　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 14th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army operating in the Shucheng-Tongcheng area recaptured Shucheng County on the night of the 11th. It annihilated a portion of the Chiang bandit security regiment and the puppet county government, capturing over a hundred guns from the enemy and seizing over 200,000 catties of grain and a portion of other resources. Shucheng was liberated by the People's Liberation Army on September 8th, and then re-occupied by the enemy on September 25th.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 14th: A unit of the East China People's Liberation Army recaptured Weihaiwei City on the 9th. The city had been occupied by the Chiang bandit reorganized 25th Division on the 5th.
    Xinhua News Agency, West Henan Front, 14th: After the Chen-Xie Western Line Army advanced into southern Shaanxi, it was warmly welcomed by the masses along the way. Upon hearing that our army had liberated Shangnan and other places, the people of Shangxian and Luonan immediately rose up to resist the Chiang bandits' grain requisition, tax collection, and conscription, requesting our army to lead them in revolution. The nine guerrilla units that had persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in southern Shaanxi for over a year were extremely excited after joining forces with the main force, and are now cooperating with the main force to fiercely attack the stubborn bandits. Tenant farmers in Longjuzhai and other places told our soldiers: "Nine out of ten people are hoping for you to come." An old woman in Tiaoping, Shangnan, said: "The Chiang government's demands for money are driving people to death. If you come and make the world a better place, I can live a good life for a few days." The masses in southern Shaanxi generally recognize that the People's Liberation Army has "four great qualities," namely, being considerate (referring to not randomly entering people's rooms, etc.), caring for the poor, engaging in fair buying and selling, and refraining from beating and scolding.

　　皖西再度克舒城胶东收复威海卫
    【新华社中原前线十四日电】活动于舒城桐城地区之解放军某部，于十一夜再度光复舒城县城。歼蒋匪保安团及伪县府一部，计俘敌人枪各百余，获粮食二十余万斤，其他资财一部。按舒城于九月八日为解放军光复，九月二十五日复为敌侵占。
    【新华社华东前线十四日电】华东解放军东线大军一部于九日收复威海卫市，该市系于五日为蒋匪整编第二十五师所侵占。
    【新华社豫西前线十四日电】陈谢西线大军挺进陕南后，备受沿途群众热烈欢迎。商县、雒南人民欣闻我军解放商南等地，立即纷起向蒋匪抗粮、抗款，抗丁，要求我军领导他们起来革命。年余以来坚持陕南敌后游击战的九支游击队与主力会合后，异常振奋，现正配合主力痛击顽匪。龙驹寨等佃农向我战士说：“十个人有九个人盼望你们来。”商南挑坪有一个老太婆说：“蒋政府要款逼死人，你们来了把天下打好，我可以过几天好光景。”陕南群众公认解放军有“四大好”，即有里有外好（指不随意进入人民内室等），爱护穷人好，公买公卖好，不打不骂好。
