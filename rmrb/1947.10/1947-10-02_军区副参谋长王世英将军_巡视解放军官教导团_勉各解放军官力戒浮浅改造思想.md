　　Military Region Deputy Chief of Staff General Wang Shiying
  　Inspects the People's Liberation Army Officer Training Regiment
  　Encourages All PLA Officers to Overcome Superficiality and Transform Their Thinking
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since its establishment, the Taihang Military Region's People's Liberation Army Officer Training Regiment has successively accommodated over 8,000 captured Nationalist army officers of various ranks from lieutenant to colonel. As of now, it still has one general officer team, four field officer teams, and fourteen company grade officer teams, totaling over 2,000 individuals. Wang, the leader of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, deeply cares about their studies and lives. Amidst the busy military operations and the army's southward advance, he specially dispatched Deputy Chief of Staff General Wang Shiying to visit them. General Wang, accompanied by Comrade Quan Bochun, arrived at the regiment on September 6th. Accompanied by the regimental leaders, he immediately visited the general officer team. Cadets Chen Guding, Luo Zhedong, Li Shouzheng, and others were all General Wang's classmates from the Whampoa Military Academy. Among them, Hu Sanyu, Shi Zebo, and others had old acquaintances with General Wang. The meeting was filled with joy. After inspecting the general officer team's clean and cool dormitories and club, General Wang first explained the military region leaders' concerns and inquired in detail about their learning and living conditions. Generally, the captured officers were sincerely grateful for the leaders' earnest concern and the generous treatment given by the people. They all felt that it was precious to be able to escape the whirlpool of civil war and have this opportunity to study. In particular, they felt that they had gained a lot by taking this opportunity to understand the correct propositions and measures of the liberated areas and the Chinese Communist Party, and they were more optimistic about the creation of a new China and its future. The next day, General Wang visited the field officer battalion again and participated in the battalion's grievance meeting, listening to the Nationalist army officers' accusations of Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous dictatorship, the Kuomintang's secret agent terror rule, and the heinous crimes of the four major families, deeply feeling that the Nationalist army was bound to be defeated. In the afternoon, he went to inspect the various company grade officer battalions and gave a current affairs report. On the morning of the 10th, General Wang Shiying again convened general and field grade PLA officers to report on current affairs, first pointing out the current situation of our army's general counter-offensive on various battlefields. He described the internal divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, factional infighting, insufficient troops, and awkward and embarrassing situation. He also pointed out the economic crisis caused by the Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen four major families' opportunistic and greedy exploitation of the people, as well as Wedemeyer's visit to China and the shameless servant-like appearance of Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous, dictatorial, and civil war government. He pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's tricks to cope with the crisis and overcome difficulties were: first, to fabricate facts and deceive extensively, touting the victory of the war, in order to boost the morale of the depressed; second, to create discord and provoke relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, using anti-communism and anti-Sovietism as an excuse to seek foreign aid, pinning his dying fate on the Third World War. General Wang refuted his rumors and deceptions, which were nothing more than burying one's head in the sand and would only be spurned. Because people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, after being deceived in this period, already had the common sense to see through traitors, had become accustomed to looking at problems from the opposite side, and facts had proven it to be very accurate. Talking about learning, Deputy Chief of Staff Wang criticized some of the insincerity, shallowness, superficiality, and blandness of learning, as well as the different tendencies and wrong ideas of solving one's own problems as the goal. He said that concrete learning should be linked to current affairs and practical problems, and the purpose is to seek wisdom, so it must be sincere, profound, and painstakingly studied. In particular, to transform consciousness and ideology, it must go through a period of pain and launch ideological struggle. He called on all officers to help each other, and through movements such as venting grievances, accusations, confession, and tracing the roots, to eliminate all feudal and backward consciousness from the mind. Otherwise, if the mind is filled with old ideas and concepts, it will never accept new things. Finally, General Wang encouraged everyone to study with peace of mind, study hard, recognize problems, understand the past, turn to the people's side, and serve the people. He also guaranteed that the past would not be held accountable, extended a hand of cooperation to everyone, and hoped that everyone would work hard to transform their thinking, start anew, and do something beneficial for the Chinese people.
    General Wang Shiying's report lasted for three hours and ended with a very high level of enthusiasm. After the officers returned to their teams, they held discussions on his report and were very excited to discuss the new situation created by the start of the counter-offensive, which indeed made Chiang Kai-shek exhausted in dealing with it. They then predicted the military, political, and other situations and the conditions of both sides, and unanimously believed that the national counter-offensive would be like sweeping away the decaying leaves, causing Chiang Kai-shek's all-round collapse and rapidly ending this day-angered and people-resented evil rule.
    In the afternoon, Deputy Chief of Staff Wang invited more than ten old friends, including Chen Yiding and Hu Sanyu, to dine together. During the meal, he also repeatedly urged them to study with peace of mind, pay attention to their health, and his earnest feelings were very touching.

    【本报讯】太行军区解放军官教导团，自成立以来，陆续收留迭次战役被俘之校尉各级军官佐八千余人，截至目前为止，尚有将官队一个，校官队四个，尉官队十四个计二千有零。晋冀鲁豫军王首长对该等之学习与生活，至为关怀，在戎马倥偬大军南渡之际，特派副参谋长聂世英将军前往慰问。王将军偕全伯纯同志于九月六日驰抵该团后，即由团首长陪同走访将级军官队。该队学员陈顾鼎、罗哲东、李守正等，皆系王将军当年黄埔同学，其中胡三余、史泽波等又与王将军有旧，会见之际，成形欢欣。王将军巡视将官队整洁凉爽之宿舍与俱乐部后，首即说明军区首长关切之意，并对学习与生活情形，垂询倍详。一般被俘军官，对首长之殷切关怀，及人民施予之优渥待遇，衷心感激，咸认自己得摆脱内战漩涡，获此学习良机，至属珍贵。尤其乘此良机得以了解解放区与中共之正确主张与措施，实感增益良多，而对新中国之创造及其前途，更表乐观。次日王将军再赴校级军官大队访问，并参与该大队学员诉苦大会，听取蒋家军官控诉蒋介石卖国独裁，特务恐怖统治与四大家族之倒行逆施等滔天罪行，深感蒋军必败。午后，转赴各尉官大队视察后，并作时事报告。十日晨，王世英将军复召集将校级解放军官，报告时事，首先指出目前各战场我军大反攻情况。蒋介石匪帮的内部分歧，派系倾轧、兵力不足、捉襟见肘、丑形窘态，蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族投机取巧残民肥己所引发的经济危机及魏德迈之来华与蒋介石卖国独裁内战政府的一副奴才像貌等无耻行径狼狈状态，并指出蒋介石应付危机克服困难的技俩，一是捏造事实，大肆欺骗，鼓吹战争胜利，以期鼓舞消沉的士气；二是制造鼓诼，挑拨苏美关系，以反共反苏为借口，谋取外援，寄托其垂死命运于第三次世界大战之上。王将军驳斥其造谣欺骗，不啻掩耳盗铃，徒遭唾弃。因蒋管区人士，在这期被欺骗之后，早已具有洞烛汉奸的常识，已习惯于从反面去看问题，而且事实证明又非常准确。谈到学习，王副参谋长批评了一部分学习的不真诚、不深刻、肤浅、平淡及以解决自己问题，目的等不同倾向与错误观念，具体地学习要联系时事，结合实际问题，目的是在求智，故须真诚、深刻、用苦功钻研，尤其要转变意识，改造思想，必须经过一番痛苦，展开思想斗争。并号召全体军官，要互相帮助，经过诉苦、控诉、坦白、追根等运动，从思想上摒除一切封建落后意识，否则脑际为旧思想观念所充塞，决不会接受新的事物。最后王将军，勉大家安心学习，努力学习，认识问题，了解过去，转向人民方面，为人民服务。并保证不咎既往，向大家伸出了合作之手，愿大家努力转变思想，从新做人，为中国老百姓作些有益的事。
    王世英将军的报告，历时三小时结束，一般情绪至为高涨。各军官归队后就其报告，举行座谈，都很兴奋的议论着反攻开始所造成的新局面，确使蒋介石穷于招架。再就军事、政治等形势及双方所具的条件来预测，一致认为全国的大反攻将会如摧枯拉朽般的使蒋介石全面崩溃、迅速结束这一天怒人怨的罪恶统治。
    午后，王副参谋长复邀宴陈颐鼎、胡三余等十余位旧友共餐，席间亦谆谆相嘱安心学习，注意身体，殷切情景，至为动人。
