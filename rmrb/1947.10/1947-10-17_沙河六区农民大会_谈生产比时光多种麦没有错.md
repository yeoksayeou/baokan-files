　　Shahe Sixth District Farmers' Congress
 　Talking about production is not wrong compared to just hoping for a good wheat harvest
    [Report from this newspaper in Shahe] The Sixth District's year-end production summary meeting was held on the 10th, turning into a "compare-the-old-days" conference. Song Qunbao of Changzhuang Village spoke first, saying: "Last year, I only harvested 280 jin of sorghum, 6 dou of millet, and more than 20 jin of cotton. When it came time to plant wheat, I couldn't even afford the seeds. This year, I was allocated more than six mu of land and formed a mutual aid group. I harvested six bags of millet, 130 mu of sesame, and also one mu and three fen of buckwheat, which should yield at least two bags. I planted six mu of wheat (including one mu of newly reclaimed land). Just speaking for myself, I am really happy this year!" Yang Fan, a woman from Xicui, said: "In the past, because my family was poor, I couldn't hold my head up high. Every year, the grain we harvested wasn't enough to eat for half a year. We barely survived on bran and wild herbs. This year, I was allocated two mu of land. In the spring, I earned more than 100 jin of rice by spinning and weaving, and I also bought 500 jin of sesame cakes. My husband joined the army. This year, we harvested fifteen or sixteen bags of millet. In the past, at most, we planted five mu of wheat and didn't have enough fertilizer. This year, we planted nineteen mu, which will be enough to eat in the future. This is all thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party. I will follow the Communist Party forever." Yi Lihua of Dadian Town said: "In the spring, the government called for planting indigo. Others said that indigo was afraid of both drought and flooding, and that it was like seeking wealth in the water, so they didn't dare to plant it. I was determined to plant it. I planted two mu first, and later I planted another one mu and seven fen. Because of the drought, I watered it a lot. In total, I harvested 210 jin. Each jin of indigo sold for 2,100 yuan. These three mu and seven fen of land made me more than 400,000 yuan. This is how I got rich by listening to the Communist Party." Zhang Dongxiang of Dongcui said: "When the call came to plant indigo in the spring, I thought it wouldn't be good not to plant it, so I allocated one and a half mu of land to waste it. I planted it very sparsely. After planting it, I thought, 'Don't let it grow well.' As expected, the seedlings didn't all come up. I was happy, so I plowed it under and planted vegetables. Now, even a good harvest is only worth more than 10,000 yuan. If I had planted the indigo well, it would have sold for at least 150,000 or 160,000 yuan. I really regret it. This is the result of not listening to the call." Liu Huanzhi of Nanwang Village said: "When it came time to plant buckwheat, everyone else was planting it, so I also bought buckwheat seeds. Someone said that buckwheat is afraid of heat, cold, and wind, and that it rarely yields a harvest. I was indecisive, so I only planted two mu and gave the buckwheat seeds to others. This year, the buckwheat grew particularly well, and I regretted it again. This time when planting wheat, I am going to plant a lot. My fourth uncle said, 'There's no fertilizer, what's the point of planting so much?' I said, 'Being indecisive leads to poverty. This time, no matter what you say, I'm going to plant a lot.' So, I planted fifteen mu. This time, I won't regret it anymore." Yang Jiacong of Fuyi Village said: "This spring, I didn't listen to the call and didn't plant indigo. Instead, I planted two mu of soybeans, which resulted in 200,000 yuan less income. But I also benefited from mutual aid in production. This time, we gained experience here. From now on, we will always listen to the Communist Party, and we will make a fortune next year!" (Gao Meng, Kui Lin)

　　沙河六区农民大会
  　谈生产比时光多种麦没有错
    【本报沙河讯】六区全年生产总结会议，于十日进行比时光大会。常庄村宋群保首先发言说：“去年我只打了二百八十斤高粱、六斗谷子、和二十多斤棉花，种麦子的时候，连麦种都买不起；今年分下六亩多地，又成起了互助组，我打下六布袋谷子，一百三十亩芝麻，还有一亩三分荞麦，顶少也能打两布袋，种了六亩麦子（内有新开荒地一亩），光我一个人，今年我真痛快！”西崔妇女杨凡的说：“从前因为俺家穷，站不在人前，每年打的粮食不够半年吃，吃糠咽菜还糊不住嘴，今年分了二亩地，春天纺织就赚一百多斤米，还买下五百斤麻饼，俺男人参了军，今年打了十五、六布袋谷，往年俺顶多种五亩麦子也没肥，今年种了十九亩，以后可够吃了，这都是共产党的领导，我要永远跟着共产党走。”褡裢镇义立华说：“春天政府号召种靛，别人都说靛又怕旱，又怕淹，水里求财，都不敢种，我就打定主意要种，先种了二亩，后来又种了一亩七，天旱浇的多，共打了二百一十斤，每斤靛卖了二千一百元，这三亩七分地就给我成了四十多万元，这就是我听共产党的话发了财。”东崔张东祥说：“春天号召种靛时，我想不种也不好，合出亩半地扔了吧，种的很稀，种上后我就心里想，千万不要出好，恰好苗子就没上齐，我高兴了，把它犁了种上菜，现在好收成也不过值一万多元，要是把靛种好，顶少能卖十五六万元，我实在后悔极了，这就是我不听号召的结果。”南汪村刘换的说：“种荞麦的时候，人家都种哩，我也买下荞麦种，有人说种荞麦又怕热又怕冻，还怕风，十年九不收，我没了主意，只种了二亩，把荞麦种给了别人，今年的荞麦就长的特别强，我又后悔了，这次种麦子，我要多种，俺四叔说：“没肥，你种那些不是瞎胡闹？”我说：“没主意受了穷，这次不管你们说啥，非多种不行，我就种上了十五亩，这次我可不再后悔了。”福益村杨家从说：“我今年春天不听号召，没种靛种了二亩黄豆，少收了二十来万，但是互助搞生产也沾了光，这次咱在这里就得了经验，以后永远听共产党话，明年咱才发大财哩。”（高孟、奎林）
