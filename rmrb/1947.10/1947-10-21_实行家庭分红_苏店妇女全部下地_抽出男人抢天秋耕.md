　　[From Our Changzhi Correspondent] In Su Village, Second District, labor hero Bi Eryun took the lead, and all auxiliary laborers in the village participated in labor. There wasn't a single idle person on the streets or at home. The slogan was: "No idle people at home or on the streets, women and children are all laboring, do whatever you can, every minute lost to harvesting is a loss." Eryun's group stipulated that auxiliary laborers would earn one work point for husking 1.5 mu of corn, with a wage of seven jin of rice, with a 30/70 split between earned wages and the household. The more you husk, the more you earn, and the more you earn, the more you keep for yourself. Eight women and two children went to the fields before dawn and husked twenty-six mu of corn in one day. Eryun's wife husked 3.2 mu in one day, more than two work points. At night, she said to her mother-in-law at home, "My arms are swollen." Her mother-in-law said, "Tomorrow, you stay home and cook, and I'll go to the fields!" Eryun's wife said, "No, the Eighth Route Army does things, and if you start, you have to finish." Niu Qiuguo's wife, who is fifty-five years old, husked 2.5 mu in one day. The group's seventy-five mu of corn was completely husked in three days. Eryun said in the field, "Organizing women and children is like having a machine. Now, with four animals plowing the land, and assigning labor based on ability, three male laborers and four women are responsible for threshing in the field, and the remaining laborers are participating in digging the ground." Du Chouren's group separated the women with bound feet from those with unbound feet. Six women with unbound feet harvested grain and husked corn in distant fields every day, while seven women with bound feet harvested grain and husked corn in nearby fields and fields close to home, earning one liang of rice for every harvested grain. The women harvested in the fields as if they were racing, and seven women with bound feet harvested eight mu of grain in one morning. After harvesting this piece, they moved to the next. The women were all racing to run ahead. Chouren's wife said, "Whoever runs faster, harvests more, and earns more rice." Erzhao's group arranged life into three types. Three temporary groups with twenty-five full laborers harvested grain in distant fields. Eighteen young women harvested in fields that were not too far or too near. Old women, old men, and women with children harvested grain in fields near their homes. The whole group left two old women at home to watch the door and cook, and all the remaining men and women went to the fields. Forty-two laborers harvested more than one hundred mu of grain in one day. Two children were very active and were rewarded with two books. The whole group had twenty-two full laborers and two animals. Eight full laborers were selected to continue harvesting and threshing grain with the women, and the remaining laborers and animals all launched a concentrated autumn cultivation. These activists were praised on the public blackboard that day and on the radio platform at night, which promoted the Huangquanshui group, the Zhao Guoshun group, the Wang Huaizhen group, and the Wei Xiaohai group to go to the fields without hesitation. For example, the Huangquanshui group husked twenty mu of corn with six people before dawn. Qin Mianze, Meng Feidan, and five other groups went to the fields after locking their doors. In the afternoon, when they were walking home, the women of the Liu Donggou and Shen Fuyou groups were carrying things, the children were carrying things on their shoulders, and the old women were carrying things as well. The whole village was truly and comprehensively organized. According to statistics for two days, 328 male laborers, 556 women, 144 children, and 128 old men participated, harvesting 743.5 mu of grain and husking 1,888 mu of corn. The whole village rushed to plant wheat on 713 mu, and all of it has been planted. Twenty animals have already begun plowing.
