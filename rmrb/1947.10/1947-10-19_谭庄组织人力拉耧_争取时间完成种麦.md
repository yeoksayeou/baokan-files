　　Tanzhuang Organizes Manpower to Pull Seed Drills
　　Seizing Time to Complete Wheat Planting
　　[Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 17th] The people of Tanzhuang, Nanfeng Third District, do not use oxen to grind flour, but use manpower to pull seed drills for planting, saving oxen for plowing. The entire village has 13 hectares of land, with a plan to plant 10 hectares of wheat, striving to complete plowing and planting in five days. On the evening of the 24th of last month, the masses in the village held a meeting to discuss the wheat planting situation. Each group reported that a total of more than 53 hectares of land had been plowed in the village, with 8.6 hectares of land remaining unplowed. Furthermore, due to rain and other reasons, most of the wheat had not been planted, except for a few hectares. At the meeting, everyone was worried that their wheat would not be planted. For this reason, Tan Xichang and Tan Ximeng even argued because Tan Xichang had plowed 0.13 hectares of his land, but still had 0.27 hectares unplowed, so he advocated plowing first and then planting, while Tan Ximeng's land had been completely plowed, and he advocated planting first. "Plant first? Plow first?" This triggered a debate among everyone. After discussion, it was decided that the 31 oxen and two donkeys in the village would concentrate their strength on plowing the land. Grinding flour was not allowed to use oxen, and planting wheat would be done by manpower pulling seed drills. The slogan "Strive to complete plowing and planting in five days" was put forward, and manpower for pulling the drills was specifically organized on the spot. In the end, it was calculated that the manpower was still not enough. At that time, comrades from the stationed village organs who attended the meeting also proactively offered to contribute two animals and ten full laborers to participate in pulling the drills. In this way, when the meeting adjourned, everyone had great confidence in completing plowing and planting, and no longer worried about whether their wheat would be planted. After the meeting, the village cadres discussed it further and proposed to strive to exceed the original plan, striving to plant 10 hectares of wheat, accounting for more than 75 percent of the total land area.
　　[Another Dispatch] In order to solve the wheat seed difficulties of poor peasants, the Nanfeng County government specially issued loans of 7 million yuan. Cadres from various districts are heading to various villages to investigate the actual situation of those lacking wheat seeds in order to provide loans as appropriate.

　　谭庄组织人力拉耧
  　争取时间完成种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】南峰三区谭庄磨面不用牛，耩地人拉耧，省下牛犁地。全村十三顷地，计划种十顷麦，争取五天耕完种完。上月二十四日晚，该村群众开会讨论种麦情形，各组汇报共计全村已耕八百多亩地，尚有一百三十六亩地未耕。并因下雨、支零差等原因，除少数几亩，大部麦子都没有种上。会上大家都很耽心自己的麦子种不上，为此谭希昌和谭希孟甚至争吵起来，因谭希昌地已耕二亩，还有四亩未耕，所以他主张先耕后种，而谭希孟的地已耕完，他主张先耩。“先耩呢？先耕呢？”就引起了大家的争论，经过讨论，决定全村的三十一头牛、两头驴，集中力量耕地，磨面不准用牛，耩麦由人拉耧，提出“争取五天耕完耩完”的口号，并当场具体组织拉耧的人力，最后计算人力还不够用，当时驻村机关参加会的同志，也主动提出可抽两个牲口和十个全劳力参加拉耧，这样，在散会的时候，大家对耕完耩完信心都很大，不再耽心谁的麦子种不上了。散会后，村干又讨论了一下，提出要争取超过原计划，争取种十顷麦子占总地亩数的百分之七十五强。
    【又讯】南峰县府为了解决贫农的麦种困难，特发放贷款七百万元，各区干部正分头到各村调查缺乏麦种的实际情况，以便酌情贷下。
