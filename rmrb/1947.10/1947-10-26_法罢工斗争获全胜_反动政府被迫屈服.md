Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. A dispatch from Paris: The strike of Paris transportation workers, led by the French General Confederation of Labor (75 percent of whose leaders are members of the French Communist Party), ended in complete victory after eight days of perseverance, defeating the "tough" policy of the Ramadier government in executing American orders. The Ramadier authorities' surrender came after a final ultimatum-like statement issued on the 20th by Communist Ennaff, Secretary-General of the Paris Labor Union. Ennaff declared on that day that if the government did not agree to the demands of the General Confederation of Labor, all workers in the capital would oppose the government on the evening of the 20th and implement a general strike. Prior to Ennaff's statement, Bridges, Chairman of the US Senate Appropriations Committee, who went to France to interfere in the elections, publicly incited the French authorities on the 17th to "be tough in negotiations with the strikes incited by the Communists." Ramadier had also stated that he would refuse to negotiate with the workers before they returned to work, and even threatened to use force against the strikers. However, ultimately intimidated by the threat of a general strike, the Ramadier government and the capitalists indicated on the 19th that they were willing to accept the demands of the General Confederation of Labor. At that time, no agreement was reached, solely because the government refused to accept the General Confederation of Labor's request that wages be paid as usual during the strike. French Minister of Labor Meyer, one of the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party, even said: "Strike pay cannot be given as if it were a holiday." However, the workers persisted in their demands, and as a result of the struggle, according to a United Press dispatch on the 21st: "The government has almost agreed to all the demands of the strikers." (Note: The main demands of the Paris Labor Union were: to pay workers a temporary subsidy of 15 to 20 percent before the wage revision on December 1st.)
　　French national shipping employees, who went on strike in response to the strike by Paris subway and bus workers, overcame the government's resistance after two days of persistence and achieved a 15 percent wage increase victory on the 18th.

　　法罢工斗争获全胜
  　反动政府被迫屈服
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合巴黎讯：法国总工会（该会负责人百分之七十五是法共党人）所领导的巴黎交通工人罢工，于坚持八天后，击败拉马第政府执行美国命令的“强硬”政策，而以获得完全的胜利宣告结束。拉马第当局的屈服，是在巴黎工联总书记共产党人恩那弗二十日发出最后通牒性质的声明之后，恩那弗是日宣称：假如政府不答应总工会的要求，二十日晚首都一切工人将反对政府，而实行总罢工。恩那弗声明前，赴法干与选举的美参院拨款委员会主席勃里奇十七日曾公开教唆法当局“在与共产党煽起的罢工谈判中必须强硬”。拉马第亦曾表示在复工以前拒绝与工人谈判，甚至威吓着要用武力对付罢工者，但终因慑于总罢工的威逼，拉马第政府及资方在十九日表示愿接受总工会要求，当时未成协议，仅由于政府方面拒绝接受总工会所提罢工期间工资照付的要求。法劳工部长社会党右派领袖之一梅耶竟称：“不能把罢工象节日一样付给工资。”然工人坚持自己要求，斗争结果，据合众社二十一日电称：却是“政府几乎同意了罢工者的一切要求。”（按：巴黎工会之主要要求为：在十二月一日工资修订前，付与工人百分之十五至二十的临时补助。）
    为响应巴黎地下铁路及公共汽车工人罢工而实行罢工的法国全国航运员工，于坚持两日后，即克服政府方面的抵抗而于十八日获得增加工资百分之十五的胜利。
