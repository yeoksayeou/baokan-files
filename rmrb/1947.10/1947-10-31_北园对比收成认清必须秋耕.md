　　In Qinyuan's Beiyuan Village, 575 mu of autumn land were left unplowed last year, resulting in a reduction of 287.5 shi of grain this year. According to an investigation, Tang Renwu's and Ma Liandao's four mu of land, which were plowed last year, yielded 74 ears of grain, capable of producing more than eight shi; Li An's four mu of land bordering theirs, which were not autumn-plowed last year, produced corn stalks as thick as thumbs this year. Tang Yuan's four mu plot, two mu of which were autumn-plowed last year, yielded 44 ears of grain, while the two mu that were not autumn-plowed yielded only 20 ears. Liu Yun's two and a half mu of land, which was dug over last year, yielded 40 ears of grain, while Guo Fusheng's three mu of spring-plowed land yielded only 25 ears of grain. This clear comparison proves that crops from land not autumn-plowed yield half as much as those from autumn-plowed land, and that autumn digging is as good as autumn plowing, while spring plowing is not as good as autumn plowing. After such vivid comparisons, the masses recognized the importance of autumn-plowed land and became more convinced of the old saying: "A kick in the autumn is worth a hoe in the spring," and "Scratching the skin in the autumn is better than plowing ten times in the spring." Therefore, the village guarantees that all autumn land will be plowed once this year.

　　北园对比收成认清必须秋耕
    【本报太岳二十九日电】沁源北园村去年五百七十五亩秋地没垡，今年少打粮食二百八十七石五斗。据调查，该村唐人武、马莲道的四亩地，去年垡过，今年割了七十四个谷，能打八石以上，和他交界的李安的四亩地，去年没秋垡，今年的玉茭长的有大姆指粗；唐元的一块四亩，去年秋垡过二亩，今年割了四十四个谷，没秋垡的二亩只割了二十个；刘云去年刨过的二亩半地割谷四十个，郭福生的三亩春垡地谷只割了二十五个。这样显明的对比，证明不垡秋地的庄稼比秋垡地的少收一半，秋刨地和秋垡地一样，春垡地不如秋垡地好。经过这样活生生的对比后，群众认识了秋垡地的重要，更加相信了“秋天踢一脚，顶住春天刨一镢”，“秋天划破皮，强似春天犁十犁”的老话，所以该村保证今年秋地要普遍垡过一次。
