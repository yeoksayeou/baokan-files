    I. Price Trends:
    Grain
    At the beginning of the month, rain fell in various border areas, raising hopes for the autumn harvest, and grain prices immediately tended to decline and then stabilize. However, after the second ten days of the month, various places were busy with the autumn harvest, and the supply of grain decreased as the old grain was running out and the new grain had not yet come in, and prices rebounded. In addition, the price of wheat, which is needed for autumn plowing and wheat sowing, was higher than other grains and rose faster.

    一、物价动态：
    粮食
    月初边区各地先后落雨，秋收有望，粮价直趋下降，继平；至下旬以后，各地忙于秋收，新旧不接，粮来源减，价复挺。又秋耕麦种所需，麦价高于他粮且快。岳北上旬粮由波转平：和川米每市斗八百五十元，跌为七百五十元，麦子一千五百元，跌到一千四百元，中旬米七百元，麦子一千二百元；下旬米未变，麦升为一千二百五十元。晋城上旬：新米上市每市斗一千元，陈米由八百五十元跌为七百五十元，麦子一千三百元，玉茭五百五十元。廿三日米麦皆升：米一千二百元，麦一千五百元，至月终米降为八百元，麦仍为一千五百元。济源上旬米升每斗二千一百元，麦子一千六百八十元，玉茭一千一百元；二十日各粮均降：小米一千八百元，麦子一千四百元，玉茭九百元。二十六日续下：小米一千六百五十元，麦子一千三百八十元。晋南新区粮平稳：平陆二十五日麦一千元左右，玉茭六百五十元。永济粮价特廉：小米五百五十元（以上各地均系市斗计）。太行：长治五日米麦（市斗）均为一千二百元，玉茭六百五十元。十三日米销壶关价挺，为一千三百五十元，十五日回跌为一千二百元；麦升为一千四百元，玉茭降为四百五十元。二十日粮上市减，价复提：米一千五百元，麦一千六百元。阳邑上半月米先落后平，麦先落继升，杂豆平；五日米每市斤一百三十元，麦子一百三十五元，玉茭八十元，十二日落，米一千一百五十元，麦子一千二百元；十六日米一百廿元，麦一千二百五十元，二十二日——二十七日米仍为一百二十元，麦为一百三十元，玉茭八十元。高邑粮由升转平，四日至十七日小米每大斗四千四百元，麦子四千六百元，玉茭二千五百元，二十七日各粮价未变，销快。邢台四日至十四日秋粮稳落，米（平斤）一百廿七元，玉茭九十三元，各粮较八月终下降一四元——廿三元，惟麦未变仍为一百三十四元。廿五日米麦复升：米一百三十四元，麦一百五十元。邯郸上旬新红粮上市价疲，他粮平稳；八月米每平斤一百二十五元，麦一百二十四元稍硬，红粮八十元，黑豆一百廿六元，各粮日成交四千余斤；中旬中秋节到，酒坊赶烧酒吸收粮食之伙，麦杂较尖，米平。下旬米未变，麦升为一百三十元，杂粮跌。月来各粮仍来自东南濮阳漳南一带，日进三万至五万斤，米销当地及临铭关界河店，麦销当地磨坊及武安。冀南上中旬各地价平，下旬微挺；夏津各粮价低，一日至十五日米（斤）七十元，麦由九十六元提为一百元，红粮五十元，廿三日米升为七十五元，麦杂未变。衡水三日至十五日米持平每斤一百元，麦尖挺由一百零九元升为一百一十六元，下旬各粮价未变销快。南宫缺雨又受冀中价高的影响，粮价水平较冀南为高，一日至十八日，米麦每斤（一六秤）为一百三十五元左右，新红粮上市，价由一百元落为八十元，下旬米未变，麦升为一百五十元。临清上旬，以天雨粮上市减，小米由八十七元升为九十二元，麦七十八元，玉茭五十六元，下旬米升为九十六元，麦升一百零一元，红粮由四十九元，升为五十一元。冀鲁豫上旬粮平稳，下旬因战争关系，并受黄河南粮上升影响，亦呈昂挺；沿黄河一带涨势较猛，濮阳廿日前小米每双市斗一千五百元，麦子一千六百元，红粮八百元，下旬米麦均升为二千元左右。清丰六塔上旬米（双市斗）一千五百元，麦一千六百元，红粮七百五十元。阳谷三十日小米每斗三千一百元，麦三千三百元，较上旬升八百——一千元。月来本区粮食特点：麦昂、米平、杂粮跌，各粮价格，先降、旋平、后复升，基本上呈平稳。
    棉花
    本区棉花价月来呈疲：冀鲁豫濮阳十日前尚能向新乡方面出口，价昂，每斤七百五十元，后出少，价落为七百——六百五十元。冀南新花上市，夏津棉先降、后升旋跌，月初出口不顺，由四百八十元跌为四百二十元，十三日出多，复提四百七十元，二十日回跌四百六十元，多运德州换盐。衡水十三日棉由七百元升为八百元，十五日回为七百五十元，二十五日继跌为七百——六百五十元，亦多销德州。临清上旬出口锐减、价疲，由五百七十元，跌为五百四十元，至月终价未变。南宫棉先跌后升：一日——十八日由六百元降为五百九十元，下旬复提六百四十元。邯郸因东西线销路不畅，价跌。月初好棉五百四十元，次五百元，八日新花上市量多，继跌为四百六十元，次四百四十元。十八日以后西线购客稍涌，好货复提为四百六十五元快，次货疲，日平均成交三千至五千斤，多销东面——德州换盐及到濮阳出口一部。二十三日以后，天雨，棉销少，价未变。太行太岳，因受各地价疲影响，并济源口岸闭塞，一般价疲，惟高邑因花销了皇及当地纺织所需，较快，十二日至廿七日由五百七十元升到六百六十元，每集上花四万余斤多来自赵县，全销完。友邻区及蒋区九月份棉升，德州上半月每斤五百元，月终升为五百八十元，上旬惠民五百元，乐陵五百二十元（以上均北币），新集月初净棉已升六千元，二十四日回跌为五千七百元（边币）。晋绥吕梁兑九峪九月初，五千元（农币）。蒋管区棉飞鹰：济南上半月由一百二十五万升为一百九十万，月终续涨为二百四十万元。青岛月初由一百七十二万元升为一百八十五万元。天津上旬一百八十五万元月终三百万元。沪十月初三百五十万元，徐州二百六十五万元。北平中旬三百万元（百斤价）。
    土布
    月来各地土布一般平稳，平销。冀鲁豫濮阳一日至三十日每双尺二百四十——二百二十元，中旬徐镇二百二十元，道口二百五十元（以上尺七码）。清丰双尺二百四十元。冀南临清上旬每尺（尺七码）二百二十元，中旬二百四十元，下旬二百三十五——二百二十元。南宫一日至三十日均为二百四十元，衡水十五日布走冀中价升由二百一十二升为二百四十元，三十日升为二百五十元。上旬广平二百六十元，曲周二百四十元销快，全走邯郸。邯郸上旬疲，每双市尺二百五十元次一百九十元，中旬天雨销少降为二百四十元，次二百元，下旬升为二百七十元次二百一十元，平均日成交数千斤，仍销西线。太行除高邑平定活跃外，余均平淡。高邑十一日——十七日每尺二百元，逢集布上市八百余匹，销十分之八走赞皇及山西。平定因与冀晋毗连，布销路广：上旬每市尺一百五十元，快。长治上半月每尺（一六码）二百四十元，下旬落为二百三十元。太岳晋城上旬每市尺一百四十元——一百五十元，下旬跌为一百三十五元。济源上旬（匹）四千五百元，三十日四千八百元——五千元。新区晋南平陆每裁尺二百廿元。寒冬即到布看活跃。
    土产山货
    太岳种靛不少，今年收成颇佳，现新土靛已上市，郭道上旬每斤一千元，晋城下旬每斤八百元。花椒及黄花菜涉县上旬活跃：花椒每斤一百元快，花菜三百五十元。皮毛上半月活跃：大营白羊皮二千八百元，黑皮一千八百元快，邢台白皮二千七百元，黑皮一千五百元，全走大营出口，下旬因出口不顺显疲。
    食盐
    本区旧存底丰，且来源不断，一般仍呈平疲。兹将各地盐价列次：冀鲁豫平稳，濮阳一日至卅日均为一百五十元，中旬阳谷一百六十元，徐镇一百七十元，道口二百元，黄河南物价突出：郓巨九月十日海盐一斤八百元。冀南一般平降；临清上中旬一百零五元，下旬一百元。南宫一百五十元，衡水上旬一百三十五元，下旬升为一百四十元，邯郸上旬由一百四十五元降为一百三十元，中旬未变，日平均成交四千余斤，下旬因两市状沉静，又货入减少价升为一百三十五元，盐来自馆陶，多销彭城。太行高邑一百六十元，邢台一百三十四元，阳邑一百四十五元，涉县一百六十元，长治上半月二百三十元，下旬跌为二百元，太岳济源上旬盐走孟县大涨，每斤由二百三十元涨为三百元（孟县盐奇缺，五百元一斤），中旬以后趋平，回跌为二百五十元左右。晋城海盐上旬二百三十元，中下旬二百五十元，潞盐一百九十——二百元。新区平陆下旬六十元，晋南同蒲线上潞盐一般六十——五十元之间。
    外货：月来火柴先涨后平；纸张抬头；颜料——青涨，靛落。糖类由升转降销快。上升原因：一、敌严加封锁，出货不易，一切花项大、成本高。二、军事行动，运输困难。三、敌区价涨：九月初济南火柴四十五万元。天津九月上半月粉连纸由十九万升到二十八万元。按十五元折本币一万八千六百元以上，再加运费税洋及其他花销，其底非小。惟靛因土产较丰价廉，故外靛呈下降之势。
    二、金融情况
    汇价：汇价先涨后跌。蒋币自我大军南征以来，更形扫地。上半月东方棉出口量减，外货入量却巨，故汇价呈涨：临清上旬津汇由六百五十升为六百七十，日成交二亿元，夏津上升津汇由六百七十升为七百二十，济汇六百五十元升为六百七十元，中旬敌区棉价大涨（济南由一百二十五万升为一百九十万元）出口有利，故汇价跌，临清津汇跌为六百元，济汇跌为五百九十元。衡水上半月津汇为六百三十元，月终为六百元。高邑十三日至十七日蒋币十五元，邢台一日至二十日蒋币十五元，月终为二十四元。济源九月上旬蒋币十二元。冀鲁豫九月中旬长垣十二．五元，滑县二十元，高陵井店二十五元，张秋二十元。
    金银价：月来金价一般平稳，惟太岳区较高。冀鲁豫九月中旬，银元颇高，金尚平，道口金牌价十四万元，银圆一千二百元。长垣黑市金二十万元，银元一千八百元。邯郸上旬黑市金十五万元，邢台上旬黑市十七万元。太岳中旬晋城金牌价十五万元，银元七百元。济源黑市二十万元，银元一千元。新绛黑市金三十万元，稷山黑市二十五万元，平陆牌价十二万元。
