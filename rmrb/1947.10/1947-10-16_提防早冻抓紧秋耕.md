　　Guard Against Early Frosts, Seize the Time for Autumn Cultivation
    Currently, the autumn harvest and wheat planting are approaching the final intense stage. To prepare for increased grain production in the spring of next year, it is hoped that all regions will pay attention to overcoming complacency, continue to display the spirit of seizing the harvest and planting to overcome the drought, adjust and organize labor and livestock, and launch an autumn cultivation (autumn fallowing) campaign.
    Autumn cultivation can eliminate insects and weeds, increase and preserve moisture, and improve the soil. This is generally known to farmers, and many regions have this habit. However, to make autumn cultivation a widespread mass movement this year, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of this year's autumn cultivation and overcome specific difficulties: First, this year's autumn crops ripen at different times, autumn harvesting and wheat planting are being carried out simultaneously, and there has been a lot of rain this autumn, so early frost is possible, and the time for autumn cultivation will be even shorter; and autumn cultivation work requires sufficient labor and livestock to be competent. Therefore, it is necessary to guard against early frost and seize the time, have unified leadership, and make appropriate arrangements for this work to achieve scientific scheduling of labor and livestock. Some regions have already implemented the "one-pot cooking" method for autumn harvesting and wheat planting, and autumn cultivation should be included. The method of contracting autumn cultivation in Ping Shun Seventh District can also be used as a reference for various regions. In this work, special attention should be paid to solving the difficulties of the poor and hired laborers, so that the land of poor peasants who lack labor and livestock can also complete autumn cultivation. Secondly, there have been many difficulties during the production period this year, and the leaders and the masses have been very busy in overcoming drought and pests. Generally, there is a lack of ideological preparation for autumn cultivation work, and even in areas that have the habit of autumn cultivation, it is easy to become lax after a year of hard work. Therefore, it is hoped that district and village cadres and labor hero comrades will promote and organize early in areas that are not yet ready to carry out autumn cultivation; and in areas where the masses have already started autumn cultivation, they must be quickly organized and managed to continue and universally and rapidly carry out the plan for autumn cultivation and autumn harvest.

### 提防早冻抓紧秋耕

　　提防早冻抓紧秋耕
    目前秋收种麦已接近最后紧张阶段，为准备明年春耕增产食粮，希望各地注意克服松一口气的思想，继续发挥抢收抢种战胜旱灾的精神，调整与组织劳畜力，开展秋耕（秋垡地）运动。
    秋耕可以除虫、除草，增加与保存水份以及改良土壤，这是一般农民都知道而且许多地区都有这个习惯的。但今年要把秋耕成为普遍的群众性运动，就必须了解今年秋耕的特点与克服具体困难：首先是今年秋禾迟早不等，秋收种麦同时进行，而今秋雨多，地冻可能早，秋耕时间将会更加短促；且秋耕工作要有足够的劳畜力才能胜任。因此，必须提防早冻抓紧时间，统一领导，适当安排这一工作，做到科学的调度劳畜力。有些地区已实行秋收种麦“一锅煮”的办法，应把秋耕包括进去。平顺七区包工秋耕的办法，亦可供各地参考采用。在这工作中，应特别注意解决贫雇困难，使缺乏劳力、畜力的贫苦农民的土地，也能完成秋耕。其次今年生产期间困难颇多，领导与群众为战胜旱灾、虫害曾十分繁忙，对秋耕工作一般缺乏思想准备，即便有秋耕习惯的地区，亦容易因辛苦一年而产生松懈情绪。因此，希望区村干部和劳动英雄同志们，对尚未准备进行秋耕的地区，要及早提倡、组织；而群众已经开始秋耕的地区，则须要迅即加以组织和管理，把秋耕和秋收的计划坚持下去与普遍迅速进行起来。
