　　Qi-Yu Inland Masses Support Border Area Autumn Harvest
　　[Report from this newspaper in the Ji-Lu-Yu area on the 1st] The Qi-Yu Second District mobilized the masses in the inland areas to help the masses in the border areas with the autumn harvest. The bandit Wang Er Zhua Ji's troops in the Qi-Yu Second District constantly harassed our border areas, setting fires, arresting people, leading away cattle, and looting. The masses reflected, "This year's crops are the best in years, but there's no way to harvest them." On the 9th, our local corps of the × Unit moved into this area. Deputy County Chief Xiao and Second District Chief Sun discussed and decided to mobilize the masses from the inland areas to help the masses in the border areas with the emergency harvest. That evening, District Chief Sun returned and immediately conveyed the message to the cadres. Everyone felt it was a good idea and immediately set off to mobilize the masses in various villages. By dawn, more than 300 people had gathered. The principle that "peasants are one family under heaven" was explained, and the masses were highly enthusiastic. Later, district cadres coordinated with the masses and divided them into three villages: Huangtun, Luzhuang, and Yuanzhuang. That morning, they finished harvesting the sorghum and millet in Yuanzhuang and Luzhuang, and two-thirds of the crops in Huangtun. The masses in the border area expressed their deep gratitude. But just after noon, the sentry militia discovered the enemy again. So they bravely rushed forward and safely covered the retreat of the masses.
　　In Puyang, the east and west rivers were opened, and a total of 122 students, divided into two platoons, participated in the autumn harvest. They were responsible for 250 mu of land belonging to the families of soldiers, and proposed mutual competition and selection of models for commendation. Most of the land they were responsible for has been harvested and threshed. The masses all said, "The students are really capable, even faster than big carts when crossing the water!"

　　齐禹内地群众支援边地秋收
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】齐禹二区动员内地群众，帮助边沿区群众秋收。齐禹二区顽匪王二抓鸡部，不断扰我边沿区，放火抓人牵牛抢东西，群众反映说：“几年来，今年的庄稼最好，可是没法子收。”九日我地方兵团×部队，到这一带活动，萧副县长与二区孙区长研究决定由内地动员群众来帮助边沿区群众抢收，当晚孙区长回来，立即向干部传达，大家觉得是好办法，就马上出发，到各村动员群众，天明时即已集合了三百多人，又说明“天下农民是一家”的道理，群众情绪很高涨，后由区干协同群众，分到黄屯、卢庄、袁庄三村，当天上午就割完了袁庄、卢庄的高粱及谷子，黄屯也收了三分之二，边沿区群众表示十分感激。但刚过午，岗哨民兵又发现敌人。于是勇猛冲上去，安全掩护群众回来。
    濮阳东西开河，共有学生一百二十二名，分为两个中队，参加秋收，他们负责二百五十亩抗属地，并提出互相竞赛，选模表扬，他们负责的这些地，已大部收打完毕，群众都说：“学生们真能干，隔着水，自己比大车动的还快哩！”
