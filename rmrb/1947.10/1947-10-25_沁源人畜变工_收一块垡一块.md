　　Qin Yuan: People and Livestock Exchange Labor
　　Reaping and Plowing Simultaneously
　　[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Taiyue, dated 23rd] Qin Yuan County is simultaneously harvesting and plowing. In Shangwan and Luerhui villages in the First District of the county, under the leadership of female labor hero Hu Rangniu and others, after harvesting the millet within five days starting from October 10th, they immediately began autumn plowing. Fourteen teams of livestock plowed 35 mu on the first day, averaging 2.5 mu per team per day. Other villages, such as Mawu and Maleng in the Second District, have all organized cattle teams and started autumn plowing on October 12th. In the organization of labor and livestock, teams are formed based on the size of the cattle team and the technical skills of the plowmen, with particular attention paid to respecting older farmers and mobilizing them to participate in plowing. After organizing fourteen teams of livestock, Mayang Village handed them over to experienced farmers such as Chen Xiaodan and Chen Shuiwang for fixed use. Yaobi also formed autumn plowing teams with eleven teams of livestock and older farmers with high plowing skills. Regardless of whose land it is, they plow one plot after reaping one plot, starting with the distant fields and moving to the closer ones, aiming to plow everything. In the exchange of labor and livestock, the principle of benefiting people, benefiting the land, and especially benefiting the livestock is followed, with equivalent exchange. In villages such as Luerhui and Shangwan, plowing one mu is equivalent to ten work points, plus providing grass and feed for the cattle, with six sheng of beans per day for a team of large cattle and four sheng per day for a team of small cattle. The wage for plowing one mu is eight sheng of rice. In Yaobi, one team (two cattle) of large oxen accompanied by one person is equivalent to four person-days of labor; one team of cows accompanied by one person is equivalent to three person-days of labor; a team of cows and oxen combined accompanied by one person is equivalent to three and a half person-days of labor. The method of assigning work points is: individuals declare first, and then everyone re-evaluates and decides.
