Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd. Following the good news of capturing Yanchuan, Yanchang, and the victories of the offensive in Guanzhong, a spokesperson for the Northwest People's Liberation Army Headquarters said to reporters with a smile, "Today is probably a very headache day for Hu Zongnan." Regarding the current situation of the Northwest battlefield's major counter-offensive, the spokesperson said, "The PLA, coordinating from north and south, launching attacks from all directions, has made Hu Zongnan panic and unable to attend to all fronts. The five or six brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's army, which have retreated to the isolated city of Yan'an, have been shattered and are in a dilemma. Because he has to defend Yan'an, losing Yan'an would affect the appearance to China and foreign countries and the morale of Chiang's army; but Guanzhong must be rescued, otherwise, if the base camp is lost, the entire army will be wiped out. But no matter whether Hu Zongnan takes care of the south or the north, he will not escape the fate of failure." At this point, the spokesperson traced the progress of the counter-offensive armies, saying: "Since the great victory at Chakou in mid-September, our army has launched a large-scale sweep of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops near Yan'an, successively capturing important strongholds east and north of Yan'an, such as Yaodianzi, Qinghuabian, Yongping, Panlong, Ganguyi, and Long'an. Now Yanchuan and Yanchang have been completely recovered, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops have been forced to retreat to a corner of Yan'an. Another large army of ours has driven straight in, directly attacking the nest of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, the great Guanzhong, and after liberating Baishui County, northeast of Xi'an, continued to expand the offensive, capturing more than ten important towns in the counties of Pucheng, Baishui, Tongguan, and Yijun, inserting a sharp knife into Hu Zongnan's heart. At the same time, another large army advanced into the area east of Luochuan, which was ruled by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and captured strongholds such as Guanfu on the Luo (chuan) Yi (chuan) highway and Jiuxian, 20 kilometers east of Luochuan, cooperating with our army that occupied Da Xiaolaoshan south of Yan'an, completely cutting off the communication lines of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in the triangular area of Yan'an, Luochuan, and Yichuan. The more unfavorable situation of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops has made the Central News Agency, which not long ago was still boasting that the Northwest PLA 'has been wiped out,' recently become silent and dare not say a word." The spokesperson pointed out in conclusion: "Looking at the current war situation, the time for the PLA to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is not far off."

　　西北解放军总部发言人称
    延安完全孤立
    困守蒋胡匪进退不得
    【新华社西北三日电】攻克延川、延长及关中出击捷报传来时，西北人民解放军总部发言人笑语记者：“今天怕是胡宗南很头痛的一天。”谈及目前西北战场大反攻的形势，该发言人称：“解放军南北呼应，纵横夹击，已使胡宗南手忙脚乱，顾此失彼。溃退到延安孤城的胡宗南唯一机动兵力五六个旅，被打得丧魂落魄，进退两难。因为不能不守延安，失了延安怕影响中外观瞻和蒋军士气；可是关中又不能不救，否则老巢不保，必致全军覆没。但不管胡宗南顾南还是顾北，总归逃不出失败的命运。”至此，发言人追溯各路反攻大军的进展情况谓：“上月中旬岔口大捷以来，我军即大举扫荡延安附近之蒋胡匪军，连克延安以东及以北之姚店子、青化砭、永坪、蟠龙、甘谷驿、龙安等重要据点。现延川、延长又告光复，蒋胡匪军已被迫退缩延安一隅。而我另部大军则长驱直入，直捣蒋胡匪军的巢穴大关中，于解放西安东北之白水县城后，继续扩展攻势，在蒲城、白水、同官、宜君等县区内，攻克重要市镇十余处，向胡宗南的心脏插入一把锋利的刀子。同时，另部大军则挺进蒋匪统治之洛川以东地区，攻克洛（川）宜（川）公路上之关抚及洛川东二十公里之旧县等据点，配合攻占延安南大小劳山我军，将延安、洛川、宜川三角地带间的蒋胡匪军交通线完全切断。蒋胡匪军处境的更加不利，使不久以前还在吹嘘西北解放军‘已被肃清’的中央社，最近已鸦雀无声，不敢吭气了。”发言人于结语时指出：“纵观目前的战局，解放军纵陕甘宁边区完全肃清蒋胡匪军的时间，已为期不远。”
