　　Breaking the "Eat All Autumn If Harvest is Good" Mentality
　　Xiyang Masses Continue to Economize
　　[This newspaper, Xiyang News] During the autumn harvest, the masses developed the idea of "eat all autumn if the harvest is good." For example, the masses in Beizhangcheng were eating cornbread buns, river noodles, and rice porridge extravagantly, wasting food. At this time, the leadership immediately convened a systematic meeting, mobilizing the masses to plan for the long term and not forget past hunger after a temporary full stomach. Following this, slogans such as "Don't forget to eat more bran in the fall, save grain to get through the famine" were proposed. This reminded the masses. For example, Li Sanwen said, "In the past, every autumn I would eat river noodles and cornbread for the entire autumn, which would be equivalent to two months of regular meals. This autumn, I guarantee I will mix in bran and not waste anything." At this time, everyone was calculating their own possessions, recognizing the difficulties, and making plans. For example, Li Fuyuan said, "This autumn, I have already mixed dou peng dou (a local measurement) of bran. I calculate that each person can save two he of rice per meal compared to previous autumns." This prompted the masses to calculate their own situations. Following this, a village-wide plan was made: the whole village has 700 people, and if each person saves two and a half he of rice per day, they can save fifty-two shi and five dou in a month. This number also startled the masses. Similarly, Nanzhuang Village in the Fifth District discovered the same mentality during the autumn harvest. For example, Qilaigou said, "My livestock are still grinding flour and carrying grain! The work is heavy in the fall, so we have to eat better! Besides, let's till as much land as we can!" Everyone disagreed with this idea. Zhang Jian said, "It's better to have a trickle than a dry well." After getting through this thinking of the masses, a movement to save and economize was launched.

　　打破“收不收吃一秋”思想
  　昔阳群众继续节约
    【本报昔阳讯】在收耕中群众产生了“收不收吃一秋”思想，如北掌城群众吃的玉茭面窝窝、河捞、捞饭，浪费起来，这时领导上便马上召开了系统会议，动员群众从长期打算，不要一饱忘了百饥。接着提出：“秋天不忘多吃糠，省下粮食渡灾荒”等口号，这样提醒了群众，如李三文说：“我过去每年秋天吃的河捞玉茭面，整吃一秋天，能顶平时两个月，今秋天我保证要搅糠，决不浪费。”这时大家都在计算自己的家当，认识了困难，订出计划，如李富元说：“我今秋已搅了斗碰斗的糠，计算每人每顿比往年秋天能省二合米。”引起群众都在计算自己，接着订出全村计划：全村共七百口人，每人每天省二合半米，一月能省五十二石五斗。这一数字也惊醒了群众。又如五区南庄村，在收耕中发现同样思想，如起来狗说：“我的牲口还磨面驮谷哩，秋天活重，就得吃的好些哩！再说耕地，耕了多少算多少吧！”这种思想，大家都不同意。张俭说：“宁叫细水长流，不叫清水断了。”打通群众这一思想后，开展了省吃俭用节约运动。
