　　Guerrilla Hero Ma Guang'an
    Ding Man
    The twenty-five-year-old guerrilla hero Ma Guang'an has been a member of the militia for six years. He fought the Japanese during the War of Resistance and was wounded once. He was born a poor peasant and received 31 mu of land after the land reform. This February, when Liu Deng's army crossed over to Hebei, the situation in the seventh district of Yunju became tense. The cadres left the area, but Ma Guang'an, a militiaman, persisted in his hometown with a double-barreled gun. At that time, someone tried to lure him into surrendering to the enemy and offered him an official position, but he sternly refused. Later, that bad element never dared to meet with Ma Guang'an again. Ma Guang'an was firm, and he was promoted to deputy squad leader of the Northwest District militia.
    Beating a Dog in the Water
    When Liu Deng's army annihilated the 55th Division in Yuncheng, Ma Guang'an's militia squad encountered a small group of enemies trying to break through and escape. They chased after them like tigers, pursuing them for fifteen li to Xia Hai. Because the enemy had better firearms and more men, they managed to escape. Ma Guang'an and his comrades were anxiously resting at the entrance of Xia Hai village when they suddenly heard gunfire from behind. He guessed that this was another group of enemies trying to break through. He directed everyone to hide in the cornfields and occupy two grave mounds, waiting for the enemy to arrive. But the enemy also discovered them and occupied one of the grave mounds. The two sides started fighting. The enemy shouted, "We just won't hand over our guns to you militiamen!" Ma Guang'an and the others charged onto the enemy's grave mound. The enemy had nowhere to hide and surrendered their guns. Ma Guang'an's militia squad captured an enemy company commander and six soldiers, and killed one, obtaining three Czech-style rifles and a telescope. Ma Guang'an's militiamen called this battle "Beating a Dog in the Water."
    Luring a Horse with a "Hard Hook"
    In early August, Ma Guang'an's hometown suddenly changed from a recovered area to a guerrilla zone again. This time, Ma Guang'an persisted in guerrilla warfare not alone, but leading a militia squad, fighting day and night. One day, they were staying in Yinmaji when they suddenly heard that the enemy's 75th Division was coming from the north to the south. Ma Guang'an immediately led his militia squad to cut in from the enemy's side and reach the rear. As the enemy advanced, they crawled forward in the cornfields, tailing the enemy. After arriving at Yinma, the enemy's rear troops rested. Ma Guang'an led his team to move to the side. He was anxiously going forward to inquire about the enemy's situation when an old man ran out of Yinma. He hurriedly went forward to ask, "Where are the enemies resting? How many are there?" "Three people are sitting facing southwest in Shen Yongxiang's shop on the east side of the south road of the cross street, drinking water. The others are drinking in the street." Although Ma Guang'an didn't know this fellow villager, the fellow villager was familiar with the hero Ma Guang'an. "Are there any sentries outside?" Ma Guang'an asked again. "There are sentries at the west gate, south gate, and north gate, but not at the east gate!" Ma Guang'an and his militia squad often walked back and forth in Yinma. His home was only two li southwest of Yinma. He was so familiar with the geography of Yinma that he knew not only Shen's shop, but also the size of the alleys and the height of the walls in Yinma. Hearing that the enemies were in Shen's shop, Ma Guang'an dared not delay. He led two seventeen-year-old young guerrillas, Xiao Chao and Tongsheng, and entered from the north side of Yinma's east gate. Ma Guang'an was quick-handed, quick-eyed, and light-footed. Some of his comrades called him "Flying Legs." He flipped over five walls in a row, jumped over from the backyard, and came to Shen's shop, placing Xiao Chao and Tongsheng to one side. He burst into the back door of the shop. With a glance of his eye he saw only one enemy sitting in the room, his left hand on his gun and his right hand holding a teacup, drinking water. Ma Guang'an jumped up in one stride, aiming at the enemy's chest. The enemy was stunned. He asked in a panic, "Are you the Eighth Route Army?" Ma Guang'an ordered him to raise his hands. The enemy's gun fell to the ground with a clatter. Xiao Chao and Tongsheng also entered the room, picked up the gun, and took the prisoner back to camp first. Ma Guang'an pushed the enemy's bicycle that was parked outside the door, got on the bike, and flew past on the street with a whoosh. The enemies asked in confusion, "What was that for?" When the enemies realized what happened, they chased along the road for one li, but Ma Guang'an had already gone far away. The enemies fired a burst of gunfire in vain and returned in disappointment. This victory was called "Hard Hook" by the militiamen.
    Arresting Bo for Revenge
    During the day, Ma Guang'an's militia squad not only hid in the cornfields, but also paid attention to capturing enemies on the roadside at all times. This day, Ma Guang'an was watching on the roadside when he saw a person coming from the front. Looking closely, it turned out to be his father's friend (his uncle) Hou Baicheng. Ma Guang'an knew that he was a fleeing landlord from Houlou. The last time the enemies came, he turned over grain and land in the village, extorting 5 million yuan in Chiang Kai-shek's currency from the masses, and asked the masses to buy a horse for his son to ride to become a member of the Home-Returning Corps, almost forcing the chairman of the farmers' association to death. This time the enemies came, this guy came back again. Ma Guang'an thought of his sins and hated him deeply. He immediately hid in the cornfields and told his companions, "A member of the Home-Returning Corps is coming up ahead!" When Hou Baicheng came closer, they suddenly jumped out and captured Hou Baicheng. Ma Guang'an asked the militiamen to tie him up. Hou Baicheng recognized that it was his "nephew" Ma Guang'an and immediately greeted him with a smile. When they arrived at the village, many people knew that Ma Guang'an had captured his uncle. His father, uncles, and maternal uncles all came to vouch for him. Ma Guang'an told them about Hou Baicheng's sins and also criticized his father. That night, Hou Baicheng was shot and killed, avenging the masses of Houlou.
    Ma Guang'an led his militia squad, persisted in guerrilla warfare, and protected his own interests and the interests of the masses. They fought fifteen battles in total. Now Ma Guang'an has been selected as a special-class hero of the district.

　　游击英雄马广安
    丁曼
    二十五岁的游击队英雄马广安，参加民兵有六年的历史了，抗战期间打鬼子，曾负过一次伤。他出身是个贫农，土改后分得三十一亩土地。今年二月，刘邓大军过河北去了，郓钜七区情况紧张起来，干部们跳出了地区，唯独民兵马广安单人双枪，在家乡坚持。当时曾有人诱惑他投敌，给他个官当，但被他严厉拒绝，后来那个坏分子再也不敢跟马广安见面了。马广安是坚定的，他被提拔为西北小区的民兵副分队长。
    打落水狗
    刘邓大军在郓城消灭五五师的时候，马广安民兵班碰到了突围逃跑的小股敌人，便猛虎一般追击下去，追了十五里地，追到夏海，因为敌人的火器好人又多，结果放他们跑掉了。马广安和他的同志，都很着急的在夏海村头上休息，突然又听得后边枪响，他估计这又是突围的敌人上来了。他指挥大家隐蔽在青纱帐里，占据着两个坟头，等敌人到来。但敌人也发现了他们，占住一个坟头，双方打起来。敌人说：“就是不把枪交给你民兵！”。马广安等猛的冲到敌人坟头上去了，敌人无存身之地，交枪了。马广安的民兵班，俘虏了敌人一个连长，六个兵，还打死一个，得了三支捷克式步枪，一个望远镜。马广安的民兵们称这次战斗为“打落水狗”。
    引马“硬撇”
    八月初，马广安的家乡由收复区突然又变为游击区，马广安这次坚持游击战，不是一个人了，他带领着一个民兵班，星夜的战斗起来。一天，他们住在引马集，忽听说敌人七十五师从北面向南来了，马广安立即带着他的民兵班从敌人侧面插过去，到了敌人的后尾。敌人前进，他们在青纱帐里爬着也前进，尾随着敌人。到引马后，敌人的后尾部队休息了，马广安带着队伍转移至侧面去，他正急燥的上前打听敌人消息，适时一个老百姓从引马跑出来了，他急忙前去询问“敌人休息在什么地方？有多少人？”“三个人在十字街南路东沈永祥的铺子里，脸朝西南坐着喝水，其他人在大街上喝着。”马广安虽然不认识这个老乡，但老乡却熟悉英雄马广安。“外边有他们的岗没有呢？”马广安又问。“西门、南门、北门都有岗，就是东门没有！”马广安和他的民兵班，经常在引马走来走去，他的家又是在引马西南仅二里地，他对引马地理的熟悉程度，不要说是沈家铺子，就连引马的大小过道、墙头高低他都知道，听说敌人在沈家铺子，马广安不敢怠慢，带领了两个十七岁的小游击队员小朝和同生，从引马东门的北边往里进。马广安的手急眼快脚步轻，他的同志有人称他是“飞毛腿”。他一连翻过了五道墙，从后院子跳过去，来到沈家铺子，把小朝和同生布置在一边。他一步闯进铺子后门，白眼看见屋里坐着只一个敌人，左手扶枪，右手端着茶杯喝水。马广安一个箭步蹦上去，瞄准敌人胸膛，敌人怔住了，他慌张的问：“你是八路军吧？”马广安命令他举起手来，敌人的枪乒的一声，倒在地上。小朝和同生也进来屋子，拿起枪，带着俘虏先回营去了。马广安推起放在门外的敌人的自行车，骑上车子，从大街上飕飕的飞过去。敌人乱问：“那是干啥的？”当敌人发觉后，依着车道追了一里地时，马广安早已走远了。敌人空打了一阵子枪，扫兴而归。这一次胜利，民兵们叫“硬撇”。
    捉伯复仇
    马广安民兵班在白天，不是单纯的隐蔽在青纱帐里，他们还时刻注意在路边上捕捉敌人。这天马广安在路边上看着前边来了一个人，仔细一瞅，原来是他父亲的朋友（他的仁伯父）侯百成。马广安知道他是侯楼的逃亡地主，上一次敌人来，他在村里倒粮、倒地，讹榨群众五百万元蒋票，叫群众给他儿子买马骑上，去当了还乡团，几乎逼死了农会长，这次敌人来了，这个家伙又回来了。马广安想起了他的罪恶，恨极了，马上隐蔽到青沙帐里，告诉他的同伴说：“前边来了一个还乡团！”当侯百成来到了跟前时，他们忽的钻出去，捉住了侯百成。马广安叫民兵把他绑起来。侯百成认识了是他的仁“侄”马广安，立即嘻皮笑脸的说问好。到了村里，好多人都知道马广安捉住了他仁伯。父亲、叔父、舅父都来保，马广安把侯百成的罪恶说给他们听，另外还批评了他父亲。这天夜里，枪毙了侯百成，为侯楼的群众报了仇。
    马广安率领着他的民兵班，坚持了游击战争，保卫了自己的利益，保卫了群众利益，他们前后战斗十五次。现在马广安被选为小区的特等英雄。
