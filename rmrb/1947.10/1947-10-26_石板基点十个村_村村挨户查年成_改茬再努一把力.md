　　Ten Villages as a Base Point in Shiban
  　Check the Harvests Door to Door in Every Village
  　Work Hard Again to Replant
    [Reported from Li Cheng by this newspaper] The ten villages at the Shiban base point in the Fourth District are located in deep mountain gullies, where the climate is one season behind other villages. Coupled with the lack of rain this spring, planting was very late. Most of the crops planted were late crops, which were killed by frost around the 10th of the month. To further mobilize the masses to plant more wheat to make up for the poor harvest, on the 12th, all villages at the base point began a large-scale inspection of the harvest by household, group, and village. Experience concluded that the late crops killed by frost at the base point included 1551.1 mu of millet, of which 462.8 mu yielded no grains, 307.7 mu yielded less than 3 *dou*, 87.5 mu yielded less than 5 *dou*, and 1258.7 mu yielded less than 8 *dou*; 922 mu of late corn, of which 309.4 mu yielded no grains, 382.2 mu yielded less than 3 *dou*, and 230.7 mu yielded less than 5 *dou*; 522.9 mu of cotton, of which 131 mu yielded nothing, 310.3 mu could yield less than 5 *jin*, and 81.6 mu less than 10 *jin*. After inspection and summary, the ten villages at the base point suffered a total reduction of 2466.9 *shi* of grain and 7080 *jin* of cotton. This inspection, discussed and fermented through civil schools, broke everyone's paralysis and further re-acquainted them with the famine. In Shiban, it was calculated that the average per capita reduction was 1.2 *shi*. Hero Chuan Hao said, "The harvest is set, but we can't just sit and wait for death, we must quickly organize to seize the last opportunity to replant wheat!" After discussing how to make up for the shortfall, Shiban originally planned to replant 240 mu of wheat, but has now replanted 410 mu, and plans to replant 550 mu. The ten villages at the base point originally planned to replant 1903.9 mu, but now plan to increase it to 2278.8 mu, more than double the area of the regular crops. As the wheat field area has been expanded, attention has also been paid to combining it with manure accumulation. Cuigou combined the collection of 9000 *dan* of fertilizer, and Pingtou cut wormwood to fertilize 4000 *dan*. The entire base point statistically accumulated 39100 more loads than last year. Currently, the entire base point is organizing all labor and livestock power to rush to replant wheat. (Chong Qi)
    [Reported from Li Cheng by this newspaper] During the tense harvest, cultivation, and wheat replanting, Zhang Lianqin, a liberated peasant in Beiliu Village, reported that his 2.6 *mu* of rice yielded four loads, hardly one *shi*. Some said, "This year's threshing will be done in less than half a day." Revealing the poor harvest this year; it has also frosted, and some late crops are still green spikes, and the corn has just sprouted red tassels, all of which were killed by frost and yielded nothing, affecting the lives of the liberated peasants. The leadership immediately convened a meeting of all Party members and over 120 poor peasants, both men and women, to check this year's harvest. Poor peasant Zhang Lisheng said that he planted 13 *mu* of land, with 5 *mu* of cotton. Although he harvested 30 *jin* of raw cotton, and 4 *mu* of millet, he was able to save one *mu* of seedlings and harvest one *shi* of millet. He replanted 3 *mu* of late corn, which was also killed by frost. The 2 *mu* of early corn yielded a little more than 7 *dou*, averaging less than 20% of a normal harvest. His family of three, with one donkey, needs five *shi* of fine grain to cover the whole year, but this year he can only harvest a total of 1.65 *shi* of fine grain, which is not enough for half a year. Zhang Lianqin's harvest this year is less than 30% of normal. Last year, he was able to have a surplus equivalent to his land. This year, he cannot even achieve one third of his land in surplus. Li Renyu said, "With such a big hole this year, we must replant more wheat to fill it. Experience has proven that if white grass grows out this year, we will definitely harvest more wheat next year. As the saying goes, 'If the ground doesn't freeze, just keep planting.'" After this calculation of the harvest, everyone woke up and fully recognized the disaster. There was a big hole in their lives, and the whole village is now seizing the time to replant wheat and harvest, striving to finish early to engage in sideline occupations.

　　石板基点十个村
  　村村挨户查年成
  　改茬再努一把力
    【本报黎城讯】四区石板基点十个村，是处在深山沟中，气候比他村错一个节令，更兼今春缺雨，下种很迟，大部种的是晚作物，在十号左右，都被霜死。为了更进一步发动群众多种麦，来弥补歉收窟窿，十二号全基点各村展开以户、组、村的大检查年景，经验结全基点被霜死的晚庄稼有谷一千五百五十一亩一分，不见籽没有收成的有四百六十二亩八分，三斗以下的三○七．七亩，五斗以下的八七．五亩，八斗以下一二五八．七亩；晚玉茭九二二亩，寸籽不见的三○九．四亩，三斗以下的三八二．二亩，五斗以下的二三○．七亩；棉花五二二．九亩，没有收成的一三一亩，能收五斤以下的有三一○．三亩，十斤以下的八一．六亩。经检查总结，全基点十个村，统共减少产粮二四六六．九石，棉花七○八○斤。这个检查，通过民校讨论酝酿，才打破了大家的麻痹思想，更进一步重新认识了灾荒。在石板计算每人平均减产一．二石，英雄拴好说：“年景已定下，可不能等死，赶紧组织起来抓最后一把的改麦！”经讨论弥补款收窟窿，石板原计划改麦二四○亩，现已改到四一○亩，计划要改到五五○亩。全基点十个村，原计划改一九○三．九亩，现计划增到二二七八．八亩，超过了正茬的一倍。由于麦地面积扩大，也注意了结合积肥。崔沟结合集肥九○○○担，平头割蒿薰荒四○○○担，全基点统计比去年多积了三九一○○驮。现在全基点正在组织一切劳畜力，突击改麦。（崇岐）
    【本报黎城讯】在紧张的收耕改麦中，北流村翻身农民张连芹反映：他二亩六分直谷割了四驮，难打一石。有的说：“今年打场不用一晌午就打完了。”流露着今年的收成不好；天又下了霜，有些晚作物还是绿穗子，玉茭才抽出红缨来，都霜死了，没有收成，影响着翻身农民的生活。领导上当即召集全体党员及男女贫雇一百二十余人开会，检查今年收成，贫农张里生谈，他种十三亩地，有五亩棉花，虽收三十斤成花，四亩谷，捉住苗一亩，虽收一石，补种三亩晚玉茭也被霜死了，二亩直玉茭能收七斗多，平均不到二成年景。全家三口人，一头毛驴，连负担全年需五石细粮，今年总共只能收细粮一石六斗五升，不够半年食用。张连芹他今年的收成，不足三成，去年达到耕一余一，今年连耕三余一也达不到。李仁玉说：“今年这样大窟窿，想补起来非多改麦不行，经验证明，今年白草莠出来，明年必然多收麦，俗话说：地不冻尽管种。”经过这一计算年成，大家都惊醒了，充分认识了灾情，生活上有了大窟窿，全村都抓紧了改麦收耕，争取早结束好搞副业。（丕义、三锁、飞龙）
