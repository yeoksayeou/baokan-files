　　[Report from our newspaper in Pingshun] Since the autumn harvest began in Chaozhuang on August 16th, despite four consecutive days of rain in between, they have managed to harvest 1,080 mu of millet and strip the corn from 960 mu in just twelve days, in addition to rushing to harvest 150 mu of wheat. Aunt Lü Zhuijin said, "I've lived for sixty years and I don't remember it ever being this fast." The speed of this year's autumn harvest is a common reflection among the masses. Therefore, when model cadre Niu Shu'e proposed autumn plowing, the masses and cadres in the village showed complacency and self-satisfaction. For example, Li Zhangfu suggested, "Our village has more than seventy head of livestock. In previous years, plowing lasted until October 10th. Can we not finish it this year?" Similarly, Zhao Kaicheng said, "Our autumn harvest is so fast. Plowing will be no problem after the harvest. Let's thresh the grain first and then plow!" Everyone felt that there were plenty of livestock, plenty of time (plowing usually lasts until October 10th), and that they were well-organized, so autumn plowing would not be an issue. To overcome complacency and self-satisfaction, Niu Shu'e immediately convened a meeting of all village cadres and hero team leaders to study how much land could actually be plowed given the damp soil this year. Everyone started calculating. Labor hero Guo Anbao said, "In previous years, plowing lasted until October 10th, but there was no leap month. This year, there was a leap month, and the time has already passed. Look, the ground is already frozen two or three fingers deep tonight. Now, there are only twenty days until Lidong [Beginning of Winter]. As the saying goes: 'When Lidong and Xiaoxue [Light Snow] arrive, the ground freezes like iron.' There are only twenty days left for plowing. Each team of livestock has to plow an average of sixty mu to finish." After the calculation, everyone felt that time was tight and they should start immediately. Therefore, the whole village decided that from the 29th day of the eighth lunar month to the 20th day of the ninth lunar month, all the livestock in the village would be uniformly controlled and used by each work exchange team. Plowing would start from the shaded areas to the sunny areas. Livestock would be paired, specialized personnel would be selected to operate the plow, and they would focus solely on autumn plowing. Threshing and other miscellaneous tasks in the fields would be done manually. The whole village also organized an autumn plowing committee to be responsible for inspections. In terms of plowing technology, they were required to plow one furrow for large ridges and two furrows for small ridges, to a depth of four fingers. They established plowing standards and work point recording methods. The people operating the plows also launched a "Four Goods" movement for good plowing, plowing a lot, taking good care of tools, and using livestock sparingly. (Hong Ren, Su Li, Bao Shan, Tian Fu)

　　立冬小雪地冻如铁
  　打破麻痹自满
  　马上动手垡地
    【本报平顺讯】朝庄从八月十六日开始秋收以来，中间经过四天连阴，到现在只十二天时间，除突击赶麦一百五十亩外，还割谷一千零八十亩，撇玉茭九百六十亩，全村现正忙于打场。吕坠金娘说：“我活了六十岁就没有记的这样快。”今年收秋真快是群众普遍反映，所以当模范干部牛书娥提出秋耕时，全村群众干部表现了自满麻痹，如李张富提出：“咱村有七十余头牲口，往年犁地要犁到十月十日，今年还能犁不完！”又如赵开成说：“咱们收秋这样快，等收完犁地不算个事情，咱们打打谷再犁吧！”都觉着牲口多，时间早（要犁到十月十日），都组织起来啦，秋耕不成问题。为克服麻痹自满，牛书娥即召开全村干部英雄小组长会议，研究今年地根湿，到底能犁多少长时间，大家算起帐来。劳动英雄郭安保说：“往年犁到十月十日没有闰月，今年闰了一个月，时间已到了，看今天黑夜地里就冻了二、三指，现在到立冬只二十来天了，俗话说：立冬小雪，地冻如铁。犁地时间只有二十天了，每犋牲口要平均犁六十亩才能犁完。”经计算后，大家都感到时间很紧了，应当马上动手。于是全村议定：从阴历八月二十九日开始，到九月二十日完成，全村牲口由各变工队统一掌握使用，从阴背地开始耕到朝阳地，牲口配犋，选专人掌犁，专门秋耕，打谷和地里杂活使用人力。全村并组织秋耕委员会，负责检查。在犁地技术上，要做到大垄谷一遭一垄，小垄谷一遭二垄，要犁四指深，订出犁地标准及记工办法，掌犁人并为犁好、犁多、爱护工具、惜用牲口，开展了秋耕四大记好运动。（虹仁、苏里、保山、天福）
