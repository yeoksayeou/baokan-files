Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th.

　　In the week from October 1st to 7th, the People's Liberation Army's comprehensive offensive, from beyond the passes to the Yangtze River, developed on a larger scale and with greater intensity, retaking thirty-four county towns. According to incomplete statistics, the enemy's 116th Division of the 53rd Corps, the 64th Brigade of the 15th Division, and the entire 177th Division of miscellaneous troops, as well as other units down to the regimental, battalion, and company level, were annihilated, totaling 30,000 men.

　　The Northeast Democratic Allied Army's autumn offensive unfolded with overwhelming force on the morning of the 1st at 8:00 AM, on both sides of the Changchun-Shenyang section of the Chinese Changchun Railway. On the 1st, the Democratic Allied Army, like a destructive force, retook the towns of Yitong, Xifeng, Faku, Lishu, Jiangmifeng, and Bamiancheng on both sides of the Chinese Changchun Railway within eleven hours, annihilating the 177th Division and the 390th Regiment of the 130th Division of Chiang's army. The Shenyang-Changchun railway was completely exposed. On the 2nd, the Democratic Allied Army completely annihilated the main force of the American-equipped Chiang's army, the 116th Division of the 53rd Corps, between Kaiyuan and Xifeng. On the 3rd, the Democratic Allied Army swiftly swept the 400-li railway line between Changchun and Tieling on the Chinese Changchun Railway, successively capturing important stations such as Gongzhuling, Changtu, Kaiyuan, and Datun, and routed four regiments of the New First Army. Only the isolated city of Siping remained between Changchun and Tieling. At the same time, on the western Liaoning front, our army, following the great victory at the end of last month in annihilating the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division, Provisional 50th Division, and the main force of the 49th Corps, continued to expand its gains, successively capturing important stations such as Baiqibao, Raoyanghe, and Gaotaishan on the Shenyang-Jinzhou section of the Beining Railway, destroying the Juliuhe station near Xinmin. The section of the Beining Railway outside the pass has been cut into pieces, shattering the dream of the bandit chief Chen Cheng to secure the Beining Railway, the blood vessel of the civil war. The Liaonan Democratic Allied Army retook Haicheng in one fell swoop on the 3rd, strangling another blood vessel of Chen Cheng, Yingkou. On the 4th, it retook the important railway junction of Dashiqiao in southern Liaoning. Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, Siping, and Jinzhou are now surrounded on all sides or on three sides by the Democratic Allied Army. The sound of artillery fire has been heard in Changchun, and the Chiang bandit military and government in Northeast China has completely fallen into panic and chaos. "Chen Cheng cried out for troops to be dispatched to reinforce immediately" (Associated Press report). The bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek was trembling in the face of our offensive and hurriedly flew to Beiping on the 4th, reportedly to fly to Shenyang to personally command.

　　Echoing the victorious offensive in the Northeast, the Chen-Su army crossed the Longhai Railway southward from western Shandong on September 26th, traversing the vast areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces. Between Kaifeng and Xuzhou, and between Xuzhou and Suxian, they cut off the major arteries of the Chiang bandit army -- the Longhai Railway and the Jinpu Railway -- and launched a large-scale offensive. In the week up to the 2nd of this month, they crossed the Hui River, Wo River, Fei River, and Da Sha River, successively capturing Weishi, Tongxu, Qixian, Suixian, Xiayi, Zhecheng, Shenqiu, Yanling, Fugou, Hao County, Taihe, Guoyang, and Mengcheng, thirteen cities in total, annihilating more than 5,000 local Chiang bandits. The area spanning hundreds of miles is now free of bandits. This large-scale offensive will greatly advance the great cause of liberating the provinces north of the Yangtze River, echoing the Liu-Deng, Chen-Xie, and central Jiangsu and northern Jiangsu armies. The strategic strongholds of the Chiang bandit's civil war, Xuzhou, Bengbu, and Kaifeng, are all under serious threat. Xuzhou has been placed under martial law, and the bandit chief Bai Chongxi has flown there to deploy city defenses.

　　The Northwest Liberation Army's counter-offensive forces continued to clear the Hu bandit army from the periphery of Yan'an, successively capturing Qinghuabian, Panlong, Ganguyi, Yongping, Long'an, and Yaodianzi, only twenty kilometers from Yan'an. On the 2nd, they retook the county towns of Yanchuan and Yanchang in one fell swoop, completely annihilating parts of the defending 17th Division and 76th Division, killing and capturing over 1,400 men. At the same time, the Liberation Army, which had advanced into the Guanzhong area behind the Chiang Hu bandit army, also captured the Guanfu and Jiuxian strongholds on the Luo (chuan) Yi (chuan) highway. Another unit successively captured many important towns under the jurisdiction of Pu County and Baishui County, opening up new liberated areas in the region, cutting off all escape routes for the Hu bandits in Yan'an, and echoing the Chen-Xie army in southern Shaanxi, threatening Xi'an and Tongguan. The Chiang Hu bandit army was forced to hold onto a corner of Yan'an, in a dilemma of advancing or retreating. The task of clearing the Chiang Hu bandit army from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region is not far off.

　　The Chen-Xie army in western Henan advanced into southern Shaanxi and liberated Shangnan County on the 3rd, threatening Xi'an, causing tremors in Hanzhong. Another unit retook Yiyang and Linruzhen, south of Luoyang, on the 28th of last month. On the 29th, they also severely attacked the 51st Regiment of the 17th Brigade of the 38th Division of the Chiang army and a regiment of the Youth Army, annihilating three and a half companies. On the 2nd, the 64th Brigade of the 15th Division of the Chiang army, which had invaded Xin'an, launched a westward attack, and was completely annihilated by our army in the Tiemen area west of Xin'an. Taking advantage of the victory, they retook Xin'an County. The Liu-Deng army in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui region successively retook Lihuang and Luotian in the latter half of last month, then Jingfu again on the 1st of this month, and Huang'an on the 3rd.

　　Victorious news also frequently came from the eastern and northern China battlefields during the week. The northern Jiangsu Liberation Army retook Yeting City (Yancheng) on the 1st, and western Shandong retook Zhecheng on the 2nd, annihilating most of the 355th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division of the Chiang army. Juye was retaken on the 3rd, and the defending enemy fled south in disarray. In southern Hebei, at dawn on the 5th, the Yongnian county town, which had been besieged for two years, was liberated, killing and capturing over a thousand Han traitors and bandits supported by the Chiang bandits after the Japanese surrender, including Zhong Yulin, Wang Zemin, and Xu Tieying (nicknamed Iron Devil). Under the powerful sway of our northern and southern counter-offensive armies, the 107th Regiment of the 66th Division of the Chiang Yan army, trapped in Qixian County in the Taihang Mountains, launched an anti-civil war uprising on the 22nd of last month, led by Deputy Regiment Commander Cao Yumin, with over 400 officers and soldiers in Gucun, the county.

　　The Jiaodong Liberation Army maneuvered to strike the enemy. Following the blocking battle in Daotou Town, Zhaoyuan, where over 3,500 enemies were annihilated, another 2,000 Chiang army troops of the 9th Division were annihilated in the Dazeshan area between Pingdu and Zhaoyuan from the 24th to the 28th. The 25th and 54th Divisions of the enemy, which had advanced north along the Qingdao-Yantai highway, were also annihilated by over 2,000 each in areas east of Laiyang on the 3rd and west of Fushan on the 30th. The Chiang army fell into the Liberation Army's and militia's encirclement, missing targets everywhere and being beaten everywhere. In the first half of last month alone, over 1,200 were killed by militia landmines. After completing its annihilation tasks in successive blocking battles, our army took the initiative to withdraw from Yantai and maneuvered to transfer to outer lines for combat. Just as the Chiang bandits were touting their "victory" in Jiaodong, the powerful Jiaodong Liberation Army suddenly appeared on the flank of the Chiang army on the Jiaoji Railway on the night of the 29th, forcefully crossing the Yellow River, sweeping the Gaomi-Weixian section of the Jiaoji Railway, successively capturing stations such as @shan station and @shan Village, Zhuyang, Gaoyang, Gaogezhuang, and other strongholds, annihilating 1,500 enemies and controlling 60 li of railway. On the 30th, the 45th Division of the enemy in Gaomi came to reinforce, but was also routed. On the 4th, it retook Yexian County, north of the Jiaoji Railway, completely annihilating the defending enemy. The so-called "offensive" of the Chiang bandits in this corner has suffered huge losses one after another, and will eventually be completely destroyed.

　　我军收复县城三十四座歼灭蒋匪嫡系杂牌三万
    十月一日至七日一周间，从关外到长江，人民解放军的全面攻势以更大规模猛烈发展，连克县城三十四座。据不完全统计，歼敌嫡系五十三军一一六师、十五师六十四旅及杂牌军一七七师全部及其他团营连以下共达三万人。
    东北民主联军秋季大攻势以雷霆万钧之势，于一日晨八时在沈阳、长春间中长路两侧全面展开。一日，民主联军象摧枯拉朽一样，十一小时内，就收复了中长路两侧的伊通、西丰、法库、梨树及江密峰、八面城等城镇，歼灭了蒋军一七七师与一三○师的三九○团，沈（阳）长（春）铁路即完全裸露。二日，民主联军在开原、西丰间完全歼灭了美械蒋军五三军主力一一六师。三日，民主联军疾扫中长路长春至铁岭间四百里铁路线，连克公主岭、昌图、开原及大屯等重要车站，击溃新一军四个团。长（春）铁（岭）间仅余四平一座孤城。同时辽西方面我军，紧接上月底歼敌暂二十二师暂五十师及四十九军主力大捷之后，继续扩张战果，连克北宁线沈（阳）锦（州）段的白旗堡、饶阳河、高台山等重要车站，破击了新民附近的巨流河车站，北宁路关外一段已被割成寸断，粉碎了匪首陈诚确保内战输血管北宁路的迷梦。辽南民主联军则于三日一举收复海城，扼死了陈诚的另一个输血管营口。四日又收复了辽南重要铁路连接点大石桥。刻沈阳、长春、吉林、四平、锦州已被民主联军四面或三面包围，长春市已闻炮声，东北蒋匪军政已完全陷入恐慌与混乱。“陈诚哀叫火速派兵增援”（美联社电），匪首蒋介石已在我攻势面前发抖，于四日慌忙飞往北平，闻将飞沈亲自指挥。
    与东北胜利攻势相辉映，陈粟大军于九月二十六日，自鲁西挥戈跨越陇海路南下，纵横豫皖苏三省广大地区。在开封、徐州间与徐州、宿县间斩断了蒋匪军的大动脉——陇海路和津浦路，展开大规模攻势作战。至本月二日一周间，即渡过了浍河、涡河、淝河、大沙河等纵横川流，连克尉氏、通许、杞县、睢县、夏邑、柘城、沈邱、鄢陵、扶沟、毫县、太和、涡阳、蒙城十三城。歼地方蒋匪五千余。该地区纵横数百里已无匪踪。这一大规模攻势作战，将大大地推进解放长江以北诸省的伟业，与刘邓、陈谢及苏中、苏北我解放大军相呼应。蒋匪内战战略要地徐州、蚌埠、开封均受严重威胁。徐州已戒严，匪首白崇禧已飞往布署城防。
    西北解放军反攻大军继续清扫延安外围胡军，连克青化砭、蟠龙、甘谷驿、永坪、龙安及距延仅二十公里之姚店子，二日又一举收复延川、延长两县城，全歼守敌十七师及七十六师各一部，毙俘其一千四百余名。同时，挺进蒋胡后方大关中的解放军，又克洛（川）宜（川）公路上的关抚与旧县两据点，另部连克蒲县与白水属重镇多处，在该地区开辟了新解放区，遮断了延安胡匪的一切退路，并与陕南陈谢大军呼应，威胁西安与潼关。蒋胡匪军被迫固守延安一隅，进退两难。陕甘宁边区肃清蒋胡匪军为期不远。
    豫西陈谢大军挺进陕南，于三日解放商南县城，威胁西安，汉中为之震动。另部于上月二十八日再克洛阳以南之伊阳与临汝镇。二十九日并痛击蒋军三十八师十七旅之五一团与青年军一个团，先后歼其三个半连。二日侵据新安之蒋军十五师六四旅西犯，被我军全部歼灭于新安以西之铁门地区，并乘胜再克新安县城。鄂豫皖刘邓大军于上月下旬先后再度收复立煌、罗田，本月一日再克经扶，三日收复黄安。
    华东、华北各战场一周间亦捷报频传。苏北解放军于一日再度收复叶挺城（盐城），鲁西于二日收复这城，歼蒋军六八师一一九旅之三五五团大部。三日收复巨野，守敌狼狈南窜。冀南于五日拂晓，解放围困达两年之久的永年县城，毙俘日寇投降后受蒋匪支持之汉奸土匪队伍钟玉林、王泽民、许铁英（外号铁魔头）以下千余人。在我南北线反攻大军声威震慑下，困踞太行祁县之蒋阎军六十六师一○七团，于上月二十二日由副团长曹玉民于该县谷村率领官兵四百余人举行反内战起义。
    胶东我解放军机动击敌，继招远道头镇阻击战歼敌三千五百余人之后，二十四日至二十八日又在平度、招远间大泽山地区续歼蒋军九师二千余人。沿青（岛）烟（台）公路北犯敌二十五师与五四师，亦于三日在莱阳以东、三十日在福山以西地区分别被歼二千余。蒋军陷入解放军及民兵的包围网中，处处扑空，处处挨打，仅上月上半月被民兵地雷炸毙者，即达千二百人。我军于连续阻击战中，完成歼敌任务后，乃主动撤离烟台，机动转移外线作战。正当蒋匪鼓吹其胶东的“胜利”时，强大的胶东解放军于二十九日夜突然出现于蒋军侧背的胶济线上，强渡黄河，横扫胶济铁路高（密）潍（县）段，连克＠山车站及＠山庄、朱阳、高阳、高戈庄等据点，歼敌千五，控制铁路六十里。三十日高密敌四五师出援，亦被击溃。四日又收复胶济路北之掖县县城，全歼守敌。蒋匪在此一隅的所谓“进攻”已连遭巨大损失，最后必将全部覆没。
