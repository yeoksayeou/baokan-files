　　A Collection of Letters to Comrade Soldiers on Southern Expeditions
  　Sending a Fountain Pen, Urging His Wife Not to Lag Behind, Wishing Victory, Hoping Her Husband Will Work with Peace of Mind
    The following are letters from Hao Ruqing, a cadre from Shexian who went south, to his wife Wang Gaizhong, and Wang Gaizhong's reply to her husband Hao Ruqing. The original texts are as follows:
    Comrade Gaizhong:
    It's been more than ten days since we parted. Today I am staying in Nanguan, Yangcheng, and I will soon cross the Yellow River. When I left, you saw me off for several miles, and the parting was a bit unpleasant, but you must know that this is for the revolution. The development of the situation is very rapid, and we will still be together in the near future. I hope you will also prepare to walk and cross the Yellow River in the future! The farther apart we are, the harder we should study. Do not lag behind and strive to be a model. I bought you a fountain pen and mailed it back. Please pick it up at the post office. There are endless things to say, I'll write again later!
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ruqing
    Comrade Ruqing:
    The day after tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival. Our father asked me to write you a letter. I wanted to write after receiving your letter from Yangcheng on August 25th, but because you were about to cross the Yellow River and the location was uncertain, I couldn't send it. The newspaper reported that you had reached Tongguan from Luoyang, and I was really happy. Our parents are both peaceful, my third uncle is also well, the eldest child Maosheng is naughty, but very serious about learning to read, and I have solved the problem of the second child Naisheng's breastfeeding, so I hope you don't worry! I have firmly kept in mind your instructions to me to "work hard, not lag behind, and strive to be a model." I put the fountain pen you sent in my lapel, as if you were right in front of me. I plan to go to the work-study school in the city after the autumn. It is full of family members of cadres who went south. When you have laid the foundation there, I will also learn some skills and go to work south of the Yellow River with you. Everyone is saving money this Mid-Autumn Festival, and our family should also be thrifty, but everyone is very happy. Ruqing: Work with peace of mind. In a word, for the early success of the revolution and the early overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek, the good days are yet to come.

    Red Flower Matches Green Leaf, A Wonderful Couple, Hero Plus Model, Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival with Meritorious Deeds
    Li Shumei, a military dependent from Beiguan, Shexian County, took advantage of the Mid-Autumn Festival to entrust the Taihang Xinhua Daily with a letter to her husband, Comrade He Jinzhu. Comrade He serves as the squad leader in the machine gun company of the 3rd Battalion of the 54th Regiment of the 18th Brigade of the 6th Column. The original letter is as follows:
    Husband Jinzhu:
    I received your letter on July 27th, knowing that you are going to cross the Yellow River to fight Chiang Kai-shek. Some time ago, I heard that our Liu-Deng army has occupied many cities, and I am very happy, thinking that you will make meritorious service again.
    Our family has been allocated 9.5 fen of irrigated land this year, totaling 3.85 mu including the previous land, which is enough for us to cultivate. Sun Zhongfang will cultivate 4 fen of irrigated land on our behalf, and I have also planted 5 fen of corn, which is growing very well. It can produce 2 dan of wheat, and the fertilizer in the fields has also been applied. We have also been allocated six rooms of the landlord Song Tinglu's north and south houses. We have already moved in. I spent 6,000 yuan to buy a cabinet so that we can put clothes. A large scroll is hung on the north wall, with the green "Killing the Enemy and Making Meritorious Service" certificate awarded to you for fighting in Jixian on the left, and my red "Turned Over Model" certificate on the right. The village cadres came and pointed and said: "Red flower matches green leaf, it's really a wonderful couple." I was embarrassed to say anything, but I was really happy in my heart. When you fought in Tangyin, you entrusted Li Shaowen's child, a civilian laborer participating in the war, to bring back 10,000 yuan. I have already deposited it in the village cooperative and received a dividend once, and also gave me 7.5 jin of salt. You told me: "Don't spend the money you worked so hard to earn recklessly." I will not let you down and will plan everything carefully.
    Our little daughter is already three months old, eating well and getting plump, smiling at everyone and not crying. When you defeat Chiang Kai-shek and come back, I guarantee she will be able to walk and call you "Dad." Tomorrow is August 15th, and I am busy harvesting the autumn crops. To save trouble, let's just eat a meal of white noodles! I'm not going to make dumplings. You must take care of your health outside. Having good health is the number one skill for defeating Old Chiang. Some people said to me, "People who go far away always miss their families." I said: "Those who miss their families are useless. My man is definitely not that kind of person."

    Eating Grapes and Enjoying the Moon, Missing Family Members, We Must Win More Battles
    Sun Xifang, a military dependent from Chengdong Beiguan, Shexian County, specially sent a letter to his eldest son Sun Huaiyou, who is in the People's Liberation Army under Liu and Deng, on the occasion of the Mid-Autumn Festival, describing his mood of celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival. The letter said:
    Since you went south across the Yellow River, the family has been looking forward to hearing news of your victories every day. A few days ago, I was in the city, and people on the street were saying one after another: "Commander Liu's (referring to General Liu Bocheng) troops have now reached the Yangtze River and disrupted Chiang Kai-shek's nest!" At that time, I was so happy that I ran home quickly and told the family the news. Everyone's excitement was beyond words. These days, the county, district, and village are all publicizing the great victory of our army's counter-offensive and comforting the military dependents. People say to me when they see me: "You are the family member of the victorious army!" This year's Mid-Autumn Festival, I feel it is better than any year before. Our family's newly built three western houses have recently been completed. Some time ago, the village distributed the fruits of struggle and gave me two satin clothes. Our county's autumn harvest this year is 60%, and it will be harvested soon. Your wife is weaving at home and is more capable this year. She can spin three liang of cotton every day and weave eight chi of cloth every day. Today, the whole family ate dumplings for lunch, and we will eat cakes tonight. The grapes you planted yourself when you were at home are growing very well this year. We picked more than 20 jin. Tonight we will all eat grapes and enjoy the moon, and at the same time, we wish you happiness in the front and win more battles! The family is well, I hope you don't worry.

　　寄南征同志家信一束
  　寄钢笔叫妻子莫落后了祝胜利盼丈夫安心工作
    下面是涉县—南下干部郝如庆南下时给他妻子王改仲以及王改仲给他丈夫郝如庆的回信，原文如下：
    改仲同志：
    离别十多天了，今天我住在阳城南关，很快就要过黄河。我走时，你送了我好几里，分别是有些不快的，但你要知道，这是为了革命。时局的发展是很快的，不久的将来我们仍然会到一块，望你也准备将来走路，过黄河呀！咱俩人越离越远，就应当越努力学习，千万不要落后，争取当模范。我给你买了一支钢笔邮回了，请到邮局拿。话说不完，以后再写吧！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　如庆
    如庆同志：
    后天就是中秋节，咱爹叫我给你写封信。我在收到你八月二十五日从阳城来的信，就想写，因你快过黄河，地点不定，无法寄去。报上登出你们从洛阳到打潼关的消息，我心里真高兴。咱爹娘都平和，三叔病也好了，大孩毛生调皮捣蛋，但识字很认真，二孩乃生的吃奶问题，我已经生法解决了，盼你不必挂念！你嘱咐我“努力学习，不要落后，争取模范”，我是牢牢记在心里了。你邮来的钢笔，我插在衣襟上，就象你在跟前一样。我计划秋后就去城内工读学校学习，那里都是南下干部家属，等你在那里打下了基础，我也学下本领，一同到黄河南工作。今年中秋，大家都在节约，咱家也要俭省，但大家都很高兴。如庆：你安心工作吧，一句话，我们为了革命早日成功，早日打倒蒋介石，好的日子，还在后面。

    红花配绿叶一对好两口英雄加模范立功贺中秋
    涉县北关军属李舒梅，借在中秋佳节，托太行新华日报转她丈夫贺金柱同志一信。贺同志在六纵队十八旅五十四团三营机枪连任班长。原信如下：
    金柱丈夫：
    七月二十七收到你的信，知道你要过黄河打蒋介石，前些时听说咱们刘邓大军占了好多城池，俺很高兴，想你又要立功啦。
    咱家今年翻身分的九分五水地，连以前一共三亩八分五，够咱种了，孙中方给代耕四分水地，我自己还种了五分玉茭，长得很好。能打石二麦，地里的粪也都送完了。咱又分了地主宋廷禄南北房六间。现在已经搬进去了。俺花了六千块钱，买了一个柜，好叫放衣裳，北房墙上挂了一付大中堂，左边贴的是你打汲县赏给你的杀敌立功绿颜色奖状，右边贴的是我翻身模范的红色奖状，村干部来指着说：“红花配绿叶，可是一对好两口”。俺不好意思说啥，可是心里实在高兴，打汤阴时，你托参战民夫李少文的孩子，捎回一万块钱，我已入到村合作社，分了一次红，还给了七斤半盐，你嘱咐我说：苦心赚下的钱，不要胡花，俺是辜负不了你这好心的，总要打算周周到到哩。
    咱小闺女已三个月啦，吃得胖顿顿哩，见人就给笑，也不好哭，等你打败蒋介石回来，管保会走会叫爹了。明天就是八月十五，俺正忙着收秋，为了省事，就吃它一顿白面条吧！不准备包饺子吃啦，你在外可要保重些身体，有了好身手，才是打老蒋的头号本事哩，有些人和俺说，走远了总要想家的，我说：想家的那号人，才是没出息的，俺男人先不是那号人。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　妻李舒梅
    吃葡萄赏月亮怀念家人要多打胜仗
    涉县城北关军属孙西方，于中秋佳节，特给其在刘邓所部人民解放军中的长子孙怀有，遥寄书信，述说其欢度中秋的心情。信中说：
    自你们过黄河南下以后，家里人每天在盼望听到你们打胜仗的消息，前几天，我在城里，街上人们纷纷的说：“刘师长（指刘伯承将军）的队伍现在打到长江边上，把蒋介石的老窝打乱了！”那时我真高兴极啦，赶紧跑回家里，把消息告诉家人，大家高兴的那股劲，可就说不来呀。这两天，县里、区上、村里，都在宣传咱们军队反攻大胜利，慰问军属。人们见了我就说：“你是胜利军的家属”！今年的中秋节，我觉得比那年都好，咱家新修的三间西房，最近完工啦，前些时候，村上分斗争果实，给我分了两件缎衣服。咱县今年秋景有六成，马上就要收割。你女人在家闹纺织，今年越能干啦，纺花每天能纺三两，织布每天能织八尺。今天晌午全家都吃的是饺子，晚上还要吃饼，你在家时亲手栽的葡萄，今年长的很好，摘了二十多斤，今晚俺们都要吃葡萄赏月，同时，也祝你在前方快乐，多打胜仗！家人都好，望你不要挂念。
