　　Increase Production to Support the Great Counter-Offensive
　　Various Regions Intensify Efforts to Eliminate Wasteland and Plant Wheat
　　[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive Report] Under the call to increase production and plant wheat to support the great counter-offensive, many places are vigorously eliminating wasteland. In Changping Village, the Second District of Gaoping, 103 men, women, and children organized themselves to eliminate 123 mu of cultivated wasteland in five days and plan to urgently tackle 24 mu of cemetery land. Women in Xiyao Village reclaimed more than ten mu of wasteland in two or three days and are now preparing to plant a large amount of wheat. The entire Fourth District eliminated more than 1,000 mu of both cultivated and uncultivated wasteland in two days. The disaster situation is severe in eleven counties including Yu and Tai in the Second Sub-district of Taihang. In the areas bordering Yu, Tai, and Qi, there are large areas of uninhabited zones, leaving behind a large amount of wasteland. The entire district has a total of 430,000 mu of cultivated wasteland. After a thorough rain in mid-August, the entire district launched a crash program to eliminate wasteland, having already eliminated 55,000 mu. They are continuing the crash program, preparing to rush to plant wheat to compensate for the poor harvest. Forty villages in the Fifth District of Xingtai have reclaimed 2,200 mu of wasteland. In Shipotou Village, they worked day and night, reclaiming 90 mu in one day. In the Attached Urban District of Lingchuan, cadres and party members took the lead, with villages challenging each other and groups competing, reclaiming more than 4,000 mu of wasteland in ten days. In Qi County, Southern Hebei, due to consecutive years of disaster and a lack of labor and livestock, there is a lot of wasteland. The government recently instructed that those who rent wasteland will not have to pay land rent or burdens for three years, and the masses in various villages are seizing the opportunity to launch a crash program. In Malan First Village, there are 15 qing of wasteland, and more than 10 qing have been reclaimed by the beginning of September. The county party committee called on cadres in various districts to specifically lead the elimination of wasteland to ensure that it is completed before autumn, without delaying wheat planting. In Mubao Village, Jize, there are more than 300 mu of wasteland. After the leadership issued measures such as no burdens for wasteland elimination for three years, everyone said: "This is feasible, and it doesn't require anything. With a little effort, we can harvest wheat for the New Year. Our village has more than 300 laborers, and each laborer can take care of 1.5 mu, so let's leave nothing behind." So everyone rushed to occupy the land as early as possible, reclaiming 175 mu in one day.

  　各地加紧灭荒种麦
    【本报综合讯】在增产种麦支援大反攻的号召下，不少地方都正大力消灭荒地。高平二区长平村组织全村男女老幼一百零三人，五天消灭熟荒一百二十三亩，还要突击二十四亩坟地。西瑶村妇女两三天开荒十余亩，现正准备大量种麦。四区全区两天时间消灭了生熟荒一千余亩。太行二分区榆、太等十一县灾情严重，榆、太、祁边沿地区，还有大片的无人区，遗留下大量荒地，全区共有熟荒四十三万亩，八月中旬全区透雨后，即突击灭荒，已消灭五万五千亩，现仍继续突击，准备赶种麦子，以补助歉收。邢台五区四十个村已开荒两千二百亩。石坡头村黑夜找白天开，全村一天开了九十亩。陵川附城区干部党员带头，村与村挑战，组与组比赛，十天里开荒四千余亩。冀南企之县，由于连年灾荒，劳畜力缺乏，荒地甚多。政府最近指示租种荒地三年不出地租不出负担，各村群众更抓紧突击。马兰一村有荒地十五顷，九月初已开完十顷多，七区已开完三十三顷。县委号召各区干部，具体领导灭荒，保证秋前开完，不误种麦。鸡泽慕堡村共有荒地三百多亩，领导上发出灭荒三年不出负担等办法后，大家都说：“这个事可行，又不要啥，费点劲过年就能收麦子，咱村三百多个劳力，一个劳力一．五亩，就给他个一点不剩。”于是大家便争先恐后的尽早占地，一天内开了一百七十五亩。
