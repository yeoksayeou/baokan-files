Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to United Press and Associated Press dispatches from the 3rd and 4th: Strikes in Shanghai are continuing to expand. "Disturbances" occurred in two major department stores in Shanghai on the 4th, and the other five major department stores are also brewing a general strike. Seven employees of Wing On Company and China National Goods Company have been arrested by Chiang's police. Millions of leaflets are scattered throughout the streets of Shanghai, protesting the Kuomintang's arrest of striking workers. United Press stated: "Other workers are also preparing to protest the strike," and pointed out that "low wages and high cost of living will further trigger a general strike in Shanghai." Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Headquarters has announced that it will send the Youth Army's 202nd Division into the city "when necessary" "to strengthen the police force," proving that the situation is more serious than Chiang Kai-shek's authorities expected. The police have implemented "guards" at the entrances of various department stores and continue to arrest workers on a large scale. Twelve shop assistants have been arrested in the past two days. On the 3rd, striking workers of the French Concession Tramway Company had an armed conflict with the police. That morning, a car forcibly escorted by a group of police officers attempted to drive out of the depot. Enraged striking masses immediately blocked the way. Fifty Chiang Kai-shek armed police officers then frantically beat unarmed workers with rifle butts and made wholesale arrests. Ninety-six workers were arrested on the spot, and twelve were injured. Chiang Kai-shek's "representatives" of the Social Affairs Bureau openly and shamelessly led the police to forcibly occupy the French Electricity Workers' Union office. Chiang Kai-shek's police and guards, with bayonets fixed on their rifles, were on alert in the vicinity of the company and the union office, as if facing a formidable enemy. All traffic in the area was completely cut off for a time, and the situation was tense.

　　上海七大百货公司
  　正酝酿总罢工
  　蒋警滥施逮捕秩序大乱
    【新华社陕北六日电】据合众社美联社三日及四日消息：沪市罢工正继续扩展。上海两大百货公司四日发生“骚动”，同时其他五大百货公司亦正酝酿总罢工。永安公司与中国国货公司职工七人，已为蒋警察所逮捕，沪市街道到处散有千万传单，抗议国民党对罢工工人之逮捕。合众社称：“其他的工人也在准备抗议罢工”，并指出“低微的工资与高昂的生活更会引起上海的总罢工。”蒋匪淞沪警备司令部已宣布“必要时”将以青年军第二○二师开入市内，“以加强警察的力量，”证明事态已出乎蒋匪当局意料之外严重。警察已对各百货公司门口实行“警卫”，并继续大肆逮捕工人，两日中又有公司店员十二个人被捕。三日法商电车公司罢工工人曾与警察发生武装冲突。该日晨，有一辆为一群警察强制押送的汽车，企图驶出车场，愤激的罢工群众当即阻住去路，蒋匪武装警察五十人即以枪托疯狂殴打徒手工人，并大肆逮捕，当场即有工人九十六名被捕，并有十二人受伤。蒋匪社会局“代表”竟公然无耻地率领警察乘机强行霸占法电工人工会办事处。蒋匪警察及警卫队均枪上刺刀，在该公司及工会办事处一带警戒，如临大敌，一时形势紧张，该地所有交通全部断绝。
