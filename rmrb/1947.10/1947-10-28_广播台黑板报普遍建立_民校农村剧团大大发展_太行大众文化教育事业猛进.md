[Report from our Taihang correspondent on the 26th] In Taihang, mass cultural and educational construction has undergone land reform, the lives of farmers have improved, and it has been universally developed, and has now become an indispensable part of the lives of rural people. The first is the widespread establishment of mass blackboards and broadcasting. According to statistics from 12 counties (cities), including Lucheng, Lincheng, Heshun, Changzhi, Yushe, Licheng, Gaoyi, Lingchuan, Zanhuang, Yuanshi, Xingtai, and Xingtai City: There are a total of 3,729 administrative villages (streets), with 1,625 broadcasting stations and 3,850 mass blackboards. This equipment has become a powerful weapon for publicizing central tasks and a locomotive for developing rural culture. Each village has also universally established a mass cultural organization—the Propaganda Committee—to unify leadership and organization of this work. The development of this work was first promoted by elementary school teachers and students, who played a bridging role, and then took root among the masses, forming a mass-based self-education. For example, Beiliu in Licheng compiles the central tasks of each season into clappers, ditties, and small flower operas for public announcement and broadcast, regulating and mobilizing the emotions of the masses. Houchi Village in Shexian has three mass blackboards and a mobile small newspaper that is changed every other day or daily. The most common form is the clapper talk because it is easy to remember and spread, the masses love to listen to it, and it can give play to the creative wisdom of the masses. Each street has a correspondence team and a correspondence column. When there is material, it is written out and posted on the correspondence column. Every afternoon, the teachers collect and revise it, and after the Propaganda Committee reviews it, it is posted on the blackboard or sent to the broadcaster for broadcasting. If it cannot be used, it is revised with a red pen and posted on the correspondence column. This plays a great role in improving the culture of the masses. As a result, many outstanding propagandists and mobilizers have emerged. For example, Zhao Songqin from Shuzhang Village in Huguan can compose and sing, and he speaks in a timely manner that everyone loves to listen to. Once, at a meal, everyone asked him to compose a clapper talk about Zhang Gaixiang organizing women's militia. He thought for a moment and immediately sang: "Women's Rescue Chairman Zhang Gaixiang, organizes women to make armed rebellion, twenty young women, join the militia to carry guns. Why do they do this? Defend the good times and beat Old Jiang." He studies very hard. He was originally illiterate, but now he can compose and write by himself. His clapper talks often appear on the village's radio station and blackboard newspaper.

Since the land reform movement, people's schools have also undergone new developments in their methods and content. The old approach of emphasizing education in the form of schools has been broken, and it is better integrated with various movements, forming a meeting hall for cadres and the masses. Through the solution of specific problems, systematic ideological education is carried out; and youth literacy classes and youth study groups are established, thus dividing the labor between the education of the general masses and the cultural education of cadres and youth. According to statistics from 433 administrative villages in Pincheng and Heshun (new district) after the land reform, there are a total of 439 people's schools, with regular enrollment accounting for 42.7% of the total population. This is a great increase compared to before the land reform, and it is mainly based on poor and hired peasants. According to statistics from 1,276 administrative villages in eight counties, including Licheng, there are 1,276 youth literacy classes, with 41,604 participants.

The development of rural theater troupes, where farmers sing and enjoy themselves, is only counted in Lingchuan in the new district, accounting for more than 68% of the number of villages. There are currently 30 professional theater troupes in the entire region, including Qinyang and other counties. In terms of activities, Changzhi has systematically organized roving performances of plays about overthrowing the landlords, which promoted the overthrowing movement. During production and famine relief, the Pingshun and Huguan theater troupes created decentralized and small-scale organizational performances, which played a great role in promoting drought prevention and famine preparation this year. In the transformation of drama, the Taihang Theater Troupe created the Taihang Mountain ditty opera, "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "The Trap," and other plays. The performance techniques have also been significantly improved, and they are welcomed by the masses. They have begun to find new ways to transform old plays. Facts have proved that the masses like new plays that perform their own affairs the most. For example, at the Lucheng cultural activists meeting, everyone said: "The old plays all have feudal tails, we don't want them." At the Shexian Spring Festival entertainment meeting, the masses themselves came forward to review the dramas, and at the Piancheng Mule and Horse Fair, the new and old dramas sang against each other, and 80% of the masses crowded under the stage of the new dramas. These are all good examples.

Before the land reform, there were only three mass education centers in the entire district, but after the land reform, the number increased to 17. According to statistics from Wuxiang and other nine counties, there are 18 drum ballad teams with 236 people. In the work of mass education centers, Wuxiang created a method of uniting and transforming old artists, and a large number of timely creations serving the central tasks emerged. The Changzhi Mass Education Center has won the support of the masses after focusing its work on serving the central tasks. The drum ballad team is a folk propaganda form that the masses love to see and hear. It saves labor and money and can also awaken the awareness of farmers and encourage the fighting spirit of the masses. For example, Yang Baogui Niang, a newly emancipated household in Nantianhe, Changzhi, said after listening to the drum ballad about the story of emancipation: "It tells about the landlord's ruthlessness and the poor people's misery. They eat white flour and meat soup, and we can't even grab a leaf of coarse chaff. It's not fake at all. The year before last, when I asked the owner of this house (referring to the original owner of the building she was assigned) for pumpkin pulp, his eldest daughter-in-law said, 'No, we still have to teach how to rot manure.' This is not wronging them at all."

    广播台黑板报普遍建立
    民校农村剧团大大发展
    太行大众文化教育事业猛进
    【本报太行廿六日电】太行的大众文化教育建设，经过土改运动，农民生活的改善，得到普遍的发展，现已成为农村群众不可缺少的生活内容之一。首先是大众黑板与广播筒的普遍建立。据潞城、临城、和顺、长治、榆社、黎城、高邑、陵川、赞皇、元氏、邢台、邢台市等十二个县（市）的统计：共行政村（街）三千七百二十九个，设有一千六百二十五个广播台；有三千八百五十块大众黑板。这种设备已成为宣传中心工作的有力武器，与开展农村文化的火车头。各村并普遍的建立了，大众文化的机构——宣传委员会，统一领导与组织这一工作。这一工作的开展，首先是小学师生起了桥梁作用，又在群众中生了根，形成群众性的自我教育。如黎城北流，把每个季节的中心工作，编成快板、小调、小花戏等，公布与广播出去，调节与鼓动群众的情绪。涉县后池全村有三个大众黑板，还有一张流动小报，隔日或每天换一次。形式以快板为最多，因为快板顺口易记易传，群众爱听，也能发挥群众的创作智慧。各街设有通讯组，通讯栏，有材料时写出来，贴到通讯栏上，每天下午经教员搜集修改，宣委会审定后，再贴到黑板上，或送交广播员广播；不能用的用红笔修改了，贴在通讯栏上，这样对群众的文化提高，也起很大作用。由此也出现了许多出色的宣传鼓动家。如壶关树掌村的赵松勤，能编会唱，且顺口适时，人人爱听。有一次他在一个饭场上，大家让他编个张改香组织妇女民兵的快板，他想了一下，立即就唱出：“妇救主席张改香，组织妇女闹武装，青年妇女二十名，参加民兵把枪扛。她们为啥这样干，保卫时光打老蒋。”他的学习很努力，原先不识字，现在已能自编自写了，村内的广播台，黑板报经常有他的快板出现。
    土改运动以来，民校在做法与内容上，亦有新的发展。打破了过去强调以学校形式教育的老一套，更好的与各种运动密切结合，形成了干部群众的议事厅。通过具体问题的解决，进行系统的思想教育；并成立青年补习班与青年学习小组等，这样把对一般群众的教育、与对干部、青年着重文化教育，作到了分工。据平定、和顺（新区）两县，四百三十三个行政村土改以后统计：共有民校四百三十九座，经常入学的占总人口百分之四十二点七。比土改前大为增加，而且是以贫雇为主。另据黎城等八县一千二百七十六个行政村的统计：即有一千二百七十六个青补班，参加者达四万一千六百零四人。
    农民自唱自乐的农村剧团，其发展只以新区陵川统计，占村数的百分之六十八以上，全区目前共有沁阳等县职业剧团三十个。在活动上，长治有计划的组织巡回演出翻身剧，推动了翻身运动；生产渡荒中，平顺、壶关剧团创造了分散小型的组织演出，对今年防旱备荒，起了很大的推动作用。在戏剧的改造上，太行剧团创造了太行山小调歌剧，王贵与李香香、圈套等剧，表演技术亦有显著提高，受到群众欢迎，开始摸到改造旧剧的新办法。事实证明，群众最喜欢的也是表演自己事情的新剧。如潞城文娱积极分子会上大家谈出：“旧剧都有封建尾巴，咱不要。”涉县春节文娱会，群众自己起来审查戏剧，以及偏城骡马会上，新旧剧对唱，群众百分之八十拥挤在新剧台下，便是很好的例子。
    民教馆土改前全区仅有三处，土改后增至十七处；鼓书队据武乡等九县统计，共有十八队二百三十六人。民教馆工作，武乡创造了团结与改造旧艺人的方法，出现了大批及时的服务中心工作的创作；长治民教馆把工作重心，放在服务中心工作后，博得群众拥护。鼓书队，更是群众喜见乐闻的民间原有的宣传形式，省工、省钱还能唤起农民的觉悟，鼓励群众的斗争情绪。如长治南天河新翻身户杨保贵娘，听了说翻身故事的鼓书后说：“说得地主狠心肠，穷人真凄惶，人家吃的是白面、肉汤，咱抓不住树叶粗糠，一点也不假。前年我和这个房主（指着她所分到的楼院的原主），要南瓜瓤时，他的大媳妇说：“不行，俺还教沤粪啦”，“这可一点也不冤枉他们。”
