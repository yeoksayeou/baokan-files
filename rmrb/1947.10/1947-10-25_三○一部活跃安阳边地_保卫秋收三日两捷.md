　　Unit 301 Actively Operates on the Borders of Anyang
　　Safeguarding the Autumn Harvest with Two Victories in Three Days
　　[Our Anyang Dispatch] To safeguard the autumn harvest, on the 12th of this month, our Unit 301 ambushed the enemy's 2nd platoon of the 6th company in Xidaxing Village, Anyang Fourth District, annihilating them. We killed or wounded over 50 enemies, captured 17 alive, and seized two light machine guns, twelve Type 38 rifles, one American submachine gun, and over 2,500 rounds of ammunition, creating a brilliant combat ratio of six to one in enemy versus our casualties. Following the successful ambush on the 12th, we then ambushed the enemy again on the 14th in villages such as Dongxi Chaiku and Xinzhuang. Around 7:00 AM, the enemy set out from Duanshao Village in three routes to seize grain. We waited patiently until the enemy entered the ambush circle before launching a fierce assault. The encircled enemy attempted to flee but was met with a head-on blow by our forces. The brave soldiers charged the enemy with bayonets, killing or wounding over 30 on the spot and capturing 13 alive, including a platoon leader. We seized 22 rifles, one eight-sound pistol, and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition.
　　Through the active operations of our Unit 301, with two victories in two battles within three days, the enemy in Zhangde was greatly alarmed. The enemy guarding strongholds were startled several times each night. Coupled with our political offensives on the borders and the active coordination of activities behind enemy lines, the morale of enemy and puppet soldiers and fleeing landlords was further shaken. On the second day of the ambush battle, two enemy soldiers surrendered to us. These victorious battles strongly supported the autumn harvest and autumn planting of the masses on the borders. The masses on the borders demonstrated a high degree of love for the active efforts of our Unit 301 in helping them seize the autumn harvest. (Zhangnan Office, Shi Feng)

　　三○一部活跃安阳边地
  　保卫秋收三日两捷
    【本报安阳讯】为保卫秋收，本月十二号，我三○一部队设伏于安阳四区西大姓村，将敌六连二排歼灭，毙伤敌五十余，活捉十七名，缴轻机枪两挺，三八式步枪十二支，美式冲锋枪一支，子弹二千五百余发，创造了敌我伤亡六与一之比的光辉战斗。于十二日伏击获胜后，接着十四日又设伏于东西柴库、辛庄等村，上午七时许，敌由段邵村分三路出发抢粮，我沉着待敌行至伏击圈内，即发起猛烈的冲锋，被围之敌企图逃跑，又被我迎头痛击，勇士们以刺刀向敌冲锋，当场被我毙伤三十余，生俘排长以下十三名，缴步枪二十二支，八音手枪一支，子弹千余发。
    经我三○一部队积极活动，三日内两战两捷以后，彰德敌人大为恐慌，因守据点敌人一夕数惊，加之我边地政攻，及敌后活动的积极配合，敌伪士兵及逃亡地主的情绪更为震动，伏击战的第二天即有敌兵两名向我投诚。这些胜利的战斗，有力的支援了边地群众的秋收与秋种，边地群众对我三○一部队的积极活动助民抢秋，表现高度热爱。（漳南办事处、石峰）
