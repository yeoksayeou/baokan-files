　　Resolutely Support and Eliminate Concerns
　　Zhao Zhuang in Wucheng Establishes Experience in Poor and Hired Peasant Leadership
　　To establish a leading backbone of poor and hired peasants, it is first necessary to clear away the ideological obstacles and concerns of the hired and poor peasants. In the past, our work stance was not very clear, and we did not take root well. In addition, the leadership only listened to the village cadres' reflections, causing the poor peasants to doubt the leadership. The masses believed that no matter what you said, the district cadres and village cadres were of one mind, and they regarded our mobilization of the hired and poor peasants as a means. Last winter, we mobilized poor peasants to "wash the faces" of village cadres, but because we did not provide support to the end, it resulted in the village cadres retaliating. At this poor peasant conference, everyone complained like this: "Last year you told us to offer opinions, saying it didn't matter if we were wrong, and you said you would stand up for us. But none of the things we suggested were resolved. After you (the work team) left our village, the village cadres were still in charge. They tied up several of us poor peasants, saying we poor people were causing trouble and making things difficult. This year you are coming again to mobilize the poor peasants, and it sounds very nice, but I'm afraid it still won't work. After you leave, the village cadres will still retaliate!" This passage fully exposes the thoughts of the poor peasants. It is not that they are unwilling to rise up, nor that they cannot see what is happening, but that they are afraid to raise their heads because they fear they cannot. This is because the leadership in the past did not deeply listen to the opinions of the broad masses of poor peasants, but only listened to the nonsense of a few cadres, even regarding the hired and poor peasants as "not active," "backward," and "stubborn," losing their class stance, which has created a great obstacle to today's mobilization of the hired and poor. In response to these concerns of the poor peasants, we put down our airs, went deep into the broad masses of poor peasants to patiently mobilize them, listened to their voices, boldly believed in them, did what we said, and did what we were told to do. We humbly admitted our past mistakes to the masses, expressed our future attitude, and were determined to provide support to the end. After such a short period of work, the hired and poor peasants began to believe and approach us from their initial suspicion and immobility. When they saw that the leadership was really standing up for them, they spoke their minds. The unanimous opinion of the poor peasants was: "The cadres don't do things for us." They demanded immediate transformation the next day, and we did it without hesitation according to the scheduled time, 100% fulfilling the opinions of the poor peasant小组. When they saw that things were really being done this time, they became bold, active, and moved.
　　Another problem in establishing hired and poor peasant leadership is to boldly break out of the circle, let the poor peasants examine the cadres, and promptly educate and criticize the cadres who are hindering the mobilization of the hired and poor. From the experience in this village, we feel that the old cadres have a strong desire for leadership. They are unwilling to hand over power to the poor peasants, and they are not reconciled to the fact that honest hired and poor peasants are in power. When this village had just begun to deploy the liaison of hired and poor peasant小组, it encountered obstruction from the old cadres. They openly rose up to suppress the activities of the poor peasants, called for martial law and sentries at night, controlled the mutual liaison of poor peasants, and organized and wooed the masses to confront the hired and poor peasant小组, and used the militia to attack and threaten the activists of the poor peasant小组. At this time, the old cadres must be controlled and not allowed to move arbitrarily, so that the poor peasant小组 can boldly examine them, the cadres of landlord and rich peasant backgrounds must be purged, and those who are divorced from the masses must be made to reflect carefully. Good cadres should be educated not to be discouraged, and in the future, they must be united with the poor peasants and honestly serve the poor peasants. If everyone supports you, you can still be a cadre. The militia's guns must be unconditionally handed over to the poor peasant小组 for management. In this way, the poor peasant小组 can do things without any concerns.

　　坚决撑腰打破顾虑
  　武城赵庄树立贫雇领导经验
    树立贫雇领导骨干，首先要扫清雇贫农思想上的障碍与顾虑。过去我们的工作立场不很明确，扎根又没扎好，再加上领导单纯听取村干反映，造成了贫农对领导上的怀疑，群众认为不管你们怎样说，反正区干和村干是一心，把我们发动雇贫看成是手段。去冬发动贫农给村干洗脸，由于没有撑腰到底，结果反而造成村干报复。在这次贫农大会上，大家这样的诉说着：“去年你们叫俺提意见，说提错了也不要紧，还说给作主，后来提的那些事一个也没有给解决，等您（坐村干部）离开俺村还是村干当家作主，把俺贫农捆起来了好几个，还说什么穷人捣乱，给弄过不去，今年你们又来发动贫农，说的倒怪好听，怕还是办不到，等你们走了还得叫村干打击吧！”从这一段话里充分暴露了贫农的思想，他们并不是不愿起来，也不是看不出事来，而是他们想抬头怕抬不起来。这是过去领导上不深入倾听广大贫农意见，只片面听取几个干部胡说，甚至把贫雇看成“不积极”“落后”“顽固”，失掉了阶级立场，而造成今天发动雇贫的很大障碍。针对着贫农这些顾虑，我们放下了架子，深入到广大的贫农中去耐心发动，听取他们的呼声，大胆的相信他们，说怎样就怎样，说干啥就干啥，叫那时候去作就那时候去作，我们虚心的向群众承认了过去错误，表明了今后态度，坚决撑腰到底，经过这样短短一段工作，雇贫才由对我们怀疑不动而开始相信与靠拢，当他们看到领导上真给他作主了，才说出了真心话，贫农一致的意见是：“干部不给俺们办事。”要求第二天就改造，我们就毫不犹疑的按照规定的时间去作了，百分之百的实现了贫农小组的意见。他们见到这回真给办事哩，就大胆了，积极了，动起来了。
    树立雇贫领导的另一个问题，就是大胆的跳出圈子，让贫农去审查干部，及时给阻碍发动雇贫的干部以教育和批评。从这村的体验中感到过去的旧干部有浓厚的领导欲，他们不愿意把权交还贫农，他们对忠厚雇贫掌权是不甘心的。这村在刚刚布置串连雇贫小组时，就遇到了旧干部的阻挠，他们公开的起来镇压贫农活动，晚上号召戒严站岗，控制贫农互相串连，并组织拉拢群众和雇贫小组对抗，掌握民兵打击威胁贫农小组的积极分子。这时要将旧干部控制起来，不准其任意活动，使贫农小组大胆的审查他们，地主富农成份的干部清洗出去，脱离群众的要他好好反省。好的教育他不要灰心，今后要给贫农一气，老老实实为贫农服务，如果大家拥护你还能当干部。民兵的枪支要无条件的交给贫农小组管理。这样以来，贫农小组就毫无顾虑的干起来了。
