Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Moscow Dispatch: Ye. Zhukov recently wrote an article in Pravda commenting on Byrnes' book "Speaking Frankly," stating that "the author of the book himself declares that Byrnes is an unscrupulous warmonger." "Byrnes' policy, which has always served American monopoly capitalists, is clear: it is anti-peace, anti-cooperation between great powers, disregards all diplomacy, indulges his anti-Soviet sentiments, and urges the United States to take aggressive actions that will inevitably lead to war. The main purpose of Byrnes' plan is to openly invade the Soviet Union. In this regard, Byrnes has developed a very popular 'ideal' among American reactionaries, namely, to turn the United Nations, which guarantees security, into a docile tool of American imperialism." Zhukov pointed out: "Byrnes is in a state of fury, and the reason for his fury is that the Soviet Union, in order to safeguard world peace and its own interests, has implemented its independent policy and refused to accept resolutions that contradict the mission of establishing a stable and democratic peace. Byrnes cannot say this, and he is still deluded by the ridiculous fantasy that the post-war world can be established under the command of American hegemony. Byrnes cannot conceal his distress because the American imperialist bloc, with atomic weapons as its 'diplomatic backing,' has not intimidated the Soviet Union. Byrnes, this narrow-minded reactionary, does not understand the significant changes that have taken place in World War II and dares to make hasty judgments on international politics." Zhukov continued: "After the publication of Byrnes' book, foreign newspapers immediately raised sharp criticisms, believing that it was the most representative call for war. We can say that Byrnes' publication of this book has only achieved one definite result, and that is that he has become the subject of conversation, talking about him as a bankrupt and disgraced politician, an instigator of a new war."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: New York Dispatch: The arrogant rhetoric of former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes regarding the use of force against the Soviet Union has aroused strong righteous condemnation among UN representatives and democratic figures in the United States. In his new book "Speaking Frankly," Byrnes proposed that "when all other means have failed, the United States should use armed force and atomic bombs to drive the Soviet army out of Germany." Ukrainian chief representative Manuilsky powerfully pointed out in a speech to the UN Political and Security Committee on the 18th: "The United Nations cannot remain silent in the face of Byrnes' clamor." According to a United Press report on the 16th, a UN representative known for his outspokenness suggested when commenting on Byrnes' proposal that "Byrnes should be sentenced to seven years in prison." Polish representative Katz-Suchy said: "This book will help Europeans understand the true direction of the policies being adopted by the United States." Another representative said: "Byrnes' proposal cannot be considered helpful to the achievement of understanding between the West and the East." Former U.S. Vice President Wallace also issued a statement opposing Byrnes' absurd remarks, saying: "The reason why newspapers make exaggerated reports lies in this, the main viewpoints of the Democratic and Republican parties lie in this, and what I completely disagree with today also lies in this."

　　贝纳斯叫嚣新战争
  　世界舆论痛予呵斥
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】莫斯科讯：叶·朱可夫顷于真理报撰文，评贝纳斯“实言”一书称：“该书作者自己宣布，贝纳斯是一个肆无忌惮的战争贩子”，一向为美国独占资本家服务的“贝纳斯的政策，是明白的，那就是反和平、反大国的合作，置一切外交于不顾，放纵他的反苏情绪，催促美国采取最后必然招致战争的侵略行为。贝纳斯计划的主要目的，即是公然侵略苏联。在这点上，贝纳斯发展了美国反动分子中十分流行的‘理想’，即把保证安全的联合国变为美帝国主义的顺从工具。”朱可夫指出：“贝纳斯是陷于激怒中，他激怒的原因是因为苏联为维护世界和平与自身利益，执行了她独立的政策，拒绝接受与建立稳定的民主和平使命相矛盾的决议。贝纳斯不能说出这一点，他还为可笑的幻想所迷，以为战后世界可以在美国霸主指挥下建立。贝纳斯无法遮盖他的苦恼，因为美国帝国主义集团以原子武器为‘外交后盾’并没有吓倒苏联。贝纳斯这个心地狭小的反动分子，不了解二次大战所起的重大变化，就敢草率地对国际政治轻下判断。”朱可夫继称：“贝纳斯此书问世后，国外报纸立即引起尖锐批评，认为这是最有代表性的战争号召，我们可以说贝纳斯出版这本书只获得一个确定的后果，那就是他成为谈话的材料，谈论他是一个破产的下台政客，新战争挑拨者。”
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】纽约讯：美前国务卿贝纳斯最近所发出之对苏使用武力的狂妄口语，在联大代表及美国内民主人士中激起了强烈的正义抨击。贝氏在其新书“实言”一书中提议在所谓“一切办法均告无效时，美国即以武装与原子弹将苏军逐出德国”。乌克兰首席代表曼努伊尔斯基十八日在联大政治安全小组会演说时有力地指出：“联合国对于贝纳斯之叫嚣，不能默然置之。”据合众社十六日报导，联大一位以直言驰名的代表在评论贝氏建议时主张“处贝纳斯以七年监禁”。波兰代表卡托苏基说：“该书将帮助欧人了解美国所真正采取的政策方向。”另一代表说：“贝纳斯的建议，不能认为有助于西方与东方的达到了解。”美前副总统华莱士亦发表声明，反对贝氏之荒谬言论，并称：“报纸作夸张性报导之原因在于此，民主与共和两党之主要观点在于此，我今日所完全不能同意者亦在于此。”
