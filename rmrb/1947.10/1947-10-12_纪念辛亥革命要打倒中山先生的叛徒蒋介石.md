Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th—Comrade Wu Yuzhang, member of the Tongmenghui and member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, published an article on the 36th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution entitled "To Commemorate the Xinhai Revolution, Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, the Traitor to Mr. Sun Yat-sen." The full text is as follows:

　　Commemorating the 36th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution amidst the victorious sounds of the large-scale counter-offensive of our People's Liberation Army has special significance. I would like to take this opportunity to talk to my fellow countrymen about the history of the Chinese revolution in the past and the current state of the Chinese revolution.

　　Before the Xinhai Revolution, the dark corruption and incompetence of the Manchu Qing autocratic government caused widespread suffering. Cessions of territory, indemnities, and loss of sovereignty had ruined the country. At that time, patriots rose up in revolution to save the country and the nation from peril. In 1905, I joined the Tongmenghui led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and fought for the goals of "expelling the Tartars, restoring China, establishing a republic, and equalizing land ownership," hoping to realize a new China with national independence, civil liberties, and people's livelihood. After more than ten uprisings, the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, finally overthrew the Manchu Qing government, established the Republic of China, and ended China's thousands of years of autocratic rule, leaving a glorious page in Chinese history.

　　Unfortunately, due to the weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie, the fruits of the Xinhai Revolution were stolen by the feudal warlord Yuan Shikai, who was supported by imperialism. After the campaign against Yuan Shikai and the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese Communist Party was truly able to shoulder the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, opening up a new path for the Chinese revolution. At the same time, due to the success of the Russian October Revolution and the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, Mr. Sun Yat-sen recognized that the Chinese revolution should "take Russia as a teacher" and absorb new blood to transform the Kuomintang. He was determined to cooperate with the Communist Party and accepted the Communist Party's proposal to reorganize the Kuomintang in 1924, proposing the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, which enriched the content of the Three Principles of the People.

　　After the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the face of the Chinese revolution was refreshed. After suppressing the reactionary forces in Guangdong and consolidating the revolutionary base, the Northern Expedition was launched in 1926, overthrowing the Northern Warlords such as Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang, occupying the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins, and giving imperialism a serious blow, shocking the world and advancing the Chinese revolution a big step forward. Just as the revolution was developing vigorously, Chiang Kai-shek, a rogue from the Shanghai Stock Exchange who had infiltrated the Kuomintang organization, betrayed the revolution, surrendered to the warlords, colluded with imperialism, launched a coup in Shanghai, and established a counter-revolutionary government in Nanjing. He destroyed the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, arresting and massacring Communists and other democrats and workers and peasants everywhere, and killing Communists particularly severely. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, the Communists who were not killed "crawled up from the ground, wiped the blood from their bodies, and buried the bodies of their comrades, and they continued to fight." Although the August 1st Nanchang Uprising failed, it formed the people's army—the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. After 1928, the Red Army took Jinggang Mountain on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi as its base, and the Red Armies in many other provinces also established bases in the border areas, leading the peasants to carry out land revolution. Supported by German and Japanese imperialism, the bandit Chiang launched a counter-communist and anti-people civil war, mobilized a million troops, and carried out five "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, which lasted for nearly ten years, resulting in the invasion of Japanese imperialism and the occupation of the four northeastern provinces. But when the Japanese army attacked Shenyang, Chiang Kai-shek announced "non-resistance." At the same time, in the areas occupied by the people's army, he carried out cruel "encirclement and suppression" and signed the "Tanggu Agreement" with Japanese imperialism. Subsequently, when North China was in critical condition, Chiang Kai-shek sang "Sino-Japanese friendship" and "economic cooperation," while brutally suppressing the surging "December 9th" student movement to save the country, promulgating the so-called "Emergency Law for Maintaining Public Order and Punishing Crimes," and signing the "He-Umezu Agreement" with Japanese imperialism again. The Japanese invaders advanced from the Northeast to North China, penetrating deeper and deeper, and the country was in extreme danger. At this time, our party, in order to save the nation from peril, issued the "August 1st Declaration," calling on the people of the whole country to unite and form a national united front to resist the barbarous Japanese invaders. However, Chiang Kai-shek remained unrepentant and continued the civil war. After the "Double Twelfth" Xi'an Incident in 1936, he was forced to resist Japan under the pressure of the people of the whole country. However, after the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, he still did not give up his conspiracy of compromise. First, Wang Jingwei defected to the enemy, while Chiang Kai-shek announced at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang: "Resist to the end to restore the state before the Lugouqiao Incident." This is confirmation that he did not want the Northeast. During the Southern Anhui Incident in 1941, the Kuomintang army cooperated with the enemy and puppets to encircle and attack our New Fourth Army. Since then, the enemy and puppets successively sent ＠Junroku, Tao Xisheng, Wu Kaixian, and others to secretly negotiate peace. Our party, on the other hand, repeatedly called on the people during the War of Resistance: "Persist in resistance, oppose compromise; persist in unity, oppose division; persist in progress, oppose regression." "Fight to the Yalu River!" Holding the banner of the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war firmly, and relying on the people's strength behind enemy lines to persist in resisting Japan, recovering lost territory, opening up vast liberated areas, forcing the enemy into points and lines, resisting 60% of the Japanese army and 80% of the puppet army, the liberated areas have eliminated the forces of imperialism, there is no national oppression, allowing ethnic minorities to govern themselves, eliminating feudal remnants, carrying out land reform, establishing democratic political power, liberating peasants, developing production, so that everyone has work, food, clothing, no unemployment and begging, workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers each get their place, unite as one; truly implementing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, inheriting and carrying forward Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit. Chiang Kai-shek, on the other hand, retreated from Northeast China to North China and all the way to Guizhou. He not only passively resisted Japan and actively opposed communism, but also implemented personal dictatorship, suppressed the democratic movement, massacred small ethnic groups and patriotic youth; let the US military run rampant everywhere, raping and killing; disregarding the people's lives, requisitioning food and borrowing, leaving ten houses out of nine empty, conscripting soldiers and laborers, causing turmoil; secret agents ran rampant, plundering and stealing, party members were corrupt and officials greedy, and the world was dark; plunging the people into misery. Compared with the liberated areas, it is truly a heaven and a hell.

　　After the victory of the War of Resistance, in order to give the people who had fought for eight years a chance to recuperate, our party sought compromises and advocated peaceful nation-building and the realization of democracy. Our party chairman, Comrade Mao Zedong, flew to Chongqing to negotiate, and the "Double Tenth Agreement" was reached. A solemn Political Consultative Conference was convened as stipulated in the agreement, and the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, which were supported by the people of the whole country, were established; however, Chiang Kai-shek played a trick of having one face to the public and another in secret, and was determined to be counter-revolutionary to the end. Disregarding the opposition of the people of the whole country, he abandoned the Double Tenth Agreement, the Four Promises, the Ceasefire Agreement, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, launched a nationwide civil war, convened a pseudo-National Assembly, formulated a pseudo-constitution, and united the feudal remnant group, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the traitorous Lion Dog Youth Party to carry out the so-called "reorganized government," while signing the traitorous Sino-US Commercial Treaty, colluding with the US military to station troops in China, selling out territory, airspace, and territorial waters, borrowing heavily from the US, buying a lot of military supplies, and opening up trade with Japan, at the expense of catering to American warmongers, resurrecting Japanese warlords, and causing Chinese national industry and commerce to collapse. On the one hand, he expelled the CCP delegation, occupied Yan'an, suppressed young students who wanted peace and food, massacred peaceful people in Shanghai, Taiwan and other places, closed newspapers advocating peace and democracy, arrested and assassinated democrats and journalists, and used Japanese war criminal Okamura Neiji to command the civil war, issued a "general mobilization order," violated the promise to stop conscription, and re-conscripted grain, requisitioned, borrowed, and conscripted soldiers, increased taxes, and issued banknotes indiscriminately, causing prices to soar tens of thousands of times, making it impossible for people to live. All of this trampled on and sold out the Republic of China created by the Xinhai Revolution, exceeding the crimes of the Manchu Qing by thousands of times. But the traitor Chiang Kai-shek opened his mouth about "Premier" and closed his mouth about the "Three Principles of the People," calling the term "revolution" very loudly, but what he did completely betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen, insulted the Three Principles of the People, and tainted the revolution. He united feudal remnants and traitors domestically, and colluded with US imperialism abroad to jointly advocate war, attempting to use China as the battlefield for the Third World War, using Chinese land as the testing ground for atomic bombs, and making the Chinese people meaningless victims. Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and harmful behavior is truly a sinner of the Chinese nation unprecedented in history.

　　Now that our People's Liberation Army is launching a large-scale counter-offensive from Sub-north in the east to Shaanxi in the west, to the Yangtze River in the south, and to the Northeast in the north, the revolution has entered a new stage. The people who have turned over want to move forward, and the people who have not turned over want to turn over. We have the support of millions of people, we dare to win, and we must win.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's doomsday has arrived, and the day to settle the accounts of Chiang Kai-shek's crimes has arrived. Can the old comrades of our Tongmenghui and the true followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen sit idly by and watch the revolutionary martyrs of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the Republic of China founded by us be reduced to colonies of US imperialism? Can all patriotic compatriots who want peace, democracy, food, survival, and self-rescue and rescue others endure Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and harmful atrocities? On the day of commemorating the Xinhai Revolution, let us wake up, unite as one, inherit the glorious tradition of the Xinhai Revolution, overthrow the traitorous and harmful Chiang Kai-shek, and drive the American imperialist warmongers out of China! Strive to build a new China that is independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous! Finally, I loudly appeal: Arise! Comrades! Compatriots! The light of the new era has shone on us, advance bravely!

　　纪念辛亥革命要打倒中山先生的叛徒蒋介石
    吴玉章
    【新华社陕北十日电】同盟会会员、中共中央委员吴玉章同志，于辛亥革命三十六周年发表“纪念辛亥革命要打倒中山先生的叛徒蒋介石”一文，全文如下：
    正当我人民解放军大举反攻的胜利声中，来纪念辛亥革命三十六周年，显得有特殊的意义。我愿借此机会向我全国同胞谈一谈中国过去革命的历史和中国革命的现状。
    在辛亥革命以前，由于满清专制政府的黑暗腐败与无能，闹得民不聊生，割地赔款，丧权辱国，国家已败坏得不成样子了。当时志士仁人纷起革命，以挽救国家民族的危亡。我于一九○五年参加了中山先生所领导的同盟会，为当时所提出的“驱除鞑虏，恢复中华，建立民国，平均地权”的目标而奋斗，希望实现一个民族独立、民权自由与民生幸福的新中国。经过十多次的起义，终于在一九一一年十月十日武昌起义胜利推翻了满清政府，建立了中华民国，结束了中国几千年来的专制制度，在中国历史上留下了光辉灿烂的一页。
    可惜由于中国资产阶级的软弱性，辛亥革命的果实被帝国主义所扶持的封建军阀袁世凯所窃取了。经过讨袁和“五四运动”到中国共产党的产生，才真正地肩负起了反帝反封建的大旗，给中国革命开辟了一条新的道路。同时由于俄国十月革命的成功及中国共产党的成立，中山先生认定了：中国革命应“以俄为师”，及吸收新血液以改造国民党。他决心与共产党合作，并接受共产党的建议，于一九二四年改组国民党，提出联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策，丰富了三民主义的内容。
    国共两党合作以后，中国革命的面貌为之一新，削平了广东反动势力，巩固了革命根据地之后，在一九二六年进行北伐战争，打倒了吴佩孚、孙传芳等北洋军阀，占领了长江流域及黄河流域，并给帝国主义以严重打击，震惊了全世界，使中国革命向前进了一大步。正当革命在蓬勃发展的时候，钻入国民党组织内来的上海交易所出身的流氓蒋介石，却背叛了革命，投降军阀，勾结帝国主义，在上海举行政变，并在南京成立反革命的政府，破坏了国共合作，到处逮捕屠杀共产党人及其他民主分子和工农群众，杀害共产党人特别厉害。未被杀死的共产党人，如毛泽东同志所说：“从地下爬起来，擦干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸体，他们又继续战斗了。”“八·一”南昌起义虽然失败了，但是组成了人民的军队——工农红军。一九二八年以后，红军取得了湘、赣边的井岗山作为根据地，其他许多省份的红军，也在边境地方建立了根据地，领导农民进行土地革命。蒋贼在德日帝国主义的扶持下，发动反共反人民的内战，动员了百万军队，进行了五次“围剿”，打了将近几乎十年，结果招来了日本帝国主义的侵略，占领了东北四省。而当日军进攻沈阳的时候，蒋介石却宣布“不抵抗主义”。但同时在人民军队占领的地方，则进行残酷的“围剿”，并与日本帝国主义订“塘沽协定”。随后当华北十分危急的时候，蒋介石却高唱“中日亲善”、“经济合作”，而对高涨的“一二·九”学生救亡运动，则实行残酷的镇压，颁布所谓“维持治安紧急治罪法”，并与日本帝国主义再订“何梅协定”。日寇的侵略由东北而华北，节节深入，国家危殆极了。这时候我党为了挽救民族国家的危亡，发表了“八一宣言”，号召全国人民团结起来，结成民族统一战线，一致抵抗蛮横的日寇。但是蒋贼仍怙恶不悛，继续内战。经过一九三六年“双十二”的西安事变，他才在全国人民压力之下，不得不被迫抗日。可是，“七七”抗战以后，他仍未放弃妥协的阴谋。首先是汪精卫投敌，而蒋介石却在国民党五中全会上宣布：“抗战到底，为恢复芦沟桥事变以前的状态。”这是他不要东北的确证。一九四一年皖南事变时，国民党军配合敌伪围攻我新四军，此后敌伪陆续派＠俊六、陶希圣、吴开先等秘密谈和。而我党则在抗战时间再三号召国人：“坚持抗战，反对妥协；坚持团结，反对分裂；坚持进步，反对倒退。”“打到鸭绿江边去！”把抗日民族革命战争的大旗紧紧掌握着，并在敌后依靠人民力量坚持抗日，收复了失地，开辟了广大的解放区，把敌人逼在点线之中，抵抗了百分之六十的日军与百分之八十的伪军，解放区已肃清了帝国主义的势力，没有民族压迫，让少数民族自治，消除封建残余，实行土地改革，建立民主政权，解放农民，发展生产事业，使人人有工作、有饭吃、有衣穿，没有失业与乞食的现象，工农商学兵各得其所，团结一致；真正实行了中山先生的三民主义，承继并发扬了中山先生的革命精神。而蒋介石却从东北华北一直退到贵州，他不仅消极抗战、积极反共，而且实行个人独裁，压制民主运动，屠杀弱小民族及爱国青年；让美军到处横行，奸淫虐杀；不顾人民生活，征实、征借，十室九空，抓丁、抓夫，鸡犬不宁；特务横行，抢收窃夺，党横官贪，暗无天日；使人民陷于水火之中。和解放区相比，真是一个天堂一个地狱。
    抗战胜利之后，我党为使抗战八年的人民得有一个休养生息的机会，委屈求全，主张和平建国，实现民主，我党主席毛泽东同志曾飞重庆谈判，成立了“双十协定”，照协定所规定召开了庄严的政治协商会议，成立了为全国人民所拥护的政协五项决议；但是蒋介石却玩弄了表面一套里面又一套的把戏，一心一意要反革命到底。他不顾全国人民的反对，毁弃双十协定、四项诺言、停战协定、政协决议，发动全国大内战，召开伪国大，制定伪宪法，联合封建余孽集团民社党、汉奸狮子狗青年党进行所谓“改组政府”，一面签订卖国的中美商约，勾结美国军队驻扎中国，出卖领土、领空、领海，大借美债，大买军火，开放对日贸易，不惜迎合美国战争贩子，使日寇军阀死而复生，使中国民族工商业倒闭。一面驱逐中共代表团，占领延安，镇压要和平要饭吃的青年学生，残杀上海、台湾等地和平人民，封闭主张和平民主的报纸，逮捕暗杀民主人士及新闻记者，起用日寇战犯冈村宁次指挥内战，下“总动员令”，违背停征诺言，重新征粮、征实、征借、征丁，加重捐税，滥发纸币，使物价高涨数万倍，使人民无法生活下去。这一切的一切，把辛亥革命所创造的中华民国践踏和出卖，比满清的罪恶行为还要超过千万倍。但卖国贼蒋介石却开口“总理”闭口“三民主义”，把“革命”一名词叫得很响，而他所做所为，完全背叛了中山先生，侮辱了三民主义，沾污了革命。他在国内联合封建余孽汉奸，在国外勾结美帝国主义共同鼓吹战争，企图以中国为第三次世界大战之战场，使中国土地作原子弹的试验场，中国人民作无谓的牺牲品。蒋贼这样的卖国殃民，真是千古未有的中华民族的罪人。
    现当我人民解放军东起苏北、西至陕西、南抵长江、北至东北，各路大军深入蒋匪统治区大举反攻的时候，革命已进入了新的阶段，翻了身的人要前进，没有翻身的人要翻身，我们有千千万万的人民拥护，我们敢于胜利，我们一定要胜利。
    蒋贼的末日已经到来了，清算蒋贼罪行的日子已经到来了。我同盟会的老同志、中山先生的真正信徒们，能坐视中山先生革命诸先烈和我们手创的中华民国沦为美帝国主义的殖民地吗？全国要和平、要民主、要饭吃、要生存及一切爱国的同胞们，能忍受蒋贼卖国殃民的暴行而不自救救人吗？在纪念辛亥革命的今天，大家惊醒起来，一致团结起来，继承辛亥革命的光荣传统，打倒卖国殃民的蒋介石，驱逐美国帝国主义战争贩子出中国！为建立独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国而奋斗！最后我大声疾呼：起来！同志们！同胞们！新时代的光明已照耀着咱们，勇敢前进啊！
