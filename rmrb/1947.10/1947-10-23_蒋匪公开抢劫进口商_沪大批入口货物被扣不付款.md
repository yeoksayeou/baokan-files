Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Shanghai Dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's Executive Yuan passed the "Measures for Handling Goods Arriving at Port and Shipped with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Without Permits" on the 14th, greatly increasing extortion from import merchants. The so-called measures stipulate that all goods worth 40 million US dollars stored in Shanghai Customs warehouses with self-provided foreign exchange without permission, and goods shipped from abroad before August 16th, will be purchased uniformly by the Chiang Kai-shek government without payment. The payment will be made in so-called "special foreign currency deposit certificates" issued by the Central Bank, paid in six installments over three years. After the acquisition, the Chiang Kai-shek government will still sell at market prices to make money. It also stipulates that if the importer is unwilling to comply with these measures, they can only "reship the goods back to the port of export" and "must not transfer them to other places such as Hong Kong or Vietnam." After the publication of this reactionary measure, import merchants were extremely saddened and indignant, stating that under the dual pressure of high interest rates (currently Shanghai's interest rate is already 18 to 20 percent per week) and rising prices, paying back in three years would be tantamount to condemning them to death. According to a United Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 17th, Shanghai importers affected by this decision are planning to protest this reactionary measure by the Chiang Kai-shek government. Hong Kong officials called this move by the Chiang Kai-shek government "legal robbery." The agency also quoted well-informed sources estimating that this measure would likely lead to more rampant smuggling.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: United Press, Shanghai, 7th: The number of unemployed people in Shanghai is increasing daily. According to an announcement by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Social Affairs Bureau on the 6th, the number of directly unemployed people in Shanghai has increased from 150,000 to 300,000 in the past three months. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Social Affairs Bureau admitted that most of the 150,000 recently unemployed people were laid off from industries such as machinery, shipbuilding, public utilities, silk weaving, knitting, and sewing. This further shows the deep crisis of national industry and commerce in the Chiang Kai-shek area under the heavy blows of American and Japanese goods and Chiang Kai-shek bandit bureaucrat-capitalism.

　　蒋匪公开抢劫进口商
  　沪大批入口货物被扣不付款
    【新华社陕北二十日电】上海消息：蒋匪政府行政院十四日通过：“无许可证自备外汇到埠及起运货物处理办法”，对进口商人大大施展之勒索。想办法规定：凡自备外汇未经许可之已存放上海海关仓库中之价值四千万美元之货物，及八月十六日以前已由国外起运在途之货物，均由蒋政府统购而不付款，货款由中央银行发行所谓“特种外币存单”，在三年中分六期付齐。收购后按市价仍由蒋政府出售赚钱。并规定进口商若不愿遵照此办法办理，只有“将货物重运回出口港口”，“不得转运往其他如香港越南等地”。此项反动办法公布后，进口商人均极悲痛与愤恨，表示在高额利率（目前上海率利已为每周百分之十八至二十）与物价日高的双重压迫下，三年还钱无异致彼等于死地。据合众社香港十七日电称：受此一决定所影响的上海进口商，正计划抗议蒋政府此项反动措施，香港官员对蒋政府此举称之为“合法的抢劫”。该社并引消息灵通人士之估计：此项办法势将促使走私更为猖獗。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】合众社沪七日讯：沪市失业人数日益增加。据蒋匪社会局六日宣布，过去三月内，沪市直接失业人数已由十五万人增至三十万人。同时蒋匪社会局承认最近失业的十五万人中，大部分系由机器、造船、公用事业、丝织、针织、及缝纫诸工业中被解雇者，此事进一步显示出今日蒋区民族工商业在美、日商品及蒋匪官僚资本重重打击下之深重危机。
