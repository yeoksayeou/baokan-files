　　Ji County Huaimuwei Prepares to Plant Wheat
  　Organizes Temporary Large-Scale Mutual Aid
    [Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 3rd] Huaimuwei in the Fifth District of Ji County, after raising tasks, discussing difficulties, and explaining methods, organized temporary large-scale mutual aid to prepare for a concentrated wheat planting effort. The village has over 160 households and more than 34 hectares of land. There wasn't a single mutual aid group. In previous years, they planted around 20 hectares of wheat. This year, the situation is good, and they should plant even more. However, the entire village only has 80 cattle and 25 donkeys. There are 183 able-bodied male laborers. A third of the households don't have livestock. If the total wheat planting area of the village is divided equally among the livestock, each animal would have to plow and plant 20 mu of wheat. Adding to this the tasks of delivering manure, hauling crops, the need for a quick harvest, and the desire to plant more wheat, it is very difficult to achieve. After propaganda and mobilization, adopting a voluntary combination and large-scale organization method, 90 percent of the village households participated in the temporary large-scale mutual aid for autumn harvest and wheat planting, forming a total of 24 groups of various sizes. Each group discussed rules, set plans, and determined methods for equivalent exchange of labor between people and animals. The 25 groups collectively cultivated 3,327 mu of land, planning to plant 1,868 mu of wheat, with 975 mu of early crop and 893 mu of late crop. Currently, the early crop land has been completely plowed. During the plowing period, they actively harvested the late seedlings, preparing to launch a concentrated wheat planting effort. According to the masses' experience, each animal can plow and harrow three mu of land per day when both plowing and harrowing are done. Manure is delivered by people pushing carts instead of using animals, saving animal labor for plowing land and planting wheat early. Poor peasants and households without livestock reflected: "This year, wheat can be planted on time." The poor peasant Yu Hege said: "This method is really good. Our land also has livestock to plow! In the past, we had to beg, and we didn't know when we would be able to plant! Mutual aid is so much better!" The organization was achieved only after the following difficult processes: (1) Raising tasks, explaining difficulties, and discussing methods. First, mobilize for autumn harvest and wheat planting, using concrete calculations to explain the benefits of planting wheat, proposing "one wheat crop is worth three autumn harvests," and "two seasons are always better than one." Use practical examples to illustrate the current difficulties and the necessity of mutual aid. This generally persuaded the village cadres. Then, convene mass meetings and small group meetings, livestock owner meetings, gradually deepening and mobilizing; (2) During the deliberation, go deep into the masses, listen to their attitudes, concerns, and opinions regarding mutual aid, and then patiently explain these thoughts. For example, those with cattle were afraid of suffering losses from mutual aid with those without cattle. It was explained that labor exchange is not the same as buying labor with money; for those who feared trouble and restrictions, it was explained that human and animal exchange is only temporary for autumn harvest and wheat planting; (3) After the deliberation matured, convene mass meetings in different streets, re-mobilize, emphasize voluntarism, and avoid any coercion. The number of people combining should be small, because too many people lead to too many opinions, and it is difficult to adjust labor and calculate work exchange. Village cadres and militia members should voluntarily form groups. Individual village cadres and militia members who attempted to speculate and were evenly distributed to each group for cultivation were promptly corrected. Eight households of military families, seven of whom had labor, were also integrated into various groups. The one household without labor was cultivated by a group on their behalf; (4) District cadres and village cadres went to the groups separately to assist in setting plans and rules. Everything was decided by the masses. Equivalent exchange should be greatly promoted, explaining: "Clarity beforehand avoids disputes later." Let the masses discuss the rules and plans themselves. Each group does not have to strive for uniformity. They can exchange information, learn from each other, and learn from each other's strengths through the group leader joint meeting.

　　冀县槐木围准备种麦
  　组织临时大互助
    【本报冀南三日电】冀县五区槐木围，经过提任务、说困难、讲办法，组织临时大互助，准备突击种麦。该村共一百六十多户，卅四顷多地，没一个互助组，往常年种麦二十顷左右，今年垧好，更应多种，但全村只有牛八十头、驴二十五头，男整劳力一百八十三个，三分之一户数没有牲口，按全村种麦面积与牲口平均分配，每个牲口须犁、耩麦子二十亩，再加送粪拉庄稼、收秋要快、种麦要多是很难办到的，经过宣传动员采用自愿结合，大规模的组织方式，全村百分之九十户参加了秋收种麦的临时大互助，共大小组二十四个。各组讨论规矩，订出计划，和人畜换工等价办法，二十五组共耕地三三二七亩，计划种麦一八六八亩，早茬九七五亩、晚茬八九三亩，现早茬地已全部犁完，并在犁地期间积极来收割晚苗，准备展开种麦突击。群众经验连犁带耙，每天每犋牲口，能犁耙三亩地，送粪不用牲口，用人推，剩下牛工犁地早种麦。贫农和没牲口户反映：“今年种麦可应时了。”贫农于合芸说：“这个办法真好，咱的地也有牲口犁啦！过去张口下气，不知晚到什么时候才种上！互助起来，一来一往，有多好！”此次组织起来，经过以下艰苦过程：（一）提任务、讲困难、讲办法，首先进行秋收种麦动员，用具体计算说明种麦好处，提出一麦顶三秋，两季总比一季强，并用实际例子说明当前困难，非互助起来不行，普遍打通了村干思想，再召开群众会、小组会，牲口户会，逐步深入，逐步发动；（二）酝酿中深入群众，倾听对互助态度、顾虑及意见后，针对这些思想耐心进行解释，如对有牛户怕与没牛户互助吃亏，说明工换工不是钱买工；对怕麻烦受限制的人，说明人畜互换，只是临时的秋收种麦；（三）酝酿成熟后，分街开群众会，重作动员，强调自愿，不加任何强迫，结合时人要少，人多嘴杂，劳动力不好调整，也不好计工换工。村干民兵一律自愿结组，个别村干民兵企图投机，平均分到各组让各组代耕，也及时作了纠正，八户军属七户有劳动力的，也结到各组，一户没劳力的，由一组代耕；（四）区干、村干分头到小组，协助订计划订规矩，一切由群众决定，等价交换要大大提倡，说明：“先明后不争，”让群众自己去讨论规矩、计划，各组不必强求统一，可经过组长联席会交换情况、互相学习、取长补短。
