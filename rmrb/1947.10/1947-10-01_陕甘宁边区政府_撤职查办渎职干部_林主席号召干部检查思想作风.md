Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th. In the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government’s movement, led by the CCP Party Committee, to examine ideology and stance, two important responsible cadres found to be negligent in their duties—Wang Shiying, Deputy Director of the Border Region Government Tax Bureau, and Ma Li, Deputy Director of the Border Region Health Department, concurrently serving as the Director of the Border Region Hospital and Principal of the Medical School—have been officially dismissed and are under investigation. Last winter, Wang Shiying was sent to a sub-region of the Border Region Government to participate in land reform but performed his work perfunctorily and carelessly, lacking any spirit of serving the masses. Furthermore, he misappropriated public funds for commercial profit, protected Liang Shidong, the Director of the Longdong Central Tax Bureau, who was guilty of embezzlement and dereliction of duty, and lived an extravagant and wasteful life, misappropriating over three million Border Region currency for his wedding last year. When the Chiang army invaded, he displayed panic and, using the excuse that his work term was over, requested to return to Yan'an. Since taking office, Ma Li has consistently emphasized departmental interests, stubbornly adhered to his own views, disobeyed instructions from superiors, cultivated alliances and attacked cadres, lacked any organizational principles, and allowed students to behave improperly. Moreover, during the war, he left his post without permission, taking his wife with him, privately carried public funds, and squandered them recklessly. In other news, Feng Zhiguo, Deputy Director of the Border Region Bank and Acting Director of the Suide Branch, disregarded his duties and panicked in the face of events during a transfer in mid-September, losing gold and banknotes valued at over 500 million yuan. He is currently under thorough investigation and will be severely punished.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th. The CCP Party Committee of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government convened a mobilization meeting on the 20th for Party member cadres from various departments and the Security Office, Bank, and Trade Company to examine their work ideology and style. At the meeting, Chairman Lin Boqu of the Border Region Government reported on the new situation of the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive and called on all Party member cadres to thoroughly examine their work ideology and style, and coordinate with the examination of policies, in order to improve work efficiency and complete the tasks of supporting the front lines, recovering lost territories, and liberating the Great Northwest. After briefly reviewing past work, Chairman Lin emphasized: "Marxism-Mao Zedong Thought teaches us to serve the people wholeheartedly. We must examine whether we have handled the people's affairs well. In the past, the Finance Department and Trade Company only focused on solving the livelihood problems of cadres detached from production, and did not pay attention to solving the problems of food and clothing for the 1.6 million people in the entire Border Region. We must examine what kind of ideology and stance this represents. In 1943, the Salt Company only accepted Chiang currency and not Border Region currency, which violated the financial policy of maintaining the currency and was, in essence, a capitulationist ideology. Now, all departments should immediately examine whether they have the ideology and stance of the landlord class and whether they have a subjective and bureaucratic work style. Ask yourselves if you are qualified to be students of Mao Zedong." Regarding how to promote the examination movement, Chairman Lin instructed: "We must thoroughly promote democracy, earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism from bottom to top and from top to bottom, and expose thoroughly those degenerate elements who only care about personal plans, fear death, and are greedy and corrupt, such as Feng Zhiguo, Wang Shiying, and Ma Li." It is reported that the Party Committee of the Border Region Government has drafted a specific plan in accordance with Chairman Lin's instructions to effectively promote this movement, and the Secretariat, Department of Civil Affairs, and financial and economic systems of the Border Region Government have already begun the examination movement.

　　陕甘宁边区政府
  　撤职查办渎职干部
  　林主席号召干部检查思想作风
    【新华社西北二十九日电】陕甘宁边府在中共党委领导的查思想查立场运动中，已将两名渎职的重要负责干部边府税务总局副局长王世英及边区卫生署副署长兼边区医院院长及医校校长马荔、明令撤职查办。王世英于去冬被派赴边府分区参加土地改革，工作敷衍塞责，毫无为群众服务的精神，且挪借公款经商营利，包庇陇东中心税局局长梁世动贪污渎职，平日生活铺张浪费，去年结婚即挪用公款三百余万边币。而当蒋军进犯时，则表惊惶失措，借口工作期满，要求返延。马荔自任职以来，一贯强调本位利益，固执己见，违抗上级指示，拉拢和打击干部，毫无组织原则，师生行为不检，且在战争期间携妻擅离职守，私带公款，任意挥霍。另息，边区银行副行长兼代绥德分行行长冯治国，于上月中旬转移途中，漠视职责，临事慌乱，丢失价值券币五万万元以上的黄金和钞票，现正予彻底究查，将从严处分。
    【新华社西北二十九日电】陕甘宁边区政府中共党委于二十日，召开所属各厅及保安处、银行、贸易公司等单位党员干部检查工作思想作风动员大会。会上边府主席林伯渠报告解放军开始大反攻的新形势后，号召全体党员干部彻底检查工作思想和作风，配合检查政策，以达到提高工作效率，完成支援前线，收复失地，解放大西北的任务。林主席于扼要检讨过去的工作后，着重说：“马克斯主义——毛泽东思想教导我们全心全意为人民服务，我们要检查是否把人民的事情办好了。财政厅和贸易公司过去只顾解决脱离生产干部的生活问题，而不重视解决全边区一百六十万人民的吃饭穿衣问题，要检查一下这是什么思想和立场。盐业公司在民国三十二年只收蒋币不要边币，这是违反金融政策维护货币的观点，实质上是投降思想。现在各部门应即检查是否有地主阶级的思想和立场，是否有主观主义、官僚主义的作风，问一问自己够不够资格做毛泽东的学生。”关于如何推进检查运动，林主席指示：“必须彻底发扬民主，认真展开自下而上与自上而下的批评与自我批评，对只顾个人打算，贪生怕死，贪污腐化的蜕化分子如冯治国、王世英、马荔等人，应引起公债，彻底检举出来。”据悉边府党委已依照林主席指示，拟就具体计划，切实推进这一运动，边府秘书处、民政厅及财经系统均已开始检查运动。
