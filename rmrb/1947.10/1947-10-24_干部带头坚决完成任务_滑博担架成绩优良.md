　　【Reported by this newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 22nd】 In Hua County's Sixth District, out of thirty stretcher teams accompanying the army, not a single person deserted in fifty-three days, and they helped the masses with their work everywhere. The main reason was that the district cadres leading the stretcher teams could lead by example, influencing everyone with their exemplary actions. During the battle of Dingtao, they accepted the transportation mission and advanced in the rain. On average, each stretcher team carried three to four wounded soldiers in one night. At the same time, during their daytime rest, they also helped the local masses with their work. For example, when staying in Gaozhuang, Puyang County, Hebei, they hoed 68 mu of land for the masses. When staying in Wangtang, they repaired two houses and built two walls for the masses. When staying in Shilipu, they plastered seventeen mud houses. In particular, the Nanhugu stretcher team saved forty jin of white flour in one month. When staying in Shilipu, they vigorously publicized our victory news and the suffering of the poor to the masses. At that time, they encountered three poor families who had run out of food. After discussion, the whole team distributed the forty jin of white flour to the three poor families, and deeply realized that all poor people are one family. A stretcher-bearer named Lao San from Da Zheng Village volunteered to carry a stretcher and brought a razor. In fifty days, he took turns shaving the heads of 140 stretcher-bearers. Because he knew how to treat children's diseases, the masses in the villages where they stayed came to him for treatment. Comrade Da San from × Village was sick for five or six days while carrying a stretcher. Others asked him to rest, but he resolutely continued to carry it, persisting until the last day, earning everyone's praise. The morale of every stretcher-bearer was very high.
　　
　　【Reported by this newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 22nd】 During the great counter-offensive, Bo County mobilized 1,000 stretcher teams, totaling more than 7,000 people, who enthusiastically supported the front and resolutely completed their tasks, producing a large number of models, and were commended by the County Administrative Committee. After the combat support task was assigned in the county, cadres and masses rushed to participate. Comrade Xie Gou of Xiaolizhuang left for the front after only half a night of being newly married, traveling eighty li to catch up with the main force. When crossing the river, comrades Xie Zhongli and Gao Fangming of the Ninth District pulled boats in the water for fifteen li overnight. Comrade Gao Zhenjiang of the Third Brigade personally carried wounded soldiers across the water, showing great care for the wounded. District Chief Cheng personally pulled civilians across the water, and was very concerned about the civilians' food, lodging, and living conditions. Comrade Cunliang helped the masses with production. Because of the leadership of these model individuals, the stretcher team successfully completed its task and was commended by the County Administrative Committee.

　　干部带头坚决完成任务
  　滑博担架成绩优良
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】滑县六区三十付随军担架，五十三天中，没有一个人逃亡，并到处帮助群众做活。主要原因是由于带担架的区干部能以身作则，处处以模范的行动影响大家。在打定陶时，他们接受了转运任务，冒雨前进，一夜中平均每付担架抬三个至四个伤员，同时他们在白天休息中，还帮助驻地群众作活。如在河北濮县高庄住时，给群众锄地六十八亩。在王堂住给群众修盖房子两间，打了两道墙。在十里铺时，泥房子十七间，特别南户固担架，一个班在一个月内节省四十斤白面。在十里铺住时，向群众大力宣传我们的胜利消息和穷人的苦处，当时即遇着三家断绝口粮的穷人，他们全班商讨后，将四十斤白面分给三家穷人，并深刻认识到天下穷人是一家。大正村担架员名叫老三的，自报奋勇抬担架，并带剃头刀一把，在五十天中轮流给担架剃头一百四十个。因他会看小孩病，住到那村群众纷纷找他看病。×屯村大三同志，抬担架病了五、六天，别人叫他休息，他坚决抬，一直坚持到最后一天，得到大家赞扬，每个担架员的情绪都很高涨。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】大反攻中博平担架一千付七千余人热烈支前，坚决完成任务，涌现大批模范，获得县行政委员会表扬。该县当战勤任务布置下以后，干部群众纷纷踊跃前往。小李庄谢枸同志新婚后仅半夜，即赶行八十里追上大队一样出战勤。在过河时，九区谢中立、高方明等同志，连夜在水中拉船十五里。三大队高振江同志亲自背伤号过水，对伤员爱护备至。程区长亲自拉民夫过水，对民夫的吃宿居住很关心。存良同志帮助群众生产，由于这次模范者的带头，使这次担架队胜利的完成了任务，获得县行政委员会的表扬。
