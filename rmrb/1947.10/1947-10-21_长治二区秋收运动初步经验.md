Preliminary Experiences in the Autumn Harvest Movement in the Second District of Changzhi
    Gao Xi, Sheng Xiu
    On October 10th, the Second District of Changzhi convened a meeting of all district cadres to understand the situation in the early stage of the autumn harvest movement, summarize the previous experiences, and guide the future movement. The autumn harvest in the entire district began in early August (lunar calendar), and basically took off after August 15th, forming a comprehensive movement in the past ten days. According to the situation in the entire district, it can be divided into three types of villages. The first type is villages where the autumn harvest can be completed in one or two days. The development of the movement is based on solving the ideological problems of the masses, with poor and hired peasants as the backbone and role models, and comprehensive organization of labor. In terms of equal value exchange, the method of converting work into labor points is meticulous and fair. Such villages include Tianhe, Sudian, and thirteen other main villages. The second type of village is where more than half of the autumn harvest has been completed, and the entire village is also mobilized, but lacks typical promotion and the equal value exchange is not meticulous enough, and the poor and hired peasants are not the backbone. Such villages include Beicheng, Nancheng, Hetouwangdong, and eighteen other main villages. The third type is villages where the autumn harvest has just begun, although they are also harvesting, but without organization, and no groups in the village. There are problems in leadership, thus showing weakness. Such villages include Langjia and six other main villages. The main experiences in developing the movement are as follows:
    First, solve the ideological obstacles to the movement.
    There are mainly two types of ideological obstacles: one is the idea of waiting for things to calm down. For example, Cao Xinglong in Tianhe said: "The autumn harvest is not urgent. We harvest the millet and then move the corn, harvest one thing and then harvest another, and after harvesting, we plow the land. What's the rush?" Jin Gou said: Who doesn't know how to harvest in autumn? Why do we need to have meetings and just chase after it! Yu Bao said: In autumn, the crops are ten percent crops and eight percent harvest. Sima, the political director, said: Every year we chase after the autumn harvest. People in Chouren Group in Sudian said: Let's wait for a sunny day! Some people in Gaohe said: Let's wait for a sunny day to dry them before harvesting! It's not too late." To solve this idea, let the masses discuss whether the crops are really ripe, and what to do if they are ripe. If it's cloudy, a northwest wind is needed to make it sunny. The ripened millet will be lost after a strong northwest wind. After breaking through the masses' thinking, they acted. The other is the idea that villages with many gardens value vegetable gardens and despise dry land. For example, Wang Heze Group in Sudian said: "If you miss the vegetable garden, you'll have a hard time all year round." Let everyone discuss: Is it okay to only grow vegetables and not grow field crops? And let everyone recall the fact that in disaster years, they couldn't harvest grain, and only growing vegetables couldn't survive the famine, and put forward the slogan: "Despise field crops and value gardens, only eating vegetables can't fill your stomach," and solved this problem.
    Second, the role of typical promotion: The leading role of typical groups and figures in each village promoted the entire village. For example, Cao Linshui in Tianhe first formulated a plan and meticulous methods for calculating work points and equal value exchange in his group, and organized all male, female, full, semi, and auxiliary laborers, and timely rewards for activists, which promoted other groups. When Sudian proposed organizing women and children to go to the fields, some people looked down on women and children, thinking they were useless. Some people even said: How much can women and children do? As long as men smoke one less bag of tobacco, they can make up for what they do. At the meeting of cadres, group leaders, and activists, Bi Eryun introduced the experience of organizing women and children in his group. When his group was harvesting millet, eight male full laborers, six women, and two children participated. The entire group of 33 mu of millet was harvested in one day. The women also harvested very quickly. Eryun's wife harvested 2.4 mu in one day, and Qiu Guo's wife harvested 2.2 mu in one day, and said: You say women are useless, I say women and children work together on the ground, and organizing them is like having a machine. This broke through everyone's thought of belittling women and put forward the slogan: "Women and children work together, can top half a man's hand." The next day, there were 556 women, 144 children, and 128 old men in the village who went to the fields. The whole village of Gu Xian also acted under the leadership of Jia Ju and the mutual aid group, and launched a campaign to rush harvest at night.
    Third, poor and hired peasants lead, cultivate and use activists:
    In this period of movement, it has been proven that the village led by poor and hired peasants (including village cadres and group leaders) has a good movement. For example, in Tianhe, nine of the eleven mutual aid group leaders are poor peasants, and one is a middle peasant, so the movement is developing quickly and well. In Sudian, among the 41 mutual aid group leaders, there are ten middle peasants, and the mutual aid groups led by middle peasants are not energetic.
    In Feng Village, two rich peasants served as mutual aid group leaders, always afraid of struggle, and were not active. In one group, a poor peasant was the group leader, and the rest were middle peasants. The group was controlled by the middle peasants, and the poor peasant could not play a backbone role, so it was a "mutual aid in name only." After solving ideological problems, they voluntarily combined again, replaced the two rich peasant group leaders, and also replaced six middle peasant group leaders, and the movement began to develop.
    At the same time, good villages also cultivated and used a large number of activists. For example, Cao Linshui had ten activists in his second team, and each group in the village had activists. There were also many activists in each street in Sudian who took the lead. There were no activists in Gaohe Hetou, so the movement was relatively sluggish.
    Fourth, organize a large number of semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers.
    In organizing semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers, the main thing is to organize women and children. In terms of methods, we must first overcome two ideas: one is the idea of belittling women and children. In Tianhe, there is such a slogan: "If you want to win the battle, children and wives must go together." The other is that women themselves look down on themselves and think that labor is shameful. At the same time, the family profit-sharing method is used to improve their enthusiasm. For example, when women in the third team of Cao Linshui's team in Tianhe began to organize to participate in the autumn harvest, they asked: Last year, you said there would be wage profit-sharing, where is it? They first stipulated the family profit-sharing method, and the work points earned every day were kept by her personally, which improved their enthusiasm. The Bi Eryun family implemented the profit-sharing method. When his sister-in-law was stripping corn, her arms were swollen. Eryun's mother said, "You should rest at home!" She said, "The Eighth Route Army fought to the end, and I will strip corn to the end." Linshui's family profit-sharing method is: Linshui's wife and brother's wife, one cooks and one goes to the field. The work points earned in the field are divided into four-six with the family. The family gets six, and four is for herself. The shares given to the cook and to the person who works in the fields are then divided in half. Another is the leading role of activists. For example, Linshui's mother is over sixty years old and is very active in participating in labor. As soon as it is dawn, she calls people to go to the fields, influencing others to be active. Eryun's wife and Qiu Guo's wife in the Eryun group led all nine women in the group. Furthermore, in terms of calculating work points and equal value exchange, it must be meticulous and work must be counted by the piece. For example, in Chouren Group in Sudian, it was stipulated that harvesting one millet cob would cost five yuan. Women with bound feet ran to the ground and harvested more. When stripping corn, because no equal value exchange method was stipulated, the women in the field just looked up at the sky and wanted to go back early. In the Yang Heze group in Tianhe, it was stipulated that cutting one millet cob would cost five yuan. Bao Hua and Qiaolian, who were both nine years old, also had to participate in cutting millet, cutting six millet cobs early in the morning. Furthermore, women can also be allowed to participate in mutual aid meetings to improve their status. The Eryun group often participated. At the beginning, the Yang Heze group was not motivated. After a meeting to rectify the situation, the women also participated in the meeting, and the women also became active.
    Fifth, carry out competitions, commend models, and reward in a timely manner.
    All villages use loudspeakers, and broadcast almost every night. In addition to broadcasting the main model typical figures, they also broadcast the model typicals of each street and group in a timely manner. For example, in addition to regularly introducing and commending the Bi Eryun group in Sudian, other groups were also commended in a timely manner. For example, the method of using labor by the Erzao group in the West Street was praised. When harvesting millet, young male laborers went to distant lands, and young women, old men, and children went to lands closer by. Women with bound feet who could not walk and some older women cooked closer by. Of the 22 households in the entire group, all but four or five older women went to the ground, and this was also quickly commended, so everyone's enthusiasm was very high. When Sudian broadcasts, they also match it with musical instruments, playing a tune first to attract the attention of the masses before speaking.
    Competitions were carried out between villages and streets. Tianhe also made two red flags, and North and South Tianhe strived to win the red flag.
    At the same time, on the individual level, rewards were also used. After Cao Linshui Brigade calculated the work accounts every night, the best activists of the day were proposed and rewarded with work points. The source of the work points was calculated based on the labor done in a day, and the remainder that each person should get, such as one cent and two li, the remaining two li was given as a reward. By rewarding every day in this way, everyone's enthusiasm was even greater. Both Bi Eryun and Jia Ju in Gu Xian's groups took out some money from sideline production to buy some towels as prizes for the group at the end of the summary.

　　长治二区秋收运动初步经验
    高熙·生秀
    长治二区为了了解秋收运动前段情况，总结前段经验，指导今后运动，十月十日召集全体区干部开会研究，全区秋收于八月初十日开始，基本上从八月十五日以后大搞起来，十天来已形成全面性的运动。按全区情况说来，可分做三种类型村，第一种是秋收在一二日就可以结束。运动的开展是在解决群众思想问题，以贫雇骨干典型带头，全面组织了劳力。在等价上，折工计工方法细密公道。这样的村有天河苏店等十三个主村。第二种村是秋收已收了一半以上，全村也都轰起来，但缺乏典型推动与等价不够细密，贫雇没为骨干，这样的村有北呈南呈、河头王董等十八个主村，第三种是秋收刚在开始，虽然也在收，但没组织，在村没小组。领导上存在着问题，因此表现无力。这样的村有郎家等六个主村，运动开展起来的主要经验，有这样几点：
    第一是解决运动的思想阻碍。
    在思想阻碍上主要又有这样两种：一种是等待消停思想，如天河曹兴隆说：“秋收就不是急哩，是割完谷搬玉茭，收完一样再收一样，收完以后再犁地，这就和抢什么一样。”金狗说：谁还不知道收秋，还用开会只管追哩！玉宝说：秋天庄稼就是十分庄稼八分收。司马政治主任说：年年收秋是追哩。苏店丑仁组里的人说：等天晴了再说吧！高河有的群众说：等天晴了晒晒再收吧！不迟哩。在解决这种思想是让群众讨论庄稼到底黄了没有，黄了该怎办，天阴了要想睛天非刮西北风不行，已经黄了的谷子，经过大西北风一刮，就要损失。打通群众思想后行动起来。一种是园地多的村，重视菜园，轻视旱地的思想，如苏店王和则组说：误了园地是一年过合哩，就让大家讨论：光种菜不种田禾行不行？并让大家回忆灾年没收上粮食，只种上菜渡不了灾荒的事实，并提出：“轻视田禾重视园，光吃蔬菜不顶粮”的口号，解决了这个问题。
    第二是典型推动作用：各村里的典型组与人物的带头，推动了全村，如天河曹林水在自己组里，先订出计划与细密的计工折工办法，组织男女全半辅助劳力，及时奖励积极分子的办法推动了其他各组。苏店在提出组织妇女儿童上地时，有些人轻视妇女儿童，觉得不中用。有些人并说：妇女儿童能顶多大事，只要男人少吃一袋烟，就把他们做的生活赶出来了。在干部组长积极分子会上，毕二云介绍了自己组里组织妇女儿童的经验。他组里割谷时，参加了八个男全劳力，六个妇女，两个儿童，全组三十三亩谷，一天就割完了。妇女还割的很快，二云嫂一天割了二亩四，秋国老婆一天割了二亩二，并说：你们说妇女不顶事，我说妇女儿童齐动手上地，组织起来顶机器。这样打通了大家的轻视妇女思想，并提出：“妇女儿童齐动手，能顶男人多半手”的口号。第二天全村便有五百五十六个妇女，一百四十四个儿童，一百二十八个老汉上了地。故县全村也是在贾聚和互助组的带头下行动起来，并展开了黑夜上地抢收的运动。
    第三、贫雇骨干领导培养运用积极分子：
    在这一段运动中，证明那个村是贫雇骨干（包括村干部和组长）领导的，那个村的运动就开展的好。如天河十一个互助组，九个组长是贫农，一个是中农，所以运动开展的就很快、很好。苏店四十一个互助组，组长里边有十个中农，中农领导的互助组就不起劲。
    冯村有两个富农担任互助组组长，一直怕斗，表现不积极。有一个组，一个贫农当组长，其余都是中农，被中农掌握，一个贫农起不了骨干作用，所以是“名义互助”。他们是经过解决思想问题以后，重新自愿结合，把两个富农组长换了，还换了六个中农组长，运动便开展起来了。
    同时在好的村又是大批培养和运用了积极分子，如曹林水自己的第二分队里，就有十个积极分子，全村各个组里都有积极分子，苏店各街也有很多积极分子起带头，高河北头没有积极分子，所以运动是比较消沉的。
    第四、大量组织半劳力和辅助劳力。
    在组织半劳力与辅助劳力，主要是组织妇女儿童，在方法上首先必须克服两种思想：一种是轻视妇女儿童的思想，在天河有这样的口号“要想打胜仗，孩子老婆一齐上”。一种是妇女本身看不起自己，和认为劳动丢人。同时用家庭分红方法提高她们的积极性，如天河曹林水队三分队的妇女，在开始组织参加秋收时，他们就提出：去年说得工资分红哩，结果在那里哩？她们首先是规定了和家庭分红办法，每天赚到的工票，归她个人保管，提高了积极性。毕二云家庭实行了分红办法，他嫂在撇玉茭时，胳膊使肿了。二云娘说你在家休息吧！他说八路军抗战到底哩，我撇玉茭也要撇到底。林水的家庭分红办法是：林水妻和弟妻，一个做饭，一个上地，上地赚上的工票，和家里四六分红，家里要六，四归自己。分到的红，做饭和上地的再对半分开。再一个是积极分子的带头作用。如林水娘六十多岁了，参加劳动很积极，天一明就叫人上地，影响的其他人也都积极了。二云组二云嫂和秋国老婆两个人，把全组九个妇女都带起来了。再一个折工计工上，必须细密，必须按件计工，如苏店丑仁组，割谷时规定了割一个谷五块钱。小脚妇女跑着上地多割。在撇玉茭时，因没规定出等价办法，妇女们在地里只管仰头望天想早回去。天河杨合则组，规定切一个谷五块钱，两个九岁的保花，和巧莲还要参加切谷，一早切六个谷。再一个在互助开会时，也可让妇女参加，提高他的地位。二云组就经常参加。杨合则组开始全组没劲头，开会整顿了一下，妇女也都参加了会，妇女也都积极起来。
    第五、开展竞赛表扬模范及时奖励。
    各村都运用广播筒，差不多每黑夜都广播，除广播主要模范典型人物外，同时也把各街各组的模范典型都广播出去。如苏店除经常介绍表扬毕二云组以外，其它也及时表扬了。如西街二早组使用劳力的方法，割谷时青年男劳力到远地，青年妇女老汉小孩在近一些的地，小脚走不动及老一些的妇女在近地。全组二十二户，除四五个老一些的妇女做饭外都上了地，也抓紧表扬了，所以大家的劲头都很大。苏店在广播时并配合上乐器，先奏一回，引起群众注意后再说话。
    各村各街之间，都开展了竞赛，天河并做了两面红旗，南北天河争取夺红旗。
    同时在个人方面，还用了奖励办法，曹林水大队是每天黑夜算了工帐以后，把一天里最好的积极分子经过大众提出奖励分票，分票的来源是一天做的活按劳力算开，每人应得的零数如一分二厘，所余二厘，就归了奖励，这样每天奖励，大家的积极性更大。毕二云和故县贾聚有组都是从副业生产中抽出一部分钱买了一些手巾做为总结时组里的奖品。
