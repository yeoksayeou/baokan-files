The Special Commissioner's Office Awards Banner, Praising Wangjiayuan's Five Strengths

[Our newspaper, Taiyue, 10th dispatch] Wangjiayuan Model Village in Qinshui County was commended by the Special Commissioner's Office and awarded a silk banner reading "Model Upon Model, Merit Upon Merit." The Special Commissioner's Office pointed out that Wangjiayuan had made great achievements in production during the spring plowing, summer hoeing, grass cutting, and wheat planting seasons, and has five major strengths: First, the village cadres have a good democratic style, following the mass line in everything, and letting the masses discuss and deliberate; second, the mutual aid groups are consolidated and persistent, never disbanding from their establishment this spring to the present, and becoming more consolidated and expanded; third, they take good care of the families of military cadres and martyrs, and the families of militiamen and laborers on expeditions, planting wheat for all forty expedition laborers; fourth, the combination of work and errands is good, so that those participating in the war are at ease and those engaged in production are energetic; fifth, the organization of women, children, old men, and semi-laborers is good, truly achieving both participation in the war and production without fail.

[Our newspaper, Taiyue, 10th dispatch] Quyu No. 1 District, Xiadi, Shangxiaban, Tanjia, Dongxishi, Yuandong and other seven villages in Yuanqu County have begun to harvest corn. After cutting the millet, they rushed to peel the corn on the 20th of last month. In Xiadi and Shangxiaban, old men, women, and children all went to the fields. The strong carried the corn, and the weaker peeled it or drove livestock, calculating and recording work points according to the number of loads. In two days, Xiadi peeled more than 900 mu, and Shangxiaban peeled more than 1,200 mu. Tanjia, Dongxishi, and Yuandong peeled more than 2,700 mu in two and a half days. The head of the Xiadi mutual aid group said: "This year, the labor force is two-thirds less than in previous years, but the harvest is faster than in previous years. The power of organization is truly great."
