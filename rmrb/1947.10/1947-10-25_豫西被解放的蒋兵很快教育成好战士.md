　　Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 23rd—The 5th Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has achieved remarkable results in educating liberated soldiers. According to a report by correspondent Ke Zhou: After a recent batch of liberated soldiers joined the army, the company held a forum to "hand over family property and talk about family traditions to the masters (referring to liberated soldiers)." The entire company's funds and their sources, as well as the economic system, production system, supply system, and the relationship between officers and soldiers, were introduced, so that everyone could manage their own family property from the position of masters. Company Commander Yang Fashi and Political Instructor Han Bingcheng also introduced the company's history and glorious combat history, especially explaining in detail the "Model for Consolidating the Troops" banner awarded by the regiment, calling on everyone to work hard to maintain the glorious family traditions. One liberated soldier immediately said to the squad leader: "I will never let down the Second Squad. There are still many things I don't understand. I hope you will tell me more. I want to study hard." Song Shutian said: "I will study hard and guarantee not to ruin the family traditions." They also organized new and old liberated soldiers to talk about their experiences after joining the army, which fundamentally eliminated the Kuomintang bandits' rumors and deceptions about the "People's Liberation Army burying prisoners alive" and "not killing now, but killing in the future." Political Instructor Han Bingcheng first said that he was captured by the enemy in Zhongtiao Mountain in 1942, but not only was he not killed, but he became a political instructor because of his hard work. He said: "As long as you do good things for the people, the Communist Party will never bury a capable person." Then, a mass conversation was formed. Deputy Squad Leader Hu Wenchang, Squad Leader Chen Yuefeng, Li Hancheng, and others introduced their situations. Ma Wenfu, a new recruit, said: Many squad leaders in the People's Liberation Army are promoted from liberated soldiers. The People's Liberation Army truly values talents. When new liberated soldiers accidentally lost things in combat, veteran soldiers automatically gave them clothes, greatly moving the new liberated soldiers. They encouraged each other, saying: "If old comrades respect us by one foot, we must return them by one yard. All duties must be done consciously." Many people quickly transformed into good soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

　　豫西被解放的蒋兵很快教育成好战士
    【新华社豫西前线二十三日电】人民解放军某部五连教育解放战士成绩昭著。据通讯员克洲报导：最近一批解放战士入伍后，连上便召开座谈会，“向主人（指解放战士）交家当谈家风。”把全连的基金及其来源和经济制度、生产制度、供给制度、官兵关系等作了介绍，使大家站在主人地位去经营自己的家当。连长杨发士、政指韩秉诚又把该连历史和光荣的战斗史都作了介绍，特别将团部奖给的“巩固部队模范”锦旗作了详细的解释，号召大家为保持光荣的家风努力。有个解放战士即向班长说：“我决不给二班丢人，我不懂得的还很多，希望你们多给我讲，我要好好学习。”宋书天说：“我要好好学习，保证不败坏家风。”他们又组织新老解放战士谈自己入伍后的情况，使大家根本消除了蒋匪关于“解放军活埋俘虏”、“现在不杀将来杀”的造谣和欺骗。政指韩秉诚首先说他是民国三十一年在中条山被俘的，不但没有被杀，而且因为工作努力，现在当了政治指导员。他说：“只要好好为老百姓做事，共产党决不会埋没一个能干的人。”接着就形成了群众性的交谈。副班长胡文昌、班长陈月风、李汉成等都把自己的情况作了介绍。新来的马文富说：解放军的许多班长都是解放战士升起来的，解放军真是不屈人才。新解放战士在战斗中不慎丢失了东西，老战士便自动送给他们衣服等，大大的感动了新解放战士。他们互相劝勉说：“老战友敬我们一尺，我们要回敬一丈，一切勤务都要自觉的去干。”许多人很快就转变成解放军的好战士了。
