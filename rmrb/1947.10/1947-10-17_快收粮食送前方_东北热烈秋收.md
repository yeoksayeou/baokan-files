Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 15th: With the victorious advance of the counter-offensive troops on the front lines, millions of farmers are joyfully singing "Autumn harvest is more important than the three seasons of spring, rush to harvest grain for the front lines" on 120 million mu of cultivated land in the rear of the Northeast Liberated Areas, reaping the fruits of their labor in the first year after gaining ownership of the land. Although crops in a few areas have been affected by floods and insect plagues this year, due to the fact that farmers have become the masters of the land, their labor is more diligent, and production mutual aid has been organized, the cultivated area has greatly increased. In the Northern Manchuria region alone, it has increased by 8.5 million mu, with a minimum increase in grain production of 400,000 tons. Therefore, the overall harvest has not weakened compared to the past. After the "cut down big trees and dig out hidden production" movement, poor and lower-middle peasants have carts and horses, and their enthusiasm for mutual aid in the autumn harvest is extremely high. The poor and lower-middle peasants in Cheng Guan District, Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, are united and have proposed "Quickly reap, quickly transport, and quickly deliver public grain." Villages are engaging in enthusiastic competitions with each other. In Chang'an Village, Tai'an District, all 109 laborers, 53 livestock, and 21 carts have been organized to harvest, transport, and thresh simultaneously, breaking the past mechanical three-stage process of reaping, transporting, and threshing, which has greatly improved the efficiency of autumn harvest labor exchange compared to spring plowing and summer hoeing. Shuangcheng County has put forward the slogan of "three quicks and one tight" (namely, quick reaping, quick transporting, quick threshing, and tight delivery of public grain) during the harvest, which directly promoted the autumn harvest. The Fourth District completed more than two-thirds of the harvest within ten days. Women have generally gone to the fields during the autumn harvest. In Baomin District, Tao'an County, Liaobei Province, more than 1,400 women have gone to the fields. Under the leadership of village cadres, children in various places have also gone to the fields to help military families with the harvest and have launched a "no grain ear left behind" competition slogan. In Sujiagou, Jingpo County, Mudanjiang, the entire village is engaged in large-scale labor exchange, with more than 40 young women actively participating, and elderly women standing guard, looking after children, and exchanging labor with young women. The Jilin Branch of the Military and Political University, the Democratic College, and primary and secondary school students in various places have also gone to the countryside to help the masses with the autumn harvest for three days. In Du'erbote Banner, Nenjiang Province, villages and hamlets are implementing joint defense during the harvest. The joint defense teams are going to the fields with rifles and foreign guns, harvesting while guarding against sabotage activities by reactionary landlords, bandits, and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. In the border areas and guerrilla areas, while combining labor and military affairs and engaging in a tense autumn harvest, the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' grain robbery is resolutely carried out. In various parts of Eastern Chahar, emancipated peasants are organizing autumn harvest teams under the cover of armed field protection teams, fighting and harvesting at the same time. In order to ensure the military and civilian food supply for the great counter-offensive, the Jidong District Party Committee is also carrying out armed autumn protection and stepping up the autumn harvest and wheat planting.
