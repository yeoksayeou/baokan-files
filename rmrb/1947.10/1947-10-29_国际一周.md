　　International Week
    October 20th to 26th

    The continuous growth of left-wing people's power in the French and Italian municipal elections, and the victory of the French workers' general strike, are major events in Europe this week. On the eve of the French and Italian municipal elections, American imperialism used political and economic means in an attempt to reverse the leftward trend of the French and Italian people and support the resurgence of reactionary forces, so as to carry out its imperialist plan to enslave Europe. However, the results of the Rome municipal elections show that, despite the joint offensive of all domestic and foreign reactionary forces, the Italian People's Group, led by the Communist Party and the Nenni Socialist Party, still surpassed the Christian Democratic Party and won victory in Rome, the world center of reactionary Catholicism. The People's Group not only restored the votes lost due to the betrayal of the right-wing Socialist Saragat faction, but also gained 18,000 more votes than last year. The first round of voting in the French municipal elections also showed that the people's democratic forces represented by the French Communist Party can not only defend their positions in the face of the increasingly rampant French reactionary forces and the blatant interference of the United States, but also always seize new positions and expand their strength in successive elections. The figures published by L'Humanité on the 23rd show that the de Gaulle Group, which has been desperately supported by the American, British and French reactionaries, has been on a downward slope in successive elections since the liberation of France. In the referendum on May 5 last year, the de Gaulle Group could deceive 53 percent of the French votes; in this municipal election, although it sacrificed the Popular Republican Movement and the Socialist Party, it still only won 38.4 percent of the votes. The percentage of the French Communist Party increased from 26 percent in October of the year before last, to 28 percent in November of last year, and then to 30.65 percent in October of this year. This situation has greatly disappointed the American, British and French reactionaries, and even made them feel that in the next election, the "unexpected defeat" suffered by the Popular Republican Movement in this municipal election may fall on the de Gaulle "Alliance" again.

    The strike struggle of French merchant seamen and Paris transportation workers led by the French General Confederation of Labor has ended victoriously. In this strike, the American and French authorities used threats and "tough" measures, but due to the French workers' persistence in the struggle, and the statement by the Communist Ennaff, the general secretary of the Paris Labor Union Federation, on a general strike, the collusion and intimidation conspiracy of the American and French reactionaries was defeated, forcing the Ramadier authorities to "almost agree to all the demands of the strikers." This proves that as long as the working class is determined to fight, it is not difficult to achieve victory against the offensive of the reactionaries.

    The Congress of Industrial Organizations of the United States, one of the largest labor organizations in the United States, passed a resolution at its recent annual meeting, calling on the working class to carry out international cooperation through trade union organizations, oppose the new war propaganda of a small number of evil forces in the United States, demand the restoration of the policy of the Big Three unity, and deeply believe that the offensive of the American reactionaries to provoke a new war "will inevitably suffer the powerful and relentless opposition of all free and peace-loving people, and the will of the people of every country will eventually end the activities of this small number of evil elements." The CIO resolution fiercely criticized the Truman government's domestic policies leading to fascism, demanded a struggle against anti-labor laws, and dissolved the House Un-American Activities Investigation Committee, which "threatens American freedom." These progressive domestic and foreign policy resolutions of the CIO were passed after defeating the various obstructions and sabotage of the reactionary elements within it, which shows that although there are many "people who are tools of Wall Street" within the CIO, the progressive forces within the CIO still occupy an overwhelming advantage.

    The informal delegation of British Labour Party members of parliament, which had visited the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia for a month, has returned home. In their visits and after returning home, the delegation made several statements praising the prosperous economic life of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe based on their personal experience, recognizing the beliefs of these countries in loving peace and defending peace, and severely criticizing the American imperialist policy of provoking a new war, striving to "strengthen economic relations with Eastern Europe to get rid of the control of American capital." These understandings and calls reflect the sentiments and demands of the broad masses of the British people. The delegation's visit to Eastern Europe will help strengthen the friendship between the British people and the people of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and also reflects the increasing division within the Labour Party.

    In the Far East, French imperialism has launched a war of aggression against the Vietnamese people, and the Vietnamese people have set off a new upsurge in the war to defend their homeland. This war policy of French imperialism, which attempts to continue to enslave the Vietnamese people, will inevitably arouse the indignation of world public opinion, especially Asian nations. In addition, with the direct help of American imperialism, the Dutch invading army has launched a third offensive against the Indonesian capital, and the Indonesian people are rising up to fight resolutely to repel the invading army.

　　国际一周
    十月廿至廿六日
    法意市选中左冀人民力量的不断增长，以及法国工人大罢工的获胜，是一周来欧洲的重大事件。在法意市选前夕，美国帝国主义曾使用政治与经济的手段，亟图扭转法意人民的左倾趋向，扶植反动势力卷土重来，以便其遂行奴役欧洲的帝国主义计划。但罗马市选的结果表明，虽然有国内外一切反动势力的联合攻势，以共产党与南尼社会党为首的意国人民集团，却仍然在反动天主教的世界中心——罗马，超过基督教民主党而赢得了胜利。人民集团不仅恢复了因社会党右派萨拉盖特派叛变所失掉的选票，而且比去年多得了一万八千票。法国市选的第一次投票，也标明法国共产党所代表的人民民主力量，不仅在日益嚣张的法国反动势力及美国露骨的干涉之前能坚守其阵地，而且在历次选举中，总能夺得新阵地，扩大其力量。人道报二十三日所发表的数字，说明了一向为美英法反动派所拼命支持的戴高乐集团，在法国解放后历届选举中，是一直走着下坡路的。去年五月五日复决中，戴高乐集团可以骗到法国选票的百分之五十三；今年的这次市选中，它虽然以人民共和党与社会党作牺牲，但获得的选票仍仅占百分之三十八点四。而法共的百分比，则由前年十月的百分之二十六，增至去年十一月的百分之二十八，再增至今年十月的百分之三十点六五。这种形势，使得美英法反动派大失所望，甚至感到：在下次选举中，象人民共和党在这次市选中所遭到的“出乎任何人意外的溃败”，可能再次落到戴高乐“联盟”的头上。
    法国总工会所领导的法国商船工人与巴黎交通工人罢工斗争，已胜利结束。在这次罢工中，美法当局使用威赫与“强硬”手段，但由于法国工人的坚持斗争，以及巴黎工联总书记共产党人恩那弗关于总罢工的声明，击溃了美法反动派狼狈为奸的恫吓阴谋，迫使拉马第当局“几乎同意了罢工者的一切要求”。这证明：只要工人阶级有坚持战斗的决心，对反动派的攻势是不难取得胜利的。
    美国最大劳工组织之一的美国产业工会联合会，在其最近的年会中通过决议，号召工人阶级通过工会机构实行国际合作，反对美国少数恶势力的新战争宣传，要求恢复三强团结的政策，深信美国反动派所领导的挑拨新战争的攻势，“必遭受一切自由与爱好和平的人民强大而无情的反对，每个国家人民的意志终将结束这一少数罪恶分子的活动”。产联决议猛烈抨击杜鲁门政府引向法西斯主义的各项内政举措，要求对反劳工法展开斗争，并解散“威胁美国自由”的众院非美活动调查委员会。产联这一些进步的内外政策的决议，是在击溃了其内部的反动份子百般阻挠与破坏之后，始获得通过的，这说明在产联内部虽有不少“为华尔街工具的人们”，但产联内部的进步势力仍占据压倒的优势。
    遍访苏、波、捷、南四国达一月之久的英工党议员非正式代表团，业已返国。该代表团在访问时以及返国后，所作的历次声明，都以亲身经历赞扬苏联与东欧新民主国家欣欣向荣的经济生活，认识了各该国热爱和平和保卫和平的信念，并严辞抨击美帝国主义挑拨新战争的政策，力求“加强与东欧之经济关系，以摆脱美国资本的控制”。这些认识和呼声，反映了英国广大人民的情绪与要求。这一代表团的访问东欧，将有利于加强英国人民与苏联及东欧新民主国家人民的友谊，同时亦反映了工党内部的日趋分裂。
    在远东，法帝国主义对越南人民发动了侵略战，越南人民已掀起祖国保卫战的新高潮。法帝国主义这种企图继续奴役越南人民的战争政策，势将激起世界舆论尤其是亚洲民族的义愤。此外，在美帝国主义的直接帮助下，荷兰侵略军向印尼首都又发动了第三次攻势，印尼人民正奋起为击退侵略军而坚决战斗。（新华社）
