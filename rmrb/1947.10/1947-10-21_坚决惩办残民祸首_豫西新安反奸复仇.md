　　Resolutely Punish the Chief Culprits Who Harm the People
  　Xinan, Western Henan, Counter-espionage and Revenge
    [Our Taiyue Dispatch, 19th] After Xinan, Western Henan, was liberated again, an anti-traitor and revenge movement was launched. Especially in the villages of the first district, the peasants universally rose up to capture traitors and bullies and seek justice and revenge. The masses of Shitou Village captured the traitor and bully Chen Hualong. A grievance and revenge meeting was held on the 21st of last month. More than 2,000 people attended. They first tearfully and sadly mourned the peasant leaders such as Liu Xishui who were killed by the traitor Chen. Then, Zhao Zhongshan, Li Qingrong and other poor people poured out their grievances, each word with tears, weeping incessantly. Before the war, Chen was once a village chief, squeezing and extorting, conscripting soldiers, and raping women, doing everything evil. Later, he became a traitor for the Japanese invaders. After our army liberated western Henan in 1944, the peasants accused him of various crimes. At that time, the democratic government ordered him to compensate the peasants for their losses and apologize to the peasants, but still allowed him to repent and start anew, and released him leniently. However, after our army withdrew from western Henan, the traitor colluded with the Chiang bandits again, surrounded the whole village, killed four peasant leaders, cruelly tortured them, bankrupted ten families, extorted more than 20 households, and extorted 50 taels of opium and 3,000 catties of wheat. The rest of the peasants fled in panic and wandered elsewhere. Chen also assassinated peasants Zhao Huaiyu and others, raped Zhao's niece-in-law, and forced his nephew to death. In the raging fire of the peasants' grievances and revenge, Chen was immediately sentenced to death.

　　坚决惩办残民祸首
  　豫西新安反奸复仇
    【本报太岳十九日电】豫西新安重获解放后，掀起反奸复仇运动，尤其一区各村农民，普遍起来捉拿奸霸，伸冤报仇。石头村群众捕获了奸霸陈花龙，已于上月二十一日开了伸冤复仇大会，到会群众两千余人，他们首先含着眼泪沉痛追悼了被陈逆杀害的刘锡水等农民领袖，随即赵中山、李清荣等苦人诉苦，一字一泪，哭泣不已。陈逆战前曾当过乡长，压榨勒索，拨兵抓丁，强奸妇女，无所不为。后又为日寇当汉奸。四四年我军解放豫西后，农民曾控诉其种种罪恶，当时民主政府令其赔偿农民损失，向农民认错外，仍准其悔过自新，宽大释放。但当我军撤出豫西后，该逆复勾结蒋匪，包围全村，杀害农民领袖四人，酷刑吊打，倾家荡产者十人，被讹诈者二十余户，敲诈鸦片五十两，麦子三千斤，其余农民恐慌逃跑，流落他乡，陈逆又暗杀农民赵怀玉等，并强奸赵之侄媳，逼死其侄儿。在农民诉苦复仇的怒火中，当即判处陈逆死刑。
