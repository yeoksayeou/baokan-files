(This dispatch from the Jilu Yu Border Region was filed on the 17th) Since Yanggu First District created the family meeting, various places have now accepted the experience and applied it to various tasks, achieving great results. In Qianli Village, Yanggu Fifth District, when holding a village-wide women's member meeting to discuss the complete elimination of landlords and the issue of self-reporting, it was decided to go home and hold family meetings to encourage self-reporting. One woman member, upon returning home, immediately convened a family meeting. She said, "Should we report the two sets of gowns we have hidden from the landlord?" Her father-in-law said, "We can't report those. I've saved them for a long time, and I need to wear them." She said, "If we don't report them, do we still have a conscience? Let's think about how we were starving to death during the famine years. We managed to get a dou of corn and pushed a small cart to beg for food in Henan, but when we arrived at Anle Town, we were stopped by Fan Tingqin, the landlord from our village (who was the district chief at the time, as Anle Town was a puppet stronghold). He confiscated the corn, and he didn't care even when we cried. Didn't we come back starving again? Later, we barely survived without starving to death in his hands. How can we still hide things for him? How can we face the people who suffered the same hunger as us?" At this point, the whole family cried. Her father-in-law then said, "Report! We must report. Even if you don't report it, I will. I feel it's only right to speak from the heart and talk about our suffering." In this way, after the whole family poured out their grievances, their thinking became clear. At the mass meeting, they reported the goods and confessed their thoughts amidst tears. Influenced by them, eight out of more than twenty households in the village reported goods and confessed their thoughts while pouring out their grievances. In the Dali Lou Mountain area of Guancheng, Zhang Yingrong, the women's committee member, had a husband and father who were "backward." In order to influence her husband and father to make progress, she convened a family grievance meeting. Her brother, Huai Lin, said, "Thinking about the past is really painful. I worked for the landlord Li Xiufeng during the day, and I still did my own carpentry work at night. When other people ate dinner, I just smoked a few bags of tobacco and worked with them." He teared up as he spoke. Her husband, who never spoke before, also began to pour out his grievances, saying, "When we fled to Linjin, we didn't have enough travel expenses halfway. We didn't dare to ask for food when staying at an inn. The shopkeeper asked me several times what I wanted to eat, but I just said I wasn't hungry. Because of the rain, we stayed for two days and only ate one meal." He also teared up and said, "Now that we have food and drink, we must never forget the Communist Party in our lifetime." Her father-in-law also sighed and said, "What's the point of mentioning this? I can't finish talking about the suffering in two days." After pouring out their grievances, the thinking of her husband and father-in-law also began to change. He Xi also first convened family meetings before distributing the fruits of victory. When a poor peasant family in Zhao Guan Town discussed things, the old mother said, "Let's get a pot." Her husband said, "We have a broken pot that can still be used. We were allocated two mu of land that haven't been hoed yet, so let's get a hoe." In other places, young women wanted clothes and children wanted toys at family meetings, unifying everyone's demands, and everyone was very satisfied.

　　家庭会议经验普遍推广运用
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】自阳谷一区创造家庭会议后，现各地已接受经验，用到各种工作中去，获得极大成绩。阳谷五区千里村，在召开全村农妇会员大会，讨论彻底消灭地主与自报问题时，决定回家开家庭会，发动自报。一个妇会员回到家，就召集全家人开会，她说：“咱家存的地主那两身大褂报了吧？”她公爹说：“那不能报，我存了很久，我得穿。”她说：“不报咱还有良心不？咱想想那灾荒年饿的要死，弄到一斗玉米，推着小车要到河南去要饭，但到了安乐镇，就被咱庄的地主范廷秦（当时安乐镇是伪据点，范当区长）查住了，把玉米给没收，咱哭他也不理，咱不是又饿着回来了吗？后来好容易没饿死在他手里，咱再给他存东西，怎么能对起和咱一样挨饿的人们呢？”说到这里，全家人都哭了，她公爹这时也说：“报！一定报，你不报我也要报，我觉得说说良心话，说说咱的苦处才痛快。”这样，全家诉苦后，思想都通了，在群众大会上，连哭带东西都报了。在他影响下，全村二十多户就有八家在诉苦中报了东西，献了思想。观城大李楼山区妇女委员张英容家中，丈夫和父亲“落后”，为了影响丈夫和父亲进步，便召开家庭诉苦会，她哥怀林说：“提起过去，真难受，白天给地主李秀峰做活，晚上还做自己木匠活，人家下晌吃饭，我下晌光吸几袋烟，就跟人家一块干活。”说到这里，落下泪来。从不发言的丈夫也诉起苦来说：“逃难到临津时，半路没盘费，下店不敢说吃饭，掌柜的问我几次吃啥饭，光说不饿。因下雨，住了两天，才吃一顿饭。”说着也落泪，并说：“现在，有吃有喝，一辈子也不能忘了共产党。”老公公也咳声叹气的说：“提这干啥，说苦我两天也说不完。”经过诉苦后，她丈夫及公公的思想也开始转变了。河西分果实也先召开家庭会议。赵官镇一家贫农商议时，老妈妈说：“咱要个锅吧。”她老头子说：“咱有破锅，还能使，分了二亩地没锄，咱要张锄吧。”其他各地群众在家庭会议上青年妇女要衣服，儿童要玩具，统一各人的要求，大家都很满意。
