All Women Participate in Labor, Autumn Harvest and Autumn Planting Completed on Time
Shi Zhenming Organizes Labor Exchange Teams
Helping Other Areas Seize the Warmth and Rush Planting

[This newspaper, Taiyue, 19th dispatch] The joint mutual aid team of five villages led by labor heroes Shi Zhenming and Zhao Meiying of Fushan has organized all women and semi-labor forces, making them the main force for autumn harvest and autumn planting. The five administrative villages of Fancun, Chuankou, Tuling, Yantou, and Guanyinmiao have a total of 576 male full laborers and male semi-laborers (i.e., those capable of transportation and carrying), of which 162 remain after participation in the war effort and support of the front lines. There are 279 male semi-laborers (those only able to do field work) (old men account for two-fifths, children account for three-fifths), 474 female full laborers, and 496 female semi-laborers. A total of 1,132 male and female full and semi-laborers have been put into the autumn harvest and wheat planting, of which women account for more than 85% of the total labor force. They actively participate in various agricultural tasks such as plowing, sowing, chopping corn, and harvesting grain. During the autumn harvest alone, the seven women and three men in the Wang Fuquan couple's merit group led by Zhao Meiying chopped 32 mu of corn in one night. Thirty-two women from several villages in Xisongshan harvested 45 mu of grain in one morning. The seven women in the Yang Shuangxi group in Chuankou harvested 30 mu of grain in three days. The ten women in the Song Mei group in Yantou harvested 50 mu of grain in seven days. Thanks to their active labor, the 24,899 mu of grain in the five administrative villages were quickly harvested, and two-thirds have been threshed and stored, while the rest have been carried back to the threshing floor. More than 90% of the corn has also been chopped down. During wheat planting, they again actively plowed and sowed, becoming the backbone of labor. More than 150 women plowed, and 32 women in Fancun plowed 464 mu of land. Wang Fuquan, Li Fenghua, and others from the couple's merit group in Houzhai pulled the seed drill to plant wheat, planting 72 mu in six and a half days. In particular, the small-footed woman Chai Xiuying, in addition to plowing and planting her own 22 mu of wheat, also plowed 32 mu of land for military dependents, such as Lu Shangzhong. The ten women in the Song Mei group in Yantou planted 30 mu of wheat for three military families. All 4,350.7 mu of wheat in the entire brigade have been sown, and they are now rushing to plant catch crops. Old hero Shi Zhenming happily said: "Even if all the male full laborers go to war, with our female labor experts, production will not be delayed."

[This newspaper, Taiyue, 19th dispatch] After completing most of the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the joint mutual aid team of five villages led by labor heroes Shi Zhenming and Zhao Meiying of Fushan, in order to help solve the difficulty of labor shortage in various villages in the second district, drew 55 livestock and 55 male and female team members from Guanyinmiao, Chuankou, Yantou, Fancun, and Tuling villages of the joint brigade, and formed a far-reaching labor exchange team. On October 10, led by Shi Zhenming and Zhao Meiying, they went to Helu, Zhaocheng, Mijia Yuan, Pangjia Yuan and other villages in the second district to implement a large-scale labor exchange to seize the warmth and rush planting to counter-attack wheat. Their policy is: first only plow and plant for military martyrs, families of war dead, civilian laborers, and militiamen, then plant for members of the farmers' association, with a fixed period of seven days, after which they return to the village to plow autumn stubble land.
