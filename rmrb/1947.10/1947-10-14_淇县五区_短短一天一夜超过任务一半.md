Qixian Fifth District
Surpassed Half the Task in Just One Day and Night
[Our newspaper's Qixian dispatch] At the mobilization meeting for village cadres and activists in the Fifth District to join the army, the current situation was first reported: Liu Deng's troops had already reached the Yangtze River, a nationwide counter-offensive had been launched, and Chiang Kai-shek would soon be finished. In order to cooperate with the great counter-offensive and strive to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, we must expand our armed forces, protect our gains from the land reform, and achieve permanent liberation. After everyone's discussion, their enthusiasm was extremely high. Twenty-six young people immediately volunteered to join the army and asked to return immediately to report the news to the masses. District and village cadres returned overnight, some without even eating, and immediately convened the masses for mobilization. In just one day and night, one hundred and twenty-nine young people voluntarily signed up to join the counter-offensive army, exceeding half of the task. Han Changwen and Chen Quande from Wenlizhuang personally sent their sons to join the army. Feng Xiaoniu, a woman from Sidebao, only in her twenties, personally sent her husband to join the army. Zhang Jinquan and Zhang Jinhai, two brothers from Xinxiangtun, competed to sign up. In particular, Gao Cun's × Erdou repeatedly urged his nephew when he sent him off: "Don't forget to avenge me!" In the tide of joining the army, the whole village volunteered ten people and formed a revenge squad. When the new soldiers left, parents, brothers, and wives of each family exhorted their loved ones, telling them to fight well on the outside and not to worry about family affairs. Yan Chuan said to his brother: "When you go to the front to fight, be sure to capture Yan Hongshan first and let the old folks in our village vent their anger!" (Zhide, Youfu, Jiuru, Weizuo)
