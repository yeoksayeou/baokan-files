　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 1st: A certain unit of the Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces, captured three strongholds on the Huaiyin-Shuyang highway—Xu Liu, Hu Ji, and Qian Ji—on the 25th. (Note: Hu Ji and Qian Ji were once captured by the People's Liberation Army in April.) They now control over 80 li of the highway, cutting off the passage for Chiang's troops from Yanzhuo to Huaihai. On the 24th, after the People's Liberation Army and local militia wiped out the enemy in the areas of Liutang River east of the road, they surrounded the Xu Liu stronghold. On the 25th, after defeating three battalions of enemy reinforcements, they launched a general attack. The brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Army charged through four layers of elm branch barricades and water pits over a Zhang deep, capturing eight layers of clamp walls seven Chi high and four large bunkers. Within half an hour, they completely annihilated the 6th Company of the 178th Regiment of Chiang's 75th Division, recovering Xu Liu. The enemy guarding Hu Ji and Qian Ji fled upon hearing the news, and both places were also liberated. A total of over 30 enemies, including the positive and deputy company commanders Li (Yi) and Yao (Hongsi) of the company were killed or wounded, and over 60 were captured alive (the entire company totaled 98 men), as well as over 90 Chiang's "refugee team leaders" such as Lu Ruzhen. In this battle, a total of over 220 enemies were annihilated, and three small cannons and nine light and heavy machine guns were captured.
