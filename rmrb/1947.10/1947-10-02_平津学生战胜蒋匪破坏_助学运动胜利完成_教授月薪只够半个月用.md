Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. *Jin Bao* reports: Schools at all levels in Peiping and Tientsin have largely commenced classes by September 20th. The student and worker movement, which has suffered heavy sabotage by the Chiang bandits, has successfully completed its initial fundraising efforts and is currently discussing distribution plans. The donations raised in Peiping amount to approximately 500 million in Chiang currency, which is still insufficient for distribution given the large number of impoverished students in universities and middle schools. The Aid Committee is calling for a spirit of concession: "Older brothers should give way to younger brothers, and those in difficult situations should give way to those in complete despair." All applications for assistance must undergo strict scrutiny. The street fundraising for the student aid campaign in Tientsin ended on the 10th, with special fundraising still underway. It is estimated that the total amount raised will be around 300 million. The Aid Committee has now formed visiting groups to investigate the family circumstances of impoverished students applying for student aid in order to determine the list of recipients. Furthermore, the problem of unemployment for this year's graduates in Peiping is extremely serious. Many Peking University graduates have not found jobs and are still staying in dormitories, and they feel they have nowhere to stand due to repeated urging from the university to move out.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Hebei, 30th. The plight of Peking University professors Zhou Zuoren and Xiang Da can be seen as an epitome of the living conditions of professors in Chiang-controlled areas. According to Peng Zigang's "Visiting Professors in the Autumn Wind," an article in the *Tianjin Dagong Bao* on the 17th, Zhou has been teaching at Peking University for more than ten years without interruption or leave. He said that his family of seven currently consumes 150 catties of rice per month, which takes up half of his entire monthly salary of 1.6 million Chiang currency. One month's salary is only enough for half a month's expenses. The miserable situation in Kunming, where buying rice meant not being able to buy vegetables, and buying vegetables meant not being able to buy clothes, has now completely returned. Of his four children, three were fortunate enough to attend municipal middle schools, and the youngest was able to enter a municipal elementary school only after repeated requests and favors, thus narrowly avoiding being out of school. The burden of life has weighed down this fifty-year-old professor, who can be described as "skin and bones." Zhou, who teaches banking and currency, believes that "reforming the currency system is useless under the current circumstances. It's just to make the calculation of Chiang currency a little easier."

Professor Xiang Da, an authority on Western Regions history, has been teaching at Peking University for eight years. This year happened to be his sabbatical, but in order to repay the three million debt to Peking University and to address the problem of coal for the winter, he had to abandon his vacation and go south to the research institute to sit on the sidelines, earning a few stipends so that his family would not freeze and starve in the winter.

　　平津学生战胜蒋匪破坏
  　助学运动胜利完成
  　教授月薪只够半个月用
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】津报讯：平津各级学校大体均已在九月二十日前开课。备受蒋匪重重破坏的学生工人运动已胜利完成初步募捐工作，目前正会商分配计划中。北平募捐所得约为蒋币五亿元，以大中学贫寒学生数量之众，仍不敷分配。助委会号召礼让运动“大哥哥让小弟弟，情形困难会让完全绝望的。”申请资助的均须经严格审查。津市助学运动街头募捐已于十日结束，特别募捐仍在进行中。估计总数可得三亿元左右。助委会目前已组成访问小组，调查申请助学金贫寒学生的家庭状况，以决定资助者名单。又，平市本届毕业生失业问题至为严重，北大毕业生因多未觅得职业仍留住宿舍中，为校方一再催促迁移，均感立足无地之苦。
    【新华社冀中三十日电】北大周作仁、向达两教授生活苦况，可以视俘蒋管区教授生活处境的一个缩影。据十七日天津大公报彭子冈“秋风里访教授们”一文报导，周氏任教北大十几年从未间断，亦未尝休假。他说他目前一家七口每月食米一百五十斤，就去了他全月薪水蒋币一百六十万元的半数。一个月薪水只够半个月用。现已完全恢复过去，昆明薪水买了米就不能买菜，买了菜就不能买衣服的苦况。他四个孩子中三个侥幸上了市立中学，小的再三请托人情进了市立小学，始幸而免于失学。生活的重担压得这个五十多岁的教授当得起“瘦骨嶙峋”四个字，周氏是教授银行货币学的他认为在现况下“改革币制是没有用的。这不过是为了计算法（蒋）币便当一点而已”。
    西域史权威向达教授，在北大任教八年，今年刚好轮到他休假，但为了偿还北大三百万元的债务和冬季用煤问题，不得不抛弃假期南下到研究院坐冷板凳，赚几文津贴使家属冬季不致冻馁。
