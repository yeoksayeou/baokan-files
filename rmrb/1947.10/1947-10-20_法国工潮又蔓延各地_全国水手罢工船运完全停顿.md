Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Paris dispatch: The strike of 3,600 subway and bus drivers, led by the General Confederation of Labor, has spread to other regions and industries since the 14th. After Parisian taxi drivers and carriage drivers announced a strike on the 16th, public service unions (including street cleaners and other municipal workers) are also in turmoil. According to a Reuters reporter on the 15th: "Paris observers fear that 1,800 workers in two departments of the state-owned Renault automobile factory will begin a sympathy strike on the 15th in support of the striking subway and bus workers, which would be a signal for a widespread strike throughout Parisian industry."

Following the strike of Parisian transportation workers, French merchant marine sailors broke out on strike at 7:00 AM on the 16th in all French and Algerian ports, and all shipping was declared to be at a standstill. The Lyon district construction workers' union passed a resolution on the 15th to strike, demanding a wage increase. Gas and electricity industry workers in France are also brewing a strike.

The central secretary of the Paris Regional Labor Federation, Hennaff, issued a notice on the 16th, scheduling a meeting for the 20th. In a statement, Hennaff fiercely criticized Ramadier's crime of "sabotaging the strike," and declared that the meeting may be asked to "take any decisions required by the situation." According to a United Press dispatch on the 16th: Some Parisian newspapers believe that this move is heading towards a general strike.

    接着巴黎交通工人的罢工，法国商船水手于十六日晨七时在全法国及阿尔及尔各港口爆发，一切船运宣告停顿。里昂区建筑工人工会于十五日通过罢工决议，要求增资。法国煤气及电力工业工人亦在酝酿罢工中。
    巴黎区工联中央书记恩那佛十六日发出通知，定于二十日举行会议。恩那佛在声明中猛烈抨击拉马第“破坏罢工”的罪行，并宣称：或将要求会议“采取形势所需要的任何决定”。据合众社十六日电称：巴黎某些报纸认为此举是走向总罢工。
