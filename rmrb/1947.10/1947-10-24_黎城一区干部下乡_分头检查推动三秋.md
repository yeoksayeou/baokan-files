　　Li Cheng First District Cadres Go to the Countryside
  　Divided Inspections to Promote the "Three Autumns"
    [This newspaper, Li Cheng News] On October 15th, cadres from the entire first district gathered for a preliminary summary of the autumn harvest. According to preliminary statistics from 34 administrative villages in the district, more than 22,000 mu of millet in the district have been completely harvested. In Xia Zhuang, Hong Jing, and 15 other villages, the corn has been picked and wheat planting is complete. The Xia Zhuang base point of seven main villages has plowed 2,237 mu of land. Based on the above achievements and the progress of harvesting and plowing, the district cadre meeting decided to conduct different inspections in the 34 administrative villages of the district, divided into three different regions and types, to promote the movement to a deeper level. The first type: villages where the autumn harvest and wheat planting started early and are now largely completed, and are now vigorously carrying out autumn plowing, such as Xia Zhuang, Hong Jing, and 15 other villages. The second type: villages where the autumn harvest is largely over, and only two-thirds of the wheat has been planted, and are now carrying out autumn plowing in combination, such as Dong Guan, Nan Cun, and 11 other villages. The third type: villages where the millet has been harvested, the corn is being picked, more than half of the wheat has been planted, and autumn plowing has just begun, such as Keng Dong and eight other villages. Different inspection requirements are put forward according to different regions and types: The first type of villages focuses on autumn plowing, combined with manure accumulation, and inspects wheat planting. The second type of villages focuses on wheat planting, combined with autumn plowing, and clears up the tail end of the autumn harvest. The third type of villages has many late crops, and the annual harvest is reduced more severely, so it is necessary to seize the opportunity to plant more wheat to make up for the poor harvest, continue to complete the autumn harvest and picking of corn, and carry out autumn plowing in combination. Now, after summarizing and exchanging experiences, the district cadres have gone to the countryside in groups, according to different regions and types, to carry out different inspections and promotion.

　　黎城一区干部下乡
  　分头检查推动三秋
    【本报黎城讯】十月十五号一区全区干部集会进行秋收初步总结。据全区三十四个行政村的初步统计，全区二万二千余亩谷，已完全割完，霞庄、洪井等十五个村已将玉茭撇完、麦改完。霞庄基点七个主村已垡地二千二百卅七亩。根据上述成绩及收耕程度，经区干部会议研究，全区三十四个行政村，决定按三种不同地区，不同类型，进行不同的检查，推动运动更深入一步。第一种类型：是收秋改麦开始早，现已大体完成，现正大力进行秋耕，如霞庄、洪井等十五个村。第二种类型：是收秋大体结束，改麦只改三分之二，现正结合进行秋耕的村，如东关、南村等十一个村。第三种类型：是谷已割完，玉茭正在撇，小麦一半多，秋垡地初开始的村，如坑东等八个村。按不同地区不同类型，提出不同的检查要求：一类村重心抓秋耕，结合积粪，检查改麦。二类村重心是抓改麦，结合秋耕，扫清秋收尾巴。三类村由于晚作物多，年景减收较重，要抓紧多改一部麦，弥补歉收，继续完成收秋撇玉茭，结合进行秋耕。现区干部总结交流经验后，已分头下乡，按不同地区不同类型，进行不同的检查推动。（任卿、经文）
