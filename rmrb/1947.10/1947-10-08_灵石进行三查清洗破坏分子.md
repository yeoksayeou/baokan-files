Taiyue, 5th (Our Newspaper) - Lingshi County, located in the border region of Yuebei, has launched a campaign of three checks to purge targets of struggle from various agencies and combat teams. In the first batch, forty-four individuals were purged. After checking the class background and ideology of all cadres and staff members in the county, it was clearly recognized that agencies cannot be consolidated and cannot adapt to the combat environment without purging the targets of struggle. After inspection, the Third District purged two people, including the landlord Fan Guoqing, who had infiltrated the liberated factory as an accountant. The intelligence station purged one landlord who was a scout. Units such as the Second District Armed Committee's rotational combat team, Zhang Wen's combat team, etc., also successively purged twenty-seven landlords who attempted to evade struggle. In the movement, all agencies paid attention to overcoming the tendency to simply expel the targets of struggle.

　　灵石进行三查清洗破坏分子
    【本报太岳五日电】岳北边沿区灵石县区各机关及战斗队开展三查清洗斗争对象，第一批清洗出四十四名，全县干部与所有工作人员经查阶级查思想后，明确的认识了不清洗斗争对象机关就不能巩固，不能适应战斗环境。三区经检查后，清洗了混进翻身工厂当会计的地主樊国清等二人，情报站清洗了地主侦察员一人。武委会二区轮战队张文战斗队等单位，亦先后清洗了二十七个企图逃避斗争的地主。各机关在运动中都注意克服以简单方式开除斗争对象的偏向。
