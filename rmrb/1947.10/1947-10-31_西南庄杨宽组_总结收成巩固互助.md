　　Southwest Village Yang Kuan Group
　　Summarizes Harvest and Consolidates Mutual Aid
　　[Report from Jinnan by our newspaper on the 28th] The Yang Kuan mutual aid group in Chengci Southwest Village has summarized its harvest and consolidated mutual aid. The group has a total of 159 mu of land and six laborers. Before mutual aid, each household had wasteland. After mutual aid, the weeds in the fields were cleared very cleanly, and the seedlings grew very well. Before mutual aid, each family only weeded the farmland twice, and the cotton only three times. After mutual aid, the farmland was weeded four times, and the cotton fields were weeded five times. For example, Yang Ji in the group originally did not have strong labor power and was also a trader at the county fair. He had wasteland every year. After participating in mutual aid, he still worked as a trader at the fair. The land was managed by the mutual aid group. According to the group's statistics, he earned 20,000 yuan in trading money, and the harvest was 2.8 dan more grain than when the land was barren. Yang Rong, a member of the group, cultivated 40 mu of land and harvested 4.5 dan more grain than usual. Group leader Yang Kuan cultivated 25 mu of land, including 5 mu of reclaimed wasteland, and harvested 5.2 dan more grain than in previous years. Zhao Qixiang and Wang Jian, two households in the group, cultivated a total of 45 mu of land and harvested 6.7 dan more grain. The whole group harvested a total of 49.2 dan more grain. After accounting, everyone happily said, "Mutual aid makes us unafraid of drought and flood. More weeding means more harvest."
