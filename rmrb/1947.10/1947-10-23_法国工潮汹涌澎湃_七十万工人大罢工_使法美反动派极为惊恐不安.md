Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Paris dispatch: The large-scale strike by French workers demanding wage increases has surged to 700,000 since the 14th, and continued through the 17th. The Ramadier government is attempting to quell the workers' strike struggle before the municipal elections on the 19th, but its methods of provoking and dividing the strike ranks have only resulted in a minimal 3,000 workers returning to work. As a result of the power plant workers continuing their strike, "as of the afternoon of the 17th, the French government had still been unable to operate any trains" (United Press). The authorities' negotiations with the labor unions for several days have also yielded no results due to Ramadier's insistence on his reactionary policies. However, the trend of the strike's development and its potential massive impact have greatly alarmed the French and American reactionaries. The United Press stated that the Ramadier authorities began to "adopt a tough stance on the evening of the 17th, preparing to use force if necessary." The agency also stated: American Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges declared at a press conference in London on the 17th: "The members of the committee have informed the French government that the speed and amount of American aid to France will be entirely dependent on whether France eliminates communism and stops the strikes." Therefore, Ramadier's "tough stance" is clearly executing the orders of his American masters. This disgraceful act by the American and French reactionaries, which insults the dignity of the French people, is estimated by the French press to potentially make a general strike of Parisian workers inevitable.

　　Over the past week, a massive wave of labor unrest has erupted in France. This labor unrest was triggered by a strike of more than 1,000 workers of the Paris Metro, who belong to an independent union. The French General Confederation of Labor immediately supported the strike with great sympathy. Workers in merchant ships, barges, taxis, carriages, docks, and even the nationalized Renault automobile factory in several major cities and ports have joined the strike. Sympathetic strikes by some coal and salt mine workers have also begun, and strikes by government public utility workers are brewing. As of the 16th, the number of strikers reached 700,000, cutting off urban transportation in Paris and other places, and completely halting navigation in major ports. This large-scale strike greatly shocked the French and American reactionaries. American imperialism has resorted to the despicable means of blatantly interfering in France's internal affairs, and has notified the French government: "The speed and amount of American aid to France will be entirely dependent on whether France eliminates communism and stops the strikes." Ramadier, who does not hesitate to sell out national interests, humbly accepted the orders of his American masters. On the one hand, when forced to negotiate with the labor union, he not only failed to meet the workers' legitimate demands for wage increases, but also played tricks, plotting to split the strike plan; on the other hand, he attempted to implement bloody suppression. However, the labor union and the striking workers continue to insist on the demand for a 15% wage increase. Hernefort, a member of the Paris Trade Union Committee, declared: "We will take any decision required by the situation." According to some morning newspapers in Paris, France may be heading towards a general strike.

　　Over the past week, the Soviet government has announced the results of the implementation of the production plan for the third quarter of 1947. Compared with the same period last year, industrial production increased by 25%, agricultural production increased by 58%, and consumer goods production increased by 16%. The Associated Press reporter also predicted that the Soviet Union would soon abolish the rationing system and increase the export of grain. This is an epitome of the Soviet Union's ever-increasing economic strength and the further improvement of the living standards of the Soviet working class.

　　Over the past week, in the discussions and votes of several committees of the United Nations General Assembly, the democratic front headed by the Soviet Union has won many political and moral victories, while the imperialist bloc headed by the United States has suffered heavy setbacks; "a considerable number of delegations refused to follow the United States and Britain in pursuit of hegemony" (TASS). On the issue of trusteeship, the Trusteeship Committee has successively passed several Soviet-proposed resolutions that are beneficial to the people of the colonies, dealing a blow to the colonial policies of imperialist countries. In the Social and Cultural Committee, the Soviet proposal to "prohibit the trafficking of women and children" was passed by an overwhelming majority. As for the so-called "Greek border dispute," the original proposal put forward by the United States to "condemn the interference of South, Bao, and A in Greece" had to be withdrawn automatically due to the continuous exposure and refutation by the Soviet Union. Although the US proposal to request the UN General Assembly to establish a "special committee" to supervise the so-called "Greek border dispute," etc., was passed by the Political Security Committee, when voting individually, as many as seventeen to thirty-eight countries refused to support the United States. When voting on Soviet proposals, one of the significant features was that the number of countries abstaining from voting increased. As Vyshinsky said to the representatives at the meeting: "Although you cannot openly raise your hands in favor, we are convinced that many of you believe in us in your hearts."

　　From the above situation, it seems that the international reactionary forces headed by American imperialism are becoming increasingly isolated.

### 法国工潮汹涌澎湃　七十万工人大罢工　使法美反动派极为惊恐不安

　　法国工潮汹涌澎湃
  　七十万工人大罢工
  　使法美反动派极为惊恐不安
    【新华社陕北十九日电】巴黎讯：法国工人为要求增资而举行的大罢工，自十四日以后，罢工工人已猛增至七十万，迄十七日止，仍继续坚持中。拉马第政府亟图于十九日举行市选前克服工人的罢工斗争，但其挑拨分化罢工阵营的方法，仅使为数极微的三千工人复工，由于发电厂工人继续罢工的结果，“法政府迄十七日下午止，犹未能使任何列车开动。”（合众社）当局与工会方面连日的谈判，亦由于拉马第坚持其反动政策，迄无结果。然罢工发展之趋势及其可能之巨大影响，已使法美反动派惊恐莫名。合众社称，拉马第当局于十七日晚开始“采取强硬态度，准备于必要时使用武力”。该社又称：美参院拨款委员会主任勃里奇十七日在伦敦记者招待会上宣称：“该会诸委员，已告知法政府，美国援法之迟速及多少，将完全以法国是否摒除共产主义及停止罢工而定。”因此，拉马第之“强硬态度”，显系执行其美国主子的命令。美法反动派此项有辱法国人民尊严的丑行，据法报界估计，或将使巴黎工人的总罢工不可避免。
    上周间，在法国又爆发了声势浩壮的工潮。这次工潮是以独立工会属下的巴黎地下铁道一千余名工人之罢工为导火线。法国总工会随即以莫大同情罢工来支援，若干大城市及港口之商轮、驳船、出租汽车、马车、码头，甚至国有化之雷诺汽车工厂的工人，都参加罢工，部分煤矿及盐业工人之同情罢工亦已开始，政府公共事业工人之罢工又正在酝酿中。迄十六日止，罢工人数达七十万名，巴黎等地都市交通遂告断绝，主要港口之航业完全停驶。这一大罢工，使法美反动派大为震惊。美帝国主义竟采取露骨干涉法国内政的卑劣手段，并通知法政府：“美国援法之迟速及多少，将完全以法国是否摒除共产主义及停止罢工而定。”不惜拍卖民族利益的拉马第，卑躬屈节接受其美国主子的命令，一方面在被迫与工会谈判时，非但不满足工人增资等之正当要求，反而玩弄诡计，蓄谋分裂罢工计划；另一方面则企图施行血腥弹压。但工会及罢工工人仍继续为增资百分之十五的要求而坚持斗争。巴黎工会中委赫那佛宣称：“将采取形势所需要之任何决定。”据巴黎某些晨报估计：法国可能走向总同盟罢工。
    一周来，苏联官方公布了一九四七年度第三季生产计划执行之成绩，与去年同期比较，工业生产增加百分之二十五，农业生产增加百分之五十八，消费品生产增加百分之十六。美联社记者并预卜苏联即将取消配给制，并将增加粮食之对外输出。这是苏联经济力蒸蒸日上及苏联工人阶级生活水准正更进一步提高之缩影。
    过去一周，在联大若干小组委员会的讨论与表决中，以苏联为首的民主阵线赢得了许多政治与道义的胜利，以美国为首的帝国主义集团，则遭受了重重挫折；“相当多的代表团拒绝尾随追求霸权的美英两国”（塔斯社）。在托管问题上，托管委员会先后通过了苏联所提有利于殖民地人民的数项议案，使帝国主义国家的殖民政策遭受打击。在社会文化委员会中，苏联“禁止贩卖妇孺”之提案，以压倒多数通过。至于所谓“希腊边境纠纷问题”上，美国所提“谴责南、保、阿干涉希腊问题”之原议，因苏联之不断揭露与驳斥而不得不自动收回。美国所提要求联大成立一个“特别委员会”以监督所谓“希腊边境纠纷”等议案，虽经政治安全委员会之通过，但在个别投票时，拒绝支持美国之国家竟达十七个至三十八个之多，在表决苏联议案时，其中显著特点之一，即放弃投票权的国家日益增多。这正如维辛斯基在会中向各代表所称：“虽然你们不能公开举手赞成，但我们确信你们之中有很多人的心里是相信我们的。”
    从上述情形看来，以美帝国主义为首的国际反动势力，正日益陷于孤立。
