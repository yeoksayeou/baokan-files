In this wheat loan program, the masses of Suanyu in the second district of Lingshi were allocated fourteen *shi* [approximately 1.4 tonnes], and they were all excited and said: The Eighth Route Army really cares about the people, and they can see whatever difficulties we have. Therefore, on the 13th, they organized more than 30 people to go to the district office to complete the formalities and go to the ×× warehouse to collect grain. The original plan was to return in three and a half days, but on the morning of the 14th, they rushed to × village in the first district and found Comrade Pei ×× of the county government. As soon as he met them, he said: Is it worth opening the warehouse for just your one administrative village? Wait! Come back when × village has more people. At this time, although the cadres and masses of Suanyu were anxious, seeing that it was time to plant wheat and prepare for the autumn harvest, they had no way to force him to open the warehouse, so they had to wait. As a result, they waited for most of the day. When they retrieved the grain, they encountered rain, and the dry food they brought was used up, and they were very dissatisfied. According to their calculations, they returned a day and a half late. If they could have taken the grain as soon as they arrived, they would not have had to get rained on along the way, and they would have wasted forty-five fewer workdays. During the busy farming season, forty-five workdays could have accomplished a lot. Comrade Pei ××'s bureaucratic attitude is really unacceptable. (Lingshi "Kill the Enemy and Overturn" Newspaper)

　　一抖官僚架子就要浪费民力
    在这次贷麦子中，灵石二区蒜峪群众分到十四石，他们都兴奋的说：八路军真是关心老百姓，咱们有甚么困难，都能看见。因此他们十三号就组织了三十余人，到区公所办好手续，去××仓库取粮，原计划回来得三天半时间，可是他们十四号早饭后赶到一区×村，找到县府裴××同志，他一见面即说：只你们一个行政村还值得开仓，等等吧！多来上×村再开。这时蒜峪干部群众们，虽然心里着急，眼看要种麦子又要准备收秋，但人家不开仓也无办法，只好等着，结果等了多半天，等他们取回粮食时，又遇着下雨，带的干粮吃完了，很不满意。这些人，共计算起来，迟回了一天半。如果能随去随取上粮的话，就不要在路上淋雨，还可少浪费四十五个工，在农忙时四十五个工就可作好多活计。裴××同志这种官僚主义态度是实在要不得的。（灵石“杀敌翻身”报）
