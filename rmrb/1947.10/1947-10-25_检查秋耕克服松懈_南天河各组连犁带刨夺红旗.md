　　Checking Autumn Planting, Overcoming Laxity
　　Nantiange Groups Link Plowing and Digging to Seize Red Flags

[Reported by this newspaper from Changzhi] After the Nantiange area of the Second District finished harvesting millet and corn, the mutual aid groups conducted in-depth inspections of the autumn planting plans. Most groups were busy with the autumn harvest and had not closely integrated it with autumn planting; only a few groups combined both. After discovering this problem, Comrade Cao Linshui, the Party branch secretary, convened a meeting of the masses on the night of the 12th to examine their original autumn harvest and planting plans. Several thoughts were revealed during the discussion: Meng Zhize said, "Life is tight during the autumn harvest. I just want to sleep during the night meetings. Reporting on work is just going through the motions." Wang Chouhong said, "Plans are made without inspection. The reports are empty talk. We do less and report more." Niu Gaixiang said, "Our group doesn't arrange things well at night. In the morning, we don't know whose land to work on. I want to harvest millet but am afraid of the wind. Zhize insists on cutting corn. He doesn't look at what's urgent and just harvests whatever he wants first, only thinking about himself. As a result, everyone goes to their own land." Some said, "It's not too late to turn the soil after we slowly finish threshing the millet and harvesting the beans. The weather is clear now anyway." After discussion, Cao Linshui made an accurate calculation of the manpower, livestock, and land of his brigade. Twenty-seven laborers could dig 25 mu of land in one day, and five plowing animals could plow 25 mu. By organizing women and children, they could complete the work by the eighth day of the lunar month. After his calculations, he dispelled everyone's complacency and laxity. They then set a two-day plan. Each group set its own two-day goals based on its manpower, prepared a red flag, and challenged each other every three days. The group that exceeded its plan would seize the red flag and be selected as a model. Wang Qihao proposed a vivid slogan: "Digging the land doesn't need skill, just strength!" "If you want to complete autumn planting, organize all and half laborers, everyone on the radio, organize to seize the red flag, launch a great autumn planting campaign, and everyone make great contributions." After this meeting, the Linshui Brigade organized 31 full and half laborers in one day and launched a great autumn planting campaign. Activist Wang Liuze said, "Autumn digging is good. It looks like a flower bud after being exposed to the sun. I dig three plots and move forward, you guys catch up behind. Digging finely and deeply, it's like arranging a chessboard, with chariots and horses not letting cannons pass." Wang Shuangzhu said, "Mutual aid is better than machines, it's really true. Digging 30 mu in one day is equivalent to six plowing animals." Wang Hai said, "Equal value and fairness, good rewards for activists. I earned eight points in the morning and threshed nine mu of millet in the afternoon." Linshui, Qihao, Chunyang, and Liudan earned seventeen points in one day, equivalent to eight and a half jin of rice. Wang Taishun, an eleven-year-old child, earned five points a day picking corn and beans. Linshui's mother harvested nine points of beans in one day. Song Mingze's wife dug nine points of land in one day, earning eleven work points and a 120 yuan bonus. Shuangze's wife, Sansuo, and Shuangcheng, three women, dug eight points of land in one night, each earning four work points. In two days, they organized 81 full male laborers, 23 half male laborers, 38 full female laborers, 11 children, 7 old men, and 20 livestock, digging 82 mu of land, plowing 102 mu, harvesting 744 mu of beans, threshing 207 mu of millet, and sowing 60 mu of wheat. On the night of the 14th, each group reported on their two days of work, all exceeding their plans. Democratic appraisal selected the Cao Linshui Brigade as a model. Each group also set a plan for the next three days to continue the autumn planting sprint and seize the red flag.

　　检查秋耕克服松懈
  　南天河各组连犁带刨夺红旗
    【本报长治讯】二区南天河在割谷刹玉茭大秋收完后，各互助组又深入的检查秋耕计划，大部都是忙于秋收，对秋耕没结合紧，只有少数组结合进行。发现这个问题后，支书曹林水同志于十二日黑夜召集群众检查自己原定的秋收秋耕计划，在圪扯中暴露出几种思想：孟智则说：“收秋生活紧，黑夜开会光想睡，汇报工作是应付公事。”王臭红说：“定出计划不检查，汇报说空话，做少报多。”牛改香说：“我们这组里黑夜不安排好生活，早起还不知上谁地，我想割谷怕刮风。智则非刹玉茭不行，不看啥紧先收啥，光以自己打算，结果都各上了自己地。”有的说：“慢慢把谷打完，豆子收完再垡地还不迟，天也晴好了。”经讨论后，曹林水即把自己大队土地劳畜力作了精确计算，廿七个劳力，一天可掘地二十五亩，五犋牲口犁二十五亩，再把妇女儿童组织起来，赶初八才能完成。经他计算后，把大家的自满与松懈思想打通，又定出两天计划，各组根据自己的劳力，都定出两天奋斗目标，准备了红旗一面，三天一挑战，那组超过计划，夺了红旗选为模范。王起好提出生动口号：“掘地没巧有力就好”。“要想完成秋耕地，全半劳力组织起，人人上广播，组织夺红旗，开展大秋耕，人人立大功。”经这次会后，林水大队一天组织起全半劳力三十一个，开展了秋耕大运动，积极分子王六则说：“秋天掘地就是好，一晒象花包，我掘三块向前进，你们后面赶得紧，掘得又细又深，好象排开棋盘阵，车马不让炮。”王双柱说：“互助起来顶机器，真不假，一天掘三十亩能顶六犋牲口。”王孩说：“等价又公道，奖励积极好，一上午赚了八分，下午还打了九亩谷。”林水、起好、春阳、六旦等人，一天赚了十七分，合米八斤半。王太顺十一岁的小孩，打玉茭拾豆子一天赚五分。林水娘一天割豆子九分，宋明则老婆，一天掘地九分赚工票十一分又得了一百二十元奖，双则妻、三锁、双成三个妇女，一晚掘地八分，每人赚工票四分。在两天中，共组织起男全劳力八十一个，男半廿三个，女全劳力三十八个，儿童十一个，老汉七个，牲口二十头，共掘地八十二亩，犁地一百零二亩，割豆子七百四十四亩，打谷二百零七亩，种麦六十亩。十四号黑夜，各组汇报了两天工作，都超过了计划，民主评议曹林水大队为模范，各组并定出后三天计划，继续突击秋耕夺红旗。
