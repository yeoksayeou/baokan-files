Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th. Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, recently published an article in the Northeast Daily titled "Chiang Bandit's Frenzy Before Death," accusing Chiang Bandit of shooting and killing Mr. Du Bincheng, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, and exposing his plot to arbitrarily distort and fabricate excuses to harm the entire Democratic League. The article begins by stating: "As Dong Xianguang cited, Yan Baohang, Yu Yifu, Han Youtong, Guan Mengjue, and myself are serving in the Northeast Liberated Area. Regardless of whether we are all members of the Democratic League, we are all from the Northeast." The article then sorrowfully recounts: "Since the Northeast was given to the Japanese invaders by Chiang Bandit, the people of the Northeast have been subjected to Chiang Bandit's jealousy and destruction while carrying out the national salvation movement in the interior. They endured suffering and fought bitterly for fourteen years." It also stated that after the Northeast was liberated by the People's Army and the Soviet Red Army, the people of the Northeast returned to their hometowns to reunite with their families, console their elders, serve their homeland, realize New Democracy, and improve the people's lives. "All of this is very natural and reasonable." The article then refuted Dong Xianguang's rumor that their return to work in the Northeast was instructed by the headquarters of the Democratic League, saying: "We did not return to the Northeast from the same place or at the same time. Moreover, it was during the time when Chiang Bandit was plotting a civil war and strictly preventing the activities of democrats. Therefore, each person's return was like Wu Zixu's flight, hiding their identity and disguising themselves. At this time, even if some of us were members of the Democratic League, how could we have received the mission of the Democratic League?" Furthermore, "The Democratic League originally had no restrictions on its members participating in political activities in any field. Now, Dong Bandit, under Chiang Bandit's secret orders, is using us as an excuse to harm the Democratic League. This is a well-known scheme. However, Chiang Bandit's defeat is certain. The more brutal he is, the more it will disintegrate people's hearts, and the more it will accelerate his inevitable demise."

　　After mourning the death of his old friend Du Bincheng, the article denounced Chiang Bandit for fabricating the fact that Du Bincheng, a member of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, was a Communist Party leader and shooting him, which was the most absurd and shameless act. It pointed out: "In the struggle before his death, Chiang Bandit will inevitably have a period of frenzied and inhuman brutality. We should work harder to support the front lines and accelerate the elimination of Chiang Bandit and his dog party in order to save our compatriots from this national disaster."

　　高崇民氏控诉杜斌丞被杀害
  　蒋贼疯狂迫害民主
  　必将加速走向死亡
    【新华社东北二十七日电】东北行政委员会副主席高崇民，顷在东北日报发表“蒋贼垂死前之疯狂”一文，控诉蒋贼枪杀民盟中委杜斌丞氏，并揭露其任意歪曲及捏造口实加害整个民盟的阴谋，该文首称：“有如董逆显光所举在东北解放区服务的阎宝航、于毅夫、韩幽桐、关梦觉及本人，姑无论我等是否尽为民盟盟员，但皆为东北人也。”该文继乃沉痛追述：“自东北被蒋贼送给日寇后，东北人士在关内进行救亡运动，备受蒋贼之嫉视与摧残，含泪忍痛，苦斗十四年。”并称：东北人在东北被人民军队及苏联友邦红军解放后返回故乡，叙骨肉之亲，慰父老之痛，为桑梓服务，实现新民主主义，改善人民生活，“全都是很自然很合理的事。”文中继驳斥董显光造谣说他们回东北工作，系民盟总部授意之无稽称：“我等回东北时非自一地，亦非一时，且正在蒋贼阴谋内战，严防民主人士活动之际，因此各人之归也无不如子胥之昭，隐姓埋名，化装潜行。当此之时，我等虽有为民盟盟员者，欲衔民盟之使命又岂可得乎？”且“民盟原无限制其盟员参加任何方面作政治活动的规定，今董逆承蒋贼密旨，以我等为口实，欲加害民盟，实所谓司马昭之心路人皆见。然而蒋贼败局已定，愈如此凶残，愈使人心瓦解，愈要加速其必然死亡之命运。”
    该文于痛悼其老友杜斌丞被害后，指斥蒋贼捏造明为民盟中委之杜斌丞为共产党负责人予以枪杀，实为最荒谬无耻的行为。并指出：“蒋贼在垂死之争，必有一阵疯狂无人性之残暴，我等应更加努力支援前线，加紧消灭蒋贼及其狗党，以挽救我全国同胞之浩劫。”
