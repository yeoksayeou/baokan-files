　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Prague dispatch: The smooth implementation of Czechoslovakia's Second Five-Year Plan has prepared excellent conditions for Czechoslovakia's economic development, enabling it to enter a higher level of planned economy. At the beginning of this month, Czech Prime Minister Gottwald proposed a new five-year plan for 1949-1953 at the State Planning Commission, following the two-year plan to be completed next year. The aim is to improve the living standards of the Czech people by 60% in 1953 compared to 1937, thereby further strengthening the alliance of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the middle class. According to Gottwald, the goals of the two-year plan have been 100% completed on schedule in the past nine months. At present, the total number of people employed in various industries across the country has reached 98% of that in 1937, and labor productivity is equal. Therefore, it is certain that the overall goal of the two-year plan to restore the highest pre-war industrial level will soon be achieved. The first Czech Five-Year Plan proposed by Gottwald has a total investment of 340 billion Czech crowns. The focus of the Five-Year Plan is on greatly developing Czechoslovakia's steel industry, heavy machinery industry, and chemical industry. According to regulations, steel production in 1953 must increase by 80% compared to 1948, heavy machinery must increase by 200%, total industrial production must increase by 50% or more, national revenue will increase by 40% to 50%, and the average income of the people across the country will increase by 100% compared to 1937. In order to ensure the continuous development of industrial production, the Five-Year Plan specifically stipulates the expansion of exports to countries with planned economies, so that the total value of exports to these countries in 1953 reaches 50 billion Czech crowns. Secondly, it will promote the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, increase agricultural production to 120% of the pre-war level, and cargo transportation will also increase by 40%. In addition, the plan stipulates that social and cultural undertakings will increase by 25% within five years, build 200,000 new houses and 2,000 large public buildings, and will greatly increase the production of daily consumer goods.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Prague dispatch: The Central Plenary Session of the Czechoslovak Unified Trade Union, which has been in session since the beginning of the month, opened on the 20th. The plenary session, representing 2 million members of the Czech Trade Union, passed a resolution to strive to support the policy of the National Front, resolutely oppose all elements attempting to restore old capitalism; and will ruthlessly expose and expel the scum who conspire to undermine the unity of the working class and the unification of the trade union movement. The plenary session solemnly pointed out that the Czech trade union movement only supports political parties that truly fight for the democratization of the country and the improvement of the living standards of the working people; and urged all political parties to strengthen the struggle against reactionary forces. The plenary session also declared its oath to fully support the five-year plan recently submitted by Prime Minister Gottwald to the State Planning Commission.
