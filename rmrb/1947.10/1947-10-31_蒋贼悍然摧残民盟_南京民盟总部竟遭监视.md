　　Chiang Kai-shek Villainously Crushes the China Democratic League
  　Nanjing Headquarters of the China Democratic League Actually Under Surveillance
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th] According to reports from various sources: Following the shooting of Du Bincheng and Wang Chubo (transliteration), responsible persons of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, and the large-scale arrest of members of the China Democratic League in Hankou, Shanghai, Beiping and other places at the beginning of this month, the Chiang bandit is now conspiring to further destroy the upper-level organizations of the China Democratic League in Nanjing, in an attempt to completely eliminate the China Democratic League. According to a TASS dispatch on the 25th: "Since the 23rd of this month, the headquarters of the China Democratic League has been under strict surveillance by secret police." According to Associated Press dispatches from Nanjing on the 23rd and 24th: Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman Dong Xian Guang has admitted that "he has ordered secret police to monitor the China Democratic League." The leaders of the China Democratic League in Nanjing have lost their freedom of action. Luo Longji refused to talk to reporters on the phone, and pointed out that there were secret agents eavesdropping on the phone. When Luo visited Stuart Leighton on the 23rd, two Chiang Kai-shek secret agents followed him to the gate of the US Embassy. The Associated Press pointed out that all these signs may be the prelude to Chiang Kai-shek announcing the China Democratic League as an "illegal organization" and destroying it.

　　蒋贼悍然摧残民盟
  　南京民盟总部竟遭监视
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据各方报导：蒋匪继本月初枪杀民盟西北总支部负责人杜斌丞、王楚伯（译音）及在汉口、上海、北平等地大举逮捕民盟盟员后，现又阴谋进一步摧残南京民盟上层组织，以期全部消灭民盟。据塔斯社二十五日电称：“自本月二十三日起民盟总部已被秘密警察严密监视”。另据美联社南京二十三、廿四日消息：蒋匪代言人董显光已承认“命令秘密警察监视民盟”，南京民盟领袖行动已失去自由，罗隆基拒绝与记者在电话中交谈，并指出有特务在偷听电话。罗氏于二十三日访问司徒雷登时，即有两名蒋匪特务跟踪至美大使馆大门。美联社指出，这种种迹象可能是蒋匪宣布民盟为“非法组织”而加以摧残的序幕。
