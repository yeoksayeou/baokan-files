Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: The internal war bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek flew to Shanghai on the 21st. Chiang's visit to Shanghai is reportedly related to the soaring prices in Shanghai and the fascist atrocities Chiang's bandits are carrying out there. According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 19th, quoting the Hong Kong China Business Daily, the Chiang bandit authorities' "terrorist actions against democratic groups and individuals are about to be launched in Shanghai. The special agent organization headed by Shen Qing (transliteration) held a secret meeting on September 27 to discuss the blacklist drawn up in Nanjing, which contains the names of 60,000 people, and 3,000 people will be arrested in Shanghai alone." The Central News Agency claimed that Chiang immediately summoned Chiang bandit Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen and Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu after arriving in Shanghai to "inquire" about the "security" and price situation in Shanghai. According to Central News Agency, Chiang flew from Nanjing to Qingdao on the 16th for "inspection," stayed in Qingdao for five days, and then transferred to Shanghai (Reuters reported that Chiang flew to Beiping on the 19th). An Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd stated that "the worsening military situation in Shandong (Chiang bandit)" made Chiang very anxious, and Chiang held a meeting with his senior generals in Qingdao to discuss this issue.

　　匪首蒋介石抵上海
  　布置法西斯大恐怖
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】内战匪首蒋介石已于二十一日飞抵上海。蒋之赴沪，据悉与上海物价暴涨及蒋匪正在上海进行之法西斯暴行有关。据塔斯社十九日电引香港华商报上海专电称：蒋匪当局“对付民主团体与个人的恐怖行动，即将在沪发动，以申清（译音）为首的特务组织，曾于九月二十七日举行秘密会议，讨论在南京拟定的黑名单，黑名单中列有六万人的姓名，仅在上海就要逮捕三千人。”中央社称：蒋抵沪后立即召见蒋匪上海市长吴国桢及警备司令宣铁吾，“垂询”沪市“治安”及物价情形。据中央社消息，蒋系于十六日由南京飞往青岛“视察”，在青停留五日后转抵上海（路透社曾报导蒋于十九日飞北平）。美联社二十二日消息称：“已呈恶化的山东（蒋匪）军事形势，”使蒋甚为焦急，蒋在青曾与其高级将领举行会议讨论此问题。
