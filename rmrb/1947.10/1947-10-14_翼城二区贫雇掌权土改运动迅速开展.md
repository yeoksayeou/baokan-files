[This report was transmitted by the Taiyue Bureau on the 12th.] The Yicheng Second District has mobilized hired and poor peasants to seize power, and the land reform movement has developed rapidly, with unprecedented momentum. In Guantou Village, the hired and poor peasant group compared their lives with those of the landlords, realizing that the struggle against the landlords was not thorough. They then organized their forces in the midst of grievances, united with the middle peasants, and launched a two-pronged offensive against the feudal forces, concentrating all the targets of struggle in the village for collective grievance sessions and collective struggle. When autumn planting was busy, they produced during the day and struggled at night. Conversely, in villages where the poor and hired peasants were not mobilized, the movement was only intermittent, even failing to break through. For example, the movement in Xiheping Village has not broken through; village cadres detained two targets of struggle but failed to initiate grievance sessions and struggles, allowing saboteurs to exploit loopholes, saying, "Cutting down one tree damages a hundred fruits." At the same time, in mobilizing the hired and poor peasants, it was fully demonstrated that only by uniting the broad masses could the movement be deepened. The hired and poor peasant group in Nanguantou Village united the masses of the entire village. Although all major decisions were made by the group, the general masses consciously executed their own discipline. Problems that had not been resolved for a long time in the village have now been easily solved. For example, the landlord An Guocheng attempted to use a knife to kill people, instigating some of the masses to beat to death An Juncheng, the standing committee member of the peasant association, an issue that could not be resolved even with the direct intervention of county and district cadres. However, after the hired and poor peasants rose up and fully followed the mass line, the landlord's ferocious face was immediately exposed, and the masses transformed the sham struggle into a genuine struggle. In Longhua Village, the most difficult problem to solve in the past struggle was the issue of caring for the families of military personnel, cadres, and martyrs. For example, Zhang Tao, the son-in-law of the landlord Zhang Jiaqing, worked in the Fifth District of Quwo and left some belongings in his father-in-law's house, which were confiscated by the masses. He then cursed, "What kind of peasant association is this? I have been mobilizing the masses from Shimin all the way to Quwo and have never seen such a peasant association! I will make sure you don't even take a strand of wool from me." This aroused the righteous indignation of the masses, who insisted on struggling against him, forcing him to admit his mistakes to the masses twice. Problems like these, which were most troublesome for the cadres, were all solved by the masses.

　　翼城二区贫雇掌权土改运动迅速开展
    【本报太岳十二日电】翼城二区发动雇贫掌大权，土改运动迅速开展，来势之勇猛，实属空前。贯头村以雇贫小组，与地主比生活，明了对地主斗争不彻底后，就在诉苦中组织力量，团结中农，重新向封建势力展开了两面进攻，将全村所有斗争对象都集中在一起，集体诉苦集体斗争；秋种忙碌时，则白天生产夜间斗争。相反的，未发动贫雇的村庄，运动只是忽起忽落，甚至突不破，如西河坪村运动一直突不破，村干部扣起两个斗争对象，却没发动起诉苦斗争，反使破坏分子钻空子说：“砍一树损百果。”同时在发动雇贫中，充分的试验了雇贫必须团结广大群众，才会使运动深入。南贯头村的雇贫小组，团结了全村的群众，一切大事虽由小组决定，而一般群众，皆自觉的执行他们自己的纪律，该村很久未解决的问题，现在也迎刃而解，即地主安国成，企图借刀杀人，煽惑部分群众，要打死农会常委安俊成之事，曾经过县区干部亲自下手，亦未解决，而雇贫起来之后，充分的走了群众路线，地主的狰狞面目顿时暴露出来，群众一变假斗争为真斗争。隆化村在一向斗争中，最难解决的是照顾军干烈属问题，如地主张加青之女婿张韬，在曲沃五区工作，寄放东西在其岳父家里，被群众没收了，他便大骂：“什么农会？我从士敏发动群众一直到曲沃，都没见过这样的农会！我叫你连我一根羊毛也拿不走。”激起了群众的义愤，非斗争他不可，迫使其不得不两次向群众承认错误。诸如此类最使干部头痛的问题，皆被群众解决了。
