Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th - Comprehensive Report:

The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and other countries firmly oppose the establishment of a "UN General Assembly Interim Committee." When the Political and Security Committee of the General Assembly discussed the U.S. proposal from the 14th to the 18th, the Hearst-owned "New York Journal-American" revealed that the purpose of the U.S. proposal was: "Marshall wants to use this institution to nullify the significance of the veto power used by the Soviet Union in the Security Council." Vyshinsky said at the meeting on the 14th: The intention of the U.S. proposal is to help warmongers, and the attempt is "to establish another institution above the Security Council to replace the Security Council." On the 17th, after exposing the U.S. purpose, Gromyko firmly stated that the Soviet Union resolutely opposed the U.S. proposal, "with no compromise whatsoever." The Ukrainian representative said on the same day that the U.S. and British groups would spare no effort to force the United Nations to accept their will, and the U.S. proposal was a blatant violation of the Charter. The Yugoslav representative emphasized at the meeting on the 15th that as a result of the Second World War, the democratic forces have become stronger, while the reactionary forces in the entire world have been greatly weakened. Then he asked the U.S. and its lackeys: Where do you intend to go from here? Do you want to force us to follow your policies with an "Interim Committee"? Your calculation is wrong, the situation has changed, and this plan will definitely not be implemented. During the debate, except for a few small lackeys such as Uruguay, Turkey, and El Salvador who openly followed the U.S., other countries such as Britain and France only dared to support the U.S. proposal hesitantly, and successively declared that they would accept it conditionally, and use various "amendments" to cover up the essence of the U.S. plan. The debate came to a temporary end on the 18th. Under the manipulation of the U.S., the Political Committee passed the proposal of the Australian representative, and handed over the case and its amendments to a subcommittee composed of 15 countries for research. The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia refused to participate in the subcommittee.

　　美国破坏联合国机构
  　遭苏南等国坚决反对
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】综合报导：苏联及捷、南等国坚决反对成立“联大临时委员会”。联大政治安全小组委员会自十四日至十八日讨论美国所提该案时，美国赫斯特系的“纽约日报”与“美国人报”供出美国建议之目的是：“马歇尔要利用这机构，把苏联在安理会中使用的否决权的意义化为乌有。”维辛斯基于十四日会中说：美国建议之用意在于帮助战争贩子，企图是“在安理会之上设立另一机构以代替安理会。”十七日，葛罗米钶于揭露美国目的后，强硬声明苏联坚决反对美国此项建议，“毫无妥协之可言”。乌克兰代表同日称：美英众团不惜任何手段要强迫联合国，接受其意志，美国的建议简直是明目张胆的违反宪章。南斯拉夫代表则于十五日会议上强调指出：二次大战的结果，民主势力更强大了，而整个世界的反动势力却大为削弱。接着他向美国及其喽罗们发问道：这样下去，你们打算走到什么地步呢？你们想以“临时委员会”来强迫我们奉行你们的政策吗？你们的算盘打错了，形势已经变了，这种计划决实行不了。会议辩论中，除了乌拉圭、土尔其、萨尔瓦多等几个小喽罗公开跟着美国跑以外，其他一些国家如英法之类代表，却只敢吞吞吐吐地支持美国建议，纷纷声明要有条件的接受，并以各色各类的“修正案”来掩饰美国计划的实质。辩论于十八日暂告一段落，在美国操纵下政治委员会通过了澳洲代表的提议，将该案及其修正案交由一个由十五国组成的小组委员会去研究。苏联与捷克等国则拒绝参加该小组委员会。
