　　The Shi Lailiang Platoon on the March
    Zezhong
    “I am a soldier of the Shi Lailiang Platoon, how can I fall behind and disgrace us!” This is what the soldiers of the Shi Lailiang Platoon say to encourage themselves.
    The heroic Shi Lailiang Platoon, during a certain march, carried a ladder more than three zhang long, in addition to their own belongings. Everyone's clothes were soaked with sweat, but no one said they couldn't walk anymore. On the road, Shi Lailiang noticed that the sick soldier Shang Liang was carrying two guns, and felt very sorry for him. He offered to carry them for him several times, but Shang Liang refused. Later, when Shang Liang went to relieve himself, Shi Lailiang snatched the guns, put them on his shoulder, and continued to carry the ladder. Shang Liang chased after him and said:
    “Platoon Leader, let me carry the guns, I guarantee I won't fall behind.”
    Shi Lailiang said: “Just keep up with the team, don't wear yourself out!”
    No matter what, Shang Liang refused to give up the guns, and finally snatched them back and carried them himself. The young soldier Ma Jigong's shoes were ruined when they got stuck in the mud. He walked more than ten li barefoot, closely following the team. When they arrived at their destination, someone said: "You're really something to walk barefoot and not fall behind!" He said: "I am a soldier of Shi Lailiang, how can I fall behind and disgrace us."
    There are few such teams in the world.
    After a certain battle, the Shi Lailiang Platoon was assigned to rest in a broken kiln. Suddenly a hen came in and lay down on a pile of straw. Shi Lailiang said to everyone: "The villager's hen is going to lay eggs, don't disturb it." He went outside to investigate whose hen it was, but couldn't find out. They stayed for five days, and the hen laid four eggs. On the day of departure, Shi Lailiang sent the four eggs to a neighbor's house, and said to the old lady: "We are leaving, please give these four eggs to our landlord, his family must be very poor, and selling the eggs can help them buy some grain." The old villager was very moved. As he walked out the door, he could still hear the villagers exclaiming in admiration:
    "Ah! There are few such teams in the world!"

　　在行军中的时来亮班
    泽忠
    “我是时来亮班的战士，怎能掉队丢人——这是时来亮班战士们激励自己的话。
    英雄时来亮班，在某次行军的时候，他们除背着自己的东西外，还抬着三丈多长的梯子，大家的衣服被汗水湿透了，但没有人说走不动。在路上，时来亮发现病号商亮背着两支枪，很过意不去，几次要替他背上，可是商亮却不答应，后来商亮解手时，时来亮抢过来背到肩上了，又抬着梯子走，商亮追上去说：
    “班长，你把枪让我背上，我保险掉不了队。”
    时来亮说：“你跟上队就行，不要把你累坏了！”
    商亮无论如何不肯给，终于把枪夺过来自己背上了。班里小鬼马积供的鞋子，被陷在污泥里弄坏了，他就赤着脚来紧跟着队伍走了十几里，到了目的地，有人说：“你赤脚走还不掉队真能行！”他说：“我是时来亮的战士，怎能掉队丢人哩。”
    世上少有这样的队伍。
    某次战斗后，时来亮班分配在一孔破窑里休息，忽然一只母鸡进来，伏在草堆上，时来亮对大家说：“老乡的鸡要下蛋啦，大家不要惊动它”，又到外面去调查是谁家的鸡，但没调查出来。他们到了五天，这只鸡就下了四个蛋。出发的那天，时来亮把四个鸡蛋送到邻居家里，并对老太太说：“我们走了，你把这四颗鸡蛋交给我们房东吧，他家一定很穷，卖了鸡蛋，也可贷些粮食。”老乡十分感动。当他走出门口时，还听见老乡们赞叹的说：
    “唉！世上少有这样的队伍！”
