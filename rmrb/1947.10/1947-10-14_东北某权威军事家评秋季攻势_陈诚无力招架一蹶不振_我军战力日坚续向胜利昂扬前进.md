Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 12th (Delayed dispatch) A certain military authority in the Northeast commented on the Northeast war situation, stating: In less than twenty days since the launch of our army's autumn offensive in the Northern Line of the Northeast battlefield, we have annihilated a total of 30,000 of Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng's regular troops and local forces in batches, capturing five enemy commanders, deputy commanders, and chiefs of staff. This brilliant achievement is matched by the large-scale counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army in the Southern Line. Looking at the Northeast battlefield since entering our army's autumn full-scale offensive, there are four significant characteristics:

\tCharacteristic one: As soon as our army's banners were unfurled, the bandit leader Chen Cheng was hit hard, his deployments were completely disrupted, giving this braggart, who claimed to "restore the advantage in the Northeast in six months," a resounding slap in the face. When our Jicha-Rehe-Liaoning People's Liberation Army in the Southern Line achieved a successful counter-offensive, it first thwarted Chen Cheng's first strategic plan to "open up" the Jinzhou-Chengde line and consolidate the Beining line, forcing him to hurriedly patch things up by transferring his so-called "mobile corps," the New 6th Army, to aid western Liaoning. However, in a blink of an eye, our Northern Line army launched a powerful offensive on both sides of the Changchun-Shenyang railway, sweeping across more than 400 miles of the railway line, taking more than twenty important towns, forcing Chen Cheng's strategic plan to become merely "haphazard resistance." For example, before the New 6th Army had time to "reinforce" western Liaoning, the situation on the Northern Line became critical again, so Chen Cheng hastily recalled the New 6th Army, but as soon as it was transferred near Xinmin, it was blocked by our attacking forces. At the same time, he ordered another so-called "mobile corps," the New 1st Army, to go south from Siping and open to Shuangmiaozipu, only to be beaten back to Siping in a rout. This completely messed up Chen Cheng's entire deployment. Under Chen Cheng's erroneous command, the Chiang bandits were beaten everywhere and fled in panic. Although the American cars ran very fast, they could not outrun the People's Liberation Army's legs. As a result, the 116th Division and the 390th Regiment of the 139th Division between Xifeng and Kaiyuan, and the 177th Division in Faku, were all annihilated and captured. When the Chiang bandits suffered successive annihilating blows from our Chen Yi and Su Yu's army on the East China battlefield, this Chiang bandit "Chief of Staff" always stubbornly insisted that his strategy was "correct" and criticized the errors of the battlefield commanders. On his recommendation, the Chiang bandits dismissed many senior generals, and also drove away Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming in the Northeast. But this time, the Northeast campaign was carried out by himself, implementing the strategic policy he personally formulated just over a month after taking office. What was the situation? Our army had only just begun to show its strength, and he was already in such a mess, panicking. This time, who will he dismiss? On this point, the Chiang Joint News Agency's assessment can be said to be correct: "Chen Cheng is just about the same as Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming, not necessarily any better."

\tCharacteristic two: The preliminary stage of the campaign shows that Chen Cheng is still following his master Chiang Kai-shek's "imperial edict" to adopt a policy of eliminating miscellaneous troops in the anti-people civil war. The vanguard in western Liaoning is the Provisional 22nd Division of the 93rd Army from Yunnan, the main force of the old Northeast Army and the 49th Army, and the Provisional 50th Division of the local forces. Those selling their lives on the central line are also the 116th Division of the 53rd Army of the old Northeast Army, and the 390th Regiment and the 177th Division of the local army of the 130th Division. His directly subordinate New 1st Army and New 6th Army have always been hiding in the second line, and as soon as they come into contact with our army, they are so frightened that they run away. The 195th Division of his direct line 52nd Army was also the first to hear the news and slipped away the fastest. Therefore, the unlucky ones are those miscellaneous troops, who have gone to their deaths for him, while Chen Cheng takes this opportunity to "adjust his deployment," using the name of "investigating responsibility for defeat" to wield his "knife," disbanding local troops, excluding personnel he does not like, and dismissing and detaining large numbers of people. The facts are so obvious, but I wonder if those miscellaneous troops who have suffered a lifetime of painful lessons, under these new and old wounds, will continue to be deluded and be enemies of the people, giving up their lives in vain for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war policy!

\tCharacteristic three: The Liberation Army is getting stronger and stronger, and the Chiang bandit army is getting weaker and weaker. Our army annihilated a large number of enemy troops at a very small price this time. Whether they are new or old troops, they fight like old hens picking food, each battle from the start of the general attack to the end of the battle takes only two hours. Moreover, they cleanly annihilate the bandit army at a cost of one to eleven or one to ten, and at least one to three; the bandit army is beaten to pieces, and eight cities are recovered in succession within three days, and the important officers of the bandit army's divisions, regiments, and battalions are rounded up. The rapid daily increase in our army's combat effectiveness has indeed made the bandit army tremble with fear. On the contrary, 25,000 of the bandit army laid down their weapons together, which shows how weak its combat effectiveness is and how disheartened it is. The US-Chiang news agencies have repeatedly tried to cheer up Chen Cheng, saying how the Chiang bandit's morale has been boosted since Chen Cheng came to the Northeast, which is just like farting!

\tCharacteristic four: Also the most important point is that as soon as our army's offensive was launched, it cut off all the supply lines of the Chiang bandits in the Northeast, the Beining Road and the Changchun-Shenyang Railway. Moreover, the important ports of Huludao and Yingkou, through which the US imperialists aid Chiang Kai-shek, are also under serious threat from our army. Chiang Kai-shek's personnel and the Central News Agency have been frantically shouting for days about "cutting off the connection between the Northeast Communist bandits and Shandong," which is a reverse statement of pretending to be fat by slapping one's face. The most ridiculous thing is that the American news agencies clearly know that Chen Cheng has suffered repeated defeats in the Northeast, but they are still promoting that our army's offensive may be "a flash in the pan," and that "fierce fighting near Kaiyuan has resulted in heavy casualties on both sides," which shows that the American imperialists are as extremely anxious as Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng about the cutting off of the US aid-Chiang route to the Northeast, and are hoping for a miraculous "victory" for the Chiang bandits. However, no matter how beautiful the dreams of Chiang and the United States are, and how earnestly they hope, the great people will continue to advance victoriously according to the established plan.

　　东北某权威军事家评秋季攻势
  　陈诚无力招架一蹶不振
    我军战力日坚续向胜利昂扬前进
    【新华社东北前线十二日电】（迟到）某军事权威人士顷评论东北战局称：北线东北战场我军，在秋季攻势发动后不到二十天中，就整批歼灭蒋陈匪正规军及地方部队共达三万人，俘敌正副师长参谋长五人。这一光辉的战果，正与南线解放军的大举反攻相互娩美。综观东北战场进入我军秋季全面攻势以来，有四个显著的特点：
    特点之一：就是我军旌旗初展，就打得匪首陈诚头破血流，部署完全紊乱，给这个说什么“六个月恢复在东北优势”的牛皮大王一记清脆的耳光。当我南线冀察热辽人民解放军反攻奏捷时，首先就使陈诚“打通”锦承线与巩固北宁线的第一个战略计划归于破产，逼使他急忙挖肉补疮，将其所谓“机动兵团”新六军调援辽西；但是不旋踵间，我北线大军又在中长路两侧全面展开强大攻势，纵横扫荡长（春）沈（阳）间四百余里铁路线，连下二十余重要城镇，使得陈诚的战略计划就只得变为“胡乱招架”。比如新六军还没有来得及“增援”辽西，而北线又大告吃紧，于是陈诚又仓惶召回新六军，但是才调到新民附近，却又被我破击大军拦住去路，他同时又命其另一所谓“机动兵团”的新一军由四平南下，开到双庙子，又被我打得抱头鼠窜，逃回四平，这样就把陈诚的整个部署搞得稀烂。在陈诚错误指挥下，到处挨打的蒋匪，更是兵荒马乱，仓惶逃命，尽管美国汽车跑得很快，但还是敌不过人民解放军的腿长，于是在西丰、开原间的一一六师和一三九师三九○团，及在法库的一七七师遂被全部歼俘。这位蒋匪“参谋总长”当蒋匪在华东战场连遭我陈粟大军歼灭打击时，他总是硬说自己战略是“正确的”，而斥责战地将领指挥的错误，在他建议下，蒋贼将许多高级将领撤职，在东北也撵走了熊式辉和杜聿明，可是这次东北的战役，却是在他走马上任刚刚一个多月，由他自己来执行他亲手制成的战略方针，情形又怎样呢？我军才初试锋芒，就杀得如此狼狈，慌做一团，这次不知他又该撤谁的职了？在这一点上，蒋联社的估计还可以说是对的，“陈诚比起熊式辉和杜聿明，半斤八两，不见得高明到那里。”
    特点之二是：由战役的初步阶段显示出，陈诚还是奉了他主子蒋贼“圣旨”采取要在反人民的内战中消灭杂牌军的政策，辽西打头阵的是云南的九十三军暂二十二师，旧东北军和四十九军的主力以及地方部队暂五十师；中线上卖命的，也是旧东北军五十三军一一六师，和一三○师的三九○团及地方军一七七师。而其直属部队新一军和新六军，则始终龟藏于第二线，与我大军一经接触，即吓得屁滚尿流而逃。其直系五十二军的一九五师也是得信最早，溜得最快。因此倒霉的即是那几支杂牌军，自去替他送死，而陈匪却借此来“调整部署”，以“追究战败责任”为名，大开其“刀”，解散地方军，排斥他所不喜欢的人员，大批的撤职和拘禁。事实是如此明显，可是不知那些受了一辈子惨痛教训的杂牌军，在这些新伤旧创之下，今后是否还要执迷不悟而与人民为敌，白白的去为蒋家匪帮卖国独裁内战政策送掉脑袋！
    特点之三是：解放军愈战愈强，蒋匪军愈战愈弱。我军此次以极小的代价，歼灭了大量敌军。无论新老部队，打起仗来都象老鸡挑食，每一战斗从开始总攻到结束战斗，都不过两小时。而且都是以一比十一、一比十的代价干净歼灭匪军，最少的也是一比三；打的匪军落花流水，三天内就相继收复八城，并且将匪军师团营的重要军官一网打尽。我军战斗力如此一日千里的提高，确使匪军心寒胆战。相反的，匪军两万五千之众一齐放下武器，这可以看出他的战斗力是如何脆弱，士气是怎样的一蹶不振。美蒋通讯社曾一再替陈诚打气，说自陈诚来到东北后，蒋匪士气如何振作，真是等于放了一阵臭屁！
    特点之四：也是最重要的一点，就是我军攻势初展，就将东北蒋匪的输血管北宁路和中长线全部斩断。而且美帝援蒋的重要港口葫芦岛和营口，也处于我军严重威胁下。蒋匪人员及中央社连日狂叫“截断了东北共匪与山东的联系”，这正是打肿了脸充胖子的反面说法。最令人好笑的，还是美国通讯社明明知道陈诚在东北连吃败仗，却还替他宣传什么我军攻势可能是“虎头蛇尾”，什么“开原附近激战，双方伤亡惨重”之类，说明着美国帝国主义对东北援蒋路线的被截断，是和蒋介石、陈诚一样的万分焦急，而盼望着蒋匪能有奇迹式的“胜利”。然而不管蒋美的春梦如何美丽，希望如何殷切，伟大的人民会按照既定的计划，继续向胜利的路上昂扬前进。
