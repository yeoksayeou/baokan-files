Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 5th: After annihilating over 20,000 Chiang troops in southwestern Shandong, the Chen-Su counter-offensive army, with overwhelming force, crossed the Longhai Railway on September 26th and entered the plains of eastern Henan, northern Anhui, and Jiangsu. In seven days, they recovered thirteen county towns, annihilated over 5,000 enemy troops, and achieved a glorious victory. Headquarters of the East China People's Liberation Army issued Public Announcement No. 25, stating: "Our counter-offensive army" is tasked with recovering the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Liberated Area and liberating the people of the provinces north of the Yangtze River. After annihilating the Chiang troops' 57th Division and other units, totaling over 20,000 men, in southwestern Shandong, our army crossed the Longhai Railway between Xuzhou and Kaifeng on September 26th. As of the 2nd, within seven days, our army advanced 300 miles on an 800-mile-long front, liberating the thirteen county towns of Weishi, Tongxu, Qi County, Sui County, Xiayi, Zhecheng, Shenqiu, Yanling, Fugou in Henan Province, and Taihe, Hao County, Guoyang, Mengcheng in Anhui Province; as well as dozens of important market towns such as Yimenji (northwest of Guoyang), Longshanji (northeast of Guoyang), Suixikou (northwest of Su County), Jieshouji (west of Taihe), and the Lieshan Coal Mine, while simultaneously cutting off the Jinpu and Longhai railways. The course of the operations is as follows: On the night of September 26th, our army captured the Neihuang Railway Station, annihilating over 700 puppet bandits. On the 27th, Qi County was captured, annihilating a Chiang security regiment and liberating Xiayi and Sui County. On the same day, Yejigang Railway Station (east of Lanfeng) was captured, completely annihilating four companies of Chiang's "Henan First Special Commissioner's Military Training Corps." On the 28th, Hao County was captured, annihilating a Chiang security regiment, capturing over 500 men, and annihilating four companies of a Chiang security regiment north of Xuefeng City (formerly Yongcheng). An enemy No. 803 fighter plane was shot down, and the pilot, Li Wuhao, and his co-pilot were killed. On the same night, the Lieshan Coal Mine south of Xiao County and the important town of Suixikou were liberated. On the 29th, Tongxu was captured, annihilating two battalions of Chiang's security regiment and the entire county security regiment, capturing over 500 men. On the same day, the army entered the West and South Gates of Su County. On October 1st, Taihe City and Jieshou Town were captured, annihilating three companies of Chiang's security regiment. On the same day, the three county towns of Weishi, Guoyang, and Mengcheng were liberated. On the 2nd, Fugou and Yanling were liberated. The Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Liberation Army coordinated operations, successively capturing the two county towns of Zhecheng and Shenqiu on the 28th and 29th, capturing over 700 Chiang soldiers. In total, our army annihilated over 5,000 local troops in seven days. Detailed battle results are still being investigated. Currently, within hundreds of miles in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, there are no traces of Chiang's troops, and millions of people are celebrating rebirth.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 5th: Frontline reporter Gang reports: The joy of the people of all classes in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu at seeing the light of day again and the grand welcome to the Liberation Army are described as follows: On the third day of the recovery of Xiayi City, the Liberation Army immediately opened warehouses to provide relief to the poor, distributing over 20,000 catties of military grain that the Chiang bandits had not had time to move, and freeing hundreds of people in the city who had been detained for service, allowing them to go home to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. These people had been forced to build city defense works day and night, without food, and were beaten if they resisted in the slightest, suffering all kinds of hardships. They were overjoyed by the sudden arrival of the Liberation Army. Two days before the liberation of Yuanjiazhuang in Yongcheng, they received a notice from the Chiang bandits in the city to prepare grain and mooncakes to await the "Central Army" to spend the festival in the village. With the arrival of the Liberation Army, the village avoided this loss of five million yuan in Chiang currency. Young and middle-aged men who had fled their villages to avoid being conscripted returned home to rush to harvest the autumn crops and prepare to plant wheat. The entire rural atmosphere has been transformed. A peasant woman from a village in Haozhou told the reporter: "In ten days, it will be time to draw this term's conscripts again. For every ten people guaranteed, if there is no one, you have to pay 1,000 catties of wheat as collateral, which is 17 million yuan (Chiang currency). You came just in time!" Another peasant woman, Wang, from another village in the county, said: "We have long heard that the Communist army is coming to collectivize the land (referring to land reform), and they don't want money, taxes, or conscription, and they support the poor to be masters of their own houses. We have been looking forward to it day and night, and finally, we have waited for our saviors." Whenever the reporter arrived at a village, he was met with crowds of people complaining about the pain of conscription. Some had already been conscripted to the point of extinction of their descendants. An old farmer from a village recounted that his only son had been conscripted for eight years and had not been heard from since. As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes. An old gentleman from Guoyang said: "In the past, Shi Jingtang recognized the Khitans as his father in exchange for being a local emperor, causing our Chinese nation to suffer hundreds of years of national subjugation and pain from foreign invasion. Today, Chiang Kai-shek is an emperor who serves American imperialism as his father, and his crimes are even greater than those of Shi Jingtang." A primary school teacher from Hao County said: "Chiang Kai-shek's conscription and grain requisition are truly two great evils. The treatment of primary school teachers is also extremely harsh. Now that the Liberation Army has come, everyone has hope!" (Attached picture)

    【新华社华东前线五日电】陈粟反攻大军在鲁西南歼灭蒋军两万余人以后，即以排山倒海之势，于九月二十六日横越陇海路，进入豫皖苏大平原，七天内克复十三座县城，歼灭匪军五千余名，获得光辉胜利。华东人民解放军总部发表第廿五号公开称：“我反攻大军”部为收复豫皖苏解放区，解放长江以北诸省人民，在鲁西南歼蒋灭匪整五十七师等部两万余名以后，九月二十六日在徐州至开封间跨越陇海铁路。截至二日止，七天内我军在八百里长宽正面前进三百里，解放河南省之尉氏、通许、杞县、睢县、夏邑、柘城、沈昂、鄢陵、扶清、安徽省之太和、毫县、涡阳、蒙城共十三座县城；及义门集、（在涡阳西北）龙山集、（在涡阳东北）睢溪口（宿县西北）、界首集（太和西）、烈山煤矿等重要集镇数十处，同时切断津浦陇海两大铁路。作战经过如下：九月廿六日夜，我军攻克内黄车站，歼伪匪七百余。二十七日，攻克杞县，歼蒋保安团一个营，并解放夏邑、睢县；同日攻占野鸡岗车站（兰封东），全歼蒋记“河南第一专署军训总队”四个连。二十八日，攻克毫县城歼蒋记保安团一个团，俘五百余，并在雪枫城（永城改称）北歼蒋记保安团四个连，击落敌人八○三号战斗机一架，驾驶员李武毫等二人跌毙。同日晚解放萧县南烈山煤矿及重镇睢溪口。二十九日，攻克通许，歼蒋保安团两个营，及县保安团全部，俘五百余；同日，攻入宿县西关南关。十月一日，攻克太和城界首镇，歼蒋保安团三个连；同日并解放尉氏、涡阳、蒙城三县城。二日解放扶沟、鄢陵两县城。豫皖苏解放军配合作战，于二十八、九两日先后攻克柘城、沈邱两县城，俘蒋军七百余。总计我军在七天中共歼敌地方军五千余名。详细战果正清查中。现豫皖苏纵横数百里以内，已无蒋军踪迹，千百万人民欢庆苏生。
    【新华社华东前线五日电】前线记者岗报导：豫皖苏各阶层人民重见天日的喜悦与热烈欢迎解放军之盛况称：收复夏邑城之第三天，解放军立即开仓济贫，将蒋匪搜刮未及搬走之军粮两万余斤分给群众，并将城内数百名被拘禁服役的群众解放回家，欢度中秋佳节。彼等曾被迫日夜修筑城防工事，不给饭吃，稍有反抗即遭鞭打，受尽种种苦难。对解放军之突然到来，惊喜万分。永城袁家庄于解放前两日犹接城里蒋匪的通知，要准备粮食月饼等候“中央军”到庄上过节。解放军一到，该庄即避免了此五百万元蒋币的损失。各村为躲避抓丁而逃亡在外的青壮年纷纷回家赶收秋禾，准备种麦。整个农村气象，已为之一片。毫州某庄一农妇告记者称：还有十天，就又该抽这期壮丁了，每保十个，没有人就得缴一千斤小麦作抵，合一千七百万元（蒋币）。你们来得真巧！”该县另一村农妇王氏说：“俺老早就听说共产党军队来了，就要共土地（按指土地改革），又不要款、不要税、不抓壮丁，扶持穷人当家。俺们白天盼，夜里盼可把救命恩人盼来了。”记者每至一村即遇群众纷纷诉说抓丁痛苦。有的已被抓绝了后代。某村一老农诉说他的独子已被抓去八年，至今查无音信。说着眼泪夺眶而出。涡阳某老先生说：“过去石敬塘认契丹做父换得作土皇帝，造成我华族数百年受外族蹂躏的亡国惨痛。今天蒋介石做美帝国主义的儿皇帝，其罪恶比石敬塘更大。”毫县某小学教员说：“蒋介石抽壮丁征粮，实为两大恶政。对小学教员的待遇，也是刻薄万分。这一下解放军来了，大家都有指望！”（附图片）
