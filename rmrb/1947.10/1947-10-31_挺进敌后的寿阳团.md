　　The Shouyang Regiment Penetrates Behind Enemy Lines
　　·Zi Hong·
　　On the 5th of this month, the Shouyang Regiment advanced to Bailintou near Shitie Town, the enemy's heartland. The "Struggle Corps" in the village fled upon hearing the news. The regiment immediately occupied the Bailintou stronghold and, in the afternoon, attacked the enemy stronghold of Xingzhi, located five li away from Shitie. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy fled like rabbits. Within one day, two white spots, Bailintou and Xingzhi, were driven out. When the masses in villages near Bailintou, such as Xizitou, Liujiazhuang, and Yujiazhuang, saw our army arrive, they rushed back to their villages to harvest. The troops, together with local cadres, mobilized the masses to confiscate and distribute the property, grain, grapes (one of the main products of the area), pears, and other fruits of the traitorous landlords. The masses and village cadres all said, "Our troops are for the poor. The 'Struggle Corps' was still protecting the landlords yesterday. Today is our day. The dogs have robbed us clean; today, we will let them taste our power!"
　　On that day, the masses carried, shouldered, and hauled, extremely tense and excited. In a landlord's cellar, they even found 200 silver dollars. The masses breathed a sigh of relief and said: This winter, we won't have to starve if we flee. The autumn crops of landlords in villages like Liujiazhuang and Kuoziou were mostly harvested by the masses. At that time, the slogan we put forward was: "Distribute boldly, harvest quickly, get a little is a little, and avoid starvation this winter." The masses said angrily, "If we don't get it, the revenge team won't let us live. What are we afraid of!" The vigorous struggle to divide the autumn harvest lasted for three days. Men handled the grain, while women and children handled the fruits and dates. A total of fourteen landlords' autumn harvests were distributed, and the property of five landlords and local tyrants was confiscated.
　　Comrades from all units automatically carried out large-scale counter-offensive propaganda, spreading the news of the counter-offensive victory everywhere and writing slogans about the counter-offensive and the distribution of autumn harvests, land, and land reform. In half a day, most of the reactionary slogans of the Yan bandits in the area were washed away and replaced with brand-new slogans. One hundred and seventy-five slogans were written in three villages. Many comrades actively searched for white soil, carried basins, and looked for brushes. They were writing and reciting, competing with each other to see who could write the largest, most genuine, and best slogans. Soldiers, squad and platoon leaders, quartermasters, clerks, sanitation chiefs, medics, staff officers, and secretaries participated in the slogan-writing movement. The most active among them were comrades Guo Fengyi, Zhao Shengtang, Li Xufeng, Wang Ziming, Yue Shuanfu, Shi Hailiang, Cui Cunrang, Shi Shengde, Wang Daoyun, Zhao Dixing, and Ma Jinyun.
　　The troop's "water-filling campaign" was also launched in this newly recovered area. On the same day, Wang Chenghu, Lü Buke, and Li Siniu from the first squad of the seventh company carried six loads of water for the villagers of Bailintou despite being extremely tired. The moved villagers said, "I've lived for so long and never seen soldiers like this, even carrying water for the people!" The troops were strict in discipline and did not take a single needle or thread from the masses. When it was time to leave, the masses repeatedly pleaded for the troops to stay longer and refused to let them go.

　　挺进敌后的寿阳团
    ·资红·
    本月五日，寿阳团挺进至敌人心腹区什贴镇附近柏林头，该村“奋斗团”闻讯逃走，当即将柏林头据点占领，下午向距什贴五里地之兴治敌据点进攻，该敌见势不佳又象兔子一样的逃跑了。一天内即驱逐了柏林头兴治两个白点子，于是柏林头附近村庄析子头、刘家庄、于家庄等村群众见我军到达后，急忙赶回村里抢收，部队协同地方干部发动群众没收分配奸霸地主的财产粮食和葡萄（该地主要产物之一）梨子等水果。群众和村干部都说：“咱这队伍是为穷人的，‘奋斗团’昨天还保护着地主呀，今天就是咱们的天下了，狗日们可把我们抢光了，今天也叫他试试我们的厉害吧！”
    这一天群众担的扛的挑的，紧张兴奋极了，在一家地主家里地窑中还搜出了二百元现洋，群众吐了一口气说：今年冬天逃出去也不至于挨饿了。刘家庄阔子头等村地主的秋禾大部被群众收割了，当时我们提出的口号是：“大胆的分，迅速的收，搞一点是一点、搞下今冬不受饿。”群众愤愤的说：“咱不搞，人家复仇队也不让咱活，怕什么！”轰轰烈烈的分秋斗争一直搞了三天，男人们搞粮食，女人小孩搞水果枣子，共分了十四家地主的秋，没收了五家地主恶霸的财产。
    各单位同志都自动的进行大反攻宣传，到处向群众讲反攻胜利消息，到处写反攻和分秋分田土改的标语，半天时间内，把阎匪在该处的反动标语大部刷洗掉了，换上了崭新的标语。三个村即写标语一七五条，很多同志积极找白土，端盆子，找刷子，念着写着，互相比赛者谁写的大，写的真，写的好，参加写标语的有战士、班排长、事务长、文书、卫生长、卫生员、参谋、干事，确实形成了一个写标语运动，其中最积极的要算：郭风仪、赵升堂、李徐峰、王子明、岳拴富、史海亮、崔存让、史生德、王道云、赵地新、马锦云等同志。
    部队的满缸运动，也开展到了这新收复区，当天，七连一班王成虎、吕布科、李四扭等同志在极端疲劳情况下，给柏林头老乡担水六担，感动的老乡说：“我长了这么大没见过这当兵的，还给老百姓担水哩！”部队纪律严明，未犯群众一针一线，临走时群众再三挽留多驻几天，不让队伍走。
