　　Yuluoshan Brigade Refines Wheat Planting
　　Implements Plowing Twice and Harrowing Six Times
　　[Jinan News, Hebei, 5th] In Xishagaoling Village, Jixian Sixth District, the Yuluoshan Brigade planted 400 mu of wheat in three days by plowing twice and harrowing six times with men and women working together. Yuluoshan took the lead, planting wheat on 16 mu of his 26 mu of land. When he was plowing the stubble, the women and children would gather firewood and grass. After they cleaned it up, he would harrow it again to rake up any remaining grass. He applied three cartloads of fertilizer per mu, harrowing it before covering, and then harrowing it three more times. This allows the wheat to sprout well and prevents mole crickets. His team all planted wheat first and then threshed. Men, women, and children were all busy planting wheat. Qi Jinbang, the director of the Farmers' Association, wanted to compete with the labor hero in plowing, harrowing, fertilizing, and comparing the wheat harvest next year. He also plowed his four mu of millet twice and harrowed it six times, applying three cartloads of manure per mu. At the same time, under the leadership of the labor hero, each team planted 72 mu of wheat and hoed 29 mu of stubble for eight families of revolutionary soldiers. Liu Fuke and Fu Dacui planted six mu less due to a lack of wheat seeds. Yuluoshan borrowed a dou of wheat seeds from his home for each of their families, and they planted more than seven mu. The whole village organized 98 households with over 1,400 mu of land. Before planting wheat, they were afraid they could not plant much because they had few livestock and little fertilizer. After a detailed division of labor during the autumn harvest, there was not a single idle person. They also proposed "plant wheat first, thresh later, don't waste livestock power, women push the millstone." The Yuluoshan Brigade's cooperative also lent wheat seeds and sold more than 40 cartloads of manure from the flour mill at a low price to households that lacked fertilizer. After solving these difficulties, the entire mutual aid brigade was able to plant 523 mu of wheat (originally planned to plant 350 mu, planting an additional 170 mu). After three days of concentrated effort, 400 mu of wheat have been sown.

　　郁洛善大队精细种麦
  　实行耕二耙六
    【本报冀南五日电】冀县六区西沙高岭村耕二耙六，男女齐下手，郁洛善大队三天种好麦子四百亩。郁洛善首起带头，二十六亩地，种上麦子十六亩，他耕茬子时，妇女儿童就拾柴拾草，拾干净后，他再耙一次，将拾不净的草给耙光。每亩上好三车肥，耙了再扣，扣好再耙三次，这样土地麦子好生苗，又能防蝼咕。他组都是先种麦，后打场，男女老幼都为种麦忙。农会主任齐金榜要和劳英比耕耙、比上肥、比明年收麦多少，四亩谷子也耕二耙六，每亩上粪也有三车。同时在劳英领导下，各组给八户抗属种上麦子七十二亩，锄好二十九亩茬子。刘福科、傅大翠因麦种缺乏，少种了六亩，郁洛善也从家借给他们家各一斗麦种，他俩又多种了七亩多。全村共组织起来九十八户，有地一千四百余亩，在种麦前，因牲口少肥料少怕不能多种，经秋收时详细的分了工，没有一个闲人，又提出“先种麦晚打场，不浪费牲口力，妇女推碾磨。”郁洛善大队的合作社又借给麦种，又把粉坊的四十多车粪贱价卖给没肥料的户，经过解决这些困难，全互助大队能种麦五百二十三亩（原计划种麦三百五十亩，多种了一百七十余亩）。经过三天突击，已有四百亩麦子下完种。
