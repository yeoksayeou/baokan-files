　　Armed Forces in Shanxian and Yutai Districts
  　Advance as the Enemy Advances, Persist in the Region
    [Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, dated 10th] During the 20-day seesaw battle in Shanxian and Yutai Counties, the district armed forces actively mobilized in coordination with the main forces, flanking and intercepting the enemy, achieving remarkable results. On August 14th, when the enemy's reorganized 3rd Division (previously annihilated in the Dayang Lake Campaign but since replenished) passed through villages in our Taihang and Chongfu Districts, our district cadres dispersed to persist in the region. The militia in the Dibei sub-district adhered to the principle of "advance as the enemy advances," immediately maneuvering into the enemy's rear, capturing enemy stragglers. On the same day, they captured two enemy soldiers, seized one rifle, and one warhorse, and also obtained 2,000 rounds of artillery shells. Taihang District did a good job in establishing joint defense and organizing mass intelligence work. District cadres also carried out propaganda near the villages where the enemy was stationed. In Chongfu District, immediately after the enemy left, they went into the villages to investigate the losses of the masses. On the third day, they convened a meeting to elect persistence models and anti-enemy struggle heroes. On the fourth day, they held a memorial service for the martyred masses and then immediately shifted to land reform and revenge. On August ×th, when the enemy stationed in Shanxian County invaded our Laihe and Hetuan Districts, the Laihe District's squadron immediately conducted frontal interception. A Hetuan District messenger ambushed from the side, killing three enemy soldiers. The next day, the enemy parachute troops and local bandits invaded again. The armed forces of these two districts intercepted and harassed them everywhere, and the enemy was blocked near Shanxian County and dared not advance. From September 1st to 4th, the enemy parachute troops launched a large-scale invasion of various districts. Our county's large detachment and the district teams formed harassment groups, universally harassing at night, causing the enemy to fire guns and cannons all night long, not daring to leave the village a single step. On the 4th, the enemy fled back to Shanxian County. Our district armed forces pursued in separate routes. The secretary of the Tanglou sub-district committee led 12 members of the security team, pursued the enemy, and obtained a vehicle and a blanket.
