　　Cao Village Poor Peasants Jointly Buy Cattle
　　[Report from Jilu豫 (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) on the 13th of this month] In Cao Village, the first district of Renping County, there are nine mutual aid teams. The fourth mutual aid team had a fat ox. After everyone discussed it, Cao Shangben, Cao Guangquan, and Cao Lianjiang bought it together for 40,000 yuan. This 40,000 yuan was allocated as follows: 15,000 yuan to the poor peasant Cao Lianting, 10,000 yuan each to Jiang Xizhi and Cao Shangcheng, and 5,000 yuan to the middle peasant Zhang Hongcheng. Jiang Xizhi, Cao Lianting, and Cao Shangcheng added a little money to their allocations and jointly bought another ox for the team. The three of them said, "If our team has more livestock, we can increase production. Even if we have to use a livestock for carting and supporting the war effort, our team's work won't be delayed." Influenced by them, Zhang Hongcheng also bought a donkey and put it in the team. He said, "If everyone is united, our production will definitely be good." The women in the team strongly support everyone's actions, and they automatically put together the money they earned from spinning thread and bought an ox for the team. They said, "This way, our team can send a big cart to the front, and we still have livestock at home to use, so our work will never be delayed." Now, the team's production is very active. Cao Guangyin, a backbone poor peasant, takes the lead in everything and puts the money he earns from blacksmithing into the team. Everyone in the team says he leads well. Seeing that the fourth team is doing well, the other teams are also buying cattle. Currently, the entire village has newly bought twenty cattle. Everyone feels that no matter how much support they give, it won't delay production. The women said, "As long as we have cattle, you strong men can go to the front, and we and the old folks can still produce and guarantee that we won't delay the work." The deputy leader of the militia squad said, "This way, the work at home won't be delayed, and we are all very willing to go to the front."
　　[Another report] After hearing the news of the counter-offensive, the masses in Zhangyi Village happily held meetings to discuss their understanding of the counter-offensive. Everyone expressed their courage and determination to make contributions in the great counter-offensive. On the one hand, they will resolutely eliminate the landlord class, and on the other hand, they will step up production to complete war support tasks. When discussing production issues, they reviewed the past mutual aid, where honest people suffered losses. Therefore, they made new rules and elected Chang Xianlai and four others to form a production committee. The masses in the entire village, except for landlords and rich peasants, freely formed 45 mutual aid teams, planning to plant 3,500 to 4,500 acres of wheat. They formulated the following measures: military dependents and families of martyrs and those on duty have priority when doing various jobs; the fields of orphans and widows are guaranteed not to be barren, and they are provided with meals or a small amount of wages when doing work for them; livestock and vehicles are used in a unified way, and poor peasants without livestock are helped with forage; young women, except for special circumstances, all participate in labor. Currently, the masses in the entire village are in high spirits, and have plowed more than 600 acres of land, preparing to plant early-maturing wheat. Other crops will be harvested and planted immediately as they ripen, ensuring that nothing is delayed.

　　曹庄贫农合伙买牛
    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】荏平一区曹庄，全村九个互助组，第四互助组把果实牛一头，大伙一商量，由曹尚本、曹光全、曹连江三人买上，共拿出四万元，这四万元批给贫农曹连庭一万五千元，姜西职、曹尚成各一万元，批给中农张鸿成五千元，姜西职、曹连庭、曹尚成三人批来的钱，添补一点，又合买了一头牛放在组里，他三人说：“咱组里牲口多了可增加生产，就是摊着一个牲口拉车支应战勤，咱组里的活也耽误不了。”在他影响下，张鸿成也自己买了头驴，放在组里，他说：“大伙都一气，咱的生产准搞好了。”这组里的妇女们很赞成大家的做法，就自动把纺线赚来的钱合在一起，也买了一头牛放在组里，她们说：“这么着，咱组里出一辆大车上前方，家里还有牲口使，咱的活一辈子也耽误不了。”现在这组里生产很积极，曹光银是贫农骨干，一切起带头作用，把打铁赚的钱也放在组里，全组都说他领导的好。别的组看着四组搞的好，也都买起牛来，现全村已新买牛二十头，大家都感到支差再多也不耽误生产，妇女们说：“只要有牛，你们壮丁都上前方，俺们和老头们也能生产，保证不误活。”民兵小队副都说：“这样家里活不耽误，我们都很愿意上前方。”
    【又讯】张仪村群众听了反攻的消息，都欢天喜地开会讨论对反攻的认识，一个个表示了勇气和决心，要在大反攻中立功，一方面要坚决消灭地主阶级，另方面要加紧生产完成战勤任务。讨论生产问题时，检讨了过去互助，过去是老实人吃亏，于是又订了新规矩，选出常先来等五人成立生产委员会，全村群众除地主富农外，自由结合成立四十五个互助组，计划种麦三千五百亩至四千五百亩，制订办法：做各样活时，军工烈属及出差者有优先权；孤寡的地保证不荒，给他们做活时管饭，或者拿一小部分工资；牲口车辆统一使用，贫农没牲口帮助草料；青年妇女除特殊情形者外，都参加劳动，现全村群众情绪都很高涨，已犁地六百多亩，准备种头耩麦，其他地庄稼熟了随割随种，保证不耽误事。
