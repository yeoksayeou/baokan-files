(From our newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 26th) The local armed forces of the Fifth Sub-district, in coordination with the heroic attacks of our East China Field Army, have achieved brilliant results in the past half month. On September 22nd, when the enemy's 11th Division attacked our local armed forces, we encountered the enemy in Zhengzhuang and killed eight enemy soldiers. On the night of September 24th, our local armed forces sabotaged three miles of the Longhai Railway, blew up a railway bridge, and burned more than a thousand sleepers. On October 3rd, over 700 enemy security troops under Li Meicun and Cao Yongnian, along with a mass meeting in Wu Lou, were attacked by our troops upon receiving the information, and the enemy was repelled. On the same day, the Independent Regiment, which had penetrated into Dongyuan, eliminated the enemy's "Special Training Class" under Li Yuetang, capturing 25 enemy soldiers. On the same day, our Qimin Brigade, in coordination with the main force, ambushed the enemy at Zhao × Lou, killing and wounding 13 enemy soldiers, and seizing over a hundred rifles and over a hundred rounds of ammunition. On the 4th, the Qimin Brigade, braving the rain, jointly attacked the bandit Zhang Shengtai's troops, capturing 14 enemy soldiers, killing one, and seizing five rifles, one pistol, and 216 rounds of ammunition; on the same day, the enemy who was looting grain at Beikou in Dongyuan was ambushed by us, killing and capturing 13 enemy soldiers, seizing four rifles, 300 rounds of ammunition, and thousands of kilograms of rice. On the 5th of this month, a unit of our local armed forces, with swift action, jointly attacked the bandit Zhang Shengtai's troops at × Miaozhuang, killing and capturing 15 enemy soldiers, seizing 15 rifles, one light machine gun, and 200 rounds of ammunition. On October 6th, our local armed forces raided the enemy at Huigangji, Cao County Security Brigade, immediately killing and wounding 30 enemy soldiers. At dawn on the 8th, our local armed forces took the initiative to insert themselves into the northern side of the Longhai Railway, sweeping away local bandits. In Yangditou village, we captured 38 enemy soldiers, eight large guns, and 500 rounds of ammunition with just one burst of gunfire. The Heze Brigade, active near Heze, captured and killed 54 enemy soldiers in eight days. Our Fifth Sub-district's local armed forces, in the state of a great tug-of-war guerrilla warfare, are growing stronger and stronger, and have now begun to advance into the enemy's heartland.
