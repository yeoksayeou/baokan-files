　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Belgrade Dispatch: The Yugoslav National Front held its Second Congress the week before, which concluded on September 28th. The congress elected Marshal Tito as Chairman of the National Front, along with six vice-chairmen; it also elected a secretariat of seven people, with Juyo Vick as General Secretary. The congress passed a resolution stating: "The National Front is a new type of democracy, a true representative and servant of the people." It called for expanding the activities of grassroots organizations of the National Front and strengthening the political education of members of the National Front and the general working people. The congress unconditionally supported a peace-loving foreign policy, the aim of which is to guarantee world peace on the basis of the United Nations Charter and to develop friendly relations with all countries. The congress denounced the false accusations against Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania, and pointed out that the countries blaming the above three countries should be held responsible for the dictatorial civil war in Greece. The congress expressed the desire that the world's democrats unite all forces to save mankind from the imminent danger. The congress expressed its sincere condolences and sympathy to all national liberation movements and fighters for the freedom and independence of the people of the world.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. TASS Belgrade, 30th Dispatch: Marshal Tito, in a speech at the Second Congress of the Yugoslav National Front, stated: "The current international situation not only requires us to unite all forces within the country that hope for peace and progress, but also requires us to unite and unite all progressive people in the world to fight for peace, to fight against those who clamor and provoke war, and to fight against those who are creating the greatest disaster in human history. I believe that representatives of all democratic forces will soon unite to discuss how countries should cooperate and how to fight to prevent new war disasters." Tito pointed out: "International reactionary forces, led by the American financial magnates, are trying to achieve their imperialist goals by means of fascism. But no matter how unprecedentedly widespread fascism is developing in the United States, we firmly believe that the international reactionary forces will once again suffer a miserable defeat." Tito emphasized: "The Yugoslav National Front is not only extremely important in domestic life, but also a strong factor in the struggle for peace throughout the world. It is an organization that unites all our nations, is very large in number, and is very strong in solidarity." Tito then made a profound review of the successes and failures of the People's Fronts in various countries, stating: The pre-war and the great struggle for liberation proved that not every country's People's Front can be said to have faced its tasks. Because, "various agreements were only concluded by the upper-level leaders of the various parties." The People's Front included various parties, not only headed by hesitant elements, but even by reactionary and traitorous elements as leaders. These guys habitually cowardly escaped at times of crisis, and even surrendered to the fascist aggressors. This is why the Communist Parties in some countries failed to complete their organizational tasks in resisting aggression and establishing truly democratic regimes. In other words, they could not immediately mobilize the broad masses and hand over leadership to them. In some countries where resistance movements occurred later, for the above reasons, the resistance struggle was not even universal and did not produce the results that the people were enthusiastic about. Therefore, in these countries, the reactionary forces have once again seized power." Tito determined that the main error in the activities of the People's Fronts in various countries lay in: "insufficient determination and perseverance in organizing armed struggle, lack of confidence in the strength of the people, and lack of heroic leadership and a clear program. But with the exception of Greece, where the reactionary forces seized power by relying on open foreign intervention." After making the above summary, Tito warned loudly: "International reactionary forces are eager to stir up trouble, and fascism, with their assistance, is rising again; the clamor of war provocateurs is intensifying. If we do not heighten our vigilance, if we do not learn from the lessons of the recent past, if all progressive forces cannot unite not only within each country but also worldwide against war, then the danger of a new war may arise." Tito strongly stated: "The People's Front is even more important today; and it must be given new content." He pointed out: "The People's Fronts of various countries may be at different stages of development in terms of organization and politics, but only when they gradually develop into organizations that unite the people of the whole country and decide all (political, economic, social, and cultural) issues, that is to say, only when they develop into organizations that establish a single program on all issues in domestic life, can they play a major role in the internal development of various countries. Only in this way is a new type of democracy possible, and can it be obtained. Only in this way, at the current stage, can it maintain the status quo and make further progress. In this situation, the People's Front gradually develops into a single national organization, which unites the absolute majority of the people with a single purpose. Naturally, we cannot say for sure that the international reactionary forces will not oppose these, just as they oppose the one-party system and the so-called American "Four Freedoms," etc., but let them clamor as they please! They have nothing else to do. We can immediately ask them a few specific questions: "How many parties do you have?" 'Only two.' 'What kind of parties are they?' 'Essentially the same.' They exist by relying on the 'omnipotent' gold dollar dictatorship, they are the two parties of the higher financial magnates, even if there are full of good will members, they (this part of the members) can't do anything, they are willing but unable. This is the political party of Western democracy - democracy with a very bad meaning - a party through which the big capitalists realize his dictatorship, no matter how many members of these parties there are, they still only represent a handful of American big capitalists' party." Tito then gave a detailed description of the characteristics of the Yugoslav National Front's activities before the war, during the People's Liberation War, and during the post-war peaceful construction, stating: "The pre-war Yugoslav National Front included advanced elements of the working class led by the Communist Party, people's intellectuals, and peasants. The program of national unity was clearly formulated by the Communist Party, namely to resist social slavery and national oppression, to fight for the democratization and anti-fascism of the country, to defend the country from fascist aggression, to fight against the Fifth Column, and to establish and strengthen its ties with the Soviet Union. As a result, regardless of the obstruction of the leaders of all so-called bourgeois democratic parties to the National Front and its program, the broad working masses under the leadership of the Communist Party established a solid National Front before the fascist aggressors attacked Yugoslavia." Tito praised the domestic political situation during the war and exposed the treacherous actions of the leaders of the bourgeois democratic parties who abandoned the people at the moment when the fascists attacked Yugoslavia. Then he said: "Under these circumstances, the Yugoslav Communist Party won the complete trust of the broad masses and gained greater strength in the process of struggle. At this time, the Yugoslav National Front was an alliance of all progressive elements and all anti-fascist elements, struggling under the leadership of the Communist Party for national independence; preparing to fight against the aggressors and their running dogs. This is where the Yugoslav National Front differs from the People's Fronts of other countries. It became the only mainstay, because its leaders were not hesitant or reactionary." During the occupation, the activities of the National Front took on a new and broader nature, and its program also added new items: opposing the aggressors, opposing the traitors who undermined the fraternal unity of the various nationalities of Yugoslavia, organizing people's liberation committees, etc. The truly democratic nature of the National Front made it possible to establish a new people's regime. The People's Liberation Committees are representatives of this regime. Thus, they became the institutions of the National Front and performed various tasks: such as participating in the People's Liberation Army, supporting the front lines, and maintaining order in the rear of the liberated areas." "The National Front emerged in the Liberation War and became more consolidated politically. And, having gained new experience, immediately after the end of the war, it carried out a new arduous task: the establishment of the new Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia with a fair new social system." Tito emphasized the extensive and vigorous actions taken by the National Front in the demobilization, rehabilitation, and mobilization of the working masses to overcome difficulties in countries ravaged by war. Then, commenting on the future work of the National Front and the tasks of striving for the Five-Year Plan, he said: "The National Front not only represents the political unity of our people, but also represents the fraternal unity of our various nationalities. The People's Front cannot be replaced by any bourgeois political party, which is why the People's Front is developing into a permanent political organization, which is why it cannot be replaced, and which is different from all existing political parties." Tito looked back at the activities of the twenty-four political parties in pre-war Yugoslavia, stating that they all belonged to the pre-war bourgeois political parties. They have lost credibility and have no right to speak for the people. They themselves showed their inability to lead the country and proved that they have no reason to exist within the framework of the existing new social institutions; our new social system needs a new organization of political life. Our political and economic structure must exclude the possibility of the existence of many parties with old programs and old concepts. A single economic program requires political consistency. Tito continued: "The National Front includes several democratic parties, whose members and certain leaders joined the National Front earlier than its leadership organs. That is to say, they joined during the Liberation War. After the war, the leaders of these parties came to the conclusion that the National Front is the best political organization of the Yugoslav people and joined its ranks. The participation of these parties did not weaken the National Front, but rather consolidated it. The Yugoslav Communist Party is the initiator and organizer of the National Front, and now occupies a leading position, which the masses of the people have entrusted to it. Does the Yugoslav Communist Party have a different program from the National Front? No, it has no other program. So what is the difference between the Yugoslav Communist Party and other parties of the National Front? As the vanguard of the working class, the Yugoslav Communist Party has assumed a leading role in all progressive and democratic forces both in the Liberation War and now in the period of peaceful construction. The Communist Party assumed this important position under the new conditions created in the process of the People's Liberation Struggle. During the occupation, the Communist Party was the organizer and leader of the Yugoslav people's war for freedom and independence. The leadership position of the Communist Party in uniting all progressive forces within the National Front gained in social transformation is the result of the characteristics of revolutionary development, and the result of Yugoslavia's unique new road." Tito concluded: "Having eliminated the old social system in the country, implemented nationalization, and transferred the means of production to the hands of the working people, in short, after establishing a new Yugoslavia with a new political and economic structure, the interests of all workers have become common. So, what is the National Front in our country? First, the National Front is a permanent, nationwide political organization, bound by a certain program. Second, it is the political unity of our working class - workers, peasants, intellectuals, youth, women, and all citizens who work for the benefit of Yugoslavia. The National Front is the fruit of our people's great liberation war and the guarantee of fraternal unity - the guarantee of our present and future success."

　　铁托在南国民族阵线大会上号召
  　团结全世界进步力量
  　建立新的人民阵线反对战争贩子
    【新华社陕北五日电】贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫民族阵线于周前举行第二届大会，已于九月廿八日闭幕。大会选举铁托元帅为民族阵线主席，另副主席六人；又选出七人组成书记处，以尤约威克为总书记。大会通过决议，指出：“民族阵线是新型的民主主义，是真正人民的代表与仆役。”要求扩大民族阵线基层组织活动，加强民族阵线成员及一般劳动人民之政治教育。大会无条件支持爱好和平之外交政策，此一政策之目的，乃在联合国宪章基础之上，保证世界和平，并与各国发展友好关系。大会痛斥对于南、保、阿三国之诬告，并指出嫁祸上述三国之国家，应负希腊独裁内战之责。大会表示愿望世界民主分子团结一切力量，把人类从迫于眉睫的危险中拯救出来。大会对于一切民族解放运动，及为世界人民之自由独立而奋斗之战士，致亲切之慰问与同情。
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社贝尔格莱德三十日电，铁托元帅在南斯拉夫民族阵线第二届大会上发表演说称：“目前的国际形势，不但必要我们团结国内一切希望和平与进步的力量，而且必要团结并联合世界上一切进步人士为和平而奋斗，为反对那些叫嚣挑拨战争之徒而奋斗，为反对那种在制造人类历史上最大一次灾祸之徒而奋斗。我相信一切民主力量的代表很快就会团结起来，研讨各国应如何合作，如何为防止新战争灾难而奋斗。”铁托指出：“国际反动力量，以美国金融大王为首，正力谋以法西斯主义为手段，以求达到其帝国主义的目的。但是不管美国国内的法西斯主义正以空前未有的广泛程度在发展，我们仍坚决相信国际反动势力这一次仍将惨遭失败。”铁托强调：“南斯拉夫民族阵线不仅在国内生活中极端重要，而且是全世界争取和平的斗争中的一个强有力的因素，它是团结我们一切民族的组织，在数量上很庞大，在团结精神上很坚强。”铁托于是就各国人民阵线的成败经验作深刻检讨称：在战前和解放的大斗争证明，并不是每一个国家的人民阵线都能称得起面对他们的任务。因为，“各种协定只是由各党派上层领导分子缔结的。”而人民阵线包括各党派，不但以犹疑分子为首，甚且以反动的、卖国的分子作领袖。这些家伙惯常在危急的时机怯懦的逃避，甚至投降到法西斯侵略者方面去。这就是为什么某些国家的共产党在反抗侵略与成立真正的民主政权方面未能完成其组织任务。换言之，他们不能立刻使广大群众行动起来，并把领导权交给他们。在某些反抗运动发生较晚的国家，由于上述原因，反抗斗争甚至不是普遍性的、并且没有产生人民所热心的成果。因此在这些国家内，反动势力又再度握得了政权。”铁托断定各国人民阵线活动中的主要错误在于：“组织武装斗争的决心和毅力不足，对人民力量缺乏信心，没有英勇的领导和明确的纲领。但希腊除外，该国反动势力是依靠外国的公开干涉而取得政权的。”铁托在作出上项总结以后，大声警告称：“国际反动势力正蠢蠢欲动，法西斯主义赖其援助，正在重行抬头；战争挑拨者的叫嚣，愈演愈烈。假如我们不提高警惕，假如我们不吸取最近过去的经验教训，假如一切进步力不仅在各个国家之内，而且在全世界范围之内不能一致地为反对战争而团结起来，那么，新战争的危险就可能出现。”铁托力称：“人民阵线在今日已更为重要；且必须赋以新的内容。”他指出：“各国人民阵线，在组织上和政治上，可能处于不同的发展阶段，但只有它们逐渐发展成为团结全国人民，决定一切（政治的、经济的、社会的、文化的）问题的组织时，这也就是说，只有在它们发展成为在国内生活的一切问题上，都确立了单一的纲领时，它们才能在各国内部发展上起重大作用。只有这样，新型的民主才有可能，而且能够得到。只有这样，在目前的阶段上，它才可以保有现状，也可以作进一步的发展。在这种情形下，人民阵线逐渐发展成为单一的全国性的组织，它以单一的目的团结人民的绝对大多数。自然，我们不能一定说，国际反动势力就不反对这些，如同他们反对一党制度，反对所谓美国“四大自由”等一样，但是让他们肆意叫嚣去吧！他们没有别的事情可做了。我们立刻可以向他们提出几个具体的问题：“你们有几个党呢？‘只有两个。’‘他们是些什么样的党呢？’‘本质上完全相同。’它们是靠‘万能’的金元独裁支持而存在的，他们是高等金融大王的两个党，即使其中尽有满怀善意的党员，他们（这一部分党员）却什么也干不了，心有余而力不足。这就是西方民主的政党，——意义很糟糕的民主——大资本家藉以实现他独裁的政党，无论这些党的党员有多少，他们仍只代表不盈一掬的美国大资本家的党。”铁托继对南斯拉夫民族阵线在战前、在人民解放战争时期、及战后和平建设时期的活动特点作详尽的叙述称：“战前的南斯拉夫民族阵线，包括以共产党为首的工人阶级先进分子，人民知识分子和农民。民族统一的纲领，由共产党明确的制定，即反抗社会奴役及民族压迫，为国家的民主化与反法西斯而斗争，保卫国家不受法西斯侵略，向第五纵队作斗争，与苏联建立外交关系并加强其联系。结果，不管一切所谓资产阶级民主政党的领导分子对于民族阵线及其纲领的阻挠，在共产党领导下的广大劳动群众，在法西斯侵略者进攻南斯拉夫以前，便成立了巩固的民族阵线。”铁托赞扬战时国内的政治形势，并揭露资产阶级民主政党的领袖，在法西斯进攻南斯拉夫的时刻舍弃人民的叛变行动。继而说：“在这些情况下，南斯拉夫共产党赢得广大群众的完全信任，并且在斗争过程中获得更大的力量。在这个时候，南斯拉夫民族阵线是一切进步分子、一切反法西斯分子的联盟，中心在共产党的领导下为国家独立而斗争；准备为反抗侵略者及其走狗而斗争。这就是南斯拉夫民族阵线不同于其他国家人民阵线的地方。它成为唯一的中流砥柱，因为它的领袖不是犹疑或反动的。”在沦陷期间，民族阵线的活动取得了新的更广泛的性质，它的纲领也增加了新的项目：反对侵略者，反对破坏南斯拉夫各民族友爱团结的卖国贼，组织人民解放委员等等。民族阵线真正民主的本质，使建立新的人民政权成为可能。人民解放委员会就是这种政权的代表。这样它们就成为民族阵线的机构，并执行各种任务：如关于参加人民解放军，支援前线，在解放区后方维持秩序等”。“民族前线在解放战争中脱颖而出，在政治上更趋于巩固。并且由于获得新的经验，在战争结束时，立即进行新的艰巨任务：成立了具有公平的新社会制度的新南斯拉夫联帮人民共和国。”铁托强调民族阵线在受战争残害的国家的复员、善后与动员工人群众克服困难方面所作的广泛和有力的行动。继即评论民族阵线今后的工作及为五年计划奋斗的任务称：“民族阵线不仅代表了我们人民的政治团结，而且也代表着我国各民族的友爱团结。人民阵线是不能以任何资产阶级政党来代替的，这就是为什么人民阵线正发展成为永久的政治组织，这也就是为什么它是不能被代替，并且不同于一切现存政党的原因。”铁托回溯战前南斯拉夫二十四个政党的活动时称：它们都属于战前的资产阶级政党。它们已失去信用，并且没有权利代表人民说话。它们自己表现出无能领导国家，并且证实了他们在现有的新社会机构的体制内没有理由存在；我国的新社会制度需要政治生活的新组织。我国的政治结构和经济结构都要排除许多带有旧纲领、旧观念的政党之存在的可能性。单一的经济纲领，需要政治上的一致。铁托继称：“民族阵线包括几个民主的党派，这些党派的党员与某些领袖，加入民族阵线，比其领导机关为早。这就是说，在解放战争时期便加入了的。在战后，这些党派的领袖得出结论说，民族阵线是南斯拉夫人民最好的政治组织，并参加它的行列。这些党派的参加并没有削弱民族阵线，反而把它巩固起来。南斯拉夫共产党是民族阵线的发起者和组织者，现在并居于领导地位，是人民大众把这地位交托给它的。是否南斯拉夫共产党有与民族阵线不同的纲领呢？没有，它没有别的纲领。那么南斯拉夫共产党和民族阵线其他党派有什么不同呢？作为工人阶级的先锋队，南斯拉夫共产党在解放战争以及现在和平建设时期，都对一切进步民主力量，担负了领导作用。共产党是在人民解放斗争过程产生的新条件下面担负起这种重要地位的。在沦陷期间，共产党为南斯拉夫人民进行自由独立战争的组织者与领导者。共产党在社会变革中所获得的团结民族阵线内的一切进步力量的领导地位，是革命发展的特点底结果，是南斯拉夫特具的新道路底结果。”铁托结论称：“清除了国内的旧式社会制度，实行了国有化，把生产工具转到劳动人民手里，总而言之，成立了新的政治、经济结构的新南斯拉夫之后，全体工人的利益已成为共同的了。那么，民族阵线在我们国内是什么呢？第一、民族阵线是永久的、全国性的政治组织，受一个一定的纲领约束。第二、是我国劳工阶级——工人、农民、知识分子、青年、妇女、一切为南斯拉夫利益工作的公民底政治上的统一体。民族阵线就是我们人民伟大解放战争底果实，和友爱团结的保障——我们现在和未来的成功底保障。”
