　　【This newspaper, Jinnan, 16th dispatch】The Dawangzhai community in the seventh district of Yuanchao, after repeated mobilization and addressing the difficulties faced by poor peasants in planting wheat, planted an additional 4,000 mu of wheat. This community consists of nine villages, mostly sandy land, with very few livestock, making it difficult to plant more wheat. For example, some people said: "Our place has a lot of sandy land, it's no good for growing wheat, it will be blown away by the wind!" Others said: "No livestock, no wheat seeds, it's too hard to grow more wheat!" Based on the feedback and requests from the masses, repeated mobilization was carried out and various difficulties were addressed. First, arduous mobilization was conducted. For example, Dawangzhai held a branch committee meeting and a Party member mobilization meeting. The six branch committee members were to plant an additional 24 mu, and the twenty-three Party members were to plant an additional 74 mu. With the branch and Party members taking the lead, a mass mobilization was then carried out. Under the mobilization, thirty people planted an additional 91 mu, for an average of 3 mu per household and 0.7 mu per person. Through the lead of Party members and activists, a total of 250 households in the village planted an additional 750 mu of wheat. For another example, the mutual aid group of Huo Wentang in Yangzhuang, consisting of four households, planted an additional 2 mu after the first mobilization, 10 mu after the second mobilization, and 18 mu after the third mobilization, indicating that the mobilization work was multiple and could not be achieved by empty slogans. After research, the difficulties were also resolved. The general solution was: households without livestock first helped households with livestock with the autumn harvest, and households with livestock helped households without livestock plant wheat during wheat planting. After being organized, the difficulty of planting wheat in Dawangzhai was easily solved; some households without wheat seeds, and some households with poor wheat seeds, organized a wheat seed exchange movement, thus solving the difficulty of planting wheat. For example, Lü Yulan of Lü Village voluntarily donated one shi of wheat seeds. Under such repeated mobilization and specific organization, Dawangzhai community planted 4,000 mu more wheat this year than last year, an average of 0.7 mu more wheat per person than last year.

　　大王寨小区解决贫农困难
  　每人多种七分麦
    【本报冀南十六日电】元朝七区大王寨小区经过反复动员和解决贫农种麦困难，多种麦四千亩。该小区共九个村，多是沙地，牲口很少，要多种麦是很困难，如有的群众说：“咱这里沙地多，种麦子不行，见风就刮死！”还有的说：“没牲口，没有麦种，种麦多难呀！”根据群众反映和要求，便进行了反复的动员和解决各种困难，首先进行了艰苦的动员。如大王寨召开了支委会、党员动员会，六个支委要多种二十四亩，二十三个党员要多种七十四亩，在支部党员带头下，随又进行群众动员，在动员下，三十个人又多种九十一亩，共计每户平均多种三亩，每人多种七分，经过党员和积极分子的带头，全村共二百五十户，共多种麦七百五十亩。再如杨庄霍文棠互助组共四户，经第一次动员，多种二亩，进行了两次动员后，多种十亩，再经三次动员，又多种了十八亩，说明动员工作是多次的，不是空头号召所能办到的。经过研究，困难也得到了解决。其一般的解决办法：没牲口的户事先给有牲口的户帮助秋收，种麦时有牲口的给没牲口的种麦子。大王寨经过组织起来，种麦困难就迎刃而解；还有的户没有麦种，有的户麦种孬，就组织调剂麦种运动，这样种麦困难又给解决了，如吕村吕玉兰自动献出一石麦种。在这样反复的动员和具体组织下，大王寨小区今年比去年多种麦四千亩，每人平均比去年多种七分麦。
