　　Shexian Second District Accounts Break Complacency
　　Again Expanding Irrigated and Dry Wheat Fields
　　[Report from Shexian] Villages along the river in the Second District, such as Suobao, Tanyin, and Xiawen, had finished planting their irrigated land by October 15th and were about to switch to sowing dry land. However, they became complacent, thinking, "As long as the irrigated land is planted, it's okay even if the dry land isn't." Residents of Suobao reflected, "This eases the panic; the dry land still produces something, so let's take it easy!" A cadre from Xuanzhong said, "Our village planted a lot of tobacco and indigo this year, and we all made a fortune. The masses aren't very enthusiastic about planting dry land!" They also said, "Dry land is unreliable; it's no good for growing wheat!" The deputy head of Tanyin village said, "It's not too late to plant wheat here; the time around frost is just right!" (In reality, it was already the latest possible time.) Therefore, it was seen that villages along the river, which harvested a lot of grain from irrigated land, did not fear famine and were not very enthusiastic about expanding wheat fields. Thus, the leadership decided that all villages with irrigated and dry land should carry out a second expansion of wheat fields, focusing on dry land, as irrigated land has a traditional custom of planting wheat. Dry land, due to bad years, should be expanded by calculating the annual yield to compensate for deficiencies and survive disasters. Irrigated land should be used to support the great counter-offensive by expanding wheat fields. Furthermore, the movement should be launched by calculating the weather and recalling the practice of carrying water for spot sowing. Initially, when discussing with the masses, cadres and the people all resisted due to insufficient understanding of the time. The breakthrough in these villages came through great counter-offensive education. The masses changed their thinking and said, "The army is capturing Chiang Kai-shek at the front, and we must plant more wheat in the rear!" The Han Xiaosan team in Suobao proposed, "We guarantee to plant more than 80 percent." Xuanzhong's more than 400 mu of dry land was originally planned to be only half-planted, but after mobilization, more than 130 mu were added. Villages with dry land recognized the disaster by calculating the annual yield. The masses said, "Who can guarantee there won't be a drought next year? Isn't the barren land we're abandoning this year the same as planting on wheat stubble? Let's take it one season at a time; May is always closer than autumn!" In this way, villages such as Shimen, Yuli, and Liaocheng all guaranteed to plant more than 80 percent. When calculating the weather, Suobao used the fact that Baiquan water had frost, crops withered, and the shaded ditches froze an inch thick in the morning. It now takes eight days for wheat to emerge, and these concrete facts made sense to the masses. For example, the old men in West Street said, "Early spring wheat is direct sown; if you plant it late, it will come out like little garlic sprouts and won't work!" Some said, "Grain comes out ten days early, wheat comes out ten days late, now it takes eight days, so isn't it early!" After the ideas were cleared, Suobao carried out a division of labor between men and women, with women specializing in harvesting and men specializing in cultivation. Currently, the entire district is again launching a heat wave of expanding wheat fields.

　　涉县二区算帐打破麻痹
  　再次扩大水旱麦田
    【本报涉县讯】二区沿河村庄索堡、弹音、下温等村于十月十五日已将水地种完，要转向旱地收种，但思想上麻痹了，认为“水地只要种上，旱地不种也行，如索堡群众反映，“这就压住了心慌，旱地还生产哩，消停吧！”玄钟干部：“俺村今年种的菸、靛很多，都发了财。旱地种不种群众劲不大！”又说：“旱地赖，长麦子不行！”弹音村副说：“俺这里种麦可还不迟哩，到霜降正是应时麦！”（其实已是最晚的），因此看出沿河村庄有水地打粮多，不是荒年，对扩大麦田劲不大。这样领导上便确定水旱村庄一律进行再次扩大麦田，以旱地为主，因水地历年来有种麦习惯，旱地因年景不好，以计算年成，补歉渡灾，水地以支援大反攻来扩大麦田，并要以算天气和回忆担水点种来掀起运动。开始到群众中讨论，干部群众思想都是抵抗，对时间认识不足，这些村突开局面是进行了大反攻教育，群众转过思想说：“军队前方捉蒋贼，咱在后方要多种麦子”！索堡韩小三队提出：“保证要种到百分之八十以上，”玄钟四百余亩旱地原计划只种一半，动员后又增加了一百三十余亩。旱地村庄从计算年成认识了灾荒，群众说：“谁敢保明年没旱灾，今年丢的白地还不是和麦茬一样的种吗？来了一季算一季，五月总比秋天近！”这样石门、峪里、辽城等村都保证要种到百分之八十以上。在计天气时，索堡用白泉水下了霜，庄稼枯死，阴沟早晨冻一指厚，现在种麦出土就得八天，用这些具体事实一算，群众思想才通了，如西街老汉们说：“早春直麦，种的迟了，出来和小蒜苗一样就不行了！”有的说：“谷出十日早，麦出十日迟，现在就得八天，可不早了！”思想打通后，如索堡进行了男女分工，妇女专门收割，男人专耕种。目前全区再次掀起扩大麦田热潮。
