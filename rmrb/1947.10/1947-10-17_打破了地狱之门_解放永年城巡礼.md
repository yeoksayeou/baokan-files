　　Breaking Down the Gates of Hell
  　——A Tour of Liberated Yongnian City
    Huang Niu
    At dawn on October 5th, our army liberated Yongnian City. The reporter followed the army, braving the rain and wading through the water, to enter this human hell, ravaged by the Japanese invaders for eight years and then occupied by the Chiang bandits Wang Zemin, "Iron Devil" and other troops for two years. The first feeling upon entering the city was the pungent smell of corpses; the streets were full of mud and rubble. Nine out of ten houses were empty, and there wasn't a single pedestrian on the street. Only a few elderly people with swollen feet and faces would occasionally reach out to our soldiers for food at their doorsteps. Yongnian, a city of 30,000 residents, now only has 3,000 people left.
    The common people had been completely without food since the planes stopped coming on the 11th of last month. Everyone's feet and faces were swollen, and the daily death toll increased from thirty to one hundred. The people who starved to death were left unburied, and the corpses of the starved were scattered everywhere in the yards and on the streets. Not a single grain of food or any kind of edible green grass could be found in the entire city. When the people heard that the People's Liberation Army was going to transport grain into the city to provide relief, they sobbed with the little life force they had:
    "You are our saviors!"
    When the comrades from the army's cooking squad carried food into the city, they were surrounded and robbed by a group of hungry people. The soldiers couldn't eat when they saw this tragic scene, so they divided the two steamed buns they had received among the dozens of people who were reaching out to them. A child who received a bite of the bun hadn't even had time to put it in his mouth before it was snatched away by several other children who hadn't received any, demanding an equal share. The child refused, and everyone started fighting, resulting in the bite of bun being crushed into crumbs. Everyone then scrambled to eat the bun crumbs from the ground. The children who fell couldn't get up on their own, and those who were crushed underneath were too weak to shout. Anyone with a heart of iron would doubt whether they were still in the human world when they saw this tragic phenomenon...
    But now, we have broken down this solid gate of hell, and the people will crawl out of the line of starvation and death to avenge themselves and all the victims.

　　打破了地狱之门
  　——解放永年城巡礼
    黄牛
    十月五号拂晓，我军解放永年城，记者随军冒雨淌水走进这遭日寇蹂躏八年，又重遭蒋匪王泽民、铁魔头等部盘据两年的人间地狱——永年城。进城后首先给人的第一个感觉是刺鼻的尸臭；满街泥泞和瓦砾。房子已十室九空，大街上没有一个行人，有的门口上也偶有一两个肿了脚脸的老百姓向我军战士伸出手来要干粮。永年这座三万居民的城市现在只有三千人了。
    老百姓从上月十一号飞机不来即完全断粮，老百姓个个脚肿脸肿，每天的死亡数从三十增到一百，饿死的人已无人掩埋，院子里大街上到处狼籍着饿死者的尸体。全城找不着一颗粮食和任何一种能吃的青草。贴安民布告的宣传员找不到一摄白面。老百姓听说解放军要往城里运粮救济都用着仅有的一点生命力量呜咽的说：
    “你们是救命的大恩人！”
    部队上往城里送饭的炊事员同志担着饭一进城，就被一群饥饿的人民围住抢，战士目睹这种惨状不能下饭，就把领到手的两个馒头，分给向他伸着手的数十个群众，一个小孩分到一口馒头还没顾得塞到嘴里，就被另外几个没分到手的孩子把手夺住要求平分，这孩子不愿意，大家便扭打起来，结果把一口馒头夺的粉碎，大家再从地上抢馒头粉渣吃，孩子们摔倒了都不能自己起来，被压在底下的也已无力叫喊。任何铁心人看到这种悲惨现象，也会怀疑自己是否还在人间呵……。
    而现在，这牢固地狱之门，是让我们打破了，人们将从饥饿的死亡线上爬起来，为他们自己，为一切受难的死者复仇。
