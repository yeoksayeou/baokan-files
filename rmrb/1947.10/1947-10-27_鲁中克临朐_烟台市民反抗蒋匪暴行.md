    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th: The Lu Zhong Main Force Corps surrounded Linqu on the 20th, first wiping out the enemy troops guarding the west gate, and then attacking and occupying Qu Mountain east of the city in the north gate. At night, the Chiang Kai-shek Shandong Security Division's 9th Regiment and over 1,000 puppet security team members fled in panic, and Linqu city was thus recovered.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th: Yantai, under the occupation of the US-Chiang clique, has become a dark hell. The notorious traitor Ding ＠ has been appointed as the Chiang Kai-shek Yantai Mayor, and his first "benevolent rule" for the citizens is the insatiable confiscation of private property. Within three days, dozens of factories and shops, including Huafeng, Yihua, and Maosheng, were closed down, and goods and property in the warehouses were looted. Order in the city is extremely chaotic, and prices have skyrocketed, with corn rising from 1,500 to 6,000 Chiang currency per pound. More than 400 innocent people were arrested in the coastal defense camp area in one day. Anyone with a little sense of justice was labeled as a "Communist bandit" and brutally murdered. On average, ten citizens are killed every day, and the bodies of those killed are thrown into the sea. The square on the Houhai Cliff has now become a slaughterhouse for the Chiang bandits. An old woman in the Dongshan area was tied behind a motorcycle by Chiang bandits and dragged to death. Women in the Chiang army garrison area are being raped. Women in the Fushan Canal in the coastal defense camp area have been raped. Now citizens are fleeing to the liberated areas in the suburbs to take refuge. The various atrocities of the Chiang bandits have aroused resistance from the citizens. One of the twelve large cannons displayed in front of the Chiang Kai-shek court to "demonstrate" suddenly exploded on the evening of the 5th.

    【新华社华东二十五日电】鲁中基干兵团于二十日包围临朐，首将西关守敌肃清，继攻入北关占领城东之朐山，入夜蒋记山东保安师第九团及伪保安队等千余人慌忙弃城逃窜，临朐城遂告收复。
    【新华社华东二十五日电】美蒋侵据下之烟台已成黑暗地狱。臭名彰著的汉奸丁＠被委为蒋记烟台市长，他给市民的第一“德政”即无餍的没收私人财产，三天内即有华丰、义华、贸盛等数十家工厂商店被封闭，货栈财物抢劫一空，市内秩序异常混乱，物价暴涨，苞米每斤从蒋币一千五百元涨至六千元。海防营区一日之内即有四百多无辜群众被抓捕，凡稍有正义感人士，多被指为“共匪”而惨遭杀害。每日平均有市民十人被杀，被杀者尸体被抛丢入海，现后海崖之广场已成蒋匪屠场。东山区一老太婆竟被蒋匪捆在摩托车后拖死。蒋军驻地妇女横遭奸淫，海防营区福山渠妇女被奸污，现市民纷纷逃往郊外解放区避难。蒋匪各种暴行已引起市民反抗，陈列于蒋记法院门口“示威”之十二门大炮，五日晚其中一门突然爆炸。
