　　Jilu Yu Farm Experiments with Excellent Varieties
　　"Tuojie Wheat" Has a Good Harvest
　　Taihang Fifth District Agricultural and Forestry Bureau
　　Successfully Trials "811 Millet"
　　[Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 8th Dispatch] The Administrative Office, in order to improve agricultural technology and increase the material foundation of the masses, specifically established farms in Fan County and Qingyan, hired specialized technical personnel, and selected excellent seeds from various regions for detailed experimentation. The result was that "Tuojie Wheat" was a very good variety. This wheat yields more than ordinary wheat varieties by a quarter (with the same soil quality, fertilizer, and labor), matures half a month earlier than ordinary wheat, produces five more catties of flour per hundred catties, is highly resistant to disease, and does not often suffer from blight. It has many advantages. If it can be widely planted, the harvest volume will increase significantly. The Administrative Office specifically calls on the masses to seize the opportunity, bring village certification procedures to the farm, and exchange ordinary wheat at a catty-for-catty rate.
　　[Our Newspaper] The Taihang Fifth District Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, in Shicaiying and Mengjiazhuang villages in the Third District of Cixian County, promoted the "811 Millet." Two seasons of experiments and yield comparisons were conducted. At the time, the masses did not understand the quality of "811 Millet" and were afraid of delaying the planting of wheat, so they were hesitant to plant it. After the comrades of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau explained and offered guarantees, the masses planted it. Thirty-nine households in the two villages planted a total of sixty-eight mu. It was sown between June 8th and 13th after the wheat was harvested this year, and it had fully matured and been harvested by September 12th to 15th. The growing period was ninety to ninety-five days. The masses said: "811 Millet is very good. It can be planted twice a year (sown after harvesting wheat). In terms of yield, it generally yields two to five dou (22-catty dou) more per mu than local millet. Local millet yields eight dou to one shi per mu, while 811 Millet yields one shi and three dou to one shi and five dou per mu. For example, public security officer Feng Qi planted two types of millet on one plot of land. With the same cultivation and fertilization, the local millet yielded only one shi and three dou per mu and five fen, while 811 Millet yielded one shi and three dou per mu, yielding seven dou and five sheng more per mu. Zhao Jingui harvested three shi from two mu of 811 Millet. After the harvest, the masses reflected that: "811 Millet just yields more grain, we will plant more next year." They are all exchanging for 811 Millet seeds. Yang Ruifang said: "I received 811 Millet seeds, but I was afraid of delaying the planting of wheat, so I didn't dare to plant them. Now that I see that the 811 Millet planted by others doesn't delay the planting of wheat and yields more grain, I regret it. I will definitely plant 811 Millet next year." (Chongwen, Guifang)

　　冀鲁豫农场试验优良品种
  　“蝤孑麦”收成好
  　太行五专农林局
  　八一一谷试种成功
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】行署为了提高农业技术，增加群众物质基础，特在范县、清盐设置农场，聘请专门技术人员，选择各地优良种子，详尽试验。结果“蝤孑麦”种很好，该麦较一般麦种产量多四分之一强（同样的土质、肥料、劳力），成熟较一般麦早半月，每百斤可多出五斤面，抗毒性强，不常生疸，优点很多，若能普遍种植，收获量当增加很多。行署特号召群众抓紧时机，携带村证明手续到农场，用普通麦种斤与斤的兑换。
    【本报讯】太行五专农林局，在磁县三区时材营、孟家庄两村，推广的八一一谷子，系作两季试验和产量比较，当时群众不了解八一一谷好坏，怕耽误种麦子，不敢种。经农林局同志解释并提出保证，群众才种上。两村有三十九户共种六十八亩，是今年割了麦子六月八日至十三日下种的，到九月十二日至十五日已全部成熟收割了。生长期是九十天至九十五天。群众说：八一一谷很不错一年能种两季，（割麦后下种）在产量上一般每亩比本地谷多打三斗至五斗，（二十二斤斗）本地谷每亩收八斗至一石，八一一谷每亩收成一石三斗至一石五斗。例如公安员冯祺在一块地种两样谷，同样耕种上肥，种本地谷一亩五分才打了一石三斗，种八一一谷一亩就打了一石三斗，每亩多打七斗五升。赵金贵种八一一谷二亩打了三石。收割后群众反映说：八一一谷就是好多打粮食，明年咱可要多种。都纷纷换八一一谷种子。杨瑞方说：“我领上八一一谷种子，怕耽误种麦，就没敢种上，现在看见人家种的八一一谷又不误种麦，又多打粮食，我可后悔啦，明年我一定要种八一一谷”。（崇文、贵芳）
