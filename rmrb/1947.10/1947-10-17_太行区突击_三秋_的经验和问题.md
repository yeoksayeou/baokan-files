　　With the arrival of the Cold Dew solar term, the Taihang District's "Three Autumns" (autumn harvest, autumn planting (wheat), and autumn plowing) movement is in its most intense period. Under the rallying cries of "Seize the Autumn to Secure the Summer" and "Hurry Ahead and Don't Fall Behind, Support the Great Counter-Offensive," and with the organizational guarantee of "Organize All Full, Half, and Auxiliary Labor to Blitz the Three Autumns," many villages along the Pinghan Railway, in the Xingtai-Shahe area, have completed harvesting and planting, and are now rushing to plow the autumn stubble. For example, in Shahe's Sixth District, the autumn grain was harvested before the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, and wheat fields, accounting for 70 percent of the total land area, or approximately 50,000 mu, have also been planted recently. In the mountainous areas of Taihang, due to the uneven ripening of autumn grain, Cao Linshui, a labor hero from Changzhi, and his mutual aid team, after harvesting and transporting millet, have not finished harvesting miscellaneous autumn crops, and have only planted one-third of the planned wheat acreage. In Licheng's First District, over 7,600 mu of wheat have been planted (totaling over 27,000 mu including regular crop wheat), and generally speaking, it is expected that the area along the Pinghan Railway will be cleared and harvested by the beginning of the ninth lunar month, and mountainous areas such as Li and Ping will be cleared and plowed by the middle and late ninth lunar month.

    The characteristics of this year's harvest and plowing are: Firstly, the emancipated peasants are harvesting crops they planted themselves for the first time, and are highly motivated due to the national counter-offensive situation. However, at the same time, they lack farm tools, livestock, and seeds due to just having been emancipated, and some even lack land. Secondly, there was summer drought and autumn floods (heavy autumn rains), resulting in uneven ripening of autumn grain and the possibility of early frost in some areas. Thirdly, most sub-districts are conducting harvest and plowing simultaneously with conscription, further straining the labor force. Therefore, the key to solving this year's "Three Autumns" problems is: (1) organizing all male, female, and auxiliary labor to blitz the "Three Autumns"; (2) adjusting land, farm tools, livestock, and seeds to meet the wheat planting needs of poor and hired peasants, in order to expand wheat acreage.

    I. Organize Male, Female, and Auxiliary Labor to Blitz Autumn Harvesting, Planting, and Plowing.

    Organizing all full and half-labor force, engaging in mutual aid and labor exchange, and achieving "three mores" (more grain than in previous years, more wheat planted, and more fertilizer applied to wheat fields) and "three clears" (harvest ripe crops cleanly, transport them to the threshing ground cleanly, and plow the stubble land cleanly) are the common thoughts and demands of the emancipated masses. Therefore, according to reports from various regions, auxiliary laborers participating in mutual aid for harvesting and plowing account for at least 70 percent of all auxiliary labor, and in some cases over 90 percent. In Putongdian, Shahe County, 260 out of 380 women were organized to work in the fields for harvesting and plowing, not counting children, accounting for at least 70 percent of the total auxiliary labor force. In Xicui Village, the county organized 80 percent; In Bizhao mutual aid team, Sudian, Changzhi, with the exception of two old ladies watching the door, all 22 households went to the fields, and the number of women and children going to the fields in the whole village reached 501, accounting for more than 90 percent of the total auxiliary labor force. Elementary schools in various places suspended classes to participate in harvesting and plowing, and men and women over 60 years old and children of 12 and 13 years old all undertook certain harvesting and plowing tasks. Therefore, the entire district can strive for early harvesting, early planting, and early plowing according to local conditions (such as climate). And pay attention to deep plowing and careful cultivation to avoid roughness. Nantianhe, Xiazhuang, Beiliu and other villages have special production visiting groups, inspecting and observing at any time, exchanging experiences, and ensuring deep plowing and careful cultivation.

    The experience of organizing all labor to participate in autumn harvesting and planting and autumn plowing can be divided into:

    First, heroes, branches, party members, and activists take the lead in opening up the situation and implementing the leadership line of the poor and hired peasants in production. For example, the party branch secretary (who is also a hero) and activists of Nantianhe, Changzhi, started 14 people, including mothers and children, Jize, and Liuzhi, to harvest grain on cloudy days, and put forward the slogan of preventing continuous rain, rushing to harvest and transport, and harvesting all the grain. This dispelled the masses' ideas of waiting for sunny and dry weather, valuing gardens (planting winter vegetables) over fields (harvesting autumn), and everyone acted together. On the 24th, before dawn, all the people and cattle in the village went to the fields and harvested 373 mu of grain and converted 63 mu of wheat in one day. Zhang Jinlong, a bankrupt landlord in Shangyu Village, Xiangyuan, failed to lead the cultivation of the land properly as the production team leader, resulting in one-third of the spring seedlings not being managed well this year. Shen Sanyuan, the mutual aid team leader, said: People don't plan for us, how can they lead production well? After a resolution was passed at a meeting on the 27th of last month to remove him from his post, a production committee was established with branch secretary Wang Tiancai, agricultural manager Zhao Cunfa, and nine others. After adjusting labor, livestock, tools, and seeds, they began to blitz the harvest and plowing from the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, harvesting 382 mu and plowing 27 mu in two days, and threshing three fields, creating a harvest and plowing competition movement. The experience of Huguan and other counties also believes that unified leadership of autumn harvesting and plowing by branch secretaries, agricultural managers, village chiefs, heroes, etc. is very necessary.

    Second, arrange life and scientific division of labor. Accurately calculate the number of various crops, labor, and livestock in the entire village or mutual aid team, and uniformly adjust and use labor, livestock, and farm tools (also converted into shares) based on the principle of taking care of newly emancipated households, and formulate work steps for unified deployment. The division of labor makes the best use of each person's strengths. For example, women and children are in charge of autumn harvesting, and male full labor and livestock are in charge of plowing, planting converted wheat, and transporting crops back. Other arrangements, such as collective cooking and eating in the morning, saving time to rush to work, are organized according to specific circumstances.

    Third, fair and reasonable work point evaluation according to the amount of work. This is an important factor in consolidating auxiliary labor's participation in harvesting and plowing mutual aid to the end. Most places adopt three forms under the general principle of evaluating work according to the amount of work: (1) Large contract work, used in plowing autumn stubble in Pingshun. The method is to calculate and evaluate all the land, livestock, plows, rakes, etc. in the village into fixed points. According to the amount of land in the entire village, the labor and livestock are divided into teams. Each plot is assigned fixed points, and then plowed one after another; (2) Small contract work, in Pingshun and Changzhi. The method is to contract work by plot in the field, and assign fixed points to that plot; (3) Large labor exchange, the most widely used in various places. Generally, it is a team-to-team exchange, with the entire village using a unified work ticket. The first two forms are convenient for accounting, but the land, livestock, etc. must be precisely assigned points to be fair; the latter assigns points and work tickets according to the amount of work done, but accounting is troublesome. Regardless of the form, the entire village must have unified leadership and a unified standard for scoring and recording work.

    Fourth, challenges and competitions to improve labor efficiency. Nantianhe prepared two red flags to reward model autumn harvesters and wheat planters, which caused the entire village to go to the fields before dawn to harvest and plow. Everyone wanted to win the award, which led to the early completion of the grain harvesting plan. In Guxian Village, Changzhi, more than 90 men, women, young adults, and a few children rushed to harvest 484 mu of corn and 30 mu of grain in two nights, which was equivalent to the harvesting achievements of three days during the day, and challenged Yangtou Village with this, gambling for a red flag. This is very common in various places.

    II. Adjust Land, Livestock, and Farm Tools to Meet the Wheat Planting Needs of Poor and Hired Peasants.

    Xiangyuan and Xiyang have universally found that newly emancipated peasants lack farm tools, livestock, fertilizer, and seeds. Shahe, Lincheng, Zanhuang, Gaoyi, and Neiqiu along the Pinghan Railway have recently found that poor and hired peasants lack land for planting wheat. For example, a check during wheat planting in Nanwang Village, Sixth District of Shahe, found that Cui Shuanzhu's family of three had only three mu of land, and only two mu could be planted with wheat. The average wheat area per capita for 22 households of widows and soldiers was only slightly more than 0.8 mu, while 17 households of activists had an average of 8.4 mu of land per person, with an average of 4 mu of wheat per person. Zheng Laosha (a hired peasant) in Chengguan, Lincheng, with a family of four, had only three mu of land that could be planted with wheat. He said, "I could plant another four mu if I had it!" The above examples show that the land reform was not thorough, the hired and poor peasants were not completely emancipated, and the activists occupied the fruits of the masses. The thorough solution to the problem still lies in the future. At present, various places have only put forward preliminary measures to meet the wheat planting needs of poor and hired peasants. Lincheng uses village-owned school fields and public fields to temporarily adjust to poor and hired peasants; or adjusts through private channels; seeds are solved by the cooperative. Under these circumstances, 90 poor and hired households in the Third District have been helped and planted an additional 5,050 mu of wheat. Zanhuang lets households that have been struggled against perform obligatory plowing for poor and hired households to solve part of the labor force (mainly solved through labor exchange). Nanwang Village in Shahe also adjusted 73 mu of wheat to poor and hired households. Pingshun provided 8 million loans with 0.5% interest to poor and hired peasants to buy farm tools, livestock, etc.

　　太行区突击“三秋”的经验和问题
    本报资料室整理
    寒露已到。太行区秋收、秋种（麦）、秋耕“一锅煮”运动正处在最紧张时期。各县翻身农民，在“抢秋夺夏”、“赶前不赶后、支援大反攻”等鼓动口号及“全半辅劳组织起来，突击三秋”的组织保证下，平汉线邢（台）沙（河）一带不少村庄收种已完，正赶垡秋茬中。如沙河六区秋禾在阴历八月十八前割完，全区麦田占总土地百分之七十，计五万亩左右，最近亦已种完；太行山区则因秋禾成熟期不一，长治劳英曹林水互助大队收、运完谷子，杂秋没收完，改麦才种计划中的三分之一；黎城一区改麦七千六百余亩（连正茬麦共二万七千余亩）亦已种完，总的说来，平汉沿线在阴历九月初、上旬可望地净场光，山区如黎、平一带九月中、下旬定可场光地犁完。
    今年收耕特点是：翻身农民首次收获自己种出的庄稼，加上全国大反攻形势，情绪很高；但同时因为刚翻身，缺乏农具牲畜、籽种，有的甚至缺乏土地。其次夏旱秋涝（秋雨多），秋禾生熟不一，地有早冻可能。再次大部分分区收耕、参军同时进行，劳力更不充裕。因此，解决今年“三秋”问题的关键是：（一）组织全部男女半辅劳力突击“三秋”；（二）调剂土地、农具、牲畜、种子，满足贫雇种麦要求，达到扩大麦田目的。
    一、组织男女半辅力，突击秋收、秋种、秋耕。
    全半劳力组织起来，互助变工，及早达到三多（粮食比往年多，种麦子多，麦地上肥多），三光（庄稼黄了收光，运到了场里打光，茬子地垡光），是翻身群众的普遍心思和要求。故根据各地反映，今年辅劳组织起来互助收耕者，占全部辅劳至少百分之七十，最高百分之九十以上。沙河普通店妇女三百八十个，组织上地收耕的二百六十个，儿童未计，至少占辅劳总数百分之七十，该县西崔村则组织起来百分之八十；长治苏店毕二招互助组廿二户，除留下两个老太太看门，全部都上了地，全村上地妇女儿童达五百零一人，占全部辅劳百分之九十以上。各地小学停课参加收耕，六十以上男女，十二、三岁的儿童都担任一定收耕任务。因此，全区都能按当地环境（如气候冷热之类）争取早收、早种和早耕。并注意深耕细作，避免粗糙。南天河、霞庄、北流等村专门有生产参观团，随时检查观摩，交流经验，保证深耕细作。
    一切劳力组织起来参加秋收秋种与秋耕的经验可分：
    第一、英雄、支部、党员、积极分子带头打开局面并贯澈生产中贫雇领导路线。如长治南天河支书（又是英雄）和积极分子起好母子、记则、六只等十四人一面抢阴天割谷，提出防止连阴雨，抢收抢运，十分庄稼十分收等口号，打消了群众中等天晴地干，重园（种冬菜）轻田（收秋）等思想，一齐行动起来，二十四号天不明，全村人、牛上地，一天就割谷三百七十三亩，改麦六十三亩。襄垣上峪村破产地主张金隆当生产组长，没好好领导耕地，使今年三分之一春苗没捉好，互助组长申三元说：人家就不为咱打算，还能领导好生产？经上月二十七号大会决议撤换，另选出支书王天才、农主赵存法等九人成立生产委员会，经调剂劳畜、工具、种子后，阴历八月十八日起开始突击收耕，两天收割三百八十二亩，耕地二十七亩，打谷三场，造成秋收耕地竞赛运动。壶关等县经验也认为由支书、农主、村长、英雄等统一领导秋收秋耕是十分必要的。
    第二、安排生活与科学分工。精确计算全村或互助组内各种农作物、劳畜力数量，在照顾新翻身户原则下统一调剂、使用劳畜、农具（也折犋顶分），拟出工作步骤统一布置。劳力分工是各施所长，如妇女儿童管收秋，男全劳力及牲口管垡地、种改麦、往回运庄稼等。其他如上午集体作饭、吃饭，省晌赶活等均按具体情况组织安排。
    第三、公道合理、按活计工评分。这是巩固辅劳参加收耕互助到底的重要的因素。各地多半在按活评工总原则下采用三种形式：（一）大包工，运用于平顺垡秋茬中。办法是把全村土地、畜力、犁耢等均经详细计算评成死分，按全村土地多少，把劳畜力按组队划分，每块订成死分，然后挨着垡，垡了上块垡下块；（二）小包工，平顺、长治均有。办法是到地里按块包工，就这一块地作成死分；（三）大变工，各地采用最多。一般是组与组队与队变，全村统一使用一种工票。前两种形式算帐方便，土地、牲口等订分要精细才能公道；后一种是作多少给多少分和工票，但算帐麻烦。无论那种形式，均必须全村统一领导与一种评分记工标准。
    第四、挑战竞赛，提高劳动效率。南天河做了两杆红旗准备奖励秋收种麦模范，引起全村人天不明上地收耕，谁也想得奖，使割谷计划提前完成。长治故县村男女青壮及少数儿童九十余人，两夜抢玉茭四百八十四亩，谷三十亩，等于白天三天收割成绩，以此向洋头村挑战，赌一杆红旗。各地都很普遍。
    二、调剂土地、牲畜、农具，满足贫雇种麦要求。
    襄垣、昔阳各地普遍发现新翻身农民缺乏农具、牲畜、肥料、种子，平汉沿线沙河、临城、赞皇、高邑、内邱最近更发现贫雇农缺少种麦土地。例如沙河六区南旺村种麦中检查发现：崔拴柱三口人只有三亩地，能种麦者又只有二亩，二十二户孤寡抗属平均每人只能种麦八分多；而十七户斗争积极分子每人平均地八亩四，每人能种麦四亩。临城城关郑老傻（雇农）四口人只有三亩地能种麦，他说：“再有四亩也能种上”！上列例证看出：土地改革不彻底，雇贫没翻透身，斗争积极分子侵占了群众果实。问题的彻底解决还在于以后，目前各地只提出初步满足贫雇种麦要求办法。临城是：村有校田、公田暂调剂给贫雇；或者由民间调剂；种子由合作社解决，在此情形下，三区有九十户贫雇得到帮助，多种了五千零五十亩麦子。赞皇让被斗争户替贫雇户义务耕种以解决部分劳力（主要还须变工解决）。沙河南旺村也调剂出七十三亩麦给贫雇户。平顺五厘息贷款八百万给贫雇农买农具、畜力等。
