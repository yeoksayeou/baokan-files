　　【Report from Taiyue, October 15th】Yang Jianwen was dismissed from his post and expelled from the Party for opposing the masses' struggle against his feudal family. Yang Jianwen is from the Third District of Wenxi County. His family was a feudal rich peasant family that engaged in usury and exploitation. Yang Jianwen joined our Fourth District Office in 1945 and served as the district head from 1946 until now. However, his participation in revolutionary work was not for the purpose of serving the people, but to preserve his feudal property. From 1945 to the present, in his actions, words, and handling of issues, he consistently opposed the poor and protected the rich. After the masses in his village struggled against his family, he attacked the village cadres, saying, "My family is a middle peasant family and should not be struggled against. You are wrong to struggle against us." Later, he went to the district to question the chairman of the peasant association, saying, "My family is a middle peasant family, why should we be struggled against?" When district cadres pointed out that his family was clearly a feudal rich peasant family and should be liquidated, he not only refused to accept it but also argued with everyone and attempted to replace the peasant association in his village, and filed a lawsuit against the village cadres. Furthermore, at the county and district cadre meetings, he openly opposed mobilizing poor and hired peasants. All of these actions prove that Yang ultimately did not abandon his feudal standpoint and opposed the masses' struggle for liberation, which aroused the unanimous indignation of the masses and county and district cadres. In order to respond to the demands of the masses, the county leadership issued an order to remove him from his position as district head and suspend his Party membership.

　　杨建文反对土改被革职停止党籍
    【本报太岳十五日电】杨建文反对群众斗争其封建家庭，被撤职，停止党籍。杨建文是闻喜三区人，其家庭系封建富农，放高利贷剥削。杨建文于三十四年参加我四区公所工作，三十五年任区长，直至现在。但其参加革命工作，不是为人民服务，而是为了保存其封建财产，从三十四年至现在，其行动上、言语上、处理问题上，一贯反对穷人，维护富人。当该村群众斗争他家之后，便打击村干部说：“我家是中农，不应斗，你们斗错了。”后又到区上质问农会主席说：“我家是中农，为什么要斗争？”区干部提出，他家明明是封建富农，被清算是应该的，他不但不接受，反而与大家斗意见，并活动企图改换他村的农会，与村干部打官司；又在县区干部会议上，公开反对发动贫雇农。如此种种行为证明，杨终未放弃其封建立场，反对群众翻身斗争，引起群众及县区干部的一致愤恨。该县领导上为答复群众要求，明令取消其区长职务，并停止其党籍。
