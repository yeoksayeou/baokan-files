Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 23rd, the Nanjing Chiang Kai-shek authorities are panicking due to the major victories won by the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensives on all fronts. The message stated, "The main barometer of this unease is Chiang Kai-shek himself. In times of crisis (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis), he even left the capital -- this fact admits that everything is not going smoothly." The message pointed out: Following his trips to Beiping and Shenyang, Chiang flew to Qingdao, "indicating the seriousness of the Shandong situation," and said, "Everyone has recently reported that this battlefield is 'stable,' but now it seems that the Communists are still as strong as before, constantly engaging in combat, tying down the troops that Chiang Kai-shek hopes to transport to the Northeast." A message from the 20th of the same agency also stated that the power of the Jiaodong People's Liberation Army's offensive has caused "serious concern" among the Chiang Kai-shek authorities, and the people of Yantai believe that the People's Liberation Army will recapture "this seaport that they have controlled since the collapse of Japan." The telegram also stated: "Due to the activity of the guerrillas, the Kuomintang army in Yantai cannot go beyond a few miles outside the city." A United Press dispatch on the 23rd also said: "Chiang Kai-shek is extremely secretive about his movements. When he was in Qingdao, the Qingdao authorities suppressed anything written by reporters, even trivial news such as his meeting with the former Australian liaison officer, Gesewo. After he arrived in Shanghai, the Shanghai newspapers again obeyed the News Bureau's order not to publish news about him," and said, "This caution is a safety measure taken because Chiang Kai-shek remembers the rumors circulating outside that his subordinates are unstable." According to a Reuters report, Chiang Kai-shek is escorted by P-51 Mustang aircraft in the air, also for "safety reasons."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: According to a Central News Agency report on the 20th, Song Ziwen recently specially invited Ke Wen. Dong, the military attache of the US Embassy in Nanjing, to Guangzhou to "assist in planning" Guangdong military affairs in order to deal with the powerful people's armed forces active in Guangdong. It is said that Mr. Ke will leave for the place soon. This incident shows that the American imperialist running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek government, is actively expanding Chiang-American military cooperation in an attempt to protect its American master's economic plunder and the security of military bases in South China.

    山东蒋匪战局严重
    蒋贼疑神疑鬼坐卧不安
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据美联社上海二十三日电报导：南京蒋匪当局正因各线解放军反攻，均获重大胜利而惊惶不安。该消息称：“这种不安的主要晴雨计，便是蒋介石自己。在危急的时期（指蒋匪军事危急），他竟离开首都，——这个事实便是承认一切进行得不顺利。”该消息指出：紧接北平沈阳之行，蒋又飞往青岛，“指明了山东战局的严重性，”并说：“这个战场最近任何人都报导说已经‘安定’了，但是现在看来，共产党仍然和以前一样强大，不断进行战斗，牵制了蒋介石所希望运往东北去的军队。”二十日该社消息也说胶东人民解放军攻势的威力，已引起蒋匪当局“严重忧虑”，烟台人民皆相信人民解放军会克复“这个他们自日本崩溃后即加控制的海港。”该电并谓：“由于游击队的活跃，烟台国民党军已不能越出该市数里。”二十三日美联社电讯又说：“蒋介石对其行踪保守极端秘密，当他在青岛时，青岛当局扣压记者所写的任何东西，甚至象他会见澳洲的前联络官格塞渥一类的无所谓消息也不放过。他到上海后，上海各报又遵守新闻局命令不登关于他的新闻”，并说：“这种谨慎，是因为蒋介石记住了外间所传他的部下将领不稳的消息而采取的安全措施”。另据路透社消息，蒋介石在空中均用ＰＳ野马式飞机护送，也是为了“安全关系”。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据中央社二十日消息透露：宋子文曾于最近特别邀请南京美大使馆军事参赞柯文·董到广州“协助计划”广东军事事务，以对付活跃于广东之强大人民武装。据称，柯氏不久即启程前往。此事显示美帝国主义走狗蒋匪政府正积极扩大蒋美军事合作，以此企图保障其美国主子在华南之经济掠夺及军事基地之安全。
