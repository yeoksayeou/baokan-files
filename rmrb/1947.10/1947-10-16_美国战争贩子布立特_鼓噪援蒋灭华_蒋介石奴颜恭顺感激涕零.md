Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th—One of the warmongers named by Vyshinsky, former US ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, Bullitt, published a wildly arrogant report on China in the Life and Time magazines published by Time Inc. on the 9th, frantically advocating that the US government should employ 400 million Chinese people to fight for the American invaders at the "low price" of $1.35 billion. The man-eating animal Bullitt dreams that as long as Chiang Kai-shek is given a $600 million loan, a $150 million monetary fund, and $600 million in military aid, then "China can mobilize 400 million Chinese people to fight against the Soviet Union, which is a great benefit to the United States." This human flesh market boss, who buys a Chinese life for an average of three dollars, is recommended by Bullitt to be "most suitable for Marshal MacArthur." This arrogant document was, as usual, loudly applauded by other American warmongers, including the notorious US House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton. The traitorous Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, even "cheaper" than the American warmongers had imagined, was overjoyed at the price tag of $1.35 billion, drooling and gratefully moved to tears. Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman Dong Xian Guang said on the 10th: "Mr. Bullitt's article is most timely and thought-provoking, and will help to clarify the current popular misunderstanding of China."

It is reported that Bullitt came to China in July this year as a special correspondent for "Life" and "Time" magazines. The publishers of these two magazines, Henry Luce and his wife, are known for their pro-fascist and hostile attitude towards democratic movements in various countries. Their publishing company is on Wall Street. In particular, the Time Publishing Company, controlled by Morgan, is one of the main propaganda organs of the American reactionaries. Luce and Bullitt have both come to China more than once, and each time they have been served by Chiang Kai-shek as if they were imperial envoys. According to reliable sources, Bullitt was received in the mansion of Song Ziwen, the corrupt king of China, and his task was to make a so-called plan for Chiang Kai-shek to defeat the Chinese Communist Party in three years. The main part of this plan is to pour a large amount of American gold and American advisors into the cesspool of Nanjing. Under the name of "saving the collapse," it tries to prolong the civil war in China and control all aspects of China. It is reported that all kinds of American advisors are now entering various departments of the Nanjing government. American military advisors have recently started working officially in the Ministry of National Defense in Nanjing. However, large-scale American financial assistance is still waiting for Bullitt and his accomplices to advocate in the United States, because even on Wall Street, some people believe that it is not very promising to extract profits from the dried-up Chiang Kai-shek cesspool like flies. Bullitt told Chiang Kai-shek that he should take the initiative to seek American assistance. It is said that the inspiration for the Chiang Kai-shek government's bold "criticism" of Wedemeyer's statement came from Bullitt's plan, because although Wedemeyer's purpose was also to control China, some of the wording of his statement had caused a side effect of discouraging American investors. Observers believe that Bullitt immediately published this article after returning to China, demanding that the United States give Chiang Kai-shek $1.35 billion and put China under the unified jurisdiction of MacArthur, who helped Japan revive, which is part of the agreement negotiated by Bullitt and Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing. Bullitt stayed in China for more than two months, went to Northeast China in mid-August, and left China in mid-September to return to the United States. On the way, he arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam on September 27, where he was also treated as a distinguished guest by the French military authorities. The latter fact shows that American imperialism is actively organizing the unprecedented oppression of the liberation movements of the Eastern nations through a series of conspiracies.

　　美国战争贩子布立特
  　鼓噪援蒋灭华
  　蒋介石奴颜恭顺感激涕零
    【新华社陕北十四日电】维新斯基所指名的战争贩子之一，美国前驻苏、驻法大使布立特，在九日美国时代出版公司所出生活、时代两杂志上发表关于中国的狂妄报告，疯狂鼓吹美国政府应以十三亿五千万美元的“低廉代价”，雇佣四万万中国人为美国侵略者作战。食人动物布立特梦想只要给蒋介石六亿美元贷款，一亿五千万美元货币基金，和六亿美元的军事援助，则“中国即可动员四万万中国人民对苏作战，对美国是一个极大的利益。”这个平均以三块美元买进一条中国人命的人肉市场老板，据布立特推荐“以麦克阿瑟元帅最为适当”。这个狂妄的文件，照例为美国其他战争贩子们所高声喝采，其中包括臭名昭著的美国众议院外委会主席伊登。比美国战争贩子们所意想的还要“低廉”的卖国贼蒋介石匪帮，则对着十三亿五千万美元的标价大喜过望，馋涎欲滴，感激涕零。蒋介石发言人董显光十日谈话称：“布氏此文最合时宜与发人深省，并有助于廓清现下流行的对于中国的错误认识。”
    按布立特系于本年七月以“生活”、“时代”两杂志特派记者名义来华，该两杂志的发行人亨利·鲁斯及其妻，素以亲法西斯而仇视各国民主运动著名，其出版公司在华尔街。特别是摩根支配之下的时代出版公司，乃是美国反动派的主要宣传机关之一。鲁斯和布立特，都曾不止一次地来到中国，每一次都被蒋介石当作钦差大臣一样的侍奉。据可靠方面透露，布氏此次来华，被接待于中国贪污大王宋子文的公馆中，其任务是为蒋介石作出所谓三年击败中共的计划。这一计划的主要部分，即为以大量美国金元和美国顾问倾入南京的粪坑中。在“挽救崩溃”的名义下，力图延长中国的内战并控制中国的各方面。据悉：各式各样的美国顾问现正纷纷进入南京政府各部门。美国的军事顾问，最近已开始在南京国防部正式办公。但美国大量财政援助，尚待布立特及其同谋者在美国多方鼓吹，因为甚至在华尔街中，也有若干人认为象苍蝇似的从干枯的蒋介石粪坑里吸取利润，是没有多大希望的事。布立特告诉蒋介石，应当主动争取美国援助。据称：蒋介石政府对魏德迈声明的大胆“批评”，其灵感的泉源即出于布立特的锦囊，因为魏德迈的目的，虽然同样在于控制中国，但其声明的某些词句，曾引起一种沮丧美国投资者的副作用。观察家相信：布氏回国后，立即发表此文，要求美国给予蒋介石十三亿五千万美元，并要求把中国置于一手扶助日寇复兴的麦克阿瑟的统一管辖下，乃布立特在南京与蒋介石谈判协议的一部分。布立特留华两个多月，八月中曾去东北，九月中离华返美，途中于九月廿七日到达越南河内，在该处亦被法国军事当局奉为上宾。后一事实表明美帝国主义正在以一系列的阴谋，积极组织对于东方各民族解放运动之无例外的压迫。
