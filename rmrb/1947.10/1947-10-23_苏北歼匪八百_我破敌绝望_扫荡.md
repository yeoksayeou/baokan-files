　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st: Local armed forces in the Huaihai region, in coordination with a unit of the People's Liberation Army, crushed a desperate "mopping-up" operation by six regiments of Chiang's troops against the Huaiyin-Muyang-Lianshui area within seven days in early October, killing or wounding 800 enemy soldiers below the rank of regimental and battalion commander. Since the People's Liberation Army shattered Chiang's army's "mopping-up" operation against the Huai'an-Lianshui-Funing triangle area last month, six regiments of Chiang's army, including the 51st Division, the Temporary 25th Division (reorganized from the puppet Sun Liangcheng's unit in late August), and parts of the 75th Division, launched an offensive from Huaiyin and Lianshui towards the Huaiyin-Lianshui-Muyang area on October 6. The People's Liberation Army and local militia fought a series of rearguard actions, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. By the 12th, the counter-"mopping-up" operation had concluded victoriously. On the northern front, our troops fought bravely at the Liutang River and the Erwei River mouth on the 7th, killing or wounding more than 20 enemy soldiers, including Mu Mingyuan, the battalion commander of the 121st Regiment of the 51st Division. On the 8th, a unit of local armed forces repelled three enemy assaults on the river defense between Yangkou and Shenji, killing or wounding more than 30 more. On the 10th, the enemy concentrated two regiments, crossed the Liutang River, and advanced in several directions. Our troops completely defeated them at the Chaimi River, killing or wounding more than 500 enemy soldiers. During this period, a certain company of local armed forces repelled six assaults by two enemy battalions, killing or wounding more than 200 enemy soldiers, including Liu Wei, the regimental commander of the 121st Regiment, setting an example of local armed forces winning battles with fewer troops. After suffering such heavy blows, the enemy fled west across the Muhuai Road towards the Muyang south direction on the Grand Canal line on the 12th. On the southern front, the Chiang's troops from Huaiyin and Lianshui were constantly attacked by the local armed forces and militia, and were terrified, firing guns and setting fires all night to embolden themselves. By this point, they were all trapped in Huaiyin, and the enemy's desperate "mopping-up" operation had completely failed. The 80-mile Muhuai Highway remains under the control of the People's Liberation Army.
