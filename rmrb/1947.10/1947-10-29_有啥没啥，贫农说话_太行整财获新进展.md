　　“Whether There Is Anything or Not, Let the Poor Peasants Speak”
  　New Progress in Financial Rectification in Taihang
    [Our Newspaper Comprehensive Dispatch] Recently, the Taihang District has made new progress in rectifying village finances. Its characteristic is that it is mainly based on poor and hired peasants, combined with squeezing out feudal elements, to conduct a large-scale clean-up and rectification of village finances, achieving many unprecedented results. In the past, many landlords and rich peasants infiltrated village financial institutions, engaging in corruption and sabotage. Among the 48 warehouse directors and committee members in Anyang First District, there were eight landlords and three rich peasants. Guo Wenshu, the warehouse director of Xiaozhai Village in the county, was a bankrupt landlord. Taking advantage of his position as warehouse director, he used a large scale for intake and a small scale for output, adding iron rings to the scale weight, collecting 300 catties more for every 10,000 catties of grain. The year before last, when KMT secret agents conspired to riot, he secretly supplied 3,000 catties of public grain to the rioters. Last year, when the KMT army invaded Shuiye, he deliberately withheld grain distribution, resulting in the loss of 3,700 catties of public grain, and took the opportunity to embezzle more than 11,000 catties of public grain (mostly grain coupons). During the village financial rectification this time, Guo was finally squeezed out and handed over to the government for execution. In Shibi Village, Wuxiang, a total of seven feudal landlords and rich peasant households were squeezed out, and 600,000 yuan of village public property was cleared out.
    Licheng adopted the method of mass discussions and self-reporting, guiding the masses to discuss: "Who does the village public property belong to?" Enlightening the class consciousness of the peasants, recognizing that "in the old society, things that exploited us peasants were used to build temples and statues to rule us peasants again!" After financial rectification, the peasants of Shangyao Village in the county immediately shouted: "We want to take back our things from Wang Shuen and Wang Shaowen, who suppressed the community in the village!" However, because some peasants also kept public grain and public property in the past, and were afraid of anti-corruption and did not dare to self-report, the leadership promptly proposed: "Landlords who embezzle public property will be fought against, and peasants who save public property and self-report will be rewarded!" "Squeeze out the feudal elements, and our family will manage finances together!" In this way, in two days, Zaozhuang Town organized and arranged public property worth 200,000 yuan.
    Because poor and hired peasants are most oppressed by the village community, remember the property plundered by landlords most clearly, and are easily enlightened to rectify finances consciously, they have become the main force in financial rectification. For example, when Xiaozhai Village in Anyang mobilized for financial rectification, cadres, mostly middle peasants, said: "There is nothing left to rectify!" The poor peasant group immediately questioned: "The big things haven't been taken out yet!" "Where did the large cabinets and iron cages in the school go? The things of the two households of Wang Kuiren, who fled our village, have not been found?" "They can't escape our Xiaozhai Village!" Insisting on financial rectification, as a result, more than 490,000 yuan was cleared out in five days. During the financial rectification, the difficulty of not being able to figure out the bottom line often occurred. Fifty Mu Village in Licheng adopted the method of holding meetings of old people (especially poor and hired old people) to "visit community property," and smoothly cleared out the village community property from thirty years ago, including the fines and forfeits preserved by the three gambling ban societies, Bagua Zhai, Wulong Society, and Sanguan Society, with a total value of 250,000 yuan. At first, the cadres of Linzhang Village in Lucheng felt that the village was small and there was nothing to rectify, but when the poor and hired knew that the 40 dan of rice spent by the village was taken from the fruits of the struggle, they unanimously protested and said: "Our 28 households of fruit sharers have each shared one dan less grain," and resolutely demanded that the village finances be rectified.
    The slogan of Xinsi Village in Cixian is: "Whether there is anything or not, let the poor peasants speak!" making the financial rectification work go deeper.

　　“有啥没啥，贫农说话”
  　太行整财获新进展
    【本报综合讯】太行区整理村财政近获新进展，其特点是以贫雇为主，结合挤封建进行大清仓整理村财政，获得许多前所未有的成绩。过去许多地主、富农潜入村财政机构，贪污破坏。安阳一区仓库主任及委员四十八人中，就有八个地主、三个富农。该县小寨村仓库主任郭文书，是个破落地主。他借仓库主任的职位，大秤进小秤出，在秤锤上加铁圈，每万斤粮食多收三百斤，前年蒋特阴谋暴动，他偷将公粮三千斤供给暴动分子，去年蒋军进犯水冶，他故意扣着粮食不发，结果损失了公粮三千七百斤，并乘机贪污了公粮（多为粮票）一万一千多斤。这次该村整理村财政时，终将郭某挤出来，送交政府处决。武乡石鼻村共挤出封建地主、富农七户，清出村公产六十万元。
    黎城采取群众座谈，自报方法，引导群众讨论：“村公产是谁的东西？”启发农民的阶级自觉，认识到“旧社会剥削咱农民的东西，修盖庙宇神像，再来统治咱农民！”该县上窑村农民经过理财自觉后，立即喊出：“向当村压社的王树恩、王绍文要回咱们的东西！”但由于过去部分农民也保存有公粮、公产，怕反贪污不敢自报，领导上便及时提出：“地主贪污公产和他展开斗争，咱们农民保存公产自报还有奖！”“挤出封建，咱一家人来理财！”这样，枣庄镇两天功夫，便将价值二十万元的公产整理就绪。
    由于贫雇农民，受村社压迫最大，对地主所掠夺的财物记得最清楚，整财自觉容易启发，成为整财的主力。如安阳小寨村动员整财时，干部多为中农说：“没有整的了！”贫农小组马上提出质问说：“大东西还没有拿出来哩！”“学校里的大柜、铁笼那里去了？咱村逃亡户王奎仁两户的东西也没找见？”“总跑不出咱小寨村！”坚持整财，结果五天中清理出四十九万余元。在整财时，常发生摸不清底子的困难，黎城五十亩村便采取开老人（特别是贫雇老人）会“访社物”的办法，将三十年前的村社物产、很顺利地清理出来，计有三个禁赌社八卦斋、五龙社、三官社所保存的罚粮、罚款，总值二十五万元。潞城临漳村干部起初觉得村小没有什么可整的了，但当贫雇知道村开支的四十石米，是从斗争果实中取来的，一致提出抗议说：“我们二十八户分果实户，每户少分了一石粮”，坚决要求把村财政整理出来。
    磁县辛寺庄的口号是：“有啥没啥，贫农说话！”使整财工作走向深入。
