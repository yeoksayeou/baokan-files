　　British Labour Party Parliamentary Delegation Statement
  　Britain Should Cooperate with Eastern Europe
    From Dependence on the United States
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th] Belgrade Dispatch: The British Labour Party parliamentary delegation led by the left-wing Labourite Zilliacus issued a statement at a press conference on the 8th stating that the delegation's "purpose in this informal visit is to investigate the possibility of political and economic cooperation between Britain and Eastern European countries"; and stated: "Britain has little hope for the Marshall Plan, therefore, trade with planned economies is of great significance to Britain. This trade will free Britain from dependence on American capital." The statement strongly asserted: "Western European countries cannot overcome their crises if they cannot establish friendly relations with Eastern European countries in all aspects of politics and economics." The statement criticized the Truman Doctrine, emphasized the importance of "forming friendship and cooperation into an insurmountable fortress against warmongers," and pointed out: "The British people do not need war." The statement also praised the splendid achievements of the people of South [Yugoslavia] in their democratic unity, reconstruction, and work. The delegation arrived in South [Yugoslavia] on the 4th, following a visit to Czechoslovakia.

　　英工党议会代表团声明
  　英国应与东欧合作
    从对美国的依赖下解放出来
    【新华社陕北十二日电】贝尔格莱德讯：由英工党左派人士齐里亚库斯所率领的英工党议会代表团，于八日记者招待会上发表声明称：该团“此次非正式访问之目的，在考察英国与东欧国家在政治与经济上合作之可能性”；并称：“英国对于马歇尔计划甚少希望，因此与计划经济国家进行贸易一事，对英国实具有重大意义。此项贸易将使英国从对美国资本之依赖下获得解放。”声明力称：“西欧国家如不能与东欧国家建立政治经济各方面之友好关系，即不能克服其危机。”声明抨击杜鲁门主义，强调“形成对战争贩子的不能摧越之堡垒的友谊和合作”的重要性，并指出：“英国人民不需要战争”。声明亦盛赞南国人民之民主统一及复兴与工作之辉煌成就。该代表团系继访问捷克之后于四日抵南者。
