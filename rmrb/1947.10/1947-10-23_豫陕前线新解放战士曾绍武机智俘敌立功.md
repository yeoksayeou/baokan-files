(Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 19th) Zeng Shaowu, a former soldier of the Chiang Kai-shek army liberated from Shanzhou City, has joined the People's Liberation Army and performed meritorious service in the Temen battle. Zeng Shaowu, a telephone operator from the 165th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek army, joined the Liberation Army after being liberated in Shan County. During the Temen battle, he went out alone with five hand grenades to retrieve a wire. He happened upon five Chiang bandits, so he threw two hand grenades and shouted at the Chiang bandits to surrender their guns. When the Chiang bandits refused, he suddenly became unusually clever and shouted to the rear: "Get the heavy machine gun over here to fire!" This scared the enemy, who quickly surrendered their guns. He captured five prisoners single-handedly and seized three rifles and two head of livestock. Wang Baoqing, an artillery company soldier who was also liberated during the Shanzhou battle, was so eager to catch up with the Chiang bandits during this pursuit that he carried his cannon on his back instead of waiting for a pack animal, chasing them for more than ten miles. The unit specially awarded him a commendation.

(Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 13th) Yuxi Front News: The Qingshui mass participation group has organized a propaganda team to conduct propaganda in the new Yuxi area. The team, consisting of more than twenty people, is divided into four groups, going everywhere to whitewash Chiang bandit slogans, rewrite our army's new slogans, and conduct door-to-door oral propaganda. For example, when they first arrived in Lizhai Village, the masses were afraid that the Chiang bandits would return to the village, and only some old men and old women remained. The propaganda team comrades talked to the old men and women and convened a meeting of twenty or thirty of them, publicizing our policies and exposing the enemy's deception and oppression, making the masses realize that the Liberation Army is the savior of the people, saying, "They are truly our people." Then they called back the young women. Once, after they conducted propaganda in Dongling Pass (five li from the enemy), it prompted a teacher to denounce the Chiang bandits for raping his daughter-in-law, cursing the Chiang bandits for losing their humanity. Comrade Song Qian, the squad leader, also helped the masses with the autumn harvest, harvesting two mu of cotton at once, which moved the masses even more. They are now mobilizing the masses in various villages to help the masses in the new area stand up.

　　豫陕前线新解放战士曾绍武机智俘敌立功
    【本报太岳十九日电】由陕州城解放之蒋军战士已参加解放军，在铁门战斗立功。某部电话员曾绍武原在蒋军一六五旅当电话兵，在陕县被解放后就参加了解放军，在铁门战斗中他一个人带了五颗手榴弹出去收线，恰巧有五个蒋匪过来，他就投出两颗手榴弹；喝令蒋匪缴枪。蒋匪不肯，他忽然变得从来未有的机智向后面喊道：“给我把重机枪抬过来打！”把敌人吓唬住了，赶快缴了枪，一人捉了五个俘虏，缴了三枝步枪，两头牲口。炮兵连战士王宝清也是陕州战斗中才解放过来的，在这次追击蒋匪时因为等不及驮炮就背着炮追，一直追了十几里，该部特给记功一次。
    【本报太岳十三日电】豫西前线讯：沁水参战群众组织宣传队在豫西新区进行宣传。该队共二十余人，分成四个组，到处洗刷蒋匪标语，重写我军新的标语，并按户进行口头宣传。如初到李寨村，群众怕蒋匪来村，只剩一些老头子和老太太，宣传队同志就在老汉和老婆中进行谈话，并召集了二三十个老汉和老婆开会，宣传我们的政策，揭露敌顽欺骗压迫，使群众认识到解放军是人民的救星，说：“真是咱的人。”接着就把青年妇女都叫回来。有一次他们在东岭关（离敌五里地）宣传后，引起一个教员控诉蒋匪强奸他的儿媳，骂蒋匪失掉人性。小队长宋谦同志并帮助群众收秋，一次就收棉花二亩，更使群众感动。现在他们正在各村发动群众，帮助新区群众翻身。
