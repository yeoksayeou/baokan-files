Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Chiang Kai-shek's Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, who was in the United States negotiating a "loan" with the US government, is on his way back to China. Wang arrived in Tokyo on the 23rd and began consultations with MacArthur that same day. It is said that he will stay in Tokyo for four days to "meet" with Japanese authorities. Wang went to the United States in early September to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York, but his main task was to conduct "loan" negotiations with the US authorities. During the UN General Assembly, Wang constantly held secret talks with Marshall, who was also attending the conference, regarding the "loan," and even went to Washington to "consult" directly with Truman. According to various sources, the content of the negotiations focused on the loan conditions: First, the use of the loan would be supervised by the United States, a point to which Chiang's side has agreed. According to an Associated Press report from Nanjing on the 17th, the Chiang Kai-shek government "believes that any economic and financial assistance must be accompanied by supervision, advice, and technical assistance." The report also mentioned Bullitt's proposal to appoint MacArthur as the chief supervisor of aid to Chiang, in order to establish a reactionary plan for the purpose of destroying China through a US-Japan-Chiang system, saying: "It is generally believed that Chiang particularly values MacArthur's prestige." It is widely believed that Wang Shijie's meeting with MacArthur in Tokyo is related to this. Second, the US government's demand that the Chiang government "renounce its veto power" regarding the Chiang government's attitude in the future peace treaty conference with Japan is also one of the loan conditions. A Central News Agency report from New York on the 22nd even reported that the United States would increase the proportion of Japanese reparations allocated to Chiang's side in order to induce Chiang to completely comply with the US government's intentions in the peace treaty with Japan. Third, the Chiang side should assist in strengthening the US position in the Shandong Peninsula and Manchuria. Chiang's bandit forces invaded Yantai in early October and immediately invited the US Navy to station there, which was a special step taken to satisfy the US desires. During his talks with Truman and Marshall, Wang Shijie specifically conveyed Chiang Kai-shek's views on Manchuria. A report from Nanjing by New York Times reporter Leibman on the 16th emphasized that "Americans in China believe that Manchuria is of great importance to the US position in the Pacific, so there must be a large-scale aid program in order to achieve any effective results." This clearly illustrates the United States' aggressive greed for Manchuria. In short, this "loan" negotiation is based on the further betrayal of China's territorial, political, economic, and diplomatic sovereignty. According to Chiang-controlled newspapers, the loan amount is around ten billion US dollars, which is similar to the amount proposed in the "Butt Plan." It is rumored that Truman has approved it, and in order to reduce procedural troubles, a "political loan" method will be adopted.

　　蒋介石进一步出卖国家主权
  　乞灵美国金元打内战
    王世杰奔波华盛顿奴相可鄙
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】在美与美国政府进行“贷款”谈判之蒋匪外交部长王世杰，已在返华途中。王二十三日抵东京，当日即开始与麦克阿瑟会商。据称彼将在东京勾留四日，以便与日本当局“会晤”。王氏系于九月初旬赴美出席纽约联合国大会者，但其中心工作却在与美国当局进行“贷款”谈判。王曾在联合国大会期间与出席大会之马歇尔不断进行关于“贷款”之秘密商谈，中间并赴华盛顿与杜鲁门直接“商谈”。据各方消息披露的谈判内容仅在于贷款条件：第一，贷款之使用由美国监督，此点蒋方已予同意。据美联社南京十七日电称，蒋匪政府方面，“深信任何经济与财政援助，必须伴以监督、顾问与技术援助”。该消息并提及布立特主张以麦克阿瑟为援蒋总监督，以便建立以亡华为目的之美日蒋体系的反动计划说：“一般深信蒋特别看重麦克阿瑟的威信”。众信王世杰在东京与麦克阿瑟之会商与此有关。第二，为未来对日和约会议中蒋政府态度问题，美政府要求蒋政府“放弃否决权”亦为贷款条件之一。中央社二十二日纽约消息，更传出美国将提高日本赔偿中蒋方所占比例，以诱使蒋在对日和约中完全遵从美政府意旨。第三，为蒋方应协助加强美国在山东半岛及满洲之地位。十月初蒋匪侵占烟台，并立即邀请美国海军进驻此地，即为满足美国愿望所作之特别步骤。王世杰在与杜鲁门、马歇尔商谈中，曾特别转达蒋介石对满洲之观点，美国纽约时报记者莱勃曼十六日自南京发出之报导中，曾强调“在华之美国人士认为满洲对美国太平洋地位有很大的重要性，所以必须有一个庞大的援助计划，以便获得任何有效的结果”。此点清楚说明美国对满洲之侵略贪欲。总之，此次“贷款”谈判系以中国领土、政治、经济及外交主权之进一步出卖为条件。据蒋区报纸消息称：贷款数目在十亿美元左右，与“布特，计划”所拟数目相近，传杜鲁门已予批准，并为减少手续麻烦，将采“政治贷款”方式。
