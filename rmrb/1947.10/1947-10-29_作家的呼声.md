　　A Writer's Call
    爱伦堡 (Ehrenburg)
    This article by the famous Soviet writer Ehrenburg was originally published in the Soviet newspaper Pravda on October 4th. What is published here is an abstract of the original.
　　——Editor

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    The Soviet people, both in the past and now, have never held a hostile attitude towards the people of other countries. Soviet people pay attention to the distant American life with friendly feelings. Our soldiers welcomed the American allied forces on the Elbe River in Germany. In any case, we Soviet people are happy because we are the victorious people. We would like to forget the tragedy of 1942, when the Soviet people constantly fought and bled against the German bandits, while the United States continued to make a fortune. But when our writers arrived in the United States, they never fabricated rumors, nor did they put forward attitudes that aroused hatred; on the contrary, they also explained all the good characteristics of the American people.

    American Lords Attempt to Use Weapons Instead of Reasoning

    If we are now forced to scold the dark deeds done by certain white people, it is because American imperialists are threatening the world.

    On August 18, Harriman delivered a speech at the Chamber of Commerce in ×× City. During the war, Mr. Harriman was the US ambassador to Moscow. He had seen the sorrow and pride of the Russian people. He knew very well that we were able to win the war because we loved peace and hated those who played with war. However, Mr. Harriman, in a city chamber of commerce that made a fortune during the war, babbled about the "Soviet threat" to their peace, saying that the United States should rise up to fight against the "Soviet expansion of power," and said that the United States had prepared sufficient atomic bombs. War instigators advocate the use of atomic bombs only because some Americans do not like our social system. But who likes what is completely unnecessary to argue about. But American lords are trying to use weapons instead of reasoning. The American social system does not arouse our praise. For example, we believe that their tricks of racial division and the slave system existing in the southern states of the United States are really an insult to personality; but no matter how different our just demands are from the United States, we never want to destroy American cities.

    The United States, Which Calls for War, Shouts Humanitarianism

    During the war years, the United States said many beautiful things, saying that "all peoples should enjoy their right to free life"; after winning the victory, they added the following correction: "All peoples have the power to enjoy American trusteeship." In China, Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines, many very naive people believed in the Atlantic Charter, but they paid the price of noble bloodshed for their naivety. After the European countries were liberated under the iron hooves of Hitler, the frequently mentioned Communist Party developed rapidly in European countries and became a powerful people's party. The reason why the Communist Party was ahead of others was only because they were always the vanguard of the people during the difficult struggle. In many countries, coalition governments with the participation of Communists were established, so American tycoons thought of going there to "restore order." They decided to open the door of Europe to allow it to enjoy the "benevolence" of the United States, which is the same thing as the "benevolence" given by American believers to Palestine. Europe suffered famine, and the United States quickly clamored for "help." They can be regarded as generous. They first gave Greece a hunger-relieving gift. In France and Italy, the Americans said: If the Communists in the government can be driven out, then they will be able to get food and coal. And American politicians also said: "The Soviet Union is interfering in other people's affairs." This is like a thief shouting "catch the thief" next to him. The United States does not like to believe in God, but it often begs God, and when it illegally executes black people, it says it is "merciful and benevolent." Therefore, it is not surprising that the United States, which calls for war, shouts humanitarianism.

    American Ambitionists Want to Treat the Near East as a Suburb of New York City

    The United States says they are "defending American security," but no one dares to believe that Yugoslavia is threatening New York; no one will believe that the United States cannot sleep soundly unless Yugoslavia becomes American territory. Regarding the administration of Trieste, Yugoslavia and Italy have been arguing for a long time. Everyone knows that Italians and Yugoslavs live in this city. American imperialists believe that it is a territory easy to get their hands on, and it can become a good US military base. American newspapers vigorously advocate that American interests have always existed in the Mediterranean; the United States has taken a fancy to the seaports of Greece and Turkey. In the past, Mussolini made the Mediterranean an Italian inland sea. Now, American ambitionists regard the entire Near East as a suburb of New York, and the Mediterranean is an American inland lake. At the same time, American ambitionists loudly shout that "the Soviet Union is invading other people's territory" and "interfering in other people's affairs." People of all countries know: some people are carrying out aggression, while others are contributing their strength to encourage others; some people are plundering other people's property, while others are giving selfless help. Everyone knows who speculated and made a fortune during the war, and who bravely killed the enemy under the city of Stalingrad.

    The American People Yearn for Peace, but Warmongers Deceive Them

    The American people, like all other people, yearn for peace. If they cannot distinguish the warmongers in their country, it is only because their journalists fabricate rumors and confuse right and wrong every day, deceiving many Americans so that they are at a loss. They promote to the Americans that they are under the threat of Russians, Yugoslavs, and Albanians. In fact, newspaper bandits are threatening Americans. Any imperialist is very dangerous to the world. They regard their artistic foundation as a noble success of mankind. I have never denied the significance of art at any time, and I also like comfortable conditions and beautiful things. I firmly believe that machines are useful in people's lives, but the cultural level of a country cannot be estimated by the number of cars. You should not talk about this with people sitting in cars. I do not deny that American washing machines are better than ours, but I firmly oppose people who worship washing machines and new fountain pens. A bad pen that can write good characters is probably nobler than a person who cannot write with a new fountain pen. (To be continued)

　　作家的呼声
    爱伦堡
    苏联名作家爱伦堡所作这篇文章，原登载于十月四日苏联真理报上，这里所发表的是原文的摘要。　　　
　　——编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    苏联人民无论过去和现在对其他各国人民都没有抱着仇视的态度，苏联人都以友好的感情注意遥远的美国生活。我们的兵士在德国易北河欢迎美国盟军。不论怎样，我们苏联人民是快乐的，因为我们是胜利的人民。我们情愿忘记一九四二年的惨状，当时苏联人民不断与德寇斗争流血，而美国不断大发其财。但是我们到了美国的作家，无论什么时候，都没有造过谣言，都没有提出过引起仇恨的态度；反之他们还解释美国人民一切良好的特点。
    美国老爷企图玩弄刀枪来代替讲道理
    假使我们现时迫不得已要来骂某些白种人所干的黑暗勾当，那是因为美国帝国主义者在威胁世界。
    八月十八日哈立曼在××城商会上发表演说，在战争时期，哈立曼先生是美国驻莫斯科大使，他曾看到过俄国人民的悲哀和自傲，他很清楚的知道我们之所以能打胜仗，因为我们爱好和平和痛恨玩弄战争的人。可是哈立曼先生在战争时期发了大财的城市商会上，胡说什么“苏联威胁”他们的和平，说美国应当起来斗争，反对“苏联扩展势力”。并说美国准备了充分的原子炸弹。战争挑拨者主张采用原子弹，只是因为某些美国人不喜欢我们的社会制度。但是谁喜欢什么东西，完全是用不着争论的。可是美国老爷们企图玩弄刀枪来代替讲道理。美国的社会制度不会引起我们赞扬，比如我们认为他们那里有划分人种把戏，和美国南部省份所存在的奴隶制度，实在说是侮辱人格；但是无论我们的正义主张与美国怎样不同，我们绝不想去毁灭美国的城市。
    号召战争的美国却高叫人道主义
    在战争年代，美国说了许多漂亮的话，说“各国人民都应当享受其自由生活的权利”；在获得胜利后，他们加上了以下的更正：“各国人民都有享受美国托管的权力。”在中国、朝鲜、越南、菲律宾，许多十分幼稚的人们，相信大西洋宪章，但是他们对于自己的幼稚，着实付了高贵流血的代价。欧洲各国在希特勒铁蹄下获得解放后，常被人们提起的共产党，在欧洲各国有迅速的发展，从而成了强大的人民的政党，共产党之所以在别人的前面，只是因为在艰苦的斗争时期，他们经常是民众的先锋。在许多国家中都成立有共产党人参加的联合政府，因此美国财主们就想到那里去“整顿秩序”。他们决定打开欧洲的门户，使其享受美国的“恩惠”，与美国教徒给巴力斯坦的“恩惠”是同样的一会事。欧洲遭受饥荒，美国连忙口口声声“帮助”，他们可算是宽宏大量，他们首先给予希腊充饥，在法国、意大利，美国人这样说：假使能把在政府中共产党人赶出去，那么他们就能够得到粮食和煤炭。并且美国政客也这样说：“苏联在干涉别人的事情”。这正象小偷在旁边叫喊捉小偷一样。美国不喜欢信神，却常乞求上帝，非法处死黑人的时候，竟说是“慈悲仁爱”。因此号召战争的美国，高叫人道主义是没有什么奇怪的。
    美野心家想把近东当做纽约市的近郊
    美国说他们为“保卫美国的安全”，但是无论谁都不敢相信南斯拉夫在威胁纽约；谁也不会相信，假使南斯拉夫不变成美国的领土，美国是不能高枕无忧的。关于管理的里雅斯特，南斯拉夫和意大利曾争论很久，大家知道，住在这个城市有意大利人和南斯拉夫人，美国帝国主义者认为，是容易弄到手中的地盘，那里能成为良好的美军基地，美国报纸大力鼓吹在地中海历来就存在美国人的利益；美国眼中看中了希腊和土耳其的海港，从前黑索里尼把地中海成为意大利的内海，现在美国野心家把整个近东当做纽约的近郊，而地中海是美国的里湖，美国野心家同时并高声叫喊说什么“苏联侵占别人的领土”，“在干涉别人事情”，各国人民都知道：一部分人在实行侵略，另一部分人却贡献自己力量鼓励别人；一部份人在抢夺别人财物，而另一部分人正在给予大公无私的帮助。大家知道谁在战争时期做投机买卖，发了大财，谁在斯大林格勒城下英勇杀敌。
    美国人民渴望和平好战分子欺骗他们
    美国人民与其他各人民同样渴望和平，假使他们辨别不了国内好战分子，这只是因为他们的新闻记者捏造谣言，每天在混乱是非，把许多美国人欺骗得莫明其妙，他们向美国人宣传，处在俄国南斯拉夫阿尔巴尼亚人威胁之下。而实际上，报纸土匪在威胁美国人。任何的帝国主义者，对于世界都是很危险的，他们把自己的艺术基础认为是人类的高尚成功。无论在什么时候，我都没有否认艺术的意义，我也喜欢舒服的条件和漂亮的东西，我坚决相信机器在人的生活中有用处，但不能以汽车数量来估计某个国家的文化水平。关于这点你不要和坐在汽车上的人们谈论。我不否认美国洗衣机比我们的好，但是我坚决反对崇拜洗衣机和新自来水笔的人们。坏笔可写好字的人，恐怕要比拿着新式自来水笔写不成字的人要高贵的多。（未完）
