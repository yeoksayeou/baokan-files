[Reported by this newspaper from a compilation of news from Bo'ai] The 150,000 liberated peasants of the entire county held district-level rallies celebrating the arrival of our army's major counter-offensive, setting off an earth-shattering movement to join the counter-offensive army. From the afternoon of the 19th to dusk on the 20th, within a day and a half, 1,730 liberated young people voluntarily enlisted. Meritorious cadres proposed: "The large army has reached the Yangtze River. We must expand the army and cooperate with the victorious counter-offensive army to take Jiao'zuo, recover Xinxiang, capture the traitor Wang Delin alive, and defend the peasants' state!" Consequently, under the leadership of meritorious personnel and cadres, an enthusiastic enlistment movement was launched. Within a day and a half, each district successively exceeded its original plan, and many exemplary and moving stories emerged. Li Yutian, a liberated peasant from Beishizi Village, heard the call to enlist in the army to recover Jiao'zuo and defend Qinghua. He voluntarily signed up at the village meeting to send his son to the army. He said, "I used to be a pauper, with nothing. Now I have become a middle peasant and have everything. Without the Eighth Route Army, I wouldn't have such a good life. I have two sons, and I want to send them to fight Lao Jiang, to have my sons protect the country." Under his call, four or five parents immediately signed up to send their children to join the victorious army on the spot. Cao Xisheng's mother from Dayan Village in the Third District said on stage, "I used to live in a temple and suffer poverty, I was an old impoverished person, often beaten and scolded by the landlords, unable to find food. Thanks to the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army for allowing us poor old women to turn over, now I have a house to live in, good land to cultivate, and clothes to wear. I am willing to send my son Xisheng to join the army, to take Jiao'zuo, so that everyone can enjoy peace." At the enlistment meeting in the First District, militiaman Liang Yonghe said: "In order to defend my hometown and protect our fruits of victory, now I am an Eighth Route Army soldier, but not yet a Communist Party member. I request to join the Communist Party, and I will never return until Chiang is defeated and Nanjing is recovered!" In the Second District, more than 170 outstanding young people in the entire district have voluntarily enlisted. Wu Laizhang said, "The Eighth Route Army liberated Bo'ai two years ago and led me to turn over, recovering my houses, land, and bamboo gardens. I think Chairman Mao is even better than my grandfather. Now we have gained the fruits of victory, and I want to join the army and go to the front line. I will not return until Chiang is defeated!" Following him, He Laiyou and other thirteen liberated young people, remembering the suffering of the past and the liberation of today, voluntarily enlisted. A young student also automatically signed up. At the district-wide enlistment meeting in the Fourth District on September 19, Wang Jiao'shi from Zhaibuchang sent his son to join the army and mobilized his two nephews to lead eleven young people to sign up voluntarily. He said, "In the past, Wang Delin made my children do dishonorable things. Now, joining the victorious army is the most honorable, because it is for the people. Therefore, I am telling my nephews and sons to go fight Lao Jiang and capture Wang Delin alive, so that we can all enjoy peace!" Following this, the women's chairman of Chejiazu sent her man to join the army and said, "My man is fighting Chiang Kai-shek and capturing Wang Delin alive at the front, and I am leading the women in the rear to dig up Chiang's roots and establish a women's militia to bring glory to the whole family!" The militia instructor of Xue Village said, "I want to join the army, fight to Jiao'zuo, capture Wang Delin, and cut off his head to show everyone!"
