    Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 25th: After capturing Guangji County on the morning of the 21st, a unit of the People's Liberation Army pressed southward, directly towards the Yangtze River. On the 22nd, they captured the important town of Wuxue in one fell swoop. A Chiang Kai-shek bandit warship on the river surface fired three shots in vain and fled. We annihilated a part of the Chiang Kai-shek diehard security police, killing more than 20 enemies, capturing 60 people and rifles, and seizing many other spoils of victory. Another unit of our army simultaneously recovered Huangmei County for the second time. Part of the defending enemy, the Youth Army's 203rd Division, fled southward, and we are in pursuit. Thus, the river defense stretching over 300 li from Huayang Town (east of Wangjiang) in the east to Jinchun in the west, and the vast area, are all under our army's control. The People's Liberation Army has now gained a favorable position and can cross the river southward at any time to strike directly at Chiang Kai-shek's bandit den.

    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二十五日电】人民解放军某部于二十一日晨攻克广济县城后，乘胜南下，直逼长江，二十二日一举攻占武穴重镇，该处江面蒋匪兵舰一艘虚发三炮，回头便逃。我歼灭蒋顽保安警察一部毙敌二十余名，俘获人枪六十，缴获其他胜利品甚多。另部我军于同时第二次收复黄梅县城，守敌青年军二零三师一部南窜，我正追击中。至此，东迄华阳镇（望江以东）西至靳春，长达三百余里之江防及广大地区全为我军控制。人民解放军现已取得有利态势，随时可以渡江南下，直捣蒋匪巢穴。
