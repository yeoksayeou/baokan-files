　　Overcoming Ideological Obstacles and Solving Specific Difficulties
  　Nantianhe Promotes Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting Experience

    [This dispatch from Changzhi] Under the leadership of model Party member and labor hero Cao Linshui, Nantianhe's autumn harvest and wheat planting have formed a movement. Now, all 301.5 mu of grain fields in the Linshui Brigade have been harvested, and all 483 mu of regular wheat in the village have been planted. In addition, 113 mu of inter-cropped wheat have been planted, with the Linshui Brigade planting 34 mu and Xiajie exceeding 23 mu. The following are some experiences: (1) Resolving ideological obstacles and starting early. After the cadres returned from the meeting, the Linshui Brigade harvested more than 50 mu in one day, while others did not move. After discovering this problem, an activists' meeting was held at night to study the reasons. The masses were unwilling to harvest together because they felt they should take a break. Old man Cao Xinglong said, "Harvesting autumn is not an urgent matter. Harvest the grain first, then the corn, and then plow the land. This is like rushing to grab something." When they went to ask Yu Bao's wife to work in the fields, she said, "Watching you go back and forth, like a warrant server (a person who delivers summons in the old government), it's as if we've committed some crime." At the same time, this problem also existed among the cadres and activists. Except for Cao Linshui, who harvested his own fields first, some people were unwilling to harvest first. After self-criticism, everyone agreed that the masses could not take action because the cadres and activists were not ideologically aligned. After the meeting, they should take the lead and use the Linshui Brigade's slogan as the slogan for the whole village: "Men carry a load, women carry a basket, seize the autumn and winter harvests and don't return home empty-handed." "If you want to win a battle, take your wife and children together, and strike first." Then, the next day, it became a hive of activity, with more than 120 mu harvested in one day. However, on the third day, it started to rain. At this time, the masses' thinking became chaotic. Some old men and women complained, saying, "We've never seen anyone harvest grain when the sky is already overcast. If it rains, it will rot!" Some who had not harvested felt they had gotten a bargain and were smug, saying, "We didn't harvest, and we're not afraid of rotting." After hearing this, the activists expressed distress, saying, "Taking the lead has made things worse, and the grain will rot in the ground." After discovering this, they organized the masses to discuss and overcome their complaints. They discussed what to do if it rained. After the discussion, everyone agreed to fight the rain and proposed two methods: one method was to cut the grain ears and bring them back on a slow, sunny day, and the other was to prop the grain stalks up, leaning three together, on a quick, sunny day, so that they wouldn't touch the ground and wouldn't sprout or rot. In one morning, the whole village propped up all 179 mu of grain. Although it didn't clear up on August 15th, it didn't rain either. Everyone said: We're not observing the 15th, we have to start early. Before noon on the 15th, each group went to the fields to harvest. (2) Equal and fair compensation improved labor efficiency, and a large number of auxiliary laborers were organized. Represented by the Linshui Brigade, they established a method of calculating work points, which would allow people to earn more work points if they worked harder, encouraging everyone's enthusiasm. Many activists also emerged during the movement. Linshui's mother was stronger than the average woman in her labor, and Qi Hao's mother was very active in calling people to the fields every day. (3) Timely resolution of specific problems. Shuangzhu and Linshui had a plot of land together. Shuangzhu was in the south, and Linshui was in the north. The southern end grew well, yielding 29 loads, while the northern end only yielded 24 loads. The ones that grew poorly were also lighter in weight. Initially, it was calculated as 12 points for both, but after discussion, it was decided that the northern end was undercounted by 2 points. Originally, the plan was to count 12 cut grains as one point, but because Linshui's grain was not growing well and was uneven, it was re-stipulated that 10 cut grains would be counted as one point, which was fairer.

　　打通思想障碍解决具体困难
  　南天河推进秋收改麦经验
    【本报长治讯】南天河在模范党员劳动英雄曹林水带领下，秋收改麦形成运动，现在林水大队三百零一亩五分谷地已全部割完，全村正茬麦四百八十三亩已全部种完，还种改茬麦一百一十三亩，林水大队已种了三十四亩，下街已超过二十三亩。并有以下几点经验：（一）解决思想障碍及早动手。干部开会回去，林水大队一天收了五十多亩，其他没动，发现这个问题以后，黑夜召开积极分子会研究原因，是群众不愿意收耕在一起，认为应当消停些，老汉曹兴龙说：“收秋就不是急事，割完谷再收玉茭，以后再犁地，现在这就和抢什么一样。”起好去叫玉保妻上地，人家说：“看你左一趟右一趟，和原差（旧政府里的叫票人）一样，我们又不是犯了什么法。”同时在干部积极分子中也存在着这种问题，除曹林水先收自己外，有一部分人也不愿先收，检讨以后，大家一致认为群众行动不起来，是干部积极分子思想不一致，开过会以后要积极带头并根据曹林水大队的口号作为全村的口号；“男人担一担，女人捎一篮，抢秋夺夏不空回家。”“想要打胜仗，孩子老婆一齐上，先下手为强。”接着第二天便轰起来了，一天割了一百廿多亩。但到第三天就下起雨来，这时群众思想混乱起来，有些老汉妇女埋怨起来说：“咱就没见过天已经阴了，还割谷哩，下起雨来非烂了不可！”有些没有割的觉得讨了便宜弄对了，表现侥幸说：“咱也没割了，咱也不怕烂了”。积极分子听到以后表现苦恼说：“带头带坏了，把谷烂在地里。”发现后就组织群众讨论，克服了埋怨情绪，讨论下了雨该怎办，讨论后一致说要和雨天作斗争，并提出两种办法，一种办法是慢晴天到地里把谷穗切回来，一种是快晴天到地里把谷子三个碰在一起竖起来，不挨土就不怕出芽了，也不怕烂了。一上午全村把一百七十九亩谷全都竖起来了，八月十五日虽没晴，但不下雨了，大家说：咱也不过十五，要趁早动手，十五前晌各组都上地割起来。（二）等价公道提高了劳动的效率，大量的组织辅助劳力。以曹林水大队等代表，他们订了折工记工办法，只要多干活，就能多顶工，鼓励了大家热劲。运动中也涌现许多积极分子，林水娘劳动上比一般妇女要强，起好娘每天很积极的叫人上地。（三）及时解决具体问题，双柱和林水是一块地，双柱在南头，林水在北头，南头长的好，担二十九担，北头只担了二十四担，长的不好分量也轻，开始算时都按十二分，后来经讨论北头少算了二分，切谷时原来计划十二个订一分，在切谷时因为林水谷长的不好，参差不齐，就又重规定切十个作一分，这样就公道了。
