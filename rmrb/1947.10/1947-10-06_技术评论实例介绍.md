Examples of four methods of "technical review" by Yang Xie Ling of the East China People's Liberation Army are explained below:

　　Individual Review
　　This method can be used when casualties in the unit are small but the combat situation is complex: that is, focusing on the individual and reviewing the techniques they demonstrated in combat. For example, the machine gun company of a certain battalion commented on the actions of Squad 1, Qi Zonggui, as follows: 1. When crossing an open area under enemy fire, he first moved from the fortifications to the village. After the squad leader and gunner carried the machine gun body sixty or seventy meters, he carried the frame and quickly rushed across, with swift movements. 2. As a combat team leader, carrying it alone cannot be sustained for long. 3. During the battle in a certain village, the squad leader and gunner moved the machine gun to high ground to fire, but Qi should not have remained concealed in the fortifications. This resulted in a shortage of personnel above to load bullets and observe. If an accident occurred, the machine gun would have been difficult to move. At the time, he also failed to report to the squad leader, which could have led to a loss of contact. In the future, if the machine gun leaves his position, he must report to the squad leader before concealing himself. 4. When engaging the enemy, the squad leader ordered them to collect sorghum stalks to conceal their fortifications. He ran to the wheat field stack to get them, exposing the target. At the time, he should have gotten them from the lower depression. If there were none, he should have concealed himself in the wheat field and dragged them down. 5. When the retreat order was given, he carried the frame and ran. Although the movement was fast, he should not have separated from the gun body. If the squad leader designated the end point of the retreat, he could quickly move ahead to reach it.

　　Comparative Review
　　This method can be adopted when the unit has no experience in reviewing, or when there are typical examples in the squad or platoon that can be compared with each other: such as the comparison of the combat actions of two soldiers from the sixth company, ninth squad: Zhao Wenxue and He Shifa simultaneously moved from a certain village to the north to monitor the enemy. At that time, the enemy had already begun to break out of the encirclement, one group going south along the road, located northeast of them, and another group going south to the village to the north. Zhao Wenxue was on the right, and He Shifa was on the left. They simultaneously crossed the open ground and occupied two graves in front. Zhao Wenxue was killed during the firefight with the enemy. The assessment was: 1. The attack movement was very swift, and the serpentine advance across the open ground was correct. 2. After occupying the graves, Zhao Wenxue simply shoveled two shovels of dirt, while He Shifa quickly dug concealed fortifications. 3. During the shooting, Zhao Wenxue's target search and observation of impact points were not concealed at all. He even stood up or knelt to shoot at times. When shooting at the enemy on the northeast highway, he did not pay attention to the enemy on the north side, resulting in being shot and killed by the enemy on the side. After He Shifa built the fortifications, he concealed himself on the side of the grave, and was not discovered by the enemy on either side. Moreover, when shooting at the enemy to the north, he frequently changed positions to observe, without staying in one place. However, although he had Zhao Wenxue to cooperate on the left side, he did not observe the enemy to the northeast, and his vigilance was insufficient.

　　Centralized Review
　　This method is used when education needs to be conducted based on the main problems of the unit at the time, or when individual reviews are not convenient: that is, formulating central content and conducting reviews in conjunction with examples. For example, the review of the actions of the "night mobile sentry" led by Duan Defa, the deputy of the sixth company, fifth squad. At that time, there was a mobile sentry of the third platoon on his right, and an observation post on his left. The mobile area was two hundred meters, and extended two hundred meters beyond the position. While moving, the three of them crowded together, and only noticed after an old man had passed by. He shouted "Who" and fired a shot. Everyone commented as follows: 1. The three should not crowd together, making rustling noises in the wheat, which hindered hearing. They should spread out in a triangle, and lighten their steps, so the target is smaller and they can hear further. 2. The three people should divide the aspects and scope of listening. 3. When a sound is detected, they should lie down, with one person listening, and the other two paying attention to both sides. Only paying attention to one point is incorrect. 4. If a situation occurs, a person should be sent to report, while the others remain calm and concealed, and wait for the enemy to approach before firing volleys or throwing grenades, and then move the mobile sentry. They should load the guns before setting out, and prepare grenades. 5. If someone is found to be approaching, they should develop a triangular encirclement, and one person should interrogate them. If there are many people coming, one person should pay attention to the people in front, and the rest should pay attention to the people behind.

　　Practical Review
　　This can be used when there is no combat or no typical examples, or after combat reviews, when exercises and regular military studies need to be conducted: that is, determining the central content, first practicing, and then conducting reviews. For example, after the third company's combat review and summary, they took "attack and withdrawal from combat" as the center, and set up a hypothetical situation: in front of the starting point there is a grave, in the middle is an open space of one hundred meters, and another grave is occupied by the enemy, with a machine gun, and the village behind is also occupied by the enemy. The ninth squad was assigned to occupy the grave in front of the village to monitor the enemy. Later, the enemy approached from the left side, and they immediately retreated. After the ninth squad's exercise, all squads in the company commented and summarized as follows: Advantages of the movement forward: (1) The individual leapfrog formation was well dispersed. (2) The movement across the open ground was rapid. Disadvantages: Two people did not move well. One spent a long time digging fortifications in the open ground, and the other rested in the open ground without moving, and then suddenly pounced forward. Shortcomings of fortification: 1. The machine gun fortification built in the middle of the grave was too careless. It is better to build a sitting shooting fortification that is more durable and concealed. 2. The target was often exposed when building the fortifications. 3. The infantry prone shooting fortifications on the left and right sides of the stone pile need to be concealed in the wheat field. 4. A new soldier did not dig well, making it inconvenient to shoot, lacking a retaining wall, and instead digging a ditch, making it impossible to conceal himself. Advantages of the retreat: 1. The first group quickly reached the position designated by the squad leader and provided cover. 2. The two groups alternated cover in an orderly manner. Disadvantages: 1. When the second group retreated, a tall person did not crawl, often exposing the target. 2. The third group retreated in the wrong direction, facing the enemy directly, paying attention to the enemy flanking on the left, and forgetting to conceal themselves from the enemy in the stone pile in front. Due to this mistake, the entire squad took twenty minutes to complete the retreat.

　　From the above examples, it can be seen that "technical review" has three characteristics: (1) It is not only suitable for post-war reviews, but also for regular training. (2) The content is extensive, reviewing shortcomings on the one hand, and pointing out advantages on the other. (3) At the same time, it summarizes experience and draws improvement methods.

### 技术评论实例介绍

　　技术评论实例介绍
    华东解放军杨谢灵“技术评论”四种方法举例说明如下：
    各个
    在部队伤亡小而战斗情况复杂
    评论
    时可用此法：即以人为中心，评论其在战斗中所表现之技术。例如某营机枪连对一班戚宗贵的动作评论如下：一、通过敌火力封锁开阔地时，先从工事运动到庄子，待班长与射手将机枪身子扛走六七十米达后，他才扛起架子猛一跑突过去了，动作迅速。二、自己是战斗组长，光一个人独扛不能持久。三、在某庄战斗时，班长射手把机枪搬上高地打去了，戚不该还在工事里隐蔽，以致上面缺人压子弹和观察，如发生意外机枪就难搬走。当时又不报告班长，会失去联络。今后机枪离开自己，须预先报告班长再隐蔽。四、接敌时班长叫取秫秸隐蔽工事，他跑到麦田堆上去弄，暴露目标，当时应在下面洼地弄，如没有应到麦田隐蔽往下拖。五、撤退令一下，他扛着架子就跑，动作虽快，但不应脱离枪身，如班长指定退却终点可以快步先行到达。
    对比评论
    部队无评论经验，或班、排内有可相互对比之典型，采用此法：如六连九班两个战士战斗动作的对比：赵文学和何世法同时由某庄运动向北监视敌人，当时敌已开始突围，一路由公路向南，位于他俩东北，正北方有一股向南面庄子来。赵文学在右，何世法在左，同时通过开阔地占领正面两个坟堆。而在对敌射击中赵文学牺牲了。评定为：一、出击动作很迅速，通过开阔地时蛇形前进也对。二、占领坟堆后赵文学只简单地铲了两锹，何世法则迅速地挖了隐蔽工事。三、射击中赵文学找目标，观察其着点，均不隐蔽，甚至有时站起或跪着打枪，对东北公路上敌人射击时，对正北侧面敌未加警惕，以致为侧面敌击中牺牲。何世法工事挖好后靠坟堆一侧隐蔽，两面都不被敌发觉，且向北面之敌射击时经常转移位置观察，不在一地停留。但是他虽有赵文学在左侧配合，对东北敌未进行观察，警觉也不够。
    中心评论
    依据部队当时主要毛病需要进行教育，或不便作个人评论时即用此法：即拟出中心内容配合实例进行评论。如评论六连五班副段德法带的“夜间游动哨”动作，当时他右侧有三排游动哨，左侧有监视哨，游动面积为二百米达，伸出阵地也有二百米达远。游动时他们三人挤在一起，曾有一个老百姓走过了才发觉，他边喊“谁”就伸手打了一枪。大家评论如下：一、三人不应挤在一起使麦子嚓嚓作响，妨碍了听觉。应成三角形散开，脚步放轻，则目标小听得远。二、三个人应划分听的方面与范围。三、发现响声应伏下，由一人听，其他两人注意两侧，单注意一点是不对的。四、如发生情况应一面派人报告，其他沉着隐蔽，待敌接近时打排枪或炸弹，转移游动哨。出发时就应顶膛火，准备炸弹。五、发现有人过来应开展成三角包围形势，由一人查问。有多人来时应以一人注意前面的来人，其余注意来人后面。
    实习评论
    没有战斗或无典型或战斗评论后，须进行演习及平时军事学习均可运用：即确定中心内容，先实习再展开评论。例如三连在战斗评论总结后，即以“进攻与退出战斗”作为中心，设假情况：出发地前有一坟堆，中间为百米达到之开阔地，坟即另有一坟堆为敌占领，附机枪一挺，后面庄子也为敌所占据。指定九班占领庄前坟堆监视敌人，以后敌又从左侧迂迥而来，当即后撤。九班演习后，全连各班评论总结如下：运动前进优点：（一）各个跃进队形分散好。（二）通过开阔地动作迅速。缺点：有两个人动作不好，一个在开阔地花很长时间挖工事，一个在开阔地中休息后不转移，却猛然扑进。做工事的缺点：一、坟堆中间做的机枪工事太马虎，不如做坐射工事持久而隐蔽。二、做工事时经常暴露目标。三、石堆左右侧步兵卧射工事在麦田需要隐蔽。四、有一个新战士挖得不好，不便射击，缺脑墙土，反而铲挖一条沟，无法隐蔽。撤退的优点：一、第一组很快到达班长指定位置并进行掩护。二、两组轮番掩护有秩序。缺点：一、第二组下撤时有个大个子不是爬行，经常暴露目标。二、第三组撤错了方向，正对敌人，注意了左侧迂迥之敌，忘了对正面石堆之敌隐蔽。由于这一错误，影响整班须二十分钟才完成撤退。
    从以上实例可看出“技评”有三个特点：（一）不但适用于战后检讨，也适用于平时整训。（二）内容广泛，一面检讨缺点，一面又指出优点。（三）同时又总结经验，得出改进办法。
