The communist parties of nine European countries (Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, France, Italy) met in Warsaw a week ago. Representatives attending the meeting heard reports on the activities of the central committees of each party, discussed the international situation, and exchanged experiences and coordinated actions. Andrei Zhdanov, representative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a report on the international situation at the meeting. The meeting decided to establish an information bureau in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, to exchange experiences and coordinate actions among the parties, and issued a declaration on the international situation. At the same time, Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito and Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov also delivered important speeches and talks on the current world situation, respectively. These declarations, speeches, and talks provide historical documents on the world situation, becoming a major event of utmost importance in post-war international politics.

In these major documents, the formation of the two camps in the world today (imperialism vs. anti-democracy, anti-imperialism vs. democracy) and their completely opposite policies are deeply analyzed. The documents also call on the Communist Party to unite all peace and democratic forces to implement anti-imperialist solidarity, and to lead in all aspects (national politics, economy, and ideology) to resist the war and expansion policies of US imperialism and its allies in Britain and France, oppose the betrayal policies of the right-wing social parties (mainly in Britain and France) who are loyal helpers of imperialism, resolutely struggle to defeat all aggressive plans of imperialism headed by the United States, and unyieldingly struggle to defend peace and democracy, and to defend the sovereignty, independence, and freedom of the motherland. These documents are filled with unwavering confidence in the strength of the people's democratic and peaceful forces, and assert that "any plan of enslaving Eurasia" by imperialism "is bound to fail." The Warsaw Declaration clearly points out: "The main danger for the working class today is underestimating its own strength and overestimating the strength of the imperialist camp," and nothing else. The declaration made a brilliant analysis of the war cries of the imperialist warmongers, believing that such cries are merely "a means for them to intimidate nervous and unstable elements to extort concessions." It also powerfully pointed out: "There is a huge gap between the imperialists' attempts to launch a war and the possibility of organizing such a war." Because "the peoples of the world do not want war, and the forces for maintaining peace are so strong." In Dimitrov's speech, he further pointed out that the growing strength of the six major forces for defending peace is a reliable guarantee for stopping the instigation of a new war.

The Warsaw Conference was a sudden and serious blow to US and British imperialism and their running dogs in various countries, causing them to be caught off guard, "surprised," and to frantically shout the lie of "the revival of the Communist International." They fundamentally do not understand that in today's world, where the strength of communist parties in various countries has greatly developed, restoring the Communist International, which once played a great historical role, "would be a regression rather than a progress." (Truth Daily Editorial)

Another major event in the past week has been the awakening of the people in imperialist countries and the development of the movement to defend peace and democracy. The council of the powerful US public organization "Progressive Citizens of America" issued a statement fiercely attacking the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan," denouncing them as "threatening world unity and peace." Wallace's speaking tour from mid-September to early October, according to the American New Republic magazine, also achieved "unprecedented victory," with "enthusiastic audiences particularly welcoming Wallace's attacks on warmongers." This reflects the true feelings of the American people against war. The resolution of the grand annual meeting of the Anglo-Soviet Friendship Association further issued a call to strengthen Anglo-Soviet friendship and "effectively implement the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty," and they clearly recognized that "the major interests of the British people lie in friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union," and "the attempts of the enemies of peace against the Soviet Union are doomed to failure." At the annual meeting of the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress, which has 350,000 members, speakers unanimously condemned "American imperialist policies" and demanded that the government adopt an "independent policy." All of these truly represent the wishes and voices of the people of Britain, the United States, and Canada, and will become "a major factor in defending peace." (Dimitrov's words)

The UN General Assembly has been meeting for nearly a month, and is still proceeding slowly. On the one hand, due to the sabotage activities of the reactionary factions of the United States and other countries, there has been no achievement. But on the other hand, due to the firm position of the Soviet Union and other countries' delegations in defending the United Nations at the UN General Assembly, the US delegation's attempt to seize the leadership of the UN General Assembly "has failed." The "lukewarm response" to Marshall's proposal to establish a "Temporary Committee on Peace and Security" is the best example. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 共产党结合一切民主力量反帝保卫和平的力量足以制止战争

　　共产党结合一切民主力量反帝保卫和平的力量足以制止战争
    欧洲九个国家（苏、南、捷、波、保、罗、匈、法、意）的共产党代表，一周前曾集会华沙，参加会议各代表听取了各党中央委员会的活动情况报告，讨论了国际情势及交换经验与配合行动问题，苏联共产党代表日丹诺夫在会上发表了国际情势的报告。会议决定在南国首都贝尔格莱德成立一情报局，以便交换各党之经验和配合行动，并发表了关于国际形势的宣言。同时，南国总理铁托和保国总理季米特洛夫，也分别发表了目前世界局势的重要演说和谈话。这些宣言、演说和谈话，对世界局势提供了历史性的文献，成为战后国际政治中头等重要的一件大事。
    在这几大文献中，深刻的分析了今天世界上两个阵营（帝国主义与反民主、反帝国主义与民主）的形成及其完全相反的政策，并号召共产党结合一切和平民主的力量，实行反帝大团结。并在各方面（国家政治、经济与思想各方面）去领导以抵抗美帝国主义的战争与扩展政策，及其英法的同盟者，反对帝国主义忠实帮手右翼社会党（主要是英、法）的背叛政策，坚决地为击败以美国为首的帝国主义的一切侵略计划而斗争，不屈不挠地为保卫和平民主、保卫祖国的主权、独立与自由而斗争。这些文献对人民民主和平力量的强大，充满了必胜的信心，而对帝国主义“任何奴役欧亚的计划”，断定其“必遭失败”。华沙宣言中明确指出：“工人阶级今天的主要危险是低估了自己的力量与过高估计帝国主义阵营的力量”，而不是其他。对帝国主义战争贩子关于新战争的叫嚣，宣言作了精辟的分析，认为这种叫嚣，只是它们“恐吓神经脆弱与不稳定分子，用以诈取让步的一种手段”。并有力指出：“帝国主义者发动战争的企图与组织此种战争可能性之间有着巨大的距离。”因为“世界各民族都不希望战争，维护和平的力量是如此强大。”在季米特洛夫的谈话中，更指出了保卫和平的六支大军力量之日益壮大，乃是制止挑拨新战争的可靠保障。”
    华沙会议对于美英帝国主义及其在各国的走卒，是一个突然的严重打击，使得它们手忙脚乱，“惊讶不已”，慌张地喊叫“共产国际复活”的谎言。他们根本不了解在各国共产党力量大大发展的今天，恢复曾起过伟大历史作用的共产国际“将是退步而不是进步”。（真理报社论）
    过去一周另一重大事件，便是帝国主义国家内人民的觉悟与保卫和平民主的运动正在发展中。美国有力的公共团体“进步公民协会”理事会发表声明，猛烈攻击“杜鲁门主义”与“马歇尔计划”，斥之为“威胁世界团结与和平”。华莱士从九月中旬到十月初的旅行演说，据美国新共和杂志载称：也获得“空前的胜利”，“热情的听众对华氏攻击战争贩子之处特别欢迎”。这反映了美国人民反对战争的真正情绪。英苏友谊协会盛大年会的决议，更发出加强英苏友谊，“有效实行英苏同盟条约”的呼声，他们清楚地认识“英国人民的重大利益在与苏联友好合作”，而“和平敌人针对苏联的企图，注定要失败”。拥有会员三十五万的加拿大职工会联合会年会中，发言者亦一致痛斥“美国之帝国主义政策”，并要求政府采取“独立政策”。所有这些，真正代表了英美加三国人民的愿望与呼声，并将蔚为“保卫和平中的重大因素”。（季米特洛夫语）
    联大迄今为止，已开会近一月，仍在蹒跚中进行。一方面，由于美国等反动派的破坏活动，迄无任何成就。但另一方面，由于苏联等国代表团在联大保卫联合国之坚决立场，使美国代表团夺取联大的领导权的企图“已告失败”。马歇尔建议成立“和平安全临时委员会”所获得的“冷淡反响”，便是最好的例证。（新华社）
