　　The Truth About Zhai Shixian's Land Donation
  　Exposing Untrue News and "Keli Kong"
To the Editor:
    Regarding the issue of Zhai Shixian of Boyan, Wu'an "donating land," according to our understanding, the report published in the People's Daily at the time was completely inconsistent with the truth. Zhai Shixian is from a large landlord family with over 300 mu of land, more than 200 rooms, and a garden. He also has businesses in Kaifeng, Henan. His land was entirely managed by hired labor. His father, Zhai Hongwen, was a "prominent figure," and the masses knew that the Zhai family was a local tyrant in Boyan, with his father as the head. During the "July 7th Incident," his father took the whole family to Kaifeng, Henan, to engage in business as a capitalist. His land was distributed to relatives and family members for caretaking, and his family was managed by his elder sister. After the liberation of Wu'an, during the struggle to eliminate rent and clear debts, his family was slightly targeted, with only some silver dollars, rifles, pistols, and bullets being confiscated. Other properties were not touched. When Zhai Shixian returned home and saw his family being targeted, he was furious and immediately ordered his guards to call the village cadres over and scolded them severely, saying that whoever targeted him and took his things would have to return them. Because Public Security Officer Niu Decheng led the masses to target his family, he scolded the public security officer several times, scaring him so much that he dared not go out. He personally told County Secretary Wang Tingdong and the masses through the Party: "If you treat me as a landlord, I will treat you with the attitude of a landlord!" He also said: "I have always had prejudices against local cadres, and the Central Government stipulates that my family should be taken care of!" He still treated the village cadres with the same attitude he used to treat his family's laborers and tenants (these village cadres used to be his long-term workers and tenants), so the village cadres were even more afraid of him. At that time, the district was holding a meeting of village cadres, and when they heard about this, they were all indignant and organized all the district cadres to struggle against him. County Secretary Wang Tingdong, Branch Committee members Cao Xuede and Li Yuchang, and District Chief Yang Qingyi also protested to him, resolutely supporting the peasants. Seeing that things were not going well, Zhai changed his attitude and handed over the land to the masses only after he had picked out 30 mu of good land for himself. When the masses asked him for valuables and guns, he said: "I have no valuables or guns!" As a result, he took all the valuables away. Zhai Shixian's "land donation" was made under these circumstances. After the People's Daily published the "land donation" news, cadres in the Third District and village cadres and masses around Boyan Township discussed it, saying: "Cadres are still effective, and they encourage oppression of the masses in the newspaper." Some district cadres also raised opinions to the reporter Shi Hong, and Shi Hong's reply was: "Don't just look at this matter, the main thing is to influence other places."
    The above situation is completely true. It is the material personally spoken by Comrade Li Yuchang of the Third District Branch Committee and has been agreed to by County Secretary Wang Tingdong. (Zhang Yiying)
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    Editor's Note: Comrade Yiying's exposure is very good. To facilitate readers' comparative study, the original text of the news about Zhai Shixian's donation published on page two of our newspaper on August 2nd last year is attached below: Comrade Zhai Shixian, a teacher at Northern University, persuaded his family to donate some of their land, houses, and clothing to the village farmers' association, requesting that it be distributed to poor peasants to accelerate the implementation of the "land to the tiller" principle advocated by the Chinese Communist Party and Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The donated property included more than 200 mu of land, more than 200 rooms, and clothing and utensils worth several million yuan. Comrade Zhai's family is one of the three major landlords in Boyan Town, Wu'an County. He himself is a member of the Chinese Communist Party, a graduate of Waseda University in Japan, and formerly served as the propaganda section chief of the Taiyue Column of the Eighth Route Army. He is currently a teacher at Northern University. In a letter to the Wu'an County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, he said: "In order to realize the great ideal of 'land to the tiller' of our Party, I am willing to donate my land and houses to the hard-working peasants so that every peasant in the liberated area can quickly obtain the necessary conditions for production and accelerate the great leap forward of Chinese society." The Wu'an County Party Committee immediately replied expressing its welcome and called on cadres to take the lead in responding to this movement. The peasants of Boyan Town praised each other in the streets and alleys, saying: "He donated land to help us turn over, truly worthy of being a Communist Party member."

### 翟士贤献田真象　不真实的新闻与“客里空”之揭露

　　翟士贤献田真象
  　不真实的新闻与“客里空”之揭露编辑同志：
    关于武安伯延翟士贤“献田”问题，据我们了解，当时人民日报发表的，完全不符真象。翟士贤是个大地主家庭，有地三百多亩，房子二百余间，还有花园一座，河南开封有他买卖，土地完全是雇用人力经营，他父亲翟鸿文又是个“人物头”，群众都知道翟家在伯延是一霸，就是以他父亲为首。“七七事变”时，他父亲带着全家人口到河南开封经商当财东，他的土地分散到亲戚和本家当户照料，他的家庭由他姐姐来管理。武安解放后，在灭租清债斗争中，他的家庭稍微被斗，只清算出一些现洋和步枪、手枪、子弹，其他财产并没有动。而翟士贤回到家里一看家庭被斗，便气愤万分，马上让警卫员把村干部叫来大骂一顿，并说谁斗我，拿了我的东西还得退回来。公安员牛德成因为带领群众斗他家，他便把公安员骂了几次，吓的公安员不敢出门。他亲自给县书王庭栋同志和群众经党讲：“你们把我当成地主看，我就用地主态度对待你们！”并且还说：“我一贯的对地方干部就有成见，中央规定照顾我的家庭！”他对待村干，还是用过去对待他家受苦人的那种态度（这些村干部过去都是他的长工、佃户），所以村干更害怕他。当时区里正召开各村干部会议，一听说这件事情，都气愤不下，便组织了全区干部向他斗争；县书王庭栋同志、分委曹学德、李玉昌，区长杨清义，也向他提出抗议，坚决给农民撑腰，翟看事情不好，才改变了态度，把好地三十亩挑了以后，才把地交给群众，群众问他要内货、要枪支，他说：“我就没有内货枪支！”结果他把内货都带走了。翟士贤的“献田”就是在这样情况下献的。当人民日报把“献田”新闻发表后，三区干部和伯延周围村干部群众纷纷议论说：“干部还是吃的开，压迫了群众报上还要鼓励。”有些区干部也向记者史洪提出意见，而史洪的答复是：“不要光看这件事，这主要是影响别的地方。”
    以上情况完全是确实的，是三区分委李玉昌同志亲口谈的材料，且经县书王庭栋同志的同意。（张一英）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编辑按：一英同志这一揭露很好，为便利读者对照研究，特将去年八月二日本报二版所载翟士贤献出新闻原文附刊于下：北方大学教员翟士贤同志，说服自己家庭，将自己部分田产、房屋、衣物献与村农会，请求分配给贫苦农民，以加速实行中共及孙中山先生“耕者有其田”的主张。所献财产包括田地二百多亩，房子二百多间，及价值数百万元之衣物用具。翟同志家庭系武安县伯延镇有名三大地主之一，本人系中共党员，日本早稻田大学毕业，曾任八路军太岳纵队宣传科长，现任北方大学教员，他在给中共武安县党委会的信中说：“为实现我党‘耕者有其田’的伟大理想，我愿将自己的田产房屋，献给勤劳的农民，使解放区的每一个农民迅速获得必须的生产条件，加速推进中国社会大踏步前进。”武安县委当即复信表示欢迎，并号召干部首先响应这一运动。伯延镇的农民们，街谈巷议交口赞美说：“他献出田地帮助咱们翻身，真不愧为共产党员。
