　　The Origin of the "Xishan Conference Faction"
　　Comrade Jin Gengcheng asked: What is the Xishan Conference Faction? When was the Xishan Conference held? Who participated? What was discussed?
　　Answer: The Xishan Conference was a counter-revolutionary meeting of the Kuomintang reactionaries. After the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation in 1923-24, the Chinese revolutionary movement ushered in a new situation. First, in Guangzhou, the revolutionary stronghold at the time, the workers' and peasants' movement and the anti-imperialist movement developed rapidly; throughout the country, the broad masses of people launched a movement to convene a national assembly, demanding the convening of a national assembly to formulate a constitution and establish a democratic republic. By the winter of 1925, after the victories of the May 30th Movement, the Canton-Hong Kong strike and the two Eastern Expeditions of the National Revolutionary Army, the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary upsurge in the country was even higher. At that time, the reactionary elements of the Kuomintang, Zou Lu, Ju Zheng, Lin Sen, Shi Qingyang, Qin Zhen, Shen Dingyi, Ye Chucang, Shi Ying, Shao Yuanchong, Zhang Ji, Xie Chi, Mao Zuquan, Zhang Zhiben, Fu Rulin, and Sun Ke, the current "Vice President of the National Government" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, etc., in order to compromise with imperialism and feudal forces, held a meeting on December 23rd in Xishan, Beiping. The content of the meeting was to oppose the Three People's Principles' three major policies of revolution and oppose the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. At that time, counter-revolutionary resolutions were made: 1. Abolish the Political Committee. 2. Expel Communist Party members who joined the Kuomintang; 3. Abolish the positions of Communist Party members as Central Committee members in the Kuomintang. 4. Dismiss the Soviet Russian advisor Borodin from his post.

　　“西山会议派”的来历
    靳根成同志问：什么是西山会议派？西山会议在什么时候举行？有什么人参加？谈的内容是什么？
    答：西山会议是国民党反动派的一个反革命会议。一九二三——二四年国共合作后，中国革命运动开创了一个新局面。首先在当时革命堡垒的广州，工农运动反帝运动一日千里的开展着；在全国，广大民众开展着召集国民会议的运动，到处要求召集国民会议制定宪法，建立民主共和政体。至一九二五年冬天，经过五三运动、省港大罢工及国民革命军两次东征的胜利，全国反帝反封建革命浪潮更形高涨，当时国民党中反动分子邹鲁、居正、林森、石青阳、覃振、沈定一、叶楚伧、石瑛、邵元冲、张继、谢持、茅祖权、张知本、傅汝霖，以及目前蒋匪“国府副主席”孙科等，为谋与帝国主义及封建势力妥协，于十二月二十三日在北平西山召开会议，会议的内容为反对革命的三民主义三大政策，反对国共合作。当时曾作出反革命决议案：一、取消政治委员会。二、开除共产党员加入国民党之者党籍；三、取消共产党员在国民党内之中央委员职务。四、解除苏俄顾问鲍罗廷之职务。
