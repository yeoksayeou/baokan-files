Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 11th: TASS, New York, September 9th: The Council of the "American Progressive Citizens Association" recently passed a statement on foreign policy, vehemently attacking the "Marshall Plan" as a threat to world unity and peace. The statement declared: "The Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine contain the same dangers." It also stated: "The Truman Doctrine is in direct opposition to the United Nations. It forces us to openly ally with fascist or quasi-fascist regimes in the Middle East and Far East, forces us to implement a policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and often stands on the side of reactionary groups in those countries. It favors militaristic and anti-democratic governments in Latin America." It continued: "It is this same policy that promoted the Marshall Plan and made the reconstruction of the Ruhr the primary goal for the recovery of Europe. The needs of the aggressors are placed above the needs of the victims." The declaration pointed out that "this is entirely the view of former President Hoover." It further stated: "The people of Europe are clearly disturbed by the dangers of the Marshall Plan's reconstruction of the Ruhr and the general policy of the United States towards Germany. The Marshall Plan will inevitably be opposed by the people of Eastern Europe as part of the overall policy of the United States, which since the end of the war has regarded former allies as enemies and former enemies as friends." The statement pointed out: The Marshall Plan will inevitably divide Europe into Eastern and Western blocs, and strongly advocated that Eastern Europe should not be excluded from the European economy, because the needs of Eastern and Western Europe are interdependent. The statement declared: The artificial division created by the Marshall Plan will ultimately exacerbate the economic crisis in Western European countries, undermine their stability, strengthen the dollar's dominance over their economies, and condemned American imperialists for frequently interfering in the internal affairs of Britain, France, and Italy, disregarding the historical development of Europe and the economic forms of certain plans favored by the people, and attempting to turn back the clock. The statement suggested that the Ruhr be immediately placed under international co-management, and its industrial potential be utilized by all the people of Europe; and to eliminate the rule of international cartels. The statement also suggested that the United States abolish its tariff barriers and negotiate reciprocal trade agreements with all peace-loving countries. The statement advocated that before the United Nations Reconstruction Fund is raised, American emergency aid to Europe should be without political color. The council also passed a statement on the domestic political situation, stating that American monopoly capital, allied with warlords, has completely controlled the decisive institutions of the American government and gained control over both parties. The statement denounced American monopoly capital's attempt to defeat the growing opposition to its warmongering policy at home; and stated: Democratic forces cannot hope for a Democratic Party revolution under Truman's leadership. The statement emphasized the Progressive Citizens Association's determination to continue to cooperate with all groups that defend peace and democracy.

　　美进步公民协会声明
  　决心保卫和平民主
  　反对杜鲁门外交政策
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社纽约九日讯：“美进步公民协会”理事会，顷通过外交政策声明，猛烈攻击“马歇尔计划”为威胁世界团结与和平。声明宣称：“马歇尔计划与杜鲁门主义包含着相同的危险。”又称：“杜鲁门主义是直接反对联合国的，它强迫我们公开与中东远东的法西斯或准法西斯政权联盟，强迫我们实行干涉他国内政的政策，而且经常是站在那些国家的反动集团方面。它宠爱拉丁美洲军国主义与反民主的政府。”继称：“正是这同一政策，促进了马歇尔计划，并且重建鲁尔成为恢复欧洲的第一个目标。侵略者的需要被置于牺牲者需要之上。”宣言于指出“这完全是前总统胡佛之观点”。复称：“欧洲人民显已为马歇尔重建鲁尔之危险性及美国对德之一般政策所扰乱。马歇尔计划不可避免地将被东欧人民视为美国全部政策之一部分而予以反对。此一政策自战争结束后便视以前之盟邦为敌人，以前之敌人为朋友。”声明指出：马歇尔计划不可避免地要分裂欧洲为东西两集团，并力主：东欧不能被摒斥于欧洲经济之外，因为东西欧之需要是互相倚存的。声明宣称：马歇尔计划所造成的人为分裂，最终将更加剧西欧各国之经济危机，破坏它们的稳定，以致加强美元对它们经济的统治，并谴责美帝国主义分子经常干涉英、法、意之内政，不顾欧洲的历史发展和众人拥护的某些计划的经济的形式，而企图开倒车。声明建议立即由国际共管鲁尔，其工业潜在力由欧洲一切人民利用；并摒除国际卡迪尔的统治。声明又建议美国撤销其关税壁垒，与一切爱好和平国家谈判互惠贸易协定。声明主张在联合国重建基金未筹集之前，美国对欧洲之紧急援助应无分政治色彩。理事会同时通过关于国内政局之声明称：美国独占资本联合军阀，已完全控制了美政府中有决定性之机构，并获得对两党的统治权。声明申斥美独占资本企图击败国内日益增张的对其好战政策之反对；并称：民主力量不能希望在杜鲁门领导下会有民主党的革新。声明强调进步公民协会决心与一切保卫和平与民主之团体继续合作。
