　　Farmers in Five Counties on the Northern Edge of the Yue Mountains Rise Up to Condemn Chiang Kai-shek
  　4,000 Enlist in Ten Days
    Fushan Joyfully Sends Off Over 400 New Soldiers
    [Our Paper, Taiyue, 14th Dispatch] After receiving news of the great counter-offensive, the masses in the five counties of Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huoxian, and Zhaocheng on the northern edge of the Yue Mountains successively launched an upsurge of joining the army starting on the 20th of last month. Preliminary statistics up to the 30th show that 4,350 young and strong men have voluntarily joined the counter-offensive army. Zhaocheng began in mid-September. In the past half month, the liberated farmers throughout the county have unanimously shouted the resounding slogan: "Make great contributions on the counter-offensive front!" The militiamen are generally discussing, "If we don't hurry up and join the army, we'll be too late to kill the Chiang bandit troops!" At a meeting of over 400 village cadres in the Third District on the 17th, cadres such as Guo Chongjing, director of the Armed Forces Committee of Gao'ai Village, Su Bingwen, director of the Armed Forces Committee of Hanjiazhuang, and Li Jincai, deputy of the Funiuzhi Village took the lead in joining the army. Han Cunquan, the village chief of the Jingozi Administrative Village, led sixteen young men to sign up for the army. Sun Jiashan, chairman of the labor union, immediately led seven young men to sign up. Li Yunfa, a 50-year-old man, encouraged his son, saying, "Come back after defeating Chiang Kai-shek!" At the Guan Kou base point, fifty young men signed up at once. Forty-two students from the county's Simple Teachers' School also abandoned their pens for the army. By this point, over 900 young men in the county had signed up. In Pingyao, after the cadre expansion meeting on the 16th, over 120 young men from the Fourth District alone voluntarily signed up. Within ten days, the whole county expanded to over 220 people. In Jiexiu, from September 18th to the 30th, over 240 people signed up. In Lingshi, over 150 young men have signed up for the army, awaiting orders to go to the front. In Huoxian, in addition to the 2,402 young men who signed up at the counter-offensive mobilization meeting on September 7th, the number has expanded to over 2,800 after five days of continuous registration. Currently, Pingyao, Lingshi, and other places are continuing to develop forward.
    [Our Paper, Fushan News] The old district of Fushan (Districts 2, 4, and 5) has successfully completed and exceeded its conscription task. On October 1st, over 3,000 people, including county military and government representatives, family members of new soldiers, etc., joyfully sent off the new soldiers at the county government auditorium. Everyone attending brought gifts, with smiles on their faces, and amid the din of gongs and drums, slogans, and applause, they welcomed 430 new soldiers to enter the venue in formation. After the opening of the conference, County Magistrate Cao and Deputy Political Commissar Xu spoke. The responsible comrades of the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Districts and the mass representatives of each district proposed to the new soldier comrades: "You make great contributions to killing the enemy on the front line, and we will take care of your families in the rear." Comrade Zhang Xingwen, a new soldier, delivered a reply: "We are progressive youths, and we have joined the army. Today, we will take up our guns to deal with Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. The Chiang bandit is the root of all evil, and we must eradicate the root of all evil to live peaceful lives. We will clench our teeth tightly, clench our fists firmly, hold our guns steadily, sharpen our bayonets quickly, aim accurately, and stab the enemy in the heart." Liu Fatang, a new soldier from Fancun in the Second District, raised his voice and said: "Before, we were poor boys and often bullied. The Communist Party came and we turned ourselves over. To protect our fruits of liberation, I want to go to the front line to kill the enemy. If we don't defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we won't be thoroughly liberated." One after another, the new soldiers resolutely expressed their attitudes at the conference. Then, Chen Jie, the military family representative (woman), said: "Joining the army is everyone's business, it is a glorious thing, so I mobilized my husband to join the army. If no one is willing to part with their man, who will fight Chiang Kai-shek!" Finally, all the new soldiers took an oath to resolutely serve the people to the end, and vowed not to give up until Chiang bandits are completely eliminated. Then everyone raised their flags high and paraded to send them off. Shops along the street set up wine and fruit banquets to send them off. Every new soldier had a smiling face.
