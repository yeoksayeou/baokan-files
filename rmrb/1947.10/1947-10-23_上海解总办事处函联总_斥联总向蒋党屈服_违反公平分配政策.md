Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th -- Shanghai News: Lin Zhong, Acting Director of the Shanghai Office of the Relief Headquarters, issued a letter on the 14th to UNRRA Director Rooks and UNRRA China Office Director Cleveland, pointing out that since July, UNRRA's policy has completely succumbed to the Kuomintang's "General Mobilization Order," abandoning its position as a neutral international relief organization and violating the policy of fair distribution of relief supplies without discrimination. The letter stated that the Liberated Areas have not received any relief supplies since July 3rd. In early July, Rooks sent a letter to Relief Headquarters, guaranteeing that UNRRA's policy "remains unchanged," but the reality is completely the opposite. The letter emphasized that if UNRRA implements the following three measures, it may salvage its reputation as an international relief organization: First, immediately release the "Wan Dian" relief ship carrying Yellow River relief supplies and medicines donated voluntarily by all parties, as well as the 55 barges detained in Tianjin at the end of July; Second, immediately resume shipping to the Liberated Areas, using at a minimum the canals in the Bohai and Hebei areas, as well as airplanes, to transport the already allocated 50,000 tons of relief supplies to the Liberated Areas; Third, immediately pay the outstanding amount of the second phase of the Yellow River returning-to-its-old-course embankment project, as well as food rations, and immediately provide relief to the victims of the Yellow River area caused by the Kuomintang's breaching of the dikes. (Note: Since this spring, Chiang Kai-shek's planes and Chiang Kai-shek's troops have been continuously bombing and breaching the dikes that are being built within the Liberated Areas of Jilu-Yu and Shandong; in early August alone, during the period when Chiang's planes bombed the dikes, more than 140 villages and towns were flooded within the three counties of Yuncheng, Qiucheng, and Shouzhang in Jilu-Yu.)

　　上海解总办事处函联总
  　斥联总向蒋党屈服
  　违反公平分配政策
    【新华社陕北二十日电】上海消息：解总上海办事处代理处长林仲于十四日发表致联总署长鲁克斯与联总中国分署署长克利夫兰的函件，指出自七月以来，联总之政策已在国民党“总动员令”下完全屈服，放弃了做为一个中立的国际救济机关的地位，违反了不歧视的公平分配救济物资的政策。信中说明解放区自七月三日以来，即未收到救济物资。七月初鲁克斯曾致函解联，保证联总政策“仍然不变”，但事实则完全相反。该函强调指出：如联总履行下述三项办法，即可能挽救其做为国际救济机关的名誉：第一、立即释放载有各方自愿捐助的黄河救济品与药品的“万甸”（译音）号救济船及七月底被扣于天津的五十五艘驳船；第二、立即恢复解放区船运，最低限度应用渤海与河北区之运河以及飞机，将早已分配定的五万吨救济物资运至解放区；第三、立即交付黄河归故筑堤第二期工款、工粮欠额，并立即救济因国民党决堤所造成之黄河区灾民。（按自今春以来，蒋介石飞机及蒋介石军队对我冀鲁豫及山东解放区境内正建筑之堤岸所实行之炸堤决堤行为，从未间断；仅八月初旬蒋机炸堤期间，冀鲁豫郓城、邱城、寿张三县境内被淹没者即达一百四十余村镇。）
