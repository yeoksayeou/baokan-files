　　Single County Cadres and Masses Closely United
  　Insisting on Guerrilla Warfare in the Hinterland
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Jilu豫 (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) on the 17th] In Single County, in the midst of persisting in guerrilla warfare, cadres and the masses are closely united, ensuring that the county does not leave the county, the districts do not leave the districts, and the villages do not leave the villages, establishing a model for persisting in the struggle in the hinterland. Since August 25th, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, with the New Fifth Division and Wu Pin-san's other stubborn troops and bandits, numbering over 20,000, have invaded the county, and all eleven districts including Cao Ma and Anlin have been occupied. A portion of our cadres insisted on staying put, while another portion mobilized and transferred with small armed units, combining with comrades who insisted on staying put to carry out work at any time. Cadres who insisted on staying put dispersed in groups of three or five, relying on and leading the masses to struggle against the enemy. In An'de District, a landlord in a certain village reported public grain to the enemy and forced the masses to provide resources to the enemy. We immediately arrested him, publicly tried him in front of the masses, and executed him by shooting. Whenever there was information about the enemy, the cadres immediately led the masses to hide together. The women's sisters groups each carried twenty or thirty jin of public grain and public flour with them to hide, in order to maintain the supply to the troops at any time. The elderly and children organized reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. As soon as the enemy's large units left, they immediately returned to the village to carry out propaganda and mobilization, raising the morale of the masses. In such a tense environment, the county's re-examination and war support work were still carried out in combination as usual. Male and female cadres in each village were divided into four groups, the men leading stretchers, and the women re-examining at home. When the stretchers in Cao Ma District set out with the army, young women and sisters groups lined up to see them off. The stretchers in the district all completed their tasks, and none deserted. After the men in Fang Gui District left to support the front, the women supported the East China Field Army at home, completing the troop's grain supply. Because of the cadres' persistence in sharing life and death with the masses, the masses showed a high degree of fighting spirit. In a certain village in Cao Ma District, two members of the children's corps were captured by the enemy, beaten twice to the point of being half-dead, but never revealed the whereabouts of the cadres. The chairwoman of a certain village women's association was beaten by the enemy until her skin was broken and her flesh was torn. Finally, she was buried halfway and interrogated about public grain and public property, but she did not say a word until her death. In terms of nursing and sheltering the wounded, the masses showed an even higher degree of class friendship. The county once hid 400 wounded soldiers under very tense enemy conditions. The enemy searched the village several times, but the masses all sheltered the wounded as their own husbands and sons, carrying the seriously wounded to the fields to hide in makeshift shelters. After old lady Hu from a certain village hid the wounded in the fields, the enemy had already entered the village, but she still carried the white flour she had been hiding for two months on her back, secretly delivering fried cakes to the wounded, who were moved to tears. Because the masses nursed and hid the wounded in this way, only eleven out of four hundred wounded were killed by the enemy.

　　单县干群密切结合
  　坚持腹地游击战争
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】单县坚持游击战中，干部与群众密切结合，做到县不离县区不离区村不离村，树立坚持腹地斗争模范。自八月二十五日起，蒋匪以新五师与吴品三等顽杂两万余人向该县进犯，曹马、安临等十一个区均全被占领，我干部一部分则就地坚持，一部分带小武装机动转移，随时与就地坚持的同志结合进行工作。就地坚持的干部三、五分散依靠并领导群众对敌斗争。安德区某村地主向敌人报告公粮，强迫群众资敌，我马上将其逮捕，在群众面前公审枪决。一有敌情，干部即带领群众一同隐蔽，妇女姊妹团并每人随身携带公粮公面二三十斤，跟随隐蔽，以随时保持对部队的供给。老年与儿童组织侦察情报，敌人大队一走，他们马上插回村进行宣传鼓动，提高群众情绪。在如此紧张环境下，该县复查与战勤工作仍然照常结合进行，各村男女干部分成四套，男的带领担架，女的在家复查。曹马区担架随军出发时，青年妇女与姊妹团列队欢送，该区担架均完成任务，未有一付逃亡。芳桂区男子支前走后，女的在家支应华东野战军，完成部队的粮食供给。由于干部与群众同生共死的坚持，群众均表现高度的斗争勇气，曹马区某村两个儿童团员被敌人抓去，吊打两次死去活来，始终未说出干部所在，某庄妇会长被敌人打得皮破肉烂，最后埋了半截，拷问其公粮公物，她至死不说。在养护与掩护伤员上，群众更表现了高度的阶级友爱，该县曾在敌情十分紧张的情况下，隐蔽伤员四百人，敌人数次进村搜查，群众均掩护伤员为自己丈夫、儿子，重伤员或抬到地里隐蔽搭窝铺。某村胡老太太把伤员隐蔽在地里后，敌人已进了村，但他仍背着敌人，把自己藏了两个月的白面，做成油饼给伤员送去，伤员感动得洒泪。由于群众如此养护隐蔽伤员，四百彩号中仅有十一人被敌人杀害。
