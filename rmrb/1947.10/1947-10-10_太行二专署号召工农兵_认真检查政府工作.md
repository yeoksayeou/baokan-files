　　Taihang Second District Commissioner's Office Calls on Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
  　Conscientiously Inspect Government Work
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to welcome the large-scale re-examination after the autumn harvest and completely eliminate feudalism, the Taihang Second District Commissioner's Office, in conjunction with the Three Check-ups Movement, has specifically called on all workers, peasants, and soldiers in the district to comprehensively inspect the work of the government. The call states: Since August, the Three Check-ups Movement conducted by the commissioner's office, county, and district-level government organs, and all cadres and miscellaneous personnel in the organs, regardless of their class background, have revealed, after preliminary inspection, many areas in terms of their stance and work style that do not meet the demands and interests of the masses; however, inspecting only within government organs cannot uncover all policies and personnel that do not meet the demands and interests of the masses. Therefore, in order to thoroughly improve government work, wholeheartedly serve the people, welcome the large-scale re-examination after the autumn harvest, and support the front lines in organizing famine relief, we specifically call on all workers, peasants, and soldiers in the district to inspect the work of governments at all levels and all personnel. It then raises the following questions: In the areas of land reform, supporting the war, production for famine relief, and supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, what matters urgently need to be addressed? What matters have not been handled well? What matters do not meet the demands of the masses and should not be handled? Especially in land reform, where has the government not provided enough support? Which individuals hold the stance of landlords? Which individuals exhibit bureaucracy? Which individuals do not respect the interests of the masses or harm the interests of the masses? ... We earnestly hope that discussions will be launched in factories, rural areas, military units, and schools, and that everyone will speak freely and fully about what they have seen, heard, and felt, and provide us with oral or written reports, exposing the areas in the government's stance and work style that do not meet the demands and interests of the masses, in order to improve and enhance government work. Finally, it emphasizes: Government personnel are the servants of the masses, the long-term laborers of the masses. Our requirement is how to better serve the masses in the future and be a good long-term laborer. We hope that all workers, peasants, and soldiers in the district will strictly criticize and inspect the work of the government. (Pi Yu)
