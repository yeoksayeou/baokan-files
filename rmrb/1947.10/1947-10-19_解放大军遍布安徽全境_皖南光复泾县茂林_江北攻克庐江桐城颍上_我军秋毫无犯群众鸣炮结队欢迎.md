Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan, 17th: People's armed forces in southern Anhui are active, successively capturing towns such as Jingxian and Maolin. According to the Chiang bandit's Wuhan Daily of September 30, after the "loss" of Jingxian and Maolin, the situation in southern Anhui has become increasingly tense, and the river defense forces (referring to Chiang bandit troops) in the Huangshan area are strengthening their defenses in an attempt to prevent the counter-attacking army active in northern Anhui from crossing the river and joining forces in southern Anhui.

Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Frontline, 17th: After annihilating the Chiang bandit army's 88th Division, 62nd Brigade, and liberating Shucheng, a certain unit of the Western Anhui Liberation Army then liberated Lujiang County for the second time on the 14th. The defending enemy fled in panic; the Liberation Army was well-disciplined and committed no offenses. More than ten thousand merchants and residents gathered in festive processions, setting off firecrackers to welcome the Liberation Army into the city. On the same day, another unit of the Liberation Army liberated Tongcheng County for the second time, annihilating a part of the enemy's Youth Army, capturing more than fifty enemy soldiers, and seizing four machine guns and more than thirty rifles.
