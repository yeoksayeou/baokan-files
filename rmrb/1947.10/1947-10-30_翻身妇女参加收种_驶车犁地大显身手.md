Liberated Women Participate in Harvesting and Planting
	Driving Vehicles and Plowing Fields, Showing Great Skill

[This newspaper, Jiluyu, reported on the 28th:] Since the task of autumn harvest and wheat planting was proposed, liberated women have shown great skill, able to harvest, drive vehicles, and plow fields. In Gezhai, First District, eleven young women, led by team leader Yang Xiulian, pulled plows and harrows, planting nine mu of wheat in three days. They set up a challenge match at a mass meeting, stimulating the production enthusiasm of the whole village. Li, the wife of Liu Genzhi in Linzhai, led her entire team in harvesting, completing the harvest task in two days, and was selected as a model team. In Malou, Third District, Wang Xiu'e and Lan Xiuying plowed two and a half mu of land in half a day, plowing deeply and straight. Mu Yuping of ×Panzhuang alone did all the work for her family's nineteen mu of land, driving vehicles, hauling manure, plowing, and harrowing, doing everything, and leading all the women in the village. In Zhangzhai, Fourth District, the young women's team, totaling twenty-five people, did not lag behind the men's teams in any kind of work and challenged the men to a competition. In Renlou, Sixth District, Gao Xiuying and the wife of Ren Ronggui, after their husbands left home, not only did not ask for help in fetching water and harvesting, but also helped others with harvesting. In Maxinji, Seventh District, team leader Pan Qing led three people in her team, harvesting seventy-three mu of autumn crops in four days, and also pushing sixty to seventy loads of manure every night.

[Another dispatch] In "Sihe Village," First District of Puyang County, the model female team leader Zhang Furong is also a "poverty commander" (a term for leading figures among poor peasants). These two women helped poor military families plant wheat, plowing four and a half mu for Zhang Chongqin's family and helping with sowing five mu for Zhang Ji's family in half a day. This influenced all departments, and they all said, "Look how energetic the women are, we have to work harder!" Now all departments have taken up the competition.

[This newspaper, Licheng News] In this year's autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign, after studying current affairs beforehand and realizing that our army's task of crossing the river and digging out the old roots (referring to the enemy) was more demanding, mutual aid organizations were generally reorganized, with poor peasants and farm laborers as the backbone. Accurate calculations were made, and it was recognized that there was a shortage of labor, that the flooded land was difficult to access, that the season did not allow further delay, and that there was concern that the land would be too wet and the frozen clods would not break in the morning, resulting in poor seedling establishment next spring if it did not rain. Therefore, the whole county universally organized auxiliary labor. According to statistics from forty-two villages including Hujia Yao, Xiwu, and Changning, 4,343 women, 1,422 children, and 723 elderly men went to the fields to harvest, reaping 31,287 mu of grain, 2,030 mu of soybeans, 882 mu of buckwheat, 600 mu of millet, and stripping 10,432 mu of corn cobs in two to seven days. Women did all the corn cob cutting. In many villages, women carried grain and pulled threshing rollers, freeing up men to plow the land and plant wheat. With the help of men, techniques have also been improved. For example, in the beginning in the city, men complained that the women were cutting the stubble too high and dropping grain, and the women said, "We are putting in effort but not getting credit." Later, both sides studied the issue, and each team had men to guide the techniques. Therefore, ten teams of 110 people were organized, completely led by poor peasant women, harvesting 498 mu of grain, 146 mu of buckwheat, 95 mu of soybeans, and stripping 176 mu of corn cobs in three days, and implementing daily wage payment. Those who wanted money could get it that day, those who wanted grain could settle accounts later, and those who wanted to exchange labor could do so, entirely according to the women's own decisions. The Zheng Society (agricultural cooperative) organized contract work for harvesting, contracting by the mu, and democratically rewarding those who cut the stubble low and neatly. Each team selected one or two men to guide the techniques and help with scoring and accounting. Dongbei Cao Zhaodi's and Chang Mai'e's team of ten people created a method for women to divide work and profits. Chang Mai'e took five young people to the fields to harvest, while Wen Shuzhen and three other strong women cut corn cobs and prepared meals, and Wang Ou'er and three old women looked after children and did odd jobs. After the division of labor, they harvested twenty-four mu of grain in three days, cutting all the cobs. Wang Shuiping's child was looked after by Wang Ou'er, implementing a 3-7 profit split, Shuiping getting seven and Ou'er three. Mai'e gave Wang Qin corn cutting wages and prepared meals with a 3-7 profit split, Mai'e getting seven and the mother-in-law three. In Xiwu, the base point was a 4-6 split for women with children and their mothers-in-law, the mother-in-law getting four and the daughter-in-law six, and a 3-7 split for those without children, the mother-in-law getting three and the daughter-in-law seven. In Lizhuang, Li Bao, and other villages, women not only harvested but also carried grain and pulled threshing rollers. Li Bao Li Xiaolan's team of seven people threshed twenty-four mu of grain, four mu of millet, and one mu of soybeans in two days, proposing to grind and winnow themselves without the help of men, and then carry it home, freeing up men for autumn harvesting and wheat planting.
