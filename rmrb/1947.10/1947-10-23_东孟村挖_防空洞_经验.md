Dongmeng Village's Experience in Digging "Air Raid Shelters"
    Song Zhuqin

    From Dongmeng Village's perspective, the landlords' methods of dispersing wealth were as follows: silver dollars, silver ingots, pearls, and gold and silver utensils were buried underground; grains, cloth, farm tools, porcelain, and other items that were inconvenient to bury underground were hidden in "air raid shelters" by utilizing various relationships and methods.

    "Air raid shelters" were a mass phenomenon: Dongmeng Village had 120 households, of which 12 were targeted for struggle, 13 were purged by the Farmers' Association, and one was a minor too young to participate. The Farmers' Association had 94 members, and 54 households had "air raid shelters" (two were not members of the Farmers' Association), accounting for 55.3% of the Farmers' Association members. (Note: According to the district's work reports, this generally accounted for half of all households. A county and district training session for 4,959 village cadres and poor and hired peasants revealed that 1,305 people confessed to having "air raid shelters," accounting for slightly more than a quarter. From a class perspective, all five wealthy middle peasants had "air raid shelters," 15 out of 30 middle peasants had them, and 33 out of 69 poor and hired peasants had them. There was also one bankrupt landlord.)

    The relationship between "air raid shelters" and landlords can be roughly divided into six categories: (1) Relatives: accounting for 13 households out of 54. These were the landlords' most reliable "air raid shelters," hiding good and large quantities of items, mostly good grain and clothing. For example, Ge Langzi hid 28 bags of wheat belonging to his landlord brother-in-law. Liu Laoyu hid things for five landlord families, including his brother-in-law, son-in-law, uncle-in-law, and two distant relatives. Liu Jinhe stored seven bags of grain and two bundles for the landlord Dong Lao Xin, also a distant relative. (2) Housekeepers and trusted figures: i.e., those who had been housekeepers, shopkeepers, second creditors, or accountants for the landlords, accounting for two households. Although the number of households was small, they were also the landlords' trusted "air raid shelters," hiding large quantities of things. For example, Dong Xulu had been a housekeeper for the landlord Niu Lao De for over ten years and hid a large quantity of things for him. The above two types were the main targets for "air raid shelters." (3) Landlord employees: hired laborers, tenants, cooks, wet nurses, and those who frequently worked short-term jobs, accounting for five households. (4) Relatives living in the same courtyard, accounting for six households. These two types were secondary, generally hiding one or two quilts and a few pieces of used clothing. (5) Neighbors, accounting for 11 households. (6) General acquaintances, accounting for 17 households. These two types had a large number of households, but the things hidden were scattered and not much or of good quality, such as a table or a harrow and other farm tools. The form of expression was often borrowing, but they were not returned for a long time. In the struggle, they neither automatically gave them to the Farmers' Association, nor did they pity the landlords and return them after the struggle. In reality, this was a method for landlords to disperse their assets. In addition, village cadres, militiamen, and dependents of soldiers who were fooled and bought off by landlords acted as insurance "air raid shelters." Six village cadres (instructor, village head, Farmers' Association director, two committee members, and women's association director) from five households were "air raid shelters." Only the Farmers' Association director was a single man with no family; six out of ten Farmers' Association group leaders were, and six out of twelve militiamen were, and three out of eight dependents of soldiers were. Some village cadres hid things in large quantities. For example, Farmers' Association committee member Dong Lao Meng stored seven bundles and seven bags of grain for the landlord. Liang Lao Yu, the instructor of Zhongmeng Village in the neighboring village, stored six bags of wheat, a waterwheel, and fifteen bundles for the landlord Liu Lao Zhen in this village. Landlords considered these to be insurance shelters and mostly used bribery. For example, Liang Lao Yu wanted the landlord's waterwheel, nominally buying it, but in reality, the landlord offered it as a gift. Liu Lao Wang, a dependent of a soldier, stored things for five landlord families, relying on the fact that he was a dependent of a soldier and no one would bother him.

    The experience of Dongmeng Village illustrates the following issues: (1) Digging "air raid shelters" was a conscious movement of the masses, and it cannot be completely resolved by punishing one or two households. The attitude towards "air raid shelters" should not be resolved through struggle, but rather through a difficult ideological mobilization process. It should be achieved through conscious application of thought, encouraging the masses to voluntarily report and mutually denounce. (2) Whether "air raid shelters" can be completely dug out marks whether the landlords have been thoroughly struggled against. Only when the masses see that the landlords are truly about to collapse or that the trend is irreversible will they hand over the things hidden for the landlords. Dongmeng Village had completely arrested the landlords, and the masses generally recognized that this time the landlords would be thoroughly struggled against, and only then did the movement to dig "air raid shelters" begin. Conversely, in the neighboring village of ×× Village, the degree of mass mobilization did not yet show that the landlords were about to completely collapse, and the digging of "air raid shelters" could not be thoroughly carried out. (3) "Air raid shelters" cannot be completely dug out in a single instance, but rather repeatedly cleared out as the masses' awareness increases and the landlords finally and completely collapse. Dongmeng Village underwent more than a week of "air raid shelter" digging movement, with cadres consciously reporting first, group mobilization and denunciation, and repeated voluntary submissions in mass meetings several times, before a portion was dug out. According to the masses' estimates, this was still only about two-thirds of the total, and there was still a considerable distance from being thorough. One old woman, Ge Ji Jie, stored things for three landlord families and made a total of seven submissions before clearing everything out.

    Those who acted as "air raid shelters" had several concerns: If they didn't submit, they were afraid that the masses would struggle against them and that the landlords would expose them first, which would be a big mistake. If they submitted, they were afraid that the masses would punish them and expel them from the Farmers' Association; they were also afraid of letting down the landlords, fearing that if the landlords were not overthrown, they would resent them and seek revenge, and they were also afraid of losing face. For example, Liu Sha, a militiaman who acted as an "air raid shelter," said to the landlord, "You can't expose me even if you're beaten to death. I can't say that I'm storing things for you." Ge Lao Qi said, "What if the landlords fail after I submit?" The thinking of relatives who were "air raid shelters" was the most stubborn. Liu Lao Yu stored things for his daughter and was mobilized dozens of times, but only took out his own rotten things to temporarily cover up. Cadres were particularly afraid of losing face. Most "air raid shelters" would say when taking things out, "Look! I didn't know the landlords just put them in my haystack." Or say, "I wasn't home, and my woman was confused and hid them." Or say, "I borrowed them." They pushed the responsibility away to give themselves some room to dodge. Ge Ji Jie couldn't eat for seven or eight days when she heard about the struggle and the digging of "air raid shelters." She was restless, walking from the house to the yard, and from the yard to the street, bearing a huge ideological burden.

    The specific methods used in Dongmeng Village were: (1) Dig from the inside out, with cadres digging first, then the masses. Village cadres and poor peasants had already voluntarily reported in the conscious movement in the county and district training classes. After returning, they immediately convened a mass meeting, where the cadres openly dug out their own things first, calling on the masses to voluntarily report. The cadres then went to the groups and households (especially those with connections) to mobilize, combining voluntary submission with honor, solidarity of the poor, and separation from the landlords, to resolve ideological concerns and promote voluntary submission by the masses. In this way, the masses saw that the cadres were also submitting, and they dared to submit themselves. (2) Dig the small holes first, then dig the big holes. At the beginning, the small holes (employees, neighbors, general acquaintances) voluntarily reported one after another. The big holes (relatives and lackeys) had intense ideological struggles and were extremely distressed, unwilling to report first. After the problems of most of the masses were resolved and the ideological burden was lifted, they concentrated their efforts on digging the big holes. The best method was to hold repeated mobilization, with cadres and Farmers' Association members going in groups to persuade them until they were broken through. (3) No ventilation on both ends, mutual deception: that is, arrest the landlords and prevent them from communicating with the "air raid shelters." The "air raid shelters" were most afraid that the landlords would expose them first, and the landlords were also afraid that the "air raid shelters" would tell on them first. With no ventilation on both ends, they mutually deceived each other. Regardless of which side exposed first, they would immediately go to retrieve the things and publicize it greatly on the other side, and criticize them to influence others. This was quite effective. (4) Do not establish a covenant in advance. Dongmeng Village felt that it was almost done after the first three or four days and established a covenant, and everyone put their fingerprints on it. But they soon discovered that it was far from thorough, and when they continued to dig, the covenant became a constraint. The masses who were "air raid shelters" said, "The covenant has already been established, so we dare not submit anymore." The movement only started again after the covenant was lifted.

    Mutual communication and consistent steps between villages, districts, and counties is also an important issue for whether "air raid shelters" can be thoroughly dug out. If the district first determines that the materials belong to which village, and no one is allowed to take things out of the village, then the village that knows about the things will not want to notify the outside village, making it easier to preserve the things scattered in outside villages, outside districts, and outside counties. Later, the district determined that whoever brings it out gets it, and if the landlord from the outside village stored it in this village, it belongs to this village. If the landlord from this village stored it in the outside village, this village will first bring it out and escort the landlord to retrieve it. Dongmeng Village went to the outside village to investigate and recover some things. However, the problem of unified steps between districts, especially between counties, has not yet been resolved.

　　东孟村挖“防空洞”经验
    宋祝勤
    从东孟村看，地主疏散财物的办法：银元、元宝、珍珠、金银器皿埋在地下，粮食、衣布、农具、瓷器等品，往地下埋不便者，利用各种关系，各种手腕，藏在“防空洞”里。
    “防空洞”是群众性的：东孟村一百二十户，十二户是被斗争的，十三户是被农会清洗的，一户是不及龄的小孩，农会员共九十四户，搞出“防空洞”共五十四户（两户不在农会），占农会员的百分之五五．三（按：据区里工作汇报一般均占全户数一半，县区集训村干贫雇四千九百五十九人，自报“防空洞”一千三百零五人，占四分之一强。从阶层看：富中农五户都当“防空洞”，中农三十户有十五户，贫雇六十九户有三十三户，另有一家是破落地主。
    “防空洞”与地主的关系约分为六类：（一）亲戚：在五十四户中占十三户，这是地主最可靠的“防空洞”，藏的东西好且是大批，多是粮食好衣服。如葛郎子光藏他地主姐夫麦子二十八布袋。刘老玉藏五家地主东西，包括他姐夫女婿、姨夫，还有两家拐弯亲戚。刘金河存地主董老新谷子七袋，包袱两个，也是拐弯亲戚。（二）管家走里分子：即给地主当过管家的、掌柜、二债主、管帐的等占两户，家数不多，但也是地主的心腹“防空洞”，大批藏东西。如董修路给地主牛老德当管家十来年，大批给牛老德藏东西。以上两种是“防空洞”的主要对象。（三）地主雇佣：雇工、佃户、厨夫、奶妈、经常打短工者占五户。（四）本家当院的占六户。这两种是次要的，一般是藏一二条被子，几件半旧衣服。（五）邻居占十一户。（六）一般关系占十七户。这两种户数多，但藏东西零星，不多不好，如一张桌子一个耙等农具之类，表现形式上多是借的，但长期不还，在斗争中既不自动给农会，斗争后又怜悯地主还地主，实际是地主疏散资财的一种办法。另外村干民兵抗属，上地主当，被收买，当保险“防空洞”，六个村干（指导员、村长、农会主任、常委二、妇会主任）五户是“防空洞”，只有农会主任是个没家的光棍；十个农会组长有六家，十二个民兵有六家，八家抗属有三家，个别村干是大批的藏，如农会常委董老孟存地主包袱七个，粮食七布袋。邻村中孟村指导员梁老鱼存本村地主刘老珍麦子六布袋，水车一架，包袱十五个。地主认为这是保险洞，多是收买方式，如梁老鱼要地主水车，名义是买的，实际是地主奉送。抗属刘老王存五家地主东西，即自恃是抗属保险，不会有人找我事。
    东孟村经验说明如下几个问题：（一）挖“防空洞”是群众的自觉运动，非处分一二户就能够彻底解决的，对待，“防空洞”不能以斗争的态度来解决是个艰苦的思想发动过程，应是运用思想自觉，使群众自觉自报，互相检举动员。（二）“防空洞”能否挖彻底，标志着地主是否斗彻底，当“防空洞”的群众非看到地主真要垮台或大势已去实要垮台，他才将隐藏地主的东西献出来。东孟村是已将地主完全扣起，群众已公认这一次是要把地主斗彻底的，挖“防空洞”运动才开展起来；相反，邻村××庄，群众发动程度还看不到地主就要彻底垮台，挖“防空洞”也就不能彻底开展起来。（三）“防空洞”非简单一次就能挖彻底的，是随着群众觉悟及地主到最后彻底垮台而反复挖清。东孟村是经过一星期以上时间的挖“防空洞”运动，经过干部自觉先报，小组动员检举，大会自献反复数次，才挖出一部，据群众估计仍不过总数的三分之二，离彻底还有相当距离。有一个太婆葛吉姐家存三家地主东西，先后共献七次才献清。
    当“防空洞”者思想有几种顾虑：不献吧，怕群众斗自己，又怕地主先咬出自己错就大了。献了吧，怕群众处分，开除农会；又怕对不起地主，斗不垮地主受地主瞒怨找后帐，还怕丢人。如当“防空洞”的民兵刘沙的给地主说：“打死你也不能咬我，存你东西我可以不说。”葛老齐说：“我献了，斗争后地主不行怎么办？”亲戚“防空洞”思想最顽强，刘老玉存他闺女东西，动员十数次，只不过拿自己的烂东西先充挡一阵。干部特别怕丢人，大多数“防空洞”往外拿东西时都是说：“看！我就不知道地主就给放到我草堆里。”或说：“我没在家娘们糊涂就藏下了。”或说“我是借的。”把责任推开，给自己脸上有躲闪处。葛吉姐一听说闹斗争，并且要搞“防空洞”，七八天吃不下饭，坐卧不安，屋里走到院里，院里走到街里，思想负担极大。
    东孟村具体进行办法是：（一）从里向外挖，干部先挖，再及群众。村干雇贫在县区训练班里自觉运动中已经自献，回来后即召开群众大会，干部公开先挖了自己，号召群众自报，干部再分头到小组到各户（特别有关系户）去动员，结合自献光荣、穷人团结、与地主分家，解决思想顾虑，推动群众自献，这样群众看到干部还献哩，自己也就敢献了。（二）小洞挖了再挖大洞，开始时，小洞（雇佣邻居一般关系）就纷纷自报，大洞（亲戚狗腿）思想斗争急烈，苦恼极大，不舍得先报，等大部群众问题解决，思想负担解除，就集中力量挖大洞，最好方式是举行轮番动员，干部农会分组轮番去劝，直到攻破。（三）两头不透气，互相诈：即扣起地主，不让地主与“防空洞”透气，“防空洞”最怕地主先咬自己，地主也怕“防空洞”先说自己，两头不透气，互相诈，不管某一方先咬，马上就去追出东西，在另一方大加宣传，并予责备，再影响别人，效力颇大。（四）不要提前立公约。东孟村在最初进行了三四天，就觉得已差不多，立了公约，大家都盖了手印，但随即发现离彻底还远，再继续挖时，公约反成了束缚，当“防空洞”的群众说：“公约已立了可不敢再献。”又经解除公约，运动才又开展起来。
    村与村、区与区、县与县的互相打通，步调一致，也是“防空洞”是否能挖彻底一个重要问题。如果先经区确定，物资在那村属那村，不得出村搞东西，这样本村知道的东西就不愿通知外村，就使疏散在外村外区外县的东西容易保留下来，后来经区里又确定谁搞出归谁，外村地主存本村的归本村，本村地主存外村的，本村先搞出来就押带地主取回来。东孟村又到外村查回一部东西。但区与区，特别县与县之间的统一步调问题还没解决。
