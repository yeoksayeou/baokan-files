　　Li Shengzhuang Textile Small Factory
  　How it was Established
    Zhu Bo
    Li Shengzhuang's production mutual aid is a relatively well-established village in Qiu County. One hundred percent of the village participated in mutual aid, but women's textile work had not yet been organized.
    This spring, the village proposed to organize textile mutual aid groups, and the women all started to clamor and argue. Li Wangshi said, "Even if you drive me out of Li Shengzhuang, I will not join the textile factory." Village cadre Li Zhiwen said to Xiao Gai Niang, "Sister-in-law, why don't you take the lead in joining the textile group?" Tenth Sister-in-law said, "I'm not joining any mutual aid!" Zhiwen said again, "If you're told to join, you join. Why are you saying you won't?" Xiao Gai Niang said, "If you say mutual aid, we do mutual aid. If you say jump into a well, do we jump into a well?" Li Zhiwen was stumped and said nothing more. The leadership, seeing that the masses' thinking had not yet been cleared, decided to first hold a mobilization meeting, explain things clearly, and then mobilize for organization.
    At the first women's meeting, the chairman explained the benefits of textile mutual aid, and when he said "Participation in textile work is voluntary, and there is absolutely no coercion," most of the women left, saying as they left, "As long as it's not forced, I won't participate." Some more active women stayed behind and discussed the matter, deciding to first participate themselves, and then go down and find their own targets (women they had a good relationship with) to conduct individual mobilization. Active member Zhao An Niang said to Dong Lin Niang when mobilizing her: "Your Dong Lin is nineteen years old, and hasn't even worn a new piece of clothing. If you participate in textile work, I guarantee you'll wear new clothes." Dong Lin Niang said, "Participating is fine, but I don't have any capital!" Zhao An Niang immediately said, "That's nothing, I'll lend it to you." Old Guo Niang pointed out that they couldn't spin together, "There's no one at my house, and the children's father is also working." Zhao An Niang said, "Alright, even if we set up a small factory, it doesn't necessarily mean we have to work in a pile. Each group can find its own place, and your group can go to the front of your house." When mobilizing Cheng Fu Niang, she said: "I can't even take care of the several people in my family, how can I join a group to weave cloth to sell?!" Zhao An Niang explained to her: "First weave cloth for yourselves to wear, and then weave cloth to sell later." Third Sister-in-law then said, "I take care of the children during the day, feed the cows, and cook. I can't even take care of myself!" The active member said to her, "If you can't spin for a long time, spin for a short time. If you can't spin during the day, spin at night. If the child is fussy, spin after the child falls asleep. If you can't spin much, spin a little." Third Sister-in-law listened and said, "Okay, I'll give it a try." Many young women, wanting to join the textile group, were afraid of being too casual, and that they wouldn't be able to stay with their mothers' families in the future. They were explained to: "Those who spin more, earn more money. Those who spin less, earn less money. Whether you stay with your mother's family or not is up to you. Even if you only participate for two days, if you say you don't want to participate, we'll let you withdraw." After this individual mobilization and linking up, most of the women participated with a "let's give it a try" mentality. Four or five groups were organized, with Zhao Lin Niang publicly elected as the factory director, and Zhang Jinxiu and three others as committee members, and two men, Li Yutang and Li Zhiling, were hired as committee members, responsible for calculating work points, selling finished products, and buying raw materials.
    When textile work started, the first difficulty encountered was a lack of capital and tools. The village cooperative was responsible for lending fifty catties of cotton, and the women themselves also contributed some, and part of the wages from weaving military cloth were also put in. Weaving machines and spinning wheels were allocated appropriately by the group. Other parts such as shuttles would temporarily be bought new with loans from the cooperative, to be resolved from future dividends.
    Just as work had begun, Fang Chen Niang said to the group leader Zhao An Niang: "My child is getting married soon, and I have to prepare. I can't spin now!" Shu Qi Niang, because Shu Qi was wounded at the front, went to the hospital every day, and also asked the group leader for leave. Zhao An Niang readily granted it. Of the five people in the whole group, three took leave, and two couldn't weave cloth. Zhao An Niang and Xiao Yi Niang's group and Yun Ju Niang's group discussed temporarily combining the three groups into one large group.
    After spinning for not long, they successively raised issues such as "What if there are too many stoppages? What if the work is done quickly or slowly? How will the money from sales be distributed?" and other questions. The leadership, seeing that many of the masses were reflecting this way, combined with the experience of agricultural mutual aid, recognized that this was a major matter, and mobilized each group to discuss their own methods for evaluating work and distributing dividends. When Xiao Gai Niang's group was discussing, Xiao Gai Niang said to the group members: "Can't we do things like the mutual aid team?" Then, she said, "If we evaluate work well, it will be easy to handle who does more or less, faster or slower, and it will be resolved." Everyone said, "Okay, okay, let's do it this way." Immediately after, someone raised: "The work we do is different from the work in the mutual aid team. How can evaluating work be like learning from them?" Xiao Gai Niang explained again: "We learn their methods, but still calculate according to the work we do." At this time, several active members said, "One zhang of cloth woven counts as one work point." Everyone then said, "Okay!" "Netting one catty and twelve ounces of thread counts as one work point," "Twisting four catties of cotton counts as one work point," "Okay, okay!" The group members also followed suit. When it was proposed that "Spinning seven ounces of thread counts as one work point," Fu Shen Niang interrupted and said, "Spinning seven ounces of thread for one work point isn't worth it, it's not fair." It was changed to spinning five ounces of thread for one work point. And it was decided that the amount of dividends earned would be averaged per work point, with those who worked more getting more and those who worked less getting less. Finally, the group leader said, "Let's do it this way according to the regulations first. If anyone says this doesn't work later, everyone can discuss and revise it."
    Qiu Yu Niang of Jin Bang Niang's group spun very coarse thread. When others told her, not only did she not correct it, but she said: "I've been like this my whole life, I can't join the group and be restricted." The issue of coarse and fine thread also occurred in other groups. After everyone discussed it, they all felt that people who spun coarse thread were not unable to spin fine thread. They were doing it to earn more work points, so everyone explained to these people: "Coarse thread weaves less cloth, fine thread weaves more cloth. If you try to take advantage of it yourself, everyone will suffer." Some people who really couldn't spin fine thread were allowed to do other work, such as winding thread, netting thread, and washing paste cloth.
    Without the above difficulties, the finished products of the textile group came out. Everyone was very happy to distribute the dividends. Zhao An Niang's group used sixty-four work points, wove eight quilt covers, and sold them for a total of 40,000 yuan. After deducting all costs, they earned a net profit of 30,500 yuan. Each work point was entitled to a dividend of 476 yuan. In two months, Dong Lin Niang received a total of five zhang of cloth and 3,600 yuan. Xiao Gai Niang's group's first dividend (ten days or so), the most received one zhang and one chi of cloth and 1,200 yuan, the least received six chi of cloth and 400 yuan.
    Some spinning women with no male labor force raised, "What to do since no one is doing the farm work?" The village helped solve the problem by exchanging labor with the mutual aid team. The method of calculating work points was that a male laborer picking twenty catties of cotton counts as one work point, and women spinning four ounces of thread, weaving one zhang of cloth, making a pair of shoes, making a pair of socks, etc., also each count as one work point. This method was beneficial to both parties, and spinning women with no male labor force became even more active.
    After everyone worked together for a while, they were educated by actual benefits. Ji Dong Niang and her children all wore new clothes this summer. Zhao Junren made two new quilts this year, Dong Lin made two new outfits, and Dong Lin Niang herself also wore new clothes. These benefits became the material for people to talk about, and therefore also became a living textbook for those who had not participated, influencing them to automatically request to participate. Wen Yu Niang (a widow who had been struggled against) asked Xiao Gai Niang to intercede, requesting to participate in textile work. Zhao An Niang's group alone added four people. Now, the entire village has organized fifty-four women into six major groups, and every morning and night, the buzzing sound of spinning wheels fills the entire village.

　　李省庄纺织小工厂
  　怎样建立起来的
    朱波
    李省庄生产互助，在邱县是比较有基础的一个村庄。全村百分之百的参加了互助，但妇女纺织还未组织起来。
    今年春天，村里提出组织纺织互助组，妇女们都乱嚷吵起来了。李王氏说：“把俺赶出李省庄，俺也不加入纺织厂。”村干李致文向小改娘说：“十嫂子，你怎么还不带头参加纺织组？”十嫂说：“俺不参加什么互助！”致文又说：“叫你参加你就参加，怎么说不参加呢！”小改娘说：“叫互助就互助，叫跳井也跳井吗？”碰的李致文再不说了。领导上看着群众的思想还没有通，决定先开个动员大会，将话说明白，再动员组织。
    第一次妇女大会上，主席将纺织互助的好处说了一遍，当说到“参加纺织是自愿的，绝对不强迫”的时候，大部分妇女都走了，随走随说：“只要不强迫，俺就不参加。”留下一些较积极的妇女，在一块讨论起来，决定自己先参加，然后下去分头找自己对象（感情好的），进行个别动员。积极分子兆安娘动员东林娘时说：“你东林长了十九岁，连一件新衣裳也未穿过，你参加了纺织，我敢保你穿上新的。”东林娘说：“参加到行，俺可没有本钱！”兆安娘紧接着说：“那个可不算啥，我借给你。”老郭娘提出不能在一块纺，“俺家没有人，孩子爹又担任着工作。”兆安娘说：“行了，咱成起小工厂来，也不是一定在一堆做活，各组自己找地方，你那组就到你家门上。”动员成福娘时她说：“好几口子人还顾不上穿，怎么能加入组里织卖布？！”兆安娘给她解释：“先织自己穿的布，以后才织卖布哩。”老三嫂就说：“俺白天带孩子，又喂牛，又做饭，自己还顾不过来哩！”积极分子给她说：“大空（长时间）不能纺，抽空（短时间）纺，白天不能纺，夜里纺，孩子闹，等孩子睡了纺，不能多纺，少纺点。”三嫂子听了，说：“行，俺先试试吧。”许多青年妇女，提出参加纺织组，怕不随便，以后不能住娘家。给她们解释说：“纺织的多，赚的钱多，纺织的少，赚的钱少，住娘家不住娘家在自己。那怕参加两天，你要说不愿意参加了，也叫你退出来。”经过这次个别动员串连，大部分妇女抱着“试试看”的心情参加了。组织了四、五个小组，公推兆林娘为小工厂的厂长、张金秀等四人为委员，又聘请两个男人李玉堂、李致岭为委员，负责计工、卖成品、买原料。
    开始纺织，遇到的第一个困难是缺乏资本和工具，村合作社负责借了五十斤棉花，妇女们自己又凑了一些，运去织军布的一部分工资也入进去，织布机和纺车，由小组里统一适当配备。其他杼、梭等零件，暂由合作社贷款买新的，将来从红利里解决。
    刚才动工，芳臣娘给组长兆安娘说：“俺孩子快娶媳妇哩，俺得准备准备，现在可不能纺！”书齐娘因为书齐在前线负了伤，她成天上医院，也向组长请假，兆安娘都很爽快的允许了。全组共五个人，三个人告假，两个人不能织布，兆安娘和小一娘组、云聚娘组商量着三组暂时合成一个大组。
    纺织没有多久，她们又接连提出“停的多少怎么办？做的快慢怎么办？卖了钱怎么分？”等问题，领导上看到许多群众都这样反映，结合农业互助的经验，认识到这是一件大事，就发动各小组自己讨论评工、分红的办法。小改娘组讨论时，小改娘对组员们说：“咱们也象互助大队一样做法不行吗？”接着，她又说：“评工评好了，谁做多做少、做快做慢，也好办啦，也解决啦。”大家都说：“行，行，就这样办。”紧接着，又有人提出：“咱们做的活，和互助大队里不一样，评工怎么能跟人家学？”小改娘又解释说：“咱们学他们的办法，还是按咱做的活来计算。”这时几个积极分子说：“织一丈布，算一个工。”大家伙随着说：“行！”“网一斤十二两线，算一个工”“搓四斤棉花，算一个工”“行，行！”组员们亦跟着说。当提出“纺七两线子算一个工”的时候，富身娘截住说：“纺七两线，算一个工不上算，不公平。”又改成纺五两线算一个工。并决定按赚的红利多少，平均一个工分多少钱，出工多的多分，出工少的少分。最后，小组长说：“咱先照规定的这样做，以后谁说这样做不行了，大家伙再讨论改正。”
    金榜娘组的秋玉娘，纺线很粗，别人说她，她不但不改正，反说：“我一辈子啦，就是这样，不能入了组受制。”其他组里也发生了纺线粗细问题，大家讨论了一番，都感觉纺粗线的人不是不能纺细线，她们是为了多挣工，大家就向这些人解释：“粗线织布少，细线织布多，你自己想沾便宜，结果大家都吃了亏。”有些人实在不能纺细线，就让她们做别的活，如拐线、网线、洗浆布等。
    没有了上面那些困难，纺织组成品出来了，大家都很高兴的分了红，兆安娘组用了六十四个工，织成了八个花被面，共卖了四万元，除去一切成本，净赚三万零五百元，每个工该分四百七十六元的红利，两个月的时间，东林娘共分了五丈布，三千六百元。小改娘组第一次分红（十余天），最多的分到一丈一尺布，一千二百元，少的分六尺布、四百元。
    有些无男劳动力的纺妇，提出“庄稼活没有人做，怎么办？”村里帮助解决了和互助大队里换工，算工办法是男劳力摘二十斤花算一个工，妇女纺四两线、织一丈布、做一双鞋、做一双袜等，也各算一个工，这个办法对双方有利，无男劳动力的纺妇，更积极了。
    大家互助干了一段，以实际利益教育了大家，继东娘和她的孩子，今年夏天都穿上了新衣服。赵军人今年做了两床新被子，东林制了两身新衣服，东林娘自己也穿上新衣服。这些好处，成了人们说话的材料，因此，也成了对未参加者的活教材，影响她们自动要求参加。文玉娘（被斗争过的寡妇），托小改娘说情，要求参加纺织，仅兆安娘组里就增加了四个人。现在全村共组织起来五十四个妇女，分六大组，每天早晨与夜里，纺车嗡嗡的声音，充满了全村。
