　　Down with Chiang Kai-shek!
  　Avenge our class parents!
  　Taiyue Military District held a sorrowful rally to swear a public memorial for family members brutally murdered by landlords.
    [Our Taiyue Report, 2nd] After land reform education, the directly subordinate units of the Taiyue Military District Headquarters and Political Department greatly enhanced their class consciousness and held a public memorial meeting on the 26th of last month for the deceased parents and siblings who were victims of the landlord class. All soldiers and cadres wore mourning flowers on their chests. The soldiers of the guard company were especially sorrowful and tense; they wrote "Avenge our class parents!" on white paper and pasted it on the butts of their guns. The cooks, without guns, pasted it on their rolling pins and kitchen knives, and the communication soldiers pasted it on their chests, taking this as an action slogan that could never be forgotten. Inside the memorial hall were arranged the spirits of 323 deceased parents and siblings. After the chairman pointed out that these deceased parents and siblings were all killed by the landlord class, he called on everyone to be determined to demand this blood debt from the landlord class and avenge the dead. Commander Liu of the military district stood before the spirits, tears of grief welling up, his throat choked with emotion. But he finally endured the pain and loudly said to everyone: "Our poverty was all given to us by the old society's feudal system. The feudal landlords are our enemies, and Chiang Kai-shek is the root of it all. We must turn grief into strength, resolutely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and avenge our martyred class parents!" During the public memorial, the determination to avenge class parents was further strengthened, and people swore revenge before the spirits of the deceased. Zhao Jiuwei, a soldier of the guard company, stood before the spirits and read his pledge of revenge while weeping: "You died so miserably! I will never forget this blood feud! I will forever follow the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army to avenge you!" Finally, he broke down in tears and was helped down by the chairman. Shi Zilin, a soldier of the political security squad, said with tears in his eyes: "My family has been exploited and oppressed by landlords for three generations. My grandparents and father were all forced to death by landlords. I am truly sorry to you and to the Communist Party. Last year I was not focused on my work and wanted to go home. Now I realize that this was wrong. I am determined to work to the end in the Eighth Route Army to avenge you!" Moved by this, a captured KMT officer also spoke of his suffering and vowed to avenge his parents. He said, "I used to be a tool for Chiang Kai-shek, and my whole family was sent to their deaths by the Chiang bandits. I want to avenge my parents. I am 35 years old this year, and from now on, I will always be under the leadership of the Communist Party. I will not rest in peace until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown!" Finally, a solemn oath was taken before the spirits: "We clearly remember that all the crimes here were committed by the landlord class and Chiang Kai-shek. We must wipe away our tears, turn grief into hatred, turn hatred into strength, avenge our tragically deceased parents and siblings. If Chiang Kai-shek is not overthrown, the peasants of the whole country will not be liberated, and we will never go home!" After the oath, a procession of hundreds of people carried the spirit tablets in a parade for burial.

    【本报太岳二日电】太岳军区司、政直属队经土改教育大大提高了阶级觉悟，于上月二十六日举行公祭被地主阶级残害的被难父母兄弟大会。所有战士干部，胸前都佩戴丧花，警卫连的战士们更为悲愤、紧张，他们以白纸写着“为阶级父母复仇！”贴在枪托上。炊事员没有枪，贴在赶面杖和菜刀上，通讯员贴在胸前，将此作为永不能忘记的行动口号。祭堂内排列着三百廿三位被难父母兄弟的英灵，主席在指明这些被难父母兄弟都是由地主阶级害死之后，便号召大家决心和地主阶级索还这笔血债，为死者复仇。军区刘司令员站在灵前，悲痛的热泪直涌而下，咽喉也被塞哑了。但是终于忍痛大声向大家说：“我们的穷苦，都是旧社会封建制度给予的，封建地主是我们的敌人，而蒋介石便是总根子。我们要将悲痛变为力量，坚决消灭蒋介石，为死难阶级父母复仇！”公祭之中，为阶级父母复仇的决心更加坚定了，纷纷在死难者灵前宣誓复仇。警卫连战士赵九位，站在灵前痛哭的读着复仇决心书：“你们死的苦呀！这血海冤仇，我永远不能忘记！我要永远的跟着共产党八路军，为你们复仇！”最后他泣不成声，被主席扶下去。政卫班战士石子麟流着泪说：“我家三辈子被地主剥削压迫，爷爷奶奶父亲，都被地主逼死了，我真对不起你们，也对不起共产党。去年不安心工作，想回家，现在我已认识，这是错了。我决心在八路军里干到底，为你们复仇！”被感动了的解放军官，也诉起苦来，决心为父母复仇。他说：“我过去为蒋介石当工具，而我的全家，都被蒋匪送死了。我要替父母报仇，我今年三十五岁了，以后要永远在共产党的领导下，不打倒蒋介石死不瞑目：”最后在灵前悲壮宣誓：“我们清楚的记着这里罪恶都是地主阶级蒋介石所作的，我们要擦干眼泪，把悲痛变为仇恨，把仇恨变为力量，为惨死的父母兄弟复仇，不打倒蒋介石，全国农民没有翻身，决不回家！”宣誓之后，数百人的行列，抬着灵位游行安葬。
