　　[Report from the Jinnan Bureau on the 12th] Xiaozhai in the Second District of Jize County is a key village in the county. The work there was considered relatively good. It had undergone four or five movements, especially the re-examination this spring. Houses were even exchanged with six landlord households. The land and housing problems seemed to be solved on the surface. However, after this in-depth investigation of poor peasants, it was still not thorough. Although the landlords' land was less than that of the poor peasants, it was good land. For example, Dong Xingwu, with a family of three, still farmed 12 mu of well-irrigated land. Dong Shanji, with a family of two, still lived in three brick-topped houses, which were much better than those of the poor peasants. In terms of hidden wealth, it was even less thorough. Apart from the big landlord Dong Lao Xiang, who was forced to hand over 600 yuan in cash, no hidden or transferred wealth was unearthed. The masses said, "They are all old landlords, how could they not have money?" "Chen Shanzheng still runs a large general store, not to mention cash, there must be a lot of foreign goods!" "When we carried the old rich man's cabinets, they were all empty. Isn't it obvious that the landlords had moved their belongings away?" Therefore, the landlords' lives were very wealthy, and they did not work. After Chen Shanzheng was struggled against and ran away to Xingtai, the women in his family ate well, dressed well, bought firewood to burn, and could still support their two daughters. The military dependents landlords Dong Qingzhang and Dong Jingdu, etc., each retained four and a half mu of land, which was still good land and included well-irrigated land. They each had about two large tile-roofed houses and only donated one or two pieces of production tools out of two sets, and those were unusable. Nothing was done about their hidden wealth, and they still ran a flour mill and a grain mill, and did not farm at all. Dong Xuxiang also measured wheat to eat and bought firewood to burn. In terms of politics, the masses said, "The struggle was very light, and the landlords were not convinced in their hearts." When Dong Lao Mu was struggled against this spring, he argued strongly the first time the masses reasoned with him. Chen Jinyou said when the masses were ringing the bell to hold a meeting, "The bastards are holding a meeting." Dong Shanji openly did not recognize the rationality of the struggle when he saw our cadres. In particular, Yin Liandong openly asked, "I don't know why I was struggled against." Furthermore, from the perspective of the emancipated peasants, their lives were still far behind those of the landlords. For example, the poor peasant Zhao Bisi, with a family of four, only had a tattered quilt on the kang. More than a dozen households, such as Liu Guomin's, were not only wearing very ragged clothes, but also could not get enough food. Why wasn't it thorough? The main reason was that a leading core that fully represented the interests of the poor peasants had not been established. The determination of the targets of struggle and the designation of households as automatic, etc., were all decided by a few activists. Now the poor peasants clearly realize "If we want to eat, we have to do it ourselves!" and take the initiative to be masters of our own affairs. As Wu Guifu said, "If we want the poor to be in charge, we must carry it out thoroughly."

### 小寨贫农没当家几次斗争不彻底

　　小寨贫农没当家几次斗争不彻底
    【本报冀南十二日电】鸡泽二区小寨是该县基点村，工作被认为较好，曾经过了四、五次运动，特别今春复查，还与六户地主换了房子，土地房子问题从表面上看得到解决了，一经这次深入贫农调查，仍不彻底。地主的土地，虽数比贫农少，却是好地。如董星吾三口人，还种井地十二亩，董善计两口人，仍住三间匾砖到顶的房，比贫农还强的多。在内财上，更不彻底，除大地主董老祥斗出六百元现洋外，其他蛰财、飞财都没搞出来。群众说：“净是老地主，还能没银钱？”“陈善政还开着大杂货铺，别说有现洋，洋货也少不了呀！”“咱抬老财的柜时，净空的，这不是明摆着地主的东西都运跑了吗？”因此，地主的生活吃、穿都很富裕，也不劳动。陈善政被斗，跑到邢台，家里妇女吃好的，穿好的，买柴火烧，还能经常养着自己两个闺女。军属地主董清章、董景杜等的土地，每人留四亩半，还是好地，并有井地，房子差不多每人合两间大瓦房，两套生产工具的只献出一两件，还不能用；内财上一点没动，还开着粉坊、粮坊，根本不种地。董胥祥也是量麦子吃，买柴烧。在政治方面，群众说：“斗的很轻，地主内心都不服气。”如今春斗争董老目时，头一次群众与他说理，他还强辩。陈金有在群众敲钟开会时说：“杂种开会哩。”董善计见了我们干部，公开不承认斗争合理，特别殷连栋，公开提出：“我不知因为啥挨斗。”再从翻身农民上看，比起地主生活来还相差很远。如贫农赵必四，四口人，炕上只有一条破被子。刘国民等十几户，不但衣裳很破，粮食也是接济不上。为啥没彻底呢？主要原因是没建立起完全代表贫农利益的领导骨干，对斗争对象和确定自动户等等，都是少数积极份子当家所致。现在贫农清楚认识了“要吃饭，自己干！”自己来当家作主。如吴桂福说：“要叫咱穷人当家，一定得搞彻底。”
