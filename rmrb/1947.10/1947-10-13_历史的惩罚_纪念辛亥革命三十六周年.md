　　Historical Punishment
　　Commemorating the 36th Anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution
　　Dong Biwu
　　It has been thirty-six years since the Xinhai Revolution. The great historical significance of this revolution was the overthrow of the traitorous, incompetent, and extremely corrupt Qing Dynasty, ending thousands of years of imperial rule and establishing the Republic of China. However, the result of the revolution was a failure. In terms of time, the first sixteen years saw the remnants of the imperial system, the Northern Warlords, usurp the fruits of the revolution, and the latter twenty years were ruled by the reactionary clique within the Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai-shek. The democratic liberation of the Chinese people and the independence of the Chinese nation have never been truly realized.

　　Thirty-six years have passed, and the Chinese people have inherited the unfinished cause of the Xinhai Revolution, and deeply believe that the democratic liberation of the Chinese people and the independence of the Chinese nation will certainly be truly realized. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique has always relied on imperialism to betray national interests. When the Japanese invaders forcibly occupied the Northeast, Chiang Kai-shek did not allow the Northeast Army to resist; when the Japanese invaders wanted to occupy North China, Chiang Kai-shek used He Yingqin to sign an agreement with Umezu to offer it up; after the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique completely embraced American imperialism. The signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty virtually sacrificed all Chinese national interests. The inequality of this treaty exceeded the Twenty-One Demands by many times. China's territory, territorial waters, and airspace were almost entirely sold to the United States by Chiang Kai-shek. American imperialism instigated the Chiang government to trade with Japan, with whom a peace treaty had not yet been agreed upon, and the Chiang government actually accepted it. What Chiang Kai-shek is implementing is national subjugation.

　　The rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is a feudal and fascist rule. It has completely deprived the people of any basic rights and torn up the universally praised resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. American imperialism, however, felt that he was not good enough at playing tricks to deceive the Chinese people, and personally directed and embellished Chiang's fascist dictatorial face, dressing it up with some semblance of democracy, roping in a few political beggars to convene a puppet National Assembly, create a puppet constitution, and reorganize the puppet national government. Thus, Chiang boasted that it was a "multi-party government" and a "democratic government"; but in reality, the people's lives had no guarantee, let alone the rights of freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and residence.

　　The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, relying on political power, stole from the national treasury; controlled state-owned enterprises; looted enemy and puppet materials; accepted bribes from American imperialism (which appeared in the form of loans and aid); strangled all national industry and commerce; and exploited the Chinese working people, causing them to lose the basic conditions for survival. What Chiang Kai-shek is implementing is a people-killing policy.

　　The Chinese people's public enemy, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, is as ferocious, as corrupt, as traitorous, and as reactionary as the Qing Dynasty; but the Chinese people already have the leadership of the Communist Party.

　　For more than twenty years, the Chinese Communist Party has been with the broad masses of the people, constantly striving for the democratic liberation of China. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, without the assistance of any country, it independently resisted the attacking Japanese invaders. It not only stood on the front line, but also went deep into the rear of the Japanese invaders, creating liberated areas in the Northeast and in more than a dozen provinces within the customs, establishing democratic political power, developing production, and improving the people's lives. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, we advocated an unconditional ceasefire and convened a Political Consultative Conference to peacefully resolve domestic problems. We insisted on a democratic constitution, and we demanded the implementation of "land to the tillers." Chiang Kai-shek destroyed the ceasefire agreement, destroyed the Political Consultative Conference, and signed the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty," which sold out China's interests, with American imperialism. We insist on opposing it. We have declared that we do not recognize any treaty signed by the Chiang regime with foreign countries as valid. We have put the slogan of "land to the tillers" into practice and are now carrying out the equal distribution of land. All our work in the liberated areas is in line with the revolutionary Three People's Principles; we have truly carried forward Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit.

　　In order to prolong its fascist rule, in order to continue its super-economic exploitation of the people, in order to arbitrarily sell out the interests of the country and the nation, and in order to facilitate the colonization of China by American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique did not hesitate to tear up the ceasefire agreement time and again, mobilizing the U.S.-equipped army, navy, and air force to attack the people in the liberated areas who love China, love peace, and love democratic freedom, launching an unprecedented large-scale civil war. The civil war launched by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was carried out with the encouragement and support of American imperialism. The irony of history is so merciless: American imperialism has secretly replaced Japanese imperialism in China, and Chiang Kai-shek has openly taken the position of Wang Jingwei to replace him. We, the Communist Party and the people of the liberated areas, have no choice but to rise up in a patriotic self-defense war to resist the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army supported by American imperialism.

　　The civil war has been going on for one year and three months, and the People's Liberation Army has annihilated 1.3 million of the traitorous bandits' armed forces; the People's Liberation Army has begun a nationwide counter-offensive. The good news of the counter-offensive is pouring in like snowflakes, and the military deployment of the traitors has been completely disrupted. The people in the Chiang-occupied areas are suffering from the scourge of inflation and high prices, and are on the verge of desperation. They will inevitably rise up to save themselves. The downfall of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is inevitable. It is also inevitable that American imperialism will do its best to help its running dogs. But no matter how American imperialism helps, it is determined not to save the traitorous bandit group from its doomed fate. American imperialism helped its running dogs launch a civil war in China, dragging the peace-loving, democratic, free, and independent people into the abyss of war after eight years of resistance against Japan. American imperialism and its running dogs will inevitably be punished by history. The end of Japanese imperialism is the end of American imperialism; the future of Wang Jingwei is also the future of Chiang Kai-shek.

　　Compatriots who love the country, love peace, love democracy, freedom, and independence! Comrades-in-arms of the Xinhai Revolution! Loyal followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen! Let us unite and resolutely oppose the colonization of China by American imperialism, oppose American imperialism's help to the traitors in fighting the civil war, oppose the Chiang regime's conscription of soldiers and grain, and overthrow the traitor Chiang Kai-shek! Victory must belong to our people!

　　历史的惩罚
  　纪念辛亥革命三十六周年
    董必武
    辛亥革命已有三十六周年了。这一革命的伟大历史意义，是推翻了卖国无能、贪污腐化透顶的满清统治，结束了数千年的帝制，建立了中华民国。可是，革命的结果是失败的。就时间上谈，前十六年是帝制余孽北洋军阀篡窃了革命的果实，后二十年统治着中国的是以蒋介石为首的国民党内反动集团。中国人民的民主解放，中华民族的独立，一直没有真正实现。
    三十六年过去了，中国人民继承辛亥革命未竟的事业，并且深深相信：中国人民的民主解放与中华民族的独立，是一定要真正实现的了。蒋介石反动集团，一贯是投靠帝国主义出卖国家民族利益的。日寇强占东北，蒋介石不许东北军抵抗；日寇要占华北，蒋介石就用何应钦与梅津签订协定来奉送；日寇投降以后，蒋介石反动集团完全投入美帝国主义的怀抱，中美商约的订立，简直将中国民族利益牺牲个精光。这一条约的不平等，比起二十一条来超过不知多少倍，中国的领土、领海、领空，几乎全被蒋介石卖给美国了。美帝国主义唆使蒋政府与尚未商订和约的日本通商，蒋政府也竟然承受了。蒋介石所实行的是亡国主义。
    蒋介石反动集团的统治，是封建的和法西斯的统治。把人民任何基本权利都剥夺净尽了；把全国举世赞美的政协决议撕毁了。美帝国主义却嫌他还不会玩弄欺骗中国人民的手段，亲身导演，将蒋贼法西斯独裁的面孔涂脂敷粉的扮装出了几分民主的样子，拉拢几个政治乞丐召开伪国大，制造伪宪法，改组伪国府，于是蒋贼自吹是什么“多党政府”、“民主政府”；而实际则人民的生命毫无保障，更说不上言论、出版、集会、结社、居住自由等等权利了。
    蒋介石反动集团凭借政治势力，盗窃国库；把持国营企业；劫收敌伪物资；收受美帝国主义的贿赂（这种贿赂是以借款、助款形式出现的）；绞杀一切民族工商业；剥削中国劳动人民，使人民丧失了生存的基本条件。蒋介石所实行的是民死主义。
    中国人民的公敌蒋介石集团，是与满清一样凶恶，一样腐败，一样卖国，一样反动；而中国人民已经有了共产党的领导。
    中国共产党在二十余年中，一直和广大人民在一起，始终不懈，为中国的民主解放而奋斗。在抗日战争中，没有任何国家的援助，自力抗击了进攻的日寇。不仅站在最前线，而且深入日寇的后方，在东北、在关内十余省内，创造了解放区，建立了民主政权；发展了生产，改善了人民生活。日寇投降后，我们主张无条件停战，召集政治协商会议，和平解决国内问题。我们坚持民主的宪法，我们要求实行“耕者有其田”。蒋介石破坏了停战协定，破坏了政协；与美帝国主义签订出卖中国权益的“中美商约”，我们坚持予以反对。我们已声明：不承认蒋政权与外国签订的任何条约为有效，我们已把“耕者有其田”的口号付之实现，现在正进行着平分土地。我们在解放区的工作，一切均与革命的三民主义原则相符合；我们真正发挥了中山先生的革命精神。
    蒋介石反动集团为了要延长其法西斯统治，为了要继续其超经济的剥削人民，为了要任意出卖国家民族的利益，为了要让美帝国主义便利它的殖民地化中国，不惜两次三番的撕毁停战协定，动员美国装备的陆、空、海军，向爱中国、爱和平、爱民主自由的解放区人民进攻，发动了空前规模的大内战。蒋介石匪帮发动的内战，是在美帝国主义鼓励、支援之下来进行的。历史的讽刺是何等的无情：美帝国主义在中国已暗地里代替了日本帝国主义，蒋介石则公然取汪精卫的地位而代之。我们共产党和解放区的人民，不得不奋起作爱国自卫的战争，以抗击美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石匪军。
    内战已进行了一年又三个月，人民解放军已歼灭了卖国贼的武装力量一百三十万；人民解放军已开始了全国范围的大反攻。反攻捷报雪片飞来，卖国贼的军事部署完全被打乱了。蒋占区的人民受着通货膨胀、物价昂贵的惨祸，已濒于绝境了，他们必然奋起自救。卖国贼蒋介石反动集团的覆亡是必然的。美帝国主义将尽力来援助其走狗亦是必然的。但不管美帝国主义怎样援助，决计挽救不了卖国贼集团覆亡的命运。美帝国主义帮助其走狗在中国发动内战，把爱好和平、民主、自由、独立的人民在八年抗战之后拖入战争的深渊。美帝国主义及其走狗，必然要受到历史的惩罚。日本帝国主义的末路，就是美帝国主义的末路；汪精卫的前途，也就是蒋介石的前途。
    爱国家、爱和平、爱民主、自由、独立的民众们！辛亥革命的战友们！孙中山先生的忠实信徒们！我们团结起来，一致反对美帝国主义殖民地化中国，反对美帝国主义帮助卖国贼打内战，反对蒋政权的征兵、征粮，打倒卖国贼蒋介石！胜利一定是我们人民的！
