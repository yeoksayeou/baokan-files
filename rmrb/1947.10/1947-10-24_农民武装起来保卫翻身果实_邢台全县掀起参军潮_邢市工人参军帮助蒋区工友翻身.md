　　Peasants Armed to Defend the Fruits of Emancipation
  　Xingtai County Sets Off a Wave of Enlistment
    Xingtai City Workers Enlist to Help Workers in the Chiang Kai-shek Areas Achieve Emancipation
    [Our Newspaper Comprehensive Report] Since the Xingtai County Party Committee called for expanding the counter-offensive army, a wave of enlistment has swept the county: During the mobilization meeting in the fifth district, everyone recognized that many landlords from our district had fled to Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan, and there would be no peace until Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang were captured. At the meeting, Yin @ He from Yin Jia Township, led eleven young adults to sign up. Wang Mingqin from Dongniu峪 led seventeen militiamen to enlist. Wang Mingxue from Yangfan led eight people to sign up.翟小五, a landlord who was struggled against in Yao Ping Village, said to the emancipated masses: "Look, I don't attend meetings all day long, and I never miss the work in the fields; you attend meetings and turn the tables all day long, and you delay the work in the fields." At the meeting, the masses exposed these sabotage conspiracies, increased their hatred for the landlords, and raised their class consciousness. Sixteen young adults immediately enlisted. By the 18th, a total of 341 people had signed up to enlist in the district. After studying the current situation and comparing the army before and now in the sixth district, everyone understood. 181 people signed up at the Huangsi key point. The chairman of the Zhongzhuang Farmers' Association led 33 people to enlist. Zhang Erzhuang village chief led 61 people to enlist. Bi Wenying from Zhongzhuang sent his son to enlist. Yang Erling from Xiqingshan mobilized men to enlist. In the first district, five young adults from Daliangzhuang voluntarily signed up to enlist, expressing their determination to fight to Shijiazhuang and capture the landlords alive. Li Shuhan, a comrade from Qianjie, Hehui Village, said: "This year, during the great counter-offensive, we will go to fight Shijiazhuang and capture landlord Dou Jinghua. Who will go? I'll lead the way!" As soon as he finished speaking, 27 people signed up, for a total of more than 80 people in the village. At the conference in the second district, after everyone heard about the counter-offensive situation, Sun Dezhong, a retired soldier from Lizhi Village, who had been wounded in the Jinxiang Campaign and had captured three enemies and seized three guns, wanted to go to the front line again to show his skills. Lao E, chairman of the women's association of Dashe, said: "I sent my eldest son to join the army last time, and this time I will send my second son to join the army." At this meeting, 47 people signed up to enlist, and 27 women proposed to go back and mobilize their men to enlist. 156 people signed up overnight. In the third district, Dengjiazhuang, a key point in Henan, under the leadership of the director of the Armed Forces Committee, 14 young adults have signed up to enlist. At the mobilization meeting of village cadres in the fourth district, after hearing the call from the county party committee, Zhang Wenxing, director of the Armed Forces Committee of Zhangdong, signed up on the spot and brought 15 militiamen to participate in the counter-offensive army. Hao Zhenyi, director of the Armed Forces Committee of Nanliangshe, voluntarily signed up and said: "My older brother joined the army last year, and I will join the army this year." Liu Jingkui patted his chest and said: "I am old, I want to call my son to join the army. I won't let my son come back until old Chiang is killed!" Inspired by them, 70 people voluntarily signed up that day.
    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] On the morning of the 10th of this month, Xingtai City held separate celebrations in each district to celebrate the victory of the overall counter-offensive. After District Chief Hou of the Third District reported the news of the victory of the counter-offensive at the meeting, Comrade Qi Jigang, militia captain of Xiaxijie Beihou in the district, said: "We will give the front line whatever they need; if they need people, I am willing to lead the militia to the front line and not go home until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated." Subsequently, various streets and villages responded to this call. The women in Xiyuan Village also expressed their attitude, saying: "We women guarantee that we will not hold back, mobilize our own men to join the army, and strive to produce in the rear." The next day, the district's Federation of Trade Unions divided into groups to discuss current affairs in order to raise workers' awareness. Everyone believed that to completely eradicate the root of poverty, Chiang Kai-shek must be overthrown in order to live a peaceful life. Tian Hengxiang, a young textile worker, said: "The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army helped me turn the tables and liberated me. I am going to fight Chiang Kai-shek to help the workers over there also turn the tables like us." Under this enthusiasm, 29 people from barbershops, bathhouses, and textile workers have voluntarily signed up to join the army. (Dong Ke)
