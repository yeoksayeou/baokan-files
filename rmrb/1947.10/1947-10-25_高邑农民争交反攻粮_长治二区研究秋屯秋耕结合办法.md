　　Gaoyi Peasants Eagerly Hand Over Anti-Aggression Grain
  　Changzhi Second District Studies Methods to Combine Autumn Stockpiling with Autumn Plowing

    [Our Newspaper, Gaoyi News] After the Ma Xian base point held a village cadre meeting on October 5th to arrange the delivery of anti-aggression grain, the Si Ma Xian village cadres held a meeting that same evening after returning to the village. They immediately convened the farmers' association, reporting the victories of the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive on all fronts, explaining that the large army was advancing south, and the national counter-offensive had begun. Our Party branch should take action to deliver the anti-aggression grain. After a short discussion, impoverished peasant Zhao Lin said, "The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army have helped us to stand up. Now that the Liu-Deng army has overcome several major floods and faced the bandit Chiang's troops, we are not far from complete liberation. Let's put in one last burst of effort and we will soon live a peaceful life. The public grain this year is milled so well and so finely. It's for our anti-aggression army to eat!" Feng Xiaozhong stood up and said (he is very honest and not good at speaking): "I will deliver everything in two days! I will also free up livestock to plant more wheat and prepare to deliver more wheat grain next year. My family will definitely hurry to grind rice." At the meeting, some said three days, some said four days, and finally it was decided to complete the task in seven days, striving to complete it in six days. Someone also suggested challenging the East and West Han villages. The next day, Xiaozhong's family of three ground 285 jin of rice in one day.

    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi News] The Second District convened a meeting of village chiefs, political directors, and financial and grain directors on the 17th of this month to study methods for combining autumn stockpiling with autumn plowing. Cao Linshui said: "I plan to go back today and organize all the men and women, full and semi-auxiliary laborers in the village, divide the village's grinding stones into groups, with four women per grinding stone, each woman grinding five dou of grain as the standard, worth five points. Exceeding five dou, each dou is worth one point five. The remaining laborers will participate in autumn plowing. Laborers returning from autumn plowing during the day will grind one dou of grain at night for one point five work points." After the discussion, everyone's enthusiasm for combining autumn plowing with the delivery of anti-aggression grain was very high, and they put forward several slogans: "Autumn plowing and autumn stockpiling are well combined, men and women, old and young, seize the opportunity, grind it clean, deliver it early, the front-line soldiers are doing well, the front and rear are combined into one force, capturing Chiang alive is guaranteed." Under this slogan, everyone enthusiastically discussed striving to deliver the anti-aggression grain early. For example, Wang Laixi, the political director of Feng Village, said: "My base point wants to challenge the Su Dian base point to complete the autumn plowing and autumn stockpiling work by the 29th. If this task is not completed, I am willing to lose a large red flag and send it to the Eighth Route Army." Under the challenge of these two base points, each base point eagerly started the challenge. (Gao Sheng, Yan Zhang)

　　高邑农民争交反攻粮
  　长治二区研究秋屯秋耕结合办法
    【本报高邑讯】马闲基点十月五号召开村干会议，布置了交反攻粮后，寺马闲村干当天开会回去，晚上即召开了农会，报告了人民解放军各路反攻的胜利消息，说明了大军的南下，全国反攻开始，咱们党支部行动，交纳反攻粮。大家讨论了一会，贫困户赵林说：“共产党八路军叫咱们翻了身，现在刘邓大军经过几道大水，蒋军老贼，咱们离彻底解放时不远了，再鼓最后一把劲，就快过太平日子了，今年的公粮磨碾的又好又细，给咱反攻军吃！”冯小中站起来说（人很老实不会说话）：“我两天交齐！还要腾下牲口多种麦，准备明年多交麦粮，俺家一定赶快去推米。”会上你说三天、他说四天，最后决定七天完成，争取六天交齐。又有人提出要和东西韩村挑战。第二天小中家三人一天推了二八五斤米。

    【本报长治讯】二区在本月十七日，召开村长、政治主任、财粮主任会议，研究秋屯秋耕结合办法。曹林水说：我计划今天回去，把全村的男女全半辅助劳力组织起来，把村的碾子按组分开，四个妇女一个碾子，每个妇女碾五斗谷为标准，顶五分，超过五斗每斗是一分五，其余劳力参加秋耕。白天秋耕回来的劳力，黑夜碾一斗谷一分五工。谈后，大家对秋耕结合交反攻粮的情绪非常高涨，并提出几个口号：“秋耕秋屯结合好，男女老少抓紧搞，碾的净，交的早，前方战士干的好，前后方结合一股劲，活捉蒋贼有保证。”在这口号下，大家就又热烈的讨论，争取早交反攻粮，如冯村政治主任王来喜说：“我基点要与苏店基点挑战，二十九日完成秋耕秋屯工作，完不成这一任务愿输大红旗一杆，八会送到。”在他们两个基点的挑战下，各基点都热烈的挑起战来。（高升、彦章）
