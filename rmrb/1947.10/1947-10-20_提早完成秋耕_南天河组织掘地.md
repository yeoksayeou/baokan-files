　　Complete Autumn Cultivation Early
  　Nantian River Organizes Soil Turning
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] After completing the harvesting of grain on October 2nd, Nantian River proceeded to arrange the remaining autumn harvest work and the discussion and arrangement of livelihood for each mutual aid group. During the discussion, it was discovered that the livelihood arrangements on the land were not working out. The corn had not yet matured, the grain land was being plowed, and the grain land still had beans growing on it. The problem at hand was that people were idle while waiting for the land, and the land could not be cleared. On the evening of October 4th, a meeting was convened with the people of Cao Linshui Brigade and the cadres and activists of the whole village to study how to clear the land. How could the autumn harvest and autumn cultivation be completed together? At the meeting, everyone thought of some solutions. The activists took the lead and said, "We can't wait. We can dig up the land even if the bean stalks can't be plowed, so that the beans can still grow. This way, neither the autumn harvest nor the autumn cultivation will be delayed. Autumn cultivation cannot be relaxed. We should organize the labor force to dig the land." Wang Desheng said, "Men shouldn't forget to turn the autumn soil, and women shouldn't forget to spin cotton. Autumn cultivation is very important and has great benefits. It can remove weeds and also freeze pests to death. It will also be easier to catch seedlings next spring. Breaking the skin in autumn is better than plowing ten times in spring." Lao Ying Cao Linshui said, "Now we must seize the time for autumn harvest and autumn cultivation. The whole village has more than 1,900 mu of autumn land, but only twelve yokes of livestock can plow the land. Each yoke can plow five mu. Just plowing the land without harvesting the autumn crops would take forty days. If we also harvest the autumn crops, it would be difficult to complete even in fifty days. We can't plow it all before it freezes. This calculation doesn't work out. If we organize more than one hundred full laborers in the whole village to carry out a ten-day blitz, each person can dig one mu per day, and they can dig more than one thousand mu. With the livestock plowing the land, it will only take ten days to complete the autumn cultivation. Our brigade is also the same. I plan to organize all the men, full and semi-laborers, in the team to dig the land, and organize some semi-laborers and all the auxiliary laborers and women to strip corn and thresh grain. We must ensure that digging the land, stripping corn, and threshing grain are all done without any delay, and that autumn cultivation is completed early." After this was said, everyone agreed. Cao Linshui Brigade also discussed a concrete plan for the "three no delays" and made specific assignments. On October 5th, another mass meeting was held to mobilize and discuss the plan. The plan was announced at the meeting, and everyone agreed. Each mutual aid group followed this arrangement for their livelihood. Under the slogan "If you want to complete autumn cultivation, organize labor to dig the land; if you want to combine labor and livestock power well, the livestock should plow the land early," the autumn harvest and autumn cultivation movement was further developed.

　　提早完成秋耕
  　南天河组织掘地
    【本报长治讯】南天河在十月二号完成割谷后，随着就布置后一段的秋收工作，各个互助组讨论安排生活。讨论中，发现地里的生活安排不开，玉茭还未成熟，犁谷地，谷地还长着豆子，眼前摆着的问题是人闲等地，地腾不开。十月四号晚就召集曹林水大队的人和全村干部积极分子开会，研究如何腾开地？秋收秋耕怎样一齐完成？会上大家想了一些办法，积极分子起好说：“咱们不能等，各地带豆不能犁也能掘，这样豆子还能长着，这样秋收秋耕都不耽误，秋耕不能放松，我们应把劳力组织起来去掘地”。王德盛说：“男人不忘秋垡地，女人不忘去纺花，秋耕很要紧，好处大，能除草，还能冻死害虫，明年春天也好捉苗，秋天划破皮，赛过春天犁十犁。”劳英曹林水说：“现在秋收秋耕就得抓紧，全村一千九百多亩秋地，只有十二犋牲口能耕地，每犋犁五亩，光犁地不秋收就得四十天，要再收秋，五十天也难完成，不能犁完就要上冻，这样算不过帐来，如果按全村一百多个全劳力组织起来，突击十天，每人一天一亩，还能掘一千多亩，带上牲口犁地，也只有十来天就能完成秋耕。我们大队也是这样，我计划把全队所有男人全半劳力组织起来掘地，组织一部分半劳力和全部辅助劳力及妇女来撇玉茭、打谷，要做到掘地、撇玉茭、打谷三不误，还能早完成秋耕”。这样一说，大家很同意，曹林水大队又讨论出三不误的具体计划，作了具体分工。十月五号又开群众大会，动员讨论，大会上宣布了这个计划，大家都很同意，各互助组就都照这安排生活，在“要想完成秋耕，组织劳力来刨地，要想劳畜力结合好，牲口犁地要起早”口号鼓动下，进一步开展秋收秋耕运动。
