Liberation of the Peking Man Excavation Site

The excavation site of Peking Man, renowned in the world of archeology, Zhoukoudian (located 45 kilometers southwest of Beiping), has gone from being occupied by the Japanese invaders to being plundered by the Chiang bandits for ten years now. Last month, it was liberated for the first time by our Jinchaji People's Liberation Army. When our Jinchaji People's Liberation Army, attacking the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, advanced to Zhoukoudian, the people of Fangshan, who had suffered for ten years under the trampling of the Japanese puppets and the ravages of the Chiang bandits, came out to welcome us. Beside the village of ××, the music teams of two complete elementary schools in Fangshan District played marching songs to welcome the People's Liberation Army to liberate Zhoukoudian. As the ranks of the soldiers marched to the sound of the loud marching songs, their steps seemed even more orderly and powerful. The peasants in the Fangshan border area guerrilla zone, who had been emancipated, saw their own troops coming and let out loud laughter, shouting various welcoming slogans. When our artillery entered the villages and towns occupied by Chiang, the people in the Chiang-occupied areas rushed to the streets to watch. An old man with white hair from the village of ×× near Zhoukoudian, when our army bombarded the Chiang bandit's碉堡 (diāobǎo - bunker/pillbox) on Dragon Bone Hill (located west of Zhoukoudian) at noon on the 13th, said with emotion, "In the year of the Lugouqiao Incident, I saw the Japanese devils at the Liulihe Railway Station taking these cannons south. We common people were slaves without a country for eight years, and now we are still being bullied by traitors. Today, I can finally see my own troops bringing these cannons back from the hands of the Japanese devils. I haven't lived in vain!" The battle to liberate Zhoukoudian began at noon on the 12th. By dusk on the 15th, our army had captured most of the enemy's fortress fortifications, annihilated a part of the enemy, and completely crushed a company of the traitor Zhang Dexiang's puppet Fangshan County Security Brigade and all four major townships under his command. This famous Chinese archeological excavation site was completely liberated. But when our assault troops rushed up Dragon Bone Hill, where Peking Man and Yin-Shang Dynasty relics were excavated, the mountain was already a scene of rubble and traces of defensive fortifications. The excavation sites and houses painstakingly managed by the archeologists who worked in the mountains in the past had long been demolished by the Japanese puppet troops and the Chiang bandits to build bunkers. The solid bunkers built by the Chiang bandit army using the bricks and stones from the excavation sites and houses were destroyed by our artillery fire, leaving only half of the wreckage on the ridge of Dragon Bone Hill, teetering precariously, showing that the fate of these bandits who trampled on the people and destroyed culture was not far from collapse. The sound of the Zhoukoudian liberation cannon fire rang out before the ancient capital of Beiping. The archeologists in the city of culture heard this victorious news, and the day when they can return to Zhoukoudian to excavate our country's ancient treasures is not far away.

　　北京猿人发掘地的解放
    驰名世界考古学上的北京猿人的发掘地——周口店（位于北平西南四十五公里），从沦陷日寇之手到被蒋匪劫收，至今已十年。上月首次为我晋察冀人民解放军所解放。当我进击平汉北段的晋察冀人民解放军阵地周口庄推进时，十年来饱受日伪蹂躏与蒋匪摧残的房山人民纷纷出迎。在××村边，有房山一区两个完小的音乐队奏着前进号，欢迎解放军来解放周口店。战士们的行列在嘹亮的前进号声中行进时，步伐更显得整齐而有力。在房山边沿区游击区翻身的农民，看见自己的队伍开来了，发出了响亮的笑声，呼着各样的欢迎的口号。当我军炮兵开入蒋占区村镇时，蒋占区人民争先恐后地涌到大街上来观看。周口店附近××村的一位白发苍苍的老人，当我军于十三日中午炮轰龙骨山（位于周口店西）蒋匪碉堡时，感慨地说：“芦沟桥事变那年，我在琉璃河车站眼见日本鬼子带着这些大炮打到南边去，我们老百姓当了八年亡国奴，现在还受着汉奸们的欺侮，今天能亲眼看见自己的队伍带着这些从日本鬼子手里夺过来的大炮打回来，总算没有白活了！”解放周口店之战从十二日午就开始，自十五日黄昏，我军攻占敌堡垒工事大部，歼敌一部，将守敌伪房山县保安大队汉奸张德祥部的一个中队和四个大乡全部击溃，这一中国著名的考古学发掘场所全部获得解放了。但当我军突击部队冲上挖掘北京猿人和殷商遗物的龙骨山上时，山上已是一片瓦砾和满目防御工事的遗痕，昔日在山中从事挖掘研究工作的考古学家们所苦心经营的挖掘场所和房屋，早已被日伪军和蒋匪拆掉修了堡垒，而蒋匪军用挖掘场所房屋的砖石修筑起来的坚固堡垒被我炮兵轰毁之后，只剩大半截残骸留在龙骨山岭摇摇欲坠，显示着这些蹂躏人民摧残文化的匪徒的命运，离土崩瓦解之时不远了。周口店解放的炮声在故都北平之前响起来了，文化城中的考古学者们听到这胜利的捷音，重返周口店发掘我国古代珍宝之期也不远了。
