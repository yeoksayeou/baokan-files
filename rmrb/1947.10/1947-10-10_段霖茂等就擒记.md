　　Record of the Capture of Duan Linmao and Others

　　I. "Will the people curse me as a loyal running dog of Chiang Kai-shek?"

　　The entire 57th Division of the Chiang army at Shatuji collapsed completely. Under the fierce artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army, Lieutenant General Division Commander Duan Linmao fled in panic. But he was captured by the People's Liberation Army as soon as he escaped to the soybean field in the southeast suburbs. The People's Liberation Army seized Duan Linmao's order of September 8th during the battle, in which he strictly ordered all Chiang army officers and soldiers of the division defending Shatuji to hold fast and wait for reinforcements, and to "coexist with the position." He also announced that "this division commander will share life and death with all the officers and men." However, he himself was the first to fail to execute his own order and became a prisoner of the People's Liberation Army.

　　When Duan Linmao arrived at the PLA front command, he was still dressed as a orderly. He had changed his name and disguised himself as his orderly, Huang Jiakui, wearing a semi-old American military uniform, with a two or three-inch long black beard, no hat, and curly hair. His former prestige was gone. He said dejectedly, "Our army is corrupt and aging, and I have become a walking corpse myself." He complained about the Fifth Army, saying, "We were under the command of the Fifth Army and cooperated with them in combat, only thirty or forty miles apart, but we were beaten for a day and two nights, and the Fifth Army sat idly by." He explained the reason for this failure, saying, "Our troops have many new components and are not good at mobile warfare. After marching continuously for more than a month, they were exhausted, and desertion and attrition were very serious, and they lacked food and ammunition. When we went north from Cao County, our rear lines of communication were cut off by your army. The officers and soldiers had long lost their fighting spirit, how could they withstand your army's attack!" He begged a certain section chief of the People's Liberation Army, "Our families are still in Xuzhou, please do a good deed and forward a family letter for me. It is best to release my quartermaster back, otherwise my accountant in Xuzhou will abscond with the money." According to prisoners from that unit, Duan Linmao had two Japanese wives and assets of 100 million yuan.

　　Duan Linmao looked uneasy and incoherent. He asked a PLA soldier in fear: "Will the people curse me as a loyal running dog of Chiang Kai-shek?"

　　II. Becoming a Prisoner of His Own Orderly

　　With Shatuji captured, Li Kun, deputy platoon leader of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, led a squad to search for the remaining enemy in groups. In a backyard, they found a narrow alley blocked by sorghum stalks and weeds. Li Kun quickly lit a fire, pulled away the sorghum stalks and weeds, and the firelight illuminated a few figures in the alley. Li Kun immediately shouted, "Come out! Come out! If you don't come out, I'll kill you with a grenade!" The figures trembled and quickly replied, "We're coming out, we're coming out!" Four people walked out of the alley, and the one in front said in a trembling voice, "We only have one pistol."

　　Suddenly, a flashlight shone on Li Kun's face, and the person speaking asked in surprise, "Is your surname Li?" Li Kun didn't answer. He snatched the flashlight and pistol and immediately shone it on the other person. He saw a Chiang army officer in his forties or fifties standing in front, with a pair of round eyes. Li Kun recognized him: "Aren't you surnamed Wang?" Li asked him. It turned out that this was Wang Lizhi, the major general and deputy brigade commander of the 60th Brigade.

　　In the summer of 1945, Wang Lizhi was the deputy commander of the Chiang army's Jiangnan Assault Corps, and Li Kun was his orderly. In the Battle of Xiaofeng, Li Kun was liberated by the New Fourth Army and joined the New Fourth Army. At that time, Wang Lizhi escaped by chance, but now he became a prisoner of his own orderly on the south bank of the Yellow River.

　　"Old Li!" Wang Lizhi held Li Kun's hand and wouldn't let go. "Old Li, don't talk about my past, just say I'm a clerk. Old Li, please find a way to send me away!" Wang Lizhi pleaded timidly. Li Kun's reply was, "Don't be afraid, I'll send you to the company headquarters. We treat all prisoners with courtesy."

　　Wang Lizhi continued to beg, "I'm injured in the foot, and I still have children and a wife!" Li Kun ignored him. Wang Lizhi then took out a large pile of Chiang currency, and the three people behind him also took out thick stacks of Chiang currency. "Take it for pocket money, Old Li," Wang Lizhi continued to plead, "You are insulting me!" Li Kun said sternly to him, "We don't allow this in the People's Liberation Army!"

　　Wang Lizhi despaired, lowered his head, and obediently followed Li Kun's orders.

　　III. How Could Such an Army Not Fail?

　　A large number of prisoners streamed down from Shatuji. A cook from Duan Linmao's headquarters kitchen, who had just been liberated, pointed to the group of prisoners and said to the People's Liberation Army, "That one wearing a soldier's raincoat, short in stature and with a dark face, is Brigade Commander Luo of the 27th Brigade; that one is Director Li of the Political Department." The PLA soldier in charge of collecting prisoners immediately mobilized them to confess voluntarily, but they still hesitated and refused to admit it, trying to muddle through. The cook angrily ran to Luo Jueyuan and scolded, "Today you pretend to be a coward, where is the fierceness you used to have when you shot my brother?! Look at the bear-like appearance you have now!" Luo Jueyuan lowered his head and walked out of the group of prisoners, and Li Tiqing and others also shamefacedly stood out and confessed their positions and names.

　　Luo Jueyuan was in the Liberated Area for the second time. The first time was in March of last year, when the plane he was on was forced to land near Daxuzhuang in the Huaibei Liberated Area and was captured by the People's Liberation Army, and was immediately escorted out of the country. He recalled, "I was treated kindly by Commander Zhao of your army at that time, and I feel very ashamed now!"

　　Zhang Yubin, the bald-headed and mustached colonel and deputy brigade commander of the 117th Brigade. "I graduated from the Wuhan Student Corps," he said, "They (the Chiang gang) determined that I was equivalent to the sixth class of the military academy, and when they wanted to save face, I said I was from the sixth class of the military academy." Then he said, "Now graduates of the military academy are not popular either, only graduates of the Sino-American training class are tough." He quoted others as saying, "The Communist Party can not only command its own troops to fight, but also command the actions of the Kuomintang army (referring to the Chiang army)." He gave an example, "The People's Liberation Army led us to the Jiaoji Railway, and then suddenly turned back to the west. We had to take a part of our troops to follow you (the People's Liberation Army), running day and night. As a result, the initiative was completely in the hands of your army." He shook his head dejectedly and said, "We didn't dare to step out of Cao County, and the people all fled. We were blind and deaf. How could such an army not fail!"

　　段霖茂等就擒记
    一、“老百姓是否会骂我是蒋介石的忠实走狗呢？”
    沙土集蒋军整五七师全部土崩瓦解了，中将师长段霖茂在解放军猛烈炮火下慌忙突围逃命，但他刚逃到东南郊黄豆地内，就被解放军生擒了。解放军在战斗中缴获段霖茂九月八日的命令，他曾严令该师所有担任沙土集守备之各级蒋军官兵固守待援，而且要“与阵地共存亡。”他并宣布“本师长与全体袍泽抱存亡与共之决心”，然而他本人首先没有执行自己的命令，作了解放军的俘虏。
    段霖茂到达解放军前方指挥部时，还是勤务兵打扮，他曾经改名换姓，化装做他的勤务兵黄家奎，穿著半旧的美式军便服，满嘴二、三分长的黑胡子，没有帽子，头发鬈曲着，他往日的威风已经丧尽了。他颓丧地说：“我们的军队已经腐败老朽了，我自己已经变成行尸走肉了。”他埋怨第五军说：“我们受第五军指挥配合他们作战，相隔只三四十里，但我们挨了一天两夜打，五军坐视不救。”他解释此次失败原因说：“我们部队新成分多，不会打运动战。连续行军一个多月，拖得精疲力尽，逃亡减员很严重，而且缺少粮弹。我们从曹县北上时，后方交通线就被贵军切断了。官兵早无斗志，怎么能经得起贵军一打”！他向解放军某科长央求：“我们的眷属都还在徐州，请你们积德代转一封家书，最好把我的军需释放回去，不然，我的会计在徐州将会卷款潜逃。”据该部俘虏说，段霖茂有两个日本老婆，一百亿元的家产。
    段霖茂神色不安，语无伦次，他惶恐地向某解放军发问：“老百姓是否会骂我是蒋介石的忠实走狗呢？”
    二、作了自己传令兵的俘虏
    沙土集打开了，解放军某部副排长李坤带着一班人分组搜索残敌，在一家后院里发现一个巷口堵着高粱秸和杂草的狭小的小巷，李坤迅速地点起一把火，拉开高粱秸和杂草，火光就照见了巷里的几个人影，李坤立即大喝一声：“出来！出来！不出来，老子一手榴弹打死你！”人影抖动了一下，连忙回答：“我们出来，我们出来！”四个人走出巷口，前面一个颤声说道：“我们只有一根手枪。”
    突然手电筒光向李坤脸上照过来，说话的人惊喜地发问：“你是不是姓李？”李坤不答。他劈手夺过手电筒和手枪，随即向对方照去。见最前面站的一个四五十岁的蒋军军官，一对圆鼓鼓的眼睛，李坤辨认出来了：“你不是姓王吗？”李问他。原来这就是六十旅少将副旅长王理直。
    一九四五年夏，王理直是蒋军江南突击总队副司令官，李坤是他的传令兵。孝丰之战，李坤被新四军解放，参加了新四军。当时王理直侥幸逃脱，但现在却在黄河南岸作了自己传令兵的俘虏了。
    “老李！”王理直双手握住李坤的手不放，“老李，你不要讲我的过去，就说我是个文书。老李，你想办法把我送走吧！”王理直怯懦地恳求。李坤的回答是：“不要害怕，我送你到连部去。我们对俘虏一律优待。”
    王理直继续哀求说：“脚上负了伤，家里还有孩子老婆呀！”李坤不理他。王理直又拿出一大把蒋币，他后边的三个人也跟着掏出厚厚的一叠蒋币，“你拿去零花吧，老李，”王理直继续央求道：“你侮辱我！”李坤严厉地对他说：“我们解放军里不兴这个！”
    王理直绝望了低下头来，驯服地听从李坤的命令。
    三、这样的军队怎么不失败
    大队俘虏络绎不绝从沙土集下来。一个刚获解放的段霖茂司令部小伙房的伙夫，指着俘虏群对解放军说：“那个穿士兵雨衣个子不高脸黑黑的，就是二十七旅罗旅长；那个就是政治部李主任。”收容俘虏的解放军当即动员他们自动坦白，但他们仍旧犹豫不承认，企图蒙混过去。这位伙夫便怒气冲冲地跑到罗觉元面前喝斥道：“今天你装孬种，你以前枪毙我兄弟的那股凶劲那里去了？！你看你弄得这个熊样！”罗觉元低头从俘虏群中走出来，李梯青等也都赧然的站出来，供认自己的职别和姓名。
    罗觉元是第二次来解放区了，第一次是去年三月间，他乘的飞机被迫降落在淮北解放区大许庄附近，为解放军所俘，旋即被护送出境。他回忆说：“当时承蒙贵军赵司令的优待，现在很觉惭愧！”
    一一七旅上校副旅长张毓彬秃顶大头，满脸短髭。“我是武汉学兵团毕业的，”他说：“他们（蒋家匪帮）检定我相当于军校六期，要面子的时候我就说军校六期。”接着他又说：“现在军校毕业的也吃不开了，要是中美训练班毕业的才硬呢。”他引用别人的话说：“共产党不但会指挥自己的队伍作战，而且会指挥国军（指蒋军）的行动。”他举例说：“解放军把我们引到胶济路，又突然转回向西，我们不得不拿一部分队伍跟你们（解放军）跑，天天跑，夜夜跑，结果主动权完全掌握在贵军手里。”他丧气地摇了摇头说：“我们在曹县不敢出门一步，老百姓都逃光了，我们眼瞎耳聋，这样的军队怎么不失败！”
