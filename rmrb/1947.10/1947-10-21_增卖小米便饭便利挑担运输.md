　　Increase the Sale of Millet Meals to Facilitate Transportation for Carriers
    On September 14th, at a restaurant in Hongtuling Village, Xiyang County, I encountered a group of over thirty farmers carrying clay pots and transporting coal. They were noisily discussing the disaster situation. They all said: "Carrying loads to survive the famine is possible, but the travel expenses on the road are too high, and all the earnings are wasted on the way. We originally cannot afford good food or white flour, but we have to eat it; otherwise, we cannot stay in inns. We have calculated that carrying clay pots from Linlingtou in Pingding to Zanhuang takes four days, consuming five jin of white flour, and we still feel hungry. Five jin of flour costs two thousand yuan, which is not enough to eat, but it's still a lot of money. Each trip wastes more than one dou of corn. If we eat millet, eight jin is enough for four days, costing nine hundred and sixty yuan; it costs less money and keeps people full. The remaining thousand yuan can buy more than one dou of corn, enough to feed two people. Because there are no cooking inns, and no one sells coarse grain meals, we want to bring our own dry food, but we have no grain at home." An old fellow from Pingding said: "If the inns on the road could be converted to cooking inns and serve millet, we could increase the number of carriers from our area." We returned and discussed this situation with the owners of the restaurants in Hongtuling and Dingjiazhuang. They said: "Once we convert to cooking inns, there will not be enough room for guests." This precisely illustrates the significant relationship between cooking inns and carriers and transportation. It also shows that innkeepers and restaurant owners prefer to sell white flour and are unwilling to sell coarse grain meals, mainly because they do not want the trouble and do not understand the hardship of carriers trying to survive the famine. Furthermore, according to Comrade Zhao Zhirong of the Prefectural Commissioner's Office Construction Section and the construction section chiefs of various counties in the First Special District who attended a meeting of the Xiyang County Party Committee to discuss the repair of the Yellow River Road, they also encountered the masses reflecting this problem along the way. They unanimously requested that cooking inns be established along the road, selling less white flour and good food and more millet meals. We believe that this situation is not unique to the disaster-stricken masses in the First and Second Districts. Therefore, we hope that leading comrades in the district and village will pay attention to it. (Yi Shan, Qi Chang)

### 增卖小米便饭便利挑担运输

　　增卖小米便饭便利挑担运输
    九月十四日，在昔阳县红土岭村一家饭店碰到了一群三十多个担沙锅、运石炭的农民。他们在一块儿轰轰嚷嚷的拉扯着灾荒。他们一致说：“担挑渡荒是可以，就是路上盘费出不起，把赚头来都浪费在路上了；我们本来吃不起好饭，吃不起白面，但不吃也不行，不吃就不能住店。我们算了算帐，从平定林灵头担上沙锅，到赞皇一走四天，吃五斤白面，还得受饿。五斤面二千块钱，吃不饱，算起钱来可不少，担一回浪费玉茭一斗多。如果吃小米，四天八斤就够了，合钱九百六十元；花钱不多人还能饱，剩下千数块，能买玉茭一斗多，可养活二口人。因为没有起火店，又没有卖粗米茶饭的，到想自己带干粮，可是家里无粮。”平定老乡说：“如果路上能改成起火店，吃小米，我们那里还能增加一群担挑人。”我们返回来又和红土岭、丁家庄两家店掌柜谈此情形，他们说：“一改成起火店，就住不下了。”这正说明了起火店与担挑、运输有很大关系的。也说明了开店坊、卖饭铺者愿卖白面，不愿卖粗米茶饭，主要是不愿麻烦，不体念挑担渡荒人的苦处。又据一专署建设科赵芝荣同志和一专区各县建设科长到昔阳县委开会讨论修黄河大路时，他们沿途也碰见群众反映了这个问题，岭一致要求路上改设起火店，少卖白面好饭，多卖小米便饭。我们觉得这个情况，未必单是一、二分区灾区群众的要求。因此希望区村领导同志加以注意。（一山、其昌）
