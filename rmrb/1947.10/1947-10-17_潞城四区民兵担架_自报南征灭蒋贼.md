　　Lucheng Fourth District Militia Stretcher Teams
  　Voluntarily Enlist to March South and Eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
    [Report from our Lucheng News] Amidst widespread discussions among the masses in the Fourth District about the victorious news of the great counter-offensive, the young and strong militiamen are all eager to try, voluntarily signing up, and demanding to march south to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Yangjia Village, a small village of twenty households, has twelve young and strong men voluntarily signing up. Zhang Chuncheng said: "This time I join the war, I will strive to be a hero who kills the enemy before returning." Zhang Dongcheng said: "I hate Chiang Kai-shek to the bone. This time I go to war, I will only return when the old roots are completely dug out." In Guzhang Village, twenty-six people voluntarily signed up in one night. After review and repeated persuasion, they barely managed to reduce it by eleven. Huang Nian public security officer Li Fugui (nicknamed Bian Lao San), when he asked to be transferred to the war, the Farmers' Association Chairman Zhu Xiaosan said: "I am old and my words don't count. I want to join the war but it is not possible. Lao San, you go and do a good job. I will farm for you at home, guaranteeing that it won't be delayed at all." Retired soldier Wei Furong asked to be transferred to the war. The village cadres and the masses did not allow him to go. He said unhappily: "I returned from demobilization and I am not even qualified to participate in a battle? I must go this time!" The village cadres saw through his thoughts: he wanted to go to the front line to perform meritorious service for democracy, so they had to let him go. At the district-wide send-off meeting for the militia stretcher teams on October 3rd, everyone expressed their determination and attitude to participate in the war to everyone and set out a plan to perform meritorious service. Miao Gengyan from Hepai Village said: "The last few times I participated in the war, I rushed to go, but the village cadres always said that there was no one in my family and I couldn't leave, which made me very anxious. This time, I must make a great contribution on the front line before returning." Zhou Wuniu and You Lin said: "This time I join the war, I am determined to dig out the old roots, and I guarantee that our third squad will obey the orders of the superiors, complete the assigned tasks, ensure that we do not lag behind or desert, and help and love each other and unite." Li Xiaomao from Yanlizhuang said: "I have been preparing for the war every day. This opportunity has come. I guarantee that I will not violate the mass discipline, and I will also mobilize the masses to overthrow feudalism, publicize how we have turned over here, and help the masses there to turn over as well." Shi Youcai, a cadre of the Chamber of Commerce, was excited to see the enthusiasm of the militia stretcher teams to participate in the war, and said: "Everyone is automatically going to the front line to dig out the old roots and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. We businessmen will help the families of the war participants in the rear to harvest autumn crops and rush to grind wheat, and we must work hard. In addition, each person will be given a box of cigarettes to express our thoughts." Doctor Yang from Huang Nian also stood up and said: "Everyone is going to the front line to participate in the war, and I will also do my best. I will give the two million yuan I have earned to everyone as travel expenses, and I also guarantee that the family members of the war participants, young and old, will not get sick." Under such circumstances, gongs and drums were loudly played to send off the militia stretcher teams participating in the war, each with a happy face. After they left, the autumn harvest and wheat threshing in various villages were not affected, but were fueled even more. Women and children were universally organized to assist in labor. Ding Qimei, chairman of the Women's Salvation Association in Huang Nian, led the women of the whole village to harvest autumn crops. The rice has been harvested. Fifteen women harvested twenty mu of rice in half a night. The women in Wei Village are conducting an autumn harvest challenge. Wu Sanqiao's group of four people harvested nine mu of rice in one day, and some individual women can harvest three mu of rice every day. Now the autumn harvest and wheat threshing in the entire district is being carried out enthusiastically.

　　潞城四区民兵担架
  　自报南征灭蒋贼
    【本报潞城讯】四区群众在广泛讨论大反攻的胜利消息中，青壮民兵纷纷磨拳擦掌，自动报名，要求南征灭蒋贼。杨家庄是个二十户的小村，就有十二个青壮年自动报名，张春成说：“我这次参战要争上一个杀敌英雄才回来”。张东成说：“我恨蒋介石恨透了，这次去参战，什么时候刨净老根什么时候才回来”。故漳村一黑夜就有二十六个人自动报名，经过审查，几次的劝解，才免强减下十一个。黄碾公安员李福贵（外号叫个边老三），要求调他参战时，农会主席朱小三说：“我老了，不算话了，想去参战也不行，老三，你去了好好干，我在家给你种地，保证误不了一点”。荣退军人魏福荣，要求调他参战，村干群众不让他去，他不高兴的说：“我复员回来连个战也没资格参了？我这次非去不行！”村干部看透了他的心思：要去前线为民主立功，也只好让他前去。在十月三号的全区欢送民兵担架大会上，每个人都把自己参战的决心和态度向大家表示，并订出立功计划。河湃村苗更炎说：“上几次参战，我抢着去，村干部光说我家没有人，走不开，不叫我去，可把我急坏了，这次非到前方立上个大功才回来”。周武牛有林说：“我这次参战，决心刨老根，保证我们第三班服从上级命令，完成分配任务，保证不掉队开小差，大家互相帮助友爱团结。”阎里庄李小毛说：“我每天在准备参战，这次机会到了，我保证不违犯群众纪律，还要发动群众斗垮封建，宣传咱们这里是怎样翻了身，帮助那里群众也翻一翻身”。商联会干部史有才，看到民兵担架参战这股劲，激动的说：“大家自动上前线，挖老根灭蒋贼，我们商人在后方帮助参战家属收秋赶麦，也要好好加油干。另外，每人送纸烟一盒，表表我们的心思”。黄碾杨医生也站起来说：“大家去前方参战，我也要尽尽我的心，把我赚下的两万元送给大家作盘费，我还保证参战人员家里大小人不生疾病”。在这样的情况下，锣鼓喧天欢送上了前方参战民兵担架，个个面带喜色。他们走后，各村秋收赶麦并未受到影响，而且是火上加了油，普遍的组织妇女儿童辅助劳力，黄碾妇救主席丁其美，领导全村妇女收秋，谷已割完，有十五个妇女，半晚上割谷二十亩。魏村妇女进行秋收挑战，吴三巧组四个人，一天割谷九亩，还有个别妇女每天能割三亩谷。现在全区秋收赶麦正在热烈开展。
