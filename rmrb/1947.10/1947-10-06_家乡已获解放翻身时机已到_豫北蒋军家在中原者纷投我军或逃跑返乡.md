　　Hometowns Liberated, Time for Emancipation Has Arrived
　　Henan-Based KMT Soldiers in Northern Henan Desert to Our Army or Flee Home
　　[Report from our newspaper in Taihang, 3rd] Since the Liu-Deng army marched south and liberated vast areas of the Central Plains, the remaining KMT soldiers in northern Henan whose families are from the Central Plains feel that the time for emancipation has arrived. They are deserting to the People's Liberation Army with their weapons or fleeing back to their hometowns. In the 529th Regiment of the 177th Brigade of the 38th Division stationed in Jiaozuo, seven people, all from southern Henan, have defected in the past week. Ren Qihai and Zhao Laiyi, soldiers of the 2nd Platoon of the 6th Company of the 6th Battalion of the bandit army 12th Column stationed in this county, fled to our area on the evening of the 14th of last month with two rifles and more than 100 rounds of ammunition, requesting the government to escort them back to their hometowns. The democratic government immediately agreed and issued each of them 40,000 Jichaos, as well as casual clothes, shoes and socks. According to them, the platoon leader of the 1st Platoon of the 12th Company fled with his entire platoon and all their weapons (including two machine guns), and a squad from the 8th Company also deserted with weapons. As for those who deserted in twos and threes, there were even more. As a result, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion and the company commander of the 4th Company were both dismissed from their posts.
