　　Yi's First District Villages Organize Self-Defense Forces
  　Poor and Hired Peasants Armed to Protect the Fields
    [Reported by this newspaper] In the land reform movement in Yi's First District, Taiyue, attention has been paid to organizing armed forces to protect the fields and homes. Recently, treacherous bullies and landlords colluding with secret agents have been active in the district. They have murdered peasants in villages such as ××ying, and villages such as × village have also been disturbed by secret agents. Some awakened peasants have demanded to be armed. Shi ×× of ×× Village said, "The secret agents killed people because we didn't pay attention. If we establish a self-defense force and patrol day and night to check household registrations, the secret agents won't dare to come." The leadership also put forward the slogan "To fight wolves, you must guard against being bitten by wolves." Especially at the public memorial meeting for the martyr Lu Changxu, who was assassinated by secret agents, the home protection teams from × village and × village, carrying guns, spears, knives, pitchforks, hoes, and sickles, marched into the meeting place in a majestic formation. Comrade Zuo Zhi, the district secretary, praised at the meeting the reason why the above two villages, which had established home protection teams, had not been destroyed by secret agents. He educated the masses with facts. After the meeting, a movement to arm and defend the turned peasants was launched in various villages. More than a dozen villages, including Yu ×fen and ×bao, successively established self-defense teams and home protection teams, totaling approximately 500 people, who took up arms to stand guard, patrol, and check pedestrians. Their experiences are: (1) The home protection teams are based on hired and poor peasants. The captain, deputy captain, and squad leaders of the self-defense team in ×× Village are all from poor peasant backgrounds and are active participants in the land reform. It is stipulated that those who are the objects of struggle are not allowed to participate and must be supervised by the masses to maintain the ideological consistency of the class armed forces. Therefore, they are very active and responsible in standing guard and patrolling. On the 14th, Sun Hongfen, a large merchant from Hejin, and Wei Zhiren, were transporting coal to the enemy in Yuncheng and were apprehended while passing through the village. (2) Home protection covenants are formulated. Many villages are generally the same, with the following items: 1. Strengthen guarding, patrolling, and checking pedestrians, and resolutely prevent people without road passes from passing through. 2. When relatives, friends, merchants, and other guests come and stay, they must report to the home protection team. 3. Those who conceal secret agents and objects of struggle without reporting will be severely dealt with once discovered. 4. Going out must be reported, and the home protection team will issue road passes. 5. Children cooperate with the home protection team during the day to stand guard and patrol. 6. Do not leave the post or sleep while standing guard and patrolling. 7. Close the village gates at night and impose a curfew to prevent bad people from being active. (3) Strictly control treacherous bullies, landlords, and all objects of struggle, and clearly put forward the warning: "If good people are killed in any village, the landlords and treacherous bullies will be responsible." The home protection team of × village called ten families who were objects of struggle to sign a guarantee with their lives. (Jinnan People)

　　猗氏一区各村纷组自卫队
  　贫雇为主武装保田
    【本报讯】太岳猗氏一区土地改革运动中，开始注意组织武装保田保家。该区近来奸霸地主勾结特务活动严重，在××营等村杀害农民，×村等亦受特务扰乱，一部分觉悟的农民就要求武装起来，××庄史××说：“特务杀人都怨咱没有注意，咱们成立自卫队，黑夜白天站岗清查户口，特务就不敢来。”领导上也提出：“打狼就要防狼咬人”的口号，特别在公祭被特务暗杀的烈士陆长绪大会上，×村、×庄的保家队，扛着枪矛刀叉镢头镰刀，雄纠纠整队进入会场，区书左直同志在会上表扬了以上两村成立了保家队就未遭受特务破坏的道理，以事实教育了群众，会后各村掀起了武装保卫翻身运动，于×坟、×堡等十余村先后成立自卫队、保家队共约五百余人，拿起武器站岗放哨查行人。他们的经验是：（一）保家队以雇贫为骨干，××庄自卫队长、副队长、班长都是贫农成份，在土地改革中又是积极分子。规定斗争对象不准参加，并要受到群众监视，以保持阶级武装的思想一致，所以站岗放哨都很积极负责。十四日有河津大商人孙洪汾、卫治人等给运城敌人运炭，路过该村就被扣获。（二）订出保家公约。不少村大致一样，有以下几项：一、加强站岗放哨盘查行人，坚决不叫无路条的人过去。二、亲戚朋友来往客商住宿时，要向保家队报告。三、暗藏特务及斗争对象不报告者，一经查出严加处理。四、外出必须报告，并由保家队开给路条。五、儿童白天配合保家队站岗放哨。六、站岗放哨时不脱离岗位，不睡觉。七、天黑封锁村门实行戒严，防止坏人活动。（三）严厉控制奸霸地主及一切斗争对象，明确提出：“那个村子杀害了好人，就由地主、奸霸负责”的警告，×村保家队被叫十一家斗争对象，立下人头保状。（晋南人民）
