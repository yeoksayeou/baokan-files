  　A Special Feature on Logistics Work in Yuncheng

    On September 4th, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the New Fifth Army to retake Yuncheng on that day, regardless of the cost; otherwise, "the Three Principles of the People would collapse (Chiang's telegram)." Thus, a fierce battle unfolded twenty miles outside of Yuncheng. Although the sounds of cannons and gunfire rang out day and night, so urgently, so closely, so frighteningly, I saw that the common people were still so calm and peaceful, not only without any worries, but also seemingly with a new kind of joy—the joy of being able to avenge their hatred of the Chiang army; the joy of the inevitable victory of the counter-offensive—they comforted the children who were used to being frightened, just like they comforted themselves:
    "Don't be afraid, it's our own people!" They led their children out to watch our troops.
    On the 5th, the sounds of guns and cannons gradually faded. But a sound of "pong, pong..." of pounding came from all directions; stubbornly rising and falling, spreading in all directions. With a suspicious heart, I went out to take a look: it turned out that the villagers were pounding sorghum with sticks. They sat scattered on the threshing ground, under the trees, at the doorways, in the courtyards, almost every household, old and young, were doing this work at the same time—spreading bed sheets on the ground; sitting cross-legged; raising the stick high in their right hand, pounding the sorghum with force. Thus, the red oily sorghum grains quickly fell off the stalks and splashed in all directions. The pounding of the sorghum mingled with the rumble of cannons, creating a great chorus of the whole people supporting the war on the front lines. I was deeply moved by this. I sat down next to an old woman of about forty years old. Her headscarf had fallen off because of overwork, turning into a long, uncombed braid. She greeted me with a smile, but did not stop working. I said:
    "Old woman! You're working hard, your hands must be sore!"
    "What are you saying? We have to make sure the troops have food! It doesn't matter if we go hungry for a meal or two, but the people fighting Chiang Kai-shek need to eat their fill to have strength, don't you think that's the truth?" She looked up at me, put the beaten sorghum stalks aside, and continued pounding.
    I replied, "That's the truth, but the day before yesterday, some troops didn't have anything to eat!"
    "That's because the weather was bad and they couldn't make it in time. Now that the weather is good, it's easy to handle. I'm willing to work this hard for a hundred days, rather than have the Central Army stay here for one day. When they came, they took good sorghum to feed the horses!"
    An old man interjected, "That's right. Last time the Central Army came, they casually tore down sorghum stalks and used cars to crush the grain. Everyone cursed them. This time, if it weren't for our troops stopping them, they would have been in Yuncheng yesterday. Comrade! The New Fifth Army should be wiped out at the gates of Yuncheng this time!"
    Before I could answer, the children suddenly shouted happily, hitting a flock of chickens with sorghum stalks, scolding as they hit: "Hey! You dead chickens, you want to steal the Eighth Route Army's food, that won't do. The Children's Corps sisters don't allow it. Go away, you dead chickens!"
    This made the adults laugh, and the children happily crawled on the ground, helping the adults pick up the sorghum that had splashed around, as busy as a flock of chicks pecking at countless little red bugs.
    When I returned to the headquarters, the landlord's mill was turning again, humming constantly, almost sounding like an airplane. I stood at the door of the mill, watching the person turning the mill. Flour covered his head, face, and entire body, as if he had just crawled out of a flour bin. He had become a white-haired old man, but from the sound of him shouting at the mule, I could tell that he was still a strong young man. At this time, he whipped the black mule with force. Although it seemed to me that the mule was already walking fast enough, he was still not satisfied with its work. He cursed angrily:
    "You son of a bitch, don't you grind faster for the Eighth Route Army, ha! Hit! Ha!" At the same time, he scraped the flour from the mill into a sieve, his anxious and angry face turning to joy. He sang:
    "Chiang the bald-headed bastard has no good intentions, he only wants to harm the farmers..." But when he turned his face and saw that the mule was walking a little slower, he immediately raised his fist and shouted: "Ha! Hit! Walk faster, the Central Army will kill you and eat you if they come, see if you still loaf!" He gently stroked the mule's black back, softly comforting it like an innocent child who had been beaten: "Grind well, okay! As long as the Eighth Route Army comes, the Central Army won't be able to kill you." He said to his neighbor with a smile: "This is the fruit I've been given, haha! My little mule."
    ...
    I walked through the entire village of Chuzhai (eight miles from the city) and didn't see a single idle person. Forgive me for not being able to and not needing to write down the names of each of them. Our sincere and vast people are all busily, enthusiastically, and happily preparing food for the People's Liberation Army; working to protect their own interests.

　　紧张而愉快的人们
  　郓城后勤工作特写
    黄铁
    九月四日，蒋介石命令新五军要在这一天，不管多大的牺牲要重占郓城；不然的话：“三民主义就垮台了（蒋电语）”，于是一场恶战，在离郓城二十里外的地方展开了。听起来虽然炮声、枪声整日整夜的响得那么急、那么近、那么怕人，但我看见老百姓们还是那样的镇定、安详，不仅毫无顾虑，而且似乎增加了一种新的愉快——对蒋军仇恨得以报复的愉快；反攻必然胜利的愉快——他们安慰着受惯惊吓的小孩同他们自己：
    “不怕，是自己人来了！”他们带领着自己的孩子们走出去，观望着我们的部队。
    五日，枪炮声已渐远。但从四处传来一种硼硼……的槌打声；固执的此起彼落的传向四方。我带着怀疑的心里走出去看看：原来是老乡们在用棒捶捶打着高粱。他们散坐在麦场上、树林下、房门口、院子里，差不多家家户户老老少少都同时在做着这个工作——把床单子铺在地下；盘脚坐下；右手高拳棒捶，用力捶打高粱。于是，红油油的高粱粒从秆上迅速脱落，向四处飞溅。棒打高粱的硼硼声声中稳稳传来轰轰的炮声，造成了全民支援前线战争的伟大合奏。我为此深深感动，顺便坐在一年约四十岁的大娘身旁，她的卷子，已因过于劳累而掉了，变成了一条未梳的长发辫。她笑着向我打招呼，但并未停止工作，我说：
    “老大娘！辛苦了，手捶酸了吧！”
    “看你说啥话，好坏得让队伍吃上饭呀！俺们饿一二顿不要紧，打老蒋的人要吃得饱饱的才有力气，你说这是实话不？”她抬头问我，把打完的高粱秆放在一边，又捶了。
    我答：“是实话，但前天就有队伍没吃的哩！”
    “那是天气不好，无法制，现在天气好了怎么也好说，我愿这样一股劲忙一百天，也不愿中央军来住一天”，他们来了，这么好的高粱也随便的拿去喂马哩！”
    旁边一老汉插进来说：
    “那准，上次中央军来顺手拆高粱，用汽车压谷子，老百姓那一个不骂；这次不是咱队伍拦着，昨天就到郓城了，同志！新五军这次该得消灭在郓城门口吧！”
    还未等我回答，小孩子们忽呵呵的叫起来，拿着高粱秆猛打一群鸡，边打边骂着：“噫！死小鸡，你想偷吃八路的饭，那可不行，儿童团姊妹团不准。快走，死小鸡！”
    这一来把大人都逗得笑起来，孩子们又嘻嘻哈哈的爬在地下，帮助大人拾起飞溅在四周的高粱，象一群小鸡一样忙碌啄着数不清的小红虫儿一般。
    当我转回指挥部的时候，房东家的磨子又旋转开了，嗡嗡的只叫唤，猛听总有点象飞机的声音。我站在磨房门口，瞧着随磨子转的一人，面粉飞满在他的头、脸，以致全身上，仿佛刚从面缸里爬出来一样，他已成白头老人了，但我从他吆喝着骡子的声音中，听出了他还是个壮年人，此时，他用力的鞭打着黑骡，虽然在我看来骡子走得已够快了，但他还是不满意它的工作，他怒骂着：
    “你狗仔子，还不替八路军快磨，呵！打！哈！”一边他又把面粉从磨上弄到簸箕里筛着，着急的愤怒的脸色已转为愉快了，他又唱着：
    “蒋二秃子没好心，一心要害庄稼人……。”但当他一转脸看见骡子走得稍慢了点，他立刻拳臂高呼：“哈！打！快走，中央军来了把你杀掉吃了，看你还偷懒不？”不知怎么的他又轻轻抚摸骡子的黑色脊背，轻声的象对待一个无辜被打的小孩安慰着说：“好好磨噢！只要八路来了，中央军就没法杀死你了。”他笑着对邻人说：“这是我分得的果实，哈哈！我的小骡子。”
    ……
    我走遍了楚寨全村（离城八里）没有看见一个闲人，恕我不能也不必写出他们每个人的名字我们诚朴的广大人民，都在繁忙热烈而且愉快的为人民解放军准备粮食；为保卫自己的利益而工作着。
