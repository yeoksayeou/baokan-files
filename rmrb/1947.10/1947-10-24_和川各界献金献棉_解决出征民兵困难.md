　　Hechuan Various Circles Donate Money and Cotton
  　Solve Difficulties for Enlisting Militiamen
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, Twenty-second Dispatch] The workers, peasants, merchants, and other circles in Hechuan Town, Anze, voluntarily donated 212,900 yuan and 10 catties of cotton to help the enlisting militiamen solve their difficulties. After the victory celebration of the counter-offensive in Hechuan, thirty-two militiamen actively prepared to set out. Some poor peasant militiamen couldn't immediately afford cotton-padded clothes, so the village deputy Su Shenggou voluntarily donated 20,000 yuan to help the militiamen make cotton-padded clothes. Lü Ditang, a cadre from the Tax Bureau, donated a set of new cotton-padded clothes to the militiamen. Wang Chengyou, a standing committee member of the Peasant Association, donated 20,000 yuan. Women worked day and night to make cotton-padded clothes, shoes, and socks for the militiamen. The Peasant Association organized and controlled the targets of struggle to harvest crops and plant wheat for the enlisting militiamen. Wang Guolai, the director of the Armed Committee who was going on the expedition, said with emotion: "The masses really care about the enlisting militiamen and have solved all our difficulties. I will definitely lead the militiamen to resolutely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's bastards."
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, Twenty-second Dispatch] Militiamen and laborers in various parts of Taiyue continue to enthusiastically participate in the war. Two thousand laborers from Tunliu, led by Comrades Shi Gang and Cheng Zhou from the county government, rushed to the front line on the 2nd. Another battalion of militiamen also gathered on the 9th, led by Comrade Chang Yuwang of the Armed Committee. The expeditionary militiamen from Shangbeili Village, Third District of Qin County, set off on the 30th of last month. At the farewell meeting, Zhang Chuanfu swore: "I made meritorious service in the last expedition to Southern Shanxi, and this time I will go again to add more merits." Three thousand people in Jihe County, a new district in Southern Shanxi, also organized six hundred stretchers and rushed to the front to participate in the war. Ma Yongke and Xue Delong, standing committee members of the Wudui Peasant Association, argued fiercely over who should go, and neither would give way. The chairman of the Peasant Association said anxiously: "Supporting the front line is important, but land reform cannot be neglected. Considering both sides, it is better for one to go." Everyone decided that Xue Delong should go. They also made a plan to make meritorious service in the war.
