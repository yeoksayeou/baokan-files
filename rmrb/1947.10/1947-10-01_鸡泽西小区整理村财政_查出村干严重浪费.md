　　Jize West District Rectifies Village Finances
  　Discovers Severe Waste by Village Cadres
    [Report from this newspaper in South Hebei, 28th] The West District of the Fourth District of Jize County, in rectifying village finances, overcame waste, established systems according to needs, and invested funds in production to strive for self-sufficiency. After the county held a joint meeting of finance cadres, it used the West District as a model for rectifying village finances. The entire district consists of sixteen administrative villages, three thousand one hundred and sixty households, and forty-eight thousand three hundred and ninety-four mu of land. The total burden is equivalent to 257,538.4 fen. From the second month of the old lunar calendar to the end of June, a total of 40,212 jin of wheat was spent, equivalent to 4,443,320 yuan, an average of 16 yuan per mu. Most of the expenditures were for village cadres' meetings, travel expenses, village public office meals, village cadres' smoking and entertaining cadres, militia miscellaneous expenses, etc. In Dongshuangta alone, over 1,000 jin of wheat were used for public meals. In Yongzhao Village, village cadres spent over 50,000 yuan on cigarettes. In Xishuangta Village, village cadres spent over 600 jin of wheat, equivalent to 29,000 yuan, on meeting travel expenses. In Zhongshendi, the militia spent 52,000 yuan in foreign currency to buy bullets. Similar situations existed in other villages. Inappropriate expenses totaled over 3,156,000 yuan, compared to legitimate expenses of 1,266,000 yuan. The ratio of inappropriate expenses to legitimate expenses was three to one. During the rectification, a joint meeting of village-level leading cadres was first convened, where the village head reported on the village's expenditures. Both types of expenditures were discussed and studied by everyone. Finally, everyone agreed that "the waste is too serious and we truly owe it to the masses!" They declared that they would guarantee not to waste another penny in the future. In the spirit of transforming cadres, except for the fact that the Yongzhao Village cadres' smoking expenses were not allowed to be accounted for, the remaining waste was allowed to be accounted for. The required expenditures for each village were also studied. The largest villages (such as Chenshuangta) need an average of 9,500 yuan per month, general villages need 5,000 yuan, and the smallest villages need 2,500 to 3,000 yuan. Based on this amount, it was stipulated that the entire district would distribute 12,190 jin of wheat for half a year. Aside from retaining 2,000 jin for current expenses, 10,190 jin (equivalent to 1,100,000 yuan) were invested in production. According to the production situation in Dongshuangta, each 100 yuan can earn a profit of 170 yuan annually, which means a profit of 1,870,000 yuan per year. Currently, each village has begun to open its own oil mills and steamed bun shops, and some have invested in cooperatives, striving to ensure that the principal is not damaged and to achieve financial self-sufficiency.

　　鸡泽西小区整理村财政
  　查出村干严重浪费
    【本报冀南二十八日电】鸡泽四区西小区，整理村财政克服浪费，按需要订制度，经费投入生产，争取自给。该县召开财政干部联席会后，就以西小区为模范整理村财政，全小区共十六个行政村、三千一百六十户，四万八千三百九十四亩土地，负担共折二十五万七千五百三十八分四厘，自旧历后二月到六月底，共开支麦子四万零二百一十二斤，折款四百四十四万三千三百二十元，每分地平均十六元，开支多数是村干开会、路费、村公所吃饭、村干吸烟并招待干部、民兵杂花等，仅东双塔吃公饭就用麦子千余斤。永兆村村干吸纸烟就用五万余元，西双塔村干开会路费用麦子六百多斤，款两万九千多元。中申底民兵买子弹用洋五万二千元。其他村类似，不应开支款三百一十五万六千余元，较正当开支一百二十六万六千余元，两项比例，不正当开支数占四分之三。整理中首先召开村级主要干部联席会，由村长汇报村开支情形，将两项开支叫大家讨论研究，最后一致认为“浪费太严重，真对不起群众”！并声明今后保证再不浪费一文钱。领导上本改造干部的精神，除永兆村村干吸烟不准派帐外，其余的虽然浪费也都准许派了帐。还研究出各村开支需要数，最大村庄（如陈双塔），每月平均九千五百元，一般村五千元，最小村两千五百元至三千元，根据这个数目，规定全小区半年发麦子一万二千一百九十斤，除留两千斤做目前开支外，并用一万零一百九十斤（折款一百一十万元）投入生产，按东双塔生产情况，每百元全年可赚洋一百七十元红利算，一年可赚洋一百八十七万元。现各村已开始自己开油坊、馍馍坊，也有的投入合作社，争取保证不伤原本，达到经费自给。
