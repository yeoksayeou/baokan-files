Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th. A portion of the Lunan People's Liberation Army advanced into the Yixian and Tengxian plains. As of the 4th of this month, it had recovered the important town of Lanling and strongholds such as Qiaotou, eliminating more than 500 enemies. Our forces advancing east of Yixian have also recovered areas such as Gedun and Sicao Village, eliminating more than 230 enemies, and are directly approaching Yixian city. The forces advancing east of Tengxian also captured strongholds such as Shangxia Huzhu, Zhujiawa, and Weijiagou on the night of the 3rd, and in one fell swoop attacked Dongguo Town, an important stronghold on the periphery of Tengxian, the location of the command of the Chiang-appointed Tengxian County Chief Chu Hanfeng, eliminating 280 enemies.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th. The Jiaodong Military Region Armed Forces Department recently released preliminary statistics on the achievements of the mine explosion and blocking war in the past half month, totaling more than 1,000 landmines exploded. When Chiang's army advanced into the Jiaodong hinterland, the Jiaodong explosion teams set up minefields on the Pingdu-Changyi, Pingdu-Gaomi, Jiaoxian-Pingdu, Laiyang-Pingdu, and Yexian-Pingdu highways and vast areas. On both sides of the Jiaoxian-Pingdu highway alone, more than 340 enemies were killed or wounded. The landmines buried by the Pingdu explosion team in coordination with a certain unit were triggered by Chiang's army more than 300 times. For this reason, the leaders of the Jiaodong Military Region specially commended the Nanhai, Xihai, and Pingdu explosion teams and the Military Region Armed Forces Explosion and Shooting Brigade for their significant achievements in killing enemies with explosions.
