　　Amidst Our Powerful Counter-Offensive,
  　Chiang Kai-shek's Currency Plummets

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th] Due to the powerful counter-offensive of the Northeast People's Liberation Army and the deepening military crisis of the Chiang bandits, prices in the Chiang-controlled areas are once again soaring like a storm. According to reports from various sources, the speed of the Chiang currency's devaluation is "dizzying." Although the Central Bank's official exchange rate for the US dollar remains at 49,500 yuan, the black market price of the US dollar has been soaring for days. On the 6th, the black market price for each US dollar was 73,000 yuan, and on the 7th, it further rose to 83,000 yuan. Compared with August 17th, when the Chiang government revised the foreign exchange regulations, it has increased by more than double. Among food items, the selling price of rice reached 680,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight) on the 7th, and soared to 700,000 yuan on the 8th. This is a sharp increase of 40,000 yuan compared to 660,000 yuan four days prior. The prices of flour and various cooking oils have also risen sharply; the price of cooked vegetable oil reached as high as 1,000,000 yuan per dan on the 6th, an increase of about 100,000 yuan compared to before. In addition, the price of cotton yarn has also risen simultaneously, with cotton reaching as high as 3,500,000 yuan per dan. According to Reuters, the average price of various commodities rose by 10 to 15 percent on the 7th alone. A Shanghai financial commentator said: "Now we have reached a point where if the government does not issue larger bills, we will have to carry money in wheelbarrows." According to the Associated Press, the reason for the skyrocketing prices is mainly due to the "pervasive pessimism throughout the market regarding the political and economic future of the Chiang bandits' rule, and the war situation in Manchuria."

　　我强大反攻形势下
  　蒋币狂跌不已
    【新华社陕北十日电】由于东北人民解放军强大反攻与蒋匪军事危机的深重，蒋管区物价又作暴风式之飞涨。据各方报导：蒋币贬值之速度已“令人昏眩”。虽然中央银行美汇公开市场牌价仍为四万九千五百元。但黑市美钞价格却连日飞涨不已。六日每一美元黑市价格为七万三千元，而七日更涨至八万三千元。与八月十七日蒋政府修改外汇条例时相比，已上涨一倍以上。粮食中，大米的售价格至七日每担已达六十八万元，八日更暴涨为七十万元。较四日前之六十六万元已骤升四万元。面粉及各种食油亦均猛涨；熟菜油六日每担已高达一百万元，较前上升约十万元。此外花纱价格亦同时上涨，棉花每担高达三百五十万元。据路透社称：七日一日内各种商品价格平均上涨百分之十至十五。一上海金融业评论称：“现在已到了政府如再不发行更大票子，我们就要用手推车子携带金钱的时候了。”物价狂涨原因，据合众社称：主要是由于对蒋匪统治“政治经济前途，及满洲战争局势之悲观情绪弥漫全市场”所致。
