　　Propaganda and Mobilization Work in Shexian Seventh District's Autumn Harvest Movement

　　After the teachers of Shexian Seventh District were given a holiday on October 1st, they were unified under the district's leadership to cooperate with district and village cadres to assist in the autumn harvest work. During the autumn harvest movement, the teacher comrades and district and village cadres studied and reorganized the propaganda organization and carried out mass propaganda. For example, villages like Taicang and Taizhuang increased their number of propagandists. In this autumn harvest movement, propaganda and mobilization played a significant role in promoting the work. For instance, initially, the women of Taicang were reluctant to go to the fields to harvest grain because the ground was wet, and the masses feared that women would trample the ground. Therefore, the women's association director, Yang Fuying, was first mobilized to lead six women to harvest 8.5 mu of grain in one day. The news was immediately broadcasted that night. A clapper rhyme was written: "Everyone look at Yang Fuying, a spirited leader of the women, six women go to harvest grain, harvesting eight and a half mu in one day." It was written on the blackboard, and the propagandists took it to various groups to promote. The women in Feng Guozhang's group were contemplating, "Let's go harvest grain tomorrow." Some said, "After we finish harvesting, we will also turn the soil." Furthermore, three women from Ren Liyong's group and Ren Jilian's group said, "Let's go harvest grain tomorrow and see how much we can harvest." The three of them harvested two mu of grain early in the morning. Under such influence, all thirty-eight women in the village went to the fields to harvest grain. Another example is Ren Zhiyong, who got up before dawn to carry three loads of grain and three loads of water, threshed one field, and turned eight fen of land in one day. This was immediately turned into a clapper rhyme and broadcasted at night, and the clapper rhyme was written on the blackboard. Feng Guozhang's group saw it and discussed it, and the whole group got up before dawn, getting up three times very early. Yang Xiaodong saw it and discussed getting up before dawn. The group members said: Can we get on the blackboard? The group leader said yes, getting up before dawn can get you on the blackboard, and they got up twice very early. Under such influence, all the groups in the village got up before dawn. Originally, the plan was for each person to turn three fen of land per day, and each animal-drawn plow to plow two mu, which would take the whole village fifteen days to complete. After getting up before dawn, each person could turn five fen of land per day, and each animal-drawn plow plowed three mu, and the whole village completed the autumn harvest work in eleven days. Furthermore, in Taizhuang, attention was first paid to seed selection in the fields during the autumn harvest. Yao Zhiqian, a local artist, was first asked to write a clapper rhyme for seed selection, and four students from the small people's school were asked to memorize it and promote it in the market and in the fields. After the cadres took the lead in special seed selection and propaganda and mobilization, a total of fifty-five households in the village selected fifty-seven grain spikes, enough for the village's 454 mu of land, and the entire grain seed for next year will be replaced with good seeds. In the propaganda of Hezhang Village, the class line was clear, with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, and all work was completed through the poor and hired peasants, so the grain harvesting, which was originally planned for five days, was completed in three days. On the other hand, in Wenhe Village, the class line was not clear in the propaganda work, and praise was given easily. Two landlord women were praised, and the masses were dissatisfied, with some saying: "Landlord women have also become activists." This not only failed to encourage the masses' production enthusiasm but also damaged the masses' emotions.

　　During this autumn harvest, all villages combined it with current affairs propaganda. The propaganda methods included yangko dance, square plays, maps, clapper rhymes, songs, and oral propaganda. Some used large meetings, and some used markets and mutual aid groups. The masses listened to the news of the Great Counteroffensive victory, which encouraged the masses' production enthusiasm. For example, students from Baiqian High School carried lanterns, danced the yangko, and sang the Great Counteroffensive songs. After singing a section, the propagandists combined it with the victory news in the newspaper and explained it in detail. In between, gongs and drums were played to promote it deeply in mutual aid. The masses were very willing to listen. This propaganda and mobilization work has the following experiences: (1) Mass propaganda should be carried out. For example, villages like Taicang and Taizhuang increased their number of propagandists. According to statistics from ten villages, a total of sixteen clapper rhymes and three songs were compiled, most of which were compiled by the masses themselves. In Taicang, two propagandists controlled one blackboard and used a question-and-answer format to inspire the masses to look at the blackboard. (2) Propaganda work should follow the movement to identify key points, put forward slogans, or compile them into clapper rhymes to promote the work. For example, Taicang mobilized women, broke through individuals, and promoted the whole group and the whole village. When applying fertilizer, some of the masses planned not to apply fertilizer to the ground this winter and save it for spreading in the spring. Therefore, the slogan was put forward: "Rather save old grain than save old manure," to promote timely fertilizer application throughout the village. (3) Propaganda work must be linked to organizational work. For example, Taizhuang first compiled clapper rhymes for field seed selection for propaganda and then organized special personnel for seed selection. (4) The scope of propaganda and praise should be broad, and do not focus on a few individuals or groups. For example, Taicang had a wide scope and also identified key points, which had a great effect. In addition, the radio broadcasting in Shiti Village was too narrow, only promoting Ren Guihua and five other people, and as a result, the masses were not convinced, and those who were praised also felt dishonorable and secretly erased their names from the blackboard. (5) There must be a clear class line, and do not praise randomly. Poor and hired peasants should be mobilized and praised, and do not praise landlords, which will cause dissatisfaction among the masses. (Zhi Dong, You He, Yu Sheng, Zhu Yu, Dong Cheng, Ying Wu)

　　涉县七区收耕运动中的宣传鼓动工作
    涉县七区教员，于十月一号放假后，由区统一领导，配合区村干部，帮助收耕工作。在收耕运动中，各个教员同志和区村干部研究，整顿宣传组织机构，进行群众性的宣传。如太仓、台庄等村，都增加了宣传员。在这次收耕运动中，宣传鼓动起到很大推动作用。如太仓妇女起初不上地割谷，因地湿群众思想上怕妇女到地里踏地，乃首先动员通妇女会主任杨甫英带领六个妇女一天割谷八亩半，黑夜马上广播。并编写快板：“大家看杨甫英，领导妇女有精神，六个妇女去割谷，一天割谷八亩零。”写在黑板上，宣传员拿上到各组宣传。冯国章组的妇女酝酿“咱明天也要去割谷啦。”有的说“咱割完谷，还要去翻地哩。”又如任立用组、任记连等三个妇女说：“咱明天也要去割谷哩，看到底能割多少。”三人一清早，割谷二亩。在这样影响下，全村三十八个妇女都上地割谷。又如任之用起五更担了三担谷，又担了三担水，碾了一个场，一天翻了八分地。马上又编成快板黑夜广播，并把快板写在黑板上。冯国章组看了讨论全组起五更，一连起了三个大五更。杨小东看了讨论起五更，组员们说：咱能上黑板不能？组长说能，起五更就能上黑板，一连起了两次五更。在这样影响下，全村各组都起五更。原计划每人翻地一天翻三分，犁地每犋牲口犁二亩，全村得十五天完成，经过起五更每人一天能翻地五分，牲口一犋犁三亩，全村收耕工作十一天就完成了。又如台庄在收耕当中首先注意到田间选种，先叫板人姚治全编了一个选种快板，用四个小民校学生念会，到饭市上和田地里宣传。经过干部带头专人选种和宣传鼓动，全村共五十五户选种五十七个谷个，够全村四百五十四亩地耩，明年谷种整个都换成好种了。合漳村宣传中阶级路线明确，都是以贫雇为骨干，一切工作都是通过贫雇去完成，所以割谷原计划五天，三天就完成了。另外温和村在宣传工作中阶级路线不明确，轻易表扬，表扬过两个地主妇女，群众不满意，有的说：“人家地主妇女也成了积极分子。”这样不但没鼓舞了群众生产情绪，相反的损害了群众情绪。
    在这次收耕当中，各村都结合了时事宣传，宣传方式有秧歌、广场剧、地图、快板、歌曲、口头宣传等，有的利用大会，有的利用饭市、互助组等，群众听了大反攻胜利消息，鼓舞了群众生产情绪。如白芟高校学生提着灯笼扭着秧歌唱着大反攻歌子，唱一段宣传员结合报纸上胜利消息，详细解释一段，中间打上锣鼓，深入互助宣传，群众很愿意听。这次宣传鼓动工作，有以下几点经验：（一）要开展群众性的宣传。如这次太仓、台庄等村，增加了宣传员，据十个村统计，共编有十六个快板，三个歌子，大部是群众自己编的。太仓由两个宣传员掌握一个黑板，用问答式启发群众看黑板。（二）宣传工作要随着运动找出重点，提出口号，或编成快板去推动工作。如太仓发动妇女、突破个别，推动全组全村。上粪时，群众有的打算今冬不往地上粪，留着明春撒＠，以是提出口号：“宁攒陈粮不攒陈粪，推动全村及时上粪。（三）宣传工作必须和组织工作连系起来。如台庄田间选种，先编出快板进行宣传，然后又组织专人选种。（四）宣传表扬面要广，不要盯住几个人或几个组。如太仓面宽，还找出重点，效果大。另外如石梯文广播面太窄，只宣传任桂花等五个人，结果群众不服气，表扬的人也觉着不光荣，自己偷把黑板上表扬自己的名字擦了。（五）要有明确的阶级路线不要乱表扬。要发动贫雇，表扬贫雇，不要表扬了地主，遭到群众不满。（之栋、友鹤、玉生、珠玉、东成、英武）
