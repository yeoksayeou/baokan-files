The Taiyue Fourth District Committee held an expanded cadre meeting in early September to inspect the land reform situation in various localities and prepare for a major review after the autumn harvest. After ten days of discussion and research at the meeting, many problems were discovered in villages that were previously thought to be "almost there." Wang Yizhi, the secretary of the District Committee, pointed out in his summary that there is currently a serious "Three Not Thorough" phenomenon: (1) The mobilization of the masses is not thorough. In the past, many places in this area did not pay attention to mobilizing hired and poor laborers, and carried out peaceful land dedication and simple land distribution without following the mass line. As a result, the masses expressed indifference to land reform, their awareness failed to improve, and they even became "air raid shelters" for landlords. For example, in Dashe Village, Jiyuan, some people preserved more than 2,000 pieces of clothing and furniture for landlords; in Gaocun Village, Jincheng, some people preserved 426 yuan in silver, four gold rings, twenty-eight packages, and three dan of grain for landlords. At the same time, some backward cadres are still hindering the mass movement. For example, Cheng Songlin, chairman of the peasant association in Liuzhang Village, Yuanqu, when struggling against landlord Zhao Anpu, the masses asked for good land to be distributed, but he said: "People have not worked, five people must leave twenty acres of good land, people hire a farmhand also must leave five acres of farmhand land," the masses asked to distribute Zhao Anpu's south house, he said: "The south house has two beds, people often have guests coming and going just right." In Nancun Village, Jincheng, when a landlord wanted to marry a wife, the village chief and chairman of the peasant association were busy taking charge of the matter. The masses said: "Isn't it still the landlord who has influence?" In addition, women in many villages have not been mobilized. For example, in Gao Le Town, Yuanqu, a bunch of old women came to attend the women's meeting to deal with official business. (2) The elimination of feudalism is not thorough. In many villages, landlords have not yielded to the peasants in politics and economy. For example, a teacher in Yinya River, Jiyuan, is a landlord and openly spreads anti-communist and anti-people propaganda; landlord Wang Huadong in Linjian used his ability to write and calculate to become a land measuring committee member, deliberately measuring more land for the emancipated peasants and increasing the output. When someone asked him why he did this, he said: "The land that was obtained without paying money should be measured more!" The three landlord families of Shangguan Jia Rang, Zhang Guo Tai, and Hou Jun Li in Nanguan Village had more than two hundred rooms and four hundred acres of land that were not touched at all. (3) The distribution of fruits of victory is not thorough. To this day, some villages have not distributed the fruits of victory, keeping them as production funds. Some rich villages have turned over, but poor villages are still poor. Generally, cadres get more fruits of victory, and cheap purchases of fruits of victory have not been thoroughly resolved. Secondly, it was pointed out that these three kinds of incomplete phenomena are divided into several types of villages: The first type is villages where land reform is relatively thorough, such as Kangneng Village in Jincheng and Yanxiao Village in Yangcheng. The masses have a relatively high level of awareness, and production and participation in the war are done well. The second type is half-cooked villages. This type of village accounts for the majority in the entire district. Some poor hired laborers have not been emancipated, their suffering has not been thoroughly expressed, and landlords still retain a considerable amount of internal property. The problems of military cadres and revolutionary martyrs' families have not been resolved, and the leadership of the village administration is in the hands of middle peasants. The third type is villages where only a layer of skin has been scraped off in the great movement. Landlords still retain most of their property, most of the extremely poor and poor peasants have not been emancipated, and there are many phenomena such as simple land distribution and false struggles. Village political power is directly or indirectly controlled by landlords and feudal rich peasants. The fourth type is blank villages that have not been touched at all. These villages are mostly remote mountain gullies and large villages and towns with strong feudal forces, such as Chengguan, Liushudi, and Dayang Villages in Jincheng. Finally, Comrade Wang Yizhi called for a thorough solution to these problems. First, launch a class investigation and ideological investigation movement, combining the investigation of families, the investigation of sheltering, the investigation of fruits of victory, the investigation of work, the investigation of stance, and the investigation of ideology. Jincheng proposed "three publicizations": "Publicization of fruits of victory, publicization of property, publicization of components," which has been very effective. At the same time, it is also necessary to promote democracy from the bottom up, promote ideological awareness, and then mobilize poor hired laborers, take the poor hired laborer line, and thoroughly eliminate feudalism.

　　发现三不彻底号召面向贫雇
  　太岳四地委检查土改准备大复查
    【本报太岳三十日电】四地委于九月初召开扩干会议，检查各地土改情形，准备秋后大复查。经过十天会议的讨论与研究，过去以为“差不多”的村庄，此次发现了不少问题。地委书记王毅之总结中首先指出：目前存在着严重的三不彻底现象：（一）发动群众不彻底，过去本区不少地方，不注意发动雇贫，不走群众路线的进行了和平献出，单纯分田。因此群众对土地改革表示冷淡，觉悟未能提高，甚至给地主当了“防空洞”。如济源大社村有一部分群众给地主保存衣物家具竟达两千余件；晋城高村一部分群众给地主保存现洋四百廿六元，金戒指四个，包袱二十八个，粮食三石。同时仍有部分落后干部阻碍着群众运动，如垣曲刘张村农会主席成松林，当斗争地主赵安普时，群众要求分好地，他却说：“人家没有劳动过，五口人得留二十亩好地，人家请个长工还得留五亩长工地”，群众要求分赵安普的南房，他说：“南房有两个床，人家经常有客人来往正好。”晋城南村地主要娶媳妇，村长农会主席便给人家忙着主事，群众说：“还不是地主吃得开”。此外许多村庄的妇女仍未发动起来，如垣曲皋乐镇，召集妇女会，却来了一堆老太婆应付公事。（二）消灭封建不彻底，许多村庄地主在政治经济上都未向农民屈服，如济源尹压河一教员，系地主，公开宣传反共反人民；林涧地主王化东借其能写会算当了丈地委员，故意将翻身农民的土地丈得多，产量提高，有人问他为什么要这样，他说：“没出钱弄来的地就该重些！”南官庄上官家让、张国太、侯俊理三家地主，二百余间房子，四百余亩土地根本未动。（三）果实分配不彻底，至今有些村庄果实仍未分配，留作生产基金，有些富村翻了身，穷村仍是穷，普遍的干部多得果实，贱买果实均未彻底解决。其次指出这三种不彻底的现象，分为几种类型村庄：第一种是土地改革比较彻底的村子。如晋城的康能村，阳城的岩小村，群众的觉悟比较高，生产参战作得好；第二种半生不熟的村子。这类的村子在全区占多数，部分贫雇未翻身，苦未诉透，地主还保存相当数量的内产，军干、烈属问题未解决，村政领导权掌握在中农手中；第三种是大运动中，只削过一层皮，地主还保存着大部财产，赤贫、贫农大部未翻身，单纯分田，假斗争等现象很多，村政权直接或间接掌握在地主与封建富农手中；第四种是空白村，原封未动，这类村庄多系偏僻山沟，与封建势力雄厚的大村镇，如晋城城关，柳树底、大阳等村皆是。最后王毅之同志号召要彻底解决这些问题，首先展开查阶级、查思想运动，将查家庭、查包庇、查果实、查工作、查立场、查思想结合起来，晋城提出三公开：“果实公开、财产公开、成份公开”，生效很大。同时并要自下而上的发扬民主，促成思想自觉，其次发动贫雇，走贫雇路线，实现贫雇领导，彻底消灭封建。
