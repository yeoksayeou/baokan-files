　　Northwest Democratic Allied Army's Sixth Cavalry Division Greatly Increases Fighting Strength in the Past Year
　　Will Fight to the End for the Liberation of Northwest China
Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th. Reporter Qiao Qian reports: October marks the anniversary of the glorious uprising of the Sixth Cavalry Division of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army in Hengshan. This reporter specially visited General Hu Jingduo, commander of the division, who had just returned from the front lines of the Jian (Ning) Mi (Zhi) battle. General Hu happily told the reporter: "This victory has opened up a new situation in the Northwest battlefield, and the self-defense war in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has entered a counter-offensive stage. All officers and soldiers of our division are extremely happy to dedicate themselves to the cause of the people at this time." He continued: "Since our unit's uprising in Hengshan on October 13th last year, we have received great care and love from the military and civilians in the liberated areas during the reorganization period. The appearance of the troops has been greatly changed in the past year. Because the troops have established revolutionary political work and its complete set of institutions, and carried out ideological education to serve the people, the troops have initially achieved cooperation between the army and the people, and unity between officers and soldiers. This has overcome all the bad habits of the old army and laid the foundation for a people's army that consciously fights for the interests of the people. Due to the improvement of the troops' quality, the morale has also risen unprecedentedly. Since the bandit Chiang Hu invaded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, our unit has cooperated with the Northwest People's Liberation Army, fighting in Longdong, Guanzhong and other places, and participated in the summer offensive campaign in Longzhong. In the battle to liberate Xunyi, we captured the county town and important strongholds such as Taibaozi and Taiyu Town in one fell swoop, capturing more than 100 Chiang bandits, including the county magistrate. At a time when the Southern Front Liberation Army is launching a full-scale offensive and the national situation is entering a new stage, all officers and soldiers of the division are extremely excited and vow to fight to the end to complete the glorious mission of liberating Northwest China." At this point, General Hu said humorously: "Hu Zongnan has been constantly spreading rumors, falsely claiming that the Sixth Cavalry Division has been 'eliminated', but the fact is relentless, it is not us who are eliminated but Chiang Hu's bandit army itself!"

　　西北民主联军骑六师一年来战斗力量大增
  　将为解放大西北而战斗到底
    【新华社西北三十日电】分社记者乔迁报导：十月为西北民主联军骑六师横山光荣举义周年纪念，记者特往访甫自检（林）米（脂）战役前线归来的该师师长胡景铎将军，胡将军欣喜的语记者称：“此次胜利开辟了西北战场的新局面，陕甘宁边区的自卫战争从此进入了反攻。我师得于此时献身人民事业，全体官兵欢庆莫名。”继谓：“我部自去年十月十三日横山起义以来，整训期间备受解放区军民关怀爱护，一年来部队面目大改旧观。部队因建立了革命的政治工作及其整套机构，进行了为人民服务的思想教育，已使部队初步做到军民合作，官兵一致。从而克服了旧军队的一切恶习，奠定了为人民利益而自觉作战的人民军队的基础。由于部队素质的提高，士气亦随之空前高涨。自蒋胡匪进犯陕甘宁边区以来，我部与西北人民解放军并肩合作，转战陇东、关中等地，参与了陇中夏季出击战役。在解放旬邑之战，一举攻克县城及太堡子、太裕镇等重要据点，生擒蒋贼县长以下一百余人。当此南线解放军全线出击，全国形势进入新阶段之际，全师官兵激奋异常，誓为完成解放大西北的光荣使命而战斗到底。”至此，胡将军幽默地说：“胡宗南曾不断造谣。诬称骑六师已被‘消灭’，不过事实毫不留情，被消灭的不是我们而是蒋胡匪军自己！”
