　　The European Situation
    The British Prime Minister Attlee's cry of "the seriousness of the national economic crisis" on August 11th was declared to have occurred in Britain. The economic crisis in Britain, like that of other Western European countries, is not a crisis of overproduction, but a crisis of underproduction. Since the end of the war, Britain has felt a shortage of food, coal, clothing, housing, transportation, and foreign exchange. There are more imports than exports. It has barely managed to maintain itself by borrowing a batch of US dollars. Now that this batch of US dollars is about to run out, all the shortages have suddenly become apparent, threatening the people of Britain and becoming a crisis. This crisis has become widespread in most European countries. In France and Italy, the economic crisis is more serious than in Britain, and has formed a political crisis. In Greece, in addition to the economic and political crisis, there is also a military crisis. In addition, countries such as Turkey and the Netherlands are facing an imminent crisis. While the people's lives are rising in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the living standards of the people in Western European countries are rapidly declining. Britain has fallen to the wartime living standard, France has fallen to the lowest wartime living standard, and a new food panic is looming.

    The rapid development of the crisis was unexpected for the authorities of Western European countries. They once thought that US dollar loans could solve all the difficulties, but the result was, as Attlee said, encountering "a large number of unprecedented factors" and falling into a crisis. The British government, at the cost of severing some economic sovereignty and politically following the United States in opposing the Soviet Union, borrowed 3.75 billion US dollars from the United States last July, thinking it could last until the end of 1950, but the result was that it was difficult to survive even the end of this year. The French government, at the cost of ousting Communist Party members, exchanged 250 million US dollars in loans in May, but the result was that the economic situation in France deteriorated even more, and the financial deficit that could not be made up increased from 400 million US dollars per year (Finance Minister Schumann's talk on May 23) to 100 million US dollars per month (Foreign Minister Bidault's talk on September 29). Food rations were reduced to six taels of bread per person per day, and threatened to be reduced to five taels or four taels, causing widespread strikes and riots. Italy is similar to France. In May, a Christian Democratic Party government supported by US imperialism was established, ousting Communist and Socialist Party members, and seeking some "relief" from the United States. Recently, there was a major strike of 1.6 million rural workers, and left-wing parties and the people demanded the replacement of the government. Greece and Turkey obtained 400 million loans approved by the US Congress in the name of the "Truman Doctrine" this May, of which 300 million were given to the Greek reactionary government as military and economic assistance for attacking the people's guerrillas; 100 million were given to Turkey as military assistance for anti-Soviet purposes. The exchange condition was the "supervision" of the United States over these two countries, making the governments of these two countries practically puppet governments of the United States. But only three months later, in August this year, the Greek people's guerrillas launched a major counter-offensive, and Turkey was already facing an economic crisis due to the burden of military spending and the bankruptcy of national industries.

    The lack of crisis in Eastern Europe was even more unexpected for US imperialists. According to the original estimates of the US reactionaries, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, after the destruction of the war, could hardly rebuild their economies without US aid. Therefore, US imperialists attempted to use gold as a political weapon and unscrupulously expand not only to Western Europe but also to Eastern Europe. This March, US reactionaries flaunted the "Truman Doctrine," boasting that they were prepared to "aid" various countries with 15 billion to 20 billion US dollars to "eliminate communism." In June of this year, they fabricated the so-called "Marshall Plan," saying that the United States would use huge loans to "help Europe recover." US imperialists bragged twice, and the reactionaries of Britain and France echoed, pretending to be impressive for a while. However, not only did the temptation of US imperialism fail to take effect in Eastern Europe, but also US imperialism's money could not save the crisis in Western Europe. The sixteen-nation Paris conference just opened a bill for 22.44 billion US dollars, and the crisis has spread throughout Western Europe. Truman, Marshall, and others have proposed to provide so-called "temporary emergency assistance" to Western European countries. Truman, Marshall, and Vandenberg are no longer as boastful as they were in March and June. Truman's speech on September 29 revealed embarrassment. He complained that apart from the funds remaining from the 342.2 million relief funds approved by Congress, there were no other funds. He demanded another 580 million to maintain France, Italy and Austria "this winter." The absence of crisis in Eastern Europe and the severity of the crisis in Western Europe were obviously unforeseen by Truman, Marshall and others.

    The facts show that money cannot solve any problems. Solving problems depends on the power of the people and correct policies. Eastern European countries did not receive "aid" from the United States, but because their policies were correct, they were able to overcome difficulties and smoothly carry out reconstruction work. Because the ruling power in Eastern European countries is the democratic force including the Communist Party, they implement democracy politically, severely suppress the remnants of fascism and traitors, implement land reform and state ownership of banks and large industries economically, improve the lives of workers, and unite with the socialist Soviet Union externally, establishing equal, mutually beneficial, peaceful and friendly relations with various countries, and resolutely oppose the attempts of US imperialism to undermine its national sovereignty and independence, so they can rely on their own people and the mutual assistance of various countries to solve all problems. The example of Eastern Europe shows that Europe is entirely capable of self-reliance. Because the reactionaries in Western European countries are in power and implement a set of wrong domestic and foreign policies, although they have superficially received "aid," they are actually drinking poison to quench their thirst, which instead makes difficulties develop into crises, or makes crises even deeper. Politically, they oppose the people and the Communist Party, accommodate fascism, and restore the dictatorship of the big bourgeoisie; economically, they oppose the state-owned policy, protect the interests of big capitalists and landlords, and exploit workers and all laborers; militarily, they maintain a huge army, invade colonies, suppress the domestic people, spend unaffordable military expenditures, and waste a lot of manpower that can be used for production. This is the reactionary domestic policy implemented by the governments of Britain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and the Netherlands. Because of the lack of production in Western European countries, these policies are bound to make the lack of production develop into a crisis, or deepen the crisis even more. The reactionary domestic policy and the reactionary foreign policy are inseparable. In terms of foreign policy, the reactionaries of Western European countries are pro-American and anti-Soviet, preferring to sell out their national sovereignty and independence, allowing US imperialism to interfere in their internal affairs, and even becoming puppets of US imperialism, in order to seek "aid" from the United States. The foreign policy of US imperialism is to expand itself. Due to the approaching crisis of its own, this policy is increasingly becoming strictly selfish and strictly for the expansion of the United States. It uses the difficulties of other countries, uses the need for assistance from other countries, and puts forward increasingly harsh conditions, making other countries become appendages of the United States. After the outbreak of the Western European crisis, the conditions for US loans to Britain included "ceding the Ruhr, abolishing the nationalization of the Ruhr industry, and more or less openly suggesting stopping the nationalization of British industry" (Varga), including changing the British tariff system, and even proposing that Americans supervise the use of loans. The conditions for the United States to request new loans to France included "recruiting pre-war politicians (i.e., French traitors) to participate in the French government." The purpose of the so-called "Marshall Plan" is: first, in order to save the impending economic crisis in the United States, to attempt to make the European countries in need of assistance abandon the right to independently handle their own economies, let the United States use Britain and France to interfere in their internal affairs, and make these countries dependent on the interests of US monopolists. Second, to form a so-called Western European group, under the leadership of the United States, to oppose the Soviet Union and the democratic countries of Eastern Europe. Third, to build heavy industry in western Germany and the Ruhr area, and make it an economic base for the expansion of the United States in Europe, even if this violates the national interests of Western European countries and threatens their security. This selfish policy of US imperialism, nominally "aid," actually increases the difficulties tenfold and a hundredfold for those countries that deal with the United States in the reconstruction work, thus promoting the crisis and deepening the crisis. The reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the reactionaries in Western European countries, and the expansionist policy of US imperialism, are the source of the "large number of unprecedented factors" that Attlee said caused the crisis. The fundamental reason why Western European countries that borrowed money have a crisis, and Eastern Europe that did not borrow money does not have a crisis, lies here.

    The development of the European situation in the past six months has further proved that US imperialism is strong in appearance but weak in reality, its habitual trick of making false threats is not terrible, and its hypocrisy is not credible. Under the imperialist policy of the United States, "aid" is to create a crisis, and "relief" is to create a disaster. There are two key points in the European situation in the past six months: one is the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March and April. At this conference, the United States and Britain colluded in an attempt to make the Soviet Union yield on the German and Austrian issues. The Soviet Union exposed this conspiracy with a solemn attitude and adhered to the Yalta and Potsdam agreements, which foiled the attempt of the United States and Britain to undermine the agreements. The other key is the Paris Conference initiated by Britain and France to discuss the so-called "Marshall Plan." The Soviet Union and Eastern European countries also adopted a solemn stance and refused to participate in this "plan" of unknown origin, which resulted in the quick exposure of the so-called "Marshall Plan" fraud. When the reactionaries want to implement division, insisting on the truth and making a solemn struggle will inevitably result in the isolation of the reactionaries. This experience has been had in China, and the changes in Europe have proved it again.

    The crisis in Western Europe marks the failure of the US imperialist reactionary policy of using gold as a political weapon and atomic bombs as a threat to expand to Europe in the first round. The policy of aggression carried out by US imperialism under the mask of "aid," the policy of making countries become US appendages carried out under the smoke screen of "opposing communism," the policy of creating crises in various countries, deepening the crises in various countries, and supporting Germany to endanger the security of various countries carried out under the slogan of "revitalizing Europe" cannot be tolerated not only by the people of Europe, but also by the broad part of the bourgeoisie in Western Europe. The breakdown of the negotiations between Britain and the United States on tariff issues, and the protests of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands against the German policy of Britain and the United States are examples. The result of the reactionary policy of US imperialism in Europe is to promote the crisis in Western Europe, increase the contradictions between the United States and Western European countries, and greatly improve the awareness of the European people. The sharp contrast between Eastern Europe and Western Europe indicates the way out for the suffering people of Western Europe and enhances the courage of the Western European people to struggle.

    In order to avoid the upcoming economic crisis, US imperialist elements are now actively preparing for war. War mongers in the United States, Britain, Greece, and Turkey are making every effort to carry out war propaganda and practical preparations against the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. The people of Europe are now rising up in a more vigorous manner to oppose these war mongers, oppose US imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, and eliminate the danger of war. In this just struggle, a strong, peaceful, democratic united front will be established in Europe. In the future struggle, the situation will be unfavorable to US imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries. It will be favorable to the people. The struggle to put out the danger of war will surely move forward, and the struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs, the reactionaries of various countries, will inevitably rise in Europe and the world, echoing the just wars of independence and liberation carried out by the eastern nations, first of all the people of our country, and jointly move towards victory.

### 欧洲形势

专栏：新华社社论

　　欧洲形势
    八月十一日英首相艾德礼喊出的“国家之严重性经济危机”被宣告在英国发生了。英国的经济危机和西欧其他国家一样，不是生产过剩的危机，而是生产不足的危机。从大战结束以来，英国即感粮食不足，煤炭不足，衣服不足，房屋不足，运输工具不足，外汇不足，输入者多，输出者少，靠着借了一批美金勉强维持，现在这批美金快要用光了，一切不足就骤然表面化，威胁着全英国的人民，成为危机。这种危机已经普遍到欧洲大部分国家。在法国和意大利，经济危机比英国更严重，并且形成了政治危机；在希腊，则在经济的政治的危机之外，还有军事危机；此外，如土耳其、荷兰等国，则是危机紧迫的将要到来。当东欧的新民主主义国家中人民生活正在上升的时候，西欧各国人民的生活水准急剧下降了。英国降到战时的生活水准，法国降到战时的最低生活水准，而且新的粮食恐慌眼看着又要到来。
    危机的发展如此迅速，对于西欧各国的当局是出于意料之外的，他们曾以为美国的金元贷款可以解决一切困难，结果却如艾礼德所说，遇到了“大量前所未见的因素”，陷入危机之中。英国政府以断送若干经济主权和政治上跟着美国反苏为代价，去年七月借得美国三十七亿五千万美元的贷款，以为可以维持到一九五○年年底，结果却连今年年底都难渡过。法国政府以排挤共产党团员为代价，五月间换得二亿五千万美元的贷款，结果是法国的经济情况愈加恶化，财政上无法弥补的亏空，由每年四亿美元（五月二十三日财长苏曼谈话）增至每月一亿美元（九月二十九日外长比道尔谈话），粮食配给减到每人每日六两面包，并且威胁着还要减到五两或四两，引起了广泛的罢工与骚动。意大利也同法国相似，五月间成立了美帝国主义所扶持的基督教民主党政府，排挤了共产党、社会党团员，求得美国的若干“救济”，最近那里却发生了一百六十万农村工人的大罢工，左翼政党和人民要求撤换政府。希腊与土耳其今年五月取得了美国国会在“杜鲁门主义”名义下通过的四亿贷款，其中三亿给予希腊反动政府，作为进攻人民游击队之用的军事与经济援助；一亿给予土耳其，作为反苏之用的军事援助。其交换条件是美国对这两个国家的“监督”，使这两个国家的政府实际上成为美国的傀儡政府。但是仅仅在三个月之后，即今年八月，希腊人民游击队大举反攻，土耳其已因军费负担与民族工业的破产而面临经济的危机。
    东欧的没有危机，对于美国帝国主义者来说，更是出于意料之外。照美国反动派的原来估计，苏联与东欧经过了大战的破坏，没有美国的援助，经济的重建很少可能。因此，美国帝国主义者企图以金元为政治武器，肆无忌惮，不但向西欧扩张，而且向东欧扩张。今年三月，美国反动派标榜“杜鲁门主义”，夸口说准备以一百五十亿到二百亿美元“援助”各国来“消灭共产主义”。今年六月又虚构所谓“马歇尔计划”，说美国将以巨量贷款“帮助欧洲复兴”。美国帝国主义者吹了两次大牛皮，加上英法等反动派的随声附和，一时装得有声有色。然而，不但美国帝国主义的诱惑在东欧没有生效，而且美国帝国主义的金元也救不了西欧的危机。十六国巴黎会议刚才开出了二百二十四亿四千万美元的帐单子，而危机已经普及全西欧。杜鲁门、马歇尔辈又提出要对西欧各国进行所谓“临时紧急援助”。杜鲁门、马歇尔、范登堡之流现在再不象三月和六月间那样夸口了，杜鲁门九月二十九日的演说显出了窘态。他诉苦说：除了国会所通过的三亿四千二百万元救济金所剩下的款项外，再没有其他任何款项了。他要求再有五亿八千万元，以便在“今冬”维持法、意、奥三国。东欧没有危机，西欧的危机如此严重，这些显然都是杜鲁门、马歇尔之流所没有预见到的。
    事实所显示的是金元并不能解决什么问题，解决问题要靠人民的力量，要靠正确的政策。东欧诸国没有得到美国的“援助”，但因为政策正确，均能克服困难，顺利进行复兴工作。东欧诸国由于执掌政权的是包括共产党在内的民主力量，在政治上实行民主，严厉镇压法西斯残余与卖国贼，在经济上实行土地改革和银行大工业的国有，改善劳动者的生活，对外联合社会主义的苏联，与各国建立平等互助的和平友好关系，坚决反对美国帝国主义企图损害其国家主权与独立的尝试，于是就能依靠自己的人民和各国的互助，解决一切问题。东欧的例子说明欧洲是完全可能自力更生的。西欧各国由于反动派掌政，执行了一套错误的对内对外政策，所以虽然表面上得到了“援助”，实际上是饮鸩止渴，反而使困难发展成为危机，或使危机更加加深，在政治上反对人民、反对共产党，优容法西斯，恢复大资产阶级专政；在经济上反对国有政策，保护大资本家大地主的利益，榨取工人和一切劳动者；在军事上保持庞大的军队，侵略殖民地，镇压国内人民，支出不能负担的军费，耗费可以用于生产的大量人力，这就是英、法、意、希、土、荷兰等政府所执行的反动的对内政策。由于西欧各国在经济上生产不足，这些政策就势必使生产不足发展成为危机，或者把危机更加加深。反动的对内政策与反动的对外政策是不可分离的。在对外政策上，西欧各国的反动派亲美反苏，宁愿出卖国家的主权与独立，让美帝国主义干涉内政，甚至变成美帝国主义的傀儡，来求得美国的“援助”。美国帝国主义的对外政策就是扩张自己。由于自身危机的迫近，这个政策日益变成严格的自私自利，严格的为了美国的扩张。它利用别国的困难，利用别国的需要援助，提出日益苛刻的条件，使别国变成美国的附庸。此次西欧危机发生后，美国对于英国贷款条件包括“割让鲁尔，取消鲁尔工业国有化，和或多或少公开建议停止英国工业国有化”（瓦尔加），包括改变英国关税制度，甚至提出由美国人监督借款的用途。美国对于法国要求新贷款的条件，包括“网罗战前政治家（即法奸）参加法国政府”。所谓“马歇尔计划”其目的就是：第一，为了挽救美国即将到来的经济危机，企图使欧洲需要援助的各国放弃独立自主处理本国经济之权，让美国利用英、法干涉它们的内政，使这些国家都依附于美国独占家的利益。第二，组成所谓西欧集团，在美国领导之下，来反对苏联及东欧各民主国家。第三，建设德国西部及鲁尔区的重工业，把它作为美国在欧洲扩张的经济基地，即使这件事违反西欧各国的民族利益和威胁他们的安全，也在所不顾。美国帝国主义的这种自私自利的政策，名为“援助”，实际上是使那些与美国打交道的国家在复兴工作中增加十倍百倍的困难，因而促成危机，加深危机。西欧各国反动派的对内对外的反动政策，和美国帝国主义的扩张主义政策，就是艾德礼所说的造成危机的“大量前所未见的因素”的来源。借到了金元的西欧各国发生危机，没有借到金元的东欧反而没有危机，基本原因就在这里。
    欧洲形势最近半年来的发展，更加证明了美国帝国主义是外强中干的，它的虚声恫吓的惯技是不足怕的，它的假冒为善，是不足信的。在美国的帝国主义政策下，“援助”就是造成危机，“救济”就是造成灾难。半年来欧洲时局的关键有两个：一个是三四月间的莫斯科外长会议，在这个会议上，美国和英国勾结起来，企图使苏联在德、奥问题上屈服，苏联以严正的态度揭露了这个阴谋，坚持了雅尔塔、波茨顿协定，使美国和英国破坏协定的企图失败了。另一个关键是英、法发起的讨论所谓“马歇尔计划”的巴黎会议。苏联和东欧诸国又采取了严正的立场，对于这个来历不明的“计划”拒绝参加，结果使所谓“马歇尔计划”的骗局很快就被揭穿。当反动派要实行分裂的时候，坚持真理作严正的斗争，结果必然是反动派被孤立起来，这种经验在中国有过，欧洲的事变又证明了它。
    西欧的危机，标志着美国帝国主义以金元为政治武器，并以原子弹为威胁，向欧洲扩张的反动政策，已经在第一个回合中遭到了失败。美国帝国主义在“援助”的面具下进行的侵略政策，在“反对共产主义”的烟幕之下进行的使各国变为美国附庸的政策，在“复兴欧洲”的口号之下进行的造成各国危机，加深各国危机并扶植德国危害各国安全的政策，不但欧洲人民不能忍受，而且连西欧资产阶级的广大部分也不能接受。英、美关于关税问题谈判的破裂，法、比、荷对于英、美对德政策的抗议，都是例子。美国帝国主义在欧洲的反动政策的结果，是促成西欧的危机，增长了美国与西欧各国的矛盾，并使欧洲人民的觉悟程度大大提高。东欧与西欧的鲜明对比，给苦难中的西欧人民指示了出路，并提高了西欧人民斗争的勇气。
    美帝国主义分子为了避免即将到来的经济危机，现在积极准备战争，美、英、希、土等国的战争贩子正在竭力进行反对苏联及东欧各国的战争宣传及实际准备。欧洲人民现在正以更加雄健的姿态起来反对这些战争贩子，反对美国帝国主义和各国反动派，消灭战争的危险。在这个正义的斗争中，强有力的和平民主的统一战线，将在欧洲建立起来。在今后的斗争中，形势对于美国帝国主义和各国反动派将是不利的。对于人民则是有利的。扑灭战争危险的斗争必将向前发展，反对美国帝国主义及其走狗各国反动派的斗争，必然会在欧洲及全世界高涨起来，与东方各民族首先是我国人民所进行的独立解放的正义战争互相呼应，共同走向胜利。
