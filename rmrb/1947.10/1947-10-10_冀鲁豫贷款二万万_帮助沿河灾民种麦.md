[Our Newspaper Jiluyu Eighth Dispatch] The Jiluyu Relief Committee Office, in order to understand the living conditions of the masses affected by the Yellow River, specially sent people to the disaster areas for investigation. According to the materials obtained, in the eight counties of Hexi, Dong'e, Shouzhang, Fanxian, Puxian, Kunshan, Quhe (newly established county, part of the old Changyuan), and Yunbei alone, there are 185,541 affected residents, and 3,225.097 hectares of land were flooded. These disaster victims have only harvested a small amount of sorghum this year, and less than one-tenth of them can maintain their lives until the end of the year. In order to solve the living problems of the flooded victims, the Administrative Office has allocated 200 million yuan for wheat planting loans, and called on the victims to establish production and transportation cooperatives, and actively engage in various productions.

[Our Newspaper Jiluyu Eighth Dispatch] The Fanxian Democratic Government has allocated 10 million yuan to loan to the riverbed victims for wheat planting. In the third district of the county, there are more than 50 riverbed villages, most of which were flooded during the major floods. In the second district alone, 34 villages were flooded, with a total of 42,800 mu of land flooded and more than 4,000 houses collapsed, affecting more than 13,400 people. Villages such as Cuizhuang, Luzhuang, and Muzhuang were completely submerged in the water. It was expected that the autumn grain would be harvested in abundance this year, but unexpectedly, the floods came and all were submerged, and it is estimated that the second district alone will reduce the autumn grain harvest by at least 21,400 shi. Now that the major floods are about to pass and the wheat planting season has passed, the county's democratic government sympathizes with the difficulties of the victims who have lost their autumn grain and have no wheat seeds, and has allocated 10 million yuan in loans to help the local victims purchase wheat seeds in order to rush to plant wheat. Currently, cadres in various districts are wading through the several-foot-deep mud after the major floods to conduct on-site investigations of the disaster situation and distribute loans.

[Our Newspaper Taiyue Eighth Dispatch] When Qinyuan farmers were planting wheat and lacking livestock, the Qinyuan branch of the Jinnan Bank specially allocated 4.26 million yuan to buy 121 heads of livestock. Qinyuan persevered in the struggle during the Anti-Japanese War and suffered severe damage from the Japanese invaders. The democratic government helped to solve difficulties everywhere, but manpower and animal power could not be restored immediately. This time, the Qinyuan branch of the Jinnan Bank loaned 4.26 million yuan, and immediately purchased 69 heads of cattle, 29 donkeys, and 13 mules, a total of 121 heads, at the Chengguan and Guodao fairs, and distributed them to 121 poor farmers without livestock to use.

[Our Newspaper Pingshun News] In order to fully serve production and overcome the famine, the branch decided to allocate 5 million yuan in production and famine relief loans to Pingshun. The branch also extracted 3 million yuan from the branch's production funds based on the local disaster situation in Pingshun, and cooperated with the county party committee and county government to study and distribute the funds to various districts with a focus on the disaster situation. For example, the third district, which was the most severely affected (about 40-50% harvest), was allocated 2.8 million yuan. In terms of loan methods, a uniform interest rate of five percent was applied, and the loans were distributed through credit cooperatives and more established cooperatives, which can promote the further development of credit business. On the other hand, due to the long distance, if all the affected villages came to the county for loans, it would waste a lot of manpower. According to the statistics of the villages in each district that have loans, there are a total of 56 villages. For example, in Wangjiazhuang and other villages in the third district, it would take two and a half workdays to travel to the county and back, while borrowing through the credit cooperative would only take half a workday. The procedures are simplified as much as possible to meet the needs of the masses. The district distributes the amount to each village, and the affected households report to the people's school, and after being approved by the masses, they elect a person in charge to borrow from the designated credit cooperative. It is guaranteed to be distributed to the liberated peasants for production. (Xiangrong, Baoxian)

　　冀鲁豫贷款二万万
  　帮助沿河灾民种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】冀鲁豫救济委员会办事处，为了解黄河沿岸受灾群众之生活情形，特派专人赴灾区调查，根据所得材料，仅河西、东阿、寿张、范县、濮县、昆山、曲河（新设县，旧长垣一部）、郓北等八县，受灾居民即达十八万五千五百四十一人，被淹土地三千二百二十五顷零九十七亩，这些灾民今年仅收到很少一点高粱，生活能维持到年底的还不足十分之一，为解决被淹灾民的生活问题，行署特拨款二万万元作种麦贷款，并号召灾民成立生产运输等合作社，积极从事各种生产。
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】范县民主政府拨款一千万元，贷与河床灾民种麦。该县三区共有河床村五十余，大泛期中大部被淹于水中，仅二区被淹之村庄即达三十四个，计淹地四万二千八百亩，淹倒房屋四千余间，灾民达一万三千四百余人，其中崔庄，芦庄及穆庄等村，则完全塌没于水中，今年秋粮满望丰收，不料大泛至，均被淹没，估计二区最少减收秋粮二万一千四百石。现大泛即将过去，种麦季节已过，该县民主政府体念灾民秋粮失收又无麦种之困难，特拨贷款一千万元，帮助该地灾民购买麦种，以便抢种麦子。现各区干部正跋涉于大泛后数尺深的泥水中，实地进行调查灾情分发贷款。
    【本报太岳八日电】沁源农民正在种麦缺乏牲口时，冀南银行沁源支行特拨给贷款四百二十六万元，买上牲口一百二十一头。沁源在抗战中艰苦坚持斗争，受到日寇严重的摧残，民主政府处处帮助解决困难，但人力、畜力仍未能立即恢复，此次冀南银行沁源支行即贷予款四百二十六万，当即在城关、郭道两个集会上，购得耕牛六十九头、毛驴二十九头、骡子十三头共一百二十一头，分给一百二十一个无牲口的贫苦农民使用。
    【本报平顺讯】在全力服务生产渡荒下，分行决定给平顺拨生产渡荒贷款五百万元，支行更根据平顺当地灾情，又从支行生产资金内抽出三百万元，并和县委县府协同研究，根据灾情有重点的分发各区。如三区最严重（约四五成收）就分配了二百八十万元。在贷款方法上，统一利息五厘，通过信用社部，及较有基础的合作社发放，这样可促进信用业务更加开展，另一方面由于路途较远，如果受灾的村都来县贷的话，就浪费很多民力。据各区分配有贷款的村统计共五十六个，如三区王家庄等村来县一次往返就得两个半工，通过信用社贷，往返只用半个工就行。在手续上力求简便合乎群众要求，经区把数目分配各村，让受灾户在民校报，由群众批准后，推一负责人到指定的信用社合作社去贷。回来保证分到翻身农民手中，以便进行生产。（祥荣、宝贤）
