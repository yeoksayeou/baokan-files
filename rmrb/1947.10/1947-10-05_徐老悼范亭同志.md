Xu Lao Mourns Comrade Fan Ting

The old Chinese educator Comrade Xu Teli, upon hearing the sad news of Comrade Xu Fanting's death, specially wrote an article of mourning. The original text is as follows:

　　Since joining the Tongmenghui, Comrade Xu Fanting participated in the anti-Manchu, anti-Yuan, and anti-Cao Wu battles. All the way to the War of Resistance Against Japan, the revolution deepened time and time again, and his revolutionary spirit and revolutionary struggle became more active and tenacious. In recent years, he was bedridden and unable to move, but when the situation reached a critical juncture, he still strove to publish revolutionary remarks. As the saying goes, "the older one gets, the more pungent; the older one gets, the younger one becomes," Comrade Fanting was such a person. Lu Xun and Tao Xingzhi dedicated their lives to the country and the people. At every critical moment of the revolution, especially when the revolution temporarily failed, many revolutionary partners wavered, fell behind, and betrayed, but they became more determined and braver, persisting until their last breath. We respect them, love them, and call them non-Party Bolsheviks. Comrades Zou Taofen and Xu Fanting persevered in their revolutionary struggle until their last breath, and even requested to join our Party to express their posthumous hopes. From the national liberation of democracy to the human liberation of communism, they were once non-Party Bolsheviks, and even at the end of their lives, they never forgot the distant future, willing to be Party Bolsheviks. I respect them, I love them, and I mourn them.

　　徐老悼范亭同志
    中国老教育家徐特立同志，闻听续范亭同志逝世噩耗，特撰文悼念。原文如下：
    续范亭同志从加入同盟会以来，参加反满、反袁、反曹吴诸役，一直到抗日战争，革命一次一次深入，他的革命精神和革命斗争亦愈积极坚韧。近数年卧病不能行动，当时局到了紧急关头，还力争发表革命言论，所谓愈老愈辛辣，愈老愈年青者，范亭同志有之。鲁迅，陶行知一生为国为民，在每一革命紧急关头，尤其是革命暂时失败时，许多革命伙伴动摇落伍叛变，但他们愈坚决，愈勇敢，坚持到最后一息，我们敬之爱之，称他们为党外布尔塞维克。邹韬奋同志和续范亭同志对于革命奋斗坚持到最后一息，竟要求加入我党，以表示他们身后的希望，从国家民族解放的民主主义，一直到人类解放的共产主义，他们曾是党外的布尔塞维克，临终时还念念不忘远大的将来，愿作党内布尔塞维克，我敬之我爱之，哀悼之。
