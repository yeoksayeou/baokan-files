Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 20th: Comprehensive report: Since the beginning of September to the beginning of October, local armed forces and militia on various lines in Jin-Cha-Ji launched widespread offensives. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 6,400 Chiang Kai-shek, Fu Zuoyi, and Yan Xishan bandit troops were killed, wounded, or captured. The four cities of Xinzhen, Yongqing, Luancheng, and Qingxian were recovered, as well as more than 20 important towns such as Zhoukoudian and Fanshanbao (Fanshanbao was re-occupied by Fu bandit troops on the 4th of this month). The focus of the enemy-us struggle is still in the Pingjinbao triangle area. The military and civilians in the area first launched a severe attack on the 281st and 282nd Regiments of the 94th Division of the Chiang bandit army, which attempted to flood the liberated areas by digging up the Daqing River embankment along the Zhao Wang River near Wangcun and Kou Shang in early September, killing and wounding more than 300 enemies, recovering Xinzhen town, and thwarting the Chiang bandit's attempt to establish strongholds between Xinzhen and Maoerwan on the Daqing River. The local armed forces in the area then cooperated with the main force to advance to the north of the Daqing River, and on the 11th, captured Kaikou town under Baxian, completely annihilating more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek puppet bandit troops who were guarding the area. The local armed forces who insisted on fighting in the area launched attacks everywhere in response to the main force's operations. On September 1st and 2nd, they twice attacked Anci city, and on the 11th, they once captured Baxian city, and on the 13th, they recovered Yongqing. A unit of local armed forces active in the area west of Tianjin and south of Beiping successively captured Gugang, Yuboku, Chongzhang, important villages and towns more than 40 miles west of Tianjin, as well as Migangzi, Huluwa, Chuxianbao and other places on the west bank of the Yongding River, more than 50 miles southwest of Beiping. A certain unit of local armed forces south of Beiping also raided Lixian town, more than 70 miles directly south of Beiping, on the 19th of last month. Now a vast area in the Pingjinbao triangle area is gradually being restored by us, and the enemy is trapped in isolated strongholds. In the area east of Shijiazhuang, in early September, about seven regiments of the Chiang bandit's Third Army stationed in Gu County and Shimen, cooperated with local bullies to invade eastward along the Cangshi Road to loot grain, and occupied Zhengding and Luancheng on the 19th and 20th of last month. After the local armed forces in the area cooperated with the autumn protection team composed of liberated peasants to encircle and annihilate them, the bandits were unable to support themselves and abandoned the city and fled back to Shimen by the end of last month. Except for Zhengding, which is still occupied by Chiang bandit troops, all other areas have been recovered by us one after another. The enemy's grain looting plan has failed. In the Jin-Northeast and the west section of the Zhengtai Road, a unit of our local troops launched offensives in the areas north of Dingxiang, Xinxian, and Shouyang from the 16th to the 18th of last month and from the 4th to the 6th of this month, annihilating more than 3,000 Yan bandit troops of the 49th Division and the Pseudo-Dingxiang Security Police Brigade, and successively occupied Zhicun, Paochi, Zongai, Zhoujia’nao and many other important villages and towns. Yan bandit's nibbling plan has suffered a fatal blow.
