　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: New York dispatch: New York Times Magazine reporter Belau's recent book "There Will Be No War Between the US and the Soviet Union" states that based on the author's observations after traveling the world, there will definitely be no war between the Soviet Union and the United States within twenty years. As for what will happen after twenty years, he believes it is too early to speculate at present. The author points out that the important reason why war will not occur between the Soviet Union and the United States is: "The people's desire for peace, which is equally strong in the Soviet Union and the United States." Secondly, the people of the United States and the Soviet Union have always maintained a long-term friendly relationship. The third is economic reasons. The conclusion of the article emphasizes: "The United States cannot launch such a war, because launching a war against the Soviet Union will destroy its own political soul."

　　美记者贝尔格著文称：
  　美苏间不会有战争
    【新华社陕北十八日电】纽约讯：纽约时报周刊记者贝尔格近著“美苏之间不会有战争”一文，作者以其踏遍世界后之所见，肯定苏、美之间在二十年之内不会发生战争。至于二十年以后的事情，他认为在目前来猜测，则未免太早。作者指出苏美之间不会发生战争的重要原因乃是：“人民要求和平的愿望，这种要求在苏联和美国是同样的强烈。”其次美苏两国人民始终保持着长期的友好关系。其三是经济上的原因。该文结语着重指出：“美国不能发动这样的战争，因为发动对苏战争，它将毁灭它自己的政治灵魂。”
