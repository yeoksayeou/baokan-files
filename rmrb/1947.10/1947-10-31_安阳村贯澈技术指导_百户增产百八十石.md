　　Anyang Village Implements Technical Guidance
  　One Hundred Households Increase Production by One Hundred Eighty *Dan*
    [Our Newspaper, Ping Shun News] The Seventh District Anyang Village Technical Committee, under the call of the County Party Committee to "Improve Technology and Increase Grain Production," organized the masses to implement year-round research on agricultural technology, resulting in a general increase in autumn grain production this year. In order to summarize this achievement, the village technical committee, after the autumn harvest on the 17th of this month, combined it with autumn plowing and, after three days of deliberation and discussion in each mutual aid team, convened a meeting of all technical committee members on the evening of the 19th, using the comparison of grain increases and decreases this year with last year and with normal years to summarize this year's technical work. The technical research method throughout the year in the village adopted a mass line from bottom to top and from top to bottom. The specific approach was that each of the thirteen mutual aid teams always had a fixed committee member from the Technical Committee. In certain agricultural activities (such as spring plowing and sowing), the Technical Committee held temporary meetings, combined scientific knowledge (such as the *Farmer's Handbook*), and studied the experience of the masses. The committee members then went back to their respective teams to provide specific guidance, while at the same time concentrating the experience of the masses. The promotion was carried out by: (1) Seizing the positive factors of increasing production and wealth, and inspiring the masses to improve technology. For example, Man Fu said in his team: "There are many people and little land here, and we don't know how to engage in sideline production. Only by improving technology can we produce more grain." (2) Implementing technical work points: For example, when Lao Yingfu's team was weeding, Fu Lai didn't weed well and lost one point, while XXX weeded well and gained one point. This method was used to ensure that technology was improved. This year, technology was truly improved and promoted to the broad masses. From the accounting after the autumn harvest, the masses truly knew that grain production had increased. Hou Quangui said: "I have one *mu* of land in Luoshu Ao, which is sunny. In the past, I used hot fertilizer (sheep manure, etc.) to plant corn and only harvested eight bags. This year, after research, I changed to using @ fertilizer, and in the autumn I harvested twelve bags of corn, which is four bags (about eight *da dou*) more than in previous years." Niu Ancang said: "My four *mu* and five *fen* of land used to be weeded late, when the seedlings were only as tall as chopsticks. I didn't pay attention to technology and only harvested more than seven *shi* of grain. This year, I improved technology and weeded early, following the saying 'Weed the millet at one inch, fertilize the top,' 'Thinning seedlings is like fertilizing.' I weeded three times and also applied top dressing. This year, I harvested nine *shi* of grain, which is two *shi* more than in previous years. I am truly convinced that technology works." Niu Faqun said: "This year, we planted crops according to the soil properties, and we truly harvested more grain." Li De said: "My two *mu* of land in Yangshan Gully used to only produce eighteen bags of corn, but this year I produced twenty-two bags. I didn't expect it, and I don't remember ever harvesting so much grain." In short, regarding deep plowing, careful cultivation, and more fertilization research, based on what crops grow in what soil and what fertilizer to apply, although constantly affected by natural disasters such as spring drought, summer hail, and autumn floods, we still harvested much more grain than in normal years. According to the statistics of 101 households, with 957.71 *mu* of land, this year's grain production was 1315.595 *shi*, while last year's grain production was 1131.32 *shi*, an increase of 184.275 *shi* over last year, an average increase of one *dou* and nine *sheng* and two *ge* per *mu*. Everyone reflected: "Improving technology really brings benefits. The crops grow well, and we harvest more grain. We didn't eat regret medicine, unlike Fu Huize, who doesn't believe in technology. His three *mu* of land in Yan Jiao Ao could produce six *shi* of grain, but because he didn't select seeds in the field, he only picked the big seedlings to plant, and the more he planted, the dumber they became. The land is shady, and the seeds are also poor. This year, the crops were very green, but he still harvested one *shi* less." Lü Baoquan was afraid to pay wages and didn't weed the seedlings three times. He weeded too large and too dense, and didn't apply top dressing. His one *mu* and eight *fen* of land in Chi Bangdi should have produced twenty-four bags of corn, but this year he only produced nineteen bags. Li Laize's five *mu* of land in Tuzhangdi had others planting three or four rice plants per step, while he planted five or six plants per step. Lao Yingfu advised him, saying that he was leaving them too dense, but he didn't listen. As a result, he harvested four *shi* of grain. The masses said that his grain was "facing-the-sky grain" (small ears standing upright)." Through this comparison, the old sayings that "planting land requires no skill, just effort" and "skillful construction is not as good as clumsy fertilization" which did not believe that improving technology could increase grain production, were broken, and changed to "planting land requires skill, and effort is even better!" Only by skillful construction and more fertilization can we harvest more grain.

　　安阳村贯澈技术指导
  　百户增产百八十石
    【本报平顺讯】七区安阳村技委会，在县委“提高技术增加产粮”的号召下，组织群众贯澈全年的研究农业技术，今年秋粮普遍增产。该村技委会为总结这一工作成绩，本月十七日秋收结束后，结合秋耕，在各互助组经过三天随时随地的酝酿讨论，遂于十九日夜召开各技委员会议，用今年与去年以及与平常年粮食的增减对比来总结今年的技术工作。该村全年中技术研究方法上采取了自下而上及由上而下的群众路线。具体做法是，十三个互助组内，常固定有技委会一个委员，在一定的农事活动里（如春耕下种等），由技委会临时开会，结合科学知识（如庄稼汉手册等），研究群众经验，各委员再分回各组进行具体指导，同时再集中群众经验。在推广上是：（一）抓住增产发家的积极因素，启发群众提高技术，如满富在该组说：“咱这里人多地少，又不会搞什么副业生产，只有提高技术，多打粮食。”（二）实行技术折工：如劳英富保组锄苗时，福来锄的不好，减少一分，×××锄的好，增加一分，用这个办法，保证把技术提高，今年技术真正提高了，并推广到广大群众中，群众从秋收结束算帐中，真正知道增加了产粮，侯全贵说：“我不落树凹一亩地，地向阳，以前上的热粪（羊肥等），种玉茭往年只撇八布袋，今年研究后，改上＠肥，秋天撇玉茭十二布袋，比往年多撇了四布袋（约八大斗）。”牛安仓说：“我四亩五分地往年锄的迟，苗子一筷子高才锄，不讲技术，才打七石多粮；今年提高技术，锄的早，照着‘谷锄寸，顶上粪’，‘间苗如上粪’来干，锄了三遍，又上追粪，今年打粮九石，比往年多打二石粮，我真服气技术顶事。”牛发群说：“今年是按什么土性长什么庄稼来种，粮食真多收了”。李德说：“我羊山沟二亩地，往年只撇十八布袋玉茭，今年就撇二十二布袋，没想到，也没记得打过这样多粮食”。总之，关于深耕细作多上粪研究技术，在什么土性长什么庄稼上什么肥的基础上，虽在春旱、夏雹、秋涝等，不断的天灾袭击影响下，仍比平常年多打了很多粮食。据一○一户统计，土地九五七．七一亩，今年产粮一三一五．五九五石，去年产粮一一三一．三二石，比去年增产一八四．二七五石，平均每亩增产一斗九升二。大家反映说：“提高技术真沾光，庄稼长的好，粮食打的多，咱没吃了后悔药，不像傅会则，不相信技术，砚交凹三亩地，能打粮六石，因没在地选种，光拣大的苗种，越种越笨，地背阴，种子又笨，今年庄稼青了很多，还少打了一石粮；吕保全怕出工资，不锄三遍苗，锄的大又稠，不上追粪，池邦地一亩八分，该撇二十四布袋玉茭，今年只撇了十九布袋；李来则土掌地五亩，人家一步三安谷一安四棵，他一步五安，一安就六、七棵，劳英富保劝他，说他留稠了，他不听，结果打了四石谷，群众说他的谷是朝天谷（穗小直竖）”。经过这样对比，打破了“种地没巧，出力就好”及“巧做造不如拙上粪”等不相信提高技术能增加产粮的旧说法，而改成“种地有巧，出力更好”！只有巧做造多上粪，才能多打粮食。
