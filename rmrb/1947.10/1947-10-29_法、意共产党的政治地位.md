Q&A on Current Events

　　The Political Status of the French and Italian Communist Parties

　　Comrades Li Zhen, Xiang, Jia Yun, and others asked: Since the French and Italian Communist Parties are so powerful, why can't they participate in the government and play a significant role? When the French Communist Party was still in the government this spring, it held the position of Minister of Defense. Why didn't it order the French army to stop attacking Vietnam?

　　Answer: Regarding the French and Italian Communist Parties' domestic political role and status, we must first understand that the French and Italian Communist Parties' influence on government policy is exerted through parliamentary struggle. The current distribution of power among the parties in the French and Italian parliaments does not fully reflect the balance of class forces within the country. In parliament, whether in France or Italy, the combined seats of the Communist Party and other left-wing parties do not yet represent a united majority that can overwhelm the right wing.

　　In France, the French Communist Party is the largest party in parliament and within the French Empire. It has over one million members, more than five million eight hundred thousand voters, controls the French General Confederation of Labor (with six million five hundred thousand members), directly leads the "French Women's Union" (with approximately one million members) and the "French Young Republican Group" (with three hundred thousand members), and its newspapers sell around two million copies daily. It holds unparalleled prestige within the French working class. However, its voting power in parliament is currently not enough to form a majority (the French Communist Party only occupies 186 out of 619 seats in the current parliament, or 30 percent). Due to the French Socialist Party's upper echelons betraying the interests of the working class and actively engaging in anti-communist activities, the French Communist Party's voting power in parliament is often in the minority. According to the constitution, the French government cannot be changed or overthrown without a majority vote of no confidence in parliament.

　　The situation in Italy is similar. There, the Communist Party (with two million five hundred thousand members) and the Nenni Socialist Party have formed a strong alliance, controlling the General Confederation of Labor with seven million members. However, in parliament, the Communist Party is the third-largest party, and the Socialist Party is the second-largest party (but since the right wing of the party, led by Saragat, split off, forty percent of the Socialist Party's seats have also been split off. Thus the Nenni Socialist Party might be the third-largest party in parliament, and the Communist Party might have risen to the second-largest). Their combined votes are also a minority in parliament. Currently, the Italian Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Action Party, and the Labor Democratic Party have formed a "People's Group," which is the true people's front within Italy. However, it still constitutes a minority in parliament.

　　It is worth mentioning that although the various right-wing parties in France and Italy are a minority among the people, they temporarily control the majority in parliament. To oppose democracy, they are naturally united. It is this reactionary alliance that has brought democratic reforms in France and Italy to a standstill. This right-wing reactionary front cannot be underestimated. They have plenty of money and control over 90 percent of the country's propaganda tools. At the same time, the broad middle class in the country are busy with daily life, and are either indifferent to political issues, lack sufficient understanding, are careless, are easily deceived, or are constrained by traditional inertia and other backward elements, giving them blind support temporarily. In addition, they have the political, diplomatic, economic, and spiritual support of American and British imperialists and the Vatican Catholic Church. Therefore, they still have the strength to constitute a considerable obstacle in the French and Italian people's struggle for democracy. But the people's awakening is increasing daily, and their strength is growing. This obstacle will ultimately be swept away.

　　The relationship between France and its colonies does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense, but rather the Ministry of Overseas Colonies. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense does not have the authority to order a stop to the war in Vietnam. A ceasefire order must be issued by the Prime Minister, and the Ministry of Overseas Colonies cannot handle it alone either.

### 法、意共产党的政治地位

　　法、意共产党的政治地位
    粒珍、襄、家耘等同志问：在法、意两国共产党的力量既然非常强大，为什么不能参加政府起相当作用呢？今年春天法共仍在政府中时，既担任了国防部长，为什么不下令要法军停止进攻越南？
    答：关于法、意共产党在国内的政治作用与地位问题，我们首先应了解：法意共产党对政府政策的作用，乃是通过议会的斗争，而目前法意议会中各党力量的分配，并不能充分反映国内的阶级力量对比。在议会中，无论是在法国或意大利，共产党与其他左派的议席，在目前还均不是压倒右派的联合多数。
    在法国，法共在议会中和在法帝国内部都是第一大党，它有党员一百余万，拥有选民五百八十余万，它控制着法国总工会（会员六百五十万），直接领导着“法国妇女联盟”（会员约百万）和“法国青年共和主义团”（会员三十万），它的报刊日销两百万份左右。它在法国工人阶级中有无上的威信。但是它在议会的投票力量，现在还不能形成过半数（法共议席在目前议会六百十九席中仅占一百八十六席，或百分之三十），由于法国社会党上层出卖工人阶级利益积极反共的活动，法共在议会中的投票力量常常总是少数，而如果议会中没有过半数的不信任票，按照宪法规定，则法国的政府就不可能改变或使其垮台。
    在意大利情况亦是如此。在那里，共产党（党员二百五十万）与南尼社会党结成强固的联盟，控制着拥有七百万会员的总工会，但是在议会中共产党是第三大党，社会党是第二大党（但由于该党右派以萨拉盖特为首分裂出党之后，社会党议席亦被分裂出去百分之四十，因此南尼社会党可能在议会中是第三党，而共产党可能升为第二党），他们的联合票数，亦同样为议会中的少数。现在意共与社会党、行动党、劳工民主党结成“人民集团”，为意国内真正的人民阵线，可是在议会中在现在仍然还是少数。
    值得提及的是，法意右派各党虽然在人民中是少数，但在议会中暂时还操纵着多数，为了反民主，他们是自然地结合在一起。正是这一反动的联合，使法意的民主改革迄今在搁浅中。这一右派反动阵线，不能忽视他们有的是钱，有的是全国百分之九十以上的宣传工具，同时国内广大中间阶层每日奔忙于生活，对政治问题或漠不关心、或认识不足、或马虎了事、或易受欺骗、或拘于传统惰性等等落后性，对它们暂时还盲目支持；此外，他们还有美英帝国主义分子及梵蒂岗天主教会的政治、外交、经济与精神各方面的支持，因此它们在法意人民争取民主的斗争中暂时还有力量构成相当的障碍。但人民的觉醒正日益提高，力量正日益强大，这障碍是终必可以扫除的。
    法国与其殖民地的关系，不属国防部管辖，而属海外殖民地部。因此国防部无权下令停止对越战事。停战令须由总理来发布，海外殖民地部亦不能单独处理。
