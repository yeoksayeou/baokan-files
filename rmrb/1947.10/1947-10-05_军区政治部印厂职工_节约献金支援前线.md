　　Employees of Military Region Political Department Printing Plant
  　Conserve and Donate to Support the Front Lines

    [Our Dispatch] Encouraged by the victory of the great counter-offensive, the printing plant of the Military Region Political Department is intensifying its study and work to cooperate with the great counter-offensive and continue to implement the support-the-front movement. On the 22nd, the trade union convened a current affairs forum. At the meeting, Comrade Zhao Lian of the proofreading section was the first to speak, saying: "I first guarantee to do a good job in my unit and reduce typos." Zhang Fuyou, a worker in the lithography room, said: "Maps are the most urgent these days. We must print them day and night to ensure that every character is clear. I also propose to challenge all printing plants in the military region, so that the front and rear can unite to eliminate the Chiang bandits!" Lv Zhenbang, the head of the general affairs section, rushed to speak: "In order to cooperate with the plant's work to support the front lines, I guarantee to take good care of our lives, so that comrades are healthy and have the energy to work hard. In addition, I will save all the shoes and socks I should receive this year and donate them to the front!" Guo Jianmin, a worker in the typesetting room, naively said: "My opinion is to launch a Mid-Autumn Festival labor service to the army, write letters of condolence, and send each person's favorite things to the front, sew condolence bags, and sew Taihang Mountain gloves. Now that it is cold, the comrades will fight well when they wear them!" At this time, the focus of the discussion has shifted to the conditions for challenging all printing plants in the military region, and everyone is vying to speak. Everyone unanimously passed the letter of challenge to challenge all printing plants in the military region. Comrade Zhao Shudian of the typesetting department said: "I will donate 10,000 yuan, a new leather satchel, and 20 catties of rice per month until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated!" He is a trainee, and he has little left each month after food and clothing. Therefore, his speech shocked the entire venue, and everyone competed to announce their personal support plans. Until the meeting was dismissed, some comrades did not have the chance to speak, so they had to post their support plans on the broadcasting station. According to statistics: There are a total of 87 people in the plant, 30 people donate rice every month, donating a total of 263 catties of rice per month until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated. 20 people donated money, a total of 67,000 yuan, and 42 people donated items, a total of one new leather bag, 276 towels, 24 bars of soap, more than 10 condolence bags, as well as toothbrushes, toothpaste, socks, shoes, etc. (Gui Qin)
