　　Buying Livestock Together, Diligently Accumulating Fertilizer, Yuan Dynasty Seventh District Plants More Wheat
　　[Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei on the 8th] The seventh district of Yuan Dynasty is jointly purchasing cattle and diligently accumulating fertilizer, planning to plant more than 10,000 mu of wheat, reaching 65 percent of the cultivated land. People often say: "Having land without cattle means worry for farming!" There is a shortage of livestock in the district, and the masses are asking to add livestock, but one family cannot afford to buy it, so they call on the masses to buy together in groups of two or three families. The government also used this spring's loan to buy a "bull seed" and a "donkey seed", striving for every cow and donkey in the district to raise a small livestock every year. After deliberation by the masses, a trend of buying cattle together has formed. In four villages in Kongtang sub-district, eleven cattle and two donkeys were added in two days, and sixteen households added feeding livestock. The entire district has a total of forty-three villages, five thousand five hundred and seventy-eight households, with a total of one hundred and twelve thousand and forty-six mu of cultivated land; last year, the entire district had a total of three thousand and seventy-two households feeding livestock, this year there are three thousand five hundred and forty-seven households, an increase of four hundred and seventy-five households; last year there were a total of two thousand seven hundred and four cattle and donkeys, this year there are three thousand two hundred and seventeen, an increase of four hundred and seventy-seven; last year there were a total of two thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven small livestock, this year there are three thousand three hundred and twenty-two, an increase of five hundred and thirty-five; this year each livestock corresponds to thirty mu of cultivated land. They are still actively buying livestock, striving for every family to have livestock next year. In terms of accumulating fertilizer, the statistics of thirty-eight villages (excluding Zhanglu sub-district): After the wheat harvest, two hundred and seventy-three thousand and sixty large carts of grass manure have been accumulated, and another nine thousand and thirty-eight carts of fertilizer are planned to be accumulated. A total of three hundred and sixty-three thousand four hundred and forty-four carts of fertilizer will be applied to wheat planting, an increase of one thousand two hundred and eighty-six carts compared to last year. Due to the abundance of manure and livestock, the difficulty of wheat planting has been greatly solved. The average requirement for wheat planting area in the entire district is 65 percent. This year, it is planned to plant more than 13,006 mu of wheat. In order to ensure the realization of this wheat planting plan, the leadership put forward the slogan "Every person plants an extra half mu of wheat." Huang Chaoshu, a labor hero from Huazhuang, said: "If the early crop is not enough, the late crop will make up for it, so that everyone plants an extra half mu." Under the call to rush for the late crop, the masses in various villages are actively harvesting and planting wheat early.

　　伙买牲口勤积肥元朝七区多种麦
    【本报冀南八日电】元朝七区伙买牛勤积肥，计划多种麦万余亩，达到耕地百分之六十五。常说：“有地没有牛，种地得发愁！”该区牲口少，群众都要求添牲口，但一家买不起，便号召群众两家三家伙买，政府又以今春贷款买了一头“牛种”和一个“驴种”，争取全区母牛母驴每年养一个小牲口。经过群众酝酿后，形成伙买牛的风气，孔堂小区四个村两天添牛十一头、驴两个，添喂牲口的十六户。全区共四十三个村五千五百七十八户，共耕地十一万二千零四十六亩；去年全区喂牲口户共三千零七十二户，今年三千五百四十七户，增加四百七十五户；去年牛驴共二千七百零四个，今年三千二百一十七个，增加四百七十七个，去年小牲口共二千七百八十七个，今年三千三百二十二个，增加五百三十五个；今年每个牲口合耕地三十亩。现仍在积极买牲口，争取明年家家有牲口。在积肥上，三十八个村的统计（缺张鲁小区）：麦后已积草粪二万七千三百零六大车，还计划积肥九千零卅八车，种麦施肥共三万六千三百四十四车，比去年增一千二百八十六车。由于粪大牲口多，大大的解决了种麦困难，全区平均要求种麦面积达到百分之六十五。今年计划多种麦子一万三千零六亩，为保证实现这一种麦计划，领导上提出“每人多种半亩麦”的口号。化庄劳动英雄黄朝书说：“早茬不够，晚茬补，达到每人多种半亩。”在多赶晚茬的号召下，各村群众正积极收割提前早种麦。
