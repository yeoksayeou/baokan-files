The Changyuan Militia Truly Heroic
	Ten Days, Five Battles to Protect the Autumn Harvest
	Gao Zanyuan Establishes Joint Defense Command
	Unifying Efforts to Launch Grain Protection Struggle
[This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, twelfth dispatch] To protect the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the Changyuan militia fought five battles in ten days, resolutely打击 ("strike hard") against the "Returning Home Corps." Changyuan's Chiang Kai-shek's [forces] and puppet troops, in order to sabotage our autumn harvest and wheat planting, sent township "Returning Home Corps" to our central areas – Lao'an, Qianda Lou area – multiple times a day to kill the masses and rob livestock. From September 11th to 20th alone, in ten days, a total of sixteen young adults were injured and taken away (one killed), and sixty-eight head of livestock were taken (six of which were later recovered by our militia). In Qianda Lou village, Fifth District, all ten head of livestock in the entire village were taken away except for two. Such atrocities have aroused the vigilance of the masses throughout the county. In order to protect the able-bodied men, protect the livestock, and victoriously complete the autumn harvest and wheat planting tasks, the Changyuan militia engaged the enemy in five battles within ten days. On the 14th, over thirty enemies came to our ×× market, and militia squad leader Yu Fubang led three militiamen to repel the enemy; on the 18th, over two hundred enemies launched a surprise attack on the border between Hua and Chang, and our Seventh District militia intercepted them on the road near Denggang, capturing two enemies, seizing 900,000 Chiang currency, thirty hand grenades, and two head of livestock. That same day at 11 p.m., the puppet township office, in conjunction with bandit puppet Shang Zongkong's forces of over two hundred men, raided Li Di, Song Zi and other villages. They were first discovered by our ×× militia sentry post, who gathered more than twenty militiamen and engaged in street fighting on Hengdao. After fifteen minutes, we charged three times, but due to the enemy's superior numbers, we tactically withdrew outside the village. Militiamen from surrounding villages heard the news and rushed to reinforce. The enemy, hearing the cries of killing from all sides, fled in panic. Our militia took the opportunity to pursue them for more than three *li*, capturing six fleeing landlord family members and seizing several bundles.

[This newspaper, Gaoyi News] In order to strengthen the grain protection struggle, Gao, Zan, and Yuan counties have established a forward joint defense command, unifying leadership in the struggle against the enemy, establishing militia joint defense, breaking down county and district boundaries, and providing mutual support in case of enemy activity. On September 19th, over a hundred enemies from Yuanshi, carrying two machine guns, came to Beiyan village in Yuanshi to plunder. Upon hearing this, militiamen from thirteen villages including Dongxi Maxian and Niujiazhuang in our county immediately came to support and repelled the enemy. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than ten casualties, leaving behind six corpses. From then on, the relationship between the two counties became even closer. The three Maxian militiamen in our Third District each night dispatched ×× men to Beiyan village to support activities. Wei Yonghe, the traitor, after being thwarted in several robberies, personally led a regiment of Yuanshi puppet troops, three cars, and five hundred puppet troops and special agents' family members to Dachengzhuang, Zhuangwo Li in Yuanshi and Gusicun in our Third District of our county on the morning of October 1st to carry out massive looting. Three charges were bravely repelled by our camp soldiers and work teams, the enemy suffered more than twenty casualties, and we suffered no casualties.

[This newspaper] On the morning of the 4th of this month, the enemy stationed in Dawang and Banqiao, with a force of two battalions, again harassed the area around Qianhou Xiazhuang and Wangzhang villages in our border areas, attempting to loot grain and obstruct the local masses' land reform movement. Upon hearing this, our "Xiu Huo Column" quickly launched an attack and pounced on the enemy, quickly occupying the enemy's positions and suppressing the puppet troops with intense firepower. The puppet troops then launched continuous counterattacks against us, but were eventually repelled by us. Our two companies repelled the attack of the enemy's two battalions, killing and wounding more than forty enemies and seizing some guns, ammunition, etc. Upon returning after the battle, the masses welcomed them along the streets and offered their condolences.
