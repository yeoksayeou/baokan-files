　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: A portion of the Northwest People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive force captured the strongly fortified enemy counties of Yanchuan and Yanchang in one fell swoop on the 2nd. Both cities are less than eighty kilometers west of Yan'an. Yanchuan is one of the important strongholds on the Xianyang-Yulin highway, a major transportation line for the Chiang-Hu army in the Northwest. Yanchang is the location of a nationally famous oil mine. The Liberation Army attacked Yanchuan at 8:00 a.m. and completely annihilated the 2nd Battalion of the 35th Regiment of the 12th Brigade of the 17th Division and the entire security police force within an hour. Chiang bandit county chief Jiang Menghen, deputy county chief Chang Yuntian, county director instructor Wang Xihou, security police force commander Nie Ruixiang, and other bandits were all captured. At the same time, the enemy's 76th Division's transportation battalion was defeated at San Shi Li Pu on the Yanchuan-Qingjian highway, and most of them were captured. The city of Yanchang was also captured by our army at 9:00 p.m. on the same day, and all the defending enemies were annihilated. Detailed battle results of the capture of the two cities are still being investigated.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: Following the victory at Chakou, the Northwest People's Counter-offensive Army continued to sweep away the Chiang-Hu bandit army near Yan'an, and has successively captured Panlong, where the enemy's 167th Brigade of the 1st Division was annihilated, Qinghuabian, where the enemy's 31st Brigade of the 26th Division was annihilated, Yao Dianzi, which is only twenty kilometers west of Yan'an City, as well as Yongping, Ganguyi, Long'an and other important strongholds. The enemy entrenched in Yan'an is now completely isolated.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: The Northwest People's Counter-offensive Army suddenly appeared in the Chiang bandit-controlled area between Luochuan and Yichuan a few days ago, and successively captured Guanfu and Jiu Xian, two strongholds on the Luochuan-Yichuan highway and twenty kilometers east of Luochuan. Another unit of the Liberation Army advancing into the Guanzhong Chiang area, following the liberation of Baishui County, the Fenglei Coal Mine, and the two important towns of Gaoyang and Hongtu in late last month, has expanded its offensive, successively capturing Liujing, thirty li west of Pucheng, Xinyao and Linggao in Baishui County, and Leiyuan, thirty-five li southeast of Yijun, and other important strongholds, opening up new liberated areas in the greater Guanzhong area, which has been ruled by Hu Zongnan for more than ten years.

　　陕甘宁蒋胡匪肃清期近
    我军收复延川延长
  　延安附近克青化砭甘谷驿关抚等地直捣关中我军扩展攻势创新解放区
    【新华社西北三日电】西北人民解放军反攻大军一部，二日一举攻克敌强固设防之延川及延长两县城。该两城均西距延安不及八十公里，延川系蒋胡军西北主要交通线咸（阳）榆（林）公路上之重要据点之一，延长为全国著名之石油矿所在地。解放军于清晨八时进击延川，一小时内即将守敌十七师十二旅三十五团二营及保警纵队全部歼灭，蒋匪县长蒋梦痕、副县长常云天、县主任指导员王锡侯、保警纵队长聂瑞祥等匪徒无一漏网。同时，并在延（川）清（涧）公路间之三十里铺击溃敌七十六师辎重营，并俘其大部。延长县城亦于是日夜九时为我军攻克，守敌全部就歼。攻克两城之详细战果正清查中。
    【新华社西北三日电】岔口大捷后，西北人民反攻大军继续扫荡延安附近之蒋胡匪军，已先后攻克曾于该处歼敌第一师一六七旅之蟠龙，歼敌二十六师三十一旅之青化砭，及西距延安市仅二十公里之姚店子，以及永坪、甘谷驿、龙安等重要据点。困踞延安之敌，已完全陷于孤立。
    【新华社西北三日电】西北人民反攻大军于日前突然出现于洛川、宜川间之蒋匪统治区，连克洛（川）宜（川）公路线上之关抚及洛川东二十公里之旧县两据点。而挺进关中蒋区之另部解放军，继上月下旬解放白水县城及冯雷煤矿与高阳红土两重镇后，复扩展攻势，连克蒲城西三十里之六井，白水县之新窑、灵高，及宜君东南三十五里之雷原等重要据点，在胡宗南统治十余年之大关中，开辟了新的解放区。
