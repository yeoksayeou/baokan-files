　　A Self-Description of an Ideological Transformation
    Yang Bo
    The eighteen-year-old youth, Xie Yu, was originally a student at Xinjiang Middle School. His family was a large bureaucrat and landlord in Shanxi. When our army liberated Xinjiang, he joined the revolutionary ranks and studied in the training corps. Initially, he had great concerns in his mind, but after land reform and current affairs study, he transformed his thinking and recognized the sins of his family and the life he had led in the past. The following self-description of his ideological transformation can be used as a reference for comrades in the Three Check-ups study.

    I am truly sorry to the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army. When I first came to the training corps, I fabricated my resume and deceived my superiors, saying that my family was very poor and that I was forced to wander into Yan's territory. In fact, my family is a large bureaucrat and landlord in Fanshi County, with four or five large and small businesses, and more than 3,000 acres of fertile land. I have seventeen uncles and brothers, most of whom are working for the stubborn Yan faction. In particular, my second brother, Xie Lian, has served as a regiment commander, brigade commander, division commander, and commander-in-chief of the Shanxi Security Forces under Yan's rule. He is still serving as a senior cadre of the Comrades Association and the deputy hill owner of the Progressive Society, as well as the chief supervisor of the Military Law Headquarters, and the military commander-in-chief of the Fanshi and Dai counties.
    Speaking of my family's life, it was truly a life of wine pools and meat forests, carefree and comfortable, extraordinarily corrupt. The dining table was made of jade, the chopsticks were made of gold, and we were tired of eating sharks' fins and sea cucumbers. We were too lazy to eat pork and mutton. We covered ourselves with satin quilts and wore silk clothes. The residence was not bad either. We built a large building at No. 12 Guoshi Street in Taiyuan, with glass windows and glass doors, with a circumference of more than one li. When we went out, we either took the train or the car. Even when we went out to play, we had to take a car or rickshaw… In short, we were as extravagant as possible and had everything we needed. Now that I think about it, where did these blessings come from? By farming? Then where did those 3,000 acres of land come from? Moreover, there was not a single person in my family who actually farmed. By doing business? Then where did the capital for doing business come from? Moreover, there was not a single person in my family who actually did business. By being an official? If it was an official who truly sought the interests of the people, then where would the money come from? After thinking and thinking, I thought about where this blessing came from. Finally, I figured it out: My family's wealth and good life were entirely obtained through exploitation. They were entirely the blood and sweat of the working masses. Didn't the high rents we collected every year come from the fruits of the farmers' blood and sweat? Didn't the large sums of money my brothers brought back from their official positions come from the extortion and blackmail of the farmers' blood and sweat? With this money, we went to lend money and do business, relying on other people's labor to make money ourselves. Wasn't that still exploiting other people's blood and sweat? Moreover, when money and officialdom were combined, the more and bigger the officials, the more and broader the money. Conversely, money could be exchanged for official positions. The more and broader the money, the bigger and more numerous the officials. In this way, my family naturally became richer and richer, but I don't know how many working people were forced onto the road of starvation and death because of my family's wealth? The more I think about it, the sadder I become. I simply don't have the courage to think any further, but I have to think about it: because I have initially recognized the truth!
    Because I was born into a bureaucratic landlord class, I enjoyed a lot of blessings and committed many evils. I also have a deep understanding of their internal darkness and a thorough understanding of their crimes of cruelly exploiting and oppressing the people. Once I recognized the truth, the transformation was quick. Moreover, I am only eighteen years old and still have great hopes for my future! I was once a great sinner of the people. I don't know how much money, earned from the blood and sweat of the people, I squandered in eighteen years? I have realized that I am an eighteen-year-old youth who was raised on the blood and sweat of the people, so I must resolutely break away from that sinful bureaucratic landlord class and resolutely serve the people to atone for my sins and repay the farmers' kindness. Not only must I resolutely break away from family ties and never return to my home in Fanshi, but I must also divorce my unmarried woman, because her father, Cui Qirui, is not only a large landlord in Hunyuan County, but also a major general staff officer in Yan's faction. In addition, there is a vinegar workshop in Jinan County that is specifically for my studies. I plan to take some time to take a look. If the government has not confiscated it yet, I will hand over all the materials to the public - anyway, I am going to start serving the people, and I want to start my new historical life!
    “Here, after land reform and the study of current events, and then connecting with my past in Yan's territory and my present in the Eighth Route Army” has quickly transformed my thinking. I remember when I was studying in Yan's territory, they were constantly propagating and educating: how the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army harassed the people and captured soldiers, how they filled the sea trenches with students alive, how they shared wives and had no humanity, how they killed people like cutting grass, how they had no strength… Anyway, they wanted to make the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army seem as hateful, detestable, terrible, and killable as possible. I, who had not seen much of the world, could not help but be deceived! After arriving in the liberated area, I saw everything in the liberated area with my own eyes. It was completely not as they had propagated. It was not the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army who were hateful, detestable, and killable, but precisely Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and the gang of bad guys they led (including my second brother)…”

### 一个思想转变的自述

　　一个思想转变的自述
    杨波
    十八岁的青年谢昱，原来是新绛中学的学生，家庭是山西的大官僚大地主，我军解放新绛时到革命队伍里来，在教导队里学习，开始思想上存在很大顾虑，经过土改及时事学习，转变了思想，认清了家庭及自己过去所过的生活罪恶。下面这一段思想转变的自述，可供同志们在三查学习中参考。
    ——编者
    我真对不起共产党，对不起八路军，当我刚来教导队学习的时候，曾假造履历，欺哄上级，说自己家庭怎样怎样穷，迫不得已流落阎方。其实我家是繁峙县的大官僚大地主，大小生意四五座，肥沃土地三千多亩，光我叔伯弟兄就十七个，大部分在顽方干事，特别是我二哥谢濂，曾历任阎顽的团长、旅长、军长、山西保安总司令等职，现在仍兼任同志会的高干与进步社的副山主军法总监部的总监，繁、代两县的军事总指挥等要职。
    “提起我家的生活，那真是酒池肉林逍遥自在，享乐作福，腐化非凡了。吃饭的桌子是玉石的，筷子是金的，沈鱼海参都吃腻了，猪肉羊肉更懒得吃，盖的是缎被子，穿的是绸衣衫；住的也不坏，在太原国师街修有一座门牌十二号的大楼房，玻璃窗玻璃门，方圆大到一里多；走起路来，不是坐火车，便是坐汽车，就是到街上玩，也要坐个小汽车或人力车……总而言之能阔尽阔，应有尽有。现想起来，这些福是那里来的呢？靠种地吧？那三千多亩地又是那里来的呢？况且我家根本就没有一个种地的人；靠做生意吧！做生意的资本又是那里来的呢？况且我家里又没有一个真正做生意的人；靠做官吧！如果是真正为老百姓谋利益的官，又那里会有钱呢？想来想去，想这个福从何来的问题。最后算是想通了：我家之所有那样多的钱财，过那样好的生活，完全是靠剥削得来的，完全是劳苦大众的血汗，每年收很多的地租不都是农民血汗换来的果实吗？我哥哥们当官拿回来大批大批的金钱，不都是农民的血汗结晶被勒索讹诈而来的吗？有了这些钱又去放帐，又去做生意，靠别人劳动，自己赚钱，不还是剥削别人的血汗吗？况且钱和官结合起来，官越多越大，钱也就越多越广；反过来钱又可以换官，钱越多越广，官也就越大越多，这样一来我家是自然越搞越富，但不知有多少劳苦人民却因为我家的富而被迫走上饥饿死亡的道路？越想我越难过，我简直没有勇气再往下想，但又不得不想：因为我已初步的认识了真理！
    因为我出身官僚地主阶级，享的福不少，作的恶也多，对他们内部的黑暗了解的也很深刻，对他们如何残酷的剥削压迫人民的罪行了解也很彻底，一旦认识了真理转变的就快。况且我才十八岁，对自己的前途还抱有很大的希望！我曾经是个人民的大罪人，十八年间不知任意挥霍了多少人民血汗换来的金钱？我已经体会到我是人民血汗养活大的十八岁的青年，所以我要坚决脱离原来那罪恶的官僚地主阶级，坚决为人民服务以消自己的罪，并报农民的恩。我不但要坚决脱离家庭关系永远不再回繁峙的家，而且我还要和我那未婚的女人离婚，因为她父亲崔琪瑞不但是个浑源县的大地主，而且是阎顽方面的少将参谋长。此外在晋南××县还有专供我念书的醋房，我准备抽空去看看，如果公家还没有没收，我即将所有物资全部交公——反正我是要开始为人民服务，我要开展自己新的历史生命！
    “在这里经过土改及时事学习以后，再连系到自己在顽方的过去和到八路军以后的现在”使我的思想很快转变了过来。记得我在顽方念书的时候，他们整天宣传教育着：共产党八路军，怎样扰民抓兵，怎样把学生们活活的填进海壕，怎样共产妻毫无人性，怎样杀人如割草怎样没有力量…反正他们要把共产党八路军说得可恶、可恨、可怕、可杀到极点，没有多见过世面的我，那里能不受欺骗呢？！到了解放区以后，亲眼看见了解放区的一切，完全不是如他们所宣传一样可恶可恨可杀的不是共产党八路军，却正是蒋介石、阎锡山和他们所领导的一群坏蛋家伙们（包括我二哥在内）……”
