    Household Dividends Energize Everyone; Reaping and Threshing Can Match the Men
    [This Dispatch from Jincheng] In Dongtuhe Village, Seventh District, in order to overcome the difficulty of a labor shortage in the village and to quickly complete the autumn harvest and planting, the positive role of semi-able-bodied labor was greatly brought into play. When they began the autumn harvest, they assigned tasks to women, children, and old men. Wang Aizhen, a member of the Women's Committee (and a military dependent), personally served as the deputy leader of a mutual aid team, first experimenting with organizing women for the autumn harvest. After gaining experience, she then organized all the women in the village. The women's Xia'ai team in the back street consisted of six women, four with unbound feet, who carried 140 loads of manure (four mu's worth) in two days, and two with bound feet, who carried one mu's worth. The experience gained from these two teams was that women could not only participate in harvesting crops, but also participate in heavy labor. They automatically organized themselves into 35 teams (small teams are easier to lead) comprised of 142 women who harvested 454 mu of millet in four days and raked 215.3 mu in three days. Ninety-one children were organized who harvested 145 mu of millet in four days and raked 91 mu in two days. Wang Zhengui, a sixty-year-old veteran's family member, planted five mu of land by himself and helped other military dependents with five workdays. (Wang Yi)
