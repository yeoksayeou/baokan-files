　　Persisting in Guerrilla Warfare Experience
　　Jiluyu Branch

　　After the Liu-Deng army crossed the river, Yunbei, Linze, Yuncheng, Yunju, and Juye counties were all liberated, and they quickly transitioned to land reform and war support work. In order to salvage its declining situation in Henan, the Chiang bandit gang transferred some remnants from the eastern and western battlefields, making this area the center of the Chiang army's offensive encirclement. All cadres and masses quickly transitioned to guerrilla warfare. From the beginning to the easing of the situation, a total of twenty-one days passed. At the joint county committee meeting, the experience of these twenty-one days of guerrilla warfare was summarized. The main points were that the combination of armed struggle, intelligence work, and reliance on the masses was good, which is why the struggle in the hinterland was successfully sustained and work was carried out. It was also clearly pointed out that the main obstacle to persisting in the struggle was still right-leaning, retreating thought. The summary pointed out that this period of guerrilla warfare had many achievements and innovations. Most areas persisted in the struggle, struck the enemy, and protected the interests of the masses. First, in armed struggle, many model examples emerged. For example, the Linze Brigade, in emergency situations, dispersed into platoons, penetrating deep into the hinterland to provide timely support for district and village cadres and the masses, and persisted in the struggle. After the enemy brigades passed, they concentrated their activities to strike at the "Returning Home Legions" (还乡团). In more than twenty days, they fought sixteen battles. In the Zheng Ying battle alone, the brigade, combined with the militia, completely annihilated the Yihezhuang puppet district headquarters, killing and wounding forty or fifty enemies. Under our active attacks, the "Returning Home Legions" did not spread out, and the masses were not harmed by them. In dispersed armed struggle, there were even more examples, such as Comrade Bian Luji, secretary of the Linze Third District Party Committee, who led thirteen militiamen to defeat more than two hundred "Returning Home Legions." Ma Guang'an, a militia hero from the Yunju Seventh District, said that the Fifth Army in Yinmaji was not to be feared. Furthermore, Comrade Yin Daoshuang from Yuncheng Fourth District, after other cadres withdrew, independently led seven militiamen to actively persist in the struggle. Cadres in the Yunbei Fifth District, combined with the militia, actively operated within one or two li of the enemy. Cadres in the Third District, combined with the militia, also persisted very well. The county brigade flexibly shifted positions during the enemy's offensive, striking unexpectedly and catching them off guard, and also attacked the enemy from the rear. The fourth, fifth, and eighth districts of Yuncheng all persisted very well, and there were many other good examples in other counties. These vivid examples of struggle shattered the erroneous view held by some people that small, dispersed armed forces could not persist, and that concentrated forces could not deal with the enemy. Second, relying on the masses to persist in the struggle in the hinterland raised the cadres' belief in the masses. For example, Comrade Ma Da, the county magistrate of Yunbei, led some cadres to persist in the struggle in several districts around Liangshan, hiding in sorghum fields in the morning and going into the villages to work in the afternoon. The third, first, and fifth districts were able to continue their work. They all received warm support from the masses, who automatically provided water, food, and reconnaissance. The Sixth District Party Committee, before the emergency arrived, held cadre meetings and militia meetings to study the situation, cleared up the thinking about relying on the masses to persist in the area, and carried out extensive propaganda work among the masses. The masses had a correct understanding of the situation. They said, "If the big river has less water, the small river will soon dry up!" (referring to the Chiang army's overall decline), so when the emergency arrived, there was no panic among the cadres and masses in the entire district. Cadres in the Yuncheng Fourth District cut sorghum for the masses during the day and went into the villages to work at night. The fifth and sixth districts carried out land reform during the intense guerrilla warfare. This period of guerrilla warfare proved that all those who persisted in the area, sharing life and death with the masses, and protecting the interests of the masses, received warm support from the masses and further strengthened the relationship with the masses. Those who simply hid themselves were bound to be dissatisfied by the masses. Cadres who persisted in the struggle in the hinterland were often in high spirits, completely breaking free from fear; while those who retreated and fled suffered from hunger and hardship and were in a sorry state. Third, establishing flexible and widespread intelligence work means combining direct reconnaissance with mass intelligence. The persistence of the armed forces in each county demonstrated this point. Taking our own direct reconnaissance as the backbone, and combining it with the masses' conscious and voluntary reconnaissance and intelligence work, we were able to understand the situation in a timely manner and seize the initiative.

　　The above three points fully demonstrate that our various tasks can be persisted in after the enemy occupies the territory, and that great achievements have been made. The most serious shortcoming of this period of guerrilla warfare was mainly the right-leaning and retreating thought of some areas and some cadres. They were intimidated by the enemy. The specific manifestations of the right-leaning thought of some cadres in × county were: (1) Believing that the masses were backward and could not be relied upon; They were very disappointed with the masses and helpless in the face of the enemy's methods of controlling the masses, thinking that the masses were controlled by the enemy and could not be relied upon; They did not see clearly the basic demands of the masses. (3) They had no confidence in intelligence work, thinking that it was impossible to gather intelligence, and therefore lost the confidence to persist. (4) They had nowhere to go after fighting, so they could not fight. (5) They believed that our main forces crossing the river had attracted more enemies, and although the overall situation was good, there was still a danger of death in this area before it improved. Under the control of these erroneous ideas, they could only show right-leaning and retreating tendencies in the face of the enemy's rule. Comrade ××× from Linze said: "Riding a horse and eating roasted chicken, I don't even know where the bones were thrown!" Therefore, he simply hid in the fields and did not actively carry out work. These ideas show a lack of trust in the masses, a lack of mass concept, and an inability to actively overcome difficulties and share life and death with the masses in any situation. In the future, to persist in guerrilla warfare, we must strengthen ideological leadership, give play to the consciousness of all cadres to persist in guerrilla warfare. If this problem is not solved, we will not be able to successfully hold our positions, cooperate with the major counter-offensive, and drive the enemy out. But this is an arduous task, and we must give full play to the leadership's determination to carry out in-depth work, deeply explore the cadres' true thoughts, inspire and praise their positive aspects, establish righteousness, and improve the concept of serving the masses. The second prominent idea is the issue of combining guerrilla warfare with land reform, believing that in villages where land reform has been carried out and the masses have been mobilized, the deeper the contradictions, the more the masses will panic and flee when the enemy arrives, making it impossible to rely on them. Villages where land reform has not been carried out have fewer contradictions and are easier to rely on. This views land reform and guerrilla warfare as contradictory and raises doubts about our policies. Therefore, we must deeply study the root causes of this problem. Why can't work be improved after land reform? The main reasons are: (1) Due to the existence of one's own right-leaning thoughts, it is impossible to conduct active ideological education for village cadres and the masses, mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses to hold their positions; The combination of one's own right-leaning thoughts and the right-leaning thoughts of village cadres forms a right-leaning trend. If the masses do not receive support and reliance, how can they not be afraid and flee? (2) Correct and extensive current affairs education was not carried out. If we carry out correct current affairs education for the masses, dispel their concerns in a timely manner, and educate them to lead the masses and do a good job in controlling rural organizations and arming them, we can avoid chaos and successfully hold our positions. However, the leadership lacks this kind of ideological preparation, which has caused some of our well-established base areas to be unable to persist. (3) The masses are not fully mobilized, and some village cadres and activists are seriously divorced from the masses, and the masses are dissatisfied with the cadres. Under the control of right-leaning thoughts, it is impossible to recognize and solve this problem from a positive perspective. (4) It also shows that we do not adequately care for village cadres and activists, and we have not done a good job in organizing, managing, and educating them, or in boldly giving play to their initiative and strength.

　　冀鲁豫二分区
  　坚持游击战争经验
    冀鲁豫分社
    刘邓大军过河之后，郓北、临泽、郓城、郓钜、钜野等县全获解放，迅速转入土地改革及战勤工作。蒋贼为挽救其在河南的颓势，又从东西战场调来些残兵败将，于是该区成为蒋军进攻合围的中心，全体干部群众，又迅速转入游击战争。从情况发生到缓和，共二十一天，在县书联席会上，总结这二十一天的游击战争经验，主要是武装斗争、情报工作、依靠群众，三者结合的好，因此胜利的坚持了腹地斗争，开展了工作。并明确指出：坚持斗争的主要障碍，仍是右倾退缩思想。总结中指出：这段游击战争是有很多成绩和创造的，大部分地区坚持了斗争，打击了敌人，保卫了群众利益。首先在武装斗争上，出现了很多模范典型，如临泽大队，在紧急情况下，以排为单位分散，深入腹地，给区村干部与群众以及时撑腰，坚持斗争。敌人大队过后，即集中活动，打击还乡团。在二十余天中，打了十六次仗，只郑营战斗，大队结合民兵，即完全歼灭义和庄伪区部，毙伤敌四、五十名。在我积极活动打击下，还乡团即没有撑开摊，群众也未受到还乡团的危害。在分散武装斗争上，更有不少的范例，如临泽三区分委书记边鲁吉同志，自带十三个民兵，打垮二百余还乡团。郓巨七区民兵英雄马广安，在引马集为五军也不可怕。更有郓城四区尹道双同志，在其他干部退出后，独自带起七个民兵，积极坚持了斗争。郓北五区干部结合民兵，靠近敌人一、二里地积极活动。三区干部结合民兵，坚持的也很好。县大队在敌人风头上灵活转移，出其不意，攻其不备，又在敌尾后打击敌人。郓城四、五、八区都坚持的很好，其他县这些好的例子还很多。这些活的斗争榜样，打破了某些人认为分散的小股武装不能坚持，集中又不能对付敌人的错误观点。第二是依靠群众，坚持腹地斗争，提高了干部相信群众的观念，如郓北县长马达同志，带一部分干部坚持梁山一带几个区的斗争，上午在高粱地隐蔽，下午进村工作。三、一、五区均得以坚持工作。他们都受到群众热烈的拥护，自动送水送饭、作情报侦察。六区分委会，在紧急情况未来前，召开干部会、民兵会，研究形势，打通了依靠群众坚持地区的思想，并对群众展开广泛的宣传工作，群众对形势有了正确的认识，他们说：“大河水少了，小河水就快干了！”（指蒋军大势已去），所以在紧急情况到来时，全区干部群众，都无慌乱现象。郓城四区干部，白天给群众砍高粱，晚上又进村工作。五、六区都是在紧张的游击战争中进行了土地改革。这段游击战争，证明了凡是坚持地区，与群众同生死共患难，保卫群众利益者，都受到群众热烈的拥护，更加密切了群众的关系。凡是单纯隐蔽者，必为群众所不满。在腹地坚持斗争的干部，情绪经常高涨，完全打破了恐惧心情；而退却逃跑者，则挨饿受罪，狼狈不堪。第三是建立灵活广泛的情报工作，就是直接侦察与大众情报相结合。各县武装的坚持，都表现了这一点。以我们自己的直接侦察为骨干，再结合群众自觉自动的侦察情报工作，因此作到及时了解情况，掌握主动。
    以上三个问题，完全证明了在敌人占领后，我们的各种工作，是能坚持，而且亦获得了很大的成绩。这段游击战争，最严重的缺点，主要的是一部分地区和一部分干部的右倾退缩思想。他们被敌人所吓倒，×县一部分干部，右倾思想的具体表现：（一）认为群众落后，不可依靠；青纱帐对群众非常失望，面对着敌人控制群众的一套面前，表现束手无策，以为群众被敌人控制，就不能依靠了；没有看清群众的基本要求。（三）对情报工作无信心，认为无法搞情报，因此失掉了坚持信心。（四）打了仗没处去，也就不能打仗。（五）认为我大军过河，反引来了更多的敌人，虽然整个形势是好的，但在这个地区未变好前一点钟，也有死的危险。在这些错误的思想支配下，就只有在敌人统治面前，表现右倾退缩了。临泽×××同志说：“骑马吃烧鸡，骨头还不知扔到那块地里呢！”因而他单纯的在地里隐蔽，不积极进行工作。这些思想，是说明了不相信群众，没有群众观念，不能在任何情况下去积极克服困难，与群众同生死共患难。今后坚持游击战争，必须加强思想领导，要发挥全体干部坚持游击战争的自觉性，不解决这个问题，就无法胜利的坚持阵地，配合大反攻，把敌人打出去。但这是个艰巨的任务，必须发挥领导上决心深入的工作精神，深刻的发掘干部的真实思想情况，启发表扬其积极面，树立正气，提高为群众服务的观念。第二个突出的思想，是关于游击战争与土地改革的结合问题，认为已经土改发动群众的村子，矛盾越深，敌人到来时群众恐慌逃跑，不可依托。凡是没有土改的村子，矛盾少，反而可依靠。这是把土地改革与游击战争看成矛盾的东西，对我们的政策就发生了怀疑。因此必须深刻研究这个问题的根源所在，为什么土改后工作又不能提高？主要根源在以下几个问题上：（１）由于自己的右倾思想存在，因而就不能对村干和群众进行积极的思想教育，发动群众，依靠群众坚持阵地；自己的右倾思想与村干右倾思想的结合，乃形成右倾潮流，群众得不到支持和依靠，如何不恐惧逃跑呢？（２）没有正确的广泛进行时事教育。如果对群众进行正确时事教育，及时解除群众顾虑，并教育领导群众，把土改控制农村组织武装等一套工作做好，就能避免混乱，并能胜利的坚持阵地。但领导上缺乏这种思想准备，因之使我们有些有基础的根据地，也不能坚持了。（３）群众发动不充分，村干积极分子有的严重的脱离群众，群众不满意干部。在右倾思想支配下，是不可能从积极方面去认识与很好的解决这个问题的。（４）也有些表现了我们对村干积极的爱护不够，没有很好的对他们进行组织管理教育工作，与大胆的发挥他们的能动作用和力量。
