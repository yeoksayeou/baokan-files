　　Frost and Frost Damage
    Xi Fengzhou
    When the temperature drops to a certain degree, plants and other objects on the earth will become cooled due to heat dissipation. At this time, if the air temperature is below freezing and the water vapor reaches saturation, it will condense into very small ice crystals on the surface of plants and other objects. This kind of ice is called frost. Therefore, the frost seen every late autumn is directly condensed from water vapor. Moreover, the condensation of frost is roughly the same as dew, the only difference being the temperature, which is either high or low.
    Frost is very harmful to the growth of crops. Especially in the mountainous areas of the Taihang Mountains, the climate is much colder than in the plains, and various crops often die due to frost damage before they mature. If the area affected by frost damage expands, the losses are also very alarming. For example, in the Changzhi area last year, there was a sudden frost in early August of the lunar calendar, which damaged many crops, and the harvest of cotton, Golden Queen corn, and other crops was greatly reduced.
    Why are crops afraid of frost? Because when frost falls, the temperature drops, and the cold air also invades. The leaves and stalks of crops still contain a lot of moisture. When this moisture encounters cold temperatures, it freezes inside the crops, resulting in a lack of moisture in the crop cells, and after a certain period of time, the crops wither and die.
    This year, many late-autumn crops have been replanted in various places, and the autumn cold is earlier than in previous years, so frost is likely to occur earlier. Therefore, preventing frost damage has become a major task.
    In scientifically advanced countries, there are many ways to prevent frost, among which the simplest is the "smoke-smudging method." This method is currently being used in places like Pingshun and Huguan. This method of frost prevention has long been used in the north and has proven to be very effective, making it worthy of promotion and dissemination. However, this method of frost prevention needs to be carefully considered when implemented.
    When burning fires for smudging, do not concentrate them in one place; it is best to divide them into many small piles in the field. The more widespread the piles of firewood are, the better, and the more smoke they produce, the better. Pay attention not to let the firewood piles burst into large flames, as the smoke will be reduced if there is a large fire.
    The fuel used for burning can be general dry bark, rice husks, or withered grass, as long as it can produce a lot of smoke.
    Why can burning fires for smudging prevent or reduce frost damage? Because in general, crops are most afraid of sudden cold snaps during their growth. If the fields are smudged with smoke, it is like covering them with a layer of smoke screen, which can reduce heat dissipation. In this way, the temperature will not drop quickly, and the leaves and stalks of the crops will not be harmed.
    Frost prevention requires everyone's attention. In areas prone to frost damage, the smoke-smudging method should be implemented in a planned and organized manner, such as preparing firewood and designating frost prevention base points. When frost is predicted, a unified signal should be issued to warn everyone to take action and go to the fields to smudge.
    If weather stations or meteorological observatories could be established in the future, they could report to everyone in advance to prepare for frost damage when it is about to occur. However, at present, our region does not have this kind of scientific equipment in terms of agricultural meteorology, and we can only rely on our experience and eye observation to predict the arrival of frost damage.
    Generally speaking, in the frost season, if you look up at the sky during the day and it is a clear blue, it will definitely frost at night. If the sky has a bluish-gray tint, there may be frost that night. If the sky is gray with a light tint of blue (gray-blue), the possibility of frost is reduced. If the sky is entirely gray, there will definitely be no frost at night.
    Why is it that when the daytime is clear, there is more frost at night (autumn frost)? Because when a high-pressure system arrives, the weather will clear up, and the frost that condenses at night will definitely be more.
    In order to conquer nature and overcome frost damage, we should in the future regard the issue of frost prevention as being as important as preventing floods, droughts, wind, hail, and insect pests!

　　霜与霜害
    席凤洲
    温度如果降到一定度数的时候，大地上的植物和其他物体，就会因热力发散变成冷却的状态。这时，如果空气的温度在冰点以下，水蒸气达到饱和状态，便会在植物和其他物体表面上，凝结成很小很小的冰。这样的冰，就叫做霜。所以，每年晚秋见到的霜，也就是水蒸气直接凝结成的。而且，霜的凝结，大概和露差不多，所不同的，也只是在温度上有高有低罢了。
    霜对于农作物的生长，有很大的害处。特别是在太行区的山地，比平原地带的气候冷的多，各种庄稼常常因秋霜的灾害，还未成熟就死去。要是霜害的面积扩大，受到的损失也是非常惊人的。如去年长治一带，到了阴历八月初旬，就突然下了一次霜，把很多庄稼都打坏了，棉花、金皇后玉茭和其他农作物，减少了很大收成。
    庄稼为什么怕霜？因为下霜的时候，气温就降低，寒气也随着侵袭。庄稼的叶中、秆中还含着许多水分。这水分一遇到冷的气温，就在庄稼的内部凝冻起来，结果庄稼细胞中缺乏了水分，经过若干时间，庄稼就枯死。
    今年各地补种的晚秋相当多，秋寒又比往年早，下霜很可能要提前。因此，预防霜害，就成了一件大事。
    在科学进步的国家，防霜办法很多，其中最简便的，要算是“薰烟法”。现在平顺、壶关等地正在采用。这种防霜的办法，在北方早经用过，收效很大，很值得提倡与推广。但这种防霜的办法，在具体进行时，还需要加以注意。
    焚火薰烟，不要集中一起，最好在地里分成很多小堆烧，焚烧的柴堆越普遍越好，冒烟越多越好，并注意不要使柴堆大起火头，一有火头烟就减少了。
    焚烧用的燃料，一般的干皮、糠皮、败草等都可以，只要能冒出很多的烟就行。
    为什么焚火薰烟就能防止或减轻霜害？因为一般庄稼，在生长时候，最怕突然转冷，如果田地用烟薰薰，就象盖上了一层烟帐，能减少热力的散发；这样，就可以使气温不会很快降低，于是庄稼的叶子杆子也就不会受害了。
    防霜需要大家注意，在容易遭霜害的地区，要把薰烟的办法，有计划有组织的去进行，如准备柴草，划定防霜基点等。预测将下霜时，就放出统一的信号，警告大家，积极行动起来，各到地里去薰烟。
    假使将来能设测候所或气象台，遇到霜害快来时，就可以先报告大家早些防备。可是，目前本区在农业气象方面，还没有这种科学的设备，也只好凭着我们的经验和眼睛的观察，预测霜害的到来。
    一般的是，到了下霜季节，白天仰看天空，如果是青天一色，到了夜间必定下霜。如果天空带些青灰色，这夜也许会有霜。如果天空是灰色重青色轻（灰青色），有霜的可能性便少了。要是天空全是灰色，到了夜间决不会有霜。
    为什么白天晴朗、夜间就多霜（秋霜）？因为当高气压袭来的时候，天气就要放晴，夜间凝结的霜也必定多。
    为了征服自然，战胜霜害，今后应该把预防霜害的问题，看成象预防水、旱、风、雹和虫害等问题一样的重要！
