Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hubei-Henan-Anhui, 17th: The Dabie Mountains area has established seventeen patriotic democratic county governments. Under the leadership of the new political power, the people are enthusiastically launching a struggle for grain distribution, land distribution, anti-traitor retribution, and revenge. According to reports from various regions, as of the beginning of this month, the democratic county governments established in the border areas of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui provinces include: Guang (shan) Shang (cheng), Huangchuan, Shangcheng, Gushi, and Jingfu in southeastern Henan; Lishan, Macheng, Luotian, Yingshan, and Huanggang in eastern Hubei; and Lihuang, Luan, Huoshan, Tongcheng, Shucheng, Qianshan, and Yuexi in western Anhui, totaling seventeen counties. County, district, and township governments have also been established, and a large number of cadres have been assigned to go down to the villages to mobilize the masses. The democratic government, in coordination with the People's Liberation Army's mopping-up troops, is eliminating local tyrants and despots in various places; local snakes who have been slaughtering revolutionary masses for the past twenty years, such as Huang Guru of Jingfu and Gu Jingzhi of Shangcheng, have successively fallen into the people's net. Encouraged by the democratic government, the masses are in high spirits, with each gathering attended by more than a thousand people. In mid-September, at a mass meeting in Baiqueyuan, Guangshan, the number of men and women present reached more than 6,000. After the cadres went down to the villages, the masses revealed the crimes of landlords and bullies, and demanded to join farmers' associations; poor peasant groups sprung up everywhere like mushrooms after rain. At the end of September, in the Zidian area northeast of Macheng, when the masses were distributing the ill-gotten wealth of three local despots, including Hu Zhijin and Li Deming, Hu Zhijin himself was leading armed forces to threaten the masses on Maya Mountain, more than ten miles away. However, the masses ignored him and resolutely gathered, confiscating and distributing the ill-gotten wealth of the three local despots within three days. In various places in eastern Hubei and western Anhui, the struggle for the masses to distribute grain and ill-gotten wealth is in full swing, and the masses spontaneously put forward the slogan "Distribute grain in the autumn harvest and distribute land after the autumn harvest."

　　大别山区十七县人民建立爱国民主政府
    展开分粮分田反奸复仇斗争
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十七日电】大别山区已建立了十七个爱国民主县政府。人民在新政权领导下，正热烈展开分粮、分田和反奸复仇的斗争。综合各地报导，截止本月初旬，在鄂豫皖三省交界地区，建立民主县政府的计有：豫东南之光（山）商（城）、潢川、商城、固始、经扶，鄂东之礼山、麻城、罗田、英山、黄冈，皖西之立煌、六安、霍山、桐城、舒城、潜山、岳西等十七个县。各县区乡政府亦已成立，大批干部已分派下乡发动群众。民主政府并协同解放军清剿部队，将各地残留之土顽肃清；二十年来残杀革命群众之地头蛇，如经扶的黄古儒、商城的顾敬之等，已先后落入人民法网。在民主政府鼓舞下，群众情绪极高，每一集会都在千人以上。九月中旬，在光山白雀园的一次群众大会，到会男女达六千人之多。干部下乡后，群众纷纷揭发地主恶霸的罪行，并要求参加农会，贫农小组如雨后春笋到处发展起来。九月底麻城东北子店地区，群众在分胡之进、李德明等三家土豪的浮财时，胡之进本人正率领武装在附近十余里之马牙山威胁群众。但群众仍不加理睬，毅然聚会，在三天之内将三家土豪的浮财没收分配。鄂东皖西各地，群众分粮分浮财的斗争正方兴未艾，群众自动提出“秋收分粮、秋后分田”的行动口号。
