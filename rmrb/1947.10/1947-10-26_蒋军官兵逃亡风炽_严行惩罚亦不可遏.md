Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th. A set of Chiang bandit documents seized by the Northeast Democratic Allied Army in recent operations revealed the serious phenomenon of desertion among Chiang bandit officers and soldiers. The "Personnel Column" of the "Ministry of National Defense Report" Volume 2, Issue 7, compiled and distributed by the Chiang bandit Ministry of National Defense, published a "Roster of Names of Officers and Students Who Deserted from Various Military Organs and Units in February of the Thirty-Sixth Year." The number of wanted deserter officers and students reached 391, accounting for more than one-third of the pamphlet's length (from page 14 to page 38). The "Report" Volume 2, Issue 8, continued to publish the "List of Wanted Officers and Students Who Deserted in March," with the note "To be continued." The deserters ranged from general-level officers to lieutenant-level officers and soldiers, and the unit designations included their direct line main force to local teams, rear hospitals, transportation soldiers, aviation personnel, and military academies. The types of desertion were classified as desertion due to fear of combat, intentional desertion, taking leave to go elsewhere, absconding under false pretenses, not returning from official business, and absconding with weapons. Chiang bandit Ministry of National Defense's "Quasi-Military Service Section One Word No. 6380 Telegram" attempted to prevent desertion by means of "officer-soldier joint guarantee," stipulating "strict leave for soldiers, adopting a shop guarantee and joint guarantee method." It also stipulated "If soldiers desert, commanders will be punished jointly" clauses: If one soldier deserts in a squad in a month, the squad leader will be reprimanded; if five desert, the squad leader will be demoted; if five to nine soldiers desert in a company in a month, the company commander should be reprimanded or fined one-fourth of their salary; if fifteen to seventeen desert, a major demerit will be recorded; if twenty desert, two major demerits will be recorded; if this limit is exceeded, it will be "submitted for discussion." From this kind of punishment level, one can see the astonishing number of desertions among its officers and soldiers.

　　蒋军官兵逃亡风炽
  　严行惩罚亦不可遏
    【新华社东北二十四日电】东北民主联军于最近作战中缴获蒋匪文件一部，其中不少文件皆暴露蒋匪官兵逃亡现象严重。蒋匪国防部编发之“国防部报导”第二卷第七期“人事栏”内刊载“三十六年二月份各军事机关部队逃亡官佐生员姓名清册”一份，内被通辑之逃亡官佐生员即达三百九十一名，占该名册篇幅三分之一以上（从十四页起到三十八页止）。该“报导”第二卷第八期继续刊登“三月份逃亡官佐员生通辑名单”，且注以“未完待续”。其逃亡人员，上至将级军官，下至尉级官佐及士兵，无所不包，部队番号自其嫡系主力至地方团队、后方医院、辎重兵、航空员、军官学校等，应有尽有。其中将逃亡类分作畏惧作战逃亡，蓄意逃亡，请假他去，借故潜逃，借公差不归，携武器潜逃等等。蒋匪国防部“准兵役科一字第六三八○号代电”，企图以“官兵连保”办法防止逃亡，规定“严格士兵请假，采铺保、连环担保方式”。并规定“士兵逃亡，长官连带惩罚”条款：班内一个月逃兵一名，班长受申斥，逃五名者降级；连内一月逃五名至九名者，连长应受申斥或罚薪四分之一，逃兵十五名至十七名者记大过一次，二十名者记大过两次，超过此限者“呈请议处”；营以上规定亦同，不过每月起码数为二十名至三十四名，最高数为六十五名以上至八十名以下。从此种惩罚等级之规定，可以窥见其官兵逃亡数目之惊人。
