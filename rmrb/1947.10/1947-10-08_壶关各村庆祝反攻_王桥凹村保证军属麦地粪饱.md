　　Hukuan Villages Celebrate Counter-Offensive
　　Wangqiao'ao Village Guarantees Manure for Military Families' Wheat Fields
　　[Report from our Hukuan Office] After hearing the great news of the victory of the Liu-Deng army's southward advance and the start of the great counter-offensive, the liberated peasants of Liaoyang and other villages in the Third District, Hukuan County, immediately and naturally discussed and spread the exciting news of victory in the streets and alleys. The political director immediately convened a meeting of cadres to discuss and formulate a plan to hold a village-wide mass celebration meeting the next day (the 18th) morning. The meeting place was hung with magnificent portraits of Chairman Mao and Commanders Liu and Deng. Before the arrangements were completed, the masses filled the venue. After the political director talked about the victorious news of our four field armies, the Women's Federation first stood in front of the portraits of Generals Liu and Deng and said: "We women will make good military shoes, made especially strong, and send them to the front for you and the soldiers under your leadership to wear!" The men also proposed: "While the soldiers go to the front to counter-attack, we will first sow the wheat for the military families and the families of the militiamen and porters who are going south to participate in the war, harvest the autumn crops first, and plow the fields first!" Under the slogan of "Guaranteeing that military families and families of war participants have their wheat sown well and fertilized abundantly," Wangqiao'ao Village cut 25,700 catties of artemisia and accumulated 2,295 loads of fertilizer for the 14 military martyrs' families and families of war participants in the whole village, and 39.4 mu of wheat fields have been sown in advance. The cadres and masses of Guoqiang and Qiaotou villages in the Second District, in order to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible and complete the border payments ahead of schedule, the masses of Qiaotou said during the discussion: "We are paying this installment this year to eradicate the roots and eliminate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek cleanly, so we can have our good times!" In order to eliminate the Chiang bandits as soon as possible, the masses proposed to guarantee completion in three days, and as a result, it was completed in two days. The masses of Guoqiang also quickly organized to transport coal and completed the border payments in a timely manner. The peasants of Ziliangzhuang in the Sixth District actively expanded the militia, preparing to participate in the war to eliminate the Chiang bandits. Their slogan is: "Expand the militia and armed forces, and completely eliminate the Chiang bandits!" Retired soldier Qin Fuquan was the first to sign up, followed by twenty-five liberated young people who joined the militia. (Hukuan Office)
