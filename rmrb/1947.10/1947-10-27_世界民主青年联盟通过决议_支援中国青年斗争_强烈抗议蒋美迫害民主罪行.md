Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Late report: The World Federation of Democratic Youth, with 48 million members from 57 countries, held its second council meeting (formerly translated as executive committee meeting) in Prague, Czech Republic, from August 21st to 30th. Eighty-seven council members from countries including China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Czechoslovakia, Korea, and Vietnam attended. The meeting passed many important resolutions, including the "Resolution on China" as follows:

"This council recognizes the serious situation faced by Chinese youth, whose national independence, peace, and democracy are endangered by the civil war waged by the Kuomintang government, supported by the United States, throughout the country. Young Chinese democrats are being arrested, persecuted, and even assassinated. In response, the WFDY expresses its full support for the heroic struggle of Chinese youth.

In order to strengthen the forces of Chinese youth fighting for peace and democracy, the congress believes that it is necessary for all democratic youth around the world to express their unity of action, and therefore decides to take the following actions:

First, strongly protest the Kuomintang government's arrest, persecution, and even assassination of Chinese democratic youth, as well as its policy of tearing apart the country's peace and threatening world peace through civil war. Further demand that the Kuomintang government immediately release all arrested democratic youth, cease its fascist terror, and guarantee not only that such terror will not occur again, but also that it will respect all the democratic rights of Chinese youth.

Second, protest the U.S. government's policy of intervention in China, and appeal to all American democratic youth to demand that the U.S. government cease this policy and immediately withdraw all U.S. troops and military personnel from Chinese territory.

Third, send a copy of the above protest to the United Nations.

Fourth, call on all democratic youth around the world to oppose the Kuomintang government's arrest, persecution, and assassination of Chinese youth, and to fully support the Chinese youth movement by all possible means, such as lodging protests with the Kuomintang government embassies in various countries, holding mass rallies and demonstrations, widely encouraging public sympathy, and writing letters and telegrams to Chinese youth, so as to improve the situation of Chinese youth.

Fifth, the WFDY is prepared to send a delegation to China in order to obtain the true situation of Chinese youth and their struggle."
