　　Ping Shun Seventh District
  　Studies Contracting Methods to Promote Autumn Plowing
    Tunliu Laozhuanggou Harvests and Plows Simultaneously
    [This newspaper, Ping Shun dispatch] The Seventh District, in order to further develop the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, convened a meeting of village chiefs and other cadres on the sixteenth day of the eighth month (lunar calendar) for a preliminary inspection. The entire district's grain has been completely harvested, and most of the corn has been harvested. 320 mu of land has been plowed for the first time, and a vigorous effort is now being made to rush the autumn harvest and autumn plowing. The meeting identified several specific issues: wage accounts in fertilizer accumulation had not been settled and cleared; the masses' old habits of not providing feed for cattle when plowing for the past few years, relying on morning grazing, resulted in less land being plowed, and the cattle also suffered, ending up with the land plowed but the cattle exhausted. Some cadres believed that last year, 50% of the land was plowed twice. This spring, when participating in the war effort, there was a shortage of labor. Plowing the land twice was advantageous; this spring, it was easy to catch seedlings and plant quickly. The masses knew that plowing several times was beneficial and felt that it was not a problem. Some households without labor and livestock were afraid of high wages and could not afford it, planning to plow only once. After discovering these problems, discussions were held based on the experiences of various villages in autumn harvest and autumn plowing to determine specific methods: 1. Large and small contracting: Large contracting involves making detailed calculations of the entire village's land, full and semi labor livestock, plowing and harrowing tools, etc. The land and labor livestock are divided into fixed shares. According to the amount of land in the entire village, the labor livestock are divided into teams. The cattle are fed at night, and the old habit of grazing cattle in the morning before plowing is abandoned. Each piece of land is assessed a fixed share. Plow the adjacent piece. If this piece is worth so many points, the group earns so many points. The method is simple and saves labor. Small contracting method: Regardless of night or day, contract the land by the piece in the fields, with a fixed share for each piece. Groups and teams in the entire village exchange labor, using a type of work ticket that circulates throughout the village. The above three methods must be under unified leadership, such as the organization committees in Anyang and Heihu villages dividing the leadership. 2. Combination of autumn harvest and autumn plowing. Villages such as Zhaocheng and Xingcheng proposed "yellow one piece, harvest one piece, plow one piece." Each village set out a plan, generally within a month from the 20th day of the eighth lunar month to the 20th day of the ninth lunar month, to universally plow and turn the land twice throughout the district, completing all the plowing. Anyang, Jingdi, and other four villages also set a plan to plow the land three times. (Zhao Xi, Yong Xiang)
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 11th dispatch] Tunliu Laozhuanggou Labor Hero Chang Hongsheng's mutual aid group organized livestock to carry out autumn plowing. While Chang Hongsheng was harvesting beans, grains, corn, and other major crops, he also organized 27 livestock in the village to rush autumn plowing. In order to universally plow all the autumn land, the method of exchanging livestock labor was improved, with each livestock animal equivalent to three man-days per day, and half livestock equivalent to two. People plowing the autumn land were equivalent to one man-day plus two extra points per day. It has already begun, with each livestock animal plowing the land in the morning and threshing in the afternoon. Women and children use hand mills instead of livestock, saving livestock power.

　　平顺七区
  　研究包工法推动秋垡地
    屯留老庄沟一面秋收一面垡地
    【本报平顺讯】七区为了把秋收秋耕进一步的开展起来，于八月十六日（阴历）召开了全区村长等干部会议，作初步检查。全区谷全部收割完，玉茭已收割大半，垡下第一遍的地三二○亩，现正紧张突击秋收秋耕。会议上发现几个具体问题：在积肥中的工资帐未结算清理，群众旧习惯在几年来垡地时不给牛上料，依靠早上放，结果又少犁地，牛也受罪，地垡完了，牛也累倒了，两不打帐。有些干部认为去年有百分之五十垡了两遍地，今春参战时劳力少，垡两遍地都沾了光，今春又好捉苗又下种快，群众都知道多垡几遍有利，感到不成问题。有些没劳畜力的户，还怕工资高出不起，只计划垡一遍等问题。发现后，根据各村秋收秋耕中的经验展开讨论，确定具体的办法：一、大小包工：大包工是把全村的土地，全半劳畜力，犁耕耙等工具，作详细计算，地劳畜力都做了死分，按全村地多少，把劳畜力按组队划分，牛黑夜上料，一早犁地打破放牛旧习惯。把每块地都评了死分，挨着垡，垡了下块垡上块，此地是多少分，赚多少分，那组垡了那组赚，办法又简单又能多省工。小包工办法：不管黑夜白天，到地里按块包工，就这一块地作了死分。全村的组与组队与队变工，使用一种工票，全村流通。以上三个办法，必须统一领导，如安阳、黑虎等村，组织委员会分工领导。二、秋收秋耕的结合。赵城、杏城等村提出“黄一块、割一块、垡一块”。各村订出计划，一般在阴历八月二十日至九月二十日一月内，全区普遍犁翻两遍，全部完成垡地。安阳、井底等四村，还订垡三遍地计划。（召喜、永祥）
    【本报太岳十一日电】屯留老庄沟劳动英雄常宏胜互助组，组织畜力进行秋垡地。常宏胜在一面收割豆、谷、玉茭等主要庄稼，另一面组织了全村二十七个牲口突击秋垡地，为了把全部秋地普遍垡过，提高畜力变工办法，全畜力一天顶三个人工，半畜力顶两个，垡秋地的人一天顶一工又加工二分，现已开始，每个牲口都是上午垡地下午碾场，妇女儿童推碾磨不用牲口，节省畜力。
