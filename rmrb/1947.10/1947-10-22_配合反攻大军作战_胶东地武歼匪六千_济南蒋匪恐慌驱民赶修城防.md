Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th—In the ten days from September 30th to the 9th of this month, local armed forces and militia of various military sub-districts in Jiaodong eliminated a total of 4,156 enemies, of which 2,183 were captured alive. They recovered and forced the retreat of 15 large and small strongholds, including Muping, Changyi, and Hanting, 20 miles southwest. They seized two 82mm mortars, three light and heavy machine guns, and two grenade launchers, and coordinated with the People's Liberation Army to destroy 57 enemy vehicles.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th—The local armed forces and militia in Pingdu South captured more than 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek regular troops, police, and "Returning Home Corps" members in September. A certain company of the Jiaodong Military Region's directly subordinate blasting battalion, cooperating with the main force, detonated a total of more than 600 landmines and hand grenades in front of the阵前, killing and wounding more than 500 enemies in September.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th—The Chiang bandits in Jinan are rushing to repair city wall defense works, driving tens of thousands of citizens daily to build two moats in the suburbs, stipulated to be eight meters wide, six meters deep, and 55 li in total length. Everywhere they pass, civilian houses, graves, crops, etc., are all destroyed. The method of apportioning labor is calculated according to the capital of businesses, the rooms of households, and the fields of farmers. Those who cannot provide labor are forced to pay money instead, with each household burdened with as much as tens of millions of yuan or more. The panic of the Chiang bandits in Jinan is a powerful satire of the series of "Shandong victories" fabricated by the Chiang bandit's Central News Agency.

　　配合反攻大军作战
  　胶东地武歼匪六千
  　济南蒋匪恐慌驱民赶修城防
    【新华社山东二十日电】自九月三十日到本月九日之十天内，胶东各军分区地方武装及民兵共歼敌四千一百五十六名，其中活捉二千一百八十三名。克复与迫退牟平、昌邑西南二十里之寒亭等大小据点十五处。缴八二迫击炮两门，轻重机枪三挺，掷弹筒两个，并配合解放军毁敌汽车五十七辆。
    【又讯】平（度）南地方武装民兵九月份内即活捉蒋正规军、警察、“还乡团”等二千余名，胶东军区直属爆炸营某连配合主力作战，九月份阵前爆炸共响地雷、手榴弹六百余颗，杀伤敌五百余名。
    【新华社山东二十日电】济南蒋匪赶修城垣防御工事，每日驱迫数万市民于市郊兴筑壕堑二道，规定宽八米、深六米、全长五十五里，所经各地，民房、坟莹、农作物等全遭破毁。其摊派人工办法，商号按资本，住户按房间，农民按田亩计算，无工可出者，迫令以款作抵，每户负担有多至千万元以上者。济南蒋匪的恐慌，恰为蒋匪中央社制造一连串“山东胜利”之有力讽刺。
