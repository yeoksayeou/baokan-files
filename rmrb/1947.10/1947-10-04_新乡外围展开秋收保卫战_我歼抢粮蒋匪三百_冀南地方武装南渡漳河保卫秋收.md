　　[Taixing Dispatch, this newspaper, 2nd] The battle to protect the autumn harvest around Xinxiang has officially begun. The 364th Regiment of the 122nd Brigade of the 41st Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits stationed in Huixian County, along with the entire Huixian County puppet security regiment, and the Xinxiang puppet security regiment, the puppet Hebei Security Corps, etc., under the personal command of Li Zhimin, Chief of Staff of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' 41st Division, launched an attack on the 20th morning in three routes. One route attacked Mengzhuang along the Wei River to the south, and the other two routes attacked Zhaogu Town and Jiang Yaogu in the west, plundering the autumn harvest by force. Our army blocked the enemy along different routes and annihilated one platoon each of the 364th Regiment of the 122nd Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the 12th Corps of Hebei Security, as well as the entire Huixian Security Regiment. More than 100 enemies were killed or wounded, including Qin Shouying, deputy head of the Huixian Security Regiment, and more than 200 enemies were captured alive, including a battalion commander and below. The captured items included two mortars, one heavy machine gun, eleven light machine guns, and more than 200 rifles and horses. After suffering this devastating blow, the attacking Chiang Kai-shek bandits shrank back into the city walls of Huixian.
　　[News from this newspaper] The enemies in Xiuwu began a frenzied grain robbery on the 18th of last month, mobilizing simultaneously towards the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th districts, grabbing everything they saw, even rags, smashing pots and bowls. In the Jiangcun and Mafang areas of the 2nd district, they burned some of the grain on the threshing ground. Our 47th unit, in the area of Wanhufu and Yanmazhuang, cooperated with the militia and working teams to repel the enemy, killing or wounding more than ten enemy soldiers, capturing four, and obtaining one rifle. Because the rice in the 2nd district was better, it became the enemy's main target for grain robbery. Our 47th unit transferred entirely to the 2nd district and put forward the slogan: "Protect the rice to eat rice, and don't let the enemy rob it, so as to starve the enemy to death." In the Banqiao area, they ambushed the enemy and annihilated a platoon, obtaining one machine gun and three rifles. The enemy dared not leave Banqiao for two days. Our rear labor force helped the front to rush harvest. In three days, they rushed to harvest more than 300 piculs of rice. Now the masses in Shuizhai and Banqiao want me to fight the enemy and protect the autumn harvest. Under armed protection, the masses are rushing to harvest day and night in the rain, with great enthusiasm.
　　[Jinan Dispatch, this newspaper, 1st] (Delayed Arrival) Our local armed "Kaifeng" unit crossed the Zhang River on the 9th to protect the autumn harvest and wheat sowing of the masses in the border areas. On the 11th, the enemy diehards from the 40th Division of Anyang and the 1st Supplemental Regiment, led by puppet bandits Guo Qing and Wang Zijin, etc., scurried eastward. At dawn on the 12th, the enemy's 40th Division was blocked by a unit of ours, and another unit of ours detoured to the enemy's flank, attacking villages such as Xiacun, Wanglongmiao, Haoyu Temple, and Chenjiatang in succession. The enemy fled at the mere sight of us and retreated to the temporary stronghold of Hongcun. After our three-sided attack, the battle was resolved in twenty minutes. The enemy mostly fled westward in panic, and our army recovered the stronghold. In this battle, a total of two heavy machine guns, three light machine guns, two submachine guns, thirty rifles, nearly ten thousand rounds of ammunition were captured, and fifty-two enemy soldiers below the rank of platoon leader were captured.
