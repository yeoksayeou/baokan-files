　　Launching a Mass Anti-Landmine Warfare
    Eastern Xin Achieves Victory in Anti-Suppression
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 3rd dispatch】The Yan bandits, trapped in the isolated stronghold of Xinxian City in northern Shanxi, have since the beginning of July concentrated a force of more than 1,500 men to repeatedly "suppress" the wealthy Eastern Xin (newly established county, formerly eastern Xin County) liberated area, wantonly seizing men and grabbing grain in an attempt to make a desperate struggle. The people's guerrillas launched village-to-village joint defense and landmine and tunnel warfare, and sent teams to the enemy's rear to attack the Yan bandits from both inside and outside. On September 16, the guerrillas operating north of Xinxian City captured the Qincheng stronghold in one fell swoop, defeating more than 200 Yan bandits; on the 17th, they annihilated the entire replenishment training company of the 3rd Regiment of the 39th Division of the Yan bandits in the Paochi stronghold. At this point, the Yan bandits north of Xinxian were shaken across the board. The Yan bandits entrenched in places such as Beizhao, Shangshe, Ershilibu, Qianboming, and Houboming fled back to Xincheng in panic. After the guerrillas successively captured seven strongholds and killed, wounded, and captured 58 enemies, they took advantage of the victory to go south and attacked the enemy invading Eastern Xin from the flanks and rear. The masses in more than 20 villages on the edge of Eastern Xin, who insisted on resisting the "suppression" from the front, had as early as the beginning of July, under the leadership of the armed village government, formed groups to transfer the old and weak to safe areas, organized the young and strong to thoroughly clear the fields, and densely laid landmine arrays to block the invading enemy. The militia of Dingxiang County, a neighboring county, also came to support. In the struggle, the military and civilians shared life and death, and their deeds were moving. A village militiaman repeatedly repelled eight enemy attacks and was hailed as an "unbreakable people's fortress." The last fierce battle on July 13 lasted for 36 hours. At that time, more than 1,000 Yan bandits carried a mountain gun and launched a fierce retaliatory attack from dawn. The militiamen calmly resisted by defending fortifications and rooftops. When the enemy rushed into the center of the village, the militiamen simultaneously threw more than 30 hand grenades, and the landmines also exploded in unison. The enemy left many corpses and retreated in a panic. At night, the Yan bandits gathered the remnants and launched a counterattack, setting fire to the houses around the militia's position. The participating masses risked their lives to put out the fire and sent water to encourage the militiamen, saying: "Don't be afraid with us here." A woman saw the enemy cut off the landmine's pull cord, so she bravely passed through the smoke and fire to reconnect it. When the enemy pounced, the landmine exploded as usual. In the fierce battle until the next morning, the Yan bandits were killed and wounded 43 people (including 4 Japanese soldiers). They were defeated and retreated miserably, while the militiamen only suffered two minor injuries.
    District cadre Li Yinwang and others fought hard in an enemy encirclement in a village, without eating a grain of rice for three days and nights, and finally escaped safely under the skillful cover of the masses. A child of over ten years old in Shuangbu Village was unfortunately arrested. The enemy used severe torture to force him to reveal the location of the landmines. Seeing that there was no way to escape, the child led the Yan bandits into the minefield and took the opportunity to step on a landmine, perishing together with the enemy. When the masses spoke of it, they were all in awe and admiration. Thanks to the resolute struggle of the military and civilians as one, and the strong cooperation of the guerrillas in the neighboring areas of Northern Xin, the Yan bandits' plan to seize men and grab grain has now completely failed.

### 开展群众性联防地雷战  忻东反清剿获胜利

　　开展群众性联防地雷战
    忻东反清剿获胜利
    【新华社晋绥三日电】困守晋北孤立据点忻县城之阎匪，自七月初迄今，集中兵力一千五百余人，反复“清剿”富庶的忻东（新设县，原忻县东部）解放区，大肆抓丁抢粮，图作垂死挣扎。人民游击队展开村村联防和地雷、地道战，并派队绕至敌后，内外夹击阎匪。九月十六日，活动于忻县城北之游击队，一举攻克秦城据点，击溃阎匪二百余人；十七日复歼炮池据点阎匪三十九师第三团补训连全部。至此，忻县以北阎匪遂全线动摇。盘踞北赵、上社、二十里埠、前播明、后播明等地之阎匪，均仓惶窜回忻城。游击队于连克据点七处，毙伤俘敌五十八名后，即乘胜南下，由侧背攻击窜犯忻东之敌。坚持正面反“清剿”之忻东边缘二十余村群众远在七月初即在武装村公所领导下，编成小组，将老弱转移至安全地带，组织青壮年实行彻底空室清野，密布地雷阵，阻击进犯之敌。邻县之定襄民兵，亦赶来应援。在斗争中，军民生死与共，事迹感人，某村民兵连续击退敌八次进攻，被誉为“不可攻破的人民堡垒”。其七月十三日最后一次激战曾历时三十六小时，当时阎匪千余携山炮一门，自拂晓起凶猛报复进攻，民兵在固守工事及房顶沉着抗击。当敌冲入村中心时，民兵同时掷三十多颗手榴弹，地雷也一齐轰鸣，敌遗尸多具，狼狈溃退，入夜，阎匪又纠合残部反扑，并纵火焚烧民兵阵地周围的房屋。参战群众即冒死救火，并送水鼓励民兵说：“有我们在不怕。”一位妇女见敌剪断拉雷之绳索，即奋勇穿过烟火再结起来，当敌进扑时，地雷照样轰炸。激战至翌日晨，阎匪死伤四十三人（内有日军四名）。惨败而退，民兵则仅轻伤两名。
    区干部李银旺等，在某村敌包围圈内艰苦作战，三昼夜未进粒米，终在群众机巧掩护下安全脱险。双堡村一个十余岁儿童不幸被捕，敌以严刑逼其供出埋雷地点，儿童见无法可逃，乃引阎匪入雷区，乘机踏响地雷，与敌同归于尽。群众言之，莫不肃然起敬。由于军民一体的坚决斗争，以及忻北友邻区游击队的有力配合，阎贼抓丁抢粮计划现已完全破产。
