　　Kill More Enemies at the Front, Plant More Wheat in the Rear
  　Everyone in Xicui is Enthusiastic About Production
    [Our Newspaper, Shahe] Taking advantage of the rainy weather that prevented them from planting wheat, the masses in Xicui discussed the victorious news of our army's southern counter-offensive. In particular, when everyone learned that the Liu-Deng army was only 100 li away from Nanjing and even closer to Wuhan, and that the Chen-Xie army had occupied more than 500 li from Luoyang to Tongguan, everyone was extremely happy. Li Tong said, "The army is protecting us at the front, we can't be lazy in the rear. Let's be thrifty, save a little, and give the frontline soldiers better food. We must also cultivate the land of the military families well!" Zhang Guocheng said, "Our group will cultivate the land for the military families, guaranteeing to plow the land deeply, harrow it flat, and plant it well. We will plow and plant for the military families first!" Li Fengzhi, a military family member, said, "In previous years, I only harvested two sacks of wheat, but this year I harvested three sacks of wheat and four or five sacks of barley. When I wrote a letter to my man, he was very happy!" Yang Fan, the women's chairman, said, "When we harvested more wheat in the summer, I wrote a letter to my man and asked him to fight old Chiang hard. He wrote back saying that not only was he happy, but all the comrades in the company were happy. This autumn, there will be even more grain. We are using straw mats that we haven't used for eight or nine years. I'm going to write him another letter now, and when he knows, he will definitely be more energetic in battle!" At this point, the masses all said: In the future, we must give long-term preferential treatment to military families. This is supporting the front! Some said: Let's compete in planting more wheat in the rear and winning battles at the front. After the meeting, the slogans on the street were replaced with news of victories and slogans for the great counter-offensive. The primary school teachers are preparing to draw a large map, indicating the areas reached by the Liu-Deng-Chen-Xie armies and their direction of advance.

　　前方多杀敌后方多种麦
  　西崔人人生产带劲
    【本报沙河讯】西崔群众，趁着天下雨不能下地种麦，就对我军南下大反攻的胜利消息展开了讨论，特别是当大家知道刘邓大军离南京只一百里，离武汉更近，陈谢大军从洛阳到潼关占了五百多里时，大家更是高兴极了，李同说：“军队在前方保卫咱，咱在后方吃赖些，省俭点，多给前线战士们吃好些，咱还要把军属的地代耕好！”张过成说：“俺组给军属代耕地，保证把地犁深、耙平、种好，还要先给军属犁种！”军属李凤枝说：“我往常年只打两布袋麦子，今年打了三布袋小麦，还有四、五布袋大麦，给俺男人写去信后他可喜欢了！”妇女主席杨凡的说：“夏天打的麦子多了，我就给俺男人写信，让他好好打老蒋，他来信说不但他高兴，全连的同志都高兴，今年秋天粮食更多了，八、九年没使过的席圈，今年使上了，我现在还要给他写信，他知道了打起仗来准更带劲！”至此，群众都说：今后要长期的优待军属，这就是支援前线！有的说：咱在后方多种麦子和前方打胜仗竞赛。会后，街上的标语都换成了胜利消息和大反攻的口号，小学教员正在准备画一幅大地图，指明刘邓陈谢大军所到的地区、及前进方向。
