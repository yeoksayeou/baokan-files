Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd: In Jiaodong, local militia and armed forces actively strike against invading Chiang Kai-shek bandits, suppress counter-settlement despots, and support mass struggles. According to incomplete statistics for the first half of September, they killed, wounded, and captured over 1,200 enemy troops. When Chiang's troops invaded Pingdu East County, Yu Jianguo, a Jiaodong militia hero, led a militia explosion and shooting team to lay out a minefield forty miles deep along the Jiao (County)-Ping (du) highway from Sunjiakou to Beihemiao. On September 3rd, when the enemy invaded the county, the Maojiatun mine first exploded thirty-six times within five miles, causing the enemy to panic and advance in three directions. The team cleverly took advantage of this and lured them into the minefield. Explosions rang out everywhere, and the ambushing militia and armed forces seized the opportunity to strafe with machine guns, causing the enemy to flee in all directions. However, mines exploded everywhere, detonating if the enemy entered houses or even hid in the grass, resulting in corpses scattered across the field, with blood and flesh blurred on the walls and trees. According to Chiang's army deserter Li Zhang, he saw more than forty wounded soldiers with broken legs and arms being carried back south of Wujiakou alone. The Ping (du) South armed forces also fought five battles, killing, wounding, and capturing over 200 enemy troops, and completely destroyed the Gao (mi)-Ping (du) road. In Lai (yang) East County, male and female militia members enthusiastically participated in explosions under the county's call for "every village to sound with thunder," and more than 1,500 explosion experts have now been trained, laying mines everywhere to kill the enemy. Explosion teams composed of militia cadres are training male and female peasants along villages, launching a mass explosion campaign. A certain armed work team in Wei (County) South suddenly inserted itself into a village in the Zhangying district of the county with the force of divine soldiers, killing the local tyrant Yan Huifeng, who was coercing the masses to carry out "counter-settlement," on the spot. They pressed a bayonet to the neck of a secondary element, Yan Zhengxun, and taught him: "We won't kill you today. Go back and tell the surrounding landlords and bullies that anyone who wants to overturn the masses' victory and bully the masses will end up like Yan Zhengxun!" After the news spread, the masses became even stronger, and no one in the Zhangying area now dares to act as a Chiang Kai-shek保.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd: The Southern Shandong Military Region's troops, in coordination with county and district armed forces and work teams, took advantage of the Chiang Kai-shek army's westward advance and the resulting weakness of forces to launch a full-scale offensive in early August, sweeping through the mountainous areas of Zou County, Si (Shui), Tian and Yalu and both sides of the southern section of the Tai (erzhuang)-Wei (County) road. By early September, they had annihilated 1,632 enemy troops, disintegrated 350 enemy troops, and eliminated most of the Chiang Kai-shek "Homecoming Corps" and township 保政权 in the above-mentioned areas, forcing the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to shrink to the Jinpu Railway and the cities of Wei (County), Zao (zhuang), Qu (fu), Si (Shui), Pi and a few points and lines such as Chenqian and Baiyan. Two-thirds of the entire Southern Shandong area has been recovered by us, and we have controlled the Yitang to Xiaqiao section of the Linzi Road and the Xiangcheng east section of the Tailu Road, and the Liangqiu east section of the Linteng Road, totaling more than 600 li, shattering the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' attempt to fully control Southern Shandong with the Baojia policy and providing strong support for the land reform movement in various places.
