Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, urgent telegram on the 6th: On the Mid-Autumn Festival night (September 29th), the Jiaodong People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared behind the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Treading on the beautiful moonlight, they crossed the Yellow River and cut off the Jiaoji Railway in the middle. They swept through the areas on both sides of the Jiaoji Railway between Gao (mi) and Wei (xian), and successively captured more than 20 important strongholds of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, including ＠shan Station and nearby ＠shan Village, Zhuyang, Gaoyang, and Gaogezhuang (more than 30 li northwest of Zhuyang). They controlled more than 60 li of the railway from ＠shan to Tuxinzhuang section of the Jiaoji Railway, and annihilated more than 1,500 Chiang Kai-shek troops and "Returning Home Corps." On the 30th, part of the 45th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek troops hurriedly reinforced from Gaomi and was defeated by our army. On the same night, another unit of the People's Liberation Army also captured the Chiang Kai-shek stronghold of Huishan, just north of Pingdu, in a surprise attack, annihilating part of the 27th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, killing, wounding and capturing more than 200 people, and seizing seven light machine guns and one 60mm mortar.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, dispatch on the 6th: The Chiang bandits who ventured to attack Jiaodong advanced on Yantai in two routes on the 27th from Qixia and on the 30th from Fushan. The People's Liberation Army launched an outer defense battle in Guanshan, more than 30 li north of Qixia City, Zanggezhuang, more than 60 li west of Fushan City, Shushan, more than 30 li south of the city, and Jiaheqiao, 48 li from Yantai, annihilating more than 1,400 enemies. After the People's Liberation Army accomplished the task of annihilating the enemy, it voluntarily withdrew from Yantai City on the 1st of this month.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, dispatch on the 6th: The militiamen and local armed forces in various parts of central and southern Shandong have successively sabotaged the enemy's communication lines and attacked and blew up the remaining Chiang Kai-shek troops in isolated strongholds. The militia self-defense forces in Yi (shui)dong, Laiwu, Boshan and other counties have respectively sabotaged the Yi (shui) Meng (yin), Ju (xian) Lin (yi), Yi (shui) Lin (yi), and Yi (shui) Bo (shan) Lai (wu) highways, cutting off the connection between the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the above-mentioned strongholds. Two blasting teams in northern Yi (shui) fought 90 battles in one month. According to incomplete statistics from eight counties in northern Yi (shui), southern Yi (shui), eastern Yi (shui), Boshan, and Xintai in central Shandong, in August and September alone, a total of 679 Chiang Kai-shek troops (excluding the "Returning Home Corps") were killed or wounded, and 330 were captured alive. More than 100 Chiang Kai-shek deserters were found. In addition, a certain unit of the local armed forces in Mengyin raided the Jiang pseudo strongholds of Santangjiao and Lushan in the northeast of Meng (yin) city on the 25th of last month, completely resolving the four Chiang Kai-shek township offices, killing or wounding more than 40 of them, and capturing 29 alive. The Chiang Kai-shek rear base cadre corps in southern Shandong widely launched attacks during the anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaign to support the land reform of farmers. In September, a certain regiment killed, wounded, or captured 287 enemies in one month, and arrested 159 pro-Chiang Kai-shek despotic landlords and members of the "Returning Home Corps," who were handed over to the peasants for disposal.
