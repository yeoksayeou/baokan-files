    Experiences in Organizing the Masses in New Areas to Participate in the War
    Jing Shuang
    [This dispatch from Taiyue, 25th of this month] Yi County in Southern Shanxi was only liberated half a year ago. The masses' understanding of our army's policies is considerably less than in the old areas. However, this time, *thousand *hundred civilian laborers followed the army on a long expedition to Linfen, lasting as long as 45 days, and successfully completed their mission. This was mainly because the leadership promptly resolved some issues.
    (1) Resolving Ideological Problems: Because the masses in the new areas did not fully understand our policies and decrees, they initially developed thoughts of "five fears": fear of going to the front lines, fear of traveling far, fear of crossing the Yellow River, fear of long durations, and fear of being forced into military service. They thought of ways to shirk their responsibilities, just like when they were forced to serve the Kuomintang army in the past. After the leadership discovered these ideological problems, in addition to re-mobilizing and explaining, they also asked: "What is the difference between supporting the army today and supporting the Kuomintang in the past? If you are not at home, will the autumn harvest and planting be delayed? Can the army fight without our support? For whom are the Eighth Route Army fighting? If we cannot eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandits, can we live in peace?" After everyone freely discussed in small group meetings and large meetings, everyone's understanding became clear. Yan Qingfeng, a peasant who had been liberated in the First District, said: "Our Yi County was liberated too late. In the past, we did not understand the Eighth Route Army and were deceived by the Japanese, Chiang Kai-shek, and Yan Xishan bandits. We did not know that the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party were liberating us ordinary people. Now I understand. I am here today to carry a stretcher entirely for my own good life." However, everyone was still worried about the crops at home, fearing delays, and asked to write another letter to the government, requesting assistance with farming. At this time, the brigade headquarters read out more than a dozen letters sent to the civilian laborers by their family members in the rear, one by one. Everyone then realized that everything at home had been taken care of, and they happily said in unison: "Good, good! Never mind one and a half months, three and a half months is fine too. We will persevere to the end and not go home until we are ordered to by the higher authorities."
    (2) Cadres Leading the Way: First, County Magistrate Zhao Chuan took the lead and served as the Brigade Commander. Zhao Zhong, the head of the War Support Section, served as the Deputy Brigade Commander. At the same time, cadres took the lead in rescuing the wounded on the front lines in practical actions. Groups and teams challenged each other to competitions. The leadership promptly called: "Resolutely do not desert, abide by mass discipline, do not let a single stretcher be lost or damaged, see who rescues the most wounded, who helps the masses with production the most, and which group has the best public health and fewest illnesses," and other criteria. Yan Qingfeng's group in the First District was the first to respond, and various groups and teams immediately challenged and responded, launching a heated competition.
    (3) Commending Models: After the entire brigade launched a heated competition, there were models in everything, and heroes emerged every day. The leadership promptly commended and encouraged them, further enhancing everyone's enthusiasm. Therefore, various heroes and models emerged in this participation in the war. For example, when Zhai Weizhong and others were transporting the wounded, one of the wounded died midway. They covered the deceased comrade with their own quilt and placed him in a coffin. He said: "The Eighth Route Army sacrificed their lives for us ordinary people. Can't we even sacrifice a quilt?" Hao Naicheng from the Third District, while staying in the home of a target of struggle in Shangguo Village, An'yi, found a five-tael silver ingot and unhesitatingly returned it to the villagers. After the leadership promptly commended him, they called on everyone to learn from Hao Naicheng and launch a discipline competition. Liu Changsheng and Wang Jinyan from the Fourth District, in the battle of Yuncheng, only focused on rescuing the wounded. They did not pick up the millions of French currency that the enemy had dropped on the road. Someone asked them why they didn't pick up the money, and they said: "Our task is to rescue the wounded, not to make a fortune. We are civilian laborers of the Eighth Route Army, and we must also learn the Eighth Route Army's tradition of loving the people."
    (4) Cultural and Recreational Activities: Wartime life is very tense, but there is also spare time for entertainment, thereby educating everyone. During the 45 days of supporting the front lines and participating in the war, the political consciousness of the civilian laborers of Yi County generally improved a step. Yan Qingfeng, a special-class merit civilian laborer, said at the county's congratulatory conference: "During this support for the front lines, in addition to work, we also studied a *New Masses* and a *Worker-Peasant-Soldier*, and learned a lot about laws and policies." When they had time, they gathered together every afternoon for collective games, practicing martial arts, singing, clowning, telling stories, etc. Various activities were very lively, thus consolidating everyone's morale.

    组织新区群众参战经验
    景霜
    【本报太岳二十五日电】晋南猗氏解放不过半年，群众对我军政策的了解比起老区来尚有相当距离，但这次×千×百民工的随军远征临汾，达四十五天之久，胜利的完成了任务，主要是领导上及时解决了一些问题。
    （一）解决思想问题：由于新区群众对我政策法令不够了解，开始发生了怕上火线、怕走远、怕过黄河、怕时间长、怕让当兵等（五怕）思想，象过去给国民党军队支差一样，想法应付。领导上发现了这些思想问题后，除重新动员与解释外，又提出今天与过去给国民党支差有什么不同？不在家，秋收秋种是不是就会耽误了？没有咱们支援前线军队打仗行不行？八路军是给谁打仗的？消灭不了蒋阎贼我们能不能过安生日子？让大家自由讨论，经过小组会大会热烈讨论后，大家的认识明确了。一区翻身农民阎庆峰说：“咱猗氏解放的太迟了，过去对八路军不了解，受了日蒋阎贼的骗，不知八路军共产党是解放咱们老百姓的，现在明白了，我今天来抬担架，完全是为了自己要过好日子。”但是大家对自己家里的庄稼仍是不放心，怕耽误了，要求再给政府写信，确实帮助代耕，这时大队部把由后方各个民工家属给他们子弟寄来的十余封信，一封一封的读过后，大家才知道家里的事情一切都有人负责解决了，十分高兴齐声说：“好好好！别说一个半月，三个半月也没关系，坚持到底，上级没命令不回家。”
    （二）干部带领：首先是县长赵川同志，亲自带头，担任大队长。战勤科长赵忠，担任大队副，同时干部在实际行动中又带头上火线抢救伤员，组与组队与队又互相挑战竞赛，领导上及时号召：坚决不开小差，遵守群众纪律，不让一付担架丢了或坏了，看谁救护伤员多，谁帮助群众生产多，那组公共卫生好发生病员少等条件。一区阎庆峰组首先响应，各组各队继即纷纷挑战应战，展开了热烈的竞赛。
    （三）表扬模范：全大队展开热烈的竞赛后，事事有模范，天天出英雄，领导上及时表扬鼓励，更加提高大家积极性，所以在这次参战中，涌现出各种各样的英雄模范。如翟维中等转运伤员时，伤员中途牺牲了，把自己的被子给牺牲的同志盖好，放在棺材里，他说：“八路军为咱老百姓牺牲了性命，我们还牺牲不起一条被子？”三区郝乃成在安邑上郭村，住在一个斗争对象家里，拾了一个五两重的元宝，毫不迟疑的送还该村群众。领导上抓紧表扬后，又号召学习郝乃成，展开纪律竞赛。四区刘长胜、王进演二人，在运城战斗中只顾抢救伤员，敌人丢在路上的几百万法币没有拾，有人问他们为什见钱不拾，他们说：“我们的任务是抢救伤员，而不是发洋财，咱是八路军的民工，也要学八路军爱民的传统。”
    （四）文化娱乐工作：战争生活是很紧张的，但也有空余时间可以进行娱乐，并由此对大家进行教育。在四十五天的支前参战中，猗氏民夫的政治觉悟普遍提高了一步。特等参战功臣阎庆丰，在县里的贺功大会上说：“我们这次支援前线，除工作外，还学习了一本新大众一本工农兵，了解了不少的法令政策。”有时间他们每天下午结合起来进行集体游戏，打国术、唱歌、出洋相、讲故事等，各种活动搞得非常热闹，因此巩固了大家情绪。
