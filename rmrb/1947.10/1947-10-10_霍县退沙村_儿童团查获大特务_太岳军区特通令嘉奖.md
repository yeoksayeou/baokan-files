  　Taiyue Military Region Issues Special Order for Commendation
    [This newspaper Taiyue 7th dispatch] Hou Jingbo, the chief of special agents from Quwo and Yicheng, and the current special agent battalion commander of Yan's 61st Army, was uncovered by the Children's Corps of Tuisha, Huo County. During the Anti-Japanese War, bandit Hou, under the orders of Yan, engaged in special agent activities in the Jicheng and Quwo areas, brutally murdering countless anti-Japanese cadres and farmers. After the surrender of the Japanese寇, he was reassigned as the special agent battalion commander of Yan's 61st Army. This time, when the 34th Army invaded from the south, fearing annihilation by our forces, they first sent a portion in disguise southward to infiltrate the Linfen area and assist the southern invasion. However, several dozens of them were successively apprehended by us. Bandit Hou was one of them, captured on the 1st of this month in Tuisha Village, north of Huo County. His adjutant, Cui Baizhou, and others were also captured by the self-defense forces. Upon learning of this, the leaders of the Taiyue Military Region issued a special order for commendation and allocated a bonus of 20,000 yuan as encouragement.
