　　Sweet and soft sweet potatoes, plant more to survive famine!
　　Remember to Select and Keep Sweet Potato Mothers
　　The proper name for sweet potato is "ganshu." In the area along the Pinghan Railway in western Hebei, it is commonly known as "hong shanyao" (red yam). Its tubers are rich in starch, and in both normal and famine years, they can be used as a substitute for steamed buns, as a staple food. The leaves are also edible. In a certain area of Henan, there was a saying: "Sweet potatoes are sweet, sweet potatoes are soft, plant more sweet potatoes to survive famine. Sweet potatoes are red, sweet potatoes are long, harvest more sweet potatoes to replace food." This shows that sweet potatoes are a very good famine-relief crop.
　　This year, in the area along the Pinghan Railway, many people have begun to try planting sweet potatoes. In places like Shahe, Neiqiu, Xingtai, and Lincheng, the small plots of sweet potato land that were experimentally planted are more than in previous years. In the Zanhuang area, sweet potatoes were already widely planted. Last year, due to favorable rainfall, both good and bad land yielded relatively high harvests. People calculated that growing sweet potatoes was very worthwhile. Therefore, this year's planting area has greatly increased. According to interviews, in the plains area of the Taihang First Military Sub-district, people generally believe that large-scale promotion of sweet potatoes is necessary. If the leadership can organize and promote this in a planned way, the planting area of sweet potatoes next year will inevitably increase.
　　The promotion of sweet potatoes is necessary because of their high yield and many characteristics: In ordinary sandy soil, the general yield is often more than 2,000 catties per mu. Fertile land yields even more. Even soil with poorer quality can be planted. However, in terms of climate, warm areas should be chosen. Sweet potatoes are different from potatoes. For example, in the cold mountainous areas of the Taihang region, planting potatoes is feasible, but planting sweet potatoes is not. In the hotter climate of the Pinghan Railway, planting sweet potatoes is feasible, but planting potatoes yields poor harvests.
　　In addition, drought resistance, wind resistance, and hail resistance are the most significant characteristics of sweet potatoes' resistance to natural conditions. Because this area often suffers from drought, choosing drought-resistant crops is a major concern. According to the general situation in current drought years, even if other crops yield only a little, sweet potatoes can still achieve a considerable yield (of course, with sufficient rainfall, the yield is higher). According to this year's situation, the first half of the year was very dry, but many sweet potatoes planted in dry land still grew reasonably well. Many people said: "As long as next year is not very dry, planting sweet potatoes will definitely yield more."
　　People who have grown sweet potatoes for a long time will personally experience that sweet potatoes have strong wind resistance. Because the vines of sweet potatoes are prostrate on the ground, even if there are storms during the growing season, they will not be blown down or broken like other crops. Moreover, sweet potatoes are also very resistant to hail. This year, because many areas experienced hail, although the leaves of sweet potatoes were damaged, they regenerated in a few days. This shows that sweet potatoes have strong "regenerative power" and are also resistant to hail. Sweet potato diseases and pests are relatively few. The planting time is also quite long. In addition to spring planting, it can also be planted after wheat. Although a lot of wheat was planted this year, it does not hinder planting sweet potatoes next year.
　　In order to promote sweet potatoes smoothly, some specific issues need to be resolved in the preparation work: such as which areas are suitable for planting sweet potatoes, and the quality of the soil, all need to be researched and investigated in advance, and everyone's understanding needs to be clarified, and mental preparations should be made early. Early spring sweet potato seedling cultivation is also very important. This year, some areas wanted to plant more, but they didn't know how to cultivate seedlings. If this problem cannot be solved well, difficulties will arise in the promotion work. In the past, cooperatives in various places have made many achievements in solving the seed problem for the masses. In the future, solving the sweet potato seedling problem is best done through cooperatives organizing the masses. If the masses are not worried about sweet potato seedlings, as for how to cultivate, manage, and store them, as long as the relatively mature experience of various places is organized and disseminated, everyone can quickly accept and master it.
　　Now sweet potatoes are beginning to be harvested. In order to lay the foundation for promoting sweet potatoes next year, attention should be paid to selecting and retaining sweet potato mothers to facilitate early spring seedlings next year. (Feng Zhou)

　　红薯甜又绵，多种红薯渡荒年！
  　注意选留红薯母
    红薯的正名叫甘薯，在冀西平汉线一带，俗称为红山药，它的块根中，含有丰富的淀粉质，平常年和荒年，全可顶馍馍，当饭吃。叶子也好吃。在河南某地曾有这样的谚语：“红薯甜，红薯绵，多种红薯过荒年。红薯红，红薯长，多收红薯顶食粮。”说明红薯是很好的渡荒农作物。
    今年在平汉线一带，不少群众开始试种了红薯，在沙河、内邱、邢台、临城等地，试种的小块红薯地却比往年多了。在赞皇一带，原来种红薯就很多，去年因雨水调和，好地和坏地，收成都相当高，群众算起来种红薯很合算，因此，在今年的栽种面积上，大大的增加了。另据访问结果，在太行一分区的平原地带，群众都认为大量推广红薯是必要的，领导上如能加以有计划的组织的去推广，明年红薯的栽种的面积，亦必然增加。
    红薯所以有推广的必要，是因为产量大和表现着许多特点：在普通的砂质土壤中，一般产量每亩多在两千余斤，肥沃土地，产量更高，就是土质较坏些也可栽种。不过在气候上应选择温热地区，因红薯和山药蛋不同，例如在太行区气候较冷的山地，种山药蛋行，种红薯就不行；在气侯较热的平汉线，种红薯行，种山药蛋就收成差。
    此外抗旱、抗风、抗冰雹，是红薯抵抗自然条件最显著的特点：因本区常闹旱灾，选择抗旱作物是件大事，据现在一般旱年，其他庄稼只要收一点，红薯也能得到相当的产量（当然雨水充足了产量高），按今年的情形，前半年是很旱的，可是很多旱地栽种的红薯，长的还不算很坏，不少群众说：“明年只要不很旱，种红薯一定收更多”。
    久种红薯的人，都会亲身体验到红薯抗风力很强。因红薯的蔓子是匍匐在地面上的，在生长期中，即有暴风吹刮，也不会象其他庄稼一样刮倒刮折。而且红薯抵抗冰雹也是很强的，今年因不少地区下了冰雹，红薯的叶子虽然也被打了，但不到几天，又滋生上来，这说明红薯的由于“再生力”强，抗雹力也强。红薯病害和虫害都较少。在栽种时间上也相当长，除春地栽种外，还可种麦茬。今年虽然多种了麦，并不妨碍明年种红薯。
　为了使红薯很顺畅的推广，在准备工作中需要解决一些具体问题：如那些地区适合栽种红薯，以及土质的好坏，事前都需要加以研究和调查，并使大家在观念上明确起来，早作思想准备。红薯早春薰秧也很重要。今年有些地区本想多种一些，但不会薰秧，这个问题如果不能很好解决，在推广工作上就要发生困难。过去各地合作社，给群众解决种子曾做出不少成绩，将来解决红薯秧也最好通过合作社组织群众去做。如果群众不发愁红薯秧，至于如何栽培管理、贮藏，只要把各地比较成熟的经验组织起来传播一下，大家就能很快接受与掌握。
    现在红薯正开始收获，为了打下明年推广红薯的基础，就要注意选留红薯母，便利明年早春秧苗。（凤洲）
