Carrying Water to Irrigate Seedlings This Spring
　Every Mu Yielded Four More Dou
　　[Report from Taiyue on the 22nd] Those who did a good job of drought prevention in the past are now having a good harvest. Duan Xiaosui, an old man from Huiqing Village, District One, Yangcheng, who was emancipated, responded to the government's call this spring when there was a drought: "Irrigate every mu you can, save every seedling you can." He took the lead in carrying water to irrigate two mu of corn, which motivated Yan Minfa's group to carry water to irrigate eleven mu of corn. Military family member Xu Dehe also irrigated six fen. Therefore, their corn did not have missing seedlings, grew tall, formed large ears, matured early, and had full kernels. Each mu yielded nine dou, and they harvested early to plant wheat. The unirrigated corn had sparse ears, thin stalks, matured late, and had small kernels, estimated to yield only five dou per mu. Based on this calculation, Huiqing Village, with its more than 897 mu of corn, will harvest 350-360 shi less. The masses said, "Effort is never in vain. The corn is good and we can plant wheat earlier. It's truly making up for one season, and catching up season after season." During the drought, Lu Liujin and Zhao Qiyuan from Xizhang Village, Songwang Village, led the whole mutual aid group to carry water to plant corn, replanting eighty mu of wheat land with corn. Later, they carried water to irrigate it again and hoed it twice. It is estimated that they can harvest 70%, while generally replanted corn can only yield 40% or 50%.

　　今春担水浇苗
  　每亩多收四斗
    【本报太岳廿二日电】过去防旱好的，现在收成好。阳城一区会庆村段小随老汉是翻身户，春天天旱的时候，他响应政府号召，“浇一亩有一亩，救活一苗算一苗”，首先担水浇了二亩玉茭，推动了延敏发一组担水浇玉茭十一亩，军属徐德和也浇了六分，所以他们的玉茭不缺苗，长的高，穗子结的大，熟得早，籽儿饱，一亩打九斗，早早就割了种上茬麦。没浇的玉茭穗子长的稀，杆子细，熟得迟，籽儿小，估计一亩只能打五斗。以此计算，会庆全村八百九十七亩多玉茭，就少收三百五六十石。群众说：“工夫没有枉下的，玉茭又好又能早种麦，真是一季赶上，季季赶上。”宋王村西章庄闾刘紧与赵启元，天旱时领导全互助组担水点种玉茭，把八十亩麦地都回种成玉茭，后来又担水浇了一遍，锄了两遍，估计可收七成，而一般回茬玉茭只能收四成或五成。
