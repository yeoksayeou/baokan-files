　　[This newspaper, Shahe News] Nanwang began harvesting on the eighth of this month, and after ten days, most of the harvest was completed, leaving only a portion of the late crops to be harvested. At a village-wide meeting on the evening of the 18th, when the news of the victorious counter-offensive of the southward-bound army was read out, everyone happily said: "Great! They've attacked Chiang Kai-shek's lair, Chiang Kai-shek is about to be finished." Everyone unanimously proposed that Nanwang should launch a crash planting of wheat and have a great competition with the front lines: the front expands the liberated areas, we expand the wheat fields; the front kills more Chiang Kai-sheks, we plant more seasonal wheat, and use practical actions to support the front lines. Women's Director Shi Huizhi proposed: Our village has few livestock, let's go back and mobilize women to push the millstones and grindstones, saving the livestock for plowing and sowing the land. Wei Changgeng said: "The soldiers on the front lines fight Chiang's bandits day and night, let's go back and mobilize the team members to plow the land during the day and deliver manure to the fields and dig up sorghum at night." Militia Captain Liu Jinshan said: "Last year we planted wheat too late, and my three mu of land yielded nine dou less, and it cost three sheng of wheat seeds. This year we have to plant early. If our whole village plants four or five hundred mu of wheat, planting ten days late will cost half a sheng more of wheat seeds per mu, which is twenty-two shi and five dou more. Each mu will yield one dou less. If we speed up and plant early, we can harvest four or five hundred more shi of wheat to support the front lines. Finally, Shi Qunbao and Liu Chunsuo, who are skilled at plowing, and Wei Xide, Liu Jinliang, Liu Hairu, and Liu Gaide, who are skilled at sowing, were selected to guide the village in plowing and sowing. Each team leader will go back to select skilled workers to specialize in plowing and sowing, and it was proposed that cadres take the lead in planting good wheat seeds like awnless wheat, gourd heads to increase yields.

　　[This newspaper, Yushe News] Farmers in various villages in Yushe County, in order to overcome the difficulties of the period between the exhaustion of the old crop and the harvesting of the new crop next year, are expanding wheat fields, applying more fertilizer to increase production and overcome famine. They proposed "Wheat should be planted early, the earlier the better; planting one more mu of wheat means eating half a year of grain earlier." Farmers throughout the county are engaging in a tense and organized wheat planting campaign on their own land. The Qianzhuang wheat field has 965 mu. Under the leadership of the branch, it has expanded the wheat field by 11 mu and newly planted 355 mu of wheat field, all of which have been plowed three times. The whole village's wheat field has become brand new, and 768 mu of land has been left for sheep to lie on, which is the most in history. Tian Shanren, a liberated old hero from Liuquan Village, proposed "Planting wheat during the White Dew Festival saves eight he of seeds per mu," and led the entire village's work team to complete the planting of all 1070 mu of wheat field, and expanded 60 mu. The whole village of Wuyuan Village has unified leadership, with teams adjusting and planting according to the ridges and gullies. Women and children deliver meals, and with three or two hundred livestock, they planted 165.4 mu in five days. Old men, women and children launched a crash campaign to pick mung beans and dig yams to prepare for expanding the wheat field by 96 mu. Currently, farmers throughout the county are mutually adjusting and using labor and livestock through mutual aid teams, sending fertilizer and sowing seeds at the same time, and auxiliary labor is rushing to harvest the fields. According to statistics from only forty-eight villages, the original total wheat field was 28,149 mu, of which 20,432.5 mu have been sown, and 6,069 mu of wheat field have been newly planted.
