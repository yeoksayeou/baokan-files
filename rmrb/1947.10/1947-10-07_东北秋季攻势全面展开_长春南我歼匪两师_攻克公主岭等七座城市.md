Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th Urgent Telegram: The Northeast Democratic Allied Army's autumn offensive, against which the bandit chief Chen Cheng feels anxious day and night, was fully launched on the morning of the 1st with the force of a thunderbolt. Within eleven hours of the offensive's launch, the large army under General Lin Biao successively captured the county towns of Yitong, Xifeng, Faku, and Lishu, as well as the important towns of Jiangmifeng and Bamiancheng. In total, one division of Chiang's local army, one regiment of the regular army, and a portion of local rabble were annihilated. At 8:00 AM that day, the Democratic Allied Army's giant pincers from the east and west simultaneously extended to both sides of the Shenyang-Changchun line, launching a fierce attack on the narrow corridor occupied by Chiang's army. On the eastern front, our army first recovered Yitong County, over a hundred li southeast of Changchun, and Jiangmifeng, east of Jilin, capturing over 600 Chiang puppets. Liang Jiefang, nephew of Liang Huasheng, Chiang's appointed Chairman of Jilin Province, was also captured. Another unit on the eastern front recovered Xifeng County, over a hundred li southeast of Siping, and nearby strongholds such as Diaopitun and Bakashu, completely wiping out the 390th Regiment of the 130th Division of Chiang's 53rd Army. On the western front, one of our units, through a forced march of 160 li, surrounded Faku city, 150 li north of Shenyang, on the 30th of last month. An attack was launched at 6:00 PM on the 1st, and the defending enemy, the 177th Division (formerly the 7th Detachment of the Eastern Security Force), was annihilated in just one hour, and the city was recovered. Another unit in the west recovered Lishu County, over 30 li northwest of Siping, and Bamiancheng, west of Siping, on the afternoon of the same day. As soon as the Democratic Allied Army's offensive was launched, bandit chief Chen Cheng's military deployment was thrown into chaos. The defending enemy on both sides of the Shenyang-Changchun line collapsed at the first touch, fleeing at the mere sight of our forces. This crucial transportation artery of the enemy is now completely exposed. The new deployment of Chen Cheng, which Chiang and the US news agencies had been boasting about for a long time as being able to "withstand the Communist army's offensive," has been proven in the first encounter to be nothing more than "whistling past the graveyard" to embolden themselves.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 5th Urgent Telegram: The Northeast Democratic Allied Army Headquarters has just released its 11th War Bulletin, announcing the initial battle results of annihilating two bandit divisions and one regiment, and recovering four county towns within the first two days of the offensive. The bulletin stated that after the summer offensive, our army in the Northeast theater, after two months of rest and reorganization, launched the autumn offensive in mid-September. On the southern front, our army in the Jicha-Sui-Liao area annihilated the main force of the bandit 49th Army and the 22nd Provisional Division (minus one regiment) and part of the 50th Provisional Division of the 93rd Army, totaling more than 16,000 men, completing the first stage of the offensive. On the northern front, our army also launched a full-scale offensive on October 1st, attacking from the east and west, advancing aggressively towards the central and long-distance Changchun-Shenyang section of the Chiang bandit's heartland. From 8:00 AM on the 1st to 12:00 noon on the 2nd, after 28 hours of combat, our army swept across the area, annihilating the main force of the bandit 53rd Army, the 116th Division and the 390th Regiment of the 130th Division, and the entire 177th Division (i.e., the 7th Northeast Security Detachment), recovering four cities including Yitong, Xifeng, Faku, and Lishu, and many important strongholds such as Jiangmifeng, Bamiancheng, Yehezhan, and Wei Yuanpu.

On the eastern front, part of our army first recovered Yitong City and the important stronghold of Jiangmifeng on the morning of the 1st. Another part of the army divided into three routes, advancing rapidly towards the lozenge-shaped area of Kaiyuan, Xifeng, Yehezhan, and Bakashu, launching a day-and-night encirclement and annihilation battle, completely destroying the fortifications and bunkers in this area of over 100 li in length and width, annihilating the main force of the Chiang bandit's 53rd Army, the entire 116th Division and the 390th Regiment of the 130th Division, and capturing all its division and regimental-level officers, and recovering Xifeng City. On the western front, part of our army surrounded Faku with a forced march of 160 li, and after two hours of fighting, captured the city at 7:00 PM on the 1st, completely annihilating the Chiang bandit's 177th Division within the city. Another unit recovered Lishu and Bamiancheng and other strongholds. The defending enemy in various places all fled at the mere sound of the wind. Now our large armies on the east and west routes have once again approached the central Chang-distance road and the Beining line. Our armies cooperate with each other, launching a powerful pincer attack on the blood vessels of the Chiang bandits in the Northeast simultaneously.

Preliminary statistics of the battle results: (1) The entire 116th Division of the 53rd Army and the 390th Regiment of the 130th Division were annihilated. More than 1,570 enemy officers and soldiers, including Jin Zansong, the major general division commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division, and the 390th Regiment commander, were killed or wounded. Over 8,430 bandits, including Liu Runchuan, the 116th Division commander, Wu Hesheng, the division chief of staff, the deputy division commander (name to be verified), and the regimental commanders of the 36th, 37th, and 38th Regiments, were captured. The entire 177th Division of the local army, and other units, were annihilated, with a total of more than 440 enemy officers and soldiers killed or wounded, and over 2,400 enemy officers and soldiers captured. In total, more than 2,000 enemies were killed or wounded, and 10,830 were captured alive. (2) Four county towns were recovered: Xifeng, Lishu, Faku, Yitong. (3) 186 60mm mortars, anti-tank guns, and machine guns, 266 light and heavy machine guns, more than 5,000 long and short guns, more than 300,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 5,000 rounds of artillery shells, and countless other spoils of war were seized. Detailed battle results are still being investigated. (Attached picture)
