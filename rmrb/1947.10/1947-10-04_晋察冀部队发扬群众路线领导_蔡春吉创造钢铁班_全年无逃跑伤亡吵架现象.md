Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 29th -- The Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army recently held a typical report conference on consolidating the troops to exchange experiences. The conference recognized the 2nd Platoon of a certain machine gun and artillery company of the "Donghai" unit, the 4th Squad of a certain company of the "Pingyuan" unit, and a machine gun squad of the "Nanhai" unit as the most successful. The 2nd Platoon of a certain machine gun and artillery company of the "Donghai" unit is united and disciplined, with no desertions. Moreover, so-called "backward, mischievous soldiers" whom other squads and platoons cannot unite and manage can transform and progress upon being transferred to this platoon, and some have even been promoted to squad leader. The characteristic of this platoon is to adopt sincere and earnest methods of persuasion and education for soldiers who make mistakes or are backward. The platoon leader and squad leaders first criticize themselves for not educating the soldiers enough or for not assigning tasks clearly, and then point out the soldiers' shortcomings. The impact of this spirit of self-criticism is that problems can be resolved satisfactorily. The 4th Squad of a certain company of the "Pingyuan" unit not only has no desertions, but also has no casualties or sick personnel for fourteen months, and is full of vigor. Five soldiers in this squad have been promoted to squad leader. The machine gun squad of the "Nanhai" unit has fought in nine major battles over two years, with very few casualties and no desertions. The conference summarized the main successful experiences as follows: 1. Cherishing soldiers to the utmost. During combat, platoon and squad leaders do not rely solely on bravery and blindly shout "charge," but rather on wisdom and experience, and on improving tactics during peacetime, trying to reduce casualties as much as possible during wartime. Platoon and squad leaders can all lead by example, taking more care of new and backward soldiers on the battlefield. 2. Platoon and squad leaders are as close to soldiers as brothers, and they believe that backward soldiers can all make progress. They influence them and educate them through exemplary actions of enduring hardship before enjoying comfort, instead of punishment. 3. Military and political leaders are united, their work style is democratic, and they pay attention to listening to the opinions of soldiers.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 29th -- Frontline reporter Du Daozheng reports: Cai Chunji, the squad leader of the 4th Squad of a certain company of the "Pingyuan" unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Field Army, created a steel squad. In eleven months, there were no desertions, no casualties in nine battles, the entire squad was united, there were no quarrels, no one was punished, and no one was (sent to the hospital) sick. Cai Chunji came from a poor peasant background. Since joining the People's Liberation Army, his class consciousness has rapidly increased. He regards soldiers as his own brothers, proceeds from the perspective of loving soldiers in everything, and gives full play to the leadership methods of the mass line and the core leadership role of party members. In these eleven months, Cai Chunji's squad has experienced nine battles, including Caohe, Cangxian, and Gucheng, and has often been in an environment of continuous combat and continuous marching. The composition of the squad members is complex. In the first eight months, out of ×× people in the entire squad, the backward elements and those prone to desertion accounted for nine. Among them, there was even Zheng Erdan, the "notorious mischievous soldier" in the entire battalion. At that time, Cai Chunji had just become a squad leader and lacked experience in leading troops in combat. However, his high sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for the revolution gave him a very simple and correct attitude and method for fighting and leading troops.

    In terms of combat, he intensified training in peacetime. His squad got up before dawn to practice hard. In the early stages of training in February this year, his squad ranked first in the entire company and collectively earned a merit. During wartime, his squad built strong fortifications, making use of terrain and terrain features. He said, "Sweat more in peacetime, bleed less in wartime." In the nine battles, the fortifications of his squad were stronger than any other squad. During combat, he can also lead by example, leading party members to unite the masses, patiently educating new soldiers, and leading new soldiers in combat, truly achieving "charging ahead and retreating last," maintaining formation, maintaining a certain interval, maintaining absolute silence, observing battlefield discipline, and resolutely obeying orders to complete tasks. In the Xiaobaizhuang battle, the entire company fought with four times the number of enemies. The communication between the squad and the company was cut off, and the situation was extremely urgent. However, under the decisive command and encouragement of squad leader Cai Chunji, the entire squad calmly responded to the battle. New soldiers, backward soldiers, veteran soldiers, and party members retreated in an orderly manner, leaving a certain interval, with the latter covering the former. Finally, he single-handedly dragged a machine gun to cover everyone, safely withdrawing under the intense fire of the enemy within 50 meters, with no casualties in the entire squad.

    In terms of leading troops, he first leads by example, and mobilizes party members to endure hardship before enjoying comfort. He often says, "Party members should play an exemplary role, and should not regard hardship as a burden, but as an honor." Regarding backward elements and those prone to desertion, he said, "Our troops are all poor people, who is willing to be backward!" "As long as we educate them well, no one will fail to improve." Therefore, he adopted an attitude of not attacking, not satirizing, and not losing his temper, boldly trusting, boldly using, and adhering to the principle of influencing and educating. Even with Zheng Erdan, he understood his strange temper of "being receptive to gentle persuasion but not to harsh treatment," and chose him as the leader of the civil affairs team, mobilizing the entire squad to encourage him, welcome him, and not stimulate him. Second, he immediately rewarded any slight progress, making him more and more enthusiastic, finally turning from a mischievous soldier into an activist, and from a "discipline-breaking king" into a model worker. Two months ago, he was promoted to deputy squad leader. The great progress of the seven backward elements in the squad was all due to this leadership style. The transformation of backward elements, coupled with the exemplary role of party members, has meant that his squad has not had a single quarrel in these eleven months, has not punished a single person, and is full of an atmosphere of unity and friendship and a new heroic competition. Five of the eight veteran soldiers in the squad have earned merits and been promoted, and he himself has recently been promoted to deputy platoon leader.

　　晋察冀部队发扬群众路线领导
  　蔡春吉创造钢铁班
  　全年无逃跑伤亡吵架现象
    【新华社晋察冀二十九日电】晋察冀解放军某部，于日前特召开巩固部队典型报告会议，交流经验。会议公认“东海”部某机炮连之第二排，“平原”部某连四班与“南海”部一个机枪班为最成功。“东海”部某机炮连二排，全排团结紧张，从无逃亡现象。且在别的班排无法团结与管理的所谓“落后、调皮战士”，调到该排即能转变进步，并有提升为班长的。该排特点是对犯错误及落后的战士采取诚诚恳恳的说服教育办法，排长班长首先批评自己教育战士不够，或分配任务不明确，然后再指出战士的缺点，这种自我批评精神影响所及，有问题就能够圆满解决。“平原”部某连四班不仅无逃亡现象，且十四个月以来，无伤亡亦无病号，朝气蓬勃。该班战士已有五人提升为班长。“南海”部之机枪班两年作战，经过九次大战役，伤亡极少，且无逃亡。会议总结成功经验主要为：一、万分珍惜战士，作战时班排长不是只凭勇敢，盲目乱喊“冲杀”，而是凭智慧与经验，凭平时的战术提高，战时尽量设法减少伤亡，班排长均能以身作则，在战场上多照顾新战士与落后战士。二、班排长与战士亲如弟兄，并相信落后战士均能进步，以吃苦在前，享受在后的模范行动影响他们与进行教育，而不处罚。三、军政领导团结，作风民主，注意倾听战士意见。
    【新华社晋察冀二十九日电】前线记者杜导正报导：晋察冀野战军“平原”部某连四班班长蔡春吉创造钢铁班，全班十一个月来无一逃亡，参加九次战役无一伤亡，全班团结，无一吵架，无一受处罚，无一（送医院）病号。蔡春吉系受苦农民出身，自参加人民解放军后，阶级觉悟迅速提高，把战士看成自己弟兄，一切从爱兵观点出发，发挥了群众路线的领导方法和党员的领导核心作用。蔡春吉班在这十一个月中，先后经漕河、沧县、固城等九次战役，经常处于连续作战，连续行军的环境，班内成员成份复杂，前八个月，全班××个人，落后分子逃亡对象便占了九个。其中并有全营中出名的“老调皮兵”郑二蛋。那时，蔡春吉才当班长，缺乏带兵作战经验，但是由于他对革命高度责任心，和积极性，使他产生了极朴素的正确打仗带兵的态度和方法。
    打仗方面，他平时加紧训练，他班天不明就起床苦练苦学，今年二月初期练兵，他班在全连考了第一，曾集体立功一次。战时他班修筑强硬工事，利用地形地物，他说：“多流汗，少流血。”九次战役，他班的工事均较任何班强固。战斗时，他又能以身作则，带领党员团结群众，耐心教育新战士，带领新战士作战，真正做到“冲锋在前，退却在后”，保持队形，保持一定间隔，做到绝对肃静，遵守战场纪律，坚决服从命令完成任务。小白庄战斗，全连与四倍敌人战斗，班和连的连联络被切断，情况万分紧急，但在蔡春吉班长的果断命令与鼓动下，全班沉着应战，以新战士、落后战士、老战士、党员为先后顺序，离开一定间隔，作有秩序的撤退，最后他一个人拖一挺机枪掩护大家在距敌五十米达以内的火力密集扫射下，安全撤下来，全班无一伤亡。
    带兵方法，他首先以身作则，并发动党员吃苦在前，享受在后，他常说：“党员起模范作用，不应认苦而应认为光荣。”对待落后分子逃亡对象，他说：“咱们队伍里都是穷人，谁甘心落后啊！”“只要好好教育，没有变不好的。”因而他采取了不打击，不讽刺，不发脾气的态度，大胆信任，大胆使用，坚持感化教育的方针，即对郑二蛋他亦是摸着他“吃软不吃硬”的怪脾气，选他作民运小组长，发动全班鼓励他，欢迎他，不刺激他。二、稍有进步则马上奖励，使他愈干愈起劲，终于由调皮兵变成了积极分子，由犯纪律“大王”进步成模范工作员，两月前已升任副班长。二班上七个落后分子都是在这样的领导作风下大大进步了。落后分子的转变，加之党员的模范作用，使他的班在这十一个月中没有一次吵架，没处罚过一个人，充满着团结友爱的气氛与新的英雄主义竞赛，该班八个老战士中五个均已立功升级，他本人亦于目前升为副排长。
