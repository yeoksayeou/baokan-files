Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. According to a report by the correspondent of *Pravda* in Vienna: The problem of food for the residents of Vienna is becoming increasingly precarious. In the past two years, the cost of living in Austria has increased by 100 percent, and the threat of further inflation is rampant. Austria now has no food reserves. Before the war, the Austrian countryside supplied 75 percent of the country's food needs, but now it is entirely dependent on foreign countries. Although the workers have restored the factories, most of the textile factories are working, but there are no textiles on the Austrian market. The reactionaries in Austria are using the "hunger policy" as a weapon against the domestic democratic movement. They are unwilling to sell grain and daily consumer goods on the open market, and would rather use the workers' products to sell on the black market and exchange for foreign exchange for speculation. The Minister of Planned Economy in the Austrian government openly opposes planned economy, the Minister of Agriculture opposes land reform, and Foreign Minister Gruž openly takes pride in being a running dog of the United States in Austria. However, the Austrian workers have held demonstrations in the center of Vienna more than once to protest the government's policies, and the struggle of democrats against the remnants of fascism is growing stronger.

　　奥人民受饥饿威胁民主运动日益壮大
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据真理报驻维也纳记者报导：维也纳居民的吃饭问题正朝不保夕。过去两年奥国生活费用增加了百分之百，而进一步通货膨胀的威胁又甚嚣尘上。现在奥国毫无存粮，战前奥国农村供给国内粮食需要的百分之七十五，如今则全部仰赖于外国。虽然工人把工厂恢复了，大多数纺织厂在工作，可是奥国市场上没有纺织物。奥国的反动派把“饥饿政策”当作反对国内民主运动武器，他们不愿把粮食与日用消费品在公开市场上出售，而宁愿用工人的生产品去卖黑市与换取外汇来进行投机。奥国政府中计划经济部部长公开反对计划经济，农业部长反对土地改革，而外长格鲁日则公开以充当美国在奥的走狗而自鸣得意。但是奥国的工人们在维也纳中心已不止一次地举行抗议政府政策的示威，民主分子反对法西斯残余的斗争在日益壮大中。
