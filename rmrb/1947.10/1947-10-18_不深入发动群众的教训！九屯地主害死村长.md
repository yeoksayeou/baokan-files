Lesson from Not Thoroughly Mobilizing the Masses! Landlord of Jiutun Murders Village Chief

	En County's New Fourth District, Jiutun, is a small village with a very weak work foundation. The entire village has only over fifty households, located on the northernmost edge of the district. Comrades from the district rarely visited this village, so although it underwent a period of mass movement and review last year, the masses in the village remained under the rule of the landlord brothers Xia Zhaoxiang and Xia Chengxiang, and did not achieve liberation. The village chief, Wang Fuxian, was from a poor peasant background and a decorated veteran of eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. He was very active in village work, but because our leadership did not provide enough support, the masses were never able to rise up. However, the village chief had become a thorn in the side of the landlords, and he also saw through their game. When the poor peasant training was taking place, the village chief said to the district chief: "District Chief, please be careful. If I'm not careful, I might be killed by the landlord Xia Zhaoxiang and his brother in our village. When that happens, you must avenge me! They even invited me to drink at their place the other day to deceive me."

	During the poor peasant training, the landlords Xia Zhaoxiang and Xia Chengxiang seized the opportunity at home to conspire to murder the village chief. They secretly gathered their lackeys for a small meeting, including habitual bandit Xia Dian’san, instructor Xu Liancai, the new captain Xiao Cheng, the old captain Wang Baozhen, and Xia Zhaoxiang's son (all with backgrounds as bandits and hooligans). Xia Zhaoxiang, holding a wine jug, said to them: "Today we are gathered here to discuss whether we still want to live. If we want to live, we must quickly find a way. Now the village chief has gone to the district for training, and when he comes back, won't he want our lives? We must think of a way." They planned while drinking, and finally, according to the landlord's plan, they would first threaten the entire village with guns. When the village chief returned home, they would tie him up and say that the masses were settling accounts with him. They would shout a slogan at a meeting and beat him to death, and tell the district that it was the opinion of the masses.

	The poor peasant training ended on August 29th. On the morning of the 9th of this month, representatives of the poor peasants of Jiutun reported to the district that the "masses" had beaten the village chief to death; but their faces looked distressed. At this time, the district chief determined that it was the landlords who had done it, but when he asked the representatives, they only shed tears and dared not speak. The representative was the village chief's nephew. The landlord knew that the poor peasant representative's words to the district would have an effect, and he figured he wouldn't dare expose them to the district, so he threatened the representative and told him to report to the district. At that time, the district chief told the representative to go back to the village to gather the masses, and then went to Jiutun. As soon as he entered the village, he saw a crowd of people on the street. At this time, the landlord thugs saw the district chief from afar and threatened the masses with guns, saying: "Anyone who doesn't shout slogans, watch out for your heads." They led the way in shouting: "Welcome District Chief to uphold justice for us!" At this time, the district chief decided to deceive them for a moment, and at the same time see the real situation. When the district chief saw the village chief's bloody corpse lying in the middle of the crowd, although his heart was like a knife, he steeled himself and deliberately asked how the village chief had died. The landlord thugs said that the "masses" had beaten him to death, and asked the district chief to uphold justice for them. The district chief said that since the masses had beaten the bad guy to death, the government would definitely uphold justice for you. Bury him! The landlord thugs, seeing that the district chief had not seen through their trick, became even bolder, and took the opportunity to say that the masses really hated this kind of bad guy, so why bury him? Let's throw him into the river as soon as possible! The district chief explained to him: "Does he still have sins after he dies? Let's bury him!" Xia Zhaoxiang interjected: "He also has a younger brother, who won't be a good thing when he grows up. Let's kill them both and get rid of the root of the trouble for the masses." The district chief explained again: "Let whoever did it be responsible, don't implicate the child." Finally, the district chief announced to the masses that as long as 90% of the people agreed, the government would definitely uphold justice. The landlord thugs manipulated the crowd to shout slogans "Now the government really has eyes!" "The common people have reached the time to turn over!" After the district chief left the village, the landlord thugs thought their trick had succeeded, and were secretly happy. The villagers, however, returned home and secretly shed tears.

	The landlord thugs, the Xia Zhaoxiang brothers, had long anticipated that one day the masses would rise up and settle accounts with them, so they had prepared in advance. The north side of Jiutun is close to the canal embankment, and after the straightening of the river this year, this embankment became a natural stronghold surrounded by water on all sides. The two brothers built a house here, and they got two boats, one in the south river for their travels home. After they crossed over, they docked the boat on the north side, and people could not pass through the south side. They also arranged for a gardener to stand guard. He felt that this place was very safe, and the people gave it the nickname "American Territory."

	On the night after the district chief left, the two brothers returned to "American Territory" triumphantly, thinking that they were safe.

	After returning to the district, the district chief discussed the problem with the activists in the nearby villages. Finally, it was determined that the main criminals were the landlord Xia Chengxiang and his brother, and the rest, such as Xia Dian'san, were their lackeys. They immediately arranged for them to arrest the lackeys, and the district chief led the militia to "American Territory" to capture Xia Zhaoxiang and Xia Chengxiang.

	When they reached the river, the militia crossed the river and brought the boat over. They crossed the river together, it was already late at night. When the main criminals woke up from their dreams, their necks were already twisted in the hands of the militia. They were immediately brought to the district along with the other murderers, where the poor peasant representatives testified and the murderers confessed their crimes.

	On the 12th, a public memorial was held for the martyred village chief and the criminals were tried. Representatives from various districts and villages and the masses from surrounding villages came to participate. After the memorial, the criminals confessed to the conspiracy to murder the village chief. The more the audience heard, the more they hated, and finally the criminals were sentenced to death by the masses. (Jinan Branch)

　　不深入发动群众的教训！九屯地主害死村长
    恩县新四区九屯是个工作很没有基础的小村子，全村共五十多户人家，在全区的最北边上，区里工作同志很少到这村来，所以虽然去年经过一段群运和复查，但该村群众却始终在地主夏兆祥、夏成祥兄弟二人的统治下，没有得到翻身。村长王福先是个贫农出身抗战八年的荣誉军人，在村工作很积极，但由于我们领导上撑腰不够，所以群众总是起不来，可是村长已经成了地主的眼中钉，同时村长也看透了这步棋。当贫民集训的时候，村长曾给区长说：“区长你可要在心，我稍不留神说不定那个时候就会死到俺村地主夏兆祥家兄弟手里，那时候你可要给我报仇！前些日子为了麻痹我还请我到他那里喝酒”。
    就在贫民集训的时候，地主夏兆祥、夏成祥，在家乘机活动，摆布好了杀害村长的阴谋毒计，他暗暗的把他几个狗腿召集在一块开小会，其中有惯匪夏佃三、指导员徐连才、新队长小成、旧队长王宝镇和夏兆祥的小子（过去出身都是土匪流氓），夏兆祥端着酒壶对他几个说：“今天咱们集合到一块商量商量是不是还想活着，要愿活着就赶快想办法，现在村长到区里去受训，回来还不是要咱们的命吗？咱总得想个办法。”他们一面喝酒一面计划，最后按地主的意见先拿枪把全村群众威胁住，等村长回家就捆起他来，说群众和他算帐，在大会上喊个口号打死他，对区里就说是群众意见。
    集训贫民是八月二十九日结束的，到了本月九日清早九屯的贫民代表到区里报告说，“群众”把村长打死了；但他的面色显得难过的样子。这时区长就断定了是地主弄的事，但问代表时，他却只是掉泪不敢说。这个代表是村长的侄子。地主知道贫民代表到区里说话有作用，他也打量着他到区里不敢暴露，所以他威胁了代表之后，就叫他到区里来报告。当时区长叫代表先回村集合群众，随后到九屯去了，一进村只见街上堆了很多人，这时地主坏蛋们远远的看见了区长，就拿着枪威胁群众说：“那个不喊口号小心着你们的脑袋”。他们就领着头的喊：“欢迎区长给我们作主！”这时区长拿定了主意要麻痹他们一下，同时看看实情。当区长看见村长的死尸血淋淋的躺在人群中间时，心里虽然像刀绞一样，却硬着心肠，故意的问村长到底是怎么死的？地主坏蛋们说是“群众”打死的，请区长给作主。区长说既是群众打死的坏人，政府一定给你们作主，埋了他吧！地主坏蛋看着区长没看出他们的马脚来，胆就更大了，随乘机说他这样坏人群众真恨透了，还埋他干么？趁早拉他河里去吧！区长给他解释说：“他活着有罪死了还有罪吗？还是埋了他吧！”夏兆祥又插嘴说：“他还有个小兄弟，大了也不是好物，打总子叫他弟兄俩一块去吧！给群众除害除到根。”区长又解释说：“还是谁作的谁当，不要连累小孩。”最后区长又对群众宣布只要是百分之九十人的意见政府就一定给作主，地主坏蛋们又操纵着喊口号“现在政府真有眼”！“老百姓可到了翻身的时候了”！当区长离开这村后，地主坏蛋认为他们的诡计成功了，心中暗喜，全村群众却回到家去偷偷的掉泪。
    地主坏蛋夏兆祥家兄弟们也早就预料总有一天群众会起来和他清算，所以他早就作了准备。九屯的北面紧靠着运河的河圈，今年直河之后，这河圈便成了四面靠水的天然据点了，他兄弟二人就在这里修了一处宅子，他弄了两只船，一只在南边河里供他来往回家用，他过去之后把船靠到北边上，南面就过不去人了，还按置了个浇菜园子的给他站着岗，另一只船在北边河里，一旦有事他就可以乘那只小船逃到故城地里去，他觉得这个地方很保险，老百姓给他起了个名叫“美国地”。
    在区长走后的那晚上，他兄弟俩就很得意的回到“美国地”里，认为是高枕无忧了。
    区长回区之后就和附近村里的积极分子研究这个问题，最后确定杀人主犯一定是地主夏成祥家兄弟二人，其余夏佃三等是他的狗腿，当即布置了由他们去抱狗腿们，区长就带领着民兵去到“美国地”捕夏兆祥和夏成祥。
    到了河边，民兵过河把船弄过来，齐过了河，已是深夜了。当主犯从梦中惊醒的时候，脖子已经扭在民兵手中了，当即连同其他凶手一齐带到区里，由贫民代表证明，凶手们承认了罪行。
    十二日，设灵公祭死难村长和审判凶犯，各区各村的代表和周围村庄的群众都赶来参加。祭灵后，凶犯向众供述阴谋杀害村长经过，到会群众越听越恨，最后被群众判处死刑。  （冀南分社）
