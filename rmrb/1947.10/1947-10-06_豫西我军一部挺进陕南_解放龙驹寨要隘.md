  　Liberates the Strategic Pass of Longjuzhai
    [Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 4th] Delayed news: A unit of our army on the Western Front advanced into Southern Shaanxi and liberated Longjuzhai, a strategic pass on the Xi'an-Jingziguan highway between Shangxian and Shangnan counties, on September 26th. Over 70 enemy guns were captured, as well as three vehicles and a quantity of military supplies.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 3rd] The People's War Support Teams accompanying the Chen-Xie army on their southern expedition are vying to perform meritorious service and have created many glorious examples. They are all emancipated peasants from the Taiyue area, traveling over a thousand li from Southern Shanxi to Western Henan, each carrying a load of over thirty jin. Before crossing the river, a mule carrying a mountain gun for a certain brigade broke down. Zhang Zun, Xie Xiaozhi and 14 others from the Qingshui 7th District's war support team immediately divided into two shifts to carry it by hand. The cannon weighed a thousand jin, and they carried it across the river all the way to the front lines. They traveled over 200 li roundtrip and no one fell behind. Zhang Congfu from Nanjicun village in the Quwo 1st District, and Han Zhisheng from the 3rd District, and others carried large ladders to climb mountains and cross rivers, and while four people usually carried one end, they always carried one end alone. Although exhausted, they refused to rest. Their care for the wounded was even more meticulous. Zhang Xingtai from Tuanlicun village in the Qingshui 3rd District was a member of the war support team in the Southern Shanxi campaign. Because he didn't perform any meritorious service last time, he volunteered to participate again this time, and he was determined not to go home without performing meritorious service. He greeted the wounded warmly, saying, "You sacrificed and shed blood for us ordinary people, and we can't repay your kindness."

　　豫西我军一部挺进陕南
  　解放龙驹寨要隘
    【新华社豫西前线四日电】迟到消息：西线我军一部挺进陕南，于九月二十六日解放西（安）荆（紫关）公路商县商南间的要隘龙驹寨，俘敌人枪七十余，缴获汽车三辆，军用品一部。
    【新华社豫西前线三日电】随陈谢大军南征的人民参战队，争相立功，创造了许多光辉的范例。他们都是太岳区的翻身农民，从晋南到豫西辗转千余里，每人荷重都在三十斤以上。渡河前某旅驮山炮的骡子坏了一匹，沁水七区的参战民众张遵、谢小志等十六人即分成两班用人力抬运。炮重千斤，他们一直抬过了河，还抬到了阵地上。往返二百余里，没有一个掉队。曲沃一区南极村张从福，三区韩治生等抬大梯子爬山渡河，别的四个人抬一头，他们总是一个人抬一头，虽然累得精疲力竭还是不肯休息。对于伤员的照顾更是无微不至。沁水三区团里村张兴泰是晋南战役的参战队员，因为上次没有立功，这次又自动报名参加，并下定决心不立功不回家。他亲热的招呼伤员，并说：“你们为咱们老百姓牺牲流血，咱们这也报答不了你们的恩。”
