Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 16th: A portion of Chen Xie's army launched an offensive between Luoyang and Zhengzhou, and on the morning of the 11th, captured Yanshi County and several stations along the Longhai Railway, controlling over 100 li of railway between Luoyang and Heishiguan. At midnight on the 12th, we liberated Mengjin County. The results of both battles are still being tallied. These two cities, one 70 li east of Luoyang and the other 60 li northeast of Luoyang, are the 12th and 13th county seats liberated since our southward crossing.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 16th: Chen Xie's army swept the outskirts of Luoyang, entering the West Gate, killing and capturing over 700 enemy soldiers. On the eastern front, a portion of our army launched a fierce attack on Luoyang at the beginning of this month. Between the 7th and 10th, we continuously captured Chiang Kai-shek bandit strongholds such as Qilihe in the western suburbs, Gushui Town, Yanqiu, the Sanshan Village exit of the Luo (yang) Yi (yang) Highway, and Huaishapo, annihilating over 600 defending enemies, forming a large arc-shaped encirclement of Luoyang and bombarding the defending enemies inside and outside the city with artillery fire. On the night of Double Tenth Festival, a valiant unit launched a thunderous attack on Xigong, a large Chiang Kai-shek garrison only three li from the city, and the heavily defended West Gate, engaging in fierce battles, killing many enemies and capturing over 100 alive. Now that Yanshi and Mengjin have been liberated simultaneously, all roads between Luoyang and the outside world have been cut off.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 16th: The so-called "offensive" of Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army Corps on the eastern front has been completely crushed by us. On September 9th, Li Tiejun, commander-in-chief of Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army Corps, personally led three brigades of the 3rd Division and units of the 124th Brigade and 17th Brigade to advance southwest from Luoyang; however, by the end of September, they were still wandering between Luoyang and Songxian, constantly avoiding our main forces. However, we still inflicted several blows on them, killing and capturing over 1,580 enemy soldiers, and routed the 51st Regiment of the 17th Brigade, severely damaging the 1st Regiment of the Youth Army Brigade. Afterwards, the enemy still ventured westward along the Luo (yang) Lu (shi) Highway, and on October 2nd, over 10,000 enemies, carrying over 40 vehicles, dragged themselves into the empty city of Luoning. At this time, they suddenly heard that their 64th Brigade had been annihilated by us at Tiemen. Before dawn, the enemy's 3rd Division turned around and fled to Hancheng Town, 50 li southwest of Yiyang, but immediately fell into our heavy encirclement. The bandits broke through the encirclement more than ten times but were repelled, leaving over 600 corpses and over 50 prisoners. Only because of continuous heavy rain were they spared complete annihilation. On the 9th, when Luoyang was in emergency, the enemy immediately burned the vehicles and supplies they were carrying, struggled to cross the Luo River, and returned to Luoyang to provide reinforcements. Our army pursued them to the outskirts of Luoyang, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits discarded their helmets and armor along the way, extremely embarrassed.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, 16th: This agency's reporter, Mu Xin, commented on the victory of Chen Xie's army on the eastern front, stating: Just as the western front achieved victory and Chen Xie's army knocked on the gates of Tongguan in Shaanxi, Chiang Kai-shek hastily pieced together the Fifth Army Corps and launched an "offensive" on the eastern front on October 1st, vainly attempting to occupy Mianchi and Luoning to support Hu Zongnan. Unexpectedly, the People's Liberation Army on the eastern front descended like a heavenly force, two days ahead of the enemy, annihilating the enemy's right-wing 64th Brigade in the Tiemen area and routing the enemy's left-wing 51st Regiment of the 17th Brigade in the Yiyang area, and inflicting heavy damage on the 1st Regiment of the Youth Army Brigade. The main force of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in western Henan, the 3rd Division (three brigades, over 20,000 strong), was also beaten to a pulp and fled in disarray. The enemy's entire deployment was disrupted from then on, leaving them at a loss, and the so-called "offensive" had turned into an extremely embarrassing rout. Our army fought bravely for ten days, capturing five cities and dozens of villages and towns around Luoyang in succession. On the night of the 10th, we took advantage of the victory to attack the West Gate of Luoyang and the Xigong of the Datun barracks.

If our army's westward push to Tongguan and advance into southern Shaanxi supported the victorious advance of the Northwest People's Liberation Army into the Guanzhong area, then this victory on the eastern front, encircling Luoyang and threatening Zhengzhou, has further thrown the fragmented Central Plains battlefield of Chiang Kai-shek into chaos, once again proving the clumsiness of Chiang Kai-shek's strategic deployment and the incompetence of his command.

It is even more obvious that Chiang Kai-shek's source of troops is exhausted. For example, the security regiment accompanying the 64th Brigade this time was temporarily cobbled together from the security teams of several counties such as Dengfeng, Yichuan, Linru, and Luoyang, so their combat effectiveness was extremely low. As Wang Wencai, the deputy brigade commander of the Chiang army's 64th Brigade who laid down his arms, said: "They are simply vulnerable." According to prisoners of war, when Chiang Kai-shek flew to Xi'an on the 20th of last month, he ordered Hu Zongnan to open the Longhai Railway within half a month. Now that the second "half month" is almost over, the People's Liberation Army not only continues to control the 520 li of railway line between Luoyang and Tongguan, but also controls over 100 li of railway east of Luoyang.

### 豫西解放偃师孟津我军紧缩包围洛阳  蒋匪第五兵团“攻势”完全破产

　　豫西解放偃师孟津我军紧缩包围洛阳
    蒋匪第五兵团“攻势”完全破产
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十六日电】陈谢大军一部于洛阳、郑州间发动攻势，十一日晨一举攻克偃师县城，及陇海路车站多处，控制洛阳至黑石关间铁路百余里。十二日午夜，我又解放孟津县城，两役战果均在清查中。该两城一在洛阳以东七十里，一在洛阳东北六十里，为我南渡后解放之第十二、十三座县城。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十六日电】陈谢大军横扫洛阳外围，攻入西关，先后毙俘敌七百余人。东线我军一部本月初起猛扑洛阳，七日至十日间，连续攻占西郊七里河、谷水镇、延秋、洛（阳）宜（阳）公路出口三山村、怀沙坡等蒋匪据点，尽歼守敌六百余，而形成对洛阳的大弧形包围线，并以排炮轰击城内外守敌。双十节夜，某部劲旅复以雷霆万钧之势，攻入距城仅三里之蒋匪大屯兵场西工，及蒋匪重兵防守之西关，战斗激烈，斩敌甚多，生俘百余。刻因偃师、孟津已同时为我解放，故洛阳与外间之一切道路均被切断。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十六日电】东线蒋匪第五兵团的所谓“攻势”，已被我完全粉碎。九月九日蒋匪第五兵团总指挥李铁军亲率整三师三个旅及一二四旅、十七旅等部由洛阳向西南前进；然至九月底尚徘徊于洛阳、嵩县间，始终逃避我军主力。但我仍先后予以数次打击，毙俘敌一千五百八十余人，且将十七旅五十一团击溃，青年军一旅一团亦受重创。之后敌仍冒险沿洛（阳）庐（氏）公路西进，十月二日敌万余人携汽车四十余辆，拖拖沓沓进入洛宁空城。此时突闻其六十四旅被我歼灭于铁门，不待天明，敌整三师即掉头回窜至宜阳西南五十里之韩城镇，但已立即陷入我军重围。该匪突围十余次均被击退，遗尸六百余，被俘五十余，仅因连日大雨，幸免全歼。至九日洛阳告急，该敌立即焚毁所携汽车及辎重等，争渡洛河，回援洛阳，我军尾追至洛阳城下，蒋匪沿途丢盔弃甲，极为狼狈。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十六日电】本社记者穆欣评论陈谢大军东线胜利称：正当西线告捷，陈谢大军叩陕西门户潼关之际，蒋匪七拼八凑，慌忙组成了第五兵团，十月一日在东线发动“攻势”，妄图进占渑池、洛宁，予胡蛮以策应。不意东线解放军以天降之势，先敌两日，一路将敌右翼六十四旅在铁门地区歼灭，一路则在伊阳地区将敌左翼十七旅五十一团击溃，并予敌青年军一旅一团重创。豫西蒋匪主力整三师（三个旅两万余众）也被打得落花流水，抱头鼠窜。敌整个布置从此被打乱，弄得手足无措，而所谓“攻势”已变成狼狈已极的溃败、我军奋战旬日，连下洛阳周围之五城及数十村镇。十日夜，且曾乘胜攻入洛阳西关及大屯兵场西工。
    如果说我军西逼潼关，挺进陕南，策应了进入大关中西北解放军的胜利进军；那么这次东线的胜利，包围洛阳，威胁郑州，则使蒋匪支离破碎的中原战场阵营更加混乱，又一次证明了蒋匪战略布置的拙劣与指挥的无能。
    至蒋匪兵源枯竭，更为明显。如这次随六十四旅的一个保安团，即由登封、伊川、临汝、洛阳等好几县的保安队临时凑成，故战力极低。正如放下武器的蒋军六十四旅副旅长王文才所说：“根本不堪一击”。据俘虏谈，上月二十日蒋贼飞西安时，曾令胡宗南半月内打通陇海路。现在第二个“半月”已快过去了，解放军不仅始终控制洛阳潼关间铁路线五百二十里，且洛阳以东百余里铁路亦已转为我军所掌握了。
