Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 3rd: The Jicha Mengliao People's Liberation Army, which had advanced to the Beining Railway, the artery of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, with the cooperation of over ten thousand militiamen, launched a large-scale sabotage campaign on the Shanhaiguan-Suizhong section on the 29th of last month. After a fierce battle, our army rapidly expanded its gains, and by dawn on the 30th, captured over ten important stronghold stations. Qiantun Hong, Zhongqiansuo and their stations, which are over ten kilometers from Shanhaiguan, as well as Huangdi, Gaoling, and Songlinggou (three kilometers northeast of Zhongqiansuo), Wanjia Tun (six kilometers south of Suizhong), Liangshui River Bridge and other strongholds and stations were successively captured. Over a hundred miles of railway line from the suburbs of Suizhong to Jin Si Dian, ten kilometers east of Shanhaiguan, has been completely and thoroughly destroyed by us. The remaining enemy at Wanghutun, six kilometers east of the forward street, is also being encircled and annihilated by our army. The militia armed forces along the line are fiercely cooperating in destroying the railway, and the People's Liberation Army is sweeping the sides of the railway and advancing towards Shanhaiguan and Suizhong.
