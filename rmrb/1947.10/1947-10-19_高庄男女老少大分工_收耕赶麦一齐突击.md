　　[Our Dispatch] After ideological mobilization and specific calculations, the autumn harvest, wheat sowing, and autumn plowing work in Gaozhuang Village, Fifth District of Lucheng County, is now proceeding vigorously.
    
    At the beginning, due to the continuous cloudy weather, the masses dared not harvest the autumn crops on a large scale, fearing that the cut crops would rot in the fields. A few women were still busy spinning and weaving. There was a widespread idea that "we have never grown much wheat here in history" against expanding wheat fields. In order to eliminate these negative concerns and ensure that the autumn harvest, wheat sowing, and autumn plowing were not delayed, a meeting of more than two hundred people from the whole village was convened on the night of October 1st for in-depth mobilization. First, the masses were inspired to recall that this year's autumn harvest was the result of multi-faceted struggles, including rushing to sow after drought and overcoming hail disasters. This aroused the masses' enthusiasm for rushing to harvest and created a sense of urgency. In addition, it was explained that natural disasters such as continuous cloudy weather, strong winds, and early frost were still threatening us, which made the masses even more anxious. After discussion, it was proposed to "rush to harvest, rush to sow, and rush to plow," using the "three rushes" to overcome the "three fears" of "first fearing continuous cloudy weather, second fearing wind, and third fearing the ground freezing and preventing plowing." Then, the slogan "Grasp the first handful, then grasp the second handful, and next year's summer harvest will be good, and we won't be afraid of autumn drought" was put forward, establishing the idea of sowing more wheat to make up for the poor harvest. After the ideology was mobilized, it was demanded that everything be carried out with a "concentrated effort." Cui Laiwang suggested that just talking about doing it was not enough, there had to be a goal. Everyone then made specific calculations. The whole village had a total of 4,051 mu of autumn land. In addition to the 812 mu already planted with regular wheat, 650 mu were planted with catch crops of wheat, and another 240 mu will be planted with wheat, requiring a total of 3,960 workdays. There were actually 220 full laborers and 70 animal labors. It was determined to finish sowing the wheat by the 22nd day of the eighth lunar month, finish harvesting the autumn crops by the 3rd day of the ninth lunar month, and finish plowing the land and composting fertilizer by the 15th day of the ninth lunar month. In order to ensure the realization of the plan and the completion of the rushing to harvest, rushing to sow, and rushing to plow faster and better, the whole village implemented organization and a major division of labor for women. Women and children harvested grain, picked bean pods, and moved corn stalks, while men harvested, transported fertilizer, sowed wheat, and plowed the autumn fields. Elderly men and other semi-laborers threshed the grain. A reasonable method for calculating work points was also established. In the tense autumn harvest season, life must be arranged appropriately, so it was decided to implement democratic discussion to arrange life. Competitions were also proposed to each other. Each group had great enthusiasm. In two days, they sowed another 35 mu of wheat and harvested 784 mu of autumn crops, truly forming a "three rushes" movement with men, women, old, and young all working together.

  　收耕赶麦一齐突击
    【本报讯】潞城五区高庄村的秋收种麦秋耕工作，经过思想发动和具体计算，现已轰轰烈烈的干起来。
    一开始，因天气不断阴，群众不敢大量收秋，怕割倒烂在地里，少数妇女也就仍然忙于纺织，对扩大麦田普遍存在着咱这里历史上就不多种麦的思想，为了解除这些消极顾虑，做到秋收种麦秋耕三不误，十月一日黑夜，召集了全村二百余人的大会，进行深刻动员，首先启发群众回忆了今年的秋收是从多方斗争得来的，经过抢垧突击下种，抢旱及雹灾，这样引起了群众抢收情绪思想上紧张起来，加以说明了连阴、大风、早冻等天灾仍在威胁着我们，群众就更着了急。经过讨论后提出了“抢收、抢种、抢耕”，用三抢来战胜“一怕连阴，二怕风，三怕地冻不能耕”的三怕思想。接着提出“抓了头一把，再抓第二把，明年收好夏，秋旱也不怕”的口号，树立了多赶麦，补欠收的思想。思想动起来以后，要求一切进行“突击”，崔来旺提出光说干不行，还得有个目标才行，大家接着就进行了具体计算，全村共四千零五十一亩秋地，除已种正茬麦八百一十二亩，赶茬麦六百五十亩，再赶麦子二百四十亩，共需工三千九百六十个，实有折全劳力二百二十个，畜力七十个，确定阴历八月廿二日赶完麦子，九月初三日收完秋，九月十五日耕完地，沤完肥。为了保证计划的实现和抢收、抢种、抢耕完成的更快更好，全村实行了组织起来，妇女大分工，妇女儿童割谷、摘豆角、搬玉茭，男人收整秋、送肥、种麦、秋耕，老汉等半劳力打场，并订出合理的计工折工办法，在紧张的秋收季节中，生活要安排合适，决定实行民主讨论安排生活。并互相提出竞赛。各组劲头都很大，两天又赶种麦子三十五亩，收秋七百八十四亩，真正形成男女老少齐下手的三抢运动。（太行三专通报）
