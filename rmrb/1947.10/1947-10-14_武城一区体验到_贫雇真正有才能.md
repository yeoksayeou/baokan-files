　　Wucheng First District Experiences:
　　Poor and Hired Peasants Truly Have Talent
　　[Report from Jinnan by our newspaper on the 12th] In the past, the leading ideology of the Wucheng First District was very distant from the poor peasant class, unable to see their suffering and urgent demands, consistently resorting to coercion and commandism, and taking over everything. The hired and poor peasant class, driven by the need to survive, expressed dissatisfaction, such as being unwilling to attend peasant association meetings or speak at meetings. As a result, the leaders considered them "backward," even using sarcastic and abusive language such as "stubborn," "incompetent," and "slave-like" when referring to the hired and poor. This time, in mobilizing the hired and poor, their boundless talent and wisdom educated and transformed our backward thinking. Many poor peasants said during their grievance sessions: "The district and village cadres are in league with each other, we don't have the status to speak. You see, when they arrive, they go straight to the village cadre's house, and the village cadres are constantly going to meetings in the district. When it comes to dividing the fruits [of land reform], with all the three grades and nine ranks, each person gets a share. That's just the full man not knowing the hungry man's plight. We are so unwilling, but we don't dare to say anything. If you want to talk about fairness in that kind of fruit distribution, let them exchange their property with us poor people, but they wouldn't want to exchange with us, would they? In the past struggles, all they knew was to leave three mu of land for each landlord, but why didn't they care about how much land we poor people actually have? Now, in terms of what the landlords eat, drink, and live in, isn't everything much better than ours?!" The hired and poor not only can see the issues, but they also have the most methods in their work. When forming hired and poor peasant groups, they were very clear about the steps, fearing that bad elements would infiltrate. First, they connected with the poorest and most suffering, those without any status, then they connected with the general poor, and finally, they individually educated, transformed, and absorbed poor elements from within. During the connection process, they were afraid that the old village cadres would collude and obstruct them. Everyone mutually proposed: Let's handle our own affairs, don't rely on others. They were also afraid that the district would not support them, so they tested the attitude of the district cadres and said, as long as you stand up for us, we dare to do it. Especially some poor elements from within, we used to think that these people shouldn't be connected with, but after these people were educated by the poor peasant groups, the opinions they expressed are worth studying. They said: "Poor people have to do anything for food and drink. It's impossible to live on an empty stomach anyway. Who doesn't know that doing those things is bad, but what can we do if we don't do them?" When establishing the leading advantage of the hired and poor peasants, we were always concerned about the relationship between the old village cadres and the hired and poor, whether the middle-peasant village cadres would be dissatisfied, etc. Experience has proven that as long as the hired and poor peasants rise up, they are not afraid of anything. They tell the old village cadres about their personal suffering and show them their active work. After the poor peasants work boldly, they immediately realize that only under the leadership of the poor peasant class can things be done well for the poor. When forming poor peasant groups, some old village cadres also went to connect, but as a result, the poor peasants ignored them, and some directly pointed out: Don't interfere with our affairs, let us handle it ourselves. At this time, the leadership tightened the education of the old village cadres, reviewed the past inadequacies in serving the poor peasants, and the cadres were convinced that the poor peasants had already risen up. When the poor peasant groups began to operate, the landlords transported things out, and the poor immediately publicized loudly: You landlords are guilty and timid. These things are all exploited from the poor. Transport them, hide them, transport one share, we will recover two shares. This controlled the activities of the landlords even better than setting up sentry posts and carrying out investigations in the past. After hearing about the re-examination, a landlord in Yangzhuang quickly found a family for his daughter and arranged the marriage. In just five days, on the day of the wedding, he pulled a full cart of chests and cabinets, and the new daughter-in-law wore layers of silk clothes, thinking that he could transport them out at once. Who knew that the poor peasants had already prepared, and the cart didn't even leave the village. Afterwards, everyone said: They really have the means, no one said anything beforehand, no one saw any signs, and they only did real things when the time came. From this period of mobilizing the hired and poor, we deeply feel that it was wrong to say that "the poor peasants are backward" in the past, and sarcasm and abuse even more so meant losing our position. In fact, once the hired and poor peasants are mobilized, their class consciousness will be displayed, and they will have unparalleled creativity and methods.

　　武城一区体验到
  　贫雇真正有才能
    【本报冀南十二日电】过去武城一区领导思想上与贫农阶层距离很远，看不见他们的痛苦和迫切要求，一贯强迫命令，包办代替，而雇贫农阶层为生活所迫，因此也就表现了不满。如不愿参加农会开会，开会也不愿发言等等。这样一来，领导人就认为他们“落后”，甚至把“顽固”、“无能”、“奴才样子”等讽刺漫骂的话加在雇贫头上。这次发动雇贫中，他们无限的才能和智慧教育和改造了我们的落后思想。很多贫农在诉苦中说：“区干和村干一伙，咱够不上说话，你看他们来了，就往村干家里去，村干整天价往区里开会。分果实，什么三等九级，一人一份，这才是饱汉子不知饿汉子饥。咱多么不愿意，也不敢说。那样分果实，要说公平，叫他们和咱穷人换换家业，那就不和咱换了吧。过去斗争光知道给地主每人留三亩地，怎么不管咱们穷人究竟有多少地呢？现在地主吃的喝的住的那一样不比咱强的多？！”雇贫不仅能看出事来，在工作中办法也是最多的。当串连雇贫小组时，他们怕坏人混进来，步骤是非常清楚的。首先串连最穷的、最受痛苦。没有地位的，再串连一般贫苦的，最后个别教育改造吸收贫苦的走里分子。串连中他们怕老村干搭伙阻挠，大家互相提出：咱们的事，咱自己办，不要依靠别人。他们又怕区里不给撑腰，试探区干的态度，并说，只要你们给作主，我们就敢干。尤其是一些贫苦走里的人，我们过去总认为这些人不该串连，可是这些人经贫农小组教育后，发表的言论也值得研究，他们说：“穷人为吃为喝，什么事也得干，饿着肚子反正不能过，谁不知道干那些事不好，不干又有什么办法呢？”在树立雇贫农领导优势时，我们总是顾虑老村干与雇贫的关系，中农村干是否会不满意等等，经验证明：雇贫农只要起来以后，什么都不怕，他们以亲身所受痛苦，说给老村干，并以积极工作，给老村干去看。贫农大胆的工作以后，立即就使他们体验到：只有贫农阶级领导，才能给穷人把事办好。在串连贫农小组时，有的老村干也去串连，结果贫农就不理，有的就正面提出来：你不要管俺的事，还是俺自己办吧。这时领导上抓紧对老村干的教育，检查过去为贫农服务不够，贫农已经起来，干部也心服了。贫农小组开始活动，地主往外运输东西，穷人就大肆宣传：你们这些地主是贼人胆虚，这些东西都是剥削穷人的，运吧，藏吧，运走一份，我们要追回两份。这样控制住地主的活动，比过去布置站岗清查还强哩。杨庄一地主听到复查后，赶快把闺女找了个婆家，连说带娶，不过五天，娶的这天，拉着满车东西柜箱，新媳妇穿的一层一层的绸缎衣裳，满以为这一下子就运出去了，谁知道贫农早已准备好了，车子都没出了村。事后都说：就是有办法，事先谁也不吭，看不出一点消息，到时候光办真事。从这一段雇贫发动中，我们深刻感到过去说“贫农落后”是错误的，讽刺漫骂更是失掉立场的，事实上，雇贫农已经发动，阶级觉悟就会显示出来，并且有无比的创造力和办法。
