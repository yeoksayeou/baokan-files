　　[Reported from Jinnan on the 17th of this month by this newspaper] The Fifth District of Yuanchao organized semi-able-bodied individuals to cultivate the land, using surplus labor for sideline occupations to earn money and purchase livestock. Since the 25th day of the sixth lunar month, the district began mutual aid combining agriculture and sideline occupations, organizing semi-able-bodied individuals to vigorously engage in sideline occupations with surplus labor. In the forty days up to the fifth day of the eighth lunar month, grinding flour earned 7,767,800 yuan, and with the addition of sideline occupations such as weaving, spinning, transportation, and salt extraction, the entire district earned a total of 32,148,170 yuan, plus 176,400 jin of red sorghum. Nineteen new flour mills, eleven firewood factories, nine cotton carding bows, eight cotton ginning machines, six oil presses, and five oil-grinding pots were also added. Spinning has seen even greater development. The district originally had 4,619 spinning wheels, of which 982 have been converted into accelerated spinning wheels. Due to the earning of money from sideline occupations and the promotion of jointly purchasing livestock, the number of domestic animals has greatly increased. For example, the original plan was to add 500 livestock by the end of the ninth lunar month, but 387 have already been added. The original plan was to add 1,500 pigs by the end of the ninth lunar month, but 1,877 have already been added, exceeding the original plan by 377. The original plan was to add 250 sheep, but 270 have already been added, also exceeding the target by 20. The reasons for the above achievements are mainly the following two points: First, the promotion of buying livestock together; if one household does not have enough money to buy, three or four households will buy together. This joint purchase of livestock can also develop mutual aid organizations. The second is to organize semi-able-bodied individuals to participate in production, freeing up able-bodied labor to engage in sideline occupations, earning more money to feed pigs and jointly purchase livestock. Experience has shown that the more semi-able-bodied individuals participate in the village or community, the better the sideline occupations are and the more livestock and pigs are added. For example, in the Shanyue community, more than 50% of the semi-able-bodied individuals are organized. In the entire district, they earn the most money and buy the most livestock, which is a very good example.

　　元朝五区伙买牲口
    【本报冀南十七日电】元朝五区组织半劳力上地，将节余劳力投入副业，赚钱添置牲畜。该区自旧历六月廿五日，就开始农副业结合的互助，组织起半劳力，以节余劳力大搞副业。至八月初五四十天内，计磨粉赚洋七百七十六万七千八百元，再加上编织、纺织、运输、淋盐等副业，全区共赚洋三千二百一十四万八千一百七十元，外赚红粮十七万六千四百斤。又新添十九座粉坊、十一个木柴厂、九个弹花弓、八个轧花车、六座油坊、五口磨油锅。在纺织上，更是大大的发展了。全区旧有纺车四千六百十九个，现已改造成加速轮纺车的有九百八十二个。由于副业赚钱和提倡伙买牲口，家畜大增，如牲口原计划到旧历九月底添五百个，现已添到三百八十七个，猪原计划阴历九月底添一千五百个，现已添到一千八百七十七个，超过原计划三百七十七个，羊原计划添到二百五十个，现已添到二百七十个，也超过任务二十个。造成以上成绩的原因，主要是以下的两点：一是提倡大买牲口，一户钱不够买不起，就三户或四户伙买，这样伙买牲口还能发展互助组织。再就是组织半劳力参加生产，省出整劳力来搞副业，赚了钱多喂猪伙买牲口。经验证明：那个村、那个小区，半劳力参加的多，副业就搞的好，牲口、猪添的就最多。如山岳小区，半劳力组织起来的有百分之五十强，全区来说，以他们赚钱最多，买牲口也最多，这是一个很好的例子。
