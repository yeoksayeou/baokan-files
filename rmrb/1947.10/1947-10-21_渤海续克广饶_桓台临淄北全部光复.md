　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th: After the East China People's Liberation Army recovered the three cities of Qidong, Qingcheng, and Boxing in the Bohai area, they marched south, directly targeting Guangrao. On the evening of the 13th, they launched a fierce offensive against the defending enemy. After eight hours of intense fighting, the city was recaptured, capturing over 700 officers and soldiers (the number of killed and wounded is pending investigation), including a unit of the 336th Regiment of the 112th Brigade of the Kuomintang's reorganized 12th Division and the Kuomintang Guangrao County Brigade. More than 200 rifles, 50 warhorses, and other materials were seized. Currently, the vast area west from Huantai and east to the north of Linzi has been entirely returned to the hands of the people. Guangrao was occupied by the Kuomintang's 64th Division on August 14th, just over two months ago.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Luzhong Frontline, 19th: On the 8th, a unit of the Luzhong People's Liberation Army, near Nan Jun, north of Zichuan, launched a sudden attack on the entire First Regiment and one battalion of the Second Regiment of the 213th Brigade of the 45th Division, and local bandits, totaling seven battalions. Over 600 enemies were annihilated, including more than 300 captured enemy officers and soldiers down to the level of deputy battalion commander. Twenty-one light and heavy machine guns, and more than ten 60mm mortars and grenade launchers were seized.
