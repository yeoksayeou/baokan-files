　　American Reactionaries Fear Electoral Punishment
　　"Aid to Europe" Emergency Meeting Ends Without Result
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Washington dispatch: The White House's "emergency meeting" on aid to Europe, which American newspapers have been clamoring about in recent days, has ended without result because both the Democratic and Republican parties fear being punished by American public opinion in future elections and are shirking their responsibilities. According to Representative Halleck, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives who participated in the joint meeting of government cabinet members and congressional leaders on the 29th, "The meeting with President Truman did not reach an agreement, and the Republican Party did not make any promises." According to a United Press report on the 29th, Truman originally intended to decide on the amount of "temporary aid to Europe" at the meeting and "have the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation, which do not require congressional approval, pay for it" to avoid convening a "special Congress unfavorable to the Democratic Party." However, Truman's plan has been thwarted by the opposition of Republican leaders. Republicans demand that "if Truman confirms that the situation in France and Italy is urgent, he should exercise his presidential powers and order Congress to convene." However, with Democratic heavyweights Connally, Lucas, and others "hoping to avoid convening a special Congress," Truman, in order to shirk responsibility, ignored Marshall's insistence on convening a special Congress and decided to "leave the matter to the decision of the joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives." According to a United Press report on the 30th, "Senior Republican spokesmen expressed dissatisfaction with Truman's placing the responsibility for convening Congress on their shoulders." At the same time, Senator Taft, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee and a notorious reactionary, has recently delivered a series of speeches opposing foreign loans, arguing that "American foreign loans are all gifts, and these loans cannot be repaid." Taft even attacked American foreign policy as "losing peace." A certain American figure, when meeting with an Agence France-Presse reporter on the 26th, predicted that Taft "will not represent the Republican Party but will be the first to attack the Marshall Plan." Taft's actions, coming just after Vyshinsky's thorough exposure at the UN of American warmongers and the failure of Marshall's reactionary "offensive" at the UN, are particularly noteworthy.

　　美反动派怕在大选中受民意惩罚
  　“援欧”紧急会议无结果而散
    【新华社陕北二日电】华盛顿讯：美国报纸日来大肆喧嚣之白宫援欧“紧急会议”，由于民主与共和两党均恐在将来大选中受到美国民意的惩罚，互相推诿其责任，业已无结果而散。据参加二十九日政府阁员与国会领袖联席会议之众院共和党领袖哈列克会后宣布：“与杜鲁门总统之会议，并未获致协议，共和党并未予以任何约许”。据合众社二十九日电，杜鲁门原图在会上决定“临时援欧”之款项，并“由不需国会批准之进出口银行与商品信贷公司支付该款”，以避免召开“对民主党不利之特别国会”。但杜氏此种计划，已因共和党领袖之反对而告破产。共和党人要求“如杜氏确认法意两国情势紧急，即应执行总统权利，下令召开国会。”但杜鲁门在民主党要人康纳利、卢卡斯等均“希望避免召开特别国会”之下，为了推卸责任起见，竟不顾马歇尔坚持召开特别国会之意见，决定将此事“交由参众两院委员会决定之”。据合众社三十日电称：“共和党高级发言人对杜氏将召开国会之责任加诸彼等身上，表示不满”。同时，共和党政策委员会主席著名反动派头子塔虎脱，最近连续发表反对对外贷款之演说，认为“美国对外贷款均为送礼，这些贷款不能获到偿还。”塔氏甚至攻击美国外交政策为“正在丧失和平。”美某要人二十六日接见法新社记者时，更预料塔氏“将不代表共和党而为首攻击马歇尔计划”。塔氏此种行动，恰在维辛斯基于联大彻底揭露美国战争贩子与马歇尔在联大之反动“进攻”已告失败之后，殊堪注意。
