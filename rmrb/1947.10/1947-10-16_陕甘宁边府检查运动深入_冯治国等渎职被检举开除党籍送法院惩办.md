Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: The inspection movement led by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government's Communist Party Committee has been widely launched in various units directly under the Border Region Government, and has achieved initial results. The financial departments, which started the earliest, have already exposed the case of Feng Zhiguo, Deputy Director of the Border Region Bank and Acting Director of the Suide Branch, and Chen Zhaofeng, Chief of the Business Section, who arbitrarily abandoned 10 billion Border Region currency worth of materials; Liu Youren, Chief of the Transportation Section of the Trade General Company, for embezzling 1.6 billion Border Region currency; Mo Jiantao, Deputy Director of the Suide Branch, for embezzlement; and Xin Bo, Deputy Director of the Business Department of the Border Region Bank Headquarters, for using public office for personal gain, violating laws, and dereliction of duty. Currently, Feng, Chen, and Liu have been dismissed from their posts, expelled from the Party, and sent to the court for legal punishment. The latter two cases are under close investigation. The Border Region Finance Department is investigating the extravagant and corrupt lifestyle of five people, including former Director Huo Weide and Jing Shirong, the wife of acting Director Fan Ziven, unclear economic procedures, and financial expenditures. The former requires a thorough investigation of public and private finances, and the recovery of public property. The latter needs to clarify whether the expenses are justified and trace the responsibilities. Both need to clarify their thoughts, positions, and their origins. The Education Department reviewed the instability of the class stance in the education line. In the past, Suide Normal School and Mizhi Middle School only emphasized academic qualifications when recruiting students, resulting in the easy admission of children of landlords and wealthy merchants, accounting for 20 to 30 percent of the total number of students in these two schools. The Construction Department (including Guanghua Farm) found that in the past, there was a narrow viewpoint among technical cadres of being divorced from reality and simply emphasizing technology, resulting in agricultural technology being out of touch with the Border Region's 1.8 million people's demand for increased grain production. The main methods adopted by various units in the inspection are four: (1) First, the person in charge takes the lead, introspects themselves, to promote everyone to start the inspection. (2) Everyone inspects typical examples, and then extends to universal inspection. (3) First, review the guidelines and policies, and then link and inspect specific individuals. (4) Universally conduct personal inspections. The Secretariat of the Border Region Government focuses on solving problems ideologically.

　　陕甘宁边府检查运动深入
  　冯治国等渎职被检举开除党籍送法院惩办
    【新华社西北十三日电】陕甘宁边府中共党委所领导之检查运动，已在边府直属各单位普遍展开，且已获致初步成效。进行最早的财经部门，已检举出边区银行副行长兼绥德分行代行长冯治国及业务科长陈兆峰两人擅自抛弃边币一百亿元物资案，贸易总公司运输科长刘幼仁贪污边币十六亿元案，绥德分行副行长莫钧涛贪污案，边区银行总行业务处副处长辛波假公济私、违法渎职案。现冯、陈、刘均被撤职，开除党籍，并送交法院依法惩办。后两案正在严密究查中。边府财政厅正检查包括前厅长霍维德与代厅长范子文的爱人井世荣等五人生活腐化与铺张浪费、经济手续不清及财经经费开支等问题。前者要切实清查公私经济，追回公财公物，后者要查明开支是否正当，并追清责任。而两者均须弄清思想、立场及其根源。教育厅检讨出教育路线中阶级立场不稳，过去绥德师范、米脂中学招收学生只强调文化程度，以致地主巨商子弟易被录取，占该两校学生总数百分之二十至三十。建设厅（包括光华农场）检查出过去技术干部中存在着脱离实际、单纯强调技术的狭隘观点，以致农业技术与边区一百八十万人民增产粮食的要求脱节。各单位在检查中所采用的方法主要有四种：（一）首先负责人以身作则，自我反省，来推动大家展开检查。（二）大家检查典型，然后推及普遍检查。（三）先检讨方针和政策，再联系及检查具体个人。（四）普遍地进行个人检查。边府秘书处并着重从思想上解决问题。
