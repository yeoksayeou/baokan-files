Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 23rd – The main force of the People's Liberation Army captured Yichuan County, a strategically important military and transportation hub on the border of Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, at noon on the 21st. The defending enemy, Chiang Kai-shek’s Yichuan Command, the 27th Regiment of the New 9th Brigade of the 39th Division of the Sichuan Army, the 182nd Regiment of the 61st Brigade of the 90th Division of the Hu Army, a company of the field artillery battalion of the 78th Brigade of the 1st Division, and the Chiang Kai-shek security police teams from Yichuan, Yanchang, and Gulin counties, totaling more than 4,000 men, were completely annihilated without a single one escaping. This city was one of the important strongholds for Hu Zongnan's bandit troops to invade the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. It was strategically located. After years of management by Yan Xishan and Hu Zongnan, Qilang Mountain in the southwest of the city, Tiger Head Mountain in the north of the city, and Phoenix Wing Mountain in the southeast had all been built into strong fortifications. Bunkers were numerous, and the surrounding mountains were cut into sheer cliffs. The interior of the mountains was dug into a network of underground tunnels. The People's Liberation Army began to attack the outer defenses of the city on the morning of the 19th, and launched a general offensive on the city on the morning of the 21st. In just three hours, Qilang Mountain, Tiger Head Mountain, and Phoenix Wing Mountain were completely occupied, and by noon all the enemies in the city were eliminated, and the city was liberated. According to preliminary statistics, more than 400 enemies were killed or wounded, and the enemy's Yichuan Lieutenant General Commander Xu Yongxiu, Colonel Chief of Staff Wang Chengzhi, Colonel Commander of the 27th Regiment of the New 9th Brigade of the 39th Division Peng Youpeng, and Yichuan County Major General Xu Pei, and more than 3,600 officers and soldiers were captured. Four field guns, two mountain guns, four mortars, eighteen 60mm mortars, more than 110 light and heavy machine guns, more than 1,500 rifles, 100 tons of ammunition, 100,000 catties of grain, and 200,000 catties of salt were seized.

Taoyueh [Shanxi Province], 23rd – Guerrillas and militiamen composed of liberated peasants from various counties in southern Shanxi repelled the Yan bandits who invaded from Anyi. After the Yan bandits led by Zhang Mintong in Anyi were besieged by guerrillas and militiamen composed of liberated peasants from various places, they still attempted to put up a desperate fight. On the morning of the 19th, more than 170 bandits, along with one mortar, attacked our barracks and Qiaotou in two routes. They were bravely counterattacked by our guerrillas, killing five enemies. Another two ran into our minefield and were blown up. The rest fled back to their original positions in panic.
