(This dispatch from our Taiyue office on the 5th) The class standpoints of cadres in Northern Yue Region are gradually becoming clear after undergoing ideological and class background investigations. Wang Zhengang, the Director of the Anze Military Committee, whose father, Wang Shengliang, was a feudal landlord from Shangzhuang Village in Qin County, had brought him to Anze to live last year after the mass struggle. After undergoing ideological investigation this time, he resolutely handed over his father and all his belongings to the masses for disposal. Comrade Wang Chunxiang of the Public Security Bureau resolutely divorced Wang Xiuying, the daughter of a landlord. Zhang Hongji, an assistant in the Third District, whose mother-in-law was a landlord, had two gold rings and fifty silver dollars kept at his home; he also handed them over to the masses this time. Jia Qiyang, an accountant of the Zhaocheng County government, drove his landlord father-in-law out of the house, saying, "My position is clear now, I will not support you, a parasite!" In addition, Party, government, and military at all levels resolutely implemented the instructions of the District Party Committee to block the "air-raid shelters" of the landlord class. For example, the Jizi County Party Committee expelled the local bully Cui Shuanghe, who had infiltrated the Party, from the Party. The Zhaoxing County Command removed Guo Heng, the village chief of Datong Village, who shielded those who were struggled against and opposed land reform, from his post and handed him over to the masses for struggle.

　　岳北各地三查深入干部立场逐渐明确
    【本报太岳五日电】岳北各地经过查思想、查阶级后，阶级立场逐渐明确起来。安泽武委会主任王振刚，其父王胜亮，系沁源上庄村的封建地主，去年在群众斗争后，便由王振刚带到安泽安了家；此次经过查思想后，便坚决的将他父亲及一切物资，一并交还群众处理。公安局王春祥同志，坚决与地主女儿王秀英离婚。三区助理员张洪基之岳母，是个地主，放在他家金戒指两个、现洋五十元，此次也交给群众。赵城县政府会计贾其扬，将其地主岳父赶出门去，说：“我现在明确立场了，不养活你这寄生虫啦！”此外，各级党政军也坚决的执行了区党委的堵塞地主阶级“防空洞”的指示，如基子县委将混进党内之恶霸崔双和开除了党籍；赵兴县指挥部，将包庇斗争，象反对土改的大东村村长郭恒撤职，交群众斗争。
