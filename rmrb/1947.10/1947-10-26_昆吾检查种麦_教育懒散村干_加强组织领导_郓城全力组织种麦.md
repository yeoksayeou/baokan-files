　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in the JiluYu region, dated the 24th] In Kunwu's second and third districts, the village cadres have played two extremely different roles regarding wheat planting, either taking the lead or being passive. This is worth learning from and being vigilant about for village cadres in various regions. In Shijia Village in the third district, there are eight production mutual aid teams, all freely formed by middle and poor peasants. To intensify the rush to plant wheat, the village cadres took the lead, going down to each team to participate in pulling the plows and rollers. Every night, the village cadres met to discuss the next day's work based on the situation of each team, and praised model people and model teams on the radio platform. The masses were in high spirits, working day and night. On the 25th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, the whole village held a conference to summarize the work of this period. Eighty percent of the village's wheat planting had been completed, and the remaining bean stubble land was being plowed and harrowed intensively, and would be completed soon. In most villages in the second district, the enthusiasm for production was generally low, and wasteland was everywhere. In Nan Zhaishang Village alone, there were 39 mu of wasteland. The masses did not accumulate fertilizer or make manure, and no one picked up manure on the road. Based on this situation, the Northwest and Southwest sub-districts held a joint meeting of village cadres and identified the main reason as the village cadres not taking the lead in production, not working. Although the basic masses were allocated several mu of land, in addition to taking care of military dependents, they also had to work for the village cadres. Wang Huaizhi, the village cadre of Zhe Sangshu Village, reflected: "During the autumn harvest, I always urged people to go to the fields, but I slept in the village office waiting for official business." After the review, the village chiefs expressed their attitude for the future, strictly correcting their past exploitative consciousness of not working themselves and hiring people or asking the masses to work for them. They also discussed specific plans to actively organize the masses to produce and expand wheat planting. Now the villages have begun to move.

　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in the JiluYu region, dated the 24th] In Yuncheng, south of the Yellow River, the cadres and masses are mobilized to rush to plant wheat. On the morning of the 3rd, Wu Huawen's 161st Brigade, a rebel entrenched in Yuncheng, fled in panic. The entire territory of Yuncheng was liberated, and hundreds of thousands of people were even more excited. When the Yuncheng County Committee studied the work after the recovery, it believed that the most important thing was to plant wheat and increase production. This is to prepare a solid material foundation for the great counter-offensive and is also the general requirement of the masses at present. A ten-day plan to rush to plant wheat was immediately formulated, and county and district cadres personally helped the masses. In the past year, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied Yuncheng four times, and the masses suffered unprecedented disasters. The number of livestock decreased to one-third to two-thirds compared to last year, many young people were conscripted into the army, and most of the grain was looted. Therefore, there were widespread difficulties in manpower, animal power, and wheat seeds during wheat planting. However, under the slogan of "Planting one more mu of wheat means the victory of the counter-offensive will come one day earlier," the masses in each village consciously came up with many ways to solve the difficulties in wheat planting. When the masses in Fuzhuang in the first district began to discuss the issue of wheat planting, they were very worried. Later, they came up with a method of mutual assistance between middle and poor peasants, using livestock to plow the land and people to grind flour. Detailed surveys and statistics were made, and each person was guaranteed to plant one mu of early wheat. Poor peasants generally felt that wheat seeds were difficult to obtain. Later, middle peasants lent some wheat seeds, and a price was set, and autumn grain was repaid according to the price. Chenpo Village has more than 60 qing of land and plans to plant more than 40 qing. Liangdian Village in the fifth district also guaranteed to plant seven-tenths of the land. An old man said, "Eating is a small matter for us, but eating is a big matter for our counter-offensive army. Planting a few more mu of wheat is the capital to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek." In Wangkezhuang in the eighth district, there were few livestock, so the masses organized themselves to dig the land and organized a land-digging team, setting out production rules: (1) Those aged 16 to 50 will participate in wheat planting; (2) The elderly class will use livestock to plow the land, young people will dig the land, and children will deliver messages; (3) Women will push the mill and cook. Currently, the masses in Yuncheng are extremely enthusiastic about wheat planting. In Shaoji in the fourth district, the great alliance of middle and poor peasants was implemented, and 224 mu of wheat were planted in one and a half days. The entire county is currently in a tense rush to complete the task and strive to complete planting before the frost.

　　昆吾检查种麦
  　教育懒散村干
  　加强组织领导
  　郓城全力组织种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】昆吾二、三两区，由于村干带头或村干消极，对于种麦问题起的两种极端不同的作用，值得我各地村干学习与警惕。三区史家寨，共八个生产互助组，都是中贫农自由结合的，为加紧突击种麦，村干带头，下到各小组里，参加拉耧拉砘子，每晚村干碰头，根据各组情形，研究第二天的工作，并在广播台上表扬模范人和模范组，群众情绪很高，不分昼夜的干。在旧历八月二十五，全村召开大会，总结了这一段的工作，已完成全村种麦百分之八十，下剩豆茬地正在加紧犁耙，不日即可完成。二区大部村庄生产情绪普遍低落，荒地到处可见，仅南寨上一村即荒地三十九亩，群众不积肥造粪，路上粪没人拾。根据这个情况，西北、西南两小区召开村干联席会，检讨出主要原因是村干不带头生产，不劳动，基本群众虽分到几亩地，除照顾军属外，还得给村干做活。柘桑树村村干王怀之反省说：“秋忙时，我老是催人家下地，我在村公所里睡着觉等公事。”检讨后各村长表明今后态度，严厉纠正过去自己不劳动，雇人或叫群众替劳动的剥削意识，又讨论出积极组织群众生产，扩大种麦具体计划，现在各村已开始动起来。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】黄河南岸的郓城，干群总动员突击种麦。三日晨，困守郓城之吴逆化文一六一旅，惊慌逃窜，郓境全获解放，数十万人民倍加兴奋。郓城县委会研究收复后工作时，认为最重要者是种麦增产，这是给大反攻准备雄厚的物资基础，也是目前群众的普遍要求，即订出十日突击种麦计划，县区干部亲自动手帮助群众。一年来，蒋匪四次占领郓城，群众遭受空前的浩劫，牲口比去年减少到三分之一到三分之二，青壮年不少被拉去当了兵，粮食多被抢空，因之在种麦中普遍感到人力、畜力、麦种的困难，但在“多种一亩麦，反攻胜利就会早到来一天”的口号下，各村群众都自觉的想出了很多办法，解决种麦中的困难。一区付庄的群众，开始讨论种麦问题时，都很发愁，后来想出了中贫农互助的办法，犁地用牲口，磨面用人，详细作了调查统计，每人保证种一亩早麦。贫农普遍感到麦种困难，后来中农又借出了一部麦种，订出价，按价还秋粮。陈坡全村有地六十多顷，打算种四十余顷。五区梁店村，也保证种麦十分之七，一位老大爷说：“俺吃倒是小事，咱的反攻大军吃是大事，多种几亩麦子，这就是消灭蒋介石的老本钱。”八区王克庄牲口少，群众于是自己组织起来刨地，并组织刨地大队，订出生产规矩：（一）十六岁以上五十岁以下的，都参加种麦；（二）老年班用牲口犁地，青壮年刨地，小孩子送信；（三）妇女推磨、做饭。现郓城群众种麦情绪极高，四区邵集实行中贫农大联合，一天半就种麦二百二十四亩。现全县正在紧张突击中，并争取霜降前种完。
