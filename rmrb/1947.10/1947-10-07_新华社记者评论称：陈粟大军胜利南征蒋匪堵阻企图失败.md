    Chen and Su's Army's Victorious Southern Expedition Foils Chiang Bandit's Blocking Attempt
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huadong Front, 5th dispatch] Our correspondent Zhuang reported on the great victory of Chen and Su's counter-offensive army advancing into Lu, Anhui, and Jiangsu, stating: Chiang Kai-shek's attempts to block the southward advance of the People's Liberation Army in southwestern Shandong have completely failed. The troops under Generals Chen Yi, Su Yu, Chen Shiqu, Tang Liang, and Chen Feilei have marched mightily into the vast plains of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu border region, cutting off the Chiang bandit army's arteries – the Longhai Railway and the Jinpu Railway – between Kaifeng, Xuzhou, and Suzhou, launching large-scale offensive operations. In just seven days, up to October 2nd, they crossed the Yellow River, the Wo River, the Fei River, the Daisha River, and other rivers, successively liberating thirteen county towns and annihilating more than 5,000 Chiang bandit soldiers. Most of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu liberated areas occupied by the Chiang bandits have been recovered. At the same time, vast populations south of the Wo River and the Sha River have been liberated. This victory of Chen and Su in East China, echoing the liberation of Central China by Liu and Deng and the liberation of western Henan by Chen and Xie, will greatly advance the great cause of liberating the northeastern and northern China provinces. Now, the spearhead of the People's Liberation Army's major offensive has reached the Huai River basin. The Chiang bandit army, huddled on the Pinghan, Jin-Hu, and Longhai lines, is terrified.
    Once the People's Liberation Army crossed the Longhai Railway, they galloped freely as if entering an uninhabited land. In seven days, they successively captured thirteen county towns in eastern Henan and northern Anhui. The battles to capture the counties lasted only a few minutes. Under the People's Liberation Army's victorious offensive, one of Chiang Kai-shek's fatal weaknesses – that is, the exhaustion of reserves, with no second line of troops – was completely exposed. In the thirteen liberated county towns, there were no Chiang Kai-shek regular troops; only puppet bandit security teams were responsible for guarding them. Before the People's Liberation Army arrived, they fled in panic, scattering like birds and beasts. Those who could not escape surrendered. The People's Liberation Army, on the other hand, was strong and well-disciplined, and did not disturb the people wherever they went. The people warmly welcomed them, voluntarily acting as guides, providing tea, fodder, and transporting spoils of war, calling the People's Liberation Army "relatives" and "saviors." Now, the People's Liberation Army is opening granaries to relieve the poor, helping farmers thoroughly carry out land reform, and sharpening their swords and preparing their horses to create even more glorious victories.

    陈粟大军胜利南征蒋匪堵阻企图失败
    【新华社华东前线五日电】本社记者庄报导陈粟反攻大军挺进鲁皖苏之大胜利称：蒋介石企图在鲁西南堵阻解放军南下的一切努力，完全宣告失败。陈毅、粟裕、陈士渠、唐亮、陈飞雷将军所部，已经浩浩荡荡进入了豫皖苏边区的广大平原，在开封徐州市与徐州宿县间斩断了蒋匪军的动脉——陇海路京津浦路，展开大规模攻势作战。仅仅在至十月二日止之七天内，即穿越了黄河、涡河、淝河、大沙河等纵横川山，先后解放县城十三座，歼灭蒋匪五千余人。被蒋匪侵占的豫皖苏解放区已大部光复。同时并解放了涡河、沙河以南等地的广大人民。陈粟华东这一胜利正与刘邓解放中原、陈谢解放豫西的在地相互交辉，将解放东北华北诸省的伟业，大大推进一步。现在解放军的大攻势的矛头，已伸抵淮河流域。蜷进平汉、津沪、陇海三线上的蒋匪军，恐慌万状。
    解放军一过陇海路，即纵横驰骋，如入无人之境。七天中连克豫东、皖北十三县城。而攻县之战，历时仅几分钟。在解放军的胜利攻势下，蒋介石的致命弱点之一，即后面枯竭没有第二部队一点，暴露无遗。在已解放的十三座县城中，无一名蒋介石正规军，仅是些伪匪保安团队担任守备，解放军未至，即闻风而逃，作鸟兽散；不及逃亡者，都俯首就擒。而解放军则兵强马壮，纪律严明，所到之处，鸡犬不惊，人民热烈欢迎，自动为解放军当响应、烧茶水、办饲养、运胜利品，称解放军为“亲人”“救星”。现解放军正开仓济贫，帮助农民彻底进行土地改革；同厉兵秣马准备创造更辉煌的胜利。
