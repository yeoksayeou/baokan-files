　　Qinyuan Yanshang Base Point
　　Unleashing the Productive Power of the Elderly
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 24th] The thirteen administrative villages of the Qinyuan Yanshang Base Point have universally launched a movement to respect the elderly, greatly unleashing the power of the elderly and overcoming labor difficulties. During wheat planting, the elderly were generally in charge of plowing while the young women sowed the seeds with seeders, plowing deeply and sowing evenly. Because the elderly were respected by everyone and encouraged by the news of the counter-offensive victory, their energy became even greater. Although they were old, they were still enthusiastic about taking care of the families of military martyrs and the families of militiamen and laborers on expeditions. When Zhang Yanze, a militiaman from Ma Lane who went on a southern expedition, needed to plant wheat, an elderly man planted it for him first. Li Lannan, an elderly man over seventy years old from Yanshang Village, could not even carry a plow to the field, but he asked someone to carry the plow to the field for him so that he could plow the land for the militiamen on the southern expedition. The wheat fields of the fourteen militiamen from Xiacun who participated in the war were mostly plowed and planted by the elderly. Under the influence of the elderly, all men and women with full or partial labor power worked together. Each village began sowing in the second half of September. Ma Lane Village had 340 mu of old wheat fields and 80 mu of new wheat fields, a total of 420 mu, most of which had been planted.
