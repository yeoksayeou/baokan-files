[Reported by our correspondent in Anyang] Amidst the upsurge of mass participation in the army across the county, many exemplary figures have emerged, such as fathers sending their sons to join the army to avenge them and brothers vying to go to the battlefield. Yuan Yanlin from Lingtou, Fourth District, said, "I was disabled last year after joining the army, but I guarantee to send my brother again this year!" Due to the leading influence of his two brothers, thirteen young adults from Lingtou joined the army, exceeding the quota by five. Zhang Nanfang, the militia captain of Jiu Yan Village, took the lead in signing up for the army. Then, Deputy Village Chief Li Tang and Grain Committee Member Zhang Shanyi persuaded his brother to join the army. In the Fifth District, village cadres played the role of locomotives in joining the army. Gao Jinhai from Dongxiahan led six young men to join the army. Chen Xiaosan, the joint defense captain of Hongyan, led five young men to join the army. Duan Zhiquan from Mengjia Village persuaded his younger brother to take the lead, bringing two young men to join the army. Sheng Bao, the civil education director of Mengjia Village, took the lead in joining the army. There were also four from Xiqugou, and two each from Zhangdeng, Yongding, and Chenjiajing. Wang Youdao from Xibojian was the first to sign up at the conference and sent his child to join the army, recounting the landlord's oppression of him, saying: "I am fifty-nine years old and have fled famine three times in my life. The suffering I have endured cannot be described in three days. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, I fled to Shanxi, carrying one child and walking with two children in the snow. I was thin, hungry, and cold, and too weak to walk, constantly falling in the snow. Because there was nothing to eat, I dropped my own grandson in the snow to freeze to death." At this point, he became very angry, and then he said, "Now I have been liberated, living in new tile-roofed houses, cultivating good land, and having enough to eat and wear. I want to send my child to join the army." He advised his child, saying: "This is our own army. You must do a good job, defend our liberation, and only then can we enjoy the good times for a long time." At the victory celebration meeting in Hengling, militia member Guo Laixi said: "Being a militia member is not as good as being in the army. I want to join the army!" Guo Laixi's elder brother said: "You being in the army is not as good as me. You stay home as a militia member to take care of our family. Let me join the army!" The two brothers competed with each other to go to the front line to fight Old Chiang and perform meritorious service for the people. In Fucheng, cadres played a leading role in joining the army. Chang Jinhai, a cadre of the Second Branch, led four young men to join the army. The First Branch also completed eight, the Fourth Branch completed eight, and the Fifth Branch completed three. Currently, thirty-two young men have signed up to join the army. On October 1st, at the counter-offensive rally in the Ninth District, Comrade Lu Guobao, the branch secretary, called on everyone: The autumn seedlings are about to ripen, arm yourselves to defend the autumn harvest! The enemy demands eleven conscripts to replenish the 40th Army and will come to our border areas to seize grain and conscript soldiers. We must arm ourselves to protect grain and men! Immediately, the village chief of Gangli Village guaranteed to lead seven people to join the army. Then, Li Shi, Gejian, Gaoxiaotun, Matoujian and other villages signed up eleven people on the spot, and each village voluntarily proposed to expand the number of registrants to more than one hundred. Ma Haisheng, a liberated youth from Shuangquan Village, signed up at the conference and said: "When the Eighth Route Army came, I was given houses and land. The reactionaries are making trouble and fighting a civil war. If we don't do it, who will? I am willing to join the counter-offensive army to defend the good times!" Under his influence, nineteen young men signed up to join the army.
