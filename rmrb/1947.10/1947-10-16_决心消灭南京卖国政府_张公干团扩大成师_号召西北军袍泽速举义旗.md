(This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 14th dispatch) The 356th Regiment of the 68th Division, which gloriously revolted in Juancheng on September 14th, has been built into the 36th Division of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army with the assistance of the military and civilians of Hebei-Shandong-Henan. Zhang Gonggan, the regiment commander, was honorably appointed as the commander of the 36th Division. (Note: The 356th Regiment originally belonged to the 36th Division of the 68th Army. At the beginning of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Jiang reduced the three divisions of the 68th Army, the 13th, 29th, and 36th, into two divisions, canceling the 38th Division number. The following year, it was temporarily reorganized into two brigades.) Zhang and all officers and soldiers have issued a circular telegram denouncing the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, calling on the Northwest Army comrades who have been oppressed and deceived by the traitor Jiang to stand on the side of the people, and together with the people of the whole country, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and establish a democratic coalition government. The original text of the circular telegram is as follows:

    To the compatriots across the country: Chiang Kai-shek sold out national sovereignty, relied on the assistance of American imperialism, brazenly betrayed his faith, destroyed the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, launched a civil war, and attacked the people of the whole country, causing the beautiful rivers and mountains to be turned into ruins, fields to be barren, and the people to die in heaps. Chiang's treacherous and disgraceful behavior of losing power and betraying the country, and using foreign forces to brutally kill his own compatriots, aroused the righteous indignation of the people across the country. We were originally old troops of Mr. Feng Yuxiang of the Northwest Army. During the Northern Expedition and the Anti-Japanese War, we stood with the people and had a long and glorious history. We are the army of the country and the armed force of the people. We cannot bear to be accomplices and act as executioners for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to brutally kill our own compatriots. Therefore, we resolutely escaped Chiang Kai-shek's shackles, turned our guns around, and opposed Chiang Kai-shek's sinful behavior of harming the country and the people. Comrades of the Northwest Army! Our decades of sacrifice and bloodshed, is it for the traitorous Chiang family to make a fortune and slaughter our compatriots? The Northwest Army had glorious achievements in the Anti-Japanese War, but after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, we were not allowed to accept the surrender, but were instead subjected to exclusion, usurpation and weakening. Many generals of the Northwest Army, such as Ji Hongchang, Liang Guanying, Zhang Yinxiang, Peng Zhenshan, Ge Yunbiao, Song Zheyuan, Zhao Shoushan, Li Xingzhong, Sun Shengxuan, and Wang Xiushen, were either killed, excluded, or expelled. When the civil war began, we were immediately driven to the front line. After one year and two months, more than two-thirds of the remaining Northwest Army had been lost. For whom did we shed our blood? What is the value? Now we can no longer hesitate, waver, or hesitate! Otherwise, we will be ruined and disgraced, and the future will be unimaginable. Comrades of the Northwest Army! Now the People's Liberation Army has launched a full-scale counter-offensive, shaking Jinghuai and Jianghan. It is clear that Chiang Kai-shek will soon collapse. Don't miss the good opportunity, you should immediately raise the banner of righteousness against the civil war, overthrow the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, liquidate all the crimes of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and eliminate the Nanjing "government" that excludes dissidents!

    We advocate: (1) Support the Political Consultative Conference line and establish a national democratic coalition government. (2) Punish the chief culprit of the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek, and war criminals, and hand them over to the people of the whole country for public trial. (3) Realize democratic politics and "land to the tillers". We, all officers and soldiers, are willing to join hands with friendly troops across the country who advocate peace and democracy, and under the leadership of the people's leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we vow to fight to the end for a new China of freedom, independence, peace and democracy!
      Zhang Gonggan, Commander of the 36th Division of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, and all officers and soldiers.

　　决心消灭南京卖国政府
  　张公干团扩大成师
  　号召西北军袍泽速举义旗
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】九月十四日于鄄城光荣起义的六十八师三五六团已在冀鲁豫军民协助下建成西北民主联军三十六师。该团团长张公干荣任三十六师师长。（按：三五六团原属六十八军三十六师，抗战胜利开始，蒋将六十八军十三、二十九、三十六三个师缩编为两师，取消三十八师番号，第二年又暂编为二个旅。）张氏暨全体官兵顷发表通电，声讨卖国贼蒋介石，号召受蒋贼压迫欺骗的西北军袍泽站到人民立场上来，和全国人民一起消灭蒋介石，成立民主联合政府。通电原文如下：
    全国同胞公鉴：蒋介石出卖国家主权，依靠美帝国主义的援助，悍然背信弃义，破坏政协决议，发动内战，向全国人民进攻，致大好河山全舍为墟，田园荒芜，人民死亡枕籍。蒋贼此种丧权辱国，利用外力惨杀自己同胞的罪恶无耻行为。引起全国人民的正义公愤。我们原是西北军冯焕章（玉祥）先生旧部，在北伐和抗日时期，曾和人民站在一起，有悠久的光荣历史。我们是国家的军队，人民的武力，不能忍受为虎作伥，替卖国贼蒋介石当刽子手，来残杀自己的同胞。因此毅然逃出蒋介石的羁绊，掉转枪口，反对蒋介石祸国殃民的罪恶行为。西北军的袍泽们！我们十数年的牺牲流血，难道是为了蒋家匪帮的卖国发财，杀戮同胞？西北军在抗战中有过光荣的战绩，但日寇投降后，却不准我们去受降，反而遭到排斥、篡夺和削弱。西北军许多将领如吉鸿昌、梁冠英、张印湘、彭振山、葛云彪、宋哲元、赵寿山、李兴中、孙省轩、王修身等将领，不是被杀掉，就是被排斥，被驱逐。内战开始，我们立即被驱到第一线，经过一年零二个月，仅存的西北军已损折了三分之二以上。我们到底为谁抛掷头颅热血？有什么价值？现在再不能犹豫迟疑徘徊不定了！否则身败名裂，前途不堪设想。西北军的袍泽们！现在人民解放军已全面大举反攻，震撼京淮江汉，眼看蒋介石不久就要垮台了。千万莫错过良机，应该立即打起反内战义旗，打倒卖国贼蒋介石，清算卖国贼蒋介石一切罪恶，消灭排除异已的南京“政府”！
    我们主张：（一）拥护政协路线，成立全国民主联合政府。（二）惩办内战祸首蒋介石和战争罪犯，交由全国人民公审。（三）实现民主政治与耕者有其田。我们全体官兵愿和全国主张和平民主的友军携起手来，在人民领袖毛主席和朱总司令领导下，誓为自由独立和平民主的新中国奋斗到底！
      西北民主联军三十六师师长张公干暨全体官兵
