    Bravely Marching Towards New Work Posts
    800 Taiyue Cadres Go South
    District Party Committee and Military Region Leaders Personally See Them Off
    [This newspaper Taiyue, 25th dispatch] Following our army's great counter-offensive, Taiyue cadres are enthusiastically going south. On the 21st of this month, another 800 cadres gathered, ready to depart. Leaders of the Taiyue District Party Committee and directly subordinate organs personally came to see them off. Commander Liu of the Taiyue Military Region delivered a farewell speech, encouraging all the southward-bound cadres: "Our task in going south is great. The masses in the new areas need us to mobilize and organize them. This glorious task is unprecedented. I hope every cadre going south bravely steps onto their new work post." Comrade Wei Heng, representative of the Taiyue District Party Committee, earnestly exhorted all the southward-bound cadres: First, our stance must be firm. We are the backbone leading the masses to overthrow [the landlords] and turn over; ignite fires everywhere, overthrow the landlord class, equally distribute land, and have no connection with the landlord class whatsoever. Constantly connect with the practicalities of work and the realities of thought, examine yourselves, and ruthlessly abandon any wavering or unclear aspects of our stance. Second, we must establish a clear mass viewpoint and promote the incorruptible style of being selfless and having nothing but clean sleeves. Third, follow the mass line and oppose administrative orders. After arriving in the new areas, before the masses are awakened, in our work, we should not act out of our own preferences and take over things on their behalf; we should constantly, at all times and places, raise the masses' awareness based on that awareness. More than 20 southward-bound cadres spoke one after another, expressing their determination to fight for the liberation of the fellow countrymen in the new areas. Comrade Gao Ding, representing the southward-bound cadres from Jiexiu, said: "We set off from Jiexiu and received warm care from the masses, who saw us off along the way. This is because we are shouldering a major task, so we are determined to be down-to-earth and use actual work actions to respond to the hopes of the Taiyue masses for us." After the meeting, everyone agreed to "mobilize the masses in the new areas" and "sow more seeds and grow more seedlings."
