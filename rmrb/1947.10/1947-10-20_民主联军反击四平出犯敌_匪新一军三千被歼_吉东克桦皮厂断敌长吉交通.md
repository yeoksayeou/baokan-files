　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 18th: On the 16th, a unit of the Democratic Allied Forces counterattacked the enemy invading from Siping at Jijiapu (more than ten miles east of Bamiancheng), completely annihilating the 150th Regiment of the 50th Division of the Chiang bandits' New First Army (Note: this regiment had two of its battalions annihilated by us east of Dehui in January of this year; this is the second time it has been annihilated), and routed the main force of the enemy's 50th Division that came to its aid. According to preliminary statistics: more than 1,000 Chiang bandits were killed or wounded, 1,659 officers and soldiers, including the deputy head of the 150th Regiment, were captured, and a total of 55 mountain guns, 121 light and heavy machine guns, more than 150,000 rounds of ammunition, and a portion of other military supplies were seized. The regiment was probing towards Bamiancheng from Siping on the 15th, and before it could gain a firm foothold, it discovered our army was following behind it, so it fled in panic. It was surrounded and completely eliminated by our forces after only escaping for more than ten miles. The main force of the bandit 50th Division, with land and air reinforcements from Siping, attacked fiercely four times, but were all defeated by our forces.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 18th: In recent days, a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Forces on the eastern front has counterattacked the enemy invading from Jilin (i.e., Yongji), and took advantage of the victory to capture the important town of Huapichang and many other strongholds, cutting off railway transportation between Ji(lin) and Chang(chun). On the 17th, our army successively annihilated a regiment of the local bandit army, the 172nd Division (reorganized from the Northeast Security Second Detachment), and a battalion of the Provisional 52nd Division (reorganized from the Northeast Security Fourth District Department and attached to the 60th Army) in Qipanjie, Datun (north of Yongji), Hadawan, Huapichang (west of Yongji), and other places. Preliminary statistics show that more than 600 bandits, including the regimental commander Zhao Baizhao and battalion commander Yang Yiquan, were captured, and more than 200 bandits below the rank of battalion commander were killed or wounded. The remnants fled in disarray, with more than 100 falling into the river and drowning. We captured four cannons and sixteen light and heavy machine guns.
