　　Ren Mingrui's Minefield
    Liang Jianguo
  　　　　　I. Deep Thought at Night
    Ren Mingrui is from Yinzhai Village, Pingyao. He had smallpox when he was five years old, leaving him with a face full of pockmarks. His childhood name was Liusuo, so people called him "Ma Liusuo" (Pockmarked Liusuo). As early as the Anti-Japanese War, he was a sharpshooter in the village militia, and more than a dozen enemies died at his hands in scattered incidents. Last year, his rotation team, in addition to killing or wounding 42 enemies in combat, also captured more than 30 "Strive Corps" members. However, Comrade Ren Mingrui was unwilling to lag behind others. After receiving the notification from Pei Defu's flying explosives team, he became anxious every day, wanting to learn how to use explosives.
    But unfortunately, he was a layman in this regard. He called his partner Guo Zhen back, and the two thought about it for half the night. The next day, they experimented with the general method and the use of detonating fuses. There was nothing difficult about it, but where to bury them? How to assemble them? They hadn't figured out a good way. Because of this, he couldn't bother to eat or sleep. On the third day, lying on the kang, he suddenly had an idea in the middle of the night. He got up, turned up the lamp, and woke up Guo Zhen, saying, "I have an idea!" He explained it like this, and Guo Zhen agreed.
    　　　　II. The Bowing Scarecrow
    The next morning, Guo Zhen first found a set of woodworking tools, a large wooden rafter as thick as a leg, and a small wooden rafter as thick as an arm. After the two had eaten, they carried the tools, wooden rafters, wheat straw, and hay, and carried the landmines to the temple outside the village, where they spent the whole day setting things up.
    On the third morning, Mingrui instructed Comrade Guo Zhen to lead a group of people to play the yangko dance with loud gongs and drums to the south end of Liji Village (which is close to the base area). Before long, men, women, old, and young from the whole village went to watch the yangko dance. Comrade Mingrui led a group of people into a threshing ground at the north end of Liji Village. There were several jujube trees on the east side, and the place was called Zaojiadi (Under the Jujube Trellis). This was a gathering place for the enemy. He began to set up his array: He placed sentries around the perimeter and made a scarecrow. The scarecrow held two hand grenades in its hands, and a locally made mine filled with yellow explosives was installed on its head. He also drew smiling eyebrows and eyes on the scarecrow's face, and put a half-new straw hat on its head to dress it up. He also gave it two flags, one with the words: "Strive Corps are real bastards, stealing grain and causing chaos. If you don't turn back, you'll be sorry later." The other read: "Whether you carry a gun or not, you will be treated favorably when you come over. If you carry a gun, you will be rewarded." After it was done, he first called a few secret militiamen and instructed them:
    "We must use this scarecrow to disintegrate the puppet soldiers. No one can come close to watch. If someone comes over and pulls the flag, you are responsible."
    After the militiamen accepted this task satisfactorily, Mingrui also left two plainclothes men to specifically monitor the enemy.
    The next day, as soon as it dawned, he received intelligence that the "Strive Corps" and two *biancun* with more than a hundred people were coming. He immediately went with his partners to the Kui Xing Tower in a neighboring village, craning their necks to listen for movement. Before long, they indeed arrived. The enemy saw the scarecrow as soon as they entered the village. The company commander went over to look at it and said:
    "Who's playing tricks?"
    Several "Strive Corps" members replied casually: "Ma Liusuo."
    The company commander and a group of people looked at the flag, angrily pushed the scarecrow. The unstable scarecrow bowed forward as if bowing, the cloth in front of his chest fell, and the mine on his head exploded with a bang. The small mine exploded two more times in succession. In an instant, there was a cloud of black smoke. Five enemies were killed, and three were seriously injured. The company commander was blown to pieces.
    After this business was done, Mingrui sent a letter to Pei Defu. The first part described the bowing scarecrow, and the second part said: I am your unseen apprentice. From now on, please give me more ideas and introduce your experiences so that I can learn from you.
    　　　　III. House Raiding and Corpse Moving
    After the enemy suffered this blow, they couldn't let it go. They devised a clever plan to lure Ren Mingrui into the city to kill him. So they used their lackeys to write a letter, asking Ren Mingrui to come to the city for a face-to-face discussion. The letter stated that he could have good land and good houses at will, and bring his old mother to enjoy a lifetime of happiness, saying that if he was a captain outside, he would be a battalion commander here. When Comrade Mingrui saw it, he tore up the letter and said: "Damn it, you've got the wrong person." He wrote another reply, saying: "I am raised by people, and I will serve the people to the end. Like you dogs, your stinking reputation will last for ten thousand years. If you don't turn back, you will eventually be cut to pieces by the people. If you want to see me, you can only be captured."
    After seeing the letter, the enemy said angrily: "The Eighth Route Army people are really tough. Let's go hard against hard!" They prepared to burn and loot Mingrui's house.
    Mingrui had already known this news and made preparations. In addition to burying mines in the village, he arranged thirty-six mines in his house and yard using various methods. He had all the gifts prepared, waiting for the guests to arrive.
    Two days later, the "Strive Corps" and a regiment of the Forty-fourth Division came again. Mingrui had already set up mines on the road. The enemy suffered a blow and dared not take the main road. Comrade Mingrui's mines happened to be buried on the small road. That day, the enemy was walking towards Xiquan and stepped on a mine on the road. Three guys lost their lives, and three were injured. It was originally ten li to Xiquan, but it took them a whole morning. When they arrived at Xiquan Village, they first entered Ren Mingrui's door. Who knew that as soon as they opened the door, there was a "May you find happiness upon arrival," and a "Strive Corps" member was lying there, covered in blood. The second "Strive Corps" member came to look and saw a note on the door: "There are mines here." No one dared to enter anymore. That day, the enemy stepped on three more mines in the street. The enemy could not move an inch in the village. They only ate one meal and carried five corpses and five wounded soldiers back.

　　任明瑞的地雷阵
    梁建功
  　　　　　一、深夜苦思
    任明瑞平遥印寨村人，五岁时生了一次天花，长了一脸麻子，乳名留锁，因此人们都叫他“麻留锁”。远在抗日时期在村民兵里便是个神枪手，敌人零星死在他手下的便有十几个，去年他的轮战队，除在战斗中杀伤敌人四十二名外，还活捉了三十几个“奋斗团”，可是任明瑞同志是不愿落后于人的，当他接到裴得富飞行爆炸组通报以后，天天发急，想学他搞爆炸。
    但可惜在这方面他是个外行，他把他的伙伴郭珍叫回来，两个人想了半夜。第二天实验了一下一般按法和爆发管的用法，倒还没有什么难处，只是往那里埋？如何修装？还没有想出来好办法。为了这他饭也顾不上吃，觉也顾不上睡，第三天躺在炕上想到三更天的时候忽然计上心来，爬起来把灯一拨叫醒了郭珍说：“有办法了！”如此这般一说，郭珍也很赞成。
    　　　　二、草人鞠躬
    第二天早上郭珍先找了一套木工家具，和腿一般粗的一条大木椽，和胳膊粗的一条小木椽。两人吃过饭后扛着工具、木椽，拿着麦桔，草，抬着地雷到了村外庙上，整整摆布了一天。
    第三天早晨，明瑞吩咐郭珍同志带了一股人马扭秧歌锣鼓喧天的到了黎基村的南头（这里是靠近根据地的），不一会全村男女老幼都去看耍秧歌了，明瑞同志就带了一股人串进了黎基村北头一块打麦场里。靠东边有几颗枣树，地名就叫枣架底。这是敌人来往集合的场所。他开始摆起阵来了：他把周围放好警戒做起个草人来，草人两手握了两个手榴弹，头上装了一颗装了黄色炸药的顽造雷，又在草人脸上画出笑嘻嘻的眉眼来，头上给戴了一顶半新不旧的草帽装扮好了，双手上，又给他拿了两个旗子，一个写着“奋斗团真坏蛋，拔丁抢粮胡捣乱，如果不回头，日后要你好看。”另一个写着：“带枪不带枪，过来就优待，如果扛上枪，还能获奖赏。”弄好以后先叫来几个秘密民兵吩咐道：
    “要凭这个草人瓦解伪军，任何人不能来跟前看，如果有人过来拉了旗子，你们负责。”
    民兵们把这个任务圆满的接受了以后，明瑞还又留两个便衣专门监视敌人。
    第二天，天一明接到情报说，“奋斗团”和两个编村一百多人要来，他马上与他的伙伴们到邻近村的魁星楼上伸着脖子听着动静。不一会，果然来了。敌人一进村就看见草人。连长过去瞧着说：
    “这是谁捣的鬼？”
    几个“奋斗团”随口答应道：“麻留锁”。
    连长和一股人看了旗子，气愤愤地把草人一推，不牢稳的草人，鞠躬似的往前倾着，胸前的布片一跌，头上的雷轰的一声响了，小雷连连又响了两声，霎时一片黑烟，敌人被炸死五个，重伤三个，连长叫炸了个稀烂。
    这个生意作过以后，明瑞给裴德富去了一封信，前一段把草人鞠躬说了一遍，后一段说：我是你不见面的徒弟，今后你多给我想办法，介绍经验我好好向你学习。
    　　　　三、抄家搬尸
    敌人吃了这一家伙以后，心上实在过不去，订了个巧计，想把任明瑞哄进城去杀了，于是就通过了他们的狗腿，写出一封信来，要任明瑞进城去面谈。信上说明要地有好地，好院子随便占，带上老母来享一辈子福，说在外面当队长，来了这里当营长。明瑞同志见了把信一撕说：“狗日的，把老子看错了。”另外写了一封回信说：“老子是人养的，要为人民办事到底，象你们这些狗种臭名万年，若不回头，终久也是人民千刀万剐的对象，如果想见老子的面，只有你们当了俘虏。”
    敌人见信后气恨恨地说：“八路军的人，真是硬骨头，咱也来个硬对硬！”就准备把明瑞家里烧光抢光。
    明瑞早知道这个消息，也作了准备，除过村子里埋雷以外，把家里和院里都用各种各样的办法布置了三十六颗雷，真是礼物齐备，单等客人到来。
    过了两天又是“奋斗团”和四十四师一个团来了。明瑞早在路上按好了雷。敌人吃了家伙，不敢走大路，明瑞同志的雷偏偏又埋在小路上。这天敌人往西泉走，又在路上踏响了雷。三个家伙送命，三个负了伤。本来到西泉是十里路，但整整走了一上午，到了西泉村，首先就进任明瑞的门，谁知一开门，就是个“抬头见喜”，血淋淋的，一个“奋斗团”躺下了。第二个“奋斗团”来一看，门上贴了一张字条：“此地有雷。”再也无人敢进去了。这天敌人在街上还踏响三颗雷。敌人在村里寸步难行，只吃了一顿饭，抬了五个尸首，五个伤兵回去了。
