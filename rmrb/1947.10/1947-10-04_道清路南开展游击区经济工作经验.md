Experiences in Developing the Economy of the Guerrilla Zone South of the Daoqing Railway
    Talk by Yin Zhihai, Recorded by Guang Yi

Before July this year, our Fourth Military Sub-district, in conjunction with the guerrilla war, developed economic work in the area south of the Daoqing Railway. The victory in economic work, in turn, strongly supported the guerrilla war.

The area south of the Daoqing Railway is part of the North Henan plain on the north bank of the Yellow River, including all of Wu Zhi and Wen Counties and parts of Bo Ai, Xiu Wu, and Qin Yang, with a population of 400,000, and is very productive. In the autumn of 1945, it was completely liberated by the People's Liberation Army from the hands of the Japanese invaders. After more than a year of emancipation movements, land reform was initially realized. Last October, it was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and the traitorous bullies and landlords, relying on Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, carried out a cruel "reverse settlement" on the peasants, and the vast majority of peasants once again lived a miserable life.

When Chiang Kai-shek's bandits first arrived, our government and armed forces withdrew to the north of the railway. For a long time, a guerrilla base area was not established, only troops went to fight several battles, causing the mass struggle to lose its reliance. In March of this year, the Party, government, army, and people all fought back, but the economic departments did not return, because they believed that the economic departments were a burden (money and materials) and not suitable for guerrilla warfare. The guerrilla base area was quickly established, and the masses' anti-"reverse settlement" also unfolded accordingly. The biggest difficulty encountered at this time was that our economic strength was too weak. After the bandit occupation, our Jireh currency was suppressed, and a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's currency and American goods flooded the market. The handicrafts and commerce operated by the masses were completely destroyed, and the connection with the old liberated areas was cut off. The Jinan notes could not be used. The troops and cadres could not buy anything, and life was very difficult. The masses also demanded: "Hurry up and find a way to make the Jinan notes circulate." At this time, everyone experienced: "It is not enough to stand firm in the military and political aspects alone, we must also stand firm in the economic aspect," and unanimously requested the economic departments to return quickly.

From the beginning of the work, one-yuan leadership was emphasized. The work of each county was uniformly arranged by the county party committee, and economic work was one of the main contents. Organizationally, a package deal was emphasized. Some economic cadres participated in the armed work teams, and some organized economic work teams, combining as a whole. No matter what kind of cadre, the tasks were the same. Wherever they went, they did all kinds of work. At that time, the tasks put forward by the leadership were three: First, to transform the Chiang Kai-shek currency market into a Jireh currency market. Second, to transform the foreign goods market into a native goods market. Third, to transform the economic connection between the masses and the enemy into an economic connection with us. In terms of practice, the attitude was firm and the momentum was great, proposing: First, resolutely prohibit the use of Chiang Kai-shek's currency. The Chiang Kai-shek's currency owned by the masses should be exchanged by the bank or organized to be pushed to the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied areas. Resolutely prohibit the import of foreign goods, and strictly register those that already exist. Second, organize peddlers to go to the old liberated areas and vigorously support them. Third, everyone must work together. At this time, cadres had concerns, "If we do this, what will happen to the market if it becomes depressed?" The leadership promptly supported them, saying: "As long as we defeat the old, we are not afraid of depression. Don't be afraid of the old merchants' clamoring. As long as it is beneficial to us, do whatever is appropriate," greatly enhancing the cadres' determination.

After the deployment, various places quickly took action. First, they organized some peddlers to go to the old liberated areas north of the railway, gave them loans, issued travel permits, and wrote certificates. They quickly exchanged for necessities, and the masses initially felt that "with Jireh notes, there is a way," and began to have economic connections with the old liberated areas. Immediately afterwards, the masses' anti-"reverse settlement" revenge movement unfolded. Some traitorous bullies took large amounts of Chiang Kai-shek's currency and fled to the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied areas. The landlords who were controlled by the masses also secretly stored Chiang Kai-shek's currency. The masses also complained about the suffering caused by Chiang Kai-shek's currency. When classifying classes, the masses realized: "The landlords love Chiang Kai-shek's currency because they want to rely on Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek's currency is the landlords' ticket. We poor people rely on Jireh notes to produce. Jireh currency is the farmers' ticket. To eliminate the landlords, we must also eliminate their tickets." Ideologically clarifying the class boundaries, the conscious elimination of Chiang Kai-shek's currency movement was launched.

In the masses' revenge movement, the cadres consciously understood the current economic difficulties of the masses, and then organized the masses' economic life. The signs of the bank and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce not only appeared in the markets, but economic cadres participated in mass movements in various places, putting up the signs of the bank and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. If the masses had difficulties, they would be solved. By April, our market had some positions. At this time, there were three types of merchants in the market: one was foreign goods merchants (i.e., those who sold Chiang Kai-shek's American goods and Beijing-Guangzhou miscellaneous goods), who welcomed Chiang Kai-shek's currency; the second was local native goods merchants, who wanted any kind of currency; the third was mountain goods merchants running to the old liberated areas, who were mostly peddlers, many of whom were poor peasants. We supported the third type of merchants, giving them a total of over 2.35 million yuan in loans. They were encouraged and benefited, so they communicated with each other, and the number of people running to the north of the railway increased rapidly. At the end of May, there were a total of 222 people in the whole area, and by June, it had developed to 576 people. Practical action proved that they were the main force supporting our market, because they had the following advantages: First, they understood the needs of the masses, selling a wide variety of goods, selling whatever was needed, and were not afraid of selling unsalable goods and accumulating funds; second, they were flexible in their actions, attending every market and every meeting. When there were no markets or meetings, they immediately went to the villages, leaving goods at home, playing the role of shopkeepers in the countryside; third, they were familiar with the terrain, lived scattered, had few things, had small targets, were easy to transfer, and were not easily damaged (only five people were damaged in four months). Therefore, they made a lot of money. Statistics of 62 people showed that they earned 670,000 yuan in twenty days.

After mobilizing the masses, in more than three months, our economic work greatly developed. Of the 24 markets in the whole area, 20 became local currency markets, basically driving Chiang Kai-shek's currency to the few cities occupied by the enemy. The import of American goods was also stopped, and the trade of mountain goods and local native goods rapidly developed, and the market embarked on real prosperity. Economic work took root among the masses, economic cadres became people loved by the masses. Although the enemy tried its best to destroy our market, under the cover of the masses, even in the most marginal market, the position was always maintained. For example, a bank cadre took 740,000 yuan of Jireh currency to Huang Zhuang, Wen County, in April this year to issue loans. He was surrounded by the enemy, and the masses hid him in the cellar, and the silver dollars were hidden in the pits, and no loss was suffered.

But we also had failed lessons, that is, in some places, the attitude towards defeating the enemy's things was not firm, and the practice was not to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, but to be small-handed and small-footed, and rely on ourselves. For example, Wen County initially feared that the market would be depressed after the strict prohibition of Chiang Kai-shek's currency, so it did not dare to universally and resolutely abolish it, but only selected a market for experimentation. It did not use the main force to organize small-scale adjustment of materials, but only relied on public-owned and public-operated stores. As a result, it failed to open up the situation for a considerable period of time, and Chiang Kai-shek's currency could not be eliminated. The method of experimenting with one market also failed, and a large amount of Jireh currency was concentrated in one place, which instead increased its own difficulties.

The above illustrates two lines and two practices, resulting in two results. The former followed the mass line, and the latter was divorced from the actual needs of the masses. This is our basic experience in our work. (Taihang Branch)

　　道清路南开展游击区经济工作经验
    尹志海谈  广义记
    今年七月前，我们四分区在道清路南结合游击战争，开展了经济工作；经济工作的胜利，又有力地支持了游击战争。
    道清路南，是黄河北岸豫北平原的一部，包括武陟、温县全部及博爱、修武、沁阳一部，人口四十万，出产很丰。四五年秋为人民解放军从日寇手中完全解放，农民经过一年多的翻身运动，初步实现了土地改革。去年十月，又被蒋匪侵占，奸霸地主，依仗蒋匪，对农民施行了残酷的“倒算”，广大农民又重度着悲惨的生活。
    蒋匪初到时，我政权、武装都撤到路北，好久没建立起游击根据地，只是部队去打过几次仗；使群众斗争失掉了依靠。今年三月，党政军民一齐打回去了，但经济部门未回去，原因是认为经济部门是累赘（钱与物），不适于打游击。游击根据地很快建立起来了，群众反“倒算”也随着展开。这时遇到的最大困难，就是我们经济上力量太弱。匪占后，我冀钞被镇压下去，大批蒋币、美货充斥市场，群众经营的手工业与商业，全被摧垮，与老解放区连系也割断了，冀南票不能行使。部队与干部，什么东西也买不到，生活上大感困难。群众也要求：“赶快想办法叫冀南票通行。”这时大家体验到：“光在军事上、政治上站住脚还不行，经济上也得站住脚”，一致要求经济部门赶快回去。
    工作一开始，就强调一元化领导，各县工作都是由县委统一布置，经济工作就是主要内容之一。组织上强调一揽子，有的是经济干部参加武工队，有的是组织经济工作队，整体结合，不管什么干部，任务都一样，凡到一地，什么工作也做。当时领导上提出的任务有三：一、变蒋币市场为冀钞市场。二、变外货市场为土货市场。三、变群众与敌经济连系为与我经济连系。做法上态度坚决，气魄很大，提出：一、坚决禁用蒋币，群众所有的蒋币，由银行兑换或组织向蒋占区推。坚决禁止外货入口，已有者严格登记。二、组织小贩到老解放区去，大力支持他们。三、要干一齐干。这时，干部思想上产生了顾虑，“这样干，市场萧条了怎样办”？领导上及时的给撑腰说：“只要打垮旧的，萧条也不怕，不要怕旧商人的叫嚣，只要对我有利，怎样合适怎样干”，大大地增强了干部的决心。
    布置以后，各地很快便行动起来，首先组织了一些小贩，到路北老解放区去，给他们贷了款、开了路条、写了证明。他们很快便换回了必需品，群众初步感到“有冀南票就有办法”，与老解放区开始有了经济连系。紧接着，群众反“倒算”复仇运动展开了，有些奸霸带着大批蒋币逃到蒋占区去，被群众控制起来的地主，也暗中收存蒋币。群众诉苦也诉出许多跟土蒋币吃亏的事情。到划阶级时，群众便觉悟到：“地主爱蒋币，因为他要靠蒋介石，蒋币就是地主票；咱穷人靠冀南票才能生产，冀钞就是农民票。消灭地主，也要消灭他的票。”从思想上划清了阶级界限，自觉的消灭蒋币运动便搞起来了。
    在群众复仇运动中，干部有意识的了解了群众当前的经济困难，随着就组织群众的经济生活。银行、工商局的牌子不仅在各市场上出现，经济干部在各地参加群运，把银行、工商局的招牌打出，群众有困难就解决。到四月，我们的市场有些阵地了。此时，市场上有三种商人：一是外货商（即贩蒋美货及京广杂货的），他们欢迎蒋币；二是本地土货商，他们是什么票也要；三是跑老解放区的山货商人，他们多是小贩，不少是贫苦农民。我们是扶植了第三种商人，共给他们贷款二百三十五万余元，他们得到鼓舞，又得到利益，便互相串通，分别拉扯，跑路北者，迅速增多，五月底全区共有二百二十二人，到六月就发展到五百七十六人。实际行动中的证明，他们是支持我市场的主要力量，因为他们有以下几个优越条件：一、了解群众需要，贩买货物种类繁多，需要啥贩啥，不怕贩上冷货，积压资金；二、行动灵活，逢集上集，遇会赶会，没有集会时，即刻乡村，家里留有货物，在农村起着坐商作用；三、地形熟悉，居住分散，东西少，目标小，好转移，不易受损失（四个月才有五人受损失）。因此，他们很赚钱，六十二个人统计，二十天内即赚洋六十七万余元。
    经过发动群众，在三个多月内，我们的经济工作就大大地开展了，全区二十四个市场，二十个成为本币市场，基本上将蒋币驱逐到敌占的少数城市里，美货入口也杜绝了，山货与当地土货交易，迅速发达，市场走上了真正繁荣。经济工作在群众中生了根，经济干部成了群众爱戴的人，敌虽竭力摧毁我市场，但在群众掩护下，就是在最边沿的市场，也始终坚持着阵地。如银行一干部今年四月带着七十四万冀钞，到温县黄庄发放贷款，被敌包围，群众即将他藏到地窖里，大洋藏到坑洞中，毫未受损失。
    但我们也有过失败的教训，就是有些地方对于打垮敌人的东西态度不坚决，做法上不是发动群众、依靠群众，而是小手小脚，依靠自己。如温县开始害怕严禁蒋币后市场萧条，因之不敢普遍坚决的取消，只选择了一个市场作实验，没有用主要力量去组织小型调剂物资，只依靠公家公营商店，结果，相当时期内打不开局面，蒋币未能消灭。一个市场实验的办法也失败了，大量冀钞集中一地，相反增加了自己的困难。
    以上说明了两种路线，两种做法，得出了两种结果，前者是走了群众路线的，后者是脱离群众实际需要的，这是我们工作中的基本经验。（太行分社）
