Relying on the Masses to Hold the Ground
	How the Military and Civilians of Junan Persisted in the Seesaw Struggle

　　When Chiang Kai-shek's bandit New Fifth Army, 57th Division (which has been annihilated) and others hastily scurried to the Henan region of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, due to the enemy's insufficient forces and the constant attacks and encirclements by our East China People's Liberation Army, the enemy panicked and scurried back and forth north and south. In Junan County, from August 11th to September 5th, a total of 25 days, the enemy crossed the border back and forth three times, sometimes searching and advancing in a 30-40 li wide area, implementing village-by-village sweeps. Therefore, the military and civilians of Junan were in a very difficult situation during the 25 days of the seesaw struggle. However, due to the cadres relying on the masses and consistently holding their ground without retreating a single step, they set an example of persisting in the struggle behind enemy lines.

　　Initially, cadres in Junan were very panicked under such difficult circumstances, lacking confidence and determination to hold the area. Therefore, the leadership first focused on stabilizing the panicked emotions and clarifying the following three issues in the cadres' minds: (1) Clearly recognizing that the basic situation is favorable to us, and that the seesaw situation is a temporary difficulty in the Henan region. (2) Should we engage in active struggle or passively hide? (3) Should we separate from the masses or persist alongside them, sharing life and death? After these three issues were raised, the cadres' right-leaning sentiments were cleared away. Cadres in some areas resolutely expressed to the masses that they would share weal and woe and would never withdraw from the area, which also boosted the morale of the masses. Secondly, as the enemy searched and advanced, we had to avoid the brunt of their attack in order to preserve our strength. Junan County had three methods for avoiding the brunt: (1) Finding gaps far from the transportation routes, large depressions with a lot of mud and water that hindered enemy movement to hide, and only coming out to operate after the enemy's attacks subsided. (2) Disguising as civilians and hiding in a dispersed manner. (3) Part of the force dispersed and persisted, while another part temporarily maneuvered and transferred before re-inserting themselves.

　　After the enemy's attacks subsided, local bandits and puppet forces rose up to suppress and剿, the enemy set up strongholds along transportation lines, grabbing men, seizing grain, and searching for family members of cadres everywhere. Landlords also took the opportunity to restore their power. Therefore, we immediately launched an anti-剿 struggle, relying on rural strongholds, controlling landlords, capturing and killing enemy spies, and leading militias and village cadres to carry out guerrilla warfare. Comrade Li Hualu of the Nanlu District led a platoon of militia to hide from the enemy's attacks. After the attacks subsided, they operated day and night around Qinlou, supporting the masses and suppressing landlords. Once, they were surrounded and swept by several enemy flanks, but he resolutely swore to the masses that they would live and die together and never leave them, thus stabilizing the morale of the masses. The landlords, seeing that our guerrillas were still operating there, did not dare to raise their heads. Under our reliance on the masses to hold the ground, the masses also relied on us, loving us like flesh and blood. For example, Comrade Da Lao Meng and other comrades working in the Changlin District hid in the large depressions to avoid the attacks, and the masses brought them food and intelligence eight to ten times a day. Under the cover of the masses, the enemy's several attempts to suppress them failed. One day, the enemy sent a wealthy middle peasant to find them, but that person, after meeting Da Lao Meng, said: "The Central Army sent me to find you, you should leave quickly!" As a result, the enemy still didn't find them, and they returned to the village to operate at night. In a certain village, two bad guys who informed on them were captured and killed, causing the landlords and bad guys to be terrified and dare not stir up trouble. After the enemy's attacks subsided, it was necessary to seize the time to actively carry out armed struggle. The leadership also implemented a campaign to establish merits and commend models, and those with significant achievements were commended at any time, or the leaders personally went to express their condolences, which greatly encouraged the persistence of the struggle. On August 11th, the Zhou Bin guerrilla group of six people from the Zhangfeng District followed the enemy, capturing their stragglers. When they arrived at Shenzhuang, an old man reported that there were two Kuomintang soldiers who had fallen behind. The six of them divided into two groups and pursued them to the south of Chenji, where they captured one alive, obtaining a rifle. The other one fled. When they returned to Chenji, they captured two unarmed Kuomintang soldiers. On the same day, the county party committee immediately issued a commendation order, awarding Comrade Zhou Bin a major merit. After the news spread, the cadres were very excited, and cadres from various counties actively led the militia to capture enemy stragglers, cut enemy telephone lines, and launch heavy attacks under the enemy's undefended state, causing them to panic. The "Mao Hutong" militia gave a small group of the Chiang's Fifth Army an unexpected head-on blow. The enemy, as if facing a major enemy, fled in a panic, and the militia captured two enemies, seizing 150 rounds of ammunition and dozens of catties of chickens and pork. Once, two cavalrymen from Chiang's 84th Division went to Fanlou to get chickens, and our district's security team followed them. When they entered the village, they only saw the horses but not the people, because the bandits had gone to get chickens. The security team members rode the horses away. In total, in the 25 days, the militia guerrillas captured 31 Chiang's soldiers alive, killed and wounded 5, and seized 2 guns, 1 telephone, more than 100 catties of wire, and 2 war horses.

　　依靠群众坚持阵地
  　巨南军民怎样坚持了拉锯斗争
    蒋匪新五军五十七师（已被歼）等匆忙窜至冀鲁豫河南地区时，由于敌兵力不足，我华东人民解放军又处处予敌袭击围歼，使敌惊慌失措南北来回奔窜。巨南县自八月十一日至九月五日共二十五天内，敌南北来回过境三次，有时在三、四十里横宽地带搜索前进，实行村村扫荡。因此巨南军民在二十五天的拉锯斗争中，处于十分恶劣形势。但由于干部依靠群众，始终坚持阵地，未退却一步，树立了坚持敌后斗争范例。
    巨南处于如此恶劣环境下，起初干部十分惊慌，坚持地区无信心与决心，因此领导上首先提出稳定惊慌情绪，在干部思想上着重弄明确以下三个问题：（一）明确认识基本形势对我有利，拉锯形势是河南地区的暂时困难。（二）是积极斗争呢，还是消极隐避呢？（三）是脱离群众呢，还是与群众共生死坚持呢？这三个问题提出后，清除了干部右倾情绪，有的地区干部坚决向群众表示同甘苦共患难，决不退出地区，因此群众情绪也很高。其次敌人搜索前进，为保存我们力量，必须避过风头。巨南县避风头有三个办法：（一）寻找空隙离交通要道较远，泥水多，敌人行动不便的大洼隐避，待敌风头过后才出来活动。（二）化装群众分散隐避。（三）一部分分散坚持，一部分暂时机动转移后再插回。
    敌军风头过后，土顽杂伪随之起来清剿，敌沿交通线按设据点，到处抓丁抢粮搜捕干部家属，地主也乘机复辟，因此我立刻进行反清剿斗争，依靠农村阵地，控制地主，捕杀敌人耳目，率领民兵村干开展游击战。南鲁区李化鲁同志率领民兵一个班隐避敌风头过后，昼夜活动于秦楼一带，给群众撑腰，镇压地主，一次被敌人几面包围扫荡，但他坚决向群众宣誓说：要死就死在一块，没有离开群众，因此稳定了群众情绪。地主见我游击队还活动在这里，也不敢抬头。在我依靠群众坚持阵地之下，群众也依靠我们，爱我们如骨肉，如常林区工作同志大老孟等隐避风头躲在大洼里，群众每天十次八次送饭送情报，在群众掩护下，敌人几次去清剿均未成，一天敌派个富裕中农去找，但那人去见大老孟后，就说：“中央军派我来找你，你快走吧！”结果敌人又没找到他们，到夜晚，他们又到村活动。在某村曾把二个告密的坏蛋捕杀，因之地主坏蛋惶恐不已，不敢骚动。在敌风头过后，要抓住时间积极开展武装斗争，领导上并贯澈立功表模运动，对有显著成绩者，随时通报表扬，或领导者亲自去慰问，这对于坚持斗争起了很大的鼓励作用。八月十一日张逢区周斌游击小组六个人，尾追敌后，捕捉其散兵，行至沈庄，一老头报告前面有两个掉队蒋兵。他们六人分成二路，追击至陈集南地时，即活捉一名，得大盖枪一支，另一名逃窜。回来走到陈集，又捉住徒手蒋兵两名，当天县委会立即发出嘉奖令，予周斌同志记大功一次。消息传开后，干部十分振奋，各县干部纷纷率领民兵积极活动捕捉敌散兵，割敌电话线，在敌不设防下，重重袭击，使其惊慌失措。“毛胡同”民兵曾予蒋五军一小股部队猛不防以迎头打击，敌如临大敌，狼狈逃窜，民兵即俘敌二名，缴子弹一百五十发，小鸡猪肉数十斤。一次蒋八十四师骑兵二名到樊楼打鸡，我区保田队跟踪追去，进庄只见马不见人，因匪军打鸡去了，保田队员即骑上马飞风而归。总计在二十五天中，民兵游击队共活捉蒋军三十一名，毙伤五名，缴枪二支，电话机一架，电线百余斤，战马二匹。（冀鲁豫分社）
