　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 19th: The counties east of Shijiazhuang are launching a "Life-Saving Movement" to persuade Chiang's puppet troops to jump out of the civil war pit, and it has been very effective for several months. According to incomplete statistics from Luan City, Gao(cheng) Zheng(ding) Huo(lu) (newly established county), and one district of Zhao County from May to August, more than 1,450 Chiang's puppet soldiers were rescued. Luan City and other places have also established "Chiang Army Home Transfer Stations," and since August, they have escorted more than 90 Chiang's puppet officers and soldiers home. The Second Squadron of the Zhao County Puppet Return-to-Hometown Team originally had more than 70 people, but the serial number was cancelled due to the escape of nearly 50 people. According to Liu Shaoxiang and Gong Yunxia, soldiers who escaped from the Second Company, Third Battalion, 20th Regiment, 7th Brigade (formerly 7th Division) of the Chiang Army's 6th Division (formerly 3rd Army): "More than 1,200 young people who were arrested in Xincheng County this spring escaped at a rate of 70 per day on the way to Shijiazhuang, and most of them have now escaped."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 19th: The people of Zhao County, Gaocheng, Luan City, Zhengding and other counties in eastern Shijiazhuang are launching a "Life-Saving Movement," putting forward slogans such as "Rescue sons, friends, and fellow villagers from the tiger's mouth." At the beginning of this movement, extensive publicity was carried out, and a large number of propaganda materials were printed and transported into Shijiazhuang, calling on Chiang's puppet troops to escape as soon as possible. Zhao County, Gaocheng, Luan City and other places also held mass rallies, and Zhengding City changed the temple fair on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month to a "Withdrawal from the Civil War Mobilization Conference." Most villages in the three counties of Luan City and others successively established "Life-Saving Groups," combined with the merit-making movement, put forward "Striving for one Chiang's puppet soldier counts as a merit," "Saving lives is equivalent to going to the battlefield," and for old ladies, "Striving for one Chiang's puppet soldier is saving a life and accumulating virtue." At the same time, family members of Chiang's puppet soldiers were called upon to call back their children. Some family members of Chiang's puppet soldiers were afraid that their children would be punished by the masses and the democratic government after returning home, and some did not know where their children were stationed. The "Life-Saving Group" explained to them in response to their concerns, citing examples of puppet soldiers who had escaped home and settled down; the masses also combined with the troops to investigate the station numbers of the puppet soldiers’ children, told them how to escape, and gave them travel expenses.

　　In addition, various effective methods were adopted, such as letting the escaped soldiers complain in public at the meetings of Chiang's puppet soldiers' family members. Chiang's lightly wounded soldiers who had escaped from Shijiazhuang recounted the abuse of the wounded by Chiang's bandits at the puppet soldiers' family meetings. After hearing the tragic fact that Chiang's army buried two living wounded soldiers alive, many of the puppet soldiers' family members at the meeting wept. This inspired the family members of Chiang's puppet soldiers to pour out their grievances, trace the roots of their suffering, and settle accounts, stimulating them to save their lives consciously. Thirty households of Chiang's puppet soldiers' family members in Dashiqiao, Zhao County, gathered twenty-seven poor family members of Chiang's puppet soldiers to collectively discuss why their children joined Chiang's puppet army and what hardships their families had suffered after joining Chiang's puppet army… On the spot, fourteen puppet soldiers' family members voluntarily asked to call back their children.

　　Thus, it gradually turned into a mass movement, not only puppet soldiers' family members rescuing puppet soldiers, cadres and the masses persuading puppet soldiers' family members, but also forming puppet soldiers' family members persuading puppet soldiers' family members, and puppet soldiers persuading puppet soldiers. After our county's large team in northern Gaocheng Zhengding Huolu wiped out more than 30 members of the puppet "Return-to-Hometown Team," the women in a certain village quickly conveyed the news to the puppet soldiers' family members, saying, "Hurry up and see our ××!" Then they persuaded, "Don't let our ×× do that again! There is no benefit at all, but it makes the old people worry." Since joining the Life-Saving Group, two old women in × village, Sixth District, Zhao County, put down their bowls after eating and went to find puppet soldiers' family members to persuade them, and as a result, four of the five puppet soldiers in the village were persuaded to return. The director of the Armed Forces Committee of a certain village in Luan City won back 19 people by himself, and a puppet soldier's family member in a certain village entered Shijiazhuang seven times to call back seven puppet soldiers. Chang Xiushan, the sergeant squad leader of the 7th Company of the 1st Battalion of the 94th Regiment of the 32nd Division, Jia Xiuyi, the sergeant squad leader of the Special Service Company of the 7th Division Headquarters, and Fan Yukuang, the military supplies sergeant of the 21st Regiment, and many others, jointly wrote letters advising their companions to withdraw from the civil war pit. Li Jincheng, a first-class soldier of the 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion, was persuaded to return by his friend Li Jinding through a letter.

　　Since the land reform review, the puppet soldiers' family members have more actively participated in the "Life-Saving Movement." The poor peasant puppet soldiers' family members in the Chenxiang District of Zhao County also shared the fruits of the struggle. Zhao Zanghai's family in Mengzhuang, Luan City, obtained five mu of good land and ten jin of wheat in the struggle. Zhao Zanghai was moved and escaped home with Chen Jun from his village. Many puppet soldiers' family members said after sharing the fruits, "In the past, we were really hitting our own eyes with our own fists, and one family didn't recognize another family." In order to better resolve the concerns of Chiang's puppet soldiers who have nowhere to go after escaping, Luan City and other places have established "Transfer Stations for Chiang's Puppet Army Officers and Soldiers to Withdraw from the Civil War."

　　争取蒋伪军跳出内战火坑
  　石东展开“救命运动”
    形成群众性对敌政治攻势
    【新华社晋察冀十九日电】石门东各县展开“救命运动”，争取蒋伪跳出内战火坑，数月来成效很大。据栾城、藁（城）正（定）获（鹿）（新设县），及赵县一个区五至八月四个月不完全统计，共救出蒋伪军一千四百五十余人。栾城各地并又设立了“蒋军回家转送站”，自八月份以来护送回家的蒋伪军官兵达九十余人。赵县伪还乡队二中队原有七十多人，因逃跑近五十人而取消了番号。据蒋军第六师（原三军）七旅（原七师）二十团三营二连逃出之士兵刘少祥、龚云霞谈：“今春新城县被抓的青壮年一千二百多人，在运往石门途中，每日逃跑达七十余人，现已逃跑大半。”
    【新华社晋察冀十九日电】石东赵县、藁城、栾城、正定等县人民展开“救命运动”，提出“救子弟、朋友、乡亲出虎口”等口号。开展这一运动之始，先进行了广泛的宣传，印刷了大批宣传品运进石门，号召蒋伪军早日逃命。赵县、藁城、栾城各地，并普遍召开了群众大会，正定市并把旧历五月初五之庙会改为“退出内战动员大会”，栾城等三县大部乡村并先后建立了“救命小组”，结合立功运动提出了“争取一个蒋伪军就算立了一功”，“救命等于上战场”，对老太太则提出“争取一个蒋伪军，就是救了一条命，积了一份德。”同时又号召蒋伪家属去叫回自己的子弟。有的蒋伪家属怕子弟回来后被群众与民主政府处罚，有的不知道自己的子弟驻在那里。“救命小组”即针对疑虑向其解释，列举逃回家来的伪军已经安家立业的实例；群众并结合部队调查清楚伪属子弟的驻地番号，更告诉他们的逃跑方法，并发给盘费。
    此外，并采取各种有效办法，如让逃回来的士兵在蒋伪属会上当众诉苦。石门逃亡回来的蒋军轻伤伤兵，在伪属会上历述蒋匪对伤兵的虐待，听了蒋军将两个活着的伤兵活埋的悲惨事实后，参加会的伪属们多泣不成声。这样就启发蒋伪属吐苦水，追苦根，算苦帐，激发他们自觉救命。赵县大石桥蒋伪家属有三十户，便召集了二十七户贫苦蒋伪属集体讨论自己的子弟为什么去当蒋伪军，参加蒋伪军后家庭生活上遭受了那些苦处……。当场就有十四户伪属自动要求去叫回自己的子弟。
    于是逐渐转向群众性的运动，不仅伪属救伪军，干部群众劝伪属，而且形成了伪属劝伪属，伪军劝伪军。在藁正获北荒我县大队消灭了伪“还乡队”三十余人后，某村妇女们很快便把这消息传送给伪属说：“赶快去看看咱××吧！”进而劝解说：“再别叫咱××去干那个啦！一点好处也没有，反叫老人们担心。”赵县六区×村两个老婆婆自从参加了救命组，吃过饭把碗一搁便去找伪属劝解，因而该村五个伪军经她劝回了四个。栾城某村武委会主任一人争取回来十九人，某村一伪属先后进石门叫回伪军七个。逃亡回来的三十二师九十四团一营七连中士班长常秀山，七师师部特务连上士班长贾修义及二十一团军需上士范玉枉等多人，连名写信劝告他们的同伴退出内战火坑。二营五连一等兵李金成便是他的朋友李金鼎写信争取回来的。
    自土改复查后，伪属们更积极参加“救命运动”。赵县城厢区贫农伪属一样分到斗争果实，栾城孟庄赵脏孩家在斗争中分得五亩好地，十斤小麦。赵脏孩受了感动，便和他庄的陈俊一同逃跑回家。许多伪军家属在分到果实后说：“过去可真是自己的拳头打自己的眼，一家人不认识一家人。”为更好解决蒋伪军逃出后无处依归的顾虑，栾城等地已设立了“蒋伪军官兵退出内战转送站”。
