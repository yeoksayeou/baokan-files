    [Report from this newspaper, Taihang, 1st] On September 22nd, the local armed forces of the Second Sub-district of Taihang completely annihilated the Yan Xishan diehards' "Shanxi Righteous People Returning Home to Struggle Fourth Regiment," which was out plundering grain, at Banshan, southeast of Qixian County. At 9:00 AM on September 22nd, over 400 men of the Yan Xishan diehards' Struggle Fourth Regiment, stationed in Tuanbai, southeast of Qixian County, led by Battalion Commander Ni Guohua and Deputy Battalion Commander Yang Ziqing, went to Banshan area to plunder grain. After our sub-district's regiment discovered this, it quickly divided into two routes and surrounded the enemy. The local militia also bravely joined the battle. After five hours of fighting, the entire enemy force was annihilated. Over 200 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and 216 men, including Battalion Commander Ni Guohua and Deputy Battalion Commander Yang Ziqing, were captured alive. The following were seized: 14 light machine guns, 2 small cannons, 73 rifles, 5 pistols, over 2,000 rounds of ammunition, 15 head of livestock, over 10 sheep, and some grain. Note: Most of the members of this Struggle Regiment were fleeing traitorous landlords from Qin (County), Wu (Xiang), and Qi (County). The masses hated them to the bone. After this capture, they were all handed over to the local masses for processing. The masses were very happy.
    [Report from this newspaper] On September 18th, the Shouyang Battalion launched a surprise attack on the Yan puppet Revenge Team of over 40 people in Bailintou, north of Yuci Road. A part of the enemy was annihilated, and the remaining enemies fled to Shitie Town. Bailin was then immediately captured by us. Soon, over 30 men of the enemy Struggle Regiment from Shitie Town came to reinforce them, but were defeated by our pre-ambushed troops. In this battle, 20 enemies were killed, 29 were captured, and the following were seized: 1 light machine gun, 2 small cannons, 6 rifles, over 100 rounds of ammunition, 5 cannon shells, 15 head of livestock, and 70 sheep.
    Also, on September 22nd, the Road West Work Team of the Second Sub-district secretly hid in the Dami Temple in Baicun (10 li north of Taigu City). At 9:00 AM the next morning, a total of 24 men from the puppet rural self-defense force of Shuixiu, armed with one light machine gun and one small cannon each, attacked our Baicun. After the enemy entered the village, we surrounded the enemy on three sides and contracted towards the inside of the village. After the battle started, the enemy was compressed into a civilian house. The battle ended in a dozen minutes. 3 enemies were killed, 16 were captured alive, and the following were seized: 1 light machine gun, 1 small cannon, 8 rifles, 1 submachine gun, and 500 rounds of ammunition. We suffered no casualties. (Frontline)
    [Report from this newspaper, Taigu] In the battle where the local armed forces of the Second Sub-district of Taihang annihilated over 400 Yan bandits on September 22nd, the militia of Sange Baicheng, Jianfang, and Yan also won a great victory in cooperation with the battle. Of the eleven of them who participated, they killed eleven enemies, captured five enemies, and obtained 2 machine guns, 2 small cannons, 11 rifles, 8 bayonets, 92 rounds of ammunition, 79 bombs, 2 raincoats, and 2 pairs of shoes. Our side suffered no casualties.
    The most outstanding were Ji Erwa from Baicheng, who killed seven enemies by himself and obtained one machine gun, one small cannon, two rifles, and two bayonets. He hit three enemies with three shots. Yu Erhu obtained one machine gun and one rifle and captured three enemies. The main reason why they were able to achieve such remarkable results was that they had improved their class armed consciousness after the previous rectification of checking the wind and pursuing meritorious service, and they had gained combat experience through frequent struggles against the enemy.

    [Report from this newspaper] At 4:30 PM on September 17th, a total of 400 puppet bandits led by Wang Zemin and Tie Motou in Yongnian City, divided into three routes (Lüdi in the north, West Dam in the middle, and Maosui Tomb in the south), attempted to capture our West Dam in order to plunder grain. After the enemy was discovered by our "Yellow River" guard troops, Lüdi fired the first shot. Under the powerful firepower of our army, the enemy launched several unsuccessful attacks and retreated in a panic. Our army then launched a powerful pursuit. The enemies scattered in the water were like sheep fleeing a pen, and they couldn't care about returning fire, and each fled for their lives. Our army's bullets splashed in the enemy crowd, overturning the enemy's small boats. The battle ended at 6:30 AM. It is estimated that more than 80 enemies, including Battalion Commander Wang Guanwu, Kang Sibao, and Zhang Wanzhen, were killed or wounded, and 6 enemies, including Battalion Commander Sang Fengming and Company Commander Zhou Yingjie, were captured alive. The following were seized: 14 rifles, 1 pistol, and 1,700 rounds of ammunition.
    Another report: Since our army's West Dam battle, the morale of the puppet bandits in the city has been greatly shaken, and the number of people surrendering to our army has increased. From September 18th to 21st, 30 people surrendered to our army in four days, including a squad of seven people carrying full armament. As of today, the planes delivering supplies have not come for 13 days. The grain in the city is about to be exhausted. The only small pigs in each company have been eaten. The puppet bandits are eating the leftover dregs of wine as their staple food. If the planes continue to not come, the puppet bandits trapped in the isolated city of Yongnian will soon be starved to death. (Huang Niu)
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd] The turned-over peasant armed forces of Xishi Village in Xinghe, southern Jin, control the Yellow River ferry and captured Xu Jingxiang, the head of the Chiang bandit "Love the Hometown Regiment," and seven others alive. On the evening of September 11th, the village militia learned from a merchant Liu XX who traded with the Chiang Kai-shek area that Chiang's bandits would sneak across the river the next day. The next day, they combined with XX members of the militia, under the leadership of comrades Li Xinnian and Song Qiying from the work team, and set up an ambush on the river bank. At 1:00 PM, a boat was indeed discovered approaching from the west, with Xu Jingxiang, the head of the Chiang bandit "Love the Hometown Regiment," and his intelligence officer Xu Jingshan on board. After they disembarked, the militia ordered the merchant Liu XX to go forward and talk to the boatman to paralyze the enemy. Militia member Guo Shuichen and others suddenly shot at the boat, threatening the boatman to flee. The remaining militia surrounded and captured the enemies on the beach, completely capturing Xu Xinfang, Xu Qiwen, and two targets of struggle. At this time, the Chiang bandits on the opposite bank discovered this and bombarded them intensively with machine guns and cannons, but it was ineffective. By the 17th, the village militia had captured three enemy intelligence officers and treacherous merchants on the river beach, allowing the masses of Daxing, Luochi, Xin'an, and Taicun villages along the river to safely carry out land reform.
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 1st] The turned-over militia of Jiang County encircled and suppressed the armed Chiang bandit special agents. The Chiang bandit special agents who had previously infiltrated Jiang County to encircle and suppress us had recently been sent back to X County, attempting to kill our peasant association cadres, sabotage land reform, and disintegrate the militia. On the evening of the 20th, a remnant bandit gang of 14 people, led by bandit leader Xu Yonglu, hid in the home of a Wang family on the eastern slope of Anyu Village, and four of them took a pistol and a foreign knife to Anyu Village to find the chairman of the village peasant association. After the Feng Village militia learned of this, they assembled over 40 militiamen and went to encircle and suppress them in two routes at dawn the next day. When the bandits saw the fierce momentum of our militia, they fled in panic. Our militia tracked and pursued them. Between Anqiu, Dongfeng, and Sunwang, the Sunwang militia also came to help suppress them, and then the Dongfeng militia also arrived, surrounding the remnant bandits and annihilating them. Three remnant bandits were killed, six were captured alive, and the rest fled. We seized one machine gun, eight rifles, one pistol, one command knife, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition. We suffered no casualties.
