　　Coordinating with the Great Counter-Offensive to Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek
  　Jinnan Region Goes All Out to Support the Front
  　Military Academy Artillery Unit Graduates 300 Cadets
    [Report from our Jinnan office, 1st] Three hundred students from the No. 1 and No. 8 Artillery Teams of the Jinnan Military and Political School held a graduation ceremony. Everyone is eager to participate in the counter-offensive and make great contributions. They took oaths and are about to leave for the front lines soon. In Hengshui on the 15th and 16th, at the commendation meeting for cadres heading south, 120 out of 200 cadres volunteered. As a result, 82 were approved. Those who were left behind said with regret, "Will it be our turn if there is another opportunity?!" Even the service personnel are vying to follow the army south. Militia stretcher teams from Nangong, Guanxian, Zhentang, and Yuanchao are all competing to go to war. For example, Comrade Wang Xue from the Sixth District of Guanxian, despite not having fully recovered from illness, hurriedly took a stretcher to the front. When the Dongxiao District of the Second District of Zhentang announced that 37 militiamen were needed for the expedition, 68 people volunteered. Before the departure of the stretcher team from Dongtianzhuang, Seventh District of Yuanchao, they said to the masses, "We are going to the front line to rescue the wounded." The masses said, "We guarantee that your families will not have any difficulties. Go ahead with peace of mind." The masses in Huazhuang said, "We will prioritize supporting the families of martyrs and stretchers before we harvest and plant wheat for ourselves." Thirty-four employees from the store, dyeing workshop, sauce garden, and pharmacy of the Benqi Cooperative in the Seventh District of Yuanchao donated more than 2.1 million yuan in savings to the front line. Longping Chengguan Elementary School donated more than 240,000 yuan, and elementary schools in various villages sent a large number of diaries, toothbrushes, etc., as consolation packages to the front line. Women in Shenxian and Pingyin actively prepared military shoes. The women in Lengjia Village, Shenxian, said, "Our army is getting bigger and going further. The shoes must be made strong and sturdy."
