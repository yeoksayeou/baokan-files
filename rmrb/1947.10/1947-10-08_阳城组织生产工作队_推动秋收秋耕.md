　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 6th] To organize a full-scale autumn harvest and planting, the Yangcheng County Production and Combat Readiness Committee has organized a work team of sixteen people, who went to the villages separately on the 28th of last month to help organize the autumn harvest and planting. Their work requirements are: First, to organize all possible male and female labor that can work in the fields, with planned and clear division of labor, to launch a concentrated autumn harvest and planting; Second, to help the masses carry out mutual assistance and coordination of labor and livestock between groups and villages to solve difficulties; Third, to mobilize the masses to seize the time, while harvesting the autumn crops, transporting manure, and plowing for planting, harvesting and planting as they ripen, ensuring that no one is idle and no ox rests, launching a major campaign of autumn harvest and wheat planting. The Taiyue Administrative Office has also organized three work groups to go to the first, second, and fourth districts to inspect autumn production work.
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 6th] A large amount of early wheat has been planted in various parts of Taiyue, and much of it has emerged, especially along the Tongpu and Baijin lines, where the wheat seedlings are already more than an inch high. The 132 mu of early wheat in Wangzhuang Village, Gaoping, is a lush green expanse. At present, various places are rushing to prepare for all the "returning share wheat" work, such as first sending the manure to the edge of the fields, harvesting crops and plowing the land for manure at the same time, harvesting one row at a time, and plowing one row and manuring one row at the same time, so that the land is plowed and planted immediately, in order to organize the labor force.

    【本报太岳六日电】为组织全力秋收秋种，阳城县生产战勤委员会，特组织工作队十六人，于上月二十八日分头下村，帮助组织秋收秋种。他们的工作要求：第一、要组织一切可能上地的男女劳力，有计划的明确分工，突击秋收秋种；第二、要帮助群众进行组与组、村与村的互相帮助调剂劳畜力，解决困难；第三、要动员群众抓紧时间，一边收秋、一边送粪、一边犁种，熟一块收一块、收一块种一块，做到不闲一个人、不歇一头牛，展开秋收、种麦大运动。太岳行署亦组织三个工作组，分往一、二、四三个专区，检查秋季生产工作。
    【本报太岳六日电】太岳各地早麦大量种完，并有不少已出土，尤其同蒲与白晋沿线，麦苗已有一寸多高。高平王庄村一百三十二亩早麦，长的绿油油的一片。现各地正赶作“回伙麦”的一切准备工作，如先把粪送在地边，割庄稼与犁地上粪同时进行，割的时候一垄一垄的割，又割一垄犁一垄、同时把粪上在地里，地一犁全马上就种，以便组织力量。
