　　Jiyuan Third District Overcomes the Ideology of Emphasizing Sideline Production and Neglecting Agriculture
　　Villages Rush to Eliminate Wasteland and Plant Crops Day and Night
    [This newspaper’s Taiyue dispatch dated 27th] The villages in Jiyuan Third District are making every effort to reclaim wasteland and expand wheat fields. After planting more than 12,000 mu of dry wheat, everyone relaxed their efforts, believing that the troops had crossed the Yellow River and they could make money through transportation, which was "immediate gratification," and they often had cash in hand, which was easier than farming. In order to correct this deviation, the leadership first convened a meeting of village cadres on October 18th to discuss that planting more anti-offensive wheat was to prepare a material foundation for the victory of the counter-offensive, and that this year's widespread poor harvest meant that more anti-offensive wheat had to be planted. After the village cadres returned, they used the method of accounting to resolve the ideology of emphasizing sideline production and neglecting agriculture, and continued to expand wheat fields. Originally, the masses in Matou Village believed that planting land was not as good as textile work. The village cadres calculated the textile accounts for them. Last year, one bolt of cloth could be exchanged for five dou of wheat or one shi and two dou of corn. This year, it can only be exchanged for two dou of wheat. If the harvest is still not good next year, even two dou will not be exchanged. Therefore, they corrected the ideology of emphasizing textile work. All the women in the village stopped textile work and rushed to plant wheat, saying, "Planting wheat does not delay textile work. Planting two more mu of wheat is better than spinning for a winter." After Beiguanzhuang calculated the accounts, they proposed, "If you don't want to be in difficulty, you can only plant more wheat." The entire village planted wheat on all autumn land and expanded wheat land by reclaiming wasteland. That night, eighteen mutual aid groups sent out representatives to reclaim wasteland on the mountain with lanterns. Gangtou Village also flooded 400 mu of paddy fields to plant wheat or peas, which would not delay planting rice next year, and planned to reclaim another 200 mu of wasteland to plant wheat. Therefore, women, old men, and children were organized everywhere, using division of labor according to the work, recording work points according to the work, and exchanging at equal value, fully investing in the wave of planting wheat. Villages such as Wangzhai, Miaodian, and Quzhong, old men plowed the land and did hand work, women and children harvested, and young and middle-aged men carried burdens and did heavy work, each giving full play to their strength, increasing labor, and expanding the scope of labor exchange. Women in Quzhong spinning six liang of cotton was equivalent to one work point, and old men plowing the land for half a day was equivalent to one work point. Spinning cotton could be exchanged for plowing land. In organizing animal power, each village plowed and planted while harvesting, and the mutual aid groups used livestock in rotation. Zhongmatou Village organized the livestock to plow dry land first, and then plow wet land. The livestock in the four villages of Gutuitou were used centrally, plowing one village and then plowing another. Villages such as Cheng Village, Quting, and Xizheng even proposed that they should not only rely on livestock, but also on hoes, and organized "steel shovel teams" and "night battle shifts" to rush to plow and plant during the day, and dig with shovels and hoe at night, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient animal power, and paying attention to solving the difficulties of the poor hired peasants. The village cadres of Ma Village lent Li Yilan two dou of wheat seeds, Gangtou Village loaned 100,000 yuan, 70,000 yuan to the poor hired peasants to buy wheat seeds, and the remaining 30,000 yuan to military families and middle peasants. Villages such as Matou took out the wheat from the fruits of struggle to give to the poor hired peasants to plant, and sold part of the fruits of struggle to buy wheat for the poor hired peasants, solving the difficulties one by one.

　　济源三区打破重副轻农思想
  　各村赶夜灭荒抢种
    【本报太岳二十七日电】济源三区各村全力开荒，扩大麦田。在种完旱麦一万二千余亩后，大家对种麦放松，认为部队打过黄河了，可以靠运输赚钱，又是“现过现”，手里常有活钱，还比种庄稼活轻闲。领导上为了纠正这种偏向，首先于十月十八日召开了村干部会议，讨论了多种反攻麦是给反攻胜利准备物质基础，又加今年普遍歉收，必须多种反攻麦。各村干部回去后，便以算帐的方法解决了重副轻农的思想，继续扩大麦田。本来马头村群众认为种地不如纺织，村干部就给他算纺织帐，去年一匹布能换五斗麦，或一石二斗玉茭。今年只能换二斗麦，如果明年收成还不好，就连二斗也换不到，于是纠正了重纺织的思想，全村妇女停止纺织，突击种麦，都说：“种上麦还不误纺织，能多种二亩麦，比纺一冬花还强”。北官庄经过算帐后，便提出“要想不困难，只有多种麦”。全村秋地完全种麦，开荒扩大麦地。当天夜里，十八个互助组就推出代表，打着灯笼上山号荒。岗头村并把四百亩稻田放水种麦，或种豌豆，不误明年种稻，并要再开二百亩荒地种麦。于是到处组织妇女、老汉、儿童，采用按活分工，按活记工，等价交换，全力投入种麦浪潮中。王寨、苗店、曲冢等村，老汉犁地、做手头活，妇女儿童收获，青壮年担挑做重活，各人发扬了各人的力量，增加了劳力，同时扩大变工范围。曲冢妇女纺花六两顶一个工，老汉犁地一晌一工，纺花可与犁地变工。在组织畜力上，各村都是一边收一边犁种，互助组内轮流使用牲口。中马头村把牲口组织起来，先犁旱地，后犁湿地。谷推头四个庄子的牲口集中使用，犁了一个庄子再犁一个庄。程村、曲庭、西郑等村更提出不光靠牲口，还要靠镢头，组织“钢锹队”，“夜战班”，白天突击犁种，晚上用锹挖，用镢刨，克服了畜力不足困难，并注意解决了贫雇的困难。马村村干部借给李一兰麦种二斗，岗头村贷款十万元，给贫雇七万元买麦种，其余三万贷给军属与中农，马头等村把斗争果实麦子拿出给贫雇种，并变卖一部分斗争果实给贫雇买麦子，一一解决了困难。
