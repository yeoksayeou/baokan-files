　　Taihang Administrative Office Military District Issues Order
  　Abolish Veteran Organizations at All Levels
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to further strengthen the close unity between veterans and the broad masses, the Taihang Administrative Office and Military District recently issued a joint order announcing the abolition of veteran management organizations at all levels in the region (county and district management committees, village veteran groups, etc.). The order and proclamation state in brief: Our region's veteran organizations were originally established to facilitate management and education and to solve their livelihood difficulties. In the past few years, veteran organizations in various places have achieved many successes in organizing and leading veteran comrades to engage in production, mutual assistance, and the struggle to turn the tables alongside the masses. Now, as land reform in our region has been initially realized, the class consciousness of the masses throughout the region has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and veterans have all obtained the material conditions (land and housing) for production and prosperity. Therefore, the veteran organizations of the past should be abolished altogether. Veterans in the army were farmers wearing military uniforms, under the leadership of the army. Now that they have honorably retired and returned, they should be under the leadership of the government and peasant associations. From now on, veterans should participate in mass organizations such as peasant associations or militia based on specific circumstances, and completely integrate with the masses in life and production, continue to carry forward the fine traditions of the people's army, and strive to play an exemplary role in the production movement and the movement to turn the tables. It also calls on the masses throughout the region to respect and cherish the honorable status of veterans even more, and help solve their various difficulties, so that every veteran comrade can achieve the goal of "production and prosperity."

　　太行行署军区发布命令
  　取消各级荣退军人组织
    【本报讯】为进一步加强荣退军人与广大群众的亲密团结，太行行署、军区特于日前发布联合命令，宣布取消全区各级荣退军人管理组织（县区管理委员会、村荣退小组等）。命令及布告中略谓：我区荣退军人组织，原为便利管理教育，解决其生活困难而设。几年来各地荣军组织，在组织领导荣退同志和群众一起生产互助翻身斗争中，曾获得了许多成绩。兹值我区土地改革初步实现之际，全区群众阶级觉悟空前提高，荣退军人均已取得了生产发家的物质条件（土地、房屋），故已往荣退军人组织应一律宣布取消。荣退军人在部队中是穿起军衣的农民，是受部队领导，现在光荣退休回来，就应受政府、农会的领导。今后荣退军人按具体情况，参加农会或民兵等群众组织，和群众生活、生产完全打成一片，继续发扬人民军队之优良传统，争取在生产运动、翻身运动中起模范作用。并号召全区群众对荣退军人之荣誉地位，更须尊重爱护，帮助解决他们的各种困难，使荣退同志人人达到“生产发家”的目的。
