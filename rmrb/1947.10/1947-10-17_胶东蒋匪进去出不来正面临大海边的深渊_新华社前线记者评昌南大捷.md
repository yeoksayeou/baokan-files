Xinhua News Agency Eastern Front, East China, 14th. A frontline reporter commented on the great victory in Changyi, stating: Traitor Chiang Kai-shek, in order to carry out the wishes of his American masters, scraped together the forces of his reorganized 8th, 9th, 25th, 54th, 64th, and 45th divisions from early August, blindly trying to force his way into the dead end of the Jiaodong Peninsula. By early October, although he had successively "drilled" into 14 empty cities in western Jiaodong Peninsula such as Jiaoxian, Gaomi, Yantai, and Weihaiwei, he had already lost 13,000 troops due to the obstruction by our internal lines of defense along the way. When he "drilled" into Yantai, an empty city coveted by his American masters for a long time, his blind offensive had reached its peak. He himself began to realize that the situation was not good, so he decided to take the best of the thirty-six strategies and quickly ordered his direct line 9th Division to flee westward, and ordered the Cantonese miscellaneous 64th Division to act as cannon fodder to clear the way. Then he ordered the two brigades, 211th and 212th, of the local reactionary miscellaneous 45th Division to respond from the southwest. Unexpectedly, like a bolt from the blue, it was truly a case of "coming but not being able to leave." The People's Liberation Army was already waiting for a long time south of Changyi. In the six days and nights of fierce battle from the 3rd to the 9th, 12,000 Kuomintang officers and soldiers were annihilated and captured.

The remaining troops of the 9th Division and the remnants of the 64th and 45th Divisions were so frightened that they hurriedly fled into temporary strongholds, wandering on the grasslands east of the Jiao River. Should they leave, they were afraid of being beaten; should they fight, they were still afraid of being defeated. They had no food to eat during the day and dared not sleep at night, relying only on a few planes to send some dry food to fill their stomachs. They were truly in a dilemma, surrounded by enemies on all sides. And Fan Hanjie, the commander of the Kuomintang bandits in Jiaodong, who was hiding under the protection of the American army in Qingdao and commanding remotely, was even more anxious, like an ant on a hot pot. Send troops to rescue them? The 8th, 25th, and 54th Divisions in the east were already overwhelmed by the burden of more than a dozen empty cities; and robbing Peter to pay Paul, the eastern wall would be difficult to protect from being defeated. Not sending reinforcements? He was afraid that the remnants besieged in the west would suffer even more. This made the clumsy commander at a loss and at his wit's end. And Chiang Kai-shek himself was in a critical situation in his old nest, extremely anxious, and watched helplessly as the hundreds of thousands of troops "drilled" into the Jiaodong Peninsula could not be withdrawn, naturally making him not know whether to laugh or cry. The reporter concluded: The goal of our East China People's Liberation Army's eastern front is very clear. They want to cooperate with the nationwide counter-offensive, close the gate of Jiaodong, and eliminate the invading Kuomintang bandit army in the dead end of Jiaodong. The heroic commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army have gloriously realized the first step of this task in the great victory of Changnan. They will continue to overcome all difficulties in the arduous struggle ahead and complete this task even better. As the saying goes: "A blind man riding a blind horse, approaching an abyss in the middle of the night," now this group of blind Kuomintang troops who have "drilled" into the Jiaodong Peninsula are facing an abyss by the sea.

　　胶东蒋匪进去出不来正面临大海边的深渊
    新华社前线记者评昌南大捷
    【新华社华东东线十四日电】前线记者评昌（邑）南大捷称：卖国贼蒋介石为了执行他美国主子的意旨，从八月初，东拼西凑集中其第八、第九、第二十五、第五十四、第六十四、第四十五等六个整编师的兵力，盲目的向胶东半岛这个牛角尖拼命钻进去。至十月初，虽先后钻进了胶东半岛西部胶县、高密、烟台、威海卫等十四座空城，但沿途遭我军内线阻击即已损失兵力达一万三千人之众；而当他“钻”进烟台这个为他美国主子所垂涎已久的空城时，其盲目攻势就已达到了顶点。他自己也开始觉到处境不妙，于是三十六着走为上着，就赶紧命令其嫡系第九师赶快向西逃跑，并命令广东杂牌六十四师充当开路的炮灰，然后令土顽杂牌四十五师的二一一、二一二两个旅由西南两方接应，谁料霹雳一声，真是“来得去不得”，解放军大军已早在昌邑以南等候多时了。从三日到九日六昼夜的大战，一万两千名蒋军官兵遂被歼俘了。
    剩下来的第九师全部和六十四师、四十五师残部，吓得慌忙逃进临时据点，徘徊于胶河东岸的草原上。走吗，怕挨打；打吗，还是怕打垮。白天没饭吃，黑夜不敢睡觉，每天只靠几架飞机送点干粮充饥，真正是陷入了进退维谷，草木皆兵的境地。而躲在青岛美军庇护下遥遥指挥的蒋匪胶东兵指挥官范汉杰，更象是热锅上的蚂蚁一样，好不急煞。派兵援救吧，东边的八师、二十五师和五十四师早已被十多个空城的大包袱压得喘不过气来；并且拆东墙补西墙，东墙就难保不被打垮；不派援兵吧，又怕西边被围这一堆残兵败将还要大吃苦头，这就弄得这位笨拙的指挥官束手无策，一筹莫展了。而蒋贼自己则老窠危急，已万分焦虑，又眼巴巴的看着“钻”进胶东牛角尖里的这十多万人马抽不回去，自然更是哭笑不得了。记者最后称：我华东解放军东线大军的目标是十分明确的，他们要配合全国大反攻，要关紧胶东的大门，把进犯的蒋匪军消灭在胶东的牛角尖里。解放军的英勇指战员已在昌南大捷中光辉地实现了这个任务的第一步，他们还将在今后艰苦的奋斗中，战胜一切困难，把这个任务完成得更好。谚云：“盲人骑瞎马，夜半临深渊，”现在钻进胶东半岛的这批瞎了眼的蒋军，正是临到大海边的深渊了。
