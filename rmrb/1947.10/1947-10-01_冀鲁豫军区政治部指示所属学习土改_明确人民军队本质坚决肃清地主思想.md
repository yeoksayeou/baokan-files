[This newspaper Jilu Yu Twenty-ninth dispatch] The Military Region Political Department specifically issued instructions on ideological education for land reform, calling on all units in the military region to resolutely eliminate feudal landlord ideology, clarify their class stance and the nature of the people's army, and vigorously carry out the movement to examine thinking and examine stance. The instructions pointed out that land reform is the demand of the peasants and the historical task of China's current stage of revolution (anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism). We are soldiers of the workers and peasants, and we should complete this historical task. Therefore, land reform education is an arduous and important task for our party and army building. Comrades from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds in the troops, since they have joined the revolution, should and must abandon their original class stance, resolutely stand with the workers and peasants, and fight to the end for the liberation of the workers and peasants. Another part of the comrades who are not from landlord or rich peasant backgrounds, come from the old society, are influenced by the ideology of feudal landlords, and are detached from production, the feeling of the suffering of peasants gradually weakened, and even a few comrades stand on the position of landlords and rich peasants, make the counter-revolutionary actions of betraying the class. If these ideas are not resolutely eliminated, they will undermine the consistency of our party and army in organization, ideology and action, hinder land reform, and hinder the victory of the war. We must clarify for whom to make revolution, whose life to take, for whom to war, and why war. The instructions pointed out that checking thought is to check the remnants of feudal landlords, further clarify class stance, clarify the nature of the people's army, and ensure the consistency of the troops in thought and action, so as to wholeheartedly work for the peasants to turn over, eliminate landlords, and complete this great historical task. Each comrade should, in the spirit of rectification, bravely and frankly examine their own thinking and composition, recognize their own stance and concepts, and express their attitude and stance towards land reform in the future. Those who refuse to change themselves, adhere to their original class stance, oppose land reform, and those who have ulterior motives to infiltrate the troops, should be resolutely cleaned out.

[This newspaper Jilu Yu Twenty-ninth dispatch] After the direct teams of the military region arranged land reform study, the headquarters, political department, special service battalion, communications team, etc., have begun to study in conjunction with the actual problems in the land reform in the villages. The political department first studied the documents in detail, combined with the fact that two landlords were taken back by the masses in this unit. Some comrades from landlord backgrounds began to think that they should not be struggled against, such as Yu Wenhuai, who began to think that his family had no sins, but after a period of study, he reflected and said: "My father only hired others to work, and often visited 'prostitutes' in the village. Isn't this exploitation and oppression?" Finally, he decided to let the masses handle everything at home. Some comrades also hid their class composition and were cleared out by the accounting method in the study. The study has now turned to personal reflection, and the groups have been appropriately adjusted to the composition and equipped with backbones, and are now stepping up the study.

[This newspaper Taiyue Twenty-fifth dispatch] The direct departments of the Taiyue Military Region investigated class and ideology. Cadres of poor peasant background in the military and political cadre school and the cultural troupe took the lead in launching a grievance-telling movement. Comrade Wang Yingjie of the military and political cadre school, who was originally a liberated junior officer, told how he was forced by the landlord to sell his wife, and how he and his children were beaten by the landlord, which caused the whole audience to burst into tears. When all the sufferers told their grievances, they all cried loudly, three of whom had died of anger because of this, and then were rescued. After the meeting, they still cried non-stop. The cultural troupe adopted the method of poor people uniting with poor people, and as soon as they arrived at the general meeting, they rushed to tell their grievances. This caused a burst of crying. Some people with landlord backgrounds felt very ashamed at this meeting and conducted self-reflection. Other departments followed the wave of telling grievances and carried out in-depth ideological investigation movements.

　　冀鲁豫军区政治部指示所属学习土改
  　明确人民军队本质坚决肃清地主思想
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】军区政治部特颁发土地改革思想教育指示，号召军区各部队坚决肃清封建地主思想，明确阶级立场和人民军队本质，大力开展查思想查立场运动。该指示指出，土改是农民的要求，是中国现阶段革命（反帝反封建）的历史任务，我们是工农子弟兵，应该完成这一历史任务。因此，土改教育是我们建党建军的艰巨的重大任务。部队地主富农出身的同志，他们既然参加革命，就应该也必须放弃原来阶级立场，坚决和工农大众站在一起，为工农大众解放而奋斗到底。另一部分非地主富农出身的同志，来自旧社会，受封建地主的思想的影响，而且脱离生产，对农民痛苦的感觉逐渐淡薄，甚至少数同志站在地主富农立场，做出背叛阶级的反革命行动。这些思想不坚决肃清，就会破坏我党我军组织上思想上行动上的一致，阻碍土改，妨碍战争胜利。我们必须明确为谁革命，革谁的命，为谁战争，为什么战争的思想。该指示指出查思想就是检查封建地主的残余，进一步的明辨阶级立场，明确人民军队的本质，保证部队在思想上行动上一致，以便全心全意为农民翻身，消灭地主，完成此伟大的历史任务。每个同志要以整风精神，勇敢坦白的检查自己思想与成份，认识自己立场与观念，表明今后对土地改革的态度与立场。对那些不肯改变自己、坚持原阶级立场、反对土改的，另有目的混入部队的异己分子，则应坚决予以清洗。
    【本报冀鲁豫廿九日电】军区直属队布置土改学习后，司令部、政治部、特务营、通讯队等，已结合驻村土改中的实际问题开始学习。政治部先钻读文件，结合本单位被群众要回去两斗地主的事实学习。学习中有些地主出身的同志开始认为自己不该斗，如于文怀开始认为自己家里没啥罪恶，但经一段学习之后，他反省说：“我父亲光雇别人做活，在村里常串串门子‘嫖女人’，这不是剥削和压迫人是啥？”最后决心表示家中任群众处理。还有些同志隐藏自己出身成份，在学习中也用算帐方式清查出来。现学习已转入个人反省，小组已适当调剂成份，配备骨干，现正加紧学习中。
    【本报太岳廿五日电】太岳军区直属各部查阶级查思想。军政干校、文工队以贫雇出身同志带头展开诉苦运动。军政干校王英杰同志，原是被解放的下级军官，诉出了他被地主逼得卖了妻子，以及自己和孩子被地主毒打等情形，引起全场落泪。所有苦人诉苦时，莫不放声大哭，其中有三个曾因此气死过去，又救活过来。散会以后，仍是大哭不止。文工队采取了苦人联苦人办法，一到大会上，纷纷争先诉苦。引起一片哭声。一些地主成份的人在这大会上感到非常惭愧，进行自我反省。其他部门随着展开诉苦浪潮，深入查思想运动。
