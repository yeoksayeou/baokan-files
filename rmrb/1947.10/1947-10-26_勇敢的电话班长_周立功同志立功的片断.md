The Brave Telephone Squad Leader
    —— Fragments of Comrade Zhou Ligong's Meritorious Service
    Zhu Jun
    During the Jinan Campaign, General Wang Xinting led a large army to attack Xiangning City. The enemy, relying on ammunition, struggled desperately. Machine guns and cannons poured steel aimlessly in all directions, and heavy machine guns roared madly.
    Squad Leader Zhou Ligong accepted the task of laying a line from Shijie to Fujia Garden. Everyone volunteered to complete this laying task after his mobilization. The young men immediately rolled up their sleeves, tightened their belts, and set off with the wire bundles on their backs. To get to Fujia Garden, they had to pass through the Luo River, but the enemy's eighteen pillboxes formed a line of fire, blocking this area. It was also broad daylight, and the targets were too exposed. If you insisted on passing through there without any task, not to mention the many bullets fired from the enemy's pillboxes, even a rifle, if aimed properly, could shoot you down as a meat target, and laugh at you for being a fool. However, they had a mission to complete! Which revolutionary soldier didn't know battlefield discipline?! However, Zhou Ligong didn't consider this problem, because they were thinking about how to complete this task as quickly as possible.
    When Zhou Ligong was only a hundred meters away from the mouth of the Luo River, he saw the dust on the ground kicked up by bullets. What to do? It was really difficult to pass through this dangerous place. At this time, Zhou Ligong had to let everyone rest and went ahead alone to scout the terrain. He weaved through the roaring barrage of bullets, and finally decided to use some available jujube trees, then advance along the combined concave passage between the two mountain peaks, and finally run straight on the ridge. In this way, the laying task of seven *li* was successfully completed in less than an hour, and no one was injured.
    Suddenly, a heavy rain fell, and a section of wire connecting with the × Brigade was washed into several sections by the raging mountain flood. However, the general offensive was to begin the next day. If the wire could not be repaired, there would be no way to contact and direct them. General Wang Xinting was very anxious, and repeatedly called Chief Guo more than ten times, ordering and urging him to repair it quickly. But the river was so fierce and violent, and huge stones were rolling with the current. Chief Guo frowned, looking at the flowing water, and Zhou Ligong also frowned, looking at the flowing water.
    "Ding-a-ling..." The telephone rang urgently. Zhou Ligong picked up the headset and heard General Wang Xinting asking: "Who is this?"
    "I am the telephone squad leader of the ×× unit," Zhou Ligong replied.
    "I am giving you a task. Quickly repair the telephone line. If you fail to complete the task and contact with the × Brigade is not established, you will be responsible," the phone commanded sternly.
    "Okay!" Immediately, he felt a heavy rock pressing down on his chest, and his whole body suddenly tensed up. He immediately took eight comrades, carrying the wire and tools, and set off.
    A few minutes later, they were standing shakily in the turbulent river water. The yellow water was surging with great force, impacting their thighs and even their bellies. Stones were rolling and bumping under the water. The eight of them held hands, crossing the river, feeling for the wire, connecting the wire, and stringing the line. Finally, they successfully completed this difficult project. When the telephone rang again, he simply reported that the task had been completed. General Wang Xinting, in the echo of the phone, gave them reassurance and thanks for their determination to complete the task. Zhou Ligong's relaxed body and mind were filled with pleasant emotions again, and tiny beads of sweat slowly flowed down his cheeks.

　　勇敢的电话班长
    ——周立功同志立功的片断
    祝军
    晋南战役中，王新亭将军率领大军攻打乡宁城，敌方凭借弹药向我作垂死的挣扎，机枪和大炮，向四面八方无目标地倾泻钢铁，重机枪也不断地疯狂的叫啸。
    周立功班接受了从石碣到富家园的架线任务，大家在他动员自报奋勇地完成这个架设任务，年轻的小伙子们便立即撩衣袖，束紧了皮带，背上线捆出发了，他们到富家园要路过罗河，而敌人十八个碉堡组成的火力，封锁了这块地方，又是大白天，目标是太显露了，如果要是没有什么任务而逞强一定要在那里经过的话，莫说是敌人的碉堡上射出的子弹非常多，其实一支步枪好好瞄一瞄，也是可以把你当肉靶子打倒，而要笑话你是傻瓜的，但是，他们是完成任务啊！革命军人谁不知道战场纪律呢！？不过周立功并没有去考虑这个问题，因为他们正在想着如何才能急于完成这个任务呢。
    当周立功走到离罗河口只有一百米远的时候，只见地上的尘土被子弹打的乱冒，怎样办呢？真是不好通过这个鬼门关，这时周立功只好让大家休息过来，独自到前面去侦察地形，他在咆啸的弹林中钻来钻去，最后决定了通过一些可能利用的枣树，再沿着两个山峰之间的结合凹道跃进，最后在山梁上直跑，就这样七里地的架设任务，不到一个钟头，便顺利地完成了，而且一个人也没有伤亡。
    突然下了一场猛雨，和×旅联络的一段电线，被汹涌的山洪冲成好几段，但第二天就要开始总攻击，如果电线修复不了，便没法取上联络来指挥他们，王新亭将军很着急，连接给郭股长摇了十几次电话，命令和催促很快修复起来，但是河水是那样的凶恶猛烈，而且随着流水巨大的石头在滚着，郭股长望着流水发了愁，周立功望着流水也发了愁。
    “叮呤呤……”电话铃急促地响着，周立功拿起了耳机，只听见王新亭将军在问：“你是谁？”
    “我是××部队的电话班长”周立功回答。
    “给你一个任务，赶快修复电话线，完不成任务和×旅连络不通由你负责”，电话里严肃地命令着。
    “好”顿时他感到心胸里压下一块沉重的磐石，周身突地紧张起来了，便立即带上八个同志背上线拐出发了。
    几分钟后，他们已摇撼地立在湍急的河水里，黄水鼓着巨大的力量向他们的大腿上，甚至肚皮上冲击着，石头在水底下滚着，碰着，他们八个人手拉着手在渡河、摸线、接线、架线，最后终于胜利地完成了这段艰险的工程，当电话铃再次响着铃声的时候，他简单地报告了任务已经完成，王新亭将军又在电话的回声中，给了他们坚决完成任务的安慰和感谢，周立功已经轻松的身心又洋溢着愉快的情感，一些细小的汗滴，从他面颊上慢慢的流下来了。
