To our comrades at the General Branch:

Regarding Xiang Ming's opinion piece on reorganizing finances in Wu'an, published in the People's Daily on the 2nd of this month, there is a contradiction with our piece about Wu'an's achievements published on page two of the same newspaper on the 1st. After our investigation, we found that Xiang Ming had exaggerated some facts. We are sending Wu'an's letter for your review and handling.

In addition, we would like to inform you that our piece was written based on contributions from Liu Genglong, Shao Yonghua, Qiao Peiqi, and Zhu Hanzeng, comrades from the Wu'an Finance Reorganization Working Group.

(Taihang Branch)

Attached is a letter from Comrade Wang Qingyu of the Wu'an County Government's Finance and Grain Section to the Taihang Xinhua Daily:

Xinhua Daily: Your letter has been received. The reports on Wu'an's reorganization of village finances are factual. When everyone saw that the People's Daily disclosed on page two of the 2nd that two-thirds of the funds came from the fruits of struggle, they were very unhappy. Yang Xiangming is a comrade from the Second Section of the Prefectural Office who came to work in Wu'an. He went to Weisushan in the Third District, which is a new district and not a progressive village. It is true that the fruits of struggle were used for community-run projects. In villages with poor performance in the new district, it is possible that simple methods were used, and the fruits of struggle were used as funds, but this is rare. Most of the work involves reorganizing feudal elements and organizing labor to achieve self-sufficiency in production. Before Xiang Ming's report, the leadership had already noticed the phenomenon of abusing the fruits of struggle, and individual villages resolutely returned the funds to the masses.

Respectfully,

Wang Qingyu (Finance and Grain Section Seal)

Editor's Note: It is good that the Taihang Branch immediately conducted an investigation into the issue of reorganizing finances in Wu'an. The Taihang Branch, based on a letter from Comrade Wang Qingyu of the Wu'an Finance and Grain Section, believes that "two-thirds from the fruits of struggle" is "Xiang Ming grasping some facts and exaggerating them." Comrade Wang Qingyu, on the other hand, said: "Everyone was very unhappy when they saw it." What is the true picture of the facts? This still deserves further study. We believe that "exaggerating shortcomings" and "exaggerating advantages" are not "seeking truth from facts" attitudes. News reports that serve the people should be completely truthful. State one part of goodness as one part and do not hide any shortcomings. Although Comrade Xiang Ming's statement of "two-thirds" may have been somewhat exaggerated, the existence of bias can also be seen from Comrade Wang Qingyu's letter. This kind of courage to point out shortcomings is beneficial to both readers and work. Comrade Wang Qingyu pointed out that "Weisushan used the fruits of struggle for community-run projects" and "in villages with poor performance in the new district, it is also possible to use simple methods and use the fruits as funds." These situations were not mentioned in the contribution from the Taihang Branch (see this newspaper on the 1st). We believe this is very important. As for how many villages actually have this bias, and how many villages "reorganize feudal things and organize labor to move towards self-sufficiency in production," this still requires in-depth investigation before a definitive understanding can be reached. Comrade Xiang Ming should also explain the basis of his argument.

### 关于武安整理财政问题
太行分社

第2版()
专栏：来函照登

　　关于武安整理财政问题总分社同志：
    人民日报本月二日发表向明对武安整财意见一稿，与该报一日二版发表我们发去武安成绩一稿，有所矛盾，经我们调查是向明抓住一些事实扩大了的，现将武安来信寄去，请收阅处理。
    另外我们所发之稿，是依据武安整财工作组刘庚龙、邵永化、乔佩琦、朱翰增四同志来稿写成的，特此函告。  （太行分社）
    附武安县政府财粮科王庆余同志给太行新华日报的信：
    新华日报社：来信收到，武安整理村财政按实报导，人民日报本月二日二版披露有三分之二用斗争果实，大家一看都很不高兴，杨向明是专署二科一个同志，来武安工作，到三区魏粟山，那个区是新区，又不是个进步村，用斗争果实作民办亦是事实，在新区工作不好的村庄，亦可能用简单办法，用果实作基金，是很少数的，大半是整理封建东西和组织劳力，走向生产自给。向明未报导以前，领导上就注意滥用斗争果实现象，各别村庄坚决退还群众。敬礼
    王庆余（财粮科印）
    编者按：关于武安整理财政问题，太行分社立即进行调查，这是很好的。太行分社根据武安财粮科王庆余同志来信，认为“三分之二用斗争果实”是“向明抓住一些事实扩大了的”。而王庆余同志则说：“大家一看都很不高兴。”事实真象如何，还值得继续研究。我们认为：“扩大缺点”与“扩大优点”都不是“实事求是”的态度。为人民服务的新闻通讯，应该完全真实的，有一分好处说一分，有了缺点也不要掩饰。向明同志所说“三分之二”虽可能扩大了些，但偏向的存在，从王庆余同志信中也可看出，这种敢于指出缺点，对读者对工作都有益处。王庆余同志所指出的“魏粟山用斗争果实作民办亦是事实”，“在新区工作不好的村庄，亦可能用简单办法用果实作基金”，这些情况，在太行分社来稿（见一日本报）中却没有提到（我们认为这是很重要的）。至于有这种偏向的村庄实有多少，以及“整理封建东西和组织劳力，走向生产自给”的村庄实有多少，仍须深入调查后才能确实了解。向明同志亦应说明立论的根据。
