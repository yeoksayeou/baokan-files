Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 19th. Millions of liberated people in Northeast China are enthusiastically supporting the Democratic Allied Forces' autumn offensive. The ranks of the people supporting the front stretch from the Central Changchun Railway, along the Liaodong and Beining lines, to the Songhua River coast in the rear, day and night. In areas such as Tonghua and Benxi in Liaodong Province, which were recovered during the summer offensive, expeditionary stretcher teams accompanied the army. A grand review of stretchers was held in Tonghua City before departure. The civilian workers carefully studied and modified the stretchers to make them extremely comfortable for lying down or sitting. They also put forward the slogan "Bad people are not allowed to be expeditionary team members" and automatically reviewed the composition of the team members. The city has now dispatched more than 7,000 people, including 1,000 stretchers and 250 carts. Farmers in Erdaogangzi, Panshi, slaughtered pigs to welcome the participants in the war. They all wore new cotton-padded clothes and rushed to the front. When the stretcher team in Liaoyuan (i.e., Zhengjiatun), Liaobei Province, was dispatched this time, a grand review of 20,000 people was also held. 800 out of 1,200 carts in Xi'an were dispatched as soon as they heard the call. Even though the station had stopped accepting registration from the masses' "wartime service teams," stretcher teams organized by various counties automatically poured to the front. Farmer Hong Shunzhang from Dongfeng drove his newly bought three red horses to the front. The participants in the war from the far rear provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, Mudanjiang, and Songjiang are rushing to the front day and night. Everyone is vying to participate in the war. In a village in Hulan, only nine people were required, but 90 people automatically signed up. In Chaoyang District of Yanji City, more than 1,300 people signed up. An old man, Cui Shihe, and his three sons in the district argued with the township government to go. Another old man, Cui Zaixun, immediately sold his calf and bought a big cow when he heard about the war, and asked to go on the expedition with the cow. After the mobilization order was issued, countless farmers replaced their old carts with new ones, arguing about which cart was better when they signed up, asking to go first. The women made new cotton-padded clothes for the expedition members. The participants in the war also helped the newly liberated areas to turn over and publicize the policies of the liberated areas at the front. The Mulan wartime service team helped the local people in Chaoyang Town to arrest traitors and bullies and fight against landlords. The Heilongjiang wartime service team wrote slogans and performed "Li Xiaoer Joins the Army" everywhere.

　　Workers in various places are also enthusiastically increasing production to ensure supplies to the front. The First and Second Clothing Factories of the Liaodong Military Region automatically increased working hours and rushed to make winter clothes day and night. Ling Mu, a worker at the machinery repair factory, worked day and night and repaired more than 100 sewing machines in a week. More than a thousand women in Ji'an poured into factories to rush to make military uniforms. In addition to actively participating in the war and serving, the people in various places in eastern Hebei also launched a donation campaign to support the front. According to incomplete statistics from Qian'an, Lulong, Ninghe, and Zunhua counties alone: donations reached 4.24 million border currency, 1.26 million catties of grain, 25,000 catties of horse feed, 15,000 pairs of military shoes, and 170,000 catties of firewood.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 16th. The Zhengjiatun (i.e., Liaoyuan) to Baichengzi (i.e., Nong'an) railway, which is more than 500 miles long, was officially repaired and opened to traffic at the beginning of this month. From then on, the line is connected to Tao(an)ang(angxi) in the north, and forms a cross with the Tao(an)suo(lun) two branch lines in the west, and is completely connected to the West Manchuria railway network. The successful completion of this project is due to the hard work of all employees and liberated farmers for 40 days. Although they were frequently strafed and bombed by Chiang's planes or in heavy rain, they always had high morale and never slackened in their repair work. A farmer in Zhenmai County was injured by a road wood, and everyone advised him to rest. He said, "This is a railway for liberation, what does it matter if my hand is a little injured!" And he finally insisted on working. The Northeast Railway Bureau sent a telegram to congratulate, saying: The completion of this project not only increases the mileage of the railway for the people in the liberated areas, but also greatly shortens the distance between the rear and the front in terms of time, so that we can more quickly support the front line's counter-offensive through the new line and completely defeat the thief Chiang's "Second Manchuria" rule as soon as possible.

　　东北广大翻身人民夜以继日支援前线
    【新华社东北十九日电】东北千百万翻身人民，正热烈支援民主联军的秋季攻势，人民支前的行列自中长前线，辽东与北宁沿线，迤逶至后方松花江沿岸，日夜不停。夏季攻势中收复之辽东通化与本溪某区等地，均有远征担架队随军。通化市并曾于出发前举行担架大检阅，民工们精心研究，把担架改造得躺卧均极舒适，并提出“坏人不准当远征队员”的口号，自动审查了队员的成份。该市刻已出动七千余人，计担架千付，大车二百五十辆。磐石二道岗子的农民并杀猪欢送参战人员，他们均穿着新棉衣争上前线。辽北省之辽源（即郑家屯）此次担架队出动时，亦曾举行二万人大检阅。西安一千二百辆大车中有八百辆，一闻号召即出动，甚至兵站已停止接受群众“战勤队”报到，各县自动组织之担架队仍涌向前线。东丰农民洪顺章赶着翻身后新买的三匹枣红大马上了前线。远后方吉林、合江、牡丹江、松江等省的参战人员，均夜以继日的奔赴前线。人人争着参战，呼兰某村仅规定出九人，自动报名者达九十人，延吉市之朝阳区报名者一千三百余人，该区崔时鹤老汉父子三人在乡政府争着要去，另一老汉崔载勋听说参战，立即将小牛卖了买成大牛，牵上牛要求出征。动员令下后，无数农民将旧大车换成新大车，报名时争嚷自己的车好，要求先去。妇女们则为出征人员赶制了新棉衣。参战人员在前线并帮助新解放区翻身，宣传解放区政策。木兰战勤队在朝阳镇帮助当地人民逮捕奸霸，斗争地主，合江战勤队到处写标语，出演“李小二参军”。
    各地工人亦热烈增产保证前方供应。辽东军区第一、二被服厂，自动增加工作时间，日夜赶制冬衣。修械厂工人凌慕废寝忘餐，于一星期中修好缝纫机百余台。辑安千余妇女涌入工厂，赶制军装。冀东各地人民除积极参战服务外，并掀起支前捐款运动，仅迁安、芦龙、宁河、遵化四县不完全统计：献金达边币四百二十四万元，粮食达一百二十六万斤，马料二万五千斤，军鞋一万五千双，及干柴十七万斤。
    【新华社东北十六日电】全长五百余里的郑家屯（即辽源）至白城子（即农安）铁路已于本月初正式修复通车，自此该线北接洮（安）昂（昂溪），西与洮（安）索（伦）两支线构成十字形，而与西满铁路网完全连成一气。此一工程之胜利完成，乃由于全体员工及翻身农民四十天艰苦奋斗的结果，他们虽在蒋机频繁扫射轰炸或大雨滂沱中，亦始终情绪极高，对修筑工作从未松懈。镇麦县某农民手被道木压伤后大家劝他休息，他说：“这是修翻身铁路，我的手破伤一点算个啥！”而终于一直坚持工作。东北铁路总局特驰电祝贺称：这一工程的完成，不但增加了解放区人民铁路的里程，而且是在时间上大大缩短了后方与前方的距离使我们更迅速的通过新线路支援前线大反攻，早日彻底打倒蒋贼“二满洲”统治。
