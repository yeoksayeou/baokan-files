　　【Report from Taiyue, This Newspaper, 29th】Southern Shanxi counties commend militiamen and boatmen who returned victoriously after participating in the war supporting the counter-offensive army. When the Chen-Xie army went south, the Pinglu militia actively cooperated, escorting hospital units, searching for scattered soldiers and clearing out Chiang bandits along the southern bank of the Yellow River and the Longhai Railway, achieving considerable results. The District Military Commission issued a circular on the 17th to commend the meritorious militiamen. Secondly, after the Linjin boatmen and sailors who transported the Chen-Xie army across the river returned, the county democratic government held a banquet in their honor. The sailors were all excited. Shang Ziqing said, "What kind of world was it when I was forced to ferry the 'disaster army'? They ate meat and drank wine, but gave us mud and water to drink, and we were so hungry that we had to tighten our belts. This time, following the Eighth Route Army, the first meal was meat buns, and there was meat and cigarettes, and the life was even better than the Eighth Route Army. They had fifty yuan for food a day, and we had one hundred yuan. We don't have to worry about clothes when the weather gets cold. After returning, I heard that the land at home has been cultivated by the substitute cultivation team; who is family and who is the enemy, isn't it clear?" Then, many people, including Jia Jiangzi, Wang Gangwa, and Chen Zhenghui, unanimously agreed that the Eighth Route Army is the people's army and demanded to be organized to work with the Eighth Route Army to the end! The Liberation Sailors Committee was immediately established, and Jia Jiangzi and others were elected as five committee members, and three disciplines were set: 1. Do not privately struggle against the target to cross the river. 2. Do not transport prohibited items. 3. Continue to support the Eighth Route Army's counter-offensive. Liu Zihai, Chen Zhenghui and other five river-crossing heroes were elected.
    【Report from Taiyue, This Newspaper, 29th】On September 12, after hearing that Li Xishun and other thirty-odd bandits from Wei Ansheng's bandit gang had gone to Xitan to rob grain, the Du Balian militia's water heroes actively prepared to eliminate the bandits. At 7 pm, six heroes, including Li Fuyu, Qu Lichao, and Zhang Zuoyu, carrying weapons, went into the water from ×× and floated across Xitan (five li wide). At this time, the enemy was making a fire on the edge of the village, and Li Fuyu and others immediately launched a fierce shooting and bombing attack, driving the enemy into the water and fleeing without taking a single grain. After we recovered Potou, Wei Ansheng's bandit gang frequently robbed grain in the areas of Xiayuan, Nantan, and Nanbaipo on the south bank of Henan.

  　杜八联民兵泅水五里出击
    【本报太岳二十九日电】晋南各县表扬随反攻大军南下支前参战胜利归来的民兵与船夫。在陈谢大军南下时，平陆民兵曾积极配合行动，护送兵站医院，并在黄河南岸沿河一带及陇海路上搜索散兵，肃清蒋匪，获得不少成绩。分区武委会特于十七日通令表扬有功民兵。其次，送陈谢大军渡河的临晋船夫水手归来后，该县民主政府特设宴招待，各位水手个个兴奋，尚子庆说：“我从前被逼着渡‘遭殃军’时，那是什么世道？人家吃肉喝酒，给咱喝土泥水，饿得受不了，腰带只往里勒。这次跟八路军，第一顿就是肉包子，又有肉、又有烟，生活比八路军还好，他们一天五十元菜金，我们是一百元。天气冷了，也不愁衣服。回来后，听说家里的地已让代耕队给代耕好；谁是一家人，谁是敌人，还不清楚吗？”接着，有贾江子、王刚娃、陈正辉等多人，一致认为八路军是人民的军队，要求组织起来，跟八路军一块干到底！当即成立了解放水手委员会，选出贾江子等五人为委员，并订出三项纪律：一、不私自斗争对象过河。二、不渡违禁物品。三、继续支援八路军反攻。并选出刘子海、陈正辉等五位渡河英雄。
    【本报太岳二十九日电】杜八联民兵水上英雄，于九月十二日，闻讯卫安生匪部李喜顺等三十余人，到西滩抢粮后，即积极准备消灭该匪。下午七时，由英雄李傅玉、璩立超、张作玉等六人，携带武器，由××处下水浮过西滩（宽五里），此时敌人正在村边烧火，李傅玉等当即猛烈射击投弹，将敌人打得落水而逃，未抢走一颗粮食，他们在任务完成后安全撤退，战果不明。按自我收复坡头后，惯匪卫安生部即于河南岸之霞院、南滩、南白坡一带，经常四出抢粮。
