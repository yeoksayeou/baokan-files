　　US and Britain Interfere in the Internal Affairs of Balkan Countries
  　Soviet Union, Poland and Other Countries Sternly Denounce
    The Truth About the Greek Question is Revealed to the World
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th】Comprehensive Report: Since the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the Greek question on September 24, it has undergone intense debate and completed all deliberations on October 13. Superficially, the US proposal was adopted while the Soviet proposal was rejected, but in reality, the Soviet Union "won an indisputable moral and political victory" (TASS, October 15), allowing the world to understand the truth about the Greek question, which is purely due to US and British interference in Greece's internal affairs. The US proposal is divided into two parts: one is to request the UN General Assembly to establish a special committee to supervise the so-called border disputes between Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania and Greece; the other is to suggest that the UN General Assembly condemn Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania for aiding and supporting the Greek guerrillas. The former part was passed on the 8th under US manipulation; the latter part, during the debate, the United States realized that it was in the wrong and declared its withdrawal, and Britain and France came forward with "amendments." The entire motion was also passed on the 11th with a majority of 36 votes, but the opposing countries included the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia and other six countries, and those indirectly refusing to support the United States included ten abstaining countries and five countries that did not participate in the voting. Representatives from the Soviet Union and several countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia spoke one after another, sternly denouncing the conspiracies of the United States, Britain, and France to interfere in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania; and resolutely stated that they would not participate in the work of the special supervisory committee. Vyshinsky said: American newspapers have frankly given this committee a nickname "called the 'Balkan Watchdog'." The Soviet proposal was voted on section by section on the 13th, the main parts of which were two: the first part was: the Greek government should be responsible for the border incidents between Greece and Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania; the situation in Greece is serious due to the struggle between the Greek people and the anti-democratic forces around the current government; the current situation in Greece is to a considerable extent the result of foreign interference in Greece's internal affairs; the second part was to withdraw foreign troops and military personnel stationed in Greece. During the vote, the first part was supported by eight countries including Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and India, and ten representative countries did not want to echo the United States and ignored it, and 39 votes under US manipulation opposed it. In the second part, eight countries including Poland and India supported it, sixteen countries abstained, and 34 countries under US manipulation voted against it. When the entire Soviet proposal was voted on, eleven countries were also neutral. This situation proves that a considerable number of representatives are unwilling to follow the United States.

　　美英干涉巴尔干各国内政
  　苏波等国严正指斥
    希腊问题真象大白于世
    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合报导：联大政治安全小组委员会自上月二十四讨论希腊问题以来，迭经激烈辩论，已于本月十三日完成全部审议。在表面上，美国提案获得通过而苏联提案遭受否决，但实际上，苏联“却赢得了无可争辩的道义上与政治上的胜利”（塔斯社十五日电），使世界了解希腊问题的真象，纯系美英干涉希腊内政所致。美国提案共分两部分，一为要求联大成立一个特别委员会，以监督所谓南、保、阿三国与希腊边境之纠纷；一为建议联大谴责南、保、阿三国援助与支持希腊游击队。前一部分在美国操纵下，于八日通过；后一部分则在辩论过程中，美国自知理穷而声明撤回，另由英法出面提出“修正案”。整个议案，亦于十一日以三十六票的形式多数通过，但反对的有苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克、波兰、南斯拉夫等六国，间接拒绝支持美国的有弃权的十国及不参加投票的五国。苏联及波、捷、南等若干国家代表，先后发言，均严正指责美英法妄图干涉南、保、阿三国内政之阴谋；且坚决表示不参加特别监督委员会的工作。维辛斯基称：这个委员会美国报纸已直爽地给它取了个绰号“叫做‘巴尔干看家狗’。”苏联的提案则于十三日举行逐段表决，其中主要部分有二，第一部分为：希腊与南、保、阿三国边界事件应由希腊政府负责；希腊国内形势乃因希腊人民与目前政府周围的反民主势力间的斗争而情形严重；希腊今日的情形在相当的程度上是外国干涉希腊内政的结果；第二部分为撤退外国驻希腊军队与军事人员。表决时，第一部分南、捷与印度等八国投票赞成，十个代表国不愿附和美国之反对而不顾，美国操纵下的三十九票反对。第二部分波、印度等八国赞成，十六国弃权，美国操纵下的三十四国投反对票。整个苏联提案在表决时，亦有十一国中立。此种情形证明了相当多数的代表不愿跟在美国后面走。
