Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Reports from all sources: For the past four weeks, the Soviet delegation's exposure of war-mongers and its just stance of defending peace and maintaining the United Nations at the UN General Assembly has increasingly isolated the destructive activities of American imperialism. The establishment of the Liaison Bureau by the Communist Parties of nine European countries has further shocked and unsettled the international reactionaries headed by the United States and will affect the current alignment at the UN General Assembly. According to a United Press dispatch from Lake Success on the 6th: The announcement of this news "is consistent with the growing awareness among UN representatives; as representatives have recognized that America's earlier promise to promote a strong UN plan to gain leadership has now failed." "Small countries will watch a comprehensive political war for moral leadership in Western Europe in the coming months." The difficult situation of the United States at the UN General Assembly, according to the dispatch, is shown by: "The US nomination of Australia's Evatt for President of the General Assembly has been defeated." On the issue of refusing to elect Ukraine to replace Poland's seat on the Security Council, the United States is also in the "minority." On the so-called "Greek border dispute," the United States was also forced to retreat and propose: "If Southern, Argentine, and Bulgarian countries are willing to accept the UN's new note and cooperate with it, the United States is willing to withdraw its original severe criticism of these three countries." Marshall's proposal to establish a "Temporary Committee on Peace and Security" "received only a lukewarm response, even from Britain, a close ally of the United States." Vyshinsky's condemnation of the war-mongers, "the US delegation is still undecided on how to respond." After the news of the establishment of the Liaison Bureau by the Communist Parties of nine countries reached London and Washington, the US and British authorities were extremely flustered. According to British and American news agencies: "Washington officials were surprised by this." The State Department stated that it "will study it carefully," while a British Foreign Office spokesman claimed on the 6th: "We are working hard to study the development of the situation."

　　欧洲九国共产党建立联络局
  　美反动派极为惊恐
    在联合国大会上处境益困窘
    【新华社陕北九日电】各方讯：四周来，苏联代表团在联大揭发战争贩子，及其保卫和平维护联合国的正义立场，已使美帝国主义在联大的破坏活动日益陷于孤立。欧洲九国共产党联络局的建立，更使以美国为首的国际反动派大为震惊和不安，并将影响联大目前的阵营。据合众社成功湖六日电透露：此项消息之宣布，“适于联合国各代表间日趋增长之认识相符合；因各代表都已认识美国前承诺将促成有力之联合国计划，以获取领导权一事，今已告失败。”“各小国将在今后数月中观看争取西欧道义上领导权之全面政治战。”美国在联大处境之困窘，据该电报导称：“美国提名澳国伊瓦特为大会主席已被击败。”在拒绝选举乌克兰代替安理会中之波兰席位问题上，美国也处在“少数方面”。在所谓“希腊边境纠纷问题”上，美国被迫亦不得不退而提出：“若南、阿、保三国愿意接受联合国之新照会并与其合作，则美国愿撤消其原来对该三国之严厉抨击。”马歇尔关于成立“和平安全临时委员会”之建议，“仅获得冷淡的反响，即美国密切的友邦英国亦如此。”维辛斯基对战争贩子的斥责，“美代表团如何应付，仍举棋不定。”九国共产党联络局建立之消息传至伦敦、华府后，美英当局极度慌乱。据英美通讯社透露：“华府人士对此惊讶不已。”国务院表示“将细加研究”，英外交部发言人则于六日声称：“刻正极力研讨情势之发展。”
