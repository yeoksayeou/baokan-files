Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 12th—A large number of cadres from the border region are successively and enthusiastically going south to take up the most glorious work. Three hundred graduates from the artillery team of the Military and Political University and graduates from the Medical College of Northern University have successively gone south. A part of the cadres of the Border Region Government has also signed up to participate in the southward movement, and the first batch has already departed. Local cadres in various counties are even more enthusiastic in requesting to go south. Hengshui County, Ji'nan, recently held a meeting to commend meritorious service in the southward movement. At the meeting, 120 out of 200 cadres signed up. At the end of last month, 22 district and village cadres in the Fourth District of Yangcheng County, Taiyue, eagerly signed up. When the second batch of more than 70 district and village cadres in Ci County, Taihang, went south, they said to the thousands of liberated farmers who were seeing them off: "We will not return until the farmers in the South have overthrown the landlords." Also: The Taihang Administrative Office recently promulgated a preferential treatment method for the families of political and civilian cadres on the expedition. It stipulates that the families of cadres transferred to other areas should be treated as military dependents, and governments at all levels should pay attention to organizing their production so as to maintain the living standards of the general public. Those who are poor, their wives and children attending school shall enjoy the treatment of public-funded students.
