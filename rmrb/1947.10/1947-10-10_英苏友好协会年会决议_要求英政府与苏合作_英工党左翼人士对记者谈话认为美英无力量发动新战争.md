Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: London dispatch: The Anglo-Soviet Friendship Association held its grand annual meeting here starting from the 4th. In addition to many representatives of the association, there were also representatives from many fraternal associations, including Professor Nicole from the Franco-Soviet Friendship Association, Singer from the Belgian-Soviet Friendship Association, Ms. Herda Curling, representative of the Irish-Soviet Association, Booth, representative of the All-India Society of Friends of the Soviet Union, and Dr. Lambled, representative of the Greek-Soviet Association. The meeting proceeded in an atmosphere of friendship and harmony, fully demonstrating the spirit of friendship of the people of Western European countries in strengthening international unity and cooperation with the Soviet Union. The Anglo-Soviet Friendship Association was established in March 1946, formed by the merger of the British "Today Russia" Association, the Anglo-Soviet Unity National Committee, and many other groups. The association now has 128 branches, spread across most cities in England and Wales, with 6,000 individual members. Many joint labor unions and cooperative organizations have joined, and it has the support of many trade unions that have not yet formally joined.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS London dispatch: At the first meeting (4th) of the annual meeting of the Anglo-Soviet Friendship Association held here, Stanle Evans, chairman of the association's executive committee, served as chairman of the annual meeting, reporting on the association's activities over the past year and future work plans. The meeting passed an important resolution, calling on all the British people to uphold the policy of Anglo-Soviet friendship and strive to keep the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty effective. The proposer of the motion, writer and journalist Sloan, said: "Cooperation with the Soviet Union is the only guarantee of world peace." He pointed out: "Although the Labour government is conducting a daily alliance with American imperialism and turning the Anglo-Soviet treaty into waste paper, the interests of peace, European reconstruction, and the needs of the British economy all require the closest cooperation and friendship with the Soviet Union." Shaffer supported this motion, strongly criticizing those like McNair, "those guys who try to undermine international cooperation and are anti-Soviet." He pointed out that the policies of these people "are a continuation of the same policy during the war of preventing the opening of a second battlefield and aiming to weaken the Soviet Union." He concluded by emphasizing: "The enemies of peace are targeting the Soviet Union, but their attempts are doomed to fail, because the Soviet Union firmly believes in its strength and will never be intimidated by this evil force. The major interest of the British people lies in friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union." The meeting also passed another motion demanding the resumption of business negotiations with the Soviet Union. At the second meeting on the 5th, after the representatives had a heated discussion on the executive committee's report, they unanimously resolved that the association would increase individual membership to 10,000 by next March, and passed a plan to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, and elected the association's national council. Evans was re-elected as chairman, and Forman was elected as secretary.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS Prague dispatch, 2nd: A delegation of the British Labour Party parliamentary group has recently arrived in Czechoslovakia for a visit. The head of the delegation, Mr. Zilliacus, a left-wing member of the Labour Party, strongly criticized the American imperialists for inciting a new war and their aggressive policies when he met with Czech reporters. His answer to whether the world is threatened by a new war was negative. He pointed out: "The United States cannot force the people to agree to total mobilization"; and he claimed: "The British working class does not want to fight the Soviet Union. Two-thirds of the British people are willing to establish closer relations with the Soviet Union. Every Briton understands that no matter who wins the war, Britain will always lose." Zilliacus continued: "The Labour Party is very skeptical about the Marshall Plan. The United States is not giving gifts, so a prudent and intelligent policy must be implemented." When discussing the US "aid" to Greece and Turkey, he condemned: The United States is pursuing an aggressive policy in the Middle East and supporting fascism. He described the German question, saying: "After traveling in Germany, I believe that German workers do not support the capitalist rule in West Germany. The era of the Weimar Republic is gone forever. Mines and industries must be nationalized." When asked whether Britain would stop nationalization, he replied: "The Labour Party believes that if this measure fails, there may be a cabinet crisis. Regarding compensation to the original owners of nationalized enterprises, the Labour Party believes that the government is too generous. The Labour Party Left insists that workers should participate more widely in the management of state-owned enterprises." Zilliacus finally pointed out: "The Labour Party delegation intends to visit Poland, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union again. For the future of Britain, we must thoroughly study the economic and political problems of these countries and their solutions, and improve relations between Britain and these countries as soon as possible."

　　英苏友好协会年会决议
  　要求英政府与苏合作
  　英工党左翼人士对记者谈话认为美英无力量发动新战争
    【新华社陕北八日电】伦敦讯：英苏友好协会于四日起在此间举行盛大年会。与会者除该协会的许多代表外，尚有许多兄弟协会的代表，其中包括法苏友好协会的尼哥勒教授，比苏友好协会的辛格尔，爱尔兰苏联协会代表赫尔达克丁女士，全印苏联之友协会代表布斯，以及希苏协会代表拉姆布利德博士等；会议在洋溢着友谊与和洽的空气中进行，充分表现了西欧各国人民与苏联加强国际团结与合作的友谊精神。按英苏友好协会成立于一九四六年三月，由英国之今日俄罗斯协会、英苏团结全国委员会及其他许多团体合并组成，该协会现拥有分会一二八个，遍布英格兰及威尔斯之大部城市，现在个人会员六千人，许多联工会及合作团体均已加入；并得到许多尚未正式入会的职工会的支持。
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：在此间召开的英、苏友好协会年会的第一次会议（四日）上，由该协会执委会主席斯丹莱、伊凡斯任年会主席，报告该协会一年来的活动，及将来工作计划。会议通过了一项重要决议，号召英国全体人民一本英、苏友好政策，力使英、苏同盟条约继续有效。该案提议人作家兼记者斯劳恩力称：“与苏合作是世界和平的唯一保证。”他指出：“虽然工党政府与美帝国主义进行日常的同盟，并把英、苏条约变成废纸，但和平的利益、欧洲重建及英国的经济的需要，都要求与苏联最亲密的合作与友谊。”莎佛尔支持此议案，力斥如麦克纳尔之流的“那些企图破坏国际合作与反苏的家伙”。他指出：这些人的政策“是战时阻止开辟第二战场且以削弱苏联为目的之同一政策的继续”，他结语强调说：“和平的敌人针对着苏联，但其企图注定要失败的，因为苏联坚信其力量，决不为这种恶势力所唬住。英国人民的重大利益在于与苏友好合作。”会议并通过了另一议案，要求恢复与苏联的商务谈判。五日的第二次会上，各代表在热烈讨论执委会报告后，一致决议该协会至明年三月增加个入会员至一万人，并通过纪念苏联十月革命三十周年计划，并选举了该协会的全国理事会，伊凡斯重选为主席，福尔曼被选为书记。
    【新华社陕北四日电】据塔斯社布拉格二日讯：英工党国会党团代表团顷抵达捷克访问，该代表团团长工党左翼人士齐里亚库斯在接见捷记者时，极力抨击美帝国主义分子挑拨新战争及其侵略政策。他对世界是否受新战争威胁的答复是否定的，他指出：“美国不能强迫人民同意总动员”；并力称：“英国工人阶级不欲与苏联作战，英国人民的三分之二，是愿意和苏联建立更密切的关系。每个英国人都懂得：不管谁赢得战争，英国总是要输的”。齐氏继称：“工党对马歇尔计划甚表怀疑，美国并不是送礼，因此必须实行谨慎而聪明之政策。”在论及美国对希、土之“援助”时，他谴责：美国在中东正实行侵略政策，并支持法西斯主义。他叙述德国问题说：“我在德国游玩后，相信德国工人是不拥护德国西部的资本家统治。丽玛共和国时代已经一去不复返了。矿山与工业必须国有。”当询以英国是否将停止国有化时他答称：“工党的意见认为，如此项措施失败，则可能有内阁危机。关于对国有化企业原业主的赔偿，工党认为政府太慷慨了，工党左翼坚持在管理国有企业方面，工人应更广泛的参加。”齐氏最后指出：“工党代表团打算再访问波兰、南斯拉夫及苏联，为了英国的将来，我们一定要澈底研究这些国家的经济政治问题及其解决之办法，而且尽快改善英国与这些国家的关系。”
