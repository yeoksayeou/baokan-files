　　Inspect Wheat Planting to Overcome Complacency
  　Wuan Second District Finds Few Poor and Hired Peasants Planting Wheat
    [Report from this newspaper, Wuan] The Second District convened a meeting of all district cadres on the 17th to inspect wheat planting achievements. Out of a total of 140,258 mu of irrigated and dry land in the district, 72,834 mu have been planted, accounting for a little over 51.9% of the total land. According to calculations by the masses in Lianghu and Dawang Village, planting "straight wheat" (wheat planted directly without prior soaking) saves half a jin of seeds per mu compared to planting "late wheat." The main reason for the rapid wheat planting is the organization of a large number of women as semi-auxiliary labor to participate in the autumn harvest. In many villages such as Rujiao and Ximazhuang, millet and mung beans were completely harvested by women and children, so male laborers could concentrate their efforts specifically on planting wheat. Secondly, setting wages or allocating shares based on the amount of work done improved labor efficiency. For example, in several villages like Xihu, male laborers carried back millet from 2,989 mu and mung beans from 122 mu at night. Because the organization of wheat planting was swift and the results were great, it caused complacency among district and village cadres, who felt that wheat planting was not a problem. After a stratified inspection, many problems were discovered: First, poor and hired peasants did not have good land or had little land, lacked seeds, and lacked animal power. For example, in Dongmazhuang, a poor peasant household with four people only planted 2.5 mu of wheat because they did not have good land. There were also many poor and hired peasants who could not afford wages and only planted two or three mu of wheat because they lacked seeds and animal power. Second, landlords still controlled large amounts of good land. For example, landlord Bu Side in Hequ Village, with four people, still planted 52.5 mu of land, yielding more than 1.3 shi of grain per mu. On the other hand, Bu Guide, a poor peasant with two people, planted 7.5 mu of land, yielding 1 shi of grain per mu. Forty-five struggle targets harvested over 200 shi of millet alone. In Xihu, seven landlords were still planting over 300 mu of land, which the masses were very concerned about. When the masses in Hequ discovered that landlords were still leaving over 220 mu of good land vacant, they first planted this land with "straight wheat" and planted their own bad land with "late wheat" to prevent themselves from suffering losses when the land was exchanged after the autumn harvest. Xihu forced landlords to plant wheat, and Ximazhuang simply distributed the landlords' unplanted irrigated land to poor and hired peasants who did not have irrigated land for planting wheat. Except for the above three villages, other villages did not pay attention to this issue. Even now, there is still a lot of landlords' land that can be planted with wheat but is not being planted, which will be a loss. After these problems were raised, everyone became alert. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed that the time for wheat planting was short, and all efforts should be concentrated on solving the difficulties of poor and hired peasants in planting wheat.

　　检查种麦克服自满
  　武安二区发现贫雇种麦不多
    【本报武安讯】二区十七日召开全区区干部会，检查种麦成绩，全区十四万零二百五十八亩水旱地，已种七万二千八百卅四亩，占总土地百分之五十一点九强，根据两湖、大王村群众计算，直麦比晚麦每亩省斤半种。种麦快的主要原因，是组织了大批妇女半辅劳力参加了收秋。儒教、西马庄等许多村，谷子绿豆完全是妇女儿童割的，因此男劳力能集中力量专门种麦。其次是按活规定工资或定分，提高了劳动效率。如西湖等几个村男劳力，夜间担回二千九百八十九亩谷，一百二十二亩绿豆。由于组织种麦时间迅速，成绩很大，引起了区村干部自满，感到种麦不成问题。后经分阶层检查，发现了许多问题：首先是贫雇农没有好地或土地少。没种子，没畜力等困难，东马庄有个贫雇户。四口人只种了二亩半麦，原因是没好地，还有许多贫雇因出不起工资来，没种子，没畜力只种二、三亩麦子；其次是地主手里还掌握着大批的好地。如河渠村地主卜四得，四口人还种着五十二亩半地，每亩均一石三斗多产粮；而卜贵得是个贫农，二口人种七亩半地，每亩均一石产粮，四十五户斗争对象光谷子打了二百多石。西湖七个地主还种着三百多亩地，他们都是尽量少种麦，群众很关心这地；河渠群众发现地主还空着二百二十多亩好地时，就先把这些地种上直麦，自己坏地种上晚麦，防备秋后换了地自己吃亏；西湖强迫地主种上麦，西马庄干脆把地主不种麦的水地分给没水地种麦的贫雇农。除了以上三个村，其他村就没注意这个问题，直到现在还有好多地主的地能种麦而不种，这将是一个损失。这些问题提出后，大家警惕起来了，最后一致认为：种麦时间短了，应集中全力解决贫雇农种麦困难。
