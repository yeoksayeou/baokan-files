Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. The massive plan of U.S. imperialism to invade South China is being gradually implemented with the active assistance of the Chiang bandit traitor government. According to a TASS Shanghai dispatch on the 3rd, citing news from the Kuomintang Shen Bao: In order to implement its invasion plan regarding the construction of sixteen industrial enterprises in Guangdong and Guangxi, including paper mills, cement plants, alkali acid factories, and coal mines, a U.S. banking group has decided to invest $180 million in the "light and heavy industrial construction" of the two provinces. U.S. engineers will be responsible for "technical" aspects of the plan's implementation. This plan has been approved by the Chiang government.

In addition, according to a United Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 3rd to the Guomin Times Guangzhou, Rockefeller III, the oil magnate who came to China in mid-September, met with Song Ziwen, the newly appointed chairman of Guangdong Province under Chiang's regime, on the 2nd to discuss the "South China investment issue" and has reached a certain agreement. The newspaper also reported that Song Ziwen will implement new traitorous economic measures in Guangdong, such as dredging Huangpu Port to serve as a U.S. imperialist military and economic invasion base, and building various factories controlled by Americans. He has also drafted a so-called three-year "construction" plan for Guangdong to actively assist his American masters in invading China.

According to various news reports, in addition to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, the Chiang government has also sold the economic development rights of South China to the United States in Hunan Province. The contract for this plan was signed as early as May of this year by the Chiang side and Penny, the person in charge of the American Penny Lee Corporation who came to China. The plan stipulates that industries invested in and directly managed by the United States, in addition to the above, also include gas, hydroelectric power, water conservancy, automobile manufacturing, shipbuilding, glass, and road construction. Penny himself serves as the "Senior Economic Advisor" to the Chiang regime's Guangdong and Guangxi provincial governments.

　　蒋介石积极出卖下美实施侵华南计划
  　投资两省一亿八千万元
    【新华社陕北六日电】美帝国主义侵略华南的庞大计划，正在蒋匪卖国政府积极帮助之下逐步付诸实施。据塔斯社上海三日电引国民党申报消息：美国为实行其侵略计划中关于在两广建设十六个工业企业，包括纸厂、水泥厂、碱酸工厂与煤矿等，美国银行团已决定将以一亿八千万美元的资本投资于该两省的“轻重工业建设。”并由美国工程师担任该项计划实施过程中“技术”方面的责任。该计划已由蒋政府批准。此外，据合众社三日由香港发电到国民时报广州电讯披露，上月中旬来华之煤油大王洛克菲勒第三，于二日曾与蒋记新任广东省主席宋子文会谈“华南投资问题”，并已取得某项协议。”该报并报导宋子文将在广东实行新的卖国经济措施，为疏浚黄埔港以供美帝作为军事经济侵略基地，及修建各种由美人控制之工厂等。并已拟定所谓广东三年“建设”计划，积极帮助其美国主子侵华。按照各方消息报导，蒋政府将华南经济开发权出卖与美者，除粤、桂二省外，尚有湖南省。此项计划之合同早于今年五月间由蒋方与美国来华之潘尼李氏总公司负责人潘尼订立。计划中规定由美国投资与直接管理之工业除上述者外，还包括煤气、水力发电、水利、汽车制造、造船、玻璃以及修筑公路等部门。潘尼本人则任蒋记粤、桂两省政府之“高等经济顾问。”
