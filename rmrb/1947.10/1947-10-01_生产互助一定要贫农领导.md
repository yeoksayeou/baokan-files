　　Production Mutual Aid Must Be Led by Poor Peasants
    Li Zhuang
    Some comrades say: "Ordinary peasants participating in mutual aid often have three major concerns: fear of suffering losses, fear of lack of freedom, and fear of trouble. Therefore, when organizing mutual aid and rectifying mutual aid, these issues must be resolved first." Recent research on several mutual aid groups in Qiuxian County revealed that those with the above three concerns are not "peasants," but middle peasants and above. As long as we let the poor peasants lead production mutual aid, these problems are easily solved, because poor peasants do not have these concerns.
    After the poor peasants turned themselves around, they obtained basic production conditions and urgently demanded to become prosperous, with the highest production enthusiasm. However, they still have difficulties, lacking livestock and farm tools. At this time, organizing mutual aid becomes a requirement as important as "production and getting rich." After the poor peasants participate in mutual aid, as long as technical issues such as work points are resolved, they will try their best to do a good job in mutual aid, which is a reflection of this demand.
    In the past, there was a habit of mutual aid in rural areas. Several poor peasants or a combination of poor peasants and middle peasants would use the livestock of the middle peasants, and the middle peasants would use the labor of the poor peasants. Although there was no precise calculation of work points, they would not disband for a long time. It seems very voluntary and equivalent, but it is not. At that time, the poor peasants had no livestock and no organization. They could not do anything without the middle peasants. When borrowing the livestock and tools of the middle peasants, they had to return labor to the middle peasants during the busiest farming seasons, such as wheat harvesting, sowing, and weeding. At this time, labor is the most expensive, and in reality, it is still not equivalent. Now that they have mutual aid, they are very satisfied because they are no longer taken advantage of by others. Therefore, there is no feeling of suffering losses.
    Mutual aid and collective labor reverse the habit of individual labor of peasants, and what is expressed is the lack of "freedom" of individual labor. However, poor peasants do not have a feeling of "unfreedom." In the past, when they borrowed other people's livestock, they were at the mercy of others. They would lend it to them whenever they wanted, and they had to return labor when others were the busiest (and labor was most valuable). Everything they had was decided by others, which was the most unfree. Now that they participate in mutual aid, they discuss with everyone what to do and what to do, and they feel more free than in the past.
    Poor peasants suffered the most oppression in the past and tasted the flavors of the world. They were taken advantage of too much by others in a "so-so" way. Today, when they participate in mutual aid, they are very serious about the issue of equivalence. The principle of "knowing beforehand and not suffering losses" is mainly proposed by poor peasants (the phenomenon of individual poor peasants with poor awareness wanting to take some small advantages from others is only a very small minority). Poor peasants in the mutual aid group do not pay special attention to "generosity" on the surface, but advocate "saying one thing at a time." This is an important key to consolidating mutual aid.
    The above situations all show that poor peasants rely on mutual aid the most, are most willing to have mutual aid, and understand that mutual aid is beneficial to them in every way. After the poor peasants turned themselves around and gained status, if they become the head of the mutual aid group or the captain, they will cherish the benefits and the status quo they have gained through hard struggle and try not to lose or damage it. When the disaster was the most serious in Qiuxian County, the government led the peasants to transport relief goods. There were 1,055 poor peasants in the transport team, who have completely become the backbone and foundation of today's mutual aid movement in the Qiuxian area. Thirty-five rich peasants were so hungry that they participated in the mutual aid transportation at that time. Later, when the year was slightly better, most of them withdrew. This historical fact powerfully shows that production mutual aid cannot be done well without the leadership of poor peasants.
    The middle peasants did not initially have an urgent demand to participate in mutual aid. Their family is a relatively complete production unit. Although they also needed the help of poor peasants during the busiest labor in the past, they had livestock and often belonged to the active and advantageous position. The three concerns mentioned above are mainly the thoughts of the middle peasants. They are unwilling to lose the undue advantages and status they had in the past. Before the land reform, the leadership advocated mutual aid, and the middle peasants of Lisheng Village also responded. Their most favorable condition than the poor peasants was that they had livestock and were afraid of suffering losses. Therefore, they proposed that cattle should not enter the mutual aid group. Some of them had their own cattle and only looked for other cattle-owning households to help each other. When harvesting wheat, they really felt that it was not enough to have only cattle without solving the problem of labor. After the wheat harvest, they actively demanded mutual aid with the poor peasants, forming a large-scale labor exchange after the wheat harvest. The middle peasant class is very sensitive, and they will quickly feel whether they are suffering losses or taking advantage, and quickly change their actions.
    After the land reform, a new situation appeared. The poor peasants had land and also received a part of farm tools, livestock, and floating wealth. The most difficult thing was that the livestock and farm tools were not enough. The method of joint investment and purchase could solve some difficulties. The method of mutual aid to buy farm tools and people pulling plows also solved some difficulties. They could barely cultivate the land without relying on the middle peasants. The middle peasants increased new difficulties, because the poor peasants all had enough land to cultivate themselves, and the number of short-term workers decreased unprecedentedly. They often could not find people when they were most short of manpower. There was a middle peasant household in Lisheng Village who participated in mutual aid. When he saw that the other five poor peasant households had not participated, he still wanted to use the old method to take advantage. He announced his withdrawal from the mutual aid group. Later, all five poor peasant households participated in mutual aid, and the object of taking advantage was completely lost. He had to rejoin. There was a middle peasant household in Dazhai who only wanted to take advantage in the mutual aid group and was very "sharp." The poor peasants advised him but he did not change. He was temporarily expelled to educate him. At that time, they were building a house. The poor peasants divided the materials and the mutual aid labor did not cost much money. They built the house well. This middle peasant had to hire people to build the house. The three rooms cost 240,000. He regretted it greatly at this time and expressed to the poor peasants that he must change and hoped to be re-admitted to the group.
    In addition to the objective reasons why the middle peasants had to participate in mutual aid, there was another reason, that is, after the land reform, they had a wrong impression of the struggle (equal distribution), were afraid of struggle, and were unwilling to let go of production and become prosperous. Because the poor peasants had the greatest say in the village, they were willing to get close to the poor peasants to show that they were one family with them. This is a good phenomenon. Only when the middle peasants rely on the poor peasants can they get the help and transformation of the poor peasants. However, checking the motives of the middle peasants to participate in mutual aid at this time, there are still some oppressive emotions. Many facts show that this is not terrible. As long as he gets benefits in mutual aid, this forced emotion will quickly change.
    Many materials show that mutual aid cannot be done well without the leadership of poor peasants. The proportion of middle peasants in rural areas is extremely large, and they must be well united and educated. The best way is to consciously cultivate several small groups with poor peasants as the leading backbone in the development of large-scale mutual aid movements to help do a good job in typical demonstrations, so as to educate and influence the middle peasants, and the mutual aid movement can be carried out steadily.

### 生产互助一定要贫农领导

　　生产互助一定要贫农领导
    李庄
    有些同志说：“一般农民参加互助，常有三大顾虑，怕吃亏、怕不自由、怕麻烦，因此在组织互助与整顿互助时，首先要解决这几个问题。”最近研究邱县若干互助组，发现具有以上三种顾虑的并非“农民”，而是中农以上的成份，只要放手让贫农领导生产互助，这些问题都容易解决，因为贫农并没有这些顾虑。
    贫农翻身后，获得基本的生产条件，迫切要求发家，生产情绪最高，但是他们仍有困难，缺乏牲畜及农具，这时组织互助，就成为和“生产发家”同等重要的要求。贫农参加了互助以后，只要解决了计工换工等技术问题，就会想方设法的把互助搞好，正是这种要求的反映。
    农村过去就有一种互助的习惯，几户贫农或贫农与中农结合起来，贫农用中农的牲口，中农用贫农的劳力，虽无精确计工，却也长期不散，看起来似乎非常自愿与等价，其实不然，那时候贫农没有牲口，又没有组织，离了中农不办事，借中农牲口用具，要在农事最忙如麦收、下种、锄苗的时候，给中农还工，这种时候劳力最贵，实际上还是不等价。现在互助起来，自己不再被别人占便宜，就很满意了，因此，并无吃亏的感觉。
    互助起来集体劳动，一反农民个体劳动的习惯，表现出来就是没有个体劳动“自由”，但是贫农并不会产生“不自由”的感觉。过去他们借别人的牲口，是以承人家的鼻息，人家愿意什么时候借给，就什么时候借给，自己还工却要在别人最忙（也是劳力最值钱）的时候，自己的一切被旁人决定，正是最不自由的。现在参加了互助，和大家商量商量，该作啥作啥，感觉得比过去反倒自由多了。
    贫农过去最受压迫，尝遍了人世沧桑的味道，被旁人在“马马虎虎”的方式下占的便宜太多了，今天参加了互助，表现在等价问题就非常认真，“先明后不亏”的原则，主要是贫农提出来的（个别贫农觉悟较差，想占别人一些小便宜，只是极少数的现象）。贫农在互助组中，并不特别注意面子上的“涵厚”，而提倡“有一说一”这正是巩固互助的一个重要关键。
    上面许多情况，都说明贫农最依靠互助，最愿意互助，懂得互助对自己有百利无一害。贫农翻身后，又有了地位，如果当了互助组长或队长，更会十分珍重自己艰苦斗争得来的利益和现状，设法不使它丧失或损坏了。邱县在灾荒最严重时，政府领导农民运输救荒，运输队中有一千零五十五户贫农，完全成为今天邱区互助运动的骨干和基础，有三十五个富农饿得参加了当时的互助运输，后来年景稍好，大部分都退出，这个历史事实有力说明互助生产没有贫农领导是绝对无法搞好的。
    中农最初并没有参加互助的迫切要求，他的家庭是一个比较完整的生产单位，虽然过去在劳力最忙时也要贫农帮忙，但是他有牲口，常常属于主动与占便宜的地位。上面说的三种顾虑，主要是中农的思想，他们不愿意丧失过去那种不应有的便宜和地位。土地改革前，领导上提倡互助，李省庄的中农也响应了，他们比贫农最有利的条件是有牲口，怕吃了亏，因此提出牛不入到互助组中，有的自己有牛单找其他有牛户互助，在割麦时真正感到光有牛没有劳力不解决问题，麦收后主动的要求和贫农互助，形成了麦后互助大变工，中农这个阶层很敏感，吃亏占便宜很快会感觉出来，迅速改变自己的行动。
    土地改革后，出现了一种新情况，贫农有了土地，也分得一部农具牲畜及浮财，最困难的是牲畜农具不足用，用合资伙买的方法可解决一部分困难，用互助起来伙买农具及人拉犁的方法又解决了一部分困难，不靠中农自己也勉强可以耕地了。中农增加了新的困难，因贫农都有了相当的土地自己刚够种了，打短工的空前减少，他们在人力最缺乏时常常有钱觅不到人。李省庄有一户中农，参加了互助，他看到其他五户贫农还未参加，自己还想用过去那种方法讨便宜，宣布退出互助组，后来那五户贫农都参加了互助，占便宜的对象完全丧失，自己只得重新参加，大寨有一户中农，在互助组中净想占便宜，非常“尖头”，贫农们又劝不改，暂时开除了来教育他，那时正盖房，贫农分了材料，互助出工不花什么钱，把房盖好，这位中农只得雇人盖房，三间花了二十四万，他这时大为懊悔，向贫农表示一定要转变，希望重新让他入组。
    中农除了上面那些不得不参加互助的客观原因以外，还有一个原因，即在土地改革后，他们对斗争有了错觉（均产）怕斗争，不愿放手生产发家，因为贫农在村里发言权最大，于是又愿意和贫农靠拢，以示自己和他们一家，这是一种好现象，只有中农依靠贫农，才能得到贫农的帮助与改造。但是检查中农这时参加互助的动机，多少还有些压迫情绪，许多事实说明，这并不可怕，他只要在互助中得到了好处，这种被迫情绪很快就转变了。
    许多材料说明，互助不由贫农领导绝对搞不好。中农在农村的比重极大，又得好好团结与教育他们，最好的方法是在开展大互助运动中，有意识的培养若干以贫农为领导骨干的小组，帮助搞好典型示范，以教育与影响中农，互助运动即可稳步开展。
