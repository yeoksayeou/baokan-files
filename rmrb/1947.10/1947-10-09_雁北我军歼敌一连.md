　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 7th. The Third Battalion of the First Regiment of the Thirty-eighth Division of Yan’s army, entrenched in Huai Ren county, transported twenty carts to Goose Feather Pass, fifteen miles west of the city, on September 20th, to seize coal (note: this area is one of the mining areas in the Jin Sui Border Region). The people's armed forces immediately rushed to cut off their retreat and launched a strong attack, rushing into the village for street fighting. Two enemy companies fled in panic up the mountains, and another company was completely defeated. More than thirty enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and thirty-nine were captured alive. The masses near and far were overjoyed and came to comfort the army.
