　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. According to a Tianjin Dagongbao report on the 1st, the US military in Tianjin "transferred" a large amount of military supplies, including arms and vehicles, to the Kuomintang army for use in August. The US military authorities in Tianjin, fearing that this despicable act of assisting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army in slaughtering the Chinese people would arouse the anger of the Chinese people, falsely claimed that the arms had been "completely destroyed by fire." The US invading army in China has repeatedly engaged in the despicable act of directly supplying Chiang Kai-shek bandits with aid for the civil war through this "transfer" of military supplies. In April of this year, the US military "transferred" the entire Xinhe armory near Tanggu to the Chiang Kai-shek army. The armory was extremely large, and it was said that the arms in the arsenal could supply six divisions of troops for eight months. The US military authorities also concealed this fact, but it was revealed by American correspondents stationed in China.

　　天津美军接济军火助长蒋匪屠杀人民
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据天津大公报一日消息，天津美军八月间曾将大量军用品，包括军火、汽车等“移交”国民党军队使用。天津美军当局惧怕此种援助蒋匪军队屠杀中国人民的卑劣行为，会引起中国人民的愤怒，曾伪称此项军火已予“悉数焚毁”。美国驻华侵略军以此种军火“移交”方式直接接济蒋匪内战的行为，已屡见不鲜，今年四月间美军即将塘沽附近新河军火库全部“移交”蒋匪军队，该军火库规模极大，据称库中军火可供六个师的军队打八个月之用。此项事实，美军当局亦曾予以隐瞒，但为美国驻华记者所揭露。
