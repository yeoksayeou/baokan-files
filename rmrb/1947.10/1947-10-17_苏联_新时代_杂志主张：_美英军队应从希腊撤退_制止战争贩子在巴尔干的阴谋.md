　　Soviet "New Times" Magazine Argues:
　　US and British Troops Should Withdraw from Greece
　　Stop War-Mongers' Conspiracies in the Balkans
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th] Moscow Dispatch: "New Times" magazine recently published an editorial exposing the conspiracies of US and British imperialism regarding the Greek problem, stating: In the eyes of the rulers in Washington and London, Greece is not a nation of the Greek people, but merely a military base. Greece's misfortune is due to its location at the intersection of strategic routes from the Mediterranean to the Balkans and the Middle East. War instigators place particular hope on the Greek problem. For example, during the war, Churchill would use the excuse of opening a second front to advocate armed intervention in Greece, attempting to suppress the freedom of the Balkan nations and establish an "anti-Soviet cordon" along the Balkans. Although this plan was shattered long ago, its decaying remnants have been a recurring theme in international affairs for more than two years. This is the true situation of the so-called "Greek border dispute." We demand that the United Nations speak justly on the Greek problem, namely that, in order to safeguard peace in Greece and tranquility in the Balkans, foreign troops should withdraw from Greece, and foreign interference in Greece and the war instigators' conspiracies in the Balkans should be stopped.

　　苏联“新时代”杂志主张：
  　美英军队应从希腊撤退
    制止战争贩子在巴尔干的阴谋
    【新华社陕北十三日电】莫斯科讯：“新时代”杂志顷发表社论，揭发美英帝国主义对于希腊问题背景之阴谋称：希腊在华盛顿与伦敦的统治者们看来，并不是希腊人民的国家，只是军事基地。希腊的不幸，就是由于它处在地中海至巴尔干与中东的战略通路的交点上。战争挑拨者们特别把希望寄托在希腊问题上，例如在战时邱吉尔即会借口开辟第二战场而主张武装干涉希腊，企图借此镇压巴尔干各民族之自由，并沿巴尔干建立一个“反苏警戒线”。该计划虽早被粉碎了，但两年多来它的腐朽残骸却还是国际上回响着的一支歌曲。这就是所谓“希腊边境纠纷事件”的真实情况。我们要求联合国应对希腊问题说一句公道话，即为了保障希腊的和平和巴尔干的安宁，外国军队应从希腊撤退，外国对希腊的干涉和战争挑拨者在巴尔干的阴谋，应予制止。
