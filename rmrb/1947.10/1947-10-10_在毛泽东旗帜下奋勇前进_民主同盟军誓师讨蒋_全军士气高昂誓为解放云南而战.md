　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th—The Democratic Allied Army, formed by General Pan Shuoduan's troops after the Haicheng Uprising last year, has joined the current autumn offensive and is fighting alongside the Democratic Allied Forces. On the 19th of last month, all officers and soldiers of the unit held a solemn and grand rally in a certain area to denounce Chiang Kai-shek. Zhang Chong, a famous general from Yunnan and former commander of the 184th Division, Mr. Xiao Zecang, a revolutionary elder from Yunnan, as well as representatives from local county and district governments and mass organizations, attended the meeting and spoke. Before the meeting, commanders and fighters enthusiastically presented pledges to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service, displaying extremely high morale. At the meeting, Director Xu (Wenlie) of the Political Department first explained the significance of the rally, followed by Commander Pan leading all officers and soldiers in raising their hands to take an oath, reciting the oath. General Zhang Chong addressed his old subordinates amidst thunderous applause. After enumerating Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of betraying the country and dictatorial rule, General Zhang said: "I have come to the liberated area in response to Chairman Mao's call and the uprising of the 184th Division. From now on, I will fight to the end under the banner of Mao Zedong for the complete liberation of the people of Yunnan and the people of the whole country." Mr. Xiao Zecang congratulated them, saying: "It is justified, reasonable, and confident of success to send troops to denounce Chiang." Representatives from the General Political Department of the Democratic Allied Forces, the government, and people's organizations also sent messages to all officers and soldiers, urging them to "bravely kill the enemy and perform meritorious service for the people." Commander Pan, Deputy Commander Zheng, Division Commander Wei, and others also spoke successively. They exhorted the officers and soldiers: "After a year of democratic education in the liberated area, we are now an army of the people. We must turn our oath into action and be determined to overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang!" Finally, soldiers' representatives Yu Jincai, Miao Guozhen, and others delivered speeches, recounting the various oppressions and sufferings they had endured under the rule of the Chiang bandits in the past, and expressing their determination to take revenge today, all with tears in their eyes. When Gao Jiafu spoke about how he was drafted into the army in 1943 by the village chief, tied up with ropes like a pig, and brutally beaten, he was so grieved that he sobbed. Once, he and a man surnamed Lu deserted together because they could not bear the abuse and beatings. After being caught, he was given fifty military strokes, leaving him covered in scars, while Lu had his ears cut off. Finally, he said: "Today we can enjoy officer-soldier equality, and we have the opportunity to avenge ourselves and perform meritorious service for the people by killing the enemy. We must thank Commander Pan for holding high the banner of justice. I represent all the soldiers in paying tribute to Commander Pan. This time, we are all determined to fight to Yunnan! Down with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" The entire army also unanimously passed a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all compatriots nationwide, vowing to denounce Chiang.
