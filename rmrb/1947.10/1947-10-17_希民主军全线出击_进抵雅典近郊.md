Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Athens Dispatch: The Greek Democratic Army has launched a full-scale offensive, with one route already threatening the Greek capital, Athens. According to TASS, citing Greek newspapers, General Las's forces of the Greek Democratic Army appeared for the first time in the southeastern suburbs of Athens on the 9th, and engaged in an encounter with government troops in the Menidi area, 15 kilometers north of Athens. In the northeast, units under the Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Command captured enemy fortresses in the Serres region. In the northwest, they inflicted heavy casualties on enemy forces near Florina, who were attacked by the Central and Western Macedonia Command.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Athens Dispatch: Stunned by the powerful offensive of the Greek Democratic Army, U.S. imperialism has decided to provide new "aid" to the reactionary Greek government in an attempt to save its precarious fate. According to the Yugoslav News Agency: Chief of Intelligence of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Cabell, and the current U.S. Ambassador to Greece, MacVeagh, recently consulted with Sophoulis, admitting that "Greece is not faring well in the war against the Democratic Army," and promised to give the reactionary Greek government greater "aid." At the same time, Cabell ordered the replacement of General Ventiris and others recommended by the British military delegation with American officers, in order to strengthen American control and supervision of the Greek Army Command.

　　希民主军全线出击
  　进抵雅典近郊
    【新华社陕北十四日电】雅典讯：希民主军全线出击，一路已威迫希京雅典。据塔斯社引希腊报纸消息：在东南部，希民主军拉斯将军所部，九日首次出现于雅典近郊，并在离雅典北十五公里的明尼提区与政府军发生遭遇战。在东北部，东马其顿与色雷斯指挥部所部攻克塞勒斯区敌人堡垒。在西北部对马其顿中部与西部指挥部所进击佛罗里那附近的敌军，缴获甚多。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】雅典讯：美帝国主义为希腊民主军强大攻势所震慑，现决予希反动政府以新“援助”，以挽救其垂危之命运。据南斯拉夫通讯社讯：美国参谋总部情报处长卡伯伦及美现驻希大使麦克维，日前曾与索福利斯会商，承认“希腊对民主军作战不利”，答应给希反动政府更大“援助”。同时卡伯伦命令将英军事代表团所推荐的温提里斯将军等撤换，而代之以美国军官，借以加强美国对希陆军指挥部的控制与监督。
