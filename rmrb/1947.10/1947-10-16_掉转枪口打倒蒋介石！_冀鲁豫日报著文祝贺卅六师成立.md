　　Turn the Guns Around and Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek!
  　The Jilu Yu Daily Publishes an Article Congratulating the Establishment of the 36th Division
    [Report from our Jilu Yu office on the 14th] The Jilu Yu Daily published an editorial entitled "Turn the Guns Around and Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek" to celebrate the establishment of the 36th Division of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army. The editorial pointed out: Just as the People's Liberation Army is beginning its nationwide counter-offensive, the establishment of the 36th Division of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, with the assistance of the military and civilians in the liberated areas after the Zhang regiment's uprising, is tantamount to a heavy blow to Chiang Kai-shek's heart, pointing out a bright path of self-help and survival for the troops in Chiang's bandit camp who still have righteousness and conscience. The editorial stated: The Northwest Army has a long history, and also had many military achievements during the Anti-Japanese War. However, like all other miscellaneous armies, it was driven like servants by Chiang's bandits and guarded against like enemies. After the start of the civil war, they were rushed to the front line to die, and Mr. Feng Yuxiang, the founder and leader of the Northwest Army, was expelled from the country. These tragic endings have made the patriotic Northwest Army officers and soldiers with a little foresight realize that if they do not resolutely break away from the shackles of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang and throw themselves into the embrace of the people, they will be buried together with Chiang's bandits without any value. Therefore, the only way out for patriotic Northwest Army soldiers is to quickly strike and revolt, stand with the people, and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek. The editorial said to the glorious uprising of the 356th Regiment military assistants and soldiers: "Your just action of turning your guns around to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek is a powerful call. Today, under the leadership of Division Commander Zhang Gonggan, you have established the 36th Division of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army and become glorious fighters of the People's Army. You should maintain and promote the tradition of the Northwest Army's hard work and endurance, establish the political work of the People's Army, and develop a heroic and tenacious fighting style; overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the common enemy who oppresses and enslaves us, and liberate all of China!

　　掉转枪口打倒蒋介石！
  　冀鲁豫日报著文祝贺卅六师成立
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】冀鲁豫日报特以“掉转枪口打倒蒋介石”为题发表社论，庆祝西北民主联军三十六师成立。该社论指出：正当人民解放军开始全国大反攻的时候，张团起义后在解放区军民协助下，建立西北民主联军三十六师，不啻给蒋介石的心脏痛打了一拳，为留在蒋匪阵营内尚有正义良知的部队指出了一条自救求生存的光明大道。社论称：西北军有着长远的历史，在抗日时期也曾有过不少战功。但是一如所有其他杂牌军一样，被蒋匪驱之如仆役，防备如仇寇。内战开始后又赶到第一线送死，西北军的创始人与领导者冯玉祥先生被逐出国。这些惨痛的下场，使稍有远见的爱国的西北军人，觉悟到不坚决摆脱蒋介石匪帮的枷锁投入人民怀抱，将毫无价值的和蒋匪一道被人民所埋葬。因此，爱国的西北军人，只有迅速罢战起义，和人民站在一起，打倒蒋介石才是出路。社论向光荣起义的三五六团军佐士兵们说：“你们掉转枪口打倒蒋介石的正义的行动，是一个有力的号召。你们今天在张公干师长领导下成立西北民主联军三十六师，成为人民军队的光荣战士，应当保持与发扬西北军人艰苦耐劳的传统，建立人民军队的政治工作，锻炼英勇顽强的战斗作风；打倒压迫奴役我们的共同敌人蒋家匪帮，解放全中国！
