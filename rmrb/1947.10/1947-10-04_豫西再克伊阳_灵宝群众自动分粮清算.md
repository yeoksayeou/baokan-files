　　Xinhua News Agency, Yu Xi Frontline, 2nd: Our troops on the eastern front re-liberated Yiyang County, south of Luoyang, on September 28th. They also captured Linru Town, belonging to Linru County, capturing over 50 enemy soldiers and seizing over 30 rifles. The remaining enemy fled east. Yiyang was previously liberated by us on September 12th and then invaded by Chiang Kai-shek's Third Division on the 15th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yu Xi Frontline, 2nd: After the liberation of Lingbao, thousands of people rose up to struggle against landlords and local bullies. On the 18th, our democratic government distributed 150 *shi* of relief grain, but because there were so many extremely poor people, it was not enough to distribute. After the masses understood our government's land reform policy, on the 20th, two thousand people automatically divided the grain of Su Yubao, a large landlord in Xiguan. They immediately organized Poor People's Turn-Over Associations and Poor People's Associations to settle accounts with the landlords. Poor peddlers, workers, refugees, and starving teachers in the urban area were all drawn into the struggle. On the 23rd, they settled accounts with the local bully and landlord Zhang Yongtang. Zhang's tenants and debtors numbered more than 500. More than 30 activists brought Zhang Yongtang, who had fled, back overnight for settlement. On the 25th, more than 300 members of the Xiguan Poor People's Association watched a performance of "Blood and Tears of Vengeance" by a certain unit's cultural troupe with tears in their eyes. That night, they settled accounts with Su Yutang, the largest landlord in Lingbao. The masses were indignant, complaining and reasoning until dawn. The landlords' grain, clothing, and houses were quickly distributed in both places, and turn-over committees and fruit disposal committees were democratically elected. They automatically took out guns to form fruit turn-over guard teams. The mood in the whole city became increasingly high. When Zhang Yongtang's grain was distributed in Nanguan on the 20th, the masses wore red silk ribbons of the Poor People's Turn-Over Association, joyous as if celebrating a festival. A city-wide joint struggle is currently brewing to further distribute the land.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yu Xi Frontline, 1st: Ten thousand people in Shan County gathered to celebrate the liberation. The conference was solemnly held on September 25th in Beiguan Square. The whole city was filled with gongs and drums, and everyone was overjoyed. Citizens carried dazzling flags and carried pigs, sheep, and other慰劳品 [comfort items] to participate. At the meeting, democratic county magistrate Han Luguang and the CCP representative announced the implementation of policies such as "land to the tiller" and the abolition of Chiang Kai-shek's exorbitant taxes and levies. The masses cheered and supported the policies, and their voices shook the four cities. Subsequently, five representatives of workers and peasants took the stage to speak, calling on the elders of Shan County to support the liberation army and settle accounts with landlords, local bullies, and *baojia* chiefs.
