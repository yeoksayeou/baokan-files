　　I went to the village office to assign meals,
　　The moment I saw the village chief, I said:
　　"We are not one family with the landlords,
　　You should pick a poor family,
　　And rotate one family each day."
　　The village chief laughed heartily upon hearing this,
　　He said: "Comrade, comrade,
　　You are a true Eighth Route Army soldier,
　　One family with us poor people."
　　
　　I went to Erdan's house,
　　The eaves were a head taller than me,
　　Five people, big and small, lived huddled together.
　　Erdan told me to sit down quickly!
　　He held the rice bowl up to my eyes,
　　Smiling at me as I drank,
　　I looked and something wasn't right,
　　I hurriedly said: "Eat quickly!
　　We are one family, no need to be polite!"
　　He just smiled, as if he didn't understand,
　　I said: "If you don't eat,
　　I won't drink either!"
　　He smiled so hard his beard flew open,
　　He picked up the rice and ate mouthful after mouthful,
　　I looked at him, wrinkles all over his head;
　　Like earthworms crawling one by one, (Note 1)
　　I looked at him, having suffered a lifetime of hardship,
　　So careful and timid he hardly spoke,
　　I asked: "Have you turned over well?"
　　He said: "I have!"
　　I pointed to the small house,
　　I said: "A big cabinet can't fit in here!"
　　He said: "Comrade, you can't say it that way,
　　I was given a mu of 'eye land'!" (Note 2)
　　I said: "What do the landlords live in?"
　　He said: "They live in tall buildings and mansions!"
　　I said: "Is one mu enough to eat and drink?"
　　He immediately put down his bowl,
　　He said: "Comrade, we still need to turn over!"

　　I went to the second house to eat,
　　I looked up: the building was tall and large,
　　I glanced inside: it was an empty shell, (Note 3)
　　A three-legged table leaned against the wall,
　　On the broken bamboo bed: a tattered quilt crawling with bedbugs,
　　I sat down on the small stool,
　　I didn't see a woman,
　　I picked up the rice bowl and asked,
　　I learned: his name was Zhang Xiaowa,
　　He was thirty-eight years old this year,
　　Had been a bachelor his whole life,
　　I asked: "Have you turned over completely?"
　　He said: "I have completely turned over!
　　Before the Eighth Route Army came, I had no home,
　　Exposed to wind and rain, fleeing to other places,
　　Without even a tile to cover myself,
　　Now, I have a house and land!"
　　I said: "You don't have a wife,
　　You can't put down roots!"
　　Upon hearing this, he got agitated,
　　Patted his chest and stamped his feet,
　　The bitter melon in his stomach blossomed,
　　Again and again he cursed the landlords,
　　I said: "Right! We still need to work hard!
　　There's a lot of furniture missing in the house!"
　　He said angrily: "I want to make a suggestion,
　　To thoroughly defeat the landlords!"

　　I went to the third house to eat,
　　His name was Shandan Hua,
　　He had been repairing shoes for thirty years,
　　Without accumulating a single coin.
　　Look at him: hee hee hee, ha ha ha,
　　His old whiskers flew nonstop,
　　He said: "The Eighth Route Army is really good,
　　Before, mentioning us was like using hemp thread to tie tofu,
　　Comrade, you see:
　　House, cabinet, table, chair, iron rake…
　　Were all given to us by the public.
　　My child is also growing up
　　I even got a small box,
　　He can also carry it to support shoes,
　　And can also earn money."

　　I, holding a bowl of corn porridge, said:
　　"Eating and drinking are still not good enough!"
　　He said: "I'm not afraid of the situation, (Note 4)
　　In the past, I would repair shoes for a day and eat for a day,
　　When it rained, my stomach would be empty,
　　Now, we can slowly make up for it!"
　　I asked: "What do the landlord's dogs eat?"
　　Upon hearing this, he jumped a foot high,
　　Almost dropping the rice bowl on the ground,
　　He said: "I want to report to the farmers' association,
　　The landlord's family is still eating white steamed buns!"

　　I assigned meals to three families in three days,
　　I discovered the problem,
　　Quickly convened a meeting of poor people,
　　Everyone talked about their situation!
　　"Shortage of houses, lack of land, no ploughs…"
　　Then go to visit the landlord's house,
　　See what they eat and wear?!
　　A raging fire has been ignited.

　　September 2, 1947, working in Daxinzhuang, Bo'ai.
　　(Note 1) "Earthworm" is earthworm,
　　(Note 2) "Eye land" is good land,
　　(Note 3) "Empty Gela" means there is nothing
　　(Note 4) "Not afraid" means good, "afraid" means bad, the above are all Henan dialect

　　我到穷人家吃饭
    叶枫
    一
    我进村公所去派饭，
    一见村长我说啦：
    “咱跟地主不一家，
    你要挑个穷人家，
    一天轮流派一家。”
    村长一听笑哈哈，
    他说：“同志，同志呀，
    你是真正八路军，
    跟咱穷人是一家。”
    二
    我进二旦家，
    房檐比我高一扎，
    大小五口搭着窝。
    二旦叫我快坐吧！
    饭碗端到眼皮下，
    他嘻嘻笑着看我喝，
    我一看，情况不对啦，
    急忙说：“快吃呀！
    一家人，客气啥！
    他光笑，象是没懂下，
    我说：“你不吃，
    咱也不喝啦！”
    他笑得胡须飞开啦，
    端起饭连口下，
    我看他，脑壳上绉纹纹；
    好比地龙一条一条爬，（注一）
    我看他，受了一辈苦，
    小心小胆不好说个话，
    我问啦：“翻好身吗？”
    他说：“翻好啦！”
    我指着一间小家家，
    我说：“一个大柜放不下！”
    他说：“同志不能这么说法，
    我分了一亩眼睛地啦！”（注二）
    我说：“地主们住的啥？”
    他说：“住的高楼大厦！”
    我说：“一亩地够吃喝？”
    他马上把碗来放下，
    他说：“同志，还得翻身呀！”
    我进第二家去吃饭，
    抬头一看：楼房高又大，
    进门一瞧：是个空圪拉，（注三）
    三条腿桌子靠墙放，
    破竹床上：窟窿被子臭虫爬，
    小板凳上我坐下，
    不见一位女人家，
    端起饭碗我问啦，
    才知道：他叫张小娃，
    今年三十八，
    打了一辈光棍啦，
    我问：“翻透身吗？”
    他说：“翻透啦！
    八路军没来我没家，
    风打雨淋逃他乡，
    没有一张盖身瓦，
    如今，有房有地啦！”
    我说：“你没老婆呀，
    不能将根来扎下！”
    这一说，他急啦，
    又拍胸来又蹬脚，
    肚内苦瓜开了花，
    声声来把地主骂，
    我说：“对！还得干呀！
    房里家具短得多！”
    他气呼呼说：“我要提意见，
    将地主斗个稀哩哗！”
    我到第三家去吃啦，
    他叫个闪旦华，
    掌鞋整整三十年，
    一文大钱没积下。
    你看他：嘻嘻嘻，哈哈哈，
    老腮胡飞得停不下，
    他说啦：“八路军真好呀，
    以前吧，麻丝拴豆腐不提他，
    同志你瞧吧：
    房、柜、桌、椅、铁钉耙……
    都是公家分给咱。
    我孩孩也长大
    我还要了个小箱箱，
    他也能担上去撑鞋，
    也能将钱来挣下。”
    我端着一碗圪星糊糊说开啦：
    “吃喝可还不中呀！”
    他说：“光景可不怕，（注四）
    往日撑一天鞋吃一天，
    天一下雨肚子搁起啦，
    如今，慢慢亏对吧！”
    我问：“地主家狗吃啥？”
    他一听，双脚蹦起高尺把，
    饭碗差点摔地下，
    他说：“我要到农会去报告，
    地主家还吃白馍呀！”
    三
    三天派了三个家，
    我把问题发现啦，
    赶快召集穷人开大会，
    大家都把光景拉！
    “短房，缺地，没犁耙……”
    再去参观地主家，
    看到人家吃穿啥？！
    冲天大火烧开啦。
     一九四七年九月二日于博爱大辛庄工作中。
    （注一）“地龙”即蚯蚓，
    （注二）“眼睛地”是好地，
    （注三）“空圪拉”意思是啥也没有
    （注四）“不怕”是好的意思，“怕”就是不好，以上都是豫北土话
