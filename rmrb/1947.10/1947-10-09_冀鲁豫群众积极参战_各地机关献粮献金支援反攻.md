[Report from our newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 7th] To support the great counter-offensive, the masses in various regions are actively joining the war, and local organs are donating grain and money. In the Daogou and Xulou areas of the fourth district of Kunshan, our army resisted Chiang's Fifth Army, persisting for two days and nights. Under the barrage of bullets and the bombing of nine aircraft, the Daogou village cadres and the villagers, both men and women, did not run away while supplying the front lines. The men assisted the army in digging fortifications, and the women cooked and ground wheat at home. Only after our army completed its blocking mission did the entire village, under the cover of our troops, jointly relocate. When our main force was stationed in Kunshan County, villages along the river organized teams to lead the way, small donkey teams, and porter teams, each responsible for various logistical support tasks. All the mills and livestock in the villages were put into intensive use. Because a large portion of their livestock had been taken away by Chiang's army, many villages used manpower to grind flour, but no village complained. Tan Nali XX pulled up forty-odd catties of unripe radishes from his garden and sent them to the troops to eat, saying, "Although it is a pity to pull them up, I feel comfortable giving them to our troops." He carried the flour to the troops through muddy water in the rainy weather, and his back was chafed with blisters, but he did not complain of hardship. At a village cadre meeting in the second district of Puyang, upon hearing that there would be a major battle in Henan, the village cadres competed to take stretchers to participate in the war and set out competition conditions: (1) Guarantee to cross the river to complete the task. (2) Maintain good mass discipline. The stretcher team from the fifth district of Kaocheng carried wounded soldiers from the Wangqiao battle. On a dark and rainy night, with enemy gunfire to the south, they crossed two rivers in one night, providing boiled water to the wounded along the way while drinking cold water themselves. At dawn, they washed the wounded soldiers' bloody clothes and took care of their every need, being very attentive. The stretcher team from the Shangqu district of Junan County not only successfully completed their tasks but also launched a "people love the people" campaign in the villages where they were stationed, helping the masses with the autumn harvest. Upon returning in the evening, they helped their landlords fetch water and chop grass. On rainy days when there was no dry firewood, the landlords even broke apart their broken baskets for the stretcher team to burn, and the relationship between the two sides was very good. In addition, people in various places enthusiastically saved money and grain to donate. Ninety-one veterans with disabilities in Gaoling County said, "Because we are disabled, we cannot go to the front lines to eliminate old Chiang ourselves. We will only donate the supply grain we should receive to increase the strength to destroy Chiang." Some donated all their supply grain until the end of the year, and some donated most of it, totaling 4,592 catties of rice. Li Qinglian and fourteen other veterans with disabilities in Dong'a County donated a total of 1,680 catties of wheat, 5,640 catties of rice, and 6,405 catties of firewood. All the staff of Taiyun Bookstore not only donated their rationed rice from August to the end of the year, but also many comrades donated most of their savings over the years. The entire store of 132 people donated a total of 295,600 yuan and 6,342 catties of rice. The cadres and miscellaneous personnel of the Third Prefectural Committee donated 8,000 yuan, 23 pairs of shoes, 4 towels, and 600 catties of rationed rice, resolving to spend as little pocket money as possible until old Chiang is defeated. Sun Yuntang and 26 others from the Transportation Section donated a total of 47,400 yuan, as well as 5 sets of military uniforms and 2 pairs of socks. The Shanxian County Committee donated 15 pairs of shoes, 330 catties of rationed wheat, 2.6 zhang of cloth, and 21,640 yuan. The Shanxian County Government donated 4,045 catties of millet, 93,155 yuan, 203 catties of wheat, and 693 catties of firewood. Fengxian first economized from public funds, not wasting a single cent, and the comrades also collectively quit smoking. Junan donated shoes, cloth, etc., worth approximately 76,225 yuan. The organs of Kunwu County donated a total of 27,445 catties of rice, 18,433 catties of wheat, 500 catties of beans, 48,570 catties of firewood, and 5,327,250 yuan, as well as one large cart and one rickshaw each.
