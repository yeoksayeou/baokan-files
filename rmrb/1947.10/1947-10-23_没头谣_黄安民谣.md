Title: Headless Rhyme - Huang'an Folk Song

Headless rhymes are also known as wooden rhymes. The term "headless" implies being made up on the spot, without beginning or end. During the Anti-Japanese War, the folk songs of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui region often vehemently criticized the Kuomintang's anti-communist armies, such as: "Anti-Communist guerrillas, eat and sleep, retreat when the Japanese come, not daring to look back." The following headless rhyme also speaks of such a reactionary county magistrate. The people, through practical experience, saw the problem so deeply, spoke so clearly, and held such great hatred. The people are the best witnesses and creditors. Now that our army has returned to Huang'an, it is time for a complete reckoning of all old and new blood debts. Therefore, this folk song still seems fresh and has new meaning.

　　　　　　　
　
　　　　　　(I)
　
    Jiang Rongping, in Huang'an,
    Became county magistrate in Qiliping. (Note 1)
    His subordinates, layer upon layer, (Note 2)
    The sky is three feet three inches high.
    Killing and arson,
    Scraping the land bare.
    The people deserve to die,
    The magistrate gets promoted.
    A hundred or so lives,
    Not worth his meal.
　
    It's hard to say when you bring it up...
    Dozens of villages, (Note 3)
    Suddenly turned green:
    A fire started,
    Burning until nothing is left. (Note 4)
    What is a "bandit area"?
    After all, it's still China;
    What is a "bandit area"?
    Only heaven knows!
    Reporting the suppression of "bandits,"
    Inside are only ghosts,
    Tied to the execution ground,
    People's lives are worth less than water!
    -- Anti-communist, anti-people,
    Where is there any justice!

(Note 1) At that time, Jiang Rongping only occupied a corner of Qiliping. Most of Huang'an was a liberated area. These words have a satirical meaning.
(Note 2) His subordinates were only village chiefs, so they were called subordinates layer upon layer.
(Note 3) Wanzi means villages.
(Note 4) Moro means what.
　
　　　　　　(II)
　
    A group of businessmen
    Passed by Qiliping
    Met with robbery head-on,
    Wanted to sue in the yamen (government office).
    The magistrate said:
    "Listen carefully, youngsters,
    It must be 'communist bandits'
    Calling you to inquire,
    Ruining my official reputation, is it not!
    Where is your arrival from?
    Where is your proof?
    If you don't show it (Note 1)
    I will take your life!
    Get out, get out,
    Don't wait for me to get angry!"
    Poor common people,
    Dried up and squatting hard, (Note 2)
    The "black rod" standing in front,
    Is the "iron" "evidence!" (Note 3)
    If you say it out,
    Do you want your life or not!
    Fleeing with their heads in their hands,
    Advising each other along the way:
    "Bad luck, disband the business,
    Met with the 'Ghost Festival'?" (Note 4)

(Note 1) That is, take it out.
(Note 2) Meaning, squatting there rigidly, describing helplessness.
(Note 3) The robbery was actually organized by the county magistrate, hence this statement.
(Note 4) Bad luck means unlucky, disband the business means break up the partnership, the Ghost Festival is a common name for the Ghost Festival, meaning encountering a ghost.
　
　　　　　　(III)
　
    The county magistrate patrolled Ercheng Township,
    The people there suffered,
    An order was given to the village captain:
    "To show power, we must do 'Three Alls'!" (Note 1)
    The headquarters lived in the township office,
    Asking all day, "Why?"
    "The superior is a 'bandit area',
    Why not set it on fire?
    Take some teams there,
    Guarantee it will be perfectly done." (Note 2)
    Captain Hu Chengyi,
    Really had ruthlessness;
    Township Chief Wu Guoyi,
    After all, had power.
    The two "Yis" led the team,
    Making "achievements" all the way,
    The people didn't know what was happening,
    Boxes and cabinets turned upside down,
    Valuable things,
    Flying into their pockets.
　
    Grandly,
    With necks high and heads up,
    Displaying power and might,
    Who dared to look?
    Arriving at Shangdian,
    Setting off the fuse,
    A peaceful situation,
    Suddenly changed.
    The village captain on patrol,
    The people were doomed! (Note 3)
    Afraid of not burning cleanly,
    Sending some old bosses to watch.
    A small child in a thatched house, (Note 4)
    Burned and cried like a toad,
    Adults were caught,
    No one to bail them out again,
    Turned to ash and scattered,
    Becoming two wandering ghosts.
    Walls collapsed,
    The old bosses laughed!
    "Setting fires in three places,
    Isn't it awesome?"
    Alas!
    The officials appointed by the National Government,
    Who dared to complain?!
　
    Catching the common people,
    Taking them to Qiliping,
    Opening court to judge:
    "'Communist bandits' can't live!"
    Secretly sending a message:
    "Sending money is okay."
    Wanting someone to speak for you,
    First take the money to stuff,
    Even selling wives and children,
    Who dares to say "no"!
    Once the matter is settled,
    The money is not guilty. (Note 5)
    The more than ten thousand,
    Go back to sell and buy rice for the pot.
    Poor paupers,
    You should pay with your life.
    Blame only your parents,
    For being so poor.

(Note 1) Rob all, kill all, burn all.
(Note 2) Shangguan, a place name, is a liberated area; how means how; team means team.
(Note 3) Meaning unlucky.
(Note 4) Xiaoya means child.
(Note 5) Give money means pay money.

　　没头谣
  　黄安民谣
    燎荧辑
    没头谣又名木头谣。所谓没头，有信口编来没头没尾之意。抗日时期的鄂豫皖民谣，经常有痛骂国民党反共军的，例如：“反共游击队，吃了饭就睡，日本来了往后退，头也不敢回。”下面这首没头谣，也是讲的这样的一个反动县长，人民在实际体验中把问题看得多么深刻，讲得多么清楚，仇恨又多么大。人民是最好的证人，又是债主，现在我军已经回到了黄安，正是总清算一切新旧血债的时候。所以，这首民谣，看来还是新鲜的，而且还有新的意义。
    　　　　　　　
　
　　　　　　（一）
　
    蒋荣平，在黄安，
    七里坪，做县官。（注一）
    手下一层一，（二）
    天高三尺三。
    杀人又放火，
    刮得地皮穿。
    百姓该死，
    老爷加官。
    百十条性命，
    值不上他吃一餐。
　
    提起来，难得说……
    几十个湾子，（三）
    陡然变成青一色：
    一把火点去，
    烧得么罗都没得（四）
    甚么是“匪区”？
    毕竟同中国；
    甚么是“匪区”？
    除非天晓得！
    呈报剿了“匪”，
    里面光是鬼，
    绑得法场去，
    民命不如水！
    ——反共反人民，
    那里讲原委！
    （一）当时蒋荣平只占了七里坪一隅之地，黄安绝大部分都是解放区，这几句话，有讽刺之意。
    （二）他手下只是乡长，所以叫做手下一层一。
    （三）湾子，就是村庄。
    （四）么罗，甚么的意思。
　
　　　　　　（二）
　
    一群生意人
    路过七里坪
    当头碰到打劫，
    想进衙门诉冤情。
    县官把话论：
    “小辈且听真，
    一定是‘奸匪’
    叫你来探信，
    败坏俺官家名誉了不成！
    那是你的到来，
    那是你的证？
    如果还不座位出（一）
    就要你命归阴！
    滚罢，滚罢，
    莫待老子发牛性！”
    可怜小百姓，
    干巴和硬蹲，（二）
    面前站的“黑杆子”，
    便是个“铁”“证”！（三）
    若是说出来，
    要命不要命！
    抱着头鼠窜，
    一路苦相劝：
    “背了时散摊，
    遇着‘七月半’”？（四）
    （一）即拿出。
    （二）意约干巴巴的在那里硬蹲着，形容无奈。
    （三）打劫实际是县官组织的所以有这段说法。
    （四）背时即运气不好，散摊即散伙，七月半俗称鬼过年，意即撞了鬼了。
　
　　　　　　（三）
　
    县官出巡二程乡，
    那方百姓便遭殃，
    手令下给乡队长：
    “扬威就要做‘三光’。”（一）
    行辕住在乡公所，
    整天盘问“为什么？”
    “上官是‘匪区’，
    么样不点一把火？
    带些队子去，
    包管千万妥。”（二）
    队长胡承义，
    实在有狠气；
    乡长吴国义，
    毕竟有权力。
    两“义”带队走，
    一路做“成绩”，
    百姓不知何事起，
    箱子柜子翻倒底，
    值钱的东西，
    飞上腰包里。
　
    浩浩荡荡，
    颈高头仰，
    耀武扬威，
    那个敢望？
    到了上店，
    放下火线，
    承平局面，
    突然转变。
    乡队长放哨，
    百姓该倒灶！（三）
    怕烧不干净，
    派些老总照。
    茅屋一小伢，（四）
    烧做虾蟆叫，
    大人被捉了，
    再没有人捞，
    化骨又扬灰，
    变做两头鬼。
    墙倒壁又塌，
    老总们好笑！
    “三处点着火，
    你看奥不奥？”
    唉！
    国民政府放的官，
    那个顾命的敢告？！
　
    捉了老百姓，
    带上七里坪，
    开了法堂审：
    “‘奸匪’活不成！”
    暗地又传信：
    “送钱不要紧。”
    要托人去说，
    先拿钱来塞，
    纵卖婆娘伢，
    谁敢说“没得”！
    事情下了地，
    把钱没得罪。（五）
    多的十万几，
    回去赶粜下锅米。
    可怜穷光蛋，
    该你拿命抵。
    怨只怨爹娘，
    不该贫如洗。
    （一）抢光、杀光、烧光。
    （二）上官，地名，是解放区；么样即怎样；队子就是队伍。
    （三）倒霉的意思。
    （四）小伢即小孩子。
    （五）把钱即给钱。
