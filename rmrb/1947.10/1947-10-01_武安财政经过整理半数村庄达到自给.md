[This report from our newspaper's correspondent] in Taihang, 29th: After half a year of mass financial reorganization in Wu'an County, more than 50% of the villages have achieved self-sufficiency in production. In addition, public property worth 15,608,400 yuan was sold at auction and reinvested in production. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the county's village financial expenditures can be completely resolved. The county has a total of 382 administrative villages. After preliminary reorganization, 192 villages have achieved self-sufficiency, 106 villages are semi-self-sufficient, and 84 villages have not been reorganized. According to social burdens and all village expenditures before the reorganization, the county needed 700 million yuan. After the reorganization, expenditures can be reduced by 500 million yuan. If the assets from the reorganization are reinvested in production, with each yuan generating one yuan in profit annually, all village expenditures can be self-sufficient. After the reorganization, village financial management committees have been universally established through democratic discussions to further develop production plans and formulate budgets and final accounts. More scientific organizations have been developed for material operation and management. For example, in Baiguan Village in the ninth district, more than 500,000 yuan was raised by selling public property and reinvested in production. A management committee was established, with production, storage, and auditing groups responsible for approving expenditures and publishing accounts. In Diantou Village in the eighth district, where there was a lack of animal power, two donkeys were purchased to facilitate transportation, which not only solved the village's expenses but also solved the difficulties in mass production.

　　武安财政经过整理半数村庄达到自给
    【本报太行二十九日电】武安财政经过半年来群众性的整理，已有百分之五十以上村庄达到生产自给，如加上整理出的公产拍卖洋一万万五千六百零八万四千元，投入再生产，预计年终则可解决全县村财政的开支。该县共有三百八十二个行政村，经过初步整理走上自给的一百九十二个村，半自给的一百零六个村，没整理的八十四个村。据未整理前的社会负担及一切村款开支，全县需款七万万元，经过整顿后，可缩减开支五万万元，如再将整理出的资财，投入再生产，每年每元以营利一元计，全部村款开支即可自给。各村整理后，经过民主讨论，均普遍组织了村财政管理委员会，进一步订出生产计划，并制定预决算。对物资经营与管理，已产生了较为科学的组织，如九区百官村，把整理出来的公产，拍卖洋五十余万元，投入生产，并成立了管理委员会，下设生产、保管、审计等组，专管批核开支，公布帐目；八区店头村，畜力缺乏，即买了两头驴，运输方便，这样既解决了村上开支，又解决了群众生产中的困难。
