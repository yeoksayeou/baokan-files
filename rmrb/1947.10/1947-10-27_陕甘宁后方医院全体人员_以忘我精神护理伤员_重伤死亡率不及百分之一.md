Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th—Under the slogan of "Taking good care of one wounded soldier is equal to killing ten enemies," the entire staff of the border region's rear hospitals serves the wounded with a selfless spirit. The First Rear Hospital established a blood transfusion team consisting of more than 60 doctors, nurses, and administrative staff, and has transfused 5,170 cc of blood, enabling severely wounded soldiers on the verge of death to be rescued in time. In the past six months, the number of wounded who have been cured and discharged or transferred to convalescence accounted for 75.4 percent of the total number of wounded admitted to the hospital. The mortality rate of severely wounded has been reduced from 2.5 percent to less than 1 percent. Zhou Zezhi, the director of medical affairs, adopted treatment methods such as timely surgery, appropriate fixation, sterile dressing, and plaster cast immobilization, which used fewer medicines and fewer dressing changes, so that the wounded with soft tissue penetrating gunshot wounds that did not injure bones and muscles could be completely healed after a maximum of three weeks of treatment and one bandage change. He also performed delicate nerve exposure and anastomosis surgery, so that wounded soldiers with nerve damage would not become disabled. Doctors Zhang Yu and Wang Ying, through dedicated research, used injection of magnesium sulfate, glucose saline, and other treatments to cure patients with corrosive infections and tetanus, which were the most difficult for the medical community to handle. Zhang Zhijie, a head nurse in one ward, worked up to 18 hours a day. Nurse Wu Yonghou voluntarily took on three weeks of night shifts. Li Chunrui, the head nurse in the third ward, donated all the nutrition fees and eggs received after blood transfusions to the wounded. With the round-the-clock treatment by medical personnel, the wounded from the Yulin-Mizhi battle all recovered and were discharged to the front line in less than a month. Upon parting, they unanimously expressed that they would vow to kill the enemy and make meritorious deeds to thank the medical staff for their work enthusiasm. After recovering from his injuries, Liberation fighter Li Changjin traveled more than a hundred miles to return to his unit. He told people: "The soldiers on the other side (referring to the KMT army) want to run home as soon as they get their discharge certificate, while on this side (referring to the People's Liberation Army), they are eager to return to the front line to fight Hu Zongnan as soon as they are almost healed."
