　　[This report from the Jiluyu area on the 30th by our newspaper] Our reporter visited Regiment Commander Zhang Gonggan of the 356th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division of the Chiang army, who revolted against the civil war, in a certain area of the military region. Regiment Commander Zhang is from Su County, Anhui, and is 40 years old. He was a student at the Fenyang Military Academy and served as an adjutant to Mr. Feng Yuxiang for many years. When Regiment Commander Zhang spoke about the process of this anti-civil war uprising, he said: "After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the entire Chinese people hoped for the realization of a peaceful, democratic, and new China. Chiang Kai-shek, for the interests of a minority, continued to adhere to his traitorous and dictatorial rule, openly launched a civil war, tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and became the enemy of the entire Chinese people. After the start of the civil war, all the miscellaneous troops were transferred to the front line to serve as cannon fodder for the civil war, in order to eliminate dissidents. The original organization of this regiment belonged to the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division (Brigade Commander was Liu Guangxin). During the Juan’nan Campaign last year, the 119th Brigade was annihilated, and Brigade Commander Liu Guangxin was also captured. Only one or two hundred remnants returned. Later, the garrison personnel were used as the foundation, and after eight or nine months of reorganization and training, they were forced to go north again in late July this year to participate in the battle, and were transferred to the front line of Juancheng, once again forced to serve as cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek’s civil war. Chiang Kai-shek’s vicious methods are extremely hateful. We had long been determined to launch an anti-civil war uprising, so on September 13, we resolutely launched an uprising in Juancheng. After resolving all of Chiang's 'Homecoming Legions,' 'County Government,' and 'Security Teams,' we entered the liberated area north of the Yellow River with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army."

　　Regiment Commander Zhang also painfully recounted the situation of the Northwest Army being eliminated and disbanded by Chiang Kai-shek, saying: "During the Anti-Japanese War, the 68th Army originally had three divisions, the 113th, 119th, and 36th, totaling nine regiments. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was reduced to two divisions, and the designation of the 36th Division was abolished. The Second Army was again reduced to two brigades (four regiments) of the 66th Division; the 69th Army, which originally had two divisions and six regiments, was reorganized into one brigade and two regiments; the 12th Army, which had three divisions in the past (20th, 22nd, and 81st Divisions), is now only reorganized into two regiments of the 81st Brigade. The Second War Area, Feng Zhian's troops, originally had six divisions, the 37th, 38th, and 132nd, etc., with three regiments in each division. Now only two divisions and four brigades are left. In the Battle of Fei County, they served as cannon fodder for the Chiang army again. The 38th Division was completely annihilated, and Division Commander Zhai Zasan was killed in battle. The 37th Division was almost completely wiped out. The 55th Army, Cao Fulin's troops, were completely annihilated in the Yuncheng Campaign, and Cao Fulin barely escaped with his life. The 30th Army, which originally had three divisions, was reduced to two brigades, one brigade was annihilated, and the other brigade was surrounded in Linfen, Shanxi. These are all ironclad proof of Chiang Kai-shek's elimination of dissidents and utilization of miscellaneous troops. But no matter how desperately Chiang Kai-shek struggles, his inevitable fate of failure cannot be reversed. Within the Chiang army, from senior officers to soldiers, everyone is afraid of fighting, and corruption has reached its extreme. A company commander can embezzle more than two million Chiang currency a month, and a regimental commander can make forty to fifty million yuan a month, which is not even considered corruption. The entire war machine of the Chiang army has undergone fundamental changes. Most of its troops have lost their combat effectiveness." Regiment Commander Zhang continued to talk about his impressions of the liberated areas, saying: "What I saw in the Chiang-controlled areas was corruption, darkness, extreme suffering of the people, and rural decline. After arriving in the liberated areas, I saw the countryside full of vigorous new vitality, well-organized, the people's culture improved, abundant food and clothing, and gambling, prostitution, and beggars completely disappeared. This is the best example of building a new China. Wherever we went, men, women, old and young welcomed and comforted us. When passing through villages, the people treated us like their own brothers and sisters. We felt infinitely excited and greatly encouraged. We must follow the People's Liberation Army and all peace-loving and democratic people in the country, rise up together, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule of betraying the country and flattering foreign powers, and establish a peaceful and democratic new China!"

　　蒋贼排除异己驱作卖国工具
  　原西北军消灭殆尽
  　鄄城起义张团长痛斥蒋介石
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】记者于军区某地访问蒋军反内战起义的六十八师一一九旅三五六团张公干团长。张团长安徽宿县人，现年四十岁，汾阳军校学生，曾随冯玉祥先生作副官长多年。张团长谈到此次反内战起义的经过时称：“抗战胜利后，全中国人民都希望和平民主新中国的实现，蒋介石为少数人的利益，继续坚持其卖国独裁统治，公然发动内战，撕毁政协决议，与全中国人民为敌。内战开始后，即将一切杂牌军调在第一线充当内战炮灰，以达消灭异己的目的。本团原建制归六十八师一一九旅（旅长为刘广信），去年鄄南战役时一一九旅被歼，旅长刘广信亦被俘，只剩下残余一二百人回去，后又以留守人员作为基础，整训八九个月，今年七月下旬，又逼令北上参加作战，调至鄄城最前线，再一次被迫替蒋介石充当内战炮灰。蒋介石此种毒辣手法，极堪痛恨。我们早有决心举行反内战起义，乃于九月十三日毅然在鄄城起义，将蒋记‘还乡团’、‘县政府’、‘保安队’全部解决后，经人民解放军的协助，开入黄河以北的解放区。”
    张团长并痛述西北军被蒋介石消灭、编散的情形称：“抗战时六十八军原有一三、一一九、三六等三个师，共九个团。抗战胜利后，被缩编为两个师，取消了三十六师的番号；第二军又缩编为六十六师两个旅（四个团）；六十九军本来是两个师六个团，编成一个旅两个团；十二军过去三个师（二○、二二、八一师），现只编成八十一旅两个团了。第二绥区冯治安部，原有三七、三八、一三二等六个师，每师合三个团，现在只剩下两个师四个旅。费县之役，又替蒋军当炮灰，三十八师全部被歼，师长翟扎三阵亡，三十七师消灭殆尽。五十五军曹福林部，郓城之役全部覆没，曹福林仅以身免。三十军本来三个师，缩编成两个旅，一个旅被歼灭，另一旅又在山西临汾被围。这都是蒋介石消灭异己，利用杂牌的铁证。但不管蒋介石如何拼命挣扎，其必然失败的命运，已无法挽回。蒋军内部，从高级军官到士兵，都害怕打仗，贪污腐化，已达极点。一个连长，一个月可贪污二百万以上的蒋币，一个团长每月搞四五千万元，已不算贪污。蒋军整个战争机构，已发生根本变化。其部队已大部丧失战斗力。”张团长继谈到对解放区的观感称：“在蒋管区看到的是贪污腐化，黑暗重重，人民极端痛苦、农村凋敝。到解放区后，看到农村充满蓬勃的新生气象，组织严密，人民文化提高，丰衣足食，赌博、娼妓、乞丐完全绝迹，这是建设新中国最好的典型。所到之处，男女老幼欢迎慰问，经过村庄，人民都把我们当成自己的手足一样，我们感到无限兴奋，受到很大鼓舞。我们一定要追随人民解放军与全国爱好和平民主人士之后，一致奋起，打倒卖国媚外的蒋介石的独裁统治，建立和平民主的新中国！”
