As long as the Ground Isn't Frozen, Just Keep Planting
Yangcheng and Other Counties Rush to Plant Catch Crops

[Reported from Taiyue on the 26th by this newspaper] Yangcheng, Qinshui, Fushan, Quwo, Yuanqu, and other counties are currently engaged in intensive planting of catch wheat, saying, "It's like going to the front line." Yuanqu's first district has already planted over 14,600 mu of catch wheat. Yanshan, Gulong, Beiciciying, and Dongfeng villages in Yangcheng have planted 12,506 mu. Lizhuang Village in Qinshui's sixth district has completed planting 2,673 mu of catch wheat. Fushan County has planted 80 percent of its total area. They are now continuing to expand wheat fields and increase the planting of counter-offensive wheat. Fushan's second district alone is increasing counter-offensive wheat by 3,000 mu. Yangcheng believes that "as long as the ground isn't frozen, just keep planting," planting as much as possible. During the catch crop process, men, women, the elderly, and those with partial labor capacity account for 80 percent of the workforce, and young women, in particular, have become the main force in catch cropping. In Fushan's Xiyaoli, the Yuexiu women's mutual aid group, with sixteen members, planted over 120 mu of catch wheat in five days, applying 50 loads of manure per mu, taking complete responsibility from carrying manure and plowing the land to operating the seed drill. In Yangcheng's Gulong, Wang Leisheng's mutual aid group, the fifteen-year-old Wang Shuang'e and the seventeen-year-old Wang Yu'e, spread manure on three mu in two half-days, equaling the work of two male full laborers. Male laborers are also working intensely. In Yanshan Village, Shangguan Yinkui, Wan Yi, and three other young men carry manure, using three buckets each, with five people doing the work of seven and a half. In Qinshui's Lizhuang Village, old men in their sixties and seventies are driving oxen to plow the land early in the morning, working all day without rest, their backs aching so much they can barely stand up straight, but they continue to plow and plant.

    地不冻只管种
    阳城等县抢种赶茬
    【本报太岳二十六日电】阳城、沁水、浮山、曲沃、垣曲等县现正紧张的赶种茬麦，他们说：“好比上火线”。垣曲一区已种起茬麦一万四千六百余亩，阳城岩山、固隆、北次营、董封四村已种了一万二千五百零六亩，沁水六区李庄村种完茬麦二千六百七十三亩，浮山全县均种了百分之八十。现继续扩大麦田，增种反攻麦，仅浮山二区即增种反攻麦三千亩。阳城是“地不冻只管种”多种一亩是一亩。在改茬过程中，男女老少半劳力占了劳力的百分之八十，特别是青年妇女又成为改茬中的主力军。浮山西要里岳秀妇女互助组，十六个人五天种完全庄茬麦一百二十余亩，并且每亩上粪五十担，从担粪犁地到摇耧，完全由他们担负。阳城固隆王累胜互助组里的十五岁的王双娥及十七岁的王玉娥两个闺女，两晌就匀粪三亩，能顶两个男全劳力。男劳力亦紧张万分，岩山村上官银魁、晚义等五个青年担粪，用三只桶担，五人就顶七个半人担。沁水李庄村六、七十的老汉，一清早就赶牛犁地，整天不休息，腰酸的直不起来了，还是在犁种。
