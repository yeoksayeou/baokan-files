　　Speak Frankly and Discuss Right and Wrong Seriously
  　Military Supply Deepens Land Reform Study
    [This newspaper dispatch] The land reform study within the Military Region Supply Department has reached a climax. By studying documents and comparing them with their own thoughts, everyone confessed their innermost thoughts during the land reform. Comrade Feng Fucai from the Audit Section said, "My family is a liberated household and received fruits [of the revolution], but I feel that today's policy aims to implement 'land to the tiller,' ensuring everyone has land to cultivate. I really can't bear to watch the masses' crude and violent acts and the beatings of landlords; it's really excessive." Comrade Cui Weimao from the Accounting Section said, "Listening to reports from higher levels, today's mass movement is to implement 'land to the tiller,' so why is it still necessary to beat, hang, and drag [people]...?" After these questions were raised, the leadership had everyone engage in a heated discussion. After several days of study and debate, they realized that there was a problem with their own thinking. They were wearing landlord-tinted glasses and failed to recognize how the landlords had oppressed and exploited the peasants in the past. They only saw the pitiful plight of the landlords being struggled against and failed to recognize that today's peasant uprising is justified in seeking revenge and settling accounts. The process of discovering problems and conducting in-depth debate and research is still ongoing. (Zhao Binghong)

　　坦白说出心里话认真讨论辨是非
  　军供深入土改学习
    【本报讯】军区供给部土改学习卷入高潮，研究文件对照思想，大家便互相扯出自己在土改中的心里话。审计科冯富财同志说：“我家是翻身户分到了果实，可是感到我们今天的政策是实行耕者有其田，人人有了地种为目的，对群众的那些粗举暴行与地主的挨打，实在看不下，真是闹的过火”。会计科崔蔚卯同志说：“听上级报告，今天的群运是实行‘耕者有其田’，为什么还要打、吊、拖，……”这些问题提出后，领导上便让大家热烈展开讨论，经几天的研究争论，他们认识到原是自己思想上有毛病，面上挂了地主眼镜，没认识到过去地主对农民是如何的压诈如何的剥削，只从现象上看见地主被斗的可怜，今天农民闹翻身就是应该复仇清算。现在仍是在发现问题与深入争论和研究中。（赵炳鸿）
