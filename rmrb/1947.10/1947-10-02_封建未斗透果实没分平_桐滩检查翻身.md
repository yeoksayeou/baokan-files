Feudalism Not Thoroughly Overthrown, Fruits Not Fairly Distributed
　　Tongtan Checks for Emancipation

　　[Report from our Zuoquan correspondent] According to the demands of the masses, the Tongtan Farmers' Association, during the lull between weeding and the ripening of the autumn harvest, convened a general meeting of all Farmers' Association members on September 12th. After Chairman Jia Fugui issued the call for "Checking Emancipation," County Chief Gong mobilized everyone to speak their minds and see how their emancipation was progressing. After the meeting, discussions were launched among the more than six hundred male and female Farmers' Association members in the village, organized by street and group. Immediately, over one hundred issues were raised, mainly concerning the incomplete elimination of feudalism and the unfair distribution of fruits. The farmers argued fiercely, especially regarding the fruit distribution. Based on this situation, the leadership first focused on the fruit issue, boldly supporting the masses to fully express their grievances. After five or six days (and nights) of small group meetings and discussions, the honest farmers spoke their true feelings. For example, the elderly woman Han Shuangquan, who usually didn't speak much at meetings, this time said that she hadn't been thoroughly emancipated and was still sharing a quilt with her family. The hired laborer Su Zhonglin fired the first shot at the First Street group meeting, saying, "Last year when distributing fruits, I was a 'hole-dweller' (person with nothing). I received a lot of land based on acreage, but it was all 'cannon emplacements' (mountainous land). I was allocated three rooms, but they are rotting and about to collapse!" This prompted some honest people who had opinions but were afraid to speak out to express themselves. Old man Zhao Kuishun said at the general meeting, "I came to Tongyu from She County and worked as a servant for more than twenty years. Last year, I was allocated two pieces of clothing: one was so rotten that it was used for patches, and the other my wife mended for two days but still couldn't wear. I was allocated two cattle pens, which were uninhabitable, so I'm still 'roaming the rafters' (looking for a place to live). Anyway, we outsiders are at a disadvantage!" This showed that the poor hired laborers had not been thoroughly emancipated and also reflected the masses' opinions on the cadres. At this time, the leadership allowed the masses to discuss the issues raised while also supporting the cadres and preventing landlords from exploiting loopholes, helping them examine and recognize the problems in their work. Immediately, a study of ideology was launched among the cadres. Farmers' Association Chairman Jia Fugui and Women's Rescue Chairman Li Renzhen first made self-criticisms, stating that they only cared about themselves when distributing fruits, did not compare themselves with "hole-dwellers," and should not have taken fruits without going through the masses. They truly felt sorry for the masses and were determined to return everything. Then, each main cadre made a self-criticism to the masses. Currently, concrete solutions to the unfair distribution of fruits are being implemented. Following this, a class assessment movement will be launched to remove feudal elements from the reorganization of the Farmers' Association. (Yin Long)

　　封建未斗透果实没分平
  　桐滩检查翻身
    【本报左权讯】桐滩农会根据群众要求，在锄苗已完秋禾未熟空间，于九月十二号召开了全体农会会员大会，由主席贾富魁同志发出“检查翻身”的号召后，巩县长动员大家有什说什，看自己翻身翻的怎样？会后便在全村六百余男女农会会员中，按街按组的展开酝酿，当即提出问题一百余件，内容主要包括封建消灭的不彻底和果实分配的不公平，特别对果实问题，农民争吵的相当激烈。领导上根据这种情况，首先抓住果实问题，大胆放手给群众撑腰，目的是让群众继续把牢骚发透。经过五六天（夜）时间的小组大会圪扯，老实农民们都说出了自己的真心话。如妇女韩双全老人，从来开会不好说话，这次也说出他还没有翻透身，到现在还是一家人伙盖一条被子。长工苏中林在一街小组会上打了头炮，他说：“去年分果实我是圪洞户，土地亩数分的到不少，可是都是些东西炮台（山地），房子分了三间，也烂的快塌呀！”这一下推动了一些有意见不敢说的老实人也发了言，赵魁顺老汉在大会上说：“我从涉县来到桐峪，住长工侍候人二十多年了，去年翻身我分了两件衣裳：一件烂的作了补丁，一件老婆补了两天还是不能穿。分了两间牛圈，不能住，到如今还是窜房椽（找人家房子住），反正咱这外路人是吃不开！”从此说明了贫雇还没翻透身，也反映了群众对干部的意见。这时领导上一面让群众对提出的问题进行讨论，一面给干部作主，防止地主钻空，帮助他们做检查，认识工作中的毛病。当即在干部中也展开了查思想的学习。农会主席贾富魁，妇救主席李认珍，首先做了反省，谈出分果实自己管自己，不与圪洞户比，更不应该不通过群众拿果实，真是对不起群众，决心一律退出来。接着每个主要干部都向群众作了检讨。目前正进行解决果实不公的具体问题。紧接着就要展开查阶级评成份运动，从整顿农会组织中挤掉封建。（印龙）
