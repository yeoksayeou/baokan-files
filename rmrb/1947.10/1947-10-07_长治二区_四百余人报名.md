　　Changzhi Second District
　　Over 400 People Sign Up
　　[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] On September 28th, the Second District convened an emergency mobilization meeting of village cadres for participation in the war. Comrade Guo, the secretary in charge, first pointed out the fatal flaws of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang. Then he reported many good news such as our army's southern expedition to uproot the old order and the great liberation of the people throughout the country. Everyone applauded like thunder and burst into laughter. Feng Village's political director said, "Sign up to participate in the war to uproot the old order, and capture Chiang Kai-shek's paper tiger!" Labor model Cao Linshui said: "The time to uproot the old order has come. The emancipated peasants must come out and expedite the conscription!" Everyone unanimously recognized: the counter-offensive must be launched together. Then the following two questions were raised for discussion: (1) How to combine participation in the war with the autumn harvest? Wang Youcai, the political director of Nanzhuang, said: "The mutual aid teams will divide the land of those participating in the war among certain people and groups to carry out the autumn harvest, implementing competition to ensure the best results!" Labor hero Er Yun said: "Use the contract system, estimate the labor of the land of those participating in the war, and settle the work points at any time. Guarantee to harvest the crops and prepare the land for them before they leave to participate in the war." Everyone said in unison: "If the cadres take action together, we guarantee that this war will have no difficulties!" (2) How to form a voluntary registration movement for participation in the war? Gaohe's political director said: "We have completely resolved the specific difficulties of the harvesting battle. Regarding clothes, shoes, and socks, the working women will help to make them. Inspire the masses to give a warm send-off, and everyone will support the war participants." The political director of Zhuzhuang said: "All the rice for the war participants, in addition to being used for wages, will be distributed to them in part to solve the expenses of participating in the war." Wang Ze, the political director of Sudian, said: "Let's have a celebration in every village to celebrate the initial victory of the comprehensive counter-offensive, making everyone celebrate and everyone happy. Participating in the war will definitely form a movement." As soon as these questions were studied, more than a dozen villages immediately competed to sign up voluntarily. Hao Dianhui, the chairman, said: "I guarantee to lead 30 militiamen from my village with good political quality and strong physiques." Huang Sanqiang, an activist of the Sudian militia, voluntarily signed up to participate in the war, leading 35 people from the whole village, with the condition that they must be good and will not run away. This influenced other villages to compete to sign up, and immediately 460 people were registered. The slogans of the whole field shook the sky, shouting: "Carry out a comprehensive counter-offensive, voluntarily participate in the war to make great contributions, follow the army on the southern expedition to uproot the old order, and liberate the people of the whole country!"
