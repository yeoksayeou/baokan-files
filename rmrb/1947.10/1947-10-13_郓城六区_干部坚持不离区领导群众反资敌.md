　　Yuncheng Sixth District
  　Cadres Persist in Staying in the District, Leading the Masses to Oppose Aiding the Enemy
    [Our newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 11th dispatch] The Sixth District of Yuncheng persists in fighting in the hinterland, actively opposes aiding the enemy, and has achieved significant results in cracking down on the puppet district headquarters' returning landlord militias who are conscripting soldiers and collecting money. On the third day of the eighth lunar month, after the enemy occupied Yuncheng, our Sixth District cadres and armed work teams continued to persist in villages around Xie Jing and Yu Miao, preparing to strike at the enemy at any time and safeguard the interests of the masses. When Li Zixiang (from Liqiao, Yuncheng), the puppet district chief of Yuncheng, and more than 50 other members of the returning landlord militia came to Chenlukou in the Sixth District, they knew that our district headquarters was still persisting in the area. Therefore, they did not dare to conscript soldiers or rob grain everywhere. However, because they had nothing to eat while stationed there, Li Zixiang was very worried. So he called a meeting of nine puppet township chiefs and said, "There is a Communist district headquarters not far from us, but we can't starve to death in Chenlukou. If we want to get silver, each township should pick a village chief who is good to us and ask him to take the lead in sending money. Also, send some daring people to send messages out, calling for the village chiefs of each village to come to a meeting in person, bringing two yuan of silver per mu of land. The village that delivers enough will let the village chief go back. The village that doesn't bring enough will be detained until they send enough." The puppet township chiefs also agreed to this method. On the afternoon of the fifth day of the eighth lunar month, Liu Zanshang, the puppet township chief of Guanren Township, issued an order, writing: "It is hereby decided to convene a meeting of all village chiefs in Chenlukou on the sixth day of the eighth lunar month, and to borrow two yuan of silver per mu of land. The village chiefs must bring the full amount. Those who do not come to the meeting or do not bring enough will be charged as Communists without exception. There is no falsehood in this order." He handed it over to Liu Chongqi of the returning landlord militia to deliver to Li Xianxi, the village chief of Shenqiao Village, and asked Li Xianxi to pass it on to other villages. That night, nearly at the first watch (7-9pm), the enemy's note really came out of Shenqiao. When the village chief of a certain village received this note from the enemy, which was demanding the lives of the entire village, he immediately handed it over to the district headquarters of the democratic government. That night, the district headquarters gathered a part of the militia and cadres, rushed to Shenqiao, arrested the village chief Li Xianxi, and then went to Houhuzhuang to drag the returning landlord militia member Liu Chongqi out of bed, scaring him into a trembling mess. After arresting them, although no notice was issued, many villagers already knew about it, and they spread the word: "The district has arrested the returning landlord militia. After arresting these bastards, we can sleep peacefully and eat a peaceful meal." Some also said: "Now we don't have to pay two yuan of silver per mu of land." On the morning of the sixth day of the eighth lunar month, at the request of the masses, the returning landlord militia member Liu Chongqi was executed, and Li Xianxi, the village chief of Shenqiao Village who aided the enemy, was also replaced. Li Zixiang was so frightened that his face turned ashen, and his subordinates did not dare to leave the village to conscript soldiers and rob grain. The masses happily said: "The returning landlord militia are wolves that can never get enough to eat. They give you this time and that time, and when the wolves are fattened, they will eat people even more fiercely. If everyone works together to kill the wolves, we will never be harmed by them again!" "As long as the returning landlord militia doesn't get lost, feel free to come and ask for silver dollars!" Therefore, the masses have now actively established a mass intelligence network to strike at the enemy at any time, and the struggle against aiding the enemy has thus created a mass-based conscious movement.

　　郓城六区
  　干部坚持不离区领导群众反资敌
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】郓城六区坚持腹地斗争，积极反资敌，打击伪区部还乡团抓丁收款，获得显著成绩。古历八月初三日，敌人进占郓城后，我六区干部、武工队，仍在谢井、于庙一带村庄坚持，准备随时打击敌人，维护群众利益。当郓城伪六区长李自祥（郓城李桥人）等还乡团五十余人，来到六区陈路口住下后，知道我区部仍坚持地区，因此不敢到处抓丁、抢粮，但因守着没有吃的，李自祥很是发愁，于是他召集九个伪乡长开会，说：“离咱不远就有八路区部，可是咱也不能饿死在陈路口，要想把白银弄到手，就是各乡挑个对咱好点的村长，叫他开头送，另外派几个大胆的人，到外送信，叫各村村长亲自来开会，每亩地带两元现洋，那村送够让村长回去，那村带不够就押起来，啥时送够再放回。”各伪乡长也很同意这个办法。八月初五下午，伪关人乡乡长刘赞尚下了一道命令，写着：“兹定于八月六日在陈路口召开各村长会议，并借每亩现洋两元，村长要如数带来，如有不来开会者，或带不够者，一律按八路军论罪，绝无谎言，此令。”交还乡团刘重启先送到沈桥村长李现洗那里，叫李现洗再往外村传送。当夜将近一更天的时候，敌人的条子真的从沈桥传出来了，当我某村村长接到敌人的这个要全村人命的条子后，便马上交到民主政府区部，当夜区部集合了一部民兵和干部，赶到沈桥，把村长李现洗捉起来，接着又到后胡庄，把还乡团刘重启也从被窝里拉出来，吓得他混身筛糠，腿肚转筋。捉着他俩后，虽没下通知，可是很多村子老百姓都已经知道了，纷纷传说：“区里捉着了还乡团，捉着这些孬种后，可睡个安稳觉，吃顿安生饭了。”也有的说：“现在每亩地可不用出两块现洋了。”八月初六上午，在群众要求下，把还乡团刘重启处死，把资敌的沈桥村长李现洗也换了配角。李自祥知道后，吓的面变土色，喽罗们也不敢出村子抓丁抢粮了。群众均欢喜的说：“还乡团是吃不饱的狼，给这次还有那次，把狼养肥了，吃人更厉害，大家伙一齐心，把狼杀掉，就再也不受他的害啦！”“只要还乡团不滚蛋，有种尽管来要银元吧！”因此群众现已积极建立大众情报网，随时打击敌人，反资敌斗争遂造成了群众性的自觉运动。
