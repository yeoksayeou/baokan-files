A Hero Who Overturned His Fate: Li Baohai

	I. A Society Where Good People Have No Way to Survive

	I am from Yinzhuang Village, Dongxiang, Pingding. My father's name was Li Jincheng. He lost both his parents when he was three years old and was raised by his older sister. At the age of seven, he herded cattle, and when he grew up, he worked as a long-term laborer for landlords. It wasn't until he was in his forties that he switched to renting land to farm. He married a woman in his thirties. He never had a good day in the first half of his life, always eating one meal and worrying about the next. If he didn't work for a day, he would go hungry. I remember when I was eight years old, our whole family moved from Yinzhuang Village to Muko Mountain, ten miles away from the village. We rented a mountain plot from the landlord Li Yinghua and started to cultivate wasteland, paying two shi of rent each year. Later, because we harvested more grain, the landlord wanted to raise the rent from two shi to four shi. Even so, our family became stronger year by year, developing from one donkey to three. When the landlord saw this, he became envious and thought it was a piece of meat. He gave my father the glorious title of "Backer Landlord" (because our family lived on the mountain), and that was the beginning of our family's misfortune. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, Pingding suffered a major famine. I was only fifteen years old that year. In May and June, there was nothing to eat. Everyone elected my father as a representative to mortgage our three donkeys to my aunt's family in exchange for one shi and five dou of millet and corn. Fifteen families each divided one dou and ate it, all at five percent interest. At the time, we didn't care if the interest was high. Even double the interest wouldn't have mattered. What was one dou per family? People can't live on credit. In the autumn, they would harvest some grain. Could they not return one dou? Unexpectedly, it turned out completely different. In the autumn, there was no harvest at all. The fifteen households in the whole village, seeing that the situation was not good, all fled, leaving only our two families. In September after the autumn harvest, my uncle brought several helpers to our house to demand payment, saying, "Child! It's a year of people eating people. How are you going to repay the grain you borrowed?" My father had no choice but to give the two donkeys as payment for the one shi and five dou of grain, settling the principal. He begged and pleaded, citing the family relationship, and they left us one broken donkey. In the first half of the tenth year of the Republic of China, out of the one hundred and fifty households in Yinzhuang Village, more than one hundred and seventy people starved to death, and more than one hundred and twenty fled. Of course, we were no exception. The whole family fell ill. My five-year-old brother and nine-year-old sister both starved to death. The donkey died of hunger, and my father was so hungry at home that he went to work as a laborer in a foreign factory. Our family of four was truly like "a dung beetle crying for its father," completely lost. We felt there was no way to go to heaven and no door to enter hell, waiting only to starve to death. Fortunately, my father returned from working in the foreign factory, gave my eldest sister away as a child bride, and traded my third sister for a cabbage. We three people, with tears streaming down our faces, fled to Shutou Village in Heshun and settled down. My father and I worked as long-term laborers for others, and my mother cooked for the landlord. We also rented ten mu of sloping land to farm. Each year was better than the last, and the family had food and clothing. My father also stopped working as a long-term laborer and returned home to farm. My mother and I continued to work for others. That year, we rented a mountain plot from Zhang Guanyin in Nanzhuanggou and opened up eight mu of wasteland. It was originally agreed that there would be no rent for three years, but after one year of planting, they wouldn't let us plant anymore. In the second year, they demanded one shi of rent, and in the third year, they took the land away. But I was not discouraged and always endured. That year, my mother gave birth to a child, who died for no good reason. Someone said, "There's a fox spirit in this house you're living in." So I sold one shi of soybeans and one shi of rice, and for sixty strings of cash, I mortgaged a courtyard from Li Zhenxi, replastered the house, and built a donkey pen, preparing to live a peaceful life. But they wouldn't let us live there, and only gave us six strings of cash, buying a bucket and a plow, and kept my fifty-four strings of cash without giving them back. I cultivated wasteland every year, and each year I could harvest more than twenty shi of grain. Li Zhenxi saw this and became envious, so he and the surname Bai competed for my rented land. As a result, we fought a lawsuit in the city for forty days, and the wasteland that I had just cultivated for three or four years was taken away. From then on, my misfortune came again, and it was another period of hunger. In the year of the Incident, when the Eighth Route Army first arrived, the landlord, in order to evade burdens, had me work on sixty mu of land for him. I didn't know the man had ulterior motives. I was secretly happy that I was going to get rich, but in the autumn, after dividing the harvest between the two families, I was left with nothing but empty hands. I worked as a long-term laborer for a year to pay off the debt. When the enemy occupied Heshun, I couldn't even find a long-term job. If I worked as a long-term laborer for others, I would still have to pay corvée labor. My barren and thin land had to bear the same burden as the landlord's good land. In 1942, there was nothing to eat, and the whole family ate wild vegetables, and our faces turned green. Later, I moved to the mountains to live. When the Eighth Route Army's work penetrated into our village, the work team constantly came to my village and saw that I was eating chaff and wild herbs, with my skin exposed, looking inhuman. They exempted me from corvée labor.

	II. Overthrowing the "Pig Cage Lord," Becoming a Hero

	After liberation in 1945, I still lived in the mountains. My thinking was still backward. Zhang Furong, the chairman of the farmers' association, asked me to give my opinion about the landlord Zhang Yinzong. I said, "I have no opinion." Everyone knew that I was the poorest and had suffered the most. Zhang Yinzong took my livestock, but I refused to say anything. Others gave an opinion on my behalf. The first time, they calculated that he owed me twenty-four mu of land, six dou of corn, and three thousand yuan in silver dollars. I had land to cultivate, grain to eat, and money to spend. I was so happy that I couldn't speak when I saw the work team. I bought twelve leather belts for the militia to thank them. I kowtowed to every god I saw. I thought that since I had turned over, I had to burn more incense and kowtow more! So my brother and I worked as day laborers for four days and bought half a jin of meat, offering four liang at the village mountain temple. I wrote a memorial tablet on the mountain where I lived and offered four liang there too. I thought wolves were very dangerous, so I had to worship the Mountain God well. Otherwise, what would I have turned over for if I was eaten by a wolf? On September 27th, three landlords were struggled against. I was in the process of distributing the fruits of the struggle when my father cried out and ran back to the village, saying that a wolf had bitten my brother's face and gnawed on his neck. I rushed back and, sure enough, he was badly bitten. I prayed in front of the Mountain God, "Heaven! If you protect my brother from dying, I will return all the fruits I have received." I thought that struggling against the landlord was a punishment from the Mountain God. From then on, I didn't dare to boldly struggle against the landlords. Conscience, fate, and superstition shrouded my thinking. The work in Shutou Village also declined. The landlords took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying that the liquidation was unreasonable, that there was an order from above, and that those who received the fruits of the struggle had to return them. My thinking became more and more turbulent, and I personally asked the district chief Shi, but my heart was always wavering. In November, various places were reducing rent. Farmers' association members throughout the village discussed whom to struggle against and how to struggle. Everyone lowered their heads and didn't speak. Some said that the struggle was almost over and there was no need to struggle anymore. Some said that the "Pig Cage Lord" in our village was very powerful and that we couldn't bear the consequences of liquidating the landlord. The next evening, a meeting of the farmers' association was called. They didn't mention struggling against anyone, but only discussed how gods came about and where we could find the root of the gods. Everyone was talking nonsense, with some saying that Jiang Ziya had created them, some saying that there were gods in heaven, and some saying that they had seen ghosts but not gods. Later, I told everyone about the wolf biting my brother. The more I talked, the angrier I became, and I cursed: "Who says there are gods? Bullshit! I paid respects to him the day before yesterday, and two days later he bit my brother. What kind of bastard god is that?!" After I said this, everyone discussed again and concluded that there were no gods, but that the landlords had built temples and created gods and ghosts to deceive us poor people. The discussion became more and more lively. An old man said, "The children say there are no gods. Who dares to go with me to smash the Pig Cage Lord?" Immediately, many young militiamen said, "I'll go, I'll go!" In a moment, a group of people gathered and ran to the temple, smashing the statue of the god. From then on, I went from being a group leader to becoming the chairman of the farmers' association and joined the Party. Without the oppression of gods, the villagers no longer talked about superstition or conscience. My brother's wound also healed, and he constantly came down from the mountains to watch the struggle meetings. In my accusations, I realized that my ancestors' poverty was caused by the landlords, and I resentfully thought of fighting the landlords. I first colluded with three hired laborers, and those three hired laborers then colluded with twelve poor peasants. They were all very enthusiastic and willing to immediately fight the landlords. I felt that the strength was not yet great enough, so I also found Chi, a poor woman, and brought along nineteen female activists. In this way, from small to large, out of the eighty-three households in the village, fifty-two were united. With more people, we had more courage and higher plans. The indignant peasants struggled against the blood-sucking landlords Zhang Dehong and three others, dug out silver dollars, took out bundles, and distributed 1,600 mu of land to the basic masses. The entire village achieved "land to the tiller." During the Lunar New Year, I was busy with work and didn't go home. It wasn't until the third day of the New Year that I returned home. Unexpectedly, when I returned home, there was meat and white flour. It turned out that the masses had secretly sent it to my family during the New Year. My heart was moved to tears. Remembering that in the past, there was nothing to eat or drink during the New Year, and no one cared, I felt another pang of heartache. Even now, when talking about the masses' concern and love for me, I always feel that I have let them down. I haven't distributed many fruits of the struggle to myself, always distributing them to others first, often saying to people, "As long as everyone is rich, if everyone helps me with one finger, it will be enough for me to live." Last autumn, when selecting heroes who had overturned their fate, the peasants unanimously elected me to attend the Border Region Hero Conference.

	III. Large-Scale Production Mutual Aid, Developing a Good Time

	After turning over, I served as the political director. At that time, the higher-ups proposed large-scale production. I felt that it was not as easy to lead as turning over. Turning over was about gaining benefits, while mutual aid was about enduring hardship. However, after attending the county production conference and listening to the experiences of various places, I understood. I thought: At the beginning, turning over was also very difficult. As long as we use our brains and discuss it in meetings, there will definitely be a way. So I first held a meeting to let everyone discuss what problems there were with last year's production mutual aid. Zhang Baofu said: "Last year, some people participated in mutual aid unwillingly. The tickets were divided too much, and there were many losses in searching inside and out. The wages owed couldn't be paid, and we didn't dare to speak up." I seized these problems and decided that this year's mutual aid would absolutely be voluntary. The tickets would be printed in denominations of 2.5 cents, so there would be no losses in finding change, and wages would be determined according to the season. Everyone said that this was about right. I also proposed that the slow bird should fly first and strive for early planting. First, we resolved the outstanding issues in mutual aid. The whole village mutual aid regulated two shi of naked oat seeds and one shi and seven dou of black bean seeds, and borrowed two shi and two dou of grain to the surname Qiao, solving his food shortage problem, unblocking the thinking of a lazy person, and using the actual benefits obtained through mutual aid to influence Gouhai. After unblocking the thinking of all kinds of people, we launched a large-scale mutual aid in the whole village. In the spring production mutual aid, we saved a lot of labor. We drew forty people from each group to sell labor in Xia Village, earning 16,000 yuan in silver dollars a day. The whole village bought seven small sows. Two were bitten to death by dogs. From five, we have now developed to seventy-two. This summer, during drought resistance and famine preparation, everyone was worried about having nothing to eat and wanted to sell the pigs. I came up with a rotating pig-feeding method. We only fed them once a day, which saved grain and made the pigs fat. This laid the foundation for pig raising in the whole village. When the enemy occupied Shutou Village, they killed and ate all the chickens. I also paid attention to raising chickens. The whole village developed from twelve chickens to 992, an average of twelve per household. After the masses turned over, the whole village had twelve cattle, but only four cows. If we fed them for a long time, they would only decrease and not increase. Therefore, I sold the silk and castrated cattle that I had struggled for and exchanged them for cows. In nearly a year, the whole village has developed to sixty-eight heads. By the end of the year, each household will have to raise a cow, large and small. In saving and preparing for famine, I took the lead, using my own historical pain to unblock the masses' muddled thinking obstacles, regulating nine shi and six dou of buckwheat seeds and three jin and twelve liang of rapeseed, calling on the masses of the whole village to plant more buckwheat and more vegetables, and beat more than 17,000 jin of wild vegetables (dried), preparing to tide over next year's famine.

　　翻身英雄李保孩
  　　　　　一、好人无活路的社会
    我是平定东乡银庄村人，我父亲叫李金成，他三岁上爹娘都下世了，靠姐姐恩养大，七岁上就放牛，大了给人家地主住长工，一直到四十多岁，才改行租地种，三十多岁狂骗的娶了个女人，前半辈没好活一天，总是吃一顿闹一顿，吃一天闹一天，一天不动就饿肚。记的我那年八岁，全家由银庄村里搬到离村十里地的墓口山上，租了地主李映华一架山，开始刨荒地，每年出租两石，后因打的粮食多了，地主便要涨租，由两石涨到四石，这样我家还是一年比一年强，后来由一头毛驴发展到三头，这时地主看见眼红了，觉得是块肉，便送我父亲为“靠山财主”（因我家在山上住）这个光荣的称号，便是我家倒霉的开始。民国九年平定遭了大灾荒，那年我才十五岁，五六月没吃的，大家推我父亲为代表，把我家三头毛驴质上，向我姑家借了一石五斗谷子玉茭，十五家每家一斗分开吃了，都是加五利，当时也不嫌利高，就是加倍利也不要紧，一家才一斗呢？债不住人，秋天他多少要打点粮食，难道一斗还给不起人家吗？不想完全出了意料之外，到了秋天就是颗粒不收，全庄十五户，看见风色不好了，都向外逃，只留下我们两户，秋后九月天我姑父带的几个帮手，到我家要帐了，说：“孩子！人吃人的年景，你的借粮如何办？”我父亲没办法了，便把两头毛驴作了一石五斗粮食，给人家顶了本钱，不知给说了多少好话，念了亲戚关系，给留下一头坏的没拉走。民国十年前半年，全银庄村一百五十户人家，饿死了一百七十余口人，逃走一百廿余口，当然我们亦不能例外，全家病了，我的弟五岁、妹九岁都饿死了，毛驴生了肚底黄亦死了，我父亲在家饿的没办法，修洋工走了，全家四口人真是“屎巴牛哭他爹”两眼摸黑，想上天无路，入地无门，只等饿死。幸亏我父亲修洋工回来，把大妹童养了，三妹一颗白菜换给人家，我们三口人一把鼻涕一把泪，逃到和顺梳头村安了家。我和父亲给人家住长工，我母亲给地主做饭，还稍租种十亩坡地，一年好似一年，家里有吃有穿了，我父亲亦不住长工了，回到家里自耕自种，我和我母亲仍在外边给人家做活。那年在南庄沟租了张观音锁一架山，开了八亩荒地，原来说定三年不出租，不想种了一年不叫种了，第二年给出了一石租，第三年就把地下了。但我并不灰心总是死受。那年我母亲生了个孩子，好好的死了，有人说：你住的这个家里有狐狸精，我便卖了一石小豆一石米，六十吊钱典到李贞喜一串院，把房都重泥了，盖了一坐驴圈，准备如如贴贴过个好光景，结果人家不叫住了，只给了六吊钱，买了一个桶一张犁，把我五十四吊钱，都吭了不给。我年年刨荒地，每年能打二十多石粮，李贞喜看见眼红了，便与姓白的相互争夺我这块租地，结果在城里打了四十天官司，把我刚刨出三、四年的荒地都下了，从此我的恶运又来了，又是一段饥饿。事变那年，八路军刚来，地主为了逃避负担，叫我给人家伙种了六十亩地，我不知道人家有鬼算盘，受死受活，暗喜可要发财啦，不想到了秋天两家一分，除了负担又落个两手空，住了一年长工才把亏空顶清。敌人占了和顺，自己连长工都找不到，给人家住长工，自己还得出夫，我的烂坡薄地，和地主好地一样出负担，四二年没吃的，全家人都吃菜，面皮都变成了绿色，后我便搬到山上住，八路军工作深入到我村，工作员不断到我庄子上，看见我吃糠咽菜赤皮露肉不象人样，便把我的差夫负担免了。
    　　　　二、打倒猪笼爷，翻身当英雄
    四五年解放后，我仍住在山上，思想还是落后，农会主席张福荣叫我给地主张银中提意见，我说：“咱没意见。”大家知道我最穷，受痛苦最多，张银中拉过我的牲口，我死活没提，别人才替我提了个意见。头一次给我算到地二十四亩，玉茭六斗，大洋三千元，我有了地种，有粮食吃，有钱化，见了工作员喜的说不出话来，给民兵买了十二根皮带，谢民兵的恩，见了神神就叩头，我以为自己翻了身，可得多烧香多叩头哩！所以我和弟弟打了四天短工，买到半斤肉，在村里山神庙上供献了四两，我住的山上写了个牌位，也供献了四两，我以为狼很厉害，可得好好敬奉山神爷哩，不然翻了身叫狼吃了，翻了个啥？九月廿七日斗争了三家地主，我正在分配果实，我父一道喊，一道哭，跑回村来了，说狼把我弟脸咬了，啃了脖子，我连忙跑回，果不然咬的很利害，我便在山神跟前祷告：“天啊！你要保佑我弟死不了，我把所得的果实，都要退出来。”我以为斗了地主，山神爷报应的，从此不敢大胆斗争地主了，良心、命运、迷信把我思想笼罩住了，梳头村工作也消沉了，地主趁机造谣说：清算的不合理，上边有命令，得到果实户要退，我思想越动荡起来了，并亲自问了石区长，但我心里总是动摇不定。到十一月各地都在减租，全村农会会员讨论斗争谁？怎样斗？大家都低着头不说话，有的说闹的差不多了，不用斗了，有的说咱村猪龙爷很灵，清算了地主，给咱个报应可受不了。第二天晚上召集农会开会，不提斗争谁，只提神是怎样来的，咱们找神根吧，大家七言八语乱扯了起来，有的说是姜子牙封的，有的说是天上有神，有的说我见过鬼没见过神。后来我把狼咬我弟弟的事对大家谈了，越说越生气，就骂起来了：谁说有神，有他娘个屁，我前天敬了他，隔了两天就把我兄弟咬了，那里有这种坏蛋神？！我这样一说，大家又讨论，结果认为没神，是老财们给盖的庙院，弄的神鬼，欺骗咱穷人，讨论中越说越热闹，有个老汉说：“孩们说没神，谁敢跟我去打猪龙爷？”马上有好多青年民兵们说，我去，我去！一会儿凑了一群人，跑到庙里把神像打烂了，从此我就由小组长担任了农会主席，并参加了党。村里人没有了神的压制，也就不再讲什么迷信、良心了。我兄弟的伤口也好了，不断从山上回来看开斗争会。我在诉苦中想开了我的祖辈受穷是地主给造下的，就愤恨的想起来和地主干一场。我先串通了三个雇工，由三个雇工又串通了十二个贫农，都劲头很大，愿意马上和地主干一场，我感觉力量还不大，又找了赤贫妇女枝，又带起了十九个妇女积极分子来，这样由小到大，全村八十三户，就团结了五十二户，人多胆大计划高，激愤的农民斗争了喝血的地主张德宏等四个，刨出白洋拿出包袱，把一千六百亩土地分给了基本群众，全村实现了耕者有其田。过阴历年时，我因工作忙没回家，大年初三才回去，不想回到家里，有肉又有白面，原来是群众在过年时，瞒着我给家送的，心里感动的落下泪来，想起过去过年没吃没喝，没人理，又是一阵心酸，直到现在，谈起群众对我的关心与爱戴，总觉得自己对不起群众。我没多分过果实，总是先分给别人，常对人说：“只要大家富了，一人帮我一指头，也够我活。”去秋选翻身英雄，农民一致举我出席边区英雄会。
    　　　　三、生产大互助，发展好时光
    翻身以后，我担任了政治主任，当时上边提出了大生产，我思想上感觉，不如翻身好领导，翻身是得利，互助是受苦，可是我参加了县生产大会后，听了各地经验才想通，我想：一开始翻身也是很难，只要肯用脑筋，大家开会商量，一定会有办法，就先开会让大家讨论去年的生产互助有啥毛病，张保福说：“去年参加互助有些不自愿，分票的分太大，里找外找吃亏很大，欠的工资给不了，也不敢说话。”我抓住了这些毛病，决定了今年互助绝对采取自愿，分票印成二分五的，零找不吃亏，工资按季节决定。大家说这一下可差不多了，我又提出笨鸟先飞，争取早种，首先解决了互助中的遗留问题，全村互助调剂了两石莜麦籽，一石七斗黑豆籽，给姓乔的借了二石二斗粮食，解决了他的食粮困难问题，打通了一个懒汉的思想，用互助起来实际得到的利益，影响了狗孩。经过了打通各色人等的思想后，展开了全村的大互助，在春季大生产互助中，省了不少的工，在各组抽了四十人到下庄村卖工，一天赚了大洋一万六千元，全村买了七口小母猪，狗咬死两口，由五口到现在已发展到七十二口，在今夏抗旱备荒，大家都发愁没吃的，想把猪卖掉，我给想了个轮流放猪办法，每天只喂一顿，粮食又节省，猪吃的又胖。奠定了全村养猪基础。梳头村敌人占时都把鸡杀吃了，我亦注意了养鸡，全村由十二只鸡发展到九百九十二只，每户平均到十二只。群众翻身后，全村共有十二头牛，只有四头母牛，这样长期喂下去只有减少，不能增加，因此我把斗争出来的绸缎和犍牛卖掉，换成母牛，将近一年时间，全村已发展到六十八头，赶年底每户要大小喂到一头牛，在节约备荒上我先起带头，用自己的历史痛苦，打通了群众的思想糊涂障碍，调剂了荞麦种籽九石六斗，菜子三斤十二两，号召全村群众多种荞麦多种菜，并打了野菜（干的）一万七千余斤，准备明年渡灾荒。（和顺县委宣传部）
