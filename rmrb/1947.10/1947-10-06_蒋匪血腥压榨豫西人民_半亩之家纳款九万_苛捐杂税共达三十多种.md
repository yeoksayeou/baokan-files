Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 4th—Under the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Western Henan, the people's burden of grain and money is extraordinarily heavy. According to preliminary investigations in several villages, there are as many as twenty or thirty kinds of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. According to the payment receipts of the "Renyi Tang" pharmacy in the city, the items include: Self-Defense Force expenses, township subsidies, monthly military grain for household registration personnel, machine team bullet fees, district office miscellaneous expenses, meeting record fees, Self-Defense Force military grain, machine training soldier expenses, interim expenses, gun expenses, Self-Defense soldier expenses, conscription expenses, machine soldier expenses, alternate expenses, merchant fees, public expenses, district and township office monthly donations, lime money, bandit suppression expenses, Dragon Boat Festival consolation farmer top-up, Self-Defense soldier monthly donations, district soldier expenses, Self-Defense Force firewood expenses, city wall construction expenses, warehouse grain, city repair expenses, assigned guard household soldier expenses, Self-Defense annihilation team expenses, substitute electric settlement expenses, miscellaneous expenses, etc. Some of these are temporary apportionments, but most are paid monthly. Renyi Tang paid more than 40 times in half a year from February to August this year, totaling more than 600,000 yuan. The burden on farmers is heavier than that on merchants. In addition to the absence of chamber of commerce fees, there are also military rations, land taxes, wooden boards, wood, and corvée labor. Last year, a farmer named Sun Xiao-san was forced by the Chiang Kai-shek army to repair trenches and became sick from exhaustion. His family only has ten acres of land and has to pay seven silver dollars in land tax, each yuan converted into sixty catties of grain, and an additional fifteen catties of military grain are levied per acre, for a total of 570 catties of grain. From March to August this year, he has already paid 315,000 yuan in dozens of donations. Zhou Yu-shan, who only has half an acre of land, has also paid more than 90,000 yuan. In addition to the fact that the majority of farmers' grain is handed over to the government, the pigs they raise and the cotton they grow also have to be taxed. Landlords and local bullies' extortion and exploitation of farmers is even more endless. When the Japanese invaders occupied this township, the landlord ran away, asking the farmer Zhou Yu-shan to take care of his house and provide him with one shi of grain. The following year, after the Japanese invaders surrendered, the landlord forced Zhou Yu-shan to return two shi, the market price at that time was 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per shi, but the landlord calculated it for him at 40,000 yuan per shi, resulting in the return of three shi of grain. Last year, he borrowed 20,000 yuan from the landlord to do business, and later could not pay it back, so the landlord seized four acres of good land. The vast number of farmers, after this layer-by-layer exploitation, have been unable to live. Upon learning that the People's Liberation Army had established a democratic government here, everyone rejoiced and celebrated.

　　蒋匪血腥压榨豫西人民
  　半亩之家纳款九万
  　苛捐杂税共达三十多种
    【新华社豫西前线四日电】豫西在蒋匪血腥统治下，人民粮款负担奇重。据在几乡初步调查，苛杂名目多至二、三十种。据城内“仁义堂”药铺缴款收据所载，计有：自卫队经费、乡津贴、户籍人员月份军粮、机务队子弹费、区公所杂款、会议记录费、自卫队军粮、机务训练兵款、经临费、枪款、自卫兵款、派兵款、机务兵款、候补款、商费、公款、区、乡公所月份捐、石灰钱、剿匪经费、端阳节慰劳农民顶款、自卫兵月份捐、区兵款、自卫队烧柴款、打城墙款、仓库粮、修城款、派守户兵款、自卫清剿队费、代电安家款、杂款等。其中有些是临时摊派，但大部都是按月要交的。仁义堂从今年二月到八月半年内就出款四十多次，共计六十多万元。农民负担比商人更重。除了没有商会款外，却另有军粮、田赋、木板、木头及差役等。农民孙小三去年被蒋军迫修战壕，累得吐血。他家仅有十亩土地，共需出田赋七块大洋，每元合成六十斤粮食，每亩地额外又征十五斤军粮，一共就出粮食五百七十斤。从今年三月到八月已出几十种捐款三十一万五千元。仅有半亩地的周玉山也出款达九万多元。农民们除了粮食大部交官外，养的猪、种的棉都得交款。地主恶霸对于农民讹诈剥削更是层出不穷。在日寇占领此乡时，地主逃跑，叫农民周玉山给他看家，并供给他一石粮食。第二年日寇投降，地主即逼迫周玉山还两石，当时市价每石二、三万元，地主却给他按四万元一石计算，结果还了三石粮食。去年他借了地主的两万元做买卖，后来还不起，被地主夺去了四亩好地。广大农民经此层层剥削，已经无法生活，得知解放军在此建立民主政权，莫不欢欣庆幸。
