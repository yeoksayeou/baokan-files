Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Reports from various sources: The US imperialists' activities to undermine the United Nations and their clamoring to provoke a new war have aroused strong attacks from democratic leaders and progressive public opinion in many countries. Yugoslav Marshal Tito, in a speech at the founding conference of the Veterans' Federation in Belgrade on September 30, condemned the United States for "attempting to undermine the United Nations and force the Soviet Union to withdraw," pointing out, "They will surely fail." Tito pointed out, "The United States wants to split the United Nations and establish an imperialist front to resist democratic countries, but I declare that we will never allow its attempts to succeed." Tito strongly condemned the instigators of a new war; and emphasized: "The democratic forces of the world are extremely strong, so it is not easy for imperialism to realize its plan to provoke a new war. We are prepared to resist at any cost and effort, any country that dares to infringe upon our freedom and independence." Former US Vice President Wallace recently stated at a mass meeting hosted by the Harvard University branch of the US Veterans Committee: "We cherish world peace, and we should not let Morgan's partners be the Secretary of Defense." Wallace denounced the Marshall Plan as "a replica of the Hoover Plan"; he declared that he "will oppose congressional appropriations for the implementation of the Marshall Plan to direct the internal affairs of any country." Lawrence, editor of the US News Magazine, recently wrote an article condemning the US representative's opposition to the veto power, calling it "committing the crime of deception and supporting the pseudo-Chiang." Brazilian progressive newspapers on the 2nd unanimously praised the Soviet Union's firm attitude at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it "part of the struggle to uphold peace and good relations between countries"; and denounced the blackmail of the American war-mongers, believing that: "Due to the firm policies of freedom-loving and peace-loving countries, the war agitators' plans will surely be bankrupt."

　　美图破坏联合国挑拨新战争
  　世界与论群起攻击
    【新华社陕北五日电】各方讯：美帝国主义破坏联合国的活动，及其挑拨新战争之叫嚣，引起了许多国家民主领袖与进步舆论的强烈攻击。南斯拉夫总理铁托元帅九月三十日在贝尔格莱德退伍军人联合会成立大会上发表演说，谴责美国“正企图破坏联合国，并压迫苏联退出”，指出：“他们必将失败。”铁托指出：“美国想分裂联合国，并成立帝国主义阵线以反抗民主国家，但我声明我们永远不允许其企图之实现”。铁托力斥新战争挑拨者；并强调：“世界民主力量极为强大，所以帝国主义是不容易实现其挑拨新战争之计划的，我们准备不惜任何牺牲和努力去反抗，敢侵犯我们自由和独立的国家。”美前副总统华莱士顷在美退伍军人委员会哈佛大学分会所主持的群众大会上力称：“我们宝贵世界和平，我们不应让摩根的伙伴任国防部长。”华氏斥马歇尔计划为“胡佛计划之翻版”；他声言“将反对由国会拨款实行马歇尔计划以指挥任何国家的内政”。美新闻杂志编辑劳伦斯近撰文谴责美代表之反否决权称：这是“犯了欺骗与伪蒋的罪行”。巴西进步报纸于二日一致盛赞苏联在联合国大会上之坚定态度，称之“为和平与各国间良好关系坚持奋斗的一部分”；并痛斥美国战争贩子的敲诈行为，认为：“由于爱好自由和平各国的坚定政策，战争鼓动者的计划必遭破产”。
