【This newspaper, Taiyue, 23rd dispatch】 After liberation, in the newly liberated areas of western Henan, over 5,000 people in the Huixing Township of Shanzhou participated in the struggle to distribute grain and land, seizing back over 17,000 mu of land, 70 houses, over 80 head of livestock, and grain from landlords and despots. During the Anti-Japanese War, this area suffered four disasters in a row: flood, drought, locusts, and Tang (referring to Tang Enbo's army). In the past year, the area has suffered even more from the Kuomintang bandits' exorbitant taxes and levies, conscription, and forced labor, which has left every household without grain, every family without land, and every village without able-bodied men. When our army liberated the area, poor people requested grain distribution because they had no food to eat, but because scattered bandits were robbing everywhere, the masses were initially afraid to explicitly demand grain distribution. At the end of September, the leadership, on one hand, mobilized the masses to capture scattered bandits and, on the other hand, led the grain distribution struggle. The scattered bandits were quickly captured, and revolutionary order was stabilized. Over 800 people participated in the grain distribution struggle, but the masses still had concerns, fearing a counterattack from the landlords and despots, so they spontaneously organized armed self-defense. At this time, the masses immediately became active. Song, an old man from Hou Village, volunteered and said: "I'll go find Xue from Tian Village; he's a poor man." In addition to contacting the poor people of Tian Village, Xue also led Liu Shuanchang from Hedi, Lü Changfa from Siguan Village, and others to contact the poor people of their own villages to start the struggle. The poor people of each village colluded with each other, totaling about 5,000 men and women, and further demanded the distribution of the landlords' land and the capture of local tyrants, creating a major struggle. Currently, in the 14 natural villages within 30 li to the east and 20 li to the north and south of the township, peasant associations have been established to lead the poor peasants and hired laborers in the struggle to distribute land and grain.

【This newspaper, Taiyue, 23rd dispatch】 A massive grain distribution struggle has been launched in Lingbao County, east of Tongguan. After expressing their grievances, the masses in Guolüe Township first distributed the grain of landlord Xu Daze on September 26. The next day, over 1,400 peasants launched a grain distribution struggle against the tyrant Chen Xichou. Following this, the masses in over 20 villages, including Dongche Village and Liu Village, successively rose up to struggle against landlords and local bullies. In the past ten days, the struggle has yielded over 20,000 jin of grain, two jin of gold, 80 silver ingots, and 30 rifles, providing the poor peasants and hired laborers with initial benefits. Peasant associations have been established in ten villages, producing 55 peasant leaders and developing over 3,600 peasant association members. On October 8, over 10,000 peasants from over ten villages, including Guolüe Township, Xiepo, and Liu Village, jointly struggled against the local bullies Xu Lao Ba, Xu Lao Wu, and Xu Jianjing. After the emancipated peasants entered the venue, they heavily surrounded the portrait of Chairman Mao. An old peasant in his fifties excitedly said, "This is our leader for emancipation." When the tyrants Xu Lao Wu, etc., were dragged into the venue, dozens of people, including Xu Kexin, Wang Sixian, and Yang Lao Tai, surrounded the tyrants and poured out their grievances. Xu Kexin complained: "Twenty-six years ago, you, Xu Lao Ba, said I was against you, detained me in the township office, fined me for building a wall seven zhang and seven chi long, and made me spend 400 yuan. I have been in debt ever since and have to pay 20 dan of wheat interest every year." Liu Qingquan also had tyrannical behavior, but he admitted his mistakes and repented to the masses, who showed him leniency.

　　灵宝陕县群众获得解放后
  　自动组织起来分粮分田
    【本报太岳二十三日电】豫西新解放区陕州会兴镇有五千余人参加分粮分田斗争，已从地主奸霸手中夺回土地一万七千余亩，房屋七十座，牲口八十余头及粮食等物。抗日时期，此地曾连遭水旱蝗汤（按指汤恩伯）四灾，近一年来又加蒋匪的横征暴敛，抽丁抓人，已逼得家家无粮，户户无地，村村无壮丁。当我军解放时，穷人无粮食吃要求分粮，但因散匪三三两两到处抢劫，群众一时不敢明白提出分粮要求。领导上即于九月底，一面发动群众捕捉散匪，一面领导分粮斗争，很快将散匪捕捉完，安定了革命秩序，就有八百余人参加了分粮斗争，但群众仍有顾虑，恐怕地主奸霸反攻，乃自动组织翻身武装。此时，群众马上活跃起来。侯村的宋老汉就自报奋勇的说：“我找天村的薛某去，他是穷人”。薛某除联络了天村的穷苦群众外，并带起河底刘拴常、四官村之吕常发等，也联络起本村的穷人来闹斗争，各村的穷人串通起来，约有男女五千余人，便进一步要求分配地主的土地，捉恶霸，造成大斗争。现该镇以东三十里，南北二十里地区内之十四个自然村，均成立了农会，领导贫雇进行分地分粮斗争。
    【本报太岳二十三日电】潼关东之灵宝县，已掀起巨大的分粮斗争。虢略镇经过诉苦后，首先于九月二十六日将地主许大则粮食分了，第二天又有一千四百余农民向奸霸陈锡筹展开分粮斗争，接着就有东车村、留村等二十余村群众纷纷起来向地主恶霸作斗争，十天来，斗争出粮食二万余斤，金子二斤，元宝八十个，步枪三十支，使贫雇初步得到了利益。又在十个村成立了农会，产生了五十五位农民领袖，发展农会会员三千六百余人。十月八日，虢略镇、斜坡、留村等十余村万余农民，又联合斗争恶霸许老八、许老五及许奸精等。当翻身农民进入会场后，重重围着毛主席的像，一位五十余岁的老农兴奋的说：“这就是咱们翻身的领袖，当把奸霸许老五等拉入会场时，许克信、王思贤、杨老太等数十人，一齐包围恶霸诉苦。许克信诉说：“二十六年你许老八说我反对你，把我扣到乡公所，罚我修了七丈七尺的墙，叫我化了四百元，我因此累下了债，每年出麦利二十石”。刘清泉也有恶霸行为，但其向群众认错悔过，群众宽大了他。
