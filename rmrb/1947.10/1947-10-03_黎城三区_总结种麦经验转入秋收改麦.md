　　Licheng Third District
  　Summarizing Wheat Planting Experience and Transitioning to Autumn Harvest and Wheat Improvement
    [This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] The intense period of wheat planting in the Third District has passed. Now, it has entered the stage of clearing up the remaining tasks of wheat planting and transitioning to autumn harvesting and wheat improvement. The following experiences have been obtained during the campaign: (1) Repeatedly rectify the management of landlords by mutual aid groups to increase the production enthusiasm of the peasants. For example, the landlord Li Hanlv in Qiushuyuan Village repaired the land for the peasants, only picking up small stones and not the big ones. When plowing the land, the peasants broke the plowshare. In villages such as Xiama’s Binlang Slope, landlords refused to lower their heads. Only through struggle and strict control did the wheat planting become vigorous. (2) Break the thinking of being afraid of being too early and waiting. For example, the cadres of villages such as Longwangmiao and Qiushuyuan said: "Our village has a hot climate and cannot be planted yet. It is not too late!" After research by various cadres and activists, it was proposed that in order to prevent the heavy task of supporting the front line during wheat planting and autumn harvest, it is better to plant early. Xiama Village put forward the slogan "Straighten the hedges early for good wheat" to overcome the thinking of not wanting to plant early and launched a wheat planting campaign. Dongchangyuan Village used to be a backward village in terms of harvesting and wheat planting. This year, it has a total of more than 1,400 mu of wheat land. According to the original plan of each group, it would take 13 days to complete. Under the active leadership of Cui Genfeng and Ma Sentang, the wheat planting was completed in ten days, saving three days. (3) Party members take the lead and heroes set an example. After discussion, the Qiushuyuan branch specifically assigned tasks to party members. One party member proposed the slogan "Plant early, harvest early, prevent drought and prepare for famine," which promoted his entire group to plant 40 mu of wheat in seven days. (4) Publicize victory, commend achievements and models, and encourage everyone's enthusiasm. When the villages received news of the great counter-offensive in the Xinhua News, they promptly broadcast it to the entire village so that everyone knew about the victory of our army's counter-offensive. Everyone rushed to complete wheat planting. Women in Qiushuyuan actively made shoes and sewed clothes for the militiamen. Zizhen created a "red star competition" to complete wheat planting ahead of schedule. After more than ten days of concentrated effort, the entire district has largely completed wheat planting and is transitioning to the autumn cultivation and wheat improvement campaign.

    [This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] The Qiushuyuan branch party members took the lead and completed wheat planting before the eighth day of the month. Now, each group has assigned work and formulated an autumn cultivation plan. Under the leadership of Li Chongqi, the Jiang Xiangyan group formulated an autumn cultivation plan combined with wheat improvement on the eighteenth of this month, and formulated methods for exchanging labor: land is assessed according to distance, labor and animal power are assigned tasks, and special personnel are selected to be responsible. Livestock are specifically managed for planting land and improving wheat during autumn cultivation, and labor is only responsible for harvesting. Unified labor is assessed according to the job, and Li Chongqi is selected as the appraiser and inspector. The entire group is divided into two types of work records for workers, and labor and animal power are used in a unified manner.

　　黎城三区
  　总结种麦经验转入秋收改麦
    【本报黎城讯】三区种麦紧张时间已过，现已进入扫清种麦尾巴，转向秋收改麦，运动中得出以下几点经验：（１）反复整顿互助管理地主，提高农民生产热情。如秋树垣村地主李汉驴给农民修地，光拾小石头不拾大的，耕地时农民把铧子打了。象下马家槟榔坡等村，均发生地主不低头的事实，经斗争管制突击种麦才起劲。（２）打破嫌早等待思想。如龙王庙，秋树垣等村干说：“我们村气候热，还种不的哩，不迟哩！”在各干部积极分子研究后，提出为了防止种麦秋收中支援前线任务繁重，还是早种树，下马家峪村提出口号早篱直麦，打通嫌早不愿种的思想，掀起种麦运动。象东长垣村是过去收耕种麦落后的村子，今年共麦地一千四百多亩，根据各组的原订计划十三天才能完成，在崔根凤、马森堂等积极带头下，起早搭黑十天完成种麦，省了三天。（３）党员带头英雄起模范，秋树垣支部经过讨论党员具体分工，某党员提出早种早收防旱备荒口号，推动他全组四十亩麦七天就种上。（４）宣传胜利表扬成绩、模范，鼓励大家情绪。各村接到新华报上的大反攻消息，及时广播到全村，使每个人都知道了我军的反攻胜利，大家都争先恐后的突击种麦，秋树垣妇女积极给民兵做鞋，缝衣，子镇为了提前完成种麦创造夺红星竞赛。全区经过十余天突击，大部完成种麦，转入收耕改麦运动。

    【本报黎城讯】秋树垣支部党员带头初八前即完成种麦，现在各组都分工订出秋耕计划，李崇奇领导下江祥彦组在本月十八号订出秋耕结合改麦计划，订出变工办法：地按远近临时评工，劳畜力分工作，各选专人负责，牲口在收耕中专管种地改麦，劳力光管收割。统一人工按活计工，选出李崇奇任评工检查员，全组分出工人工两种表，统一使用劳畜力。
