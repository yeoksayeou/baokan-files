Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 30th — The People's Armed Work Team, active in the Qing (Yuan), Tai (Yuan), and Xu (Gou) triangle area, fought bravely for ten months within the "Hundred-Li Defense Line" of Yan's bandits, where bunkers and roads were as dense as spider webs. They developed from holding small areas to recovering large liberated areas, restoring forty-two democratic village governments, and tying down two regular divisions of Yan's bandits (the 69th Division and the Engineering Division) and four security brigades. The Armed Work Team started with the struggle against "maintenance," organizing the masses to resist conscription and grain requisition. The bravery and resourcefulness of the team members made the Yan puppet personnel change color at the mention of them. On the eighth of June, in broad daylight, Yan's special agent Cao Tianliang ran to Wangguo Village (five li from Jinci) to collect grain. As soon as he sat down on the street, two armed soldiers came up to him and said, "Our battalion commander invites you." Cao Tianliang followed them out, and as he walked to the edge of the village, his hands were tied up by armed work team members in disguise.

On the seventh of July, at midnight, the special agent Zhao Bingkui, nicknamed "King of Hell," broke into the village office of a village in the Third District of Taiyuan, roaring to hand over grain under the light of a kerosene lamp. When the masses were forced to heartbreakingly rush to transport wheat, the sentry of the Armed Work Team suddenly appeared at the village office. The masses were overjoyed, but dared not laugh out loud. Zhao Bingkui was about to show off his power when, unexpectedly, two bayonets were aimed at his chest. He was immediately dumbfounded and surrendered. Hao Yuelin, the captain of the Taiyuan "Revenge Self-Defense Force," another heinous criminal, was also arrested by the Armed Work Team and executed after a public trial by the masses.

In the struggle, the masses' protection and guidance of the Armed Work Team in annihilating the enemy were particularly vivid and touching. On July 19, the Armed Work Team ran into a mute in a sorghum field in a village. They asked him, "Are there any enemy troops in the village?" The mute nodded and held up four fingers, showing a face full of anger, pointing to his mouth and making a digging gesture, and gesturing and miming cutting off heads. The Armed Work Team understood what he meant and immediately set up an ambush at the edge of the village. Sure enough, four Yan soldiers came out and were captured alive. The Armed Work Team also armed the village office with the captured weapons and established an explosives team with poor peasants and farmhands as the backbone. At the same time, they launched a mass political offensive, closely combining various forms of struggle with armed struggle, successively crushing ten enemy "encirclements and suppressions." In forty-one battles, the Armed Work Team captured seventeen strongholds, annihilated five hundred and fifteen enemies, captured four hundred and fifty enemies, seized ten light artillery pieces, four machine guns, and two hundred and thirteen rifles, rescued one hundred and fifty hostages, and recovered more than eighty-seven thousand jin of grain. In addition, five hundred and twenty-one Yan puppet personnel were disintegrated in the political offensive. Now the situation in the area has been completely opened up. Armed peasants are surrounding and isolating the Yan army in strongholds. Democratic order is well maintained in the vast recovered areas, and each village is launching land reform and movements to protect the land and participate in the war. The Qingtai Xu area is about sixty li from east to west and more than one hundred li from north to south. Its northern end directly threatens Taiyuan City. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was a guerrilla base area for the Eighth Route Army. From October to December last year, Yan's bandits established a "Hundred-Li Defense Line" centered on Taiyuan, using the highway and the edge of the Fen River to set up more than seventy strongholds, often using three regiments of troops to repeatedly "encircle and suppress" and colluding with local bullies and ruffians in each village to form "Revenge Teams," massacring more than three hundred people.

　　太原附近阎匪“百里防线”内
  　我武工队创建根据地
  　结合群众逼使阎伪陷于孤立
    【新华社晋绥三十日电】活跃于清（源）太（原）徐（沟）三角地区的人民武工队，在阎贼碉堡汽路密如蛛网的“百里防线”内，奋战十个月，从坚持小块阵地发展为收复大块解放区，恢复四十二个民主村政权，牵制阎匪两个正规师（六十九师及工兵师）和四个保安大队。武工队从反“维持”斗争着手，组织群众抗丁抗粮。队员的勇猛机智，使阎伪人员无不谈虎色变。六月八日白天，阎记特务曹天良跑到王郭村（距晋祠五里）要粮，刚在街上坐下，即有两名武装战士迎上来，口称：“我们营长请你哩。”曹天良跟着出来，当他走到村边两手就被化装的武工队员捆绑起来了。
    七月七日夜半外号“阎王”的特务赵炳奎闯进太原第三区某村村公所，坐在火油灯下吼着交粮。当群众被迫痛心地抢运麦子时，村公所突然出现武工队的门哨，群众喜得眉飞色舞，只是不敢笑出声来。赵炳奎正要耍威风，出乎意外地两柄刺刀已对准他的胸口，他顿时目瞪口吃，束手就擒。另一罪大恶极的太原“复仇自卫队”队长郝月林亦被武工队逮捕，并经群众公审处决。
    在斗争中，广大群众掩护和向导武工队的歼敌事迹，尤为生动感人。七月十九日武工队在某村青纱帐里碰上一位哑吧，问他“村里有没有敌军。”哑子点头伸出四个手指，又显出满面怒容，指嘴作打挖手势，并指手划脚作砍头模样，武工队领会了他的意思，立即到村边设伏，果然有四名阎军出来，当将活捉。武工队并以缴获的武器武装村公所，成立以贫雇为骨干的爆炸组，同时发动群众性的政治攻势、使各种斗争形式密切结合武装斗争，先后粉碎敌十次“清剿”，在四十一次战斗中，武工队共攻克据点十七处，歼敌五百十五名，俘敌四百五十名，缴获轻炮十门、机枪四挺、步枪二百十三支，救出肉票一百五十名，夺回粮食八万七千余斤。另在政治攻势中瓦解阎伪人员五百二十一名。现在该地局面已完全打开，武装农民团团团退缩孤立据点的阎军，广大收复区内民主秩序井然，各村正发动土地改革和保田参战运动。按清太徐地区东西约六十里、南北约一百余里，其北端直接威胁太原市，抗战时期为八路军游击根据地，去年十月至十二月阎贼以太原为中心建立“百里防线”，利用公路线与汾河地边设立据点七十余处，经常以三个团兵力反复“清剿”，并在各村纠合恶霸流氓组成“复仇队”，惨杀群众三百余人。
