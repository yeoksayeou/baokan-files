Taihang First Administrative Office's Three Check-ups:
　　Conscientiously Solve Ideological Problems
　　Secretary Wang Gang and others Expelled from the Party for Embezzlement and Dereliction of Duty
[Reported by this newspaper] The Three Check-ups study of the Taihang First Administrative Office has provisionally concluded after twenty-six days of movement. During the study period, with the exception of a few comrades who remained to maintain daily work, all cadres and miscellaneous personnel were involved in the movement. In the beginning, some comrades from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds felt that they supported the policies and were willing to boldly mobilize the masses, and that their ideology was not a problem. However, after concrete introspection, they realized that there were problems with their ideology and stance. For example, some comrades, whenever the masses rose up, would "fear landlords running away" and "fear social (??) turmoil," exhibiting right-leaning emotions that suppressed the mass movement. Some comrades re-evaluated their class background. Poor cadres and miscellaneous personnel, after speaking out about their sufferings and being mobilized, also clarified where their pain came from, and their level of awareness improved somewhat. Based on the investigation of ideology, Wang Gang (Administrative Office Secretary) and Zhao Zihou (Administrative Office Construction Section Clerk), who had consistently defended the interests of landlords, shielded landlords, and engaged in embezzlement and dereliction of duty, were expelled from the Party. As ideological problems were initially exposed and resolved, and specific issues were dealt with, the righteous atmosphere of the organization was promoted. Comrades who had consistently worked hard were commended, while some comrades with poor work styles and inconsistent words and actions were subjected to mass criticism. Most comrades resolved to be good servants to the masses and vowed not to "muddle through the revolution" any longer.

In terms of leadership methods in this Three Check-ups movement, in addition to consistently promoting free thinking and conscientiously and focusedly solving ideological problems from beginning to end, only two points of experience are put forward regarding the study situation: (1) The Three Check-ups study must involve all personnel (especially miscellaneous personnel from poor backgrounds). We must value their opinions and vigorously help and mobilize them. Although their literacy level is low, they possess a natural, pure class essence and are quite correct in their understanding of certain issues. This is not only beneficial to miscellaneous personnel but also has a considerable impact on the entire study and work, especially in upper-level organizations where there are few cadres from poor backgrounds and a large number of miscellaneous personnel. (2) The Three Check-ups study itself includes two aspects: solving the widespread ideological problems (which is fundamental) and handling specific individual problems (based on the aforementioned ideological foundation). These two cannot be completely separated. The Administrative Office took some detours on this issue. Facts have proven that as long as specific individual problems are solved on the basis of the ideological awareness of the majority, it will not only not affect the resolution of widespread ideological problems but will instead promote the movement to move forward.

　　太行一专三查中
  　认真解决思想问题
  　秘书王刚等贪污渎职开除政籍
    【本报讯】太行一专署的三查学习，经过二十六天的运动，已暂告一段落。学习期间，除留少数同志坚持日常工作外，全体干部杂务人员，全数卷入运动。开始，一些地主富农出身的同志，都感到自己拥护政策，又愿放手发动群众，思想没有啥问题，经具体反省后，才知自己思想、立场都有问题，如有些同志每当群众起来时，即“怕地主跑”、“怕社会（？）动荡不安”等，表现压抑群众运动的右倾情绪，有些同志对自己阶级成份，重新作了认识；贫苦干杂人员，经过诉苦发动，也明确了自己的痛苦是从那来的，觉悟程度有些提高。在查思想的基础上，把一贯维护地主利益、包庇地主、贪污渎职的王刚（专秘书）、赵子厚（专建设科员）开除政籍。由于思想问题初步暴露与解决，和具体问题的处理，机关正气伸张，一贯埋头苦干的同志，得到了表扬，而一些作风不良，言行不一致的同志，却遭到群众性的指责，大部同志决心要给群众当个好勤务员，不应也不能再“混革命”了。
    这次三查运动，在领导方法上，除从头到尾贯澈发挥自由思想、认真的和有重点的解决思想外，仅就学习情况，提出两点经验：（一）三查学习必须把所有人员（特别是贫苦出身的杂务人员）卷入运动，我们要重视宝贵他们的意见，要大力帮助发动他们，他们文水平虽低，但却具有本然的纯朴的阶级本质，在某些问题的认识上是相当正确的，这不仅对杂务人员有好处，且对整个学习和工作，也有他相当大的作用，特别是上层机关贫苦出身干部少，杂务人员数量又多的情况下作用更大。（二）三查学习本身即包括两方面内容：解决普遍存在的思想问题（这是基本的），与处理具体个别问题（在前一思想基础上）二者不能截然划开。专署在这个问题上是走了些弯路。事实证明，只要在多数思想觉悟基础上，解决个别具体问题，不但不会影响普遍思想问题的解决，相反的会促进运动前进一步。（雁怀）
