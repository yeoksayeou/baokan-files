　　【This Newspaper News】Since the counter-offensive, the Border Region Postal Administration has called on all bureaus and stations in the region to mobilize urgently, work selflessly, leverage the effectiveness of the People's Post, and vigorously cooperate with the national counter-offensive. In addition to responding to the instructions of the Central Propaganda Department to quickly resolve river and rain obstacles, further improve rural postal services, and create more "flying legs" and "flying cars" to speed up the delivery of newspapers and mail day and night, all bureaus and stations in the region are now launching a movement to improve technology and eliminate errors, create "technical experts," and cultivate "model technical units," requiring them to do things correctly, quickly, and well: First, be familiar with the three major businesses of registration, parcels, and remittances, and eliminate substandard phenomena. Second, improve the accounting system, calculate accurately, and save financial and material resources to support the front line. Third, improve the sealing and dispatching technology to reduce undeliverable mail, and achieve fast receipt, few returns, correct dispatch, and clear delivery, requiring no loss, no wrong dispatch, no damage, and no backlog of any mail, and promptly and accurately deliver the news of victory at the front and liberation in the rear to the recipients, to boost morale and inspire the people. Fourth, strictly trace and check to clarify responsibilities and overcome errors, and complete business archives and procedures. Fifth, improve the technology of using date stamps, postal scales, vehicles, etc., to ensure that mail is "fast" and "accurate." In early September, Taihang has launched a friendly competition with the Taiyue and Southern Hebei regions, determined to improve technology. County bureaus and stations have also responded one after another, challenging each other, encouraging each other, helping each other, checking each other, and learning from each other, creating a surge of enthusiasm. Bureau chiefs and section chiefs from the Southern Hebei region have also gone down to inspect and help, on the one hand, promoting creativity and improving technology, and on the other hand, carrying out mass inspections, overthrowing carelessness, and thoroughly eliminating errors.

　　【This Newspaper Jinlu豫 Dispatch on the 4th】The Jinlu豫 Postal Administration is supporting the full-scale counter-offensive with practical actions, implementing rapid movement, and calling on all postal workers in the region to mobilize urgently to complete four tasks: (1) Further implement rapid movement, with priority to trunk lines and newspapers, trying every means to overcome the difficulties of the rainy season, and restoring night shifts where possible, so that newspapers and mail do not stay for a minute, because one minute earlier will increase the political effect by one point. (2) The task of local post offices is to obey the military postal task. Wherever the troops are stationed, the local post office must take the initiative to contact the military post office, because supporting the great counter-offensive requires delivering the troops' postal newspapers faster and more timely. (3) Collect read newspapers in a planned and organized manner and post them in the guerrilla areas and newly liberated areas to spread the news of victory quickly. (4) Help village organizations with the autumn harvest and wheat planting. In order to complete the above tasks, each bureau and station must carry out a class investigation and position investigation movement to improve the quick mail meritorious service movement.
　　Also reported: The Propaganda Department of the Regional Party Committee, in recognition of the hard work of all postal employees, which has achieved great results, has sent a letter to commend them, pointing out that they have firmly grasped the working spirit of "fast" and "accurate," universally implemented night shifts, worked through wind and rain, overcome various difficulties, and ensured the regular connection of postal work north and south of the Yellow River. The transmission of newspapers and documents has been one or several times faster than usual, greatly improving the credibility of the post office among the masses.
