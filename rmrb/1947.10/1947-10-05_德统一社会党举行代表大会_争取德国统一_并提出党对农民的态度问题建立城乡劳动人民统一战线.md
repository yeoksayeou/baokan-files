Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. A comprehensive report: The Second National Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED, formed by the merger of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany) was held in Berlin on September 21st and concluded successfully on the 24th. This congress determined the party's policy, primarily to strive for the unification of Germany as a whole.

The congress first heard the political report made by Party Chairman Wilhelm Pieck on behalf of the Party Central Committee. Pieck began by stating that since the party's founding in the spring of 1946, it had been striving to secure peace, democracy, and prosperity for the German people, to establish friendly relations with other countries, and to guarantee Germany's path towards socialism. Pieck said: "The development of the Socialist Unity Party in the Soviet occupation zone and the results of its work fully prove that the workers' movement must be united under the leadership of a socialist program. And the unity of the workers is the guarantee for the complete realization of the party's tasks." The report condemned the divisive activities of Kurt Schumacher, leader of the German Social Democratic Party, in undermining the united front of German workers. He continued: "Due to the so-called Marshall Plan, the work of transferring large enterprises and concerns into the hands of the people in Berlin and the British and American occupation zones has been seriously jeopardized." He also stated: "The division of the working class can only allow bourgeois parties to win."

Central Committee member Gfoerer's report on the party's organizational work pointed out that in the seventeen months since the party's founding, membership had increased by 38 percent, now reaching 1.9 million. Adding the 324,000 Communist Party members in the western occupation zones, as well as the thousands of Social Democratic Party members and non-party members who support unity, the party's Second Congress represented 2.25 million progressive Germans, with workers accounting for 48 percent of the membership.

On the third day of the congress, Chairman Grotewohl reported on the struggle for German national unification and democratization, and specifically raised the question of the party's attitude towards peasants. Grotewohl called for the establishment of a united front of working people in towns and villages.

At the fourth day's meeting, party vice-chairman Ulbricht reported on democratic reforms in the economic and administrative fields. The report paid great attention to the status of workers. Ulbricht strongly stated that the position of workers in the economy of the Soviet occupation zone had undergone fundamental changes, with most of the largest industries having been nationalized, trade unions having decisive opinions, and a system of mass management having been widely implemented. The exploitation of workers in private enterprises has been limited by law and democratic authorities. Considerable success has also been achieved in eliminating unemployment. Therefore, the workers' attitude towards production has undergone a significant change. Ulbricht strongly stated that in the past two years, the foundations for construction have been laid in the Soviet occupation zone, the basis for a new democratic order has been established, and rational economic planning has begun.

The above reports, after heated debate at the congress, showed the party's consistent principles. On the 24th, the congress passed several resolutions. When Grotewohl declared in his closing speech that "on the question of the unification of Germany as a whole, the Socialist Unity Party will never retreat a step from its position," the congress immediately erupted in a storm of applause.

After passing a letter to the German people, the congress unanimously elected Pieck and Grotewohl as the party's chairmen. In his acceptance speech, Pieck said that the salient feature of the congress was the awakening of the party's emotional excitement for international solidarity. Delegations from the labor parties of ten countries (including the delegation of the All-Union Communist Party) attended the congress. The Second Congress has established a practical foundation for the solidarity between the Socialist Unity Party and the socialist parties of various European countries.

　　德统一社会党举行代表大会
  　争取德国统一
  　并提出党对农民的态度问题建立城乡劳动人民统一战线
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合报导：德国统一社会党（德境苏占领区共产党与社会民主党合并而成）第二次全国代表大会，于九月二十一日在柏林举行，已于二十四日胜利闭幕。此次大会确定了党的政策，首在争取德国全国的统一。
    大会首先听取党主席皮克代表该党中央局所作的政治报告。皮克首称：党于一九四六年春季成立时起，即为德国人民获取和平、民主与繁荣，以及与其他国家建立友好关系，并保证为德国走向社会主义而斗争。皮克称：“统一社会党在苏占区的发展，及其党工作的成果，完满地证明了：必须在社会主义的纲领领导之下团结工人运动。而工人的团结，正是党的任务之完全实现的保证。”报告斥责德国社会民主党领袖舒马赫破坏德国工人统一阵线的分裂活动。继称：“由于所谓马歇尔计划，柏林及英美占区将大企业及康采仑转到人民手中的工作，受到严重的危害。”并称：“工人阶级的分裂，仅能使资产阶级政党获胜。”
    中央局委员格佛关于党的组织工作之报告指出：党成立以来十七个月中，党员已增加了百分之三十八，现已达一百九十万人。如加上西部占领区的三十二万四千名共产党员，以及支持团结的数千名社会民主党党员和非党人士，则党的二次大会代表了二百二十五万进步的德国人，党员中工人的成份占百分之四十八。
    大会第三天，由大会主席格鲁提渥报告德国全国统一及民主化的奋斗情况，并特别提出党对农民的态度问题。格氏要求建立城镇与乡村劳动人民的统一战线。
    第四日会议上，党的副主席吴布里希报告经济与行政方面的民主改革。报告中关于工人地位问题曾受到极大注意。吴氏力称：苏占区工人在经济中的地位已发生了根本变化，多数最大的工业已收归国有，工会具有决定性的意见与大众管理的制度业已广泛实现。私营企业中对工人的剥削已为法律与民主当局所限制。消灭失业也有相当成就。因此工人对生产的态度发生了显著的变化。吴氏力称：两年来苏占区已奠定了建设的始基，新民主秩序之基础业已奠定，合理的经济计划业已开始。
    上述各报告经大会热烈辩论结果，显示党内原则的一致。二十四日大会通过若干议案。当格鲁提渥在闭幕词中宣称“对于德国全国的统一的问题，统一社会党绝不在它的阵地中退让一步”时，大会立时腾起一阵风暴般的喝采。
    大会于通过告德国人民书后，全体一致选出皮克及格鲁提渥为党的主席。皮克当选后，即席演说称：大会显著的特点，是党内对国际团结的兴奋情感的觉醒。出席大会的有十个国家劳工政党的代表团（包括联共代表团）。第二次大会已为统一社会党与欧洲各国社会党之间的团结树立了实际的基础。
