Continue Digging Ditches to Divert Water and Strive to Plant More Wheat

[Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 7th] This year, at the beginning of the rainy season, the Renping County government, in view of the annual flooding of land on both sides of the Pu-Ji River in the eighth and ninth districts, decided that each district should dig ditches to divert water and increase production. The eighth district mobilized 4,000 laborers before the heavy rain, digging 79 ditches, ranging from one to three feet deep, with a total length of 2,700 *zhang* [approximately 8,910 meters], saving 1,600 *mu* [approximately 106.7 hectares] of land. During the heavy rain, cadres from the first and seventh districts took the lead in leading the masses to dig ditches and divert water day and night, braving the rain. The accumulated water in Dongguan was two feet deep, but after digging the ditch, the water immediately receded, and as a result, more than 100 *mu* of land was not flooded. According to the county's summary, a total of 62,473 *mu* of land was flooded this autumn. 105 ditches were dug, saving 23,342 *mu* of land, which can increase autumn grain harvest by more than 2,300 *shi* [approximately 230,000 kg]. Among the flooded land, 91 percent of the land was able to be planted with wheat after the water was diverted. As for the remaining 5,827 *mu* of land, it was decided to continue digging ditches to divert water. The losses suffered by the flooded land will be compensated by an appropriate amount from the harvest of the saved land. The county secretary called on the meeting to continue resolutely diverting water, striving to plant wheat on as much of the flooded land as possible. Planting one more *mu* will increase the counter-offensive power by one point. He called for rescuing the dead low-lying land and planting wheat there, digging deep trenches around the water's edge in the dead low-lying land, and diverting the water in the depression into the deep trenches, striving to rescue all the existing 5,827 *mu* of flooded land. At present, all districts are working hard separately to continue diverting water.

  　继续挖沟顺水争取多种麦子
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】今年雨季初来时，荏平县府鉴于八、九区普及河两岸年年淹地，乃决定各区挖沟顺水增加生产。八区在大雨前就动员了四千民工，挖沟七十九道，深一尺至三尺，共长二千七百丈，救出地一千六百亩。大雨时，一、七区干部带头率领群众，星夜冒雨挖沟顺水，东关积水二尺，经挖沟后，水马上落下去了，结果一百多亩地都没淹着。全县总结，今秋共淹地六万两千四百七十三亩，挖沟一○五道，救出地二万三千三百四十二亩，能增收秋粮二千三百余石；被淹地中，因顺水后地干能种麦的占被淹地百分之九十一，其余五千八百二十七亩地，决定继续挖沟顺水，被淹地所受损失，由被救地的收成中，酌量提出若干补偿。县书在会上号召，继续坚决顺水，争取使水淹地尽量都能种上麦子，多种一亩就能多增加一分反攻力量。号召把死洼地也救出来种麦，在死洼地周围贴水边挖深壕，把洼里的水顺至深壕中，争取把现有的五千八百二十七亩水淹地，全部救出来，现各区正分头努力，继续顺水。
