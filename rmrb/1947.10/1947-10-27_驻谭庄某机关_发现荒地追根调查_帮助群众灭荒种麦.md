[This report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 25th] After most of the land in Tanzhuang, the fifth district of Nanfeng, had been sown with wheat, a certain organ stationed in the village recently discovered three more plots of unplowed wasteland south of the village. An investigation revealed the following: (1) A plot of wasteland west of the cypress grove south of the village, measuring twelve mu, was covered with creeping vines and swollen knotweed-like weeds. Children often grazed sheep there. The ground was moldy, appearing gray-brown, with yellow-green fungal plants the size of dung pellets. The masses said that this land belonged to the landlord Zhu Guangbi of Zhuzhuang. To avoid being targeted, the landlord had dispersed this land to a private school teacher from another village, using it to pay for his children's tuition. The land was rented to Zhu Pili for farming. It hadn't been fertilized in three or four years. This spring, when the land reform took place, the landlord Zhu Guangbi was struggled against, and the private school teacher returned home. As a result, no one took care of this land, and no autumn crops were sown, causing the land to become barren. Because the soil wasn't fertile, it needed proper fertilization, and the masses were unwilling to take it when the land was divided, fearing that they would waste the seeds and still have to pay public grain. (2) A plot of wasteland due south of the village, estimated at ten mu, belonged to a landlord in Wangzhuang to the west. The person in charge of that landlord's household had been on the run for a long time. The land also hadn't been properly fertilized and was very poor. According to the people of Tanzhuang, "It was allocated to Meizhongji. Late corn was sown, but since sowing, no weeding had been done. The weeds ate the seedlings. The corn stalks grew only a foot tall, and not a single grain was seen." When inquired in the market, the village instructor said, "This land was allocated by the old village chief. Now he has been transferred to another job, and I am not clear." After asking the masses, nothing was found out. Later, the instructor said, "It was probably allocated to Dongmeizhong." When asked in Dongmeizhong, the village cadres hesitated and said, "It was allocated to Litai." Then they went to Litai to ask, and the chairman of the peasant association said, "This land was originally allocated to Dongmeizhong, but they thought it was too far and the land was poor, so they didn't sow it. A few days ago, Comrade Qu Gan said it could be given to our village to sow, but nothing is certain yet." (3) A plot slightly to the west, 141 steps long and 20 steps wide, also belonged to a landlord in Wangzhuang and was allocated to Dongmeizhong. Poor peasant Tian Jinbao was allocated four mu, which was four li from the village and too far to farm. The remaining several mu have not yet been allocated. Tian Jinbao has repeatedly expressed his opinion, willing to make an adjustment and exchange it for a plot closer by, but this has not been resolved. The organ is currently discussing the matter with district cadres, village cadres, and the masses to help the masses sow wheat before the beginning of winter, jointly responding to the district party committee's call to "sow wheat extensively to eliminate wasteland" and increase production to support the front lines.

[This report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 25th] Regarding the issue of sowing wheat on wasteland, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily published a short commentary, stating that due to insufficient attention in the past, eliminating wasteland remains an important issue. In Tanzhuang village, Nanfeng alone, there are more than 50 mu of wasteland. A village peasant association director said, regarding the situation in nearby villages, "Almost every village has wasteland, ranging from 10 to 8 mu to 30 to 40 mu, and even more than one qing." Comrade Liu, secretary of the fifth district committee of Nanfeng, said that according to what he knows, the district has about seven or eight qing of wasteland. Based on the inspection of several villages, wasteland exists for the following reasons: (1) Most of it was not distributed to the masses during the land reform. Some was nominally farmed by the peasant association, but it wasn't properly cultivated. (2) The land allocated to poor peasants was too far away to farm. (3) Village cadres occupied too much land and couldn't farm it all. (4) Families who went to the Northeast during the famine haven't returned, and although someone is farming their land, it's mostly semi-abandoned. (5) Landlords are inherently lazy and don't cultivate the land allocated to them properly.

In leading the elimination of wasteland and sowing of wheat, some areas have achieved great success, but in other areas, cadres have not emphasized this issue during wheat sowing, causing village cadres to be afraid of facing the wasteland problem. Once, a village cadre, when asked about the wasteland in his village, dared not admit it. Only when the directive from the higher authorities this year to "not leave a single mu barren" was discussed with him, and the significance of sowing wheat extensively this year was explained, did he reveal the wasteland in the village and express his intention to pay attention to leading the elimination of wasteland and sowing of wheat. Therefore, it is hoped that counties and districts will vigorously call for action, help the masses solve some problems, and supervise them. Eliminating wasteland is not a difficult task. There are still more than ten days before the beginning of winter. As the saying goes, "Wheat doesn't survive past the beginning of winter, barley doesn't survive past the New Year." Now that most of the land in the villages has been sown with wheat, the livestock is idle, and people are not as busy as before. This is the time to organize forces well, expand the area sown with wheat, and eliminate wasteland.

    驻谭庄某机关
    发现荒地追根调查
    帮助群众灭荒种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】南峰五区谭庄的地，大部耩上麦子后，驻村某机关，近来又发现村南尚有三块没有犁耙的荒地，经调查情况如下：（一）南地柏树林西边一块荒地，十二亩，地里长满了爬地秧和肿眼科一类荒草，小孩子常常到那里放羊，地面上发了霉，呈现灰褐色，并有粪粒样大小黄绿的菌类植物。群众说这块地是朱庄地主朱光弼的，地主为了避免目标，把这块地分散给了外村一个教私塾的先生，并以此顶他小孩的学钱。这地经那私塾先生租给朱丕利种着，三抖四年没上过粪了，今春土改时，地主朱光弼被斗争，私塾先生回家了，这块地便没有人问事，秋苗没耩，地便荒起来了，因地不壮，必须好好上肥料，分地时群众都不愿意要，恐怕种上了白丢种籽，又得负担公粮。（二）村正南的一块荒地，约计十亩，是西边王庄地主的地。那家地主的主事人逃亡很久了，地里也是一直没有好好上粪，地很薄。据谭庄老百姓说：“分给妹冢集了，耩的晚棒子，自从播了种以后，一直没有锄草；草把苗子吃了，棒子杆长尺把高，一个粮食粒也没有见。”到集上打听，村指导员说：“这是经老村长分配的地，现在他调出去工作了，自己不清楚。”问了问群众，也没有打听出来，后来那指导员说：“大概分给东妹冢了”，到东妹冢去问，村干支支吾吾的说：“分给李台了，”接着又跑到李台去问，农会主席说：“这块地本是分给了东妹冢，他们嫌地远地薄，没有种，前几天区干某同志说给了俺村里种，现在还没说一定。”（三）偏西的一块长一百四十一步、宽二十步，也是王庄地主的地，分给东妹冢了，贫农田进宝分了四亩，离村有四里来地，路太远没法种，其余地几亩，现在还没有分下去，田进宝屡次反映意见，愿意调剂一下，换块近地，现在还没有解决。该机关正与区干及各村村干和群众讨论处理，争取在立冬以前帮助群众把麦种上，共同响应区党委“大量种麦消灭荒地”的号召，增加生产支援前线。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】关于荒地种麦问题，冀鲁豫日报特发表短论略称，过去由于注意不够，目前消灭荒地还是一个重要问题。仅南峰谭庄一个村，即有五十多亩荒地，某村农会主任谈他们附近村庄的情形说：“荒地差不多各村都有，从十亩八亩到三、四十亩，甚至还有在一顷以上的。”南峰五区区委书记刘同志谈，据他知道的计算了一下，全区荒地约有七、八顷。就几个村的检查，荒地有以下几种原因：（一）多半是土改中没有分到群众手里，有的名义上是农会伙种，其实也没有好好的耕作；（二）贫农分的地远，没办法种；（三）村干部多占的土地，种不过来，（四）灾荒时下关东没有回来的人家，地虽有人种着，也多是半荒着；（五）地主懒惰成性，群众分给他的地不去好好种。
    在领导灭荒种麦上，有的地区作的很有成绩，可是有的地区干部在种麦中没有强调提出这一问题，致使村干也怕正视荒地问题。曾见到一个村干部，当别人问起他村荒地时，不敢承认，当把今年上级号召“不荒一亩地”的指示给他谈了，解释今年大量种麦的意义，才谈出了该村的荒地，并表示要注意领导灭荒种麦。因此希望县区大力号召，并帮助群众解决一些问题，再加以督促，消灭荒地不是怎样困难的事。目前离立冬还有十多天，俗话说：“小麦不过冬（立冬），大麦不过年。”现在村里大部分的地都耩上麦了，牲口是得闲了，人也不象以前那样忙，这时应当很好组织一下力量，扩大种麦面积消灭荒地。
