　　Checking to See if Everyone Has Planted Enough?
  　Six Administrative Villages in Xiwu Implement Mutual Inspection

　　[Report from this newspaper, Licheng] Thirty-six cadres, heroes, and activists from the six base point administrative villages in Xiwu, on the morning of October 13th, conducted mutual inspections of autumn harvesting and wheat planting work between villages. After separate inspections, they gathered in Xiwu in the morning to conduct inspection summaries. Zhang Guangsheng, a labor hero from Kengnan, said: "Xiwu has great enthusiasm for work and is doing things quickly. Our village and Xiwu are neighboring villages. Our village was only cutting grain in the fields, and we saw that Xiwu had already cut it down, with livestock plowing the stubble and planting wheat in the fields one after another. In particular, they start early and work late, organizing night work teams, with people threshing grain, freeing up livestock to specialize in plowing the fields for wheat. They are doing a good job. For example, the team of labor hero Sun Aiting pulled 21 mu of grain with livestock and people hauling the loads in one night. They don't use a single animal for threshing, it's all done by people pulling rollers. They have now planted 36 mu of wheat. We should learn from them in plowing the fields, but the team in South Street doesn't have much enthusiasm, and women haven't been mobilized in time to open up equal value.” Song Shuangxian, the village chief of Xiwu, said: "Xishuiyang makes the wheat planting even and skillful, and they pay attention to technique when pruning cotton. Now the flowers are blooming white all over the ground. The whole village has organized all the women and has picked back tens of thousands of catties of cotton, but the wheat field plowing is not being done tightly enough, and the livestock are still being used to transport threshing as in the past, which affects the wheat field plowing." Yuan Zhong'an, an activist, said: "Dongshuiyang organized women to go to the fields to cut grain and pick cotton, and old men to go to the fields to hold the plow and smooth the wheat. They are harvesting quickly, and dry grass has already been bundled up in the fields. A lot of wheat has already been planted, but there are two elderly, poor, and widowed men who only planted a little over one mu of wheat because they don't have livestock or manpower." According to everyone's inspection summary, two serious problems were discovered: First, the disaster is serious, and the harvest is poor. The whole base point originally estimated a 70% harvest, but now it is less than 60%. There are more than a hundred mu of late grain and sixty mu of stubble beans that may not be harvested. Second, the peasants who have turned over, poor hired laborers, and widowed farmers who lack labor and livestock have planted less wheat. For example, two poor hired old men from Dongshuiyang, Mou Pang, and Shen Niu, have only planted one mu of wheat. Wang Baoquan from Xiwu, because he is sick in bed, has only planted two mu of wheat. After everyone's inspection, it was finally decided that the entire base point should plant another 500 mu of wheat, and return to the village to truly inspect and solve the difficulties of the poor hired laborers and peasants who have turned over, and tell them to plant more wheat to make up for this autumn's poor harvest.

　　看看是不是人人都种够了？
  　西仵六个行政村实行对调大检查
    【本报黎城讯】西仵基点六个行政村干部、英雄、积极分子卅六人，于十月十三日一早进行村与村对调检查收耕改麦工作，经过分头检查，上午集会西仵，进行检查总结，坑南劳英张光胜说：“西仵工作劲头大，搞的快，我村和西仵是邻村，我村才在地里割谷，看见西仵已经割倒，牲口一犋一犋的都在地里垡茬、改麦，特别是起早搭黑，组织夜工队，人打场，腾出牲口专门改麦垡地，做的好。如劳英孙爱廷组，一黑夜牲口拉人担谷二十一亩，打场不用一个牲口，完全是人拉滚，现在已改麦三十六亩，垡地我们应学习他，但就是南街那个队劲头不大，妇女没有及时开了等价。”西仵村长宋双贤说：“西水洋使＠溜栽麦，技术好，修理棉花注意技术。现在花都是开的雪白满地，全村组织所有妇女，已摘回了万数斤花，但改麦垡地抓的不紧，牲口仍照过去那样运驮打场，影响了改麦垡地。”积极分子原中安说：“东水洋组织了妇女上地割谷摘花，老汉上地掌犁溜麦，收的快，场上已捆起了干草，改麦已不少，就是有两个孤寡贫苦老汉，因没牲口人力，改麦才有一亩多。”根据大家的检查总结，发现两个严重问题：一、灾荒严重，年成歉收，全基点原估计七成年景，现在还不到六成年景，有百十余亩晚谷，六十来亩长茬豆恐没有收成。二、翻身贫雇孤寡没劳畜力的农民，改麦少，如东水洋、牟胖、申牛两个贫雇老汉，才改麦一亩，西仵王保全，因生病躺在炕上，才只改了二亩来麦。经过大家检查，最后讨论定出全基点要再改麦五百亩，并回村确实检查解决贫雇翻身农民困难，叫他们多改麦，以补今秋之歉收。
