　　Joint Directive of the Taiyue Administrative Office and Military Region:
  　Emphasize Leadership in Autumn Plowing
    [Our newspaper, Taiyue, 16th dispatch] The Taiyue Administrative Office and Military Region issued a joint appeal to governments, organs, and troops at all levels on the 12th, calling for meritorious service in autumn plowing. Currently, our region is vigorously carrying out autumn plowing and autumn planting. After the autumn harvest, autumn plowing will follow, which is the foundation for next year's spring plowing and sowing. It is a major prerequisite for preventing spring drought, increasing production, and ensuring the supply of materials for the great counteroffensive. Therefore, seizing the time to carry out autumn plowing is the primary task of the winter production plan. To implement this task, the following appeals are made: First, we must mobilize all levels of leaders and cadres ideologically, emphasize autumn plowing, recognize the importance of autumn plowing and its relationship to the counteroffensive, thereby breaking the masses' worries, overcoming fatigue, and leading the masses to organize autumn plowing, turning the slogan of autumn plowing into mass action; Second, launch a meritorious autumn plowing campaign. Cadres should take the lead and personally get involved, organizing all male and female full and semi-laborers, with cattle as the center to organize mutual assistance, and formulate specific measures. Those with good results will be rewarded. Learn from Zhao Meiying in Fushan, who uses apprentices to teach apprentices and has taught more than 90 women how to plow; Learn from Wangjiayuan in Qinyuan, who organized all full and semi-laborers to carry out autumn harvest and autumn plowing, setting a good example; Third, the autumn fields of military and cadre family members, families of revolutionary martyrs, retired soldiers, and families of militiamen and laborers participating in the war must be guaranteed to be plowed. However, those who have labor power should learn from Zhao Yaocheng, a martyr's family member in Jincheng, who declined preferential treatment and helped those without labor power to carry out autumn plowing, in order to overcome the difficulties of labor and livestock; Fourth, during the autumn plowing period, governments, troops, organs, groups, and schools at all levels should extract as much manpower and livestock as possible to help the local masses with autumn plowing without compensation, in order to promote the masses and solve some labor difficulties. Cadres at all levels, especially comrades who lead production work and labor heroes, you must carry forward the exemplary actions in spring plowing, wheat sowing, and autumn harvest, and lead the masses to carry out autumn plowing, "Don't be afraid of lack of labor, as long as you organize well." The Cold Dew has passed, and the Frost's Descent is approaching, we should immediately take action and strive to increase production and enrich the glorious task of the material foundation for the great counteroffensive.
