Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 13th: The famous Chinese educator and member of the CPC Central Committee, Comrade Xu Teli, specially published an article entitled "Remembering the Xinhai Revolution Today" on the 36th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. The original text is as follows:

　　The Xinhai Revolution was thirty-six years ago. Recalling the situation at that time, especially the situation in my province of Hunan, the lessons that can be drawn today are briefly described on the left:

　　The Wuchang Uprising was on October 10th, and Hunan responded on October 19th. The leaders of the uprising in Hunan were Jiao Dafeng and Chen Zuoxin. They were commoner leaders in the secret societies under the leadership of the Tongmenghui. At that time, the gentry class in Changsha City, especially the persons in charge of the education sector, were unwilling to be led by commoner leaders. They immediately supported Tan Yankai, a member of the constitutional monarchy faction, to organize the government. Jiao and Chen were busy assisting the Wuchang uprising army, and the political power fell into the hands of the constitutional monarchy faction. After the revolutionary army went to Wuchang, Tan's military officers carried out counter-revolutionary riots in the rear. Jiao and Chen were killed. From then on, the revolutionary flag of Hunan was taken away by the counter-revolutionaries in only nine days, and the revolutionary leaders were killed by the counter-revolutionaries. On the day of the revolution, the slogan put forward by Jiao and Chen was "Revolution to overthrow the Manchus," while the slogan put forward by Tan Yankai was "Maintain order and preserve security." The vast majority of revolutionary comrades believed that the fall of the Manchu officials meant the success of the revolution. The local gentry naturally advocated maintaining local order and preserving local security, not knowing that the revolution was to destroy the old order and disrupt the old security. Due to the ideological confusion of the revolutionary faction, they failed to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, between the gentry and the people, and regarded the enemy as friends. Not only Hunan was like this, but all provinces were the same. For example, the Wuchang Uprising was led by junior officers. The junior officers who rose up did not seize military and political power themselves, but supported Li Yuanhong, a senior military officer who feared the revolution, as the governor. They did not support their own comrades, but supported their superiors. As a result of the vague class consciousness, they recognized the thief as their father.

　　Before the Xinhai Revolution, the democratic republican faction and the constitutional monarchy faction were engaged in a sharp struggle. The Tongmenghui opposed the Manchu Qing and also opposed the constitutional monarchy faction. Because there was no survival without struggle. Therefore, in the first six years of the Tongmenghui, revolutionary riots or individual or group actions in the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins were uninterrupted, inspiring the national revolutionary sentiment and shaking the rule of the Manchu Qing government. At the same time, it打击ed the royalist party and weakened the political influence of all constitutional monarchists. The Tongmenghui became the only banner of the Chinese revolution.

　　When the Manchu Qing government fell, the Tongmenghui immediately split into many opportunistic and reactionary political factions. From then until the reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1924, there was no revolutionary democratic party in China, only a small group called the Chinese Revolutionary Party organized by Sun Yat-sen. It was not as large and active as the Tongmenghui. The reason why the Tongmenghui disintegrated was because their common revolutionary goal was to overthrow the Manchus. They thought that all political evils in China were only in the royal family and its nobles, and completely separated the Han warlords, bureaucrats, and imperialists from the Manchus. Therefore, they blurred the connection of the entire feudal system, and only removed the roof of the feudal upper class, that is, they stopped after removing an emperor. Not only did they abandon the equalization of land rights, but they did not do the work of eradicating feudalism, and lived in peace with all landlords, and cooperated with all major bureaucrats in the Han nationality. The Han warlords and bureaucrats not only did not lose anything, but were promoted to revolutionary officials, made revolutionary fortunes, and corrupted some revolutionary elements. From then on, they absorbed most of the politicians in the constitutional monarchy faction and some traitors in the Tongmenghui, and made them their henchmen. The Chinese Revolutionary Party lost its foothold in China and became a party in exile. The rampage of warlords began under these conditions. However, the revolutionary banner, that is, the banner of democratic republic, was nominally the same, and became a common banner of revolution and counter-revolution.

　　The warlords fought recklessly without any scruples, and the imperialists unscrupulously plundered the vast masses of China, oppressing them to the point of suffocation. Revolutionary thought was chaotic, and there was an extreme need for revolution, but no way out could be found. Sun Yat-sen, a member of the revolutionary faction, could not find a way out either, because Sun Yat-sen could not mobilize the masses like Hong Xiuquan. The old democratic revolutionary methods had long become a thing of the past, the new revolution had not yet arrived, and the new revolutionary class did not have enough strength, so it was interrupted.

　　When the First World War broke out in Europe, the imperialists' rule in China was weakened, the Chinese bourgeoisie and proletariat developed, and the success of the Russian social revolution aroused the excitement of the people in the world's colonies. The cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the reorganization of the Kuomintang were successful. Since the disintegration of the Tongmenghui, only the Chinese Revolutionary Party, a small revolutionary political faction, was left. From then on, there were the Chinese Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the successors of the Tongmenghui. The Chinese Revolution of 1925-27 developed to the two major basins of the Pearl River and the Yangtze River, frightening the imperialists and the Chinese feudal and comprador classes. They wanted to find agents in the revolution to destroy the revolutionary parties and make the broad masses lose their leaders. Chiang Kai-shek was the right candidate for the agent of imperialism, landlords, and compradores. Chiang Kai-shek was a person from the stock exchange and an outstanding figure among the gangsters. He would do anything unscrupulously, as long as it was beneficial to himself, and he would not hesitate to betray the nation and all his partners. He dared to do whatever he wanted without any scruples, and he was easily mistaken by people as having "genius" and "revolutionary nature." Sun Yat-sen was fooled by him, and our opportunist Chen Duxiu was also fooled by him. In fact, when he took office as the principal of the Whampoa Military Academy, he stated that he did not want to be the principal of the military academy, saying that he was afraid that he would become a "warlord" in the future. This was just a statement of so-called "fifty taels of silver hidden in the cabinet," but the revolutionary people were not vigilant enough, so that Chiang Kai-shek's several conspiracies were not thoroughly investigated. The main reason was Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunist leadership, which adopted a policy of compromise and surrender, so that Chiang Kai-shek could seize the leadership and carry out the counter-revolutionary "purification."

　　After the "purification," the Chinese Kuomintang existed in name only. Most of the leftists were massacred or transferred to the Communist Party. The real successors of the Tongmenghui to this day are not the veterans of today's Kuomintang, and the revolutionaries today are only a handful of people in the opposition. The true inheritors of the spirit of the Xinhai Revolution are only the Chinese Communist Party and no others. Comrades, the historical task of China's liberation, the task that the Xinhai Revolution failed to complete in the past, rests on our shoulders!

　　从今日回忆辛亥革命
    徐特立
    【新华社陕北十三日电】中国著名教育家、中共中央委员徐特立同志于辛亥革命三十六周年特发表“从今日回忆辛亥革命”一文，原文如下：
    辛亥革命至今三十六周年了，回忆当时的情况，尤其我省湖南的情况，可作今日教训者略述于左：
    武昌起义是十月十日，湖南响应是十月十九日，湖南领导起义者是焦达峰和陈作新，他们是同盟会领导下的会门中的平民领袖，当时长沙城士大夫阶级，尤其是教育界负责人不愿意平民领袖来领导，即推戴君主立宪派中之谭延来组织政府，焦、陈二人忙于援助武昌起义军，政权就落到立宪派之手。革命军队赴武昌后，谭派军官即在后方进行反革命的暴动，焦、陈被杀；从此湖南的革命旗帜一共九日就被反革命夺去了，革命领袖被反革命杀掉了。革命爆发之日，焦、陈提出的口号是“革命排满”，而谭延来提出的口号是“维持治安，保全秩序”。最大多数的革命同志以为满清官吏一倒，就是革命成功，地方士绅当然主张维持地方秩序，保全地方的治安，不知道革命是要破坏旧秩序和扰乱旧治安的。出于革命派思想上混乱，以致敌我不分、绅民不分、认敌作友而失败了。不独湖南如此，各省亦相同。例如武昌起义是下级军官领导的，下级起义者自己不抓军权和政权，而推戴害怕革命的高级军官黎元洪为都督，不推戴自己的同志，而推戴上司，阶级意识模糊的结果，就认贼作父了。
    辛亥革命前，民主共和派和君主立宪派是针锋相对的斗争，同盟会反对满清，同时要反对君主立宪派。由于不斗争就不能生存。因此，同盟会前六个年头中，在扬子江和珠江流域革命的暴动或个人或集团没有间断过，振奋了全国革命的情绪，动摇了满清政府的统治。同时打击了保皇党，削弱了一切君主立宪派的政治影响，同盟会成为中国革命的唯一旗帜。
    当满清政府一倒，同盟会立刻就分裂成为许多投机的及反动的政派，从此一直到一九二四年国民党改组时止，中国没有革命的民主主义政党，光有孙中山所组织的中华革命党一小集团，它还不及同盟会的庞大和积极性，同盟会之所以瓦解，由于他们革命的共同目标是排满，以为中国一切政治上的罪恶只在皇室和其贵族，把汉族的军阀、官僚和帝国主义与满清完全分开。因此，模糊了整个封建制度的联系，仅仅铲去了封建上层的屋顶，即铲除了一个皇帝就停止了。不独放弃平均地权，封建掘根的工作没有做，而与一切地主和平共居，并对汉族中的一切大的官僚都与之合作。汉族中的军阀官僚不独没有损失丝毫，且升作革命官，发了革命财，且腐化了一些革命分子；从此吸收了立宪派中的大部分政客和同盟会中的某些叛徒，作他们的党羽。中华革命党失掉了在中国的地盘，成为流亡的党派；军阀横行就在这条件下开始了。但革命旗帜，即民主共和的旗帜，名实不分，成了革命和反革命共同的旗帜。
    军阀毫无顾忌地混战，帝国主义毫无顾忌地宰割中国广大群众，压迫到不能喘息。而革命思想混乱，极端需要革命，又找不到出路，革命派的孙中山也找不到出路；由于孙中山还不能象洪秀全那样发动群众。旧的民主革命方式早就成了过去，新的革命还没有到来，新的革命阶级还没有足够的力量，因此中断了。
    至欧洲第一次世界大战爆发了，帝国主义在中国的统治削弱了，中国的资产阶级和无产阶级发展了，加上俄国社会革命成功，引起世界殖民地人民兴奋，国共合作和国民党从新改组就成功了。自从同盟会瓦解后，只剩下中华革命党一个革命的小政派，从此就有了同盟会的继承人中国国民党和共产党一九二五——二七中国大革命，发展到了珠江和扬子江两大流域，吓坏了帝国主义和中国的封建及买办阶级；他们要在革命中找代理人，用来破坏革命党派，使广大群众失掉领袖。蒋介石恰是帝国主义和地主及买办代理人的人选，蒋介石是交易所出身的人，又是流氓中的特出人物，一切不择手段，只要有利于自己，而不惜出卖民族国家和一切伙伴，毫无顾忌的敢做敢为，容易被人们误认为他有“天才”，有“革命性”，孙中山上了他的当，我们的机会主义者陈独秀也上了他的当。其实当他就职黄埔军校校长时，即声明他不愿任军校校长，他说恐怕将来也成“军阀”，这刚是所谓“柜内无银五十两”的声明，但革命的人们警觉性不够，致使蒋介石几次的阴谋没有深究。主要是陈独秀右倾机会主义的领导，采取妥协投降政策，蒋介石得以夺取领导权，得以进行反革命的“清党”。
    自“清党”后，中国国民党名存实亡，左派大部分被屠杀或转入共产党，真正至今日还算得同盟会的继承人，已不是今日的国民党中的元老，今日还是革命者只是寥若晨星的在野者。真正继承辛亥革命精神的只是中国共产党而非其它，同志们，中国的解放历史任务，过去辛亥革命未完成的任务，是落在我们的肩上！
