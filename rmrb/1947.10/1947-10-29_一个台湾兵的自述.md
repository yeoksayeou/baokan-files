　　A Taiwanese Soldier's Confession
  　A Dead End
    I was deceived into joining the army. My name is Wu Jinshui, from Hsinchu. My father was called to a meeting by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit personnel. He saw a recruitment advertisement and told me when he got back: "The motherland's army is different from the Japanese devils' army. Now they are recruiting. That's great! They give three thousand yuan a month, and you can also study Chinese. Go, study hard, learn the national language. It will be easier to do things and deal with people in the future. It won't take long, and you won't have to leave Taiwan. You can even ask for leave to come back and see us every week. You don't have to take care of the family, so go."
    I listened to my father and went to the army. It seemed good. They treated me to a good meal. On the third day, I went, joining the infantry as a member of the second squad, seventh company, third battalion, 28th regiment, 140th brigade of the 70th division.
    After a month, I knew everything. I had been fooled. I only received 40 yuan in legal tender a month. There was no learning of northern dialects, national language, Chinese characters, or anything else. All there was, was standing and running on the parade ground every day. Once, I didn't understand something they said in the northern dialect, and I was immediately given two slaps. If I didn't hold the bowl properly for the older soldiers, I would also get two lashes with a leather belt. After a month, when I wanted to ask for leave to go home, the company commander refused, saying that Taiwanese soldiers would desert if they were granted leave. I saw people being beaten on the buttocks and put in solitary confinement, and some were even beaten to death.
    Later, I gave eggs and sweet rice porridge to the squad and platoon leaders, and then I was finally granted leave. I went home and told my father, "I'm not doing it anymore!" My father said, "Things have come to this, you can't quit. The Zhang family's son ran away, and even his eight-year-old child was taken away. You should go back."
    Because I was afraid of implicating my family, I went back to be beaten and suffer.
    Where Did the Corpse Go?
    Luo Jiansheng was an eighteen-year-old youth. He joined the army under the deception of "Building a New Taiwan."
    In early September, he fell ill. There was no medicine to take, but they still made him run. In order to get medicine and see a doctor, he asked for leave to go home to get money, but his superiors refused. So, on the night of the eighth, he ran away on his own. When he reached the Chiayi train station, he was caught and brought back, accused of desertion. The company commander immediately ordered him to be stripped naked, hung on a pole, with his feet off the ground. The company commander said: Taiwanese soldiers desert. You Taiwanese soldiers beat him yourselves, fifty lashes each.
    After the beating, four or five of us carried him back, trying to save him, but he died soon after. My tears fell on his corpse….
    The next day, the brigade commander came to inspect the army. The sanitation platoon leader told us to carry his corpse to the latrine to hide it. After the brigade commander's inspection, the company commander ordered us Taiwanese soldiers to assemble for drills. When we returned from the drills, the corpse was gone. I came back and couldn't find the corpse, so I asked a boy of ten or so nearby, and he pointed to where the corpse was buried. But when I asked the company commander again, "Where did the corpse go?" he said, "I don't know."
    Liu Sande was a twenty-three-year-old youth. He was my fellow villager. We studied together since we were little, and he worked in an airplane factory before joining the army. When we were being escorted away from Taiwan, he was very ill and couldn't walk. The superior ordered us to carry him onto the ship and put him on the top of the cabin. I was worried, so I pretended to defecate in the dark and went to the top of the cabin to see him. As soon as I got to him, the company commander came over and shouted, "What are you doing here?" I replied, "I'm checking on this patient, he's my relative." The company commander said sternly, "Slaves of a conquered nation, what relative or not, you take care of yourself." I lowered my head and went down to the cabin.
    The next morning, I pretended to defecate again and went up to see him. He was stiff and dead, and his clothes were gone, he was naked. I returned to the cabin with tears in my eyes. I wanted to send a blanket to cover him. The company commander said, "Is this your business?" I said, "It's hard to see him like this." The company commander said, "What's so hard? What's it matter if a soldier dies? It's just like sacrificing for the motherland on the battlefield. He is glorious. We'll bury him properly in Shanghai…, take the blanket back." I said, "It's not good to be naked, let's cover him." The company commander cursed, "If you don't take it back, I'll shoot you." I had no choice but to come down from the cabin, waiting to send him off in Shanghai. When we arrived in Shanghai, we waited for two days with no news. I asked a soldier, and he said that he was thrown into the sea on the way. I cried loudly when I heard this. I cried for him, and I cried for myself. We only have one dead end.

　　一个台湾兵的自述
  　一条死路
    我是被骗来的，我叫巫金水，新竹人。我的父亲被蒋匪人员叫去开会。他看见招兵广告，回来对我说：“祖国的队伍就是与日本鬼子队伍不一样。现在招兵了。真好呀！一个月给三千元，又有汉书读，你去吧，好好念念书，学会国语，以后办什么事，打什么交道，都不困难。时间又不长，又不离开台湾，每个礼拜还可以请假回来看看，家里头不要你照顾，你去吧。”
    我听了父亲的话，往军队那里走了一遭，感到很好，他们留我吃了一顿好饭。第三天我就去了，去七十师一四○旅二八团三营七连二班当步兵。
    去了一个多月，什么事情都知道了。原来上了他们的当。一月只发法币四十元，学北方话、国语、汉字等等一切都没有。有的只是每天在草场上站着、跑着。一次不知他们说了什么北方话，我没听懂，马上就给了两个巴掌。与老兵端碗没端好，也挨了两皮带。一个月后，我要请假回家，连长不准假，说台湾兵请假都要开小差。我看到有的人被打屁股，坐禁闭，也有被打死了的。
    后来我送鸡蛋甜米饭给班、排长们，请假才算准了。我回家对父亲说：“不干了！”父亲说：“事情到了这样，不干也不成。张家儿子因跑了，连八岁小孩也被带去了，还是去吧。”
    我因怕连累家庭，就回去挨打受气去了。
    死尸到那里去了
    罗鉴生是十八岁的青年。在“建设新台湾”欺骗下参军了。
    在九月初，他病了，没药吃，还拖着他跑步。他为了吃药看病，请假回家拿钱，上级不准。因此就在初八那夜里自动跑回去，当他走到嘉义车站旁，就被抓回去了，说是开小差。连长马上命令把他脱光衣服，吊到棒子上，脚不着地吊着。连长说：台湾兵开小差，你们台湾兵自己打，每人打五十下。
    打完了，我们四五个人把他抬回去，想办法救活他，但他随即就死了。我那泪落在他那尸头上……。
    第二天，旅长来检查军队。卫生排长叫我们把他的死尸抬到毛房里去藏。旅长检查走了，连长叫我们台湾兵集合出操。出操回来，死尸就不见了。我回来找不到死尸，便问附近一个十多岁的小孩，他指着告诉我死尸埋着的地方。但当我再问连长：“死尸那里去了？”他说：“不知道。”
    刘三德是二十三岁的青年，他是我的老乡。从小念书在一块，参军前在飞机工厂作工。我们被押离台湾时，他就病得很重，不能走路。上官叫我们把他抬上轮船，放到船舱顶上。我不放心，黑夜里假装大便，到舱顶上去看，刚走到他根前，连长过来了，大声喊道：“你来干什么？”我答：“看看这个病人，他是我的亲戚。”连长声色俱厉的说：“亡国奴，什么亲戚不亲戚，你管你自己吧。”我低着头下舱去了。
    第二天上午，我又装大便上来看他，他硬挺挺的死了，身上衣服也没有了，赤身露体的，我噙着眼泪回到舱里。想送一条毯子给他遮体。连长说：“这事要你管？”我说：“看见他这样，怪难过的。”连长说：“难过什么？当兵的死一个半个算个鸟事。不过他虽然是病死的，也是象为祖国在战场上牺牲一样光荣。到上海再好好埋葬……，毡子你拿回去。”我说：“赤身露体不好，给他盖上吧。”连长骂了：“你再不拿回去我枪毙你。”我只好从舱上下来，等待到上海去送葬。到了上海，等了两天也没动静。我找了一个兵问了一声，他说在中途就丢到海里了。我听了大哭一场。我哭他，也哭我自己，我们只有一条死路。
