　　In Memory of My Father
　　Xu Lei
　　On the morning of September 21st, I was on my way from the Fifth District of Songjiang Lalin to the Fourth District to attend the mass representative meeting celebrating our complete liberation. Midway, a courier galloped up to me with a double-registered urgent letter. I quickly tore it open and the news of my father's death stabbed me like a sharp knife. Tears flowed down, and I felt a wave of dizziness, almost falling off my horse. After a moment of stunned silence, I mustered my courage and continued forward, my heart filled with grief and my eyes filled with tears, recalling everything about my father.
　　My father's life was full of hardships, difficulties, and tribulations. Around the time of the Xinhai Revolution, in order to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and the feudal warlords, he endured cold and hunger, running around with revolutionary comrades to fight together. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, out of hatred for Chiang Kai-shek's tyrannical, nation-harming, and people-harming traitorous dictatorial policies, filled with patriotic zeal, he wrote many poems and articles denouncing Chiang, and even abandoned my mother and young me, attempting suicide by cutting his abdomen at Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum in Nanjing. Fortunately, he was saved by a friend, thus avoiding death. For decades, my father traveled north and south, seeing darkness and corruption everywhere in the Kuomintang. He worried daily about the impending demise of the motherland, exhausting all his strength to fight against the rulers, which caused him to develop a body of incurable diseases. But finally, he found a way out, recognizing that only the Communist Party could save China. After the Jinxi Incident in 1939, my father led the New Army and joined hands with General He Long to establish the Jin Northwest Base Area. Despite dragging his sick body, he still cheerfully persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle in the Jin Northwest under harsh enemy conditions, regaining his youthful enthusiasm and vitality. When I met my father in Yan'an in 1941, although he was ill, his spirit was so peaceful and happy. The troubles of a few years ago had completely disappeared, making me understand that he had truly found the path to light. While he was in Yan'an, although he was ill, he still worried about the country and the people day and night. He often told me, "Only by following the Communist Party can we save China from fire and water." This made me study revolutionary principles diligently in Yan'an, establish the will to serve the people, join the Communist Party, and become a revolutionary fighter. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I enthusiastically rushed to the Northeast. When I recently heard the call for a full-scale counter-offensive, I became even more determined to bury myself in work, hoping to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek traitor and reunite with my father in an independent and free homeland. Unexpectedly, my father passed away just as the great counter-offensive began. Although he could not personally witness the liberation of the people of the whole country, the liberation of the people of the whole country is certain. My father's death is a loss to the people, but his death will inspire revolutionary comrades to work harder for the early victory of the revolution. Rest in peace, Father! Chiang Kai-shek's doomsday is not far away, and we will commemorate you with the upcoming victory of the counter-offensive.
　　The tireless horse carried me to my destination. Seeing the joy of the liberated peasant representatives comforted my heart. I suppressed my grief and said a final farewell to my father, filled with new strength to devote myself to the intense work.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　September 21st, in the Fourth District of Lalin.

　　悼我的父亲
    续磊
    九月二十一日的上午，我从松江拉林五区到四区去参加群众庆祝彻底翻身的代表大会，中途通讯员飞马赶来给我一封双挂号的急信，我连忙撕开一看，父亲病逝的消息，就象一把尖刀似的刺入腹中，眼泪跟着流下来，只觉得面前一阵昏黑，几乎掉下马来，呆痴了片刻后，我才怀着满腔的悲痛，鼓起勇气继续前进，含着满眶的热泪追忆着父亲的一切。
    父亲的一生是历尽了艰苦困难和波折磨难的，辛亥革命前后为了推翻满清和封建军阀的统治，他曾饱受冻馁，东奔西跑与革命志士们共同奋斗。民国二十四年因痛恨蒋介石暴虐害国害民的卖国独裁政策，充满了满腔爱国热诚，在写了许多痛骂蒋贼的诗文后，曾不惜抛弃母亲和年幼的我，在南京中山陵破腹自杀，幸为朋友所救，始免于死。父亲几十年来南北奔波，看到国民党到处是黑暗与腐败，他整日为面临垂危的祖国担忧，竭尽自己一切力量和统治者斗争，致使他得了一身难以治愈的疾病，但最后他终于找到了出路，认清只有共产党才能救中国。一九三九年晋西事变后，父亲带领新军和贺龙将军携手创立了晋西北根据地，虽是拖着多病的身体；却仍在敌后艰苦环境下愉快的坚持着晋西北抗日斗争，恢复了青年的热情与朝气。一九四一年我在延安和我父亲见面时，他虽在病中，但他的精神却是那样安然愉快，几年前的烦恼已毫不存在了，使我了解他是真正找到了光明的途径。他在延安时虽在病中，却仍日夜为国家人民操心担忧，他常告诉我：“只有跟着共产党走，才能救中国出于水火”。使我在延安努力的学习着革命道理，而树立了为人民服务的意志并且参加了共产党，成了一个革命的战士，抗日战争胜利后，热情的奔赴东北，当最近听到全面大反攻的号角后，更奋发百倍，决心埋头工作，希望早日打垮蒋介石卖国贼在独立自由的国土与父亲重逢，不料父亲却在大反攻刚开始，就永离人间了。虽然他已经不能亲自看到全国人民的解放，但全国人民的解放已是确定无疑的了。父亲的死是人民的损失，但他的死将唤起革命同志们更努力的争取革命早日的胜利，安息吧！父亲！蒋介石的末日已是不远了，我们将以即将到来的反攻胜利来纪念你。
    不停的马把我驮到了目的地，看到了翻身农民代表们的欢乐，安慰了我的心，我收起悲痛和父亲做了最后的告别，充满着新的力量投入了紧张的工作中。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　九月二十一日于拉林四区。
