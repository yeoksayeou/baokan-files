World Youth Day Congress Dispatch:
	"Long Live Mao Zedong!"
	Zhang Fan from Prague, Czech Republic
	Mao Zedong. The world's democratic youth are familiar with this glorious name, but they have never seen the face of our great leader. When we held high a huge portrait of Chairman Mao, accompanied by fluttering national flags, and entered the opening ceremony of the Youth Day Congress, young men and women swarmed around us, asking questions in English, French, and Russian. They recognized the leader of the Chinese people, and the enthusiastic youth applauded, laughed, and jumped for joy. Many cameras were pointed at this huge portrait, and our comrades, who were answering various questions, were constantly pulled down to the bottom of the portrait to take pictures. A group of Bulgarian girls in white dresses with silver trim competed to take pictures under Chairman Mao's portrait.
	Chinese students studying in the UK also came to participate in the congress. As soon as they met the youth delegation from the liberated areas, they automatically cooperated with us. Two national flags were placed side by side under Chairman Mao's portrait, and we participated in the opening parade together. Hundreds of thousands of Czech people crowded on the surrounding lawns, with colorful national flags, brightly colored national costumes, and a procession of seventeen thousand youth from seventy-one countries marching forward. Portraits of Stalin, Mao Zedong, Tito, Dimitrov, Hoxha (Prime Minister of Albania), and Choibalsan (Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic) became symbols of excitement and jubilation. Wherever Chairman Mao's portrait went, the cheers were once again ignited. The Czech people waved countless arms and hats, joyfully shouting loudly:
	"Ahoj! (Greetings)"
	During the opening speech, when our representative paid tribute to the world's democratic youth in the name of Comrade Mao Zedong, the cheers and applause swept through the venue like a storm.
	Light songs wafted on the Vltava River, and youth from various countries were active in the beautiful city of Prague. During their interactions, everyone felt that there was nothing more meaningful than exchanging commemorative badges. The Chairman Mao badge we wore became the most cherished souvenir for many young people. At the International Student Union conference, the Soviet representative exchanged his Communist Party commemorative badge for our Chairman Mao portrait. After receiving this precious gift, two representatives from India carefully pinned them on their lapels and smiled happily. The Hungarian representative took his badge to exchange, and after we gave the Chairman Mao portraits we were wearing to them, the third person didn't have one, and he earnestly asked us to find another one for him, and he was happy only after we gave him one. A young man from Palestine wore the Chairman Mao portrait we gave him and said:
	"We want to be students of Mao Zedong, we want to study Mao Zedong's works well."
	We met the North Korean delegation after coming out from a meal. They said they would intensify the study of Mao Zedong's thought, and successively put on our gifts, stood under the hanging portrait of Chairman Mao, and took pictures with us. On the tram, a Hungarian girl looked at my sparkling Chairman Mao portrait, and she asked me for it again. I said:
	"This is the only one."
	She expressed her wish to take it down to have a look, but when it was in her hands, she playfully refused to return it to me. When I asked her to exchange it, she gave a Hungarian Communist Party red flag badge. In this way, we gave many Chairman Mao badges to young people from every country during meetings, entertainment, and other daily contacts. From the struggling Eastern nations to democratic Eastern Europe, from European and American capitalist countries to colonial and semi-colonial Africa and South America, Chairman Mao has left a deep impression in the hearts of young people all over the world.
	Chairman Mao's huge portrait was hung in the exhibition of the Chinese liberated areas, and tens of thousands of young people recognized him during the pilgrimage. The explanations on the exhibition charts also told them about the miracles of the Chinese revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong. The giant portrait was moved to the opening ceremony of the Youth Day Congress, and everyone was no longer unfamiliar with him.
	On August 17th, we once again held high Chairman Mao's portrait and participated in the ranks of the world's youth. The Bulgarian team standing in front of us shouted out as soon as they saw this huge portrait from afar:
	"Comrade Mao Zedong! Comrade Mao Zedong!"
	Cheers and applause followed. The Czech people on the roadside also gathered around, hoping to know how the liberated areas led by Mao Zedong lived and struggled. Comrades who spoke Russian were busy again, and even those who only knew a few words of English and French joined in the explanation.
	The parade moved forward, and the streets of Prague were filled with enthusiastic crowds. From the heights of the buildings to the sidewalks, they held small national flags, colored balls, and flowers to pay tribute to the flags and leaders of each country. As we passed by, "Ahoj!" rang out again. Countless enthusiastic eyes were fixed on the ranks of the youth from the Chinese liberated areas under Chairman Mao's portrait. Countless arms waved at us, and everyone seemed to yearn for us to pay special attention to his friendship from the crowded crowd, and many ran out of the crowd to shake hands with us and sincerely send fruit. The loud shouts of "Mao Zedong", "Mao Zedong" welcomed us. The Czech Youth League even lined up neatly next to the venue and shouted loudly under unified command:
	"Long Live Mao Zedong!"
	"Long Live Mao Zedong!"
	This warm and kind slogan continued until we had gone far away.
	The meeting began, and the Chinese liberated area delegation was ranked at the front of the team, to the left was the great Soviet Union, they held up a huge woven portrait of Marshal Stalin. Countless film cameras and cameras were active. The great portraits of Mao Zedong and the great Stalin left an eternal memory for the youth of the world in the square in front of the ancient Historical Museum in the Czech capital.

    世界青年节大会通讯：
    “万岁毛泽东！”
    张凡寄自捷京布拉格
    毛泽东，世界民主青年熟悉这光辉的名字，但他们却从未见过我们伟大领袖的颜容。当我们高举着毛主席的巨幅绘像伴随着飘荡的国旗走进青年节大会开幕典礼的会场时，男女青年从周围拥上来，以英、法、俄语展开了亲切的询问，因为他们认识了这位中国人民的领袖，鼓掌欢笑热情的青年们，高兴得跳起来了。许多照像机对准了这幅巨像，我们正在答复着各种问题的同志们，不时的被拉到像片的下面来。一群穿银花边白衣服的保加利亚女孩子们，争着到毛主席像下摄影。
    留英的中国学生也来参加大会了，一遇到解放区的青年代表团，他们就自动和我们合作起来，两面国旗并列着在毛主席的像下，我们一块参加了开幕的游行。上十万的捷克群众拥挤在周围的草地上，彩色缤纷的国旗，五光十色的民族服装，七十一个国家，一万七千青年的队伍在行进。斯大林、毛泽东、铁托、季米特洛夫、霍查（阿尔巴尼亚总理）、却伊巴桑（蒙古人民共和国总理）的肖像，成了兴奋和欢腾的标帜。毛主席的像走到那里，那里的欢呼声就又一次被激动起来。捷克群众挥动着无数的臂膀、帽子，喜悦的高声的喊着：
    “阿斯达！（致敬的意思）”
    开幕讲话中，当我们的代表以毛泽东同志的名义向世界民主青年致敬时，欢呼和鼓掌更象暴风一样卷过了会场。
    维尔塔发河上荡漾着轻快的歌声，秀丽的布拉格城里，各国的青年活跃着，在相互的过从中，大家觉得再没有比交换纪念章更有意义的了。我们佩着的毛主席的胸章，成了许多青年最珍爱的纪念品，国际学联的会议上，苏联的代表以他的联共党的纪念章来换我们的毛主席像。印度的两个代表收到我们这宝贵礼物后，小心的佩在衣襟上，高兴得笑了。匈牙利的代表，拿了他的胸章来交换，我们两个人把佩带的毛主席像送给他们后，第三位没有了，他恳切的要求再给他找，直到又送一个给他，他才高兴。巴勒斯坦的青年戴上了我们送给的毛主席像，他说：
    “我们要做毛泽东的学生，我们要好好读毛泽东的著作。”
    吃饭出来遇见了北朝鲜的代表团，他们说要加紧学习毛泽东的思想，纷纷佩上我们的礼物，站在毛主席的挂像下，和我们摄了照片。电车上一位匈牙利的女孩子看着我那眼光灿烂的毛主席像时，她又向我要了；我说：
    “这是仅有的一个”。
    她表示希望拿下来看看，到她手上后，她却顽皮的不还给我了。当我要求她交换时，她送了一个匈共的红旗章。这样我们把许多毛主席的胸章，在开会、娱乐与其他日常的接触中，送给了每一个国家的青年。从斗争着的东方民族到民主的东欧，从欧美资本主义的国家到殖民地半殖民地的非洲和南美。毛主席已在全世界青年的心坎里留下深切的印象了。
    毛主席的巨像悬在中国解放区的展览会里，成千上万的青年在巡礼中认识了他，展览图表上的解释并且告诉了他们毛泽东同志所领导的中国革命的奇迹。巨像移到青年节大会的开幕典礼中，大家对他再不陌生了。
    八月十七日，我们又一次高举着毛主席的绘像，参加了世界青年的行列。站在我们前头的保加利亚的队伍，一看见了这幅巨像远远就叫起来：
    “毛泽东同志！毛泽东同志！”
    欢呼和掌声跟着开始了。道旁的捷克人民也围拢来，他们希望知道毛泽东所领导的解放区是怎样生活、斗争的。会说俄国话的同志又忙起来，连只懂几句英、法语的也参加了解释。
    游行的队伍前进了，布拉格的街上挤满了热情的群众，从楼房的高处到行人道上，他们拿着小国旗、彩球和鲜花，向每一个国家的国旗及领袖致敬。我们走过来，“阿斯达”！又响成一片了。无数热情的眼睛注视着毛主席像下中国解放区青年的行列。无数的臂膀向着我们挥动着，每个人都象渴望着我们能从拥挤的人群中特别注意到他的友情，很多跑出人群来和我们握手，并诚意的送了水果来。“毛泽东”，“毛泽东”响亮的呼声迎接着我们。捷克的青年团更在会场旁边排成整齐的队伍，在统一指挥下高声呼喊着：
    “万岁毛泽东！”
    “万岁毛泽东！”
    这热情而亲切的口号，直到我们走过很远，还继续着。
    开会了，中国解放区代表团排在队伍的前面，左边就是伟大的苏联，他们高举着一幅巨大的史大林元帅的织像。无数的电影机、照相机在活动，伟大的毛泽东与伟大的史大林的巨像，在捷克首都古老的历史博物馆前的广场上，给全世界的青年留下永恒的纪念。
