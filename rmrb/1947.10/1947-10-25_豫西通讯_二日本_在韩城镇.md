　　Yu Xi Correspondence
  　“Second Japan” in Hancheng Town
    Yan Jin
    [Our paper, Taiyue, 23rd dispatch] Comrade Yan Jin from the Yu Xi front reports: Hancheng Town, located fifty miles southwest of Yiyang on the Luo River, is a large town with a thousand households. It originally had over two hundred businesses and was exceptionally bustling. However, after the "Second Japan" (Chiang bandit) 3rd Reorganized Division occupied and plundered it, everything was swept away.

    On the night of October 9th, a raging fire broke out in Hancheng Town and nearby villages. This was the sign of the Chiang bandits retreating after their looting. In this raging fire, countless thatched houses and wheat straw stacks in Hancheng Town and nearby villages were thrown into the blaze. When the reporter entered Hancheng Town with the army, the fire had not yet been extinguished. Along the way were piles of large carts, plows, seed drills, boxes, cabinets, and newly cut fruit trees, all used by the Chiang bandits to create barricades, and now destroyed by artillery fire. The watchtowers standing at the entrances to villages and along the streets were built by piling up soil in bamboo baskets seized from merchants.

    The streets were deserted, only the ashes of the fires set by the Chiang bandits during their retreat were visible. The bed boards and door panels of the southern people were all taken to reinforce bunkers and bridges. Shelves and cabinets were overturned and in disarray. No merchant in the entire town escaped unscathed. The Hefeng Yongzhong Western Building Materials Store was completely trampled and wrecked. Shop assistant Zhang Xin was shivering, naked and wrapped in a piece of cloth. He said with resentment: "They took everything except the medicine. Even our clothes were stripped away. The 'Damn Army' is truly the Second Japan."

    After the Chiang bandits finished looting the people's grain, they panicked and blocked the four gates, preventing people from entering or leaving, causing many ordinary people to starve. The reporter interviewed more than a dozen families, four or five of whom had not eaten for three to five days. Yang Yulin, a 39-year-old resident of Dongqin, starved to death. Zhao Huanzhang of Xizhai was a 53-year-old man with a family of four. They had been hungry for four or five days. On the fifth day, unable to bear it any longer, his wife took their little daughter out to beg for food, but they never returned. Zhao himself is now sick in bed, emaciated beyond recognition. It is known that more than twenty people have died of starvation. In addition, women also suffered a great calamity. To avoid the Chiang bandits' rape, they hid in sweet potato cellars for refuge, but they were still caught and raped by the "Second Japan". In the house of a merchant in West Street, "Second Japan" officers forced the man away and tried to rape the woman, driving her to hang herself. When our army drove the Chiang bandits away, the masses emerged from their cellars, angrily denouncing the crimes of the "Second Japan." An old woman who sold steamed buns in the west end happily prayed: "May Heaven bless, may Earth bless, may our troops never leave!"

    The Yiyang Democratic County Government immediately sent people with grain and money to provide relief. The citizens discussed: "If it weren't for the Liberation Army coming and driving away the 'Second Japan', we would have all died."

  　“二日本”在韩城镇
    言进
    【本报太岳二十三日电】豫西前线言进同志报导：宜阳西南五十里洛河上的韩城镇，是拥有千户人家的大市镇。原有二百多家商号，异常热闹。但在“二日本”（蒋匪）整三师的盘据洗劫后，已一扫而光。
    十月九日深夜，韩城镇与附近村庄燃起了冲天大火。这是蒋匪洗劫以后溃退的记号。在这烈火中，韩城镇及附近村庄的无数草房和麦秸堆都被投入大火中。当记者随军进入韩城镇时，火还未熄，沿路堆满蒋匪拉来作鹿砦用的大车、犁、耧、箱柜和新砍下的果木，已被炮火烧毁了。村口和街道上林立的岗楼，是用抢自商民的竹篮盛着土堆起来的。
    街道上寂无人影，只见蒋匪撤退时焚烧的灰烬。南民的床板、门扇都被拉去垫了碉堡和桥。货架、箱柜翻得七零八落。全镇商民无一幸免。合丰永中西建材庄被跷踏得一榻糊涂。店员张新赤身裹着一个布单在发抖，他愤恨的说：“除了药材不要，别的都抢完了。连我们的衣服也被脱走了。‘遭央军’真是二日本。”
    蒋匪在抢完了人民的粮食后，又惊慌的把四门堵住，不让出入，使不少老百姓陷于饥饿之中。记者曾访问了十几家，其中有四五家已三天，五天没有吃东西。东秦三十九岁的居民杨玉林就是被饿死的。西寨赵焕章是五十三岁的老人，全家四口人，饿了四五天，第五天实在支持不下，他的老婆带了小女孩出去讨吃，结果一去不返，现赵本人已病倒在床上，瘦的不成人形。因饿病死的，据知道的有二十多个。此外妇女亦遭受大劫。为躲避蒋匪的奸淫，躲到红薯窖里避难，但仍被“二日本”捉到奸淫了。西街一家商民，“二日本”军官把男人逼走，要强奸女人，逼得女人上吊自杀了。当我军把蒋匪打走了，群众纷纷从地窖里钻出来，激愤的控诉着“二日本”的罪恶。西头一个卖馒头的老太太高兴的祈祷说：“天保佑，地保佑，咱这队伍永远不要走了！”
    宜阳民主县政府当即派人携带粮款来救济，市民纷纷议论说：“要不是解放军来，把‘二日本’打走，咱只有死。”
