Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 19th. Our correspondent Wu Ren reports the details of the capture of Liao Ang, commander of the Chiang army's 76th Division: At dawn on the 11th, Liberation Army soldiers charged into Qingjian City, heading straight for the headquarters of the 76th Division and the 24th Brigade. Everyone was excited and carefully searching for the "fat man" and the "pockmarked face," encouraging each other to "capture Liao Ang and win the first merit."

As early as two days prior, Liao Ang had found what he thought was a "safe" tortoise shell,蜷缩到城东北老关庙的大碉堡里。 But the artillery fire was getting closer and closer, and the bandits in the Old Guan Temple had become turtles in a jar. When a certain platoon of the Liberation Army rushed to the front of the bunker, the Chiang family lackeys of the guard command had already scattered like birds and beasts. Deputy Commander Zhao Qing discovered several officers with long hair frantically钻进窑洞, and shouted, "Don't move!" He led the soldiers straight over. Eight Chiang bandit army officers were in the cave, hiding under the table, behind the door, crouching in the corner of the wall... each with an ashen face and trembling all over, a hundred ugly态, but not forgetting to raise their hands together. Soldier Fan Si ordered, "Surrender and you won't be killed, everyone stand up!" But the fat guy was still愣 in the gap between the stove and the box frame, not moving. When he was pulled to the door, Commander Zhao saw him and said, "This is Liao Ang!" But this "general," who was still威风凛凛 just a day ago, had already been frightened out of his wits. When asked to walk outside, he装得有声有色的说: "I haven't eaten for three days." Another large麻脸爬出来 from under the table, and it was clear at a glance that he was the commander of the 24th Brigade. In his panic, a lost pencil reported his name, with the words "Zhang Xin" engraved on the penholder.

According to the captured Deputy Chief of Staff of the division, Wen Sicheng, on the afternoon of the Double Tenth Festival, when the Liberation Army had cleared the outer strongholds and approached the city walls, the division headquarters still told its subordinates, "Yan'an has a telegram saying that reinforcements are only three miles away from the city." In fact, even Liao Ang was deceived by Hu Zongnan, believing that the deafening炮声 was the排炮 of the reinforcements, and hurriedly sent a staff officer to contact them, but he was hit by shrapnel and fled back with a bloody head. Another telegram said that "reinforcements" had approached the city walls from the northwest, and immediately号兵 to the city walls to blow the号联络. The号兵吹死劲, and his mouth吹肿了, but not a single "reinforcement" was seen. The entire army动摇了, and regardless of officers or soldiers, they were all thinking about a common question: "Should we lay down our weapons or be completely destroyed?!" When a certain general of the Liberation Army sent a letter of friendship from outside the city, advising Liao Ang to lay down his weapons early to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, Division Chief of Staff Liu Xuechao and 24th Brigade Commander Zhang Xin and others守着看信, asking "What to do?" But Liao Ang had already没了主意,喃喃地自言自语: "What if the reinforcements really arrive?!" When the Liberation Army's general offensive began, the transmitter was destroyed by炮弹, and the command post was震憾了. At this time, Liao Ang才从梦中清醒过来, quickly找 Chief of Staff and Brigade Commander询问 "Has the envoy from outside the city left yet?" The answer was "They left early!" Liao Ang immediately 面色苍白, and didn't say a word.

　　活捉廖昂经过
  　西北前线通讯
    【新华社西北十九日电】分社记者午人报导活捉蒋军七十六师师长廖昂详情：十一日拂晓，解放军勇士们冲入清涧城，直扑七十六师师部和二十四旅旅部，大家都兴奋而细心地寻找“胖子”和“麻子”，互勉“活捉廖昂得第一功”。
    还在两天前，廖昂就找好自以为“保险”的乌龟壳，蜷缩到城东北老关庙的大碉堡里。但炮火终于愈来愈近，老关庙的匪徒们已成了瓮中之鳖。当解放军某排冲到碉堡跟前时，警卫指挥所的蒋家喽罗们早已各管各的鸟兽散了。副指挥员赵清发现有几个蓄发的军官慌忙地钻进窑洞，就大喝一声“不许动”，并率领战士们直冲过去。窑洞里八名蒋匪军官钻在桌底下，躲在门背后，蹲在墙角落……一个个面如土色，浑身哆嗦，丑态百出，但却没有忘记一齐高举双手。战士樊四命令：“投降不杀，都站出来”，而那个胖家伙却还愣在灶炉和箱架的夹缝中站着不动。当他被拉到门口时，赵指挥员一看便说：“这就是廖昂”，但这个一天前还是威风凛凛的“将军”，早已吓得魂不附体，叫他往外走，他却装得有声有色的说：“我三天没吃饭了”。另一个从桌子底下爬出来的大麻脸，一看就知道他是二十四旅旅长，他在慌忙中失落的铅笔替他报了名，笔杆上刻着“张新”的字样。
    据被俘的该师副参谋长温思程说，双十节下午当解放军已扫清外围据点迫近城垣时，师部还向部下说“延安有电报，援兵只离城三里”。事实上，连廖昂也受了胡宗南的欺骗，满以为震耳欲聋的炮声是援兵的排炮，连忙派一个参谋去联络，结果是被弹片打得头破血流逃了回来。另一个电报说“援兵”已从西北方接近城垣，又马上派号兵到城墙上去吹号联络。号兵死劲吹，嘴也吹肿了，“援兵”却一个没见。全军动摇了，不论官兵都想着一个共同的问题“放下武器还是完全毁灭”！？当解放军某将军由城外送来友谊的信，劝廖昂早早放下武器以免无谓牺牲时，师参谋长刘学超和二十四旅旅长张新等都守着看信，追问“怎么办”？可是廖昂早已没了主意，喃喃地自言自语“援兵真的到了又怎么办”？！等到解放军总攻开始，发报机被炮弹打毁，指挥所震撼了。这时廖昂才从梦中清醒过来，赶紧找参谋长和旅长询问“城外来使走了没有”？回答是“早走了”！廖昂立刻面色苍白，一声不响。
