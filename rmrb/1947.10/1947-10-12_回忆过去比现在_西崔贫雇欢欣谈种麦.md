　　Recalling the Past Makes the Poor and Hired Happier Talking About Wheat Planting
    [Our Shahe News] The wheat planting competition in Xicui Village was basically completed by October 3rd (leaving only 89 mu of plowed land not yet sown). Each group was discussing the issue of earning merits and winning the flag. On the 4th, it rained and work in the fields was impossible. The leadership convened a conference of more than 120 poor and hired peasant men and women. The main topic was to clearly identify who should be credited for this year's production achievements, starting with a discussion on wheat planting. Everyone was asked to discuss: "How is our wheat planting this year?" Zhang Suocheng said, "In the old society, I only had a mu or so of land. Every year, people would finish planting theirs, and I would still be worried about how to plant mine. Before planting, I didn't know what to feed people, so I couldn't focus on the main thing. I even had to buy steamed buns and pancakes for them. This year, with mutual aid, I planted six mu of wheat without any worries. The wheat seeds were prepared by the cooperative long ago. I planted the wheat first and then paid back the debt by spinning cotton. I can't plow or sow (I used to be a mat weaver), but I still planted early." Pei Yonghe's wife said, "In the past, I could barely plant two mu of land, steamed buns for others, and didn't have good dishes. I ran from east to west, borrowing oil and salt, crying and laughing. They would plant my wheat after theirs came out! This year, I planted four mu of wheat without any effort." Ma Zan said, "Before, I didn't have livestock, and I couldn't plant five or six mu of land. No matter how nicely I asked people, I couldn't even use their livestock. It really drove me to death." At this point, she started crying, and many people lowered their heads, their eyes red. She continued, "We planted our land late and didn't have fertilizer, so we couldn't harvest enough grain to eat. This year, my husband joined the army, and the masses cultivated the land for me, plowing it deep and fine. If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party, how could I have ever lived like this?" Shen Rui said, "When the puppet soldiers were here, they demanded money from us, so I had to sell two of my children. My eldest child and his father went to be porters and haven't returned to this day." At this point, she was crying so hard she couldn't speak. Everyone in the meeting hall shed tears. Zhang Yuxiang said, "I've grown up so much, and I've never had my own wheat harvest. Last year, I got land, and this year, I ate white steamed buns. I've already planted ten mu or so, and I'm going to plant two or three mu of sorghum too. Next year, I'll be able to harvest even more, and I'll be able to eat noodles several times!" The discussion turned to whether following the Communist Party could lead to prosperity. Zhenhai said, "Definitely! We've only just begun to prosper! We'll be richer year after year." Yan Gui said, "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, our village wouldn't be able to finish planting in another half month. Planting early this year saved us one sheng of wheat seed per mu. Next year, we'll harvest one dou more per mu, and our village will gain 260 more bags (one bag is five dou)." Chi said, "In the past, I planted two mu of land, but I couldn't afford to plow it, so I just scratched the surface and planted. This year, with mutual aid, we plowed the dry land four times and the stubble land twice, and we planted six mu of wheat early." Zhu Baozhong said, "I'm getting old, and I never believed anything you said in the past. I didn't understand how you were controlling people in meetings all day long, but this wheat planting has convinced me. When I lie in bed at dusk, talking to my wife, I wonder how much knowledge Chairman Mao has in his belly. Everything he comes up with is good. The workers and cadres lead people so well. In the past, I worried about planting as soon as I harvested the millet, and I ran around borrowing livestock for days. This year, I was given two more mu of land, and with mutual aid, I planted it without even going to my land. One day, I went to the field and saw that my land was leveled so flat, and I started singing a 'Da Bangzi' opera tune. I wasn't even singing a proper tune, and the class enemies were also in the field, but I didn't care what they thought. I was happy, so I sang. I felt young again when I worked. I was rejuvenated. Even when it was drizzling, I still wanted to @ the stubble. I thought, in the past, when we worked for others, we couldn't go home even if it rained heavily. Now, we're on our own land, so why not finish it!" Shujing's mother said, "This year, we all have enthusiasm. We feel happy, and people aren't dying anymore. Next year, we'll have even more enthusiasm, and people will be even stronger." From then on, everyone said that it's definitely right to do whatever the Communist Party tells us to do. This past year, we've been the most responsive to calls, pushing water carts during the drought, and actively fighting locusts and pests. The middle peasants in the mutual aid groups had livestock but weren't willing to work hard, and we're the ones who put in the effort to make it good. From now on, it's our turn to be at the table! Today, our eyes are clear. In the past, only the wealthy became top scholars. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek promoted them, but now Chairman Mao is leading us. This year, we should give credit to ourselves. We must ensure that landlords and rich peasants cannot receive any credit at all, and middle peasants cannot be treated the same as us. In the future, we must control all work. This is truly our world! (Xue Ren, Zheng Min, Kui Lin)

　　回忆过去比现在
  　西崔贫雇欢欣谈种麦
    【本报沙河讯】西崔村的竞赛犁地种麦运动，到十月三日基本上已经完成（只留下八十九亩已犁过的地还没耩上），各组都在议论着立功夺旗问题。四日下雨不能进地，领导上召开了一百二十多个贫雇户男女大会，主要内容是从今年的生产成绩中明确认识给谁立功问题，开始先从种麦上谈起，让大家讨论：“咱们今年麦子种的怎样？”张锁成说：“我在旧社会只有亩把地，每年人家都种完了，咱还愁的没法种，种地前都不知道叫人家吃啥好，正经事咱还没法哩，还得给人家买馍馍摊煎饼；今年互助起来种了六亩麦子，一点也没发愁，麦种合作社早就预备下了，咱先种上麦子，再给纺花还帐，我不会犁耩地（过去编席子工人），可是早早就种上了。”裴永和媳妇说：“过去咱一满种二亩地，给人家蒸上馍馍，又没有好菜，东家跑西家跑买油借盐哭一顿笑两顿，人家的麦子出来了，才给咱种呀！今年种了四亩麦，一点劲儿也没费。”马赞的说：“从前咱没牲口，五、六亩地也种不上，和人家说多少好话，使一下牲口还不能，真是把咱逼死。”说到这里他哭起来了，不少的人低下头，眼都红了，她接着说：“咱的地种的晚，又没粪上，打不下粮食还是吃不上，今年俺男人参了军，群众代耕给犁的又深又细，要不是八路军共产党来，我那里还能过到这步天地呢？”申瑞的说：“伪军在的时候向咱要款，没办法把两个小孩都卖了，大孩和他爹去脚夫，至如今没有回来。”说到这里，她哭的说不上话来，全会场的人都流下泪来。张玉祥说：“我长了这么大，自己没有过过五月（麦收），去年得了地，今年也吃上了白馍馍，我已种上了十来亩，还有二、三亩高粱我也要把它种上，明年就更能多打，面条子还不吃几顿哩！”讨论的问题转到了跟上共产党能不能致富，振海说：“一定能，咱才富了个头呀！往后一年比一年富。”延贵说：“要不是共产党领导，咱村再有半月也种不完，今年种的早，每亩地省一升麦种，明年每亩再多打一斗，里外咱村就多得二百六十多布袋（一布袋五斗）。”池的说：“咱过去种二亩地，犁不起，刨刨就种上了，今年互助起来，垡旱地犁了四遍，茬地犁了两遍，早早就种上六亩麦子。”朱保中说：“我年纪也大了吧，过去你们说啥我也不信服，不知道你们整天开会都是怎样摆制人哩，这次种麦子我可征服了，黄昏躺在炕上，和俺孩子娘说起来，我就不知道毛主席肚里有多少点儿哩，出出来都是好处，工作员、干部，把人带领的都多么好，往常年我一割谷子就愁的种不上，头几天就东跑西跑借牲口，今年又给了我二亩地，互助起来，我也没到俺地就种上了，那一天我到地里看着自己的地修的平坦坦的，我就唱起大梆子腔来，我喊的也不是个调，斗争户也在地里可是我也不管他们心里怎样，我心里高兴了就是唱，我做起活来又觉着年轻了，老来红了，天下小雨我还是想＠茬子，我想过去咱给人家干，再下大些也不能回家，现在在自己地里，为啥不做完哩！”书经娘说：“今年咱们都有了心劲，心里痛快，人也不死啦，明年咱心劲更大，人就更结实了。”从此大家都说共产党叫咱干啥咱就干啥保险没错，这一年来，也数咱听号召，抗旱中推水车都是咱这伙人，打蚂蚱打虫子也数咱积极，互助组中农们有牲口还不大愿意干，也是咱们下工夫成好的，以后就该咱们上桌面哩！今天咱的眼擦明了，过去中状元都是人家老财们，那会儿蒋介石就是提拔人家，现在毛主席就是带领的咱，今年立功就得给咱们立，在评功中咱们要掌握，地主、富农根本不能立，中农也不能和咱一样，以后一切工作咱都要掌握，这真正是咱们的天下哩！（学仁、政民、奎林）
