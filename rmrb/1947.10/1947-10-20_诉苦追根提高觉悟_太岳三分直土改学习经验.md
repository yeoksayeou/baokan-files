　　[This dispatch from our newspaper's Taiyue correspondent on the 16th] The Taiyue Third Sub-district direct troops have concluded their "Speak Bitterness" movement and entered into the "Trace Roots" movement. After tracing roots, everyone unanimously realized that their suffering was given by Big Chiang Kai-shek and Little Chiang Kai-shek, and that they must thoroughly eliminate this man-eating beast in order to live. At the sub-district political department's "Trace Roots" meeting, Comrade Hai Zhen believed that his suffering was solely given by the landlord. After discussion, everyone concluded: "Those people have money and power, and they are family with the officials," "In places where the Chiang bandits arrive, the peasants do not dare to struggle against the landlords, and the landlords who have been struggled against return to settle the score." In this way, everyone understood that Chiang Kai-shek and the landlords were one family. In their root tracing, they also gained the following points of experience: (1) Tracing roots and speaking bitterness cannot be completely separated. The bitterness cannot be poured out all at once. In the process of tracing roots, many comrades added to their speaking of bitterness. The leadership should adopt a welcoming attitude, that is, speak bitterness on one hand and trace roots on the other. (2) Within the group, each person can be studied individually. If a typical suffering person or a common ideological problem is found, it can be brought up for everyone to discuss, or the typical person's suffering can be recounted again, and everyone can study the root of his suffering, which makes it easy to clarify some major problems. (3) Tracing roots is more difficult than speaking bitterness. It requires analyzing and understanding problems, but as long as the leadership grasps the mass line of education methods, it is believed that everyone can raise problems and solve them through their own discussions. (4) The fighters see problems directly, and the level of analysis and understanding of problems by cadres cannot be used to demand the fighters. (5) The main goal of tracing roots is to raise class consciousness. It is not possible to solve all problems in one speaking of bitterness and tracing roots, and ideological education should be turned into regular work.

　　诉苦追根提高觉悟
  　太岳三分直土改学习经验
    【本报太岳十六日电】三分区直属队由诉苦转入追根运动，已告一段落。大家经过追根之后，一致明确的认识了苦是大蒋介石和小蒋介石给的，必须彻底消灭掉这吃人兽，才能生活。分政追根大会上，海珍同志认为：他的苦单纯是地主给的，后经大家讨论：“人家有钱有势，和当官的是一家人”，“蒋匪到的地方农民就不敢斗争地主了，斗争过的地主又返回来倒算”；这样大家都明白了，原来蒋介石和地主是一家人。他们在追根中，并获得以下几点经验：（一）追根与诉苦不能截然分开。苦水一下倒不完，在追根过程中，许多同志又补充的诉苦。领导上要采取欢迎态度，即一面诉苦，一面追根。（二）小组内可以一个一个人研究，发现典型的苦人，或带有普遍性的思想问题，提出来让大家讨论，或把典型人的苦再诉一次，大家研究他的苦根，容易将一些主要问题弄明白。（三）追根比诉苦困难。须要分析认识问题，但领导上只要掌握群众路线的教育方法，相信大家能提出问题，又能经过自己讨论解决问题。（四）战士们看问题直接，不可拿干部分析认识问题的程度去要求战士。（五）在追根中主要是提高阶级觉悟。不能求得在一次诉苦追根中就解决一切问题，应把思想教育变成经常工作。
