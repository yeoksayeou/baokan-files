Chiang Kai-shek Spurned by Democratic Students Worldwide
	Communication from the International Student Union Conference in Prague

	The International Student Union Council meeting, held in Prague this August, was attended by representatives from fifty-one countries, representing 2.5 million university students worldwide. At this conference, Chinese students, who are fighting heroically, established close ties with friends from all over the world and were honorably elected as vice-chairmen, receiving a letter of tribute from the International Student Union. Chiang Kai-shek's shameless trick of covering the sky with one hand on the international stage was ridiculed and condemned by students around the world, and Chiang Kai-shek's puppet organization was expelled.

	Last year, the preparatory committee of the International Student Union invited Chinese students to attend the World Student Congress. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek embassy in the UK, under the instruction of Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Education, arbitrarily designated twenty Chinese students studying in the UK, gave them large sums of money to go to Prague to participate, and the twenty claimed to be representatives of the "China University Students Federation." Chiang Kai-shek assured the International Student Union that they were fully capable of representing all Chinese students. This fabricated "delegation" deceived the world for a short time. They not only made remarks distorting the facts in the conference discussions, but one of them, Ou Xilin, was also elected as the vice-chairman of the International Student Union.

	This trick of Chiang Kai-shek forging public opinion aroused the anger of all Chinese students studying in the UK. They convened a meeting to protest to the Chiang Kai-shek government and the twenty pseudo-representatives. At the meeting, the twenty pseudo-representatives had to admit their mistakes. Under strong protests, the Chiang Kai-shek embassy in the UK also wrote a reply stating: "The students who went to Prague last year to participate in the International Student Union Congress were designated by the embassy in accordance with the notification from the Ministry of Education and participated in their individual capacity. This matter has nothing to do with your association." The Chinese Students Association in the UK handed this letter to the International Student Union for verification, and the International Student Union Secretariat preserved it as a photograph. Thus, Chiang Kai-shek's ugly behavior was branded forever on the international stage and despised.

	In July of this year, Chiang Kai-shek also sent a staff member from the embassy in Czechoslovakia, representing the so-called "China University Students Federation," to attend the executive committee of the International Student Union and requested to serve as vice-chairman representing Chinese students. However, based on the results of investigations by the British Student Union, the International Student Service Association, and the World Student Relief Committee, the International Student Union knew that not only was there no "China University Students Federation" in China, but also that this embassy staff member was not a true student representative. Therefore, the executive committee not only did not agree to his continuing as vice-chairman, but also suspended his formal representative status, only allowing him to attend meetings as an observer. After that, this staff member never dared to come to the International Student Union again.

	Thus, the International Student Union was very eager to find genuine representatives of Chinese students and establish contact with them. Therefore, when Chinese student representatives from the Liberated Areas, Zhang Fan, and Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas, Li Yan, arrived in Prague in July, they were warmly welcomed by student representatives from all over the world. The China issue also became an important agenda item for this Council meeting.

	This Council meeting began on July 31st, and the China issue was formally discussed on August 2nd. When the chairman announced the formal discussion of the China issue, the representatives sat nervously in their seats, and the conference showed unprecedented solemnity. First, Li Yan, the student representative from the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled area and vice-chairman of the Anti-American Violence Joint Association of Students in Peiping and Tianjin, stood up and, in front of honest friends from all over the world, denounced Chiang Kai-shek's towering crimes of implementing fascist education, cultivating secret agents, trampling on human rights, and conducting civil war. He also narrated with grief and indignation the heroic struggles of students in Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas from the "December 1st" movement to the anti-civil war and anti-hunger movement in May of this year, involving blood and tears amidst terror and oppression and a lack of food and clothing. After the report, he submitted three demands to the conference (see the first three items of the International Student Union's resolution on the first page).

	After Li Yan's report, warm applause shook the entire hall. Before the chairman could speak, representatives from France and the United Kingdom quickly ran to the podium, announcing their full support for Li Yan's report and proposing several supplementary opinions (see the last four items of the International Student Union's resolution).

	Then, Zhang Fan, the student representative from the Chinese Liberated Areas, stood up to speak. He introduced the happy and free life of students in the Liberated Areas, their studies closely integrated with the construction of the Liberated Areas. Since the outbreak of the patriotic self-defense war, students have gone to the countryside one after another, or organized work teams to rush to the front lines, while a large number have joined the People's Liberation Army. The students in the Liberated Areas are fighting together with the entire Chinese people for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland.

	Zhang Fan gave his report in Chinese. As soon as the report ended, before it could be translated into foreign languages, thunderous applause rang out throughout the hall. This demonstrated the infinite trust and welcome of representatives from various countries for the Chinese Liberated Areas.

	At this time, the American student representative stood up from a corner and said: "We agree with Gang Lan's report, but it is a pity that Gang Lan's report did not mention one thing. As far as I know, the American troops have withdrawn from China."

	Facing this lie, Zhang Fan stood up and made a solemn statement: "The so-called withdrawal of American troops is completely inconsistent with the facts. Now I will only give two examples: First, Qingdao is now entirely an American naval base. Second, the American military advisory group is still stationed in Nanjing, helping and commanding Chiang Kai-shek to fight the civil war."

	The eyes of the entire audience were focused on the American representative who spoke, waiting for him to answer, but under the powerful rebuttal of the Chinese Liberated Area representative, he had nothing to say and just sat motionless in his chair. Later, another American representative changed his statement and requested the conference to "reserve" all the resolutions, especially to reserve the second item regarding calling on American students to organize and demand that the American government change its policy towards China, and the fifth item regarding expelling the Kuomintang puppet organization.

	Zhang Fan gave a loud reply in the conference hall: "The situation is now very clear. This is that American imperialists are helping Chiang Kai-shek to fight the civil war and massacre patriotic students. Therefore, the conference should pass all the proposals."

	The attitude of some representatives of the American delegation aroused dissatisfaction among the vast majority of representatives from various countries. A representative from Romania stood up and sharply questioned: "You specifically requested to reserve the second and fifth items, but what does the expulsion of the Kuomintang's pseudo-representatives have to do with you?"

	Martin, the secretary of the International Student Union, said: "We unanimously believe that the seven proposals are a true expression of the conference's feelings... I believe that everyone is willing to help Chinese students. I propose that we should state that the conference's feelings are sympathetic to the Chinese reports and proposals."

	Indian representative Dang Shi also said: "Like the Romanian representative, I don't know where the difficulty of the second item lies; the remaining points are very clear to the students, that is, to ask for their just support, and I think we should all support this proposal."

	The conference proceeded for more than five hours in heated debates. Under the call of justice, the vast majority of representatives extended their righteous fists, and the seven proposals were successfully passed. Regarding the second proposal of the United States, the drafting committee slightly modified the wording and it also became a resolution of the conference. At the same time, it also passed a resolution to write a letter to pay tribute to Chinese students.

	In the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Student Union, the Kuomintang's pseudo-organizations and pseudo-representatives have been expelled or suspended from membership. The dying group of Kuomintang reactionaries is being spurned and rebuked by people all over the world. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　蒋介石被全世界民主学生唾弃
  　布拉格国际学联会议通讯
    今年八月在布拉格举行的国际学生联合会的理事会，有五十一个国家的代表出席，代表世界二百五十万大学生。在这个大会里，正在英勇战斗的中国学生与全世界朋友建立密切的联系，并光荣当选副主席，得到国际学联的致敬书。蒋匪在国际舞台上扮演的一手遮天的无耻把戏，遭到了全世界学生的嘲笑与谴责，蒋匪的伪组织受到开除的处分。
    去年，国际学联筹委会曾邀请中国学生出席世界学生代表大会。当时蒋匪驻英大使馆在蒋匪教育部指使下，擅自拟定了二十名留英的中国学生，发给他们大批款项到布拉格去参加，二十人自称是“中国大学生联合总会”的代表。蒋匪向国际学联保证他们完全能够代表全中国学生。这个伪造的“代表团”短时期内欺骗了世界人士，他们不但在大会讨论中发表了歪曲事实的言论，而且有一个欧希林还被选为国际学联的副主席。
    蒋匪假造民意的这种骗局，惹起在英国读书的全部中国学生的愤怒，他们曾召集会议，向蒋匪政府及二十名伪代表提出抗议，在会议上二十名伪代表不得不承认错误。蒋匪驻英使馆在强烈的抗议下，也写了这样的一封回信：“去年到布拉格参加国际学联代表大会的学生，是按照教育部通知由大使馆指定，并且以个人资格参加的，此事与贵会无关”。留英同学会把这封信交给国际学联验看，国际学联秘书处把它制成像片保存起来，于是蒋匪的此种丑恶行为便象烙印一样永远地留在国际上受人唾弃。
    今年七月蒋匪还派遣驻捷克使馆的一个职员，代表所谓“中国大学生联合总会”，出席国际学联的执委会，并要求代表中国学生任副主席。但国际学联根据英国学生联合会、国际学生服务总会及世界学生救济委员会等处调查的结果，知道中国不但没有一个“中国大学生联合总会”，而且这个大使馆职员更非真正的学生代表，因此执委会不但没有同意他继任副主席，而且停止了他的正式代表资格，只允许他以旁听的资格出席会议。此后，这个职员就再也不敢到国际学联来了。
    这样，国际学联是很迫切地希望找到中国学生的真正代表，并和他们发生联系。因此当中国解放区学生代表张凡和蒋管区学生代表李彦，在七月到达布拉格的时候，便受到世界学生代表的热烈欢迎。中国问题亦成为本届理事会的重要议程。
    本届理事会是从七月三十一日开始的，在八月二号正式讨论中国问题。当主席宣布正式讨论中国问题的时候，代表们都紧张地坐在自己的席位上，大会显示出从所未有的肃静。首先蒋管区学生代表，也是平津学生抗议美军暴行联合会副主席的李彦站起来，在全世界正直朋友的面前，控诉了蒋介石实施法西斯教育，培养特务，蹂躏人权和进行内战的滔天罪恶，也悲愤地叙述了蒋管区同学在恐怖镇压和无衣食的情况下，自“一二·一”运动到今年五月间反内战反饥饿的血与泪的英勇斗争。报告结束后，即向大会提出三项要求（见第一版国际学联决议的前三项）。
    李彦报告以后，热烈的掌声震撼全场，还没有等到主席发言，法国和英国的代表即迅速跑到主席台前，宣布他们完全支持李彦的报告，而且提出几点补充的意见（见国际学联决议的后四项）。
    接着中国解放区学生代表张凡起立发言了，他介绍了解放区同学的愉快与自由生活，他们的学习与解放区人民的建设密切结合。自从爱国自卫战争爆发后，同学纷纷下乡，或组织工作团奔赴前线，同时大批投入人民解放军中。解放区同学正在和全中国人民在一起，为祖国的独立、和平、民主进行斗争。
    张凡用中文作了报告，报告刚刚结束，还没有等到译成外国语的时候，全场就响起了雷样的掌声。这说明了各国代表对于中国解放区的无限信任与欢迎。
    这时候美国学生代表从一个角落里站起来说：“我们同意刚缆的报告，只可惜刚缆的报告没有提到一件事，据我所知美国军队已经从中国撤退了。”
    张凡面对着这个谎言站起来作了严正的声明：“所谓美军撤退完全不符合事实，现在我只举两个例子：第一、青岛现在完全是美国的海军基地。第二、美国军事顾问团仍旧驻在南京，帮助和指挥蒋介石打内战。”
    全场的目光都集中到那发言的美国代表身上，等待他回答，但他在中国解放区代表有力的驳斥之下无话可说，只是坐在椅子上一动也不动。后来另一个美国代表改换了说法，要求大会“保留”全部决议，特别要保留关于号召美国学生组织要求美国政府改变对华政策的第二项，和开除国民党伪组织的第五项。
    张凡在会场里又作了响亮的答复：“情况现在已经很清楚，这就是美国帝国主义者帮助蒋介石打内战屠杀爱国学生，因此大会应当通过全部建议。”
    美国代表团某些代表的态度招致了各国绝大多数代表的不满，罗马尼亚的一个代表站起来尖锐地质问：“你们特别要求保留第二项与第五项，但是开除国民党的伪代表又与你们有什么相干？”
    国际学联秘书马丁说：“我们一致认为七项提议是大会感情的真正表现……我相信所有的人都愿意帮助中国学生。我提议我们要说明大会的感情是同情中国的报告和建议的。”
    印度代表党氏也说：“我和罗马尼亚代表一样不知道第二项的困难在那里；其余几点对于学生说来是很清楚的，这就是要求他们的正义支持，我想我们都应该支持这提议。”
    大会在热烈的辩论中进行了五个多钟头，绝大多数代表在正义的号召下伸出正义的拳头，七项提议顺利地通过了。关于美国的第二项提议，在起草委员会略微修改字句也成为大会的决议，同时也通过了写信向中国学生致敬的决议。
    在世界职工联合会上，世界民主青年联盟及国际学生联合会中，国民党的伪组织和伪代表都被开除或停止会籍了。国民党反动派这个垂死的集团，受到全世界人民的唾弃和呵责。（新华社）
