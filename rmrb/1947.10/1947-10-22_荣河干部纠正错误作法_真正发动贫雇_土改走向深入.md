(This Newspaper, Taiyue, 20th dispatch) Ronghe, after thoroughly clearing away all erroneous thoughts in implementing the route of relying on poor and hired peasants, boldly mobilized poor and hired peasants to seize leadership in various villages, thereby deepening land reform. In Dongsixiong Village, leadership was originally in the hands of middle peasants. This time, through speaking bitterness, they discovered and cultivated activists from among the poor and hired peasants, and established a fixed meeting of poor and hired peasant activists to replace the original leadership. All issues were first discussed by the poor and hired peasants to unify their opinions, and then submitted to the general membership meeting of the Farmers' Association for approval. Therefore, in the distribution of the fruits of struggle in the village, the demands of the poor and hired peasants could be initially met. As poor peasant activist Chen Qiyun said: "Everything must be discussed by us, the hired and poor, in a meeting first. Because we are of one mind. In the past, at general meetings, others had more people, and a shout would decide things. We, the hired and poor, had opinions but did not dare to raise them, and had to echo them." In Zhichi Village, the struggle had not been launched for a long time in the past. This time, the deadlock was broken through mobilizing the hired and poor. First, the hired and poor attracted each other by sharing their sufferings, and the number of people speaking bitterness increased from five to sixteen, and even thirty-three, strengthening the peasant ranks. As a result, the masses had their own strength. Wang Yousheng said: "The world in the past belonged to the landlords, but today's world belongs to us poor people." After the hired and poor of Xie Village participated in the activist meeting in the urban area, the work in the village was completely renewed. The Farmers' Association was led by hired peasant Ding Menwa and others, developing ×× militiamen to defend the emancipation, suppress reactionary landlords and armed secret agents' activities, and mobilized poor peasant women to participate in the struggle and ×× women to join the militia. Every day, they divided their work with the male militiamen to check pedestrians, investigate household registrations, and capture Li Ziyou, the target of struggle in Bilizhuang.

　　荣河干部纠正错误作法
  　真正发动贫雇
  　土改走向深入
    【本报太岳二十日电】荣河自清算了走贫雇路线中的一切错误思想后，各村即大胆发动贫雇掌握领导权，土地改革由此走向深入。东思雄村领导权原来掌握在中农手里，此次在诉苦中发现与培养贫雇积极分子，并建立了固定的贫雇积极分子会议，代替了原来的领导，一切问题先经过贫雇讨论，统一了意见，再拿到全体农会会员大会通过。因此，该村分配斗争果实中，能够初步满足贫雇的要求。正如贫雇积极分子陈启云所说：“一切事情，非雇贫先开会讨论不可。因为咱们是一心人。过去开大会，人家人多，一声喊就定了。咱们雇贫有意见也不敢提了，只好随声附和。”置池村过去斗争一直未搞起来，此次亦从发动雇贫突开了沉闷的局面。首先雇贫以苦引苦，诉苦的人便由五人增加到十六人，以至卅三人，壮大了农民阵容，因而群众有了自己的力量，王有生说：“以前的天下是老财的，今日的天下可是咱们穷人的了。”谢村雇贫参加了城关积极分子会议后，村内工作便焕然一新。农会由雇贫丁闷娃等领导，发展了××名民兵保卫翻身，镇压反动地主与武装特务的活动，并发动了贫雇妇女参加斗争和××名妇女参加民兵。她们每天与男民兵分工盘查行人、清查户口，捉住了比里庄的斗争对象李自有。
