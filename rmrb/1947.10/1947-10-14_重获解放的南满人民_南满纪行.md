　　The People of Southern Manchuria Regain Liberation
  　A Travelogue of Southern Manchuria
    Liu Baiyu
    Recently, the reporter spent three months completing a trip to Southern Manchuria. Since the Democratic Allied Forces withdrew from Southern Manchuria last year for the sake of peace and forbearance, the people of Southern Manchuria have once again been plunged into the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek's "Second Manchuria." Today, I have seen them again.

    In May, as we followed the retreating Chiang army from Huai'de to Gongzhuling, we arrived at the home of a farmer surnamed Sun. He grabbed my hand and said, "Last year, during the Battle of Siping, I drove a cart to help you for forty days. A Kuomintang shell killed one of my horses. I sent you to Dehui, and before leaving, you got me a horse from the cavalry unit to compensate." Later, in his courtyard near the stable, he introduced us to his white-haired, elderly mother. She warmly called out, "You are comrades from the XX regiment!" She had been remembering this unit number for the past year. When I asked her, "Where is the horse?" she looked at the stable with disappointment and said, "The 'calamity' army took it away... this time it's all over."

    After crossing the Songhua River, I arrived in the granary area of ​​Northeast China. It was the season when the liberated areas were deeply engaged in land struggle and intensifying spring plowing, and the countryside had regained a busy and joyful atmosphere. However, in the newly liberated areas of Gongzhuling, Changtu, Kaiyuan, and Siping, I personally witnessed hunger. A weak woman, holding a baby in one arm and supporting herself on a cart with the other, squeezed through the crowd to receive the grain distributed by the Democratic Allied Forces. Little girls crowded under the legs of adults, reaching out their small hands to pick up the soybeans that fell on the ground. A carter wiped sweat from his forehead, looked at the Kuomintang planes strafing and slaughtering the grain distribution crowd in the sky. He did not dodge, but showed a joyful smile, because before this moment they had faced a destruction even more terrifying than this; the Kuomintang was killing people with hunger. A middle-aged man with bloodshot eyes told me: "Comrade! If I hadn't received three 'shi' (a unit of dry measure) of grain from Changtu Station, my family of six would have starved to death."

    One evening, we stayed at the home of an old man. He was a happy and stubborn man. In his daughter's words: "The best! The old man... when he had six mules in hand, he would shout and no one would dare to move." But this year, he had fallen into an abyss of pain. He was a rich peasant and also a head of the village (牌长). But he pointed to the newly installed wooden door and angrily denounced Chiang Kai-shek's rule. This door alone cost one thousand five hundred yuan. Everyone had to pay for an ID card. There was a house tax for houses and a land tax for land. Taxes were levied on cows, donkeys, and horses. Even Chiang Kai-shek's birthday required contributions! People were conscripted to Kaiyuan to build fortifications, even women went to Northeast Village to work for three days, and they had to bring their own dry food. As the head of the village, the county often came to conscript soldiers. If the conscripts ran away, they would nail him down and demand people. He certainly told us, "The Kuomintang cannot win the world. They are full of evil and have gone too far." Speaking of conscription, another farmer, Yuan Zhenhai, also told us that his young son broke his foot and was tied up and sent to the county to draw lots for conscription. Fortunately, he was not selected. Two days ago, they came to ask for people again. The village chief said he had to go. "This time is really good," Yuan Zhenhai bowed to us and said, "No need to go again."

    At Kaiyuan Station, two days before our arrival, a person hanged himself because the Kuomintang was conscripting soldiers. While we were chasing the enemy on the China Changchun Railway, we cooked in a peasant's home. The villager tearfully told us that the landlord's only son was taken away by the Kuomintang. He searched everywhere but could not find him. Instead, he was shot twice. When he returned home, he stabbed himself in the stomach with a sharp knife, but he did not die. He then asked his family to strangle him, but the whole family cried and refused. Finally, he pulled out his intestines and killed himself.

    Such conscription was already miserable enough, but I also collected an incomplete material on the Kuomintang army's oppression of the people: In Menlian Village, Xingyu District, Qingyuan County, there are seven small villages, with a total of about 800 people. In addition to the national tax, provincial tax, and county tax they had to pay, there were many additional burdens. They supported twenty-one "self-defense team members", the village head, four people for communication, reporting, and clerical work, five people from the financial cooperative department, one squad leader (specially sent out as a scout), five people from the military police inspection office, thirteen patrolmen were set up in the village, and there were also four plainclothes intelligence agents in the village office, supporting a total of fifty-three people. In addition, buying a dozen guns cost 510,000 yuan. Building bunkers in the Caoshi Tumenzi area required Menlian Village to provide sixty-five workers every day, and also bear three hundred catties of cement, 250,000 bricks, eight hundred catties of iron wire, one hundred wooden boards, six hundred eight-foot-long tree poles, one hundred carts of roadblocks, and sixty two-zhang long six-inch diameter logs. A unit of the transportation regiment of the Kuomintang New Sixth Army stationed in Menlian Village for two months, and had to supply thirty 'shi' of soybeans, twenty 'shi' of sorghum, three 'shi' of rice, twenty fat pigs (chickens were impossible to calculate), 20,000 catties of grass, and also bore 2,500 sleepers when repairing the railway. A rural village was overwhelmed by such a huge number of support payments.

    In addition to this, Menlian Village also bore the same humiliation and ravage as other places under the rule of "Second Manchuria," that is, forty women were raped. If they resisted the ravages of this group of "beasts," then they would put grenades under the pot and set fire to the houses...

    While chasing the remnants of the enemy on the China Changchun Railway, we met an old farmer. He was leading the way for the Democratic Allied Forces. He quietly asked me, "After distributing the grain, will they also distribute the land?" After I introduced him to the situation in the liberated areas, he smiled and said to me confidentially, "We already knew that!" The people of Southern Manchuria, who suffered unparalleled disasters under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's "Second Manchuria," had long been expecting the return of the Democratic Allied Forces from their tears.

### 重获解放的南满人民　南满纪行

　　重获解放的南满人民
  　南满纪行
    刘白羽
    记者最近以三个月的时间，完成了南满之行。从去年民主联军为了和平忍让撤离南满以后，南满的人民又深陷于蒋介石黑暗的“二满洲”的统治下，今天我又重见到他们了。
    当五月间我们顺着怀德到公主岭，追击溃退蒋军的时候，我们到了一个姓孙的农民家里，他拉住我手说：“去年四平作战，我赶了大车帮助你们四十天，国民党的炮弹把我的一匹马打死了，我送你们到了德惠，临走你们从骑兵队拉一匹马赔给我”。后来他在他院里马厩边把我们介绍给他那白发缤纷的老母亲，她亲热的叫着：“你们就是××团的同志啦”，她一年来是一直记着这个番号的。当我问她：“马呢”，她懊丧的望着马厩说：“给‘遭殃’军拉去了……这回是完蛋了”。
    在越过松花江以后，我到了东北谷仓地带，那正是解放区深入土地斗争加紧春耕，农村又获得忙碌而愉快的季节，可是在新解放的公主岭、昌图、开原、四平一带，我却亲眼看见了饥饿；一个病弱的女人手抱着婴儿，一手扶着车挤着去领民主联军分给的粮食，小姑娘们挤在大人腿下伸出小手拾起落在地下的黄豆，一个赶大车的车夫，从额头上擦一把汗，看看在天空“卡卡”扫射屠杀分粮群众的国民党飞机，他不躲避，他却露出欢愉的微笑，因为在这一刻以前他们有着比这还可怕的毁灭；国民党正在用饥饿杀人。一个眼膜发红的中年人告诉我：“同志！要不是我从昌图站分到了三石粮，一家六口人可就要饿死。”
    又一个晚上，我们住在一个老头家里，他是一个快乐而倔强的人，用他女儿的话来形容：最好了，她说：“老头……六匹骡子揽在手里叱一声，谁也不敢动”，可是这一年他却沉落在痛苦的深渊了，他是一个富农，而且是一个牌长，但是他指着那新按的木板门向我痛骂起蒋介石的统治；光这个门就花了一千五百元，人人都要缴身份证，房有房捐，地有地税，牛驴马都上捐，连蒋介石做什么寿还要派款呢！抓人到开原去修工事，连妇女也到东北村去修了三天，而且还要自己带干粮去；他当牌长，县上常来抓壮丁，壮丁跑了就钉住他要人，他肯定对我们说：“国民党得不了天下的，他们恶贯满盈了，真做的太绝了”。提起抓兵，另一个农民袁振海又告诉和他的小儿子摔坏了脚，被捆着送上县里去抽签挑兵，幸而未抽上，前二天又来要人，村长说还得去，“这回可大善了”，袁振海向我们迎头作了个揖，说“不用再去”了。
    在开原站，我们到达前两日就有一个人因为国民党抓壮丁，自己吊死了。我们在中长路上追击敌人时，在一个老百姓家里烧饭吃，老乡含着泪告我们，房东老头子的独生子给国民党拉走，他四出寻找没有找到，反挨了两枪，回家他用一把尖刀插到肚里，但没有死，他又要求家里人把他勒死，全家嚎啕大哭，不肯给他，终于他自己把肠子掏出来自杀死了。
    这样抓兵已经够惨了，但是我还收集到蒋军压榨人民一份不完整的材料：清原县兴隅区的门帘村，有七个小屯，共约八百余人，他们除去要缴纳的国税、省税、县税之外，还有额外的许多负担，他们供养着二十一个“自卫队员”，屯长，通讯、汇报，文书等四人，金融合作部五人，还供养分队长（专门出去作探子）一人，军警纠察处五人，村设盘道员十三人，村公所还有四个便衣谍报员，共供养五十三人，此外买枪十几支，花费五十一万元。草市土门子一带修碉堡，门帘村每天要出六十五个工，还负担三百斤洋灰，二十五万块砖，八百斤铁丝，一百块木板，六百根八尺长的树杆，一百车鹿砦，六十根二丈长六寸直径的木料，国民党新六军运输团一部在门帘村驻札两月，又要供给三十石黄豆，二十石高粱，三石大米，二十口肥猪，（鸡无法计算），二万斤谷草，在修铁路时还负担了二千五百根枕木。一个农村就这样庞大的供养数字所压倒了。
    除此而外，门帘村还担负了同其他“二满洲”统治下地方同样的污辱与蹂躏，即就是四十个妇女的被强奸，如果反抗他们这一群“野兽”的蹂躏，那末他们就会把手榴弹塞到锅底下，把火弄到房屋上了……。
    追击中长路上残敌时，我们遇到一个老农民，他是当地给民主联军带路的，他悄悄问我：“分了粮还分地不？”当我把解放区情形介绍给他以后，他随即就笑嘻嘻的机密的对我说：“我们早就知道了”！在蒋介石“二满洲”统治下受到无比的灾难的南满人民早就从泪行中期望着民主联军再度的来临了。
