　　Good News of Counter-Offensive Victories Spreads Throughout Villages in Qin County and Qin Yuan
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue, 9th Dispatch] Qin County, Qin Yuan, Changzi, and other counties have launched a mass-based counter-offensive propaganda campaign. Students from "Qintun Middle School" and various elementary schools in Qin County have spontaneously formed costumed propaganda teams to spread the news of the great counter-offensive victories everywhere. In addition, the "blackboard newspapers" in each village and the "family blackboard newspapers" in each household are all writing about the news of the great counter-offensive victory. Under this propaganda, in the Third District alone, 210 new male and female militia members were added in ten days. The masses in Dongduanzhuang in the Fourth District wrote mutual guarantees to the front and rear. Li Haizhu, the branch secretary, volunteered to work twenty days a month for the militiamen and laborers on the expedition. Under his influence, the entire village dedicated five-thirds of their labor to the expeditionary militiamen and laborers. Qin Yuan and Changzi held separate victory celebration meetings. More than 3,000 people from Chengguan, Beiyuan, Hanhonggou, Siwei Village, Wangjiayuan, Muhuayuan, and other villages in Qin Yuan held a celebration meeting in Chengguan, decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and hung flags for commemoration. At night, there was a torchlight parade with drums and music, and everyone was jubilant, and continued to carry out the great counter-offensive propaganda.
