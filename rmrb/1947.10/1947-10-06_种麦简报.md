　　Wheat Planting Briefs
　　[Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] The masses at the Longhua base point in the Fifth District correctly recognize the famine and are rushing to plant wheat in the fields. In the seven administrative villages, the rainfall was the latest, and the earliest millet could not be harvested until August 25th, and the late millet until early September 10th. But the season waits for no one. The masses discussed the solar terms and immediately took action. In five days, they inter-planted wheat on 5,100 mu of farmland. The masses in Longhua Village and Qi Village repaired twenty one-legged drills and twelve two-legged drills. After the poor peasants cleared their thinking, they took action. After clearing the thinking of the middle peasants, they planned to inter-plant all the fields that could be inter-planted with wheat by August 25th.

　　[Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] The masses in Mengjiazhuang Village in the Seventh District recognize that this year's famine is serious and that all wheat fields that can be planted must be planted with wheat. The masses said: The late millet fields this year must be inter-planted with wheat. The following are several methods to ensure seedling establishment: (1) Plant wheat in the millet ridges. After the millet is ripe and harvested, pull out the millet stubble and deeply hoe the wheat seedlings once. (2) When the ground thaws next February, the ground can be harrowed. (3) Take advantage of the current moist soil and plant wheat. According to past experience, this does not necessarily result in a lower wheat yield. The masses said: This is "one effort, two gains." (Shi Qun, Feng Shan)
　　[Our Newspaper, Changzhi News] After the rectification of mutual aid in the Fourth District, the wheat fields in the entire district increased from 5,280 mu to 9,076.6 mu, an increase accounting for 40.4% of the total wheat fields. The average application of manure per mu is about 50 dan. The main reason for the rapid sowing this time is that there is a plan and a division of labor. Huo Village originally had 135 mu of regular-cropping wheat fields and prepared to change the cropping on 148 mu. Now, both the changed-cropping and regular-cropping fields have been completely planted. When they were planting, they calculated the land, labor, and livestock, determined the time, and all men and women, full and half laborers, went to the fields to implement a division of labor. Full laborers carried manure and fetched water, half laborers led livestock, and women cut sorghum and dug yam potatoes. They used encouragement and rewards to give play to the enthusiasm of each laborer. (Li Feng)
　　[Our Newspaper, Wu'an News] The Eighth District has a total of 126,330 mu of land and plans to plant wheat on one-half of it. According to statistics on September 20th, 23,537 mu have been inter-planted with wheat and 3,893 mu have been plowed and planted with wheat. In Chongyi Village alone, 1,500 mu of wheat have been inter-planted, and it is planned to plant another 2,000 mu by plowing, exceeding the original plan by 500 mu. After hearing the news of the counter-offensive, the masses in Jialidian Village in the Second District proposed "Plant more wheat to capture Chiang Kai-shek," planning to plant at least 700 mu of wheat in the entire village of 1,400 mu. In order to rush to plant wheat fields, the masses in Shili Village cut grain during the day and carried it at night. Shangtuancheng Village planned to plant 2,634 mu of wheat, and by the 19th, 2,008 mu had been inter-planted. The Fourth District stipulated that each person should inter-plant at least 1.5 mu of wheat, plow and plant 0.5 mu of wheat, plus 0.4 mu of wheat in paddy fields (totaling 2.4 mu). (Long Hai, Han Huan)
　　[Our Newspaper, Shexian News] On September 22nd, the Seventh District convened a joint meeting of village cadres and elementary school teachers to study the expansion of wheat fields. Each village made a plan. Finally, the District Chief made a district-wide plan based on the plans of each village. The district has 1,723.8 mu of paddy fields and 11,181.2 mu of dry land. In previous years, 1,523 mu of wheat were planted in paddy fields and 7,710.4 mu were planted in dry land. This year, 1,612 mu will be planted in paddy fields and 8,918.6 mu will be planted in dry land, 1,273.9 mu more than in previous years. The area planted with wheat accounts for 81% of the total land in the district. In the past, wheat fields were sometimes not fertilized, but this year, each mu of wheat field can be fertilized with an average of 20 dan. (Seventh District Correspondent Group)
