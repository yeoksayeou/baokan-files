Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—The Shanghai China U.S. Evening Post disclosed on the 27th of last month: Under the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been terrified and is making defensive preparations everywhere. It is said that the Chiang bandit Executive Yuan has ordered all cities to be fortified, with city walls, bunkers, and forts to be built. City walls destroyed by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance should be repaired immediately, with a minimum height of six meters and a thickness of forty meters from the base to the top of the wall. A side-defense bunker should be built every three hundred meters. The entire county should take the county seat as its core, with fortifications and earthen walls especially strengthened within four kilometers outside the city, densely arranged to protect the county seat. The moat dug outside the city should be eight meters wide and three meters deep. The city should prepare three months' worth of food and fuel, and three months' worth of ammunition for emergencies. Three thousand sacks should also be stored in the city to block the city gates. Furthermore, "county heads" and "mayors" are strictly ordered to supervise "special self-defense forces" in carrying out city defense drills, ready to defend the city at any time. Important townships without forts should build them immediately, and all townships should build bunkers. Each village should construct earthen walls and outer moats, and implement joint defense in all villages. The Chiang bandit government strictly limits the completion of this project by the end of this year, and lists the completion of this task as 30% of the annual "county head" performance assessment. This shows that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's panic over the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive has increased more and more.

　　蒋匪恐慌益甚下令修设城防
    【新华社陕北十三日电】沪华美晚报上月二十七日披露：在人民解放军大举反攻下，已使蒋家匪帮丧魂落魄、到处作防御准备。据称：蒋匪行政院已下令城市一律设防，修筑城垣碉堡、卫寨，规定抗战期间被日寇破坏之城墙即日赶修，由城脚至城头最低六公尺，厚四十公尺。每隔三百公尺建筑侧防碉堡一座。全县以县城为核心，城外四公里内，特别加强碉堡土围工事，周围密布，以拱卫县城。城外所掘城壕阔八公尺，深三公尺，城内准备食粮燃料三个月，及弹药三个月之需用数量，以备不测。城内并储存麻袋三千只，备以堵塞城门。并严令“县长”“市长”须督促“特种自卫队作守城演习，随时作守城准备。”重要乡镇如无卫寨，即须建筑卫寨，所有乡镇概筑碉堡。每村均构筑土围外壕，各乡村实行联防。蒋匪政府严限此项工程于本年底完成，并把此项任务之完成与否，列为全年“县长”成绩考核额百分之三十。显示蒋家匪帮对人民解放军反攻之恐慌，已愈益增长。
