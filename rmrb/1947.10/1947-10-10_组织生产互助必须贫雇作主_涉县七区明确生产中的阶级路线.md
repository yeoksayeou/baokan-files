　　Organizing Production and Mutual Aid Must Rely on Poor and Hired Peasants
　　Seventh District of She County Clarifies the Class Line in Production
　　[Report from this newspaper in She County] The Seventh District held a village cadre meeting on the 22nd of last month to summarize production and study the organizational line for production mutual aid. It was determined that success depends on relying on the poor and hired peasants as the mainstay, and uniting with the middle peasants. For example, in Baituan Village, when mutual aid was initiated this spring, the poor and hired masses were not enthusiastic. After an inspection, it was found that seven households, including poor and hired peasants Niu Fubao, had no food to eat, some poor and hired peasants still had no houses to live in, and some landlords still lived in tall buildings. In response to the demands of the masses, a re-examination was conducted, and the poor and hired peasants were allocated grain, houses, and farm tools. The masses' enthusiasm for production immediately increased. Niu Fubao was actively involved in production, and the masses elected him as the leader of the large group. In terms of leadership, the poor and hired peasants were grasped as the backbone, the mutual aid groups in the whole village were reorganized, and forty-one landlord households were expelled. During the seedling weeding summary, forty-four model workers were selected, the vast majority of whom were poor and hired peasants. In addition, there were individual villages where the class line was not clear in production mutual aid. For example, in Chen Mashuan's group in Hezhang Village, before the rectification of mutual aid, papermaking earned a total of 300,000 yuan, and after calculating the accounts, the landlord received 200,000 yuan; as a result, the poor and hired peasants suffered a great loss and were not enthusiastic about mutual aid. After this problem was discovered, the cadres and the masses realized that production should benefit the poor and hired peasants, and should not allow landlords to exploit loopholes. As a result, feudal landlords were squeezed out, and now the masses are more enthusiastic about papermaking.
　　[Another report] In summarizing production, the Seventh District examined the issue of awarding merit in past production leadership and clarified the questions of who should be awarded merit and for whom merit should be awarded. Non-class viewpoints in past merit awarding were liquidated. For example, individual villages in the past awarded merit to landlords, which boosted the landlords' prestige and stimulated the emotions of the peasants. Some villages also regarded awarding merit as a means to promote work. For example, the main cadres of Taicang, Taizhuang and other villages saw that a certain member of the mutual aid group was not active, so they mobilized other group members to award him a merit, attempting to stimulate him to become active. As a result, there was disagreement among the merit awards, causing disunity among the peasants. Since the rectification of mutual aid and weeding seedlings, the villages have carried out class-based merit awarding campaigns. The main method is to discuss among cadres and poor and hired peasants who should be awarded merit and for whom merit should be awarded. An old man over sixty years old in Baituan said: "Awarding merit is for us to make a good life, we must work hard to produce and strive for merit." Cadres in Taizhuang, Baituan, and Xijun said: "We must perform meritorious service for the people." We must not allow landlords to be awarded merit to undermine the morale of the peasants, but must mobilize the emancipated peasants to actively engage in production and become prosperous in order to strive for merit." Under this policy, each village carried out class education among the emancipated masses, inspiring enthusiasm for production to get rich, and striving for merit. Therefore, a total of 220 heroes were selected in the whole region, 173 of whom were poor and hired peasants, 42 were old and middle peasants, and 5 were new rich peasants. Facts have proved that villages that carry out production with the poor and hired peasants as the mainstay and unite with the middle peasants are active. For example, in Taicang, Baituan, Taizhuang and other villages, 90% of the households and 100% of the labor force (excluding landlords) are organized.

　　组织生产互助必须贫雇作主
  　涉县七区明确生产中的阶级路线
    【本报涉县讯】七区上月二十二日开村干会，总结生产，研究出生产互助的组织路线，必须以贫雇为主，团结中农，才能搞好。如白芟村今年春天发动互助时，贫雇群众不起劲，检查了一下，贫雇牛福保等七户没有粮食吃，有些贫雇还没有房子住，有些地主还住的高楼房；适应群众要求复查了一下，贫雇分到了粮食房子农具，群众生产情绪马上提高。牛福保生产积极群众选他为大组长。在领导方面，抓住了贫雇为骨干，整顿了全村互助组，开除地主四十一户。在锄苗总结时选出模范四十四名，绝大多数是贫雇。另外有个别村庄在生产互助当中对阶级路线不明确，如合漳村陈马栓组，在未整顿互助以前，造纸共赚洋三十万元，算了算帐地主就分了二十万元；结果贫雇吃了大亏，互助不起劲。自这问题发现后，干部和群众都认识了生产应当叫贫雇得利，不应当叫地主钻空子，结果挤出了封建地主，现在群众造纸更起劲。
    【又讯】七区在总结生产中，检查了过去一段生产领导中的立功问题，明确认识了谁来立功，为谁立功的问题。清算了过去立功中非阶级观点。如过去有个别村庄给地主立功，这样树立地主威信，刺激了农民情绪。还有部分村庄立功当作是推动工作的手腕，如太苍、台庄等村×××主要干部，在互助小组里看到某组员不积极，便动员其他组员给立一功，企图以此来刺激他积极起来。结果形成立功中互相不服气，造成农民之间不团结。整顿互助锄苗以来，各村开展阶级性的立功运动，其主要方法，在干部贫雇里讨论了立功是为谁让谁来立功。白芟六十余岁老汉说：“立功是为咱发时光，咱要努力生产来争取立功。”台庄、白芟、西峻干部说：“咱要为民立功。”可不能让地主立功来打击农民情绪，要发动翻身农民积极起来生产发家争取立功。”在这一方针下，各村都在翻身群众里贯彻了阶级教育，启发起发家生产积极性，争取立功。因此，全区共选出功臣二百二十个，贫雇一百七十三个，老中农四十二个，新富农五个。事实证明，凡是这样以贫雇为主团结中农进行生产的村，就表现活跃，如太苍、白芟、台庄等村，百分之九十的户数，百分之百的劳力组织起来（除地主以外）。
