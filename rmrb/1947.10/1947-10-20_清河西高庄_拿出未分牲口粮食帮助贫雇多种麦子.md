(Jinan, Hebei, October 18th) Xigaozhuang Village, Qinghe District, is using the fruits of struggle to solve the difficulties faced by poor peasants in planting wheat. The village confiscated a large number of farm tools and wheat from landlords during the struggle, as well as eight oxen and two donkeys. However, as it was time to plant wheat, these had not yet been distributed. Many poor peasants said, "We don't have wheat seeds or fertilizer, so we won't plant wheat!" "Even if we did, it wouldn't be enough, so we'll plant less!" Based on the feedback from the masses, the cadres immediately held a meeting to discuss the issue. They all felt that not being able to plant wheat would negate the meaning of liberation. After discussion, they decided to first lend 180 jin of wheat to 11 poor peasant families, including Li Junkui, and distribute and lend the 100,700 jin of fertilizer they had purchased to 15 poor peasant families, including Zhang Xuelin. They also lent livestock to poor households without livestock. They also intensified ideological mobilization, putting forward the slogan: "Plant and reap, one wheat harvest equals three autumns!" Furthermore, addressing the mindset of some poor peasants who relied on the fruits of the struggle to get by, they proposed: "Struggle for liberation, plant wheat to prosper!" They called on poor and middle peasants to intensify mutual aid to plant more wheat. A total of over 120 people in the village formed 11 mutual aid groups, with livestock properly allocated to each group. The planting difficulties of military dependents, the elderly, the weak, and orphans were resolved through mutual assistance. A surge of plowing, harrowing, and fertilizer spreading ensued. The whole village was bustling with activity, with people calling out to each other non-stop. The group led by Wu Baozhu and Yu Changshan delivered over 50 cartloads of fertilizer a day. The three mu of land belonging to Liu Xiyi, a military dependent, were quickly fertilized. At this time, after comparing mutual aid with non-mutual aid, those who had not participated in mutual aid were busy looking for mutual aid partners, further advancing the development of mutual aid. In addition to stepping up their efforts in picking cotton, harvesting autumn crops, spinning, and making cotton clothes, the women also made 40 pairs of anti-aggression shoes in ten days. Now, Xigaozhuang Village is filled with the joy of labor everywhere. As they say, "We poured out our bitterness during the night struggles, and now we feel comfortable working during the day." The women say, "Busy at night, busy during the day, our hearts are happy and our bodies are not tired." The men say, "In the past, we didn't have oxen to plant wheat, and we had to beg the landlords, but they wouldn't lend them to us. This time, the oxen belong to us poor people, so we're going to plant more wheat!"

(Jinan, Hebei, October 18th) After the issuance of loans in Lianzhu and Malantou Villages, Sixth District of Qi County, poor people are buying oxen to plant wheat. Fan Qinghe of Lianzhu Village said: "Last year, I only cultivated one and a half mu of land. This time, I got a loan and bought an ox with Dongsheng and Lianyuan, making it easier to plant wheat. I can plant 12 mu." Fan Jingzhong said: "I haven't raised livestock in 20 years. This year, I got a loan and have livestock, so I'm going to plant wheat on all 13 mu of my land." Fan Qingjun didn't have livestock to plant wheat last year and had aching legs and a sore back from digging the land every day. This year, he got a loan and bought an ox with Chunjiang. Their four families will plant wheat on all 50 mu of their land. It is estimated that since the issuance of loans, the village has bought 12 oxen and planted wheat on 4.8 hectares. Thirty-two poor peasant households in Malantou Village borrowed one million yuan in loans and bought ten oxen, so all the poor peasants in the village have oxen to use. The masses said, "This year, the land is good, and the government has given us loans. Now that we have oxen, we can plant a lot more wheat!" Currently, the poor peasants in the village are concentrating all their efforts on plowing and fertilizing the land.

(Jinan, Hebei, October 18th) Xixiao District, Sixth District of Linzhang, men and women are helping each other to turn wasteland into wheat fields. This movement started in Xianwu Village, where village cadres took the lead in mutual aid, plowing and harrowing the land while mobilizing for mutual aid. After mobilization, all the men, women, old, and young in the village, except for those left to look after the children and cook, participated in mutual aid in the fields. A total of 160 people were divided into five large groups, each large group divided into three small groups, democratically electing group leaders, and forming a production committee to lead the autumn sowing and autumn plowing. Li Dequan's group made a good start, with 11 people plowing three and a half mu of land and harrowing it twice in half a day. In two and a half days, the whole village cut 285 mu of weeds, plowed 360 mu of land (81 people plowed 25 mu), and hauled 97 cartloads of crops. The masses in the village were extremely excited, saying, "Our village has 30 hectares of land, but 16 hectares were abandoned this spring because we didn't have livestock. If we had known about mutual aid earlier, we wouldn't have abandoned so much!" "We must resolutely struggle against the landlords and resolutely struggle against the wasteland, turning the wasteland into wheat fields."

    【本报冀南十八日电】企之六区连珠、马兰头村发贷款后，贫民买牛种麦。连珠村范清河说：“去年才挖了亩半地，这回贷了款，和东生、连元伙买了牛，种麦方便了，俺可种上十二亩。”范景仲说：“我二十年没喂过牲口，今年贷了款，有了牲口，俺十三亩地都要种上麦子。”范清俊去年种麦没牲口，天天掘地掘的腿痛腰酸，今年贷了款，和春江伙买了牛，他四家五十亩地，全部种上麦子。计该村自发放贷款后，共买了十二头牛，种麦四顷八十亩。马兰头村三十二户贫农，借了一百万元贷款，买了十头牛，全村贫农都有了牛用，群众说：“今年垧又好，政府又贷给咱款，买了牛可多多种麦吧。”现该村贫农正集中全力翻地送粪。
    【本报冀南十八日电】临漳六区西小区，男女互助，变荒地为麦田。这一运动由显五村开始，该村村干带头互助，一面犁耙地，一面进行互助动员。经过动员后，全村男女老幼除留看小孩做饭人外，全部劳力都参加了互助下地。计一百六十人，共分五大组，每大组分三小组，民主选出组长，并产生出生产委员会领导秋种秋耕。李德全组打响了头一炮，十一个人，半天拉犁犁地三亩半，还耙了两遍。全村两天半共割荒草二百八十五亩，犁地三百六十亩（八十一人拉犁二十五亩），拉庄稼九十七车。全村群众异常兴奋，都说：“咱村三十顷地，因没有牲口，今春荒了十六顷，早知道互助，可荒不了这些啦！”“咱们给地主斗争，又要坚决给荒地斗争，把荒草地变为麦田。”
