Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 5th. Chiang bandits, long besieged in Yongnian under the threat of panic and starvation, attempted to break out last night at midnight, led by bandit chiefs Wang Zemin and Xu Tieying (nicknamed "Iron Grinder Head"). The besieging troops immediately met them head-on and annihilated over 700 of them, and then, capitalizing on the victory, liberated Yongnian City in one fell swoop. Over a hundred enemies fled in disarray to Zhanggu, more than thirty miles west of the city, and we are currently pursuing and annihilating them. Preliminary battle results: seized two heavy machine guns, eighteen light machine guns, and over four hundred rifles. According to reports, Wang and Xu are both local habitual bandits who, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, attached themselves to the Japanese invaders and harmed the local area for many years, killing countless people. When the Japanese invaders surrendered two years ago, they were unexpectedly appointed as "vanguard troops" by the Chiang bandits. Yongnian refused to surrender, and the city was subsequently besieged by our local militia and armed forces. The people of the city, who have been harmed by these bandits for two years, have now seen the light of day.

　　我解放永年城
  　匪突围未逞被歼七百
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫五日电】在恐慌与饥饿威胁下久困永年之蒋匪，于昨晚午夜，在匪首王泽民、许铁英（外号铁磨头）率领下企图突围，被围困部队当即迎头痛击，聚歼其七百余人，并乘胜一举解放永年城。歼敌百余狼狈逃窜城西三十余里之张固，我正追歼中。初步战果：缴重机枪两挺，轻机枪十八挺，步枪四百余支。按王、许均为当地惯匪，抗战中依附日寇危害地方多年，杀人无算。前年日寇投降时竟被蒋匪委为“先遣军”，永年拒不缴械，该城遂被我民兵地方武装所围困。现被该匪残害两年之该城民众，已得见天日。
