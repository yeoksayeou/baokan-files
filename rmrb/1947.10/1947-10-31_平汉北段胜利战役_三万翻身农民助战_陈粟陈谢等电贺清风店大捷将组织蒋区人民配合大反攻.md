Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 29th. During the recent Pinghan Northern Section Campaign, over 30,000 liberated peasants from central Hebei Province, carrying over 3,000 stretchers and over 1,000 carts, went to the front lines to assist the People's Liberation Army in combat. Over 3,000 elite militiamen from counties such as Qingyuan and Renqiu bravely participated in sabotage, and in just three days, they had fragmented the KMT bandits' northern section of the Pinghan Railway. Over 3,000 people from Anxin repaired eleven large bridges overnight in the mud to facilitate the passage of carts. More than 400 stretchers from Gaoyang were led to the front lines by Communist Party members. 162 of these were trained for eight days before the expedition and held field exercises. The militiamen had basic military and stretcher-bearing knowledge, and their discipline during the march was good. The liberated peasant stretcher-bearers from Xiyan Village in Gaoyang firmly guaranteed to keep the wounded stable and comfortable when going uphill and over ditches, and to hide the wounded first when airplanes came. The militiamen believed that going to the front to carry the wounded was the most glorious thing, and many militiamen even proposed to stay with the army for a long time to assist in the battle, saying, "We will not go home until we defeat old Chiang."
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Su-Lu-Yu-Wan, 29th. Generals Chen, Su, Tang, and others have sent a telegram congratulating the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army on the great victory at Qingfengdian, stating: "To General Nie Rongzhen and all commanders and fighters: After the recent recapture of Rongcheng, Xiongxian, Xinzhen, and Baxian, another great victory has been won near Qingfengdian. The achievements are glorious and great. Our East China Liberation Army is encouraged by the victory and will definitely work harder to annihilate the enemy and organize the people in the KMT-occupied areas to cooperate with the victorious counter-offensive of the national liberation army. We hereby send a telegram of congratulations and condolences."
