　　Logarithms and Their Uses
  　Compiled by Gao Yiping
    (Taihang Industrial Series, No. 3)
    Mr. Gao Yiping, the compiler of this book, has used his experience as a middle school mathematics teacher for more than ten years to introduce the relatively difficult-to-understand logarithms in a popular way. From the simple to the profound, from the specific to the principles, the examples are exhaustive, and the explanations are clear and detailed. Anyone with a slight mathematical foundation can understand it without a teacher. Therefore, this book is not only necessary for practical work, but also can be used as teaching material for schools and self-study for cadres.
