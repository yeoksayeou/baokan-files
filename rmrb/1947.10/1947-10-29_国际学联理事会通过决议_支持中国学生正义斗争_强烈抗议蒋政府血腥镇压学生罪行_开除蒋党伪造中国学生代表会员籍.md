Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th (Delayed News): The All-China Students' Federation Council's "Resolution on China" is as follows:

“First, the All-China Students' Federation should immediately protest the Kuomintang government's oppression of the Chinese student movement, arresting and massacring innocent students, depriving students of their freedom, and their basic living conditions.

The All-China Students' Federation should further demand that the Kuomintang government immediately release all arrested students and professors, immediately cease fascist terror, and guarantee that such terror will not happen again.

Second, urge American student groups to pay attention after the meeting to the various facts of the Chinese student situation—Chinese students are already angry because of American military support for Chiang Kai-shek; and take appropriate actions to alleviate this situation, especially to demand that the American government implement its declared policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs in order to alleviate this situation.

Third, the All-China Students' Federation calls on all peace-loving and democratic students in the world to use all possible means, such as sending protest letters and telegrams to the Kuomintang government, holding mass rallies, demonstrations, etc., to oppose the Chinese dictator—Chiang Kai-shek's arrest and massacre of Chinese students.

Fourth, when the Far East Student Conference convenes this November, send a delegation from the All-China Students' Federation to investigate the situation of Chinese students.

Fifth, expel the "Chinese National Student Association" from its group membership.

Sixth, the Council requests all group members to do their best to establish contact with democratic student groups in China and help them closely integrate with the All-China Students' Federation.

Seventh, the Council requests the Presidium to instruct the drafting committee to draft a public letter, which will be passed by the General Assembly and sent to the Chinese government, with a copy of the letter sent to the United Nations. This letter should strongly protest the Chinese government's dispatch of student delegations that are completely unrepresentative of Chinese students to participate in the All-China Students' Federation and the World Student Conference. This letter should also tell the Chinese government the All-China Students' Federation General Assembly's hatred for the anti-democratic measures taken by the government to oppress Chinese students (such as dissolving student organizations, bloody interference by military police in student parades and demonstrations, etc.).

The British representative's temporary motion: write to Chinese students to support their struggle.”

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th (Delayed News): The All-China Students' Federation's protest letter to the Kuomintang government is as follows:

“The All-China Students' Federation Council, representing 2.5 million students from democratic student organizations in 51 countries, hereby submits the following strong protests to your government regarding matters related to students and higher education:

First, we protest your government's policy of implementing civil war. This policy has ravaged your country to the point of near destruction after the just war against Japanese militarists ended. This policy hinders the restoration of national construction and the development of democratic educational facilities. We protest that your government's budget allocates less than 3 percent to education, while more than 80 percent is used for war; we protest the huge increase in tuition fees for institutions of higher learning, forcing many students to drop out of school. We believe that today your government's entire policy has led students into a situation of hunger and lack of equipment.

Second, we protest the methods your government has taken to deal with student demonstrations. Students around the world have the right to engage in activities to improve their lives, and they have the right to express their opinions on these matters. They have the right to work together to protect their rights and interests. We protest the widespread arrest of students and, even more, the persecution of peaceful student demonstrations with armed forces. We demand the immediate release of all arrested students, and all professors who have been dismissed for supporting students should be immediately reinstated.

Third, we protest your government's policy of obstructing the development of democratic student organizations. We demand the immediate lifting of all bans on student organizations, and no further action should be taken against democratic student organizations in the future.

Fourth, we protest your government's policy of obstructing any contact between Chinese democratic students and other democratic students in the world. We protest your government's attempt to deceive the All-China Students' Federation, an organization based on democratic student organizations in various countries, with a privately formed delegation. This delegation also attempted to make us believe that it was a representative of the so-called "Chinese National Student Association." Now we know that this organization is completely fabricated. However, your government has deceived us in this way; when we thought we had established contact with Chinese students, we were actually in contact with an anti-democratic government agency that was oppressing students who wanted to contact us.

We can assure your government that your policies will absolutely not succeed. Democratic students all over the world are determined to establish close and direct contact with Chinese students, and are determined to support their just and democratic demands for changing your government's policies.”

　　国际学联理事会通过决议
  　支持中国学生正义斗争
    强烈抗议蒋政府血腥镇压学生罪行
    开除蒋党伪造中国学生代表会员籍
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】（迟到消息）国际学联理事会“关于中国的决议”如左：
    “第一、国际学联应立即抗议国民党政府压迫中国学生运动，逮捕、屠杀无辜学生，取消学生自由，以及他们的生活基本条件。
    国际学联应进一步要求国民党政府立即释放一切被捕学生和教授，立即停止法西斯恐怖，并保证此类恐怖不再发生。
    第二、促使美国学生团体于会后注意中国学生情况的种种事实——中国学生已经因为美国军事支持蒋介石而愤怒了；并采取适当行动，以缓和此等情况，特别是要求美国政府实现它所宣布的不干涉中国内政的政策，以缓和此种情况。
    第三、国际学联号召世界一切爱好和平民主的学生，应用一切可能方法，例如致送抗议书和电报给国民党政府，举行群众大会、示威等，以反对中国独裁者——蒋介石逮捕和屠杀中国学生。
    第四、今年十一月远东学生大会开会时，派遣国际学联代表团前往调查中国学生的情况。
    第五、开除“中国大学生联合总会”的团体会员籍。
    第六、理事会要求一切团体会员尽力和中国的民主学生团体建立联系，并帮助他们与国际学联密切结合。
    第七、理事会要求主席团责成起草委员会草拟一公开信，并经大会通过，送交中国政府，并将该信副本一份送交联合国。这封信应强烈抗议中国政府派遣完全不能代表中国学生的学生代表团参加国际学联、世界学生大会。这封信并应告诉中国政府，国际学联大会对于该政府所采取的压迫中国学生的反民主措施的憎恨（如解散学生团体，军警血腥干涉学生游行示威等）。
    英国代表临时动议：给中国学生写信，支持他们的斗争。”
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】（迟到消息）国际学联致国民党政府抗议书如左：
    “国际学联理事会，代表五十一国民主学生组织的二百五十万学生，就有关学生与高等教育事宜向贵政府提出如下强烈抗议：
    首先，我们抗议贵政府实行内战的政策。这种政策在反抗日本军阀的正义战争结束之后，蹂躏贵国至濒于毁灭的程度。这种政策阻碍了国家建设的恢复与教育民主设施的发展。我们抗议贵政府预算中用于教育的不及百分之三，而用于战争的却高于百分之八十；我们抗议高等学校收费的庞大增加，迫使许多学生沦于失学。我们相信今天贵政府的全部政策，已经引致学生们进入一种饥饿与设备缺乏的处境。
    第二，我们抗议贵政府对付学生示威游行所采取的办法。全世界学生有权利为改进他们的生活而从事活动，他们有权表示他们对这些事情的意见。他们有权一起工作，以保护他们的权益。我们抗议广泛逮捕学生，更反对用武装部队迫害和平的学生示威。我们要求立即释放一切被捕的学生，一切为支持学生而被解聘的教授亦应立即恢复原职。
    第三，我们抗议贵政府阻扰学生民主团体发展的政策。我们要求立即取消对于学生团体所施行的一切禁令，今后不得采取行动对付民主学生团体。
    第四，我们抗议贵政府阻碍中国民主学生和世界其他民主学生之间的任何联系的政策。我们抗议贵政府企图以一个私人组成的代表团，来欺骗国际学联这样一个建立在各国民主学生团体基础上的组织。这个代表团还企图使我们相信它是一个所谓“中国大学生联合总会”的代表。现在我们已经知道这个组织完全是伪造的了。可是贵政府曾经这样欺骗了我们；当我们以为已经和中国学生取得联系的时候，实际上却是和一个正在压迫那些希望和我们联系的学生的一个反民主政府机关在联系。
    我们可以向贵政府保证：贵政府的政策绝对不会成功的。全世界的民主学生，决心和中国学生建立亲密的直接的联系，并且决心支持他们为着改变贵政府政策的正义的民主的要求。”
