　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: TASS, Prague, 3rd: This local "Rude Pravo" published Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov's interview with the newspaper's Sofia correspondent. The reporter asked: Does the current political situation have a tendency towards a new "Munich"? If so, what are the manifestations of these tendencies? Are there any similarities with the political situation in 1938? Dimitrov replied that the Munich of 1938 cannot be replayed in the same form because history does not repeat itself. In 1938, the hateful surrender of the French and British governments cleared the way for Hitler and fueled his ambition to dominate the world. Now, after defeating the German invaders (which was mainly won by the Soviet Union and the heroic Soviet army), a new imperialist war is being prepared in the world. The only difference is that in 1938, German imperialism held the initiative, while now the initiative is in the hands of American imperialism. Therefore, in the past, the leaders of France and Britain helped Hitler, and now they are helping Truman. But the ultimate goal is still the same, which is for one strong country to rule the world. Hitler used "anti-communism" as a smokescreen for his aggressive policy. However, the result of World War II was that communism did not fail, but its strength was greatly strengthened. Although these invaders are again using "anti-communism" as a smokescreen, they are obviously unable to create anything new to distinguish them from their German ancestors. The fundamental proposition of the United Nations, namely, the consistent resolution of peace and international security issues, has become a major obstacle to the new world domination ambitions. This is why American imperialists are striving to undermine the foundations of the United Nations.

　　Regarding the lineup of "pro-Munich" and "anti-Munich" forces, Dimitrov said: The situation in the Munich era is very different from the current situation, mainly as follows: First, the Soviet Union has high international prestige after this war, has great war experience, and its people are unswervingly united. Second, the Soviet Union has liberated many countries from fascist bondage. These countries have taken their destiny into their own hands and established people's democratic republics, with the Soviet Union at the head, forming the biggest obstacle to imperialist aggression and the main defender of peace. Third, the people of colonial countries have risen up in liberation wars against their oppressors; the struggle against imperialist oppressors is constantly developing. This fact has become a major obstacle to imperialist war plans. Fourth, the working people and democratic movements in all imperialist countries have greatly strengthened their forces during the war and are now increasingly becoming a major factor in defending peace. Fifth, the Communists, who showed particular heroism in the anti-fascist war and are now fully recognized by most democratic countries, actively participate in national construction and lead many governments. They have been able to unite democratic and progressive forces to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of their countries and stand at the forefront of defending world peace. Sixth, World War II has exposed the bankruptcy of capitalism and its anti-people nature, and millions of people clearly see that the victory of socialism is the only savior.

　　From the above, it is clear that the worldwide desire for peace and democracy is now stronger and more widespread than in 1938. Moreover, this desire is bound to develop increasingly, and the reactionary forces of imperialism are bound to fail. The result of this historical process development will inevitably guarantee future generations to obtain true peace, which depends on the unity of all freedom-loving people, and the common struggle of the working class, peasants, and intellectuals. Imperialists, especially the United States, believe that preparing for a new war of aggression, and first of all preparing for a war of aggression against the Soviet Union—the most powerful defender of peace—will help them avoid the impending economic crisis. The United States attempts to buy off those who see profit and forget righteousness with dollars, and threaten those who cannot be bought off with atomic bombs. American imperialists are trying their best to pave the way for themselves to rule the world; and ruling the world is impossible without resorting to war. As a result, they aided fascists and reactionary regimes, provided spiritual and material support to Greece and Turkey, were hostile to the new democracies of Eastern Europe, and at the same time actively carried out anti-communist struggles and launched an unbridled anti-Soviet offensive in the United States.

　　In answering Bulgaria's position in this struggle between "pro-Munich" and "anti-Munich" forces, Dimitrov said: All democratic people (including the Bulgarian people) must stand with the united forces of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union. Bulgaria must be an active rather than a passive factor in this struggle. This is determined by the interests of Bulgaria's survival and the necessity of consolidating the country's political and economic independence. Dimitrov said: Therefore, we must achieve the goals that we failed to achieve on the eve of World War II, must establish a strong united front of democratic peoples and countries to guarantee international cooperation, thwart the aggressive plans of imperialists, especially American monopoly capitalists, must expose their plans in various disguises, must wage a struggle against new war propaganda, and mobilize all democratic and progressive forces to achieve the final establishment of a truly lasting peace based on national equality and international cooperation.

### 季米特洛夫发表谈话：美反动派势必失败　保决与苏联及进步势力一起积极斗争挫败新战争煽动者

　　季米特洛夫发表谈话：
    美反动派势必失败
  　保决与苏联及进步势力一起积极斗争挫败新战争煽动者
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社布拉格三日讯：此间“鲁德·布拉窝报”发表保总理季米特洛夫接见该报驻索菲亚记者时的谈话。记者问：当前的政治局势是否有新“慕尼黑”的倾向？假如有，这些倾向的表现形式如何？与一九三八年的政治形势是否有相同之处？季氏答称：一九三八年的慕尼黑是不能以同一形式重演的，因为历史也不会重演。一九三八年，法英政府可恨的投降，为希特勒扫清了道路，并助长其统治世界的野心。现在，在战胜德寇（这主要是由苏联及英勇的苏军赢得的）以后，新的帝国主义战争又开始在世界上进行准备了，唯一的区别就是：一九三八年是德帝国主义掌握主动，而现在主动权则操在美帝国主义之手。因此，过去法、英两国的领袖们帮助希特勒，而现在它们则帮助杜鲁门。但是最终目的还是一样的，就是由一个强国来统治世界。希特勒以“反共产主义”为其侵略政策的烟幕，然而第二次世界大战的结果，共产主义并没有失败，而其力量却格外地加强了。虽然这些侵略者又再以“反共产主义”作为烟幕，但他们显然造不出什么新的东西使他们与他们的德国老祖宗有何区别。联合国组织的根本命题，即一致解决和平与国际安全问题，这成为新的世界统治野心家面前的重大障碍，这就是美帝国主义者何以力谋破坏联合国之基础的原因。
    关于“亲慕尼黑”势力与“反慕尼黑”势力的阵容问题，季米特洛夫说：慕尼黑时代的局势与当前的局势，有着极大的区别，主要如下：第一、苏联经过这次战争、已有高度的国际信誉，有伟大的战争经验，其人民不可动摇地团结一致。第二、苏联曾从法西斯羁绊之下解放了许多国家。这些国家已将人民的命运掌握在自己手中，并建立了人民的民主共和国，以苏联为首而构成了帝国主义侵略途中的最大障碍，而为和平的主要维护者。第三、殖民地国家的人民已在解放战争中崛起反对它们的压迫者；反对帝国主义压迫者的斗争，始终在发展中。此种事实，成为帝国主义战争计划的重大障碍。第四、一切帝国主义国家中的劳动人民与民主运动，在战争期间，已大大地加强了它们的力量，而且现正日益成为保卫和平的重大因素。第五、在反法西斯主义战争中表现特别英勇，而且现在大多数民主国家均予以充分承认的共产党人，积极参加建设国家，而且领导着许多政府，他们已能团结民主与进步的力量，来保障其国家的独立与主权，而且站在保卫世界和平的最前线。第六、第二次世界大战已暴露了资本主义的破产及其反人民的性质，千百万人民清楚地看到社会主义的胜利是唯一的救星。
    由上观之，明显的是：全世界要求和平与民主的愿望，现在比一九三八年来得更强烈而且更广泛了。尤有进者，此种愿望势必日益发展，而帝国主义的反动势力势必失败。这种历史进程发展的结果，必然保证后代子孙获得真正的和平，这有赖于一切爱好自由人民的团结，及劳动阶级、农民与知识分子的共同斗争。帝国主义者，特别是美国，认为准备新的侵略战争，而首先是准备侵略苏联——最强有力的和平的保卫者——的战争，将帮助他们避免行将到来的经济危机。美国企图以美元收买那些见利忘义者，并以原子弹来威胁那些不受收买者。美帝国主义者企图竭尽全力为他们自己铺设统治世界的道路；而统治世界若不诉诸战争，则不可能实现。结果，遂使他们援助法西斯分子及反动政权，在精神上与物质上支援希、土，敌视东欧国家的新民主，同时积极进行反共产主义斗争，并在美国进行肆无忌惮的反苏攻势。
    季氏在答复保国在这一“亲慕尼黑”与“反慕尼黑”势力斗争中所持的立场称：一切民主的人民（包括保国人民在内），必须与以苏联为首的和平及民主的联合势力站在一起，保加利亚在此一斗争中，必须是积极的而不是消极的因素，这是由保加利亚生存攸关的利益与巩固国家政治经济独立之必要性所规定的。季氏称：因此，我们必须要达到在第二次世界大战前夕我们所未能达到的目的，必须建立强大的民主人民与国家的联合阵线，以保证国际合作，挫败帝国主义、特别是美国垄断资本家的侵略计划，必须揭发他们在各种伪装下的计划，必须进行反对新战争宣传的斗争，动员一切民主与进步的力量，以达到最后建立以民族平等及国际合作为基础的真正持久和平。
