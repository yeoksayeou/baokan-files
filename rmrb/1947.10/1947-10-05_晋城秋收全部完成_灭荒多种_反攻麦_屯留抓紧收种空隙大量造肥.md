[This dispatch was sent from the Taiyue office of this newspaper on October 3rd] Jincheng, relying on the joint efforts of men and women, completed the autumn harvest in half a month, from the 10th to the 25th of last month, and is preparing to plant wheat. The 7th District originally planned to complete the harvest in 25 days, but as a result, all the grain was harvested in five days. Now they are making a concentrated effort to level the stubble and apply manure to eliminate mature wasteland. They are preparing to plant 20,000 mu more wheat than last year. In the 5th District, apart from those participating in the war and supporting the front, there are 1,510 full laborers left. Most of them are plowing the land and carrying manure. All the autumn land is mainly worked by women and children, who harvested and threshed it all in ten days. Cultivation has begun on more than 110,000 mu of wheat land. The 3rd District originally planned to plant 100,000 mu of wheat, but now it has eliminated another 4,432 mu of mature wasteland and is also preparing to plant wheat. The entire county (except the 4th District) plans to plant 420,000 mu of "Counter-Offensive Wheat". In addition, there are more than 12,100 mu of mature wasteland, which are also planned to be mostly planted with wheat. Everyone said, "This year is the beginning of the counter-offensive, and everyone is planting more counter-offensive wheat to prepare white flour for the victorious counter-offensive army." The characteristic of this year's autumn harvest is that cadres take the lead, and men, women, old and young all go to the fields together. Cadres of Donggou Village led all the women, children, and elderly in the village to make a concentrated effort to harvest, exceeding the planned work by more than 100 units. Comrade Sun Qunsuo, the party branch secretary of Yu Neng, and Village Chief Zhou Shihong personally led mutual aid teams, carrying grain and manure during the day, listening to reports from each group at night, and arranging work for the next day. They worked diligently day and night and completed the eight-day plan in six days. A women's mutual aid team in Fangmaping, consisting of 24 people, harvested 41 mu of grain in seven days, and also carried 283 loads of manure and 236 loads of grain back. Forty children in Lan Che were organized to level 24 mu of stubble in five days, and eighty elderly people were organized to be responsible for threshing. Because organization saves one-third of the labor, and women, children, and the elderly all go to the fields, not only is the labor force participating in the war and supporting the front supplemented, but there is also a surplus. Most of the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and disabled veterans voluntarily declined preferential treatment and participated in labor. This year's autumn harvest not only does not feel a lack of labor, but is also abundant.

[This dispatch was sent from the Taiyue office of this newspaper on October 3rd] Tunliu villages are stepping up wheat planting and fertilizer production. The Xicun base point has planted all 6,695 mu of wheat land. Under the leadership of labor hero Yin Hongxian, Liu× Village not only planted all the old wheat land in the village, but also completely planted wheat on all 2,409 mu of mature wasteland and sesame land in the village, and called on each household to change two to three mu of stubble land to wheat. All 1,410 mu of wheat land belonging to military families in the base point have also been planted. The Xiaocun Wuchengling base point in Yuwu has organized the planting of wheat on all the village land, and is preparing to replant 35 mu of stubble wheat. In the 3rd District, villages are seizing the opportunity in the gap between the grains not being yellow and the wheat not being planted, and are using various methods to produce fertilizer in order to apply more fertilizer per mu of land. Sanjiao teacher Shen Ruiyin led 167 people in the village to cut more than 40,000 jin of artemisia in half a day. The Wuyuan base point uses wheat bran to compost manure, which can be applied to 400 mu of land. The Shanglian base point digs grass slopes and uses them as bedding, composting 36,000 loads of manure. According to incomplete statistics, the five base point villages in the district have cut 965,100 jin of artemisia, which, together with digging grass slopes and bedding, can compost a total of 1.34 million loads of manure. With 40 loads of manure applied per mu, more than 33,700 mu of land can be fertilized.

　　晋城秋收全部完成
  　灭荒多种“反攻麦”
  　屯留抓紧收种空隙大量造肥
    【本报太岳三日电】晋城依靠男女齐力干，从上月十日至廿五日，半月工夫已全部完成秋收，正准备种麦。七区原计划二十五天收完，结果五天就把全部谷割完，现正突击平茬送粪消灭熟荒，麦子准备比去年多种两万亩。五区全区除参战支前外，现剩下一千五百一十个全劳力，大部犁地担粪，所有秋地主要靠妇女儿童，十天就割光打光。十一万余亩麦地已开始耕种。三区全区原准备种十万亩麦子，现又消灭四千四百三十二亩熟荒，亦准备种麦，全县（缺四区）计划种四十二万亩“反攻麦”，另外熟荒一万二千一百余亩，亦计划大部种麦，大家都说：“今年是反攻开始年，大家多种反攻麦，为反攻胜利军准备下白面”。今年秋收的特点，干部带头，男女老少一齐上地。东沟村干部带领全村妇女、儿童、老人、突击秋收，超过计划的工百余个。庾能支书孙群锁、村长周世宏等同志，亲自带领互助组，白天担谷送粪，夜里听取各小组汇报，布置明天工作，日夜勤劳，八天计划六天完成。放马坪一个妇女互助组，二十四人七天割谷四十一亩，还担去二百八十三担粪，担回二百三十六个谷。栏车四十个儿童组织起来，五天平了二十四亩茬，八十个老人组织起来，担任打场。由于组织起来省工三分之一，妇女、儿童、老人都下地，不但补足参战支前的劳力，而且还有剩余，大部军烈属、荣军又自动谢绝优待，参加劳动，今年秋收不仅不感劳力缺乏，而且充裕。
    【本报太岳三日电】屯留各村加紧种麦与造肥。西村基点已把麦地六千六百九十五亩全部种上。柳×村在劳动英雄印宏先领导下，除将全村旧麦地种完外，又把全村二千四百零九亩熟荒地和胡麻地完全种了麦子，并号召每户再改茬麦地二亩至三亩。基点所有军属的一千四百一十亩麦地，亦已全部种完。余吾基点小村五成岭，组织起来已把全村麦种上，并准备回茬麦三十五亩。三区各村在谷子未黄麦子还不种的空隙中，抓紧机会，用各种方法造肥，以便每亩地多上些肥料。三交教员申瑞银，领导全村一百六十七人，半天割蒿四万余斤。吾元基点用麦糠沤粪，能上地四百亩。上莲基点刨草坡，沤粪三万六千担。据不完全统计，全区五个基点村，已割蒿九十六万五千一百斤，连同刨草坡垫圈等共可沤粪一百三十四万余担。每亩上粪四十担，能上地三万三千七百余亩。
