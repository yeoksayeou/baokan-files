　　Taihang North and South Lines
  　Tensely Defend Autumn Harvest
    [Report from our Taihang Office, 12th] The autumn harvest defense battle in the Taihang border region entered its most intense phase in the second half of September. The characteristic of this stage is that we take the initiative to attack, enter the enemy's rear, capture traitors and bullies, and divide the autumn harvest and fields, giving the Chiang and Yan bandits a serious blow in their grain grabbing. On the southern front, the periphery of Xinxiang: The 122nd Brigade of the 41st Division of the Chiang bandits stationed in Huixian, gathered more than 3,000 people from the Xinxiang and Huixian puppet security regiments and the Hebei Security 12th Column, and under the personal command of Li Zhiming, the chief of staff of the division, launched an attack in three routes on the areas south and west of Huixian on September 20th, attempting to cooperate with the bandits who were isolated in Huojia, Xiuwu, and Wuzhi on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway line, forming a grain grabbing area in the vast plains north of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway on the west side of the Pinghan Railway. Our local armed forces intercepted them in separate routes, annihilating more than 400 enemies, seizing two mortars, twelve light and heavy machine guns, and more than 200 rifles, severely hitting the enemy's grain grabbing plan. Periphery of Anyang: The military and civilians in Tangyin annihilated more than 40 enemies who ventured out from Anyang to grab grain in one week in the second half of September. The grain struggle in Anyang is even more intense. On September 13th, after the enemy occupied Qugou, they adopted a key grain grabbing policy and organized fleeing traitors, bullies and landlords to loot. Our military and civilians acted quickly, organized a strong grain grabbing team, and carried out a comprehensive grain grab. The slogan "three nothings" was put forward (no crops on the land, no ears of grain on the threshing ground, no grain in the homes). At the same time, landlords were strictly controlled to prevent them from sabotaging. The action was swift, and the grain was grabbed overnight. A team (five people) in Anche Village grabbed more than three mu of millet in one night. The armed work team of the Eighth District advanced into the enemy's rear and killed 14 traitors and bullies who grabbed grain, causing other landlords to stop grabbing grain. The Fourth District grabbed more than 360 mu in three days, and the Fifth District grabbed more than 300 mu in one day. The entire county was covered with autumn crops, most of which have been recovered. During the grain grabbing, the enemy harassed every day, and our military and civilians fought bravely for twelve days and nights, annihilating more than 200 enemies. On both sides of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, the enemies stationed in Xiuwu, Jiaozuo, and Huojia began to grab grain in the Xiuwu area north of the railway on September 18th. Our military and civilians in Xiuwu were all mobilized for armed grain grabbing. The hinterland of the Second District supported the border area, and grabbed more than 400 mu of rice for Wuliyuan, Nanzhuang and other villages in two days. Our local armed forces and militia killed or wounded more than ten enemies in the Mazhuang area on September 18th, and killed or wounded 20 enemies near Banqiao on the 20th, seizing one machine gun and three rifles. The enemy fled in panic and did not dare to attack for several days.
    Northern Front – Under the slogan of "Strike First," Yuanshi County on the outskirts of Shijiazhuang organized north-south grain protection brigades in mid-September, concentrating dozens of villages in the hinterland to support the border area. Five villages including Zhaocun organized a support team of 100 young adults and 89 carts to grab grain in the Silianshuang area near the railway, recovering more than 400 dan of grain in two days. When Nan Yin Village in the Seventh District heard that the Chiang bandits were organizing fleeing landlords to return to the village to grab grain, they took the lead and divided the land of 30 landlords while harvesting it. Nan Village in the Fifth District divided more than 300 mu of land belonging to traitors and bullies, and grabbed more than 60 mu under artillery fire. During the grain grabbing, the actions of the masses were very combat-oriented, with threshing in the afternoon and no grain to be seen at night. The tactics of combining cold shots and tunnels were generally adopted against the invading enemies, making them afraid to grab grain at will. Once, the enemy Wei Yonghe's troops and more than 1,000 traitors and bullies stationed in Yuanshi invaded the Shiyan area. Our militia used tunnels, bunkers, and concealed bunkers to launch cold shot battles, fiercely attacking the enemy. One militiaman shot down three enemies with three shots, causing the enemy to flee in panic. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the enemies in Shijiazhuang and Huolu repeatedly grabbed grain in the Shanyi, North and South Shangshanzhai, and Chaozhuang areas on the outskirts of Huolu, but were blocked by our landmines and cold shots, and failed to succeed. In the Yuci, Taigu, and Qixian areas on the east side of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, our counter-grain grabbing struggle has also repeatedly won victories. On September 22nd, more than 300 bandits from the Fendou Fourth Regiment of the Yan bandits stationed in Tuanbai, Qixian, grabbed grain in the Banshan area (near Zihong in the southeast of Qixian), but were bravely intercepted by our sub-district troops and militia, and the entire enemy was annihilated. More than 100 enemies were killed, and 216 enemies including Battalion Commander Ni Guohua were captured, along with 14 machine guns, 2 small cannons, 78 long and short guns, more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition, 15 head of livestock, and some grain were seized. The Taigu Regiment cooperated with the militia on September 20th to take the initiative to attack the enemy's rear in Beiyang (stronghold), Chaoyang, Xincun (both two li away from the railway), and other villages, capturing more than 80 traitors, bullies and landlords alive, and helping the masses to divide the fields, autumn harvest, and grain on the spot. In Xincun alone, more than 70 dan of wheat were divided. This disrupted the Yan bandits' grain grabbing organization and effectively defended the autumn harvest in the border area.
