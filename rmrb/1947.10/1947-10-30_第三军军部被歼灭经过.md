　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 28th: A frontline reporter reports on the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's Third Army Headquarters: After two days and nights of fierce fighting, by dawn on the 22nd, all of the Third Army's personnel were compressed into the village of Southwest He, under the jurisdiction of Ding County. The army headquarters was located in a large courtyard in the southwest corner. The army commander, Luo Lirong, even ordered a desperate defense, foolishly awaiting reinforcements from Baoding. However, the People's Liberation Army soldiers had already broken into the village from the northwest corner, and dense artillery shells fell around the courtyard where the army headquarters was located. At this point, the army headquarters had become the front line. The Chiang Kai-shek troops only cared about fleeing in all directions. Deputy Army Commander Yang Guangyu scrambled out of a shelter, shouting orders, but People's Liberation Army soldiers had already appeared on the rooftops. The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers guarding the rooftops were thrown into chaos. In the confusion, someone shouted, "Break through the walls! Break through the walls! Charge towards the 7th Division's courtyard!" The enemy soldiers, under the rain of our bullets, fled for their lives, rolling and crawling. In fact, the 7th Division headquarters was in just as much danger. People inside the division headquarters saw many yellow figures climbing onto the rooftops and shouted in joy, "The reinforcements are here!" Chiang Kai-shek soldiers scrambled to welcome them out of the houses, but when they saw that the people wearing grass-yellow new cotton uniforms were People's Liberation Army soldiers, they were so frightened that they scurried out. Unexpectedly, they bumped head-on into the retreating personnel from the Third Army headquarters. The two groups converged, charging south and colliding north, in utter chaos. Their escape route had already been sealed off by our artillery fire. As the Chiang Kai-shek troops were running around in the alleys, an artillery shell landed, and many bandits were blown over. Luo Lirong and others hurriedly climbed over a wall and squeezed into a house. Before they could recover from their shock, People's Liberation Army soldiers were already at the door, shouting loudly, "Surrender your weapons immediately!" Army Commander Luo Lirong, Division Commander Li Yongzhang, and more than a hundred others were captured in this chaos. However, Deputy Army Commander Yang Guangyu, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Headquarters Wu Tiezheng, and Deputy Director of the News Office Song Hanwen, etc., were not seen in the group of prisoners. It was later discovered that they were already lined up in another group of prisoners.

　　第三军军部被歼灭经过
    【新华社晋察冀前线二十八日电】前线记者报导蒋匪第三军军部被歼经过称：经两昼夜的激战，至二十二日拂晓第三军的全部人马被压缩至定县属的西南合村里，军部设于西南角一个大院内，军长罗历戎还下令死守，痴待保定的救援，但是解放军战士早已从西北角突进村内，密集的炮弹纷纷落到军部住院的四周；这时，军部已变成第一线了，蒋匪军只顾四处逃命，副军长杨光钰狼狈的从掩蔽部内钻出来吆喝着指挥，可是解放军的战士已经出现在房顶上，房顶的蒋匪守兵一阵大乱，在混乱中只听有人喊道：“打墙、打墙、往第七师住院冲！”匪军们便在我军的弹雨下，连滚带爬的逃命而去。其实第七师师部亦一样危急。师部里的人看见许多黄色的人影爬上房顶喜的乱喊道：“援军来了”！蒋匪争着迎出屋子，但当他们看清穿着草黄色新棉衣的是解放军时，吓得往外乱窜，不料迎头又碰上逃来的第三军军部人马，两处会合一起，南冲北撞，乱作一团，逃路已被我炮火封住。当蒋军正在巷子里乱转时，一颗炮弹落下，好些匪徒被炸倒了。罗历戎等慌忙翻过一道墙，钻进一间屋子里，惊魂未定，门口早有解放军的战士大声喊道：“赶快缴枪”。军长罗历戎、师长李用章等以下一百多人就在这慌乱中被擒了。但在俘虏群中未见到副军长杨光钰、军部副参谋长吴铁铮和新闻处副主任宋汉文等，后来才发现他们已经排列在另一俘虏群里。
