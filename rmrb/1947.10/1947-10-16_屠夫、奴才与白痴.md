　　Butchers, Lackeys, and Idiots
    Xinhua News Agency
    The American war-monger Bullitt proposed to buy China's 450 million people for 1.35 billion US dollars to fight for the United States under MacArthur's command, and Chiang Kai-shek immediately welcomed it warmly. This fact nakedly exposes the butcher face of American imperialists and the lackey face of Chinese traitors. Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency's New York dispatch on the 10th quoted Bullitt's original words: "If China is prevented from being manipulated by any country (?), China can mobilize 400 million people to fight against the Soviet Union, which is of extreme benefit to the United States." Every Chinese, including everyone in Chiang Kai-shek's army and organs, should think carefully about the meaning of this sentence. What do American imperialists see Chinese people as? As cannon fodder selling for three US dollars apiece. "Extremely profitable" and "cheap." What does Chiang Kai-shek see Chinese people as? As commodities earning three US dollars apiece. Also "extremely profitable" and "cheap" - or rather, no cost at all, because when he sells China to MacArthur or any other American marshal, American president, or American financial magnate, the only ones sacrificed on the altar are the Chinese people, while Chiang Kai-shek and his four major families do not need to shed a drop of blood. But when the butcher Bullitt and the lackey Chiang Kai-shek are pleased with themselves in this imagined transaction, they forget that they are all just idiots. They are idiots because they dare to fantasize about trading the great Chinese people, dare to fantasize that the great people can be hired and sold by them. A group of bedbugs, dazed from sucking blood, are actually calculating the "price" of 450 million great people in broad daylight; the idiot Bullitt doesn't even know the genealogy of idiots, and his colleagues recently proudly brought out four billion US dollars, fantasizing about obtaining "extreme benefits" from this "low cost." But what was the result? The result was pushing Chiang Kai-shek into today's mud pit and pushing American imperialists to the edge of the mud pit, which then aroused the clamoring of the Bullitts. If the Bullitts can spread their idiocy to such an extent that the American government moves another five hundred million, one billion, one billion three hundred and fifty million, or some other amount of US dollars to Nanjing, then the only result will be to completely move Chiang Kai-shek into the grave and move American imperialists to the edge of the grave. The great Chinese people only know how to seize the weapons of the invaders and fight against the invaders, seize the weapons of the traitors and fight against the traitors, and will never be crazy enough to imagine fighting against their friends, as those idiots depict in their dreams. Let those idiotic conspirators dream, the great Chinese people will lose nothing but chains in their inevitable struggle, and what they will gain is all of China.

　　屠夫、奴才与白痴
    新华社
    美国战争贩子布立特，提议以十三亿五千万美元购买中国四万万五千万人口，在麦克阿瑟指挥下，为美国作战，而蒋介石则立即予以热烈欢迎。这一件事实，把美国帝国主义者的屠夫面目，把中国卖国贼的奴才面目，赤裸裸的暴露出来了。蒋介石中央社十日纽约的电讯，引用布立特原文说：“阻止中国受任何国家操纵（？），中国即可动员四亿人民对苏作战，此对美国为一极大利益。”每个中国人，包括蒋介石军队中和机关中的每个中国人，都应该好好想一想这句话的意义。美国帝国主义者把中国人看做什么？看做卖三块美元一只的炮灰。“利益极大”而“代价低廉。”蒋介石把中国人看做什么？看做赚三块美金一只的商品。也是“利益极大”而“代价低廉”——或者说代价毫无，因为他把中国出卖给麦克阿瑟或其他任何美国元帅、美国总统或美国金融大王，在祭坛上做牺牲品的，只是中国人民，蒋介石及其四大家族是无须流一滴血的。但是当屠夫布立特之流和奴才蒋介石之流在这个想象的交易中得意的时候，他们忘记了他们自己都只是一样白痴。他们是白痴，因为他们胆敢妄想拿伟大的中国人民做买卖，胆敢妄想伟大的人民能被他们雇佣和出卖。一群吸血吸得发昏的臭虫，居然在光天化日之下计算着四万万五千万伟大人民的“价格”；白痴布立特甚至连白痴的家谱也不知道，他的同僚不久以前曾经得意的搬出了四十亿美元，妄想由这个“低廉代价”获得“极大利益”。但是结果呢？结果是把蒋介石搬进了今天的泥坑，并且把美国帝国主义者搬到泥坑的边缘，这样才又引起了布立特们的叫嚣。如果布立特之流能够散布他们的白痴病到这种地步，以致美国政府再向南京搬出无论是五亿、十亿、十三亿五千万或另一个什么数目的美元来，那么唯一的结果也只是把蒋介石完全搬进坟墓，并且把美国帝国主义者搬到坟墓的边缘。伟大的中国人民只知道夺取侵略者的武器，向侵略者作战，夺取卖国贼的武器，向卖国贼作战，而永远也不会疯狂到去设想和自己的友人作战，如同那些白痴们在梦中所描绘的那样。让那些白痴的阴谋家们去作梦吧，伟大的中国人民在自己的必胜的奋斗中，除了枷锁之外什么也不会失去，而要得到的却是全中国。
