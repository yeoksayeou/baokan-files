(Reported by our newspaper from Southern Hebei on the 13th) Land-reformed peasants in Zhangnan are eagerly joining the county brigade to defend their gains and protect their homes. At a meeting to encourage enlistment, Song Jingfu, the militia captain of Da Li Village, signed up and said, "In the past, my family was starving. They offered me thirty 'shi' of wheat to become a puppet soldier for Chiang Kai-shek, but I thought about it and refused to do that shameful thing. Now I am joining the army to protect the land I was given. I won't take a single thing from the village. Not only am I going, but I guarantee to bring six militiamen with me." Influenced by him, seventeen village cadres immediately volunteered. The masses also have extremely high enthusiasm for joining the army and the war. In Shipan Village, each street and organization, down to the smallest groups, started competing to enlist. After a day of discussion, fourteen young men volunteered. Guo Lao, the self-defense captain of Dongshang Village in the Sixth District, persuaded his son, Guo Shouren, to join the army, saying, "In the past, we didn't own an inch of land. When the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came, we reclaimed nineteen 'mu' of land and were given ten 'mu' of good land. We can't forget to protect our gains. Shouren, you must join the army." His wife also urged, "Did you hear what your father said? You should join the army and protect our few 'mu' of land!" Encouraged by his parents, Shouren happily enlisted.

  　纷纷参加县大队
    【本报冀南十三日电】漳南翻身农民纷纷参加县大队，保卫果实保卫家乡。在参军参战会上，大李村民兵队长宋景福报名说：“从前我家饿着，给我三十石麦子，买我当蒋伪军，我想了想不干那丢人的事。现在我参军，保护我分的地，不叫村里给我一点东西，不但我去，还保证带六个民兵一同去。”在他影响下，十七名村干当场报告。群众参军参战情绪也极高，如石盘屯各街、各组织直到小组，都挑起战来，经一天的酝酿，即有十四名青壮年自动报名。六区东上村自卫队长郭老，劝他儿子郭寿任参军时说：“过去咱没一亩地，共产党八路军过来了，咱把十九亩地收回过来，又分给咱十亩好地，咱可不能忘了保卫咱的果实，寿任，你要参军去。”他老婆也劝说：“你爹说的话你听见了没？你参军去吧，保护咱那几亩地呀！”在老俩口劝勉之下，寿任很痛快的参军了。
