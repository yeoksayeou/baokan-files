　　The entire Military and Political University Deeply Engages in Complaining of Suffering and Confessing Sins
  　Consciously Liquidates Landlord Ideology
    [Our News] In order to eliminate landlord ideology among all personnel, the Party Committee of the Military and Political University issued a decision on September 24 regarding in-depth land reform education and thorough investigation of class and ideology. It stipulated that for a period of three weeks, most of the cadres, except for a small number who would continue to work, would be concentrated and all work would be stopped to focus on studying. After the first step of correcting attitudes and holding group discussions, the movement then transitioned to a universal movement of complaining of suffering and confessing sins. The first to begin were comrades of poor and hired peasant backgrounds complaining of suffering. In the First Brigade, 156 relatives of those with poor and hired peasant backgrounds had been killed by landlords (incomplete statistics). Wang Zhenyuan complained that his family sold his younger brother and sister under the duress of the landlord. From a young age, he herded sheep for the landlord. Once, a sheep was killed by a wolf, and the landlord ordered him to carry the dead sheep on his shoulders, kneel for a long time, and hang him headfirst in a well.... When it came to the point of pain, both he and the entire audience burst into tears. Hu Guangzhong fainted on the ground from crying, but still wanted to complain. Among the 272 poor and hired peasant comrades in the Third Brigade, 484 relatives had been forced to death by landlords. In the Third Team's complaints, more than a dozen people fainted or fell ill from crying. Shang Junsheng cried so much that he couldn't speak, only howled: "My family had six lives! ... My family had six lives! ..." In the Fourth, Sixth, and Fifth Teams, 37 comrades had 77 family members forced to death by landlords. In the Second Team, Lu Linshi fainted from anger during his complaint and was only revived after an hour of emergency treatment. In the Fourth Team's complaint before the spirit tablet, everyone cried until late at night and refused to leave, even when pulled. ... After hearing others complain of suffering, comrades of landlord and rich peasant backgrounds became resentful of their own families and actively requested to confess their sins. Some officers who had been liberated or revolted, in addition to complaining about the suffering or confessing the sins of their landlord families, also voluntarily confessed their crimes in the army. Through complaining of suffering and confessing sins, everyone's class consciousness was raised a step further. Those of poor and hired peasant backgrounds expressed: We will resolutely eliminate the landlord class and its old roots, Chiang Kai-shek, and avenge our dead parents, brothers, and sisters; those from landlord class backgrounds also expressed one after another: We will resolutely betray the landlord class, gloriously surrender to the proletariat, and perform meritorious service to atone for our sins. Based on their initial resolutions, they then turned back to examine their own thoughts and actions. Some of poor and hired peasant backgrounds repented that they had forgotten their roots, forgotten their hatred, and forgotten the kindness; some of landlord and rich peasant backgrounds regretted that they had not faced up to the crimes of the landlord class in the past, had serious landlord ideology, and had made many mistakes that harmed the interests of the people, failing the people and the Communist Party. For example, Li Qingxiang, of poor peasant background, regretted saying: "I forgot how my parents died (forced to death by the landlord). When working in the local area, I had a relationship with the landlord's daughter, shielded the landlord, and was unwilling to struggle against him...." After the complaint meeting, Zhang Ping, of poor peasant background, cried for four days and wrote a letter in blood. At the public memorial meeting of the entire brigade, he cried again and couldn't speak. He regretted that when he was working in the local area, he had been a landlord's air raid shelter, had not worked hard for the people, lived a corrupt life, ate well, dressed well, and cheaply bought fruit, ignoring the fact that the masses had not yet turned themselves over. Wang Zongbao regretted that when he was a village and district cadre, he found the work troublesome and divided up more struggle fruits. When the leadership asked him to return them, he couldn't accept it ideologically. Dong Hongzhang cried and told of the tragic death of his father, who had been forced to death by the landlord, and then confessed that in his work, he had followed the landlord and had also embezzled five sheng of millet, twenty yuan, a straw hat, and a pair of shorts. Meng Jun, of landlord background, recalled that although he had been a revolutionary for more than ten years, he had made many mistakes due to the existence of landlord ideology. In Jiaozuo, he had a big fight with the municipal government for shielding a major traitorous landlord. When he heard that his hometown (Wuzhi) had been liberated, he cried for half the night out of fear of struggling against his family. When he heard that his hometown had been lost again, he was secretly happy.... Thinking of this, he cried uncontrollably. Comrade Zhu Jiuwu examined himself and realized that because he was standing on the landlord's position, he had actually let go of a tyrannical landlord (his brother-in-law) who had political suspicions and was hiding three guns and opium.... At the time, he cried bitterly and cursed himself: "I let go of the enemy... this is a counter-revolutionary act!" After everyone had initially examined their own thoughts and behaviors, they wrote letters to the local governments and villages, requesting a thorough re-investigation of their families, or telling the government and the masses about the things they knew were buried in their homes, or expressing their attitude to support the masses in struggling against their own families, and handing over the blood and sweat of the people taken from their homes, as well as embezzled, cheaply bought, and over-distributed struggle fruits, etc.
    The experience of this movement proves that comrades of landlord and rich peasant backgrounds, after exposing and recognizing the crimes of their own families, can consciously examine their own landlord positions and ideologically sever their relationship with the landlords. Comrades of peasant backgrounds, after complaining of suffering, can examine their thoughts and behaviors of forgetting their roots. Through complaining of suffering and confessing sins, they can clarify the concept that the landlord class is the enemy of the people. It also proves that the complaining of suffering by comrades of peasant backgrounds and the confessing of sins by comrades of landlord and rich peasant backgrounds can and need to be carried out in coordination, so that they can achieve mutual inspiration and education, and jointly improve their consciousness. Finally: Complaining of suffering, confessing sins, and examining class standpoints can and need to be carried out in combination, so that a mass movement of conscious examination of landlord ideology can be formed.

　　军大全体深入诉苦述罪
  　自觉清算地主思想
    【本报讯】军政大学校党委会为使全校人员，扫清地主思想，特于九月二十四日，发布关于深入土改教育和彻底查阶级查思想的决定。规定以三周时间，干部除留少数坚持工作外，大部集中起来，停止一切工作，专门学习。经过端正态度、小组座谈等第一个步骤后，接着即转入普遍的诉苦述罪运动。首先展开的是贫雇农成份的同志诉苦。一大队贫雇成份，被地主害死亲人一百五十六个（不完全统计），王贞元诉他家在地主威逼下卖了弟弟和妹妹，他从小给地主放羊，有一次，羊被狼咬死一只，地主命他把死羊挎在肩上，跪了好久，并把他头朝下，吊在井里……。诉到痛处，本人和全场都嚎啕大哭。胡光忠哭的昏倒地上，还要诉。三大队二百七十二个贫雇成份，即有四百八十四个亲属被地主逼死。三队诉苦哭昏哭病了十几个。尚俊生哭的说不出话，只嚎叫：“我家六条人命啊！……我家六条人命啊！……”四、六、五队三十七个同志，家中即被地主逼死七十七口人，二队路林士，诉到痛处，气死一点钟才急救过来。四队灵前诉苦，大家哭到深夜不起来，拉也拉不走。……地主富农成份的同志，听了别人诉苦后，引起对自己家庭的愤恨，纷纷自动要求述罪。有些解放或起义过来的军官，除诉苦或述地主家庭的罪外，还自动述了自己在军队里的罪恶。经过诉苦述罪，大家的阶级觉悟都提高了一步。贫雇成份的表示：坚决消灭地主阶级和它的老根子蒋介石，为死去的父母兄弟姐妹报仇；地主阶级出身的也纷纷表示：要坚决背叛地主阶级，光荣投降无产阶级，为人民立功赎罪。根据自己初步的决心，再回头检查自己的思想和行动，一些贫雇成份的忏悔自己忘了本，忘了仇，忘了恩，一些地主富农成份的，后悔自己过去不正视地主阶级的罪恶，存在着严重的地主思想，犯了许多危害人民利益的错误，对不起人民、对不起共产党。如贫雇成份的李庆祥后悔说：“我忘了父母怎样死的（地主逼死），在地方上工作时，与地主女儿发生关系，包庇地主，不愿斗争他……”。贫雇成份张平诉苦会后，哭了四天，写了血书，全大队公祭大会上，又哭的说不出话，他悔恨他在地方上工作时，当过地主防空洞，没好好为人民出力，生活腐化，吃好穿好，贱买果实，群众没翻好身也不管，忘了本。王宗保悔恨他当村区干部时，工作嫌麻烦，多分斗争果实，领导上叫退，思想打不通。董鸿章哭诉他父亲被地主逼死的惨状后，忏悔自己在工作岗位上，跟着地主跑，还贪污五升小米，二十元钱，一顶草帽，一条短裤。地主成份的，如孟均同志，想起他虽革命十来年了，因地主思想存在，犯很多错误。在焦作因包庇一个大汉奸地主，曾与市政府大闹，听到家乡（武陟）解放，因害怕斗争家庭，愁的哭了半夜，听到家乡又失了，心里倒有些高兴，……想到这里哭不成声。朱九武同志检查自己因站在地主立场，竟放走一个有政治嫌疑的、保藏着三支枪和大烟土的恶霸地主（他姐夫）……时，痛哭流涕骂自己：“我放走了敌人……，这是反革命行为！”大家初步检查了自己的思想行为后，纷纷给地方政府及村中写信，要求彻底复查自己家庭，或将自己知道家中埋藏的东西告诉政府及群众，或表示态度，支持群众斗争自己家庭，以及交出从家中拿来的人民血汗，交出贪污、贱买、多分的斗争果实等。
    这段运动的经验证明：地主富农成份的同志，经过对自己家庭罪恶的揭露和认识，就能自觉的检讨自己的地主立场，就能从思想上断绝和地主的关系。农民成份的同志，经过诉苦，就能检讨忘本的思想和行为。经过诉苦和述罪就能明确地主阶级是人民的敌人这一观念。又证明：农民成份的诉苦和地主富农成份的述罪，是可以而且需要配合起来进行的，这样可以达到互相启发和教育，共同提高觉悟。最后：诉苦述罪和检查阶级立场是可以而且需要结合起来进行，这样就可以形成群众性的自觉的检查地主思想的运动。（梅村、学习报）
