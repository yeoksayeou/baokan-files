Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: New York dispatch: The American people's voices against the authorities' reactionary domestic and foreign policies are growing louder. Under the auspices of the American Women's Congress, a gathering of one thousand people was held in New York on the 2nd, loudly protesting the foreign policy of American imperialism. Speakers at the meeting were enthusiastic. Professor Shapley, a famous astronomer, strongly urged the government in his speech to "implement a policy of international cooperation and scientific freedom." Amidst indignant voices, the conference passed a proposal to Congress, Marshall, Dulles, etc., denouncing Truman and Marshall's policies that bypassed the United Nations, and demanding that the United States destroy its existing atomic bombs to prove its genuine desire to safeguard world peace. The proposal emphasized: "American foreign policy should be based on cooperation with other countries, not using atomic bombs as a tool of threat, or ordering other countries through military and economic assistance to reactionary governments led by fascists." Another dispatch: The Boston Electrical Workers Union recently held a meeting and resolved to criticize the authorities' domestic and foreign policies, demanding that the authorities' foreign policy "should be directed towards peace." The resolution pointed out: "The current government is under the control of industrial magnates," and "almost every week there are new appointments, appointing Wall Street bankers to positions controlling national domestic and foreign policies." After hearing reports from the union's representatives in Washington, Nixon and Ayer, about the persecution of union members by FBI agents, the meeting resolved to condemn the government's actions in violating civil rights.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: New York dispatch: The American people's movement against high prices is growing. The American Progressive Citizens Association held a demonstration in front of the headquarters of the "National Association of Manufacturers" on the 23rd, opposing the monopoly capitalists' raising of prices and condemning the association for being responsible for the abolition of price controls. Representatives of the New York State CIO Consumer Organization, at a subcommittee of Congress investigating high prices, demanded that a special session of Congress be convened to restore price controls, restore excess profits tax, and raise the minimum wage. The representative proved that any working family in New York City can no longer afford basic necessities under current prices and wages. Representatives of the American Women's Congress and other groups held empty bags while testifying before the Congressional subcommittee, with the words "Taft: We have little income and much expenditure." A representative of the New York "American Veterans Committee" stated: If another economic crisis occurs, veterans of the Second World War will strike hard at speculators and profiteers. Taft's recent demand that the American people "eat less" and Interior Secretary Krug's advice to people to "eat more fish and less expensive meat and eggs" have been unanimously condemned by the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: New York dispatch: American prices are still rising and have seriously threatened the living standards of Americans. According to a report released by the US Department of Labor Statistics Bureau on the 25th, the wholesale price index for all items reached 158.1 percent of the 1926 average level last week, an increase of 0.4 percent from the previous week and 27.7 percent from the same week last year. Flanders, chairman of the Congressional subcommittee currently investigating high prices in New York City, recently declared to the press: Due to high prices, one-third of the people in New York City can no longer afford meat. Archbishop Gilbert of the Anglican Church told the committee: One-third of the babies in New York are malnourished, and some are on the verge of starvation.
