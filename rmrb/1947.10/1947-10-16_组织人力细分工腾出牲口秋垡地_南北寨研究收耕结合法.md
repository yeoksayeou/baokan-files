　　[This report from Changzhi] On October 5th, key cadres from 21 villages in the North and South Zhai sub-districts gathered to discuss the autumn harvest and autumn plowing situation. The head of Baosha Village said, "This year, the work is very tight. With small groups and few people, we can't plow the fields if we harvest the crops, and we can't harvest the crops if we plow the fields." The political director of Beizhai Village said, "Our village has 37 hectares of land, and the autumn harvest and autumn plowing are difficult. Fifty-six livestock are not enough. Seeing that the soil is wet and will freeze early this year, we plowed 400 mu of land last year, but most of the land was not plowed. We'll suffer this year. There's a lot of grass growing in the fields." Zhao Lianzhi from Qiu Village said, "The land that was plowed last year is growing better this year, and there is less grass." Based on these situations, those who didn't plow last year are suffering a lot this year. Therefore, we must organize well. (1) Combine the autumn harvest and autumn plowing. Lu Laiyou from Zifang Village said, "To combine the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, we must expand the groups and organize autumn harvest brigades. With more people, we can divide the work, with some harvesting and others plowing, so that the land can be cleared and the work can be done quickly." (2) Ma Qiyun from Zifang Village said, "The autumn harvest contracting method is the best. Estimate how much work is needed for a piece of land, issue work tickets, and after everyone finishes, evaluate the work and issue work tickets accordingly. Finish one piece of land and clear it, which is fair and saves labor." Zhao Lianzhi, a model worker from Qiu Village, said, "Our village has 1,200 mu of land and 45 livestock. We can complete the autumn harvest and autumn plowing in half a month. Everyone can come and check." The political director of Beizhai Village said, "Our village can complete the autumn harvest and autumn plowing in 20 days, and we will compete with Qiu Village." The head of Zhangze Village said, "Our village has about the same amount of land as Bitou Village, and we dare to compete with them. The day their village finishes is the day our village finishes." Everyone is enthusiastic, striving to be a model in the autumn harvest and autumn plowing.

    [This report from Changzhi] Wang Sandong's mutual aid group in Yuzhuang, Changzhi First District, consisting of seven households, has completed harvesting 45 mu of grain and 6 mu of beans, and has plowed 6 mu of bean leaf land, covering the bean leaves to act as fertilizer. The slogan is "Cut one piece as it turns yellow, plow one piece as it is cleared." When livestock are plowing the autumn fields, they should bring back crops, and women and children should bring back as much as they can. Allocate work points based on distance, whether pulled by livestock or pushed by manpower, all based on the work done, rewarding labor. Autumn plowing has now begun. Livestock are hauling corn, and people are in charge of peeling it. On the 24th of last month, the autumn harvest was completed, and livestock were concentrated on plowing the fields. The entire group has 130 mu of autumn land. With two livestock, they can plow 5 mu per day, and it will take almost a month to plow it all. They plan to organize four people to dig up the corn stalks and four people to pull the plow, plowing 4 mu per day, and they can plow the 42 mu of corn land in ten days. This will allow them to complete it ten days earlier. Under the promotion of Wang Sandong's group's plan, the entire area is organized, and the entire village uses work point tickets to start peeling corn and plowing the autumn stubble fields. The entire village has 4,784.8 mu of stubble, with 79 livestock, averaging 60 mu per head. Organize another group of people to pull plows, ensuring that not a single mu of stubble is left unplowed, and complete the autumn plowing by the 15th day of the ninth lunar month. The masses reported that this year's autumn organization is "three more and three clear": more fertilizer applied, more wheat planted, and more grain harvested in autumn than in previous years. The crops in the fields are harvested cleanly, the threshing floor is cleared, and the stubble is plowed cleanly. (Chang Yu)
