　　Qinyuan First District
  　Organizes Full and Semi-Able-Bodied Labor to Promote Autumn Harvest and Planting
    [Our newspaper Taiyue 9th dispatch] Qinyuan First District organized semi-able-bodied labor to complete the autumn planting within one month. On the 2nd of this month, the district convened a meeting of more than 200 village cadres, labor heroes, and activists from various systems throughout the district to summarize the autumn harvest and planting. It was calculated that the district had planted more than 15,000 mu of wheat in three days, expanding the wheat fields by 1,687.2 mu compared to last year. Among them, 655 mu of wheat fields belonging to civilian laborers participating in the war were cultivated and sown by everyone through mutual assistance. At the same time, more than 5,610,000 jin of artemisia were harvested, and 115,200 jin of indigo were threshed. Thanks to the emphasis of village cadres on organizing semi-able-bodied labor, the autumn planting was successfully completed despite the extreme shortage of manpower and animal power. Under the leadership of Sun Doujin, Zhongyu Village completely organized more than 60 children, more than 50 old men and women to participate in wheat planting, and planted more than 300 mu and replanted more than 100 mu within half a month. The wheat seedlings have grown lush and green, already two inches high. In the harvesting of artemisia, the role of male and female semi-able-bodied labor was further brought into play, and 33 old men, women, and children emerged as heroes in harvesting artemisia. In terms of district leadership, in order to combine the autumn harvest with support for the front, a special call was made to villages to learn from the exemplary villages that had been organized, especially emphasizing the organization of all semi-able-bodied labor to make a concentrated effort in the autumn harvest and soil preparation, with the slogan: "Break through the skin in autumn, withstand the plow in spring," "Harvest a piece and plow a piece, plow the flat land first and then the mountain, plow it all." Finally, each village made a plan to complete the autumn harvest and soil preparation in October. Shishayuan, Lijiazhuang, Zhongyu and other villages also proposed the establishment of an experience exchange system between villages and villages, and villages and villages, and organized eleven visiting groups to exchange experiences with each other.

  　组织全半劳力推动秋收秋种
    【本报太岳九日电】沁源一区组织半劳力，一月内完成秋种。该区于本月二日，召集全区各系统村干部、劳动英雄、积极分子二百余人会议，总结秋收秋种，总计全区三天已种麦一万五千余亩，较去年扩大麦田一千六百八十七亩二分。其中参战民夫之六百五十五亩麦田，皆为大伙互耕下种，同时割蒿五百六十一万余斤，打蓝十一万五千二百斤。由于各村干部重视组织半劳力，虽在人畜力极端缺乏的条件下，已胜利的完成了秋种。中裕村在孙斗金的领导下，将六十多个儿童、五十多个老汉及妇女，完全组织起来参加种麦，半月内即下种三百余亩，并回茬一百余亩，现麦苗已长得绿油油地，已有二寸高。在割蒿中，更发挥了男女半劳力的作用，涌现出三十三位老汉妇女儿童割蒿英雄。该区领导上，为了将秋收与支前结合起来，特号召各村向组织起来的模范村学习，特别强调将所有的半劳力都组织起来，突击秋收刹地，其口号是：“秋天突破皮，顶住春天犁”，“收一块犁一犁，先犁平后犁山，一齐要犁完。”最后各村都订出了计划，十月份内完成秋收秋刹地。石沙垣、李家庄、中裕等村，并提出村与村、庄与庄建立交流经验制度，又组织了十一个参观小组，互相交流经验。
