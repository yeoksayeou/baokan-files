Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 11th: The East China Field Army Command announced the detailed results of the capture of Yexian on the 4th of this month as follows: The entire 5th Regiment (minus one battalion) of the Independent Brigade of the Chiang army's 8th Division (Note: This brigade was reorganized from local troops), the baggage battalion of the 42nd Brigade of the same division, and all of the Yexian "Homecoming Corps" were completely annihilated. More than 500 enemy soldiers, including the baggage battalion commander, were killed or wounded, and 2,267 enemy officers and soldiers, including the regimental commander Liu Qizhong and the puppet county magistrate, were captured alive. Seven artillery pieces, 71 heavy machine guns, 20,000 rounds of various bullets, more than 1,000 shells, and many other military supplies were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 11th: On the 8th, the Binhai Local Backbone Corps ambushed a total of 1,000 men from the Chiang's Reorganized 44th Division Assault Brigade and the tax police force under Wang Faqi, who were fleeing north from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway toward Qingkou, Xingzhuang, and other places, and completely annihilated the 2nd Company of the Assault Brigade, capturing alive the company commander Xiao Renda and 65 others, killing 12, and seizing three small cannons and three machine guns.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 11th: In Lunan, the Chiang-puppet "Homecoming Corps" are disintegrating one after another under our political offensive. In Luxi (Xin County, north of Zaozhuang) alone, 538 members of the "Homecoming Corps" disintegrated in mid-September. In the joint brigade of Zou (Ping), Fei (County), Teng (County), and Si (Shui) counties under Chiang's rule, more than 300 people have deserted in the past month, leaving less than 200. The brigade commander, Niu Tingxu, lamented to his subordinates: "If they keep running like this, how can I step down!" After a small oil vendor in Luxi brought a "Homecoming Certificate" issued by the democratic government to a certain enemy stronghold, 14 out of 16 members of the "Homecoming Corps" in that unit used the certificate to repent and start anew with the government. Now, the Chiang-puppet personnel are writing letters to the masses to confess their crimes, apologize, and request leniency.
