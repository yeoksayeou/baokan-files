　　Masses in Changzhi Second District Eagerly Sign Up to Join the War
　　[Report from this newspaper, Changzhi] The victorious news of the great counter-offensive has inspired a wave of conscious participation in the war among cadres and masses in the entire Second District. Upon hearing that the district was holding a mobilization meeting for war participation, more than twenty young and strong men from Yuanjiazhuang Village signed up even before the meeting began in the district. After mobilization in the village, more than fifty people immediately signed up together, vying to join the war. After review, forty-one people were qualified, but the task only required a few. At the mobilization meeting in Nandong Village, before the chairman finished speaking, more than forty people rushed out, shouting "Sign up! Sign up!" In Xiguxian, after forty men signed up, Ma Juzhe and three other women also wanted to sign up, urgently shouting, "It won't do if you don't let us sign up! Even if we can't carry guns, we can go to the front as nurses!" In Dingliu Village, among those vying to sign up, some landlords who were targets of struggle also signed up. The masses shouted loudly, "We'll overturn the stone slabs ourselves, we don't want struggle targets, tell him to get lost!" They all clamored, "We want to cross the river to join the war, we can't let these bad eggs go!" Jinling signed up despite his wife being in confinement. When everyone tried to dissuade him, he said anxiously, "I must go!" Feng Chouze from Sima Village said, "I have been emancipated, I am willing to join the war, I won't come back for two years if necessary!" Old man Feng Chunhao, who was sixty years old, said, "Even if I can't carry a gun, I can be a cook!" Under his influence, twenty-two young and strong men signed up. According to statistics from fifteen villages including Wang Henan and Dong Xinyi, three hundred and forty-nine people signed up to join the war, exceeding the task by two hundred and four.
