The People's counter-offensive forces on all fronts, both north and south, have achieved successive victories in the week from the 16th to the 22nd. Important cities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, such as Changchun, Jilin, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou, are all under siege on all sides. Key areas such as Shenyang, Xuzhou, Xi'an, and Hankou are constantly under serious threat from the People's Liberation Army. Echoing these victories, the people in the vast newly liberated areas between the Huai and Han Rivers are increasingly rising up to establish their own government, distribute land and grain, and fight against traitors and seek revenge, forming a mighty tide of joint military-civilian combat. The growing strength and activity of the People's armed forces in the vast areas south of the Yangtze River, behind Chiang Kai-shek's lines, have also been reported successively at this time, and Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis is becoming increasingly serious.

    Northeast Battlefield: Since the autumn offensive, while the Democratic Allied Forces were bloodying Chen Cheng around Shenyang, western Liaoning, and along the Beining Railway, another powerful force suddenly struck the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the Jilin-Changchun area. In the three days of the 17th, 18th, and 20th, the Democratic Allied Forces successively captured important railway station strongholds on the Jilin-Changchun line such as Jiutai, Huapichang, and Qipanjie, cutting off railway traffic between Jilin and Changchun. They also captured the cities of Nong'an and Dehui in the protruding area north of Changchun, and key towns such as Wulajie and Jiuzhan on the outskirts of Jilin, gradually tightening the close encirclement of Changchun and Jilin. On the central front, the Democratic Allied Forces counterattacked the enemy invading from Siping, and on the 16th, they annihilated the entire 150th Regiment of the 50th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's New First Army in Jijiapu, east of Bamiencheng, capturing and killing as many as 3,000 enemies, including the deputy regimental commander Hu Daosheng. On the western front, after capturing Zhangwu and Xinlitun, part of the Democratic Allied Forces continued to expand their offensive, capturing Fuxin, a heavy industrial center in eastern Rehe, and Xinqiu Station on the 17th, capturing and killing more than 1,400 local enemy soldiers including the commander of the 51st Division, Tang Baohuang. Throughout the Northeast battlefield, the offensive of the Democratic Allied Forces continues to develop.

    Shandong Battlefield: After the victory in southern Changyi, the People's Liberation Army on the Jiaodong front continued to pursue the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, capturing the cities of Qixia and Muping in succession. The People's Liberation Army in central Shandong captured Zhucheng in one fell swoop on the 15th, annihilating all the defending enemies and killing and capturing more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits and local reactionaries. Our army has now closed the gate to Jiaodong tightly, and the remnants of Fan Hanjie's Jiaodong Corps of the enemy, deeply trapped in Jiaodong, are in an increasingly precarious situation. To cooperate with the Jiaodong operations, our Bohai forces continued to advance eastward, capturing Qidong and then the three cities of Boxing, Qingcheng, and Guangrao in succession. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled at the sound of the wind. The Liberation Army in the southern Shandong mountainous area, in coordination with the local armed forces, captured Feixian and advanced on Tengxian, compressing the enemy into a narrow area on both sides of the railway. The southern Shandong mountainous area has now been completely liberated. More than 100,000 militiamen in the Yimeng mountainous area constantly and proactively attacked the enemy, destroying the Bo(shan)-Lai(wu), Zhang(qiu)-Lai(wu), and Qing(zhou)-Lin(yi) highways, and removing a number of strongholds along the way. The enemy-occupied parts of the cities have become isolated islands surrounded by our vast countryside. The current situation in Shandong has changed entirely, and even reporters from the New York Times in the United States have had to acknowledge the strength of the Shandong People's Liberation Army, expressing discouragement over Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda of "victory."

    Hubei-Henan-Anhui Battlefield: The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Route Army recaptured the two county towns of Tongcheng and Lujiang on the 14th, annihilating and capturing part of the Youth Army; another Southern Route Army annihilated 2,000 enemies in Liuzigang, east of Huangpi in eastern Hubei. Under the victorious operations of our army, seventeen patriotic and democratic county governments have been established in the Dabie Mountains, and county, district, and township governments are being gradually established. A large number of cadres have been dispatched to the countryside to mobilize the masses to distribute land and grain. Local masses have gathered to carry out struggles against traitors and seek revenge. Poor peasant groups and peasant associations have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. In many places, the masses have spontaneously put forward the slogans of distributing grain in the autumn harvest and distributing land after the autumn harvest.

    Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui Battlefield: Our Liberation Army has been continuously traversing and maneuvering in the vast battlefield stretching nearly a thousand miles from the border of Jiangsu and Anhui in the east to near the Pinghan Railway in the west, pressing on Zhengzhou in the west and Xuzhou in the east. On the 14th, it also recaptured Yingshang County in northern Anhui, annihilating a part of the enemy county brigade. It is now mobilizing the masses to establish vast democratic base areas in the Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui region.

    Henan-Shaanxi Battlefield: After smashing the enemy's 5th Corps offensive, the People's Liberation Army on the eastern route of Henan and Shaanxi took advantage of the victory to advance since the beginning of this month, reaching the outskirts of Luoyang and shelling the city with artillery. On the night of Double Ten Day, our army once entered the Datun Barracks and the western suburbs, only three miles from the city, killing and wounding 700 bandits. Another large force captured the two cities of Yanshi and Mengjin in succession between the 11th and 12th, and Luoyang was surrounded on all sides. Currently, from Heishiguan in the east to Tongguan in the west, except for the isolated stronghold of Luoyang, we have controlled more than 400 miles of the railway line. Another part of our army liberated Yichuan County on the 13th and recaptured Yiyang. Our army is now pressing on Tongguan in the west, advancing into southern Shaanxi, and supporting the victorious advance of the Northwest Liberation Army in the Guanzhong area. In the east, it is besieging Luoyang, threatening Zhengzhou, and further disrupting the fragmented Central Plains battlefield of Chiang Kai-shek.

    Northwest Battlefield: After the victories of Qingjian and Hancheng, the enemy trapped in Yan'an was frightened by the counter-offensive power of the Liberation Army, and the morale of the army became even more panicked. Scarecrows were planted all over the hills in the suburbs, disguised as sentries. Our guerrillas are active in the suburbs of Yan'an. Hu Zongnan, who is at the end of his rope, is worried day and night about the sudden arrival of a new attack by the Northwest People's Liberation Army.

    Jin-Cha-Ji Battlefield: After our army recovered Yongqing, it continued to strike at the enemy in the area north of the Daqing River. The suburbs of Tianjin and Beijing are under attack by our guerrillas.

    In addition, according to news received this week, the vast People's armed forces behind Chiang Kai-shek's lines in various provinces south of the Yangtze River and on Hainan Island, encouraged by the victorious counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army, are becoming increasingly active, striking at the Chiang Kai-shek bandits everywhere, mobilizing the masses, opening granaries to provide relief, and launching a surging anti-Chiang Kai-shek struggle of armed resistance to conscription and grain requisition. The People's armed forces in southern Anhui have captured the towns of Jingxian and Maolin in succession. The People's armed forces in eastern and western Zhejiang have controlled the vast countryside of more than 20 counties, attacking Chiang Kai-shek's township offices and self-defense forces everywhere, seizing a large number of enemy weapons to strengthen themselves. The Beijing-Hangzhou Highway and the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway have also been cut off by the People's Army in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The People's armed forces in central and southern Fujian have successfully joined forces in the continuous victories and have greatly developed. The People's Army on the border of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi, and on the Leizhou Peninsula are also extremely active. In addition to controlling the vast countryside, the People's armed forces on Hainan Island have also occupied important towns such as Baoting, Baisha, and Ledong, and are continuing to expand the controlled areas.

　　蒋匪危机益深重
  　长吉洛郑处于被围状态
  　江南人民武装震撼敌后
    十六日至二十二日一周来，南北各线人民反攻大军节节胜利，长春、吉林、洛阳、郑州等蒋匪重要城市，皆处于四面被围状态；沈阳、徐州、西安、汉口等要地，随时感受人民解放军的严重威胁。与这胜利相辉映的，是江淮河汉之间广大新解放区域人民，日益奋起为建立自己的政权，分田分粮及反奸复仇而斗争，巍为军民联合战斗的巨潮。而长江以南广大地区蒋后人民武装的日益壮大与活跃，亦在这时陆续传来，蒋匪的军事危机是愈来愈为深重了。
    东北战场：秋季攻势以来，民主联军于沈阳外围、辽西及北宁沿线打得陈诚头破血流之时，另一强大部队的铁拳，又突然降落在吉长地区蒋匪头上，十七、十八及二十日三天内，民主联军相继攻克吉长路九台、桦皮厂、棋盘街等重要车站据点，截断吉长间铁路交通，并攻克长春以北突出地带之农安、德惠两城及吉林外围的乌拉街、九站等重镇，逐渐压缩对长春与吉林之紧密包围圈。中线民主联军反击四平出犯之敌，十六日于八面城以东季家堡，一举歼灭蒋匪新一军五十师的一五○团全部，歼俘敌副团长胡道生以下达三千人。西线民主联军一部，于攻克彰武、新立屯后，继续扩张攻势，于十七日攻克热东重工业中心阜新及新邱车站，歼俘敌地方军五十一师师长唐保黄以下一千四百余人。整个东北战场，民主联军的攻势仍在继续发展中。
    山东战场：胶东前线人民解放军自昌南大捷后，继续追击蒋匪，连克栖霞、牟平两城。鲁中人民解放军则于十五日一举攻克诸城，将守敌全部歼灭，毙俘蒋匪土顽三千余人。现我军已将胶东大门关紧，深陷胶东残缺不全的敌范汉杰部胶东兵团，处境日益危殆。渤海我军为配合胶东作战，续向东推进，继克齐东后，又连下博兴、青城、广饶三城，蒋匪闻风逃遁。鲁南山区解放军在地方武装配合下，攻克费县，进逼滕县，将敌压缩于铁路两侧狭窄地带，鲁南山区刻已完全光复。沂蒙山区我十余万民兵，不断主动袭敌，破击博（山）莱（芜）、章（邱）莱（芜）、青（州）临（沂）公路，并拔除沿路若干据点。敌占之部分城市，已成为我广大乡村包围中之伶丁孤岛。目前山东局势已整个改观，连美国纽约时报的记者也不得不承认山东人民解放军的强大。而对蒋匪的“胜利”宣传表示泄气了。
    鄂豫皖战场：人民解放军东路大军，十四日再度光复桐城、庐江两县城，歼俘青年军一部；另部南路大军，则于鄂东黄陂以东之柳子港歼敌两千。在我军胜利作战下，刻大别山区已建立十七个爱国民主县政府，各县区乡政府亦渐次成立，大批干部分派下乡发动群众，进行分田分粮，当地群众已纷纷集会进行反奸复仇斗争，贫农小组、农会如雨后春笋陆续成立起来，很多地方群众也自动提出秋收分粮，秋后分田的行动口号。
    苏鲁豫皖战场：我解放军连日纵横驰骋于东起苏皖边境，西至平汉路近千里的广大战场，西迫郑州，东至徐州，十四日又光复皖北之颖上县城，歼敌县大队一部。刻正发动群众建立苏鲁豫皖地区的广大民主根据地。
    豫陕战场：豫陕东路人民解放军，于粉碎敌第五兵团之攻势后，自本月初起乘胜推进，直抵洛阳城郊，并以排炮轰击城内，双十节夜我军曾攻入距城仅三里之大屯兵场西工及西关，毙伤匪七百余人。另路大军于十一、十二两日间，连克偃师、孟津两城，洛阳四面被围。刻东起黑石关，西至潼关间，除洛阳孤立据点外，我已控制铁路线四百余里，另部我军于十三日解放伊川县城，并再克宜阳。现我军西逼潼关，挺进陕南，策应了大关中西北解放军的胜利进军；东围洛阳，威胁郑州，使蒋匪支离破碎的中原战场更加混乱。
    西北战场：清涧、韩城大捷后，困守延安之敌，慑于解放大军反攻威力，军心更为慌乱，市郊山头遍札草人，伪装警戒，我游击队活跃延安市郊，穷途末路的胡匪宗南，日夜在担忧西北人民解放军新的打击的突然来临。
    晋察冀战场：我军于收复永清后，继续在大清河以北地区打击敌人，平津近郊时在我游击队攻袭之下。
    此外，据本周所得消息，长江以南各省及海南岛地区蒋后广大人民武装，在人民解放军胜利反攻的鼓舞下，益形活跃，到处打击蒋匪，发动群众，开仓济贫，掀起汹涌澎湃的武装抗丁、抗粮的反蒋斗争。皖南人民武装并连克泾县、茂林等城镇，浙东、浙西人民武装控制二十余县的广大农村，到处袭击蒋匪乡公所、自卫队，大量收缴敌人武器壮大自己。京杭公路、杭徽公路亦被苏浙两省民军切断。福建闽中、闽南各地人民武装，在不断的获得胜利中，胜利会师，并有了极大的发展。粤桂赣边境及雷州半岛民军也极活跃。海南岛人民武装于控制广大乡村外，并已攻占保亭、白沙、乐东等重要城镇，并在继续扩大控制区。
