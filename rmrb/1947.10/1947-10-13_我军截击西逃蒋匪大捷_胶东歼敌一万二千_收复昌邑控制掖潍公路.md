Xinhua News Agency, East China Eastern Front, Urgent Telegram, 11th: The Eastern Front of the East China People's Liberation Army has achieved its first unprecedented great victory on the Jiaodong Front. From the 3rd to the 9th of this month, in the Changnan (south of Changyi) area, it fiercely attacked the entire Kuomintang reorganized 64th Division, the entire reorganized 9th Division, and the 211th and 212th Brigades of the reorganized 45th Division, which were fleeing from east to west. After six days and nights of fierce fighting, by the night of the 9th, more than 12,000 enemy troops had been annihilated, including over 8,000 captured alive, including Zhang Zhongzhong, commander of the 211th Brigade of the 45th Division.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Eastern Front, 11th: The headquarters of the Eastern Front Corps of the East China People's Liberation Army has just issued its first communique stating that the Kuomintang bandit Jiaodong Corps under Fan Hanjie, blindly and adventurously invading our Jiaodong Liberated Area, has suffered repeated blows from our army and people, suffering heavy casualties, extended battle lines, and dispersed forces. By September 30th, when our army took the initiative to withdraw from Yantai, the Kuomintang army's blind offensive had reached its peak. Deeply fearing being annihilated one by one by our army, and in a desperate attempt to retreat south to participate in containing the powerful offensive of our various counter-offensive armies, the reorganized 64th Division leading two brigades (159th Brigade and 131st Brigade) and the entire reorganized 9th Division began to flee west at the beginning of this month. In order to resolutely annihilate the enemy within Shandong Province, our army took preemptive action. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival (September 29th), a strong force marched north, sweeping over 60 li of the Gao (mi) Wei (xian) section of the Jiaoji Railway, annihilating over 1,000 enemies. Subsequently, it advanced rapidly northward, cutting off the Kuomintang army's westward retreat route. First, on the 4th of this month, it annihilated the entire 477th Regiment of the 159th Brigade, the vanguard of the enemy's 64th Division, at Sanhushan, 50 li southeast of Changyi. The next day (the 5th), it annihilated the entire 475th Regiment of the brigade at Linjia Village, on the southern foothills of Sanhushan. Only the brigade headquarters' directly subordinate units escaped into Fanjiaji, east of Linjia Village, and jointly defended the village with the 64th Division headquarters and the entire 131st Brigade, awaiting reinforcements. On the 6th, our army annihilated the entire first battalion of the 393rd Regiment of the 131st Brigade on the southeastern outskirts of Fanjiaji. At the same time, another main force of our army fiercely pursued the entire reorganized 9th Division, which was fleeing along the same route as the 64th Division. From the 6th to the 8th, in the three days, it annihilated over 2,000 troops of the division in the area north of Tingkou (located about 50 li north of Gaomi, on the Gaomi-Pingdu highway), including the first battalion of the 227th Regiment of the 76th Brigade and another battalion (number to be verified). The Kuomintang army, suffering this crushing defeat, was panic-stricken and hastily ordered the 212th Brigade headquarters of the 45th Division, which was originally in the Jiao (xian) Gao (mi) area, to lead five battalions, and the remnants of the 156th Brigade of the 64th Division, which was originally in Zhucheng (note: the brigade had been annihilated by 2,000 in the Zhucheng battle on the 11th of last month), to reinforce from the southeast to the northwest to the area southeast of Zhuyang (about 50 li northwest of Gaomi on the railway line); it also ordered the entire 211th Brigade of the 45th Division (missing one battalion), which was originally in the Changle and Weixian areas, to reinforce from the west to the east to the Yinma (about 60 li southeast of Changyi) line, attempting to meet the reorganized 64th Division and the reorganized 9th Division in two routes to seize the road to the west. Our frontline soldiers fought more and more bravely. On the 8th, they first annihilated the entire 211th Brigade (missing one battalion) of the western route reinforcement 45th Division, more than 6,000 troops, at Shanyangzhuang, west of Yinma, capturing alive more than 4,000, including their brigade commander and regimental commander. On the same day at dusk, another main force annihilated two battalions of the 468th Regiment of the 156th Brigade of the southern route reinforcement 64th Division at Zhengjiazhuang, east of Zhuyang. On the same day, our northern route troops also recovered the county seat of Changyi, completely controlling the Yewe (Yexian-Weixian) section of the Yan (tai) Wei (xian) Highway. In total, from the 3rd to the 9th, we annihilated two regiments (477th Regiment and 475th Regiment) of the 159th Brigade of the Kuomintang army's 64th Division and one battalion (1st Battalion of the 393rd Regiment) of the 131st Brigade of the division, and two battalions of the 156th Brigade (1st and 2nd Battalions of the 468th Regiment), the entire 211th Brigade of the 45th Division (brigade headquarters and its 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments, missing one battalion), and two battalions of the reorganized 9th Division (1st Battalion of the 227th Regiment of the 76th Brigade and another battalion), totaling more than 12,000 enemy officers and soldiers killed, wounded, and captured, including over 8,000 captured alive, including Zhang Zhongzhong, commander of the 221st Brigade of the 45th Division. A large number of military supplies and weapons were seized and are being inventoried.

Currently, the headquarters of the 64th Division, the headquarters of the 159th Brigade, and the entire 131st Brigade (one battalion annihilated) are being besieged in an isolated village, Fanjiaji, on the southern foothills of Sanhushan. The entire reorganized 9th Division (two battalions annihilated) is hovering in the area east of Sanhushan, about 20 li, east of Xin'an, Taitou, and Hongshishan, in a dilemma. The 212th Brigade headquarters of the 45th Division, as well as its five battalions and the 156th Brigade headquarters of the 64th Division, with the remnants of its 466th Regiment, and only one remaining battalion of the 468th Regiment, are all hovering in the area of Guanzhuang and Xuejiaji, east of Zhuyang, and are now in an environment where they can neither fight nor dare to leave. They do not know when the fate of being annihilated will fall upon them. The entire lineup of the Kuomintang bandit army in Jiaodong, after this heavy blow, has fallen into a state of disintegration.

　　我军截击西逃蒋匪大捷
  　胶东歼敌一万二千
  　收复昌邑控制掖潍公路
    【新华社华东东线十一日急电】华东解放军东线大军于胶东前线创首次空前大捷。自本月三日至九日，在昌南（昌邑以南）地区痛击由东向西逃窜之蒋军整编六十四师全部，整编九师全部及整编四十五师之二一一、二一二两个旅等部，激战六昼夜，迄九日夜止，已歼敌一万二千余名，其中生俘四十五师二一一旅旅长张中忠以下八千余名。
    【新华社华东东线十一日电】华东解放军东线兵团指挥部顷发表第一号公报称：盲目冒险进犯我胶东解放区的蒋匪胶东兵团范汉杰部，自遭我军民迭次打击，伤亡惨重，战线延长，兵力分散，至九月三十日我军主动撤离烟台时，蒋军盲目攻势已达顶点，深惧被我各个歼灭，并急图南撤参加遏止我各路反攻大军之强大攻势，整六十四师率两个旅（一五九旅及一三一旅）及整九师全部，乃于本月初开始西逃。我军为坚决歼敌于山东境内，乃先发制敌，于中秋之夜（上月二十九）开始以劲旅一部，挥戈北上，横扫胶济路高（密）潍（县）段六十余里，歼敌千余。继即向北疾进，一举截断蒋军西逃路线，首于本月四日将敌六十四师之前卫旅一五九旅之四七七团全部歼灭于昌邑东南五十里之三户山。次日（五日）复将该旅之四七五团全部歼灭于三户山南麓之林家村。仅该旅旅部直属队逃入林家村以东之范家集，与六十四师师部及一三一旅全部共同固守该村待援。六日我军复于范家集东南郊扑灭一三一旅三九三团之第一营全部，与此同时，我军另部主力猛追与六十四师同路，逃之整九师全部，自六日至八日，三天中先后在亭口（位于高密正北约五十里，高密至平度公路上）以北地区，歼该师二千余名、其中包括该师七十六旅二二七团之第一营及另一个营（番号待查）。蒋军遭此惨败，仓惶失措，乃急令其原在胶（县）高（密）地区之四五师二一二旅旅部率五个营及原在诸城之六十四师一五六旅残部（按该旅已于上月十一日诸城战斗中被歼两千余），由东南向西北增援，至朱阳（高密西北约五十里铁路线上）东南地带；又令其原在昌乐、潍县地区之四十五师二一一旅全部（缺一个营）由西向东增援至饮马（昌邑东南约六十里）一线，企图两路接应整六十四师及整九师，夺路西逃。我前线将士愈战愈猛，于八日首先全部扑灭西路援军四十五师之二一一旅（缺一个营）全部六千余，于饮马以西之山阳庄，生擒其旅长、团长以下四千余。复于同日黄昏以另部主力歼灭南路援军六十四师一五六旅四六八团之两个营于朱阳以东之郑家庄，我北路部队亦于同日收复昌邑县城，完全控制烟（台）潍（县）公路之掖（县）潍（县）段。总计自三日至九日，我共歼蒋军六十四师一五九旅之两个团（四七七团及四七五团）及该师一三一旅之一个营（三九三团第一营），和一五六旅之两个营（四六八团之第一营与第二营），四十五师之二一一旅全部（旅部及所属之一、二、三团，缺一个营），整九师两个营（七十六旅二二七团之第一营及另一个营），共毙伤俘敌官兵一万二千余名，其中生俘四十五师二二一旅旅长张中忠以下八千余名，缴获大批军火武器，正清查中。
    现蒋军六十四师师部、一五九旅旅部、及一三一旅全部（被歼一个营）正被围于三户山南麓范家集一个孤村，整九师全部（被歼两个营）则徘徊于三户山以东，约二十里之辛安、台头、红石山以东一线，进退维谷，而有如惊弓之鸟的四十五师之二一二旅旅部，及所属之五个营及六十四师之一五六旅旅部，与所属之四六六团残部，与四六八团仅剩之一个营，则一起徘徊于朱阳以东的官庄、薛家集一带，现正处于既不能战又不敢走的环境，他们不知道被歼的命运将于何时落到自己头上，而胶东蒋匪军的整个阵容经此惨重打击，已陷于支离破碎之境地。
