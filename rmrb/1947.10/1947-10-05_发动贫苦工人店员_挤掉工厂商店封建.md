    In Jincheng Chengguan District, workers, shop assistants, and the poor were mobilized to investigate and seal off the "air-raid shelters" of the landlord class. Several issues were raised during the movement that lasted for over ten days:

    I. Only by mobilizing the suffering people can we thoroughly investigate.
    The district convened a meeting of village cadres and activists to discuss and study the investigation of feudalism through worker-peasant unity. On the same day, several streets detained the targets of struggle. After only two or three days, the old cadres and activists clamored: "Let's struggle! Why haven't we struggled yet? The masses are demanding struggle." So, West Street struggled against Ding Shengmin, and Yihou Street also held a meeting to struggle against Yan Zhanyuan. During the struggle, workers from factories and shop assistants from stores participated. A few of them were very active, but the main force was still the old activists. At the struggle meeting against Yan Zhanyuan in Yihou Street, the atmosphere was relatively calm, and not many people spoke.

    Why was it that although there was a demand for struggle, only a few of the original activists were active at the struggle meeting? It was because the workers, shop assistants, and peasants who were truly the most oppressed, exploited, and suffering still dared not speak up. A new activist from West Street said: "Old cadres cannot penetrate people's hearts. New cadres must be brought in so they can discover new people who haven't been emancipated. It won't work with just old cadres." This enlightened us that if we want the movement to be deep and widespread, we must mobilize the poorest workers, shop assistants, and peasants. Therefore, at the beginning of the movement, our task should be how to mobilize those who are silent.

    II. Find the poor first, then find feudalism.

    In the first ten days of the movement, some streets organized investigation teams to find feudalism, some went door-to-door to investigate feudalism, and some worried about not being able to find feudalism. District cadres then held a meeting to study and emphasized that work should be thorough. The district cadres and village cadres working in Yihou Street held a meeting together and reviewed the reasons why the movement had not taken off. They concluded that the reason was that the masses had not been called upon to act. So, they were determined to go deeper and find the poor. They found Ma Minggen, an apprentice barber, Cui Hugou, a shoe repairer, Zhou Chunbao, a restaurant waiter, and Zhai Angen, among the poorest people, and had several heart-to-heart talks with them. Later, they gathered more than a dozen of them together to talk about their past experiences. However, they did not dare to speak boldly with the district cadres present. So, the district cadres went outside and quietly hid outside the window to listen. They then opened up: Zhou Chunbao's father was beaten to death by a traitor in the village when the Japanese devils were there, and Ma Minggen had been a waiter in Xinghua Pond for several years and had never received a penny. After complaining, the cadres asked: "You all have grievances. Do you dare to fight or not?" Everyone was silent again. The cadres then asked, "Why are you poor?" Some said: "I have grievances in the village, but not in the city." So the cadres asked again, "If a yellow wolf bites your family members, will you fight the gray wolf when you see it?" This reminded everyone, and their spirits rose, saying, "We must do it." From this process of complaining and ideological enlightenment, they found out where feudalism was and where the "air-raid shelters" of the landlord class were. So the cadres put forward "Find the poor first, not feudalism first." West Street cadres also proposed from their work experience "Investigate our own people." From then on, the leadership clearly and definitely pointed out: Only by finding the poor can we find feudalism. We must mobilize the most oppressed, most exploited, and poorest workers, shop assistants, and the poor to block the "air-raid shelters" of the landlord class and thoroughly eliminate feudalism. Now, all streets are carrying out complaint movements. From the complaints of this group of poor people, masses who had not been mobilized in past mass movements have been discovered. The current movement is therefore deepening.

    III. Coordinate from top to bottom for thoroughness and cleanliness.

    Mobilizing workers, shop assistants, and waiters from the bottom up to investigate feudalism is fundamental, but breaking through the thinking of cadres and all personnel in factories and shops from the top down and letting them consciously and voluntarily block "air-raid shelters" is a comprehensive movement to thoroughly block "air-raid shelters" when done in coordination from top to bottom. Detaihe and Yuhua stores are models for all public factories and stores in this investigation of feudalism. Yuhua also coordinated the mobilization of workers and shop assistants in their factory and store to complain, which was very effective. The reason for their success is that they started by breaking through the thinking of all personnel, conducted ideological investigations, and studied land reform. This made everyone aware of why they should cleanse the targets of struggle and consciously and voluntarily block the "air-raid shelters" of the landlord class. (Taiyue Branch News Agency)

　　发动贫苦工人店员
  　挤掉工厂商店封建
    少舍
    晋城城关区发动工人伙计和贫民起来查封建堵塞地主阶级的“防空洞”，在十几天的运动中，提出了几个问题：
    一、发动苦人才能查清。
    区上召集村干部和积极分子会，讨论研究了工农团结查封建，当天回去，有几个街就把斗争对象扣起来，刚过两三天，旧的干部和积极分子就急嚷着：“斗争吧！还不斗？群众都要求斗争。”于是西街斗了丁胜民，驿后街也就开会斗争阎占元。在斗争中，工厂的工人参加了，商店的店员和小伙计也参加了，他们中也有少数的表现很积极，但主要的还是旧有的积极分子在活动。驿后街斗争阎占元的会场上，总是比较冷静，没有多少人说话。
    为什么既有斗争的要求，而在斗争会上只是几个原有的积极分子活动呢？那就是真正最受压迫，最受剥削，最痛苦的工人伙计和农民还不敢吭气。西街的新积极分子说：“老干部不能打入人心，叫新干部钻进去，新干部才能发现新的没翻身的人，光老干部干不行”。这就启发了我们，要想运动深入广泛，必须把最贫苦的工人伙计和农民发动起来，所以当运动一开始，我们的任务应是如何去发动那些不吭气的人。
    二、先找穷人后找封建。
    在前十天的运动中，有的街组织调查小组去找封建，有的挨门挨户去调查封建，有的发愁找不着封建。区干部就开会研究，强调工作要深入。在驿后街工作的区干部和村干部在一起开会，检讨出运动没搞起来的原因是没有叫群众起来干，于是就下定决心深入下去，找穷苦人，一找就找到理发师学徒马明根、掌鞋的崔虎狗、饭馆的小伙计周春保与翟安根等最穷苦的人，和他们拉了几次家常话。后就召集了他们十几个人在一块拉拉自己已往的事；可是区干部在面前他们不敢大胆说，区干部就出门外悄悄躲在窗外听，他们就拉开了：周春保的父亲是日寇在时被村里的汉奸打死的，马明根在兴华池塘做了几年伙计，就没得过一个钱。诉苦后干部提出：“大家有苦你们敢斗不敢斗”，大家又静悄悄的不吭气了。干部又提出“你们为什么穷”，有的说：“我在村里有苦，在城里没有”，于是干部又问“黄狼咬了你家里人，你看到灰狼打不打”，这样提醒了大家，劲头起来了，说“非搞不可”。从这诉苦和思想启发过程中，他们就找出了封建在那里，那里是地主阶级的“防空洞”，于是干部就提出“先找穷人不先找封建”，西街干部也从工作经验中提出“查自己人”。从此领导上就明确肯定的指出：只有找到穷苦人才能找到封建，必须把最受压迫最受剥削的最贫苦的工人伙计和贫民发动起来，才能堵塞地主阶级的“防空洞”，也才能彻底消灭封建。现在各街都在进行诉苦运动。从这批穷人诉苦中，就发现了在过去群众运动中未发动过的群众，目前的运动也就正在深入开展。
    三、上下配合彻底干净。
    查封建从下而上的发动工人、店员和伙计是基本的，但从上而下的打通工厂、商店的干部，及一切人员的思想，让他们自觉自动的堵塞“防空洞”，这样上下配合起来干，才是全面的彻底堵塞“防空洞”的运动。德泰和、豫华商店在这次查封建中是各公营工厂商店的模范，豫华还配合发动他们工厂商店的工人伙计诉苦，收效很大，他们好的原因是从打通一切人员的思想入手，进行查思想，学习土地改革，这就使每个人员都知道为什么要清洗斗争对象，自觉自愿的来堵塞地主阶级“防空洞”（太岳分社）
