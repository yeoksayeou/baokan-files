　　Tan Village Promptly Solves Problems
    Entire Village Completes Wheat Planting Plan
    [Our Jilu Yu Dispatch, 28th] Tan Village, in the Fifth District of Nanfeng, promptly discovered and solved problems, and has now completed its wheat planting plan. Since the full village wheat planting conference on August 24th of the lunar calendar, the village checked the plowing and wheat land conditions and arranged the planting. At that time, only three families had wheat drills, and only 20 mu had been sown. On the morning of the second day of the conference, the masses repaired drills and installed rollers, and fifteen wheat planting groups began to organize manpower to pull drills and rollers. The comrades of the village stationed institutions brought two animals to help cultivate, and a total of 27 mu of wheat was drilled and 37.5 mu of land was rolled. The female comrades of the institutions all participated in pulling drills and rollers. Every night, the village working group of the institution met with the village cadres once to understand the wheat planting and land drilling situation of the day. Every three days, the wheat planting group leaders, village cadres, and the institution's village working group gathered for a summary. At the first summary meeting, it was calculated that the village had planted a total of 449 mu of wheat. Among the fifteen wheat planting groups, two groups had finished plowing and planting. From this summary meeting, the following situations were discovered: (1) Village cadres finished planting before the general masses; (2) Middle peasants and activists finished plowing or drilling before poor peasants; (3) Some village cadres took better care of cadres' family members than the general poor peasants and military dependents, prioritizing them; (4) At the beginning, the power was not fully mobilized, and the children's corps and sisters' groups were not organized to participate in wheat planting. According to the above problems, the task for the next three days was proposed: First, adjust the forces to plant wheat and roll land for the three most difficult groups and military dependents. The sisters' group went to each house to grind flour, and the children's corps of six people formed a rolling group. As a result, four groups rolled 51 mu of land, and the sisters' group ground 8 dou and 5 sheng of flour in two days, ensuring that each family had flour to eat during the wheat planting period without using animal power to grind. At the second summary meeting on the sixth day (14th), a total of 663 mu of wheat had been planted; in addition, 62.5 mu that had been plowed and harrowed could be drilled within two days, and there were still 37.5 mu being plowed. According to this summary, it was still far from the required number of wheat planting. After checking the land area and household registration, it was found that there were still 122.5 mu of land that had not been distributed (stored by the farmers' association, planted by the school, not in the mutual aid group, and 86 mu of land belonging to five landlords). At the meeting, a debate was launched on the issue of landlords planting wheat. The result was that landlords must be asked to plant wheat on their land, and they were allowed to borrow spare animals. The five landlords planned to plant 58.5 mu, and Liuchun planned to plant 27.5 mu. The Farmers' Association now organized animals to plant the land of households who had gone out (going to Guandong). The village organized forces to help the four households not in the group (one was a 70-year-old man, one was a 16-year-old child, who had gone to the hospital to recruit wounded soldiers, and one was a poor peasant with sores) to drill and plant wheat after they raised their specific difficulties. At the third summary on the 19th of this month, the village originally planned to plant 9 qing of wheat, but as a result, 908.2 mu were planted.

　　谭庄及时解决问题
    全村完成种麦计划
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】南峰五区谭庄及时发现与解决问题，现已完成种麦计划。该村自从旧历八月二十四日，开了全村群众种麦大会，检查了犁麦地情况与布置种麦，当时耩麦的只有三家，下种也不过二十亩，大会的第二天早晨，群众就修理耧、安砘子，十五个种麦组开始组织人力拉耧、拉砘子。驻村机关同志带两个牲口助耕，共耩麦二十七亩，砘地三十七亩半，机关的女同志都参加了拉耧拉砘子。每天晚上，机关驻村工作组同村干碰头一次，了解当天种麦耩地情形，每三天集合种麦组长、村干与机关驻村工作组，作一次小结。第一次小结时，计全村共种麦有四百四十九亩，十五个种麦组，有两个组已耕完种完。从这次小结会上，发现有下面几种情况：（一）村干先于一般群众种完；（二）中农、积极分子，先于贫农耕完或耩完；（三）有的村干，对于干部家属照顾，比对一般贫农军属的周到，分先后；（四）开始力量未充分发动起来，儿童团、姐妹团未组织到种麦里边去。根据上述问题提出下三天的任务：第一调剂力量，给最困难的三个组及军属种麦、砘地，姐妹团到各家去磨面，儿童团六人为一拉砘小组，结果四个组，拉了五十一亩地，姐妹团两天磨面八斗五升，保证了各家种麦期间不用畜力拉磨有面吃。第六天（十四日）晚上再开小结会，共计已种麦子六百六十三亩；此外耕好耙好两天内可以耩上的六十二亩半，还有正在耕着的三十七亩半。根据这次小结，离种麦要求数尚远，经过检查地亩与户口，发现还有没分下去的地一百二十二亩半（有农会保存，学校种的，未在互助组的及五户地主的八十六亩地），会上并对地主种麦问题展开争论，结果是地主地要叫他种麦，有空的牲口准许他借，五家地主计划种五十八亩半，留春地二十七亩半。农会现有外出户（走关东）的地，组织牲口去种，不在组的四户（一户是七十岁的老头，一户是十六岁的孩子，已到医院招护伤号，一户是长疮的贫农），都提出他们家的具体困难，由村上组织力量，帮助他们耩种。到本月十九日三次总结时，全村原计划种九顷麦，结果种了九百零八亩二分。
