　　Jiyuan People Enthusiastically Support the Front
    [Report from Jiyuan by our newspaper] As the People's Liberation Army went south to eliminate the enemy, the people of Jiyuan were overjoyed. More than 30,000 people, disregarding their fatigue, enthusiastically provided support, quickly completing the glorious supply task of 2 million jin of white flour and 3 million jin of firewood (firewood is the most difficult thing to obtain in Jiyuan). When the People's Liberation Army arrived, children and women in Matou Village, Third District, beat gongs and drums to welcome the troops into the village. The people shouted, "Welcome the People's Liberation Army to cross the river and thoroughly eliminate the stubborn Chiang troops!" The troops were moved and saluted the people. As soon as the troops settled in, the women of Dongmatou Village helped cook and make noodles, and the old men brought firewood to the fire and helped carry water. The soldiers were all moved and talked to each other, "The masses treat us so well, we must resolutely abide by mass discipline." The women at the Miaodian reception station in the First District boiled water and lined up twenty jars on the street, with a table and a dozen bowls next to each jar. The jars were filled with hot boiling water, and the women sat in groups of twos and threes, making anti-attack shoes while serving the troops. Xiao Qi's mother in Mapeng Village didn't have any wheat at home, but when she saw others grinding flour for the anti-attack army, she felt really bad, so she ran to her mother's house to borrow wheat and ground 20 jin of white flour to send to the grain station. Xiao Gen, who is over fifty years old, ground grain for the anti-attack army, only sending the first two grindings of white flour to the army, and keeping the dark flour for himself. He said, "I was able to stand up because of the Eighth Route Army, I can't give dark flour to my benefactors." He was over the age for corvée labor, but he asked to deliver grain to the front, and the village cadres couldn't stop him, so they had to let him go. Guo Zhengxuan, the village chief, and the deputy director of the Second District also requested to arrive early at the (Yellow) River to welcome and send off the troops, saying, "That's not accurate, we'll wait until then." In the Jiyuan plain area, firewood is scarce. Children in Gaichu Elementary School in the Seventh District organized themselves to collect firewood, and businessmen also formed a team to collect firewood from places more than 20 li away. They collected it three times, with merchants and children collecting more than 4,000 jin each. The boatmen on the river rowed the boats until their hands were blistered, sleeping on the boats in the rain, covered in mud and water, and cold at night, but they never complained. The Chiang troops fired machine guns from Henan, and they cursed Chiang Kai-shek: "Wait three days until we get over there, then we'll see if you can still fire your mother's machine guns." None of the thousands of militiamen and porters in the stretcher team who participated in the battle to cross the (Yellow) River deserted. Hetou Village in the Third District only had fifteen militiamen, and all of them requested to participate in the battle.賀賀贺光×, an old man in Qucun Village, requested three times to cross the river to participate in the battle, but the village cadres repeatedly dissuaded him, so he went to work as a cook. Seven people in Daxu Village wrote guarantees to participate in the battle, guaranteeing to complete the task and not desert. After the troops crossed the river, the people of Henan passed on the word: "The blue sky and white sun are all over the mountains, the red is developing and the white is not working, the Eighth Route Army is a divine army, they come without being seen, and once they cross the river, Chiang's troops will definitely be finished."

　　济源人民热情支前
    【本报济源讯】解放大军南下，消灭敌军，济源人民听到这一消息，欢腾鼓舞，三万余群众不顾疲劳热烈支援，迅速完成白面二百万斤，柴火三百万斤（柴火在济源是最困难的）的光荣供给任务。当人民解放军到达时，三区马头村儿童妇女群众，打着锣鼓夹道欢迎部队进入村中，人民高呼：“欢迎人民解放军过河彻底消灭蒋顽军！”感动的部队看着正步向人民表示敬礼。东马头村妇女当部队刚住下，就帮助做饭做面条，老汉们把柴火送到火边，并帮助挑水。战士们都被感动了、互相交谈着：“群众待我们这样好，我们坚决遵守群众纪律。”一区苗店招待站的妇女，把水烧好，在街上排起了二十个缸，每个缸边又摆起一张桌子和十几个碗。缸里盛满了热腾腾的开水，妇女们三三两两坐在一旁，一边做着反攻鞋，一边招待部队。马蓬村小启的娘，自己家里没有麦子，见旁人给反攻大军磨面，她心里实在过意不去，就跑到她娘家借麦子回来磨了二十斤白面送到粮站上。现小根五十多岁了，给反攻军磨粮，只把头两遍白面送给军队，黑的留下自己吃，他说：“我是凭八路军翻身的，我不能把黑面给恩人吃。”他的年岁已超过支差年龄，他要求到前方送给粮，村干部阻止不住，只得让他去。二区又添了村长郭正宣和副主任要求提前到达（黄）河迎送，他们说：“这样不确切，还等那时候。源的平原地带，柴火困难，七区的高初小儿童组织起来去拾柴，商人亦抽出一部组织起来，到廿里以外的地方去拾柴，他们连拾三次，商人和儿童各拾四千余斤。河上的船夫摇船把手磨烂，下雨在船上睡觉，又是泥又是水，夜里又冷，他们受这样大的罪，但始终未说过半句怨言。蒋军从河南打机枪，他们大骂蒋介石：“过三天到了那边再说，还打你娘什么机枪。”参战过（黄）河的数千民兵、民夫担架队，没一个开小差的。三区河头村只有十五个民兵，全部要求去参战。曲村贺光×老汉三次要求过河参战，村干部再三劝阻不住，结果他去当火夫做饭。大许村七个人为要参战写下保证书，保证完成任务不开小差。部队过河后，河南人民交口传说：“青天白日满山红，红的发展白的不中，八路军是神兵，不见就来到，过河就有蒋军必定齐完蛋。”（王亮之）
