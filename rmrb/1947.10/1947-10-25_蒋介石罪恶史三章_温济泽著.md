　　Three Chapters of Chiang Kai-shek's History of Crimes
  　Written by Wen Jize
    Chiang Kai-shek's crimes are countless!

    These three chapters are about his gangster behavior in front of tens of thousands of students during the "September 18th Incident," pretending to resist Japan, and then, in less than two months, using secret agents and machine guns to massacre hundreds of students in a bloody history.

    The three stories told here are all from the author's personal experience. From these stories, we can already see Chiang Kai-shek's true form—the biggest and oldest traitor and seller of the country!

　　蒋介石罪恶史三章
  　温济泽著
    蒋介石的罪恶是数不清的！
    这三章是写他在“九一八”时，当着几万学生面前要流氓，假装抗日，不到两个月，他又用特务，机枪屠杀学生数百人的血腥史。
    这里所讲的三个故事，都是作者亲身经过的。从这些故事里，已经可以看出蒋介石的原形——一个最大最老的汉奸卖国贼！
