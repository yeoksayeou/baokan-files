Comparing Harvests to Find Reasons, Explaining Ideology
Yangcheng and Jincheng Launch Crash Autumn Tillage

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Taiyue on the 25th] Since the government issued the call for a crash autumn tillage campaign, Yangcheng, Jincheng, and other counties have successively held meetings to discuss autumn tillage. In both Jincheng and Yangcheng, where two crops are harvested annually, they are currently rushing to plant stubble wheat, but the climate is gradually becoming cold. Therefore, various villages are discussing simultaneously launching a crash autumn tillage. In Shuicun, Yangcheng County, discussions were held at night school. First, the benefits of autumn tillage were discussed. Zhao Jiasheng said: "Last year, the upper and lower plots of land in Niucaogou were both five mu, and planted on the same day. The upper plot belonged to Qian Yuexing and was autumn-tilled last year, so the seedlings were full this year. The lower plot was mine, and it was not tilled last autumn, so the seedlings were only 90% full. Qian Yuexing harvested two shi six dou eight sheng of grain from five mu, while I only harvested one shi three dou, a difference of one shi three dou eight sheng. This year, no matter what, I can't let the autumn tillage be delayed." However, because the weather has already turned cold, in order to quickly organize autumn tillage, it was decided to organize all ninety and a half livestock in the village to participate in autumn tillage, ensuring that all the land would be tilled. After discussion, Hengling Village, in addition to having all the livestock participate in tilling, also adopted the method of organizing women to dig the land when planting wheat to compensate for the lack of livestock. Jiangli Village also mobilized women to participate in autumn tillage. At a meeting on October 20th, a woman named Xiaolin voluntarily proposed that her group of four women would till 40 mu of land, guaranteeing that the tilling would be meticulous and of high quality. Other women's group leaders, such as Zhang Xiaozhua, Guixiang, and Xiaoning, also proposed guaranteeing the tilling of 167 mu of land. Various villages in Jincheng are currently discussing and establishing autumn tillage plans. Yuning Village has already started from the 23rd, with all the village's livestock and all the men and women working together, aiming to complete the autumn tillage within half a month. Shuidong Natural Village has also started.

    阳城晋城突击秋耕
    【本报太岳二十五日电】阳城、晋城等县自政府发出突击秋垡号召后，纷纷开会讨论秋垡。晋、阳两地，年收两季，现正赶种茬麦，但气候已逐渐寒冷，因此各村讨论同时突击秋垡。阳城水村在夜校上展开讨论，首先讨论了秋垡的好处，赵家升说：“去年牛草沟上下两块地，同是五亩，同天种的，上一块是钱月兴的，去年秋垡过，今年就满苗，下块是我的，去秋没有垡地，苗只九成；钱月兴五亩谷打了二石六斗八，我只打了一石三斗，就差下一石三斗八升。今年无论如何可不敢叫误了秋垡地。”但因天气已凉，要迅速组织秋垡，决定把全村九十头半牲口一起组织起来投入秋垡，保证把秋地全部垡过。横岭村在讨论后，除牲口全部参加垡地外，还采用种麦时组织妇女刨地的办法，以补救牲口困难。匠礼村亦发动了妇女参加秋垡，在十月二十日会议上，妇女小林自动提出她组四个妇女会垡地，保证垡地四十亩，并且垡的细，垡的好，其他妇女组长张小抓、桂香、小凝等，也提出保证垡地一百六十七亩。晋城各村现正讨论订立秋垡计划，庾能村已从二十三日起，全村牲口与全村男女一齐动手，要在半月内将秋地垡完。水东自然村亦已开始。
