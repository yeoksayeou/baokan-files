　　Leading Cadres Take the Lead in Self-Reflection; Pay Attention to Solving Ideological Problems:
  　Experience of the Third Review by the Military Directly Under the Fifth Sub-district of Taihang
    [Our Newspaper] The Fifth Sub-district of Taihang's directly subordinate troops, implementing the military region's order, universally launched the Three Check-ups campaign. Through group discussions, many muddled ideas were exposed: For example, some comrades said, "In the past, when military families were struggled against, I felt that the local area didn't provide enough care, only emphasizing that they were military families, regardless of whether they were landlords." Some comrades said, "Village cadres have problems, and sometimes I hate them more than I hate landlords." A cadre from the Fourth Company reflected, "When I saw landlords being struggled against in Leikou Village, I said: 'Local cadres only know how to do this.' When the masses heard this sentence, their enthusiasm for the struggle diminished. Now I realize that I hindered the mass movement." Many cadres expressed remorse for their past thoughts and actions that hindered the mass movement. During the campaign, the following experiences were gained:
    (1) When carrying out the campaign, first clear away two obstacles: (1) The belief that land reform is a local matter, not a military matter, therefore they don't care and are unwilling to study. We must make everyone realize that land reform is the fundamental problem of the current Chinese revolution; our fighting and struggle are all to achieve this goal. (2) Some people believe that they are not landlords and have already turned over, so they think there is no ideological problem and are unwilling to check their thoughts, words, and actions again, which is also wrong. For example, some comrades, although they have turned over, their class consciousness has not improved much, and they still have confused ideas about land reform, unintentionally hindering the mass movement.
    (2) In learning, leading cadres are responsible, take the initiative, set an example, and take the lead in self-reflection, which has a great effect. Deputy Political Commissar Ren and Director Li reported to all cadres how their families exploited the peasants and frankly examined their own thoughts, which had a great impact on the cadres. Some cadres said: "The leaders have already spoken, what are we afraid of?" So they all seriously reflected and examined themselves. In addition, asking local responsible cadres to cooperate and help with learning, and organizing emancipated peasants to report to the troops and provide reflective materials, is very helpful in solving ideological problems.
    (3) In terms of learning steps and methods, first start with specific issues, such as what did you see and hear about the land reform movement, what are your feelings and opinions? Let everyone expose themselves as much as possible, and any dissatisfaction and complaints can be discussed and criticized. If they are frightened by "expulsion from the party" and "handing over to the masses for disposal" at the beginning, they will not be willing to expose themselves, full of praise but inwardly resisting, and ideological problems cannot be solved.

　　首长负责带头反省  注意解决思想问题
  　太行五分区军直三查经验
    【本报讯】太行五分区各直属部队，执行军区命令，普遍展开三查。经过小组讨论，暴露了不少糊涂思想：如有同志说：“过去军属被斗，就感到地方照顾不够，只强调他是军属，不管他是地主，”有的同志说：“村干有毛病，有时恨他比对地主还恨”，四连一个干部反省说：“我在磊口村见到斗争老财，我就说：‘地方干部光会干这一套’，群众听到这句话斗的劲头不大了。现在才知道妨碍了群运。”许多干部对自己过去妨碍群众运动的思想和行动，表示悔恨。运动中，得到以下几点经验：
    （一）在进行时首先清除两个障碍：（１）认为土地改革是地方上的事，不是军队上的事，因此也就不操心，不肯学习，我们必须使大家认识，土地改革是中国革命目前基本问题；我们打仗、斗争，都是为了达到这个目的。（２）有些人认为自己不是地主，并且翻了身，认为思想上毫无问题，不肯再去检查自己的思想、言论、行动，也是不对的，如有些同志虽然他翻了身，但阶级觉悟并未提高多少，对土地改革仍有糊涂观念，在无意中就妨碍了群运。
    （二）在学习上首长负责，亲自动手，以身作则，带头反省，作用很大。任副政委、李主任在全体干部面前报告自己家庭如何剥削农民，坦白的检查自己思想，对干部影响很大，有的干部说：“首长都讲了我们还怕什么？”所以都认真的反省检查。另外请地方负责干部配合与帮助学习，组织翻身农民向部队作报告，提供反省材料，对解决思想问题是很有力的。
    （三）在学习步骤与方法上，首先从具体问题拉起，如你见到听到的土地改革运动是啥样，有啥感觉和意见？使大家尽情暴露，有什么不满和牢骚都可谈出来，进行批判。如果先被“开除党籍”“交群众处理”……等所吓住，都不肯暴露，满口是赞成，内心是抵抗，解决不了思想问题。（五分政、林华）
