　　Du Balian Strictly Guards River Defenses, Helps New District Avenge Land Reform

　　[Our newspaper's Ji'nan dispatch] The Du Balian militia strictly guards river defenses, carries out riverside explosions, maintains strict sentry duty, and intensifies suppression of bandits, protecting land reform in newly recovered areas, achieving a three-in-one combination of combat, training, and land reform. Since the Du Balian militia went to the river crossings at Potou, Nanchen, and other places to carry out river defense struggles, they repelled three attempted crossings by the stubborn bandits Wei Ansheng and Wang Youcong's forces on September 24th, 26th, and 27th, wounding 22 enemies in explosions, and crossed the Yellow River to raid Xitan, driving away the enemy. Now the riverside sentry posts are very strict, and enemy spies and traitors have no opportunity to enter. We are constantly searching and suppressing bandits, conducting household registration in a focused, planned, and flexible manner, so that the bad elements have nowhere to hide, and the newly recovered masses can boldly speak out about their suffering, seek revenge, and carry out land reform. On September 27th, they convened more than 1,200 poor peasants and hired laborers from newly recovered villages such as Potou at Madong Village to mourn the masses who were brutally killed by bandit troops, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, and traitorous landlords. The majority of the masses cried bitterly, inspiring everyone's fighting spirit. After the meeting, the masses in Potou have begun to mobilize. Each company has organized two land reform propaganda and investigation teams, simultaneously fighting and conducting land reform propaganda and investigation, and directly participating in mass struggle meetings, working with the masses to complete the historical task of land reform. While engaged in tense and busy river defense and land reform, the Du Balian militia also seize gaps to engage in intensive training in three major skills (grenade throwing, aiming, and explosives, with explosives as the main focus), and strengthen political study, reading newspapers, and examining class and ideology.
