Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Comprehensive news on the Indonesian-Dutch war situation over the past two and a half months shows that the Indonesian army is getting stronger, and the Dutch army's strategic plan has suffered a preliminary setback; Dutch Prime Minister Beel's hope to "resolve the issue within two months" has become a bubble. So far, the Indonesian-Dutch war can be divided into three stages: July 20th to the end of July is the first stage. At that time, the Dutch army, with its 100,000 "elite" troops trained by the US and UK, launched a general offensive against the Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta, from Batavia, Surabaya, and Semarang in three routes, with the cooperation of aircraft and artillery supplied by the US, UK, and Canada. Because the Dutch army carried out a sneak attack, it was able to seize more than 20 military strongholds and important ports, such as Malang, relatively smoothly at the beginning of the war, forming a large encirclement of Yogyakarta. On July 23, the Dutch army once advanced to 20 miles from Yogyakarta. After the Indonesian government issued an emergency mobilization order on July 21 and insisted on a protracted war, it immediately launched a tenacious and resolute blocking war to defend Greater Yogyakarta and defend the motherland. Yogyakarta was relieved on July 25. The Indonesian army launched a counterattack on all fronts simultaneously, and on the 24th, it recovered the Malang Air Station and nearly ten other important bases of various sizes. The second stage is from the beginning of August to the beginning of September. The Dutch army ignored the Security Council's ceasefire order of August 1 and organized a second large-scale offensive against Yogyakarta, and landed in Madura, making the war increasingly urgent. The Indonesian government ordered the entire army to attack the Dutch invading army and launched a widespread guerrilla war, calling on the Indonesian people in the Dutch-occupied areas to engage in strikes and sabotage. According to the Indonesian military communique, in the month from August 5, when the Dutch army violated the ceasefire order and occupied Gamping, to September 6, a total of 994 offensives were launched. On August 28, the Dutch army advanced to 50 miles from Yogyakarta again. Its main offensive was defeated in Ambarawa and then withdrew immediately. On September 3, the Indonesian army once again liberated the Malang airbase, which had fallen into enemy hands on August 21. The Indonesian army took advantage of the victory to advance towards the Dutch army's rear, which was short of troops (such as Batavia, Surabaya, etc.). At this time, the Dutch army's offensive was weaker than before. The third stage is from mid-September to the present. The Indonesian army has temporarily eliminated the threat of the Dutch army's attack on Yogyakarta, stopping the enemy's offensive spearheads in the Malang area (East Java), the area north of Ambarawa (Central Java), and the Bandung area and near Cilacap (Southwest Java). The Indonesian army has turned to launch an offensive against strategic strongholds. In addition, due to the great activity of Indonesian snipers and the vigorous development of strikes and sabotage, the Dutch army was forced to transfer considerable troops to carry out "sweeping," and retreated to its occupied areas. As the Batavia Telegraph Office stated on September 12: "Dutch commando forces have withdrawn from all fronts and are temporarily used to strengthen the cleanup work in their occupied areas." The Dutch army's expansion offensive on Sumatra and Madura Island has made no major progress so far. At present, the Dutch army is still continuing to reinforce, and its ambition to seize Yogyakarta has not died. In the increasingly fierce and cruel battles in the future, the Indonesian army will more effectively strike the enemy. The Dutch army's two strong attacks on Yogyakarta failed, exposing the following basic weaknesses of the Dutch army: (1) Insufficient troops, (2) Difficulty in reinforcements and supplies, (3) Low morale, (4) Declining combat effectiveness. At the same time, it shows that, under the leadership of the Indonesian government and with the support of 70 million Indonesian people, the strength of the Indonesian army is growing, and the Indonesian army's regular troops have increased from 140,000 to 200,000, and its combat effectiveness has also been greatly improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. News from various sources: After two days of debate, the Security Council passed a resolution on the 3rd with nine votes to zero, establishing a three-nation committee composed of the United States, Australia, and Belgium to mediate the Indonesian-Dutch dispute. The Soviet Union and Poland abstained. It is reported that the negotiations hosted by the three-nation committee will be held in Singapore. The Indonesian cabinet met on the 1st and agreed to negotiate. The Indonesian representatives attending the negotiations will include Prime Minister Sjahrir and Indonesian representatives abroad, such as Sjahrir. The Indonesian side's attitude towards this negotiation is very clear. Spokespersons for the Islamic Party, the Nationalist Party, the Farmers' Party, and the Indonesian Trade Union Central said on the 4th that the Linggadjati Agreement can no longer be used as the basis for renewed Indonesian-Dutch negotiations. Legal recognition of the Republic of Indonesia must be one of the conditions for negotiations with the Netherlands. The Indonesian Prime Minister stated in his speech at the political affairs meeting on the 4th that the Dutch army must withdraw from all Indonesian islands. The Republic of Indonesia has been recognized by many countries, but the Dutch army is conspiring to destroy Indonesia's peace and security. In order to defend the Republic of Indonesia, President Sukarno, at the 2nd anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian army on October 5th, called on the Indonesian military and civilians to continue to eliminate the invading enemy and fight against Dutch imperialism and its war of enslavement!

### 印尼军民两个月来越战越强　荷军战略计划受挫  苏加诺号召继续消灭进犯军

　　印尼军民两个月来越战越强
  　荷军战略计划受挫
    苏加诺号召继续消灭进犯军
    【新华社陕北四日电】综合两个半月来印荷战况消息，显示印尼军越战越强，荷军战略计划已遭受初步挫败；荷内阁总理比尔扬言于“两个月内解决问题”之希望，已成泡影。迄今为止，印荷战事可分为三个时期：七月二十日至七月底为第一个时期。当时荷军携十万美英训练之“精锐”部队，在美英加供给的飞机大炮配合下，从巴城、泗水、三宝珑分三路向印尼首都日惹发动总攻击战，因荷军施行偷袭，故在战争开头，能比较顺利地强占玛琅等二十余处军事要地及重要港口，形成对日惹的大包围。七月二十三日荷军一度推进至日惹二十英里处，印尼政府于七月二十一日颁布紧急总动员令并坚持持久抗战后，立即展开保卫大日惹，保卫祖国的顽强而坚决的阻击战，日惹于七月二十五日即告解围。印尼军在各线同时进行反击战，二十四日收复玛琅航空站及其他大小近十处重要基地。第二个时期系八月初至九月初旬。荷军不顾安理会八月一日之停战令，第二次组织侵犯日惹的大攻势，并在马都拉登陆，因而使战事越形紧急，印尼政府下令全军打击荷兰进犯军，同时展开广泛的游击战；并号召荷占领区的印尼人民进行怠工与破坏运动。据印尼军公报称：从八月五日荷军破坏停战令攻占甘望起，至九月六日止的一个月中间，共发动了九九四次攻势，八月二十八日荷军又推进至距日惹五十英里处，其主攻锋芒于安巴拉哇被击溃后，遂即撤离。九月三日，印尼军再度解放曾于八月二十一日陷入敌手之玛琅航空基地。印尼军乘胜向兵力空虚之荷军后方（如巴城、泗水等区）推进。此时期荷军攻势已较前软弱。第三个时期系九月中旬迄今，印尼军已暂时消除了荷军进攻日惹之威胁，把敌人攻势箭头制止在玛琅区（东部爪哇），安巴拉哇以北地区（中部爪哇）及万隆区与芝拉扎附近（西南爪哇）。印尼军转而发动对战略要地之攻坚战，加上因印尼狙击兵大为活跃及怠工破坏运动之蓬勃开展，荷军被迫抽调相当兵力进行“扫荡”，并退守其占领区。如九月十二日巴城电讯所称：“荷突击部队已自各线撤退，暂用于加强其占领区内之清除工作。”在苏岛及马都拉岛荷军之扩张攻势至今无大进展。目前荷军仍在继续增援，其攫取日惹之野心未死，印尼军在今后愈形激烈和残酷的战斗中，必将更有效地打击敌人。荷军二次强攻日惹均未得逞，暴露了荷军如下基本弱点：（一）兵力不足，（二）增援与给养困难，（三）士气低落，（四）战斗力衰退。同时却说明了，在印尼政府领导及七千万印尼人民拥护下，印尼军力量在生长中，印尼军正规部队已由十四万增至二十万人，战斗力亦大为提高。
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方讯：安理会经两天辩论后，已于三日以九票对零票通过由美澳比组成三国委员会调停印荷纠纷。联苏与波兰弃权。据悉，由三国委员会主持之谈判，将在新加坡举行，印尼内阁于一日集会同意谈判，出席谈判之印尼代表将包括内阁总理沙利佛丁及印尼共和国驻国外代表沙利尔等官员。印尼方面对这次谈判的态度非常明确。回教党、国民党、农民党及印尼工会中央发言人于四日称：林加耶蒂协定已不能作为印荷重新谈判之基础。法律上必须承认印尼共和国，将是与荷兰谈判的条件之一。印尼内阁总理四日在政务会上的发言，力称荷军必须自印尼各岛撤退。印尼共和国已为许多国家所承认，但荷军则阴谋破灭印尼之和平与安全。为了保卫印尼共和国，苏加诺总统于十月五日印尼建军二周年大会上，号召印尼军民继续消灭进犯的敌人，为反抗荷兰帝国主义及其奴役战争而斗争！
