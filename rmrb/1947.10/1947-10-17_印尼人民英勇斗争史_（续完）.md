　　The Heroic Struggle History of the Indonesian People
  　(Conclusion)
    Zhang Shangming
    These three organizations spread active revolutionary factors within the "Islamic Union" and the "Education Promotion Association." The leader of the Semarang "Islamic Union" branch, Smaun, was actually a sympathizer and supporter of the socialist movement at the time.

    Under the influence of the Russian overthrow of the Tsar, especially the victory of the October Revolution, the Indonesian revolutionary movement surged even higher. Feeling threatened by this trend, the Dutch rulers had to adopt a "New Policy" to缓和the struggle of the Indonesian people. In 1916, the Dutch ruling authorities established a "National Council" in Java and also made slight concessions to the Indonesian national bourgeoisie in terms of economy. However, they still adopted brutal suppression against the Indonesian people's resistance struggle. In 1916, the Indonesian government sent a large number of troops to hunt down and kill farmers in Jambi (Sumatra) who resisted taxation.

    Up until World War I, although Indonesian parties had advanced the Indonesian revolutionary movement, they still lacked a clear independent political program, and internal political views were very divided, which became a common weakness of all parties.

    The establishment of the Dutch "National Council" clarified the division between the "left" and "right" lines within Indonesian parties. Some leaders of the "Education Promotion Association" and the "Islamic Union," along with opportunists in the Indonesian Social Democratic Party, tended to embrace the rulers. The revolutionary Social Democratic Party, represented by Sneevliet, and the left wing of the "Islamic Union," represented by Smaun (both of whom later became founders of the Indonesian Communist Party), successively broke away from their parties after opposing compromise, that is, opposing participation in the "National Council." This was the beginning of the internal struggle that marked the division within the main Indonesian parties on the eve of the Indonesian Communist Party's emergence.

    The Founding of the Indonesian Communist Party and the Great Revolution of 1926

    The Indonesian Communist Party was founded in 1920, and for the first time put forward the revolutionary tasks of "Indonesian independence, land to the tiller, and an eight-hour work system" in its own political program; the Indonesian revolutionary movement thus began a new chapter.

    In 1923, the Java railway workers' general strike, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, achieved victory. Workers restored their 1921 wage levels, released arrested comrades, and the Dutch recognized the eight-hour work system. This major event indicated that the young Indonesian Communist Party had a foundation of political influence among the working masses. At the same time, the "Islamic Union," due to its moderate reformist line, greatly reduced its prestige, and many members left the "Islamic Union." These comrades consistently adhered to the leadership of the Communist Party and established the "People's Union." The ranks of the Indonesian Communist Party expanded unprecedentedly. At this time, the Indonesian Communist Party had 10,000 members, 100,000 organized masses, published three official newspapers and periodicals, ran party schools, and open Indonesian Communist Party members were active in cities and villages. In the years of revolutionary upsurge, the Dutch authorities even had to issue "invitations" to the Indonesian Communist Party, inviting Communist Party members to participate in the parliament, but the Indonesian Communist Party rejected this "invitation."

    The Indonesian Communist Party also worked to establish an anti-imperialist united front, but the joint meeting of various parties held in Surabaya in 1924 ultimately failed because the parties insisted on their different political and religious beliefs.

    The growing strength of the Indonesian people's revolutionary forces made the Dutch rulers increasingly uneasy. Therefore, in 1925, the Dutch East Indies government promulgated a reactionary decree, abolishing freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association. But this measure could no longer prevent the Indonesian people from overthrowing Dutch rule, and it became the fuse for the first great revolution in Indonesia directly led by the Indonesian Communist Party. In November 1926, West Java first sounded the guns of the uprising, and soon all of Java and Sumatra responded together. The uprising masses occupied telegraph bureaus and other important government buildings. The Dutch government mobilized a great force and spent three or four months to suppress this revolution. The Indonesian Communist Party, the "People's Union," and revolutionary trade unions were destroyed. 15,000 revolutionaries were slaughtered or imprisoned, including 5,000 (the current chairman of the Indonesian Communist Party, Satiadjono, was exiled at this time) who were exiled to the malaria-ridden areas of New Guinea. At this point, the Indonesian Communist Party was forced to go underground.

    During the Great Revolution, the reactionary leader of the Social Democratic Party, Stokvis, and the right wing of the "Islamic Union," Ajunodo, completely colluded with the Dutch East Indies rulers and became accomplices in opposing the Indonesian independence movement. It was precisely because of this that the opposition within the "Islamic Union" successively left the party, and the "Islamic Union" therefore turned from being supported by the people to being opposed by the people.

    The Economic Panic Period

    The Dutch rulers were terrified by the revolutionary storm of 1926; they basically determined to continue suppressing the Indonesian people's independence movement. This barbaric policy was fully exposed during the period of economic panic, and even the activities of nationalists were not allowed to exist. In 1927, Sukarno (the current president of the Republic of Indonesia) inherited and used the slogans of the Indonesian Communist Party to organize the "Indonesian Nationalist Party," which was dissolved in 1929, and Sukarno was arrested and imprisoned. Sukarno and Hatta jointly reorganized the "Indonesian Party" in 1931, but this organization suffered the same fate in less than a year. Sukarno, Hatta, and other nationalist leaders were expelled and exiled. However, the Indonesian people's resistance struggle was not suppressed, but continued to develop with ups and downs. In 1933, Indonesian sailors led by Imbich from the Dutch East Indies armored cruiser "Seven Provinces" launched an uprising against wage cuts. The Dutch rulers on board were very panicked, and the revolutionaries sailed the warship away. The Dutch government sent aircraft to bomb the ship, and 23 insurgents died heroically, while the rest who were arrested were subjected to the death penalty. This uprising was clearly closely related to the Indonesian Communist Party's movement against widespread Dutch wage cuts, tax increases, and layoffs. During this period, overseas Chinese communist elements in Indonesia also became active. Their official publication, "Red Tide," publicized opposition to the Dutch reactionary policies of oppressing the Indonesian people and gave enthusiastic support to the Indonesian people's independence and liberation movement. Many Indonesian overseas Chinese Communist Party members were exposed by the Dutch government for participating in actual struggles and were either thrown into prison or expelled from the country.

    Parliamentary Struggle to the Pacific War Period

    The Dutch rulers even strictly restricted the legal parliamentary struggle that began to rise in 1935. In early 1939, the Dutch government and parliament rejected the proposal of Indonesian members of the Java "National Council" regarding "the establishment of a joint meeting composed of Dutch and Indonesians to realize the Indonesian autonomy stipulated in the constitution" (the proposal was passed by the Java "National Council" in 1936). This failure aroused dissatisfaction among some Indonesian parliamentarians. Progressives within many political parties, led by Sjahrir (the former Prime Minister of the Republic of Indonesia, currently the Indonesian government's representative to the Security Council), launched the "United Struggle Movement" in order to strengthen the power of the legal parliamentary struggle. Therefore, in the summer of 1939, an alliance of seven Indonesian political parties was established; the participating parties included the "East Indies Islamic Party," the "Indonesian National Movement Party," the "Indonesian Christian Party," the "Minahasa Party," the "Parindra Party," and the "Gerindo Party." However, the main leaders of these political parties adopted a moderate attitude towards the Dutch authorities, and some were even pro-Dutch, thus complicating the legal parliamentary struggle. After the outbreak of the Second European War and the fall of the Netherlands, some organizations, under the control of compromisers, became tools of the Dutch, and a small number of upper-level leaders were bought by the Dutch government.

    After the fall of the Netherlands, the mass revolutionary struggle against the Dutch and anti-imperialist war lurking in Java was increasing. The pro-Dutch party leader Starz warned the government in parliament: "...Dissatisfaction with Dutch policy exists not only among intellectuals, but also the same antipathy exists in the hearts of the entire nation,... Those who believe that the Indonesian people do not care about the fate of the country are purely superficial views..." Danling, the party leader of the pro-Dutch "Parindra Party," more bluntly said: "In the event of a war breaking out in the Dutch East Indies,... there is no basis to prove that the Indonesian people will express loyalty to the Dutch East Indies government..." In June 1940, the Dutch East Indies Army Department declared martial law. In order to reduce the chances of continuous explosions in gunpowder depots, a large number of heads of anti-Dutch movements ("Indian Party") were arrested (including the current Prime Minister of Indonesia, Sjahrir, who was arrested at this time). Progressive publications and newspapers were closed, and the bloody destruction of Indonesian democratic parties and organizations began, stepping up the prevention of the Indonesian people's independence movement. This high-pressure policy remained unchanged after the outbreak of the Pacific War, thus causing the vast fertile land of Indonesia to completely fall into the hands of the Japanese寇in just two and a half months.

    In the face of the Japanese寇invasion, Dutch imperialism shamelessly fled at the first sign of trouble, while the Indonesian people heroically held high the banner of resistance against Japan, launched guerrilla warfare, were active in Java and the outer islands, and effectively sabotaged enemy transportation lines. The oil fields in Borneo and Sumatra were destroyed several times. The Indonesian people gave the same cold shoulder and contempt to the Dutch imperialist promise of December 6, 1942: "Allowing Indonesia to join the Dutch Federation" and Tojo's deception of allowing the Indonesian people to "participate in politics" in 1943. During the three years of the anti-Japanese movement, the Indonesian people prepared the necessary conditions for their own independence and liberation.

    Struggle to Defend the Republic After the Japanese寇Surrender

    After the Japanese寇surrendered, the Indonesian people first overcame the stubborn resistance of the Japanese寇under the instructions of the British and Dutch, and finally established their own regime on August 17, 1945 – the Republic of Indonesia. The 350 years of heinous enslavement and rule by Dutch imperialism thus came to an end. "The government of the Republic of Indonesia is a democratic government, it accommodates all classes and parties in Indonesia, and unites all progressive forces of the people" (Manifesto of the Indonesian Communist Party). In the past two years, the Republic of Indonesia has continuously expanded its democratic foundation in all aspects, for example: the reorganization of the "National Committee" at the end of 1946, the Indonesian Communist Party increased from one seat to thirty-five seats. In addition, Indonesia has also carried out land reform, implemented universal education, and people's lives have improved. In March of this year, the Indonesian Socialist Party, Communist Party, Labor Party, and other democratic parties and organizations held a joint meeting and passed a program of joint action against the Dutch, with resolutions including: nationalization of industry, the establishment of a modern army, etc. Recently, the French Consul General, Lian Te, who went to the Indonesian liberated areas with the six-nation consular corps for preliminary "inspection," also had to admit that "the cities and villages in the Indonesian liberated areas are very quiet and orderly." Although Dutch war vendors, directly supported by the imperialists of the United States and Britain, are still attempting to snatch chestnuts from the fire, attempting to reimpose colonial oppression on the Indonesian people. However, all the people of Indonesia, regardless of men, women, old, and young, have been mobilized, enthusiastically joining the army and participating in the war, supporting the government's policy of resisting the war to the end, and vowing to fight to the death to defend the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian people are destined to defeat Dutch imperialism in the end.

　　印尼人民英勇斗争史
  　（续完）
    张上明
    这三个组织在“回教同盟”，“教育促进会”当中散布了积极的革命因素，三宝珑“回教同盟”支部的领导人史马温，当时实际上已是社会主义运动的同情者与支持者。
    在俄国推翻沙皇、尤其是十月革命胜利的影响下，印尼革命运动更形高涨，感到这种趋势威胁的荷兰统治者，不得不采取“新政”，来缓和印尼人民的斗争。荷兰统治当局一九一六年在爪哇成立了“国民议会”，经济上对印尼民族资产阶级也作了些微的让步。然而，他们对于印尼人民的反抗斗争，仍然采取残暴的镇压，一九一六年印尼政府曾派大批兵马捕杀占碑（苏门答腊）抗税的农民。
    到第一次世界大战为止，印尼各党派虽曾将印尼的革命运动向前推进，但是，还缺乏明确的独立政纲，内部政见又很分歧，却成为各党派共同的弱点。
    荷兰“国民议会”之设立，使印尼各党派内部“左”、右两条路线的分野明朗化，一部分“教育促进会”、“回教同盟”的领导人物，连同印尼社会民主党中的机会主义分子有投到统治者怀抱之趋向。革命的社会民主党以史聂费立脱为代表、“回教同盟”左派以史马温为代表。（两者后来都成为印尼共产党的创始人），在反对妥协、即反对参加“国民议会”之后，相继脱党。这是印尼共产党产生前夜印尼主要党派内部分裂之开始的内部斗争。
    印尼共产党的成立与一九二六年大革命
    印尼共产党于一九二○年成立，在自己的政纲中第一次提出“印尼独立、耕者有其田、八小时工作制”的革命任务；印尼的革命运动从此开始了崭新的一页。
    一九二三年爪哇铁路工人大罢工，在印尼共产党领导下取得了胜利，工人恢复一九二一年的工资水准，释放了被捕工友，荷兰承认八小时工作制。这一大事件表示了年青的印尼共产党在劳苦群众中的政治影响有了基础。同时，“回教同盟”因其温和的改良主义路线，使它大大的降低了自己的威信，许多会员离开了“回教同盟”。这些同志始终不渝坚持了共产党的领导，成立了“人民同盟”。印尼共产党的队伍空前的扩大了，这时候，印尼共产党拥有一万名党员，十万有组织的群众，出版三种机关刊物报纸，开办党校，城市和乡村中有公开的印尼共产党员在活动。在革命高涨年份，荷兰当局甚至不得不向印尼共产党发出了“请帖”，邀请共产党员参加议会，但是，印尼共产党拒绝了这个“聘请”。
    印尼共产党也曾经为建立反帝统一战线而努力，但是，一九二四年在泗水召开的各党派联席会议，终于因为各党派坚持政治、信仰的不同而归于失败。
    印尼人民革命力量的日益成长，使荷兰统治者日益不安，于是，一九二五年荷印政府颁布了反动的法令，取消言论、出版、集会、结社的自由。但是这一措施已经不能阻止印尼人民推翻荷兰统治，它成为印尼共产党直接领导的印尼第一次大革命的导火线。一九二六年十一月西爪哇首先响起了起义的炮声，马上全爪哇和苏门答腊都一齐响应。起义的群众占领电报局及其他重要政府建筑物，荷兰政府动员了很大的力量，费时三四个月才把这次革命镇压下去。印尼共产党、“人民同盟”和革命工会被破坏，一万五千名革命者被屠杀或监禁起来，其中有五千人（现在的印尼共产党主席沙特约诺即于此时被逐）被流放至新几尼亚的瘴气猖獗地区。至此，印尼共产党被迫进行地下活动。
    大革命时期，社会民主党反动领袖史多格费斯、以及“回教同盟”右派阿朱诺多完全与荷印统治者勾结在一起，成为反对印尼独立运动之帮凶，也正因为如此，“回教同盟”党内的反对派相继脱党，“回教同盟”遂因此由众人拥护变成众人反对的之境。
    经济恐慌时期
    荷兰统治者被一九二六年革命风暴所惊骇；基本上就此确定了继续扑灭印尼人民独立运动的方针。这种野蛮的政策，到了经济恐慌时期便完全暴露出来，甚至连民族主义者之活动都不容存在。一九二七年苏加诺（即印尼共和国现任总统）继承与利用印尼共产党的口号起而组织“印尼国民党”，一九二九年被解散，苏氏被捕入狱。苏加诺与哈达一九三一年联合重新组织“印度尼西亚党”，此组织产生不及一年也遭到同样的命运。苏、哈及其他民族主义领袖受到驱逐、流放的处分。但是，印尼人民的反抗斗争，却并未被镇压下去，相反的，以起伏不停之势继续发展。一九三三年荷印装甲巡洋舰“七省号”之印尼水兵任比香发动反对减薪的起义，舰上荷兰统治者非常惊慌，革命者把军舰驶跑。荷兰政府派遣飞机轰炸，二十三名起义者光荣牺牲，其余被逮捕的都处以极刑。这次起义显然是与印尼共产党反对荷兰普遍减薪、增税、裁员运动息息相关的。这一时期，印尼境内的华侨共产主义分子，一时也活跃起来，他们的机关刊物——红潮，宣传反对荷兰压迫印尼人民的反动政策，对印尼人民的独立解放运动给以热烈的支持。有许多印尼华侨共产党员因参加实际斗争，被荷兰政府检举出来之后，或者被投入监牢里，或者就被驱逐出境。
    议会斗争到太平洋战争时期
    荷兰统治者甚至对一九三五年开始抬头的合法议会斗争，都给以严格的限制。一九三九年初，荷兰政府与国会否决了爪哇“国民议会”印尼议员关于“设立由荷兰、印尼人联合组成的联席会议，以实现宪法规定之印尼自治”的提案（该提案于一九三六年爪哇“国民议会”通过）。这次失败引起了一部分印尼议员的不满，有许多政党内部的进步分子，当时是以沙利尔（即印尼共和国前内阁总理，现任印尼政府出席安理会代表）等为首，发起了“统一斗争运动”，以便加强议会合法斗争的力量。因此，便于一九三九年夏成立了印尼七个政党之联盟；参加政党有“东印度回教党”，“印尼国民运动党”，“印尼基督教党”，“明娜哈沙党”，“巴林德拉党”及“格印度党”等。但是，这些政党的主要领导人物，对荷兰当局采取温和的态度，有些还是亲荷派，因而，使合法的议会斗争更加复杂化。到了第二次欧战爆发、荷兰沦亡不久，有些组织在妥协派控制下成为荷兰的御用工具，少数上层领导人物被荷兰政府所收买。
    荷兰沦陷之后，爪哇潜伏着的反荷、反帝国主义战争的群众革命斗争在增涨着，亲荷派政党领袖史打尔佐在议会上警告政府：“……对荷兰政策的不满，不仅仅在知识分子中间存在着，而且，在全体国民心里都有同样的反感，……那些认为印度尼西亚人民不关心国家命运之观点，纯系皮毛的看法。……”亲荷色彩浓厚的“巴林德拉党”党魁丹林更露骨的说：“万一荷印爆发战争，……没有任何根据足以证明印度尼西亚人会对荷印政府表示忠诚……”。一九四○年六月，荷印陆军部宣布戒严令，为了减少火药库爆炸案连续发生的机会，逮捕了大批反荷运动的“嫌疑分子”（“印度党”）的首脑戴格尔、沙利佛丁：即印尼现内阁总理等即在此时被捕），封闭进步刊物和报纸，并开始血腥摧残印尼民主党派团体的组织，加紧防止印尼人民的独立运动。这种高压政策，到太平洋战争爆发后始终没有改变，因而使印度尼西亚的辽阔沃土在两个半月内便完全沦陷于日寇之手。
    在日寇侵略面前，荷兰帝国主义无耻的望风而逃，印尼人民却英勇的高举抗日旗帜，发动游击战，活跃于爪哇及外岛，有效的破坏敌人交通线，婆罗洲、苏门答腊的油田曾受到数次破坏。印尼人民把一九四二年十二月六日荷兰帝国主义的诺言：“允许印尼加入荷兰联邦”和一九四三年东条允许印尼人民“参政”的欺骗，同样的冷视和唾弃，在三年抗日运动期间，印尼人民为自身的独立解放准备了必要的条件。
    日寇投降后为保卫共和国而斗争
    日寇投降，印尼人民首先克服了英荷指令下的日寇顽强抗拒后，终于一九四五年八月十七日建立自己的政权——印尼共和国。荷兰帝国主义三百五十年来万恶的奴役统治就此结束。“印尼共和国政府是个民主的政府，它容纳印尼各阶级各党派，并团结了人民的一切进步势力”（印尼共产党宣言）。两年来印尼共和国在各个方面不断地扩大了自己的民主基础，例如：一九四六年年底“民族委员会”的改组，印尼共产党由一席增加到卅五席。此外，印尼并进行了土地改革，施行普遍教育，人民生活获得改善。今年三月间印尼社会党、共产党、劳工党，及其他民主党派团体举行联席会议，通过了反荷共同行动的纲领，议决中有：工业国有化，建立现代化的军队等等。最近随六国领事团赴印尼解放区作初步“视察”之法国总领事廉特，亦不得不承认“印尼解放区的城市与乡村都十分安静与秩序井然”。虽然，在美英两国帝国主义直接撑腰下的荷兰战争贩子，仍在作火中取粟之尝试，妄图把殖民地压迫重加在印尼人民身上。但是，全印度尼西亚人民不分男女老少，已经动员起来，热烈地参军参战，拥护政府抗战到底的方针，并誓死为保卫印尼共和国而斗争。印尼人民注定了荷兰帝国主义最后必败。
