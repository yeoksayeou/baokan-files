　　Panic in Hankou
　　Shang Yin

　　After the People's Liberation Army entered the Dabie Mountains, they reached the banks of the Yangtze River in less than a week. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Hankou had just been terrified by the "bad news" of the annihilation of the 66th Division in southwestern Shandong (the 66th Division was originally the guard unit of Wuhan, and the families of the division were all in Wuhan). Unexpectedly, only a month later, the People's Liberation Army arrived right in front of them.

　　The Chiang Kai-shek military and political circles believed that their situation was a "do-or-die battle" with three sides facing "enemies" and one side facing the river. Therefore, they quickly put the city's land and water transportation under control. Each high-ranking official, in addition to a car, had to prepare a wooden boat and a mooring pier in preparation for their escape.

　　After the transportation was controlled, the freight costs were particularly considerable. It cost 11 million yuan to cross the river with one ton of materials; the Beijing-Hankou transportation was paralyzed for two months. After dark, all activities were stopped under the order of "martial law"; the river surface was deserted, leaving only a vast expanse of white water. The merchants of Hankou had completely lost confidence in the Chiang Kai-shek court. On the Mid-Autumn Festival, more than 80 firms in the city launched a run on the Hankou branch of the Central Bank, so that the bank cashed out all the gold and shipped 6 billion yuan in cash from the Hengyang branch by boat, but still could not pay. This storm attacked the entire Wuhan business community like a storm. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities forbade closing down, and at the same time advised all businesses to be ready to move south at any time. But the merchants said: There is no need to prepare anything, just buy a package of firecrackers to welcome the People's Liberation Army into the city.

　　On both sides of the Beijing-Hankou Yangtze River, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were deeply afraid of the People's Liberation Army crossing the river. In addition to forcibly forming the so-called "river defense reserve team" within a time limit, they dispatched gunboats to patrol during the day in Wuhu, Anqing, Hukou, Stone Bell Mountain, Dagu Mountain, Huangzhou and other places, and at night they sent planes to patrol with flares. The Chiang Kai-shek's navy, army and air force were all put to use. However, in this state of panic, the turbulent hearts became even more uneasy. As long as there was any movement in Jiangbei, it would quickly spread to Jiangnan. And these news were always so "horrifying." When the People's Liberation Army arrived in Zhejiang and Tongcheng last month, Nanjing was rumored that Anqing had already "fallen," and it was said that refugees who had escaped from Anqing had appeared in a certain hotel. This news quickly spread to Wuhan, making the floating hearts even more panicked... (Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan, 26th)

　　恐慌的汉口
    尚吟
    人民解放军进入大别山后，不到一个星期就到达长江岸边，汉口的蒋家匪帮们，刚被六六师在鲁西南覆灭的“恶耗”吓得惊魂未定（六六师原为武汉的警卫部队，该师的后方家属均在武汉），不料才一个月，解放军又来到面前了。
    蒋匪军政界以为自己的处境已是三面临“敌”、一面临江的“背水之战”了，所以迅速将全市的水陆交通管制起来。每个大员除一辆汽车之外，还须准备一个木划子和一个停泊的码头，以为其逃跑作准备。
    交通工具被管制后，运费尤其可观，一吨物资过一次江索资一千一百万元；京汉的交通两个月来即告瘫痪。天黑以后，一切活动都在“戒严”的命令下被停止了；江面上是冷清清的，只留下一片茫茫的白水。汉口的商人们对蒋家朝廷已完全失去信心，中秋节那天，全市八十余家行庄，向中央银行驻汉分行闹了一次提款风潮，以致该行兑出全部黄金和用轮船从衡阳分行运来六十亿元现款，都无法支付。这场风潮象风暴一样袭击着整个武汉的商场。蒋匪当局不准关门歇业，同时又劝告各商号随时准备南迁。但商人们表示：什么也无须准备，只须买下一包爆竹，准备欢迎解放军进城就够了。
    在京汉沿江两岸，蒋匪深怕解放军过江，除限期强迫编成所谓“江防守备队”外，在芜湖、安庆、湖口、石钟山、大姑山、黄州等地，白天派遣炮舰巡逻，晚上又加派飞机以照明弹巡视，蒋匪的海陆空军都算是用上了。但这种慌乱的状态下，动荡的人心反而愈加显得不安。只要江北一有什么动静，江南就很快的传开了。而且这些消息总是那样“骇人听闻”。前月解放军到达浙江、桐城一带时，南京即盛传安庆已经“失守，”并且传说在某旅馆出现自安庆逃出的难民。这消息很快就传到武汉，使浮动的人心更加恐慌……。（新华社鄂豫皖二十六日电）
