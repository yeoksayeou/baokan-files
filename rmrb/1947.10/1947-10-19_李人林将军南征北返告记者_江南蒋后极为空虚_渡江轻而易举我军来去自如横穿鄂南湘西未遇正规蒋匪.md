　　General Li Renlin Returns North After Southern Expedition, Tells Reporter
　　Jiangnan Chiang Rear is Extremely Empty
　　Crossing the Yangtze is Easy, Our Army Comes and Goes Freely, Crossing Southern Hubei and Western Hunan Without Encountering Regular Chiang Bandits
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, 17th] Frontline reporter Wang Kuang reports: General Li Renlin, who has persisted in guerrilla warfare behind Chiang and whose prestige shakes both sides of the Yangtze River, recently spoke to reporters about his experiences behind Chiang. General Li first stated, "What impressed me most during this southern expedition and return north was the extreme emptiness of Jiangnan, which is the rear of the Chiang bandits. Our unit crossed the river in January, passing through more than ten counties in southern Hubei and western Hunan, including Gong'an, Li County, Shimen, Wufeng, Changyang, Cili, Dayong, Sangzhi, Baojing, Hefeng, and Xuan'en, a journey of over a thousand li, without encountering resistance from a single regular soldier of the Chiang bandits. We went wherever we wanted, swaggering about. It wasn't until April of this year that the Chiang bandits finally exhausted their efforts, scraping together the 52nd Division, 33rd Brigade, and several regiments from Pan Wenhua in Sichuan. In reality, these were just newly replenished, old, weak, and disabled soldiers, whose combat strength was hardly stronger than the county police. In the Dayan @ battle in Feng County on our way back, we wiped out an entire battalion with one blow. Since then, the Chiang bandit army has been afraid to get close to us." General Li continued, "When we crossed the river, we crossed south from Hao Xue in Jiangling. This is an important town on the Yangtze River, but there were no regular soldiers guarding it. The only security detachment and town government were completely dealt with by us. When we returned north after completing our predetermined mission in Jiangnan, we crossed the river from Zhijiang County. There, only the remaining armed forces of the county government resisted our army. After our army annihilated them, we safely crossed north. From this, you can see how empty the Chiang bandit's rear is." When the reporter inquired about the Chiang bandit's defenses along the Yangtze River, General Li said humorously, "This is called defense that cannot be defended; may I ask, from Shanghai to Badong, there are so many ferry crossings along the thousands of li of the riverbank, and boats are so convenient, how can they be defended? What can they use to defend it? If we compare crossing the Yangtze River with crossing the 'natural barrier' Yellow River, crossing the Yangtze is obviously an easy task. Our freedom to come and go over the past year is clear evidence of this. As for the recent boasting by the Chiang bandits in the Beijing-Hankou area about 'consolidated river defenses,' this is just a self-deceiving talk, and also shows their emptiness and fear." Finally, General Li recounted the Jiangnan people's fervent hope for the Liberation Army, saying, "The people of Jiangnan have great hope and love for the Liberation Army. This is not only because they have a revolutionary historical tradition, and our army's strict discipline and opening granaries to relieve the poor have left a good impression on the common people, but more importantly, we have destroyed the Chiang family's local security regime, which sucks the people's fat, so they no longer have to provide conscripts and grain for the four major families. Many strong young men who had been 'pre-conscripted' into the army came to us upon hearing of the arrival of our army, requesting protection. Some farmers even sent people to ask our army to station near them."

　　李人林将军南征北返告记者
  　江南蒋后极为空虚
    渡江轻而易举我军来去自如横穿鄂南湘西未遇正规蒋匪
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十七日电】前线记者王匡报导：坚持蒋后游击战争威震大江南北之李人林将军，顷对记者畅谈蒋后见闻。李将军首称：“此次南征北返，印象较深的是作为蒋匪后方的江南，异常空虚。我部是一月间过江的，路经鄂南湘西之公安、礼县、石门、五峰、长阳、慈利、大庸、桑植、保靖、鹤峰、宣恩等十余县，行程千余里未曾遇到蒋匪的一个正规兵丁的抵抗，我们大摇大摆地要到那里就到那里。一直等到今年四月间，蒋贼才费尽气力，东凑西拼的调来了五十二师卅三旅，和四川潘文华的几个团。其实这些不过是新补充的老弱残兵，战斗力比县警武装也强不了许多。我们在回路上沣县的大堰＠一役，一碰就碰掉他一个营，从此蒋匪军就害怕和我们接近。”李将军继称：“我们过江时是从江陵的郝穴南渡的，这是长江边上的一个重镇，未有任何正规兵丁把守。仅有的一个保安分队和一个镇公所，全被我解决了。我们从江南完成了既定任务北返时，是从枝江县城渡江的，在那里只有一个县政府的残余武装向我军抵抗，我军将他消灭后，即安然北渡。于此可见蒋匪后方空虚到什么程度了。”记者询以长江沿岸蒋匪之设防情形，李将军幽默的说：“这叫做设防不胜防；试问由上海到巴东，数千里长的江岸线渡口这样多，船只又便利，怎样布防呢？拿什么去布防呢？如果以横渡长江与横渡‘天险’的黄河相比，渡江显然是一件轻而易举的事。我们一年来的来去自如，便是明证。至于近来京汉一带蒋匪吹嘘什么‘江防巩固’云云，不过是一种自欺欺人之谈，也是表现其空虚与恐惧而已。”最后李将军历述江南人民对解放军的热望称：“江南人民对解放军非常热望与爱戴，这不单是他们有革命历史传统，和我军的纪律严明与开仓济贫所留给老百姓的良好印象，更重要的是我们摧毁了吮吸人民脂膏的蒋家乡保政权，使他们用不着再替四大家族出丁出粮。很多被‘预征’入伍的壮丁，闻悉我军到达，即前来请求予以保护。有些农民还派人前来要求我军到他们附近去驻扎。”
