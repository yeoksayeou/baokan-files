　　Lingdong Settles Accounts to Open Up Ideological Competition in Autumn Plowing
  　Only Cares About Sideline Occupations and Doesn't Turn the Soil
  　This Year, Two More Dan of Grain Were Lost
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] On August 28th, the Lingdong base point in the Second District convened a meeting of village cadres and activists to study the completion of the autumn harvest and launch a concentrated effort in autumn plowing. First, everyone was allowed to express their opinions on autumn plowing. Su Sanhao said, "My group feeds six livestock together, and everyone relies on the livestock and is unwilling to dig the land." The former village political director said, "September brings cool winds, and October brings a little warm weather. I say we should combine agriculture and sideline occupations: settle down with the land and make a fortune with business." The village head of Hetou said, "Wanting to make money from transportation delays the autumn harvest and the New Year." The village head of Guxian said, "I exchanged my donkey for a mule precisely to go to Handan, and one trip is worth more than a season's autumn harvest." The activist Fang Hai said, "Which village doesn't engage in transportation? Do you think only our village is like this?" Others believed that this year there was a lot of rain, and the women stepped on every clod of earth when they went to the fields, causing trouble for next spring. After understanding everyone's muddled understanding of autumn plowing, the leadership raised three questions for everyone to discuss: 1. Compare last year's plowing with not plowing; 2. What do we rely on to turn ourselves around? 3. Is it okay to rely solely on transportation? After repeated debates, Jia Juyou, the political director of Guxian, said, "Last year, I didn't plow four mu of land, and this year, I planted twice but still haven't captured all the seedlings." The former village head said, "Aren't we turning ourselves around by relying on land reform? Weren't we poor in the past because we didn't have gold bars to scrape?" The chairman of the Hetou Farmers' Association said, "We have to do specific accounting. Last autumn, we only engaged in transportation and earned more than one dan of rice, but we didn't plow more than twenty mu of land and lost more than two dan of grain. The grass in the fields didn't freeze to death, and there was especially a lot of grass, costing more than forty workdays a year, plus more than one dan of rice in wages. We spent the whole year just weeding. How does that add up?" The more they argued, the more energetic they became. After analysis and research, everyone unanimously said: The Hetou Farmers' Association chairman's calculations are correct. Everyone shouted slogans: "Men don't forget autumn plowing, women don't forget night spinning." Delaying transportation is temporary, delaying autumn plowing is a year's matter, the emphasis on sideline occupations and neglect of agriculture must be corrected, men, women, and children must take action together, autumn plowing must be grasped tightly, beware of the weather freezing, not plowing one mu of land means losing two dou of rice, this year, add oil to finish autumn plowing, next year's spring drought will not be difficult!" These vivid slogans moved the whole audience, and they said in unison: We must fully organize and launch a concentrated effort in autumn plowing. We must set our wages and increase the enthusiasm of the semi-auxiliary labor force. We will start tomorrow. Then, everyone studied the wage and work point recording methods, organized women and children to participate in digging the land, and implemented an 80/20 profit split with the families. On the spot, each village issued challenges to each other, and the enthusiasm was great. On the second day, the four villages of Guxian, Hetou, Langquan, and Yuan Village comprehensively started autumn plowing, and statistics showed that they plowed and dug more than 900 mu in one day.

　　岭东算帐打通思想竞赛秋耕
  　只顾副业不垡地
  　今年少打两石多
    【本报长治讯】二区岭东基点，八月二十八日召开各村干部积极分子会议，研究秋收已毕，突击秋耕。首先让大家发表对秋耕的意见，苏三好说：“我组伙喂牲口六个，大家都依靠牲口，不愿掘地。”原村政治主任说：“九月刮风凉，十月里小温天，我说咱们要农副结合：安家地土，发家的买卖。”河头村长说：“运输想要赚钱，误了秋收过年。”故县村长说：“我把驴换成骡，就是为了下邯郸，做一次买卖顶收一季秋。”积极分子方孩说：“那个村不搞运输？你以为光咱村这样吗？”还有的认为：今年雨水多，妇女上地尽蹈一地圪洞，给明年春季找麻烦呢。了解大家对秋耕的糊涂认识后，领导上提出三个问题让大家讨论：一、去年垡地和不垡地比一比；二、依靠什么来翻身？三、光靠运输行不行？经大家反复辩论，故县政治主任贾聚有说：“我去年有四亩地没犁，今年种了两遍还没捉全苗。”原村村长说：“咱们翻身还不是依靠土地改革，过去咱穷不是没刮金板？！”河头农会主席说：“得具体算帐呢，去年秋天光搞运输，赚了一石多米，二十多亩地没犁，少打粮食两石多，地里草没冻死，特别草大，一年费工四十多个，多费工资米一石多，一年忙的光锄草，那头合帐？”越吵越劲大，分析研究后，大家一致说：河头农会主席算的对。大家高喊口号：“男人不忘秋垡地，妇女不忘夜纺花。”误了运输是一时，误了秋耕一年事，重副轻农要纠正，男女老少齐行动，秋耕要抓紧，防备天要冻，不垡一亩地，少打二斗米，今年加油秋耕完，明年春旱不作难！”这些生动口号，感动全场，异口同音说：一定要全面组织，突击秋耕，咱们要把工资订好，提高半辅劳力劲头，明天就干。接着大家研究出工资及记工办法，组织妇女儿童参加掘地，和家庭实行二八分红，当场各村互相提出挑战，劲头很大。故县、河头、郎泉、原村四村，第二天全面下手秋耕，统计一天连犁带掘九百余亩。（振华、干才、成功、故县通讯组）
