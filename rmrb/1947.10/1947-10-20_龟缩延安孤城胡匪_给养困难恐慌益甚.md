Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 17th. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, huddled in the isolated city of Yan'an, are terrified by the power of the People's Liberation Army's great counter-offensive, and their supplies are becoming increasingly difficult. The bandits have recently demolished all the houses outside the North Gate and the "Eighth Route Army Auditorium" to meet the urgent need for materials for repairing fortifications and fuel. They have also erected straw men all over the hills in the suburbs, supplemented by a few mobile sentries, to disguise themselves as alert troops. According to recent escapees from Yan'an, the market in Yan'an is bleak, with few merchants and customers. Whenever night falls, the Chiang bandits close themselves up in their barracks, afraid to go out. The puppet Baojia chiefs have repeatedly and strictly demanded 100 to 150 shi of wheat from each bao. The people have firmly refused, but they risk their lives to secretly support the guerrillas. The masses in two villages, XX, passed through the enemy's blockade line overnight to deliver grain to the guerrillas. An old farmer from XX village led two children, carrying eggplants, tomatoes, peppers, cabbage, beans, and 1,200 fresh peaches they had grown themselves, and rushed through the enemy's警戒线, to comfort the troops. Women in XX village made military shoes, had their husbands and sons wear them, and sent them to the guerrillas, deceiving the Chiang Kai-shek army's inspection. Under the ingenious cover of the masses, the guerrillas have achieved surprising victories, recently capturing 27 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, including a company commander, in the eastern suburbs of Yan'an, and seizing two machine guns and ten long and short guns.

　　龟缩延安孤城胡匪
  　给养困难恐慌益甚
    【新华社西北十七日电】龟缩延安孤城的蒋胡匪军，慑于解放军大反攻的威力，军心极为恐慌，给养日趋困难。匪徒们近已将北门外的民房和“八路军大礼堂”全部拆毁，以应修工事燃料之急需，并在市郊山头遍扎草人，配以少数流动哨兵，伪装为警戒部队。据最近由延安逃出的来人说：延安市面萧条，商客稀少。每当夜幕降临，蒋匪即深闭营房内，不敢外出。伪保甲长会三令五申，向每保强索麦子一百至一百五十石。人民均坚决予以拒绝，但却冒着生命危险暗中支援游击队。某某两村群众连夜通过敌封锁线，给游击队送粮；某村老农领着两个儿童，担着自己种的茄子、西红柿、辣子、白菜、豆角和一千二百个鲜桃，冲过敌警戒线，前去劳军。某村妇女们做好军鞋，交自己丈夫和儿子穿上，瞒过蒋军的检查送，给游击队。在群众机智的掩护下，游击队出奇制胜，近又在延安东郊生擒蒋军连长以下二十七名，缴获机枪二挺，长短枪十枝。
