The Liming Drama Troupe Summarizes Two Years of Experience and Sets Future Directions in Preparation for the Second Taihang Cultural Conference

　　I. Development Overview

　　The Liming Drama Troupe has a history of seven years. It has constantly explored, encountered setbacks, and re-explored its direction in theatrical operations, finally breaking away from the rigid shell of the old opera troupe and becoming a brand-new troupe – a troupe completely belonging to the people. Especially in the two years since the Taihang Cultural Conference, its development has been even faster, especially from the implementation of land reform last year to the present, which has been a period of rapid progress, with a qualitative change – using the peasants’ tone, the peasants’ attitude, and learning and mastering new techniques to perform peasant affairs, making the audience feel exceptionally harmonious and in sync. Licheng's development in production campaigns and support for the self-defense war owes much to the Liming Drama Troupe.

　　In the past two years, according to incomplete statistics, it has created 15 new plays, adapted 31 new plays, helped perform 5 peasant plays, and countless timely clapper talks. At the beginning of the spring plowing in 1945, it first compiled "Organize!" and promoted it throughout the county in a typical demonstration in Renzhuang, performing everywhere the cooperative hero Lang Fengbiao and the textile model Tong Xizhi, making the entire county's production outlook completely new. In particular, after the performance of "Shi Cunjin's Success" in 1946, it played an infinite role in promoting the realization of "cultivate three days, rest one" throughout the county. Later, "Report of Merit" performed during the patriotic self-defense war, and "The Trap" and "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" with land reform as the theme, all received favorable reviews. Therefore, it is widely reflected among the masses: "The Liming Drama Troupe is making rapid progress; the troupe is our own."

　　The number of plays last year was four times that of the previous year. However, in the actors' thinking, many still resisted new plays, and they were not attentive during rehearsals and previews, thinking that it was enough to go on stage. They had no confidence in learning the music scores, and the singing was in the noisy tune, and the playing was with old instruments, so when the scene sounded, they couldn't help but prop up some feudal airs and take a few feudal steps. After this year's New Year's cultural and entertainment competition and the stimulation of going to the front line to comfort the troops, they finally decided to destroy the old set, and small-scale song and dance dramas have since gained the upper hand.

　　II. Experiences and Summary

　　In the two years of struggle, it has taken many detours to achieve the above results. Summarized, there are the following points of experience:

　　1. Vigorously mobilize the basic masses in the troupe. In dividing the old and new forces in the troupe, we should focus on the class viewpoint, not use the level of culture as a yardstick. Only by mobilizing the basic masses, having a core, and having leadership, is it the basic force for transforming and consolidating the troupe. Righteousness belongs to the basic masses. Grasping this point, new plays can develop rapidly, and old artists can be quickly transformed. In 1945, we took a big detour because we regarded old artists as "backward people" and regarded the newly entered ones as "new blood," resulting in disunity between the two sides. Subsequently, we only paid attention to uniting the old artists and ignored education. We focused on raising the status of "good performers" and rewarding "good performers" in profit-sharing. Therefore, although it seemed that a few new programs and new clapper talks were added, the basic righteousness was not promoted, and the old roots were not shaken much; on the contrary, some so-called "new blood" also turned to the old plays. Later, through continuous education and organizational rectification, especially after the land reform last winter, many old artists completely turned over, and their level of awareness was unprecedentedly improved. Zhao Ruanzhi used to be a "bachelor," and because he sang Hua Lian (painted face), no one looked up to him. Later, due to the improvement of the actor's status, he got married. Jiang Tongzhen is an immigrant from Hebei. In the land reform, he was allocated a house and land, and he was determined to serve the masses by performing new plays well. Under such a heat wave, the troupe suddenly changed. This shows that the decisive factor is the class consciousness of the old artists with good origins or other troupe members from poor peasants. The external so-called "new blood" can only play a certain role to a certain extent for a certain period of time – a bridging role.

　　2. Mobilize all actors to face reality, go deep into reality, and improve the political quality of actors, understand the feelings of peasants, and adapt to the requirements of the situation from actual activities and struggles. In this way, the plays written and performed can be lively and vivid, the forms can be continuously improved, and the techniques can be gradually improved. Before last year, the investigation and research work was often assigned to a few cadres and intellectuals to be responsible for, and the general actors rarely participated, so the development of the troupe was always slow. During the land reform movement last winter, some actors participated in the movement; during the New Year's cultural and entertainment this year, many artists also went to the countryside to help rural troupes compile and perform turn-over dramas. This spring, they collectively went to Tangyin to comfort the troops and intern in the life of the war zone. After July 1st, a movement to squeeze out special agents was launched in the troupe. From these series of practical activities and struggles, the actors have gained great political training, their emotions are full, their spirits are radiant, they automatically learn music scores, automatically reduce profit-sharing, voluntarily give up evening meals, and perform more seriously. It can be said that they are full of vitality and completely new.

　　3. Accurately grasp the masses' thoughts, collect typical materials, and focus on the center with a clear purpose. Take the lead in the central work, and do not conduct general and fragmented investigations and follow the central work behind. For example, when promoting "cultivate three days, rest one," if there is a fear of getting rich, then compile and perform "Shi Cunjin's Success" and so on immediately.

　　4. Improving business and establishing a family are integrated, and the purpose is to improve the troupe's work. In the autumn of the Great Advance two years ago, the two were separated, and the "export" (running outside the stage) thought was quite serious. After the "export" thought subsided, but every time they went to a village, they always first calculated the makeup fee, so the general public's voice was "the play price is too high, can't afford to watch it." Therefore, the troupe was also in a state of stagnation. Later, especially this spring, they devoted themselves to rehearsing the plays and performing them well. The makeup fee was given by the masses themselves. This time, at the city's conference performance, the Chamber of Commerce gave an additional 30,000 yuan bonus in addition to the makeup fee. They said, "This time the performance was good, the actors were all attentive, and they should be rewarded extra." This proves that as long as the business is improved and the work is done well, the masses can take care of the actors' lives. Conversely, if the establishment of a family is isolated, the troupe will inevitably be suspended.

　　5. To improve business, it is necessary to improve the cultural level of the actors. In the past two years, cultural learning has generally been paid attention to. Many actors can write notes, most actors can practice reading drama lyrics, and technical improvements have also begun to be made. However, the general social knowledge and production knowledge are still very poor, and in the future, attention should be paid to constantly improving and improving them.

　　III. Future Directions

　　Facing the countryside, studying the countryside, paying attention to current affairs, focusing on the center of work, grasping typical materials; grasping seasonality, using small-scale song and dance dramas to immediately reflect and praise the peasants. And take the base point village as a unit, perform in rotation, and take care of the mountain villages and shacks. Secondly, carry out the meritorious service campaign, on stage is an actor, off stage is a propagandist, and improve the business to ensure the realization of the propaganda purpose.

　　迎接太行二届文教会黎明剧团总结二年经验定出今后方针
    一、发展概况
    黎明剧团已有七年历史了。在剧运方向上不断摸索、碰壁与再摸索，终于摆脱旧了戏班子的硬壳，变成一个崭新的剧团——完全属于人民的剧团。特别是在太行改届文教会以来的二年，发展的更快，其中尤以去年实行土改以后到现在，为突飞猛进时期，在质上起了变化——以农民口吻农民姿态及学习掌握新的技术表演农民事，使台下人看起来分外觉得融洽和合拍。黎城在生产运动的开展，自卫战争之支援，得力于黎明剧团是不少的。
    二年来，据不完全的统计，共创作新剧十五个，改编新剧三十一个，帮助演出农剧五个，应时快板则数不胜数。四五年春耕一开始，即首编“组织起来”，在仁庄典型示范推动全县，到处表演合作英雄郎风标，纺织模范童喜枝，使全县生产面貌一新。特别是四六年“石寸金发家”演出后，对全县耕三余一的实现是起了无限的推动作用的。其后在爱国自卫战争时演出的“报功单”，及以翻身土改为主题的“圈套”“王贵与李香香”都获得好评，因此在群众中普遍反映：“黎明剧团进步快，剧团是咱们自己的。”
    去年剧作的数量，四倍于前年。但在演员的思想上，有好多对新剧还有抵触，在排演及预演时，不用心，以为能上台即行了。对学歌谱没有信心，加以唱的是闹腔调，奏的是旧乐器，所以场面一响，不由的要撑两下封建架，迈两个封建步。经过今年年关文娱的竞赛，与到前线劳军时的刺激，于是下定决心摧毁一套，小型的歌舞剧从此占了上风。
    二、经验及总结
    二年的斗争过程中，是经过好多迂回曲折，才收到如上效果的。综合起来有以下几点经验：
    一、大力发动剧团中的基本群众。在划分剧团新旧力量上，应以阶级观点来着眼，不应以文化水平作标尺。只有把基本群众发动起来，有核心，有带头，才是改造与巩固剧团的基本力量。正气是属于基本群众的。抓紧这一点，新剧可以迅速发展，旧艺人可以迅速得到改造。四五年曾经走了一段大弯路，原因是把旧艺人看作是“落后人”，把新派进去的都当做是“新血液”，结果造成两方面的不团结。随后对旧艺人又只注意团结，而忽视了教育。偏重在地位上抬举“好把式”，在分红上奖励“好把式”。因此表面看起来虽然多添了几个新节目、新快板，基本上正气是没有发扬出来的，旧根子是没有多大摇撼的；相反地有个别所谓“新血液”也转向旧剧那方面去。后来在不断地教育，与组织整顿中，特别是在去冬土改以后，有好多旧艺人彻底翻了身，觉悟程度空前提高。赵软枝过去是个“光棍汉”，加上他是唱花脸的，更没人看得起，后来由于演员地位的提高结了婚。姜同祯是河北来的移民，土改中分到房分到地，下决心要在演好新剧上来为群众服务。在这样的热潮下剧团突变了。从此说明决定的因素，是在出身成份好的旧艺人或其他贫苦农民出身的剧团团员的阶级觉悟，外在的所谓“新血液”，只能在一定的时间中，起着一定程度的作用——桥梁作用。
    二、发动全体演员面向实际，深入实际，从现实活动与斗争中提高演员的政治素质，体会农民感情，适应形势要求。这样编、演的剧，可以生动活泼，形式可以不断改进，技术可以逐渐提高。去年以前在调查研究工作上往往是责成几个干部与知识分子来负责，一般演员很少参加，所以在剧团的发展上总是慢步走。去冬土改运动中，部分演员参加了运动；今年年关文娱，有好多艺人也下乡帮助农村剧团编演翻身剧。今春又集体到汤阴去劳军，实习了战地的生活，“七一”后又在剧团来了个挤特务的运动。从这些一连串的现实活动与斗争中，演员在政治上得到很大的锻炼，情绪饱满、精神焕发，自动学歌谱，自动少分红，自愿去掉夜饭，演戏也更加认真，可说生气勃勃、焕然一新。
    三、摸准群众思想，搜集典型材料，围绕中心，有的放矢。在中心工作中起带头，不作一般地泛泛地调查，支离破碎地跟在中心工作后面走。如在推进耕三余一时，产生怕富思想，就即时编演“石寸金发家”等。
    四、改进业务与建立家务是一体的，目的都是为了把剧团工作搞好。前年秋天大进军时，把二者割裂开来，“出口”（跑外台）思想相当严重。“出口”思想平息了以后，但每到一个村，总是首先计较化装费，因此群众普遍呼声是“戏价大看不起”。因此剧团亦陷于停顿的状态了。后来，特别是今春专心致志于排剧，把剧演好，化装费由群众自己给，这次在城内大会上演出，商联会除给了化装费外，又给了三万元奖励金。他们说：“这次演的好，演员们都尽心，应该额外奖励。”从此证明只要业务提高了，工作做好了，群众是能够照顾演员生活的。反之把建立家务孤立起来搞，剧团必然会悬空。
    五、要提高业务，必需提高演员的文化水平。二年来对文化学习一般说是注意了。不少演员能写笔记，大部演员能练习读剧词，技术的改进也开始在做。但一般社会知识生产知识还都很差，今后需注意经常不断地使其提高再提高。
    三、今后方针
    面向农村，研究农村，注意时事，围绕工作中心，抓取典型材料；掌握季节性用小型歌舞剧，即时反映农民、歌颂农民。并以基点村为单位，轮回演出，照顾山庄窝铺。其次开展立功运动，上台是演员，下台是宣传员，提高业务保证宣传目的实现。
