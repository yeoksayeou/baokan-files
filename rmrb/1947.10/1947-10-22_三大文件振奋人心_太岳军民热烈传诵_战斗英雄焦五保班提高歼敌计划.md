　　The Three Major Documents Inspire People
　　Taiyue Military and Civilians Enthusiastically Spread Them
　　Combat Hero Jiao Wubao's Platoon Raises the Plan to Annihilate the Enemy
　　[Report from our Taiyue office on the 20th] After receiving the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Declaration and Slogans and other documents, the anti-offensive spirit of all sectors in Taiyue has become even higher. Cadres in the military region's political department said after reading this historical document: "Wonderful! We have long hoped to fight all the way to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive." Comrades in the newspaper office said: "This is the Chinese people's indictment of Chiang Kai-shek; the date of Chiang Kai-shek's death has been decided in this document." Cadres who had travelled north from Yuebei to the south eagerly circulated the documents after receiving them, further increasing their confidence. They said, "The Central government's official announcement has been issued, and Chiang Kai-shek is definitely finished soon!" The troops fighting on the front lines are even more high-spirited and a hundred times more courageous. In the annihilation pledge written by the famous combat hero Jiao Wubao's platoon, they quickly added the annihilation of an entire platoon's worth of weapons from Chiang's regular army, as well as the capture of a machine gun, as a gift to the declaration. Lang Xinhui, who was wounded in the Zhangwu battle in Linfen, returned to his unit without waiting to recover after hearing someone read the document in the sanatorium. He said, "I was so anxious, I had to hurry back to join the battle." In particular, Hao Xiaogeng, a liberated farmer in Nanguan, Yangcheng, said after hearing someone read the People's Liberation Army's Declaration and Slogans to him: "This is exactly what I had in mind. We must struggle against and control little Chiang Kai-shek, and we must fight all the way to Nanjing to capture big Chiang Kai-shek alive and confiscate his property." After hearing the slogans of "Everyone has food to eat, everyone has clothes to wear, everyone has a house to live in, and everyone has books to read," he said: "Yes, I used to have no house to live in and never went to school, and I was always worried; now I have a house to live in, and my children are going to school, and I am so happy! If all the poor people in China become like this, wouldn't everyone be laughing heartily?" The District Party Committee and the Military Region also issued instructions on studying and publicizing the three major documents, calling on cadres at all levels of the Party, government, military, and people throughout the district to study the three major documents carefully, improve their ability to thoroughly implement them, and welcome victory. The Yuebei Prefectural Party Committee instructed cadres at all levels to study seriously and conduct discussions. The masses should use mutual aid groups to widely explain and publicize them. Theater troupes and others should use live performances, drum books, clapper talks, and other forms to widely publicize them, and invite playwright Guan Shouyao to write drum lyrics and other popular reading materials. All villages should wash off old slogans and write these new slogans.

  　太岳军民热烈传诵
    战斗英雄焦五保班提高歼敌计划
    【本报太岳二十日电】太岳各界接获中国人民解放军宣言与口号等文件后，反攻情绪更趋高昂。军区政治部干部读了这一历史文件后说：“痛快，早就盼望打到南京去，活捉蒋介石。”报社同志说：“这是中国人民的讨蒋书，蒋介石的死亡期已被决定在这文件上。”岳北南征干部得到文件后，争相传阅，更增加信心。他们说：“中央的正式文告下来了，蒋介石决定快完蛋啦！”在前方作战的部队更是情绪高昂，勇气百倍，著名战斗英雄焦五保班的歼敌保证书中，赶快增加了歼敌正规军一个班武器全部，并缴获机枪一挺，作为对宣言的献礼。在临汾张吴战斗中负伤的朗心会，在休养所听人读了这文件后，不等伤愈，就归队了。他说：“可把我急坏了，赶快参加战斗。”尤其是阳城南关翻身农民郝小庚，听人给他读了人民解放军的宣言与口号后说：“这说的和我脑筋里想的一模一样，小蒋介石我们要斗争他，管制他，大蒋介石我们还要打到南京去，活捉住他，没收他的家产。”他听到人人有饭吃，人人有衣穿，人人有屋住，人人有书读的口号后说：“对，我从前没房住，没念过书，满天愁气；现在我有了房屋住，娃和闺女都念书，可高兴啦！全中国的穷人都成了这样，你看不是大家哈哈大笑吗。”区党委及军区并发出学习与宣传三大文件的指示，号召全区党政军民各级干部好好学习三大文件，提高自己切实贯澈执行，迎接胜利。岳北地委指示各级干部认真学习，展开讨论。群众要通过互助组广泛讲解宣传。剧团等要以活报、鼓书、快板等形式广泛宣传，并邀请剧作家关守耀编写鼓词等各种通俗读物。各村一律洗刷旧标语，涂写这些新口号。
