On the Discussion of Comrade Mian Zuobu's Self-Criticism

Recently, we received two opinions on Comrade Mian Zuobu's self-criticism, which are published here for everyone to discuss.

(I)

After reading Comrade Mian Zuobu's article "Never Again Be an Air Raid Shelter for a Landlord's Daughter" published on page four of the September 29th issue, I would like to offer my opinion. Please discuss its merits, comrades.

In Comrade Mian Zuobu's self-criticism, from the question of "who is his wife closer to," he recognized his wife's obvious landlord stance and that his wife was an enemy of his class. He then revealed the actual situation of himself being an "air raid shelter" for the landlord. However, he wrote the following in his article:

"I thought to myself that to break with the landlord class, I must completely sever ties with my wife's family and never interact with them again, but I didn't have the courage to resolutely divorce my wife.

Some comrades advocated for a clean break and divorce, but I also thought, would divorce solve the problem ideologically? That is to say, if this air raid shelter is not dug open, but the person seeking shelter is pulled away from the entrance, can it be guaranteed that no one else will come to hide again? This cannot be guaranteed. So, the key issue today is not a clean break of divorce or no divorce, but a matter of making up my mind to reflect ideologically. If I truly recognize that being an air raid shelter is wrong and dig open the air raid shelter, handing everything over to the peasants to deal with, will the people hiding inside still sit still? Will the peasants not know how to deal with the people inside?"

Here, Comrade Mian Zuobu says that he "doesn't have the courage to resolutely divorce his wife," but then "also thought, would divorce solve the problem ideologically?" This shows us the key to the ideological problem existing in Comrade Mian Zuobu's thinking. I believe the reason why this ideological problem has not been thoroughly resolved lies here.

According to Comrade Mian Zuobu's idea, ideological resolution is the main thing. Therefore, he says: "The key issue is not a clean break of divorce or no divorce." However, everyone knows that the emergence of an air raid shelter is due to the presence of people seeking shelter. Comrade Mian Zuobu's landlord class ideology did not arise out of thin air. Ultimately, it is due to that landlord wife. I do not object to mainly solving the ideological problem, but eliminating the root of the evil environment (divorce and never interacting with the wife's family) is a prerequisite for resolute transformation, and this is precisely for the sake of solving the ideological problem. Having the determination to sever ties with the landlord class wife and wife's family means having the determination to solve the ideological problem. These are not two separate matters, but precisely the same thing! As Comrade Mian Zuobu said at the end of his self-criticism, "Father-in-law, mother-in-law, etc., I find them dispensable, but I always have some attachment to my wife. So, this is the key." That is, the key for Comrade Mian Zuobu, who is being used as a landlord's air raid shelter, to completely dig out this air raid shelter.

Editor Comrades: After reading the article "Never Again Be an 'Air Raid Shelter' for a Landlord's Daughter" published on page four of your newspaper on September 29th, we would like to raise the following points for discussion.

First, to save time and space, we will set aside the merits of Comrade Mian's spirit of candid self-criticism. We will only talk about what we believe is insufficient in his self-criticism. From the title of his article, "Never Again Be an Air Raid Shelter for a Landlord's Daughter," one would immediately think that Comrade Mian has already solved his problem, that is, he is no longer the landlord's daughter's air raid shelter. However, after reading the entire article, we believe that he has not thoroughly solved the problem. Because:

(1) In the eighth point, he says, "To break with the landlord class, I must completely sever ties with my wife's family... but I don't have the courage to divorce." Everyone knows that the reason you became an air raid shelter and established deep and close ties with the landlord's family is precisely this wife you are infatuated with! Since you don't have the courage to divorce and haven't sought a suitable and effective way to solve the problem, how can you talk about not being an air raid shelter? In the same point, you also say, "Would divorce solve the problem ideologically?" Then where does a person's thinking come from? Isn't it based on a certain objective existence and reflected in human thinking? If so, if you simply get a divorce, you will not only practically eliminate the annoyance of the so-called air raid shelter, but you will also feel relaxed ideologically. As for saying, "If the air raid shelter is not dug open, but the person seeking shelter is pulled away from the entrance, can it be guaranteed that no one else will come to hide again?" This is even more of your unnecessary worry, because you are a revolutionary, you have a certain stand, and since you yourself are the air raid shelter, why can't you guarantee that you won't be an air raid shelter again? Why can't you eliminate your own air raid shelter ideologically! Are you still afraid that "someone else will come to hide again!"

(2) In the ninth point, you say that the key lies with your wife. We say that the key lies entirely with yourself. For example, if Chiang Kai-shek attacks the liberated areas, if the Eighth Route Army and the people do not actively surround and annihilate him, he will not retreat. (Naturally, we should not ignore that people can change for the better, but that requires certain objective conditions).

(3) In the tenth point, you have already checked and concluded that the landlord's daughter has not made progress and has not stood on the peasants' side. Then, the following text should be how you end this air raid shelter that you built in collusion with the landlord, but there is no follow-up—there is no follow-up.

We believe that there are only two ways to solve your problem. One is a more moderate one, which is to write a letter and hand your wife over to the village government in her original hometown, so that the masses can handle her and her parents together in the same case. The masses will give them historical punishment according to the severity of their crimes. If necessary, the masses will let your wife live through a not-so-short period of hardship, but this is precisely a newborn refining furnace that will refine all the feudal stench from her and turn her into a brand-new person. Then you can take her back and remarry, wouldn't that be great? If, after a period of time, she is still unrepentant, then you can finally announce the divorce. The second way is to simply divorce, hand her over to her original village for processing, and sincerely express that you will support the masses, and ask no further questions.

Finally, there is one more point worth mentioning, which is that in your notes, you did not clearly introduce your class composition. Therefore, people cannot more deeply understand the ideological roots of your mistakes and being an "air raid shelter."

Jiang Yiping, Li Kai, October 14th.

### 怎样才能挖掉“防空洞”？

专栏：

　　怎样才能挖掉“防空洞”？
    对免作布同志反省的讨论
    最近收到两篇对于免作布同志反省的意见，一并发表在这里，希大家讨论。
     ——编者
    （一）
    读了九月二十九日四版发表免作布同志“再不给地主女儿当防空洞”一文，提出我的一点意见，对否，请同志们讨论。
    在免作布同志的反省中，从“老婆究竟和谁亲”的问题，认识到老婆的显明的地主立场，认识到老婆是自己阶级的敌人，并由此揭发了自己给地主当了“防空洞”的实际情况。但在他的文章中这样写着：
    “自己这样想，要想和地主阶级分家，必须和丈人家一刀两断，永不交往，可是没有勇气和老婆坚决离婚。
    有的同志主张干脆离婚，可是我又这样想离了婚是不是思想上就解决问题了呢？就是说，这个防空洞没有挖开，而只是把防空者从洞口上拉走，这样是不是就会没有人再来隐蔽呢？这是不敢保证的，所以说今天的问题关键不是一刀两断离婚与不离婚的问题，而就是思想上下决心反省的问题。如果咱的思想上真正认识了作防空洞的不应当，把防空洞挖开了，一切交农民处理，这样防空洞里面隐蔽的人还会坐着不动吗？农民还会不知如何处理里面的人吗？”
    在这里，免作布同志说自己“没有勇气和老婆坚决离婚”，但随即“又这样想，离了婚是不是思想上就解决问题了呢？”这里使我们看出存在于免作布同志思想问题上的关键，这一思想问题之所以尚未得到彻底的解决，我认为原因就在这里。
    照免布同志的意思是，思想解决为主，因此他说：“问题关键不是一刀两断离婚与不离婚的问题。”殊不知防空洞的出现就是因为有防空人的原故，免作布同志的地主阶级思想也不是凭空产生的，归根结底，还是由于那个地主老婆所致。我不反对主要在解决思想问题，但肃清环境之恶根（离婚和丈人永不交往），是有决心改造的先决条件，而这也正是为的解决思想问题；有决心和地主阶级的老婆及丈人割断关系，就有决心解决思想问题；这不是两回事情，恰恰是一回事情啊！正如免作布同志在他反省到最后的时候所说的“丈人丈母等等自己倒觉扯蛋，而对老婆总有些留恋，所以说这就是个关键。”也就是被作为地主防空洞的免作布同志彻底把这防空洞挖掉的关键。

    编辑同志：我们读了九月二十九日贵报四版载的“再不给地主女儿当‘防空洞’一文之后，有以下数点提出研究。
    首先，为了节省时间与篇幅，我们撇开如免同志坦白反省的精神等好处不谈。现只谈些我们认为他这反省中不够的地方。从他这篇文章的大标题“再不给地主女儿当防空洞”来看，叫人立刻会想到免同志已是把自己的问题解决过了，就是说他已不是地主女儿的防空洞了。但我们把全篇文章读完以后呢，却认为他并未彻底的解决了问题。因为：
    （一）他在第八点里说“要想和地主阶级分家必须和丈人家一刀两断……可是又没有勇气离婚”。大家知道，你所以当了防空洞，以至和地主家建立了深厚而密切的联系，正是你所醉心的这个老婆！你既没勇气离婚，也未寻求一适当而有效的办法去解决问题，那如何能谈到不当防空洞呢？同条里你又说“离了是不是思想上就解决问题了呢？”那么人的思想是从那来的，它还不是根据一定的客观存在而反映到人的思维里来的吗？既如此，你干脆离了婚，不仅在实际上取消了所谓防空洞的烦扰，即在思想上也会感到轻松了。至于说“防空洞没有挖开，而只是把防空者从洞口上拉走，这样是不是就会没有人再来隐蔽呢？”这更是你多余的担忧，因为你是个革命分子，你有一定的立场，防空洞既是你自己，你为什么不能保证不再当防空洞？为什么不能从思想上清除了自己的防空洞！还怕“有人再来隐蔽呢！”
    （二）第九条里说关键在于老婆，我们说关键全在你自己，譬如说蒋介石打到解放区来了，八路军和人民不积极的包围与歼灭他，他就不会退出去。（自然我们不要忽视人是会转变好的，但那非有一定的客观条件不行）。
    （三）第十条中，你既检查的结果，是地主的闺女没有进步和站到农民立场上来。那么下文应该是怎样结束你这个与地主通力合作而建造的防空洞的问题，但却没有——没有下文。
    我们认为，你的问题只有两条解决的道路，一个是温和些的，这便是写信把自己的老婆交给原籍的村公所，让群众把她和她的父母并案处理，群众会按她们罪恶的重轻予以历史的惩办，如果必要的话，群众会让你的老婆过一个不短时期的困难生活，但这正是一个新生的炼冶炉，会把她身上一切封建的毒臭炼掉，而成为一个崭新的人物。这时你再把她接回来，再度伉俪岂不很好。如果经过了一个时期之后，她仍执迷不悟，你则最后宣布离婚。第二个道路就是干脆离婚，交原村去处理，并虔诚的表示要为群众撑腰，余不闻问。
    最后，还有一点值得提出，就是在你这篇笔记里，没有明确的把你的阶级成份介绍出来，因之人们对你犯了错误，当了“防空洞”的思想根源，不能更深切的认识。
