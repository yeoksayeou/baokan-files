　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd: The masses in Northeast China who have been emancipated are enthusiastically launching a campaign to donate money and iron to support the front lines. During a mobilization meeting in Harbin in mid-August, over 31.85 million yuan in consolation money was received in four days, along with items worth tens of millions of yuan donated by emancipated workers in various industries. From August 26th to early September, Mudanjiang City received donations of 100.683 million yuan, along with seven taels of pure gold. Emancipated farmers in Heilongjiang and Hejiang donated over 50 million yuan. In early September, Zunhua, Hebei Province, held a celebration meeting to support the front after land reform. Zhao Tai, a representative from both urban and rural areas, proposed at the meeting: "In addition to donating money to support the front lines, we should also donate scrap iron to manufacture artillery shells and bullets to send to the front to kill the enemy." This call was approved by everyone, and a vigorous iron donation movement was launched throughout the county. As of now, according to incomplete statistics, over 80,000 jin of copper, iron, and tin have been donated. During the movement, Wang Hui, Zhang Tianbao, and others, farmers from Xinhai County, Mudanjiang, also donated three rifles and nearly two hundred bullets. Shang Guo, a widow from Qingmei Village in the county, also donated the seven-star gun her late husband had buried for many years to the democratic government. Farmers in various parts of Liaobei not only donated large amounts of cash but also donated 20,000 eggs to comfort the soldiers at the front. The elementary school students of Beiguan Elementary School in Hulan County, Songjiang, also donated all 500 eggs they had saved to comfort the warriors on the front lines of the patriotic self-defense war.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd: Over six hundred militiamen and stretcher-bearers from the Second District of Lingnan (i.e., Jianchang, south of Lingyuan) County went to the western Liaoning front to participate in the war. On the 10th of last month, the district was holding a meeting of peasant representatives. At noon, they suddenly received a mobilization order for war service. The representatives went back to make arrangements. By dusk, a scene of intense activity had emerged in each village. Some were busy organizing stretchers, some were busy sewing backpacks, and women were busy making dry rations and comforting cloth socks. By dawn the next morning, all six hundred people and one hundred and twenty stretchers had assembled, divided into two companies, each equipped with a part of the militia, and led by the district head to the battlefield. When they saw batches of Chiang Kai-shek's captured soldiers, they were particularly excited and eager to try, ready to kill the enemy and make contributions.
