　　Directly Lead the Peasant Struggle
  　Jin-Sui Establishes Border Region Farmers' Association
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 16th dispatch] In order to lead the peasant struggle, thoroughly and equally distribute land, and eliminate the landlord class, Jin-Sui has successively begun to transform farmers' associations in various places, and the region-wide peasant representative conference is also being actively prepared. The preparatory committee of the Border Region Farmers' Association has just been established and has quickly gained the enthusiastic support of farmers in various places. It has also been unanimously suggested that it be renamed the "Jin-Sui Border Region Farmers' Association Provisional Committee" in order to directly lead the peasant struggle in various places. The association has accepted this suggestion and has officially begun operating in Xing County. In its establishment announcement, it declared: "This association is the organ for farmers to speak, and it is also an organ with power. Farmers can elect representatives to discuss any issues." It also said, "This association can help solve all issues related to the interests of the farmers themselves in the land reform." The Jin-Sui Border Region Farmers' Association has sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, congratulating the People's Liberation Army on the victorious start of the great counter-offensive and stating: From now on, it will call on and lead the three million farmers of Jin-Sui to thoroughly implement land reform, eliminate feudal exploitation, and overthrow the bandit chiefs Jiang, Hu, Yan, and Fu.

　　直接领导农民斗争
  　晋绥成立边区农会
    【新华社晋绥十六日电】为领导农民斗争，彻底平分土地，消灭地主阶级，晋绥各地先后着手改造农会，全区农民代表大会亦在积极筹备中。边区农会筹委会甫告成立，迅得各地农民热烈拥护，并经一致建议改名为“晋绥边区农会临时委员会。”以便直接领导各地农民斗争。该会已接受此建议，并在兴县正式开始办公，在其成立启事中宣布：“本会是农民说话的机关，同时又是有权力的机关，农民们有什么问题，都可以选派代表来商量。”并说“土地改革中有关农民自己的一切利益问题，本会都可帮助解决。”晋绥边区农会顷致电毛主席、朱总司令、庆贺人民解放军大反攻胜利开始，并表示：今后将号召与领导晋绥三百万农民，彻底实行土改，消灭封建剥削，打倒蒋、胡、阎、傅匪首。
