To all levels of post offices, local offices, and correspondents:

　　In order to encourage writing and facilitate communication, it has been agreed that, starting from October 1st, all manuscripts sent to People's Daily and New Masses Press need only have the word "Manuscript" marked on the envelope and the upper left corner of the envelope cut open. No postage stamps are required for mailing at local post offices. The owed postage will be settled uniformly with the post office by the newspaper and New Masses Press (manuscripts sent through military post offices are completely free of charge). If the sent item is not a manuscript for communication purposes, it will be handled as underpaid postage upon verification, and a double fee will be charged.

　　However, the postage for printed materials such as local newspapers sent from various places is still to be paid by the sender and is not covered by this rule. Please note.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 Issued jointly by People's Daily, New Masses, and the Directorate General of Posts

　　人民日报、新大众、邮政总局联合通知各级邮局、各地办公室暨通讯员同志：
    为鼓励写稿，便利通讯起见，经商定自十月一日起，凡寄交人民日报及新大众社之稿件，只须在封面上证明“稿件”二字，并将信封左上角剪开，即可不贴邮票向各地邮局交寄，所欠邮资由报馆及新大众社统一与邮局结付（经军邮局交寄之稿件则一律免费），如所寄并非通讯稿件，一经查出，即按欠资办理，加倍纳费。
    但各地所寄小报等印刷品之邮资仍旧自付，不在此例，希注意。
