[Reported by our newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 26th] To cooperate with the southward advance of the Liu-Deng army, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan militia explosive teams laid landmines everywhere, blockading enemy and puppet strongholds, and repeatedly achieved remarkable results. The Juancheng explosive team, led by Yang Rongzhen, advanced towards the enemy stronghold of Fangmiao in the rain on September 2. After arriving near the Fangmiao stronghold, clarifying the enemy situation and preparing the mine-laying tools, they divided into three groups to set up landmines around the stronghold and wrote on wooden signs above the landmines: "Big Bad Guy Zhang Bolin!" (Note: This refers to Zhang Bolin, the Kuomintang puppet county head of Juancheng.) "Turtle Zhang Hanjie" (puppet district head), etc. The next morning, after breakfast, the enemies in Fangmiao set off in different directions. The enemy regular army company and more than 40 members of the Home Return Corps on the east road had the leader of the Home Return Corps, Li Daosheng, walking in the front. When Li walked in front of the wooden sign and saw the words scolding the Home Return Corps, he became enraged and immediately gathered more than ten people to remove the wooden sign together. With a "boom" explosion, Li Daosheng's right arm was blown off, seven enemy soldiers were either killed or wounded, and they were all mixed up and fell around the sign. The enemies returning from the north blockhouse also stepped on two landmines, and three enemy soldiers were also severely injured. From June 26 to August 6, the Changyuan militia laid mines three times, killing and wounding eight enemies. On August 25, the fourth mine-laying killed and wounded three more enemies. More than ten members of the Home Return Corps of the Japanese puppet Cultural Township, cooperating with a part of the puppet Shang Dengkong's troops, invaded Qiuliu Temple. Our militia divided into groups to lure them in and launched a counterattack. The enemy Home Return Corps desperately fled back and stepped on a landmine, seriously injuring two and blowing one into minced meat. After suffering this blow, the enemies were panicked and fled back to the city in confusion. This explosion was commended by the Military Committee of the sub-district and awarded 50 landmines and 10,000 Jilu banknotes. The Minquan militia explosive team, operating to block the Min-Cao Highway, set up mines on July 24, wounding two soldiers of the KMT 206th Division and capturing one alive. On August 14, they cooperated in setting up an ambush with mines, again capturing three soldiers of the KMT 206th Division alive, and liberating two civilians who had been forcibly conscripted. Under the mine ambushes set up by our militia explosive team, the enemy and puppets were very frightened, guarded their strongholds in isolation, and did not dare to move out easily.
