　　Jun Gong No. 1 Factory Carefully Studies Methods
　　Garment Quality Gradually Improves
　　[Our Newspaper News] The garment quality of the No. 1 Garment Factory of the Military Region Supply Department is steadily improving. Previously, the colors of the clothes were varied, known as "Bagua Clothes." After careful research, new improvement methods were obtained: 1. The dye and white cloth put into the dyeing vat are weighed and measured to ensure they have the same weight. 2. The tailoring workshop changed from color-matching tailoring to cutting each garment from a single piece of cloth. 3. The machine group marked numbers on the garment pieces, and pieces with the same number were made into one garment. 4. Implementing layer-by-layer inspection: bad cloth is not dyed, badly dyed cloth is not cut, badly cut cloth is not sewn, and badly sewn clothes are not bundled. As a result, the color of the garments gradually became consistent. The workers automatically proposed: "Whose goods, whose name is recorded; whose problem, who repairs it; who makes it badly, who gets their rice deducted." Comrade Liu Laifu from Group 4 said: "We are determined to make military uniforms well, so that the soldiers at the front are satisfied." Through the efforts of all the factory's employees, garment defects have been greatly reduced. In August, ten pieces of clothing and thirty-four pairs of military trousers were scrapped (made badly), while in September, only one pair of military trousers was scrapped. In August, 454 defective upper garments and 309 pairs of military trousers were found during inspection, but in September, this was reduced by 50%. (Ge Qin)
　　[Our Newspaper News] After hearing about the machine workers' groups reducing their capital, the dyeing group of Jun Gong No. 2 Garment Factory also brewed a capital reduction, unanimously passing a resolution to reduce capital by half a jin of rice per hundred square feet of cloth. Based on the current output, the average wage reduction is over 150 jin of rice per person per month. Apprentice Wen Kui proposed: "Although the wages have been reduced, it is still quite a lot. In the past, my family suffered, but now we have turned over. Even if I don't earn wages, I will fight against old Chiang. I am willing to donate 50 jin of rice per month on a long-term basis." Under his leadership, comrades such as Wang Lishen successively proposed long-term donations of 50 jin per month. Other workers were unwilling to lag behind, donating 25 or 30 jin. Donors reached four-fifths of the total number of group members. After the capital reduction, production enthusiasm was even higher, and both quantity and quality improved. In the first phase, each person dyed less than 1,000 square feet per day, but now it has reached 1,200 to 1,300 square feet, and the number of scrapped items has also decreased compared to before.

　　军供一厂细心研究办法
  　衣服质量逐步提高
    【本报讯】军区供给部被服一厂，衣服质量步步提高，以前衣服颜色是五花八门，号称“八卦衣”，经过细心研究，获得新的改造办法：一、染坊下锅的颜料与白布，过称打方尺，使其分量相同。二、裁剪坊由对色裁的办法，改成一件衣服一块布裁成。三、机器组在衣片上划号，一样号打成一件衣服。四、实行层层检查，坏布不染，染坏不裁，裁坏不做，做坏不打捆，结果一件衣服的颜色，逐渐走上一致。工人中自动提出：“谁的货记上谁的名，谁的毛病谁修理，谁做坏扣谁米”。四组刘来福同志说：“决心把军装做好，使前方战士穿上满意”。经过全厂职工同志的努力，衣服毛病大大减少，八月报废（做坏了）衣服十件，军裤三十四条，九月份只报废一条军裤。八月份经检查出有毛病的四百五十四件上装，三百零九条军裤，九月份即减少百分之五十。（葛钦）
    【本报讯】军供被服二厂染布组，听到机工各组减资的消息后，也酝酿减资，一致通过每百方尺布减资半斤米，按现在产量计，平均每人月减工资米一百五十余斤。学徒温魁同志提出：“工资虽然减了，说起来还是不少，过去我家是受罪户，现在翻了身，就是不挣工资亦要打老蒋，我自愿长期献金每月五十斤米。”在他带头下，王立身等同志相继提出长期献金，每月五十斤，其他工友谁也不甘落后，你二十五、我三十，献金者达全组人数五分之四。减资后，生产情绪更加高昂，数质量均有提高，第一期每人每日染不到一千方尺，现已达到一千二、三百方尺，并且报废的数，比以前减少了。（焦风）
