Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Reports from various sources: The governments of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands have recently sent notes to the US and British governments, protesting the "Anglo-American Ruhr Agreement" which "evenly divides" control over the Ruhr coal mines. According to a United Press report on the 2nd, the protest notes from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands were delivered to the US State Department and the British Foreign Office ten days ago. The notes consistently stated that the implementation of the Anglo-American Ruhr plan "may revive German industry, which threatens the security of the three countries, and the three countries cannot but express concern about this." The notes pointed out that the Anglo-American plan effectively "hands over the greatest authority over Ruhr coal production to the Germans," and opposed appointing German managers to manage the coal mines formerly owned by France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The French note said: "German management of Ruhr coal mines will damage France's future position." The Belgian note expressed particular dissatisfaction with the appointment of a German chairman to manage the Ruhr coal mines, while the Dutch note insisted that the Ruhr coal mines must be managed in a decentralized manner. In its note, the Luxembourg government requested that the Anglo-American plan not interfere with the final resolution of international control of the Ruhr. It also emphasized: "Currently, the Allies have to pay Germany's high price for Ruhr coke. This is simply the Allies compensating Germany, not Germany compensating the Allies." The notes suggested convening a conference of countries to renegotiate the Ruhr issue.
