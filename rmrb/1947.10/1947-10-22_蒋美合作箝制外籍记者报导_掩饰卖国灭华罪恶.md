Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Chiang and the U.S. are working together to try to suppress the free reporting of foreign journalists. This is generally considered an attempt by Chiang and the U.S. to cover up their crimes of treachery and national destruction, colluding in a shameful manner. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 17th, citing the "Millard's Review," the Chiang Kai-shek gang "wants to implement a complete censorship system, and the responsible officials have asked the U.S. embassy for U.S. wartime censorship regulations" as a sample for drafting similar regulations. Stuart also recently invited foreign journalists to hold "an almost unbelievable" conversation, advising foreign journalists not to continue writing "critical articles" exposing the Chiang Kai-shek gang. Stuart even asked foreign journalists in the tone of a spokesperson for Chiang Kai-shek: "How do you think the Chinese (Chiang) government can improve its relationship with you?" Even the American-owned "Millard's Review" criticized "an alarming event on the censorship front."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: After strangling freedom of the press in its ruling area, the Chiang Kai-shek gang is attempting to further restore foreign news censorship, obstructing foreign journalists from reporting the true situation in the Chiang-controlled areas. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 13th, foreign journalists in China are wary of the "public criticism and expressions of dissatisfaction" by Chiang Kai-shek's spokesperson Dong Xian Guang and Chiang's officials regarding the reports of certain foreign journalists, believing that "this action may constitute the initial measures of a censorship system." The Foreign Correspondents' Association has prepared to hold a special meeting this week. It is reported that Chen Lifu, the leader of the Chiang clique's CC faction, has written three letters in the past few weeks, shamelessly objecting to foreign journalists calling him a "reactionary" in their reports; and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek also expressed "dissatisfaction" with the fact that some foreign journalists did not describe the Chiang Kai-shek gang's corruption, decay, and crisis in rosy terms.

　　蒋美合作箝制外籍记者报导
  　掩饰卖国灭华罪恶
    【新华社陕北十九日电】蒋美正通力合作企图箝制外籍记者的自由报导，此事被一般认为是蒋美企图掩饰其卖国亡华狼狈为奸的罪恶勾当。据美联社上海十七日电引密勒士评论报消息透露：蒋家匪帮“欲实行全部检查制度，负责官员已向美大使馆索取美国战时检查法规”，作为拟订同样规章的样本。而司徒雷登亦于最近邀请外籍记者，举行了“一次几乎难以令人置信”的谈话会，劝告外籍记者不要继续撰写暴露蒋家匪帮的“批评文章”，司徒甚至以蒋介石代言人口吻询问外籍记者：“你们认为中国（蒋）政府如何才能改善与你们的关系？”对此甚至美商密勒士评论报亦抨击“检查阵线上惊人事件。”
    【新华社陕北十八日电】蒋家匪帮在扼杀其统治区域内新闻自由后，正妄图进一步恢复对外新闻检查，阻挠外籍记者报导蒋管区的真实消息。据美联社沪十三日电透露，驻华外籍记者对于蒋介石代言人董显光及蒋匪官员对某些外籍记者报导的“公开批评与不满意表示”已具戒心，认为“此种行动可能构成检查制度的初步措施。”外籍记者协会为此已准备于周内召开特别会议。据悉蒋党ＣＣ反动派头子陈立夫在过去数周内，曾写了三封信，厚颜无耻的反对外籍记者在报导中称他为“反动派”；而卖国贼蒋介石对某些外籍记者没有把蒋家匪帮的贪污、腐化、危机描写为花团锦簇亦表示“不满意”。
