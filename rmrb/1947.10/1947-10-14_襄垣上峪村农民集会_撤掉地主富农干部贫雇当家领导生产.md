　　Xiangyuan Shangyu Village Farmers' Meeting
  　Remove Landlords, Rich Peasants, and Cadres; Poor and Hired Peasants Take Charge and Lead Production
    [Report from this newspaper in Xiangyuan] On the 27th of last month, due to rainy weather preventing fieldwork, the peasants of Shangyu Village in the First District held a meeting to discuss autumn harvesting and autumn planting. Branch Secretary Wang Tiancai said, "If we want to complete the autumn harvest and planting quickly, we must strengthen leadership. The lack of enthusiasm in our village's production is due to insufficient leadership." He added, "Thinking back to the spring planting, we suffered a lot because we had fewer livestock last autumn, and the land wasn't fully plowed. Out of more than 3,000 mu of autumn land in the village, only one-third was plowed, making it difficult to secure seedlings this spring..." After the discussion, he asked everyone to boldly raise any opinions they had about the leadership or any cadre. Everyone clamored, saying: To quickly complete the autumn harvest and planting, we must have good leaders. Shen Sanyuan (mutual aid team leader) stood up and said, "We can't do without good leaders. If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us, could we have turned ourselves around? Let's speak frankly, Zhang Jinlong is a bankrupt landlord. How can he lead our production well as the production team leader? He doesn't care about us. My opinion is to replace him." All 160 people in the audience said in unison: Replace him, replace him! Wu Jinshan and Chang Weike, two old men, said, "The grain and finance team leader and the logistics personnel are all rich peasants. Can they do a good job for us?" After discussion, everyone unanimously proposed to remove the bad cadres and elected Shen Sanyuan, a liberated peasant, as the production team leader, and Chang Cunfa and other nine poor tenant farmers and hired laborers were elected as cadres. Everyone happily said, "The Communist Party led us to turn ourselves around, and it is truly our own world to sit in." The old man Chang Weike said, "Now that the bad cadres have been overthrown, we must work hard. I think to get the autumn harvest and plowing done early, we should establish a production committee to lead us specifically." Everyone unanimously approved and proposed Branch Secretary Wang Tiancai, Farmers' Association Chairman Zhao Cunfa, and other nine people as the heads of the production committee. They elected one team leader to lead the mutual aid groups. The production committee immediately called on everyone to formulate autumn harvest and plowing plans. If any liberated peasants have difficulties such as wanting to change crops but lacking wheat seeds, plows, or harvesting sickles, they should bring it up and the committee will help coordinate. Everyone discussed and decided to complete the autumn harvest in ten days. The village has 260 livestock, which are suited to 29 plows, with each plow averaging 3.5 mu per day. With 29 plows, 101.5 mu can be plowed each day, and the autumn plowing can be completed in 25 days. The equivalent wage was also determined, and everyone's morale was high. The old man Chang Weike proposed a challenge to Zhang Fuyun's group to complete the plan ahead of schedule. Under his influence, the 21 mutual aid groups challenged and responded to each other, creating an autumn harvest and plowing competition. Significant progress was made in the first three days after the meeting. The production committee lent three dou of wheat seeds to the liberated peasants and military dependents Zhang Jiudan and Wu Jinshan, and coordinated 1.8 shi of replanting wheat seeds for 18 peasant households including Chang Cunfa. They also called on two blacksmiths to make more than 30 harvesting sickles and are currently repairing farm tools (plows). On the 18th and 19th days of the lunar August, they plowed 27 mu of land and harvested 382 mu of grain, corn, and beans, and threshed at three threshing grounds. The old man Wu Jinshan said, "Now that the cadres have been replaced by our own people, look at how energetic we are in harvesting, threshing, and plowing!"

    【本报襄垣讯】一区上峪村，在上月二十七日，因天雨不能下地，农民集会研究秋收秋耕工作，支书王天才说：“要想收耕完成快，非加强领导不行，咱村生产不带劲是领导的不够。”又说：“回想今春下种时，可受了罪啦，原因是去秋牲口少，地没耕完，全村秋地三千多亩，才耕了三分之一，今春就不好捉苗……”谈后提出大家对领导上或那个干部有意见，大胆提出来。大家乱嚷嚷的说：要想很快完成秋收秋耕工作，非得有好领导人不行。申三元（互助组长）站起来说：“没有好领导可不行，咱要不是毛主席来领导，还能翻了身？打破面情说实话吧，张金隆是个破产地主，他当生产组长还能领导好咱们生产？人家就不为咱打算，我的意见换一换他吧。”全场一百六十余人，同声的说：撤换，撤换！武金山、常维科两个老汉说：“财粮组长和后勤都是富农，还能给咱办好个工作？”经讨论，大家一致提出撤换坏干部，选出翻身农民申三元任生产组长，常存法等九个贫佃雇当选了干部，大家高兴的说：“共产党领导咱翻了身，真正是自己的天下自己坐”。常维科老汉说：“将坏干部打下台了，咱们可得好好干哩，我觉着想把秋收耕地早干好，咱成立一个生产委员会，专门领导。”大家一致通过，提出支书王天才、农会主席赵存法等九人，为生产委员会负责人，选出队长一人领导互助小组，生产委员会当即号召大家订秋收耕地计划，如有翻身农民想改茬麦没麦籽、耕地犁、割谷镰等困难，提出来咱委员会帮助调剂。大家讨论订出十天完成秋收，全村牲口二百六十头，合耕地犁二十九张，每张平均每天三亩半，二十九张犁每一天耕一○一．五亩，有二十五天可完成秋耕地。并确定了工资等价，大家情绪很高。常维科老汉提出和张福云组挑战，提前完成计划。二十一个互助组，都在他影响下，互挑互应战，造成秋收耕地竞赛运动。会后三天内工作有显著成绩，生产委员会给翻身农民、军属张九旦、武金山两户，借麦籽三斗，农民常存法等十八户调剂改茬麦籽一石八斗，又叫了铁木匠两个，给打割谷镰三十余张，现正修理农具（耕地犁），阴历八月十八、九两日耕地二十七亩，割谷、玉茭、豆三百八十二亩，打谷三场，武金山老汉说：“干部换成咱这一家人，你看收打、耕地多么有劲哩！”（月则、保忠、自来、法科、玉亭）
