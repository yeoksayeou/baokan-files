Folk Tales, Volume 2
　　Landlords and Laborers
　　Edited by Ma Feng and Xi Rong
    Comrades who have read Folk Tales, Volume 1, "The Skinning Landlord," will surely not forget the landlords' brutality and cunning, and the tenacity and wisdom of the poor peasants. In this volume, there are even more stories of this kind, and they are shorter and easier to read. Telling them to the masses during the review is even better material, and using them as Chinese language lessons in winter schools and primary schools is also good material.

　　民间故事第二集
  　地主和长工
  　马烽、西戎编
    看过民间故事第一集“剥皮老爷”的同志一定忘记不了地主的残暴、狡猾，和贫苦农民的顽强与智慧。这一集里，象这类的故事更多，也更简短易看。在复查中讲给群众听，是更好材料，冬学小学里当作国文课，也是好材料。
