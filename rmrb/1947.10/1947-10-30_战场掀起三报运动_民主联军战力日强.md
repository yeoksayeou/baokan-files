　　Battlefield Launches "Three Reports" Movement
  　Democratic Allied Forces Grow Stronger
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th] Frontline reporters report that in the Battle of Weiyuanbao, a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Forces fought bravely against the enemy, saying: After land reform education and the "speaking bitterness" (诉苦) campaign, the various units of the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces that have been thrown into the autumn offensive have been fighting bravely against the enemy, and heroes have emerged in large numbers. In the Battle of Weiyuanbao, the soldiers of the company that implemented land reform education the best fought especially well, and those who spoke bitterness most profoundly were also the most determined in combat. As a result, they were able to completely annihilate the 116th Division of the Chiang army with a ratio of 1 to 11. The lone hero Li Wenjing single-handedly plunged into the enemy's formation, capturing 41 enemy soldiers, seizing 4 machine guns, and 28 rifles and short guns. When a unit of Chiang bandits at Gaojiadianzi attempted to flee under our fierce artillery fire, combat hero Zhou Hengnong rushed forward like a tiger pouncing on a sheep, scaring the enemy into abandoning their supplies and scattering in all directions. Li Dianzhang, a newly liberated soldier from the summer offensive, excitedly said after the start of the autumn offensive: "The time for revenge has come!" He maneuvered under the enemy's machine gun fire, rushing towards the enemy with a single burst of energy. Taking advantage of the enemy's changing ammunition, he pounced on the enemy, and more than 30 Chiang soldiers were captured by him in no time. When another unit's soldiers began their action, they shouted the "Three Reports" slogan of "Report Revenge, Report Gratitude, Report Good News," wanting to kill more enemies on the battlefield to take revenge on Chiang Kai-shek, repay the Communist Party's kindness, and report good news to their families. The soldiers universally posted their revenge and meritorious service plans on the butts of their guns, on the bodies of their cannons, and on their ammunition boxes. Soldier Liu Chun's plan was: "I want to capture the enemy's heavy machine guns, light machine guns, and 60 mortars, and strive to be a combat hero. I must hang a Chairman Mao medal."
