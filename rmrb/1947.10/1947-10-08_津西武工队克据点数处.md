Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 6th: The People's Armed Work Team of Tianwu County, west of Tianjin, during this "mopping-up" campaign, went deep into the vicinity of the Tian (Tianjin) Sheng (De) Highway near the suburbs of Tianjin, on the side of the Beining Railway. They captured several enemy strongholds, suppressed reactionary landlords, and protected the autumn harvest of the peasants. On September 4th, the Armed Work Team successively captured enemy strongholds such as Hangu Port and Yuquankou in the suburbs of Tianjin. On the 7th, they swiftly surrounded the important enemy strongholds of Zhangjiabao and Chuhe Port. They shouted slogans at the blockhouses and posted slogans all over the villages, scaring the puppet troops so much that they did not dare to leave the blockhouses to seize grain for four days, protecting the autumn harvest of the masses in more than ten villages such as Wangjiabao and Chenjiabao nearby. Bi Tingyuan, a reactionary landlord in a village three miles away from the Beining Railway, forced the masses to organize a puppet regiment. Our Armed Work Team immediately entered the village, shot and killed the reactionary landlord, and captured a large puppet township chief. On the morning of the 8th, the Armed Work Team took advantage of the victory to recover Xinzhuang, only ten miles away from Shengfang, protecting the autumn harvest of the masses in seven villages such as Shenjiakou and Dingjiawu, and harvesting twelve qing of autumn fields in one day and one night. In seven days, our Armed Work Team traveled all over more than forty villages. Wherever they went, the enemy and puppets were frightened, and the morale of the people was boosted.
