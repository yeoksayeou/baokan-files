　　Stone Nose Land Reform is Far From Good
  　Party Members Harbor Landlords, Poor and Hired Peasants Not Liberated
    [This newspaper, Wu Xiang dispatch] A recent inspection in Stone Nose Village, Wu Xiang Fifth District, revealed that farmers were not thoroughly liberated. Landlords still maintained the same attitude as when farmers did not own land. The wife of a former landlord said to the farmers, "You won't hold onto the fruits of your labor for long." Feudal rich peasants still owned an average of more than five mu and one fen of land per person, living much better than poor peasants. For example, the rich peasant Wang Liu-zhong, with a family of three, harvested three shi of wheat, while the poor peasant Wang San-tu, with a family of three, only harvested six dou of wheat. Wang Hai-jin said they had padded quilts in the cold and could wear single layers when it was warm, with complete bedding, while some farmers had to share a quilt between two people and lacked both food and clothing. Because class distinctions were not clearly drawn in the past, this time another ten households of escaped feudal elements were found, some of whom had even received fruits of land reform. The masses called these people "getting the best of both worlds; eating from three pots." The reason for the incomplete struggle was the failure to fully mobilize the masses. Out of the village's one hundred and twenty poor and hired peasant households, fifty-eight were not liberated. Party members not only failed to play a promoting role but some even harbored landlords. In the last struggle, the branch committee had decided not to leave wheat land for the landlords, but the Party members in the village told the farmers to leave land for the landlords. In addition, there were many other problems, which will be thoroughly resolved in the major re-examination. (Bu Ao)
    [This newspaper, Ping Ding dispatch] The Town Gate held a meeting of liberation team leaders on the 20th to inspect liberation efforts. It was found that insufficient attention had been paid to the elderly and those who were not good at speaking. The movement seemed to be booming, but it was only focused on existing activists, and the poorest peasants, who had been most oppressed in the past, dared not speak. Qi Lin from East Gate Street said in a personal conversation that he was clumsy with words and afraid of being contradicted if he spoke incorrectly. He could speak when several people were together, but he dared not open his mouth in a large meeting. Also, Zhang Tian-yi and Liu Tao-zhu from Jiang Jia-gou in East Gate, among others, did not often speak during the movement because they still had ideological concerns. Hu Yan, an old man from West Gate, used to rent land from landlords and still said that he was very grateful to them in the past, otherwise he would not have survived. However, after accounting and explanation, he immediately became aware. In the ideological investigation in the Cross Street of Upper Town West Gate, it was found that the peasants felt pity for the landlords. When they saw the landlords doing physical labor, they remembered that they had once exploited them, and they immediately became aware. In addition, there were still many people who had not been mobilized in this way. After such reports, the cadres were greatly shocked and decided to change their style and deeply mobilize the silent poor people.

　　石鼻土改差得很远
  　党员包庇地主贫雇没有翻身
    【本报武乡讯】武乡五区石鼻村最近检查中透，农民没彻底翻身，地主态度仍和农民没有土地时一样，曾是地主的女人对农民说：“你们拿上果实不久长。”封建富农则每人平均仍有五亩一分多地，生活比贫农好的多。如富农王留中，三口人收麦三石，而贫农王三秃，三口人才收麦六斗。王海金则述说袷就袷，该单穿单，被褥齐全；而农民却有的二人伙盖一条被子，吃穿都缺。由于过去阶级没划清，这次又查出十户漏网封建，其中还有得过果实的，群众叫这号人是“两头赶上；三头吃开。”斗争不彻底的原因，主要是没有充分发动群众，全村一百二十户贫雇，就有五十八户没翻了身，党员不仅不能起推动作用，反而有些党员互相包庇地主，上次斗争中，本来支部会决定不给地主留麦地，而该村党员却叫农民给地主留了，此外也存在着很多问题，结果待到大复查中予以彻底解决的。（步鳌）
    【本报平定讯】城关廿日召开翻身组长会议，检查翻身，发现过去对老年人及不会说的人重视不足。看起来运动似乎轰轰烈烈，但仅停在现有积极分子身上，过去受压迫最甚的贫苦农民不敢说话。东门街齐林在个别谈话中说：自己嘴笨，怕说差了别人顶回来，几个人在一块还能说，一到大会就不敢开口了。又如东关姜家沟张天义、刘逃珠等因为思想上还有顾虑，在运动中便常不发言。西关胡彦老汉，过去租佃地主土地，直到现在还说过去多亏人家，不是就活不成。但一经算帐解说，亦立即觉悟起来。上城西关十字街在查思想中，发现农民对地主可怜，看到地主下力劳动，就又想起他们曾经剥削我们，马上觉悟起来。另外，象这些未经发动的人还很多，经这样的汇报，各干部大吃一惊，决改变作风，深入发动不吭气的贫苦人。
