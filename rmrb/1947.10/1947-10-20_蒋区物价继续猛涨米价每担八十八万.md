　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th—The vicious inflation in the KMT-controlled areas is now intensifying, with the U.S. dollar, stocks, and all commodities soaring to new peaks. According to reports from various sources, as of the 13th, the black market price of the U.S. dollar in Shanghai had reached approximately 91,000 yuan, and the market price of gold was as high as 5.3 million yuan per tael. The price of rice has risen to 880,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg), the price of meat has risen by 45% in three days, the price of coal is 5 million yuan per ton, and cotton textiles have also soared. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 13th, the average price of daily necessities rose by more than 30% from the 11th to the 13th. The Shanghai economic observers cited by the AP reported that if 1936 is taken as the base year, the price of rice has now increased 80,000 times, cotton textiles have increased 100,000 times, and other imported goods and the stock market have also risen simultaneously. The price of kerosene rose by 50% by the 12th compared to before. This wave of price increases has spread to major cities in the KMT-controlled areas. In Changsha, a famous rice-producing area, the price of rice broke through the 310,000 yuan per dan mark on the 12th. Rice and other commodities in Guilin have also skyrocketed. Commodity prices in Shenyang have risen continuously in the past two weeks, and grain prices have doubled overnight recently, and have reached a point where there is no market even with the high prices. The high price of grain has left the better restaurants in the city empty all day long. The current situation shows that the economy in the KMT-controlled areas is on the verge of collapse, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities are in a state of panic. Wu Guozhen, the KMT mayor of Shanghai, has issued a lament that "the soaring price of grain will cause unrest." The Associated Press pointed out that the KMT army's defeat on the Manchurian battlefield and the decline in export trade are the main factors contributing to the current market chaos. While the American warmonger Bullitt and the U.S. Congressional delegation are loudly calling for massive aid to Chiang Kai-shek, they have no impact on the current soaring prices.

　　蒋区物价继续猛涨米价每担八十八万
    【新华社陕北十五日电】蒋管区恶性的物价涨风，现更变本加厉，美钞、股票及一切商品均涨达新的高峰。据各方报导：至十三日止，上海美钞黑市价格已高达九万一千元左右，黄金市价每两高达五百卅万元。米价上涨至每担八十八万元，肉价已在三天内上涨百分之四十五，煤每吨价格五百万元，棉纺织品也猛涨。据美联社上海十三日电报导，日用必需品价格至十三日比十一日平均上涨百分之三十以上。而该社所引上海经济观察家之统计，米价若以一九三六年为基数，现已增高八万倍，棉纺织品则增高十万倍，其他进口货、股票市场亦均同时上涨。煤油价格至十二日较前上升百分之五十。此一涨风已扩及蒋管区各大城市。著名产米区的长沙，十二日米价已突破每担三十一万元大关。桂林米及各物亦均暴涨不已。沈阳物价近两周来连续上涨，粮价于最近一夜之间暴涨一倍，且已到了有价无市之境，粮价高昂已使市上较好之饭店整日空无人影。目前情况说明蒋管区经济已摇摇欲坠，蒋匪当局恐慌万状，上海蒋记市长吴国桢又发出“谷物价格暴涨，将要引起骚动”的哀鸣。美联社指出：满洲战场蒋军的失利，及出口贸易的衰退，是目前市场混乱的主要因素。而美国战争贩子布立特及美国会考察团虽在大声叫嚣给蒋介石大量援助，但对目前的物价暴涨却毫无影响。
