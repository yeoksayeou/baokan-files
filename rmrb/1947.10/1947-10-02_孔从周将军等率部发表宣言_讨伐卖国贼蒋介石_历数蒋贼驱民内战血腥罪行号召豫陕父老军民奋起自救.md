Xinhua News Agency, Yuxi Front, 30th - General Kong Congzhou, commander of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army, and other generals, have recently led all officers and soldiers in issuing a declaration denouncing the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. The original text is as follows:

　　Our 38th Army was originally under the command of General Yang Hucheng, a general from the Northwest. Previously, we opposed Chiang Kai-shek's pro-Japanese and traitorous policies, and his persecution of the people. We followed Zhang and Yang in launching the "Double Twelve" Incident twice, aiming to save the nation and ensure survival by jointly resisting foreign aggression. Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek flew back to Nanjing, broke his promises, and relapsed into his old ways. After "July 7th," Chiang Kai-shek was forced to hang up the banner of resistance against Japan, but in reality, he communicated with enemy envoys, prioritizing selling out the country and opposing the Communists over resisting Japan; his intentions to eliminate dissidents were sinister. Although our army was under Chiang Kai-shek's discrimination and annexation, we still upheld our original intention of saving the country and served on the battlefield; we defended Niangziguan, fought bravely at Xuehua Mountain, and repelled the enemy's thirteen "sweeps" in southern Shanxi. We fought fiercely for nineteen days and nights at Hulao, and fought in the three provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan. Chiang Kai-shek provided neither a single soldier in aid nor a single bullet in supply, but instead further divided our army, sending special agents, appointing chief officers, and carrying out layoffs, reorganizations, and annexations. Generals Zhang and Yang are still in prison, and General Zhao Shoushan was deprived of his military power. The reorganized officers and soldiers either became idlers or were assassinated; the list goes on. What is even more painful is that, regardless of the pressing enemy situation, we were forced to attack the Eighth Route Army in western Henan. The entire army could no longer tolerate this and resolutely refused the counter-Communist order, breaking free from the cage. We successively launched anti-civil war uprisings in Luoning, Gongxian, and Huixian.

　　Under the heroic persistence of the people and soldiers of the whole country, the War of Resistance was finally won. Chiang Kai-shek was obsessed with dictatorship and intended to steal the fruits of the War of Resistance. Disregarding the wishes of the vast majority of the people, and relying on the help of the American reactionaries, he launched a full-scale civil war. In one year, the invading bandit troops were annihilated by 1.2 million by the military and civilians of the liberated areas. Due to popular opposition, weakened military strength, and an empty rear, the defeat was already determined. Chiang Kai-shek was obsessed and did a desperate struggle, recognizing the thief as the father and letting the wolf into the house externally; internally, he arbitrarily exploited the people, placing them in dire straits. Under Chiang Kai-shek's bloody rule, the people of Henan and Shaanxi suffered from exorbitant grain levies and miscellaneous taxes. Last year, Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan collected a total of six million dan of grain in Shaanxi. Over the years, six to seven million people in Henan have died from the four major disasters of "water, drought, locusts, and Tang Enbo." The conscription and capture of men were even more appalling. This spring, Henan province alone sent 107,000 conscripts, who were captured and bound like criminals. Those without men paid for substitutes, with each man costing as much as ten million, resulting in nine out of ten households being empty and refugees everywhere. The fertile fields of Henan and Shaanxi have now become hell on earth, with young and middle-aged people wandering in foreign lands, and the old and weak lying dead in the wilderness. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have brothers? This kind of misery is outrageous!

　　Since our army's uprising, we have been deeply valued by the Communist Party of China, welcomed by the liberated peasants everywhere, and cared for by the democratic government. In the two years of the patriotic self-defense war, we fought alongside the People's Liberation Army, intimately like brothers, and constantly received its help and support, firmly establishing the will to serve the people. The troops have expanded four times, the equipment has been greatly strengthened, and the combat effectiveness has been rapidly improved, becoming a strong people's army. At this moment of a full-scale counter-offensive, our Liberation Army, starting from the sea in the east and ending in Shaanxi and Gansu in the west, is waving its spears southward, directly attacking Chiang Kai-shek's heart. It is invincible and unstoppable. Our army is extremely concerned about the people of Henan and Shaanxi and has an unshirkable responsibility to relieve their suffering. Therefore, we are reorganizing the army and taking an oath, crossing the Yellow River, and marching into Henan and Shaanxi, vowing to punish the two traitors, Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, in order to liberate the Central Plains and the Northwest, help the people to stand up, implement land reform, develop national industry and commerce, and abolish conscription, grain levies, and exorbitant taxes. All the elders in Henan and Shaanxi, and our brother soldiers, are urged to join hands with our army to rise up and save ourselves, and jointly overthrow the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's fascist tyranny; and we hope that all patriotic soldiers will distinguish between friends and enemies, make decisive decisions, break away from Chiang Kai-shek's cage, and no longer be tools for traitors. The Chiang family officers and soldiers in various places should immediately repent, atone for their sins to the people, immediately withdraw from the civil war inferno, and not be eternal sinners of the country.

　　Fellow elders and brothers from all walks of life, mobilize together, assist the Liberation Army in punishing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang! Down with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek! Completely overthrow the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan! Establish a people's coalition government! Realize a democratic, independent, and happy New China!

　　Commander Kong Congzhou, Political Commissar Wang Feng, Deputy Commander Liu Weicheng, Chen Xianrui, leading all officers and soldiers. September 9th

　　孔从周将军等率部发表宣言
  　讨伐卖国贼蒋介石
  　历数蒋贼驱民内战血腥罪行号召豫陕父老军民奋起自救
    【新华社豫西前线三十日电】西北民主联军第三十八军军长孔从周等将军，顷率全体指战员发表讨伐卖国贼蒋介石宣言，原文如下：
    我三十八军本系西北将领杨虎城将军部属，前因反对蒋介石媚日卖国，残害人民，曾随张杨两次发动“双十二”兵谏，志在救亡图存，共御外侮。不意蒋贼飞返南京，自食诺言，故态复萌。“七七”以后，蒋贼被迫挂起抗战招牌，实则与敌信使往来，卖国反共重于抗战；消灭异己，居心叵测。本军虽处蒋贼歧视并吞之下。仍本救国初衷，效命疆场；坚守娘子关，奋战雪花山，晋南打退敌人十三次“扫荡”，虎牢苦战十九昼夜，转战晋冀豫三省，蒋贼既无一兵之援，又无一弹之补，反更分化本军，派特务，委主官，裁员，编遣，并吞。张杨二公还在监里，赵公寿山被夺军权。编遣官兵或作寓公，或遭暗算，不胜枚举。更可痛者，且竟不顾大敌压境，逼令进攻豫西八路军。全军忍无可忍，毅然拒绝反共乱命，脱离囚笼。先后于洛宁、巩县、辉县举行反内战起义。
    在全国军民英勇坚持下，抗战终获胜利。蒋贼醉心独裁，意欲窃取抗战果实。不顾广大人民意愿，凭借美国反动派之助，发动全面内战。一年之间，经解放区军民迎头痛击，损兵折将，进犯匪军被歼达百二十万。其因人民反对，兵力削弱，后方空虚，败局已定。蒋贼执迷不悟，犹图作绝望挣扎，外则认贼作父，引狼入室；内则恣意苛榨，置人民于倒悬。我豫陕人民在蒋贼血腥统治下，粮款苛杂，交相煎逼。去年蒋胡在陕征粮共达六百万石。河南人民历年死于“水、旱、蝗、汤”四大灾祸者六七百万。征兵抓丁，更属骇人听闻。今春河南一省，即派壮丁十万七千名，捕捉绑捆，如同罪犯。无丁者出款购买，每丁价达千万，致使人民十室九空，遍地灾黎。豫陕沃野千里，今已尽成人间地狱，青壮流离异乡，老弱陈尸野外，谁无父母？谁无兄弟？此种惨情能不令人发指！
    本军起义以来，深得中共器重，翻身农民到处欢迎，民主政府爱护备至。两年来爱国自卫战争中，与解放军并肩作战，亲密如同手足，不断得其帮助扶植，坚树为人民服务意志。部队扩大四倍，装备大为加强，战斗力迅速提高，已成坚强的人民劲旅。斯值全面反攻之际，我解放军东起大海，西迄陕甘，挥戈南指，直捣蒋贼胸腹。所向披靡，势如破竹。本军对我豫陕父老，向极关怀，解除人民痛苦，责无旁贷。是以整军誓师，横渡黄河，出师豫陕，誓讨蒋胡二贼，以期解放中原与西北，帮助人民翻身，实行土地改革，发展民族工商事业，废除征丁征粮苛捐杂税。凡我豫陕父老，先进袍泽，望与本军密切携起手来，奋起自救，共同打倒卖国贼蒋介石，推翻蒋介石法西斯暴政；并望一切爱国军人，辨清敌友，当机立断，脱离蒋贼牢笼，勿再为卖国贼作工具。各地蒋家官兵，应即翻然悔悟，向人民赎罪，立即退出内战火坑，勿作国家千古罪人。
    各界父老兄弟们，一致动员起来，援助解放大军讨伐蒋家匪帮！打倒卖国贼蒋介石！彻底推翻蒋胡黑暗统治！建立人民的联合政府！实现民主、独立、幸福的新中国！
    军长孔从周、政治委员汪锋、副军长刘威诚、陈先瑞率全体指战员。九月九日
