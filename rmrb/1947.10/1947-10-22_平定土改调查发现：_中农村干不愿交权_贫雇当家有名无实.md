　　Pingding Land Reform Investigation Reveals:
  　Middle Peasants and Rich Peasants Unwilling to Relinquish Power
  　Poor and Hired Peasants' Leadership Exists in Name Only
    [Report from our newspaper in Pingding] In order to lay the foundation for the major re-examination after the autumn harvest, the County Party Committee organized more than 20 cadres to conduct land reform investigations in advanced, general, backward areas, and the Chengguan Shizi Street area. The main problem discovered in the new and old areas during the movement is that poor and hired peasants lack the backbone to take the stage, and the real power holders are still those who are eloquent and of middle peasant composition. Although they are not the main cadres, it is true that these people still have the final say. For example, in Weichi Village, Fifth District, there are ten main cadres in the entire village. From a composition point of view, there are three extremely poor peasants, four poor peasants, one middle peasant, one rich middle peasant, and one feudal rich peasant. In terms of quantity, poor and hired peasants account for 70%, but the real power holders and those who have the final say in the village are definitely not poor and hired peasants. Therefore, poor and hired peasants only hold the name, and still lack backbone in their work. The Ninth District is an old area. According to an investigation of the Hongshui cadres, it is still a problem whether pure poor and hired peasants truly hold power. The person in power in the village is the village chief, who, from his composition, is a lower-middle peasant, but has historically been dishonest, decadent, and inextricably linked to the landlord class, while the political director is a very honest person and cannot really manage affairs. Because poor and hired peasants have just taken the stage, the masses in Shizi Street still look down on them. For example, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, Wu Jixiang, is an honest peasant who is not good at speaking. Whenever he arrives at a meeting, some eloquent people laugh at him, so he dares not say much at the meeting. With the firm support and backing of our district cadres, poor and hired peasants have initially established their prestige, and honest peasants have gained momentum. In the future, we must continue to mobilize the entire poor and hired peasant stratum from the bottom up to give greater play to the power of poor and hired peasants. (Xiaoyun, Shengrong, Xiufeng, Jiyuan, Tingdong)
    [Report from our newspaper in Southern Hebei, 20th] The Third District of Jize is preparing for a major re-examination and is conducting a base point investigation in Dongqiaoxia. District cadres jumped out of the circle of village cadres and personally visited poor peasants, using casual conversation to understand the situation of the poor peasants' emancipation. Initially asked: "Have you been emancipated?" The masses sighed and said, "We have been emancipated!" or said, "Saying we are emancipated means we are emancipated; saying we are not emancipated means we are not emancipated." Or said: "In terms of the number of land plots, we have more than landlords, but they are all bad land. If we say we are not emancipated, we are afraid that the village cadres will not be able to do it." When asked about good and bad land, they said: "We poor people have no ability, how can we divide good land? Village cadres and dependents of revolutionary martyrs can all want it, and they can want more." Later, the cadres personally went to the homes of hired and poor peasants to see that there were still eleven poor peasant families who had no houses to live in. Wang Yintang only had two small adobe bungalows, and the beams and rafters for building the house were borrowed from others, and he still owes debts to this day. Even the water tank and bellows are borrowed. Zhang Xiang also has no house to live in, and the cotton quilt is like a piece of sackcloth. The masses are very dissatisfied with the village cadres taking too much of the fruits of victory. For example, some said: "Village cadre ×× is also an emancipated household, and I am also an emancipated household. I only received a small share of the fruits of victory, but he now has five sacks of wheat. What else can you call it but corruption?" "When village cadre ×× struggled against landlord Pang Shaoxian, he didn't let us go to the landlord's house, but told us to wait at the door. The village cadre went to the landlord's house, marked a few things with white chalk, and didn't let us carry the things that weren't marked with white chalk. It's not worth struggling against him at all. When struggling against landlord Liu Erwen, he even had the landlord's children stand guard with guns as militiamen, and he didn't let us in. The village cadre treats the landlord better than the poor." When asked about the struggle, the masses said angrily: "The village cadres are full, and struggling against them has no benefit for them, so what is there to struggle about." Finally, we explained to the masses: In the future, the poor people will be in charge. Because the village cadres in the past were undemocratic and suppressed the masses, the masses are very suspicious and say: "Is the Eighth Route Army asking the poor to be in charge, or is it asking the village cadres to be in charge?" After careful explanation, the poor peasants said: "If the poor are in charge, what is there to be afraid of?"

　　平定土改调查发现：
  　中农村干不愿交权
  　贫雇当家有名无实
    【本报平定讯】为了打下秋后大复查的基础，县委组织了二十余个干部，作了先进。一般、落后及城关十字街的土改调查，发现在新老区运动的主要问题是贫雇上台腰不硬，真正当权的还是能说会道和中农成份的，他们虽不是主要干部，但说话顶事的确仍是这些人。如五区苇池全村主要干部共十个，从成份来看赤贫三个、贫农四个、中农一个、富裕中农一个、封建富农一个，在数量上贫雇占百分之七十，但该村当权的、说话顶事的，确不是贫雇。因此贫雇就是光顶了一个名，工作中仍腰不硬。九区是一个老区，据调查洪水干部中，真正纯正贫雇掌权仍是个问题，该村当权的是村长一人，从他成份上来看是个下中农，但历史上一贯不正派，流氓腐化和地主阶级割不断联系，而政治主任是个很老实的人，确主不了事。十字街干部由于贫雇初上台，群众还有看不起贫雇的现象，如农会主席吴计祥是个老实农民，不会说话，一到会场，一些能说会道的人就笑他，因此大会上他就不敢多说，在我区干部坚决扶持和撑腰下，贫雇才初步建立了威信，老实农民才有了劲。今后仍须自下而上的发动整个贫雇层，才能更大的发挥贫雇的力量。（效云、生荣、秀峰、计元、庭栋）
    【本报冀南二十日电】鸡泽三区准备大复查，在东桥下进行基点调查。区干跳出村干圈子，亲访贫农，用闲扯的方式，了解贫农翻身情形。初问：“你们翻了身了没有？”群众叹气的说：“翻身了！”或说：“说翻身就是翻身，说没翻身就是没翻身。”又说：“从地亩数上说比地主还多，可是都是坏地。我们要说没翻身吧，还怕村干不行呢。”问到他们好坏地时，则说：“咱穷人又没能耐，还能分好地吗？村干呀、抗属呀，都能要，还能多要。”后来干部亲到雇贫家去看，还有十一户贫农现在还没房子住。王印堂只两间小土平房，盖房屋梁椽木头都是借人家的，到现在还欠着债，连水缸风箱都是借的。张祥的也同样没房住，棉被子好象布袋片。群众对村干多占果实，甚为不满，如有的说：“××村干他也是翻身户，我也是翻身户，我只分了不多点果实，人家如今还有五布袋麦子呢。你说不是贪污是啥？”“××村干在斗争地主庞绍先时，不叫俺往地主家去，叫俺在门上等着，村干到地主家，将几样东西划上白道，不划白道的都不叫抬，划的又是不值钱的东西，还不如不斗争人家哩。斗争地主刘二文时，还叫人家的孩子当着民兵，拿着枪站着岗，又是不叫俺进门，村干对地主比对穷人心眼还近哩。”问到斗争的事，群众愤愤的说：“村干吃饱了，再斗争对他们说没啥利益了，还斗啥。”最后我们又向群众说明：今后穷人要当家，由于过去村干不民主，压制群众，群众很怀疑的说：“八路军是叫穷人当家。还是叫村干当家。”经细心的解释，贫农说：“穷人当家，还怕啥呢？”
