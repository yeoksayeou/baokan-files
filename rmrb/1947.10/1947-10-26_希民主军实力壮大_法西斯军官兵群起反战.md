　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 23rd: Athens dispatch: Under the armed intervention of the US and Britain and the brutal terrorist policies of the Greek fascist government, the Greek Democratic Army is growing stronger day by day. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 14th, the strength of the Democratic Army led by General Markos is currently estimated at 135,000 to 170,000. The dispatch also revealed that the United States has to spend $158 million this year to support the Greek reactionary government's army in its war against the Democratic Army. Recently, the Greek fascist army has been shocked by the Democratic Army's offensive, and the anti-war sentiment of officers and soldiers is increasing day by day. According to a TASS dispatch on the 19th, the deceived government army officers and soldiers are gradually realizing that their bloody struggle is only against their own compatriots, and they are unwilling to point their guns at their own people. It often happens that officers personally lead entire detachments to refuse to attack the Democratic Army. The Greek fascist government is very panicked by this and has taken bloody measures to try to suppress it. In recent months, 15,000 anti-war officers and soldiers have been exiled to barren islands. Military courts have sentenced dozens of anti-war officers and soldiers to death. According to Agence France-Presse: seventeen members of the "defeatist group" in the Greek parliament were sentenced to death on the 20th.

　　希民主军实力壮大
  　法西斯军官兵群起反战
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】雅典讯：在美英武装干涉与希腊法西斯政府的残暴恐布政策下，希民主军却正日益壮大中。据美联社十四日电估计：马科斯将军所领导的民主军实力，目前为十三万五千至十七万人。该电并透露：美国为支持希反动政府军对民主军作战，本年度不得不耗费一亿五千八百万美元。最近希法西斯军队为民主军攻势所震摄，官兵反战情绪日益高涨。据塔斯社十九日讯，被欺骗的政府军官兵，逐渐认识到他们的流血斗争仅是反对他们自己的同胞，而不愿将枪口对准自己人，经常发生军官亲自率领整个支队拒绝进攻民主军之事。希法西斯政府对此甚为惊慌，已采取血腥手段以图镇压。最近数月内，便有一万五千反战官兵被放逐到荒岛上。军事法庭判处反战官兵死刑的案件，就有数十件之多。另据法新社讯：希国会中“失败主义集团”十七名议员于二十日被判处死刑。
