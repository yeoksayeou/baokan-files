　　Poor Harvest This Autumn
　　Preparing to Compensate with Textiles
　　[Our Newspaper Gaoyi News] In order to launch a hundred-day winter textile campaign to overcome the famine, the county production committee held a meeting to study this work, and instructed all districts to vigorously organize and carry out this movement. It was explained that if organized to carry out textile work, it would be enough to solve the food problem for all the disaster victims in the county (10,000 disaster victims in the county). The Second District put forward the slogan "If you want to get rich, weave more cloth; if you want to prosper, spin more cotton" in mobilizing the hundred-day textile campaign. In order to improve the mood of the spinners and take care of the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, a 20/80 profit-sharing system was stipulated, and organizational forms such as the combination of mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law were also stipulated. Now 1,433 spinners and 444 looms in the district have begun to operate, weaving cloth during the day and spinning cotton at night, saving two taels of oil every night by not lighting lamps. Villages competed with villages, and groups with groups in the hundred-day textile competition. At the Fourth District meeting, the Cheng Zhao Cooperative's method of supporting women's spinning was considered good, helping women buy raw materials and sell finished products, and extracting cotton gins and wind bows to gin and card cotton for the spinners. Carpenters and workers were also called to make spinning wheels and looms to solve the tool shortage, lending them to the spinners at a quarter lower than the market price. The Nan Jiao Cooperative collected yarn and sold it at the Zan Huang market. In order to encourage everyone to spin good yarn, it was stipulated that one catty of good yarn would be rewarded with two taels of cotton. They influenced the cooperatives in the whole district that could not serve the masses, and they also underwent transformation. For example, the Xi Liang Zhuang Cooperative used to sell vinegar and soy sauce, but now it has stopped its business and bought cotton gins and wind bows to serve the spinners and solve their difficulties. On the 27th of last month, Bei Jiao convened a meeting of more than 40 weavers in the village to study the weaving problem. After mobilization, everyone was determined to weave well throughout the winter, striving for the whole village not to buy cloth for seasonal changes. After completing the seasonal change task, they will start weaving cloth for sale. The profit-sharing problem between old and new weavers, and the profit-sharing problem between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law were also studied. Finally, thirteen voluntary combination groups were formed. It was also studied that there would be a shortage of firewood this winter, so weaving in the underground cellar would be neither cold nor safe, and it was decided to build underground cellars so that women could weave with peace of mind. After the meeting, the male cadres were very enthusiastic. Village Chief Liu Wenzhi, Public Security Officer Cui Zhanyuan and other five people were determined to build five underground cellars and mobilized their own women to organize and start working first. Li Chunying, chairman of the Women's Federation, and Liu Fujie, vice chairman, were also determined to lead a group combining spinning and weaving, and to promote spinning and weaving in the whole village. Now they are starting to build underground cellars, and women are also rectifying their organization. The textile cooperative plans to add livestock and draw funds to buy cotton to support the spinning groups.

　　[Our Newspaper Ji'nan 28th Dispatch] Women in Dongjiezhuang, Seventh District of Yuan Dynasty, benefited from spinning cotton, equivalent to increasing grain production by ten catties per mu. The village has 131 households, with 163 spinning wheels and 42 looms. Last year, a total of 12,874 feet of cloth were woven and 11,004 feet of cloth were worn. Thirty-seven households sold 2,320 feet of cloth, and the remaining 91 households were completely self-sufficient. From the beginning of the first month to the eighth month of this year, the whole village wove a total of 10,516 feet (net two-foot yard, including 1,100 feet of military cloth), wore 1,008 feet of cloth (including one household buying 10 feet of cloth), and 49 households sold 5,218 feet of cloth, at 200 yuan per foot, for a total of 1,043,600 yuan. At 50 yuan per catty of corn, it can buy 20,872 catties. The whole village has 2,075 mu of cultivated land, and the women's spinning and weaving and selling cloth to buy grain alone can increase grain production by more than ten catties per mu. For example, Zhang Ying, a member of the Women's Federation, spun one and a half catties of yarn from five catties of seed cotton, wove 25 feet of cloth as capital to sell cloth and exchange for yarn. Now she has woven a total of 410 feet of cloth, earning a net profit of 84,000 yuan. Zhao Mingxue's wife wove 835 feet of cloth in eight months, earning more than 100,000 yuan.
