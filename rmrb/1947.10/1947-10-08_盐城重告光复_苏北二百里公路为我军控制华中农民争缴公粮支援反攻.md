Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: In Yancheng (Ye Ting), Northern Jiangsu, Chiang Kai-shek's troops, fearing a sudden strike by the People's Liberation Army, abandoned the city and fled south to Dongtai on the 1st of this month, and the city was thus recovered. The 200-li section of the Tong (Nantong)-Yu (Ganyu) Highway from Liuzhuang north to Funing south is again under the control of the People's Liberation Army. After the People's Liberation Army captured Yeting City in mid-August and completed its mission of annihilating the enemy, it took the initiative to withdraw. On the 23rd, Chiang's army reoccupied the city, first stationing the 59th and 102nd Brigades of the Reorganized 4th Division, and later the 11th Regiment of the 21st Division, which had just been transported from Taiwan to northern Jiangsu. The regiment was trapped in the isolated city for only a month before it had to abandon the city and flee.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: Liberated peasants in various parts of central and northern Jiangsu are actively paying autumn public grain to replenish the strength of the great counter-offensive. In Zishi New County, Hai'an and other places in central Jiangsu, a public grain delivery competition has been launched, and a 1,700-person transportation team has been organized to specifically transport it. A certain military family in the old dike area of Xinghua voluntarily upgraded their B-grade field to A-grade to pay more public grain. In Ru(gao)Baolin Township, more than 20 poor and hired peasants who had been liberated upgraded their field grades to pay public grain. After storing the public grain, the masses in Tianping District, Baoying, excitedly said, "The grain and grass are stored, just waiting for the arrival of the counter-offensive army!" In the Huaihai District of northern Jiangsu and Funing East and other counties, which had suffered from Chiang's bandits, floods, and droughts, many peasants still voluntarily paid public grain even though the democratic government had clearly ordered reductions and exemptions. In the border areas, under the cover of local armed forces and militia, the masses also rushed to pay and transport grain day and night. Liu Bingzhang, a mine-laying hero in Zishi, blocked Hu Jiaji and other strongholds with landmines to cover the grain delivery of people from the border villages. Some sailed ships around enemy bunkers and checkpoints to deliver the grain to the grain storage stations. The masses in the Chiang-occupied areas eagerly awaited the great counter-offensive, and disguised themselves to go to the market or crossed the enemy's blockade line early in the morning or late at night to deliver public grain to the liberated areas. The masses who were driven away by Chiang's bandits scattered the grain on the ground, saying, "I would rather spoil it than let you dogs eat it!" When Ma Zhang from near the Xu Liu Chiang stronghold (now recovered) went to the liberated area to deliver public grain, she burst into tears when she saw the cadres, telling the tragic story of Chiang's army burying her husband alive, saying, "I don't want to be exempted from payment. Feed the troops well so that the great counter-offensive can avenge my man!"

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: Central Jiangsu has recently discovered the heinous crimes of feudal despots and traitors who secretly murdered democratic cadres and sabotaged the land reform review. Tao Aitang, a traitorous despot from Taojiazhuang Village in Qintong (formerly a town, now a county), whose son joined Chiang Kai-shek's "Homecoming Corps" in Dongtai, fearing that the masses would settle accounts with him, colluded with his cronies Tao Yuetang, Zhang Changhao, and others to trick Xie Xuegui, the village self-defense captain, to the river bank by despicable means, strangled him to death with a rope, and loaded the body into the river, tying it with a large stone and sinking it to the bottom of the river in an attempt to cover up the crime. After this case occurred, it aroused the serious attention of the county public security bureau of the democratic government, which immediately sent personnel to investigate everywhere, and finally the truth came to light, and the three criminals were arrested and handed over to the masses for public trial and execution. When Zhu Zhenyu, a liberated peasant in Shihong Township, Taibei County, was leading the struggle against the evil bully Wang Zemin, he encountered two humanoid and beast-faced monsters on his way home at night, who rushed towards him and tried to put a rope around Zhu's neck and tie him up. Zhu resisted and cried for help, and nearby residents came when they heard the noise. The Chiang Kai-shek special agents in disguise were frightened and fled in panic, and Zhu was rescued. The next day, the family members of Wang Zemin, the traitor who masterminded the case, were all arrested after being reported by the masses. Two similar cases also occurred in the Tidong District of the county, which is worthy of vigilance everywhere. The leading organs in various places have now widely educated the masses about such incidents and strengthened mass-based anti-espionage and defense work.

　　盐城重告光复
  　苏北二百里公路为我军控制华中农民争缴公粮支援反攻
    【新华社华中六日电】苏北叶挺（盐城）蒋匪慑于解放军随时可以到来的突然打击，本月一日弃城南窜东台，该城遂重告收复。通（南通）榆（赣榆）公路刘庄以北阜宁以南二百里复为解放军控制。按解放军于八月中旬克复叶挺城达成歼敌任务后，主动撤出，二十三日蒋军重占该城，先以整四师五九、一○二两个旅驻守，后由甫自台湾运至苏北之二十一师一一团接防，该团困守孤城仅月余，即不得不弃城逃窜。
    【新华社华中六日电】苏中苏北各地翻身农民正踊跃缴纳秋季公粮，以充实大反攻力量。苏中紫石新县海安等地，掀起交公粮竞赛，并组织千七百人的运输大队专门转运。兴化老圩区某军属自动将乙字田升为甲字田多交公粮。如（皋）保林乡，翻身贫雇农提升田亩等级交公粮者即达廿余人。宝应天平区屯完公粮后群众兴奋地说：“粮草屯足了，只等反攻大军到来！”苏北淮海区及阜（宁）东等县因受蒋、水、旱灾，早经民主政府明令减免的地区，许多农民仍纷纷自动缴纳。边沿区群众在地方武装和民兵的掩护下，亦日夜抢缴抢运。紫石爆炸功臣刘秉章以地雷封锁胡家集等据点，掩护边乡群众缴粮。有的则驾船绕过敌碉堡关卡，送到屯粮站。蒋占区群众对大反攻望眼欲穿，纷纷化装赶集或乘早晚越过敌人封锁线到解放区交公粮，中途被蒋匪被逐的群众，将粮倒散地上说：“宁愿糟踏也不给你狗日的吃！”徐溜蒋据点（现已收复）附近马张氏到解放区交公粮时，见到干部就放声大哭，诉说蒋军活埋她丈夫的惨状说：“我不愿免缴，把队伍吃饱了，大反攻好给我男人报仇！”
    【新华社华中六日电】苏中各地近发现封建奸霸暗害民主干部破坏土改复查的惨毒罪行。溱潼（原镇改设县）县陶家庄奸霸陶爱堂，其子在东台参加蒋记“还乡团”，陶逆因惧怕群众清算，乃纠集爪牙陶月堂、张昌浩等以卑鄙手段将该村自卫队长解学贵骗至河边，用绳勒死，将尸体载至河中、系以大石沉入河底企图灭迹。此案发生后，引起民主政府县公安局严重注意，当即派员四出侦查，终于案情大白，将三犯逮捕交群众公审处决。台（东台）北县石洪乡翻身农民朱振余在领导斗争恶霸王泽民时，夜间回家，半途遇着两只人形兽面的怪物，迎面扑来，用绳向朱颈上一套，反背欲去，朱抗拒呼救，附近居民闻声赶来，化装之蒋特凶犯，乃惊惶逃逸，朱才得救。次日，由群众检举主谋此案王逆泽民家属，全部落网。该县堤东区亦发生类此案件二起，深值各地警惕。现各地领导机关已将此等事件广为教育群众，并加强群众性的防奸保卫工作。
