　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd—The uprising of the people's armed forces in the southwestern provinces behind Chiang Kai-shek is growing stronger day by day, and they are attacking Chiang Kai-shek bandits everywhere. According to incomplete statistics listed in the Guangdong Newsletter published in the latest Shanghai "Wen Cong" seventh issue, the total number of Guangdong militia alone has reached at least 22,000. The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao revealed in September that the militia covers the vast rural areas of 33 counties. According to "Wen Cong," as of April this year, Feng Baiju's troops on Hainan Island had grown to more than 16,000 people, divided into four detachments, roaming Qiongshan, Wenchang, and Anding in the northern part of Qiongzhou Island; Baisha, Zhanxian, and Lingao in the northwest; Baoting and Ledong in the south; and Lehui and Wanning in the east. It is reported that recently the people of Qiongdao launched an enthusiastic campaign to join the army, which has further strengthened the unit. Since the surrender of Japan, the unit has successively defeated the invasion of Chiang Kai-shek's 46th Army of Han Liancheng and Cai Jingjun's six security regiments, and is currently taking the initiative to attack Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The militia in the vast area of ​​the Leizhou Peninsula in southern Guangdong to the western Shiwan Mountains are now persisting in the anti-Chiang struggle. According to "Wen Cong," the militia killed Dai Chaoen, the county magistrate of Suixi and military commander of the KMT, who invaded near Mazhang on March 8 this year. Since then, their prestige has greatly increased and they have launched attacks everywhere. A unified leadership has been established. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on July 21, they controlled the Leizhou Peninsula and many coastal areas. The agency's dispatch also revealed that local Chiang Kai-shek officials had to remove their badges and dress up as peasants when traveling to various places to avoid being captured. "Wen Cong" also stated that there are four militia divisions in this area, with a total of more than 3,000 people, active in Suixi, Hua County, Lianjiang, Maoming, Meilai, Wuzhou, and the sea areas of Zhanjiang and Wuchuan counties. After April, the above units joined forces with the militia in Luchuan and Bobai in southwestern Guangxi, and planned to form the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Region Government. The county governments of Hua County and Lianjiang have been established. According to "Wen Cong" and the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao in September, there are more than 500 militia members under He Juncai in Yingde County on the side of the Yuehan Railway in northern Guangdong, and more than 400 militia members under Wu Xinmin in Xinfeng County, often moving around Wengyuan, Longmen, Lantian and other counties; they captured the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Xinfeng County magistrate. In N雄, Shixing, Lechang, Qujiang and other counties bordering Hunan and Jiangxi, there is a militia unit of more than 200 people led by Li Lin and Guo Jinru. The Chiang Kai-shek county governments, township offices, and joint defense teams in various places are often attacked by the militia. According to "Wen Cong," in the Dongjiang area, Chiang Kai-shek bandits estimated that there were a total of 1,200 to 1,600 militia members in Dongguan, Boluo, Wuhua, Haifeng, Lufeng, and Huiyang counties. Militia also appear from time to time in the Xijiang and Hanjiang areas. The Guangxi militia is also booming. According to a special dispatch from Nanjing published in the Chiang Kai-shek Wuhan Daily on the 12th of this month, the militia in Quan County on the Xiang-Gui Railway and Xing'an, Guanyang, and Fuchuan counties in the southeast have recently attacked the Chiang Kai-shek township offices from time to time, seized weapons, and strengthened themselves. With the slogan of anti-conscription and anti-grain requisition, activities have spread to 27 townships. The leaders include students and primary school teachers. "Wen Cong" stated that Huang Shaoxiong, vice president of the Chiang Party's Supervisory Yuan, and Huang Xuchu, chairman of the Guangxi Province, are from Rong County, southeastern Guangxi. Huang Weiruo, principal of Chengcheng Middle School in the nearby Teng County and Beiliu, led the "Democratic Alliance Revolutionary Army" with more than 200 people to occupy the area of ​​@山 in the county. This unit launched an uprising on the night of February 20th in the lunar calendar this year. They put forward slogans such as opposing the "three requisitions" of conscription, grain requisition, and purchase, realizing democratic independence and peace, overthrowing fascism, overthrowing traitors, everyone wants food, everyone wants work, and everyone wants to study. They once attacked Rong County. According to Pan Hejing, a Guizhou Songtao senator captured in Luxi Shatuji, the people of Guizhou province have been forced to armed resistance against Chiang Kai-shek bandits due to heavy burdens and miscellaneous taxes, and their numbers are very large. He also said that the people in the southwest who are in dire straits are looking forward to the People's Liberation Army to rescue them as if they were looking forward to the clouds in a severe drought.
