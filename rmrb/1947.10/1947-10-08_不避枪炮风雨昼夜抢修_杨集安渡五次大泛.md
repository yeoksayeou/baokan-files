　　Repairing Day and Night, Braving Bullets and Rain
  　Yangji'an Ferry Experiences Five Major Floods
    [Report from Our Newspaper in Jilu Yu on the 5th] Yangji (originally belonging to Shouzhang County, now incorporated into Yunbei), a famous dangerous point on the south bank of the Yellow River in Yunbei County, under the leadership of our Third Repair and Defense Office, overcame all kinds of obstacles from the Chiang bandits, worked day and night to carry out emergency repairs, and safely navigated five major floods. This spring, when the Chiang bandits occupied the south bank of the Yellow River, they dug trenches and built bunkers on the Yangji embankment, doing everything possible to damage the dangerous works. To prevent major floods, our local armed forces drove out the Chiang bandits, burned their bunkers, seized the opportunity to repair the dangerous works, and safely navigated the first major flood until the major flood season. However, when the second major flood came on August 16, the Chiang bandits invaded Lühutong, Caowa and other villages more than ten miles away from Yangji. They also set up strongholds in Liulou (ten miles away from Yangji), and frequently harassed the Yangji rescue project. At that time, the dam revetments of the dangerous works were being scoured by mud and water, showing signs of shaking. On the 19th, the first dam's revetment fell, half of the second dam was twisted off by mud and water, the base of the third dam was submerged by two inches, and the large embankment between the third and fourth dams and the fourth and fifth dams was also eroded by more than three meters, and it was on the verge of breaching. The situation was so critical at the time that the Third Repair and Defense Office, regardless of the obstruction of the Chiang bandits, immediately informed the masses of various villages to come to the rescue. Meng Xiaodong, director of the Repair and Defense Office, took the lead in making revetments, and Liu Zhichong, head of the secretary section of the Repair and Defense Office, also participated in transporting stones. More than 500 men, women, old and young from nearby villages came to drive piles and throw stones. After eight days and nights, without stopping in the rain, wind, and scorching sun, two children insisted on carrying soil in large baskets all night long. Although Lu Huiqing, the section chief of the section, was fifty years old, he never left the dangerous works for a single step during the several days and nights of capturing the danger, running back and forth on the dam, directing and supervising the work. On the 26th, he finally overcame the flood and turned the dam from danger to safety. After the 26th, in order to ensure the consolidation of the revetments, repairs were continuously added, but the harassment of the Chiang bandits became more frequent, so that work could not be done during the day, and the cadres and engineering team had to cross the river at night to carry out emergency repairs. When the fourth major flood came, the revetment of the fourth dam was scoured by the flood again, and five meters of the revetment body was torn off, and it immediately showed a dangerous state again. Director Meng of the Repair and Defense Office discovered that in the dark night on September 9, when he could not see his palm, he led more than 60 masses and engineering team members to desperately tie the revetment with a large rope, so that no danger occurred. During the fifth major flood, on September 18, the revetment at the site fell again, but it was finally protected by spreading straw and soil. After five major floods and more than a month of emergency repairs, a total of 1.8 million catties of straw, 50,000 catties of hemp, 1,200 cubic meters of stones, 3,000 piles, 10,000 willow branches, and more than 30,000 bricks were used, and more than 5,000 carts were used in total. During the five major floods, thanks to the hard rescue efforts, they finally escaped from danger safely.
    [Another News] On September 26, the sixth major flood arrived, and our Third Repair and Defense Office was leading the masses to continue to repair the Yangji revetment to resist the major flood, but the Chiang bandits invaded Zhudian, one mile away from the Yangji dangerous works by the river, and fired several shots to disperse the rescue workers there, making the project intermittent. The spokesperson of the Repair and Defense Office said: "If the Chiang bandits continue to harass in this way, making it impossible to carry out rescue work, once the flood season breaks the banks, the Chiang bandits should bear all the responsibility."

　　不避枪炮风雨昼夜抢修
  　杨集安渡五次大泛
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】黄河南岸郓北县著名险工杨集（按：原属寿张县今划入郓北）在我第三修防处领导下，战胜蒋匪百般阻扰，昼夜抢险，安渡五次大泛。今春蒋匪进占黄河南岸时，即在杨集堤上挖掘壕沟，建修碉堡，尽极破坏该处险工能事，为防大泛，我地方武装曾将蒋匪驱逐，烧毁其碉堡，抓紧时机，抢修险工，一直到大泛期，安渡第一次大泛。但八月十六日第二次大泛来时，蒋匪又侵距杨集十余里的吕胡同、曹洼等村。并在刘搂（距杨集十里）按设据点，经常出扰杨集抢险工程。是时该险工坝埽，被泥水掏刷，呈现摇动，十九日，第一坝掉蛰，第二坝被泥水扭掉了半个，第三坝坝基被淹二公寸，三、四坝与四、五坝之间的大堤，亦被掏去三公尺多，眼看就要决口。当时情况如此危急，第三修防处不顾蒋匪阻扰，立即传到各村群众赶来抢救。修防处主任孟晓东，亲自带头做埽，修防处秘书科长刘智崇，亦参加运石，附近村庄男女老少五百余人，赶来打桩抛石，历经八昼夜，在风雨交加炎日炙晒之下，未有停息，有二个儿童以大筐抬土，曾坚持一整夜，该段修防段长卢惠卿年虽五十，但在几昼夜擒险中，始终未脱离险工一步，在坝上跑来跑去，指挥督工，至廿六，终于战胜洪水，使堤坝转危为安。廿六日以后，为保证埽坝巩固，仍不断增修，但蒋匪出扰更繁，以至白天不能工作，干部和工程队，只得在夜间过河抢修。第四次大汛来时，第四坝括头扫又被洪流掏刷，埽身被撕去五公尺，立时又呈危急状态，修防处孟主任发觉，在九月九日伸手不见掌的黑夜中，又领导六十余群众与工程队员，拼命以大绠将埽缆住，致未出险。第五次大汛，至九月十八日，该处埽又掉蛰，但由于铺秸庄土，终于抢护。历经五次大泛，一个多月抢险，共用秸料一百八十万斤，麻五万斤，石子一千二百立方，桩三千根，柳条一万条，砖三万余块，共使用大车五千多辆。五次大泛中，由于奋力抢救，终安达脱险。
    【又讯】九月二十六日第六次大泛到来，我第三修防处正领导群众继续增修杨集扫坝，以抗拒大泛，但蒋匪又侵至河边距杨集险工之一里处朱店，数次鸣枪驱散该处抢险员工，使工程时断时续。该修防处发言人称：“若蒋匪如此继续骚扰，使该处无法抢险，一旦汛期决口，蒋匪应负一切责任。”
