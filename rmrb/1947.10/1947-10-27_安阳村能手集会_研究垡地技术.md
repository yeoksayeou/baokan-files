    Anyang Village Experts Gather
    To Study Sod Turning Techniques
    [This newspaper PingShun News] The Anyang Village Autumn Harvest and Autumn Planting Command Post in the Seventh District held a meeting of thirty-seven skilled plowmen on the night of the fourth day of the ninth lunar month to study plowing techniques. Cui Baocheng, Niu Gouhe and others said: "If you want to plow more land, feed the livestock well with grass and fodder at night, get up early in the morning, unload early in the morning, and unload late in the afternoon so the livestock have time to breathe. You can plow three mu of land every day." Li Hebao said, "Plowing deep and wide, the livestock wanders less, plowing is more and better, the livestock runs less; plowing shallow and narrow, the livestock only runs, they can’t rest much, the livestock are strained, and little land is plowed." Fu Wanlin and Hou Qiutang said, "Plow more and harrow less in the autumn, plow less and harrow more in the spring, and the benefits are great. As the saying goes, autumn plowing without harrowing will freeze pests to death and freeze perennial weeds to death; plow less and harrow more in the spring to cultivate the seedlings steadily." Niu Baocun said: "Now is really good, you can plow the land even without livestock. In the past, even if you made good food, you couldn’t invite someone without livestock to come and plow." In the heated discussion, everyone became more energetic. The next day, Niu Gouhe and Cui Baocheng fed their livestock before the gong rang and went to the fields to plow as soon as it was light. Each person plowed three mu in one day.

    [This newspaper PingShun News] The Anyang Labor Hero Cui Fubao Team in the Seventh District, under the form of a full village plowing contract, started on the 24th day of the eighth lunar month and plowed the first time on all 99.15 mu of autumn land in thirteen days until the seventh day of the ninth lunar month. Now the Fubao team has extracted four male full laborers to send 34 dan of fertilizer and 32 dan of pen manure to the land one day, fertilizing 2.7 mu of land. Four women and six children have threshed 25.3 mu of corn stubble in one day, and they are now working hard to send fertilizer to plow the land a second time. Thirty-seven head of livestock in the whole village are dispatched every day to seize the time for plowing. According to the thirty-seven skilled plowmen, the 1,520 mu of sloping and flat land in the whole village can be plowed the first time in three more days. Autumn plowing, after recalling past suffering, has enlightened class consciousness, and everyone has become more nervous. Labor Hero Cui Fubao was the first to say: "In the past, I suffered to death working as a long-term laborer, suffering for the landlord. Now, suffering is so we can get the grain into our own homes, truly suffering for ourselves." Thirty-seven mouths said in unison: "That's absolutely true!" After the discussion, the enthusiasm was great. Many people, including Baocheng and others, used to go to the fields after breakfast. After mobilization, thirty-seven head of livestock went to the fields to start plowing as soon as it was light, and the morale was very high.

    安阳村能手集会
    研究垡地技术
    【本报平顺讯】七区安阳村秋收秋耕指挥部，在阴九月初四日夜召开犁地能手三十七人会议，研究犁地技术，崔保成、牛狗和等说：“想要多犁地，牲口黑夜下草料喂饱，清晨早起，上午早卸，下午迟卸，牲口有喘息时间，每天能犁三亩地。”李何保说：“犁深吃宽，牲口少窜，犁多又好，牲口少跑；犁浅吃窄，牲口光跑，不能多歇，牲口费力，犁地又少。”傅万林、侯秋堂说：“秋天多犁少耙，春天少犁多耙，好处很大，正如俗话秋耕不耢，好冻死病害，冻死宿根草；春天少犁多耢，养垧捉苗稳。”牛保存说：“现在真是好，没牲口也能犁下地，在过去没牲口的做上好饭也请不到人家。”在热烈的讨论中，大家更加劲大，第二天牛狗和、崔保成二人不等打锣就喂饱牲口，刚明就到地犁地，每人一天都犁三亩。
