Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Washington Dispatch: Continuing price hikes in the United States have increasingly worsened the people's living conditions and health. Washington newspapers report that after Truman issued a statement on October 1st urging the American people to conserve food, wheat prices rose by seven cents, and livestock feed and egg prices also increased accordingly. Furthermore, according to a joint report released on the 4th by New York City Mayor O'Dwyer and city health and welfare officials, milk prices have risen by 30% since last June, and other food prices have risen by 40%. As a result, many families cannot afford enough food. In New York City alone, the lives of 153,000 children relying on relief are severely affected. Since last January, the number of children in the city requesting free meals at school has increased by 8.4%. This indicates that some families are skipping a meal for their children at home to save food. The report anticipates that the number of people suffering from illness due to malnutrition will increase by thousands every day. The Detroit Free Press reports that 25,850 children in Detroit are out of school because they cannot afford shoes and clothing, an increase of 24% compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Washington Dispatch: Figures announced by the US Department of Commerce on the 2nd show that US foreign trade has declined to its lowest level since October 1946. Total exports in August were $1,139.5 million, a decrease of 8.1% from $1,240 million in June. Total imports in August were $399 million, a decrease of 11% from $447 million in July. The total value of commercial goods exported in August was $1,025.4 million, a sharp decrease of 11% from $1,124.5 million in July. The total value of relief supplies planned for export from the US to Japan in August was $12.22 million, but the actual total, including the amount exported under the aid to Greece and Turkey plan, only reached $8.9 million.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: New York Dispatch: Labor strikes in the United States are expanding, and have now affected US civil aviation companies. Due to the strike by 500 members of the US "Air Line Pilots Association," transatlantic flights by American Overseas Airlines have been suspended. According to the association's chairman, Behncke, the strike is a protest against the company's refusal to negotiate wage increases. Those currently involved in labor strikes include 3,000 workers at shipbuilding companies who have been on strike since June, approximately 6,000 workers at the United Farm Equipment and Metal Workers industrial union in Chicago, and 5,000 Teamsters Union truck drivers in New York City. Dockworkers in Albany, New York, and 5,000 film, science, art, and mechanical workers of the American Federation of Labor are also on strike. The majority of striking workers are fighting for wage increases.

    【新华社陕北六日电】华盛顿讯：美物价之继续上涨，已使人民生活与健康情况日益恶化。华盛顿报纸载称：在十月一日杜鲁门发表敦促美国人民节省粮食之声明后，麦价上涨七分，牲畜饲料与蛋价亦随之上涨。另据纽约市长奥德威与管理城市健康福利人员四日所公布之联合报告称：自去年六月以来，牛乳价格涨了百分之三十，其他食物价格涨了百分之四十，影响所及，许多家庭买不到足够之食粮。仅纽约市，十五万三千靠救济为生的儿童生活大受影响。自去年一月以来，该市要求在学校里免费用餐的儿童数增加了百分之八点四。这表示一些家庭为了节省粮食而取消了孩子们在家里吃的一顿饭。该报告预料，因营养不良而患病的人每天将增加几千名。底特律自由报报导称：在底特律有二万五千八百五十名儿童因无钱购买鞋子和衣服而失学，与去年相较，失学儿童增加百分之二十四。
    【新华社陕北四日电】华盛顿讯：据二日美商务部所宣布之数字，显示美国对外输出入贸易已下降至一九四六年十月以来之最低数量。八月份输出总值为十一亿三千九百五十万元，较六月份之十二亿四千万减少百分之八点一。八月份输入总值为三亿九千九百万元，较七月份之四亿四千七百万元减少百分之十一。八月份商业货物之输出总额为十亿二千五百四十万元，较七月份之十一亿二千四百五十万元锐减百分之十一，八月份美日所计划输出之救济物资总值为一千二百二十万元，但实际上包括援助希土计划所输出之数量在内之总额只达八百九十万元。
    【新华社陕北六日电】纽约讯：美国罢工工潮在扩大中，现已波及美国之民航公司。由于美“飞行员协会”五百会员之罢工，美国海外航空公司横越大西洋之飞行业已停顿。据该协会主席贝汉基称：罢工系抗议公司拒绝商谈增资问题。目前已卷入工潮者，包括自六月以来即进行罢工之造船业公司三千名工人，芝加哥产联农具工业六千左右工人和纽约市劳联卡车司机五千名工人。纽约州奥尔巴尼城之码头工人和劳联之五千名电影、科学、艺术、机械工作者亦在罢工中。大多数罢工工人都为增加工资而斗争。
