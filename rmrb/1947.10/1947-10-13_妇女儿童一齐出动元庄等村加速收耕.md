[From our newspaper in Licheng] To accelerate the completion of the harvesting work, Yuanzhuang Village has made extensive use of auxiliary labor. Wang Yuexian, a member of the Women's Salvation Committee, led a group discussion on the autumn harvest. She said, "In the past, when we didn't have land, we couldn't move even if we wanted to. Now that we've been liberated and have land to cultivate, we must work hard. The elders often say that more labor brings more blessings. While the men are fighting at the front, we must do a good job in production in the rear. When the front and the rear are combined, we can overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and live a good life together." Dong Shuangjing said, "I guarantee that I will harvest grain and corn without using male labor, saving labor to help plant more wheat." All seven women in the group said the same thing. Finally, Jiang Yuexian also proposed, "My man is fighting at the front, and I guarantee that this year's autumn harvest and planting will not be delayed." They also set standards, with each woman equaling seven-tenths of a male worker's labor. They assigned tasks according to skill, planned to harvest grain, beans, and corn, and thresh without using men. They also pledged to go to the fields to plow and lead livestock to help plant wheat. The next day, they started working in the fields, and the seven people harvested eleven mu of grain in two days, finishing the grain harvest for the entire group. Now, women throughout the village are competing with Jiang Yuexian's group, and the autumn harvest and planting work is being completed quickly.

[Further News] In Changning Village, Third District, women's awareness has been unprecedentedly raised during the year-long land reform movement. When the autumn harvest was approaching, Li Juhua, the chairman of the Women's Salvation Committee, convened the Women's Salvation Committee members of the whole village to discuss how to help with the autumn harvest. Wang Xianglan and Jiang Baoying, of the Zheng Nan Zhuang group, and their fifteen members said: The militia is going to fight, and we are responsible for the autumn harvest. The front and the rear must compete, and we must both win victories. In two and a half days, they harvested thirty mu of grain. They said: Young women go to the fields, elderly women cut grain at home, and women with bound feet look after the children. The Southeast Village also discussed the method of winning red stars, and the leadership seized these cases and praised them, which influenced groups such as Li Qiaozhen, Hailong's mother, and Wang Huangnv to actively participate in the autumn harvest movement. It is now estimated that 161 women have participated, harvesting a total of 1,080 mu of grain, freeing up labor to cultivate 323 mu of wheat.

[From our newspaper in Shahe] The children of Zhengzhao Village, during this autumn harvest, are divided into four teams. Each team has established a primary school, collectively producing during the day, and the leaders hold review meetings at night. They also write two large calligraphy characters at noon. Li Fengyun, the female leader of the children's corps, and four others helped each other and harvested four mu of millet in one morning. Every night, they can still spin an average of four liang of cotton after holding review meetings. Du Sengqin leads a female mutual aid group. Four people can earn 300 yuan (大洋) in one morning of cutting grain, which they exchange for seed oil to prepare for the spinning group to light lamps at night. Hou Mingxiu led a mutual aid group of four people, who cultivated four mu of stubble in one morning. Both male and female students are earning wages to buy oil for studying and weaving.
