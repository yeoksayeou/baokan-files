　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 25th: Boston - The annual meeting of the American Federation of Industrial Organizations (CIO) passed several resolutions on the 18th, demanding the restoration of the Big Three cooperation, opposing warmongers, opposing all reactionary measures of the American authorities leading to fascism, and reaffirming its determination to safeguard American democracy and world peace. The main resolutions of the conference on domestic issues included opposing anti-communist pledges in trade unions, opposing anti-labor bills, demanding the abolition of Truman's "Loyalty Order," abolishing the House Un-American Activities Committee, which threatens American freedom, and abolishing racial discrimination in schools, guaranteeing the freedom of thought and political belief for government employees, etc. On foreign policy issues, the conference unanimously passed a resolution demanding the restoration of the policy of Big Three unity as a prerequisite for world peace. "The American people oppose any attempt that violates their fundamental interests and aspirations, just as they oppose any form of aggression by the United States or other countries. The offensive led by evil forces attempting to incite another world war will inevitably be met with strong and relentless opposition from all freedom-loving and peace-loving people. The will of the people of all countries will eventually end the activities of these few criminals." The resolution continued: The conference firmly believes that "lasting peace must guarantee the rights of self-determination and self-governance for the people of all semi-independent, economically backward, or colonial countries, freeing them from any foreign military or economic interference and oppression." The conference also opposed conscription and urged international cooperation within trade union organizations, pointing out that "through the World Federation of Trade Unions, it has been proven that workers can formulate general programs to ensure peace and fully enjoy political democracy, economic security, and freedom from want." The annual meeting also passed resolutions demanding the restoration of rent and price controls, the implementation of rationing, and the suppression of speculation and excessive profits.

    【新华社陕北二十五日电】波斯顿讯：美国产业职工联合会年会于十八日通过多项决议，要求恢复三强合作，反对战争贩子，反对美国当局一切引向法西斯主义的反动举措，重申维护美国民主与世界和平之决心。大会关于国内问题之决议主要为反对在工会中作反共产党之具结，反对反劳工法案，要求取销杜鲁门之“忠诚令”，取销威胁美国自由的众院非美活动调查委员会，并废除学校中之种族歧视，保障政府雇工思想与政治信仰之自由等。大会关于外交问题，一致通过决议要求恢复三强团结之政策，以作为世界和平之先决条件。“美国人民反对违背其基本利益与愿望之任何企图，一如反对美国或其他国家任何形式之侵略。恶势力所领导之力图煽起另一次大战之攻势，必将遭受一切爱好自由与和平之人民之强大而无情的反对。各国人民的意志终将结束此一少数罪恶分子之活动。”决议继称：大会深信“持久和平必须保障一切半独立的，经济落后的，或殖民地的国家人民之自决与自治权利。使之免于任何外国军事的或经济的干涉与压迫。”大会亦反对征兵，并敦促在职工机构中实行国际合作，指出“经过世界职工联盟，业已证明了工人能够制订一般的纲领，以确保和平和充份享受政治民主、经济安全，且使人民不虞匮乏。”年会并通过决议，要求恢复对房租与物价的管制，实行口粮配给，制止投机及超额利润等。
