　　Two posthumous works of Comrade Fan Ting
    Before Comrade Fan Ting passed away, although he was critically ill, his patriotic and people-loving fighting will remained firm and unwavering. He still held a pen to write poems, denouncing the Chiang bandits. These are two of his posthumous works:
    1.  Ode to Land Reform
        It is imperative that there be no landlords anywhere,
        Only then can the people have democracy;
        The object of the revolution must be clearly identified,
        The feudal foundation is the landlord.
    2.  Rebuking the Chiang Bandit
        The people judge Chiang Kai-shek,
        Suddenly, a thousand heads grow on his neck,
        So that everyone can kill one,
        Drenching in pleasure to avenge the public.
    Comrade Fan Ting cared about politics while ill, never forgetting it for a moment. He often said with emotion: "Half my life in revolution, only when I came to the CCP did I find a bright path." As for personal matters and family, he never worried or cared about them. Once, when he woke up from a faint, he said: "I can rest assured about family matters, but I just didn't see Chiang Kai-shek being judged by the people."

　　范亭同志遗作二首
    续范亭同志逝世前，虽已病危，但他的爱国卫民的战斗意志，仍坚定不移，犹持笔作诗，斥骂蒋匪。这是他遗作中的两首：
    一、吟土改
    必须到处无地主，人民才能有民主；革命对象须认清，封建基础是地主。
    二、斥蒋贼
    人民审判蒋中正，项上忽生千万头，好教每人杀一个，淋漓痛快报公仇。
    范亭同志病中关心政治，未曾一刻忘怀。他常感慨的说：“革命半生，到了中共这边才找到一条光明之路”。而对于个人问题及家属，则从不顾虑与计较，有一次昏过去醒来时他说：“家属问题我放心得下，只是没有看着蒋介石被人民审判。”
