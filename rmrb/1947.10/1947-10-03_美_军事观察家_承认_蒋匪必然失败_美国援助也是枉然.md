　　US "Military Observers" Admit
　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Inevitably will Fail
　　US Aid is in Vain
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st] The truth that no amount of aid from American imperialism can save its running dog Chiang Kai-shek from his inevitable failure is being admitted even by the so-called "military observers" in China who are directly carrying out American aid for Chiang's civil war. According to the "Shi Yu Chao" magazine published in Shanghai on July 18th, many American "military observers" in China estimated the future of the Chinese civil war, saying: "This civil war can only be delayed for another six months. Even if the United States provides immediate aid, there is not enough time." "The Chinese Communists will sweep the country in two years." Associated Press reporter Milks reflected the opinion of most American and British "diplomatic observers" in Nanjing, stating: "Even if a large batch of guns, ammunition, and military supplies are sent immediately, it will not improve the military situation of the Chinese (Chiang) government much." "Even if the United States continues to provide massive assistance to China (Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang), it will not solve the problem, and at best, it may only temporarily give the collapsing Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang) economy a very short respite."

  　美国援助也是枉然
    【新华社陕北一日电】美国帝国主义任何援助也决然挽救不了其走狗蒋介石必然失败的命运，这一真理甚至在直接执行美国援蒋内战的所谓在华“军事观察家”中也不能不予承认。据七月十八日在沪出版的“时与潮”杂志中透露，许多美国在华“军事观察家”对中国内战前途估计称：“这内战只可以再拖延半年，美国纵使立即援助的话，时间也不容许了。”“两年后中共将席卷全国。”美联社记者密尔克斯曾反映南京大多数的美、英“外交观察家”意见称：“纵令此刻就马上送来一大批枪炮和军火，也不会使中国（蒋）政府的军事形势改善多少”，“纵令美国继续大量援助中国（蒋家匪帮），也不能解决问题，充其量或许只能暂时给予崩溃中的中国（蒋家匪帮）经济以一个极短的喘息时期。”
