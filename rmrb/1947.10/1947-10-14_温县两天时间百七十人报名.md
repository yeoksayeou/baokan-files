　　Wen County: 170 People in Two Days Sign Up
    [Report from our newspaper in Wen County] During the two days of September 23rd and 24th, while participating in guarding the gates of the Independent Battalion, 171 young and middle-aged liberated peasants voluntarily signed up to join the army. Everyone's morale was very high. Cui Fafa, an eighteen-year-old from Dongliu Village, Fifth District, used the 800 yuan the village gave him to buy a military cap at a tailor shop and happily put it on. Zhao Shenfu from Lin Village was small in stature, and Deputy Company Commander Lu asked him to be a messenger. He said, "I'm here to be a soldier, not a messenger. A messenger can't carry a gun to fight the stubborn army." They also asked him to be a messenger at the county government, but he firmly refused: "Can being a messenger in the county fight Chiang Kai-shek? Can it protect the gate?" Later, they approved his enlistment. Some people were not allowed to go because they were too old, and they were very unhappy. Zheng Jingzhi from Yaozhuang was sick and already thirty years old, but he was still an activist in the village. When asked to go back, he said, "Everyone else is going, how can I have the face to go back alone? Even if you ask me to feed the horses and cook, I'll do my part." After several attempts to persuade him, he went back with tears in his eyes. County Magistrate Hou called on the new soldiers to join the Independent Battalion to protect the fruits of liberation and to win glory for Wen County. Finally, everyone shouted slogans, responding to County Magistrate Hou's call to guard our gate well. In the rain, everyone was in high spirits, smiling broadly as they went to the troops.

　　温县两天时间百七十人报名
    【本报温县讯】在九月二十三、二十四两天的参加独立营看守大门中，有一百七十一名青壮翻身农民，自动报名参了军，大家情绪非常高涨。五区东流村十八岁的崔富发，将村送给他八百元跑到缝衣铺买了一顶军帽，高兴的带上。林村赵慎甫人长的小，鲁副连长叫他当通讯员，他说：“我来当兵，不是当通讯员，当通讯员不能背枪打顽固军。”又叫他到县政府当通讯员，他坚决的拒绝：“往县里当通讯员能打蒋介石？能保住大门？”后来批准了他入伍。有些人因年纪大，不叫他们去很不高兴。尧庄郑京智因有病，年纪已三十岁，在村还是个积极分子，叫他回去，他说：“人家都去，我一人怎有脸回去？那怕叫我喂马做饭也干一份。”经过劝几次，他才两眼含泪回去。侯县书号召新战士同志们，参加独立营保卫翻身果实，要为温县争光。最后大家喊起口号，响应侯县书号召，要看好我们大门。在雨淋中大家精神饱满喜眉笑眼的往部队去了。（其芝、凤岐、英俊）
