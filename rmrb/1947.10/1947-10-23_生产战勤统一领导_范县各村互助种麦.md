　　Unified Leadership for Production and War Support
　　Mutual Aid in Wheat Planting in Fan County
[This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 20th dispatch] The masses in various districts and villages of Fan County are vigorously carrying out the movements of supporting the front, autumn harvesting, and wheat planting. This time, the war support tasks include stretcher-bearing, carting, carrying packages and delivering messages, guiding the way, transporting goods, milling rice, and caring for the wounded. The majority of young and middle-aged people and livestock have set out. The county needs to complete 50,000 pairs of military shoes in three days, so autumn harvesting and wheat planting are facing great difficulties. After the Fifth District received the task, Cui, the secretary of the sub-district committee, first convened a meeting of party members in the Chengguan district, reported the victory news, and explained that to strive for the victory of the counter-offensive, it is not only necessary to complete the war support tasks, but also to actively plant wheat. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination and strength to complete the tasks, fearing no difficulties, and discussed the establishment of command departments in each village to divide and lead the work. The village head, militia captain, and finance committee member are responsible for war support; the instructor, chairman of the peasant association, and chairman of the women's association are responsible for production. The tense atmosphere spread to every village. Women immediately went to participate in cutting soybeans and doing field work, and rushed to make military uniforms and shoes in the evening. Zhuo Geng Wang Village assigned 36 pairs of shoes, and the women in the village volunteered to make 40 pairs, and each was also responsible for ten sets of military uniforms. Now most villages have been organized in an orderly manner. Without livestock, people pull plows. Each village also challenged: "Not to leave an inch of land uncultivated!" Agreed to complete more than 75% of wheat planting before the 15th day of the old lunar calendar September.
[This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 21st dispatch] Shi Fo Dian in the Seventh District of Pu County, the whole village has 20 hectares of land. Last year, forced mutual aid failed. This year, free association is adopted (such as pushing military flour), which are all pushed by women, freeing up cattle to plow the land. Now more than 80% of the wheat has been sown. Military dependent Wang Xing San said: "My work can be done by me and the women at home, no need to cultivate for me." He joined the mutual aid group and took the lead in pulling the plow. Some waterlogged land in the village is now being drained to prepare for wheat planting. Zhai Cheng Yang Mutual Aid Group in Ba Village, Seventh District, has been established for half a year. The group has a total of 24 households and 391 mu of land, and also cultivates 81 mu for the families of soldiers. On the 8th of this month, the group held a summary meeting. In addition to completing the cultivation of the land for the families of soldiers, the group also planted 265 mu of wheat, accounting for 70% of the total land (there are 40 mu of waterlogged land that cannot be planted immediately). In addition, the group has completed war support tasks, and also has four cotton gins. One month of ginning will earn 1,358,000 yuan. Ba Gui Bao and Zhai Zhao Yue said after returning from stretcher-bearing: "It's really good, you can earn money even when you are not at home, and the wheat has been planted. I'll go back to stretcher-bearing next time!" Under the influence of their group, the masses want to join the mutual aid group.

    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】范县各区村群众，正轰轰烈烈的开展着支前、秋收、种麦运动。这次战勤任务有担架、大车、挑包送信，带路、搬运、碾米、侍候伤员等，青壮年及牲口绝大部分出发，全县三天要完成五万双军鞋，因此，秋收种麦感到很大困难。五区当接到任务后，由崔分委书记，首先召开了城关区党员大会，报告了胜利消息，说明争取反攻胜利不只要完成战勤，而且要积极种麦，大家一致表示有决心有力量完成任务，不怕任何困难，并讨论各村建立指挥部分工领导等问题，村长、自卫队长、财政委员，负责战勤；指导员、农会主任、妇会主任，担任生产。紧张的空气，传遍各个村，妇女们马上都去参加割豆子做地里活，并在晚上赶做军衣、军鞋。卓耿王庄布置了三十六双鞋，该村妇女自报要做四十双，每人还负责十身军衣。现大部村庄都已有秩序的组织起来，没有牲口，用人拉犁，各村并挑战：“不荒一分地”！约定在旧历九月十五前，完成种麦百分之七十五以上。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】濮县七区石佛店，全村土地二十顷，去年强制互助失败了，今年采取自由结合（如推军面），都是妇女人推，腾出牛犁地，现在耩上的麦子已达百分之八十以上。军属王行三说：“我的活，由我和家里娘儿们就行了，用不着给我代耕。”他参加了互助组，带头拉犁拉耧。该村有些水淹地，现正放水准备耩麦。七区巴村翟成仰互助组，成立至今已半年，全组共廿四户，地三百九十一亩，另外给抗属代耕八十一亩。本月八日，该组开了总结会，除把抗属的地种完外，组里的麦子也种到二百六十五亩，合土地总数百分之七十（有四十亩水淹地，马上还不能种）。此外，该组除完成战勤任务，还有四个轧花车，轧一个月，就赚一百三十五万八千元。巴贵宝、翟兆月，出担架回来说：“真好，不在家也能批钱，麦子也种上了，再回出担架，还是我去吧！”在他们组影响下，群众都想参加互助组。
