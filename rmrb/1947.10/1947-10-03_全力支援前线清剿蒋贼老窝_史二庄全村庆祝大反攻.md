　　Fully Support the Front Lines in Cleansing Chiang Kai-shek's Lair
  　Shi'er Zhuang Village Celebrates the Great Counter-Offensive
    [Report from our newspaper] Just as the great autumn harvest was in full swing, the news of the victory of the great counter-offensive reached Shi'er Zhuang in the Ninth District of Wu'an. The villagers' confidence in victory was greatly enhanced, and their enthusiasm for production was increased. On the 21st, the villagers held a celebration rally for the victory of the counter-offensive. A huge map of Central China was hung in the venue, with red arrows indicating the direction of our army's advance, and red circles indicating the vast areas and towns liberated by our army; a red silk and green ribbon were hung on Chairman Mao's portrait; the masses beat gongs and drums and sang loudly. At the meeting, the victorious situation of our army on all fronts and Chiang Kai-shek's panic were reported in detail. Political Director Niu Fushan said: "The victory of the great counter-offensive shows that the power of our People's Liberation Army is infinitely powerful, and we will surely win. We must be invigorated and maintain close contact with the front. The front eliminates old Chiang Kai-shek, and we in the rear must eliminate young Chiang Kai-shek. We must also intensify the great autumn harvest and production movement and fully support the front." Ren Chengrang said on behalf of their group: "Our army has won a great victory at the front, and we must strengthen the preferential treatment of soldiers in the rear. Our army has traveled so far to fight, it must be very hard. We must ensure a good autumn harvest in the rear, grow more wheat, save more, and pay more public grain to solve the difficulties for the front." Zhang Weishen said on behalf of their group: "The victory of the great counter-offensive has begun. Our group has automatically joined the war. We have prepared everything. As long as the government says so, we will cross the Yellow River to the front. We will participate in the war when there is fighting at the front, and help the masses there to stand up when there is no fighting. We will not return until old Chiang Kai-shek is defeated, and we will not return until the people of the whole country have stood up!" Retired soldier Hao Shuancheng said: "I am injured (my arm is injured and cannot be straightened), so I cannot go to the front to fight old Chiang Kai-shek, so I will deal with young Chiang Kai-shek in the rear. Today, I automatically joined the militia." Finally, it was unanimously proposed: to intensify the autumn harvest and not to lose a grain! Use all our strength to support the front! Wipe out Chiang Kai-shek's lair! Help the people of the whole country stand up! After the meeting, the village cadres actively led the villagers to harvest autumn crops and plant wheat, and decided to inspect the preferential treatment of soldiers during the Mid-Autumn Festival.
