Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th. In late September, a unit of the East China People's Liberation Army intercepted and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy forces retreating southeast from Zhaoyuan in the eastern foothills of the Dazeshan Mountains in Jiaodong. On the 24th of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek army's reorganized 9th Division's 9th and 76th Brigades, threatened from behind, were forced to retreat from Biguo, more than 40 li southeast of Zhaoyuan, in three directions toward Pingdu. On the 26th, they were intercepted by the People's Liberation Army in the Liangxiu Mountain, Huishan, and Matun areas on the eastern foothills of Dazeshan (located on the border of Pingdu, Zhaoyuan, Laiyang, and Yexian) and a fierce battle ensued. One company of our army repeatedly repelled three counterattacks by enemies several times their size. Another unit, a squad, repelled six enemy assaults without suffering any casualties. On the 27th, one platoon of our army again repelled three attacks by an enemy battalion at Huishan. Our artillery also displayed great power in the battle, leaving enemy corpses strewn across the fields. On the 28th, the People's Liberation Army launched a full-scale attack, and the enemy, unable to withstand it, fled in panic back to Pingdu city. In this battle, a total of over 2,000 enemy soldiers were killed and wounded.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd. Since the activation of the militia and armed work teams in the southwest of Laiyang, Jiaodong, they have suppressed Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and local despots, and supported the mass struggle. On September 12th, when the Chiang Kai-shek army invaded the Hualing area of the Sunshou district, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in Nancun took the opportunity to riot, killing Yu Xuewen, a cadre of our Nanhai Armed Forces Department, and Wu Xueshan, a district cadre, and wounding the village chief and the head of the Women's Rescue Association of the village. The village militia bravely resisted. Just as militiaman Wu Yushan was using a hand grenade to kill Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent Wu Guimin, the 5th Joint Defense Militia Armed Work Team of the district arrived and, together with the village militia, captured the murderers Wu Jingting and four others. A public trial was immediately held, and the masses unanimously demanded revenge for the dead, and angrily beat the five murderers to death with sticks. The other accomplices were released after education. The Chiang Kai-shek "Returning Home Corps" bandits forced the masses to hold a meeting in Zeqiao Village, Xiagezhuang District, allowing the despotic landlords to "reverse the settlements". In the middle of this ugly farce, the armed plainclothes team suddenly rushed into the meeting place and stabbed five bandits to death on the spot with bayonets. The masses cheered: "This time you have really 'returned home'!" Su Lizhun, a landlord and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent in Gengjiazhuang, Shuangshan District, organized landlords and local despots in a conspiracy to "reverse the settlements", and was also arrested and executed by the village masses leading the armed work team.
