Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Reports from various sources indicate that the US imperialist plan to destroy China is actively underway. Only forty days after Wedemeyer left China, a US Congressional military delegation arrived in China the week before. The delegation successively "inspected" Beiping, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, and left China on the 13th. The head of the delegation (also the chairman of the US House Military Committee), Cole, made successive speeches in Nanjing before leaving China on the 10th and 11th, expressing his agreement with the plan of the US warmonger Bullitt to aid Chiang in destroying China, that is, to buy off China's 400 million people with 1.35 billion US dollars to fight for the United States, and to have MacArthur govern China. Cole vigorously advocated the necessity of aiding Chiang and controlling China. He declared after meeting with Chiang Kai-shek for 45 minutes on the 11th that aid to Chiang Kai-shek "can be given according to the same conditions as with Greece and Turkey (i.e., given with 'supervision' by the United States)." As is well known, since Wedemeyer's visit to China, the US imperialists have already acquired a huge military base network including eleven bases, among which the bases in Taiwan and South China have been built under the supervision of Japanese war criminals Hasegawa and Ayukawa. According to an AFP report from Hong Kong on the 9th, a US mission has arrived in Hong Kong, "carrying orders to accelerate the construction of the Huangpu Naval Base," and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek had already allocated 50 billion Chiang coins in late last month to build the port. Traitor Chiang has also appointed the notorious American comprador Song Ziwen as the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, actively helping the US imperialists in their military and economic aggression against South China. Recently, Chiang's bandits have also invited the US fleet to immediately station in Yantai. US imperialism has obtained the privilege of investing in and controlling China's industrial, agricultural, transportation, municipal, and other economic sectors in a comprehensive manner. The US plan to supervise various departments of the Chiang government has also gradually become a reality. Following the arrival of American Yang Ge in China in late August as a "financial and foreign exchange advisor" to Chiang's bandits, American Pond arrived in China last month to serve as a "advisor" to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, responsible for "reforming China's codes"; the US military advisory group in China has been "working" in various departments of Chiang's bandit Ministry of National Defense since the 11th of last month; the US military training group in China has reorganized Chiang's bandit "Army University" according to the model of West Point Military Academy, thereby controlling the Chiang bandit's military education institutions; and the agreement on the US "supervision" of China's relief work, which will be implemented after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), was also approved by Chiang's bandit Executive Yuan on the 14th of this month.
　　During this period, Chiang Kai-shek, at the cost of national ruin and genocide, has obtained a steady stream of aid from US imperialism for his civil war to massacre the people. The US work to equip Chiang's bandits with twenty divisions can begin this month. The United States, through its "compensation" method, will supply Chiang Kai-shek with a large number of Japanese military factories, and its plan to help Chiang transport and reassemble them can begin within a few months. The first batch includes 17 Japanese military factories and more than 9,000 pieces of naval dock machinery. The United States has agreed to lend money to purchase 300 American ships to transport the military factories. The United States has also decided to sell the remaining military supplies of the US military in Japan and Korea to Chiang Kai-shek at a low price. This plan for the cheap sale of military supplies has obviously been agreed upon as a result of Wedemeyer's visit to China. Last month, the Shanghai Office of the US Foreign Liquidation Commissioner was upgraded to one of the central administrative offices of the US Foreign Liquidation Commission stationed abroad. The remaining materials of the US military in Japan, Korea, and other places are all under its control, and the agreement on the sale of remaining materials signed by the US and Chiang in August 1946 did not include the materials from the above-mentioned places. Colonel Lu Boxishi, the newly appointed head of the Shanghai administrative office, claimed on the 13th of last month that the purpose of upgrading the office was to speed up the transportation of the remaining materials of the US military to Chiang Kai-shek. The UNRRA's relief work in China has been further used by the United States as a naked tool to aid Chiang in his civil war and massacre of the Chinese people. After Wedemeyer's visit to China, in August, the UNRRA's China branch suddenly announced the cessation of relief north of 34 degrees north latitude, which was tantamount to simply ceasing relief to the Liberated Areas. In addition, the United States has also promised to give Chiang Kai-shek a US$30 million "relief loan" after the end of the UNRRA, and the agreement has been reached. According to a report in the Nanjing Dagang Bao on the 10th, quoting relevant sources, the US$100 million loan to Chiang recommended by Wedemeyer and approved by Truman is being negotiated by Chiang's bandit Foreign Minister Wang Shijie in Washington with Truman and Marshall. The loan will not be paid through the Export-Import Bank, and will take the form of a political loan. Although the US is considering the "method" of the loan, the loan will be given as soon as possible.
　　The true colors of US imperialism's complete destruction of China and Chiang Kai-shek's complete betrayal of China have been exposed without a doubt. However, the US imperialists and Chiang's bandits' conspiracy to destroy China will surely be smashed by the angry iron fists of the Chinese people. Even the Shanghai-based American-run Millard's Review published an article on July 19, when Wedemeyer came to China, pointing out that for imperialists, "China has proven to be a huge quicksand in the past. Her vast population and land have not only swallowed invaders, but also swallowed countless amounts of money." Lattimore, an American expert on Far Eastern affairs, wrote as early as June 24 this year, warning that "Japan fell from the Lugouqiao Bridge into the ocean of China, and has since been submerged and unable to climb out."

　　乘蒋家小朝廷危机四伏
  　美加紧策动亡华
    蒋贼以亡国灭种为条件换取金元军火屠杀人民
    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方消息显示：美帝国主义灭亡中国的计划正在积极进行。魏德迈离华才四十天，美国会军事考察团又已于周前到达中国，该团先后“考察”了北平、青岛、南京、上海等地，于十三日离华。该团团长（亦即美众院军事委员会主席）柯尔，在离华前于十日及十一日接连在南京发表谈话，表示同意美国战争贩子布立特援蒋灭华计划，即以十三亿五千万元收买中国四亿人民为美国作战，并以麦克阿瑟管辖中国。柯尔竭力鼓吹援蒋与管制中国之必要，彼于十一日与蒋介石会谈四十五分钟之后宣称：对蒋介石之援助“可按照与希、土同样的条件（即由美国加以‘监督’给予）。”如所周知，自魏德迈来华后，美帝国主义所已获得的包括十一个基地的巨大军事基地网中，台湾及华南的基地已由日本战犯长谷川、鲇川等监工兴筑。据法新社九日自香港报导，一美国使团已抵港，“携有加速进行建筑黄埔海军基地之命令”，而卖国贼蒋介石早已于上月下旬即已拨出五十亿元蒋币兴筑该港。蒋贼并已任命臭名昭著的美国买办宋子文为广东省府主席，积极帮助美帝对华南的军事经济侵略。最近，蒋匪又邀请美国舰队立即进驻烟台。美帝国主义已获得范围无所不包的投资控制中国工、农、交通、市政等经济部门的特权。美帝监督蒋政府各部门的计划，也已逐步见诸事实。继八月下旬美人杨格抵华担任蒋匪金融外汇“顾问”之后，美人庞德已于上月抵华任司法行政部“顾问”，负责“改革中国之法典”；美驻华军事顾问团已自上月十一日起在蒋匪国防部各部门“工作”；美驻华军事训练团已将蒋匪“陆军大学”按西点军校模型加以改组，从而控制了蒋匪军事教育机关；而将于联总结束后实行的美国“监督”中国救济工作的协定，亦已于本月十四日经蒋匪行政院通过。
    在此期间，蒋介石以亡国灭种为代价，已获美帝国主义对其屠杀人民的内战源源而来的援助；美国为蒋匪装备二十个师的工作，本月即可开始。美国经过其“赔偿”方式，以大量日本兵工厂供给蒋介石，助蒋运输及重新装配的计划，数月内即可开始。其中第一批即包括日本兵工厂十七座，海军船坞机器九千余件。美国已允贷款购买三百条美船作运输该项兵工厂之用。美国并已决定以在日本、朝鲜等地的美军剩余军火物资廉售予蒋介石，此项廉售军火计划显已因魏德迈的中国之行而获得协议。上月间美国外清理专员上海办事处，已升格为美国国外清理委员会驻外中央行政处之一，美军在日本、朝鲜等地剩余物资均置于其管制之下，而一九四六年八月美蒋成立的让售剩余物资协定，并未包括上述各地之物资在内。美方新任主持上海行政处的卢白希士上校于上月十三日声称：办事处升格之用意，即为加速运输美军剩余物资交予蒋介石。联总对中国的救济工作，已被美国进一步用作赤裸裸援蒋内战屠杀中国人民的工具，魏德迈来华后，八月间，联总中国分署即突然宣布停止对北纬三十四度以北之救济，实即干脆停止救济解放区。此外美国并答应于联总结束后给予蒋介石三千万美元“救济贷款”，协议已经成立。另据十日南京大刚报引有关人士消息：魏德迈所建议并经杜鲁门批准的美对蒋十万万美元的贷款，正由蒋匪外交部长王世杰在华府与杜鲁门及马歇尔谈判中，该款将不经过进出口银行给付，并将采政治贷款形式，虽则美方正在考虑贷款的“方式”，但贷款将尽早给予。
    美帝国主义完全灭亡中国与蒋介石完全出卖中国的真面目，已经暴露无遗。但是美帝与蒋贼灭亡中国的阴谋，必将为中国人民愤怒的铁拳所粉碎。连上海美人主办的密勒氏评论报于七月十九日当魏德迈来华时，即曾刊文指出对于帝国主义者“中国在过去已经证明是一块巨大的流沙。她的广大的人口与土地，不但曾经吞下了侵略者，而且也吞下了无量数的金钱。”美国远东问题专家拉铁摩尔还在今年六月二十四日，就曾著文警告说：“日本从芦沟桥上跌入中国的海洋，从此就被淹没再也无法爬出来了。”
