　　Relying on the Masses to Disperse and Ambush the Enemy
  　Ju'nan and Chengwu Persist in Enemy Rear Positions
    [Report from this newspaper in the JiluYu area on the 10th] During the recent "saw-tooth" situation in Henan, cadres in Ju'nan and Chengwu counties and districts dispersed and persisted alongside the masses, forming a mass-based guerrilla war. Before the enemy approached, the Ju'nan County Party Committee instructed all county cadres to disperse and persist locally, uniting with the masses to actively strike the enemy, opposing mere concealment without regard for the masses. The Chengwu County was responsible for holding nine villages. When the enemy entered a village, they dispersed out of the village, relying on sorghum fields and shrubbery for concealment, staying with the broad masses to monitor the enemy. Whenever an opportunity arose, they would capture enemy stragglers, strike and harass the enemy. When every village in the third district of Chengwu was occupied by the enemy, cadres led militia to move out at night, once ambushing the enemy three times in one night, preventing them from resting. Han Fugui, a cadre in the fourth district, led a work team to operate, capturing 21 enemy soldiers in ten days. The district secretary of Zhangfeng District in Ju'ye led a militia squad to ambush three groups of enemies two miles away from the enemy's main force, capturing a total of 28 enemy soldiers. Each district separately captured enemy stragglers, seizing many guns, ammunition, wires, and military supplies. As soon as the enemy left a village, they would enter the village to work, monitoring the enemy's actions. In Changyi and Nanlu districts of Ju'nan, and the third district of Chengwu, some bad landlords colluded with the Chiang bandits, committing atrocities. After our cadres entered the villages, they immediately suppressed them. The Chengwu Home-Returning Corps returned from Shanxian County, attempting to return to their villages and restore their rule, but upon returning halfway, hearing that our cadres were still persisting in the villages, they panicked and fled back to Shanxian County. Because the cadres relied on the masses, entering and leaving the villages with them, or convening small mass meetings to conduct propaganda, the masses remained highly confident in victory even during the most tense enemy situation, and work continued as usual without hindrance. In the Xulou and Cangji sub-districts of Chengwu, cadres and militia together carried guns to the fields for the autumn harvest, or protected the masses during the autumn harvest, continuing production as usual one or two miles away from the enemy. In villages such as Dongguantun in Ju'nan, as soon as the enemy left the village, the village would resume its activities, and each village would automatically prepare for war support and guarantee the supply of food to the troops. An intelligence network was universally organized among the masses, with mutual communication, enabling them to act boldly. The masses universally sheltered cadres and wounded soldiers, delivering water and food to them. The masses in each village also carried out anti-collaboration struggles. In Liuzhuang, Chengwu, when the enemy asked them for 20 catties of flour, they resolutely refused, vowing to rather die than give it to them. The women's chairman of Xulou was hung up and beaten to death by the enemy for not reporting the location of public grain. Liu Ba of the same village was beaten until his skin was torn, but still did not tell the enemy the truth, demonstrating a high degree of popular integrity. In Ju'nan and Chengwu, because the cadres believed in the masses and dared to rely on them to disperse and persist, mass-based guerrilla warfare became active.

　　依靠群众分散袭敌
  　钜南城武坚持敌后阵地
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】钜南、城武两县县区干部，在此次河南大拉锯形势中，与群众在一起分散坚持，形成群众性的游击战争。于敌人压境之前，钜南县委即指示全县干部，一律就地分散坚持，结合群众，积极予敌打击；反对单纯隐蔽不管群众。城武县负责坚持九个村庄，敌人进村，他们分头出村，在野外依靠高粱地灌木丛隐蔽，和广大群众在一起，监视敌人，一有机会，就捉敌散兵，打击和扰乱敌人。当城武三区村村有敌人时，干部带领民兵，夜间出动，一夜曾袭敌三次，使敌不能休息；四区区干韩富贵，带领工作小组活动，十天内俘敌二十一名。钜野章逢区区书带领民兵小组，在距敌大军二里路的地方，奇袭三股敌人，共俘敌廿八名。各区分别捕捉敌人散兵，缴获枪支子弹和电线及军用品甚多，敌人一出村，他们便进村工作，监视敌人行动。钜南昌邑、南鲁区及城武三区，曾有坏地主勾搭蒋匪，行凶作歹，我干部入村后，当即予以镇压。城武还乡团，从单县回来，企图回村复辟，但返至半途，闻我干部仍坚持在乡，惊慌之余，纷纷逃回单县去。由于干部依靠群众，同群众一起出村进村，或召集小型群众会，进行宣传，所以群众在敌情最紧张时，胜利信心仍然很高，工作也照常进行无阻。城武徐楼小区和仓集小区，干部和民兵在一起，背着枪下地秋收，或掩护群众秋收，在离敌一、二里地方，仍照常生产。钜南东官屯等村，敌人刚出村，村里就复查起来，各村并自动准备战勤和保证部队粮食的供给。在群众中普遍组织起情报网，互相通声气，因此能大胆活动。群众普遍掩护干部伤员，给干部伤员送水送饭。各村群众并进行了反维持斗争，城武刘庄，敌人向他们要廿斤面，他们坚决不给，大家发誓杀死也不给；徐楼妇女会长，被敌人吊打至死不报公粮地点，同村的刘坝，被打的皮开肉裂，仍不对敌说实话，表现高度的人民气节。钜南，城武由于干部相信群众，敢于依靠群众分散坚持，因此群众性游击战争活跃起来。
