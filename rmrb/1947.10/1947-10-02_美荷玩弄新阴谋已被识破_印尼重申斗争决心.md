　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. The Hague dispatch: According to a report in the Dutch newspaper "De Waarheid," despite the Security Council's ceasefire decision and repeated expressions from Sukarno and Sjahrir of their willingness to reopen negotiations, Dutch imperialism stubbornly persists in its sinister plot to destroy the Indonesian Republic. The newspaper pointed out that the tripartite "mediation" committee, led by the United States (United States, Belgium, Australia), is trying to pressure the Indonesian Republic and further force it to make concessions to the Dutch imperialists. U.S. imperialism has consistently supported the Dutch conspiracy to eliminate the Indonesian Republic and establish puppet regimes in various regions. The Indonesian Republic has fully recognized this sinister trick of the U.S. and the Netherlands. The Indonesian government issued a statement in Yogyakarta on the 23rd, reaffirming Indonesia's firm adherence to the principle of fighting for the complete independence of the nation. It also insisted that Dutch troops must withdraw to their original positions as of October 15, 1946 (the date of the Dutch-Indonesian ceasefire agreement). The safety of the Indonesian people's independence and liberation movement must be guaranteed. The statement also emphasized that the Indonesian Republic is willing to establish close and friendly relations with countries that recognize the fundamental rights of the Indonesian people by all means.

  　印尼重申斗争决心
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】海牙讯：据荷兰“德·瓦尔海德”报报导称：不顾安理会的停战决定，及苏加诺与沙利佛丁一再表示愿重开谈判，荷兰帝国主义顽固地坚持其摧毁印尼共和国之毒谋。该报指出：以美国为首的三国（美国、比利时、澳洲）“调停”委员会力图压迫印尼共和国，并进一步强制印尼共和国向荷兰帝国主义者让步。美帝国主义始终支持荷兰消灭印尼共和国及在各地建立傀儡政权之阴谋。印尼共和国已完全识破美荷此种险恶诡计，印尼政府特于二十三日在日惹发表声明重申印度尼西亚坚决遵守为国家之完全独立而斗争的原则。并坚持荷兰军队必须撤至一九四六年十月十五日（印荷签订休战协定之日期）之原来位置。印尼人民之独立解放运动之安全必须予以保障。该声明同时强调指出：印尼共和国愿以一切方法，与承认印尼人民基本权利之国家建立密切之友好关系。
