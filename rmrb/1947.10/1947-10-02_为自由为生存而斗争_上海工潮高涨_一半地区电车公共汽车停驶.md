　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th—According to various reports, the labor strikes in Shanghai are expanding fiercely. Following the strikes by employees of American and French-owned water and electricity companies for freedom and survival, workers at the British-owned tram company also began striking on the evening of the 28th in response. After the entire body of 3,000 drivers, conductors, and employees of the French-owned water and electricity company's tram and bus lines went on strike on the 27th, Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai Mayor Wu Jingzhen immediately threatened to take "drastic action" and arrest the workers. The Chiang-controlled Social Affairs Bureau also strictly limited the workers to resume work before the 30th, otherwise they would be treated as "voluntary resignation." However, the thousands of strikers were unmoved. After learning that the authorities were going to take bloody measures of arrest, the French Electricity Company's Trade Union held an all-night meeting on the 27th to discuss countermeasures. A union spokesman announced that if any member of the union was arrested, all workers would demand to be imprisoned at the same time; unless their demands for a 15 yuan base salary increase and a 500,000 yuan loan are met, they will never resume work. The entire city of Shanghai is now in a state of chaos. According to Reuters, tram and bus services in half of Shanghai were suspended on the 28th. According to the Associated Press, the transportation workers' strike may extend to the whole of Shanghai.

    【新华社陕北三十日电】据各方报导：上海工潮猛烈扩大中，继美商、法商各水电公司职工为自由、为生存罢工之后，英商电车公司工人亦于二十八日晚起开始罢工，以为响应。法商水电公司各路电车公共汽车全体司机售票员与雇员三千人于二十七日罢工后，蒋匪上海市长吴进桢即威吓称：将采取“激烈行动”，逮捕工人。蒋记社会局亦严限工人于三十日前复工，否则以“自动退职论。”但数千罢工者不为所动，法电公司职工会在闻悉当局将采取逮捕之血腥手段后，于二十七日彻夜开会商讨应付办法。工会发言人宣布：如果工会中任何一个人被捕，则全体工人要求同时入狱；除非答应他们的增加十五元底薪与借贷五十万元的要求，则他们将决不复工。现整个上海已陷入混乱状态。据路透社称：二十八日全上海有一半地区的电车公共汽车停驶。另据美联社称：交通工人罢工可能扩及全上海。
