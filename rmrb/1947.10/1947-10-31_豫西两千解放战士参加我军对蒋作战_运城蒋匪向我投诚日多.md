　　Xinhua News Agency, E'Yu'Shaan, 29th: More than 2,200 Chiang soldiers liberated in western Henan have gone to the front lines to join the People's Liberation Army in combat. Among them are soldiers of the Luoyang Security Regiment, liberated in the battle of Shishantou crossing the river, most of whom were poor peasants forcibly conscripted by the Chiang bandits. Chiang soldiers liberated in Shanxian joined the People's Liberation Army and have already performed meritorious service in the battle to annihilate the 67th Brigade at Tiemen. Li Zonglin, a liberated soldier of the former 135th Brigade who joined the 3rd Company of a certain regiment, and Deputy Squad Leader Ma Shugui and others defended a mountain top in the Tiemen battle. The enemy launched seven consecutive assaults on the mountain top with superior firepower, but they were all repelled by them. Liang Haizhou, a liberated soldier who joined the 9th Company of a certain regiment, shot and killed four enemies by himself. He said, "My gun is now aimed at the real enemy."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 27th: More and more Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers trapped on the isolated island of Yuncheng are escaping and surrendering to us. Recently, Wang Tingzhen, the company commander of the 247th Regiment of the 83rd Brigade, defected to our area with his family. On the 9th, Zhao Zhiguo, deputy squad leader of the 7th Squad of the 1st Company of the 369th Regiment of the remnant 123rd Brigade, Wang Wenjun, squad leader of the 5th Squad of the 4th Company, and Li Liangfu, etc., of the machine gun company of the 3rd Battalion, collectively surrendered. It is said that prices in Yuncheng are rising several times a day. Cabbage has risen from 2,000 to 4,500 yuan per pound, and pork has risen from 7,000 to 20,000 yuan per pound. The soldiers' lives are miserable beyond description, and they privately discuss, "Why not surrender if we are suffering like this?!"

    【新华社鄂豫陕二十九日电】在豫西被解放之蒋军二千二百余人已开赴前线参加解放军作战。其中有石山头渡河之战中被解放的洛阳保安团士兵，大多是被蒋匪当局强迫抓来的贫苦农民。至在陕县解放的蒋军士兵参加解放军后，在铁门歼灭六十七旅战斗中已经立了功。参加某团三连的前一三五旅解放战士李宗林，在铁门战斗中和副班长马树贵等坚守山头，敌人挟优势火力向山头连冲七次，都被他们打垮了。参加某团九连的解放战士梁海洲独自射杀了四个敌人，他说：“我的枪口现在对准了真正的敌人。”
