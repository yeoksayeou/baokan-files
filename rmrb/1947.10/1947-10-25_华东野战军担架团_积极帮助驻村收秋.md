East China Field Army Stretcher-Bearer Regiment
　　Actively Helps Villages with Autumn Harvest
　　[This newspaper's report from Jilu豫 on the 23rd] The stretcher-bearer regiment of a certain unit of the East China Field Army has strengthened its relationship with the masses through assisting in the autumn harvest. After receiving the order to "organize all efforts to help the masses with the autumn harvest, reduce the burden on the masses, and seize the time to plant wheat," the regiment enthusiastically helped the masses in a certain village in their garrison area with the autumn harvest during their rest and study period. In one week, they helped the masses shell 637.3 mu of corn, pull 497.5 mu of mung beans, pull 359.5 mu of corn stalks, carry 750 loads of water, deliver 40 carts of manure, and also did a lot of other work such as plowing, bundling sorghum stalks, and threshing millet. When the stretcher-bearer regiment first arrived in the village, the relationship with the masses was not very close. After helping with the autumn harvest, the army and the people became like one family. For example, the comrades of the sixth squad of the second company of the sixth battalion, went to the fields to pull corn stalks during the day, and shelled corn with their landlords in the evening. Later, when Comrade Wang Xiude fell ill, the landlord took great care of him, and sent him water seven times in one night. The masses were still reluctant to let the regiment leave when they moved. In addition, lightly wounded soldiers from the 17th team of the 5th hospital of a certain unit's rear hospital, initiated a "Help and Love" campaign to save civilian labor and help the masses with harvesting and planting. The wounded soldiers voluntarily requested to get their own meals, without the need for civilian porters, and washed their own clothes without relying on women. They did whatever they could themselves. As a result, they first allowed 28 long-term civilian laborers to return home, and many comrades went to work with their injuries to help the masses with production, and in three days, they helped harvest 97 mu of crops.

　　华东野战军担架团
  　积极帮助驻村收秋
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】华东野战军某部担架团，助收中密切了群众关系。该团自接到“组织全力，帮助群众秋收，减轻群众负担，争取时间种上小麦”的通令后，即在休整学习中帮助驻地某村群众热烈秋收。一周时间，共帮助群众剥玉茭六百三十七．三亩，拔绿豆四百九十七．五亩，拔玉茭三百五十九．五亩，担水七百五十挑，送粪四十车，其他犁地、捆高粱秸、轧谷子等也做了很多。担架团刚驻到村里时，和群众关系不甚密切。经帮助秋收后，军民已如一家。如六营二连六班的同志，白天下地拔玉茭，晚上和房东在一块剥玉茭，后来王修德同志病了，房东非常热心照顾，一夜竟给王同志送了七次水。该团一直到移防时，群众还恋恋不舍。又某部后方医院第五院十七队轻伤员，为节省民力帮助群众收种，由支部发起，展开“助爱”运动。伤员自动要求打饭，不用民夫，洗衣服不用妇女，能干的活，自己干。于是首先使二十八个长备民夫回家，并且很多同志带伤下手，帮助群众生产，在三天中，帮助收割九十七亩庄稼。
