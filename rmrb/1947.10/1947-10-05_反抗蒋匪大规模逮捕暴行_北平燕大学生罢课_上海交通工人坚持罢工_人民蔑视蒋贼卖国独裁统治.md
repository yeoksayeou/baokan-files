Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities have again carried out mass arrest atrocities in Peking. The scope of the arrests has been wide. Yenching University has taken strike action to protest the arrest of students. A combined dispatch from the Associated Press and United Press in Peking on the 1st stated: the arrests were orchestrated by Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics." Those arrested included four students from Peking National University, one student from Yenching University, a number of employees from public utility agencies, and even Yu Xinqing, director of the political design committee of Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Baoding Pacification Headquarters, another important member under Sun Lianzhong, a bureau chief of the Chiang Kai-shek municipal government, and the wife of Mr. Yuan (transliteration)—the married daughter of Chen Bu Lei, a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee—were also arrested. This new wave of arrests is still ongoing. The Associated Press also revealed that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities' so-called "search for communists" is actually "dealing with liberals and other elements that Nanjing deems too independent." The Chiang Kai-shek bandit's arrest atrocities have aroused public outrage. All students of Peking Yenching University, disregarding the so-called "General Mobilization Order" previously issued by Chiang Kai-shek bandit (which stipulates the prohibition of strikes, etc.), have begun a two-day strike today to protest the arrest of students from their university. Students from various universities have posted slogans on campus condemning this Kuomintang secret service atrocity. Several professors from the Department of Economics of a certain university issued a fierce written statement, criticizing the Kuomintang's atrocities. The statement called on students to unite and expressed their willingness to stand with the students in resistance. Another professor openly denounced the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities' "arrests" as illegal. A responsible person from the North China Student Federation told a United Press reporter that the federation is planning to take action to protest the five students' being arrested; in addition to Yenching University, other universities in Peking are also considering strikes.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to various reports: some employees of the American-owned Shanghai Power Company, in protest against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities' arrest of their company's workers and in support of the striking workers of the French and British-owned water and electricity companies, have re-launched a strike on the 1st. However, the supply of electricity has not been cut off. At the same time, due to the Chiang Kai-shek government's arrest of ten members of the Third District Department Store Employees' Union, the union's employees are also brewing a strike. The strike by employees of the British-owned Tram Company is continuing. Although the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities' destruction and oppression of the striking masses are becoming increasingly bloody, and the Chiang Kai-shek police bureau has even announced that those who refuse to return to work will be "executed on the spot," as of the 1st, only 500 of the more than 3,000 employees of the French-owned Tram Company have been forced to return to work. A few sporadic buses and trams are running in the former French Concession area under the coercion and supervision of Chiang Kai-shek bandit police and secret agents. The Shanghai workers' strike movement, triggered by hunger, seems set to continue to develop.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. According to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on the 30th: Shanghai trade unionists told the Associated Press reporter that the Kuomintang is oppressing Shanghai trade unions that have not yet been controlled by the (Chiang) government. They pointed out that the (Chiang) government has already controlled the majority of Shanghai's trade unions and is now attempting to take over the remaining unions in order to prevent the kind of "general strike" that nearly broke out in early summer this year. To achieve this goal, Chiang Kai-shek bandits have labeled these union leaders as "communist elements" and offered "rewards" for their capture. Unionists said that many union leaders have been arrested, while others have gone into hiding to continue their work.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. According to various sources: the great strike of 6,000 workers of the Shanghai foreign-owned Tram Company and Bus Company is still continuing. "Shanghai spent the Mid-Autumn Festival with all trams and buses out of service" (Reuters). "Only the buses operated by the (Chiang) Municipal Public Utilities Bureau are still running" (Associated Press). The Chiang Kai-shek Shanghai municipal authorities are constantly threatening striking workers with "dismissal" and "arrest." Fifty striking employees of the French-owned Tram Company have been arrested, and the Chiang Kai-shek police bureau has shamelessly offered 100,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency as a reward for the capture of Ouyang Ren (transliteration), the leader of the striking workers of the French-owned Tram Company. However, the vast majority of striking workers despise this kind of threat and continue to persist in the strike, determined to achieve the goals of wage increases and the modification of the Chiang Kai-shek authorities' unreasonable September cost of living index regulations.

　　反抗蒋匪大规模逮捕暴行
  　北平燕大学生罢课
  　上海交通工人坚持罢工
    人民蔑视蒋贼卖国独裁统治
    【新华社陕北三日电】蒋匪当局又在北平进行大规模逮捕暴行，逮捕范围至今广泛，燕京大学已以罢课行动抗议学生被捕。综合美联合众两社北平一日消息称：逮捕主持者为蒋匪“调查统计局”，被捕者计有北平国立大学中四个学生，燕大一位同学，公用事业机关中若干雇员，甚至蒋匪保定绥署政治设计委员会主任余心清，及孙连仲部下另一要员，蒋记市政府某局局长及国民党中委陈布雷已婚的女儿——袁（译音）某之妻——亦在被捕之前。此一新的逮捕目前仍在进行。美联社并揭露，蒋匪当局所谓“搜捕共产党”，其实是“对付自由主义者及其他南京认为立场过于独立的分子”。蒋匪逮捕暴行，激起社会公愤，北平燕大全体学生，蔑视蒋匪前所颁布的所谓“总动员令”，（其中规定禁止罢课罢工等），已于今日开始罢课两日，抗议该校同学之被捕。各大学学生多在校园中张贴标语，谴责此一国民党特务暴行。某校经济系教授多人发表激烈书面声明，抨击国民党暴行，声明中呼吁学生团结起来，并表示他们将与学生站在一起进行反抗，另一教授公开斥责蒋匪当局“逮捕”之非法性。华北学联某负责人告合众社记者称：该会正计划以行动抗议五学生横遭逮捕；除燕大外，北平各大学亦正考虑罢课。
    【新华社陕北三日电】据各方报导：美商上海电力公司部分职工为抗议蒋匪当局逮捕该公司工友，及声援法商、英商水电公司罢工职工，一日起又重新发动罢工。但电的供应仍未断绝。同时，由于蒋匪政府又逮捕第三区百货商店店员工会的十个会员，该工会员工亦在酝酿罢工。英商电车公司职工罢工正在持续中。蒋匪当局对罢工群众之摧残与压迫虽愈趋血腥，蒋匪警局且宣布拒绝复工者将“就地枪决”，但至一日为止，法商电车公司职工三千余人中仅五百人被迫复工，稀稀拉拉的几辆公共汽车与电车在蒋匪警察与特务强制与监督下在前法租界地区行驶。为饥饿所迫而引起的上海工人罢工运动似将继续发展。
    【新华社陕北一日电】据美联社沪三十日讯：上海工会人士告美联社记者称：国民党正在压迫尚未被（蒋）政府控制的上海工会。他们指出：政府（蒋）已控制了上海的多数工会，现正试图包办其余工会，以阻止类如本年夏初险而爆发的那种“总罢工”，为达此目的蒋匪给这些工会领袖加上“共党分子”的罪名，“悬赏”捉拿他们。工会人士称：很多工会领袖已经被捕，而其他一些则隐藏起来，继续坚持工作。
    【新华社陕北一日电】据各方消息：上海外商电车公司与公共汽车公司六千工人大罢工仍在继续中。“上海在电车和公共汽车全部停驶中渡过中秋节”（路透社）。“只有（蒋）市府公用事业局所经营的汽车尚在行驶”（合众社）蒋记上海市当局对罢工工人不断以“开除”和“逮捕”相威胁，法商电车公司罢工雇员五十人已遭逮捕，蒋匪警局更无耻地以十万元蒋币悬赏缉拿法商电车公司罢工工人领袖欧阳仁（译音）。但广大罢工工人均蔑视此种威胁仍坚持罢工，非达增资及修改蒋匪当局不合理的九月份生活指数规定目的不可。
