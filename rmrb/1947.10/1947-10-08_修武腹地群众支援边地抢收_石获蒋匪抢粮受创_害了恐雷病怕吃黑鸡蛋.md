[Reported by this newspaper from Xiuwu] The masses in the second and third districts of Xiuwu enthusiastically support the autumn harvest in the border areas. The rice in Wuliyuan, Nanzhuang, and surrounding areas is ripe, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have come out to harass and plunder. Our local armed forces and militia have dealt them a heavy blow. More than 400 people from the second and third districts in the interior, in order to protect the autumn harvest in the border areas, prevent the enemy from robbing a single grain, and starve the enemy to death, brought dry food and firewood, and formed teams and groups to enthusiastically rush to Wuliyuan, Nanzhuang, and other areas. Regardless of the deep water and mud in the rice fields, they carried out the harvest with great energy, and in just two and a half days, they harvested more than 400 *shi* of rice. During the harvest, there was mutual competition, and many harvesting heroes emerged. For example, Niu Zhangcheng from Gudongyao carried five *da dou* (each *dou* is 20 *jin*) at a time, traveling 30 *li* back and forth, three times a day, becoming a model in the harvest. (Xian Mou)

[Reported by this newspaper from Huolu] Since the beginning of autumn, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Huolu city have cooperated with the returned landlord militias to organize fugitive households into raiding teams following the army, claiming to rob winter clothes and food. On the 11th, a battalion of the enemy from Nantongye, in coordination with the landlord militias and fugitive households, plundered in Sanzhai. The masses were extremely resentful and buried mines to protect the autumn harvest. On the 17th, the enemy again plundered Sanzhai and Liangjiazhuang. One enemy soldier was wounded by a landmine at Shangzhai and Jingtangtai. There was a mine in front of the entrance to the Liangjiazhuang. The enemies dared not enter the house, and used a two-zhang long pole to probe. Six explosions went off, scaring the enemies away. The masses happily said, "We benefited from the watchdog." The enemy is suffering from "thunderphobia" and said, "We are most afraid of going out and eating black eggs." Now, all the cadres and militia in our county are extending to the front to launch a blasting offensive.

[Another report] The masses in Wujiayao, Lijiazhuang, and other villages behind enemy lines in Huolu, unable to bear the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, formed groups and robbed the autumn harvest of the evil landlord Du Xiaowu, stealing the autumn harvest from twenty *mu* of land in the city in one night. The landlord combined with stubborn puppets and conscript teams to suppress the masses, who then turned into small groups and robbed grain ears, pulled dry grass, cut the enemy's telephone poles, and collected the enemy's electric light wires. Currently, the struggle between the masses and the local reactionaries for the autumn harvest is in full swing. (Xu Ting)

[Reported by this newspaper from Gaoyi] On the 15th of last month, more than 100 enemies from Yuanshi, carrying two machine guns, came to Beiyan to rob grain. The militia from our Dongxisi, Maxian, Niujiazhuang, and other thirteen villages immediately set out to support them, repelling the enemy. The enemy suffered more than ten casualties and abandoned six corpses. After the battle, a small joint defense meeting was held to summarize the experience of the battle and further realize the importance of protecting grain. Now, every night, there are ×× militia from Sanmaxian supporting the villages around Beiyan. Everyone has brought into play the experience of village tunnel warfare and launched a village tunnel defense war to attack the grain-robbing enemy and puppets.

    【本报修武讯】修武二、三区腹地群众，踊跃支援边地抢收。我五里源、南庄一带稻子已熟，蒋匪出来骚扰抢劫，我地方武装及民兵，曾予以痛击。我二、三区腹地群众四百余人为了保卫边地秋收，不让敌抢去一粒粮，困饿死敌人，乃随带干粮、烧柴，编成队与小组，踊跃奔赴五里源、南庄一带，不顾稻田水深泥泞，都很有劲的进行抢收，只二天半的时间，抢收回稻子四百余石。在抢收当中，互相竞赛，产生不少抢收英雄。如古洞窑牛张成一次扛五大斗（每斗二十斤）往返三十里地，每天扛三次，成为抢收中的模范。（宪谋）
    【本报获鹿讯】入秋以来，获鹿城内蒋匪配合还乡团组织逃亡户，编成随军抢掠队，扬言抢过冬衣服和食粮。十一号，南同冶敌一营，配合还乡团、逃亡户，在三寨抢掠。群众痛恨万分，乃纷纷埋雷，保卫秋收。十七号，敌人又向三寨、梁家庄抢掠，在上寨、井台上被地雷炸伤一名，到梁家庄门口上有雷，敌人不敢进家，用两丈长的杆子通，一通响了六个，吓得敌人没敢进家，仓惶撤走，群众高兴的说：“沾了看家狗的光”。敌人害了恐雷病说：“最怕出来吃了黑鸡蛋”。现我全县干部民兵，伸向前方，展开爆炸攻势。
    【又讯】获鹿武家窑、李家庄等敌后村群众，不堪蒋匪压榨，成群结伙，抢恶霸地主之秋，一夜即抢了城内恶霸地主杜小五二十亩地秋。地主结合顽伪、壮丁队镇压群众，群众即转为零星的小股，抢谷穗、拉干草，砍敌人的电线杆，收了敌人的电灯线。现群众与土顽的秋收争夺战，正在急烈斗争中。（绪亭）
    【本报高邑讯】上月十五日元氏敌人一百余携机枪二挺，到北岩抢粮，我东西寺、马闲、牛家庄等十三个村的民兵，马上出发支援，将敌打退，敌伤亡十余人，弃尸六个。战斗结束后，又召开小联防会议，总结了作战的经验，更进一步认识了保粮的重要，现在三马闲的民兵，每夜有××个，支援北岩一带的村庄，大家都发挥了地道村落战的经验，展开了村落地道保卫战，打击抢粮敌伪。
