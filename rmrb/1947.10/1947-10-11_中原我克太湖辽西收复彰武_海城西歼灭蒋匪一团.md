Xinhua News Agency, Central China, August 8th: After the Chiang army in Yanting (Yancheng) fled south on the 1st, the Chiang army's 102nd Brigade of the 4th Division along the Tong (Nantong) Yu (Ganyu) line at more than ten strongholds including Wuyou, Liuzhuang, Yixi, and Caoyan were also forced to flee south. Our army immediately recovered the entire area. Now the entire 300-li stretch of the Tongyu Highway from Funing in the north to Dongtai in the south is under our control.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 9th: General Lin Biao's army recaptured Zhangwu County (northwest of Shenyang) in Liaoxi on the 7th, annihilating a regiment of the Chiang's Provisional 57th Division (reorganized from a part of the former Dongbao), killing or wounding more than 1,000 enemy soldiers. This is another powerful clampdown by the Democratic Allied Army on the bandit nest of Shenyang. Zhangwu was occupied by Chiang's 13th Army in January of last year. It is the ninth county seat liberated by our autumn offensive.
