　　[Report from this newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 30th] The vast plains south of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region have yielded a bountiful harvest. The people are actively supporting the great counter-offensive. Areas such as Yunbei, Linze, Juancheng, and Yun (cheng)-Ju (ye) have been recovered by the People's Liberation Army. The masses are currently busy with the autumn harvest, and the threshing grounds in every village are piled high with millet and sorghum. This year's autumn harvest has increased grain production by more than double compared to previous years. For example, soybeans, which occupy a considerable planting area, were mostly flooded last year, yielding only one and a half dou per mu. This year, each mu can yield more than five dou (each dou is 30 jin). Last year, sorghum and millet yielded only about three dou per mu, while this year they can yield five dou to one shi. These areas have preliminarily implemented land reform, and poor peasants have obtained some land. Zhang Mingkui from Yingzi, Yunju Seventh District, said, "I was allocated three mu of land in the spring, and the millet I planted can yield six or seven bags." Xiao Qian, the village chief of Xiaozhuang in Linze First District, was allocated twenty mu of land. He happily said, "This year I planted three mu of sorghum, three mu of millet, three mu of sweet potatoes, six mu of beans, and also sesame, broomcorn millet... All the crops are growing well. In the past, when the land was in the hands of the landlords, no crops grew well. This year, we poor people planted and they grow so well. It's really Chairman Mao's blessing!" In the northern part of Xian in Linze County, which is a desert area that was silted up ten years ago when the Yellow River breached its dikes at Linpu, crops planted in these areas in the past were either flooded, drought-stricken, or blown away by the wind. This year's harvest is unprecedented since the breach. An old man, Peng, from Pengzhuang said, "Since the end of June, when the Liu-Deng army crossed the river and eliminated the enemy, the weather has been consistently favorable. Each rain was neither too heavy nor too light, and the land was neither drought-stricken nor waterlogged. Even the low-lying areas grew good crops. Now every family has food to eat, which is all thanks to Chairman Mao's blessing!" The people south of the Yellow River feel that the main reasons for being able to have sufficient food and clothing are: first, because land reform was implemented, and most of the masses were allocated land, they worked harder for themselves than they did for the landlords in the past; second, after the wheat harvest, the people's government led the rush to plant autumn seedlings. For example, in Juancheng County, all the sorghum was uprooted by the enemy, creating barren land. After we recovered it, we quickly led and organized the rush to cultivate, plant, and eliminate wasteland, and resolved the difficulties of seeds and livestock for the masses, and within four or five days, we rushed to plant more than three thousand hectares of wasteland; third, the guerrilla teams, working teams, and militia persisted in guerrilla warfare, protecting the maturity of the autumn seedlings, and various places resisted the enemy's orders to forcibly uproot the seedlings; fourth, the Yellow River dikes were initially repaired. The enemy repeatedly destroyed the dikes and dangerous works, but our government and the masses, disregarding the enemy's aircraft and the various obstructions and sabotage of the special agents, resolutely and quickly completed the dike restoration work. Therefore, the Yellow River's summer floods did not breach the dikes, protecting the interests of the people along the river. Recently, as our East China Army annihilated large numbers of Chiang bandits in Henan, in order to thoroughly protect the fruits they have gained, the people have actively supported the front line for the victory of the great counter-offensive. The young men went out with stretchers to guide the troops, and the women and elderly at home ground wheat and milled the newly harvested millet into rice, sending it to the front line for the comrades to eat. They said, "This year's harvest is good, we will definitely ensure that the comrades at the front have something to eat." In the guerrilla areas and border areas, the government, in coordination with the armed forces, resolutely cracked down on the "Homecoming Corps" and suppressed the bad landlords, putting forward the slogan: "We must ensure that the autumn grain is received by the masses!" and continue to implement land reform, mobilizing the masses to distribute land and grain.

　　冀鲁豫黄河南岸丰收农民热情支援大反攻
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日】黄河南岸广大平原上五谷丰收，人民积极支援大反攻，郓北、临泽、鄄城、郓（城）钜（野）等广大地区，先后为人民解放军所收复，群众现正忙于秋收，村村的场院上垛满了谷子高粱，今年的秋收比往年增产粮均在一倍以上，如占相当大播种面积的大豆，在去年多数被水淹，每亩只能收一斗半斗，今年每亩可收五斗以上（每斗三十斤），高粱谷子去年每亩只打三斗左右，今年可打五斗至一石，这些地区初步的实行了土地改革，贫农获得了部分土地，郓钜七区营子的张明魁说：“春天分了三亩地，种的谷子可打六七布袋。”临泽一区肖庄村长肖谦分得了二十亩土地，他高兴的说：“今年种了三亩高粱、三亩谷子、三亩红薯、六亩豆子，还有芝麻，黍子……啥庄稼都长的好，往年地在地主手里，啥庄稼都不好好长，今年咱穷人种了就长这样好，真是毛主席给的福啊！”在临泽县的北咸是十年前黄河从临濮决口淤塞过的沙漠地区，往年这些地方种上庄稼后，不是淹，就是旱，或者是被风刮死了，而今年的丰收，为决口以来所未有。彭庄的一位彭老伯说：“从六月底，刘邓大军过河消灭了敌人后，一向都是风调雨顺，每次的雨下的不大不小，地里没旱着也没涝着，高岗下凹都长了好庄稼，现在家家都有饭吃，这原是毛主席的洪福”！黄河南人民感到所以能丰衣足食的主要原因，有以下几点：第一是因实行了土改，大部分群众分得了土地，给自己种地比往年给地主种地用心；第二是因麦后人民政府领导了抢种秋苗，比如鄄城全县高粱全为敌人拔除，形成赤地地里，我收复后，即迅速领导组织了抢耕、抢种、消灭荒地，给群众解除了种子、畜力的困难，于四、五天内抢种荒地三千余顷；第三是游击队、武工队、民兵等坚持了游击战争，保护了秋苗的成熟，各地都反抗了敌人强迫拔苗的命令；第四是因初步修复了黄河大堤，敌人一再破坏河堤及险工，但我政府及群众曾不顾敌人的飞机与特务的种种阻击、破坏，坚决迅速的完成复堤工作，因此黄河伏泛没有决口，保卫了沿河人民的利益。最近当我华东大军在河南大量消灭蒋匪之际，人民为了彻底保卫已得之果实，均积极的为大反攻胜利支援前线，壮年们出担架去部队带路，妇女、老年在家磨麦和把刚收下的谷子碾成米，送到前线给同志们吃，他们说：“今年收成好，我们一定保证前方同志有的吃。”在游击区和边沿区，政府配合武装，坚决打击“还乡团”和镇压了坏地主，提出：“一定保证把秋粮收到群众手里！”并继续实行土改，发动群众分地分粮。
