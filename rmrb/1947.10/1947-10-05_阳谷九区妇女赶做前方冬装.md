　　【Jilu Yu Daily Telegram】The autumn wind is getting chilly, and women in various villages in Yanggu Ninth District have launched a campaign to make winter clothing for the soldiers at the front. Bai Yunping and nine other women from Fangzhuang in the Third District made 100 sets of cotton clothing in eight days. Little Xiang's mother, who is 47 years old, not only finished making her assigned military uniforms but also actively helped others. Sometimes she was so busy she didn't even eat, saying, "The soldiers at the front are counterattacking, and clothing is urgent. It doesn't matter if I eat later!" Women's Director Yang Xiuzhen checks on the cotton clothing production every day, encouraging everyone's enthusiasm. If a woman runs out of thread, she takes out her own thread for everyone to use. Qiao Yulan, the 55-year-old women's group leader from Ji Wangzhuang, carries military uniforms back and forth on the muddy streets. The women of Yangdian, in order to make the uniforms sturdy and comfortable for the soldiers at the front, sewed each military jacket with twenty-two rows of stitches, some even with twenty-four rows.
    【Taiyue Daily Telegram】Peasants in Changzi who have turned over are enthusiastically supporting the counterattack on the front lines. After the news came that the democratic government was sending vehicles to deliver cotton clothing to the soldiers at the front, peasants from all over rushed to the village office to sign up. The fifteen carts in Yushui Village had their livestock fed in the middle of the night, waiting until dawn. In just two days, all of the county's four hundred carts and five hundred civilian laborers were gathered and, full of enthusiasm, set off on the 18th to "deliver winter clothing to the soldiers at the front." In addition, the militia has organized a long-distance rotation combat team, preparing to depart and currently intensifying their military training. Chen Changhou, a militiaman from Xihan Village, said, "Next time, we will cross the Yellow River to counterattack against old Chiang!" Women everywhere are rushing to make cotton clothing, shoes, and socks for their husbands or sons fighting on the front lines. Li Xiaopang, a peasant from Bi Village who had turned over, went specifically to the Fengbo Mountain fair to buy a new carrying pole and new hemp rope, saying, "From now on, I will carry more during corvee labor than before!" Doctors throughout the county have organized a front-line service team, equipped with medicine kits and medical supplies. The entire county is now fully prepared, just waiting for orders to depart immediately.
