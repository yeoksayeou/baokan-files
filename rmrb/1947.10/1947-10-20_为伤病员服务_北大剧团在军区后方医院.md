Serving the Wounded and Sick
　　——The Peking University Drama Troupe at the Military Region Rear Hospital
　　Guang Weiran
　　The Peking University College of Arts (formerly the Arts Research Office) was established only a year ago. Eighty percent of the students are intellectuals who came from elsewhere after the victory against Japan, and none of them have engaged in professional artistic activities. However, in this year, they have made significant progress both in ideological transformation and in their professional skills. In particular, their work at the military region rear hospital has demonstrated a high degree of work enthusiasm and a selfless spirit of serving the wounded and sick. We would like to express our respect and condolences to them here.
　　The author of this article is Comrade Guang Weiran, director of the College of Arts. The article puts forward many valuable experiences. In today's great counter-offensive, these experiences have a more urgent practical value. Some of these points, we believe, are also worth the reference and study of comrades working in hospitals!

　　To the Rear Hospital
　　The Peking University Drama Troupe, temporarily formed by more than 70 teachers and students from the Peking University College of Arts, went to work at the military region rear hospital in early July. The comrades gladly accepted this task. After a tense and pleasant marching life, and holding three public performances in × location, they arrived at the military region rear hospital on July 18. After discussing the overall work plan with the general hospital and responsible comrades, they immediately started working, holding two comfort performances for the masses where the general hospital was located, and then marching to the Fifth Branch Hospital to hold three public performances. Then, on August 1, they marched to the Second Branch Hospital to accept further work tasks.
　　At that time, the Liu-Deng army had crossed the river for a month and had fought several brilliant annihilation battles. A large number of wounded and sick soldiers were about to be transferred to the rear hospital, and mainly concentrated in the Second Branch Hospital. Welcoming the newly arrived wounded and sick soldiers, and welcoming this unprecedentedly heavy task, was a problem that the responsible comrades of the Second Branch Hospital were both excited and distressed about; the reason why we specifically chose the Second Branch Hospital as the focus of our work at this stage was also because of this.

　　Comforting the Resting Troops
　　Before the new wounded and sick soldiers arrived, we took advantage of the gaps to hold three comfort performances for the recuperating troops of the Second and Third Columns stationed near the Second Branch Hospital. We performed large and small operas such as "The White Haired Girl," "Zhou Zishan," "Brothers Enlist," "A Letter of Peace from Home," "Reporting Good News," "Glorious Flower," "Herding Pigs," etc. The soldiers believed that the content of our performances was realistic, and under the leadership of political workers, they made detailed discussions on the content of each play. In a letter written to us by the Third Column in the name of all the recuperating soldiers, it said: "We have recently watched your performances and have not only received spiritual comfort, but also received great enlightenment in class consciousness..."
　　In addition to performing plays, we also held two small-scale music concerts in the recuperating company of the Third Column, and went down to the squads and platoons to comfort them, listen to their stories of killing enemies at the front, and tell them about the recent activities of the masses in their hometown - the Taihang Mountains.

　　Welcoming the New Wounded and Sick Soldiers
　　On August 9, we divided the entire troupe into five detachments and dispersed them to the five units of the Second Branch Hospital to welcome the wounded and sick soldiers and assist in the large-scale reception work. Each detachment consisted of about twelve or thirteen people, including students from the drama, music, literature, and art groups, led by cadres, and arrived at each unit on the same day. Their tasks were: to stabilize the emotions of the wounded and sick soldiers, to encourage the emotions of the staff, and to promote new surgical treatments. Another central group was stationed near the hospital headquarters, responsible for liaison and exchange of experiences between the detachments, and responsible for publishing a mimeographed three-day "Glory Report" to report on the overall situation of the hospital and promote the merit-making movement in the entire branch hospital.
　　After arriving at each unit, the detachments immediately organized a joint party with the staff of the unit, and held a forum with the responsible comrades, in order to connect feelings and plan work. The detachment comrades also helped the unit adjust the relationship between the army and the people, develop villages, open up wards, borrow door panels, build beds, and clean the wards, and mobilize the masses to welcome the new wounded and sick soldiers. From the late night of the 10th, thousands of stretchers arrived at each unit one after another. For a time, gongs and drums were beating in all directions. The comrades of each detachment led the masses to welcome the wounded and sick soldiers, comfort the stretcher teams, assist in registration and investigation, accompany the new wounded soldiers into the wards, serve them with washing their faces and drinking water, introduce them to the hospital situation, explain the hospital rules, recite welcome clappers, sing welcome songs, and sincerely convey the care and respect of the people in the rear, so that the wounded and sick soldier comrades who had been transferred from hundreds of miles away with trauma were given preliminary comfort.

　　A Tense and Busy Week
　　Such a large-scale reception work was unprecedented in the hospital, and we lacked experience and did not know how to start. But that was only for a very short day or two. Soon, the comrades turned to heavy nursing work. Our male and female comrades washed the faces and bodies of the wounded and sick soldiers, fed them water and food, carried their excrement and urine, washed their blood-stained clothes, wrote letters home, read newspapers, and served them earnestly, comforting them; making many wounded and sick soldier comrades moved to tears.
　　In our daily contact with the wounded and sick soldiers, we discovered the meritorious people, heroes, cadres, and activists among them, which facilitated our assistance to the unit in carrying out the organizational work of the new wounded and sick soldiers. We assisted the unit or were entrusted by the unit to quickly establish the squad and platoon organizations in each unit and each village, and elected the economic committee, so that they could manage their own meals. A female actor independently completed such organizational work in a village without any help, which greatly surprised the responsible comrades of the hospital.
　　Promoting new surgical treatments was an urgent task during the large-scale reception period. In the past, new wounded soldiers found it difficult to accept. We composed new treatment clappers and songs, singing and explaining in the wards, and the wounded soldiers quickly accepted it. Dean Dai of the Second Hospital went down to the unit to inspect the work and found that only three wards stubbornly refused the new treatment. He felt very strange and asked only to learn that the three wards were located in remote areas and were difficult to find, so we had not been there.
　　Our indoor singing in each ward also achieved certain results. The content of the performances included clappers, songs, and even the full version of "The White Haired Girl" a cappella. The wounded soldiers said: "As long as we hear you sing, the wound will not hurt." So we held more than a hundred such performances in dozens of seriously ill wards, ranging from twenty minutes to one or two hours. Every time, we were held back and not allowed to leave. Our male and female comrades were also very enthusiastic, so that even the best voices were all hoarse.
　　I should emphasize that the hospital staff's enthusiasm for making merits is admirable. Their tasks were so heavy, and the manpower had not increased. Most of the staff could do the work of two people, and many of them were sick. Our "Glory Report" played a significant role in promoting the work competition in each unit. The enthusiasm of the staff of each unit of the hospital directly encouraged the enthusiasm of our detachment comrades; and the selfless enthusiasm of our male and female comrades, in turn, stimulated their emotions. This was the guarantee for the successful completion of this large-scale reception task.
　　The three major tasks assigned to us by the hospital were completed in the initial week due to the joint efforts of the staff and the comrades of our troupe. In the past, when new wounded and sick soldiers arrived at the hospital (the number of which was far less than this time), it usually took ten days and a half months to stabilize their emotions, while this time they generally stabilized within a week, and individual units within four or five days.

　　Small-Scale Theatrical Evening Parties
　　After the emotions of the wounded and sick soldiers stabilized, they urgently requested cultural entertainment. Indoor singing, teaching songs, reading newspapers, etc., could no longer meet their needs. Each detachment then arranged and rehearsed some short Yangko operas within their own capabilities, and successively organized evening parties in each unit and each village. There were not many students in our drama group. After being scattered to each detachment, each team could only perform with three, four, five or six people. Therefore, those studying literature and art participated in singing, and the few students in the music group were responsible for the band. In this way, the five detachments became five small drama troupes, competing to do their best. For example, among the twelve members of the Fifth Detachment, ten participated in the performance, but only four originally belonged to the drama group. They successively organized seven evening parties, each lasting an average of three hours, with about 400 viewers, and successively performed eleven short plays such as "Comforting Flower Drum," "Turn Over Flower Drum," "Reporting Good News," "Glorious Flower," "Coming to a Meeting," "Husband and Wife Literacy," "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland," "Brothers Enlisting," "Affectionate," and "A Letter of Peace from Home." The soldiers gave them a warm welcome.
　　At the same time, we also concentrated more actors to enrich the Third Detachment, and transferred them to the units of the Third Branch Hospital dozens of miles away to hold four larger-scale evening parties, performing operas such as "The White Haired Girl," with about 800 to 900 viewers each time.
　　The responsible comrades of the general hospital of the military region rear hospital wrote in a letter to Chairman Yang Rong: "The importance of cultural entertainment work is particularly obvious to some wounded and sick soldiers who have been groaning on the sickbed for a long time. Because in addition to eating and seeing a doctor, entertainment is their only major event. In the five months from February to June this year, the Fourth Unit of our Second Branch Hospital alone spent nearly one million yuan on "storytelling." - The five units of the Second Branch Hospital spent a total of 3.26 million yuan in eight months. This money was all drawn from the wounded and sick soldiers' own food expenses. These storytellers are some unreformed frivolous and licentious seventeen or eighteen-year-old, fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls or young women, or thirty-year-old hags; and their content is also filled with feudal, superstitious, degenerate, and corrupt toxins, such as the Peng Gong Case, the Peach Blossom Temple, the Oil Seller Occupies the Top Courtesan...etc. The hospital was opposed by the wounded and sick soldiers for stopping these things, and even had a big fight. The wounded soldier comrades said: We have to tell stories even if we don't eat, we have to tell stories even if we eat chaff! From here, we can see how urgently they need cultural entertainment, and it also shows the great significance of the Peking University comrades coming to work in the hospital."

　　Establishing Wounded and Sick Soldiers' Clubs
　　Our singing and theatrical performances were welcomed by the wounded and sick soldier comrades, which inspired their own interest and demand for cultural entertainment. This is very important: if we cannot help them establish their own cultural organizations and activities, even if our work achieves temporary results, when we leave, it will inevitably disappear like smoke, and they will either remain as lonely as before, or return to the influence of those feudal old artists.
　　We became friends with them, and quickly discovered comrades with more cultural and organizational talents among them. After a certain process of brewing and mobilizing, we finally established wounded and sick soldiers' clubs in each unit and each company one after another. In the units and villages of the Second Branch Hospital, we helped establish a total of twelve clubs. Although the activities of these clubs have their own characteristics, they generally include blackboard newspapers (or mass wall newspapers), radio stations, correspondence groups, singing teams (some include sight-singing groups), clapper teams, and Yangko teams (or drama troupes).... They generally have activities first, then organizations, so they will not become empty signboards. By the time we left, their own cultural and entertainment activities had gradually become enriched, and they even used their own organized evening parties to see us off. The experience of organizing wounded and sick soldiers' clubs will be introduced in a separate article, which will not be described in detail here.

　　Cultivating a Propaganda Team
　　In order to enable the hospital's cultural and entertainment activities to continue to persist and develop, we also took another step: accepting the commission of the general hospital and helping to cultivate a young propaganda team that had been established by the general hospital not long ago. The general hospital later said in a letter to Chairman Yang Rong: "Another major achievement of theirs is: we specially selected two cadres to train a propaganda team in our general hospital, which had just been established for only two months and had no foundation (not even a captain and political instructor), for twenty-three days. In just a few days, they actually laid a preliminary foundation in music and drama. In music, they generally learned sight-singing, four people learned to conduct, and erhu, sanxian, flute, percussion instruments, etc. can also be used in operas; in drama, they also learned a Yangko opera, a clapper opera (and two other short plays); other things include performance common sense, makeup, stage design, etc. They also trained a director, and also took five hours of classes on literary and artistic thought..."
　　We are now revising the various works created during our work in the hospital, and launching a creation movement, planning to compile a batch of scripts, songs, etc. that we may be able to create that are suitable for hospitals, into a set, and send them to the general hospital propaganda team and each wounded and sick soldier club as a small commemorative gift, and maintain regular contact with them.

　　Promoting the Merit-Making Movement of Wounded and Sick Soldiers
　　The last stage of our work in the hospital was to promote the merit-making movement of wounded and sick soldiers.
　　To promote the merit-making movement of wounded and sick soldiers during the recuperation period, we must first dispel their ideological concerns. They generally feel that making merit is still about going to the front to kill the enemy and make merit after they recover from their injuries. Recuperating in the rear is just recuperating. What merit should they make? Our method is to continuously put forward the slogan "Killing the enemy at the front is a hero, and recuperating in the rear is a model" through various processes of explanation and propaganda in the "Glory Report", and continuously commend outstanding model examples among the wounded and sick soldiers to stimulate their thoughts of making merit in the rear. Then, in individual units, we ask the heroes who killed the enemy to make typical reports. In individual units, we hold hero model gatherings, so that the heroes at the front and the models in the rear (including the recuperation models among the old wounded and sick soldiers and the models among the hospital staff) can exchange experiences and encourage each other. Then, we hold a merit-celebration meeting for the hero models at the front and the rear, and once again put forward the slogan "Killing the enemy at the front is a hero, and recuperating in the rear is a model" from the heroes' own mouths. Then, squads and squads, platoons and platoons, and companies and companies all set up merit-making plans and challenged each other, and a climax of the merit-making movement was set off. From then on, the wounded and sick soldiers automatically adjusted the relationship with the masses, automatically repaired bridges and roads, and in particular organized themselves to cut wheat and sorghum for the masses, becoming a temporary wave. These materials are vividly reflected in the "Glory Report".

　　The Role of the Glory Report
　　Our three-day "Glory Report" has been published for more than a dozen issues without interruption, and is still being published under the insistence of the hospital. Each issue has at least two pages and at most four pages, usually three pages, and each page can accommodate 3,000 words. This newspaper has almost become a clapper newspaper. Because 60% of the texts published are clappers, and the contributions from staff and wounded and sick soldiers are mostly clappers, and some news reports are also adapted into clappers by us.
　　The "Glory Report" is mainly about commendation, as the name suggests. As mentioned earlier, this newspaper has played a significant role in promoting the merit-making movement. Due to the establishment of wounded and sick soldiers' clubs and correspondence networks, the number of contributions from wounded and sick soldiers increased more and more. Unfortunately, the number of copies is limited and cannot reach the wounded and sick soldiers universally, so the role it plays among the soldiers is much smaller than among the staff.

　　What Have We Gained
　　The whole process of our work in the military region rear hospital was one and a half months, and the more in-depth work in the Second Branch Hospital was one month. In early September, we returned to Xingtai in batches, and the drama troupe was restored to the College of Arts.
　　What significant gains have we made from a month of more in-depth work with the wounded and sick soldiers? As the comrades of our Third Detachment summarized: The comrades have a more concrete understanding of how to serve the people, with what position, attitude, and style to serve, and laid the foundation for serving the people; they have a preliminary understanding of soldiers, including the emotions, life, and characteristics of the People's Liberation Army; they have tempered themselves in mass work, and have overcome the feelings and consciousness of petty-bourgeois intellectuals in certain aspects for a certain period of time, and have corrected their posture; the comrades have strengthened their understanding and unity; they have given full play to the strengths and enthusiasm of each individual; and they have clarified the mass line of literary and artistic work and the correct evaluation of literary and artistic work.... We will have another summary on the gains in ideological education in this stage, which will not be repeated here.

　　为伤病员服务
  　——北大剧团在军区后方医院
    光未然
    北大文艺学院（原为文艺研究室），自去年创办迄今，为时仅仅一年。其中学员百分之八十为抗战胜利后外来的知识分子。并且都没有从事过专业的文艺活动。但在这一年来，无论在思想改造上，在业务上，都有显著的进步。特别是最近在军区后方医院的工作期间，更表现了高度地工作热情，和为伤病员服务的忘我精神。我们特在此向他们致敬并表示慰问之忱。
    本文作者为文艺学院主任光未然同志，文中提出了很多宝贵的经验，在胜利的大反攻的今天，这些经验更有其迫切的现实价值。其中有些地方，我们认为同时值得医院工作同志的参考和研究！  
    编者
    到后方医院去
    北大艺术学院师生七十余人临时组成的北大剧团，于七月初到军区后方医院工作。同志们欣然接受了这个任务。经过紧张而愉快的行军生活，并在×地举行了三次公演后，于七月十八日到达军区后方医院。在总院和负责同志们商定了全盘的工作计划后；便马上展开工作，对总院所在地的群众举行了两次慰劳公演，又行军到第五分院举行了三次公演，然后于八月一日行军到第二分院，接受更进一步的工作任务。
    其时刘邓大军渡河已达一月，打了几次漂亮的歼灭战，大批的伤病员正要转移到后方医院，而且主要地集中到第二分院。迎接新来的伤病员，迎接这空前繁重的任务，是当时二分院的负责同志兴奋而又苦恼着的问题；我们所以特地选择了二分院当做我们这一阶段的工作重心，原因也在于此。
    慰问休息部队
    新伤病员到达之前，我们利用间隙先对驻在二分院附近的第二、三纵队的休养部队举行了三次慰问公演。演出了“白毛女”、“周子山”、“兄弟参军”、“平安家信”、“报喜”、“光荣花”、“赶猪”……等大小歌剧。战士们认为我们演出的内容是真实的，并在政工人员的领导下，对每一出戏的内容都作了详尽的讨论。以三纵队用全体休养员的名义写给我们的信上说：“我们最近看了你们的演出，不但在精神上得到安慰，同时在阶级觉悟上也得到很大的启发……。”
    演戏之外，我们还到三纵休养连举行了两次小型的音乐演奏会，并下到班排去慰问他们，听他们谈前方的杀敌故事，和把他们的家乡——太行山群众活动的近况告诉他们。
    迎接新伤病员
    八月九日，我们把全团分为五个分队，分散到二分院的五个所去迎接伤病员和协助大收容工作。每分队约十二、三人，包括戏、音、文、美各组的同学，由干部带领着当天到达了各所。他们的任务是：安定伤病员的情绪，鼓舞工作人员的情绪和宣传外科新疗法。另外一个中心组驻在院部附近，负责各分队之间的联络与交换经验，并负责出版一个油印的三日刊“光荣报”为的报导全院情况并借以推进全分院的立功运动。
    各分队到达各所后，马上和所部工作人员组织联欢晚会，和负责同志举行座谈会，借以联络感情和计划工作。分队同志还帮助所部调整军民关系，发展村落，开辟病房，借门板，搭床铺和打扫病房，并动员群众欢迎新伤病员。从十日深夜起，数千担架陆续到达各所，一时东西南北，锣鼓齐鸣，各分队同志带着群众欢迎伤病员，慰问担架队，协助登记调查，陪同新伤员进病房，服侍他们洗脸饮水，向他们介绍院况，解释院规，念欢迎快板，唱欢迎歌曲，诚挚地传达后方人民的关怀和敬意，使创痛在身由数百里外转移而来的伤病员同志们，得到了初步的安慰。
    紧张繁忙的一周间
    这样大规模的收容工作，在医院是空前的，我们更缺乏经验而不知如何下手。但那只是很短暂的一两天，马上同志们就转入到繁重的护理工作中。我们的男女同志替伤病员洗脸、洗澡、喂水、喂饭、端屎、端尿，洗血衣、写家信、读报纸，殷切地服侍他们，安慰他们；使得很多伤病员同志感动得流泪。
    我们在和伤病员的日常接触中，发现了他们中间的功臣、英雄、干部、积极分子，这就利于我们协助所部去进行新伤病员的组织工作。我们协助所部或受所部委托，把各所各村的班排组织很快地建立起来，选出了经委会，便于他们自己管理伙食。一位女演员在单人无助地情况下，在一个村里独立完成了这样地组织工作，使医院的负责同志们大大地惊讶了起来。
    宣传外科新疗法，是大收容期中的急务。过去新伤员很难接受。我们编了新疗法快板和歌曲，在病房里边唱边讲，伤员很快地接受了它。二院戴院长下到所部去检查工作，发现只有三个病房顽强地拒绝新疗法，觉得很奇怪，一问方知那三个病房地处偏远，很难发现，因此我们没有去过。
    我们在各病房的室内演唱也收到了一定的效果。演唱的内容包括快板、歌曲以至清唱“白毛女”全本。伤员们说：“只要听到你们唱，伤口便不痛了。”于是我们在数十个重病房共举行了百余次这样的演唱，短则二十分钟，长则一、二小时，每次总被拉住不放；我们的男女同志也是很热情的，以致最好的嗓子也都一个个唱哑了。
    我应该着重提出，医院工作人员的立功热情是使人敬佩的。他们的任务是如此繁重，而人手并未见增加，大多数的工作人员都能一人顶两个人干，其中还有许多带病的。我们的“光荣报”在推进各所的工作竞赛上，起了显著的作用。医院各所工作人员的热情，直接鼓励了我们分队同志的热情；而我们男女同志的忘我的热情，又转而激发了他们的情绪。这是此次大收容任务顺利完成的保证。
    医院交给我们的三大任务，由于工作人员和我团同志的共同努力，在最初一周间便完成了。过去新伤病员到达医院（其数远不及这次多），通常总要十天半月才能安定情绪，而这次普遍在一周内，个别的所在四五天内便安定下来了。
    小型的戏剧晚会
    伤病员情绪安定后，迫切地要求文化娱乐。室内演唱、教歌、读报等等，已不能满足他们的要求了。各分队便就本身能力之所及，排演一些短小的秧歌剧，在各所各村里相继组织晚会。我们戏剧组的同学不多，散到各分队之后，每队能演剧的不过三四个五六个不等；于是学文学美术的地参加演唱，音乐组的少数同学便负责乐队。这样五个分队竟变成五个小小的剧团，大家比赛着卖尽力气。如第五分队的十二个队员中，参加演剧的十人，而原属戏剧组的不过四人，竟先后组织晚会七次，每次时间平均三小时，观众约四百人，相继演出了：“慰问花鼓”“翻身花鼓”“报喜”“光荣花”“开会来”“夫妻识字”“兄妹开荒”“兄弟参军”“亲亲热热”“平安家信”等十一个短剧。战士们对他们报以热烈的欢迎。
    在同一时候，我们还集中了较多的演员充实了第三分队，调赴数十里外的第三分院各所举行了四次较大规模的晚会，演出了“白毛女”等歌剧，每次观众约八九百人。
    军区后方医院总院的负责同志写给杨戎主席的信上说：“文化娱乐工作的重要性，在一些长久辗转呻吟于病榻上的伤病员来说，特别看的明显。因为他们除了吃饭，看病以外，娱乐就是他们唯一的大事了。光我们二分院第四所在今年二月至六月的五个月中，只“说书”就花了将达一百万元。——二分院五个所，八个月来共花三百二十六万元，这些钱都是伤病员从自己的伙食费里抽出来的。这些说书人都是未经改造的一些风流淫荡的十七八、十五六的闺女或少妇，或三十来岁的徐娘；其内容也是充实了封建、迷信、堕落、腐化的毒素，如彭公案、桃花庵、卖油郎独占花魁……等。医院因为对这些事加以制止，还曾遭到伤病员的反对，甚至大打起来。伤兵员同志说：不吃饭也得说书，吃糠也得说书！从这里可以看到他们如何迫切地在需要着文化娱乐，也说明了北大同志们到医院来工作的重大意义。”
    建立伤病员的俱乐部
    我们的歌乐演唱和戏剧演出，得到了伤病员同志们的欢迎，这就启发了他们自己闹文娱的兴趣与要求。这是很重要的：倘使我们不能帮助他们建立自己的文娱组织与活动，即令我们的工作收到一时的成效，当我们走后，仍不免烟消云散，他们或仍枯寂如故，或仍然回到那些封建旧艺人的影响中去。
    我们和他们交成了朋友，便很快地从他们中间发现较有文娱才能和组织才能的同志，经过一定的酝酿发动的过程，终于把各所各连的伤病员俱乐部纷纷建立起来了，在二分院各所各村我们一共帮助建立了十二个俱乐部。这些俱乐部的活动虽各有特色，大体不外黑板报（或大众墙报）、广播台、通讯组、歌咏队（个别的包括视唱小组）、快板队、秧歌队（或剧团）……。它们一般地是先有活动，后有组织，因此便不会成为空招牌。到我们离开的时候，他们自己的文娱活动已经逐渐充实了，甚至用自己组织的晚会来欢送我们。关于组织伤病员俱乐部的经验，另有专文介绍，兹不详述。”
    培养了一个宣传队
    为了使医院的文娱活动能够继续坚持与发展，我们还采取了另一个步骤：接受总院的委托，带助培养总院成立未久的一个年轻的宣传队。在总院后来写给杨戎主席的信上这样说：“他们的另外一大成就是：我们总院刚成立起来才两个月的一个毫无基础（连队长及政指都没有）的宣传队，他们特地抽出两个干部给我们训练了二十三天。在短短的几天中，居然在音乐戏剧上都打下了初步的基础。音乐上一般都唱会了视唱，四个人学会了指挥，二胡、三弦、笛子、打击乐器等也都可以配戏了；戏剧上也学会了一个秧歌剧，一个快板剧（另外还有两个短剧）；其他还有表演常识，化装术、舞台布置等。又培养了一个导演，文艺思想上也上过了五个钟头的课……。”
    我们现在正在修改在医院工作期间创作的各种作品，并发动一次创作运动，打算把我们可能创作出来的一批适用于医院的剧本、歌曲之类，搞成一套，送给总院宣传队和各个伤病员俱乐部，当做一点小小的纪念性的礼物，并和他们经常保持联系。
    推动伤病员的立功运动
    我们在医院的最后一段工作，是推动了伤病员的立功运动。
    要推动伤病员在休养期中的立功运动，必须首先解除他们思想上的顾虑。他们一般地总觉得立功还是伤好了到前方去杀敌立功，在后方休养就是休养，还要立什么功？我们的办法是，通过各个过程的解释与宣传，不断地在“光荣报”上提出“前方杀敌是英雄，后方休养做模范”的口号，并不断地表扬伤病员中突出的模范事例，以激发其后方立功的思想。然后在个别的所，请杀敌英雄作典型报告，在个别的所，举行英模聚会，让前方英雄和后方模范（包括老伤病员中的休养模范和医院工作人员中的模范）交换经验，互相激励，然后举行前后方英雄模范的贺功大会，从英雄们自己嘴里再一次提出“前方杀敌是英雄，后方休养做模范”的口号。于是班与班，排与排，连与连纷纷订立功计划，纷纷互相挑战，立功运动的高潮便掀起来了。伤病员们从此自动地调整群众关系，自动地修桥补路，特别是组织起来给群众割麦，割高粱，成为一时的浪潮。这些材料在“光荣报”上都有生动的反映。
    光荣报的作用
    我们的“光荣报”三日刊，出了十几期，从未中断，现在还在院方坚持下继续出版。每期少则两版，多则四版，通常是三版，每版可容纳三千字。这个报纸，差不多变成了快板报。因为所刊登的文字，十分之六是快板，工作人员和伤病员的投稿以快板为多，有些消息通讯也被我们改编成为快板。
    “光荣报”顾名思义，主要的是表扬。前面说过，这个报纸在推动立功运动上，起了显著的效果。由于伤病员俱乐部和通讯网的建立，越到后来，伤病员的投稿越是多。可惜份数有限，不能普遍到达伤病员手中，所以在战士们中间起的作用，比起在工作人员中的作用要小得多。
    我们有些什么收获
    我们在军区后方医院工作的全过程是一个半月，在二分院较深入的工作是一个月。九月初间我们便分批回到邢台，由剧团复员为艺术学院了。
    一个月较深入的伤病员工作，对我们有些什么显著的收获呢？正如我三分队同志总结出来的：同志比较具体地了解了怎样为人民服务，以怎样的立场，态度，作风去服务，奠定了为人民服务的基础；初步地懂得了兵，认识了兵，包括士兵的情感，生活及人民解放军的特质；在群众工作中锻炼了自己，在一定期间，在若干方面克服了小资产阶级知识分子的感情与意识，端正了姿态；同志间加强了认识与团结；发挥了每一个人的特长与积极性；明确了文艺工作的群众路线和对文艺工作的正确估价……。关于这一阶段的思想教育方面的收获，我们将另有总结，兹不赘述。
    （此次工作尚未总结，本文只是简略的报导，批漏错讹之处，由作者个人负责。）
      十月一日于边府。
