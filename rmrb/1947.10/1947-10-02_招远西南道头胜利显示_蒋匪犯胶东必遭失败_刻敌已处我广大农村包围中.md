Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 30th. Frontline reporters from the branch agency recently issued an evaluation of the victory in the pursuit and blocking battle at Zhaoyuan (referring to our army's annihilation of 3,500 men belonging to the 8th and 9th Divisions in the blocking battle at Daotou Town, southwest of Zhaoyuan, on the 18th of this month) and the situation in Jiaodong, stating: Chiang's troops concentrated four reorganized divisions, advancing abreast and supporting each other, and invaded eastwards to the Daoyuan line on the 18th. The 166th Brigade of Chiang's 8th Reorganized Division was in the center, with the 9th Reorganized Division of Chiang's army, which boasted of being the main force for attacking Jiaodong, as a shield about 30 miles to its right in the area of Xiadian; about 20 miles to its left, the 103rd Brigade of the same division was backing it up on the Fengjia line north of Guzhai; and the area around Daoyuan, five or six miles west of the new district, was studded with Chiang's troops, forming mutually supporting positions. They were confident that such caution would allow them to avoid being struck. Unexpectedly, the People's Liberation Army's iron fist was so heavy that it annihilated three entire battalions of the 166th Brigade of Chiang's army in the center with a single blow. At 2 p.m. on the same day, the 9th Reorganized Division, which advanced to a point more than ten miles north of Xiadian, launched repeated assaults with two brigades and the strength of the 40th Regiment, but was repelled; its 103rd Brigade, attempting to move south to reinforce, was also severely attacked and scurried back wounded. This shows that the Jiaodong People's Liberation Army can block any strong enemy at any time and achieve victory.

Since August 30, Chiang Kai-shek bandits have used their 8th, 9th, 25th, and 54th reorganized divisions as the first-line force for frontal attacks on the Jiaodong Liberated Area, advancing abreast north along the Yantai-Yezhao line, the Changping-Pinglai line in the middle, and the Gaoping-Jiaoping-Yanqing lines in the south towards Pingdu, Zhaoyuan, Laiyang, and Yexian, encountering successive blocking actions by our troops and civilians along the way, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. As of the 18th, the Daoyuan blocking battle, a total of 7,700 invading enemies had been annihilated. Although the enemy has temporarily occupied the three empty cities of Pingdu, Yexian, and Laiyang, its vanguard has entered our hinterland, but its rear is empty. Except for a small number of battle lines occupied by a few of the enemy's troops, large areas of the countryside are still controlled by the military and civilians of the Liberated Area, who are attacking the enemy everywhere and posing a serious threat to Chiang's army's transportation. Although Chiang's army attempts to use its forces in the center to seek a decisive battle with the main force of the People's Liberation Army, it will have to divide its forces to defend under the constant encirclement and attacks of our military and civilians, making it impossible for the enemy to take care of both ends, which will be more conducive to the People's Liberation Army to annihilate the enemy at any time. Chiang's army, which has ventured deep into Jiaodong, will also follow the same path as Chiang's Hu army, which has sneaked into northern Shaanxi and cannot retreat. The battle of Daoyuan is the beginning of this fate for the enemy.

At present, the situation in Jiaodong is still at a tense juncture, but the military and civilians of Jiaodong are confident in overcoming temporary difficulties, transforming the current situation through continuous efforts to eliminate the enemy and strengthen themselves, until all invaders are completely eliminated.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 30th. Late news: After annihilating more than 3,000 enemies in the Daotou blocking battle, the Jiaodong People's Liberation Army actively withdrew from Zhaoyuan County on the 21st.

Another dispatch: The Binhai People's Liberation Army actively withdrew from Juxian County on the 22nd. The next day, the city was occupied by the 83rd and 28th Reorganized Divisions of Chiang's army, which had fled south from Zhucheng.

　　招远西南道头胜利显示
  　蒋匪犯胶东必遭失败
  　刻敌已处我广大农村包围中
    【新华社山东三十日电】分社前线记者顷就招远追击胜利阻击战（按我军于本月十八日在招远西南之道头镇阻击战中歼灭第八、九两师所属三千五百人）与胶东形势发表评价称：蒋军集中四个整编师齐头并进，相互拱援，于十八日东犯至道远一线。蒋军整八师一六六旅为中央，其右翼三十余里处下店一带，即有自吹为进攻胶东主力的蒋军整九师为屏障；左翼二十余里处古宅以北冯家一线，则有其本师一○三旅在背靠；面道远以西周围五、六里新区，蒋军队是星罗棋布；互成犄角。满以为如此小心总可以免遭打击。却不料解放军的铁拳是如此沉重，当头一击，中路蒋军一六六旅的三个整营即被全歼。同日下午二时，向下店北十余里处进犯之整九师，挟两旅四十团之众，反复冲锋数次，均被击退；其一○三旅妄图南下增援，亦遭痛击，负创回窜。这说明胶东解放军可随时阻击任何强敌，并取得胜利。
    自八月三十日起蒋匪以其第八、第九、二十五、五十四共四个整编师为正面进攻胶东解放区之第一线兵力，北沿烟台、掖招、中沿昌平、平莱、掖莱南沿高平、胶平、烟青等公路，齐头向平（度）招（远）莱（阳）掖（县）进犯，沿途遭我军民节节阻击，予敌以重大损失。截至十八日道远阻击战止，已先后歼灭进犯我军七千七百之众。敌虽暂时侵占我平度、掖县、莱阳三个空城，其先头部队已进入我腹地，然其后方空虚，除少数战线为将军少数部队占据外，大片农村仍为解放区军民所控制，并到处打击敌人，给蒋军交通上给以严重威胁。蒋军虽企图当中使用兵力，寻求解放军主力决战，但在我军民处处包围打击下，将不得不分兵把守，使敌首尾不能相顾、那么能更利于我解放军随时歼灭敌人。冒险深入胶东之蒋军，亦将蹈窜入陕北之蒋胡军欲退不得之覆辙，道远一战，即是敌军这一命运的开始。
    目前胶东形势，仍然处在紧张的关头，但胶东军民的信心克服暂时的困难，从不断消灭敌人与壮大自己的努力中，转变目前的形势，直到全部消灭进犯者。
    【新华社山东三十日电】迟到消息：胶东解放军于道头阻击战中歼敌三千余后，于二十一日主动撤离招远县城。
    又讯：滨海解放军于二十二日主动撤出莒县城。次日该城为由诸城南窜之蒋军整编八十三师与二十八师所侵占。
