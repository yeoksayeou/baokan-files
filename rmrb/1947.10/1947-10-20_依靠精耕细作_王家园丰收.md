　　Relying on Intensive Farming
  　Wangjiayuan Achieves a Bumper Harvest
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 18th] Wangjiayuan Village in Qinyuan achieved a bumper harvest of all grains by relying on intensive farming. From October 7th to 12th, over five days, Wangjiayuan Village in Qinyuan had already completed the harvesting of all 419 mu of millet, over 300 mu of beans, over 200 mu of corn, and yams. While general areas experienced poor harvests, they achieved a bumper harvest. The more than 400 mu of land yielded more than 1,100 piles of millet. On average, each mu can yield about one dan, which is two dou more than in previous years. Wang Danian's three mu of land yielded 58 piles of millet, totaling six dan, averaging two shi per mu. The reason is that the village paid special attention to deep plowing and careful cultivation this year. For example, Wang Shuihou's two mu of land was originally assessed as lower-grade land, but due to abundant manure and careful hoeing, the two mu of corn yielded 1.5 dan.

　　依靠精耕细作
  　王家园丰收
    【本报太岳十八日电】沁源王家园村依靠精耕细作，五谷丰收。沁源王家园村于十月七日到十二日五天内，已将全村四百一十九亩谷，三百多亩豆子，二百多亩玉茭及山药全部收完。一般地区歉收，但他们却得到了丰收，四百余亩地就割了一千一百多个谷子，每亩平均约能打一大石，比往年多收二大斗，王大年的三亩地，割够五十八个谷子，共打六石，平均每亩两石收。原因是该村今年特别注意了深耕细作，比如王水厚的二亩地吧，原来评的是下等地，但由于粪多细锄，二亩玉茭竟打到石五斗。
