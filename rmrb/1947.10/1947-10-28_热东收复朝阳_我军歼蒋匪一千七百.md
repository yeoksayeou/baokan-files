    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 26th: The Jicha Rehe-Liaoning People's Liberation Army recaptured Chaoyang City on the Jin-Cheng Railway on the 23rd, annihilating one regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's Provisional 51st Division (reorganized from the Northeast Security Second District troops), and parts of Fu Zuoyi's Cavalry Third Army (composed of remnants of the Mongol traitor Li Shou-hsin and some puppet bandits), and six security police squadrons, totaling more than 1,700 people. After our army captured Jinlingsi (the junction of the Jin-Cheng Railway and the Beipiao branch line) on the 19th, it turned west, crossed the Daling River to the north on the 21st, and swept away the outposts and bunkers around Chaoyang. At 8:00 p.m. on the 22nd, it launched a general offensive against the enemy in Chaoyang. After a fierce battle overnight, it destroyed the city's strict and solid fortifications, and resolved the battle at 4:00 a.m. on the 23rd. Except for a small number of escapees, most of the defending enemies, the army headquarters, and six security police squadrons were annihilated. Preliminary statistics of the battle results: more than 570 officers and soldiers, including Fu Zuoyi's Cavalry Third Army Major General Chief of Staff Liu Yulin, were killed or wounded, and more than 1,180 officers and soldiers, including Cavalry Third Army Major News Office Director Wang Jiecun and Battalion Commander Jiang Xiaoming, were captured. Seven artillery pieces, 56 light and heavy machine guns, more than 870 long and short guns, more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 500 war horses were seized. Chaoyang is the fifteenth city recovered by us in the autumn offensive. Thus, the vast area of more than 500 li wide in the Rehe and Rehe-Liaoning border areas east of Pingquan and west of Yixian on the Jin-Cheng Railway has been completely connected.
