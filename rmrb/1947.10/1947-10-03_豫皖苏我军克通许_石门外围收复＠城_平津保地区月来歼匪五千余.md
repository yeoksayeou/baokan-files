[From Our Correspondent in the Yu-Wan-Su Region, Second Dispatch] On September 29th, our unit captured Tongxu. The battle began at 3:00 AM and ended at 6:00 AM. Two battalions of the Chiang puppet Henan Provincial Security Second Regiment and the Tongxu Security Regiment, totaling more than 700 men, were completely annihilated, with over 500 captured alive. More than ten light machine guns, two heavy machine guns, one mortar, and one radio station were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, First Dispatch: From the 24th to the 27th of last month, the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army once again recovered Luancheng and Fanshanbao, and captured Xiyoulou and other places more than ten miles north of Baoding. (1) The Chiang bandit's entire Sixth Division (originally the Third Army) Seventh Brigade (originally the Seventh Division), entrenched in Shijiazhuang, occupied Luancheng, southeast of Shijiazhuang, on the 20th of last month, in an attempt to seize grain and conscript soldiers. A unit of our Liberation Army counterattacked on the 24th and recovered the city, killing and wounding more than 50 Chiang bandits and capturing six pursuit guns. (2) On the 27th of last month, another unit of the Liberation Army, in one fell swoop, recovered Fanshanbao Mountain Town, sixty miles southeast of Zhangjiakou (note: this area was occupied by the Fu bandits on the 1st of last month), annihilating more than 200 puppet security team members. (3) More than 1,000 men from the puppet Liu Huanan's unit stationed in Baoding and the Qingyuan police brigade advanced towards Cangzhou in the Baoding North Liberated Area on the 25th of last month. They were routed by a unit of the Liberation Army, killing and wounding more than 100 enemy soldiers, including the deputy regimental commander. Our army also took advantage of the victory to recover Xibopo and other places more than ten miles north of Baoding. (4) When our army swept away enemy strongholds such as Shigezhuang on the outskirts of Laishui from the 6th to the 8th of last month, four entire platoons of more than 100 men from the Seventh Battalion of the 13th Regiment of the Fifth Division of the U.S.-equipped Ninety-fourth Army of the Chiang army stationed in Laishui Chengguan automatically laid down their arms on the battlefield and have safely arrived in our rear.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, First Dispatch: Frontline reporters report: In September, the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army successively launched victorious offensives in the Ping-Jin-Bao area towards the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, and north of the Daqing River, successively capturing important towns such as Xinzhen, Xiongxian, Qingxian, Songlindian, and Ziya, annihilating parts of the Chiang army's 16th Army, 62nd Army (originally reorganized divisions), and 94th Army, totaling more than 5,000 men. These victories completely shattered the Chiang clique's Beiping Pacification Headquarters' and Baoding Pacification Office's clamor of "ensuring the Ping-Jin-Bao area," severely impacting the 16th Army's incursions north of the Daqing River, and completely isolating Baoding, making it impossible to restore traffic between Ping and Bao. Under the continuous blows of the Liberation Army, Sun Lianzhong, in a state of panic, desperately redeployed his limited forces east and west, revealing his awkward situation. In late August and early September, when the northern section of the Pinghan Railway was under pressure, Sun Lianzhong urgently withdrew the 43rd Division of the 94th Army, which was encroaching on the Daqing River. However, after September, the Liberation Army successively captured Xinzhen and Xiongxian, crossing the Daqing River. Sun Lianzhong had no choice but to beg Chen Cheng for assistance, drawing the 54th Division of the 93rd Army from Jinzhou, and at the same time, biting the bullet, he extracted the 95th Division (originally belonging to the 62nd Army), a division directly under the Pacification Headquarters guarding Baoding, to provide eastern support in order to relieve the impending annihilation of the 16th Army. On the 24th, a part of the 62nd Army defending Ziya was again annihilated by the Liberation Army. For this small Ping-Jin-Bao area, Sun Lianzhong is unable to defend everywhere, and cannot attend to both ends. The Liberation Army, on the other hand, is galloping freely, maneuvering to strike the enemy. Under the circumstances of a major counteroffensive, the morale of the Liberation Army is growing stronger, and Sun Lianzhong's Ping-Jin-Bao defense will suffer even more powerful blows from the Liberation Army.

　　豫皖苏我军克通许
  　石门外围收复＠城
  　平津保地区月来歼匪五千余
    【本报豫皖苏二日电】我某部九月二十九日攻克通许，战斗自上午三时开始，六时结束，蒋伪河南省保安二团两个营及通许保安团共七百多人全部被歼灭，生俘五百余人，缴轻机枪十余挺，重机枪二挺，迫击炮一门，电台一部。
    【新华社晋察冀一日电】晋察冀人民解放军上月二十四日至二十七日再度收复栾城、矾山堡，并攻克保定北十余里之西右楼等地。（一）盘据石门之蒋匪整六师（原第三军）七旅（原第七师）一个团，于上月二十日，陷石门东南之栾城，企图抢粮、抓丁，我解放军一部于二十四日向其反击，当将该城收复，毙伤蒋匪五十余人，缴获追击炮六门。（二）上月二十七日另部解放军，一举收复张家口东南六十里之矾山堡山镇（按：该地系上月一日为傅匪侵占），歼伪保安队二百余人。（三）驻守保定之伪刘化南一部及清苑保警大队千余人，上月二十五日向保定北解放区沧州进犯，当被解放军某部击溃，毙伤敌副团长以下百余人，我军并乘胜收复保定以北十余里之西伯坡等地。（四）上月六日至八日，我军扫荡涞水外围史各庄等敌据点时，驻涞水城关之蒋军美械第九十四军五师十三团七营之四个整排百余人，于战场上自动放下武器，并已安抵我后方。
    【新华社晋察冀一日电】前线记者报导：九月晋察冀解放军曾先后在平、津、保地区向平汉北段、津浦北段及大清河北胜利出击，先后攻克新镇、雄县、青县及松林店、子牙等重镇，歼蒋军十六军、六二军（原整编师）、九四军各一部共五千余。这些胜利完全粉碎了蒋记北平行辕、保定绥远“确保平津保地区”的叫嚣，使其侵扰大清河北的十六军受到严重打击，并完全孤立保定，致平保交通仍无法恢复。在解放军连续打击下，手忙脚乱的孙连仲，将其仅有的兵力东调西援，窘态毕露。八月底九月初，平汉北段吃紧时，孙连仲急将侵扰大清河北的九四军四三师抽回。但九月后，解放大军又连克新镇、雄关，越过了大清河北，孙连仲只得乞援陈诚，从锦州抽来九三军的五四师，同时硬着头皮抽出守卫保定的绥署直属师九五师（原属六二军）东援，以解十六军的被歼厄运。二十四日子牙守敌六二军一部又被解放军歼灭了。对这狭小的平津保地区，孙连仲已防不胜防，首尾难顾。解放军则纵横驰骋，机动击敌。在大反攻形势下，解放军士气日盛，孙连仲的平津保防御，将遭受解放军更有力的打击。
