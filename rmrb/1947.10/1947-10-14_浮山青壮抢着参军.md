【Comprehensive Report】 At the enlistment mobilization meeting for Fushan County district cadres, cadres from the second, fourth, and fifth districts proposed competitive conditions to each other. The fifth district proposed seventy enlistees, while the second and fourth districts proposed ninety. Regarding the quality of enlistees, Party members, militia members, cadres, and association members accounted for one-third, with no diseases or political problems. The mobilization method followed the mass line, adhering to three "no's": (1) no coercion; (2) no bribery; (3) no wasting grain or money. If the task was not completed, they were willing to accept a "shame flag," and all cadres were highly motivated. In Nan@@ administrative village, Second District, during a vigorous enlistment meeting, instructor Song Shengwen took the lead in signing up, saying, "I owe my liberation to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. They saved me, so today I am determined to join the army." Others immediately said, "Your leg is bad, can you still do it?" "Don't underestimate my leg, even if you order me back, I won't come back." This ignited the enlistment enthusiasm of everyone present. In one day, Jia Fengying from Beijiaojiao sent her husband, Yang Jinyuan, to join the army. Yang Jinyuan also resolutely said, "After I join the army, I will kill all the Chiang-Yan troops, and then we will meet again!" Guo Jinzhong, sixty-two years old, from Bei@@, was also very happy after hearing the victory news at the meeting. He immediately went back to mobilize his fourth son, Guo Yongqin, to join the army. The situation became more and more enthusiastic, with everyone rushing to sign up. In three days, they completed ten enlistments, exceeding the task. In addition, Helu administrative village completed ten enlistments, and Mijiawan administrative village completed twenty-three enlistments. In the Fifth District, in order to eliminate the Chiang bandits as soon as possible, the masses rushed to sign up for the army. For example, Yangcunhe administrative village completed seventeen enlistments, Hancun administrative village completed fifteen enlistments, Hedi administrative village completed eleven enlistments, and Longwanggou administrative village completed twenty-one enlistments. The above totaled fifty-four enlistments, averaging one-third more than the task. Students of the Fifth Senior High School, in order to support the great counter-offensive, launched an enlistment upsurge at the current affairs discussion meeting of all teachers and students. During the discussion, self-reflection on thoughts and class standing was carried out. Zhang Cunlian and Chen Zuowen said, "I came to school because I was afraid of being drafted and being a soldier. Today, after thinking about it, what is the purpose of studying after all? What will I do if I don't work? This time I am determined to join the army and will not go home until I defeat the Chiang bandits!" Female student Yang Shuzhen said, "My hometown is Henan. I fled here and rented a few acres of land from others. The landlord took all the grain I harvested, and in the end, there was still nothing to eat, and my mother starved to death (started crying). Now I am determined to join the army to avenge my father and brother!" Wang Jiaxiao said, "Chiang bandit's 61st Army killed my uncle (cried), even though I am young, I have to join the army!" The meeting was extremely excited, with some people shedding tears of sympathy and others filled with anger. Then they all signed up, and immediately there were one hundred and forty-five enlistees. Based on the enlistment conditions and mass appraisal, Chen Zuowen and twelve others were selected to join the army, and they spontaneously wrote enlistment resolutions. Then they each wrote letters to notify their parents to come to the school and held a parents' meeting, personally mobilizing their parents to get them on board, and everyone was full of laughter. After the meeting, some parents gave their sons, sisters gave their brothers, younger sisters gave their older brothers, wives gave their husbands, and classmates gave their classmates, rushing to make counter-offensive clothes, shoes, socks, backpacks, etc., to dress up heroes for the battlefield. The Second, Fourth, and Sixth Senior High Schools are also in progress. (Taiyue Second Military Sub-district Mass Life News, Fushan New Rural News)
