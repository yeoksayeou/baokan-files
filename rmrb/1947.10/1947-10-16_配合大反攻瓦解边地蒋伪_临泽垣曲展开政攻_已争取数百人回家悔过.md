[Reported by this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 14th] Linze County, Jilu Yu, vigorously launched a political offensive, and fleeing landlords and the Home Returning Corps returned home to repent. In late August, the County Committee of Linze County clearly defined the policy of striving to disintegrate the fleeing landlords and the Home Returning Corps, and launched a strong political offensive. First, it promulgated five major policies towards the Home Returning Corps: (1) Those who are die-hard will be killed; (2) Those who return with weapons will be rewarded - those who revolt collectively will be given special preferential treatment, and the government will be responsible for settling their families; (3) Those who flee home to repent and start a new life will be treated leniently - the poor can be divided into land, grain, and houses; (4) Those who hand over their guns on the battlefield will not be killed, and those who are injured will be given medicine and their pockets will not be searched; (5) Those who secretly provide information and establish relationships will not be killed. According to this policy, different slogans were put forward for four types of people: (1) Welcome the basic masses who are forced or deceived to return home and live a good life! (2) Landlords who fled are allowed to return home to repent to the government and the masses and compensate for the losses of the masses. (3) Those who have committed crimes are also given a way to start anew, allowed to atone for their crimes by performing meritorious service, confess to the masses and apologize, and compensate for the losses of the masses. (4) Resolutely eliminate die-hard bad guys and hand them over to the masses for disposal. In the implementation, the propaganda offensive was combined with armed struggle, targeting and planning to crack down on the most heinous elements, striving to win over supporting elements, using various meetings for propaganda and printing and distributing letters to the Home Returning Corps and "insurance certificates" - on which was written "As a poor man, dying for Chiang, think about whether it is a grievance or not? Abandon darkness and turn to the light, return home and be reunited, save your life and protect your land for a great reunion!" imprinted with the seals of the county government and the county head, in addition, it also called for a "one-letter movement," with each cadre writing a letter to the Home Returning Corps. After a month of political offensive, more than a hundred members of the Home Returning Corps have returned home to repent. In the Second District, twenty-eight members of the Home Returning Corps repented in fourteen days. In Dalin Village, six of the eight who were in the Home Returning Corps have returned. Yu Mingde, the old traitor and village head of Xiyu Village in the First District, has also returned home. Six fleeing landlords from Gao Gai returned home one day and went to the district headquarters to repent together. The ten members of the Home Returning Corps in Zhanghekou repented. In Wang Yinzhuang, Li Huayuan, and other villages, a platoon of people in the Home Returning Corps were all captured in the Zheng Ying battle. After a public trial by the masses, their captain was shot, and the rest were released. Later, the enemy called them back several times, with both deception and threats, but they never went, and said: "The Eighth Route Army didn't kill me, you can kill me if you want!" This policy has now been warmly supported by the masses; however, those who are won over should be controlled and managed and educated, and suspicious elements should be monitored to prevent them from hiding and sabotaging.

[Reported by this newspaper, Taiyue, 14th] Yuanqu launched a political offensive and has successfully disintegrated more than two hundred members of Chiang Kai-shek's special service team and deceived masses. After the recovery of Yuanqu City, the Chiang Kai-shek special service team led by Liu Hanshan fled to Nanshan, and we immediately launched a political offensive against them. First, we held mass meetings in Wangmao Town, Liuzhuang Village, Hexi Village, and other places to publicize the victory of the great counter-offensive and the lenient policy. Then, we convened meetings with the families of stubborn puppets to explain that our army had won the great counter-offensive, Chiang Kai-shek bandits could never come again, and the Eighth Route Army had a lenient policy. As long as they could repent, they would definitely be treated leniently. Therefore, the families of the stubborn puppets passed this message to their sons and husbands; the peasants who had been deceived by the enemy all returned one after another. From August 24 to September 18, in more than twenty days, we won over six puppet military officers below the rank of battalion commander and platoon leader, more than twenty soldiers, eleven households of stubborn puppet families, and more than a hundred masses who had been deceived. After returning, the cadres immediately called them together for a meeting, let them compare the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, and recognize who their savior was and who their enemy was. They said: "When the enemy was here, there were 'five evils,' 'three don'ts,' and 'three ignores.' With the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, this troublesome hat can be taken off!"

　　配合大反攻瓦解边地蒋伪
  　临泽垣曲展开政攻
  　已争取数百人回家悔过
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】冀鲁豫临泽县大力开展了政治攻势，逃亡地主还乡团纷纷回家悔过。该县县委会于八月下旬即明确了对逃亡地主还乡团的争取瓦解方针，展开了强烈的政治攻势。首先颁布了对还乡团的五大政策：（一）死心塌地者杀；（二）携械来归者赏——集体反正者特别优待，政府负责安置其家属；（三）逃跑回家悔过自新者宽大处理——贫穷者可分地分粮分房子；（四）战场交枪者不杀，受伤者上药不搜腰包；（五）暗通情报建立关系者不杀。根据该政策，对四种人提出了不同的口号：（一）欢迎被迫被骗的基本群众回家过好日子！（二）允许逃亡地主回家向政府群众悔过赔偿群众损失。（三）对有罪恶的人也给以自新之路，允许带罪立功，将功折罪，向群众坦白赔情，赔偿群众损失。（四）死心塌地的坏蛋坚决消灭，交群众处理。在执行中，宣传攻势与武装斗争相结合，有目标、有计划的打击罪大恶极分子，争取支援分子，利用各种会议进行了宣传并印发了告还乡团书及“保险证”——上写“身为穷人死为蒋，想想冤枉不冤枉？弃暗投明回家转，保命保田大团圆！”印有县政府及县长的图章，此外并号召“一封信运动”，每个干部给还乡团写一封信。经一个月的政治攻势，还乡团回家悔过者已有百余。二区十四天就有二十八名还乡团悔过，大林庄八个当还乡团的已回来六个，一区西于庄老汉奸乡长于明德也已回家，高垓逃亡地主一天回来六个，一同到区部悔过；张河口还乡团十大悔过，王殷庄、李花园等村在还乡团的人有一个班在郑营战斗全部被俘，经群众公审枪毙其队长后，其余释放。后来敌人几次叫他们再回去，连欺骗带威胁，他们始终不去，并说：“八路军没杀了我，你要杀就杀呢！”现在这一政策已得到群众的热烈拥护；但对争取回来者应进行控制和管理教育，对可疑分子要给以监视，防其潜藏破坏。
    【本报太岳十四日电】垣曲展开政治攻势，已争取瓦解蒋记特务队及被骗群众二百余人。垣曲城收复后，蒋记特务刘汉山部即逃往南山，我即对其展开政治攻势，先在王茅镇、柳庄村、河西村等地召开群众大会，宣传大反攻胜利消息及宽大政策，随后又召集顽伪家属开会，说明我军大反攻胜利了，蒋匪决不能再来，八路军是宽大政策，只要能够悔过，一定能够宽大。于是顽伪家属把这消息传给他们的儿子，丈夫；被敌人骗走的农民都纷纷回来了。于八月二十四日到九月十八日二十多天中，争取营长、班长以下伪军官六名，士兵二十余名，顽伪家属十一户及被欺骗走的群众百余名。回来以后，干部马上召集他们开会，让他们把共产党、国民党对比了一下，认识谁是他们的救星，谁是他们的敌人。他们说：“敌人在时有‘五大恶’‘三不要’‘三不管’，八路军来这顶愁帽子可摘下了！”
