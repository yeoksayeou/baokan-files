(This report from our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu bureau on the 9th) The liberated peasants of Chiping in the Sixth District, under the demand to protect their land and lives, guaranteed 100% completion of their support-the-front and militia tasks, and received four commendations and material rewards from the Military Region (awarded six machine guns and two hundred rifles); all stretcher teams also completed over 95% of their tasks. In particular, all comrades of the county headquarters, under the leadership of Commander Cui Fangting, Deputy Commander Liu Ying, and Political Commissar Su Min, worked diligently to complete the glorious tasks of combining land redistribution review, wartime services, and production. The basic reason for completing the above tasks is that the leadership grasped the following three key aspects: First, this spring, with little rainfall, all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the county were organized, and under the slogan of "seizing the planting season," the masses in each village organized mutual aid in production, and set the following as model conditions: doing a good job in supporting the front, doing a good job in reviewing land redistribution, doing a good job in repairing river embankments, and combining production with seizing the planting season. As a result, while carrying out intense wartime services and river management work, the entire county eliminated all uncultivated land. Second, after the spring seedlings emerged, another call was made to "seize the cultivation" and "seize the weeding," to ensure that not a single piece of land was left uncultivated. For example, Comrade Chen Junying, director of the Women's Association of Zhouji Village in the Eighth District, led a women's team of ten people to weed 1,200 catties of grass in one day. Elementary school teacher Yu Yuansan led seventeen members of the Children's Corps to hoe 17 acres of land in four days. Women and children in Huzhuang worked together, picking over 17,000 catties of shepherd's purse in one day. Third, when there was continuous rain this summer, a call was made to "seize the rescue," and the leadership also paid attention to water drainage work, calling on "farmers all over the world to unite as one family; it is not good if anyone's crops are flooded!" The Pujigou Canal in the Eighth and Ninth Districts (a long-standing unresolved issue) was dredged, and the accumulated water was quickly drained. For the remaining low-lying areas where water could not be drained, the method of "consolidated fields" was implemented, with ditches dug around each piece of land to drain the water, sacrificing a small amount of autumn seedlings to save the majority of the crops. In this work, the Eighth District alone rescued over 300 acres of seedlings. In response to the above achievements in Chiping, the Sixth Commissioner's Office and the Command Headquarters issued a commendation and called on the entire district to learn from the county.

　　茌平参战四次得奖生产又受专署表扬
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】六分区茌平翻身农民，在保田保命的要求下，保证了支前、民兵百分之百的完成任务，并得到大军区的四次表扬和物质奖励（奖给机枪六挺、步枪二百支）；全部担架也百分之九十五以上的完成任务，特别是县指挥部全体同志们在指挥长崔芳亭、副指挥长刘影同志、政委苏民同志的领导下，百倍努力完成了复查、战勤、生产三大结合的光荣任务。能完成以上任务基本原因是领导上掌握了以下三个环节：第一、在雨水稀少的今春，全县劳动力与半劳力组织起来，在“抢种”的号召下，各村群众组织了生产互助，并定出各区支前作的好、复查查的好、修河堤修的好、结合生产抢种好为模范条件，结果在紧张的战勤、治河等工作中，同时全县消灭了熟荒；第二、春苗出齐后，又号召“抢耕”“抢锄”，保证不荒一分地，如八区周集村妇女会主任陈俊英同志，领着妇女小组十人，一天拔草一千二百斤，小学教员于元三，带着儿童团十七人，四天锄地一顷七十亩，胡庄妇女儿童齐下手，一天拔荠菜一万七千余斤；第三、今夏阴雨连绵时，又号召“抢救”，领导上并注意了顺水工作，号召“天下农民是一家，淹了谁的庄稼也不好！”把八、九区的普济沟（这是历年来未解决的悬案）挖通了，把积水很快的顺出去，剩余的洼地无法顺水，实行了“并田内”，把一方一方的地周围挑成水沟，放进水去，牺牲少数秋苗，救出大部庄稼，在这工作上，仅八区抢救苗地在三百余顷。对以上茌平的成绩，六专署与指挥部特通令表扬，并号召全分区向该县学习。
