    Jiluyu Folk Art Propaganda Team
    Popular Reception Along the Way

    [Our Dispatch] The Jiluyu Folk Art Propaganda Team (referred to as "Art Team") set off from the Jiluyu base on the 27th of last month for a long-distance propaganda tour, arriving in Wu'an on the 9th of this month. During the march, it adopted a positive and flexible propaganda method of "marching while propagandizing" and "singing wherever they go," organizing performances everywhere, and distributing "Letter to Fellow Practitioners from the Jiluyu Folk Artists' United Association" and "Directory of Folk Artists" along the way. In addition to formal performances, they also conducted decentralized activities and individual propaganda to the masses. They were warmly welcomed by the masses everywhere. Except for the minister, instructor, and other nine people, most of the others were folk artists who had just come from the countryside to participate in training without leaving production. They are divided into eleven groups including Zhui Zi (a type of storytelling with stringed instrument), Luo Zi (a type of opera), and music. They use various forms to publicize the victory of the People's Liberation Army's great counter-offensive and the peasants' struggle for emancipation. When performing in Wangfeng and Hancun, it happened to be the time when stretcher teams were passing by. The wounded and sick soldiers were very moved after hearing "Land Reform" and "Chiang Kai-shek's Ten Treacherous Articles," and expressed that they would go to the front line again as soon as they recovered. The stretcher bearers also bought many songbooks and portraits of Chairman Mao. In Handan City, they cooperated with the city's four theater troupes and teaching teams to conduct a large propaganda parade. There were more than 10,000 spectators. When they arrived in Wu'an, the whole city was a sensation, and most of the shops and markets stopped trading. Even second-hand clothing merchants carried their packages to watch. One audience member, after watching the film "Heroic Struggle for Eighteen Years," said: "When the cadres talked about the story of the 25,000-li Long March at the 'July 1st' meeting, we couldn't figure out what was going on. Today, after watching the new foreign film, we know how our Red Army climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed iron-chain bridges."

    The printing group helps the masses print portraits of Chairman Mao without charging any labor or material fees. Whenever they arrive in a place, they are surrounded by the masses, and the two of them are always too busy to print enough. In Wu'an, people even brought paper to the team headquarters to print at night. In Yetao Village alone, they printed more than 3,000 copies of portraits of various sizes. Whenever the painting group arrives, they quickly create wall paintings. In Yetao, they have already painted 23 large wall paintings, giving the streets a new look. Because their propaganda content is closely integrated with the current situation and the central work of the border area, and the forms are diverse, popular with the masses, and they can seize every opportunity to publicize, they are welcomed by the broad masses. In twenty days, a total of eleven formal performances were organized. The direct audience was about 70,000 to 80,000 people.

    Another gain in the work is that the transformed folk art and artists have been tested among the masses and have initially shown their propaganda power. The responsible comrades of the "Art Team" held seminars with local folk education hall and theater troupe cadres in Handan and Wu'an to solicit opinions from the local masses and introduce their own experiences, which aroused the attention of the masses and some local cadres to this work.

    冀鲁豫民间艺术宣传大队
    沿途宣传很受欢迎
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫民间艺术宣传大队（简称“艺大”）于上月二十七日从冀鲁豫驻地出发，作长途宣传，本月九日到达武安。在行军途中，采取了“一面行军，一面宣传”，“走到那里，唱到那里”的积极灵活的宣传方式，到处组织演出，并沿途散发“冀鲁豫民间艺人联合会告同行同业书，”与“民间艺人通讯录”。除正式演出外，还进行分散活动与群众作个别宣传。到处群众热烈欢迎。除部长指导员等九人外，其余大都是不脱离生产的刚从乡下来参加受训的民间艺人。分为坠子、落子、音乐等十一个小组。用各种不同的形式，宣传人民解放军大反攻的胜利，与农民的翻身斗争。在王奉、韩村演唱时，正逢担架队路过，伤病员们听了“土改”与“蒋介石卖国十条”等很是感动，表示伤好后马上再赴前线。担架队员也买了好多唱本与毛主席像。在邯郸市，配合该市四个剧团与教书队，作了宣传大游行。观众达万人以上。到武安时，全城轰动，商店市场大部停止交易，估衣商们也背着包袱赶来看。一个观众看了“英勇奋斗十八年”的片子说：“开‘七一’大会时，干部讲两万五千里长征的故事，咱搞不清是怎么回事，今天看了新洋片才知道我们的红军是怎样爬雪山过铁索桥了。”
    印刷组与群众代印毛主席像，不取丝毫手工费与材料费，每到一地，便被群众围住，两个人总是印不及。在武安时，晚上还有人拿着纸找到队部去印。在冶陶一村即印大小像三千余份。画工组走到一处，便赶紧搞墙画，在冶陶已画大幅墙画二十三幅，街面为之一新。因为他们宣传内容与目前时局及边区中心工作紧紧结合，在形式上作到了多种多样，为群众所喜闻乐见，又能抓紧每一时机宣传，所以得到广大群众欢迎。计二十天内，共组织正式演出十一次。直接观众约在七八万人。
    在工作上的另一收获，是在于经过改造的民间艺术与艺人，在群众中得到了考验，初步显示出它的宣传力量。“艺大”负责同志，在邯郸、武安两地，曾与当地民教馆、剧团干部开座谈会，征求当地群众意见，并介绍自己经验，引起群众与某些地方干部对这一工作的重视。（华含）
