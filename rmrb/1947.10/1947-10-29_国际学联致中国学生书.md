Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Delayed news: The International Student Union's Second Council Meeting, held in Prague in August concurrently with the Second Council Meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, issued a "Letter to Chinese Students." The full text is as follows:

　　Dear friends: The Council of the International Student Union, on the occasion of the Union's first anniversary and having just completed its Second Council Meeting, extends its respects to the Chinese students who are currently fighting to improve their living conditions and resist the repressive measures taken by the Kuomintang government!

　　In our current meeting, the Kuomintang government forced us to accept the so-called "Chinese University Student Union" as the Chinese delegation—which is now known to be a completely fabricated group. Obviously, its purpose is to prevent Chinese democratic students from contacting all democratic students in the world and to prevent world students from understanding the real situation of Chinese students.

　　The Council of the Student Union condemns this behavior of the Kuomintang government and declares that it will do everything possible to strengthen contact with Chinese democratic students in the future. This contact has already begun with the participation of your true representatives in the meeting.

　　This year, we have made contact with the true representatives of Chinese students for the first time. The Council meeting included representatives from the Preparatory Committee of the Student Union of the Liberated Areas and the Student Union of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Your representatives told us about the terrible living conditions of students in China (Kuomintang-controlled areas) today. Hunger is killing many of you, and most of you are suffering from malnutrition. You live in extreme poverty, and you encounter enormous economic difficulties due to the increase in tuition fees, meal costs, etc. But they also told us about your struggle against these adversities and the Kuomintang's various forces suppressing your activities; the massive demonstrations held in many parts of your country, and the cruelty of the military and police using weapons to injure and imprison students.

　　We have heard that the Kuomintang government is doing everything possible to stop the development of democratic student groups, but we firmly believe that your struggle will not stop until your minimum living rights have been obtained, the education system within your country has been completely democratized, and you have the right to form your own groups without interference from any authorities.

　　We also believe that you will continue to fight against the continued civil war. The civil war, which has continued after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, is causing enormous disasters in your country.

　　We call upon you, and encourage the students of your country to form a single, unified fighting group, and invite you to take your place among the world's democratic students in the International Student Union. We pledge to support your heroic struggle and, in particular, to do everything in our power to inform students around the world of your current situation.

　　　　Long live the solidarity of democratic students around the world!

　　　　　　　　　　International Student Union President Jörg Lehmann Secretary Thomas Martin

　　国际学联致中国学生书
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】迟到消息：今年八月间与世界民主青年联盟第二届理事会同时在布拉格举行之国际学联第二届理事会发表“致中国学生书”，全文如下：
    亲爱的朋友们：国际学联理事会，在学联成立一周年，刚完成其第二届理事会的时候，向目前正为改善其生活情况与反抗国民党政府所采取之压迫手段而奋斗的中国学生致敬！
    在我们目前的会议中，国民党政府强迫我们接受所谓“中国大学生联合会”为中国代表团——现在知道这是一个完全伪造的团体。很明显的，其目的在于阻止中国的民主学生与世界的一切民主学生取得联系，在于使世界学生不了解中国学生的真实情况。
    学联理事会谴责国民党政府的此种行为，并宣称：今后当竭尽一切力量增进与中国民主学生间的联系。此种联系已由于你们真正代表的参加会议而开始了。
    今年我们第一次与中国学生的真正代表取得联系。理事会议中，已有了解放区学生联合会筹委会及蒋管区学生联合会的代表。你们的代表告诉了我们，今天中国（蒋管区）学生可怕的生活情形，饥饿正在杀害你们许多人，你们当中的大部分正受营养不良的磨折，你们生活得十分穷苦，由于学费膳费等等的增加，使你们遭遇到巨大的经济困难。但是他们也告诉了你们反抗这些遭遇的奋斗方法，和国民党各种势力压迫你们活动的情形；在你们国家许多地方举行的庞大的示威游行，以及军警用武器杀伤及监禁学生的残酷。
    我们听说国民党政府正竭尽所能去制止民主学生团体的发展，但是我们深信除非你们最低条件的生活权利已经获得，你们国家内部的教育制度已经完全民主化，你们已经有权组成你们自己的团体，不受任何当局的干涉，否则你们的斗争是不会停止的。
    我们也相信你们将奋斗不息，反对继续内战。在抗日战争结束以后的内战，正在你们国家内造成巨大的灾难。
    我们呼吁你们，鼓舞你们国家的学生组成一个单一的统一的斗争团体，并且邀请你们在国际学联内的世界民主学生当中，就任你们的席位。我们立誓支持你们英勇进行的战斗，特别要尽我们的能力，把你们目前的情况，告诉全世界的学生。
    　　　全世界民主学生团结万岁！
    　　　　　　　　　国际学联主席约瑚格·鲁曼　秘书托马斯·马丁
