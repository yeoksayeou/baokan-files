　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Associated Press, Nanjing, 12th: A spokesman for the China Democratic League, Luo Longji, declared at a press conference: The Democratic League has formally lodged a serious protest with Chiang Kai-shek for the execution of Du Bin-cheng, the head of its Northwest General Branch, by the Xi'an Garrison Command. Luo stated that Du's murder was even more serious than the assassinations of Democratic League leaders Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo last July. The previous murders were carried out secretly by assassination, but this time the execution was carried out publicly by government officials (the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang).

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Combined reports from Reuters and United Press, Nanjing, 12th: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is attempting to "eliminate the Democratic League" through fascist arrests and massacres. Democratic League spokesman Luo Longji stated that "sufficient evidence has been obtained." Luo stated: "The Kuomintang headquarters issued instructions in mid-August (i.e., during the visit of bloodthirsty butcher Wedemeyer to China) to stop the activities of the Democratic League. Subsequently, a large number of Democratic League members were arrested in Shanghai, Hankou, and Beiping; recently, the Democratic League headquarters planned to hold a meeting to welcome the British Parliamentary delegation to China, but this was also prevented by the Kuomintang." According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 14th, Zhang Lan, chairman of the Democratic League, issued a statement regarding the murder of Mr. Du Bin-cheng, expressing "extreme grief and indignation" and pointing out that the Democratic League will denounce the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek government to all of China and the world. United Press reported that among the nineteen people executed in Xi'an at the same time as Du, another person, Wang Chubo (transliteration), head of the Northwest General Branch of the Democratic League was also among them.

　　蒋匪屠杀杜斌丞氏
  　民盟严重抗议
    【新华社陕北十三日电】美联社南京十二日讯：民主同盟发言人罗隆基在记者招待会宣称：民盟已为其西北总支部负责人杜斌丞被西安警备司令部枪毙，向蒋介石正式提出严重抗议。罗氏称：杜氏的被害，远比去年七月民盟领袖李公朴、闻一多被暗杀更为严重，那一次是用暗杀方式偷偷摸摸进行的，而这一次则由政府官吏（蒋家匪帮）公开执行处决。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合路透、合众社南京十二日消息：蒋家匪帮企图以法西斯逮捕屠杀“消灭民盟”，民盟发言人罗隆基表示“已获得充分证据”。罗氏称：“国民党总部曾于八月中旬（按即当血腥屠夫魏德迈访华期间）发出制止民盟活动的训令，随后民盟盟员在上海、汉口、北平大量被捕；最近民盟总部拟开会欢迎英国议会访华团，亦被国民党阻止”。另据塔斯社十四日南京电，民盟主席张澜对杜斌丞氏被害发表声明，表示“悲愤已极”，并指出民盟将向全中国及全世界控诉蒋介石政府罪行。合众社称：此次与杜氏同时在西安被害的十九人中，尚包括民盟西北总支部另一负责人王楚伯（译音）。
