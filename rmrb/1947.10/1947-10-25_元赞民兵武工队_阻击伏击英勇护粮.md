Yuanzan Militia Guerrilla Team
  　Heroically Protects Grain Through Blockades and Ambushes
    [This Newspaper Reports] On the 9th of this month, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops, combined with the Home Return Corps and Zhao Tong's puppet township special agents, totaling over 400 men, carrying over a dozen machine guns, over 300 laborers, and dozens of carts, attempted to reach villages along the borders of the fifth district of Yuanshi and the fourth district of Zanhuang to seize grain. At dawn, they surrounded the villages of San Su Yang and Pu Hong. After discovering this, our guerrilla team from the fourth district, in order to complete the task of protecting the grain, immediately and decisively inserted themselves east of Dong Su Yang village, intercepting the enemy on their return route. After the guerrilla team opened fire, the enemy, in a panic, attempted to flee. Our county defense militia from Pu Hong village took the opportunity to counterattack. When the enemy was caught in a pincer attack from the east and west by our militia from Pu Hong Shangxu Le and the guerrilla team from the fourth district, our militia from Pu Hong Shangxu Le charged directly into the west of Dong Su Yang village and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Hu Erhe, the director of the Pu Hong Militia, and militiamen Gu Zhuming, Bu Quanfu, and Hu Jinlu bravely seized enemy weapons. After an hour and a half of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered 15 confirmed casualties, and one puppet soldier and one fleeing landlord were captured. We seized one Type 38 rifle, over 70 rounds of ammunition, some grain, one cart, and several items of clothing and bedding. The enemy fled in disarray, and we suffered three wounded. To commend the victory of this battle, the county command decided to award each of the seven comrades who participated in the hand-to-hand combat with a merit, and a circular was issued for commendation.

    [This Newspaper Reports from Yuanshi] The militia of Wang Song and Da Kong villages in the sixth district have repeatedly defeated Wei bandit's grain seizures. The enemy attempted to retaliate. On the 10th of this month, the enemy, with 700 to 800 men, carrying machine guns and small cannons, surrounded our Da Kong militia fortifications. Our Da Kong and Nan Su militia, numbering over 20, firmly defended the fortifications and bunkers, repelling several enemy assaults from dawn until afternoon, killing and wounding 19 enemy soldiers. The enemy soaked cotton quilts and placed them on top of square tables, approaching close to the fortifications, digging through the houses. Under the intense cover of machine gun and small cannon fire, they used explosives to damage our fortifications. Our militia immediately retreated to the bunkers to persist. Fortunately, our reserve forces arrived in time, routing the enemy. None of our militia were injured or killed, and we obtained a box of explosives that the enemy had failed to take away. The next day (the 11th), the enemy again concentrated over a thousand troops, attempting to defeat our militia from Wang Song, Song Cao, and other villages, but were routed by a platoon of our village militia in coordination with troops. They wounded over a dozen enemy soldiers again, and the enemy was unable to enter the village.

    [Also Reported] The Yuanshi Fifth District Guerrilla Team ×× people, on the night of the third of this month, when it was so dark you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, vigilantly advanced to Baligou for an ambush. After 10 o'clock, a sound of dogs barking came from Yelutou. The guerrilla team leader immediately assembled the team and approached Yelutou, attacking the bandit troops in three directions. The enemy had robbed the masses of many things and were gathering to leave when one of our hand grenades landed in the bandit group. Then, all three routes attacked simultaneously, scattering the bandit troops all over the mountains. We intercepted three stolen cattle, one donkey, 150 catties of grain, as well as cotton, cotton clothing, packages, etc.
