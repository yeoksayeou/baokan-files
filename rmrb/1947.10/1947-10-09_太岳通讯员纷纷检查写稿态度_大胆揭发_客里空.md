　　[This newspaper Taiyue, 8th dispatch] Following the Taiyue Xinhua Daily's exposure of "empty talkers," various parties have begun to emphasize the work of the Party newspaper. In particular, many correspondents have preliminarily examined their own writing attitudes and exposed "empty talk" news of themselves and others. The Fourth Special District Correspondent Group's exposure was particularly thorough. Gao Hongji confessed that in order to get his articles published and become famous, he did not hesitate to distort the facts. In a letter to the editor published on December 9th of last year, regarding the article "How to Implement the System of Land to the Tiller," he wrote: "Xingshan's family in Yangcheng Yangpi River still lacks land. Can we allocate him more land? However, the cadres said: 'He is not enlightened. Isn't this a gift from the higher authorities to him?' This matter does not conform to the facts. Xingshan's family had already been allocated land at that time. Why did I distort the facts like this? Because the newspaper proposed 'leveling and making up for deficiencies' and distributing the fruits according to wealth, some comrades could not accept this new spirit. I thought that writing such an article would definitely be published. As a result, the newspaper published it, and the editor, based on this matter, proposed: 'This kind of cadre's handling of problems shows that they have not grasped the spirit of land to the tiller and do not have the patience to listen to the opinions of the masses. They should be persuaded and educated to seek improvement.' This made the cadres of the village very dissatisfied and raised objections to me, questioning cadre Ru Chunfang. At that time, I even explained, 'For research work, regardless of whether it is true or not.' For the sake of my own reputation, I disregarded the prestige of the Party newspaper, the discomfort of others, and, even more, affected the unity of cadres and the unity of farmers, making the relationship between cadres and the masses bad." Comrade Wang Liangzhi deeply examined himself, saying: "In order to become famous, so that others would know that I could write, I did not care whether it was true or not. I wrote as soon as I heard it, and I wrote as soon as I saw it. There are many 'empty talk' news stories in what I wrote. For example, in 1944, I wrote an article criticizing the disguised conscription in Shangwoquan, Qinshui. The village gave the new soldiers more than 10,000 yuan in travel expenses. In order to say it more seriously, I wrote it as more than 30,000 yuan. Twenty-six militiamen from Xiwencheng joined the army, and about twenty more signed up to supplement and expand the militia. This was said by the deputy director of the village's armed forces committee. I wrote it as soon as I heard it. At that time, I thought that twenty-six militiamen joined the army, and only twenty were expanding the militia, which was less than the number of those who joined the army, so I added ten more. Furthermore, the story of 'Li Huchen and his mother' joining the army, which I wrote in Jiyuan, was simply based on a conversation with Li Huchen. I wrote it without any investigation among the masses, and as a result, I wrote a backward mother as a progressive mother!" Comrade Hou Peishan also said: "Because I simply started from the perspective of getting published in the newspaper, I wrote about the conscription in the Second District of Qinshui the year before last, after hearing a sentence from the common people, and wrote that more than one hundred soldiers were written as more than seventy, which made the district and village cadres dissatisfied with the newspaper. Because I wanted to become famous, I was unwilling to exchange opinions and research with others in both interviews and writing, resulting in numerous errors." Wen Tianbao said: "I never want to write other people's names on my articles. I cannot let you share my credit, so I write quietly, and therefore I made mistakes. For example, when writing the article 'Fourth Special District Office Makes Meritorious Service' for the Taiyue Political Report, I wrote it myself without discussing it with everyone, which resulted in the fact that those who should have been commended were not commended, and those who should not have been commended were commended instead, which made everyone dissatisfied." Li Changyuan exposed two "empty talk" news stories of others. One was the article "Rock Mountain's Rush Harvest and Shangguan Zhongyou" written by Comrade Zhang Jin and published on page four of the Xinhua Daily on September 29th of last year. It contained: "The one-mile-long Rock Mountain Street has become quiet, with no one in sight. In the morning light, only the white smoke from the chimneys on the roofs floats above the village." Yangcheng burns smokeless coal and there is no smoke, so how can there be smoke? How can it be white? Among them, there is also a point: "The next day it rained, and Shangguan Tingkui's squad of thirty-six people still harvested thirty-six acres in the heavy rain." At that time, I was working in the village. In reality, only eight acres were harvested, exaggerating it by more than four times. The other was the report published in the Xinhua Daily on April 27th of this year: "Yangcheng Rock Mountain starts with breaking through Shangguan Tingkui's fear of wealth thinking to promote the whole village to boldly make money." The time was "mid-April" without adding "last year," which is inconsistent with the actual situation, because it was last year's event. The current Taiyue Xinhua Daily is trying to promote this movement.

　　太岳通讯员纷纷检查写稿态度
  　大胆揭发“客里空”
    【本报太岳八日电】太岳新华日报揭露“客里空”以后，即引起了各方对党报工作的重视，尤其是不少通讯员，初步检查了自己的写作态度，揭发了自己与别人的“客里空”新闻，其中以四专署通讯小组比较揭露的彻底，高鸿基检查出自己为登稿子出名，不惜歪曲了事实。去年十二月九日报载写给编辑的一封信：“如何贯彻实现耕者有其田”一稿中，说“阳城洋皮河兴善家地还少，是不是能分给他地？然干部说：‘他不觉悟，这不是上级恩赐他吗？’这件事与事实不符，兴善家当时已分到地了，我为什么要这样歪曲事实呢？因为报上提出‘填平补齐’，按贫富分果实，有些同志接受不了这种新的精神，我想写这样稿子，一定可以登出来，结果报上果然登出来了，编者并根据这件事提出：“这种干部处理问题，是没掌握了耕者有其田的精神，没耐心倾听群众意见，应经过说服教育，求得改进。”使该村干部看到了，当然十分不满，对我提意见，找干部茹春芳质问，当时我还解释说：“为研究工作，不管真实不真实。”我为了自己闹名誉，就不顾党报的威信，不顾别人的难受，更影响了干部的团结和农民的团结，使干群关系闹不好。“王亮之同志深刻检查自己说：‘为了出名，叫别人知道自己会写，就不管真实不真实，听了就写，一见就写，凡我写的，‘客里空’新闻很不少，如四四年写批评沁水上沃泉变相买兵一稿，该村给新战士送一万多元盘费，我为了说严重些，就写成三万多元。西文兴民兵参军廿六名，又有廿名左右报名补充扩大民兵，这是该村武委会副主任说的，我听了就写，当时我想参军民兵二十六人，扩大民兵才廿名，还没参军的多，就多加了十名。再如在济源写的‘李虎臣和他母亲’的参军故事稿，是单纯听了李虎臣谈了一下，再没在群众中调查便下手写，结果把个拉后腿的母亲写成了进步母亲！”侯培善同志也说：“由于我单纯从登报出发，前年在沁水写二区参军，听老百姓说了一句，便把一百多名参军写成七十多名，惹得区村干部对报纸不满，由于自己想出名的原因，无论采访写作，不愿和别人在一块交换意见互相研究，结果错误百出。”文天保同志说：“我写稿总不愿写上别人名字，我的功劳不能叫你沾上，因此就悄悄的写，也因此出了毛病。如给太岳政报写‘四专署机关立功’一稿，自己写了没和大家研究，便发生了该表扬的没表扬，不该表扬的反而表扬了，大家都不满。”李长远同志揭发了别人的两篇“客里空”新闻，一是去年九月二十九日新华日报四版登张瑾同志写的“岩山抢收和上官中有”一稿？内有：“一里长的岩山街，变的静悄悄的，看不到人影，晨曦里只见屋顶上的炊烟白茫茫的飘荡在村顶上。”阳城烧无烟煤，并没烟，那能有炊烟？如何能白茫茫呢？其中还有一点：“第二天落雨，上官廷魁分队三十六人，在大雨中仍抢收三十六亩。”当时，我在该村工作，实际上只抢收了八亩，夸大了四倍多。一是今年四月二十七日新华日报载挺英报导：“阳城岩山从突破上官廷魁怕富思想入手，推动全村大胆发财”，其时间为“四月中旬”，没加“去年”，就与实际不符，因为那是去年的事。现太岳新华日报，正设法推进这一运动。
