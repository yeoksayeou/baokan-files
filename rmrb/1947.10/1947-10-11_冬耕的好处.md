　　The Benefits of Winter Plowing
    Ma Lin
    After the autumn harvest, the next major task is winter plowing (autumn stubble turning). This is a preparatory step for spring plowing, and it is especially important in areas where insect pests have occurred. There are two different views on this matter in the countryside. One is "Children are born of parents, land is deeply plowed," and the other is "Autumn land not harrowed, unhappiness and trouble ensue." The former saying is correct. We advocate not only plowing but also plowing deeply and evenly. After plowing, do not harrow, leave it as it is through the winter. This has the following benefits:

    1.  Old stubble and weeds will turn into fertilizer in the soil after winter plowing.

    2.  Insect pests and weed roots will be frozen to death during the winter.

    3.  The upturned raw soil will turn into good soil after being exposed to wind, rain, and sunlight during the winter.

    4.  Winter snow is easily retained, increasing and preserving moisture. When spring arrives, the land is loose, moist, and free of weeds, saving a lot of labor and allowing for early crops. We disagree with "Autumn land not harrowed, unhappiness and trouble ensue," because this will lead to the opposite results. If you harrow, it's like telling the insect pests and weeds: "Hibernate! You're safe from the cold, I've covered you with a warm quilt!" As for not preserving moisture, that goes without saying. Autumn land must be plowed; without plowing, the soil becomes thinner and thinner, good land turns into bad land, crops have difficulty taking root, and weeds grow taller and taller. We hope that those who want to harvest more grain will follow this method.

　　冬耕的好处
    马琳
    秋收以后，紧接着要做的一件大工作，便是冬耕（秋垡茬）这是来年春耕的准备工作，尤其在发生过虫害的地区，更为要紧。关于这个问题，乡间流行着两种不同的说法，一是“儿是亲生的、地是深耕的”，又一种是“秋地不耢、不胜不闹”，前一种说法是对的，我们主张不但要耕，而且要耕的深深的，匀匀的，耕了以后不要耢，让它原封原样的过冬，这样做有以下几种好处：
    一、旧茬杂草经过冬耕就会在土里变成肥料。
    二、害虫宿根草经过冬季也会被冻死。
    三、翻起来的生土，经过冬季的风吹雨打日光晒能变成好土。
    四、冬季下的雪又刮不了，容易增加与保存水分，等到春季到来时，地又松又湿润，又没有杂草，少费很多工，还能种早庄稼。我们不同意，“秋地不耢不胜不闹”，因为这样会得到与上面相反的结果，如果耢，那就等于告诉害虫和杂草说：“你们冬眠吧！保险冻不着，我给你们盖了一层融和的被子呢！”至于不能保存水分，那就更不用说了。秋地一定要犁，不犁土越种越薄，好地会变成坏地，庄稼扎根困难，杂草却越长越高，希望愿意多打粮食的人，照这办法去作。
