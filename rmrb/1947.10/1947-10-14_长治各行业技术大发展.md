　　Great Technological Development in Various Industries in Changzhi
    [Our Dispatch] Changzhi City's various industries have seen significant development in production technology over the past year:

    I. Tool Modification: For example, Wang Liqing, a worker at the water company, created lead sheet replacements for rubber gaskets (for water pipe connections) and used lead melt to connect water pipes of different thicknesses, ensuring that the city's water supply was not affected by a lack of materials. The Xinhua Paper Mill recently researched and installed an electric millstone, saving nine animal power units per day. Wang Fengming, a knitting worker at Yihecheng Textile Factory, modified the vest machine, doubling production and eliminating holes in the finished product. Sun Gouhai, a carpenter worker in Nanshicao, successfully created a dry water mill (applying the principle of a water mill, with the upper stone stationary and the lower stone moving, using animal power instead of water power), grinding two market stones of wheat a day, more than twice the output of an ordinary mill.

    II. Breaking Old Practices, Saving Labor and Materials in Various Ways. The fur and leather industry, which occupies an important position in Changzhi, previously used cold vats for tanning, which took a month to tan one vat of goods and could only be done in hot weather. Now, the use of hot vats has been successfully tested (some also use horse manure vats), completing one vat of goods in just seven or eight days, and is no longer restricted by climate. The Ma Chouhai group in Lower West Street used last year's old tanning solution to tan 310 hides, saving five dou of millet and 195 jin of saltpeter. The Bianfu Porcelain Kiln, through collective research, changed the clumsy kiln to a fast kiln, loading 3,000 more pieces per kiln, saving over 10,000 jin of coal, shortening the time by four days, and reducing the scrap rate from 30% to 5%-10%.

    III. Taking Apprentices is the Most Glorious, Becoming a New Honor in Various Factories and Workshops in the City. Guo Fuze of Northwest Street single-handedly taught 34 women to weave in half a year. When Shen Erxi saw that an apprentice was unhappy, he tried to understand their thoughts and solve their ideological problems or practical difficulties. He said that if apprentices are not happy, they will not learn. Xiao worker Wang Bingren traveled two miles every day to guide saltpeter boiling, and taught everyone within a month. Learning technology also broke the jealous thinking such as "rivals in the same trade are enemies" and "those who sell lime can't stand those who sell white flour." For example, Tonglu Cheng Qianlei said, "When I see a colleague, I want to talk and learn a trick or two from them." Guo Weiquan of the Industrial Union Wood Factory said, "Technology is endless, you can't finish learning in one lifetime."

    All of these are important reasons why Changzhi's industries can save raw materials, reduce costs, increase output, and improve quality. (Xing Fu, Ke Ren)

　　长治各行业技术大发展
    【本报讯】长治市一年来各行业在生产技术上，有显著发展：
    一、改造工具，如自来水公司工人王立庆创造用铅片代橡皮垫（接水管用），用铅熔液接粗细不同的水管，使全市吃水不因器材缺乏受到影响。新华造纸厂最近研究装置电碾一个，日省九个畜力。义合成纺织工人王凤鸣改造背心机产量增加一倍，成品上消灭了窟窿。南石槽木匠工人孙狗孩创造旱水磨（应用水磨道理，上扇不动，下扇动，以畜力代水力）成功，一天磨麦二市石，超过普通磨一倍以上。
    二、打破老做法，多方省工省料。长市占重要位置的皮毛业，以前熟皮用冷缸，熟一缸货需时一月，而且只在热天能熟，现试用火缸成功（也有用马粪缸的），成一缸货只用七、八天，且不再受气候限制。下西街马丑孩小组利用去年的旧皮汤，熟皮三百一十张，节省小米五斗、皮硝一百九十五斤。边府磁窑，经集体研究，改笨炉为快炉，每窑多装货三千件，还省炭万余斤，节省四天时间，报废由百分之三十减为百分之五至百分之十。
    三、带徒弟最光荣，成为市内各工厂作坊内的新荣誉，西北街郭富则半年内一手教会三十四个妇女织布，申二喜见徒弟一不高兴，就揣摸心思，解决其思想问题或实际困难。他说学徒不高兴就学不到手了。硝工王秉仁每天跑二里远去指导熬硝，一月工夫都教成了。学技术也打破“同行是冤家”，“卖石灰见不得卖白面”等嫉妒思想。如铜炉程钱垒说：“我见了同行，就想谈谈，学人家点窍”。工联木厂郭维全说：“技术无穷尽，一辈学不完。”
    所有这些，都是长市各行业能节省原料减低成本，产量大，质量高的重要原因。（行夫、克仁）
