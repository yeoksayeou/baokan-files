　　Taiyue Administrative Office Issues Draft Winter Production Plan
　　Widely Implement Autumn Plowing and Textile Handicraft Industry
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 9th] In order to fully support the great counter-offensive, the Taiyue Administrative Office has issued a draft winter production plan. The general outline is as follows: First, before the ground freezes this year, all areas should strive to carry out autumn plowing once, except for areas where the war has a particularly serious impact. A vigorous campaign should be carried out during and after the autumn harvest before the ground freezes. In terms of organizational leadership, the organization of labor exchange with people and animals should be grasped tightly, and it should be done actively and in a timely manner so that "the cattle plow every piece of land without rest, and the cattle do not stop plowing until the ground freezes." Mobilize all full and semi-labor women, children, and old men to organize experienced old farmers to exchange labor for plowing the land, taking cattle as a unit, and giving priority to military dependents, cadres, families of martyrs, widows, widowers, and the lonely elderly. In areas with a serious lack of livestock power, organize digging and plowing and seize the opportunity to plow, implementing the slogans "Old farmers never forget autumn plowing" and "One year's crop is done in two years," and eliminate all ideological concerns of the masses, and take care of the livestock plowing the land. All organs and organizations stationed in the area should organize manpower and animal power to help the masses carry out autumn plowing without compensation. At the same time, a manure accumulation campaign should be launched during the autumn plowing. Second, this winter and next spring, we must vigorously carry out the textile movement. From October to the end of February next year, each female spinner should spin ten catties of cotton, carrying out the "ten catties of cotton" movement, and must improve the quality. Implement the slogan "Every household spins cotton, every village weaves cloth." In areas without a foundation, a large number of female spinners should be developed. However, the issue of raw materials and tools must be resolved, and sales must be promoted to the outside world in a planned manner. Trade companies should take the lead in organizing the masses to organize the carrying of goods by horse merchants. In addition, we must continue to promote family dividends for women, labor exchange between skilled and unskilled workers, commendations and rewards, and carry out textile competitions. A textile bonus of one million yuan is proposed to encourage the development of the textile movement. Third, in terms of transportation, the Qu Gao Highway, Lin Tun Highway, and Er Qin Avenue should be repaired to develop transportation cooperatives. Spring plowing loans next year should be changed to winter loans to organize mass transportation activities, mobilize them to purchase a large number of livestock, and closely integrate participation in the war and transportation, learning from the Jincheng Three-Way Mutual Aid Group. Fourth, we must strengthen the production of essential handicraft products and continue to implement the policy of self-sufficiency. In terms of promoting the iron industry, sales channels should be opened up with the Third Sub-district of Western Henan and various parts of Taihang. We should strive to improve quality, change styles, and carry out large-scale exports according to the needs of various places. Fifth, livestock should be bred in a planned and organized manner. This winter, each county is required to establish three to five mating cooperatives, purchase stud donkeys and colts, hire mating experts, and vigorously carry out breeding. Sixth, the credit business should be widely developed. Various cooperatives should absorb a large amount of idle funds from the masses, expand credit funds, conduct experiments and creations, and develop sideline small-scale cooperation to lay a solid foundation for agricultural production labor mutual aid next year.
