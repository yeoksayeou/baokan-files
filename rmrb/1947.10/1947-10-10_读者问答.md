　　Reader Q&A
    Comrade Editor: Please answer the following two marriage problems that have occurred in our area:
    I. Many people from the Wuan New District are doing business elsewhere, mostly in the Northeast. Some left as early as two years before the enemy surrendered, and sent letters in the spring of the year the enemy surrendered, saying they couldn't return due to transportation issues. They were engaged at home when they were young, and now the woman wants to dissolve the engagement. Some left in the year the enemy surrendered, and the woman is now over the legal marriage age (according to the marriage law) and also wants to dissolve the engagement. How should this problem be solved?
    II. Can a woman who is a target of struggle now marry a liberated peasant? (Some of the targets of struggle have fled to other villages, and some have been executed.)
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wuan Second District Government Office, Zhang Zhiyuan
Zhiyuan Comrade: Your questions are answered as follows:
    I. If a marriage was arranged in childhood, and the fiancé has gone to the Northeast without any news, the woman can dissolve the engagement if she wishes. However, if the man is poor and went out to work as an apprentice or shop assistant, and the two had a good relationship in the past, the government can first try to persuade them, and then let the woman decide for herself.
    II. Generally speaking, liberated peasants should not marry landlord women. The landlord women should first be placed under control, made to work, bow their heads to the peasants, and reform their thinking. We can consider this matter after some time has passed. Marrying landlord women casually will disrupt the opposing camps of peasants and landlords, easily undermining the unity of the peasants; moreover, if the woman's thinking is not good and she cannot work, it will also be detrimental to the peasant. In particular, cadres and activists should not marry landlord women. We will see what happens after the landlord women have changed.
    Sincerely,
    　Greetings,
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Editor

　　读者问答
    编辑同志：下面两个在我们这里发生的婚姻问题，请你们解答：
    一、武安新区在外做生意的很多，大部都是在东三省。有些人是在敌人投降前二年就往外走了，敌人投降那年春天还来信，因交通关系不能回来，幼小在家订了婚，现在女人提出解除婚约。有的在敌人投降那年往外走了，女人现已超过结婚年龄（按婚姻法令年龄），也提出解除婚约。这问题如何解决？
    二、斗争对象的女人，现在是否可以和翻身农民结婚？（斗争对象有的逃跑外乡，有的已被处死。）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　武安二区公所　张志远志远同志：你的问题答复如下：
    一、从小家庭订婚，现未婚夫已到关外去了，没有音信，女方提出解除婚约，只要出于自愿，是可以的。但对方如是穷人，出外是去作学徒或店员，过去二人关系很好，政府可以先作些劝说，然后再由女方自己决定。
    二、一般说来，翻身农民不应和地主女人结婚，应先将地主女人管制起来，叫他劳动，向农民低头，改造思想，过些时候再说，现在随便和地主女人结婚，一方面打乱了农民与地主对立的阵营，容易破坏农民的团结；而且女人思想不好，不能劳动，对该农民也不利，特别是干部、积极分子，最好不要和地主女人结婚，以后地主女人有了转变再看。此致
    　敬礼
