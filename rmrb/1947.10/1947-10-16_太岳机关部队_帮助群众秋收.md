Taiyue Military and Civilian Units
Help the Masses with Autumn Harvest

[This newspaper Taiyue 14th dispatch] The Taiyue military and government organizations and troops are actively helping the masses with the autumn harvest. Starting from the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, convalescing soldiers stationed in Yangcheng took the lead in enthusiastically helping the local masses with the autumn harvest. Especially some disabled convalescents, hobbling along with crutches to cut the grain. One convalescent without hands was harvesting by clamping the stalks with their arms. Despite the repeated dissuasion of the masses, they refused to stop and continued to cut. The masses said with emotion: "You became disabled fighting for us, you have made meritorious contributions, you are our benefactors, you should rest well." The convalescents replied: "As soldiers from the people, we must do something for the people as long as we live." A certain cadre family school also helped the masses of ×× village in Jincheng, where they were stationed, with the autumn harvest. The school, with more than sixty people, formed three teams, which were further divided into subgroups, three people in a group. Even those who were sick or pregnant participated voluntarily. Each team enthusiastically proposed competitions. Starting on September 20th, on the first day, thirty-eight people reaped twelve mu of stubble, and in two and a half days, they harvested a total of one hundred and thirteen mu of grain. The common people said, "The Central Army's wives are 'taitais', but the Eighth Route Army's wives are really good!" Soldiers liberated from the Jinan Campaign, led by Company Commander Yang, also helped a certain village with the autumn harvest on September 23rd, cutting fifty-two mu of grain, reaping eighty-seven mu of stubble, and carrying two hundred and forty-nine loads of manure in two days. Military and government organizations and troops in Yuebei also helped the masses with the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Wang Xiangfu and his mutual aid group from the Jinnan Training Corps carried water and manure for the villagers. Even militiamen and laborers who followed the troops to fight on the front lines always took time to help the villagers with the autumn harvest and planting wherever they went. The Chen Chunhuai autumn harvest team of the Ronghe East battle laborers, when they arrived in Anyi, paid special attention to helping poor farmers harvest their crops, and in one day they harvested five mu of sesame for the masses.
