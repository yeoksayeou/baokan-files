Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Rome: Earlier this month, Italian Communist leader Togliatti delivered a speech during the Italian Constituent Assembly's debate on a motion of no confidence, stating: "Two blocs have now emerged in the world: one is a bloc of peace defenders, implementing a policy of peace and opposing warmongers; the other is a warmongering bloc. The Christian Democratic Party has now become a tame slave and joined the warmongering bloc. This warmongering bloc, headed by U.S. imperialism, is basing its policies on war intimidation, military blackmail, and war preparations. We demand the formation of a democratic government that should implement a policy of defending Italian independence against this group of warmongers, and should lead Italy to join the democratic camp that is now fighting for universal peace in Europe and the world. It is now time to establish such a government representing all democratic forces in the republic." Togliatti emphasized, "Regardless of how this vote turns out, the final decision rests with the Italian people, who will announce this decision in the elections to be held in a few months." Finally, when discussing the recent rampant rumors and slanders against the Communist Party, Togliatti said with confidence, "We are full of confidence in our past and future. No slander, ridicule, or libel can confuse us. We want to create a socialist society in Italy, and firmly believe that the freedom of democracy and socialism that we are striving for will surely triumph."

　　意共领袖在立宪议会演说
  　号召组织民主政府
    维护独立反对战争贩子集团
    【新华社陕北十三日电】罗马讯：本月初意共领袖托格利亚蒂于意大利立宪议会辩论不信任投票议案时发表演说称：“现在世界上已兴起了两个集团：一个是和平的保卫者集团，实行和平的政策，反对战争贩子；另一个是战争贩子集团。基督教民主党现已成为驯服的奴隶而参加战贩集团了。以美帝国主义为首的这个战贩集团，正以战争的恫吓、军事吓诈及备战作为他们政策的基础。我们要求组成一个民主政府，这个政府应执行维护意国独立反对这群战争贩子的政策，应当领导意大利加入现正为欧洲以及全世界普遍和平而斗争的民主政营。现在已该是成立这样一个代表共和国一切民主力量的政府的时候了。”托氏着重指出：“不管这次投票如何，最后决定却在于意大利人民，在数月内即将举行的选举中就可宣布这一决定。”托氏最后在谈及最近各方对共产党的造谣中伤甚嚣尘上时，充满信心地说：“我们对于我们的过去与将来都充满了自信。任何谰言、嘲讽及诬蔑都不能迷惑我们。我们要在意大利创造社会主义社会，并坚信我们努力争取的民主与社会主义的自由一定要胜利。”
