[This report from our Taiyue office on the 4th] In various parts of Taiyue, in order to overcome the labor shortage during the mobilization for the war effort, women and children are widely organized to participate in the autumn harvest and autumn planting. In Donggou Village, Songzhuang Township, Qinshui County, in addition to the 50 civilian laborers who went on the expedition to participate in the war, nearly 48 more have been sent on assignments. During the autumn harvest, only 55 male semi-laborers remained. Production Director Shi Wansuo first mobilized his wife, Yang Fengying, military dependent Wang Yueying, and Zhou Feng'e to go to the fields. They said, "Our men are still shedding blood on the front lines, and we are afraid of sweating? Women must break the fear of the sun and being laughed at and go to the fields." Under their propaganda and influence, they first organized ten women to go to the fields, prompting the remaining women to organize themselves one by one. In Baiduo Village, Yangcheng County, women accounted for 270 of the 477 male and female semi-laborers participating in the autumn harvest. They started the autumn harvest on September 17th and harvested all 1,149 mu of grain in the village in four days. By the 23rd, most of it had been threshed and put into storage. When harvesting the grain, the original mutual aid groups were used as units, and equal-value exchange was implemented, so everyone competed to harvest more, which is also the reason why this year's harvest was faster than last year's. Currently, the village is implementing a division of labor between men and women. The men are working hard to plow and deliver manure in order to plant 200 mu more wheat than last year, and the remaining unharvested autumn crops such as corn and beans are left to the women to harvest. After this high degree of organization, the difficulties in all aspects have been resolved. In the Dong Li Gao Wang Gening mutual aid group in Tunliu, even though some families did not have livestock to plant wheat, they used manpower to plant it instead. For example, Liu × only had one donkey and paired it with a small calf, which could not pull the plow, so two children helped the calf pull the plow. People in various places reflected: Although a large number of laborers have gone to support the front, relying on women and children, the harvest is faster and the planting is earlier than last year.

[This report from our Taiyue office on the 4th] The Wang Shuihou mutual aid brigade in Siyuan Village (formerly Wangjiayuan), Qinyuan County, under the slogan of "people don't rest, cattle don't rest, plows don't rest," planted all 337 mu of wheat in the village in seven days. On September 12th, everyone discussed how to plant well and plant more. Everyone believed that most of the full laborers had gone to participate in the war, and it was a bit difficult to harvest autumn and plant wheat, but as long as they were well organized, it would not be a problem. So they organized the people and livestock well, first planting the "cuotian" (roughly plowed fields), then planting the improved "cuotian," first planting for military families and civilian laborers participating in the war, then planting for themselves. There were sixteen cattle in the whole village, four single-pull and ten double-pull, forming a total of nine plows. Families with cattle and families without cattle helped each other. For example, Majiayuan Village had four plows but no one to operate them, so Wangjiayuan sent people to operate them. The third group of Wangjiayuan Village had thirty-two people, only five full laborers, the rest were ten children and thirteen women. When plowing, the women cut grass for the cattle, cleared clods, delivered meals, carried manure, and milled flour. The children mainly carried manure. Nine children who could carry manure delivered 249 loads of manure in one day, enough for seventeen mu of wheat land. At the same time as planting wheat, the women's mutual aid group also began to harvest autumn, picking 121 loads of hemp in two days.

　　妇女儿童普遍下地太岳克服劳力困难
    【本报太岳四日电】太岳各地为克服参战动员中的劳力缺乏，妇女儿童广泛的组织起来，参加秋收秋种。沁水东沟村属宋庄，除远征参战民夫走了五十名外，近又出差四十八人，在秋收的时候，仅剩下男全半劳力五十五名，生产主任师万锁先动员自己的老婆杨风英、军属王月英、周风娥上地，她们说：“男人前方还流血，我们还怕流汗。妇女必须打破怕日晒、怕笑话的思想，去上地。”在她们的宣传影响下，先组织起十个妇女去下地，推动其余妇女也一一组织起来。阳城柏朵村，参加秋收的四百七十七个男女全半劳力中，妇女就有二百七十个，他们从九月十七日开始秋收，四天中即将全村一千一百四十九亩谷全数割完，至二十三日已大部上场，打罢入仓。在割谷时，以原有互助组为单位，实行等价交换，因而谁也争着多割，这也是今年比去年割得快的原因。现该村实行男女分工，男人们为比去年多种二百亩麦，目前正加紧犁地送粪，所余未收的玉茭、豆子等秋禾。交由妇女负责收割，在这种高度组织起来后。解决了各方面的困难。屯留东李高王根宁互助大家，尽管有几家的麦地没牲口种，就用人力代替种上了，又如刘×仅一个驴，配了一个小牛，拉不动犁，就由两个儿童帮助小牛拉犁。各地群众反映：今年虽然大批劳力支前去了，要是靠了妇女儿童，反比去年收得快种得早。
    【本报太岳四日电】沁源四园村（原王家园）王水厚互助大队，在人不闲、牛不闲、犁不闲的口号下，七天内种完全村三百三十七亩麦子。九月十二日，大家讨论怎样就种的好种的多等问题，大家认为全劳力大部去参战，收秋种麦是有点困难，可是只要组织好就不成问题，就把人和牲口组织好，先种搓田后种改搓，先给军属与参战民夫种，后给自己种，全村十六头牛，四头每单拉，十头能双拉，共组成九张犁，有牛户和没牛户互助，如马家园村有四张犁，没有掌犁的，王家园就派人去掌犁，王家园三组三十二个人，只有五个全劳力，其余有十个儿童，十三个妇女，犁地时妇女给牛割草、打圪垃、送饭、抬粪、碾面，儿童们主要是抬粪，九个能抬粪的儿童，一天就送粪二百四十九担，足够上十七亩麦地。和种麦同时，妇女互助组也开始收秋，两天摘大麻一百二十一担。
