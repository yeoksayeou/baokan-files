Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on the 25th, after the National Industry Association called on industrial and commercial circles across the country to refuse the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's invitation to send representatives to participate in a trade delegation to Japan, Shanghai industrial and commercial circles have responded to this call and refused to send representatives. Chiang Kai-shek’s bandit gang's pro-American and pro-Japanese move to open trade with Japan has even forced Tang Jusheng, a member of its own delegation stationed in Japan and serving as a commercial representative, to admit that "the current Japanese trade plan with China is based on the pre-war trade situation between the two countries, and the number of its export goods mostly does not meet our country's needs." Business figures in Shanghai generally believe that the current rampant smuggling of Japanese goods has already caused a major blow to industry and commerce in the Chiang-controlled areas. If trade with Japan is officially opened, Japanese goods will flood in, inevitably leaving the already dying national industries, battered by American goods, with no room to stand.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao of the 2nd of this month, the Peiping Association of Students Returned from Japan held a forum on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's opening of trade with Japan on the 31st of last month. Most of the participants expressed their opposition to this move, believing that: "1. There is no legal basis because the peace treaty has not been determined; 2. Japan has not yet received the punishment it deserves. It is a war criminal and has no right to participate in international trade." They all expressed their indignation at the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's pro-American and pro-Japanese policies at the expense of selling out national interests. Wang Wenxuan emphasized that this was "tailing after the United States." Chen Shouqi explained from a historical perspective that Japan's invasion of China in the past was carried out under the goal of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." If the current opening method is followed, China will export salt, grain, coal, and iron sand, etc., which simply becomes "raw material China, industrial Japan." He pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "pro-American" diplomacy has already caused "American goods to suppress China's national industry to the point where it cannot raise its head. If low-priced Japanese goods come in, national industry will inevitably go bankrupt." Zhang Jinghui pointed out that after the opening of trade with Japan, "the profits will completely fall into the hands of a special class." He said, "The center of China's textile industry is in Tianjin and Shanghai. Private factories lack raw materials, and the raw materials allocated to factories by the China Textile Industries Corporation (assets of the Four Big Families) are often more expensive than the market price. Once Japanese yarn floods in, they will have to close down. Some manufacturers, upon hearing the news of the opening of trade with Japan, were so frightened that they wanted to close down or prepare to switch to sesame oil processing."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. According to a report in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on the 6th, the Chiang Kai-shek "Central Trust Bureau," which monopolizes import and export trade, recently imported a batch of Japanese wool fabrics totaling 400,000 yards, disregarding the severe crisis facing national industry, angering the wool textile industry, who rose up in opposition. After the Bureau's first batch of Japanese wool fabrics was imported, the Shanghai Wool Textile Industry Association questioned it severely. At that time, Yang, the Deputy Manager of the Bureau, deceived them in an attempt to perfunctorily respond, saying: "This cargo was intended to be imported long ago, and will never destroy the national industry." Who knew that the Bureau's second batch of 100,000 yards had already been imported and planned to be sold entirely in North China. The Tianjin First District Wool Weaving Industry Association, in order to save itself, sent a telegram to the Chiang Kai-shek authorities, opposing this measure and severely criticizing the Chiang family's "Central Trust Bureau," saying: "Is it enough to condemn with words and pens their behavior of seeking only profit, destroying the economy, and destroying industry? All of our fellow workers will regard the survival of our wool textile industry as our own survival, and vow to oppose the Bureau's mistake in order to leave a glimmer of hope for our national industry."

　　蒋媚美亲日遭当头一棒
  　上海工商业界拒派代表赴日
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据中央社沪二十五日电透露：自全国工业协会号召各地工商界拒绝蒋家匪帮邀请派代表参加赴日贸易代表团后，上海工商界已响应此一号召拒派代表参加。蒋家匪帮媚美亲日开放对日贸易一举，甚至其本身驻日代表团员任商务代表唐菊生亦不得不承认“现时日本对华贸易计划，系根据战前两国贸易情况拟订，其出口货物数多不合我国需要。”沪商界人士咸信目前日货走私猖獗，已使蒋管区工商业遭受重大打击，一日正式开放对日贸易，日货蜂涌而来，势必使饱受美货摧残业已奄奄一息的民族工业更无立足余地。
    【新华社陕北廿八日电】据本月二日天津大公报透露：上月三十一日北平留日同学会，曾就蒋家匪帮开放对日贸易一事举行座谈，会上大多数对此举表示反对，认为：“一、和约未定，无法律基础；二、日本还没有受到应受的惩罚，他是战犯，没有权利参与国际贸易”。他们对于蒋家匪帮媚美亲日不惜出卖民族利益同表愤慨：王文萱强调指出这是“做美国的尾巴”；陈寿琦就历史上说明：过去日本侵略中国就是在“工业日本，农业中国”的目标下进行，如照目前的开放办法，中国输出盐、粮、煤及铁砂等，那简直成了“原料中国，工业日本”，他指出蒋家匪帮“唯美主义”的外交，已经使“美货压得中国民族工业不能抬头，如果低压的日货来了，民族工业势必破产”，张景惠指出对日贸易开放后“利润完全落于特殊阶级之手”，他说：“中国纺织业中心在津、沪两埠，民营各厂原料缺乏，中纺（四大家族资产）配给各厂的原料比市价往往还贵，一旦日纱涌来，只有关门；一些厂家听到开放对日贸易的消息，就骇得要关门或准备改营麻油加工了”。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据津大公报六日讯：垄断进出口贸易的蒋家“中央信托局”不顾民族工业危机深重，近竟运进口日本呢绒一批，共达四十万码，激怒毛纺织业界群起反对。自该局第一批日本呢绒进口后，沪市毛绒纺织工业同业公会曾予严厉质问，当时该局副经理杨某为图敷衍竟欺骗谓：“此货早有进口之意，绝不摧毁民族工业”。讵知该局第二批十万码又已进口并拟全部倾销华北。津市第一区毛织业同一公会为自救计，特通电蒋当局，反对此项措施，严重指责蒋家“中信局”称：“惟利是图，破坏经济，摧毁工业之行为，岂只口诛笔伐为已足？敝曾同业全体职工。当以我毛纺织工业之存亡为存亡，誓死反对该局此种错误，以为我民族工业留一线生机。”
