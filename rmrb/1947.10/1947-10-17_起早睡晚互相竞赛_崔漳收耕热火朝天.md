　　Competing to Start Early and Sleep Late
  　Cui Zhang's Autumn Harvest is in Full Swing
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The autumn harvest and catch-up planting campaign in Cuizhang Village, District One of Changzhi, is in full swing. In particular, after the "Fat Kids Group" set up a challenge stage, even seventy and eighty-year-old men became so excited that they couldn't sleep well at night and got up before dawn, truly resembling seventeen or eighteen-year-old youths, single-mindedly wanting to compete with the Fat Kids Group. Members of the Fat Kids Group clamorously shouted, "As long as the problems within our group are solved, we guarantee we can keep our challenge stage and not let it be taken down!" Cui Xiaogou said, "We must work day and night. Old men plow the land, and half-grown children, women, and men all go to the fields to harvest grain. The women at home cook, and the women and children cut grain in their spare time." Old man Shi Haiqi jumped up and said, "Although I am fifty-two, I also guarantee to win against him. I will get up before dawn to call everyone." Fat Kid said, "We must harvest quickly, plow quickly, and catch up quickly. We must break the old habit of going to the fields empty-handed and coming back empty-handed, only waiting for the carts to pull. When we go to the fields and come back, each person should carry a few stalks of grain to save the livestock and rush to plant wheat." Haiqi's wife said, "Let the men harvest the waterlogged fields, and we women guarantee to finish harvesting the dry fields without the help of men." These were all agreed upon by everyone. When the people in the village heard that the Fat Kids Group had set up a challenge stage, they were clamoring and shouting in the darkness, and a large pile of fire was lit in the pitch-black sky. Women, children, old men, and young adults were all gathered around. Old man Wang Fusheng, seventy-three years old, also leaned on his cane and shouted when he arrived, "I heard that the Fat Kids have set up a challenge stage. Although my legs are stiff and my back is bent, I will also go to this challenge stage to compete." He then continued, "Let's think about the past when we harvested for the landlords. This year it's for ourselves, so why not do a good job?" Shuangzhi also argued in the dark, "If those with long beards dare to do it, I dare to compete with them even more." Finally, each group totaled up and wanted to move forward. All 635 mu of grain fields in the village must be completed within three days, 950 mu of corn must be completed in four days, and 1,500 mu of autumn land must be completed in twenty days (the village has eighteen head of livestock). If the livestock cannot finish plowing, organize people to pull plows. In addition to completing seventy mu of wheat before the frost, plant it when there is time (plant it if the land is not frozen), and the meeting did not end until midnight. Old man Wang Fusheng did not sleep well all night after returning. He fed the livestock in the middle of the night, and when the rooster crowed for the third time, he called up all the women and children in the group and went to the fields. When Fat Kid got up at dawn to call the people, he met the Fuyuan Group already leaving the village. He quickly called them up and left. When the two groups went to the fields, Fusheng's group had already harvested half a plot, it is not known when they went. The Haishui Group was also arguing on the south bank. The entire river valley, in groups of three or five, or clusters of ten, were planting wheat (some people were also pulling plows), harvesting grain, pulling grain, and repairing roads, working together in groups. The Little Stinky Group took off their jackets and worked with bare backs. Four people harvested three and a half mu of grain early in the morning. Within two days, the entire village harvested 400 mu of grain and rushed to plant 35 mu of wheat. (Qian Wei)

    【本报长治讯】长治一区崔漳村的收秋赶茬运动，热火朝天，特别是胖孩组搭起擂台后，把七、八十的老汉，也激动的黑夜睡不熟，不明就起床，真象变成十七、八的青年一样，一心要和胖孩组比高低。胖孩组员们乱烘烘的吵叫着说：“不成问题解决了组内问题，就保证能保住咱的擂台，不让打下来”。崔小狗说：“咱要连明搭夜干，老汉垡地，半大小孩妇女男人都上地割谷，家里做饭妇女与小孩抽空切谷。”史海气老汉跳起来说：“我虽说五十二啦，也要保证赢了他，不明我就起来叫大家”。胖孩说：“咱要收的快、耕的快、赶的快。就必须打破过去空手去地，空手回来单等大车拉的旧习惯，咱去地回来时每人要捎几个谷，省出牲口赶种麦”。海气媳妇说：“水浸地汉们割，俺妇女保证要把干地割完，不用男人帮助”。这些都得到大家同意。村上人们听说胖孩组搭起擂台了，在黑天下吵吵嚷嚷，在漆黑的天气下，烘起大堆火。妇女儿童老汉，青壮年都堆满了，七十三岁的王福生老汉，也拄着棍子到场就喊叫“我听说胖孩搭起擂台啦，我虽说腿硬腰圪弯，也要上他这擂台比比武。”他又接着说：“咱们想一想过去是给地主割，今年是咱自己的，还不好好干。”双枝在黑地里也吵起来：“长胡子的敢干，我更敢与他比一比”。最后各组总计了一下，都要往前赶。全村六百三十五亩谷地，三天内一定完成，九百五十亩玉茭四天完成，一千五百秋地二十天完成（村上十八犋牲口），牲口垡不完组织人拉犁，霜降前除完成七十亩麦子外，有空还要种（地不冻就要种），直至半夜才散会。王福生老汉回去一夜没睡熟，半夜就喂好牲口，鸡叫三遍，就把全组妇女儿童叫起来下了地。胖孩天将明，就起来叫人们，一出门，就碰见福元组已出了村。他赶快叫起就走，两组去了地，福生老汉的组已割了半块，不知多会去的。海水组也在南岸上吵闹着。整个川地，三五成伙，十来成群，种麦的（也有人拉楼）、割谷的、拉谷的、修路的，成群打伙的干着。小臭货组把袄脱了，赤着脊背在干，四个人，一早就割谷三亩半。全村两天时间内割谷四百亩，赶麦三十五亩。（谦维）
