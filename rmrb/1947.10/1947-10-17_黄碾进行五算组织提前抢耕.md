　　Huang Nian Carries Out "Five Calculations" to Organize Early Seizing of Cultivation
    [Report from Lucheng by this newspaper] After the Fourth District's Huang Nian launched the "Three Seizures" campaign around September 26th and 27th (lunar calendar), by October 9th, the autumn harvest in North Street was complete, and some people became complacent. For example, Lu Mao-fa said, "Our autumn harvest is already good, and we've done two of the three 'seizures'. What are we afraid of with only one left!" The leadership then enlightened and guided everyone to do the calculations, proposing: "Living must be carefully calculated; don't dare to be complacent." Immediately, "Five Calculations" were launched: (1) Calculate how much livelihood remains in the Three Seizures; (2) Calculate how much labor and livestock power North Street has; (3) Calculate the losses from not plowing the land last year; (4) Calculate the reasons for not catching the seedlings this spring; (5) Calculate how to compensate for the grain losses from drought, flood, and windstorms this year. For example, the sixty-year-old Zhang Yang only said: "According to the calculation of land and livestock in North Street, plowing the land would take more than a month. We can't be careless. As the saying goes, 'Men don't forget autumn plowing, women don't forget evening spinning.' Last year, I had 4.4 mu of land in Dongnao. Because I didn't calculate well and plowed late, I only plowed 3 mu, leaving 1.4 mu unplowed and frozen. As a result, I only plowed it this spring. It encountered no rain this spring, and the losses were really unspeakable. The 3 mu that were plowed this spring were planted with grain and caught the seedlings. Now I harvested 3 shi and 2 dou of grain. The unplowed 1.4 mu was hard to plow this spring. The first time I planted old grain and beans, but the seedlings didn't catch. The second time, I changed it to small Jiang beans, but the seedlings were not complete. Finally, I added vegetables. Now I harvest 1 dou of beans and can get 2 dan of vegetables. I don't want to talk about it; it breaks my heart. I must plow the land early this year." It was proposed that "plows have grain, and everyone benefits," and "in years of flooding, the ground freezes early; plowing should be done ahead of schedule." Zhang Biantou said: "This year is a fake autumn. I planted 7 mu of grain, which could have yielded 10 shi and 5 dou of grain, but because of the wind and hail, I only harvested 7 shi. I have to make up for this gap. I plan to completely plow all my autumn land and strive to harvest more grain next year. In addition, I will quickly plow the land early and engage in sideline occupations." It was proposed that "all autumn land should be plowed, and next year, we can seize a handful; early cultivation should be completed, and we should quickly engage in sideline occupations to seize 'Ji'nan'." After discussion, a specific plan for early cultivation was drawn up: North Street has a total of 2140 mu of autumn land, 41 head of livestock (excluding three that are scattered and poor). On average, there are 19 teams of livestock every day. Each team plows 4 mu per day. From the first to the 20th day of the lunar September, 1520 mu can be plowed. In addition, the autumn harvest should be completed before the fifth day. From the sixth day, men and women will organize a plowing team to carry out early cultivation. Thirty-nine young and middle-aged people can hoe 20 mu per day, totaling 300 mu by the 20th. The women's harvesting team will be changed to a plowing team. Forty-two people can hoe 12.6 mu per day, completing 189 mu by the 20th. In addition to catching plows, there are eight male semi-laborers. Four people are assigned to miscellaneous tasks in the village, and four people can hoe 1.6 mu of land per day, completing 24 mu before the 20th. After such precise calculations, early cultivation can be completed before the 21st day of the lunar September.

　　黄碾进行五算组织提前抢耕
    【本报潞城讯】四区黄碾从阳历九月廿六、七展开三抢运动后，到十月九日止十二天时间，北街秋收已完，部分群众思想上自满。如卢毛发说：“咱们秋已收好啦，三抢已干下两抢，留下一抢，这还怕什哩！”领导上便启发引导大家算帐，提出：生活要细算，不敢胡自满。当即展开五算：（一）算三抢中还有多少生活；（二）算北街有多少劳畜力；（三）去年未垡地吃的亏；（四）今春未捉住苗原因；（五）今年旱涝风雹灾损失粮如何补。如六十多岁的老汉张央只说：“按北街土地牲口计算，垡地就得一月多，可不敢大意，俗话说，男人不忘秋垡地，女人不忘夜纺花，我去年东垴地四．四亩因计算不到犁地迟，只垡下三亩，留下一亩四分冻了未犁下，结果今春才犁下，看遇到今春就未雨，吃的亏真不能提啦，那三亩垡下地，今春种上谷都捉住苗，现收谷三石二斗，未垡那一亩四分，春天干犁不动后来硬犁下，第一次种老些谷豆，未捉住苗，二次又改茬成小江豆，苗又不全，最后又补菜；现在打豆一斗，能下两担菜，我不提不伤心，我今年可要早早垡下地”。提出犁头有粮，人人沾光，涝年地冻早，垡地提前搞。张扁头说：“今年是个假秋，我种谷七亩本来能打十石零五斗谷，因受风雹灾，现只打七石，这样个圪窿我要补；计划把我所有秋地完全垡下，争取明年多打粮食，另外赶快提前垡下地，搞副业”。提出秋地全垡下，明年抓一把，抢耕提前完，快搞副业抓“冀南”。经讨论具体订出抢耕计划：北街共秋地二一四○亩，牲口四十一头（除三个支零差外），平均每天十九犋牲口，每犋每天犁四亩，从阴历九月初一到廿日能犁一五二○亩；另外初五前把秋收拾完，从初六起男女组织垡地队进行抢耕，青壮年卅九人，每天能镢二十亩，到二十日共镢三百亩；妇女抢收队，改抢耕队，四十二人每天能镢十二亩六分，到二十日完成一百八十九亩；男半劳力除捉犁外，还有八个，四个到村上支零碎差，四个人每天能镢地一亩六分，二十日前能完成二十四亩，经这样精确计算，阴历九月二十一日前，抢耕就能完。
