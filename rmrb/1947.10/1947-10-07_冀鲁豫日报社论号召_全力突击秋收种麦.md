Jilu Yu Daily Editorial Calls for All-Out Effort to Seize Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting

[This newspaper] dispatches from Jilu Yu on the 5th [of October]: In order to "mobilize and make an all-out effort to seize the autumn harvest and wheat planting," the Jilu Yu Daily published an editorial pointing out that: The entire region has made considerable efforts to support the front in the past year of self-defense war, with 40,000 young and strong people joining the army, and nearly 100,000 laborers assisting the front. In order to guarantee the material foundation for the victory of the counter-offensive, how should the strategically significant autumn harvest and wheat planting be successfully carried out? This is what all Party, government, military, and civilian leading organs must pay attention to. The editorial then pointed out that: The difficulties in this year's autumn harvest and wheat planting, in addition to the lack of manpower and animal power caused by supporting the front and river defense, include the fact that one-third of the waterlogged fields in the entire region still urgently need to be drained; there is also the difficulty that the emancipated peasants have just obtained a large amount of land from the landlords, but lack plowing cattle, farm tools, and seeds. If these problems are solved well, the victory of this year's autumn harvest and wheat planting can be guaranteed. This production is not a shift to large-scale production, but a sudden, seasonal production. Be sure to avoid the commandist style of the past. Calculate all the labor, cattle, and farm tools in the entire village, and mobilize the masses to consciously and voluntarily cooperate and combine to carry out the rush harvest and rush planting. Finally, it called on the field army soldiers to strictly implement the proclamation issued by Commanders Chen and Su regarding the rectification of military discipline, and to minimize the requisitioning of manpower and animals, which is necessary for extraordinary warfare. It also welcomed relevant rear service units and troops undergoing rest and reorganization to mobilize their mules, horses, and stretcher teams to help the masses with production. It called on the commanders and fighters of the local army to closely monitor the enemy in the border areas and along the river defense line, and to armedly defend the autumn harvest and wheat planting. It called on cadres at all levels of the Party, government, military, and civilians to lead and assist the masses in production in their resident areas. It called on women members, children's corps, sisters' groups, and farmers' groups in each village to unite and engage in production. In particular, emancipated women should strive to become women heroes in production labor. It called on village cadres and militiamen to reduce the separation of the masses, re-examine problems and implement solutions in the production teams, and go to the production teams themselves. It called on the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to voluntarily reduce their legal preferential treatment and work together with the masses to help each other in production.

　　冀鲁豫日报社论号召
  　全力突击秋收种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】为“动员起来全力突击秋收种麦”，冀鲁豫日报特发表社论指出：全区在一年来的自卫战争中，支援前线尽了不少的努力，四万青壮年参军，近十万的人工的战动支前，为保证反攻胜利的物质基础，具有战略意义的秋收种麦究应如何得手？这是所有党政军民领导机关所必须重视的。继指出：今年秋收种麦的困难，除因支前河防所引起的人畜力缺乏外，就是至今在全区尚有三分之一的水淹田急需挖沟放水；还有翻身农民刚从地主那里获得大批土地，而缺乏耕牛农具与种子的困难，这些问题如果解决得好，今年秋收种麦的胜利，就能保证。这生产不是转大生产，而是突击性的季节生产，千万要避免过去的命令作风，计算全村所有劳力、耕牛、耕具，发动群众自觉自愿搭配，结合起来进行抢收抢种。最后，号召野战军战士们严格执行陈粟首长发出的整顿军纪的布告，尽量减少非凡战争所必需的人畜支差，更欢迎后方有关和休整的部队动员本部门的骡马、随军担架队等，帮助群众生产。号召地方军的指战员，在边沿区及河防线上，严密的注视敌人，武装保卫秋收种麦。号召各级党政军民干部，在驻地领导和援助群众生产，号召各村妇会员、儿童团、姊妹团、农员等结合起来生产，尤其翻身妇女要在生产劳动中争取妇女英雄。号召村干民兵要减少群众离合，复查问题在生产组中去落实，自己要到生产组去。号召军工烈属自就减少自己的合法优待，要和群众共同劳动互助生产。
