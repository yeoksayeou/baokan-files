　　Huojia and Pingshun Send Surplus Newspapers to Guerrilla Areas
　　[Our Newspaper Dispatches] After the Huojia Bureau received the victorious news published in the 14th issue of the Xinhua Daily, reporting the large-scale counter-offensive launched by the Liu-Deng army, under the leadership of Political Commissars Liang and An, they collected all but one copy of newspapers from various agencies, totaling forty copies, and sent them entirely to the Huojia guerrilla area. At 6:00 PM that day, comrades Li Cunfa and Liu Cunshou excitedly went to the front to deliver the newspapers, so that the masses in the guerrilla area could see the victorious news of our army's counter-offensive and the inevitable defeat of the Chiang bandits as soon as possible.
　　[Another Dispatch] The Pingshun Bureau and relevant education departments jointly convened a meeting of secretaries from various agencies and responsible persons from various businesses to discuss how to save newspapers to support the front lines, and formulated conservation measures: the county government subscribes to one copy of the People's Daily, and each department studies it collectively at the office every morning; the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the bank jointly subscribe to one copy; the Public Security Bureau, the Armed Forces Committee, and the County Party Committee each subscribe to one copy; the detention center changed its subscription from the People's Daily to the Xinhua Daily; businesses subscribe jointly by street and alley, and organize reading groups; the People's Education Center posts a copy outside the door to organize the masses to study. Secretary Wang of the county government also proposed at the meeting that we should cherish the Party newspaper and supervise each other in the future, and not use the newspaper to wrap things or as waste paper. After this reorganization, a total of nine copies of the People's Daily and seven copies of the Xinhua Daily were saved. (Lu Ying)
