Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, urgent telegram, 11th: This morning at 6:00 AM, the Northwest People's Liberation Army captured Qingjian City. The defending enemy, the entire 76th Division of the reorganized army, including division commander Liao Ang, 24th Brigade commander Zhang Xin, and thousands of others, were completely annihilated and captured, with no one escaping. Hu Zongnan ordered Liu Kan to lead the 1st Reorganized Division and the 90th Reorganized Division to rush reinforcements from Yan'an, but Liao's forces had already been wiped out before they arrived.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, urgent telegram, 11th: This morning at 6:00 AM, a part of the main force of the Northwest People's Liberation Army captured Qingjian City. The battle began on the night of the Double Tenth Festival. The defending enemy in the city included the 76th Division headquarters of the reorganized army, the five battalions directly under the division (logistics, artillery, engineering, special forces, and communications), the 24th Brigade headquarters of the reorganized army, the logistics battalion directly under the brigade, and the four companies of artillery, engineering, special forces, and communications, the 70th Regiment, and one battalion of the 72nd Regiment, as well as local reactionary armed forces, all of which were completely annihilated, with no one escaping. Detailed battle results are being tallied.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th: The local armed forces of the Suide sub-district smashed the enemy's first heavy troop grain-grabbing plan. On the 1st, in the northeast of Suide City, they routed the entire 31st Regiment of the 144th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's army's 76th Division, which had invaded to seize grain, killing 17 people including the battalion commander of the second battalion (with the rank of major), and seizing three light machine guns. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, trapped in the isolated city of Suide, fell into a situation of extreme shortage of oil, salt, firewood, and grain. Every day they put out red and white cloth as a signal, hoping that Chiang's planes would deliver supplies. However, according to Song Yiming, a reporter from the World News Agency who defected to our guerrillas, the enemy troops could still share the pancakes sent by plane from September 14th, but after the 18th, they never saw any rice or flour delivered, and they have now eaten all the pumpkins, potatoes, and cabbages around the fortifications surrounding the city. After the repeated disastrous defeats of small groups of Chiang Kai-shek's troops raiding for grain, the Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the city were extremely panicked and wavering, all saying, "If this continues, we will either be wiped out by the People's Liberation Army and guerrillas, or we will be trapped and starved to death in the city." Even the enemy puppet commissioner, county magistrate, and city defense commander Ai Jiesan and others pleaded with Li Riji, the defeated brigade commander of the 165th Brigade of the 36th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek's army: "Our fate is all in your pocket." But Li Riji could only reply: "We all have the same fate." According to people from Yulin, there is also a severe grain shortage in Yulin City, and there have been incidents of wounded soldiers beating the hospital director for eating sandy rice. Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers are so hungry that they are deserting in large numbers, and even openly asking to go home.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th: After the Northwest People's Liberation Army converged in the Huanglong Mountain area, it continued to sweep south. On the 8th, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated a battalion of the Chiang-supported Shaanxi Security Regiment entrenched in Ganjiang Town, northwest of Taiyang. Detailed battle results are being tallied.
