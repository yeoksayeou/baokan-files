　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Reports from various sources indicate that the French economic situation continues to deteriorate. The French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, stated on the 24th that in order to maintain the current bread ration, France needs to import 825,000 tons of grain this year, and the source of this amount is currently undetermined. There are rumors in Paris that the Ramadier government will once again reduce people's rations. Furthermore, according to the "Volunteers' Newspaper," it was pointed out at the cabinet meeting on the 24th that France will have no US dollars within three weeks. A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry also stated on the 25th that France's US dollar reserves will be depleted within a month. If foreign aid cannot be obtained in October, then "the entire future of France's economic recovery will be in jeopardy; even if assistance is received in November or December, it will be too late." The fuel problem is equally serious. The cabinet meeting on the 24th decided to reduce fuel for transportation vehicles again, and electricity supply has also been reduced. Some areas of Paris have been completely without electricity since the 25th.
　　Under these circumstances, US Treasury Secretary Snyder arrived in France from England on the 20th to conduct negotiations with French Finance Minister Schuman and others. The Ramadier government, given the upcoming municipal elections on October 19, is eager to obtain US loans to deceive voters. However, fearing the anger of the French people, it dared not fully accept the US conditions. Snyder immediately applied pressure and deliberately revealed that the United States is primarily concerned with the recovery of the Ruhr industrial region. In order to increase Ruhr steel production according to the Anglo-American plan, the United States will allocate 3 billion US dollars.

　　法经济情势继续恶化
  　粮食缺额尚无着落美元外汇即将枯竭
    【新华社陕北三十日电】各方讯：法国经济形势继续恶化。法驻美大使庞纳廿四日称：为保持目前的面包配给量，今年内法国需要八十二万五千吨粮食的进口，而此项缺额，目前尚无着落。巴黎刻正风传拉马第当局将再次减低人民口粮。另据“义勇军报”透露，二十四日的阁议上曾指出：三星期内，法国将无一块美元。二十五日法外交部发言人亦称：法国美元外汇将于一个月内枯竭。倘若外援不能在十月份得到，则“法国经济恢复的整个未来将陷于危境、即使在十一月或十二获得援助，都嫌太迟。”燃料问题同样严重。二十四日阁议决定，重新减少运输汽车的燃料，电力供给也已减少。巴黎某些区域自二十五日起即完全停电。
    在此情形下，美国财长斯奈德于二十日自英抵法与法国财长舒曼等进行谈判。拉马第当局鉴于十月十九日的市选即将到来，急于取得美国贷款以骗取选票。但慑于法国人民的愤激情绪，故对美国条件不敢遮加接受。斯奈德即施以压力，并故意透露：美国首先关心鲁尔工业的恢复，为使鲁尔钢产按英美计划提高，美国将拨予三十亿美元。
