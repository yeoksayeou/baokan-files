To the Editorial Comrades:

　　The special agent Niu Dengfeng from Qiushuyuan, Third District, Licheng, served as a textile technician in Changling Village. He altered and forged road passes, preparing to flee. On September 15th, I discovered this and arrested him. Upon inspection, we found that this agent had been keeping six old road passes dating back to April of last year. His method of alteration was to cut out the characters from the original pass and then paste them over with strips of paper of a similar color. If one is not careful, it is difficult to detect. I hope that cadres and militiamen in all regions will strictly examine the movements of all passersby and carefully check whether their road passes are valid. At the same time, in the future, all regions issuing road passes must remember to collect them after they expire to prevent old road passes from falling into the hands of saboteurs. (En Kui)

　　查路条要仔细编辑同志：
    黎城三区秋树垣大特务牛登丰，在长岭村任纺织技师，涂改与伪造路条，准备逃跑，在九月十五号被我发觉，将其捕获扣押，当即检查出该特务保存着从去年四月以来的旧路条六张。他涂改办法，是把通行证字割下来，再用边儿一色纸条剪下来糊上，如果不加注意就看不出来。希我各地干部民兵同志对来往行人必须严格审查，看其行动，并且审查其路条是否合适。同时今后各地开路条，须注意过期收回，以免旧路条落入破坏分子之手。（恩魁）
