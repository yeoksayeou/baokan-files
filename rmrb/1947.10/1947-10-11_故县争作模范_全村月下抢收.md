　　Guxian Competes to be a Model
　　Entire Village Harvests Under the Moonlight
　　[Our Newspaper Changzhi News] The Guxian Village held a meeting on the evening of the 17th day of the eighth lunar month to discuss the implementation of the slogan "Harvest with the Yellow River, Harvest, and Plow Accordingly," launching a continuous night harvesting campaign. Everyone said, "Keep a clear head, defeat the wind and frost!" As soon as the moon rose, militia members, women, and children went to the fields in groups with harvesting tools, shouting "Let's go!" They sang and ran to the fields to carry out the harvesting. Under the bright moonlight, the whole village harvested all night. Dogs barked back and forth in the village. Nine groups participated, including 59 militiamen and self-defense team members, 8 children, and 5 women. The first night, they harvested until the second watch of the night, cutting 199 mu of corn and 10 mu and 2 fen of millet. The second night, they harvested until the third watch of the night, with the number of participating militiamen increasing to 62, 14 children, and 15 women, cutting a total of 365 mu of corn and 20 mu of millet. Women and militia activist Zhang Zhigen said, "I earned four jin of rice for cutting four mu of corn and six jin of rice for cutting three mu of millet in two days and two nights." Everyone reflected, "Fighting against the wind and frost with hard work, we finished it all without sleeping for two nights!" They challenged Hehetou Village to finish harvesting millet by the 19th, finish cutting corn by the 20th, plow the land by the first day of the month, and check the fields to be clean and empty by the second day. If they fail to do so, they will lose a big flag.

　　[Our Newspaper Xingtai News] Labor hero Li Shunhua from Zhehu convened a village cadre meeting on the 21st to study how to quickly complete the rush harvesting and planting. Shunhua said, "Pay attention to the autumn harvest, gold is everywhere. As long as we don't idle, food is everywhere." He also pointed out that this year the crops are not ripe evenly, which conflicts with wheat planting, and we should organize all our efforts to "cut one piece when it's ripe, shade it as we cut, and cultivate and plant as we go," to strike first. It was also decided: (1) Use points, record work according to activity, and continue to implement contracting. (2) Ensure that the families of military personnel are given priority for autumn harvest and wheat planting. (3) Cultivate carefully and plant wheat early and quickly. (4) Break the saying of "eat for the whole autumn if we harvest, and when else to eat if not in autumn," and practice strict economy. After the meeting, the groups challenged each other.

　　故县争作模范
  　全村月下抢收
    【本报长治讯】故县村在阴历八月十七晚集会讨论贯彻“随黄、随割、随犁”口号，开展连夜抢收运动。大家说：“脑筋要清爽，战胜风和霜”，月亮刚上来，民兵妇女儿童成群结队，拿着秋收武器，在街上喊了一声“快走吧”！唱着歌跑着步到地里实行抢收。在大明月亮下，全村连夜抢收，村里狗来回咬着，九个组共参加民兵自卫队五十九个、儿童八个、妇女五个，头天黑夜割到二更天，共杀玉茭一百九十九亩，谷十亩零二分。第二天黑夜割到三更，民兵参加增到六十二个、儿童十四个、妇女十五个，共杀玉茭三百六十五亩，谷二十亩。妇女民兵积极分子张枝根说：“两天两夜割了玉茭四亩赚米四斤，割谷三亩赚米六斤。”大家反映：“战胜风霜努力干，两夜未眠齐干光！”，和河头村挑战赶十九割完谷，二十日杀完玉茭，初一犁完地，初二检查场光地净，说到做不到输大旗一杆。

    【本报邢台讯】折户劳英李顺华，二十一号召开村干会，研究如何迅速完成抢收抢种，顺华说：“秋收关心，遍地黄金，只要不闲，遍地是饭。”又指出今年庄稼成熟不齐，与种麦矛盾，应组织全力“熟一片割一片，随割随阴随耕随种”，先下手为强。又决定：（一）使用分票，按活记工，继续实行包工。（二）保证先给军属收秋种麦。（三）精耕细作把麦子种的早又快。（四）打破收不收吃一秋和秋天不吃点啥时吃的说法，厉行节约，会后各组又互相挑战。（增章）
