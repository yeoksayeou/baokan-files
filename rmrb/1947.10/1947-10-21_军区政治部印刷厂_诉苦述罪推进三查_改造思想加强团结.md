　　Military Region Political Department Printing Factory
　　Promote Three Check-ups Through Speaking Bitterness and Confessing Sins
　　Transform Thinking and Strengthen Unity

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Three Check-ups Movement in the Printing Factory of the Military Region Political Department has achieved great progress in the ideological transformation of workers after a period of general self-reflection and the movement of speaking bitterness and confessing sins. During the Three Check-ups study, all cadres and workers in the factory studied together, with the Party, government, and labor union cooperating with each other, adopting the method of typical exposure at large meetings and supplementary self-reflection in small group meetings. Old Liu, a worker from a poor background, boldly exposed his landlord-sympathizing thoughts during the land reform, and revealed his embezzlement of cash and corrupt enjoyment in his work, feeling sorry for the revolution and the liberated masses, and felt ashamed. A intellectual cadre from a poor background exposed that she sheltered her uncle-in-law, who was being struggled against, and acted as an air-raid shelter for the landlord during the mass struggle. After ideological awakening, a worker from a rich peasant family exposed that he acted as an "invisible grass" for the landlord, hiding three targets of struggle to work in the factory. After this stage of self-reflection, it then turned to the movement of speaking bitterness and confessing sins, where the Study Committee (composed of the Party, government, and labor union) went deep into the masses to speak bitterness, inspiring workers to speak of their bitterness and grievances, and mobilizing employees from landlord backgrounds to consciously confess their sins and change their positions. Putting the speaking of bitterness and the confessing of sins in contrast, the meeting place was arranged extremely solemnly, and the parents of many workers and peasants who were exploited, harmed, and killed by the landlord class were written on the memorial hall. Many workers who participated in speaking bitterness burst into tears at the sight of the memorial tablets of their murdered parents, recounting the feudal exploitation crimes of the landlord class. Old Wang of the kitchen cried as soon as he mentioned begging for food when he was eight years old... Old Fu of the kitchen was an activist discovered during the visit to speak bitterness. His father and three sons fled to Lucheng, suffering from the high rent and high interest exploitation of the landlord. The landlord's son also stole the tender corn from his field to cook and eat. Old Fu twice tried to take it back, but was beaten and his legs were broken by the landlord. His father died of anger because he was wronged in a lawsuit. Senior cook Lao Rong guarded his father's memorial tablet, sadly recounting the tragic scene of his father being forced to death by the landlord, saying: "Before my father died, he told me: 'Work hard and avenge your father!'" Type-setting worker Wang Yongzhi said: "I have been in the Red Army for more than ten years, and I still don't know where my home is." When he talked about his parents selling his sister and himself to cross the river to northern Shaanxi to find the Red Army, all the workers shed tears for him. He was determined to get rid of the baggage given to him by feudal society and work better for the people. After the workers spoke their bitterness and traced the roots, their class consciousness was greatly improved. A group of employees from landlord backgrounds carried out a movement to confess their sins, automatically exposing the sins of their feudal families, and expressing their determination to honestly serve the people as servants. The enthusiasm for work and study in the whole factory was unprecedentedly high, and a large number of new activists were discovered. The Study Committee is relying on these activists to help a few workers who are ideologically confused and hiding feudal remnants to automatically lay down their burdens and return to the position of the masses. After more than a month of intense study, a new atmosphere of unity was shown inside the factory. When the typesetting room had free time, they automatically went to help the binding room, rushing to make finished products and supporting each other. The relationship with the villagers was also improved. All employees automatically squeezed out time to help harvest the autumn crops. In response to the call for counter-offensive to support the front line movement, all employees unanimously launched a challenge competition to the printing factories in the border area, aiming to make contributions to the people in the great counter-offensive.

    【本报讯】军区政治部印刷厂三查运动，经过普遍反省和诉苦述罪运动，对工人思想改造获得很大进展。三查学习中，全厂干部与工人在一起学习，党政工互相配合，采取大会上典型暴露，小组会补充反省方式。由赤贫出身的工人老刘大胆暴露他在土改中怜悯地主思想，揭发了在工作中贪污现款腐化享乐行为，感到对不起革命和翻身群众，惭愧不已。一个贫苦出身知识分子干部，揭发了她在群众斗争中，掩护被斗争的姑父，为地主当防空洞的事实。一个出身富农家庭的工人思想觉悟后，暴露了他替地主当“隐身草”，掩蔽三个斗争对象到工厂做工。经过这一阶段反省，接着即转入诉苦述罪运动，由学委会（党政工共同组成）深入群众诉苦，启发工人诉苦诉冤，发动地主出身职工自觉述罪，转变立场。把诉苦与述罪对照起来，会场布置极为严肃，把许多被地主阶级剥削残害杀死的工农父母，都写到灵堂上，许多参加诉苦工人，一见被害父母灵位，便悲声痛哭，历诉地主阶级封建剥削罪恶。伙房老王，一提起他八岁要饭时……就哭了。伙房老傅，是访苦中发现的积极分子，他父子三人逃荒到潞城，受尽了地主高租大利剥削，地主家儿子还偷劫他地里嫩玉茭拿去煮吃，老傅两次去夺回来，反被地主打断了腿，父亲因打官司受屈生气病死了，伙房上士老戎他守在父亲灵位面前，悲痛的诉说着父亲被地主逼死的凄惨情景时说：“我父亲在临死之前，还嘱我：‘好好劳动，为父报仇出这口气。’”铸字工人王永智说：“我自参加红军十几年以来，还不知道我家在那里，说到他父母要卖掉他妹妹和自己渡河到陕北找红军的情形，全体工人都为之掉泪。他决心要刨掉封建社会给予自己的包袱，更好的为人民工作，工人们经过诉苦刨根，阶级觉悟大为提高。一部分地主出身职工，则进行了述罪运动，自动揭发封建家庭的罪过，表明了自己要老老实实为人民当勤务员。全厂工作学习的积极性空前高涨，发现大批新的积极分子，学委会正依靠这些积极分子，帮助少数思想糊涂，掩藏封建尾巴的工人，自动放下包袱，回到群众立场上来。经过月余紧张学习后，工厂内部表现了新的团结气象，排字房工作有空即自动去帮助装订房，赶制成品互相支援。和驻村群众关系亦有改进，全厂职工自动挤出时间，下地帮助收秋，在响应反攻号召支援前线运动中，全体职工一致向边区各印刷厂发起挑战竞赛，要在大反攻中为民立功。（冰、帘、琴）
