　　Lincheng Third District Solves Difficulties of Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers:
  　Entire District Plants Additional 5,000 Mu of Wheat
    [Our Newspaper Lincheng News] The Third District calls on village cadres to conduct thorough inspections, facing the poor and hired laborers, and to resolve the specific difficulties of the poor in planting wheat, door to door. The following solutions were formulated: First, the village production committee should distribute or lend the village's undistributed fruits and obligatory grain to poor peasants, hired laborers, military cadres' families, etc., through member discussions, so that the poor can plant wheat. Second, in Gangxi Village in this district, the cooperative paid for the wheat seeds and gave them to the poor to plant first, and then they would repay later, solving the difficulty of wheat seeds for the poor. Third, adjustments were made within the mutual aid group, emphasizing mutual assistance and love to solve various difficulties. For example, Cui Jinglin in Gangxi voluntarily took out wheat for others to plant first. By adjusting wheat seeds, the mutual aid organization was further consolidated. The masses said, "Participating in mutual aid can solve anything."
    Due to the above three methods, the wheat seed difficulties in the entire district were solved, with a total of ten shi and one dou of wheat seeds adjusted throughout the district, solving the difficulties of ninety-one households. The entire district planted an additional five thousand and fifty mu of wheat. Now this district is continuing to plant stubble wheat.

    [Our Newspaper Zanhuang News] The first stage of wheat planting in the Fourth District has passed. According to statistics from only five villages, such as Nanzhuli and Beiyanzhuang, 2,337.5 mu of wheat have been planted, accounting for more than one-third of the land area. Currently, there is a concentrated effort to harvest early and plant stubble wheat. Some villages cannot plant more due to limitations of wheat seeds, fertilizer, and labor. For example, in Nanxuzha Village, it was found that among those expanding wheat fields, six households did not have livestock to plant, ten households did not have labor, six households lacked wheat seeds, and six households lacked fertilizer. For example, Hu Quanhe originally planned to plant eight mu, but could plant eleven mu if difficulties were resolved. Liu Qiuyin could originally plant seven mu, but could plant eleven mu with assistance. This calculation shattered the cadres' belief that there were no difficulties to plant. Upon inspection, each village has some poor anti-Japanese dependents, peasants who have not thoroughly turned over, and orphans who cannot plant or plant little. In resolving various difficulties, the masses have also discussed new methods, such as adjusting wheat seeds by calling on those who have turned over well, active cadres, to voluntarily take out their surplus wheat to help poor brothers. For example, Liu Xinwang, anti-taxation committee member of Nanxuzha Village, voluntarily took out two dou of wheat for adjustment; Hu Yunsheng, the political director, lent out all of his remaining five sheng of wheat seeds. Under their influence, Liu Qiuyin and others made adjustments, thus solving the difficulty of wheat seeds. (Liu Kuan)

　　临城三区解决贫雇困难
  　全区多种五千亩麦
    【本报临城讯】三区号召村干部，应面向贫雇群众深入检查，挨门挨户的解决贫雇的种麦具体困难。并订出解决办法如下：一、村生委员会把村未分的果实及义务粮通过会员讨论合理的分给或借给贫雇军干属等，使贫雇群众能种上麦子。二、如本区岗西村，合作社先出钱购买下麦籽，给贫雇群众先种，以后再还，解决了贫雇的麦种困难。三、在本互助组内进行调剂，提出大家应互助友爱，解决各样困难，如岗西崔京林自动拿出了麦子叫别人先种上了，通过调剂麦种更巩固了互助组织，群众说：“参加互助什么事也能办了”。
    由于以上三种办法，解决了全区的麦种困难，全区共调剂麦种十石零一斗，解决了九十一户困难。全区多种麦子五千零五十亩。现在这区正在继续种茬麦子。

    【本报赞皇讯】四区种麦的第一阶段已经过去，仅南竹里、北延庄等五个村的统计，已种麦二千三百三十七亩五分，占土地面积三分之一强。目前正突击早收、赶种茬麦。有些村由于麦种肥料、劳力的限制，不能多种。如南徐杂村，发现在扩大麦田中有六户没有牲口种不上，有十户没有劳力，有六户缺麦种，有六户没肥料。如胡全合，原来计划种八亩，如能解决困难，则可种十一亩。刘秋印，本来能种七亩，如能帮助则可种十一亩。这样计算打破了干部以为没困难能种上的思想。检查起来各村都有一些贫苦抗属，翻身不透的农民、孤寡，种不上或种不多。在解决各种困难上，群众也讨论有新的办法，如调剂麦种号召翻身好的积极分子干部自动将所余麦子，拿出调剂，帮助穷弟兄，如南徐杂村抗勤委员刘心旺自动拿出麦子二斗调剂；政治主任胡云生将仅余的五升麦种全部借出，在他们影响下，有刘秋印等进行调剂，就这样解决了麦种的困难。（刘宽）
