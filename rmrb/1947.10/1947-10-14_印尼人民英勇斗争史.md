　　The Heroic Struggle History of the Indonesian People
    Zhang Shangming
    The Early Anti-Dutch Struggle of the Indonesian People

    Since the Dutch East India Company (the vanguard of Dutch aggression against Indonesia) was established in Batavia in 1602, the Indonesian people have begun their struggle against Dutch plunder and oppression. The anti-Dutch movement that broke out in Java in 1825 lasted for five years, the largest of many uprisings since the 17th century. Outside Java, farmers in Borneo, Celebes, and especially Sumatra, launched wars against the invaders (the famous thirty-year Aceh War against the Dutch from 1873 to 1903), which prevented the Netherlands from controlling all of Indonesia's territory until the end of the 19th century. The Dutch policy of massacre and dividing national unity to suppress the Indonesian people, in turn, inspired the Indonesian people's determination to resist the conquerors.
    The Development of the Indonesian National Independence Movement After 1908

    In the early 20th century, a political trend of national revival emerged among Indonesia's new intellectuals and small national bourgeoisie. They were dissatisfied with Dutch colonial rule and were also influenced by the Russian Revolution (1905) and the Chinese Revolution (1911). This trend promoted the Indonesian people's anti-Dutch struggle towards a conscious path. Various political parties representing the interests of all strata of Indonesian society were established during this period.

    In 1908, Javanese doctor Wahidin organized the "Education Promotion Association" to strive for "the broadest possible popularization of education, the development of agriculture and technology" through legal means, to promote "the development of Javanese art and science," to demand that Indonesians be given better-paid official positions, and to advocate that Indonesians should enjoy equal rights with Europeans. This organization had close ties with the Javanese semi-feudal bureaucratic group and represented the interests of the weak national bourgeoisie. It did not have a deeply rooted mass base, but it made great contributions to enlightenment work.

    During the same period, the "Islamic Union" organization appeared in Java (established in 1908, reorganized in 1913). It was mainly a political party of peasant petty-bourgeoisie, using the guise of religion (because more than 90% of Javanese people believed in Islam). It began with the aim of excluding Chinese commercial economy, advocating sectarianism such as "obtained from Muslims and sold to Muslims" in economy. Later, it formally joined the anti-Dutch movement, put forward slogans such as "land belongs to farmers, improve the lives of Muslims," widely organized farmers' associations, and organized trade unions in some areas. It united a large number of peasants, and its members also included small merchants, clerks, intellectuals, and some workers. At its peak, it had 3.5 million members. Under its influence, peasant uprisings and spontaneous strikes occurred throughout the Indonesian islands at that time. This organization once became the mainstream of promoting the Indonesian revolutionary movement.

    One of the political parties of great significance to the Indonesian revolution at that time and later - the Indonesian Social Democratic Party - was established in Semarang in 1914. It not only laid the communist ideological foundation for the birth of the Indonesian Communist Party, but also the Dutch participation in the First World War was ruthlessly exposed by the revolutionary Social Democratic leaders. The revolutionary Social Democrats opposed the defense expenditure plan that strengthened exploitation and the Dutch colonial policy, and actively carried out socialist propaganda activities among Indonesian workers, petty bourgeoisie, and intellectuals. In addition, there was the "Indian Party" (an organization of Eurasians); and the "East Indies Association" established in the Netherlands, which was an advanced group of Indonesian intellectuals studying in Europe who carried out the independence movement. The current Indonesian Vice President Hatta and former Prime Minister Sjahrir were also among the organizers and leaders of this group. (To be continued)

　　印尼人民英勇斗争史
    张上明
    印尼人民早期的反荷斗争
    自从东印度公司（荷兰侵略印尼的先遣队）于一六○二年在巴城成立之后，印尼人民便开始了反抗荷兰的掠夺和压迫的斗争。一八二五年在爪哇爆发的反荷运动，继续了五年之久，这是十七世纪以来许多次起义中规模最大的一次。爪哇外面，由于婆罗洲、西里伯斯、特别是苏门答腊的农民，发动了反对侵略者的战争（一八七三——一九○三年有名的亚齐反荷三十年战争），使荷兰直到十九世纪末期都还不能控制印度尼西亚的全部领土。荷兰对印尼人民所采取的屠杀和分裂民族团结之镇压政策，其结果反而激励着印尼人民反抗征服者的决心。
    一九○八年以后印尼民族独立运动的发展
    二十世纪初叶，印尼新生的知识分子和少数民族资产阶级中间，产生了复兴民族的政治潮流。他们对荷兰的殖民地流治不满，同时又受到俄国革命（一九○五年）与中国革命（一九一一年）的影响。这个潮流，推动着印尼人民的反荷斗争走向自觉的道路。印度尼西亚代表着各阶层利益的各个政治党派，就是在这一时期内先后成立的。
    一九○八年爪哇医生瓦希定组织了“教育促进会”，以合法手段，争取“最广义的教育普及，发展农业与技术”，提倡“爪哇艺术、科学的发展”，要求给予印尼人以报酬较好的官职，鼓吹印尼人应和欧人享有平等权利。这个组织与爪哇半封建的官僚集团有密切联系，代表着势力微弱的民族资产阶级的利益，它没有根深蒂固的广大群众基础，然而，它在启蒙工作上曾有很大的贡献。
    在同一时期，爪哇出现了“回教同盟”的组织（一九○八年成立，一九一三年改组）。它主要是农民小资产阶级的政党，利用宗教的外衣（因爪哇人百分之九十以上信奉回教），开始是以排挤华侨商业经济为宗旨，在经济上标榜“自回教徒手中得来，卖给回教徒”等宗派主义色彩。后来正式卷入反荷运动，提出“土地属于农民，改善回教徒生活”等口号，广泛组织农民协会，并在部分地区组织工会。它团结了广大的农民群众，其盟员还包括小商人、职员、知识分子及一部分工人。在全盛时期会员数达三百五十万人，在它影响之下，当时印尼各岛普遍发生了农民起义和自发性的罢工。这一组织一度成为推动印尼革命运动之主流。
    对于当时及后来的印尼革命有重大意义的政党之一——印尼社会民主党，于一九一四年在三宝珑成立。它不仅为印尼共产党的诞生奠定了共产主义的思想基础。而且，荷兰参与第一次世界大战，曾经为革命的社会民主党领袖所无情揭露，革命的社会民主党人反对过加强剥削的围防支出案及荷兰的殖民地政策，积极在印尼工人、小资产阶级、知识分子中间进行社会主义的宣传活动。此外，还有“印度党”（为欧印混血儿的组织）；及在荷兰成立的“东印度协会”，它是留欧印尼知识分子进行独立运动的先进团体。印尼现任副总统哈达及前内阁总理沙利尔当年也是这一团体之组织者与领导者之一。   （未完待续）
