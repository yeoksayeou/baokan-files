　　Weizi Township: Early Planting, Catching Up with Stubble, More Manure
　　More Grain to Celebrate the Great Counteroffensive
    [Our newspaper, Lucheng News] Weizi Township, Second District, after twelve days and nights of seizing the time to plant wheat, the village's 2,647.2 mu of regular wheat fields were all successfully planted. On the night of the 22nd, a mass meeting of the whole village was held. After summing up and evaluating, Duan Migui's team was selected as a model. The township government awarded him a large red flag, and the enthusiasm of the masses was even higher. The leadership seized the opportunity to further promote the autumn harvest and rush to plant wheat, using the celebration of the Great Counteroffensive victory to inspire the masses. Immediately, groups of people freely gathered and started to argue. Some said, "Chiang Kai-shek is about to collapse!" Some said, "At this rate, it won't take a few days to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek!" Some said, "We have to harvest and plant wheat quickly to strive for more grain to support the counteroffensive army." Some said, "We should first harvest the crops and plant wheat for the families of military personnel and militia members participating in the war." After a lively discussion among the masses, the old man Zhou Facai immediately stood up and said, "The front lines are shedding blood and fighting Chiang Kai-shek, we must step up production in the rear and strive to harvest the autumn crops early and rush to plant wheat. My team guarantees to expand the wheat fields to 60 percent. I am different now than before, just like a young girl, a girl changes eighteen times, the more she changes, the more capable she becomes. If you dig a slope, you have to eat a nest, so that we can eat and the army can eat." Zhang Mangzhi said, "Today, when we harvest the autumn crops, our women must be as good as men, and we must challenge and compete with the men to seize the time to harvest the autumn crops and rush to plant wheat, so that they can eat and dress well in the front and eliminate more enemies." Wang Chenglie said, "Early planting, catching up with stubble, more manure, and more grain is like winning a battle. The front is fighting with Chiang Kai-shek, and we in the rear are fighting with the land." After discussion by the masses, it was finally unanimously proposed to guarantee the victory of the Great Counteroffensive, and to achieve the following three guarantees: (1) Guarantee that the wheat field will be expanded to 60 percent, if not, there will be an inspection after the autumn harvest; (2) Guarantee to first harvest the crops and rush to plant wheat for the families of military personnel and militia members participating in the war. No matter what you do, military dependents will always be the first in everything in the future, without any difficulty, and the land must be guaranteed to be planted well; (3) Guarantee that all labor and animal power will be organized, without coercion or quotas, and the autumn harvest and stubble planting will be completed earlier than other villages. At this moment, they are harvesting, plowing, and planting as they go. (Shi Tuzhang, Guo Zhuhai)
