　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 29th: A unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army, on the 24th, swiftly captured Ziya Town, an important stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits southwest of Tianjin, annihilating all the defending enemies. The enemy in Qing County fled upon hearing the news, and the city was liberated again on the same day. (Note: Qing County was liberated on June 14th and re-occupied by the Chiang army at the end of July.) In this battle, the entire battalion and one company of the 451st Regiment of the 151st Division of the 62nd Army (formerly reorganized division), a total of over 700 men, were annihilated, including 572 captured alive. Captured were 2 mortars, 2 rocket launchers, 7 sixty-millimeter guns, 31 light and heavy machine guns, and 231 rifles and carbines.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 29th: Our troops in Southern Shandong adopted a combination of tactics involving internal step-by-step resistance and extensive external attacks, severely hitting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's divisional "mopping-up" operations in the Southern Shandong Mountains. At the beginning of September, the enemy mobilized seven regiments of regular army forces, cooperating with the Chiang Kai-shek "Returning Home Regiments," to conduct "mopping-up" operations in the Baolianggu and Zousi mountain areas. In the Baolianggu mountain area, the enemy, on the 2nd, with parts of the 180th, 37th, and 132nd Brigades of Feng Zhi'an's forces, along with approximately four regiments of local Chiang troops, advanced in two columns from the Zao-Xian line. Our army, in addition to frontal resistance by a part of its forces, repelled an attack by one enemy regiment in the area north of Xiangcheng; another part moved to the external lines, launching attacks on the northern plains of Pi (County), and continuously mopped up the "Returning Home Regiments" in that area on the 5th, 6th, and 7th; at the same time, the Lin(cheng)-Teng working team also launched attacks on eastern Teng, completely annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek Bao Gong Office in Qingshi; other units also actively operated, forcing the main enemy force to retreat to Zao Yuanfang, and a large part to flee north to Fengqiu. The anti-"mopping-up" battle in the Baolianggu mountain area came to a victorious conclusion. Simultaneously with the above, the enemy's Second Security Brigade, cooperating with the Chiang Kai-shek Zou County Security Team, totaling more than 2,500 men, "mopped up" the Zousi mountain area. Our army then attacked the area north of Pingyi, capturing key strongholds such as Silongmiao, and completely annihilated Sun Guangde's unit of the Chiang Kai-shek Teng County Security Regiment in the area north of Chengqian. Currently, the enemy "mopping up" in Zousi has been forced to move to the Chengqian-Pingyi line, and our army is fiercely counterattacking. As of the 10th, a total of 530 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers have been annihilated by all routes, including 140 captured, 9 heavy machine guns seized, and 139 rifles.
