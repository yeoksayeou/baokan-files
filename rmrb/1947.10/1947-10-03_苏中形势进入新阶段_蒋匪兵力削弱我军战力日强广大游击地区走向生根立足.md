Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 1st Dispatch: A reporter from the Central Jiangsu Branch commented on the current situation in Central Jiangsu, stating: Since the Yancheng Campaign and the start of the nationwide counter-offensive, the situation in the Central Jiangsu Chiang-Kai-shek and our liberated areas has entered a new stage. This is primarily reflected in the significant change in the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves. In March, the enemy's total strength in Central Jiangsu consisted of two reorganized divisions of regular troops (namely the 4th Division and the 49th Division, totaling five brigades, of which the 59th Brigade of the 4th Division was missing), three regiments of puppet and traitorous troops (two regiments of the remnants of Hao's traitorous troops, and one regiment of the puppet army under Xu Rong), and a total of 76 squadrons of Chiang's provincial and county security forces. This amounted to approximately 80,000 men. In the five and a half months from April to the present, over 16,000 men have been annihilated, and over 5,000 have revolted or deserted, accounting for more than a quarter of the enemy's total strength. In September, the 49th Division was transferred to the Northeast; the 21st Division, which took over the defense, was formed by replenishment after being largely annihilated in Central Jiangsu last year, and its quantity and quality were extremely poor. In addition, the 59th Brigade of the 4th Reorganized Division, originally stationed in Huaiyin, northern Jiangsu, was transferred to Baoying. Although the enemy's total strength in Central Jiangsu is still around 70,000 men, they have rarely mobilized in the past two months. With the military failures of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, their morale has become even more depressed. Less than a month after the Yancheng Campaign, more than 800 people deserted. On the way to Shanghai, the 49th Division had over a hundred Chiang soldiers who, unwilling to go to the Northeast to die, preferred to commit suicide by jumping into the river. A part of the Chiang army in Hai (men) Qi (dong) was swept away by us and driven into the Yangtze River, drifting on the water, and still dared not return. The arrogant arrogance of the enemy during the "encirclement and suppression" in March and the "rigid suppression" in May has disappeared forever. Conversely, the people's armed forces have gained rapid development. Comparing several battles: In the Shenzao Campaign in January, the battle lasted two days and one night, annihilating more than 400 enemy troops, with an enemy-to-our casualty ratio of two to one. In the Libao Campaign in April, the battle lasted one day and one night, annihilating more than 800 enemy troops (excluding peripheral battles), with an enemy-to-our casualty ratio of six to one. In the Yancheng Campaign in August, from the start of the general attack to the end, it took only eight hours, annihilating more than 2,500 enemy troops (excluding the achievements of friendly forces not belonging to Central Jiangsu), with an enemy-to-our casualty ratio of ten to one. In the Sanyangzhen battle in the 9th Sub-district (Xiangtong, Ru, Hai, Qi four counties) in late August, a battle record of annihilating more than 850 enemy troops with an enemy-to-our ratio of twenty-five to one was created. Comparing the seizures: In January, 20 machine guns and more than 350 long and short guns were seized, and 20 strongholds were captured. In April, 148 machine guns and 1,696 long and short guns were seized, and 56 strongholds were captured. In August, 174 machine guns and 2,342 long and short guns were seized, and 73 strongholds were captured. In summary, these are all signs of the improvement of our army's combat effectiveness. Secondly, the areas controlled by the enemy and ourselves have also undergone significant changes. The majority of the areas in the seven counties of Nantong, Rudong, Haimen, Qidong, Rugao, Taixing, and Taizhou, which have been repeatedly "encircled and suppressed," "mopped up," and "stationed" by the enemy, have been transformed from a grid-like situation divided by the enemy into large central areas. In the eastern part of Liangtai and the western part of Rugao, which the Chiang army had long occupied and established special agent rule, four-fifths were restored, reaching more than 3,000 square li, and liberating more than 500,000 people during the march in August. The Jiang (du) Gao (鄄) Bao (ying) area has also ended the guerrilla penetration situation and is moving towards taking root and establishing itself. The eastern part of Jingjiang, which had been occupied for seven months, has also established a people's armed guerrilla base. The army and people of Dongtai further compressed the Chiang army to a few points and lines, recovering one-half of the lost land on both sides of the Tongyu Highway, reaching 120 villages; and during the Yancheng Campaign, they controlled about 50 li of the Anliu Jiang section of the highway, making it impossible for the Chiang army to travel by car for seven days.
    Finally, the reporter pointed out: Although the Chiang army in Central Jiangsu has declined, it still retains a certain number of troops. Therefore, the basic situation in Central Jiangsu has not ended the stage of persisting in fighting in place. The enemy may still concentrate its forces on strategic locations on both sides of the transportation lines to carry out desperate struggles. For example, the 21st Division is currently preparing to make trouble. The entire Central Jiangsu is developing its strength in a proactive manner, preparing to annihilate a greater amount of the enemy's living forces, in order to cooperate with the overall counter-offensive, and advance from recovering lost territory to expanding the liberated areas.

　　苏中形势进入新阶段
  　蒋匪兵力削弱我军战力日强广大游击地区走向生根立足
    【新华社华中一日电】苏中分社记者评述目前苏中形势称：自盐城战役与全国大反攻开始以来，苏中蒋我解放区形势已进入新阶段。这首先表现在敌我力量的对比，已起显著变化。三月间，敌在苏中总兵力，为正规军两个整编师（即四师、四十九师共五个旅，其中缺四师之五十九旅），伪逆军三个团（郝逆残部两个团，伪军徐容部一个团）及蒋记省县保安部队共七十六个中队。共计约八万人。在四月迄今之五个半月中，已被歼一万六千余人，反正与逃亡五千余人，达敌总兵力四分之一强。九月，四九师调赴东北；接防的廿一师，为去年在苏中大部被歼后补充而成，数量与质量均极差。此外，将原驻苏北淮阴之整四师五十九旅调来宝应。目前苏中敌人总兵力虽仍有七万人左右，但近两月来，很少出动。随着蒋匪军事失败，士气更为沮丧。盐城战役后不到一个月，即逃亡八百余人。四九师调沪途中，百余蒋兵不愿去东北送死，宁愿投江自杀。海（门）启（东）蒋军一部为我扫荡，驱入长江，飘泊水面，迄今不敢回窜。敌在三月“会剿”、五月“硬性清剿”时之嚣张气焰，已一去不复返了。相反的，人民武装力量，则获得猛烈发展。以几个战役来比较：一月沈灶战役，战斗两昼一夜，歼敌四百余人，敌我伤亡为二比一。四月李堡战役，战斗一昼夜，歼敌八百余人（外围战斗不计），敌我伤亡为六比一。八月盐城战役，从总攻开始到结束只八小时，歼敌两千五百余人（不属苏中之友事战绩在外），敌我伤亡为十比一。九分区（象通、如、海、启四县）地于八月下旬之三阳镇战斗，更创敌我二十五比一歼敌八百五十余人之战例。以缴获比较：一月份缴机枪二十挺，长短枪三百五十余支，克据点二十处。四月份缴获机枪一百四十八挺，长短枪一千六百九十六支，克据点五十六处。八月缴获机枪一百七十四挺，长短枪二千三百四十二支，克据点七十三处。综此，均为我军战力提高之标志。其次，敌我控制地区，亦起显著变化。经敌反复“会剿”“兜剿”“驻剿”之南通、如（皋）东、海门、启东、如皋、泰兴、泰州七县，大部地区均由被敌分割之格子网局面，变成大块中心区。蒋军曾长期占据并建立特务统治之两泰东部及如皋西部，八月进军中，即恢复四分之三，达三千余方里，解放人民五十余万。江（都）高（鄄）宝（应）地区亦已结束游击穿插局面，走向生根立足。被占达七个月的靖江东部地区，也已经建立人民武装游击根据地。东台军民更压缩蒋军至少数点线，复该段通榆公路两侧失地二分之一，达一百二十村；并在盐城战役中，控制该公路安刘蒋段约五十里，使蒋军无法乘车达七天之久。
    最后记者指出：苏中蒋军虽已走下坡路了，但它还存留一定数量的兵力。故苏中基本形势尚未结束坚持原地斗争阶段。敌人仍可能在交通线两侧战路要地集中兵力，进行绝望的挣扎。如廿一日即正在准备蠢动。全苏中正以积极姿态，发展力量，准备更大量地歼灭敌人有生力量，以配合全场大反攻，由收复失地进而扩大解放区。
