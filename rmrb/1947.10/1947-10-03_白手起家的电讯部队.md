　　A Telecommunications Force Built From Scratch
    Liu
    All sorts of exciting news are now spreading faster and faster.
    Thinking about how these messages can be spread so rapidly, we can't help but thank the telecommunications force that helps the border region to be well-informed. They are loyally serving the people of the border region on the wireless front. They, like the soldiers in the hail of bullets, have shed their sweat and blood.
    The process of this force growing from nothing to something, from small to large, over the past ten years is a story of starting from scratch.
    (I)
    It is something everyone knows that at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, when the Eighth Route Army (i.e., the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army) marched into the enemy's rear in North China, using scientific and mobile guerrilla warfare to resist the invasion of Japanese imperialism, it would have been unimaginable to defeat the modernly equipped enemy without scientific telecommunications and command. At that time, the entire Eighth Route Army had less than X radio stations, and wired telecommunications were out of the question. According to the needs of the war, it had to be expanded dozens or hundreds of times rapidly to be useful. At that time, the conditions we faced were: no people (telecommunications personnel), no machines, and no money. Although the Chiang Kai-shek headquarters, which resolutely opposed communism and the people, possessed vast resources, they would never supplement the troops that resolutely resisted Japan. But in the face of the communists, these difficulties did not hinder their progress, and they created everything with their own hands.
    In the spring of 1938, the Eighth Route Army Headquarters and the 129th Division Headquarters successively established training teams, training more than 300 telecommunications personnel. The soldiers of the troops also obtained machine "supplements" from the hands of Japanese imperialism. Of course, the enemy would never "supplement" us with any complete telecommunications machines, but our telecommunications comrades highly demonstrated their wisdom and creativity. After careful research and modification, the captured broken equipment became a powerful tool for troop command and communication. Relying solely on captures could not overcome the difficulties of lacking many materials. Thus, the machine maintenance comrades began to manually assemble various urgently needed parts. All sorts of miracles, such as self-made yarn-wrapped wire, coils, machines, gears, etc., emerged one after another. Purchasing parts that were really impossible to manufacture accounted for only one-tenth of the total value. Relying on self-confidence and effort, by 1943, the number of troop radio stations had increased to XX, and radio stations were deployed from the division level down to the regiment level. The telegraph operators working on these "specially made" radio stations similarly demonstrated the supreme glory of proletarian fighters overcoming all difficulties. Although they were often maneuvering with the enemy in the environment of eight years of guerrilla warfare, sometimes surrounded by the enemy, or taking the initiative to surround the enemy, they were still able to set up lines and work in short intervals. Sometimes, they completed their tasks tensely on the mountainside or in the sorghum fields, or in the midst of violent storms. We did not have modern line-laying tools. Many times, they worked in a deep ditch, setting up antennas on the cliffs on both sides. If they encountered the most critical time of the war, they would painfully burn the documents to prevent the wavelength callsign from falling into the hands of the enemy, and then gloriously sacrifice themselves along with the machines. These telegraph operator comrades knew that the machines were not easy to obtain, so they cherished them as if they cherished their own lives. During the great sweep in May 1942, General Zuo Quan heroically sacrificed himself. Several telegraph operators and dynamo operators who shared the same radio station as General Zuo Quan still risked their lives, breaking through the enemy's heavy encirclement, and carried the radio station out completely. A telegraph operator in Taihang, when he broke through the encirclement with the machine on his back, had only one thought in his mind: "Anyway, if the machine is here, I am here; if the machine dies, I die!" This is a common oath of all telegraph operators to cherish their machines! In the plain base areas, operating within the enemy's grid network, our radio stations were sometimes set up in tunnels near enemy strongholds, sometimes in field trenches. The speed of setting up and dismantling lines was less than five minutes. The most cruel thing was that the radio stations were simply set up in the enemy's strongholds for covert work. Later, many captured documents completely proved that the enemy in North China deeply felt fear due to the heavy blow of the Eighth Route Army's guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. Then, every fighter in this telecommunications force deserves credit.
    After the Japanese surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group began the heinous civil war offensive. This incompetent transportation captain completely gave the telecommunications machines that his Yankee daddy had aided the civil war to the People's Liberation Army. As a result, this telecommunications force also expanded rapidly, and a large number of communications schools were established to train telecommunications personnel. The number of radio stations increased from XX to XXX. The new American "V101," "V100," and "284" transceivers became widely used by the People's Liberation Army. Utilizing a large number of captured machine materials, the telecommunications force established its own assembly and manufacturing factories. These manufacturing and assembly departments, which started from scratch, can now produce XX machines with the same circuit and sound at a time. And the batteries we manufacture are better than all other miscellaneous brands of batteries, second only to the famous "Everyready" brand batteries.
    The high spirit of serving the people and the creative enthusiasm of self-reliance have greatly improved the technical level of this force. In 1946, after months of dedicated research, they converted a captured machine into the nationally renowned Handan Broadcasting Station. For the birth of this radio station, the machine technicians led by Comrade Wang Shiguang worked intensely for twelve hours every day. Finally, Comrade Wang Shiguang became ill from overwork, but he did not stop working. He moved his bed next to the machine and continued his research. Many people advised him to stop working temporarily, but he refused. He said, "It is my shame to stop working because of my body!"
    It should also be specially mentioned that over the past ten years, this telecommunications force has also powerfully helped the development of the border region's news media. They supplied the border region with telecommunications personnel and machines for four quarto-sized letterpress newspapers and one broadsheet letterpress newspaper. Relying on these machines, the 30 million people in the border region could promptly hear all kinds of news from home and abroad, and the various construction projects in the border region could also be promptly disseminated to the whole country and the world.
    (II)
    With the rapid development of radio, the border region's long-distance wired telecommunications also began to be erected under the most difficult conditions in Taihang and Taiyue around 1942. At that time, we were surrounded by the enemy. We did not have wires and machines, and we still only took them from Japanese imperialism. At that time, according to statistics, the army and the masses in Pinghan and other places in the border region captured and harvested a minimum of 150,000 to 200,000 catties of electric wire that year. In order to prevent the enemy from making surprise attacks and sweeps, the erection of long-distance telephone lines at that time did not follow the main roads and plains, but rather passed through large mountains and cliffs. On some large mountains, many over-mountain flying lines were even erected, and each flying line required the strength of more than a hundred people to erect. Most of our wires were cut from the enemy, and we had to patiently piece them together during erection. Often, a hundred miles of wire had thousands of joints. This long-distance telephone line, which stretched for more than X ten thousand li, extended to places four or five li away from the enemy's bunkers. Telephone operators became the border region people's frontline sentries. They cooperated with the local troops' reconnaissance personnel to report all enemy actions to the rear command. Especially during the great sweeps in May of 1942 and 1943, all telecommunications cadres and telephone operators were dispersed to various branch offices, communications teams, and intelligence stations, stubbornly maneuvering with the enemy and insisting on intelligence communication and liaison in various places. In many cases, the village government and the masses had moved, but the communications personnel still persisted in communications work with the three or five militiamen in the village, constantly transmitting intelligence to the command. The enemy entered the village from the east, and the telephone operators exited the village from the west. When they reached the mountains, they put up the machine again and reported the enemy's actions to the rear. Over the past few years, the various government agencies and the masses have been able to skillfully move during the enemy's repeated sweeps, so that the enemy often found nothing. Telephone communications work played a huge role. However, not a few loyal telephone personnel heroically sacrificed themselves because of this. As for the telephone operators braving wind, frost, rain, and snow, climbing mountains and ridges, and checking and repairing lines day and night in the severe winter and scorching summer, their difficult situation cannot be fully described in a short article.
    After the Anti-Japanese Counter-Offensive, long-distance telephones in Jinnan and Jiluyu also began to be erected. Because our army adopted large-scale mobile warfare in the Patriotic Self-Defense War, a large number of troops were often concentrated for combat on the same front. Therefore, wired telecommunications played an even greater role in directly commanding combat. In the past two years, the long-distance telephones in the four strategic areas of Taihang, Taiyue, Jinnan, and Jiluyu have rapidly increased to more than X13,000 li. At this time, the Japanese Kou transportation team was replaced by the Jiangmei transportation team to deliver all kinds of erection equipment to us in batches. In the Longhai Campaign alone, they "sent" us more than a thousand catties of American-style jacketed wire, and other telephone components were too numerous to mention. Two-thirds of the personnel of this large telecommunications force were scattered on the front line. They often carried wires and charged with the soldiers. Five minutes after the assault squad climbed the city wall, the telephone line to the command post was connected. Sometimes, the telephone operators wrapped the wires around their bodies and rolled over the area blockaded by enemy fire to connect the lines. In the most tense moments, the telephone operators used both hands to hold the broken wires to allow the current to pass through their bodies to ensure smooth telephone communication. Large-scale mobile warfare and annihilation warfare militarily require telecommunications work to be very rapid and urgent. The telephone soldiers on the front line can resolutely complete their tasks. Even during rapid marches, they can dismantle the lines on one side and erect new lines on the other side. Due to scientific division of labor and the use of new tools, they have increased the erection level to ten to thirteen li per hour, which is faster than a person's empty walk. Now, the entire telephone erection of a column on the front line takes only two hours at the slowest, and the fastest has already reached the point where the commander dismounts and talks on the phone. The destruction of the Jiang Bandit's Second Rapid Column this spring was characterized by the enemy running fast and being annihilated quickly. The telephone soldiers of our pursuing and destroying troops dismantled the lines three times and erected the lines three times in this rapid operation, ensuring smooth military command and cleanly and thoroughly annihilating the enemy. In the famous Dayanghu Annihilation Battle, Shaoerzhai Annihilation Battle, the Guangfu Tangyin Siege Battle, and the victories of the Taiyue Liberation of Quwo, Jiangyang, Fenyang, and Xiaoyi, the telephone ensured timely and smooth command, which was an important link. Radio workers also completed their tasks equally brilliantly in these battles. General Liu Bocheng once made such a compliment at a cadre meeting: "Without good communication and liaison, there is no way to talk about command. The thorough annihilation of the enemy in the previous battle on the front line was also due to the good communication and liaison work."
    Now, the long-distance telephones erected in the border region have reached more than X13,000 li. Eighty percent of the more than 160 county towns and major market towns in the entire region (except for a few county towns in Jiluyu that are being planned and have not yet been connected) have telephone service. Such a dense telecommunications organization makes the border region particularly sensitive.
    (III)
    At present, the telecommunications force is indeed a huge team. They have more than X ten thousand people. They are active on the front line, in the rear, and in every corner every day. In order to quickly overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and for the early victory of the national counter-offensive, this communications force is currently working hard for this great historical action. All the staff of the village materials factory have launched a work contribution campaign. Every comrade is busy working for twelve hours every day, and some are even so busy that they have not slept for a day. It was estimated that the X radio stations to be assembled for the Liu-Deng army within a month were completed by 300 percent as scheduled. The assembly of XX machines, which was originally planned to take fifteen days, was completed in five days. The installation of a certain weapon has also been successful. In the past six months, the assembly section has exceeded the task by 100 percent, and the last three months have exceeded the first three months by one time. And the telephone operators have shown their inherent glorious tradition for the great counter-offensive. When the Liu-Deng army crossed the river, the speed of setting up lines exceeded 60 li (long distance) every day. The army advanced 500 li, and the telephone lines were erected for 500 li.
    ...
    For this border region telecommunications force, which has fought heroically for ten years, growing from nothing to something and from small to large, we can only end with a section of Vice Commander Teng's speech at their celebration meeting. Vice Commander Teng said: "Although we are in a rural environment and a combat environment, our communications work has made amazing progress. We have such great achievements, which are worth being proud of. ... Whether it was capturing Zhao Xitian, Liu Guangxin, Li Shouzheng, or other senior generals of the Jiang army, our telephone communications force played a great role. I want to thank the comrades in the communications department for their strong support!"

　　白手起家的电讯部队
    柳
    各种令人兴奋的消息，现在传播得愈来愈快了。
    想到这些消息能够如此飞速的传播，我们就不能不感谢这支帮助边区耳目灵通的电信部队了。他们在有无线电的战线上，忠诚的为边区人民服务。他们和枪林弹雨中的战士一样，曾经流了自己的汗也洒了自己的血。
    十年来这支部队由无到有，由小到大的过程，就是一个白手起家的故事。
    （一）
    这是每个人都知道的，在抗日战争之初，当八路军（即中国工农红军）挺进华北敌后，用科学机动的游击战去抵抗日本帝国主义进攻的时候，我们若是没有科学的电讯联络和指挥，最后要想打败现代装备的敌人，那简直是不可想象的。当时整个八路军的无线电台还不到×部，有线电更是一点都谈不上。按着战争的需要，必须几十倍和几百倍的迅速扩大起来才能够用。那时摆在面前的条件：是没有人（电信人员），没有机器和没有钱；坚决反共反人民的蒋介石统帅部虽然拥有庞大的资源。他们是绝不补充坚决抗日的部队的；但是在共产党人面前，这些困难并未阻碍他们的前进，他们就用自己的双手来创造一切了。
    一九三八年春天，八路军总部和一二九师师部，先后成立了教导队，训练电务人员三百余人。部队的战士们也从日本帝国主义的手里获得机器的“补充”。当然敌人是从不会“补充”我们任何完整的电信机器的，但我们的电信工作同志们，却高度的发挥了自己的智慧和创造力，经过细密的研究改装之后，缴获的破缺器材，就成为部队指挥联络的利器了。专靠缴获，是不能克服许多器材缺乏的困难的，于是机务员同志们，就开始用手工来装造各种急需的零件了。各种自制纱包线、线圈、机器、齿轮……等各色各样的奇迹，都一一涌现出来，实在无法制造的购买零件，仅占总值十分之一。依靠着自信和努力，到了一九四三年，部队无线电台已增加至××部，从师到团都配置起无线电台来。在这些“特制”的电台上工作的报务员同志们，他们同样表现出无产阶级战士克服一切困难的无上光辉。虽然在八年游击战争的环境中，他们经常与敌人周旋，有时被敌人包围，或主动去包围敌人，但他们仍能在短促的空隙，架起线来工作，有时在战斗的半山上或高粱地里，或在狂风暴雨中，都照样紧张的完成了任务。我们没有现代的架线工具，许多时候他们就在一条深沟里工作，而把天线架在两边的山崖上，若是遇到战争最危急的时候，他们便忍痛烧毁了文件，不使波长呼号落到敌人的手里，然后与机器一道光荣的牺牲了。这些报务员同志，他们深知机器得来是不容易的，因此就象爱护自己的生命一样去爱护它，四二年五月大扫荡中，左权将军英勇的牺牲了，和左权将军电台共存亡的几位报务员和摇机员同志，仍然冒着生命的危险，突出敌人重重包围，完整的把电台背了出来。太行一位报务员，当他背着机子突围时，他只抱着一个念头：“反正机器在我在，机器死我死！”这就是所有报务员爱护自己机器的一个共同誓词呵！在平原根据地，在敌人的格子网内活动，我们的电台有时架在敌人据点附近的地道内，有时架在野外濠沟，架线撤线的速度不用五分钟，最残酷的把电台简直架在敌人据点内隐蔽的工作。以后许多缴获的文件完全证明了华北的敌人，由于敌后八路军游击战争的沉重打击，而深深的感到了恐惧。那么，这支电讯部队的每一个战士，是有功劳的。
    日寇投降后，蒋介石反动集团开始了罪恶的内战进攻，这个无能的运输队长，把他洋爸爸援助内战的的电讯机器，都完整的送给人民解放军了，因之这支电讯部队也飞速扩大了，并成立了大批训练电讯人员的通信学校，电台由××部增加至×××部，美国新式“Ｖ１０１”“Ｖ１００”“２８４”收发报机，都普遍为人民解放军所使用起来。利用大批缴获的机器材料，电讯部队成立了自己装配制造的工厂，这些白手起家的制造和装配部门，现在一次可生产××部同样线路同样声音的机器了；而我们制造的电池，已比外来一切杂牌电池还要好，而仅次于有名的“永备牌”电池。
    高度为人民服务的精神与自力更生的创造热情，使这支部队的技术水平大为提高。一九四六年，他们经过数月的埋头研究，把一部缴获的机器改装成了闻名全国的邯郸广播电台，为了这个电台的诞生，以王士光同志为首的机师同志们，每天都紧张的工作到十二小时，最后王士光同志勤劳得病倒了，但他还没有停止工作，仍把床抬到机器旁边继续进行研究，不少的人劝告他暂时停止工作，也却拒绝。他说：“因为身体而停止工作，这是我的耻辱！”
    还应特别提到的是十年来，这支电讯部队也有力的帮助了边区新闻事业的发展，他们供给了边区四个四开铅印报和一个对开铅印报纸的电讯人员机器，依靠这些机器，边区三千万人民可以及时听到国内外的各种消息，边区的各种建设也可由此及时传播到全国和全世界去。
    （二）
    随着无线电的迅速发展，边区长途有线电也从四二年前后在最困难的条件下从太行太岳开始架设。当时我们处在敌人重重包围当中，我们没有电线和机子，仍然只有取之于日本帝国主义，那时边区平汉等地，据统计，那年军队和群众缴获收割的电线，最低限度都在十五万斤到二十万斤。为了防止敌人奔袭扫荡的破坏，当时长途电线的架设，都没有沿着大道和平川，而是经过大山和悬崖，在有的大山上，甚至架设着许多条过山飞线，每一飞线，都须经过百余人的力量才能架设起来。我们的电线大部是割来的，架设时还得耐心的拼凑，常常一百里的线，接头之多为数数千。这支长达×万余里的长途电线，一直伸展到离敌人碉堡四五里的地方，电话员就成了边区人民最前线的哨兵，他们配合着地方部队的侦察人员，把敌人的一切行动报告后方司令机关，特别是在四二、四三两年的五月大扫荡中，所有电信干部和电话员，都分散到各支局、各通信组、各情报站，顽强的与敌人周旋、坚持各地的情报通信联络，在许多时候，往往村中机关和群众都转移了，而通信人员仍与村中三五民兵在村坚持通信工作，不断向司令机关传达情报，敌人由东面进村，电话员就从西面出村，到了山上，又搭上机了，向后方报告敌人行动。几年来，各机关群众，在敌人反复扫荡中，能够巧妙的转移，使敌人经常扑空，电话通信工作，起了极大的作用，然而忠于职守的电话人员，因此而英勇牺牲者为数不少。至于在严冬酷暑，电话员冒风霜雨雪，爬山越岭，不分昼夜的查线修线，其艰苦情形，更非短小篇幅所能罄书的。
    抗日大反攻后，冀南、冀鲁豫的长途电话亦开始架设。由于在爱国自卫战争中，我军采取大规模的运动战，往往在一个战线上，同时就集中了大量的兵力作战，因之有线电在直接指挥作战上，又起了更大的作用，两年来太行、太岳、冀南、冀鲁豫四个战略区的长途电话，迅速增设到×万三千余华里，这时成批送给我们各种架设器材的，由日寇运输队，换成蒋美运输队了，仅陇海一役，他们“送”给我们的美式被复线即达千余斤，其他电话机件更是不胜枚举。这支庞大的电信部队，三分之二的人员都散布在火线上，他们常常背着电线和战士一齐冲锋，在突击班登城五分钟后，通往指挥所的电话即架通了。有的时候电话员就把电线缠在自己身体上，滚过敌人火力封锁的地带去接线，而在最紧张时，电话员使用两手拉住断了的电线，使电流通过身体，以保证电话的畅通。大规模的运动战和歼灭战，军事上要求电信工作常常是很迅速急迫的，战斗在前线的电话兵，他们都能坚决完成任务，即使在快速的行军中，他们也能一面撤线，一面架设起新的线路来，由于科学的分工及新式工具之运用，他们每小时已把架设水平提高到十里到十三里，比起一个人的空走路还要来得快。现在前线一个纵队的全部电话架设，最慢的也只须用两小时，最快的已经作到首长下马通话了。今春蒋匪第二快速纵队的毁灭，特点是敌人跑得快，也被歼灭得快，我们追灭部队的电话兵，曾在这次快速的作战中，三次撤线三次架线，保证了顺畅的军事指挥，干净彻底的歼灭了敌人。有名的大杨湖歼灭战、邵耳寨歼灭战、光复汤阴攻坚战以及太岳解放曲沃、绛阳、汾阳、孝义诸战役的胜利，电话保证了及时顺畅的指挥，是一个重要的环节，而无线电工作者，也在这些战役中，同样卓越的完成了任务。刘伯承将军在一次干部会上曾作过这样夸奖的说：“没有好的通信联络，就根本谈不上指挥，前方那次战役彻底歼灭了敌人，通信联络工作也就是作得很好。”
    现在边区架设的长途电话，已经长达×万三千余华里，全区一百六十多个县城及各大集镇（除冀鲁豫少数县城正在筹架尚未通话外），十分之八，已通话了。目前太行太岳两区的有线电报亦已通行，这样密如蛛网的电信组织，就使边区的耳目特别灵敏起来了。
    （三）
    目前电信部队确是一支庞大的队伍，他们拥有×万多人，他们每天都活动在前线、后方以及各个角落，为了迅速打倒蒋介石，为了全国大反攻的早日胜利，这支通信部队，目前正为这一伟大历史行动而努力。村料厂全体人员已经举行了献工运动，每个同志，每天工作都忙到十二个小时，有的更忙得一天都没有睡觉。预计一个月内装配给刘邓大军的×部电台，竟如期完成了百分之三百，××机器的装配，原计十五天的任务，五天内即突击完成了。某种武器的装置亦已成功。半年来装配科即超过任务百分之百，后三个月更超过前三个月的一倍。而电话员们，更为大反攻而表现了自己固有的光荣传统，当刘邓大军过河时，架线的速度，每天竟超过六十里（长途），大军前进五百里，电话也就架好了五百里。
    ……
    对于这支英勇奋斗了十年，由无到有由小到大的边区电信部队，我们最后只能引用滕副司令员在他们庆功大会上的讲演的一节来作为结束，滕副司令员说：“虽然处在农村环境，战斗环境，但我们的通信工作却作到惊人的发展，我们有这样大的成绩，是值得自豪的。……不论捉赵锡田、刘广信、李守正和其他蒋军高级将官，我们的电话通信部队，都起了很大的作用，我要感谢通信部门的同志对我们的大力支持！”
