Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th. The East China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China, the Shandong Provincial Assembly, the Shandong Provincial Government, and the Headquarters of the East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army solemnly announced on the 6th of this month the passing of Elder Fan Mingshu, Speaker of the Shandong Provincial Assembly. The 84-year-old Elder Fan suffered a recurrence of an old illness on September 21st in a certain area of ​​Bohai, followed by a lapse into unconsciousness. Although doctors were immediately called for treatment, he ultimately succumbed to his advanced age and accumulated fatigue, and the medicine proved ineffective. He passed away at 8:30 AM on the 2nd of this month. When the sad news spread, the people of the entire province mourned in unison. The Provincial Government and the East China Military Region have instructed all localities that, starting from the 12th of this month, all agencies, troops, and schools will fly flags at half-mast for one day and cease entertainment for three days to express their sorrow. Preparations for a funeral committee are underway in Shandong.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th. Chen, Zhang, Rao, Li, and other leaders of the East China Military Region, along with all commanders and soldiers, have sent a telegram of condolence to the family of Elder Fan Mingshu, Speaker of Shandong Province. The original telegram is as follows: To the family of the late Speaker Fan, c/o the Luzhong Military Region: Just as our armies are marching south into the Central Plains, and the national counter-offensive is unfolding, and as Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's "key offensive" against Shandong has failed, and it faces total collapse, Elder Fan has passed away. Upon hearing the sad news, the entire army is in mourning. Elder Fan was a revolutionary elder, a prominent figure in Qilu, of high moral standing, and revered by the people. During the War of Resistance, he was imprisoned by the enemy, and despite threats and inducements, he remained loyal and unyielding, fighting heroically, and his integrity was awe-inspiring. He was truly the glory of our Party and the people. Elder Fan toiled throughout his life, hoping to enjoy his remaining years after the victory of the War of Resistance. However, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang launched a criminal civil war, harming the people, causing Elder Fan to ultimately pass away amidst the sounds of artillery fire. Our entire army of soldiers will inherit Elder Fan's legacy, resolutely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and expand the victory of the counter-offensive to comfort his spirit. We sincerely hope that your family will restrain your grief. Victory is in sight, and we will move forward together. We hereby send our condolences. Signed, Chen Yi, Commander of the East China Military Region, Zhang Yunyi, Deputy Commander, Rao Shushi, Political Commissar, Li Yu, Deputy Political Commissar, on behalf of all commanders and soldiers.
