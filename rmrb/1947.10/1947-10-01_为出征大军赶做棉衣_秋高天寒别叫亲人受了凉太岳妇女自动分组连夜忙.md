　　Making Cotton Clothes for the Expeditionary Army
  　As Autumn Deepens and the Weather Turns Cold, Let's Not Let Our Loved Ones Suffer; Women in the Taiyue Region Voluntarily Organize Into Groups and Work Through the Night
　　[Our Taiyue Dispatch, 29th] After the Chen-Xie army set out on their expedition, women in various regions are rushing to make winter clothing for the soldiers on the front lines. For example, in Changcun, after the district office issued a mobilization order, people were sent to collect cotton and cloth on the same day. After supper, village cadres first discussed sewing methods, organizing all the women in the village, dividing the work collectively, with skilled people cutting the cloth and those less skilled doing the rough work. After this news spread, the women made preparations voluntarily. Those with children nursed them and put them to sleep, waiting at home, and some went to the village office to inquire several times, very anxious. After the gathering gong sounded, all 320 women in the village quickly gathered at the village office, combined according to the assigned groups, carrying cotton and cloth, moving quickly. Cadres ran back and forth, adding oil to the lamps and telling everyone about the victorious news of the great counter-offensive. Everyone forgot their drowsiness and fatigue; while sewing, they asked questions. Eighth squad leader Lu Xianhua jokingly said in a ballad: "Seeing that the autumn is high and the weather is getting cold, my man is fighting old Chiang on the front line, quickly sew and send it quickly, don't let him suffer from the cold." This caused everyone to burst into laughter, and someone said: "You really love your man!" In such a tense and pleasant working environment, one hundred and thirty pairs of pants were completely made by midnight. The next day, students from the two complete schools competed to deliver winter clothing to each village, which made the principal helpless and had to select 32 taller students to carry hundreds of pairs of military pants. On August 29th, braving the rain and barefoot, they delivered them directly to the supply station. In other places such as Yangcheng and Qinshui, cotton shoes have been made and sent to Henan.
　　[Our Jincheng Dispatch] The masses in the Dongdayang Town of the Second District support the great counter-offensive, supplying everything to the front lines in a timely manner, working day and night to complete the 1.4 million burden quota and 871 pairs of military shoes in seven days. Town leader Han Zhihong first announced the meritorious service plan formulated in the district and the conditions for competition among the villages at the mass meeting, discussing "How to complete this task ahead of schedule?" The masses proposed: "Not to be left behind, to seize the first merit!" Cooperative manager Xue Lu and others proposed: "For the great counter-offensive, we must supply everything to the front lines in a timely manner, and we also want to earn merits. The cooperative will provide all the materials for the burden quota and military shoes in advance. Everyone can earn money through production to repay or transport them to the cooperative, and women can spin cotton for the cooperative to repay." The women first reviewed the past mistakes of making military shoes "supporting public affairs, just getting by", and then discussed "Men are joining the war to earn merits, how can we earn merits?" "Who are we making military shoes for?" The women proposed at the meeting: this time we will also "fire the first shot and occupy the first merit" for the military shoes! The slogan is: "Be fast, be good, and be practical!" Everyone set a meritorious service plan challenge, and everyone was afraid of being left behind without their names on the merit book. Working day and night, all 871 pairs of military shoes were completed in seven days and personally selected and carried to the district warehouse.
　　In addition, Li Tianhua, chairman of the Women's Federation of the Second District Baofu, and Vice Chairman Wang Gaixiu, first went deep into individual mobilization, and then convened a full village women's mobilization meeting, voluntarily combining into eight groups, each group of about 20 people, scrambling to report and grab the work. Even the old ladies in their sixties and seventies were afraid of being left behind, and the activist Guo Laishi, who was ill, volunteered to make two pairs of shoes. When making them, they did what they could, helping each other. In this case of voluntary reporting and mutual assistance, 200 of the 249 pairs of military shoes have been completed in eleven days, made quickly and well. The Second District Meritorious Service Committee specially notified the entire district, commending Dongdayang and Baofu villages. (Wang Yi)

　　为出征大军赶做棉衣
  　秋高天寒别叫亲人受了凉太岳妇女自动分组连夜忙
    【本报太岳二十九日电】在陈谢大军出征后，各地妇女为前方将士赶制寒衣。如常村在区公所动员令下来后，当天就派人去领回花和布，吃罢夜饭，先由村干部讨论了缝的办法，将全村妇女组织起来，集体分工，巧人剪裁，手笨的做粗活。这消息传出后，妇女自动作了准备，有小孩的把小孩奶的睡了，在家等着，有的到村公所打探几回，着急的很，在集合的锣声响后，全村三百二十个妇女，迅速齐集村公所，按分好的小组，结合起来，背花的背花，拿布的拿布，急速地动作起来，干部跑来跑去，一面给拨灯添油，一面给大家说大反攻的胜利消息，大家忘记了瞌睡，忘记了疲劳；一边缝，一边问，八班长鲁先花玩笑地说起板话来：“眼看秋高天气凉，我汉子前线打老蒋，赶快缝成赶快送，不要叫他受了凉。”引的大家哄声大笑，有人说：“你真心疼汉子呀！”就在这样紧张愉快的工作中，半夜就把一百三十条裤子完全作起来了。第二天，两个完全学校的学生，争着要给各村送寒衣，弄得校长也没了办法，只好挑选了三十二个大个子的学生，担了几百条军裤，于八月二十九日，冒着雨，赤着脚，一直送到兵站。其他阳城、沁水等地，已将棉鞋作起，已派人送往河南。
    【本报晋城讯】二区东大阳镇群众支持大反攻，一切及时供应前线，连明搭夜在七天内将一百四十万负担款和八百七十一双军鞋全部完成。镇长韩之红在群众大会上，首先宣布了在区订的立功计划及和各村竞赛条件，讨论“如何提前完成这一任务？”群众提出：“不落人后，要抢头功！”合作社经理薛路等提出：“为了大反攻，一切及时供应前线，我们也要立功，这次负担款、军鞋材料，由合作社全部提前拿出，大家可生产赚回钱归还或给合作社运输，妇女可给合作社纺花归还。”妇女们首先检讨了过去做军鞋“支持公事，哄过就好”的毛病，又讨论了“男人参战立功，咱们怎样立功？”“做军鞋是给谁做？”妇女当会提出：这次军鞋我们也要“打头炮，占头功！”口号是：“要快、要好、要给实！”每人订出立功计划挑战，谁也怕落了后功劳簿上没有了名，连明搭夜，七天内将八百七十一双军鞋全部完成了，并亲自你挑我担送至区仓库。
    又二区保伏妇联会主席李天花、副主席王改秀，首先深入个别动员，随即召开了全村妇女动员大会，自愿结合了八个组，每组的人都是廿人左右，争先恐后自报抢着做，就是六、七十岁的老太太也怕落了后，还有积极分子郭来氏，身上有病，自报也要做鞋两双。做时看谁能做啥就做啥，在这样自报互助做的情况下，十一天内二百四十九双军鞋已完成了二百双，做的又快、又好。二区立功委员会特通报全区，表扬东大阳和保伏两村。（王毅）
