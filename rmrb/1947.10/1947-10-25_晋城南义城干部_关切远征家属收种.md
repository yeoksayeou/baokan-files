[Transmitted by] This Newspaper Taiyue, 22nd. Jincheng Nanyicheng Political Director Cheng Sanwang, Farmers' Association Chairman Li Sangu, and Military Committee Director Yue Faxi, took great care of the families of soldiers on expedition during this year's autumn harvest and planting season. The three of them would take their bowls at mealtimes and go to the homes of the families of soldiers on expedition and military martyrs to ask how the team was taking care of them. After Yue Qunfang from the Third Team went to war, his wife was worried that she wouldn't be able to harvest in the autumn or plant wheat. One day, Li Sangu went to her house and asked, "Sister-in-law Qunfang, since Brother Qunfang left, you have small children and can't do the work in the fields, right?" She said, "Old Chairman, you guessed right!" Li Sangu told her, "Don't worry!" The next day, the mutual aid team harvested for Qunfang's family and planted fifteen mu of Bailu wheat. Qunfang's wife said, "With cadres taking care of us like this, it doesn't matter whether we have a man or not!" There are many things like this. Yue Cainv from the Ninth Team went to war, and his wife wanted to plant a few mu of early wheat at home, but she didn't have wheat seeds and was too embarrassed to tell anyone. That day, Military Committee Director Yue Faxi guessed her thoughts and asked her, "Since Cainv left, you're not worried about harvesting grain or plowing the land, but you're worried about not having wheat seeds, right?" She laughed, "What else!" The cadres lent her wheat seeds and planted seven mu of wheat. Cainv's wife went to the cadres' house and said, "My family has no difficulties, I'll write a letter to Cainv and tell him to rest assured!" The wife of Si Xiaohe, a family member of a soldier on expedition from the Thirteenth Team, cried and told the cadres, "The people in the team have all threshed their grain at home, but I can't carry mine back after it's been harvested. What if it gets ruined by the rain?" Old Chairman Li Sangu immediately called a meeting of the Thirteenth Team leader and said, "It would be terrible if the grain of the family members of the soldiers on expedition gets ruined, they are on the front lines!" The team leader immediately reflected and said, "This is my mistake, I will correct it in the future, if I really ruin their grain, I will have to compensate them!" Shuangxi's mother's family had no labor, and the team didn't take good care of them. Political Director Sanwang went to her house to comfort her and said, "Old aunt, don't worry, I guarantee you'll be able to harvest and plant wheat, we are one family, whatever you say goes!" The old blind woman said, "That's good, how can I thank you?!" Sanwang said, "This is thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." The old woman said, "I've only heard about Chairman Mao, but I, a blind woman, will never be able to see him in my lifetime!" As she spoke, she began to cry. Now, under the leadership of Sanwang and others in Nancheng, everyone can plant wheat and has joined a mutual aid team.

　　晋城南义城干部
  　关切远征家属收种
    【本报太岳二十二日电】晋城南义城政治主任程三旺，农会主席李三古，武委会主任岳法喜，在今年秋收秋种中对远征家属照顾周到。他三个人每到吃饭时候就端着碗分头到远征家属军烈属家里去问候，看组里照顾的怎么样。第三组岳群方参战走后，他女人愁的怕秋收不回来，种不上麦。一天，李三古去她家，就问：“群方嫂，群方哥走后，你家孩子小，地里活做不了，你说是不是？”她说：“老主席你可算猜对啦！”李三古对她说：“不怕！”第二天，互助组就给群方家收割，并种了十五亩白露麦，群方女人说：“干部象这样照顾，有男人没男人都行！”象这类的事情很多，九组岳才女参战走了，他女人在家想种几亩早麦，可是家里没麦种，也不好意思说给旁人。那天，武委会主任岳法喜猜透她的心事，问她：“才女走后你割谷犁地都不愁，就愁的没麦种是不是？”她笑啦：“不是是啥！”干部借上麦子给种上七亩麦，才女媳妇到干部家说：“我家什困难都没有，给才女去信，叫他放心！”十三组远征家属司小和的女人，哭着找干部说：“组里人家都把谷打到家里，就是我的谷割起担不回来，雨淋了一次，沤坏怎么办？”老主席李三古即刻找十三组组长开会，说：“沤了远征家属的谷可了不起，人家是在前方的！”组长随即反省了，说：“这是我的错误，今后改正，真把人家谷沤坏我非赔不行！”双喜他娘一家没劳力，组里没照顾好，政治主任三旺同志到他家安慰说：“老婶婶，不用愁，保险你收回来种上麦，咱是一家人，说什是什！”老瞎眼说：“可是好，这叫我怎么感谢你们？！”三旺说：“这是共产党毛主席领导的好。”老婆说：“光听说毛主席毛主席，我这瞎眼今辈算见不了他老人家了！”说着，哭起来。现在南城在三旺等的领导下，不论谁都能种上麦，都参加了互助组。
