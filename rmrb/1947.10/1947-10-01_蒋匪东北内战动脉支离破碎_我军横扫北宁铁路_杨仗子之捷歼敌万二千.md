　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: Concurrent with the great victories in western Liaoning, the sons and soldiers of eastern Hebei are actively attacking the Chiang bandits along the Beining Railway. On the 20th, following the destruction of railway tracks at five locations on the Beining Railway by the local regiments of the 12th Military Sub-district and the guerrillas of Lulong, Funing, and Linyu counties – between Anshan and Yinma River west of Changli, between Xihanjiazhuang and Duanjiazhuang east of Changli, and between Caigezhuang and Nandasi and between Beidaihe and Pulanzhuang west of Qinhuangdao – on the night of the 21st, a unit of the local regiment of the 15th Military Sub-district swiftly captured Qingzhuanghu, a Chiang bandit stronghold 20 kilometers southwest of Tangshan, in just ten minutes, capturing all seventy-odd defending enemy troops of a column and seizing one machine gun and sixty-odd rifles. On the evening of the 24th, the Ninghe local armed forces, penetrating deep along the line, also raided the power distribution station of the Chiang puppet Beining Railway at Hangu Station, killing and capturing 28 enemy soldiers. Another unit of the county's local armed forces, in coordination with arriving guerrillas, harvested 3,850 catties of Chiang bandit wires and destroyed a section of railway tracks. Another unit also fiercely struck the Chiang puppet "conscript team" in the Zhongmenzhuang area eight miles south of Hanchengzhen, and that night advanced rapidly eastward, capturing a Chiang stronghold at Liujiaguodao, a suburb of Tangshan, killing and wounding some of the enemy and seizing many supplies.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 29th: The Front Headquarters of the Jireliao People's Liberation Army issued its second war bulletin: A unit of our Jireliao People's Liberation Army, on the 16th of this month, recovered Yangzhangzi, an important stronghold on the outskirts of Jinxi, annihilating a part of the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division and Provisional 50th Division, totaling more than 4,600 men. The enemy then transferred the entire 79th Division and 105th Division of the 49th Army from Jinzhou, invading Yangzhangzi again. We launched a fierce general offensive starting at 13:00 on the 21st, and by 18:00 on the 22nd, the defending enemy forces completely collapsed and fled in disarray. After our army blocked and fiercely pursued them along various routes, the entire enemy force was annihilated, with a total of over 1,000 enemy officers and soldiers killed or wounded, and a total of 10,760 enemy officers and soldiers captured (Editor's Note: The preliminary statistics reported on the 25th stated that over 6,000 enemy soldiers were captured). Among the important enemy officers captured, those whose identities have been verified include Wu Zhizhi, Chief of Staff of the 105th Division, Tao Liyu, Commander of the 315th Regiment, and Dong Bochou, Deputy Commander of the 23rd Regiment of the 79th Division. A total of 65 mountain guns and 60mm mortars, 17 grenade launchers, and 304 light and heavy machine guns were seized, along with many other spoils of war. The above statistics do not include those seized by local armed forces and militias.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 29th: A reporter recently interviewed a commander of a unit of the Jireliao People's Liberation Army at a location on the front line, comparing the Jinxi Victory with the Summer Offensive. The general told the reporter: After the training of various battles in the Summer Offensive, our army has demonstrated proficiency in tactics and combat actions in the annihilation of the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division of the 93rd Army this time. The general offensive began in just thirty minutes, disrupting the enemy's main defense system, and the flanking and encircling forces were able to integrate well with the front, quickly coordinating actions to cut off the enemy individually, forcing the enemy division headquarters to be trapped in isolated houses. Secondly, our army's courageous, rapid, and tenacious attacks were like a blacksmith's hammer constantly striking the enemy, leaving them unable to parry and even less able to fight back. For example, a certain company of the "War Flag" unit captured the enemy's fortresses in just ten minutes from the company's attack point; and the heroes of the demolition squad of the Second Company of the "War Sound" unit blew up the enemy's bunkers, killing 120 Chiang bandits without suffering any casualties themselves. Thirdly, in this battle, our enemy casualty ratio was one to seven, meaning that we have learned to achieve the greatest victory with fewer casualties and fewer bullets. Finally, and most importantly, we have begun to learn Commander Lin's "one point, two faces" tactic. In the fish-scale-like, layer upon layer of dense encirclement, the Chiang bandits have no hope of survival unless they surrender.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: A front-line reporter reports: After the Battle of Yangzhangzi, the victorious troops carried boxes of ammunition from beautiful Western-style houses and warehouses. The soldiers said with smiles, "Comrades! Carry them! One box at a time! This is Chen Cheng's greeting gift to us!" As the soldiers laughed, sang, and carried, Su Jingtai, the deputy commander of the captured Provisional 22nd Division of the 93rd Army, and Ning Jianbao, the division's chief of staff, happened to pass by. They were wearing American hats askew, with their hands in the pockets of their American-style coats, staring blankly at our column carrying ammunition. These two men, who were originally in charge of the ammunition depot, can now be considered to have completed their "gift-giving" mission. Now, the car they are sitting in is still the one they were sitting in before they were captured, but the driver is not taking them on their original route, but along the highway leading to the rear of the People's Liberation Army. On this highway, over three hundred lower-ranking Chiang army officers who have laid down their weapons, and thousands of liberated soldiers, are rejoicing in their new lives. A Yunnan soldier threw his American hat forcefully on the ground and said happily, "Throw away the American hat and move towards the people. Our days of rising up have come!"

　　蒋匪东北内战动脉支离破碎
  　我军横扫北宁铁路
  　杨仗子之捷歼敌万二千
    【新华社东北二十九日电】与辽西两次大捷同时，我冀东各地子弟兵纷纷向北宁路沿线进袭蒋匪。二十日继十二分区地方兵团及卢龙、抚宁、临榆各县游击队蒋北宁路上昌黎以西之安山至饮马河间，昌黎以东之西韩家庄至段家庄间，以及秦皇岛以西之蔡各庄至南大寺间，北戴河至浦蓝庄间等五处铁轨铁路毁坏后，二十一日夜晚十五分区地方兵团一部，以十分钟之快速攻克唐山西南二十公里之蒋匪据点青庄湖，俘守敌人纵队七十余名全部，缴获机枪一挺，步枪六十余支。二十四日晚，深入沿线的宁河地方武装亦袭入蒋伪北宁路汉沽站之配电所，毙俘敌二十八名。该县地方武装另部，配合开抵游击队收割蒋匪电线三千八百五十余斤，毁铁轨一部。另部并于韩城镇以南八里之中门庄一带，痛击蒋伪“壮丁队”后，当晚向东疾进，攻克唐山近郊之刘家过道据点一处，毙伤敌一部，缴获甚多。
    【新华社东北前线二十九日电】冀察热辽人民解放军前线指挥部发表第二号战报：我冀察热辽人民解放军一部，于本月十六日收复锦西外围重要据点杨仗子，歼敌暂二十二师及暂五十师一部共四千六百余后，敌由锦州调来四十九军之七十九师及一○五师两个师全部，再次侵入杨仗子，我于二十一日十三时开始猛烈总攻，至二十二日十八时守敌全部崩溃，狼狈回窜，我军分途堵截猛追后，敌全部被歼，共毙伤敌官兵一千余名，俘敌官兵共一万零七百六十名（编者按：二十五日电讯报导之初步统计被俘敌，为六千余人）。被俘敌重要军官已查明者，有一○五师参谋主任吴稚致，三一五团团长陶立宇，七十九师二十三团副团长董伯踌。缴获山炮、六零炮等共六十五门，掷弹筒十七个，轻重机枪三百零四挺，其他战利品甚多。上述统计，地方武装及民兵缴获者未包括在内。
    【新华社东北前线二十九日电】记者顷以锦西大捷与夏季攻势比较为题，访问冀察热辽人民解放军某部指挥员于前线某地。某将军语记者称：经过夏季攻势各次战斗的锻炼后，我军这次歼敌九十三军暂二十二师，首先表现出战术与战斗动作上的熟练。总攻开始不过三十分钟，就把敌人主要防御体系打乱，两侧包围部队亦能与正面很好结合，迅速协同动作，把敌人各别切断，使敌师部被迫困守孤房内。其次是我军勇猛迅速顽强的攻击，象打铁的铁锤一样不停的向敌人打去，使敌招架不得，更无力还手。如“战旗”部某连从连的进攻点出发，十分钟就夺取了敌人的堡垒；又如“战声”部二连爆炸组的英雄们，把敌人碉堡炸毁了还炸死蒋匪一百二十人，而自己无一损伤。第三、这次战斗我敌伤亡率是一比七，就是说我们学会了能够以更少的伤亡和更少数的弹药，取得最大的胜利。最后也是最重要的是，我们开始学会了林总司令的“一点两面”战术，在鱼鳞似的层层密密包围中，蒋匪不投降就休想活命。
    【新华社东北二十九日电】前线记者报导：杨仗子战斗结束后，胜利的部队从漂亮的洋房仓库里搬出一箱箱的弹药，战士们笑嘻嘻的说：“同志们！搬呀，一次背一箱，这都是陈诚给我们送来的见面礼呀！”当战士们笑着唱着搬着的时候，被俘的九十三军暂二十二师的副师长苏景泰，和师参谋长宁坚宝两人正好经过那儿，他俩歪戴着美国帽子，手插在美式上衣口袋里，茫然地望着我们搬运弹药的行列。这两位原来军火仓库主任的人，现在算是完成他们“送礼”的任务了。现在他们所坐的车子，仍然是被俘前他们所坐的，不过驾驶员没有把他们带上原来的路线去，而是沿着通人民解放军后方的公路上驶。在这条公路上，正进行着三百多名放下武器的下级蒋军军官，和数以千计的被解放的士兵，他们正庆幸着自己的新生。一个云南士兵把美国帽子用力的丢在地上，高兴的说：“丢掉美国帽，走向人民，我们有出头的日子了！”
