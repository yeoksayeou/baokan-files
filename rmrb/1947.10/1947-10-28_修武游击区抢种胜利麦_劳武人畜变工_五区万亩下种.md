    Seizing the Time to Plant Victory Wheat in the Xiuwu Guerrilla Area:
    Labor-Military-Human-Animal Cooperative Work,
    10,000 Mu Sown in the Fifth District
    [Report from this newspaper, Xiuwu] The liberated peasants in the Fifth District guerrilla area, under the slogan of "Winning victories on the front lines, planting more victory wheat in the rear, holding a gun in one hand and guiding the plow in the other, leaving no village vacant, leaving no person idle," have spurred the entire district's men, women, and children into a fiery wheat planting campaign.  The entire district is a guerrilla area. Enemy harassment was frequent this spring, and coupled with a lack of rain, there were very few autumn crops.  Under these circumstances, the five guerrilla administrative villages have organized large-scale labor-military-human-animal cooperative work. Young and strong people plow the fields and pull the plows, women and older children weed and cut artemisia, older women look after the children and cook, transferring early and late, with elderly squads responsible for leading the livestock, and militia persisting in the villages at night.  In production, the leadership particularly pointed out that district and village cadres and activists should lead the masses in making contributions to the wheat planting movement. Under this slogan, cadres in each village have practically participated in mutual aid teams. In particular, Comrade Jiao Huaibao, the village head of Xin'an Town, personally guided the plow, planting 20 mu of wheat every day, planting 100 mu of wheat in five days.  Comrade Qiao Nian, the village head of Nanxie Village, also participated in the plow-pulling team.  Qintun Village is close to the enemy's stronghold, and the integration of labor and military was not good. No one wanted to participate in production, with the result that the entire village of 270 people only planted a little over 30 mu of autumn crops this year, leaving the land covered with knee-high foxtail grass.  The good news of the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive constantly arrived, giving them great encouragement and strengthening the integration of labor and military. In less than ten days, they rushed to plough, harrow, and sow one thousand mu, more than doubling the amount of wheat planted by the whole village last year (500 mu were planted last year).  The entire district, from the beginning of the movement to the present, a total of five days, 10,000 mu of dry land have been completely sown.  The entire district has seventeen natural villages with two thousand seven hundred people, with an average of over four mu planted per person. Villages with more land have successfully completed plans to plant five to six mu of wheat per person. Now the district leadership has put forward a new call: "Plant one more mu of wheat, harvest one more shi of grain; plant wherever there is wasteland." In villages with wide land areas, launch the "Ten Mu of Wheat Per Person Movement." In addition, the militia rotation teams of the district have also launched a surge of combat production to solve the living difficulties of the families displaced outside. In addition to a part persisting in activities in the enemy area, the others have organized wasteland reclamation and wheat planting. Up to now, more than 100 mu of wheat have been planted, and the plan to plant a total of 200 mu is expected to be completed. If there is a bumper harvest next year, the wheat harvest of one militiaman can take care of the needs of three family members. By persisting in the struggle in this way, a part of the livelihood problem of family members can be solved. The combat morale of the militia has been greatly improved, further strengthening the will to fight. At present, the wheat planting movement in the Fifth District is proceeding tensely. (Wu Yi)

    修武游击区抢种胜利麦
    劳武人畜变工
    五区万亩下种
    【本报修武讯】五区游击区翻身农民，在“前方打胜仗，后方多种胜利麦，一手提枪，一手扶耧，不留一个空白村，不留一个空闲人”的口号下，全区男女老少已卷入热火朝天的种麦浪潮。全区都是游击区，今春敌人袭扰频繁，加之缺雨，很少秋庄稼，在这种情况下，五个游击行政村，都组织了劳武人畜力的大变工，青壮年犁地、拉耧，妇女及大一点的孩子锄草、割蒿，有年纪的妇女看孩做饭，早晚转移，由上年纪的老年班负责牵牲口，夜晚民兵在村坚持。在生产中，领导上特别指出：区村干部及积极分子，要带领群众在种麦运动中立功。在这一口号下，各村干部都实地参加了互助组，尤其新安镇村长焦怀保同志，亲自扶耧，每天种麦二十亩，五天就种麦一百亩，南谢村长乔年同志，也参加了拉耧组。秦屯村，离敌人据点近，劳武结合不好，谁也不愿参加生产，以致全村二百七十口人今年仅种秋禾三十余亩，弄的遍地是半人高的狼尾巴蒿。解放军大举反攻的喜讯不断的传来，给了他们以莫大鼓舞，加强了劳武结合，不到十天的时间，连犁带耙，加上下种，就突击了一千亩，超过了去年全村种麦数的一倍（去年种了五百亩）。全区自运动开始至现在共五天，一万亩旱地已全部下种，全区共十七个自然村，两千七百口人，大小口平均每人四亩强，土地多的村，每人种麦五亩至六亩的计划，又胜利完成。现在区领导上又提出了新的号召：“多种一亩麦，多打一石粮，有荒地就种。”在土地宽的村，发起“每口人十亩麦运动。”此外，该区民兵轮战队民兵，为解决流落在外的家属生活困难，也发起了战斗生产的热潮，除一部到敌区坚持活动外，其他即组织开荒种麦，到现在已种麦百余亩，共种二百亩的计划可望完成。如明年丰收，一个民兵的种麦收获，可顾住三口家属，如此坚持了斗争，又解决了家属的一部生活问题。民兵战斗情绪大为提高，更坚定了斗争的意志。目下，五区的种麦运动正在紧张的进行中。（吴毅）
