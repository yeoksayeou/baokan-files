To Consult with Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
　　Discussing the Mass Line with Comrade Shen Shu
　　Gao Xin

　　After reading Comrade Shen Shu’s article “Inspirations from Reading ‘Discussing Matters with the Masses’” (published on this page on September 9th), I feel that Comrade Shen's reflection, generally speaking, has cleared up a part of last year's mass movement experience, and his understanding has improved a step further, but I think it has not yet penetrated to the essence of the problem.

　　According to Comrade Shen's conclusion, "To hand over the problem to the masses for processing and let the masses carefully compare it in a collective setting," this understanding and spirit are correct, but what kind of masses should be handed over to process and compare it? I think this is the key to the problem.

　　At present, our task is basically to liberate the peasants. However, although middle and poor peasants have a consistent demand for emancipation, due to their different degrees of exploitation, their requirements and attitudes towards land reform are also different. The attitudes of the village head (middle peasant) and the chairman of the peasant association (poor peasant) towards land reform, as mentioned by Comrade Shen, demonstrate the difference between the two classes. The "almost" mentality and the peacemaking attitude demonstrate the class essence of the middle peasants; "If we don't make trouble, then so be it, but if we do, we will eradicate the roots." This demonstrates the class essence of the poor peasants. We must clarify the commonalities and contradictions between these middle and poor peasants. Since they have such different demands and attitudes, they will have different views and opinions in handling problems. In today's rural areas, due to the fact that land reform is not yet thorough, the entire poor peasant class has not been fully mobilized. If we do not distinguish between the different attitudes of middle and poor peasants towards the revolution, do not clarify that poor peasants are the basic driving force of land reform, do not regard the demands of poor peasants as the basic direction of land reform, and do not demarcate the two different classes of middle and poor peasants, but hand it over to the masses in general, then in areas and villages where poor peasants have not been well mobilized, middle peasants will dominate, and the attitude of middle peasants will be considered the basic direction of land reform, "Landlords are bad, but the village head is good" is clear evidence. Shou Zhang County's "fruits were distributed according to the rich peasant line under the majority vote (middle peasants are the majority)", which will inevitably affect and hinder the in-depth and thorough implementation of land reform. Therefore, leaders of the mass movement must clearly stand on the position of the poor peasants and support the poor peasants, and hand over the problems to the poor peasants for processing and comparison first, "all work through the poor peasants," this is the mass line. If such a guiding ideology is clarified and affirmed, then no matter how complex problems constantly arise in the mass movement, it will not waver or become confused.

　　Because middle and poor peasants have a common demand for emancipation, it is necessary to unite the middle peasants, but "poor peasants are the bones, middle peasants are the flesh," and we must take the poor peasants as the backbone, and take the opinions of the poor peasants as the center, and then obtain the consent and sympathy of the middle peasants to unite the majority. Only this poor peasant line is the guarantee of the complete victory of the democratic revolution. Chairman Mao pointed out as early as the Great Revolution: "This vast mass of poor peasants is the backbone of the peasant association and the vanguard in overthrowing the feudal forces... Because the poor peasants are the most revolutionary, they have gained the leadership of the peasant association... This leadership of the poor peasants is very necessary... Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution."

　　Comrade Shen's understanding of the mass line in land reform, which is the poor peasant line, is not clear enough. Therefore, he initially believed that the heroic nature of the chairman of the peasant association was an abstract understanding, which could not stand the remarks of the middle peasants and became confused. At the same time, his views on the landlords are also biased, "The chairman of the village peasant association is a poor peasant, and his work is very active (especially in leading the mass movement); but his style is undemocratic, and he has gained more fruits in the struggle." This evaluation is very inappropriate. I believe that this landlord truly represents the revolutionary nature of the poor peasant class, and it also shows the inevitable action of the poor peasants who have been oppressed and exploited for thousands of years once they are emancipated today. His action is "completely in line with the actual development of history" (Chen Boda's words). He suffered deeply in the past, so what's wrong with showing off today and taking more spoils? The middle peasants commented that he "grabs everything, is selfish, and wants to get rich... The village head is fair," which is the statement of the middle peasant's position. If we compare the time of the poor peasants today with the middle peasants, then it is just like what the poor peasants in Quwo said, "On the surface, we have divided some things, but in reality, we are far behind the middle peasants." Who is grabbing everything, being selfish, and getting rich?

　　Of course, it is still a shortcoming that the chairman of the village peasant association wants to get more fruits for himself, but this shortcoming can be transformed under the conditions of mobilizing the poor and lower-middle peasants and giving full play to their democracy, and it must be transformed in this way. There are indeed bad habits and historical mistakes among the poor peasants (such as personnel from the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army and puppet organizations). This is mainly because they are forced by life and poisoned by the old society. If they gain power or participate in leadership under the leadership of the proletarian party, and the relations of production change, they will also become better. In fact, many poor peasants have become better today, and their leadership in the struggle is very firm and capable. Even if there are some bad behaviors and bad habits, they are only a few. As long as we use the telling of grievances to enlighten their original class consciousness, they will turn back.

　　These opinions may not be correct, and I hope Comrade Shen and other comrades will correct them.

　　要先和贫雇农商量
  　和申抒同志讨论群众路线
    高辛
    读了申抒同志“读‘有事和群众商量’给我的启发”（载九月九日本版）一文，我感觉到申同志的反省，一般的说来，他清理了去年群运经验的一部分，认识上是提高了一步，但是我认为还没有深入到问题的本质。
    根据申同志的结论是：“将问题交给群众去处理，让群众在集体的场合加以审慎的比较”，这种认识与精神是对的，但是交给怎么样的群众去处理和比较呢？这点我认为是问题的关键。
    目前我们的任务基本上为的解放农民。但是中贫农虽有翻身的一致要求，由于他们受剥削程度不一样，对土改的要求和态度也就不一样。申同志所举的村长（中农）与农会主席（贫农）对土地改革的态度，就表现了两个阶层的差别。“差不多”思想与和事老态度表现出中农的阶级本质；“不闹便罢，要闹就斩草除根。”表现出贫农的阶级本质。这种中贫农的共同点与矛盾点，我们必须弄清楚。他们既存在这样不同要求和态度，在处理问题上就会产生不同的看法和意见。在今天的农村中，由于土改还不彻底，整个贫农阶层还没有完全发动。如果不分别中贫农对革命的不同态度，不弄清贫农是土改的基本动力，不把贫农的要求当作土改的基本方向，不划清中贫农两个不同阶层，而笼统地交给群众，那末在贫农未被很好发动起来的地区和村庄，中农会占优势的，中农的态度会被认为土改的基本方向，“农主坏，村长好”就是明证。寿张县“在多数表决之下（中农人数多），果实按富农路线分配”，这样必然会影响和阻碍深入与贯澈土地改革，因此领导群运者必须明确与站在农民中的贫农立场，要为贫农撑腰，要把问题先交贫农去处理和比较，“一切工作通过贫农”，这才是群众路线。这样指导思想明确与肯定起来，那怕群运中如何复杂的问题不断到来，就不会摇摆不定和糊涂起来。
    由于中贫农有它共同的翻身要求，困此必须团结中农，但“贫农是骨，中农是肉”，必须以贫农为骨干，以贫农的意见为中心，再去得到中农的同意与同情，团结大多数。只有这条贫农路线才是民主革命彻底胜利的保证，毛主席早在大革命时代就已指出：“这个贫农大群众，乃农民协会的中坚，打倒封建势力的先锋……贫农因为最革命，所以他们取得农会的领导权……这个贫农领导，是非常之需要的……没有贫农便没有革命”。
    申同志对于土改中的群众路线就是贫农路线的认识不够明确，因此在开始认为农会主席好汉是种抽象的认识，经不起中农一说，说得糊涂起来了。同时他对农主的看法也有偏向，“该村农会主席是贫农，工作很积极（尤其在领导群运方面更如此）；但作风不民主，且在斗争中多得了果实”，这种评价很不妥当的。我认为这个农主真真代表了贫农阶层的革命本色，也正说明贫农受了几千年的压迫剥削，今天一旦翻身的必然行动，他的行动是“完全合乎历史发展的实际”（陈伯达语），他过去受的痛苦很深，今天逞威风，多拿战利品有啥不该呢？中农评论他“什么事都是一把抓，自私自利，想发财……村长那人倒公正”，这是中农立场的说法，如果我们把贫农今天的时光同中农来比一比，那末正象曲沃贫农所说“表面上我们分了些东西，实际上比中农差得很远”，究竟谁一把抓、自私自利、发财呢？
    当然，那个村农会主席要个人多得果实，仍是个缺点，但这个缺点是在发动贫雇，发挥了贫雇的民主条件下，可以改造的，而且也必须以此来改造的，贫农中间不是没有不良习惯和历史上做过错误的地方（如蒋伪军伪组织人员），这主要是为生活所迫和旧社会毒害他们的，如果他们在无产阶级政党领导下得到权力或参加领导，生产关系起了变化，他们也会变好自己的，事实上，今天已有许多贫农变好了，而且领导斗争很坚决、很能干，即或，有些不好的表现与坏习气，也只是少数，只要用诉苦来启发他们原来的阶级觉悟，会回过头来的。
    这些意见未必正确，希望申同志和别的同志们指正。
