Postal Workers in Feicheng and Other Counties
　　Penetrate Enemy-Occupied Areas and Enemy Strongholds to Post Newspapers and Distribute Leaflets
　　Launching a Psychological Offensive Against the Enemy
　　[Our Newspaper News] After the Liu-Deng army crossed the river, the Jiluyu First Military Region Post Office, in order to cooperate with the army's counter-offensive and resolutely implement the Party Committee's distribution instructions of "facing the enemy-occupied areas," launched a psychological offensive against the enemy, bravely penetrating enemy-occupied areas and enemy strongholds to post newspapers and distribute propaganda, encouraging the people and disintegrating the enemy army. The Feicheng Post Office collected old newspapers from various agencies and posted them in the city. Zhang Jianju of the Third Station cooperated with the armed work team to penetrate the Shicheng enemy stronghold in the Seventh District, posting newspapers and propaganda all over the main roads and streets of the village, and packaging newspapers and propaganda in envelopes, using pseudo-officials to send them to the enemy, ensuring that wherever the enemy went, our newspapers and leaflets followed. From July 26 to August 14, a total of 1151 copies of newspapers and propaganda were posted and distributed in half a month, with 11 new subscribers, 100 portraits of leaders sold, and 12 books, achieving the greatest results. People's heroes such as Zhang Jianju, Wang Ziming, and Zhai Lucun emerged. During the enemy's southward invasion, when the Wenhe River was blockaded on both sides, Comrades Wu Shengfu, Li Guozhen, and Wu Shaowu of the Ningyang Bureau penetrated enemy-occupied villages to post 130 copies of newspapers, etc. They are now preparing to further penetrate the enemy to disintegrate them and launch an offensive. Distributors Li Qizhen and Hu Zhaozhen of the Pingyin Bureau went to each village to write blackboards, spreading news of victory. Within more than ten days of enemy occupation of Pingyin, more than 100 copies of various newspapers and propaganda were posted. This political offensive of attacking the enemy's mind and disintegrating the enemy army to cooperate with the counter-offensive is a new direction for postal distribution work in the entire border area and guerrilla area, and should be vigorously developed. The following points of experience are listed for study: 1. Post newspapers and propaganda in conspicuous places where the enemy often goes. In order to attract the enemy's attention, specially highlight the four sides of the leaflets or the titles of the newspapers with red or green colored pens, or write a small note of attention and paste it on the headline. 2. In places where the enemy rarely goes, newspapers and propaganda can be distributed and posted, and combined with oral propaganda to maximize the role of newspapers and propaganda. 3. Packaging newspapers and propaganda in envelopes and using pseudo-officials to send them to the enemy is also the best way. 4. Because there are few newspapers in the guerrilla area, the post office staying in the village should frequently and timely broadcast the news of victory on the blackboard newspaper. 5. When the propaganda is small, paste it outside the newspaper or on the headline, which is both eye-catching and easy to post.

　　肥城等县邮工
  　深入敌占区敌据点张贴报纸散发传单
  　对敌展开攻心战
    【本报讯】刘邓大军渡河后，冀鲁豫一分区邮局为配合大军反攻，和坚决执行党委“面向敌占区”的发行指示，对敌展开攻心战，勇敢深入敌占区敌据点张贴报纸散发宣传品，开展发行工作，鼓舞人民，瓦解敌军。肥城邮局收集各机关旧报纸到城内张贴，三站张建举配合武工队深入七区石横敌据点，将报纸宣传品贴满全村各要路街巷，并将报纸宣传品用信封装好，利用伪属送到敌人手里，做到敌人到那里，我们的报纸传单便跟到那里。从七月二十六日至八月十四日，半月共张贴散发报纸宣传品一一五一份，发展订户一一个，售领袖像一百张、书十二本，成绩最大。出现了张建举、王子明、翟鲁村等人民功臣。宁阳局吴圣甫、李国振、吴绍五三同志于此次敌人南犯，封锁汶河两岸时，即深入敌占区村庄张贴报纸等一三○份。现正准备二次深入瓦解敌人，开展攻势。平阴局发行员李其振、扈兆祯同志走一村写一村黑板报，传播胜利消息。敌占平阴十余天内即张贴各种报纸宣传品一百余份。此一对敌攻心战，瓦解敌军配合反攻的政治攻势，实为全边区游击区内邮政发行工作的新方向，应大力开展。几点经验列下提供学习：一、在敌人常来往地方将报纸宣传品贴到显眼之处，为了使敌人注意，并将传单四边或报纸的标题用红或绿色之色笔特别显标，或另写注意小条贴在报头上。二、在敌少到之地方，报纸宣传品可用散发与张贴等办法，并结合口头宣传，使报纸宣传品发挥更大作用。三、用信封装好报纸宣传品，利用伪属给敌人送，也是最好办法。四、游击区因为报纸少，邮局住在村要经常及时的在黑板报上广播胜利消息。五、宣传品较小时，就贴在报纸外边或报头上，既引人注意又便于张贴。
