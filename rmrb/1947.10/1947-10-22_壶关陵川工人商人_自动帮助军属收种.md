　　Huguan and Lingchuan Workers and Merchants
  　Automatically Help Military Families with Harvesting and Planting
    [Report from Huguan] The class consciousness of the industrial and commercial people in Chengguan has been unprecedentedly elevated. In order to quickly eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, they automatically proposed to help military families with the autumn harvest. For example, Song Songde said, "Now the crops are ripe, and the soldiers at the front are shedding blood and sweat to protect us. We business people in the rear are living relatively comfortably and should help military families with the autumn harvest." When the cadres heard this, they convened a general meeting of all industrial and commercial people and proposed: "We have squeezed out the feudal lords and turned ourselves around. Our turnaround benefits all rely on the army protecting us at the front. How should we help the families of soldiers?" Everyone engaged in a heated discussion. On the spot, 108 people automatically signed up and proposed: "Don't eat the military families' food, work actively, and don't be picky." They formed a support-the-military team, with three sub-teams. The original plan was for the three teams to take turns helping to complete 100 mu of autumn harvest, but due to rain delays, the cadres, fearing that the crops would be damaged by wind and rain, called on the industrial and commercial people to mobilize in large numbers for a surprise harvest. The task was completed in one day, and a competition was launched. Everyone was very enthusiastic. On October 8th alone, 87 people helped 35 military and martyrs' families harvest a total of 59 mu of grain, carry 45.4 mu of grain, strip 23 mu of corn, carry 12 mu of corn, and other tasks such as cutting beans, millet, millet stalks, and carrying baskets, totaling 107 workdays. Each person averaged six *xiangs* of work, with great results. The masses reflected: "The Communist Party's leadership is good. In the past, merchants would not have done this. If I had to hire people for this autumn harvest, I would have to clean up on rainy days. You finished it in one day!" (Du Cai, Rong Zu, Xue Yu)
    [Report from Lingchuan] On the 6th of this month, when the Chamber of Commerce held a meeting to discuss how to cooperate with the war effort, Comrade Zhang Liansong of the District Cooperative Association said: "The militiamen and laborers are participating in the war to fight Old Chiang. Merchants should help with the autumn harvest and autumn planting in the rear. On the one hand, they can train merchants in labor and serve the masses. On the other hand, they can make the relationship between merchants and the people closer. This is equivalent to our merchants participating in the war." His speech was met with enthusiastic response from all the merchants. Some merchants locked their doors and mobilized completely. The hotel and the District Cooperative Association, led by managers Zhang and Ma, provided 26 laborers in one day. The District Office, led by Branch Secretary Yue, mobilized completely, stopped office work, and all participated in cutting grain and stripping corn for the masses. Comrade Yue also personally took the lead in pulling grain with manpower, freeing up livestock for autumn plowing. In three days, the whole town harvested 1,804 mu of grain, stripped 1,120 mu of corn, carried 240 mu of grain, plowed 130 mu of land, and pulled 220 mu of beans. Three days of labor totaled 3,260 people, including 304 merchants. Now all the grain in Pingcheng Town has been harvested, and half of the corn has been stripped. The night after the grain was harvested, a strong wind came up. The masses said, "If we hadn't listened to Comrade Yue, we would have lost more than 54 *shi* based on three *sheng* per mu." An old lady on the street said: "The democratic government is really good now, and the merchants under its leadership are also different. If it weren't for their help, we wouldn't be able to finish the harvest by now." (Chun Rong)
