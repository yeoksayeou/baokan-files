Yuebei First Special District Calls for Evaluating the Good and Learning Well
　　Summarizing the Autumn Harvest and Inspecting Autumn Planting
　　[Our newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 26th] The Yuebei First Special Administrative Office, in order to mobilize the broad masses to summarize the autumn harvest and inspect autumn planting, specially called on governments at all levels on the 19th to urgently do two things: First, organize production inspection groups at the district or joint-village level, from top to bottom, or villages and districts to inspect each other, evaluate the good, evaluate the bad, and learn from the good, turning the autumn planting work into a heated mass movement. In terms of inspection methods and content, the Third District of Qinyuan has created experience: going to the fields, to mutual aid teams, conducting practical, material inspections of experience, achievements, organizational leadership, etc., combined with autumn planting and seed selection work, and then conducting evaluations of the good. Second, "In spring, compare manure piles; in autumn, compare grain piles." After the autumn harvest, with the village or mutual aid team as a unit, convene grain exhibitions to summarize the work of the entire village. Where possible, districts can also call on better villages to start summarizing from household to household,展开 a mass summary work of "comparing goods to goods" from household to village. Therefore, in inspecting the autumn harvest, attention must be paid to the collection of exhibits and full preparation of experience. It was also pointed out that the above two tasks are the foundation for carrying out winter production, and governments at all levels should earnestly organize and lead them.

　　岳北一专号召评好学好
  　总结秋收检查秋耕
    【本报太岳二十六日电】岳北一专署，为发动广大群众来总结秋收与检查秋耕，特于十九日号召各级政府急须做两件工作：一、组织区或联村生产检查团，由上而下，或村与村区与区互相检查，评好，评坏，学好，把秋耕工作闹成热火朝天的大运动。在检查的方法与内容上，沁源三区已创造了经验：到地里，互助组里，实际实物检查经验、成绩、组织领导等方面，结合进行秋耕选种等工作，然后进行评好。二、“春天比粪堆，秋天比谷堆”，在秋后以村或互助组为单位，召开禾谷展览会，总结全村工作，在可能条件下，区也可号召较好的村子从按户总结做起，展开由户到村的“货比货”的群众性说好记好评好的总结工作。因此，在检查秋收中，必须注意展览品的搜集及充分的经验准备。并指出以上两件工作是开展冬季生产的基础，各级政府应认真的进行组织领导。
