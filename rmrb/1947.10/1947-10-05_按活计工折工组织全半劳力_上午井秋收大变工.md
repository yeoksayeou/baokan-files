　　Organize Full and Semi Labor Force by Work-Point-Based Labor Exchange
  　The Great Autumn Harvest Labor Exchange in Shangwujing Village
    [Reported by our newspaper from Pingshun] After summarizing the experiences of cutting artemisia and planting wheat, Shangwujing Village in the First District launched the autumn harvest and autumn plowing campaign, combined with the rectification of mutual aid. After three days of discussion, the following measures were decided: the whole village implemented a large-scale labor exchange between men and women, harvesting one plot, then plowing another, and sowing immediately after plowing (catch cropping). Generally, men first harvest the distant plots and have the livestock carry the harvest back, while women harvest the nearby plots, and men carry it back at night. Livestock are then used to plow and till the land to plant catch cropping wheat. If there is still time, fertilizer is delivered. Women cut millet at night and take time during the day to thresh. The work-point method in the whole village is as follows: calculate work-points based on the work done. For example, in Li Buqi's team, a woman can earn two portions which translates to four points, apart from the miscellaneous household chores each day, stripping corn cobs earns five portions which translates to ten points. In this way, all full and semi-labor force men and women can participate in the labor exchange. Secondly, a village-wide shock team will be organized; if one group cannot finish, a shock team will assist. At the same time, special care should be taken for the families of soldiers and cadres going south during the harvest and plowing. According to calculations, the whole village has 32 households of soldiers' families and 3 households of cadres' families, requiring a total of more than 700 workdays. Each laborer needs to help an average of four workdays to ensure the work is done well. In order to implement this harvest and plowing plan, cadres are assigned to lead different groups, and inspectors are selected from the masses to conduct mass inspections. After the harvest and plowing are completed, mass evaluations, record-keeping, and commendations will be carried out. Now the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres is very high. (Gen Ke, Yu Xian)

　　按活计工折工组织全半劳力
  　上午井秋收大变工
    【本报平顺讯】一区上午井村在总结割蒿种麦基础上，展开了秋收秋耕运动，结合整顿互助。先后三天时间，讨论出如下办法：全村实行男女大变工，黄一块，割一块，割一块，犁一块，随犁随种（赶茬），一般的是男人先割远处，叫牲口驮，女人割近处，男人黑夜往回扛，抽出牲口去犁地翻地种改茬麦。再有时间就是送肥，妇女黑夜切谷，白天抽时间打场。全村折工办法是：按活计工、折工。如李不乞组，妇女一天除了杂生活顶两晌折四分，撇玉茭一天顶五晌折十分。这样对于男女全半劳力就都能参加到变工里边去。其次是组织全村性的突击组，那组弄不完就进行突击，同时在收耕中要特别照顾抗属和南下干属。根据计算，全村三十二户抗属，三户干属，共需用工七百多个，每个劳力平均需帮工四个，保证作好。为了贯彻这一收耕计划，干部都分工分组来领导，并从群众中选出检查员，进行群众性的检查。收耕毕就进行群众性评功记功立功，现在群众干部情绪很高。（根科、玉贤）
