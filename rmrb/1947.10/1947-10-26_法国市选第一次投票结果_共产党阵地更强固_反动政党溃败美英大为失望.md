　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Comprehensive reports indicate that the first round of voting in the French national city and village new council elections on the 19th shows that the French Communist Party's strong position is indestructible. The Socialist Party, which styles itself as centrist but in reality carries out the will of the reactionaries, and especially the Popular Republican Movement, have been abandoned by the French reactionary forces. The majority of right-wing votes went to de Gaulle's newly established "Union." The French Communist Party's statement on the evening of the 20th pointed out: "Despite all the attacks against the Communist Party, and despite the unfair election law, the municipal elections on the 19th still showed that the Communist Party has been strengthened. It obtained more than 30 percent of the vote in various centers of decisive significance throughout the country, and maintained its position in the Seine province." On the eve of this municipal election, the French reactionaries, led by de Gaulle and under the instruction and practical assistance of American imperialists, gathered all the scum and dregs who were anti-communist and anti-people into the so-called "French People's Union," a reactionary organization, and formed a joint anti-communist electoral front with the Radical Party, the Popular Republican Movement, the right-wing Socialist Party, the fascist Republican Liberty Party, and other motley small parties, attempting to seize the Communist Party's votes and plunge France back into the bloodbath of foreign imperialism and domestic reactionary forces. However, the voting results showed that the "achievements" obtained by de Gaulle's "Union" only changed the face of the votes of all other right-wing reactionaries. The firm part of the French people, their belief in upholding democracy, was never deceived or confused by the rhetoric of the de Gaulle clique. Even the reactionary French Catholic newspapers that oppose him could not help but admit: "De Gaulle's party's victory represents a redistribution of anti-communist forces, not the failure of the Communist Party." (AFP dispatch on the 21st) "France Libre" said on the 20th: "The Socialist Party seems to have suffered a new setback, the Communist Party suffered a very slight setback in some parts, but the Popular Republican Movement was unexpectedly defeated." The reaction from Wall Street imperialism was clearly one of great disappointment. According to an AFP dispatch on the 20th: "According to most American sources, they believe that de Gaulle's group will at most get 20 percent of the vote. American observers insist that the success of the de Gaulle movement is not at the expense of the Communist Party, but due to the frustration of the Socialist Party, especially at the expense of the Popular Republican Movement." The British reaction also showed a lack of confidence in de Gaulle. An AFP dispatch on the 21st stated: "Some London figures asserted that the Popular Republican Movement, the loser today, was the biggest winner in the legislative elections a year ago. The same thing may happen to the French People's Union." According to the new French election law of September 5, only one vote is held in areas with more than 9,000 people, while towns with less than 9,000 people require two votes. Therefore, the final results of this French municipal election will only be revealed after the second vote on the 26th. The French Communist Party's statement on the evening of the 20th called on all workers and democrats to unite and strive for the second vote to defeat the de Gaulle Union in the election.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: TASS Paris dispatch: The French Communist Party's organ, "L'Humanité," published a statistical table on the 23rd, showing that the number of votes in favor of the Communist Party has gradually increased in the past two years, while the influence of the reactionary ringleader de Gaulle has declined. On October 24, 1945, the Communist Party won a little over 26 percent of the vote; on November 10, 1946, 28 percent; on November 24, 1946, 29.3 percent; and on October 19, 1947, 30.65 percent (according to the latest results). Another statistical table shows the decline in de Gaulle's influence. The newspaper cited three by-elections in which the number of French people in favor of de Gaulle was: October 21, 1945 - 66.5 percent; May 5, 1946 - 53 percent; October 13, 1946 - 46.9 percent; and in the municipal elections on October 19, 1947 - 38.4 percent.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Comprehensive reports indicate that American imperialism has placed a huge bet on this French municipal election and is openly interfering in an attempt to support the victory of de Gaulle, the new seller of the French people, in order to turn France into an appendage of the United States and its forward base for further expansion in Western Europe. A United Press dispatch on the 18th stated: "Washington officials are closely watching the French municipal elections on the 19th to see if the dollar can counter the Communist Party." It also stated: "The United States, led by President Truman, has done its best to provide good news to French non-Communist voters on the eve of the election. In the past few days, the United States has allocated $247 million in credit loans to France." An AFP dispatch on the 17th stated: "Before the municipal elections, the United States announced several loans and 'aid' to France, totaling $450 million to $550 million." In the eyes of the United States, if de Gaulle's party members, who are openly campaigning with a program of abolishing the new constitution and completely relying on the United States, can win, then the United States' policy toward France and its plan to put "pre-war politicians" in power in France can be realized. Therefore, it is vigorously touting the "international significance" of this municipal election. On the eve of the election, American imperialism also sent Republican Bridge, chairman of the US Senate Appropriations Committee, to lead a delegation to France to personally intervene. According to a recent exposure by the French Volunteers' newspaper, after Bridge arrived in France, he held talks with Ramadier, Bidault, and Schuman, and afterwards declared: "I (Bridge claimed) told the French authorities that we firmly hope that the French government will not be controlled by the Communist Party, and we will get the guarantee that with reasonable cooperation, it must be possible to prevent the Communist Party from winning."

　　法国市选第一次投票结果
  　共产党阵地更强固
    反动政党溃败美英大为失望
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合报导：十九日法国全国城市村镇新议会选举的第一次投票结果，显示法国共产党的坚强阵地不可摧毁。以中间派自命实则执行反动派意志的社会党，尤其是人民共和党，则遭到法国反动势力的撇弃，大部右派的选票投向戴高乐新建的“联盟”。法共二十日晚所发表的声明指出：“虽然有反对共产党的一切攻击，虽然选举法不公平，然而在十九日的市选中，仍然表现出共产党增强了，它在全国有决定意义的各中心，获得了百分之三十以上的选票，并在塞纳省保持其地位”，此次市选前夕，法国反动派以戴高乐为首在美国帝国主义者授意并实际帮助下，将一切反共反人民的渣滓和败类，纠合在所谓“法国人民联盟”的反动组织内，与急进党、人民共和党、右派社会党、法西斯共和自由党及其他五颜六色的小党派结成反共的联合选举阵线，企图夺取共产党的选票，使法兰西重陷于外国帝国主义与国内反动势力的血泊中。但是投票结果，戴高乐“联盟”所获得的“成就”，只是将一切其他右派反动派的票数改头换面而已，法国人民的坚定部分，其拥护民主的信念绝未为戴高乐辈的花言巧语所欺骗迷惑，并且连反对他的反动的法国天主教报纸也不能不承认：“戴高乐党的胜利，代表反共力量的重新分配，而不是共产党的失败。”（法新社二十一日电）“法兰西自由报”二十日称：“社会党似乎遭受了一个新的挫折，共产党在某些部分遭到极微的挫折，但人民共和党却出乎任何人意外地溃败了。”华尔街帝国主义方面的反应显然是老大的失望。据法新社二十日电称：“依照大多数美方人士估计，他们都认为戴高乐集团至多不过获得选票的百分之二十。美观察家们力称，戴高乐运动之成为胜利者，并不是以共产党为牺牲的代价，而是由于社会党的挫败，特别是以人民共和党为牺牲的代价。”英国的反应，同样表现为对戴高乐缺乏信心。法新社二十一日电称：“若干伦敦人士断言，今日失败者的人民共和党，在一年前却是立法选举的最大胜利者。同样的事情可能发生于法国人民联盟身上。”按照九月五日法国新选举法，凡有九千人以上的地区只作一次投票，而九千人以下的乡镇则需要投票两次，因此，法国此次市选的最后结果，尚待二十六日的第二次投票以后始得揭晓，法共二十日晚的声明中呼吁一切工人及民主人士联合起来，争取第二次投票，在选举中击退戴高乐联盟。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法共机关报人道报二十三日发表统计表，显示在过去两年内赞成共产党的票数逐渐增长，而反动派头子戴高乐的影响则日益下降。一九四五年十月二十四日，共产党获得选票的百分之二十六强，一九四六年十一月十日，百分之二十八；一九四六年十一月二十四日，百分之二十九点三；而在一九四七年十月十九日，百分之三十点六五（根据最近的结果）；另一统计表显示戴高乐影响的衰减。该报举出三次复选中赞成戴高乐的法国人数：一九四五年十月二十一日——百分之六十六点五；一九四六年五月五日——百分之五十三；一九四六年十月十三日——百分之四十六点九；而在一九四七年十月十九日市选中——百分之三十八点四。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合报导：美帝国主义对法国这次市选会下极大赌注，并作露骨的干与，企图扶植法国人民的新出卖者戴高乐获胜，以便沦法国为美国的附庸及其在西欧进一步扩张的前进基地。合众社十八日电曾谓：“华府官方密切注意十九日的法国市选，以视美元是否能对抗共产党。”并称：“美国以杜鲁门总统为首于选举前夕，曾尽力以良好消息供给法国之非共产党选民。过去数日美国曾以信用贷款拨交法国者，数达两亿四千七百万美元。法新社十七日电则称：“市选前美公布数项对法贷款与‘援助’，数达四亿五千万至五亿五千万美元。”在美国看来，公开以废除新宪法及完全依附美国的纲领竞选的戴高乐党徒如能获胜，则美国对法政策及使法国“战前政治家”上台执政的计划，即可实现，因此亟力吹嘘此次市选之“国际意义”；美帝国主义并于选举前夕派遣美参院拨款委员会主席共和党人勃里奇率代表团抵法亲临干与。据法国义勇军报日前揭露，勃氏抵法后即与拉马第、比道尔及舒曼会谈，事后并宣称：“我（勃氏自称）曾告诉法国当局，我们坚决希望法国政府不为共产党所控制，我们会得到保证，借助于合理的合作，阻止共产党赢得胜利，一定是可能的。”
