    滨海自四月下旬至五月底，开展四十天的军政攻势，一方面表现出党委、军分区坚定英勇的决心，全心全意为人民服务；另一方面，也证明着军政攻势显示出群众力量。据六月十八日记者沙洪报导：“滨海军分区、滨南指挥部顷发表综合公报称：为配合华东野战军在泰安及孟良崮的两次歼灭战役，我滨南各种地方武装，基干兵团和各种游击队广泛出击，对临青路南‘还乡团’武装进行扫荡，四十天来已获重大战绩。自四月下旬至五月初，我基干兵团某某等部分三路插入滨南地区，先后收复沭河两岸敌据点八里巷、华埠、马站、三井村等处及欢（墩埠）沙（河）线以南之朱家汪、麻庄湖。并联系泰安大捷扩大宣传，当地军民莫不振奋！‘还乡团’妖气大挫，望风而逃，此为滨南攻势作战的第一阶段。自五月初至中旬，我军民继续扩大攻势，分别向陇海路沿线及临（沂）郯（城）路两侧进击，先后收复桃林、竹墩、石榴树、驼峰、曹埠等地，扫清马陵山东麓及陇海路北侧地区之蒋伪，并西越沂河，在庄坞、涌泉地区击溃郯城敌五十七师一个营，毙俘百人，此为第二阶段。自五月中旬至月底，为主动配合孟良崮大战，我东海、郯城军民，积极向陇海线南侧及郯城西南地区进展，攻克蒲汪据点，同时临沭军民配合某部，西迫李家庄敌据点，不断破袭临郯路，向东侧进逼欢墩埠，克复破石桥、庄主堂等地，并于敌二十八师沿临青路北调途中，以游击爆炸战步步阻击，西盘一战，毙敌数十名，此为第三阶段。自七月初旬以来，我各地武装，纷纷开赴边缘，掩护群众突击夏收，打击蒋伪抢麦活动，在沭河西岸郯城以北三十余里之柳沟一带围歼‘还乡团’百余，击溃蒋军一个营。我各县军民并以孟良崮大捷及保卫麦收为中心，对蒋伪展开猛烈的政治攻势，使‘还乡团’、伪自卫队大量瓦解。”沙洪另电报导政治攻势成绩：“滨海六月十四日讯：在麦收前，我滨南临沭、东海、郯城三县恢复区军民，配合泰安、孟良崮大捷及临青路南的军事扫荡，猛烈展开五月政治攻势。据初步统计，已争取‘还乡团’与伪自卫队员四三八三人回家自新，并带来枪支一部；四散逃亡者亦有一千二百三十余名；四月下旬蒋军进攻滨南期间，被骗逃往蒋占区之群众，已大部回家收麦，现恢复区社会秩序日益转趋安定繁荣。这一军政攻势，通过保卫麦收夏季作战，继续扩展，例如竹庭政治攻势在六月初一周间，瓦解‘还乡团’二百五十人，八百户回家收麦，其主要方式是‘武政结合’，‘先打后拉’；麦收前竹庭县以保卫麦收，反倒算，反抓丁为中心，展开政治攻势突击周；三阳区地方武装制成大批漫画传单，上写‘麦子黄又黄，恶霸地主莫胡想，你若割割群众麦，保管后路不永长’，以警告复辟地主。宋庄一带‘地主还乡团’都反映：‘八路可不说虚言，还是老实些好。’镇南区地方武装实行‘武政结合’，一面进至沙河逮捕‘还乡团’十七名，一面在各村召开歼蒋七十四师祝捷大会，并写了一百五十余封信给复辟地主，使东再金等三十余复辟地主不敢倒果实；在李瓦窑沟恶霸伪保长王举盛伏法影响下，三十余村自动停止资敌；三阳区多方揭发蒋政罪行，民主政府发动反抓丁动员会，号召与组织蒋占区青壮年拒绝参加伪“自卫团”。对伪政权‘还乡团’用红黑点实行善恶登记，定期公布善恶榜。城关等区群众，用“捎口信”办法，宣传解放军政策，被骗群众相继回家收麦者，据不完全统计，已有六百九十四户；另瓦解‘还乡团’二百五十六人外，俘蒋军蒋特六十七名。”
From late April to the end of May, the Coastal Region launched a forty-day military-political offensive, demonstrating the firm and heroic determination of the Party Committee and military sub-district to serve the people wholeheartedly. On the other hand, it also proved that the military-political offensive demonstrated the strength of the masses. According to a report by journalist Sha Hong on June 18th: "The Binhai Military Sub-district and the Binan Headquarters have just issued a comprehensive communiqué stating: To coordinate with the East China Field Army's two annihilation battles in Tai'an and Menglianggu, various local armed forces, basic corps, and guerrilla teams in Binan launched extensive attacks to wipe out the "Homecoming Corps" armed forces south of the Linqing Road, achieving significant victories over the past forty days. From late April to early May, parts of our basic corps, such as XX, inserted themselves into the Binan area in three routes, successively recovering enemy strongholds on both sides of the Shu River, such as Bali Lane, Huabu, Mazhan, Sanjing Village, and Zhujiawang and Mazhuang Lake south of the Huan (Dunbu) Sha (River) line. In conjunction with the great victory of Tai'an, propaganda was expanded, and the local military and civilians were all invigorated! The arrogance of the "Homecoming Corps" was greatly reduced, and they fled at the mere sight of our forces. This was the first stage of the Binan offensive operation. From early to mid-May, our military and civilians continued to expand the offensive, advancing along the Longhai Railway and on both sides of the Lin (Yi) Tan (Cheng) Road, successively recovering Taolin, Zhudun, Shiliu Tree, Tuofeng, Caobu and other places, clearing the Chiang Kai-shek's puppet forces in the eastern foothills of the Maling Mountains and the area north of the Longhai Railway, and crossing the Yi River to the west, defeating a battalion of the enemy's 57th Division in Tancheng in the Zhuangwu and Yongquan areas, killing and capturing hundreds of people. This was the second stage. From mid-May to the end of the month, in order to actively cooperate with the Menglianggu campaign, the military and civilians of Donghai and Tancheng actively advanced to the south side of the Longhai Line and the southwest area of Tancheng, capturing the Puwang stronghold. At the same time, the military and civilians of Linshu, in cooperation with a certain unit, forced the enemy stronghold of Lijiazhuang in the west, constantly disrupting the Lintan Road, and pressing towards Huandunbu on the east side, recovering Poshitiao and Zhuangzhutang and other places. During the enemy's 28th Division's northward march along the Linqing Road, they used guerrilla explosive warfare to block them step by step. In the Battle of Xipan, dozens of enemy soldiers were killed. This was the third stage. Since the beginning of July, our armed forces in various places have rushed to the edges of the restored areas to cover the masses in rushing to harvest summer crops and to combat Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops' activities of robbing wheat. They encircled and annihilated more than 100 "Homecoming Corps" members in Liugou, more than 30 miles north of Tancheng on the west bank of the Shu River, and defeated a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's army. The military and civilians of our counties also launched a fierce political offensive against Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops with the great victory of Menglianggu and the protection of the wheat harvest as the center, causing a large number of "Homecoming Corps" and puppet self-defense forces to disintegrate." Sha Hong also reported by telegram on the achievements of the political offensive: "Binhai, June 14th: Before the wheat harvest, the military and civilians of the restored areas of the three counties of Linshu, Donghai, and Tancheng in Binan, in coordination with the great victories of Tai'an and Menglianggu and the military sweeps south of Linqing Road, launched a fierce May political offensive. According to preliminary statistics, 4,383 members of the 'Homecoming Corps' and puppet self-defense members have been won over to return home and start anew, and have brought back some firearms; more than 1,230 people have fled in all directions; and most of the masses who were deceived into fleeing to the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied areas during the Chiang Kai-shek army's offensive against Binan in late April have returned home to harvest wheat, and the social order in the restored areas is becoming increasingly stable and prosperous. This military-political offensive has continued to expand through the summer wheat harvest operation. For example, the Zhuting political offensive disintegrated 250 members of the 'Homecoming Corps' and 800 households returned home to harvest wheat in the first week of June. Its main method is 'military-political combination' and 'strike first, then win over'; before the wheat harvest, Zhuting County launched a political offensive blitz week with the protection of the wheat harvest, anti-liquidation, and anti-conscription as the center; the local armed forces in the Sanyang District produced a large number of cartoon leaflets, which read 'The wheat is yellow and yellow, the evil landlords must not think wildly, if you cut the wheat of the masses, you will be guaranteed to have no way out', to warn the restored landlords. The 'Landlord Homecoming Corps' in Songzhuang and other areas reflected: 'The Eighth Route Army doesn't make empty promises, it's better to be honest.' The local armed forces in Zhennan District implemented a 'military-political combination', on the one hand advancing to the Shahe River to arrest 17 members of the 'Homecoming Corps', and on the other hand holding victory celebration meetings in various villages to celebrate the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division, and writing more than 150 letters to the restored landlords, so that more than 30 restored landlords such as Dong Zaijin did not dare to take back the fruits of the people; under the influence of the execution of the evil bully Wang Jusheng, the puppet chief of Liwa Yao ditch, more than 30 villages automatically stopped providing resources to the enemy; the Sanyang District exposed the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's government in many ways, and the democratic government launched an anti-conscription mobilization meeting, calling on and organizing young people in Chiang Kai-shek-occupied areas to refuse to participate in the puppet 'self-defense corps'. The 'Homecoming Corps' of the puppet regime used red and black dots to register good and evil deeds, and regularly published good and evil lists. The masses in Chengguan and other districts used the 'word of mouth' method to publicize the policies of the Liberation Army. According to incomplete statistics, 694 households who had been deceived have returned home to harvest wheat; in addition, 256 members of the 'Homecoming Corps' have been disintegrated, and 67 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and special agents have been captured."

    滨海区在麦季开始公布对“还乡团”麦地处理办法。据记者沙洪报导：时至麦收前夕，各地又结合复仇运动，普遍登记“还乡团”及逃亡户的麦田，宣布处理办法（无抢劫行为者代收代存，首要分子者没收，其他根据其行为及是否回家悔过，由群众讨论公决），于是尚未回家的“还乡团”与伪自卫队家属十分着急，有的当场保证去叫回亲人；东海县罗庄之逃亡户，经我这一措施后，三日内即回来二十三个人；此外，对于曾经带枪投敌或报告隐藏物资与公家者，单纯宣传宽大号召其回家自新，不会发生效力，反而引起他们疑惧，临沭县根据他们之畏罪心理，提出“立功赎罪”，为他们指点出路，岌山等区不数日便有十二人携枪来归，东海重要“还乡团”分子×××并送来机枪一挺，钢枪数支。例如郯城独立团歼灭“还乡团”为群众除害是镇压首要凶犯之一范例。“郯城七月十四日讯：沭河区“还乡团”头子蔺德纯在敌伪时期当伪乡长数年，蒋贼侵占郯城后又任伪职，组织“还乡团”，向群众倒果实说：“少我一个小皮钱也不行！”数月来光银洋就敲诈了七百余元，蔺××家被逼去二石五斗秫秫，一石麦子；蔺××七亩地被敲去五亩，宁××的老婆被逼上吊，盐店，麦圩子被逼买机关枪。在麦前麦后一个多月中他请蒋军来“扫荡”五次，伪县长奖他一箱子弹、四支枪，附近青壮年扛着锄头日夜蹲在马陵山上说：“有蔺德纯在河东，咱就不能得安！钱叫他敲干净不要紧，人也要弄净啦！”县独立团为了解除群众痛苦，经十数日的侦察布置，于七月五日配合武工队，在××庄包围蔺德纯部，仅一个多钟头就全部解决，把蔺德纯和两个通讯员烧死在“三寡妇”家里，俘虏敌十八名，毙伤八名，缴枪三十支，子弹二千余发，手榴弹七枚，我无一伤亡。战斗中，不少老百姓向“三寡妇”的住院跑去，告诉战士：“蔺德纯就在那个院里，快扔炸弹！”。据记者沙洪报导，争取“还乡团”的动摇分子，孤立坏蛋，是结合镇压，展开政治攻势的主要方式。六月十四日讯：此次政治攻势中，各县均有新的创造，攻势开始时，在恢复区中抓紧军事胜利，普遍进行时事宣传，当孟良崮捷报传来后，各地先后以区乡为单位，召开群众大会庆祝胜利，动员保卫麦收，东海白河区并组织两个流动宣传队，分赴边沿、游击区及内地市集进行化装宣传。宣传队中有讲解时事的，有管理宣传棚解释时事漫画的，有唱武老二的，队前以三四套锣鼓及大幅布联为前导，上书“报告前线大喜事”，“战局快转变”，声势浩大，兴奋人心。在这样群众性的大会与集市上，民主政府明确宣布对敌伪人员及一般逃亡户的政策，指出他们的生死之路，号召他们开展择路运动；然后，对“还乡团”家属进行深入的动员，通过他们去找回自己的丈夫和兄弟。临沭并在我军攻克破石桥毙伤大批“还乡团”后，立即通知伪属前往认尸，乘机进行敌我力量教育，使伪属都向我要通行证，表示：“死的抬回来，活的拖回来！”攻势发展下去，使群众性的争取与政府力量相结合，各县均广泛开展了一封信运动，各村群众纷纷写信给亲友，劝告失足者赶快回头。我民主政府亦不断在各地集市与要路上公开揭示“红黑点”和“生死簿”，警告“还乡团”给自己留活路，临沭生新庄“还乡团”由六百人垮至不到二百，沭河西李家荒原有千余“还乡团”，经蒋军整编调走二百余后，我方即进行政治攻势，现大部已逃亡。（未完待续）
The Coastal Region began to announce measures for dealing with the wheat fields of the "Homecoming Corps" at the beginning of the wheat season. According to a report by journalist Sha Hong: As the wheat harvest approached, various places combined with the revenge movement to universally register the wheat fields of the "Homecoming Corps" and fugitive households, and announced treatment measures (those without looting behavior will have their wheat collected and stored on their behalf, the ringleaders will have their wheat confiscated, and others will be decided by the masses based on their behavior and whether they return home to repent). As a result, the families of the "Homecoming Corps" and puppet self-defense forces who had not yet returned home were very anxious, and some immediately guaranteed to call back their relatives. After we took this measure, twenty-three fugitive households from Luozhuang in Donghai County returned within three days. In addition, for those who had taken up arms against us or reported hidden supplies to the enemy, simply publicizing leniency and calling on them to return home and start anew would not be effective, but would instead arouse their suspicion. According to their fear of crime, Linshu County proposed "atonement for crimes with meritorious service" to point out a way out for them. Within a few days, twelve people from Jishan and other districts returned with their guns, and XXX, an important member of the "Homecoming Corps" in Donghai, also sent a machine gun and several rifles. For example, the Tancheng Independent Regiment's annihilation of the "Homecoming Corps" to eliminate harm for the masses is an example of suppressing the main criminals. "Tancheng, July 14th: Lin Dechun, the head of the 'Homecoming Corps' in the Shuhe District, served as a puppet township head for several years during the enemy's occupation. After Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied Tancheng, he again held a puppet post and organized the 'Homecoming Corps', extorting the masses by saying, 'You can't be short me even a penny!' In the past few months, he extorted more than 700 silver dollars. The Lin XX family was forced to give up two shi and five dou of sorghum and one shi of wheat; Lin XX was forced to give up five mu of his seven mu of land; Ning XX's wife was forced to hang herself, and the salt shop and wheat market were forced to buy machine guns. In the month or so before and after the wheat harvest, he invited the Chiang Kai-shek army to 'sweep' five times, and the puppet county chief rewarded him with a box of bullets and four guns. The young people nearby, carrying hoes, squatted on the Maling Mountains day and night and said, 'With Lin Dechun in Hedong, we can't be at peace! It doesn't matter if he extorts all the money, we have to get rid of him!' In order to relieve the suffering of the masses, the county independent regiment, after more than ten days of reconnaissance and arrangement, cooperated with the armed work team on July 5th to surround Lin Dechun's troops in XX Village. In just over an hour, the entire unit was wiped out, and Lin Dechun and two communicators were burned to death in the 'Three Widows' house', capturing 18 enemies, killing and wounding 8, seizing 30 guns, more than 2,000 bullets, and 7 grenades. We suffered no casualties. During the battle, many people ran to the 'Three Widows' yard and told the soldiers, 'Lin Dechun is in that yard, throw a bomb quickly!'." According to a report by journalist Sha Hong, winning over the wavering elements of the "Homecoming Corps" and isolating the bad guys is the main way to combine suppression and launch a political offensive. June 14th: In this political offensive, each county has new creations. At the beginning of the offensive, the counties seized military victories in the restored areas and universally carried out current affairs propaganda. When the good news of Menglianggu came, various places successively held mass rallies at the district and township levels to celebrate the victory and mobilize to protect the wheat harvest. The Baihe District of Donghai also organized two mobile propaganda teams to conduct disguised propaganda in the border areas, guerrilla areas, and inland markets. Some of the propaganda team members explained current affairs, some managed propaganda sheds to explain current affairs cartoons, and some sang the story of Wu Laoer. The team was led by three or four sets of gongs and drums and large banners, which read "Report the great news from the front line" and "The war situation is about to change", creating a grand and exciting atmosphere. At such mass rallies and markets, the democratic government clearly announced its policies towards enemy and puppet personnel and general fugitive households, pointed out the path of life and death for them, and called on them to launch a movement to choose their path. Then, the families of the "Homecoming Corps" were mobilized in depth to find their husbands and brothers. After our army captured Poshitiao and killed and wounded a large number of "Homecoming Corps" members, Linshu immediately notified the puppet families to identify the bodies, taking the opportunity to conduct enemy-us strength education, so that the puppet families all asked me for passes, saying: "The dead will be carried back, and the living will be dragged back!" As the offensive developed, the mass mobilization was combined with the strength of the government. Various counties widely launched a letter writing campaign, with the masses in each village writing letters to their relatives and friends, advising those who had gone astray to turn back quickly. Our democratic government also constantly and publicly revealed the "red and black dots" and "book of life and death" in local markets and on important roads, warning the "Homecoming Corps" to leave a way out for themselves. The "Homecoming Corps" in Shengxinzhuang, Linshu, collapsed from 600 people to less than 200. There were more than 1,000 "Homecoming Corps" members in Lijia Huang, west of the Shu River. After Chiang Kai-shek's army reorganized and transferred more than 200 of them, we launched a political offensive, and most of them have now fled. (To be continued)

    （一）
    滨海自四月下旬至五月底，开展四十天的军政攻势，一方面表现出党委、军分区坚定英勇的决心，全心全意为人民服务；另一方面，也证明着军政攻势显示出群众力量。据六月十八日记者沙洪报导：“滨海军分区、滨南指挥部顷发表综合公报称：为配合华东野战军在泰安及孟良崮的两次歼灭战役，我滨南各种地方武装，基干兵团和各种游击队广泛出击，对临青路南‘还乡团’武装进行扫荡，四十天来已获重大战绩。自四月下旬至五月初，我基干兵团某某等部分三路插入滨南地区，先后收复沭河两岸敌据点八里巷、华埠、马站、三井村等处及欢（墩埠）沙（河）线以南之朱家汪、麻庄湖。并联系泰安大捷扩大宣传，当地军民莫不振奋！‘还乡团’妖气大挫，望风而逃，此为滨南攻势作战的第一阶段。自五月初至中旬，我军民继续扩大攻势，分别向陇海路沿线及临（沂）郯（城）路两侧进击，先后收复桃林、竹墩、石榴树、驼峰、曹埠等地，扫清马陵山东麓及陇海路北侧地区之蒋伪，并西越沂河，在庄坞、涌泉地区击溃郯城敌五十七师一个营，毙俘百人，此为第二阶段。自五月中旬至月底，为主动配合孟良崮大战，我东海、郯城军民，积极向陇海线南侧及郯城西南地区进展，攻克蒲汪据点，同时临沭军民配合某部，西迫李家庄敌据点，不断破袭临郯路，向东侧进逼欢墩埠，克复破石桥、庄主堂等地，并于敌二十八师沿临青路北调途中，以游击爆炸战步步阻击，西盘一战，毙敌数十名，此为第三阶段。自七月初旬以来，我各地武装，纷纷开赴边缘，掩护群众突击夏收，打击蒋伪抢麦活动，在沭河西岸郯城以北三十余里之柳沟一带围歼‘还乡团’百余，击溃蒋军一个营。我各县军民并以孟良崮大捷及保卫麦收为中心，对蒋伪展开猛烈的政治攻势，使‘还乡团’、伪自卫队大量瓦解。”沙洪另电报导政治攻势成绩：“滨海六月十四日讯：在麦收前，我滨南临沭、东海、郯城三县恢复区军民，配合泰安、孟良崮大捷及临青路南的军事扫荡，猛烈展开五月政治攻势。据初步统计，已争取‘还乡团’与伪自卫队员四三八三人回家自新，并带来枪支一部；四散逃亡者亦有一千二百三十余名；四月下旬蒋军进攻滨南期间，被骗逃往蒋占区之群众，已大部回家收麦，现恢复区社会秩序日益转趋安定繁荣。这一军政攻势，通过保卫麦收夏季作战，继续扩展，例如竹庭政治攻势在六月初一周间，瓦解‘还乡团’二百五十人，八百户回家收麦，其主要方式是‘武政结合’，‘先打后拉’；麦收前竹庭县以保卫麦收，反倒算，反抓丁为中心，展开政治攻势突击周；三阳区地方武装制成大批漫画传单，上写‘麦子黄又黄，恶霸地主莫胡想，你若割割群众麦，保管后路不永长’，以警告复辟地主。宋庄一带‘地主还乡团’都反映：‘八路可不说虚言，还是老实些好。’镇南区地方武装实行‘武政结合’，一面进至沙河逮捕‘还乡团’十七名，一面在各村召开歼蒋七十四师祝捷大会，并写了一百五十余封信给复辟地主，使东再金等三十余复辟地主不敢倒果实；在李瓦窑沟恶霸伪保长王举盛伏法影响下，三十余村自动停止资敌；三阳区多方揭发蒋政罪行，民主政府发动反抓丁动员会，号召与组织蒋占区青壮年拒绝参加伪“自卫团”。对伪政权‘还乡团’用红黑点实行善恶登记，定期公布善恶榜。城关等区群众，用“捎口信”办法，宣传解放军政策，被骗群众相继回家收麦者，据不完全统计，已有六百九十四户；另瓦解‘还乡团’二百五十六人外，俘蒋军蒋特六十七名。”
