  　Combining Agriculture and Sideline Occupations Transforms a Poor Village into a Prosperous One
    [Report from Jinnan, this newspaper, 27th] Yuanchao District's Fangge Village, through the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, with men and women helping each other in weaving winnowing baskets, has transformed from a poor village into a prosperous one. The village was originally poor, consisting of 39 households with 161 people, and over 600 mu of saline-alkali river land (averaging 2.8 mu of standard land per person). The annual harvest was never enough for food and clothing, relying entirely on the craft of weaving winnowing baskets to make up for the shortfall. According to a survey of 25 households last year, agricultural income only amounted to 9,983 jin of coarse grain, while expenditures required 22,200 jin of grain, leaving a deficit of 12,217 jin. Last winter and this spring, the entire village earned 452,400 yuan through handicrafts. Especially after the "July 1st" Congress called for increased production and organization, six more mutual aid groups were developed, totaling 46 people. These groups voluntarily formed from those who worked together with shared plows, and gradually integrated with winnowing basket weaving. At the same time, under the spirit of "everyone works when there is work" and "everyone eats when there is food," the original farm tools were uniformly allocated for use. From the tenth day of the sixth lunar month to the twentieth day of the eighth lunar month, with a capital of 43,500 yuan, the village wove winnowing baskets and sold 1,400 of them (each basket priced at approximately 1,100 yuan), with promissory notes for 1,780 jin of grain. Each 100 jin is valued at 20,000 yuan, totaling 356,000 yuan, yielding a net profit of 1,686,000 yuan excluding the principal. Additionally, six women's groups (totaling 39 women) earned over 300,000 yuan in two months; the total earnings from winnowing basket weaving reached 1,986,000 yuan. Thanks to mutual aid in production and diligent cultivation in agriculture (some plowing three to four times), the harvest was also quite good. The village produced an average of slightly less than 411 jin of grain per person. Due to mutual aid in agriculture and sideline occupations, wealth increased, and the entire village escaped the pit of poverty.

　　元朝房葛村
  　农副结合好　贫村变富村
    【本报冀南廿七日电】元朝一区房葛村农副结合，男女互助编簸箕，贫村变富。该村原是贫村，三十九户，一百六十一个人，洼碱河地六百余亩（每人合标准地二亩八分）年年收成不够吃穿，全靠编簸箕的手艺来补救缺额。根据去年二十五户的调查，农业收入仅合粗粮九千九百八十三斤，而开支需粮二万二千二百斤，尚差粮一万二千二百一十七斤。全村去冬今春，靠手艺赚了四十五万二千四百元。特别从“七一”大会号召增产和组织起来后，又发展了六个互助组，共四十六人，都是从合犋干活自愿结合起来的，又逐渐和编簸箕结合起来。同时在“有活大家干”“有饭大家吃”的精神下，把原有的农具都统一调剂使用。自阴历六月初十日到八月二十日止，以四万三千五百元资本，编制簸箕，已卖出一千四百个（每个簸箕约价一千一百元），存条子一千七百八十斤。每百斤以二万元计，共折款三十五万六千元，除本净获红利一百六十八万六千元。另六个妇女组（共三十九个妇女），两个月赚钱三十余万元；总计编簸箕共赚洋一百九十八万六千元。该村由于互助生产在农业上勤锄（有的锄三遍到四遍），收成也不错。全村每人合粮四百一十一斤弱。由于农副业互助，增加了财富，全村跳出贫困的穷坑。
