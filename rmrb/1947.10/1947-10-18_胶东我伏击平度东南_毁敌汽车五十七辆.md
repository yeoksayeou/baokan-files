Xinhua News Agency, Jiaodong Front, 16th: A unit of the Jiaodong People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces, ambushed Chiang's troops in the southeastern area of Pingdu, destroying fifty-seven enemy trucks in one fell swoop. At 3:00 PM on the 9th, a battalion of Chiang's troops from Pingdu, along with a tank regiment in sixty-four trucks, headed southeast towards Nancun. Simultaneously, three trucks of the Kuomintang reorganized 9th Division from Nancun headed northwest. When the sixty-seven Chiang's trucks, moving towards each other, reached the area of Zhanggezhuang and Guozhuang, the Jiaodong People's Liberation Army unit and local armed forces, who were lying in ambush there, launched a fierce attack. After half an hour of fierce fighting, all but ten of the Chiang's trucks, which fled in a panic, were completely destroyed by fire. An enemy battalion that came to reinforce from Nancun was also routed, with over a hundred killed or wounded, and more than forty prisoners captured, including tank crew members. Four submachine guns, twenty-three rifles, over two hundred shells, and a large quantity of military supplies were seized. According to prisoners, the destroyed trucks belonged to the Chiang bandit's "Rapid Column," which had been established only a few days earlier and suffered a heavy blow as soon as it was put into action. The Jiaodong Military Region Headquarters issued a commendation order for this victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Jiaodong Front, 16th: Delayed news: On the 5th and 6th, the People's Liberation Army ambushed a part of the Kuomintang reorganized 25th Division that invaded south from Yantai and Fushan areas around the Shizi Mountain (more than 30 miles south of Fushan), killing or wounding over six hundred and sixty enemy soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Jiaodong Front, 16th: The 211th Brigade of the Kuomintang 45th Division, which was completely annihilated by our forces in the Changyi South campaign, had all its main officers captured or killed. In addition to the previously reported Brigade Commander Zhang Zhongzhong, the prisoners include Xiao Dingxin, Director of the Political Department (i.e., the Press Office), Zhang Xianchen, Commander of the 1st Regiment, and Wang Wenhan, Commander of the 3rd Regiment. Furthermore, Li Zhengxi, the Commander of the 2nd Regiment, was killed in action.
