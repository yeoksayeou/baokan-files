　　Universal Love Men and Women Work Together
  　Temporary Mutual Aid for Harvesting and Planting
    [Reported from Bo'ai by our newspaper] At the joint meeting of district chiefs and branch secretaries of the entire county on the 9th, based on the current demands of the masses, it was decided to temporarily suspend the land reform movement and concentrate all efforts on a crash campaign for autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and wasteland reclamation. All government offices, except for one cadre to maintain operations, will participate in this campaign. The county has established an Autumn Harvest, Wheat Planting, and Wasteland Reclamation Committee, with a director, deputy director, and multiple committee members. It has five departments: Labor and Livestock Organization Department (responsible by the Finance and Grain Section), Armed Security Department (responsible by the Public Security Bureau and the Military Affairs Committee), Investigation and Statistics Department (responsible by the General Office), Propaganda and Mobilization Department (responsible by the County Propaganda Department and Education Section), and Agricultural Tool and Seed Adjustment Department (responsible by the Bank, Industry and Commerce Bureau, and Cooperatives). Twenty-two capable cadres were selected to form shock teams and dispatched to various districts to promote the work. More than 190 poor peasant and farmhand activists were selected from various villages and sent to border areas to help the masses with autumn harvesting and wheat planting. The county's 400 primary school teachers were organized into propaganda teams, dispersed to various villages to carry out propaganda campaigns, and the “Turn-Over Small Newspaper” was renamed "Wheat Planting Daily." According to investigations, there are currently over 50,000 mu of wasteland in the county, all of which that was cultivated last year must be completely reclaimed. The goal is to reclaim 20% to 30% of raw wasteland, first by controlling weeds and water, and concentrating efforts on land improvement, so that all wheat planting will be completed by November 15th.
    All districts have successively convened mobilization meetings for district and village cadres and meritorious individuals. The fifth, sixth, and seventh districts in the border areas have separately held large meetings of over 1,000 people and meetings of rotation team village armed cadres to resolve the issue of armed support for autumn harvesting and wheat planting, and to specifically calculate labor and livestock resources. Villages bordering these areas have finished plowing the stubble land and are currently planting wheat. For example, Guitun Village reaped 360 mu of grain and planted 1,500 mu of wheat in three days, ensuring that harvesting, threshing, and planting would be completed in five days. Large-scale mutual aid has been universally implemented in all districts, in various forms. Some are called "Turn-Over Production Mutual Aid Groups," while others are called "Family Mutual Aid Groups," with men, women, old, and young all involved in mutual aid. For example, in Xiashuimo Village in the second district, there are 527 male and female laborers, of which 408 have already joined mutual aid. Mutual aid emphasizes voluntary association and equivalent exchange, mostly based on assigned work per person, with two people equivalent to one animal force, and unified planning. In Beishizi Village in the second district, because there are few livestock, all men and women in the village were mobilized to implement temporary large-scale mutual aid. They finished the autumn harvest in two days and immediately began plowing and planting. Men plowed the land, women dug up corn stalks, and they competed with each other. They got up very early in the morning and were still plowing under the moonlight. The slogan is: "Organize to surpass machines, complete eight days of work in ten days." This will make autumn harvesting and wheat planting half a month faster than last year, and ensure the complete reclamation of wasteland. In order to reclaim all wasteland, the first district is trying to divert water through canals to dry the land quickly. Currently, movements are being vigorously carried out in various districts and villages. (Zhipeng, Liping, Maorong, Yuwen)

　　博爱男女齐下手
  　临时收种大互助
    【本报博爱讯】九号全县区长、分书联席会上，根据目前群众要求，决定暂停土改运动，全力突击收秋、种麦、灭荒大运动，各机关除留一个干部坚持工作外，全部参加这一运动，县里成立秋收、种麦、灭荒委员会，设主任副主任及委员多人，下设五部：劳畜力组织部（由财粮科负责）、武装保卫部（公安局、武委会负责）、调查统计部（办公室负责）、宣传鼓动部（县宣、教育科负责）、农具种子调剂部（银行、工商局、合作社负责），各区、村组织机构与县相同。并抽调有力干部廿二人，组成突击队，分赴各区推动工作，又从各村抽调贫雇骨干积极分子，一百九十余人，分赴边沿区帮助群众收秋种麦。将全县小学校教员四百余人组成宣传队，分散各村开展宣传运动，抽调中西医生，成立医疗队，减价为民看病，翻身小报改为种麦日报。据调查，全县现有荒地五万余亩，要求去年种过的全部消灭完，生荒消灭到百分之廿到三十，首先治草治水，全力修地，十一月十五号达到麦子全部种完。
    各区均先后召开了区村干部及功臣等动员会，边沿区五、六、七区都单独开了一千余人的大会和轮战队村武装干部会议，解决了武装支援秋收种麦，具体计算了劳畜力。接边地的村庄茬地已耕完，正在种麦，如贵屯村三天内抢割谷三百六十余亩，抢种麦子一千五百亩，保证五天收打、种完。各区普遍进行了大互助，形式不拘，有的叫翻身生产互助组，有的说是一家人互助组，男女老少都卷入互助中。如二区下水磨村男女劳力五百廿七个，参加互助的现已有四百零八个，在互助中强调了自愿结合及等价交换，大都是人定分，二人顶一畜力，统一计划。二区北十字村因为牲口少，全村男女齐动员，实行临时大互助，二天就把秋收完，马上开始耕种，男人耕地，女人刨玉茭秆，互相竞赛，清早起的都很早，月亮底下还在犁地，口号：“组织起来顶机器，十天营生八天完。”这样秋收种麦能比去年快半月，并保证消灭完荒地。一区为灭完荒地，先想法挑渠把水流去，地就快干。现各区村运动均在热烈开展着。（志鹏、李平、茂荣、玉温）
