　　Are the Crops in the Fields Good? Is There Enough Firewood and Water at Home?
  　Longhu and Other Villages Conduct Mid-Autumn Festival Inspection of Preferential Treatment for Military Dependents and Resistance Fighters
    [This newspaper, Wu'an news] Longhu Village has a total of 39 households of resistance dependents, 9 households of martyrs' dependents, 10 demobilized and retired soldiers, and 7 government officials, totaling 205 people. They have a total of 627.8 mu of land. In addition to being cultivated by each household, there are still 170 mu of land cultivated on behalf of the entire village. This year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival inspection of preferential treatment, everyone decided: This year's Mid-Autumn Festival will be different from previous years. In order to save production and support the front line, instead of using pork, white flour, and fruit to comfort the resistance dependents, we will first go to the fields of the resistance dependents to check whether the autumn crops are growing well, whether the wheat has emerged, whether there is enough millet, and whether enough fertilizer has been applied. Each street will make a summary, and then check household by household whether there is enough firewood to burn and whether the water tanks are full. On the evening of the August 15th, all the resistance dependents will be invited to a conference to allow the resistance dependents to give opinions to the cadres. This is both economical and practical condolence. (Li Zhanqing, Li Tongyin, Jia Lin)
    [This newspaper, Shexian news] After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Chi Youjun Committee proposed to check the quality of preferential treatment for military dependents' families in the fields. During the inspection, it was found that Liu Xichang's land was not planted with pumpkins and not much fertilizer was applied. In the evening, cadres held a forum with military dependents, retired soldiers, and group leaders. Military dependent Liu Gongtang proposed that the sixth group can plant pumpkins themselves, but they don't plant pumpkins for the military dependents, hoeing is late, fertilization is not much, and the crops do not grow well. Retired soldier Liu Desheng proposed that the land is far away, his labor is not good, and he doesn't have a woman to make clothes, etc. After inspection, a solution was decided. That night, five models were selected, including military dependents Liu Yonghua and Liu Kelan. (Quan You)
    [This newspaper, Changzhi news] In Xihuo Town, the Fourth District, on the 11th day of the eighth lunar month, 42 mutual aid team leaders from the entire village were convened to discuss military protection work. There are a total of 77 military dependents in the village. The original 24.5 mu of old wheat land has been completely planted. Only more than 20 mu of the 80 mu of stubble wheat land has been planted. Everyone competed to challenge and guaranteed to plant the stubble wheat land for the military dependents before the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. Jiao Qifu said: During the Mid-Autumn Festival, we will have dinner in groups, which can also help us understand the actual situation of the military dependents' families. The family members of the "Li Buzu" who went south will also receive the same preferential treatment. (Xihuo Town Communications Group)

　　地里庄稼好不好？家中柴水够不够？
  　龙虎等村中秋检查优抗
    【本报武安讯】龙虎村共有抗属三十九户，烈属九户，荣退军人十人，政府机关人员七户，共计有人口二百零五口，他们共有地六百二十七亩八分，除由各家自种外，尚有一百七十亩地归全村代耕。今年中秋节检查优抗，大家决定：今年过八月和往年不同，为节约生产支援前线，不是用猪肉、白面、果子去慰问抗属，而是先到抗属地里去检查秋庄稼长的好不好，麦子出来没有，谷子够不够苗，粪上的足不足，各街做一个总结，再挨户检查柴是否够烧？水是否满缸？八月十五晚上把抗属都请来开一个大会，让抗属给干部们提意见，这是又节约又实际的慰问。（李占清、李同银、贾琳）
    【本报涉县讯】中秋节后池优军委员会提出检查军属家庭地里优待好坏，检查中发现刘希昌地没有栽南瓜，并上肥不多等问题，晚上干部召开军属荣退军人和代耕组长座谈会，军属刘功堂提出六组代耕自己能栽南瓜，不给军属栽南瓜，锄地又迟上肥也不多，庄稼长的不好。荣退军人刘得胜提出地远，自己劳力不好并没女人做衣服等问题，经检查后决定了解决办法。当晚选了军属刘永花、刘克兰等五名模范。（全有）
    【本报长治讯】四区西火镇，在阴历八月十一日，召集全村四十二个互助组组长商讨护军工作，全村共军属七十七户，原有老麦地二十四、五亩已种完。改茬麦地八十亩才种了二十余亩。大家争先挑战保证在八月十五日前，把改茬麦地给抗属种完。焦起富说：中秋节咱们分组请吃饭，也能了解军属家的实际情况，南下干部家属“李不足”也同样的优待。（西火镇通讯组）
