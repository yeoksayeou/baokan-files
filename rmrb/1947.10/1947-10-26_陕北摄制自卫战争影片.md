　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Films Self-Defense War
　　Since the Jiang-Hu bandit troops attacked Yan'an, Jinchaji photographers Cheng Mo and Ling Feng have gone to the front lines to film. After half a year of effort, they have now completed 3,500 feet of newsreel footage, including the self-defense mobilization before and after the defense of Yan'an, and the heroic deeds of the border region's military and civilians in the @Gan Blocking Battle and the Qinghuabian Panlong battles. Comrades Cheng and Ling are now stepping up the filming of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao's insistence on working in northern Shaanxi, as well as the border region farmers' enthusiastic participation in the army. It is estimated that the entire film will be more than 5,000 feet, and after it is filmed, copies will be quickly made and shown to the audience.
