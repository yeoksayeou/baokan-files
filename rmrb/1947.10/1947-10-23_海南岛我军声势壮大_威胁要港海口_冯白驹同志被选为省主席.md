The People's Liberation Army of Hainan Island, led by Comrade Feng Baiju, is growing in strength and is advancing towards Lushan, Danxian, and Haikou City. Guangzhou Bay, which is adjacent to Hainan Island, is also under martial law. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Guangzhou on the 15th, the Hainan Island People's Armed Forces now control the three counties of Baoting, Baisha, and Ledong, and have elected Feng Baiju as Chairman of the Province. The local people's armed forces have reached more than 10,000. Since the 20th of September, they have begun to threaten Haikou, the main port of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits on Hainan Island. Furthermore, 3,000 people's armed forces have crossed Hainan and arrived in the Leizhou Peninsula to establish new liberated areas.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 20th, after the Jiangnan People's Guerrilla Force cut off the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway and the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were terrified. They hurriedly sent their "Railway Guard" to "reinforce" the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Chiang Kai-shek's "Ministry of National Defense" sent Wu Hanying (transliteration) to "inspect the roadside defenses" and forcibly occupied civilian houses as barracks for "reinforcement troops."

    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据二十日美联社南京电讯透露：江南人民游击队斩断（南）京、杭（州）公路及杭（州）、徽（州）公路后，蒋匪心惊胆战，忙派其“铁路警卫队”“增援”沪（上海）宁（南京）铁路，蒋匪“国防部”派吴汉英（译音）“视察沿路防御”，并强占民间房屋以作“增援部队”之营房。
