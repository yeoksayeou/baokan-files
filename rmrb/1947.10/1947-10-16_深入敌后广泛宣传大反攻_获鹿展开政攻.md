　　Penetrate Deep into Enemy Rear Areas to Widely Publicize the Great Counter-Offensive
  　Huolu Launches Political Offensive
    [Our Newspaper Huolu News] Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the enemy frantically seized grain, initially causing great losses to the masses. At that time, cadres and the masses believed that the enemy's strength had increased, but after research, it was realized that the enemy's strength had not increased, but that they were starving and desperately seizing grain to maintain their lives. How to overwhelm the enemy? Coordinating with the victorious situation of today's great counter-offensive, a Mid-Autumn Festival "explosion" political offensive was launched. Starting from the twelfth day of the eighth lunar month, militia cadres extended forward, distributing propaganda materials about the victory of the great counter-offensive, exciting the masses in the enemy's rear. Villages in the rear quickly harvested and hid their crops. This vigorous effort stunned the enemy. Everywhere they heard news of our army's large-scale counter-offensive, and they felt that staying was hopeless. At night, the enemy's rear became our world. Cadres and militiamen extended into the enemy's rear villages, shouting slogans, broadcasting, and spreading propaganda to every village in the enemy's rear. When cadres from the Second District distributed propaganda in the enemy's rear, the masses scrambled to see it. They said, "The weather is clearing up, and the old woman's bound-foot soldiers (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang army) won't stick around." By the time the enemy realized what was happening, we had already moved to other villages. This wandering activity in the enemy's rear was a great excitement and encouragement to the masses in the enemy's rear, and gave the local tyrants a great threat. The political offensive of the Second District on the night of the fourteenth day of the eighth lunar month scared even the puppet county magistrate in the city away. The puppet township head, Huang Jiuqiu, after seeing the "repentance bag" (containing propaganda and a letter) that was given to him, said, "I have done so many bad things, what will be my fate? The Eighth Route Army is distributing grain, and I can't resist it. Just turn your back on me, you (referring to the masses) can do whatever you want!" The masses actively handed over grain for the counter-offensive, and propaganda became a powerful psychological weapon, combined with landmine warfare. On October 1st, more than 300 enemies attacked Sanzhaikou to seize grain. Landmines exploded under saddles, under chopping knives, inside cabinets, and on doors, wounding or killing seven enemies. The enemy dared not enter the houses. When they set out again, they carried two-zhang-long poles (approximately 6.6 meters). The masses happily said, "Landmines are really useful; they are our guard dogs. When the enemy comes, they eat their meat." In the political offensive, the Third District bravely extended into the enemy's rear. On October 5th, in one night, they covered eight villages in the enemy's rear, spreading propaganda outside the enemy's strongholds and using bows to shoot propaganda into the enemy's moats. At the same time, they protected the villages on the central line of the enemy-occupied area, who actively delivered public grain. Everyone's morale was boosted a hundredfold. They all said, "The enemy is just talking nonsense. As long as we analyze the enemy's situation, exploit their weaknesses, and take the initiative, we can defeat the enemy and extend our work into the enemy's rear!" This experience encouraged the county's political offensive to develop rapidly. (Xù Tíng)

　　深入敌后广泛宣传大反攻
  　获鹿展开政攻
    【本报获鹿讯】敌人在中秋前后，疯狂抢粮，起初群众受到很大的损失，当时干部群众，认为敌人力量增大了，但经研究后，才知道敌人力量不是增大了，而是饿慌了，拼命的抢夺粮食，维持他的生命。如何压倒敌人呢？配合今天大反攻的胜利形势，便开展了中秋爆炸政治攻势。从阴历八月十二日开始，民兵干部伸向前方，散发大反攻胜利的宣传品，兴奋了敌后群众，后方村庄即赶收、赶藏。这样轰轰烈烈的一搞，敌人瞪了眼，到处听见我军大举反攻的消息，感到呆下去没前途；一到晚上，敌后便成了我们的世界，干部民兵伸到敌后村庄，喊话、广播，宣传品散遍了敌后每个村庄。二区干部，到敌后散宣传品时，群众争着要看，他们说：“天快晴了，老娘的裹脚军（指老蒋的国军）不沾了。”等敌人发觉时，我们已转到了别的村，这样辗转的在敌后活动，对敌后群众是很大的兴奋和鼓舞，给了土顽们很大的威胁。二区在阴历八月十四日夜间的政攻，将城内伪县长都吓跑了，伪乡长黄九秋，看了送给他的“回心袋”（内装宣传品、信），他说：“我作了这许多坏事，落个什么下场呢？八路军派粮，我也顶不住，只要背转我，你们（指群众）随便吧！”群众纷纷交纳反攻粮食，宣传品成了有力的攻心弹，并结合地雷战。十月一日，敌人三百余，进攻三寨抢粮，鞍子底下，铡刀底下，柜里边，门子上，雷都响了，炸伤亡敌七人，敌人不敢进家了，再出发时，扛上两丈长的杆子，群众高兴的说：“地雷真顶事，是咱们的看家狗，敌人来了吃他的肉。”三区在政攻中，奋勇伸到敌后，十月五日，一晚上即踏遍了敌后八个村，将宣传品散到敌人据点外，并且拉弓，将宣传品射到敌人围壕内。同时又掩护了敌我交界上的中线村，纷纷送交公粮。大家情绪高涨百倍，都说：“敌人才扯蛋，只要我们分析敌人情况，钻敌人空子，主动的去干，是能够战胜敌人，伸到敌后工作的！”由于这一体验，鼓舞了全县政攻正迅速开展。（绪亭）
