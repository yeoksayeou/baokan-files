　　【Taiyue, This Newspaper, 7th】 At the district's summary meeting on cutting artemisia and sowing wheat on the 1st of this month, Wangjiayuan in Qinyuan was recognized as a model for organizing women and children's semi-labor. The village has 71 full laborers, 40 of whom are participating in the war and expeditions, and some are sick. The remaining people need to weave baskets, so there are no full laborers left to use for sowing wheat and cutting artemisia. Therefore, they organized all 26 elderly men, 120 women and children in the village in a cooperative manner to carry out large-scale labor exchange and launched a competition. In three days, they cut more than 182,000 catties of artemisia. The 120 women and children alone cut 112,000 catties. He Qiuying and Liu Meiying said: "Although we are women, we must be stronger than men and must not fall behind!" Wen Fulan cut 2,500 catties of artemisia in three days and was selected as a model. All 21 livestock in the village were managed by 26 elderly men, who were solely responsible for plowing, sowing, and fertilizing. Women and children pulled livestock, broke up soil clods, collected manure, and cut grass. Old women took care of the children. In order to prevent women from delaying their working time, they divided the children into groups of four or five and provided them with some dry food, allowing the old women to take care of them separately. For example, the elderly Jin Yuan took care of 12 children alone. With such specific division of labor, everyone took action and strived to be the first. All 670 mu of wheat land in the village were sown in 20 days, and now they are rushing to harvest the autumn crops.

　　组织妇女儿童王家园是模范
    【本报太岳七日电】沁源王家园在本月一日在区总结割蒿种麦的大会上，被评为组织妇女儿童半劳力的模范。该村有全劳力七十一人，参战远征四十人，还有些病人，余下的要打蓝，所以全村已没有全劳力用到种麦割蒿上，于是他们以一搅子的形式，把全村二十六个老汉、一百二十个妇女、儿童都组织起来，进行大变工，并展开竞赛，三天就割蒿十八万二千余斤，单一百二十个妇女、儿童就割了十一万二千斤。何秋英、刘梅英说：“咱虽是妇女，还要比男人强些，一定不落后！”温富蓝一人三天割蒿二千五百斤，被选为模范。全村二十一犋牲口，让二十六个老汉掌握，专负犁地、摇耧、下籽的责任，妇女、儿童拉牲口、打土疙瘩、拾粪、割草，老婆婆看孩子；为使妇女不耽误劳动时间，并把小孩子组成四个、五个一组，并给烧些干粮，让老婆婆们分别照顾，如金元老人两个人即照管了十二个孩子。这样具体分工，人人动手，个个争先，全村六百七十余亩麦地，经二十天已全部种完，现正突击秋收。
