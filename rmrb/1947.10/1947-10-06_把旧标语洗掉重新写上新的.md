To the Editor:

　　We are now in a full-scale counter-offensive, and the masses in various places are jubilantly celebrating victory. However, in many villages, old slogans from the War of Resistance Against Japan are still written on the walls. For example, in Huangniuti Village (Lucheng), there are still a great number of old slogans, such as "The Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and China are surrounding Japan on all sides, and Japan's death is imminent," "Celebrating the Sino-American New Treaty, abolishing unequal treaties," "Hitler has committed suicide, Mussolini has been executed, and Japan is surrounded," etc. These old slogans were only completely washed away and replaced with new slogans during the celebration meeting for the victory of the great counter-offensive. Therefore, I offer this suggestion to all areas, urging district and village cadres, as well as primary school teachers, to personally conduct detailed inspections. If such slogans are found, they should be washed away immediately, without being taken lightly or being considered a troublesome task. (Shi Shichang)

　　把旧标语洗掉重新写上新的编辑同志：
    现在正在全面大反攻，各地群众都在欢腾热狂的庆贺胜利，但有很多村，墙上还写着抗战以来的旧标语。如黄牛蹄村（潞城）旧标语还非常之多，如“苏英美中把日本四面包围起来，日本的死亡就在眼前”，“庆祝中美新约，废除不平等条约”。“希特勒自毙了，墨索里尼枪决了，日本被包围了”等旧标语，这次在开庆祝大反攻胜利会时，才全部洗刷净了，重新写上了新的标语。因此我提供各地这个意见，让各地区、村干部及小学教员同志，亲自详细检查，如有者，立即洗刷干净，万不要轻视或害麻烦。（史士长）
