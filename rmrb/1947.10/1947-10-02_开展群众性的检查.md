　　Launching a Mass Inspection
    The opinions of Comrades Ding Ding and others on this newspaper, published today, illustrate the "ivory tower" work style and unstable stance that exist in our editorial work. This is very important for us to examine ourselves and improve our work. Regarding the news item "Civil Affairs Section Chief Shi Zongle Supports Thoroughly Struggling Against His Own Family," in addition to asking the Taiyue Branch to investigate and report on the actual situation, the error in our editorial work is that we did not evaluate the value of the news from the standpoint of the peasants, and we did not estimate this "support" with the feelings of the peasants. That is to say, the handling of this news was from the perspective of the landlord Shi Zonghong, congratulating him on escaping the direct struggle of the peasants; it praised the "mobilization" that hindered the peasants from thoroughly struggling against the landlord. Because Comrade Shi Zongle expressed his attitude at the mass meeting, did he break the "sentiment" of the masses, or did he deepen the "sentiment"? Later, some silver ingots and wealth were taken out. Have the masses really considered the struggle to be thorough? All of this is worth questioning. The publication of this news, as far as its influence is concerned, will inevitably "confuse the masses and confuse the cadres," and is a completely unacceptable reflection of landlord sentiments.
    In the past month, workers at this newspaper have been conducting a three-check campaign to correct their stance, transform their work style, and rectify their ranks. According to preliminary understanding in the three-check campaign, most of our editorial staff come from landlord families. Although they have been tempered by the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Self-Defense War, they often do not deeply understand the demands of the peasants on the land reform issue, and cannot consciously stand on the peasants' stand to observe and handle problems, showing vagueness and wavering, or even losing their stand and speaking for the landlords. Furthermore, due to an incorrect and unstable stance, a careless and perfunctory work style is produced, with countless typos and grammatical errors.
    The People's Daily is the newspaper of the people, and every word and sentence it publishes should conform to the interests of the people. The workers of the People's Daily, because of their work—the Party newspaper—meet the people every day, its influence is rapid and universal, and therefore, they must always be vigilant about their own ideological "air-raid shelters," and must resolutely and thoroughly carry out inspections and correct mistakes. Otherwise, they will become laggards of the times, and will be driven out of the glorious post of "People's Throat." Our three-check movement is being carried out to achieve the purpose of transforming ourselves and improving our work. However, we feel that self-examination alone is not comprehensive and cannot achieve a deeper and more thorough effect. We hope to launch a mass movement to inspect the newspaper, hoping that the broad masses of readers will seriously and unceremoniously inspect our work with the attitude of masters, and expose all news reports that have lost their stand or have an unstable stand, all distortions of facts, fabrications, erroneous deletions and revisions, and inappropriate commendations! Through this mass inspection and exposure, and the in-depth self-reflection and learning of ourselves, can we truly achieve the goal of rectifying the news ranks and transforming the Party newspaper.

### 开展群众性的检查

专栏：短论

　　开展群众性的检查
    今日所载丁丁等同志对本报的意见，说明我们编辑工作中存在着“客里空”作风与立场不稳之错误，这对我们检讨自己提高工作都十分重要。“民运科长师宗乐撑腰斗透自己家”这一条新闻，除请太岳分社加以检查并报导其实际情况外，在我们编辑工作的错误，是没有站在农民的立场上来估量新闻的价值，不是以农民的情感来估计这一“撑腰”。这就是说，这条新闻的处理，是站在地主师宗鸿方面说话，庆贺他逃脱了农民的直接斗争；表扬了阻碍农民彻底斗透地主的“动员”，因为师宗乐同志在群众大会表示了态度，到底是打破了群众的“情面”，还是加深了“情面”？以后拿出了一些元宝财物，群众是否真正已认为斗争彻底？都值得怀疑。这新闻的发表，影响所及，必然“迷惑群众，迷惑干部”，是完全要不得的地主情绪的反映。
    月来，本报工作者，正为端正立场，改造作风，严整阵容而进行三查。在三查中据初步了解，我们编辑工作者，大部分家庭成份是地主，虽然自己经过抗日与自卫战争的锻炼，但在土地改革问题上，往往体会农民要求不深，不能自觉地站在农民立场来观察与处理问题，表现模糊与动摇，甚或失掉立场替地主讲了话。又由于立场不正不稳，也就产生粗枝大叶，敷衍了事，错字错句层出不穷的不良作风。
    人民日报是人民的报纸，它所刊载一字一句，都应符合人民的利益。人民日报的工作者，因为它的工作——党报，天天和人民见面，其影响迅速而普遍，因而更须时刻警惕自己思想“防空洞”，且须坚决彻底进行检查，改正错误，否则就会沦为时代的落伍者，就会被人民赶出“人民喉咙”的光荣岗位。我们的三查运动，就是为求达到改造自己改进工作的目的而进行的。但我们感到仅仅自己检查，不能够全面，不能获致更深刻更彻底的效果。我们希望开展一个群众性的检查报纸运动，希望广大读者广大群众，对我们的工作，以主人翁的态度，认真的毫不客气的进行检查，把一切失掉立场或立场不稳的新闻通讯，把一切歪曲事实、无中生有、删改错误，表扬失当，等等都揭发出来！通过这种群众性的检查揭露与我们自己反省学习的深入，才能真正达到整顿新闻阵容与改造党报的目的。
