Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 15th, General Li Jishen, in an interview with an Associated Press reporter, stated that the development of the war situation proves that Chiang Kai-shek is bound to fail, and a democratic coalition government including patriotic democratic parties from across the country will inevitably be realized. Li stated: "The Manchurian (Chiang) troops have already launched their second defensive war. This fact, coupled with their declining morale, guarantees their ultimate failure. Once the Kuomintang (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) is completely defeated, the CCP will come forward to lead the realization of a coalition government with Kuomintang liberals and the Democratic League. Such a coalition government will definitely be more beneficial to China than the current (Chiang) government. The current (Chiang) government is merely a greedy and selfish dictatorial government." Li pointed out that Chinese Communists and Kuomintang members loyal to Sun Yat-sen must work together for China. Regarding American imperialist aid to Chiang in the civil war and interference in China's internal affairs, Li expressed "regret," and pointed out that American aid to Chiang has caused "endless harm" to China both now and in the future. Regarding Marshall, who is carrying out aid to Chiang in the civil war, Li said: "His thinking is exactly the same as Chiang Kai-shek's." Li forcefully stated: "Once the voice of the Chinese people becomes loud and clear, China will become a great power in the world, and this is something that will be realized very soon."

　　李济琛将军发表谈话
  　战局显示蒋美必败联合政府一定实现
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据美联社香港十五日电：李济琛将军接见美联社记者发表谈话，指出战局的发展证明蒋介石一定失败，包括全国爱国民主党派的民主的联合政府必然实现。李氏称：“满洲国（蒋）军已经第二度进行防御战。这种事实加上日益低落的士气，就保证他们一定要失败。一旦国民党（指蒋介石集团）完全失败了，中共就会出而领导与国民党自由主义分子及民主同盟实现联合政府。这样的联合政府，一定会比现在的（蒋）政府对中国更为有益。现在的（蒋）政府只是一个贪婪自私的独裁政府。”李氏指出中国共产党人与忠实于孙中山的国民党人必须为中国而共同努力。对于美国帝国主义援蒋内战干涉中国内政，李氏表示“遗憾，”并指出美国的援蒋已使中国现在及将来“受害无穷。”对于执行援蒋内战的马歇尔，李氏说：“他的思想和蒋介石一模一样。”李氏力称：“一旦中国人民的声音变得宏亮起来，中国就会成为世界的大国，而这已经是很快就会实现的事了。”
