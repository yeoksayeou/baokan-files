　　Xin Zhuang Coal Mine's Squeeze-Out-Feudalism Movement

　　The Xin Zhuang Coal Mine in Anyang was liberated in early April this year, and we only took over and resumed work on May 16th. Because it was a new area, most workers still held the old idea of "whoever pays, works for them" and "forming gangs to trick the factory." Although a group of cadres, workers, and staff who had been tempered through struggle were sent from the Western Front in June, they also felt frustrated because the majority of the factory members were old, and they "couldn't fit in." Unintentionally, this created "eastern cliques and western cliques" of mountain strongholds and sectarianism. Under these circumstances, righteousness dared not raise its head, which facilitated landlords and saboteurs to exploit our loopholes, stir up trouble in the factory, undermine unity, and continuously cause problems such as beatings, dragging people, slowdowns, sabotage, corruption, and waste, causing us considerable losses.

　　Based on this foundation, to carry out an intense squeeze-out-feudalism and anti-traitor struggle, we had to make full ideological and organizational preparations in advance.

　　I. Our preparations were carried out as follows:

　　First, we conducted ideological self-criticism among party members in the branch, and found that the party members' complacency was the main obstacle to carrying out the movement. In order to break through "complacency" and awaken "class consciousness," the trade union selected workers and staff members who were from poor backgrounds and had suffered hardships (not necessarily activists, but the vast majority later became activists) and held several days of training classes. Through the training classes' recounting grievances, discussions, and digging up the roots of poverty, the class consciousness of the workers and staff was awakened, and they expressed their determination to completely break with feudalism and resolutely squeeze out feudalism. It was proven later in the movement that the training class played a key role and backbone role. Without this ideological preparation, it would have been impossible to carry out a squeeze-out-feudalism struggle in such a factory.

　　Second, we conducted investigations to understand the family circumstances, social activities, and historical backgrounds of some of the targets of the struggle who had infiltrated the factory. This work was carried out in the factory by mobilizing everyone to write autobiographies, and at the same time, sending people to their counties and villages to solicit opinions from village cadres and the masses about them. This work was necessary.

　　Third, we consulted with local authorities to coordinate and cooperate to unify our steps. At the beginning of this work, we jointly studied with the Anyang County Party Committee and the Second District Party Committee, exchanged information we had mutually learned, and studied the handling methods for the feudal landlords who were squeezed out. District and village cadres assisted in reviewing and registering workers, cleaning up targets of struggle and those with unclear backgrounds, prohibiting them from joining the trade union, and prohibiting them from going down the mine. The District Party Secretary participated in the coal mine leadership meeting, and the coal mine extracted cadres to participate in local mass mobilization work, assisting the district in training activists, etc. We also sent people to contact the Lin County Party Committee.

　　II. Launching grievance-telling to promote the movement; everyone examines and digs up roots.

　　This movement first broke through from the livelihood issues that workers and the masses were most concerned about. Because there was a lot of waste of public money in administrative work, but the lives of workers were very bad. Shen Wenjie, who handled administrative work, was a target of struggle who had infiltrated. His father was a local tyrant who served as a stubborn Baozhang for several terms. He colluded with the notorious local tyrant Li Hu in the village to oppress the masses. At the struggle meeting, the masses recounted many of his crimes: such as giving everyone black oil to eat, reporting the black oil as lamp oil expenses, but leaving a blank space for sesame oil price on the food bill. Buying bad rice and reporting the price of good rice. Forcing three cooks to lend him five thousand yuan each to join the cooperative. Sowing discord between Shanxi people and Henan people, sowing discord between superiors and subordinates, and enticing young people to learn bad things from him... Under the accusations of the masses, his fox tail could no longer be concealed, and he confessed that he had participated in the "Revival Society" led by Li Hu, and was instructed by Li Hu and Li Delong to come to the economic department to do sabotage work.

　　Through telling grievances and taking action, the masses further awakened their class consciousness. At the same time, the public confession of landlords and bad elements made everyone clearer that the problems that occurred in the factory one after another were entirely caused by saboteurs. From exposing bad deeds to finding bad roots. For example: (1) Attacking activists: Wei Shouxiu and Mo Zhengrong worked actively and were praised and rewarded by the leadership. Shen Wenjie deliberately told the masses that they were not qualified, "Whoever licks the leader can become a model." As soon as he saw someone working hard, he would sarcastically say, "They want to be activists!" (2) Sabotaging machine repair: For example, Su Yongxiang said to machinist Gao Zhanlin: "Why are you still working so hard? If the parts don't match, don't bother. You draw the drawings and hand them over to the engineering department. If something goes wrong, you won't be responsible. Just go with the flow, and they won't be able to find you later." Gao Zhanlin was fooled by Su Yongxiang. He didn't inspect the machine when he should have, and let it grind dry without oil in the cylinder. He took a few pounds of oil to cook with, and didn't repair the parts that should have been repaired. As a result, the car broke down and the gear was damaged. (3) Sowing discord among cadres: For example, Shen Wenjie said to accountant Shen Mingli: "You Shanxi people are getting away with it. Director Du is from Shanxi, and Shanxi people can carry guns. Henan people are not getting away with it." Attempting to incite sectarian contradictions. He also instigated Yang Wensheng to disobey the leadership. There were many other facts, such as wasting resources.

　　III. Two issues that the leadership should pay attention to:

　　(1) It is necessary to implement the policy of bold release and letting go. Only by trusting the masses and earnestly implementing the mass line leadership method can problems be handled correctly. Because most of the factory's leading cadres lack experience in mass work, after breaking through Shen Wenjie's political problem at the beginning of the movement, they abandoned the vast majority of workers and masses, delved into a narrow circle, and simply conducted two days of interrogation work. Without the masses understanding their criminal facts, four suspected criminals involved in the interrogation were arrested and detained. This did not gain the sympathy of the majority of the masses, but instead created terror among some of the masses. The leadership group did not trust the masses, and even suspected that their own party members were unreliable for sending a quilt to the arrested people. The policy of how to mobilize the masses was completely confused for a time. Fortunately, this detour was not long. After review and research, the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses was clarified. After studying the leadership methods of the district party committee's experience in land reform, which included releasing the masses and implementing the mass line, and based on the problems that occurred in their own work, the root of the ideological problems in the leadership was examined. The main problem was not trusting the masses, not going deep into the masses, and not understanding the actual situation of the masses' thinking. After studying and reviewing, the leading cadres participated in the discussions of the various groups, synthesized the discussion situation of the various groups to study the thinking of the masses, and then organized a public trial of Shen Wenjie, proposing to expose bad deeds and dig up bad roots. The leadership focused on grasping the enlightenment of the masses' class consciousness, educating the masses with their own grievances, and educating the masses with the materials of sabotage by landlords and bad elements. The movement developed in the following twenty days, adopting the method of group deliberation combined with mass struggle. Group deliberation prepared for mass struggle, and mass struggle promoted group deliberation to develop more deeply, until the masses themselves drew clear class boundaries and ideological boundaries.

　　(2) It is necessary to pay attention to grasping class policies. Exposing bad deeds and pursuing bad roots generally makes it easy for the targets of struggle to bow their heads and submit to the masses, because a pile of facts has been exposed by the masses, making it impossible for them to quibble. Even if they sophistically argue, it is easier to arouse the hatred of the masses and treat them impolitely. However, what the leadership should grasp is that the "bad roots" of doing bad things must be class enemies of the masses, otherwise it may be pursued in a mess, disrupting their own class ranks. Because the phrase "pursue the facts of sabotage first" does not have a clear class nature, some people in their own ranks also have some shortcomings. For the shortcomings of some people in their own ranks, we should adopt the policy of washing the face and wiping off the black, and educating them. This time, we exposed some shortcomings of a trade union cadre during the exposure. The masses were very angry, almost developing into a temporary main contradiction. After the leadership studied, they persuaded the masses and turned around, concentrating their firepower on the landlord class.

### 辛庄煤矿挤封建运动

　　辛庄煤矿挤封建运动
    安阳辛庄煤矿，是今年四月初解放，五月十六日我们才接收复工。因为是新区，大部分工人对工厂仍然是“谁给钱、给谁受”，“结成帮，弄厂方”的旧思想。虽然六月间从西线派来了一部分经过斗争锻炼的职员工人，但因为工厂是旧的成员占多数，他们也苦闷着“人地两生，插不进去”，无意地反形成“东一伙、西一伙”的山头宗派。在这个情况下，正气是不敢抬头的，因此也便利了地主破坏分子钻我们的空子，在厂内挑动是非，破坏团结，接连不断的发生打人、拖人、怠工、破坏、贪污、浪费等问题，使我们受到不少的损失。
    在这样的基础上，要开展紧张的挤封建反奸斗争，事先就必须有充分的思想准备和组织准备。
    一、我们的准备工作是这样进行的：
    第一、首先在支部党员中作了思想检查，发现支部党员的麻痹思想是开展运动的主要绊脚石。为了打破“麻痹”，唤醒“阶级自觉”，就由职工会选择了出身贫苦、受过折磨的工人职员，（不一定是积极分子，但以后绝大多数都变成积极分子。）开了几天训练班。经过训练班的诉苦、讨论、挖穷根，启发了职工的阶级觉悟，表示要跟封建彻底分家，坚决把封建挤干净。以后在运动中证明，训练班起了钥匙作用和骨干作用，如果没有这个思想准备，在这样的一个工厂开展起挤封建斗争，是不可能的。
    第二、进行了调查，了解了钻进工厂来的一些斗争对象的家庭情况社会活动和他的出身历史。这一工作的进行，在厂内是经过动员每个人写自传，同时派出人到他们所在县所在村征求村干部、群众对他们的意见，这个工作是必要的。
    第三、与地方商讨协助配合，统一步调。在开始这一工作时，我们就和安阳县委、二区区委共同研究，交换了相互了解的一些情况，研究了被挤出去的封建地主处理办法，由区村干部协助审查登记工人，清洗斗争对象及面目不清分子，不许他们参加工会，不许他们下窑。区委书记参加煤矿领导会议，煤矿上抽出干部参加地方发动群众工作，协助区上集训积极分子等。我们并派人与林县县委联系。
    二、发动诉苦推进运动，大家检举大家挖根。
    这次运动，首先是从职工群众最关心的生活问题突破的。因为事务工作上，给公家浪费的钱很多，职工的生活搞的却很坏。办事务工作的申文杰，就是个钻进来的斗争对象，他父亲就是个恶霸，当了几任顽固保长，他在村里和有名的恶霸李虎勾结，欺压群众。在斗争会上，群众诉出了他很多罪恶：如给大家吃黑油，把吃了的黑油报销了灯火费，却在火食帐上空出一笔香油价钱。买了坏米报好米价钱。强迫三个火夫，每人借给他五千元，入了合作社。挑拨山西人河南人关系，挑拨上下级关系，引诱青年跟他学坏……在群众的检举下，他的狐狸尾巴再也掩盖不住了，才谈出他参加李虎领导的“复兴社”，受李虎、李得龙指使，到经济部门来做破坏工作。
    群众从诉苦中，行动中，更进一步的启发了阶级觉悟，同时地主坏蛋的大会坦白，使大家更加明了工厂先后发生的问题，完全是破坏分子捣鬼。从检举坏事中找到坏根。如：（一）打击积极分子：魏守秀、莫正荣工作积极，受到领导上表扬、奖励，申文杰故意在群众中说人家不够格“谁会给领导人舐，就能当模范”。一见谁工作卖力气，他就在一边冷嘲“人家想当积极分哩”！（二）破坏机器修理：如粟永祥对机工高占林说：“你还积极干啥，零件配不上就不用配，你把图样画出来交到工务上，误了事你也不负责任，顺水推舟就是吧，以后有事他们也找不上你”。高占林上了粟永祥的当，机器该检查也不检查了，汽缸没了油，就让它干磨，领下几斤油炒菜吃，零件该修理也不修理。结果跑了车、把牙轮打坏。（三）挑拨干部团结：如申文杰对会计申明理说：“你们山西人吃开啦，杜监理是山西人，山西人都能背枪，河南人算吃不开啦。”企图煸动宗派矛盾。又挑拨杨文生不服从领导。其他如浪费资材等事实还很多。
    三、领导上应注意的两个问题：
    （一）必须贯彻大胆放手的方针，只有相信群众，认真贯彻群众路线的领导方法，才能正确的处理问题。因为工厂的领导干部，大部分缺乏群众工作经验，在运动开始，突破申文杰的政治问题以后，即抛掉绝大多数的职工群众，钻进一个狭小的圈子，单纯进行了两天时间的审讯工作，把讯审中牵涉的嫌疑分子四个人，未经群众了解他们的罪恶事实，即行逮捕扣押，没有得到大部分群众的同情，反而造成了一部分群众的恐怖，领导集团不是相信群众，甚至连自己的党员给被逮捕的人送一条被子，也认为不可靠怀疑起来。把如何发动群众的方针，一时的完全迷惑了。幸而这个湾路时间不长，即经过检讨研究，明确了放手发动群众的方针，又经过学习区党委土改经验基本总结中的放手发动群众，贯彻群众路线的领导方法，根据自己工作上发生的毛病，检讨出领导思想上的病根，主要是不相信群众，不深入群众与不了解群众思想的实际情况。经过学习检讨以后，领导干部即分头参加各组群众的讨论，综合各组讨论情况，来研究群众的思想，接着就组织了一个公审申文杰大会，提出由检举坏事挖坏根，领导上着重掌握了启发群众的阶级觉悟，拿群众自己的诉苦教育群众，拿地主坏蛋的破坏材料教育群众。以后二十天的运动发展，即采取了小组酝酿结合大会斗争的方式，小组酝酿给大会斗争做准备，大会斗争又推动了小组酝酿，更加深入发展，直到群众自己划清了阶级界线和思想界线。
    （二）必须注意掌握阶级政策。检举坏事追挖坏根，一般说容易使斗争对象向群众低头屈服，因为一堆事实，都被群众揭发出来，使他无法巧辩，即便他强词夺理，更易引起群众的仇恨，对他不客气。但领导上应当掌握的是做坏事的“坏根”，一定是群众的阶级敌人，不然就可能追的一塌糊涂，打乱了自己的阶级阵营。因为“先追求破坏事实”这句话阶级性不明确，群众自己阵营中，有些人也有些缺点，对于自己阵营中某些人的缺点，应采取洗脸擦黑教育方针。这次我们从检举中，检举出工会某干部的一些缺点，群众很激愤几乎发展成为一时的主要矛盾，经过领导上研究，才说服群众，转过湾来，把火力集中在地主阶级上面。
