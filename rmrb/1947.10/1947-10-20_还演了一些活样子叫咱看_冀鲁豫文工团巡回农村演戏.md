They Even Acted Out Some Living Examples for Us to See
The Jilu Yu Cultural Troupe's Tour Performances in Rural Areas
Wang Yaping

The comrades of the Jilu Yu Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Cultural Troupe, after listening to the land reform report, participating in the review work in the countryside, and listening to the report of the Border Region's Literary and Art Work Forum, underwent a sudden change in their work style.

The cadres purged the urban viewpoints of performing famous plays and grand operas from their minds.

The composing comrades no longer wanted to perform Beethoven's symphonies but began to collect folk songs and learn to sing ditties.

The scenery comrades no longer insisted on magnificent hard scenery but advocated that a simple curtain could be used to perform for the masses.

The playwright comrades no longer planned to write lengthy dramas of dozens of scenes and several acts but began to write new materials into open-air plays.

The troupe members unanimously shouted: "We want to sing for the masses, we want to perform for the masses!"

In this process of ideological transformation, they put forward the three major slogans of quick writing, quick rehearsal, and quick performance.

The scriptwriters responded to this call and wrote the scripts for "Blood Account of Revenge" and "Protect the Fields, Join the Army." The former script, in two acts, described the insidious and vicious nature of special agent landlords during the review, hiding in air-raid shelters, plotting to harm revolutionary cadres, and finally being discovered by the awakened masses, who defeated this bad landlord. The latter script was a one-act opera depicting the joy of emancipated peasants and their enthusiasm for voluntarily joining the army.

The composers responded to this call and immediately learned the characteristics of Chinese musical instruments from folk artists who played the sheng, plucked the *zhuizi*, and played the yangqin. Furthermore, they absorbed the characteristics of these national musical instruments and folk songs, integrated them with Western music's arrangement methods, and composed the music for "Protect the Fields, Join the Army," also creating more than a dozen new songs. The masses who listened to them all said: "This is truly the flavor of Jilu Yu!"

The troupe members responded to this call and demanded to go to the countryside to tour, perform for the masses, sing, investigate, and help rural drama troupes.

The new direction was determined.

They set off, their destination being the rural areas around Guancheng, Qingfeng, and Nanle. Putting down the hard scenery and cumbersome props, carrying gas lamps and small bags, a light and convenient performing team set out.

To facilitate the work, they were divided into four groups:

1.  Rural Drama Troupe Investigation Group.
2.  Rural Masses Song Teaching Group.
3.  Drama and Song Material Collection Group.
4.  Masses' Feedback Material Collection Group.

They walked more than three hundred *li*, passing through dozens of villages and towns.

They performed for ten days, organized seven evening parties, and had more than 60,000 audience members.

They helped rural drama troupes, collected folk songs, ditties, and some typical characters and stories.

They were warmly welcomed by the masses and also encountered some "soft and hard nails" from certain cadres. When they first arrived in ×× County, an education section cadre said: "Go perform elsewhere, we don't need you here!" They were not discouraged and found the local masses themselves. The troupe members worked with their own hands, carrying wood, building a stage, and mobilizing the village cadres. The performance was put on, changing the cadre's viewpoint, and he asked them to stay and welcomed further performances.

"This time, the old dramas are over. Now the masses have been emancipated. Who still likes mandarin robes and jade belts!"

This was the sincere remark of Li Shouchang, the peasant vice-county head of Guancheng, after watching the performance twice. He immediately notified the drama troupes in each district not to use the old props anymore and to learn from the cultural troupe, adapting and performing realistic rural dramas. He also personally ran to the countryside, notifying the masses, and mobilizing the audience to come and see the new dramas.

A militiaman in a certain district guarding the landlord was careless, not guarding the landlord strictly, not locking the door, not tying up the landlord. After watching how the landlord Jia Xinshan in "Blood Account of Revenge" softened the militiaman guarding him and finally released Jia Xinshan, who then strangled the militiaman to death, the militiaman was very moved. He further realized the insidious and vicious nature of the landlord from his thinking. The next time it was his turn to guard the landlord, he tied up the landlord and locked the door.

At the Qingfeng Fourth District Peasants' Congress, the cultural troupe performed "Lu Dengke," "Model Peasant Household," "Protect the Fields, Join the Army," "Blood Account of Revenge," and other dramas. The enthusiasm of the masses was immediately heightened, and the congress continued for two more days. Some district and village cadres with "it's good enough" mentality, after watching the drama, said: "It's too early! The landlord's things are all hidden in air-raid shelters." Some said: "Can we just watch and not do anything? The landlord has recorded all our debts!" Many lines from the dramas became slogans for the masses at the congress:

"The landlord is really bad, we must tie up the landlord in our village when we go back!"

"We must fight the landlord fiercely, if we are not fierce, we can't find the hidden wealth!"

"Be careful, don't be fooled by the landlord, he has a smile on his face but hides a knife in his belly!"

The general public had very good reactions after watching the performance. These reactions proved that not only were operas popular in the countryside, but also spoken dramas—as long as the content was closely linked to reality, and the characters and stories were familiar to the masses, and could help them solve problems and improve their understanding—were warmly welcomed by the masses. The idea that "spoken dramas are not popular in the countryside" was corrected by this performance.

"I don't understand big operas, but I can understand this very clearly!"

"It's better than spending two hundred yuan to listen to a big opera!"

"I've been selling buns at markets and fairs for fifty years, and I've never heard a drama that suits my taste so well!"

"They not only perform dramas for us to listen to, but also act out some living examples for us to see!"

These were all words spoken from the hearts of the masses after watching the performance; these words proved that the scripts written and performed by the cultural troupe after changing their work style were accepted by the rural masses.

After they returned, the comrades reviewed the work of the tour performance, sorted out the materials, and wrote several more short dramas, preparing to tour in Fan County and Shou Zhang. It is hoped that they will successfully complete their tasks and have a good influence on the rural drama movement! And develop the drama work in Jilu Yu!

### 还演了一些活样子叫咱看　冀鲁豫文工团巡回农村演戏

　　还演了一些活样子叫咱看
  　冀鲁豫文工团巡回农村演戏
    王亚平
    冀鲁豫文联文工团的同志们，听了土改报告，全体下乡参加了复查工作，又听了边区文艺工作座谈会的报告以后，作风突然转变了。
    干部们从思想里掏掉了演名剧、演大戏的城市观点。
    作曲的同志们不再想演奏悲多芬的交响乐，开始搜集民歌，学唱小调。
    布景的同志们，不再坚持要辉煌的硬景，也主张拉一块布幕，就可以向群众出演。
    创作剧本的同志们，不再计划写几十场，几大幕的长剧，开始把新材料写成广场剧。
    团员们，一致喊着：“咱们要给群众唱歌，要给群众演戏！”
    在这样思想转变过程里，他们提出了快写、快排、快演的三大号召。
    写剧的响应了这个号召，写出了“变天帐”“保田参军”两个剧本。前一个剧本，分两幕，写出复查中特务地主的阴险、毒辣、暗藏在防空洞里，布置残害革命干部的勾当，终被觉悟的群众发现了，打垮了这个坏地主。后一个剧本，是一个独幕歌剧，写出翻身农民的喜悦，自动参军的热情。
    作曲的响应了这个号召，马上向吹笙的、拉坠子的、打洋琴的民间艺人学习中国乐器的特点，进一步，吸收了这些国乐的特点，民歌的特点，融汇了西乐的配曲法，配成了“保田参军”的曲子，还作了十几首新歌，群众听了都说：“这才是冀鲁豫风味的歌哩！”
    团员们响应了这个号召，要求下乡去巡回向群众演戏、唱歌、调查，帮助农村剧团。
    新方向确定了。
    出发了，目的地是观城、清丰、南乐一带的农村。放下硬景，笨重的导具，扛起汽灯，背起小包袱，一个轻便的演剧队出征了。
    为了便于进行工作，分成了四组：
    １、农村剧团调查组。
    ２、农村群众教歌组。
    ３、剧歌材料收集组。
    ４、群众反映材料收集组。
    他们步行了三百多里路，经过了几十个村镇。
    他们演出了十天，组成了七个晚会，观众有六万多人。
    他们帮助了农村剧团，收集了民歌、小调、和一些典型的人物、故事。
    他们受到群众热烈的欢迎，也碰了某些干部的软硬钉子。先到××县，教育科的一个干部说：“你们到别处演吧，俺这里不需要！”他们并不灰心，自己找地方群众，团员自己动手，抬木头，搭舞台，向村干部动员，戏演出了，改变了干部的观点，又留着欢迎续演。
    “这一家伙，旧戏算完了，现在群众翻身了，谁还喜欢蟒袍玉带啊！”
    这是观城的农民副县长李守诚看了两次演出之后说的真心话，他马上通知各区剧团，不准再打旧箱，一律向文工团学习，编演现实的农村剧。他还亲自跑到乡下，通知群众，动员观众来看新戏。
    某区看守地主的民兵，吊二郎当，对地主看守不严，门不锁，地主不拴起来，等到看了“变天帐”里的地主贾心善如何软化看守他的民兵，最后放开了贾心善，他就把那个民兵用绳子勒死了。民兵看到这一节很受感动，从思想里进一步认识到地主的阴险，毒辣，再轮到他看守地主的时候，就把地主捆起来，把门上了锁。
    在清丰四区农民大会上，文工团演出了“吕登科”“模范农家”“保田参军”“变天帐”等剧，群众情绪立刻提高了，大会多继续了两天。有一些“差不多”思想的区村干部看过戏之后，就说：“早着哩！地主的东西都钻到防空洞里去了。”有的说：“看看不干能中不？地主把咱的帐都记上了！”好多剧词，都变成大会群众的口号：
    “地主真不好，回去非把咱庄上的地主捆起来不中！”
    “斗地主要狠，不狠浮财找不出！”
    “小心，不要上地主的当，他是脸上笑，肚里藏着刀子！”
    一般的群众看了演出的戏，都有很好的反映。从这些反映里，证明了不只歌剧在农村里吃得开，话剧，——只要是内容和现实结合的紧，演出的人物、故事是群众熟悉的，能够帮助他们解决问题，提高认识的，也都被群众热烈的欢迎。“话剧在农村吃不开”的观念被这次演出给纠正了。
    “听大戏不懂，这听的多真切！”
    “比花二百元听大戏还强哩！”
    “我卖包子赶集、赶会五十年了，还没听过这么合脾味的戏哩！”
    “不光演戏叫咱听，还演了一些活样子叫咱看！”
    这都是群众看了演出的戏，从心里说出的话；这些话证明了文工团转变作风后，写出来演出来的剧本，是被农村的群众接受了。
    他们回来以后，同志们检讨了巡回演出的工作，整理了材料，又写出了几个短剧，准备到范县、寿张一带巡回演出，希望他们胜利的完成任务，给农村戏剧运动起一些好影响！把冀鲁豫的戏剧工作开展起来！
