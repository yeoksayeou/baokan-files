　　Taihang Third Subdistrict Organizes Experiences in Financial Work
　　I. Launch a conscious financial rectification movement among cadres and the masses, with everyone finding, rectifying, and managing together.
　　After the land reform, based on their desire to prosper, the masses were willing to organize scattered and unused items to reduce the burden and support the war. For example, the masses said, "Organizing finances benefits everyone, supporting the war defeats Chiang Kai-shek," and some said, "Organizing finances is a good thing." At the same time, cadres also demanded that village financial expenditures be resolved to benefit the masses. However, at the beginning of the rectification, many cadres and masses had concerns and passive thoughts. Some thought there was nothing to rectify, those who had personal involvement were afraid of being struggled against if they spoke out, or of losing face if they had to pay compensation, cadres were afraid of being accused of corruption, some had feudal superstitious thoughts of "not daring to use sacred objects," others had the idea that if things were rectified, the higher authorities would requisition them, "so it's better not to rectify," and some had departmentalist ideas of systems each setting up their own shop, some did not focus on production and construction... and other ideological problems.
　　How to inspire the enthusiasm and consciousness of cadres and the masses?
　　(1) Use accounting methods to calculate the burden, the family property, and the war consumption, so that the masses recognize the difficulties and consciously manage and report themselves. After Beishe in Pingshun calculated the accounts, the masses proposed, "Organize one more share of public property, and pay one less share of burden," and reported themselves one after another, rectifying materials worth 1,030,000 yuan in three days. (2) Take the newly emancipated poor peasants and hired laborers as the backbone to lead the masses to work together. Xihuangxu, Dongguan in Licheng, and Zhangjing in Pingshun all have this experience. (3) After preliminary rectification, a public property exhibition can be held to make the masses realize that accumulation makes a big difference, and use actual benefits to increase everyone's enthusiasm and break the idea of "there is nothing to rectify." For example, after Gucun in Huguan exhibited public property worth 700,000 yuan, everyone's enthusiasm was even higher, and they automatically proposed to rectify for another five days, resulting in more than 1.2 million yuan. Side in Licheng put forward slogans such as "Poor villages have no poor cooperatives!" and "One person left behind is useless, concentrated together they are very useful," to encourage and educate the masses. (4) Conduct interviews and investigations among villagers who were village chiefs, deputies, regiment leaders, cooperative leaders and elders before the war, and report themselves and each other. Pingshun has achieved great results using this method. (5) Introduce typical villages that are self-sufficient in production to promote and encourage general villages to carry out rectification.
　　II. Launch commendation and model activities, calling on cadres and the masses to perform meritorious services for the people in financial rectification, and record and commend meritorious services immediately to promote consciousness. Inspiring cadres to consciously report is by no means anti-corruption or tracing old roots, and the masses should be relieved of their worries. For example, Dajing Village announced the results of the rectification and posted commendation lists to compare merits, promoting competition between sub-districts, and requested a re-examination for another three days.
　　III. The rectification of village finance must be a unified action combining top-down and bottom-up approaches, with top-down deployment and bottom-up mobilization. Management must also be a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, with equal emphasis on production and economy. There must be unified regulations and systems from top to bottom, as well as mass supervision, management, and review from bottom to top. All unnecessary expenditures must be strictly stopped (especially within the village). However, the management organization must be democratically elected and unifiedly led.
　　IV. Financial rectification is a long-term construction undertaking for the masses, and it is impossible to achieve thoroughness all at once. For example, Shangcun in Lucheng has rectified three times in the past year and this spring, and each time there was something to be found, which is proof. In addition, in the past, our financial rectification was based solely on solving difficulties or a task-oriented perspective. We must recognize that organizing finances is the starting point for establishing revolutionary housekeeping and people's finance, and it is a solid material source for supporting long-term war in the future. For example, the masses in Licheng proposed, "One village plants a money tree!" This shows that organizing finances is a part of production and construction.
　　In the management and investment direction of village finance, appropriate profits should be obtained from supporting mass production, and speculation and the grabbing style should be strictly prevented. For example, Licheng proposed to rely on mountains to eat mountains, rely on water to eat water, and rely on roads to eat roads. Lucheng achieved the goal of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both the public and private sectors by investing in production in workshops, coal kilns, and straw hat villages.
　　V. Organizing finance must be closely combined with eliminating feudalism and superstition. The masses must be educated to establish the idea of being masters of their own affairs and managing their own finances after the peasants have turned over. The masses must recognize that temple properties, cooperative properties, clan properties, public trees, especially old opera costumes, are the legacy of exploitation and rule by the feudal landlord class, and should be organized to turn useless things into useful capital. For example, in Wangjia and Nanshan in Lucheng, the masses were originally unwilling to hand over cooperative property to public property. After many debates, they realized that it was a feudal relic, and the masses consciously took out the things from the five cooperatives, breaking feudal superstitious ideas.
　　VI. The finances of the border, county, and village levels can be managed in a "one pot" manner, because the finances of the three levels are basically in the village, but after they are organized, they must be strictly separated and cannot be misappropriated or annexed by each other.

### 太行三分区整理财政工作经验

　　太行三分区整理财政工作经验
    一、发动干部群众自觉整财运动，大家找、大家整、大家管。
    土地改革以后，群众基于发家要求愿意把失散失用的东西整理起来，减轻负担支援战争。如群众说：“整理财政人人沾光，支援战争打垮老蒋”，有的说：“整理财政是件好事情。”同时干部也要求解决村财政的开支，给群众谋利益。但是在开始整理时，干部群众也有不少人则存在顾虑与消极思想，有的以为没啥可整，与个人有牵连的怕说出来挨斗争，或赔偿怕丢人，干部怕反贪污，有的存在“不敢动用神物”的封建迷信思想，也有怕整出来上级调用“不如不整”的思想，还有部分系统各立门户的本位思想，有的不从生产建设着眼……等思想问题。
    如何启发干部和群众的积极性和自觉性呢？
    （一）用算帐办法算负担，算家当，算战争消耗，使群众认识困难，自觉管理进行自报，平顺北社经过算帐，群众提出：“多整一分公产，少出一分负担”，纷纷自报，三天内整出物资可折款一百○三万元。（二）以新翻身的贫佃雇为骨干，带领群众大家动手。黎城西黄须、东关、平顺张井，都有这样经验。（三）初步整理后，可进行公产展览，使群众认识积少成多，以实际利益提高大家的积极性，打破“无啥可整”的思想。如壶关固村展览过价值七十万元的公产后，大家情绪更高，自动提出再整五天，结果整出一百二十多万元。黎城寺底提出：“有穷村没穷社”和“一人留下不顶事，集中起来顶大用，”等口号，鼓励教育群众。（四）在战前当过村长、副、团长，社首及老人中间进行访问，调查，自报互报，平顺用这种办法收效很大。（五）介绍生产自给的典型村，推动鼓舞一般村进行整理。
    二、开展表功表模，号召干群在整理财政中为民立功，有功即记即表，以促进自觉。启发干部自觉报出，绝非反贪污、追老根，对群众则解除其顾虑。如大井村公布整理成绩，又表功贴榜比功劳，推动小区与小区相互竞赛，又要求再复查三天。
    三、村财政的整理必须是上下结合，双管齐下，由上布置，由下发动的一致行动，在管理上也必须是上下结合，应以生产节约并重，既须自上而下的统一规定制度，又须自下而上的群众监督管理审查，一切不必须的开支必须严格停止。（尤其在村内）但管理组织中必须是民主产生，统一领导。
    四、整顿财政是群众的长期建设事业，不能企图一下子搞的彻底。如潞城上村在去年今春连整三次，每次都有东西，就是明证。另外过去我们对整顿财政，曾存在着单纯从解决困难出发，或任务观点，必须认识整理财政是建立革命家务和人民财政的起点，是今后支持长期战争的雄厚的物质源泉。如黎城群众提出：“一村栽活一棵摇钱树！”这说明整理财政是生产建设组成的一部分。
    在村财政的管理投资方向上，应从扶植群众生产中获得适当利润，严防投机，抓一把的作风，如黎城提出靠山吃山，靠水吃水，靠路吃路。潞城在作坊、煤窑、草帽庄投资生产中，达到了公私兼顾，公私两利的目的。
    五、整理财政与查封建反迷信密切结合，必须教育群众，树立农民翻身后自己管家自己理财的主人翁思想，使群众认识庙产、社产、族产公树尤其是旧戏衣，是封建地主阶级剥削统治的遗留财产，应加整理，把无用东西，变为有用资本，如潞城王家、南山，原来群众不愿把社物归公产，后经多次争论，认识了是封建遗物，群众把大小五个社的东西，都自觉的拿出来了，打破了封建迷信思想。
    六、边、县、村三级财政，可以用一锅煮的方式管理，因为三级财政，基本都在庄，但在整理出来以后，必须严格分开，不能互相挪用与并吞。（三专署初步总结）
