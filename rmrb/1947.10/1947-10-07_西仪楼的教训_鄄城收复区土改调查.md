The Lessons of Xiyi Tower
An Investigation of Land Reform in the Recovered Area of Juancheng
Peng Cheng

After our army recovered Xiyi Tower in the Fifth District of Juancheng, comrades from the work team conducted a survey in the village. In the three months of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, a total of eight cadres and civilians were murdered. Their class composition was: six poor peasants, two middle peasants; of these, three were surnamed Yi, and five were outsiders. Economic situation: The whole village had 165 households, 750 people, 30.8526 hectares of land, 819 rooms, and 91 head of livestock. There were 21 landlord households: before land reform, each person averaged 0.6 hectares of land, 2.33 rooms, and 0.14 head of livestock; after land reform, each person averaged 0.23 hectares, 0.85 rooms, and 0.038 head of livestock; after enemy rule, each person increased to 0.73 hectares of land, 1.79 rooms, and 0.2 head of livestock. There were 16 rich peasant households: each person averaged 0.42 hectares of land, 1.27 rooms, and 0.22 head of livestock; after land reform, each person averaged 0.21 hectares, 0.98 rooms, and 0.19 head of livestock; after enemy rule, each person averaged 0.4 hectares of land, 1.24 rooms, and 0.29 head of livestock. There were 60 middle peasant households: before land reform, each person averaged 0.25 hectares of land, 1.11 rooms, and 0.16 head of livestock; after land reform, each person averaged 0.27 hectares, 1.2 rooms, and 0.15 head of livestock; during the enemy rule period, each person averaged 0.26 hectares of land, 1.1 rooms, and 0.14 head of livestock. There were 49 poor peasant households: before land reform, each person averaged 0.13 hectares of land, 0.64 rooms, and 0.03 head of livestock; after land reform, each person averaged 0.21 hectares of land, 0.72 rooms, and 0.08 head of livestock; after enemy rule, each person averaged 0.09 hectares of land, 0.64 rooms, and 0.05 head of livestock. There were 19 extremely poor households: before land reform, each person averaged 0.07 hectares of land, 0.17 rooms, and 0.005 head of livestock; after land reform, each person averaged 0.21 hectares of land, 0.47 rooms, and 0.04 head of livestock; after enemy rule, each person averaged 0.03 hectares of land, 0.17 rooms, and 0.01 head of livestock.
    From the above figures, we have learned several things:
    First, the stubbornness and viciousness of the landlords' reaction. In the three months of enemy rule, with the exception of a few industrial and commercial landlords who fled to Hebei and did not reverse grain distribution, other landlords universally carried out the reversal of grain, land, alteration of criticism labels, and pursuit of gains. After land reform, the average land per landlord was 0.23 hectares, which immediately increased to 0.73 hectares under enemy rule, a two-and-a-half-fold increase, even exceeding the pre-land reform average of 0.6 hectares per person. During the land reform, the big landlord Yi Honglu was considered enlightened and progressive at the time, but this time he reversed the most grain and land. Before land reform, he had 4.78 hectares of land, and after land reform, he was left with 1.87 hectares; this time, he reversed up to 20 hectares, reversing the land that was taken from him after the War of Resistance, the land he sold, and even the land for which he personally collected money, forcing Liu Qingcai's wife to death for silver dollars. The landlord Yang Yongchun (father of the puppet township chief) said: "Since the War of Resistance, the things of the poor, whether obtained through struggle or earned through labor, will all be reversed." The hideous face of this landlord is completely exposed to the peasants. The methods are also extremely cruel and vicious. In addition, of the eight people who were murdered, six were extremely poor and poor peasants, and five were outsiders, with Yi Taishan being a single household. This shows that the landlords are targeting the extremely poor peasants and the outsider single households.
    Second, the extremely poor and poor peasants suffered the most, and we should resolutely mobilize the extremely poor peasants as the backbone of the revenge land reform movement. From the above figures, it can be seen that when the enemy arrived, the extremely poor peasants had even less land than before the land reform. Of the 19 extremely poor households in the village, 11 had everything reversed, and 10 even lost the land they had in the past. At the same time, six of the eight murdered mass cadres were extremely poor and poor peasants, accounting for 75% of the total. From these comparisons, we can clearly see that all kinds of disasters, such as reversing grain and land, beatings, shootings, and live burials, fall on the poor and extremely poor. We should closely combine their demands and resolutely mobilize them as the backbone of the movement. Any neglect of the demands and practices of the extremely poor peasants is wrong.
    Third, we should unite with the middle peasants and unify our strength to form a movement to struggle against the landlords. First, from the village's population perspective, there are a total of 165 households in the village. In action, if we abandon the 38% of the middle peasant population and use the 36% of the poor peasant population to struggle against the 26% of the landlord and rich peasant population, it will be impossible to achieve complete victory. Therefore, the middle peasants, who account for 38% of the population, should be well united to launch a struggle against the landlords. Furthermore, observing from the demands of the middle peasants, during the landlords' universal reversal of accounts, 15 out of 60 middle peasant households were reversed, accounting for 25% of their total, with the average land per person decreasing from 0.27 hectares to 0.26 hectares. In terms of murdered people, two of the eight were middle peasants, also accounting for 25% of the total number of victims. From these figures, it can be proven that we should unite with the middle peasants and that it is possible to unite with the middle peasants to jointly take action to struggle against the landlords.
    Fourth, the land reform in this village is a middle peasant ideology and a rich peasant line, not a genuine mass line. From the figures after the land reform, whether in terms of land or housing, the rich peasants always occupied the highest amount, followed by the middle peasants, and the extremely poor peasants had the least. The past land reform in this village reflected the leading ideology of the middle peasants, without establishing the leadership of the poor peasants, so it was very incomplete, the work was not energetic, it was a rich peasant line and not a genuine mass line, which therefore affected the development of guerrilla warfare after the fall of the area.

　　西仪楼的教训
  　鄄城收复区土改调查
    彭诚
    我军收复鄄城五区西仪楼后，工作组同志在该村作了一个调查。在蒋军统治的三个月内，残害了干部群众共八名，成份是：赤贫农占六名，中农二名；其中姓仪的三名，外姓外来户五名。经济情况：全村一百六十五户，人七百五十口，地三十顷八十五亩二分六厘，房八百一十九间，牲口九十一头。地主二十一户：土改前，每人平均地九亩。房二．三三间，牲口○．一四头；土改后，每人平均三．四五亩，房○．八五间；牲口○．○三八头；敌统治后，每人增到地十一亩，房一．七九间，牲口○．二头。富农十六户：每人平均地六．二八亩，房一．二七间，牲口．二二头；土改后，每人平均三．一亩，房○．九八间，牲口○．一九头；敌统治后，每人平均地六．○四亩，房一．二四间，牲口○．二九头。中农六十户：土改前，每人平均地三．七九亩，房一．一一间，牲口○．一六头；土改后，每人平均四．○二亩，房子一．二间，牲口○．一五头；敌统治时期，每人平均地三．九六亩，房一．一间，牲口○．一四头。贫农四十九户：土改前，每人平均地一．九四亩，房○．六四间，牲口○．○三头；土改后，每人平均地三．二一亩，房○．七二间，牲口○．○八头；敌统治后，每人平均土地一．四亩，房○．六四间，牲口○．○五头。赤贫十九户：土改前，每人平均地一．一一亩，房○．一七间，牲口○．○○五头；土改后，每人平均地三．一三亩，房○．四七间，牲口○．○四头；敌统治后，每人平均地○．四亩，房○．一七间，牲口○．○一头。
    从以上的数目字中，我们体验到几点：
    第一、地主的反动顽强与毒辣。在敌人统治的三个月中，此村除少数工属地主逃往河北未进行倒粮外，其他地主都普遍进行了倒粮、倒地、改批头、追果实。土改后，地主每人平均土地三．四五亩，敌统治后马上增到每人一一亩，计有两倍半，亦超过土改前每人平均地亩数九亩。在土改中，大地主仪洪陆，当时大家认为他很开明进步，但这次他倒粮、地最厉害。土改前他有地七一．七亩，土改后给他留地二八亩，这次他倒到三○○亩，把抗战以后斗走他的地，他卖的地，连他亲手收钱当的地也倒回去，逼银元逼死刘庆财老婆。地主杨永春（伪乡长的父亲）这样说：“自抗战以后，穷人东西无论是斗争分的也好，出力挣的也好，都一律倒回来。”此地主的狰狞面孔，完全暴露在农民的面前。手段又是十分凶狠而毒辣。另外被残害的八人中，六人是赤贫、贫农，五个是外姓的，伊太山是个独门。这可以说明地主是针对赤贫农开刀，对着外来户独门开。
    第二、赤贫、贫农受害最大，应坚决发动赤贫农作为复仇土改运动的骨干。由上面数字中看出，敌人到来时，赤贫农土地等比土改前还少，全村十九户赤贫，有十一户被倒的净光，有十户连自己过去的地都赔了进去，同时被害的群众干部八人中，六人是赤贫贫农，占总数的百分之七十五。从这些比较当中，我们可以明显的看出：倒粮、倒地、挨打、枪杀、活埋种种灾难，都落在贫农赤贫身上，我们应紧紧结合他们的要求，坚决把他们发动起来，作为运动的骨干，任何忽视赤贫农要求与作法，都是不对的。
    第三、应当联合中农，统一力量形成运动，向地主斗争。首先从一村户口上来看，此村共有一六五户，在行动中，我们如果抛弃了百分之三十八的中农人口，以贫农百分之卅六的人口，向百分之二十六的地主富农人口作斗争，就不可能完全胜利。所以这占人口百分之三十八的中农，应很好联合向地主展开斗争。再从中农要求上来观察，在地主普遍进行倒算时，六十户中农有十五户被倒算，占其总数百分之二十五，每人地亩平均数目四．○二亩，降到三．九六亩。在被害人口上来看，八人中有两人是中农，也占其被害总数百分之二十五。从以上这些数字中可以证明，我们应当联合中农，而且可能联合中农共同行动向地主斗争。
    第四、此村土改是中农思想富农路线，不是真正的群众路线。从土改后的数字看，无论是土地、房屋，富农总占最高数，中农次之，赤贫农最少。此村过去的土改，反映了中农的领导思想，没有树立贫农领导，故很不彻底，工作不起劲，是富农路线而不是真正群众路线，因此也就影响沦陷后游击战争的开展。
