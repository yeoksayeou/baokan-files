　　Jilu and Yu Folk Art Propaganda Team
  　Long-Distance Tour Performances
  　Deeply Promoting the Counter-Offensive
    [Our Newspaper, Jilu and Yu, 23rd Dispatch] The Jilu and Yu Folk Art Propaganda Team, a group of over a hundred people, in response to the call of the Central Bureau's Propaganda Department to strengthen the propaganda for the great counter-offensive, conducted its first 400-li long-distance tour performance. Wherever they went, they were met by huge crowds and warmly welcomed and cared for by local military and government organs and the masses. Their printed five-color portraits of Chairman Mao and songbooks were in great demand. The artist comrades were hardworking and proactive in their work and actions, consciously learning from the masses and training themselves. The team's organization included an armed squad, a book and newspaper squad, and a transportation squad, and was further divided into two smaller teams. The first team included a sheng and flute music class, a flute and yangqin class, a women's storytelling class, and an opera a cappella class; the second team included a new slide show class, a magic class, a shadow puppet show class, a circus class, a painting and sculpture class, and a carving and printing class, all of which were well-received by the broad masses in rural areas. These large and small miscellaneous drama organizations have all been updated with new content, changing the old ways of the past and becoming the spiritual food urgently needed by the liberated peasants. The masses saw the new artists' attitude towards life and learning, and their dedication to their work. They did not relax their studies during marches, and completely eliminated the old artists' sloppy habits. The song of "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" spread everywhere with them, and they initiated competitions with each other to see who performed it best, and therefore gained the respect of the masses in abiding by mass discipline. Along the way, they conducted continuous propaganda for six days, held ten large and small meetings, propagated to approximately 19,300 people, and used gaps in action to carry out convenient forms of propaganda and distribute propaganda materials, broadcast victory news, and the newly established book and newspaper class sold drum lyrics, pendants, new land, and popular opera collections published by the Jilu and Yu Bookstore. Portraits of Chairman Mao, etc. They passed through the counties of Nanfeng, Yuanchao, Guantao, and Guangping.
    [Another Dispatch] The Tai Xi Public School organized a propaganda team of nearly a hundred people, divided into slogan, cartoon, living film, and speech groups. To attract the audience, the students dressed up as all kinds of characters, some playing the four major families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen in the KMT-controlled areas, and others playing liberated peasants in the liberated areas. During the speeches, these costumed characters were used as examples, which was very welcomed by the masses. They propagated for a total of four days, passing through more than thirty villages, and about fifteen thousand people heard their propaganda.
