    Huocun and Nantianhe Combine Autumn Plowing and Autumn Stockpiling Well
    Women Grind Rice for Counter-Attack Meticulously
    Men and Livestock Hurry to Turn the Soil
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] In Huocun, Fourth District, under the active leadership and promotion of Branch Secretary Comrade Yan Guize and Labor Hero Fang Miniu, the problem of relying on livestock and the idea of idleness was resolved. A system of using materials according to their aptitude and division of labor was implemented, and the movement of "men plowing the land, women grinding rice, and all livestock plowing the fields" was launched again.
    The autumn harvest was completed on the 18th of this month. After checking the autumn plowing, although the whole village had turned 129 mu of soil during the autumn harvest, Fang Miniu's team alone accounted for 63 mu, while Chang Erhai's group had only turned over 3 mu. Upon inspection in the fields, it was found that several teams of livestock were turning the soil, while the rest of the people were groping around in the fields, seemingly not in a hurry. Immediately, a meeting of cadres, group leaders, and male and female activists was convened at night to ask, "When can it be completed?" Each group was asked to calculate, and after calculating back and forth, they only considered the livestock and not the manpower. The result of the calculation was ten days. At that time, the leaders also raised the question: "Can livestock turn the soil by themselves?" Wang Zhenyou said: "People can only dig stubble, pull hemp, and thresh!" The village chief's wife said: "Our women still have to thresh beans, thresh hemp, and grind two meals' worth of food!" In short, only livestock could be used, and people could not dig the ground. Wang Heidan also proposed: "We still have to hand in public grain! We also have to grind rice?" At this time, everyone seemed to think that it would take half a month, or even have to take out livestock to grind rice. Later, starting from Fang Miniu's team, there were a total of 323 mu of land, 106.9 mu of wheat had been planted, 63 mu of autumn land had been turned, leaving 153.1 mu of stubble land. There were five strong and weak livestock, averaging 15 mu of land turned per day. There were fifteen male full laborers, with five using plows, leaving ten. On average, one person could dig 0.7 mu per day. Men and livestock could turn at least 22 mu of land per day, and 154 mu of land could be turned in seven days. There were also two male semi-laborers, ten female full laborers, and four semi-laborers in the group. After further planning, the livestock would not plow in the afternoon, and would help with threshing with the five male full laborers. The two male semi-laborers and two women could dig stubble, five women could grind public grain, and the rest could take turns doing household chores, delivering public grain while plowing. It was estimated that it could be completed in seven days. When asked if the women could do it, they all agreed: "It can be done." After this calculation, other groups also calculated precisely, reducing the time. Chang Erhai proposed that it could be done in six days. Everyone said: "This division of labor can save labor!" Finally, the millstones for grinding public grain were distributed according to the group. Everyone agreed: "The division of labor should be rigid, and housework should be flexible," "Put down the rake, pick up the broom," and re-stipulated the living standards for calculating work points. The village office sewed a flag, bought three towels, two bars of soap, and a pack of needles, and hung them in front of the cooperative. Whoever finished first would win it. Everyone was in high spirits. Fang Miniu's team had turned half of the land and ground a quarter of the public grain.

    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] On the night of the fourth day of the ninth lunar month, Cao Linshui, a model party member of Nantianhe in the Second District, convened a mass meeting to discuss how to combine plowing and grinding public grain to ensure that neither was neglected. Everyone immediately started a heated discussion. Wang Qihao said: "If we want to combine autumn plowing and autumn stockpiling well, we can organize all the full and semi-labor women. Our brigade has seven female full laborers and twelve semi-laborers who are responsible for grinding rice, while the male laborers and livestock plow the land." Niu Haixiang said: "Our group has nine women, and we must organize them to grind rice and not delay the men in digging the land." A suitable equivalent value was also discussed, and the slogan was "Combine autumn plowing and autumn stockpiling well, men and women, old and young, get up early, men dig the land and livestock plow, women organize to grind fine rice, ensure the autumn plowing is completed in five days, women strive for one day earlier, and ensure that it is done cleanly, thoroughly, and quickly!" After the meeting, the next day, Linshui's mother called the women of his team to grind grain in the middle of the night. Three women pushed, two young girls pulled, and two old ladies collected rice and ground rice. They ground one stone of grain before dawn. Linshui, Qihao, and other activists also gathered on the land, with a total of 20 full laborers, 12 semi-laborers, and 6 children. They dug 102 mu of land before dawn, and a total of 30 mu by noon. Old women on the street were saying, "Now things are better, our village's public grain is not much, this little grain would not have been enough for the old landlord to eat in the temple in the old society." Zhonglin's mother said: "It's not even as much as the security team wanted, we must grind it well and finer." That night, cadres, activists, and group leaders summarized three days of work. Linshui's brigade dug 65 mu of land, plowed 78 mu, and the 23 women ground 10 stone of grain. The whole village dug a total of 263 mu of land, plowed 147 mu, and the women ground 26 stone and 5 dou of grain. Each group also made a plan for the next three days and continued to carry out the autumn plowing and autumn stockpiling red flag competition.

    霍村、南天河秋耕秋屯结合好
    妇女细碾反攻米
    男人牲口赶垡地
    【本报长治讯】四区霍村的秋耕，在支部书记阎贵则同志，及劳动英雄方米牛积极领导与推动下，解决了靠牲口消停思想，实行了按材使用分工，再度掀起了“男刨地、女碾米，全部牲口把地犁”的运动。
    本月十八号收秋已经完毕，检查了一下秋耕，虽然全村在收秋中垡地一百二十九亩，可是方米牛一个队即占了六十三亩，常二孩组仅垡地三亩多。到地里检查，都是几犋牲口垡地，其余的人都在场里摸索，好象不发急的样子。随即黑夜召开干部组长及男女积极分子会议，提出“啥时可以完成”？让各组计算，算过去，算过来，都是只算牲口不算人力，算的结果是十天。当时领导上又提出：“就是牲口能垡地吗？”问题出来了。王振有说：“人只能刨茬，拨麻，打打场！”村长老婆说：“咱们妇女还要打豆子，打麻，碾上二顿吃的！”总之，只能用牲口，人就不能刨地。王黑蛋又提出：“咱们还要交公粮呀！还得碾米？”这时大家好象认为就得半月，甚至还得抽出牲口去碾米。后从方米牛一队算起，共地三百二十三亩，已种麦一百零六亩九分，已垡过秋地六十三亩，净留茬地一百五十三亩一分；好坏牲口五犋，一天平均垡地十五亩；男全劳力十五个，用五个掌犁，尚有十个，一天一人平均刨七分，人牲口一天最少可能垡地二十二亩，七天就垡地一百五十四亩，组内有两个男半劳力，十个妇女全劳力，四个半劳力，又计划一番，牲口下午不犁地，和五个男全劳力帮打场，二个男半劳力和二个妇女可以刨茬子，五个妇女碾公粮，其余的轮流做家庭零碎生活，耕地带送公粮，怎样七天也可完成。问了下妇女是否可以，一致认为：“能行。”这样一算，其他组也精确算了下，减少了时间。常二孩提出，六天就可以，大家都说：“这样分工就能省工！”最后碾公粮的碾子，按组进行了分配，一致提出：“分工要死，做生活要活”，“放了筢子，拿扫帚。”，并重新规定了折工计工的生活标准，村公所缝了一杆旗子，买了三条手巾，二块肥皂，一包针，挂到合作社门前，谁先完，谁夺取，大家情绪很高，方米牛组垡地已达半数，碾出公粮四分之一。

    【本报长治讯】二区南天河模范党员曹林水阴历九月初四日黑夜召开群众大会，讨论耕地碾公粮如何结合，做到两不误，大家随即热烈的吵开，王起好说：“要想秋耕秋屯结合好，可把妇女全半劳力组织起来，我大队有了七个女全劳力，十二个半劳力，负责碾米，男劳力牲口犁地。”牛海香说：“我组有九个妇女，一定组织起来碾米，不误男人掘地。”并讨论出适当的等价，口号是“秋耕秋屯结合好，男女老幼比起早，男人掘地牲口犁，妇女组织碾细米，保证秋耕五天完，妇女争取早一天，保证做到一干二净三快！”散会后第二日，半夜林水娘就把他分队的妇女叫起来碾谷，三个妇女推，两个小女拉，两个老太太收米碾米，不到明就碾了一石谷。林水、起好等积极分子也集合上地，共全劳力廿个，半劳力十二个，儿童六个，不明就掘地一百零二亩，赶晌午共掘了卅亩。街上老太婆嚷嚷的说：“现在可是好过啦，咱村公粮出的可不多，这点粮要在旧社会还不够老社头在庙里吃哩。”中林娘说：“还没保安队要的零头多哩，咱可要碾好碾细些。”黑夜干部积极分子各组长总结三天工作，林水大队三天掘地六十五亩，犁地七十八亩，妇女二十三个，碾谷十石。全村三天共掘地二百六十三亩，犁地一百四十七亩，妇女碾谷二十六石五斗，各组并订出后三天的计划，继续开展了秋耕秋屯夺红旗运动。            （生秀、南天河通讯组）
