The international situation is becoming more favorable to the people.
  The World Peace and Democracy United Front is accelerating its formation, and mass movements against warmongers are flourishing.

The United Nations General Assembly has been in session for three weeks and is still in intense debate. Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky held an important press conference, continuing to expose American war provocateurs with conclusive evidence, reiterating the Soviet Union's firm stance in defending peace, defending the United Nations, and opposing new war instigators; and expressing full confidence in the people's democratic forces. Vyshinsky's two righteous and stern speeches, and the Soviet delegation's firm attitude at the General Assembly, have won the response and support of democratic leaders, progressive figures, and the broad masses of people in various countries. A mass movement spanning Europe and the Americas to defend peace, maintain the United Nations, and oppose new war provocateurs is emerging. Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito has issued a call to unite all progressive people in the world to fight for peace. British Labour Party left-winger Zilliacus criticized America's imperialist policies and stated definitively that instigating a new war is impossible. He pointed out: "The British working class does not want to fight the Soviet Union, and two-thirds of the British people want to establish closer relations with the Soviet Union." Latin American countries have also criticized the United States' reactionary stance in the United Nations. In the United States, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the American Women's Assembly, and many progressive figures, scholars, and scientists have unanimously demanded that American foreign policy "cooperate with other countries" and "be directed towards peace." Former US Vice President Wallace has even called on the American people to form a "well-organized resistance movement to force the Truman administration and Congress to change their current war-oriented policies." He also stated definitively: "No country in Europe wants to fight or is preparing for war."

The crisis in Western Europe has continued to deepen this week. In order to alleviate popular discontent and save the deep economic crisis, the British cabinet has implemented a partial "reshuffle," but under the circumstances that the British authorities continue to pursue their policy of relying on the United States externally and following the lead of big capitalists internally, it is completely impossible to solve or even alleviate the extent of their economic crisis. The accelerated deterioration of France's economic situation has led the French Foreign Ministry spokesman to lament: "If foreign aid cannot be obtained in October, the entire future of France's economic recovery will be in danger; even if aid is obtained in November or December, it will be too late." The Gasperi government in Italy is tottering under the impact of wave after wave of strikes. From the great debate on the no-confidence motion in the Italian parliament, one can see how fragile Gasperi's political foundation has become. At present, the reactionary authorities in Britain, France, and Italy have pinned all their hopes for saving the crisis on the assistance of American loans, but the fruitless adjournment of the "Emergency Aid to Europe Conference" held at the White House has not only made the prospects of this hope of the reactionary factions in Britain, France, and Italy even dimmer, but also confirmed that the United States is unable and unlikely to save the crisis in Western Europe.

Another important event this week was the convening and victorious opening of the Second National Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the party of the German working class, and the complete consistency of party principles demonstrated in the debate, which embodies the consolidation and unity of the German working class. The congress specifically raised the issue of the party's attitude towards peasants, and determined to establish a united front of working people in towns and villages, which will play an important role in the unity of German workers and peasants. In the year and a half since its establishment, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has increased its membership by 38 percent, now reaching 1.9 million (excluding the 324,000 Communist Party members in the western occupation zones), of which workers account for 48 percent, which again shows the unprecedented improvement in the level of consciousness of the German working class. This is a major factor in the democratic forces in Europe. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 国际形势更对人民有利　世界和平民主统一战线正加速形成反对战争贩子的群众运动蓬勃兴起

　　国际形势更对人民有利
  　世界和平民主统一战线正加速形成反对战争贩子的群众运动蓬勃兴起
    联大开会已三周，迄今仍在激烈争辩中进行，苏联代表团长维辛斯基在记者招待会上又发表了重要的谈话，继续以确凿的证据揭露美国的战争挑拨者，重申苏联为保卫和平、保卫联合国、反对新战争煽动者而斗争的坚决立场；且对人民民主力量充满信心。维辛斯基的两次义正辞严的发言，及苏联代表团在大会上的坚决态度，博得了各国民主领袖、进步人士及广大人民的响应和支持，一个遍及欧美的保卫和平维护联合国及反对新战争挑拨者的群众运动正在兴起。南国总理铁托已发出呼吁，号召团结并联合世界一切进步人士为和平而奋斗。英工党左翼齐里亚库斯斥责美国的帝国主义政策，且确言新战争的挑拨是不可能实现的。他指出：“英国工人阶级不愿与苏联作战，英国人民的三分之二愿意和苏联建立更密切的关系。”中南美各国也批评美国在联大的反动立场。在美国国内，产业联合会、美妇女大会、以及许多进步人士、学者与科学家，一致要求美外交政策“应与其他国家合作”，并“指向和平”。美前副总统华莱士更号召美国人民组成“组织优良的抵抗运动，迫使杜鲁门政府及国会改变现行导向战争的各种政策。”他并且肯定的说：“欧洲没有一个国家愿意作战或准备战争的。”
    西欧的危机，一周来仍在继续加深中，为了缓和人民的不满和拯救深重的经济危机，英内阁实行了局部“改组”，但是在英当局仍继续执行其对外依赖美国、对内唯大资本家马首是瞻的政策的情况下，是完全不可能解决甚或减轻其经济危机的程度的。法国经济形势的加速恶化，已使法外交部发言人发出哀鸣：“假使外援不能在十月份得到，法国经济恢复的整个未来将陷于危境，即使十一月或十二月得到援助已嫌太迟。”意大利的加斯贝利政府在彼伏此起的罢工浪潮冲击下摇摇欲坠，这从意议会不信任案的大辩论中，可以看见加斯贝利的政治基础已如何脆弱。目前，英、法、意反动当局已将一切挽救危机的希望寄托于美国贷款的援助上，但是白宫所召开的“援欧紧急会议”之无结果而散，不仅使英法意反动派这一希望前途益发黯淡”，而且也证实了西欧的危机是美国无力亦不可能加以挽救的。
    一周来另一重要事件为德国工人阶级的政党——德国统一社会党第二次全国代表大会的召开及其胜利开幕，以及在辩论中所表现的党内原则的完全一致，体现了德国工人阶级的团结的巩固与一致。代表大会特别提出了党对农民的态度问题，确定建立城镇与乡村劳动人民的统一战线，这对德国工农劳动人民的团结，将起重要的作用。德国统一社会党成立以来的一年半中，党员已增加了百分之三十八，现达一百九十万人（西部占领区的三十二万四千名共产党员尚未包括在内），其中工人成份占百分之四十八，这又表明了德国工人阶级觉悟程度的空前提高，这是欧洲民主势力的重大因素。（新华社）
