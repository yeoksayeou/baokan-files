Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, Urgent Telegram, 5th: Our reporter Yang Geng reports: General Lin Biao's troops rapidly advanced along the Central Chang Road on the 3rd, capturing the cities of Gongzhuling, Changguang, and Kaiyuan, as well as important stations south of Changchun, such as Datun, Fanjiatun, Guojiadian, and Shuangmiaozi. Currently, over 400 li of the railway line between Changchun and Tieling on the Central Chang Road, except for the three isolated strongholds of Siping, Kaiyuan, and Zhonggu, are once again entirely under our control. In a five-battle showdown, our troops also defeated four regiments of the Chiang bandit New First Army at Shuangmiaozi, south of Siping. Additionally, an American-made Chiang aircraft was shot down near Daniuquan in Kaiyuan, with both the plane and its personnel destroyed. The battles across the entire front on the 3rd fully demonstrated the enemy's panic and helplessness. According to prisoners, the bandit New Thirty-eighth Division and the Fiftieth Regiment of the bandit New First Army hastily moved south from Changchun on the 28th of last month to reinforce the area. However, when our troops swept through Kaiyuan, Xifeng, etc. on the 2nd, the army remained huddled in Siping. After the entire 116th Division of the bandit army was annihilated, the four regiments of the army cautiously advanced from Siping towards the Kaiyuan-Shuangmiaozi line. Using 200 vehicles and 3 trains in parallel, they were severely attacked by our forces when they reached Shuangmiaozi, resulting in a complete rout, abandoning ammunition and supplies, and fleeing in disarray. Over 200 bandit army leaders from the army, regiment, and directly subordinate units were captured by us. The New First Army, known as the elite of the Chiang bandits in the Northeast, was so frightened and demoralized! The panic and confusion of the bandit army were not only evident in their headlong flight in Gongzhuling and Changtu, but also in their chaotic communication and incompetent command. After our army annihilated the 116th Division of the enemy on the 2nd, the enemy's 53rd Army headquarters still sent Adjutant Cao Ruicheng from Kaiyuan Station to search for the division commander in the afternoon of the same day. This adjutant finally established "contact" with his division commander among our prisoners. This shows the extent of the confusion and panic of the bandit leader Chen Cheng. The bandit nest of Shenyang has announced a state of emergency starting from the 2nd. The recapture of Gongzhuling, Changtu, and Kaiyuan marks the liberation of the 5th, 6th, and 7th cities, following Yitong, Xifeng, Faku, and Lishu, since the full-scale launch of our army's autumn offensive within the past three days.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, Urgent Telegram, 5th: The main progress on the Northeast battlefield on the second day of the full-scale launch of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army's autumn offensive was the complete annihilation of the Chiang army's 53rd Army's 116th Division. The large-scale annihilation battle took place between Xifeng and Kaiyuan. The division, pursued by the Democratic Allied Army, fled like stray dogs, scurrying east and west, but ultimately failed to escape its fate of being annihilated. On the 1st, when our army recovered Xifeng, the 346th Regiment of the division, which had been guarding the city, abandoned the city and fled westward in a panic. In less than a day, it was overtaken and surrounded by our army at Chumozi. The 347th Regiment was surrounded at Gaozhuodian, west of Xifeng. The 348th Regiment had just fled from the Yehe (north of Xifeng) area to Weiyuanbao (east of Kaiyuan) to meet with the division headquarters when our army arrived on its heels. The enemy fled in panic and ultimately failed to break through our encirclement. Our army launched a general offensive at 7:00 AM on the 2nd and annihilated the division headquarters and three regiments entirely by 9:00 AM. The division commander, Liu Runchuan, chief of staff, Wu Hesheng, and one deputy division commander, as well as six deputy regimental commanders, were all captured. The division was the main force of the 53rd Army and was transferred from the northern section of the Pinghan Railway to reinforce the Northeast at the beginning of our army's summer offensive in June of this year.

　　疾扫中长路四百里迫近长春孤立四平
  　打得新一军丧胆鼠窜
    【新华社东北前线五日急电】本社记者杨赓报导：林彪将军所部大军三日向中长路急速，攻克公主岭、昌广、开原三城，及长春以南之大屯、范家屯、郭家店、双庙子等重要车站。现中长路长春至铁岭间四百余里铁路线，除四平及开原与中固两车站三孤立据点外，已再度全部为我控制。于五战决斗中，我军并于四平以南之双庙子击溃蒋匪新一军四个团。另在开原之大牛圈附近击落美式蒋机一架，人机俱毁。三日全线战斗，充分显示匪军之恐慌与手足无措。据俘虏供称：匪新一军新三十八师及五十等团，于上月廿八日由长春仓惶南下增援，但当二日我军横扫开原、西丰等，该军仍萎缩于四平，迫匪一一六师全部被歼后，该军四个团始探头缩脑由四平向开原、双庙子一线蠢动。并以汽车二百辆、火车三列并驾，当进至双庙子时，即遭我痛击，全部溃败，遗弃弹药辎重，纷纷奔路逃命。其军、团各直属队之匪军头目二百余名，则均被我俘虏。号称东北蒋匪精锐之新一军，竟亦丧胆落魄若此！匪军狼狈慌乱，不仅显象于公主岭、昌图各地之抱头鼠窜，而亦表现于其连帮之错乱及指挥之无能。我军二日歼敌一一六师后，当日下午敌五十三军军部尚由开原车站派出副官曹瑞成前往寻觅该师师长，而此一副官终于在我军俘虏群中与其师长取得“连系”。由此可见匪首陈诚举止失措，极度慌乱之一斑。至匪巢沈阳，已于二日起宣布紧急戒严。按公主岭、昌图、开原之收复，为我军秋季攻势全面展开以来三日内，继伊通、西丰、法库、梨树后解放之第五六七个城市。
    【新华社东北五日急电】东北民主联军秋季攻势全面展开之次日，即二日在东北战场之主要进展，为蒋军五三军一一六师之全师覆灭。大歼灭战系在西丰、开原间进行。该师在民主联军追击下，如丧家之犬，东逃西窜，但终未摆脱被歼命运。一日我军收复西丰时，踞守该城之该师三四六团弃城狼狈西窜，不及一日，即为我军追及，包围于初磨子；该师三四七团则被围于西丰以西之郜涿店；三四八团甫由叶赫（西丰北）一带逃至威远堡（开原东）与该师师部会合，惊魂未定，我军又追踪而至，该敌狼奔豕突，终未冲出我军罗网。我军于二日七时起发动总攻，九时即将其师部与三个团悉数歼灭，该师师长刘润川、参谋长吴贺生及副师长一名，正副团长六名全部擒获。该师为五十三军主力，今年六月我军夏季攻势中，始由平汉北段调援东北。
