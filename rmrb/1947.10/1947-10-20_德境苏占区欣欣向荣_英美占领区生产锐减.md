　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Berlin dispatch: The Soviet Zone of Germany authorities have promulgated new measures to improve the welfare of workers. Marshal Sokolovsky, commander of the Soviet Zone, issued an order on the morning of the 10th, requiring that one million hot meals be prepared daily for workers in the Soviet Zone, without requiring meal tickets. However, factories that fail to meet production targets will not be entitled to this right. The order also stipulates that starting from April 1948, workers in heavy industry will be entitled to 24 days of vacation, and other workers will be entitled to 12 days of vacation, with full pay. Major factories will also establish clinics and employ nurses. According to ADN news agency, the Soviet Zone's brown coal production plan for September was 99.2% fulfilled, briquettes 105.7% fulfilled, and anthracite 100% fulfilled.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Moscow dispatch: Tertzewicz recently wrote in the magazine "World Economy and World Politics" that the economic revival of Germany is characterized by extreme imbalances due to the significant differences in the degree of democratization between the Soviet and British-American occupation zones. In the Soviet Zone, the revival of civilian goods production is the fastest and most successful. In 1947, more than 24,000 factories had started operations in the entire zone, employing 1.2 million workers. The monthly value of goods produced by industry exceeds 500 million marks. The total industrial output has reached 60% of the 1936 level. State-owned enterprises are successfully completing their production plans. In agriculture, as a result of the land reform, the total grain harvest in the zone in 1946 increased by 450,000 tons compared to the previous year. Residents have an ample supply of food. In the first half of this year, the zone transported grain worth 68 million marks to the British and American occupation zones. In the British and American occupation zones, as a result of economic consolidation, production has further declined. Output in May this year was 21% lower than in October 1946, and less than one-third of the 1936 output. Coal production in the Ruhr is only 50% or 55% of the 1938 level. As for land reform, although farmers and immigrants have repeatedly demanded it, it has not been implemented in the zone, resulting in a food crisis. At the same time, due to the protection of landlords by the British and American occupation authorities, grain is used as fodder, or flows into the black market, or falls into the hands of hoarders, making the crisis even more serious.

　　德境苏占区欣欣向荣
  　英美占领区生产锐减
    【新华社陕北十六日电】柏林讯：德境苏占区当局为增进工人福利又颁布新措施。苏占区司令索可洛夫斯基元帅十日晨发布命令，要求为苏占区工人每日准备一百万份热餐，不收餐券。但未完成生产任务的工厂，不能享有此项权利。命令并规定自一九四八年四月起，重工业工人可获得二十四天的休假，其他工人可获十二天休假，工资都照付。各大工厂并将设立诊疗所及护士。又据ＡＤＮ通讯社消息，苏占区九月份褐煤生产计划完成百分之九十九点二，煤球百分之一百零五点七，无烟煤百分之百。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科讯：捷尔左维契近在“世界经济与世界政治”杂志上撰文称：德国经济复兴，由于苏联与英美占领区民主化程度大有差异，而形成极端不平衡的特点，在苏占领区，民用货物生产的复兴，最迅速且最有成就。一九四七年，全区已开工之工厂达二万四千所以上，雇用工人达一百二十万。工业每月生产之货物价值达五亿马克以上。工业生产总量已达一九三六年的百分之六十。国有化企业则顺利完成其生产计划。农业方面，由于实行土地改革的结果，一九四六年全区谷物收获量较前一年增加四十五万吨。居民有充裕的粮食供应，在今年上半年，该区曾运价值达六千八百万马克的粮食至英美占领区。在英美占领区，由于经济合并之结果，生产进一步降低。今年五月份产量较一九四六年十月降低百分之二十一，尚不足一九三六年产量的三分之一。鲁尔的煤产量只有一九三八年水平的百分之五十或五十五。至于土地改革，虽然农民与移民一再要求，但该区迄未实行，以致造成粮食危机，同时由于英美占领区当局庇护地主，粮食被当作刍料，或流于黑市或落入囤积商手中，使危机更加严重。
