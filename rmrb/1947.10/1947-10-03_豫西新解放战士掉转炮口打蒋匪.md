Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 1st. The artillerymen and motor vehicle drivers newly liberated in the Lingbao battle immediately joined our army to pursue the fleeing enemy and attack Shanxian. In the Shanxian battle, the newly liberated artillery commander Ji Shoucai and four gunners stood at posts that previously required fifteen people. Despite enemy shells falling nearby, gunners Yang Jingbo and Wang Shicheng continued to repair the fortifications. Zhang Yongyuan carefully wiped the mud off the shells with oiled cloth. Ji Shoucai gradually connected the previously dried primers to the shell casings. Their overall person in charge, Yan Wenguang, was even busier running between the headquarters and the gun positions. As night fell, the general attack began. Enemy heavy machine guns swept the protective plates in front of the cannons, making rattling sounds. Yan Wenguang calmly aimed, loaded, and pulled the breech. The first shot hit the enemy's artillery observation post, and then fired at the city tower. The first two shots landed in the city, and the third shot went into the city, followed by several consecutive shots that exploded in the city tower, with giant flames and smoke filling the entire city. Our army took advantage of the victory and rushed into the city. The gunners sat on the position to rest. Yang Jingbo humorously said: "In two or three days, old Chiang's newspaper will say again, 'Shanxian is in fierce battle.'"

The eight trucks of the artillery regiment's motor vehicle platoon, newly liberated in the Lingbao battle, were driven by liberated drivers to transport ammunition and cannons, and carried troops to pursue the fleeing enemy. Young Li Shengxiang and Bai Anzhi did not rest day and night. Someone advised him to stop and rest. He said, "What is this? You treat me too well." When some of the car lights broke, Zhao Yinbo took out the light bulb he had secretly saved for two years to use. Whenever they encountered bad roads, they jumped out of the car to repair the road themselves. The political department of a certain regiment specially rewarded them with three million yuan to replenish their clothing, bedding, and shoes. They said, "There was no freedom at all over there. Now it's really like returning to my own home." After the battle, they also helped find the anti-tank artillery commander and gunners. (Follow-up reporters Cui Zhanyuan, Yang Chengbin)

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 1st. Since May, the "Tianshui Detachment" of the People's Liberation Army has liberated a total of 2,862 soldiers of Chiang's army, of whom 2,309 have volunteered to join the People's Liberation Army. At the democratic meetings in the companies, they poured out their bitterness of being conscripted into the army in the Chiang area and suffering from the oppression of officers in Chiang's army, and vowed to fight to the end to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek.

　　豫西新解放战士掉转炮口打蒋匪
    【新华社豫西前线一日电】灵宝战斗中刚解放的炮兵同汽车驾驶兵立即参加我军，追击逃敌并攻击陕县。在陕县战斗中，刚解放的炮长纪守财和四个炮手站在以往需要十五人的岗位上，尽管敌人的炮弹纷纷落在跟前，炮手杨静波、王士成还是不停的修理工事，张永源取出炮弹细心的用油布擦去泥土。纪守财把先晒好的底火逐渐接到炮弹壳上。他们的总负责人阎文广更是忙碌奔走于司令部同炮位间。夜幕低垂，总攻开始，敌人重机枪扫射着炮前的护板，拍拍作响，阎文广沉着的瞄准、装运、拉门，第一炮击中了敌人炮兵了望所，接着就向城楼发炮，头两发落进城里，第三发就钻进城内，接着连续几发都在城楼里炸开了，朵朵巨火，硝烟弥漫全城，我军乘胜就冲进了城。炮手们坐在阵地上休息，杨静波幽默的说：过两三天老蒋的报上又该说“陕县在激战中”了。
    在灵宝战斗中刚解放的炮五十一团汽车排八辆大卡车由解放驾驶兵驾着搬运弹药及大炮，并载着部队追袭逃敌。年青的李生祥、白安志昼夜都不休息，有人劝他停一停，他说这算什么，你们待我太好了。有些汽车灯打坏了，赵银波便把自己偷偷保存了两年的灯泡拿出来用。逢到坏道路时，他们便跳下车子自己修路。某团政治处特奖励他们三百万元，补充了衣被鞋袜。他们说：“在那边没有一点自由，如今真是回到自己家里了。”战斗结束后，他们又帮同找出了战防炮长和炮手们。（随军记者崔占元、杨成彬）
    【新华社西北一日电】解放军“天水部自五月份以来，共解放军士兵二千八百六十二名，其中已有二千三百零九名自愿参加解放军。在连队的民主大会上，他们倾吐在蒋区被抓当兵及在蒋军内受尽军官欺压的苦情，发誓为打倒蒋介石而战斗到底。
