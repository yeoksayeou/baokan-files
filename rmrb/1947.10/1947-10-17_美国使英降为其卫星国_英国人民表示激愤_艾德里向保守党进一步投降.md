Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—Comprehensive reports: The British people are filled with pessimism and indignation over the growing threat of the Labor government turning Britain into the 50th state of the United States. Figures recently released by the British authorities indicate that Britain's foreign trade situation is deteriorating further this fall. Imports totaled $2,052,000,000, while exports amounted to only $1,252,000,000. A correspondent for the Soviet newspaper "Labor" reported earlier this month that in the British Isles, "filled with pessimism, disappointment, and uncertainty about the future," "even government officials do not place great hope in the plans formulated by the government to deal with the economic crisis, because the government still yearns for American aid." A recent public opinion poll in Britain reflected the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the British people with the authorities' subservience to American policies. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 9th, 51% of those surveyed opposed accepting new American "aid" with conditions attached, while only 27% favored accepting it. America's so-called "aid" to Britain is intended to strangle Britain's economic lifeline. According to reports in the British press, Clayton threatened Britain, saying, "If Britain's attitude on the issue of imperial preferential tariffs remains unchanged, the United States will eliminate all aid to Britain in the future." Under this pressure, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 11th, the first step after the reorganization of the Labor cabinet, official sources confirmed, "Britain is prepared to make new concessions to the United States in reducing preferential treatment." Therefore, the Imperial Finance Experts Conference, convened in Britain on September 19, has been postponed indefinitely. Britain originally planned to decide at the meeting to restrict the purchase of American goods internally by the Empire, adjust the need for dollars, and increase the status of the pound sterling. However, it encountered pressure from the American authorities from the very beginning. Canada, which has closer ties with the United States, refused to attend the meeting and demanded that Britain pay at least half of the price of its grain exports to Britain in dollars. Australia also hopes that part of its timber exports to Britain will be paid in dollars. Recent US-Australian negotiations have further alarmed British business circles. According to the London "Truth" newspaper, during the negotiations, the United States demanded that Australia abandon the priority of many British imports and purchase from the United States; the American lure was to grant special tariff treatment to Australian wool exports to the United States. British business circles then advised Australia to pay attention to the painful experience of Anglo-American trade relations. However, in view of the current relationship between Britain and the United States, the impression given is that the British authorities hope to maintain exclusive rights in auctioning off their imperial interests to the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—Comprehensive reports: Prime Minister Attlee has demonstrated his further surrender to Conservative Party policies with his rather large-scale cabinet reshuffle. Attlee announced his decision on the 6th, changing 30 government officials, including the removal of five important ministers (Secretary of War Belenger, Minister of Supply Wilmot, Secretary of State for Scotland Westwood, Minister of Pensions Hynd, etc.), and the reassignment of the relatively left-leaning Minister of Fuel Shinwell to Secretary of War, thus losing his cabinet position. The British Communist Party's "Worker's Daily" pointed out that this reorganization was a "turn to the right" for the cabinet. The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" believes that the political impact of the reorganization is to strengthen the position of the cabinet's "Big Five" (Addison, Morrison, Bevin, Dalton, Cripps) and make the government more right-leaning.

　　美国使英降为其卫星国
  　英国人民表示激愤
    艾德里向保守党进一步投降
    【新华社陕北十三日电】综合报导：英国人民对工党政府使英国降为美国第五十州的日益增长的威胁，充满悲观与愤激之情。日前英当局发表的数字称：本年秋季英国对外贸易的情势更趋恶化中。计入口二十亿五千二百万美元，而出口仅十二亿五千二百万美元。苏劳动报记者月初的通讯称：在“充满悲观失望与前途茫然”的英伦三岛，“甚至政府人士对于政府为应付经济危机所制定的计划，也不寄以很大希望，因政府依然向往美国援助”。英伦最近一次的民意测验，反映了英国广大人民对当局屈从美国政策的不满情绪。据中央社九日电称：被测验者中有百分之五十一反对接受附有条件的美国新“援助”，而赞成接受的仅百分之二十七。美国的所谓“援”英，是要扼死英国的经济命脉。据英报界反映：克莱顿曾威胁英国说：“要是英国在帝国特惠关税问题上态度仍然不变，美国今后将对英国消除一切援助。”在此压力下，据法新社十一日讯，工党内阁改组后之第一步，官方消息证实：“英国已准备在减低特惠制方面对美作新让步，”因此九月十九日在英伦召开的帝国财政专家会议，延而不决。英国原拟在会上决定由帝国内部限购美货，调节美元需要以增加英镑地位。但一开始就碰到美国当局的压力。与美有更密切关系的自治领加拿大，拒绝出席该会议，并要求英国至少以美元偿付其输英粮食价格一半。澳洲也希望其输英木材一部分由美元支付。最近的美澳谈判，更使英国商界人士惊恐。据伦敦“真相”报称：在谈判中美国要求澳洲弃绝许多英国进口货的优先权，而向美国购买；美国的钓饵是对澳输往美国的羊毛给以关税的特别待遇。英国商界于是向澳洲进行规劝，要后者注意英美贸易关系的痛苦经验。但鉴于英美目前的关系，这给予人们的印象，似乎英国当权者希望在向美国拍卖其帝国利益中保持专有权。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】综合报导：艾德礼首相已以其相当大规模的内阁改组，表明其向保守党政策作进一步的投降。艾德礼六日宣布其决定，更动三十个政府官员，其中包括摈除五位重要大臣（陆军大臣贝伦格、军需大臣威尔蒙、苏格兰事务大臣威斯特伍德、抚恤大臣辛德等），并使比较左倾的燃料大臣辛威尔改任陆军大臣而失去其阁员地位。英共工人日报指出：此项改组，为内阁“向右转”。自由党新闻纪事报认为改组的政治影响，是加强内阁五巨头（艾德逊、摩里逊、贝文、达尔顿、克里浦斯）的地位，并使政府右倾。
