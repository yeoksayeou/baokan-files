Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Rome dispatch: Official figures released on the 14th show that the left-wing People's Group (including the Communist Party, Socialist Party, Action Party, and Democratic Labor Party) surpassed Gasperi's right-wing Christian Democratic Party again in the Rome city elections on the 12th, continuing their victory in the city elections of last November, and maintained their advantage. Before this city election, the Christian Democratic Party had fully utilized the favorable situation of the majority of votes of confidence given by the right-wing coalition in the recent Constituent Assembly, and had the support of American imperialism, the Vatican, and various right-wing reactionary forces throughout the country. However, the party still received 4,319 fewer votes than the People's Group. The new distribution of the eighty-one seats in the Rome City Administrative Council is as follows: Left-wing People's Group 27 seats, Christian Democratic Party 27 seats, and the remaining 26 votes are distributed among various small parties.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Rome dispatch: The Italian Communist Party's "Unità" commented on the Rome city elections, saying: "Although there is a united front of the Fascist Party, the Liberal Party, the Common Man's Front, the Christian Democratic Party, and Saragat's right-wing socialists, the People's Group still won victory." The results of the city election show that the People's Group not only recovered the votes lost due to Saragat's betrayal, but also gained another 18,000 votes." "Unità" also analyzed the current situation and nature of the right-wing parties, saying: In the election, the Christian Democratic Party showed that it is a true fortress of plutocrats, pro-fascists, all enemies of Italian revival, supported by Vatican instructions and agents of foreign imperialism, large bourgeoisie and conservatives. The failure of the Common Man's Front (which lost almost half of its votes) and the disappearance of the Liberal Party prove this point: these two parties have lost the support of powerful elements economically; the 50,000 to 60,000 votes they lost went to the Christian Democratic Party. The Common Man's Front has now become a party with slightly middle and small bourgeois characteristics. Saragat's group also suffered a disastrous defeat. The Fascist "Italian Social Movement," with the support of the Christian Democratic government, participated in the election publicly for the first time this time. Despite all this, the People's Trade Union still won victory.

　　意国罗马市选结果
  　人民集团仍占优势
    【新华社陕北十六日电】罗马讯：十四日官方公布的数字显示，十二日罗马市选的结果，左翼的人民集团（包括共产党、社会党、行动党、民主劳工党）继去年十一月市选的胜利，再次超过加斯贝利的右派基督教民主党，而占优势。此次市选前，基督教民主党曾充分利用其最近立宪议会中由右派联合所给予的较多数信任票的有利形势，并有美帝国主义及梵蒂岗以及全国各种右派反动势力的支持，但该党所获选票仍较人民集团少四千三百十九票。罗马市行政会议八十一席之新分配如下：左翼人民集团二十七席，基督教民主党二十七席，余二十六票分配于各种小党派之间。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】罗马讯：意共“团结报”评论罗马市选称：“虽然有法西斯党自由党、平民党、基督教民主党与萨拉盖特右派社会党人联合阵线存在，但人民集团仍赢得了胜利”。市选结果表明人民集团不仅恢复了因萨拉盖特派叛变所失掉的选票，且得到了另外的一万八千票”。团结报又分析右派各党的现势与性质称：在选举中，基督教民主党表现了它是财阀、亲法西斯分子，意大利复兴的一切敌人、听从梵蒂岗指示并为外国帝国主义代理人所支持的大资产阶级与保守分子的真正堡垒。平民党的失败（它失去几乎一半选票）与自由党的销声惹迹，证明这一点：这两党在经济上已失去了强有力分子的支持；他们失去的五万至六万票，是投到基督教民主党方面去了，平民党目前已变成稍带中小资产阶级性的政党。萨拉盖特派也遭到了惨败。法西斯派的“意大利社会运动”则在基督教民主党政府支持下，这回第一次公开地参加了竞选。虽然有这一切，人民工团仍获得了胜利。”
