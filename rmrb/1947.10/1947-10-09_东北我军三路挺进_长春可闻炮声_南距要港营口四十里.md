Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 7th: Our three-pronged counter-offensive army in Northeast China continues to expand its victories, increasingly pressing towards Yingkou and Changchun, the two major cities north and south of the Chiang bandit's Changchun Railway. The Northern Route Army captured Xiaohekan, 20 li northwest of Changchun on the railway line, and Mengjiatun, 10 li south of Changchun, on the 4th. Cannon fire can now be heard within Changchun. The Southern Route Army also recovered Dashiqiao, an important stronghold in the southern section of the Changchun Railway, on the 4th. The Chiang bandits fled in panic, and our army is now only 40 li away from Yingkou, the most important port in eastern Liaoning. The Central Route Army captured Zhonggu Station, 30 li northeast of Tieling, on the 5th, annihilating several hundred enemies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 7th: Two corps of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army swiftly annihilated the 116th Division of Chiang's 53rd Army and recovered Faku, annihilating Chiang's 177th Division (formerly the 7th Detachment of the Eastern Security Force). The Allied Army's casualties were less than one-eleventh of the enemy's. General Lin Biao issued separate commendations. In the battle to annihilate the 116th Division, the general offensive was completed in only two hours, wiping out the 116th Division in one fell swoop. The division headquarters and its three affiliated regimental headquarters suffered over 1,500 officers and soldiers killed or wounded. The enemy division commander, Liu Runchuan, deputy division commander Zhang Shaoxian, division chief of staff Wu Hesheng (formerly misreported as Wu Hesheng), regimental commanders Liu Huantang, Jiang Wangshan, Huang Zhongquan, and over 6,500 other officers and soldiers were captured. The spoils included 12 mountain guns, 4 anti-tank guns, 15 rocket launchers, 11 mortars, 52 60mm mortars, 268 light and heavy machine guns, 1 anti-tank rifle, 337 submachine guns, 2,302 rifles and carbines, 7 radio stations, 23 vehicles, over 100 carts, and 275 warhorses, along with over 200,000 rounds of ammunition. In the battle to recover Faku and annihilate the enemy's 177th Division, a unit of the Democratic Allied Army encircled the enemy with a forced march of 160 li and captured Faku in just one hour, completely annihilating the defending enemy. In this battle, over 100 enemies were killed or wounded, and 1,402 were captured alive. The spoils included 29 anti-aircraft guns, 2 infantry guns, 9 60mm mortars, 13 grenade launchers, 31 light and heavy machine guns, 28 automatic rifles, 1,434 rifles and carbines, 160,000 rounds of ammunition, over 3,000 artillery shells, 3 vehicles, and a large quantity of other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 7th: Since the People's Liberation Army of Ji-Cha-Re-Liao launched a large-scale sabotage campaign on the Suizhong-Shanhaiguan section of the Beining Railway on the 28th of last month, preliminary results as of the 30th are as follows: Six stations were captured: Huangdi, Wanghutan, Qianwei, Gaoling, Tingqiansuo, and Wanjia Tun, as well as nine strongholds, including Shihe Bridge, Gouhe Bridge (i.e., Gaoling River), Lijiapu, and Xiaosonglinggou. The railway line is now controlled from Ertaizi, 3 li west of Suizhong in the east, to Wanjia Tun, 20 li east of Shanhaiguan in the west, spanning over 100 li. Over 60 people were killed, including Wen Herui, the lieutenant colonel and captain of the Second Battalion of the Chiang-puppet Transportation Police. Over 650 people were captured, including the captain of the Second Company of the Chiang Police and Zhao Futang, the deputy captain of the affiliated train company of the Third Battalion of the Chiang bandit Ministry of National Defense's directly subordinate Armored Corps. The entire 204 Armored Train, totaling 16 carriages, was captured, along with 4 field guns, hundreds of artillery shells, and 19 light and heavy machine guns. Eleven railway bridges were destroyed, along with a large quantity of other materials.
