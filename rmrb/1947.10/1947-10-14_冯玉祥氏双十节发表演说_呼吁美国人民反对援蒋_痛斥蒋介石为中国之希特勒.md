　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th—According to Associated Press and Central News Agency reports from New York on the 11th, Feng Yuxiang delivered a speech at a reception for reporters and at a Double Tenth commemorative meeting in New York, calling on Chinese students in the United States and the Chinese people to rise up and strive to realize a truly democratic coalition government. He also called on the American people to rise up and oppose the US government's loans and aid to Chiang for the civil war, and denounced Chiang Kai-shek as China's Hitler, attempting to turn China's 450 million people into slaves. At a reception at the hotel for reporters, Feng fiercely criticized the Chiang government, "comparing Hitler to Chiang Kai-shek." When discussing US loans to Chiang, he asserted that "the Chinese (Chiang) government is a bottomless pit that cannot be filled." He pointed out: "Under the current situation, loans will only be used to buy arms and will not be used for construction." He appealed to the American people: "If the Truman administration decides to grant loans to the Chiang Kai-shek government, then come out and oppose it!" Referring to Sun Ke's September 7th statement that unless the United States quickly aids Chiang, the Chiang government will turn to the Soviet Union, he called it "blackmail and a shameless attitude." After the reception for reporters, Feng delivered a speech at a banquet held by the North American Christian Student Association. Feng pointed out that "China's disaster lies in a few heartless and soulless figures (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique) who hope to turn all 450 million compatriots into their slaves." He "demanded that Chinese students in the United States unite and strive for a truly democratic coalition government in China, and write extensively to their relatives and friends back home to awaken them. Everyone should do their utmost to accelerate the victory of China's democratic cause." Feng expressed extreme optimism about China's future, believing that "the victory of democracy is not far off, and the future democratic China will be very bright."

　　冯玉祥氏双十节发表演说
  　呼吁美国人民反对援蒋
    痛斥蒋介石为中国之希特勒
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据美联社及中央社纽约十一日电，冯玉祥氏双十节在纽约招待记者及在双十纪念会发表演说，号召中国留美学生及中国人民，奋起为实现真正民主联合政府而奋斗，并呼吁美国人民起来反对美政府贷款援蒋内战，并痛斥蒋介石为中国之希特勒，企图变中国四万万五千万人民为奴隶。在旅舍招待记者时，冯氏猛烈抨击蒋政府，“并以希特勒与蒋介石相比。”在谈到美国对蒋借款时，他断言“中国（蒋）政府是一个无底洞，是填不满的”。他指出：“在现况下，贷款只会用以买军火，不会用于建设的。”他呼吁美国人民：“假如杜鲁门政府决定予蒋介石政府以贷款时，就出而反对！”提到孙科九月七日谈话所谓除非美国迅速援蒋，则蒋政府将转而亲苏时，他称之为“讹诈与寡廉鲜耻的态度。”冯氏于招待记者后，即在北美基督教学生会宴会上发表演说，冯氏指出“中国的灾难在于少数无心肝无灵魂的人物（指蒋家匪帮），他们希望把四万万五千万同志都变成他们的奴隶”，他“要求留美的中国学生团结起来，为中国真正的民主联合政府而奋斗，并大量写信回国唤醒其亲友，每个人都应竭尽其力以加速中国民主事业的胜利。”冯氏对中国的前途极表乐观，认为“民主的胜利已经不远了，将来的民主中国是很光明的”。
