　　Chiang Kai-shek Conspires with the American Imperialists to Destroy China
　　Taiwan Becomes Entirely an American Military Base
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] TASS reported from Nanjing on the 20th, relaying a Hong Kong Chinese Commercial Daily Taipei dispatch, that Taiwan has entirely become an American imperialist military base. The message stated: Since Wedemeyer's tour of Taiwan in mid-August, Americans have frequently been seen traveling in jeeps throughout Taiwan, and American planes freely fly to all locations. All airports in Taiwan are stationed with large numbers of American troops, and Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, and Kaohsiung airports are all used by the American Air Force. The Taipei and Kaohsiung airports have become bases for the U.S. 13th Air Force. Currently, large numbers of aircraft are being assembled at various airports.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Central Hebei, 17th] Incidents of smuggling by illegal American troops stationed in China are constantly emerging. Two months ago, U.S. military authorities discovered a large-scale smuggling case led by a senior officer, but secretly suppressed it in an attempt to protect the perpetrators. Recently, the Tianjin press revealed it. According to a Tianjin Ta Kung Pao report on the 1st, the main culprit in the large-scale smuggling case by American troops in Tianjin was Colonel Narram, a senior officer, which also involved many other naval and air force personnel. The scale of their smuggling was extremely large, and their method of operation was to use American military aircraft and ships to transport large quantities of goods such as automobiles, medicines, and chemical fiber products from the United States to China for sale. They also used American transportation to export large quantities of raw materials such as furs from Tianjin to the United States; and they also transported U.S. dollars for others,不受蒋家外汇管制限制, obtaining commissions from this. Although Narram himself was detained by the U.S. military authorities in Qingdao in August, the truth of the case has not yet been announced. The reason why Tianjin reporters only learned of the case now is because the suspect was recently detained by the U.S. and escorted to Tianjin. It has become an open secret that officers of the illegal American troops stationed in China are using their privileges to smuggle. Admiral Cooke, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet stationed in Qingdao, is the biggest smuggler. His large-scale shipment of cars to China for sale using his authority was exposed by American writer Drew Pearson in the February 6th "Washington Merry-Go-Round" magazine.

　　蒋介石勾引美帝亡华
  　台湾全成美军基地
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据塔斯社二十日自南京转播香港华商报台北消息，台湾已全部成为美帝国主义军事基地。该消息称：自魏德迈八月中旬来台游历之后，即时常有美人乘吉普车来往台湾各地，美国飞机亦自由飞航各地。台湾所有各机场都驻有大批美军，台中、台南与台北、高雄等机场都为美空军使用。台北、高雄等飞机场已成为美第十三航空队基地。目前且正在各机场装配大批飞机。
    【新华社冀中十七日电】非法驻华美军走私事件层出不穷。两月前美军当局曾发现以一高级军官为首的大规模走私案，但秘而不宣企图包庇，最近始由津报泄露。据一日天津大公报称：津美军大规模走私案主犯为高级军官纳拉姆上校，其中尚牵连其他海空军人员甚多。其走私规模至为庞大，活动方式系利用美军飞机舰船，自美运入大批货物如汽车、药品、化纤品等来华销售，又利用美方交通工具，自天津向美国输出大量皮毛等原料货物；并曾代人运送美钞，不受蒋家外汇管制限制，从中取得佣金，纳拉姆本人虽已于八月间在青岛被美军当局扣留，但迄未宣布此案真相。津报记者之所以到今始获悉此案，系因该犯最近被美方扣押解抵天津。非法驻华美军军官利用特权走私已成公开秘密，驻青岛美第七舰队司令柯克上将即为一最大走私犯，他利用职权大规模载汽车来华销售一举，曾被美作家德鲁，皮尔逊在二月六日“华盛顿轮特机”杂志上所揭露。
