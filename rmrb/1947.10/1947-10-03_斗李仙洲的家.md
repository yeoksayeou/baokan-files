　　Fighting Li Xianzhou's Home
    Yongjin
    Matao Village in Changqing, on the eastern side of the Jilu Yu region, clings tightly to the west bank of the Yellow River. This is the hometown of Li Xianzhou, the Kuomintang bandit, Deputy Director of the Second Appeasement Zone of Xuzhou, and the vanguard who once attacked the people of Jilu Yu. A few months ago, before Li Xianzhou was captured, Matao Village was still shrouded in a smokescreen. In the past, work in Matao Village was as difficult as pulling seedlings from dry land, and it was difficult to carry out. There were twenty-nine families of pseudo-relatives in the village, and rumors spread throughout the homes all day long. Last September, seeing that Matao Village wanted to launch a struggle, a bad egg from the village who went to Jinan told Li Xianzhou a lie: "The village farmers' association wants to demolish the pavilion on your grave!" Li Xianzhou immediately spread big words: "If this is the case, I will wash Matao." He immediately sent more than forty secret agents, who arrived at his tomb late at night, shining flashlights wildly in the wilderness to intimidate the villagers. In October, he killed Li Qiling, an activist who used to be Li Xianzhou's old worker. Li Qiqian was also arrested and taken to the city. From then on, the militiamen, with nine guns, slept collectively at night. During the day, when they walked past the street, the bad guys gestured with their hands: "Turn back quickly!" Matao fell silent in terror again. This spring, Jilu Yu was caught up in the heated land reform, and Matao was also swept into it. Today, the village holds a meeting, and tomorrow rumors are fabricated. People returning from Jinan pulled on them: "Xianzhou's troops are all equipped with American equipment, one machine gun per squad, and countless tanks and artillery. Xianzhou's planes fly overhead all day long, whirring." These guys did their best to boast about this traitorous brute to intimidate the people of Matao's liberation movement. They also satirized the village activists: "The mouse sleeps with the cat, what courage, when Xianzhou comes, he will teach them a lesson." Some timid people in the village were frightened by Li Xianzhou's power. Matao Village held a meeting for twenty consecutive days during the land reform, and some people suggested dividing Li Xianzhou's land and touching his big poplar tree. Timid people said: "If you move the tree, it will be terrible, don't let Li Xianzhou's plane see it." Matao Village was very interested in joint struggles at that time, and liked to go to other villages to distribute things; but when other villages pulled Matao's things away cart after cart, they were all jealous, but not many people dared to ask for things. The land of Li Xianzhou's family was finally divided under the leadership of activists, and the things were also divided, but the people in the village still had the idea of keeping things for Li Xianzhou. Just during the land reform, the situation in Changqing was somewhat tense, and the cadres and the masses were preparing to fight guerrillas. The enemy on the other side was also preparing to build a bridge across the river. The bad guys in Matao said satirical words to the militiamen: "The Central Army is not good, you militiamen will retreat as soon as you fight there." They also pointed to the Chiang Kai-shek planes and said: "Here comes the People's Liberation Army plane." The militiamen were really angry. A few days later, Commander Chen Yi won a victory in Shandong, and Li Xianzhou was captured alive. The village immediately held a celebration meeting, but some people still doubted and said: "Li Xianzhou will be captured? He is an officer, fighting in the middle, he can also run away by plane." When a picture album of more than thirty captured KMT military officers was sent to Matao, the villagers happily pointed and said: "This is Li Xianzhou, the big traitor, he really embarrassed Matao." The great review began, and the people of Matao no longer had any worries, the rumors disappeared, and the villagers severely beat Li Zhinan, the pseudo-township chief who used to go to Jinan to see Li Xianzhou and brag about him to Li Xianzhou, and handed him over to the government. The bad guys were all punished as they deserved. The big stone was lifted, and the people of Matao turned over. More than ninety women, twelve of them joined the militia. The darkness of Matao turned into light, the terror turned into joy, and the people no longer went to meetings as rarely as in the past. Matao Village, like other villages, used loudspeakers to direct work and convey victory messages.

　　斗李仙洲的家
    勇进
    在冀鲁豫东侧的长清马头村，紧贴在黄河的西岸，这就是曾经进攻冀鲁豫人民的内战先锋蒋匪徐州第二绥区副主任李仙洲的家乡。几个月前，未俘虏李仙洲时，马头村还被烟幕笼罩着。过去，马头村的工作真如旱地里拔葱，是很难开展的，村中有二十九家子伪属，谣言整天家家纷传着。去年九月，眼看着马头村想开展斗争，村里去济南的坏蛋向李仙洲说了瞎话：“村里农会想扒你坟上的亭子哩！”李仙洲马上传出了大话：“如果这样，非洗了马头不行。”就立刻派了四十多个特务，深夜到了他的坟上，在漫野地里乱打手电，来威吓村上的人。十月里；又将积极分子李其领打死了，他过去曾是李仙洲的老雇工。李其乾也被抓到城里去。从此，民兵九支枪夜里都集体睡觉。白天，他们从大街上走过去，坏蛋用手比划着：“快掉头啦！”马头又沉默在恐怖中了。今年春天，冀鲁豫在热烈的土地改革中，马头也被卷进去。村里今天开个会，明天谣言就造出来了。从济南回来的人拉着：“仙洲的部队都是美国装备，一班里一挺机枪，坦克车、大炮没有数。仙洲的飞机整天驾在天顶上，呜呜的飞。”这些家伙们尽其能力夸耀着这个卖国的凶暴，来威吓马头人民的翻身运动。他们并讽刺着村上的积极分子：“老鼠枕着猫瞌睡，胆真不小，等仙洲来了，就要他们好看了。”村中胆小的人，有的是被李仙洲的威风吓着了。马头村在土改时连开二十天的会，有人提意见分李仙洲的地，还弄他的大杨树。胆小的人就说：“弄了树了不得，不要叫李仙洲的飞机看见了。”马头村当时对联合斗争很感兴趣，很喜欢到别的村去分东西；但是别的村上将马头的东西一车一车的拉走的时候，都眼红了，但是敢要东西的人又不多。李仙洲家里的土地终于在积极分子领导下分了，东西也分了，但是村中的人们还存着给李仙洲放着的思想。正在土改的时候，长清的形势有些紧张，干部群众准备打游击，对岸敌人亦准备搭桥过河，马头的坏家伙又说民兵的讽刺话：“中央军不行，你这民兵到那里一打就退啦。”还指蒋机说：“人家八路军的飞机来了。”民兵真真是气得干鼓肚子。没几天，陈毅军长在山东打了胜仗，李仙洲给活捉了。村上马上开了个庆祝大会，但是有些人还这样怀疑说：“李仙洲就会被捉住啦？人家是长官，打仗是在当中，坐飞机也能跑了呀。”当一张三十多个被俘蒋军军官的画报送到马头时，村民高兴的指着说：“这就是李仙洲，大汉奸，真丢马头的人不小呀。”大复查开始了，马头的人民再也没一点顾虑，谣言消声绝迹了，村民将过去经常往济南见李仙洲给李仙洲吹嘘的伪乡长李指南痛殴一顿，交给政府，坏家伙们一个个都受到了应有的惩处。大石头被掀了，马头人民翻了身，妇女九十多人，就有十二个参加了民兵。马头的黑暗变光明，恐怖变成欢乐，人民再不象过去开个会也很少人去，马头村也象其他村一样，用广播筒来指挥工作，来传达胜利消息。
