Ji-Lu-Yu District Party Committee and Administrative Office
　　Special Personnel Lead River Dredging and Water Diversion
　　[Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 21st dispatch] Water diversion work is being actively carried out in various places. Around Shou-Zhang to Yanggu, the wheat field has been expanded by 500 *qing*; 7,000 *qing* of flooded land south of the Jin-Di embankment has begun to be drained into the Grand Canal; 2,500 *mu* has been drained in Gaoling. Cadres and miscellaneous personnel from the District Party Committee and Administrative Office organs responded to the District Party Committee's call to dredge water and plant wheat, directly participating in water diversion to expand the wheat planting area. From the 5th and 6th districts of Shou-Zhang to the southern 7th district of Yanggu, there is a large depression where rainwater accumulates a lot, and more than 80 villages are flooded, with about 500 *qing* of cultivated land. After the District Party Committee and Administrative Office sent people to the waterlogged areas to understand the situation, they held a symposium of village cadres from the flooded districts, exchanged opinions on water discharge, and immediately began dredging. However, this water accumulation is located at the junction of Yanggu and Shou-Zhang, and disputes have arisen due to water over the years. If there is no unified leadership, it is difficult to discharge the water. To this end, the District Party Committee and Administrative Office directly sent people to participate in guiding this work, resolving this historical dispute. The masses understood the common interests and first repaired the Shunshui ditch from outside the North Gate of Zhangqiu to the Huayuan section, a total of fifteen or sixteen *li* long, four *chi* deep, and one *zhang* and five *chi* wide. Except for the 7th district, which did not provide labor, more than 1,700 people from over sixty villages in the other three districts brought their own supplies to participate in the dredging work. They were in high spirits, regarded the water as an enemy, overcame the difficulties of quicksand and collapse, and did not avoid danger. Under the enemy plane's harassment, the digging work was not affected, and it was completed in seven days. During the work, a mobilization song circulated: "To eat our fill, we must work hard. If we can't drain the water, we can't plant the fields, and we'll suffer next year! People in the highlands eat, leaving us lowland people to stare. Everyone, work hard, dig!" Subsequently, they dug the section from Huang-gu-zhong Village, Hou-zhao-wa, Qian-wei-tai to Zheng-cunzhuang, digging a water ditch six or seven *li* long, four *chi* wide, and three *chi* deep. Now, this area of depression has become good farmland.

　　[Another Dispatch] 7,000 *qing* of river-flooded land south of the Jin-di embankment in Shou-Zhang, Fanxian, Puxian, Kunwu, Puyang, and Huaxian, the democratic government is now leading the active repair of sluice gates to guide water into the Grand Canal, and dredging and drainage have also begun on both banks of the Grand Canal. In the 3rd district of Gaoling, there was a lot of rain this summer and autumn, and all the depressions were submerged. Yuan-liu Village alone was flooded with more than 1,100 *mu*. The district office convened a meeting of the nine village cadres to study water discharge methods, and completed the task in one day. The water is now rushing towards the Xiao River, exposing more than 2,500 *mu* of good farmland. At the moment, the masses are happily plowing the land, preparing to plant all of it with wheat. Now the masses in the district are negotiating with Neihuang, wanting to divert the water from the Xiao River into the Wei River. If this work is completed, the area for planting wheat will be further increased.

　　冀鲁豫区党委、行署
  　专人领导挖河疏水
    【本报冀鲁豫廿一日电】疏水工作，各地正积极进行中。寿张到阳谷一带，扩大麦田五百顷；金堤南七千顷被淹地，开始疏水入运河；高陵放水二千五百余亩，区党委、行署机关干杂人员，响应区党委浚水种麦号召，直接参加疏水扩大种麦面积。从寿张五、六区，到阳谷七区南部是大洼，雨季积水很多，八十余村被淹，耕地约五百余顷，区党委、行署派人亲去积水处了解情况后，召开被淹各区村干部座谈会，交换放水意见后，立即疏浚。但这一积水，是阳谷、寿张交界地区，历年因水起纠纷，如不统一领导，很难把水放出。为此，区党委、行署直接派人参加指导这一工作，解决了这一历史的纠纷，群众明了了共同利益，首先修理张秋北门外至花园段之顺水沟，共十五、六里长、四尺深、一丈五尺宽。除七区没工外，三个区六十余村自带给养前来浚工的群众一千七百余人，情绪极高，视水如敌人，克服了淌沙陷淤坍塌的困难，不避艰险，在敌机袭扰下，没影响挖工，七日即竣工。工作中并流传着动工歌：“要吃饱饭，就得好好干。放不了水，种不上田，明年吃饭要遭难！人家高地吃，叫咱洼地人瞪眼看，大家都好好干，挖啊！”随后，又挖皇姑冢村、后赵洼、前魏台至郑村庄段，挖水沟六、七里，四尺宽，三尺深，现在这一带洼地，都成了良田。
    【又讯】金堤南寿张、范县、濮县、昆吾、濮阳、滑县河淹地七千余顷，民主政府现正领导积极修闸口，以导水入运河，运河两岸亦开始进行疏放。高陵三区今年夏、秋雨水很大，所有洼地均被淹没，仅袁六村即被淹一千一百余亩，该区区公所召集该九个村干部会议，研究放水办法，一天内即完成了任务，水已滚滚向硝河流去，露出良田二千五百余亩。刻下，群众正在欢欣的犁地，准备全部种上麦子。现该区群众正酝酿与内黄协商，想将硝河之水导入卫河，如这一工作完成，将更增多种麦面积。
