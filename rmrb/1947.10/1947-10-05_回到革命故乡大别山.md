　　Returning to the Revolutionary Homeland of the Dabie Mountains
    Chen Heqiao
    In the autumn of 1934, I left the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border region and followed the Red Twenty-fifth Army north to resist Japan. This time, I participated in Liu Deng's southward expeditionary army and returned to the Dabie Mountain area, my revolutionary homeland, after thirteen years of separation. I walked through many old battlefields from more than a decade ago and saw the beautiful green hills, lush trees, green pines and cypresses, and golden rice fields, all familiar hometown scenes. At the same time, I saw the lovely elders of my hometown. The people of the Dabie Mountain area, who have a long history of revolution, and their high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, made me very excited. The following are my observations.
    Old "Revolutionaries" Everywhere
    The people of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border region began to participate in the revolutionary struggle in 1927. They experienced the land revolution and the War of Resistance Against Japan, and suffered many setbacks. In a village in Jingfu County, farmers competed to tell us on the threshing ground that their village had housed the township Soviet and the district Soviet (i.e., the district government) fifteen years ago, and they were all members of the peasant association. A farmer smiled naively and asked several North China soldiers:
    "The Communist Party started here, we are all old revolutionaries, do you know that?"
    The comrades present all laughed excitedly.
    While marching in Macheng, an old man in his sixties led the way for the People's Liberation Army. He walked and talked with a soldier in front. The old man asked the soldier:
    "How many years have you been doing revolutionary work?"
    The soldier replied: "I have been in the army for one year and five months."
    The old man laughed and said:
    "I was a land committee member of the district government in 1929, and I led the distribution of land."
    The soldier said happily: "You are really an old revolutionary, please send us a few more miles, okay?"
    The old man nodded and said: "Don't look at me being old, I will send you ten or twenty miles."
    In a village in Liu'an, I met an old woman nearly fifty years old. She said that she used to be a member of the Soviet and led women against feudalism. She pointed to a farmer of twenty-seven or eight years old and said, "He was a child at that time, and he was in the children's corps." Then she said, "You are back again, and we will have a good life."
    "Welcome"
    When the people of the Dabie Mountain area saw the People's Liberation Army, it was like their own children reuniting after a long separation. They grabbed us and told us about the pain they had suffered for more than ten years. In Lihuang, a military dependent said: "After you left, the White Army and local bad guys came and harmed many people; many people who had done revolutionary work were buried alive, and many people starved to death; the people suffered so much disaster. I often said: The Communist Party cannot forget us. I wanted you to come, but I never dreamed that you would come so quickly! Good, don't leave this time, avenge the suffering people!"
    I replied to him at the time: "The comrades of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are always thinking of you; after defeating Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army in the north, Chairman Mao sent Commander Liu to bring us back; this time we will never leave. Resolutely eliminate Chiang's bandit army and the local reactionaries, so that everyone can live a good life."
    Although Chiang's bandit county government ordered the Baojia personnel and the common people to retreat to the mountains, when our army captured Macheng, the merchants of the whole city lined up to welcome our People's Liberation Army, and the shops were open as usual. Many township Baojia personnel continued to work and donated food to the People's Liberation Army. Merchants traveling between Hankou and western Anhui still passed freely through the areas controlled by the People's Liberation Army every day as usual. In some villages, the Baojia personnel were gone, and the elderly came out to help with the food and grass. Once, more than a dozen wounded soldiers of a certain unit stopped in a village in Jingfu. Several soldiers in charge of recruiting and caring for the wounded felt that they could not transport them. Later, an old man came. When he learned that these wounded soldiers were to be transported to a village fifteen miles away, he said: "I will find someone to help." The soldiers were not quite sure what the old man said, but an hour later, the old man brought more than twenty people from the mountain and sent the wounded soldiers away together. The soldiers were amazed at the enthusiasm and help of the masses in this old revolutionary area for the People's Liberation Army. A certain regiment sent more than a dozen wounded soldiers to a small mountain village. The old women in the village discussed how to get food for the wounded soldiers, and each took two wounded soldiers home to take care of them. When we publicized the idea of implementing the distribution of land to the peasants and the principle of tilling their own land, the peasants were very happy. They said that the land revolution in the past was very good, and everyone had food to eat. Later, the White Army came and took the land back. Now you are back again, hurry up and eliminate the White Army and distribute the land as soon as possible.

　　回到革命故乡大别山
    陈鹤桥
    一九三四年秋我离开鄂豫皖边区，随红二十五军北上抗日。此次参加刘邓南征大军又回到离别了十三年的革命故乡大别山区。我走过很多十几年前的老战场，看到了美丽的青山绿树，苍松翠竹，田野间满铺着金黄色的稻子，都是熟悉的故乡景物。同时更见到了可爱的故乡父老，有长期革命经历的大别山区的人民，他们革命的高度热情，使我异常兴奋，下面是我的见闻。
    到处是老“革命”
    鄂豫皖边区人民于一九二七年开始参加革命斗争，他们经历过土地革命与抗日战争，受过许多挫折。在经扶县一个村庄，农民们在打谷场上，争着告诉我们，他这村庄在十五年前住过乡苏维埃，还住过区苏维埃（即区政府），他们都是农民协会的人。一个农民很天真的笑着向几个华北战士问道：
    “共产党是从俺们这里起家的，俺们都是老革命，你知道吗？”
    在场的同志们都兴奋的笑起来了。
    在麻城行军时，一个六十多岁的老头给解放军带路，他同一个战士在前面边走边谈，老头问战士：
    “你干革命工作有多少年？”
    战士答：“我到军队来有一年零五个月了”。
    老头笑起来了，他说：
    “我在民国十八年就当过区政府土地委员，领导分过土地哩”。
    这位战士很高兴的说：“你真是老革命，请多送我们几里路好吗？”
    老头点头说：“莫看我老了，也要送十几二十里呀。”
    在六安某村，遇到一位年近五十岁的老大娘，她说从前当过苏维埃的委员，领导过妇女反封建。她指着一个二十七八岁的农民说：“他那时是小孩，当童子团的。”又说：“你们可又回来了，我们可要过好日子了。”
    “欢迎”
    大别山区老百姓见到解放军就象自己的子弟久别重逢一样，拉住我们亲切的诉说他们十几年来所受的痛苦。在立煌一位军属说：“你们走了，白军和本地的坏人来了，害了多少人；很多干过革命的人被活埋了，不少的人饿死了；人民遭了多大的灾难呀。我常说：共产党是不能忘记我们的。想你们来，做梦也没想到来的这样快呀！好吧，你们可不要走了，给受难的人们报仇吧！”
    我当时回答他：“共产党和解放军的同志，无时不在挂念你们；在北方把蒋介石匪军打败了，毛主席就派刘司令带着我们回来了；这一次一定不走了。坚决消灭蒋匪军和本地反动派，让大家过好日子。”
    虽然蒋匪县政府下令，强迫保甲人员和老百姓一律撤退上山，但我军攻下麻城时，全城商民排队欢迎我解放军，商店照常营业。不少的乡镇保甲人员，继续办公，为解放军募捐粮食。往返汉口皖西的行商，每天仍照常的自由通过解放军所控制的区域。有的村庄保甲人员不在了，年老的人就出来帮助办理粮草。有一次某部在经扶有十几个伤员停在一个村庄里，几个负责招护伤员的战士感到无法运送，后来，来了一位老汉，当他知道这些伤员要运到十五里以外的村庄去后，他说：“我去找人来帮忙吧。”战士们还不敢十分相信这老汉所说的话，但过了一小时以后，老汉从山上带来了二十多个人，一齐把伤员送走了。战士们无不惊叹这老革命地区群众对解放军的热情和帮助。某团把十几个伤员送到一座小山庄上，庄上的老大娘，便纷纷计议给伤员们弄饭吃，每个人并自动领两个伤员回家，负责照护。当我们宣传要实行农民分田地，实行耕者有其田的主张时，农民们都非常高兴，他们说，过去土地革命办的很好，大家有饭吃，后来白军来了，又把土地夺回去了。现在你们又回来了，赶快把白军消灭了早些均田吧。
