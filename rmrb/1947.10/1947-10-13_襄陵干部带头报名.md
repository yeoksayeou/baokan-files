Xiangling Cadres Take the Lead in Enrolling
[This Dispatch] At the expansion of cadres meeting in Xiangling County, the task of joining the army was proposed. They were divided into groups for deliberation and discussion. On the first day, the cadres were not very confident and raised many difficulties. Some said: "Now the masses are busy with harvesting autumn crops and planting wheat, it would be better to do it after the autumn harvest." Some said: "Now the troops are stationed in the villages, and the masses are providing labor, so it is better to wait a few days before acting." On the second day, Comrade Xie Yutian from the Prefectural Committee gave a speech, explaining the importance of joining the army and pointing out that the great counter-offensive has already begun. In order to defend the fruits of the masses' emancipation and defeat the traitorous head Chiang Kai-shek, we must expand the people's armed forces. After the meeting, each group conducted heated discussions again, and everyone had a clear understanding of the current new situation, and the confidence of each comrade was greatly improved. Comrade Qin Guodong said: "To successfully complete the task, we must first get through the masses' thinking. I guarantee to mobilize five people and take the lead in joining the army myself." Li Anbao said: "I will definitely complete the task!" Zhang Cunyao said: "To complete the task, cadres taking the lead and party members joining the army is the best way, and mobilize women not to hold back." Comrade He Tingxin said: "Now that the great counter-offensive has begun, the main force has been sent out. We must expand the local armed forces, eliminate the enemies in front of us, and protect the lives and property of the people in our liberated areas." On the third day, County Secretary Yao summarized, calling on party members and cadres to respond to the call of the Party and take the lead in joining the army. As soon as he finished speaking, the directors of the armed committees of the first and second districts, Comrades Duan Huguan and Liang Xiaoquan, immediately stood up and volunteered to join the army. Duan Huguan said: "Now that the counter-offensive has arrived, in order to protect the fruits of the peasants' emancipation, I am willing to take the lead in joining the People's Liberation Army, and will not return home until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown." There was thunderous applause on the spot, and the cadres all cheered. The atmosphere suddenly became tense. Then the cadres in each district deliberated and volunteered one after another. A total of 600 young people were guaranteed to join the People's Liberation Army, exceeding the task by two times. After the meeting, the cadres in each district returned to their posts and are now mobilizing.
