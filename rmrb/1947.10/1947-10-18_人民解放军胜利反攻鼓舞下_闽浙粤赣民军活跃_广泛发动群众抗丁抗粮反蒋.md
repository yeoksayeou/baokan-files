Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th – According to publications in Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas, the people's armed forces operating in the vast areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces in the southeast rear of the Chiang Kai-shek area have become increasingly active in recent months, encouraged by the victorious counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army. They are striking at Chiang bandits everywhere, mobilizing the masses, opening granaries to provide relief to the poor, and launching surging armed struggles against conscription, grain tax, and Chiang Kai-shek. The people's armed forces in the Siming Mountains area of eastern Zhejiang, despite being subjected to continuous "encirclement and suppression" by Chiang's troops for two years since the Japanese surrender, and including several personal "supervisory suppressions" by Chiang's Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie, have continued to grow stronger. Currently, the vast rural areas of Dinghai, Yin County, Yuyao, Zhenhai, Cixi, Shangyu, Xinchang, Sanmen, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Wenling in eastern Zhejiang; Changshan, Qu County in western Zhejiang; Jiaxing, Wuxing, Haining, Fuyang, Changhua, Changxing in northern Zhejiang; and Pujiang, Zhuji and other twenty counties in central Zhejiang are under the control of the people's armed forces, threatening the Chiang bandits’ railways and highways. Zheng Xiaoyin, the Chiang family’s commissioner of the Third Administrative Region of Zhejiang Province, lamented in his plea for help to Shen Honglie that the people's guerrillas in the region had returned to the state they were in during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the first half of this year, young farmers in the Siming Mountains area launched a heated campaign to join the army, joining the local militia to strike at Chiang bandits. In June, the people's armed forces in eastern Zhejiang launched decentralized operations, attacking Chiang bandit township offices, self-defense forces, etc., everywhere, seizing a large number of enemy weapons to strengthen themselves. After July, they regrouped, from attacking villages to threatening cities, and established the Eastern Zhejiang Administrative Office and democratic county governments in the "Sanbei" area (i.e., the area north of Yuyao, Cixi, and Pi County) and the Siming Mountains, leading the resistance against conscription and grain tax. They have gained extremely popular support. The people's armed forces in Pujiang, Zhuji, and Fuyang, Changhua areas in central Zhejiang, as well as the Taihu Lake and the sea off eastern Zhejiang, are also very active. The powerful militia units led by Hu, Guo, etc., operating in the Huangshan area on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui, once occupied Jixi County in southern Anhui.

The people's armed forces in various parts of Fujian, which have been growing rapidly in recent victories against Chiang's troops, are also gaining momentum. The troops under Huang Guozhang, commander of the Central Fujian Military Sub-district, have recently expanded to Yongchun and other counties in southern Fujian, and have marched south to join forces with the Daiyun Column and the Wang militia operating in the Longxi Anxi mountain area. Sometimes they launch joint attacks to open granaries and provide relief to the poor; sometimes they break up into smaller units to harass the enemy. The troops are strictly disciplined and do not commit the slightest offense against the local people, winning the support of the broad masses of the people, and the troops are expanding rapidly. During breaks in combat, they also lead the people in southeastern Fujian in various anti-Chiang struggles. In the Yongchun, Dehua, Xianyou, and Putian areas, they launched the "opening warehouses to distribute grain" movement; in the coastal Huian, Nan'an, Jinjiang, and Anhai towns south of Jinjiang, they launched a widespread movement to severely punish Chiang's corrupt officials, severely striking at the Chiang bandits’ reactionary regime. Recently, they launched a farmers’ "anti-Chiang resistance to taxes" movement. This vigorous mass struggle has caused extreme panic and unease among the Chiang bandits’ Fujian provincial authorities. The provincial chairman Liu Jianxu hastily convened an "emergency security conference" of nine counties and ordered the recruitment of hooligans and villains to organize so-called self-defense forces in various townships in an attempt to resist the militia. They are also wantonly arresting, killing, and extorting the people everywhere on charges of "colluding with bandits" and "aiding bandits." However, this move by the Chiang bandits has directly forced the broad masses of the people to rise up in armed self-defense. Young people in the five counties of Southeastern Fujian, including Nan'an, have recently organized a "Conscript Alliance" to resist Chiang's "general mobilization order," automatically arming themselves to resist Chiang's conscription for the civil war. Many young and middle-aged people are carrying weapons and joining the people's army to defend their homes and families. A certain Zhang, a special agent in Nan'an, was recently ambushed and killed by the masses on his way to the Nan'an County Government for informing and framing villagers. The broad masses of the people in southern Fujian are willing to offer everything they have to strengthen their armed forces. Some young farmers even sell themselves as conscripts and donate the proceeds to the militia to buy weapons, and then escape back with weapons to join the militia in the shortest possible time. In another case, an old lady in a certain county donated her gold ring, which she had painstakingly saved up to buy. Several units of maritime militia armed forces based in Kunshan in Xiapu County and Lianjiang County along the coast of southern Fujian are also mobilizing at any time to threaten the Chiang bandits’ sea transportation lines from Guangdong to Xiamen and Fuzhou.

The people's armed forces on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi are also launching continuous attacks. On August 12, the militia in the Qingtangxu mountainous area of Yingde in northern Guangdong engaged in a fierce battle with the invading Chiang troops for two hours, killing and wounding more than 60 Chiang officers including the battalion commander and county magistrate, and seized four light machine guns, two submachine guns, more than 60 rifles and other military supplies. In August, the militia in Wengyuan (northeast of Yingde) launched a "recruitment movement" against Chiang's troops. In the Xinjiang, Bazi, and Hengshishui areas alone, more than 100 Chiang "Self-Defense Force" and "Joint Defense Team" members came over with their weapons to join the militia. Due to the strength of the people's armed forces, peasants in various counties on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi are now launching anti-feudal struggles, and their lives have been greatly improved.

　　人民解放军胜利反攻鼓舞下
  　闽浙粤赣民军活跃
    广泛发动群众抗丁抗粮反蒋
    【新华社陕北十五日电】据蒋管区报纸刊物透露：驰骋于蒋区东南后方浙、闽、粤、赣诸省广大地区之人民武装，近数月来，在人民解放军胜利反攻的鼓舞下益形活跃。到处打击蒋匪，发动群众，开仓济贫，掀起汹涌澎湃的武装抗丁、抗粮的反蒋斗争。浙东四明山区人民武装，自日本投降以来虽处于蒋军两年不断“清剿”，且包括蒋记浙省主席沈鸿烈数次亲自“督剿”之下，仍日益壮大。目前浙东之定海、鄞县、馀姚、镇海、慈溪、上虞、新昌、三门、绍兴、萧山、温岭；浙西之常山、衢县；浙北之嘉兴、吴兴、海宁、富阳、昌化、长兴；以及该省中部之浦江、诸暨等二十余县广大农村，均在人民武装力量控制之下，并威胁蒋匪铁路公路线。蒋家浙省三区专员郑小隐在其向沈鸿烈求救时曾哀鸣，该区人民游击队已恢复到抗战时期之态势。今年上半年四明山区青年农民曾发动热烈的参军运动，加入当地民军打击蒋匪。六月间浙东各地人民武装，曾分散作战，到处袭击蒋匪乡公所自卫队等，大量收缴敌人武器壮大自己。七月以后，复汇合起来，从进击乡村到威胁城市，并在“三北”（即馀姚、慈溪、邳县三县以北地区）一带及四明山等地建立浙东行政公署及各县民主县政权，领导抗丁抗粮。极得人民拥护。浙江中部浦江、诸暨、及富阳、昌化一带及太湖与浙东海面民军武装也很活跃。活动于浙皖边界黄山区之强大民军胡、郭等部，曾攻占皖南的绩溪县城。
    声势浩大之福建各地人民武装，近于屡创蒋军取得不断胜利中，得到飞跃的发展。闽中军分区司令黄国璋所部，近已发展至闽南永春等县，且长驱南下与戴云纵队及活动于龙溪安溪山地之王部民军胜利会师。时或合力出击，开仓济贫；时或化整为零，分散袭敌。部队纪律严明，对当地人民秋毫无犯，深得广大人民拥戴，部队得到迅速扩展。于战斗间隙更领导闽东南一带人民进行各种反蒋斗争。在永春、德化、仙游、浦田地区，发动“开仓库分赋谷”运动；在沿海岸惠安、南安、晋江、及晋江以南之安海镇各地，揭起广泛的严惩蒋家贪官污吏运动，予蒋匪反动政权以严重打击。最近并发动农民“反蒋抗缴”运动。此种如火如荼的群众斗争，已使蒋匪闽省当局极度恐慌不安，该省主席刘建绪慌忙召开九县“紧急治安会议”，并下令收买流氓恶棍组织所谓各乡镇自卫队，企图对抗民军。并到处以“通匪”、“济匪”罪名大肆捕杀、敲榨人民。但蒋匪此举更直接逼迫广大人民起而武装自卫。闽东南安等五县青年，为反抗蒋贼“总动员令，”近已组织“壮丁大同盟”，自动武装起来，反抗蒋贼抓丁进行内战。许多青壮年更纷纷携枪投人民军，自卫保家。南安某张姓特务因告密陷害村民，近于赴南安县府途中遭群众伏击而死。闽南广大人民为了壮大自己武装，均愿献出自己的一切，甚至有青年农民以自己出卖作壮丁，将所得之款献给民军购买武器，而自己又于最短期间携械逃回参加民军。另有某县某老太太，把辛劳积蓄购得之金戒指也献出来。闽南海面以霞浦县的昆山及连江县一带作根据地的水上民军武装若干部，近亦随时出动，威胁蒋匪由广东通厦门、福州的海上交通线。
    粤赣边境人民武装也不断出击。八月十二日广东北部英德青塘圩山区民军，曾与进犯蒋军激战两小时，毙伤蒋记营长县长以下六十余名，并缴获轻机枪四挺，手提机枪二挺，长短枪六十余支及其他军用品甚多。翁源（英德东北）民军于八月间更对蒋军展开“招降运动，仅新江、坝子、横石水一带，蒋“自卫队”“联防队”即有百余人携械来归加入民军。由于人民武装力量强大，粤赣边各县农民现均发动反封建斗争，生活大为改善。
