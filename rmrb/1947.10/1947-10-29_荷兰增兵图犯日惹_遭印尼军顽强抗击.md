　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Comprehensive reports: After the Dutch invading forces' reinforcements successively arrived in Indonesia, they began a third full-scale offensive to invade Yogyakarta at the beginning of this month. It is reported that fierce fighting is currently taking place in Wumbal in East Java and Jamban in West Java. In addition, Dutch troops are also fiercely attacking Klaten and Mendilan in Central Java, 35 kilometers from Yogyakarta. The Indonesian army is currently putting up a tenacious resistance. Former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir stated emphatically: "Regardless of the superior modern equipment possessed by the Dutch army, the Indonesian army is determined to resist, and the Republic will never yield to Dutch imperialists." In addition to shielding the Dutch acts of aggression in the Security Council, American warmongers are also attempting to directly assist the Dutch in massacring the Indonesian people through military means. According to a TASS report: Colonel Rom, commander of the 13th Reconnaissance Squadron of the U.S. Air Force, has arrived in Makassar, the capital of Celebes, to plan the construction of a new airport. This action by the United States has aroused strong anger from the Indonesian side. The Indonesian News Agency stated on the 24th that many Indonesian parliamentarians pointed out that the various suzerain states in the Security Council are hindering Indonesia from obtaining a just peace, and the United States should bear the primary responsibility for this.

　　荷兰增兵图犯日惹
  　遭印尼军顽强抗击
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】综合报导：荷兰侵略军在其增援部队陆续抵达印尼后，已于本月初旬开始第三次全面侵犯日惹之攻势。据悉目前猛烈之战争，除在东爪哇之温巴尔及西爪哇之占旁进行外，荷军并在中爪哇强攻离日惹三十五公里之克拉登及门第兰。印尼军现正顽强抵抗中。前印尼内阁总理沙利尔力称：“不管荷军拥有优势现代装备，印尼军还是坚决抵抗，共和国永不会向荷兰帝国主义者屈服”。美国战争贩子除在安理会上庇护荷兰侵略暴行外，并图在军事上直接助荷屠杀印尼人民。据塔斯社讯：美空军第十三侦察队洛姆上校已抵西里伯斯京城马加撤，筹划建立新机场。美国此举，已引起印尼方面之强烈愤怒。印尼通讯社二十四日述称：印尼许多议员指出：安理会上各个宗主国正在妨碍印尼获取正义之和平，美国对此应负主要责任。
