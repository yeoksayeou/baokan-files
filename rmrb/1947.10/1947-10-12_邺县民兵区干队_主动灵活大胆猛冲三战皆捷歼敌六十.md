　　Ye County Militia District Cadre Team
  　Proactive, Flexible, Bold, and Fierce, Achieving Victory in Three Battles and Eliminating Sixty Enemies
    [This newspaper's Ye County News] In order to suppress the ferocious flames of the enemy and the feudal armed forces of the Hui Men (secret societies), on the 18th of last month, the entire district's militia district cadre team and armed detachment proactively attacked the enemy in three routes. The first route advanced to the east of Zhang Guantun, the second route advanced from the front to Hengdaokou between Zhang Guantun and Lancun, and the third route advanced to West Lancun. At this time, more than 400 members of the enemy's "Ji Flag Society" departed from Chongzhao and advanced towards Lancun. Before our departure, we deeply mobilized the militia, and each squad's courage was doubled, and morale was very high. When entering the battle, everyone hid by the side of the ditch, obeyed orders, and when the enemy charged our front line, we immediately launched a counter-charge. The enemy charged four times, but were all repelled. The enemy became enraged and concentrated their forces to fiercely attack the west of Lancun. Our team members resisted heroically, immediately killing ten enemies and wounding ten. After inflicting casualties on the enemy, we took advantage of the victory and launched a second charge from the north of Lancun, forcing the enemy back to East Lancun. At the same time, we engaged in a "pushing mill" battle with the enemy, circling within the village several times. The enemy was frightened and fled in panic. A total of 35 enemies were killed or wounded. (Yu Sheng, Ming Zhong)
    [This newspaper's Ye County News] On the 22nd of last month, more than 100 members of the "Yellow Flag Society" feudal armed forces from the three villages of Chongzhao, Lancun, and Zhang Guantun, carrying more than 50 rifles and one machine gun, attempted to attack our Beichengwang Village and organize Hui Men in Dazhanggai and Yazhuang villages. When the enemy advanced to the north of Dazhanggai, the county committee's Li Tianrang and others personally commanded and deployed this battle. When the enemy rushed to the south of Dazhanggai and planted the Hui Men flag around the village, and set up altars and hung red and green tents in Dazhanggai and Yazhuang, our district cadre team had already inserted behind the enemy from the east, and another unit simultaneously inserted behind the enemy from the west. As soon as the charge horn sounded, shouts of killing arose everywhere. At a distance of one to two hundred meters from the enemy, we fired fiercely at the enemy. At this time, the enemy was under attack from three sides and could not break through in any direction. Seeing the critical situation, the enemy did not dare to return fire, and even abandoned the flag of the commander, and fled in panic through the gap in the north. We took advantage of the situation to pursue them all the way to Lancun, fifteen li away, killing or wounding more than 20 enemies, capturing 24 chi of white cloth, six quilts, eight livestock, several red-tasseled spears, three-pronged forks, knives, etc., one pig, one bicycle, two flags, and destroying two Hui Men altars. When we returned, the militiamen, pulling the livestock and carrying the quilts, happily said, "They look very imposing, but they are loose when fighting." (Chen Fu, Yu Sheng)
    [Another News Item] On the 12th of last month, the puppet Wang Huaixin colluded with more than 100 Hui Men members, attempting to rob grain from our Zhangjiatun and capture our village cadres to organize Hui Men. After the Li Yuan joint defense militia learned of this, they rushed to intercept them under the leadership of Comrades Sun and Zhang. In the battle, the enemy charged us twice, but were both repelled. In this battle, three enemies were killed and five were wounded (including Miao Jingsheng, the head of the Hui Men in Heguantun). On the same morning, the two squads of our Zhaoguantun group militia, Wu Desheng and Zhang Tinggui, and the district cadre team, proactively harassed the enemy in Liguantun. As soon as the gunfire rang out, the enemy was in great chaos, shouting, "We are surrounded by the Eighth Route Army!" Our militia district cadre team immediately launched a brave attack and killed two enemies with sniper fire. From then on, the enemy never dared to live permanently in that village again.

　　邺县民兵区干队
  　主动灵活大胆猛冲三战皆捷歼敌六十
    【本报邺县讯】六区为了镇压敌人和会门封建武装的凶焰，上月十八日，全区民兵区干队武支队分三路主动向敌出击，第一路进至张官屯东地，第二路从正面进至张官屯、兰村中间之横道口，第三路进至西兰村。这时敌“冀旗会”四百余人，从崇召出发，向兰村进犯。我在出发前，对民兵深刻动员，各班勇气倍增，情绪很高，在进入战斗时，大家伏在沟边隐蔽，听从指挥，这时敌人向我正面阵地冲锋，我即发起反冲锋，敌连冲四次，均被击退，敌便恼羞成怒，集中力量，向兰村西地猛冲，我队员英勇抗击，当即毙敌十名，伤十名。予敌杀伤后，乘胜由兰村北地，发起二次冲锋，将敌逼回东兰村，同时与敌展开推磨战，在村内转了数圈，敌人胆战心惊，狼狈而逃，计毙伤敌人三十五名。（玉生、名中）
    【本报邺县讯】上月二十二日，有崇召、兰村、张官屯三村之“黄旗会”封建武装，共百余人，带步枪五十多支，机枪一挺，企图进攻我北成旺村，并到大张盖、亚庄两村组织会门。该敌进至大张盖北地时，县委李天让等亲自指挥，布置这一战斗。当敌人冲到大张盖南地，将会门旗插在村的周围，在大张盖，亚庄两村设起会坛，挂起红绿帐时，我区干队早从东面插入敌后，另一部同时从西边插入敌后，冲锋号一响，杀声四起，喊声遍地，在离敌百十余米远处，向敌猛射。这时敌人处在三面夹攻之下，东碰西撞，都冲不出去，敌见形势危急，一枪亦不敢还，领兵旗也不顾拿了，便从北面的空隙处狼狈逃窜，我乘势一直追赶到十五里路之兰村，计毙伤敌二十余名，缴获白布两丈四尺，被褥六条，牲口八头，红缨枪、三股叉、刀子等数条，猪一口、自行车一辆、旗两面，摧垮会门神坛两个。我返回时，民兵们拉着牲口，背着被子，高兴的说：“看样子很神气，打起来稀松。”（陈甫、玉生）
    【又讯】上月十二日伪汪怀沁结合会门等百余人，企图到我张家屯抢粮及捕捉我村干部，组织会门，我黎园联防民兵得息后，在孙张二同志带领下，驰往阻击。在战斗中，敌向我连冲两次，均遭击退，此役计毙敌三名，伤五名（内有何官屯会门头子苗景生）。同日上午，我赵官屯集团民兵吴德生、张廷贵两个小队，和区干队，主动袭扰黎官屯之敌。枪声一响，敌即大乱，大喊：“被八路军包围着了啊！”我民兵区干队即勇猛冲击，并用冷枪打死敌人两名，从此敌再也不敢在该村常住了。（邺县联合办公室、玉生、陈甫）
