　　Lin County Women Make 70,000 Pairs of Military Shoes in Five Days

    [This newspaper's Lin County News] After our counter-offensive army marched south, the women of Lin County made 70,000 pairs of military shoes for the soldiers at the front. They completed the task victoriously within five days and transferred them to the southern expeditionary army on the 30th of last month. During this shoe-making effort, the increased class consciousness of the women was fully demonstrated. For example, in Weijian, Fourth District, after the cadres explained the significance, time frame, and quality requirements of this shoe-making effort at a general women's meeting, they let everyone discuss how to proceed. Everyone unanimously guaranteed to complete the task on time. They immediately formed groups freely, with every three women making two pairs of shoes, helping each other to rush the work. Each group also proposed challenges, with the conditions being: beautiful color and skillful handwork, to see who could do the best and fastest. Every woman was eager to be the first, working day and night to rush the work. In four days, they completed the task. The colors were uniformly dark gray, with durable stitching, thousand-layer soles, lined in cloth, new inside and out, and attractive and sturdy. At the shoe-sending ceremony, Zhao Heying (chairwoman of the Women's Federation) and three others were selected as first-class models, Zhang Guiping and two others as second-class models, and Qin Lianying as a third-class model. In Li Jiaman, Tenth District, the mother of Guo Wengui, a military dependent, was over sixty years old and unable to see well enough to do fine work, so she led the children and twisted rope for the young women. Xu Meixian, the chairwoman of the Women's Federation, said, "The army fights day and night, which is more difficult than us, so we should also rush to do it at night and complete it early to send it to the front, guaranteeing that our counter-offensive army will win."
