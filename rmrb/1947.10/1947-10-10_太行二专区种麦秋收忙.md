　　Taihang Second Special District Busy with Wheat Planting and Autumn Harvest
　　[Report from our newspaper in Taihang] The sorghum is red, the millet is golden, and men, women, and children are busy with harvesting and planting. All counties in the Taihang Second Special District are working hard on wheat planting and autumn harvesting, with both border and interior areas involved in this movement. Xiayu, facing a shortage of labor and livestock, organized all available labor to participate in this work. They organized three teams of people pulling plows and thirteen teams of people pulling seed drills to rush planting. Seventy-two women also helped with planting, digging, and delivering meals. In seven days, they have planted more than 1,000 mu. In ChengGuan County, Zhao Chuntang's textile group in Qianjie planned to complete the harvest of their 134 mu of autumn crops independently and guaranteed not to use men for harvesting. In Yushe Wu Yuan, to compensate for the poor harvest due to drought, mutual aid groups discussed significantly expanding wheat fields. Elderly men, women, and children rushed to pick mung beans, dig yams, and plant wheat after the stubble was cleared. Livestock were uniformly allocated according to gullies and ridges. They have now completed planting. Under the slogan "Farmers all over the world are one family," Qixian in the border area, the first district specially formed a harvesting team of more than 530 people to assist the second district with harvesting. The harvesting work began at the beginning of last month. The method used was armed protection for all available labor to rush to the fields for harvesting, and the crops were carried to transfer stations. Women and children at the stations then sorted the crops, and the crops were transported from the transfer stations to grain storage destinations. In Qixian Third District, nine villages including Houjiazhuang, Shangzhuang, and Xiaao organized people to pull plows for wheat planting. Currently, 60 percent of the wheat fields have been planted. Various places have paid attention to prioritizing harvesting and planting for military dependents during the wheat planting and autumn harvest. (Pi Yu, Xing Hua)
