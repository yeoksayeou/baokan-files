Hebei-Shandong-Henan Eighth Administrative Region Studies Methods
　　Dredge Rivers and Divert Water to Expand Wheat Planting
　　[Our newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 12th dispatch] The Eighth Administrative Office established a river management committee to vigorously organize the masses to dredge rivers and divert water. After receiving the administrative office's instruction to "dredge rivers, divert water, and expand the wheat planting area," the special office immediately convened a symposium on September 14 with relevant personnel from Puyang, Qingfeng, Weihe, and Nanle counties to study methods for dredging rivers and diverting water to expand the production area. After detailed group discussions, it was decided to proceed according to the following principles: First, in order to unify leadership, unified steps, and actions, river management committees should be organized in coordination with relevant counties; Second, it was determined that Qingfeng would dredge 25 *li* of the Majia River to the south, with Puyang responsible for dredging and Qingfeng would dredge 45 *li* of the Long River to the north, with Qingfeng, Weihe, and Nanle responsible. Efforts would be made to start construction before the 20th and complete it before the 25th; Third, expenses would be saved, and without using a single grain of border region grain, the laboring villages would provide their own supplies, and later the counties and districts would adjust as appropriate; Fourth, the damaged roads would be repaired by the local villages, and bridges would be erected immediately. After the meeting, each county convened a joint meeting of district and village cadres to convey the spirit of dredging rivers and diverting water. Cadres went to the masses to widely publicize and mobilize, clarify the historical contradictions caused by dredging rivers and the current sentiments of the masses towards dredging rivers, in order to solve the problems with emphasis. After two days of extensive publicity and mobilization, the masses had a further understanding of the river dredging work. Song Village in the fifth district of Weihe is a historical focal point of contradictions. Because the village is located on high ground, if the water from the Zhao Village slope of the Pu River is put into the Majia River, it must be dug through this area. Because the downstream of the Majia River is silted up and cannot flow smoothly, it is easy to flood the land, thus creating a historical and serious contradiction with the villages on both sides of the river. This time, during the river management, Comrade Song Hongyin, the instructor of the village, convened a mass meeting of the whole village and said: "According to the spirit of this river dredging, it is guaranteed that we will not be flooded. The higher authorities will never make one cry and another laugh. If something is picked up on the ground, the higher authorities will find a way to adjust it. In the past, the contradictions between us and Zhao Village slope were all caused by the landlord ruling class." The masses were very excited after listening, and immediately took tense action. More than 2,000 farmers in the seventh district of Puyang rushed to work in the middle of the night. More than 10,000 people on the entire river line set out on the morning of September 20, some building dikes and some digging mud. After the accumulated water on the Zhao Village slope was dredged, the masses automatically looked for targets, organized mutual aid groups, and rushed to plant wheat. Some sought loans from banks and hurried to buy cattle to launch an assault on wheat planting.

　　冀鲁豫八专区研究办法
  　挖河疏水扩大种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】八专署成立治河委员会，大力组织群众挖河疏水。专署接到行署“挖河疏水扩大种麦面积”指示后，即于九月十四日召集濮阳、清丰、卫河、南乐四县有关人员开座谈会，研究挖河疏水扩大生产面积办法，经过分组详细研究，决议根据以下几个原则进行；第一、为了统一领导，统一步骤与行动，配合有关各县组织治河委员会；第二、确定清丰南疏马颊河廿五里，由濮阳负责疏通，清丰北疏通龙河四十五里，由清丰、卫河、南乐负责，争取二十号前动工，廿五号前完工；第三、节约开支，在不动用一粒边区粮原则下，由出夫村统一自备，以后由县、区斟酌情形统一调剂；第四、挖坏的路，由当地村负责修补，并迅即架桥。会议结束后，各县分别召开区村干部联席会，传达挖河疏水精神，各干部分头深入群众广泛的宣传动员，摸清群众历史上因疏河造成矛盾及目前群众对挖河的情绪，以便有重点的解疙瘩。经过两天的广泛宣传动员，群众对挖河工作亦有了进一步的认识。卫河五区宋村是历史的矛盾焦点村，因该村地势较高，濮河赵村坡的水若放入马颊河，必须挖通此地，因马颊河下游淤塞，畅流不下，容易出槽淹地，因此与河两岸村庄造成历史性的严重矛盾，这次治河时，该村指导员宋宏印同志，召开全村群众大会说：“按这次挖河的精神，保证了我们不能被淹，上级决不会打哭一个，引笑一个，挑了地上级想办法调剂，过去我们与赵村坡的矛盾，都是地主统治阶级造成的。”群众听了情绪很高，即紧张的行动起来。濮阳七区两千多农民半夜里赶着上工，全河线上一万多人，于九月二十日的上午，全体出马，打埝的打埝，挖泥的挖泥。赵村坡的积水疏出后，群众自动找对象，组织互助组抢着种麦，有的找银行贷款，赶快买牛，突击种麦。
