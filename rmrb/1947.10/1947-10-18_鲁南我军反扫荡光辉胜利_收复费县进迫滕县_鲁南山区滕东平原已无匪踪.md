Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 16th: Belated news: Over the past month, our Lunan army has victoriously smashed the Kuomintang army's "sweeping" operations in the Lunan mountainous area, forcing the enemy into a corner in the narrow areas of Yi (county), Zao (zhuang), Qu (fu), Si (shui) and on both sides of the Jinpu Railway. Our Lunan local armed forces blocked the enemy's "sweeping" operations against the Baodugu, Moshan, and Zousi mountainous areas, eliminating 1,171 enemies (including more than 430 captured alive). The enemy was forced to flee back to its original defense positions in disarray on the 28th of last month. Taking advantage of the victorious momentum of the counter-"sweeping" operations, our army continued to advance into the KMT-occupied areas. In the four days from the 26th to the 29th of last month, we successively recovered Feixian city and the important mountainous towns of Baiyan, Liangqiu, Chengqian, and Xiangcheng, an important stronghold of the enemy on the Tai (xianzhuang) and Wei (xian) roads. The defending enemy fled towards the Jinpu Railway and the direction of Yixian and Zaozhuang. Our army is currently pursuing them separately. The entire Lunan mountainous area has now been recovered by us.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 16th: Local armed forces in various parts of Shandong have repeatedly annihilated the KMT army. The Binbei local armed militia and work teams annihilated a total of 876 enemies (including 665 captured alive) in the twenty days from mid-September to the beginning of this month, captured five strongholds on the Zhu (cheng) Jiao (xian) highway, including Chaigou and Dawangjialou, and seized four vehicles. A unit of the Lunan Mainstay Regiment advanced into the Teng (xian) East Plain and successively captured and forced the retreat of seven strongholds including Shanxidian and Chengtou from the 2nd to the 7th, annihilating more than 300 enemies, and directly approaching the city of Tengxian. The entire Tengdong Plain has been recovered by us. A unit of the Jiaodong local armed forces attacked the KMT's "Returning Home Corps" villainous team in Gelin Village, Wulong (Xinxian), on the 3rd of this month, capturing all 71 of them alive, and handed over those with heinous crimes to the local masses for disposal. On the same night, a certain work team attacked the KMT army entrenched on Dongwangcun Island, Ji (mo), by boat, seizing 13 sailboats loaded with supplies. On the 30th of last month, a certain unit met the invading 74th Division's two battalions and more than 1,000 villainous "Returning Home Corps" from Jinkou (more than a hundred miles east of Jimo City), killing and wounding more than 200 of them.
