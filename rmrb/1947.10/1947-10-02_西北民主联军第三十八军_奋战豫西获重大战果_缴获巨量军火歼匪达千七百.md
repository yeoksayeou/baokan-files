　　Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 30th: The Northwest Democratic Allied Forces' 38th Army, under General Kong Congzhou, launched a counter-offensive southwards, inflicting heavy blows on the Chiang bandits. A portion of this army, in operations in the Shanxian and Gangxiang areas, liberated the Guanyintang, Zhangmao, Xiashi, and Yinghao stations in Shanxian County, and the Chousang station in Lingbao County, as well as the Dongdaying, Zhangcun, Caiyuan, Wangcun, and Zhangshafen Shishi towns. They coordinated with fraternal units to liberate the counties of Shanxian and Gangxiang. They killed and wounded over 500 enemies, captured 1,250 enemies below the rank of deputy regimental commander, for a total of 1,750. They seized 2 field guns, 1 infantry gun, 8 mortars and 60mm guns, 41 light and heavy machine guns, 930 rifles and pistols, 14 submachine guns, 4 grenade launchers, 640,000 rounds of ammunition, 20,000 jin of yellow explosives, over 20,000 artillery shells, 3 radio stations, 2 radios, 7 switchboards, over 30 telephones, 2 machine coal kilns, 1 ordnance repair shop, 2 generators, 1 automobile, 4 locomotives, 80 train cars, and countless other military supplies. During the counter-offensive, the army intensified its training, greatly improving its combat effectiveness. In the battle of Shanxian, one unit of the army captured over 700 enemies with only three wounded, creating an enemy elimination record of 130 to 1.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 30th: General Kong Congzhou's troops, amidst their busy military schedule, still helped the masses turn over a new leaf in the villages where they were stationed, winning the support of the masses in the new areas. On September 13th, the work team of this unit helped the masses in Yicun, where they were stationed, to hold a poor people's meeting. At the meeting, they publicized the land reform policy and resolutely supported the masses. The masses were in high spirits, shouting the slogan "The poor want to be the masters," and immediately conducted a grievance and revenge campaign against Ren Chongshou, a local tyrant landlord in the village. After the meeting, Ren Chongshou was detained. The next day, the masses in the neighboring village of Nangou also asked the work team to come and help them. After the work team arrived, the masses held a large meeting, struggled against the local tyrant landlord Ren Baoru, and planned to establish a "Peasant Turn-Over Association." During the election of the founding meeting, someone nominated Ren Dongru, who had previously served as a Bao head, but the masses immediately said: "We don't want anyone who has been a Bao head." Finally, ten group leaders were elected, nine of whom were poor peasants and hired laborers, and only one was a middle peasant. That night, another grievance meeting was held, and the masses from Taiyue Yicheng also rushed to participate and cheer them on. The masses finally executed Ren Baoru, the number one local tyrant landlord in the village, and distributed the fruits of the struggle according to their social class. On the 19th, a formal village government was established on the basis of the Turn-Over Committee. Ren Baocheng, who was extremely poor, was elected as the chairman of the Farmers' Association, Ren Zailu, a poor peasant, was the director of the Military Affairs Committee, and Ren Baijun, the original member of the Turn-Over Committee, was reassigned as the mobilization committee member. Ren Baodao, who had been framed by Ren Baoru for "colluding with the Eighth Route Army" and imprisoned in Shanxian County, had just come out of the Shanxian prison and was unanimously elected as the village head. From then on, the poor truly became the masters.
