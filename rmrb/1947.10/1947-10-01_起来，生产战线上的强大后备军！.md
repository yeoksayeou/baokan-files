　　Arise, a Powerful Reserve Force on the Production Front!
　　The seasons wait for no one. The Autumn Equinox has passed, and the Cold Dew is coming soon. Autumn harvesting in the mountains and wheat planting on the plains have reached a very urgent season. Although achievements have been made in rushing to harvest and plant in various places, these achievements still need to be expanded. How can we successfully complete this tense work in the future? The central issue is the total mobilization of all military personnel and civilians, and comprehensive organization. The abundant source of this organization is auxiliary labor, and the main force of auxiliary labor is working women.
　　The experience of several years has proven this point. Whenever there is a shortage of labor and production is tense, this powerful reserve force enthusiastically steps onto the production front and undertakes this glorious mission. According to statistics from Licheng last year, the number of women organized before autumn was 13,122, which increased to 18,822 after autumn. Last autumn, Pingshun organized 908 male semi-laborers, 350 auxiliary laborers, 111 female semi-laborers, and 271 auxiliary laborers. In the first half of this year, participation in battles was frequent, and this labor army played a decisive role. For example, when Heshun was rushing to plant, 11,000 people participated, accounting for 63% of the total labor force. As a result, 6,371 women, children, and old men all came out, sowing 400,000 mu in half a month, saving more than 70,000 workdays. In Zuoquan, the organization of auxiliary labor reached 78%, saving more than 10,000 workdays in half a month. At that time, the extreme shortage of labor made people doubt whether the cultivated land this year could be guaranteed to be fully sown. The Taihang Second Special Office was not sure and only proposed "striving not to leave land uncultivated." However, after this labor army appeared on the production front, it not only completed the planting task by 100%, what a great achievement this is! People who underestimate women's labor and shout empty slogans about labor shortages should correct their thinking.
　　"Spring is busy, autumn is busy, it is most shameful for young women not to participate in the autumn harvest!" Shexian put forward such slogans as "Men and women all go to the fields, old and young are not idle," "Do what you should do, do what you can do," and "Eight Immortals cross the sea, each showing their own unique abilities," to inspire their labor consciousness and give full play to their high initiative. Secondly, based on the principle of rewarding semi-auxiliary labor, those who participate in production should be encouraged and welcomed, and organize reasonable scoring and work recording to consolidate their enthusiasm. For example, Yuan Shuangxi, an old man from Zuoquan, said during the rush to plant: "Last year, labor was worth eight points, this year, plowing is worth ten points. I am getting older every year, but the points I earn are getting more and more every year!" For women, family dividends (20% or 30%) can be implemented based on specific circumstances.

### 起来，生产战线上的强大后备军！

　　起来，生产战线上的强大后备军！
    节令不等人，秋分已过，寒露即来，山地秋收与平原种麦已到万分紧迫的季节。各地在抢收抢种中，虽然已获成绩，但这些成绩仍需扩大，今后如何才能胜利完成这一紧张工作，中心问题是全体军民总动员，全面组织起来，而组织起来的雄厚源泉是辅助劳力，辅助劳力的主力军是劳动妇女。
    数年来的经验都证明了这个问题，越到劳力缺乏，生产紧张的时候，这支势力后备军，就踊跃的走上生产战线，担任起这个光荣的使命。据黎城去年统计秋前组织起来妇女一三一二二人，秋后增为一八八二二人，平顺去秋组织男半劳力九○八个，辅助劳力三五○个，女半劳力一一一一个，辅助劳力二七一个。今年上半年参战频繁，这支劳动大军起了决定性的作用。如和顺正当抢种之际参战去了一一○○○人，占劳力总数的百分之六十三，于是妇女儿童老汉六三七一人齐出动，半月下种四十万亩，省工七万余个，左权七区组织辅助劳力达百分之七十八，半月省工万余个，当时劳力之奇缺，使人怀疑到今年耕地有无保证全部下种之可能，太行二专署不敢肯定，只提出“争取不荒地”，但当这支劳动大军出现在生产前线之后，不仅是百分之百的完成了耕种任务，这是何等伟大的业绩，轻视妇女劳力，空喊劳力缺乏的人们，该纠正一下脑筋吧。
    “春忙秋忙，秀女只要不参加秋收最丢人！”涉县提出这样口号，“男女都上地，老少没闲人”，“该干啥干啥，会干啥干啥”，“八仙过海，各显神通”，启发她们的劳动自觉，发挥高度的积极性。其次要本着奖励半辅劳力的原则，参加生产的即加以鼓励与欢迎，组织起来合理评分记工，巩固他们的积极性，如左权原双喜老汉在抢种时说：“去年劳动顶八分，今年掌犁顶十分，岁数一年比一年老，顶分一年比一年多！”对于妇女可酌斟具体情形，实行家庭分红（二八或三七）。
