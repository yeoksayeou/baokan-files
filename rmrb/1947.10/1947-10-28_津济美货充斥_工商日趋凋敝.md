Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: According to the Tianjin Industry and Commerce Daily on the 25th of last month, industry and commerce in Tianjin are increasingly declining due to the influx of American goods and economic instability. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the number of factories and businesses announcing shutdowns has increased. In just ten days, more than 40 factories and businesses reported closures to the (Chiang Kai-shek) Social Affairs Bureau, including Dongfu Factory, Zhenya Factory, Zhenhua Chemical Industry Cooperative, Gongtong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Wenxing Coal Mine, Huawen Cloth Store, and Tiansheng Qingji Rice Mill. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities not only refused to provide appropriate relief but also, based on the so-called "Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During Extraordinary Periods," prohibited shutdowns, forcing them to be sacrificial victims of the economic collapse of the Four Big Families. The industrial and commercial sectors are filled with indignation. Another report: Jinan's leading and nationally renowned Renfeng Yarn Factory, due to the dumping of American goods, unbearable harsh taxes and levies by Chiang Kai-shek, and the devastation of bureaucratic capital, officially announced its closure on the 5th of this month. More than 12,000 employees are therefore plunged into the dire situation of unemployment. The Chiang Kai-shek mouthpiece, the Shandong "Xinbao" (New News), lamented on the 6th: "Jinan's industry and commerce are facing a crisis."

    津济美货充斥
    工商日趋凋敝
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据天津工商日报上月二十五日讯：津市工商各业，因受美货充斥，经济不稳等影响，业务日趋凋敝。中秋节前后，宣告停工歇业者益形增多，仅旬日内呈报（蒋匪）社会局停歇之工厂商号即有东孚工厂、震亚工厂、振华化学工业社、共同漂染织工厂、文兴煤厂、华文布庄、天生庆记米厂等四十余家。蒋匪当局不但拒予适当救济，反根据所谓“非常时期农矿工商管理条例”，禁止停工歇业，强迫为四大家族之经济崩溃当牺牲品，工商界均愤慨万分。另息：济南首屈一指全国著名之仁丰纱厂亦因美货倾销，不堪蒋匪苛杂勒索与官僚资本之摧残，于本月五日正式宣布停工，一万二千余职工均因此陷入失业惨境，蒋匪机关报山东“新报”六日哀鸣：“济市工商业正面临着危机”。
