Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. The successive victories of the People's Liberation Army's great counter-offensive have compelled Shanghai newspapers and public opinion to make some disclosures, greatly encouraging the rising anti-Chiang and anti-American movement among the people in the Chiang-controlled areas. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Shanghai is attempting to restore censorship in order to conceal the truth of Chiang's disastrous defeat. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the United Press on the 29th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Shanghai is currently "considering" restoring the censorship system to prevent newspapers from publishing news that "praises the bandit army" (referring to the People's Liberation Army), "damages friendly relations between China and other countries" (referring to the American imperialists), and "slanders the leader" (referring to opposing the traitor Chiang Kai-shek). (Note: Since the Wenhui and Lianhe newspapers were shut down, almost all newspapers in Shanghai are controlled by the Chiang bandits, but the fact that the Chiang bandits still want to restore censorship at this time shows the extent of their fear and panic.)

　　害怕人民反蒋运动高涨
  　蒋图恢复新闻检查
    【新华社陕北一日电】人民解放军大反攻的节节胜利，迫使上海报纸舆论不得不作若干透露，使日益高涨中的蒋区人民反蒋反美运动获得极大鼓舞。上海蒋家匪帮乃企图恢复新闻检查，以掩饰蒋匪惨败真象。据合众社二十九日沪电透露：上海蒋家匪帮现正“考虑”恢复新闻检查制度，以阻止各报发表“赞扬匪军”（指人民解放军）消息“破坏中国与其他国家（指美帝国主义者）友谊关系”，“诽谤领袖（指反对卖国贼蒋介石）等新闻。（按自文汇、联合等报被封闭后，上海各报几尽为蒋匪控制，但目前蒋匪还要恢复新闻检查，足见其恐惧慌张到何等程底。）
