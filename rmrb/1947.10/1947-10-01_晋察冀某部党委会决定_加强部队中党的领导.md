Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 29th: The Party Committee of a certain unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army has recently issued a decision to strengthen the absolute leadership of the Party in the troops, believing that strengthening the Party's leadership is the center of all current military and political work. The decision first points out that the unit has made great progress in combat, Party building, and army building in the past year, but the implementation of the Party's unified leadership and the study of Chairman Mao's military thought are still insufficient. There are weaknesses in all tasks, resulting in remaining vestiges of sectarianism and a rather strong tendency towards liberalism. Military skills have also failed to improve. Therefore, it is specifically stipulated that: (1) Party committees at all levels and every Party member must clearly recognize the absolute leadership of the Party over the troops ideologically. Party committees at all levels should truly become the core of all leadership and unity in the troops. Party committees and Party members should strengthen their Party spirit and class viewpoint; strengthen their viewpoint of fighting for the motherland, for the people, against imperialism and feudalism, and for defeating the American Chiang Kai-shek forces; strengthen the viewpoint of seeking truth from facts; and strengthen the overall concept of unity and obedience to the whole. (2) Improve the Party's organization and work at all levels. Conscientiously implement democratic centralism, regularly discuss and decide on policies related to combat, education (training), and other major policies such as the transfer of cadres and financial expenditures. Regularly deploy and inspect military and political work. The implementation of the Party Committee's decisions should be through the chief officer system. (3) Strengthen the leadership role of the company branch. Determine the company's branch committee as the highest leader of the entire company and also as the core of internal and external unity of the entire company. The overall military and political work of the company must be discussed and decided by the branch committee, and the company commander and company political instructor must implement it and report to the branch committee. The branch should mobilize Party members to take the lead in the masses to actively complete combat, political, economic, and other tasks, and play a leading role in opposing bad tendencies. However, the branch should avoid making administrative interventions in all administrative affairs of the company. The branch committee is elected by all Party members in the company, and the branch secretary is elected by the branch committee members. The opinions of non-Party comrades should be solicited when developing Party members, and elements opposed by the masses should not be absorbed. General group and branch meetings can include non-Party comrades. Achieve Party leadership through uniting and cherishing non-Party comrades.

　　晋察冀某部党委会决定
  　加强部队中党的领导
    【新华社晋察冀二十九日电】晋察冀解放军某部党委会，顷发布加强党在部队中绝对领导的决定。认为：加强党的领导为目前一切军政工作的中心。该决定首指出该部一年来作战建党建军均有大进步，但贯澈党的一元化领导与学习毛主席军事思想仍是不够，各项工作均有弱点，致仍有山头主义等思想残余，而自由主义思想则相当浓厚，军事素养亦未能提高。为此特规定：（一）各级党委与每个党员思想上须明确认识党对部队的绝对领导作用，各级党委应该真正成为部队中一切领导和团结的核心。党委与党员均应增强党性与阶级观点；增强为祖国为人民为反帝反封建与为战胜美蒋战斗的观点；加强实事求是的观点；加强团结与服从全体的整体观念。（二）健全各级党的组织与工作。认真实行民主集中制，定期讨论决定有关作战、教育（训练）等政策，与调动干部、财政开支等大政方针。定期布置与检查军政工作。党委决定的执行应通过首长制。（三）加强连队支部领导作用，确定连的支委会为全连最高领导，亦为全连内外团结的核心。连的全盘工作军政工作均须经支委会讨论决定，连长、连指必须执行并向支委会作报告。支部应发动党员带头群众积极完成战斗、政治、经济等任务，并在反对不良倾向中起带头作用，但支部对连队一切行政事务应避免作事务性的干涉。支委会由全连党员选举，支书由支委推定，发展党员应征求非党同志意见，不吸收群众反对的分子。一般性的小组与支部大会可吸收非党同志参加。从团结与爱护非党同志中实现党的领导。
