　　If the Heavens Can Freeze Early, We Can Plow Early
    [Report from this newspaper in Huguan] After the publicity campaign in the Nanzhuang area of the Third District, each village recalled whether this year's autumn harvest came easily or not, calculated the seasons and strength, calculated the autumn plowing, grasped the proactive requirements of "men not forgetting autumn plowing, women not forgetting night spinning," and broke through the paralysis and complacency of some of the masses. All twelve villages in the area, except for Jiaoli, closely combined autumn plowing with the autumn harvest. The slogan put forward by everyone was: "If the heavens can freeze early, we can plow early. Early work benefits, late work suffers. If you fall behind one step, you fall behind every step. Autumn plowing freezes the insects to death, ensuring increased grain next year." Qinjiachuang had no organization for a year. This year's autumn harvest, under the encouragement of the counter-offensive and autumn harvest mobilization, also voluntarily combined into five groups. They completed the rush harvest in about ten days, and began autumn plowing on August 27th. They have now plowed more than 150 mu. Guan Zhang has 320 mu of autumn land, and six head of livestock have plowed more than 110 mu. They plan to complete everything by the 17th. The cadres in the entire area are in high spirits, and everyone is proposing: "As long as we work hard, we are not afraid of difficulties." According to statistics from the sixth day of the lunar month, the entire area has 8,466 mu of autumn land and 163 head of livestock. 2,196 mu have already been plowed. Under the leadership of heroic cadres, Cheyi Village has plowed half of its autumn land. When discussing how to complete autumn plowing ahead of schedule, each village automatically put forward challenges, guaranteeing that they would complete autumn plowing before the 20th, and researched plowing shady land first, then sunny land. Grinding and other miscellaneous work will not use livestock at all. Increase efforts to rush autumn plowing and strive for a final struggle against the ground freezing. (Ru Long, Wu Xing, Shu Ze)

　　天能早冻  咱能早耕
    【本报壶关讯】三区南庄小区各村经过宣传大反攻，回忆今年的秋来得容易不容易，算节令算力量，算秋耕，抓住“男人不忘秋垡地，女人不忘夜纺花”的积极要求，打破部分群众的麻痹自满，全小区十二个村除郊里外，在秋收中都紧紧结合了秋耕，大家提出的口号是：“天能早冻，咱能早耕，早干沾光，迟干受伤，一步赶不上，步步赶不上，秋天垡地冻死虫，明年增粮有保证。”秦家庄一年来没有组织，今年秋收在反攻鼓舞及秋收动员下，也自愿结合起五个组来，十天左右完成了抢收，八月二十七即开始了秋耕，现已耕一百五十余亩。管掌的秋地三百二十亩，六犋牲口已耕一百一十余亩，计划十七日全部完成。全小区干部情绪很高，大家提出：“只要努力干，就不怕困难。”全小区初六统计，秋地八千四百六十六亩，一百六十三犋牲口，已耕二千一百九十六亩，车易村在干部英雄领导下，秋地已耕一半。在讨论如何提前完成秋耕时，各村都自动提出了挑战，保证二十日前完成秋耕，并研究先犁背阴地，后犁向阳地。推碾杂活完全不用牲口，加起劲来突击秋耕，争取向地冻做最后斗争。（如龙、武兴、书则）
