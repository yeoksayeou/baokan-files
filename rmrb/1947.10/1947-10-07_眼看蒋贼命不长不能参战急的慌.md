　　Seeing that the bandit Chiang's life is short, he is panicking because he cannot participate in the war
　　[Reported from Lucheng by our newspaper] Xin Wu, director of the Propaganda Committee of the Fourth District River, convened a meeting of the militia self-defense force overnight after returning to the village from a district meeting. First, he discussed the current victory news. Everyone said, "The old bandit Chiang Kai-shek's life is short!" Everyone said, "Our strength is really great! We will voluntarily participate in the war this time!" After the propaganda, thirteen young adults voluntarily signed up on the spot. Wang Xiaosi said: "Now that I have turned over, I am willing to participate in the war. Farmers all over the world are one family, and we must help the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to turn over!" Miao Longhu said: "It is not only for the liberation of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, but also to protect our own fruits. I am going willingly and sincerely. I will never come back until old Chiang is defeated!" Liu Jixian proposed: "Not only do I want to go first, but I also want to guarantee three conditions: 1. Do not violate mass discipline, 2. Do not desert halfway, 3. Obey the leadership of the superiors at all times." Because the district headquarters decided that the village would only send five people this time, the village cadres left eight people at home to continue production based on the actual situation of their families. Later, the eight of them found the headquarters and threw a tantrum: Why did you reduce us? After the cadres explained again and again, they finally proposed: If we can't go this time, we will definitely go next time! (Hong Tai)

　　眼看蒋贼命不长不能参战急的慌
    【本报潞城讯】四区河宣武委会主任新午同志由区开会回村后，连夜召开民兵自卫队会议，首先将当前胜利消息谈论，大家纷纷说：“蒋介石老贼命不长了！”大家都说：“咱们力量真大呀，咱们这次参战自动去！”经过宣传，当场有十三个青壮年自动报名，王小四说：“我现在翻了身，我情愿去参战，天下农民是一家，要帮助蒋管区老百姓翻身！”苗龙虎说：“不但光是为了解放蒋管区老百姓，也是保护咱们自己果实，我去是真心实愿，打不倒老蒋我永不回来！”刘计先提出：“不但我要先去，我还要保证三个条件：一、不违犯群众纪律，二、不半路开小差，三、时时刻刻要服从上级领导。”因区指挥部这次决定该村只去五个人，村干部根据家中实际情况，留下了八个人在家继续生产，后来他们八个人找到指挥部发了一顿脾气：为什么把我们减下来？经过干部再三解释，最后他们提出：这次去不了下次一定去！（宏太）
