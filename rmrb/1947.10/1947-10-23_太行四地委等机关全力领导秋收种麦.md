　　Taihang Fourth Prefectural Committee and Other Organs Fully Lead the Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting
    [Our Taihang News] Since the beginning of autumn, the Fourth Sub-region has experienced continuous autumn rains, which have not only led to a poor autumn harvest but have also affected the time for autumn harvesting and wheat planting. In addition, the enemy's looting of the autumn harvest has made the masses feel the urgency of autumn harvesting and wheat planting. In order to meet the demands of the masses, the various organs of the sub-region have concentrated their efforts to support the masses in the autumn harvest and to eliminate wasteland for wheat planting. On October 10th, the Commissioner's Office issued a proclamation on eliminating wasteland for wheat planting, specifically stipulating measures to reward the elimination of wasteland for wheat planting. The Hebei-Henan Bank, during the movement to eliminate wasteland for wheat planting, decided to issue 20 million yuan in loans to poor and hired peasants to solve the difficulties of agricultural tools and livestock. The sub-region's trade company, in order to take care of the difficulties of poor and hired peasants in planting wheat, sold 600 shi of grain to basic masses at a price 20% lower than the market price. The Fourth Prefectural Committee, the Headquarters, and the Sub-military district all gave instructions to various counties, requiring responsible comrades and all cadres at all levels to personally and actively participate in the leadership of the wasteland elimination and wheat planting movement, and to use armed forces to support the autumn harvest and wasteland elimination and wheat planting movement in the border areas. On October 10th, the Prefectural Committee, the Commissioner's Office, and eight other directly subordinate units organized 56 comrades to go directly into the villages to organize the masses' autumn harvest and wasteland elimination and wheat planting movement.
