　　I Have Awakened
    Miáo Yě
    (Report of Self-Reflection After Three Examinations)

    Comrade Meng Jun is a comrade who has undergone more than ten years of revolutionary training. However, due to his landlord family background, he has not completely separated himself from the landlord class ideologically, resulting in many thoughts and behaviors that betray the people. During this re-examination, after several days of painful internal struggle, he swore to the Party and the people to completely eliminate landlord ideology. The following is his self-reflection:

    I. Interfering in Mass Struggles and Attacking Village Cadres:

    Last year, when I was working in the 4th Battalion of the Military Academy and living in Kangcheng, I saw the mass struggle and the beating of the big local tyrant, and I felt very disapproving. I thought to myself, "The landlord is out of luck now." I wanted to interfere in the mass movement and said to the village cadres, "You can beat him, but don't beat him here, it might affect the morale of the military officers." I said it twice, but the villagers said no. I then asked the quartermaster to interfere, but it didn't work either. I said, "The common people are simply outrageous!"

    Later, when the masses were struggling against the son of a local tyrant, I again asked the quartermaster to interfere. The quartermaster went to the village chief and said, "It is illegal to beat someone to death." The village cadre said, "The masses want to beat him, they just want to beat him!" The quartermaster said, "The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are not allowed to beat people." The village cadre said, "We are not the Communist Party or the Eighth Route Army, we are the common people." Later, the yelling became fierce, and the village cadre detained the quartermaster. Seeing that the situation was not good, I apologized to them on the surface, and they released him.

    II. Running Around for Class Enemies

    When I was in Jiaozuo, I heard that a wealthy man named Zhao was still around. He was the richest man in the county, and I used to study at the school he ran. So I went to find him, fantasizing that he would help me financially. I found his business and told the clerk that I was looking for him. He didn't come out the first time, but he came out to see me the second time. I thought that the meeting would be very warm, but he was only reluctant and talked to me coldly. I thought he would definitely invite me in for a meal and tea, but he stood on the steps and didn't let me in at all. I asked him how his family was doing. He said, "I heard that the county government is going to confiscate my property, saying that I am a traitor." I thought, "Such a 'good person', damn it, is being treated as a traitor!" I wanted to show off and go to the municipal government to ask about it. When I met the secretary of the municipal government, I said how good Mr. Zhao was and that he shouldn't be struggled against. The secretary said, "You haven't been back for seven or eight years, you don't understand his situation, you can investigate more." I ridiculed him, saying, "No need to investigate, I already know clearly!"

    I lost my stance and became a loyal running dog of the landlord class. When people treated me as an enemy, unwilling to come out to see me, and dealt with me coldly, I still went to run around for him!

    III. Afraid of Struggle Coming to My Door, Afraid to Hear of My Hometown Being Liberated.

    The first time I went through the Three Examinations, I heard that my hometown had been liberated. I was very happy at first, but then I immediately thought of my home. I thought, "This time the struggle will come to my head, my father and mother will also be struggled against, maybe they will be beaten..." I became sad and cried for half the night. The next day I was unhappy all day, and I couldn't continue writing my self-reflection, especially when it came to accusing my family of their crimes to the democratic government. I couldn't make up my mind. I just wrote a letter to the government and then tore it up myself. I thought, "My family may not be landlords, what am I accusing them of?"

    Later, I saw in the newspaper that our army had withdrawn from my county again. I said on the surface that we were "not concerned with the gains and losses of one city or one place," but in my heart I thought, "Good, this way my family will be struggled against later. When I am close to home in the future, when it is liberated, I can go back and take care of them." I didn't think that one city, one day not liberated, means that countless poor people are suffering there! I am sorry to the Party, I am sorry to the people!

    IV. Still Treating the Enemy as My Father!

    I went home once last year. The purpose at the time was to sell the land at home, turn it into money and deposit it in the bank, and move my father and others to the liberated area, so that they could avoid struggle and live without working. After arriving at the county government, I asked a relative to call my father, but my father didn't come out. He heard that the Eighth Route Army advocated struggle and scolded me for half the night, saying, "Having a son like you is worse than not having one!" My mother also said, "We have four sons, we don't need one less!" They didn't want me and wouldn't come to see me. There was no way. I took 20,000 Guan Jin from my uncle's house. My father heard about it and found the place where I was staying the next day. He opened his mouth and asked me for the 20,000 yuan, and said that he wouldn't let me leave anyway. I said, "I won't give you the money, I'm still leaving," and pushed him away. He said, "Fine, from now on, you are not my son, and I am not your father. I have four sons, I'll just pretend that one of you is dead!"

    He already treats me as an enemy, doesn't come to see me, only comes to ask for money, but I still recognize the enemy as my father. People already don't acknowledge that I am his son, but I still want to be their son! Now I am awakened. It was wrong for me to ask my family for 20,000 Guan Jin. I asked them for money, and that money was taken from the peasants. Now I want to take that 20,000 yuan and return it to the peasants. In addition, I have also realized clearly that they are my class enemies, not my parents!

    V. Atoning for Sins to the Party, Swearing to the Party!

    I think that my countless connections with the landlord family are basically because I have not eliminated landlord ideology and have not abandoned the landlord's position. This time, in examining my thoughts, the Party saved me. I have been cultivated by the Party for more than ten years, but I am still standing on the landlord's position. Why am I so unaware? Why do I recognize the enemy as my father? In my work, I have not made contributions to the Party, but have committed crimes. I want to atone for my sins to the Party and the people. I am sorry to the Party, I am sorry to the people. Today, I swear before the Party:

    (1) From now on, I will resolutely break with the landlord family and sever all ties forever. I do not recognize them as my parents and siblings. They are my enemies.

    (2) I will return the 20,000 yuan I took from my family to the peasants.

    (3) I will accuse the reactionary family of their crimes to our People's Government.

    (4) I will sincerely surrender to the working masses and the proletariat, and abandon the reactionary landlord position.

    (5) I will forever stand on the side of the people and become a new Communist Party member again.

    (6) I will make contributions to the Party and the people while bearing my sins.

　　我觉悟了
    描野
    （三查反省报告）
    孟钧同志是一个经过十多年革命锻炼的同志，但由于出身地主家庭，在思想上和地主阶级没有完全分家，以致有着许多背叛人民的思想和行为，这次复查中，经过几天沉痛的内心斗争，他向党、向人民宣誓，要把地主思想完全清除掉，下面就是他的反省：
    一、干涉群众斗争，打击村干：
    去年我在军官四大队工作，住在康城，看见群众斗争，打大恶霸，觉得很不以为然，心里想：“地主到这时候倒了霉了。”我就要来干涉群运，向村干部说：“你打是可以的，但不要在这里打，恐怕会影响军官情绪。”说了两次，老乡说不行，我又叫事务长去干涉，更不中，我说：“老百姓简直不得了了！”
    后来群众斗争一个恶霸的儿子，我又叫事务长去干涉。事务长去向村长说：“打死人是不合法的。”村干说：“群众要打，就是要打！”事务长说：“共产党、八路军，是不准打人的。”村干说：“我们不是共产党八路军，我们是老百姓。”后来叫得凶了，村干就把事务长扣起来，我看不妙，表面上向人家道了歉，才放回来。
    二、为阶级敌人奔忙
    在焦作的时候，打听到一个姓赵的老财还在，他是该县的首富，我过去在他办的学校里上过学，于是就去找找他，幻想他对我经济上有所帮助。我找到他的生意，向伙计说明来找他，第一次他没有出来，第二次才出来见我，满以为见面会是很热情的，那知他只是勉强的，冷淡的和我谈了几句。原来我想，他一定请我进去吃饭喝茶，那知他站在阶台上根本没让我进去。我问他家里怎样，他说：“听说县政府要没收我的财产了，说我是汉奸。”我想，“这样一个‘好人’，他妈的，就当汉奸办哩！”就想露一鼻子，到市政府去问问，见了市政府的秘书，我说的姓赵如何好，不应该斗，人家说：“你七八年没回来，不了解他的情况，可以再多调查调查”。我把他讽刺了一顿，说：“不用调查，我已经清楚了！”
    我失掉了立场，当了地主阶级的忠实走狗，在人家把我当敌人看待，不愿出来见我，冷淡的应付我时，我还去为他奔忙！
    三、为使斗争不临门，怕听故乡被解放。
    第一次三查的时候，听说家乡被解放了，心里很高兴，但马上又想到自己的家，心里想：“这回斗争可要到我头上了，父亲母亲也要被斗，也许会挨打……”伤心起来，哭了半夜。第二天整天不高兴，反省再也写不下去，特别是写到要向民主政府控告家庭罪恶时，下不了决心，刚向政府写了信，自己又撕了，心里想：“我家里也不一定是地主，控告什么？”
    后来见报上登出咱们军队又撤出我县了，我嘴上说咱们是“不计较一城一地的得失，”心里想：“好，这样家里就可晚些被斗了，到将来我离家近时，解放了，我好回去照顾。”我没有想到一个城一天不解放，不知有多少穷人在那里受苦！我对不起党，对不起人民！
    四、还把敌人当父亲！
    去年回家去了一次，当时的目的是想把家里的地卖了，弄成钱存在银行里，把父亲等搬到解放区，又可躲避斗争，又可不劳动而生活。到县政府后，托一个亲戚叫我父亲，可是父亲不出来，他听说八路军主张斗争，把我骂了半夜，说：“要了我这个儿还不如不要！”母亲也说：“四个儿子，少他一个没关系！”打算不要我了，不来见我，没办法。我到舅父家拿了二万关金，父亲听说了，第二天他就找到我住的地方，开口就向我要那两万块钱，并且说反正不叫我走了。我说：钱我是不给你了，走，我还是要走，把他推开。他说：“好，从此以后，你也不是我的儿子，我也不是你的父亲，我四个儿子，就当死了你一个！”
    他已经把我当成敌人了，不来见我，赶来只是为了要钱，而我却还认敌作父。人家已经不承认我是他的儿子，自己却还要当人家的儿子！现在我觉悟了，我向家里要了二万元关金是不对的，我向他们要了钱，而那钱是从农民身上剥削来的，我现在要将那两万元拿出来交还给农民，此外，我也算认识清楚了，他们是我的阶级敌人，不是父母！
    五、向党赎罪，向党宣誓！
    我想我对地主家庭千丝万缕的关系，基本上就是一个地主思想没有清除，地主立场没有放弃，这次检查思想，党把我救了起来，受党的培养十来年了，我还是站在地主立场上，我为什么这样不自觉？这样认贼作父？在工作中我没有为党立功，而是有罪，我要向党、向人民赎罪，我对不起党，对不起人民。今天我在党的面前宣誓：
    （一）从此坚决与地主家庭一刀两断，永远脱离关系，不承认他们是我的父母兄弟，他们是我的敌人。
    （二）把从家里拿来的两万元归还农民。
    （三）向咱们人民政府，控告反动家庭的罪恶。
    （四）心悦诚服的向劳苦大众，无产阶级投降，脱离反动地主立场。
    （五）永远站在人民的立场上，再作一个新的共产党员。
    （六）带罪为党为人民立功。
