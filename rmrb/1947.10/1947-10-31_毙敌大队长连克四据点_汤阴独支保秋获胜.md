　　Battalion Commander Kills Enemies, Conquers Four Strongholds
　　Tangyin Independent Detachment Wins Autumn Harvest Protection
　　[Report from this newspaper in Tangyin] In order to protect the autumn harvest and the fields, and to crush the enemy's plan of encroachment, the Tangyin Independent Detachment organized a victorious pursuit and annihilation battle. At dawn on the 18th of this month, our Independent Detachment, combined with the militia of the Fifth and Seventh Districts, occupied Liyumiao Ridge, Xiaohetun, and other places in three routes. After the enemy's morning exercise, they went to the Xiaohetun ridge to stand guard. They came into contact with the militia of the Fifth District. Seeing us retreat, they launched a fierce attack on the left side of the Independent Detachment at Liyu Ridge. When the enemy approached grenade range, the Independent Detachment commander's grenade blossomed on the head of the big traitor Li Duoshan. Li Duoshan fell to the ground in response. We launched a fierce counter-charge. The Independent Detachment's commander, Pei Zhengzhi, led a part of the team to charge from the enemy's side. Seeing the fierce attack of our army, the enemy abandoned their corpses and fled. The remnants fled to Shuimowan. Our army pursued directly to the edge of Shuimowan village. The four strongholds of Nanbeiliyu, Xiaohetun, and Longhu were recovered by us. After clearing the battlefield, the Independent Detachment captured seven enemies and twenty members of the reactionary I-Kuan-Tao sect, killing and wounding a total of fourteen enemy members and sect members. We seized one enemy rifle, ten crutch guns, as well as bicycles, briefcases, bullets, and red-tasseled spears. Our Independent Detachment suffered no casualties. The morale of the masses and soldiers was extremely high. After the four strongholds of Liyu and others were recovered by us, a mass meeting was held immediately. When the masses saw the corpse of the bandit leader Li Duoshan, they applauded and laughed, saying: This has eliminated the great scourge of Liyu. An old man said: "You have all made great contributions." The bandit leader Li Duoshan was killed by a grenade thrown by Sun Baoping, the commander of our Independent Detachment. The county command has specially awarded Comrade Sun Baoping a major merit and awarded the Independent Detachment 20,000 yuan and the militia of the Fifth and Seventh Districts 10,000 yuan. (Forward Command, Zhang Shenzhi)
