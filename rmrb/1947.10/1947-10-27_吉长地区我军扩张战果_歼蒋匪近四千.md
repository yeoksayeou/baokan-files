Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th (Delayed Dispatch): In recent days, our army has expanded its victories in the Jilin-Changchun area, eliminating and capturing over 3,800 Chiang Kai-shek bandits, killing or capturing 15 enemy officers above the battalion commander level, and recovering the cities of Nongan and Jiutai, as well as many strongholds and stations on the outskirts of Jilin, such as Qipan Street, Wula Street, Kouqian, Jiuzhan, Huapi Factory, and Xiyang. On the night of the 15th, in the Yujialinzi area, 10 miles west of Changchun Airport, we annihilated a platoon of the 30th Division of the enemy's New First Army. On the 16th, in the Majia Shaokou area, 40 miles northwest of Changchun, we annihilated a unit of enemy cavalry. On the 17th, we repelled four trainloads of enemy reinforcements advancing eastward from Changchun at Baiqibao, northwest of Changchun. On the Jilin front, on the 17th and 18th, we fought on the south, north, and west sides of Jilin, successively annihilating units of the enemy's Provisional 52nd Division and 172nd Division, as well as the Yongji Brigade of the Second Assault Column, at Qipan Street, Wula Street, Huapi Factory, and Xiyang. At Kouqian Station, we annihilated the infantry battalion, logistics battalion, and engineering battalion of the 545th Regiment of the 182nd Division of the enemy's 60th Army. We also annihilated a company of the same regiment at Guanma Mountain, south of Jilin. According to statistics of various battles (reports on the recovery of Jiutai and Nongan have already been made), a total of over 680 enemy personnel, including enemy battalion commander Yu Mingtao and large-unit commander Chen Wei, were killed or wounded, and over 3,100 enemy personnel were captured, including Xiang Chengxin, Major General Commander of the Second Assault Column, Chen Jingwei, Deputy Commander, Jing Yuanshan, Lieutenant Colonel Chief of Staff, Zhu Yuanliang, Major Battalion Commander, Li Youmin, Chen Xiaohua, Deputy Regiment Commander, Zhao Baizhao, Regiment Commander of the newly formed First Regiment of the 172nd Division, and six deputy battalion commanders. We seized 22 artillery pieces of various types, 53 light and heavy machine guns, over 2,300 long and short guns, 130,000 rounds of ammunition, and four vehicles.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 25th: Our correspondent Hua Shan reported on the battle outside Jilin, saying: "Grab them tightly, knock them down and beat them" was the characteristic of this victory. Democratic Alliance soldiers who participated in this battle commented on Chiang Kai-shek's "key defense" by saying: Chen Cheng ran away even faster than Du Yuming, only to encounter our long-legged generals and iron-footed heroes, who surrounded the enemy before they could escape. On the morning of the 17th, our army sent surprise troops to simultaneously encircle the enemy strongholds outside Jilin. The soldiers sent by the enemy guarding Kouqian Station to the surrounding villages to urge the making of adobe for construction and to purchase supplies had already become prisoners. The enemy on the street were still shouting "One, two, three, four" on the parade ground. Only when they saw our army streaming across the railway did they urgently assemble and go up the mountain, and many people entered the bunkers without taking their ammunition bags. The defending enemy was the 1st Battalion of the 55th Regiment of the 182nd Division, along with the engineering battalion and transport battalion directly under the division headquarters, totaling 1,700 men. The three battalion commanders were unable to unify command, so they had to call the Jilin Division Headquarters for instructions, but the telephone lines had already been cut. At this time, there was no way to contact between the various hilltops, and only the rumbling of artillery fire could be heard from Wula Street and Jiuzhan. On our side, the reporter followed the army forward for 150 miles and did not see anyone lagging behind. When the defending enemy fired a warning shot, the soldiers said, "As soon as we hear the sound of a machine gun, we feel energetic all over." They immediately forgot their 18 hours of fatigue and rushed into battle. The only company that had not yet performed meritorious service attacked even more bravely. The Sun Lijun platoon, which captured eight hilltops in a row, was precisely the "Consolidated Friendly Model Platoon" of that company, with no one lagging behind or losing strength. At noon on the 18th, after the defending enemy was driven down the mountain from the commanding height of Beishan by our army, they still wanted to break through across the road, but the Yunnan soldiers who had been longing for home for a long time were unwilling to fight anymore. Our army fired a burst of machine-gun fire head-on, and thousands of people immediately scattered across the field. When the reporter went to the commanding height of Nanshan with a heavy machine gun, the sound of shouting for surrender was rolling towards Kouqian Street from all directions. When the reporter took a shortcut into the street, the enemy major battalion commander was already sitting at the entrance of his original battalion department talking to our army about his feelings about being captured. Also captured at the same time were Zhang Shixun, Lieutenant Colonel Transport Battalion Commander, Liu Siyuan, Major Engineering Battalion Commander, and all the officers and soldiers under his command. It took them less than half an hour from breaking out to being completely annihilated.

    吉长地区我军扩张战果
    歼蒋匪近四千
    【新华社东北二十日电】（迟到）吉长地区连日扩张战果，歼俘蒋匪三千八百余，毙伤俘敌营长以上军官十五名，收复农安、九台两城，及吉林外围之棋盘街、乌拉街、口前、九站、桦皮厂、西阳等据点车站多处。长春方面十五日夜在飞机场以西十里之于家林子歼匪新一军三十师一个排，十六日于长春西北四十里之马家哨口歼敌骑一部。十七日又在长春西北之白旗堡击退由长春向东增援之火车四辆。吉林方面，十七、十八两日在吉林南、北、西三面作战，先后于棋盘街、乌拉街、桦皮厂、西阳等处歼匪暂五十二师一七二师各一部，及突击第二总队永吉大队等部，于口前车站歼匪六十军一八二师五四五团步兵营、辎重营、工兵营各一，又在吉林以南关马山歼灭该团一个连，各次战果统计（收复九台、农安战果已报导）共毙伤匪营长于明韬大队长陈卫等以下六百八十余名，俘匪突击队第二总队少将指挥项成信、副总指挥陈径韦、中校参谋长井元善、少校大队长朱元良、李佑民、副团长陈小华、一七二师新编第一团团长赵白昭、正副营长六名以下三千一百余名。缴获各种炮二十二门，轻重机枪五十三挺，长短枪二千三百余支，子弹十三万发，汽车四部。
    【新华社东北前线二十五日电】本社记者华山报导吉林外围之战称：“一把揪住，按倒就打”，是这次获胜的特点。参加这次战斗的民主联军战士评论蒋匪“重点防御”时也说：陈诚比杜聿明逃的更快，偏偏遇着咱们这些长腿将军、铁脚英雄，没等敌人逃跑就围上来了。十七日晨我军出奇兵同时包围吉林外围各据点，口前车站守敌派到四乡催土坯筑工事和采买的士兵已经当了俘虏，街上守敌还在操场上喊着“一，二，三，四。”等看见我军从铁路上川流而过时，才紧急集合上山，好些人没有拿子弹袋就钻进碉堡里。守敌是一八二师五十五团一营，师部直属工兵营和输送营共一千七百人。三个营长无人统一指挥，只好打电话向吉林师部请示，可是电话线却早已被切断。这时各个山头间也无法联系了，只听到乌拉街和九站方面传来的隆隆炮声。在我军方面，记者随军前进一百五十里，看不到一个掉队的，当守敌鸣枪报警的时候，战士们都说：“一听机枪声，浑身又来劲了。”他们顿时忘了十八个小时的疲劳，争先投入战斗，唯一没有立过功的连队更加勇猛攻击，连夺八座山头的孙立俊排，正是该连无掉队无减员的“巩固友爱模范排。”十八日中午，守敌被我从北山制高点打下山来后，还想越路突围，但是思乡已久的云南士兵不愿再打了。我军迎面一梭子机枪，成千人就立刻遍野的溃散了。记者跟一挺重机枪上南山制高点时，喊缴枪的声音正从四面滚向口前街上。记者抄小道进街时，敌少校营长已经坐在他原来的营部门口跟我军谈起他的被俘感想，同时被俘的还有中校输送营长张士勋、少校工兵营长刘思远和他手下的全部官兵，他们从突围到全部被歼尚不及半小时。
