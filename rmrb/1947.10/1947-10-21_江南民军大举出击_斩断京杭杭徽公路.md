　　Jiangnan People's Army Launches Major Offensive
　　Cuts off Nanjing-Hangzhou and Hangzhou-Huizhou Highways
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th] To coordinate with the counter-offensive of our Southern Front Army, the powerful Jiangnan People's Guerrilla Force has launched a major offensive near the heartland of the Chiang bandit gang. According to a Nanjing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 16th: The People's Army in the Tianmu Mountain area of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui border region has set out in two routes. One route marched north, directly attacking the Nanjing-Hangzhou highway between Liyang and Yixing in Jiangsu Province and Changxing in Zhejiang Province; the other route swung south, directly towards the Hangzhou-Huizhou (i.e., She County) highway, achieving complete victory in both cases. Both of these major transportation arteries of the Chiang bandit gang have been cut off by the People's Army.
