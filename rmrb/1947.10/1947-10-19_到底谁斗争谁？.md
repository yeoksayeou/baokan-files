　　Who is fighting whom?
　　Editor:
　　Zhao Guangxian of Nanhui Village in our district was a ruler in the village in the past. After the incident, he bought goods for our side as a merchant and served as an economic plainclothes agent for the enemy's gendarmerie. After liberation, he wormed his way into the procurement office of our military region stationed in Xingtai City to purchase goods. When the masses wanted to settle accounts with him, the procurement office repeatedly shielded him and refused to let him return, saying that he was very active and had made contributions in his work, and that taking him back would make it impossible to work. Finally, a political instructor surnamed Shang sent him back, and the masses settled accounts with him for 6.5 million yuan. The masses still did not want him to go out again and wanted to manage him. But every time he was criticized, he went to the Xingtai Procurement Office, and the Procurement Office gave him 6.5 million yuan in compensation tickets, and then let him continue to work. The handling of this matter was not done through local cadres. We strongly disagree with this. Since we are squeezing out feudalism, we should not shield feudalism, say that there is no problem with him, and say that we cannot do without him now. And say that he is active in his work now. We should see why he is active, but he is not convinced in the village (he does not meet with the villagers when he returns home). The masses settle accounts with him, and the public pays to redeem his sins. Who is fighting whom? We suggest that the responsible comrade of the procurement office answer in the newspaper. (Editor's note: The reader did not specify which military region's procurement office it is. We hope the person concerned will check it himself.)

　　到底谁斗争谁？编辑同志：
    我区南会村赵光先，过去是村中一个统治者，事变后，给我方买货当商人，曾投敌宪兵队当经济便衣。解放后，又钻入驻邢台市我军区采办处采买各货，群众要向他清算，三番五次交涉，采办处总是包庇不让回来，说人家很积极，在工作上也立过功，把人要回就不能干。最后由姓尚的指导员送回来了，群众向他清算了六十五万元，群众意见还是不让他再出门，把他管理起来。但是随时斗了随手到邢台采办处，由采办处给赔票子六十五万元，又让人家继续干。处理这问题，又没经过本地区干部。我们对这事情极不同意。咱们既是挤封建，就不该包庇封建，替人家说没问题，说现在离了人家不能干。又说现在工作积极，那应该看看为啥积极，可是在村中并不服气（回家不给村人见面），群众清算他，公家给拿款替人家赎罪，到底这是谁斗争谁？我们意见还是请该采办处负责同志在报纸上答复。（编者按：读者没有指明是那个军区采办处，希当事者自己检查）
