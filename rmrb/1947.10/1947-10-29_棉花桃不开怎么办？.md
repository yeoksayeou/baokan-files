　　What to do When Cotton Bolls Don't Open?
    Xi Fengzhou
    Editor's note: Reader Comrade Wang Yi wrote to inquire about what to do if cotton bolls do not crack open this year. The original letter stated: "The cotton planted by the masses this year did not produce any early bolls before the hot season due to early drought. Then, during the hot season and after the beginning of autumn, there was a lot of rain, especially after autumn, with continuous autumn rains. The bolls that formed have not cracked open until now. Frost has already passed, and the weather is getting colder. I am afraid that the bolls that have already formed will be difficult to fully crack open. Most of the masses in the Jincheng Second District do not have experience in planting cotton. Could you please ask experienced people to introduce some effective methods to make the cotton bolls crack open earlier to benefit the masses and increase cotton income?" Now, we have asked Comrade Xi Fengzhou to answer as follows:
    Comrade Wang Yi's question about cotton bolls not opening is a very common problem in cotton planting in our area this year. Based on experience, there are several ways to make cotton bolls open:
    (1) After the Cold Dew solar term, if most of the cotton bolls are ripe, you can pull the cotton plants up a little from the ground. This restricts the growth of the cotton plants and accelerates the opening of the cotton bolls. The better the weather, the faster they will open. However, the small, immature cotton bolls that grow on the cotton plants will not open quickly.
    (2) After most of the cotton bolls are ripe, you can remove the cotton leaves and unnecessary branch tips to promote early opening of the cotton bolls.
    (3) After about ten days after the Frost solar term, the weather is already cold. If the cotton bolls are still not cracking open at this time, you can pick all the cotton bolls and take them home, spreading them thinly on mats or flat roofs to dry. If the weather is good, the cotton bolls will gradually crack open. To prevent wind and rain damage, it is best to pick them every few days, but only pick them after the cotton bolls have fully opened. If they are too green, it will be difficult to peel them.
    (4) The cotton bolls picked from the field will definitely be of different sizes. It is best to sort them and dry and peel them separately. Because large bolls are ripe bolls and open quickly. Small bolls are unripe bolls and open very slowly, or may not open even when dried.
    (5) If the small cotton bolls that are picked back have been dried for many days and still do not crack open, you can use a stone roller to press them open, or use stones or wooden sticks to break them open. This kind of cotton is very weak and can only be used for lining clothes or quilts. The seed cotton peeled from mature cotton bolls can be spun into thread and woven into cloth if it is of good quality.
    In addition, cotton bolls not opening on time is also related to poor management techniques. To make cotton mature earlier, you can pay attention to the following points when planting cotton in the future:
    (1) In areas with colder climates, do not plant too late. If boll formation is delayed due to drought or flooding, it is best to leave fewer bolls and remove the late flowers.
    (2) If there is too much rain, the foreign cotton will grow more branches. You must prune and thin them frequently to prevent rampant growth. If there are fewer suckers, the cotton bolls on the fruit branches will naturally crack open earlier.
    (3) Use early-maturing cotton varieties. Cotton plants that are too large, have excessively long branches, and have sparse branches are mostly late-maturing cotton and should not be planted. Lint cotton matures very early and has a large yield. There is a lot of this kind of cotton in Gaoyi County in the Taihang Mountains. There is also small black-seeded foreign cotton that matures very early.
    (4) Plant less cotton in shady slopes and cold mountainous areas. Cotton planted in black, fertile soil tends to grow more branches and leaves and matures later. You should plant more cotton in sandy soil, which is easy to penetrate sunlight, has a high soil temperature, and allows cotton bolls to open early.
    (5) Apply sufficient base fertilizer to the cotton fields, using more manure, oilseed cake, and straw manure. However, do not apply too much green manure (human manure and urine). Too much will cause rampant growth of branches and leaves, and the cotton bolls will open late.

### 棉花桃不开怎么办？

　　棉花桃不开怎么办？
    席凤洲
    编者按：读者王毅同志来信，询问今年棉桃不裂口怎么办，原信说：“今年群众种的棉花，因在伏天以前早旱，都没有结下伏圪桃，到伏天和立秋后雨水又很多，特别是秋后，秋雨连绵不绝，棉花结下的圪桃，直到现在还未裂开。现在霜降已过，天气已渐寒，恐怕已结下的花圪桃，也很难全部裂开。晋城二区一带大部群众以前没有种棉经验，是否可请有经验的人介绍一些使花圪桃提早裂开的有效办法来，以利群众增加棉花收入。”现在特请席凤洲同志解答如下：
    王毅同志所提关于棉花不开桃问题，是今年我区植棉中一个很普遍的问题。根据经验证明，要使棉桃开裂，有以下几个办法：
    （一）在寒霜节以后，如果棉桃大部分已成熟，可以把棉棵从地面向上拔起一点。这样，棉棵在生长上受到限制，棉桃就加速开裂，天气越好，开的越快。如棉棵上长的少部分不成熟的小棉桃，就不容易很快开裂了。
    （二）棉桃大部分或熟后，可以把棉叶和不必要的枝条尖头去掉，促进棉桃提前开放。
    （三）过了霜降十几天以后，天气已冷。这时如棉桃还不开裂，就可以把棉桃统统摘回家去，薄薄的摊到席上或平房上去晒，如遇好天棉桃就渐渐开裂，为了防止风雨损失，最好是隔几天就摘一次，但须等棉桃开足再去摘，太生了剥出不好。
    （四）从地里摘回去的棉桃，一定有大有小，最好能够挑选一下，分开晒、分开剥。因为大桃是成熟桃，开的快。小桃是不成熟的桃，开的甚慢，或是就晒不开了。
    （五）摘回的小棉桃，如晒了很多天还不开裂，就可以用石滚压开，或是用石头、木棒捣开。这种棉花很不壮，只能套衣服或被子用。成熟棉桃剥开的籽花，好的还可以纺线织布。
    此外，棉桃不能按时开裂，技术上不会管理也有关系。要使棉花提前成熟，今后再种棉时，可以注意几点：
    （一）当地气候较冷，不可下种太迟，如果因天旱或雨涝结桃迟，最好要留桃少些，并把晚花去掉。
    （二）如遇雨水过多，洋花发枝更要多，要勤修勤打，防止乱发油条。如果油条少了，果枝上的棉桃，就自然早裂开。
    （三）要用早熟棉花品种。凡是棉棵过大、发枝过长、枝节过稀的，多半是晚熟棉花，不要种植。脱籽棉成熟甚早，产量也大，太行区高邑县这种棉花很多，还有小黑籽洋花熟的也很早。
    （四）阴坡地，气候较冷的山地，可以少种棉花。黑色肥土地种棉花，多长枝叶，成熟也晚。要多用砂质土壤种棉，容易透阳光，地温高，棉花开桃早。
    （五）棉田上底粪，多上圈粪、油饼、草粪。但青粪（人粪尿）不要上的太多。多了乱发枝叶，棉桃开的晚。
