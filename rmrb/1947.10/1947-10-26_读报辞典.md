　　Reading the Newspaper Dictionary
　　De Gaulle – Once the commander of the French Resistance, but limited by his extremely selfish class prejudices, he single-mindedly served as a lackey for the 200 French monopoly families. In particular, he was directly funded by the Rothschild syndicate and organized the so-called "De Gaulle Union," brazenly engaging in anti-communist and anti-democratic activities. He colluded with the reactionary factions in the US and Britain, attempting to trap himself with American loans, engaging in various acts of treason. After the war, he served as interim president for a time, but due to the rise of popular forces, he was forced to step down on January 20th of last year. However, with the support of US imperialism, he continues to be active everywhere, plotting a comeback.
　　Radical Party – The political party of the French petty bourgeoisie. Before the war (1936), it formed a People's Front with the French Communist Party and the French Socialist Party, but due to the Munich policies of Daladier and Reynaud and their collusion with the German invaders, the Radical Party's prestige among the people plummeted.
　　Popular Republican Movement – A French bourgeois political party that advocates "Catholic Socialism," led by Bidault. Due to the support of US and British imperialism and their deception of the peasants, they once held the top position in the previous French government. However, because it still maintains close ties with De Gaulle, it has aroused dissatisfaction within the party and among the masses, so the number of votes it has received in each election has been decreasing.
　　Republican Party of Liberty – Formed on January 29, 1946, by various right-wing parties in France, it is an extremely reactionary fascist group. Because it openly advocates attacking the French people, it is opposed by the people and has very few seats in the French parliament.
　　Socialist Party – A right-wing party in France. Although it claims to be a "workers' party," it is actually an appendage of the bourgeoisie and an obstacle to the unity of French workers. After the war, it once formed an alliance with the French Communist Party, but before the vote on the new constitution, its upper echelons betrayed this alliance, further diminishing its prestige. Ramadier of the Socialist Party was only elected president as a result of Communist Party support, but after taking office, he became increasingly reactionary, siding with the reactionary factions in the US and Britain to oppress the domestic people. Its left-wing leaders, such as Seine, and the vast majority of its members are still progressive and advocate for unity with the French Communist Party.
　　Security Council – Officially the United Nations Security Council, is one of the main organs of the United Nations, composed of five permanent members (held by five major powers) and six non-permanent members, directly responsible for maintaining peace and security. Resolutions to take enforcement action adopted at Security Council meetings must be agreed to by all five powers; disagreement by any one country prevents a resolution; that is, each major power has a veto. This is necessary in order to achieve consensus among the major powers and safeguard international peace and security. Therefore, war mongers led by the United States are doing their best to undermine this body: the clamor to "amend the veto" and "establish a temporary committee" are all intended to make the Security Council ineffective.
　　The House Un-American Activities Committee – Officially "Committee on Un-American Activities," chaired by Thomas, is one of the United States' overt intelligence agencies, belonging to the House of Representatives, responsible for investigating and exposing democratic people, compiling "blacklists" of progressive people, carrying out threats, intimidation, and even arrests, and even investigating and revising textbooks in various schools, and investigating and arresting Hollywood actors. This agency has been constantly condemned by the American people, and recently more than 2,000 American writers have demanded its dissolution.
　　The Negro Problem – There are more than 10 million Negroes in the United States, almost one-tenth of the total US population, nearly 10 million of whom live in 397 counties in the eleven states of the southern United States; in this area, Negroes outnumber the total population by more than double. They suffer the brutal oppression and exploitation of the American ruling class (the bourgeoisie among white people), living an inhuman life. Negroes have no share in any political rights. The white bourgeoisie also constantly kills Negroes with the most brutal lynchings. Such atrocities are intended to maintain the especially severe exploitation of Negroes. Negroes have also organized the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People" to fight for freedom. There is also the National Negro Congress, whose leader is the famous musician Robeson. There are many open Communists in this group, and they have a great influence among Negroes. Negro groups are very sympathetic to the Chinese people's liberation movement.

　　读报辞典
    戴高乐——曾做过法国抗战时期的统帅，但由于他极端自私的阶级成见所局限，一心一意当法国二百独占家族的狗腿子，特别是受了罗斯契尔德银团的直接豢养，组织所谓“戴高乐联盟”，放肆地进行反共反民主活动。对外勾结美英反动派，企图拿美国贷款套住自己的脖子，作出种种卖国勾当。战后他曾一度任临时总统，由于人民势力的抬头，被迫于去年一月二十日下台。但在美帝国主义支持下，他仍到处活动，阴谋卷土重来。
    急进党——法国中小资产阶级集团的政党，战前（一九三六年）曾与法共及法国社会党结成人民阵线，但因达拉第和雷诺慕尼黑政策和勾结德寇的错误，急进党在人民中的威信便一蹶不振。
    人民共和党——法国的资产阶级政党，以“天主教社会主义”为号召，以比道尔为首。由于美英帝国主义的撑腰，由于他们对农民的欺骗，曾在上届法政府中占过第一位。但因它仍与戴高乐保持亲密关系，引起党内与群众的不满，所以在历次选举中所得票数一次比一次少。
    共和自由党——一九四六年一月二十九日由法国右翼各党派结成，是顶反动的法西斯集团。由于它公开主张向法国人民进攻，为人民所反对，在法国国会中议席甚少。
    社会党——是法国的右翼政党。它虽以“工人政党”自命，但实际上是资产阶级的附庸，是法国工人团结的阻力，战后又曾与法共联盟，但在新宪法表决前它的上层分子却背叛了这个联盟，而它的威信就因之更为降低。社会党的拉马第之所以能当选总统，仍是受共产党支持的结果，但他上台后却日益反动，投靠美英反动派压迫国内人民。其左派领袖赛南等及广大党员则至今仍是进步的，主张与法共联合的。
    安理会——即联合国政治安全理事会，是联合国的主要机构之一，由五个常任理事（由五个强国担任）及六个非常任理事组成，直接负责维持和平与安全。安理会开会时要通过的采取制裁行动的决议，必须是五强都同意的，任何一国不同意就不能成为决议；这就是说每一个强国都有否决权。这是为了取得强国一致，是保障国际和平安全所必要的。所以以美国为首的战争贩子们就尽力要破坏这个机构：“修改否决权”与“设立临时委员会”等叫嚣，就都是为了要安理会失去作用。
    非美活动委员会——即“违反美国利益行动调查委员会”，主席为汤姆斯，是美国公开的特务机关之一，属于众议院，负责调查及检举民主人士，编制进步人士的“黑名单”，施行威胁恫吓乃至拘捕，甚至竟调查并删改各校的教科书，调查并拘捕好莱坞的演员。这个机关不断遭到美国人民的谴责，最近美国两千余作家并要求解散它。
    黑人问题——在美国黑人有一千多万，几乎占全美人口十分之一，其中近一千万都住在美国南部的十一个邦的三百九十七县；在这区域里黑人超过全人口的一倍。他们受着美国统治阶级（白种人中的资产阶级）的残酷压迫和剥削，过着非人的生活。一切政治权利，黑人是没有份的。白人资产阶级还用最残酷的私刑不断弄死黑人。这样的惨暴行为，目的是为了维持对黑人特别厉害的剥削采取。黑人也组织了“有色人民福利促进会”争取自由。还有黑人全国大会，首领是名音乐家罗伯逊。这一团体中有不少公开的共产党员，他们在黑人中影响极大。黑人团体对中国人民解放运动是非常同情的。
