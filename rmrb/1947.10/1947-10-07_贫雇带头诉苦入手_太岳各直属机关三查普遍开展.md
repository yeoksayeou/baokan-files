　　Starting with Poor and Hired Laborers Complaining About Hardships
  　The "Three Check-Ups" Are Universally Launched in Directly Subordinate Organs of the Taiyue Region
　　[Our newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 30th] All directly subordinate organs in the Taiyue region are universally launching the movement to check class and check ideology, with poor and hired laborers as the backbone, by having them complain about their hardships. The first to conduct the complaints was the political department of the military region. After the mobilization meeting, the poor and hired backbone immediately took the lead in contacting the sufferers to discuss and prepare, and then entered the large-scale complaint meeting. At the military academy's complaint meeting, three people fainted on the spot due to crying in pain. At the political department's complaint meeting, most of the sufferers who were cruelly exploited and oppressed by the old society cried loudly. Soldier Song Jinshui complained that his family had been extremely poor since he was a child, and he worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord. When his parents begged for food at the landlord's door, mother and son dared not recognize each other. Kong Laiwang complained that because he could not afford the rent, he sold his brothers and his father died of illness, and his mother also died. The whole audience cried. At the two-day complaint meeting of the guard company, the whole audience burst into tears, and thirty-nine people fainted. All the crimes were concentrated on the landlords and bullies. The poor and hired comrades stamped their feet and slammed the table, denouncing the deeply hated old society. After the complaints, the awareness of the cadres and soldiers has been unprecedentedly improved. Comrades from landlord backgrounds began to strictly examine their own positions, thoroughly reflect, and stand on the peasants' position. As a result, checking class and checking ideology has formed a broad mass movement. The movement to check class and check ideology started with fear of being deceived, and then naturally entered the stage of complaining about hardships. At the general complaint meeting on the 13th, correspondents Cao Shuben, guard Wei Tingxiu and other sufferers cried and cursed in hoarse voices when they complained about the landlords' oppression and bullying of themselves and their families. As a result, the tragic roars, curses, and cries mixed into a团 in the venue. After three days of complaining, some comrades from landlord backgrounds were moved and began to pour out their dirty water. As the movement developed to this point, everyone unanimously demanded to clean up the objects of struggle lurking inside the organs. Therefore, at the general meeting on the 18th, Yang Jitian, Yang Shuyuan, Li Yulian and other six objects of struggle were proposed and handed over to the masses in their original hometowns for disposal. The Xinhua Branch and the Xinhua Daily also started complaining on the 1st under the leadership of the poor people. Many cadres and staff members from poor backgrounds also wept when they complained about their pain. Currently, a few groups have turned to checking components, tracing poor roots and rich roots. Other organs generally started with complaining about hardships.

　　贫雇带头诉苦入手
  　太岳各直属机关三查普遍开展
    【本报太岳三十日电】太岳各直属机关普遍以贫雇为骨干诉苦，展开查阶级查思想运动。首先进行诉苦的是军区政治部，他们在动员大会之后，贫雇骨干即带头联络苦人进行酝酿，随即进入大会诉苦；军校诉苦大会上当场因痛哭晕倒者三人，政治部的诉苦大会上，受旧社会的残酷剥削压榨的苦人大多号哭失声。战士宋金水诉到他从小家庭一贫如洗，自己给地主作长工，父母讨饭到地主门上，母子见面不敢相认；孔来望诉到因出不起租子，将兄弟卖了父亲病死了，母亲也死了，全场都哭了。警卫连的两天诉苦大会上，全场皆号啕大哭，三十九人哭晕过去，一切罪恶皆集中到地主、恶霸身上，贫雇同志跺脚拍桌子控诉深恶的旧社会。经过诉苦之后，干部、战士的觉悟程度空前提高，出身地主成份的同志便开始了严格检查自己的立场，彻底反省，站到农民立场上来，因而查阶级查思想已形成一个广泛的群众运动。进行的查阶级查思想运动，是先怕上当，便自然的进入了诉苦，十三日全体人员诉苦大会上，通讯员曹树本，警卫员魏廷秀等苦人诉到自己及家庭遭受地主的压榨欺侮时，连骂带哭，声音嘶哑，于是会场上悲壮的吼骂声哭声搅成一团。诉苦进行三天后，感动一部地主出身的同志也开始倒出他们的脏水。运动发展至此，大家便一致要求清洗潜伏在机关内部的斗争对象，于是十八日全体大会中便提出杨极天、杨树垣、李玉连等六个斗争对象，一律交原籍群众处理。新华分社与新华日报社亦在贫民带头下于一日开始了诉苦，不少贫雇出身的干部与事务人员诉到痛处亦泣不成声，现少数小组已转入查成份追穷根与富根。其他各机关普遍从诉苦入手。
