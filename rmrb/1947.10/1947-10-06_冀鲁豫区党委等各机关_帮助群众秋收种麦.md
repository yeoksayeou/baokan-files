(From our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 4th) The Party Committee of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, the Regional Post Office, the cadres and staff of the Party School are actively helping the masses with the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Forty-three cadres and staff members of the Party Committee organs, led by Deputy Director Song and Section Chief Wang, participated, even including the 52-year-old cook Comrade Gao Liangyou and Comrade Xiong Fuliang, who had scabies that had not yet healed. All comrades were in high spirits. Some comrades had blisters on their hands from hoeing, but they did not rest. The fifth group of comrades hoed slowly, so they pulled with their hands until dark. They harvested a total of 47 mu of mung beans in half a day. In addition to manpower assistance, the Regional Post Office used all possible livestock to participate in the autumn harvest and wheat planting of the masses, mainly helping families with less labor and fewer livestock. They also democratically established twenty-one covenants: (1) Autumn harvest or wheat planting must absolutely obey the opinions and commands of the masses. (2) Do not drink a sip of water from the masses, do not smoke a cigarette from the masses. The work has now been going on for four and a half days. The comrades not only consciously abide by the covenants, but also consciously squeeze out time to actively go to the fields and threshing grounds. The Distribution Section took the initiative to push carts to deliver newspapers, and the livestock used to carry newspapers were used to plow and harrow the land for the masses. The several comrades who mastered plowing and harrowing not only completed their tasks on time, but also plowed and harrowed the land very deeply. In order to help the villagers stationed in the village with the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the Party School, led by Section Chief Li of the Academic Affairs Section, led 34 cadres and staff members to harvest 58 mu of millet and corn for the families of revolutionary martyrs and the elderly and disabled without labor within three days, and used livestock carts to pull 27 carts. During the harvest, the cadres and staff were in high spirits.
