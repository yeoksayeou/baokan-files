Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. Reports from various sources: Communist parties in Europe and the Americas have expressed agreement and given high praise to the news of the establishment of the Information Bureau (previously translated as "Liaison Bureau," should be corrected) by the nine European Communist parties. The Polish Communist Party's newspaper "Glos Ludu" stated: "The Warsaw Conference 'marks' the beginning of a new era in the Marxist movement"; and pointed out: "The bosses of Wall Street in New York have decided to rule the world, European countries will defend their national independence, and European workers will defend the fruits of their victory and world peace. The unity of the Communist parties is the first condition for achieving victory in this defense." The General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Slánský, reported on the proceedings of the Warsaw Conference at a meeting of secretaries and representatives of local party branches of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, stating: "The Czechoslovak Communist Party should redouble its efforts to strengthen the ranks of democratic and progressive forces, consolidate democracy, and defend national independence." The General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Pollitt, issued a statement on the 7th, celebrating the decision of the Warsaw Conference to establish the Information Bureau. Pollitt stated: "In Britain, we vow to do our utmost to fight for peace, for national independence and economic prosperity, and to fight against the offensive of the dollar dictators and their supporters in Britain (Churchill and the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party)." The French Communist Party issued a public statement on the 9th, expressing complete agreement with the conclusions of the Warsaw Conference; and stated: "The declaration of the nine Communist parties clarifies the current situation and urgently requires France to guarantee opposition to the conspiracy of American expansionist policies, to maintain national independence and sovereignty, and world peace. The distortions of the Warsaw Conference by the Gaullists and Socialist Party leaders further illustrate that those imperialist policies that attempt to enslave nations have suffered a heavy blow." Longo, one of the leaders of the Italian Communist Party, wrote in "Unità" that "The establishment of the Information Bureau by the nine Communist parties is because they are the most capable of resisting imperialist aggression." The American Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, stated on the 7th that "The actions of the nine European Communist parties are part of Europe's resistance to the diplomatic policies of American imperialism." It is "anti-Wall Street, not anti-American." It also pointed out that those who clamor for the "revival of the Communist International" "only reflect the propaganda of the 'anti-communist axis' of Berlin and Tokyo, which disintegrated after this war. Its purpose is to cover up the US State Department's interference in the independence of other countries, while the measures of the nine Communist parties are to safeguard the interests of their countries."

　　华沙会议获伟大成就
  　欧美共产党齐声赞扬
  　并痛斥美国侵略政策
    【新华社陕北十二日电】各方讯：欧洲九国共产党成立情报局（前曾译为“联络局”，应改正）的消息公布以后，欧美各国的共产党纷表赞同；并予以极高的评价。波共机关报“格罗斯·路登”称：“华沙会议‘标志’着马克斯主义运动新时代的开始”；而且指出：“纽约华尔街的老板们已经决定要统治全世界，欧洲国家将要保卫他们的民族独立，而欧洲工人将要保卫他们胜利的果实与全世界和平。共产党的联合，乃是这种保卫取得胜利的第一个条件”。捷共总书记斯郎斯基于捷共各地方党部书记与代表会议上报告华沙会议经过时称：“捷共当加倍努力，严整民主与进步力量的阵容，巩固民主，保卫国家独立”。英共总书记波立特七日发表谈话，庆祝华沙会议建立情报局的决定。波氏称：“在英国，我们誓竭全力为和平，为国家的独立与经济繁荣而斗争，为反对美元独裁者及其在英国的支持者（邱吉尔与工党右翼领袖）的攻势而斗争”。法共于九日发表公报，对华沙会议的结论表示完全同意；并谓：“九国共产党的宣言，阐明目前形势，急需法国保证反对美国扩张政策的阴谋，维护国家独立与主权以及世界和平。戴高乐党徒及社会党领袖们关于华沙会议的曲解，更着重说明了那些企图使各民族沦为奴隶的帝国主义政策受到了很重的打击。”意共领袖之一隆哥于“团结”报上著文称：“九国共产党的成立情报局，就是因为他们最能抵抗帝国主义之侵略”。美共机关报工人日报七日称：“欧洲九国共产党之行动，为欧洲抵抗美帝国主义外交政策之一部分。”乃系“反华尔街而非反美者。”并指出：叫嚣“共产国际复活”者，“只是反映此次大战后解体之柏林与东京之‘反共轴心’的宣传而已，其目的在掩饰美国务院对他国独立之干涉，而九国共产党之措施，则在保障其国家之利益。”
