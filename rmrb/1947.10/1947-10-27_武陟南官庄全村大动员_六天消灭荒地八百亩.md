    Whole Village Mobilization in Nanguanzhuang, Wuzhi: 800 Mu of Wasteland Eliminated in Six Days
    [Report from Wuzhi by our newspaper] The area of wasteland in the whole county is indeed an alarming figure. In Nanguanzhuang village alone, there are more than 800 mu. Most of these wastelands are fruits of struggle. Some villages have not yet fully distributed them, resulting in wasteland. Some villages, although distributed, the poor peasants and hired laborers lack labor, agricultural tools, seeds, especially animal power, so they have to abandon the land. Farmers in Sanyang Town said: "Even if the land is distributed, we cannot cultivate it, it's just an empty name." Now is the time to seize the opportunity to solve these problems, eliminate wasteland and expand wheat fields. For example, Nanguanzhuang, under the slogan of thoroughly helping the poor peasants and hired laborers to turn over, mobilized the whole village and used labor and animal power in a unified way. In six days, all the wasteland in the village was eliminated and they are now preparing to sow. The village has more than 40 qing of land. Except for the dry land that has been plowed earlier, the land for planting medicinal materials and cotton, there are only about 20 qing of land that need to be plowed now. The village has a total of 49 head of livestock, and each can plow 2 to 3 mu a day, so the whole village can plow more than 1 qing and 20 mu a day. In addition, some can be solved by manual labor. According to the wheat planting time, there are about 20 days from now, and it is not a problem to plant all of them with wheat. Recently, it was decided to implement mutual aid and exchange labor, with livestock specializing in plowing the land and people pulling the drills to sow wheat, which solved the problem of animal power shortage. Recently, the county government has also allocated more than 200 dan of wheat seeds and 2.5 million loans to help solve this problem in a focused manner. (Jiang Bo)

    武陟南官庄全村大动员
    六天消灭荒地八百亩
    【本报武陟讯】荒地的面积在全县说来，确是一个惊人的数字，仅南官庄一村，即有八百余亩。这些荒地大部是斗争果实，有些村直到现在还没全部分配，造成荒芜，有的村庄虽然分配下了，但因贫雇缺乏劳力、农具、种籽、特别是畜力，不得不将土地荒了，三阳镇农民说：分上土地也种不成，白落个空名。现在正应抓紧时间解决这些问题，消灭荒地，扩大麦田，如南官庄在帮助贫雇彻底翻身的口号下，全村大动员，统一使用劳畜力，六天的时间，全村荒地消灭完了，现正准备下种。该村共有四十余顷土地，除旱地早犁过，种药材地、种棉花地外，现在需要犁的地只有二十余顷。全村共有牲口四十九犋，每犋一天能犁二亩至三亩，全村一天即可犁到一顷二十余亩，另外还可用人工解决一部。按种麦时间计算，从现在算起约有二十余天，全部种上麦不成问题。最近又决定实行互助变工，牲口专犁地，人拉耧种麦，解决了畜力困难。最近县政府并已拨出二百余石麦种和二百五十余万贷款，有重点的帮助解决这一问题。（江波）
