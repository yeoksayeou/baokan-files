　　Chiang Kai-shek the Traitor
  　Again Consecrates Yantai to America
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th -- After the Chiang bandit troops invaded and occupied Yantai, they immediately offered the area to American imperialism as a military base. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 2nd, "Washington has accepted the invitation of the Chinese government (the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang), and the Pacific Fleet currently stationed in Qingdao will utilize the port (referring to Yantai)." This matter once again exposes Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous face, fighting for the interests of American imperialism, and American imperialism's ambition to destroy China. The Associated Press further revealed that American imperialism had long coveted Yantai, stating that "American naval strategists had been discussing the Yantai issue for a long time before the day (the Chiang bandits) occupied Yantai." Note: Not long after Japan surrendered, on October 4, 1945, the American imperialist naval authorities issued an ultimatum to the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Yantai, unreasonably demanding that the Chinese People's Liberation Army immediately withdraw from Yantai so that the American navy could be stationed there. The Chinese People's Liberation Army righteously refused this imperialist act of aggression against our sacred territorial sovereignty. Their conspiracy thus failed to materialize.
    According to a Central News Agency report, the UNRRA personnel who recently withdrew from Yantai have now returned to Yantai with the Chiang bandits to work, and have officially announced that they will resume "relief" to Yantai. This matter once again declares the complete bankruptcy of UNRRA's so-called lie of ceasing relief to areas north of 34 degrees north latitude. UNRRA has nakedly become involved in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's anti-people civil war.

### 蒋介石卖国贼　又把烟台奉献美国

　　蒋介石卖国贼
  　又把烟台奉献美国
    【新华社陕北七日电】蒋匪侵陷烟台后，立即将该地奉送给美帝国主义作为军事基地。据美联社上海二日电报导：“华盛顿已接受中国政府（蒋家匪帮）之邀请，现驻青岛之太平洋舰队将利用该港（指烟台）。”此事又暴露了蒋介石为美帝国主义利益而战的卖国贼面目，与美帝国主义企图灭亡中国之野心。美联社继又透露美帝国主义对烟台垂延已久，据称：“一日（蒋匪）占领烟台前，美海军战略家们早已谈论烟台问题很久了。”按：日本投降后不久，一九四五年十月四日美帝国主义海军方面即曾以最后通告，送烟台中国人民解放军指挥部，无理要求中国人民解放军立即撤离烟台，由美国海军进驻，中国人民解放军当对此种侵犯我国神圣领土主权之帝国主义侵略行为严正拒绝。其阴谋遂未能实现。
    又据中央社报导，日前由烟台撤退之联总人员，现已随蒋匪重回烟台工作，并正式宣布将恢复对烟台之“救济”。此事又一次宣布联总所谓停止救济北纬三十四度以北地区之谎言完全破产。联总业已赤裸裸地卷入蒋介石匪帮的反人民内战。
