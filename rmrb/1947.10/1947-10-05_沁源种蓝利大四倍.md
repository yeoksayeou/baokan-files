　　[Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 2nd] Qinyuan has had a bumper harvest of indigo, yielding four times the profit. The Qinyuan County government, in order to solve the difficulties of the disaster-stricken people of Qinyuan, especially called for large-scale indigo planting this spring. Now, the county's 2,248 mu of indigo have been harvested, with an estimated yield of 100 jin per mu, totaling 224,880 jin of indigo dye. At 700 yuan per jin, this can be sold for more than 150 million yuan, which can buy more than 15,700 shi of millet. If planting millet were to yield 1.5 dou of millet per mu, only 3,372 shi of millet could be harvested. Compared with indigo planting, there is a difference of more than 11,360 shi. This is worth promoting in restoring the rural economy after the devastation by Yan and Chiang. For example, the urban area planted 460 mu, with an income equivalent to 315 shi of millet. The entire urban area has 647 households, with each household increasing by 6.8 dou of millet. If each household has an average of six people, each household can solve the annual food supply for two people, but on average, each family only uses a little more than 0.7 mu of land, which is very profitable.

　　沁源种蓝利大四倍
    【本报太岳二日电】沁源种蓝丰收，利大四倍。沁源县政府，为给灾难重重的沁源人民解决困难，今春特号召大量种蓝。现该县二千二百四十八亩蓝已丰收，计每亩产量一百斤，共可打靛二十二万四千八百八十斤，每斤以七百元计，可卖洋一万万五千余万元，可买小米一万五千七百余石，如种谷子每亩以石五斗的小米产量计，只可收小米三千三百七十二石，与种蓝比赛，则相差一万一千三百六十多石。在恢复自阎蒋劫后的农村经济上，这是值得推广的。如城关种四百六十亩，收入合小米三百一十五石，全城关六百四十七户，每户增加小米六石八斗，若平均每户以六口人计，每户可解决二口人的一年食粮，但是平均一家才用去七分多地，其利甚大。
