In addition, in-depth mobilization of the masses was carried out so that the masses voluntarily and consciously organized. Woman Li Neng'e proposed that women guarantee to cut grain and men carry manure, and proposed competitions by squads; 2. Do what you can do. Women and children cut grain, a few old ladies and children looked after the babies and cooked, young and strong men carried manure, and old men plowed or led women to cut grain. After the grain was cut, the corn was immediately stripped, and the men cleaned up the wheat fields. At the same time, autumn harvest and autumn planting were carried out simultaneously; 3. Equivalent exchange rewards. According to the amount of work, special work was given more points.
