　　New Book Published
    "Textbook on the Constitution of the Communist Party of China" Compiled by Wen Yi and Shi Lan
    Since the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, a new Party Constitution has been adopted, and the previous Party member textbooks compiled and printed by various regions based on the old Party Constitution are of course no longer suitable.

    This book is based on the Party Constitution passed by the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution," and it is compiled with reference to several Party Constitution textbooks of the troops. It can be used as a basic textbook for cadres and soldiers below the company level to study the Party Constitution, and it is equally applicable to lower and middle-level cadres of the Party, government, and people.

    The book is divided into six units: Chinese Revolution, the Communist Party of China, Party Members, Rights and Obligations of Party Members, Party's Organizational Structure and Democratic Centralism, and the Party's Past and Present, totaling twenty-seven lessons. There are three attachments at the end of the book: (1) List of Members and Alternate Members of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, (2) List of Names of Revolutionary Leaders Who Died, and (3) Memorial Ode to the Revolutionary Martyrs of China by the Delegates of the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Representatives of the People of Yan'an.

    Each lesson is followed by "Notes for Lecturing" and "Study Outlines," which are convenient for teaching and learning.

    这本书就是根据中共七代大会通过的党章和刘少奇同志“关于修改党章的报告”，并参考部队的几个党章教材编写起来的，可供连级以下干部及战士学习党章的基本教材，对党政民中下级干部亦同样适用。
    全书分中国革命、中国共产党、党员、党员的权利与义务、党的组织机构与民主集中制、党的过去与现在共六个单元，二十七课。书后并有附件三个：（一）中共第七届中央委员与后补中央委员名单（二）死难革命领袖题名（三）中共七大代表暨延安人民代表追悼中国革命死难烈士祭文。
    每课课文后面，还有“讲课注意”与“研究提要”，教、学都很方便。
