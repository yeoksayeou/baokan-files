　　Tito and New Yugoslavia
　　Liu Ningyi
　　The train, like a wild horse, roared and sped along the left bank of a great river, through groves of trees, through dozens of tunnels, and across dozens of bridges, still not leaving the towering mountains and undulating hills. An old worker, my friend, raised his glass and happily told me:
　　"Comrade Liu, we've reached the border of Bosnia, the birthplace of Yugoslavia and Tito's guerrillas. Let's drink to our first liberated city!"
　　"Let's drink to Yugoslavia's 'Yan'an'!"
　　"Let's drink to General Tito for shooting down American planes!"
　　"Let's drink to Comrade Mao Zedong for expelling American imperialism and defeating Chiang Kai-shek!"
　　Everyone on the train sang the guerrilla march together. The train moved forward in the heavy night. The old worker began to talk slowly about the situation of the resistance in the South at that time:
　　"The people of the South never succumbed to fascism. In this very place, they fought countless battles. We lived in the mountains and forests. Since June 6, 1941, when our people, under the leadership of General Tito, began armed struggle against fascism, our patriotic front has united all the patriotic sons and daughters of the South to fight against German and Italian fascism. At that time, there was a Mihailović—you know, Comrade Mao Zedong mentioned him in 'On Coalition Government', didn't he? Like Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek, he also had a party, not called the Kuomintang, but the Chetniks. They were indeed people of Yugoslavia, but what they did and said was German. Just like Chiang Kai-shek, I heard that his tongue and teeth were made for him by Americans. They maintained order for the Germans, collectively massacred their compatriots, and then ate and danced with the Germans. On average, one out of every eleven people in Yugoslavia was killed by the enemy puppets, especially in Bosnia, where 400,000 out of two million people were killed, arranging human heads on the snow. But Britain and the United States supplied Mihailović with a lot of guns and bullets. We seized the enemy's weapons with our bare hands and equipped ourselves. The Germans and Italians organized seven major offensives against Tito's guerrillas, but they were all crushed. The enemy often stationed thirty-five elite Nazi divisions in the South, but they dared not move a step except to hide in bunkers."
　　Mihailović initially flew the banner of anti-German resistance. Tito negotiated with him twice, but he refused to cooperate against Germany. Why? He intended to deceive the people. In reality, he was colluding with Germany. He had nothing in common with the people. In the end, he himself admitted it in court. Chiang Kai-shek admitted that he was for America before going to court, not as good as Mihailović's pretense. Mihailović was beheaded after a public trial by the people. He paved the way for Chiang Kai-shek!
　　"Tito, led the people to resist Germany. During the war, he organized the people's armed forces, established the 'Ren Rijai Arsenal' and hospitals, and organized the people to engage in industrial and agricultural production while fighting. Look at the bunkers along the road, countless bullet marks, all shot by us. They shrank inside, and we cultivated the land outside. To be honest, many of the railway bridges were destroyed by ourselves. The more battles we fought, the more guns we had. Our guerrilla teams had political work teams and cultural work teams, newspapers, and radios. When there were no battles, there were evening parties, concerts, music and dances, very pleasant. From June 1941 to October 24, 1944, after more than three years of struggle, the people grew stronger. –Of course, your China is even more incredible, thirty-six years, oh, thirty-six years…"
　　"Tito not only led the people to defeat fascism, but he also led the people to liquidate the pro-German faction. The peasants were given land, and the workers managed the factories. The sons and daughters of the South can defeat the fascist bandits and build a strong and happy Yugoslavia."
　　The old friend continued to tell many stories about Tito during the war. By then, the train had entered the capital of Bosnia’s train station. A dark crowd gathered at the station, chanting in unison: "Long live liberated China, long live Mao Zedong, long live General Tito!"
　　"I am honored to represent all the workers in our city to present flowers and pay respects to the heroic fighting workers of China. We are competing to complete General Tito's Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. We wish you Chinese—Mao Zedong's workers—success in your struggle for independence, democracy and liberation soon!"
　　The union leader welcomed us with this short and powerful speech.
　　We boarded the union's car and entered this mountain city of Sarajevo, crossing the bridge where the Austrian crown prince was assassinated in 1914. The workers told us about the Roman Empire, Turkey, Austria, Germany, Italy, which had been pressing down on the people of the South for thousands of years. Turning the pages of the history of the South, every page was written with blood and tears. Only today has the team led by General Tito liberated them, and the people have turned over from suffering. They are the masters of the country.
　　Female workers, female students, and village girls held black veils in their hands and danced. This symbolizes light. According to the Islamic custom here, women have worn black veils for many years. Now they are liberated, they have taken them off and seen the light. For many years, the rulers have provoked Muslims, Catholics, Serbians, and Croats to oppose each other and kill each other. Tito has established freedom of religion and ethnic equality. In Congress, in the Nationalities Chamber, in factories, in barracks, and in rural areas, everyone is harmonious and united, competing for the Five-Year Plan.
　　"In the anti-German struggle, different religions and different ethnic groups shed blood together. We have no reason not to unite!"
　　The name Tito is inseparable from the flesh and blood of the Yugoslav people, and inseparable from Yugoslavia. I hear this name every day, every hour, even every minute. The trade union of the South understood our eagerness to see this comrade, so they sent us by plane from Bosnia to Belgrade. It happened to be General Tito's rest day, so we were worried that we would not be able to meet him, but the Vice President told us: "General Tito wants to see you and invites you to Moravia for a trip." The trade union sent us by plane again to a forest city in the southwest.
　　This is the shore of Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj; the upper reaches of the Sava River, the water flows out of the forest, bypasses the foothills, and flows tortuously, but the lake water is slightly rippling in the arms of the green mountains. The shadow of the mountains fell on the lake, making it particularly green and lovely. The fish swam back and forth in the lake, seemingly deliberately showing off to the Chinese people suffering from civil war.
　　Comrade Milica smiled and said to me: "Do you like this place?"
　　"I'm afraid it's too expensive! China is still in civil war."
　　Voja Lovrić and Milica laughed. They said it was a worker's sanatorium, free of charge, and every worker could come here for two weeks of rest each year. They wanted me to live here with them. They particularly emphasized:
　　"Our workers and Comrade Tito both spend their summer here."
　　On July 7, I met this giant—Tito—in the suburbs of Ljubljana. He shook hands with us warmly. He has a steel-like and straightforward personality, very simple and cheerful, but he studies every problem very carefully. We talked about the World Federation of Trade Unions, and he was particularly interested. He said that the world's workers are united to oppose American fascism. Under the united front of the world's workers, a third world war is impossible. No country, whether it is the United States or other imperialists, can unify internally to serve reactionary fascism. The people of the whole world have progressed and are organized. No matter how the reactionaries shout, as long as the people of the whole world unanimously oppose war, a third world war cannot happen. Therefore, we have the responsibility and the power to prevent it.
　　As for Yugoslavia, it resolutely opposes American imperialism. The people of the South relied on their own efforts during the long-term resistance. The South did not receive American help. If one must say there was any, it was only two small and broken ships, which were far inferior to the destruction of American aircraft in the South, but the United States withheld and refused to return the 40 million US dollars that the South had in the United States; it wanted to default on its debt, which was impossible. The people of various democratic countries now have various kinds of contact, and will continue to have close contact in the future. He admired the Chinese people's heroic struggle against American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek.
　　"The struggle led by the people of the liberated areas of China has great significance for world peace." Everyone raised their glasses to toast "the unity of the world's people and the struggle of the Chinese people." The conversation ended satisfactorily and happily. He sincerely suggested:
　　"Comrades, you have worked too hard and have no chance to rest every day. I suggest you go to the Adriatic coast for a few days!"
　　"The comrades said they were afraid we would spend too much money," Voja said.
　　"Now the people of the South are willing to entertain our brothers from afar."
　　The car set off again towards the Trieste National Defense Avenue, which had already begun construction according to Tito's plan, heading straight into the heavily defended area with shady trees and rugged stone walls. Along the way, we saw the stalwart soldiers of the South, driving tanks, carrying machine guns, and dragging artillery, patrolling this democratic paradise, all the way to the surging Mediterranean Sea.

### 铁托和新南斯拉夫

　　铁托和新南斯拉夫
    刘宁一
    火车象野马一样，顺着一条大河左岸，在树丛中，奔驰怒啸，穿过几十个山洞，跨过几十座大桥，还没走出这崇山峻岭和起伏的岗峦。一位年老的工人，我的朋友，举起酒杯，高兴的告诉我：
    “刘同志，波斯米亚的边境到了，南斯拉夫和铁托游击队的发源地就是这里，为我们第一个解放的城市喝一杯！”
    “为南斯拉夫的‘延安’喝一杯！”
    “为铁托将军打美国飞机喝一杯！”
    “为毛泽东同志驱逐美帝国主义和击败蒋介石喝一杯！”
    全车的人，一齐唱起了游击队进行曲，火车在沉沉的夜幕中前进着，老工人漫漫谈起了当时南国的抗战情形：
    “南国的人民，始终不屈于法西斯主义，就在这一个地方，打了不知道多少次仗，我们一直生活在山林中。自从一九四一年六月六日，我们人民在铁托将军领导之下，开始了对法西斯作武装斗争，我们的爱国阵线，团结了一切南国的爱国儿女，和德意法西斯斗争。那时有一个米海洛维区——你是知道的，毛泽东同志在论联合政府上讲过，不是吗？汪精卫、蒋介石之流，他也有一个党，名字不叫国民党，而叫做塞特尼克。他们的确是南斯拉夫的人，但是所做的事所讲的话，却是德国的。就如同蒋介石，听说他的舌头和牙齿都是美国人给他按的一样。他们替德国人维持治安，集体屠杀了他们的同胞后，就和德国人一块吃酒跳舞去高兴。南斯拉夫平均每十一个人里就有一个被敌伪所杀死，特别是波斯米亚二百万人中就有四十万被杀死，把人头在雪地上排起来。但是英美却供给米海洛维区不少的枪支和子弹。我们从赤手空拳夺取了敌伪的武装，装备了自己。德意会组织了对铁托游击队七次大进攻，但都被粉碎了。敌人经常在南国驻扎三十五个精锐的纳粹师团，但他们除了在碉堡里藏着而外，一步也不敢乱动的。”
    米海洛维区开始打的是反德旗帜，铁托两次和他谈判，他终不肯合作抗德，为什么呢？他居心骗人民，实际上是和德国勾结着，他和人民毫无共同之点，最后在法庭上他自己也承认了。蒋介石还没有上法庭就承认是为了美国，还没有米海洛维区装的好。米海洛维区是在人民公审之下上了断头台，他给蒋介石开辟了道路！
    “铁托，领导人民抗击了德国，他在抗战中，组织了人民的武装，设立了‘任日哉兵工厂’和医院，组织了人民，一面斗争，一面从事于工业农业的生产。你看，沿路的碉堡，无数的弹痕，这都是被我们打的，他们缩到里边，我们就在外面种地。老实说，铁路桥梁很多是我们自己把它毁掉的。我们作战的次数越多，枪越多。我们的游击队里有政工队，有文工队，报纸，无线电，不打仗了就有晚会，有音乐会，有音乐跳舞，非常愉快。自从一九四一年六月到一九四四年十月二十四日，三年多的斗争，人民壮大起来了。——你们中国当然更不消讲，三十六年了，噢，三十六年了……。”
    “铁托，不但领导人民战胜了法西斯，他还领导了人民清算了亲德派，农民分到了土地，工人管理了工厂。南国的儿女能战败法西斯强盗，更能建立富强的幸福的南斯拉夫。”
    老朋友又连续讲了很多铁托在抗战时的故事。那时火车已经进了波斯米亚首都的火车站。车站上一片黑压压的人群，齐声呼唤：“解放的中国万岁，毛泽东万岁，铁托将军万岁！”
    “我很荣幸，代表我们全城工人，向中国英勇斗争的工人献花致敬。我们为着铁托将军的五年计划的提前完成，作着竞赛运动，祝你们中国——毛泽东的工人，独立民主解放的斗争早日成功！”
    工会领袖在这简短有力的致词中欢迎着我们。
    我们乘上了工会的汽车，走进这座山城沙来驿，穿过一九四一年与国太子被刺于塞尔维亚的那座桥。工人们对我们讲述罗马帝国、土耳其、奥国、德国、意大利，千百年来压在南国人民的头上，翻开南国历史，一页一页的莫不是用血泪写成的，只有今天，铁托将军领导的队伍把他解放了，人民从苦难中翻过身来。他们是该国的。
    女工，女学生，和村姑们，把黑色的面巾握在手里跳着舞，这是象征着光明。这里回教的习惯，多少年来女人都戴黑面巾，现在她们解放了，拿开了它，见到了光明。多少年来统治者挑拨回教徒、天主教徒、塞尔维亚人、喀萨人，相互对立，相互残杀。铁托制定了信教自由，民族平等，在国会里，在民族院里，在工厂里，在兵营里，在农村里，在每个角落里，都是和睦的，团结的，为了五年计划作着比赛。
    “在反德斗争中，不同的宗教，不同的民族，血是流在一起的，我们没有理由不团结！”
    铁托这个名字，和南斯拉夫人民的血肉是分不开了，和南斯拉夫是分不开了。我每天每时每刻，甚至每分钟都听到人们讲这个名字。南国的工会很了解我们急于看看这位同志，他们用飞机从波斯米亚把我们送到贝尔格来德，可巧轮到铁托将军休息，担心着见不成了，但是副总统告诉我们：“铁托将军愿意看你们，并邀请你们到摩拉维亚去，玩一趟。”工会又把我们用飞机送到了西南方向森林的城里。
    这里是泊莱德湖和抱恨湖的沿岸；沙瓦河的上游，水从树林里流出来，绕过山麓，曲折地奔流着，湖水却在青山的怀抱里微微荡漾。山的影子倒在湖面上，格外显得碧绿可爱，鱼在湖里游来游去，好象故意对我们内战灾难中的中国人民表示骄傲。
    米丽经同志笑了，她向我说：“你喜欢这个地方吗？”
    “恐怕太贵了吧！中国还在内战。”
    窝亚·洛伏理区和米丽经，大笑起来。他们说这是工人的休养所，不要钱，每个工人一年中可以来休息两个礼拜，他们要我同他们一同住在这里。他们特别强调的说：
    “我们工人和铁托同志都是在这里避暑的。”
    七月七日，在犹比野那的效外，会见了这位巨人——铁托。他热烈的和我们握手，他有一个钢毅直率的性格，很朴素，爽快，但是他对于各种问题都是很细心地研究。我们谈到了世界工联会，他特别有兴趣，他说世界工人联合起来了，一致反对美国法西斯主义，在世界工人团结一致的阵线下，世界是不可能发生第三次大战了，无论美国或其他帝国主义者，没有一个国家国内能统一起来为反动的法西斯服务，全世界的人民进步了，有组织了，反动者无论怎样喊，只要全世界的人民一致不战争，第三次大战就不能发生，因此我们有责任也有力量能够阻止它。
    至于谈到南斯拉夫，更是坚决反对美帝国主义者。南国在长期抗战中，南国人民自力更生，南国并未得到美国的帮助，一定要说有，那只有两只又破又小的船，较之美机在南国的破坏，相差不知几何，而美国却将南国存在美国的四千万美金扣而不还；他要赖债，那是办不到的，各民主国家的人民，现在已经有了各种各样的联络，今后更会经常的密切的联系起来。他对于中国人民的反对美帝国主义和蒋介石的英勇斗争，不胜敬佩。
    “中国解放区人民所领导的这一斗争，对世界的和平，有重大的意义。”大家举起杯来，祝“世界人民的团结，中国人民的奋斗”。满意的愉快的结束了谈话，他诚恳的建议：
    “同志们，太辛苦了，每天没有休息的机会，我提议你们到亚得里亚海边去玩几天吧！”
    “同志们说，怕我们花钱太多了。”窝亚说。
    “现在南国的人民，是愿意招待我们远来的兄弟的。”
    汽车又向着那依照铁托计划业已开始建造的底里雅斯特国防大路出发了，直奔入林木丛荫、石壁嶙峋的国防重地。沿路见到南国的健儿们，驾着坦克，背着机枪，拖着大炮，横巡着这民主乐土，一直到波涛澎湃的地中海。（八月十二日）
