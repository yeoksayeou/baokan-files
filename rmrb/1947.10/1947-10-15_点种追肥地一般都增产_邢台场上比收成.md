　　Spot Planting and Topdressing Generally Increase Production
　　Xingtai Field Compares Harvests
　　[Report from this newspaper, Xingtai] The old district of Xingtai continues to implement the movement of comparing crops and comparing technologies. As the autumn harvest nears completion, the masses are now being organized to compare harvests during threshing. According to calculations from three households in Shuimen Village, District Nine, crops that received topdressing and were spot-planted with carried water yielded two to five dou (large dou) more than in past bumper years. Zhang Guifa had four fen of paddy field that previously yielded a maximum of six dou, but this year harvested one shi and five sheng of millet. Sun Dezhi's one mu of waterlogged land yielded eight dou, five dou more than in the past. Feng Jiuxi carried water to plant one mu and two fen of dry land, reaping forty-eight bundles of millet, estimated to yield at least one shi and five dou, an increase of seven dou. Throughout the old district, a total of 40,421 mu of crops (excluding specialty products) were spot-planted with carried water, and over 35,000 mu of paddy fields were topdressed. Based on the lowest estimate, each mu yields one dou more than in an average year, resulting in a total increase of 7,541 large shi of grain. To further clarify the effects of deep plowing, careful cultivation, spot planting, and topdressing to the masses, they are also organized to re-compare crops that were not topdressed or spot-planted with carried water. During the comparison and inspection, the millet that was not spot-planted with carried water was only knee-high, the ears were still green, some had not yet developed, and a harvest of two dou per mu was uncertain. The same land without topdressing also yielded one to three dou less per mu. This clarified the reasons for the increased production and debunked sayings such as "competing for mu when planting wheat, not competing for manure." The comparison of harvests has directly promoted the current production movement. During the rush harvest and planting, villages are paying attention to deep plowing, careful cultivation, and improving technology. Cao Jianjun, a hero from Xiaoge Village in District Eight, proposed the slogan: "Early wheat planting has three advantages: it saves seeds, resists freezing, and grows well; not too early, matures well, and the grain is full." The Li Shui of the Seventh District convened a meeting of old men to study technology, proposing: "When planting wheat, the land should be plowed deeply, the soil should be mixed evenly, emphasize depth over shallowness when planting, and prioritize base fertilizer over topdressing." Wheat planting generally involves plowing twice or harrowing once and plowing once, with over fifty dan of fertilizer applied per mu. Zhou Tiande, a hero from Beiyehe in District Ten, applied as much as ninety dan of fertilizer per mu. District Eleven has expanded its wheat fields by more than two qing. Under the leadership of hero Wang Junsheng in Shuimen, the masses, in order to further enrich themselves, purchased four mules, seven donkeys, and one horse in less than a month before autumn, accelerating harvesting and plowing.

　　点种追肥地一般都增产
  　邢台场上比收成
    【本报邢台讯】邢台老区继续贯澈比庄稼比技术运动，秋收将完，近又组织群众在打场时比收成。现据九区水门村三个户的计算，上追肥和担水点种的庄稼，比过去丰收年还要多收二斗到五斗（大斗）。张贵法有四分水地，过去最多打过六斗，今年打谷子一石零五升。孙得智一亩赖水地，打了八斗，比过去多打五斗。冯九西担水种的一亩二分旱地，割谷子四十八个，估计最少可打石五，多收七斗。全老区共担水点种庄稼四万零四百二十一亩（特产除外），水地上追肥三万五千多亩，按最低的计算，每亩比平年也多收一斗，共可增粮七千五百四十一大石。为使群众对深耕细作、点种追肥的效果，认识更明确，又组织群众和不上追肥、不担水种的庄稼重新对比，检查对比中，没担水种的谷子，才长到膝盖高，穗还发青，有的还没打苞，每亩收二斗也不保险。不上追肥的同等地，每亩也少收一斗到三斗，才明确了增产的原因，打破了“种麦争垧不争粪”等说法。经过比收成，直接推动了当前的生产运动，各村在抢收抢种中，都注意了深耕细作提高技术问题。八区小戈了英雄曹尖俊提出：“麦种早，有三好，省种顶冻长的好，不坐早熟籽又饱”的口号。七区理水招集老头座谈会研究技术，提出“种麦子地要刨深，土要打匀，种时认深不认浅，认上底粪不认拦（追肥）。”种麦时都普遍做到犁两遍，或刨一遍犁一遍，每亩上肥都在五十担以上。十区北野河英雄周天德每亩上肥达到九十担。十一区已扩大麦田两顷多，水门在英雄王俊生领导下，群众为进一步发家，在秋前不到一个月就买了骡四头，驴七头，马一匹，加紧收耕。（安祥）
