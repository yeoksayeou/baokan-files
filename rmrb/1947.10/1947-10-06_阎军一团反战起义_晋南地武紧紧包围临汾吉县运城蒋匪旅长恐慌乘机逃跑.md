　　Yan Army Regiment Uprising Against the War
  　Jinnan Local Armed Forces Closely Surround Linfen, Jixian, and Yuncheng; Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Brigade Commander Panicked and Took the Opportunity to Flee
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The 107th Regiment of the Chiang-Yan Army's 66th Division staged an anti-civil war uprising in Gucun, Qixian County, on September 22nd, and has now safely arrived in the liberated area. After our army's great counter-offensive, Yan Xishan urgently ordered the regiment to support the isolated island of Linfen in the south. The regiment's deputy commander (originally the regiment commander, demoted due to dissatisfaction with Yan Xishan), Cao Yumin, and Chief of Staff Zhao Weiguo waited for the opportune moment and led more than 400 officers and soldiers, killing the most reactionary battalion commander and two company instructors. They took with them two mortars, 31 light and heavy machine guns, 20 small cannons, and over 100 rifles. On the way, they also took care of the Yan bandit's village public office in Taoyuanpu, Pingyao County, seizing some weapons.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 4th] The local armed forces of the Jinnan People's Liberation Army are tightening the two major encirclements of Linfen and Jixian cities, destroying all strongholds within 20 li around the city walls, and the enemy troops defending the city are completely isolated. On the eastern front, the Taiyue troops completely annihilated the enemy's Fenxi and Jixian "Security Police Teams" on September 9th in the Linfen encirclement. The Jinxi troops cooperated in combat from west to east, annihilating the enemy's Chengguan Village Public Office 15 li south of Puxian County on the 18th. On the 19th, they defeated more than 300 enemy Hongtong refugee security police teams 20 li northwest of Linfen. On the western front, Hu’s army in Jixian County withdrew to the west of the river in late September to reinforce northern Shaanxi. Only refugee armed forces from Daning, Xiangning, Hejin, and Jishan counties remain in the city. The local people's armed forces have been raiding the enemy's township public offices in the suburbs of the city for days, beheading and displaying those captured as a warning. Preliminary statistics show that the Jin Sui troops alone killed, wounded, and captured more than 160 enemy soldiers, seized 6 light machine guns, 97 rifles, and other military supplies.
    [This Newspaper, Taiyue, 4th] The Chiang bandits trapped in Yuncheng and Anyi are in a state of panic under our annihilating blows. The pseudo "Hedong Daily" wailed incessantly, shouting: "Danger! Danger!" The city gates are completely closed and martial law has been declared. Residents have no freedom of movement, and the entire city is like a place where someone has died. Artillery fire on the city walls is continuous throughout the day, firing aimlessly at the suburbs. The pseudo 14th Special District Office dispatched military police to search for and arrest over 2,000 strong laborers, merchants, and students, forming them into "self-defense teams" to serve as cannon fodder. Rumors circulated in the city that when Shen Xiangkui, the brigade commander of the 83rd Brigade, was about to escape by plane, Xie Kejian, the commissioner of the pseudo 14th Special District Office, and An Yimin, the commissioner of the 7th Special District Office, shamelessly knelt and begged him to "stay." However, Shen was only concerned with himself and rushed to the Yuncheng suburban airport overnight on September 12th, taking the opportunity to escape. At that time, Xie Kejian and others ordered merchants to block the road and "keep" him. The Chiang bandits became enraged, injuring several people with bayonets and fleeing in a panic.

　　阎军一团反战起义
  　晋南地武紧紧包围临汾吉县运城蒋匪旅长恐慌乘机逃跑
    【本报特讯】蒋阎军六十六师一○七团，九月二十二日于祁县谷村举行反内战起义，现已安抵解放区。我军大反攻后，阎匪急令该团南援临汾孤岛，该团副团长（原系团长，因不满阎匪被降为副团长）曹玉民、参谋长赵维国待以时机成熟，遂率领官兵四百余人，将最反动的一个营长与两个连指导员打死，携带迫击炮两门，轻重机枪三十一挺，小炮二十门，步枪百余支起义。路上并将平遥县桃园堡阎匪治村公所解决，缴武器一部。
    【新华社晋绥四日电】晋南解放军地方武装紧缩对临汾及吉县城的两大包围圈，摧毁城垣四周二十里外的一切据点，城内守敌完全陷入孤立。东线太岳部队上月九日在临汾包围一举歼灭敌汾西、吉县两流亡“保警队”，晋西部队则自西向东配合作战，十八日在蒲县城南十五里处歼灭敌城关村公所；十九日复在临汾西北二十里处击溃敌洪洞流亡保警队三百余人。西线吉县胡军于上月下旬撤往河西增援陕北，城内仅余大宁、乡宁、河津、稷山等县的流亡武装，当地人民武装连日奔袭城郊敌乡公所、斩获示众。初步统计，仅晋绥部队即毙伤俘敌一百六十余人，缴轻机枪六挺，步枪九十七支及其他军用品一部。
    【本报太岳四日电】被困于运城、安邑之蒋匪，在我歼灭性的打击下，恐慌万状，伪“河东日报”悲鸣不已，大叫：“危险！危险！”城门完全封闭，并宣布戒严，居民毫无行动自由，全城就象死了人一样。城上炮火竟日，毫无目标的向城郊放射。伪十四专署派宪警大肆搜捕壮丁及商民、学生二千余人，编成“自卫队”充当炮灰，城内传说八十三旅旅长沈向奎将要乘飞机逃跑时，伪十四专署专员谢克俭、七专署专员安一民，曾无耻下跪哀求苦苦“挽留”，但沈逆已自顾不暇，在上月十二日连夜赶向运城城郊机场，乘机逃跑。当时谢克俭等下令迫使商人阻道“挽留”，此时蒋匪老羞成怒，用刺刀杀伤数名，丧魂失魄而去。
