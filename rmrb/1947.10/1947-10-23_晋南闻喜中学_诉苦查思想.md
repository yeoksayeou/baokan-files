　　Jinan Wenxi Middle School
  　Speaking Bitterness and Investigating Thoughts
    [This newspaper's Taiyue 21st dispatch] Jinan Middle School and Wenxi Middle School investigated class and investigated thoughts. Poor students who had been exploited and oppressed by feudal forces recalled their past lives and bitterly spoke of their suffering. When student Zhao Junxiu recounted how his whole family was exploited by the landlord, their land was seized, his father died of illness, his mother died of hunger, his sister was sold, and his brother ran away, leaving him to herd cattle for the landlord at the age of eight, never having enough to eat or wear, and being beaten and scolded all day long, all the teachers and students in the audience were moved to tears. Huang Ying, a female student from Class Six, spoke of her life herding cattle for the landlord as a child bride, and then thanked the Communist Party for saving her life. Class teacher Geng Zhen, who came from a landlord family, after examining his thoughts, asked to go home and lead the peasants to dig up the assets of his own family. After investigating thoughts, all the teachers and students of Wenxi Middle School resolutely separated from the landlords. Student Jing Hai, who came from a landlord family, wrote a letter to his parents, urging them to quickly bow their heads to the peasants and completely return the land and blood money to the peasants.
