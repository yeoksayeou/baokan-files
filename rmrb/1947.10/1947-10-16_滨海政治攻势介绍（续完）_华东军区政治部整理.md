　　Introduction to the Coastal Political Offensive (Continued)
　　——Compiled by the Political Department of the East China Military Region

　　(III)

　　(I) According to reporter Li Zhiyuan, using realities understood by the masses to conduct propaganda in Zhu Ting County about "Chiang's army is bound to be defeated," and using cartoons for propaganda during the wheat harvest are both good examples:

　　A. Coastal area, June 24th dispatch: "In the wheat harvest offensive in the southern and Sanyang districts of Zhu Ting Town, the use of cartoon propaganda has been very effective. For example, in 'Reversed Wheat Cutting,' there is a drawing of a poor person, holding his head in his hand, looking worried. Next to him is a drawing of a comrade of the Eighth Route Army supporting him. Below is written: 'The wheat is turning, poor folks don't fret, the Eighth Route is here to support you, the landlord just stares, if he harvests your wheat, he'll lose his head!' Another example is 'Warning the Landlord,' which shows an Eighth Route Army soldier holding a gun, pointing his finger at a big belly, saying: 'It's right for the poor to turn over, this is a principle that can be told everywhere, if you want to settle accounts by cutting wheat, feel your head to see what happens, if you cut the poor's wheat, we will resolutely kill you and won't forgive you. The method of killing: if we can't kill you in the daytime, we'll kill you at night, if we can't kill you in the fields, we'll kill you at home, if we can't kill you at home, the landmine in the wheat stack will explode, we're telling you this principle, it's up to you to decide whether to cut or not, if you want to be proactive, make contributions first by exposing the atrocities of Chiang's army,' etc. These drawings are also very vivid. Contrastive education is also very popular with the masses. For example, we said: 'In the past, the puppet troops wouldn't let us plant sorghum, banknotes were worthless, puppet troops wearing Japanese uniforms raped and looted everywhere, and soon they were finished; now Chiang Kai-shek also doesn't let us plant sorghum, one Chiang currency is worth more than one yuan of silver (Northern currency only needs six hundred yuan), the little barbarians also use American guns, wear American uniforms, and also rob and rape, Chiang Kai-shek is the same as the puppet troops, and will soon be finished.' The masses listened and nodded in agreement."

　　B. Zhu Ting County's experience in publicizing "Chiang's army is bound to be defeated":

　　Some time ago, the enemy did not allow the common people to plant sorghum on both sides of the highway and near the strongholds. The masses reflected: "If the little barbarians come, we won't even be able to plant autumn crops, what will we eat!" We then publicized: "The little barbarians clearly want to starve us to death, the year the Japanese devils surrendered, they didn't let us common people plant sorghum, now the little barbarians are also acting recklessly like this, the little barbarians are also about to be finished!" The masses easily accepted it. They said: "Isn't that right? The little barbarians have no ability, if they had the ability, what would they be afraid of if they planted bamboo poles at the base of the strongholds?" Some masses also reflected: "Six hundred Northern currency can be exchanged for one yuan of silver, but five thousand Chiang currency can only be exchanged for one (now it takes more than ten thousand to exchange for one yuan of silver), the Central banknotes are really not even worth burning as paper money." "What money? Dog fart money!" We then publicized: "Chiang currency is worthless, just like the reserve currency when the Japanese devils surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek is going to be defeated!" The common people thought it was very right. We also publicized that Chiang's army uses American weapons and wears American-style uniforms: "Chiang Kai-shek is selling out the country, making the Chinese soldiers look like nothing, in the past the traitors learned from the Japanese devils, now Chiang Kai-shek is learning from America." The masses reflected: "That's right! Look at that cowhide hat he wears, what does it look like? Chiang Kai-shek is the same as the traitors, he really should be defeated!" The enemy often spread rumors: "The district's ×× is in such and such a place, and was beaten to death, if you don't believe it, go and see! The corpse hasn't been buried yet!" "The Eighth Route Army has been driven to the northern mountains and bombed by airplanes!" We then called the person who was rumored to be dead to go to the high ground and shout: "I am ××, I am not dead, the enemy is completely spreading rumors." "The Eighth Route Army has wiped out Chiang's 74th Division in the north again!" "..." The masses' confidence in victory was enhanced, and they also understood mobile warfare. They reflected: "Isn't this the little barbarians clearly spreading rumors? In the past, the Eighth Route Army pulled away, who knew that they wiped out Chiang Kai-shek's housekeeping division in the north again. Now, don't look at the fact that the Eighth Route Army hasn't come over, but they still have some tricks." Using these methods to publicize "Chiang's army is bound to be defeated" has four advantages: (1) Starting from specific things, not empty talk about grand principles; (2) Coming from the masses, going to the masses—first collecting the masses' reflections, improving and synthesizing them; then turning around and publicizing them to the masses; (3) Refuting rumors by having the person who was rumored to be dead expose them is the most powerful, making the masses believe that what the enemy said was completely a rumor; (4) Grasping the key points of propaganda: "Chiang's army is bound to be defeated" and "Chiang's army is about to be defeated" summarize several facts and reflections to publicize to one point, which is to adapt to the masses and also improve the masses; learning from the masses and also leading the masses.

　　(II) To create a powerful political offensive, it is necessary to seize favorable opportunities, expand the internal contradictions of Chiang and the puppets, put forward specific policies, strike at the bad elements and win over the majority. According to Comrade Bai Tao's summary of the forty-day offensive, the following is extracted:

　　Rectifying the thinking of cadres and carrying out the masses' revenge movement are the decisive conditions for launching a strong political offensive against the enemy. Studying and mastering the internal situation of the "Returning Home Regiment" and formulating specific policies is the key to winning the offensive.

　　The political offensive is launched in the following ways:

　　1. Seize the opportunity, strive for initiative, such as seizing the opportunity when Chiang's 74th Division was annihilated, and crushing the "Returning Home Regiment's" attempt to re-offend by relying on Chiang's army. Combined with our victory in sweeping the "Returning Home Regiment" in various places, expand the propaganda. The printing machine in the front line constantly prints out the good news and leaflets, which are passed around in the enemy-occupied areas, and transmitted to the enemy's strongholds by means of sending messages and letters. When Zhang Lingfu's body and the wounded soldiers of Chiang's 74th and 83rd Divisions were transported across the Linyi-Tancheng Road, we then attacked again and put forward the slogan "Leave a way out to ensure safety" to create terror. When we discovered that the enemy was preparing to rob wheat and conscript soldiers, we immediately exposed it to alert the masses and issued a stern warning to the "Returning Home Regiment." When the enemy wanted to reorganize the "Returning Home Regiment," we immediately printed leaflets and wrote letters to mobilize the puppet troops, explaining "Don't be fooled, run away quickly." The enemy in Lijiazhuang originally planned to reorganize more than 1,000 people, but 800 people ran away in a few days. After our army annihilated the "Returning Home Regiment" at Poshitiao, the government immediately notified the villages with puppet troops to go and claim the corpses. The puppet troops and the "Returning Home Regiment" in other areas were very panicked.

　　2. The attitude should be clear, and the policy should be specific. Some people proposed in the propaganda "As long as you go home, everything will be fine." The "Returning Home Regiment" could not accept it because they had many concerns that had not been resolved, such as: what to do if they killed people, robbed public property, took guns, or defected? Therefore, methods should be proposed according to specific objects, such as: atonement, gradual compensation for stolen items, bringing back guns and people, getting rid of bad leaders, etc., and explaining how we will reward and be lenient. In this way, some puppet village chiefs handed over machine guns and small cannons to atone for their crimes. Followers who brought back guns were rewarded with 1,000 yuan by the government. In Mawaili Village, Donghai, 13 people brought back guns.

　　3. A letter movement.

　　4. Strike at the bad elements and win over the majority. Implement a terrorist encirclement of the worst elements: such as a raid to attack Wang Qixin's puppet village office, laying landmines, shouting to capture him alive. Wang Qixin was so frightened that he fled. The government issued announcements and wanted orders for bad elements, and wrote letters, erected wooden signs, and exposed their crimes, and made red and black lists, adding points according to their good and bad deeds, explaining that there would be no leniency if they accumulated five black points, creating a mental threat to them. Encourage the wavering bad elements to get out of the quagmire and escape as soon as possible. In this way, five puppet village chiefs were subdued. The puppet troops in general were registered in the wheat harvest. After the registration, it was announced that they must all return within three days, and those who were obsessed with their mistakes would have their wheat confiscated. The puppet troops called the register the "book of life and death." During the registration, they all asked to wait a day or two: "Let me go and call them back and try." The landlord on the battlefield ran sixty miles that night to call his son back.

　　(III) Wherever the armed forces go, the propaganda and influence spread everywhere. For example, in the "July 1st" offensive in Tancheng, more than 100 villages were expanded with armed propaganda, and dozens of villages were opened up as guerrilla areas. According to the Dazhong Daily on July 26, the armed forces in the northern area of Tancheng, in cooperation with a part of the Tancheng Independent Regiment, launched a political offensive day and night from "July 1st." In the past ten days, their footprints have spread all over the northern bank of the Yi River in Tancheng, on both sides of the Linyi-Tancheng Highway, and to villages more than ten miles away from the city, totaling more than 100 villages and more than 10,000 people. More than 20,000 propaganda materials, more than 200 slogans, and more than 100 newspapers were distributed. A letter movement was launched against the local bullies, with significant results. Tens of villages along the Maling Mountains were deceived by the enemy and fled to the vicinity of the highway. When our armed work team suddenly appeared in front of them, explained our policies, and exposed the enemy's conspiracy, the deceived masses suddenly realized the truth and have now mostly returned home. The masses' sentiments in dozens of villages in northern Tancheng are gradually stabilizing. The "Returning Home Regiment" and "Self-Defense Force" have disintegrated one after another under our political offensive. Currently, incomplete statistics in these three districts show that 147 people have been disintegrated and returned home, and 11 people in one district have fled south. Twelve of the fourteen members of the "Returning Home Regiment" in Shangzhuang Temple quit their guns, and the remaining two were also panicked and did not dare to do bad things. After the puppet village chief of Changbaling was captured by us, the remaining eleven all handed over their guns. More than 80 members of the puppet "Self-Defense Force" in Xuezhuang and other places are now only half left, scattered everywhere, afraid of being annihilated. The masses' confidence in victory has been greatly enhanced. Forty villages in the Quanyuan District are now all under our control. Currently, they are organizing the masses to defend their homes according to the specific situation. Dozens of villages near the highway have become guerrilla areas, laying the initial foundation for carrying out the struggle in the enemy-occupied areas in the future.

　　(IV) Eight armed distribution and propaganda groups that went deep into the Chiang-occupied areas distributed 200,000 newspapers and propaganda materials. The introduction of liberated generals aroused great fluctuations in Chiang's army. June 26th dispatch: "In the past four months, eight armed distribution and propaganda groups in five counties in southern Bin have broken through the enemy's heavy blockade, crushed Chiang's and the puppets' sudden 'encirclement and suppression' and 'sweeping up,' crossed the Shu and Yi Rivers at night, braved the wind and rain and hunger, and overcome all difficulties. From February to now, they have posted and distributed a total of 42,040 copies of the Dazhong Daily, 49,870 copies of the Binhai Rural News, 29,360 copies of the Binhai Pictorial, and more than 100,000 copies of various propaganda materials in the Chiang-occupied areas. Their distribution work has become a powerful bridge for the political offensive. For example, on June 5th, the Zhuting armed distribution group widely distributed newspapers and propaganda materials (especially newspapers introducing the liberated general-level officers of East China), causing Chiang's army to desert.

　　滨海政治攻势介绍（续完）
    ——华东军区政治部整理
    （三）
    （一）据记者李致远报导，在竹庭县宣传“蒋军必败”采用群众了解的现实进行宣传，在麦收宣传时用漫画宣传，对比都是很好的范例：
    甲、滨海六月二十四日电：“竹庭镇南、三洋两区，麦收攻势中，运用漫画宣传，收效很大，如“反倒割麦”上画着一个穷人，一手撑着头，似有愁容，另外旁边画一个八路军同志扶持着他，下边写道：“麦子要掉头，穷爷们莫犯愁，八路给你来撑腰，地主干瞅瞅，他收割你的麦，那就不要头！”又如“警告地主”上画着一个八路战士拿着枪，手指着大肚子说：“穷人翻身理应当，这个道理那里都能讲，你想割麦倒算帐，摸摸脑袋看怎样，如果你要割了穷人麦，坚决杀掉不原谅。杀的办法：白天杀不了你，夜里杀你，地里杀不了你，家里去杀你，家里杀不了你，麦垛堆里地雷响，这个道理向你讲，割不割由你做，要想积极先立功，揭发蒋军暴行”等画也非常生动。对比教育也很为群众喜闻乐见，如讲：“过去二鬼子不叫咱种高粱，钞票不值钱，二鬼子穿鬼子装到处强奸掳掠，不久就完了蛋；现在蒋介石也不叫种高粱，蒋币一万多元能换到一块钢洋（北币只要六百元），小蛮子也使美国鬼子枪、穿美国装、又抢劫、又强奸，蒋介石跟二鬼子是一样货，不久也要完蛋。”群众听了，莫不点着头称对。
    乙、竹庭县宣传“蒋军必败”的经验：
    前些日子，敌人不让老百姓在公路两侧和据点附近种高粱，群众反映：“小蛮子这一来连秋查子都种不上，还吃什么呀！”我们就宣传：“小蛮子明明想饿死咱，鬼子投降那一年，不叫咱老百姓种高粱，现在小蛮子也这样胡来，小蛮子也快完蛋了！”群众很容易接受，他们说：“那还假吗？小蛮子是没本事了，若有本事，就在据点根里种竹杆又怕什么呢？”也有群众反映：“北币六百元换一块钢洋，蒋币五千元才能换一块（现须一万多才能换一块钢洋），中央票真是连烧纸都不值。”“什么钱？狗屁钱！”我们又宣传：“蒋币不值钱，跟鬼子投降时候的储币一样了，蒋介石要败了！”老百姓认为很对。我们又以蒋军使用美械、穿美国式的服装、宣传：“蒋介石卖国，把中国兵摆弄得不象个样，以前汉奸学日本鬼子，现在蒋介石又学美国。群众反映：真是的！你看戴的那个牛皮帽，象个什么样，蒋介石和汉奸是一样的货，真该败了！”敌人常造谣言：“区里××在什么地方，被打死了，不信，你看看去！尸首还没有埋呢！”“八路都被赶到北山里叫飞机炸完了！”我们就叫被造谣的本人去高地喊话：“我就是××，我没有死，敌人完全是造谣。”“八路军在北面又把蒋军七十四师消灭完了！”“……”群众的胜利信心提高了，运动战也了解了。他们反映：“小蛮子这不是明摆着造谣吗？以前八路军拉走了，那知道在北面又把蒋介石看家的那个师消灭了。现在别看八路军没过来，反正还是有点子。”用这些方式宣传“蒋军必败”有四个优点：（一）从具体事情谈起，不是空谈大道理；（二）是从群众中来，到群众中去——先搜集群众反映，加以提高和综合；再回头宣传到群众中去；（三）反谣言用被造谣的本人去揭发最为有力，使群众认为敌人说的完全是谣言；（四）把握了宣传重点：“蒋军必败”和“蒋军快败”把几个事实和反映都归纳到一点去宣传，这也就是适应群众而又提高群众；向群众学习而又领导群众。　　（二）造成声势浩大的政治攻势，要善于抓紧有利时机，扩大蒋伪内部矛盾，提出具体政策，打击坏分子争取大多数。根据白涛同志总结四十天攻势摘出如下：
    整顿干部思想与开展群众复仇运动，是对敌开展强大政治攻势的决定条件，研究掌握“还乡团”内部情况，定出具体方策，乃是攻势制胜的关键。
    政治攻势以下列方式展开：
    一、抓紧时机，争取主动，如抓紧蒋七十四师被歼，击破“还乡团”依靠蒋军图谋再犯的企图，再结合我各地扫荡“还乡团”的胜利，扩大宣传，前方的油印机随时翻印的捷报、传单，在敌占区传来传去，并以捎口信、带书信等办法，传到敌人据点里。当张灵甫尸体及蒋七十四、八十三师的伤兵运过临郯路时，我再攻上去，提出“留后路保安全”造成其恐怖。发现敌准备抢麦、抓壮丁时，我即给予揭发，警惕群众，对“还乡团”提出严厉的警告。当敌人要整编“还乡团”时，我马上印传单、写信，动员伪属等，说明“别上当，快逃跑”。李家庄敌人原拟整编一千多，不几天就跑散了八百。我军歼灭破石桥的“还乡团”后，政府马上通知各村有伪属者快去领尸，一传数十里，伪属与其他地区的“还乡团”都很惊慌。
    二、态度要明确，政策要具体，有的在宣传中提出“只要回家就没事”，“还乡团”倒反不能接受，因为他有很多顾虑没有解决，如：杀了人，抢了公家资财，带枪去的，叛变的怎么办？所以应当依照具体对象，提出办法，如：将功赎罪、抢了东西慢慢赔偿，带回枪带回人来，搞掉坏头子等，并说明我们怎么奖励，怎么宽大，这样有的伪乡长缴出机枪、小炮来赎罪，随从分子带枪回来的，政府还奖一千元，东海马尾村就有十三人带枪回来。
    三、一封信运动。
    四、打击坏分子，争取大多数，对最坏的分子实行恐怖包围：如奔袭打击王其信的伪乡公所，埋地雷，喊要活捉他，王其信吓的逃了。政府对坏分子出布告，下通缉令以及写信，插木牌，揭发其罪恶，并制红黑榜，依其好坏添点，说明积了五个黑点就不宽大了，造成他们精神上的威胁，对动摇中的坏分子，促其脱离泥坑、及早逃跑。这样镇服了五个伪乡长。对一般“还乡团”在麦收中进行伪属登记，登记后宣布限三天一律回来，执迷不悟的没收他的麦，伪属把登记册子叫做“生死薄”，在登记时都要求等一两天：“俺先去叫叫试试”，战场的地主当夜跑六十里路叫回儿子。
    （三）武装所到之处，宣传影响到处传播，如郯城在“七一”攻势，扩大武装宣传百余村，开辟数十村为游击区，据大众日报七月二十六日载：郯北地区武装配合郯城独立团一部，从“七一”开始不分昼夜展开政治攻势，十天来足迹踏遍郯北沂河沿岸，临郯公路两侧，直到离城十数里的村庄，计共宣传百余村，万余群众，散发宣传品两万余份，标语二百余条，报纸一百余份，对土顽展开一封信运动，效果显著。沿马陵山西数十村庄群众被敌欺骗逃往公路附近，当我武工队突然出现在他们面前，讲解我之政策，揭发敌之阴谋，被骗群众恍然大悟，现已大部回家。郯北数十村庄群众情绪渐趋稳定。“还乡团”和“自卫队”在我政治攻势下纷纷瓦解，现该三个区不完全统计已有一百四十七人被瓦解回家，一个区十一人向南逃亡。尚庄寺十四个“还乡团”中即有十二人插枪不干，所余两人亦恐慌不敢做坏事，长八岭伪村长被我捕捉后，其余十一人全部缴枪，薛庄等八十多名伪“自卫队”现只剩下一半，四散各处，怕被歼灭。群众胜利信心大大提高，泉源区四十村庄已全部为我控制，目前正根据具体情况组织群众自卫保家。公路附近数十村已变为游击区，奠定了今后开展敌占区斗争的初步基础。
    （四）深入蒋后地区的八个武装发行宣传组散发二十万份报纸宣传品，解放将官介绍激起蒋军大波动。六月二十六日讯：“四个月来滨南五个县八个武装发行宣传组冲破了敌人的重重封锁，粉碎了蒋伪的突击“清剿”“扫荡”，往返夜渡沭沂等大河，冒风雨饥饿，克服一切困难，从二月至今在蒋占区内共张贴散发大众日报四万二千零四十多份，滨海农村报四万九千八百七十多份；滨海画报二万九千三百六十多份及各种宣传品十多万份。他们的发行工作已成为政治攻势的有力桥梁，如六月五日竹庭武装发行组将报纸、宣传品（特别是华东解放将级军官介绍等报纸）普遍散发引起蒋军逃亡。
