　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd: Amidst the continuous stream of victories in the all-out counter-offensive, liberated youths in the Northeast are jubilant and enthusiastically demanding to join the army to seek revenge and completely defeat the Chiang bandits. Following over 10,000 young people from Liaodong joining the army, another 10,000+ liberated youths from Songjiang have poured into the main forces. In nearly half a month, after repeated reviews and approvals in Bayan and Shulan, over 4,000 people have been admitted into the army. In Bayan County alone, 3,000 people voluntarily signed up for the army within a week. After repeated reviews, Wangqing County in Jilin Province selected 670 outstanding youths to join the army. Following 800 people joining the army in Yanji City, another 280 youths have gone to the front. In other areas such as the Western District of Helong County, 300 people rushed to sign up within three days, and in Ezhong, over 300 people rushed to the front in five days. Xu Qinshi from Zhongxin Village even mobilized her husband, Xu Fu, to join the army. Students from various schools also enthusiastically requested to go to the front. In addition to dozens of male students joining the army from Xicheng Middle School, 50 female students requested to go to the battlefield for service. After more than 10,000 youths joined the army in the newly recovered areas of Liaodong, recently, over 5,000 more people in counties such as Andong, Qingyuan, and Hailong have joined the army under the slogan "Join the Army to Avenge and Protect Our Homeland." In addition, after seeing the old folks in the new area cruelly trampled by Chiang's army at the front, the battlefield service groups from Mingshui, Jinzhou, and Yian counties in Western Manchuria were extremely indignant and immediately requested to avenge them. A certain unit has now approved 21 members of the group to join the army.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei, 2nd: Liberated peasants in various parts of Eastern Hebei are enthusiastically joining the army. Since the summer offensive, 38,000 people in Eastern Hebei have poured into the front lines, and six liberated regiments and twenty-two liberated companies have been formed throughout the region. During this conscription movement, heartwarming stories of fathers and sons joining the army hand in hand are common. At a mass meeting in Wuliyong, Ji County, 29 young adults and 18 women immediately signed up, and the more than 20 elderly people present at the meeting were not to be outdone and asked to return to the front. An old man named Ren Yiji said: "Quickly put my name on the list! I will also send two sons, don't look at me being fifty years old, I have more energy than the young lads!" As he spoke, he lifted a stone lock of more than eighty pounds to show his strength. Zhang, an old liberated woman from Mafang Village, Zunhua, personally sent two sons to join the army. When her younger son was not selected, she hurriedly asked the district chief to say: "Little Baldy is no good, call my eldest son to replace him!" At a mass meeting in Renkuan Village, Shunyi County, peasant representatives called on everyone to completely overthrow the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and ensure a good life for the liberated brothers. On the spot, 84 young adults joined the army. After the surrounding villages responded to the call, a total of more than 900 people officially joined the army and swore: "We will never go home until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated!"
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 1st: Five thousand liberated youths from Weihaiwei and Juxian have risen up to join the People's Liberation Army and fight against the invading Chiang bandits. An old man of fifty in Guanli Village, Weishi, firmly demanded to join the army, saying: "I have worked all my life, and no boss has ever treated us as human beings. Now that we have been liberated, can we let Lao Jiang come and treat us as livestock again?!" Despite persuasion, he finally took up arms. In Zhonglou Village, Juxian County, a platoon was formed in two days. The new soldiers shouted excitedly: "We will be our own squad leaders, carry our own guns, join the main force to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and protect our homeland."
