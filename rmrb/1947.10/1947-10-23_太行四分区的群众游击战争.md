The mass guerrilla warfare in the Fourth Sub-district of Taihang
In July and August, the militia and self-defense forces of the Fourth Sub-district of Taihang fought 168 battles, large and small, with the enemy, killing and wounding 124 regular Kuomintang soldiers, 347 miscellaneous troops, and 1,226 puppet self-defense corps members and local despots, for a total of 2,098 enemies. They captured 4 light machine guns, 154 rifles, 18 pistols, 14,362 rounds of ammunition, 210 hand grenades, 212 head of livestock, and other items and military supplies. Our casualties and captures were only 54, a ratio of 1 to 40 compared to the enemy.

Over the past two months, the first period (i.e., July) mainly involved supporting and cooperating with the main force in attacking strongholds, annihilating stubborn puppet forces, and recovering towns. In the later period (i.e., August), after the main force crossed the Yellow River to the south, we mainly used guerrilla warfare to besiege the enemy at points and along lines. We have achieved great success in this regard. Since the main force went south, the enemy has only occupied Daiwanggu Town on the Xiuwu-Jiaozuo Highway. Every time they came out to harass us, they were met with attacks from our local armed forces and militia self-defense teams. The experience of this period of struggle can be summarized in the following points:

I. Mass Self-Defense:

In this regard, Bo'ai County is the best. From August 21st to September 13th, the enemy in Jiaozuo launched more than 16 small-scale sneak attacks, each with more than 40 people, all of which were repelled by the militia self-defense teams. Their self-defense methods are:

A. Strengthening intelligence. First of all, establish a complete intelligence organization. Each village has an intelligence station with six intelligence officers, each joint defense unit has a sub-station with eight intelligence officers, the county has a general station, and the Chengguan District has an intelligence liaison station to connect the streets. In addition, organize several intelligence lines that transmit information once a day (combined with sending letters) under normal circumstances. Emergency intelligence is reported directly to the county headquarters as soon as possible.

B. Joint defense operations. The entire county is divided into 148 joint defense units based on natural villages and geographical conditions. Each joint defense unit has a commander and a political instructor (both district cadres). In the event of a situation, each village supports each other. For example, once the enemy sneaked attacked Shangtun, each village came to help as soon as they heard gunshots. The enemy stole two cows, but we took them back.

C. Extensive use of indigenous weapons. Bo'ai County has 629 indigenous guns and 91 indigenous cannons. 260 indigenous guns and 21 indigenous cannons have already been used. Liwa Village did not have a single gun. The masses spontaneously created nine indigenous guns and two blunderbusses. After the struggle against local despots in Luqiao, the masses spontaneously donated 87,000 yuan to buy 90 hand grenades, 10 landmines, and 32 jin of gunpowder. They are now making gun and cannon (a type of indigenous gun) racks.

D. Strict sentry posts. The people on guard and sentry duty all carry indigenous guns and set up indigenous cannons, making it difficult for enemy scouts to enter the village. Once, an armed plainclothes enemy just entered Guitun Village and was captured. Two bayonet-guns were found. Some sentry posts also combined with landmines. People from other villages were only allowed to unload the mines or lead them to detour after they were interrogated clearly.

E. Combining labor and military affairs. Establish a security zone on the edge of the enemy stronghold, where the rotating combat teams operate to monitor the enemy. Each village has sentries or scouts in front of the village, and everyone farms behind them. In order to prevent enemy attacks, the masses in Liwa Village concentrated on sleeping in three courtyards and helped each other in production. They organized all the village's livestock into twelve plows, plowing one mu of land equivalent to 2.5 jin of wheat, eliminating the village's wasteland. Guarding and sentry duty for one day and one night is equivalent to one jin of wheat. Finally, accounts are settled.

The development of mass self-defense and guerrilla warfare in Bo'ai County is based on the mass anti-traitor revenge and land reform movements. After the "class standing" at the peasant congress, the line between the enemy and ourselves was clarified. The masses' demand for armed self-defense was very urgent, and the leadership only organized, praised models, and spread experience.

II. Carrying out the explosion movement:

Jiaozuo has done a better job in this regard. From August 26th to 28th, the enemy stepped on 30 mines in three days, killing and wounding 25 enemies. Since the wheat harvest, only Wu Weiyuan, director of the Hebei Military Commission, has detonated 12 mines, killing and wounding 18 enemies.

In order to promote the explosion movement, they specifically held meetings to mobilize, explain the role of explosions, and exchange experiences. They also widely held small training classes to teach everyone how to plant mines, and praised and rewarded them at the commendation meetings to encourage everyone's enthusiasm for planting mines.

The reason why they were able to kill and wound more enemies was that they learned explosion tactics, were able to figure out the enemy's thoughts and actions, and set up landmines, turning the landmines into "living mines." Estimating that the enemy would take the cut wheat, they pressed the mine under the wheat bundle. Estimating that the enemy would eat apricots, they pressed the landmine on the apricot tree. Estimating that the enemy would pour grain into the earthen jar, they pressed the landmine in the earthen jar. The enemy was afraid of planting mines on the road, so they raked the road with a rake. They used pull mines. They set up scarecrows on the enemy's blockhouse that had been driven away, pretending to be sentries. Estimating that the enemy would pull out the scarecrow, they tied the fuse of the mine to the scarecrow's feet, and sure enough, the enemy was blown up.

Now they have created 31 kinds of mine-laying patterns, and 22 kinds have been used to blow up the enemy. Recently, each village has also divided the mine areas and assigned responsibility, and put forward three competition conditions: (1) Plant more mines, (2) Closer to the enemy, (3) The enemy cannot enter the house.

III. Organize rotating combat teams:

Xiuwu is better than other regions. Their 175 self-defense team members are divided into six teams, plus the main village militia, which frequently engage the enemy, playing a significant role. In August alone, they conducted 105 activities, killing, wounding, and capturing 56 stubborn regular troops and 38 puppet self-defense corps members. They seized 1 machine gun, 27 rifles, 8 blunderbusses, 4,825 rounds of ammunition, and a portion of other livestock, grain, clothing, and military supplies. They also armed and carried out local work, enabling 23 villages in the stubborn areas to make contact with us, 19 villages to become guerrilla areas, and 26 villages in the guerrilla areas to become base areas. The characteristics of their activities are the combination of fighting wits and courage with the enemy, and going deep into the enemy's flanks and rear. For example, recently on the Xiuwu-Jiaozuo Highway, they disguised themselves as puppet self-defense corps members and captured an enemy medical squad without firing a shot, which is one example.

The leadership also pays attention to the training of small-scale armed forces, especially the core figures. When equipping them, they combine the brave and daring with those who are good at planning, and do not easily transfer them.

They are very keen on capturing heroic movements. Every activity is immediately commended and summarized. The leaders promptly praise and reward them, and everyone is very enthusiastic about making contributions and actively looking for enemies to strike.

IV. Launching political offensives to disintegrate the puppet self-defense corps:

Xiuwu has done a better job in this regard. In August alone, 12 puppet self-defense corps members made contact with us, 58 laid down their weapons and refused to work for the enemy, and 12 handed over their weapons to us. The methods used to win them over are as follows:

A. Local cadres use social relations to spread the news of our victory and point out that Chiang Kai-shek is at the end of his rope, so that they will abandon the darkness and turn to the light. A model figure in this regard is Liu Ziqiang, the hero who killed the enemy. He can disintegrate stubborn and puppet personnel based on their thoughts and emotions, which is very effective.

B. Establish "merit and demerit books" for stubborn and puppet figures. Merits are marked with red dots, and demerits are marked with black dots. The slogan is "Record red dots, avoid black dots, and express your thoughts." A certain big local tyrant dared not see us, but told a basic mass member that he had too many black dots, so he quickly bought 30 rounds of bullets in the city and handed them over to us.

C. Organize the poor and hired peasants in our area to establish relationships with poor and hired relatives and friends in the stubborn areas, so that the masses in the stubborn areas can disintegrate the stubborn puppets.

D. Grasp a clue and gradually expand to a large scale; use established relationships to collude. The initial conditions can be lower, but gradually increase them. Resolutely strike those who are stubborn and cannot be won over to warn others.

V. Backbone Armed Support:

The militia self-defense team can drive away the enemy if they come out in small groups. If they attack in large groups, they can only be killed and wounded by landmines, and turned around in small groups. Only a larger force can immediately drive them back to their nests. From September 4th to 8th, the enemy in Jiaozuo attacked Bo'ai four times in a row, each time with more than 1,000 people (two regular battalions, one security regiment, and a part of the puppet self-defense corps), all of which were repelled by our backbone troops. In the last battle, more than 200 people, including the enemy's deputy commander, were killed and wounded, and the enemy gave up their ambition to reoccupy Bo'ai. (Su)

　　太行四分区的群众游击战争
    太行四分区民兵自卫队七、八月份与敌人大小战斗一百六十八次，毙伤俘敌正规军一百二十四名，杂牌队三百四十七名，伪自卫团奸霸一千二百二十六名，共计二千零九十八名，缴获轻机枪四挺，步枪一百五十四支，短枪十八支，子弹一万四千三百六十二发，手掷弹二百一十个，牲口二百一十二头，其他物件与军用品一部，我仅伤亡被俘五十四名，与敌为一与四十之比。
    两个月来，前一时期（即七月份）主要是支援与配合主力进攻据点歼灭顽伪收复城镇；后一段（即八月份），主力跨河南征，我们主要是以游击战争围困敌人于点线，这一点我们已获得很大成绩。自主力南下以后，敌人仅占领一个修焦公路上之待王孤镇，每一次出扰即遭我地方武装与民兵自卫队的打击。总结这一段的斗争经验有下列几点：
    一、群众性的自卫：
    在这方面，博爱最好，焦作敌人自八月二十一日至九月十三日二十余天连续小股偷袭十六次，每次都在四十人以上，均被民兵自卫队击退，他们的自卫方法是：
    甲、加强情报。首先是设全情报机构，各村设情报小站，有情报员六人，每联防设一分站有情报员八人，县设总站，城关区设情报联络站，联络各街；另外组织几条情报干线，平时每天传递一次（与传送信件结合），紧急情报即速直接报告县指挥部。
    乙、联防作战。全县按自然村地理条件，分一百四十八个联防，联防设指挥政指各一人（均区干部），发生情况各村互相支援。如一次敌人偷袭上屯，各村一闻枪声即来援助，敌人抢走两头牛，又被我夺回。
    丙、广泛使用土武器。博爱全县已有土枪六百二十九支，土炮九十一门，已使用过的已有土枪二百六十支，土炮二十一门。李洼全村无一支枪，群众自动搞起九支土枪，二个抉枪，芦桥斗争奸霸以后，群众自动捐洋八万七千元，买手掷弹九十个、地雷十个、火药三十二斤，现在正作枪炮（土枪之一种）架子。
    丁、严密岗哨。站岗放哨的人均持着土枪，架着土炮，敌探很难进村。一次敌一武装便衣刚进贵屯村，便被捉住，搜出八音枪抉枪各一支。也有的岗哨结合埋雷，外村来人盘问清楚才给卸雷，或引其绕道而过。
    戊、劳武结合。在敌据点边设警备地带，由轮战队活动监视敌人，各村在前边放哨或在前边村放坐探，后边大家种地。李洼群众为了防敌袭击，集中三个院内睡觉，并互助生产，把全村牲口组织成十二犋犁，犁一亩地折合麦子二斤半，消灭了本村的荒地，站岗放哨一天一夜折麦子一斤，最后算帐。
    博爱群众性的自卫与游击战争面的开展，是在群众反奸复仇与土地改革运动的基础上开展的。经农民大会“阶级站队”，明确了敌我界线。群众武装自卫要求甚为迫切，领导上只是加以组织与表扬模范，传播经验。
    二、开展爆炸运动：
    这一点焦作搞的较好，尽八月二十六日至二十八日三天敌人即踏响三十个雷，毙伤敌二十五人；自麦收以来，只许河武委会主任一人即响十二个雷，毙伤敌十八人。
    他们为了推动爆炸运动，专门开会动员，说明爆炸作用，交流经验。又广泛开小型训练班，教给大家埋雷技术，并在表功会上表扬奖励，鼓动大家埋雷情绪。
    他们所以能较多的杀伤敌人，是他们学会了爆炸战术，能够揣摸敌人的思想行动埋设地雷，把地雷变成活雷。估计敌人要拿割倒的麦子，便把雷按在麦捆下。估计敌人要吃杏子，便把地雷按在杏树上。估计敌人要倒瓦缸内粮食，便把地雷按在瓦缸内。敌人怕在路上埋雷，把路用耙耙了，他们又用拉雷。他们在已打跑敌人的炮楼上设草人人装放哨，估计敌人必拔草人，便把雷的火线拴在草人脚上，果然炸着敌人。
    现在他们创造的埋雷花样已有三十一种，炸过敌人的计二十二种，近来各村又划分雷区分工负责，提出三个竞赛条件：（一）埋的多，（二）距敌近，（三）敌人进不了家。
    三、组织轮战队：
    修武较其他地区好些，他们自卫队一百七十五人即分为六个队，加上主村民兵经常接敌活动，作用很大。仅八月份即活动一百零五次，毙伤俘顽正规军五十六人，伪自卫团三十八人，缴获机枪一挺，步枪二十七支，抉枪八支，子弹四千八百二十五发，其他牲口粮食衣物及军用品一部。并武装开展地方工作，使顽占区二十三个村与我接头，十九个村变为游击区，游击区二十六个村变为根据地。他们活动的特点是与敌人斗智，斗勇结合，深入敌人侧背。如近来在修焦公路上伪装伪自卫团，一枪未发俘敌一个卫生中队，便是一例。
    领导上对于小型武装的培养也很注意，特别是核心人物，在配备时，把勇敢敢干的与善于计划的结合起来，不轻易调动。
    对于立功运动抓得很紧，每一活动，即时表功总结，领导上及时表扬奖励，大家立功劲头很大，积极主动寻找敌人打击。
    四、开展政治攻势，瓦解伪自卫团：
    这一工作也是修武较好，仅八月份伪自卫团与我接头的即十二人，放下武器不干的五十八人，向我交出武器的十二人。其争取方法如下：
    甲、本地干部利用社会关系传播我们的胜利消息，指出蒋匪末路，使其弃暗投明。在这方面的模范人物是杀敌英雄刘自强，他能根据顽伪人员的思想、情绪进行瓦解，收效甚大。
    乙、给顽伪人物立“功过簿”，有功记红点，有过记黑点。提的口号是“记红点、免黑点，各表心思。”某大恶霸不敢见我们的面，向一个基本群众说他的黑点多，便赶快在城内买了三十排子弹给我们交来。
    丙、组织我们地区的贫雇群众，与顽占区的贫雇亲朋建立关系，使顽占区的群众向顽伪进行瓦解。
    丁、抓住一点线索，逐渐向大扩展；利用已建立的关系进行串通。开始条件低些亦可，慢慢提高。对顽固不可争取者坚决给以打击，以警告其他。
    五、基干武装的撑腰：
    敌人小股出来，民兵自卫队是可以把他打跑的。假如大股进攻，只能用地雷杀伤，与小股扭转，非较大部队不能立即将其打返原巢。九月四日至八日，焦作敌人连向博爱进攻四次，每次均在千人以上（两个正规营、一个保安团、伪自卫团一部），都被我基干部队击退。最后一次毙伤其副团长以下二百多人，敌人才放弃重占博爱的野心。（苏）
