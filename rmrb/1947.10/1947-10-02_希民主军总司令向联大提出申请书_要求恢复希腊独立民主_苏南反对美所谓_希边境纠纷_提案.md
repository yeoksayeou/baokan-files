　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. TASS special correspondent reports: All delegates to the United Nations General Assembly are paying close attention to the application submitted to the UN General Assembly signed by Markos, Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Democratic Army. The application points out: "Greece today has no national independence and no democracy. This is due to the interference of British and American foreign forces and intervention in internal affairs." The application requests that "the United Nations General Assembly take measures to restore peace, independence, and democracy in Greece, stop British and American intervention, and give the Greek people the opportunity to freely decide what kind of government they need." The statement concludes by denying the representatives of the reactionary Greek government and requests that special representatives sent by the Greek Democratic Army be allowed to participate in the General Assembly to express their opinions.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 30th. For the past five days (24th to 28th), various committees of the UN General Assembly have held meetings. The Political and Security Committee began discussing the so-called Greek border dispute issue. The US representative insisted on its views in the Security Council, falsely accusing Southern, Bulgarian and Albanian countries of aiding Greek guerrillas, and suggested that the General Assembly establish a permanent special committee to "investigate" the facts and "supervise" the resolution of the so-called "disputes" arising therefrom, attempting to legalize its conspiracy to interfere in the internal affairs of Southern, Bulgarian and Albanian countries. Soviet representative Gromyko firmly opposed this proposal, believing that the Greek civil war was the result of the Greek government's implementation of fascist policies, and that the American enslavement of Greece and its aid and intervention in the reactionary Greek government caused today's serious situation. Gromyko requested that the General Assembly establish a special committee to supervise foreign economic assistance to the Greek government and suggested the withdrawal of foreign troops from Greece so that the Greek government could establish normal relations with its neighboring countries. The Yugoslav representative strongly protested the US representative's proposal, believing that the "proposal would only make the situation worse." During the meeting of the Economic and Financial Committee, Polish representative Wen Yan severely criticized the Marshall Plan for undermining the authority of the United Nations, demanding that the United Nations condemn it for the true economic recovery of Europe, and calling on "all countries not to participate in any economic plans outside the United Nations."

　　希民主军总司令向联大提出申请书
  　要求恢复希腊独立民主
  　苏南反对美所谓“希边境纠纷”提案
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社特派记者报导：联合国大会各代表均极注意希腊民主军总司令马科斯署名递交联合国大会的申请书。该申请书指出：“希腊今天已没有国家的独立，没有民主。这是由于英美外国势力的干涉，和干与内政所致。”声请书要求“联合国大会采取措施，以恢复希腊的和平、独立和民主，停止英美的干与，并给予希腊人民自由决定其需要何种政府的机会。”声明书在结语中否认希腊反动政府的代表；并要求允许希腊民主军所派特别代表参加联大，以表明他们的意见。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】成功湖讯：五天来（二十四至二十八）联大各小组委员会均举行会议。政治安全委员会开始讨论所谓希腊边境纠纷问题。美代表仍坚持其在安理会中之意见，诬指南、保、阿三国援助希腊游击队，建议大会成立一个永久性的特别委员会去“调查”事实，“监督”因此而引起的所谓“纠纷”的解决，图使其干涉南、保、阿三国内政的阴谋得以合法化。苏联代表葛罗米柯坚决反对此一提案，认为希腊内战为希腊政府实行法西斯政策的结果，而美国对希腊的奴役以及对反动希腊政府的援助与干涉造成了今天严重的情势。葛氏要求联大成立一个特别委员会，以监督外国对希腊政府的经济援助，并建议撤退希腊的外国驻军，使希腊政府与其邻国建立正常关系。南斯拉夫代表强烈抗议美代表之此一建议，认为该“建议仅能使形势更趋恶化”。经济财政委员会开会时，波兰代表闻言痛斥马歇尔对欧计划破坏联合国威信，要求联合国为了欧洲的真正经济复兴而予以谴责，并号召“各国不要参加联合国以外的任何经济计划。”
