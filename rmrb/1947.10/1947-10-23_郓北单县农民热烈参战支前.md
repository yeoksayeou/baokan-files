[This report from the Jilu Yu Border Region, dated the 21st] The masses in Yunbei are working day and night to cooperate with the East China Field Army in its operations. The Yunbei County Command, knowing that many wounded soldiers would pass through Yunbei, has established five more food and lodging stations. Each station has several village stations, two water stations, and one grain station, preparing 20,000 jin of white flour and over 25,000 eggs daily. When wounded soldiers pass through each station, they are immediately distributed to nearby village stations. This dispersal ensures thorough care and facilitates shelter from rain and air raids. Secondly, the entire county has provided 1,500 stretchers, 200 carts, and over 500 laborers. In addition, due to the rainy weather, supplies are generally transported by people, requiring over 3,000 people daily. Furthermore, the northern part of the county is near the river, with three dangerous sections and two large ferries, requiring over 5,000 people daily for emergency repairs and dike protection. In total, the county has over 25,000 people participating in the war effort daily, but they have no complaints and are working happily. Hou Temple East Street is a small village of about 70 households. In addition to enthusiastically providing stretchers and laborers, they have also voluntarily prepared six people to wait at the crossroads every night to guide the way. All of this reflects the love of the masses in Henan for their own troops.

[This report from the Jilu Yu Border Region, dated the 21st] Last month, during the battle of Tushanji in Cao County, the East China Field Army notified Shan County to immediately provide 1,000 stretchers. County Magistrate Liu personally went to each district to mobilize them. Before dusk, stretchers from all districts had arrived at the county government. County Magistrate Liu personally led them forward in the rain. Before these 1,000 stretchers departed, there were already 3,000 stretchers on the front lines. At the same time, the entire county also needed to send over 50,000 jin of rice and over 10,000 chi of cloth daily, with over 1,000 laborers on standby. In total, this required over 25,000 people, but the morale of the masses was very high. They all recognized that by contributing their efforts to defeat Chiang Kai-shek sooner, peace could come one day earlier. Therefore, many people on the front lines insisted on completing their tasks without returning home even when they were sick. Many laborers wrote letters home, telling their families not to worry about them, that soldiers shed blood and laborers sweat, all striving to jointly complete the counter-offensive mission. Women also wrote letters and sent messages to their husbands or sons at the front, urging them not to return home until they had completed their tasks, and telling them that at home, milling rice and grinding flour, taking care of the wounded, and the autumn harvest and wheat planting were all well-organized throughout the village, ensuring that nothing would be delayed.

　　郓北单县农民热烈参战支前
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】郓北群众为配合华东野战军作战，日夜忙碌。郓北县指挥部，为了伤员大多从郓北路过，因此又建立了五个食宿站，每个食宿站下设几个村站，两个水站，一个粮站，每天准备两万斤白面，两万五千多鸡子。每当伤号路过每个食宿站时，他们马上分到附近村站去，这样分散，既照顾周到，且又容易避雨与避空袭。其次，全县共出担架一千五百付，大车二百辆，民夫五百多人。此外运输给养方面，因雨水关系，一般用人挑，每天即需三千人以上，再加该县北部靠河，有三处险工，两个大渡口，每天抢险护堤，还需五千多人，总计全县每天参战人数达二万五千人以上，但他们毫无怨言，都是愉快的工作着，侯寺东街是个七十来户的小村，除热烈出担架民夫外，他们还自动准备了六个人，每晚在路口上等待带路，这些都反映出我河南群众，对自己的队伍，是如何的热爱。
    【本报冀鲁豫廿一日电】华东野战军上月在曹县土山集战斗中，通知单县马上到达担架一千付，该县刘县长当着人到各区去，黄昏前各区担架已赶至县府，由刘县长亲自带领冒雨前进，在这一千付担架未出发前，已经有三千付担架在前线上，同时全县每天还需送米五万余斤，送布万余尺，常备民夫已有一千余人，这样总共需用二万五千人以上，但群众情绪非常高，他们都认识：大家出力早打下蒋介石，和平能早一天来到。因此前线许多人发病还坚持完不成任务不回家，许多民夫给家写信要家里不要挂念，当兵的流血当民夫流汗，为共同完成反攻任务的努力。妇女们也纷纷写信捎口信给前方丈夫或儿子，要他们完不成任务不要回家，并且告诉他们在家碾米磨面，照顾伤员、秋收种麦全村都组织好了，保证啥也误不了。
