[Reported by our correspondent from Licheng] Labor hero Wang Fengqi of Xia Village, First District, convened a technical committee meeting on September 21st to discuss seed selection. Wang Fengqi said, "For strong mothers and fat lambs, seed selection is most important." During the discussion, it was pointed out that in the past, everyone selected their own seeds, and some did not preserve the seeds well. Every year when the masses plant, they either don't have seeds or exchange them back and forth, either failing to exchange or exchanging for poor quality seeds, hindering increased production. This year, we must conduct unified selection through mutual aid teams, with technicians personally selecting seeds for the masses. Each team will establish a seed storage facility. The method for establishing it is based on each household's amount of land cultivated, contributing grain as shares. Then, based on the opinions of the masses, selection and harvesting will be unified. After selecting and drying the seeds, the grain from the seed storage will be used to exchange back the seeds (in addition to a pound-for-pound exchange, seed-selected households will receive an additional 10 percent). The seeds will be stored, and when it's time to plant, the mutual aid team will uniformly disinfect and distribute the seeds to the masses. This will save trouble, enable the planting of good seeds, and solve the difficulty of seed exchange. Based on the needs of the entire village, ten seed storage facilities will be established this year, with a planned selection and storage of twelve *shi* of pure-bred Golden Queen corn, fifty *shi* of 811 millet (to be adjusted to other districts besides self-use), and twenty *shi* of buckwheat seeds. Ten *shi* of various grain seeds are planned. Each team is currently making preparations.

[Reported by our correspondent from Lucheng] The county government recently issued instructions, calling on the entire county to universally conduct field seed selection to lay the foundation for next year's agricultural production. It also specifically organized a force of fourteen people, including comrades from the Construction Section, the County Farm, district construction assistants, and extension workers from the Central Agricultural and Forestry Bureau stationed in this county, to convene central technical committee meetings in various districts to arrange and study the technical aspects of field seed selection. Each village must carefully select enough pure seeds for its own use and prevent the Golden Queen corn and other superior varieties from degenerating further. Now, the technical committees of each joint defense and village are actively promoting this work in conjunction with the current autumn harvest and wheat planting. Elder expert Liu Jubao said, "Seed selection is the most important thing for us farmers, as the saying goes, 'strong mothers produce fat lambs'." He put forward the slogan: "Carefully select seeds in the field, and crops will be free from disease. Select good seeds this year, and they will take root next year."

　　母壮羔肥选种要紧
  　霞庄建立种子仓
  　潞城县府号召田间选种
    【本报黎城讯】一区霞庄劳英王逢奇，于九月廿一日召开技术委员会会议，研究选种，王逢奇说：“母壮羔肥，选种最要紧。”讨论中提出过去选种，各人选各人，有的选下种子也保存不好，群众每年下种时总是没种，来回换，不是换不上，就是换些不好种，妨碍增产。今年要以互助组统一进行，技术员亲自给群众选，各组建立种子仓，建立办法是根据各人家种地多少入股（粮），再根据群众意见，统一选收，选出晒干后，用种子仓的粮，去兑换回来（除斤换斤外，给被选种子户加百分之十）保存，将来种时，由互助组统一消毒，发给群众种，这样既省事，又能种好种，解决了换种困难。根据全村需要，今年要建立十个种子仓，共计划选收金皇后纯种十二石，八一一谷五十石（除自己用外向外区调剂），荞麦种二十石。各种谷种十石，现各组正进行准备。

    【本报潞城讯】县府于日前发出指示：号召全县普遍进行田间选种，给明年农业生产打下基础。并具体组织力量，有建设科、县农场、各区建助和中心农林局驻本县推广员同志共十四人，分头到各区召开中心技委会议，布置与研究田间选种工作技术。各村都要精选足够本村使用的纯种，绝不让金皇后玉茭优种再退化下去。现在各联防各村的技委会，都在结合当前秋收赶麦积极推动这一工作。刘聚宝老能手说：“选种是咱庄稼人第一桩大事情，俗语母壮羔亦肥。”提出口号：田间精选种，庄稼没有病，今年选好种，明年扎下根。
