Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—Simultaneous with the Chiang bandits' Executive Yuan Information Bureau Director Dong Xianguang and all his propaganda organs repeatedly clamoring and intimidating the China Democratic League at the beginning of this month, the Associated Press reported from Nanjing on the 12th that Chiang Kai-shek had shot and killed Mr. Du Bincheng, a member of the Central Executive Committee and head of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, in Xi'an on the 7th. Nineteen others were killed at the same time. Mr. Du was a renowned educator over 60 years old, respected by the people of the Northwest. Before his death, he was the chairman of the joint edition of the Xi'an Qinfeng Industry and Commerce Newspaper. As early as May of last year, after the Chiang bandits shot and killed the leaders of the China Democratic League, Wang Ren and Li Furen (Li was later rescued and escaped), and closed the newspaper, Mr. Du was placed under house arrest and lost his freedom. On March 20th of this year, he was officially arrested and detained by the Xi'an Garrison Command of the Chiang bandits. Without a formal trial, he was falsely accused of "selling opium" and being a member of the "CCP Guanzhong District Committee" and executed. During this period, the China Democratic League repeatedly protested to Chiang Kai-shek and attempted to rescue him, but to no avail. The murder of this old educator marks the degree of frenzy to which the Chiang bandits, at the end of their rope, have reached in arresting and massacring democrats. Since the end of last month, the Chiang bandits have launched another new large-scale arrest and massacre in their controlled areas. In Peiping, they arrested students from five universities and more than ten senior officials from the troops of the miscellaneous generals Sun Lianzhong and Li Zongren, and closed the China and Foreign Publishing House; in Shanghai, they suppressed the workers' anti-hunger strike movement with bloody massacres. From the 23rd of last month to the 6th of this month, more than 205 employees in the electricity, transportation, and department store industries were arrested and beaten. This new wave of arrests and massacres by the Chiang bandits was carried out directly under the instigation of U.S. imperialism. For example, Yu Xinqing, from the troops of the miscellaneous general Sun Lianzhong, and another senior official were arrested after meeting with Wedemeyer (Associated Press, Peiping, 1st), which is powerful ironclad proof. According to various sources, the bloody butcher Wedemeyer, during his visit to China, ordered his lackey Chiang Kai-shek to use bloody massacres to extinguish all patriotic and democratic movements in his controlled areas. The Associated Press also reported from Peiping on September 14th that Wedemeyer had stated that "the absence of anti-American movements opposing American aid" was one of the conditions for aiding Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war. After receiving the order, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, during and after Wedemeyer's stay in China, actively carried out the will of his American master and attempted to eliminate the patriotic and democratic movements in his controlled areas by various means. From mid-July to early August, a large number of professors were dismissed and students expelled in Shanghai, Kaifeng, and other places, and the public-funded student system was abolished, in an attempt to disintegrate the students' patriotic and democratic movement; at the end of July, more than one hundred members of the China Democratic League were arrested in Guangxi; on August 2nd, one week after Wedemeyer left China and issued a statement blaming the Chiang bandits for being "muddleheaded" and "incompetent," the Chiang bandits' Executive Yuan, after two emergency meetings, formulated the so-called "Measures for Handling Communists in the Rear," which was full of bloodshed, as an excuse to expand the arrest and massacre of democrats; in mid-August, in the Chiang-occupied areas of Northeast China, more than 2,000 innocent people were arrested and sent to concentration camps in Hankou on the charge of being "Communist suspects"; on August 14th, in Wuhan, more than 1,000 people were arrested at one time under the pretext of "checking household registrations"; at the end of August, large-scale searches were carried out in bookstores, printing factories, and cultural circles in Shanghai, and more than 20 people were arrested. Recently, another round of arrests and massacres has been launched in Xi'an, Shanghai, and Peiping. According to extremely incomplete telegraphic materials, since the bloody butcher Wedemeyer came to China and ordered Chiang Kai-shek to step up the suppression of the patriotic and democratic movement until recently, more than 3,300 people have been arrested, imprisoned, and massacred in the Chiang-controlled areas. This bloody and deep hatred, carried out by U.S. imperialism directly ordering its lackey Chiang Kai-shek, will be forever remembered in the hearts of the Chinese people and has aroused more heroic and resolute resistance from the Chinese people. On the 3rd of this month, tram workers in the French Concession of Shanghai collectively and unarmed resisted the beatings and arrests by the Chiang bandit police; the heads of the trade unions resolutely stated that if one of their thousands of members was arrested, they would never resume work. The arrests and massacres by Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. will accelerate the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Under the thunderous offensive of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the day is not far off when the crimes of the traitorous Chiang family bandit gang will be judged and U.S. imperialism will be driven out of China.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—The Chiang bandits' increasingly intensified atrocities of arresting people in Peiping have aroused the heroic resistance of Peking University students. According to the Associated Press and United Press Peiping news, Peking University students began a three-day strike on the 12th to protest the recent arrest of ten students from the university by the Chiang bandits. More than 900 students at the university surrounded the residence of President Hu Shih on the evening of the 10th, demanding that he come forward to rescue the arrested students. Hu Shih stated in the courtyard that he was "unable to help." Currently, the Chiang bandits' atrocities of arrest are still ongoing. On the morning of the 12th, two more Peking University students and two middle school teachers were arrested. This strike by Peking University is the second strike by students in Peiping this month. On the 1st of this month, Yenching University students went on strike for two days to protest the arrest of students by the Chiang bandits.

　　血腥屠夫魏德迈唆使下
  　蒋贼疯狂杀戮爱国者
    北大学生英勇反抗开始罢课
    【新华社陕北十三日电】与本月初蒋匪行政院新闻局局长董显光及其一切宣传机构一再叫嚣恫吓中国民主同盟的同时，据美联社南京十二日电报导，蒋匪已于七日在西安枪杀民盟中执委兼西北总支部负责人杜斌承氏，同时被害的有十九人。杜氏系年逾六十的著名教育家，向为西北人民钦敬。遇害前任西安秦风工商报联合版董事长，远在去年五月蒋匪在西安枪杀民盟领袖王任、李敷仁（李氏后遇救脱险）及封闭该报后，杜氏即被软禁失去自由，本年三月二十日即被蒋匪西安警备司令部正式逮捕拘押至最近，未经正式审判，即诬指为“贩卖鸦片”及“中共关中地委”罪名处死。其间民盟迭经多次向蒋匪抗议营救无效。此一老教育家的被害，标志着日暮途穷的蒋匪逮捕屠杀民主人士已达到何等疯狂程度。从上月下旬起，蒋匪即在其统治区域内展开又一次新的大规模逮捕屠杀，在北平逮捕五个大学学生和杂牌将领孙连仲、李宗仁部下高级官员十余人，封闭了中外出版社；在上海以血腥屠杀镇压工人反饥饿罢工运动，从上月廿三日至本月六日内，就逮捕殴伤了电力交通及百货业职工二百零五人以上。蒋匪这一次新的逮捕屠杀，系直接在美帝国主义唆使下进行的，例如这一次杂牌将领孙连仲部下余心清及另一高级官员，系在与魏德迈晤谈后被捕（美联社北平一日电），即为有力的铁证。据各方消息透露，血腥屠夫魏德迈来华期间，曾命令其走狗蒋介石以血腥屠杀扑灭其统治区域内一切爱国民主运动。美联社北平九月十四日电亦报导，魏德迈曾表示以“不再出现反对美国援助的反美运动”作为援助蒋介石反人民内战的若干条件之一。卖国贼蒋介石奉命后，即在魏德迈留华期间及离华后，积极执行其美国主人意旨以各种手段妄图消灭其统治区域内爱国民主运动。七月中旬至八月初，在上海、开封等地大量解聘教授及革除学生，并取消公费生制度，企图瓦解学生的爱国民主运动；七月底在广西逮捕民盟盟员百余人；八月二日即魏德迈离华声明，责备蒋匪“颟顸”“无能”后一周，蒋匪行政院经过两次紧急会议后，即制订充满血腥气的所谓“后方共产党人处置办法，”作为扩大逮捕屠杀民主人士的借口；八月中旬在东北蒋占区以“共产党嫌疑犯”罪名，逮捕了二千余无辜人民解送汉口集中营，八月十四日在武汉以“检查户口”为借口，一次即逮捕千余人；八月底在上海大规模搜查书店、印刷厂、文化界二十余人被捕，最近又在西安、上海、北平展开另一次逮捕屠杀。据极不完整的电讯材料统计，自血腥屠夫魏德迈来华，命令蒋加紧镇压爱国民主运动至最近，蒋管区人民已有三千三百余人被逮捕监禁屠杀，美帝国主义直接命令其走狗蒋介石所进行的血腥逮捕屠杀，这一血腥深仇将永远铭记中国人民的心中，并已激起中国人民更英勇坚决的反抗。本月三日上海法商电车工人曾经集体的徒手的反抗蒋匪警察的殴打逮捕；工会的负责人曾经坚决的表示，他们数千人中如果有一个人被捕，他们将决不复工，蒋美的逮捕屠杀将加速蒋介石匪帮的灭亡，在中国人民解放军雷霆万钧的攻势下，审判卖国贼蒋家匪帮的罪行，驱逐美帝国主义出中国的日子已经不远了。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋匪在北平变本加厉的捕人暴行，已激起北大学生英勇反抗，综合美联合众社北平消息，北大学生已于十二日开始罢课三天，抗议最近该校学生十人为蒋匪逮捕。该校学生九百余人，曾于十号晚包围校长胡适住宅，要求出面援救被捕学生，胡适在庭院中表示“无能为力”。现蒋匪逮捕暴行仍在进行中，十二日晨续有北大学生两人及两中学教员被捕。按此次北大罢课系本月间平市学生第二次罢课，本月一日燕大学生曾因抗议蒋匪逮捕学生罢课两日。
