　　Military Supply Bomb Factory Carpentry Department
  　Squeezing Out Feudalism Leads to Increased Production
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The Military Supply Bomb Factory used to think that its composition was pure and there were no problems. Since the county government detained Zhao Liansheng, the special agent landlord manager of the carpentry department, the factory was immediately awakened and launched a Three Check-Ups Movement. Zhao Liansheng's true nature was revealed: he was a special agent in the past, cutting wires and spreading rumors. After Zhao infiltrated the factory, the leadership was temporarily deceived and assigned him as manager of the carpentry department. In his work, he put on a landlord's airs, established a small kitchen, ate and drank extravagantly, raped a local woman, did whatever he wanted in the locality in the name of the public, oppressed workers, deducted wages, and made workers eat rotten millet. In addition, he sheltered five landlords. When the masses came to demand them, he refused to hand them over, giving light work to the landlord workers and heavy work to those from peasant backgrounds. The workers dared not speak out. If anyone raised an opinion, he would immediately label them with a "political problem." The workers hated him to the bone. The five landlords were squeezed out and handed over to the masses. The carpentry department, having removed this rotten flesh, became active. The morale of the workers was high. Comrade Cheng Xiangting led the tree team to eat lunch without returning to the village. When the wood dried, in order to make it easier for the spinning team to spin, he soaked the wood in the river until dark before carrying it back. Yang Ji's splitting of handles increased from 1,100 per day to 2,000. Hu Xiangjin and Miao Zhenku's chopping of handles increased from 120 per day to 240. Han Fengliang's spinning of handles increased from 300 per day to 500. Old worker Wang Shicheng, who was over fifty years old, encouraged his fellow workers to work even when sick in order to exceed the task, and took out money to buy things for the sick workers. According to statistics, the number of wooden handles produced in one month was equal to the number produced in half a year under Zhao Liansheng's leadership.

    [This Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 5th dispatch] The Military Region Supply Department launched a class check-up and ideological check-up, deciding to stop landlords from using the air-raid shelters. The supply section of various stores cleansed forty-six landlords and rich peasants, detaining bullies and sending them to the government for transfer to their villages to prevent escape. Currently, further squeezing out is underway. In addition, many comrades from landlord backgrounds have deeply reflected, corrected their positions, and stood on the side of the peasants. Zhang Wenling, a cadre in the Education Section of the Supply Department, personally persuaded his father to bow his head to the masses and obey the disposition, and wrote to the district and village to express his support for the peasants' land reform attitude. Hao Pangqiu, the second manager of the Directly Subordinate Cooperative, whose family was being liquidated, requested the organization to declare his separation from his family. Liu Jinying, a salesman of Fusong Company, immediately wrote to his younger brother after learning that his family was being struggled against, saying, "Labor will certainly not go hungry or cold." He wrote to the village peasants' association saying, "I have no objection to my family being struggled against. If I am involved and need to return to the village to apologize to the masses, I will go back."

　　军供炸弹厂木工部
  　挤出封建产量激增
    【本报讯】军供炸弹厂过去一向自以为成份纯洁，没有问题。自县政府扣押了木工部经理特务地主赵连生后，一下惊醒了厂方，当即展开三查运动。揭露了赵连生的本像：他过去就是个特务，割过电线、造过谣言，赵自混进工厂后，领导一时受其蒙蔽，分配为木工部经理，工作中，大摆地主架子，成立小伙房，大吃二喝，强奸过一个民女，利用公家名义在地方胡做乱为，并压迫工人，克扣工资，叫工人吃腐坏的小米；此外他还庇护了五个地主，群众来要，他都不给，轻活给地主工人做，重活派农民出身的做。工人有苦难言，如谁提出意见，马上就拿“政治问题”的帽子扣你，工人恨之入骨，当将该五个地主，一并挤出，交与群众。木工部由于挖掉了这块烂肉，全部活跃起来，工人情绪高涨，程香廷同志领导出树班晌午吃饭不回村，木头干了，为了旋工班好旋，把木头放在河里泡透，至天黑才抬回来；杨记所劈把子由一天一千一百个增到两千；胡相近、苗振库砍把子由一天一百廿个增到二百四十个；韩凤良旋把子由一天三百增至五百；五十多岁的老工人王世成同志为了超过任务，鼓励工友带病工作，并拿出钱来给病员买东西吃。据统计一月生产之木把，即与赵连生领导半年生产之数目相等。
