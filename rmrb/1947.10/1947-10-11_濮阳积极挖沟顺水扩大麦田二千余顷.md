[This report from the Ji-Lu-Yu area, dated the 9th] Puyang has mobilized four thousand people to actively dredge ditches and use water to expand wheat fields by 2,700 *qing*. Within Puyang, the original Shang River had over ten *li* of collapsed embankment from Jiangdumiao south to Hualishang, causing more than 2,700 *qing* of land in the Zhaocunpo area to be flooded every year. Before the war, local people repeatedly requested the old government to dredge the river but were denied. Now, under the leadership of the democratic government, they are actively dredging the river. A total of more than four thousand people from the urban district and districts six and seven are participating in the dredging work. Before starting work, each district mobilized separately. Everyone unanimously recognized the importance of dredging the river and the implications for their own interests. Then, they discussed the working hours and work-life discipline in groups. In just three days, all the work was completed, totaling eighteen *li* in length and two *zhang* in width. The water from the originally flooded land has flowed down the river, and wheat can be planted soon. Guo ××, an old man over seventy years old from Geda Temple, said: "The Communist Party is truly planning for the people. In the past, it took a lot of effort to get this river through! Since the Communist Party came, the first thing it did was drive away the Japanese devils, the second was to lead the masses to turn over, and now it has dredged the river. We will no longer be flooded. We will never forget the happy life the Communist Party has brought us."

　　濮阳积极挖沟顺水扩大麦田二千余顷
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】濮阳四千群众积极挖沟顺水，扩大麦田两千七百顷。濮阳境内原有商河一道，自江渎庙以南至化里上十余里堤岸俱破，致使赵村坡一带两千七百余顷地年年被淹，战前当地群众屡向旧政府请求疏浚未准。现在民主政府领导下，积极疏浚河道，计城关、六、七三个区共有四千余群众参加疏浚工作。开工前，各区分头动员，大家都一致认识了挖河疏水的重要及对自家利害关系后，又分组讨论工作时间及工作生活纪律。仅三天，即全部竣工，计长十八里、两丈宽，原被淹地的水已顺河流下，不久即可种麦。疙瘩庙一位七十多岁的老头郭××说：“共产党真是为群众打算，以前这河费了多大劲也没弄通！自共产党来了，头一条打走了日本鬼子，第二条领导群众翻身，这又挖通了河，我们再不受淹了，我们一辈子也忘不了共产党带给我们的幸福生活。
