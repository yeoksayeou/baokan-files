Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd: The local armed forces of Lunan County, in coordination with the People's Liberation Army, advanced into the Teng (County) Yi (County) plains, sweeping away Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and the "Homecoming Legions." In ten days, from the 2nd to the 12th, they killed, wounded, and captured more than 1,500 enemy soldiers, recovering hundreds of villages east of Teng (County) and Zou (County), as well as the vast plains east of Yi (County). Currently, our army and county-level armed forces are active in the vicinity of the two cities of Teng and Yi, and the outskirts of Taierzhuang. The results of the battle are as follows: 1. The People's Liberation Army advancing into eastern Teng, with Fengmao and Dongguo (the location of the joint command of the Zou, Teng, Fei, and Si counties of the Chiang Kai-shek Xu [unclear character] Pacification Zone; previously mistakenly identified as the location of Chiang's Teng County Magistrate's Command) as the center, launched a sweep. From the 3rd to the 7th, they successively captured seven strongholds including Shangxia Huzu, Zhu Jiawa, Fengmao, and Dongguo, completely annihilating the special service battalion of the enemy's four-county joint command, and completely eliminating the local "Homecoming Legions," directly approaching the outskirts of Teng County. After the 12th, in the Shanting area, they counterattacked the Second Security Brigade under He Zhibin, which was transferred from the Qufu and Sishui areas, completely annihilating the Third Battalion and most of the First Company of its Fifth Regiment. The remaining enemy fled to the Sangcun line, and Shanting was subsequently recovered. 2. The People's Liberation Army advancing into eastern Yi (County), with Lanling Town as the center, began clearing the outposts on its periphery on the 2nd, captured Lanling on the 4th, and took advantage of the victory to attack westward, forcing the enemy to shrink to the Yi County and Taierzhuang line. A total of 450 enemy township chiefs and "Homecoming Legion" members were captured, and some were killed or wounded. 3. The Cangshan (new county) county local armed forces coordinated in an attack, beginning on the 2nd to sweep away the "Homecoming Legions" west of the Wu River, forcibly crossed the Wu River on the 3rd, and annihilated 261 Chiang Kai-shek township government armed forces and "Homecoming Legion" members. 4. Another unit of our army simultaneously crossed the Taierzhuang-Zaozhuang and Lincheng-Zaozhuang blockade lines, entered western Yi (County), and successively annihilated two Chiang Kai-shek township governments, annihilating and capturing 36 people including the township chief. Most of the area was recovered by us.

Xinhua News Agency, Jiaodong Front, 23rd: Chiang's army's attempt to reoccupy Weihaiwei City has not yet succeeded. The city has been in the hands of our army since it was recovered by the People's Liberation Army on the 9th of this month. On the 13th, a unit of Chiang's navy landed at Banyue Bay (six li northeast of Weihai City) and occupied Cotton Mountain (six li northeast of Weihai City) and Dongshan Garden (two li northeast of Weihai City). The Weihai City garrison forces of the People's Liberation Army bravely fought back, engaging in fierce fighting and confronting the enemy for three days and nights. By the 16th, the enemy had reinforced with more than 800 troops and advanced towards Gumoling, about three li directly north of Weihai City. Several enemy assaults were repelled, with more than 300 casualties. On the 17th, the People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to counterattack the enemy, with fierce fighting throughout the night, and recaptured Dongshan Garden and the highlands to its north. Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency has repeatedly reported that "the National Army captured Weihaiwei City on the evening of the 13th," and that "order in the city has gradually been restored," which is purely a consistent and shameless fabrication.

    【新华社胶东前线二十三日电】蒋军重占威海卫市企图迄未得逞，该市自本月九日为解放军收复以来，迄今仍在我军手中。十三日蒋匪海军一部在威市东北约十里之半月湾登陆占领棉花山（威市东北六里）和东山花园（威市东北二里），解放军威市警备部队当奋勇迎击，展开激战，与敌对峙三昼夜，至十六日敌增兵八百余，向威市正北三里许之古陌岭进犯，敌数次冲锋均被击退，伤亡三百余。十七日解放军乘胜向敌反击，激战彻夜，当将东山花园及以北高地夺回。蒋匪中央社连日报导“国军十三日晚攻占威海卫市”，“市内秩序已渐恢复等纯系一贯之无耻造谣。
