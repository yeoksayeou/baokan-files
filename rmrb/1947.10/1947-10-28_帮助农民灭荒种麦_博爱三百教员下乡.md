    Helping Farmers Eliminate Wasteland and Plant Wheat
    Bo'ai Sends 300 Teachers to the Countryside
    [This newspaper, Bo'ai News] Under the resounding slogan of "Reclaim Wasteland, Plant Wheat, and Produce More Grain to Support the Frontlines and Defeat Old Chiang," Bo'ai County has launched a campaign to harvest autumn crops, plant wheat, and eliminate both cultivated and uncultivated wasteland. All cadres from various government agencies are fully mobilized to go to the countryside to organize. The Bo'ai Elementary and Primary School Teacher Training Class immediately responded to the call from higher authorities, suspending studies for ten days and immediately organizing six propaganda teams, totaling 320 people, who were dispatched to various districts on October 14th to help the masses carry out a crash program to harvest autumn crops, plant wheat, eliminate wasteland, and conduct extensive propaganda. Before going to the countryside, all teachers launched discussions under the slogan "Learn from the Masses, Work Hard, and Strive to be a Model for All," resolving to go to the countryside to learn and transform their thinking. Subsequently, 29 groups were formed, with groups challenging each other. Wang Shaowang led a group that challenged Li Yunxia's group with the following conditions: (1) Do a good job in investigation and help organize village propaganda and liaison committees; (2) Read the newspaper and write mass blackboards every day, and organize a broadcasting station; (3) Everyone participates in mutual aid teams and actually works in the fields; (4) Learn in the work and honestly write good reflections; (5) No one asks for leave to go home; (6) Write slogans on every wall, clearly writing every sentence. This will be collectively investigated by other groups. In addition to resolutely accepting the challenge, Tian Wenming and Li Yunxia's group added a clause: "Reflections must be honest." Immediately following this, each group formulated challenge conditions, and their enthusiasm was very high. They departed for various districts that afternoon. (Jian Zhong)
