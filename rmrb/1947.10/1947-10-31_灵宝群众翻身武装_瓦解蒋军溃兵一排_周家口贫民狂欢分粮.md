Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan and Shaanxi, 27th: The Lingbao area's "Turn-Over Protection Corps" recently disintegrated a platoon of Chiang Kai-shek's defeated soldiers. This corps is one of more than ten mass armed forces belonging to the Lingbao Peasants' Turn-Over General Association. In just over a month, it has grown from eight members to more than a hundred. The participation of impoverished masses is extremely enthusiastic. An impoverished peasant named Zhao from a certain village, over fifty years old, also took up a gun alongside the young people to oppose Chiang Kai-shek and avenge his grievances. They search everywhere for defeated soldiers and war criminals, seizing the weapons of landlords and local bullies to arm themselves. Earlier this month, in Lizhuang, they confiscated more than ten rifles hidden by a Chiang Kai-shek appointed Bao head, Su. Gou Jiang, a railway worker who joined the corps, recently went deep into the mountains eighty li south of the city and disintegrated a platoon of defeated soldiers from the newly annihilated 1st Brigade of Chiang's army. Through political persuasion, they convinced more than thirty soldiers in the platoon to lay down their weapons, seizing two swivel machine guns, eighteen rifles, and three pistols. Another mass armed force, while searching for defeated soldiers, captured the head of a local reactionary security regiment and a company commander of the New 1st Brigade. Currently, the peasants in the new district who have turned over are actively establishing mass armed forces to protect the fruits of their liberation.

Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, 29th: On the day of the liberation of Zhoujiakou, an important town in southeastern Henan (the 23rd), thousands of starving poor people in the city demanded that the warehouse of the great local tyrant, bureaucrat, and landlord Li Shaoqu be opened to repay their blood debts. The democratic government firmly supported this. All the impoverished men and women in the city, amidst shouts of "Let's go to Li Ba Shao's [referring to Li Shaoqu] house to distribute grain!", eagerly rushed into Li's house. The road on New Street, where Li's house was located, was jammed with people. The joyful voices soared into the sky, even more lively than a Spring Festival celebration. From dusk until midnight, they completely distributed approximately 200,000 jin of wheat and other ill-gotten wealth from Li's residence. Li Shaoqu had served successively as a member of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Henan Provincial Assembly, an advisor to the Council, a secretary of the Henan Finance Department, and an advisor to the "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters of the Sixth District of Henan. Relying on his special power, he annexed hundreds of acres of fertile land and was responsible for many deaths.

    【新华社豫陕前线二十七日电】灵宝某翻身保卫队近瓦解蒋军溃兵一个排。该队系灵宝农民翻身总会所属十余支群众武装之一，月余来已从八个队员发展至百余人，贫苦群众参加者极为踊跃，某村一个姓赵的贫农老汉五十余岁了，也跟青年人扛起枪来反蒋复仇。他们到处搜捕溃兵、战犯，夺取地主恶霸的武装来武装自己。月初在李庄把蒋记保长苏某窝藏的十多支步枪缴出。参加该队的车站工人苟江等近又深入城南八十里之山中瓦解灵宝被歼新一旅的溃兵一个排，从政治上说服了该排三十余人放下武器，缴获转盘机枪两挺，步枪十八支，手枪三支。另一支群众武装在搜捕溃兵中，曾俘土顽保安团团长及新一旅一个连长。现新区翻身农民正纷纷建立群众武装，保卫翻身果实。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十九日电】豫东南重镇周家口解放的当天（二十三）下午，市内数千嗷嗷待哺的贫民，即要求打开大恶霸官僚地主李绍蘧的仓库，偿还血债。民主政府当予坚决支持，全市男女贫民在“到李八少（指李绍蘧）家分粮去呀！”的呼啸声中，争相涌进李家，李家所在之新街，途为之塞，欢声腾空，比春节赛会还热闹。从黄昏到午夜，把李宅小麦约二十万斤及其他浮财全部分光。按李绍蘧曾历任蒋匪河南省参议会议员、参事会参事、河南财政厅秘书、河南第六区“剿匪”司令部参议等职，凭借其特殊权力，兼并肥田百顷，害死人命多件。
