　　Competition to Rush Planting by Dividing Work According to Person
　　South Peak Masses Help Each Other Plant Wheat

　　[Our newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 19th dispatch] In Wei Huayuan and Ma Zhuang villages in the first district of Nanfeng County, and Xi Xiaozhai and Zhou Hai villages in the third district, men and women, old and young, are rushing to plant wheat, and have come up with specific ways to plant wheat without delaying war service. Currently, the difficulties in planting wheat are the lack of livestock and ensuring the completion of war service tasks, as well as the fact that late corn and beans should be harvested. The masses in Wei Huayuan said, "With so much work, if we don't think of a way, I'm afraid we won't be able to plant wheat in time!" Village instructor Wei Cunzhi heard this feedback and immediately held a meeting. At the meeting, according to everyone's requests, mutual aid teams were established, with a maximum of nine people in each team. At this meeting, livestock and farm tools were appropriately allocated (six cattle and two plows and harrows per team), and work was divided according to labor. The methods are: (1) Old people are not strong enough to do heavy work, but they are experienced in farming, and plow the land even better than young people, so they are specifically responsible for plowing; (2) Young and middle-aged people push manure to the fields, and when they return, they push corn, pull stone rollers, and pull drills; (3) Young and middle-aged women do odd jobs, such as grinding flour, fetching water, harvesting, and weeding; (4) Elderly women, children, and sisters' groups cut grass and do light work in the fields; (5) One village cadre stays at home, and the rest go to the fields to lead everyone in joint production. After everyone was organized, their enthusiasm was very high, especially in Xi Xiaozhai in the third district. Some time ago, mutual aid in autumn harvesting elected models, and this time they are also looking to see who is actively planting wheat and who is a wheat planting model. Shao Zhongjie's group wanted to take the lead, so they held small meetings every night to plan whose land to plant the next day and who would get up early to call everyone; they also put forward the slogan "Achieve Three Alike": First, get up alike: as soon as it dawns, you call me and I call you, everyone gets up, prepares wheat seeds, and feeds livestock to prepare for the morning; Second, eat alike: In the past, during mutual aid, a lot of work was delayed because the meals were not alike. This time, Jia Changdai's mother and village instructor Wei Qihe's family both said, "In the past, people were always not all there in the morning, all because our women didn't make meals alike. From now on, we all have to make meals alike." As soon as they saw the sun, they urged people door to door, and as a result, everyone ate very much alike; Third, work alike: This is mainly the role of women's meals being alike and getting up alike. Wei Huayuan issued a challenge to see who could do it faster. As a result, everyone's enthusiasm was even higher, and the women were pushing mills and husking corn at night. The first group husked the fastest, and two people husked twelve mu in one night. Elderly women and children were not to be outdone. Wei Zhencun's mother was sixty-eight years old and could cut thirty to fifty catties of grass in one morning. Children's League member Xiao Sancai was thirteen years old and could also cut thirty to fifty catties in one morning. Because the Children's League in Zhou Hai village cut grass, the livestock, although tired, did not appear thin because they had green grass to eat. Shi Jin's group in the Ma Zhuang Children's League had seven children, none of whom were over fifteen years old, and they cut six mu of beans in one morning and pushed half a dou of wheat in one day. Sisters' League leader Qiu Lian led the young sisters to push the mill. Guang Jinlan's group pushed one dou and four sheng in one morning. The young and middle-aged people pushed manure to the fields, carrying it back and forth, carrying either a cart of beans or a cart of corn stalks. The young and middle-aged people in Wei Huayuan were even more active, pushing manure every night. During the wheat planting period, Zhou Hai village tried to hold as few meetings as possible. Every night, the team leader reported the situation to the village cadres, and based on the report, broadcast it in a timely manner, and held a summary meeting every five days. Under the enthusiastic request of the masses to plant wheat early, Ma Zhuang can finish planting in three days; Dong Xiaozhai will take no more than seven days at the slowest, and Xi Dazhai has now planted 70 percent. However, under the call of the higher authorities to plant more wheat, the villagers are discussing planting more as much as possible. Han Qihe's group has planted eighty mu and is now increasing the planting by forty mu. They happily said, "As long as planting more wheat can help the counter-offensive victory, why not plant more!" Then, someone asked, "If we plant more, what about firewood next year?" One person said, "That doesn't matter, we'll plant one row every other row, and next spring we can still plant millet and sorghum in the empty space." When he said this, everyone felt that the method was very good. During the wheat planting period, in order to solve the combination of war service and production, the method of calculating work points was adopted. Each day is counted as a full work point, military dependents and revolutionary martyrs are counted as full work points, and those who perform war service are also counted as full work points, and it is proposed to plant the land of military dependents and those who perform war service first, so as not to make them worry about their families. War service is drawn from each mutual aid team. Sun Xiuzhi, a member of the Wei Huayuan Women's Federation, said, "It doesn't matter if the young and middle-aged people go to war. The elderly shake the drill, and our women help with the drill. Isn't it the same as planting wheat?" In Wulitun in the second district, production mutual aid was organized before May and June, and a total of eight groups were divided. Military dependents without labor were assigned to each group. They used the method of class grievances to encourage production enthusiasm. When there is a task of supporting the army, people are sent by each group, and production is the responsibility of each group. Their mutual aid division of labor is: women harvest crops, men pull plows and harrows, the elderly hold the plow, and children do odd jobs at home. Their method of pulling the plow is to allocate two manpower per mu. Now more than 70 percent of the wheat has been planted. In order to solve the difficulty of labor force and plant a large amount of wheat, Yin Zhuang uses human power to pull the plow, grind flour, and push manure when plowing. Each plow can plow four and a half mu of land a day; Wheat planting is divided into three mornings. In the early morning and afternoon, cattle are used to pull the drill, and people pull the stone roller. After breakfast, people pull the drill and the roller. They can plant 20 mu of wheat every day. They are working very hard. The masses feel that without mutual aid, eight or nine out of ten would not be able to plant wheat.

　　按人分活竞赛突击
  　南峰群众互助种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】南峰县一区魏花园、马庄，三区西小砦、周海等村，男女老幼突击种麦，并想出种麦不误战勤的具体办法。目前种麦困难是牲口缺乏及保证战勤任务的完成，又加上晚棒子、豆子都该割，魏花园的群众说：“活这样忙，要不想个法，恐怕到时候麦子种不上啊！”村指导员魏存志听到这种反映，马上开了个会，会上，根据大家的要求，成立了互助组，每组最多的是九个人，在这个会上，并适当的分配了牲口与农具（每组牛六头、犁耙各两张），又根据劳动力分了活。其办法是（一）老头出大力不行但种地有经验，犁地比青年人还强，专门负责犁地；（二）青壮年往地里推粪，回来推棒子、拉砘子、拉耧；（三）青壮妇女做零活，如磨面、打水、收割、锄草等；（四）老年妇女、儿童、姐妹团，割草、抱孩子做些场里的轻活；（五）村干留一人在家，其余的一样下地，领导大家共同生产。大家组织起来后，情绪很高，特别是三区西小砦，前些时互助秋收就选举了模范，这次又提前来看谁种麦积极？谁种麦模范？邵忠节组想占先，每天晚上开小会，计划第二天耩谁的，谁先起来叫；并提出“做到三齐”的口号：一、起的齐：天一发亮就你喊我我喊你，都起来，治麦种、喂牲口准备上晌；二、吃饭齐：从前互助时，因为饭不齐，耽误了不少的活，这次贾常代的母亲、村指导员魏启和家都说：“过去上晌时，人老是到不齐，都是因为咱妇女做饭不齐，往后咱都得一齐做饭。”一看太阳该做饭了，就挨门督促，结果吃的很齐；三、干活齐：这主要是妇女的饭齐，起齐的作用。魏花园提出挑战，看谁干的快？这样一来，大家的情绪更高了，妇女都是晚上推磨、剥棒子。第一组剥的最快，两个人一晚上就剥了十二亩，老年妇女和儿童也不甘落后，魏真存的母亲六十八岁了，一晌能割草三十斤到五十斤，儿童团员小三才十三岁，一晌也能割三十斤到五十斤。周海村因为儿童团割草，牲口虽累，因有青草吃，也没有显瘦。马庄儿童团史进那组七个小孩，没有一个过十五岁的，一晌割了六亩豆子，一天推了斗半麦子。姐妹团团长秋莲，领着小姐妹推磨，光金兰那组，一上午就推了一斗四升。青壮年往地里推粪，都是来回载，不是捎车豆子就是捎车棒子秸。魏花园的青壮年更为积极，天天晚上推粪。周海村在种麦期间尽量少开会，每天晚上由组长向村干汇报情况，根据汇报，及时广播，每五天开一次总结会。在群众积极要求提早种上麦子的情况下，马庄三天可耩完；东小砦最慢也不过七天，西大砦现已种上百分之七十，但在上级多种麦号召下，全村群众正商量尽量再多种些，邗启和组已种上八十亩，现在又增种四十亩，他们并高兴的说：“只要多种麦子，能帮助反攻胜利，为啥不多种呢！”接着，有人提出：“咱再多种了，明年烧柴怎办？”有一人说：“那不要紧，咱隔一耧种一耧，明年春天在空里还可耩谷子高粱。”他这样一提，大家感到办法很好，在种麦期间，为解决战勤与生产结合，采用了计工的办法，每天算一个整工，军工烈属计整工，出战勤的也计整工，并提先种军属与出战勤的地，免得他们挂家，出战勤是各互助组抽着出。魏花园的妇女会委员孙秀芝说：“青壮年都去参战也碍不着种麦，有年纪的摇耧，俺妇女帮耧，还不是一样种麦吗。”二区五里屯，在五、六月以前，就组织了生产互助，共分八个组，军属无劳动力的都分到各组中去，他们用了阶级诉苦的办法，鼓励了生产情绪，有支差任务时，由各组派人，生产由各组负责，他们的互助分工是，妇女收割庄稼，男子拉犁、拉耙，老年掌犁，小孩在家做散活，他们的拉犁办法是，每一亩配两个人力。现已种到百分之七十以上的麦子。殷庄为解决劳动力困难大量种麦，他们在犁地时，用一人拉犁、磨面、推粪都是用人力，每张犁一天能犁四亩半地；种麦分三晌，早晨过午用牛拉耧，人拉石砘子，早饭后是人拉耧拉砘子，每天能种二十亩麦。他们干的劲很大。群众感觉，不是互助，十有八九种不上麦子。
