　　French Troops Madly Invade Vietnam Again
  　Triggering a New Wave of Vietnamese Resistance Against France
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th] French imperialists' new offensive against the Vietnamese people has now begun in areas such as Tonkin and Hanoi. Vietnamese radio revealed this fact as early as October 9th, but the French side was still trying to cover it up at the time. Although the United Press International dispatch from Paris on the 6th stated: Hanoi heard intense artillery fire and bombing again on the 6th. However, according to Agence France-Presse's dispatch from Paris on the 9th, Parisian officials still "categorically deny rumors (?) that France has launched an offensive in the Tonkin region"; and claimed that French military actions were only of a local scale. French imperialists thought they could escape the world's attention and condemnation in this way, forgetting that fire cannot be wrapped in paper. Even Agence France-Presse's dispatch from Hanoi on the 15th stated: For the first time in many months, a French communique revealed: fierce fighting occurred between French and Vietnamese forces in Cao Bằng, in the extreme north of Vietnam. In recent times, in addition to continuing to play with the puppet regime of what they call Cochinchina, the center of their conspiracy has been placed on Bảo Đại, attempting to have Bảo Đại organize a puppet Vietnamese government and order it to attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In doing so, they transform the French war of aggression into a Vietnamese civil war. On October 10th, French Minister Pignon, in a speech in Hanoi, openly denied that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam could have an army, diplomacy, or currency, and did not recognize the government led by Việt Minh leader Hồ Chí Minh, which is loyally supported by the vast majority of the Vietnamese people. The French military offensive and political conspiracies have triggered a new wave of Vietnamese resistance against aggression and great concern from world public opinion. Prior to this war, the Vietnamese democratic government had submitted a memorandum to the United Nations, requesting the resumption of peace talks under the auspices of the United Nations. World public opinion is awaiting the UN's response. The Chinese people are paying increasing attention and showing sympathy to the Vietnamese struggle against France and the Indonesian struggle against the Netherlands. Because the destinies of these three Asian nations, China, India, and Vietnam, have many points in common.

　　法军又疯狂进犯越南
  　引起越人抗法新高潮
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】法国帝国主义者对越南人民的新进攻现已在东京、河内等地区开始，越南广播早在十月九日即揭露此一事实，但法国方面，当时尚力图掩饰。虽然合众社巴黎六日电即称：河内于六日已重闻激烈的炮声与轰炸声。但据法新闻社巴黎九日电，巴黎官方人士仍“确切否认法国在东京地区发动进攻之谣言（？）”；又称：法军行动仅属地方性规模。法国帝国主义者以为如此即可逃避世界的注意和谴责，而忘记了火是不能用纸包住的。至本月十五日法新闻社河内电亦称：许多月来第一次法国公报透露：法越双方在越南极北边的策昌发生激战。最近时期内，法国帝国主义者除继续玩弄其所谓交趾支那政府的傀儡外，他们的阴谋中心放在保大身上，企图叫保大组织一个傀儡的越南政府，并令其进攻越南民主共和国。由此把法国的侵略战争，变为越南的内战。十月十日法国公使波拉在河内演说，公然否认越南民主共和国可以有军队、有外交、有货币，并不承认越盟领袖胡志明所领导的为全越南绝大多数人民所矢忠拥护的政府。法国的军事进攻与政治阴谋，已引起了越南人民反抗侵略的新高潮与世界舆论的极大关切。在此次战端以前，越南民主政府已向联合国提出备忘录，要求在联合国主持下重开和谈，世界舆论正等待联合国之反应。中国人民对于越南抗法斗争和印尼抗荷斗争，正以日益增长的同情予以注视。因为中印越这三个亚洲民族的命运是有许多共同之点的。
