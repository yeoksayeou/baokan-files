　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th dispatch] The Qinyuan Fifth District borders the Pingyao and Jiexiu areas, and is constantly harassed by Yan bandit troops. In order to combine autumn harvesting and wheat planting with war preparedness, achieving the goals of quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick storage, quick plowing, and quick planting, mutual aid teams are being vigorously rectified. Except for Wanghe, Baicao, and Guiduan villages, 108 mutual aid teams have been restored in the district, with 997 participants, including 10 women's groups with 86 members, and 11 children's groups with 113 members. The previous deviations of unclear equivalent exchange, work points not being mutually convertible, and purely agricultural mutual aid have been corrected. In the team led by labor hero Sun Xueqian from Wutou Village, fixed points were evaluated per person by settling the work points for the first half of the year, and a reward system based on the work done was established, greatly boosting everyone's enthusiasm for labor. It was also decided that in order to achieve "harvesting one piece as one turns yellow," and "threshing one field after one is harvested," mutual aid teams should use multiple small threshing grounds, so that threshing could be done quickly. Joint defense was established with neighboring villages, and large-scale labor exchange was organized. Currently, the entire village has finished harvesting millet and planting wheat. The entire district also requires that field clearing and land cleaning be completed by October 20th.
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th dispatch] Ni Zhuang, a base village in Qinyuan Fourth District, does not forget to prepare for famine during the autumn harvest. On September 15th, the Shengfeng Mutual Aid Brigade in the village held a meeting to discuss the fact that this year's autumn grain would be insufficient, and a spring famine would occur next spring. While there were still substitute foods available in the autumn to remedy the situation, so as to avoid starvation next year, it was decided to start gathering mountain products to supplement the food shortage. The entire brigade of 85 people was divided into six groups, and in three days, they gathered 13 *shi* of *qian gejian* and 12 loads of *mogu*. After being commended by the district office, the entire base village was mobilized. According to preliminary statistics, all fifteen villages in the base village gathered a total of 65 *shi* of *gejian*. Jian'gan Village alone gathered 45 *shi*. Currently, the villages are continuing to carry out this activity.
