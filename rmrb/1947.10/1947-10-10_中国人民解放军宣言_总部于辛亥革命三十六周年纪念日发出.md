The Chinese People's Liberation Army, after smashing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, has now launched a large-scale counter-offensive. In the southern front, our army has advanced towards the Yangtze River basin, and in the northern front, our army has advanced towards the Middle-Chang and North-Ning lines. Wherever our army goes, the enemy collapses at the mere sight of us, and the people cheer thunderously. The entire situation between the enemy and us has undergone a fundamental change compared to a year ago.

The military objective of our army has been declared to China and abroad repeatedly, which is for the liberation of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. And today, it is to realize the urgent demands of the people of the whole country, to overthrow the instigator of the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek, and to organize a democratic coalition government, in order to achieve the overall goal of liberating the people and the nation.

The Chinese people, for their own liberation and national independence, fought heroically against Japanese imperialism for eight long years. After Japan's surrender, the people yearned for peace, but Chiang Kai-shek undermined all the people's efforts to strive for peace, and pressed an unprecedented civil war disaster on the heads of the people. This forced people of all strata across the country to unite and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, with no other way out.

Chiang Kai-shek's current civil war policy is not accidental, it is the inevitable result of Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique's consistent anti-people policy. As early as 1927, Chiang Kai-shek perfidiously betrayed the revolutionary alliance between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, betrayed Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three People's Principles and Three Major Policies, and since then established a dictatorial rule, surrendered to imperialism, fought a ten-year civil war, and caused the Japanese invasion. During the Xi'an Incident in 1936, the Chinese Communist Party repaid evil with good, and together with Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, released Chiang Kai-shek, hoping that Chiang Kai-shek would repent and start anew, and jointly resist Japan. But Chiang Kai-shek once again forgot gratitude and justice, responded passively to the Japanese invaders, actively suppressed the people, and was extremely hostile to the Communist Party. When Japan surrendered in 1945, the Chinese people once again forgave Chiang Kai-shek, demanding that Chiang Kai-shek stop the civil war that had already begun, implement democratic politics, and unite all parties to build the country peacefully. However, Chiang Kai-shek, who had no credibility, overturned everything immediately after signing the armistice agreement, passing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and announcing the four promises. Although the people have repeatedly exercised forbearance and sought perfection, Chiang Kai-shek, with the assistance of American imperialism, was determined to disregard the life and death of the country and the nation, and launched an unprecedented and comprehensive offensive against the people. From the announcement of the armistice agreement in January of last year (1946) to the present, Chiang Kai-shek has mobilized more than 220 regular brigades and nearly a million miscellaneous troops to launch a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas which the Chinese people had seized from Japanese imperialism with bloody battles, and successively occupied Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, Siping, Changchun, Yongji, Chengde, Jining, Zhangjiakou, Huaiyin, Heze, Linyi, Yan'an, Yantai and other cities and vast rural areas. Wherever the Chiang army went, they killed, burned, raped, and plundered, implementing the "three alls" policy, which was exactly the same as the behavior of Japanese bandits. In November of last year, Chiang Kai-shek convened the pseudo-National Assembly and announced the pseudo-constitution. In March of this year, Chiang Kai-shek expelled the representatives of the Communist Party. In July of this year, Chiang Kai-shek issued a general mobilization order against the people. For just popular movements throughout the country against civil war, against hunger, and against American imperialist aggression, and for the struggle for survival of workers, peasants, students, urban residents, and public education personnel, Chiang Kai-shek's policy is suppression, arrest, and slaughter. For all ethnic minorities in the country, Chiang Kai-shek's policy is to implement Han chauvinism, and to destroy and suppress them in every possible way. In all Chiang Kai-shek's ruling areas, corruption is rampant, secret agents are rampant, taxes are heavy, prices are soaring, the economy is bankrupt, all industries are depressed, conscription and grain requisition are rampant, and complaints are everywhere, which puts the vast majority of people across the country in deep water. And the financial oligarchs, corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, have concentrated huge wealth. Taking only the four major families of Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, and the Chen Lifu brothers, the public and private property they have seized is worth more than one billion US dollars. These properties were all obtained by Chiang Kai-shek through his dictatorial powers, extortion and embezzlement. In order to maintain his dictatorship and carry out the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek did not hesitate to sell national rights to foreign imperialism; colluded with American troops to stay in Qingdao and other places; recruited advisors from the United States to participate in the command and training of the civil war and to kill his own compatriots; airplanes, tanks, guns and ammunition for the civil war were shipped in large quantities from the United States; the funds for the civil war were shipped in large quantities from the United States; and he used the sale of military bases, the sale of air and sea rights, and the signing of servile commercial treaties, which were more serious than Yuan Shikai's traitorous behavior, as gifts to reward American imperialism. In short, Chiang Kai-shek's twenty years of rule have been a rule of treason, dictatorship, and anti-people. Today, the vast majority of people across the country, regardless of north or south, young or old, have recognized Chiang Kai-shek's monstrous crimes, and look forward to our army's speedy counter-offensive, overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek, and liberating all of China.

Our army is the army of the Chinese people, and everything is based on the will of the Chinese people. The policies of our army represent the urgent demands of the Chinese people, mainly including the following:

(1) Unite workers, peasants, soldiers, students, businessmen, all oppressed classes, all people's organizations, all democratic parties, all ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese from all regions, and other patriotic elements to form a national united front, overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government, and establish a democratic coalition government.

(2) Arrest, try and punish Chiang Kai-shek and other war criminals who instigated the civil war.

(3) Abolish the dictatorial system under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, implement a people's democratic system, and guarantee the people's freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association.

(4) Abolish the corrupt system under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, eliminate corrupt officials, and establish a clean government.

(5) Confiscate the property of Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, the Chen Lifu brothers and other major war criminals, confiscate bureaucratic capital, develop national industry and commerce, improve the lives of workers and staff, and provide relief to disaster victims and the poor.

(6) Abolish the feudal exploitation system, implement the system of "land to the tiller," and distribute rural land equally among the rural people according to the population and the quantity and quality of the land, and have them own it.

(7) Recognize the rights of all ethnic minorities within China to equal autonomy and freedom to join the Chinese Federation.

(8) Deny all traitorous diplomacy of the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government, abolish all traitorous treaties, deny all foreign debts borrowed by Chiang Kai-shek during the civil war, demand that the US government withdraw its troops stationed in China that threaten China's independence, oppose any foreign aid to Chiang Kai-shek to fight the civil war and revive Japanese aggression forces, sign equal and mutually beneficial commercial and friendly treaties with foreign countries, and unite with all nations in the world that treat us equally to fight together.

The above are the basic policies of our army. Our army will immediately implement these policies wherever it goes. These policies meet the demands of more than 90% of the people across the country.

Our army does not exclude Chiang's personnel in the same way, but adopts a policy of treating them differently. That is, the chief culprits must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded. For Chiang Kai-shek, the chief instigator of the civil war with heinous crimes, and all those who resolutely helped Chiang to do evil, harmed the people, and are recognized as war criminals by the vast majority of the people, our army will exterminate them to the ends of the earth and bring them to justice. Our army warns all Chiang's officers and soldiers, Chiang's government officials, and Chiang's party members, all those who have not yet stained the blood of innocent people, not to collude with those criminals. All those who have done bad things, quickly stop doing evil, repent and start anew, break away from Chiang Kai-shek, and will be allowed to atone for their crimes. Our army will not kill or insult Chiang's officers and soldiers who lay down their weapons. Those who are willing to stay will be accommodated, and those who are willing to leave will be sent away. Chiang's troops who revolt and join our army and those who work for our army openly or secretly will be rewarded.

In order to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and establish a democratic coalition government as soon as possible, we call on all compatriots across the country to actively cooperate with us, eliminate reactionary forces, and establish a democratic order wherever our army arrives. Where our army has not arrived, take up arms automatically, resist conscription and grain requisition, divide land and abolish debts, and develop guerrilla warfare by taking advantage of enemy gaps.

In order to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and establish a democratic coalition government as soon as possible, we call on the people in the liberated areas to thoroughly implement land reform, consolidate the democratic foundation, develop production, practice thrift, strengthen the people's armed forces, eliminate the remaining enemy strongholds, and support the front-line operations.

Commanders and fighters of our entire army, we are now shouldering the most important and glorious task in the history of our country's revolution, and we should actively work hard to complete our task. The day when our great motherland can turn from darkness to light, and the day when our dear compatriots can live like human beings and choose their own government according to their own wishes, depends on our efforts to decide. All officers and soldiers of our army must improve their military tactics, advance bravely in the war that is bound to win, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all enemies. We must improve our awareness, everyone must learn the two skills of annihilating the enemy and awakening the masses, closely unite with the masses, and quickly build the new areas into consolidated areas. We must improve our discipline, resolutely implement orders, implement policies, implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, unite the army and the people, unite the army and the government, unite our friends, unite officers and soldiers, and not allow any phenomena that violate discipline to exist. All officers and soldiers of our army must always remember that we are the great People's Liberation Army, the team led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong; as long as we always abide by Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, we will surely win.

Down with Chiang Kai-shek!

Long live New China!

　　中国人民解放军宣言
  　总部于辛亥革命三十六周年纪念日发出
    中国人民解放军在粉碎蒋介石的进攻之后，现已大举反攻。南线我军已向长江流域进击，北线我军已向中长、北宁两路进击。我军所到之处，敌人望风披靡，人民欢声雷动。整个敌我形势，和一年前比较，业已起了基本上的变化。
    本军作战目的，迭经宣告中外，是为了中国人民与中华民族的解放。而在今天，则是实现全国人民的迫切要求，打倒内战祸首蒋介石，组织民主联合政府，借以达到解放人民与民族的总目标。
    中国人民，为了自己的解放与民族的独立，和日本帝国主义英勇奋战了八年之久。日本投降后，人民渴望和平，蒋介石则破坏人民一切争取和平的努力，而以空前的内战灾难压在人民的头上。这样，就逼得全国各阶层人民除了团结起来打倒蒋介石以外，再无出路。
    蒋介石现在的内战政策，不是偶然的，这是蒋介石及其反动集团一贯反人民政策的必然结果。早在民国十六年（一九二七年），蒋介石就忘恩负义地背叛了国共两党的革命联盟，背叛了孙中山的革命的三民主义与三大政策，从此建立独裁统治，投降帝国主义，打了十年内战，造成日寇侵略。民国二十五年（一九三六年）西安事变时期，中国共产党以德报怨，协同张学良、杨虎城两将军，释放蒋介石，希望蒋介石悔过自新，共同抗日。但是蒋介石又一次忘恩负义，对于日寇则消极应战，对于人民则积极镇压，对于共产党则极端仇视。前年（一九四五年）日本投降，中国人民又一次宽恕蒋介石，要求蒋介石停止已经发动的内战，实行民主政治，团结各党派和平建国。但是毫无信义的蒋介石，在签订停战协定，通过政协决议，宣布四项诺言以后，随即将其全部推翻。人民方面，虽则再三忍让求全，但是蒋介石在美帝国主义援助之下，决心不顾国家民族的死活，向人民作空前的全面的进攻。从去年（一九四六年）一月停战协定宣布到现在，蒋介石先后动员了二百二十多个正规旅及近百万的杂色部队，向中国人民从日本帝国主义的手里用血战夺取过来的解放区，实行大举进攻，先后侵占了沈阳、抚顺、本溪、四平、长春、永吉、承德、集宁、张家口、淮阴、菏泽、临沂、延安、烟台等城市及广大的乡村。蒋军所到之处，杀人放火，奸淫掳掠，实行三光政策，和日本强盗的行为完全一样。去年十一月，蒋介石召集了伪国大、宣布了伪宪法，今年三月，蒋介石驱逐了共产党的代表。今年七月，蒋介石下了反人民的总动员令。对于全国各地反对内战、反对饥饿、反对美帝国主义侵略的正义的人民运动，对于工人、农民、学生、市民及公教人员的争生存的斗争，蒋介石的方针就是镇压、逮捕与屠杀。对于国内各少数民族，蒋介石的方针就是实施大汉族主义，摧残镇压，无所不至。在一切蒋介石统治区域，贪污遍地，特务横行，捐税繁重，物价高涨，经济破产，百业萧条，征兵征粮，怨声载道，这样就使全国绝大多数人民，处于水深火热之中。而以蒋介石为首的金融寡头，贪官污吏、土豪劣绅，则集中了巨大的财富。仅以蒋介石、宋子文、孔祥熙及陈立夫兄弟等四大家族而论，其所霸占的公私产业，价值即达一百万万美元以上。这些财产都是蒋介石利用其独裁权利横征暴敛，假公济私而来的。蒋介石为着维持独裁，进行内战，不惜出卖国家权利于外国帝国主义；勾结美国军队留驻青岛等地；从美国招致顾问人员，参加内战的指挥与军队的训练，残杀自己的同胞；内战的飞机、坦克、枪炮、弹药，则大批从美国运来；内战的经费，则大批从美国运来；而以出卖军事基地、出卖空海航权、签订奴役性商约等项比袁世凯卖国行为还要严重多倍的条件，作为酬谢美国帝国主义的礼物。总而言之，蒋介石二十年的统治，就是卖国独裁反人民的统治。到了今天，全国绝大多数人民，地无分南北，年无分老幼，都认识了蒋介石的滔天罪恶，盼望本军从速反攻，打倒蒋介石，解放全中国。
    本军是中国人民的军队，一切以中国人民的意志为意志。本军的政策，代表中国人民的迫切要求，主要的有如下各项：
    （一）联合工农兵学商各被压迫阶级、各人民团体、各民主党派、各少数民族、各地华侨及其他爱国分子，组成民族统一战线，打倒蒋介石独裁政府，成立民主联合政府。
    （二）逮捕、审判与惩办以蒋介石为首的内战罪犯。
    （三）废除蒋介石统治的独裁制度，实行人民民主制度，保障人民言论、出版、集会、结社等项自由。
    （四）废除蒋介石统治的腐败制度，肃清贪官污吏，建立廉洁政治。
    （五）没收蒋介石、宋子文、孔祥熙及陈立夫兄弟等四大家族及其他首要战犯的财产，没收官僚资本，发展民族工商业，改善职工生活，救济灾民贫民。
    （六）废除封建剥削制度，实行“耕者有其田”的制度，乡村田地，由乡村人民按照人口及田地之数量质量，平均分配使用，并归其所有。
    （七）承认中国境内各少数民族有平等自治及自由加入中国联邦的权利。
    （八）否认蒋介石独裁政府的一切卖国外交，废除一切卖国条约，否认内战期间蒋介石所借的一切外债，要求美国政府撤退其威胁中国独立的驻华军队，反对任何外国帮助蒋介石打内战和使日本侵略势力复兴，和外国订立平等互惠通商友好条约，联合世界上一切以平等待我之民族共同奋斗。
    上述各项，就是本军的基本政策。本军所到之处，立即实行这些政策。这些政策，是适合全国百分之九十以上人民的要求的。
    本军对于蒋方人员，并不一样排斥，而是采取分别对待的方针。这就是首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖。对于罪大恶极的内战祸首蒋介石及一切坚决助蒋为恶、残害人民、而为广大人民所公认的战争罪犯，本军必将剿灭他们至天涯海角，务使归案法办。本军警告一切蒋军官兵，蒋政府官员，蒋党党员，凡是尚未沾染无辜人民鲜血的人们，切勿跟那些罪犯们同流合污，凡是已经做过坏事的人们，赶快停止作恶，悔过自新，脱离蒋介石，准其将功赎罪。本军对于放下武器的蒋军官兵，一律不杀不辱，愿留者收容，愿去者遣送。对于起义加入本军的蒋军部队及公开或秘密为本军工作的人们则给予奖励。
    为了早日打倒蒋介石，建立民主联合政府，我们号召全国各界同胞，在本军到达之处，同我们积极合作，肃清反动势力，建立民主秩序。在本军未到之处，则自动拿起武器，实行抗丁抗粮，分田废债，利用敌人空隙，发展游击战争。
    为了早日打倒蒋介石，建立民主联合政府，我们号召解放区人民贯澈土地改革，巩固民主基础，发展生产，厉行节约，加强人民武装，肃清敌人残留据点，支援前线作战。
    本军全体指挥员战斗员同志们，我们现在担负了我国革命历史上最重要最光荣的任务，我们应当积极努力，完成自己的任务。我伟大祖国那一天能由黑暗转入光明，我亲爱同胞那一天能过人的生活，能按自己的愿望选择自己的政府，依靠我们的努力来决定。我全军将士必须提高军事战术，在必胜的战争中勇猛前进，坚决彻底干净全部地歼灭一切敌人。必须提高觉悟性，人人学会歼灭敌人，唤起民众两套本领，亲密团结群众，把新区迅速建设成为巩固区。必须提高纪律性，坚决执行命令，执行政策，执行三大纪律八项注意，军民一致，军政一致，我友一致，官兵一致，不允许任何破坏纪律的现象存在。我全军将士必须时刻牢记，我们是伟大的人民解放军，是伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东同志领导的队伍；只要我们时刻遵守毛泽东同志的指示，我们就一定胜利。
    打倒蒋介石！
    新中国万岁！
