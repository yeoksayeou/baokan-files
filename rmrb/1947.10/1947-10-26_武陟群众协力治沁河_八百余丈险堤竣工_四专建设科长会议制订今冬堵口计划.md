　　Wuzhi Masses Work Together to Harness the Qin River
　　Over 800 Zhang of Dangerous Dikes Completed
　　Fourth Special District Construction Section Chiefs' Meeting Formulates Winter Closure Plan
　　[This newspaper Wuzhi news] Under the constant harassment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the 60-li long Qin River embankment had nine dangerous sections, including Da Fan Village, totaling 849 zhang in length, constantly threatening the people. Our democratic government organized the masses to repair the dikes during land reform and production for self-salvation, calling on everyone to fight against the flood disaster and protect the fruits of their liberation, safeguarding the lives and property of the people of Wuzhi. Although Chiang Kai-shek's bandits repeatedly disturbed and sabotaged, coupled with continuous rainfall, it ultimately did not stop the masses' enthusiasm for dike repair. In two months (early August to the end of September), all the dangerous dikes of the Qin River were completed. A total of 58,972 labor days of civilian workers and miners were used, along with over 2.38 million jin of wood and green thatch (corn stalks, tree branches), over 1,400 large wooden stakes, 1.3434 million yuan in funds, and 174,642 jin of wheat. The following experiences were gained in the dike repair process: (1) Dike repair must be combined with central work and transformed into a mass movement. For example, the masses downstream recognized that the dike was being built for them. Meetings were held in the evening, struggles in the early morning, men repaired the dike in the morning and afternoon, and women and children delivered thatch and boiled water, so the project was completed in a few days. (2) Meticulous organization and scientific division of labor broke the masses' concept of dawdling. Each dangerous section had a river affairs bureau, and the work was distributed according to the principle of contracting. (3) Grasp current affairs education and discuss the victorious news of Liu and Deng's army crossing the river, which boosted the morale of the masses. (4) The village-based mentality must be broken. For example, the villages behind were unwilling to support the dike repair, and the villages near the embankment wanted to repair their own village's section first. After education and mobilization, it was understood that the Qin River belonged to everyone, and if one village was breached, it would be difficult for any village to survive. This is how the thinking was cleared. (5) A meritorious service campaign was launched in the dike repair, with a competition for meritorious service in each dangerous section, and continuous commendations. Under this impetus, a total of 3,400 labor days, 24,000 yuan in office expenses, and over 200 jin of wheat were saved. (Zhipeng, Runtian)
　　[Another news] The Qin River causes great harm in the Fourth District. For long-term considerations, the Fourth Special Commissioner's Office specially convened a meeting on September 1st with the construction section chiefs of the four counties of Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Qinyang, and Wenxian, as well as Shi Chengde, a meritorious official in river management in Wuzhi, and liberated peasants with experience in river management, to discuss the problem of harnessing the Qin River. Based on the dangerous conditions in each county, a plan for the counties to repair the Qin River embankment and close the breaches this winter and next spring was decided. The four counties will work together to repair 1,606 zhang, requiring over 16,000 main labor days, over 3,600 main materials of large wooden stakes, over 10,000 small wooden stakes, as well as hemp bark, reed rope, and green thatch, etc. A total of over 930,000 jin of wheat and 350,000 yuan in funds (office expenses) will be required. It is also planned that the Special Commissioner's Office will establish a River Flood Control and Water Conservancy Bureau, and the counties will establish branch bureaus to specifically lead this work. In the future, there will be dedicated personnel patrolling and inspecting the river embankments, mobilizing the masses to plant trees beside the embankments, and abolishing farming on the embankments, etc. Each village along the embankment will establish a River Defense Committee responsible for river management. At present, each county is collecting and purchasing materials and seeking out workers. As soon as the autumn harvest and wheat planting are completed, they will start work in full swing.

　　武陟群众协力治沁河
  　八百余丈险堤竣工
    四专建设科长会议制订今冬堵口计划
    【本报武陟讯】在蒋匪不断袭扰下，六十里长之沁河堤险工，计有大樊村等九处共工程八百四十九丈长经常威胁人民。我民主政府组织群众在土改与生产自救中，进行修堤，号召大家和水灾作斗争，保卫翻身果实，保卫武陟人民生命财产。虽蒋匪数次出扰破坏，加以阴雨连绵，但终未阻止群众修堤热情，在两个月中（八月初至九月底）沁河险堤全部竣工。计共用民力矿工、土工等共五万八千九百七十二工，用木料、青稍二百三十八万余斤（玉茭秆，树枝），大木桩一千四百余根，款一百三十四万三千四百元，麦子十七万四千六百四十二斤。在修堤中摸索到的几点经验：（一）修堤必须和中心工作结合，把它变为群众性的运动。如渠下群众认识堤是给自己修的，晚上开会、清早斗争，上下午男人修堤作工，妇女儿童送稍烧水，工程不日即完工。（二）组织细密分工科学，打破群众磨洋工的观念。各险工处都组织有河务局，以包工制原则把活分配出去。（三）抓紧时事教育，讨论刘邓大军过河胜利消息，提高了群众情绪。（四）必须打破村本位思想，如后边村不愿支援修堤，靠河堤村想先修本村边等想法，经教育动员，沁河是大家的，开了口那一村也难留，这样才打通思想。（五）修堤中开展了立功运动，每个险工处都有立功竞赛，不断的进行表功，这样推动下，共节省工三千四百个，办公费二万四千元，麦子二百余斤。（志鹏、润田）　　
    【又讯】沁河在四分区危害很大，为长远计，四专署特于九月一日召开了修武、武陟、沁阳、温县四县建设科长及武陟治河功臣石成德和有经验治河的翻身农民开会讨论治理沁河问题。根据各县险工情况，决定了今冬明春各县与修沁河堤堵口计划，四县共合一千六百零六丈，需用主要工一万六千余个，用主要材料大木桩三千六百余根，小木桩一万余根，及麻皮、苇绳、青稍等。共需用麦子九十三万余斤，用款（办公费）三十五万元，并计划专署设河防水利局、县设分局，专门领导这一工作。今后河堤上有专门人常巡河检查，发动群众在堤旁植树，取消堤上种地等。沿堤各村要成立河防委员会负责治河。现各县正在分头搜集购买材料，物色工人，一俟秋收种麦完成后即动工大干。（志鹏）
