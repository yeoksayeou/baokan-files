[This report from our Taiyue office, dated 30th of September] The masses in various parts of our district are competing to help families of Southern Expeditionary soldiers and families of participating militiamen and laborers with the autumn harvest and planting. In Quzhuang, Fushan, all work plans clearly stipulate: "Everything must prioritize military families and families of participants." Three days before wheat planting, over 1,100 mu of wheat fields belonging to military families, militiamen, and laborers were completely sown. Wang Jinbao, a cadre from Pangou Village, Gaoping, said: "We can't delay theirs even if it delays ours. They are shedding blood and sweat on the front lines for us, so we must also do for them." He applied ample manure to the thirty-five mu of wheat fields belonging to participating militiamen and laborers, and they have already been planted. When Jide Village in Yangcheng discovered that poor military families and families of participants were experiencing difficulties obtaining wheat seeds, the cooperative immediately lent them three shi and two dou of wheat seeds, and the land was sown. Yuan Village and other villages in Tunliu also prioritized planting wheat for military families and militiamen and laborers who went south with the army, and they applied 60 dan of manure per mu. Wang Sanlu, a labor hero from Qinyuan, specially gave military families one hundred work points to prioritize finding people to plant wheat for them. In terms of the autumn harvest, various places universally adopted large-scale labor exchange, with both men and women going to the fields together, harvesting one piece as soon as it ripened. Therefore, regardless of whether they were military families, families of participants, or the masses, they harvested as soon as the crops turned yellow. In Shangqi Village, Xia Di, Dasaka and other villages in the first district of Yuanqu, the early rice has already been harvested. Teachers in Xidui Village in the second district led students to rush to harvest over 200 mu of rice fields belonging to families of participants. From Yuebei all the way to Yuenan, along the Yellow River, the lands of military families and families of participants have all received timely harvesting and cultivation.

　　太岳各地秋收秋种
  　照顾南征人员家属
    【本报太岳三十日电】本区各地群众，争相为南征军人家属及参战民兵民夫家属秋收秋种。浮山瞿庄各种工作计划上，明确的规定：“一切先尽军属和参战家属”。在种麦时前三天，就把军属、民兵、民夫一千一百多亩麦地全部种上了。高平泮沟村干部王金保说：“误了自己的不能误了他们的，他们在前方流血流汗，是为了咱们，咱们也要为他们”。将参战民兵民夫的三十五亩麦地卧了羊，把粪上的饱饱的，并已种上。阳城吉德村在发现贫苦军属与参战人家属麦种困难时，立刻由合作社借出麦种三石二斗，把地种上了。屯留原村等村亦先给军属与随军南征的民兵民夫种麦，并且每亩要上粪六十担。沁源劳动英雄王三炉，特别优待军属工票一百分，以此先找人种麦。在收秋方面各地普遍采用了男女齐上地的大变工，黄一块收一块，所以不分军属参战人家属群众，黄了就收。垣曲一区上七村硖敌、大坂等村，早谷已收起，二区×堆村教员带领学生，抢先把参战家属二百多亩谷地收起了，从岳北一直到岳南，黄河边上，军属与参战人家属的地，都得到及时的收割与耕种。
