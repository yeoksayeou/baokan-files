　　The troops were all advancing, but the special-class combat hero Li Mingxi's platoon hadn't received a combat mission yet. He watched other platoons bring back batches of prisoners and hand over bundles of guns to the superiors. He anxiously requested a mission from his superiors, but it was never granted. He was really anxious and was about to leave with the Seventh Squad. The company commander, seeing the burst of courage emanating from them, couldn't stop them no matter what. He could only urge them:
　　"Be sure to maintain good communication!"
　　Li Mingxi was so happy to hear the company commander's response that he jumped up and down. As he walked, he told everyone:
　　"Other platoons have achieved victories, we must also fight well!"
　　The warriors behind him replied in unison:
　　"That's right, how can we be worthy of others if we don't show our skills!"
　　They searched along the street towards the West Gate and discovered groups of enemies huddled in the gatehouse trenches and on top of the West Gate, in a state of panic. It was clear that they were remnants trying to escape. Li Mingxi immediately divided the entire squad into three groups and charged towards the enemy. But as they charged in, they were surrounded by the enemy. Li Mingxi became anxious and shouted loudly: "Comrades, charge out!" At his command, a burst of hand grenades was thrown, and the seven of them fought their way out.

　　Then, Comrade Mingxi organized a second charge. He kept the three groups closer together to avoid being surrounded individually and continued to encourage everyone, saying: "These are scattered enemies, we must wipe them out!"
　　Seeing his firm, calm, and courageous attitude, the soldiers' courage doubled, and they fearlessly pounced on the enemy. However, due to the disparity in numbers, the enemy repelled three charges.
　　At this time, Li Mingxi and the Seventh Squad did not flinch. They then launched a fourth charge. This time, the enemy was in chaos, attempting to use their advantage to encircle our soldiers for bayonet combat. Only the sound of bayonets clashing could be heard, no gunfire. At this moment, Li Mingxi was grappling with an enemy for his gun when suddenly, an enemy came from behind and grabbed him around the waist, throwing him to the ground. Then, two more enemies came over, their guns pointed at Mingxi's head, about to end his life. Comrade Mingxi, in his wisdom, rolled around, dodging two enemy bullets. As the enemy was pushing in the third bullet, Mingxi grabbed the enemy's gun barrel, using the enemy's force to stand up, and knocked the enemy into the trench with the gunstock. The other two enemies turned and ran for their lives, but he grabbed one of them. He shouted again: "Comrades, charge out! We will fight them to the end even if we die!" The soldiers, seeing how Vice Platoon Leader had escaped from such a dangerous situation, were even more courageous.

　　During their fifth charge, the chaotic enemy was shocked, their courage broken, and they scattered. They took the opportunity to pursue, capturing prisoners and seizing weapons. After the battle, they escorted seventy-four prisoners and carried sixty-one rifles and one machine gun, happily handing them over to their superiors as the first gift after crossing the Yellow River.

  　解放新安中的战斗故事

    部队都向前发展了，但特等战斗英雄李明喜排，还没有接到战斗任务，他眼看见其他排成批的把俘虏押送回来，一捆捆的将枪交了上级，焦急的向上级要求任务，总未得到允许，他实在急了，带起七班就要走，连长看着他们一股勇气奔放出来，无论如何再也阻挡不住了，只好叮咛他们说：
    “要好好连系呀！”
    李明喜听到连长这个答复，高兴的直跳起来，一面走着，一面给大家说：
    “其他排都得到了胜利，我们也要好好的打呀！”
    跟在他后面的勇士们，同声回答：
    “对，不露一手，怎能对得起人呢！”
    他们顺大街一直向西门搜索，发现了门洞交通壕里、西门上拥着一群群的敌人，慌乱成一团，不用问便知是企图逃跑的残兵，李明喜马上把全班分成三个组，一齐向敌人冲去，但他们冲进去，却被敌人包围过来了，李明喜气急了，大声呼喊：“同志们：冲出去呀！”一声令下，接着便扔了一阵手榴弹，他们七个人杀开一条血路冲出来了。
    接着明喜同志又组织了第二次冲锋，他将三个组靠的近些以免各个为敌包围，并继续鼓励大家说：“这是散乱了的敌人，我们一定要消灭掉他！”
    战士们看到他那坚定沉着勇敢的态度，也就勇气倍增，一个个毫无惧色的向敌人扑去，但终因众寡悬殊，三次冲锋又被敌人击退。
    这个时候，李明喜和第七班毫不畏缩，接着又进行第四次冲锋，这一次敌人搅成一团，企图仗其优势将我们的战士团团包围起来，进行白刃格斗，只听刺刀响，不闻枪弹声，这时李明喜正拿着手枪和对面一个敌人夺枪，猛不防，从背后过来一个敌人拦腰一抱，将他摔倒在地，随即又过来了两个敌人，枪口对准明喜的头部，正要结束他的性命，明喜同志急中生智，便乱滚起来，躲过了敌人两发枪弹，敌人正在推第三发子弹的当儿，明喜一把抓住了敌人的枪口，借敌之力站了起来，一枪杆把敌人打倒交通壕内，其余的两个敌人正没命的回头就跑，又被他抓住了一个，他又大喊：“同志们：冲出去呀！死也要和他们干到底呀！”战士们眼看副排长刚才那样危险的情况，尚且脱险，更是勇气万分。
    他们第五次冲锋时，混乱的敌人被震慑了，吓破了胆，一哄而散，他们趁势追赶，抓俘虏缴枪支，战斗结束后，他们押着七十四个俘虏，扛了六十一条步枪，一挺机枪，笑嘻嘻的交了上级，作为打过黄河的第一个献礼。
