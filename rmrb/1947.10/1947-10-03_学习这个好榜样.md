　　Learn From This Good Example
    With the continuous stream of good news from the great counter-offensive, telecommunications workers in the border region are making every effort to boost production to support our army's operations on the southern front. Personnel at the telecommunications assembly plant are persisting in working 13 hours a day, some even working around the clock without rest. As a result of the entire factory's conscious effort to process and produce, the production volume for the first three months has already exceeded the target by 100%; the subsequent two months exceeded the first three months by another double. When the front line requested a certain military weapon device, they used all their strength to research it and quickly provided a solution; when the front line requested telecommunications cadres and personnel, the telecommunications school intensified its crash training; when the front line requested the supply of current affairs news, Handan Radio Station set up a special time every day to broadcast to the front line... These comrades are familiar with science and proficient in technology. They have used all their strength to support the front line and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek. This spirit is worthy of respect from the military and civilians of the whole country!
    The great counter-offensive is developing victoriously. Every agency, every department, every mine, every factory in our rear, as well as every worker, should not be left behind, and should learn from the comrades in the telecommunications department, strive to use all our strength in this sacred War of Liberation, go all out to help the front line, and bravely advance to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible!

　　学习这个好榜样
    大反攻的捷报不断传来，边区电信工作者正以全力突击生产，支援南线我军的作战。电信装配工厂人员，每天坚持工作十三小时，有的坚持到一天一夜，还不休息。全厂自觉加工生产的结果，前三月生产额，即已超过任务百分之百；后二月又超过前三月的一倍。前方要求某种军事武器的装置，他们用尽全力研究，迅速给予解决；前方要求电信干部人员，电信学校又加紧突击训练；前方要求时事新闻的供给，邯郸广播电台每天就设专门时间向前方播送……。这些同志熟习科学，精通技术，他们就拿出自己所有的全部力量来支援前线，打倒蒋介石，这种精神是值得全国军民尊敬的！
    大反攻的进军，正在胜利的发展，我们后方的每一机关，每一部门，每一矿山，每一工厂，以及每一个工作人员，不甘该落后，应向电信部门的同志们学习，在这神圣的解放战争中，争取自己一切力量来，全力去援助前线，为早日打倒蒋介石而奋勇前进！
