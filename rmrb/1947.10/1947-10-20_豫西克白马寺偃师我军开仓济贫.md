　　Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 18th: Delayed news: A unit of the Eastern Front Guerrilla Corps, in coordination with the main force, captured the Chiang bandit strongholds of Baimasi, Pingle, and Xiangquan villages, 20 li northeast of Luoyang, on the night of the 10th, creating a brilliant record of 1 to 120. When this unit arrived after a rapid march, the Chiang stubborn township government and the National Soldiers were still in a state of oblivious slumber, and were captured alive by us. A total of more than 120 enemies were captured, and more than 100 rifles, two grenade launchers, and some ammunition were seized. We only suffered one injury.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei, 18th: After our liberation of Yanshi, we implemented the policy of opening granaries to relieve the poor. In the battle to liberate Yanshi on the 11th, we seized more than 300,000 jin of wheat and 27,000 jin of cotton from the Chiang bandit warehouses. On the 12th, the People's Liberation Army sent people to the surrounding villages to announce the opening of the granaries and the distribution of grain. On that day, more than 20,000 people from villages within 20 li of the city and urban residents went to collect grain, rejoicing wildly, and the roads were blocked. Our army then distributed all the seized wheat to the masses.

　　豫西克白马寺偃师我军开仓济贫
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十八日电】迟到消息：东线游击兵团一部于十日夜配合大军袭占洛阳以东东北二十里之蒋匪据点白马寺、平乐、相泉村镇，创造一比一百二十之光辉战绩。该部急行军到达时，蒋顽乡公所、国民兵等尚在梦乡昏迷中，当被我活捉，计俘敌一百二十余名，缴步枪百余支，掷弹筒两个，弹药等一部，我仅伤一名。
    【新华社豫陕鄂十八日电】我解放偃师后，实行开仓济贫。十一日我解放偃师之战中，缴获蒋匪仓库中小麦三十余万斤，棉花二万七千斤，十二日解放军乃派人往周围各村打锣宣布开仓散粮。是日离城二十里内各村及城关群众前去领粮者达两万余人，欢欣若狂，途为之塞，我军乃将所缴获小麦全部分给群众。
