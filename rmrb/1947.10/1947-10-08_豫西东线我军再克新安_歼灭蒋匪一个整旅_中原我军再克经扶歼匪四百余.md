Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 6th—On the dawn of the 2nd, our army recaptured Xin'an County, 65 li west of Luoyang, capturing over 20 guns from the enemy and seizing 3 vehicles. The city was the first county seat liberated by our southward-crossing army on August 25th, and was encroached upon by Wu Tinglin, commander of the KMT's 15th Division, leading the 64th Brigade and the 51st Regiment of the 17th Brigade, on September 18th.

Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 6th—On the eastern front, our army annihilated the 64th Brigade of the KMT's reorganized 15th Division in the Tiemen area of Xin'an on the 2nd, killing or wounding over 300 enemies and capturing over 1,700, including Deputy Brigade Commander Wang Wencai. Two mountain guns, seven mortars, sixteen heavy machine guns, and three vehicles were seized. Detailed battle results are still being verified. In late August, this enemy force suffered a heavy blow from our army in Hengshui Town, northwest of Luoyang. On September 9th, Wu Tinglin, commander of the 15th Division, personally led this brigade and the 51st Regiment of the 17th Brigade of the 38th Division to invade Xin'an. They were intercepted by our main force in the Zhengcun area northeast of the city, and we annihilated their 191st Regiment in one fell swoop, and the 190th Regiment was also severely damaged. The remnants retreated to Luoyang for reorganization, and on the 18th, they invaded Xin'an County, but were constantly fearful and panicked. On the night of the 30th, Wu Tinglin again personally led the 64th Brigade and others to harass Tiemen Town, 30 li west of the city. The next morning, they discovered that they were surrounded by our army. At midnight on the same day, they hurriedly abandoned heavy artillery, vehicles, etc., and broke through to the south. On the dawn of the 2nd, we blocked the 64th Brigade back to the Xingaocun and Miaotou area, and annihilated them in one fell swoop. Wu Tinglin only led a few followers to escape south. Liu Xianjie, commander of the 64th Brigade, escaped after being captured. The KMT's 15th Division has two brigades under its command. The 135th Brigade has already been annihilated twice by us in the Qinghuabian and Shanxian battles in northern Shaanxi and western Henan. Now the remnants of its 64th Brigade have also been annihilated. By this point, the enemy's 15th Division has been completely wiped out.

Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 6th—A part of our army that went south from Lushi has been quite successful in clearing out local bandits and scattered remnants in recent days. On the 2nd, our army defeated a KMT miscellaneous bandit squadron in Wulichuan (100 li south of Lushi), capturing ten people and seizing twelve rifles. Another part of our army is clearing out remnants in the areas of Zhuyangguan and Shihuaishu.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 6th—A certain unit of our army re-entered Jingfu County on the afternoon of the 1st, killing or wounding over 100, including the puppet security chief Huang Hui and the KMT county chief, capturing over 300 people, and seizing over 200 rifles and hundreds of artillery shells. Jingfu was first liberated by us on August 28th, and after changing hands twice, it has now been recovered by us.

　　豫西东线我军再克新安
  　歼灭蒋匪一个整旅
  　中原我军再克经扶歼匪四百余
    【新华社豫西前线六日电】二日拂晓我军再克洛阳西六十五里之新安县城，俘敌人枪各二十余，缴汽车三辆，残敌向东南逃窜。该城系于八月二十五日经我南渡大军解放之第一座县城，九月十八日被蒋匪十五师师长武庭麟率六十四旅及十七旅之五十一团所侵陷。
    【新华社豫西前线六日电】东线我军二日于新安属铁门地区歼灭蒋军整编十五师之六十四旅，毙伤三百余名，生俘副旅长王文才以下一千七百余名，缴获山炮二门，迫击炮七门，重机枪十六挺，汽车三辆，详细战果尚在清查中。八月下旬该敌曾于洛阳西北横水镇遭我军痛击；九月九日十五师师长武庭麟亲率该旅及三十八师十七旅五十一团进犯新安，在城东北正村地区为我大军堵击，一举歼灭其一九一团，一九○团亦受重创。残敌溃退洛阳整补，十八日侵陷新安县城。但终日战战兢兢，惊惶不已。三十日夜武庭麟复亲率六十四旅等窜扰城西三十里铁门镇，次晨发觉已陷我军重围，当日午夜仓惶丢掉重炮汽车等向南突围，二日拂晓我将六十四旅堵回新高村、庙头一带，而一举围歼之。武庭麟仅率少数随从向南逃去，六十四旅旅长刘献捷被俘后乘隙脱逃。按蒋军十五师共辖两个旅，其一三五旅已于陕北青化砭及豫西陕县战斗中两次被我歼灭，其六十四旅残部今又被歼，至此敌十五师已全师覆灭。
    【新华社豫西前线六日电】卢氏南下我军一部，连日清剿土顽散匪，甚为得手。二日我军在五里川（卢氏南百里）击溃蒋杂顽一个中队，俘十人，缴步枪十二支。另部我军则在朱阳关及石槐树一带清剿残敌。
    【新华社中原前线六日电】我军某部于一日下午再度进驻经扶县城，毙伤伪保安团长黄回及蒋记县长以下百余名，生俘三百余人，缴获步枪二百余支，炮弹数百发。经扶曾于八月二十八日为我首次解放，后经两度易手，此次又为我收复。
