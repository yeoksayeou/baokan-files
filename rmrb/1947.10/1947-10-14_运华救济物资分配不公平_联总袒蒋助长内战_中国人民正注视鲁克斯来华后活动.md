Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: UNRRA Director Rooks, who was confirmed last month to come to China for "inspection," arrived in Shanghai on the 7th of this month via Tokyo. According to various sources, Rooks will make a one-month "trip" in China to conduct a "general inspection" of UNRRA's work in China. Rooks will discuss with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities the "unfinished business" of the UNRRA relief plan for China, scheduled to end at the end of this year, as well as the "trusteeship" issue after UNRRA's end, and the suggestions for long-term plans that UNRRA has already begun. It is said that the issue of relief to the Liberated Areas "is also one of the topics of discussion." The Central News Agency said that Rooks will decide during this "inspection" "whether UNRRA in China should adhere to its policy of non-political discrimination in its distribution."

Since UNRRA decided to stop relief to the Liberated Areas, UNRRA has completely placed itself in a position of unilaterally aiding Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war, and in many actions has openly shown an attitude of supporting and shielding Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding its "relief" policy and "neutral" position. When UNRRA suddenly made the "decision" to stop relief to the Liberated Areas, even most of the staff of the UNRRA China office felt that this "decision" was unreasonable and made a serious protest to the UNRRA Central Committee in Washington, demanding that "UNRRA should simultaneously stop relief to the Kuomintang to change the unfair situation created by UNRRA's decision." UNRRA not only remained unmoved but also publicly supported the Kuomintang's tone and denounced "stopping relief to the Kuomintang" as "unwise" and "inappropriate." At the same time as stopping relief to the Liberated Areas, UNRRA proposed making Yantai port a demilitarized city as a condition for continuing to transport relief supplies. But as everyone knows, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities were then arranging an attack on Yantai. At the end of August, Chiang Kai-shek again put forward a "provisional method for relief to the Communist areas (i.e., the Liberated Areas)," attempting to use the opportunity of relief supplies being transported into the Liberated Areas through Yantai port to infiltrate its military forces into the Liberated Areas, in order to cooperate with the attack on Yantai and the Jiaodong Peninsula. The "supervision" of the distribution and transportation of these materials would be participated in by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Ministry of National Defense. The military purpose of this unreasonable regulation was very obvious. However, according to the Central News Agency at the time, UNRRA actually gave it "agreement in principle." Cleveland, the director of the UNRRA China office, went to Ping with the illusion of obtaining the consent of the Liberated Areas on this "method." When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities actively arranged the attack on Yantai, all UNRRA personnel in Yantai were evacuated in order to let the Chiang Kai-shek bandits launch the attack freely. But after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits invaded Yantai and decided to give Yantai to their American masters as an invasion base in China, UNRRA personnel immediately returned to Yantai and announced the resumption of "relief" to Yantai. All this proves that UNRRA is not only in a position of directly aiding Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war and slaughtering the Chinese people, but also has openly appeared on the front line of the civil war. UNRRA attributed the cessation of relief to the Liberated Areas to the Kuomintang's "obstruction," but in fact, UNRRA had the power to stop this "obstruction" by the Kuomintang, but UNRRA was unwilling to do so. UNRRA was even unwilling to condemn this destructive behavior by the Kuomintang. According to a message from the Central News Agency in Washington on September 15, "UNRRA's attitude is that the failure of the Chinese government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities) and the Communist Party to reach an agreement on transporting supplies to the Communist areas should not be blamed on the National Government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities)." UNRRA's attitude of shielding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities from facts known to the world is nakedly revealed.

UNRRA has been carrying out relief in China for more than two years, but it has never truly implemented its promise of "fair and reasonable distribution of relief supplies." As of the end of July this year, of the 2,151,376 tons of relief supplies transported to China by UNRRA, the Liberated Areas, which suffered the most from the Japanese invaders' war of aggression against China and whose disaster victims accounted for more than six-tenths of the country's total, received only 1.53 percent. When UNRRA suddenly stopped relief to the Liberated Areas at the end of July, even the 50,000 tons of supplies originally planned to be shipped to the Liberated Areas were stopped. All of the more than 200,000 tons of supplies that UNRRA continued to ship to China in August and September were handed over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities. This is the true situation of UNRRA's "relief" in China for more than two years. In short, UNRRA has a bad reputation, and the indignant Chinese people are watching the activities of Rooks after his arrival in China. This will mark whether UNRRA will become aware of something under the condemnation of the Chinese people, or continue to be an accomplice of Chiang Kai-shek to the end.

### 运华救济物资分配不公平　联总袒蒋助长内战  中国人民正注视鲁克斯来华后活动

　　运华救济物资分配不公平
  　联总袒蒋助长内战
    中国人民正注视鲁克斯来华后活动
    【新华社陕北十二日电】上月中确定来华“视察”之联总署长鲁克斯，已于本月七日经东京飞抵上海。据各方披露，鲁氏在华将作一月“旅行”，以便对联总在华工作“作一普遍之视察”。鲁氏将与蒋匪当局商讨定于今年年底结束之联总对华救济计划“未了业务”，以及联总结束后“托管”问题、联总已着手进行的长期计划之建议问题。据称，关于对解放区救济问题“亦为讨论的主题之一”。中央社说，鲁氏将在此次“视察”中决定“在中国方面联总是否应坚持其分配时在政治上毫无歧视之政策。”
    按自联总决定停止对解放区救济以来，联总已使自己完全处于片面援蒋内战之地位，且在许多行动中公开出以支持和袒护蒋介石的态度，置其“救济”方针与“中立”立场于丝毫不顾。当联总突然作出停止对解放区救济“决定”，甚至连联总驻华办事处大多数职员亦感觉此一“决定”之不合理，向华盛顿联总中央委员会提出严正抗议，要求“联总应同时停止对国民党救济、以改变联总决定所造成之不公平情势”时，联总不但不为所动，反以公开支持国民党口吻将“停止对国民党救济”斥为“不智”“不当”。与停止对解放区救济同时，联总曾提出使烟台港口成为不设防城市，以作继续运送救济物资之条件。但众所周知，蒋匪当局当时正布置对烟台之进攻。八月底，蒋介石复提出一“对共区（即解放区）救济暂行办法”，企图借救济物资经由烟台港口运入解放区机会，将其军事力量渗入解放区，以达配合进攻烟台及胶东半岛之目的。并由蒋匪国防部参与对该项物资分配、运送之“监督”。此项无理规定之军事目的甚属明显。然据当时中央社消息，联总却竟予以“原则同意”。联总驻华办事处处长克利夫兰于八月底赴平时，并曾妄想征得解放区方面对此项“办法”之同意。当蒋匪当局积极布置对烟台之进攻时，烟台联总人员即全部撤退，以便蒋匪放手进攻。但当蒋匪侵进烟台后，与蒋匪决定将烟台送给其美国主子做侵华基地同时，联总人员又立即重返烟台，并宣布恢复对烟台之“救济”。凡此皆证明，联总不仅已处于直接援蒋内战屠杀中国人民之地位，而且已公然出现于内战前线。联总曾将停止对解放区救济一举归因于国民党之“阻挠”，但事实上，联总完全有力量停止国民党此种“阻挠”，联总却不愿意这样作。联总甚至不愿对国民党此种破坏行为加以斥责，据中央社华盛顿九月十五日消息即说：“联总方面之态度，认为中国政府（指蒋匪当局）与共产党间关于运输物资至共产党区未能获得协议，不应归罪于国民政府（指蒋匪当局）。”联总不愿举世周知的事实袒护蒋匪当局的态度赤裸裸表现出来。
    联总在华进行救济已经两年多，但却从来没有真正实行“公平合理分配救济物资”的诺言。截至今年七月底止，联总运输来华之二百一十五万一千三百七十六吨救济物资，遭受日寇侵华战争损失最重、灾民占全国十分之六以上的解放区，所得却仅占百分之一点五三。七月底联总突然停止对解放区救济时，连原拟决定运往解放区之五万吨物资亦被停运。八、九两月联总继续运华之二十余万吨物资中则全部交给蒋匪当局。此即两年多来联总在华实行“救济”之真实情形。总之联总已声名狼藉，愤慨的中国人民正注视鲁克斯来华后的活动，这将标志联总在中国人民斥责下是否有所觉悟，或仍作蒋介石帮凶到底。
