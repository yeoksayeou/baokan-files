　　Mass Inspection, Public Exposure, and Severe Criticism of "Absentee Landlords"
　　The News of "Civil Affairs Section Chief Shi Zongle Supports Thoroughly Fighting His Own Family"
　　Should Not Be Praised in the Newspaper

Comrade Editor:
    Yesterday, I saw a piece of news on page two of the People's Daily (September 23rd issue): "Civil Affairs Section Chief Shi Zongle Supports Thoroughly Fighting His Own Family." I think this news is worth studying.
    The news said that when the struggle against his elder brother was brewing, he returned home. After he expressed his attitude and mobilized his brother, mother, and wife to hand over ninety taels of silver, twenty-three silver dollars, the masses, considering his contributions to the revolution, left his family twenty-five mu of land and six rooms, downgrading them to lower-middle peasants in the village. The masses were touched and said that he was a cadre who served the people. The questionable points are: First, the wealth his family handed over was "mobilized" by him. This "mobilization" is problematic. According to general circumstances, landlords would rather die than give up their wealth and would not be willing to hand over all their property, even if they were beaten to death. His "mobilization" could not be thorough, implicitly sheltering the landlord and confusing the masses about the activeness of the struggle against his family. Second, "the masses considered his contributions to the revolution." This is a meritorious ideology. Even if he has made contributions, his family should not be allowed to escape the direct struggle of the masses. It should be handled entirely by the masses. It is not good for him to be in the middle, as it achieves the actual effect of maintaining the interests of the landlord. Third, "the family has no labor force." What is his brother, Shi Zonghong? Why is he not considered a labor force? Fourth, "leaving twenty-five mu of land and six rooms," can this be considered a thorough struggle? Maybe his family still has a lot of hidden property that has not been taken out, far from being thorough! Fifth, the masses' emotions and the evil deeds of his family are not visible from this news. The masses were actually very satisfied and said that he was Chairman Mao's cadre. This is either untrue news or the masses have not been thoroughly awakened.
    If this kind of news is used as guidance, it will confuse both the masses and the cadres. It confuses the masses by implying that if a landlord's family has someone working in the revolution, they should be taken care of and treated specially. It confuses the cadres by implying that cadres from landlord backgrounds, as long as they have an enlightened attitude and can "mobilize" their family to hand over things, can reduce the struggle against their family and be taken care of by the masses. This kind of unclear stance that mixes landlords and revolution should not be praised in the newspaper.
    I hope you can inquire about the actual situation. (Ding Ding)

    What is the Composition of the Director of the Dongguan Farmers' Association in Weixian County?
Comrade Editor:
    After reading page two of the People's Daily on the 9th, I have two small opinions:
    First, the article "The Whole Village of Dongguan Forms Labor Exchange Teams" does not mention which county it is in. Some local news only has the county name, without the district (i.e., administrative region) name, and some counties are new county names, making it difficult for people to understand.
    Second, the article "Director of the Dongguan Farmers' Association in Weixian County..." does not state the composition of the director himself (only saying he is very poor) or why he sheltered the landlord. There are two possible evaluations of this news: (1) If the director of the Farmers' Association is from the basic masses, deceived and tricked by the landlord, and his position is unstable for a while, then this handling method needs to be reconsidered. (2) If the director of the Farmers' Association is an alien element mixed into the Farmers' Association, then further tracking and resolution should be carried out. In other words, if this news is the first situation, then it deviates from the spirit advocated by the news "Carry out Self-Reporting and Solidarity Movement," which seems to be an ideological oversight on the part of the editor. (He Jing)

    Not Three Hundred and Twenty-Odd Loads
Comrade Editor:
    I saw on page two of the People's Daily on September 10th the news about the Qiushuyuan Branch in the Third District of Licheng promoting and leading the expansion of wheat fields. Rongjun Duan Wenyan swept three hundred and twenty-odd loads of pigeon manure. According to the original manuscript, it was twenty-odd loads. (It was an editing error). Recently, the newspaper has been publishing news about various places actively reviewing "absentee landlord" ideology, so I keep a copy of all my manuscripts. Therefore, as soon as I saw this news, I compared it with my copy, and the amount of pigeon manure was indeed different. To be responsible to the Party newspaper, I immediately wrote this letter to explain and hope for a correction. (Wang Fangqin)

    How is the Finance of Wuan Village Being Sorted Out?
Comrade Editor:
    Currently, before the autumn harvest in Wuan, each district is rectifying mutual aid and finance. However, two-thirds of the villages where village finance is oriented towards production are using the fruits of mass struggle, without truly sorting it out, which is inconsistent with the spirit of turning dead things into living money. Transforming this point is very important, otherwise it will hinder the progress of this work. In Huanglishan Village, thirty million yuan of the fruits of struggle were extracted and invested in the cooperative as a village financial production fund, while the dead things in the village were not sorted out at all. The Third District financial and grain assistant said that in Wei District, seven or eight out of ten villages oriented towards production are using the fruits of struggle. Perhaps there are many such situations in other new districts. (Xiang Ming)

(Editor's Note: The People's Daily published a Taixing dispatch on page two of this newspaper on the first of this month, "Half of the Villages in Wuan are Self-Sufficient in Production," which is inconsistent with the spirit pointed out by Comrade Xiang Ming. The former praised it, while the latter pointed out its bias. What is the truth? We hope that all parties will provide explanations.)

### 群众检查公开揭露严厉批判“客里空”

　　群众检查公开揭露严厉批判“客里空”
  　“民运科长师宗乐撑腰斗透自己家”的新闻
  　不该在报上表扬编辑同志：
    昨天在人民日报二版上（九月二十三日报）看到一条消息：“民运科长师宗乐撑腰斗透自己家”，我觉得这条消息值得研究。
    消息上说正酝酿斗争他哥时，他回了家，经他表明态度，动员他哥、母亲、妻子交出九十两元宝，二十三元现洋，群众念他革命有功，但他全家留下二十五亩地，六间房，降成该村的下中农。群众感动地说，他是为群众服务的干部。值得怀疑的问题是：一、他家拿出的财物是他“动员”的，这“动员”就有问题，根据一般情形，地主舍命不舍财，打死都不肯把财物拿尽，他“动员”绝不可能彻底，无形中庇护了地主，迷惑群众对他家斗争的积极性。二、“群众念其革命有功”，这是居功思想，他有功，也不该使他家逃避群众的直接斗争，应完全由群众处理，他夹在当中就不好，达到了维护地主利益的实际效果。三、“家庭无劳力”，他哥师宗鸿是什么？为啥不算劳力？四、“留了二十五亩地，六间房”，这能算斗透吗？说不定他家还有很多内藏没拿出来，离透远着哩！五、当时群众情绪和他家罪恶情况，从这条消息上看不出来，群众居然很满意，说他是毛主席的干部，这不是消息不真实就是群众还没彻底觉悟。
    这类消息如做为指导，既迷惑群众又迷惑干部。迷惑群众的是：地主家有人在外做革命工作，就该受照顾，可以特殊。迷惑干部的是：地主出身的干部，只要自己态度开明，能“动员”家里人拿出东西，就可以使家庭减轻被斗，可以受到群众照顾。这样把地主和革命混成一团的立场不明的事情，不该在报上表扬。
    希望你们能询问一下实际情况。（丁丁）
    威县东关农会主任　是什么成份？编辑同志：
    看了九日人民日报二版，有两点小意见：
    一、“东关全村变工”条找不见是那一县的。地方新闻有些只有县名，无区（即行署区）名，又个别县是新县名，不易使人弄清楚。
    二、“威县东关农会主任……”条，没有说明农会主任本人是什么成份（只说很穷），为什么包庇地主。对这件新闻的估价便会有两种可能：（一）农会主任如是基本群众，被地主欺骗上当，自己一时立场不稳，那么这种处理方法尚有重新考虑的必要。（二）农会主任如是异己分子混入农会，就应更进一步追踪解决。也就是说：这条新闻如果是第一种情况，就和“开展自报团结运动”那条新闻所提倡的精神有了出入，这在编者说来，似乎是一种思想上的忽略。（何静）
    不是三百二十多担编辑同志：
    看到人民日报九月十号第二版黎城三区秋树垣支部推动领导扩大麦田消息，荣军段文彦扫鸽肥三百二十多担，按原稿系二十多担。（是编辑删改错误）因近来报上登载各地正积极检讨“客里空”思想，所以我写稿都留有存根，因此我一见这个消息就与我的存根对了一下，扫鸽肥数目确实差了。为对党报负责，所以我马上写此一信说明，希望更正。（王芳芹）
    武安村财政是怎样整理的？编辑同志：
    现武安在秋收前，各区都在整顿互助整顿财政，但村财政过去走向生产的村三分之二，是用的群众斗争果实，没有真正整理，与死东西变活钱的精神不合，转变这一点很重要，不然他阻碍着这一工作的进行。黄粟山村过去把斗争果实抽出三十万元投入合作社，作为村财政生产基金，而村上的死东西根本没整。三区财粮助理员谈，如魏区走向生产的村十分之七、八都是用的斗争果实，其他新区或许这种情形不少。（向明）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （编者按：本月一日本报二版刊载太行电“武安半数村庄生产自给”新闻，与向明同志所指出的精神不符。前者予以表扬，后者指出偏向，真象如何，希各方加以说明。）
