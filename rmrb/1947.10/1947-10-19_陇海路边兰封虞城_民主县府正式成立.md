[Reported from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 17th] Our armed forces of the Third and Fifth Sub-districts of Henan Province, in coordination with the main forces, are actively attacking the marginal areas to expand the liberated areas. Democratic governments of Lanfeng and Yucheng counties have been newly established along the Longhai Railway. On September 24th, Lanfeng County held a mass meeting in ××Zhai, and the democratic county government was officially established. At the meeting, six major proposals for governance were announced: (1) Resolutely implement land reform to realize "land to the tiller"; (2) No past wrongdoings will be investigated after the surrender of puppet and diehard personnel; (3) Puppet Bao and Jia heads can atone for their crimes by serving the people; (4) Confiscate all properties of fleeing landlords and hand them over to the masses for disposal; (5) Burden policy: those with more than three mu per person are exempt from one mu, and those with less than three mu are exempt from one and a half mu; (6) Schools will continue to operate. In addition, the style of the democratic government was explained. The masses were very excited after the meeting and reflected, "This government should have been established long ago."

The democratic county government of Yucheng County has also been officially established. The masses in the county have just been liberated, and under the influence of our distribution of wealth, poor peasants have realized that the Communist Party is their savior.

　　陇海路边兰封虞城
  　民主县府正式成立
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】我黄河南三、五分区武装配合主力作战，积极向边缘区进攻，扩大解放区。在陇海路边沿新建立了兰封、虞城两县民主政府。兰封县于九月二十四日在××砦举行群众大会，民主县政府正式建立，并在会上宣布施政的六大主张：（一）坚决实行土地改革，实现耕者有其田；（二）伪顽人员反正后，不究既往；（三）伪保甲长可带罪立功，为人民办事；（四）没收逃亡地主一切财产，交群众处理；（五）负担政策：每人合三亩以上者免一亩，三亩以下者免一亩半；（六）学校继续开办。此外并讲解了民主政府的作风等，会后群众甚为兴奋，纷纷反映：“这个政府早该成立了。”
    虞城县民主县政府亦正式建立，该县群众初获解放，在我们分浮财的影响下，穷苦农民认清了共产党才是他们的救命恩人。
