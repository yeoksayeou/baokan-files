Taiyue Taihang Border Region Armed Forces
　　Take the Initiative to Protect the Autumn Harvest
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 18th dispatch] The counties along the northern border of Taiyue, with one hand holding a gun and the other reaping the autumn harvest, the armed forces protecting the front adopted the tactic of taking the initiative. The famous Zhang Ximan fighting team in Jiexiu, active in the heart of the Yan bandit territory, following the Zhaojiaying battle last month where they annihilated ten Yan bandits, encountered Yan bandits invading from Yuancun Fort and Zhanglan Station on the 2nd. The Zhang Ximan fighting team calmly responded, and after ten minutes of fierce fighting, killed and wounded four Yan bandits. Lingshi also adopted this tactic. After gathering intelligence and understanding the situation, they concentrated superior forces to conduct ambushes or "heart-stabbing" tactics to capture and eliminate the enemy. At the same time, to prevent sudden encirclement, they also adopted methods such as field joint defense outposts. Therefore, the rear areas were able to organize labor to carry out the autumn harvest. In particular, in Guozhuang, Huo County, because most of the men went to the front to serve as guards or support the front lines, women and children were organized. A relatively large wage system was established. Picking one jin of cotton earned a wage of two liang of cotton, harvesting one mu of corn earned a wage of five sheng, and husking one shi of corn earned a wage of one dou. Under this encouragement, men, women, and children all went to the fields, ensuring that each ripe piece was harvested quickly, fought quickly and hidden quickly.
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Boai Border Region Joint Defense Headquarters convened a mobilization meeting on September 28th, gathering over six hundred village cadres, model heroes, and activists from twenty villages in the three front districts. They exposed and shattered the ideas of compromise or underestimation of the enemy and paralysis. Under the slogan of "Never support the enemy, prevent drought every year, guard against thieves every night, not let the enemy grab a grain of food, and not leave an acre of bare land," the villages launched a heated competition to protect the grain and seize the planting season. The rotational combat teams of the troops, combined with the local militia, were active day and night in the Six Families, Beizhu Village, and Wangfulin, one or two li away from the enemy strongholds, reaping during the day and laying mines at night, with great enthusiasm. Under armed protection, all the labor and livestock in the border villages have been organized. Hegui Village, taking the administrative village as a unit, organized a grain protection and seizure committee, under which were three sections: armed protection, labor and livestock organization, and propaganda mobilization. They unified planning, directing the seizing and planting. The whole village organized nineteen mutual aid teams, with a total of more than nine hundred men and women participating, and a total of one hundred and twenty head of cattle. Some plowed, some planted, some harvested, and some cut the grain ears in the fields (women and children). In this division of labor and assault, Guitun Village quickly reaped more than three hundred and sixty mu of millet in three days and seized the planting of fifteen qing, with plans to complete everything in five more days.
　　Other examples include Yongyun Village, which has transported all eight hundred and fifty mu of corn to the rear. Shangtun Village has transformed the terrain, and Shaqiu Shop has also transported all forty-odd large stones of grain stored at home. Because of insufficient labor, the masses in the rear were organized to help transport it, completing it overnight. (Chen Ping, Qi Yun)
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The millet is ripe, and the Sixth District of Tangyin has begun an organized armed harvesting. Since the enemy occupied Caiyuan, Wang Jun and Li Fu, landlords from Xilonghua in the district, frightened the masses, saying that they would establish a township office in Xilonghua. The emancipated peasants dared not harvest the millet, and the landlords used their lackeys to harvest the millet of the masses. On the night of the 12th, we organized one hundred and fifty laborers, twenty-eight large carts, and the militia cooperated with the independent detachment to besiege the enemy and cover the masses' harvesting. Everyone said, "They don't even dare to come out of their nests at night." The harvest continued until three o'clock in the morning. In addition to the carts pulling away the harvest, everyone carried a load of millet back, harvesting a total of more than one hundred and fifty mu of millet, which can yield one hundred and twenty shi of grain, and picking one hundred and ten jin of cotton.

　　[This newspaper, Taihang dispatch] In order to cooperate with the great counter-offensive and protect the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the Shouyang Independent Battalion formulated a two-week plan. In addition to fighting, they seized all available gaps to help the local masses with the autumn harvest and wheat planting. The slogan was: "Fight wherever we go, harvest wherever we go, protect the autumn on one hand, and help the harvest on the other!" They also seized every opportunity to publicize our army's large-scale counter-offensive, telling the masses the victorious news of the counter-attacking armies. They adopted the method of harvesting grain while publicizing, and in just three days, they publicized to one hundred and forty-seven ordinary people (requiring each officer and soldier to publicize to at least one person) and helped the masses harvest about two hundred mu (Feng Yi).

　　太岳太行边地武装
  　主动出击保卫秋收
    【本报太岳十八日电】岳北边沿各县，一手拿枪一手秋收，在前面掩护的武装，采用主动出击。介休著名的张锡满战斗队，活跃于阎匪心脏，继上月赵家营战斗歼阎匪十名后，又于二日在原村堡与张兰车站出犯之阎匪遭遇。张锡满战斗队即沉着应战，激战十分钟，杀伤阎匪四名。灵石亦采用此种战法，在掌握情报中，了解情况后，即集中优势力量进行伏击或掏心战，捕捉与消灭敌人。同时为防止突然包围，又采用野外联防哨等方法，因此使后方得以组织劳力，进行秋收，尤其是霍县郭庄，因男人大部到前方担任警戒或支援前线，所以将妇女儿童都组织起来，并规定了较大与现交工资方法，摘花一斤，给工资花二两，收玉茭一亩，给工资五升，剥玉茭一石，给工资一斗。在这种鼓励之下，男女老少齐上地，作到了熟一块收一块，快收、快打、快藏。
    【本报讯】博爱边地联防指挥部于九月二十八日，召开了前面三个区二十个村的村干部功臣积极分子六百余人护粮抢种动员大会，揭发和打破了妥协或轻敌麻痹思想，在“决不维持敌人，年年防旱，夜夜防贼，不让敌人抢走一粒粮，不留一亩白地”的口号下，各村开展了热烈的护粮抢种大竞赛运动。部队轮战队结合当地民兵，日夜活动于距敌据点一二里的六家作、北朱村、王伏林，白天抢收，黑夜埋雷，劲头很大。在武装保卫下，边沿各村劳力畜力已全部组织起来，和贵屯以行政村为单位，组织起护粮抢种委员会、下设武装保卫、劳畜力组织、宣传鼓动三股、统一计划，指挥抢救抢种，全村共组织互助大队十九个，参加男女劳力共九百余人，每大队下分若干小组，畜力共组织一百二十犋。有的耕、有的种、有的收，有的在场切谷穗（妇女小孩）。在这样分工突击中，贵屯村三天即抢割谷子三百六十余亩，抢种十五顷，计划再有五天即全部完成。
    其他如永运村，也已将八百五十余亩玉茭全部运到后方，上屯村改造了地形，沙邱铺把家存的四十余大石粮，也全部运出，因劳力不够，后方群众组织起来，去帮助搬运，一夜完成。（陈平、启运）
    【本报讯】谷子熟了，汤阴六区开始了有组织的武装抢收，自敌人占了菜园，该区西隆化地主王均、李福等，吓唬群众，说要在西隆化成立乡公所，翻身农民不敢割谷，地主们便利用狗腿，收割群众的谷子。十二日夜，我们组织了一百五十个劳力，二十八辆大车，民兵配合独立支队围困敌人，掩护群众收割，大家说：“他黑夜连窝边也不敢出。”收割至下三点钟，除大车拉走的外，每人背上一个谷子返回，共割谷一百五十余亩，可打一百二十石粮食，摘棉花一百一十斤。
    （汤阴小报）
    【本报太行讯】为了配合大反攻，保卫秋收种麦，寿阳独立营订出两周计划，除打仗外，抓紧一切空隙给当地群众收秋种麦，口号是：“打到那里，收到那里，一面保秋，一面助收！”并抓紧一切机会宣传我军大举反攻，把各路反攻大军的胜利消息，都告给群众，采取了一面割谷，一面宣传，仅三天时间即宣传了一百四十七个老百姓（要求每个指战员至少宣传一个群众），帮助群众收割约二百余亩（凤仪）
