Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 2nd. Many heartwarming stories about the People's Liberation Army are circulating in the newly liberated areas of western Henan. A comrade from a unit directly under a certain brigade picked some eggplants from a local villager's field in Huairen Village, Xin'an County. Because the villager wasn't home, he left some legal tender (法币) on the eggplant trellis. This incident quickly spread throughout the entire village. Another unit entered Xiaoxizhuang Village, Luoyang, late at night. Because the masses didn't know the People's Liberation Army was coming, they locked their doors and fled. Although it was raining, the troops used tarpaulins to set up shelters and camped in the field. No one touched the doors of the ordinary people. The next day, the masses returned and were extremely moved by this scene. They called their families back. When the troops moved out, they insisted on them staying. When a special service company of a certain unit was stationed in Longyu Village, a landlord left her baby, less than a month old, at home when she left. She came back in the middle of the night, worried. Our army quickly apologized and explained the situation. The landlord saw that nothing in the room had been moved and the child was sleeping peacefully, while the soldiers were sleeping on the ground. Furthermore, because the landlord was a young woman, the soldiers who were staying in the house moved out that very night. All the villagers said that the People's Liberation Army was truly disciplined.

　　豫西我军爱民群众极为感动
    【新华社豫西前线二日电】豫西新解放区流传着人民解放军的许多佳话，某旅直属队有个同志，在新安怀仁村摘吃了老乡的茄子，因为老乡不在，于是把法币放在茄子架上，这件事很快就传遍了全村。另部深夜进驻洛阳小西桩村，群众因为不知道是解放军要来，因此都锁了门逃跑一空。天虽然下着雨，但是部队都用油布搭起棚子在场里露营，没有任何人碰一碰老百姓的门。第二天群众回来见到这情形极为感动，把家人都叫了回来，部队转移时坚留不让走。某部特务连在龙玉村住时，某房东走时把不满月的娃娃留在家里，半夜放心不下回来了，我军连忙道歉解释，老乡看见房中东西都没动，孩子安然而睡，军队则睡在地下。又因为房东是年青女人，所以住在房内的军队就连夜搬出房子。全村老百姓都说解放军真有规矩。
