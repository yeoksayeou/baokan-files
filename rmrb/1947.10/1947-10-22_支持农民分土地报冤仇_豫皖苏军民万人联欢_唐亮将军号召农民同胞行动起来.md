　　Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Wan-Su Front, 20th. A unit of Chen and Su's army held a grand rally with ten thousand participants on the 15th with the local peasants. Peasants from dozens of miles away, holding spears and rifles, arrived to participate with big red flags emblazoned with "The Poor Turning Over." Amidst military music, the People's Liberation Army marched into the venue in formation, with thousands of peasants cheering along the sides, casting joyful gazes at the various new weapons in the soldiers' hands. The peasants pointed at the half-length portrait of Chairman Mao, saying, "This is Chairman Mao! He is the one who told us to turn over!" At the meeting, General Tang Liang, Director of the Political Department of the East China Field Army, resolutely declared to the peasants: "Our People's Liberation Army will take root and establish itself here, resolutely help the people of Yu-Wan-Su to turn over, eliminate the Chiang troops and Chiang's special agents, and defeat the local bullies, despots, and landlords." He called on peasant compatriots to "boldly take action, equally distribute the land, and seek revenge for grievances!" All the peasants in the audience shouted in unison: "We want our lifeline back! Uproot the Chiang regime!" The soldiers shouted: "Resolutely support the peasants in turning over!" "Fight for the people to obtain land!" Applause and slogans resounded for a long time. Deputy Commissioner Dong of the democratic government and County Magistrate Zhang Xiaonan called on everyone to: "Cherish the army and do a good job in logistics work"; "Unite closely with the People's Liberation Army to build the Yu-Wan-Su base area." At this time, Zhao Guangping, a peasant representative whose wife and children had died of cold and hunger, took the stage to speak. He said: "We have turned over and divided the land, we must thank the Communist Party, and follow the Communist Party!" "The front and the rear work together to defeat both big and small Chiang Kai-shek!" After the meeting, the PLA cultural troupe and local liberated drama troupes performed to add to the excitement.

　　Xinhua News Agency, E-Yu-Wan Front, 20th. Chiang bandit planes blindly bomb and strafe peaceful residents in the Dabie Mountains. Near Popi River in Guangshan, two merchants carrying cotton were killed and one injured by machine-gun fire; in a small mountain village west of Baiqueyuan, a farmer's water buffalo was bombed to death. Near Shangcheng, Chiang bandit planes wantonly strafed farmers who were harvesting rice in the fields, killing and injuring two people. Earlier this month, Chiang's planes dropped incendiary bombs between Macheng and Jingfu, burning down several farmers' thatched houses. This kind of crazy atrocity by Chiang's planes, which has no military effect, has aroused extreme resentment among the people in the Dabie Mountains.

  　豫皖苏军民万人联欢
    唐亮将军号召农民同胞行动起来
    【新华社豫皖苏前线二十日电】陈粟大军某部十五日与驻地农民举行盛大之万人联欢大会，数十里外农民手执长矛钢枪，打着“穷人翻身”大红旗赶来参加。在军乐声中，解放军整队入场，千万农民夹道欢呼，对战士们手中的各种新式武器投以喜悦的目光。农民们纷纷指着毛主席半身大像说：“这就是毛主席呀！就是他叫我们翻身的呀！”会上，华东野战军政治部主任唐亮将军坚决向农民宣称：“我们解放军要在这里生根立足，坚决帮助豫皖苏群众翻身，消灭蒋军蒋特，打垮土顽恶霸和地主。”他号召农民同胞“大胆行动起来，平分土地，伸冤报仇！”全场农民一齐高呼：“要回命根子！刨倒蒋根！”战士们则高呼：“坚决支持农民翻身！”“为人民获得土地而打仗！”掌声与口号声经久不息。民主政府董副专员与张效南县长号召大家：“爱护军队，做好后勤工作”；“和解放军紧密团结，建设豫皖苏根据地。”此时一位老婆孩子都已冻饿而死的农民代表赵光平登台演说，他说：“咱们分了土地翻了身，要感谢共产党，跟共产党走！”“前方后方一齐努力，打光大小蒋介石！”会后由解放军文工团与地方的翻身剧团演戏助兴。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二十日电】蒋匪飞机盲目轰炸扫射大别山区和平居民。在光山泼皮河附近，两个挑棉花的商人被机枪扫射一死一伤；在白雀园以西的小山庄中，把农民的一只水牛炸死。在商城附近，蒋匪飞机对准正在田里割稻子的农民滥肆扫射，亦死伤二人。本月初旬，蒋机在麻城、经扶间投下燃烧弹，烧燃农民茅屋数间。蒋机此种毫无军事效果的疯狂暴行，引起大别山区人民的极度愤恨。
