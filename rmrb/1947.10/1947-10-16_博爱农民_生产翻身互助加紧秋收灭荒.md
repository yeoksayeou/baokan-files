Bo'ai Peasants
Production Increases, Situation Overturned, Mutual Aid Intensifies Autumn Harvest and Eliminates Wasteland
[Our Newspaper Taihang Dispatch, 14th] After two months of land reform in Bo'ai, peasants have recovered 130,000 mu of land obtained through their blood and sweat (50,000 mu last year). Under the slogan "Return the Treasure Bowl, Distribute it to the Gods of Wealth," they are organizing production and overturning the mutual aid groups. For the first time in history, they are launching a large-scale autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign to eliminate wasteland on their own land. Since the occupation of the county by the Chiang bandits last year, a total of more than 50,000 mu of good land has been abandoned, accounting for one-sixth of the county's land. After the peasants were allocated this land, they resolved to eliminate it completely. In the Chengguan District, there are a total of 4,000 mu of wasteland. Due to the challenge competition launched by the thirteen streets to eliminate wasteland and plant wheat, 2,000 mu of wasteland have been transformed into wheat fields within ten days. In Gao Miao Street, 282 male and female laborers organized seven mutual aid groups based on the principle of voluntary association. Women and children pulled weeds in front, while men plowed and planted behind. In five days, 120 mu of the village's 341 mu of wasteland were eliminated. Within half a month, Sanyi Township not only planted all 400 mu of existing wasteland but also dug ditches to divert water into the river from a 200-mu depression, and planted wheat on it as well. The competition conditions for this village and Nanguan Street are: (1) prioritize the elimination of wasteland belonging to military dependents and orphans; (2) voluntary mutual aid groups are reserve turning-over groups, striving to identify the roots of poverty during the day through production and struggle at night. In addition to planting more than 400 mu of wasteland, Beiguan Street also dug a river, freeing up more than 100 mu of good land, which is now being planted. In order to ensure the successful completion of planting all the land, the District Office awarded a banner with the words "Triple Combination of Production, War, and Turning Over." The enthusiasm for planting in the Second District is even greater. In more than ten villages, including Beishizi and Xizhuang, the fruit gardens of the landlords were confiscated after liberation. The sale of only crabapple fruits generated more than 2 million yuan. They intend to use all this money to buy livestock for planting. Xizhuang Village has already bought back eight oxen, and Qianli and Beihou Villages have also bought back more than forty. Peasant Zhang Tushen of Beihou Village said, "...This year, we were given the Treasure Bowl, and next year, we will make a fortune..." In the Third District, fifteen villages, including Dongjiangou, where the turning over has been more thorough, have generally organized turning-over mutual aid groups, eliminating 3,000 mu of wasteland. A turning-over peasant in Dongjiangou Village said, "Missing one season delays a year. If we don't plant wheat this autumn, we will go hungry next year. In the past, we wanted to plant but had no land. Now that we have land, we must plant it..." On September 26, the Fourth District held a mobilization meeting of more than 1,000 activists to plant wheat and eliminate wasteland. Within ten days, 4,000 mu of the district's 10,000 mu of wasteland were planted. Xijingcheng organized all the men, women, and children in the village. Women and children harvested the autumn crops and pulled weeds in front, while men plowed and planted behind. Within three days, they harvested all the autumn crops and planted nearly 1,000 mu of wheat. The entire county is now engaged in large-scale planting. Of the county's 280,000 mu of land, at least 200,000 mu can be planted with wheat.

    【本报太行十四日电】博爱经过两月土改，农民已收回血汗土地十三万亩（去年五万亩），在“端回聚宝盆，分给活财神”的口号下，组织生产翻身互助组，有史以来第一次在自己的土地上，展开大规模的秋收种麦消灭荒地运动。该县自去年蒋匪占领以来，共荒好地五万余亩，占全县土地六分之一，农民分到后，决心把它消灭净。城关区共四千亩荒地，由于十三个街，掀起了灭荒种麦挑战竞赛，十天内已有两千亩荒地变为麦田。高庙街男女二百八十二个劳力，以自愿结合原则，组织起七个互助小组，妇女和儿童前面拔草，男人即在后面犁刨下种，全村三百四十一亩荒地，在五天中就消灭了一百二十亩；三义乡半月内除将现有荒地四百亩全部下种外，又将二百亩大的一块积水坑，挖沟引水入河，也种上麦子。该村和南关街的竞赛条件是：（一）先消灭军属孤寡荒地；（二）自愿结合的互助组，就是备战翻身组，做到白天生产找穷根，夜间斗争。北关街除四百余亩荒地下种外，也挖河一道，空出好地一百余亩，现正下种。区署为使全部土地下种胜利完成，做了一面“生产、战争、翻身三大结合”的锦旗进行奖励。二区闹养种劲头更大，北十字、西庄等十余村，解放后算回地主的果木园，仅花红果子即卖二百余万元，他们要将此钱全部买成牲口下种，西庄村已买回耕牛八头，前礼、背后两村，也买回四十余头。背后村农民张土申说：“……今年分到聚宝盆，明年就要大发财……。”三区东涧沟等十五个翻身较彻底村，已普遍组织起翻身互助组，消灭荒地三千亩。东涧沟村一个翻身农民说：“误了一季，耽误一年，今秋不种麦，明年要饿肚，往年想种没地，今年有了地定要种上它……。”四区于九月二十六日，召开了一千多人的积极分子动员种麦灭荒会，全区一万亩荒地，十天中就种了四千亩。西井城将全村男女老幼组织起来，妇女儿童前面收秋拔草，男人在后面马上犁地下种，三天内收了全部秋，种了麦子近千亩。现全县正在大规模的下种，全县二十八万亩土地，最少可播种小麦二十万亩。
