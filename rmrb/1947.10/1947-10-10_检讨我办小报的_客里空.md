　　A Self-Criticism of My Small Newspaper's "Armchair Theorizing"
　　Zhang Yiying

　　When I attended the Taihang News Communication and Reporting Conference in August this year, I had already examined some of the "armchair theorizing" ideology, but I didn't fully understand the harm of this ideology. I felt that although "armchair theorizing" was not good, its starting point was not bad. Therefore, I didn't take it seriously during the examination. Recently, after studying the self-criticism of the Jin-Sui Daily, I became alert to this problem and it inspired my thorough examination. Here, I will expose my "armchair theorizing" in editing small newspapers and writing news.

　　I have been editing small newspapers for almost half a year. Every time I edited, I always wanted to add a few sentences to make the text and meaning more "beautiful" and more "artistic," so that people would feel very comfortable when they read it. I didn't care whether it was consistent with reality, nor did I care about the prestige and role of the small newspaper. As long as it was written fluently, I thought it was good. For example, after the "Wu'an People" small newspaper published a message about the "Chaiquan Canal Repair" in the Second District in its fifth issue, it caused a great dispute between the masses of Tian Village in the Fourth District and the masses of Chaiquan, and they almost fought. It turned out that Chaiquan and Tian Village shared a river. Chaiquan had newly built a canal that could irrigate 400 mu of land, but when Chaiquan irrigated, Tian Village could not irrigate, and the water fields in Tian Village would become dry land. When Chaiquan was repairing the canal, they did not notify the masses of Tian Village. Moreover, some of the land in Chaiquan was already water fields and could be irrigated by wells, but this method was more convenient. The person who wrote the news wrote in the original manuscript that the masses of Chaiquan had discussed it with the Fourth District. When I revised the manuscript, I felt that this was not complete enough, so I added a few sentences: "With the help of the government, the masses of these two villages went to a joint discussion meeting, and everyone was very happy." And I also added that a 60-year-old man said: "As far as I can remember, this canal has been repaired several times but has not been completed. This year, under the leadership of the government, everyone worked together and it can be considered completed. The Communist Party is really capable!..."

　　The masses of Tian Village were originally preparing to file a lawsuit with the masses of Chaiquan. When they saw this small newspaper, it aroused even greater dissatisfaction among the masses. The masses scolded the village cadres for selling out the canal, and why they didn't discuss with the masses after the meeting (but in fact, the village cadres didn't hold a meeting). The village cadres then led the masses to Chaiquan to file a lawsuit and make trouble. Fortunately, Chief Li of the Construction Section of the county government stopped them and solved the problem, otherwise it would have caused a big dispute. Later, the writer also sent a letter to inquire, the masses also scolded the small newspaper, and the cadres of the Fourth District all said that the small newspaper was "armchair theorizing." This not only did not play a good role, but played a great negative role. If the ideology of "armchair theorizing" is not seriously examined, its harm is unimaginable.

　　检讨我办小报的“客里空”
    张一英
    今年八月我参加太行新闻通讯报导会议的时候，对“客里空”思想虽然已检查了一部分，但是对“客里空”的思想的害处还认识不够，觉得客里空虽然不好，但是他的出发点并不是坏的，如此在检查时也就没有把它当成一回事。最近我在学习了晋绥日报的自我批评以后，才对此问题有了警惕，并启发了我的彻底检查。这里就来揭发我编小报写新闻的“客里空”。
    我在编小报将近半年了，在我每次编的时候，总想给人家加添几句，求得文字上，意思上，更“美丽”一些，更“艺术”一点，使人看了觉得很舒服，也不管是否和实际相符，也不管小报的威信与作用，只要写得流利就认为好。如在“武安人民”小报第五期上发表了关于二区“柴泉修渠”消息以后，使四区田村的群众和柴泉的群众起了很大纠纷，几乎打起架来。原来是柴泉和田村伙着一道河水，柴泉新修了道渠，可以浇地四百亩，但是柴泉一浇地，田村就不能浇了，田村的水地就要变旱地。柴泉在修渠的时候，也未通知田村群众，况且柴泉这些地就有些是水地，可以用井浇，不过这样更便利一些。写这消息的人在原稿上写着柴泉群众和四区商量过，我在改稿子时候，觉得这样还不够完整，便填了几句：“在政府的帮助下，这两个村的群众就到一处开了个联合商讨会，大家都很高兴”。并且还加了一个六十岁的老汉说：“从我记得到现在，这渠修了好几回没修起，今年在政府的领导下，大家动手，可算修成了。共产党真是有办法！……”
    田村群众本来正准备和柴泉群众闹官司，一看到这个小报，便更引起了群众的不满，群众骂村干部出卖了水渠，为什么开了会不和群众商量（而实际上村干部也没开会）。村干部便率领群众到柴泉打官司闹纠纷，幸亏县府建设科李科长挡回去，把这问题解决了，不然会引起很大纠纷。后来使写稿人也来信追问，群众也骂小报，四区干部都说小报是“客里空”。这不但没起了好的作用，反而起了很大的反作用。如果对“客里空”的思想不加以严重的检讨，它的为害是不堪设想的。
