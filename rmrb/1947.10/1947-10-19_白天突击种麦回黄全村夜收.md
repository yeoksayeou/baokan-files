　　Daytime Blitz to Sow Wheat, Return to Harvest - Entire Village Harvests at Night
    [Our Newspaper, Xiyang News] After the weather cleared in Huihuang Village, Second District, it was urgent to sow wheat and also urgent to harvest autumn crops. Sowing wheat would hinder the autumn harvest, and harvesting autumn crops would interfere with sowing wheat. Combining autumn harvest and wheat sowing would mean there weren't enough people to allocate. Faced with these problems, discussions were first held within each group. Three mutual aid groups in Lower Street proposed: sow wheat during the day and harvest at night. Everyone agreed. On the night of the fourteenth day of the lunar month, under the moonlight, more than thirty people in Lower Street, led by Zhao Huaibao, harvested seven mu of grain in one night. The next day, they were immediately commended on the broadcasting platform, which promoted the mutual aid groups throughout the village. On the fifteenth and sixteenth, all the male laborers in the village were involved in the night harvest. Zhao Huaibao also led the specific division of labor for wheat sowing and autumn harvesting. During the day, all the able-bodied male laborers completely blitzed wheat sowing, while women, children, and old men harvested. It was also proposed to harvest one piece of land and then cultivate another. Now, more than twenty plows of oxen have been put to work. Under this kind of combination, in four days and three nights, more than forty mu of wheat were sown and more than six hundred mu of autumn crops were harvested. Of the entire village's one thousand seven hundred mu of land, more than one-third has already been harvested. Yams, small beans, millet, etc., have all been harvested, and one-third of the millet has been harvested, and autumn plowing is being blitzed as well. (Xinyin, Mang Xiao)

　　白天突击种麦回黄全村夜收
    【本报昔阳讯】二区回黄村，天晴后，麦子紧该种，秋也紧该收，种麦吧不能秋收，秋收吧又妨碍种麦，秋收与种麦结合作吧，人又不够分配。遇到了这些问题，首先就在各组进行了酝酿讨论，下街三个互助组提出：白天种麦，黑夜收割，大家都很同意。阴历十四日黑夜的月光下，下街三十多个人，在赵怀保领导下，一夜收谷七亩，第二天马上在广播台上进行了表扬，推动了全村互助组，十五、十六全村的男劳力都卷入了夜收，并有赵怀保领导进行了种麦与秋收具体的分工，白天男全劳力完全突击种麦，妇女儿童老汉收割，黑夜全部参加收割。又提出收一块耕一块，现二十多犋牛都上了套，在这样的结合下，四天三黑夜共种麦四十余亩，收秋六百余亩，全村一千七百余亩地，已收了三分之一强，山药、小豆、黍子等都已收完，谷子收三分之一，并在突击秋耕中。（新颖、忙小）
