[This article was transmitted by our newspaper from Jinan on the 20th] The results of the liberation of Yongnian have been verified as follows: Wang Zemin, commander of the First Column, and Xu Tieying, commander of the Second Column, as well as Yang Yicai, the puppet county magistrate of Yongnian (it was previously mistakenly reported that Xu and Yang were captured alive), and more than 280 other officers and soldiers were killed. More than 1,200 officers and soldiers, including Zhong Yulin, commander of the Yongnian District of the Kuomintang, Guo Zhifang, chief of staff of the First Brigade, and Wang Mengbi, secretary-general of the Yongnian County Committee of the Chiang Kai-shek Party, were captured. A total of more than 1,500 people were killed or captured, and one airplane (with six machine guns attached), three heavy machine guns, twenty-five light machine guns, six grenade launchers, more than 1,300 rifles and carbines, 158 pistols, more than 300,000 rounds of various bullets, more than 2,000 hand grenades, and two radio stations (not counting those captured by the militia), and many other military supplies were seized. In addition, more than 600 "Returning Home Corps" members, traitors, and local tyrants were captured.

[Another Dispatch] All the bandit leaders of Yongnian have been captured. Zhong Yulin, the puppet bandit commander of Yongnian appointed by Chiang Kai-shek, broke through the encirclement with Wang Zemin and Xu Tieying on the night of the 5th, and was captured alive by several service personnel of the Second Battalion Headquarters of our unit in the east of Liyuan Village, north of the city. When the unarmed cooks and barbers were seizing guns from Zhong Yulin and his followers, Zhong Yulin shouted in terror, "I am Zhong Yulin." The bandit leader Tie Motou led 400 men to break through on the night of the 5th, and more than 200 of them were killed in front of our army's fortifications. He only led more than 100 men to flee in a panic towards Anyang in the south. One of our units followed closely, while another unit intercepted them in the south, annihilating them all in Lujiazhuang, Chengci. The bandit Tie was also killed at the same time. The traitor Yang Yicai, the puppet county magistrate of Yongnian, broke through with Wang Zemin on the night of the 5th, lost contact after leaving the city, lost his way, and drowned himself in a well northwest of Shiguan Ying Village, northwest of the city. Zhai Fuli, the regimental commander of Wang Zemin's bandit gang, sneaked to Chongbao, southwest of the city, on the night of the 5th, and was discovered by the villagers. They immediately reported to our army, and two squads from our guard company rushed to the scene and killed him.
