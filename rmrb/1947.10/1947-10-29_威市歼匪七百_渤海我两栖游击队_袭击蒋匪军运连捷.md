Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 27th: The People's Liberation Army has continuously repelled Chiang's troops attempting to invade Weihai City. The 322nd Regiment of the 108th Brigade of the 25th Division of Chiang's army, which landed ten li northeast of Weihai City at Banyue Man, repeatedly attacked the PLA positions fiercely, but were all repelled. We have killed or wounded over 700 enemies in recent days. As of the 24th, the enemy was still blocked in the Mianhua Mountain, six li northeast of Weihai City, and the Dongshan Garden area, just over two li northeast of Weihai City.

Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liao, 27th: The amphibious guerrilla forces of the People's Liberation Army are becoming increasingly active in the area south of the Ninglu Railway and on the Bohai Sea in northeastern Hebei. Chiang's military transport vessels are frequently attacked. On the 14th of this month, the guerrilla team pursued and captured a Chiang army transport ship in the waters west of Qinhuangdao, capturing over ten enemy soldiers and guns, as well as a portion of military supplies. On the 15th, over a thousand troops from the 168th Regiment of the 56th Division of Chiang's army in Leting and a unit of puppet police forces launched an offensive along the coast but were also defeated by the guerrilla team, with over a hundred enemies killed or captured and one heavy machine gun and five light machine guns seized.
