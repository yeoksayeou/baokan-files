Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. UNRRA Director Rooks left China for the United States on the 22nd, and UNRRA China Office Director Cleveland also accompanied him. Rooks' two-week stay in China fully demonstrated that their purpose was solely to follow the will of American imperialism, to continue to use UNRRA as a tool for unilaterally aiding Chiang in the civil war, and to use UNRRA to make further arrangements for the development of American financial capital's power in China. Rooks' statement at a press conference in Shanghai on the 21st regarding his work in China also clearly shows this point. When Rooks first arrived in China, he openly expressed "sympathy" for the Kuomintang's shameless behavior of obstructing relief supplies from entering the Liberated Areas, and based on his stated position of "not forcing the Kuomintang government to comply with UNRRA's obligations." In this "statement," Rooks again heartlessly avoided mentioning the fact that UNRRA has fundamentally violated its relief policy over the past two years, delivering more than 98 percent of the 2.3 million tons of relief supplies shipped to China (as of the end of September) to the Kuomintang, and allowing them to use it for corruption and to turn it into civil war capital, while only a very small amount of 32,900 tons, less than 2 percent, was used for relief to the Liberated Areas, which accounted for more than 60 percent of the disaster-stricken refugees in the country. He shamelessly declared that he was "satisfied" with the work of UNRRA and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) in China. In order to express his enthusiasm for aiding Chiang in the civil war, Rooks has decided to hand over the existing 200,000 bales of UNRRA cotton to the Kuomintang CRRRA as funding for the so-called "long-term post-disaster projects." CRRRA will use the method of "7.125 pounds of cotton in exchange for 400 pounds or 440 pounds of yarn" to exchange it for cotton yarn from the Kuomintang bureaucratic organization "China Textile Industries Corporation," and then sell it to the Kuomintang Central Bank, so that the four major families can profit at every level, fill their own pockets, and turn it into civil war capital. The "multilateral agreement" on this matter was signed in Nanjing on the 21st. This is completely the same in nature as the crime of UNRRA allowing the Chiang government to sell US$49 million of relief cotton on the black market to fund civil war expenses in February this year. As for the issue of relief to the Liberated Areas, Rooks has always adopted a perfunctory attitude. Even on the issue of the shipment of 50,000 tons of relief supplies that should have been shipped long ago, his statement still states that the "difficulties are being resolved." Regarding the Yellow River dike project, in addition to mentioning that "the construction of the dikes has been decided to be completed by the end of November," he did not mention a word about the second phase of the dike construction funds owed by UNRRA to the General Relief Administration. This shows that Rooks has no interest in China's real relief work. Rooks declared that after UNRRA officially ends on December 30 this year, UNRRA's affiliated institutions, such as the CRRRA Fisheries Management Office, the CRRRA Machinery and Equipment Depot, the CRRRA Agricultural Rehabilitation Corporation, and the CRRRA Air Transport Corps (i.e., Chennault's Air Transport Corps), will continue to exist, but nominally they will be led by the "Post-War Rehabilitation Committee" recently established by the Chiang Kai-shek authorities and the "Trusteeship Committee" jointly led by Chiang and the United States. It is said that the post-war materials handed over by UNRRA, including industrial equipment alone, amount to more than US$100 million. In addition, some of UNRRA's so-called "specialized" personnel will also remain in China to participate in leading the work. As we all know, the above-mentioned institutions were originally controlled by American capital and technology to carry out economic aggression against China. The CRRRA Air Transport Corps also engaged in civil war business, undertaking war transportation for Chiang Kai-shek, which was even more open and secret. This is what Rooks called "the CRRRA Air Transport Corps has achieved quite good results and has greatly benefited UNRRA and the Chinese government (referring to the Chiang government)." As for the CRRRA Water Transport Corps, which Rooks announced would be "resolved," the China Fisheries United Office revealed in an open letter to Rooks on the 21st that it was only "to supply most of the available fishing boats of the team to the newly formed Sino-American Fisheries Company, which has the right to operate on the Chinese sea and will control the entire Chinese fishing industry." The letter also revealed that UNRRA fishing boats operating in Chinese waters in the past year have dumped their catches on the open market,抢夺中国渔业生意, and caused violent fluctuations in fish prices, resulting in the inability of China's private fisheries to survive. This fact fully exposes UNRRA's face in helping the United States invade China, and specifically shows the real content of Rooks' work in China.

　　鲁克斯假借联总救济为名
  　来华发展美经济势力
    联总续作援蒋内战工具
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】联总署长鲁克斯已于二十二日离华返美，联总中国分署署长克利夫兰亦偕同返美。鲁氏在华勾留两周，充分证明彼此来目的，仅系仰承美帝国主义意旨，使联总继充片面援蒋内战工具，和利用联总为美国金融资本发展在华势力作进一步布置。鲁氏二十一日在沪记者招待会上对其在华工作所作之声明，亦明白显示此点。鲁氏抵华之初，即公开对国民党阻挠救济物资进入解放区之无耻行为表示“同情”，并本其所宣称：“不迫使国民党政府遵守联总义务。”而此次“声明”中，鲁氏复忍心害理，对联总两年来根本违反其救济方针，以运华二百三十多万吨（截至九月底止）救济物资的百分之九十八以上交与国民党，且任其用以贪污和转充内战资本，而仅以三万二千九百多吨即不及百分之二的极少量物资，作为对占全国抗战受灾难民十分之六以上的解放区的救济的不合理事实，避而不谈，恬然宣称对联总及行总在华工作“表示满意”。鲁氏为表示其对援蒋内战之热心，已决定以现存之二十万包联总棉花交与国民党行总，充作所谓“长期善后事业”经费，由行总以“七一二五磅棉花易四百磅或四百四十磅纱”办法，交国民党官僚组合“中纺公司”换为棉纱，再售予国民党中央银行，以便四大家族，层层营利，饱其私囊，并转充内战资本。关于此事之“多边协定”于二十一日在南京签订。此与今年二月联总允许蒋政府以四千九百万美元救济棉花在黑市出售以充内战经费之罪恶性质完全相同。至对解放区救济问题，鲁氏却始终出以敷衍态度，即对早应运出的五万吨救济物资解运问题，在其声明中依然是“困难解决”，对黄河筑堤问题，除提到“河堤之修筑已决议定于十一月底完成”外，对联总所应付给解总之堤工堤款第二期欠额：只字未提，此显示鲁氏对中国真正救济工作并无兴趣，鲁氏宣称，在联总于今年十二月三十日正式结束后，联总附属机构行总渔业管理处，行总机械器材库，行总农业复兴公司及行总空运大队（即陈纳德空运大队）等均将继续存在，不过名义上改由蒋匪当局最近成立之“善后事业委员会”及由蒋美共同主持之“托管委员会”领导，据称联总交付之善后物资仅工业配备一项即达一亿美元以上。另外联总一部分所谓“专门”人员亦将留华参加领导该项工作。如众所知，上述各机构原皆为美国资本与技术控制，用以实行对华经济侵略者，行总空运大队且兼营内战生意，为蒋担任战争运输，更为公开秘密，此即鲁氏所谓“行总空运大队成绩颇佳，对行总与中国政府（指蒋政府）大有裨益。”至于鲁氏宣布“决予解决”之行总水运大队，据中国渔业联合办事处二十一日发表之致鲁克斯公开函中揭露，亦仅系“将该队大部可用渔船，供新近组成的有权在中国海面上活动，将要控制全部中国渔业的中美渔业公司使用。”该函并揭露过去一年来在中国海面活动之联总渔船，在公开市场上倾销所捕鱼，抢夺中国渔业生意，并引起鱼价激烈波动结果就使中国的民间渔业不能维持生存。此一事实充分暴露联总帮助美国侵华面目，并具体表明鲁克斯在华工作真正内容。
