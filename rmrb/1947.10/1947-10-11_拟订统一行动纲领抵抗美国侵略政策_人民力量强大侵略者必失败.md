Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. TASS Moscow, 6th: Pravda published a communiqué of the meeting of representatives of the Communist Parties of nine European countries. The reporting meeting was held in Poland at the end of September, with the participation of: Yugoslavia represented by Kardelj and Djilas, the Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist) represented by Chervenkov, Poptomov, the Romanian Communist Party represented by Dej and Pauker, the Hungarian Communist Party represented by Farkas and Revai, the Polish Workers' Party represented by Gomulka and Minc, the Soviet Communist Party (Bolshevik) represented by Zhdanov and Malenkov, the French Communist Party represented by Duclos and Fajon, the Czechoslovak Communist Party represented by Slánský and Bašťovanský, and the Italian Communist Party represented by Longo and Reale. The representatives attending the meeting listened to reports on the activities of the Central Committees of each party, which were presented by the following representatives: Kardelj and Djilas of the Yugoslav Communist Party, Chervenkov of the Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist), Dej of the Romanian Communist Party, Revai of the Hungarian Communist Party, Gomulka of the Polish Workers' Party, Malenkov of the Soviet Communist Party (Bolshevik), Duclos of the French Communist Party, Slánský of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and Longo of the Italian Communist Party. After exchanging views on these reports, the representatives attending the meeting decided to discuss the international situation and the issues of exchanging experiences and coordinating activities among the parties attending. Zhdanov (All-Union Communist Party) delivered a report on the international situation. The representatives attending the meeting exchanged views on this report and reached complete agreement on the current international situation and the tasks arising therefrom, and unanimously adopted a declaration on the international situation. Gomulka delivered a report on exchanging experiences and coordinating activities among the Communist Parties of various countries. In view of the adverse consequences of the lack of contact among the parties attending the meeting, and considering the necessity of exchanging experiences with each other, the meeting therefore decided to establish an INFORMATION BUREAU, which will be composed of representatives of the Central Committees of the aforementioned parties. Its task will be to organize the exchange of experiences among the parties, and, if necessary, to coordinate the activities of the parties on a mutually agreed basis. It was also decided that the Liaison Bureau may publish an official newspaper, and Belgrade was designated as the location of the Liaison Bureau and the editorial office of its official newspaper.

Declaration Exposes the United States' Vicious Aggressive Schemes and the Treacherous Behavior of the Right-Wing Socialists of Britain and France

The representatives of the Communist Parties of the nine countries attending the meeting unanimously adopted the following declaration: As a result of the Second World War and the developments in the post-war period, major changes have taken place in the international situation. These changes are: a new division of political forces active on the world stage, changes in the relations among the victorious countries of the Second World War, and their regrouping. While the war was in progress, the countries that formed an alliance against Germany and Japan moved forward together and formed a single camp. However, even during the war, there were differences of opinion within the Allied camp regarding the determination of war aims and the tasks of organizing the post-war world. The Soviet Union and the democratic countries believed that the main purpose of the war was to rebuild and consolidate the democratic order in Europe, eliminate Fascism and prevent another possibility of German aggression, and establish comprehensive and lasting cooperation among European countries; while the United States and Britain, which agreed with her, prescribed different war aims for themselves - to eliminate competitors in the market (Germany and Japan) and to develop their own dominance. This divergence in determining war aims and handling post-war problems began to deepen in the post-war period. Two opposing policy directions have taken shape: on the one hand, the policy of the Soviet Union and the democratic countries, aimed at destroying imperialism and consolidating democracy; on the other hand, the policy of the United States and Britain, aimed at strengthening imperialism and strangling democracy. In view of the fact that the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries have become an obstacle to the realization of the imperialist plan to seize world domination and destroy the democratic movement, they have launched a movement against the new democratic countries, supplemented by new war threats from the most fanatical imperialist politicians in the United States and Britain. As a result, two camps have emerged, one is the camp of imperialism and anti-democracy, whose main purpose is to establish the world domination of American imperialism and destroy democracy; the other is the camp of anti-imperialism and democracy, whose main purpose is to destroy imperialism and consolidate democracy, and eliminate the remnants of Fascism. The struggle between two opposing camps - imperialism and anti-imperialism - is taking place against the backdrop of a further deterioration of the general crisis of capitalism, the declining strength of capitalism, and the consolidation of the strength of the Soviet Union and the democratic countries. The imperialist camp and its guiding force, the United States, are carrying out activities with special aggressiveness. This activity is developing simultaneously in all aspects of military-strategic measures, economic expansion, and ideological struggle. The Truman and Marshall Plans are only one component of the overall plan for world expansion, that is, a chapter in this overall plan for Europe. And this plan is being implemented by the United States throughout the world. The American imperialist plan to economically and politically enslave Europe is supplemented by its plan to economically and politically enslave China, Indonesia, and South American countries. Yesterday's aggressors - the big capitalists of Germany and Japan - are being used by the United States to play a new role as tools of American imperialist policy in Europe and Asia. The strategic weapons used by the imperialist camp are diverse, with direct threats of force, bribery, and blackmail combined with various political and economic pressures, bribery, and the use of internal contradictions and conflicts to consolidate the position of this camp. And all of these are disguised by the mask of liberalism-appeasement, intending to deceive and lure politically inexperienced people in this way. A special place in the imperialist arsenal of tactics is the betrayal policy of right-wing socialists such as Blum in France, Attlee and Bevin in Britain, Schumacher in Germany, Renner and Schärf in Austria, and Saragat in Italy. These people try to disguise the true robber nature of imperialist policy with the rhetoric of "democracy" and "socialism." However, in fact, their actions in all aspects are loyal accomplices of the imperialists, creating divisions in the ranks of the working class and poisoning their consciousness. Therefore, it is no accident that British imperialist foreign policy has found in Bevin a person who is its most persistent and fanatical agent. Under these circumstances, the anti-imperialist democratic camp must consolidate itself, formulate a unanimously agreed-upon program of action, and formulate strategies against the main forces in the imperialist camp, against American imperialism and its British and French allies, and against right-wing socialists (mainly British and French). In order to smash the imperialist aggression plan, the joint efforts of all anti-imperialist democratic forces in Europe are needed; and the right-wing socialists are traitors to this task. But the new democratic countries are an exception; in the new democratic countries, the alliance of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other progressive democratic parties has become the basis for these countries to resist the imperialist plan. The socialist parties in most other countries, first of all the French Socialist Party and the British Labour Party - Ramadier, Blum, Attlee, Bevin - facilitate the implementation of American capital's plans with their submissiveness, encourage the extortion actions of American capital, and reduce their motherland to a vassal dependent on the United States. Therefore, the Communist Party has faced a special task: the Communist Party must raise high the banner of defending the independence and sovereignty of each country. If the Communist Parties can stick to their posts, not be intimidated or bought off, if they can bravely defend democracy, defend the sovereignty, freedom and independence of the motherland, and prove able to lead the forces defending glory and the independence of each country in the struggle against economic and political enslavement of various countries, then any plan to enslave European and Asian countries cannot be realized, which is one of the main tasks of the Communist Party at present. It must be remembered that there is a huge distance between imperialism's attempt to launch a new war and the possibility of organizing such a war. The people of the world do not want war, and the forces of maintaining peace are so strong that as long as they are strong and unyielding in the cause of defending peace, as long as they are calm and firm, the aggressors' plans will be completely defeated. It should not be forgotten that the imperialist agents' clamor about the danger of war is used to intimidate the weak and unstable elements, and to force them to make concessions to the aggressors by fraudulent means. Now, the main danger for the working class is underestimating its own strength and overestimating the strength of the imperialist camp. Just as the Munich policy of letting Hitler invade in the past, the current concessions to the United States and the new trends in the imperialist camp will make their instigators more arrogant and more aggressive. Therefore, the Communist Party must lead the resistance to the imperialist aggression and expansion plan in all aspects (national, political, economic, and ideological). The Communist Party must consolidate itself, coordinate actions on the basis of a common anti-imperialist and democratic program, and unite all the democratic and patriotic forces of the people around itself.

The resolution on exchanging experiences and coordinating actions among the Communist Parties of the participating countries is as follows: In view of the fact that in the current situation, the lack of connection among the Communist Parties of the participating countries is a serious shortcoming, experience shows that the lack of contact among the Communist Parties of the participating countries is wrong and harmful. At a time when the post-war international situation is becoming more complex, the need for the Communist Parties of various countries to exchange experiences and coordinate actions is particularly urgent. The lack of connection between the Communist Parties of various countries will harm the working class. In view of the above, the participants reached the following agreement: (1) Establish a Liaison Bureau, composed of representatives from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, the Workers' Party (Communist) of Bulgaria, the Communist Party of Romania, the Communist Party of Hungary, the Workers' Party of Poland, the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of France, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and the Communist Party of Italy. (2) The task of the Liaison Bureau is to organize the exchange of experiences, and, when necessary, to coordinate the activities of the Communist Parties on a mutually agreed basis. (3) The Liaison Bureau shall be composed of two representatives from the Central Committee of each party, and each representative shall be appointed and replaced by the Central Committee of each party. (4) The Liaison Bureau shall publish an official publication, initially a semi-monthly publication, then a weekly publication, printed in French and Russian, and may use other languages when possible. (5) The Liaison Bureau shall be located in the city of Belgrade.

    拟订统一行动纲领抵抗美国侵略政策
    人民力量强大侵略者必失败

    宣言揭露美国毒辣侵略计谋及英法社会党右翼叛卖行为
    出席会议的九国共产党代表们一致通过下述宣言：由于第二次世界大战的结果，及在战后时期中的发展，国际情势已发生了重大变化，这些变化是：在世界舞台上活跃的政治力量之新的划分，第二次世界大战胜利国关系的改变及其重新组合。当战争在进行时，结成联盟反对德日的各国共同前进，并形成单一的阵营。可是，纵使在战时，盟国阵营关于确定战争目的与战后世界组织的任务，仍有意见分歧。苏联及各民主国家认为战争主要目的在于重建及巩固欧洲民主秩序、消灭法西斯主义并阻止德国方面另一次侵略的可能性，建立欧洲各国间全面的持久合作；而美国以及和她一致的英国，都给自己规定了不同的战争目的——扫除市场的竞争者（德国与日本）及发展它们自己的统治权。这种对于确定战争目的及处理战后问题任务之分歧，在战后时期开始变得更加深刻了。两种相反的政策方针已经形成了：在一方面是苏联及民主各国的政策，目的在摧毁帝国主义及巩固民主，另一方面是美国和英国的政策，目的在加强帝国主义及绞杀民主。鉴于苏联及各新民主主义国家变成了一种障碍，妨害了夺取世界统治权及毁灭民主运动之帝国主义计划的实现，于是，它们便发动了反对新民主主义各国的运动，而且辅以美英两国中最狂热的帝国主义政客方面的新战争威胁。因而发生了两个阵营，一个是帝国主义与反民主的阵营，其主要目的是建立美国帝国主义的世界统治及摧毁民主；一个是反帝国主义与民主阵营，其主要目的是摧毁帝国主义及巩固民主，消灭法西斯主义残余。两个相反阵营——帝国主义与反帝国主义间的斗争，是在资本主义总危机进一步恶化，资本主义的力量日渐下降，苏联及各民主国家的力量巩固的情况下发生的。帝国主义阵营及其指导力量的美国，遂施展具有特殊侵略性的活动。这种活动同时在军事战略措施、经济扩张与思想斗争的各方面发展起来。杜鲁门与马歇尔计划不过是世界扩张政策总计划的一个组成部分，也就是这总计划中的欧洲的一章。而这计划正由美国在世界各处实行中，美国帝国主义在经济与政治上奴役欧洲的计划是以它在经济上与政治上奴役中国、印尼及南美各国的计划来补充的。昨天的侵略者——德、日大资本家——正被美国用来扮演新的角色，以作美国帝国主义政策在欧、亚两洲的工具。帝国主义阵营所应用的策略武器是多种多样的，直接的武力威胁、收买与勒索结合着各种各样的政治、经济压力、贿赂以及利用内部矛盾与冲突的方法，以巩固这一阵营的地位。而所有这些都是由自由主义——绥靖主义的假面具伪装起来，打算这样来欺骗与诱惑缺乏政治经验的人民。帝国主义分子策略武库中的特殊地方是利用法国勃鲁姆，英国艾德礼、贝文，德国舒马赫，奥地利雷纳尔、塞尔夫及意大利萨拉盖特之流的右翼社会党人的背叛政策。这些人力图用“民主”与“社会主义”的辞藻伪装，来掩蔽帝国主义政策的真正强盗性质。然而事实上他们在各方面的行动都是帝国主义分子的忠实帮手，造成工人阶级队伍中的分裂，并毒化他们的意识。因此，英国帝国主义的外交政策，找到了贝文这个人做它的最坚持不懈及狂热的代理人，这并不是偶然的。在这种情况下，反帝国主义的民主阵营必需巩固自己，拟订一致同意的行动纲领，拟定反对帝国主义阵营中主要力量、反对美国帝国主义及其英国与法国同盟者、反对右翼社会党（主要是英国与法国）的策略。为了粉碎帝国主义侵略计划，需要欧洲所有反帝国主义的民主力量共同努力；而右翼社会党是这一任务的叛徒。但新民主主义国家则属例外；在新民主主义国家中，共产党、社会党及其他进步民主党派之联盟，成为这些国家抵抗帝国主义计划的基础。大部分其他国家的社会党，首先即是法国社会党与英国工党——拉马第，勃鲁姆，艾德礼，贝文——以他们的卑躬屈节便利美国资本实行其计划，激励美国资本的勒索行动，并将其祖国沦为仰赖于美国的附庸。因此，共产党已面临特殊的任务：共产党必须高举保卫各该国家的独立与主权的义旗。各共产党若能坚守其岗位，不受恐吓与收买，它们若能勇敢地保卫民主，保卫祖国的主权、自由与独立，在反抗经济与政治上奴役各国的斗争中，证明能够领导卫护光荣与各该国家独立的力量，则任何奴役欧亚国家的计划都不能实现，这即是目前共产党主要任务之一。必须牢记：帝国主义之力图发动新战争，与组织此种战争的可能性之间，是有着巨大距离的。世界各民族不希望战争，维护和平的力量是如此强大，只要他们在保卫和平的事业中坚强不屈，只要他们沉着与坚定，侵略者的计划必遭完全失败。不应忘记：帝国主义代理人，关于战争危险的叫嚣，是用以恐吓神经脆弱与不稳定的分子，并以欺诈手段迫使他们对侵略者让步。现在，工人阶级的主要危险是过低估计自己的力量与过高估计帝国主义阵营的力量。正如过去放任希特勒侵略的慕尼黑政策一样，现在对美国与帝国主义阵营新趋向的让步，会使他们的唆使者更骄横更富侵略性，因此共产党必须在各方面（国家、政治、经济与思想各方面）领导对帝国主义侵略与扩张计划的抵抗。共产党必须巩固自己，并在共同反帝国主义与民主纲领的基础上配合行动，并将一切人民的民主爱国力量团结在自己周围。
    关于与会各国共产党交换经验与配合行动决议如下：会议鉴于在目前情形之下，与会各国共产党之缺乏连系是一严重的缺点，经验显示与会各国共产党之缺乏联系是错误而有害的。当此战后国际形势更趋复杂之际，各共产党间交换经验与配合行动的需要特别迫切，各国共产党缺乏联系将损害工人阶级。鉴于上述种种，与会者获得如下协定：（一）设立一联络局，由南斯拉夫共产党、保加利亚工人党（共产党）、罗马尼亚共产党、匈牙利共产党、波兰工人党、苏联共产党（布）、法国共产党、捷克共产党、意大利共产党等代表组成之。（二）联络局任务为组织交换经验，且于必要时在互相同意的基础上配合各共产党的活动。（三）联络局由各党中央委员会代表二人组成之，各代表由各党中央委员会任命与更换。（四）联络局应出版一机关刊物，初为半月刊，然后改为周刊，以法文与俄文印行，可能时得应用他种文字。（五）联络局设于贝尔格莱德城。
