Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th—According to news from the Chiang-controlled areas: Chiang bandits have recently intensified their grain robbery and conscription in the areas they control. Since September, the Jiangsu Chiang bandit provincial government has ordered various counties to plunder large quantities of military grain in addition to the "official quota" of land tax. Wujin County alone has "purchased" and "borrowed" 45,200 stones of rice. Their extortion extends to farmers and people of all professions. Since September 13, Jiangyin has been "preparing" 20,000 stones of land tax, with farmers in various townships bearing 17,000 stones, and the remainder borne by merchants. The county government also issued an order: "Those who delay will be punished for delaying military grain." Taiyuan, Shanxi, recently stipulated that military grain be plundered based on house rent. That is, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, each room was taxed one yuan, which could buy 20 catties of white flour at that time. Now, grain is demanded according to this standard. According to Pan Hejing, a captured Chiang family councilor from Songtao County, Guizhou, in Yangshanji, Luxi, his son-in-law, Yang Shan, earns 83 stones of grain annually, but is forced to hand over 73 stones as military grain, accounting for more than 87 percent of his income.

　　蒋匪图作垂死挣扎  抢粮抓丁变本加厉
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据蒋区消息：蒋匪在统治区抢粮抓丁最近愈紧急。江苏蒋匪省政府九月以来令各县在“正额”田赋以外大量掠夺军粮，武进一县即“征购”与“筹借”稻谷四万五千二百石，其搜刮遍及农民与各种职业人民。江阴自九月十三日起，“预备”田赋两万石，各乡镇农民负担一万七千石，余由商人负担。该县政府并传令：“如有延误，以贻误军粮论罪”。山西太原近规定按房捐掠取军粮，即抗战前每间房捐一元，当时可买白面二十斤，现即按此索粮。另据鲁西羊山集被俘之贵州松桃县蒋家参议员潘和靖近称：其女婿杨山每年收入粮食八十三石，被勒缴军粮却达七十三石，占收入百分之八十七以上。
