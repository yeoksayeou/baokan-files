    [Reported by this newspaper from the Jiluyu area, 26th] Dianzi Village in Hexi County (newly established county, formerly west of the Yellow River in Changqing County) of the Sixth District has solved four basic problems in mutual aid, forming a surge in autumn harvesting and wheat planting. First, cadres take the lead and personally lead. Village cadres all have a spirit of setting an example, working hard and being responsible, and there is absolutely no selfishness. When distributing work, the cadres run to the front. Everyone discusses which piece of land should be planted or harvested, and allocates it according to the actual situation. If something happens in the group, they examine and discuss it. The village cadres call in the morning, and they go to the fields before dawn; second, the division of labor is scientific and clear, the strength is concentrated, and the command is unified. Cadres lead separately, mobilize all the strength of the village, and select male and female group leaders. The large group is further divided into several small groups. The work is done by the large group. Every night, they examine the plan, and the small groups divide the work according to their personal strengths and with everyone's consent. They specialize in what they are good at; third, grasp the principle of not suffering losses. In the mutual aid, properly and carefully record the work (such as full work, half work, rewards and punishments, etc.). If the plough and harrow tools are damaged, everyone is jointly responsible for repairing them. If the cattle are thin after the wheat is planted in autumn, and money is lost, subsidies will be given according to the situation. This eliminates production concerns in mutual aid; fourth, select models and establish merits. Whoever has outstanding achievements and creations will be praised and rewarded. Here, the mutual aid group selected four tilling models: Wang Xuhe, Wang Chengliang, Ding Shaochun, and Ding Shaoming, advocating deep ploughing and careful cultivation; selected the driving model Wang Xuming, who pulled more and faster, improving driving skills; and selected four female models: the wife of Ding Zheng Lun, the wife of Ding Jingzhen, the wife of Wang Chengmin, and the wife of Ding Shaotian, because they worked on time and did not waste a single grain. After these models were selected, they went to the fields with model signs, so everyone worked actively.
    [Reported by this newspaper from the Jiluyu area, 26th] After the autumn harvest and wheat planting season came, the male and female farmers in Qiankou Village, the second district of Nanle, turned the resolutions of the meeting, such as "determined to work hard for production" and "strive to plant more wheat," into practical actions. Now the mutual aid groups in the village are actively competing with each other. The characteristic of Ma Wenxing's mutual aid group is unity. This is because although the group leader Ma Wenxing is already sixty-one years old, he has always been at the forefront when working, and he cares for every family very much. Therefore, the group members are embarrassed to ask for leave when they are sick. "People are so old and still working happily, what is our sickness!" The group has a total of 189 mu of land and plans to plant 160 mu of wheat. It has now planted 140 mu, and the entire plan will be completed in a day or two. The characteristic of Yan Chunyue's group is that the work is recorded clearly and reasonably, especially the care for those who are on duty is even better. Therefore, the group has been full of enthusiasm since its establishment after last year's wheat harvest, and everyone is striving to work. Liang Shucheng's group has more women than men, with seven male laborers and eight female laborers. These eight female laborers not only activated their own group, but also influenced the women in other groups. They formed two stone rolling groups, which can roll about 23 mu of land every day. For this reason, many women were not convinced. The young woman Wu Xu showed her skills that she had never shown before, shaking the seed drill as skillfully as a man. The woman Wang Sibang helped with the seed drill, and could plant 23 mu of wheat every day. Others, such as Ma Dao San, were relatively silent in the past, but in this seasonal production, they were also activated by everyone's influence.

    店子提高互助
    收种人人带劲
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】六分区河西县（新设县，原长清县黄河西岸）店子村解决了互助中的四个基本问题，秋收种麦形成热潮。第一是干部带头，亲自领导。村干都有以身作则苦心负责的精神，绝没有自私，在分配作活的时候，干部跑到头里那块地该种该收割大伙商量，并按实际情况分配。组里有事就检讨，就商量，早晨由村干叫，天不明就下地；第二是分工科学明确，力量集中，指挥统一，干部分头领导，把全村所有力量动员起来，选出男女组长来，在大组里还另分成若干小组，做活是以大组为单位，每晚检讨计划，小组分工根据个人的擅长，征求大家的同意，干么专门就干么；第三是掌握不吃亏的原则，在互助当中适当的、认真的记起工来（如整工半工，奖惩等），毁了犁、耙工具，大家共同负责修理，如秋后把麦子种完，牛使瘦了，赔了钱，到时根据情况予以补助。这样解除了互助中生产顾虑；第四是选模立功，谁有突出的成绩和创造，就表扬他、奖励他。这里互助组选出了耕地模范王绪河、王承亮、丁少春、丁少明四人，提倡了深耕细作；选出了驶车模范王绪明，拉的多拉的快，提高了驶车技术；选出了妇女模范丁整伦之妻、丁敬珍之妻、王承敏之妻、丁绍田之妻四人，因为作活不头不猾按时下地，不丢一粒粮食。这样选出模范后，下地都带上了模范牌，所以大家都积极的干起来了。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】秋收种麦的生产季节来到以后，南乐二区千口村的男女农民，都把会上“决心努力生产”，“争取多种麦”等决议，变成了实际行动，现该村各互助组，正活跃的互相竞赛着。马文兴互助组的特点是心齐，这是由于组长马文兴虽然已六十一岁，但劳动时向来都在前头，对每家都是爱护倍至，因此该组的组员有了病，都不好意思请假，人家那么大年纪，还干的欢，咱有点病算啥！”该组共有地一百八十九亩，计划种一百六十亩麦子，现已种上一百四十亩，再过一两天便可完成全部计划。阎春岳组的特点是，记工记的清又合理，特别对出战勤人的照顾更好，因此该组从去年麦后成立到现在，一向是情绪饱满的，个个争先干活。梁书成组妇女多过男人，有七个男劳力，八个女劳力，这八个女劳力不但活跃了本组，还影响其他组的妇女，她们八个组成了两个拉砘子组，每天能拉二十三亩左右的地，为此，许多妇女不服气，青年妇女吴需，拿出从来没有显过的本领，象男人一样熟练的摇着耧，妇女王思帮耧，每天能耩二十三亩麦。其他如马道三等，过去是比较沉寂的，但在这次季节性的生产中，也都被大家影响的活跃起来。
