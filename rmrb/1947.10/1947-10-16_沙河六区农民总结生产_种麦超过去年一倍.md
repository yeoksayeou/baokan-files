　　Farmers in the Sixth District of Shahe Sum Up Production
  　Wheat Planting More Than Doubled Compared to Last Year
    [Report from this newspaper, Shahe] By around October 8th, all 50,000 mu of wheat fields in the villages of the Sixth District had been sown. Encouraged by the Great Emulation Movement and the victory of the Great Counter-Offensive, the speed of this year's autumn harvest and wheat planting surpassed any previous year. To summarize the competition and the production achievements of the entire district for the whole year, a conference of production activists and labor hero model figures from various villages was specially convened on October 9th. The number of attendees was 775, with poor and hired peasants accounting for 77%, and the rest being middle and lower-middle peasants. The masses in various villages were all gathered on the streets watching current affairs and production exhibition charts, as well as the large map of our army's counter-offensive victories. At the beginning of the conference, the chairman first reported the news of our army's counter-offensive victories on various fronts, and then reported the annual production achievements, saying: "In the past year, we have also fought several major battles on the production front. This is mainly the result of us being liberated, having land, and organizing ourselves to engage in large-scale production. The total area of land in the district is 74,000 mu. The first victory this year was planting 240 mu of indigo, which sold for 100,000 yuan per mu, and the entire district can exchange it for 960 shi of grain (25,000 yuan per shi of millet); the second victory was planting 15,000 mu of buckwheat (including more than 2,400 mu of reclaimed wasteland, and some vegetables included); the third victory was that we organized ourselves to fight day and night, eliminating 17,000 mu of pests, and preserving the grain that was about to reach our mouths; the fourth victory was even greater. Last year, the entire district only planted more than 20,000 mu of wheat, but this year we planted 50,000 mu. Not only did we plant more this year, but we also planted faster and earlier. Because of good organization, we all planted the wheat in a timely manner (last year we were still planting at the beginning of the Beginning of Winter), saving at least half a sheng of wheat seeds per mu, and the entire district saved 250 shi of wheat seeds. If each mu yields one dou more next year, the entire district can harvest an additional 5,000 shi. Everyone can see how great our production achievements are this year! The reason why we have achieved so much this year is because we listened to the words of the Communist Party, and more importantly, it is due to the active leadership of our group, especially the majority of poor and hired peasants who have played a leading backbone role in various tasks. Finally, we must thoroughly investigate the production achievements of each household and each village, calculate our assets, compare our time, and see how great our victory is in production." Then, they were divided into groups for discussion, and everyone, group, and village is now calculating assets, comparing time, and summarizing the annual production achievements.
