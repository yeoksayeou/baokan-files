Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liao, 25th. The Mongol and Han soldiers and civilians who persisted in the guerrilla war in Shangdu, Dehua and Inner Mongolia in northern Chahar, recently crushed the so-called "destructive sweep" of Fu Zuoyi's bandit troops in the area for three consecutive months, liberating the vast grassland area of 40,000 Mongol and Han people. Since June, Fu's bandits Sun Lanfeng, E You-san, and Mongolian traitors Renqin Daorji, Zhong Nai Xie Li and other troops of 5,000 people, with more than 100 cars, have frantically roamed the area, carrying out massacres and plunder. Our Mongol and Han people fought side by side with Mongol and Han cavalry, launching a heroic anti-"sweep" war. In extremely difficult circumstances, marching day and night, camping every night, they finally shattered Fu's bandits' attempt and defeated the fleeing bandits, winning victory. Our Mongol and Han cavalry, after a tense march of two days and one night, annihilated a unit of Mongolian bandits of 50 in Sanmianjing and Taibus Temple, defeated Zhong Nai Xie Li's bandit troops, captured Zhong Nai Xie Li and other bandit leaders five people, and were executed by the Mongol compatriots in a public trial. Another unit of our Chahar North Liberation Army also rushed to aid from afar, and cooperated with the local cavalry to fight, winning more than ten battles, large and small, in Bernaimiao, Wulan, etc., defeating E You-san's bandit troops, completely annihilating the remnants of Zhong Nai Xie Li, and the Xianghuangqi pseudo-First District Office and the pseudo-major township armed forces of Yugou Liangzi (20 miles south of Huade). Not only was the area recovered, but also the work on the border between Chahar and Sui was developed. At the moment, the area has restored the four banner governments of Shangdu, East and West Sunite, and Xianghuang, 32 Sumu (ie districts), and a vast area of hundreds of miles in length and breadth of more than 60 villages belonging to Shangdu and Huade. Fu's bandits only occupy four isolated strongholds: Shangdu, Huade, Tumuerte, and Gehuasitai. In the anti-"sweep," only a certain unit of the local Inner Mongolia Self-Defense Army fought 16 battles, killing and wounding 201 bandits below the company commander, capturing 194, and seizing 220 long and short guns.
