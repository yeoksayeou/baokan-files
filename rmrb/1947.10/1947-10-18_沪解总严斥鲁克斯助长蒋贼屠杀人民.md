　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 14th, Lin Zhong, Acting Director of the Shanghai Office of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) General Headquarters, issued a statement sternly condemning the unreasonable pro-Chiang Kai-shek attitude displayed by Rooks, the newly arrived Director-General of UNRRA, in handling relief affairs in China. At a recent meeting in Shanghai, Rooks openly abandoned the UNRRA relief policy, expressing "sympathy" for the Chiang Kai-shek government's unwillingness to "send relief supplies into the hands of the government's (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) enemies (referring to the Liberated Areas)," and declared that UNRRA "cannot force the Nationalist government to comply with UNRRA obligations." Regarding the issue of releasing relief ships bound for the Liberated Areas raised by the UNRRA representative, Rooks adopted a perfunctory attitude, saying that if the Nationalist Party "does not agree to the release," he "can only submit this issue to the UNRRA Central Committee." Lin Zhong pointed out that Rooks' attitude at the meeting was a confession, indicating that he never intended to protect UNRRA's "position as a neutral international relief organization" in China. He pointed out that Rooks' "sympathy" for the Nationalist Party's military objectives "is the main reason why UNRRA cannot implement its policies." Lin said: UNRRA and the Nationalist government have already committed "enormous crimes" against the people in the Liberated Areas, and pointed out that UNRRA should be held responsible for failing to fairly distribute relief supplies.
    In other news, Rooks arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 13th, where Chiang Kai-shek personally greeted him and flattered Rooks to the extreme, presenting him with the so-called "First Class Medal of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon," which was personally pinned on by Song Meiling to express "gratitude" for UNRRA's one-sided assistance to Chiang Kai-shek over the past two years. Rooks returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 15th and will soon leave China for the United States.

　　沪解总严斥鲁克斯助长蒋贼屠杀人民
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据美联社上海十四日电，解总驻沪办事处代理处长林仲发表谈话，严斥最近来华之联总署长鲁克斯在处理对华救济事务中，所表现的无理袒护蒋介石态度。鲁克斯在最近于上海举行的一次会议中，竟公然背弃联总救济方针，对蒋介石政府不愿将救济物资“送入政府（指蒋介石）敌人（指解放区）手中”一点，竟表示“同情”，并声言联总“不能迫使国民党政府遵守联总义务。”对解总代表所提出之运往解放区的救济船只的放行问题，鲁氏则持敷衍态度，谓如国民党“不同意放行”，他“只能将此问题提交联总中央委员会。”林仲指出鲁克斯在会议中之态度为一种自白，说明他从未打算保护联总在华“做为一个中立的国际救济机关的立场。”指出鲁克斯对于国民党军事目的之“同情”，“就是联总不能实行其政策的主要原因”。林氏说：联总与国民党政府对解放区人民已做了“极大的罪恶”，指出联总应对未能公平分配救济物资负责。
    另息，鲁克斯于十三日晨由沪转抵南京，蒋贼亲予招待，对鲁氏极尽韶媚，并献呈所谓“一等景星大绶勋章，”由宋美龄亲为挂上，以表对联总两年多来片面援助蒋贼之“铭谢”。鲁已于十五日由京返沪，不日离华返美。
