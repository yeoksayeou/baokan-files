Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 10th: According to various sources: As the powerful autumn offensive of the Northeast People's Liberation Army continues to expand, Changchun, where the sound of cannons has already been heard, has been under curfew day and night, and the entire city is in a state of terror. Chiang bandit troops, huddled in defensive fortifications, are randomly shooting and killing innocent civilians. After Chiang Kai-shek flew to Shenyang on the 8th, Shenyang has established four outer defense lines. A curfew is in effect from 8 p.m., and the "curfew order" stipulates that Chiang bandit troops will shoot and kill people who enter the cordon at night; citizens are forced to organize so-called "emergency teams" to prepare for "street fighting." Chiang bandit officials in Shenyang, who usually appear as conquerors and commit all kinds of evil, "their panic has developed into a stage of vying to board planes to leave this threatened city," (Reuters). Chen Cheng, the head of the civil war bandits, has also announced that he is "indisposed" (Reuters). Shocked by the offensive launched by the People's Liberation Army along the Beining Railway, Chiang bandit troops in Tianjin have "laid mines" around the urban area (Associated Press). Under the shock of the great counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army in the south, the Chiang family bandit gang in Hunan, south of the Yangtze River, is also digging wells only when thirsty and holding so-called "provincial security meetings," preparing to force the people to "guarantee one person with one gun" and organize county "self-defense forces," in a panic and chaotic mess.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 9th: As the powerful autumn offensive of the Northeast People's Liberation Army is in full swing, civil war instigator Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly flew from Beiping to Shenyang at 12:30 p.m. on the 8th. According to Agence France-Presse, his purpose was to "give Chen Cheng final instructions" on the eve of the so-called "decisive battle on the outskirts of Shenyang." However, Chiang Kai-shek did not dare to stay in Shenyang for long, staying for only four hours, and fled back to Beiping in the afternoon of the 8th. According to Agence France-Presse, quoting a "neutral observer" in Nanjing, "The Manchurian (Chiang) army is almost in a hopeless situation because railway traffic between major cities has been cut off." According to a Central News Agency report: Fu Zuoyi, who was ordered by Chiang Kai-shek on the 7th to go to Shenyang to discuss the Northeast "military" issue, also returned to Beiping with Chiang Kai-shek.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 8th: According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Beiping on the 7th: Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly flew to Beiping on the 4th and held an "important military meeting" to deal with the critical situation of Chiang bandit troops in Northeast and North China. The Associated Press revealed that Chiang Kai-shek was extremely panicked by the powerful offensive of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. Well-informed sources declared: "It is believed that Chiang Kai-shek will personally preside over the establishment of a headquarters in Beiping to deal with the upcoming battle of Shenyang" ... "The war command center of the (Chiang) government for maintaining a foothold in the Northeast has now had to retreat to Beiping." It was even said that Chiang had drafted a plan to "defend" Beiping and would replace "some senior North China officials." At the same time, according to the Associated Press: Since Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Beiping, "political figures have been living in unease and panic. The Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (secret service) is busy with activities, especially after nightfall. After the arrival of Zheng Jiemin, the director of the bureau, arrests have accelerated." The Associated Press reported that Chiang Kai-shek is fabricating charges to massacre non-direct line military officers. After Chiang arrived in Beiping, he spread rumors that certain groups were brewing a "secession movement" and "plotting to overthrow the Nanjing government." More than ten important figures under Sun Lianzhong, a general of the old Northwest Army Feng Yuxiang faction, and Li Zongren, the head of the Gui faction, have been arrested. Many others on the blacklist have "gone into hiding." Chiang Kai-shek held "talks" with Li Zongren and Sun Lianzhong all day on the 6th. It is believed that the terror will continue to develop.

　　图谋应付军事危局蒋介石跄踉平沈间
    【新华社陕北十日电】据各方消息：在东北人民解放军强大秋季攻势继续扩展之际，已闻炮声之长春已日夜戒严，全城陷入恐怖状态，龟缩防御工事中之蒋匪胡乱开枪射杀无辜市民。蒋贼八日一度飞沈之后，沈阳已设立四道外围防线，入夜八时起即戒严，“戒严令”规定，夜间进入警戒线之人民，蒋匪即予开枪射杀；市民被强迫组织所谓“救急队”准备“巷战”。平时以征服者姿态出现无恶不作之沈阳蒋匪官员，“恐慌已发展为争相搭机离此受威胁的城市之阶段”，内战匪首阵诚亦宣布“政躬违和”了（路透社）。为解放军沿北宁路进行之攻势所震骇，天津蒋匪已在市区周围“布雷”（合众社）。在南线解放军大反攻震慑之下，长江以南的湖南，蒋家匪帮亦临渴掘井召开所谓“全省治安会议”，准备强迫人民“一保一人一枪”，组织各县“自卫队”，手忙脚乱慌作一团。
    【新华社陕北九日电】当东北人民解放军强大秋季攻势如火如荼之际，内战祸首蒋介石于八日午十二时半由北平仓惶飞抵沈阳，其目的据法新社说是在所谓“沈阳外围决战”的前夜，“予陈诚以最后的指示。”但蒋贼在沈阳未敢久停，仅留住四小时，于八日下午即窜返北平。据法新社引南京“中立观察家”之言称：“满洲国（蒋）军几处于无望之局势中，因各大城市间之铁路交通已经断绝。”据中央社息：于七日奉蒋贼命令赴沈阳商讨东北“军事”问题之傅作义，亦与蒋同返北平。
    【新华社陕北八日电】据法新社北平七日电息：蒋介石于四日匆忙飞抵北平后，曾举行一“重要的军事会议”，以应付蒋匪在东北及华北的危急局势。美联社透露，蒋介石对东北民主联军之强大攻势已极为慌张，消息灵通人士宣称：“相信蒋介石将亲自主持成立北平总部以应付即将到来的沈阳之战”……（蒋）政府在东北保持一个立足点的战争指挥中心，现已不得不退至北平。”甚至说：蒋已拟定“保卫”北平的计划，将撤换“若干华北高级官员。”同时，据美联社称：自蒋介石抵平后，“政界人士都在不安与恐慌中过活。调查统计局（特务机关）正在忙于活动，特别是在夜幕降临之后。该局局长郑介民来平之后，逮捕就加速进行起来。”美联社的消息显示，蒋介石正在制造屠杀非其嫡系之武官之罪名，蒋抵平后，散布出所谓某些集团正在酝酿“分离运动”，“图谋推翻南京政府”等项谣言，老西北军冯玉祥系将领孙连仲及桂系首领李宗仁手下重要人员已有十人以上被捕。另有许多被列入黑名单的人，则“已藏匿起来了”，蒋介石于六日曾整日与李宗仁及孙连仲举行“会谈”。咸信恐怖还将继续发展。
