　　Soviet Union invents new welding machine
  　Productivity increases tenfold
  　Stronger than American-made by four times
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th】Moscow News: Soviet Academician, Socialist Labor Hero, Paton, and a group of scientists and engineers under his leadership, recently invented a new type of automatic welding machine, causing a revolution in several industrial sectors in the Soviet Union. Not long ago, the Soviet trade representative requested an American company to purchase an automatic welding machine for thin-walled metal tubes (with a productivity of 42 meters per hour), but was unreasonably rejected by the company. Paton then decided to invent his own. After a short period of design, they created their own automatic welding machine, whose productivity is four times stronger than the American-made one. The Soviet Council of Ministers issued a circular to all industrial sectors to use this Paton-style welding machine in large quantities, resulting in a revolution in many industries, with some industrial sectors increasing their productivity tenfold as a result. For example, when welding 40.5@ metal plates with the automatic machine, it is 40 times faster than manual welding.

　　苏联发明新型熔接器
  　生产力增十倍
  　比美国造的强达四倍
    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科讯：苏联大学士，社会主义劳动英雄巴顿及其领导下的一批科学家与工程师最近发明一种新型自动熔接器，在苏联若干工业部门中引起革命。不久以前，苏联商务代表曾向美国某公司要求购买一种薄壁金属管的自动熔接器（具有每小时四十二米突的生产力）而遭该公司无理拒绝。巴顿遂决意自行发明，经过短期设计之后，他们造成了自己的自动熔接器，其生产力比美造者强达四倍之多。苏联部长会议通令各工业部门大量使用这种巴顿式熔接机，结果造成许多工业的革命，有的工业部门生产力竟因此提高十倍。例如用自动机熔接四十点五＠的金属板时，即较人工快四十倍。
