　　Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 23rd: The People's Liberation Army successively captured the three county towns of Yingshan, Guangji, and Wangjiang. On the 20th, a certain unit of our army active in western Anhui captured Wangjiang County for the first time. On the same day, another unit recaptured Yingshan County. The battle results are still being verified. In addition, a certain unit of our army recovered Guangji County on the 21st. The defending enemy fled southwest as our army approached. Order in the city is being restored. It should be noted that Yingshan and Guangji were recovered by our army in the first and middle ten days of September, and then we took the initiative to transfer operations, and were reoccupied by the Chiang bandits. This is the second recovery for both.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 23rd: Local armed forces in the first and ninth sub-districts of Central Jiangsu wiped out more than 300 enemies and recovered five strongholds. On the evening of the 13th, the local armed forces of the ninth sub-district launched an attack on the Liu (Qiao) Shi (Gang) line between Nantong and Rugao, and by the 14th, they captured four strongholds including Taiping Bridge, Hetan, Huashi Street, and Taichang, annihilating and capturing 168 members of the Jiang-controlled Liuqiao District security team and the "anti-traitor team." On the 19th, the local armed forces of the first sub-district captured Dasizhuang, an important stronghold on the left side of the Changjiangbiankou (shore) Tai (Zhou) line, killing and capturing more than 100 local bandits. Furthermore, on the 18th, the Jingjiang County local armed forces wiped out two Chiang-controlled county security platoons, totaling more than 100 men, in Shijiadai.
