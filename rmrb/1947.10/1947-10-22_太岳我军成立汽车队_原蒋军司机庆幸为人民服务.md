　　Taiyue Our Army Establishes Motor Vehicle Team
  　Former Chiang Army Drivers Rejoice to Serve the People
    [This newspaper Taiyue 20th dispatch] The Chiang bandit motor vehicle team captured by Chen-Xie's army in the Lingbao and Shanzhou battles has now safely arrived in a certain area of Taiyue and formally established a motor vehicle team to serve the Taiyue People's Liberation Army. When our army attacked Lingbao and Shanzhou, Chiang bandit officers attempted to destroy these vehicles, but were refused by these drivers. After the liberation, they immediately assisted the People's Liberation Army with their technical skills, taking out the buried parts one by one, so that the vehicles could be started and used to transport all the military supplies seized in the battle for the People's Army. Guo Entai, a 62-year-old auto worker who has served Chiang Kai-shek for more than ten years, was not valued because of his age, but now he is working very hard. He said, "In Chiang Kai-shek's place, I lived a subhuman life. Now I am not a prisoner of war, but have returned to my hometown to work for the people. This is much happier!" They are all working very hard and also studying diligently.

　　太岳我军成立汽车队
  　原蒋军司机庆幸为人民服务
    【本报太岳二十日电】陈谢大军在灵宝、陕州战役中缴获之蒋匪汽车队，现已安全开至太岳某地，正式成立汽车队，随太岳人民解放军服务。在我军攻击灵宝、陕州时，蒋匪军官曾企图炸毁这些汽车，但被这些驾驶员设法拒绝了，并在解放后，立即以技术协助人民解放军，把埋藏了的零件一一取了出来，一辆一辆汽车，便能开动起来了，开始给人民军队运输在战役中缴获的一切军用物资。六十二岁的老汽车工人郭恩泰，为蒋匪已服务十多年，因年老不被重用，而现在他干的很有劲，他说：“在蒋介石那里，过着不是人的生活，现在我不是被俘虏，而是回到了老家，为人民干事情，这快活多了！”他们都干的很有劲，还努力学习。
