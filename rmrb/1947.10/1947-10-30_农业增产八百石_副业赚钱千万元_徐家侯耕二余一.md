　　Increasing Agricultural Production by Eight Hundred Shi
    Sideline Business Earning Ten Million Yuan
    Xu Family's Hou Achieves "Cultivate Two, Surplus One"
    [Report from Hukuan by Our Newspaper] Under the leadership of model cadre Xu Yueshun and Li Mingze, the top labor hero in the county, the masses of Xujiahou Village in the Third District, with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, carried out a year of production campaign, creating the "three-way combination" experience of agricultural, sideline, and wartime support variable work, achieving brilliant results. The village has a total of 1,566 mu, eight fen, and nine li of land, with a population of 819, averaging 1 mu, nine fen, and one li, three hao of land per person. The land quality is also very poor, mostly mountainous, with an average grain yield of 1 shi and 4 dou and 2 sheng per mu. This year's actual grain harvest was 3,073 shi, seven dou, and six sheng, with an average actual grain yield of 1 shi and 9 dou and 6 sheng per mu, an average increase of 5 dou and 4 sheng per mu, for a total increase of 848 shi, seven dou, and eight sheng. In terms of sideline businesses, the village has 196 female spinners who spun a total of 8,630 jin and four liang of cotton throughout the year, and 54 female weavers and 6 boy workers who, combined with agriculture and unified dividend distribution, continuously wove 6,672 jin and eight liang of cloth throughout the year. The profit from spinning and weaving was 9,572,980 yuan. With the combination of agricultural and sideline variable work, the village's 12 donkeys continuously carried out transportation throughout the year. The village had 5 variable work teams, 5 small cooperatives, 4 mills, 1 flour mill, 1 carpentry shop, 19 pigs, 125 sheep, and 104 chickens. In seven and a half months, including spinning and weaving, a total of 12,924,480 yuan was earned, buying back 147 shi and 2 dou and 3 sheng of grain, with the remainder used for clothing, paying fees, small expenses, and joining shares. Excluding the 73 people working, serving in the army, doing business, or studying elsewhere, the actual expenditure for 746 people at home, calculated at 3 shi of grain per person, was 2,238 shi of grain for the whole year, leaving a surplus of 982 shi and 9 dou and 9 sheng of grain. The surplus grain is enough for the whole village to eat for five months and three days. The money earned from sideline businesses (excluding the 147 shi and 2 dou and 3 sheng of grain) was not calculated in terms of grain (because the masses who did not actually buy grain were not counted). Adding the sideline production for the next four and a half months, it can exceed "cultivate two, surplus one." Why could such a poor village achieve such results this year? The main conditions and reasons are as follows: First, they grasped the production policy of focusing on agriculture, combined with sideline businesses throughout the year. In the spring, because sideline businesses earned money and Xujiahou's land was narrow, averaging 1 mu and 9 fen of land per person, the grain produced was not enough to eat, so some people developed the idea of valuing sideline businesses over agriculture. At that time, they overcame the idea of neglecting agriculture by recalling the disasters and clarifying that grain is the foundation of prices, and the general rule is that when grain is expensive, everything rises, and when grain is cheap, everything falls. After summer planting, the disaster struck, which further proved that the above principle was correct. As a result, they deepened deep plowing and meticulous cultivation with more fertilizer, applying an average of 102 dan of base fertilizer per mu of autumn land, and an average of 45 dan of topdressing fertilizer per mu of corn land, ensuring increased production. They promoted the superior variety "Golden Queen" on 256 mu, harvesting a total of 583 shi and 4 dou and 6 sheng, an average increase of 3 shi and 9 dou per mu compared to local corn, for a total increase of 99 shi and 8 dou and 4 sheng. At the same time, they also seized the opportunity to engage in sideline production, especially spinning and weaving, which solved all the expenses throughout the year and exchanged for more than 100 shi of grain. Sideline income accounted for 34.5% of the village's total income, and actual grain purchases accounted for only 4.76% of agricultural grain income, mostly for clothing, paying public funds, buying farm tools, and eating oil and salt. Therefore, the main reliance of "cultivate two, surplus one" is agriculture, but sideline businesses must be engaged in, especially spinning and weaving, which solves the problem of clothing and expenses. There were absolutely no grain expenses, so the masses said: "Agriculture guarantees grain, leaving surplus grain after eating; sideline businesses guarantee all expenses and clothes." Second, after liberation, enthusiasm was high, and the experience of the "three-way combination" of agricultural, sideline, and wartime support in organization was created. After the masses were liberated and had land, they lacked foundation and savings, and there were difficulties in production. They also had to carry out the patriotic self-defense war to eradicate the old roots. Under the conditions of labor shortage and heavy tasks, they gave play to the wisdom of the newly liberated masses and created a village-wide organization based on agricultural mutual aid teams, unifying work calculation, converting work, and distributing dividends. They unified all the village's labor, according to labor strength, living burden, and technical level, with agricultural work as the standard, using uniform work tickets. The profits earned were turned over to small cooperatives and variable work teams, and accounts were settled and dividends were distributed monthly. Agricultural work was calculated at five xiang, carpentry at seven xiang, which everyone was willing to and actively participated in. Whoever worked for someone earned work tickets, and carpenters and sideline workers paid dividends and received work tickets, distributing dividends monthly according to the number of work tickets, greatly stimulating everyone's enthusiasm for production. Everyone actively produced in order to earn work tickets, and agricultural and sideline mutual aid played a promoting role. In rectifying mutual aid, the cleaning up of legacy issues not only completely cleared the wage accounts, but also solved the problems of previous years, clearing obstacles for the road to organization. Third, the poor and hired peasants are the backbone, and the more they work, the happier they are. This year, the production leaders and activists of Majiahou are all poor and hired newly liberated masses, so their enthusiasm is getting higher and higher. Over the past year, the masses have intensified their cultivation after obtaining land. As Xiao Hei said, "In the past, we had never planted such a large piece of land. Now that we have land, we are happy to see it and don't know how to do it well." He sowed early this spring, completed it ahead of schedule, applied more manure, and caught the seedlings. Until the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, they increased grain production, and everyone was even happier. As Bao Zhen said, "In the past, we couldn't harvest so much grain! This year is really good! We didn't prepare any equipment at home, and we can't put it down." Therefore, everyone, upon hearing the wind, was afraid of damaging the crops and harvested overnight. While harvesting, they plowed, and the more they worked, the higher their enthusiasm. They plan to complete the land preparation before the fifteenth day of the ninth lunar month and prepare one-third of the fertilizer to be sent to the land, averaging 100 dan per mu, which has now been prepared, and strive to earn 500,000 yuan per team in sideline businesses before the fifteenth day of the tenth month, laying a good foundation for this winter's production.

　　农业增产八百石
    副业赚钱千万元
    徐家侯耕二余一
    【本报壶关讯】三区徐家侯村在模范干部徐月顺与全县头等劳英李明则领导下，全村群众以贫雇为骨气进行了一年生产运动，创造了农副业战勤的三大结合变工经验，获得了辉煌成绩。全村共有土地一千五百六十六亩八分九厘，有人八百一十九口，每人平均一亩九分一厘三土地，土地质量又很差，大都是山地，每亩平均产粮一石四斗二，今年实收粮食三千零七十三石七斗六，每亩平均实产粮一石九斗六，平均每亩增产了五斗四升，共增产粮食八百四十八石七斗八。在副业上，全村一百九十六个纺妇，全年纺花八千六百三十斤零四两，五十四个织妇，六个男孩工人，与农业结合统一分红，全年不停织布六千六百七十二斤八两，纺织获利九百五十七万二千九百八十元、农副业结合大变工，全村十二头毛驴，全年不停的进行运输，全村五个变工队，五个小型合作社，四个磨坊，一座粉坊，一座木铺，养猪十九只，羊一百二十五只，鸡一百零四只，七个半月连纺织共赚了一千二百九十二万四千四百八十元，买回粮食一百四十七石二斗三，其余用于穿布、交款、零化、并入了股金。全村除了在外工作参军经商住学者七十三人外，实在家开支者七百四十六人，每人以食粮三石计，全年吃粮二千二百三十八石，剩余粮九百八十二石九斗九，所余之粮还够全村吃五个月零三天，副业所赚之钱（除一百四十七石二斗三升粮食外）未折粮计算（因实际群众未买粮的就未计），加上今后四个半月的副业生产，可超过耕二余一。为什么这样的穷村，今年能达到这样的成绩呢？主要的有以下几个条件与原因：一、掌握了农业为主，结合副业贯澈全年的生产方针。春天由于副业赚钱，与徐家侯的土地窄狭原因，每人平均一亩九分地，打的粮食不够吃，所以有部分人产生重副轻农的思想，当时以回忆灾荒和明确粮食是物价的根本，一般的规律是粮食贵百物涨，粮食贱百物跌的解释办法，克服了轻视农业的思想。到夏种后，灾荒袭击，就更证明以上道理是正确的，由于这样，加深了深耕细作多上肥土，每亩秋地平均上底肥一百零二担，玉茭地上追肥每亩平均四十五担，保证了增产。推广金皇后优良品种二百五十六亩，共收粮五百八十三石四斗六升每亩平均比土玉茭增产三石九斗，共增产玉茭九十九石八斗四升。同时也抓紧了搞副业生产，特别是纺织，解决了全年全面的一切开支问题，并换回了粮食一百余石，副业收入占全村总收入百分之卅四点五，实际买粮占农业收入粮食的百分之四点七六，大部是穿布，交公款，买农具，吃油盐等开支了。所以耕二余一的主要依托是农业，但必须搞副业，尤其是纺织，解决了穿布与开支问题，完全没有开支粮食，所以群众说：“农业保证粮食，除吃有余粮，副业保证一切开支与换衣裳。”二、翻身以后情绪高，在组织起来上创造了农副业战勤三大结合的经验。群众翻身以后有了土地，没有底垫，没积蓄，生产上有困难，又要进行爱国自卫战争刨老根，在劳力缺乏任务繁重的条件下，发挥了新翻身群众的智慧，创造了以农业互助组为基础，把全村全面组织起来，统一计工折工分红，把全村劳力，按劳力强弱，生活轻重，技术高低，以农业活为标准，统一工票，所赚的红利，同交小型合作社变工队，按月清帐分红。农业计工是以五晌，木匠顶七晌，大家愿意并积极参加，给谁家做工赚工票，木匠与副业交红利领工票，按月以工票多少分红，大大的激发了大家的生产积极性，人人为了争取工票积极生产，农副业互助起了推动作用。在整顿互助上，创造了清理遗留问题不但工资帐完全清理，并把历年问题解决清，而且清理了思想问题，给组织起来的道路上扫清了障碍。三、贫雇为骨干，越干越高兴。今年马家侯的生产领导骨干和积极分子，都是贫雇新翻身群众，因此情绪是越来越高涨，一年来群众得到土地加紧耕作，如小黑说：“过去咱就没种过大块地，现在有了地，一见地就高兴了，不知该怎样干才好。”今春他就下种早，提前完成，多上了粪土，捉住了青苗。一直到秋收秋耕中增产了粮食，大家就更高兴了。如保贞说：“过去咱可打不上这样多的粮食呀！今年真好呀，打的家里没预备下家伙，放不下了。”因此大家一听起风，怕损了庄稼，连夜收割，一边割，一边耕，情绪越干越高，计划阴历九月十五前完成垡地，并准备三分之一的肥送到地，每亩平均一百担，现已准备好了，并争取十月十五日前副业上每队赚回五十万元，给今年冬季生产打好基础。（志献）
