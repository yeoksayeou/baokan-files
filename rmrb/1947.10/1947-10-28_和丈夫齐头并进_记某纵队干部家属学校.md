    Marching Forward Shoulder to Shoulder with Their Husbands:
    A Record of a Certain Column's Cadre Family School
    Liu Yuhu, Wang Yishu
    Last winter, only the families of cadres from the × Brigade of the × Column were concentrated, and their lives were very scattered. It was not until the New Year (Gregorian calendar) that Section Chief Cheng of the Civil Affairs Section of the × Brigade took charge and concentrated the families of cadres from the entire column in Gaocun, Wu'an. By April of this year, 290 people had been gathered. Among these people, some were middle school students, some were elementary school students of various levels, some were illiterate rural women, and some were comrades with considerable political and cultural levels and rich work experience. According to these people's levels, learning was divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Class A was for those with an education level of higher elementary school or above, Class B was for those with an education level of three years or more of lower elementary school, and Class C was for those with an education level of two years or less of lower elementary school and those who were illiterate. Administrative management was organized into two detachments, four districts, and sixteen classes, from which outstanding individuals were selected to serve as captains and teachers. A school headquarters was also established, under the leadership of the Rear Echelon of the Column. The Rear Echelon appointed Comrade Wang Yishu as the principal, Comrade Zhang Haiyan as the vice-principal, and Comrade Zhang Yiming as the political instructor. With a sound administrative structure for the school, school affairs and academic affairs meetings were held, and the educational policy of transforming thinking and establishing a labor concept was determined, and administrative and educational plans were drafted. Now it has actually become a quite impressive cadre family school!

    In the beginning, some of the family members had quite backward thinking, with a strong "madam" mentality. Some wore powder and oil, some compared the status of their husbands, complaining that "your husband's status is high, my husband's status is low," "your bedding and clothes are good, my bedding and clothes are bad," causing emotional disturbances. Some demanded to go home, some demanded to open other schools, and they were not at ease with learning. In June, when the column was resting near Anyang, the school headquarters announced a vacation for everyone, asking them to go to the front to meet their loved ones. Before they left, the vice-principal gave a lecture: "When you go to the front, your style should be simple, don't put on a madam's airs..." But some people ignored it. The most typical example was ×××, who combed her hair in a Western style and put on powder on the way. She thought that decorating herself beautifully could win her husband's favor, but when she saw her husband, returning from the front lines, covered in dust, busy with meetings and studies all day long, working hard for the people, this caused a ripple of change in her bad thoughts. After returning from the front, she wrote in her diary: "This time I stayed at the front for a few weeks, I didn't help him at all, but added some burden to him. Now that I think about it, I am really ashamed to death! What qualifications do I have to be fed by others?" Others also experienced a similar shift in thinking after returning from the front.

    It wasn't until July 26th that Wu'an had some rain, but if planting was slow, it would not be good to come out. At this juncture, the school suspended classes to help the masses with emergency planting, and put forward the slogan of "people pulling rollers and seeders." They all responded to this call, and everyone was energetic and eager to try!

    Some students said, "This is our first labor test, to see who has a strong labor concept, to see whose thinking has been straightened out, let's cash it in in the fields." In the fields, two people pulled a seeder, and three people pulled a roller. Their whole bodies were covered in sweat, and their clothes were soaked through. In total, they helped the people plant more than seventy mu.

    It was very difficult to get drinking water and firewood in Gaocun, so the Rear Echelon asked them to move to Hecun. Gaocun is fifty or sixty li away from Hecun. The school headquarters estimated that these students had not walked long distances, and some were pregnant, had bound feet, or were sick, so they would need eighty carts. But during this busy farming season, they also had to take care of the people's production, so they first did mobilization work, mobilizing them to strengthen their mass perspective, reduce the burden on the people, march on foot to reduce the need for carts, and carry backpacks of about ten catties. Those with bound feet, pregnant women, and sick people could ride in carts. After the mobilization, those with bound feet and pregnant women all requested not to ride in carts. The night before their departure, they were all so excited that they couldn't sleep. Early in the morning, everyone got up to pack their belongings, pack their backpacks, ate breakfast, and returned to the dormitories of each class to sweep the rooms. They returned the borrowed items, and carried their backpacks to say goodbye to the landlords. The landlords, old and young, male and female, all came out to see them off.

    After they arrived in Hecun, it rained continuously for two days, and crops and weeds grew together. If they didn't quickly weed when the weather cleared, the fields would become desolate. At this time, the school headquarters suspended classes for three days and called on everyone to help the masses weed the fields. Everyone was in high spirits. Team One issued a challenge competition to Team Two, the conditions of the challenge being to guarantee the participation of everyone in the team, and to guarantee that they would not make noise or damage the masses' seedlings in the fields. Team Two bravely accepted the challenge. The students of Teams One and Two scrambled to participate. Those who were not in good health and those who were pregnant also requested to participate, and the captains and instructors could not stop them. But the heads of each team negotiated with the village cadres, but the village cadres were afraid that they would not be able to weed the fields and would damage the crops, so they did not let them help. They had no choice but to repeatedly mobilize their own landlords, saying: "Let's try it, if we can't weed, we won't weed." The landlords couldn't resist their persistence, so they led them to a piece of land covered with weeds as high as their knees and told them to pull and weed together. They worked tirelessly, some weeding and some pulling, and quickly weeded a five-mu plot of land. Not only did they not damage the crops, but they weeded more cleanly than the men. The next day, the village cadres came to each team again and said: "The people are all willing to let you weed." After that, each class was assigned work, and the village cadres called the heads of households in each field, led them to point out the plots of land, and they began to weed, not even going back at noon. They worked with excitement, singing, talking, and laughing, and everyone's mood became higher day by day. In this way, they helped for three days, and not one person said "tired." During these three days, Team One, with 53 people each day, weeded 18 mu for Caojiazhuang and 42 mu for Dujiazhuang; Team Two weeded 58 mu for Houlianzhuang. On the last evening, when they said goodbye to the village cadres and the masses of Dujiazhuang, the cadres said gratefully: "We asked you to eat, but you didn't eat, we offered you things, but you didn't want them, so we will say that you have made a great contribution and report it to the district." There were also masses, old men and women, men and women, talking to each other: "These are the wives of the Eighth Route Army, they participate in all kinds of labor. The wives of Chiang Kai-shek's army, not to mention participating in labor, don't even move a finger to take a bath." "These wives of the Eighth Route Army are helping us weed the fields. If it were the Central Army, we wouldn't even be able to keep up with their conversations."

    Every day after dinner, there were three hours of production time. The whole school had a total of sixty spinning wheels, and every two people shared one spinning wheel. Each person spun cotton for one and a half hours. When it was time for production, the whole team would gather together, some spinning cotton and singing songs, and some spinning cotton and reviewing their cultural lessons. The whole school was studying very hard, with competitions between teams, competitions between classes, and competitions between people. There were weekly tests and monthly tests, and every student was studying seriously. The students with low cultural levels worked even harder. Li Gaimei had a low level of education, and during breaks, she secretly found a room to study. There was also Liu Yanfeng, who guaranteed to recognize five new characters every day. Li Yang can be considered as someone who added oil on top of oil. She couldn't write letters. This time, her husband sent a letter from the front saying: "Next time, I want you to write the letter yourself." After she received this letter, she remembered it and studied writing letters every day.

    和丈夫齐头并进
    记某纵队干部家属学校
    刘昱乎  王一书
    去年冬天，×纵队只有×旅干部的家属们集中着，生活很散漫。至阳历年，才由×旅民运科程科长负责，在武安高村，集中全纵队干部的家属。到今年四月已集中了二百九十个人。这些人里面，有的是中学生，有的是高初小生，还有的是不识字的农村妇女，也有政治文化水平相当高的、工作经验丰富的同志。根据这些人的程度，学习分为甲乙丙三班，高小以上程度的为甲班，初小三年以上程度的为乙班，初小二年程度以下和不识字的为丙班。行政管理编为两个分队，四个区队十六个班，从中选择优秀的担任队长和教员，并设立校部，归纵队后方留守处领导。留守处又委定王一书同志为校长，张海燕同志为副校长，张一明同志为教导员。健全学校的行政机构，召开校务与教务会议，确定改造思想，树立劳动观念的教育方针，又拟定行政与教育计划。到现在居然成了颇有可观的一所家属学校！
    开始，家属中有些人思想相当落后，有浓厚的太太思想。有的涂粉擦油，有的比你的爱人地位高我爱人的地位低，你的铺盖衣服好，我的铺盖衣服坏，闹情绪；有的要求回家，有的要求开办别的学校，不安心学习。六月间，纵队在安阳附近休整，校部宣布全体放假，叫她们去前方会见自己的爱人，在临去前，副校长训话：“你们到前方去，作风要朴素，不要摆太太架子，……”可是有些人当作耳旁风，最典型就是×××，在路上梳上东洋头，涂上粉，他以为修饰美丽点，可以博得爱人的欢心，可是一见自己的爱人，从前线归来，仆仆风尘，整天不是开会就是学习，忙忙碌碌的为人民立功，这里使她的坏思想上起了转变的波纹。从前方回来后，她的日记上写着：“这次我在前方住几星期，什么也没有帮助了他，倒给他增加了些负担，现在检讨起来，真是惭愧的要死！自己有什么资格用人家给打饭吃。”其他人从前方回来，思想上同样有所转变。
    武安在七月二十六日才落了些雨，但种的慢了，就不好出来，在这个关头，学校就停课帮助群众抢种，并提出人拉砘子、拉耧的号召，她们都响应这个号召，个个精神勃勃，跃跃欲试！
    有的同学说：“这是我们的劳动初试，看看谁的劳动观念强，看看谁的思想搞通，到地里兑现吧。”她们在地里两个人拉了张耧、三个人拉一个砘子，浑身大汗，把衣服都湿透了，她们一共帮助老百姓抢种七十多亩。
    高村吃水烧柴都很困难，留守处叫他迁移到和村。高村离和村有五六十里，校部估计这些学员没走过远路，还有些怀孕的、小脚的、病的，得要八十辆大车；但在这农忙时候，又得照顾群众生产，于是先作动员工作，动员加强群众观点，减轻人民负担，徒步行军少要大车，还得背上十斤左右背包，小脚的怀孕的有病的坐大车。她们经过动员后，小脚的怀孕的都要求不坐大车。她们在出发前一夜，都兴奋的睡不着，一早大家都爬起来收拾起零用东西，打起背包，吃了早饭，又回到各班宿舍扫除屋子，借的东西送还了，背起背包，去辞别房东，这村房东老的少的男的女的都送出来。
    她们到了和村后，连着下了两天雨，庄稼和草一齐长，天晴不赶快锄眼看就要荒，这时校部停课三天，号召帮助群众锄地，人人情绪都很高涨。一队给二队提出挑战竞赛，挑战条件是保证全队全体参加，又保证到地里不打闹，不损坏群众一棵苗。二队勇敢的应战，一二队的学员，争先恐后的参加，身体不好的怀着孕的也要求参加，队长指导员都制止不住。但各队负责人给村干部交涉，村干部却怕她们锄不了地，给损坏了庄稼，不让她们帮助。她们没办法，就再三的动员自己的房东说：“咱们试试，如锄不了，我们就不锄。”缠的房东没办法，才领到它的一块苗草膝盖高的地里，叫她们连拔带锄，她们一刻不歇，有的锄有的拔，很快的把一块五亩地锄了，不但没有损坏庄稼，还比男人锄的干净。这样第二天，村干部又找到各队说：“老百姓都愿叫给锄。”以后各班都分了工，村干部叫各地里主家，领着指给地块，她们便锄起来了，晌午还不回去。她们兴奋的一股劲儿干着唱着说着笑着，大家一天比一天情绪高涨，这样帮助了三天，没有一个说“累”的。在这三天里，一队每天五十三人，给曹家庄锄地十八亩，给杜家庄锄地四十二亩；二队给后连庄锄地五十八亩。在最后那天晚上，她们辞别杜家庄村干部和群众的时候，干部感激的说：“让你们吃饭，你们不吃，送你们东西，你们不要，我们就说你们立一大功，报到区上。”还有群众老头老婆男的女的互相谈论着：“人家是八路军的娘们，啥劳动都参加，蒋介石军队老婆们，不用说参加劳动，连她妈的洗澡都不动弹”，“这些八路军的娘们帮咱们锄地，要是中央军的，咱们连说话都跟不上。”
    每天晚饭后有三小时是生产时间，全校共有纺车六十辆，每两人伙使一个纺车，每人纺花一个半钟头，到生产时，全队都齐到一块，有的纺着花唱着歌，有的纺着花温习自己的文化课。全校学习是很紧张的，队与队比赛、班与班比赛、人与人比赛，有周测验、有月测验，各个同学都是认真学习着，文化低的同学更是加油。李改梅文化程度低，在休息时间，她偷着找一屋子去学习，还有刘艳风，保证每天认五个生字。油上加油的算是李羊，她不会写信，这次她的丈夫从前方来信说：“下次来信要你亲手写的。”她接这信后，可就记住了，每天都在学习写信。
