　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Reports from various sources: Former US Vice President Wallace delivered a speech in Boston on the 30th, advocating for the formation of an "organized and excellent resistance movement" by the American people to force the Truman administration and Congress to change their current war-oriented policies. He said: US foreign policy has unnecessarily created tension with the Soviet Union. He said: The minds of Americans are being shaped by people who call themselves afraid of communism, but what these people are actually afraid of is democracy. Wallace then expressed his satisfaction with his trip to Europe, because "no country in Europe is willing to fight or preparing for war." Wallace said: "I must frankly say that I do not expect the current government and Congress to have the courage to change our dangerous course until they see the American people express their determination to oppose policies that lead to war. This policy can only be changed by an organized and excellent resistance movement." Wallace condemned American newspaper publishers and Wall Street merchants for seizing control of American domestic and foreign policy. He said: "Many facts show that a rather small group of people (representing large financial institutions) guides our domestic and foreign policies." He also said: "These people who are afraid of democracy are using their vast power and all means of communication to cultivate hysteria. Everyone knows that they are using every propaganda trick to win people's support for corrupt policies." Wallace called for the removal of the threat from Wall Street, calling for "organizing forces to take control of the country away from Wall Street!"
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: According to TASS, New York, 2nd: Former US Vice President Wallace wrote an article in "The New Republic" magazine, condemning the Marshall Plan, saying: I have absolutely no confidence in any form of the Marshall Plan, because it makes Western Europe oppose Eastern Europe. Politically speaking, we will gain nothing but hatred. The government and Congress are naive to think that European countries will sell their political survival for billions of dollars. We are not loved in Europe, and the more we interfere in European affairs with economic pressure, the more they will hate us. The government believes that the use of military and economic pressure can temporarily give us unparalleled prestige in the United Nations. However, among the people of the world, our prestige is gradually declining. The implementation of the Marshall Plan will not help us regain our lost prestige.

　　华莱士号召美国人民
  　以组织优良的抵抗运动，把反动派控制权拿过来！
    【新华社陕北三日电】各方讯：美前副总统华莱士卅日在波士顿发表演说，力主组成美国人民“组织优良的抵抗运动”，以迫使杜鲁门政府及国会改变现行导向战争的各种政策。他说：美外交政策毫无必要地造成与苏联的紧张形势。他说：美国人的思想，正由一些自称为害怕共产主义的人们加以塑造，而其实这些人所害怕的是民主。华氏继对其欧洲之行表示满意，因为“欧洲没有一个国家愿意作战或准备战争。”华氏称：“我必须坦白地说，在现政府及国会看到美国人民表现决心反对导致战争的政策以前，我并不期望它们有改变我国危险方针的勇气。这种政策，只有用组织优良的抵抗运动来加以改变。”华氏谴责美国报纸发行人及华尔街商人攫取了美国内政外交政策的控制权。他说：“许多事实显示，相当小的一撮人（代表大金融机构）指导我们的内外政策。”又说：“这些害怕民主的人，运用他们的广大权力和一切通讯手段，来培植歇斯底里。谁都知道，他们正利用每一种宣传技俩来争取人民对腐朽政策的支持。”华氏要求去除华尔街的威胁，号召“组织力量，将华尔街对国家的控制权拿过来！”
    【新华社陕北三日电】据塔斯社纽约二日讯：美前副总统华莱士在“新共和”杂志上撰文，谴责马歇尔计划称：我对任何形式的马歇尔计划，绝无信心，因为它使西欧反对东欧。在政治上讲，我们除了遭人憎恨以外，毫无所得。政府及国会以为欧洲各国将为了数十亿金元而出卖他们的政治生存权，实在天真。我们在欧洲并不受人眷爱，我们愈用经济压力去干涉欧洲事务，他们愈会憎恨我们。政府以为使用军事与经济压力可以暂使我们在联合国中居于无匹的威望地位。但是，在世界人民中，我们的威望却逐渐低落。马歇尔计划的实行，将无助于我们重新赢得失去了的威望。
