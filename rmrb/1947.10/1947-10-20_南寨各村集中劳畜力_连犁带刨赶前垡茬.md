　　Nanzhai Villages Concentrate Labor and Animal Power
  　Plowing and Digging to Hasten Stubble Clearing
  　In Years of Flooding, Starting Early with Stubble Clearing Makes for Good Seedling Capture
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi News] The Nanzhai sub-district of the First District convened a meeting of key cadres from each village's political director, village chief, and farmers' association chairman on October 11th to discuss how to complete the autumn harvest and autumn plowing ahead of schedule. During the discussion, many muddled ideas were discovered: For example, the village chief and farmers' association chairman of Baoma Village said together: "Our village hasn't finished the autumn harvest yet, how can we plow? The ancients said: 'After the autumn harvest, spread the manure, then plow the land.' Our village has 1,800 mu of autumn land, only twenty-seven animals, and one hundred and three laborers. It will take until the first day of the tenth month to complete the harvest and stubble clearing." Everyone said: "Will it be frozen by the first day of the tenth month?" He said: "Plow one mu if we can plow one mu, if we can't plow it all, we'll plow it again in the spring. In the past, our village only plowed one-third of the land." The farmers' association chairman of Houxizhuang said: "Our village has few animals and laborers, so we can only harvest and not clear the stubble. This year we didn't use short-term labor, and I think the harvest is still quite fast!" The village chief of Shangqin Village said: "Our village originally wanted to complete the autumn plowing by the fourth day of the ninth month, but after a specific calculation of how much land the labor and animals can plow each day, it turns out that we won't be able to complete the autumn plowing until the fifteenth day of the ninth month." After discovering the problem, everyone was allowed to deliberate. During the study, Shi Panghai from Cuizhang Village spoke actively: "In the old society, our village only plowed half of the land, and it was all the landlords' land. We poor people couldn't even plow one mu. I lived as a farmhand for twelve years, plowing stubble for the landlords so they could catch seedlings well. They even said that the planting people had high skills, and that more raking and hoeing made it grow well, and that they were blessed. I didn't have time to clear the stubble on my own three mu of land. I plowed it once in the spring, and the land was dry, the clumps were big, it was hard to catch seedlings and it didn't grow well, and I said that I was an unlucky ghost. Farmers must not forget autumn stubble clearing, and women must not forget night spinning. Last year, I cleared all the stubble on my land, and the seedlings this year came out particularly evenly and grew about the same height. Autumn stubble clearing is just good. Our village has eighteen plows, and 1,420 mu of autumn land. Each plow can plow five mu a day (a total of ninety mu), which will take sixteen days. In order to complete it ahead of schedule, we organized twenty male full laborers and forty-five female full laborers, each day able to dig forty-five mu, making a five-day assault, digging a total of 225 mu. Starting on August 27th, we guarantee to complete the autumn plowing in twelve days. The remaining laborers thresh and clear the land, making sure that the threshing ground is clean and the land is cleared." The village chief of Houbeizhuang said: "In the past, our village had land but didn't plow it, just trying to earn money. The people said: 'Deceiving the Hui people' (plowing land for the Hui people in the city), the money earned was all spent. Other people's land grew well, but our own land grew badly. We poor people had nothing to eat in the spring, and we went to Li Keyi's house to get grain, with an interest of four sheng per dou. The land didn't grow well, and we were hungry. Today, listening to Shi Panghai say that autumn stubble clearing is good for catching seedlings and can produce more grain, I know that deceiving others in the past resulted in deceiving ourselves. Thinking back to the past, not plowing the land was a big loss. I will go back and tell the masses that everyone should know that stubble clearing is seasonal, and once the season is over, it will freeze. Transportation can earn money at any time. The six animals from the mill should be taken out, and all the full and half laborers in the village should be organized to plow and dig, guaranteeing that the autumn plowing will be completed by the eighth day of the ninth month. We will compete with Shi Panghai, and inspect on the ninth day." After this was said, it aroused the enthusiasm of the cadres attending the meeting from each village. The village chief of Shangqin Village said: "I will go back and organize eighty shallow plows (two people per plow), each able to plow four mu of land a day." The village chief of Nanzhai Village said: "I will go back and organize forty animals to plow the land, and two hundred and twenty laborers to dig the land. I will compete with Shi Panghai." A challenge competition and inspection were launched between the villages. At this time, the cadres of all twelve villages in the sub-district were filled with a sense of urgency, wanting to learn Shi Panghai's good methods of organization and division of labor, leaving not a single stubble field.

　　南寨各村集中劳畜力
  　连犁带刨赶前垡茬
  　涝年早下手垡地好捉苗
    【本报长治讯】一区南寨小区十月十一号召开各村政治主任、村长、农会主席之主要干部会议，讨论秋收秋耕如何提前完成。讨论中发现了不少糊涂思想：如暴马村村长农会主席一齐说：“我村收秋还没有完成，这还能犁地？古人说：收了秋，压了粪，再犁地。我村有秋地一千八百亩，只有二十七头牲口，劳力一百零三个，收完垡完茬地到十月初一日才能完成。”大家都说：“到十月初一是否冻了呢？”他说：“犁一亩算一亩，犁不了春天再犁。我村过去只犁三分之一。”堠西庄农会主席说：“我村牲口劳力少，只能收秋不能垡地，今年没用短工，我觉着收的还不慢哩！”上秦村村长说：“我村原想赶九月初四完成秋耕，具体一算，劳力畜力每天能犁地多少，结果九月十五才能完成秋耕。”发现问题后，让大家酝酿，研究中崔漳村史胖孩积极发言：“我村在旧社会只犁一半数，都是地主的地，咱们老穷人连一亩也犁不下。我住了十二年长工，给地主犁下茬地好捉苗，还说是耩地人把式高，多搂多锄长的好，还说人家有福气。我自己的三亩地顾不上垡，春天犁一遍，地又干，圪垃又大，不好捉苗长不好，还说自己是个薄命鬼。农民不要忘了秋垡地，女人不要忘了夜纺花，我去年把地都垡完了，今年的小苗出的特别齐，长的一般高，秋垡地就是好。我村有牲口十八犋，秋地一千四百二十亩，每一犋一天犁五亩（共犁九十亩），就得十六天，为了提前完成，组织男全劳力二十个，女全劳力四十五个，每一天能刨地四十五亩，突击五天，共刨地二百二十五亩。八月二十七日开始，保证十二天完成秋耕。其余劳力打场腾地，要做到场光地净。”堠北庄村长说：“我村过去是有地不犁，光图赚钱，老百姓说：哄回回哩（给城内回回犁地），赚上钱都零花完了，人家地长的好，自己地长的坏，咱穷人到了春天就没有吃的，到李克义家揭谷，每斗利是四升，地里长的又不好，没吃又受饿。今天听史胖孩说：秋垡地好捉苗，又能多打粮食，我才知道过去哄人家结果是哄了自己，回想过去不犁地是吃了大亏，我回去要向群众说，人人要知道垡地是季节的，过了节令就冻了，运输啥时候都能赚钱，把磨坊的六头牲口抽出来，把全村的全半劳力组织起来，犁的犁，刨的刨，保证九月初八完成秋耕。要和史胖孩比赛，初九日检查。”经这一说，引起各村到会干部的劲头，上秦村村长说：“我回去要组织八十个浅犁（二人一个），每个一天能犁地四亩。”南寨村长说：“我回去组织四十头牲口犁地，二百二十个劳力刨地，我和史胖孩比赛。”村与村掀起了挑战比赛与检查，这时全小区十二个村的干部，充满了紧张情绪，要学习史胖孩组织分工的好办法，不留一分茬地。
