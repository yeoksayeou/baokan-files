Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th -- A United Press dispatch from Peiping on the 28th reveals that Chiang Kai-shek's clique is currently using the pretext of cracking down on corruption and degeneration to eliminate local forces and miscellaneous army officers on a large scale. The dispatch stated: "T.V. Soong's effort in Guangdong will be a precursor to a large-scale action to replace warlord chairmen (referring to old miscellaneous army officers different from Chiang Kai-shek's warlords) nationwide with civil officials." It also stated: "The Central Government (Chiang Kai-shek's clique) continues to dismantle the staff structure of General Sun Lianzhong (Sun originally belonged to the old Northwest Army), the senior commander and chairman of Hebei Province. This action is interpreted as Nanjing's (Chiang Kai-shek's clique) policy of replacing old warlords in the government with its own energetic (trusted henchmen) people, just as it does in other regions." The dispatch reported that Yu Xinqing, director of the Political Design Committee of Sun Lianzhong's Baoding Pacification Headquarters, and Xie Ziyin (transliteration), director of Sun's personnel department, have been arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's clique on corruption charges, and other aides of Sun Lianzhong have also been rounded up. A Mr. Wen (transliteration), who "held the second most important position" in the Political Design Committee, has also fled to avoid arrest. The dispatch quoted comments from well-informed sources, stating: "Even if they are guilty of corruption, it is only a smokescreen for the Central Government (Chiang Kai-shek's clique) to strengthen its control over this area by undermining Sun's position, as it does in other regions."

　　蒋匪排挤杂牌军官孙连仲也将要倒霉
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据二十八日合众社北平电讯透露：蒋匪目前正借口取缔贪污腐化，大规模的排除地方势力与杂牌军官。该电称：“宋子文的文粤，将是大肆撤换全国军阀（按指不同于蒋介石军阀的其他杂牌旧军官）主席为文官的行动的先声。”并称：“中央政府（蒋匪）继续摧毁高级指挥官兼河北省主席孙连仲将军（按：孙原系老西北军系）的参谋机构，这种行为被解释为南京（蒋匪）撤换政府中的旧军阀，而代以南京（蒋匪）自己的有能量（心腹爪牙）的政策的一部分。”该电报导：孙连仲的保定绥靖公署政治设计委员会主任委员余心清，及孙之人事处处为谢子银（译音），已被蒋匪用腐化罪名加以逮捕，且一并搜捕孙连仲之其他助手。在政治设计委员会“占第二把交椅”的温（译音）某，亦因避捕而逃匿。该电引消息灵通人士的评论称：“他们纵然有腐化罪，也是中央政府（蒋匪）如象对其他地区一样，要以危害孙氏地位来加强对此地区的控制的烟幕。”
