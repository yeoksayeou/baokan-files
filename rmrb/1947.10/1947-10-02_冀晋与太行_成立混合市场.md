　　Ji-Jin and Taihang
  　Establish Mixed Market
    [Our newspaper, P’ingting dispatch] Since our army liberated Yangchuan, P’ingting, Shouyang and other places in the Cheng-Tai Campaign, the Chahar-Hebei-Shansi Border Region and the Shansi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region have been connected. Now, the Ji-Jin Region of the north of the road (referring to the Cheng-Tai Railway), Yangchuan, Shouyang, and the counties south of the road, P’ingting, Jingxing, etc., have established a mixed market on August 10 to conduct free trade and exchange goods between the two regions. Because the currencies of the two regions (Ji banknotes and border currency) are different, the Ji mixed market has decided that local banks will be responsible for the exchange after its establishment. At present, the markets in Yangchuan and P’ingting are well-stocked with various goods. The number of shops, cooperatives, small mutual aid societies, and peddlers is increasing day by day, and the market is becoming more prosperous. (Ke Qin)

　　冀晋与太行
  　成立混合市场
    【本报平定讯】自我军正太战役解放了阳泉，平定、寿阳等地方后，晋察冀边区与晋冀鲁豫边区已连成一片，现已由路北（指正太路）冀晋区、阳泉、寿阳、与路南、平定、井陉等县、于八月十日，成立混合市场，进行自由贸易，交流两地区货物。因两地区货币（冀钞与边币）不同，冀混合市场成立后，决定由各地银行负责兑换。现阳泉、平定市场，各样货物俱全，商号、合作社、小型互助社、小贩买卖日渐增多，市场更加繁荣。（克勤）
