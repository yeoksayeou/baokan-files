In Memory of Mr. Xu Fanting

　　Dong Biwu

　　Daizhou abounds in heroes, and Mr. Xu was even more outstanding.
　　Cherishing talent to quell the chaos, he forgot himself for the sake of the country.
　　Bloodstains mark the cemetery, his achievements shine new like the sun and moon.
　　His will has profound meaning, his death also returns to truth.
　　We stayed together at Ganquan, you shared the oily pears with me. (Note 1)
　　Writing poems to express feelings, enduring wind and frost while sick in bed.
　　Thoroughly eradicate feudalism, establish a firm stance from the beginning. (Note 2)
　　Your spirit is rich and undying, the mountains and rivers will forever be illuminated.

　　(Note 1) In April of this year, Mr. Xu stayed in Ganquan Village, Lin County. I rested in this village for several days during my journey eastward. Mr. Xu obtained oily pears from his hometown of Guoxian, a famous product! He specially shared them with me to taste. (Note 2) Mr. Xu supported land reform, saying, "Where there are landlords, there is no democracy."

　　续范亭先生挽诗
    董必武
    代郡多豪杰，先生更出群。
    怀才能拨乱，许国已忘身。
    血迹陵园地，勋明日月新。
    遗书有深意，易箦亦归真。
    同作甘泉宿，油梨分我尝。（注一）
    吟诗遣怀抱，卧病阅风霜。
    彻底夷封建，从头稳立场。（注二）
    精灵富不没，山水永增光。
    （注一）今年四月先生宿临县甘泉村，我于东行旅途中休息是村者数日。先生得梓乡崞县油梨，名产也！特分遗我尝之。（注二）先生赞成土改，有句云：“那里有地主，那里无民主”。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四七年九月二十一日晨未定稿。
