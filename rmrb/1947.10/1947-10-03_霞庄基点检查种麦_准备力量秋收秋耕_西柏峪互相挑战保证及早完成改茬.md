[Report from this newspaper in Licheng] The three administrative villages (Kongbei Society) of the Xia Village baseline selected cadres and heroes on the 20th of this month to conduct in-depth and widespread checks on wheat sowing. Basically, the regular wheat fields of the entire baseline have completed all sowing, with only a few households not having planted. In terms of technology, in addition to some local wheat varieties that have been soaked and disinfected, the vast majority of the rest, including "169", have all been soaked in ash water and warm water; the land has been plowed enough times, with a few plowed only twice. Two-legged rakes are generally used for sowing, and methods such as spot sowing and furrow sowing are used for land with less fertilizer. The village's political director said, "We went to Xia Village to check, from top to bottom, and it's generally very good. In particular, the labor hero Wang Fengqi's group did even better, truly achieving deep plowing and careful cultivation. The only problem is that dozens of acres in Changjiao Ridge haven't been planted, and secondly, the cotton fields on the hillside were poorly managed, and some haven't been topped." During the evaluation, Wang Tianwen said, "The village chief has great enthusiasm and is very well organized, truly forming a movement. He transferred 30 livestock from the village to help Majia [deputy village] with sowing, which is really not simple. He should be first." Village head and labor hero Wang Songhuai said, "Xia Village's technology is very good, much better than our village. Our production work should not only be fast, but also pay attention to technology and good planting. We should learn from them. Xia Village should be first." The Tinghe village chief said, "In terms of technology, Xia Village is better, in terms of enthusiasm, the village chief is greater. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, so the two villages are the same." In the end, everyone unanimously proposed that we have all won this time, and we should prepare our forces to fight another beautiful battle in the autumn harvest and autumn planting."

[Report from this newspaper in Licheng] The Xibayu baseline promoted crop rotation, autumn harvest and autumn planting after checking wheat planting. On September 24th, 31 cadres, heroes, poor peasants and active members from the four villages of Dongbayu, Xibayu, Langzhuang, and Liudong participated in each village in groups to check whether the wheat fields had been completely planted, the quality of the technology, and whether the wasteland had been eliminated. They checked in the morning and exchanged experiences in Xibayu in the afternoon. Zhang Liuchang said, "I checked in Langzhuang, and the wheat planting technology is very good, and the fertilizer is applied in two layers, especially hero Li Guangtian, the land is also well managed and also has two layers of fertilizer, and the crop rotation wheat has been soaked, and also has two layers of fertilizer, first the sheep grazed the land, and then it was planted with [something unreadable]." Li San then said, "Li Fushan in Dongbayu has abandoned wheat fields, and some land was planted without leveling the edges." After such an inspection, everyone said, "Langzhuang's wheat planting technology is very good, and the fertilizer is also very large, 40 loads per mu on flat land, and now 31 mu of wheat have been converted." Everyone admitted that this village had completed the best wheat planting. Afterwards, each village also established plans for autumn harvest, crop rotation, and autumn planting. And put forward a challenge, the conditions are: (1) Ensure the completion of the crop rotation plan, cornfield intercropping. (2) Crop rotation must be plowed twice, and no fertilizer is allowed. (3) All and half laborers must be properly organized and used for crop rotation and autumn harvest without wasting a bit. (4) Ensure that wheat is grown for the families of soldiers fighting drought and for the militia participating in the war, and bring back the autumn harvest early. (5) Complete seed selection in the field. Everyone decided to check in 20 days, and everyone's enthusiasm is very high.

    【本报黎城讯】霞庄基点三个行政村（空北社），于本月二十日各选出干部英雄，进行深入普遍的小麦下种检查。全基点正茬麦，基本上是完成全部下种，只有少数户儿没种上。在技术方面，除本地小麦有部分经过浸种消毒外，其余绝大部分和“一六九”全部都经过灰水和温水浸种；地都犁够三遍，有少数只耕过二犁，普遍改用两条腿耧下种，和肥少的地采用点种与溜种等办法。庄头政治主任说：“俺们到霞庄检查，从上＠一直检查到下＠，大致都很好，特别是劳英王逢奇小组做的更好，真正做到了深耕细作，就是在长脚岭有几十亩没种上，其次在山边有几块棉花修理差，还有没打顶”。评判中王天文说：“庄头工作劲头大，组织很好，真正形成运动，他从村里调剂牲口三十头，到麻家＠（副村）帮助下种，这真是不简单呢，应该是第一。”庄头劳英王宋怀说：“霞庄村的技术搞的很好，比俺村强的多，咱们的生产工作不但要快，还要讲究技术种好，我们应该学习，霞庄应该是第一”。停河村长说：“论技术是霞庄好，论劲头是庄头大，各有优缺点，两村一样吧。”最后大家一致提出咱们今次工作都打了胜仗，准备力量，在秋收秋耕当中，再打个漂亮仗”。
