Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, Moscow, 11th: The prominent Soviet economist, Masdainikov, recently gave a speech in Moscow entitled "The Economic Crisis in Kuomintang China." He first pointed out: "The current drastic deterioration of the economic situation in China (Kuomintang-controlled areas) is the result of a joint offensive launched by American expansionists and the Kuomintang reactionary group against the growing democratic forces of the Chinese people." He then analyzed: "Because the Kuomintang launched a civil war with the direct assistance of US imperialism, it had to spend huge sums of money. According to the official first-quarter financial report materials this year, the (Chiang) government's expenditure almost doubled the budget. All of this huge military expenditure has to be borne by the Chinese people. As a result, on the one hand, Chinese peasants are completely ruined because they have to pay 50% to 70% of their harvest to the landlords, and another 20% to the Kuomintang government. Large areas of farmland in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were largely abandoned in 1946 due to a lack of seeds. On the other hand, it has caused inflation and the continuous devaluation of the legal currency. The exchange rate between the US dollar and the legal currency was 1 to 3 in 1937, and it remained at the level of 1 to 20 during the Anti-Japanese War. When the civil war broke out, it had become 1 to 2,000, and in September this year, it rose to 1 to 49,500. (Note: The above exchange rates are all official prices. Recently, the black market in Shanghai has been above 1 to 90,000.) This inflation inevitably caused a sharp rise in the cost of living. As of the summer of this year, the price of consumer goods has increased by 31,000 times compared with before the war (according to official statistics). As a result, famine is rampant everywhere, and armed peasant rebellions have broken out in many provinces. Rice riots have swept through about 40 cities in 13 provinces of Kuomintang China." Masdainikov claimed: "The Kuomintang government is currently completely incapable of managing the national economy under the circumstances of economic chaos and inflation. In 1946, all steel factories were shut down (referring to the Kuomintang-controlled areas), the coal production areas and coal mines can only produce 30 percent, silk production is only 25 percent of pre-war levels, and cotton yarn is only 40 percent of pre-war levels." Masdainikov pointed out that after causing the Chinese economic crisis, American imperialists are using this crisis to further colonize China. Masdainikov stressed: "The economic chaos in Kuomintang China has greatly benefited American expansionists who are bent on conquering China economically and politically. After Japan surrendered, the United States took the opportunity to provide large loans to the Kuomintang government and sold 281 warships, as well as equipping and training about 60 Kuomintang divisions, as exchange conditions, and achieved the conclusion of the "Sino-US Friendship Commerce and Navigation Treaty" in November 1946, obtaining the right to exploit Chinese mines and build bases. American companies can also develop oil and seize coal mines in China, build large power plants, and dump cheap American goods in China on a large scale, competing with national industries. The new "aid" plan formulated by Wedemeyer this time is actually to obtain eleven Chinese military bases in exchange. The United States allows the Kuomintang to retrain 20 divisions, supply aircraft and weapons, and provide large loans. In this way, the Kuomintang government has sold out China's independence and the freedom of the Chinese people."

　　苏联著名经济学家指出：
  　蒋区经济剧烈恶化
    是美蒋联合进攻人民的结果
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：苏联著名经济学家马斯逮尼科夫顷在莫斯科以“国民党中国的经济危机”为题发表演讲。他首先指出：“目前中国（蒋管区）经济情势如此剧烈恶化，乃是美国扩张主义者与国民党反动集团对中国人民日益增长的民主力量发动联合进攻的结果。”继则分析：“国民党因以美帝国主义的直接援助发动内战，而不得不支出庞大的费用，根据今年官方第一季财政报告材料，（蒋）政府的支出几乎超过预算两倍。而这庞大的军费全部都要由中国人民负担，其结果一方面是中国农民因为除了要向地主交纳百分之五十至七十的收获物外，还必须再向国民党政府交纳百分之二十，而全部倾家荡产。国民党统治区的广大田园，在一九四六年都因缺乏种籽而大部荒废。另一方面又造成通货膨胀与法币连续不断的贬值，一九三七年美元与法币之兑换率为一比三，抗日战争时期还保持在一比二十的水平上。到了内战爆发时就已变成了一比二千，而今年九月就涨到一比四万九千五百了。（按以上汇率全为官价，最近上海黑市已在一比九万以上。）这种通货膨胀又必然引起生活费的暴涨，迄今年夏季为止，消费品的价格已较战前上涨三万一千倍（按系官方统计数字）。因而饥馑猖獗于各地，许多省份爆发了武装农民叛乱，米骚动席卷国民党中国的十三个省份约四十个城市。”马氏称：“国民党政府现时经济混乱与通货膨胀的情况下，完全没有能力管理国家经济。一九四六年钢铁工厂全部停顿（指蒋管区），煤产区及煤矿所能生产的百分之三十，生丝产量仅及战前百分之二十五，棉纱仅及战前百分之四十。”马氏指出美帝国主义者在造成中国经济危机之后，又利用此一危机以进一步殖民地化中国。马氏力称：“国民党中国的经济混乱，大大裨益了一心要想在经济上和政治上征服中国的美国扩张主义者。在日本投降以后，美国就会乘机以大量贷款贷给国民党政府，并卖与二百八十一艘军舰，及装备与训练了约六十个国民党师等项援助为交换条件，而达到于一九四六年十一月缔结“中美友好通商航海条约”，取得了中国的矿业开采与基地修筑权。美国公司亦可在中国开发石油攫取煤矿矿脉，建立大电力厂等，并以廉价美货大量倾销中国，与民族工业竞争。而此次魏德迈所拟定的新“援助”计划，实际上就是以取得十一个中国的军事基地为交换条件，美国允许给国民党再训练二十个师、供应飞机及武器，以及大量的贷款。如此则国民党政府就出卖了中国的独立与中国人民的自由。”
