　　Changzhi Masses Compete to Pay Contributions
    [Our newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] After the news of the agricultural income tax collection spread to various villages, the masses' enthusiasm was very high. They competed to pay the counter-offensive funds, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous bandits, and defend the fruits of their liberation. For example, Wang Tieni, the leader of the Huili mutual aid group, immediately convened his group for discussion, and the next day his group completely paid off their dues. Wang Anhao from Beihe Village said, "Pay the money early, and the fighting at the front will be even better!" Xingdui from Nanman said, "Paying contributions is for eradicating the old roots. If we don't eradicate the old roots, we won't be able to live well in our grand houses. I want to pay early to support the front line!" During the mobilization meeting in Beicheng, after the village chief announced the news of victory, labor hero Wang Shuangzhu happily said, "To knock down Chiang Kai-shek's dog head, we must use our own sweat and blood to support the front line!" and said, "In addition to my own due amount, I want to pay an extra 1,500 yuan to support the front line!" Liu Dalian and Wang Huazi, two textile groups, also volunteered to pay an extra 16,100 yuan. The entire village cleared the dues within two days, exceeding the allocated amount by 127,000 yuan. The masses in Beixian paid an extra 78,900 yuan. Villages such as Dongcheng, Liujia Village, Xinyi, and Jiazhang also exceeded their allocated amounts. The masses all said, "As long as we knock down Chiang Kai-shek earlier and remove this big stone slab, what does paying a few contributions matter!" The entire county largely completed the task within five days, with a total overpayment of 289,700 yuan for the counter-offensive funds, and generally ensured that the payments were made without selling grain.

　　长治群众争相交款
    【本报长治讯】征收农业所得税的消息传到各村后，群众情绪非常高涨，争相交反攻款，消灭蒋介石卖国贼，保卫翻身果实。如会里互助组长王铁女马上就召集他组进行讨论，第二天他组就完全交清了；北和村王安好说：“交款交的早，前方打仗打的更好！”南满邢堆则说：“出款为了刨老根，刨不掉老根我们的大堂楼住不好。我要早交，支援前线！”北呈在开动员大会时，村长说了胜利消息后，劳动英雄王双柱高兴的说：“要把蒋介石狗头打掉，非拿出自己血汗支援前线不行！”并说：“我除自己应交数目外，要多交一千五百元支援前线！”刘大连王花仔两个纺织组，自报也要多交一万六千一百元；全村两天内即把款收清，并超过应摊款十二万七千元。北仙群众多交七万八千九百元，东呈、六家村、信义、贾掌等村也超过应摊数目，群众都说：“只要早些把蒋介石打倒，揭了这块大石板，出几个款算啥！”全县五天内即大部完成，共计多交反攻款二十八万九千七百元，并普遍做到交款不粜粮食。（建功）
