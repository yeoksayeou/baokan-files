    Safeguarding the Autumn Harvest While Helping with Harvesting
    Shouyang Independent Regiment Harvests Over 700 Mu in Three Days
    [This newspaper's Taihang News] Our Second Military Subdistrict's Shouyang Independent Regiment, under the slogan "Harvest wherever we fight, safeguard the autumn harvest, and help with harvesting when not fighting," used the strength of one battalion to participate in the local masses' harvesting efforts on the 11th, 13th, and 14th. In three days, they harvested a total of 783 mu, and proposed striving for 1,000 mu. Every officer and soldier strives to perform meritorious service for the people during the harvesting assistance. Comrade Pang Yunxing, commander of our 3rd company, personally took action to lead everyone in setting up mutual aid groups, with competition between groups and squads to see who could cut faster and better. Their cooking squad, in addition to cooking, also harvested more than 20 mu of grain. Seeing the great enthusiasm of Company Commander Pang in assisting with the harvest, the officers and soldiers of the 7th company, under the leadership of the instructor, did not eat and continued to harvest for half a day on empty stomachs. They are still continuing to assist with the harvest. (Feng Yi)

    一面保秋一面助收
    寿阳独立团三天收割七百余亩
    【本报太行讯】我二分区寿阳独立团在“打到那里收到那里，一面保秋，一面助收，不打仗就助收”的口号下，于十一、十三、十四三天，以一个营的兵力，参加驻地群众收割，三天共计收割七百八十三亩，并提出向千亩奋斗，每一个指战员争取在助收中为民立功，我三连连长庞运兴同志亲自动手领导大家搞互助组，组与组、班与班提出竞赛，看谁割的快，割的好，他们炊食班除作饭外还割了二十多亩谷子。七连的指战员看到庞连助收劲头大，在指导员领导下，全体同志没吃饭，饿着肚子一直割了半天。现仍继续助收中。（凤仪）
