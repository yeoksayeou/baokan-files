    Developing Friendly Relations Between China and Indonesia

    Just as the friendly relations between China and Indonesia have taken on a new development, and just as the Chinese people are warmly receiving the Prime Minister of the Republic of Indonesia, Ali Sastroamidjojo, the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, which aims to develop friendly relations and cultural exchange between the two countries, was established in Beijing yesterday. This is a matter of great significance.

    In January of this year, people from all walks of life in Indonesia established the Indonesia-China Friendship Association. Professor Priyono, the esteemed Indonesian peace warrior and winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, whom the Chinese people respect, serves as the president of this association, and many other prominent public leaders in Indonesia have joined this organization. They have expressed their intention to strive to develop closer cultural relations in the broadest sense and to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese peoples.

    The establishment of the two friendship associations has formed a bond of friendly ties between the peoples of the two countries, reflecting the common desire of the two peoples to further enhance their mutual friendship. We believe that through the extensive activities of the friendship associations, mutual understanding and close ties between the peoples of the two countries will be greatly strengthened, thereby promoting the further development of friendly relations between the two countries. This will inevitably contribute to the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world.

    The friendly ties between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples have a long history of one or two thousand years. As early as the beginning of the second century AD, the peoples of the two countries had contact with each other, and cultural and trade relations between the two countries began at that time. The fragments of pottery from the Han Dynasty excavated on the main islands of Indonesia are proof of this. Later, famous Chinese monks such as Fa Xian and Yi Jing visited Indonesia. The Buddhist scriptures translated by Yi Jing have become historical materials for studying ancient Buddhism in Indonesia. Trade between the two countries flourished even more after the Tang and Song dynasties. In the first half of the fifteenth century, Zheng He led a large number of "treasure ships" loaded with valuable Chinese goods, sailing "to the West" seven times to trade with Indonesia and more than thirty other countries. At the same time, a large number of Chinese people continuously migrated to various parts of Indonesia. They worked diligently for generations and established close relationships with the local people. Now, the resolution of the dual nationality issue will make the people of the two countries even closer. Patriotic overseas Chinese must be more modest, respect the customs and laws of their country of residence, be close and friendly with the Indonesian people, and strive to promote friendly relations between the two countries.

    The economic and cultural ties between our two peoples have been obstructed by colonialists, but the shared experience of the two peoples in resisting colonial oppression and rule for a long time has deepened mutual understanding and friendship.

    Our two peoples, together with peace-loving countries and peoples in Asia and around the world, are making joint efforts to maintain peace in Asia and the world and to promote friendship among nations. We have participated in various peace activities in the Asian and Pacific region, advocating peaceful coexistence among countries, opposing the organization of aggressive military blocs, opposing war preparations and the use of atomic weapons, and striving to ease international tensions. The peaceful efforts of the Asian people are playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. The success of the Asian-African Conference is inseparable from the joint efforts of the peoples of Asian and African countries, among which the Indonesian people have made particularly important contributions. As the outstanding peace warrior Professor Priyono said when accepting the Stalin Peace Prize, "Peace, just peace, will lead to progress and prosperity." This is precisely the common sentiment and urgent desire of the Indonesian people and the people of all countries.

    It is precisely on the basis of this common experience and common desire that the friendly relations between our two governments and peoples are constantly developing. Especially in the past two years, through the efforts of both sides, the relations between the two countries have been built on a deeper and broader foundation, making the exchanges and contacts between the two peoples increasingly close. The two countries successively signed trade agreements and related agreements in 1953 and 1954, and now they are going to further develop economic cooperation between the two countries. In terms of culture, the Indonesian government sent an art troupe to visit our country, and the art exhibitions held in major Chinese cities have allowed the Chinese people to learn more about and appreciate the outstanding artistic achievements of Indonesia. Our cultural delegation is also about to depart for a visit to Indonesia. The exhibition of the Chinese Pavilion at the first Indonesian International Exposition and the Chinese Arts and Crafts Exhibition held in Indonesia in January this year introduced the development of industry, agriculture, and people's arts and crafts in China after liberation. Representatives from all walks of life in Indonesia, including workers, composers, scholars, cultural and educational workers, doctors, civil servants, members of parliament, women, youth, and Muslim representatives, have come to visit our country. By the end of 1954, more than 200 Indonesian friends had visited our country. Now, the friendly relations between our two countries will be advanced a big step by the mutual visits of the Prime Ministers of the two countries and the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of the two countries. This is fully in line with the common interests and common aspirations of the people of the two countries.

    Obviously, the prospects for friendly cooperation between the two countries are very broad. The conditions that can now be used to strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries are waiting to be fully utilized. In the future, with the economic and cultural development of the two countries, more favorable conditions will be continuously created. The friendship association organizations established by our two peoples each have the glorious task of continuously strengthening the understanding, trust, and ties between the peoples of the two countries, and developing friendly cooperative relations between the two countries. The Chinese people express their full support for this work that is conducive to consolidating peace in Asia and the world, and warmly congratulate the establishment and development of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association.

### 发展中国和印度尼西亚友好关系

    发展中国和印度尼西亚友好关系
    恰好在中国和印度尼西亚之间的友好关系有了新的发展，恰好在中国人民热烈接待印度尼西亚共和国总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约的时候，以发展两国友好关系和文化交流为宗旨的中国—印度尼西亚友好协会昨天在北京成立了。这是一件有重要意义的事情。
    今年一月间，印度尼西亚各界人士成立了印度尼西亚—中国友好协会。中国人民所尊敬的印度尼西亚卓越的和平战士、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金获奖人普里约诺教授，担任这个协会的会长，印度尼西亚其他许多著名公众领袖都参加了这个组织。他们表示将努力在最广泛的意义上展开更密切的文化关系，增进印度尼西亚人民和中国人民之间的互相了解和友谊。
    两个友好协会的成立，形成了两国人民之间的友好联系的纽带，反映了两国人民进一步增进相互友谊的共同愿望。我们相信，通过友好协会的广泛活动，两国人民间的相互了解和密切联系将会大大加强起来，从而推动两国友好关系的进一步发展。这必然会有助于维护亚洲和世界的和平。
    中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的友好联系，有一两千年的悠久历史。早在公元二世纪初，两国人民就有了互相来往，两国文化和贸易上的关系也在那时开始了。在印度尼西亚主要岛屿上发掘出的汉代陶器残片，即是证明。后来中国著名高僧法显和义净等，都曾访问印度尼西亚，义净所译佛经已成为研究印度尼西亚古代佛教的史籍。两国贸易在唐宋以后更为兴盛。十五世纪前半，郑和曾率领大批“宝船”满载中国贵重商品，七下“西洋”同印度尼西亚和其他三十余国进行贸易。同时，数目众多的中国人民，不断地移居印度尼西亚各地。他们世世代代辛勤劳动，并同当地人民建立了亲密的关系。现在双重国籍问题的解决，将使两国人民更加亲密。爱国华侨一定要更加谦虚，尊重侨居国的习惯和法律，同印度尼西亚人民亲密友好，努力促进两国的友好关系。
    我们两国人民的经济和文化联系，曾受到殖民主义者的阻隔，但两国人民长期反抗殖民主义压迫和统治的共同经历，却更加深了相互的了解和友谊。
    我们两国人民同亚洲及全世界爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，为维护亚洲及世界和平、促进各国友好的事业，进行着共同的努力。我们参加了亚洲及太平洋区域的各项和平活动，主张各国和平共处，反对组织侵略性的军事集团，反对战争准备和使用原子武器，争取缓和国际紧张局势。亚洲人民的和平努力，正在国际事务中起着越来越重大的作用。亚非会议能够取得成就，就是同亚非各国人民的共同努力分不开的，其中印度尼西亚人民作出了特别重要的贡献。杰出的和平战士普里约诺教授在接受斯大林和平奖金时说得好：“和平、正义的和平将导致进步和繁荣。”这正是印度尼西亚人民和各国人民普遍的思想感情和迫切愿望。
    正是基于这种共同经历和共同愿望，我们两国政府和人民之间的友好关系，不断在发展着。尤其是在最近两年来，经过双方的努力，已把两国关系建立在更加深广的基础上，使两国人民的来往和接触日益密切起来。两国先后在一九五三年和一九五四年签订了贸易协定和有关协议，现在还要进一步发展两国的经济合作。在文化上，印度尼西亚政府派遣访问我国的艺术团，和在中国主要城市展出的艺术展览会，使中国人民更多地了解和欣赏了印度尼西亚优秀的艺术成就。我国文化代表团也即将启程访问印度尼西亚。我国参加印度尼西亚首届国际博览会的中国馆的展览，和今年一月中国工艺美术展览会在印度尼西亚的展出，介绍了中国解放后工农业和人民美术工艺的发展情况。印度尼西亚各界代表包括工人、作曲家、学者、文教工作者、医生、公务人员、国会议员、妇女、青年和回教代表等，纷纷前来我国访问。到一九五四年年底止，访问我国的印度尼西亚朋友们有二百多人。现在，我们两国的友好关系，将因两国总理的相互访问，两国总理的联合声明，而推进一大步。这是完全符合两国人民的共同利益和共同愿望的。
    很显然，两国友好合作的前景十分广阔。现在可能用来加强两国友好合作的条件，正有待于充分利用。将来随着两国经济和文化的发展，还会不断创造更多的有利条件。我们两国人民各自建立的友好协会组织，都负有光荣的任务来不断加强两国人民的了解、信任和联系，发展两国友好合作关系。中国人民对这个有利于巩固亚洲和世界和平的工作，表示完全的支持，并热烈祝贺中国—印度尼西亚友好协会的成立和发展。
