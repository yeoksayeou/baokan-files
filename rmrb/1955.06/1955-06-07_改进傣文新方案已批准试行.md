    Improved Dai Script Scheme Approved for Trial Implementation
    The new improved Dai script scheme proposed by the Xishuangbanna Dai Script Improvement Committee has been approved by the Central Government for trial implementation, and relevant departments are making various preparations for the trial.
    The Xishuangbanna Dai script is a phonetic script prevalent throughout the autonomous region. After the implementation of regional autonomy in January 1953, the Dai script became the main tool for the Autonomous Region People's Government to perform its duties. However, the original Dai script had some shortcomings and was greatly limited in its use, with little development for a long time. In August 1953, the Second People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in Xishuangbanna passed a resolution to establish the Xishuangbanna Dai Script Improvement Committee. The Yunnan Work Team of the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the former Yunnan Provincial People's Government Ethnic Affairs Committee dispatched professional cadres to conduct in-depth investigations and research in collaboration with the Autonomous Region People's Government and local intellectuals, and formulated an improvement plan.
    The improved scheme approved by the Central Government for trial implementation has been praised by Dai people in the autonomous region. This improved Dai script is easy to teach and learn, convenient for writing and printing, and more regular, making the script more standardized and able to more accurately represent the Dai language.

    改进傣文新方案已批准试行
    由西双版纳傣族文字改进委员会提出的改进傣文新方案，已经中央批准试行，有关部门正在作试行的各种准备工作。
    西双版纳傣族文字是一种拼音文字，通行自治区各地。一九五三年一月实行区域自治后，傣文成为自治区人民政府执行职务的主要工具。但是，原来的傣文有一些缺点，使用上受到很大限制，长期以来没有多大发展。一九五三年八月举行的西双版纳各族各界第二届人民代表会议通过决议，成立了西双版纳傣族文字改进委员会。中国科学院语言研究所云南工作队及原云南省人民政府民族事务委员会都派出了专业干部，协同自治区人民政府和当地知识分子进行了深入的调查研究，制定了改进方案。
    经中央批准试行的改进方案受到自治区傣族人士的称赞，这种改进了的傣文，易教易学，书写、印刷便利，并且更有规律性，使文字进一步定型化，更能够正确地代表傣族语言。（新华社）
