    Leading Peasants in Haymaking to Protect Livestock
    Last year, most villages in the Daceying District of Mancheng County, Hebei Province, suffered from disasters. This year, these villages are facing a severe shortage of livestock feed, causing many livestock to become thin and weak, seriously affecting the development of agricultural and sideline production.
    To solve this problem, the responsible staff of the District Committee immediately went to the villages to understand the situation. Wang Luogui, Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, discovered in Shenxing Village that three peasant households, including Zhang Luotou's, were not wealthy, but their livestock were well-fed. Upon inquiry, he learned that they were feeding their livestock with bitter lettuce leaves, which is a very nutritious feed in the spring. Wang Luogui immediately introduced this experience at a meeting of the agricultural cooperative committee led by Zhang Loda in the village. In order not to delay the spring plowing, the cooperative committee immediately decided to mobilize women and children to cut bitter lettuce leaves and determined the method of remuneration. Then, they announced the haymaking and livestock protection plan to all cooperative members, and the haymaking and livestock protection work in the village began.
    Later, the District Committee widely promoted the method of cutting bitter lettuce leaves to solve the problem of livestock feed throughout the district.
    However, a problem arose: there was not enough bitter lettuce leaves to completely solve the livestock feed issue. The District Committee immediately gathered feeders and experienced farmers from various cooperatives for a discussion and found that six other types of grass, such as "Mi Dai Kou" (米口袋) and small reed grass, could also be used as livestock feed, thus solving the feed shortage. At this time, another problem arose: many cooperatives had a heavy burden due to paying cash for grass. The District Committee and branches led the cooperatives in educating the members on "loving the cooperative and protecting livestock to achieve increased production." Except for cooperative members with special difficulties who were paid cash for cutting grass, the grass cut by general cooperative members was used as an investment in the cooperative at a price, to be returned in the fall. After these problems were solved, the haymaking and livestock protection movement throughout the district proceeded smoothly. By early May, 369,000 catties of grass had been cut, and the weakened condition of more than 2,000 livestock had greatly improved, and more than 200 livestock that could not produce had also resumed production.

    Caring for the Lives of Workers
    In the past, the Party organization and administration of the 420 Work Section of the First Work Area of the Fourth Engineering Company in Wuhan City were very unconcerned about the welfare of the workers. The workers' food was poor and often undercooked; the workers also lacked proper cultural life, and many workers read absurd, obscene, and supernatural novels; or they stayed out late at night and often missed work the next day, seriously affecting the completion of basic construction tasks.
    In April, the Party branch of the work section convened a meeting of Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres to study ways to improve workers' lives and cultural and recreational activities. Then, Branch Secretary Liu Huayun convened a discussion with the catering staff, explaining the significance of improving meals for enhancing workers' enthusiasm for production, and guiding everyone to conduct criticism and self-criticism, criticizing the lack of unity and lack of dedication among the cooks. Finally, specific measures for improvement were determined. Afterwards, the food was quickly improved, and the workers were very satisfied. They said, "Now we spend less money, eat better, and have more energy for the labor competition."
    To ensure that workers have sufficient rest time and proper recreational activities, the branch, through the labor union, urged the workers to take a nap at noon, and also led everyone to carry out basketball, volleyball, and park activities, as well as a major cleaning campaign. The clinic also carried out tetanus and other disease prevention injections to prevent the occurrence of diseases.
    Afterwards, the branch strengthened the propaganda of the Party's policies and current affairs, encouraging the enthusiasm of employees to carry out labor competitions. The production enthusiasm of employees has significantly improved. For example, carpenters could only complete 50 percent of their quota, but now they have reached 125 percent of the quota. The production plans for the first and middle ten days of April were overfulfilled. (Jiang Guangming)
    "On-Site Meeting" for Exchanging Experiences
    Zhao Xiu, Secretary of the Xiangyang District Committee of the CPC in Hubei Province, recently personally presided over an "on-site meeting" in Huopai Key Township, Jianggou District, Xiangyang County, to promote the experience of the Huopai Township Party Branch in specifically implementing the Party's policies in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the "three fix" (三定) work for grain. The participants in the meeting included: the District Committee Secretaries and some District Committee members of Xiangyang County, as well as the Township Branch Secretaries and agricultural cooperative chairmen of Jianggou District, more than 100 people in total. At the meeting, Gao Jinlong, Secretary of the Huopai Township Branch and Chairman of the Xianggao Agricultural Cooperative, reported on their cooperative's experience in improving the use and feeding system of draft cattle; Li Hongjun, Chairman of the Second Cooperative of the Xianghuo Agricultural Cooperative, reported on their cooperative's experience in promoting the contract system; Zhang Jiujun, accountant of the Xianggao Agricultural Cooperative, introduced the experience in the financial management of agricultural cooperatives; and Zhang Runlan, Secretary of the Nanwang Township Branch, introduced the situation of their township in implementing the "three fix" policy. Then, a lively discussion was launched. Everyone unanimously believed: "Holding such a meeting neither delays production nor solves problems." After the meeting, the District Committees of Xiangyang County all studied the leadership method of holding on-site meetings to disseminate work experience in a timely manner. At present, this leadership method has begun to be widely promoted in the county and district Party organizations of the Xiangyang Special District. (Gao Changren)
    Holding Lectures on Basic Party Knowledge
    In order to meet the urgent needs of Communist Party members and non-Party masses to learn basic Party knowledge, the Party branch of the Xinhua Printing Factory in Jiangsu Province, after active preparation, formally held lectures on "Communism and the Communist Party" in April this year. The teaching material used in this lecture is the Party Constitution textbook of the former North China Bureau Party School, which is divided into fifteen lessons. The nearly one hundred students participating in the lecture began the first lesson, "The Nature of the Party," on April 17. The lecture is expected to end in December. (Yu Shide)

    各地党组织的活动
    领导农民打草保畜
    去年，河北省满城县大册营区的大部分村庄都遭到了灾害，今年这些村子的牲口饲料十分缺乏，许多牲畜因此逐渐瘦弱，严重地影响农副业生产的开展。
    为了解决这一问题，区委负责工作人员即深入各村了解情况，区委副书记王洛贵在神星村发现张洛头等三户农民生活并不富裕，牲口却喂得很壮，仔细一问才知道他们用苦荬叶草喂牲口，这种草在春天是营养很好的牲口饲料。王洛贵立即在该村张洛达领导的农业社社务委员会会议上介绍了这个经验。为了不误春耕，社务委员会马上决定发动妇女、儿童打苦荬叶草，并确定了报酬的办法。接着向全体社员宣布了打草保畜计划，于是这个村的打草保畜工作就开始了。
    以后，区委即在全区普遍推广打苦荬叶草解决牲口饲料的办法。
    但是，问题来了，苦荬叶草较少，不能完全解决牲口的饲料，区委马上又召集各社饲养员和老农座谈，发现还有米口袋、小芦草等六种草也可以喂牲口，这样就解决了饲料不足的问题。这时又产生了另外一个问题，很多社由于用现钱买草，负担很重，区委和支部又领导各社对社员进行了“爱社保畜，实现增产”的教育，除生活特殊困难的社员打了草付现钱外，一般社员打的草即按价作为向社里的投资，秋后归还。这些问题解决以后，全区的打草保畜运动就顺利展开了。到五月初，已打草三十六万九千斤，二千多头牲口的瘦弱状况大为好转，二百多头不能生产的牲口也恢复生产了。（中共满城县委办公室通讯组）
    关心工人群众的生活
    武汉市第四工程公司第一工区四二○工段的党组织和行政，过去对工人的生活福利很不关心。工人的伙食不好，还常吃生饭；工人也没有正当的文化生活，不少工人看荒诞淫秽神怪小说；或者在外边玩到深夜才回家，第二天常常误工，严重地影响了基本建设任务的完成。
    四月间工段党组织召开了党、政、工、团的干部会议，研究了改善工人生活和文化娱乐活动的办法。接着支部书记刘华云就召集炊事人员座谈，说明改善伙食对提高工人生产积极性的意义，并引导大家展开了批评和自我批评，批判了炊事员之间不团结、不安心工作等现象，最后并确定了改进的具体办法。以后伙食很快就有了改进，工人们都很满意，他们说：“现在花钱少，吃得好，劳动竞赛的劲头也大了。”
    为了保证工人有充分的休息时间和正当的文娱活动，支部通过工会督促工人们一定要午睡，还领导大家开展了篮、排球运动和游园活动，进行了卫生大扫除。医务室也进行了破伤风及其他疾病的预防注射，以防止疾病的发生。
    以后，支部又加强了宣传党的政策和时事的鼓动工作，鼓舞职工开展劳动竞赛的热情。职工的生产情绪显著提高了，如木工原只能完成定额百分之五十，现在已达到定额的百分之一百二十五，四月上旬和中旬都超额完成了生产计划。（蒋光明）
    交流经验的“现场会议”
    中共湖北省襄阳地委的地委书记赵修，最近在襄阳县姜沟区伙牌重点乡亲自主持召开了一次“现场会议”，来推广伙牌乡党支部在互助合作运动和粮食“三定”工作中具体贯彻党的政策的经验。参加这次会议的有：襄阳县各区区委书记和一部分区委委员，还有姜沟区各乡支部书记、农业社长等一百多人。会上，由伙牌乡支部书记、襄郜农业社社长郜金龙报告了他们社里改进耕牛的使用和饲养制度的经验；襄伙农业社第二社社长李洪钧报告了他们社内推行包工制的经验；襄郜农业社会计张久钧介绍了关于农业社财务管理工作的经验；还有南王乡支部书记张润澜介绍了他们乡里贯彻“三定”政策的情况。接着，又展开了热烈的讨论。大家一致认为：“开这样的会，既不耽误生产，又解决问题。”会后，襄阳县各区区委都学习了召开现场会议及时传播工作经验的领导方法。目前，这种领导方法已开始在襄阳专区县区党组织中普遍推行。（高长任）
    举办党的基本知识讲座
    江苏省新华印刷厂的党支部，为了满足共产党员和非党群众学习党的基本知识的迫切要求，经过积极筹备，在今年四月份正式举办了“共产主义与共产党”讲座。这个讲座采用的教材是前华北局党校的党章教材等，共分十五课，参加讲座的近百名学员在四月十七日已开始了第一课“党的性质”的报告，这个讲座预计在十二月份结束。（余世德）
