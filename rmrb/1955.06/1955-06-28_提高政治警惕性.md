    Enhance Political Vigilance

      The "People's Daily" published "The Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," further proving that Hu Feng and his gang were a group of counter-revolutionary elements closely related to imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The materials prove that this group of counter-revolutionary elements included imperialist and Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, turncoats, and defectors. The materials also prove that this group of counter-revolutionary elements, long ago disguised themselves as revolutionaries and progressive writers, infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, and after the national liberation, they used even more insidious and cunning double-dealing tactics to infiltrate government organs, troops, factories, schools, newspapers, people's organizations, and even the Chinese Communist Party in various regions and from various aspects. They were organized, planned, had a program, and systematically burrowed into our hearts to carry out counter-revolutionary activities.
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has consistently hated the revolution. They were "full of optimism" about the nationwide counter-revolutionary civil war launched by the Chiang bandit gang in July 1946. They hoped that the Chiang bandit gang could "defeat" the main revolutionary forces in "three months" and "eliminate" them in "one year." They believed that the revolution was "pus" that "must be discharged," and that it was a matter of "one for all, all for one." When the revolution triumphed and the people of the whole country rejoiced, these reactionary elements prepared to "meet suffering." They cursed the revolution, hoping that the revolution would "die a miserable death," but it was not the revolution that "died a miserable death," but their masters and themselves.
    Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique openly opposed the Party's literary and art policies, opposed Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and hated the cultural heritage of the motherland and the patriotism of the people. They opposed the new teaching methods, slandering the new teaching methods as "completely unnecessary to use the brain," and slandered professors for promoting the cultural heritage of the motherland as a "retrogressive" tendency, as "disguised promotion of 'Oriental spiritual civilization'," and as "wanting to become mummies." They hated "everyone," hated "this social order." Obviously, they were attempting to restore the old social order and enable the imperialist lackey, Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, to restore their rule in China.
    The emergence of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was not accidental. As early as 1949, Chairman Mao taught us in his opening address to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will make a final struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disturbance in various ways, and they will attempt to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable, without a doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance." The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is one of the organized counter-revolutionary organizations of those imperialists and domestic reactionaries who are not reconciled to their defeat. This can be proved by the fact that their activities were praised by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
    From the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we should learn a great lesson, that is, in the great movement of our socialist transformation and socialist construction, counter-revolutionary elements will inevitably step up their sabotage activities. After the national liberation, counter-revolutionary elements no longer dared to act openly and blatantly, and they must be hidden; because they must be hidden, they must be double-dealers. The materials tell us that these hidden counter-revolutionary elements, on the one hand, pretend to be active, "do not shirk," "do not remain silent," "do not complain to anyone," and on the other hand, they secretly plot and prepare their so-called "difficult and long-term" counter-revolutionary activities.
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has been exposed; but as the "People's Daily" editorial said: "If the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique could infiltrate our ranks, even infiltrate the Communist Party, why can't other counter-revolutionary elements use similar double-dealing tactics as Hu Feng to hide in our organs, troops, schools, factories, mines, people's organizations, and democratic parties? It should be said that they will inevitably infiltrate, and there is already material to prove that they have infiltrated in many places."
    To continue to expose Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique members and other hidden double-dealing counter-revolutionary elements similar to Hu Feng is the responsibility of every patriotic person. To expose these hidden double-dealers, we must enhance our political vigilance, enhance our level of Marxism-Leninism, and enhance our ability to distinguish between hidden double-dealing counter-revolutionary elements. In order to guarantee socialist construction, we must learn to fight against hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and we must thoroughly smash all hidden double-dealing counter-revolutionary elements, first and foremost, thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

    提高政治警惕性
    翦伯赞
      “人民日报”发表的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”，进一步证明了胡风和他的一伙是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的一群反革命分子。材料证明，这一群反革命分子，其中有帝国主义和国民党特务，反动军官，托洛茨基分子，革命叛徒，自首变节分子等等。材料又证明这一群反革命分子，很早以前就伪装革命，伪装进步作家，混进革命队伍的内部，而在全国解放以后，则以更阴险更狡猾的两面派的手法，在各个地区，从各个方面混进了政府机关、部队、工厂、学校、报馆、人民团体乃至中国共产党，他们有组织、有计划、有纲领、有步骤地钻进我们的肝脏里进行反革命活动。
    胡风反革命集团，一贯地仇视革命，他们对一九四六年七月蒋匪帮所发动的全国范围的反革命内战“充满了乐观”，他们希望蒋匪帮“三个月可以击破”革命的主力，“一年肃清”。他们认为革命是“脓”，“总要排出”，“一不做，二不休”。革命胜利，全国人民欢欣鼓舞，而这些反动分子则准备“迎接苦难”，他们诅咒革命，希望革命“呜呼完蛋”，但“呜呼完蛋”的不是革命，而是他们的主子和他们自己。
    胡风及其反革命集团公开地反对党的文艺政策，反对毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，而且仇视祖国的文化遗产，仇视人民群众的爱国主义，他们反对新的教学法，诬蔑新的教学法“完全可以不用脑袋”，诬蔑教授们宣扬祖国文化遗产是“‘复古’的倾向”，是“变相的鼓吹着‘东方精神文明’”，是“要变成木乃伊”，他们恨“一切人”，恨“这个社会秩序”，很显然，他们是在妄图恢复旧的社会秩序，使帝国主义走狗蒋匪帮在中国复辟。
    胡风反革命集团的出现不是偶然的。毛主席早在一九四九年中国人民政治协商会议开幕词中就教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”胡风反革命集团，正是那些不甘心于失败的帝国主义者和国内反动派的有组织的反革命组织之一。关于这一点，可以从他们的活动获得蒋匪帮的赞美得到证明。
    从胡风反革命集团的暴露，我们应该受到很大的教训，即在我们社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大运动中，反革命分子必然加紧进行破坏活动。在全国解放以后，反革命分子已经不敢明目张胆地活动，必然是暗藏的；因为要暗藏，就必然是两面派的。材料告诉我们，这些暗藏的反革命分子，他们一方面假装积极，“不推托”，“不沉默”，“不对任何人发什么牢骚”，另一方面便阴谋暗算准备他们的所谓“坚苦性和长期性”的反革命活动。
    胡风反革命集团算是被揭露了；但正如“人民日报”社论所说：“如果胡风反革命集团能够混到我们的队伍中来，甚至混到共产党的队伍中来，为什么别的反革命分子不能用类似胡风的两面派手法，暗藏在我们的机关、部队、学校、工矿、人民团体和民主党派中呢？应该说，他们必然会混进来，而且已有材料证明在许多地方已经混进来了。”
    继续揭露胡风及其反革命集团分子和类似胡风的其他的暗藏的两面派的反革命分子，是每一个爱国人民的责任。而要揭露这些暗藏的两面派，就必须提高我们的政治警惕性，提高我们的马克思列宁主义的水平，提高我们对于暗藏的两面派的反革命分子的辨别能力。为了保证社会主义的建设，我们要学会同暗藏的反革命分子作斗争，我们要彻底粉碎一切暗藏的两面派的反革命分子，首先是彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团。（原载“北京日报”）
