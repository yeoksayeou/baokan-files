    Western European Workers Struggle to Defend Their Living Rights
    British Railway Workers' Strike Continues to Expand
    Xinhua News Agency, London, May 31st: The strike of over 70,000 British engine drivers and stokers, which began on the 29th, is continuing.
    British industry has begun to feel the effects of this strike. Agence France-Presse reported on the 30th that the strike "threatens to plunge the entire industrial life of Britain into a widespread paralysis. The coal, steel, and transportation industries are the most affected." A steel industry spokesperson said that if the strike continues, many steel factories will have to reduce production or even shut down because they cannot ship their products.
    On the 31st, British Prime Minister Eden requested the Queen to convene a Privy Council meeting to grant the government "emergency powers" and declare a "state of emergency" to "deal with" the situation caused by the strike.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 1st, TASS dispatch from London: The strike of over 70,000 British engine drivers and stokers is continuing to expand, with an increasing number of railway workers who do not belong to the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF), the union that initiated the strike, also participating. According to newspaper reports, in Scotland, 90 percent of the drivers and stokers belonging to the National Union of Railwaymen have joined the strike.
    The strike has brought passenger and postal services to a standstill and has severely paralyzed freight transport. British national railways normally carry three million passengers and over one million tons of goods daily, but this has been greatly reduced. In London, normally 500 trains run between London and nearby cities every day, but on May 31st only 20 to 30 trains were running.
    On May 31st, the Queen signed an order declaring a state of emergency in Britain due to the railway workers' strike. According to this order, the British government can take any measures it deems necessary. Newspapers predict that the government's initial measures will be to requisition private cars to transport passengers, mail, and food. Some reports say that the government may also use the military to ensure transportation.
    In response to a question from a United Press reporter about the strikers' reaction to the declaration of a state of emergency, ASLEF Assistant General Secretary Hallworth said: "They are determined to fight to the end."
    Due to the declaration of a state of emergency, the parliamentary session, originally scheduled to begin on June 14th, will be brought forward to June 9th. The Press Association points out that it is unprecedented in British political history for the meeting of a newly elected parliament to be brought forward in this way.
    Italian Agricultural Workers Strike, Teachers Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, May 31st, Rome: Approximately two million agricultural workers in Italy held a 48-hour general strike on May 30th and 31st, demanding increased wages and the same rights as industrial workers. This is the second general strike held by Italian agricultural workers in May. As early as May 9th, two million agricultural workers in Italy held a 24-hour general strike to demand that employers comply with cultivation contracts and expand the social insurance system.
    The teachers' strike movement, which began on the 28th, has reached a significant scale. According to materials from the "United Front of Italian Schools" (a federation of school staff unions), approximately 90 percent of teachers nationwide are participating in the strike, and in many cities, 100 percent of teachers have joined the strike.
    According to "l'Unità" (Unity), workers in the entire metallurgical sector of the Livorno province held a strike in support of the working people of Piombino in the Livorno province, who held a 24-hour strike on the 28th. The Piombino workers went on strike to protest the firing of eight workers who participated in the strike movement by the ILVA steel factory.
    French Working Class Expands Unified Action
    Xinhua News Agency, May 31st, TASS dispatch from Paris: According to "l'Humanité" (Humanity), despite strong opposition from the Socialist Party leadership, the united action of Communists and Socialists is growing. Representatives of many local Communist and Socialist Party organizations have reached agreements on issues such as fighting for higher wages, opposing atomic weapons and arms expansion, and defending non-religious schools. Organizations of the two parties in Saint-Denis (Seine), La Palisse, La Rochelle, Saint-Romain-de-Benet (Charente-Inférieure) and other towns have recently reached such agreements. Communists and Socialists also often hold joint meetings to discuss unified action. It is also common for Communists and Socialists to speak jointly in many municipal councils.
    Achievements have also been made in establishing united action in the trade union system. Members of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), "Force Ouvrière" (Workers' Force), and the "French Confederation of Christian Workers" (CFTC) often participate in strikes together. "l'Humanité" reported that workers from various unions in the Pamiers (Ariège) metallurgical factory
  unanimously opposed the dismissal of several colleagues. Bank employees belonging to the aforementioned unions also participated together in the struggle to improve living conditions. Preparations are currently underway throughout France for a joint conference of public utility workers. The conference is scheduled to be held in Paris on June 4th, with the participation of members of the CGT, "Force Ouvrière," and various independent unions, as well as non-unionized employees.

    西欧国家工人为维护生活权利而斗争
    英国铁路工人罢工继续扩大
    新华社三十一日讯　伦敦消息：从二十九日开始的英国七万多名机车司机司炉工人的大罢工仍在继续进行。
    英国工业系统已经开始受到这一罢工的影响。法新社三十日消息说，这一罢工“有使英国的全部工业生活陷于普遍蔓延的瘫痪状态之势。煤、钢和运输工业受到的影响最大”。一位钢铁工业的发言人说，如果罢工继续下去，许多钢铁工厂都将由于产品运不出去而不得不减少生产，甚至停工。
    三十一日，英国首相艾登请求英国女王召开枢密院会议以便授予政府以“紧急权力”并宣布“紧急状态”，来“对付”罢工所引起的局势。
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国七万多名机车司机司炉工人的罢工在继续扩大，许多不属于发起这一罢工的英国机车司机司炉联合会的铁路工人也越来越多地参加了这一罢工。据报纸消息，在苏格兰，属于全国铁路工人工会的司机司炉工人有百分之九十参加了这一罢工。
    罢工使得客运和邮政都停顿了，货运工作陷于严重的瘫痪状态。英国全国铁路平常每天要载运三百万旅客和一百多万吨货物，现在已大大减少。在伦敦，平常每天有五百列火车来往行驶于伦敦和附近的城市之间，而五月三十一日只有二十列到三十列火车在行驶。
    五月三十一日，英国女王签署了关于由于铁路员工罢工而在英国宣布紧急状态的命令。根据这一命令，英国政府可以采取它认为必要的任何措施。据报纸预测，政府的初步措施将是征用私人汽车来运载乘客、邮件和粮食。有些消息说，政府也可能使用军队来保证运输工作。
    机车司机司炉联合会助理总书记霍尔华特在答复新闻联合社记者提出的关于罢工者对宣布紧急状态的反应如何的问题时说：“他们决心把斗争进行到底。”
    由于宣布紧急状态，原定在六月十四日开始的议会会议，将提前在六月九日举行。据新闻联合社指出，新选出的议会的会议像这样提前举行，在英国政治史上是没有先例的。
    意农业工人罢工教师罢教
    新华社三十一日讯　罗马消息：意大利约有二百万农业工人在五月三十日和三十一日举行四十八小时总罢工，要求增加工资和给他们以同工业企业工人同等的权利。这是五月份内意大利农业工人举行的第二次总罢工。早在五月九日，意大利的二百万农业工人，就曾经为要求雇主遵守耕种契约、扩大社会保险制度，举行了一次二十四小时的总罢工。
    二十八日开始的教师罢教运动已经达到很大的规模。据“意大利学校统一阵线”（各校教职员工会联合会）的材料，意大利全国参加罢教的教师约占全国教师的百分之九十，在许多城市，百分之百的教师都参加了罢教。
    据“团结报”报道，里窝那省的全省冶金企业工作人员举行了罢工，支持里窝那省皮奥宾诺城的劳动人民在二十八日举行的二十四小时罢工。皮奥宾诺城工人罢工，是为了抗议伊尔瓦钢铁工厂解雇八个参加罢工运动的工人。
    法国工人阶级扩大一致行动
    新华社三十一日讯　据塔斯社巴黎三十日讯：据“人道报”消息，不顾社会党领导机构的激烈反对，共产党人和社会党人的一致行动正在日益扩大。共产党和社会党许多地方组织的代表在争取提高工资、反对原子武器和扩充军备以及保卫非教会学校等问题上取得了协议。圣但尼（塞纳省）、拉帕利斯、拉罗歇尔、圣罗门德本（下夏朗德省）和其他市镇的两党组织最近都取得了这种协议。共产党人和社会党人还常常联合开会讨论一致行动问题。在许多市议会里，共产党人和社会党人联合发言也是常有的事。
    在工会系统，在建立一致行动方面也取得了成就。法国总工会、“工人力量”和“天主教劳工联盟”的会员常常一起参加罢工。“人道报”报道说：帕米耶（阿列埃依省）冶金工厂各工会的工人
  一致反对解雇几个同事。参加上述工会的银行职员也一同参加了争取改善生活条件的斗争。在法国各地，目前正在为公用事业机关工作人员联合大会进行筹备工作。这次大会订于六月四日在巴黎举行，参加大会的有总工会、“工人力量”和各独立工会的会员以及没有参加工会的职员。
