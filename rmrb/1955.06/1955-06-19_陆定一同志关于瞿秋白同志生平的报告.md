Comrades!

    Today is the 20th anniversary of the martyrdom of Comrade Qu Qiubai. We have chosen this day to bury his remains and express our deep mourning and respect for him.

    Comrade Qu Qiubai was an outstanding political activist and propagandist of the Chinese Communist Party. He was born in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, on January 29, 1899.

    In 1920, Comrade Qu Qiubai visited Soviet Russia as a journalist. He was one of the earliest Chinese progressive intellectuals to introduce this socialist country. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1922 and attended the Far Eastern National Congress and the Fourth Congress of the Communist International in Moscow in the same year. In 1923, at the Third National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Party.

    During the First Domestic Revolutionary War from 1924 to 1927, Comrade Qu Qiubai, together with Comrades Mao Zedong, Ren Bishi, and others, waged a resolute struggle to uphold the Party's correct policy on the united front, refuted the anti-Soviet and anti-communist fallacies of the bourgeois right wing, and also criticized the right-leaning opportunist errors represented by Chen Duxiu within the Party, which abandoned the leadership of the proletariat. At the most critical juncture of the Chinese revolution in 1927, he, together with other comrades, presided over the emergency meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on August 7, criticized right-leaning opportunism, and determined the correct policy of land revolution and armed resistance against the counter-revolutionary rule of the Kuomintang. At this meeting, he was elected Secretary of the CPC Central Committee. At the Sixth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1928, he was re-elected as a member of the Central Committee. After the meeting, he attended the Sixth Congress of the Communist International in Moscow and was elected as a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and a member of the Presidium. In 1930, he returned to China, and in September of the same year, he presided over the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, correcting the errors of the adventurous line of the Party's leading organs at that time.

    From 1931 to 1933, Comrade Qu Qiubai led the left-wing cultural movement in Shanghai together with Mr. Lu Xun. During this period, he devoted himself to introducing Marxist literary and artistic theories and Russian and Soviet literary and artistic works, making important contributions to China's revolutionary cultural movement.

    In 1933, Comrade Qu Qiubai entered the central revolutionary base area centered on southern Jiangxi Province and western Fujian Province, serving as the People's Education Commissioner of the Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government. On February 23, 1935, he was arrested by the Kuomintang bandit army in Wuping County, Fujian Province, and heroically gave his life at 10:00 am on June 18 in Ximenwai, Changting County, Fujian Province.

    Comrade Qu Qiubai was an infinitely loyal fighter of the Chinese proletariat. He dedicated himself to the revolution until his last breath. His noble qualities and lifelong achievements will live in the hearts of the people and will be immortal.
