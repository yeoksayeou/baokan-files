Since Kongfang Township in Liangshan County, Shandong Province, rectified the unified sales work in mid-April, the grain supply situation has gradually stabilized. The daily sales volume of grain has decreased from 22,000 jin before the rectification to 5,000 jin, and has remained stable within the scope of the national supply plan indicators.

In mid-May, I visited Fanzhuang Village in this township. I found that the improvement of grain unified sales work here not only saved the state the grain that could be saved, but also caused changes in people's thinking.

Fanzhuang Village has 104 households. In the period before the rectification of grain unified sales work, 89 households reported grain shortages and requested state supply. Many farmers delayed production in order to find the village head to get grain purchase certificates and queue up to buy grain. Wang Baochun, the head of an agricultural cooperative, recalled the situation at that time and said, "The more surplus grain households had, the louder they shouted about grain shortages." A farmer named Fan Taihui, who was originally a surplus grain household, instructed his wife and son to ask the village head for a grain purchase certificate. However, everyone knew that he was not short of grain, so the village head did not issue him a grain purchase certificate. His son went home and said bluntly, "We are not short of grain, so will they give it to us?" But Fan Taihui said, "We still have to ask for it! If you don't ask, people will say I have surplus grain." Surplus grain households Fan Pingben, Hou Zhaoxiang, and others also requested state supply.

How can the grain purchase requirements of farmers be met? Fan Pinghuan, the township head of Kongfang Township, who lives in Fanzhuang, originally thought that increasing the supply would ease the situation; but after the supply was increased at the request of township and village staff, even more people requested supply. Later, during the rectification of grain unified sales work, it was found that among the 89 households that requested supply, 38 were surplus grain households and self-sufficient households. Facts have proved that as long as the supply is carried out in accordance with the national policy, ensuring the supply of everything that must be supplied, and striving to reduce the parts that can be supplied less or not supplied at all to achieve rationality, farmers will eliminate misunderstandings about the grain unified sales policy. The result of the rectification of grain unified sales work in Fanzhuang Village was: from April to before the wheat harvest, only 51 households truly needed supply, and the supply plan was also reduced from 32,640 jin to 1,714 jin. In this way, the grain needs of grain-deficient households were guaranteed; and surplus grain households and self-sufficient households also felt it was reasonable.

This change was achieved through hard work by mobilizing the masses and conscientiously implementing the unified sales policy. At the beginning of the rectification of unified sales work, the township's Party organization and staff first widely and deeply publicized the state's grain policy and the principle of saving grain to support national construction, dispelling the concerns of some farmers and raising their awareness. At the village's general meeting, many people automatically reported the actual figures of their supply requirements according to the actual situation. Hou Zhaoxiang, a surplus grain household who originally requested the state to supply grain, said at the meeting: "In the past, I saw that everyone else was asking for grain, so I asked for it too. Even if I don't eat it now, it's good to keep it for later use. Now that I think about it, since the state implemented the unified purchase and sales of grain, not only has it not let us go hungry, but even grain-deficient households don't eat expensive grain anymore. I shouldn't have taken advantage of the situation to steal the rice bowls of grain-deficient households and disrupt the state's plan for supplying grain." He returned the 250 jin of grain he had bought in excess on the spot. Zhang Deyin, a surplus grain household, not only returned his grain purchase certificate after listening to the policy explanation, but also sold 127 jin of surplus grain. Many truly grain-deficient farmers who received supplies believed that the rectification of grain unified sales work was very reasonable. Grain-deficient farmer Fan Huaizhong said: "Whoever is short of grain buys it, whenever you need it, you buy it, and no one mixes together and shouts that there is not enough grain, how reasonable this is!"

The grain unified sales work in Fanzhuang Village thus began to embark on a normal track. The day after the general meeting summarizing the rectification of unified sales work and arranging production was held, three agricultural production cooperatives and two mutual aid teams in the village mobilized 45 people to dig the bay mud that had not been dug for decades and could be used as fertilizer. This year, the village's average yield per mu can be increased by two more carts of fertilizer than in previous years. All four agricultural production cooperatives and two mutual aid teams in the village actively launched production activities such as digging wells for irrigation and replanting seedlings.

    梁山县樊庄村整顿粮食统销工作前后
    李树真
    山东省梁山县孔坊乡自从四月中旬整顿了统销工作以后，粮食供应的情况逐步稳定。粮食日销数量已从整顿前的二万二千斤降低到五千斤，而且一直稳定在国家供应计划指标的范围以内。
    五月中旬，我曾访问了这个乡的樊庄村。我发现这里粮食统销工作的改善，不仅为国家节省下了可以节省的粮食，而且引起了人们思想上的变化。
    樊庄村有一百零四户居民，在整顿粮食统销工作前的一个时期，曾经有八十九户居民自报缺粮，要求国家供应。不少农民为了找村长要购粮证和排队买粮而耽误了生产。一个农业合作社的社长王保存回忆当时的情况说：“越是余粮户，喊叫缺粮越凶。”有一个叫樊太会的农民，本来是余粮户，却指使他的老婆和儿子向村长要购粮证。可是，谁都知道他不缺粮，村长也就没有发给他购粮证。他儿子回家很爽直地说：“俺本不缺粮，人家就给俺了吗？”但樊太会说：“还得要！你不要，人家会说我有余粮的。”余粮户樊平本、侯兆祥等也都要求国家供应。
    怎么才能满足农民购粮的要求呢？家住在樊庄的孔坊乡乡长樊平环，原来认为增加了供应量，情况就能够缓和；但在乡、村工作人员的要求下供应量一度增加之后，要求供应的人反而多起来了。后来，在整顿粮食统销工作中查明，原来要求供应的八十九户中，有三十八户是余粮户和粮食自给户。事实证明，只要按照国家的政策进行供应，做到一切必须供应的都保证供应，一切可以少供应或不供应的部分都力求缩减做到合理，农民就会消除对粮食统销政策的误解。樊庄村整顿粮食统销工作的结果是：从四月到麦收前，真正需要供应的只有五十一户，供应计划也由三万二千六百四十斤降低到一千七百一十四斤。这样，缺粮户的粮食需要得到了保证；余粮户和自给户也认为合理了。
    这一变化，是经过发动群众、认真贯彻统销政策的艰苦努力而得来的。在开始整顿统销工作的时候，乡的党组织和工作人员首先广泛、深入地宣传了国家的粮食政策和节约粮食支援国家建设的道理，打破了某些农民的顾虑，提高了农民的觉悟。在全村的群众大会上，许多人自动按实际情况报实了要求供应的数字。原来要求国家供应粮食的余粮户侯兆祥在大会上说：“以前我看人家都要粮，我也就要。即便现在吃不着，留着以后用也好。现在一想，自从国家实行粮食统购统销以后，不光没让俺饿着，就是缺粮户也不吃贵粮了。俺不该钻空子夺人家缺粮户的饭碗，打乱国家供应粮食的计划。”他当场就退还了多买的二百五十斤粮食。余粮户张得银，听了讲解政策以后，不仅退回了购粮证，还卖出了一百二十七斤余粮。很多得到供应的真正缺粮的农民认为整顿粮食统销工作很合理。缺粮农民樊怀中说：“谁缺谁买，啥时候要啥时候买，也没有人混在一块嚷着说粮食不够了，这多合理！”
    樊庄村的粮食统销工作就是这样开始走上了正常的轨道。在总结整顿统销工作和布置生产的大会开过的第二天，全村就有三个农业生产合作社和两个互助组发动了四十五人，去挖几十年来没有人挖的可以用做肥料的湾泥，今年全村平均每亩地能够比往年多上两车肥。全村四个农业生产合作社和两个互助组，都积极展开了打井浇地、补苗等生产活动。
