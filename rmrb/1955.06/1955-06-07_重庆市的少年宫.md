    Chongqing's Children's Palace

    Chongqing's Children's Palace was completed before International Children's Day on June 1st. The Children's Palace has basketball courts, tennis courts, and a large lawn for thousands of children to play on. There is a fountain in the goldfish pond in the center of the lawn, and the surrounding hillsides are planted with flowers and trees.

    The Children's Palace is divided into four departments: Science and Technology, Literature and Art, Military Sports, and Young Pioneers Work. Each department is divided into several groups. Each group has instructors to guide the children's activities. The children of Chongqing can participate in physical science, chemistry, literature, painting, dance, instrumental music, singing, aviation modeling, sports and other group activities here in an organized way and according to their own interests.

    Upstairs to the right of the Children's Palace gate is a spacious reading room with thousands of children's books, like a key that will open the treasure house of science and culture for the children and enable them to acquire various scientific knowledge. Walking through the gate, passing a semicircular stone path, you enter a four-story building. The white walls and green doors and windows are beautiful and simple. This building is mainly used as an exhibition room for children. Now, it displays more than 600 scientific, technological, and craft exhibits created by children under the age of fifteen through their own labor and wisdom. These exhibits are all made by children under the age of fifteen. There are all kinds of crane, warship, airplane, skydiving tower, train and other models, small radios, slide projectors, and exquisite embroidery.

    Entering from the side door of the exhibition room, walking through a suspended open-air corridor, you will reach another building. In this building, the Military Sports Department, the Science and Technology Department, and the Young Pioneers Work Department of the Children's Palace have prepared nine rooms for the members of each group, including chemistry, physics, aviation modeling, and the Young Pioneers. The aviation modeling room is the most interesting. On a large square table is a model of an airport, which perfectly has the hangars, waiting rooms, radio stations, office buildings and other facilities that an airport should have; in the runway and the sky above the airport, many airplanes are taking off and landing. The aviation modeling room is equipped with an exhibition room, a studio and a sawing room, allowing children who are aspiring to be future aviators of the motherland to carry out activities of making various aviation models here.

    Chemical instruments, human models, and animal, plant, and mineral specimens are placed in the chemistry, physics, and biology rooms. Children will conduct scientific experiments here.

    On the hillside shaded by greenery and blooming with flowers, there is a small building. This is specially prepared by the Literature and Art Department for members of painting and other groups. The environment here is quiet and the scenery is beautiful, making it most suitable for young artists to conceive and find scenery.

    All the houses in the Children's Palace were allocated by the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee. All the equipment in the palace was donated by various units. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee sent pianos to the children; the Chongqing Municipal Company of the Sichuan Provincial Company of China Chemical Raw Material Corporation sent a lot of chemical medicines for the children; the worker uncles of the Chongqing Cotton Textile Factory sent various small sportswear of different colors, and the sportswear also had patterns specially designed by these worker uncles for the children; the Chongqing People's Publishing House donated 110 volumes of books for teenagers. More than 400 gifts have been sent from all over the place.

    重庆市的少年宫
    沈志钧
    重庆市的少年宫在“六一”国际儿童节前建成了。少年宫内有篮球场、网球场，有可供几千人游玩的大草坪。草坪中央的金鱼池内有喷泉，草坪周围山坡上栽满了鲜花和树木。
    少年宫分科学技术、文学艺术、军事体育、少年先锋队工作等四部，各部下面分设若干小组。每个小组都聘有指导员指导孩子们活动。重庆市的少年儿童们可以有组织地、按照自己的爱好在这里参加物理、化学、文学、绘画、舞蹈、器乐、歌咏、航空模型、体育等小组活动。
    少年宫大门靠右边的楼上有一间宽敞的阅览室，室内几千本儿童读物，像一把把的钥匙，将为孩子们打开科学、文化的宝库，使他们获得各种科学知识。走进大门，经过一条半圆形的石板路，便进入一幢四层楼的大厦。洁白的墙壁，绿色的门窗，显得美观、朴实。这座房子主要是作为儿童们的展览室用的。现在，里面陈列着六百多件儿童们用自己的劳动和智慧创造出来的科学、技术、工艺展览品。这些展览品都是十五岁以下的儿童制作的。有各式各样的起重机、军舰、飞机、航空跳伞塔、火车等模型，有小型收音机、幻灯机，还有精致的刺绣。
    从展览室的侧门进去，走过一条悬空的露天走廊，便到了另一座大楼。在这座大楼里，少年宫的军事体育部、科学技术部和少年先锋队工作部为各小组的组员们准备了化学、物理、航空模型、少年先锋队等九个室。航空模型室最使人感到兴趣。一张大方桌上放着一座飞机场的模型，它完美地具备了一个飞机场应有的机库、候机室、电台、办公大楼等设备；在机场的跑道和上空，许多飞机正在升降。航空模型室附设有陈列室、工作室和锯木机房，让有志作祖国未来航空家的孩子们在这里展开制作各种航空模型的活动。
    在化学、物理、生物室内放着化学仪器，人体模型和动物、植物、矿物标本。孩子们将在这里进行科学实验工作。
    在绿荫遮蔽、鲜花盛开的山坡上，有一座小楼房。这是文学艺术部特为绘画等小组组员准备的。这里环境恬静，风景优美，最适合小画家们构思和取景。
    少年宫的全部房屋是重庆市人民委员会拨给的。宫内的设备也全是各单位赠送的。中共重庆市委员会和重庆市人民委员会给孩子们送来了钢琴；中国化工原料公司四川省公司重庆市公司为孩子们送来了不少种化学药品；重庆棉织厂的工人叔叔们送来了各种不同颜色的小运动服，运动服上还有这些工人叔叔们特为孩子们设计的图案；重庆市人民出版社赠送了青少年读物一百一十册。各处送来的礼品已有四百多件。
