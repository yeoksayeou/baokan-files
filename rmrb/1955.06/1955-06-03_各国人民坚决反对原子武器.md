    People of All Countries Resolutely Oppose Atomic Weapons
    Vietnam
    As of May 24, 5,465,444 people in northern Vietnam had signed the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World" opposing atomic warfare.
    The people of Vinh Linh district in Quang Tri province, near the provisional military demarcation line, have also sent their signatures to the Vietnamese Committee for the Signature Campaign Against Atomic Weapons.
    German Democratic Republic
    The signature campaign for the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World" in the German Democratic Republic ended on the 20th. A total of more than 12.5 million people signed the "Appeal to the People of the World," demonstrating the strong will of the people of the German Democratic Republic to oppose imperialist atomic war plans and safeguard world peace.
    Australia
    According to the Australian weekly "Tribune," the New South Wales Peace Council has collected 29,000 signatures against preparing for atomic warfare.
    Previously, the South Australian Peace Council announced that the vast majority of trade union leaders in South Australia had signed the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World."
    Italy
    The Italian National Peace Council announced that the number of people signing the "Appeal to the People of the World" issued in Vienna against preparing for atomic warfare continues to increase. In the four regions of Emilia, Lombardy, Tuscany, and Sicily alone, the number of signatures has reached more than 4,918,300. Currently, the signature campaign is still ongoing.
    The Secretariat of the Italian Socialist Party issued a statement calling on members to participate more actively in the signature campaign for the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World" against preparing for atomic warfare. The statement pointed out that the signature campaign should be used as a means to develop contact with the masses and organizations of the Christian Democratic Party. The statement concluded that, on the one hand, the recent Bandung Conference, the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty, and the news of the upcoming Four-Power Conference have opened up prospects for easing international tensions; on the other hand, pressure on Italy, aggressive Atlantic policies, and military preparations on Italian territory are intensifying. Both of these situations call on us to coordinate with this specific signature campaign to expand and develop the struggle for peace, and to take other similar measures on the broadest possible basis.
    France
    According to "l'Humanité," the 10th National Congress of the French National Federation of Veterans and Former Prisoners of War recently adopted a resolution advocating peaceful coexistence between countries, advocating faithful implementation of the Geneva Conference agreements on Indochina, opposing the arming of West Germany, and advocating that atomic energy be used only for peaceful purposes and the establishment of a collective security system. The Congress emphasized that universal and supervised disarmament is the best way to promote the establishment of such a system.
    The Executive Bureau of the National Association of Deported and Imprisoned Resistance Fighters and Patriots issued a declaration calling on all former deported and imprisoned resistance fighters and the families of those missing in World War II to unite and fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the peaceful resolution of international disputes.
    One hundred and seventeen of the 152 students at the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris jointly wrote a letter to the head of government, Edgar Faure, requesting that France's research work in the use of nuclear energy be entirely limited to peaceful purposes.

    各国人民坚决反对原子武器
    越南
    到五月二十四日止，越南北部地区已有五百四十六万五千四百四十四人在世界和平理事会的“告全世界人民书”上签名，反对原子战争。
    临时军事分界线附近的广治省永灵县人民也已经把他们的签名送给越南反对原子武器签名运动委员会。
    德意志民主共和国
    在德意志民主共和国进行的为世界和平理事会“告全世界人民书”征集签名的运动，已经在二十日结束。在“告全世界人民书”上签名的共有一千二百五十余万人，显示了德意志民主共和国人民反对帝国主义原子战争计划和维护世界和平的坚强意志。
    澳大利亚
    据澳大利亚周报“论坛”报道，新南威尔士和平理事会已经征集了二万九千个反对准备原子战争的签名。
    在这以前，南澳大利亚和平理事会宣布，南澳大利亚的工会领袖绝大多数已经在世界和平理事会
  “告全世界人民书”上签了名。
    意大利
    意大利全国和平理事会公布，在维也纳发出的反对准备原子战争的“告全世界人民书”上签名的人数继续增加。只在艾米利亚、伦巴第、杜斯坎尼和西西里四个区，签名人数已经达到四百九十一万八千三百余人。目前，征集签名的运动仍在继续进行中。
    意大利社会党书记处发表声明，号召党员更积极地参加为世界和平理事会反对准备原子战争的“告全世界人民书”征集签名的运动。声明指出，应当使征集签名的运动成为发展同天主教民主党的群众和组织的联系的手段。声明最后说，一方面，最近举行的万隆会议、奥地利国家条约的缔结和关于将要举行四国代表会议的消息打开了缓和国际紧张局势的前景；另一方面，对意大利的压力、侵略性的大西洋政策和在意大利领土上的军事准备正在日益加紧。这两方面的形势都唤醒我们要配合这次征集签名的具体运动，来扩大和发展争取和平的斗争，并在尽量广泛的基础上采取其他类似的措施。
    法国
    据“人道报”报道，最近举行的法国全国退伍军人和前战俘联合会第十届代表大会通过决议，主张各国和平共处，主张忠实执行日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的协定，反对武装西德，并且主张原子能只用于和平用途和建立集体安全体系。代表大会着重指出：普遍和有监督的裁军是能够促进建立这种体系的最好的方法。
    全国被放逐和被监禁的抵抗运动参加者和爱国者协会执行局发表宣言，号召所有以前被放逐和被监禁的抵抗运动参加者以及第二次世界大战失踪者的家人团结起来，为争取禁止原子武器和以和平方法解决国际争端而斗争。
    巴黎工业物理和化学高等学校一百五十二个学生中有一百一十七人联名写信给政府首脑埃加·富尔，要求法国在核子能使用方面的研究工作完全限于和平用途方面。                   （据新华社讯）
