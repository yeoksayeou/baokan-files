　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 21st. Vietnam News Agency reported: The Cambodian "Unity Newspaper" recently published many letters from readers protesting against the military "aid" agreement concluded between the United States and the Kingdom of Cambodia.
　　One reader wrote in a letter that the US imperialists are extending their bloody hands into Cambodia. They are constantly offering various kinds of "aid" to rebuild the Bangkok-Phnom Penh railway, build new roads to Laos and the Yunrang seaport, and increase the kingdom's troop numbers.
　　The purpose of all this "aid" is to seize control of the Cambodian army. On May 16th of this year, the US imperialists concluded a military "aid" agreement with the Kingdom's government: this news has made the Cambodian and world people very uneasy. They are increasingly clearly seeing the cunning conspiracy of the United States in Cambodia. Under these circumstances, all Cambodian people, regardless of social class, will, on the one hand, correctly implement the Geneva Accords, and on the other hand, demand that the United States respect Cambodia's peace and independence.

    柬埔寨人民反对美柬军事“援助”协定
    新华社河内二十一日电　越南通讯社报道：柬埔寨“团结报”最近刊载了许多读者来信，抗议美国同柬埔寨王国缔结的军事“援助”协定。
    有一个读者在信中写道，美帝国主义者正在把他的血手伸入柬埔寨。他们不断地拿出各种各样的“援助”，来重建曼谷—金边铁路，修建通向老挝的新公路和云壤海港，并且增加王国的兵额。
    所有这些“援助”的目的都是要夺取柬埔寨军队的控制权。今年五月十六日，美帝国主义者同王国政府缔结了一个军事“援助”协定：这个消息使柬埔寨和全世界人民感到十分不安，他们越来越清楚地看出美国在柬埔寨的狡猾阴谋。在这种情况下，全体柬埔寨人民，不分社会阶层，将一方面正确地执行日内瓦协议，另方面要求美国尊重柬埔寨的和平和独立。
