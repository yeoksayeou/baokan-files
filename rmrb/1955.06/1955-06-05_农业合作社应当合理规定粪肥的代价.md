Agricultural Cooperatives Should Reasonably Stipulate the Price of Manure
Zhong Jifu

In many agricultural production cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province, members are not actively accumulating manure; some elderly people who used to accumulate manure all year round before joining the cooperative now sit idle or wander around without accumulating manure; and in many villages, there is manure all over the streets but no one picks it up.

Why is this happening? The main reason is that some agricultural cooperatives have stipulated manure prices that are too low, and some individual cooperatives even take ownership of all manure without any compensation. The Zhangjiagang Village Agricultural Cooperative in Jianshanzi Village, Mingshui County, Heilongjiang Province, stipulates that the price of manure for one hectare of land is only counted as three workdays; the agricultural cooperative led by Zhong Weifu in Baiquan County gave only six workdays as compensation to a new member this spring who brought manure for four hectares of land. In this county, one hundred and thirty-five new cooperatives and five old cooperatives have taken ownership of the manure accumulated by members' families, but the price has not yet been determined.

Why are manure prices in agricultural cooperatives too low or even without compensation? The main reason is that some rural workers believe that high manure prices will reduce the amount of dividends per workday, and will not be able to "show the superiority of agricultural cooperatives." They say: If the manure price is not lower, how much will a workday be worth after deducting the manure price when distributing dividends in the fall! Some believe: "The meat rots in the pot, anyway, the increased production will be distributed to the members, it doesn't matter how much it is priced." Some say: "If the prices of vehicles, horses, and farm tools are unreasonable, adjustments will affect the emotions of the members. Manure is not a big deal, and not adjusting it will not affect production." Some workers and cooperative directors lack a sufficient understanding of the role of farmyard manure. They say: This stuff used to be more important; now that the country's industry has developed, we must use chemical fertilizers, which are both easier and more powerful. In some villages, manure is everywhere, but no one picks it up, while agricultural cooperatives spend a lot of money to buy manure from other places.

Will reasonably determining the price of manure reduce the income of members? Facts prove that only by reasonably stipulating the price of manure can the income of members be increased. Due to the unreasonable determination of manure prices, the area of fertilization in agricultural cooperatives has shown a decreasing trend. For example, in the Second Cooperative of Qunzhong Village, Fourteenth District, Hailun County, Heilongjiang, the area of fertilization accounted for 100% of the cultivated area in 1953, 80% in 1954, and decreased to 70% in 1955. How can this increase production? If production cannot be increased, where will the members' income increase from? Furthermore, the actual increase in the income of members should include all of their income. The manure price is precisely a part of the members' labor income. Setting a reasonable manure price will increase the income of those who accumulate more manure. Low manure prices or no pricing means allowing those who are unwilling to accumulate manure to encroach on the labor income of those who accumulate more manure. This is by no means a "not a big deal" trivial matter, nor does it not affect the emotions of the members. Liu Changhai, a member of the Fourth Cooperative of Huzhu Village, Second District, Qinggang County, Heilongjiang, picked up five carts of manure last winter. Because the manure price in the cooperative was low, he planned to use it on his own garden. After being criticized by the cooperative director, Liu Changhai dumped the five carts of manure into the ditch. More importantly, this situation has seriously affected the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers outside the cooperative for accumulating manure. Now the manure piles of farmers outside the cooperative are getting smaller and smaller. Some farmers outside the cooperative reflect: We are about to join the cooperative; accumulating some manure is exhausting enough. If we join the cooperative, the price is not enough to pay for the effort of dumping the manure. Why bother doing that! Obviously, this is harmful to the completion of the entire agricultural production plan.

It is also extremely wrong to underestimate farmyard manure. At present, the country's industry cannot supply enough chemical fertilizers. Even in the future, when a lot of chemical fertilizers can be produced, farmyard manure will still be indispensable. From the perspective of reducing production costs, it is even more inappropriate to abandon the many farmyard manure that is not used. Not stipulating a reasonable price for the manure accumulated by the members' families, or even not giving any compensation, and not paying attention to accumulating natural fertilizer, while spending a lot of money to buy fertilizer from outside, is obviously not conducive to increasing the actual income of the members.

    农业合作社应当合理规定粪肥的代价
    仲跻福
    黑龙江省不少农业生产合作社的社员不积极积肥；有些老人在入社以前常年积肥，入社以后闲坐或者闲蹓跶也不积肥；有许多乡村满街粪肥没有人捡。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？主要原因是有些农业合作社规定的粪肥代价偏低，个别社甚至无代价地把粪肥统一归社所有。黑龙江省明水县尖山子村张家岗屯农业合作社规定，一垧地的粪肥的代价只算三个劳动日；拜泉县仲维富领导的农业合作社，今春有一户新社员带了四垧地的粪，只给算了六个劳动日作为这些粪肥的代价。这个县有一百三十五个新社和五个老社把社员家里积的粪肥统一归社了，究竟算多少代价至今还没规定。
    为什么农业合作社粪肥代价偏低甚至不给代价呢？主要原因是有些农村工作人员认为粪肥代价高了就会降低每个劳动日的分红数目，就不能“显示农业合作社的优越性”。他们说：粪价不低点，到秋后分红时，扣出了粪价，一个劳动日还能值多少呢！有的认为：“肉烂在锅里，反正增了产是要分给社员的，作价多少没有多大关系。”有的说：“如果车、马、农具代价不合理，要不调整会影响社员情绪，粪肥这玩艺算不了什么，不调整也影响不了生产。”还有些工作人员和社主任对农家自然肥料的作用还缺乏足够的认识。他们说：过去这玩艺儿作用还大些；现在国家工业发展了，得使化学肥料，既省事又借劲。有些村子粪肥遍地，没人去捡，而农业合作社却用许多钱到外地购买大粪。
    合理确定粪肥代价会减少社员的收入吗？事实证明，只有合理地规定粪肥价格，才能使社员的收入增加。由于粪肥代价确定得不合理，农业合作社施肥面积已有减少的趋势。如黑龙江海伦县十四区群众村第二社，一九五三年施肥面积占耕地面积百分之百，一九五四年占百分之八十，一九五五年减少到了百分之七十。这样，怎能增产呢？不能增产，又从那里使社员增加收入呢？再说，社员的实际收入的增加，是应当把他的一切收入计算在内的。粪价也正是社员的劳动收入的一部分。把粪价订得合理，积肥多的人就会增加收入。粪价低或者不作价，就是让不肯积肥的人侵占积肥多的人的劳动收入。这决不是“没有多大关系”的小事，也决不是不影响社员情绪的。黑龙江青岗县二区互助村第四社社员刘长海去年一冬捡了五车粪，因社内粪肥代价低，准备上自己园田；受到社主任批评以后，刘长海便把五车粪倒到沟里了。更值得注意的是，这种情况也严重地影响了社外广大农民的积肥积极性。现在社外农民的粪堆是越来越小、越来越少了。有些社外农民反映：就要入社了；积点粪累得够呛，入了社作的价还不够倒粪的工夫钱，还做那个干啥！很显然，这对整个农业生产计划的完成都是有害的。
    轻视农家自然肥料也是极其错误的。现在国家工业还不能供应足够的化学肥料。就是到了将来，能生产很多化学肥料的时候，农家自然肥料也是不可缺少的。从降低生产成本观点来看，更不应该放弃许多农家自然肥料不用。不给社员家里积的肥料规定合理的价格，甚至不给代价，不重视积存自然肥料，而化很多钱去外面买肥料，对于增加社员的实际收入显然是不利的。
