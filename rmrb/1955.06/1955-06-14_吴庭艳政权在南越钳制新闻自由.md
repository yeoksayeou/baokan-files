　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 12th: Vietnam News Agency reports that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime is suppressing freedom of speech for newspapers in South Vietnam.

　　In Saigon, an average of one newspaper per month is ordered to cease publication for a short period or permanently. Ngo Dinh Diem's police frequently go to newspaper offices to check whether the layout and content of the news meet the Ngo Dinh Diem government's tastes. As a result, Saigon newspapers often have "blank windows" or even leave entire pages blank.

　　The Ngo Dinh Diem government has also taken other arbitrary measures against newspapers. For example, it forbade the "Telegraph" from being distributed in the early morning so as not to affect the sales of the American-funded "Liberty Newspaper."

　　The Saigon "Echo" was ordered to cease publication for three months. After the expiration of the suspension period, it was ordered to close down again after only a few days of publication. Another newspaper, "Investigation Communications," was also forced to cease publication.

　　The above-mentioned actions of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime have aroused dissatisfaction in Saigon's press circles. Many newspapers have come out to question the banning of "Investigation Communications." Ngo Dinh Diem's elements dare not reveal the truth, but only say that the newspaper was sealed due to "special reasons."

    吴庭艳政权在南越钳制新闻自由
    新华社河内十二日讯　越南通讯社报道，吴庭艳政权在南越对报纸的言论自由实行钳制。
    在西贡，每月平均有一家报纸短期或永久地被勒令停刊。吴庭艳的警察经常跑到报馆的办公室，检查新闻的编排和内容是不是符合吴庭艳政府的胃口。这样，西贡的报纸时常“开天窗”，甚至空着整个版面。
    吴庭艳政府还对报纸采取了其他的专横措施。例如，它禁止“电讯报”在清晨发行，以便不影响美国资助的“自由报”的销路。
    西贡“回声报”曾被勒令停刊三个月。它停刊期满后只出版了几天又被命令关门。另外一家报纸“调查通讯”也被迫停刊。
    吴庭艳政权的上述行为已激起西贡报界的不满。很多报纸已出来责问“调查通讯”被禁的事情。吴庭艳分子不敢透露真相，只是说，这家报纸的被封是由于“特殊原因”。
