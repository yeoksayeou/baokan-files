    Streamline the Upper Levels, Strengthen the Lower Levels
    Chen Ji
    Streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels is an extremely important principle in the current organizational rectification work. At present, the county and district organizations in many places have become weaker than before due to several staff transfers. Taking Hunan Province as an example, most of the current county and district staff are newly promoted. The newly promoted district committee members last year accounted for about 70 percent of the total number of district committee members at the end of last year. The newly promoted county committee members last year also accounted for about 50 percent of the total number of county committee members at the end of last year, with individual regions accounting for nearly 80 percent. The number of county and district staff is also not very large. Some counties have not fully staffed the positions of county party secretaries and deputy secretaries. Some districts also lack sufficient staff. Generally speaking, these newly promoted county and district staff, while enthusiastic about their work, lack experience; although they have the determination to complete tasks, they often cannot come up with good solutions. There is no doubt that such a weak grassroots leadership is not commensurate with the current arduous and complex rural work tasks. However, on the other hand, the organizations above the county level are staffed with too many personnel, and the quality of the staff is relatively high. In Hunan Province, the prefectural-level staff of the first-level organs account for about two-thirds of the total number of staff at the same level in the province, and the county-level staff account for 35.4 percent of the total number of staff at the same level in the province; while the county-level staff of county and district organizations account for only about 33 percent of the total number of staff at the same level in the province. This situation shows that the organizational structure above the county level is bloated and overstaffed, while the grassroots organizations that directly lead agricultural production and other rural work are very weak and lack strength. In this organizational rectification work, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee not only discovered the above situation, but also found that the phenomenon of overstaffing in some organs was very serious. One department in one organ had six staff members, all of whom were section chiefs. Some staff members in some organs sit in the office all day long with nothing to do, or only work three or four hours a day, feeling very distressed. However, in the county and district organizations, many staff members are working day and night to complete tasks, so busy that they can't breathe. This unreasonable phenomenon should not continue under any circumstances.

    Therefore, in this rectification, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to transfer a group of staff from the leading organs to strengthen the lower-level leading organizations. It has now been decided to transfer about 5,000 staff from various organs above the county level to strengthen the leadership of county and district organizations and change this unreasonable phenomenon.

    Transferring staff to the countryside has another significant meaning, which is to prepare a force for establishing agricultural production cooperatives. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires this group of transferred staff, after a short period of training to learn the basic policies and experience of establishing and running cooperatives, to join the struggle to develop the agricultural collectivization movement this winter and next spring. This approach is correct. During the land reform period, we sent a large number of staff to the countryside to lead and help the peasants overthrow the rule of the feudal class; now, to carry out the agricultural collectivization movement to change the rural relations of production, it is of course impossible to do well without a strong team of full-time staff. Recently, in the work of rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province, it was found that an important reason why some agricultural production cooperatives were not doing well was the lack of strong leadership and backbone members. Last winter and this spring, Hunan Province only developed 13,000 cooperatives, and it already felt the shortage of staff; while this winter and next spring, Hunan Province plans to develop 45,000 cooperatives, if it does not prepare a force for establishing cooperatives early, it will be caught in a passive position by then. Therefore, the decision of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to transfer staff to the countryside this time is an important step for better carrying out the agricultural collectivization movement in the future, and it is also a necessary condition for doing a good job in agricultural production cooperatives.

    The phenomenon of bloated organizational structures and overstaffing above the county level, while the grassroots organizations lack leadership, is not unique to Hunan Province; other regions have it as well. Therefore, the approach of the Hunan Provincial Committee is worth learning from in various regions.

    精简上层，充实下层
    陈迹
    精简上层，充实下层，是目前整编工作中一个极为重要的原则。目前，很多地方的县、区组织，因为工作人员经过几次调动，力量已较前薄弱。拿湖南省来说，现有的县、区工作人员，大部分是新提拔起来的。去年新提拔的区委委员，占去年年底区委委员总数的百分之七十左右。去年新提拔的县委委员，也占去年年底县委委员总数的百分之五十左右，个别地区占近百分之八十。县、区工作人员的数量也不很多。有些县没有配齐正副县委书记。有些区的工作人员也不够。一般说，这些新提拔的县、区工作人员，工作虽然热情，但缺少经验；虽然有完成任务的决心，但往往拿不出好的办法来。毫无疑问，这样薄弱的基层领导力量，是同当前繁重、复杂的农村工作任务不相称的。但是，另一方面，县以上组织配备的工作人员却过多，工作人员的质量也比较高。湖南省一级机关的地委级工作人员，约占全省同级工作人员的三分之二，县级工作人员占全省同级工作人员的百分之三十五点四；而县、区组织的县级工作人员却只占全省同级工作人员的百分之三十三左右。这种情况说明了县以上组织机构的臃肿，人员过多；而直接领导农业生产和农村其他工作的基层组织则非常薄弱，力量不足。湖南省委在这次整编机构的工作中，不仅发现了上述情况，而且发现了某些机关人浮于事的现象十分严重。有个机关的一个科有六个工作人员，却都是科长。有的机关的某些工作人员整天坐在办公室内，没有工作可做，或者一天只做三、四个钟头的工作，感到很苦恼。但是在县、区组织中，不少工作人员却夜以继日地突击任务，忙得不可开交，感到透不过气来。这种不合理的现象，无论如何是不应该继续下去了。
    因此，中共湖南省委员会在这次整编中，决定从领导机关中抽调一批工作人员，去充实下层领导机构。现已确定，从县以上各机关抽调五千名左右工作人员去加强县、区组织的领导力量，改变这种不合理的现象。
    抽调工作人员下乡，还有另一个重大的意义，那就是准备一批建立农业生产合作社的力量。中共湖南省委员会要求这批被抽调的工作人员，在经过短期的训练，学会建社、办社的基本政策和经验以后，就投入今冬明春发展农业合作化运动的斗争中去。这种做法是正确的。在土地改革时期，我们曾经派出大批工作人员下乡，领导和帮助农民推翻了封建阶级的统治；现在要开展改变农村生产关系的农业合作化运动，没有一批坚强的专职的工作人员，当然是搞不好的。最近湖南省各地在整顿和巩固农业生产合作社的工作中，发现有些农业生产合作社所以搞不好，一个重要的原因就是缺少坚强的领导力量和骨干分子。去冬今春湖南省才发展到一万三千个社，就已感到工作人员力量的不足；而今冬明春湖南省准备发展到四万五千个社，如果现在不及早准备一批建社的力量，到时候就会陷于被动。所以，这次中共湖南省委决定抽调工作人员下乡，这是今后更好地开展农业合作化运动的一个重要步骤，也就是搞好农业生产合作社的必要的条件。
    县以上组织机构的臃肿，人员过多，而基层组织领导力量不足的现象，不只是湖南省有，其他地区同样也是有的。因此，湖南省委的这种做法，是值得各地学习的。
