Today, this newspaper publishes the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, further proving that Hu Feng and his gang are a group of counter-revolutionary elements who have close ties with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. This serious incident should arouse the vigilance of the people of the whole country, and lessons should be learned from this incident.

Now, the mask of the Hu Feng group has been completely unmasked. The identities of the Hu Feng elements are now also generally clear. It can be said that imperialist Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and turncoats are the basic backbone of this group.

According to the existing materials, Hu Feng elements have infiltrated some of our government organs, some military organs, some educational organs, some cultural publishing organs and newspapers, and some economic organs. They have also infiltrated the leading organs of some mass organizations such as trade unions and the Communist Youth League.

They have also infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party, and some have even held quite important positions. This group of so-called "Communists" are loyal to Hu Feng, this counter-revolutionary element, but adopt deceptive methods towards the Party.

It must be pointed out that many of our people are not highly vigilant against hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and many have simply lost their vigilance. The fact that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was able to mix in the people's camp for so long before being exposed is proof of our lack of vigilance or loss of vigilance. We must also raise the question: if the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique can mix into our ranks, even into the ranks of the Communist Party, why can't other counter-revolutionary elements use similar double-dealing methods to hide in our organs, troops, schools, factories, mines, people's organizations, and democratic parties? It should be said that they will inevitably mix in, and there is already evidence to prove that they have mixed in in many places.

We must thoroughly smash the Hu Feng clique and eliminate this group of counter-revolutionary elements from the people's ranks. At the same time, we must also resolutely and thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements similar to the Hu Feng clique hidden in our ranks! We cannot sleep with tigers, and we cannot recognize counter-revolutionary elements as good people!

From the counter-revolutionary incident of the Hu Feng clique, we must also deeply realize that as long as the members of our revolutionary ranks are politically negligent and lose their vigilance against counter-revolution, it will provide these counter-revolutionary elements with the conditions to carry out activities. According to the materials that have been exposed, the Hu Feng clique elements listed many problematic people as targets for their deception and exploitation. They sought out and used people with ideological errors, people who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party, people with historical problems, and people who had lost their vigilance, and won them over, causing these people to fall into their trap. The Hu Feng clique tried to develop organizations within our Party, state organs, people's organizations, and cultural and educational organs, and started with these unsound elements. Therefore, every unit and every individual in our revolutionary ranks must raise their vigilance, not be fooled by counter-revolutionary elements; and must learn a skill, to be good at identifying counter-revolutionary elements, in order to expose all counter-revolutionary conspiracies.

The vast majority (over ninety percent) of our revolutionary ranks are good people, and only a few are hidden counter-revolutionary elements or bad elements. But we must not underestimate these counter-revolutionary elements or bad elements, and must resolutely eliminate them. Otherwise, they will spread, expand their numbers, damage our bodies, and cause serious losses to our cause.

In the great movement for the country's socialist industrialization and the construction of a socialist society, the class struggle is becoming more acute, and counter-revolutionary elements will inevitably carry out more sabotage activities. But we have the ability to smash all the activities of counter-revolutionary elements, because we have strong revolutionary forces. The foundation of our strength is the political vigilance of the people and their ability to distinguish counter-revolutionary elements. This requires our leading organs at all levels to pay full attention to strengthening their political education and organizational leadership of the masses.

Attention must be paid to thoroughly investigating all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and these investigated elements must be resolutely and appropriately dealt with in a differentiated manner. This is the task of all members of the entire revolutionary ranks, and this is a major matter that all patriots must pay attention to.

    必须从胡风事件吸取教训
    今天本报发表了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，进一步证明胡风和他的一伙是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的一群反革命分子。这一严重事件，应当引起全国人民的警惕，并从这个事件吸取教训。
    现在，胡风集团的假面已被完全揭穿了。胡风分子到底是一些什么人，现在也大体有了眉目。可以说，帝国主义国民党特务分子，反动军官，托洛茨基分子，革命叛徒，自首变节分子，就是这个集团的基本骨干。
    根据现在已有的材料，胡风分子已经混进我们的某些政府机关、某些军事机关、某些教育机关、某些文化出版机关和报馆以及某些经济机关，他们还混进了某些工会、青年团等群众团体的领导机关。
    他们也混进了中国共产党，有的还担任了相当重要的职务。这批所谓“共产党员”，对胡风这个反革命分子是忠实的，对党则采取欺骗手段。
    必须指出，我们的很多人对于暗藏的反革命分子，警惕性是不高的，许多人简直丧失了警惕性。胡风反革命集团能在人民阵营中混了这样久才被揭露出来，就是我们警惕性不高或者丧失警惕性的证明。我们还要这样提出问题：如果胡风反革命集团能够混到我们的队伍中来，甚至混到共产党的队伍中来，为什么别的反革命分子不能用类似胡风的两面派手法，暗藏在我们的机关、部队、学校、工矿、人民团体和民主党派中呢？应该说，他们必然会混进来，而且已有材料证明在许多地方已经混进来了。
    我们必须彻底粉碎胡风集团，把这批反革命分子从人民队伍中清除出去。同时，我们也要把类似胡风集团的一切暗藏在我们队伍中的反革命分子坚决地彻底地清除出去！我们不能同老虎睡在一起，不能把反革命分子认作好人！
    从胡风集团的反革命事件中，我们还必须深刻认识，只要我们革命队伍的成员在政治上麻痹大意，对反革命丧失警惕，那就会提供这些反革命分子以进行活动的条件。根据已经揭发的材料，胡风集团分子把许多有毛病的人列为他们欺骗利用的对象。他们寻找和利用思想上有错误的人、对共产党不满的人、历史上有问题的人、丧失警惕性的人，加以拉拢，使这些人堕入他们的圈套。胡风集团力图在我们的党内、国家机关内、人民团体内和文化教育机关内发展组织，就是从这些不健全的分子身上下手的。因此，我们革命队伍的每个单位、每一个人都要提高警惕，不要上反革命分子的当；并且都要学到一项本领，要善于辨别反革命分子，以便把一切反革命的阴谋揭露出来。
    我们革命队伍中的绝大多数（百分之九十几）都是好人，只有少数是暗藏的反革命分子或坏分子。但是我们决不可以看轻这些反革命分子或坏分子，必须坚决地把他们清除出去。否则，他们就会蔓延起来，扩大他们的人数，损害我们的肌体，使我们的事业遭到严重的损失。
    在为国家的社会主义工业化和建成社会主义社会的伟大运动中，阶级斗争更加尖锐，反革命分子必然要更加进行破坏活动。但是我们是有能力粉碎一切反革命分子的活动的，因为我们有着强大的革命力量。我们力量的基础是人民群众的政治警惕性和他们对于反革命分子的辨别能力。这就要求我们的各级领导机关充分注意加强自己对群众的政治教育工作和组织领导工作。
    必须注意清查出一切暗藏的反革命分子，必须坚决地有分别地对于清查出来的这些分子给以适当的处理。这是整个革命队伍一切成员的任务，这是一切爱国者必须注意的大事情。
