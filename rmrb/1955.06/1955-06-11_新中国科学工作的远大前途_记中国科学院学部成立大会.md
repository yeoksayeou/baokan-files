    Our Correspondents Bai Sheng, Jin Feng

    I. The Great Unity of Scientists

    In the hall of the inaugural meeting of the Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, hundreds of scientists gathered from all over the country, from various scientific research institutions, industrial sectors, factories, and schools. There were physicists Qian Sanqiang and Zhao Zhongyao from the Institute of Physics, veteran botanist Qian Chongshu from the Institute of Botany, metallurgist Zhou Ren from the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics, antibiotic research expert Wang You from the Institute of Organic Chemistry, mathematicians Chen Jiangong and Su Buqing from university platforms, Zhao Hongzhang, the breeder of the excellent wheat variety Bima No. 1, from the fertile Guanzhong Plain, obstetrics and gynecology expert Lin Qiaozhi and surgeon Huang Jiasi from hospitals, engineer Shao Xianghua from Anshan, the largest steel base in New China, historian and linguist Burhan came from Xinjiang, and mechanician Zhou Peiyuan had just returned from Moscow after attending the bicentennial celebration of Moscow University. Historians Chen Boda and Fan Wenlan, philosophers Yang Xianzhen and Hu Sheng, and writers Mao Dun and Zhou Yang also came to the meeting... Outstanding scientists gathered from all directions, which was unprecedented in the Chinese scientific community.

    Among the older generation of scientists, there were also young scientific workers. They were invited to attend the meeting. Zhang Cunhao, twenty-seven years old, started working at the Institute of Petroleum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1950. Over the past few years, under the guidance and help of the older generation of scientists, he has been able to independently engage in the research of a scientific problem. Many of the academic papers read at this conference were the results of collaborative research between older and younger scientists. On the arduous road of climbing the peak of science, older and younger scientists are supporting each other forward.

    This national-scale unity and cooperation in the scientific community was unimaginable before liberation. Elder historian Chen Yuan, with his long beard, said with emotion at the meeting:

      "I am a person who studies history, and I am over seventy years old this year. The long years of the past seventy years were all in the old society, and the research work I did was under difficult and arduous conditions.

      "At that time, reading and research lacked correct leadership and a clear direction, and only relied on one's own interests to conduct in-depth research. Before liberation, most scientific research workers were 'individual households,' each doing their own thing, and there was no collective to speak of. There was little contact with each other, let alone cooperation. As a result, it was often 'what is learned is not what is used,' 'what is used is not what is learned,' 'science for the sake of science,' and 'separation from reality.' It was impossible to make much contribution to the country and the people. Moreover, the reactionary rulers did not value science at all. Even if we had some creations and inventions, they could not be applied and promoted.

      "Decades have passed like this!" Elder Chen Yuan sighed.

    "China has undergone earth-shaking changes," his voice rose, "We have our own government, and we can engage in scientific research work in accordance with the urgent needs of the people and the current tasks of the country. Our scientists are receiving meticulous care and concern from the Party and the government, and from Chairman Mao. We have a political status, our academic research work is guaranteed, and we have the full support and attention of the people."

    Yes, the people of New China know how to fully cherish every scientific achievement, and also know how to cherish the great unity of scientists today. Vice Premier Chen Yi requested the scientific community to organize and work in a more planned manner at the opening of the conference. He believed that this was of great significance for the development of our national economic construction. This represents the common requirements and evaluation of our people for scientists. Scientists can draw strength from the people endlessly and obtain support from all aspects.

    Support also came from distant Moscow and Warsaw. Academician Bardin, head of the Soviet Academy of Sciences delegation and vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, who recently visited China, said to Chinese scientists at the meeting:

      "Please, Chinese scientists—our friends, believe that Soviet scientists are always ready to contribute their experience to Chinese scientists. We are willing to always share the fruits of scientific work with Chinese scientists."

    Vice President Wierzbicki of the Polish Academy of Sciences, who visited China, warmly congratulated the achievements of the conference. He said: "We are united by a common ideal—the ideal of creating a better future for the people and building socialism."

    Yes, on the vast land of 900 million people, scientists have broken national boundaries and closely united to realize the common great ideal—building socialism and communism.

      II. A Major Event in the Scientific Community

    When Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, solemnly announced the official establishment of the Departments of Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry, the Department of Biology and Earth Sciences, the Department of Technological Sciences, and the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, warm applause rang out throughout the hall. The establishment of the four academic divisions is a concrete measure for the Chinese Academy of Sciences to strengthen academic leadership and a major event in the development of our country's scientific undertakings. It marks the beginning of a new stage in the development of our country's scientific undertakings, and at the same time provides better conditions for the Chinese Academy of Sciences to further establish an academician system.

    For many years, China's scientific research work has not been developed due to the suppression and destruction of feudal forces and imperialism. However, since the founding of New China, the Party and the government have given great care and support to scientific undertakings. Many new scientific research institutions have been established, and some old scientific research institutions left over from the old era have been enriched and adjusted. In 1950, the Chinese Academy of Sciences had only seventeen research institutions, but now it has increased to forty-one. The research units under the various departments of the government have also numbered more than sixty. These research units have also made considerable gains in the research work carried out in the years after liberation. There are more than 38,000 full-time teachers in colleges and universities across the country, and they are also a large army of scientific research work.

    Now, "233 academic division members, outstanding Chinese scientists, will participate in the leadership of Chinese scientific undertakings in a more organized manner." Guo Moruo said excitedly at the inaugural meeting of the academic divisions.

    These outstanding scientists of New China have made considerable contributions in academic research or scientific organization work. Some of them are leaders of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other important scientific research institutions and senior researchers with special achievements, some are well-known professors in universities, and some are major engineers and senior technical cadres in production departments. Today, they are all united in the various academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    This meeting focused on discussing the work outline of the Chinese Academy of Sciences during our country's first five-year plan and the issue of improving the work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to promote the national scientific undertaking. The meeting believed that, generally speaking, the Chinese Academy of Sciences should mainly study basic scientific theories and solve key scientific problems of great significance to the national economy; the scientific research institutions of production departments should mainly solve practical technical problems in production; and the research departments of universities can study basic scientific theories or scientific problems in actual production according to specific conditions. Based on national construction and scientific research strength, the following research projects are planned as the key tasks of the Academy of Sciences during the first five-year plan: research on the peaceful utilization of atomic energy; research in cooperation with the construction of new steel bases; research on petroleum; research on earthquakes; investigation and research in cooperation with river basin planning and development; investigation and research on tropical plant resources in South China; research on China's natural zoning and economic zoning; research on antibiotics; research on various basic theoretical issues in our country's transitional national construction; and research on our country's modern and contemporary history and modern and contemporary intellectual history. Most of these key tasks are already underway.

    Scientists also studied and discussed issues such as cultivating new forces, establishing a degree system, an academician system, and an academic award system, as well as strengthening international scientific cooperation, carrying out discussions and critiques of academic research work, and put forward many valuable opinions.

    At the meeting, scientists read 39 scientific research papers. From these papers, one can see the efforts and contributions made by scientists in various scientific fields in recent years. Scientists conducted free discussions on these academic papers, which further established a new atmosphere of academic research.

    The academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have been established. From now on, more than 230 outstanding Chinese scientists with rich expertise will stand on the position of leading the scientific undertakings of China. This makes it possible for the Chinese Academy of Sciences to strengthen academic leadership in a more organized and planned manner for national scientific work. As Premier Zhou Enlai kindly instructed the 233 academic division members at the conference, they will be connected with thousands of scientific workers in research institutes, factories, schools, and rural areas to promote the entire scientific research work. They will answer the expectations of 600 million people with their wisdom and labor in the great cause of building a new China and building socialism.

    新中国科学工作的远大前途
    ——记中国科学院学部成立大会
    本报记者　柏生　金凤
    一、科学家的大团结
    在中国科学院学部成立大会的大厅中，聚集着几百位来自全国各地、各科学研究机关、各产业部门、各工厂、各学校的科学家。这里有来自物理研究所的物理学家钱三强、赵忠尧，来自植物研究所的老植物学家钱崇澍，来自冶金陶瓷研究所的冶金学家周仁，来自有机化学研究所的抗生素研究专家汪猷，数学家陈建功和苏步青来自大学的讲坛，优良的小麦品种碧蚂一号的培育者赵洪璋来自肥美的关中平原，妇产科专家林巧稚和外科专家黄家驷来自医院，工程师邵象华来自新中国最大的钢铁基地鞍山，历史、语言学家鲍尔汉是从新疆来的，力学家周培源刚从莫斯科参加了莫斯科大学二百周年校庆纪念会赶回来。历史学家陈伯达、范文澜，哲学家杨献珍、胡绳，文学家茅盾和周扬也来到会场。……优秀的科学家从四面八方聚集拢来，这在中国的科学界是空前的。
    在老一辈的科学家之间，也坐着年轻一代的科学工作者。他们是被邀请列席这个会议的。二十七岁的张存浩是一九五○年到中国科学院石油研究所工作的。几年来，在老一代的科学家的指导和帮助之下，他已经能够独立从事一个科学问题的研究。在这次大会上宣读的许多篇学术论文，都是老一辈的科学家和年轻的科学工作者合作研究的成果。在攀登科学高峰的艰辛的道路上，年老的同年轻的科学家们在互相扶持着前进。
    科学界的这种全国规模的团结和合作，在解放以前是不能设想的。长须飘拂的历史学家陈垣老先生在大会上充满感慨地叙述：
      “我是一个研究历史的人，今年七十多岁了。以往七十年的漫长岁月都是在旧社会，所作的研究工作都是在困苦艰难的情况下过来的。
      “那时候，读书研究，没有正确的领导，没有明确的方向，只凭自己的兴趣，作埋头的钻研。解放前大多数科学研究工作者都是‘单干户’，各人搞各人的，谈不到什么集体。彼此之间很少有联系，更难得有合作。结果常常是‘所学非所用’，‘所用非所学’，‘为学术而学术’，‘脱离实际’。对国家和人民不可能有多少贡献。而且反动统治者根本不重视科学。就是我们有一些创造和发明，也得不到应用和推广。
      “几十年就这样过去了”！陈垣老先生慨叹着。
    “中国起了翻天覆地的变化，”他的声音提高起来，“我们有了自己的政府，我们可以按照人民的迫切需要、国家当前的任务来从事科学研究工作了。我们科学家受到党和政府、受到毛主席的无微不至的照顾和关怀。我们在政治上有了地位，我们的学术研究工作有了保障，得到人民充分的支持和重视。”
    是的，新中国的人民懂得充分珍视每一种科学成果，也懂得珍视科学家们今天的大团结。陈毅副总理在大会开幕时要求科学界组织起来，更有计划地进行工作，他认为这对发展我国国民经济建设有重大意义。这代表了我国人民对科学家的共同要求和估价。科学家们可以源源不绝地从人民那儿汲取力量，并且取得各方面的支援。
    支援的手还来自辽远的莫斯科和华沙。最近来中国访问的苏联科学院代表团团长、苏联科学院副院长巴尔金院士在大会上向中国科学家们说：
      “请中国科学家们——我们的朋友相信，苏联科学家随时准备向中国科学家们贡献出自己的经验。我们愿意永远和中国科学家们共同享受科学工作的成果。”
    访问中国的波兰科学院副院长维日比茨基院士热情地祝贺大会的成就。他说：“我们是由共同的理想——为人民创造美好的未来、建设社会主义事业的理想团结在一起的”。
    是的，在九万万人口的辽阔的土地上，科学家们打破了国家的界限，为实现共同的伟大理想——建设社会主义和共产主义而亲密地结成一体。
      二、科学界的一件大事
    当中国科学院郭沫若院长隆重地宣布了中国科学院的物理学数学化学部、生物学地学部、技术科学部和哲学社会科学部正式成立的时候，整个会场上响起了热烈的掌声。四个学部的成立，是中国科学院加强学术领导的一项具体措施，是我国科学事业发展中的一件大事。它标志着我国科学事业发展中的一个新阶段的开始，同时也为中国科学院进一步建立院士制度更好地准备了条件。
    多少年来，中国的科学研究工作，由于封建势力和帝国主义的压制和摧残，没有得到发展。但从新中国成立以来，党和政府就对科学事业给予极大的关怀和支持。许多新的科学研究机构建立起来了，旧时代遗留下来的一些旧的科学研究机构获得了充实和调整。一九五○年中国科学院研究机构还只有十七个，现在增加到四十一个了。政府各部门所属的研究单位，也已经有了约六十多个。这些研究单位在解放后几年中所进行的研究工作也有了不少的收获。全国高等学校专任教师三万八千多人，他们也是科学研究工作的一支大军。
    现在，“二百三十三位学部委员，中国优秀的科学家，要更有组织地参加中国科学事业的领导工作了。”郭沫若兴奋地在学部成立大会上这样说。
    这些新中国优秀的科学家，他们在学术研究上或科学组织工作上都曾作出不少的贡献，他们有的是中国科学院和其他重要科学研究机构的领导人员和有特殊成就的高级研究人员，有的是高等学校的著名教授，有的是生产部门的主要工程师和高级技术干部。今天他们都团结在中国科学院各学部里来了。
    这次会议着重讨论了我国第一个五年计划期间中国科学院的工作纲要和改进中国科学院工作以推动全国科学事业的问题。会议认为大体说来，今后中国科学院主要的应该是研究基本的科学理论和解决对于国民经济具有重要意义的关键性的科学问题，生产部门的科学研究机构主要的应当解决生产中的实际技术问题，高等学校的研究部门可根据具体条件研究基础的科学理论或实际生产中的科学问题。根据国家建设和科学研究的力量，在第一个五年计划期间，准备以下列研究项目作为科学院的重点工作：原子能和平利用的研究；配合新钢铁基地的建设的研究；石油的研究；地震的研究；配合流域规划和开发的调查研究；华南热带植物资源的调查研究；中国自然区划和经济区划的研究；抗生素的研究；我国过渡时期国家建设中的各种基本理论问题的研究；我国近代、现代史和近代、现代思想史的研究。这些重点工作大部分已经在进行当中。
    科学家们对培养新生力量、建立学位制度、院士制度和学术奖励制度，以及加强国际间的科学合作，开展学术研究工作的讨论和批判等问题，都进行了研究和讨论，并且提出不少珍贵的意见。
    会议上，科学家们宣读了三十九篇科学研究论文。从这些论文中可以看到几年来科学家们在各门科学领域中所作的努力和贡献。科学家们对于这些学术论文，进行了自由讨论，这进一步树立了学术研究的新风气。
    中国科学院的学部成立了。从此，二百三十多位具有丰富的专门知识的中国优秀的科学家，站到中国科学事业领导工作的岗位上来了。这就使得中国科学院有可能对全国科学工作更有组织、更有计划地加强学术领导。正如周恩来总理在大会上亲切地向着二百三十三位学部委员指示的，他们将联系着成千上万的研究室、工厂、学校、农村中的科学工作者，推动整个的科学研究工作。他们将在建设新中国、建设社会主义的伟大事业中，以自己的智慧和劳动来回答六万万人民的期望。
