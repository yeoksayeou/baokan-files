    Liberate Useful Materials from Warehouses
    Wang Pu
    At present, the value of materials stockpiled in various economic sectors across the country amounts to tens of billions of yuan. How to fully utilize these materials and put them into production and construction is a very important issue in comprehensive conservation.

    Recently, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant actively contacted other construction units and sold 3 million yuan worth of stockpiled materials; they compared inventory material lists and reviewed the material usage plans for the second half of the year submitted by each work area. They did not purchase materials that were already in stock, saving nearly 600 tons of steel. The Third Engineering Company of Shenyang held an exhibition of stockpiled materials, criticizing erroneous ideas such as "only care about supply, not about stockpiling" and "only care about progress, not about waste," which educated the construction management personnel of each work site. More than 100 types of electrical materials and 800 cubic meters of wood, which were previously considered unusable, will now mostly be used in this year's projects under the condition that the quality of the project is not affected. Scrap steel wires and rebar ends are processed into electric wires, iron nails, and round steel, turning them into useful things again. The Engineering Company directly under the General Logistics Department in Beijing proactively provided the specifications and quantities of its inventory materials to the design departments, so that equipment that had been stockpiled for many years was used in this year's projects. The Changchun Municipal People's Committee established a special organization to centrally regulate the stockpiled materials in the city, and in just over a month, materials worth more than 700,000 yuan were utilized. The Shenyang Municipal Materials Bureau and other relevant units organized a latent construction material adjustment meeting, where over three days, more than 800 tons of various steel materials, 120,000 red bricks, and more than 500 tons of cement, worth 550,000 yuan, were adjusted, providing urgently needed materials for many key projects. These are all effective methods for utilizing stockpiled materials.

    The achievements of these units show that actively dealing with stockpiled materials can quickly achieve significant economic results: national investment can be reduced, the speed of capital turnover can be accelerated, materials urgently needed by many units can be supplied, and storage costs can be saved. This can free up a lot of funds and useful materials to be invested in new construction. Taking this measure does not require capital investment or overcoming any technical difficulties, only necessary cleanup and organizational work.

    However, some leading organs are afraid of trouble and do not actively do organizational work. Some units with stockpiled materials hold the idea of "being prepared for a rainy day" and "long-term planning," and are reluctant to give things they do not need to others; or they do not pay attention to this work, and no one is responsible for cleaning up and handling stockpiled materials. Some units that need materials like the new and dislike the old, and are unwilling to use stockpiled materials; even after the Party Central Committee proposed comprehensive conservation, some units have not changed their view of "generous planning, tight use," and continue to blindly apply to higher authorities for allocation and purchase everywhere, creating new stockpiles. For those who have these erroneous thoughts and behaviors, leading workers at all levels should educate them and carry out necessary struggles to strive to turn more stagnant materials into living assets and into a huge material force for completing this year's production and capital construction plans.

### 把有用的物资从仓库里解放出来

    把有用的物资从仓库里解放出来
    王朴
    目前在全国各个经济部门中积压着的物资，价值有几万万元。如何充分利用这些物资，使之投到生产建设中去，这是全面节约中的一个很重要的问题。
    最近，第一汽车制造厂积极地同其他建设单位联系，推销了价值三百万元的积压物资；他们对照库存材料单，审查各工区提出的下半年用料计划，凡库存单上有的就不用购置，节约了近六百吨钢材。沈阳市第三工程公司举办积压材料展览会，批判了“只管供应，不顾积压”、“只顾进度、不问浪费”等错误思想，使各工地的施工管理人员受到了教育，过去认为不能用的一百多种电气材料和八百立方公尺的木材，现在决定大部分要在不影响工程质量的条件下用到今年的工程中去。对废钢线和钢筋头等残料，他们加工成电线、铁钉、圆钢，又变成了有用的东西。在北京的总后勤部直属工程公司，主动地把库存物资的规格数量提供给设计部门，使积压多年的设备在今年的工程中被采用了。长春市人民委员会成立了专门的机构，统一调剂全市的积压物资，一个多月中使价值七十多万元的物资得到了利用。沈阳市的物资局等有关单位组织了基本建设潜在物资调剂会议，三天中调剂了各种钢材八百多吨，红砖十二万块、水泥五百多吨，价值五十五万元，使许多重点工程得到了急需的材料。这些，都是利用积压材料的有效办法。
    这些单位的成绩表明，积极地处理积压物资，可以迅速地取得重大的经济效果：国家的投资可以减少，资金周转速度可以加快，许多单位急需的物资可以得到供应，保管费用可以节省；从而可以腾出很多的资金和有用的物资投到新的建设中去。而采取这个措施，既不要花本钱，又不要克服什么技术上的困难，只要进行必要的清理工作和组织工作。
    可是，也有一些领导机关，怕麻烦，不积极地去做组织工作。有些积压物资的单位抱着“有备无患”、“长期打算”的思想，舍不得把自己用不着的东西让给别人；或者不重视这件工作，清理和处理积压物资的工作无人负责。有些需要材料的单位喜新厌旧，不愿意使用积压物资；甚至在党中央提出全面节约以后，有些单位还不改变“宽打窄用”的观点，继续盲目地向上级申请调拨和四出购买，制造着新的积压。对于有这些错误思想和行为的人，各级领导工作人员应该向他们进行教育和作必要的斗争，以争取把更多的呆滞物资变成活的财产，变成完成今年的生产和基本建设计划的一支巨大的物质力量。
