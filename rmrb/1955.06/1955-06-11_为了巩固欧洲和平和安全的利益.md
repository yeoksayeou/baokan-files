    The Soviet government, in its June 7th note to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, proposed the establishment of direct diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between the two countries, and welcomed Adenauer and the West German government to send representatives to Moscow to jointly consider the issue of establishing diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries. This Soviet note brings wonderful hope to the German people and points out prospects for consolidating peace and security in Europe and the world, which is conducive to easing international tensions. All those who cherish peace cannot but express warm welcome and support for the Soviet statement.
    The Soviet note starts from the premise that the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany not only fully conforms to the national interests of the German and Soviet peoples, but also conforms to the interests of consolidating peace and the security of European countries. Historical experience has proven more than once that maintaining normal and good relations between the Soviet Union and the German people is the key to European peace and security. The disruption of such relations between the two countries can only become a factor of European unrest, and even lead to European wars, with the Soviet and German people being the first to suffer. No one will forget that in the Second World War, the Soviet Union and Germany suffered more severe destruction and sacrifices than any other country. Almost eight million Germans paid with their lives in the war, and seven million Soviet people died. The loss of wealth was enormous. Obviously, the Soviet and German peoples do not want such a historical tragedy to be repeated, and they both hope that the people of the two countries can maintain and strengthen their friendly relations.
    The normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany is of particular significance to the current international situation. After the end of the Second World War, the people of European countries sincerely hoped that they could live a stable life in a peaceful environment from then on, and develop friendly relations with the people of other countries in the world. For ten years, the Soviet Union has made many efforts in this regard, and the people of European countries have also carried out unremitting struggles for this purpose. However, the international aggressive forces completely ignore the legitimate aspirations of the European people, and try their best to oppose and reject the various initiatives of the Soviet Union to strengthen European peace and security, pursuing a policy of creating division and confrontation, and intensifying international tensions, and are bent on turning Germany into a new battlefield in Europe, turning the German people into cannon fodder again. Therefore, Europe is increasingly shrouded in a deepening threat of a new war. The European people cannot obtain a stable life, and world peace cannot be guaranteed. For the sake of peace, the Soviet Union now takes the initiative to propose direct consultations with West Germany to seek to improve relations between the two countries. This opens up another way to defend European and world peace and ease international tensions. If this proposal can break through the obstruction of international war forces and be realized, it may have a major impact on the current situation.
    Since the post-war period, the Soviet Union has consistently worked to improve relations between the Soviet and German peoples and to establish a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany. The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have already established friendly relations on the principles of mutual respect and mutual trust, and mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries in economic, cultural and other fields have continued to develop. Judging from trade alone, the German Democratic Republic's trade with the Soviet Union in 1954 increased nearly two and a half times compared with 1950. The consolidation of friendly relations with the Soviet Union has greatly helped the peaceful development of the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, the Soviet Union has also continuously sought to improve its relations with West Germany. When the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Malenkov, received the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, on June 11, 1954, he expressed that the Soviet Union was willing to consider the demands that West German people might raise regarding the establishment of economic and cultural relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union. The Soviet government's statement on the German issue on January 15 this year also clearly announced that the Soviet government is willing to normalize relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany. Now, the Soviet Union has further invited the West German government to send representatives to Moscow for talks. There is no doubt that all of this is conducive to resolving the issue of German unification, which the German people have long hoped for.
    The normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will be conducive to the restoration of normal trade relations between the two countries. In recent years, West Germany's industry and economy have recovered. However, if it were not forced to restrict its trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, it would undoubtedly have achieved greater development in the economic field. West Germany's current trade relations with the Soviet Union and other People's Democracies are unsatisfactory. Before the war, Germany had extensive trade with the Soviet Union, and the trade volume between the two countries once reached 20% of the total foreign trade of both sides. However, due to being constrained by so-called quota systems and licenses, West Germany's trade with the Soviet Union has been minimal in recent years. In 1954, West Germany's trade volume with the Soviet Union was less than 0.4% of its total trade volume. West Germany's trade volume with the entire peace and democracy camp also accounts for less than 3% of its total trade volume. This situation is obviously not in line with the hopes of the West German people. West German Deputy Chancellor Blücher also stated: Expanding West Germany's trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Democracies, and China will make it "easier to solve several economic and trade policy issues that West Germany is worried about." Especially in the context of the increasing instability of the economies of some Western countries, expanding trade between West Germany and the Soviet Union is clearly of great significance to West Germany's economy.
    At the same time, the role of cultural exchange in strengthening friendship between the people of the two countries cannot be underestimated. The Soviet Union and Germany both have brilliant and long-standing cultural traditions, and maintaining and strengthening cultural ties between the two countries will not only help promote mutual understanding and cultural progress between the two sides, but also make great contributions to the culture of Europe and the world.
    Therefore, the Soviet note was immediately warmly welcomed by the West German people. Various political parties attached great importance to the Soviet proposal, considering it "part of the Soviet Union's recent actions aimed at promoting negotiations on current European issues" and "a matter of great political importance." The West German government has issued a formal statement welcoming the Soviet invitation and stating that it is appropriate for the Federal Chancellor to hold consultations with Soviet government officials. People expect the West German government to take a positive attitude and swift action towards the Soviet proposal.
    Those who are unwilling to ease international tensions cannot hide the unease in their hearts about the Soviet proposal. Washington officials insisted that even if the talks between the Soviet Union and West Germany were held, they would not achieve positive results. Some people are plotting to obstruct the establishment of normal relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany. But as long as the West German government, like the Soviet Union, holds the desire to establish normal relations based on the principles of mutual trust and peaceful cooperation, then people have reason to expect the realization of the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany, which will be a major contribution to the cause of peace.

### 为了巩固欧洲和平和安全的利益

    为了巩固欧洲和平和安全的利益
    苏联政府六月七日照会德意志联邦共和国政府，建议建立两国间直接的外交、贸易和文化关系，并欢迎阿登纳和西德政府派遣代表前往莫斯科共同考虑关于两国之间建立外交和贸易关系的问题。苏联这个照会给德意志人民带来了美好的希望，给欧洲和全世界指出了巩固和平和安全的前景，有利于缓和国际紧张局势。凡是珍视和平的人，都不能不对苏联的声明表示热烈欢迎和支持。
    苏联的照会是从这样的前提出发的：苏联和西德之间关系的正常化不仅完全符合德国和苏联人民的民族利益，而且符合巩固和平和欧洲各国安全的利益。历史经验不止一次地证明，苏联和德国两国人民之间维持正常和良好的关系是欧洲和平和安全的关键。两国间的这种关系遭到破坏，只能成为欧洲不安的因素，甚至导致欧洲的战争，而深受其害的首先是苏联和德国的人民。谁都不会忘记在第二次大战中，苏联和德国曾遭受比任何一国都严重的破坏和牺牲。几乎有八百万德国人在战争中付出了他们的生命，苏联人民死亡也达七百万人。财富的损失是非常巨大的。很显然，苏联和德国人民都不希望这样的历史惨剧重演，他们都希望两国人民能够保持和加强彼此的友好关系。
    苏联同西德关系的正常化，对于目前的国际局势有着特别重大的意义。第二次世界大战结束以后，欧洲各国人民都衷心希望从此能够在一个和平的环境中过安定的生活，并同世界其他各国人民发展友好的关系。十年来苏联在这方面作了许多的努力，欧洲各国人民也为此进行了不懈的斗争。但是国际侵略势力完全无视欧洲人民的这种正当愿望，竭力反对和拒绝苏联为加强欧洲和平和安全的各种倡议，推行制造分裂和对立、加剧国际紧张局势的政策，一心要把德国变成为欧洲的新战场。把德国人民再度变成炮灰。因此欧洲越来越笼罩在日益加深的新战争威胁之下。欧洲人民得不到安定的生活，世界和平得不到保障。苏联为了和平的利益，现在主动提出建议，同西德进行直接商谈，以谋求改善两国间的关系。这就开辟了保卫欧洲和世界和平、缓和国际紧张局势的又一途径。如果这个建议能够冲破国际战争势力的阻挠得到实现，它将有可能对目前局势发生重大影响。
    战后以来苏联一贯地为改善苏联和德国人民之间的关系，为建立一个统一、民主、和平的德国而努力。苏联和德意志民主共和国已经在互相尊重和互相信任的原则上建立了友好的关系，而且两国间在经济、文化各方面的互助合作不断获得发展。就从贸易方面来看，德意志民主共和国一九五四年同苏联的贸易比一九五○年增加了近两倍半。同苏联的友好关系的巩固，大大帮助了德意志民主共和国的和平发展。同时苏联也不断谋求改善它和西德的关系。前苏联部长会议主席马林科夫在一九五四年六月十一日接见德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥时，就曾表示苏联愿意考虑西德人士可能提出的关于西德和苏联建立经济和文化关系的要求。苏联政府今年一月十五日就德国问题发表的声明，又明白宣布苏联政府愿意使苏联和西德之间的关系正常化。现在，苏联进一步邀请西德政府派遣代表到莫斯科去会谈。毫无疑问，这都是有助于解决德国人民长期盼望的德国统一的问题的。
    实现苏联和德意志联邦共和国关系正常化，将有利于恢复两国间的正常贸易关系。近年来西德的工业和经济已经恢复了。但是，如果它不是因为被迫限制了它对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易，那末，它在经济方面无疑会获得更大的发展。西德目前同苏联以及其他人民民主国家的贸易关系，是不能令人满意的。战前德国同苏联曾经进行过广泛的贸易，两国贸易额曾经达到双方对外贸易总额的百分之二十。但是西德因为受到所谓定额制度和许可证等束缚，近年来同苏联的贸易来往微乎其微。一九五四年西德同苏联的贸易额还不到它全部贸易总额的百分之零点四。西德同整个和平民主阵营的贸易量也占不到它的贸易总额百分之三。这种状况显然是不符合西德人民的希望的。西德副总理布吕希也曾表示：扩大西德同苏联、人民民主国家和中国的贸易，将使西德“担心的几个有关经济和贸易政策的问题可以比较容易地得到解决”。特别是在西方一些国家的经济愈来愈不稳定的情况下，扩大西德和苏联之间的贸易，对于西德的经济显然具有重要的意义。
    同时，不能低估文化交流对于加强两国人民友好的作用。苏联和德国都有光辉悠久的文化传统，保持和加强两国间的文化联系不仅有助于促进双方的彼此了解和文化的进步，而且对于欧洲和世界的文化都能有很大的贡献。
    因此，苏联的照会立刻受到了西德人民热烈的欢迎。各个不同政党都极其重视苏联的建议，认为是“苏联最近采取的目的在于促成讨论目前欧洲的问题的谈判的行动的一部分”，是“具有极大的政治重要性的一件事”。西德政府已发表正式声明表示欢迎苏联的邀请，并且表示联邦总理同苏联的政府人士举行商谈是适宜的。人们期待西德政府对苏联的建议采取积极态度和迅速的行动。
    不愿意缓和国际紧张局势的人对苏联的建议掩不住他们心中的不安。华盛顿的官员硬说苏联同西德的会谈即使举行也不会取得积极的结果。有些人正图谋阻挠苏联同西德的正常关系的建立。但是只要西德政府能和苏联一样，抱着根据相互信任和和平合作的原则建立正常关系的愿望，那末人们就有理由期待苏联同西德关系正常化的实现，这将是对和平事业的一个重大贡献。
