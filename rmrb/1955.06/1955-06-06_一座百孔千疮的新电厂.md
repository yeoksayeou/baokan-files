    A New Power Plant Riddled with a Hundred Holes and a Thousand Flaws
    Jiang Xiguang

    The Xuan Gang Coal Mine Preparation Office in Shanxi Province built a new power plant last year. Its task is to supply power for the coal mine's basic construction. However, due to the poor quality of the design and construction, this power plant is far from being able to shoulder the important tasks it should.

    As of February 3rd this year, the power plant had already experienced seventy-eight wall cracks. The most serious was in the boiler room, with thirty-five cracks totaling 23.8 meters in length. The widest cracks were four millimeters wide. Of the thirteen pillars inspected, twelve had varying degrees of subsidence. The most serious, pillar number ten, had sunk thirty millimeters. The sewage well was built 3.5 meters away from the plant building. Due to design errors, the sewage could not flow out and instead flowed back into the plant building, eroding the foundation. In the area between the sewage well and the plant building, the soil above ninety centimeters from the ground could be kneaded into mud, and the soil below ninety centimeters had become slurry. Due to these reasons, the ground in the pump room near the boiler has largely subsided.

    The quality of machine installation is also very poor. Now, only two machines can be operated alternately, and the one in operation can only use one-sixth of its load. The elevation of the machine before and after, according to the design requirements, should have an inclination of one in ten thousand, but is now one in one hundred and sixty. The entire machine is operating askew. The pipeline installation is poor. People call it "three leaks": steam pipes leak steam, water pipes leak water, and oil pipes leak oil.

    Currently, the power plant is taking emergency measures to reinforce the wall foundation by driving small wooden piles on both sides of the wall foundation and taking waterproofing measures to try to prevent the wall cracks from continuing to expand. The machines have also been dismantled and re-installed, expanding the base support area, with wooden piles being driven underneath. As a result, a large amount of capital has been wasted, and the progress of other projects has been seriously affected. For example, the coal mine's drilling unit originally planned to complete the drilling task by the end of March, but had to stop work due to insufficient power supply.

    The main reason for the poor quality of the power plant project is that the designers did not fully understand the complexity of the project and had a blindly optimistic attitude. At the beginning of the design, there was only an incomplete drawing. The designers believed that only minor modifications were needed, and that the entire design could be submitted in twenty days. Therefore, the construction unit prepared to start work twenty days later. In fact, when the construction unit went to retrieve the drawings at the agreed-upon time, the design unit was only able to provide a few simple plan, elevation, and section drawings of the plant building, which were of course impossible to construct from. The designer did not design the machine base and boiler foundation, but simply wrote down the numbers on a note and sent it for construction first, with detailed dimensions to be provided later. Thus, design and construction proceeded simultaneously, and the design drawings were not fully submitted even after completion. According to preliminary statistics, formal drawings were fewer than revised drawings, revised drawings were fewer than original sketches, original sketches were fewer than hand-drawn drawings without a scale, and hand-drawn drawings were fewer than oral instructions or messages. In short, there were no changes without drawings, and no repairs without drawings. Some were revised and repaired again and again. If you were to ask how many design drawings were actually used for this project, it is still a mystery. This erroneous approach, of course, cannot guarantee the quality of the project.

    Another reason for the poor quality of the power plant project is that the construction unit's technical supervision was not strict, and construction was not carried out according to design requirements and construction operating procedures. At the same time, there was also a purely task-oriented view, believing that as long as the design unit put forward construction items, whether it was a drawing, a note, or a message, construction could be carried out. Anyway, if an accident occurred, it was the design unit's business, and it had nothing to do with them.

    In the construction process, the design personnel's lack of attention to the opinions of the workers also caused great waste. For example, the original design of the machine base had a small area and poor foundation. The experienced workers suggested driving wooden piles, but the designers not only did not consider this opinion, but also proudly said: "This design has been scientifically calculated. It is economical and reasonable. You can rest assured to carry out the construction!" But when problems arose and repairs became necessary, the designers went to the site for a tour and said: "This problem is very complicated and difficult to solve. We will go back and consult before replying." And then they just left. Later, after the construction unit collected the opinions of the masses and drafted a drawing and written explanation of "driving wooden piles to expand the machine base," the designers agreed to this opinion and suggested that the weight of the machine base should be increased four times. There were also the chimneys used in the power plant. The original machine accessories were four iron chimneys designed, each more than nine meters long, but later the designers asked to reduce one section. This section is still lying in the field. If this was the case, why didn't they propose to buy one less section when ordering? Preliminary estimates suggest that there are more than 160 similar issues.

    In our country's economic construction, we should complete more tasks with the least amount of money, so that all construction projects meet the requirements of "good, fast, economical, and safe." However, the power plant construction mentioned above violates the construction procedures, wastes a large amount of state funds, and affects production. Therefore, it is recommended that the relevant leaders carefully examine and deal with this issue.

    一座百孔千疮的新电厂
    江希广
    山西省轩岗煤矿筹建处去年新建了一座发电厂。它的任务是供给煤矿基本建设的动力。但是由于设计和施工的质量太坏，这个电厂远远担负不起应负的重大任务。
    到今年二月三日止，这座发电厂已发生七十八处墙壁裂缝，其中最严重的是锅炉房，裂缝三十五处，全长二十三点八公尺，最宽的裂缝有四公厘。经过检查的十三根柱子，就有十二根有不同程度的下沉现象，最严重的十号柱子下沉三十公厘。污水井建筑在离厂房三点五公尺处，因为设计错误，污水不能流出，反而流回厂房里来侵蚀了基础。在污水井和厂房中间，离地面九十公分以上的土壤，用手捏起来就成了泥团，九十公分以下已变成稀泥了。由于以上原因，水泵房中靠近锅炉的地面已大部分下沉。
    机器安装质量也非常差。现在两部机器只能轮流开动，开动的那一部也只能使用六分之一的负荷。机器前后的标高，根据设计的要求，倾斜度应为万分之一，现在却为一百六十分之一。整个机器在歪扭着运转。管线安装不好，人们称它是“三漏”：汽管漏气、水管漏水、油管漏油。
    目前，电厂正采取紧急措施，在墙壁基础两侧加打小型木桩加固墙基，并作防水措施，争取能使墙面裂缝不继续扩大。机器也已重行拆掉，扩大基座支承面积，下面在加打木桩。结果浪费了大量资金，还严重地影响到其它工程的进度。例如煤矿钻探单位，原计划三月底完成钻探任务，由于电力供应不上，只好停工。
    发电厂工程质量不好的主要原因，是设计人员对这项工程的复杂性认识不足，存在盲目乐观情绪。开始设计时，只有一份不完整的图纸，设计人员认为稍加修改就可以了，最多二十天就能提出全部设计，因而施工单位就准备在二十天后开工了。事实上，当施工单位按照协商确定的时间提取图纸时，设计单位能拿出来的只是几份简简单单的厂房平面、立面和切面图，这当然是无法施工的。厂内机座和锅炉的基础工程，设计者不加设计，只用一张便条写上数字先拿去施工，详细尺寸要等以后陆续提出。这样，一面设计，一面施工，一直到完工后设计图纸还没有全部提出。据初步统计，正规图纸少于修改图纸，修改图纸少于原底草图，原底草图少于没有用比例尺随手画的图，随手画的图又少于口头通知或捎的口信。总之，是无图不改，无图不修，有的竟改了又改，修了又修。如果要问这件工程究竟用了多少设计图纸，至今还是一笔糊涂账。这种错误的做法，当然是难以保证工程质量的。
    发电厂工程质量不好的另一个原因是施工单位的技术监督不严，不根据设计要求和施工操作规程施工，同时也存在单纯任务观点，认为设计单位只要提出施工项目，不管是图纸、便条、或捎个口信，都可以施工，反正出了事故是设计单位的事，同自己无关。
    在施工过程中，由于设计人员不重视工人群众的意见，也造成很大浪费。例如原设计的机座面积不大，地基不好，老工人建议加打木桩，设计人员不但没有考虑这个意见，反而很骄傲地说：“这个设计已经过科学的计算了，又经济，又合理，你放心去施工吧！”但是到发生问题非修不可时，设计人员去现场转了一趟说：“这个问题很复杂，不好解决，回去请示后再作答复。”就这样一走了之。后经施工单位汇集群众意见，并草拟了“加打木桩扩大机座”的图纸和文字说明，设计人员才同意这个意见，并且提出根据机座的重量应再加大四倍。还有电厂用的烟囱，原机器附件是设计的四件铁制烟囱，每节九公尺多长，后来设计人员又叫少安一节，这一节到现在还倒在野地里。既然这样，在订货时为何不提出少买一节呢？类似这样的问题，据初步估计达一百六十多件。
    在我国的经济建设事业中，我们应该以最少的钱完成更多的任务，使一切建筑工程都达到“好、快、省、安全”的要求。但是，像上面所说的电厂建设，就违背了建设程序，浪费了国家大量资金，并影响了生产。因此，建议有关领导方面认真检查处理这个问题。
