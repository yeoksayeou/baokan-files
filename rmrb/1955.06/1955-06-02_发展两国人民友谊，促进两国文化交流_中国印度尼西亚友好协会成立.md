    Also present at the inaugural meeting were: Chu Tunan, Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Xiruo, Da Pongsheng, Wu Hongye, Zeng Zhaolun, Yang Hansheng, Lai Ruoyu, Zhang Yun, Qu Tangliang, heads of the initiating organizations of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, President Burhan Shahidi, Vice Presidents Hu Yuzhi and Ma Yuhuai and directors of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, as well as people from scientific, cultural, educational, and journalistic circles in the capital.

    Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech and reported on the preparation process of the association. He said: The China-Indonesia Friendship Association was jointly initiated by various people's organizations in China, and it was officially established on May 31 at a joint meeting of representatives of various people's organizations. Burhan Shahidi, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the China Islamic Association, was elected as President, Hu Yuzhi, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Ma Yuhuai, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, were elected as Vice Presidents, and 20 directors were elected.

    Burhan Shahidi, President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, delivered a speech, saying: We are very pleased that the Friendship Association was born precisely when His Excellency Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo of the Republic of Indonesia is visiting our country, and we are honored that this inaugural meeting has been graced by the presence of His Excellency Prime Minister and our Premier Zhou Enlai, which foreshadows the bright future of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association and will encourage us to work hard to fulfill its mission.

    Burhan Shahidi said: The China-Indonesia Friendship Association aims to develop friendly relations and cultural exchange between China and Indonesia. This aim inherits the tradition of cultural and friendly relations between the two countries and conforms to the common interests and demands of the two peoples. Therefore, there is no doubt that the establishment of the Friendship Association and its future work will not only be warmly welcomed and supported by the Chinese people but also receive the close attention and cooperation of the Indonesian people.

    After recounting the long history of friendly ties and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples, Burhan Shahidi pointed out that the friendship between the people of China and Indonesia has become deeper and stronger in the long struggle for national independence and national sovereignty; and since the successive establishment of the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China and the establishment of diplomatic relations, this friendship has been rapidly developing under new historical conditions. Recently, the mutual visits of our two Prime Ministers are an important symbol of the further deepening of the friendship between the two countries.

    Burhan Shahidi then talked about the development of cultural exchanges and trade relations between China and Indonesia in the past few years, and pointed out: The establishment of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association in Jakarta this January, headed by the distinguished Indonesian peace fighter Dr. Prijono, and the official establishment of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association today, form a strong bond of friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

    Burhan Shahidi said: The friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples is deep and strong. The Chinese people greatly admire the great contributions made by the Indonesian people in the cause of defending peace in recent years. For example, the great achievement of the Asian-African Conference is inseparable from the efforts of the Indonesian people. The Chinese people are determined to work with the Indonesian people to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their respective countries, to strive for and consolidate world peace, and to realize the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference and the joint statement of the two Prime Ministers. The joint statement of the Chinese and Indonesian Prime Ministers and the treaty between the two countries on the issue of dual nationality will further promote the friendly relations between the two peoples, and will surely play a more active role in promoting mutual economic and trade cooperation, cultural prosperity, and a happy and joyful life. There is no doubt that the Indonesia-China Friendship Association and the China-Indonesia Friendship Association will play their due role in promoting cultural cooperation between China and Indonesia.

    Indonesian Ambassador to China Mononutu then addressed the meeting, saying: I am very happy about the establishment of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, which is a concrete manifestation of the good relations between Indonesia and China. Mononutu talked about the development of economic and cultural cooperation between China and Indonesia, saying: Two years ago, the Indonesian government and the government of the People's Republic of China signed a trade agreement, followed by the signing of a protocol implementing the agreement. Last year, an Indonesian art troupe visited China, and an art troupe from the People's Republic of China will soon visit Indonesia. Not long ago, the Indonesian government and the Chinese government signed a treaty on dual nationality. Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China paid an official visit to Indonesia for several days after the Asian-African Conference. Now, Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo is returning that visit as a guest of the government of the People's Republic of China. Mononutu said: All this concretely proves the friendly relations between Indonesia and China. I believe that in other areas, such as in science, the two sides can also cooperate with each other. I hope that due to the establishment of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, the relations between these two neighboring countries will become closer for our common interests.

    At the meeting, a congratulatory message from the Indonesia-China Friendship Association was also read out, and a unanimous vote was passed to send a telegram to the Indonesia-China Friendship Association and the Indonesian people to express friendly respect.

    Then, Burhan Shahidi, on behalf of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, presented a gift to Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo and a gift to the Indonesia-China Friendship Association. The warm applause of the audience lasted for a long time.

    After the meeting, a reception was held. (Attached picture)

    中国印度尼西亚友好协会会长鲍尔汉致词，他说：我们感到非常高兴，友好协会恰好是在印度尼西亚共和国总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约阁下访问我国时诞生的，并且今天这个成立大会荣幸地获得了总理阁下和我国周恩来总理阁下的亲临参加，这预兆着中国印度尼西亚友好协会的光辉前途，并将鼓舞我们为完成它的使命而努力。
    鲍尔汉说：中国印度尼西亚友好协会以发展中国同印度尼西亚的友好关系和文化交流为宗旨。这
  个宗旨是继承了两国之间文化友好关系的传统，并符合两国人民的共同利益和要求的。因此，毫无疑
  问，友好协会的成立及其今后工作不仅将受到中国
  人民热烈的欢迎和支持，而且会获得印度尼西亚人
  民亲切的关怀和合作。
      鲍尔汉在追述了中国人民同印度尼西亚人民之
  间的悠久的友谊联系和文化交流的事实后，他指出
  中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的友谊在争取民族独立和国家主权的长期斗争中变得更加深厚和坚强；而自从印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国相继成立并建立邦交以后，这种友谊即在新的历史条件下得到迅速的发展。最近，我们两国总理的互相访问便是两国友谊进一步加深的重要标志。
    鲍尔汉接着谈到中国和印度尼西亚两国间的文化交流和贸易关系在过去几年中的发展，并指出：今年一月在雅加达成立的以杰出的印度尼西亚和平战士普里约诺博士为首的印度尼西亚中国友好协会，和今天中国印度尼西亚友好协会的正式成立，就形成了两国人民之间的坚强的友谊的韧带。

    印度尼西亚驻我国大使莫诺努图接着在会上致词说：对于中国印度尼西亚友好协会的成立我感到很高兴，这是印度尼西亚和中国两国之间的良好关系的具体表现。莫诺努图谈到中国和印度尼西亚的经济和文化合作关系的发展，他说：两年以前，印度尼西亚政府和中华人民共和国政府已签订了贸易协定，接着又签订了实施协定的议定书。去年，印度尼西亚艺术团访问了中国，中华人民共和国艺术团在不久也将访问印度尼西亚。不久前，印度尼西亚政府和中国政府已签订了关于双重国籍的条约。中华人民共和国总理周恩来阁下在亚非会议以后在印度尼西亚作了几天的正式访问。现在，阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理阁下作为中华人民共和国政府的贵宾酬答那一次的访问。莫诺努图说：这一切具体证明了印度尼西亚和中国之间的友好关系。我相信，在其他方面，例如在科学方面双方也可以互相合作。我希望由于中国印度尼西亚友好协会的成立，为了我们的共同利益，这两个邻国的关系将更加密切。
    在大会上，还宣读了印度尼西亚中国友好协会发来的贺电，并一致通过致电向印度尼西亚中国友好协会和印度尼西亚人民致以友谊的敬意。
    接着，鲍尔汉代表中国印度尼西亚友好协会向阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理献礼和向印度尼西亚中国友好协会赠礼。全场热烈的掌声历久不息。
