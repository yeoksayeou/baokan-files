    Verifying Grain Supply: Enough to Eat and Save
    Wu Guizhi, Resident of Yizhong Lane, Hualou Street, Wuhan

    This time, the implementation of planned grain supply based on household verification in Wuhan gave me a great education.

    On May 11th, when the household registration police comrade brought the grain purchase certificate with the verified amount to my home, he said that we could buy 76 jin of grain each month. When I heard this, I panicked. I thought about my family of four: my younger son and I each eat two large bowls of vegetables with rice per meal, and my elderly mother, who is over sixty, can eat three bowls of rice per meal. Before, we used to cook three jin of rice every day, which meant we would be short more than ten jin of rice per month. I didn't say it out loud at the time, but I was extremely worried.

    The next day, I calculated that 76 jin of rice divided by 30 days is about two and a half jin per day, so that day I cooked two and a half jin of rice. Fearing it wouldn't be enough, I also bought some tofu and eggs and made several large bowls of soup. Who knew that the whole family would still be full that day? The next day was a Sunday, and I still weighed out two and a half jin of rice to cook, but coincidentally, my eldest son returned from the factory in Wuchang, so I added a few handfuls of rice (about five liang) and cooked it together, telling my son to eat as much as he could. After eating that day, there were still two bowls of rice left over. The next day, I only steamed two jin and three liang of rice together with the leftover rice, and the whole family was full. From then on, I cooked according to the standard of two and a half jin of rice per day. Now, the facts prove that this amount is truly enough to eat.

    At first, I was also very surprised. How could we eat less rice but still be full? After carefully thinking about the past, I understood. It turned out that although we said we needed three jin of rice every day, we didn't actually need that much, and there was often some rice left over. Sometimes, when there was a lot of rice left over, we would eat the leftover rice for a whole day. So, on the surface, we needed three jin of rice every day, but we didn't actually eat that much. And let's talk about buying rice! On the 25th of each month, when my husband received his salary, he would always buy some rice to keep at home, no matter how much rice we already had in storage. If we saw rice that we liked, we would buy more of it. So, in the past, my family bought a lot of rice and cooked a lot of rice, but we didn't actually need to eat that much.

    After the actual experiment proved that the verified amount of rice supply is enough to eat, I realized the benefits of the government's implementation of planned grain supply based on household verification. It's so good that we can eat our fill, buy less rice, save money, and conserve grain for the country! The country's grain supply is planned, and disrupting that plan will affect national construction and people's lives. Let's take our family's daily life as an example: my family's monthly income is 46 yuan, and we rely on good planning, calculating everything carefully, so that we can ensure that the whole family has enough to eat and wear, and we can even save some money each month. Otherwise, even twice as much money would not be enough to spend. The affairs of the country are even more important. With so many people in the country, thousands of households, if everyone didn't follow the plan, how much more grain would be consumed in a year? Grain that could clearly ensure that everyone has enough to eat would become insufficient. Moreover, it is not easy to transport grain from the countryside. My husband works on a ship and used to frequently transport grain to western Hubei. I know this; it costs the country a lot of money for each trip. If we waste grain, the country has to spend more freight to transfer grain, which is a huge loss. The implementation of planned grain supply based on household verification is really a good method. It not only ensures that everyone can eat their fill, but also avoids wasting grain, saving grain to support national construction of factories, so that we can live a better life in the future.

### 核实供应的粮食又够吃又节省

    核实供应的粮食又够吃又节省
    武汉市花楼街亿中里居民  吴桂枝
    这次武汉市实行粮食按户核实计划供应，给了我一次很大的教育。
    五月十一日那天，户籍警同志把核实了数字的购粮证送到我家来时，说每月可以买七十六斤粮食；我一听心里就慌起来了。想到一家四口人吃饭，我和小儿子每餐都是吃两大菜碗，六十多岁的老太婆一餐也能吃三饭碗饭，从前家里每天都要煮三斤米的饭，照这算下来一个月就差十几斤米。当时嘴里没说出来，可是担心的不得了。
    第二天，我把七十六斤米按三十天一算，一天大约两斤半，这天烧饭就按两斤半米下锅；怕不够吃，又买了几块豆腐和鸡蛋做了几大碗汤。谁知道那天一家老小还是都吃饱了。再过一天是个星期天，我还是称的两斤半米去煮，可是恰恰我的大儿子从武昌厂里回来了，我就另外添了几把米（五两左右）合着煮，叫儿子尽量吃饱。这天吃下来，还剩了两碗饭。到第二天，我只把两斤三两米连同剩下的饭一起蒸，结果一家人都吃得饱饱的。以后每天我就按两斤半米的标准煮。现在事实证明，有这些，是真正足够吃饱了。
    起先我自己也很奇怪，怎么米用少了，人还是照样能吃饱肚子呢？把从前的情形仔细一想才明白了。原来以前明说是每天三斤米，可是实际并不需要那么多，经常总是剩下一些饭。有时饭剩多了，就吃一天现饭。所以表面上是每天得三斤米，其实并没有吃到那些。再拿买米说吧！每月二十五日我的爱人领到工薪时，不管家里还存着多少米，总要去买些米回来压着。看到合口味的米到了，也要多买一些回来。所以，从前我家里是买的米多，煮的米多，其实并不需要吃那么多。
    经过实际试验证明核实供应的米是够吃的，我才晓得政府实行粮食按户核实计划供应的好处。自己吃饱了，少买些米又省钱又为国家节约了粮食，这该多好！国家的粮食是有计划的，打乱了那个计划就要影响国家建设和人民生活。就拿我们家里过日子的事打比方吧：我家一个月收入四十六元，全靠我们计划的好，一针一线都算得好好的，这样一家大小的穿衣吃饭都保得住，并且每月还能剩一些钱。要不然，再多一倍的钱也不够花。国家的事更不消说得，全国这么多人，千家万户的，要是都不按计划，一年要多销多少粮食？明明能保证人人够吃的粮食，也会弄得不够了。再说，粮食从乡里运出来也不容易，我爱人在轮船上工作，以前时常到鄂西去运粮，这一点我晓得，运一趟国家花的钱真不少。我们浪费粮食，还要国家多花运费调运粮食，那损失就太大了。实行粮食按户核实计划供应真是个好办法，它不光保证每个人可以吃饱饭，还可以免得浪费粮食，节约下粮食来支援国家建设工厂，使我们将来能过更好的日子。（十立记）
