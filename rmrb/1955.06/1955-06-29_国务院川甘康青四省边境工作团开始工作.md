Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 27th. The State Council's Border Work Group of Sichuan, Gansu, Kangding, and Qinghai Provinces invited more than 40 Tibetan and Hui ethnic leaders, Lamas, and Ahongs from the border regions of the four provinces to a forum in Aba on the 24th. Zhang Chenwu, Deputy Head of the Work Group, introduced the Work Group's tasks in the border areas. He said that in the past few years since liberation, under the brilliant illumination of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies, various tasks in the border areas of the four provinces have made great progress. The Work Group will cooperate with the Party committees and governments in the border areas of the four provinces, closely rely on the people and unite with the leading figures who have ties with the people, to further deeply publicize the ethnic policies; assist local governments in strengthening the work of ethnic unity; and cooperate with local governments to carry out planned and gradual production and construction work that is possible and necessary. Several Tibetan members of the Aba People's Government and Lamas and Ahongs from monasteries spoke one after another. They unanimously expressed their willingness to actively support and assist the Work Group in its work, so that the people on the borders of the four provinces can unite like brothers and sisters and build a better life together.

Prior to this, the Work Group had received and visited more than 30 Tibetan headmen, monastery Lamas, and Ahongs in the border areas. The Work Group exchanged views with them on issues such as ethnic unity and commercial trade in the border areas. Those who were visited and received also provided the Work Group with a great deal of information about the border areas.
