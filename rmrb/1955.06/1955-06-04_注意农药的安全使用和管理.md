Pay Attention to the Safe Use and Management of Pesticides
    Tian Jia
    In the process of pesticide management, storage, and use, many poisoning, injury, and death accidents involving humans and animals have occurred over the years; especially in areas where red and white arsenic and "1605" are used, poisoning accidents are more serious. According to incomplete statistics from five special districts in Henan Province, nearly two hundred people were poisoned last year. In areas of Hebei Province where "1605" is used, injury and death accidents have occurred year after year. In order to effectively control cotton aphids and ensure increased cotton production, the supply of "1605" pesticide will be greatly increased this year compared to the past, and the scope of use will also be expanded. Therefore, the safety issues in pesticide use and management must be given great attention.
    The main reasons for the occurrence of poisoning are insufficient publicity regarding pesticide use techniques and lax management. For example, some places leave pesticides lying around, causing them to be mixed into food and drinks, leading to poisoning after consumption. Due to the lack of widespread and in-depth teaching and guidance on pesticide use techniques, some farmers do not take precautions against poisoning during the use of pesticides, even using their hands to mix or dip pesticides, and some use utensils that have not been thoroughly cleaned or detoxified to hold food, resulting in poisoning. Some agricultural departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas do not pay enough attention to the issue of preventing poisoning, often only shouting "prevent poisoning" without seriously taking effective measures to prevent poisoning. This practice is very wrong.
    As long as leading organs and the masses overcome complacency and pay attention to poison prevention, unfortunate pesticide poisoning incidents can be completely avoided. The agricultural production cooperative led by Kou Dalai in Sigang Township, Xihua County, Henan Province, and the mutual aid group led by Zhang Pingyi in Zhoulou Township, etc., have not had any pesticide poisoning accidents last year because they adopted measures such as unified use, unified processing, and centralized storage of pesticides.
    According to the experiences of various places, the work of preventing poisoning should be strengthened in the following aspects: First, strict management should be carried out for various medicines and machinery, especially for highly toxic pesticides such as "1605." Strict storage and use methods must be stipulated. Landlords and other bad elements should not be allowed to purchase this type of highly toxic drug; nor should private merchants be allowed to operate it. When farmers need to purchase this type of medicine, they should have an introduction letter from the People's Committee before it can be sold to them. Mutual aid and cooperative organizations or individual farmers using pesticides shall not resell pesticides. Second, units responsible for selling pesticides must have dedicated personnel responsible for storage, sales, and other work. The user unit should designate a dedicated person to prepare the medicine; attention should be paid to storing pesticide stock solutions, diluted solutions, powders, seeds mixed with medicine, powders, etc., separately to avoid mixing with other items. Children should not be allowed to enter the place where pesticides are stored and mess with the medicines. Third, in addition to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups implementing the method of collective purchase and collective use of pesticides, individual farmers can also be mobilized to form temporary insecticide spraying teams, so that dedicated personnel can be responsible for medicine preparation, spraying, and other work. It is easy to master the use technology, and the storage can also be done by dedicated personnel. In order to ensure safety, the use of "1605" pesticide should currently be limited to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups with technical conditions. Fourth, agricultural departments and supply and marketing cooperatives should strengthen the teaching of pesticide use technology, and clearly explain the nature and effectiveness of various pesticides to farmers; but do not exaggerate the harm of pesticides, so as not to scare farmers from using them. In order to do this work well, various places can plan to hold pesticide machinery technology training classes. Areas using "1605" can also specifically hold short-term safety use teaching classes to train personnel who can correctly master pesticide use technology.

    注意农药的安全使用和管理
    田稼
    在农药的经营、保管和使用过程中，历年都发生过不少的人、畜中毒、伤亡事故；特别是在使用红、白砒和“一六○五”的地区，中毒事故更严重。据河南省五个专区的不完全统计，去年有近二百人中毒。河北省使用“一六○五”的地区，连年发生伤亡事故。为了有效地除治棉蚜，保证棉花增产，今年“一六○五”农药的供应量将比过去大大增加，使用地区范围也将扩大，因此，对于农药使用和管理中的安全问题，必须十分注意。
    发生中毒现象的主要原因，是对农药使用技术宣传不够和管理不严。例如有的地方把农药随处乱放，致使农药混到食物和饮料里面，人们饮食后就中毒。由于没有普遍、深入地传授和指导农药的使用技术，有的农民在使用农药过程中，没有作好防范中毒的工作，甚至用手拌药或蘸药，有的使用未经充分清洗或解毒的盛药用具盛食物，以致中毒。有些地区的农业部门和供销合作部门对于防止中毒的问题重视不够，往往只空喊“防止中毒”，却不认真采取防止中毒的有效措施，这种做法是非常错误的。
    只要从领导机关到群众都克服麻痹思想，注意防毒，农药中毒的不幸事件是完全可以避免的。河南省西华县四岗乡寇大来领导的农业生产合作社和周楼乡张平一领导的互助组等，因为采取了农药统一使用、统一加工和集中保管等措施，去年一年没有发生农药中毒事故。
    根据各地的经验，应该从以下几个方面加强防范中毒的工作：第一，对各种药械要严格管理，尤其是对于毒性大的“一六○五”等农药，必须规定严格保管和使用办法。这类毒性大的药品，不能允许地主和其他坏分子购买；也不应让私商经营。农民需要购买这种药剂时，应有人民委员会的介绍信，才能卖给。使用农药的互助合作组织或个体农户不能转售农药。第二，负责销售农药的单位，必须有专人负责保管、出售等工作。使用单位应指定专人配药；对于农药的原液、稀释液、药粉、拌过药的种籽、药粉等，应注意单独存放，避免同其他物品混杂。存放农药的地点，不要让小孩进去乱动药剂。第三，除了农业生产合作社和互助组对于农药应当实行集体购买、集体使用的办法外，还可动员个体农民组成临时性的施药治虫小组，这样可以有专人负责配药、喷药等工作，容易掌握使用技术，保管上也可做到专人负责。为了保证安全，“一六○五”农药的使用，目前应限定在有技术条件的农业生产合作社和互助组。第四，农业部门和供销合作部门应加强对农药使用技术的传授工作，要向农民清楚说明各种农药的性质和效用；但不要夸大农药的毒害，以免农民不敢使用。为了做好这件工作，各地可以有计划地举办农药械技术训练班，使用“一六○五”的地区，还可以专门举办短期的安全使用传授班，培养能够正确掌握农药使用技术的人员。
