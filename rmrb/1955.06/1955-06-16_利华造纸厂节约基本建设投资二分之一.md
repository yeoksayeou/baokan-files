    Li Hua Paper Mill Saves Half of Basic Construction Investment
    By our reporter Ji Yin
    The Chinese Communist Party organization at the state-owned Li Hua Paper Mill in Shanghai launched a mass inspection and discussion of the factory's basic construction investment plan for this year and next in April. During the inspection, they discovered that the factory's basic construction plan had significant waste. In the fourteen projects, many items lacked a basis, were optional, or could be compressed. The total basic construction investment could be reduced by half.
    Why was a factory's basic construction plan so unable to withstand scrutiny, to the extent that half could be cut? This must be explained by how the plan was created.
    Li Hua Paper Mill is an old factory with more than fifty years of history, and many of its facilities are outdated. Due to production needs, appropriate and necessary basic construction is permissible. Last March, Soviet experts visited the factory and suggested some local improvements to certain irrational aspects of the factory. This suggestion was approved by the higher-level leadership. These suggestions were also correct. However, during the process of formulating the basic construction plan based on this suggestion, the leaders of Li Hua Paper Mill did not pay attention to fully utilizing existing equipment, saving national construction funds, and limiting basic construction to a certain scope. Instead, they attempted to completely renovate the factory through this construction. Therefore, the plan was greatly distorted. It was no longer making local improvements based on production needs, but became a massive comprehensive renovation plan. Thoroughly renovate the factory buildings, completely replace old equipment, add new machines, build canteens, dormitories, and roads... All kinds of projects, regardless of importance or urgency, were included. After receiving this plan, the Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry did not seriously review it, but only reduced the planned investment from 3 million yuan to 1.85 million yuan. Later, when Li Hua Paper Mill carried out the detailed design, the investment figure reached about 2.5 million yuan.
    In February of this year, at an enlarged meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the mistakes of blindly developing certain industrial enterprises in Shanghai were criticized, and it was demanded that such behavior, which disregards the overall interests of the country, be stopped immediately. The responsible comrades of the State-Owned Industry Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee conveyed this instruction to the leaders of state-owned enterprises throughout the city. The director and Party Secretary of Li Hua Paper Mill couldn't sit still after hearing half of it. They couldn't help but immediately think about the situation in their own factory. Until this moment, they really had no idea about the enormous basic construction plan in their factory. After the Party Secretary returned to the factory, he asked two engineering and technical personnel to get to the bottom of it. These two comrades truthfully provided many facts about the serious waste in the factory's basic construction. Later, the Party Secretary also held symposiums with workshop leaders, technicians, and workers to further inspect and discuss. This hastily formulated and hastily approved basic construction plan was revealed to be full of loopholes. For example, the repair workshop has existing lathes that have not been fully utilized, and are still only operating during the day shift, but the plan included adding 50,000 yuan worth of lathe equipment. Another example is the renovation of the paper-making workshop and the construction of family dormitories, which had a total planned investment of 350,000 yuan, and were also optional. There were even some projects that were difficult to implement. After mass inspection, half of the factory's fourteen major basic construction projects could be cancelled.
    Why were these projects included in the construction plan? What guiding ideology was behind them? The comrades at Li Hua Paper Mill also traced the root causes ideologically.
    First, a formalistic ideology that disregards economic results. Basic construction does not explicitly serve to improve production, but only pursues so-called "advanced standards" in form. In reality, it is about showing off and looking good. Several items in Li Hua Paper Mill's basic construction plan fall into this category. For example, the major renovation of the paper-making workshop, which involved lengthening the copper mesh of the No. 1 paper machine, changing the pulp tank from vertical to horizontal, expanding the factory building, raising the drying cylinder of the No. 3 paper machine, and installing a second press roll. This project was huge, and production in the workshop would have to be stopped for several months as a result. However, this project was not necessary for current production, because production in this workshop is now relatively normal, and there is no need for major renovations. It was only after some people visited some paper mills with better equipment that they felt that the equipment in their factory was too old-fashioned, and that they "had to catch up with advanced factories." Therefore, they proposed this huge plan. Another huge plan was to change the original screening equipment to air-separation equipment, build a three-story building, and purchase many complex devices. This was also proposed after some people visited a large paper mill in the Northeast and saw that the air-separation equipment was very good. In reality, the raw material used by that factory to make paper was grass and reeds, which required air separation, while the raw material used by Li Hua Paper Mill was rice straw, which could be completely handled by screening. In addition, seeing that the water tower in another paper mill was more than 100 feet high and their own water tower was low, they wanted to raise the water tower and install an expensive and unnecessary spiral staircase.
    Second is the ideology of "equipment first." The idea that the only way to improve product quality and reduce costs is to rely on adding new machinery and equipment, while neglecting how to rely on the wisdom of the masses to improve operating methods and improve the utilization of old equipment. The white water recovery project is an example. White water recovery is a problem that Li Hua Paper Mill needs to solve, because it flushes away more than 100,000 yuan worth of recoverable paper-making raw materials every year. Early on, some workers proposed using existing pipelines and making some partial modifications, without undertaking new construction projects, but this correct suggestion was not taken seriously. It was not until this inspection that the project was cancelled, saving more than 40,000 yuan.
    Third is localism and a lack of a holistic perspective. Some basic construction projects at Li Hua Paper Mill were proposed simply because some workshops saw that other workshops had basic construction projects, and felt that they would be "too disadvantaged" and "lose face" if they didn't propose a few. During this inspection, the director of the repair workshop said: "I saw that other workshops had projects, and my own workshop didn't, so I proposed adding a lathe and a milling machine, but in reality, our existing lathes are sufficient." The two directors of the paper-making workshop also admitted that they proposed some projects at the time simply because they felt that "it would be too disadvantageous not to add some equipment and spend some money." In the original basic construction plan, there was a major project to add a boiler, requiring an investment of 400,000 yuan. However, in another factory next door, there were two surplus boilers that were about to be shut down. Someone had suggested using the old boilers from the sister factory, but initially, the factory felt that it was not proper to use "other people's" boilers, and it was better to build a new one themselves. After this inspection, it has now been decided to cut this project. As long as a pipe is installed, the steam from the sister factory's boilers can be transported over, saving 400,000 yuan.
    Fourth is the conservative mentality of wide planning and wide usage. Regardless of equipment, factory buildings, or machinery, they are not accurately calculated based on actual needs, but are always made wider and purchased more. For example, the power workshop of Li Hua Paper Mill proposed in this basic construction plan to establish two sets of motors, one for direct current and one for alternating current, on the grounds of "precaution," which is actually unnecessary based on the situation in Shanghai. If every factory took such "precautions," the state would have to spend an enormous amount of money. Another example is that the plan proposed to order a 190-pound furnace, but in reality, a 100-pound furnace is not needed, also on the grounds of being "more secure."
    All of the above-mentioned ideas can be summarized into one problem: a lack of clear understanding of the fundamental policy of relying on internal accumulation to build socialist industry. Therefore, they have neither established the concept of actively exploring the potential of existing equipment, nor the concept of increasing accumulation for the country, nor the concept of saving expenses for the country. The leaders of Li Hua Paper Mill received a good education during this inspection. They said: When studying the general line, everyone raised their hands in approval of the principles of concentrating funds on building heavy industry, and of old enterprises practicing strict thrift and tapping potential. However, when they came into contact with practical work, many people became confused. Now, looking back, isn't our blind construction and waste of national funds a violation of the spirit of the general line?
    After the inspection, the basic construction plan of Li Hua Paper Mill has now been revised. Many unnecessary or optional projects have been cancelled, and some projects that need to be done but can save money have also been rationally reduced without affecting production. It is estimated that this will save more than one million yuan in total. If the original basic construction plan had been implemented, several important departments in the factory would have had to partially stop production this year, and the annual production plan would have been seriously affected. Now that the plan has been revised, the annual production can still proceed normally.

    利华造纸厂节约基本建设投资二分之一
    本报记者　季音
    上海国营利华造纸厂的中共党组织，在今年四月间对这个厂今、明两年的基本建设投资计划，展开了一次群众性的检查和讨论。在检查中他们发现厂的基本建设计划有很大的浪费，在十四项工程中，有许多项目都是缺乏根据的、可建可不建的、或者可以压缩的。基本建设投资总额足可削减一半。
    为什么一个工厂的基本建设计划竟这样经不起检查，以致有一半可以削减呢？这得从这个计划的产生经过说起。
    利华造纸厂是一个已有五十多年历史的老厂，许多设备都很陈旧了。由于生产的需要，适当地进行些必需的基本建设是可以的。去年三月，苏联专家参观了工厂以后，建议将厂内某些不合理的部分作些局部性的改造，这个建议得到了上级领导机关的同意。这些建议也是正确的。但是在根据这个建议制定基本建设计划的过程中，利华造纸厂的领导人员没有注意充分利用旧有设备、节约国家建设资金，尽量把基本建设约束在一定的范围以内，而是企图通过这项建设把工厂全面翻新一下。于是计划就大大地走了样，它已经不是根据生产的必须作些局部的改造，而成了一个庞大的全面改造计划。彻底翻修厂房啦，全部改换旧设备啦，添置新机器啦，兴建食堂、宿舍、马路啦，……各种项目，不管轻重缓急都被列进去了。轻工业部造纸工业局接到这个计划以后，也没有认真审核，只是把计划投资三百万元减为一百八十五万元。以后利华造纸厂在具体进行设计时，投资数字又达到二百五十万元左右。
    今年二月，在中共上海市委员会的一次扩大会议上，批判了上海市某些工业企业盲目发展的错误，要求立即停止这种不顾国家整体利益的行为。中共上海市委国营工业部的负责同志向全市国营企业领导人员传达了这个指示。利华造纸厂厂长和党委书记听到一半，就沉不住气了，他们不能不立即想到自己厂里的情形，直到此刻，他们对于自己厂内庞大的基本建设计划，实在还心中无数。党委书记回到厂里，就找了两位工程技术人员摸底，这两个同志如实地提供了许多本厂基本建设中严重浪费的事实。以后党委书记又分别召开了车间领导人员、技术人员和工人座谈会，进一步来检查和讨论，这个轻率地制定和轻率地被批准的基本建设计划，便处处露出漏洞来了。例如修理车间现有车床还没有充分利用，至今只开日班，但在计划里却增添五万元的车床设备。又如造纸车间的改造，和家属宿舍的建设，共计划三十五万元投资，也是可用可不用的。还有些项目甚至是很难实现的。经群众检查后，全厂十四大项的基本建设计划，足有一半可以取消。
    为什么这些项目会被提到建设计划上去的呢？它是什么思想指导的呢？利华造纸厂的同志在思想上也追了根。
    第一，不问经济效果的形式主义思想。基本建设不是明确地为提高生产服务，而只是追求形式上的所谓“先进标准”，实际上是讲排场，图好看。利华造纸厂的基本建设计划有好几项是属于这一类的。例如造纸车间的大改造，要把一号纸机的铜网放长，浆桶由立式改为卧式，将厂房扩大，三号纸机烘缸抬高，装置第二道压榨辊，这个工程很庞大，车间生产要因此停止几个月。但是这项工程却不是当前生产所必需的，因为这个车间的生产现在已比较正常，完全不必大改造。只是有些人参观了一些设备较好的纸厂以后，觉得本厂的设备太旧式了，
  “得向先进厂看齐”，于是便提出了这个庞大的计划。另一个庞大的计划是将原来的筛选设备改为风选设备，要盖一幢三层大楼，购置许多复杂的设备。这也是有些人在东北参观了一个大纸厂，看到风选设备很好以后提出的，实际上那个厂造纸的原料是草苇，需要风选，而利华造纸厂用的原料是稻草，用筛选已完全可以了。另外，如看到别的纸厂水塔有一百多尺高，自己的水塔低，就要把水塔提高，并且准备装上既费钱又不必要的螺旋式的楼梯。
    第二是“设备第一”的思想。认为要提高产品质量，降低成本，唯一的办法就是依靠增加新的机器设备，却忽视了如何依靠群众的智慧，来改进操作方法，改善旧设备的利用状况。白水回收工程是一个例子。白水回收是利华造纸厂需要解决的一个问题，因为它每年都要冲掉价值十余万元可以回收的造纸原料。很早就有职工提出利用旧有的管道，加以部分改造，不必搞新建设工程，但这个正确的建议没有被重视。直到这次检查后，才取消了这项工程，省去了四万元以上。
    第三是本位主义，缺乏整体观念的思想。利华纸厂有些基本建设项目的提出，仅仅是因为有的车间看到别的车间有基本建设项目，认为自己不提出几项就“太吃亏”，“脸上无光”。在这次检查中，修理车间主任说：“我看到别的车间都有项目，自己车间没有，也就提出要增加一部车床和一部铣床，实际上我们现有的车床足够用了”。造纸车间的两个主任也承认，当时提出一些项目，只是因为感到“不增添些设备，不花些钱，太吃亏”。在原基本建设计划中有一项增添一台锅炉的大工程，需投资四十万元，但是就在隔壁的另一家工厂里，却多余两台锅炉，要封闭掉。有人曾建议利用兄弟厂的旧锅炉，但最初厂里认为用“人家”的锅炉不像样，不如自己搞个新的。经这次检查后，现在已决定削减这个项目，只要安装一根管子，就可以把兄弟厂锅炉的蒸汽输送过来，四十万元就可以省下了。
    第四是宽打宽用的保守思想，无论设备、厂房、机器都不是根据实际需要来精确计算，而是处处打得宽一些，购置得多一些。例如利华造纸厂动力车间在这次基本建设计划中提出要建立直流电、交流电的两套马达，理由是“以防万一”，其实根据上海的情况是不需要的，如果个个厂都这样“以防万一”，国家就不知要支出多么巨大的一笔资金。又如计划中提出要订一个一百九十磅的炉子，实际上用不到一百磅，理由也是“保险一点”。
    所有上述这些思想，归纳起来只是一个问题，就是对依靠内部积累来建设社会主义工业的根本方针认识不清，所以既没有树立积极发掘现有设备潜力的观念，为国家增加积累的观念，也没有树立为国家节约开支的观念。利华造纸厂的领导人员这次在检查中都受到了很好的教育。他们说：在学习总路线的时候，对集中资金建设重工业，旧有企业应当厉行节约、发掘潜力等原则，大家都是举手赞成的，但是当一接触到实际工作，许多人又昏了头，现在回头来想想，我们这样盲目地建设，耗费国家资金，不是违背了总路线的精神了么？
    检查后，利华纸厂的基本建设计划现在已经修改，许多不需要的或者可做可不做的项目都取消了，有些要做的但可以省钱的，也在不妨碍生产的前提下合理地削减了。据估计这样一共可节约一百万元以上。如果按照原来的基本建设计划进行，今年厂内的若干重要部门要局部停止生产，全年生产计划将受严重影响，现在计划修改后，全年生产仍可正常进行。
