Henan Province is widely utilizing irrigation canals along the Yellow River and wells to sow late autumn crops. The Yellow River irrigation canals were opened on June 4th to ensure the timely sowing of over 300,000 mu of late autumn crops in the irrigation areas. A surge in well-digging for irrigation has emerged in counties such as Wenxian, Junxian, and Yanjin. In Yanjin County, after harvesting over 800,000 mu of wheat, farmers are fighting the drought to sow over 700,000 mu of late autumn crops. In addition to building brick wells and repairing old wells, the county has newly dug over 400 earthen wells. Farmers in Hedao Township, recalling the stark contrast between reduced yields due to waiting for rain in previous autumn plantings and the bountiful harvests achieved through drought resistance, are enthusiastically engaged in drought-resistant planting activities across the township's four agricultural production cooperatives, seven mutual aid teams, and sixty individual farming households. In the suburbs of Zhengzhou, some agricultural production cooperative members are tirelessly watering and planting corn day and night. The Red Light Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liulin Township saw a general increase in income from the preliminary distribution during the wheat season, which boosted the members' enthusiasm for labor. When the Zhengzhou Agricultural Machinery Station's tractors arrived on June 4th to assist with summer cultivation, teams of farmers were already digging ditches and storing water along the banks of the Wei River north of the village in preparation for planting sweet potatoes. The drought-resistant sowing activities of farmers along the Huai River are also becoming more active day by day. In Wuyang County, the three agricultural production cooperatives in Luguo Township are leading farmers throughout the township to shift away from relying on rain and are installing more than fifty waterwheels to carry out drought-resistant planting. The newly built Baisha Irrigation Canal project in Yuxian County will be officially opened for water release soon. Local farmers are joyfully preparing to use the Baisha Reservoir's stored water for drought-resistant planting for the first time ever.

    河南农民抗旱播种晚秋作物
    河南省广泛利用黄河两岸的灌溉渠道和水井播种晚秋作物。引黄灌溉渠已于六月四日开闸放水，保证灌区三十多万亩晚秋作物适时播种。温县、浚县、延津等县挖井浇地已形成热潮，延津县八十多万亩小麦收割后，农民们正在抗旱播种七十多万亩晚秋作物，全县除打砖井修旧井外，现已新挖土井四百多眼。河道乡农民回忆对比了往年种秋时等雨减了产、抗旱获丰收的鲜明事实，全乡四个农业生产合作社、七个互助组和六十户单干农民热烈展开了抗旱点种活动。郑州市郊区有些农业生产合作社的社员日夜不停地浇水种玉米，柳林乡红光农业生产合作社麦季预分普遍增加收入，鼓舞了社员的劳动热情，六月四日当给这个社进行夏耕的郑州农业机器站的拖拉机到达时，成队的农民已在村北的卫河岸边挖沟存水准备栽红薯了。淮河沿岸广大农民的抗旱播种活动也一天比一天活跃，舞阳县芦郭乡三个农业生产合作社带动全乡农民扭转了靠天等雨思想，全乡安装了五十多部水车开展抗旱抢种。禹县境内新建的白沙灌溉渠工程将于最近正式放水，当地农民在欢欣鼓舞地准备破天荒第一次利用白沙水库的蓄水抗旱播种。
