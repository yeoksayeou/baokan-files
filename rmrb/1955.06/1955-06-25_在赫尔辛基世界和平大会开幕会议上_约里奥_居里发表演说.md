Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, June 23rd (TASS dispatch): Joliot-Curie, President of the World Peace Council, delivered a speech at the opening meeting of the World Peace Congress in Helsinki on the 22nd.

    He said that after many years of work in various countries, and under the influence of various factors, a great and extremely great force is exerting an ever-increasing influence: public opinion. In these days, we will see people from many different countries, who probably have different views on the history of recent years, express their wishes to each other. This expression of wishes to each other will certainly lead to better understanding and unfold a clearer, more powerful, and more resolute effort to establish a genuine atmosphere of peace and a relaxation of international tension in the near future – through many concrete actions.

    No one can deny that the demand of the people of all countries in the world today is to prevent war. This demand should be met... Generally speaking, the international situation has improved during the past year. The statements issued by governments, the written or oral talks made by influential people, and the increasing number of articles published in newspapers around the world are all in line with the most sincere wishes of people everywhere; these are the factors that ease international tension.

    Joliot-Curie then recounted events such as the Berlin Four-Power Conference, which decided to convene the Geneva Conference.

    The Geneva Conference is different from the Manila Conference. The Manila Conference concluded with the signing of a military treaty that would divide the world into hostile blocs. This military alliance shattered many of the hopes generated by the Geneva Conference and became part of the "position of strength" policy.

    Later, another conference that attracted worldwide attention was held in Bandung. This conference signed important economic, cultural, and political agreements; the ten principles adopted by this conference are a true charter of peaceful coexistence.

    One could have hoped that a similar approach would be chosen to try to peacefully resolve the German question, choosing a path leading to the establishment of collective security within the framework of the United Nations Charter. However, the London Agreements and the Paris Agreements were signed and ratified, thereby allowing the Federal Republic of Germany to remilitarize, to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and to establish a Western alliance.

    Joliot-Curie continued: The London and Paris Agreements reflect the pursuit of a "position of strength." These agreements deepened the division of the world into blocs.

    Joliot-Curie categorically refuted the argument that the "position of strength" established in this way resulted in a series of steps and proposals that provided opportunities to ease international tension. He said that this was a reversal of right and wrong. The Paris Agreements are in fact a serious obstacle to easing tension.

    He pointed out that some governments believe that by arbitrarily adjusting the intensity of the Cold War, they can obtain a means to avoid financial crises. They believe that proving the legitimacy of this arms policy, which brings profits to certain groups, in front of world public opinion, is a means of exerting effective pressure in their internal and foreign policies.

    When many people hope that negotiations will free them from terror, it seems to me extremely important to determine what meaning the word "negotiation" has. In my opinion, to establish a "position of strength" in order to predetermine the outcome of international negotiations means pursuing a policy of ultimatum, not a policy of negotiation.

    Starting from the premise that conspiracy, pressure, and threats should never be allowed to exacerbate the current tension, I believe that the purpose of negotiations should be to seek decisions that are acceptable to all parties concerned through mutual concessions.

    Joliot-Curie reminded the delegates of the achievements made in the negotiations for the Austrian State Treaty. He said that in other countries, broad sections of the public believe that this independence, which is conducive to the establishment of effective relations between countries with different political systems, is an important factor for peace.

    He went on to say that due to the vigorous actions of the forces of peace, many people who once thought that war was inevitable are now beginning to abandon this idea.

    The passive sentiment of world opinion is constantly being replaced by an increasingly persistent and therefore increasingly firm belief: war can be resisted. Joliot-Curie emphasized: This belief is constantly growing and expanding, because the terrible consequences of the Second World War are still fresh in people's minds, and because the significance of weapons of mass destruction is becoming increasingly clear.

    Since 1945, some people have been spreading all kinds of terror about the damage that atomic and hydrogen bombs can cause, in order to exert political pressure that is actually a real blackmail. This blackmail initially had some impact on certain governments and a section of public opinion. However, today, this weapon of the "Cold War" is turning against those governments that attempt to use intimidation, because their own people have realized that they themselves may become victims of the destructive power of nuclear weapons.

    Joliot-Curie pointed out that the claim that large stockpiles of nuclear weapons can serve as a "guarantee of peace" is dangerous. He said that this stockpile itself is a ready-made threat.

    He said that measures should be taken immediately to avoid atomic war. Therefore, we must strive to take a decision in the shortest possible time to prohibit the testing and manufacture of all types of atomic bombs, and to transfer the fissile materials currently stored for the manufacture of bombs for peaceful purposes.

    The number of people who signed the Appeal to the People of the World issued by the Vienna Conference of the World Peace Council is enough to prove that these issues are widely understood and that everyone is eager to prevent serious dangers. Concluding an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the cessation of their manufacture would certainly ease international tension.

    Joliot-Curie pointed out that the issue of prohibiting weapons of mass destruction is linked to the issue of disarmament, and disarmament is precisely the concrete action demanded by public opinion.

    He mentioned the British and French plans and the Soviet Union's May 10th proposal. He said that now there is more hope than ever before to solve the two major problems of destroying weapons of mass destruction and disarmament.

    Speaking of disarmament, Joliot-Curie said that, as always, we should take into account the difficulties created by those who take advantage of the arms race to reap huge profits. Their activities are particularly dangerous because their approach is indirect and they rely on huge amounts of capital.

    He said that it should also not be concealed that once international agreements on atomic weapons and disarmament are implemented, there will be problems of economic stability and industrial reorganization, which will have great economic and social consequences. He continued, but these difficulties are by no means insurmountable, especially in a peaceful environment, in which countries with different systems will establish relations of peaceful coexistence, and the desire to satisfy people's most reasonable and pressing needs will replace the desire for military rule.

    The productive forces now used for armaments production can be used to help backward countries. Developing the means of production according to the characteristics of each country and respecting the independence of all nations can promote the development of economic exchanges between countries. Industrialized countries can play a major role in this endeavor.

    Joliot-Curie particularly pointed out that the United States can play a huge role in this matter. And he pointed out that in this country, more and more signs indicate that the desire to ease international tension and the desire for peace are also becoming stronger.

    Joliot-Curie said that it is undeniable that the international situation has now improved. All those who have promoted the improvement of the situation in various ways are encouraged by this and will therefore continue to work hard. However, there are still many outstanding difficult problems: the German peace treaty issue, the Korean issue, the Vietnamese issue, the Taiwan issue, the North African issue, the Middle East issue, and the South American issue... Economic and cultural relations are being disrupted or are subject to dangerous restrictions; many countries are organizing military blocs; some countries are establishing and occupying military bases far from their own borders; the expansion of armaments is still continuing; research on bacteriological weapons is underway; the stockpile of atomic weapons is constantly increasing... But all people increasingly strongly desire that all problems will be resolved peacefully. The Four-Power Summit to be held soon in Geneva is in line with this desire. This meeting raises great hopes, and the meeting will take into account the demands of public opinion. Therefore, the results of our work are very important.

    Joliot-Curie said, moreover, I believe that the Four-Power Summit will be able to a large extent to promote the restoration of the importance of the United Nations. The normal situation is that most problems can be resolved within the United Nations. If the United Nations follows its charter, if it has universal and genuine representation, especially if it can stop excluding the People's Republic of China, then this organization will be able to play the role it was originally intended to play. I believe that a five-power conference should be held after this Four-Power Summit.

    Joliot-Curie concluded, I feel it is appropriate to talk about certain aspects of the international situation in this way and to express certain views on solutions to issues of concern to people around the world. The conclusions we will draw should be able to attract a large number of people who are still indifferent or do not express their opinions to join the struggle for peace.

### 在赫尔辛基世界和平大会开幕会议上  约里奥—居里发表演说

    在赫尔辛基世界和平大会开幕会议上
    约里奥—居里发表演说
    据新华社讯　塔斯社赫尔辛基二十三日电：世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里二十二日在赫尔辛基世界和平大会开幕会议上发表了演说。
    他说，经过在各个国家中进行了许多年工作以后、在各种不同的因素的影响下，一种巨大的、非常巨大的力量产生着越来越大的影响：公众舆论。我们在这些日子里将看到许多不同国家的、大概对于最近若干年历史具有不同看法的人们彼此表明他们的愿望。而这种彼此表明愿望，一定会导向更好的了解，并且展开一种更为清楚的、更为有力的和更为坚决的努力，要在最近的将来——通过许多具体的行动——建立一种真正的和平气氛和国际紧张局势的缓和。
    任何人不能否认，今天世界各国人民的要求是阻止战争。这个要求应该得到满足……大致地说，在去年期间，国际形势曾经好转。各国政府所发表的声明、有影响的人士所发表的书面的或者口头的谈话以及世界各地报纸所刊载的越来越多的文章，一致符合各地人民的这个最亲切的愿望；这些便是缓和国际紧张局势的因素。
    约里奥—居里接着追述了像决定召开日内瓦会议的柏林四国会议等事件。
    日内瓦会议和马尼拉会议不同。马尼拉会议在结束时签订了一项要使世界分裂为敌对集团的军事条约。这个军事联盟打破了日内瓦会议所产生的许多希望，成为“实力地位”政策的一部分。
    稍后，在万隆举行了另一次引起全世界注意的会议。这个会议签订了重要的经济、文化和政治协定；这个会议所通过的十项原则是真正的和平共处的宪章。
    人们原可以希望选择类似的途径来设法和平解决德国问题，选择一条导向在联合国宪章范围内建立集体安全的途径。但是，伦敦协定和巴黎协定签订了，批准了，从而使德意志联邦共和国得以重新军国主义化，使它参加了北大西洋公约组织，使一个西方联盟得以建立。
    约里奥—居里继续说道：伦敦和巴黎协定反映了追求“实力地位”。这些协定加深了世界分裂为集团。
    约里奥—居里断然驳斥了这种论调：由于这样建立起来的“实力地位”，结果产生了一系列为缓和国际紧张局势提供机会的步骤和建议。他说，这是颠倒是非。巴黎协定实际上是缓和紧张局势的一个严重障碍。
    他指出，某些政府认为，用随意调节冷战强度的办法，它们就能得到一种避免财政危机的手段，它们认为，在世界公众面前证明这一给某些集团带来利润的武装政策的正当，是在它们的内政和外交政策方面使用有效压力的一种手段。
      当许多人都希望谈判将会使他们摆脱惊恐的时候，在我看来，确定“谈判”这个字具有什么意义是极为重要的。在我看来，为了事先一手决定国际谈判的结果而建立“实力地位”，这意味着执行一种最后通牒的政策，而不是谈判的政策。
      从不应该让阴谋、压力和威胁来加剧目前的紧张局势这种前提出发，我以为，谈判的目的应该在于通过相互的让步来寻求能为有关各方所接受的决定。
    约里奥—居里提醒代表们注意和奥地利缔结国家条约的谈判所获得的成就。他说，在其他国家里，广泛的公众各界都认为，有利于具有不同政治制度的国家间建立有效关系的这种独立，是和平的一个重要因素。
    他接着说，由于和平力量的有力的行动，许多曾经认为战争是不可避免的人们，现在都开始放弃这种想法了。
    世界舆论的消极情绪正在不断地为一种越来越持久因而也是越来越坚定的信念所代替：战争是能够抵抗的。约里奥—居里强调指出：这种信念正在不断地增长和扩大，因为第二次世界大战的可怕的后果在人们的脑海里记忆犹新，因为大规模毁灭性武器所具有的意义越来越明显。
    自从一九四五年开始，某些人一直在散布各式各样关于原子弹和氢弹可能造成的破坏的恐怖，以便行使实际上是真正的讹诈的政治压力，这种讹诈开始时对某些政府和一部分公众舆论是产生了一些影响的。但是，今天，这种“冷战”的武器正在反过来打击那些企图使用威吓手段的政府，因为它们本国人民已经认识到，他们自己也可能成为核子武器的毁灭性力量的牺牲品。
    约里奥—居里指出，所谓大量储存核子武器可以作为“和平的保证”的说法是危险的。他说，这种储存本身就是现成的威胁。
    他说，应该立即采取措施来避免原子战争。因此，我们必须努力争取在最短期内采取一个决定，禁止试验和制造一切类型的原子弹，把目前储存准备制造炸弹用的分裂性物质转用于和平用途。
    在世界和平理事会维也纳会议提出的告全世界人民书上签名的人数足以证明，这些问题已得到普遍的了解，证明大家急切希望防止严重的危险。缔结一项关于禁止原子武器和停止制造原子武器的协定，是一定会使国际紧张局势得到和缓的。
    约里奥—居里指出，禁止大规模毁灭性武器问题是同裁减军备问题联系在一起的，而裁减军备正是舆论所要求采取的具体行动。
    他提到了英法的计划和苏联五月十日的建议。他说，现在要解决销毁大规模毁灭性武器和裁减军备这两个重大问题，比以往任何时候都有希望。
    约里奥—居里在谈到裁军问题时说，和以往一样，我们应当考虑到那些趁军备竞赛的机会捞取巨额利润的人们所制造的困难。他们的活动是特别危险的，因为他们的做法是间接的，而且他们所倚仗的是巨额资财。
    他说，同样也不应该隐瞒，关于原子武器和裁减军备的国际协议一旦实施，就会发生经济稳定和工业改组的问题，这将会引起很大的经济和社会后果。他继续说，但是，这些困难决不是不能克服的，特别是在和平的环境下，在这种环境下，各种不同制度的国家将要建立和平共处的关系，满足人们最合理的和最切身的需要的愿望将代替武力统治的欲望。
    现在用于军备生产的生产力，就可以用来帮助落后国家。按照每一个国家的特点来发展生产资料，并且尊重各民族的独立，这就能促进各国经济交流的发展。工业国可以在这个事业中起很大的作用。
    约里奥—居里特别指出，美国在这件事情上能发生巨大作用。并且指出，在这个国家里，越来越多的迹象说明，要求缓和国际紧张局势和要求和平的愿望也越来越强了。
    约里奥—居里说，无可否认，现在国际局势已经有了改善。凡是曾经用各种方式促进局势改善的人，都由此得到鼓舞，会因此而继续努力。但是，现在还有许多悬而未决的困难问题：对德和约问题、朝鲜问题、越南问题、台湾问题、北非问题、中东问题和南美问题……经济和文化关系被破坏或是受到危险的限制；许多国家在组织军事集团；某些国家正在远离自己的国境的地方建立和占有军事基地；扩充军备仍在继续；细菌武器方面的研究工作正在进行；原子武器的储存不断增加……但是，所有的人都日益强烈地愿望，一切问题将通过和平方式获得解决。不久将在日内瓦举行的四国首脑会议是符合这一愿望的。这一会议引起很大的希望，而会议又将考虑到舆论的要求。因此，我们工作的结果是很重要的。
    约里奥—居里说，此外，我认为，四国首脑会议将能够在很大程度上促使联合国恢复它的重要性。正常的情况是，大多数问题能够在联合国内获得解决。如果联合国遵循它的宪章，如果它具有普遍的真正代表性，特别是如果它能够停止排斥中华人民共和国的作法，那末这个组织就能够起它原来所应起的作用。我认为，在这次四国首脑会议之后应当举行五大国会议。
    约里奥—居里最后说道，我觉得，这样地谈谈国际局势的某些方面，并对全世界人们所关怀的问题的解决办法表示某些看法，是适宜的。我们将得出的结论，应当能吸引很大一部分迄今仍然不关心或是不表示意见的人加入争取和平的斗争。
