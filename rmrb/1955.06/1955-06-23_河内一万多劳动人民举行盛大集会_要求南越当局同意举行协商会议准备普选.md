Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 20th. More than 10,000 laborers in Hanoi held a grand rally on the evening of the 19th, demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities, in accordance with the Geneva Accords, hold a consultative conference with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam starting from July 20th to prepare for general elections.

　　Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that Vietnam, from Muc Nam Quan to Cape Ca Mau, is a unified whole. Our history, culture, language, and bloodline are the same and cannot be divided by anyone. Hoang Quoc Viet continued, the American imperialists and their running dogs are dreaming of dividing our country's territory and dragging South Vietnam into aggressive military blocs. The Vietnamese people's struggle to consolidate peace and unify the motherland is still complex and arduous. However, because the entire people of Vietnam, from south to north, eagerly desire the unification of the motherland, and they form an invincible force under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the government; because of the provisions of the Geneva Accords and the demands of people of all countries for the implementation of the terms of the agreement; because of the complete liberation of the northern region; and also because of the growing contradictions between the United States and France, and between the pro-American and pro-French factions in South Vietnam, the Vietnamese people's struggle will surely be victorious. Hoang Quoc Viet finally called on the workers to unite closely with the entire people and carry out the struggle to win consultation, general elections, and the unification of the motherland.

　　Representatives of railway workers, postal and telecommunications workers, and porters from Hanoi City spoke at the meeting one after another, unanimously expressing their desire for consultation and general elections.

　　The conference passed resolutions and telegrams addressed to President Ho Chi Minh, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the workers and people of South Vietnam, and the workers of Paris. It concluded with enthusiastic slogans demanding unification.

    河内一万多劳动人民举行盛大集会
    要求南越当局同意举行协商会议准备普选
    新华社河内二十日电　河内市一万多劳动人民十九日晚举行盛大集会，要求南越当局按照日内瓦协议同越南民主共和国政府从七月二十日起举行协商会议准备普选。
    越南总工会主席黄国越在会上讲话。他指出，越南从睦南关到金瓯角是一个统一的整体。我们的历史、文化、语言、血统是同一的，是任何人都不能加以分割的。黄国越接着说，美帝国主义和它的走狗正梦想分割我国的领土，把南越拉入侵略性的军事集团。越南人民为巩固和平、统一祖国而进行的斗争还是复杂的、艰苦的。但是由于越南从南到北的全国人民都热望祖国的统一，他们在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和政府领导下形成一个无敌的力量；由于日内瓦协定的规定以及各国人民要求实现协定的条款；由于北部地区的完全解放；同时由于美法之间、南越亲美派同亲法派之间矛盾的增长，越南人民的斗争一定能胜利。黄国越最后号召工人同全体人民紧密团结，进行争取协商、普选和统一祖国的斗争。
    河内市的铁路工人、邮电工人、搬运工人代表先后在会上讲话，他们一致表达了要求协商和普选的愿望。
    大会通过了决议和致胡志明主席、越南劳动党中央、越南民主共和国政府、致南越工人和人民、致巴黎工人的电文，最后在要求统一的热烈口号声中闭幕。
