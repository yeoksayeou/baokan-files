Tangtu Township in Wuchang County, Hubei Province, has a total of 405 households. Last year, four out of the township’s thirteen electoral districts suffered from disasters; however, based on the overall situation of the township, the harvest was normal. After the autumn harvest last year, the state purchased more than 550,000 jin of grain from this township through unified purchase; at the same time, it assessed that 35 households with 103 people needed grain supply. Generally speaking, the "four retention" policy was better implemented during the unified purchase work, and the masses had no objections; the figures for grain needed by grain-deficient households for state supply were assessed once to last until the end of May of this year, which everyone considered to be basically reasonable.

However, from December of last year, the unified sales work in this township became increasingly tense, and many farmers who had just sold their surplus grain and retained enough rations suddenly became "grain-deficient households," constantly requesting grain supplies from township staff. The township's unified sales figures increased month by month from December. For example, in the twelfth electoral district, there were a total of 36 households, and only 13 households were short of grain in December. The number of grain-deficient households increased to 15 in January, 28 in February, and as many as 33 in April. The situation in other electoral districts was roughly similar. In the fourth electoral district, out of a total of 35 households, the number requesting supplies in April reached 100% of the total number of households. For the township as a whole, the supply coverage in April and May reached 90% of the total population of the township. The supply volume in April and May alone accounted for 94% of the 69,000 jin of grain allocated for April to June. This means that, if this continues, the state would have to supply another 30,000 jin of grain to this township in June to solve the problem.

Why is it that the unified grain purchase work in this township went relatively well last year, but the unified grain sales work this year is so chaotic?

The county party committee's rectification work group for unified grain sales discovered that the grain supply figures requested by grain-deficient farmers in this township had serious falsehoods. Taking the eighth electoral district of the township as an example, this electoral district has 50 households, and 44 households were "grain-deficient households" in April. After investigation, it was found that half of the households were either falsely reporting deficiencies or reporting small deficiencies as large deficiencies. Middle peasant Luo Huiyin only lacked 100 jin of rations in April, but he requested a supply of 180 jin; rich peasant Luo Huixin was a surplus grain household but also claimed to be short of 110 jin of rations. The grain supply quota for this electoral district for April and May was 5,400 jin. If the aforementioned false phenomena were eliminated, the entire electoral district would only need to supply 2,400 jin of grain in April and May. That is to say, the actual required figure is more than half less than the false figure. All thirteen electoral districts in the township had varying degrees of false phenomena.

After analyzing these situations, the work group and the Party branch believed that the reasons for the chaos in the township's unified grain sales work were as follows:

First of all, the masses of farmers had many concerns about the unified grain sales. Farmers in this township are accustomed to eating rice, and some poor peasants were afraid that the government would supply them with wheat and coarse grains, and that grinding wheat would be time-consuming and delay production, so they over-reported their grain deficiency figures. Poor peasant Xia Lanjun's family actually had six people, but she reported seven people. They actually only needed 150 jin of grain per month, but reported 200 jin. Some middle peasants with surplus grain, who were not short of grain or only slightly short, generally had the idea of fearing to reveal wealth and regarding grain deficiency as "glorious." They also requested supplies from the government, reporting non-deficiency as deficiency, and small deficiency as large deficiency. Middle peasant Pan Shirong only lacked 90 jin of grain in April, but he requested a supply of 140 jin.

Secondly, the staff of this township had many shortcomings in the unified sales work. Seeing that more and more people were requesting supplies, they did not conduct propaganda and explanation to the masses, but instead adopted a wrong approach. For example, the township finance and grain committee member, seeing that more and more people were requesting supplies, did not proceed from the actual situation, to see who was short of grain, who was not short of grain, and how much each was short, and try to achieve a reasonable supply, but instead adopted a method of evasion. He either said, "You go to the township head, I am not responsible," or he would issue supply certificates to whoever requested them most urgently. Township head Zhu Shoucai, seeing that the masses were requesting more supplies, also passively complained that the government's grain supply quota was too low. A few staff members also followed the masses in saying they were short of grain. For example, township government member Pan Dachao, seeing that the masses were requesting supplies, also claimed an extra 50 jin of grain coupons. Another township government member, Yu Shijiang, used "assessed supply" to give favors to people from January to April, and 15 farmers who should not have been supplied were assessed as "grain-deficient households" by him. Because the township staff adopted these wrong practices in the unified sales work, it further increased the chaos in the township's unified grain sales work.

Finally, a few rich peasants who had surplus grain at home also took the opportunity to request supplies, creating a tense atmosphere regarding grain, and sabotaging the unified sales work. The rich peasants Luo Huixin and Luo Huiguang in this township attempted to use the masses' blind requests for supplies and the shortcomings of the township staff to create a tense atmosphere regarding grain and sabotage the unified grain sales work.

After the work group and the Party branch identified these reasons, they successively convened cadre meetings, township people's representative meetings, and electoral district mass meetings to repeatedly publicize the policy of unified purchase and sales of grain, especially the policy of reasonable supply. Through recalling and comparing, they raised the awareness of the masses, and pointed out that there were false phenomena in the unified grain sales in this township. Township staff also reviewed their past mistakes and shortcomings in their work. After this layer-by-layer ideological mobilization, the entire township's rectification of unified grain sales work achieved remarkable results. At the mass meeting in the fourth electoral district, township government member Chen Shenming took the lead in reducing his falsely reported 48 jin of grain, and the masses also automatically reduced the grain supply figures they had requested from the state according to their actual needs. Middle peasant Ma Mingyuan originally requested that his family be supplied with 210 jin of grain in May. He said at the meeting: "In the past, I saw you all reporting more, so I reported more too. Now I know the policy of reasonable supply, and I will also reduce 100 jin." The result of the assessment in this electoral district was that it was reduced by 1,045 jin compared to the original supply quota for May. Poor peasant Tu Rongfu from the thirteenth electoral district was deeply moved when he learned that the government had transferred grain from other places, spending a lot of transportation costs, and still supplied it to the farmers at a low price of nine cents per jin. He said, "If we don't save grain, we will not only be letting down the state, but also ourselves." He automatically asked for 30 jin less of supply grain. Huang Fukui was a surplus grain household but still wanted supplies, and the masses exposed the fact that his family still had a lot of glutinous rice and buckwheat. In this way, he no longer requested supplies. The result of the assessment in the thirteen electoral districts of the township was that the state actually only needed to supply 56,200 jin of grain in April, May, and June, which was more than 12,000 jin less than the original supply quota of 69,000 jin of grain allocated to this township by the county people's committee.

After rectifying the unified grain sales work, the ideological level of the township staff and the production enthusiasm of the masses have both been significantly improved. Township head Zhu Shoucai said: "In the past, I didn't go deep into the work, and only saw the surface tension. Now I know that there were such serious false situations." Party branch secretary Huang Sifang said: "Doing this way, the masses have no objections, and our work is easier to do."

    唐凃乡粮食供应中的不合理现象纠正了
    王炳友
    湖北省武昌县唐凃乡共有四百零五户。去年全乡十三个选区中，有四个选区受灾；但按全乡情况说，收成正常。去年秋后，国家在这个乡统购了五十五万多斤粮食；同时也评定了三十五户一百零三人需要供应的缺粮户。在这次统购工作中，一般说四留政策贯彻得比较好，群众都没有意见；缺粮户需要国家供应的粮食数字，在当时就一次评到今年的五月底，大家也认为评议基本合理。
    可是，从去年十二月份起，这个乡的粮食统销工作，却一天一天紧张起来，许多刚刚卖完余粮、留足口粮的农民，忽然变成了“缺粮户”，他们不断向乡工作人员要求供应粮食。全乡统销数字，从十二月起，就逐月增加。例如第十二选区共有三十六户，十二月份只有十三户缺粮，一月份缺粮户增加到十五户，二月份又增加到二十八户，四月份竟增加到三十三户。其他选区的情况也大体如此，第四选区共三十五户，四月份要求供应的竟达总户数的百分之百。从全乡来说，四、五两月的供应面已达全乡总人数的百分之九十，仅四、五两个月份的供应数，就占去了四至六月份指标数六万九千多斤粮食的百分之九十四。这就是说，照这样下去，六月份还得国家再供应这个乡三万多斤粮食，才能解决问题。
    为什么这个去年粮食统购工作做得较好的乡，今年粮食统销工作却是这样混乱呢？
    县委整顿粮食统销工作组发现这个乡缺粮农民要求的粮食供应数字有严重的虚假现象。以这个乡的第八选区为例，这个选区共有五十户人家，四月份有四十四户是“缺粮户”，经过调查，有一半户数是不缺报缺或以少缺报多缺。中农罗辉银四月份只差一百斤口粮，但他却要求供应一百八十斤；富农罗辉馨是余粮户，也说缺一百一十斤口粮。这个选区四、五两月的粮食供应指标是五千四百斤，如果消除上面说的那种虚假现象，全选区四、五两月只要供应二千四百斤粮食就够了，也就是说，实际需要的数字比虚假数字少一半还多。全乡十三个选区，都有不同程度的虚假现象。
    工作组和党支部对这些情况作了分析，认为造成这个乡粮食统销工作混乱的原因有以下几个：
    首先是农民群众对粮食统销有不少顾虑。这个乡的农民习惯吃大米，有些贫农怕政府给他们供应麦子和杂粮，怕磨麦子费功夫，耽误生产，因此他们就多报缺粮数字。贫农夏兰君家里实有六口人，却报了七口人，实际一个月只需要一百五十斤粮食，却报了二百斤。有些有余粮、不缺粮或缺粮很少的中农普遍有怕露富和以缺粮为“光荣”的思想。他们也向政府要求供应，以不缺报缺，以少缺报多缺。中农潘士荣四月份只缺九十斤粮食，却要求供应一百四十斤。
    其次是这个乡的工作人员在统销工作中有不少缺点。他们看到群众对粮食统销有顾虑，也不向群众进行宣传解释，而是采取了一种错误的做法。如乡财粮委员看到要求供应的人越来越多，不是从实际情况出发，看谁缺粮，谁不缺粮，谁缺多少，设法做到合理供应，而是采取推托敷衍的办法。他不是说
  “你们找乡长，我不负责”，便是看谁要得紧，就给谁发供应证。乡长朱守才看到群众要求多供应，也消极埋怨政府的粮食供应指标低了。还有少数工作人员跟着群众说缺粮。如乡政府委员潘大超看见群众要求供应，他也多领了五十斤粮票。另一乡政府委员余士江在一月到四月四个月内，竟用“评议供应”来送人情，有十五户不该供应的农民，都被他评成了“缺粮户”。由于乡工作人员在统销工作中采取这些错误的做法，也就更增加了这个乡粮食统销工作的混乱。
    最后，有少数家中本有余粮的富农，也乘机要求供应，制造粮食紧张空气，破坏统销工作。这个乡的富农罗辉馨、罗辉广就企图利用群众盲目要求供应和乡工作人员的缺点，来制造粮食紧张空气，破坏粮食统销工作。
    工作组和党支部找出了这些原因以后，就连续召开了干部会、乡人民代表会、选区群众会，反复宣传粮食的统购统销特别是合理供应的政策。通过回忆对比，提高群众的觉悟，并指出这个乡在粮食统销中有虚假现象。乡工作人员也检讨了过去工作上的错误和缺点。经过这样层层思想发动后，全乡整顿粮食统销工作就取得了显著成绩。在第四选区的群众会上，乡政府委员陈申明带头减去自己虚报的四十八斤粮食后，群众也根据实际需要自动减少了自己要求国家供应的粮食数字。中农马明元原来要求五月份供应他家二百一十斤粮食。他在这次会上说：“过去我看你们多报，我也多报，现在我知道了合理供应的政策，我也减去一百斤。”这个选区评议的结果，比五月份原来的供应指标减少了一千零四十五斤。十三选区贫农凃荣甫了解到政府从外地调进粮食，花了很多运费，还是以九分钱一斤的低价，足量供应给农民的事实，很受感动，他说：“我们再不节约粮食，不但对不起国家，也对不起自己。”他自动少要了三十斤供应粮。黄复奎是余粮户，仍然要供应，群众就揭露他家还有很多糯米和荞麦的事实，这样，他就不再要求供应了。全乡十三个选区评议的结果，在四、五、六三个月内实际只需要国家供应五万六千二百多斤粮食就够了；比县人民委员会原来分配给这个乡的供应指标六万九千多斤粮食，要减少一万二千多斤。
    经过整顿粮食统销工作以后，乡工作人员的思想水平和群众的生产积极性都显著地提高了。乡长朱守才说：“过去工作不深入，光看表面紧张，现在才知道还有这么严重的虚假情况。”支部书记黄四方说：“这样做群众都没有意见，我们工作也好做了。”
