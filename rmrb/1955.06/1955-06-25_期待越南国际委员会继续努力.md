　　The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam recently submitted its third interim report. The report shows that during the period covered by the report (February 11 to April 10, 1955), although the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam encountered many difficulties, progress was still made. Both sides basically implemented the regroupment and transfer of troops in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. The efforts made by the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam in this regard are commendable.
　　At present, the issue of greatest concern to the people of Vietnam and the world is the realization of the unification of Vietnam through general elections. According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the general election for the whole of Vietnam should be held under the supervision of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam in July 1956, and on July 20 this year, the responsible authorities of both sides in Vietnam should begin consultations on the issue of the general election. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on June 6, announcing its readiness to hold a consultation meeting with the representative responsible authorities of South Vietnam as scheduled to discuss the preparations for the aforementioned general election for the whole of Vietnam. At the same time, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly proposed the rapid restoration of normal relations between North and South Vietnam in all aspects in order to provide favorable conditions for the unification of Vietnam. However, the United States is openly attempting to sabotage the general election for the whole of Vietnam, and various clamors aimed at sabotaging this election are constantly emanating from the United States and South Vietnam.
　　One of the excuses used by the United States to sabotage the general election for the whole of Vietnam is the so-called South Vietnam is not bound by the Geneva Accords. In its previous reports, the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam has denounced the view that South Vietnam can be exempt from the Geneva Accords and demanded that both parties and the commission cooperate to strictly implement all the provisions of the Geneva Accords. This is entirely correct. In fact, not only are both sides in Vietnam obliged to implement the Geneva Accords, but all the participating countries of the Geneva Conference, including the United States, are responsible for ensuring the effective implementation of the Geneva Accords.
　　The United States and South Vietnam are also spreading the fallacy that the general election for the whole of Vietnam should be supervised by the United Nations. Everyone knows that this is a proposal that the United States made at the Geneva Conference but was rejected by the Geneva Conference. The Geneva Accords have expressly stipulated that the general election for the whole of Vietnam should be supervised by the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam. The purpose of the United States in reintroducing this proposal in violation of the Geneva Accords is obviously to sabotage the general election for the whole of Vietnam.
　　In addition, the propaganda organs of the United States have repeatedly slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for obstructing the migration of civilians to the South,妄想以此作为 it dreams of using this as another excuse for it to sabotage the general election for the whole of Vietnam. It should be pointed out that due to long-term war damage and lack of transportation, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will naturally encounter certain difficulties in providing transportation for civilians who voluntarily migrate to the South. This is perfectly understandable. The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam also mentioned this issue in its third interim report. However, despite this, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has still made great efforts to assist civilians who voluntarily migrate to South Vietnam. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has widely announced the contents of the relevant provisions of the Geneva Accords in the areas under its control and has generally established institutions responsible for implementing these provisions. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has also tried to solve the transportation problem for civilians who voluntarily migrate to the South by renting ships from other countries and other methods. It should be emphasized that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam took the initiative to propose to the other side as early as February 4, 1955, to allow the Vietnamese people to move freely between North and South Vietnam. Since the other side has not yet responded to this proposal, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has agreed to continue to apply its measures to facilitate the migration of residents for two months after the expiration of the 300-day period stipulated in the Geneva Accords. These facts have completely shattered the slander that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is obstructing the migration of civilians to the South and eloquently prove that it is precisely the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that truly cares about the full freedom of migration of the Vietnamese people.
　　In fact, it is the South Vietnamese side that is violating the regulations on civilian migration and undermining the democratic freedom of the Vietnamese people. In its third interim report, the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam once again pointed out the fact that the South Vietnamese authorities are illegally persecuting former resistance personnel and the South Vietnamese people, and illegally detaining civilians detained by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is precisely because such incidents of infringing on the democratic freedom of the people continue to occur in South Vietnam that it is even more necessary for the two sides of Vietnam to begin consultations as scheduled on July 20 this year to formulate various methods to ensure that elections are held throughout Vietnam with full respect for democratic freedom.
　　The reason why the United States wants to sabotage the elections in the whole of Vietnam is to obstruct the democratic unification of Vietnam, so that the United States can continue to control South Vietnam and enslave the South Vietnamese people, and turn South Vietnam into a base for the United States to promote its aggression and war plans in Indochina and Asia. Therefore, while the United States is trying to prevent the national elections in Vietnam from being held as scheduled, it is also stepping up the so-called "military assistance" to South Vietnam, training the South Vietnamese army, and trying to establish an armed force in South Vietnam that is controlled by the United States and completely loyal to the United States. This approach of the United States seriously violates the provisions of the Geneva Accords on prohibiting the provision of reinforcements to Vietnam, prohibiting the establishment of military bases in the three Indochina countries and dragging the three Indochina countries into military alliances, as well as the provisions on respecting the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Indochina countries and not interfering in their internal affairs. This approach of the United States has created chaos in South Vietnam and caused huge losses to the lives and property of the South Vietnamese people. As early as December 5, 1954, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent letters to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam, pointing out the serious consequences that the United States' equipping and training of the South Vietnamese army and intensifying its interference in South Vietnam's internal affairs after the armistice would inevitably cause. The United States' open conspiracy to undermine the peaceful reunification of Vietnam cannot but cause all countries and peoples who are concerned about the unification of Vietnam and the peace of Indochina to pay more serious attention to this issue.
　　The implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam is not only directly related to the peace, independence, democracy and unification of Vietnam, but also closely related to the peace and security of the entire Indochina and the Far East. The thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords requires not only the continued efforts of the Vietnamese people, but also the joint efforts of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference and peace-loving countries and peoples all over the world. The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam is responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. The people also earnestly expect the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam to make greater contributions to the realization of the democratic unification of Vietnam and the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords.

### 期待越南国际委员会继续努力

    期待越南国际委员会继续努力
    越南国际委员会最近提出了第三次工作报告。报告表明：在报告所叙述的那一段时期内（一九五五年二月十一日至四月十日），日内瓦协议在越南的实施虽然遭遇到不少困难，但还是取得了进展。双方基本上按照协议的规定执行了部队的集结和转移。越南国际委员会在这一方面所作的努力，是值得称道的。
    目前，越南和世界人民所极为关心的问题，是全越南通过普选实现统一的问题。根据日内瓦协议的规定，全越南普选应该在一九五六年七月内在越南国际委员会的监督下举行，而在今年七月二十日，越南双方负责当局就应该开始就普选问题进行协商。越南民主共和国政府已经在六月六日发表声明，宣布它准备如期同南越有代表性的负责当局举行协商会议，讨论上述的全越南普选的筹备问题。同时，越南民主共和国政府已经一再建议迅速恢复北越和南越在各方面的正常关系，以便为越南的统一提供有利的条件。但是，美国却公开企图破坏全越南的普选，从美国和南越正不断发出各种旨在破坏这一选举的叫嚣。
    美国企图用作破坏全越南普选的一个借口，是所谓南越并不受日内瓦协议的约束。越南国际委员会在几次的工作报告中已经斥责了所谓南越可以不受日内瓦协议约束的观点，并要求双方和该委员会合作，严格贯彻日内瓦协议的一切规定。这是完全正确的。事实上，不仅越南双方负有贯彻日内瓦协议的义务，而且日内瓦会议的所有参加国，包括美国在内，都负有保证日内瓦协议的切实实施的责任。
    美国和南越方面还在散布所谓全越南普选应由联合国监督的谬论。谁都知道，这是美国在日内瓦会议上曾经提出但为日内瓦会议所拒绝了的主张。日内瓦协议已经明文规定全越南选举应该由越南国际委员会来监督。美国现在重新提出这种违反日内瓦协议的主张，它的目的显然是要破坏全越南的选举。
    此外，美国的宣传机构还曾一再诬蔑越南民主共和国阻挠平民南迁，妄想以此作为它破坏全越南普选的另一个借口。应该指出：由于长期的战争破坏和缺乏交通工具等因素，越南民主共和国在为自愿南迁的平民提供交通便利中，很自然地会遭到一定的困难。这是完全可以理解的。越南国际委员会在第三次工作报告中也提到了这一问题。但是尽管如此，越南民主共和国仍旧尽了极大的努力来协助自愿迁居的平民迁移到南越去。越南民主共和国曾在它控制的地区内广泛地宣布了日内瓦协议有关规定的内容，并普遍地成立了负责执行这些规定的机构。越南民主共和国并且以租用其他国家船只等办法设法解决自愿南迁的平民的交通问题。特别应该着重指出的是：越南民主共和国早在一九五五年二月四日就主动地向对方提出允许越南人民自由往来于北越和南越之间的建议。而由于对方至今还没有对这一建议作出答复，越南民主共和国又同意将它便利居民迁居的措施，在日内瓦协议所规定的三百天期限满期后，继续适用两个月。这些事实彻底粉碎了所谓越南民主共和国阻挠平民南迁的谰言，雄辩地证明了：真正关心越南人民充分的迁居自由的，正是越南民主共和国。
    事实上，违反有关平民迁居的规定，破坏越南人民民主自由的，正是南越方面。越南国际委员会在第三次工作报告中再一次指出了南越当局非法迫害前抗战人员和南越人民，非法扣留越南民主共和国被拘平民的事实。正因为这种侵犯人民民主自由的事件还不断在南越发生，因此，由越南双方如期在今年七月二十日开始协商，制定出保证全越南在充分尊重民主自由的情况下举行选举的各项办法，就更加有其必要。
    美国所以要破坏全越南的选举，就是为了要阻挠越南的民主统一，以便美国能够继续控制南越和奴役南越人民，并把南越变成美国在印度支那和亚洲推行其侵略和战争计划的一个基地。因此，美国一面力图使越南的全国选举不能如期举行，另一面则加紧给予南越以所谓“军事援助”，训练南越军队，想在南越建立起一支由美国所控制并完全效忠于美国的武装力量。美国的这种做法严重违反了日内瓦协议关于禁止给予越南以增援性的军事援助、禁止在印度支那三国建立军事基地并把印度支那三国拉入军事同盟的规定，以及关于尊重印度支那国家的主权、独立和领土完整，并且不干涉其内政的规定。美国这种做法已经造成了南越的混乱局面，使南越人民的生命财产遭受到巨大的损失。早在一九五四年十二月五日，越南民主共和国方面即已分别致函日内瓦会议两主席和越南国际委员会，指出美国在停战后装备和训练南越军队和加紧干涉南越内政所必然引起的严重后果。美国公开破坏越南和平统一的阴谋不能不使一切关心越南的统一和印度支那和平的国家和人民对这一问题给予更严重的注意。
    日内瓦协议在越南的实施不仅直接关系着越南的和平、独立、民主和统一，而且密切关系着整个印度支那和远东的和平和安全。日内瓦协议的彻底实施不仅要求越南人民的继续努力，同时也要求日内瓦会议各参加国和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力。越南国际委员会负有监察和监督日内瓦协议各项规定在越南实施的责任。人民也殷切地期待越南国际委员会将为实现越南的民主统一，为彻底实施日内瓦协议，作出更大的贡献。
