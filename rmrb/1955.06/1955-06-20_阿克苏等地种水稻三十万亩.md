In Xinjiang Province's major rice-producing areas—Aksu Prefecture in southern Xinjiang and Miquan County in northern Xinjiang—more than 300,000 mu of rice will be planted this year. Currently, the rice planting work in Miquan County has been completed, and rice planting in Aksu Prefecture is underway. This year, farmers of all ethnic groups have further improved their cultivation techniques, generally increasing the application of base fertilizer. Many agricultural cooperatives have re-winnowed and mud-water selected seeds that were field-selected in 1954, and have also experimented with dry direct seeding.

The rice produced in the above-mentioned areas, especially Wensu, Aksu, and U什 in Miquan County and the Aksu River basin, has the advantages of large grains, good taste, and high yield. Most of the rice consumed in Urumqi, Yanqi, and other places is supplied by these areas. After the Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway opens to traffic, some of the rice here can also be transported to the Qaidam Basin.

    阿克苏等地种水稻三十万亩
      新疆省水稻主要产区——南疆阿克苏专区和北疆米泉县，今年将播种三十万余亩水稻。现在，米泉县的水稻播种工作已经结束，阿克苏专区的水稻播种正在进行。今年各族农民进一步改进了耕作技术，普遍增施了底肥，许多农业合作社把一九五四年经过田间穗选的种子又进行了风选和泥水选，并且试行了旱直播。
      上述地区特别是米泉县和阿克苏河流域的温宿、阿克苏、乌什等地所产的稻米，具有颗粒大、味道好、产量高等优点。乌鲁木齐、焉耆等地的食米大部分依靠这些地区供给。青新公路通车后，这里的一部分大米还可运到柴达木盆地。
