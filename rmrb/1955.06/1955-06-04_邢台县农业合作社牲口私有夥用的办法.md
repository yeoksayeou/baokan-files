    Xingtai County Agricultural Cooperative's Method of Private Ownership and Collective Use of Livestock
    Zhang Yumei, Secretary of the Xingtai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    In the early stages of establishing agricultural production cooperatives in Xingtai County, the county committee did not deeply understand the principle of "active leadership, steady progress," and prematurely and excessively advocated expanding the public property of agricultural cooperatives. In early 1953, out of the county's 116 cooperatives, 71 had converted all of the members' livestock into cooperative ownership and collective use after valuation. At that time, these cooperatives were economically weak and lacked experience in collective raising, and the socialist consciousness of the members was not high; therefore, problems occurred continuously. In the plains area, livestock did not have the habit of herding together, and after the livestock were put in the same trough, there were often cases of donkeys kicking, horses biting, and cattle butting heads. An even more common problem was the lack of grass and feed after the livestock were concentrated, resulting in poor feeding. Most of the livestock became thin, developed ringworm, shed skin, and lost hair, and some cooperative workers had to be busy all day long assigning grass and gathering feed. Some cooperatives could not gather enough feed and sold some livestock to buy feed to keep others alive. Poor and middle peasants had many opinions about this situation. Middle peasants complained that the valuation of the livestock was unfair and the repayment period was too long. They reflected: "After accumulating for many years to buy a livestock, it's like kicking it away when joining the cooperative!" Poor peasants complained that they were too heavily in debt. They said: "We just finished paying off our debts after the land reform, and now we're in debt again after joining the cooperative."
    In the spring of 1953, the higher-level party committee proposed correcting the tendency of blind and rash advancement; the county committee conscientiously implemented the policy of voluntary mutual benefit and properly handled the livestock issue. After rectification of each cooperative, the livestock of 56 cooperatives were returned to their original owners and changed to private ownership and collective use; the other 15 cooperatives had the conditions to collectively feed some livestock, and with the consent of all members, adopted a "leave what should be left, return what should be returned" contraction method. After doing this, the cooperative's expenses were reduced, and the members' emotions were stabilized.
    Currently, out of the county's 813 cooperatives, only a portion of the livestock in 18 old cooperatives with a relatively good foundation are cooperatively owned, cooperatively fed, and cooperatively used; another 148 cooperatives have adopted the method of private ownership, private feeding, and long-term rental, and 647 cooperatives have adopted the method of private ownership, private feeding, and temporary rental.
    The method of partially converting livestock into cooperative ownership, cooperative feeding, and cooperative use, and partially retaining private ownership is adopted by a small number of old cooperatives with a relatively good foundation, a certain economic strength, collective feeding conditions, and a high level of member consciousness. The number of livestock converted into cooperative ownership is determined after calculation based on the amount of land in the entire cooperative, the needs of agricultural and sideline production, and the possibility of economic conditions. For example, the Dongchuankou Agricultural Production Cooperative had a total of 64 livestock. In 1953, the cooperative only kept 14, and the others remained privately owned; the cooperative gradually added publicly owned livestock based on the improvement of economic conditions and the increase in member consciousness, and has now increased to 19. During the busy agricultural seasons, when the cooperative did not have enough livestock, it temporarily rented privately owned livestock from members with reasonable compensation. The rental is done in a "package" manner. For example, in the spring, it is stipulated that two livestock plow 2.5 mu of land per day, and each livestock is paid 7 jin of corn per day; in the summer, each livestock plows 3 mu of land per day, and each is paid 10 jin of corn. Generally, the accounts are recorded, and after the autumn harvest, the corn is converted into cash, and the cooperative pays the livestock owners for feed or grain at the price.
    Some cooperatives adopt the method of private livestock ownership, collective feeding and rental during busy seasons. For example, the Yin Jiaxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative is all dry land and requires less livestock; at the same time, the masses have a habit of engaging in transportation. In order to take care of the common interests of the cooperative and its members, the cooperative stipulates that collective feeding and rental will be carried out from March to October in the lunar calendar. During this period, the cooperative is fully responsible for the grass and feed; on the premise of not affecting agricultural production, the cooperative organizes labor and animal power to participate in transportation in a unified manner. By doing this, two people can drive five or six livestock, with low expenses and high profits; the income, in addition to purchasing grass and feed, is used to repay the rental price, and the shortfall is paid from the cooperative's total income. During the slack season, the livestock are still privately fed and used by each household, and the cooperative can temporarily rent them when needed. Because this is the peak month for transportation, members operate their own transportation, and all income goes to each individual, which they are very satisfied with.
    There are four specific methods for private ownership, private feeding, and rental by the cooperative: 1. Long-term rental in summer and autumn, and temporary rental in spring and winter. For example, the Qianluzi Agricultural Production Cooperative has a lot of paddy fields, and a lot of animal power is also needed to pull waterwheels to irrigate the land. It is stipulated that livestock will be divided into upper, middle, and lower grades in summer and autumn, and a reasonable price will be assessed based on the quality of the livestock and the lightness or heaviness of the agricultural work. Temporary rental is adopted in spring and winter, and the price is paid according to the amount of work done. 2. Year-round rental. The method is to democratically assess and stipulate the annual rental standard for each livestock based on the amount of work that needs to be done by livestock throughout the year, the amount of livestock consumption (grass, etc., excluding the value of manure), and the quality of the livestock. When using livestock, work points are calculated, and those who work more get more wages. 3. Private ownership, private feeding, and package use of livestock. The cooperative first calculates the amount of agricultural work that needs to be done by livestock throughout the year, and then, based on the specific situation of each household's livestock, separately assesses the number of workdays that each household's livestock will be used for in the cooperative and fixes it. It is stipulated that good livestock must do at least 75 workdays throughout the year, general livestock must do at least 50 workdays, and inferior livestock must do at least 30 workdays. Livestock owners know that it is profitable after calculating the accounts. For example, raising a large livestock can accumulate 300 dan of fertilizer throughout the year and get 300 jin of rice, and the livestock rental is 750 jin of rice, which can be converted into a total income of 115 yuan; in addition to livestock consumption, a net profit of about 50 yuan can be obtained per year. Raising a small livestock can get 83 yuan for the whole year for fertilizer accumulation and livestock rental; after deducting consumption, there is still a surplus of more than 20 yuan. The adoption of this method not only provides a certain income for livestock owners, but also facilitates their own use of livestock, effectively dispelling the ideological concerns of farmers who are unwilling to feed livestock themselves after joining the cooperative. 4. Temporary rental. This method is more commonly used in areas with less land, more livestock, and less time required for animal power. For example, the Shicao Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the mountainous area has an average of only 0.8 mu of land per person, and the plots are also very small, most of which cannot be plowed, and livestock are mainly raised for breeding as a part of diversified operations. Therefore, the cooperative stipulates that livestock will be temporarily rented during the busy farming season, and the price is calculated by the piece.
    When adopting the method of private ownership and rental, attention must be paid to resolving the contradiction between the members' own use and the cooperative's use, and solving the problems of not cherishing cooperatively used livestock and the lack of feed for households with livestock. In order to solve these problems, the Gutuo Agricultural Production Cooperative signed a use contract with the members who owned livestock. The contract stipulates: 1. In the use of livestock, the cooperative comes first, and the individual comes second, ensuring that the cooperative's use is not delayed; 2. Livestock owners guarantee that the livestock are fed adequately, and the cooperative must notify them the day before using the livestock; 3. When the cooperative uses livestock, they must go to the land on time and get off work on time, ensuring that the livestock are not used badly; 4. The cooperative is responsible for compensation if the livestock is disabled, injured, or dies due to public use. In order to solve the problem of the lack of feed for livestock owners, the general cooperatives adopted the following three methods: The first method is to give consideration when distributing grain and grass. For example, the Dongchuankou, Jinchayuan, and other cooperatives distributed fodder to households with livestock, firewood to households without livestock, and tried their best to distribute beans, sorghum, etc., which can be used as feed, to households with livestock. The second method is to organize mutual adjustments between members within the cooperative. For example, six households, including Zhao Shuncheng, members of the Beidaguocun Cooperative, requested to sell their livestock due to lack of grass. The cooperative mobilized Zhao Xian and other members without livestock to sell grain stalks to Zhao Shuncheng and other households with livestock; those who could not afford to pay at the time were allowed to engage in transportation to earn money and repay. The third method is to allow livestock owners to retain some pastureland. The Yin Guo Agricultural Production Cooperative stipulates that one mu or half a mu of pastureland can be retained according to the size of the livestock.
    After adopting the above methods, livestock owners were very satisfied. They reflected: "It's safer to do it this way than to farm and feed livestock ourselves!" After signing the contract, not only did no one sell livestock in the Zhang Wantai Agricultural Production Cooperative of Dashitou Village, but also four members bought two more cattle.
    Based on the actual experience of the past few years, the method of private livestock ownership and collective use has the following advantages:
    1. The cooperative's expenses are less, and the members' income is more. In 1952, the Dongchuankou Agricultural Production Cooperative had all livestock owned by the cooperative, and the annual expenditure was 4,000 yuan; in 1953, after most of the livestock were changed to private ownership, the total livestock expenditure for the year was only 1,300 yuan. After the Nanwangduan Agricultural Production Cooperative changed the livestock to private ownership, the savings in livestock expenses alone allowed each household to earn an extra 100 jin of grain.
    2. Saving feed, careful feeding, and livestock do not lose weight. When the livestock of the Hujialou Agricultural Production Cooperative were collectively owned and fed, one mule ate two shi of feed a year; after being converted to private ownership and private feeding, only four or five dou of feed were enough. (Because livestock owners can use the grain dregs left over from grinding flour and some leftover food as feed.) Each household also takes special care of their own livestock and feeds them very carefully.
    3. The cooperative's backbone personnel have reduced a lot of trouble and burden in management and operation.
    4. It is convenient for members to use, and it is profitable, which can improve the enthusiasm for purchasing, feeding, and breeding livestock. Wang Wanzao, a farmer in Dushu Village, had a breeding donkey. After the livestock were owned by the cooperative, no one brought livestock to mate; after being changed to private ownership, his breeding donkey could mate with seven or eight livestock per fair.

    邢台县农业合作社牲口私有夥用的办法
    中共邢台县委书记　张玉美
    河北省邢台县在建立农业生产合作社的初期，县委对“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针理解得不深刻，过早地、过多地盲目提倡扩大农业合作社的公共财产。一九五三年初，全县一百一十六个社，曾有七十一个社把社员的牲口全部折价归社夥有夥用。当时这些社经济力量还很薄弱，又缺乏集体饲养的经验，社员的社会主义觉悟程度也还不高；因此，曾经连续不断地发生问题。平原地区的牲口没有合群放牧的习惯，牲口合槽以后，常常是驴蹦、马咬、牛牴头。更加普遍的问题是牲口集中后缺草短料，饲养不善，大部牲口喂得削瘦、生癣、脱皮落毛，有些社的工作人员还得整天忙着派草凑料。有的社凑不起来草料，就卖了一些牲口买草料养活另一些牲口。贫农中农对这种情形都意见纷纷。中农嫌牲口评价不公、价款归还年限太长，他们反映：积累了多年，买下个牲口，入了社算一脚蹬了！贫农嫌负债太重，他们说：土地改革后才还完账，入了社又闹了一屁股账。
    一九五三年春，上级党委提出纠正盲目冒进偏向；县委认真贯彻了自愿互利政策，妥善地处理了牲口问题。经过逐社整顿，把五十六个社的牲口又退归牲口原主，改为私有夥用；另十五个社有条件夥喂一部分牲口，经全体社员同意，采取了“宜留者留、宜退者退”的收缩办法。这样做了以后，社的开支减少了，社员的情绪稳定了。
      现在，全县的八百一十三个社中，只有十八个基础较好的老社的一部分牲口是夥有夥喂夥用的；另外一百四十八个社采取私有私喂长期租用的办法，六百四十七个社采取私有私喂临时租用的办法。
    部分牲口折价归社夥有夥喂夥用、部分牲口仍归私有的办法，是少数基础较好、有一定经济力量和集体喂养条件，社员觉悟程度较高的老社采用的。折价归社的牲口数目，根据全社的土地多少、农业副业生产的需要和经济条件的可能，经过计算以后确定。如东川口农业生产合作社共有六十四头牲口，一九五三年社内只留了十四头，其他仍归私有；社内根据经济条件的好转和社员觉悟程度的提高，逐步增添公有牲口，至今已增加到十九头。在各个农忙紧张季节，社内牲口不够使用时，就以合理报酬，临时租用社员私有的牲口。租用是采取“包”的方式。如在春季规定两个牲口一天耕二亩半地，每头牲口每天付玉米七斤；夏季每头牲口每天耕地三亩，各付玉米十斤。一般是记下账来，到秋收以后把玉米折价，由社按价给牲口草料或粮食。
    有些社采取牲口私有、忙时夥喂租用的办法。如尹贾乡农业生产合作社，全是旱地，需用牲口较少；同时，群众有从事运输的习惯。为了照顾社和社员的共同利益，社内规定从夏历三月到十月由社夥喂租用。在这期间，草料完全由社负责；在不影响农业生产的前提下，社内统一组织劳动力和畜力参加运输。这样做，两个人可以赶五、六头牲口，开支小，得利大；所得的款，除购买草料外，用以归还租价，不足部分在社的总收入中开支。农闲季节，牲口仍归各户私喂私用，社需要时可临时租用。因为这时正当运输旺月，社员自己经营运输，收入全归各人自得，他们很满意。
    私有私喂、由社租用，有四种具体办法：一、夏秋长期租用，春冬临时租用。如前炉子农业生产合作社，水地多，拉水车浇地又需用畜力多，规定在夏秋两季把牲口分为上、中、下三等，根据牲口的好坏、农活的轻重，评出合理代价。春冬两季采取临时租用办法，按做活多少付给代价。二、常年租用。办法是根据全社全年需要用牲口做的工作的数量、牲口的消耗数量（草料等，除去粪肥折价）和牲口的好坏，民主评议规定每个牲口常年的租价标准。使用牲口时，按分计工，出工多的得工资多。三、私有私喂，按畜包用。社内先把全年需用牲口的农活计算好，然后再按各户牲口的具体情况，分别评议社内用各户牲口的工数，固定下来。规定用好牲口全年内至少做七十五个工，用一般牲口至少做五十个工，用次牲口至少做三十个工。有牲口户经过算账，知道是有利可图的。如养一个大牲口全年可积肥三百担，可得三百斤米，牲口租米七百五十斤，折成款共计可收入一百一十五元；除牲口消耗外，一年还可净得五十元左右。养一个小牲口，一年积肥连同畜租全年可得八十三元；除消耗以外，还剩余二十多元。采用这个办法，不仅使畜主有一定收入，又便于他们自己使用牲口，有效地解除了农民入社后不愿自喂牲口的思想顾虑。四、临时租用。这种办法在土地少、牲口多，需用畜力时间较少的地区采用的较多。如山区的石槽村农业生产合作社，每人平均只有八分地，地块也很小，大都不能用犁耕，喂养牲口主要是为了繁殖，作为多种经营的一种内容。因此，这个社规定在农忙时临时租用牲口，按件计算代价。
    采取私有租用的办法时，必须注意解决社员自用同社内使用之间的矛盾，解决对夥用牲口不爱惜和有牲口户缺乏草料等问题。为了解决这些问题，古驼农业生产合作社同有牲口的社员订了使用合同。合同规定：一、在牲口的使用上先社后己，保证不误社内使用；二、养牲口户保证把牲口喂饱饮足，社内用牲口必须在前一晌通知；三、社内用牲口时按时上地按时下工，保证不把牲口使坏；四、因公以致牲口残伤病死的，社内负责赔偿。为了解决有牲口户缺草料的问题，一般的社采用了以下三种办法：第一种办法是在分配粮草时给以照顾。如东川口、金察院等社，把饲草分给有牲口户，把柴禾分给没牲口户，把能做饲料的豆子、高粱等也尽量分给有牲口户。第二种办法是在社内组织社员之间互相调剂。如北大郭村社员赵顺成等六户因缺草要求卖掉牲口，社内动员没有牲口的社员赵宪等，把谷草卖给了赵顺成等有牲口户；当时给不起钱的，允许他们搞运输赚了钱归还。第三种办法是允许有牲口户留一些牧草地。尹郭农业生产合作社规定按牲口大小，可自留牧草地一亩或半亩。
    采取了以上一些办法后，有牲口户都很满意，他们反映：“要像这样办，比咱自己种地喂牲口还保险哩！”大石头庄张万太农业生产合作社经过订立合同以后，不但没人卖牲口了，并且有四户社员又买了两头牛。
    根据几年来的实际经验，实行牲口私有夥用的办法有以下几个好处：
    一、社内开支少，社员收入多。东川口农业生产合作社一九五二年牲口全部归社，一年开支四千元；一九五三年牲口大部改为私有以后，全年牲口开支只有一千三百元。南王段农业生产合作社牲口改为私有后，仅节省牲口开支部分就使每户多收入了一百斤粮食。
    二、节省饲料，喂养周到，牲口不掉膘。胡家楼农业生产合作社牲口夥有夥喂时，一头骡子一年喂料两石；转为私有私喂以后，只用四、五斗料就够了。（因为养牲口户可以把平时磨面剩余的粮食渣子以及一些剩饭汤做饲料）。各户对自己的牲口也特别爱护，喂得很周到。
    三、社内骨干在经营管理上减少了很多麻烦和负担。
    四、社员使用方便，而且有利可图，可以提高购买、喂养和繁殖牲口的积极性。杜树村农民王万藻有种驴一头，在牲口归社以后，就没有人牵牲口来配种了；改为私有以后，他的种驴每集可配种七、八头。
