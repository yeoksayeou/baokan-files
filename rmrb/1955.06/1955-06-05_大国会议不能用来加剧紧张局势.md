    The current international opinion is closely watching the development of the issue of the summit meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. People know that there are significant differences in attitudes among the four governments regarding this meeting. On the one hand, there is the Soviet Union, which has always held a positive attitude towards holding a summit of the four heads of government and has sincerely worked to promote the success of this meeting; on the other hand, there is the United States, which, under the pressure of the strong desire of the people of all countries to ease international tensions, cannot directly refuse the meeting, but is trying to narrow the significance of the meeting, and even wants to obstruct or undermine it.
    The Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on May 26 expressed the Soviet Union's positive attitude towards the summit meeting of the four heads of government and denounced the U.S. government's attempt to obstruct or undermine the meeting. The note stated: "The Soviet government, as it has stated many times in the past, still believes that the task of the summit meeting of the four major powers is to ease international tensions and enhance mutual trust between countries. This goal can only be achieved if all relevant countries work towards this end." People of all countries can see very clearly from this note: whether the summit of the four major powers can achieve positive results depends on whether the United States can abandon its destructive policy and conduct negotiations realistically.
    Before and after the publication of the Soviet government's note, people from all walks of life and fair-minded public opinion in various countries also widely condemned the U.S. attitude towards the summit of the four major powers. The Anglo-Soviet Friendship Society, in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, pointed out that the U.S. attitude "virtually undermines any satisfactory negotiation in advance." The "Hindustan Standard" also said in an editorial on May 26: "Dulles seems determined to stifle it (referring to the summit of the four major powers) with an indifferent cold attitude." Even Benjamin Cohen, former U.S. representative to the United Nations Disarmament Commission, was dissatisfied with the U.S. attitude towards the meeting, saying that it was difficult to consider this attitude "wise or mature."
    The U.S. ruling clique had nothing to say about the Soviet note and the solemn condemnation of public opinion in various countries. Therefore, they insisted that the purpose of the Soviet note was to "split the West," attempting to divert people's attention. At the same time, they deliberately sought disputes on the issue of the meeting location proposed by the Soviet Union. Of course, what deserves special attention is not these, but that some leaders of the U.S. government have not changed their attitude towards the summit of the four major powers and even attempted to intensify the implementation of their plan to undermine the meeting. The U.S. "Newsweek" on May 30 revealed that the heads of the U.S. government "do not expect the summit of the four major powers to solve any major problems," and said that the U.S. will raise the so-called communist "subversive activities" and China's "aggression" issues at the meeting. This means that the U.S. not only attempts to use the summit of the four major powers to interfere in the internal affairs of the European People's Democratic countries, as it recently expressed, but also wants to use the summit of the four powers to interfere in the internal affairs of the Chinese people in liberating Taiwan. People know that at the recently concluded Bandung Conference, the United States instructed some people to raise similar issues to undermine that meeting, but the result was a shameful failure. Now, the U.S. ruling clique is trying to play this trick again at the summit of the four major powers to undermine this meeting, which can only prove that they have lost their minds and sense of reality. Their intention, as pointed out in the Soviet note, is to strengthen the Cold War and further aggravate tensions.
    In order to promote the plan to make the summit of the four major powers fail, Western news agencies have recently continuously reported that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will hold a unilateral meeting in New York on June 16 to discuss the "strategy" of the Western countries for the summit of the four major powers. A spokesman for the U.S. State Department announced that the U.S. would also conduct such consultations with officials of the Bonn government. At the same time, people must also note that the United States and its Western European partners, including the Bonn government, are recently conducting a series of intense activities on the German issue, with the aim of resolutely obstructing German reunification, obstructing Germany from taking the path of peace, and intensifying the rearmament of West Germany. The Adenauer government of West Germany impatiently submitted a bill on the establishment of volunteer troops to the West German Senate. Western news agencies, when reporting this matter, could not but admit that the purpose of this approach "is to show that West Germany plans to rearm even before the upcoming 'highest level' meeting." It can be seen that the United States and its West German partners are trying to block the opportunity for the peaceful restoration of German reunification in an attempt to further deteriorate the international situation before the summit of the four major powers.
    The United States has taken the same approach on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. On this issue, the Soviet government put forward a new proposal on May 11. This proposal eliminates the obstacles that existed in disarmament and the establishment of international supervision in many respects, thus paving the way for a complete agreement between the major powers on this issue. Western countries, especially the United States, cannot openly oppose this proposal, but they are doing their best to delay or even refuse to discuss the Soviet proposal. U.S. Representative Wadsworth did just that at the resumed meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee on June 1. He insisted that it would be "unrealistic" to conduct discussions before the arrangements for the summit of the four major powers are clarified. This statement is certainly not convincing. Because if the Disarmament Subcommittee can make progress in discussing the Soviet proposal, it will obviously help to create a good atmosphere for the summit of the four major powers. The U.S. representative's use of the planned summit of the four major powers to obstruct the disarmament negotiations can only show that the U.S. ruling clique is neither willing to disarm and ban atomic weapons nor willing to make any positive efforts to promote the summit of the four major powers.
    All of this shows that the recent statements of some U.S. newspapers are not without reason. The U.S. "Time" magazine said that Wall Street merchants are worried about the upcoming summit of the four major powers and other signs of recent easing of international tensions. The prices of New York stocks, especially military stocks, have fallen sharply because "there are almost daily signs of easing international tensions." Therefore, according to the "American Daily": the U.S. "State Department is not in a high mood for holding a summit of the four major powers with the Russians"; therefore, the U.S. "Fortune" magazine in its June issue directly advocated: "Convincing European public opinion that the strategy of intimidation will still play a decisive role is the most important task of U.S. diplomacy in recent months." This reveals the real intention of why the U.S. monopoly capital is trying to undermine the summit of the four major powers and aggravate international tensions.
    It should be pointed out that the attitude of the British government cannot but make people express doubt. Before the British general election, British government officials had repeatedly stated that the summit meeting of the four heads of government would have to discuss substantive issues. British Prime Minister Eden also stated on the eve of the British general election: "I hope we have ample time at the meeting." These statements by British officials are different from the attitude of the United States. However, after the results of the general election were revealed, British government officials, such as British Ambassador to the United States Makins, said that Britain agreed with the United States that the meeting would not solve any problems or make any decisions. This situation shows that some people in Britain are still following the U.S. position on the issue of the summit of the four major powers. Whether the more positive attitude expressed by British officials towards the summit of the four major powers in the general election is a political trick to win votes remains to be answered from the actual actions of the British government.
    To make the summit of the four heads of government a productive meeting, arduous struggles must be carried out. If the summit of the four major powers fails due to the planning that the U.S. ruling clique is already carrying out, it will not only fail to produce the positive results that the people of all countries hope for, but on the contrary, it will increase distrust and divisions between countries and make the international situation more serious. This is what the U.S. monopoly group hopes for, but it is not what the people can tolerate. The common demand of the people of all countries to ease international tensions has forced the United States to agree to hold the summit of the four heads of government. Now, the people of all countries will continue to work hard to force it to hold meetings and consultations seriously.

    大国会议不能用来加剧紧张局势
    高集
    目前，国际舆论密切注视着苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑会议问题的发展。人们知道，在对待这个会议的问题上，四国政府间有着显著的不同的态度。一方面是苏联，它一直对举行四国政府首脑会议抱着积极的态度，并真诚地为着促进这个会议的成功而努力；另一方面是美国，它在各国人民要求缓和国际局势的强大愿望的压力下，无法直接拒绝这个会议，但是它却在努力缩小会议的意义，甚至想阻挠或者破坏它。
    苏联政府五月二十六日致美、英、法三国政府的照会表示了苏联对于四国政府首脑会议的积极态度，指斥了美国政府阻挠或破坏这个会议的企图。照会中说：“苏联政府像过去曾经多次声明的一样，仍然认为四大国最高级会议的任务是要缓和国际紧张局势，增强国与国之间的相互信任。只有所有有关国家都为此努力，这个目标才能达到。”各国人民从这个照会中看得很清楚：四大国会议是否能够取得积极的结果，关键在于美国是否能够放弃它的破坏政策，来实事求是地进行商谈。
    在苏联政府的照会发表的前后，各国广泛的社会人士和公正舆论也纷纷谴责美国对四大国会议的态度。英苏友好协会在写给美国国务卿杜勒斯的一封信中，指出美国的态度“实际上事先就破坏了任何圆满的谈判”。“印度斯坦旗报”在五月二十六日的社论中也说：“杜勒斯似乎是决心用漠不关心的冷淡态度来扼杀它（指四大国会议）”。甚至前美国出席联合国裁军委员会的代表本杰明·柯恩也不满意美国对会议的态度，他说很难认为这种态度是“明智的或者成熟的”。
    美国统治集团对于苏联照会和各国舆论的严正谴责是无话可说的。因此他们就硬说苏联照会的目的在于“分裂西方”，企图借此来转移人们的视线。同时他们还故意在苏联所提出的会议地点问题上寻找争端。当然，值得人们特别注意的不是这些，而是美国政府的一些首脑人物至今还没有改变他们对四大国会议的态度，甚至还企图把他们破坏会议的计划加紧实施。五月三十日的美国“新闻周刊”就透露说：美国政府首脑“并不期望四大国会议解决任何重大问题”，并且说美国将在会议上提出所谓共产党“颠覆活动”和中国的“侵略”问题。这就是说，美国不仅如前不久所表示的那样，企图利用四大国会议来干涉欧洲人民民主国家内政，它还想利用四国会议来干涉中国人民解放台湾的内政问题。人们知道，在不久前结束的万隆会议上，美国曾指使一些人提出过类似的问题来破坏那个会议，但是结果却遭到了可耻的失败。现在，美国统治集团又企图在四大国会议上玩弄这一套来破坏这个会议，这只能证明他们已经失去了理智和现实感。他们的这种打算，正如苏联照会所指出的，就是想加强冷战，进一步加剧紧张局势。
    为了推行使四大国会议失败的计划，最近西方国家的通讯社已不断传出，美、英、法三国外长将于六月十六日在纽约举行片面的会谈，来商订西方国家对四大国会议的“战略”。美国国务院的发言人并宣布，美国还要和波恩政府的官员们进行这类磋商。同时，人们也必须注意到，美国和它西欧的伙伴，包括波恩政府在内，最近在德国问题上正在进行一系列的紧张活动，目的是坚决阻挠德国统一，阻挠德国走和平的道路，加紧重新武装西德。西德的阿登纳政府迫不及待地向西德参议院提出了一个关于建立志愿兵部队的法案。西方通讯社在报道这件事情的时候，也不能不承认这种做法的目的“在于表明西德甚至于在即将到来的‘最高级’会议以前，就计划进行重新武装”。由此可见，美国和它的西德伙伴正在力图堵死和平恢复德国统一的机会，来在四大国会议之前进一步恶化国际局势。
    美国在裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题上，也采取了同样的做法。在这个问题上，苏联政府已在五月十一日提出了一个新的建议。这个建议在很多方面消除了在裁减军备和建立国际监督问题上存在着的障碍，因而为大国之间就这个问题达成完全的协议开辟了道路。西方国家，首先是美国，不能公开反对这个建议，但是却竭力拖延甚至拒绝对苏联建议的讨论。美国代表华兹沃斯在六月一日恢复举行的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上就是这样做的。他硬说在四大国会议的安排加以澄清以前就进行讨论将是“不现实的”。这种说法当然不能令人信服。因为如果裁军小组委员会能够在讨论苏联的建议上获得进展，显然就会有助于为四大国会议创造良好的气氛。美国代表用在筹划中的四大国会议来阻挠裁军问题的谈判，只能表明美国统治集团既不愿意裁军和禁止原子武器，也不愿意为促进四大国会议作任何积极的努力。
    所有这一切，都说明了最近美国一些报刊的说法不是没有来由的。美国的“时代”周刊就说，华尔街的商人们对于四大国会议的将要召开和最近国际局势趋向缓和的其他迹象，感到担心。纽约股票，特别是军火股票的价格竟因为“差不多每天都有国际紧张局势趋向缓和的迹象”而大大下降。因此，据“美国人日报”说：美国“国务院对于举行有俄国人参加的四大国会议情绪不高”；因此，美国
  “幸福”杂志六月号更直接了当地主张：“叫欧洲舆论相信威吓战略仍将起决定作用，这就是美国外交在最近几个月中的最重要的任务。”这就和盘托出了美国垄断资本为什么力图破坏四大国会议，加剧国际紧张局势的用心。
    应当指出，英国政府的态度也不能不令人表示怀疑。在英国大选以前，英国政府人士曾经不断表示，四国政府首脑会议将不得不讨论实质问题。英国首相艾登并在英国大选前夕表示：“我希望我们在会议上有充分的时间。”英国当政人物的这些表示同美国的态度是有所不同的。但是，在大选的结果揭晓之后，英国政府人士，像英国驻美大使麦金斯就说，英国同意美国的看法，（四大国）会议将不会解决任何问题，或作出任何决定。这种情形表明，英国的某些人士在四大国会议问题上还是追随着美国的立场。英国的当政人物在大选中对于四大国会议所表示的比较积极的态度，是不是一种捞取选票的政治手腕，还要从英国政府的实际行动中来得到解答。
    要使四国政府首脑会议成为一个有成效的会议，还必须进行艰巨的斗争。如果四大国会议由于美国统治集团已在进行中的策划而遭到失败，那就不但不会产生各国人民所希望的积极结果，相反的，还将增加国与国之间的不信任和分歧，使国际局势更为严重。这是美国垄断集团所希望的，但却是人民所不能容许的。各国人民要求缓和国际局势的共同要求曾迫使美国同意召开四国政府首脑会议，现在各国人民必将继续努力，迫使它认真地举行会议，进行协商。
