    Precisely to be Responsible to the Country
    — The Story of Chen Huaiyin, a Young Worker at Southwest Steel Company, Sorting Steel Ingots
    Chen Zhewu
    In the morning, thick fog obscured the early summer sun, and faint blue sparks flickered in the steelmaking workshop, with thick smoke billowing from the chimneys and scattering in the morning breeze.

    The workers in the steel ingot sorting team of the steelmaking workshop arrived at the workshop early in the morning. After preparing for sorting the steel ingots, everyone wielded their air compression guns and worked diligently. Only Chen Huaiyin, a member of the Communist Youth League, carefully examined each steel ingot to be sorted on the construction site. As usual, he put on his work clothes, put on his canvas gloves, and carefully inspected each steel ingot that needed to be sorted with an air compression gun. After careful inspection, he would work hard at it. Doing this saved much more time than sorting one steel ingot and then looking for the second, and sorting the second and then looking for the third. Chen Huaiyin saw that the technical supervisors had marked many steel ingots as substandard with chalk, and he thought, "Why are there so many defective products? What a pity! ... No, the steel was tested when it came out of the furnace, and the quality of the steel has been good recently, so there can't be so many defective products."

    Sorting steel ingots is the final process in steelmaking operations. After the molten steel is poured into steel ingots, the steel ingot is only a blank, and many "slag inclusions" and "cracks" (steel ingot defects) often appear on the surface. Some of these "slag inclusions" and "cracks" are not serious, and as long as they are sorted, the slight "slag inclusions" and "cracks" can be completely eliminated. Generally, after steel ingots are sorted, it is of great significance to the rolling mill for rolling various steels, especially for improving the quality of steel. However, if the technical supervisor marks a steel ingot as substandard, it means that the steel ingot is scrapped, and the scrapped steel ingot no longer needs to be sorted.

    Today, so many steel ingots have been scrapped, and Chen Huaiyin is really worried.

    "A steel ingot is worth more than four hundred yuan!" Chen Huaiyin stood on the steel ingot, staring blankly at the steel ingot and muttered to himself: "How can we let it be wasted so casually! No, there can't be so many steel ingots scrapped, the technical supervisor must have made a mistake."

    As if he suddenly thought of something, he squatted down, with a pair of bright eyes, carefully looked at the steel ingots marked as substandard, took off his canvas gloves, and stroked the steel ingots with his hands. He suddenly smiled, but immediately restrained his smile, put on his gloves, and wielded the air compression gun, chiseling a few times with a "dut, dut, dut" sound. A look of great anger suddenly appeared on his dark face:

    "Good fellow! The supervisor is too irresponsible, really a spendthrift!"

    He looked around the construction site for a while and found the technical supervisor.

    "Is the quality of steel ingots good recently?" Chen Huaiyin asked.

    "It's much worse," the supervisor pointed to a row of steel ingots in front and continued, "Look, those are all defective products."

    "Are those all scrapped?" Chen Huaiyin asked.

    "Yes," the supervisor nodded and replied, "Anything that is marked is not up to standard."

    "That can't be right!"

    "Who's lying to you? If you don't believe me, go and see!"

    "Okay," Chen Huaiyin patted the supervisor on the shoulder: "Let's go together."

    They came to the other side of the construction site.

    "Look, Comrade Supervisor," Chen Huaiyin pointed to the steel ingot he had looked at earlier and said, "Why is this steel ingot substandard?"

    "Slag inclusion, this slag inclusion is too serious."

    The supervisor looked at the mark he had made on the steel ingot with chalk and replied like this.

    "No, this is surface slag inclusion!"

    "Of course," the supervisor said, "Doesn't the naked eye see the surface, can it see inside the steel ingot?"

    "Surface slag inclusion can be removed."

    "Remove it?"

    "Yes, removing it can turn it into a good steel ingot."

    "It won't work, will it?" The supervisor shook his head and said, "This slag inclusion is too serious, how can it be removed?"

    "Yes, it can be removed completely." Chen Huaiyin pointed to a steel ingot containing slag inclusion that had been removed and said, "Look, hasn't this been removed!"

    The supervisor squatted down and looked at it, still shaking his head and saying, "No, although this point has been removed, could it be that all these scrapped steel ingots have the same problem?"

    "I've seen them all," Chen Huaiyin said, "They're all the same as this one, and they can be removed completely."

    "Don't be too subjective," the supervisor said to Chen Huaiyin in a reproachful tone, "To be honest, I've crossed more bridges in this line of work than you've walked roads. Please accept technical supervision!"

    "Of course I will obey you if you are really responsible!"

    The supervisor got a little angry when he heard this: "Who isn't responsible? I'm doing this to be responsible to the country. I can't be sloppy!"

    Chen Huaiyin couldn't bear it anymore: "Please check it again carefully! I came to you precisely to be responsible to the country!"

    They began to argue when the two sentences didn't agree. The supervisor still insisted on his own opinion: "This is how it is, this is how it is... If you have the ability, remove all the slag inclusions."

    "Okay, you wait and see," Chen Huaiyin turned his head and went to get the air compression gun. He said as he walked, "You won't believe it if I don't remove them, it's useless to reason with you."

    Chen Huaiyin put on his gloves, wielded the air compression gun and started working with a "dut, dut, dut" sound.

    At this time, the morning fog had dissipated, and the warm sunlight shone in from the skylight of the steelmaking furnace, illuminating Chen Huaiyin's dark face. The air compression gun in Chen Huaiyin's hand sparkled with countless beautiful sparks in the sunlight with a "dut, dut, dut" sound.

    One minute, two minutes passed, and the sweat on Chen Huaiyin's forehead dripped down like raindrops. Two hours later, all the "scrapped" steel ingots on the construction site had been sorted - the slag inclusions on the steel ingots had been chiseled clean by him with an air compression gun. He wiped the sweat from his forehead, took off his gloves, and carefully looked at each sorted steel ingot again. Then he called the technical supervisor over.

    "How is it, Comrade Supervisor," Chen Huaiyin said, "Please check it again."

    The supervisor looked at it carefully and couldn't find any problems. What else could he say? He was very moved and regretted in his heart that he shouldn't have argued with Chen Huaiyin, and felt that he hadn't fulfilled his responsibilities. He redrew a circle on each steel ingot with chalk. Then, he tightly held Chen Huaiyin's hand and said, "I was wrong, thank you. I will take responsibility seriously in the future!" Chen Huaiyin also smiled and replied, "We will keep in touch more in the future. I will definitely accept technical supervision." (Originally published in Sichuan Daily)

    正是为了对国家负责
    ——西南钢铁公司青年工人陈怀银整理钢锭的故事
    陈哲武
    早晨，浓雾遮蔽了初夏的阳光，炼钢场工地上隐隐约约地闪烁朵朵蔚蓝色的火花，烟囱里喷吐出的团团浓烟，在晨风中四处飘散。
    炼钢车间整理班整理钢锭的工人们，一早就来到了车间。把整理钢锭的准备工作做好后，大家便挥起空气压缩枪“督督督督”地干起活来。只有青年团员陈怀银却依然在工地上细心地察看即将整理的每一根钢锭。他像往常一样，穿上工作服，把帆布手套戴好之后，提着空气压缩枪在每一根需要整理的钢锭上细心地审视。看好后，他就一股劲干下去。他这样做，比整理了一根钢锭再去寻找第二根，整理了第二根再去寻找第三根，省时得多。陈怀银在工地上看见在许多根钢锭上，技术监督工都用粉笔打有不合规格的记号，他想：“为什么会有这样多废品呢？多可惜呀！……不，钢水出炉时都化验过，近来钢的质量也还不错，绝不会有这样多的废品。”
    整理钢锭是炼钢操作中最后一道工序。钢水出炉浇成钢锭之后，钢锭仅是一个毛坯，往往在表面上出现许多“夹砂”和“裂缝”（钢锭病疵）。这些“夹砂”和“裂缝”有的并不严重，只要经过一番整理，轻微的“夹砂”和“裂缝”便可以消除干净。一般的钢锭经过整理后，对轧钢车间轧制各种钢材，尤其是提高钢材的质量有极大的意义。但是，如果技术监督工在钢锭上划有不合规格的记号，就表示这根钢锭报废了，报废了的钢锭便不再需要整理。
    今天，报废了的钢锭这么多，陈怀银真要急坏了。
      “一根钢锭要值四百多元哩！”陈怀银站在钢锭上，两眼发呆地望着钢锭自言自语：“怎能随随便便让它浪费！不，不会有这么多根钢锭报废，一定是技术监督工看错了。”
    他像忽然想起了什么，蹲下来，闪着一对炯炯发光的眼睛，在划有不合规格的记号的钢锭上仔细看看，又取下帆布手套，用手抚摸着钢锭。他忽然笑起来了，但马上又收敛了笑容，戴上手套，挥起空气压缩枪“督督督督”地凿了几下。他那黑黝黝的脸上顿时露出了十分愤怒的神色：
      “好家伙！监督工太不负责任了，真是个败家子！”
    他在工地上找了一会，找到了技术监督工。
      “最近钢锭的质量好不？”陈怀银问道。
      “差多啦，”监督工指着前面一排钢锭继续说道：“你看，那些都是废品。”
      “那些是不是全都报废了？”陈怀银问道。
      “嗯，”监督工点着头回答：“凡是打了记号的，都不合乎规格。”
      “不会吧！”
    “哪个骗你？要不信你去看吧！”
      “好吧，”陈怀银拍了一下监督工的肩膀：
  “我们一道去。”
    他们来到了工地的另一边。
      “你看，监督工同志，”陈怀银指着自己先前看的那根钢锭说：“这根钢锭为啥不合规格？”
      “夹砂，这夹砂太严重了。”
    监督工看了一看钢锭上自己用粉笔划的记号，便这样回答。
      “不，这是表面夹砂！”
    “当然啰，”监督工说：“肉眼不是看表面，难道还能看到钢锭里面去吗？”
      “表面夹砂打掉就行。”
      “打掉？”
      “嗯，打掉了就可以变成好钢锭。”
      “不行吧？”监督工摇头说：“这夹砂太严重了，哪能打得掉？”
      “能，完全能打掉。”陈怀银指着已经打掉的一根含有夹砂的钢锭说：“你看，这不是打掉了么！”
    监督工蹲下来看了一看，仍然摇着头说：“不行，这一点虽然打掉了，难道这么多报废了的钢锭都是这一个毛病？”
    “我都看过了，”陈怀银说：“都跟这一样，完全能打掉。”
      “不要太主观了，”监督工带着教训的口吻对陈怀银说：“说实话，在干这一行上我过的桥比你走的路多。请你接受技术监督吧！”
      “如果你真的负责任，当然我要服从你！”
    监督工一听这话，有些冒火了：“谁不负责？我这样做，就是为了对国家负责。我可不能马马虎虎！”
    陈怀银再也忍不住了：“请你再仔细检验一遍！我正是为了对国家负责才来找你！”
    两句话不对头，他们便争论起来了。监督工仍然坚持着自己的意见：“这样，就是这样……有本事你就把夹砂都打掉。”
    “好，你等着看吧，”陈怀银一扭头便去拿空气压缩枪去了。他边走边说：“不打掉你是不相信的，跟你讲道理没有用。”
    陈怀银把手套戴上，挥起空气压缩枪便“督督督督”地干起来了。
    这时，晨雾已经消散，暖和的太阳光从炼钢炉的天窗射进来，把陈怀银那张黑黝黝的脸照得发光。陈怀银手里的空气压缩枪在阳光中“督督督督”地闪亮着无数朵美丽的火花。
    一分钟两分钟过去了，陈怀银额头上的汗珠雨点般直往下淌。两个钟头以后，工地上所有“报废”了的钢锭都整理好了——钢锭上的夹砂都被他用空气压缩枪凿得干干净净。他揩去额头上的汗水，把手套取下来，又仔细地把每一根整理好了的钢锭看了一遍。随后便把技术监督工找来了。
    “怎样，监督工同志，”陈怀银说：“请你再检验一下。”
    监督工仔细地看了一看，什么毛病也找不出来了。这还有什么话说呢？他心里非常感动，边看边后悔自己不应该同陈怀银争论，觉得自己没有尽到责任。他在每一根钢锭上重新用粉笔划了一个圈。然后，紧紧握住陈怀银的手说道：“是我错了，谢谢你。以后我要认真负起责任来！”陈怀银也笑着回答他：“以后我们多联系。我一定接受技术监督。”（原载四川日报）
