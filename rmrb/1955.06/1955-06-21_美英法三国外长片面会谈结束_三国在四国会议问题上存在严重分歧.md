Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 18th, TASS dispatch: The meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France in New York ended on the 17th. A brief joint communique was issued after the meeting, but its wording was so vague that it was impossible to determine the specific content of the talks.

From the communique, it appears that the three foreign ministers discussed the Soviet government's note of June 13 to the three governments regarding a meeting of the heads of government of the four countries. The communique stated that "the time has come to make new efforts to eliminate" the "root causes" of international "conflict."

The communique went on to say that the foreign ministers held talks with Chancellor Adenauer. The communique itself did not mention the content of these talks, but according to American newspapers, the talks included the question of inviting Adenauer to Moscow.

The communique also stated that before the Geneva four-power summit, the three Western powers will consult with other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Paris.

The communique specifically mentioned that the three Western countries intend to continue to pursue the same "common policy" that they have pursued in the past.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 19th, TASS dispatch: Reports by American journalists on the results of the separate talks held by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France indicate that the talks revealed serious differences among the participants regarding the upcoming four-power summit. The vague nature of the communique issued by the three foreign ministers specifically illustrates this point. For example, the communique avoids mentioning specific issues that newspapers reported to be the subject of the talks.

The newspapers said that the United States was unable to get the principle of limiting the scope of the issues to be discussed at the meeting adopted. The foreign ministers did not reach agreement on a draft agenda for the meeting they intended to discuss with Molotov in San Francisco. In order to avoid protracted debates, the three foreign ministers decided not to put forward any draft agenda, but to let the heads of government decide for themselves what issues to discuss. It is reported that the United States insisted on a strict agenda for the meeting.

A UPI commentator said that the Western foreign ministers spent a lot of time discussing the situation in the Far East and the issue of disarmament. During the discussions, US Secretary of State Dulles opposed including these issues in the agenda of the Geneva Conference. However, his efforts to persuade the other two foreign ministers to agree with his opposition were unsuccessful.

The Soviet proposals on disarmament and on the normalization of relations with the Federal Republic of Germany were issues that were discussed at length at the meeting of the three foreign ministers. The content of the meeting on the morning of June 17 was entirely a "secret" discussion of the Soviet proposal on normalizing relations with West Germany and Adenauer's proposed trip to Moscow. According to AP reporter Goldberg, the meeting on the morning of June 17 showed that the French Foreign Minister was very dissatisfied with Adenauer's separate negotiations with Dulles and Eisenhower on this issue. The reporter said that Pinay expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the United States had already reached an agreement with Adenauer, and the French Foreign Minister only needed to put a rubber stamp on it. The "Daily Mirror" also said that Adenauer and Eisenhower had fully coordinated the views of the United States and Germany, so it can be assumed that France only needs to agree to the agreement that has been reached. Pinay expressed dissatisfaction with this fact.

"New York Times" reporter Hamilton reported that news published by the "New York Times" about what Eisenhower and Adenauer discussed in Washington aroused the anger of the French, and this angry mood disturbed the atmosphere of the meeting. From a report by this reporter, it can be concluded that considerable differences were exposed in the discussion of European security issues.

As Hamilton reported, the US dissatisfaction with the results of the meeting was reflected in the fact that after the meeting, the US representative only read the communique to reporters, without expressing any opinions. All supplementary information about what happened that day was obtained from British, French, or West German sources.

### 美英法三国外长片面会谈结束  三国在四国会议问题上存在严重分歧

    美英法三国外长片面会谈结束
    三国在四国会议问题上存在严重分歧
    新华社十九日讯塔斯社纽约十八日讯：美国、英国和法国三国外长在纽约举行的会谈在十七日结束。会谈结束后发表了一个简短的联合公报，公报的措词十分含糊，因而无法判断会谈的具体内容。
    从公报中看，三国外长讨论了苏联政府六月十三日就四国政府首脑会议问题致三国政府的照会。公报说，“进行新的努力来消除”国际“冲突的根源的时机已经到来了”。
    公报接着说，外长们同阿登纳总理进行了会谈。公报本身没有提到这次会谈的内容，但是，据美国报纸指出，会谈中讨论了有关阿登纳被邀请到莫斯科去的问题。
    公报又说，在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议举行之前，西方三国将同北大西洋集团的其他成员国在巴黎进行磋商。
    公报特别提到，西方三个国家今后还打算执行它们以前所执行的那种“共同政策”。
    新华社十九日讯塔斯社纽约十九日讯：美国记者关于美英法三国外长单独举行的会谈的结果的报道表明：这次会谈显示了参加会谈的人在有关即将举行的四大国政府首脑会议的问题上存在着严重分歧。三国外长发表的公报的含糊性质具体说明了这一点。例如，公报避而不谈据报纸消息说是会谈主题的一些具体问题。
    报纸说，美国没有能够使把会议要讨论的问题的范围加以限制的原则得到通过。外长们没有就他们打算在旧金山同莫洛托夫讨论的会议议程草案取得一致意见。为了避免旷日持久的辩论，三国外长决定不提出任何议程草案，而让政府首脑们自己去决定要讨论的问题。据悉美国方面曾经坚持会议有一个严格的议程。
    合众社评论员说，西方三国外长花了很多时间讨论远东局势和裁军问题，在讨论中间美国国务卿杜勒斯反对把这些问题列入日内瓦会议议程。可是，他想使其他两个外长同意他的反对意见的努力没有成功。
    苏联关于裁军问题和关于同德意志联邦共和国的关系正常化的建议，是三国外长会议上作了长时间的讨论的问题。六月十七日上午的会议的内容完全是“秘密”讨论苏联关于同西德的关系正常化的建议和阿登纳的拟议中的莫斯科之行。据美联社记者戈德堡报道，六月十七日上午的会议表明，法国外长对于阿登纳就这个问题同杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔举行的单独谈判非常不满。这位记者说，比内对这一事实表示不满：美国已经同阿登纳达成了协议，法国外长只需在上面盖一个橡皮图章就行了。“每日镜报”也说，阿登纳和艾森豪威尔已经完全协调了美国和德国的看法，因此可以认为法国只消同意已经达成的协议就行了，比内对这一事实表示不满。
      “纽约时报”记者汉密尔顿报道，“纽约时报”刊载的关于艾森豪威尔和阿登纳在华盛顿讨论了什么问题的消息引起了法国人的愤怒，法国人的这种愤怒情绪扰乱了会议的气氛。从这个记者的一篇报道中可以得出这样的结论：在讨论欧洲安全问题时暴露出相当大的分歧。
    如汉密尔顿所报道的，美国对于会议结果的不满情绪从这一事实上表现了出来：会议结束以后，美国代表只是对记者们宣读了公报，而没有发表任何意见。所有关于那天发生的情况的补充消息，都是从英国、法国或者西德的人士那里得到的。
