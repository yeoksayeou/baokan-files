Many leaders of organizations, factories, enterprises, schools, and hospitals in Shanghai are personally reviewing their units' grain budget estimates. Wang Zhongyi, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Shanghai Electric Power Administration Bureau Committee, after attending a municipal party committee meeting on grain issues, immediately convened a joint meeting of the secretaries of the 14 subordinate grassroots party organizations that afternoon to inspect the grain budget for June. The meeting found that the June grain budget was extremely unreasonable, with an increase of more than 20,000 jin compared to the actual consumption in April. He immediately conducted a strict criticism of those present. After returning, the secretaries of the grassroots party committees re-led their units in revising their plans. Now, the grain plan for June for the 14 units in the bureau as a whole has been reduced by nearly 40,000 jin compared to the original plan.

The June grain plan for Fudan University was revised three times, each time more accurate than the last. When Vice-President Yang Xiguang reviewed the plan, he found that too much revolving grain was being retained. After repeated verification, the result was a reduction of another 8,750 jin.

The heads of party and administrative affairs in many units have also mobilized party members and the masses to discuss measures to oppose wasting grain and save grain. The leaders of some units did not pay enough attention to the grain plan, but have improved after criticism from the party newspaper and higher-level leaders.

According to preliminary statistics from approximately 3,000 mess halls in seven districts, including Xuhui, Zhabei, and Lao Zha, the actual grain consumption in May was more than one million jin less than the original plan, and the budgeted amount for June has been further reduced.

    上海市许多机关工厂负责人亲自审核用粮预决算
    上海市许多机关、工厂、企业、学校、医院的负责人，亲自审核本单位用粮预决算。中共上海电业管理局委员会书记王中一，在参加了一次市委有关粮食问题的会议以后，当天下午就召开所属十四个基层党组织的书记联席会议，检查六月份用粮预算。会上发现六月份用粮预算极不合理，比四月份的实际消费量增加了两万多斤，当即对与会者进行严格的批判。各基层党委书记回去后，又重新领导本单位修订计划。现全局十四个单位六月份用粮计划比原计划降低了近四万斤。
    复旦大学的六月份用粮计划先后做了三次修改，一次比一次准确。副校长杨西光在审核计划时，发现周转粮留得过多，经过反复核实后，结果又核减了八千七百五十斤。
    许多单位党和行政的负责人还发动党员和群众讨论反对浪费粮食和节约粮食的措施。有些单位的领导人对用粮计划重视不够，经党报和上级领导批评后，也已经改进。
    现据徐汇、闸北、老闸等七个区三千户左右伙食团的初步统计，五月份实际消费的粮食比原订计划减少了一百多万斤，六月份的预算数量比这又有了降低。　（新华社）
