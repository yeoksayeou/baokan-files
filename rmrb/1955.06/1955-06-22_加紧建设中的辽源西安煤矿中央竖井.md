Intensified Construction of the Central Shaft of Liaoyuan Xi'an Coal Mine
Xu Jiachen

The newly built central shaft project in the Xi'an coal mine area of Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province, has completed nearly 80 percent of its total workload. This pair of shafts, designed with the help of the Soviet Union and equipped with new Soviet equipment, are large-scale shafts. At present, the construction of more than thirty factory buildings above the wells, and the installation of giant winders, air compressors, and other mechanical and electrical equipment, have mostly been completed or are nearing completion. The new cage, one of the hoisting equipment for the auxiliary shaft, has also been installed. As soon as you arrive at the construction site, you can see and hear: on a pair of tall steel headframes, the wheels of the winder are turning and roaring. The tunnel excavation and concrete arch lining project for the underground loading station at the bottom of the two shafts, several hundred meters deep, has also been completed. The tunnels extending from the two underground loading stations to various mining areas are intertwined like spider webs. Before this pair of shafts is handed over to production, the miners have to build dozens of *li* of tunnels underground. Now, they have completed four-fifths of the tunnels.

Currently, the mining and excavating workers are concentrating their efforts on the construction of three underground mining areas and associated tunnels. Installation workers are carrying out the installation of mechanical and electrical equipment inside the auxiliary shaft. Among them, the employees of the electrical detachment of the installation work area are laying cables in the auxiliary shaft; the employees of the iron pipe detachment are installing eight pipeline equipment in the auxiliary shaft. After they complete the installation of various equipment in the auxiliary shaft, they will concentrate their efforts on the installation of mechanical and electrical equipment in the main shaft and underground.

The central shaft of Xi'an Coal Mine started construction in November 1950. Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and higher-level administrative organs, with the help of Soviet experts and the support of people from all over the country, the workers constructing the shaft have carried out arduous labor, overcome many difficulties, and achieved great successes. In the early stage of shaft excavation, the manual single-line operation method was adopted, and the project progress was very slow. Later, Soviet experts proposed the adoption of mechanical parallel operation methods and many valuable suggestions. Due to the implementation of these suggestions and the promotion of advanced experiences such as the Gu Faming advanced group's deep rock drilling, the speed of well completion was greatly improved. The shaft construction project, which would have taken several years to complete according to the original schedule, was completed in only twenty-two months. In the underground tunnel construction, the workers implemented the "parallel flat tunnel operation" suggestion put forward by Soviet experts, learned the advanced experience of the Soviet "coulomb fracturing blasting," improved blasting efficiency, and greatly accelerated the speed of tunnel construction. They have created quite high records in the tunnel driving competition. In the construction of factory buildings above the ground, the construction speed was also accelerated due to winter construction. In the mechanical and electrical installation work, the employees of the Fushun Installation Company provided strong support for the construction of the central shaft of Xi'an Coal Mine: Under the guidance of Soviet experts, they adopted methods such as using old headframes and pre-assembling new headframes to erect a pair of steel headframes more than forty meters high. The workers who built the central shaft were very unfamiliar with the installation of new equipment such as large winders and air compressors. Everyone was afraid that even a hair's breadth of error in the installation would bring huge losses to the country. However, many technicians and workers who were responsible for the installation work humbly asked Soviet experts for advice. The task was completed and a lot of skills were learned by following the experts' advice. In the installation of shaft buntons and bunton beams, the youth shock team also created some good methods, which increased the efficiency of bunton installation by more than two times compared to the original.

In the process of constructing the central shaft of Xi'an Coal Mine, the work of the construction unit and the construction unit has many shortcomings, especially the management is relatively backward, and the waste is quite serious. At present, they are mobilizing employees to carry out a struggle against waste. Recently, after joint research by the construction unit and the construction unit, it was submitted to the higher authorities for approval to reduce the part of the project in the construction of this pair of shafts that can be temporarily not constructed, so that the state's investment can be reduced by more than 500,000 yuan.

In order to enable the central shaft of Xi'an Coal Mine to be handed over to production as soon as possible, the existing production units such as the Second and Third Mines of Fuguo Coal Mine of Xi'an Mining Bureau are vigorously supporting the construction of the central shaft. From April this year to the handover of the central shaft to production, Fuguo Coal Mine's Third Mine alone needs to build one-tenth of the entire tunnel length of the central shaft. Dozens of factories and mines across the country are rushing to manufacture some equipment and materials for the central shaft, or are training production personnel for the central shaft.

The production preparation work of the central shaft of Xi'an Coal Mine is also being intensified. A group of combined coal mining machine drivers are interning at Fuguo First Mine to mine coal with combined coal mining machines; more people are interning at the central shaft construction site and other production units of Xi'an Coal Mine; some people are still studying in schools; and many people are studying in fraternal enterprises such as Fushun and Jixi; dozens of comrades who have just returned from studying in the Soviet Union have also joined the production preparation work of the central shaft.

The people building the central shaft are stepping up their work, striving to put this pair of modern shafts into production this winter. After this pair of shafts is put into production, our country can get hundreds of thousands of tons of high-quality coal from here every year to supply the needs of industrial construction and transportation industries.

    加紧建设中的辽源西安煤矿中央竖井
    徐佳辰
    在吉林省辽源市西安煤矿区新建的中央竖井工程，已完成了将近总工作量的百分之八十。这一对竖井，是苏联帮助我国设计的，并且是用苏联的新式设备来装备的大型竖井。现在，井上的三十多处厂房建筑，巨型的绞车、压风机等机电设备安装工程，大部分已经结束或者快要结束了。副井提升设备之一的新式罐笼也安装完了。一到工地，人们就可以看见和听见：在一对高大的钢铁井架上，绞车的天轮在转动着、吼叫着。在两个好几百公尺深的井筒下边，井底车场的巷道开凿工程和混凝土发碹工程也结束了。从两个井底车场伸向各个采煤区的巷道，像蜘蛛网似的交织着。在这对竖井移交生产之前，矿工们要在井下修建数十华里长的巷道，现在，他们所完成的巷道已有五分之四了。
    目前，采掘工人们正集中力量进行井下三个采煤区和附属巷道的建设工作。安装工人们正进行副井井筒内的机电设备安装工作。其中安装工区电气分队的职工们正在敷设副井井筒里的电缆；铁管分队的职工们要在副井井筒里进行八趟管路设备的安装工作。他们把副井井筒内各种设备的安装工作完成以后，便要集中力量进行主井井筒内和井下机械电气设备的安装工作了。
    西安煤矿中央竖井是一九五○年十一月开工的，几年来，建设竖井的职工们，在党和上级行政机关的领导、苏联专家的帮助和祖国各地人民的支援下，进行了艰苦的劳动，克服了很多困难，取得了巨大的成就。井筒开凿初期，采用的是手工单行作业方法，工程进度很慢。后来，苏联专家提出了采用机械平行作业方法和许多宝贵建议，由于贯彻执行了这些建议和推广了谷发明先进小组深凿岩等先进经验，成井的速度大大提高了。按照原来进度需要好几年才能完工的井筒建设工程，仅仅用了二十二个月就完工了。在井下巷道建设中，职工们执行了苏联专家提出的“平巷平行作业”的建议，学习了苏联“龟裂爆破”的先进经验，提高了爆破效率，大大加快了巷道建设的速度。在巷道掘进竞赛中，曾创造过相当高的纪录。在井上厂房建筑中，由于进行了冬季施工，也加快了建设速度。在机电安装工作中，抚顺安装公司的职工们，对西安煤矿中央竖井的建设作了有力的支援：他们在苏联专家的指导下，采取了利用旧井架和预先组立好新井架等方法，使一对四十多公尺高的钢铁井架树立起来了。建设中央竖井的职工们，对于大型绞车、压风机等新式设备的安装工作都是很陌生的，大家生怕安差了一根头发丝那么细的距离都会给国家带来巨大损失，但许多担负安装工作的技术人员和工人们，虚心地向苏联专家请教。按照专家建议去作的结果，完成了任务，也学会了不少的本领。在井筒罐道、罐道梁的安装工作中，青年突击队员们还创造了一些好办法，使罐道安装效率比原来提高了两倍多。
    在西安煤矿中央竖井的建设过程中，建设单位和施工单位的工作有不少缺点，尤其是管理比较落后，浪费相当严重。目前，他们正在动员职工开展反对浪费的斗争。最近，经过建设单位和施工单位共同研究，呈准上级，把这对竖井建设中暂时可不建设的部分工程削减去，这样，可以减少国家五十多万元的投资。
    为了使西安煤矿中央竖井能够早日移交生产，西安矿务局富国煤矿二坑、三坑等现有生产单位，正在大力支援中央竖井的建设。仅富国煤矿三坑从今年四月到中央竖井移交生产前需要代建的巷道，就有中央竖井整个巷道长度的十分之一。全国各地有十数个厂矿正在为中央竖井赶制部分设备和材料，或者在为中央竖井培养训练生产人员。
    西安煤矿中央竖井的生产准备工作也正在加紧进行。一批联合采煤机司机正在富国一坑实习用联合采煤机采煤；更多的人员则在中央竖井工地和西安煤矿的其他生产单位实习；有一批人还在学校里学习；不少的人则在抚顺、鸡西等兄弟企业里学习；新从苏联学习回来的数十位同志，也参加了中央竖井的生产准备工作。
    建设中央竖井的人们正在加紧工作，争取今年冬天使这一对现代化的竖井投入生产。这一对竖井投入生产以后，我们的国家就可以每年从这里得到数十万吨质量优良的煤，以供应工业建设和交通运输业的需要。
