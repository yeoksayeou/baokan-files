Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 12th: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Aoi said on the 11th that if the United States genuinely suggests storing atomic or hydrogen bombs in Japan, Japan has the right to refuse any such suggestion from the United States. He pointed out that Japan is not bound by either the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" or the US-Japan "Security Treaty" when taking such action.

Shigemitsu emphasized that "Japan does not want to participate in another war, and it naturally opposes any suggestion to turn it into an atomic base."

Shigemitsu made these remarks in response to questions from left-wing Socialist Party members at the Senate Budget Committee.

Since the United States' plan to expand its main air force bases in Japan was revealed, the Japanese public has become increasingly concerned about the United States' attempt to turn Japan into its atomic base.

    重光葵在日参院预算委员会上说
    日本将拒绝美国把日本变成原子基地
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：日本外务相重光葵十一日说，如果美国真正建议在日本储存原子弹或氢弹时，日本有权拒绝任何这种美国的建议。他指出，日本在采取这种行动时，既不受日美“行政协定”也不受日美“安全条约”的约束。
    重光强调说，“日本不要参加另一次战争，它自然反对任何把它变成原子基地的建议。”
    重光是在参议院预算委员会上答复左派社会党议员的质询时发表这些意见的。
    自从美国要扩大它在日本的主要空军基地的计划透露以来，日本公众日益担心美国企图把日本变成它的原子基地。
