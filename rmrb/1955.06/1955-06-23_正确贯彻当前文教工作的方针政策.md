The National Cultural and Educational Work Conference held from May 19 to June 10 is of great significance. Following the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, and based on the nation's general task during the transition period and the basic tasks outlined in the draft First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development, and also based on the achievements made in the past two years of cultural and educational work under the principle of "consolidation and rectification, focused development, improved quality, and steady progress," and the new requirements proposed by the current new situation, the conference determined the new guiding principle for cultural and educational work for the next period, which is to focus on improving quality, develop steadily with planning and emphasis, implement rational deployment in terms of regional distribution, and make overall arrangements for both public and private cultural and educational undertakings. Based on this guiding principle, the conference formulated a series of policies, revised the cultural and educational section of the draft First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development, and stipulated concrete measures for implementing these guiding principles and policies.

Why does the general guiding principle for cultural and educational work formulated at this conference emphasize improving quality? This is because the most common and fundamental shortcoming in current cultural and educational work is the excessively low quality, which fails to meet the requirements of national construction and the people. In particular, if higher education, which is responsible for cultivating talent for national construction, cannot guarantee a certain level of quality, it will violate the interests of China's socialist industrialization.

However, some comrades do not see it this way. In terms of the development direction of higher education, they believe that in a country like ours with a very insufficient technical force, the primary requirement for cultivating technical talent should be quantity, and only then can we talk about quality. The lack of technical force is certainly one of the basic difficulties in China's current industrial construction, but this is not just a matter of quantity, but also of quality. The needs for some technical personnel can and should be met through relatively short-term training. However, socialist industrialization requires universities and colleges to cultivate specialized personnel who are politically sound, professionally competent in mastering modern scientific and technological knowledge, and physically healthy, not just short-term training. As everyone knows, the 156 projects that the Soviet Union is helping China build as the center of China's industrial construction all use the most advanced technology and equipment. Without corresponding personnel with a certain level of technical expertise, these enterprises cannot start production. Therefore, if we do not pay attention to the conditions of universities and colleges, the quantity and quality of teachers, the source and quality of students, as well as teaching materials and equipment, and only unilaterally pursue quantity, we will not be able to achieve the goal of cultivating qualified personnel.

The way to cultivate a large number of technical talents needed for industrial construction should not only focus on universities and colleges, but also attach great importance to secondary vocational schools. There should be a correct ratio between senior and intermediate technical cadres, and a clear division of labor between higher and secondary vocational schools. Those who only see the low level of graduates from secondary vocational schools, but do not actively try to improve the quality of secondary vocational schools, and attempt to transfer a considerable part of the task of cultivating intermediate technical cadres to universities and colleges are wrong. Another very important path is spare-time education. Massively running formal spare-time schools from primary school to university to improve the cultural, scientific and technological level of the vast number of in-service cadres and workers, and gradually make them technical cadres, is an extremely important measure that must be resolutely implemented. In order to improve the quality of higher education, a series of measures decided by the conference, such as strict enrollment conditions, gradual changes in the academic system, and efforts to improve teaching, must be gradually implemented.

Improving quality is a common task for all cultural and educational undertakings, but there should be different requirements for different undertakings. In education, the basic link to improving quality at present is to improve teachers and revise teaching materials, and the most important of these is to improve teachers. Educational administrative leaders should immediately formulate feasible plans to raise the level of existing teachers to a certain necessary degree within a certain period of time, and effectively solve the problem of teaching materials. In terms of health work, the main effort at present should be to improve the political and ideological level of health administrative personnel and medical staff, improve their ideological style, eliminate medical malpractice, and effectively rectify grassroots health institutions and implement the Party Central Committee's policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine. In terms of cultural and artistic work, the main task is to effectively organize forces, promote literary and artistic creation, strengthen artistic practice, and better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. The improvement of the quality of literary and artistic creation should be based on popularization. To improve the quality of literary and artistic creation, we must pay attention to both ideology and artistry at the same time.

Improving quality does not mean that we can ignore the needs of quantity, but that quality and quantity, needs and possibilities should be correctly combined, that is, we should strive for quantity on the condition of ensuring a certain quality.

Improving quality should be gradually improved on the original basis. It is not right to demand too much or too hastily, divorced from reality; but it is also not right to have no minimum requirement. Precisely because the original foundation of various undertakings is different, the reasons for the low quality are different, and the objective conditions for the development of work are also very uneven, the specific requirements must also be different, and we cannot force uniformity. This requires cultural and educational leadership departments at all levels to not only have general appeals, but also to have specific guidance, to be good at cultivating key units and using typical experiences to guide and promote general work.

Under the requirement of improving the quality of cultural and educational work, a very important problem that must be properly solved is to further improve, enhance, and vigorously develop workers' and peasants' education. The Party and the People's Government have always given the greatest importance and care to workers' and peasants' education, and have done a lot of work in recent years. However, the facts prove that, in addition to ordinary schools absorbing as many children of workers and peasants as possible, the principle of focusing on spare-time study must be implemented in carrying out the education of workers' and peasants' cadres and the masses of workers and peasants. This is because the vast number of workers' and peasants' cadres and the masses of workers and peasants cannot be transferred in large numbers and insist on studying away from production for a long time, and on the other hand, because they have the possible conditions to complete a certain study plan through spare-time study. The form of spare-time study is not only suitable for general improvement of culture, but also can train a large number of qualified technical and management personnel. Therefore, the conference decided that in the future, we must vigorously develop formal spare-time workers' and peasants' education—from primary school education to higher education. In order to do this work well, the production and construction departments and education departments must seriously solve the problems of teachers, teaching materials, funds, study time, and leadership. Although the existing workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools have achieved certain results in recent years, they are difficult to promote and generally cannot guarantee the necessary quality. Many students in accelerated secondary schools repeat grades or drop out because they cannot keep up with their studies, or because they are too tired from studying and damage their health; some students have barely entered universities and colleges, but most of their academic performance is not very good. Therefore, this conference decided that, in addition to appropriately extending the length of study for the existing students in workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools in order to improve the quality of learning as much as possible, enrollment will be suspended from this year onwards. In the future, the vast majority of workers' and peasants' cadres and the masses should conduct systematic spare-time study, and those who are willing to study away from production and are able to study away from production can enter ordinary schools after passing the examination. Those with the conditions of existing workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools can run workers' and peasants' cadre classes to absorb workers' and peasants' cadres (especially industrial cadres) to improve their cultural and scientific level. Doing so is to orient our plan for training workers' and peasants' cadres to the vast number of workers' and peasants' cadres and the masses, which is a more active and more effective method.

The guiding principles of rational deployment and overall arrangement decided by the conference are also timely.

The cultural and educational undertakings in old China were abnormally concentrated in coastal cities; although attention has been paid to gradually developing cultural and educational undertakings in the inland since liberation, the overall planning is not enough. In the future, the development and distribution of national cultural and educational undertakings must be re-deployed in accordance with the national economic, especially the industrial, development and distribution plan. The development speed of culture in the northwest, southwest, general ethnic minority areas, and old liberated areas should be increased in a planned manner. Areas with relatively developed culture should regard supporting areas with underdeveloped culture as their important political task. However, rational deployment mainly requires that future development should be carried out according to a relatively rational plan, and only a few very necessary units need to be moved from coastal cities to inland areas, and it is not necessary to move or adjust on a large scale. In the future, the development speed of cultural and educational undertakings in the inland areas should also be based on actually possible conditions. It is also inappropriate to develop too quickly, divorced from the original foundation of the local area.

In order to give full play to the enthusiasm of industrial and mining enterprises, the people, and private individuals in running cultural and educational undertakings, cultural and educational work must implement the principle of overall arrangement, gradually incorporate these undertakings into the plan, and actively lead them. We must see the growing cultural demands of industrial and mining enterprises and urban and rural workers and peasants, and the great potential for running various grassroots cultural and educational undertakings. At a time when our country is fully engaged in economic construction and cannot spend more financial and human resources to run general grassroots cultural and educational undertakings, how to give full play to the strength of all public and private parties to run some undertakings urgently needed by the masses is of great significance. For cultural and educational undertakings run by private individuals, those that meet the needs of national construction and the requirements of the masses should actively play their role under the condition of strengthening management. It should be recognized that the idea of ​​trying to contract all grassroots cultural and educational undertakings to the government now is not feasible. At present, the main ideological obstacles to the development of non-governmental cultural and educational undertakings are fear of trouble, fear of increasing the burden on the masses, fear of "unfairness," and emphasis on "standardization," etc.; in fact, these ideas are divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. As long as these undertakings are urgently needed by the masses, voluntarily run by the masses, and have the conditions to run, the masses will not only not feel that it is an extra burden, but will feel that it is of great benefit to them and solves many difficulties for them.

With the correct guiding principles and policies, the question now is to implement them accurately. Under the leadership of the local Party committees and people's committees, the local cultural and educational administrative departments should quickly formulate specific plans and gradually implement them based on the above-mentioned guiding principles and policies and in combination with the specific conditions of the local area.

### 正确贯彻当前文教工作的方针政策

    正确贯彻当前文教工作的方针政策
    从五月十九日至六月十日举行的全国文化教育工作会议，是有重要意义的。这次会议依照中共中央和国务院的指示，根据国家在过渡时期的总任务和发展国民经济第一个五年计划草案中所规定的基本任务，根据文教工作过去两年中在“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的方针下所取得的成绩和当前新情况所提出的新要求，确定了今后一个时期内文化教育工作的新方针，即以提高质量为重点，有计划有重点地稳步发展，在地区分布上实行合理部署，对公私文教事业加以统筹安排。会议并根据这一方针，制定了一系列的政策，又根据这些方针和政策修订了发展国民经济第一个五年计划草案中的文教事业部分，规定了实现这些方针政策的具体措施。
    为什么这次会议所制定的文教工作总方针中，要以提高质量为重点？这是因为当前文教工作中存在的一个最普遍最基本的缺点是质量过低，不能适应国家建设和人民群众的要求，尤其是为国家培养建设人材的高等教育事业，如不能保证一定的质量，就将违反我国社会主义工业化事业的利益。
    但是，有些同志并不是这样看的。在高等教育的发展方针上，他们认为，在我们这样一个技术力量十分不足的国家，培养技术人材，应首先要求数量，然后才能谈得到质量。技术力量不足，当然是我国目前工业建设中基本困难之一，但这不仅是数量问题，同时也是质量问题。有些技术人材的要求是可以而且应当用比较短期的训练来解决的。但社会主义工业化事业要求于高等学校的却不是这种短期训练，而是要求培养出政治上健全、业务上确实相当能掌握现代科学技术知识和身体健康的专门人材。大家都知道：作为我国工业建设中心的苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六个项目，都是采用最先进的技术装备，没有与之相应的有一定技术水平的人材，这些企业就不能进行生产。因此，如果不注意高等学校的条件，师资的数量和质量，学生的来源和质量，以及教材、教学设备等，而只片面追求数量，就不能达到培养合格人材的目的。
    培养工业建设所需要的大量技术人才的办法不能只看到高等学校这一条路，还应当十分重视中等专业学校。在高级和中级技术干部之间应有正确的比例，高等和中等专业学校之间应有明确的分工。那些只看到目前中等专业学校毕业生水平低，但又不积极设法提高中等专业学校的质量，而企图把相当一部分培养中级技术干部的任务转加到高等学校身上的做法，是错误的。另外一条非常重要的道路，就是业余教育。大量举办从小学到大学的正规的业余学校，以提高广大在职干部和工人的文化科学技术水平，使之逐步成为技术干部，是一项极为重要的措施，必须坚决加以贯彻。为了提高高等教育的质量，会议所决定的一系列的措施，如严格招生条件、逐步改变学制、努力改进教学等方面，都必须逐步实行。
    提高质量是一切文教事业的共同的任务，但对不同事业应有不同的要求。在教育方面目前提高质量的基本环节是提高师资和修订教材，而其中最主要的又是提高师资。教育行政领导部门应即制定切实可行的计划，在一定期限内提高现有师资水平到一定必要的程度，并切实解决教材问题。卫生工作方面目前主要应努力提高卫生行政人员和医务工作人员的政治思想水平，改进思想作风，消灭医疗上的责任事故，并切实整顿基层卫生机构，贯彻党中央关于团结中西医的政策。文化艺术工作方面，主要是切实组织力量，繁荣文艺创作，加强艺术实践，更好地为工农兵服务。而文艺创作质量的提高，应在普及基础上提高。对提高文艺创作质量，又必须同时注意思想性和艺术性。
    提高质量并不是说就可以忽视数量方面的需要，而是要使质量和数量、需要和可能正确地结合起来，就是说应当在保证一定质量的条件下努力争取数量。
    提高质量应在原有基础上逐步提高。离开现实条件，要求过高过急，是不对的；但没有一个最低限度的要求，也是不对的。正因为各项事业原有基础不同，造成质量低的原因不同，而工作发展的客观条件也很不平衡，在具体要求上也就必须有所不同，不能强求一律。这就要求各级文教领导部门不仅有一般号召，而必须有具体指导，要善于培养重点单位和运用典型经验来指导和推动一般工作。
    在提高文教工作质量的要求下，一个很重要的必须妥善解决的问题，就是进一步改进、提高和大力发展工农教育。对于工农教育，党和人民政府一向都给予最大的重视和关怀，几年来做了很多工作。但事实证明，除普通学校应尽量吸收工农子女入学外，开展工农干部和工农群众的教育，必须贯彻以业余学习为主的方针。这一方面是因为广大工农干部和群众不可能大量抽调并坚持长期脱离生产的学习，另一方面是因为他们有经过业余学习完成一定学习计划的可能条件。业余学习的形式不仅适用于一般的提高文化，而且可以培养出大量的合格的技术人材和管理人材。因此会议确定今后必须大力发展正规的业余的工农教育——由小学教育一直到高等教育。为了做好这一工作，各生产建设部门和教育部门必须认真解决教员、教材、经费、学习时间和领导等问题。现有工农速成中学几年来虽已取得了一定的成绩，但是难于推广，也一般不能保证必要的质量。许多速成中学的学生因学业跟不上而留级退学，或因学习过分吃力而损害了身体健康；有一些学生虽勉强升入了高等学校，但大多数的学习成绩并不很好。因此，这次会议决定工农速成中学除了现有在校学生应适当延长学习年限，以尽可能提高学习质量外，从今年起停止招生。今后广大工农干部和群众绝大多数应当进行有系统的业余学习，部分愿意脱离生产学习而又可能脱离生产学习者，可经考试进入普通学校。现有工农速成中学有条件者，可举办工农干部班吸收工农干部（特别是工业干部）入学，以提高其文化科学水平。这样做，是要把我们培养工农干部的计划，面向全国广大工农干部和群众，是更加积极、更加有效的办法。
    会议所决定的合理部署和统筹安排的方针，也是切合时宜的。
    旧中国的文教事业畸形地集中在沿海城市；解放以来虽已注意逐步发展内地文教事业，但通盘筹划还不够。今后全国文教事业的发展和分布必须按照国民经济特别是工业的发展和分布计划作新的部署。西北、西南以及一般少数民族地区和老解放区的文化发展速度，应有计划地提高。文化比较发展的地区应当把支援文化不发展的地区作为自己重要的政治任务。但合理部署主要是要求今后的发展应按比较合理的计划进行，只有个别十分必要的单位才须由沿海城市迁至内地，并不是要大搬家或大调整。今后内地文化教育事业发展的速度，也要根据实际可能的条件，脱离了当地原有基础作过快的发展，也是不适当的。
    为了充分发挥工矿企业、人民群众和私人举办文教事业的积极性，文教工作必须贯彻统筹安排的方针，把这些事业逐步纳入计划，并积极加以领导。必须看到工矿企业和城乡工农群众日益增长的文化要求和举办各种基层文教事业的很大潜力。在我们的国家正全力进行经济建设，还不能拿出更多财力、人力来举办一般基层文教事业的时候，如何充分发挥公私各方面的力量来举办一些群众迫切需要的事业，是有重要意义的。对于私人举办的文教事业，凡合乎国家建设需要和群众要求的，应在加强管理的条件下，积极发挥其作用。应当认识那种现在就企图将一切基层文教事业都由政府包下来的想法是行不通的。目前发展民办文教事业的主要思想障碍是怕麻烦，怕增加群众负担，怕“不公平”，以及强调“正规化”等等；其实这些想法都是脱离群众脱离实际的。只要这些事业是为群众迫切需要、群众自愿举办而又有条件举办的，群众不但不觉得是额外负担，反而觉得对他们有很大好处，为他们解决了许多困难。
    有了正确的方针和政策，现在的问题就是加以确切的实施。各地文教行政部门应当在当地党委和人民委员会领导下，迅速根据上述方针政策，结合当地具体情况，拟定具体计划并逐步加以贯彻。
