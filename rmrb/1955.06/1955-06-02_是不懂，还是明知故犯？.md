Is it ignorance, or deliberate violation?
    Li Yan

    Here are a few examples:

    The Propaganda Section Branch of the Workers’ Department of the Broadcasting Bureau hasn’t held a single Party member meeting in the six months from August of last year to February of this year.

    The Ministry of Water Resources once had a branch committee member who, when working in the Equipment Department, was a branch committee member of the Equipment Department branch; after being transferred to the Hydrology Bureau, he became a branch committee member of the Hydrology Bureau branch; and after being transferred to the General Office, he became a branch committee member of the General Office branch. What's going on? All were designated by the Ministry of Water Resources General Branch.

    In the central organs, there was also an incident where a Party branch of an institution required all resolutions made by the Party member assembly to be reviewed and approved by the branch committee. Why? Their reason was: because the members of this branch committee were all Party cadres of the thirteenth grade or higher, possessing a higher level than ordinary Party members.

    From these three examples, it can be seen that democratic life is very lacking in certain grassroots Party organizations.

    The Party member assembly is the highest leading body of the branch, and the branch committee should be elected by the Party member assembly; the branch committee should regularly convene the Party member assembly to report on its work to all Party members. This is the foundation of inner-Party democracy. Isn't this clearly and plainly stipulated and elaborated in the Constitution of the Communist Party of China and in Comrade Liu Shaoqi's book "On the Party"? Why do phenomena directly violating the Party Constitution still occur in the Party branches of our high-level leading organs? It is possible that individual branch workers have not carefully read the Party Constitution and "On the Party," and understand very little about some basic principles of Party life, but not all branch workers who do not abide by the provisions of the Party Constitution are like this. Can it be that the comrades of the Propaganda Section Branch Committee of the Workers’ Department of the Broadcasting Bureau really don’t understand that it is wrong not to hold a Party member assembly for half a year? Can it be that the comrades of the General Branch Committee of the Ministry of Water Resources really don’t understand that branch committee members should be elected by the Party member assembly and not carry their branch committee member position with them when they are transferred to a new job, just like transferring Party membership? Can it be that those branch committees composed of Party cadres of the thirteenth grade or higher really don’t know that the highest leading body of the branch is the Party member assembly? The fundamental problem does not lie here, but in the fact that these comrades do not believe that the strength of the Party organization lies entirely in all Party members giving full play to their initiative and creativity, and contributing their wisdom and experience. Therefore, they are unwilling to fully promote inner-Party democracy; in their view, whether it is not holding a Party member assembly for half a year, or designating branch committee members instead of electing them, or allowing the branch committee to be above the Party member assembly, there is nothing wrong with this, and some are even justified!

    All Communist Party members, especially Party branch workers, if they really do not understand the basic principles of inner-Party life, should study diligently; if they do understand, then they should conscientiously abide by the basic principles of inner-Party life and must not continue to deliberately violate them!

    是不懂，还是明知故犯？
    黎言
    有这样几个例子：
    广播事业局工务处传音科支部，从去年八月到今年二月的半年之内，没有开过一次党员大会。
    水利部曾经有这样一个支部委员，他在器材处工作时，是器材处支部的支部委员，调水文局工作后，就成了水文局支部的支部委员，调到了办公厅，又成了办公厅支部的支部委员了。怎么回事呢？全是水利部总支指定的。
    中央机关中还发生过这样一件事，一个机关的党支部，凡是党员大会制定的决议，都要经过支部委员会审查批准，为什么呢？他们的理由是：因为这个支部委员会的委员们都是十三级以上的党员干部，比一般党员具有更高的水平。
    从这三个例子可以看出，某些党的基层组织中民主生活是很缺乏的。
    党员大会是支部的最高领导机关，支部委员会应该由党员大会来选举；支部委员会应该定期召开党员大会，向全体党员报告自己的工作，这是党内民主的基础。这在中国共产党党章中，在刘少奇同志的“论党”一书中，不是规定得和论述得清清楚楚明明白白吗？为什么在我们高级领导机关的党支部中还会发生直接违背党章的现象呢？有可能个别的支部工作者没有认真地阅读过党章和“论党”一书，对党的生活中的一些基本原则还懂得很少，但并不是所有不遵守党章规定的支部工作者都是如此。难道广播事业局工务处传音科支部委员会的同志们就根本不懂半年都不开一次党员大会是不应该的吗？难道水利部总支委员会的同志们就真的不明白支部委员应该由党员大会选举而不该像转党的关系一样，工作调到那里就把支部委员的职务也带到那里吗？难道那些由十三级以上党员干部组成的支部委员会就的确不知道支部的最高领导机关是党员大会吗？根本问题并不在这里，而在于这些同志不相信党组织之所以有力量全在于全体党员发挥自己的积极性和创造性，贡献出自己的智慧和经验。因此，他们不愿充分发扬党内民主；在他们看来，半年不开一次党员大会也好，不是选举而是指定支部委员也好，让支部委员会凌驾于党员大会之上也好，这都没有什么不对，有些甚至是理所应当！
    所有共产党员，特别是党的支部工作者，如果确实不懂党内生活的基本原则，就应该认真地学习；如果并不是不懂，那就应该认真地遵守党内生活的基本原则，不能再这样明知故犯了！
