Having read the three batches of "Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" published in the "People's Daily," I cannot suppress the anger in my heart. The measures we should take today are to thoroughly expose the crimes of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique and give them the punishment they deserve.

The ugly face of Hu Feng, the reactionary leader who donned the cloak of Marxism and hid in the revolutionary literary and art ranks, and his counter-revolutionary clique, has now been exposed before the people. They used what they thought were very clever means: on the surface, "wrapping insults in smiles" to shake hands with us; in secret, they used "whips wrapped in rubber around steel wires" to lash us, desperately promoting their bourgeois subjective idealism and undermining the literary and art cause led by our Party. Their frenzied attacks have reached an intolerable level. Since these three batches of materials were published, the crimes of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique have been known to all. Are these materials not enough to prove the premeditated, unrepentant, resolute anti-Party and anti-people crimes of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique?

The Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique has been lurking in East China for quite a long time, and the area of their influence is particularly wide. Hu Feng himself often stayed in Shanghai to personally instigate his counter-revolutionary activities. His assistants have been distributed in every corner, and some have even usurped the leading positions in the cultural undertakings of East China and Shanghai. In recent years, they have brought incalculable losses to our revolutionary literary and art cause. Because they negated national forms, our East China Opera Research Institute suffered many damages and obstructions in its actual work. I completely agree with all the facts accused by Comrade Yuan Xuefen; I also agree with all the measures in the resolution of the Joint Enlarged Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association. We must thoroughly liquidate the crimes of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique, eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the revolutionary literary and art camp, and give them the punishment they deserve.

    彻底消灭胡风反革命集团
    周信芳
    看了“人民日报”发表的三批“关于胡风反革命集团的材料”以后，我抑制不住心头的怒火。我们今天应该采取的措施，是彻底揭露胡风反革命集团的罪行，给以应有的惩处。
    披着马克思主义的外衣，潜藏在革命文艺队伍里的反动头目胡风及其反革命集团的丑恶面貌，今天在人民面前揭露出来了。他们运用着自以为非常巧妙的手段：表面上“用微笑包着侮蔑”来和我们握手；暗中却“用像皮包着钢丝的鞭子”来鞭打我们，竭力宣扬他们的资产阶级主观唯心论，破坏我们党领导的文艺事业。他们的疯狂进攻，已经达到令人难以容忍的程度。自从这三批材料发表以后，胡风反革命集团的罪行，已为人所共知。难道这些材料还不足以证明胡风及其反革命集团的处心积虑，至死不悟，坚决反党反人民的罪行么？
    胡风反革命集团潜伏在华东已经有相当长久的历史，散布羽翼的面积也特别广阔，胡风本人且经常留居上海亲自策动他的反革命活动。他的助手已经分布在各个角落里，有的甚至窃得了华东、上海文化事业的领导地位。这几年来，他们给我们革命文艺事业带来了无可估计的损失。由于他们否定了民族形式，首先使我们华东戏曲研究院在实际工作中遭受了许多破坏和阻挠。我完全同意袁雪芬同志所控诉的一切事实；我更同意中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议决议中的一切措施。我们必须彻底清算胡风及其反革命集团的罪恶，肃清潜伏在革命文艺阵营里的胡风反革命集团分子，并给以应得的惩处。
