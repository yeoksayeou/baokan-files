Three Issues to Note in Developing Fishery Production
Chen Zhao

Several million fishermen in our country rely on fishing for a living, and tens of millions of farmers regard fishing as an important part of their production. Aquatic products are an important non-staple food for urban and rural people in our country. At a time when our country's animal husbandry is still underdeveloped and the supply of meat and eggs is insufficient, increasing the production of aquatic products can greatly improve the situation where people's non-staple food is in short supply. Aquatic products also have a wide range of uses in industry, medicine, and other fields. Developing the aquatic products industry can also increase the export volume of aquatic products, earning industrial equipment for the country.

The current state of fishery production is that scattered individual fishermen still dominate, and the main fishery production tools are sailboats and manually operated nets. This situation makes it impossible to utilize the vast ocean fishing grounds and freshwater areas on a large scale, and the unit yield of fisheries is still very low. The fundamental task of socialist transformation of fisheries is to change the scattered handicraft fishery production into collectivized large-scale production using ships and modern nets. This is a goal that can only be achieved after a considerable period. At present, we must rely on existing conditions to actively explore the potential of fishery production to increase the output of aquatic products.

Our country has extremely rich aquatic resources. The vast ocean fishing grounds near the mainland of our country have suitable water temperatures, abundant bait, and a large reserve of various fish, shellfish, and seaweed. There are approximately 300 million mu of rivers and lakes in our country's interior, and artificial reservoirs are also increasing. These are excellent fishing grounds for freshwater fish farming. Fishermen in our country have accumulated rich production experience in their long-term fishing labor. With the development of industrial construction, fishery equipment is gradually improving. The objective conditions are favorable, and as long as we correctly implement the party and the state's various policies in fishery production and promptly solve the key problems in fishery production, tap the potential of production, it is entirely possible to achieve the task of increasing fishery production.

The main problems in current fishery production are: safe production, technological improvement, and protection of aquatic resources. The correct resolution of these three issues is directly related to the realization of the potential of fishery production and the completion of the task of increasing production.

Safe production is the primary concern for coastal fishermen in their production. Ocean storms are the biggest threat to small sailboats operating at sea. In past years, accidents involving deaths and shipwrecks caused by storms have occurred in coastal fishing areas. These types of accidents also occurred during the spring fishing season this year. One of the important reasons for the accidents is that the party and government leading organs and aquatic product departments in many areas have neglected the importance of safe production. They have opposed the completion of production tasks to safe production, and often neglected the deployment and inspection of safe production work. This apathetic ideology and bureaucratic work style that is indifferent to the lives and property of fishermen must be corrected.

Of course, ensuring safe fishery production when backward small sailboats still account for the majority is a very arduous and difficult task. However, many facts show that as long as all possible measures are taken, marine loss accidents can be greatly reduced or even avoided. In the past two years, the most serious and numerous accidents have not occurred during the typhoon season, but during the spring fishing season. This is mainly because people think that the typhoon season has not yet arrived during the spring fishing season, so they are ideologically paralyzed and do not make the necessary preparations. Once encountering a storm attack, they are unable to resist. The leading organs and aquatic product departments in fishing areas should use various methods to conduct safe production education for the vast fishermen, so that the vast fishermen gradually learn some meteorological knowledge and related nautical common sense, and break superstition and adventurous mentality. Before fishing boats go to sea, it is necessary to conduct a detailed inspection of the safety measures of the fishing boats; in the allocation of ships and labor, methods should be adopted such as large ships taking small ships, and experienced fishermen taking new fishermen. In order to support the safe production of fishermen, the state is successively adding storm warning stations, navigation marks, lighthouses, radio stations, and other equipment. The leading organs and aquatic product departments in fishing areas should conduct specific guidance and inspection on a regular basis, so that these facilities can fully play their role. In addition, mobilizing fishery production cooperatives and mutual aid groups with better economic conditions to purchase radios and carry radios out to sea to listen to weather forecasts from meteorological stations at any time is also an effective way to prevent disasters.

Fishery production technology is very complex. In order to give full play to the potential of fishery production, it is necessary to attach great importance to improving fishery production technology. In marine fisheries, we should rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations to promote operating methods that combine multiple fishing gear. Some fishery production cooperatives in Qinhuangdao City, Hebei Province, and Changshan Islands, Shandong Province, have adopted this method and have achieved high yields. Increasing operating time and the number of net casts while strengthening technical guidance and paying attention to safe production is also an effective way to increase production. In freshwater fisheries, the focus of technological improvement should be on improving fish farming methods and fishing tools, and strengthening fish disease prevention and control. Ai Xianggui, the head of the fish farming team of the Qunli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanshanyue Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, managed five mu of fish ponds. Due to proper feeding and appropriate bait, he produced more than 500 jin of fish per mu of water in half a year, exceeding the average unit yield of fish ponds in the county by more than ten times.

Strengthening the protection of aquatic resources and overcoming the phenomenon of only caring about fishing and not caring about breeding is an extremely important task in aquatic product work. Many staff members and fishermen in fishing areas and rural areas do not understand the importance of protecting aquatic resources, and think that "the fish in the big rivers and seas cannot be caught, so what is the use of protecting aquatic resources?" This view is wrong. Our country's aquatic resources are indeed very rich, but only under the conditions of rational utilization and regular protection can it become an inexhaustible source of wealth; if we adopt the method of "draining the pond to get all the fish," no matter how abundant the resources are, they will gradually become scarce. According to estimates by the Poyang Lake Aquatic Products Management Department, if 300,000 jin of parent fish are protected in Poyang Lake, calculated at the lowest survival rate of 1% after spawning, 200,000 dan of fish can be produced in one year. We should make this clear to the fishermen so that they can recognize the consistency of current interests and long-term interests, and consciously abide by the various regulations for protecting aquatic resources.

    发展渔业生产要注意的三个问题
    陈昭
    我国有几百万渔民依靠渔业为生，几千万农民把渔业作为重要的生产内容。水产品是我国城乡人民的重要副食品。在目前我国畜牧业还不发达、肉类和蛋品供应不足的情况下，更多地增产水产品，可以在很大程度上改善人民副食品供不应求的状况。水产品在工业、医药等方面也有广泛的用途。发展水产业还可以增加水产品的出口量，为国家换回工业设备。
    目前渔业生产的现状是：分散的个体渔民还占绝对优势，主要的渔业生产工具是帆船和手工操作的网具。这种情况使得广阔的海洋渔场和淡水面积都还不能大规模地加以利用，渔业的单位产量还很低。对渔业实行社会主义改造的根本任务，就是把分散的手工业生产的渔业改变为采用轮船和近代化网具的集体化的大生产。这是在相当长时期以后才能实现的目标。在目前，我们必须依靠现有的条件，积极发掘渔业生产的潜力，来增加水产品的产量。
    我国拥有极为丰富的水产资源。我国大陆附近的广大海洋渔场的水温适宜，饵料丰富，各种鱼类、海贝和海藻的蕴藏量很多。我国内地共约有三亿亩面积的江河湖泊，人造水库也越来越多了。这些都是养殖淡水鱼类的优良渔场。我国渔民在长期的渔业劳动中积累了丰富的生产经验。随着工业建设的发展，渔业的设备正在逐步改善。客观条件是优越的，只要正确地贯彻党和国家在渔业生产中的各项政策，及时解决渔业生产中的关键性问题，发掘生产潜力，实现渔业的增产任务是完全可能的。
    当前渔业生产的主要问题是：安全生产、技术改进和水产资源的保护。这三个问题的正确解决，直接关系渔业生产潜力的发挥和增产任务的完成。
    安全生产是沿海渔民生产上的第一件大事情。海上风暴是在海上作业的小型帆船最大的威胁。沿海渔区历年都曾发生风暴造成的人员死亡、船只毁碎的事故。今年春季渔汛期间，这种事故又曾发生。发生事故的重要原因之一是有不少地区的党政领导机关和水产部门忽视安全生产的重要性。他们把完成生产任务同安全生产对立起来，常常疏忽对安全生产工作的布置和检查。这种对渔民生命财产漠不关心的麻痹思想和官僚主义作风，必须纠正。
    当然，在落后的小型帆船还占大多数的情况下，要保障渔业安全生产，是一个十分艰巨困难的任务。但是，许多事实说明，只要采取一切可能的措施，就能大大减少以至避免海上的损失事故。近两年来，最严重和最多的事故并没有发生在台风季节，而是发生在春季渔汛季节。这主要是由于春汛期间，人们认为台风季节未到，因而思想麻痹，不作必要的准备，一旦遇到暴风袭击，便无力抗拒。渔区领导机关和水产部门应该运用各种方式向广大渔民进行安全生产的教育，使广大渔民逐渐学到一些气象知识和有关航海的常识，打破迷信和冒险心理。在渔船出海前，一定要对渔船的安全措施进行细致的检查；在船只和劳动力的配备上，应采取大船带小船、有经验的渔民带新渔民的办法。国家为了支援渔民安全生产，正陆续增设暴风警报站、航标、灯塔、收音站等设备。渔区的领导机关和水产部门应该经常进行具体的指导和检查，使这些设备充分发挥作用。此外，动员经济条件较好的渔业生产合作社和互助组购置收音机，携带收音机出海，随时收听气象台的预报，也是预防灾害的有效办法。
    渔业生产技术是很复杂的。为了发挥渔业生产中的潜力，必须十分重视提高渔业生产技术。在海洋渔业方面，应该依靠互助合作组织，推广多种渔具兼作业的作业方法。河北省秦皇岛市和山东省长山列岛的一些渔业生产合作社采用这种方法，都获得了很高的产量。在加强技术指导和注意安全生产的情况下，增加作业时间和下网次数，也是一个有效的增产办法。在淡水渔业方面，改进技术的重点应该是改进鱼类饲养方法和捕捞工具，并加强鱼病防治工作。湖北省浠水县南山岳乡群力农业生产合作社养鱼组组长艾祥贵经营五亩鱼塘，由于饲养得法，给饵适当，在半年期间每亩水面产鱼五百多斤，超出全县鱼塘平均单位产量十倍以上。
    加强水产资源的保护，克服只管捕捞，不管繁殖的现象，是水产工作中一项极为重要的任务。不少渔区和农村的工作人员和渔民不懂得保护水产资源的重要性，认为“大江大海里的鱼捞不完，保护水产资源做什么？”这种看法是错误的。我国的水产资源确实十分丰富，但是，只有在合理利用和经常保护的条件下，它才能成为取之不尽、用之不竭的富源；如果采取“竭泽而渔”的办法，不论多么富足资源，也会逐渐贫乏的。据鄱阳湖水产管理部门估算，如果在鄱阳湖里保护好三十万斤?亲鱼，按产卵后百分之一的最低成活率计算，一年即可增产二十万担鱼。我们应该把这个账给渔民算清楚，使他们认识目前利益和长远利益的一致性，自觉地遵守各项保护水产资源的规定。
