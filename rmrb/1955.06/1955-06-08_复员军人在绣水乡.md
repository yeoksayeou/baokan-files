Demobilized Soldiers in Embroidery River Township

　　Embroidery River Township in Jintang County, Sichuan Province, received a total of twenty-six demobilized soldiers from January to April this year. Due to the importance attached to this by the township Party branch, and the full play given to the role of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns have been properly resettled.

　　Now, all the staff and the masses in this township deeply feel that demobilized soldiers are indeed a backbone force. For example, after demobilized soldiers such as Liu Banchun joined the Su Xinshu group, they took the lead in going to the fields to produce during the day, and assisted the staff in publicizing the "three fix" policy for grain, revising the spring production increase plan, and actively looking for fertilizer sources at night, leading the group of forty households to accumulate more than 84,000 jin of various natural fertilizers in twenty days, solving the fertilizer shortage problem in spring plowing. In carrying out the work of the peasant night school literacy class, demobilized soldiers Chen Daosheng, Shen Xiangyun, Yi Shangpin and others, under the leadership and support of the township Party branch, opened nine literacy classes, with more than 450 people participating in the study. Every evening, the sound of reading from several night schools could be heard more than half a li away. Similar new atmospheres can be seen everywhere.

　　Before resettling the demobilized soldiers, the Embroidery River Township Party branch vigorously carried out publicity and education work among the staff and the masses in the township, turning the task of resettling demobilized soldiers into a conscious patriotic action of the staff and the masses. In the past, due to insufficient publicity and education work, coupled with some shortcomings of individual demobilized soldiers, in the early stage of this spring's resettlement work, a small number of mutual aid groups and agricultural producers' cooperatives in this township had one-sided views on demobilized soldiers, and some people refused to allow demobilized soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In response to the above situation, the Embroidery River Township Party branch promptly convened a meeting of Party branch and mutual aid cooperation representatives, and through recall, comparison, and gratitude education, focused on criticizing various erroneous understandings, and introduced and commended the typical example of the Happiness Agricultural Producers' Cooperative actively and enthusiastically resettling demobilized soldiers. After such publicity and education, the understanding of the staff was corrected, and Liao Xuekui, the director of the Red Flag Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, who originally had greater resistance, also actively publicized the important significance of resettling demobilized soldiers to the masses. After repeated and in-depth publicity and education from the inside to the outside, and from the staff to the masses, the situation has changed greatly. Therefore, since March, when demobilized soldiers returned to their hometowns, the staff not only warmly welcomed them, but also introduced the changes in their hometowns in recent years and the issues that should be paid attention to in production and work, and encouraged them to carry forward the glorious tradition and strive to be models. The peasant masses automatically helped the demobilized soldiers to build houses, and some even gave up their surplus houses, cleaned them, set up beds, prepared cooking stoves, and provided them to the demobilized soldiers for use, which made the production enthusiasm and political enthusiasm of the demobilized soldiers generally increase.

　　According to the experience of Embroidery River Township, after the demobilized soldiers return to their hometowns, they should be absorbed into mutual aid groups or agricultural producers' cooperatives as much as possible in accordance with the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. This can not only relieve their production difficulties and increase the strength of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, but also make the demobilized soldiers more at ease in production. When demobilized soldiers first return to their hometowns, they are generally very enthusiastic, but there are also individual ones who are not at ease with agricultural production. For example, demobilized soldier Gu Youcai was initially unwilling to engage in rural production, but after patient education by the township leaders, he initially agreed and requested to be placed in an agricultural producers' cooperative. The township staff actively contacted the Happiness Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, obtained their consent, and made some necessary preparations. When Gu Youcai arrived in the village, the cooperative members came out to welcome him from afar, serving tea and water, and also lent him a wooden bed, a pot, a bucket, and a kitchen knife, and welcomed him to join the cooperative. This made him very moved. He said repeatedly: "The agricultural cooperative is really my home!" Then he automatically took out 200 yuan of production assistance funds as an investment in the cooperative and said: "I will definitely abide by the laws of the country, obey the leadership of the cooperative, actively produce, and do a good job to repay the care of the Party and the people." After joining the cooperative, he performed very well. The cooperative director Li Yousan said: "This period is busy with harvesting, busy with planting, and also busy with 'three fix', it's really like marrying a daughter-in-law and marrying a daughter at the same time, both ends are tight, if it weren't for Comrade Lao Gu's help, it would be really unbearable." Due to realizing the active role of demobilized soldiers in production and work, the cooperative then absorbed two more demobilized soldiers into the cooperative. The staff in the cooperative also told the township and village staff: "If any comrades are demobilized and return in the future, we will welcome them just the same, and guarantee that we will do a good job in the resettlement work." At present, among the twenty-six demobilized soldiers in the whole township, five have joined mutual aid groups, and twenty-one have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives. Among them, four were elected as group leaders, and fourteen served as cooperative production team leaders or higher.

　　Since demobilized soldiers have been away from production for a long time, and some were gloriously wounded in battle, it is inevitable that they will encounter some difficulties when they return to their hometowns to produce. Especially the unmarried comrades, they are often busy with production outside the home, and cannot take care of housework inside the home. Others eat dinner, while they are still cooking lunch. Individual laborers with weaker strength are even more worried that their work points are low, affecting their income, and thus their emotions are not high. In response to this situation, Embroidery River Township promptly convened four demobilized soldiers' meetings, starting from summarizing and inspecting production, commending the good ones, appropriately criticizing individual poor performers, and through the study of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the demobilized soldiers further realized the development prospects of agriculture and their own obligations. On the issue of marriage, they also clearly realized that only by doing a good job in production can it be solved. After that, civil affairs cadre Hu Maoxiu, according to the instructions of the Party branch, contacted and studied with Happiness, Linjiang, Red Flag and other agricultural producers' cooperatives, designated special personnel to teach the demobilized soldiers production technology, and decided to take care of eleven demobilized soldiers who had been in the army for a long time and were physically weak, and assign them some lighter work in production. This solved the practical difficulties of their unfamiliarity with production and weak physical strength. After demobilized soldier Tang Hongfa returned to his hometown, he performed very well. In addition to welcoming him to join the cooperative, the Happiness Agricultural Producers' Cooperative also helped him get married. He was very happy and often said to people: "The Communist Party is even better than my parents, and the township and village cadres are like brothers. Without the Communist Party, I would never have thought of settling down in this life." He is even more energetic in production and work. Now, among the twenty-six people who have returned to their hometowns, in addition to the seventeen who were married before joining the army, three of the remaining nine unmarried people are about to get married.

    复员军人在绣水乡
    晚炬
    四川省金堂县绣水乡今年一月至四月共接收复员军人二十六名，由于这个乡党支部的重视，充分地发挥了互助合作组织的作用，因而回乡的复员军人都得到了妥善的安置。
    现在这个乡所有的工作人员和群众，都深深感觉到复员军人确是一批骨干力量。如复员军人刘伴春等参加了苏心恕联组后，白天带头下地生产，晚上协助工作人员宣传粮食“三定”政策，修订大春增产计划，又积极寻找肥源，带动全组四十户在二十天内积了各种自然肥料八万四千多斤，解决了春耕中的缺肥问题。在开展农民夜校识字班的工作中，复员军人陈道生、沈详云、易上品等八人在乡党支部领导和支持下，开办了九所识字班，参加学习的达四百五十多人。一到晚上，几所夜校的读书声，附近半里多路都能听见。类似的新的气象，到处都能看到。
    绣水乡在安置复员军人以前，党支部曾在乡的工作人员和群众中大力进行了宣传教育工作，把安置复员军人的任务变成为工作人员和群众的自觉爱国行动。以往由于宣传教育工作作得不够，加以个别复员军人有些缺点，因此在今春安置工作初期，这个乡有少数互助组和农业生产合作社的农民，对复员军人曾有片面的看法，有人拒绝复员军人参加互助合作组织。绣水乡党支部针对上述情况，及时召开了党支部和互助合作代表会议，通过回忆、对比、饮水思源的教育，着重批判了各种错误认识，介绍和表扬了幸福农业生产合作社积极热情安置复员军人的典型事例。这样宣传教育以后，工作人员的认识端正了，原来抵触情绪较大的红旗农业生产合作社主任廖学奎，也积极向群众宣传安置好复员军人的重要意义。经过由内到外，由工作人员到群众的反复深入的宣传教育，情况有了很大改变。因此，自三月份起，复员军人回乡时，工作人员除热情欢迎外，还介绍了家乡几年来的变化情况和生产、工作上应注意的问题，鼓励他们发扬光荣传统，争取当模范。农民群众自动帮助复员军人修建房屋，有的还把自己的多余房子让出来，打扫干净，搭好床铺，准备锅灶，供给复员军人使用，这就使复员军人的生产积极性和政治积极性普遍提高起来。
    根据绣水乡的经验，复员军人回乡后，应该按照自愿互利原则，尽量吸收他们加入互助组或农业生产合作社。这样不仅可以解除他们生产上的困难，增加互助合作组织的力量，而且也使复员军人更安心于生产。复员军人初回家乡时，一般热情都很高，但也有个别不安心农业生产的。如复员军人顾有才，起初很不愿到农村生产，经过乡的领导上耐心教育以后，他初步同意了，要求安置在农业生产合作社里。乡工作人员便同幸福农业生产合作社积极联系，取得同意，并做了一些必要的准备工作。顾有才到村时，社员老远就出来欢迎，送茶倒水，还借给木床一架，锅一口，水桶一挑，菜刀一把，又欢迎他入社。这使他非常感动，他接二连三地说：“农业社硬是我的家了！”接着他自动拿出生产资助金二百元作为入社投资，并表示：“一定遵守国家法令，服从社内领导，积极生产，做好工作来报答党和人民的关怀。”入社以后，他表现得很好。社主任李友三说：“这一时期又忙收，又忙种，还要搞‘三定’，真是又接媳妇又嫁女，两头紧火，要不是老顾同志帮助，真有些吃不消。”由于体会到复员军人在生产、工作中的积极作用，这个社接着又吸收了两个复员军人入社。社里的工作人员并且找乡、村工作人员说：“今后如有同志复员回来，我们一样欢迎，并保证把安置工作做好。”目前全乡二十六名复员军人中，已加入互助组的有五人，加入农业生产合作社的有二十一人。其中当选为组长的四人，担任社生产队长以上的工作人员的十四人。
    复员军人由于长期脱离生产，有些并在战斗中光荣负伤，回乡生产开始不免有些困难，特别是未婚的同志，他们往往忙了门外生产，就顾不了门内家务，别人吃晚饭，自己还在煮午饭，个别劳力弱的更担心工分低，影响收入，因而情绪不高。根据这种情况，绣水乡又及时召开了四次复员军人会议，从总结检查生产入手，表扬了好的，适当地批评了个别表现不好的，通过对农业实行社会主义改造的学习，使复员军人们进一步认识到农业的发展前途和自己应尽的义务；在婚姻问题上，也清楚地认识到只有搞好生产，才能得到解决。此后，民政干事胡茂修又根据党支部指示，同幸福、临江、红旗等农业生产合作社联系研究，指定专人教给复员军人生产技术，并确定对十一名参军较久，身体较弱的复员军人加以照顾，在生产上分给一些较轻的活。这样就解决了他们生产不熟练和体力弱的实际困难。复员军人唐洪发回乡后，表现很好，幸福农业生产合作社除欢迎他入社外，又帮助他结了婚。他非常高兴，常对人说：“共产党比父母还好，乡、村干部像亲兄弟一样，不是共产党，我这辈子休想安家。”他在生产和工作上更加起劲了。现在回乡的二十六人中，除参军前结婚的十七人外，其余没有结婚的九人中，有三个人快要结婚了。
