    A Long-Term Imprisoned Machine
    Li Zhiping
    The Hankou Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau (formerly the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau Basic Construction Company) installed a brick press in the Jiaozuo mining area in January of this year, but to this day, this new machine is still lying in the newly built factory building and has not been put into operation. Workers say: The brick press is in jail.
    This machine was purchased by the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau as early as the beginning of 1953. On the surface, adding this brick press is beneficial to the coal mine industrial construction in the Jiaozuo coal mine and nearby areas, and it can mechanize the production of the brick and tile factory under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau. However, according to last year's project task calculations, the bureau's annual brick requirement is only one-sixth of the brick press's equipment capacity. This year's brick requirement is only one-twelfth of the brick press's equipment capacity. This means that after the brick press is put into production, most of its capacity will not be utilized.
    The factory site is located near the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau Hospital, and the soil for brick making can be used for eight or nine years. However, this location has been planned as a construction area by the local government. After the brick press is put into production, either the urban plan will be changed, the factory site will be relocated, or the soil will be taken from a distant place. Soil is the most important raw material for brick making. If the soil is taken from a relatively distant place, the product cost will inevitably increase.
    The factory building is built as a temporary building with a lifespan of only two or three years, but the base of the brick press is made of concrete according to a permanent building. Originally, only sleepers were needed for the base, because the soil in the area where the brick and tile factory is located cannot be completely exhausted year after year. After the soil is exhausted, the factory will be relocated, and the concrete structure of the machine base cannot be moved.
    This brick press has been purchased for two years. It was not carefully inspected when it was purchased, and it was only discovered during installation that some parts were missing. In addition, the equipment capacity cannot be utilized and the cost is high, so it cannot be operated for a long time after installation, resulting in a backlog of more than 81,900 yuan of state funds. If it is to be put into production, it is necessary to add a set of electric chutes, light railways, rain-proof equipment, etc. In addition, calculated on the basis of eight hours of operation per day, it is necessary to build twenty new brick kilns and equip eighty workers. That is to say, the state will have to spend another 30,000 to 50,000 yuan to make this machine run. Because the state does not need to spend more money for a machine that cannot exert its equipment capacity, this brick press has to be imprisoned for a long time.
    What is strange is that the person in charge of the planning department of the Hankou Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau is so keen on this kind of blind construction. When compiling this year's plan, he excitedly proposed: "Let's buy another tile press!" Fortunately, this plan was stopped by people; otherwise, the brick press squatting in prison could have one more partner.

    一部长期被禁闭的机器
    黎稚萍
    汉口煤矿基本建设局（原焦作矿务局基本建设公司）今年一月在焦作矿区安装了一部压砖机，但直到今天这部新机器还躺在新建的厂房里面没有运转过。工人们说：压砖机坐监牢了。
    这部机器远在一九五三年初就由焦作矿务局买来了。从表面来看，添置这部压砖机对于焦作煤矿和附近地区的煤矿工业建设是有好处的，而且可以使焦作矿务局所属砖瓦厂的生产走向机械化。但是，按照去年的工程任务计算，这个局一年所需要的用砖数量仅及这部压砖机设备能力的六分之一。今年需要的砖仅及压砖机设备能力的十二分之一。这就是说，这部压砖机投入生产后，大部分能力将不能发挥。
    这座工厂的厂址选择在邻近焦作矿务局医院的地方，制砖的土可供八、九年使用。但是这个地点已为当地政府规划为建筑区域，压砖机投入生产后，或者是改变城市规划，或者是迁移厂址，再不然就是到远地去取土。而土是制砖的最主要原料，如果到较远的地方去取土，产品成本必然要增高。
    这座工厂的厂房是按临时性建筑修建的，寿命只有两、三年，但压砖机的底座却是按永久性建筑，用混凝土做的。本来只要用枕木做底座就行了，因为砖瓦厂所在地区的土不是常年累月取不完的，土取完后，工厂就要搬家，而混凝土结构的机器底座是搬不动的。
    这部压砖机买来两年了，在买的时候检查不仔细，安装的时候才发现缺少部分零件。再加上设备能力不能发挥，成本高，因而装好后长期不能运转，积压了国家资金八万一千九百多元。如果要使它投入生产，还得增加一套电溜子，轻便铁道，防雨设备等来配合。除此以外，按每天开动八小时计算，还得新建二十个砖窟，配备八十名工人。也就是说，国家还要拿出三万至五万元的资金，才能使这部机器转动起来。因为国家没有必要为一个不能发挥设备能力的机器花费更多的钱，这部压砖机只好长期坐监牢了。
    奇怪的是，汉口煤矿基本建设局计划处的负责人员竟醉心于这种盲目的建设。在编制今年计划的时候，他又兴致勃勃地提出：“再买一部压瓦机吧！”幸而这个计划被人们制止了；不然，蹲在监牢里的压砖机又可增加一个伙伴。
