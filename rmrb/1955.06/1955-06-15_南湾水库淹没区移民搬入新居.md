Over 17,000 immigrants from the Nanwan Reservoir flooded area in the upper reaches of the Huai River have moved into more than 16,000 new houses built for them by the People's Government in Xinyang, Luoshan, and other places. During the relocation, the People's Government transferred a large number of trucks and handcarts from Anyang, Xinxiang, and other places, and also transferred a batch of bamboo rafts to support them. After moving into their new homes, they received a warm welcome and assistance from the local residents. When the immigrants who moved to the tenth district of Luoshan didn't have rice seedlings for transplanting, the local residents helped them through mutual aid and borrowing. In four townships, more than 1,600 jin of rice seeds were lent to the immigrants. In addition, local residents in Xinyang and Luoshan counties also repaired 876 ponds and weirs for them within the land designated for the immigrants to cultivate. The Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Xinyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office also sent a group of cadres with a large number of letters of condolence and relief funds of 2,800 yuan to the immigrant areas and townships to express their sympathy and provide relief. After arriving in their new homes, the immigrants actively engaged in production. Immigrants in Cailou Township, the ninth district of Luoshan, have already carried over 4,000 dan of pond mud and planted over 5,000 trees on their homesteads.

    南湾水库淹没区移民搬入新居
    淮河上游的南湾水库淹没区有一万七千多移民，已分别搬进人民政府在信阳、罗山等地给他们盖的一万六千多间新房。在搬家时，人民政府曾从安阳、新乡等地调来大批汽车、架子车，还调了一批竹排，支援他们；搬进新居后，又受到了当地居民亲切地欢迎和帮助。迁到罗山十区去的移民没稻谷下秧，当地居民就用互助互借的办法帮助他们，在四个乡中，借给移民的稻种就有一千六百多斤。此外，信阳、罗山两县当地居民，还在指定给移民耕种的土地内，为他们整修塘堰八百七十六口。中共信阳地委、信阳专署还派出一批干部，携带大批慰问信和救济款二千八百元，分别到各移民区乡进行了慰问和救济。移民到达新居后，都积极进行生产。罗山九区蔡楼乡移民已经担塘泥四千多担，在自己的宅地上栽树五千多棵。
