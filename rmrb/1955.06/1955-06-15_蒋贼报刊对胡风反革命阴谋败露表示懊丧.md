Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: The reactionary special agent newspapers published in Taiwan and Hong Kong were greatly dismayed by the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and declared that they would draw experience and lessons from the activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

    Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "Central Daily News," in a recent commentary, continued to describe the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng as a "daring and outspoken" person, and praised the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's vicious "tactics" of using "cluster hand grenades" and "whips wrapped in rubber-coated steel wires." This Chiang Kai-shek bandit's central organ newspaper also reviewed the "error" of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique as launching an offensive in an "inopportune" situation.

    In the special agent magazine "Free Front," published on June 6th, an article by a special agent named "Qingping" openly called on all counter-revolutionary elements who are enemies of the Chinese people to learn from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and draw experience and lessons from the activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. This special agent said: "Although Hu Feng has failed, the significance of this matter is very serious. It tells us that anti-communism must be directed at these five knives, starting with opposing the interference of the Party (note: namely the Chinese Communist Party) or the State (note: namely the People's Republic of China), otherwise it will be a shot in the dark." This special agent also analyzed in detail the reasons for the failure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and said that Hu Feng was "worthy of praise," but "a profound review" of the failure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique "cannot but be carried out."

    蒋贼报刊对胡风反革命阴谋败露表示懊丧
    新华社十四日讯　台湾、香港出版的反动特务报刊，因为胡风反革命集团的被揭露，大为懊丧，并宣称要从胡风反革命集团活动中吸取经验教训。
    蒋贼“中央日报”在最近发表的一篇评述中，除继续把反革命分子胡风形容为“敢说敢作”的人，并且对胡风反革命集团分子使用“集束手榴弹的战术”“橡皮包着钢丝的鞭子”的恶毒“战法”，表示赞赏外，这家蒋贼中央机关报还检讨胡风反革命集团的“错误”是，在“不合时宜”的情况下发动进攻。
    六月六日出版的特务杂志“自由阵线”上，发表了一个署名“清平”的特务分子的文章，公开号召一切与中国人民为敌的反革命分子，要向胡风反革命集团学习，并从胡风反革命集团活动中吸取经验教训。这个特务分子说：“胡风虽然失败了，但是这件事所表示的意义是十分严重的。它告诉了我们：反共必须针对这五把刀子来反，从反对党（按：即中国共产党）或国家（按：即中华人民共和国）干涉开始，否则就是无的放矢。”这个特务分子，还在文章中详细地分析了胡风反革命集团失败的原因，并说胡风是“值得赞扬的”，但是对胡风反革命集团的失败却“不能不予以深刻的检讨”。
