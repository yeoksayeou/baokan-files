Various Places Train Technicians for the First Automobile Factory

    Recently, on passenger trains arriving in Changchun from various places, batches of young men and women workers have been stepping off, happily heading to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. These are batches of workers whom the automobile factory entrusted to enterprise departments in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Shenyang, Dalian, and other places to help cultivate and train.
    A year ago, they were still demobilized soldiers, rural youths, and junior and senior primary school graduates who did not understand industrial production technology. Currently, more than nine hundred workers in over fifty trades, such as lathe operators, milling machine operators, electricians, and heat treatment workers, have returned to the factory. After skill testing, ninety percent have reached technical levels of Grade 3 or higher.
    Leaders and workers in relevant factories in various places have attached great importance to the work of training workers for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Factories generally formulated detailed training plans and selected technical personnel to serve as full-time instructors to teach technical theory. Fu Huicai, a planer operator at the Shanghai Xinzhong Power Machinery Factory, took the initiative to request to train apprentices. He not only patiently taught the apprentices about planing technology but also taught them about the fitter work he knew. Some factories also adopted the method of cyclical learning, allowing apprentices to practice operating on various machine tools to master the performance of various machine tools. All of the more than one hundred and forty apprentices trained by the Dalian Shipbuilding Company reached Grade 2, and more than fifty of them reached Grade 3.

    各地为第一汽车厂培养技工
    最近，从各地到达长春的旅客列车上，不断地走下一批一批的青年男女工人，愉快地奔向第一汽车制造厂。这是汽车厂委托北京、天津、上海、南京、汉口、沈阳、大连等地的企业部门帮助培养训练的一批工人。
    一年以前，他们还是一些不懂工业生产技术的转业军人、农村青年和初中、高小的毕业生。目前，已经回厂的车工、铣工、电工、热处理等五十多个工种的九百多名工人，经过考工，百分之九十都达到了三级工以上的技术水平。
    各地有关工厂的领导人员和工人对于为第一汽车制造厂训练工人的工作都很重视。各厂普遍制定了周密的培养训练计划，并抽调技术人员担任专职教员，讲授技术理论。上海新中动力机厂刨工傅胡才主动请求培养徒工。他不但耐心地教给徒工关于刨工的技术，还把自己知道的钳工活也教给徒工。有些工厂还采取循环学习的办法，使徒工到各种车床上练习操作，掌握各种车床性能。大连造船公司训练的一百四十多名徒工全部达到二级工，其中有五十多名达到三级工。
