    Chongqing Joint State-Private China Wool Textile Factory has successfully trial-produced high-grade wool fabrics such as serge, melton, and tweed using domestically produced wool.
    In the past, various high-quality wool fabrics produced by wool textile factories in our country were all woven using imported wool. The domestically produced wool, with very little fine wool, could only be used to weave some coarse wool fabrics. In 1954, the China Wool Textile Factory learned that Kazakh herdsmen in the Yining and Tacheng areas of Xinjiang had improved their sheep breeds and were producing a kind of "Lanha" wool with long fibers and a high degree of fineness, so they sent special personnel to purchase it for trial production.
    The trial production work began in the factory in March of this year. During the trial production, difficulties were encountered due to the high oil content of the wool, making it difficult to spin and dye. However, the workers were determined to make the trial production of high-grade wool fabrics with domestic wool a success. The factory's Party organization and administration organized engineering and technical personnel and veteran workers to jointly study and gradually grasp the properties and characteristics of the wool. After repeated trial spinning and dyeing, the trial production was completely successful on May 8th, after more than thirty days. Currently, the factory is producing in large quantities.

    重庆公私合营中国毛纺织厂用国产羊毛制成高级毛织品
    重庆公私合营中国毛纺织厂采用我国自产羊毛，试制哔叽、海立蒙、平厚呢等高级毛织品成功。
    我国各毛纺织厂所生产的品质较高的各种毛织品，过去都是采用国外进口羊毛织造；国内所产羊毛，其中细羊毛很少，只能织一些粗糙的毛织品。一九五四年，中国毛纺织厂了解到新疆的伊宁、塔城一带哈萨克族牧民们改良了羊种，生产了一种纤维长、细度大的蓝哈羊毛，就派专人采购回来试制。
    今年三月，厂里开始了试制工作。在试制中碰到了羊毛含油脂多、不好纺和不容易上颜色的困难，但职工们都决心要使国产羊毛试制高级毛织品成功。厂里党组织和行政组织了工程技术人员、老工人共同研究，逐渐掌握了羊毛的性质和特点，经过反复试纺、试染，前后历时三十多天，到五月八日完全试制成功。目前这个厂正在大批地织造。
