Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th. Following their assistance on May 9th to American imperialist elements in forcibly occupying the warehouse of the China Aviation Corporation (formerly known as Bailey Dockyard), the Hong Kong British authorities on June 1st again forcibly occupied the warehouse of the China National Aviation Corporation located at the original Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory on Kowloon City Road, Hong Kong. American imperialist element Claire Chennault, with the assistance of the Hong Kong British authorities, once again seized the property of our two aviation companies in Hong Kong.

At 10:00 AM on June 1st, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched more than 200 armed police officers to forcibly occupy the warehouse premises of the China National Aviation Corporation's original Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory. They used force to threaten all the employees of China National Aviation Corporation who were steadfastly protecting national property to withdraw. Our employees immediately stated that this was the national property of the People's Republic of China, and all our employees were staff members of state organs. The Hong Kong British authorities' occupation of our national property and coercion of our employees to withdraw was clearly unreasonable and was refused. However, the British police officer in charge insisted that our employees withdraw. At 6:00 PM that day, after lodging a serious protest with the British police officer in charge, pointing out that the Hong Kong British authorities should bear all responsibility and consequences for this illegal act, our employees solemnly held a ceremony of lowering the national flag to the sound of the national anthem, and then withdrew. It is understood that the Hong Kong British authorities subsequently handed over the aforementioned warehouse premises and affiliated assets to the American Siber Hegner Company, which was instructed by the American imperialist element Claire Chennault, for "takeover." This American Siber Hegner Company is the same company that, with the assistance of the Hong Kong British authorities, seized the warehouse of the China Aviation Corporation (formerly known as Bailey Dockyard) on May 9th.

Sources here point out that American imperialist elements have long been plotting to seize the property of our two aviation companies remaining in Hong Kong, and the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities have repeatedly violated our sacred sovereignty for several years, assisting American imperialist elements in achieving their despicable goal of seizing our national property. This kind of illegal and unfriendly behavior towards the Chinese people cannot but arouse the indignation and dissatisfaction of the Chinese people.

    香港英国当局协助美帝国主义分子
    再次劫夺我国中央航空公司在香港的财产
    新华社广州十六日电　香港英国当局继五月九日协助美帝国主义分子强行侵占我中国航空公司仓库（原名庇利船厂）以后，又在六月一日再次强行侵占我中央航空公司在香港九龙城道原新亚药厂的仓库。美帝国主义分子陈纳德在香港英国当局的协助下，又一次劫夺了我两航空公司在香港的财产。
    六月一日上午十时，香港英国当局出动武装警察二百余人，强行侵占了中央航空公司原新亚药厂的仓库房屋，并以武力威胁我中央航空公司坚守岗位保护国家财产的全体员工退出。我方员工当即声明这是中华人民共和国的国家财产，我全体员工都是国家机构工作人员，香港英国当局侵占我国家财产，强迫我员工退出显属无理，乃予拒绝。但英方警察负责人坚持要我方员工退出。当日下午六时，在向英方警察负责人提出严重抗议、指出香港英国当局应对这一非法行为负担全部责任和后果后，我方员工庄严地在高唱国歌声中举行降下国旗的仪式，然后撤离。据悉，香港英国当局随后已将上述仓库房屋和附属资财交给受美帝国主义分子陈纳德指使的美商西伯勒公司“接管”。这一美商西伯勒公司就是在五月九日在香港英国当局协助下劫夺我中国航空公司仓库（原名庇利船厂）的同一家公司。
    此间人士指出，美帝国主义分子长期以来就策划劫夺我两航空公司留港财产，而英国政府和香港英国当局几年来竟一再侵犯我国神圣主权，协助美帝国主义分子达到其劫夺我国家财产的卑鄙目的。此种非法的和对中国人民不友好的行为，不能不引起中国人民的愤慨和不满。
