On the Sea Encirclement and Capture of Chiang Kai-shek's Troops

Before dawn on May 20th, a wooden boat belonging to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops sailed to the sea not far from Baitang Township, Sixth District, Haicheng County, Fujian Province. Four men got off the boat. Under cover of darkness, they secretly swam towards the shore. After a while, these four men, armed with American-made revolvers, climbed onto the beach of Baitang Township, attempting to carry out harassment and sabotage activities. As soon as they landed, they discovered that our coastal defense was very tight. These Chiang Kai-shek troops didn't dare to proceed and immediately jumped back into the sea to find their wooden boat. However, the wooden boat had already drifted away somewhere.

At dawn, these four Chiang Kai-shek troops were floating and swimming in the sea between Baitang Township and Xincuo Township. They encountered a merchant ship sailing from Shantou to Xiamen. The six crew members on the ship heard these four Chiang Kai-shek troops shouting for help and thought they were fishermen in distress. When the merchant ship approached these four Chiang Kai-shek troops, these Chiang Kai-shek troops threatened them with guns to climb aboard and forced the crew to take them to Dongding Island, which was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. The crew members knew they were Chiang Kai-shek's troops and picked up firewood and wooden sticks on the ship to beat them fiercely. Helmsman Zeng Lianghuan raised an axe and aimed at a Chiang Kai-shek soldier who was about to climb onto the ship, but the axe handle was too short and didn't hit him. The Chiang Kai-shek soldier then shot and injured Zeng Lianghuan.

The enemy was finally driven away. The crew members predicted that they couldn't run far in the sea, so they went ashore and reported to the local government. Guo Lianlu, Secretary of the Sixth District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Haicheng County, immediately notified the militia of coastal townships to go to the sea to encircle and capture them after learning about the situation. Based on the direction of the tide and the time, he deployed a encirclement circle in the sea near Zhenhai Township.

The militiamen cast a dragnet in the sea. Huang Nanshan, the Party Branch Secretary and militia instructor of Zhenhai Township, led six militiamen and sailed a boat from Zhenhai. With four oars moving together, the boat sailed quickly eastward. Half an hour later, Huang Jiuji, who was paddling the stern oar, spotted three black dots far away on the sea. Everyone rowed harder towards the black dots. As they got closer, Huang Nanshan was sure: this was the enemy they were looking for. He said to everyone: "Everyone must obey orders and not shoot randomly. We must capture them alive!" Huang Nanshan and everyone discussed how to capture the enemy and decided that except for Huang Nanshan, the other six people would hide in the cabin and act on orders.

Huang Nanshan stood up on the boat. The enemy could already be seen clearly. When these three Chiang Kai-shek troops saw Huang Nanshan, they cunningly said that they came from Dongding Island to find the People's Liberation Army. Huang Nanshan explained to them the People's Liberation Army's policy of treating prisoners kindly and asked them to hand over their guns. These three Chiang Kai-shek troops didn't say anything when they heard that they had to hand over their guns first. Huang Nanshan gave a command, and the militiamen lying on the bottom of the cabin stood up with their guns, aiming at the three enemies, and shouted: "Don't move!" These three Chiang Kai-shek troops were so frightened that they shouted: "Don't shoot, don't shoot..."

The three enemies were disarmed and captured on the boat as prisoners. Another Chiang Kai-shek troop was also captured by another militia team from Baitang Township.

These four Chiang Kai-shek troops were all reconnaissance soldiers from the 206th Regiment of the 19th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army on Jinmen Island. They were specially sent to the mainland to carry out harassment and sabotage. Their names are Li Guoguo, Chen Chuming, Chen Mingxing, and Zhou Mengwu. (Xinhua News Agency)

    海上围捕蒋贼军
    五月二十日拂晓前，在离福建省海澄县第六区白塘乡不远的海面上，驶来了一只蒋贼军的木船。船上下来了四个人。他们趁着夜色偷偷地向岸边游过来。一会儿，这四个人手握着美国造的左轮枪爬上了白塘乡的沙滩，企图进行骚扰破坏活动。他们刚一上岸，就发现我海防戒备非常严密。这些蒋贼军没敢继续前进，就立刻跳进海里去找他们的木船。可是那只木船却已不知道漂到哪里去了。
    黎明时，这四个蒋贼军在白塘乡到新厝乡之间的海面上浮水游泳着。他们碰到了从汕头开到厦门去的一艘商船。船上的六个船工听到这四个蒋贼军喊救命，以为是遇难的渔民。当商船驶近这四个蒋贼军的时候，这些蒋贼军就用枪威胁着要爬上船，并强迫船工要把他们送到蒋贼军盘踞的东碇岛去。船工们知道他们是蒋贼军，就拿起船上的木柴、木棍向他们猛打起来。舵工曾两唤举起斧头对准一个快要爬上船来的蒋贼军砍过去，可是斧头柄太短，没有砍着，这个蒋贼军就开枪把曾两唤打伤了。
    敌人终于被赶跑了。船工们预料他们在海里一定跑不远，就靠岸报告了当地政府。中共海澄县六区区委书记郭联炉知道这一情况后，立即通知沿海各乡的民兵下海围捕，并且根据潮水的流向和时间，在镇海乡附近的海面上，布置了一个围捕圈。
    民兵们在海上撒下了天罗地网。镇海乡的党支部书记、民兵指导员黄南山带着六个民兵，驾一条船从镇海出发了。四把桨一起一落，船飞快地向东驶去。半个钟头以后，划尾桨的黄九计发现远远的海面上有三个黑点。大家更加起劲地划着桨向黑点驶去。越划越近了，黄南山肯定：这就是要找的敌人。他对大家说：“大家要听指挥，不许乱开枪，一定要抓活的！”黄南山和大家研究了抓敌人的办法，决定除了黄南山以外，其他六个人都隐蔽在舱里，听命令行动。
    黄南山在船上站起来。已经能清楚地看见敌人了。这三个蒋贼军看见黄南山就狡猾地说，他们是从东碇岛来找解放军的。黄南山向他们讲解了人民解放军宽待俘虏的政策，要他们把枪交出来。这三个蒋贼军听见要先交枪，都不响了。黄南山一声口令，伏在舱底的民兵端着枪站了起来，枪口瞄住这三个敌人，喝一声：“不许动！”这三个蒋贼军吓得连忙高叫：“不要开枪，不要开枪……”。
    三个敌人被缴了械，抓上船来做了俘虏。另一个蒋贼军也被白塘乡的另一支民兵队抓住了。
    这四个蒋贼军都是金门岛上蒋贼军十九师二零六团的搜索兵，他们是专门被派到大陆上来进行骚扰和破坏的。他们的名字叫李郭国、陈初明、陈明兴和周梦武。（新华社）
