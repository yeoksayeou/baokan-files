Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 13th: The "Akahata" published an editorial on June 4th, welcoming the entry into force of the agreement between Chinese and Japanese fisheries organizations on fisheries in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, effective June 13th.

The editorial stated that the conclusion of this fisheries agreement is not only an encouraging event for the Japanese trawling industry in the relevant areas, which is currently in an extremely difficult situation, but also an encouraging event for the Japanese fish processing industry, fish export industry, and all those engaged in fisheries throughout the country.

The editorial described the serious damage done to Japanese fisheries by the United States. The United States has designated an area in the Japanese sea and fishing grounds, with a total area equal to the island of Kyushu, as a naval base and training ground, and has restricted Japanese fishing in many ways. The editorial pointed out that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are forcing Japanese fisheries to face a crisis of bankruptcy in an attempt to use the difficult situation of Japanese fisheries to drive Japanese fishermen to invade the territorial waters of the Soviet Union and China for armed fishing, trampling on fishing grounds, in order to create international disputes.

The editorial went on to say that, however, the overwhelming majority of Japanese fishermen oppose this U.S.-Japanese reactionary policy of provoking disputes and are willing to promote friendship and good relations with the Soviet Union and China, and to negotiate peacefully to conclude mutually agreed agreements. The agreement on fisheries in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea was concluded due to the sincere wishes and efforts of Japanese fishermen, and the boundless goodwill of the Chinese government and people. This is a valuable manifestation of the great friendship and amity between the people of Japan and China.

The editorial emphasized that the Japanese government must assume responsibility for resolving Sino-Japanese fisheries issues. The editorial also called on Japanese fishermen and the people of the whole country to strengthen unity, demand the removal of U.S. naval bases and training grounds that are endangering Japanese fisheries, restore Japanese coastal fishing grounds, abolish the unilaterally demarcated Clark-Rhee Line by the United States and South Korea, and strive to abolish the humiliating Japan-U.S.-Canada fisheries treaty. The editorial pointed out that only in this way can Japanese fisheries achieve independent and peaceful development.

    日本“赤旗报”发表社论
    评中日两国关于黄海东海渔业协定的生效
    新华社十三日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”曾在六月四日发表社论，欢迎中日两国渔业团体关于黄海东海渔业的协定自六月十三日起生效。
    社论说，这个渔业协定获得成立，不仅对于目前处境极端困苦的有关区域日本拖网渔业是一件欢欣鼓舞的事情，就是对于日本鱼品加工业、鱼品输出业和全国从事渔业的人来说，也是一件欢欣鼓舞的事情。
    社论叙述了美国对日本渔业的严重摧残。美国在日本海面和渔场划出总面积等于九州岛的海域充当海军基地和演习场，并且多方面地限制日本捕鱼。社论指出，美日反动派这样逼迫日本渔业，使之面临破产危机，是企图利用日本渔业的困难处境，驱使日本渔民侵入苏联和中国的领海去武装捕鱼，蹂躏渔场，借以制造国际争端。
    社论接着说，但是，占压倒多数的日本渔业者反对美日反动派这种企图挑起争端的方针，而愿意增进同苏联和中国之间的亲善和友好关系，和平协商以缔结双方同意的协定。关于黄海东海渔业的协定就是由于日本渔业者的这种衷心愿望和努力，以及中国政府和人民的无限好意而订立的。这是日中两国人民的伟大的友好和亲善的一个可贵的表现。
    社论强调日本政府必须对解决中日渔业问题承担责任。社论同时号召日本渔业者和全国人民加强团结，要求撤除使日本渔业面临危机的美国海军基地和演习场，恢复日本沿海渔场，取消美国和南朝鲜片面划定的克拉克—李承晚线，争取废除屈辱的日、美、加三国渔业条约。社论指出，只有这样，日本渔业才能获得自主的及和平的发展。
