    The Japanese people's struggle to ban atomic weapons has developed into a magnificent mass movement. More than a quarter of the country's population (over 23 million people), despite persecution, have signed petitions demanding a ban on atomic weapons. The resolutions passed by the Asian Countries Conference on the prohibition and supervision of weapons of mass destruction, and the call for all of Asia to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima to protest the use of atomic weapons, have greatly encouraged the Japanese people. Now, the Japanese people's call to oppose atomic war and demand the peaceful use of atomic energy is growing louder.
    Japan was the first country to suffer the disasters of atomic and hydrogen bombs, so the Japanese people's demand to oppose the use of atomic weapons is particularly strong. On August 6 and August 9, 1945, the United States, for ulterior motives unrelated to eliminating Japanese militarism, dropped its only two newly tested atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, causing the most barbaric massacre of peaceful residents in human history. For nearly ten years, the families of the hundreds of thousands of victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki have never ceased their grief. The continued deaths and long-term incurable suffering of many injured people weigh like dark clouds on the hearts of the Japanese people. Every year, the Japanese people, especially the residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, commemorate these two days with heavy hearts. Although the American occupation authorities brutally suppressed them, Japanese peace activists, progressive cultural and educational workers, and scientific and medical workers have widely voiced their demands for a ban on atomic weapons. Japanese painter Iri Maruki and Toshiko Akamatsu's "Atomic Bomb Disaster Pictures," and "Orphans Under the Atomic Bomb Disaster," compiled by Shin Nagata, chairman of the Japan Association for the Protection of Children, powerfully exposed the cruel atrocities of the American atomic maniacs. Seven million Japanese people signed the Stockholm Declaration of the World Peace Council, firmly advocating the prohibition of atomic weapons.
    In March 1954, the Japanese people suffered the disaster of atomic weapons for the third time. At that time, the United States tested a hydrogen bomb on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, injuring Japanese fishermen fishing in international waters. Moreover, the large amount of radiation emitted by the hydrogen bomb explosion threatened the safety of the Japanese people. After this incident, the Japanese people immediately launched a vigorous struggle throughout the country to protest the American hydrogen bomb test and demand a ban on atomic weapons.
    Over the past year, mass rallies demanding a ban on atomic weapons have been held in the vast majority of cities, towns, and villages across Japan. Many people's organizations, political parties, and religious organizations have issued statements or resolutions demanding a ban on atomic weapons. The assemblies of all 46 prefectures, Hokkaido, Osaka, and Kyoto, the assemblies of more than 250 cities, towns, and villages, the National Mayors Conference composed of mayors from more than 400 large and small cities across the country, and both houses of the National Diet have successively passed similar resolutions. Despite the multiple repressions of the former Yoshida government, which followed the United States, the signature campaign of the Japanese people demanding a ban on atomic weapons swept across the country like a storm. All strata of society, including people with various political views, participated in this movement. Among the persons in charge of the secretariat of the Japan National Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs are Tetsu Katayama, a former prime minister, Tokutaro Kitamura, a member of the Diet, as well as Hideki Yukawa, a famous physicist and Nobel Prize winner, and Ikuo Yasui, a professor at Hosei University. An 83-year-old man in Tokyo served as the chairman of the Shibuya Ward Council for the Signature Campaign to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and a teenager collected 70,000 signatures one after another. In 77 of the 80 districts in Kakegawa City, Shizuoka Prefecture, all residents signed; among the signatories in Koga City, Ibaraki Prefecture, were 200 members of the "Self-Defense Forces."
    At 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1954, the ninth anniversary of the atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima, the bells and sirens of Hiroshima City rang in unison to commemorate the victims of the bombing. 350,000 citizens bowed their heads and observed a moment of silence for the dead, expressing their determination to fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons. On September 23 last year, when the news of Aikichi Kuboyama's death from American hydrogen bomb injuries spread, 500 angry people immediately gathered in front of the hospital to hold a demonstration, shouting slogans such as "Yankees go home!" and "Ban atomic weapons!" On October 9, residents of Yaizu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, and 5,000 representatives from all over the country held a funeral ceremony for Aikichi Kuboyama, protesting against the atrocities of the United States. On this day, under the initiative of 38 trade union organizations including the National Railway Workers' Union, many factories, trains, and ships across the country sounded their sirens to mourn Aikichi Kuboyama, forming a large demonstration of the Japanese people against the American hydrogen bomb test and demanding a ban on atomic weapons. Aikichi Kuboyama's wife appealed to the Asian Legal Workers' Conference in January this year, saying: "I don't know why our fishermen were massacred by hydrogen bombs. I hate hydrogen bombs. I don't want anyone in the world to experience the same pain as I do. Please don't forget my husband's cry of 'Ban atomic weapons!' when he was dying, and please strive to maintain peace!" Obviously, any upright person cannot but sympathize with this just call.
    However, after the American atomic maniacs injured Japanese fishermen by testing hydrogen bombs, they not only continued to conduct hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific region, but also forced the victims to be handed over to the United States as materials for studying the effects of hydrogen bombs, under the pretext that the United States wanted to treat the injured. When this unreasonable demand was rejected by the Japanese people, the United States threatened Japan with the suspension of "aid" and falsely accused the Japanese fishermen who were injured by the hydrogen bomb as spies. Moreover, according to a report in the Japanese "Akahata" on April 14 this year, recently the United States even transported twenty young girls injured in the Hiroshima atomic bombing to New York by military aircraft, as "guinea pigs" for its research on the effects of atomic bombs. At the same time, the United States is intensifying its criminal activities of preparing for atomic war all over the world.
    In the practice of the struggle for the prohibition of atomic weapons, the Japanese people are increasingly aware of the serious disasters contained in the aggressive and war policies of the United States for Japan, and they also feel more deeply that they must get rid of the American occupation as soon as possible. Therefore, the Japanese people's struggle for the prohibition of atomic weapons has been combined with the struggle against the American occupation and against the American rearmament of Japan. With the development of the struggle for the prohibition of atomic weapons, the united front of the Japanese people's struggle for peace and national independence is rapidly growing and consolidating, and the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese people is rapidly rising. The Yoshida government, which has always yielded to the United States and supported the United States' hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific and used Japan as a tool for American aggression, finally collapsed under the strong pressure of the Japanese people.
    The Japanese people's struggle for the prohibition of atomic weapons is a just action to safeguard the safety of the Japanese people, and at the same time to safeguard world peace and human safety. It has won the sympathy and support of the people of all countries and many national government leaders. After the Japanese fishermen were victimized, calls for the cessation of hydrogen bomb tests spread all over the world. The appeal letter issued by the mayor of Hiroshima in 1954 demanding a ban on atomic weapons received reply letters of support from the mayors of many cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, Beijing, Warsaw, and Prague, representing the people of those cities. The Secretariat of the World Peace Council wrote to the Japanese people last year, expressing that the world peace forces fully support the just struggle of the Japanese people. The Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace expressed its firm support for the Japanese people's struggle to ban atomic weapons in a telegram to the "Japan National Convention for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" in January this year on behalf of the Chinese people.
    At present, the Japanese people are enthusiastically responding to the call of the "Letter to the People of the World" issued by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in January this year, and are more widely and deeply launching a signature campaign demanding a ban on atomic weapons, and are actively carrying out preparatory work in accordance with the resolution of the Asian Countries Conference to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. On May 10, the Japanese Preparatory Committee for the "World Convention Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" initiated by Japan held a meeting in Tokyo, and decided to hold the "World Convention Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" for four consecutive days in Hiroshima from August 6, the tenth anniversary of the American atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and hold the final meeting of the conference in Tokyo on August 15. The Japanese people, who are eagerly demanding peace, are working with the people of the world to push the struggle to stop atomic war and demand the peaceful use of atomic energy to a new climax.

    日本人民要求禁止原子武器的斗争
    蓝海
    日本人民要求禁止原子武器的斗争，已经发展成为规模壮阔的群众性运动。全国有四分之一以上的人口（二千三百多万人）不顾迫害，在要求禁止原子武器的呼吁书上签了名。亚洲国家会议通过的关于禁止和监督大规模毁灭性武器、要求全亚洲纪念广岛被炸十周年以抗议使用原子武器的决议，给了日本人民极大的鼓舞。现在，日本人民反对原子战争、要求和平利用原子能的呼声是越来越宏亮了。
    日本是首先遭受原子弹和氢弹灾害的国家，因而日本人民反对使用原子武器的要求也特别强烈。一九四五年八月六日和八月九日，美国为了同消灭日本军国主义毫不相干的不可告人的目的，把它刚刚试验成功的仅有的两颗原子弹投在日本的广岛和长崎，造成了人类史上对和平居民最野蛮的屠杀。近十年来，广岛、长崎的成千上万受害者的亲人，从来没有消失过悲痛。许多受伤者的继续死亡和长期不能痊愈的惨象，像乌云一样地压在日本人民心上。每年，日本人民、特别是广岛和长崎的居民，都以沉痛的心情纪念着这两个日子。虽然美国占领当局横暴地镇压，但日本和平运动人士、进步的文化和教育工作者、科学和医药工作者还是广泛地发出了要求禁止原子武器的呼声。日本画家丸木位里和赤松俊子的“原子弹灾难图”，日本保卫儿童会会长长田新编印的“原子弹灾难下的孤儿”，都有力地揭露了美国原子狂人的残酷暴行。有七百万日本人民，曾在世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，坚决主张禁止原子武器。
    一九五四年三月，日本人民第三次遭受了原子武器的灾害。当时，美国在太平洋比基尼岛试验氢弹，伤害了在公海捕鱼的日本渔民，而且由于氢弹爆炸而发出的大量放射能的影响，威胁着日本人民的安全。这次事件发生后，日本人民立即在全国如火如荼地展开了抗议美国试验氢弹、要求禁止原子武器的斗争。
    一年多来，日本全国绝大多数的都市、城镇和乡村，普遍举行了要求禁止原子武器的群众集会。许多人民团体、政党和宗教组织发表了声明或作出决议，要求禁止原子武器。日本全国的四十六个都、道、府、县的议会，二百五十多个市镇乡村的议会，全国四百多个大小城市市长组成的全国市长会议和国会参众二院，都先后通过了同样的决议。不顾追随美国的前吉田政府的多方镇压，日本人民要求禁止原子武器的签名运动像风暴一样地在全国各地展开。一切阶层、包括具有各种不同政治见解的人，都参加到这个运动中来了。日本禁止原子弹和氢弹运动全国协议会事务局的负责人中，有曾任首相的片山哲、国会议员北村德太郎，也有著名物理学家诺贝尔奖金得奖人汤川秀树、法政大学教授安井郁等人。东京一个八十三岁老人出任涩谷区要求禁止原子弹氢弹签名运动协议会的会长，一个少年先后征集了七万人的签名。静冈县挂川市的八十个区中，七十七个区的居民全部签了名；茨城县古河市的签名者队伍中，有二百名“自卫队”队员。
    一九五四年八月六日上午八时十五分，美国在广岛投下的原子弹爆炸九周年的时刻，为纪念在这次轰炸中的死难者，广岛市全市钟声和汽笛声齐鸣，三十五万市民低头为死者默念致哀，表示决心为禁止原子武器而斗争。去年九月二十三日，当遭受美国氢弹伤害的久保山爱吉的死讯传出后，五百名激怒的群众立即聚集到医院门前举行示威，高呼
  “美国佬滚回去！”“禁止原子武器！”等口号。在十月九日，静冈县烧津市居民和来自全国各地的代表五千人，举行了久保山爱吉的送葬仪式，对美国的暴行表示抗议。这一天，在国营铁道工会等三十八个工会组织的发起下，全国各地许多工场、火车和轮船齐鸣汽笛，对久保山爱吉表示哀悼，形成了日本人民反对美国试验氢弹、要求禁止原子武器的大示威。久保山爱吉的妻子，今年一月向亚洲法律工作者会议呼吁说：“我不知道我们渔民为什么要遭到氢弹残杀，我痛恨氢弹，我不愿意世界上任何人尝到和我同样的痛苦。请求你们不要忘记我丈夫临死时叫喊‘禁止原子武器！’的呼声，请求你们努力维护和平！”显然，任何正直的人，对这种正义的呼声都不能不表示同情。
    但是，美国原子狂人在试验氢弹伤害了日本渔民后，不但继续在太平洋地区进行氢弹试验，反而借口美国要治疗受伤者，强迫要把受害者交给美国去作为研究氢弹效果的材料。当这种无理要求为日本人民拒绝后，美国就用停止“援助”来威胁日本，并诬指被氢弹伤害的日本渔民为间谍。而且，据今年四月十四日日本“赤旗报”报道，最近美国竟以军用飞机把广岛原子弹轰炸下受伤的二十名少女运往纽约，作为它研究原子弹效果的“豚鼠”。与此同时，美国正在全世界各地变本加厉地进行准备原子战争的罪恶活动。
    日本人民在要求禁止原子武器的斗争的实践中，愈来愈认识到美国的侵略和战争政策对日本所包含的严重祸害，他们也更加深切地感到必须尽速摆脱美国的占领。因此，日本人民要求禁止原子武器的斗争已经和反对美国占领、反对美国重新武装日本的斗争结合在一起。随着要求禁止原子武器斗争的发展，日本人民争取和平和民族独立斗争的统一战线正在迅速壮大和巩固，日本人民的反美情绪正在迅速高涨。一贯屈从美国，支持美国在太平洋试验氢弹、使日本充当美国侵略工具的吉田政府，在日本人民强大的压力下终于倒台了。
    日本人民要求禁止原子武器的斗争，是维护日本人民的安全，同时也是维护世界和平和人类安全的正义行动，它得到了各国人民和许多国家政府领袖的同情和支持。日本渔民被害事件发生后，要求停止氢弹试验的呼声传遍了全世界。一九五四年广岛市长发出的要求禁止原子武器的呼吁信，得到了莫斯科、列宁格勒、北京、华沙、布拉格等许多城市市长代表各该城市人民的复信支持。世界和平理事会书记处去年曾写信给日本人民，表示世界和平力量完全支持日本人民的正义斗争。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会在今年一月给“日本人民要求禁止原子武器全国大会”的电报中，代表中国人民表示坚决支持日本人民禁止原子武器的斗争。
    目前，日本人民正在热烈响应世界和平理事会常务委员会今年一月发表的“告全世界人民书”的号召，更广泛深入地展开要求禁止原子武器签名运动，并按照亚洲国家会议作出的纪念广岛被炸十周年的决议，积极进行准备工作。五月十日，日本发起的“禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会”的日本筹备委员会在东京举行会议，决定在美国用原子弹轰炸广岛十周年纪念日的八月六日起，连续在广岛举行“禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会”四天，并于八月十五日在东京举行大会的最后会议。热切要求和平的日本人民正和全世界人民一道，把制止原子战争、要求和平利用原子能的斗争推向一个新的高潮。
