Wuhan's various departments are vigorously supporting the national key industrial construction projects in the Wuhan area. The Municipal Construction Bureau carried out urban planning and built roads such as the Wuchang Diyao Highway and the Hankou Hanhhuang Crossroads, which were needed for key construction projects. This year, the Municipal Labour Bureau has successively transferred a total of 475 technical workers and technicians in more than 20 types of work, including lathe workers, fitters, drillers, sheet metal workers, welders, and truck drivers, to 14 new and expanded factories in the Wuhan area. In order to meet the transportation needs of the Yangtze River Bridge and other construction sites, the Municipal Ferry Company has not only opened two new routes, but also recently carried out the relocation of ferries and special wharves. Public buses in Wuhan have successively been opened to several construction sites. The water supply capacity of the Water Company has increased by more than one-fifth. Over the past few months, the Wuhan Department Store and Retail Company have established 47 fixed supply stations and seven mobile service groups at basic construction sites. Recently, relevant agencies have also sent people to construction units and basic construction sites to understand the needs of the construction departments and formulate support plans. Some units have also established special management agencies to support basic construction.

In order to further promote the development of the work of supporting basic construction, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee jointly convened the city's first conference to support basic construction on May 16 and 17. The meeting decided to strengthen the planning and organizational leadership of the work of supporting basic construction, and made specific arrangements for the city's work of supporting basic construction in the future.

    武汉各部门支援重点建设工程
    武汉市各部门正大力支援武汉地区的国家重点工业建设工程。市建设局进行了城市规划，修建了重点建设工程需要的武昌堤腰公路和汉口汉黄岔路等道路。市劳动局今年先后抽调了车工、钳工、钻工、冷作工、电焊工、汽车司机等二十多个工种的技术工人和技术员共四百七十五人，分别输送到武汉地区的新建和扩建的十四个工厂里去。市轮渡公司为了满足长江大桥等工地运输上的需要，除新辟两条航线外，最近又进行了轮渡和专用码头的迁移工作。武汉市的公共汽车已先后通车到几个建设工地。自来水公司的供水能力提高了五分之一以上。武汉市百货公司和零售公司几个月来在基本建设工地设立了四十七个固定供应站和七个流动服务组。最近，各有关机关还派人到建设单位和基本建设工地了解建设部门的需要，制定了支援计划。有的单位还建立了支援基本建设的专管机构。
    为了进一步推动支援基本建设工作的开展，中共武汉市委员会和武汉市人民委员会在五月十六、十七日两天联合召开了全市第一次支援基本建设会议。会议决定加强支援基本建设工作的计划性和组织领导，并对今后全市支援基本建设的工作作了具体安排。　（牛文  李燕庆）
