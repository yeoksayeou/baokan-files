Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 1st — President Eisenhower held a press conference on May 31st.

Regarding China's expulsion of four U.S. Air Force personnel, including Parks, who flew U.S. military aircraft into Chinese airspace to carry out harassment and provocations, Eisenhower said that this was a "symbol of China's intention to do something to help ease tensions."

At the same time, Eisenhower did not indicate what measures the United States was prepared to take to ease tensions in the Far East, particularly in the Taiwan area. He stated that the United States does not intend to "abandon" Quemoy and Matsu.

Speaking about the Four-Power Summit, Eisenhower said that, in the view of the U.S. government, the Four-Power Summit should not aim to resolve specific issues. He believes that the purpose of the meeting should be to examine the situation and determine the procedures that may be followed in resolving issues in the future.

He also told reporters that he would attend the opening ceremony of the United Nations Commemorative Conference in San Francisco.
