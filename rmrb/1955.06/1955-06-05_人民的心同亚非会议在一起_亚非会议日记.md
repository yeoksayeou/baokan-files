    The Jubilant Jakarta

    April 26th, Tuesday

    Early in the morning, just like nine days ago, the Andi Road was again lined with people, but today it was not to welcome, but to bid farewell to the Chinese delegation.

    When leaving Bandung, everyone was reluctant not to take one last look. People deliberately had the car pass by Daman Sari, Independence Building, Red and White Flag Building…

    This city aroused deep love in us, not only because of the beauty of its scenery, not only because of the enthusiasm of its people, but also because it is a testament to the solidarity of Asia and Africa.

    With reluctance, we bid farewell to the people who had kept watch in Daman Sari for nine days, and to the people who had rushed to Andi Airport early in the morning.

    Half an hour later, we returned to Jakarta.

    When the plane was about to land, it could be seen that the number of people gathered inside and outside the airport today was much larger than when we first arrived.

    Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo was the first to greet Premier Zhou Enlai, who was the first to step off the plane.

    The Chief of Protocol of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kusumo Udojo, then led Premier Zhou Enlai to the reviewing stand.

    The band played the national anthems of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia. Then, Premier Zhou reviewed the Indonesian guard of honor.

    At the airport, Premier Zhou delivered a written statement to the press, extending warm greetings to the Indonesian people and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo rode in a car to the Presidential Palace. Along the way, entire streets were lined with welcoming people. They welcomed the distinguished guests from a friendly neighbor with great enthusiasm, welcoming the first Chinese Premier to visit Indonesia.

    The center of the stone steps of the Independence Palace was covered with a bright red carpet to welcome the distinguished guests, and President Sukarno waited in person. When he shook hands tightly with Premier Zhou Enlai, thunderous applause erupted outside the door.

    Twenty minutes later, Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, passed through the large garden to the other part of the Presidential Palace – the State Palace – to rest. The five-star red flag was raised on the flagpole in front of the State Palace, flying together with the red and white flag.

    As the city, which had been excited all morning, gradually calmed down, propaganda vehicles broadcast on all the main streets: At four o'clock this afternoon, Premier Zhou Enlai will tour the city with President Sukarno.

    Jakarta boiled again.

    From a little after two o'clock in the afternoon, people continuously gathered along the sides of the routes that had been announced as scheduled to be passed through.

    It was a sultry afternoon that made people feel suffocated, but people stood there as if they neither knew heat nor fatigue. Every face was smiling, whether it was male or female, old or young, Indonesian or Chinese...

    At half past four in the afternoon, led by motorcycles and jeeps, a brown convertible car drove out of the Presidential Palace. On the left side of the front of the car flew the five-star red flag, on the right side flew the red and white flag, and in the center of the license plate was a striking number – Indonesian Number One.

    This was the Indonesian President's car, with President Sukarno sitting on the right and Premier Zhou Enlai sitting on the left.

    The thousands upon thousands of people gathered outside the Presidential Palace raised thousands upon thousands of hands, applauding and cheering.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and President Sukarno stood up in the car and waved to the people in return.

    From Harmony along Gajah Mada Avenue, turning from Danan Men to Stone Bridge Head, this three or four kilometer stretch of street seemed to have become a sea of people. In the eyes were only densely packed heads and densely packed raised hands. In the ears, one could only hear thunderous cheers and thunderous applause. The trams and cars on the street were stopped, and the roofs were full of people. There were also countless people perched on rooftops and climbing trees, waving and cheering at Premier Zhou Enlai and President Sukarno.

    The car arrived on Jakarta Avenue. It is said that it was originally a remote industrial area, but now it was also full of people. When it arrived at Old Bazaar, the people became more and more crowded, and the enthusiasm of the masses rose to a new climax. People smiled, jumped, and shouted, "Long live," "Long live," "Ten thousand years."

    When the car reached Garawi Street, a sudden downpour came. Premier Zhou Enlai and President Sukarno, who had been standing and waving to the people, switched to a car with a canopy. However, the masses on both sides still cheered for their beloved leaders regardless of everything.

    The car passed through Silimpa Street, turned into Diponegoro Street and Imam Bonjol Street, General Sudirman Street, and the Bayoran Baru New District. The rain became heavier and heavier, but the number of people welcoming in the rain did not decrease. Many people braved the heavy rain to run from one street to another, in order to get one more glimpse of the Chinese delegation.

    At half past six, Premier Zhou Enlai and President Sukarno returned to the Independence Palace. At this time, the people on the surrounding streets all surged towards the palace, regardless of the wind and rain, regardless of their soaked clothes, they frantically waved and cheered towards the Independence Palace.

    President Sukarno and Premier Zhou Enlai stood on the stone steps of the Independence Palace. They faced everyone, raised their hands, and smiled in thanks.

    Applause and cheers continued for several minutes. The feelings of the masses and the leaders, the feelings of Indonesians and Chinese, merged together.

    An Indonesian official said: "In the history of Jakarta, there have been few more enthusiastic events than today. Hundreds of thousands of Jakartans were on the streets today. Jakartans will never forget this day."

    For every Chinese person in Jakarta today, he will never forget this day either. Forget not the love of the Indonesian people for the Chinese people and the love of the overseas Chinese for the motherland, as expressed in the magnificent picture of Jakarta today.

    At seven o'clock in the evening, President Sukarno held a state banquet at the Independence Palace to welcome all the representatives and advisors of the delegation of the People's Republic of China.

    At nine o'clock, an Indonesian song and dance evening was held at the State Palace to entertain the distinguished guests.

    This was a day filled with friendship and enthusiasm. (To be continued)

    人民的心同亚非会议在一起

    欢腾的雅加达
    四月二十六日　星期二
    清早，和九天以前一样，安第公路上又排满了人，不过今天不是欢迎，而是欢送中国代表团。
    在离开万隆的时候，谁都舍不得不多看她一眼，人们故意让汽车经过达曼·沙里，独立大厦，红白旗大厦……
    这个城市引起我们深深的爱，不仅因为她景色的美丽，不仅因为她人民的热情，也因为她是亚洲和非洲团结的见证。
    我们怀着依依不舍的心情，向在达曼·沙里守了九天的人们，向一早就赶到安第机场上来的人们告别。
    半个钟头以后，我们回到了雅加达。
    飞机将要着陆的时候，可以看得到今天聚集在机场内外的人比上次初来的时候多得多。
    印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约首先上来迎接打头从飞机上走下去的周恩来总理。
    印度尼西亚外交部的礼宾司司长古苏摩乌多约随后把周恩来总理引到检阅台上。
    乐队奏起了中华人民共和国国歌和印度尼西亚共和国国歌。接着，周总理检阅了印度尼西亚的仪仗队。
    在机场上，周总理向报界发表了书面谈话，向印度尼西亚人民和印度尼西亚共和国政府热烈地致意。
    周恩来总理和沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理坐在一辆汽车里向独立宫总统府进发。沿途，整条整条的街道两边都站满了欢迎的人。他们以极大的热忱来欢迎从一个友好的邻邦来的贵宾，欢迎第一个到印度尼西亚来访问的中国总理。
    独立宫的石阶正中今天铺上了迎接贵宾的大红地毡，苏加诺总统亲自等候。当他和周恩来总理紧紧握手的时候，门外掌声震天。
    二十分钟以后，周恩来总理由沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理陪同穿过大花园到总统府的另一部分——国家宫休息。国家宫前的旗杆上升起了五星红旗，同红白旗飘扬在一起。
    激动了一早晨的城市渐渐平静下来的时候，宣传车又在所有主要的大街上广播了：今天下午四点钟，周恩来总理要在苏加诺总统陪同下巡游全市。
    雅加达重又沸腾起来了。
    从下午两点多钟起，凡是通知预定要经过的路线两旁，就不断有人在集中。
    这是一个闷热得令人感到窒息的下午，但是，人们站在那里，像是既不知道热，也不知道累。每
  一张脸都是笑着的，不论是男的还是女的，老的还是小的，印度尼西亚人还是中国人……。
    下午四点半，在摩托车和吉普车的导引下，一辆棕色的敞篷汽车驶出了总统府。车头左边飘着五星红旗，右边飘着红白旗，正中车牌上是一个触目的数字——印度尼西亚第一号。
    这是印度尼西亚总统的座车，车上右边坐着苏加诺总统，左边坐着周恩来总理。
    总统府外面聚集着的千千万万群众，高举起千千万万只手鼓掌欢呼。
    周恩来总理和苏加诺总统在车上站起来，向人们举手答礼。
    从哈摩尼沿加渣马达大街，大南门转到石桥头这一段三四公里长的大街两边，看来已成了一片人海，眼睛里只有密密层层的人头，密密层层的高举着的手。耳朵里只听见雷鸣似的欢呼，雷鸣似的掌声。街上的电车、汽车都停了，车顶上都站满了人。还有无数的人高踞在屋顶上，爬在树上，朝着周恩来总理和苏加诺总统挥手欢呼。
    汽车走到雅加达大街了，据说原来是僻静的工业区，现在也站满了人，到老巴沙了，人越来越拥挤，群众的热情上涨到新的高潮，人们笑着，跳着，叫着：“万岁”，“万岁”，“万万岁”。
    到加拉未大街的时候，突然降下了暴雨。一直站着向人们答礼的周恩来总理和苏加诺总统换登上了有篷的汽车。然而，两旁的群众还是不顾一切地向他们敬爱的领袖欢呼。
    汽车经过士林巴街转进狄波尼哥罗街和伊曼本佐尔街，苏第曼将军街，峇油兰新区。雨越下越大，然而站在雨里欢迎的群众却并没有减少。许多人冒着大雨从一条街跑到另一条街，为的是要多看
  一眼中国代表团。
    六点半钟，周恩来总理和苏加诺总统回到独立宫。这时，四围大街上的人们一齐向宫涌来，不顾风吹雨打，不顾衣衫湿透，他们狂热地朝着独立宫挥手欢呼。
    苏加诺总统和周恩来总理站在独立宫的石阶上。他们面向大家，举起手来，微笑答谢。
    掌声，欢呼声，一直继续了几分钟。群众和领袖，印度尼西亚人和中国人的感情交融在一起。
      一个印度尼西亚官员说：“在雅加达历史上，很少有比今天更狂热的盛况了。几十万雅加达人今天是在大街上。雅加达人将永远忘不了这一天。”
    对于每一个今天在雅加达的中国人说来，他也将永远忘不了这一天。忘不了雅加达今天以壮丽的图景所表现了的印度尼西亚人民对中国人民的爱和华侨对祖国的爱。
    晚上七点钟，苏加诺总统在独立宫举行国宴，欢迎中华人民共和国代表团全体代表和顾问。
    九点钟，在国家宫又举行了印度尼西亚的歌舞晚会来招待贵宾们。
    这是洋溢着友谊和热情的一天。                （待续）
