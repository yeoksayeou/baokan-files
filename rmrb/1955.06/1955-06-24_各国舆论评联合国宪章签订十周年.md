    International Opinion on the Tenth Anniversary of the Signing of the United Nations Charter
      Po　land
    The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial commenting on the tenth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, saying: The United Nations should help peacefully resolve international disputes, which requires consensus among major powers when making decisions. However, a great power in the world, the great People's Republic of China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, does not yet have a representative in the United Nations, which undermines the prestige of the United Nations. The lack of representatives from Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania in the United Nations also undermines the prestige of the United Nations.
    Czechoslovakia
    "Red Rights" newspaper said on the 21st, while commenting on the tenth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, "The American aggressive bloc obstructs the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations, rudely destroying the (United Nations) Charter." The newspaper believes that this is an abnormal situation.
    Romania
    The Romanian "Spark" newspaper published an article pointing out that the United States violates the provisions of the United Nations Charter and paralyzes the United Nations organization. Contrary to this policy of the United States, the Soviet Union has made every effort to promote the realization of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, making this organization an important tool for maintaining peace and expanding peaceful cooperation between countries. The article said that what is particularly harmful to the prestige of the United Nations organization at present is that, due to the obstruction of the ruling groups in the United States, the representatives of the legal government of 600 million Chinese people - the government of the People's Republic of China - are still not in the United Nations organization.
      In　dia
    The Indian "New Century" newspaper published an editorial on the 21st on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter. The editorial said that the United Nations should faithfully work to defend peace in accordance with the Charter and should not become a tool in the hands of imperialist countries. The editorial called for the restoration of the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
      The "Epoch-Making News" editorial on the 20th expressed regret that the United Nations had not been able to fulfill its obligations in the past and criticized the United Nations for refusing to restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
      Indonesia
    The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an article on the 20th commenting on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, saying that in the past ten years, the United Nations has not been able to meet mankind's hopes for lasting peace under the manipulation of the United States.
    The article said that the people of the world should strive to get the United Nations on its correct path to fulfill its charter of avoiding the danger of war and make it a truly international organization that defends national independence, democracy, and world peace.
    The article then listed the facts that the United Nations had failed to fulfill its charter, saying that the United Nations had obstructed the Indonesian people's struggle against colonialism and for the maintenance of national independence; the United Nations agreed that the United States should wage a barbaric war against the Korean people under the banner of the United Nations; the United Nations passed an "embargo" against People's China and other people's democratic countries; the United Nations failed to stop the Indochina War; efforts to restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations were obstructed by the US-Chiang clique; the United Nations failed to promote the withdrawal of US troops from Taiwan; the United Nations acquiesced in the establishment of military alliances in Europe and Asia, which would provoke wars between countries, The article emphasized that all these improper practices of the United Nations were caused by the United States manipulating this international organization with the help of some countries that hoped to maintain colonial interests.
      France
    Many commentators in Parisian newspapers, when commenting on the tenth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, emphasized the need to restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    For example, Fabiani wrote in "Combat": "The China occupying the United Nations seat is the ridiculous 'China' of Chiang Kai-shek, taking refuge in Taiwan with the defeated remnants, while the real China, with hundreds of millions of people, is completely ignored. This absurd practice and other shortcomings paralyze the United Nations. These shortcomings hinder overcoming the difficulties that prevent the establishment of harmonious relations between the people of the world..."
    Progressive newspapers, in analyzing the activities of the United Nations in the past ten years, expressed the hope that this international organization would become an effective tool for strengthening peace.
      "Humanity" said that the current UN anniversary has attracted the attention of the world's public because "the hopes raised by the upcoming Four Power talks make this San Francisco UN tenth anniversary more significant than would otherwise be the case."
      "Humanity" continued: "Indeed, the prospect of an agreement between the major powers creates the only possibility of restoring people's confidence in the effectiveness of the United Nations. If the United Nations has failed to live up to the expectations of the people of all countries during the ten years since its founding, it is mainly because the principle of unanimity among the major powers has not been observed."　(According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 各国舆论评联合国宪章签订十周年

    各国舆论评联合国宪章签订十周年
      波　兰
    波兰“人民论坛报”发表评论联合国宪章签订十周年的社论说：联合国应该帮助和平解决国际上的争执问题，这就要求在作出决定时，大国之间取得一致。然而，世界上的一个大国、人口占全人类四分之一的伟大的中华人民共和国在联合国还没有代表，这就使联合国的威信受到损害。匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚在联合国里没有代表，也同样使联合国的威信受到损害。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    “红色权利报”二十一日在评论联合国宪章签订十周年纪念时说，“美国侵略集团阻挠中华人民共和国取得它在联合国中的合法地位，粗暴地破坏了（联合国）宪章”。报纸认为这是不正常的局面。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚“火花报”刊载了一篇文章，指出美国违反联合国宪章的规定，瘫痪联合国组织。同美国这种政策相反，苏联竭力促使实现联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，使这个组织成为维护和平、扩大国与国之间的和平合作的一个重要的工具。文章说，目前对于联合国组织的威信特别有害的是，由于美国统治集团的阻挠，在联合国组织里仍然没有六亿中国人民的合法政府——中华人民共和国政府的代表。
      印　度
    印度“新世纪报”二十一日就联合国宪章签订十周年纪念发表社论。社论说，联合国应该依照宪章忠实地为保卫和平而工作，不应该变成帝国主义国家手中的工具。社论要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利。
      “划时代报”二十日的社论对联合国过去没有能履行它的义务表示遗憾，并且抨击联合国拒绝恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位。
      印度尼西亚
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”二十日发表文章评论联合国成立十周年纪念日说，在过去十年中，联合国在美国的操纵下没有能满足人类对持久和平的希望。
    文章说，全世界人民应该努力促使联合国走上它的正确的道路来履行它的避免战争危险的宪章，并且使它成为真正的捍卫民族独立、民主和世界和平的国际组织。
    文章接着列举了联合国未能履行它的宪章的事实说，联合国曾经阻挠了印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义、维护民族独立的斗争；联合国同意美国打着联合国的旗帜对朝鲜人民进行野蛮的战争；联合国通过了对人民中国和其他人民民主国家实行“禁运”；联合国没有能停止印度支那战争；恢复中华人民共和国在联合国合法席位的努力受到美蒋集团的阻挠；联合国没有能促使美国军队撤出台湾；联合国默许在欧洲和亚洲成立军事联盟，这些军事联盟将会挑起国家之间的战争，文章强调指出，联合国的这一切不正当的做法都是由于美国在希望维持殖民利益的一些国家的帮助下操纵这个国际组织而造成的。
      法　国
    许多巴黎报纸的评论员在评论联合国宪章签订十周年的时候，都强调必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。
    例如，法比阿尼在“战斗报”上写道：“占据联合国席位的中国是带同溃败的残军托庇在台湾的蒋介石的可笑的‘中国’，而拥有几亿人民的真正的中国却完全被忽视了。这种荒唐的做法和其他缺点使得联合国陷于瘫痪状态。这种缺点阻挠了克服使世界各国人民之间不能建立和谐的关系的困难……”
    进步的报纸在分析联合国过去十年中的活动时表示希望这个国际组织成为加强和平的有效工具。
      “人道报”说，当前的联合国纪念会吸引了全世界公众的注意，因为“即将举行的四大国谈判所引起的希望使这次旧金山联合国十周年纪念会比在别的情况下有更大的意义。”
      “人道报”继续说：“的确，大国之间取得协议的前景，创造了恢复人们对联合国的有效性的信心的唯一可能性。如果联合国在成立十年期间辜负了各国人民的期望，那主要是由于大国一致的原则没有被遵守。”　（据新华社讯）
