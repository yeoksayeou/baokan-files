    Waste on the Construction Site of the Shizitan Hydropower Station
    Yan Beiyan
    The Shizitan Hydropower Station project in Sichuan Province is an important project in the country's hydropower construction. The construction of the Shizitan Hydropower Station has been successful, but the construction site is also one with serious waste. According to preliminary statistics, waste and stockpiled materials have reached about three million yuan.
    The Shizitan Hydropower Station project started construction without proper preparation. Therefore, plans often fell through, materials were not supplied in time, work was suspended waiting for drawings, equipment, or the cessation of one project waiting for another; sometimes there was massive idleness on one side and emergency crash programs on the other; either the transportation routes were inadequate, or the materials were placed unreasonably, or there was insufficient wind, lack of electricity, or no water, the work was mutually affected, and there was constant quarreling. Waste spread like weeds all over the construction site.
    Here, the allocation of labor was unplanned, and when a project was urgent, people were simply piled on, resulting in a large amount of idleness. When the excavation of the left bank dam foundation was urgent, there were almost one or two workers on every square meter of the working surface, with people crowding and bumping into each other everywhere, and some workers simply couldn't find a place to stand. During the busy construction season in the dry season, at least four to five hundred people were idle every day, and at its worst, there were a thousand people idle every day. Moreover, even now, the phenomenon of idleness is still very serious. A staff member of the construction site dispatching section said: "If we could improve work efficiency a little, we could reduce at least two to three thousand workers on our construction site."
    Due to serious idleness and lax labor discipline, the labor productivity of the Shizitan construction site is very low, which greatly increases the cost of the project. For example, the efficiency of earth and stone excavation has long failed to meet the national quota. According to statistics of six major projects in the dry season, the efficiency of earthwork is 42.4 percent lower than the national quota, and the efficiency of stonework is 30.5 percent lower. The earth and stone excavation of the drainage culvert and dam foundation treatment alone consumed more than 115,400 man-hours more than the national quota. Furthermore, the effective utilization rate of man-hours is also very low. According to the technical assessment of the Hydropower Construction General Bureau, the effective utilization rate of man-hours in three shifts (eight hours per shift) is at most 87.27 percent and at least 34.6 percent, with an average of 70.4 percent.
    The Shizitan construction site has the necessary material basis for improving labor productivity – they have dump trucks, transport trucks, various cranes, tractors, excavators, power shovels, rock loaders, locomotives, winches and other construction machinery. However, these construction machines have encountered a lazy master. Many machines are left unused, while on the other hand, a large amount of manpower is used. Because a large number of machines are left idle, many drivers and maintenance workers are idle all day long. Several tractor drivers routinely oil, add water, wipe the dust off the machines, drive the tractors around the parking lot once, activate the machines, and then leave them idle again. This goes on day after day, month after month. A female tractor driver said: "We have become tractor drivers who don't tow or pull. It's really sad to see such a big project and not be able to contribute."
    Failure to prepare construction organization measures plans and blindly purchasing materials are also important reasons for waste. A large amount of steel, wood, nan bamboo and other building materials were transported from various places, but unsuitable, surplus, and outdated materials were stockpiled without timely disposal. According to preliminary estimates, the stockpiled funds totaled more than 1.5 million yuan.
    There are no correct budget and quota restrictions on the use of materials, and there is no sound system for issuing and returning materials. As much as is needed is given, and whatever is wanted is given. According to preliminary calculations, the waste of materials amounts to more than 200,000 yuan. The drainage culvert project alone exceeded the material quota and consumed 11,700 kilograms of explosives and 83,200 detonators more. As for the "using large materials for small purposes" and "using good materials for inferior purposes" in the use of materials, it is an even more common phenomenon. Moreover, due to the lack of a clear responsibility system and good work order, the damage of tools and materials and the loss of public property are also very alarming. There are more than 300 pneumatic picks and drills in the entire construction site, and most of them were damaged in just a few months.
    The severity of material losses caused by the lack of a responsibility system and work discipline can also be illustrated by the following example: People often find some inexplicable houses on the construction site. When were these houses built? Who approved the construction? Where did the materials come from? What were they built for? Even the relevant负责人 (fù zé rén: person in charge) on the construction site couldn't answer. Later, after an inspection, it was found that this was because there was no strict material management system, and the workers "automatically" took public materials to build them. Li Sen, the leader of the first squad of the embankment team, and Hu Kun of the material section, along with dozens of others, wanted to set up a small mess hall, so they privately took public materials to build four kitchens. A supply and marketing cooperative near the construction site purchased more than 2,200 kilograms of red copper wire and purple copper sheets from August 17 last year to February 15 this year, including bundles of brand-new red copper wire. According to the person in charge of the cooperative, these things were sold by the employees, family members, and nearby farmers of the construction site. The supply and marketing cooperative felt that there was a problem, so it officially sent a letter to the leaders of the construction site, hoping to draw attention to and stop it, but the leaders of the construction site did not take this issue seriously, and this phenomenon has not been completely overcome so far.
    The construction project of the Shizitan Hydropower Station is being carried out under the circumstances of surveying, designing, and constructing at the same time, which has caused some difficulties for the progress of the construction project. However, the main reason for the large waste on the Shizitan construction site does not lie here. The main reason is that the leading staff members do not have a sufficient understanding of the complexity of large-scale industrial construction, especially the complexity of hydropower station construction. There is a lack of preparation before construction, a lack of planning and organizational work that can adapt to the project tasks, and a lack of regular political work and strict inspection systems, which has caused the serious waste on this construction site to exist for a long time and cannot be overcome. The leading staff members of the Shizitan Hydropower Station construction project must learn from this lesson, carry out a mass movement to practice strict economy and oppose waste, and not allow the country's construction funds to be lost.

    狮子滩水电站工地上的浪费
    颜北岩
    四川省狮子滩水力发电站工程是国家水电建设中的一项重要工程。狮子滩水电站的建设是有成绩的，但这个工地也是一个浪费严重的工地。据初步统计，浪费和积压材料已达三百万元左右。
    狮子滩水电站工程没有做好施工准备工作就开工了。因此，经常是计划落空，材料供应不及时，停工等待图纸、待设备或停止这项工程等待那项工程；有时一边大量窝工一边紧急突击；不是交通线路不够，就是材料放置得不合理，或者少风、缺电、无水，工作起来相互影响，成天吵吵嚷嚷。浪费就像野草一样在施工现场上到处蔓延开来。
    这里的劳动力的调配没有计划，那里工程紧急，那里就用人去堆，结果造成大量窝工。当左岸坝基开挖工程紧急时，几乎每一平方公尺的工作面上都有一、两个工人，到处是人挤人、人撞人，有的工人根本站不拢。在枯水季工程紧张施工的时候，每天还至少有四、五百人窝工，最严重的时候每天曾有千人窝工。而且，直到现在，窝工现象还很严重。工地调度科一个工作人员说：“如果把工效提高一些，我们工地至少可以减少两、三千工人。”
    由于严重的窝工和劳动纪律松弛，狮子滩工地的劳动生产率非常低，大大增加了工程成本。例如土石方开挖的工效长期达不到国家定额，根据枯水季六项主要工程的统计：土方工效比国家定额低百分之四十二点四，石方工效低百分之三十点五。仅排水涵洞和坝基处理两项工程的土石方开挖，即较国家定额多耗费了工时十一万五千四百多个。再如工时的有效利用率也很低，据水力发电建设总局的技术查定，三班制（每班八小时）的工时有效利用率最高为百分之八十七点二七，最低为百分之三十四点六，平均为百分之七十点四。
    狮子滩工地拥有提高劳动生产率的必要的物质基础——他们有自卸卡车、运输卡车、各式起重机、拖拉机、挖土机、电铲、装岩机、机关车、卷扬机等施工机械。但是这些施工机械却遇到一个懒惰的主人，许多机械被搁置未用，而另一方面却用了大量的人力。由于大量的机械停着不用，许多驾驶工人和检修工人成天闲着没有活干。几个拖拉机手，每天照例上上油，加加水，揩擦一下机器上的灰尘，再在停车场上开起拖拉机走一转，活动活动机械，然后又搁置下来。就这样日复一日、月复一月地过去了。一个女拖拉机手说：“我们成了不拖不拉的拖拉机手了，看着这么大的工程使不上力，心里真难过。”
    没有编制施工组织措施计划，盲目采购材料，也是造成浪费的重要原因。大量钢材、木料、楠竹和其他建筑器材等从各地运来后，不合用的，多余的和过时的就堆存起来，也没有及时处理，据初步估计，积压资金共达一百五十多万元。
    在材料使用上没有正确的预算和定额限制，没有健全的领退料制度，要多少给多少，要什么给什么，据初步计算材料上的浪费达二十多万元。仅排水涵洞一项工程超过用料定额，就多耗费了炸药一万一千七百公斤，多耗费了雷管八万三千二百多个。至于材料使用上的“大材小用”“优材劣用”更是普遍存在的现象。而且由于没有严明的责任制度和良好的工作秩序，工具材料的损坏和公物的遗失也是很惊人的。全工地共有风镐风钻三百多台，不到几个月时间，绝大部分都损坏了。
    缺乏责任制度和工作纪律所造成的材料损失的严重程度，还可以用这样的例子来说明：人们在工地上经常发现一些没有来由的房子。这些房子是什么时候盖的？是谁批准盖的？材料是那里来的？盖了干什么用的？连工地上有关负责人也答不上来。后来一检查，才知道原来是因为没有严格的材料管理制度，工人们“自动”拿了公家材料来盖的。筑堤队第一班班长李森和材料科胡梱等数十人，想办一个小伙食团，便私取公家材料修建了四间厨房。工地附近的一个供销合作社，从去年八月十七日到今年二月十五日的六个月中，收购了二千二百多斤红铜线和紫铜片，其中还有成捆的崭新的红铜丝。据合作社负责人说，这些东西都是工地的职工、家属和附近的农民卖出来的。这个供销合作社觉得里面有问题，便正式去公函通知工地领导上，希望引起重视并加以制止，但是工地领导上并未认真重视这个问题，至今这个现象还没有完全克服。
    狮子滩水电站的建设工程，是在边勘测、边设计、边施工的情况下进行的，这给建设工程的进展造成了一些困难。但狮子滩工地浪费大的主要原因却不在这里。主要原因是领导工作人员对大规模工业建设的复杂性、尤其是对水电站建设的复杂性认识不足，施工前缺乏准备，缺乏能够同工程任务相适应的计划工作和组织工作，又缺乏经常的政治工作和严格的检查制度，因而使这个工地的严重浪费长期存在，不能克服。狮子滩水电站建设工程的领导工作人员必须吸取这个教训，开展一个群众性的厉行节约、反对浪费的运动，不让国家建设资金受到损失。
