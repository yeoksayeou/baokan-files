    Strengthen Cornfield Management, Strive for a Bumper Harvest
    Ma Jueweng
    This year, many regions have expanded the area planted with corn. According to incomplete statistics from ten key corn-producing provinces, the area has increased by approximately 13 million mu compared to last year. Currently, it is the growth and development period for corn. To ensure increased corn production, in general corn-producing areas, it is necessary to earnestly lead farmers in carrying out a series of field management tasks. In newly expanded corn planting areas, technical guidance for cornfield management should be strengthened.
    Doing a good job of intertillage and soil cultivation is the primary task in field management. Corn is an intertilled crop. Timely intertillage can loosen the soil, conserve moisture, eliminate weeds in the field, and promote robust seedling growth and root development, which is crucial for guaranteeing a good harvest. For example, in Chenxi Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chuxian County, Anhui Province, in 1953, the cornfields were hoed one extra time due to drought, resulting in a yield increase of 10 to 20 percent compared to nearby fields. Corn generally requires three to four intertillages. The first is combined with thinning and setting seedlings, the second is done when the seedlings are about one foot tall, and the third and fourth are done before and after corn tasseling. According to the experience of farmers in Yongning County, Guangxi Province, the intertillage period should adhere to "three hoeings": hoeing after rain or irrigation to loosen the soil, promote root growth, and retain moisture; hoeing when there are weeds to prevent their growth and consumption of nutrients; and hoeing during prolonged droughts to prevent moisture evaporation and increase drought resistance. During the last one or two intertillages, soil should be cultivated to prevent corn lodging. In areas with more rainfall, this also helps with drainage. In 1953, the Wang Yanfu Mutual Aid Team in Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, combined soil cultivation with the last one or two intertillages. After several strong winds, most of the corn did not lodge. However, three mu of corn belonging to Xia Yulong nearby were not cultivated with soil, and most of it was blown down by the wind, hindering normal growth and reducing yield.
    Corn plants are tall and have well-developed roots, requiring more nutrients and water. Timely topdressing and appropriate irrigation to fully meet the needs of corn at each stage of growth and development are important conditions for ensuring increased corn production. In 1954, the Golden Queen corn in the Tongxin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhuman Township, 14th District, Feixian County, Shandong Province, under the same cultivation conditions, yielded 714.5 jin per mu after being topdressed with urine once after setting seedlings, an increase of 14.6 percent compared to those not topdressed. Topdressing should mainly use quick-acting fertilizers such as liquid manure or well-rotted farmyard manure. The timing, amount, and frequency of topdressing should be determined according to the corn's growth conditions. Generally, topdressing should be done after setting seedlings and before tasseling to supply the nutrients needed for the early growth stage and tasseling and grain-filling stages of corn. To use fertilizer economically and maximize its effectiveness, concentrated application methods should be promoted. In this year of expanded corn planting, when fertilizer is generally scarce, vigorous efforts should be made to mobilize farmers to develop fertilizer sources, accumulate as much fertilizer as possible, and strive to transport it to the fields before corn tasseling for application around the plants. Timely irrigation of corn is very important. Especially during the period from tasseling to maturity, corn needs more water. If the climate and soil are dry during this period, it will have the greatest impact on yield. Therefore, special attention must be paid to irrigation during this period. In areas without irrigation conditions, soil moisture conservation through hoeing should also be done well. Irrigation combined with topdressing will yield better results. In the southern regions with more rainfall, attention should also be paid to cleaning furrow ditches in the cornfields to facilitate drainage.
    The corn borer is a serious threat to corn growth. Vigorously preventing and controlling corn borers is an effective measure to increase corn production currently. According to the experience of various regions in recent years in controlling corn borers, using "666" solution to irrigate the heart leaves after the corn borer larvae have hatched generally achieves a kill rate of over 90 percent. In 1954, Henan Province used "666" solution to irrigate the heart leaves to control corn borers, resulting in an average increase of 27 jin of corn per mu. The results of corn borer control in Hebei Province over the past three years have shown an average increase of 15 percent per mu. However, in the past, some farmers in some areas believed that irrigating the heart leaves with "666" solution easily caused phytotoxicity and therefore did not dare to use it. In fact, as long as attention is paid to the concentration of the medicine, phytotoxicity can be avoided. Experience has shown that a concentration of 6% wettable "666" powder diluted with 500 to 800 times water is the most appropriate. When irrigating, pay attention to stirring frequently and shaking constantly to ensure the concentration of the solution is uniform and does not settle, so as to avoid phytotoxicity.
    Conducting artificial assisted pollination of corn is also a way to increase the yield per unit area. Experiments and mass production practices in various regions have proven that corn with artificial assisted pollination generally yields about 10 percent more. For example, the results of eleven comparative experiments in Changzhi, Yuci, and Xinzhou prefectures in Shanxi in 1954 showed that corn with artificial assisted pollination generally increased production by 7.8 to 18.2 percent. In 1954, Laiwu, Huangxian, Juxian, and other places in Shandong Province promoted artificial assisted pollination on more than 100,000 mu of corn land, generally increasing production by 7 to 8 percent. Artificial assisted pollination of corn should begin during the peak flowering period, from after the dew has dried in the morning until 11:00 AM. Conduct it every one to two days, for a total of two to three times, and pay attention to pollination in the later stages. This will ensure that the corn ears are fully pollinated, reduce the occurrence of bald tips and missing kernels, and ensure full kernels. During the corn flowering period, if there are unfavorable weather conditions such as extreme heat, wind, or rain, artificial assisted pollination will have a more significant effect on increasing production. In the past, some farmers believed that "artificial assisted pollination is troublesome and labor-intensive and may not necessarily increase production." Therefore, it is necessary to actively publicize and demonstrate its benefits to them.

    加强玉米田间管理，争取丰收
    马矍翁
    今年很多地区扩大了玉米种植面积，据十个产玉米的重点省的不完全统计，即比去年扩大约一千三百多万亩。目前正是玉米生长发育时期，要保证玉米增产，在一般玉米产区必须切实领导农民做好一系列的田间管理工作；在新扩大玉米种植面积的地区，应加强对玉米田间管理的技术指导。
    做好中耕培土是田间管理中的首要工作。玉米是中耕作物。及时中耕可以松土保墒，消灭田间杂草，促使幼苗植株健壮和根系发育，对于保证收成有决定作用。如安徽省滁县城西乡农业生产合作社，一九五三年因天旱玉米地及时多锄了一遍，结果比附近的地增产一成到二成。玉米一般须中耕三次到四次，第一次结合间苗定苗进行，第二次在苗高一尺左右时进行，第三、四次在玉米抽穗前和抽穗后进行。根据广西省邕宁县农民的经验，中耕时期并应做到“三锄”：即下雨或灌溉后要锄，以松土发根，保持水分，促进生长；有草时要锄，以免杂草滋长，消耗养分；久旱不雨要锄，以防止水分蒸发，增加抗旱能力。进行最后一、二次中耕时，要结合进行培土，以防止玉米倒伏；在雨量较多时，这样做还利于排水。一九五三年江苏省泗阳县王延富互助组在最后一、二次中耕时，结合进行培土，经过许多次大风，玉米大部没有倒伏；邻近的夏雨龙的三亩玉米因为未进行培土，大部被风吹倒，不能正常生长，因而减少了产量。
    玉米的植株高大，根部发达，需要养料和水分较多。及时追肥和适时灌溉，充分满足玉米各个生长发育阶段对水分和肥料的需要，是保证玉米增产的重要条件。一九五四年山东省费县十四区诸满乡同心农业生产合作社的金皇后玉米在同样的栽培条件下，定苗后浇尿一次的每亩产七百一十四斤半，比未浇尿的增产百分之十四点六。追肥应当以水粪或腐熟的厩肥等速效性肥料为主。施用追肥的时间、用量和次数应视玉米生长情况而定，一般要掌握定苗后、抽穗前两个时期追肥，以供给玉米生长前期和抽穗结实时所需要的养料。为了经济用肥和充分发挥肥效，要提倡集中施肥的方法。在今年扩大玉米种植，肥料普遍较缺的情况下，应大力发动农民开辟肥源，增积可能积聚的肥料，争取在玉米抽穗以前运往田间按株追施。对玉米适时进行灌溉是很重要的；尤其在玉米抽穗前后到成熟时，需要更多水分，这时，如遇气候和土质干旱，对产量影响最大，因此在这个时期必须特别注意进行灌溉。在没有水浇条件的地区，也要做好锄地保墒工作。灌溉结合追肥进行，收效更好。在雨水较多的南方地区，还要注意做好玉米地的清理畦沟工作，以利排水。
    玉米钻心虫（即玉米螟）是玉米生长的严重威胁，大力防治玉米钻心虫，是当前增加玉米产量的一项有效措施。根据近年来各地防治玉米钻心虫的经验，在玉米钻心虫幼虫孵化后，用“六六六”药液灌心叶法进行防治，一般杀虫率在百分之九十以上。河南省一九五四年采用“六六六”液灌心叶防治玉米钻心虫，平均每亩增产玉米二十七斤。河北省三年来防治玉米钻心虫的结果，每亩平均增产百分之十五。但过去有一些地区的农民认为用“六六六”液灌心叶容易发生药害，因而不敢采用；其实只要注意用药浓度，药害是可以避免的。经验证明：配药的浓度以百分之六可湿性“六六六”粉加水五百至八百倍最为妥当。灌药时要注意勤搅拌、常摇动，使药液浓度均匀，不发生沉淀现象，以免发生药害。
    进行玉米人工辅助授粉，也是提高玉米单位面积产量的办法。各地试验和群众的生产实践证明，实行人工辅助授粉的玉米一般可增产一成左右。例如山西长治、榆次、忻县等专区一九五四年十一个对比试验的结果证明，人工辅助授粉的玉米一般增产百分之七点八到十八点二；山东省莱芜、黄县、莒县等地一九五四年在十余万亩玉米地上推行人工辅助授粉，一般增产百分之七到八。玉米人工辅助授粉应在开花盛期开始，上午露水干后到十一时前进行。每隔一两天进行一次，共需进行两三次，并须注意后期授粉。这样才能保证玉米雌穗受粉完全，减少秃顶和缺粒现象，并能保证结实饱满。在玉米开花期间，如果遇到酷热、刮风、下雨等不利的气候，进行人工辅助授粉对增产的作用更为显著。过去有些农民认为“人工辅助授粉麻烦、费工，不一定能增产。”因此应积极向他们进行宣传示范，说明人工辅助授粉的好处。
