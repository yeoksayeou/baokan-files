Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th: More than 800 representatives from all circles in Pyongyang held a gathering on the 24th to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Korean people's war against the American imperialist aggression.

Attending the meeting were Korean Workers' Party and government leaders Park Chang-ok, Kim Il, Choi Chang-ik, Park Ui-wan, Park Kim-chul, Li Young and others, leaders of various democratic parties, heads of social organizations, senior generals of the Korean People's Army, combat heroes, etc.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, led by Chief Delegate General Wang Yongnian, was invited to attend the meeting.

Pan Zili, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and diplomatic officials from other countries stationed in Korea were also invited to attend the meeting.

Korean People's Army Lieutenant General Kim Bong-ryul delivered a report at the meeting. He said: The Korean people are rapidly restoring and developing the people's economy and improving the people's livelihood after the war, and are carrying out a consistent struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. However, the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are doing everything possible to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea and are preparing for a new war in violation of the armistice agreement. Kim Bong-ryul said: The Korean people's will to peacefully reunify the motherland is firm and unshakable. The Korean people will surely shatter any conspiracy of the enemy and complete the great cause of unifying the motherland.

General Wang Yongnian, Chief Delegate of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, then spoke at the meeting. He said: The American aggressors are doing their best to expand the military strength of the Syngman Rhee clique in an attempt to launch a new war. However, today the strength of the peaceful, democratic and socialist camp is unprecedentedly strong. If the American aggressors dare to risk launching a war, they will surely fail. He said: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is vigilantly guarding its positions, and defending the peaceful labor of the people of China and Korea side by side with the Korean People's Army.
