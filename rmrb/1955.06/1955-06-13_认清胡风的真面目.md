    Recognize Hu Feng's True Colors
    Xu Guangping

    When I returned to Beijing from abroad in February, I read some documents issued by the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles regarding the criticism of Hu Feng's ideology while I was ill. I felt immense anger and wrote a short article denouncing Hu Feng's mistakes of distorting Lu Xun and being anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary. That was drafted before April, so what was published in the "Literary Gazette" issues 9 and 10 was only about drawing a line ideologically, which was far from enough. After May 10th, because I left Beijing to inspect rural areas in Hunan and Hubei provinces, I saw the two batches of materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party clique after May 13th. Only then did I realize that the activities of the Hu Feng clique were not just an ideological issue, but an organized, programmatic, command-driven, and action-oriented counter-revolutionary clique! We were too kind. The thought of a twenty-year enemy lying in ambush, having seen "insults wrapped in smiles" and "friendly handshakes" in front of me, made me feel nauseous. His "jumping official" style of hypocritical face, his constant attempts to use divisive tactics, his "I have everything" self-aggrandizing demeanor that disregarded everything, and the activities of that handful of counter-revolutionary cliques, through the materials revealing Hu Feng's sinister and ugly face, I hate him with gnashing teeth. Now, as a People's Representative, I request that the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique be investigated and punished according to the law, so that the enemy's conspiracy cannot succeed and the cause of socialist construction can be completed smoothly.

    认清胡风的真面目
    许广平
    当我二月间从国外回京，在病中读到了中国文联印发的一些有关胡风思想批判的文件，感到无比的愤怒，曾经写过短文斥责胡风歪曲鲁迅及反党反人民反革命的过错。那是在四月以前执笔，因此发表在“文艺报”第九、十号上的仅是从思想上划清界限，是很不够的。五月十日以后，又因我离京到湖南、湖北等省乡间视察，辗转看到五月十三日以后关于胡风反党集团的两批材料，才明白胡风集团的活动不仅是思想问题，而是有组织、有纲领、有指挥、有行动的反革命集团！我们太忠厚了，一想到二十年的敌人在打埋伏，在我面前也曾看到过“用微笑包着侮蔑”和我“握手言欢”，就感到恶心想吐。他那“跳加官”式的伪善面孔，那无时无刻不设法运用的挑拨手段，那“万物皆备于我”而无视一切的自大狂的神气，那一撮反革命集团的活动，通过材料所显现出胡风阴森森的丑恶嘴脸，我切齿痛恨。现在，我以人民代表的身份，请求对胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动给以追究，依法惩办，使敌人阴谋不能得逞，使社会主义建设事业得以顺利完成。
