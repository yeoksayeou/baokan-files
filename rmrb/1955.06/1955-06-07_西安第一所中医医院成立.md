Xi'an's First Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Established

Xi'an's first medical and experimental research institution for Traditional Chinese Medicine—the Xi'an Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital—officially opened on May 28th.

This hospital uses Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis, with Western medicine assistance, and treatment primarily using Chinese herbal medicine. Through clinical trials, it confirms the therapeutic effects, allowing Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment experience to be scientifically validated. The hospital has three departments: administrative, medical affairs, and research. The medical affairs department is further divided into outpatient and inpatient departments. The outpatient clinic began in mid-December 1954 and currently treats over 100 people daily, with departments of internal medicine, gynecology, and acupuncture. The inpatient department has 50 beds. The research department has four research laboratories: testing, medical records, prescriptions, and comprehensive. The research focuses primarily on local and common diseases in the Xi'an area, and has now determined to research five disease types: neurasthenia, muscular and joint rheumatism, women's dysmenorrhea, facial nerve palsy, and acute gastroenteritis.
