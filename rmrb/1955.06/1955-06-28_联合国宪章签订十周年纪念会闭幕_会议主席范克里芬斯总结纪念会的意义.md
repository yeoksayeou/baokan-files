Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, June 27th (TASS dispatch): The tenth anniversary commemorative meeting of the signing of the United Nations Charter solemnly held its final meeting on June 26th.

The meeting chairman, Van Kleffens, delivered a short speech at the beginning of the meeting.

Former presidents of the United Nations General Assembly delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting: Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Pearson, Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs Nervo, Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ardalan, Philippine delegation head Romulo, and Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Spaak.

Meeting Chairman Van Kleffens said that representatives of a large number of UN member states hoped that he would summarize the significance of the commemorative meeting at the final session. Therefore, he made the following statement:

“1. All member states participating in the commemorative meeting gathered in San Francisco on the tenth anniversary of United Nations have reaffirmed their shared determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. The ten years since June 26, 1945, have given this universal desire of the peoples of all nations new meaning and urgency; because they know that another war waged with the weapons they now possess would bring unspeakable disaster to humanity. Their goal is peace based on security, justice, and good neighborliness, in accordance with the explicit provisions of the Charter.

2. They reiterate their common commitment to the purposes and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter. They recognize that the hope for lasting peace lies in the extent to which nations implement these purposes and uphold these principles in their relations with each other.

3. They reaffirm their determination to make renewed efforts to resolve international disputes by peaceful means, as required by the United Nations Charter, so as not to endanger international peace, security, and justice, and to live together in peace and friendship.

4. They pledge to make similar efforts to find agreements on disarmament plans that can give nations greater security and free the world from the threat of atomic annihilation. They declare their firm conviction that nations are determined to divert the resources thus saved from the burden of armaments to improve the lives of people everywhere."

Van Kleffens' statement was unanimously applauded by all representatives.

The United Nations commemorative meeting concluded here.

    联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会闭幕
    会议主席范克里芬斯总结纪念会的意义
    新华社二十七日讯　塔斯社旧金山二十七日讯：六月二十六日，联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会隆重地举行了最后一次会议。
    会议主席范克里芬斯在会议开始时简短致词。
    在会议上致祝词的有联合国大会前几届会议的主席：加拿大外交部长皮尔逊、墨西哥外交部长纳孚、伊朗外交大臣安迪让、菲律宾代表团团长罗慕洛和比利时外交大臣斯巴克。
    会议主席范克里芬斯说道，很大一部分联合国会员国的代表都希望他在最后一次会议上总结纪念会的意义。因此，他作了如下发言：
    “一、在联合国成立十周年聚集在旧金山的参加纪念会的全体会员国都重申了它们欲免后世再遭战祸的共同决心。一九四五年六月二十六日以来的十个年头已经使各国人民这个普遍的愿望具有了新的意义和紧迫性；因为他们知道，用现在他们所掌握的武器进行的另一次大战将会给人类带来惨不堪言的灾祸。他们的目的是按照宪章明白的条文以安全、正义和善邻之道为基础的和平。
    二、他们再次宣布他们共同忠实于联合国宪章所规定的宗旨和原则。他们认识到，持久和平的希望在于各国在它们彼此的关系中贯彻这些宗旨和维护这些原则到什么程度。
    三、他们重申他们决心要作出新的努力依照联合国宪章的要求以和平方法解决国际争端，俾免危及国际和平、安全及正义，并和平和友谊地相处。
    四、他们保证要同样地努力寻找能够使各国有较大程度的安全并使世界不受原子毁灭威胁的裁军计划的协议。他们宣布他们深信各国决心把这样从军备负担方面节省下来的资力移用来改善各地人民的生活。”
    范克里芬斯的这一发言得到全体代表一致鼓掌赞同。
    联合国纪念会到此闭幕。
