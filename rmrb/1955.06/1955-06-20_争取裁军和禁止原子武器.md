    Striving for Disarmament and Banning Atomic Weapons
    Wan Guang
    The World Peace Congress will open in Helsinki on June 22nd. According to the suggestion of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, this conference will mainly discuss the most urgent current issues, one of which is the issue of disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons.
    This issue has been of universal concern to peace-loving people around the world. Because this issue concerns world peace and security, and the lives of people in all countries. The ruling groups of some countries, led by the United States, pursue a "policy of strength" and expand their military to prepare for a new world war. They brandish atomic weapons and openly formulate atomic war plans, which puts the international situation in a state of tension and threatens the peace and security of people in all countries. In those countries, the people are also suffocated by the heavy burden of armaments. The people demand the elimination of the threat of a new war and to live peaceful lives; disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons are a fundamental measure in this regard. If all countries, especially the major powers, can agree to implement disarmament and ban atomic weapons, it will greatly improve the international situation and relations between countries. At the same time, this will also greatly reduce the burden of armaments on the people of all countries and transfer useful property from the manufacture of weapons of destruction to peaceful construction and the welfare of the people.
    For several years, the arms race in Western countries has already brought serious consequences to the economies and daily lives of people in many countries in the capitalist world. A large amount of money and wealth is used for non-productive military consumption. In the past five years, from the fiscal year 1949-50 to 1954-55, the direct military expenditure of the United States has increased more than threefold, the United Kingdom has increased nearly twofold, and France has increased nearly three and a half times. As a result, the tax burden and debt of the people have been greatly increased. The taxes paid by the American people increased by 70 percent during the same period, and at the beginning of this year, their total private debt increased by almost double. This shows what the disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet Union mean for the vast number of people in the capitalist world who live in the plight of high prices, poverty, shortage of housing and schools, and lack of medical and welfare security. According to statistics, if the new disarmament proposal put forward by the Soviet Union on May 10 this year is implemented, the money reduced from the French military budget would be enough to produce an additional four million tons of coal, 69,000 fifteen-horsepower tractors, 600 million bottles of milk, and 750,000 bicycles every year. It can also build 60,000 three-room houses, 1,600 schools, and 18,000 kilometers of roads. If the Soviet Union's proposal on reducing armed forces is implemented, the United States can reduce taxes by 14 billion to 20 billion US dollars annually due to reduced appropriations for maintaining the army, navy, and air force. The increased income for residents would be enough to buy half more food. As everyone knows, due to increased taxes, inflation, and other reasons, the consumption of some staple foods such as butter by the American people is much lower than before the war. In the United Kingdom, taxes can be reduced by 300 million pounds, which can build at least 300,000 three-room houses every year, to a certain extent solving the housing shortage problem that ordinary Britons are currently very troubled by.
    What the people want is peaceful construction and progress. The Soviet Union's achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy have already revealed the vision of a new scientific era for mankind. Now, people in all countries are more urgently demanding the banning of atomic weapons, so that the great discoveries about atomic energy are not used for destruction, but are entirely used to benefit mankind.
    All this shows why disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons have always been one of the main goals of the peace movement in all countries of the world, and why thousands upon thousands of people around the world continue to participate in the struggle for disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons. Especially since this year, this movement has become even stronger.
    In January of this year, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council passed the "Appeal to the People of the World," opposing the preparation for atomic war, advocating the destruction of all stored atomic weapons, and immediately stopping the manufacture of atomic weapons. The movement to sign this "Appeal to the People of the World" has been vigorously carried out in many countries around the world. More than 400 million people in China have signed it. In many countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe, the public from a wide range of classes has participated in the signature movement, and some government ministers, members of parliament, and well-known social activists have also signed. Within the United States, the voices of many trade union organizations, public groups, and religious groups demanding disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons are also becoming louder and louder.
    Peace-loving countries have recently been making further efforts to seek solutions to the issue of disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries solemnly guaranteed in the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed in Warsaw that they will strive to take effective measures for universal disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction by reaching agreements with other countries willing to cooperate. This effort is fully supported by the People's Republic of China.
    The Bandung Conference of twenty-nine countries in Asia and Africa also unanimously passed a resolution calling on the main relevant countries to promote disarmament and the banning of weapons of mass destruction.
    Now, the demand for disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons has formed a powerful political and moral force in the world. From the reaction of Western countries' bourgeois rhetoric to the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals, it can be seen that Western governments now feel that they can no longer completely ignore the people's strong demands. Some "policy of strength" adherents have also expressed their approval of reducing armaments. But people cannot fail to notice that they are deliberately spreading pessimism about the prospect of a substantial solution to the disarmament issue. For example, US Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference on June 7 that the disarmament issue "is very complex and intricate," and he "fears that even with the greatest of goodwill, it will take a considerable period of time to find a solution." Hidden behind this pessimistic tone is a conspiracy to use the smoke screen of advocating disarmament to cover up the Western countries' continued arms expansion and war preparations.
    It is true that the disarmament issue is a complex issue involving many aspects, but as long as Western countries show sincerity and do not merely talk about disarmament while actually trying to obstruct disarmament, there is now an open road to solving this issue. The United Nations has been discussing this issue for several years without a solution, not because a solution cannot be found, but because Western countries, led by the United States, have not only lacked the "greatest of goodwill" to solve this issue, but have not even had the slightest goodwill. The Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward solutions in the United Nations, while Western countries have been working hard to oppose them one after another.
    Now, the new disarmament proposal put forward by the Soviet Union on May 10 provides a new, huge, and realistic opportunity for reaching an agreement. Starting from the current international reality, the Soviet Union proposes to take a number of measures to end the "Cold War" and promote mutual trust between countries to create the necessary conditions for the implementation of a broad disarmament program. In order to ensure an early solution to the controversial issues, the Soviet Union has put forward new specific plans for disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons, and has put forward practical and feasible ways to conduct effective international supervision of disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons. Even newspapers like the British "News Chronicle" said in commenting on the Soviet proposals that this proposal "offers the greatest hope of reaching agreement on this confused and distressing issue."
    However, the United States and its British and French allies have suspended the work of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee indefinitely, and have tried their best to evade discussing the Soviet proposals. Therefore, people see that those who emphasize the "difficulty" of solving the disarmament issue are actually creating difficulties for every solution.
    It must be pointed out that the United States' insistence on opposing the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China, one of the world's major powers, in the discussion of the disarmament issue is also a clear manifestation of the United States obstructing the actual discussion and solution of this issue.
    The facts show that the US ruling group does not want disarmament at all, and they attempt to continue to pursue the aggressive policy of expanding armaments and preparing for atomic war. Some recent remarks by senior US officials have made this very clear. For example, the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, US General Gruenther, said on May 19 that the idea of banning atomic weapons is an "absurd idea." On May 27, he also said that if the allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization stumbled in the "final stage" of military preparations, it would be a "sad thing." US Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Strauss publicly announced that the United States is prepared to step up the manufacture of atomic weapons and increase the storage of various atomic weapons. US Secretary of Defense Wilson also publicly assured American monopoly capitalists that the US armed forces and military spending will be maintained at their current huge levels for a long time, and the US government's military orders will not be reduced.
    The forces of war have felt the enormous pressure of the people, but they are still stubbornly resisting. This requires peace-loving people in all countries to maintain high vigilance and make greater efforts. The power of the people is endless. As long as the people continue to mobilize greater strength and carry out unremitting struggles, they can have a decisive impact on the governments that still adhere to the "policy of strength."
    Due to the series of steps taken by the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries to ease international tensions, there is now a favorable opportunity to make progress in resolving international disputes. The four-nation summit conference, which has been interrupted for ten years, will be held in Geneva in July. The public in all countries must cooperate closely and unite to stop the sabotage conspiracies of the forces of war and to promote the solution of pressing issues in international life such as disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons.
    This is the task before the World Peace Congress. The representatives of the public from all walks of life participating in the conference will surely make important contributions in this regard through free discussion.

    争取裁军和禁止原子武器
    万光
    世界和平大会六月二十二日将在赫尔辛基开幕了。根据世界和平理事会常务委员会的建议，这次大会主要将讨论当前最紧要的问题，其中之一是裁军和禁止原子武器问题。
    这个问题一直是世界各国爱好和平的人民所普遍关切的。因为，这个问题关系着世界和平和安全，关系着各国人民的生活。以美国为首的一些国家统治集团奉行“实力政策”，扩张军备来准备新的世界战争，他们挥舞着原子武器，并且公开制定着原子战争计划，使得国际局势处于紧张状态，各国人民的和平和安全受到威胁。在那些国家里，人民还被沉重的军备负担压得喘不过气来。人民要求消除新战争的威胁，过和平的生活；裁军和禁止原子武器是这方面的一个根本性措施。各国，首先是各大国如果能够协议实行裁军和禁止原子武器，就能大大地改善国际局势和国与国之间的关系。同时，这也将大大地减轻各国人民的军备负担，并把有用的财产从制造以毁灭为目的的武器转移到和平建设和人民的福利上来。
    几年来，西方国家的军备竞赛已经给资本主义世界许多国家的经济和人民日常生活带来了严重的后果。大量金钱和财富用在非生产性的军备消耗上，在过去五年中，从一九四九—五○年度到一九五四—五五年度，以直接军事开支来说，美国增加了三倍多，英国增加了近两倍，法国增加了近三倍半。结果是人民的捐税负担和债务大大加重了。美国人民缴纳的捐税同时期内增加了百分之七十，在今年初，他们的私人债务总额增加了差不多一倍。由此可见，对于生活在物价高涨、贫困、短缺住屋和学校、没有医疗和福利保障的困境之中的资本主义世界广大人民来说，苏联提出的裁军建议意味着什么。据统计，如果实行了苏联今年五月十日提出的裁军新建议，从法国军事预算中缩减出来的钱，就足够每年多出产四百万吨煤，六万九千台十五匹马力的拖拉机，六亿瓶牛奶，七十五万辆自行车，还可以建筑六万所三个房间的住宅，一千六百所学校，一万八千公里的公路。如果实行了苏联关于裁减武装部队的建议，美国由于减少维持海陆空军方面拨款每年可以减少赋税一百四十亿至二百亿美元，居民因此增加的收入款项足够多买一半的粮食；而大家知道，由于捐税增加和通货膨胀等等原因，美国人民现在一些主食如牛油之类的消费量远比战前为低。在英国，可以减少赋税三亿英镑，这笔款项每年至少可以建造三十万所三个房间的住宅，在一定程度上解决普通英国人目前十分感到烦恼的房荒问题。
    人民愿望的是和平建设和进步。苏联在和平利用原子能方面的成就，已经给人类揭开了一个新的科学时代的远景。现在，各国人民更加迫切地要求禁止原子武器，使关于原子能的伟大发现不被用于毁灭和破坏，而完全用来造福人类。
    这些都说明，为什么裁军和禁止原子武器一直是世界各国和平运动奋斗的主要目标之一，为什么世界各地不断有成千成万的人们参加进争取裁军和禁止原子武器的斗争的行列中来。特别是今年以来，这个运动是更加壮大了。
    今年一月，世界和平理事会常务委员会通过了“告全世界人民书”，反对准备原子战争，主张毁掉储存的全部原子武器，并且立即停止制造原子武器。在这个“告全世界人民书”上签名的运动已经在世界上许多国家里蓬勃开展了。中国有四亿多人签了名。在亚洲、拉丁美洲和欧洲许多国家里，广泛阶层的公众参加了签名运动，有些政府的部长、议会议员、著名社会活动家也签了名。在美国国内，许多工会组织、公众团体、宗教团体要求裁军和禁止原子武器的声音也越来越响亮了。
    爱好和平的国家最近正进一步努力来谋求解决裁军和禁止原子武器问题。苏联和东欧人民民主国家在华沙签订的友好合作互助条约中庄严地保证，它们将努力争取通过同其他愿意合作的国家取得协议的办法，来采取普遍裁军和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的有效措施。这种努力受到中华人民共和国的完全支持。
    亚洲和非洲二十九个国家万隆会议也一致通过了呼吁主要有关国家促进裁军和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的决议。
    现在，要求裁军和禁止原子武器已经在世界上形成一股强大的政治和道义上的力量。从西方国家资产阶级言论对苏联新裁军建议的反应可以看出，西方国家政府现在也感到再不能把人民的这种强烈要求完全置之不理了。一些“实力政策”奉行者也表示起赞成裁减军备来了。但是人们不能不注意到他们对裁军问题的实质性解决的前景故意散布悲观空气。例如，美国国务卿杜勒斯六月七日在记者招待会上说，裁军问题“是很复杂和错综的”，他“担心即使有最大的意愿，也需要一个相当长的时期才能求得一个解决办法。”在这种悲观论调后面隐藏着的是一种想利用主张裁军的烟幕来掩护西方国家继续扩军备战的阴谋。
    不错，裁军问题是牵涉到许多方面的错综复杂的问题，但是只要西方国家表现诚意，不是空谈裁军而实际上竭力阻挠裁军，这个问题现在有着敞开着的解决的道路。联合国几年来一直在讨论这个问题而没有得到解决，并不是由于找不到解决这个问题的办法，而是以美国为首的西方国家一直不但缺乏解决这个问题的“最大的意愿”，连最小的意愿也没有过。苏联在联合国里一再地提出过解决方案，而西方国家所努力的只是设法一个又一个加以反对。
    现在，苏联五月十日提出的裁军新建议为达成协议提供了新的、巨大的、现实的机会。苏联从当前国际现实出发，建议采取若干结束“冷战”和促进国与国之间相互信任的措施，来给实现广泛的裁军方案创造必要的条件。苏联为了保证尽早解决引起争论的问题，提出了裁军和禁止原子武器的新的具体方案，并且提出了对裁军和禁止原子武器进行有效国际监督的切实可行的办法。连英国“新闻记事报”这样的报纸在评论苏联建议时也说，这个建议“使这
  一纷乱而苦恼的问题有了取得协议的最大希望”。
    但是，美国和它的英法盟友却无限期地中断了联合国裁军小组委员会的工作，竭力规避讨论苏联建议。因此人们看到，强调解决裁军问题“困难”的人，实际上正在为每一个解决办法制造着困难。
    必须指出，美国坚持反对世界大国之一——中华人民共和国代表参加关于裁军问题的讨论，也是美国阻挠实际讨论和解决这个问题的明显的表现。
    事实表明，美国统治集团根本不想裁军，他们企图继续奉行扩张军备和准备原子战争的侵略政策。有一些美国高级官员最近的言论说得很清楚。例如，北大西洋集团军队总司令、美国将军格仑瑟五月十九日说，禁止原子武器这种主张是“荒诞的想法”。他在五月二十七日又说，如果北大西洋集团的盟国在军事准备的“最后阶段”绊住了脚，那将是“可悲的事”。美国政府原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯则公开宣布，美国准备加紧制造原子武器，增加储存各种各样的原子武器。美国国防部长威尔逊也公开向美国垄断资本家们保证，美国武装部队和军事开支将长时期保持在目前庞大的水平上，美国政府军事订货不会减少。
    战争势力已经感受到人民的巨大压力，但仍然在顽抗着。这就要求各国爱好和平人们保持高度的警惕，作更大的努力。人民的力量是无穷无尽的，只要人民不断动员出更大的力量，坚持不懈地进行斗争，是能够对目前还坚持奉行着“实力政策”的政府发生决定性的影响的。
    由于苏联、中国等爱好和平国家主动地采取了
  一系列缓和国际紧张局势的步骤，目前出现了在解决国际争端上取得进展的有利时机。中断了十年之久的四国政府首脑会议七月间将在日内瓦举行。各国公众必须紧密地合作，团结一致地来制止战争势力的破坏阴谋，来促进裁军和禁止原子武器等这些国际生活里迫切的问题的解决。
    这就是摆在世界和平大会面前的任务。参加大会的各国广泛阶层公众的代表通过自由讨论，一定会在这方面作出重要的贡献。
