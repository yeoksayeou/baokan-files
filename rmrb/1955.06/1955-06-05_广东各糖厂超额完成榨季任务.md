Guangdong's state-owned, Guangdong local state-owned, and joint state-private owned forty-one sugar factories have successively exceeded their production targets for the 1954-1955 sugar season by the end of April and May. Due to the expanded sugarcane planting area in various parts of Guangdong in 1954 and further improvements in sugarcane quality, the sugar factories obtained more sufficient raw materials. The output of white granulated sugar and brown sugar produced by the factories increased by more than 77,600 metric tons compared to the previous season. To ensure the completion of the state plan, all factories strengthened their technical management work more than in 1954. Workers put forward many rationalization proposals in labor competitions, promoted advanced experiences and advanced operating methods, overcame difficulties, and improved production technology. Many sugar factories paid attention to conservation, reduced costs, and strived to improve labor productivity.

    广东各糖厂超额完成榨季任务
    广东国营、广东地方国营和公私合营四十一个糖厂，已经在四月底五月间先后超额完成了榨季一九五四—一九五五年的生产任务。由于广东各地在一九五四年扩大了种蔗面积，进一步改善了甘蔗的规格，使各糖厂获得较充足的原料。各糖厂生产的白砂糖、赤砂糖比上季共增产了七万七千六百多公吨。各厂为了保证完成国家计划，都比一九五四年加强了技术管理工作，工人在劳动竞赛中提出许多合理化建议，推广先进经验和先进操作法，克服困难，提高了生产技术。许多糖厂都注意节约，降低成本，并努力提高劳动生产率。
