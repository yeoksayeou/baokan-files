Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, June 21st. This afternoon, members of the Indian Cultural Delegation enjoyed a pleasant cruise around the beautiful Dalian harbor on two motorboats, after which they visited the Dalian Shipbuilding Company.

　　As the motorboats smoothly sailed to the center of the harbor, they saw tall cranes standing at the various docks, tirelessly swinging their iron arms to load and unload various goods. The high-speed mechanized equipment at each port won the praise of the Indian guests.

　　The distinguished guests cruised on the sea for more than an hour. On the motorboats, they chatted and exchanged autographs with their Chinese friends. The young ballet dancer, N. Swami, showed a delicate booklet to a Chinese friend with whom he was chatting, pointing to many pages with signatures and messages from Chinese friends, saying: "I will keep this booklet as a souvenir of my visit to China."

　　Next, the delegation members visited the Dalian Shipbuilding Company. The company's manager, Yuan Xianqian, warmly received the guests. Upon meeting them, he kindly said to the Indian artists: "Last night, I was fortunate enough to enjoy your artistic performance. Every program was performed very well, and I wanted to keep watching it."

　　Yuan Xianqian accompanied the Indian Cultural Delegation members on a detailed tour of the shipbuilding and ship repair production processes. Head of Delegation Chanda and his wife, etc., toured a newly built 3,700-ton oil barge, from the deck all the way to the bottom hold. They also went up to the bridge of the new ship to view the entire company.

　　In the afternoon, dancer K. Kutti taught Kathakali dance to dance workers from various Chinese art troupes who were sent to learn with the delegation. Yesterday, he had already enthusiastically given his "students" their "first lesson."

    印度文化代表团人员航游大连海港
    新华社旅大二十一日电　二十一日下午，印度文化代表团人员乘坐两艘汽艇愉快地航游了美丽的大连海港，以后又参观了大连造船公司。
    当汽艇平稳地驶到港湾的中央时，他们看到了各个码头上林立的高大起重机正在不停地挥舞铁臂装卸着各种货物，各个港口的高速机械化设备博得了印度客人们的称赞。
    贵宾们在海上航游了一个多小时，在汽艇上，他们和中国朋友尽情地交谈和互相签名留念。小巴蕾舞舞蹈家纳·斯瓦米把一本精致的小册子翻给和他畅谈的一位中国朋友看，并指着许多页上中国朋友的签名和留言说：我要把这个小册子留作访问中国的纪念。
    接着，代表团人员参观了大连造船公司。公司的经理原宪千热情地接待了客人，他一见面就很亲切地对印度艺术家们说：昨天晚上，我幸运地欣赏了你们的艺术表演。每个节目表演得都很好，使我看了还想看。
    原宪千陪同印度文化代表团人员详细地参观了造船和修船的生产过程。钱达团长和夫人等在新建的一艘三千七百吨的油驳船上，从甲板一直参观到底舱，他们还登上了这艘新船的天桥，瞻望了这个公司的全貌。
    下午，舞蹈家克·库蒂向中国各艺术团体派来随团学习的舞蹈工作者们教卡达卡利舞。昨天，他已热情地向他的“学生们”上了“第一课”。
