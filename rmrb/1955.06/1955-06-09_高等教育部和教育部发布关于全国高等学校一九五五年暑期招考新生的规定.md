The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China issued regulations on June 8 regarding the national college entrance examination for new students in the summer of 1955.

This year, with the exception of ethnic, music, fine arts, drama, and Renmin University of China, national higher education institutions will implement a unified central plan, with provinces (cities) organizing and leading, and higher education institutions participating, and basically take the original major administrative regions as the scope to conduct unified enrollment. The regulations point out that college entrance examination is the primary step for higher education institutions to ensure the implementation of the state's cadre training plan. In order to meet the needs of the country's socialist construction for various specialized construction talents, this year's national college enrollment should resolutely correct the past few years' tendency to pay more attention to quantity and less attention to quality. Strictly select and admit qualified new students from three aspects: politics, health, and cultural and scientific knowledge. It is necessary to implement the requirements of ensuring quality and taking care of quantity. Pay attention to the students' wishes, school characteristics, and regional convenience, and encourage students with conditions to commute.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of the unified college entrance examination, the regulations require all provinces (cities) to strengthen their leadership over the unified college entrance examination. Any province (city) or autonomous region with examination areas, the education department (bureau, ministry) of the province (city) or autonomous region should, together with relevant departments and higher education institutions within the province (city) or autonomous region, establish a college enrollment work committee to carry out work. National higher education institutions should attach importance to enrollment work and be fully responsible for enrollment work. Higher education institutions have the responsibility to select qualified cadres to participate in various tasks according to the needs of the enrollment work committees at all levels. From the preparation of enrollment work to registration, examination, paper grading, review, admission, and registration, higher education institutions should be specifically responsible under the leadership of the regional and provincial (city) and autonomous region enrollment work committees. During admission, the school should decide to admit students applying to the school according to the admission method and in conjunction with the school's requirements.

The regulations determine that the unified national college entrance examination time is from July 15 to 18 (the start and end dates for application registration will be separately stipulated by the regional enrollment work committee).

The enrollment examination is set up in the following examination areas:

    North China: Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Yuncheng
    Northeast China: Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Jinzhou, Qiqihar, Yanji, Siping, Lushun-Dalian, Mudanjiang, Liaoyang
    East China: Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Jinhua, Jinan, Qingdao, Hefei, Wuhu, Anqing, Bengbu, Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou
    Central South China: Wuhan, Xiangyang, Yichang, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Xinyang, Nanyang, Changsha, Hengyang, Shaoyang, Changde, Yuanling, Guangzhou, Haikou, Meixian, Shantou, Zhanjiang, Guilin, Nanning, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Yulin, Nanchang, Ji'an, Ganzhou, Shangrao
    Southwest China: Chongqing, Wanxian, Nanchong, Chengdu, Neijiang, Luzhou, Ya'an, Guiyang, Kunming, Dali
    Northwest China: Xi'an, Nanzheng, Lanzhou, Urumqi
    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: Ulanhot, Hohhot

The regional, provincial (city), and autonomous region college enrollment work committees may decide to add examination areas and examination halls in addition to the above locations to take care of the convenience of candidates.

Regarding the conditions for recruiting new students, the regulations stipulate that any citizen of the People's Republic of China who meets one of the following conditions may apply for the examination:

    (1) Current graduates of senior high schools and worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools holding graduation certificates.
    (2) Current graduates of secondary specialized schools who have been approved by the original school to be promoted to higher education according to the quota allocated by the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education in conjunction with relevant departments, and who hold graduation certificates and introduction letters from the school.
    (3) State workers in institutions, enterprises, schools, and organizations who have a cultural level equivalent to that of senior high school graduates and hold introduction letters from their work units.
    (4) Demobilized construction soldiers and transferred soldiers who have a cultural level equivalent to that of senior high school graduates and hold introduction letters from the transfer and construction committees above the county (district of large and medium-sized cities) of their place of origin, or from units of the regimental level or equivalent of the troops.
    (5) Returned overseas Chinese students who have a high school graduation cultural level and hold a certificate from domestic overseas Chinese affairs agencies.
    (6) Students from Hong Kong and Macau who hold a certificate from the Guangzhou "Hong Kong and Macau High School Graduates Returning to Guangzhou for Further Education Guidance Committee."
    (7) Non-working and non-studying social youth who have graduated from high school or have confirmed through self-study that they have a cultural level equivalent to that of a high school graduate, are under the age of twenty-seven, and hold a high school graduation certificate (referring to those who have graduated from high school) and an introduction letter from the district or above people's committee of their area.

Applicants should, during the prescribed period, undergo a health check-up at a designated hospital in accordance with the "National College Enrollment Health Examination Method" issued by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Ministry of Education. The health check-up should be regarded as one of the important conditions for admitting new students.

In order to facilitate the enrollment work, the regulations stipulate that applicants in areas where there are examination areas (i.e., graduating schools, work units, or permanent household registration locations) are only allowed to apply for the examination in this examination area; applicants in areas where there are no examination areas should apply for the examination in a nearby examination area. Students from Hong Kong and Macau should apply for the examination in Guangzhou.

Current graduates of senior high schools and worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools and current graduates of secondary specialized schools who have been approved to be promoted to higher education may adopt the method of collective application registration.

In order to further adapt to the different requirements of various majors in higher education for candidates' academic level, this year's examination subjects are stipulated as follows:

    (1) Examination subjects for various majors in engineering, science (including science for teachers), and agricultural and forestry sciences, such as agricultural production mechanization, forest harvesting and transportation mechanization, wood mechanical processing, and water conservancy and soil improvement: Chinese language, political common sense, mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
    (2) Examination subjects for various majors in medicine, agricultural and forestry sciences, biological sciences (including biology departments for teachers), psychology, sports, and other majors: Chinese language, political common sense, the basics of Darwinism, chemistry, and physics.
    (3) Examination subjects for various majors in liberal arts, history, political science and law (including liberal arts, history, political science, and education for teachers), and economics and finance: Chinese language, political common sense, history, and geography.

Applicants for music and art subjects in higher normal schools should take the (3) category subjects in addition to taking relevant professional subjects.

Since the source of candidates in the North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China regions is small and insufficient to meet the enrollment needs of higher education institutions in this region, the regulations stipulate that applicants in the above regions are allowed to apply for a few designated schools in other regions, but the principle is to apply for schools in this region. The source of students in the East China, Central South China, and Southwest China regions is large, exceeding the enrollment needs of higher education institutions in this region. Applicants in the above regions, in addition to applying for schools in this region, can apply for schools in the North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China regions. Applicants in the East China, Central South China, and Southwest China regions generally may not transfer to each other, unless there are special circumstances and approved by the examination area where they are located. Individual applicants who have expertise and whose desired major is not available in higher education institutions in their area may apply for higher education institutions in relevant areas with the approval of the examination area where they are located.

Regarding students' application preferences, the regulations stipulate that the preference should be based on major (or major category) combined with school preference, and applicants should choose realistically based on their specific conditions and interests. Higher education institutions should, according to national needs, select and admit applicants who are qualified in terms of political and health conditions and examination results, with reference to the filled-in preferences. Candidates who meet the political and health conditions and whose examination results are slightly lower than the admission standards may be admitted as probationary students when the school has vacancies. The probationary period is stipulated as one semester or one academic year, which is determined by the relevant higher education institution. Those who cannot attend classes during the probationary period will have their probationary status revoked; those who pass the examination after the probationary period will be transferred to formal students. Graduates of worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools and those who meet one of the following conditions should be given priority for admission when their examination results reach the admission standards for the major they are applying for, and when their scores are the same or similar to those of general applicants.

    (1) Industrial workers in industrial departments such as factories, mines, and farms;
    (2) Children of workers and peasants, and cadres of worker and peasant origin;
    (3) Demobilized construction soldiers and transferred soldiers;
    (4) Ethnic minority students;
    (5) Overseas Chinese students.

The regulations stipulate that in-service cadres who have worked for a full three years, and who are admitted to school with proof from their original work unit, may enjoy the treatment of people's scholarships for transferred cadres. General students who have financial difficulties at home or have no source of income may apply to the school for people's scholarships after enrollment. Students in higher normal schools are generally given people's scholarships. (Xinhua News Agency)
