"New China" Brand Tires are of Very Poor Quality

To the Editor:

This year, the spring Yellow River repair task in the Liaocheng Special District of Shandong Province is very large. Before this spring repair, we vigorously organized the masses to purchase 8,000 rubber-wheeled carts, about half of which used "New China" brand tires, to undertake the soil transportation work for the Yellow River spring repair. In order to better maintain and use these rubber-wheeled carts, the levee repair headquarters at all levels conducted a series of technical operation guidance work for the laborers.

Unexpectedly, only twenty-odd days after the construction started, "New China" brand tires began to be damaged in large numbers. At first, we thought that the laborers had not taken good care of the vehicles, but later we found that more and more tires were damaged, and we felt that it was not a maintenance problem. As of May 8th, according to incomplete statistics from four counties in the district, more than 1,900 tires had been damaged, all of which were "New China" brand, accounting for about 40% of the total number of existing "New China" brand tires. This large number of tire damage incidents has seriously damaged the interests of the laborers and affected the smooth progress of the project.

After we discovered the tire damage in mid-April, we immediately reported it to the Provincial River Affairs Bureau. On April 30th, the Provincial River Affairs Bureau and the Department Store sent people to the construction site for a preliminary inspection. On May 5th, the engineer, section chief, and technician from the Qingdao State-owned No. 2 Rubber Factory, which produces "New China" brand tires, together with staff from the Department Store and Section Chief Dong from the Provincial River Affairs Bureau, came to various counties in our district for inspection. They inspected and understood the damage to the tires and the use of rubber-wheeled carts, and held discussions. Comrade Duan from the Department Store believed that the main problem was the quality of the tires, because the road paving was very flat and the load on the rubber-wheeled carts did not exceed the specified limits. However, the comrades from the Rubber Factory said vaguely: this is both a quality problem and an operational problem; but they did not specifically explain where the problem lies.

It should be mentioned that the tires used by the laborers in our district also include "Camel" brand and "National Defense" brand tires. Under the same conditions of use, the tires of other brands have not been damaged, only the "New China" brand tires have been damaged. For example, in the 34 rubber-wheeled cart teams of the 5th District of Shou'er Section, there are a total of 604 rubber-wheeled carts. Team One of Yanglidi Kou Village used "New China" brand tires, and seventeen out of twenty-five have been found to be damaged. The tires used by other teams are not "New China" brand, and not a single one has been damaged. "New China" brand tires are more expensive than other brands, but they break down very quickly. What is the reason for this? The Qingdao State-owned No. 2 Rubber Factory should conduct an inspection.

### 新中国牌的轮胎质量很坏

    新中国牌的轮胎质量很坏编辑同志：
    山东省聊城专区今年黄河春修任务很大。今年春修前，我们大力组织群众贷买了胶轮车八千多辆，轮胎用新中国牌的占一半左右，准备担任黄河春修的运土工作。为了更好地养护和使用这批胶轮车，各级复堤指挥部对民工进行了一系列的技术操作指导工作。
    不料，施工开始才二十几天，新中国牌的轮胎就开始大批损坏了。起初我们还以为是民工没有很好爱护车辆，后来发现损坏的轮胎越来越多，感觉到不是养护使用问题。到五月八日为止，全区四个县据不完全统计已坏了一千九百多个轮胎，全是新中国牌的，占现有新中国牌轮胎总数的百分之四十左右。这种大量损坏轮胎的事件，已经严重地损害了民工的利益，影响了工程的顺利进行。
    我们在四月中旬发现轮胎损坏的情况后，立即报告省河务局。四月三十日，省河务局和百货公司派人到工地进行了初步检查。五月五日，生产新中国牌轮胎的青岛国营第二橡胶厂派了工程师、科长、技术员会同百货公司的工作人员和省河务局的董科长又来我专区各县进行检查。他们察看和了解了损坏的轮胎和胶轮车的使用情况，并进行座谈。百货公司段同志认为主要是轮胎的质量问题，因为铺路板很平，胶轮车载重也没超过规定。但橡胶厂的同志笼统地说：这既是质量问题，也是操作问题；但是却没有具体说明问题究竟在什么地方。
    应该提到的是，我区民工用的轮胎，还有骆驼牌和国防牌的，在一样的条件下使用，别的牌子的轮胎都没坏，单单是新中国牌的坏了。如寿二段五区三十四个胶轮车队，共有胶轮车六百零四辆，杨李堤口村一队用的是新中国牌的轮胎，二十五个已发现坏了十七个，其他队用的轮胎不是新中国牌的，就一个没坏。新中国牌的轮胎价钱比别的牌子都贵，而坏得却很快，这究竟是什么原因呢？青岛国营第二橡胶厂应该进行检查。
