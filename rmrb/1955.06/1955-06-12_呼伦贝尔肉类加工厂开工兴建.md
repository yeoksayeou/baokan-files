    Hulunbuir Meat Processing Plant Begins Construction
    On June 6th, in the suburbs of Hailar, a city on the grasslands, the state-owned Hulunbuir League Meat Joint Processing Plant commenced construction. This is one of China's meat processing plants with advanced equipment and a large production volume. This plant, under the leadership of the Ministry of Commerce and designed with the assistance of Soviet experts, is divided into slaughtering and freezing sections, both equipped with modern machinery. The entire process, from slaughtering, skinning, dismembering, washing, quarantine, and finally sending a cow into the freezer, takes only about ten minutes. According to the plant's equipment, it can slaughter one hundred and eighty head of cattle and one thousand two hundred sheep in eight hours. The plant is expected to begin production at the end of this year. By then, large quantities of cattle and sheep produced on the Inner Mongolian grasslands can be processed into frozen meat at this nearby factory. In addition to supplying part of the product for domestic consumption, the majority will be exported.

    呼伦贝尔肉类加工厂开工兴建
    在草原上的城市海拉尔郊区，国营呼伦贝尔盟肉类联合加工厂已经在六月六日开工兴建。这是我国设备先进，生产量很大的肉类加工厂之一。这个厂是在商业部领导下并由苏联专家帮助设计的，厂内分屠宰和冷冻两部分，都是现代化的机械装备。一头牛由屠宰、剥皮、解体、水洗、检疫最后送入冷冻室，全部过程只需要十来分钟。根据这个厂的设备，八小时可屠宰一百八十头牛和一千二百只羊。这个厂预计在今年年底开始生产。到时，内蒙古草原上出产的大批牛羊，可以就近在这个工厂加工制成冻肉。产品除一部分供应国内人民食用以外，大部分将出口。
