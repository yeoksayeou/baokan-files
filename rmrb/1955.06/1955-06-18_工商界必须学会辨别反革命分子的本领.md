I have read the first and second batches of materials exposed in the "People's Daily" regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, and I can no longer suppress the anger in my heart. Now, the publication of the third batch of materials has aroused even greater anger in me.

The third batch of materials further peels away Hu Feng's "sheepskin," completely exposing his hideous face. Hu Feng and his gang of counter-revolutionary black sheep were originally people with ulterior motives. They were long ago loyal lackeys of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and they had close ties with imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies. Hu Feng and his ilk were consistent anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary enemies hidden among our people. They wore the cloak of Marxism, employed double-dealing tactics, and lurked within the people for a long time, spreading bacterial toxins everywhere, deceiving the masses, gaining the trust of the people, and engaging in counter-revolutionary conspiracies. The methods of this gang of counter-revolutionary black sheep are truly vicious and despicable!

After reading the first and second batches of materials, although I had already realized that Hu Feng was long-term, consistently, and unscrupulously opposing the Chinese Communist Party, opposing the Chinese people, and opposing the Chinese revolution, I still thought that Hu Feng had painstakingly organized his group in an attempt to abolish the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party on the literary front, vainly hoping to "seize the banner" of literary leadership to achieve the arrogant and shameless goals of his personal ambition. After reading the third batch of materials, I realized that such a thought was too naive. Now, we understand more clearly that the Hu Feng group is not a simple "literary" group, but a counter-revolutionary political group with "literature" as a cover and close ties to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang; they are not simply attempting to seize leadership on the literary front, but to thoroughly undermine our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, so they hate all people's revolutionary forces, and they want the Chinese people's revolutionary regime led by the Communist Party to "perish in utter defeat." We absolutely cannot tolerate these incorrigible counter-revolutionaries any longer, and we absolutely cannot be indifferent any longer. Our people must thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. Our people must resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries.

Our industry and commerce must unite, together with the people of the whole country, under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to fight for the thorough eradication of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. Our industry and commerce must also learn from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incident, strengthen learning, and increase vigilance a hundredfold. It must be recognized that as our country advances on the socialist road, counter-revolutionaries will inevitably carry out more destructive activities. In the process of accepting socialist transformation, our industry and commerce often focus on individual and local interests, neglecting the overall interests of the country, which makes it easy for counter-revolutionaries to take advantage of loopholes and give them the opportunity to carry out conspiracies of rumor-mongering, slander, and incitement. It must also be recognized that all counter-revolutionaries and groups, their methods, and their conspiracies are very vicious, very insidious, and very difficult to detect. They will use every available opportunity to mix into our people's ranks, and they will inevitably mix into our industry and commerce ranks. Therefore, our industry and commerce must sincerely obey the leadership of the working class, unite around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, actively accept socialist transformation, and strengthen learning at all times, improve understanding, distinguish right from wrong, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and learn to be good at distinguishing the abilities of counter-revolutionaries, and fight to the end to smash all the conspiracies and destructive activities of enemies at home and abroad. This is what every patriotic industrialist and businessman should resolutely do.

    工商界必须学会辨别反革命分子的本领
    荣毅仁
    我看过了“人民日报”所揭发的关于胡风反革命集团的第一、第二两批材料之后，已压抑不住心中的愤慨。现在，第三批材料的公布，激起了我的更大愤怒。
    第三批材料更进一层地剥开了胡风所披的“羊皮”，把他的狰狞面目完全揭露出来了。胡风这一伙反革命黑帮，原来都是些别有来历的人物，他们老早就是蒋介石匪帮的忠实走狗，他们同帝国主义和蒋匪特务机关有着密切的联系。胡风和他的一伙是隐藏在我们人民中间的一贯反党、反人民、反革命的敌人。他们披着马克思主义的外衣，耍着两面派的手法，长期地潜伏在人民内部，到处散布细菌毒素，迷惑群众，骗取人民的信任，干着反革命的阴谋勾当。这伙反革命黑帮的手段真是毒辣、卑鄙！
    当我看了第一、第二两批材料之后，虽然已经认识到胡风是长期地、一贯地、不择手段地在反对中国共产党，反对中国人民，反对中国革命；但，我还以为胡风所以处心积虑地组织他的集团，是企图取消中国共产党在文艺战线上的领导权，妄想把文艺领导的“大旗抓到手里”，以达到他个人野心家的狂妄无耻的目的。看了第三批材料之后，认识到这样的想法是太天真了。现在，我们更清楚地晓得了胡风集团不是一个什么简单的“文艺”集团，而是一个以“文艺”为幌子、同蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的反革命政治集团；他们也不只是什么简单地企图夺取文艺战线的领导权，而是要彻底破坏我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，所以他们仇恨一切人民革命力量，他们要使共产党领导的中国人民革命政权“呜呼完蛋”。对于这些怙恶不悛的反革命分子，我们绝对不能再宽容了，我们绝对不能再麻木不仁了。我们人民一定要彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团。我们人民一定要坚决、彻底、干净、全部地将一切反革命分子肃清。
    我们工商界必须团结起来，同全国人民一道，在中国共产党英明正确的领导下，为彻底肃清胡风反革命集团而斗争。我们工商界还要从胡风反革命事件中吸取教训，加强学习，百倍地提高警惕。必须认识，当我们国家正在社会主义道路上前进的时候，反革命分子必然要更加进行破坏活动。我们工商界，在接受社会主义改造过程中，往往会注重个人的局部利益，忽视国家的整体利益，这就很容易被反革命分子钻空子，给他们以进行造谣污蔑、挑拨离间的阴谋活动的机会。还必须认识，一切反革命分子和集团，他们的手段，他们的阴谋是很毒辣、很阴险、很不容易识破的，他们会利用一切可以利用的机会混到我们人民内部来，他们也必然会混到我们工商界的队伍中来；因此，我们工商界要诚心诚意地服从工人阶级的领导，团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，积极接受社会主义改造，并且随时随刻加强学习，提高认识，明辨是非，分清敌我，学会善于辨别反革命分子的本领，为粉碎一切国内外敌人的阴谋破坏活动而斗争到底。这是我们每一个爱国的工商业者应该坚决做到的。
