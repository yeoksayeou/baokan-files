　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 20th - The workers building the Baocheng Railway laid the tracks out of Sichuan Province on June 17th. Thus, more than half of the track-laying work for the entire Baocheng Railway line has been completed.
　　On the afternoon the tracks were laid out of Sichuan Province, the workers nailing the tracks and building the bridges started the huge bridge-laying machine and placed the heavy T-beams on the boundary bridge between Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces. The track-laying workers then laid the steel rails. At this time, hundreds of farmers who had come specially from the deep mountains on the Sichuan-Shaanxi border to watch the bridge-laying and track-laying cheered. Zhou, a 68-year-old woman from Ningqiang County, Shaanxi Province, had not been down the mountain for eight years. That day, she took her daughter-in-law, niece, and granddaughter down the mountain early in the morning to watch the bridge-laying. Han Youhe, a 67-year-old farmer who had been the chairman of the village workers' and peasants' democratic government in the old revolutionary base area in this area twenty years ago, also came to watch the bridge-laying that day. When he saw the train coming, he smiled and said: The train is leaving Sichuan, and the entire Baocheng Railway line will soon be open to traffic. The lives of the people in our area will get better and better.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 20th - The construction of the Baocheng Railway has received enthusiastic support from the people on the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces. From last year to now, the people of Guangyuan County, Sichuan Province, have built more than 150,000 square meters of sheds along the railway line for the workers, allowing more than 40,000 railway construction workers to have a place to live. In addition, they also supplied more than 21,000 square meters of wood and more than 15,000 railway sleepers, ensuring the needs of construction. In the first quarter of this year, more than 1,000 farmers in Guangyuan County voluntarily participated in hammering stone ballast and transporting track ballast over short distances.
　　In May of this year, Shaanxi Province organized a large-scale comfort delegation and opera troupe to visit the construction site, and also organized medical teams to treat the workers. The people of Lueyang and seven other counties in Shaanxi Province also supplied large quantities of rice straw, wood, rice, meat, and fresh vegetables. In order to support the railway construction, the Baocheng May 1st Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shaanxi Province has planned to increase grain production by two kilograms per mu, raise sixty more fat pigs, and plant more than ten mu of vegetables this year.
　　In the areas where the tracks have been laid, farmers have voluntarily organized themselves to participate in railway protection. In February of this year, Xinmin Township, Guangyuan County, organized 183 people to patrol at night in shifts to protect railways, bridges, and station warehouses.

    宝成铁路的路轨已经铺出四川省境
    川陕边境人民热烈支援宝成铁路的修建
    新华社成都二十日电　修筑宝成铁路的职工，已在六月十七日把路轨铺出四川省境。这样，宝成铁路整个线路的铺轨工程就完成了一半以上。
    路轨铺出四川省境的这天下午，钉道架桥的工人开动着巨大的架桥机，把沉重的丁字梁安放在川陕两省的分界桥上，铺轨工人跟着就铺上了钢轨。这时，从川陕边境深山中特来观看架桥铺轨的成百个农民欢呼起来。陕西省宁强县六十八岁的周老太婆，八年没有下过山。这一天，她带着媳妇、侄女和孙女，一早下山到桥头来看架桥。二十年前曾在这一带革命老根据地做过村工农民主政府主席的六十七岁的老农民韩友和，那天也赶来看架桥。当他看见火车开来的时候，笑着说：火车出四川，宝成铁路全线通车就快了。我们这一带人民的生活也会越来越好了。
    新华社成都二十日电　修建中的宝成铁路得到四川、陕西两省边界人民热烈的支援。从去年到现在，四川省广元县人民在铁路沿线为工人先后搭盖了十五万多平方公尺的工棚，使四万多筑路工人能够安宿。另外，他们还供应了木材二万一千多平方公尺，枕木一万五千多根，保证了施工需要。今年第一季度，广元县有一千多农民自动参加捶打石碴和短距离运送道碴的工作。
    今年五月份，陕西省组织了大规模的慰问团和戏曲演出队到工地慰问，同时还组织了医疗组为工人治病。陕西省略阳等七个县的人民，还供应了大量的稻草、木料、大米、肉类和新鲜的菜蔬。陕西省褒城五一农业生产合作社为了支援铁路建设，今年订出计划要在每亩地上多增产两斤粮食，多喂六十只肥猪，多种十多亩地的菜蔬。
    在路轨铺到的地区，农民自动组织起来参加护路。广元县新民乡今年二月份就组织了一百八十三人轮流巡夜，保护铁路、桥梁和车站仓库。
