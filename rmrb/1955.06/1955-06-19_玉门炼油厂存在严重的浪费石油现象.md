To the Editor:

    Yumen Oilfield is our country's first and largest petroleum base. Here, a large amount of oil is extracted every day, supplying the needs of industrial construction throughout the country. At the same time, it is worth noting that because there is more oil produced here, some people don't care, resulting in serious waste of oil in some units, the refinery being the most prominent one.
    Walking into some of the workshops of the refinery, you can see oil everywhere; people who don't know the situation may think this is an unavoidable phenomenon, but in fact, this is all man-made waste. The packing of a centrifugal pump in the cold pressing field of the Third Workshop has been leaking oil for more than a year. The workers have repeatedly asked the leaders to repair it, but the leaders believe that "it's nothing, we can make up for it by increasing production," and they have not taken care of it. At first, the workers automatically used buckets to collect the oil. In one leaking place, they collected four large buckets of oil in six hours, averaging one kilogram every two minutes. This means a loss of 720 kilograms of oil per day. Simply connecting a few meters of pipe to the packing of the centrifugal pump to recover the leaking oil could save 21,000 kilograms of solvent oil per month. The refinery leaders have long turned a blind eye to this serious oil leakage phenomenon and have not taken any measures to prevent it. A section of waxy diesel pipe between the Second Workshop and the Third Workshop leaked, losing 13,500 kilograms of oil per month, but the two workshops shirked responsibility and no one was willing to pay for repairs. Three reflux oil pumps in the First Workshop leaked, losing 58 kilograms per day, which amounts to 1,740 kilograms per month. From June of last year until now, it has been leaking for a whole year. Initial estimates put the oil loss at over 20,000 kilograms.
    The water discharged from the raw material and finished product section every day contains some oil. Because there is no recovery equipment, the oil mixes with the water and flows to Xiba. According to preliminary estimates, at least 15,000 kilograms are lost per month from gasoline and kerosene alone. A layer of oil slick often floats on the Petroleum River near Yumen. In the first quarter of this year alone, the Yumen Oilfield Office of the Lanzhou Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Petroleum Company mobilized workers to scoop out more than 200 barrels of oil products from a small ditch leading out of the refinery.
    The refinery also has many serious shortcomings in the storage of crude oil, finished products, and semi-finished products. Because the cooling equipment is poor, the temperature of the oil is high, and the storage is not strict, the light components of the oil evaporate, and this loss is simply incalculable. In the Third Workshop alone, the loss of solvent oil, including the leaked oil, amounts to more than 60,000 kilograms per month. As early as 1953, workers suggested installing breathers on the solvent oil tanks to prevent losses, but they have not been installed to this day.
    Waste of oil products like that at the refinery also exists in other departments of the Yumen Oilfield. For example, every time the Drilling Division drills a new well, it has to test out a lot of crude oil, but no one collects this crude oil, and it is discarded by the tons. Recently, the Third Oil Testing Team collected 20,000 kilograms of crude oil near a well in ten days, which shows the seriousness of the waste phenomenon.
    Petroleum is the country's most valuable asset. We have spent a lot of labor and capital to produce more petroleum, and countless industrial construction departments across the country urgently need the Yumen Oilfield to produce more petroleum. How can we bear to watch tons and tons of oil being wasted in vain? We hope that the relevant leaders of the Yumen Oilfield will pay close attention to correcting all wasteful behaviors of petroleum.

### 玉门炼油厂存在严重的浪费石油现象

    玉门炼油厂存在严重的浪费石油现象编辑同志：
    玉门石油矿是我国第一个最大的石油基地。这里，每天开采着大量的石油，供给全国各地工业建设的需要。同时，值得注意的是由于这里出的石油多了，有的人就满不在乎，以致在一些单位里存在着严重的浪费石油的现象，炼油厂就是最突出的一个单位。
    走进炼油厂的一些车间，可以看到遍地是油；不了解情况的人也许会认为这是不可避免的现象，其实，这都是人为的浪费。第三车间冷榨场一个离心泵的盘根漏油已经一年多了。工人们多次向领导上提出要修理，但是领导上认为“算不了什么，我们多增产一点就补上了”，一直没有管它。开始，工人们自动用桶去接油，他们在一处漏油的地方，六个钟头就接了四大桶油，平均两分钟接一公斤。一天要损失七百二十公斤油。只需在离心泵的盘根处接上一根几公尺的管子把漏出的油回收起来，一个月就可以少浪费溶剂油二万一千公斤。对于这种严重的漏油现象，炼油厂领导上长期熟视无睹，不加防止。第二车间和第三车间之间的一段含腊柴油管漏了，一个月漏油一万三千五百公斤，可是两个车间互相推卸责任，谁也不愿意出钱修理。第一车间有三个回流油泵漏油，一天要漏损五十八公斤，一个月就漏损一千七百四十公斤。从去年六月份直到现在，漏了整整一年了，初步估计损失油在二万公斤以上。
    原料成品股每天放出来的水，含有一些油份，因为没有回收设备，油和水混在一起流到西河坝去了。据初步估计，只汽油和煤油两项，一个月内至少损失一万五千公斤。玉门附近的石油河上经常漂浮着一层油花。中国石油公司兰州采购供应站驻玉门油矿办事处，在今年第一季度里就发动工人在炼油厂通出的一条小水沟里捞出油品二百多桶。
    炼油厂在原油、成品和半成品的保管方面也存在着很多严重的缺点。因为冷却设备差，油的温度高，又加上保管不严，油的轻质部分都挥发了，这种损失简直无法计算。只是第三车间溶剂油的损失加上漏损的油在内，一个月内就浪费六万公斤以上。早在一九五三年工人们就建议在溶剂油罐上装呼吸器，防止损失，但一直到现在还没有安装。
    像炼油厂这样浪费油品的现象在玉门油矿其他部门也是存在的。例如，钻井处每钻出一口新井就要试出许多原油来，但是这些原油没有人收留，都成吨的扔掉了。最近，试油三队十天中在一口井的附近就收集了原油二万公斤，可见浪费现象的严重。
    石油是国家最宝贵的财富，我们为了生产更多的石油不知花费了多少劳动和资金，全国不知有多少工业建设部门迫切需要玉门油矿生产更多的石油。我们怎么能忍心看着把成吨成吨的石油白白浪费掉，希望玉门油矿有关领导方面切实注意纠正一切浪费石油的行为。
