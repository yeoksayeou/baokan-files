    The Harbin Electric Machinery Plant is trial-producing China's first 10,000 kW large hydropower equipment (including water turbine, generator, and other accessories). This hydropower equipment, which will be taller than a three-story building when installed, will be installed in the newly built Guanting Reservoir Hydropower Station. Currently, the water turbine volute and draft tube have been transported to the Guanting Reservoir Hydropower Station for installation, and the water turbine stay ring will also be shipped out of the factory soon.
    The Harbin Electric Machinery Plant started trial-producing the 10,000 kW large hydropower equipment at the beginning of this year. Prior to this, the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant had successfully trial-produced a 6,000 kW medium-sized hydropower equipment. Although the volume and structure of the 10,000 kW hydropower equipment being trial-produced now are much larger and more complex than previous products, with the guidance of Soviet experts, the plant's technical personnel and workers have overcome and continue to overcome various difficulties in the trial production. When precision machining the water turbine main shaft, the workers and technical personnel boldly tried the advanced Soviet experience of using a hard alloy wide-blade finishing tool for high-speed cutting, which ensured the quality of the finishing and increased the cutting efficiency by more than 200 times compared to the past.

    哈尔滨电机厂试制一万瓩大型水力发电设备
    哈尔滨电机厂正在试制我国第一套一万瓩大型水力发电设备（包括水轮机、发电机和其他附件）。这套安装起来要比三层楼房还要高的水力发电设备，将安装在新建的官厅水库水力发电站里。现在，水轮机涡壳和泄水管已经运到官厅水库水力发电站进行安装，水轮机座环不久也将装运出厂。
    哈尔滨电机厂试制一万瓩大型水力发电设备是从今年年初开始的。在此以前，哈尔滨电机厂曾试制成功了六千瓩的中型水力发电设备。现在试制的一万瓩水力发电设备，虽然体积和结构都比以前的产品要大和复杂得多，但是在苏联专家指导下，全厂技术人员和工人已经克服并在继续克服试制中的各种困难。在精车水轮机主轴时，工人们和技术人员大胆地试用了苏联先进经验—利用硬质合金宽刃光刀进行高速切削，结果保证了精车质量，切削效率也比过去提高二百倍以上。
