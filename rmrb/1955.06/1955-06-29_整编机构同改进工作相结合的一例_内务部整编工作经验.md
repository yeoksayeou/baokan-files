An Example of Combining Institutional Streamlining with Work Improvement
——Experiences in the Streamlining Work of the Ministry of Internal Affairs
Shi Fang

The work of streamlining institutions has just begun, and some of the more responsible personnel in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, including directors and deputy directors, were emotionally resistant to this streamlining effort. Some people believed that the Ministry of Internal Affairs already had a small establishment, with fewer than six hundred people, while its responsibilities were indeed quite diverse, ranging from preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, social relief, local government organizational construction, land administration, household registration, to marriage registration. Where could they possibly cut more? Some people believed that the situation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs was unique and could not be compared with other departments. Even if there were to be cuts, they could only be twenty or thirty percent, certainly not a "halving." Others believed that a large-scale reduction of institutions and personnel was only possible if the workload was also drastically reduced. In order to break through these conservative ideas, the ministry leadership, in addition to convening meetings of staff members above the level of director and deputy director to repeatedly study methods of adjusting and merging institutions, and focusing on investigating and researching ways to streamline administrative staff in the offices, also specifically organized forces to go deep into each unit, hold座谈会 with staff and clerks, understand the specific situation, specifically calculate the workload, and discover problems from every work link, tapping potential, and then using the specific facts of bloated institutions and overstaffing to get through the thinking of the responsible personnel in each unit. At the same time, the leading staff members of the ministry also went deep into each unit, personally participated in their meetings to study streamlining work, and carefully examined and approved the streamlining drafts proposed by each unit. Through these measures, the thinking of many people was quickly reversed. The preliminary streamlining draft basically achieved the target of reducing staffing by fifty percent.

In this streamlining work, the Ministry of Internal Affairs implemented the spirit of combining streamlining with inspection and improvement of work, and made serious inspections of the existing problems in institutions, staffing, and work, and proposed improvement measures, thus smoothly achieving the goal of streamlining institutions and improving work efficiency.

The inspection revealed that, although the institutional setup of the Ministry of Internal Affairs basically conformed to the policy of focusing on preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief, there were also situations where institutions did not match the work. For example, the land administration and housing work managed by the Land Administration Department, the marriage registration and migrant worker mobilization work managed by the Second and Third Sections of the Social Affairs Department, and the ethnic region government organizational construction work handled by the Third Section of the Civil Affairs Department, some of which are currently local work, and the central government cannot uniformly manage them; some are work coordinated with other departments, the main business is in other departments, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs does not need to do much regular work, so there is no need to set up special departments and sections to manage them. Furthermore, the training of civil affairs cadres, although important in nature, does not involve a large workload; administrative division work and local government organizational construction work are similar in nature and have frequent contact in work, but they are divided into the Household Registration and Civil Affairs departments. All of these have increased the number of institutions, increased staffing, dispersed leadership, and unevenly distributed the workload of staff. Conversely, urban relief work is one of the key businesses of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, with heavy tasks, but only one section of the Social Affairs Department is managing it. Planning and financial work is directly related to the main businesses such as preferential treatment, disaster relief, and social relief, but currently only a financial section is set up under the General Office to be responsible for management. These all show that there are indeed many unreasonable aspects in the current institutional setup of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

The inspection also revealed that some of the work systems of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are unreasonable, and the working methods are unscientific, especially the problems in document work are the most. According to the current regulations, for receiving and sending a document, in addition to the ministry having external receiving and sending and internal receiving and sending, most departments have receiving and sending of open documents and receiving and sending of confidential documents, and some sections also have兼职receiving and sending. A document entering and leaving the Ministry of Internal Affairs often has to go through four receiving and sending procedures: internal, external, department, and section. The filing and archiving of documents are carried out by the Document Section and the Confidential Section according to open documents, confidential documents, official documents, and telegrams respectively; this method often divides the materials of a case into several places, making it very inconvenient to retrieve files and check archives. The drafting and signing procedures for official documents are also relatively cumbersome. The documents drafted by general staff members must go through seven or eight review and signing procedures by the section chief, department secretary or office director, department (bureau) director, full-time draft reviewer of the General Office, director of the General Office, deputy minister in charge, executive vice minister, and minister before they can be sent out. This red tape working method will naturally affect the improvement of work efficiency and the improvement of work quality, and increase the staffing of receiving and sending, document, confidential, and secretarial personnel. Unscientific working methods are also clearly reflected in some downward-sent documents. Some units in the ministry are accustomed to replying individually and sporadically to requests and inquiries from lower-level agencies and the people concerning policies, laws, regulations, and measures, so that the same question is answered in one place, and another place comes to ask, often unable to respond in time. This handicraft-style working method increases the number of unnecessary downward-sent documents, and the staffing of staff members, clerks, printing, receiving and sending personnel is also correspondingly increased. In addition, in the handling of business data and investigation work reports, some units are not good at comprehensive analysis, and do not distinguish between important and unimportant and whether there is reference and utilization value, and uniformly print and distribute them sporadically, which also increases the workload of printing and other aspects.

The inspection also found that there are also unreasonable aspects in the allocation and use of cadres. In the past, many units often shouted that the workload was heavy and they could not cope with it, and demanded an increase in staffing. However, although the staffing continued to increase, the problem was still not solved. Where exactly is the problem? In addition to the unreasonable institutional setup, which affects the centralized use of cadres, and the lack of a strong sense of responsibility among a few staff members, and insufficient activity and initiative in work, there is also an important reason: the majority of the work of a department or section is often added to a few responsible comrades who are considered to have strong work ability and are "easy to use," ignoring the training and improvement of general staff, and not paying attention to giving play to the enthusiasm of general staff. In addition, some units have too many secretaries and too many deputy positions, which is also unreasonable. Some secretaries cannot get involved in the business, so they have to manage the welfare issues of the staff. Some units have secretaries specifically in charge of the ideological education and theoretical study of the staff. As a result, the responsible personnel of the departments and sections relax their leadership in this area, and administrative leadership is separated from ideological leadership.

In response to the above problems, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in addition to making appropriate adjustments to the institutional staffing based on work needs, first of all, to make it conform to the principle of streamlining and concentration. The result of the adjustment is as follows: except for the Preferential Treatment Bureau in charge of preferential treatment and demobilization, the Social Affairs Department and the Land Administration Department were abolished, and the urban relief work originally managed by the Social Affairs Department was specially set up as the Urban Relief Department to manage; the original Relief Department was renamed the Rural Relief Department, still managing disaster relief and rural social relief; the Civil Affairs Department and the Household Registration Department were merged and still called the Civil Affairs Department, managing household registration and nationality work, undertaking local government organizational construction work and administrative division work, and taking over part of the business of the original Land Administration Department and Social Affairs Department and the training of civil affairs cadres originally under the leadership of the General Office. Under the General Office, the Cadre Division and the Finance Section were abolished, the Confidential Section was merged into the Document Section, and a Planning and Finance Department directly under the leadership of the ministry was established to be in charge of financial planning, allocation, and statistics. The section units under each department and bureau were also appropriately reduced and adjusted. In this way, the original five departments, one bureau, one office, and twenty-eight sections were streamlined into three departments, one bureau, one office, one directly affiliated department, and twenty sections. And the setup of the division-level under the office and bureau was cancelled. At the same time, appropriate adjustments were also made to the allocation of staff, which can reduce about five department and bureau-level staff, and thirty-five section-level staff (including secretaries), accounting for 28% and 36% of the original establishment, respectively.

While making the above adjustments, the Ministry of Internal Affairs focused on improving the work system and working methods, and greatly reduced the number of secretaries, printing, receiving and sending, and odd-job personnel. First, the document processing procedures were simplified, the internal and external receiving and sending were unified, the document and confidential work were merged, and it was stipulated that open and confidential official documents should be operated uniformly, and the method of unit filing was implemented. Second, the procedures for drafting and signing manuscripts were simplified. For more important manuscripts to be drafted, the leading personnel of the division and section should first clarify the intentions, or organize collective research to determine the basic content, and then assign someone to write it. Important manuscripts are encouraged to be written by the person in charge of the unit. The offices of each department and bureau no longer have secretaries to draft and review manuscripts, only two to three clerks are left to be responsible for unit filing, meeting minutes, copying, etc. Third, downward-sent documents were streamlined, and efforts were concentrated on handling the main work. For requests and reports from various places, if the questions are the same or similar, they should be studied and comprehensively approved and answered as uniformly as possible. If a problem is raised in one area, it is estimated that other areas may also raise it, and when answering this area, it should be copied to other areas. Fourth, the work of handling letters and visits from the people should be improved. For questions raised by the masses concerning policies and laws, comprehensive research should be conducted, and standard answers should be drafted by category, or public answers should be made in newspapers. For major problems reflected in letters and visits, or if it is found that there are particularly many letters and visits in that area, people should be sent with letters and people to the countryside to jointly study and directly handle them with local agencies to overcome the phenomenon of the masses repeatedly writing and visiting because the problem is not thoroughly resolved. In addition, each unit has also launched some preliminary research on how to rectify and improve data work. After implementing the above methods, the secretaries of each department and bureau can all be abolished, and it is estimated that the printing and receiving and sending personnel can be reduced by about half, and at the same time, work efficiency can be greatly improved.

Finally, the general affairs work of the organs was also rectified. It is estimated that the number of administrative staff can be reduced from 39 to 18, and the number of odd-job personnel can be reduced from 108 to 44. In this regard, the approach of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is that, in addition to deciding to change the welfare work of the relevant staff, such as food, haircuts, laundry, etc., to enterprise management, it also paid attention to improving working methods. For example, in order to avoid affecting daily work after reducing service personnel, a method called "three unifications" was discussed and formulated by the masses. This method is adopted on the premise of advocating that staff members strengthen their labor viewpoint and do everything by themselves: (1) The general official documents within the organization are returned by the Ministry setting up a unified official document exchange station, stipulating a unified time, and each unit sends staff to hand over the official documents to be sent to the station and receive the official documents to be received, and no longer distributed to each unit by the waiters; (2) The cleaning of offices and outdoor areas is uniformly cleaned by the waiters set up by the Ministry, and the cleaning of the inside of the dormitories is the responsibility of the staff or family members themselves; (3) Drinking water during office hours is uniformly supplied by the waiters set up by the Ministry on time, and the waiters are used for other purposes at other times. After adopting these methods, there are no longer separate waiters in the offices and collective dormitories for staff, and only twelve waiters (excluding the waiters for ministers and vice ministers) are basically enough, which is 20 people less than the original establishment.

    整编机构同改进工作相结合的一例
    ——内务部整编工作经验
    石方
    整编机构的工作刚刚开始，内务部的一些比较负责的工作人员，包括司、局长在内，对这次整编工作在情绪上是有抵触的。有的人认为，内务部的编制已经够小，人数还不到六百，而内务部的业务确实很杂，从优抚、复员、救灾、社会救济、地方政权组织建设、地政、户政直到婚姻登记都得管，哪里还能再减。有的人认为，内务部的情况特殊，不能同其他部门相提并论，即使要减，也只能减个百分之二十、三十，绝不能“拦腰砍一半”。还有的人认为，要大量精简机构和人员也可以，同时也得大量缩减业务。为了打破上述种种保守思想，部的领导上除召集司、局长以上工作人员反复研究调整和裁并机构、重点调查和研究精简机关行政事务人员的办法而外，还专门组织了力量，深入各个单位，召集科员办事员座谈，了解具体情况，具体计算工作量，从每一个工作环节上发现问题，挖掘潜力，然后用机构臃肿、人浮于事的具体事实打通各单位负责人员的思想。同时，部的领导工作人员还深入各单位，亲自参加他们研究整编工作的会议，并且详细地审定各单位提出的整编草案。通过这些措施，许多人的思想很快地得到扭转。初步拟出的整编草案，基本上达到了缩减编制百分之五十的指标。
    在这次的整编工作中，内务部贯彻了整编必须同检查、改进工作相结合的精神、对机构、编制和工作上存在的问题作了认真的检查，提出了改进办法，因而顺利地达到了精简机构和提高工作效率的目的。
    在检查中发现，虽然内务部的机构设置，基本上符合以优抚、复员、救灾、社会救济为业务重点的方针，但也有机构同业务不相适应的情况。例如地政司所管的地政、房产工作，社会司二科和三科所管的婚姻登记和民工动员工作，民政司三科办理的民族地区政权组织建设工作等，有些在目前还属地方性的工作，中央不可能统一管理；有些是配合其他部门做的工作，主要业务在其他部门，内务部要做的经常工作不多，不必设专门的司和科来管理。再如民政干部的训练工作，性质虽属重要，但工作不多；行政区划工作和地方政权组织建设工作，业务性质相近，工作中的经常联系也多，却分在户政和民政两个司里。所有这些，都使得机构增多，编制加大，并且使领导力量分散，工作人员忙闲不均。相反的，城市救济工作是内务部的重点业务之一，任务繁重，但是只有社会司的一个科在管理。计划财务工作，是直接关系到优抚、救灾和社会救济等主要业务的工作，目前却只在办公厅下设一个财务科来负责管理。这些都说明目前在内务部机构的设置上，的确有很多不合理的地方。
    在检查中还发现内务部的有些工作制度不合理，工作方法不科学，特别是文书工作方面的问题最多。按目前的规定，收发一件公文，除部有外收发和内收发以外，多数司里有明件收发和密件收发，有些科里还有兼职收发。一件公文进出内务部常常要经过内、外、司、科四道收发手续。文件的立卷、归档，由文书科和机要科按明件、密件、公文、电报分别进行；这种分法常常使一案的材料分在数处，调卷、查档都很不方便。公文的拟办核签程序也比较繁多，一般科员拟的文件，要经过科长、司秘书或局办公室主任、司（局）长、办公厅专职核稿人、办公厅主任、主管副部长、常务副部长、部长等七、八道审核签字程序，才能出门。这种文牍主义的工作方法，当然会影响工作效率的提高和工作质量的改进，并且增多了收发、文书、机要、秘书等人员的编制。工作方法不科学，也明显地表现在某些对下行文方面。部里有些单位对下级机关和人民群众提出的有关政策、法令、条例、办法的请示和询问，习惯于个别地零星地答复，以致同一个问题答复一处、别处又来问，常常应答不暇。这种手工业式的工作方法，使得不必要的对下行文增多，科员、办事员和文印、收发等人员的编制也相应加大。此外，在业务资料和调查工作报告的处理方面，有些单位不善于综合分析，不分重要次要和有无参考利用价值，一律零星打印分送，也使文印等方面工作量增大。
    在检查中还发现，在干部的调配和使用上，也有不合理的地方。过去许多单位经常叫喊工作任务重，忙不过来，要求增加编制。但是尽管编制不断增大，而问题还是没有解决。问题究竟在什么地方呢？除了机构设置不合理，影响干部的集中使用，少数工作人员的责任心不强，工作不够积极、主动以外，还有一个重要原因是：一个司或一个科的多数工作往往加在几个负责同志认为工作能力强和使用“顺手”的工作人员身上，忽略了对一般工作人员的培养和提高，不注意发挥一般工作人员的积极性。此外，有些单位秘书多，副职人员多，也是不合理的。有的秘书在业务上插不上手，只好多管些工作人员的生活福利问题。有些单位设有秘书专管工作人员的思想教育和理论学习。结果，司、科负责人员放松了对这方面工作的领导，行政领导同思想领导脱节。
    针对上述的问题，内务部除根据工作需要，首先对机构编制作了适当的调整，使之符合于精干集中的原则。调整的结果是这样的：除主管优抚、复员业务的优抚局不动以外，撤销了社会司和地政司，原属社会司管理的城市救济工作，专设城市救济司管理；原救济司改名为农村救济司，仍管理救灾和农村社会救济；民政司同户政司合并，仍称民政司，管理户口、国籍工作，承办地方政权组织建设工作和行政区划工作，并接管原地政司、社会司的部分业务和原属办公厅领导的民政干部的训练工作。办公厅下面撤销了干部处、财务科，将机要科并入文书科，另外成立了直属部领导的计划财务处，主管财务计划调拨和统计等工作。各司、局下的科室单位也作了适当的裁并和调整。这样就从原有的五司、一局、一厅、二十八个科室精简为三司、一局、一厅、一直属处、二十个科室。并且取消了厅、局下的处一级的设置。同时，对工作人员的配备也作了适当的调整，约可减少司、局长级工作人员五人、科级工作人员（包括秘书）三十五人，各占原编制数的百分之二十八和百分之三十六。
    在作上述调整的同时，内务部着重注意了工作制度和工作方法的改进，大量减少了秘书、文印、收发和勤杂人员。第一、简化了文书处理手续，统
  一了内、外收发，合并了文书、机要工作，规定明、密公文统一运转，并且实行了单位立卷的办法。第二、简化了拟办核签文稿的手续。凡是拟办较重要的文稿，司科的领导人员应事先交清意图，或组织集体研究，确定基本内容，再指定人执笔。重要文稿提倡由单位负责人员亲自动手。各司、局办公室不再设秘书拟稿核稿，只留科办事员二至三人，负责单位立卷、会议记录、抄写等工作。第三、精简对下行文，集中力量办理主要工作。各地的请示报告，凡问题相同或类似的，尽可能统一研究，综合批示和答复。一个地区提出的问题，估计其他地区也可能提出，在答复这个地区的时候，应抄致其他地区。第四、改进处理人民来信、来访工作。对群众提出的有关政策、法令的问题，应综合研究，分类拟定标准答案，或者在报纸上作公开答复。对来信、来访中反映的重大问题，或者发现那个地区的来信、来访特别多，应派人带信、带人下乡，协同地方机关集中研究，直接处理，以克服因问题解决不透，群众返复来信、来访的现象。此外，对如何整顿、改进资料工作，也发动各单位作了一些初步的研究。实行上述办法以后，各司、局的秘书可以一律撤销，文印、收发人员，估计可以减少二分之一左右，同时还可以大大提高工作效率。
    最后，还整顿了机关总务工作。估计事务人员可以由三十九人减为十八人，勤杂人员由一百零八人减为四十四人。在这方面内务部的作法是，除决定将有关工作人员的福利工作，如伙食、理发、洗衣等，改为企业化的经营管理以外，也注意了工作方法的改进。例如，为了在减少服务人员以后不致影响日常工作，便由群众讨论、订出了一个叫做“三统”的办法。这个办法是在提倡工作人员加强劳动观点，遇事大家动手的前提下，采用：（一）机关内部一般公文的往返，由部设公文统一交换站，规定统一时间，由各单位派工作人员将应送出的公文交站，将应收的公文领回，不再由服务员往各单位分送；（二）办公室和室外的清洁卫生，由部设服务员统一打扫，宿舍内部的清洁卫生，由工作人员或家属自己负责；（三）办公时间饮水，由部设服务员按时统一供应，其余时间服务员另作他用。采用这些办法以后，办公室和工作人员集体宿舍就不再分设服务员，全部只要有十二个服务员（部长、副部长的服务员不在内）就基本上够用了，比原来的编制减少了二十个人。
