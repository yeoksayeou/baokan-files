    Sitar—The Singing Zither
    ——Listening to a Sitar Solo by the Indian Cultural Delegation
    Ye Lin
    I have seen and heard many kinds of zithers. Each zither can be said to be a symbol of national culture. They contain the crystallization of the wisdom accumulated by various peoples over many years. The sound of each nation's zither can help us understand the characteristics of that nation's culture.

    The sitar is such a zither. In India, known as the cradle of world civilization, this moving instrument enjoys great prestige in classical music and was once transmitted in its earliest form to various countries, giving a good influence to the music of Greece, Arabia, and other countries. Around the eleventh century, this instrument was brought back to India from Persia and began to be called the sitar. After continuous development and improvement, it took its current form in the fourteenth century. Because it has a deep tradition and possesses all the characteristics of Indian national musical instruments, it has become the most beloved classical plucked instrument of this respectable nation. More than 100 classical pieces dedicated to this instrument have been compiled and recorded, and 1,200 more are waiting to be recorded. The sitar player is himself the composer of the sitar music, and new creations are constantly being produced and circulated. Indian friends tell us that playing the sitar is a science in itself.

    One of the characteristics of Indian stringed instruments is that, in addition to the main strings of the instrument, there are many resonant strings installed on the body of the zither. When the main strings sound, these resonant strings also vibrate with the sound waves, forming a cluster of harmonious tones that resonate around the melody of the main strings. In many other stringed instruments, we can find this kind of resonant string device. For example, the sarangi, another classical bowed instrument often used for vocal accompaniment, has as many as thirty such resonant strings. However, because the sitar has a longer body, an especially wide soundbox that runs directly to the fingerboard, and five of the seven main strings are made of steel and two are made of copper, the resonant tones during performance have a metallic sound, gorgeous and grand. Listening with eyes closed, it is like a swarm of bees in a flower cluster, adding infinitely rich artistic imagery.

    We were very pleased to be able to hear Mr. Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan's touching performance in the Indian Cultural Delegation's performance. When this reddish-brown instrument with a brilliant luster appeared on the stage, it attracted us with its unique style, rich in national characteristics. When it emitted its first moving tone under Mr. Khan's fingers, rich artistic images further unfolded before our eyes.

    The piece played by Mr. Khan, although we do not yet know if it has a titled meaning, the entire performance makes people feel that it is full of singing quality, with beautiful melodies, profound linguistic elements, and lyrical qualities. It seems to be telling us a moving story in the gentle light of the Eastern moonlit night and under the dense shade of coconut trees, using simple and plain language, with a soft tone full of emotion. In this, the vibration of the resonant strings deepens the depth of the melodic image, makes the melody's imagery have greater appeal, and makes people feel that its meaning is very deep, with philosophical implications. If this piece expresses love, it must be a heart-stirring love; if it is peace, it must be the happiest peace. When the music speeds up in the later part, the sitar under Mr. Khan's fingers sprinkled a burst of excited musical rain, accompanied by the dense and rapid drumbeats of the accompaniment, unfolding the dramatic climax of the story's development. The audience's emotions also became excited with the sound of the zither, and they were all deeply moved by the moving theme of the story, concerned about the fate of its protagonist. My imagination soared with the music. In the excitement of the zither's sound, the graceful dance of the beautiful Indrani Rahman appeared before my eyes once again. This love song from the Bharata Natyam dance was singing again:

      “……
    Like bees relying on lotus flowers, believe me, with fire as witness!
    Like fish relying on the ocean, believe me, with heaven and earth as a pledge!
    Together, we will be happy; if in the pain of separation,
    I will be drowned in the ocean of love.
      ……”

    Until the zither's sound disappeared into space, the ocean of my thoughts was still surging!

    What beautiful Eastern music! It pulsates with the kind hearts of the great Indian people. It is our happiness to be able to hear such a profound performance. Because this music has the style of Eastern nations and lyrical elements of singing quality, coupled with the high artistic attainments of Indian art masters, I believe that the Chinese people can understand and love Indian national music.

    Thank you very much to the artists of the Indian Cultural Delegation. Because of their outstanding work, we can further understand the outstanding achievements and practical significance of the Indian people in promoting national traditional culture and art. The contributions of the great Indian poet, painter, playwright, novelist, and musician Tagore in studying the traditions of Indian classical music, and his merits in turning classical music to the people, and combining the excellent parts of folk music and classical music, are worthy of our deep praise. Indian culture and art have given us a profound influence, and this influence will continue to strengthen in the future.

    锡达尔——歌唱的琴
    ——听印度文化代表团锡达尔独奏
    叶林
    我曾经看到和听到过不少的琴。每一种琴都可以说是一种民族文化的象征。这里面蕴藏着各族人民在多少年来所积累起来的智慧的结晶。每一个民族的琴音，都可以帮助我们了解这个民族的文化的特色。
    锡达尔，就是这样的琴。在有世界文明的摇篮之称的印度，这件动人的乐器在古典音乐中享有极大的声誉，并曾经以它底最早的样式流传到各国，给希腊、阿拉伯等国家的音乐以良好的影响。约在十一世纪时，这件乐器又从波斯带返印度，开始称为锡达尔，经过了不断的发展和改良，到了十四世纪，才形成为目前的样式。由于它有深厚的传统和具有印度民族乐器的一切特征，故成为这个令人尊敬的民族所最为喜爱的古典拨弹乐器。专供这乐器演奏的古典乐曲已被整理纪录下来的就有一百多首，还有一千二百首有待纪录。锡达尔的演奏者本身就是锡达尔的作曲家，新的创作还在不断产生和流传。印度的朋友告诉我们：演奏锡达尔本身就是一种科学。
    印度弦乐器的特征之一，是除了乐器的主弦以外，在琴身上还装有许多共鸣弦，当主弦发声的时候，这些共鸣弦也随着音波的震动而发响，形成了一簇谐和的音群，围绕着主弦的旋律而响动。在好些其它的弦乐器中，我们都可以发现有这种共鸣弦的装置。如另一种经常作为声乐伴奏用的古典擦弦乐器萨朗基，就装有这样的共鸣弦达三十根之多。可是，由于锡达尔的琴身较长，共鸣箱特别宽大，直通指板，七根主弦中有五根是钢制的，二根是铜的，因而演奏时的共鸣音群便带有金属之声，华丽而宽宏，闭目听来，有如万花丛里的蜂群，增加了无限丰富的艺术意象。
    我们非常高兴地在印度文化代表团的演出中，能够听到了阿卜杜勒·哈利姆·贾法尔·康恩先生的打动人心的演奏。当这个红褐色的闪耀着华丽的光泽的乐器出现在舞台上的时候，它便以一种富有民族特性的特有的样式吸引着我们。当它在康恩先生的指下发出了第一声动人的音调时，丰富的艺术形象便进一步在眼前展开了。
    康恩先生所演奏的曲子，虽然我们还不知道是否有标题的涵义，但整个演奏可以使人感到是充满着歌唱性的，有着美好的旋律，深刻的语言因素和抒情的性质。它好像是用纯朴而平易的语言，带着充满感情的柔和的声调，在东方溶溶的月夜和椰子树的浓荫下，向我们叙说着一段动人的故事。这当中，由于共鸣弦的震动，加深了旋律形象的深度，使旋律的意象具有更大的感染力，使人感到它的涵义很深，带有哲学性的意味。如果说这段乐曲表达的是爱，这一定是一种动人肺腑的爱；如果说这是和平，就一定是一种最幸福的和平。当乐曲在后段加快了速度的时候，锡达尔在康恩先生的指下洒出了一阵阵激动的音雨，伴随着伴奏的稠密急促的鼓声，展开了故事发展的戏剧性的高潮。观众的情绪也跟着琴音激动起来了，都深切地为这故事的动人的主题而颤栗着，关心着它底主人公的命运。我的想像随着乐曲飞翔，在琴音的激荡中，眼前不禁又一次地涌现了美丽的印德拉尼·拉赫曼的翩翩的舞姿，这段巴拉达那蒂亚舞中的恋歌又在歌唱了：
      “……
    好像蜜蜂依靠着荷花，相信我，以火作证！
    好像鱼依靠着海洋，相信我，凭天地为盟！
    在一起，我们会快乐，如果在别离的痛苦之中，
    我将被溺死在爱的海洋中。
      ……”
    直到琴音在空间消失，我的思想的海洋还在澎湃不已！
    多么美好的东方音乐啊，这里面跳动着伟大的印度人民的善良的心。能够听到这样深刻的演奏，是我们的幸福。由于这些音乐具有东方民族的风格和歌唱性的抒情因素，加上印度艺术大师们高度的艺术素养，我相信，中国人民对于印度民族的音乐是能够理解和喜爱的。
    非常感谢印度文化代表团的艺术家们，由于他们卓越的工作，使我们得以进一步了解印度人民在发扬民族传统文化艺术方面的杰出成就和现实的意义。印度伟大的诗人、画家、戏剧家、小说家和音乐家泰戈尔先生在研究印度古典音乐传统方面的贡献，和他把古典音乐转向人民，将民间音乐和古典音乐的优秀部分合为一体的功绩，是值得我们深切颂扬的。印度的文化艺术曾经给我们以深刻的影响，今后这种影响仍将不断加强。
