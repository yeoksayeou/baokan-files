Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Shanghai has made monthly progress in conserving industrial grain usage since the second quarter. In May, over 125,000 jin of miscellaneous grains were saved compared to April. According to the grain requirements of various factories, another 53,000 jin were saved in June compared to May. According to statistics from over 50 factories, the industrial use of flour in May was also over 130,000 jin less than in April.

    In the food and brewing industries, where grain is the primary raw material, employees have reduced grain waste during production through improved operations and management. State-owned Yimin Food Factory No. 4 has established indicators to reduce losses in flour in easily wasteful processes such as "flour spreading" and "oven loading and unloading," and these indicators have been incorporated into labor competitions, resulting in an average daily saving of approximately 200 jin of flour. Many cotton textile and printing and dyeing factories have already adopted chemical raw materials such as "sodium silicate" to replace flour-based sizing. Sixteen cigarette factories have also started using "water glass" instead of paste to package cigarettes, saving a significant amount of grain.

    上海市积极节约工业用粮
    上海市节约工业用粮工作，第二季度以来逐月有进展。五月份工业用杂粮比四月份节省十二万五千多斤，六月份根据各厂需用杂粮计划，比五月份又节省五万三千多斤。据五十多个厂的统计，工业用面粉五月份也比四月份节省十三万多斤。
    在以粮食为主要原料的食品、酿造等行业中，职工们从改进操作和管理方面，减少了生产过程中粮食的浪费。国营益民食品四厂在容易损失面粉的“撒粉”“进出炉”等工段订出了降低损耗的指标，并把这些指标列为劳动竞赛的内容，平均每天约能节省面粉二百多斤。许多棉纺织和印染工厂都已经采用“矽酸钠”等化学原料代替面粉制成的浆料。十六个卷烟厂也已经用“泡化碱”代替浆糊包装香烟，节约大量粮食。　　  （据新华社讯）
