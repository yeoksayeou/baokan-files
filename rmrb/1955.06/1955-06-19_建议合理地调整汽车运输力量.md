Suggestion to Rationally Adjust Automotive Transportation Capacity
Editor:

With the continuous development of highway transportation and urban transportation, I have noticed an unreasonable phenomenon in the distribution of automotive transportation capacity. For example, in Gansu, Baoji (Shaanxi), and other places, goods are often stockpiled due to insufficient transportation capacity, while in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, automotive transportation capacity is often surplus year-round. Furthermore, the number of freight trucks owned by various government agencies, enterprises, and institutions nationwide is 67.8 percent higher than that of state-owned transportation enterprises, while their transportation efficiency is generally very low. Taking Gansu Province as an example, in 1954, the provincial transportation company's trucks produced 3,000 ton-kilometers per ton per month. However, the highest monthly output of trucks owned by government agencies was 1,200 ton-kilometers, which is 60 percent lower than the provincial transportation company. In 1954, the number of freight trucks owned by agencies in Dalian increased by 51 percent compared to 1950. Some agencies' trucks are idle and engage in transportation business. For example, the external business volume of Dalian Canned Food Factory's trucks accounts for 70 percent of its total transportation volume, and that of the steel factory accounts for 57 percent. In 1954, the Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased 30 new trucks and solicited its own sources of goods, which affected the "planned transportation" of state-owned transportation enterprises and disrupted the transportation order.

With the development of national construction, the burden on the transportation sector is also increasing. To meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and urban construction, I propose the following two suggestions:

I. Strict controls should be imposed on the purchase of vehicles by government agencies, enterprises, industrial and mining enterprises, and cooperatives. Balance transportation capacity and volume, rationally allocate transportation tasks, and overcome waste phenomena such as shutdowns and empty runs.

II. Provinces and cities with surplus automotive transportation capacity should support provinces and cities with relatively lacking transportation capacity in a planned manner, mobilize higher quality vehicles for external transfer, and gradually eliminate the unreasonable distribution of automotive transportation capacity.

    建议合理地调整汽车运输力量编辑同志：
    在公路运输和城市运输不断发展中，我发现汽车运输力的分布有着不合理的现象。如：甘肃、宝鸡（陕西）等地因运输力不足，物资常有积压现象，而辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、上海、天津等地的汽车运输力却常年有余；又如：全国各机关、企业单位自用运货汽车，比国营运输企业汽车数字要多百分之六十七点八，而运输效率一般都很低。以甘肃省为例，一九五四年省运输公司汽车车吨月产三千吨公里。而机关的汽车月产最高为一千二百吨公里，比省运输公司低百分之六十。一九五四年旅大市机关自用运货汽车比一九五○年增加了百分之五十一，有些机关的车闲着没事，就从事运输营业。如旅大市罐头食品总厂汽车对外营业量占它的总运量的百分之七十，钢铁工厂占总运量的百分之五十七。一九五四年山东省供销合作总社增购了新汽车三十辆，自行招揽货源，以致影响了国营运输企业的“计划运输”，打乱了运输秩序。
    随着国家建设事业的发展，交通运输部门的负担也日益繁重，为了满足工农业生产和城市建设的需要，我提出以下两个建议：
    一、对于机关、企业、工矿、合作社等单位的汽车购置，要加以严格控制。平衡运力运量，合理地分配运输任务，克服停驶、跑空等浪费现象。
    二、汽车运输力过剩的省、市应该有计划地支援运输力较缺的省、市，动员质量较好的汽车外调，逐步消除汽车运力分布不合理的现象。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　庞立明
