Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 13th: In recent days, Vietnam's Democratic parties, people's organizations, prominent social figures, and representatives of Southern Vietnamese religious sects in North Vietnam have continued to issue statements or give talks, warmly welcoming the statement by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on holding a consultative conference. They unanimously believe that unifying the country through a general election is in line with the wishes of all Vietnamese people.

The Central Committee of the Vietnam Democratic Party passed a resolution supporting the government's statement and demanded that all party members struggle for consultation, general elections, and unification.

The Vietnam National Farmers Liaison Committee stated in its declaration that Vietnamese farmers are determined to realize the unification of Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords.

Youth and student groups such as the Vietnam Youth League, the Vietnam Labor Youth League, and the Vietnam Student Union pointed out in their joint statement that only after national unification can the complete independence and democracy of Vietnam be guaranteed.

Cao Chao Fa, the leader of the Twelve Factions Alliance of Cao Dai Religion, issued a statement on the 9th calling on Cao Dai followers in both urban and rural areas of South Vietnam to strive for the realization of a consultative conference and a nationwide general election. Huang Wen Zhi, the Hoa Hao sect leader now in Hanoi, wrote a letter to Hoa Hao followers in South Vietnam, urging them to recognize the vicious conspiracy of US imperialism and its running dogs and to work hard to demand that the South Vietnamese authorities hold a consultative conference with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Lawyer Nguyen Thanh Vinh, Standing Committee member of the Vietnam Liaison Committee of Patriotic and Peace-Loving Catholics and representative of the South Vietnam region, pointed out in a speech that South Vietnamese Catholics warmly support the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has already met the people's wishes and hopes that the responsible authorities in South Vietnam can also respect the people's wishes.

In Hanoi's newspapers, there are also many articles written by Vietnamese model workers, model peasants, combat heroes, and representatives of ethnic minorities supporting the holding of a consultative conference.
