Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 16th: The Indonesian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 15th, refuting the Dutch Foreign Minister Luns' recent White Paper issued in New York slandering Indonesian police for mistreating Dutch criminals.

The statement pointed out that this White Paper is untrue. The statement said that the Netherlands is trying to find fault with the Indonesian police's investigation of subversive activities by Dutch people in order to cover up the increasing evidence.

The statement said that the Netherlands "is trying to minimize the significance of the prosecution of subversive and illegal activities against the Republic of Indonesia, activities that are supported by overwhelming evidence, as demonstrated in the trials of the South Moluccan Republic case in Makassar and recently in Yogyakarta, which exposed the role of the Netherlands in these subversive activities. The danger of Dutch subversive activities has become even more apparent because Westerling -- the mass murderer of South Sulawesi province --'s desire to return to Indonesia is supported spiritually and materially by some Dutch people, and the Dutch government, knowing the situation, has not prevented it." The statement said that it is also clear that the Dutch government has not stopped the leaders of the "South Moluccan Republic" from continuing their activities freely from the Netherlands, and directing the rebellion in eastern Indonesia from that country with the assistance of certain Dutch groups.

Referring to the Netherlands' intention to hire American lawyers to defend Dutch criminals engaged in subversive activities, the statement said, "The Netherlands' efforts to seek non-Dutch defenders who do not understand Indonesian language and Indonesian criminal law are completely unfounded, and this clearly demonstrates its desire to involve other countries in the political dispute between the Republic of Indonesia and the Netherlands."

The statement said that the Indonesian government will publish a White Paper including all the evidence of Dutch subversive and illegal activities against Indonesia, in order to let the world know the truth.

### 印度尼西亚外交部发表声明  驳斥荷兰外交大臣对印度尼西亚的诬蔑

    印度尼西亚外交部发表声明
    驳斥荷兰外交大臣对印度尼西亚的诬蔑
    新华社雅加达十六日电　印度尼西亚外交部十五日发表声明，驳斥荷兰外交大臣伦斯最近在纽约发表的诬蔑印度尼西亚警察虐待荷兰罪犯的白皮书。
    声明指出，这份白皮书是不真实的。声明说，荷兰力图在印度尼西亚警察对荷兰人所进行的颠覆活动事件的调查工作中寻找差错，这是为了要掩盖越来越多的证据。
    声明说，荷兰“正在设法缩小对反对印度尼西亚共和国的颠覆和非法活动的起诉的意义，这些活动是罪证如山的，正像在望加锡和最近在日惹对南摩鹿加共和国案件的审判所证明的，这些审判暴露了荷兰在这些颠覆活动中的作用。由于韦斯特灵——南苏拉威西省的大规模屠杀者——想要回到印度尼西亚的行动受到一部分荷兰人精神上和物质上的支持，并且了解情况的荷兰政府并未予以阻止，荷兰的颠覆活动的危险就变得更为明显了。”声明说，还很明显的是，荷兰政府并未制止“南摩鹿加共和国”的领袖们，他们仍然自由地从荷兰继续进行他们的活动，并且在某些荷兰团体的协助下从那个国家来指挥东印度尼西亚的叛乱活动。
    声明在谈到荷兰打算雇用美国律师来为进行颠覆活动的荷兰罪犯辩护时说，“荷兰寻求不懂印度尼西亚语言和印度尼西亚刑法的非荷兰籍辩护人的努力是完全没有根据的，这清楚地表明了它想要把其他国家牵涉到印度尼西亚共和国和荷兰之间的政治争端中去。”
    声明说，印度尼西亚政府将发表包括关于荷兰反对印度尼西亚的颠覆和非法活动的全部证据的白皮书，以使世界知道真相。
