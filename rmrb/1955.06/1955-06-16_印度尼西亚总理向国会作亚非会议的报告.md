    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 15th: Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo delivered a government report to the Parliament on the Asian-African Conference on the 14th.

    Sastroamidjojo, pointing out the significant achievements of the Asian-African Conference, stated that the Indonesian government considers the following results to be the most important: "First, it opened the way for close cooperation between Asian and African countries in economic and cultural fields;

    "Second, the victory of tolerance, goodwill, and common sense in the common effort to achieve world peace based on the ten principles of the Bandung Declaration;

    "Third, the condemnation and denunciation of colonialism."

    Sastroamidjojo pointed out that the conference did not become a battlefield of the Cold War, as some groups may have hoped. He said, "The conference eased international tensions, which were escalating before the conference was held." He said it proved that the system of joint consultation and agreement could be used in large-scale international conferences and achieve good results. He also said: "The fact that twenty-nine Asian and African countries with different social forms, economic systems, and national organizations met together is, in fact, the practice of peaceful coexistence."

    He said, "The practical results of the Asian-African Conference in terms of economic cooperation, cultural and social cooperation, and politics can be found in the final communiqué of the conference."

    Sastroamidjojo said, "The political issue of direct importance to Indonesia is the West Irian issue. The Asian-African Conference adopted a resolution on the West Irian issue based on its anti-colonialist stance." He said that this resolution meant that the Asian-African Conference unanimously approved Indonesia's attitude on this issue.

    He said that during the conference, Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his willingness to hold direct negotiations with the United States on the issue of the Taiwan region. "Therefore, the Asian-African Conference has in fact opened the way for the peaceful settlement of the Taiwan region issue."

    Sastroamidjojo pointed out that another important event that occurred at the same time and place as the conference, but outside the conference room, was the conclusion of a treaty on dual nationality between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China. He said, "This treaty is very important for both Indonesia and the People's Republic of China because it means that the relics of the past have been cleared away." He added, "The signing of the treaty once again demonstrated the atmosphere of peace and sincerity among the countries participating in the conference."

    In his report, he reviewed the circumstances of the Asian-African Conference, from considering holding the conference to the end of the conference, and the role played by Indonesia as the initiator and host of the conference.

    Sastroamidjojo concluded: "Due to the success of the Asian-African Conference, the Indonesian nation has completed a historical task. But this does not mean that Indonesia's responsibility is over. The road of history has no end, and there is still a long way to go before us, which is to implement and realize all the results achieved by the Asian-African Conference. The implementation of the results of the Asian-African Conference has been considered and planned, and for this purpose, the establishment of a permanent institution has been considered. Indonesia will tirelessly carry out our mission and do our best to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference."

    印度尼西亚总理向国会作亚非会议的报告
    新华社雅加达十五日电　印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约十四日向国会作了关于亚非会议的政府报告。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约指出亚非会议的重大成就说，印度尼西亚政府认为下列结果是最重要的：“第一，打开了亚非各国之间在经济和文化方面进行密切合作的道路；
    “第二，在根据万隆宣言十项原则来获致世界和平的共同努力中，容忍、善意和常识的胜利；
    “第三，对殖民主义的谴责和申斥。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约指出，这个会议没有成为冷战的战场，像某些集团可能希望的那样。他说，“会议使国际紧张局势得到了缓和，这种紧张局势在会议举行以前是在日益加剧的。”他说，它证明，共同协商和共同协议的制度是能够用于大规模的国际会议并且收到良好的效果的。他又说：“不同社会形式、经济制度和国家组织的二十九个亚非国家在一起开会一事，事实上就是和平共处的实践。”
    他说，“亚非会议在经济合作、文化和社会合作方面以及在政治方面的实际结果可以在会议的最后公报中找到。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，“对印度尼西亚有直接重要意义的政治问题是西伊里安问题。亚非会议根据反殖民主义的态度通过了关于西伊里安问题的决议。”他说，这个决议意味着亚非会议一致赞成印度尼西亚在这个问题上所采取的态度。
    他说，在会议期间，周恩来总理表示愿意就台湾地区的问题同美国举行直接谈判。“因此，亚非会议事实上为台湾地区的问题的和平解决开辟了道路。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约指出，在会议举行的同时和同一个地点，但在会议室外发生的另一个重要的事件，就是印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国之间缔结了关于双重国籍的条约。他说，“这个条约对于印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国都是非常重要的，因为它意味着过去的遗物被清除了。”他又说，“条约的签订再一次表现了参加会议的各国中间的和平和真诚的气氛。”
    他在报告中回顾了亚非会议，从考虑召开这个会议一直到这个会议结束的情况，和印度尼西亚作为会议发起国和主人在会议上所起的作用。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约最后说：“由于亚非会议的成功，印度尼西亚民族完成了一项历史任务。但这并不意味着印度尼西亚的责任已经完了。历史的道路是没有终点的，在我们面前仍然有长远的道路要走，那就是执行和实现亚非会议所获得的所有的结果。对于亚非会议的结果的执行已经加以考虑和计划，而且为了这个目的，已经考虑设立常设机构。印度尼西亚将不倦地执行我们的任务，尽我们一切的努力来执行亚非会议的决议。”
