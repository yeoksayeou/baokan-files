Hu Feng is an anti-Party, anti-people counter-revolutionary element, our enemy.

Who opposes the Chinese Communist Party the most? Who fears the Chinese people breaking the shackles of imperialism, achieving liberation, gaining independence and freedom, and building a prosperous and happy socialist country the most?

Only the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism and the Kuomintang traitor group of Chiang Kai-shek that it supports – this is something we all clearly understand.

And Hu Feng? He is precisely such a fellow.

The Chinese Communist Party is the core force leading our cause; Marxism-Leninism is the theoretical foundation guiding our thinking; the people are the masters of the country. Yet Hu Feng so viciously and stubbornly hates the Party, opposes the Party, slanders the people, and curses the people, directing the members of his reactionary clique to carry out criminal anti-Party, anti-people activities. What difference is there between him and US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitor group?

If there is any difference, it is that US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek are openly and clearly enemies of the Chinese people, while the Hu Feng clique is hiding in our people's democratic camp wearing the cloak of Marxism, using "heart-digging warfare" to oppose the Party and the people. "It is easy to dodge a spear in the open, but hard to guard against an arrow shot from the dark." Hidden enemies are more vicious, ruthless, and terrifying than open enemies, because the enemy knows that a fortress is easier to breach from within.

Therefore, I believe that Hu Feng and his clique are not only ordinary counter-revolutionaries, enemies of the people, but also the most vicious, ruthless, and terrifying enemies.

The people of Sichuan Province have also been deceived by Hu Feng, and even elected him as a deputy to the National People's Congress. How can we allow such a vicious, ruthless, and terrifying counter-revolutionary element to tarnish the glorious title of a people's representative again? I am a deputy to the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress, and I once voted for Hu Feng. I now propose, in accordance with Article 38 of the Constitution, to remove Hu Feng.

At the same time, we should thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and in accordance with Article 19 of the Constitution, resolutely suppress the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's conspiratorial activities in order to defend our people's democratic regime.

At this stage of sharp, intense, and complex class struggle, we must draw full experience and lessons from the facts of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's conspiratorial activities, raise our vigilance, and thoroughly cleanse all counter-revolutionary elements from all fronts, lest "an anthill can destroy a dike," in order to safeguard the great victory of our people's revolution.

Hu Feng is an Enemy of the People
Fan Yaofeng

I am a member of a democratic party and also a reader who loves literary works. Honestly, in the past, I didn't like Hu Feng's works. They were too difficult to understand, impossible to read through. But I always thought he was one of the left-wing writers, and considered him a progressive friend.

Since the materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party clique were revealed, initially, a question arose in my mind and the minds of some people I came into contact with: Hu Feng was merely making mistakes in literary theory, stubbornly adhering to his differing opinions. Was he a friend or an enemy? It was unclear. We even saw him more as a friend. Therefore, we were not very concerned about this issue.

Since the "Raise Vigilance, Expose Hu Feng" movement was launched nationwide, after reading the two batches of materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, on the one hand, I thoroughly recognized Hu Feng's true face, and on the other hand, I received a political lesson. I criticized my initial immature and erroneous views.

Hu Feng not only stubbornly opposed people mastering the communist worldview, opposed ideological remolding, opposed combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposed literature and art serving politics, opposed national forms, and opposed the leadership of the Party, but also organized a reactionary clique, infiltrating everywhere, and also had so-called "organizational principles," using literary work to carry out anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. From the secret letters he sent to members of his reactionary clique, people can see how he hated the Party, hated the responsible comrades of the Party and progressive writers, and hated socialism. It is worth noting that in the materials exposed so far, there is not a single mention of the literary work of the Kuomintang bandit gang reactionary clique in Taiwan, but in his letter to Zhang Zhongxiao, he told him to "read it calmly" and to pay attention to "what cannot be touched."

Such a Hu Feng and his reactionary clique, are they merely people who have made mistakes in ideology and theory? Such a Hu Feng and his followers, who hate and oppose the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist construction cause (including literary construction) led by the Party with狰狞face, are they not our people's enemies?

The anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary Hu Feng clique has one of the most cunning tricks, which is to wear the cloak of Marxism. This enemy is ferocious.

I believe that for members of our revolutionary democratic parties, drawing a line between friend and foe, and distinguishing between friend and foe, is a fundamental issue in our ideology, politics, and work. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance in all our work, be good at distinguishing those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose the revolution, those who pretend to support the Communist Party but actually oppose the Communist Party, and those who pretend to support socialism but actually oppose socialism. Only in this way can we consolidate and expand our unity and do our work well.

The Hu Feng anti-Party clique is our enemy! Opposing the Hu Feng anti-Party clique is the responsibility of every one of us!

Strictly Guard Against the Double-Dealers' Conspiracies and Tricks
Wang Qi

I am not a writer, nor am I a Communist Party member, but after reading the two batches of materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party clique exposed by the "People's Daily," I cannot suppress my anger. From the Chinese people's long-term struggle, I clearly know that all anti-revolutionary and anti-people enemies always point their guns at the Chinese Communist Party first; because without the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no victory of the revolution, no happiness for the masses, and nothing for the people.

The published materials fully expose that Hu Feng is a political schemer who has been deliberately plotting against the Party and the people, and the Hu Feng clique is a counter-revolutionary clique with leadership, organization, plans, steps, an action program, and strategies and tactics. His followers are distributed in many places such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou..., infiltrating literary and art groups, publishing houses, newspapers, schools, and state organs, and even planting spies within the Party in a planned way to steal documents and collect intelligence. As far as I know, Xie Tao, a backbone member and "advisor" of the Hu Feng clique, is one of them. From the second half of 1954 until the exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique materials, Xie Tao served as a teacher of the "Basics of Marxism-Leninism" course in the amateur political schools for cadres of the headquarters of various democratic parties, the Beijing Municipal Branch, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. In the classroom, he only "objectively" narrated historical facts, but people could not feel a trace of enthusiasm for the cause of the Party. He only gesticulated and boasted endlessly about how "proficient" he was in Marxism, but one could not smell a bit of Party spirit. At that time, the students also raised some opinions several times, but he ignored them all. His arrogance and recklessness were exactly the same as those of other Hu Feng clique members. After the publication of the second batch of materials, we realized that Xie Tao's words and deeds were not accidental. This aroused great anger among the students and gave us a profound education. In the future, we must raise our vigilance a hundredfold, strictly guard against those double-dealers who stick the label of Marxism-Leninism on themselves but peddle anti-Marxist-Leninist private goods, expose their conspiracies and tricks, and eliminate the toxins they spread.

Hu Feng once called the place where he lived a "snake pit," and Hu Feng is indeed a veritable venomous snake. It is said that there is a kind of snake that is very cunning. When it has an opportunity, it opens its bloody mouth wide and is very fierce; but when people have already discovered it and surrounded it, it lies on the ground pretending to be dead, and even sheds "devil's tears." But if you think it is harmless and pitiful, you are completely wrong. It will bite you back when you are unprepared and kill you. Therefore, do not be fooled, deceived, or slackened by the false self-criticisms of Hu Feng and Hu Feng clique members, as well as similar tactics of "retreating to advance"; learn from Mr. Lu Xun's tenacious fighting spirit, carry the struggle against the Hu Feng anti-Party clique through to the end, thoroughly clarify all their counter-revolutionary relations, peel off their colorful painted skins, and smash their man-eating snake teeth. We will never stop until we win complete victory!

Fight the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique to the End
Yu Ling

In my sickbed, reading day after day the materials published in the "People's Daily" exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary clique, as well as the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's conspiratorial activities exposed and denounced by various newspapers and all sides, I repeatedly cannot suppress my recuperating nature of fighting against the disease for half a year. I am angry!

The harm of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to our revolutionary cause is exactly the same as the germs and tumors that endanger our health.

How insufficiently vigilant we have been about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's conspiracy for the past twenty years! We had doubts about him in the past, but it has always been just doubts. In 1941 in Hong Kong and in 1942 in the Dongjiang Guerrilla Area of Guangdong, he had "cleverly" plotted to undermine unity and sow discord on our literary and art front. Looking back today, how Hu Feng has utilized our kindness and goodness, utilizing that we have always regarded him as a "fellow traveler."

During the War of Resistance Against Japan in Chongqing, and in Shanghai after Japan surrendered, judging only from the aspect of drama work, the Hu Feng and his clique members always negated everything with sarcasm and ridicule for our scripts and performances, and scolded to the end. For plays with strong realistic significance and enthusiastically supported by the audience, they always said that this was "selling laughter of life," "slogans," "superficial," and "not art." At that time, the plays that most strongly exposed the dark faces of the reactionaries and criticized the Kuomintang fascist rule, such as "Qingming Before and After" and "A Careerist's Progress" etc., were precisely the main objects of attack and slander by the Hu Feng clique. After liberation, during the criticism movement of "The Life of Wu Xun," due to the Geng Yong, Zhang Yu, Luo Luo, Luo Shi and others of the Hu Feng clique in Shanghai resisting and sabotaging in every possible way, when the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture Art Department organized a meeting to fight back against them, Liu Xuewei personally called in the name of the Literary and Art Department of the Party Committee Propaganda Department and ordered the meeting to be stopped. When the Actors' Troupe of Shanghai Film Studio rehearsed and performed the plays "Heroic Battlefield," as well as "Women Representatives," "Before the Wheat Harvest" and other plays two years ago, Hu Feng elements "taught" that: "It is simply inexplicable to perform these plays,乱弹琴!"

Today, the Hu Feng clique's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiracy has finally been exposed. This is a great victory in our literary and art front, that is, in the entire revolutionary cause. The Party Central Committee is educating us with mature and ever-victorious fighting experience and has sharpened our fighting eyes. We must strengthen unity and raise political vigilance to fight the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to the end.

Must Investigate Clearly
Li Wei

From Hu Feng's articles written over the years, from his "Opinions" to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, from his "My Self-Criticism," especially from the two batches of materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party clique published in the "People's Daily" on May 13th and May 24th, people can clearly see that: The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a swindler in the literary world, a poisonous snake on the ideological front, and a political double-dealer - in the final analysis, they are counter-revolutionary spies hidden in the revolutionary ranks!

This poisonous snake drilled into the revolutionary ranks, not only climbed up to the revolutionary literary world, but also climbed into agencies, climbed into the army, climbed into the Party and people's organizations, where it engaged in counter-revolutionary underground activities, established "strongholds," expanded "positions," sharpened "swords," waited for "opportunities," and prepared to cut off heads and smash the "iron walls" of the revolution!

Everyone must be vigilant! Hu Feng adopted the tactics of the chameleon mentioned in the History of the CPSU(B) in dealing with the Party's well-intentioned criticisms, dealing with the literary and art rectification, and dealing with the current struggle against him. Hu Feng is an out-and-out double-dealer!

For example, at the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, Comrade Feng Xuefeng revealed such a thing: Hu Feng had spread rumors to Mr. Lu Xun in 1936, saying that someone in the revolutionary literary and art circles had slandered Mr. Lu Xun as a Trotskyite. If we connect this incident with the fact that Mr. Lu Xun received documents and publications sent to him by Trotskyites at that time, and connect Hu Feng's many remarks and practices, we will feel that Hu Feng has a bit of the Trotskyite gangster's stench. For example, the Hu Feng clique drilled into the revolutionary literary world, but fought the Communist Party-led literary and art army for more than 20 years with the tactics of Sun Wukong "drilling into the belly." In the past, it could openly swagger around in the Kuomintang-controlled area, and even take reactionary newspapers and periodicals as its positions; but in today's era of people's victory, he says that our literary world is "ruled by zombies," and he is looking forward to "a more distant future"; At present, when Hu Feng is spurned by everyone, Taiwan radio cheers for him... We also feel that Hu Feng is intimately connected with the deadly enemies of the Chinese people.

Therefore, we must investigate the counter-revolutionary crimes and background of the Hu Feng clique clearly, and we can and must investigate them clearly!

Must Resolutely and Thoroughly Defeat the Hu Feng Reactionary Conspiracy Clique
Xu Xiaobing

From this political conspiracy event in which the Party and the people exposed Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities, everyone can clearly see that this Hu Feng, who has always claimed to be a "disciple of Lu Xun" and pretended to be a "revolutionary writer," is actually a thorough and incorrigible evil spirit, and the face of this evil spirit is so base, filthy, hideous, and terrifying that it is truly frightening and chilling.

I fully support the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on dealing with the Hu Feng reactionary clique, revoking all public positions held by Hu Feng, and dealing with him as a counter-revolutionary element in accordance with the law. We must severely punish Hu Feng, such a demon king who has a strict reactionary organization and a long-term counter-revolutionary plan, and whose consistent anti-Party and anti-people crimes are obvious.

We admit: the painted skin of evil spirits is easy to confuse people. Over the past twenty years, many people have been fooled, deceived, and poisoned in front of Hu Feng's painted skin! Some were bought off by Hu Feng.

The eyes of the Party and the people are discerning. Today, the Party and the people have torn off Hu Feng's painted skin and revealed his true colors. Hu Feng's political conspiracy has been exposed! However, we must still be vigilant, because in the ideological field of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, there is still the reactionary ideological influence of Hu Feng, and there are still Hu Feng's brokers and thugs everywhere, and there are still people who oppose Hu Feng in words but sympathize with Hu Feng in their hearts. Although I myself have not had any direct dealings with Hu Feng, I have been indirectly affected by him, so I very much need to get vaccinated and need to be disinfected. This is a series of follow-up work before us, and also a more complex and profound fighting task!

As a film worker, I deeply feel that our film industry has not fully invested in this battle under the Party's slogan of "Raise Vigilance, Expose Hu Feng." Is it possible that there is no ideological influence of Hu Feng, no Hu Feng's brokers and thugs in our film industry; no people who oppose Hu Feng in words but sympathize with Hu Feng in their hearts? Our film industry should and must actively participate in this battle. (Attached picture)

    坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    坚决镇压胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动
    张志和
    胡风是反党、反人民的反革命分子，是我们的敌人。
    谁最反对中国共产党？谁最怕中国人民打断帝国主义的枷锁获得解放、获得独立自由并建成繁荣幸福的社会主义国家？
    只有以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略阵营和它所豢养的走狗蒋介石卖国集团的分子们，这是我们大家都十分明白的。
    胡风呢？正是这样的家伙。
    中国共产党，是领导我们事业的核心力量；马克思列宁主义，是指导我们思想的理论基础；人民是国家的主人；而胡风竟这样恶毒地、顽强地痛恨党、敌视党、污蔑人民、诅咒人民，指挥他反动集团的人们进行反党、反人民的罪恶活动，他同美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团还有点什么区别呢？
    倘要说有点区别的话，那就是美帝国主义和蒋介石是公开地、明白地同中国人民为敌，而胡风集团是披着马克思主义的外衣隐藏在我们人民民主阵营里用“挖心战”来反党、反人民的。“明枪易躲、暗箭难防”，隐藏的敌人，比公开的敌人，要恶毒、凶狠、可怕得多。因为敌人深知堡垒要从内部进攻才容易攻破。
    所以我认为胡风和他的集团不仅是一般的反革命分子、人民的敌人，而且是最恶毒、最凶狠、最可怕的敌人。
    我们四川省人民也受了胡风的欺骗，还选出他为全国人民代表大会代表。这样恶毒、凶狠、可怕的反革命分子，我们怎能让他再玷污我们人民代表这一光荣称号呢？我是四川省人民代表大会代表，我曾投过胡风一票，我现在建议依照宪法第三十八条撤换胡风。
    同时，我们应该彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，并依照宪法第十九条坚决镇压胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动，以保卫我们人民民主政权。
    我们在这阶级斗争尖锐激烈而复杂的阶段，必须从胡风反革命集团阴谋活动的事实中取得充分的经验和教训，提高警惕，把任何反革命分子从各个战线上严肃地清洗出去，免得“一蚁溃堤”，以保卫我们人民革命的伟大的胜利。
    胡风是人民的敌人
    范尧峰
    我是民主党派的成员，也是爱好文艺作品的读者。老实说，过去对于胡风的作品，却并不喜欢，它实在使人难懂，无法卒读。不过总以为他是左翼作家之一，当他是一个进步的朋友。
    自从胡风反党集团的材料揭露以来，最初，我和我所接触的一些人，思想上出现了一个问题：胡风不过是在文艺理论上犯了错误，错误地坚持他的不同意见，是朋友还是敌人，是模糊不清的。甚至把他看成朋友的成分较多。因此，并不十分关心这个问题。
      “提高警惕，揭露胡风”的运动在全国展开以来，看了胡风反党集团的两批材料以后，对我来说，一方面彻底认清了胡风的真面目，一方面对自己上了一个政治课。我批判了自己最初看法的幼稚和错误。
    胡风不仅顽固地反对人们掌握共产主义世界观，反对思想改造，反对同工农兵结合，反对文艺为政治服务，反对民族形式，反对党的领导。而且组织了反动集团，四面八方，无孔不入，还有所谓
  “组织原则”，利用文艺工作，进行反党、反人民、反革命活动。从他给他的反动集团分子的密信里，人们可以看到他是怎样地仇视党，仇视党的负责同志和进步作家，仇视社会主义。值得注意的是在他到目前为止暴露的材料里，没有一句提到台湾蒋匪帮反动集团的文艺工作，却在给张中晓的信里叫他“冷静地读它”，要他注意“不能涉及的是什么”。
    这样的一个胡风及其反动集团，岂仅止是思想上、理论上犯错误的人？这样一个以狰狞面目仇恨、反对中国共产党，反对党所领导的社会主义建设事业（包括文艺建设）的胡风及其党羽，难道还不是我们人民的敌人？
    反党反人民反革命的胡风集团，它还有一种最狡猾的伎俩，便是披着马克思主义的外衣，这个敌人是凶恶的。
    我认为，我们革命的民主党派的成员，要划清敌友，鉴别敌友，这是我们思想上、政治上、工作上的根本问题。我们必须在各项工作中保持高度的警惕性，善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子，伪装拥护共产党而实际反对共产党的分子，伪装拥护社会主义而实际反对社会主义的分子。这样才能巩固扩大我们的团结，做好我们的工作。
    胡风反党集团是我们的敌人！反对胡风反党集团是我们每个人民的责任！
    严防两面派的阴谋诡计
    王旗
    我不是一个作家，也不是一个共产党员，但是，我看过了“人民日报”所揭发的关于胡风反党集团的两批材料之后，怎么也压抑不住自己的愤怒。我从中国人民的长期斗争中，清楚地知道：一切反革命反人民的敌人，总是首先把枪口对准中国共产党的；因为没有中国共产党，就没有革命的胜利，就没有大众的幸福，就没有人民的一切。
    已公布的材料充分暴露胡风是一个处心积虑反党反人民的政治阴谋家，胡风集团是一个有领导、有组织、有计划、有步骤、有行动纲领、有战略战术的反革命集团。他的党羽分布在北京、上海、天津、杭州……许多地方，钻进了文艺团体、出版社、报社、学校和国家机关，甚至有计划地在党内安插坐探，偷窃文件，刺探情报。据我所知道的，胡风集团的骨干和“顾问”谢韬，就是其中之一。从一九五四年下半年到胡风反党集团材料被揭发以前，谢韬曾经在各民主党派总部、北京市分部、全国工商联机关干部业余政治学校担任“马克思列宁主义基础”课程，他在课堂上只是“客观”地叙述历史事实，却使人感觉不到一丝一毫对党的事业的热情，只是指手划脚、滔滔不绝地吹嘘和卖弄他个人对马克思主义如何“精通”，却嗅不到一星半点党性的气味。当时学员们也曾经提过几次意见，但他一概置之不理，其飞扬跋扈、狂妄恣肆，和其他胡风集团分子是一模一样的。第二批材料公布以后，我们才了解到谢韬的这些言行，并不是偶然的。这引起了同学们极大的愤怒，也使我们受到深刻的教育。我们今后一定要百倍地提高警惕，严防那些贴着马克思列宁主义商标、贩卖反马克思列宁主义私货的两面派，揭破他们的阴谋诡计，肃清他们散布的毒素。
    胡风曾经把自己居住的地方叫做“蛇窟”，而胡风也的确是一条名符其实的毒蛇。据说有一种蛇是很狡猾的，它在有机可乘的时候就张大血口，其势汹汹；但当人们已经发觉并且包围起来以后，就挺在地下装死，甚至流出“魔鬼的眼泪”。但假如你以为它是无害而且可怜的，那就完全错了，它会趁你不备，反咬一口，制你死命。因此，对于胡风及胡风集团分子的假检讨，以及诸如此类“以退为进”的策略，千万不要上当，不要受骗，不要松懈；要学习鲁迅先生的韧性战斗精神，把对胡风反党集团的斗争进行到底，彻底弄清他们的一切反革命关系，剥掉五颜六色的画皮，砸碎吃人的蛇牙，不获全胜，决不收兵！
    同胡风反革命集团斗争到底
    于伶
    在病床上，一天天读到“人民日报”上发表的揭露胡风反党、反人民、反革命集团的材料，以及各报各方面揭露和声讨胡风反革命集团阴谋活动的罪行，我一次次压抑不住半年来和疾病做斗争的养病性子，我愤怒！
    胡风反革命集团对于我们革命事业的危害，完全和危害我们身体健康的毒菌毒瘤一样。
    我们二十年来对胡风反革命集团的阴谋，是如何的不够警觉呀！过去对他就曾有过怀疑，可是一直仅仅是怀疑而已。一九四一年在香港、一九四二年在广东东江游击区，他都曾在我们文艺战线上“巧妙地”阴谋破坏团结，进行过挑拨离间。今天回想起来，胡风竟是如何利用了我们的厚道和善良，利用了我们一直把他当作同路的“人”看待。
    在抗战期间的重庆，在日本投降后的上海，单从戏剧工作方面看，对于我们的剧本和演出，胡风及其集团分子总是冷嘲热讽地否定一切，谩骂到底。凡是现实意义强的、为观众所热烈拥护的戏，他们总是说这是“生活的卖笑”、“标语口号”、“浅薄”、“不是艺术”。当时最强烈地暴露反动派黑暗面貌、抨击国民党法西斯统治的戏如“清明前后”和“升官图”等，却正是胡风集团攻击和诋毁的主要对象。解放以后，“武训传”批判运动中，由于在上海的胡风集团分子耿庸、张禹、罗洛、罗石等的百般抗拒和破坏，上海市文化局艺术处组织会议来进行反击他们时，刘雪苇竟以党委宣传部文艺处名义，亲自打电话命令停止会议的召开。前年上海电影制片厂的演员剧团排演出了“英雄阵地”，以及“妇女代表”，“麦收之前”等剧目时，胡风分子“教训”说：“演出这些戏简直是莫名其妙，乱弹琴！”
    今天胡风集团的反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋，终于被揭露了，这是我们文艺战线上，也即是整个革命事业中的一大胜利。党中央以成熟的战无不胜的斗争经验教育我们，擦亮了我们的战斗眼睛。我们必须加强团结，提高政治警惕，来对胡风反革命集团斗争到底。
    必须追查清楚
    李伟
    从胡风多年来所写的文章当中，从他的给中共中央的“意见书”当中，从他的“我的自我批判”当中，特别是从“人民日报”五月十三日和五月二十四日发表的关于胡风反党集团的两批材料当中，人们可以清清楚楚地看得出来：胡风反革命集团是文坛上的骗子，思想战线上的毒蛇，政治上的两面派——归根到底，他们是隐藏在革命队伍中的反革命奸细！
    这条毒蛇钻进革命的队伍里，不仅爬上革命文坛，还爬进机关，爬进军队，爬进党和人民团体，在那里从事反革命的地下活动，在那里建立“据点”，扩大“阵地”，磨着“利剑”，等待“时机”，准备割下头颅，击碎革命的“铁壁”！
    大家要警惕啊！胡风在对付党对他们的善意批评，对付文艺整风和对付目前向他展开的斗争时，正是采用了联共（布）党史中所说的变色的蜥蜴的作法的。胡风是地地道道的两面派！
    比如说，在中国文联主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议上，冯雪峰同志揭露了这么一件事：胡风在一九三六年曾向鲁迅先生造谣，说是革命文艺界中有人污蔑鲁迅先生是托派。如果把这件事和当时鲁迅先生收到托派寄给他的文件、刊物联系起来看，把胡风的许多言论、作法联系起来看，就会觉得胡风有那么一股子托洛茨基匪徒的臭味。再比如说，胡风集团钻进革命文坛，却同共产党所领导的文艺大军用孙悟空“钻进肚皮”的战术打了二十多年仗，过去在国民党统治区可以公开晃来晃去，甚至拿反动报刊作阵地；而到今天人民胜利的时代，他却说我们的文坛是“僵尸统治的”，他期待着“更远大的未来”；目前当胡风被大家所唾弃的时候，台湾广播却为他喝彩……我们又觉得胡风和中国人民的死敌是脉脉相通。
    因此，对于胡风集团的反革命罪行及其背景，我们必须追查清楚，而且一定可以追查清楚！
    必须坚决彻底打垮胡风反动阴谋集团
    徐肖冰
    从这次党和人民揭露胡风反党、反人民、反革命的政治阴谋事件中，谁都可以看清楚这个一向自称“鲁迅信徒”并俨然以“革命作家”自居的胡风，原来是一个彻头彻尾、顽固不化的恶鬼，而这个恶鬼的嘴脸如此卑鄙龌龊，如此狰狞可怕，真是令人毛骨悚然，不寒而栗。
    我完全拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议关于处理胡风反动集团的决议，撤销胡风所担承的一切公众职务，并把他作为反革命分子来依法处理。我们对胡风这样一个有严密的反动组织和长远的反革命计划、一贯反党、反人民罪证昭著的魔王，必须依法严惩。
    我们承认：恶鬼的画皮是容易迷惑人的。二十年来有过不少人在胡风的画皮面前上当、受骗、中毒了！有的被胡风收买了。
    党和人民的眼睛是雪亮的，今天，党和人民已经撕掉了胡风的画皮，而使他原形毕露了，胡风的政治阴谋已经暴露了！但是，我们还必须提高警惕，因为在小资产阶级知识分子的思想领域中还有胡风的反动思想影响，到处还有胡风的掮客和打手，还有口头上反对胡风但内心是同情胡风的人们。像我自己虽然没有和胡风直接打过什么交道，可是也间接地受到过影响，因此就非常需要打防疫针，需要消毒。这是摆在我们面前的一系列的善后工作，也是一个更加复杂、更加深刻的战斗任务！
    我作为一个电影工作者，切身地感到我们电影界还没有在党的“提高警惕，揭露胡风”的口号下，全部投入这个战斗。难道在我们电影界没有胡风的思想影响，没有胡风的掮客和打手；没有口头上反对胡风但内心是同情胡风的人们吗？我们电影界完全应该也必须积极参加这次战斗。（附图片）
