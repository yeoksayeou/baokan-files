Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 18th: Vietnam News Agency reported: At a meeting of the Lao National Assembly and the Lao Royal Council on June 9th, it was decided to postpone the date of the general election scheduled by the Royal Government for August 28th of this year to December 25th. The voting result was: 31 votes in favor, 4 votes against, and 4 abstentions.

The "Liberation Newspaper," the organ of the Lao Free National United Front, commented on this matter, saying: "The conspiracy of the US imperialists and their servants to hastily hold a one-sided general election without the participation of the Lao combat forces has initially failed." This is a victory for the Lao people.

The "Liberation Newspaper" then praised the efforts of some patriotic and far-sighted members of the Royal National Assembly and reminded that this is only the first failure of the saboteurs who are still striving to realize their perfidious conspiracy.

The "Liberation Newspaper" demanded the resumption of political conferences in order to conclude an agreement on holding free and fair general elections in accordance with the final declaration of the Geneva Conference.

    老挝国民议会和王室议会
    决定把普选日期推迟到年底
    新华社河内十八日电　越南通讯社报道：六月九日，在老挝国民议会和老挝王室议会举行的一次会议上，决定把王国政府预定在今年八月二十八日举行普选的日期推迟到十二月二十五日。投票结果是：三十一票赞成，四票反对，四票弃权。
    寮国自由民族统一战线机关报“解放报”就这件事发表评论说：“美帝国主义者及其仆从想不让寮国战斗部队参加而急忙举行片面普选的阴谋已初步遭到失败。”对于老挝人民来说，这是一个胜利。
      “解放报”接着称赞王国国民议会若干爱国而有远见的议员的努力，并且提醒说，但是，这只不过是仍在努力实现其背信阴谋的破坏者们的第一个失败。
      “解放报”要求恢复政治会议，以便按照日内瓦会议最后宣言缔结一项关于举行自由而公正的普选的协议。
