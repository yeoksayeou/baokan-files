    Conscientiously Implement This Year's College Enrollment Policy of "Ensuring Quality, Considering Quantity"
    Zhang Jian
    This year’s college enrollment policy is "ensuring quality, considering quantity." Specifically, it requires admitting new students who are politically reliable, have adequate scientific and cultural knowledge, and are physically capable of persevering in their studies. As in previous years, this year colleges and universities should vigorously recruit young worker-peasant cadres and children of workers and peasants. Young cadres from government organizations are allowed to apply, but the admission requirements cannot be lowered.
    Why should colleges and universities emphasize appropriately improving the quality of new students this year?
    Past years of experience have taught us that if the quality of new students cannot be guaranteed to a certain extent, colleges and universities cannot successfully complete the task of cultivating talent for construction. For example, according to statistics from the end-of-year report of colleges and universities for the 1953-1954 academic year, a total of 7,478 students left school during that year due to illness, inability to keep up with classes, or other reasons (including suspension of studies, withdrawal, etc.), accounting for 3.53% of the total number of students enrolled. Among them, 3,755 were on sick leave for recuperation, accounting for 50.2% of the total attrition. Calculating that each student costs the state between 1,000 and 1,500 yuan per year (including capital construction costs), the departure of these students from school would result in a loss to the state of between 7.47 million and 11.21 million yuan. Although a certain amount of student attrition is inevitable in any country’s higher education system, and it's impossible to train every 100 students recruited into 100 cadres, such a high attrition rate is clearly too large, indicating that we have not paid enough attention to the quality of new students in the past, especially regarding physical examinations. In addition, the phenomenon of student attrition due to inadequate cultural and scientific knowledge levels in various colleges and universities is also quite serious. For example, according to Tsinghua University's analysis and statistics on student attrition, in 1952, the admission standards for new students' academic examination scores were relatively low, resulting in 249 out of the 872 new students admitted that year being subject to attrition (including grade repetition) by the 1954-1955 academic year, accounting for 29% of the total number of new students enrolled in 1952. Materials from some colleges and universities indicate that some students recruited in the past who were of poorer political quality did not study hard on weekdays, and even if they managed to complete their studies, it was difficult to assign them to work. A few were even expelled for extremely bad moral character and repeated failures to reform. Based on the above situation, colleges and universities must appropriately improve the quality of new students in the future in order to cultivate senior construction talents that meet the requirements of national construction.
    We are now also initially equipped with the conditions to appropriately improve the quality of new students. To improve the quality of new students, we must first expand the sources of students. Due to the lagging development of high schools compared to the enrollment needs of colleges and universities, high school graduates in the past three years have only been able to meet 50% to 70% of the enrollment numbers of colleges and universities, thus restricting the improvement of the quality of new students to a certain extent. However, the situation has changed greatly this year. The number of high school graduates nationwide will reach 100% of the enrollment numbers of colleges and universities. In addition, many primary school teachers, secondary vocational school graduates, young cadres from government organizations, demobilized soldiers, and social educated youth are applying for colleges and universities. It is expected that the student source for colleges and universities this year may be more abundant than in any year since the founding of the People's Republic of China, providing more room for selection.
    A certain student source is only an important condition for improving the quality of new students. In order to ensure the quality of new students, we must also actively improve enrollment methods. Starting now, relevant departments in various localities should, in accordance with the spirit of the "Decision on Ensuring the Completion of the 1954 National College Enrollment Plan" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 20, 1954, strive to mobilize this year's graduating senior high school students, some secondary vocational school graduates, primary school teachers, and young cadres in government organizations and groups with senior high school graduation or equivalent qualifications to apply for various types of colleges and universities. Social educated youth who meet the conditions should also be allowed to apply in order to increase the student source for colleges and universities in all aspects. It should be emphasized here that young cadres in government organizations and demobilized soldiers who are under 30 years old, healthy, and have a senior high school graduation or equivalent qualification should be encouraged to apply for colleges and universities as much as possible and given active support and enthusiastic assistance. Allowing these young cadres to apply for colleges and universities can not only actively change the composition of college students, but also provide these cadres with opportunities for further study, and also reduce the staffing of government organizations. The leadership of various government organizations and groups should actively help them solve the problem of time for reviewing and making up lessons and other difficulties, and provide them with convenience for applying for colleges and universities.
    Secondly, candidates should be organized to review and make up lessons according to the "1955 Summer College Enrollment Examination Syllabus" compiled by the Ministry of Higher Education. The "Examination Syllabus" includes ten courses. Due to the tight schedule and in order to reduce the learning burden on candidates, the Ministry of Higher Education has decided not to test Russian and English for the time being. The number of subjects required for various professional applications generally does not exceed five. In this way, candidates can concentrate on reviewing the courses that are directly related to their applications. In order to guide candidates in their review of relevant courses, each unit should, as far as possible, invite local high school teachers, college graduates from government organizations and groups, and engineering and technical personnel from factories and mining enterprises to give candidates systematic, simple, and clear explanations of the contents of the "Examination Syllabus" in a concise manner. Appropriate consideration should be given to the learning time required by candidates for reviewing the "Examination Syllabus". Candidates should be guided and helped to arrange their study and cultural and recreational activities appropriately, striving to ensure that they can both review their lessons and maintain their health; practices such as intensive cramming and staying up late that are detrimental to their health should be prevented.
    Local medical and health departments should conduct physical examinations of candidates seriously and strictly, and must prevent people with illnesses from applying; for those who are healthy but have certain physiological defects and can only apply for certain majors, this must be clearly stated on the physical examination form. The studies in various majors in colleges and universities are intensive and complex. People who are ill or too weak cannot persist in long-term study. If they drop out or suspend their studies midway due to poor health, it will cause waste to the country and be detrimental to the individual. Therefore, candidates should also adopt a serious and responsible attitude towards the state and themselves regarding their physical examinations.
    When evaluating candidates' scores, the admission standards should be appropriately raised so that new students meet the requirements of having adequate cultural and scientific knowledge and being able to keep up with classes. In this way, the scores of subjects directly related to various majors must meet certain standards. For example, the examination scores of mathematics, physics, and chemistry for new science and engineering students must meet certain standards, the examination scores of biology, physics, and chemistry for new agriculture, forestry, and medical students must meet certain standards, and the examination scores of Chinese language, political common sense, and history for new liberal arts, political science, law, and economics students must meet certain standards. In order to implement the policy of "ensuring quality, considering quantity," in addition to admitting formal new students who fully meet the requirements for improving quality, a certain number of probationary students who are basically able to keep up with classes should also be admitted. That is to say, for candidates who are qualified in terms of political and health conditions but whose examination scores are slightly lower than the admission standards, schools may admit them as probationary students if there are vacancies. The probationary period is one semester or one academic year. Those who cannot keep up with classes during the probationary period will have their probationary status revoked; those who pass the semester examination after the probationary period will be converted into formal students. The admission standards for worker-peasant cadres, children of workers and peasants, and industrial workers applying for admission cannot be lowered either (facts have proven that artificially lowering standards cannot guarantee quality). Basically, the principle of giving priority to admission under the same conditions should be implemented.
    After the examination is over, when planning the distribution of new students, it is necessary to implement the principle of giving as much consideration as possible to individual aspirations under the premise of ensuring the overall needs of the country's socialist construction. First of all, candidates are required to comprehensively see that all aspects of the motherland's socialist construction need to cultivate certain senior construction talents, and they must choose their college aspirations according to the needs of national construction. On the other hand, the state should give as much consideration as possible to individual college aspirations when carrying out planned distribution. Regarding the issue of how new college students should fill out their applications this year, the following methods are planned to be adopted: 1. Focus on filling out professional applications. After the professional applications are determined, schools that offer this major can be appropriately selected. 2. Planned distribution should be implemented when admission cannot be made according to the application. During the distribution, the enrollment agency should consider the possibility of the student's studies after enrollment in conjunction with the student's conditions. Students should consciously obey the distribution.
    This year's college enrollment work has many favorable conditions, such as a large number of applicants, rich experience in unified enrollment work accumulated in the past, and so on; but there are also many difficulties, such as the requirement to improve the quality of new students, the relatively tight time for enrollment work, and insufficient organizational preparation after the abolition of the large administrative regions. These difficulties must be overcome. Due to the abolition of large administrative regions, this year's college enrollment work mainly relies on the relevant provincial and municipal enrollment committees and colleges and universities to be fully responsible, that is, to be specifically responsible for the physical examination, political review, college ideological education, enrollment work, and planned distribution of admitted new students in accordance with unified regulations. The staff responsible for enrollment work must clearly recognize that implementing the policy of "ensuring quality, considering quantity" is an important step in improving the quality of school education and ensuring the needs of national construction. When conducting college ideological education for candidates, the necessity of improving the quality of new students should be emphasized, and they should be educated to establish a college ideology that meets the overall needs of the motherland's socialist construction, and consciously obey the state's planned distribution. At the same time, it should be explained that when colleges and universities admit new students this year, on the one hand, they should allow candidates to study locally as much as possible in order to gradually create conditions for college students to live at home; on the other hand, some colleges and universities in the Northwest, North China, and Northeast China should still recruit a certain number of new students from East China, Central South China, and Southwest China to ensure the needs of the plan.

    认真执行今年高等学校“保证质量，照顾数量”的招生工作方针
    张健
    今年高等学校招生工作的方针是“保证质量，照顾数量”，具体说，就是要求录取政治上可靠、文化科学知识够格、身体能够坚持学习的新生。和往年一样，今年高等学校应该大力吸收工农青年干部和工农子女入学，允许机关青年干部投考，但入学的条件却不能降低。
    为什么今年高等学校要强调适当地提高招收新生的质量呢？
    过去几年来的经验告诉我们，如果不能保证新生的一定质量，高等学校就不能很好地完成培养建设人材的任务。例如根据高等学校一九五三—一九五四学年末报表的统计，在这一年内学生因病、因跟不上班或其他原因而出校的（包括休学、退学等）共有七千四百七十八人，占在校学生总数百分之三点五三。其中患病休养的三千七百五十五人，占流动总数百分之五十点二。按一个学生一年要花费国家开支的一千元到一千五百元计算（包括基本建设的费用），由于这些学生流动出校，就会给国家造成七百四十七万元到一千一百二十一万元的损失。虽然任何国家的高等学校学生都不可免地有或多或少的流动率，不能招收一百人就培养成一百个干部，但这样的流动率显然是太大了，这说明我们过去对于新生质量其中尤其是体格检查注意不够。另外，各高等学校学生因为文化科学知识水平过低而发生流动现象的情况也是相当严重的。例如根据清华大学关于学生流动情况的分析统计，一九五二年由于新生学科考试成绩录取标准较低，结果当年录取的八百七十二名新生，到一九五四—一九五五学年时，流动了（包括降级）二百四十九人，占一九五二年入学新生总人数百分之二十九。部分高等学校的材料说明，过去招收的政治质量较差的学生，有些人平日就不好好学习，即使勉强学完也很难于分配工作，个别的则因道德品质十分恶劣屡教不改而被开除学籍。根据上述情况，今后高等学校必须适当地提高新生质量，才能培养合乎国家建设要求的高级建设人材。
    现在我们也初步具备了适当地提高新生质量的条件。要提高新生质量，首先要扩大学生来源。由于高中的发展落后于高等学校的招生需要，过去三年的高中毕业生仅能达到高等学校招生数百分之五十到七十，因而提高新生质量受到一定的限制。但今年的情况已经有了很大变化，全国高中毕业生将要达到高等学校招生数百分之一百；再加上不少小学教师、中等专业学校毕业生、机关团体青年在职干部、转业军人和社会知识青年报考高等学校，预计今年高等学校的学生来源可能比建国以来的任何一年都要多一些，这就有了较多的选择余地。
    一定的学生来源，只是提高新生质量的一个重要条件。为了保证新生质量，还必须积极地改进招生办法，从现在起，各地有关部门就应当根据一九五四年五月二十日中共中央颁发的“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”精神，努力动员今年暑假高级中学应届毕业生、部分中等专业学校毕业生和小学教师以及具有高中毕业程度或同等学力的机关团体在职干部去报考各类高等学校，合乎条件的社会知识青年也要让他们报考，以便从各个方面来增加高等学校的学生来源。这里要着重说明一下：各机关团体的在职青年干部和转业军人，凡是年在三十周岁以下、身体健康、具有高中毕业或同等学力的，应尽可能地让他们去报考高等学校，并予以积极支持和热情帮助。让这些青年干部报考高等学校，既可以积极改变高等学校的学生成份，又可以使这些干部有入学深造的机会，还可以紧缩机关人员编制。各机关团体的领导方面应当主动地帮助他们解决复习和补习功课的时间以及其他困难，给他们以投考高等学校的便利。
    其次，要组织考生根据高等教育部编订的“一九五五年暑期高等学校招生考试大纲”，复习和补习功课。“考试大纲”中计有十门课程，因时间仓促并为了减轻考生的学习负担，高等教育部已经决定暂不考俄语和英语。各类专业报考的科目一般地也都不超过五门。这样，就使考生能够集中精力复习同自己报考直接有关的课程。为着指导考生对有关课程的复习，各单位应尽可能地请当地高中教师、机关团体的高等学校毕业生、厂矿企业部门的工程技术人员，根据“考试大纲”内容，提纲挈领地向考生进行系统的简单明了的讲解。对于考生复习“考试大纲”所需要的学习时间，应给予适当的照顾。要指导和帮助考生适当地安排学习和文化娱乐活动，尽力做到既能复习功课，又能保证身体健康；要防止紧张突击和开夜车等有损于身体健康的做法。
    各地医疗卫生部门要认真、严格地对考生进行体格检查，对身体有病不能报考的人必须加以阻止；对于身体健康但有某种生理缺陷只能报考某些专业的人必须在体格检查表上详细注明。高等学校各类专业的学习，都是紧张而复杂的，身体有病或体力太弱的人，无法坚持长期学习。如果因身体不好而中途退学、休学，对国家会造成浪费，对个人也很不利。因此，考生对于自己的体格检查，也应该抱着对国家对自己严肃负责的态度。
    在评定考生的成绩时，录取标准要适当地提高，使新生都合乎文化科学知识够格、能够跟班上课的要求。这样，各类专业直接有关的学科成绩就必须达到一定标准。如理工类新生的数学、物理、化学的考试成绩就须要达到一定标准，农林医药新生的生物、物理、化学的考试成绩就须要达到一定标准，文史、政法、财经等类新生的语文、政治常识、历史的考试成绩就须要达到一定标准。为着贯彻“保证质量，照顾数量”的方针，除了录取完全合乎提高质量要求的正式新生外，还要录取一定数量的基本上能够跟班上课的试读生。就是说，对于政治、健康条件合格，考试成绩稍低于录取标准的考生，遇有缺额，学校可录取为试读生。试读期限为一个学期或一学年，试读期间不能跟班上课的，取消试读资格；试读期满，经学期考试及格，转为正式生。对于工农干部、工农子女、产业工人报考入学的录取标准也不能降低（事实证明，人为地降低标准的作法，无法保证质量），基本上实行同等条件而优先录取的办法。
    考试结束，对新生进行计划分配时，必须贯彻在保证国家社会主义建设全面需要的前提下，尽可能地照顾个人志愿的原则。首先要求考生全面地看到祖国社会主义建设的各个方面都需要培养一定的高级建设人材，要根据国家建设的需要来选择升学志愿。另一方面，国家在进行计划分配时，要尽可能地照顾个人的升学志愿。关于今年高等学校新生如何填写志愿的问题，准备采取这样的办法：一、以填写专业志愿为主，在专业志愿确定以后，可以适当选择设有这种专业的学校。二、在不能按志愿录取时，要实行计划分配。分配时，招生机构要结合学生的条件，考虑其入学后学习的可能性。学生则应当自觉地服从分配。
    今年高等学校招生工作有不少有利条件，如报考人数较多，有过去积累起来的丰富的统一招生工作经验等等；但也有不少困难，如要求提高新生质量，招生工作的时间比较紧迫，在大行政区撤销以后，组织准备工作作得不够充分等等。这些困难都是必须克服的。由于大行政区撤销，今年高等学校招生工作主要地要依靠有关省、市招生委员会和高等学校全面负责，即按照统一的规定，具体负责做好考生的体格检查、政治审查、升学思想教育、招考工作和对于录取新生的计划分配工作。负责招生工作的工作人员都要明确地认识贯彻“保证质量，照顾数量”的方针，是提高学校教育质量和保证国家建设需要的重要步骤。在对考生进行升学思想教育时，应当着重说明提高新生质量的必要性，教育他们树立为了祖国社会主义建设全面需要的升学思想，自觉地服从国家的计划分配。同时要说明今年高等学校录取新生时，一方面要尽可能地让考生就地升学，以便为高等学校学生实行走读逐步地创造条件；另一方面西北、华北、东北部分高等学校仍要向华东、中南、西南地区招收一定数量的新生，以保证计划的需要。
