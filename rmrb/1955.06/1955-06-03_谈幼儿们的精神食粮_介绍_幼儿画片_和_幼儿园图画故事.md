Talking About the Spiritual Food of Young Children
——Introducing "Children's Picture Cards" and "Kindergarten Picture Stories"
Ding Jingtang

In the recent year or two, the variety of children's books has increased, and the quality has also improved. The ranks of those engaged in children's literature, writing children's science knowledge books, and creating children's picture stories and book illustrations have also continued to expand. However, at present, there is a type of spiritual food for children that is produced particularly sparsely, and even after the finished product is produced, it lacks enthusiastic care and attention to promotion and introduction. This type of spiritual food is picture stories and picture books for preschool children. Therefore, in this garden lacking cultivators and sowers, the eight kindergarten picture stories published by the Shanghai Children's Publishing House since the fourth quarter of 1954, and the four sets of sixteen large-format color children's picture cards of "We Love Small Animals," "Labor Brings Happiness," "Happy Festivals," and "Seasonal Changes," are particularly worthy of our attention from their existing achievements.

Kindergarten picture stories and children's picture cards, according to the characteristics of preschool children, use the things that children come into contact with and love in their daily lives to carry out socialist ideological education for children through color pictures. Of course, in carrying out education, it is necessary for parents, older siblings, and educators in nurseries and kindergartens to provide guidance and explanations to children, so as to help children better understand the content of picture stories and picture cards, and achieve better results.

China's children's literature's enthusiastic nanny - Mr. Lu Xun expressed his deep concern for children's books in several articles and letters. For example, in "Picture Literacy" ("Qiejieting Essays"), he made serious criticisms of the "Picture Literacy" published by the Commercial Press at that time, believing that the publisher's reprinting of the ancient book of the 34th year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1908 in the Western calendar) in November 1932 was a bad act of "intensifying the foolishness of children." The Commercial Press was the largest bookstore in the country at that time, and the children's picture books it published were: "The colors are so turbid," "The pictures are so rigid," and even worse, the things in the pictures are different from the things in real life. Mr. Lu Xun believed that the pictures for young children must be very cautious and very difficult to make. It is absolutely necessary for "some painters with practical knowledge" to be "absolutely incompetent."

Today, many children's literature authors and art authors are working together creatively to engage in this "must be very cautious" and "very difficult" project. Their efforts are rewarding.

We can see from the picture stories such as "Slide," "Xiao Ying's Collage," and "Playing with Younger Brother": The author tells children on the screen to abide by collective discipline when playing games, line up in order when sliding, and not rush to be first; in the game, they must cooperate with each other, help their mother take care of their younger brother, and not only care about playing with their friends and forget to take care of their younger brother to play together. "Brave Swallow Mom" illustrates the girl Zhenzhen's sympathy for the injured little swallow, and the swallow mom bravely protects the little swallow from being bullied by the old tabby cat, educating young children to love small animals. "In the Orchard," "Rabbits Moving House," and "Crossing the River" are three interesting picture stories. In "In the Orchard," the little flower rabbit, the little monkey, the little bear, and the elephant work together. They weed, water, loosen the soil, and prune the branches, and use their own hands to make the orchard full of flowers and the peach trees full of peaches. They surround the peach trees and happily dance and sing to celebrate the fruits of their labor. The four friends in "Crossing the River" - frog, sparrow, ant, and little rabbit - go to find their good friend rooster together; they encounter a river on the way, and the frog and sparrow help the little rabbit and ant to think of ways to "cross the river" together. They are not selfish at all. "Rabbits Moving House" describes the little rabbits using their brains to think of ways to overcome difficulties and move house in the rain.

The four sets of picture cards, as each set of titles indicates, "We Love Small Animals" and "Seasonal Changes" use vivid images to tell children to love animals and distinguish the differences between spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The screen of "Happy Festivals" is full of the joyful atmosphere of the festival and the happy emotions of the children. The children sing, dance, hold up portraits of Chairman Mao, red five-pointed stars, and flying doves of peace to march forward. The builders and defenders of the motherland's future and their fathers, brothers, mothers, and sisters - today's builders and defenders of the motherland - celebrated National Day, New Year's Day, "May Day" International Labor Day, and "June 1" International Children's Day together.

The children's images appearing on the screen are strong, lively, clean, and lovely, and are role models for children to learn from. The children's animal companions are also amiable and lovely, making it easy for children to make friends with them. In particular, Yan Gefan's paintings fully demonstrate the author's expertise in depicting various animals that children love; he is one of the art writers loved by children. "In the Orchard," "Crossing the River," "Rabbits Moving House," "Brave Swallow Mom," and the picture card "We Love Small Animals" are all painted carefully. The animals under Yan Gefan's pen are given anthropomorphic images, full of expressions and movements, and the background is also harmonious in color. For example, in picture two of "Crossing the River": the four friends - frog, sparrow, ant, and little rabbit - happily go to find their good friend rooster together. They meet a river on the way. The rabbit sits and rests his chin in his hand (foreleg) in "thought," the ant stares at the river blankly by the river, the frog sits by the river bank, half of his leg extended into the water, and he holds his stomach with both hands (forefeet), puffing up two big eyes in "brainstorming," and the sparrow also turns his head to "think of a way." The light blue river water has some ripples, and four duckweeds float on the river surface. From Yan Gefan's many paintings, it can be seen that the author has created his own unique style in children's picture books. The other authors of children's picture stories and children's picture cards, Li Tianxin, Yan Zhexi, Zhao Baishan, and Chen Qingzhi, have also achieved achievements in their own right, and will not be commented on one by one.

The printing, paper, colors, and binding of children's picture stories are also relatively exquisite among children's books. Each book is 16mo, printed in color on fine paper, and bound with colored silk thread. The book itself is a work of art. Unfortunately, because these books have not done a good job in promotion, the number of copies issued is far behind the objective needs, so that these two sets of albums and picture cards cannot play a greater role. This incident also reflects an important issue, that is, parents' attention to their children's education, although it has aroused people's attention due to large-scale publicity and education on communist moral qualities and resisting the erosion of bourgeois ideology among young people, still lacks sufficient understanding and specific methods regarding the importance of education for young children. Some parents (here mainly referring to parents with cultural education) believe that there is no need to manage the education of young children, and wait until they grow up to talk about it, and would rather let them play dirty games in the streets and alleys with runny noses, or give them a few cents to buy unsanitary snacks when they are noisy, rather than be willing to or do not know how to buy some beneficial picture stories and picture cards for children to explain and educate them.

Cultivating fighters with noble communist moral qualities requires starting from childhood. Paying close attention to the budding of socialist new people is a reliable guarantee for future harvests. Therefore, turning our wishes into practical actions and eliminating the special backwardness of a certain aspect of children's books is our glorious responsibility. The "Children's Picture Story" and "Children's Picture Card" that have already been published are small in number, and there are still some shortcomings in some pictures (such as the content is not rich enough, the images of a few children are too mature, some adult images are also too rough, some labor movements seem clumsy, etc.), but this is a garden worthy of our efforts to reclaim. We hope that the Juvenile and Children's Publishing House and the Children's Book Publishing House will appropriately expand the topic planning of children's spiritual food, and at the same time look forward to more authors, art workers, teachers, and parents paying attention to this work, just as we care about the socialist construction of the motherland.

    谈幼儿们的精神食粮
    ——介绍“幼儿画片”和“幼儿园图画故事”
    丁景唐
    最近一、二年来儿童读物的种类增多了，质量也有提高。从事儿童文学和撰写儿童科学知识书籍以及创作儿童图画故事和书籍插画的队伍也不断地有了扩大。但在目前有一类给儿童的精神食粮却生产得特别稀少，即使生产了成品之后也缺乏热情的关怀和注意推广介绍。这一类精神食粮就是供给学龄前幼年儿童阅览的图画故事和画册。因此，在这缺乏有心人耕耘和播种的园地上，上海儿童读物出版社自一九五四年第四季度以来出版的八本幼儿园图画故事和“我们爱小动物”、“劳动带来幸福”、
  “欢乐的节日”、“季节的变化”四组十六张彩色大幅的幼儿画片，从它们的现有的成绩来看，就特别值得我们注意的了。
    幼儿园图画故事和幼儿画片根据学龄前幼儿的特点，通过幼儿们日常生活所接触的和喜爱的事物，以彩色画面向幼儿们进行社会主义的思想教育。当然，在进行教育中是需要爸爸、妈妈、大哥哥、大姊姊和保育院、幼儿园的教养员向幼儿们进行辅导讲解，才能帮助幼儿们更好地了解图画故事的和画片的内容，取得更好的效果。
    中国儿童文学的热情的保姆——鲁迅先生在好几篇文章和书简中表达了对幼儿读物的深切的关怀。例如，在“看图识字”（“且介亭杂文”）中，他就对当时商务印书馆出版的“看图识字”提出严肃的批评，认为出版者在一九三二年十一月把清朝光绪三十四年（即西历一九○八年）的古籍重印，是一种“变本加厉的愚弄孩子”的恶劣行为。商务印书馆是当时国内最大的书店，而所出的儿童图画书竟是：“色彩就多么恶浊”、“图画又多么死板”，而更坏的是画中事物和现实生活中事物不同。鲁迅先生认为给幼年儿童看的图画必须十分慎重，做起来也十分烦难，是非得要“有些切实的知识的画家”是“决难胜任的”。
    今天，不少儿童文学作者和美术作者正在以创造性的劳动合作从事这个“必须十分慎重”、“十分烦难”的工程。他们的努力是有收获的。
    我们可以从“滑滑梯”、“小英剪贴”、“和弟弟一起玩”等图画故事中看到：作者在画面上告诉孩子在游戏时要遵守集体的纪律，滑滑梯要按着先后次序排队，不要抢先；在游戏中要相互合作，要帮助妈妈照顾弟弟，不要只管自己和小朋友玩而忘掉照顾小弟弟一起玩。“勇敢的燕子妈妈”说明女孩珍珍对受伤的小燕子的同情，燕子妈妈勇敢地保护了小燕子不受老花猫的欺侮，教育幼儿热爱小动物。“在果树园里”、“兔子搬家”、“过河”是三本富有兴趣的图画故事。“在果树园里”的小花兔、小猴子、小熊、大象共同劳动，它们拔草、浇水、松土、剪枝，用自己的手使果树园里开满了鲜花，桃树结满了桃子，它们围着桃树，快乐地跳舞歌唱，庆贺它们劳动得来的果实。“过河”里的四个朋友——青蛙、麻雀、蚂蚁、小兔子一同去找好朋友公鸡；它们在半路碰到一条河，青蛙和麻雀帮助小兔子和蚂蚁一起想办法“过河”，它们一点也不自私自利。“兔子搬家”描写小兔子们动脑筋想办法克服困难，在雨中搬家。
    四组画片，正如每组题目所标明了的，“我们爱小动物”、“季节的变化”选用生动的形象告诉孩子们热爱动物和辨别春、夏、秋、冬四季的不同。“欢乐的节日”的画面充满了节日的愉快气氛和孩子们的欢乐情绪。孩子们唱歌、跳舞、举起毛主席的画像、红色的五角星和飞翔的和平鸽行进。祖国的未来的建设者和保卫者和他们的父兄、母亲和姊姊——今天的祖国建设者和保卫者一起庆祝了国庆、元旦、“五一”国际劳动节和“六一”国际儿童节。
    出现在画面上的儿童形象都是强壮、活泼、清洁、可爱，是孩子们学习的榜样。儿童的动物伴侣也都是可亲可爱，容易使儿童们和它们做朋友。特别是严个凡的绘图，充分显示了作者擅长描绘各种儿童们心爱的动物；他是儿童们喜爱的美术作家之一。“在果树园里”、“过河”、“兔子搬家”、“勇敢的燕子妈妈”和画片“我们爱小动物”等都画得认真。严个凡画笔下的动物赋与拟人的形象，富有表情和动作，背景也色彩和谐。例如“过河”图二：四个朋友——青蛙、麻雀、蚂蚁、小兔子高高兴兴地一同去找好朋友公鸡，走到半路，碰到一条河，兔子坐着，用手（前腿）掌托着面腮在“思索”，蚂蚁在河边望着河水呆住了，青蛙坐在河滩边，半条腿伸在水中，双手（前脚）抱着肚子，鼓起了二支大眼在“动脑筋”，麻雀也侧转了头在“想办法”。淡蓝色的河水有些涟漪，河面上飘着四片浮萍。由严个凡的许多绘画看来，作者在儿童图画读物中已创造了自己的特有风格。幼儿图画故事和幼儿画片的其他几位作者李天心、严折西、赵白山、陈清之也是各有成就的，不一一评述。
    幼儿图画故事的印刷、纸张、色彩、装订也是儿童读物中较为精美的。每本十六开、道林纸、彩色精印，用彩色丝线装订。书的本身就是一件美术品。可惜这些书因为没有做好推广工作，发行的数字远远落后于客观的需要，使这二套画册和画片不能发挥更大的作用。从这一事情中也反映了一个重要的问题，即父母对于子女的教育，虽因大规模地向青年进行共产主义道德品质教育、抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀的宣传教育而引起了人们的重视，但对幼年儿童的教育的重要性还缺乏足够的认识和缺少具体的办法。有的父母（这里主要是指有文化教养的家长），认为幼儿的教育不必管，等他们长大起来再说，宁愿让他们拖着鼻涕在街头巷尾玩肮脏的游戏，或在他们吵闹时塞给几分钱打发开去去买不卫生的零食，而不愿或不懂为孩子们购买些有益的图画故事和画片，进行讲解教育。
    培养具有共产主义高贵道德品质的战士，是需要从幼年时代起就开始的。十分注意对于社会主义新人的萌芽底栽培是未来丰收的可靠的保证。因此把我们的愿望变成实际的行动，把儿童读物的某一方面的特殊落后现象予以消除，是我们的光荣责任。目前已经出版的“幼儿图画故事”和“幼儿画片”数量不多，有些图画还存在一些缺点（如内容不够丰富，少数儿童的形象还太老成，有些成人的形象也嫌粗糙，有些劳动动作显得笨拙等），但这是一个值得我们努力开垦的园地。我们希望少年儿童出版社、儿童读物出版社适当扩大幼儿精神食粮的选题计划，同时期待更多的作者、美术工作者、教师们和家长们关心这个工作，如同我们关心祖国的社会主义建设一样。
