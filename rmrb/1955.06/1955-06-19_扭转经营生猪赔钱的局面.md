Reversing the Situation of Losing Money in Pig Farming
Jiang Guangdong, Manager of China Food Company

    In 1954, after the China Food Company took over the national operation of live pigs, the business developed rapidly. The amount of pork operated in this year was equivalent to four times the amount operated by the Food Export Company in 1953, thus basically ensuring the meat supply in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas, and completing export tasks. There have also been some improvements in business management: the processing capacity of frozen meat has been expanded, and the situation of long-distance transportation of live pigs has been reduced; food companies at all levels have appropriately stored more live pigs, which has played a certain role in overcoming the difficulties of lacking refrigeration equipment, mastering balanced transportation, and organizing normal supply. In terms of transportation, the double-layer pig loading method was promoted, which reduced expenses. In terms of feeding management, the experience of "fattening and gaining weight" of the Changsha First Warehouse was promoted. Advanced working methods and many moving stories have emerged in all links such as purchase, feeding, escort, processing, and supply.
    However, in the past year, the shortcomings and errors in the work were still quite serious. Last year, we not only failed to complete the task of accumulating funds, but also lost a lot of money; the fresh pork supplied to the market generally lost about 5 percent, and some even exceeded 10 percent.
    There are many reasons for losing money. For example, when purchasing live pigs, most areas did not use the amount of meat produced as the standard, but simply priced them based on the size or weight of the pigs. In order to sell more money, farmers tried their best to feed the pigs before selling them. According to surveys in various places, pigs generally lose about 20 pounds after weighing them a few hours after purchase. This is an important reason for losing money. Furthermore, there are still relatively many long-distance transported pigs, so the transportation costs are high; to store live pigs, the storage costs are high. These directly increase operating costs. In terms of prices, the difference in prices in some areas is unreasonable, which is also a reason for losing money.
    However, the most important thing is that too many live pigs get sick and die. According to incomplete statistics in 1954, the number of dead live pigs accounted for more than 1 percent of the total operating volume. In some areas and units, the mortality rate of live pigs was as high as 2 to 3 percent, or even 5 percent. Some units also experienced mass deaths of live pigs. For example, the Tianjin Business Office of the Hunan Provincial Food Company purchased more than 16,200 pigs from October to December 15 last year, and more than 8,800 died or were slaughtered in emergency, accounting for 54 percent of the total purchased. Similar situations exist to varying degrees in almost every province. Most of the pigs that die or are slaughtered in emergency due to illness cannot be used for food. In the slaughterhouses of several large cities, the fatty pigs that need to be processed into oil or discarded after slaughter account for about 3 to 8 percent of the total slaughter volume, which causes alarming losses.
    One of the important reasons for the serious death of live pigs is that the foundation for preventing and controlling livestock diseases in our country is relatively poor. In addition, we underestimated the harm of live pig diseases and did not pay enough attention to sanitary quarantine work. We did not take effective prevention and control measures in technical equipment and organizational leadership, nor did we allocate forces to cooperate with relevant departments in carrying out disease prevention work. Therefore, we often suffer significant losses due to disease.
    Poor feeding management and transportation work are also important reasons for the illness, injury, and death of live pigs. Due to our lack of experience and equipment in large-scale pig farming, and the rapid development of our business, we have certain difficulties in operation. At the same time, large-scale pig farming is most suitable for quick receiving, quick transportation, quick slaughtering, and local slaughtering, and it is not suitable for long-distance transportation. However, our current conditions do not allow us to do this, so we have to appropriately store live pigs and carry out necessary longer-distance live pig transportation. In this case, we have not paid enough attention to feeding management and transportation work. There is a phenomenon of simply pursuing quantity, blindly purchasing, and ignoring storage in operation, and there is also a localist ideology of pushing sick and injured pigs out of our control. The work system in many units is chaotic, and the staff is irresponsible, so the pigs cannot eat well, drink well, or get adequate rest. The places where they live are not clean, and they are even injured or killed by fighting, biting, squeezing, pressing, rain, and sun exposure. There are also cases of loss, running away, and jumping out of vehicles and dying, which have caused serious artificial losses.
    Blind purchases and failure to concentrate transportation according to plan are also causes of live pig deaths. Because the plan is not accurate, the supply of goods is sometimes high and sometimes low. When there is a shortage, the market is out of stock; when there is a surplus, a large amount of goods is concentrated, which makes it impossible for the feeding, storage, and transportation equipment and manpower to cope with, which promotes the development of epidemics and deaths.
    The above situation shows that striving to reduce and avoid the death losses of live pigs is the current urgent task of food companies. In order to do this, food companies at all levels need to strengthen the work in all links such as purchase, feeding, transportation, slaughter, and supply.
    Purchase is the starting point of operation, and in this link, good conditions should be created for the entire commodity circulation process. To this end, it is first necessary to strengthen epidemic inspection work. Before purchasing, it is necessary to conduct thorough inspections, and sick pigs should not be purchased. After purchasing and before transporting out, if sick pigs are found, they should not be transported out. For sick pigs, we must deal with them properly on the spot in a timely manner, depending on the situation, to help farmers. Secondly, before the live pigs are handed over, we must do a good job in feeding, storage, and escort, and strive to maintain the normal diet and mental state of the live pigs. Now some comrades believe that the acquisition station is for immediate receipt and immediate transport, the retention time is very short, and the transportation distance and time are not long. Therefore, the requirements for the quality of work are not strict. They are satisfied with the achievement of buying one head and handing over one head, and never check the condition of the live pigs after they are handed over. Some are even affected by capitalist business ideas. When they are about to hand over, they do not feed and drink according to normal circumstances. If they hand over by number, they deliberately do not feed; if they hand over by weight, they deliberately feed more. There are also those who push sick and weak pigs out of the door regardless. These thoughts and styles must be resolutely corrected.
    Doing a good job in the feeding, storage, and transportation of live pigs is of decisive significance for reducing and avoiding epidemics and deaths. The national food company system has an average total inventory of 700,000 to 800,000 live pigs every day, and more than 1 million at most. Live pigs stay in this stage for the longest time, and this stage is also the stage when live pigs change from dispersed to large-scale concentrated. Due to the different breeds, different personalities, different strengths and weaknesses, and different living habits of pigs, infectious and latent epidemics are prone to occur. Therefore, in addition to preventing sick and weak pigs from entering this link, the most important thing is to ensure that live pigs eat their fill, drink enough, and get good rest. At the same time, we must do a good job in sanitary quarantine. On the basis of ensuring the health and safety of live pigs, we must ensure fat and meat, and strive to create conditions to strive for fat and meat growth. During transportation, except for cooked food and cooked water, which cannot be completely achieved, other feeding management work must not lag behind the breeding farm, and should even be done better. In order to do a good job in transportation, before transportation, it is necessary to find out how many live pigs there are in total, how many are large and how many are small, what are their living habits and health conditions, and to find out whether the road that must be passed to get on and off the ship is wide or narrow, whether it is flat, whether there are congestion or places that hinder walking and damage pig feet, and also to find out the capacity of the transport vehicle, ventilation conditions, whether there are nails or broken thorns in the bamboo and wood, whether it has been cleaned and disinfected; It is also necessary to check whether the windproof, rainproof, fogproof, and sunscreen products, feeding tools, and required feed are complete. In addition, it is also necessary to select transportation vehicles well and continuously improve transportation methods. For example, in the northern Jiangsu area, fixed civilian ships are used to load in bulk in the flat cabin, and the pigs on the ship are not much different from those in the breeding farm, and it is easy to do a good job in escort and feeding. On the contrary, in some areas of Guangdong Province, bamboo cages are used to load pigs, which are stacked layer by layer, which not only makes feeding and drinking difficult, but also hinders the health of live pigs, and the rate of illness and injury is very high. This practice should be changed quickly.
    In order to reduce and avoid the death loss of live pigs, in addition to doing a good job in the above-mentioned links, we must also correctly formulate and master the live pig business plan and strengthen sanitary quarantine work. In order to improve the accuracy of the plan, food companies at all levels should strengthen the investigation and research of production and sales conditions. In addition to mastering general characteristics such as seasonality, they should also pay attention to various factors that may affect the production and market of live pigs (such as the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, agricultural production, feed conditions, disease conditions, and the entire non-staple food production and sales situation, etc.).
    Finally, to improve the management of live pigs, we must also conscientiously implement the purchasing policy of "pricing according to quality and high quality and high price" to encourage farmers to feed fat pigs and develop good varieties. We must strive to save expenses, reduce costs, strengthen the accounting of purchase and sales costs, strive to reduce and avoid unreasonable expenses, and steadily and rationally arrange purchase and sales price differences. In this way, we can reverse the situation of losing money and complete the task of accumulating funds for the country.

    扭转经营生猪赔钱的局面
    中国食品公司经理　蒋光东
      一九五四年，中国食品公司负责全国的生猪经营以后，业务发展得很快。这一年中经营的猪肉数量，相当于一九五三年食品出口公司经营量的四倍，从而基本上保证了大、中城市和工矿地区的肉食供应并完成了出口任务。在经营管理上也有若干改进：扩大了冻肉的加工能力，减少了长途调运活猪的情况；各级食品公司都适当地多储备了一些活猪，对克服缺乏冷藏设备的困难，掌握平衡调运和组织正常供应，都起了一定的作用。在运输方面，推广了双层装猪法，减少了开支。在饲养管理方面，推广了长沙第一仓库“长肉增重”的经验。在收购、饲养、押运、加工、供应等各个环节上，都出现了先进的工作方法和不少动人的事例。
    但是，一年来，工作中的缺点和错误还是相当严重的。去年我们不但没有完成积累资金的任务，反而赔了很多钱；供应市场的鲜猪肉一般的约赔百分之五，有的甚至超过百分之十。
    赔钱的原因很多。例如收购生猪时，大部分地区没有以出肉多少为标准，而是单纯按猪只大小或轻重论价，农民为了多卖钱，便在卖猪以前尽量多给猪喂食。根据各地调查，买进的猪过几小时后再称，一般地都要减重二十斤左右。这是赔钱的一个重要原因。再如，长途调运的猪还比较多，因此运费较大；要储备活猪，保管费用就多。这些都直接增高了经营成本。在价格方面，有一部分地区差价规定得不合理，也是赔钱的原因之一。
    但是，最重要的还是生猪生病和死亡得太多。根据一九五四年的不完全统计，死亡的生猪要占全部经营量的百分之一以上。有些地区和单位，生猪的死亡率高达百分之二、三，甚至百分之五。有些单位还发生了生猪成批死亡的事件。如湖南省食品公司天津市经营处，去年十月至十二月十五日，共收购一万六千二百多头猪，死亡和急宰的就有八千八百多头，占购进总数的百分之五十四。类似情况几乎每省都程度不同地存在。猪只死亡或因病急宰后，大部都不能再供食用。在几个大城市的屠宰场里，宰后需要加工熬油或废弃的肥猪约占全部屠宰量的百分之三到百分之八，造成的损失是惊人的。
    生猪死亡严重的原因之一，是目前我国在防治牲畜病疫方面基础较差，再加上我们对生猪病疫的危害性估计不足，对卫生检疫工作重视不够，在技术设备和组织领导上没有采取有效的防治措施，也没有配备力量来配合有关部门开展防治病疫工作，因此常常因病疫关系，遭受重大的损失。
    饲养管理和运输工作做得不好，也是生猪病伤和死亡的重要原因。由于我们缺乏大规模经营生猪的经验和设备，业务发展得又快，在经营上有一定的困难。同时，大量经营生猪，最适于快收，快运，快宰和就地屠宰，不宜长途调运。但是我们目前的条件不能够这样做，不得不适当地储备活猪和进行必要的较长途的活猪运输。在这种情况下，我们又对饲养管理和运输工作重视不够，经营时有单纯追求数量、盲目收购、忽视保管的现象，也有把病伤猪推出不管的本位主义思想。许多单位的工作制度混乱，工作人员不负责任，使猪吃不好食，喝不好水，得不到适当休息，住的地方也不干净，甚至因为互相打、咬、挤、压和受雨淋日晒而致伤致死，也有丢失跑掉和跳车死亡的，这些都造成了严重的人为的损失。
    盲目收购和不按照计划集中调运，也是造成生猪死亡的原因之一。因为计划不准确，所以货源时多时少。少的时候，市场脱销；多的时候就大量集中，使饲养、保管和运输的设备、人力都无法应付，助长了疫病和死亡现象的发展。
    上述情况说明，努力减少和避免生猪的死亡损失，是食品公司当前的迫切任务。为了做到这一点，各级食品公司需要加强收购、饲养、运输、屠宰和供应等各个环节的工作。
    收购是经营的起点，在这一环节中，应该给整个商品流转过程创造良好的条件。为此，首先要加强疫病检查工作。在收购前，要切实检验，发现病猪就不收购。购进以后运出以前，如果发现病猪，就不向外运。对于病猪，要分别情况，及时帮助农民就地妥善处理。其次，在生猪交出以前，要做好饲养保管和押运工作，要努力保持生猪的饮食和精神状况正常。现在有些同志认为收购站是随收随运，存留时间很短，运输路途和时间不长，因而对工作质量的要求不严格，满足于买进一头交出一头的成绩，从不检查交出以后的生猪状况，有的甚至受资本主义经营思想的影响，快要交接的时候就不按正常情况喂饮，如果按头数交接，就故意不喂，按斤重交接，就故意多喂，也有把病猪弱猪推出门不管的。这些思想作风都必须坚决纠正。
    做好生猪的饲养保管和运输工作，对减少和避免疫病、死亡有决定的意义。全国食品公司系统，每天库存的活猪平均总有七八十万头，多的时候要在一百万头以上。生猪停留在这一阶段的时间最长，同时这一阶段又是生猪由分散转入大量集中的阶段。由于猪的品种不同、性格不同、强弱不一，生活习惯各异，传染性和潜伏性的疫病很容易发生。因此，除了防止病猪弱猪流入这一环节外，最重要的是使生猪吃饱、饮足、休息好，同时要做好卫生检疫工作。要在保证生猪健康、安全的基础上，做到保膘保肉，并努力创造条件争取长膘长肉。在运输途中，除了熟食熟水等不可能完全做到外，其他饲养管理工作都必须不落后于饲养场，甚至应该做得更好些。为了做好运输工作，在运输之前，必须要弄清楚生猪一共有多少，大小各有多少，生活习惯和健康状况如何，要弄清上下车船必经的路途是宽是窄，是否平整，有无拥塞或妨碍行走损伤猪脚的地方，还要弄清运输工具的容量、通风情况、里面有没有钉子、竹木的破刺，是否已经打扫干净和消过毒；还要检查防风、防雨、防雾、防晒用品，饲养工具及所需饲料是否齐备。此外，还要很好地选择运输工具，不断改进运输方法。像江苏北部一带用固定民船平舱散装，猪在船上和在饲养场没有多大差别，容易做好押运饲养工作。相反的，广东省有些地区，使用竹笼装猪，层层堆垛，不仅喂饮困难，也妨害生猪健康，病伤率很高，这种做法应该迅速改变。
    为了减少和避免生猪的死亡损失，除了做好上述各个环节的工作外，还必须正确地制定和掌握生猪经营计划，加强卫生检疫工作。为了提高计划的准确程度，各级食品公司都应该加强对产销情况的调查研究，除了掌握季节性等一般特点外，还要注意可能影响生猪生产和上市情况的种种因素（如互助合作运动情况、农业生产情况、饲料情况、病疫情况、整个副食品产销情况等。）
    最后，要改善生猪的经营管理，还必须认真执行“依质论价、优质优价”的收购政策，以鼓励农民喂肥猪和发展优良品种。必须努力节约开支，减少费用，加强购销成本的核算，努力减少和避免不合理开支，并稳步地合理安排购销差价。这样，我们就可以扭转赔钱的局面，完成给国家积累资金的任务。
