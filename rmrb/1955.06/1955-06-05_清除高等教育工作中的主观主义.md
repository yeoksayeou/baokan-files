    Eliminate Subjectivism in Higher Education Work
    Ji Xiao
    In recent years, two major problems have occurred in universities and colleges: one is the implementation of the so-called six-hour consecutive "system," and the other is the excessive academic burden on students. These two things have brought considerable losses to higher education. Currently, the Ministry of Higher Education is vigorously correcting this, which is a timely measure.
    Those who advocate the six-hour consecutive "system" have listed many advantages of "concentrating classes in the morning." They say: "The mind is clear in the morning, and learning efficiency is high"; "Concentrating classes in the morning allows afternoons to be freed up for collective activities and physical exercise"; "Concentrated classes and concentrated self-study can avoid wasting time due to empty periods," and so on. Of course, these opinions cannot be said to be entirely wrong. However, the result is that attending classes for as long as six hours from 7:00 AM to 1:00 PM inevitably reduces learning efficiency and affects the physical and mental strength of teachers and students; eating breakfast at 6:30 AM and not having the second meal until after 1:00 PM inevitably harms the stomach and affects health; equally important, libraries, sports fields, and other places are idle in the morning, while classrooms and laboratories are idle in the afternoon, which inevitably reduces the utilization rate of buildings and teaching equipment, violating the policy of practicing strict economy.
    The problem of excessive burden on university students is an old one. In recent years, the situation has been: due to the one-sided demand of the leadership of higher education work for both speed and quality, courses have had to be offered as many as nine, ten, or even eleven per semester, the most advanced translations have had to be adopted as teaching materials, examinations and tests have been given as many as ten or more times in a semester, and homework and other extracurricular assignments have far exceeded the amount that students can complete in self-study time... As a result, very few students participate in recreational activities, Sundays are called "seventh days of the week," and some students stay up all night "burning the midnight oil" whenever they encounter examinations and tests, resulting in a decline in students' health, an increase in the percentage of insomnia, neurasthenia, and gastrointestinal diseases, a surge in the number of students taking leave of absence or dropping out, while academic performance is not good. Not only is the knowledge learned at ordinary times not digested and consolidated, but the percentage of failures in examinations and tests is also high (some as high as one-third of subjects failing), and at the same time, students generally do not pay attention to the study of current affairs and politics. Needless to say, this is contrary to the educational policy of all-round development. The result will inevitably seriously damage the cause of training qualified industrial construction talents for the country.
    Although these two things are different in form, they are exactly the same in nature. That is to say, both of these things show the contradiction between motive and effect. Namely: the motives are all good, but the effects are all bad. We are Marxists-Leninists. According to the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint, "the motive for the masses and the effect welcomed by the masses are inseparable and must be unified." (Mao Zedong: "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") Therefore, no matter how well-intentioned the leadership of higher education work is, their mistakes in handling matters are unforgivable.
    Why does this phenomenon of contradiction between motive and effect occur? This is mainly because the leadership of higher education work proceeds only from subjective wishes, without regard to the actual situation. Take the implementation of the so-called six-hour consecutive "system" as an example, they only see the minor aspect and do not look at the major aspect, such as the physical strength of students and the utilization rate of teaching equipment. They stubbornly adhere to their subjective opinions to an astonishing degree. After many schools implemented the so-called six-hour consecutive "system," teachers and students raised objections, but the leadership still ignored them. As for the problem of excessive burden on students, the leadership of higher education work insistently demands both speed and quality, but they do not look at the current objective and specific conditions of universities and colleges. First of all, the quality of university students is relatively poor. Because there are not enough high school graduates for the number of university admissions, the quality of many of those who enter university is certainly not high; worker-peasant cadres who enter university generally have higher political quality, but their cultural level is generally lower than that of high school graduates. Secondly, there is a serious shortage of teachers in universities and colleges. Most of the teachers are teaching assistants, and the number of teaching assistants exceeds 50% of the total number of teachers, and in individual departments (such as engineering), it exceeds 60%, and about 40% of these teaching assistants are graduates of two-year vocational colleges and undergraduates who graduated three years ahead of schedule, and many teaching assistants have to reluctantly teach courses. In addition, such as the teaching plans and syllabuses of universities and colleges, not only have they not all been drawn up yet, but many of those that have been drawn up have requirements that are too high; teaching materials are extremely scarce, and only a few courses have formal textbooks, and the rest are selected and adopted by teachers. However, the leadership of higher education work turn a blind eye to these objective and specific conditions.
    The leadership of higher education work does not consider the objective situation beforehand, nor does it humbly listen to the opinions of the masses afterward. As a result, the motive and effect are contradictory, and the cause of training talents for national construction is harmed. It is quite obvious that this is a prominent manifestation of being divorced from reality and divorced from the masses.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that in dealing with any problem, we must proceed from reality. If those who do practical work do not pay attention to the study of objective conditions and handle affairs solely on the basis of subjective enthusiasm, then they are committing the mistake of subjectivism. Therefore, strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism, establishing a dialectical materialist worldview, and eliminating subjectivism in practical work should be an important task for higher education workers at present.

### 清除高等教育工作中的主观主义

    清除高等教育工作中的主观主义
    季晓
    近年来，高等学校中发生了两个较大的问题：一个是施行所谓六时（节）一贯“制”，另一个是学生学习负担过重。这两件事给高等教育工作带来不小的损失。目前，高等教育部正在大力纠正，这是及时的措施。
    主张六时一贯“制”者列举了许多“集中上午上课”的优点。他们说：“上午脑子清爽，学习效率高”；“集中上午上课，下午可以腾出来做集体活动和体育锻炼”；“集中上课，集中自修，可以免去因空堂而浪费时间”，等等。当然，这些意见不能说是全都错了。但是其结果，从上午七时到下午一时上课六小时之久，这就必然降低了学习的效率，并且影响了师生的体力和脑力；从早晨六时半吃早饭，到下午一时后才吃第二餐，这就必然有害肠胃，影响健康；同样重要的是，上午空闲了图书馆和运动场等场所，而下午则空闲了教室和实验室，这就必然降低了房屋和教学设备的使用率，违背了厉行节约的政策。
    高等学校学生负担过重的问题是个老问题。近年来发生的情况是：由于高等教育工作的领导方面片面地提出既要快又要好的要求，于是课程每学期不得不开九门十门乃至十一门之多，教材不得不采取最高深的译本，考查考试在一个学期中有多达十几次的，留习题和其他课外作业远远超过学生在自学时间内所能完成的数量……。其结果，文娱活动很少有学生参加，星期日被叫做“星期七”，有的学生一遇到考查考试就整夜“开夜车”，以致学生健康状况下降，失眠、神经衰弱和患胃肠病的百分率增长，休学退学人数激增，而学习成绩并不好。不但平时学得的东西不能消化和巩固，考查考试不及格的百分率也高（有高到三分之一学科不及格的），同时，学生普遍不注意时事和政治的学习。不消说，这是同全面发展的教育方针相违背的。结果必将使为国家培养合格的工业建设人才的事业遭受严重损失。
    虽然这两件事在形式上不同，但是它们在性质上完全一样。这就是说，这两件事都表现了动机同效果的矛盾。即：其动机都是好的，而其效果则都是坏的。我们是马克思列宁主义者，按照马克思列宁主义的观点，“为大众的动机和被大众欢迎的效果，是分不开的，必须使二者统一起来。”（毛泽东：“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）因此，不管高等教育工作的领导上如何好心，但是他们把事情办坏了，这就是不可饶恕的错误。
    为什么会发生这种动机同效果矛盾的现象呢？这主要是因为高等教育工作的领导方面仅从主观愿望出发，而不顾及实际的情况。以施行所谓六时一贯“制”来说吧，他们只看到次要的一面，而不来看看主要的一面，如学生的体力和教学设备的利用率。他们固执自己的主观意见甚至达到惊人的程度。不少学校在施行所谓六时一贯“制”后，师生都提出反对，但是领导方面仍然不予理睬。以学生负担过重的问题来说吧，高等教育工作的领导方面一味要求既要快、又要好，但是他们根本不来看看目前高等学校的一些客观具体条件。首先，高等学校学生的质量较差。由于高中毕业生不够高等学校招生数，所以很多升入大学的，其质量当然不会高；工农干部升入大学的，政治质量一般较高，而文化程度一般则较高中毕业生低。其次，高等学校的师资严重缺乏。教师中多半是助教，助教人数超过教师总人数百分之五十，个别科系超过百分之六十（如工科），而且其中约有百分之四十的助教是二年专科毕业生和三年提前毕业的本科生，不少助教也都不得不勉强开课。此外，如高等学校教学计划教学大纲，不但还没有全部订出来，订出来的很多也是要求偏高；教材更是极端缺乏，只有很少几门课有正式课本，其余都是凭教师们选择采用。但是，高等教育工作的领导方面对于这些客观具体条件竟然视而不见。
    高等教育工作的领导方面事前既不顾及客观情况，事后又不虚心听取群众意见。于是，动机同效果发生矛盾了，国家培养建设人材的事业受到了损害。十分显然，这正是脱离实际，脱离群众的突出表现。
    马克思列宁主义教导我们，处理任何问题，要从实际出发。如果做实际工作的人不注意客观情况的研究，单凭主观热情来办事，那么，他们就是犯了主观主义的毛病。因此，加强马克思列宁主义的学习，树立辩证唯物主义的世界观，肃清实际工作中的主观主义，这应该是高等教育工作者当前的重要任务。
