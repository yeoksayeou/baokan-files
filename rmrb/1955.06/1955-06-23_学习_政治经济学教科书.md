    Studying the "Textbook of Political Economy"
    Zhang Zhongshi
    The "Textbook of Political Economy," compiled by the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, was collectively written by many well-known economists under the care of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In the process of compilation, it also received active assistance from many economists. In November 1951, the CPSU Central Committee specifically organized an economic discussion meeting to examine the content of the textbook, with hundreds of economists and social science workers participating. The discussion made a comprehensive and critical analysis of the unfinished manuscript of the textbook and put forward many opinions and suggestions. Stalin's famous book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" summarized this discussion and gave principled instructions on some important issues. This made the content of the textbook more substantial and the structure more perfect.
    Starting from the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, and based on the experience of the world proletarian revolutionary struggle, especially the practical experience of the Soviet people in building a socialist society and the people's democratic countries in carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation, the textbook systematically expounds all the basic problems of political economy. The textbook not only provides concise summaries of the important principles in the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, but also provides theoretical answers to some new questions raised by the current stage of the Soviet people's construction of communism, the people of various people's democratic countries in building socialism, and the practice of the masses of people in various countries in striving for socialism. The textbook has made many theoretical and methodological problems of Marxist-Leninist political economy clearer. The spirit of the important decisions of the 19th Congress of the CPSU and the subsequent decisions of the CPSU Central Committee on the development of agriculture, the development of heavy industry and the production of consumer goods for the people, as well as the resolutions of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various people's democratic countries on socialist construction and transformation, are also reflected in the textbook. In these senses, the publication of this textbook marks a new stage in the development of Marxist-Leninist economics.
    Therefore, compared with all old political economy textbooks, this textbook has many advantages in terms of content and writing style.
    Old textbooks generally only discuss the economic forms of capitalist society, and rarely discuss other social and economic forms, especially the economic forms of socialist society. This textbook systematically discusses the regular alternation of the five social and economic forms in history—primitive commune system, slave-owning system, feudalism, capitalism, socialism—and the laws of material production and distribution in each social and economic form; it first expressed the basic economic laws of the three pre-capitalist modes of production—primitive commune system, slave-owning system, and feudalism, thereby showing the regularity of human society's development from simple to advanced forms, from lower to higher levels. Engels once pointed out that it is necessary to study the laws of material production and distribution at all stages of development of human society. This textbook establishes such a system of political economy.
    Old textbooks generally rarely describe modern capitalism. This textbook comprehensively clarifies some important issues of modern capitalism, such as the basic economic law of modern capitalism, the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism after World War II and the intensification of capitalist imbalances, the formation of two camps and the disintegration of the unified world market, imperialism's expansion and war preparations policies, and the impoverishment of the working class and peasants in capitalist countries.
    When elucidating socialist economic issues, old textbooks generally did not discuss objective economic laws, but explained the economic policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state. This textbook systematically and comprehensively demonstrates all economic issues of socialism for the first time, discusses the regularity and characteristics of the formation and development of the socialist mode of production, discusses the various economic categories of socialist society, and discusses the emergence of the world democratic market and the nature of economic relations and basic forms of economic cooperation between socialist camp countries, thereby establishing a complete socialist political economy.
    Old textbooks generally only discussed the economic base of capitalist society, and rarely talked about the superstructure that corresponds to it. This textbook not only clarifies the economic base of each social and economic form, but also briefly describes their superstructures, and the economic views of each historical era. This allows readers to compare and study Marxist-Leninist political economy with various economic views, and allows readers to deal with scientific principles historically rather than dogmatically. For example, the description of economic theories in the capitalist era at the end of the second part. Here, the history of bourgeois political economy is briefly described, the revolution of Marx and Engels in political economy is discussed, modern bourgeois political economy and the economic theories of the Second International opportunists and modern right-wing social democrats are criticized, and Lenin's development of Marxist capitalist political economy and Stalin's elucidation of a series of new principles of capitalist political economy are explained.
    Old textbooks generally rarely mentioned the colonial issue. This textbook has a special chapter expounding the colonial system of imperialism and the national liberation struggles of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries. The textbook clarifies the role of colonies in the imperialist era, the methods of imperialist exploitation of colonial people, and other issues, pointing out that the characteristic of the imperialist colonial system is the intertwining of capitalist exploitation and plunder with various remnants of feudal oppression and even slave oppression; one of the most important conditions for the survival of modern capitalism is the unlimited exploitation of colonies and semi-colonies. The textbook also discusses the development of the national liberation struggles of colonial people and the new characteristics of the national liberation movement at this stage—the strengthening of the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party in most colonial countries.
    In these respects, this textbook is the most substantial and structurally perfect of all political economy textbooks, and is the highest achievement of Marxist-Leninist political economy at the present stage.
    Political economy is a very important component of Marxist-Leninist theory. It studies the economic laws of social development, and the laws of production and distribution of material means of life at all stages of development of human society. It proves that it is possible to recognize the objective laws of economic development and use these laws to benefit society. It is the theoretical basis of all economic policies of the proletarian party. Therefore, Marxist-Leninist political economy is the most sharp ideological weapon for the proletariat and the working people to oppose capitalism and all oppression, and to strive for the victory of socialism, and it is the most important theoretical weapon for the proletariat to fight against the bourgeois ideological system. Its great power lies in its ability to enable the working class to understand the laws of social and economic development, determine the direction, understand the future, and enhance confidence in the victory of socialism and communism; it lies in its ability to enable the proletarian party to build its policies on a scientific basis.
    Obviously, the publication of this "Textbook of Political Economy" has enormous international significance. Not only do the Soviet people need it, but the working class and working people of all countries in the world also need it very much. It can arm the working class and working people of various capitalist countries with the laws of social and economic development and the rich knowledge of the Soviet Union's construction of socialism, so that they can fight to break free from the chains of capitalism and strive for socialism and peace. It also has great guiding significance for the people of various people's democratic countries, enabling them to use the Soviet experience to strive for the construction of socialism with more confidence. Three years ago, Stalin said that the political economy textbook would be a good gift for young communists in all countries of the world, and it would also be of great benefit to non-young communist cadres.
    The great historical task facing our country is to build our motherland into a prosperous, strong and happy socialist country. But we have many difficulties. The legacy we inherited from the old society is very pitiful, and our economy and culture are very backward. At the present stage, in our national economy, in addition to the socialist state-owned economy and cooperative economy, there are also a large number of capitalist components and individual economies. We are also surrounded by imperialism. In order to overcome all kinds of difficulties and smoothly complete this historical task, our staff should understand economic knowledge, especially knowledge about the socialist economy, and be familiar with specific economic problems and practical methods of leading the economy. Because with knowledge of economic laws, we can deeply understand the essence of the economic process, discover progressive development trends that are still in their infancy, and scientifically predict the process of economic development, so as to successfully complete the task of socialist construction. Therefore, studying this textbook seriously will greatly improve the political and ideological level and the level of economic leadership of our staff.
          × × ×
    The textbook is divided into three parts, namely: 1. The mode of production before capitalism, which discusses the production relations and economic development laws of the three social and economic forms of primitive commune system, slave-owning system, and feudalism; 2. The capitalist mode of production, which discusses the laws of the emergence, development, and demise of the capitalist social and economic form; 3. The socialist mode of production, which discusses the process of the emergence and development of the socialist social and economic form and how to transition to a communist society. In addition, there is an introduction at the beginning of the book, which expounds the object and method of political economy; at the end of the book, there is a concluding remark, which talks about the path that Marxist-Leninist political economy has experienced for more than a hundred years and what it has taught us.
    Among these three parts, the one on the socialist mode of production has special guiding significance for our current socialist construction and socialist transformation, not only in theory but also in practice.
    At present, our country is in the transition period from new democracy to socialism. The general line of our party in the transition period is to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization, and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and build our motherland into a great, prosperous and strong socialist country. The first part of this chapter comprehensively expounds some important issues in the transition period from capitalism to socialism. It comprehensively and systematically expounds the basic characteristics of the transition period from capitalism to socialism; expounds some issues of socialist industrialization, such as the significance, essence, speed, methods, and sources of funds of socialist industrialization; expounds some issues of agricultural collectivization, such as the inevitability of agricultural collectivization, the prerequisites for complete collectivization, complete collectivization and the elimination of the rich peasant class, and the basic form of collective farms—agricultural labor cooperatives; and expounds the various achievements of the Soviet Union in building socialism, such as the establishment of the socialist mode of production, the changes in the social class structure, and the elimination of economic inequality among ethnic groups.
    What is particularly noteworthy in this part is the discussion on the characteristics of class struggle in the transition period, the leading role of the working class in socialist construction and the necessity of the worker-peasant alliance, and the gradual restriction of the role of the law of value by the Soviet regime in the transition period in accordance with the law of planned development of the national economy.
    The textbook points out that the basic contradiction in the transition period is the contradiction between socialism and capitalism. In all fields of economic life in the transition period, the struggle between socialism and capitalism is carried out according to the principle of "who will win." On the one hand, there are the working class and the basic masses of peasants, and on the other hand, there is the bourgeoisie. There are antagonistic and irreconcilable contradictions between them. For the transition period, the intensification of the class struggle of the working class and the working masses against the bourgeoisie is in line with the law, because the bourgeoisie's resistance is becoming increasingly fierce with the unfolding of socialist construction.
    The textbook points out that in the transition period, each country has the following basic economic components: socialism, small commodity production, and capitalism. The corresponding classes are: the working class, the petty bourgeoisie (especially the peasants), and the bourgeoisie. Among them, the working class has changed from an oppressed class under the capitalist system to a ruling class, holding political power and controlling all the means of production that have been nationalized, and therefore it is the leading force of the country. The peasants, that is, the poor and middle peasants, have received land from the ruling working class, freed themselves from the shackles of the landlords and the exploitation of the rich peasants, and have received comprehensive economic and cultural assistance. The peasant is dualistic in nature: as a private owner, he tends to capitalism; as a laborer, he tends to socialism. Although in the transition period, especially when the peasants are still private owners, there are some contradictions between the working class and the masses of peasants on certain issues, such as price issues, these contradictions are not antagonistic and not fundamental. On fundamental issues, the interests of the two classes are completely consistent, and both have a vital stake in eliminating exploitation and building socialism. Therefore, the working class and the masses of peasants can form a solid alliance, with the working class as the leader. This alliance is the foundation of socialist construction, a necessary condition for establishing correct economic relations between cities and countryside, industry and agriculture, and a necessary condition for agricultural upsurge and its socialist transformation. Only a solid worker-peasant alliance can guarantee the elimination of capitalist economic components and the complete victory of socialism.
    The textbook points out that during the transition period, the Soviet government took a series of measures to gradually limit the scope of the law of value in accordance with the laws of planned economic development. At that time, the Soviet regime implemented direct planning within the scope of the state-owned economy, stipulating production tasks to each enterprise, and began to stipulate fixed prices for commodities produced by state-owned enterprises. However, it was impossible to implement such planning in the peasant economy based on private ownership and small commodity production. What to do? The state uses indirect economic adjustment methods, that is, to influence the peasant economy through commerce, supply, purchase, prices, credit, and finance. The Soviet state used these tools to consolidate its connection with the peasant economy and strengthen the leading role of the socialist economic component. At that time, the role of the law of value in the private market was manifested as: prices formed spontaneously, there was competition and speculation, and capitalist elements could make a fortune at the expense of laborers. In order to fight stubbornly against capitalist elements, the Soviet state concentrated more and more large quantities of commodities in its own hands, expanded the purchase of agricultural products more and more widely, and at the same time, began to basically stipulate the prices of grain and other important commodities, and used all means to limit free speculation on market prices.
    Studying this part will enable us to more deeply understand the theoretical basis of our party's general line and various economic policies in the transition period, and improve the policy level in our work.
    At present, in our national economy, the socialist component has played a leading role, and its proportion in the national economy is constantly increasing. Therefore, a major task facing us is how to lead socialist construction and socialist transformation in accordance with the economic laws of socialism, and achieve success. The second part of this chapter uses a huge amount of space (Chapters 26 to 39) to discuss the socialist economic system and its development laws. Here, what we should pay special attention to is the discussion on the various economic laws of socialism and how to carry out socialist construction smoothly in accordance with these laws. The textbook points out that with the emergence and development of socialist production relations, under new economic conditions, some new economic laws, such as the basic economic law of socialism, the law of planned (proportionate) development of the national economy, the law of continuous improvement of labor productivity, and the law of distribution according to work, have emerged and begun to play a role. What these economic laws express is the relationship of comradely cooperation and mutual assistance between workers who are not exploited. The role of these economic laws makes the socialist economic component increasingly developed and the people's welfare increasingly improved. These socialist economic laws, like the economic laws of other modes of production, have an objective nature. Their emergence and role are independent of people's will and cannot be arbitrarily created, formulated, transformed, or abolished. If these laws are ignored or denied, and things are not done in accordance with these laws, it is bound to produce bad results, cause chaos in economic life, and cause political adventurism and arbitrary actions in economic leadership. However, in socialist society, people can recognize these laws, master them, and use them to benefit society. The more fully people understand these laws, the more accurately they reflect the requirements of these laws in their practical activities, the more smoothly they can achieve their goals. This part has special chapters to discuss the nature, characteristics, and role of these laws.
    This part provides scientific explanations on commodity production, the law of value, currency, wages, economic accounting, commerce, national income, state budget, credit, currency circulation, and socialist reproduction under the socialist system. In addition, there is also a special chapter detailing the problem of socialist agriculture. Here, what is particularly noteworthy is the scientific discussion of the system of economy. The economy system is a socialist management method, the purpose of which is to achieve the best results with the least consumption. The way to save money is to cherish public property, constantly reduce the living labor and materialized labor consumed in product production, improve technology, and rationally utilize human, material and financial resources. Abiding by the system of economy is a necessary condition for increasing socialist accumulation and correctly using the accumulated funds, and it is a powerful lever for developing socialist production. Therefore, it is a basic task of the economic organization activities of socialist countries to vigorously practice economy in all links and all management departments of the national economy.
    This part also scientifically clarifies the leading and guiding role of the Communist Party and the socialist state in developing the socialist economy. In particular, the party is the leading core of the socialist country. Based on its understanding of economic laws, it guides the activities of all state organs and labor people's social organizations.
    Studying this part of the textbook will enable us to better understand the knowledge of economic laws and improve the level of economic leadership work.
    At present, our country's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries is developing rapidly. What is the nature of this cooperation? What is its significance for our country's socialist construction and the cause of defending world peace? These questions are worth studying. In addition to discussing the socialist construction of various people's democratic countries and the economic system of our People's Republic of China, the third part of this textbook also provides a profound theoretical explanation of the nature of economic cooperation between countries in the socialist camp. After World War II, with the departure of many countries in Europe and Asia from the capitalist system and the disintegration of the unified world market, these people's democratic countries formed a socialist camp with the Soviet Union, establishing close economic cooperation with each other, and formed a new world democratic market parallel to the world capitalist market. At present, there are twelve countries participating in this market, accounting for a quarter of the land area on the earth and possessing more than one-third of the world's population. This market has extremely rich resources, and each country can find everything necessary for the development of its own economy within the scope of this market. The economic relations and economic cooperation between the countries participating in this market are increasingly developing and expanding with the growth of their economic construction. The main forms of this economic cooperation are foreign trade, loans, scientific and technological assistance, and cooperation in training cadres.
    Although the countries in the socialist camp differ in their level of economic and technological development, the socialist economic form occupies a leading position in their economies. Therefore, the economic relations between them have the following characteristics: (1) The economic cooperation between them is based on the economic laws of socialism and reflects the requirements of these laws, so it is a new type of international relations that has never existed in history. (2) The economic cooperation between them is in line with the basic economic law of socialism and is subject to a common goal, that is, to most fully meet the ever-growing needs of the working people by continuously increasing and improving socialist production on a highly technical basis. Therefore, in the socialist camp, the mutual relations between countries are comradely cooperation and mutual assistance, in which there is no and cannot be economic expansion, unequal exchange, competition, or exploitation and enslavement of weak countries by strong countries. (3) The economic cooperation between them is planned. In line with the law of planned (proportionate) development of the national economy, the national plans of the countries in the socialist camp to develop the national economy take into account the plans for economic cooperation with each other. This ensures that countries in the socialist camp can properly use existing resources to rapidly develop productive forces, continuously prosper the economy, and improve the welfare of the people.
    Studying this part of the textbook will enable our staff to more deeply understand the theoretical basis for our current friendship and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries.

    学习“政治经济学教科书”
    张仲实
    苏联科学院经济研究所编纂的“政治经济学教科书”是在苏联共产党中央的关怀下，由许多著名的经济学家集体写成的。在编写过程中，还得到了许多经济学家的积极协助。一九五一年十一月间，苏共中央为了审定教科书的内容，还专门组织了一次经济讨论会，参加的有几百个经济学家和社会科学工作者。讨论会对教科书未定稿又作了全面的批判的分析，并提出了许多意见和建议。斯大林的名著“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书，就是总结这次讨论会的，并对一些重要问题作了原则的指示。这就使教科书的内容更加充实，结构更加完善。
    教科书从马克思列宁主义的基本原理出发，并根据世界无产阶级革命斗争的经验，特别是苏联人民建成社会主义社会和各人民民主国家进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的实际经验，有系统地阐述了政治经济学的一切基本问题。教科书不仅对马克思列宁主义经典著作中的重要原理作了简明扼要的概括，而且对于现阶段苏联人民建设共产主义、各人民民主国家人民建设社会主义以及各国人民群众争取社会主义的实践所提出的一些新问题都从理论上给了答复。教科书使马克思列宁主义政治经济学的许多理论问题和方法论问题更加明确了。苏共第十九次代表大会和以后苏共中央关于发展农业、关于发展重工业和人民消费品生产的一些重要决定的精神及各人民民主国家共产党和工人党关于社会主义建设和改造的一些决议的精神，在教科书中也都有了反映。从这些意义说来，这本教科书的出版标志了马克思列宁主义经济学发展的一个新阶段。
    因此，这本教科书同一切旧的政治经济学教科书比较，不论在内容上或写法上，都有许多优点。
    旧教科书一般只论述资本主义社会经济形态，对于其他社会经济形态，尤其是对于社会主义社会经济形态，很少加以论述。这本教科书系统地论述了历史上五种社会经济形态——原始公社制度、奴隶占有制度、封建主义、资本主义、社会主义——的有规律的更替和每个社会经济形态中物质资料生产和分配的规律；它首次表述了资本主义以前三种生产方式——原始公社制、奴隶占有制、封建主义的基本经济规律，从而表明了人类社会从简单形式到高级形式，从低级到高级发展的规律性。恩格斯曾经指出，必须研究人类社会各个发展阶段上物质资料生产和分配的规律。这本教科书正建立了这样政治经济学体系。
    旧教科书对于现代资本主义一般很少加以叙述。这本教科书全面地阐明了现代资本主义的一些重要问题，例如，现代资本主义的基本经济规律、第二次世界大战后资本主义总危机的加深和资本主义不平衡性的加剧、两个阵营的形成和统一的世界市场的瓦解、帝国主义的扩张和备战政策、资本主义国家工人阶级和农民的赤贫化等等。
    旧教科书在阐明社会主义经济问题时，一般不是论述客观经济规律，而是说明苏联共产党和苏维埃国家的经济政策。这本教科书首次系统地全面地论证了社会主义的一切经济问题，论述了社会主义生产方式形成和发展的规律性及其特点，论述了社会主义社会的各种经济范畴，并论述了世界民主市场的产生和社会主义阵营各国间经济关系的性质和经济合作的基本形式，从而建立了完整的社会主义政治经济学。
    旧教科书一般只限于论述资本主义社会的经济基础，很少讲到同其相适应的上层建筑。这本教科书不仅阐明了每个社会经济形态的经济基础，而且简要地叙述了它们的上层建筑，叙述了每个历史时代的经济观点。这就使读者可以把马克思列宁主义政治经济学同各种经济观点加以对比和研究，并使读者可以历史地而非教条地来处理科学原理。例如第二篇末尾对资本主义时代经济学说的叙述。在这里简单扼要地描述了资产阶级政治经济学的历史，论述了马克思和恩格斯在政治经济学中的革命，批判了现代资产阶级政治经济学和第二国际机会主义者和现代右翼社会党人的经济理论，并说明了列宁对马克思主义的资本主义政治经济学的发展和斯大林对资本主义政治经济学一系列新原理的阐明。
    旧教科书一般很少讲到殖民地问题。这本教科书有专章阐述了帝国主义的殖民体系和殖民地半殖民地国家人民的民族解放斗争。教科书阐明了殖民地在帝国主义时期的作用、帝国主义对殖民地人民的剥削方法等问题，指出帝国主义的殖民体系的特征就是资本主义的剥削和掠夺同封建压迫甚至奴隶制压迫的各种残余交织在一起；现代资本主义最重要的生存条件之一便是对殖民地和半殖民地的无限制的剥削。教科书并论述了殖民地人民的民族解放斗争的发展、及现阶段民族解放运动的新特点——在大多数殖民地国家里无产阶级和共产党领导作用的加强等问题。
    从这些方面说来，这本教科书是所有政治经济学教科书中内容最充实结构最完善的一本，是马克思列宁主义政治经济学在现阶段的最高成果。
    政治经济学是马克思列宁主义理论的一个极重要的组成部分。它研究社会发展的经济规律，研究人类社会各个发展阶段上物质生活资料生产和分配的规律。它证明认识经济发展客观规律及利用这些规律来为社会谋利益是可能的。它是无产阶级政党一切经济政策的理论基础。因此，马克思列宁主义政治经济学是无产阶级和劳动人民反对资本主义和一切压迫、争取社会主义胜利的最锐利的思想武器，是无产阶级同资产阶级思想体系作斗争的最重要的理论武器。它的伟大的力量就在于它能使工人阶级懂得社会经济发展的规律，确定方向，明了前途，提高对社会主义和共产主义胜利的信心；就在于它能使无产阶级政党把自己的政策建筑在科学基础上。
    显然，这本“政治经济学教科书”的出版有着巨大的国际意义。不仅苏联人民需要它，世界各国工人阶级和劳动人民也都十分需要它。它能用社会经济发展规律和苏联建成社会主义的丰富知识把各个资本主义国家的工人阶级和劳动人民武装起来，使他们为挣脱资本主义锁链、争取社会主义和和平而斗争。它对于各人民民主国家的人民也有巨大的指导意义，它能使他们利用苏联的经验更有信心地为建成社会主义而努力。三年前，斯大林曾说，政治经济学教科书将是给予世界各国年青共产党人的良好礼物，也会给予非年青的共产党员干部以很大的好处。
    我国面临的伟大的历史任务，就是把我们的祖国建设成为一个富强、繁荣、幸福的社会主义国家。但是我们的困难很多，我们从旧社会继承下来的遗产十分可怜，我们的经济文化十分落后。在现阶段上，我们的国民经济中除社会主义的国营经济和合作社经济以外，还有大量的资本主义成分和个体经济。我们还受着帝国主义的包围。为了克服种种困难，顺利地完成这个历史任务，我们的工作人员就该懂得经济知识，特别是关于社会主义经济的知识，通晓各项具体经济问题和领导经济的实际办法。因为有了经济规律的知识，就可以深入地了解经济过程的本质，发觉还处于萌芽状态的进步的发展趋势，科学地预见经济发展的进程，从而能够胜利地完成社会主义建设的任务。因此，认真地学习这本教科书，将大大提高我们的工作人员的政治思想和经济领导工作的水平。
          × × ×
    教科书共分三篇，即：一、资本主义前的生产方式，是论述原始公社制、奴隶占有制、封建主义三种社会经济形态的生产关系和经济发展规律的；二、资本主义的生产方式，是论述资本主义社会经济形态的发生、发展和灭亡的规律的；三、社会主义的生产方式，是论述社会主义社会经济形态的发生和发展过程以及怎样过渡到共产主义社会的。另外，书首有一篇导言，是阐述政治经济学的对象和方法问题的；书末还有一篇结束语，是讲马克思列宁主义政治经济学百余年来经历的道路和教导了我们什么。
    在这三篇当中，社会主义的生产方式的那一篇对于我们当前社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，不仅在理论上而且在实际上都有特殊的指导意义。
    现在我国正处在从新民主主义到社会主义的过渡时期。我党在过渡时期的总路线，就是逐步实现国家社会主义工业化，并逐步实现对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，把我们祖国建成一个伟大的富强的社会主义国家。这一篇第一部分正是全面地阐述从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的一些重要问题的。这里全面而系统地阐述了从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的基本特点；阐述了社会主义工业化的一些问题，如社会主义工业化的意义、本质、速度、方法及资金来源等；阐述了农业集体化的一些问题，如农业集体化的必然性，全盘集体化的前提，全盘集体化和消灭富农阶级，集体农庄的基本形式——农业劳动组合等；并阐述了苏联建成社会主义的各种成就，如社会主义生产方式的确立，社会阶级结构的变化及各民族经济不平等的消灭等。
    这一部分中值得特别指出的是关于过渡时期阶级斗争的特点、关于工人阶级在社会主义建设中的领导作用和工农联盟的必要性、及关于苏维埃政权在过渡时期依据国民经济有计划的发展的规律逐渐限制价值规律作用等问题的论述。
    教科书指出，过渡时期的基本矛盾是社会主义和资本主义间的矛盾。在过渡时期的经济生活的一切领域内，都按照“谁战胜谁”的原则展开着社会主义和资本主义之间的斗争。一方面是工人阶级和基本农民群众，另一方面是资产阶级，他们之间存在着对抗性的不可调和的矛盾。对于过渡时期说来，工人阶级、劳动群众反对资产阶级的阶级斗争的尖锐化是合乎规律的，因为资产阶级的反抗是随着社会主义建设的展开而日益剧烈起来的。
    教科书指出，在过渡时期，每个国家都有下列几种基本的经济成分：社会主义、小商品生产、资本主义，同它相适应的阶级是：工人阶级、小资产阶级（特别是农民）、资产阶级。其中工人阶级从资本主义制度下的被压迫阶级变成了统治阶级，掌握着政权，掌握收归国有的一切生产资料，因而它是国家的领导力量。农民即贫农和中农群众从当政的工人阶级那里得到了土地，摆脱了地主的束缚和富农的盘剥，并得到了经济上的和文化上的全面帮助。农民按其本性说是二重性的：作为私有者，他倾向于资本主义；作为劳动者，他倾向于社会主义。虽然在过渡时期，特别是在农民还是私有者的时候，工人阶级和农民群众之间在某些问题上，如价格问题上，是有某些矛盾的，但是这种矛盾不是对抗性的，不是根本的。而在根本问题上，两个阶级的利益是完全一致的，两者对于消灭剥削和建成社会主义都有切身的利害关系。因此，工人阶级和农民群众可以结成牢固的联盟，而以工人阶级为领导。这种联盟是社会主义建设的基础，是城市和乡村间、工业和农业之间建立正确的经济关系的必要条件，是农业高涨及其社会主义改造的必要条件。只有牢固的工农联盟才能保证资本主义经济成分的消灭和社会主义的完全胜利。
    教科书指出，苏联政府在过渡时期依据国民经济有计划发展的规律，采取了一系列逐渐限制价值规律作用范围的措施。那时苏维埃政权在国营经济范围内实行了直接的计划化，把生产任务一直规定到各个企业，并开始规定了国营企业生产的商品的固定价格。但是在以私有制和小商品生产为基础的农民经济方面，实行这种计划化是不可能的。怎么办呢？国家就用间接的经济调整办法，即通过商业、供应、收购、价格、信用、财政来影响农民经济。苏维埃国家利用这些工具来巩固同农民经济的结合，来加强社会主义经济成分的领导作用。当时价值规律在私人市场上的作用表现为：价格自发地形成，存在着竞争和投机，资本主义分子可以靠牺牲劳动者来发财。为了和资本主义分子作顽强斗争，苏维埃国家把愈来愈多的大量商品集中到自己手里，愈来愈广泛地展开对农产品的收购，同时，开始基本上规定粮食和其他重要商品的价格，用一切办法限制对市场价格的自由投机。
    学习这一部分将使我们更深刻地领会我党在过渡时期的总路线和各项经济政策的理论根据，提高工作中的政策水平。
    目前我国国民经济中，社会主义成分已起领导作用，而且它在全国经济中的比重也不断增长。因
  此，我们面临的一个重大任务，就是如何依据社会主义的经济规律，来领导社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，并获得成功。这一篇第二部分正是以巨大篇幅（第二十六章至三十九章）论述了社会主义经济体系及其发展规律。这里值得我们特别注意的是关于社会主义各种经济规律及如何依据这些规律来顺利地进行社会主义建设的论述。教科书指出：随着社会主义生产关系的产生和发展，在新的经济条件下，一些新的经济规律如社会主义的基本经济规律、国民经济有计划（按比例）发展的规律、劳动生产率不断提高的规律、按劳分配的规律等，便产生了并开始发生作用。这些经济规律所表现的是不受剥削的工作者之间的同志合作和互助的关系。这些经济规律的作用使社会主义经济成分日益发展，使人民福利日益增进。这些社会主义的经济规律，同其他生产方式的经济规律一样，具有客观的性质，它们的产生和发生作用都是不以人们的意志为转移的，都是不能任意创造、制定、改造或废除的。要是忽视或否认这些规律，不按这些规律办事，那就
  一定要产生恶果，引起经济生活的混乱，造成政治上的冒险主义和经济领导工作中的胡作乱为。但是在社会主义社会中人们能够认识这些规律，掌握它们，并利用它们来为社会谋福利。人们愈是充分认识这些规律，在自己的实际活动中愈是准确地反映这些规律的要求，就愈能顺利地达到自己的目的。这一部分对于这些规律的性质、特点和作用，都有专章分别加以论述。
    这一部分对于社会主义制度下的商品生产、价值规律、货币、工资、经济核算、商业、国民收入、国家预算、信用、货币流通、社会主义再生产等问题，都作了科学的阐释。另外，对于社会主义农业问题，也专有一章详尽论述。这里值得特别注意的是对于节约制度的科学论述。节约制度是社会主义的经营方法，其目的是以最少的消耗取得最好的成果。节约的办法就是爱护公共财产，不断降低消耗在产品生产上的活劳动和物化劳动，改进技术，合理地利用人力、物力和财力。遵守节约制度是增加社会主义积累和正确利用积累起来的资金的必要条件，是发展社会主义生产的强大杠杆。因此，在国民经济一切环节和一切管理部门内厉行节约乃是社会主义国家的经济组织活动的一个基本任务。
    这一部分还科学地阐明了共产党和社会主义国家在发展社会主义经济中的领导作用和指导作用。特别是党是社会主义国家的领导核心，它依据对于经济规律的认识，指导一切国家机关和劳动人民社会团体的活动。
    学习教科书这一部分将使我们更多地通晓经济规律的知识，提高经济领导工作的水平。
    现在我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济合作日益发展。这一合作的性质如何？它对我国社会主义建设和保卫世界和平的事业有什么意义？这些问题都是值得我们加以研究的。教科书这一篇第三部分除论述各人民民主国家的社会主义建设和我们中华人民共和国的经济制度以外，对于社会主义阵营各国的经济合作的性质问题还作了深刻的理论的阐述。第二次世界大战后，随着欧亚两洲许多国家的脱离资本主义体系和统一的世界市场的瓦解，这些人民民主国家就和苏联组成社会主义阵营，彼此之间建立起密切的经济合作，同世界资本主义市场相平行，形成了新的世界民主市场。目前参加这一市场的有十二个国家，占地球上陆地面积四分之一，拥有全人类三分之一以上的人口。这个市场拥有极丰富的资源，每个国家都可以在这个市场范围内找到发展本国经济所必需的一切。参加这一市场的各国之间的经济关系和经济合作，随着它们经济建设的增长而日益发展和扩大。这种经济合作的主要形式是对外贸易、贷款、科学技术帮助以及在培养干部方面的合作等等。
    社会主义阵营各国在经济和技术发展水平上虽各不相同，但是它们的经济中占领导地位的都是社会主义经济形式。因此，它们彼此之间的经济关系就有以下的特点：（一）它们之间的经济合作是以社会主义的经济规律为基础，并反映这些规律的要求的，因而是一种历史上从未有过的新型的国际关系。（二）它们之间的经济合作，同社会主义的基本经济规律相适应，服从于一个共同目的，即用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法来最充分地满足劳动人民的不断增长的需要，因而在社会主义阵营中，各国的相互关系乃是同志的合作互助关系，其中没有也不可能有经济扩张、不等价交换、竞争、强国对弱国的剥削和奴役。（三）它们之间的经济合作是计划化的。同国民经济有计划（按比例）的发展的规律相适应，社会主义阵营各国发展国民经济的国家计划都考虑到了彼此之间经济合作的计划。这就保证社会主义阵营各国能适当地利用现有资源来迅速地发展生产力，不断繁荣经济和增进人民的福利。
    学习教科书这一部分将使我们的工作人员更深刻地认识现在我国同苏联和各人民民主国家友好和经济合作的理论根据。
