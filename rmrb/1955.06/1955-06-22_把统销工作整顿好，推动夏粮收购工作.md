    Rectify the Unified Purchase and Sale Work, Promote the Summer Grain Purchase Work

    In many areas, the rectification of grain unified sale work has not yet concluded, and the summer grain purchase work has already begun. Doing both of these tasks well is an important task in the area of grain work at present.
    In most areas of Anhui Province, the rectification of grain work has been effective. With the summer harvest coinciding with the need for rations, the grain unified sales situation has already stabilized. The province's daily grain sales in late May decreased by almost half compared to early May. However, we cannot ignore another new situation: that is, after the summer grain came onto the market, the unified purchase work has been progressing very slowly. This year, the summer grain crop area in Anhui Province has expanded by several million mu compared to last year, and the harvest is generally good. Various localities have made preparations for the summer grain unified purchase work for a long time. These are all favorable conditions for this year's summer grain unified purchase work. However, the amount of summer grain purchased in the first month (May) of the province was much less than in the same period last year. Why is this the case? Of course, this situation is somewhat related to the later season this year and the more urgent need for rations by farmers. However, an important reason is that many areas have not yet rectified the grain unified sales work, and the farmers' concerns have not been completely dispelled, resulting in farmers' reluctance to sell.
    Some rural workers in some places, seeing that farmers now have rations and are no longer clamoring for "grain shortage," want to hastily conclude the rectification of grain unified sales work in hundreds of townships. They have not considered that if the unified sales policy is not thoroughly implemented among the masses, and the ideological concerns of the masses are not eliminated, although there are currently rations and farmers no longer demand grain supplies, this situation is likely to change easily because the ideological problem has not been truly resolved. They also did not consider that under the circumstances that the masses lack a correct understanding of the grain unified purchase and sale policy, the summer grain purchase work will inevitably encounter great difficulties. Now the leading organs of Anhui Province are taking the necessary measures to solve this problem. Leading organs in other regions should also pay attention to it.
    In order to effectively rectify the grain unified sales work, it is necessary to improve working methods and overcome the work style of implementing policies superficially and incompletely; it is necessary to not skimp on effort, do arduous political and economic work, so that the grain unified sales policy is truly understood by the masses and conscientiously implemented. Only in this way can the grain unified sales work be rectified well, making it a driving force for promoting the unified purchase of summer and autumn grains.

    把统销工作整顿好，推动夏粮收购工作
    于明
    许多地区整顿粮食统销工作还没有结束，夏季粮食统购工作又开始了。把这两项工作全都做好，是当前粮食工作方面的重要任务。
    安徽省多数地区整顿粮食工作是有成效的，加以夏季收获接上了口粮，目前粮食统销情况已经稳定。五月下旬全省粮食日销量比五月上旬几乎减少了一半左右。但是，我们不能不注意到另一种新的情况：这就是在夏粮登场以后，统购工作进展很迟缓。安徽省今年夏季粮食作物面积比去年扩大了几百万亩，一般又是丰收，各地对夏粮统购工作早已做了准备，这些都是今年夏粮统购工作的有利条件。但是，全省第一个月（五月份）的夏粮统购数量却比去年同期少得多。这是什么缘故呢？固然，这种情况和今年季节较晚，农民所需口粮比往年急切有些关系。但是，许多地区还没有把粮食统销工作整顿好，农民的疑虑没有完全解除，因而农民产生了惜售思想，也是一个重要原因。
    有些地方的农村工作人员看到农民眼前有了口粮，不再乱嚷“缺粮” 了，就想把几百个乡的整顿粮食统销工作草草结束。他们没有考虑到，不把统销政策深入贯彻到群众中，不消除群众的思想顾虑，虽然目前有了口粮，农民不再要求供应粮食了；但是，由于没有真正解决思想问题，这种情况是很容易变化的。他们也没有考虑到，在群众对粮食统购统销政策缺乏正确认识的情况下，夏粮的收购工作必然遇到很大困难。现在安徽省领导机关正在采取必要的措施解决这个问题。其他地区的领导机关也应该加以注意。
    为了把粮食统销工作切实整顿好，就必须改进工作方法，克服贯彻政策不深不透、浮光掠影的工作作风；就必须不吝惜力量，作艰苦的政治工作和经济工作，使粮食统销政策真正为群众所了解，并认真地执行起来。只有这样，才能把粮食统销工作整顿好，使它成为推动夏粮和秋粮统购工作的动力。
