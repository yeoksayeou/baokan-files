Exposing the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique's Attack on "Literary Monthly"
"Literary Monthly" Editorial Department

In the winter of 1952, "Literary Monthly" was preparing for publication. This was the "journal" that Hu Feng referred to in his letter to Lu Ling as one of the "opening up of positions." Standing in this "position" was Hu Feng clique member Liu Xuewei. At that time, in his capacity as the head of the Literary and Art Department of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, concurrently the director of "New Literature and Art Publishing House" and a member of the editorial board of "Literary Monthly," he attempted to place the only literary journal in East China, like the "New Literature and Art Publishing House," under the control of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, as their tool for opposing the Party, the people, and the revolution.

Although Xuewei's time at "Literary Monthly" was not long, he engaged in anti-Party activities in a planned way, adopting various means to realize their ulterior plans. Looking back now, they had some despicable and vile practices:

First, Xuewei tried his best to make "Literary Monthly" a position for the Hu Feng anti-Party clique to openly spread reactionary ideas, secretly playing tricks in organizing and selecting manuscripts. He tightly grasped the aspect of theoretical criticism. At the editorial board meetings, he put forward Hu Feng clique members Peng Baishan, Mantao, Wang Yuanhua, and others as the main targets for soliciting contributions. For book reviews, he advocated asking people from the "New Literature and Art Publishing House" to write, which of course meant people like Geng Yong and Luo Luo, saying they were very capable of writing. As for creative works, he said it would be good to get some from the "New Literature and Art Publishing House." According to his idea, a large number of various manuscripts came from there, and they were immediately used.

This loyal follower of Hu Feng—Xuewei himself—in his article "On a Problem in Writing Thought" published in the inaugural issue, treated the relationship between life and technique from the viewpoint of bourgeois formalism, equating life and technique, denying the relative independence of technique, and promoting the same erroneous views as Hu Feng. This erroneous thinking was also disseminated to the editorial staff in daily work. When the editorial department internally discussed the orientation and target audience of the monthly, some comrades pointed out that the journal's stated orientation did not reflect the literary and artistic direction put forward by Chairman Mao. Xuewei strongly disagreed, greatly elaborating on his "what to write is not important" "theory," believing that requiring works to write about workers, peasants, and soldiers was "mechanistic." When talking about the target audience of the journal, he denounced the proposal to put workers before students and teachers as "formalism." Once, when a comrade in the editorial department mentioned to him that the articles written by Hu Feng clique members were not good, Xuewei immediately frowned and blamed him, saying: "How can you say that! Literary issues are not that simple, everyone has their own views, you can't demand uniformity!" Xuewei not only greatly "respected" Hu Feng himself, and vigorously promoted Hu Feng's bourgeois subjective idealism, but also prevented others from raising criticisms of Hu Feng clique members.

While Liu Xuewei dispatched a large number of Hu Feng clique members to the New Literature and Art Publishing House, seizing the power of editing and publishing, he also dispatched their clique members to "Literary Monthly." This Hu Feng element, Si Min, who was sent in, was especially valued by Xuewei. After Xuewei left "Literary Monthly," he played the role of informing their criminal group. He was usually seriously arrogant, looked down on everyone, opposed the Party, undermined unity, and openly slandered the Party's person in charge at "Literary Monthly," sowing discord between the editorial board and the editorial office, causing serious damage to the work.

However, the Hu Feng clique's wishful thinking did not work out, and they could not use and control it for a long time. This was because there were other comrades in the editorial board and editorial office who supported and implemented the Party's literary and artistic line; and shortly after the founding of the journal, Xuewei was transferred to the post of Deputy Director of the East China Cultural Bureau, no longer concurrently in charge of the work of "Literary Monthly," and therefore could no longer directly control "Literary Monthly."

Even so, he still sheltered Hu Feng clique members in his capacity as an editorial board member. After the publication of "Research on 'The True Story of Ah Q'" by Geng Yong, a core member of the Hu Feng clique, we received letters from readers criticizing it. Comrade Shi Ling, a member of the editorial board, wrote a critique of the book. During the process of sending it for review, Comrade Xia Yan thought it could be published. When it was sent to Peng Baishan and Liu Xuewei, their opinions were that it was "not well written" and should not be published. Therefore, this criticism could not be展开 (unfolded/developed). Later, Comrade Xia Yan selected two articles from the submissions and published them.

Later, "Literary Monthly" gradually penetrated into the masses and received more concern and support. The eyes of the masses are sharp, and they have raised criticisms of the "theories" and works of the Hu Feng clique members who promote bourgeois idealism, especially Geng Yong's "Research on 'The True Story of Ah Q'." Authors from as far south as Guangdong and as far north as Beijing sent in manuscripts. Although we have not been able to systematically criticize the Hu Feng clique, these "theories" and works of the Hu Feng members clearly have serious errors. Whether from the perspective of the journal's task or from the demands of the masses, we have a responsibility to seriously criticize these. From July 1953 to September 1954, we published seven articles criticizing the works of Hu Feng clique members. In this way, "Literary Monthly," which had always been regarded by the Hu Feng anti-Party clique as "official," became their "sworn enemy," which they had to destroy.

The fierce attack began with the publication of the article criticizing Geng Yong's "Research on 'The True Story of Ah Q'" in the July 1953 issue. Their methods were various, despicable, rogue-like, and they stopped at nothing. As soon as the criticism article was published, Hu Feng clique members spread rumors outside, saying who was using an alias and who was using an alias, adding their usual "flags all over the mountains" and "laying out a suspicious formation" tactics, and smearing "Literary Monthly" with slander, trying to deceive the masses and slander this serious ideological struggle as "personal grievances" and "sectarian prejudices." Hu Feng clique members Wang Rong and Gu Zhengnan brought in articles defending Geng Yong's errors with a tone of abuse. Gu Zhengnan also wrote a letter to satirize Comrades Ba Jin, Huang Yuan, and Tang Tao, in which he wrote: "To be honest, we all grew up on Lu Xun's milk, and we cannot, once the old 'cow' dies, go back and skin 'it' to make leather shoes, and eat 'its' meat to increase our own nutrition..."; and he also brought out Xuewei to fight, saying: "Even Comrade Xuewei, one of your editorial board members, in his 'Lu Xun Essays,' is there any point that is the same as the arguments in the above two articles?" Later letters called the editorial department "quack doctors who always peddle fake medicine." Xu Shihua, the boss of the Hu Feng member "Mud Society," used his wife's name to write letters cursing the editorial department, and they also maliciously gave nicknames to personally attack the person in charge of "Literary Monthly," using all the rogue hooligan methods.

The large-scale, comprehensive attack was after the criticism of the errors made by "Literary Gazette" in handling "Dream of the Red Chamber Research" last October. Hu Feng launched an attack on the Party in Beijing, and the Hu Feng clique in Shanghai echoed it from afar. First, Wang Rong wrote a letter to question the editorial department, and then Geng Yong came to the editorial department to find out the bottom line in order to write an article to counterattack; and Yi Men (A Long) also sent nearly 40,000 words of "shells" from Tianjin. After careful arrangement and division of labor in advance by Hu Feng clique members in Shanghai, at the enlarged meeting of the board of directors of the East China Writers Association, Wang Rong, Geng Yong, and others came out to attack the literary leadership and "open fire" on "Literary Monthly."

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique also tried every means to attack "Literary Monthly" in terms of publication and promotion. Because "Literary Monthly" was published by the New Literature and Art Publishing House, and the power of publication and promotion of the New Literature and Art Publishing House also fell into the hands of Hu Feng members like Hang Xing (i.e., Luo Fei) and Feng Bingxu. Therefore, whenever we negotiated with them on publication and promotion work, they always delayed and prevaricated in various ways, and took all despicable and shameless means to obstruct and destroy our distribution work.

A prominent example is that they boldly withheld instructions from their superiors. In September 1954, the New Literature and Art Publishing House received instructions from the General Administration of Publications regarding the expanded distribution of "Literary Monthly." Hang Xing suppressed it and did not notify us until the end of January this year, when Feng Bingxu unintentionally revealed the spirit of this instruction at a meeting. We immediately asked why he hadn't notified us earlier. He first lied and said: "I notified you long ago." Later he said: "I originally notified Comrade So-and-so orally, but didn't forward the official document to you." When it was confirmed that there was no notification at all, they tried their best to cover up this carefully planned conspiracy, using the excuse: "It must be that the comrades doing the specific work forgot."

Just as "Literary Monthly" was focusing on criticizing Hu Feng, Hu Feng members, in order to reduce the impact of this criticism on the masses, their attack on "Literary Monthly" became even more vicious and rampant. The February issue of this year published several articles criticizing Hu Feng. In order to expand the impact of the struggle, we consulted with the Shanghai Post Office and the director of the New Literature and Art Publishing House, and decided to print 5,000 additional copies. However, when it was sent to print, the Hu Feng members of the New Literature and Art Publishing House even reduced the number of copies without authorization, printing 2,000 fewer copies than originally decided. When we discovered this and went to negotiate, Feng Bingxu still tried every means to quibble, and even insisted on asking us to provide written proof. When we had written proof from the post office, he said that the numbers required by the post office were wrong, and at the same time slandered "Literary Monthly" to the post office, saying that the content was not good, etc. At this time, Hu Feng member Hang Xing cooperated with Feng Bingxu in the promotion work, repeatedly delaying the printing of posters, first claiming that there was no one to design the poster pattern, and then claiming that it would be put off until the next quarter. Despite our insistence, he repeatedly delayed due to design colors and other issues, and finally came up with an extremely ugly pattern. This just coincided with their plan, and could not cooperate with the concentrated struggle to criticize Hu Feng; it was not until late April that two palm-sized leaflets were brought in to perfunctorily deal with the matter.

Such things, large and small, are really readily available. In the past, we thought this was just their capitalist ideology and philistine style, but now we know that it was originally their planned counter-revolutionary conspiracy.

In summary, it can be seen that the Hu Feng clique's conspiracy to undermine "Literary Monthly" was first to have Liu Xuewei preside over it, and collude with other Hu Feng members to use and occupy "Literary Monthly." Later, seeing that this was not feasible, they launched a frantic attack and strike. And the Hu Feng members who controlled the power of publishing and promotion were secretly trying to strangle "Literary Monthly" from behind. Now the conspiracy has finally been exposed. We believe that with the enthusiastic concern and support of the vast number of readers, any conspiracy of the Hu Feng members will not succeed.

    揭露胡风反革命集团对“文艺月报”的进攻
    “文艺月报”编辑部
    一九五二年冬天，“文艺月报”要筹备出版了，这就是胡风在给路翎的信里所指的“开辟岗位”之一的那“一个刊物”。站在这个“岗位”上的是胡风集团分子刘雪苇。那时他以中共中央华东局宣传部文艺处处长的身份，兼“新文艺出版社”社长和“文艺月报”编辑委员，企图将华东唯一的文艺刊物同“新文艺出版社”一样放在胡风反革命集团的控制下面，作为他们反党反人民反革命的工具。
    虽然雪苇在“文艺月报”的时间并不长，但却是有计划地进行反党活动，采取多种多样的手段，来实现他们的不可告人的计划。现在回想起来，他们有这么一些卑鄙、恶劣的做法：
    首先，雪苇尽量使“文艺月报”成为胡风反党集团公开传播反动思想的阵地，在组织稿件、选用稿件上偷偷地要着花样。他紧紧地抓住了理论批评这一方面。在编委会上，他提出了胡风集团分子彭柏山、满涛、王元化等人作为约稿的主要对象；书刊评介呢，他主张约“新文艺出版社”的人来写，当然也就是耿庸、罗洛之流，说他们是很能写稿的；至于创作，他说就向“新文艺出版社”去拿点来好了。依照他的主意，果然从那里来了一大批各种各样的稿子，而且马上都用上了。
    这个胡风的忠实追随者——雪苇自己，就在创刊号所发表的“关于写作思想中的一个问题”一文中，以资产阶级形式主义的观点来看待生活和技巧的关系，把生活和技巧等同起来，否认技巧的相当独立性，宣传着同胡风一样的错误观点。这种错误的思想，也在日常工作中向编辑部同志传播。当编辑部内部讨论月报的方针对象时，有些同志提出从刊物规定的方针上没有体现毛主席提出的文艺方针；雪苇就很不以为然，将他的“写什么并不重要”的“理论”大加发挥，认为要求作品要写工农兵，那是
  “机械论”。谈到刊物的对象，他指斥一定要把工人放在学生教师前面的主张为“形式主义”。有
  一次，编辑部一个同志在他面前提到胡风集团分子所写的文章不好，雪苇立即放下脸来，大加责怪，说：“你怎么这样说！文艺问题不是那么简单，各有各的看法，这不能要求一样！”雪苇不但自己十分“推崇”胡风，极力宣传胡风资产阶级主观唯心主义，而且制止别人对胡风集团分子提出批评意见。
    刘雪苇一面把胡风集团分子大批派进新文艺出版社，掌握了编辑出版的大权。另一面，也同样派遣了他们的集团分子进入“文艺月报”。这个被派进来的胡风分子斯民为雪苇所特别看重。在雪苇离开“文艺月报”以后，他便给他们的罪恶集团起着通风报信的作用。他平时严重的骄傲自大，目中无人，跟党对立，破坏团结，公开地污蔑党在“文艺月报”的负责人，挑拨编委会同编辑室之间的关系等等，给工作带来严重的损失。
    但是胡风集团的如意算盘并没有打成，他们并不能长期利用和控制。这是因为在编委会和编辑室里还有着其他拥护和执行党的文艺方针的同志；而且创刊不久，雪苇就调任华东文化局副局长，不再兼管“文艺月报”的工作，因而也不能再直接控制“文艺月报”了。
    即使如此，他仍然以编委的身份，庇护胡风集团分子。自胡风集团骨干分子耿庸的“‘阿Q正传’研究”出版后，我们收到读者批评的来信，编委石灵同志写了一篇对该书的批评，在送审的过程中，夏衍同志认为可以发表，再送给彭柏山、刘雪苇两人看时，他们的意见都说“写得不好”，不要发表。因此，这一次批评就没有能展开。后来还是夏衍同志在来稿中选定了两篇发表。
    以后，“文艺月报”逐渐地深入到群众中去，得到更多的关心和支持。群众的眼睛是雪亮的，对于宣扬资产阶级唯心论的胡风集团分子的“理论”和作品，特别是耿庸的“‘阿Q正传’研究”纷纷提出了批评。南到广东、北到北京的作者都寄来了稿件。我们虽然还没有能有系统地对胡风集团进行批评，但胡风分子的这些“理论”和作品是显然有着严重错误的。无论从刊物的任务讲，或从群众的要求讲，我们有责任对这些进行严肃的批评。从一九五三年七月起，到一九五四年九月止我们先后发表了七篇批评胡风集团分子作品的文章。这样，一向被胡风反党集团看做是“官方”的“文艺月报”就更成为他们的“死对头”，非要破坏不可了。
    猛烈的进攻是从一九五三年七月号发表了批评耿庸“‘阿Q正传’研究”的文章开始的。他们手段是多种多样，而且卑劣无赖，无所不用其极的。批评文章刚一发表，胡风集团分子就在外面散布谣言，说这是谁的化名、那又是谁的化名，把他们自己用惯的那套“遍山旗帜”“布得成疑阵”的手段，血口喷人的伎俩加在“文艺月报”身上，想用这来蒙混群众，污蔑这场严肃的思想斗争为“私人意气”和 “宗派成见”。胡风集团分子王戎、顾征南拿来夹着谩骂口吻的为耿庸错误辩护的文章。顾征南还来信对巴金、黄源、唐弢同志进行恶毒的讽刺，他的信上写着：“老实说，我们都是吃鲁迅的乳汁长大的，我们不能一旦因为老‘牛’死了，就可以回过去剥‘它’的皮来制革履，吃‘它’的肉来增加自己的营养。……”；而且还抬出雪苇来作战，说：“就是您们编委之一的雪苇同志，他的‘鲁迅散论’中，又有那一点是与以上两篇文章中论点相同呢？”后来的来信则骂编辑部为“惯走江湖卖假药的郎中”。胡风分子“泥土社”老板许史华用老婆的姓名写信谩骂编辑部，他们还恶毒地起绰号，来对“文艺月报”负责人进行人身攻击，一切无赖的流氓手段都用全了。
    大规模的全面的进攻，是在去年十月批评“文艺报”在处理“红楼梦研究”上所发生的错误以后，胡风在北京发动了对党的进攻，胡风集团在上海也遥相呼应，首先是王戎写信来责问编辑部，接着耿庸因为要写文章反攻，还先到编辑部来摸底；而亦门（阿垅）也从天津发来近四万字的“炮弹”。上海的胡风集团分子经过事先的周密的布置、分工，在华东作家协会理事扩大会上，王戎、耿庸等就出马攻击文艺领导并向“文艺月报”“开火”。
    胡风反革命集团还千方百计地在出版、推广方面来进攻“文艺月报”。因为“文艺月报”是在新文艺出版社出版的，而新文艺出版社的出版推广方面的大权，也落在杭行（即罗飞）、冯秉序这些胡风分子手里。所以凡是遇到出版推广方面的工作同他们进行交涉时，他们总是多方拖延推托，并采取一切卑鄙无耻的手段，阻碍和破坏我们的发行工作。
    突出的例子是：他们曾胆大妄为地扣压上级的指示。一九五四年九月，新文艺出版社收到出版总署有关“文艺月报”扩大发行的指示，杭行就压住了一直不通知我们，直到今年一月底，在一次会议上，冯秉序才无意中透露出这个指示的精神。我们立刻追问为何不早通知，他先撒谎说：“早通知你们了。”以后又说：“原来早就口头通知某某同志了，没把公文转你们。”等到对证根本没有通知，他们就又竭力掩饰这个处心积虑的阴谋，托辞说：
  “大约是做具体工作的同志忘记了。”
    正当“文艺月报”集中批判胡风的时候，胡风分子为了减少这一批判在群众中的影响，他们对
  “文艺月报”的进攻也更恶毒猖狂了。今年二月号上刊登了好几篇批判胡风的文章，为了扩大斗争影响，我们和上海邮局、新文艺出版社社长会同商量的结果，决定加印五千份，但当付印时，新文艺出版社的胡风分子竟又擅自减少印数，比原先决定的少印了二千份。等我们发现后去交涉时，冯秉序仍百般狡赖，并且还强硬地反过来要我们出书面证明材料。当我们有了邮局书面材料作证明时，他又说邮局通知所要的数字弄错了，同时并向邮局毁谤“文艺月报”，说内容如何不好等等。这时胡风分子杭行则在推广工作方面和冯秉序协同动作，对印发海报，
  一直借故拖延，先是推说没有设计海报图案的人，后来又推说要放到下一季度来搞。虽经我们坚持，他又借设计颜色等问题再三拖延，最后才拿来一个极难看的图案。这样就恰恰符合了他们的计划，不能配合集中批判胡风的斗争；直至四月下旬，才拿来了印成的两个手掌大小的招贴敷衍塞责。
    这样大大小小的事，真是俯拾即是，过去我们还以为这只是他们资本主义思想、市侩作风，现在知道原来是他们有计划的反革命的阴谋活动。
    总括起来，可以看出胡风集团破坏“文艺月报”的阴谋，先是想由刘雪苇主持，并勾结其他胡风分子、利用和占领“文艺月报”的，后来看看行不通了，就进行疯狂的进攻和打击；而掌握了出版推广大权的胡风分子，则是要偷偷地从背后来扼杀“文艺月报”。现在阴谋终于揭穿了。我们相信在广大读者的热情的关心和支持下，胡风分子的任何阴谋都是不能得逞的。
