    Industrial Capital Construction Must Also Be Economical
    In capital construction, not only must non-productive construction greatly reduce investment and lower standards, but also in productive construction, i.e., industrial capital construction, such as the construction of factories, mines, and railways, it is essential to practice strict economy and overcome waste. The scale of industrial capital construction is huge, occupying a great deal of investment. Some projects require funds of thousands or even tens of thousands of yuan. If any link in the construction process is not carefully attended to, it can cause serious waste. Therefore, paying strict attention to economy in this area is of great significance.
    In his report on "Practicing Economy and Striving to Complete Socialist Construction" on June 13, Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun pointed out: "The main production parts (main workshops, main equipment) of industrial construction should be advanced, but excessively high factory building standards should also be reduced. Auxiliary workshops must proceed from the principles of enterprise specialization and mutual cooperation and integration between enterprises. What can be reduced should be reduced. The design standards and costs of railways and highways should also be reduced as much as possible according to different circumstances." Every construction unit should, based on this direction and combined with the specific circumstances of the unit, carefully calculate and strive to implement the policy of economy in all aspects and at all stages.
    Some people believe that the industrial capital construction plan has been repeatedly reviewed and cannot be changed, otherwise it will affect the balance of all aspects and the progress of the Five-Year Plan. Is it really impossible? Consider the following examples: In the first quarter of this year, state-owned and local state-owned textile departments re-examined the investment of the Five-Year Plan, stopped and postponed some projects, and reduced some reserve funds, under the principle of not affecting the progress of the Five-Year Plan, saving 700 million yuan in funds. The First Ministry of Machine Building revised the product plans of two vehicle factories based on the principle of product balance and more effective use of equipment potential, making them specialize in the production of locomotives and freight cars respectively, saving more than 40 million yuan in construction investment. This shows that all industrial capital construction, under the needs of the state plan and the policy of national balance, can carefully study and review the product plans, equipment production capacity, and construction development prospects of each unit, and can tap the potential for savings in many ways, so as to avoid waste at the beginning of construction.
    Some people believe that the design of some industrial capital construction has been finalized, and some projects have already started partially, and it is too late to save. Is it really too late? Consider the following examples as well: The No. 201 Factory of the Ministry of Heavy Industry recently re-examined the design, stopped the construction of the factory canteen, administrative dispatch room, and timber stacking yard, and reduced unnecessary installation equipment and tools that are not urgently needed, etc., which can save about 3 million yuan without affecting the progress of construction and production. The original design of the state-owned Beijing Third Cotton Textile Factory had a large factory building area. After careful calculation and re-examination of the arrangement of machines, the factory building area can be reduced by more than 1,000 square meters. Both of these factories have already started partial construction. This also shows that if we can seriously examine the necessity of auxiliary workshops and auxiliary equipment for all industrial capital construction based on the spirit of economy, whether the various coefficients of the main workshops are too high, and whether the coordination of various machines and equipment is reasonable, we can also find many ways to save money.
    As for the construction aspect, there are even more places where savings can be made. First of all, doing a good job of construction preparation before construction can avoid waste in many aspects and ensure the progress of the project. Secondly, after the start of construction, striving to ensure balanced construction in all aspects and improving labor productivity is also an important aspect of implementing economy. For example, if the labor productivity of national construction and installation enterprises can be increased by 1% in 1955, then the same number of workers can create more than 40 million yuan worth of work for the country. Again, doing a good job of finishing work after the end of each year or each project to ensure that accumulated materials and funds are not wasted is also a very important task. In the past few years, some construction units and construction companies have accumulated a lot of materials and a lot of surplus funds. These are all a part of the internal resources of the country. In the future, these resources must be fully utilized for construction. This year, twenty-two local state-owned construction units in Shanxi Province have determined to utilize internal resources averaging about 23% of these units' capital construction investment plans for the year; fourteen state-owned construction units have determined to utilize internal resources amounting to about 30% of their investment plans for the year; the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory plans to utilize internal resources amounting to 122% of the factory's construction plan investment for this year. The above is just the situation of some factories in Shanxi Province, and the number of basic construction investments made by the state in Shanxi Province is not the highest in the country; if every construction unit in the country can actively utilize internal resources, it will of course be a great saving for the state's funds.
    Whether it is design or construction, it is essential to use building materials such as steel, wood, and cement sparingly. In the total cost of some projects, building materials generally account for 60% to 70% of the total construction cost, and there is great potential for saving in this area. In the past, the North China and East China Power Design Branches of the Ministry of Fuel Industry replaced the iron towers of high-voltage transmission lines with reinforced concrete frames, which could reduce the cost by one-third; there are many other places where cement or reinforced concrete can replace steel structures. Therefore, saving steel must be listed as one of the country's technical policies. In terms of construction, the procurement, transportation, storage, and use of building materials should also be strengthened and improved. In the past, the work in this area was very chaotic. For example, the materials yard of the new tractor factory, according to the estimates of the local party committee's inspection work group in November last year, lost materials worth about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per day. This chaotic and wasteful situation must be changed quickly.
    To vigorously practice economy in industrial capital construction, in addition to strengthening the technical and organizational management of planning, design, and construction, we should also strengthen the financial supervision of each link, rectify financial discipline, and strictly prevent all illegal acts of false reporting and embezzlement. The Anshan Steel Rolling Construction Engineering Company only spent 358,000 yuan for a backfilling project, but the reported figure greatly exceeded this amount. The actual expenditure of materials for a backfilling project contracted by the Steelmaking Engineering Company was 795,000 yuan, but the reported figure was also much higher. What economy can be said about this kind of over-reporting and embezzlement? Those who violate laws and discipline must be given due punishment in order to maintain financial discipline and implement the system of economy.
    In short, it is entirely possible to implement economy in all aspects from planning, design, and construction in all industrial capital construction, under the principles of ensuring the progress of construction, ensuring the quality of main factory buildings, not reducing necessary construction projects, and not reducing the technical level of production equipment. The leading personnel of all industrial capital construction units must deeply realize that implementing a strict system of economy is the basic method of building socialism, and they must firmly grasp the principle of economy. This is the urgent expectation of the whole Party and the people of the whole country for those engaged in capital construction.

### 工业基本建设也必须节约

    工业基本建设也必须节约
    在基本建设方面，不但非生产性建设必须大大减少投资，降低标准，而且在生产性建设即工业基本建设中，例如工厂、矿山、铁道的建设，也必须厉行节约，克服浪费。工业基本建设的规模巨大，占用的投资很多，若干工程项目动辄需要上千上万元的资金，建设中任何一个环节稍不注意，就会造成严重的浪费。因此，在这方面严格注意节约具有重大的意义。
    国务院副总理李富春同志在六月十三日所作的关于“厉行节约、为完成社会主义建设而奋斗”的报告中指出：“工业建设中的主要生产部分（主要车间、主要设备）应该先进，但过高的厂房标准也要削减。附属车间必须从企业的专业化和企业之间的相互协作、相互结合的原则出发，可减的就减。铁路、公路的设计标准和造价也应根据不同情况尽可能降低。”每一个建设单位都应该根据这个方向，结合本单位的具体情况，精打细算，从各方面和各个环节上努力贯彻节约的方针。
    有人认为，工业基本建设的计划已经反复审订，不可能改变了，否则就会影响各方面的平衡和五年计划的进度。果真不可能吗？请看下面的例子：今年第一季度，国营和地方国营纺织部门，重新研究了五年计划的投资，在不影响五年计划进度的原则下，停建和缓建了一些工程，减少了一部分预备费，就节约了七亿元资金。第一机械工业部根据产品平衡和更有效地发挥设备潜力的原则，将两个车辆工厂的产品方案修正了一下，使它们分别专门生产机车和货车，就节约了建设投资四千余万元。这说明一切工业基本建设，在国家的计划需要和全国平衡的方针下，慎重地研究和审查每一个单位的产品方案、设备生产能力、建设发展远景，就可以从很多方面发掘节约的潜力，在建设一开始的时候就能避免浪费。
    有人认为，有些工业基本建设的设计已经定了，有些工程已经局部开工了，节约已经晚了。果真晚了吗？也请看以下的例子：重工业部二○一厂最近重新审查设计，停建了厂区食堂、事务调度室、木材堆置场，减少了不必需安装的设备和不急需购置的工具等等，可以在不影响建设的进度和生产的条件下节约三百万元左右。国营北京第三棉纺织厂原设计的厂房面积较大，最近经过精密计算，重新研究了机器的排列位置，就可以缩小厂房面积一千多平方公尺。而这两个工厂都是已经开始局部施工了的。这也说明了如果能根据节约精神，认真审查一切工业基本建设的附属车间和附属设备是否必要，主要车间的各种系数是否偏高，各种机器设备的配合是否合理等方面的问题，也可以从中寻找出很多节约的方法。
    至于施工方面，可以节约的地方就更多了。首先，在施工以前做好施工准备，就可以在很多方面避免浪费，并保证工程的进度。其次，开工以后，从各方面努力保证均衡施工，提高劳动生产率，这也是贯彻节约的一个重要方面。例如：一九五五年全国建筑安装企业的劳动生产率如果能提高百分之一，那末，同样多的工人，就可为国家多创造价值四千多万元的工作量。再次，在每年或每项工程结束以后，做好收尾工作，保证积压的器材和资金不致浪费，也是一项很重要的工作。在过去几年中，一些建设单位和施工单位积压的器材很多，结余的资金也不少，这些都是国家内部资源的一个组成部分，今后必须把这些资源充分运用到建设事业上来。山西省二十二个地方国营建设单位，今年确定运用的内部资源，平均为这些单位本年度基本建设投资计划的百分之二十三左右；十四个国营建设单位确定运用的内部资源，为本年度投资计划的百分之三十左右；太原重型机器厂计划动用的内部资源，为该厂今年建设计划投资额的百分之一百二十二。以上还只是山西省一部分工厂的情况，而国家在山西省境内的基本建设投资数在全国来说还不是最高的；如果全国每一个建筑单位都能积极运用内部资源，对国家资金当然是很大的节约。
    不论是设计和施工，都必须节约使用钢铁、木材和水泥等建筑材料。在若干工程的全部造价中，建筑材料一般都占建筑总成本的百分之六十至七十，在这方面注意节约，潜力也是很大的。过去，燃料工业部华北、华东等电业设计分局，把高压送电线的铁塔改用钢筋混凝土的架子，就可以降低三分之一的造价；其它能用水泥或钢筋混凝土代替钢铁结构的地方也很多。因之必须把节约钢材列为国家的技术政策之一。在施工方面，也应该加强和改进建筑材料的采购、运输、保管和使用工作。过去，这方面的工作是十分混乱的，例如新建拖拉机厂的材料场，根据去年十一月地方党委的检查工作小组的估计，每天损失材料约值二、三千元。这种混乱和浪费的情况，是必须迅速改变的。
    在工业基本建设中厉行节约，除了要加强计划、设计、施工各环节的技术和组织管理而外，还应该加强各个环节的财务监督，整顿财政纪律，并严密地防止一切虚报冒领的违法行为。鞍山轧钢建筑工程公司作的一项回填工程，实际支出只有三十五万八千元，上报时却大大超过这个数目。炼钢工程公司承包的一项回填工程，用料的实际支出是七十九万五千元，上报时也多报了很多。这种多报冒领的行为，还能说什么节约呢？对这些违法乱纪的人员，必须给以应得的处分，才能维护财政纪律，贯彻节约制度。
    总之，一切工业基本建设，在保证建设进度、保证主要厂房的质量、不减少必需的建设项目和不降低生产设备的技术水平的原则下，从计划、设计、施工各方面实行节约是完全可能的。一切工业基本建设单位的领导人员，必须深深地认识到实行严格的节约制度乃是建设社会主义的基本方法，必须紧紧掌握节约的原则。这是全党和全国人民对从事基本建设的人员的迫切的期望。
