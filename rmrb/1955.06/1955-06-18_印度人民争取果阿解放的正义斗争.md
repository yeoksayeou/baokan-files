    The Indian People's Just Struggle for the Liberation of Goa
    The Communist Party of India's Central Committee's Call
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India, currently meeting in Delhi, passed a resolution on the 15th calling on the Indian people to further expand the struggle for the liberation of Goa.
    The resolution pointed out, "The Indian people have the undeniable right and obligation to most fully assist their Goan compatriots in their struggle for liberation and unification with India."
    The resolution condemned Portugal's brutal repression in Goa and the support of imperialist countries for Portugal. The resolution stated, "The whole of Goa is now a fascist armed camp, where more than 15,000 foreign troops are using torture and barbaric repression to suppress the people's freedom movement. A small country like Portugal is able to pursue this policy because of the support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization controlled by the United States and Britain, which is completely unjustified."
    The resolution said, "Free India can no longer tolerate foreign rule continuing on even one inch of its territory."
  Talk by the Indian Minister of Home Affairs
    According to a report in the "Hindustan Times" on the 15th, the Indian Minister of Home Affairs, Pant, said at a mass meeting in Nainital on the 14th that no matter how much intimidation and threats the Portuguese carry out, they cannot deprive the Goan people of their inherent right to return to the embrace of India. He said that Goa will surely gain freedom.
  All Parties Support the Struggle to Liberate Goa
    According to a report in the "Indian Express," representatives of all parties in India held a meeting in Delhi on June 15th, and a committee to support the Goa peaceful resistance movement was formed at the meeting. Participants pointed out that Goa is a part of India, and India cannot tolerate Portugal pursuing colonialism on Indian territory. The committee will convene various mass meetings to mobilize the people to support the struggle for the liberation of Goa.
    On the same day, Goa National Movement leader Dr. Gaitonde said at a press conference in Bombay: If a free and fair vote were held in Portugal, 80 percent of Portuguese people would vote in favor of Goa gaining freedom. Gaitonde was exiled from Goa to Portugal last March, and he returned to Bombay on June 14th.
    According to a report from the United News of India, Portuguese authorities in Daman (Portuguese territory) shot twenty African soldiers for refusing to fire on unarmed peaceful resistance movement participants. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    印度人民争取果阿解放的正义斗争
    印度共产党中央的号召
    目前正在德里举行会议的印度共产党中央委员会在十五日通过了一项决议，号召印度人民进一步展开争取果阿解放的斗争。
    决议指出，“印度人民有不容置疑的权利和义务来最充分地援助果阿同胞进行争取解放和同印度合并的斗争。”
    决议谴责葡萄牙在果阿的残暴镇压和帝国主义国家对葡萄牙的支持。决议说：“整个果阿现在是一个法西斯武装兵营，一万五千多名外国军队在那里以酷刑和野蛮的镇压手段来压制人民的自由运动。像葡萄牙这样的小国所以能够奉行这种政策，是由于得到美国和英国所控制的北大西洋公约组织的支持，这种支持是完全不正当的。”
    决议说，“自由印度再也不能容忍外国甚至于在它的一寸领土上继续进行统治。”
  印度内政部长的谈话
    据“印度斯坦时报”十五日报道，印度政府内政部长潘特十四日在奈尼塔尔的群众大会上说，不论葡萄牙人进行多大的恫吓和威胁，都不能剥夺果阿人民要求回到印度怀抱里来的天赋的权利。他说，果阿一定会获得自由。
  各党派支援解放果阿的斗争
    据“印度快报”报道，印度各党派代表六月十五日在德里举行会议，会上组成了支援果阿和平抵抗运动委员会。参加会议的人指出，果阿是印度的一部分，印度不能容忍葡萄牙在印度的领土上推行殖民主义。委员会将召开各种群众大会，动员人民支援果阿争取解放的斗争。
    同一天，果阿民族运动领袖盖童德博士在孟买举行的记者招待会上说：如果在葡萄牙举行自由的和公正的投票的话，百分之八十的葡萄牙人都会投票赞成果阿获得自由。盖童德是去年三月被从果阿放逐到葡萄牙去的，他于六月十四日回到了孟买。
    另据印度统一通讯社的消息说，葡萄牙当局在达曼（葡萄牙属地）枪毙了二十个非洲籍的士兵，因为他们拒绝向手无寸铁的和平抵抗运动的人开枪。　（据新华社讯）
