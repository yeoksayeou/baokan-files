    Japanese Farmers' Life and Farmers' Movement
    Xiao Chuan Fengming, Head of the Japanese Agricultural Delegation to China
      (I)
    Today, after the end of World War II, 38 million Japanese farmers, accounting for more than four-tenths of the total population, are forced to engage in extremely difficult production and live extremely painful lives under the rule of the American semi-colony and the militarization of the country's territory.
    It is true that Japan has carried out agricultural land reforms since 1947. About 40% of the 5.5 million hectares of land formerly owned by landlords, of which more than 80% was leased land, were basically handed over to farmers after receiving compensation; at the same time, at least on the surface, the high in-kind rent, which used to reach half of the harvest, was abolished. However, Japan's land reform is different from China's land reform, which was carried out by workers and farmers for the benefit of farmers. The purpose of Japan's land reform was to stop farmers' struggles and to break the connection between farmers and workers. Not only do forests, which are indispensable for farmers' production and life, remain in the hands of landlords, but there are also many shortcomings in other aspects. Although farmers have been given the title of landowners, the average land obtained by each household is less than one hectare, and the decentralization of production has not changed at all. Backward and undemocratic political relations in rural areas still exist.
    Moreover, in the new conditions of the American semi-colonial rule after the war, Japanese farmers have suffered more severe and diverse exploitation than before the war.
    First, according to the US-Japan Administrative Agreement signed under the San Francisco Sole Peace Treaty and the US-Japan Security Treaty, the United States has established 800 military bases in Japan, which not only makes the shortage of land for Japanese farmers more serious, but sometimes even takes the lives of Japanese farmers.
    Second, in the name of grain requisition, the government forcibly purchases most of the grain produced by farmers at a low price that is insufficient to cover costs. For example, in 1954, Japanese farmers requested a price of 12,000 yen per koku of rice based on the lowest estimate, but the government completely ignored this and forcibly stipulated a purchase price of less than 10,000 yen, including so-called bonuses. The government forcibly stipulated such a low rice price in order to facilitate the monopoly capitalists to lower workers' wages and obtain the maximum amount of high profits. This is a means of trying to restore the national economy by intensifying the exploitation of workers and farmers. At the same time, the government tells farmers that if the price of rice is raised, it will affect the lives of workers; and tells workers that if wages are increased, the prices of fertilizers and agricultural tools will be increased accordingly, using this statement to sow discord between workers and farmers.
    Third, the United States' forced import of 3 million to 4 million tons of surplus grain into Japan every year also makes the situation of Japanese farmers more difficult. It is true that Japan suffers from food shortages and needs to import a considerable amount of food from abroad. However, the past government did not seriously consider the issue of increasing production to solve the food shortage, but followed the requirements of the United States and continued to increase military spending for rearmament, while the state financial expenditure for increasing food production gradually decreased instead. For Japanese farmers, not only is there no increase in production, but also because of constant disasters, they are now facing the threat of abandoning production. The food that Japan imports from the United States is by no means an equal transaction, but is conditional on undertaking the obligation to strengthen rearmament. This huge import, of course, destroys Japan's trade balance and becomes a major factor in deepening Japan's foreign exchange shortage crisis.
    Fourth, Japanese farmers also suffer great losses due to the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products. The prices of the products they sell are suppressed very low, while the materials they need to buy for production and life, especially fertilizers, agricultural tools, and pesticides, are very expensive. This allows the monopoly capitalists who hold these commodities to obtain huge profits.
    Finally, it must also be pointed out the heavy tax burden suffered by Japanese farmers. It is often said that the rent paid by farmers to landlords before the war has now been replaced by various heavy taxes. Taking the most important income tax as an example, before the war, income tax accounted for only a few percent of farmers' income, while after the war it has averaged more than 20% of farmers' income, and the number of farmers paying income tax has also greatly increased. Due to the fierce tax resistance struggle of farmers, the government implemented tax system reform in 1949, which somewhat reduced income tax. However, recently, due to the financial difficulties of the state and local governments, the burden on farmers under the names of local taxes, apportionments, and donations has become heavier and heavier. If the increase in indirect consumption tax is also taken into account, the oppression suffered by farmers due to bearing public taxes can be said to be extremely heavy.
      (II)
    Under the heavy pressure of such harsh conditions, the production and life of Japanese farmers after the war is more difficult than before the war, and this situation has become increasingly significant recently.
    In terms of agricultural production, even in rice paddies that produce major crops, the average area under cultivation and the average yield have tended to decrease after the war compared with before the war. Moreover, the area of cultivated land affected by wind and water disasters, diseases and insect pests has also reached more than twice that of before the war.
    As for the living conditions of farmers, it is true that during a short period of inflation after the war, the soaring prices of agricultural products on the black market seemed to have brought some prosperity to farmers. Also, farmers who became owner-farmers due to land reform had a somewhat increased enthusiasm for production, and there were also signs of efforts to improve technology and increase production. However, this phenomenon was only like rootless grass growing on a fragile foundation, and it withered in an instant. At present, even according to government statistics, less than two-tenths of Japanese farmers rely entirely on agriculture for their livelihoods. Most other farmers barely maintain their lives by doing temporary work, working away from home, and other side jobs. Moreover, these job opportunities are becoming less and less, and unemployment is expanding day by day. In fact, recently, in rural areas of the Tohoku region, the number of farmers who have abandoned their land and even sold their own daughters has increased considerably. In rural areas everywhere, the second and third sons who have not been allocated land and cannot find work are the most troublesome problem.
      (III)
    Originally, Japanese farmers, like Chinese farmers, are hardworking. For many years, they have struggled with difficult conditions, improved technology, increased productivity, and shouldered the heavy responsibility of supplying food and industrial raw materials to the people. But despite this, today they themselves cannot grasp such achievements, and have lost the conditions to further improve technology and develop productivity on the basis of such achievements. The fundamental reason is that Japan is now in fact in a state of American semi-colony, with extremely fragile economic power, but is forced to rearm, and all sacrifices are concentratedly shifted to workers and farmers, and sufficient measures to protect agricultural production have not been taken.
    Therefore, all Japanese farmers must resolutely reject this semi-colonial forced rearmament, and strive for richer and fully guaranteed agricultural production in a truly peaceful life without fear of war. Japanese farmers urgently hope to be able to give full play to their strengths, and they are now fighting for this.
    Japanese farmers have a glorious tradition of struggle. Before the war, Japanese farmers, with the struggle against high rents as the center, expanded the struggle against reactionary rule and landlord exploitation to the whole country. The Japanese fascist forces carried out extremely cruel suppression of this struggle, and the leaders of the farmers' movement were often arrested and imprisoned. However, the flame of this struggle was not extinguished even in the extremely cruel environment during the war.
    After the war, this tradition of struggle was inherited, and in the new domestic and international objective situation, the struggle of Japanese farmers has expanded and deepened. The struggle to confiscate landlord land, oppose military bases, oppose heavy taxes, and oppose forced grain requisition at low prices replaced the pre-war struggle against high rents and became the center of farmers' struggles. Due to the so-called land reform and the class differentiation policy based on it, and due to the repeatedly strengthened suppression and persecution, the struggle of Japanese farmers later fell into very difficult circumstances. At the same time, the farmers' movement itself also had great shortcomings. Not enough efforts were made to consolidate the leadership of the poor peasants and strengthen the alliance between farmers and workers, and the sectarianism of the cadres of the farmers' movement also brought great losses to the movement. As a result, the farmers' movement stagnated for a long time, the front of the farmers' movement was repeatedly split, and the organization was forced to become weak and powerless.
    However, this situation has recently begun to be overcome. Under the policy of forcibly implementing the US-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement and rearmament, many Japanese farmers now clearly realize through their daily life experiences who are the enemies and who are the friends, and keenly feel that in order to strive for their own peaceful and happy lives, they must first strengthen their own struggle organizations. Japanese farmers have learned from their past painful experiences that they must form a broad united front with the poor peasants as the core, and must permanently and closely unite with the workers. Moreover, only by forming a strong united front of the broad masses of people demanding independence and peace with a solid worker-peasant alliance as the core can the US-Japan reactionary forces be isolated and their reactionary rule be smashed. This trend has already emerged throughout the country.
      (IV)
    At the same time, Japanese farmers have also deepened their understanding of international connections, and they especially demand to strengthen friendly cooperation with the Chinese farmers who are their closest neighbors. Japanese farmers, like Chinese farmers, love peace. They both shoulder the heavy responsibility of rapidly increasing the production of food and industrial raw materials for the people. Therefore, Japanese farmers urgently hope to exchange valuable experiences with each other, modestly learn from each other's excellent production organizations and technologies, and promote the establishment of normal institutions for necessary material exchanges with each other.
    It is precisely because of this that our Japanese agricultural delegation's visit to China this time is by no means just our wish, but is due to the will and hope of all Japanese farmers. We are representing them.

    日本的农民生活和农民运动
    日本农业访华代表团团长　小川丰明
      （一）
    第二次世界大战结束后的今天，占全国总人口十分之四以上的三千八百万日本农民，在美国半殖民地的统治和国土军事基地化的情况下，被迫从事着极困难的生产和过着极痛苦的生活。
    诚然，日本从一九四七年起是进行了农地改革的。从前地主所有的占全部耕地五百五十万公顷的十分之四左右的土地，其中出租土地的百分之八十以上，在得到代价后基本上交给了农民；同时，至少是在表面上，取消了过去达到收获量半数的高额实物地租。但是，日本的农地改革，和中国的为农民利益而由工人农民进行的土地改革不同。日本的农地改革，目的是为了制止农民的斗争，是为了破坏农民和工人的联系。不但农民生产和生活上所不可缺少的森林现在仍留在地主手中，而且其他许多方面也都有着很多缺点。农民虽然被加上了土地所有者的名义，可是每户所得的土地，平均还不足一公顷，生产的分散性一点也没有改变。农村中的落后的、不民主的政治关系也依然存在。
    不仅如此，战后的日本农民，在美国的半殖民地统治的新条件下，受到了比战前更沉重的多种多样的剥削。
    首先，根据旧金山单独和约和美日安全条约而签订的美日行政协定，美国在日本建立了八百个军事基地，这不但使日本农民缺少土地的情况更趋严重，而且有时甚至夺去了日本农民的生命。
    第二，政府在征粮的名义下，强制用不够成本的低贱价格收购了农民生产的大部分粮食。例如：在一九五四年，日本农民按最低的估计、要求每一日石大米的价格为一万二千日圆，而政府对此全然置之不理，强制规定了加上所谓奖励金还不足一万日圆的收购价格。政府强制规定这种低贱的米价，是为了有利于垄断资本家压低工人工资、以获取最大限度的高额利润。这是企图用加强对工人和农民的剥削来恢复国家经济的一种手段。同时，政府又对农民说，如果提高米价就要影响工人生活；对工人说，如果增加工资就要相应地提高肥料、农具的价格，用这种说法来挑拨离间工人和农民的关系。
    第三，美国每年强制输入日本三百万吨到四百万吨的剩余粮食，也使日本农民的处境更加困难。不错，日本苦于粮食不足，需要从国外输入相当数量的食粮。可是过去的政府并没有认真考虑过解决食粮不足的增产问题，而是遵照美国的要求，不断增加重新武装的军费，增产食粮的国家财政支出却反而逐渐减少。对日本农民来说，不仅说不上增加生产，而且因为灾害不断，现在正面临着荒废生产的威胁。日本从美国输入的食粮，决不是平等的交易，而是以承担加强进行重新武装的义务为交换条件的。这种巨大的输入，当然破坏了日本的贸易平衡，成为加深日本外币不足危机的主要因素。
    第四，日本农民由于工农业产品的剪刀差，也受到很大损失。他们卖出的产品，价格被压得很低，而他们要买进的生产上、生活上所必需的物资，特别是肥料、农具、农药等，都非常高昂。这样就使得握有这些商品的垄断资本家获得了巨额利润。
    最后，还必须指出日本农民所受的重税的盘剥。甚至常常有人说：战前农民向地主缴纳的地租，现在已经为各种重税顶替了。就以捐税中最主要的所得税为例，战前所得税不过占农民收入的百分之几，而战后平均已超过了农民收入的二成，而且缴纳所得税农户的数字也大大增多了。由于农民激烈的抗税斗争，政府在一九四九年实施了税制改革，才多少减轻了一些所得税。可是最近由于国家、地方的财政困窘，在地方税、摊派款项、捐款等名目下，加在农民身上的负担越来越重，如果再把间接消费税的增加计算在内，农民由于负担公税而受的压迫，可以说是极其沉重的。
      （二）
    在这样的恶劣条件的重重压榨下，战后日本农民的生产和生活，比战前更加困难，这种情况最近是越来越显著了。
    从农业生产方面来说，甚至生产主要农作物的稻田，耕种面积和收获量的平均数字，战后也有比战前减少的倾向。而且，风灾水灾、病害虫害的受灾耕地面积，也达到战前的一倍以上。
    至于农民的生活情况，固然在战后通货膨胀的一个短时期中，由于农产品黑市价格暴涨，似乎给农民带来了部分繁荣。还有由于农地改革而成为自耕农的农民，生产情绪多少有些增涨，也有努力改良技术、提高生产的迹象。然而，这种现象只不过是好像生长在脆弱基础上的没有根的草，转瞬间就枯萎了。目前，即使根据政府的统计，日本完全依靠农业而生活的农民，也不足十分之二。其他大多数农民，是靠做临时工、出外谋生等等副业来勉强维持生活的。而且这种工作机会也越来越少，失业现象正在日益扩展。事实上，最近东北地方的农村中，放弃土地甚至出卖亲生女儿的农民也相当增加了。各地农村中，没有分得的土地、又找不到工作做的次子、三子（译注），是最令人头痛的问题。
      （三）
    本来，日本农民和中国农民同样，是勤劳的。多少年来，他们和困难的条件斗争着，改良技术，提高生产力，担负着供给民食和工业原料的重责。但是尽管如此，今天他们自己却不能掌握这样的成果，失去了在这样成果的基础上进一步提高技术、发展生产力的条件。这根本的原因是：现在日本事实上是处在美国的半殖民地的状态下，经济力极其脆弱，却被迫重新武装，一切的牺牲都被集中地转嫁到工人和农民身上，而且没有充分采取保障农业生产的措施。
    因此，日本全体农民必须断然拒绝这种半殖民地的强迫重新武装，而在真正和平的没有战争顾虑的生活之中，争取更丰富的、充分受到保障的农业生产。日本农民迫切希望能够充分地发挥他们的特长，现在，他们正为此而进行着斗争。
    日本农民本来有着光辉的斗争传统。战前，日本农民就曾以反对高额地租的斗争为中心、把反对反动统治和地主剥削的斗争扩大到全国范围。日本法西斯势力对这一斗争进行了极其残酷的镇压，农民运动的领导者经常被捕入狱。然而，这一斗争的火光甚至在战时极其残酷的环境中也没有被扑灭。
    战后，这样的斗争传统被承继下来，而且在新的国内和国际客观情势中，日本农民的斗争更扩展更深入了。没收地主土地、反对军事基地、反对重税、反对低价强制征粮等等斗争代替了战前的反对高额地租的斗争，成为农民斗争的中心。由于所谓农地改革以及在这基础上的阶级分化政策，由于反复加强的镇压和迫害，后来日本农民的斗争陷入了很困难的境地。同时，农民运动本身也有着很大缺点，对于巩固贫农的领导、加强农民和工人的联盟的努力，都做得不够，农民运动干部的宗派主义也给运动带来很大损失。结果，使农民运动在很长时期中停滞不前，农民运动的战线一再分裂，组织被迫陷于软弱无力。
    不过，这种情况最近已经开始有所克服。在强制执行美日共同防御援助协定重新武装的政策之下，日本很多农民现在通过日常生活的体验清楚地认识了谁是敌人、谁是朋友，并且痛切地感到为了争取自己的和平和幸福的生活，首先必须加强本身的斗争组织。日本农民从过去惨痛的经验中，认识了必须以贫农为核心结成广泛的统一战线，必须和工人永久地紧紧团结在一起。而且，只有以巩固的工农联盟为核心，结成强大的要求独立、和平的广大人民的统一战线，才能使美日反动势力陷于孤立，才能粉碎他们的反动统治，这种动向已经在全国各地出现了。
      （四）
    与此同时，日本的农民也日益加深了对于国际联系的认识，他们特别要求加强和最邻近的中国农民的友好合作。日本农民和中国农民一样地热爱和平。他们都担负着迅速提高供给人民食粮和工业原料作物生产的重责。因而日本农民迫切希望相互交换宝贵的经验，相互虚心地学习优良的生产组织和技术，促进相互建立必要的物资交流的正常机构。
    正因为如此，我们日本农业代表团这次的访问中国，也决不仅仅是我们的意愿，而是由于全体日本农民这样的意志和希望，我们是代表他们的。
    译注：日本农村的传统习俗，农民财产的继承权属于长子。
