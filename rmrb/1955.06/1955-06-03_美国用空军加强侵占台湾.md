Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 2nd. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Twining stated on the 2nd that the area of responsibility of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force has been expanded to include the Taiwan area. Previously, its area of responsibility was mainly concentrated in the Philippines.

This measure by the United States to intensify its illegal armed occupation of the Taiwan area is in complete contradiction with the desire of the people of the world to ease the tension in this area. The United States already has a permanently stationed air squadron in Taiwan, and is constantly strengthening the Chiang bandit air force and expanding airfields.

    美国用空军加强侵占台湾
    新华社二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国空军参谋长特文宁二日发表声明说，美国第十三航空队的责任范围已经扩大到把台湾地区包括在内。在这以前，它的责任范围主要集中在菲律宾。
    美国这种加紧对台湾地区的非法武装侵占的措施，同世界人民要求缓和这一地区紧张局势的愿望完全相违反。美国目前在台湾已经经常驻扎一个空军中队，并且在不断加强蒋贼空军和扩建飞机场。
