Letters from 194 propaganda, cultural, and art workers from the Navy stationed in Beijing, including Li Junyan, Liu Yi, and Guo Jingren: We have finished reading the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group with immense indignation. We all believe that this batch of materials has nakedly exposed the master of the heinous Hu Feng and his gang of lackeys!

Who is their master? It is the imperialists and their running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique! What is their "strategy"? It is the trick commonly used by all hidden professional secret agents! What is their "cause"? It is to subvert the people's revolutionary regime and restore the rule of imperialism and the Chiang bandits in China! What are the basic backbones of them? They are secret agents, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, traitors to the revolution, renegades, and enemies of the people! The ironclad evidence is irrefutable!

We are propaganda, cultural and artistic workers of the agencies and troops of the Navy stationed in Beijing. Our task is to cooperate with various departments and brother units to liberate Taiwan and defend our great motherland. For this glorious task, all officers and men of our Navy are working hard and fighting bravely. Some have shed blood, and some have already given their precious lives. We cherish the fruits of victory won with blood and sweat and will not allow anyone to destroy them! But just as we were advancing victoriously, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group secretly launched an attack on the revolution from behind! This is absolutely intolerable! We unanimously condemn the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group! We firmly demand that the backbone elements of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary group be severely punished according to law! And we demand a thorough investigation of all their conspiracies and activities, and that this evil counter-revolutionary group be wiped out in one fell swoop!

Letter from Liu Dachao and 60 others from the Trade Union Committee of the China Seamen's Union: After reading the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group," we are even more angry. We firmly demand the complete smashing of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and the removal of this group of counter-revolutionaries from the ranks of the people. We demand the prompt revocation of Hu Feng's qualification as a deputy to the National People's Congress and the immediate arrest and punishment of Hu Feng and the chief culprits of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

In recent days, through study and discussion, our political vigilance has been greatly improved. We guarantee that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will further study hard, raise our awareness, strengthen revolutionary vigilance, prevent any complacency, and completely smash the conspiracy activities of all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and in the future, we will wage a persistent struggle against all counter-revolutionaries at any time and any place. The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao is wise, and the united strength of the people of the whole country is great. No counter-revolutionary group or counter-revolutionary element, no matter how cleverly disguised, can escape the giant palms of the people of the whole country in the end. They will surely be smashed to pieces under the iron fists of the people of the whole country. Our cause is just, and no enemy can stop us from advancing victoriously on the road to socialism and communism.

Letter from Ju Qiyu and Sun Baoqi of the Second Working Zone of the Tianjin Second Construction Engineering Company: After reading the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily" on June 10, we have further recognized the evil nature of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, and we can no longer suppress our resentment.

In recent years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, brilliant achievements have been made in all aspects of work. We Chinese people all believe that it is a matter of pride to live in today's society, and we also have unshakable confidence in building a better socialist society in the future. The more rapidly our cause develops and the stronger the people's regime becomes, the more unwilling the enemies of the people become. The conspiracy activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are one example of the increasing acuteness of class struggle today. Hu Feng's tricks are sinister and vicious. From the third batch of materials, we have further recognized that Hu Feng and his group members have been counter-revolutionaries lurking in the revolutionary camp for many years.

Therefore, we request the relevant departments to severely punish Hu Feng and his accomplices according to the law based on their crimes.

Letter from all students of Beijing Foreign Trade Institute: We express our incomparable anger at the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. Students in all classes of our institute have gathered one after another to denounce Hu Feng and unanimously demand the complete smashing of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

After the "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group on June 10, the face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group can be seen more clearly. The backbone elements of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are all loyal running dogs of the imperialist Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionaries. They have long had close ties with Kuomintang secret service agencies. After liberation, they put on the guise of progressives and sneaked into the revolutionary ranks to continue their sinful activities of opposing the Party and opposing the revolution. From their many correspondence letters, it can be seen that they actively support Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang and have deep-seated hatred for the Communist Party. They hope for the restoration of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang and try every possible means to sabotage and resist everything in New China and the victory of the people's revolution. Their counter-revolution is planned, programmed, and tactical. Like all secret agents and assassins, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has the imperialist Chiang Kai-shek reactionary faction as its backstage. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has long been determined to "either do nothing or do everything" and resolutely, thoroughly, oppose the Party, oppose the revolution, and oppose the people.

Now, the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, their wolfish ambitions and dog-like hearts, have been clearly exposed to the people. Their counter-revolutionary crimes must be punished accordingly. They are the mortal enemies of the people and the mortal enemies of our youth. They have been hiding in the revolutionary ranks for more than 20 years. We have been deceived by them for a long time in the past, and we must never tolerate them any longer. In order to protect our great socialist construction cause, we resolutely demand that the backbone elements of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary group be punished according to law, that the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group be thoroughly investigated, and that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group be completely eliminated.

Letter from Bi Keguan and Wang Dejuan, students of the Department of Dramatic Literature of the Central Academy of Fine Arts: We just sent a letter to the newspaper on the 9th requesting the punishment of Hu Feng, and on the 10th, we saw the third batch of materials on their reactionary crimes, which made us even more angry, and we cannot but once again ask the government to severely punish them!

The new materials prove that the broad masses' suspicion of their political background is correct. Many of them have a sinful history. It turns out that A Long was a "major" in Chiang's bandit army! Lü Yuan was a special agent of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization"! And Hu Feng himself was a traitor to the revolution and an active "anti-communist"!

They infiltrated the Party, government organs, and people's organizations by any means. In order to expand their power, win people over, and win people over, in addition to "shaking hands and talking happily," they also "applied" to join the Party! They regarded joining the Party as their "struggle." How much they pretend – well-behaved, not complaining, really "progressive."

They are irreconcilable with the Party and the people. Look! Slandering the masses of people for following the great and dear Party as "worshiping gods," slandering the revolutionary forces of the people as "rotten corpses" and "pus," it is no wonder that the reactionary ringleader Hu Feng resolutely told his lackeys: "... cut off my head" and "throw it out" to "smash" the copper wall and iron wall of the people. This reactionary fellow could not wait to have his corpse still serve their "cause" after his death.

However, we want to shout loudly: The "pus" is you, and it is also you who are being "discharged," and it is also you who are being "smashed." We are irreconcilable with you! We must make you "finished"!

In the struggle, as the "People's Daily" pointed out, we have always been too naive. Our political sense of smell is not sensitive, so that these reactionary elements have taken advantage of the loopholes. But we will learn new things in the struggle, and our political sense of smell will definitely become more and more sensitive, and all hidden reactionary elements will not want to succeed!

Finally, we ask the government to severely punish Hu Feng, severely punish A Long and other counter-revolutionary elements, and never be lenient!

Letter from all employees of the Capital Construction Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications: After reading the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we have completely recognized the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. It turns out that those dregs of human society, those imperialist Kuomintang secret agents, Trotskyites, renegades, and traitors to the revolution who are deeply hated by the people are the basic backbone of this group. Comrades unanimously angrily denounced the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has always used double-dealing tactics to deceive the people, insidiously and viciously hostile to the people, and opposed the Communist Party. After liberation, they hated the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, hated the people's regime, and everything in the new society even more, and dreamed of the restoration of imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule in China. They believed that the people's revolutionary force under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party was "withered leaves" and "rotten corpses," and cursed the people's force to "be finished." We want to shout loudly to all the Hu Feng elements to let them wake up from their dreams: the power of the people is invincible and will not be overthrown by vicious curses. On the contrary, all counter-revolutionary forces, not only "some fragile buds will be crushed to death," but even those most stubborn and cunning counter-revolutionary forces will surely be uprooted by us. We demand that the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng be severely punished according to law and that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group be resolutely and completely smashed.

From the "People's Daily" editorial and editor's note, we have received very profound education and enlightenment, further recognizing the complexity and acuteness of class struggle during the transition period. Many comrades have criticized muddleheaded ideas such as complacency and carelessness, liberalism, and some "naive" views, and guaranteed to be vigilant at all times, strictly draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, actively participate in the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, and assist the government in resolutely and thoroughly eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionary elements!

Letter from Lin Hanbiao and other six assistant teachers of the Department of Dramatic Literature of the Central Academy of Drama: After reading the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we all felt extremely indignant at the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group! The face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is becoming more and more obvious. Their backbone elements are imperialist Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and renegades. They are Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs left on the mainland to carry out conspiracies and sabotage. They were trained from the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" and "Battle Cadre Fourth Regiment" of the US-Chiang secret service agencies. For many years, they have entered the revolutionary camp to carry out anti-people's criminal activities!

Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary partisans hate the people and hate our new social order. They are constantly conspiring to subvert our people's revolutionary regime! We demand that the People's Government severely suppress the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

Hu Feng and all counter-revolutionary elements want to use the weaknesses of some of us, such as complacency, arrogance, and liberalism, to attack us. After this struggle, we must raise our political awareness, raise our revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements who undermine our cause!

Letter from all comrades of the China Pingju Theater: After reading the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we can no longer suppress our indignation at the crimes of the Hu Feng group. The question of the people's demand to investigate the political background of the Hu Feng group and who Hu Feng's master is has become clear. It turns out that Hu Feng and many backbone elements of the Hu Feng group are imperialist Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and renegades. They have long been loyal running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. They have close ties with imperialist Kuomintang secret service agencies and have long disguised themselves as revolutionaries, hiding inside the people to engage in anti-people's and anti-revolutionary activities. All the comrades in our theater demand that the People's Government immediately punish those diehard backbone elements in the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group according to law and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and completely suppress these reactionary forces.

Through this serious and thrilling political struggle, all the comrades in our theater have greatly improved our political awareness and political sensitivity. We all unanimously stated that we must further learn lessons from the Hu Feng incident, strengthen unity, transform our thinking, strive to study Marxism-Leninism, raise class vigilance, be good at distinguishing all kinds of counter-revolutionary elements, resolutely carry out an irreconcilable struggle against all counter-revolutionary elements, and strive to defend the great socialist construction cause!

    依法惩处胡风和他的一伙反革命分子
    中国人民解放军海军驻京机关部队宣传、文化艺术工作者李君彦、柳夷、郭竟仁等一百九十四人来信：我们怀着无比激愤的心情，一口气读完了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料。我们共同认为这批材料把罪大恶极的胡风及其大小喽啰们的主子给赤裸裸地拖出来了！
    他们的主子是谁？是帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团！他们的“策略”是什么？是一切隐蔽的职业特务们惯用的伎俩！他们的“事业”是什么？是颠覆人民革命政权，使帝国主义和蒋贼的统治在中国复辟！他们中的基本骨干都是些什么东西？是特务，是反动军官、是托洛茨基分子、是革命叛徒、是自首变节分子、是人民的公敌！铁证如山，不容抵赖！
    我们是海军驻北京的机关和部队的宣传、文化艺术工作者，我们的任务是配合各部门和兄弟部队一道解放台湾，保卫我们伟大的祖国。为了这个光荣的任务，我们海军全体指战员紧张地工作着，勇敢地战斗着。有的流过血，有的已经付出了自己宝贵的生命。我们珍惜用血汗换来的胜利成果，不许任何人破坏！但就在我们胜利前进的时候，胡风反革命集团竟在背后偷偷地向革命进攻！这是令人决不能容忍的！我们一致声讨胡风反革命集团！坚决要求依法严惩胡风及其反革命集团的骨干分子！并要求彻底查清他们的全部阴谋活动，把这个罪恶的反革命集团一网打尽！
    中国海员工会机关委员会刘达潮等六十人来信：看了“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”以后，我们更加愤怒了。我们坚决要求彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，把这批反革命分子从人民的队伍中清除出去。我们要求迅速撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会的代表资格，将胡风和胡风反革命集团的首恶分子立即逮捕法办。
    这些天来，通过学习和讨论，大大地提高了我们的政治警惕性。我们保证在中国共产党的领导下，进一步努力学习，提高觉悟，加强革命警觉，防止任何的麻痹大意，彻底粉碎一切暗藏的反革命分子的阴谋活动，并在今后随时随地地、坚持不懈地向一切反革命分子作斗争。中国共产党和毛主席的领导是英明的，全国人民团结的力量是伟大的，任何反革命集团和反革命分子，不管它伪装得怎样巧妙，最后都逃不出全国人民的巨掌，他们必定在全国人民的铁拳捶击下被打得粉碎。我们的事业是正义的，任何敌人也阻挡不住我们向着社会主义、共产主义的道路胜利前进。
    天津市第二建筑工程公司第二工区鞠奇玉、孙宝琦来信：读了六月十日“人民日报”刊载的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，进一步地认清了胡风反革命集团的罪恶本质，我们更无法抑制我们的愤恨。
    几年来由于党的正确领导，各方面的工作都取得了辉煌的成就。我们中国人民都认为生活在今天这样的社会里是值得骄傲的，对建设今后更美好的社会主义社会也有着不可动摇的信心。我们的事业越飞跃地向前发展，人民政权越坚强，人民的敌人也越不甘心。胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动，就是今天阶级斗争更加尖锐化的例证之一。胡风的伎俩是阴狠毒辣的。从第三批材料看，我们更认清了胡风及其集团分子是多年来潜伏在革命阵营中的反革命分子。
    因此，我们要求有关部门根据胡风及其党羽的罪行，依法给以严厉处理。
    北京对外贸易学院全体同学来信：我们对胡风反革命集团表示无比的愤怒。我们学院各班级同学都纷纷集会，一致声讨胡风，一致要求彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团。
    六月十日“人民日报”公布了关于胡风反革命集团第三批材料后，胡风反革命集团的面目就可以看得更清楚了。胡风反革命集团的骨干分子都是帝国主义蒋介石国民党反动派的忠实走狗，他们很早就同国民党特务机关有密切的联系；解放后，他们打着进步的招牌，混进了革命队伍里，继续干他们反党反革命的罪恶勾当。从他们的许多来往信件中可以看出，他们对蒋介石国民党积极拥护，对共产党却有着深仇大恨；对蒋介石国民党的复辟怀着希望，对新中国的一切、对人民革命的胜利则是千方百计地破坏反抗。他们的反革命是有计划、有纲领并且有策略的，和一切特务分子，暗害分子一样，胡风反革命集团是有帝国主义蒋介石反动派作后台的。胡风反革命集团是老早就死心踏地“一不做，二不休”地坚决彻底地反党、反革命、反人民的了。
    现在，胡风反革命集团的真面目，他们的狼心狗肺，已清楚地暴露在人民面前了。他们的反革命罪行必须受到应有的惩处。他们是人民的死敌，是我们青年的死敌，他们在革命队伍里已隐藏二十多年了，过去我们被他们欺骗很久了，我们决不能再容忍下去了。为了保障我们伟大的社会主义建设事业，我们坚决要求依法惩办胡风及其反革命集团的骨干分子，彻底清查胡风反革命集团的罪行，彻底消灭胡风反革命集团。
    中央美术学院学生毕克官、王德娟来信：九日刚给报社寄发了要求惩处胡风的信，十日又见到了关于他们反动罪行的第三批材料，这使得我们更加气愤，我们不能不再一次地要求政府严惩他们！
    新的材料证明了广大群众对他们政治背景的怀疑是正确的。他们中有许多人都有着罪恶的历史，原来阿垅是蒋匪军的“少校”啊！绿原是“中美合作所”的特务啊！而胡风自己则是个革命的叛徒、“反共”的积极分子！
    他们不择手段地打入党内，打入政府机关和人民团体。为了扩大势力、争取人、拉拢人，除了“握手言欢”以外，还“申请”入党哩！他们把入党看成是他们的“斗争”。他们装的多像啊——规规矩矩的，不发牢骚，真是“进步”极了。
    他们同党和人民是势不两立的。看吧！污蔑人民群众跟着伟大的、亲爱的党走是“敬神”，污蔑人民的革命力量是“腐朽的尸体”，是“脓”，难怪反动头目胡风那么坚决地告诉他的喽啰们说：“……割下我的头颅”“抛掷出去”，要把人民的铜墙铁壁“击碎”。这一个反动家伙，他是恨不得死了以后，使自己的尸体仍然能为他们的“事业”效劳。
    但是，我们要大喝一声：“脓”是你们，被“排出”的也是你们，被“击碎”的也是你们，我们同你们势不两立！我们一定要叫你们“完蛋”！
    在斗争中，正如“人民日报”指出的，我们一贯表现的是太天真了。我们的政治嗅觉不灵，以致叫这些反动分子钻了空子。但是我们在斗争中会学会新东西的，我们的政治嗅觉必定会越来越灵，一切暗藏的反动分子休想得逞！
    最后，我们要求政府严惩胡风，严惩阿垅等反革命分子，绝不宽容！
    邮电部基建工程局全体职工来信：读完了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，我们完全认清了胡风反革命集团的真正面目，原来那些人类社会的渣滓，那些为人民深恶痛绝的帝国主义国民党特务分子、托派分子、变节分子、革命叛徒，就是这个集团的基本骨干。同志们一致愤怒地声讨胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动。
    胡风反革命集团一贯用两面派手法蒙骗人民，阴险毒辣地敌视人民，反对共产党。解放后，更加仇视中国人民革命的胜利，仇视人民政权和新社会的一切，梦想帝国主义和国民党反动统治在中国复辟。他们认为在中国共产党领导下的人民革命力量是“枯黄的叶子”“腐朽的尸体”，诅咒人民的力量要“完蛋”。我们要向所有的胡风分子大喝一声，让他们从迷梦中清醒过来：人民的力量是不可战胜的，是不会被恶毒的咒骂所骂倒的，恰恰相反，所有的反革命势力，不仅是“有些脆弱的芽子会被压死的”，就连那些最顽固、最狡猾的反革命势力也一定会被我们连根拔掉的。我们要求依法严厉惩办反革命分子胡风，坚决彻底地粉碎胡风反革命集团。
    从“人民日报”的社论和按语中，我们得到了很深刻的教育和启示，进一步认识了过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性，不少同志批判了麻痹大意、自由主义等糊涂思想和一些“天真”的看法，保证要随时提高警惕，严格划清敌我界限，积极地参加反对胡风反革命集团的斗争，协助政府把一切暗藏的反革命分子坚决地彻底地清除出去！
    中央戏剧学院戏剧文学系助教林汉标等六人来信：看了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料以后，我们对胡风反革命集团的罪行都感到万分的愤慨！胡风反革命集团的面目是愈来愈明显了，他们的骨干分子都是帝国主义国民党特务、反动军官、托洛茨基分子、革命叛徒和自首变节分子，他们是国民党蒋介石匪帮留在大陆进行阴谋破坏的特务匪徒，是从美蒋特务机关“中美合作所”、“战干四团”等训练出来的。多年来，他们打进革命阵营进行着反人民的罪恶活动！
    胡风及其反革命党羽是痛恨人民，痛恨我们新的社会秩序的。他们时刻阴谋从事颠覆我们人民革命政权的活动！我们要求人民政府严厉镇压胡风反革命集团。
    胡风及一切反革命分子是要利用我们某些人的麻痹大意、骄傲自满、自由主义等弱点来向我们进攻的。经过这一次斗争，我们一定要提高政治觉悟，提高革命警惕，坚决将一切破坏我们事业的反革命分子消灭干净！
    中国评剧院全体同志来信：读了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，我们更无法抑制我们对胡风集团的罪行的愤慨了。人们要求追查胡风集团的政治背景和胡风的主子究竟是谁的问题，已经是一清二楚了。原来胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子，就是帝国主义国民党特务分子，反动军官，托洛茨基分子，革命叛徒，自首变节分子。他们很早以来就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，他们同帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切的联系，长期地伪装革命，暗藏在人民的内部来干着反人民反革命的勾当的。我们全院同志要求人民政府对胡风反革命集团中那些死不觉悟的骨干分子，立即依法惩办，把这些反动势力坚决、彻底、干尽、全部地镇压下去。
    我们全院的同志们，通过这一次严重的、惊心动魄的政治斗争，大大地提高了我们的政治觉悟和政治敏感。我们大家一致表示，必须从胡风事件进一步吸取教训，必须加强团结，改造思想，努力学习马克思列宁主义，提高阶级警觉，要善于辨别各式各样的反革命分子，坚决同一切反革命分子进行不调和的斗争，为保卫伟大的社会主义建设事业而奋斗！
