The Chinese people warmly welcome and support the declaration of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments. The publication of this declaration is a major event in current international relations. The declaration embodies the sincere desire of the fraternal peoples of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia to strengthen all-round cooperation with each other, and is a major contribution to creating an atmosphere of international trust and strengthening world peace. It marks a victory for the cause of peace won by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. This is a major achievement of the Soviet Union's consistent policy of handling international relations in accordance with the principles of respect for territorial sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit, and strengthening international cooperation and friendship among all peoples on this basis. At the same time, it is also a concrete manifestation of the Yugoslav government's active promotion of peace and international cooperation.

The normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is in the common interests of the two peoples. The two peoples have had a traditional brotherly friendship for centuries. In the anti-fascist Second World War, the two peoples fought side by side, jointly fought the enemy, and shed blood together. It was precisely because of the joint struggle of the Yugoslav and Soviet peoples that Yugoslavia gained independence and liberation in the anti-fascist war. In recent years, the good relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have been damaged, but this situation has passed. The talks between the government delegations of the two countries, held in a spirit of friendship, eliminated all obstacles to the complete normalization of relations between the two countries, and laid a solid and sound foundation for expanding and consolidating the brotherly friendship between the two peoples.

The peoples of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia share the same ideals in the struggle for human peace, prosperity and happiness. They have a common need to strengthen world peace, and the two peoples have a common fundamental interest - the interest of the international workers' movement. Therefore, the complete normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and the strengthening and consolidation of the friendship between the two peoples are of great significance to world peace, the interests of socialism, and the unity and development of the international working class movement.

The declaration of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments affirms the consistency of the two countries in dealing with major principles of international affairs. These principles are all aimed at striving to ease international tensions and consolidate peace. The two governments believe that efforts should be made to seek positive results and agreements through negotiations on issues such as disarmament and arms limitation, as well as the prohibition of atomic weapons, the establishment of a universal collective security, including a European collective security system based on treaties, and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The two governments believe that through such efforts, an atmosphere should be created so that urgent international issues such as the German question can be resolved in accordance with the wishes and interests of the German people and the interests of universal security, with the agreement of all parties. Undoubtedly, the resolution of these issues will greatly ease international tensions and establish international mutual trust and cooperation. In particular, if a European collective security system including all European countries, large and small, can be established, it can eliminate the hostile and tense situation created in Europe by the rearmament of West Germany, and it will be conducive to the settlement of the German question. Now more and more people are supporting this proposition.

The two governments advocate satisfying the legitimate demands of the People's Republic of China for Taiwan and restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. This is in line with the desire of the world's peace-loving people to ease tensions in the Far East; it is an important support for the Chinese people. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a just action by the Chinese people to safeguard their country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This struggle is gaining the sympathy and support of an increasing number of countries and peoples.

The support of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia for the results of the Bandung Conference once again proves that the Bandung Conference is playing a huge role in promoting peace around the world.

The development of Soviet-Yugoslav relations is a major process in seeking to strengthen the cause of peace and is entirely beneficial to the people of all countries. However, the enemies of peace have expressed extraordinary dissatisfaction with this. Starting from the position of creating division and hostility, they are very reluctant to see the creation of trust in international relations and the signs of peaceful cooperation. They tried their best to belittle the significance of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks, and cursed the Soviet Union and the talks with all sorts of vile tones. The American "New York Times" even advised the Yugoslav leaders not to agree to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union under any circumstances. During the talks, they tried to put pressure on the talks through various despicable channels. But the US ruling group's hope of continuing to create divisions and hostility in Soviet-Yugoslav relations has failed. The brotherly friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia constitutes the basis for the normalization of relations between the two countries. In the declaration, the two governments expressed that in order to further develop mutual understanding between the two countries, to develop international cooperation and to consolidate world peace, they will make the greatest efforts to realize the tasks and decisions stipulated in the declaration of the two governments.

The Chinese people have always deeply admired the Yugoslav people for their heroic and unyielding struggle in the anti-fascist war. We know that the Yugoslav people love peace and have made continuous efforts to strive for peace. Recently, China and Yugoslavia have established diplomatic relations. We are willing to further develop friendly cooperation between China and Yugoslavia. We firmly believe that the improvement of relations between China and Yugoslavia will be conducive to promoting the interests of the two peoples and world peace.

All peace-loving people and those who are truly concerned about the cause of socialism and the international workers' movement sincerely welcome the achievements of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks. The result of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks has a positive impact on the international situation. It has increased mutual understanding between countries and created an atmosphere of mutual trust between countries. The further development and consolidation of relations between the two countries is an important factor in strengthening peace in Europe and the world. There is no doubt that this is in line with the true interests of the two peoples, hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, and the international working class.

### 国际关系中的一个重大事件

    国际关系中的一个重大事件
    中国人民热烈欢迎和支持苏联和南斯拉夫两国政府宣言。这个宣言的发表是目前国际关系中的一个重大事件。宣言体现了苏南两国兄弟般的人民要求加强相互之间的全面合作的真诚愿望，对创造国际信任空气加强世界和平是一个重大的贡献。它标志着苏南两国为和平事业赢得的一个胜利。这是苏联一贯依照尊重领土主权和平等互利的原则来处理国际关系，并在这个基础上加强国际合作和各国人民友好政策的重大成果，同时这也是南斯拉夫政府积极促进和平和国际合作的具体表现。
    苏南两国关系的正常化，是符合于两国人民的共同利益的。两国人民在若干世纪以来就有着传统的兄弟友谊。在反法西斯的第二次世界大战中两国人民曾并肩作战，共同打击敌人，鲜血流在一起。正是由于南斯拉夫人民和苏联人民的联合斗争，南斯拉夫在反法西斯的战争中获得了独立和解放。近年来苏南两国的良好关系曾遭到了损害，但这种情况已经过去了。本着友好精神举行的两国政府代表团的会谈，消除了妨碍两国关系完全正常化的一切障碍，并为扩大和巩固两国人民的兄弟友谊奠定了坚定的和健全的基础。
    苏南两国人民在争取人类和平、繁荣和幸福的斗争中怀着一致的理想，他们有着为加强世界和平而斗争的共同需要，两国人民有着共同的根本利益——国际工人运动的利益。因而，苏南两国关系的完全正常化和两国人民友谊的加强和巩固，对于世界和平、社会主义利益和国际工人阶级运动的团结和发展都具有十分重大的意义。
    苏南两国政府宣言确定了两国在处理国际事务的重大原则方面的一致性。这些原则都指向着争取缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平。两国政府认为应当争取在裁减和限制军备以及禁止原子武器、建立普遍的集体安全，其中包括以条约为基础的欧洲集体安全体系，以及原子能用于和平目的这一类问题上，通过谈判来求得积极的结果和协议。两国政府认为要经过这种努力，创造气氛，使像德国问题这样迫切的国际问题得以按照德国人民的愿望和利益和普遍安全的利益取得各方都同意的解决。无疑地，这些问题的解决，将大大缓和国际紧张局势，并建立起国际间的互信和合作。特别是如果包括欧洲一切大小国家在内的欧洲集体安全体系能够建立起来，就可以消除由于重新武装西德而在欧洲造成的敌对和紧张形势，并有利于德国问题的解决。现在支持这种主张的人是越来越多了。
    两国政府主张满足中华人民共和国对台湾的合法权利的要求，主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。这是符合于世界爱好和平人民缓和远东紧张局势的愿望的；是对中国人民的重要支持。中国人民解放台湾的斗争，是中国人民为保障自己祖国的主权和领土完整的正义行动。这个斗争正在获得日益众多的国家和人民的同情和支持。
    苏南两国支持万隆会议的结果又一次证明了万隆会议正在全世界起着促进和平的巨大影响。
    苏南关系的发展，是谋求加强和平事业的重大进程，对各国人民是完全有利的。但是，和平的敌人却对此表示异常不满。他们从制造分裂和敌对的立场出发，十分不愿看到在国际关系中创造信任，不愿看到和平合作的迹象。他们极力贬低苏南会谈的意义，用种种卑劣腔调诅咒苏联，诅咒这次会谈。美国“纽约时报”甚至劝告南斯拉夫领袖无论如何不要同意同苏联建立友好关系。在会谈进行中，他们经过各种人所不齿的途径，企图对会谈施加压力。但是美国统治集团企图继续在苏南关系上制造分歧和敌对的希望落空了。苏南两国人民兄弟般的友谊构成了两国关系的正常化的基础。两国政府在宣言中表示，为了进一步发展两国之间的相互了解，为了发展国际合作和巩固世界和平，将尽最大努力来实现两国政府宣言所规定的任务和决定。
    中国人民对于南斯拉夫人民为在反法西斯战争中所进行的英勇不屈的斗争一向是深为敬佩的。我们深知南斯拉夫人民热爱和平，并为争取和平进行了不断的努力。最近，中南两国已建立了外交关系。我们愿意进一步发展中南两国间的友好合作。我们深信中南两国关系的增进必将有利于促进两国人民和世界和平的利益。
    全世界爱好和平和真正关心社会主义事业和国际工人运动的人，都衷心欢迎苏南会谈的成就。苏南会谈的结果，对国际局势产生着有利的影响，它增加了国家间的互相谅解，创造了国家间互相信任的气氛。两国关系的进一步发展和巩固是加强欧洲和世界和平的重要因素。毫无疑问，这是符合于两国人民、全世界亿万爱好和平人民和国际工人阶级的真正利益的。
