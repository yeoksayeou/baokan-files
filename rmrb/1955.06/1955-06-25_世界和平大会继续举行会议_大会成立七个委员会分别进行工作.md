Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, June 24th -- According to TASS, Helsinki, June 24th: The World Peace Congress continued its meeting on the 23rd. The morning session was chaired by Brazilian writer José Castro.

Castro said that on the evening of the 22nd, the Presidium of the Congress held a meeting, at which the Executive Committee was elected. Thirty-three people were elected as executive members, including Joliot-Curie, Dastier de la Vigerie, Serenyi, Professor Bernal, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Gao Shushen, Zok, Gruber, Pastor Fobeck, Ehrenburg, Korneichuk, D'Abosse, and Sayan.

At the Presidium meeting, Edouard Herriot was elected Honorary President of the Congress.

The chairman of the meeting announced that, in addition to the plenary session, the Congress had also established seven committees to carry out work: three general committees (Committee on Disarmament and Atomic Weapons, Committee on Military Blocs and Security, Committee on National Sovereignty and Peace) and four specialized committees (Committee on Economic and Social Issues, Committee on Cultural Exchange, Committee on Youth Issues, Committee on Activities of Peace Forces).

At the plenary session of the Congress on the 23rd, Canadian pastor Candy, representing the "Peace Mission" organization in Toronto, spoke first. His speech proved that the proposition that peace must be defended has spread to the broadest strata of residents. Candy did not hide the fact that he was close to the views of those who, influenced by reactionary propaganda, held distrustful attitudes towards the peace movement. He said that he came to the Congress to see people from various countries with his own eyes and listen to their opinions. He said that efforts must be made to eliminate the atmosphere of distrust and suspicion among the people of various countries. Candy called for the abandonment of hate propaganda.

Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council and Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, then spoke. (See page two of today's newspaper) His speech was warmly welcomed by the audience.

The Congress warmly welcomed the speech of Gao Shushen, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council. Gao Shushen said that our consistent demand is to get rid of colonialism and that all people of all countries are equal regardless of their skin color. Our main purpose is peaceful coexistence. In analyzing the current international situation, Gao Shushen emphasized that some sovereign countries are now facing the danger of losing their independence and sovereignty due to foreign aggression. This aggression is currently usually carried out in various disguised ways, such as describing the establishment of military bases as defense. Especially insidious is the economic oppression under the guise of "economic assistance."

Speaking of the situation in Japan, Gao Shushen pointed out that the United States is occupying Japan under another guise. He said that someone is obstructing Japan from establishing good mutual relations with its neighbors, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, which is a threat to peace. Japan must get rid of this nightmare. All American troops and aircraft should be withdrawn immediately from Okinawa and other Japanese islands.

Gao Shushen then talked about the situation in the Taiwan area. He said that a small group of fugitives entrenched on this island is recognized by the United States and its vassal states as the "government of China," and it is on this basis that China's legitimate seat in the United Nations is deprived. Taiwan has become a base for attacking China and is used to carry out piratical attacks on foreign ships. This island is a source of great threat to the cause of peace in Asia. We firmly demand that the Americans leave Taiwan and other Chinese islands immediately and let China solve its own internal problems.

When talking about the situation in colonial countries, Gao Shushen pointed out that in Tunisia, Morocco, Malaya, and Kenya, the people of these countries are trying to get rid of foreign rule and seek independence.

Gao Shushen then mentioned the five principles of peaceful coexistence and pointed out the initiative shown by India.

The next speaker was Mrs. Lay, a representative from New Zealand. She called for peaceful coexistence between all countries, large and small, in Asia. She pointed out that the US war preparations in the Far East, including measures to turn Taiwan into a US military base, are a threat to New Zealand. Mrs. Lay finally called for intensifying the struggle for peace.

Professor Yasui Iku, Secretary-General of the Japan National Council for the Signature Movement Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, spoke. He suggested that August 6th, the day ten years ago when the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, be designated as the day against preparing for atomic war. He gave a detailed introduction to the Japanese people's struggle to ban atomic weapons.

Prit, President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers (British), pointed out that the main purpose of this conference is to ban and destroy thermonuclear weapons. He said that from the perspective of international law, atomic weapons that threaten peaceful residents are illegal. The decision to use atomic weapons is a crime against peace.

The morning meeting ended here.
Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, June 24th -- TASS, Helsinki, June 24th: The committees of the World Peace Congress will begin their work on the 24th. These committees are: the Committee on Disarmament and Atomic Weapons, the Committee on Military Blocs and Security, the Committee on National Sovereignty and Peace, and other committees.

    世界和平大会继续举行会议
    大会成立七个委员会分别进行工作
    新华社二十四日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基二十四日讯：世界和平大会二十三日继续开会。上午会议由巴西作家若泽·卡斯特罗担任主席。
    卡斯特罗说，二十二日晚间，大会主席团举行了会议，会上选出了执行委员会。三十三人当选为执行委员，其中有约里奥—居里、达斯迪埃·德拉维热里、塞伦尼、贝尔纳教授、郭沫若、茅盾、高善必、索克、格鲁柏、福贝克牧师、爱伦堡、考涅楚克、达波赛、赛扬。
    在主席团会议上选出了爱德华·赫里欧为大会名誉主席。
    会议主席宣布，除全体会议之外，大会还成立了七个委员会进行工作：三个一般委员会（裁减军备和原子武器问题委员会，军事集团和安全问题委员会，民族主权和和平问题委员会）和四个专门委员会（经济和社会问题委员会，文化交流委员会，青年问题委员会，和平力量活动问题委员会）。
    在二十三日大会的全体会议上，代表多伦多市“和平布道会”组织的加拿大牧师坎迪首先发言。他的讲话证明，必须保卫和平的主张已传播到各个最广泛的居民阶层中。坎迪没有掩饰他是接近那些受到反动宣传的影响而对和平运动抱着不信任态度的人们的观点的。他说，他来参加大会是为了亲眼看看来自各国的人们，并且听听他们的意见。他说，必须力求消除各国人民间的不信任和猜疑的气氛。坎迪呼吁放弃仇恨宣传。
    世界和平理事会副主席、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若接着发言。（见今天本报第二版）他的发言受到全场热烈的欢迎。
    大会热烈欢迎全印和平理事会副主席高善必的发言。高善必说，我们的一贯要求是，摆脱殖民主义、各国人民不问其肤色的不同，一律平等。我们的主要目的就是和平共处。高善必在分析目前的国际局势时着重指出，一些主权国家由于受到外国侵略，现在面临着丧失自己的独立和主权的危险，这种侵略目前通常采用各种掩盖的方式，例如，把建立军事基地说成防御。尤其险恶的是，以“经济援助”为幌子的经济压迫。
    高善必谈到日本局势时指出，美国是在另外的幌子下占领日本的。他说，有人阻挠日本同邻邦苏联和中华人民共和国建立良好的相互关系，这是对和平的一个威胁。日本必须摆脱这个梦魇。美国所有军队和飞机应该立即撤出冲绳岛和日本的其他岛屿。
    高善必接着谈到台湾地区局势问题。他说，盘踞在这个岛屿的一小撮逃亡集团被美国和它的仆从国承认为“中国政府”，而且就根据这一理由，中国在联合国中的合法席位被剥夺了。台湾成了进攻中国的基地，并且被用来对外国船只进行海盗式的袭击。这个岛屿是对亚洲和平事业的巨大威胁的策源地。我们坚决要求，美国人立即离开台湾和中国的其他岛屿，让中国自己解决自己的内部问题。
    高善必在谈到殖民地国家的情况时指出，在突尼斯、摩洛哥、马来亚、怯尼亚，这些国家的人民力图摆脱外国的统治而求得独立。
    高善必接着提到和平共处的五项原则，并且指出印度所表现的主动性。
    接着发言的是新西兰代表莱伊夫人。她呼吁亚洲一切大小国家和平共处。她指出，美国在远东的战争准备，包括把台湾变为美国军事基地的措施是对新西兰的威胁。莱伊夫人最后呼吁加紧争取和平的斗争。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹签名运动全国协议会事务局长安井郁教授发言。他建议把八月六日这一天，即十年前美国在广岛和长崎投下了头几枚原子弹的日子定为反对准备原子战争日。他详细介绍了日本人民争取禁止原子武器的斗争情况。
    国际民主法律工作者协会主席普里特（英国）发言时指出，这次大会的主要目的是禁止和销毁热核子武器。他说，从国际法观点来看，威胁到和平居民的原子武器是非法的。使用原子武器的决定是一种反对和平的罪行。
    上午会议至此结束。
  新华社二十四日讯　塔斯社赫尔辛基二十四日讯：世界和平大会各委员会从二十四日起进行工作。这些委员会是：裁减军备和原子武器问题委员会、军事集团和安全问题委员会、民族主权和和平问题委员会及其他委员会。
