Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 7th. Indian Prime Minister Nehru answered questions from reporters at a press conference held at the Indian Embassy on the evening of the 6th.

When talking about his meeting with Prime Minister Široký, Nehru said, "We discussed economic issues. I tried to understand the economic situation in Czechoslovakia, and I found it very helpful to understand this situation."

Prime Minister Nehru continued, saying that he believed that "developing cultural and economic relations between the two countries is a good thing."

When asked about his trip to the Soviet Union, Nehru said: "This was a friendly visit. There are no problems to be resolved between the Soviet Union and India. Of course, since I am going there, we will talk about many things."

When a reporter asked him about the People's Republic of China's seat in the United Nations, he said: "For various reasons, we have always been very much in favor of the People's Government of China entering the United Nations. At present, People's China is not represented in the United Nations. It is completely wrong for Taiwan to represent China."
