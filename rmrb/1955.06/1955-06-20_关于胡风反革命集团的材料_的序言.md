To meet the needs of the broad readership, we are now compiling the three batches of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the "People's Daily" from May 13 to June 10, 1955, and the "People's Daily" editorial of June 10, 1955, and handing them over to the People's Publishing House for publication under the title "Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique." In this book, we have still printed Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" as a reference for readers to study this counter-revolutionary double-dealer, but it has been changed to an appendix and printed after Shu Wu's "Material." We have made minor textual revisions to the editor's notes and annotations on the three "Materials." We have modified some annotations and added some annotations in the second "Material," and also added two editor's notes. The words "Anti-Party Clique" in the titles of the first and second "Materials" are uniformly changed to "Counter-Revolutionary Clique," like the third, to unify them. Otherwise, everything remains the same.

It is estimated that the publication of this book, like the publication of these materials in the "People's Daily," will be noticed by people on two sides. On the one hand, counter-revolutionaries will pay attention to it. On the other hand, the broad masses of the people will pay even more attention.

Counter-revolutionaries and people with certain counter-revolutionary sentiments will find resonance in the correspondence of the Hu Feng elements. Hu Feng and the Hu Feng elements are indeed the spokesmen of all counter-revolutionary classes, groups, and individuals. Their curses against the revolution and their activity strategies will be appreciated by all counter-revolutionaries who can obtain this book, and they will receive some counter-revolutionary class struggle education from it. But no matter what, it will not save them from their doom. These documents of the Hu Feng elements, like all the anti-China people's counter-revolutionary documents of their backers, the imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, are not records of success, but only records of failure; they did not save their own clique from destruction.

The broad masses of the people are in great need of such material. How do counter-revolutionaries play double-dealing tricks? How do they deceive us with false appearances, while secretly doing things we do not expect? Tens of thousands of good people do not know these things. Precisely because of this, many counter-revolutionaries have sneaked into our ranks. Our people's eyes are not bright, and they are not good at distinguishing between good and bad people. We are good at distinguishing between good and bad people who engage in activities under normal circumstances, but we are not good at distinguishing between certain people who engage in activities under special circumstances. The Hu Feng elements are counter-revolutionaries who appear in disguise; they give people false impressions while concealing the truth. But since they want to be counter-revolutionary, they cannot conceal their true colors completely. As representatives of a group, they have had many disputes with us before and after liberation. Their words and actions are not only different from those of Communists, but also different from those of the broad masses of non-Party revolutionaries and democratic figures. The recent great exposure is only the result of seizing a large amount of their concrete evidence. As for many individual members of the Hu Feng elements, the reason why we were deceived by them is that our Party organizations, state organs, people's organizations, cultural and educational institutions, or enterprises lacked strict examination when they accepted them. It is also because we were in a period of great revolutionary storms in the past, and we were the victors, so all kinds of people flocked to us, inevitably bringing in the bad with the good, and we have not yet had time to carry out a thorough cleaning. It is also because distinguishing and cleaning out bad people requires the correct guidance of the leading organs and the high level of awareness of the broad masses of the people, and our work in this area has had shortcomings in the past. All of these are lessons.

The reason why we attach importance to the Hu Feng incident is to use this incident to educate the broad masses of the people, especially the working cadres and intellectuals who have the ability to read, and to recommend this "Material" to them in order to raise their level of awareness. This "Material" has extreme sharpness and clarity, and it is very attention-grabbing. Counter-revolutionaries certainly pay attention to it, and revolutionary people pay even more attention to it. As long as the broad revolutionary people learn something from this incident and material, arouse revolutionary enthusiasm, and improve their ability to distinguish, all kinds of hidden counter-revolutionaries will be cleared out by us step by step.

### “关于胡风反革命集团的材料”的序言

    “关于胡风反革命集团的材料”的序言
    为应广大读者的需要，我们现在将“人民日报”在一九五五年五月十三日至六月十日期间所发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料和“人民日报”一九五五年六月十日的社论编在一起，交人民出版社出版，书名就叫“关于胡风反革命集团的材料”。在这本书中，我们仍然印了胡风的“我的自我批判”一文，作为读者研究这个反革命两面派的一项资料，不过把它改为附件，印在舒芜那篇“材料”的后面。我们对三篇“材料”的按语和注文，作了少数文字上的修改。我们在第二篇“材料”中修改了一些注文，增加了一些注文，又增加了两个按语。第一、第二两篇题目中的“反党集团”字样，统照第三篇那样，改为“反革命集团”，以归一律。此外，一切照旧。
    估计到本书的出版，如同“人民日报”发表这些材料一样，将为两方面的人们所注意。一方面，反革命分子将注意它。一方面，广大人民将更加注意。
    反革命分子和有某些反革命情绪的人们，将从胡风分子的那些通信中得到共鸣。胡风和胡风分子确是一切反革命阶级、集团和个人的代言人，他们咒骂革命的话和他们的活动策略，将为一切能得到这本书的反革命分子所欣赏，并从这里得到某些反革命的阶级斗争的教育。但是不论怎么样，总是无救于他们的灭亡的。胡风分子的这些文件，如同他们的靠山帝国主义和蒋介石国民党一切反对中国人民的反革命文件一样，并不是成功的纪录，而只是失败的纪录，他们没有挽救他们自己集团的灭亡。
    广大人民群众很需要这样一部材料。反革命分子怎样耍两面派手法呢？他们怎样以假象欺骗我们，而在暗里却干着我们意料不到的事情呢？这一切，成千成万的善良人是不知道的。就是因为这个原故，许多反革命分子钻进我们的队伍中来了。我们的人眼睛不亮，不善于辨别好人和坏人。我们善于辨别在正常情况之下从事活动的好人和坏人，但是我们不善于辨别在特殊情况下从事活动的某些人们。胡风分子是以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。作为一个集团的代表人物，在解放以前和解放以后，他们和我们的争论已有多次了。他们的言论、行动，不但跟共产党人不相同，跟广大的党外革命者和民主人士也是不相同的。最近的大暴露，不过是抓住了他们的大批真凭实据而已。就胡风分子的许多个别的人来说，我们所以受他们欺骗，则是因为我们的党组织，国家机关，人民团体，文化教育机关，或企业机关，当着接收他们的时候，缺乏严格的审查。也因为我们过去是处在革命的大风暴时期，我们是胜利者，各种人都向我们靠拢，未免泥沙俱下，鱼龙混杂，我们还没有来得及作一次彻底的清理。还因为辨别和清理坏人这件事，是要依靠领导机关的正确指导和广大群众的高度觉悟相结合才能办到，而我们过去在这方面的工作是有缺点的。凡此种种，都是教训。
    我们所以重视胡风事件，就是要用这个事件向广大人民群众，首先是向具有阅读能力的工作干部和知识分子进行教育，向他们推荐这个“材料”，借以提高他们的觉悟程度。这个“材料”具有极大的尖锐性和鲜明性，十分引人注意。反革命分子固然注意它，革命人民尤其注意它。只要广大的革命人民从这个事件和材料学得了一些东西，激发了革命热情，提高了辨别能力，各种暗藏的反革命分子就会被我们一步一步地清查出来的。
