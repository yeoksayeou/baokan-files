Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: New York dispatch: The "New York Times" published a dispatch from Taipei revealing that the United States has turned Taiwan into a forward air base aimed at the Chinese people.

The dispatch said that Taiwan has become an important U.S. air base. On the west coast of Taiwan, there are at least five airports (Taichung, Chiayi, Taoyuan, Pingtung, Tainan) that can be used by American pilots to carry out "defensive" and offensive flights from there in the event of any "emergency." In addition, the United States has also equipped a number of smaller airports to ensure full logistical and flight support for American aircraft.

The dispatch believes that the fact that Davis, Deputy Commander of the U.S. 13th Air Force, has come to Taiwan to head the Air Force's task force headquarters in Taipei shows that the U.S. Air Force attaches great importance to Taiwan and regards it as a potential center for air force activities.

    美国已把台湾变成空军基地
    新华社十三日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”刊登的台北消息透露，美国已经把台湾变成针对中国人民的空军前进基地。
    消息说，台湾已经成了一个重要的美国空军基地。在台湾的西海岸上至少有五个机场（台中、嘉义、桃园、屏东、台南）可以供美国驾驶员在发生任何“紧急情况”时从那里进行“防御”和进攻飞行。此外，美国还装备了若干较小的机场来保证给美国飞机以充分的后勤和飞行支援。
    消息认为，美国第十三航空队副司令戴维斯到台湾担任这个航空队设在台北的特遣总部一事，说明美国空军非常重视台湾，把它看作是一个空军活动的潜在中心。
