Xinhua News Agency, June 27th. Today, the distinguished guests of the Indian cultural delegation and more than 12,000 people from all walks of life in the capital spent a pleasant summer evening in Zhongshan Park.

Colored lights stretched out in all directions in the sky above the Altar of Land and Grain, and the large and small palace lanterns hanging on the trellises and evergreen ancient cypresses, and the colorful bead crowns on the pavilions and corridors, shone together. Various flowers exuded a unique fragrance, and countless dance circles floated with lively and melodious dances and songs. In Zhongshan Hall, more than a dozen young actors from "Flowers of the Motherland" met with the Indian artists here. The Indian artists watched this movie last night, and they scrambled to talk to the young actors.

At 9:10, delegation leader Chanda, Mrs. Chanda, and all the members of the delegation, accompanied by Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, walked out of Zhongshan Hall to participate in the park tour. Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, Deputy Foreign Ministers Zhang Wentian and Zhang Hanfu, Acting Minister of Culture Qian Junrui, and Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen also participated in the garden party. In front of Zhongshan Hall, the tourists were in high spirits for dancing, and the distinguished guests passed through the crowd of people who cheered them.

The distinguished guests of the Indian cultural delegation sat on the ground in front of Zhongshan Hall and watched the children's theater troupe perform "Playing the Saucer." The distinguished guests then went to the Western Forest to enjoy the Xinjiang dance music - "Beautiful Motherland". The flower sticks, diabolo, and rope skills performed by the China Acrobatic Troupe aroused their great interest. Accompanied by the singing of the national instrumental ensemble, the representatives passed through the tree-lined road. Ms. Shirin Vajifdar and Mr. Krishna Kutti stepped into the dance circle and danced with everyone. Under the wisteria trees, the distinguished guests were attracted by the acting skills of the puppet show. When the puppet Yangko dance was over, the excellent Indian singer Debabrata Biswas shouted in Chinese: "One more!" Delegation leader Chanda, Mrs. Chanda and many members went backstage to watch the puppet actors perform. The distinguished guests finally watched the "Lion Dance", and they repeatedly exclaimed "Wonderful, wonderful!" and thanked the actors.

When the Indian cultural delegation passed through the last gathering place, they shook hands with the people in the park to say goodbye.

    印度艺术家们同首都各界人民游园
    新华社二十七日讯今天，印度文化代表团的贵宾们和首都各界一万二千多人，在中山公园里度过了一个愉快的夏天夜晚。
    在社稷坛上空向四周伸展着的各色彩灯和悬挂在藤架上、长青古柏上的大小宫灯和亭榭、长廊上的彩色珠冠交相辉映。各色鲜花吐露出异香，无数舞圈飘扬出轻快悦耳的舞曲和歌声。在中山堂，“祖国的花朵”中的十多个小演员，在这里和印度的艺术家会见了。印度的艺术家们在昨天夜里看过这个电影，他们争着和小演员们交谈。
    九时零十分，钱达团长、钱达夫人和全体团员带着小演员们由中印友好协会会长丁西林陪同走出了中山堂参加了游园，国务院副总理陈毅、外交部副部长张闻天、章汉夫、文化部代理部长钱俊瑞、北京市市长彭真也参加了游园会。中山堂前游人舞兴正浓，贵宾们穿过了夹道欢呼的人群。
    印度文化代表团的贵宾们在中山堂前席地而坐，观看了少年儿童剧团表演的“打盅盘”。贵宾们又到西树林里欣赏了新疆舞曲——“美丽的祖国”。由中国杂技团表演的花棍、空竹和绳技，引起他们极大的兴趣。伴随着民族器乐合奏曲的歌声，代表们穿过林荫道。希林·瓦吉弗达尔女士和克里希纳·库蒂先生走入舞圈和大家跳起舞来。在藤萝树下，贵宾们为木偶戏的演技吸引住了。当木偶秧歌舞演完时，印度优秀的歌唱家德巴布拉塔·毕斯瓦斯用中国话连呼：“再来一个”！钱达团长、钱达夫人和许多团员走到后台，看木偶演员表演木偶的情景。贵宾们最后观看了“狮子舞”，他们连呼“精采，精采”！并向演员们致谢。
    印度文化代表团一行在走过最后一段人群聚集的场所时，他们向游园的人们握手告别。
