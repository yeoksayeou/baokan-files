Correctly Treat Members' Sideline Activities
Ai Fang

In addition to agricultural production, farmers also engage in a variety of sideline activities. Most of these activities are carried out during the agricultural off-season and are a significant source of income for farmers. In particular, sideline income accounts for a larger proportion of the income of poor farmers with less land. After the establishment of the cooperatives, the original experience of the members should be used to appropriately organize the sideline production of the cooperative according to the local conditions at the time; and to support many individual sideline activities of the members without affecting the production of the cooperative.

In Wu Gong County, Shanxi Province, many agricultural cooperatives and local leaders who established the cooperatives unreasonably restricted the sideline production of the members and did not allow them to carry out such activities. Pangjiabaozi Village in the Eighth District of the county is a village with less land and more sideline activities. The village has a total of fifty-four households. In previous years, during the gaps in production in the spring, seven carts and more than twenty vegetable carriers went out to transport grain for the state and the cooperative, or to sell vegetables in the market. The income from these activities greatly helped to solve the problem of farmers' livelihood difficulties in the spring. Since the establishment of the cooperative last winter, after everyone joined the cooperative, more than twenty vegetable carriers stopped working due to the interference of the agricultural cooperative and the local leaders who established the cooperative (only three or four members had tried to go out a few times), but the labor force was idle and there was not much to do. This spring, the cooperative has not sent out vehicles for a long time to transport grain for the state or carry out other similar activities, and many vehicles and livestock have been idle for a long time, resulting in a great waste of manpower and animal power and reducing the income of the cooperative and its members. The members criticized the staff's approach as asking everyone to "sit and eat" and "eat for nothing." This is one of the reasons why many members of the cooperative (including many poor farmers) withdrew from the cooperative. Some cooperatives in the Third and Seventh Districts of the county stipulate that when members go out to do short-term work or engage in other sideline activities during the agricultural off-season, the cooperative will manage and operate them in a unified manner. Members engaged in sideline activities have to hand over most of their daily labor income to the cooperative, and the cooperative only records two and a half to three work points. In this way, it is difficult to solve the problem of these members' livelihood difficulties.

These phenomena show that some leaders of agricultural cooperatives have not well integrated the sideline activities of the cooperative and the individual members with the production of the cooperative, nor have they well integrated the current and long-term interests of the members ideologically and practically. Some criticize the members' sideline activities as "grabbing ready-made things" in general, without asking whether this "grabbing ready-made things" hinders agricultural production. Some overemphasize that the members' original sideline activities should be collectively operated by the cooperative after joining the cooperative, without seriously considering whether these sideline activities are suitable for collective operation; even if they are suitable, whether they have the conditions for collective operation.

The fundamental purpose of establishing cooperatives is to increase agricultural production, and the main source of income for members is also here. There is great potential in this regard, and we should think of more ways to do this in the future, which is certain. Members' sideline activities should not hinder agricultural production. However, leaders of agricultural cooperatives must also pay attention to giving full play to the role of the cooperative and the members' various sideline activities. Efforts must be made in all aspects to ensure that members' income increases. Increasing sideline income can also increase investment in agricultural production, which is also helpful to agricultural production.

    正确对待社员的副业活动
    艾方
    农民们除了农业生产以外，还有多种多样的副业活动。这些活动大多是利用农闲进行的，是农民们的一个相当重要的收入来源。特别是土地较少的贫苦农民，副业收入在他们的收入中占有更大的比重。建社以后，应该利用社员们原有的经验，按照当时当地的条件，适当组织社里的副业生产；并在不影响社里生产的情况下，支持社员个人的许多副业活动。
    陕西武功县有许多农业合作社和当地领导建社的工作人员，对社员的若干副业生产，却无理加以限制，不准社员进行。该县八区庞家堡子村，是土地较少、副业活动较多的一个村子。全村五十四户。往年春天，在生产空隙有七辆大车、二十多付菜担外出，给国家和合作社运输粮食，或在市场上贩运青菜。这些活动的收入，对于解决农民春季生活困难的问题有很大帮助。自从去年冬天建社，大家入社以后，二十多付菜担子因为农业合作社和当地领导建社的工作人员的干涉，都歇下来了（只有三几个社员曾经争取出去过几次），劳力却闲下来没有多少事做。今年春天，社里长期没有出车为国家运输粮食，或进行其他类似的活动，许多车辆、牲口却有大段时间的空闲，形成人力畜力很大浪费，减少了社和社员的收入。社员们批评工作人员的这种做法是要大家“坐吃”和“吃空”。这是这个社有许多社员退社（其中包括许多贫农社员在内）的原因之一。该县第三区、第七区有些社，规定社员在农闲的时候外出做短工或进行其他副业，由社统一管理经营。从事副业活动的社员要把每天劳动所得的大部分交到社里，社里只给记二分半工到三分工。这样，这些社员生活上的困难问题就很难解决。
    这些现象证明，有些领导农业合作社的工作人员，没有从思想上和实际工作上把社的和社员个人的副业同社里的生产很好地结合起来，没有把社员的当前利益和长远利益很好地结合起来。有的笼统地批评社员搞副业是“抓现成”，而不问这种“抓现成”究竟是不是妨碍了农业生产。有的过分强调社员原有的副业入社由社集体经营，而没有认真考虑这些副业是否适宜集体经营；即使适宜，又是否已经具备了集体经营的条件。
    建社的根本目的是提高农业生产，增加社员收入的主要源泉也在这里。这方面的潜力很大，今后应从这里多想办法，这是肯定的。社员从事副业活动，不可妨碍农业生产。但是，领导农业合作社的工作人员，也必须注意充分发挥社和社员的多种多样的副业的作用。要从各方面努力才能保证社员收入增加。增加了副业收入，还可以增加农业生产的投资，对农业生产也是有帮助的。
