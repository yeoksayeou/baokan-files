Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the headquarters of the China Association for Promoting Democracy have issued notices to their respective local organizations, requiring them, under the leadership of the local Communist Party organizations and the People's Government, to mobilize all members to actively participate in the struggle to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group; to learn from the Hu Feng incident, raise vigilance, and struggle against all open and hidden enemies.
This newspaper reports that the headquarters of the China Democratic League held its second symposium to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group on June 14th. More than 30 people attended, including members of the Central Committee in Beijing, committee members from various departments of the headquarters, and some League members from the education sector. The symposium was held in groups, chaired by Qian Jiaju, Sa Kongliao, and Wang Jinding, respectively. Those who spoke in each group included Zang Kejia, Zhou Jingwen, Lin Zhongyi, Zhang Bilai, Tao Dayong, Huang Genyong, Ye Duzhuang, Xie Sijun, Zhang Shuming, Luo Hanxian, Zhang Zhihe, Feng Sutao, Wu Zuxiang, Wang Yao, Ji Xianlin, Ji Zhenhuai, Lin Geng, Feng Youlan, Feng Yidai, Guan Shixiong, Hu Yuzhi, and more than 20 others.
Many people further exposed the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group in their speeches, believing that it is necessary to raise vigilance, overcome the past paralysis of not realizing that the enemy was "sharpening their swords" by their side, and the erroneous idea of still not paying attention to this struggle. Everyone expressed their determination to resolutely expose all counter-revolutionary elements. Everyone also believed that in the future, it is necessary to raise political vigilance, especially to strengthen unity, rely closely on the Party, and plug loopholes to prevent the enemy from infiltrating.
