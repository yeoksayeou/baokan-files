    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 30th - According to TASS on the 29th: According to a Reuters report, West German Chancellor Adenauer submitted a bill to the West German Federal Senate regarding the recruitment of "volunteer soldiers." This bill stipulates that the establishment of the West German armed forces will begin with the establishment of a "volunteer force." The Reuters news said: "This bill is the first legislative step for West Germany to implement the Paris Agreements."
    West Berlin newspapers on the 29th, in reporting this matter, pointed out that the Adenauer government is impatiently hoping to quickly realize the Paris military agreements, especially the establishment of a West German army. The Social Democratic newspaper "Telegraf" published an article entitled "The Federal Chancellor's Overly Hasty Pace." The newspaper quoted Social Democratic authorities as saying that this step taken by Adenauer can only reduce the possibility of restoring German unification. The newspaper also said: "The Social Democratic Party will oppose any attempt to act in such a hurry in the Federal Parliament as well."
    Xinhua News Agency, May 31st - Adenauer's recently launched accelerated rearmament movement has been met with resistance from the West German people.
    In Düsseldorf, when former Hitler General Andre was advocating the establishment of a new "Defense Force" at a rally, those present shouted at him: "Down with Andre!" "War criminals get out!" People stood up and sang a revolutionary song, and the general and his entourage were finally forced to leave the venue.
    In order to escape being drafted into the mercenary army, many West German youths have fled to the German Democratic Republic. Horst Butel, a 24-year-old fitter, said when talking about the reasons for his departure: "I don't understand what I am joining Adenauer's army to defend, who will I fight for and for what purpose."
    More than two hundred agricultural workers and farmers in the village of Ornhausen in Bavaria armed themselves with farm tools to resist the Bonn government's order to forcibly requisition farmland for the construction of military buildings. The armed farmers prevented construction teams from entering the village for surveying and construction, saying: "The confiscated land is the best land in our village and has already been sown, we will never hand over the land we have worked so hard to cultivate!"

    西德人民反抗阿登纳的加速重新武装计划
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社二十九日讯：据路透社报道，西德总理阿登纳向西德联邦参议院提出了一项关于招募“志愿兵”的法案。这项法案规定，建立西德武装部队将从建立“志愿兵部队”开始。路透社消息说：“这个法案是西德实施巴黎协定的第一个立法步骤。”
    西柏林报纸二十九日在报道这件事时指出，阿登纳政府迫不及待地希望赶快实现巴黎军事协定，特别是建立西德军队。社会民主党的报纸“电讯报”以“联邦总理过急的步伐”为题刊载了一篇文章。这家报纸引用社会民主党权威人士的话说，阿登纳所采取的这一步骤只能缩小恢复德国统一的可能性。报纸又说：“社会民主党将反对在联邦议院中也打算这样急急忙忙行事的任何企图。”
    新华社三十一日讯　阿登纳最近发动的加速重新武装运动受到了西德人民的反抗。
    在杜塞尔多夫，当前希特勒将军安德烈在一次集会上鼓吹成立一支新的“国防军”时，到会的人对他大声喊道：“打倒安德烈！”“战犯滚出去！”人们站起来唱起了一支革命歌曲，这位将军和他的随从们终于被迫离开了会场。
    为了逃避被征募参加雇佣军队，已有许多西德青年跑往德意志民主共和国。二十四岁的装配工人霍斯特·布特尔在谈到他的出走原因时说：“我弄不懂参加阿登纳的军队是为了保卫什么，我将为谁和为什么目的而战斗。”
    巴伐利亚州奥恩豪森村的两百多个农业工人和农民用农具把自己武装起来，反抗波恩政府强征耕地修筑军事建筑物的命令。武装起来的农民阻止前往勘察、施工的建筑队进村，他们说：“没收的田地是我们村里最好的土地，并且都已经播了种，我们决不交出我们辛勤耕种着的土地！”
