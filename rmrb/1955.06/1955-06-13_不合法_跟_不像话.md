    "Illegal" and "Outlandish"
    Ruo Shui
    The issue of the purity and health of language has been raised for four years. The People's Daily published the editorial "Correctly Use the Motherland's Language, and Strive for the Purity and Health of Language!" in 1951, which has had a considerable impact in recent years. However, this problem has not been well resolved so far. Articles discussing this issue are rarely seen in general newspapers and magazines, and impure and unhealthy language is still prevalent. Problems of grammar and rhetoric seem to be noticed only by experts and language teachers. Even some writers and translators do not seem to pay much attention to it. Originally, everyone has to speak, and since they have to speak, there are problems of grammar and rhetoric. For those who write and translate articles, this issue is even more important, because their writing is to be read by thousands upon thousands of readers. If articles with grammatical and rhetorical errors often appear in newspapers and magazines, then these errors will "infect" the broad masses. Therefore, writers bear a special and important responsibility for maintaining the purity and health of the motherland's language.
    I think there are often two kinds of problems in our articles: "illegal" and "outlandish."
    What is meant by "illegal"? Law is the rule, the regularity. The law of language is grammar, and the law of thought is logic. Writing that does not conform to grammar or logic is "illegal" writing. There are many examples of both, and it is impossible to list them all, so let's talk about the most popular ones. We now have some very popular words that are very useful in themselves, but they have been ruined by overuse. Some people start with "basically" and end with "mainly," pick up a pen and write "passed," and put down a pen and write "producing," but in fact, after careful investigation, most of them are unnecessary, used when they shouldn't be. For example, someone gives a report and begins by saying: "Today, I mainly want to talk about the issue of..." Since there is "mainly," then of course there is also "secondarily," but after the entire report is finished, only one issue is discussed, with no "mainly" or "secondarily." It can be seen that the phrase "mainly" slipped out, and even the speaker himself doesn't know what it means. This is called improper use of words, "illegally" using the word "mainly." For example, someone writes a self-criticism, and the first sentence is: "I basically completely agree with Comrade So-and-so's criticism." Here, the words "basically" and "completely" were blurted out without going through the brain (please don't refute me with Pavlov's theory). Just ask the author: "Do you 'basically' agree or 'completely' agree?" and he will immediately be "checkmated." This is called self-contradiction, "illegally" linking "basically" and "completely" together. Further investigation reveals that this kind of confused usage also reflects the author's confused thinking: he did not seriously think about whether the criticism of others was "basically" correct or "completely" correct, and just expressed his attitude carelessly. It can be seen that the problem of whether language and writing are legal or not is closely related to the problem of thinking.
    What is meant by "outlandish"? This roughly has two situations: one is an old-fashioned style, not like modern speech; the other is a foreign style, not like Chinese. The former situation is not common now. Some people are extreme in this regard, even opposing the use of classical Chinese vocabulary such as "与" (yǔ - and) and "已" (yǐ - already), but I don't think that's a big problem. It is inevitable that modern writing will retain some classical Chinese vocabulary and grammar components, and what we oppose is only the use of those obscure and dead words. Now, the main force we should use to oppose is probably the impure language that is overly foreignized. The vernacular of the "May Fourth" era was generally very "plain." Later, as it developed, the writing of many writers gradually became Europeanized. Since liberation, more and more people have been learning Russian, and more and more articles have been translated from Russian, so our writing has also been considerably influenced. On the one hand, this is a huge progress. By absorbing vocabulary and grammar components from foreign languages, our language has become richer, more precise, more scientific, and better able to reflect modern life. But on the other hand, it has also produced some drawbacks. Many of the translated articles now, except for the good ones, are really unreadable, rigid, stiff, and verbose. Of course, Lu Xun once advocated "rather be faithful than fluent." In that era, he did this in order to "import new expressions" and enrich our own language, which had positive significance, but he also said, "This situation is certainly not permanent, and part of it will change from 'not fluent' to 'fluent,' while another part will be eliminated and kicked out because it is 'not fluent' after all." Unfortunately, many of our translators now have not recognized this point, and therefore sometimes they not only fail to enrich our language, but also corrupt it.
    To make the motherland's language pure and healthy, we must first make our writers and translators correct those "illegal" languages and cleanse those "outlandish" languages.

### “不合法”跟“不像话”

    “不合法”跟“不像话”
    若水
    语言的纯洁和健康问题，提出来已经四年了。一九五一年人民日报发表了“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！”的社论，在这几年是起了相当的影响的。可是，到现在为止，这个问题还没有很好地解决。一般报纸杂志上很少看见讨论这方面问题的文章，不纯洁不健康的语言还是很流行。语法修辞的问题，好像只有专家和语文教师在注意了。就是有一些著作家、翻译家，好像也不大重视似的。本来，每个人都要讲话，既要讲话，就有语法修辞问题。对于写文章和译文章的人，这个问题就更重要，因为他们的文字是要给上千上万的读者看的。报纸杂志上如果经常出现语法修辞有毛病的文章，那末这些毛病就会“传染”给广大的群众。所以，文字工作者对于维护祖国语言的纯洁和健康负有特殊重大的责任。
    我觉得，我们的文章中经常有这样两种毛病：“不合法”跟“不像话”。
    什么叫做“不合法”？法就是法则，就是规律。语言的规律是语法，思想的规律是逻辑。不合语法不合逻辑的文字，就是“不合法”的文字。这两方面的例子是很多的，要举例也无从举起，就说最流行的吧。我们现在有一些很流行的词儿，本来是很有用的，但用得太滥了，就糟蹋了它们。有的人开口“基本上”，闭口“主要是”，提起笔来“通过了”，放下笔来“产生着”，其实仔细一追究，大部分是不必用，不该用而用的。比如有人做报告，一开头就说：“我今天主要是讲某某问题……”既然有“主要”，那末当然还有“次要”了，可是整个报告作完了，仅仅讲了一个问题，无所谓“主要”“次要”。可见“主要是”这个字眼，是顺口滑出来的，连讲话的人自己也不知道它表达什么意思。这叫用词不当，“非法”地使用了“主要是”这个词儿。再比如有人写检讨，第一句话就是：“我对某某同志的批评，基本上完全同意。”这里“基本上”跟“完全”两个词，就是没有通过大脑（请别拿巴甫洛夫的学说来反驳我）跑出来的。只要问作者一句：“你到底是‘基本上’同意呢，还是‘完全’同意呢？”他马上就会被“将了军”的。这叫做自相矛盾，“非法”地把“基本上”和“完全”联在一起。进一步追究，这种用语的混乱也反映了作者思想的混乱：他没有严肃认真地想过别人的批评究竟是“基本上”对还是“完全”对，马马虎虎就表示了态度。可见语言文字合法不合法的问题是跟思维问题密切关联的。
    什么叫做“不像话”？这大体上也有两种情形：一是古腔古调，不像现代话；一是洋腔洋调，不像中国话。前一种情况现在不多了。有人在这方面表现得极端化，连“与”“已”这些文言字汇都反对用，我以为那不是什么大问题。现代文里头保留一些文言的语汇成分跟文法成分，是不可避免的，我们所反对的只是使用那些生僻的已经死去的字。现在我们应该用主要的力量来反对的，恐怕倒是那种过分外国化的不纯洁的语言。“五四”时代的白话文，一般是很“白”的。后来发展下去，许多作家的文字就逐渐欧化起来。解放以后，学俄文的人越来越多了，从俄文翻译过来的文章也越来越多了，我们的文字也受了相当的影响。这一方面是一种巨大的进步，由于吸收了外国语中的语汇成分跟文法成分，我们的语言就更丰富，更严密，更有科学性，更能反映现代生活了。但是另一方面也产生了一些流弊。现在的翻译文章，除开那些好的以外，有许多真叫人读不下去，又死板，又生硬，又啰嗦。当然，鲁迅曾主张过“宁信而不顺”，他在那个时代，为了“输入新的表现法”，丰富我们自己的语言而这样做，是有积极意义的，不过他也说过，“这情形也当然不是永远的，其中的一部分，将从‘不顺’而成为‘顺’，有一部分，则因为到底‘不顺’而被淘汰，被踢开。”可惜我们现在的许多翻译家，是没有认识到这一点的，因而有时不但没有丰富我们的语言，反而败坏了我们的语言。
    要使祖国的语言纯洁而健康，首先要使我们的著作家和翻译家纠正那些“不合法”的语言，清洗那些“不像话”的语言。
