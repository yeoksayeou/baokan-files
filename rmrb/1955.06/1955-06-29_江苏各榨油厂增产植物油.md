Jiangsu Oil Mills Increase Vegetable Oil Production

The entire staff of the Jiangsu Province Oil Industry had, by the end of May, increased vegetable oil production for the state by 3,866 tons.

Due to attention paid to improving the oil extraction rate, the average oil extraction rate per 100 jin of oilseeds in Jiangsu Province's oil industry plants increased by 1.2 jin compared to 1954. In May of this year, the oil extraction rate of peanut kernels reached 42.28 jin, an increase of 2.26 jin compared to 1954; soybeans reached 12.99 jin, an increase of 1.38 jin compared to 1954. Since January, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry has conducted experiments in Yangzhou Vegetable Oil Factory, Wuxi Cooperative Oil Factory, and Huangqiao Oil Factory, affirming six major operating methods. Yangzhou Vegetable Oil Factory applied the "Automatic Screw Press Rapeseed Operation Method" to peanut kernel oil extraction production, maintaining a stable residual oil rate in the dry cake at around 3.7%. Workers at Huangqiao Oil Factory broke the claim that peanut kernels are unsuitable for wooden presses, using the rapeseed operation method for production, reducing the residual oil rate in the dry cake of peanut kernels from about 8% to about 4.8%. Wuxi Cooperative Oil Factory summarized the experience of soybean oil extraction during the experiments, stabilizing the residual oil rate in the dry cake at below 4.5%. Through experiments, the factories have improved their technical and management levels.

Recently, under the leadership of the Provincial People's Committee, the province's oil industry has improved the work-payment system and uniformly arranged production. Seven factories, including Yangzhou Vegetable Oil Factory, have officially launched inter-factory competitions. The workers are actively implementing measures centered on increasing the oil extraction rate, striving to exceed the production target of 10,000 tons of oil. (Our correspondent in Nanjing)

    江苏各榨油厂增产植物油
    江苏省油脂工业全体职工到五月底止，已经为国家增产了三千八百六十六吨植物油。
    江苏省油脂工业各厂由于注意提高出油率，每百斤油料的出油率平均都比一九五四年提高一点二斤。今年五月份花生仁的出油率达到四十二点二八斤，比一九五四年增产二点二六斤；大豆十二点九九斤，比一九五四年增产一点三八斤。从一月份以来，江苏省工业厅先后在扬州植物油厂、无锡合作油厂和黄桥油厂作了试验，肯定了六种主要操作方法。扬州植物油厂并把其中的“自动螺旋机菜籽操作法”运用在花生仁榨油的生产上，使干饼残油率长期稳定在三点七左右。黄桥油厂工人则打破了花生仁不适合木榨的说法，用菜籽操作法生产，使花生仁的干饼残油率由百分之八左右下降到百分之四点八左右；无锡合作油厂在试验中，总结了榨豆油的经验，使该厂干饼残油率稳定在百分之四点五以下。各厂通过试验，提高了企业的技术水平和管理水平。
    最近，全省油脂工业在省人民委员会领导下，改进了工缴制度，统一安排了生产。扬州植物油厂等七个工厂正式开展了厂际竞赛，职工们正积极以贯彻提高出油率为中心，为超额完成生产一万吨油脂而努力。（本报驻南京记者）
