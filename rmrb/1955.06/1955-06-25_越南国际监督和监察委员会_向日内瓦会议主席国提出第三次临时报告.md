Xinhua News Agency, June 25th -- The International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission in Vietnam has submitted its third interim report to the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference—the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. This report has recently been distributed by the governments of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom to the participating countries of the Geneva Conference.

The report describes the implementation of the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam" and the work of the International Commission in Vietnam during the two months from February 11 to April 10, 1955.

The report points out that during this period, the International Commission sent five mobile teams to the military control areas of the French Union forces to investigate incidents of undermining democratic freedoms. In six incidents that were investigated and concluded, the Commission affirmed that in four of these incidents, the French side violated Article 14(c) of the Armistice Agreement. Therefore, the International Commission requested the French side to punish the relevant personnel who violated the agreement in accordance with Article 22 of the agreement.

The report mentions the implementation of the provisions in the agreement regarding the release of prisoners of war and detained civilians. The Commission felt uneasy about the delays encountered in the investigative work in the French Union forces' areas due to the obstruction of the South Vietnamese authorities in carrying out the above-mentioned work. The International Commission is investigating the incidents of illegal detention of detained civilians by the French side. The Commission believes that the Vietnamese side has not fully implemented the recommendations made by the Commission regarding simplifying the procedures for issuing relocation permits and providing transportation convenience for the relocators.

The report points out that the Commission has consulted with both the Vietnamese and French sides on the issue of deserters and defectors and has reached a satisfactory and practical solution. The Vietnamese side has handed over 222 such personnel who were willing to return to the French side's areas to the French side, and 369 illegal foreign nationals who were unwilling to be sent back to the French side were repatriated through China. The Commission sent teams to observe this release work and found no cases of forced repatriation.

The report further points out that the teams sent by the Commission to Gao Ping, Tong Deng in North Vietnam and Lu Ning in South Vietnam to supervise the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of war materials did not find any violations of the agreement. In order to more effectively supervise the rotation and replacement, the Commission has made the following arrangements: (1) The Lang Son fixed team has been moved to Tong Deng; (2) The mobile teams in Gao Ping and Lu Ning will continue to carry out supervision until May 31, 1955. In addition, the International Commission has also designated the Dong Hoi fixed team to send mobile personnel to areas ten kilometers on each side of the temporary military demarcation line, starting from April 6, 1955, to carry out supervision work.

The report concludes by pointing out that regarding the cooperation between the Commission and the Vietnamese and French sides, many local authorities on both sides have not provided the necessary convenience and assistance to the Commission's teams. The Commission specifically mentioned that the situation mentioned in the second interim report, in which the South Vietnamese authorities believe that they are not bound by the Armistice Agreement, still exists. The Commission believes that the demonstrations, including the use of violence, that occurred in the South Vietnamese region against the teams and the personnel accompanying the teams during investigations are inappropriate.

    越南国际监督和监察委员会
    向日内瓦会议主席国提出第三次临时报告
    新华社二十五日讯　越南国际监督和监察委员会向日内瓦会议主席国——苏联和英国提出了第三次临时报告。这个报告最近已由苏、英两国政府分送给日内瓦会议的参加国。
    报告叙述了自一九五五年二月十一日至四月十日两个月来“越南停止敌对行动协定”的执行情况和越南国际委员会的工作情况。
    报告指出，在此期间内，国际委员会曾派出五个机动小组至法兰西联邦部队军事控制地区内对破坏民主自由事件进行调查。在调查结束的六起事件中，委员会肯定其中有四起事件法方违反了停战协定第十四条丙款，因此，国际委员会要求法方按照协定第二十二条惩处违反协定的有关人员。
    报告提到协定中释放战俘和被拘平民条款的执行情况。委员会对法兰西联邦部队地区中执行上述工作时，由于南越当局的阻挠，使调查工作受到延误，感到不安。关于法方非法扣留被拘平民的事件，国际委员会正在调查中。委员会认为越方在简化颁发迁居证的手续和提供迁居者以交通便利方面，对委员会所提建议还未完全执行。
    报告指出，委员会已同越、法双方就降兵和逃兵问题进行商讨，并得出一令人满意的切实可行的解决办法。越方已将二百二十二名愿回法方地区的此类人员交给法方，并将三百六十九名不愿被送回法方的非法籍人员经由中国予以遣返。委员会曾派遣小组观察了此项释放工作，并未发现有强迫遣返的情况。
    报告又指出，委员会派往北越高平、同登和南越禄宁对军事人员轮换和作战物资替换进行监督的小组，并未发现任何违反协定事件。为了对轮换、替换进行更为有效的监督，委员会已作如下安排：（1）谅山固定小组移至同登；（2）高平和禄宁的机动小组继续进行监督，至一九五五年五月三十一日止。此外，国际委员会并已指定东会固定小组派出机动人员赴临时军事分界线两方各十公里地区，于一九五五年四月六日起开始进行监督工作。
    报告最后指出，关于委员会和越、法双方间的合作问题，双方的许多地方当局没有给委员会的小组以必要的便利和协助。委员会特别提到在第二次临时报告中所提到的南越当局自以为不受停战协定约束的情况仍然存在。委员会认为小组在南越地区进行调查时所发生的反对小组和小组随行人员的包括使用暴力的游行示威，是不应该的。
