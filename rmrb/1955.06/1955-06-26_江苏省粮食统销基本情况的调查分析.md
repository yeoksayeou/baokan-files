After Jiangsu Province universally carried out the work of rectifying grain unified sales, grain sales began to decline in May, and the supply gradually became normal. Grain sales in May decreased by 10% compared to April, and by 6.1% compared to the same period last year. The average daily sales volume has decreased from 27.36 million jin in April to 23.96 million jin; the average daily sales volume in early June has further decreased to 18.3 million jin.

The Universal "Tension" is a False Phenomenon

Since the Spring Festival this year, the volume of grain sales in the Jiangsu market has been increasing month by month. From January to April this year, grain sales increased by 28.6% compared to the same period last year. The average daily sales volume for each month was: 19.59 million jin in January, 22.03 million jin in February, 27.26 million jin in March, and 27.36 million jin in April. If calculated according to one jin of raw grain supplied per person per day, March and April each equaled the supply of 66% of the province's population, and the grain supply could no longer be considered small. However, during this period, the grain problem in some rural areas once appeared "tense", especially during the period from late March to early April. Some farmers were ideologically confused, complained, and said strange things. Their production enthusiasm was not stable enough. A few farmers went to the township government or looked for village staff to request supplies. In a few villages, some farmers even went to nearby towns to compete for cooked food; and landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to instigate sabotage and stir up trouble. This situation spread to the cities and also caused misunderstandings among some urban people. Many comrades lacked serious investigation and analysis of this situation, and were often deceived by a superficial "tense" situation, blindly followed the shouting, and some even mistakenly regarded individual local phenomena as universal phenomena, blurring their understanding of the rural situation and the grain problem.

After various localities in Jiangsu Province followed the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council and successively carried out the work of rectifying grain unified sales, leading comrades at all levels conducted more serious investigation and research, gradually clarified the situation, and gradually saw the problem clearly, and had a unified and correct understanding of the situation of grain unified purchase and sales. In general, the grain purchase and sales situation in Jiangsu Province is indeed relatively tight; but it is only partially tight, not universally tight. The universal cry of "tension" in March and April is mainly a false phenomenon. This can be explained from the following aspects:

First, from a regional perspective, the degree of tightness varies from region to region. Some places are particularly tight, some places are generally tight, and some places are not tight at all. Among the eight special districts in the province, Yangzhou and Huaiyin are relatively stable, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and Yancheng have a few counties that are more tense, and Songjiang, Nantong, and Xuzhou have a considerable number of counties that are more tense. Among the 69 counties in the province, 31.9% are relatively stable; 44.9% have a small number of districts and townships that are tense; and 23.2% have most districts and townships that are tense. Among the 708 districts in the province (excluding the suburbs of the twelve cities), 48.7% are relatively stable; 36.9% have a small number of villages that are tense; and 14.4% have most villages that are tense. Taking townships as an example, among the 568 townships in Lianshui, Shuyang, and Huaian counties, 60.6% are stable; 37.3% are partially tense, and 2.1% are tense. Danyang County is one of the more tense counties in the province. Among the 1,385 electoral districts in the county, 648 electoral districts were once tense, but only 152 electoral districts were actually caused by insufficient supply, accounting for 10.9% of the total number of electoral districts. Among the remaining 496 "tense" electoral districts, 430 electoral districts were caused by irresponsible cadres, random issuance of notes, unreasonably wide supply, or other problems in the work, and 66 electoral districts were caused by instigation and sabotage led by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. It can be seen that the truly tense areas have a smaller percentage the further down the level, and the tension caused by insufficient supply accounts for only a small number; the vast majority of areas are stable or basically stable, and the grain left for farmers in these areas plus the state supply is enough to eat.

Second, in places where there are supply disturbances, although there are many people requesting supplies, generally no more than 5% are actually short of grain and need supplies. For example, in Sanlimiao Village, Huazumiao Township, Feng County, 31 households requested supplies, accounting for 29.2% of the total number of households, of which only 5 households were actually short of grain, accounting for 4.7% of the total number of households. In Xiaoshijie, Xuzhou City, 53 households requested supplies (including 5 rich peasants, 8 landlords, 2 illegal capitalists, 8 puppet personnel, and 1 witch), accounting for 4.8% of the total number of households; of which only 8 households actually needed supplies, accounting for 0.7% of the total number of households. In Cheban Township, Wujin County, there were 1,414 households, and 787 households had been supplied. A total of 536,000 jin were supplied for the five months from February to June. The supply was already widespread and large in quantity, but there were still people clamoring for supplies; after propaganda and education, only 4 households actually lacked grain and requested supplementary supplies, accounting for 0.3%.

According to the investigation and understanding in the work of rectifying grain unified sales, there are currently four situations for people in rural areas requesting supplies: (1) A very small number of people are truly short of grain due to untimely or insufficient supply. There are several reasons for untimely or insufficient supply: some are because the local grain unified sales targets have been broken through by people who do not lack grain, and the grain controlled by the township has been completely sold; some are because the village staff are afraid of "one branch moving, a hundred branches shaking", knowing that the supply is not enough, but are afraid that everyone will want to increase if one person is supplemented; some are because the village staff see that there are too many people wanting to supply, and the grain target controlled by the township is not enough to distribute, so they dare not agree. (2) People who are not short of grain but request supplies. There are several situations: some are afraid of being said to have surplus grain, afraid of having to sell the remaining debt grain. Some are afraid of revealing wealth and afraid of "adjustment." For example, in Xiaoqiao Village, Huangjing Township, Jiangyin County, all 75 households in the village ate vegetable porridge and did not dare to eat rice, mainly because they were afraid of forced "adjustment"; after propaganda and education, the state's grain policy was explained, and it was announced that "adjustment" would not be forced. The next day, 73 households changed to eating rice porridge, and a few households even changed to eating dry rice, while only two households that were truly difficult still ate vegetable porridge. Some have serious conservative ideas and refuse to eat grain even if they have it. For example, Liu Baoquan's family in Xinglong Township, Suining County, had 840 jin of grain, but two people were "fleeing famine" outside. (3) People who have grain now, but are afraid that they will not get timely supplies when they are short of grain in the future. There are also several situations: some believe rumors that "there is no grain, the state supplies in March, but not in April," and rush to buy early; some blindly follow others, and are afraid of being said to have grain if they don't want it when others want it. For example, a farmer in Taizhou City queued up to buy cooked food. When people asked him "why are you queuing up," he said: "I don't know myself; if others come, I will come too." (4) The clamoring of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. They clamor the most fiercely and have the most methods of procuring grain and snatching cooked food. For example, Xu Lushi, a rich peasant in Chengbei Township, Qingpu County, clamored for supplies every day. Later, it was discovered that she had more than 1,000 jin of grain hidden in 45 places. Forty-eight of the 49 rich peasant households in Loubei Township, Wuxian County, snatched cooked food in Suzhou City. Some rich peasants also engaged in speculative business of transporting grain and cooked food. For example, a rich peasant in Fengxian County transported cooked food to Shanghai and was investigated by the Public Security Bureau three times in a row.

Third, the production enthusiasm of the vast majority of farmers has always been normal. For example, for water conservancy construction, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers were mobilized last winter and this spring to carry out huge water conservancy projects. By the end of May, 100 million cubic meters of earthwork had been completed, large-scale water conservancy projects had been basically completed, and small-scale farmland water conservancy projects had been completed by 60%. Spring planting work has completed the state's plan. Field management of summer harvest crops is generally well done; in southern Jiangsu, wheat has generally increased in production this year compared to last year, except for a few areas where there was a poor harvest. Mutual aid and cooperation organizations have also developed greatly during this period. Farmers are very enthusiastic about joining agricultural producers' cooperatives. The number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province has developed to more than 32,000 (excluding more than 8,000 cooperatives spontaneously organized by farmers). After the end of the state's grain unified purchase movement, it also purchased 100 million jin of grain through free purchase; in March and April, state grain markets in various counties had thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of jin of grain on the market, where farmers conducted free grain adjustment and variety exchange. From this, it can be seen that the grain problem in Jiangsu Province is not "unified purchase is generally too high, and unified sales are generally too tight." If that were the case, the farmers' production enthusiasm would not be so normal, the various tasks of the heavy rural work in winter and spring would not have been completed so smoothly, and there would not have been so much grain on the market after the unified purchase was completed.

Where is the Reason for the "Tension" Once?

What exactly is the reason for the "tension" situation in Jiangsu Province once? According to the specific analysis of the materials obtained from various aspects in the past few months, and according to the research at the recent county party secretary meeting held by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, there are the following reasons:

The most fundamental reason, of course, is that the rate of grain production growth cannot keep up with the rate of growth in national construction, natural population increase, and the universal increase in grain consumption by farmers after land reform. For example, Minhang Town in Shanghai County had only 7,000 people when it was first liberated, but now it has developed to more than 31,000 people. Several new factories have been built, and there are now more than 10,000 workers; a factory in Nanjing had only 60 or 70 people when it was first liberated, but now it has 1,400 people, an increase of twenty times. The population of Jiangsu Province increases by an average of about 2% per year; people's lives are also constantly improving, and universally improving. Before liberation, only a few landlords and rich peasants in rural areas lived affluent lives, and some middle peasants lived slightly better lives; after liberation, after land reform and the development of agricultural production, the vast majority of farmers (especially poor peasants) have gotten rid of feudal exploitation and changed the semi-starved living conditions of eating vegetables for half a year. Grain consumption has increased universally. At the same time, the yearly expansion of the planting area of cash crops has also relatively reduced grain production. The cotton planting area in Jiangsu Province was 9.55 million mu in 1952 and increased to 10.6 million mu in 1954. Judging from these situations, a shortage of grain is inevitable. However, these situations alone are not enough to cause the degree of "tension" like in the past few months. Although the speed of grain production is relatively slow, it has still increased compared to the past.

Last year, Jiangsu suffered floods that were unprecedented in a century. In severely affected areas, not only could grain unified purchase not be carried out, but grain had to be supplied to them. Last winter, there were 537 disaster-stricken townships in the province, accounting for 5% of the total number of townships, which did not carry out unified purchase, and these townships were mostly high-yielding rice areas. The grain unified purchase task in some lightly affected areas was also reduced. In addition to supplying food rations in the disaster-stricken areas, summer planting seeds and food rations to subsidize migrant workers during the repair of dikes were also supplied. In addition, the climate was abnormal after the Spring Festival, and a lot of sweet potatoes rotted in some areas of Xuzhou and Huaiyin special districts. These are all reasons for the need to increase grain supply. However, judging from the aforementioned provincial unified purchase and sales figures, this difficulty is not insurmountable.

Was too much grain purchased? It is true that some farmers temporarily sold some of their food rations for urgent living needs; it is also true that a few party members, league members, and activists sold "excessive grain" during the unified purchase. However, the former situation has always been the case and is difficult to avoid in the short term, so it cannot be regarded as the reason for the "tension" of grain once this year; the latter situation is only a very small number after all, and the government can guarantee to make up for the grain they need, so it is not the main reason for the special "tension" once.

The grain purchase figure in Jiangsu Province this year is a bit large, and the amount of grain left for farmers in some townships is indeed a bit small. The grain output in Jiangsu Province in 1954 was less than in 1953, while the actual grain purchase in 1954 was basically equal to that in 1953. 1953 was the first year of implementing grain unified purchase and sales, and farmers still had surplus grain from previous years. At the same time, the part of the purchase exempted or reduced in disaster areas last year was added to non-disaster areas, which made the unified purchase task in non-disaster areas seem larger. However, the completion of the grain purchase task in the province is uneven. About 10% of the townships did not purchase enough. For example, Songjiang Special District is a relatively tight area for unified purchase in the province. Among the 545 townships in the entire special district, 67 townships still did not purchase enough, accounting for 12.29% of the total number of townships; about 65% to 70% of the townships have a relatively appropriate unified purchase; about 20% to 25% of the townships have a relatively tight unified purchase (the degree of tightness also varies. Some villages are not tight, and individual households still have surplus grain that has not been sold). There are 39 farm households in Lijiazhuang, Tangshan Town, Jiangning County, including 32 surplus grain households; according to the inspection after the unified purchase, there were two households whose surplus grain was sold excessively, and one household whose surplus grain was not sold enough. Although the fixed production in some villages is somewhat high, the actual grain retention is not tight because the unified purchase is insufficient. For example, in Zhujiashan Village, Fudong Township, Jiangning County, the fixed production was 400 jin, and it was calculated that 110,000 jin of surplus grain should be sold. As a result, only 30,000 jin were purchased; in Qishan Township, Pei County, it was calculated that 300,000 jin of surplus grain should be sold, and the actual unified purchase was 137,000 jin.

Was the supply of grain too little? The supply volume in March and April, calculated at one jin per person per day, is equivalent to supplying 66% of the province's population, which cannot be said to be too little in any case. However, the work of grain unified sales in various parts of Jiangsu is uneven, and some places have not done it in a timely manner. Leading staff at all levels do not have a sufficient understanding of the arduousness of the work of grain unified sales, and lack regular supervision and inspection. Therefore, many problems existing in the work have not been corrected in a timely manner. Some places issue certificates sloppily and issue grain purchase certificates by mistake. Some places did not go through mass appraisal when issuing certificates. Village staff were afraid of offending people and believed that those who "clamor fiercely, want it tightly, and resist firmly" were grain-deficient households, so they blindly issued grain purchase certificates to them. Some wrote the numbers on the supply certificate incorrectly; some supply certificates were altered. In Shuqing District, Taixing County, the supply plan was broken through by 90,000 jin in April, of which more than 40,000 jin belonged to alterations. Some places emphasized taking care of "special circumstances," and grassroots staff issued notes at will, increasing temporary supplies. Some grassroots staff could not write and gave blank supply certificates to people who had been puppet heads and landlords and rich peasant elements to fill in; these people took the opportunity to cheat. In Hongzhuang Township, Suining County, puppet personnel wrote nine surplus grain households as grain-deficient households. Some places did not record the supply and repeated the supply. In some places, the grassroots organization was impure, and a few grassroots staff were selfish and even engaged in favoritism and fraud, sheltering landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements. These are one of the main reasons for creating artificial "tension."

In the past, Jiangsu Province also had a major shortcoming in its work, that is, in the process of grain unified purchase and sales, it underestimated the frantic sabotage of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements, and did not strike hard enough. Landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements were very rampant in their sabotage activities during the grain purchase and sales movement. They spread rumors everywhere, stirred up the relationship between workers and peasants, and win over the masses. In grain unified sales, from mid-February to May 10, 1955 alone, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements led 164 food disturbance events in various parts of the province. Most of these events occurred in backward villages where land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were not done well. The slogans used by counter-revolutionary elements to instigate supply disturbances were generally "Whoever does not participate is the one who has grain, and we will go to their house to eat!" In addition, the sabotage tricks of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements include pretending to be poor, complaining, snatching cooked food, engaging in black market speculation, and giving petty favors to bribe cadres and win over peasants. In short, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements did everything they could to sabotage the work of grain unified purchase and sales. They desperately searched for gaps in every possible way, instigated the masses, and created events. This shows that in the process of socialist revolution, the class struggle in rural areas is very acute and fierce, but in the past we did not have enough understanding and analysis of this situation, and the crackdown on the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements was not enough. At the same time, many places lacked regular education for farmers. On the one hand, farmers had doubts and concerns, and on the other hand, they could not identify the conspiracies of class enemies, and some people were fooled by the enemy. Therefore, it also increased the artificial "tension" of the grain problem.

Consolidate the Achievements of Rectifying Grain Unified Sales

In the urban areas of Jiangsu Province, the work of rectifying grain unified sales began in January. At that time, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to strengthen the work of grain unified sales in urban areas, focusing on advocating grain conservation and opposing grain waste among urban people, and reasonably compressing urban grain sales. In the rural areas, starting from early March, the work of rectifying grain unified sales and grain "three fix" work was carried out in conjunction with agricultural production; by the end of May, 9,149 townships in the province had undergone remedial grain unified sales, accounting for 99.5% of the total number of townships; 8,418 townships had announced grain "three fix" indicators, accounting for 91.6% of the total number of townships.

Facts in various places have proved that the masses of farmers resolutely support the policy of grain unified purchase and sales. In the past two years, they have personally experienced the benefits of the state's implementation of grain unified purchase and sales; especially after the rare flood last year, the price of grain remained stable as usual, and the feeling was particularly profound. The masses in the disaster area of Jiangning County said: In the great flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, there were three changes in rural areas: the price of rice soared, families were torn apart, and fertile land was deserted. This year, the price of rice is stable, families are reunited, and dikes are quickly repaired, and no change has occurred. Farmers in Hedong Township, Jiangdu County, said: In the past, there was Wu Zhide (a grain profiteer) in Zhuanqiao Town, and there was Chu Delu (a rich peasant and usurer) in the township. Selling grain had to be exploited by them; if the state had not implemented unified purchase and sales, grain merchants would have rebelled and rich peasants would have skinned farmers this year after such a big flood last year. In the work of rectifying unified sales, many places have educated farmers, explained the state's grain situation and grain unified sales policy, and many farmers have regretted that they were confused for a while and were fooled by rich peasants and bad elements, realizing that running around and clamoring everywhere delayed production and undermined the grain unified sales plan, which was not good for the state or for themselves. After the socialist consciousness of the masses of farmers was raised, they were unwilling to create difficulties for the state. On the contrary, they were willing to help the state reasonably solve the grain supply problem.

Through remedial grain unified sales and grain "three fix" work, farmers have once again received profound socialist education, further understood the country's grain situation, further understood the state's grain unified purchase and sales policy, and eliminated various misunderstandings and concerns. Many farmers reflected: "'Three fixes' arrived, and the heart no longer jumps." "With 'three fixes,' the country is happy, the farmers are happy, and the cadres are happy." "'Three fixes' settle the heart, the country has a base for good construction, the farmers have a base for good production, and the cadres have a base for good work." This has greatly eased the farmers' nervous psychology on the grain issue, thereby reducing the supply area and supply volume to varying degrees in various places, generally decreasing by 20% to 30% compared to the original grain supply figures required by the farmers, and achieving basic rationality in supply. At the same time, the central government also supplemented Jiangsu Province with a portion of unified sales grain in March and April. Many townships with more unified purchase grain and tighter grain retention have solved the difficulties of some farmers' food rations in the work of rectifying unified sales, which is actually returning a portion of the grain to those farmers who sold "excessive grain."

Now, the grain supply figures in Jiangsu Province are sufficient to meet the needs of the people of the province for grain. In addition, the wheat has been harvested, and grain-deficient households have received their food rations, which has further stabilized the rural grain situation. Only the single-crop rice and late rice areas and a small number of areas that did not plant wheat last autumn due to water accumulation must continue to firmly grasp the work of remedial grain unified sales. Various parts of the province are now combining summer harvest and summer planting, based on the "three fix" of grain, reasonably distributing the third quarter grain sales indicators; after fully preparing, announcing the third quarter grain sales figures to the masses by township to ensure that the control indicators are not broken through. At the same time, the phenomenon of overly wide urban grain unified sales is also being resolutely reversed according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, combined with local conditions, and effective measures are being taken to further consolidate the achievements of the previous period's work of rectifying grain unified sales.

    江苏省粮食统销基本情况的调查分析
    杨伟林
    江苏省普遍地进行整顿粮食统销工作以后，从五月份起粮食销量开始下降，供应逐步走向正常。五月份粮食销售量比四月份下降了百分之十，比去年同期下降了百分之六点一，平均日销量已由四月份的二千七百三十六万斤下降到二千三百九十六万斤；六月上旬平均日销量又下降到一千八百三十万斤。
    普遍“紧张”是虚假现象
    从今年春节起，江苏省市场粮食销售量逐月上升。今年一至四月份的粮食销售量同去年同一时期相比增加百分之二十八点六。各月平均日销量：一月份为一千九百五十九万斤，二月份为二千二百零三万斤，三月份为二千七百二十六万斤，四月份为二千七百三十六万斤。如按每人每天供应一斤原粮计算，三、四月份各等于供应全省人口的百分之六十六，粮食供应已经不能算少。可是，正在这个期间，农村部分地区的粮食问题却一度出现“紧张”状况，尤以三月下旬到四月上旬这一段时间内最为“紧张”，部分农民思想混乱，发牢骚，说怪话，生产情绪不够安定，少数农民到乡政府或找乡村工作人员要求供应，少数乡村还有农民到附近城镇争购熟食品；而地主、富农、反革命分子更乘机进行挑拨破坏，兴风作浪。这种情况传到了城市，也引起了部分城市人民的误解。有许多同志对这种情况缺乏认真调查研究和分析，往往为一种表面的“紧张”状况所迷惑，也盲目地跟着喊叫，有的甚至错误地把个别的局部的现象当做整个的普遍的现象，模糊了对农村情况和粮食问题的认识。
    江苏省各地遵照中共中央和国务院的指示，相继进行了整顿粮食统销工作以后，各级领导同志比较认真地进行了调查研究，逐步摸清了情况，逐渐看清楚了问题，对粮食统购统销的情况有了统一的正确的认识。从总的方面说来，江苏省粮食购销情况确实是比较紧的；但也只是部分的紧，不是普遍的紧。三、四月间普遍喊“紧张”，主要是虚假现象。这可以从以下几个方面来说明：
    第一、从地区来看，各个地区紧的程度是不同的，有的地方特别紧，有的地方一般紧，也有的地方并不紧。全省八个专区，比较平稳的有扬州、淮阴两专区，有少数县较紧张的有苏州、镇江、盐城三个专区，有相当一部分县较紧张的有松江、南通、徐州三个专区。全省六十九个县，比较平稳的占百分之三十一点九；有一小部分区乡紧张的占百分之四十四点九；大部分区乡紧张的占百分之二十三点二。全省七百零八个区（不包括十二个市的郊区），比较平稳的占百分之四十八点七；有一小部分乡村紧张的占百分之三十六点九；大部分乡村紧张的占百分之十四点四。按乡来看，涟水、沭阳、淮安三个县五百六十八个乡中，平稳的占百分之六十点六；部分紧张的占百分之三十七点三，紧张的占百分之二点一。丹阳县是全省比较紧张的县之一，全县一千三百八十五个选区，曾一度发生紧张的有六百四十八个选区，但真正因供应数量不足而引起的只有一百五十二个选区，占总选区数的百分之十点九，其余四百九十六个“紧张”的选区中，因干部不负责任、乱打条子，供应偏宽不合理或其他工作上的毛病而造成的有四百三十个选区，地主、富农、反革命分子为首煽动破坏所造成的有六十六个选区。由此可见，真正紧张的地区，越到下面百分比就越小，真正因供应数量不足而引起紧张的只占少数；绝大多数地区是平稳的或基本平稳的，在这些地区留给农民的粮食加上国家供应是够吃的。
    第二、在发生闹供应的现象的地方，要求供应的人虽多，但真正因缺粮而要供应的，一般也不过百分之五左右。如丰县华祖庙乡三里庙村要求供应的三十一户，占总户数百分之二十九点二，其中真正缺粮的只有五户，占总户数百分之四点七。徐州市小市街要求供应的五十三户（其中包括富农五户，地主八户，不法资本家二户，伪人员八户，巫婆一户），占总户数百分之四点八；其中真正缺粮须供应的只有八户，占总户数百分之零点七。武进县车板乡一千四百十四户，已供应七百八十七户，二月到六月的五个月共供应五十三万六千斤，供应已是面广量大，但还有人吵要供应；经过宣传教育以后，真正缺粮要求补充供应的只有四户，占百分之零点三。
    根据在整顿粮食统销工作中的调查了解，目前农村要求供应的人，有四种情况：（一）真正缺粮因供应不及时或供应不足的，这是极少数。供应不及时或供应不足的原因有几种：有的是当地粮食统销指标被不缺粮的人突破了，乡里控制的粮食已全部销完；有的是乡村工作人员怕“一枝动，百枝摇”，明知供应不够，但怕补了一人，大家都要增加；有的是乡村工作人员看到要供应的人太多，乡里控制的粮食指标不够分配，不敢答应。（二）不缺粮而要求供应的。这有几种情况：有的是怕人家说有余粮，怕要追卖尾欠粮。有的是怕露富、怕“调剂”。如江阴县璜泾乡小桥村全村七十五户家家吃菜粥，不敢吃大米饭，主要是怕强迫“调剂”；经过宣传教育，讲清了国家的粮食政策，宣布不强迫“调剂”，第二天七十三户都改吃大米粥，有几户还改吃干饭，只有两户真正困难仍吃菜粥。有的是有严重保守思想，有粮硬不吃。如睢宁县兴隆乡刘保全家有粮八百四十斤，却有两个人在外“逃荒”。（三）现在有粮，但怕将来缺粮时得不到及时供应的。这也有几种情况：有的是轻信谣言，说“粮食没有了，国家三月供应，四月不供应”，抢早买；有的是盲目地跟着别人走，别人要，自己不要怕人家说自己有粮。如泰州市有个农民排队抢购熟食品，人家问他“为什么排队”，他说：“我自己也不知道；人家来，我也来。”（四）地主、富农、反革命分子的叫嚣。他们叫嚣得最凶，套购粮食，抢购熟食品的方法也最多。如青浦县城北乡富农徐陆氏天天吵闹要供应，后来发现她家里还有一千多斤粮食，分藏在四十五处。吴县娄北乡四十九户富农有四十八户到苏州市抢购熟食品。还有些富农做贩运粮食和熟食品的投机生意。如奉贤县有个富农到上海贩运熟食品，被公安局连续查到三次。
    第三、绝大多数农民的生产情绪一贯是正常的。如兴修水利，去冬今春动员了一百几十万的民工进行了巨大的水利工程，到五月底止已完成土方一亿公方，大型水利已基本完成，小型农田水利已完成百分之六十。春播工作完成了国家的计划。夏收作物田间管理一般也做得不错；苏南地区今年麦子除少数地区歉收外，普遍比去年增产。互助合作组织在这一期间已有很大的发展，农民要求参加农业生产合作社的热情很高，全省农业生产合作社已发展到三万二千多个（农民自发组织起来的八千多个社未计算在内）。国家在粮食统购运动结束后，还通过自由收购购进了一亿斤的粮食；在三、四月份内，各县的国家粮食市场上都有数千斤、十几万斤以至几十万斤粮食上市，在这些市场上农民群众间进行了粮食自由调剂和品种交换。由此可以看到，江苏省粮食问题并不是“统购普遍偏高，统销普遍偏紧”，如果真是那样，农民的生产情绪就不会这样正常，冬春繁重的农村工作的各项任务就不会这样比较顺利地完成，统购结束后也不会还有这样多的粮食上市。
    一度“紧张”的原因何在
    江苏省一度呈现粮食“紧张”情况的原因究竟在哪里呢？根据几个月来从各方面调查得来的材料的具体分析，根据最近中共江苏省委召开的县委书记会议上的研究，有以下几个原因：
    最根本的原因，当然是粮食生产增长的速度赶不上国家建设的发展、人口的自然增殖和土地改革以后农民普遍多吃粮食等等需要增长的速度。如上海县闵行镇刚解放时只有七千人口，现在发展到三万一千多人，新建了好几个工厂，现有工人一万多；南京有一个工厂刚解放时只有六七十人，现在已有一千四百人，增加了二十倍。江苏省人口每年平均增加百分之二左右；人民生活也在不断地提高，而且是普遍地提高。解放前农村里只有少数地主、富农生活富裕，部分中农生活稍好一点；解放后经过土地改革和农业生产的发展，广大农民（特别是贫农）已经摆脱了封建剥削，改变了过去瓜菜半年粮的半饥饿的生活状况，粮食消费量普遍增加了。同时，经济作物种植面积的逐年扩大，也相对地减低了粮食的产量。江苏省棉花种植面积，一九五二年为九百五十五万亩，一九五四年增加到了一千零六十万亩。从这些情况来看，粮食不足的情况是难免的。但是，只是这些情况，是不足以引起像过去几个月那种程度的“紧张”的。粮食生产速度虽然比较慢，但也还是比过去增加了。
    去年，江苏遭受了百年来未有的洪水。在重灾地区，不但不能进行粮食统购，相反的还要供应他们粮食。去冬全省就有五百三十七个受灾乡，占总乡数百分之五，没有进行统购，而且这些乡多是高产量的水稻地区。部分轻灾区粮食统购任务也减轻了。在受灾地区，除供应口粮外，还供应了夏种种籽粮和修复圩堤时补贴民工的口粮，此外，春节后气候又不正常，徐州、淮阴专区的部分地区烂掉了很多山芋。这些都是需要增加粮食供应量的原因。可是，按照前述全省统购统销的数字来看，这个困难也不是不能克服的。
    是不是收购的粮食太多了呢？部分农民为了生活急需，暂时出卖了一部分口粮的情形是有的；统购中少数党员、团员、积极分子卖了“过头粮”的情形也是有的。但是，前一种情形，历来都是如此，短期内也难以避免，不能当作今年粮食一度
  “紧张”的原因；后一种情形，毕竟只是极少数，而且政府是可以保证补足他们所需要的粮食的，也不是一度特别“紧张”的主要原因。
    江苏省本年度粮食征购数字是大了一些，一部分乡留给农民的粮食数量确实是少了一些。全省一九五四年粮食产量不及一九五三年，而一九五四年粮食征购实绩基本与一九五三年相等。一九五三年是实行粮食统购统销的第一年，农民手中还有历年陈粮，同时去年灾区免购或减购的部分又加到非灾地区，这就使得非灾地区的统购任务显得更大了一些。但是，全省完成粮食征购任务情况是不平衡的，约有百分之十的乡统购不足。如松江专区是全省统购比较紧的地区，全专区五百四十五个乡中统购不足的仍有六十七个乡，占总乡数百分之十二点二九；约有百分之六十五到七十的乡统购是比较恰当的；约有百分之二十到二十五的乡统购是比较紧的（紧的程度也有不同，有些村并不紧，个别户也还有余粮没有卖足）。江宁县汤山镇李家庄计有农户三十九户，其中余粮户三十二户；据统购以后检查，余粮卖过头的有两户，余粮没有卖足的有一户。有部分乡村定产虽然有些偏高，但统购不足，实际上留粮也不紧。如江宁县阜东乡朱家山村，定产四百斤，计算应售余粮十一万斤，结果只购到了三万斤；沛县栖山乡计算应售余粮三十万斤，统购实绩为十三万七千斤。
    是不是供应的粮食太少了呢？三、四月份的供应量，按每人每天一斤算，等于供应了全省人口的百分之六十六，无论如何不能说是太少了。不过，江苏各地粮食统销工作做得是不平衡的，有些地方做得不够及时。各级领导工作人员对粮食统销工作的艰苦性认识不足，缺乏经常的督促检查，因此工作中存在的许多毛病没有得到及时纠正。有的地方发证工作潦草，错发了购粮证。有些地方发证时没有经过群众评议，乡村工作人员怕得罪人，认为“吵得凶，要得紧，顶得牢”的就是缺粮户，就盲目发给购粮证。有的把供应证上的数字写错了；有的供应证被涂改。泰兴县抒青区四月份突破供应计划九万斤，其中四万多斤就是属于涂改的。有的地方强调照顾“特殊情况”，基层工作人员随便打条子，增加临时供应。有的基层工作人员不会写字，就把空白供应证交给当过伪保长的人和地主、富农分子去填；这些人就从中舞弊。睢宁县洪庄乡伪人员把九户余粮户写成了缺粮户。有些地方供应了不记账，重复供应。也有些地方基层组织不纯，少数基层工作人员自私自利，甚至徇私舞弊，包庇地主、富农、反革命分子。这些是造成人为的“紧张”的主要原因之一。
    江苏省过去在工作中还有一个很大的缺点，就是在粮食统购统销中，对地主、富农、反革命分子的疯狂破坏估计不足，打击得不够。地主、富农、反革命分子在粮食征购销运动中破坏活动是很猖獗的。他们到处造谣，挑拨工农关系，拉拢群众。在粮食统销中仅一九五五年二月中旬到五月十日，全省各地地主、富农、反革命分子为首策动哄闹粮食事件即达一百六十四起，这些事件大多数是发生在土地改革和镇压反革命做得很不好的落后乡村。反革命分子煽动闹供应的口号，一般都是“谁不参加，谁就是有粮，我们就到谁家去吃！”此外地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏花样，还有装穷、叫苦、抢购熟食品、作黑市投机，以及小恩小惠贿赂干部、拉拢农民等等。总之，地主、富农、反革命分子破坏粮食统购统销工作是无所不用其极的，他们拚命地千方百计地找寻空隙，煽动群众，制造事件。这说明了在社会主义革命过程中，农村中的阶级斗争是十分尖锐、激烈的，但过去我们对这种情况的认识和分析是不够的，对反革命分子的破坏活动打击也是不够的。同时，许多地方对农民缺乏经常的教育，农民一方面有怀疑和顾虑，一方面不能识别阶级敌人的阴谋，有些人就上了敌人的当。因此也就增加了粮食问题的人为的“紧张”。
    巩固整顿粮食统销的成果
    江苏省整顿粮食统销工作，在城市方面，是从
  一月份就开始进行的。当时，中共江苏省委发出了加强城市粮食统销工作的指示，着重在城市人民中提倡节约粮食，反对浪费粮食，合理压缩城市粮食销量。在农村方面，从三月上旬就开始结合农业生产，进行整顿粮食统销工作和粮食“三定”工作；到五月底止，全省经过粮食统销补课的有九千一百四十九个乡，占总乡数百分之九十九点五；已公布粮食“三定”指标的有八千四百十八个乡，占总乡数百分之九十一点六。
    各地事实证明，农民群众是坚决拥护粮食统购统销政策的。他们在两年来国家实行粮食统购统销中亲身体会到它的好处；特别是在去年百年少有的大水后，粮价稳定如常，感觉尤为深刻。江宁县灾区群众说：民国二十年大水，农村有三变：米价飞涨，妻离子散，良田荒芜。今年是米价稳定、骨肉团圆，圩堤很快修复，一变也不变。江都县河东乡农民说：过去砖桥镇上有吴志德（粮食奸商），乡里有褚德禄（富农、放高利贷者），出卖粮食都要受他们剥削；要不是国家实行了统购统销，去年这样大水，今年粮商就要造反，富农就要剥农民的皮。在整顿统销工作中，许多地方向农民进行了教育，讲清楚国家粮食情况和粮食统销政策以后，许多农民都痛悔自己一时糊涂，上了富农、坏分子的当，认识到到处乱跑乱吵，耽误了生产，破坏粮食统销计划，对国家对自己都没有好处。在农民群众的社会主义觉悟提高后，他们决不愿意给国家制造困难，相反地，他们是愿意帮助国家合理地解决粮食供应问题的。
    经过粮食统销补课和粮食“三定”工作，使农民又一次受到深刻的社会主义教育，进一步了解国家的粮食情况，进一步懂得国家的粮食统购统销政策，消除了各种误会和顾虑。许多农民反映：“‘三定’一到，心中不跳。”“有了‘三定’，国家高兴，农民高兴，干部高兴。”“‘三定’定了心，国家有底好建设，农民有底好生产，干部有底好工作。”这就大大缓和了农民在粮食问题上的紧张心理，从而使各地供应面供应量都有了不同程度的缩小，一般比农民原来要求的粮食供应数字下降百分之二十到三十，达到了供应上的基本合理。同时，中央在三、四两月又补充给江苏省一部分统销粮食。许多统购粮食较多、留粮较紧的乡，都在整顿统销工作中解决了一部分农民口粮的困难，实际上也就是退还了一部分粮食给那些卖了“过头粮”的农民。
    现在，江苏省粮食供应数字，已经足以适应全省人民对粮食的需要。再加上麦子已经收割，缺粮的农户接上了口粮，这就使农村粮食情况更趋稳定。只是一熟田和晚稻地区以及少数去秋因积水未种下麦子的地区，还须继续抓紧做好粮食统销补课工作。全省各地现正结合夏收夏种，在粮食“三定”的基础上，合理地分配第三季度粮食销售指标；在充分做好准备工作以后，按乡向群众公布第三季度粮食销售数字，以保证控制指标，不被突破。同时，城市粮食统销偏宽的现象，也正根据中共中央和国务院的指示，结合当地情况，采取有效措施，继续坚决地加以扭转，以进一步巩固前一时期整顿粮食统销工作的成果。
