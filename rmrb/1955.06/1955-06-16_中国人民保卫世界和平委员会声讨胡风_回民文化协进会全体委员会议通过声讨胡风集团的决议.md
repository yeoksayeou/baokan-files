Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: The China Peace Committee held a general staff meeting on June 13th and 14th to denounce the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

    Liu Guan-yi, Secretary-General of the China Peace Committee, made a mobilization report at the meeting. He said that the materials published in the newspapers have irrefutably proven that the members of the Hu Feng group are counter-revolutionaries who have been lurking within us for a long time, carrying out various conspiracies. They are our most insidious and ferocious enemies. Their ulterior motive is to attempt to restore the overthrown reactionary rule in our country. In order to guarantee the victory of our socialist cause and to protect the peaceful and happy life of our people, we must resolutely eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

    Many speakers at the meeting denounced the various counter-revolutionary acts of the Hu Feng group. Everyone indignantly pointed out that the Hu Feng group members secretly and wantonly slandered our great Communist Party and the people, and maliciously attacked and absurdly and shamelessly insulted Guo Moruo, Chairman of the association, and many progressive writers who have made important contributions to literary creation and the world peace movement. This fully shows that they are the deadly enemies of all the people. Everyone demanded that the people's government severely punish this group of counter-revolutionaries.

    In the end, everyone unanimously expressed that they would strengthen theoretical study, raise revolutionary vigilance, conscientiously do their own work, and thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng group and all counter-revolutionaries.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: The Second Plenary Committee (Enlarged) Meeting of the China Islamic Cultural Association, currently being held in Beijing, passed a resolution denouncing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

    The resolution stated: All the committee members and representatives attending the meeting resolutely demand a thorough reckoning of the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and severe punishment according to the law.

    The resolution stated: The exposure of this counter-revolutionary conspiratorial group once again reminds us that we must be vigilant, expose all enemies lurking in the revolutionary ranks at any time, and eliminate them in order to strengthen national unity, consolidate the revolutionary regime, and strive to build our great and lovable motherland.

    最后大家一致表示，要加强理论学习，提高革命警惕性，认真作好自己的工作，彻底肃清胡风集团和一切反革命分子。
