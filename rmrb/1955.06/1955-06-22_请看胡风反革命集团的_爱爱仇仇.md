Let's Look at the "Loves and Hates" of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
	Liu Jin

Hu Feng had a favorite saying: "Loves and hates." What exactly did they love? What did they hate? Let's look at the facts!

First, they hated the Party, hated the Party's cause, and hated the revolutionary people. In the summer of 1951, this counter-revolutionary clique, under the protection and support of Liu Xuewei, launched a fierce attack on the Party. At this time, Hu Feng element Luo Shi (i.e., Zhang Zhongxiao), singing the same tune as his master Hu Feng, gnashed his teeth and slandered the Party's literary and artistic thought as "mechanical forces," "insisting on political correctness," and "using it to slaughter everything."

Later, Luo Shi's reactionary remarks were criticized in "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette). For this counter-revolutionary clique, this was truly adding new hatred to old (they had already hated "Wenyi Bao" to the bone after it criticized Hu Feng's long poem in 1950). Luo Shi, like a shrew cursing in the street, said to his cronies: "Those things," "are incompetent and despicable, nothing could be worse than this." The sound of gnashing teeth truly overflowed in his words!

Zhang Zhongxiao once confessed to Luo Luo in this counter-revolutionary clique that he "went to Sichuan in 1947 and met a friend." He connected with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique through the introduction of this "friend." But later, this "friend" "changed," and he "tried to persuade him" but failed. Thus, he "ended his friendship" with this "friend." He also yelped that this "friend" "was only intoxicated in the 'revolutionary ranks,' worshiping idols and authority, and drowned in collective life." — Look, how firm is this Hu Feng element's counter-revolutionary stance!

It was precisely because of Zhang Zhongxiao's counter-revolutionary fervor and determination that Hu Feng and Liu Xuewei regarded him as a treasure in their palms. Liu Xuewei couldn't wait to bring him out from his hometown in Shaoxing, and arranged for him to go to the New Literature and Art Publishing House, making him a general guarding the gate. Under the promotion of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, this Hu Feng element, who had just mixed into the revolutionary ranks, rose rapidly and became a "cadre" of grade twelve (referring to the level in the publishing industry - the author)!

What is hateful is that such examples are by no means unique!

Another Hu Feng element, Hang Xing (i.e., Luo Fei), served in the reactionary army for a long time before liberation, and worked as a clerk in the First Labor Hospital after liberation. Because he had joined Hu Feng in 1947 and done many things for Hu Feng, he also received the appreciation of Liu Xuewei. As soon as Liu Xuewei arrived at the Literature and Art Section of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, he transferred Hang Xing there; then he brought him to the New Literature and Art Publishing House and promoted him to editor. Later, during the "Three-Anti" campaign, it was found that Hang Xing had serious errors such as corruption and concealing his history and was expelled from the Party, but Liu Xuewei ignored the Party's organizational principles, took matters into his own hands, changed the expulsion from the Party to probation within the Party; and at the conference announcing the punishment, shamelessly "represented the Party" and apologized to Hang Xing! That "care" had truly reached the extreme.

Another example is Luo Luo, one of the Hu Feng elements. When Luo Luo was at the Youth Daily, his thinking was backward and his style was bad, so he couldn't gain a foothold among the masses. At this time, Liu Xuewei's meticulous care for the Hu Feng elements was once again demonstrated, and he pulled Luo Luo from the Youth Daily to the Literature and Art Section without going through the organization, promoted him several levels, and placed him in an important position. What's even stranger is that Luo Luo, who was considered to have backward thinking and a bad style by the masses at the Youth Daily, was admitted to the Party not long after arriving at the New Literature and Art Publishing House controlled by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

From the above facts, it is not difficult for us to see what the boundary and the principle of the "loves and hates" of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique are!

Below, I would like to talk about the "loves and hates" of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in dealing with writers and works. First, let's talk about their "loves."

In the spring of 1954, the New Literature and Art Publishing House published Lu Li's poetry collection "Song of the Stars." From the ideological content, this collection of poems is individualistic; from the creative method, it is subjectivistic. These poems had already been criticized at the time of writing (around 1942). But such poems were loved to death by Hu Feng elements A Long, Zhang Zhongxiao, Luo Luo, Geng Yong, and others, and they spared no effort in collecting the best adjectives to tout it. Tearing down the mask, it turns out that this is what happened: First, Lu Li is a member of their counter-revolutionary clique; second, the collection contains the group of poems "—to the Wind", like feudal literati dedicating eulogies to the emperor, the servants could not but applaud loudly; third, these poems used creative practice to support and develop the reactionary poetic theories of Hu Feng and A Long, and faithfully promoted Hu Feng's reactionary thoughts.

To give another example, Hu Feng element Lu Dian's play "Women's Woes" was criticized by "Renmin Xiju" (People's Drama) after it was published in "Tianjin Wenyi" (Tianjin Literature and Art). No matter which aspect you look at it from, that play is very inferior. But the Hu Feng clique insisted on praising it blindly. First of all, A Long introduced this play to the Hu Feng elements of the New Literature and Art Publishing House, saying: "Brother Dian's play 'Women's Woes' is quite good. Although it has been criticized, first of all, that criticism is ignorant and bad." He instructed that it could be published under the name "Second Spring." The Hu Feng elements of the New Literature and Art Publishing House obeyed the order with caution, and as soon as they received this play, they praised it to the thirty-third heaven; and from Mei Lin, the deputy editor-in-chief and director of the first editorial office, to editors Luo Luo and Zhang Zhongxiao, they formed a united front to publish this play.

There are many more examples in this regard, but that is enough. Below, let's take a look at their "hates."

There is a collection of soldiers' poems "We Fight in Korea." Hu Feng element Zhang Zhongxiao impatiently did not even bother to read it clearly (which can be proved by the fact that he quoted the words of the original poem incorrectly) and wrote "written very poorly," rejecting it with one blow.

Zhi Xia's "Railway Guerrilla," has now become a more popular book with readers, but the Hu Feng elements of the New Literature and Art Publishing House slandered it in every possible way because it was written about the story of revolutionary struggle.

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique particularly disliked works that coordinated with political tasks. Zhang Zhongxiao wrote on a review opinion paper for a collection of poems: "These are poems by the author to coordinate with the movement, most of them are not good, vulgar, such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries." Why is writing about "suppressing counter-revolutionaries" bad and vulgar? Now it is very clear, precisely because the Hu Feng clique itself is a counter-revolutionary clique that should be suppressed.

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique also strongly disliked works depicting the outstanding qualities of advanced figures. There is a novel entitled "When Parting with Companions", which describes a worker who volunteers to resist the United States and aid Korea, gets a day off before departure, goes home to say goodbye, first goes to the factory to say goodbye, sees the workers repairing a machine very intensely, is attracted, and joins the work, forgetting to go home. The Hu Feng elements criticized this novel as "having no contradictions, no conflicts, no backward ideas and backward figures, having a tendency towards the theory of no conflict." It turns out that this is not a question of whether there is conflict, but that they advocate exaggerating our backwardness, and they hate our progress to the core.

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique also despised new forces. A long poem submitted by a twenty-year-old young author was only pointed out by Hu Feng element Zhang Zhongxiao as "the author often uses some general metaphors and phrases, general plot," and then he wrote: "The poem selection is full, no need." — How could the poem selection be "full"? It turned out that all of it was seized by Lu Li, Lv Yuan, Ji Fang and other Hu Feng elements acting in collusion from inside and outside.

All these facts irrefutably illustrate the true content of the "loves and hates" of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique: what they love is counter-revolutionary actions, and what they hate is revolutionary cause. Isn't this an ironclad fact?

    请看胡风反革命集团的“爱爱仇仇”
    刘金
    胡风有一句口头禅，叫做“爱爱仇仇”。究竟他们爱什么？仇什么？请看事实！
    首先，他们仇恨党、仇恨党的事业、仇恨革命人民。一九五一年夏天，这个反革命集团在刘雪苇的包庇和支持下，向党展开了猛烈的攻击。这时，胡风分子罗石（即张中晓），同他的主子胡风唱着同一的曲调，咬牙切齿地诬蔑党的文艺思想是“机械论底势力”，“硬要政治性”，“用来屠杀一切”。
    后来，罗石的反动言论在“文艺报”上受到了批评。这对于这个反革命集团说来，真是旧恨加上了新仇（“文艺报”在一九五○年批评了胡风的长诗以后，他们就已经恨之入骨了的）。罗石像王婆骂街似地对他底党羽说道：“那些东西们”，“低能并下流，未有甚于此的”。那咬牙切齿之声，真是溢于言表！
    张中晓曾向这个反革命集团里的罗洛表白说，他“四七年到四川，碰到了一个朋友”，他由于这个“朋友”的介绍而和胡风反革命集团接上了关系。但后来，他的这个“朋友”“不然了”，他“想说服他”，可是没有成功。于是，他就同这个“朋友”“结束了友谊”。他并且狺狺地说，这个“朋友”“只不过陶醉在‘革命队伍’里，崇拜偶像和权威，在集体生活中沉没了”。——看吧，这个胡风分子的反革命立场，是多么坚定啊！
    正是由于张中晓的反革命的狂热和坚决，使得胡风和刘雪苇把他当成了掌上明珠。刘雪苇迫不及待地把他从绍兴老家接了出来，把他安插到新文艺出版社去，做了一员把守关口的大将。在胡风反革命集团的抬举下，这个刚混进革命队伍的胡风分子居然平步青云，一下子成了一个十二级（系出版界的级别——笔者）的“干部”！
    可恨的是，这样的例子决不是只有一个！
    另一个胡风分子杭行（即罗飞），解放前长期在反动军队里服务，解放后在第一劳工医院里做一个事务员。由于他在一九四七年就投靠了胡风，替胡风做了许多事，因而也得到了刘雪苇的赏识。刘雪苇一到中共中央华东局宣传部文艺处，就把杭行调去；随后又把他带到新文艺出版社，并且擢升为编辑。后来，在“三反”中，查明杭行有贪污、隐瞒历史等严重错误而被开除出党，但是刘雪苇竟蔑视党的组织原则，自做主张，把开除出党改为留党察看；并且在宣布处分的大会上，无耻地“代表党”向杭行道歉！那“爱护”，真是到了极点。
    还有一个例子，那就是胡风分子之一的罗洛。罗洛在青年报社时，思想落后、作风恶劣，因而在群众中站不住脚。这时，又表现了刘雪苇对胡风分子的爱护备至，竟然不通过组织，硬把罗洛从青年报社拉到文艺处，连升数级，加以重用。更奇怪的是，在青年报社被群众认为思想落后、作风恶劣的罗洛，到了胡风反革命集团所把持的新文艺出版社不久，竟被吸收入党了。
    从以上的事实中，我们不难看出，胡风反革命集团的“爱爱仇仇”，那界线，那原则，究竟是什么！
    下面，我想再谈谈胡风反革命集团的“爱爱仇仇”在对待作家和作品方面的表现。首先谈谈他们的“爱爱”。
    一九五四年春，新文艺出版社出版了鲁藜的诗集“星的歌”。这本诗集，从思想内容上说，是个人主义的；从创作方法上说，是主观主义的。这些诗，在写作的当时（一九四二年前后），就已经受到过一些批评。但这样的诗，却被胡风分子阿垅、张中晓、罗洛、耿庸等人爱煞了，他们不遗余力地搜集了最好的形容词来吹嘘它。拆穿西洋镜，原来是这么一回事：一、鲁藜是他们这个反革命集团的一员；二、集子里有着“—给风”的组诗，好像封建文人献给皇上的歌功颂德的文章，臣仆们是没有不大声叫好的；三、这些诗是用创作实践拥护了和发挥了胡风、阿垅们的反动的诗歌理论的，是忠实地宣扬了胡风的反动思想的。
    再举一个例子，胡风分子芦甸的剧本“女难”，在“天津文艺”发表后就受到了“人民戏剧”的批评。那剧本，无论从那一方面看，都是十分低劣的。但胡风集团那一伙人，却硬要闭起眼睛来瞎捧。首先是阿垅把这剧本介绍给新文艺出版社的胡风分子，说：“甸兄剧本‘女难’，相当好。虽然受过批评，首先却是那批评底无知与恶劣。”他指示可“改名‘第二个春天’”出版。新文艺出版社的胡风分子奉命唯谨，一接到这剧本，就把它捧上了三十三重天；并且从副总编辑兼第一编辑室主任的梅林到编辑罗洛、张中晓结成一气，使这个剧本出版了。
    这方面的例子还有很多，但已经够了。下面，我们再来看一看他们的“仇仇”吧。
    有一本战士诗集“我们战斗在朝鲜”，胡风分子张中晓很不耐烦地连看也没有看清楚（这从他引错了原诗的字句就可证明）就批道“写得很不好”，一棍子就把它打了回去。
    知侠的“铁道游击队”，现在已经成为读者较欢迎的一本书了，可是新文艺出版社的胡风分子因为它写的是革命斗争的故事，就百般地诋毁它。
    胡风反革命集团特别厌恶配合政治任务的作品。张中晓在一本诗集的审阅意见纸上写道：“是作者配合运动的诗，大部分不好，庸俗，如镇压反革命之类。”为什么写“镇压反革命之类”是不好和庸俗的呢？现在已很明白了，正因为胡风集团本身就是一个应该被镇压的反革命集团。
    胡风反革命集团同样十分厌恶描写先进人物优秀品质的作品。有一篇题为“和伙伴们分手的时候”的小说，描写一个志愿抗美援朝的工人，出发前得到一天假期，回家去告别，他先到工厂里去告别，看见工人兄弟们正在非常紧张地修理一部机器，他被吸引了，也加入工作，竟忘记了回家。胡风分子竟批评这篇小说“没有矛盾，没有冲突，没有落后思想和落后人物，有无冲突论的倾向”。原来这并不是有无冲突的问题，而是他们主张要大事渲染我们落后的一面，他们对我们的进步是恨透了。
    胡风反革命集团对于新生力量也是蔑视的。有一个二十岁的青年作者投来一首长诗，胡风分子张中晓仅仅指出了“作者往往用一些一般的比喻和词句，一般的故事情节”这一缺点以后，批道：“诗选题已满，不用。”——诗选题怎么会“已满”的呢？原来全部被鲁藜、绿原、冀汸等胡风分子里应外合地抢占了。
    所有这些事实，都无可辩驳地说明了胡风反革命集团的“爱爱仇仇”的真实内容：他们所爱的是反革命的勾当，他们所仇的是革命的事业。难道这不是铁的事实吗？
