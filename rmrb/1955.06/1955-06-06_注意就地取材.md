    Pay Attention to Using Local Materials
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    The Xi'an area is crisscrossed by rivers and dotted with mountains, containing vast amounts of natural materials that can be used for construction. In the Chan River, Feng River, and ? River near Xi'an City, there are abundant pebbles and sand that can be used for concrete; on Mount Cuihua, more than fifty *li* south of Xi'an City, white stones are clearly visible on the rocks, which are indispensable materials for making terrazzo.
    The quality of the pebbles here is generally very good. According to the results of tests conducted by the Materials Testing Institute of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau, concrete made with pebbles can withstand a pressure of 170 kilograms per square centimeter, which is entirely suitable for reinforced concrete projects. The Northwest Textile Industry Administration has used these pebbles in its factory construction with good results.
    The price of pebbles is also very cheap, two-thirds to three-quarters cheaper than using artificial or machine-crushed stone chips. The Materials Company of the Northwest Engineering Administration once calculated that 1.5 to 2.5 cm stone chips produced in Lianhua Temple cost 33 yuan per cubic meter (including transportation costs, the same below), while using pebbles costs no more than 10 yuan per cubic meter, including processing fees; 2 to 4 cm stone chips produced in Lianhua Temple cost 18 yuan per cubic meter; while using pebbles costs 8.5 yuan per cubic meter. The bureau needs a total of 77,000 cubic meters of stone chips for several projects in the eastern suburbs of Xi'an this year, and if pebbles are used instead, 1.3 million yuan can be saved. The bureau's construction tasks for 1956 will increase many times over, so the demand for stone chips will also increase. According to preliminary calculations, more than 400,000 cubic meters of stone chips will be needed for the whole year. If pebbles can be used for all of them, how much money will be saved for the country! Moreover, the production of the Lianhua Temple stone chip factory is limited and cannot meet the needs of construction projects in the Xi'an area, causing the material supply department to worry about the stone chip problem all day long. If pebbles are used, the needs of the project will be fully guaranteed.
    Given the above-mentioned advantages of pebbles, there should be no problem in replacing stone chips with pebbles. However, this is not the case. The method of using pebbles is still not feasible in some construction departments and design personnel, especially the personnel in the construction departments. They cannot find a scientific basis and stubbornly claim that "the use of pebbles does not meet the design requirements" and "cannot guarantee the quality of the project," etc., to oppose the use of pebbles. For example, the Basic Construction Department of the Northwest Electric Power Bureau is like this. Their project is near the Chan River, and the construction project of the neighboring state-owned Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Factory is using a large number of pebbles. When the construction unit sent representatives to discuss the issue of using pebbles with them, they insisted on not using pebbles. Despite the construction unit's guarantee of the quality of the project and explanations that this would save a lot of money for the country, they still refused, believing that only stone chips can be used for concrete projects.
    In the design departments, when design personnel design concrete projects, they only think of artificial and machine-crushed stone chips. They do not believe that pebbles can guarantee the quality of the project.
    In addition, many personnel in basic construction departments have not conducted investigations and tests on white stones, but they are adamant that the quality of the white stones on Mount Cuihua is not good. Therefore, the white stones used here have to be purchased from other places. Last year alone, the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau purchased 100 tons of white stones from places such as the Liuli River, with an average price of more than 31 yuan per ton higher than the stones from Mount Cuihua. Isn't this a waste?
    Using local materials is one of the effective measures to reduce costs in construction enterprises. This issue should attract the attention of the leaders of basic construction departments. In order to effectively implement the measure of using local materials, on the one hand, it is necessary to educate the personnel who oppose the use of local materials and correct their conservative ideas and bureaucratic style. On the other hand, there should also be a dedicated organization responsible for investigating the natural building materials in various places, finding out their reserves, and making correct test results so that they can be used in construction projects. At present, if it is difficult to conduct a comprehensive investigation, this work should first be carried out in those areas where construction has already started or is about to start. This will be of great benefit to the construction of our motherland.

### 注意就地取材

    注意就地取材
    本报记者　朱波
    西安地区，河流纵横，山峦连绵，到处都蕴藏了大量可供建筑用的天然材料。在西安市附近的滻河、沣河和?河里，有丰富的可做混凝土用的卵石和砂；在西安市南面五十多华里的翠华山上，白石子明摆在岩石上，它是做水磨石不可缺少的材料。
    这里的卵石质量一般都很好。根据西北工程管理总局材料试验所试验的结果，用卵石做的混凝土每平方公分可以承受一百七十公斤的压力，完全可以用来做钢筋混凝土工程。西北纺织工业管理局在建厂中采用过这种卵石，效果很好。
    卵石的价格也非常便宜，比起用人工石碴和机轧石碴便宜三分之二到四分之三之多。西北工程管理局材料公司曾算过一笔账，莲花寺出产的一点五至二点五公分的石碴，每立方合三十三元（包括运费在内，下同），采用卵石每立方包括加工费也不超过十元；莲花寺出产的二至四公分石碴，每立方合一十八元；采用卵石每立方合八元五角。该局在西安市东郊几项工程上，今年共需要七万七千立方石碴，如果改用卵石可以节省一百三十万元。该局一九五六年的建筑任务将要增加很多倍，因此石碴的需要量也增多了，据初步计算全年需要四十余万立方石碴，如果都能采用卵石，将会给国家节省多少资金啊！而且莲花寺石碴厂生产有限，供应不上西安地区建筑工程上的需要，使得材料供应部门整天为石碴问题发愁。如果采用卵石就会完全保证工程的需要。
    根据上述卵石的种种优点，以卵石代替石碴，应该说不会有什么问题了吧。但是，事实并不如此。采用卵石的办法在某些建筑部门和设计人员中还行不通，特别是建筑部门的人员，他们找不到科学根据，硬说“采用卵石不合乎设计要求”，“不能保证工程的质量”等来反对采用卵石。例如西北电业局基本建设处就是这样。他们的工程就在滻河附近，而且邻近的国营西北第四棉纺织厂的建厂工程，正在大量地采用卵石。施工单位派代表去同他们商量采用卵石的问题时，他们坚持不用卵石。尽管施工单位提出保证工程的质量，说明这样会给国家节省很多资金等等理由，他们仍然不答应，认为只有石碴才能做混凝土工程。
    在设计部门，设计人员一设计到混凝土工程时，想到的也只有人工石碴和机轧石碴，他们也不相信卵石能够保证工程的质量。
    此外，很多基本建设部门的人员对白石子没有进行过调查和试验，但是，他们却一口咬定说翠华山的白石子质量不好，因此，这里用白石子，就不得不向外地采购。去年，仅西北工程管理总局就从琉璃河等地采购了一百吨白石子，平均每吨比翠华山的石子贵三十一元以上。这不是浪费吗？
    就地取材是建筑企业中降低成本的有效措施之一。这个问题应该引起基本建设部门的领导人员注意。为了能够有效地贯彻就地取材的措施，一方面要教育反对就地取材的工作人员，纠正他们的保守思想和官僚主义作风，另一方面，还应该有一个专门负责的机构，负责对各地的天然建筑材料进行调查工作，找出它们的蕴藏量，并做出正确的试验结果，以便供应建筑工程采用。目前，如果进行全面的调查工作有困难，就首先在那些已经开工和将要开工的地区进行这项工作。这样对我们祖国的建设事业会有很大的好处。
