    Dulles' Provocation
    Jiang Yuanchun
    At the tenth anniversary meeting of the United Nations, Dulles vented the deep hatred of the American aggressors towards the Chinese people. In that speech aimed at exacerbating tensions and promoting a policy of "strength," he played the role of a "brave" coward, turning the peaceful platform of the commemorative meeting into a place of provocation, and unscrupulously slandering the Chinese people with the same old tricks.
    Dulles cranked up his antiquated "Cold War" record, slandering China for "aggression" in Korea, "abetting" "aggression" in Indochina, and having so-called "ambitions" towards the Taiwan area. However, he avoided talking about how the United States planned and launched the American war of aggression against Korea. To arrange this war, Dulles himself inspected the trenches of South Korea along the 38th parallel. He should have seen that it was the United States that sent troops from thousands of miles away to Korea to attack the Korean people and directly threaten China's security. He also knew that the Chinese people only rose up to resist America and aid Korea and defend our homes and country when the American aggressor troops reached our border. But he dared not talk about these things. He also avoided talking about why the Indochinese people resisting colonialists on their own territory could be considered a kind of "aggression," while the United States actively interfering in the Indochinese people's struggle for national independence was not aggression. Dulles dared not explain why the Chinese people's legitimate demand to liberate their own territory of Taiwan could be considered a kind of "ambition," because by explaining it, he would have to expose the truth himself: the United States occupied China's territory of Taiwan and intended to occupy it for a long time.
    This slander of the Chinese people by Dulles is not surprising at all. It has long been no secret that the United States is very interested in Korea, Taiwan, and Indochina, which are close to the Chinese mainland, for the purpose of invading China. Dulles already admitted it himself at the Bangkok conference of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in February this year, saying that the United States wanted to use these three places as "springboards" to deal with the Chinese people from "three fronts."
    This American conspiracy to attack the Chinese people from three fronts has been actively carried out since the founding of the People's Republic of China. That is why the United States launched a war in Korea less than a year after the founding of the People's Republic of China, and at the same time immediately announced the occupation of Taiwan and expanded interference in Indochina. But to the great dismay of the American aggressor group: they underestimated the strength of the people of Korea, China, and Indochina. The Korean War ended in the defeat of the American aggressor troops. The conspiracy to expand interference in Indochina failed to prevent the restoration of peace in Indochina. The act of occupying Taiwan is also facing the unwavering determination of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and the strong condemnation of world opinion.
    However, the American aggressor group has not learned anything from these lessons. As Molotov pointed out at the UN commemorative meeting: "It is only because the people's democratic revolution has triumphed in China, only because the great Chinese people have embarked on the road of building socialism," that Dulles and other American aggressors refuse to allow the People's Republic of China to obtain its legitimate rights in the United Nations. We should say that it is also for this reason that they are always unwilling to give up on the Chinese people. The United States' slander of China is to cover up the failure of the United States' aggression against Korea, Taiwan, and Indochina, and also to create excuses for the United States to further invade these places and prepare for new wars. Dulles' words at the Bangkok conference and the aggressive activities that the United States is now stepping up in these three regions fully prove this point.
    Dulles' vicious slander of the Chinese people at the UN commemorative meeting is an attempt to show the irreconcilable hatred of the American aggressors towards the Chinese people, to cooperate with the American conspiracy to intensify tensions worldwide, and to obstruct the easing of tensions in the Far East. This is the provocative answer of the American aggressors to the Asian people who demand the easing of tensions in the Far East and the Taiwan region.
    But, if anyone is so arrogant as to think that the increasingly powerful People's Republic of China can tolerate aggression, and that the Asian people's desire to ease the situation in the Far East can be ignored, then they are bound to receive an even heavier lesson!

    杜勒斯挑衅
    蒋元椿
    杜勒斯在联合国十周年纪念会上发泄了美国侵略分子对中国人民的深仇大恨。他在那个旨在加剧紧张局势，宣扬“实力”政策的演说中，充当了一个“勇敢”的懦夫的角色，把纪念会的和平讲坛，变成了一个挑衅的场所，对中国人民进行了肆无忌惮的老一套的诬蔑。
    杜勒斯开动他那张陈旧不堪的“冷战”唱片，诬蔑中国“侵略”了朝鲜，“助长”了在印度支那发生的“侵略”，对台湾地区有所谓“野心”。然而他却避而不谈美国怎样布置和发动美国侵略朝鲜的战争，为了布置这场战争，杜勒斯曾经亲自巡视了南朝鲜在三八线上的战壕。他应该看到，是美国把军队从几千英里外派到朝鲜来向朝鲜人民进攻，并且直接威胁中国的安全。他也明知中国人民是在美国侵略军打到我国边境的时候，我们才奋起抗美援朝、保家卫国。但是这些他都不敢讲。他也避而不谈为什么印度支那人民在自己的领土上抵抗殖民主义者竟然算是一种“侵略”，而美国积极干涉印度支那人民争取民族独立的斗争反倒不是侵略。杜勒斯不敢说明，为什么中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的正当要求可以算是一种“野心”，因为一加说明，他就不能不自己揭穿真相：美国侵占了中国的领土台湾，并且打算长期侵占下去。
    杜勒斯对中国人民的这种诬蔑一点也不令人奇怪。美国对于贴近中国大陆的朝鲜、台湾和印度支那十分有兴趣，就是为了侵略中国，这早已不是什么秘密。杜勒斯在今年二月间东南亚条约国家的曼谷会议上就已经不打自招地说过，美国要利用这三个地方作为“跳板”，从“三条战线”上来对付中国人民。
    美国这种从三条战线上进攻中国人民的阴谋，从中华人民共和国成立的时候起就已经积极进行了。这也就是为什么中华人民共和国成立还不到一年，美国就在朝鲜发动了战争，同时立刻宣布侵占台湾、扩大干涉印度支那。但是使美国侵略集团极为伤心的是：他们低估了朝鲜、中国和印度支那人民的力量。朝鲜战争以美国侵略军的失败而告终。扩大干涉印度支那的阴谋没有能够阻挠印度支那和平的恢复。侵占台湾的行为也正面对着中国人民解放台湾的不可动摇的决心和世界舆论的强烈谴责。
    然而美国侵略集团并没有从这些教训学到什么。正如莫洛托夫在联合国纪念会上所指出的：“只是因为人民民主革命在中国获得了胜利，只是因为伟大的中国人民走上了建设社会主义的道路”，所以杜勒斯等美国侵略分子等不让中华人民共和国在联合国取得自己的合法权利。我们应该说，也只是因为这个原故，所以他们对中国人民总是不肯善罢干休。美国对中国的诬蔑，是为了掩饰美国侵略朝鲜、台湾和印度支那的失败，同时也是为了替美国进一步侵略这些地方、进行新战争的准备制造借口。杜勒斯在曼谷会议上所说的话，和美国现在在这三个地区加紧进行的侵略活动，都充分证明了这一点。
    杜勒斯在联合国纪念会上恶毒地诬蔑中国人民，是企图表明美国侵略分子对于中国人民的不可和解的仇恨，配合美国在世界范围内加剧紧张局势的阴谋，阻挠远东紧张局势的缓和。这也就是美国侵略分子对于要求缓和远东和台湾地区紧张局势的亚洲人民的挑衅性的回答。
    但是，如果有谁竟然狂妄到以为日益强大的中华人民共和国是可以容忍侵略的、亚洲人民的缓和远东局势的愿望是可以被漠视的，那末，他就必然要受到更沉重的教训！
