    Indian Cultural Delegation Visits and Tours Lüda
    (Our dispatch from Lüda, 20th) The Indian Cultural Delegation is currently visiting and touring the city of Lüda.
    At 10:00 a.m. on the 20th, the Indian Cultural Delegation visited the Lüda Workers' Sanatorium. Staff at the sanatorium picked roses in full bloom and presented them to the Indian dancers. When the delegation members visited the medical room, construction workers Yang Shuxiang and Yuan Zhaojia were receiving paraffin wax therapy and electrotherapy. The delegation members gave them roses and said "Ni hao!" in Chinese. Some convalescing workers were playing table tennis, and the delegation members joined them. The delegation members said they were most pleased to see some photos taken during Premier Zhou's visit to India. Upon leaving, Mr. Chettiar shook the hand of Jin Henli, the vice-president of the sanatorium, and said, "You have done a lot of work in this area. I will definitely take the impressions I have gained back to India."
    Subsequently, the delegation members visited seven workshops of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant to observe the production situation. They stayed in the iron foundry for a long time. One delegate, seeing the red-hot castings, gave a thumbs up and said, "Very good, very good!"
    At 2:30 p.m., the delegation members went to Lushun for a visit. On Baiyu Mountain, the delegation members overlooked the panorama of Lushun. At the Lushun Museum, the delegation members saw the model of the seismograph invented by Zhang Heng, a great astronomer in our country more than 1,820 years ago, the mechanical compass model of Ma Jun of the Three Kingdoms period, and the model of the "Li Ji Gu Che" (distance-measuring drum cart) of the Jin Dynasty. When Mr. Chettiar saw the large bowl with chrysanthemum petal patterns printed on Longquan kiln ware from the Ming Dynasty, he said excitedly, "There is also such a porcelain in the Hyderabad Museum in India. He said that it was a gift from a Chinese emperor to the Mughal emperor of India." They also saw a natural mummy discovered in Xinjiang. Before leaving, Mr. Chettiar said, "Although the time is short, it is very interesting to see. Next time I come, I must look more carefully." At the entrance of the museum, a large group of people who had been waiting for a long time gathered and warmly applauded the delegation members.
    At 8:00 p.m., the delegation gave a performance for the people of Lüda at the Lüda People's Cultural Club, which was warmly welcomed.

    印度文化代表团在旅大游览访问
    本报旅大二十日电  印度文化代表团正在旅大市游览访问。
    二十日上午十时，印度文化代表团去参观旅大市工人疗养院。院里的工作人员采了正在盛开的玫瑰花送给印度的舞蹈家。代表们到医疗室参观时，建筑工人杨书香和袁肇佳正进行腊疗、电疗，代表们就把玫瑰花送给他们，并用中国话说：“你好！”另外一些疗养工人正打乒乓球，代表们就同他们一起打球。代表们说，他们最高兴的是，他们在这里看到了周总理访问印度时拍的一些照片。离开时，钱达先生握着疗养院副院长金痕里的手说：“你们在这方面做了许多工作。我一定把所得到的印象带回印度去。”
    随着，代表们参观了大连机车车辆制造厂的七个车间的生产情况。他们在铸铁车间停留很久。一位代表看到火红的铸件，伸出大拇指说：“真好，真好！”
    下午二时半，代表们去旅顺参观。在白玉山上，代表们眺望了旅顺的全景。在旅顺博物馆，代表们看到了一千八百二十多年前我国伟大天文学家张衡发明的地动仪模型，三国时马钧的机械指南模型，以及晋朝劳动人民的“记里鼓车”的模型。当钱达先生看到明代龙泉窑印花菊瓣纹大碗时，兴奋地说：“在印度海地拉巴博物馆也有这样一个瓷器。他说：那是中国一位皇帝送给印度莫格尔朝皇帝的。”他们还看了在新疆发现的一个自然木乃伊。临走时，钱达先生说：“时间虽然很短，看得很有意思。下一次来，一定要看得更仔细。”在博物馆门口，聚集了早已等着的一大群人，他们热烈地鼓掌欢迎代表们。
    晚八时，代表团在旅大市人民文化俱乐部，为旅大市人民演出，受到了热烈欢迎。
