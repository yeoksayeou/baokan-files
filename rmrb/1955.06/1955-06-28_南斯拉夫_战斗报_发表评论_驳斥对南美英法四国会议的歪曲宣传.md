Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, June 24th: The Yugoslav newspaper "Borba" published a commentary on the 21st, refuting the distorted propaganda in London's "Observer" regarding the ambassador-level representatives meeting of Yugoslavia, the United States, Britain, and France scheduled to be held in Belgrade on the 24th. The London "Observer" said: Yugoslavia is trying to use its position to make negotiations between the West and Russia difficult; and that Yugoslavia has reported the situation of its talks with the Soviet delegation to the Western ambassadors. "Borba" pointed out that this statement is a complete fabrication. Yugoslavia is an independent country, and has not reported to anyone in the past or present.

"Borba" said that the ambassador-level representatives meeting of Yugoslavia, the United States, Britain, and France will discuss the international situation and mutual relations, and it is only a meeting for free and equal exchange of opinions. If anyone imagines or interprets the upcoming negotiations differently - such as the "Observer" - saying that this meeting should decide Yugoslavia's relationship with the West, and should persuade Yugoslavia to believe that it is necessary to change its policies, then he has not understood the basic purpose of the Belgrade meeting.

### 南斯拉夫“战斗报”发表评论  驳斥对南美英法四国会议的歪曲宣传

    南斯拉夫“战斗报”发表评论
    驳斥对南美英法四国会议的歪曲宣传
    新华社二十四日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫“战斗报”二十一日发表评论，驳斥伦敦“观察家报”对定于二十四日在贝尔格莱德举行的南斯拉夫、美国、英国、法国四国大使级代表会议的歪曲宣传。伦敦“观察家报”说：南斯拉夫正在力图利用它的地位，使得西方同俄国之间的谈判变得困难；又说南斯拉夫已向西方的大使们报告了同苏联代表团进行会谈的情况。“战斗报”指出，这种说法完全是捏造。南斯拉夫是个独立国家，过去和现在没有向任何人报告过。
      “战斗报”说，南斯拉夫、美国、英国和法国四国大使级的代表会议将讨论国际局势和相互关系问题，它只是一次自由平等地交换意见的会议。如果有任何人对即将举行的谈判作不同的想像或解释——例如像“观察家报”那样——说这次会谈应该决定南斯拉夫同西方的关系，应该说服南斯拉夫使他相信有必要改变它的政策，那他就是没有了解贝尔格莱德会议的基本目的。
