Currently, the supply and marketing cooperative system has basically concluded pre-purchase cotton work in the major cotton-producing areas across the country. This year, in addition to paying pre-sale households a pre-purchase deposit, the state has also stipulated preferential supply of grain, cotton cloth, and other unified sales materials. This has played a significant role in encouraging cotton farmers' enthusiasm for production and ensuring cotton planting is in accordance with national plans.

However, it would be completely wrong to think that there are no problems with the pre-purchase cotton work just because the pre-purchase cotton targets have been completed and pre-purchase contracts have been signed. Due to the urgency of time, the heavy tasks, and the blindly optimistic attitude of many staff members toward completing pre-purchase cotton tasks, along with carelessness and greed for quantity and speed, many deviations and problems have been created in the pre-purchase work. First, there is a widespread phenomenon of falsehoods in the signed pre-purchase contracts. For example, in some areas, pre-purchase contracts are not signed through mass self-reporting and commitment to sell, but are estimated and handled by district, township, and supply and marketing cooperative staff. The Kangcun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xinxiang, Henan, originally planned to pre-purchase 5,150 mu of cotton, but farmers in this village actually planted 4,820 mu of cotton. However, the quantity of pre-purchased cotton was even greater than the original plan. Some areas pre-purchased an amount equal to the estimated total cotton production, leaving no cotton for farmers to use themselves. Obviously, these practices are inappropriate. In some areas, due to chaotic procedures, there are also many cases of misidentification and numerical errors in filling out contracts. When an agricultural production cooperative in Dingxinzhuang, Wuqing County, Hebei, signed a pre-purchase contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, it originally reported “Nuli Cooperative,” but the cotton sales certificate issued to the cooperative by the supply and marketing cooperative mistakenly stated “Zhangyou Cooperative.” The cooperative actually planted 90 mu of cotton, but in filling out the contract, one party mistakenly wrote 900 mu, and the other party even mistakenly wrote 9,000 mu. These errors were caused by careless work and chaotic procedures. Since many areas did not seriously conduct policy propaganda when pre-purchasing cotton, the phenomenon of cotton farmers falsely reporting cotton field acreage and estimated cotton yield in order to receive more deposits and in-kind preferential supply vouchers is even more serious. A sample survey of fifteen households in Dazhou Village, Luancheng County, Hebei, found that twelve households had over-reported cotton field acreage. There is also another situation: some cotton farmers, fearing that it would be inconvenient to use cotton themselves after selling it in the autumn, reported less than they planted and concealed their yields.

Second, there are also many shortcomings and problems in the pre-payment of deposits and the distribution of in-kind supply vouchers. The state's distribution of a certain amount of deposits and in-kind supply vouchers to cotton farmers is, on the one hand, to help cotton farmers in difficulty solve production and living problems, but the more important significance is to control the cotton, urge cotton farmers to abide by contract credit, work hard in production, and resolutely realize the cotton production increase plan. However, some areas mistakenly regarded pre-purchase cotton deposits as relief funds or agricultural loans. Some areas only gave deposits to poor farmers and not to wealthy households. Due to the considerable falsehood and errors in the pre-purchase contracts, some farmers actually pre-sold cotton but did not receive pre-purchase deposits and in-kind supply vouchers, while some farmers who received deposits and in-kind supply vouchers did not grow cotton or grew very little. Some areas even deducted the pre-purchase deposit that farmers should have received to repay old debts. These erroneous practices have already caused some cotton farmers to doubt and be dissatisfied with the pre-purchase cotton policy.

All of these situations require supply and marketing cooperatives to conduct a thorough review of the pre-purchase cotton work. Some people believe that since the state is going to implement unified purchase of cotton anyway, pre-purchase of cotton is unnecessary, and reviewing pre-purchase contracts is even "unnecessary." This understanding is incorrect. This is because these people have not yet understood the relationship between pre-purchase and unified purchase, have not recognized that pre-purchase of cotton can prompt cotton farmers to sow cotton and deliver cotton in accordance with national plans, and have not recognized that the state's pre-purchase of cotton from farmers is an important method and means to ensure the complete realization of unified purchase tasks. Accurately implementing the pre-purchase contract is precisely to ensure the completion of the unified purchase of cotton tasks. At the same time, once the contract is signed, it will have legal effect when it is executed in the future, and it is binding on both parties; then, since the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors have been found in the current pre-purchase work, why not actively try to correct them as soon as possible? For example, if those false and erroneous pre-purchase contracts are not actively corrected now, how can they be implemented in the future? Failure to pay attention to the review of pre-purchase cotton contracts is likely to turn the pre-purchase cotton contract into a piece of waste paper. The cotton unified purchase task in many areas in 1954 was not completed well, which is inseparable from the hasty pre-purchase cotton work last year. It can be seen from this that a thorough review of cotton pre-purchase work and verification of pre-purchase contracts is completely necessary.

At present, Hebei, Henan, Liaoning and other provinces have started or are transitioning to the review of pre-purchase cotton contracts, which is very timely. In the review, it is necessary to repeatedly educate cotton farmers to abide by the contract, and to clarify the errors on the signed pre-purchase contract. When revising the pre-purchase contract, a specific analysis should be carried out: if it is because the supply and marketing cooperative blindly signed the contract, resulting in a large difference between the pre-purchased cotton quantity and the estimated yield of the actual cotton planting acreage, or if the cotton farmers falsely reported the acreage in order to receive more pre-purchase deposits and are very serious, they should be carefully checked, clarify the actual cotton planting acreage, modify it in the contract, and recover the over-received deposits and in-kind supply vouchers. For those households who have over-reported the cotton field acreage and the contract is not much different, the contract should also be modified, but it is not necessary to return the money and goods. In principle, the contract can no longer be changed for any slight overestimation or underestimation, so as to avoid work chaos caused by too many changes, but these cotton farmers should be educated to strive to increase cotton production to ensure the realization of the pre-purchase contract. For those who have not given enough deposits and in-kind supply vouchers to cotton farmers during pre-purchase, they should be quickly reissued; the erroneous practice of some areas forcibly deducting the deposits received by cotton farmers to repay old debts should be corrected immediately.

The review of cotton pre-purchase work by supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must be combined with the current central work; and the assistance of district and township staff should be obtained and the masses should be relied on to do this work well. Some areas use agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups as units, combined with production competitions, to carry out mass self-inspection and mutual inspection; some areas publish the number of cotton planting acres, pre-purchase quantity, and the number of deposits used on the pre-purchase contract, mobilize the masses to check themselves, and go deep into the fields to check. These methods are feasible. In addition, the supply and marketing cooperative should also pay close attention to and maintain close contact with the representatives of the party who signed the pre-purchase contract, understand the cotton growth, prepare and supply fertilizers and pesticides and agricultural machinery needed by cotton farmers in a timely manner, and help cotton farmers to eliminate pests and diseases, so as to ensure the realization of the cotton production increase plan and lay a good foundation for the realization of the pre-purchase contract and the completion of the national unified purchase of cotton plan in the autumn.

### 重视对预购棉花合同的复查

    重视对预购棉花合同的复查
    江夏
    目前供销合作社系统在全国各主要棉产区的预购棉花工作已经基本结束。今年国家在预购棉花中除支付给预售户预购定金外，还特别规定了优待供应粮食、棉布等统销物资。这对于鼓励棉农生产情绪、保证按照国家计划种植棉花起了重大的作用。
    但是，如果只看到预购棉花指标已经完成，预购合同已经签定，就以为预购棉花工作没有问题了，那是十分错误的。今年的预购棉花工作由于时间紧迫，任务繁重，再加上不少工作人员对完成预购棉花任务有盲目乐观情绪，粗枝大叶和贪多求快，这就给预购工作造成了不少偏差和问题。首先，在签定的预购合同中普遍有虚假现象。例如有的地区在签定预购合同时，不是先通过群众自报和认售，而是由区、乡和供销社的工作人员随便估计，包办造册。河南新乡亢村供销社原计划预购五千一百五十亩棉花，这村农民实种四千八百二十亩棉花，但预购棉花的数量比原计划预购的数量还多。有的地区预购棉花的数量等于预计棉花总产量，不给棉农留下自用棉。显然，这些做法都是不妥的。有些地区在填写合同时，因手续混乱，弄得张冠李戴和数字错乱的也不少。河北武清县丁辛庄一个农业生产合作社和供销社签定预购合同时原报的是“努力社”，可是供销社发给这个社的售棉证上却错为
  “张有社”；这个社实种棉花九十亩，可是在填写合同时一方错成了九百亩，另一方竟错成了九千亩。这些错误都是因工作粗枝大叶手续混乱而造成的。由于不少地区在预购棉花时不认真进行政策宣传，棉农为了多领定金和实物优待供应凭证而虚报棉田亩数和棉花预计产量的现象更为严重。河北栾城县大周村抽查了十五户，其中有十二户都多报了棉田亩数。也有另外一种情况：有的棉农怕秋后卖了棉花，自己用棉不方便，种多报少，隐瞒产量。
    其次，在预付定金和分发实物供应凭证方面也有不少缺点和问题。国家发放一定数量的定金和实物供应凭证给棉农，一方面固然是为了帮助有困难的棉农解决生产、生活上的困难，但更重要的意义是为了掌握棉花，督促棉农能够遵守合同信用，努力生产，坚决实现棉花增产计划。可是有些地区却错误地把预购棉花定金当成救济金或农业贷款。有的地区发放定金时只给贫农而不给富裕户。由于预购合同有相当的虚假性和讹误，使得某些农民实际上预售了棉花，却没领到预购定金和实物供应凭证，而某些领到定金和实物供应凭证的农民又没有种棉花或种得很少。有些地区甚至把农民应领的预购定金硬扣还了旧债。这些错误的做法已经使得一部分棉农对预购棉花政策产生了怀疑和不满。
    所有这些情况都要求供销社必须认真地把预购棉花工作进行一次彻底的复查。有人认为：国家反正是要实行棉花统购的，预购棉花本来就没有必要，复查预购合同更是“多此一举”。这种认识是不正确的。这是因为这些人还没有认识预购和统购的关系，没有认识预购棉花能够促使棉农按照国家计划播种棉花和交售棉花，没有认识国家向农民预购棉花正是为了保证统购任务完满实现的重要方法和手段。准确地实现预购合同，正是为了能够保证完成统购棉花任务。同时，合同一经签定，在将来执行时就产生法律效力，对双方都有约束力；那末，既然发现当前在预购工作中发生了上述缺点和错误，为什么不及早把它改正过来呢？例如对那些虚假的和有讹误的预购合同如果现在不积极设法改正，将来又怎么执行得通呢？不重视对预购棉花合同的复查，就很有可能使预购棉花合同变成为废纸的危险。一九五四年度很多地区的棉花统购任务都完成得不好，是和去年预购棉花工作的草率分不开的。由此可见彻底复查棉花预购工作核定预购合同是完全必要的。
    目前河北、河南、辽宁等省都已经开始或正在转入预购棉花合同的复查工作，这是十分适时的。在复查中必须反复地向棉农进行遵守合同的教育，要把已经签定的预购合同上的讹误弄清楚。在修改预购合同时要进行具体分析：如果是因供销社一方盲目签定以致预购棉花数量和实际植棉亩数的预计产量相差很大，或是因棉农为了多领预购定金虚报亩数而又十分严重，都应该认真查对，弄清确实的植棉亩数，在合同上修改过来，并把多领的定金和实物供应凭证追回。对于多报棉田亩数而和合同出入不大的户，也应在合同上修改过来，但可以不必退回款、物。凡属于估产稍有偏高或偏低，原则上可以不再改动合同，以避免因过多的变动而造成工作上的混乱，但应教育这些棉农努力提高棉花产量，以保证预购合同的实现。对于供销社在预购时没有给足棉农定金和实物供应凭证的，应该迅速补发；有些地区硬把棉农领到的定金扣还旧债的错误做法应该立即纠正。
    各地供销社复查棉花预购工作必须和当前中心工作结合进行；并应取得区、乡工作人员的协助和紧紧依靠群众来做好这件工作。有的地区采用以农业生产合作社和互助组为单位，结合生产竞赛，开展群众性的自查和互查；有的地区把预购合同上的种棉亩数、预购量、使用定金数出榜公布，发动群众自行核对，并深入田间核对。这些办法都是可行的。此外，供销社还应该经常注意和签定预购合同一方的代表人密切联系，了解棉花生长情况，及时准备和供应棉农所需肥料和农药农械，帮助棉农除治虫害，以保证棉花增产计划的实现，为秋后实现预购合同和完成国家统购棉花计划打下良好的基础。
