    The People's Eyes Are Sharp
    Fang Shishan
    The people's eyes are sharp, and nothing can be hidden from them. No matter how clever the counter-revolutionary elements' conspiracies are, the people always have ways to see through them, and they cannot escape the people's giant palms. The Hu Feng Group's anti-Party, anti-people criminal face has been exposed due to the revelations of the people nationwide and the disclosure of the three batches of materials.
    After reading the "People's Daily" published "The Third Batch of Materials Regarding the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," I further recognized that Hu Feng is a beast in human clothing, a special agent who secretly deployed his forces, harboring a murderous plot to destroy the people's revolutionary cause by hook or by crook. He is engaging in criminal activities that endanger the people and the country.
    The people's laws are strict and will surely eradicate the scourge of counter-revolution. In the future, we must better heighten our vigilance, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, unite with the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, so that any saboteurs have no gaps to enter, no opportunities to seize, and defend our socialist cause.

    人民的眼睛是雪亮的
    方石珊
    人民的眼睛是雪亮的，没有瞒得过人民的事情。反革命分子的阴谋无论如何巧妙，人民总有法子看破它，它是无法逃出人民的巨掌的。胡风集团反党反人民的罪恶面目由于全国人民的揭发，和三批材料的披露，真相大白了。
    我看了“人民日报”发表的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”，更认清了胡风是一个人面兽心的特务，他密布羽翼，怀着杀人不见血的阴谋，处心积虑地要破坏人民革命事业。他干着危害人民、危害国家的罪恶勾当。
    人民法律森严，一定能够根除反革命的祸害。今后我们要更好地提高警惕，在中国共产党领导之下，用批评和自我批评的武器团结一致，使任何破坏分子无缝可入，无隙可乘，保卫我们的社会主义事业。
