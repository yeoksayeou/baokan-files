    The Roads of Italy
    Hu Sisheng
    Recently, there have been new and important developments in the Italian political situation. The calls from patriotic democratic forces demanding to break away from the imperialist military bloc policy and pursue a peaceful and independent foreign policy have become louder, and their influence has even extended to some groups and parties that support the so-called "Atlantic policy."

    The recent Italian presidential election reflected this development in the Italian political situation. As everyone knows, in the run-up to the election, Italian Prime Minister Scelba and the right wing of the Christian Democratic Party, disregarding the opposition of many members of the Upper and Lower Houses, insisted on nominating Mezzogiorno, who had connections with Italian monopoly capital and powerful American groups, as the party's presidential candidate. However, during the voting, most members of parliament, including a large number of Christian Democratic Party members, did not approve of Mezzogiorno. They nominated Gronchi, the leader of the intra-party opposition who criticized certain foreign policies of the government, as a presidential candidate. Although the ruling pro-American forces used various methods, coupled with pressure from Washington, the result was that Gronchi, whom they opposed, was elected president.

    The results of the presidential election proved that even within the ruling Christian Democratic Party, there is growing dissatisfaction with the government and policies led by this party. Things have developed to the point where the "centralizing faction" of this party, led by Guido Gonella, former secretary-general of the party, and Giuseppe Pella, former prime minister, also opposes the current government's foreign policy direction and has raised the question of the Scelba government's resignation.

  The "centralizing faction" members condemned the current government for being "stagnant" and "lacking flexibility" in the face of new developments in the international situation. This split within the ruling party shows that the crisis in the Scelba government's domestic and foreign policies has reached a serious degree.

    Among the Italian people, a sharp question has been raised: Should Italy continue to allow itself to be tied to the American war chariot, thus becoming increasingly deeply mired in difficulties in political and economic aspects and inviting the disaster of war? Or should it resolutely break away from the shackles of the American military bloc policy, embark on the road of independent development, so as to avoid national disasters and seek security for its national status and improvement in the people's lives?

    In this situation, the signing of the Austrian State Treaty—which enabled Austria to gain independence and peaceful development while ensuring that it did not participate in military blocs and pursued an independent policy—could not but have a profound impact on Italian public opinion. The leadership of the Italian Communist Party, in a statement issued on May 26 on the international situation and the new situation created by the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty, pointed out: "The number of countries in Central Europe that wish to remain outside military blocs is increasing, which is a major contribution to easing international tensions." The statement also pointed out that the changes in the international situation require a reconsideration of Italy's foreign policy. At the same time, broad public opinion, including some newspapers and publications affiliated with the ruling party, praised Austria's approach as realistic and in line with the interests of Austria and European peace and security. The Catholic weekly "Prospettive" representing the views of Italian President Gronchi's faction, using "the achievements of Catholic Austria" as an example, pointed out that there is now a real possibility before Italy to pursue a policy of promoting the relaxation of international tensions and establishing good-neighborly relations between countries, together with neutral countries. "Prospettive" also called on Italy to get rid of "prejudice" and stand on a "realistic basis" to "further cooperate with countries in the East and West." This demand of Italian democratic forces and social public opinion reflects the Italian people's dissatisfaction with the current foreign policy and their strong desire for peace and independence.

    Since the Christian Democratic Party government, which serves the interests of monopoly capital, implemented the so-called "Atlantic policy" and joined the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, Italy's international status and domestic life have undergone adverse changes. Italy's foreign policy has succumbed to the interests of the American ruling clique. American troops are stationed on Italian territory, infringing on Italy's independence and sovereignty. The approval and implementation of the Paris Accords, which revive German militarism, seriously threaten Italy's security and risk dragging Italy into a new war. In the past six years, Italy's military expenditure has reached the huge figure of 2,747.5 billion lire, which cannot but seriously affect the domestic economic life and cause economic stagnation and decline. As the Italian government has pursued a policy of arms expansion and war preparation, disregarding the suffering of the people, the lives of the Italian working people are deteriorating. These facts make it clear to the Italian people that the Italian government's current domestic and foreign policies run counter to Italy's national interests and are leading Italy into the abyss of disaster. Therefore, the proposal of the Italian democratic forces to change Italy's current policy has become a common demand of the broad masses of the people.

    This development of the Italian situation has caused serious anxiety among the American aggressive bloc. It is doing everything possible to subdue the Italian people's demand for independence, keep Italy under its control, and turn it into its market and military base. The United States is openly interfering to suppress the calls from the Italian public, within the parliament, and from most members of the Christian Democratic Party demanding the resignation of the Scelba government, which is subservient to monopoly capital and the American "Atlantic policy." The American propaganda machine blatantly threatens that if the political crisis leads to the downfall of "a good friend of the United States like Scelba," the United States will immediately stop "aid" to Italy. Moreover, the American authorities and the Scelba government are planning to transfer 16,000 American troops, who should be withdrawn from Austria after the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty, to Italy to strengthen the military occupation of Italy. The Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera" pointed out in a commentary that this American approach is "a measure to prevent any changes in Italian policy that may be caused by the election of Gronchi as president and changes in the European situation."

    The United States's blatant interference in Italy's internal affairs and the news that the United States is planning to strengthen its military occupation of Italy have been severely condemned by Italian public opinion, and a wave of angry protests has swept across Italy. Peace committees in many cities and provinces have held emergency meetings and passed resolutions opposing the plan to strengthen the American military occupation of Italy, and have sent these resolutions to the president and the speakers of both houses of parliament. Calls have been issued throughout the country: "Our land and our ports should not become a springboard for atomic warfare planned by foreigners!"

    However, the ruling clique in Italy, with the intervention and support of Washington, is doing its utmost to resist the demands of the people and has indicated that it will continue to pursue the disastrous policy of following the United States. In a statement issued on May 24, the Scelba government stubbornly stated that the Italian government "firmly supports the policies that led to the North Atlantic Treaty, the Paris Accords, and the Western European Union." Italian Foreign Minister Martino even openly disregarded Italy's national sovereignty at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Italian Senate, declaring that the issue of transferring the American troops currently stationed in Austria to Italian bases should be decided by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council.

    Now, the democratic forces in Italy that demand that the country take the road of peaceful and independent development are engaged in a sharp struggle with the forces that betray national interests and follow the United States on the road of military blocs and war preparation. The development of the situation shows that the struggle of the Italian patriotic forces to change the current foreign policy is rapidly expanding into an irresistible huge movement. The power of the people will determine the road of Italy.

    意大利的道路
    胡思升
    最近以来，意大利的政治局势有了新的重要的发展。爱国的民主力量要求摆脱帝国主义军事集团政策而奉行和平和独立的外交政策的呼声更加响亮了，并且其影响还扩及到了拥护所谓“大西洋政策”的一些集团和政党内部。
    不久前举行的意大利总统选举，就反映了意大利政治局势的这种发展。大家知道，在选举前夕，意大利总理谢尔巴和天主教民主党右翼不顾上、下议院很多议员的反对，坚持提出同意大利垄断资本和美国有势力集团有联系的梅查戈拉为该党的总统候选人。但是在投票时，大部分议员，包括天主教民主党的很大一部分议员都不赞成梅查戈拉，他们提出批评政府的某些外交政策的党内反对派领袖格隆基为总统候选人。虽然当政的亲美势力用了种种手法，加上来自华盛顿方面的压力，但是结果还是他们所反对的格隆基当选了总统。
    总统选举的结果证明，甚至在执政的天主教民主党内部，也有着对这个党领导的政府和政策的日益增长的不满。事情已经发展到这样的程度，这个党的以该党前总书记基多·戈内拉、前总理朱塞佩·贝拉等为首的“集权派”也反对现政府的外交政策方针，而且提出要谢尔巴政府辞职的问题。
  “集权派”分子谴责现政府在国际形势新的发展面前“停滞不前”和“缺乏灵活性”。执政党内部发生的这种分裂说明了谢尔巴政府内外政策的危机已经到了严重的程度。
    在意大利人民中间，尖锐地提出了这样的问题：意大利是继续让自己被绑缚在美国的战车上因而在政治经济各方面愈来愈深地陷入困境并招致战争的灾祸呢？还是坚决摆脱美国的军事集团政策的束缚，走上独立发展的道路，以避免民族的灾难并求得国家地位的安全和人民生活的改善。
    在这种形势下，奥地利国家条约的签订——它使奥地利在保证不参加军事集团和执行独立的政策的情形下获得了独立和和平发展的地位——，不能不对意大利的舆论产生深刻的影响。意大利共产党领导机构在五月二十六日就国际局势和由于缔结奥地利国家条约而形成的新局面而发表的声明中指出：“欧洲中部希望保持在军事集团之外的国家正在增多，这对缓和国际紧张局势是一个重大贡献。”这个声明并指出，国际局势的改变要求重新考虑意大利的外交政策。与此同时，广泛的舆论，包括一些与执政党有联系的报纸刊物，都赞扬奥地利的做法是现实的，是符合奥地利以及欧洲和平和安全的利益的。代表意大利总统格隆基派的意见的天主教的“前景”周刊就以“天主教奥地利的成就”为实例指出：目前在意大利面前存在着实际的可能来同中立国家一道奉行促进国际紧张局势的缓和和建立各国之间的善邻关系的政策。“前景”周刊并呼吁意大利摆脱“偏见”，站在“现实的基础上”“和东西方各国进一步合作”。意大利民主力量和社会舆论的这种要求，反映了意大利人民对现行外交政策的不满和对于和平和独立的强烈愿望。
    自从意大利为垄断资本利益服务的天主教民主党政府执行所谓“大西洋政策”、加入北大西洋侵略集团以来，意大利的国际地位和国内生活发生了恶劣的变化。意大利的外交政策屈从于美国统治集团的利益。美国军队驻扎在意大利的领土上，使意大利的独立和主权受到侵害。复活德国军国主义的巴黎协定的批准和实施，严重地威胁着意大利的安全，有把意大利拖入新战争的危险。六年来，意大利的军费开支达到两万七千四百七十五亿里拉的庞大数字，这样就不能不严重地影响到国内的经济生活，并使经济日见停滞和衰退。由于意大利政府执行了扩军备战的政策，不顾人民的疾苦，意大利劳动人民的生活每况愈下。这些事实，使意大利人民清楚地看到，意大利政府现行的内外政策和意大利的民族利益背道而驰，正在把意大利导向灾难的深渊。因此，意大利民主力量提出的改变意大利现行政策的主张已经成为广大人民共同的要求。
    意大利局势的这种发展，引起了美国侵略集团的严重不安。它正竭尽一切方法，力图压服意大利人民独立的要求，把意大利继续放在它的控制之下，成为它的市场和军事基地。美国公开进行干涉来压制意大利广大公众、议会内部以及天主教民主党的大部分议员要求屈从垄断资本和美国“大西洋政策”的谢尔巴政府辞职的呼声。美国宣传机器露骨地威胁着：如果政治危机促成“像谢尔巴这样的美国的好朋友”垮台的话，美国将立刻停止对意大利的“援助”。不仅如此，美国当局还和谢尔巴政府策划着要把美国在奥地利国家条约缔结后应当从奥地利撤出的一万六千名军队调到意大利，以加强对意大利的军事占领。意大利“邮报”在评论中指出，美国的这种做法是为了“防止由于格隆基当选为总统和欧洲局势变化可能引起的意大利政策的任何变化的措施”。
    美国对意大利内政的粗暴干涉和美国策划加强对意大利的军事占领的消息，遭到了意大利舆论的严厉谴责，意大利人民掀起了愤怒的抗议浪潮。许多城市和省的和平委员会召开了紧急会议，通过决议反对美军加强占领意大利的计划，并且把这些决议送给总统和议会两院的议长。全国各地都发出呼声：“我们的土地和我们的港口不应当成为外国人所策划的原子战争的跳板！”
    但是，意大利的当权集团在华盛顿的干涉和支持之下，竭力抵制着人民的要求，并表示要继续奉行追随美国的灾难政策。谢尔巴政府在五月二十四日发表的声明中就顽固地表示，意大利政府“坚定地支持导致北大西洋公约、巴黎协定和西欧联盟的政策”。谢尔巴政府的外交部长马蒂诺甚至在意大利参议院外交委员会上公然不顾意大利的国家主权，宣布：将目前驻在奥地利的美国军队调到意大利基地来的这件事，应当由北大西洋公约组织理事会来决定。
    现在，意大利民主的和要求国家走和平和独立发展道路的力量，正同出卖民族利益、追随美国走军事集团和准备战争道路的力量展开尖锐的斗争。局势的发展显示，意大利爱国力量为改变现行外交政策而进行的斗争，正在迅速扩大成为势不可挡的巨大运动。人民的力量将决定意大利的道路。
