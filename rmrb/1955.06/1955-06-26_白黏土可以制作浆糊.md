    White Clay Can Be Used to Make Paste

    To the Editor:

    Recently, in the Yushan area of the fourth district of Licheng County near Jinan City, we discovered a type of white clay (locally called "Ganzi soil," "Zao Wang soil," solid, white in color, and with adhesiveness) that can replace flour in making paste, saving a significant amount of grain.

    The method for making paste with this white clay is very simple. First, grind the white clay finely, then sift it through a sieve with 130 meshes per 2.54 centimeters. After that, mix one-third flour with two-thirds white clay, and mix evenly with cold water (note that water must be added and mixed before boiling). Then, place the pot on the stove to cook. While cooking, stir frequently with a wooden stick inside the pot to prevent settling, until cooked through. Let it cool completely before using.

    If this paste is used to make "Ge Bei" (stiff interlining, called "Ying Chen" in some places), in terms of usage, one-quarter flour can be mixed with three-quarters white clay. Add caustic soda at a ratio of 2 liang per jin of flour, dissolve the caustic soda in a basin with boiling water, and mix it in. It should not be used on the same day it is made, but can be used the next day.

    In the past, a match factory needed 125 grams of flour to paste 1,000 matchboxes. If white clay is used, only 56.25 grams of flour are needed. Jinan City has eight match factories, which use 17,677 jin of flour per month for pasting boxes. If white clay is used as a substitute, more than 9,700 jin of flour can be saved each month. In the past, one jin of flour was needed to make five "Ge Bei." Now, using one jin of flour mixed with three jin of white clay to make paste can produce 13.5 "Ge Bei." Jinan City has four "Ge Bei" groups/cooperatives, which use 28,188 jin of flour per month. According to the test results, using substitutes can save 17,748 jin of flour each month.

    The four "Ge Bei" groups/cooperatives and eight match factories in the city need 45,865 jin of flour per month. Calculated according to the ratio of substituting white clay for flour in the experiments, more than 329,500 jin of flour can be saved annually, equivalent to more than 400,000 jin of wheat.

    On May 19th, the Jinan City Grain Bureau convened a meeting of the responsible persons of eight match factories, four "Ge Bei" groups/cooperatives, and seven shoe and hat groups/cooperatives to promote the experience of using white clay to make paste. In the past, in order to solve the raw material supply of white clay, Jinan City has organized processing households to specialize in processing.

### 白黏土可以制作浆糊

    白黏土可以制作浆糊编辑同志：
    最近我们在济南市附近历城县四区禹山一带，发现一种白黏土（俗名叫干子土、皂王土固体、色白，有黏性），可以代替面粉制浆糊，节省大量的粮食。
    这种白黏土制作浆糊的办法很简单，先把白黏土研细，再用一个二点五四公分一百三十眼的罗筛筛过，以后，用三分之一的面粉、三分之二的白黏土拌匀，用凉水调匀（注意必须在煮以前添水调匀），再把锅放在炉子上烧煮，在烧煮时要用木棍在锅内勤搅不得停止，不让沉淀，直到煮熟为止，凉透后就可以用。
    如果用这种浆糊去制葛褙（有的地方叫硬衬），在用量方面，可以用四分之一的面粉拌和四分之三的白黏土，每斤面粉用火碱二两的比率，将火碱放于盆内用开水化开掺入，作好后当日不可使用，可在第二天使用。
    过去火柴厂糊火柴盒一千个需用面粉一百二十五公分，如采用白黏土只需用面粉五六点二五公分。济南市有八个火柴厂，每月糊盒用面粉一万七千六百七十七斤，如果利用白黏土来代替，每月可节省面粉九千七百多斤。过去每制五张葛褙，需用面粉一斤，现在用面粉一斤掺上三斤白黏土打成浆糊，可制一三点五张葛褙；济南市有四户葛褙组、社，每月用面粉二万八千一百八十八斤，按照试验结果，采用代用品，每月即可节约面粉一万七千七百四十八斤。
    全市四个葛褙组、社，八个火柴厂每月需要面粉四万五千八百六十五斤，按照试验用白黏土代替面粉掺配的比数计算，每年就可节约面粉三十二万九千五百多斤。折合小麦四十余万斤。
    济南市粮食局于五月十九日召开了八个火柴厂，四个葛褙组、社，并吸收了七户鞋帽组、社负责人的会议，推广了利用白黏土制作浆糊的经验。过去，为了解决白黏土的原料供应，济南市已组织了加工户专门加工。
