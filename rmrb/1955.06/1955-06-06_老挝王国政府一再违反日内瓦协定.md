    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: The "Liberation News," organ of the Lao Free National United Front, has accused the Royal Lao Government of recently establishing a so-called Sang Neua Provincial Government Office in Muong Phun and sending the Royal Government's provincial governor there. "Liberation News" pointed out that this action by the Royal Government violates the Geneva Accords because Muong Phun is within the Lao fighting forces' regrouping area.
    The newspaper said that the Royal Government undoubtedly knows that these actions are illegal, but under the instigation of the United States, it is intensifying its plot to occupy the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, which are Lao fighting forces' regrouping areas.
    "Liberation News" pointed out that the Royal Government is clearly intending to use Muong Phun as an activity center for political and military attacks against Laos. From April 29 to May 11, the Royal Government has airdropped 44 parachutes of weapons into Muong Phun and smuggled in more Royal troops. More Royal reinforcements have been sent to Phongsaly Province's Pang Nou.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: An armed force under the command of the Royal Lao Government attacked the Lao fighting forces stationed in Hoi Hong village, Muong Sang township, Sam Neua county, Sam Neua province, on May 22. On May 23, this armed force attacked the Lao fighting forces stationed in Ban Thon village, Pa Kha township, Sam Neua county.
    The Lao fighting forces did not retaliate but only tried to defend themselves to avoid conflicts and causing losses to the residents.
    The Lao fighting forces headquarters in Sam Neua has filed a complaint with the International Commission inspection team in Sam Neua. It requested the International Commission to intervene and demanded that the Royal side cease these activities, withdraw the armed forces from the aforementioned areas, and compensate the people for their losses. The Lao fighting forces headquarters also requested the International Commission to conduct an on-site investigation of the incident.

    老挝王国政府一再违反日内瓦协定
    据新华社河内电　寮国自由民族统一战线机关报“解放报”指责老挝王国政府最近在芒奔设立所谓桑怒省政府办事处，并把王国政府的省长派到那里去。“解放报”指出，王国政府的这个行动是违反日内瓦协定的，因为芒奔是在寮国战斗部队的集结区内。
    报纸说，王国政府方面无疑是知道这些行为是非法的，但是它却在美国的唆使下加紧推行占领寮国战斗部队集结区的桑怒和丰沙里两省的阴谋。
    “解放报”指出，王国政府显然是打算利用芒奔作为一个在政治上和军事上对寮国进行攻击的活动中心。从四月二十九日到五月十一日，王国政府已在芒奔空投了四十四个降落伞的武器，并偷运入更多的王国部队。更多的王国增援部队已被派到丰沙里省的磅怒。
    据新华社河内电　老挝王国政府指挥下的一支武装部队在五月二十二日进攻驻在桑怒省桑怒县孟桑乡会洪村的寮国战斗部队。五月二十三日，这支武装部队又进攻驻在桑怒县巴卡乡本通村的寮国战斗部队。
    寮国战斗部队没有回击，只是设法保卫自己，以避免发生冲突，给居民造成损失。
    桑怒的寮国战斗部队司令部已经向桑怒的国际委员会视察小组提出控诉。它要求国际委员会进行干涉，并且要求王国方面停止这种活动，把武装部队撤出上述地区，赔偿人民的损失。寮国战斗部队司令部还要求国际委员会对这一事件进行现场调查。
