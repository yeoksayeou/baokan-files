We Must Fight Against the Behavior of Overestimating Engineering Costs
Jiang Ping, President of Hebei Branch, People's Construction Bank of China

The design budget is an indicator for controlling all expenditures of construction projects. If the budget is too high, laying too big of a foundation, it will encourage waste in the construction process, increase engineering costs, and waste state funds.

In Hebei Province's basic construction, the phenomenon of overestimating engineering costs is relatively serious. According to incomplete statistics from 1954, construction units across the province wasted a total of 990,000 yuan in one year; in addition to materials worth 13.83 million yuan that have been processed, there are still materials worth 12.94 million yuan that have not been processed. However, even under such circumstances, many construction units still obtained very high profits. For example, the No. 1 Engineering Company of the Hebei Textile Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry, which contracted the state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory project, although it wasted 190,000 yuan in 1954, still obtained a super-planned profit of 2.65 million yuan. The super-planned profits obtained by the Qinhuangdao City Construction Engineering Bureau accounted for 14 percent of the contracted workload. According to our analysis of the final accounts of 15 construction enterprises in 1954, super-planned profits accounted for an average of 8 percent of the annual contracted workload. These super-planned profits, apart from a portion obtained by improving labor efficiency and saving raw materials, were mostly obtained by overestimating engineering costs. For example, out of the 260,000 yuan in super-planned profits of the Handan City Engineering Bureau, 200,000 yuan came from overestimating costs.

This phenomenon of overestimating costs has not been eliminated this year. The Hebei Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China reviewed the design budgets of 42 construction units this year and found that the overestimation of the budget accounted for 7.92 percent of the original total budget. Among them, the overestimation of temporary works in the project of the Hebei Provincial People's Committee moving to Shijiazhuang reached 28.57 percent of the original budget, and the overestimation of the budget for some projects of the Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant was 1.35 million yuan, accounting for 17.54 percent of the original budget for these projects. The design budget for the main plant foundation project of the Fengfeng New Coal Mine Engineering Office was also overestimated by 16.9 percent.

These are all very serious situations. If the design budget of each project is overestimated by a dozen percent, or even twenty percent, the state will have to pay a large amount of additional funds, and many projects that could have been built with the available funds will have to be postponed or not built at all; if every construction enterprise can obtain funds from the design budget that exceed actual needs by a dozen percent, or even twenty percent, and can massively "reduce costs" without any effort, who will bother to practice thrift and oppose waste? How can the management level of construction enterprises be improved?

However, despite the fact that overestimating costs is such a major erroneous behavior that affects the speed of national construction and the progress of enterprises, there are still many staff members in basic construction departments, including some leading staff members, who find various excuses to cover up their mistakes and even insist on their mistakes. Some staff members of the Handan City Engineering Bureau said: "The quota is too advanced, and we don't have the conditions to implement it." The Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant emphasized that the project was "special" and could not implement the national quota. Many other units emphasized "low management level," "lack of experience," "incomplete quota," and "difficult calculation."

It should be admitted that many units lack basic construction experience, design budgets are indeed incomplete, and some items may not be determined very appropriately. The sources of basic construction materials are also very wide, and prices are not uniform. These do create many difficulties for the correct preparation of design budgets. However, no one can therefore conclude that the only option is to overestimate costs, because the state has, after all, promulgated quota standards, and the main materials in basic construction are allocated by the state, with verifiable prices. Therefore, the preparation of design budgets is basically based on something, how could it be too far off? Taking the Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant as an example, the state stipulates that 42 kilograms of steel bars can be used for each cubic meter of concrete engineering, but the budget lists 276 kilograms. Even if the Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant really has insurmountable special difficulties, it should not be five times higher than the national quota. Another example is that the current quota for the loss rate of coarse sand at the Fengfeng New Coal Mine Engineering Office is 7 percent. According to workers, the actual rate is at most 4 percent, but the design budget lists it as 35 percent. Is there any "objective reason" or "special difficulty" for this?

Why is the phenomenon of overestimating costs so common and so serious? The main reason is that many units regard overestimating costs as a "trick" to complete the task of saving. Instead of starting from mobilizing the masses, improving work, and tapping potential to reduce engineering costs, they want to lay an ambush in the design budget. Some staff members of the Huolu County Warehouse said after the behavior of overestimating costs was discovered: "If you deduct so tightly, how can we complete the saving task? We have to leave some room for 'saving'!" The construction unit of the Xiahuayuan Mining Bureau also said: "What if we can't complete the saving task if we deduct too tightly?" Some units even want to use the method of overestimating costs to achieve the purpose of "spending conveniently" and "having a bit of style." The Tongxian Special District Water Conservancy Bureau deliberately inflated the budget for the Liangshui River project, with the aim of "getting a piece of the action and enriching the inside."

In order not to allow this capitalist ideology and departmentalism to damage the country's construction undertakings and to correct the phenomenon of overestimating costs, the party and government organizations at all levels in Hebei Province have strengthened their leadership over the work of reviewing design budgets. The Provincial People's Committee has successively issued two instructions to review design budgets and oppose waste. Some places have established budget review offices, and some places have also specifically convened meetings of construction units and construction enterprises to deploy the work of reviewing design budgets. Many construction units and construction departments have drawn some responsible staff and technical personnel to participate in the review of design budgets, which has promoted the development of the review work.

However, the work of reviewing design budgets is not a simple technical task. The process of reviewing design budgets is actually a process of struggle between the overall idea and the partial idea, the idea of accumulating national construction funds and the idea of extravagance and waste, the socialist economic accounting idea and the capitalist idea, and the supply system idea. In the review of design budgets, many ideological conflicts were encountered. The responsible staff of the Hebei Provincial Textile Industry Administration Bureau said: "The review of the budget is not very effective, even if it is overestimated, it will be handed over after completion." The Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant and the North China Pharmaceutical Factory emphasized that the budget was compiled by the competent department, lacked basis, and could not be reviewed; some said: "This year's budget is much better than last year's, there is nothing to review." Some said: "Our parties A and B have already argued red-faced and ear-red when compiling the budget, what can we review again?" After the director of the Tongxian Liangshui River Engineering Office was discovered to have overestimated costs, he did not agree to the reduction, but said: "We will make careful calculations, and we will hand over the surplus after completion." The Handan City Engineering Bureau believed that reviewing the budget was against them, believing that "if you don't want people to participate, you don't agree after the review," and later became angry and ordered its subordinate units not to submit any planning documents to the bank without the approval of the higher authorities.

These units' resistance and confrontational attitude towards the review of design budgets show that their budgets cannot withstand review, and also show that reviewing design budgets is unfavorable to them but beneficial to the country. In order to save national investment and control engineering costs from the budget, and to resolutely fight against all phenomena of overestimating costs, the Hebei Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China has decided to take out enough strong forces, fix a dedicated organization, grasp the key points, and complete the task of reviewing design budgets, which is the most central and prominent task of the Construction Bank, within a time limit. In the spirit of seeking truth from facts and fully consulting, all the parts where overestimation of costs is found must be eliminated, so as to achieve the purpose of saving national construction funds.

Reviewing design budgets is not only the task of the People's Construction Bank, but all construction units, construction enterprises, and competent departments have the responsibility. Therefore, it is necessary to closely combine them and jointly review design budgets, and closely rely on the leadership of the local party and government organizations.

    必须对高估工程造价的行为进行斗争
    中国人民建设银行河北省分行行长　姜萍
    设计预算是控制建设工程全部支出的指标。如果预算偏高，底子铺大了，就会助长施工过程中的浪费，加大工程成本，浪费国家资金。
    河北省基本建设中高估工程造价的现象是比较严重的。据一九五四年不完全的统计，全省施工单位一年中浪费共达九十九万元；积压的器材，除已处理了价值一千三百八十三万元的以外，仍有价值一千二百九十四万元的未处理。但就在这种情况下，很多施工单位仍然获得了很高的利润。例如：纺织工业部河北纺织工业管理局第一工程公司承包的国营石家庄第二棉纺织厂工程，一九五四年虽然浪费了十九万元，但仍然获得了二百六十五万元的超计划利润。秦皇岛市建筑工程局获得的超计划利润占承包工作量的百分之十四。根据我们一九五四年对十五个建筑企业工程决算的分析，超计划利润平均占全年承包工作量的百分之八。这些超计划利润，除部分是由于提高劳动效率和节约原材料获得的以外，绝大部分是由于高估工程造价获得的。如邯郸市工程局超计划利润二十六万元中，就有二十万元是由于高估造价得来的。
    这种高估造价的现象，在今年也还没有消除。中国人民建设银行河北省分行今年审查了四十二个建设单位的设计预算，发现高估预算竟占原预算总值的百分之七点九二。其中河北省人民委员会迁到石家庄的工程的临时工程高估造价的数目，达原预算的百分之二十八点五七，石家庄热电厂部分工程的预算中，高估造价一百三十五万元，占这部分工程原预算的百分之十七点五四。峰峰新机工程处主厂房基础工程的设计预算，也高估了百分之十六点九。
    这些都是很严重的情况。如果每一项工程的设计预算，都像这样高估百分之十几，乃至百分之二十几，国家就要多付出很大一笔资金，许多原来有钱可以建设的工程只能缓建或不建；如果每一个建筑企业，都可以从设计预算中得到比实际需要超出百分之十几，乃至百分之二十几的资金，都可以不经任何努力就大量“降低成本”，还会有谁去厉行节约、反对浪费呢？建筑企业的经营管理水平怎么能提高呢？
    但是，尽管高估造价是这样一个影响国家建设速度、影响企业工作前进的重大的错误行为，却还有许多基本建设部门的工作人员，包括一些领导工作人员，找寻种种借口来掩饰自己的错误，甚至坚持自己的错误。邯郸市工程局有些工作人员说：“定额太先进了，我们这里没有条件执行”。石家庄热电厂强调工程“特殊”，不能执行国家的定额。还有许多单位都是强调“管理水平低”、“经验不足”、“定额不全”、“计算困难”。
    应该承认，许多单位是缺乏基本建设经验的，设计预算也确实不完全，也可能有一些项目定得不十分妥贴，基本建设的器材来源很广，价格也不统一。这些确实都给正确的编制设计预算造成很多困难。但是，任何人也不能因而得出唯有高估造价的结论，因为国家毕竟颁布了定额标准，基本建设中的主要材料都是由国家调拨的物资，有价可查。因此，编制设计预算基本上是有所遵循的，怎么可能相去太远呢？拿石家庄热电厂来说，国家规定每立方公尺混凝土工程可用四十二公斤钢筋，预算上却列为二百七十六公斤，石家庄热电厂即使真有了不得的特殊困难，也不至于必须较国家定额高五倍。又如峰峰新机工程处现行的粗砂损耗率定额规定为百分之七，据工人反映实际上最多也不过百分之四，而设计预算竟列为百分之三十五。这难道也有什么“客观原因”和“特殊困难”吗？
    为什么高估造价的现象这样普遍，这样严重呢？最主要的原因是：许多单位把高估造价当作完成节约任务的“窍门”。他们不从发动群众、改进工作、挖掘潜力着手，来降低工程成本，却想在设计预算上打下埋伏。获鹿县仓库有些工作人员在高估造价的行为被发现后就说：“扣这么紧，怎么完成节约任务？总得给留点‘节约’余地呀！”下花园矿务局的建筑单位也说：“扣得太紧了，完不成节约任务怎么办？”甚至有些单位想利用高估造价的办法达到“花着方便”、“有点气派”的目的，通县专区水利局在编制凉水河工程预算时有意造大，目的就是想“捞一把，充实内部”。
    为了不让这种资本主义思想和本位主义思想来损害国家的建设事业，纠正高估造价的现象，河北省各级党和政府的组织加强了对审查设计预算工作的领导，省人民委员会曾先后发出了两次审查设计预算、反对浪费的指示，有的地方成立了审查预算办公室，有的地方还专门召集了建设单位、建筑企业会议，布置审查设计预算的工作。许多建设单位和施工部门抽调出一些负责工作人员和技术人员参加设计预算的审查工作，推动了审查工作的开展。
    但是，设计预算的审查工作并不是一件简单的技术工作。审查设计预算的过程，实际上就是整体思想同局部思想，积累国家建设资金的思想同铺张浪费的思想，社会主义经济核算思想同资本主义思想、供给制思想的斗争过程。在审查设计预算中曾遇到许多思想抵触。河北省纺织工业管理局的负责工作人员说：“审查预算作用不大，即使高估点，完工后也是上缴。”石家庄热电厂、华北制药厂强调预算是主管部门编的，缺乏依据，没法审查；有的说：“今年预算比去年强多了，没什么可审的。”有的说：“我们甲乙双方编制预算时早就争得面红耳赤，再审还能审出啥来？”通县凉水河工程处主任在高估造价被发现后，不同意核减，却说：“我们精打细算，完工了结余再交”。邯郸市工程局认为审查预算是同他们作对，认为“要人不参加，审完不同意”，后来竟恼羞成怒，竟下令通知所属单位不经上级批准，不能给银行提送任何计划文件。
    这些单位对审查设计预算的抵触情绪和对抗态度，正说明他们的预算经不起审查，也正说明审查设计预算对他们不利，对国家有利。为了节约国家投资，从预算上来控制工程费用，坚决和一切高估造价的现象作斗争，中国人民建设银行河北省分行决定拿出足够的坚强的力量，固定专门组织，抓住重点，限期完成审查设计预算这个建设银行最中心最突出的任务，对发现的高估造价部分，一定本着实事求是，充分协商的精神全部剔出，达到节省国家建设资金的目的。
    审查设计预算，不仅是人民建设银行的任务，各个建设单位、建筑企业和主管部门都有责任，因此，必须密切结合起来，共同来审查设计预算，并紧紧地依靠当地党和政府组织的领导。
