    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th. More than 5,000 demobilized construction soldiers in 43 counties including Taigu County and Yangquan City in Shanxi Province have been properly resettled. Some have joined factories, enterprises and government agencies, while others have returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. Governments at all levels have allocated more than 4,000 mu of land to more than 800 demobilized construction soldiers who are landless, homeless, or lack land and housing, and have issued more than 30,000 yuan in subsidies to help them purchase means of production.
    Demobilized construction soldiers in various places are actively participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. 80 percent of the demobilized construction soldiers participating in agricultural production in eight counties including Wutai and Yicheng have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Demobilized construction soldiers have performed well in production and work, and many have become backbones in rural areas. Of the 152 cadres who were partially separated from production in Qi County, 74 are demobilized construction soldiers. In Tunliu County, more than 100 demobilized construction soldiers have served as secretaries of the Chinese Communist Party branches, township chiefs, members of township people's governments, and directors of agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives. Some have become production models. In more than 30 counties including Linfen in southern Shanxi alone, there are more than 470 model demobilized construction soldiers.

    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 5th. Demobilized construction soldiers have become an important force in the construction of the Yumen Oilfield. A large number of labor models and advanced workers have emerged from the demobilized construction soldiers working in the geology, drilling, oil extraction, refining, and transportation departments of the Yumen Oilfield. Demobilized construction soldiers working in the drilling department, through hard study and practice, quickly learned advanced Soviet experience in drilling deep wells, drilling wells in winter, and rapid drilling. The drilling team led by demobilized construction soldier Wu Niantai overfulfilled the drilling task for seven consecutive months in 1954, and comprehensively completed various indicators of the national drilling requirements, turning a drilling team that was originally backward in all aspects into an advanced drilling team. In the transportation department, more than 800 demobilized construction soldiers drive cars and run on the crude oil east transport line every day. Most of them are skilled in driving, and the Third Transportation Brigade has produced more than 40 excellent drivers who have driven safely for more than 50,000 kilometers.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 5th. The 20 demobilized construction soldiers in the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, have all participated in the work of the farm. Some of these demobilized construction soldiers were originally from the village, and some were outsiders who voluntarily requested to work at the farm when they were demobilized.
    The Communist Party branch and the farm management committee cadres in the farm are very concerned about the demobilized construction soldiers. The demobilized construction soldiers have all had suitable jobs. In the work and collective activities of the farm, they have maintained and carried forward the fine traditions of the People's Army. Han Changfan was a cadre in charge of veterinary work in the army. After he was demobilized to the Xinghuo Collective Farm in 1952, the farm assigned him to lead the raising of livestock based on his skills. He is conscientious and responsible for his work, strives to complete the tasks assigned to him by the farm, and has won praise from the villagers, and was elected as a member of the farm management committee. In the general election, he was also elected as the deputy village chief. Demobilized construction soldier Nan Changfan was responsible for the public pig raising work of the farm in 1953 and 1954. Regardless of the severe cold or scorching heat, he took care of the pigs he raised. Whenever sows gave birth to piglets, he stayed in the pigsty at night, patiently protecting the piglets to prevent them from being crushed to death by the big pigs. He and two other demobilized construction soldiers were rated as models by the villagers for their excellent work performance.
    Demobilized construction soldiers live very happily in the farm. Their labor income is quite high. Nan Changfan did more than 280 workdays in 1954, and was one of the villagers with the highest income. Revolutionary disabled soldier Fang Mingchun, although he could not often participate in labor due to poor health, also earned more than 500 yuan in 1954. Two demobilized construction soldiers from other places got married and started families in the spring of 1955. When they got married, the farm also allocated funds from the public welfare fund to subsidize them.

    山西省许多复员建设军人参加工作和生产
    玉门油矿的复员建设军人中涌现大批劳动模范
    新华社太原五日电　山西省太谷等四十三个县和阳泉市的五千多个复员建设军人都得到了妥善的安置。其中有的参加了工厂企业和机关的工作，有的回乡参加了农业生产。各级政府共分配了四千多亩土地给八百多个无房无地和缺地少屋的复员建设军人，并发给三万多元补助金帮助他们购买生产资料。
    各地复员建设军人都积极参加互助合作组织。五台、翼城等八个县参加农业生产的复员建设军人中有百分之八十的人参加了互助合作组织。复员建设军人在生产和工作中表现都很好，有不少人已成为农村中的骨干。祁县一百五十二个半脱离生产的干部就有七十四个是复员建设军人。屯留县有一百多个复员建设军人分别担任了中国共产党支部书记、乡长、乡人民政府委员和农业生产合作社社长、供销社主任等职务。有的已成为生产模范。仅晋南临汾等三十多个县就有四百七十多个模范复员建设军人。
    新华社兰州五日电　复员建设军人已成为玉门油矿建设中的一支重要力量。在玉门油矿的地质、钻井、采油、炼油、运输等部门工作的复员建设军人中，涌现出大批的劳动模范和先进工作者。在钻井处工作的复员建设军人，经过苦学苦练，很快学会了钻深井、冬季打井、快速钻井等苏联先进经验。复员建设军人吴年泰领导的钻井队，一九五四年连续七个月超额完成钻井任务，并全面完成了国家对钻井要求的各项指标，使一个原来各方面都很落后的钻井队变成了先进钻井队。在运输处，有八百多名复员建设军人驾驶着汽车，每天奔驰在原油东运线上。他们之中大部分人的驾驶技术都很熟练，第三运输大队并出现了四十多个安全行驶五万多公里的优秀司机。
    新华社哈尔滨五日电　黑龙江省桦川县星火集体农庄里的二十名复员建设军人，都参加了农庄的工作。这些复员建设军人中有原先就是本庄的人，有的是在复员时自愿要求到这个农庄来工作的外地人。
    农庄里的共产党支部和农庄管理委员会的干部对复员建设军人是很关怀的。复员建设军人都有了合适的工作。他们在农庄的工作和集体活动中，保持和发扬了人民军队的优良传统。韩昌范在军队里是负责兽医工作的干部，一九五二年复员到星火集体农庄后，农庄根据他的技能分配他领导饲养牲畜。他对工作认真负责，努力完成农庄交给的任务，得到了庄员们的赞扬，并被选为农庄管理委员会的委员。在普选中，他又被选为副村长。复员建设军人南昌范在一九五三年和一九五四年中曾负责农庄的公共养猪工作，不管严寒或酷热，他对所饲养的猪都尽心照顾，每当母猪生小猪时，他在黑夜都不离猪圈，耐心地保护小猪，以免被大猪压死。他和另外两名复员建设军人，由于工作成绩优良，被庄员们评选为模范。
    复员建设军人在农庄生活得很幸福。他们的劳动收入都不少，南昌范一九五四年做了二百八十多个劳动日，是收入最多的庄员之一。革命残废军人方明春虽然因身体不好不能经常参加劳动，但在一九五四年也收入五百多元。有两名外地来的复员建设军人，在一九五五年春季都结婚成家。他们结婚时，农庄还从公益金中拨款给以补助。
