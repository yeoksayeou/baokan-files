    Learning from Outstanding Indian Art
    Zhang Geng, Vice President of the Chinese Opera Research Institute
    After watching the song and dance performances of the Indian Cultural Delegation, I was amazed by the depth of their artistic achievement and the rigor of their training. Indian music and dance gave us a fresh and strong feeling. There appeared so much that we had never seen before, new artistic expressions unknown to us. Such as the delicate and complex rhythm of the ankle bells in Kathak dance, the varied dance postures in Bharatanatyam that we had never imagined, the expressive body movements in Kathakali dance, the complex and pleasing rhythms of the tabla (drum),... In short, each style of dance, each type of music, possesses such a high degree and such subtle methods of expression. This cannot be formed in a short period of time; it is undoubtedly the result of a long cultural tradition. Appreciating the art of our close friends makes me deeply feel that we should learn from them, learn these beautiful creations in human culture, enrich our art, and enhance the deep friendship between our hearts.
    At the same time, I also feel that Indian music and dance art is not completely unfamiliar to us. In many of their performances, we see similarities to our own art. The dramatic expressiveness of Kathakali dance is so similar to that of our classical Chinese opera art: they have their own basic dance vocabulary, create different movement systems to express different characters, and these movement systems are so detailed, accurate, and full of typicality. As long as these movements are mastered and applied, vivid character images will immediately appear before us. Similarly, based on their basic dance vocabulary, rich and subtle inner emotions can be expressed. From this, we can see the high dramatic expressiveness of this dance. In addition, there are musical instruments, especially the accompaniment methods of percussion instruments, their important role in emphasizing the rhythm of movements and emphasizing the atmosphere of emotions and its changes, which is also extremely similar to our classical opera. The use of masks (we use facial makeup), the bright and rich ornamentation of costumes, these are also similar in principle.
    In the history of Chinese song, dance, and opera, there are records of absorbing many nutrients from our neighboring India during the long period from the Northern and Southern Dynasties to the Five Dynasties, and through our assimilation and creation, these were added to our inherent art, completely integrated, and formed our unique classical opera. However, even today, these two types of art, Chinese and Indian, which are full of distinct national characteristics, can still recognize the mutual influence between them. This mutual influence undoubtedly serves as an eternally brilliant witness to our past deep friendship.
    Now our two close neighbors have stood tall again in the new world, and our arts are re-emitting, and will even more strongly emit, their light; the artists of our two countries are gathering together again. I feel that nothing can prevent our strong desire: to learn their art, to learn their art with a long tradition, based on strict training and high skills, and therefore possessing rich expressiveness and appeal. I feel that the art of our new China should absorb the best nutrients in the world to enrich it, and Indian art is an important part of it.
    I know too little about Indian art. I regret that due to my ignorance of the Indian language, I cannot fully appreciate the subtleties of their art, but I hope that we can understand it more and learn from it.
    The visit and performances of the Indian Cultural Delegation have left an indelible impression in the hearts of the Chinese people. This cultural exchange between the two major Asian nations, developed on the basis of mutual respect, mutual support, and mutual learning, will further promote our friendship, which has existed since ancient times, and this friendship and cooperation is an important factor in Asian and world peace.

    向杰出的印度艺术学习
    中国戏曲研究院副院长　张庚
    看了印度文化代表团的歌舞演出，我惊异于他们艺术造诣的高深和训练的严格。印度的音乐舞蹈，给了我们以一种清新而强烈的感觉，这里出现了多少我们从来没有见过的、为我们所不知道的艺术上的新颖表现。如像卡塔克舞的那种细致复杂的脚铃的节奏，如像婆罗多舞的那种富于变化的为我们所没有设想过的舞姿，如像卡塔卡利舞那种富于表现力的身体动作，如像塔布拉（鼓）的那种复杂而悦耳的节奏，……总之，每一个派别的舞蹈，每一种音乐，都是具有那末高度的、那末细致的表现方法。这不是短时间可以形成的，这无疑是悠久文化传统的结果。欣赏了我们的亲近的友人们的艺术，深深使我感觉到，我们应当向他们学习，把他们这些在人类文化上优美的创造学习过来，丰富我们的艺术，并且增进我们之间心的深处的友谊。
    但同时，我又觉得，印度的音乐舞蹈艺术，对我们也并不是完全陌生的，在他们好些表演中，我们看出了和我国艺术极其相似的地方。卡塔卡利舞在舞蹈上的戏剧表现力和我国的古典戏曲艺术是多么相似：他们有自己的基本舞汇，为了表现不同的人物创造了不同的动作体系，而且这些动作体系又是如何细致、准确和富于典型性，只要掌握了这些动作而加以运用，立刻就能在我们面前出现生动的人物形象。同样，在他们基本舞汇的基础上，可以表达出丰富细致的内心感情来。从这些我们可以看出这个舞蹈的高度的戏剧表现力。此外还有乐器，特别是打击乐器的伴奏法，它们对于强调动作节奏和强调感情的气氛和它的变化上所起的重要作用，也是和我们的古典戏曲极端相似的。面具的运用（我们则是脸谱），服装的鲜明和浓厚的装饰性，这也是我们在原则上相似的地方。
    在我们中国歌舞戏曲史上，记载着自南北朝至五代这一个悠长的时间里吸收了我们邻邦印度这方面许多的滋养料，又经过我们的融化和创造，使它们加入到我们固有的艺术中来，完全混成一体，形成了我们所特有的古典戏曲。然而中、印两种富有鲜明民族色彩的艺术，至今天仍能认出它们之间的相互影响。这种相互的影响，无疑地给我们已往的深厚友谊作了永远光辉的证人。
    现在我们两个亲密的邻邦在新的世界上重又巍然地站起来了，我们的艺术重又发出、而且将要更强烈地发出它们的光芒；我们两国的艺术家重又聚会在一堂。我觉得没有任何东西可以阻止我们强烈的愿望：学习他们的艺术，学习他们具有悠久传统的、在严格训练和高度技巧基础上的，因而具有丰富表现力和感染力的艺术。我觉得我们新中国的艺术应当吸收世界上最好的滋养来丰富它，而印度艺术正是其中重要的一种。
    我对于印度的艺术知道得太少，我很遗憾由于我对于印度语言的无知，不能全部体会他们艺术的妙谛，但我希望我们能更多地理解它，学习它。
    印度文化代表团的访问和演出，已经在中国人民的心中留下了不可磨灭的印象。这亚洲两大民族之间的、在相互尊重、相互支持、相互学习的基础上发展起来的文化交流，一定会更进一步的促进我们从古以来就曾存在的友谊，而这种友谊和合作，正就是亚洲和世界和平的重要的因素。
