We will participate in the consultation conference in a spirit of seeking truth from facts and without any prejudice, so that this conference can achieve satisfactory results.

When talking about the supervision of general elections, Phạm Văn Đồng said: Article 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulates that within July 1956, Vietnam will hold general elections under the supervision of an international committee composed of representatives of the member states of the International Supervisory and Control Commission. This refers to the representatives of India, Canada, and Poland.

Phạm Văn Đồng finally emphasized that the Vietnamese people are determined to fight to consolidate peace, strive for the convening of consultation conferences, and realize Vietnam's general elections and unification.
