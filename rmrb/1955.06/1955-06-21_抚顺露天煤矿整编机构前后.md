    Reorganization of Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine Before and After
    Yi Zhi
    Many facts have proven that only by combining institutional reorganization with work improvement can the goal of both drawing personnel and improving work efficiency be achieved. The reorganization of the Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine once again proves this point.
    In recent years, the Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine has undergone several reorganizations, but because they were not combined with work improvement, the results were not significant. The bloated management structure and the phenomenon of overstaffing remained very serious, while the strength of the production and technical departments was very weak. Most of the technical personnel above the level of assistant engineer were concentrated in the offices of the management structure, while the entire mine had only one comprehensive technical office to guide production. This fell far short of meeting the needs of a dispersed operating environment and complex production tasks. Due to the large and bloated management structure, the work styles of bureaucracy and red tape arose. In the first quarter of last year, the coal mining section needed to add materials for making safety brakes for coal cars. This was not difficult to solve, but the official document requesting this matter traveled through the Mechanical and Electrical Section, the Planning Section, and the Materials Supply Section for more than two months. According to statistics, the documents issued by various sections in January of last year, from drafting, typing, printing, to transfer and storage, consumed the entire working days of more than fifty people in one month. These documents also consumed the time and energy of leading staff members all day long, preventing them from going deeper into the site to direct production.
    According to instructions from higher authorities and suggestions from Soviet experts, the Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine underwent another more comprehensive reorganization. In order to dispel the concerns of management personnel and effectively improve work, the entire mine organized four professional teams in financial cost, material supply, statistics, and documentation to conduct in-depth inspections to discover overlapping organizations and manpower waste, and to propose improvement opinions in connection with improving business and strengthening production departments. Then, ideological mobilization was carried out within and outside the Party, the reorganization plan was announced, and the reorganization was implemented. After this reorganization, the phenomenon of overlapping management structures in the entire mine was greatly reduced, and work methods were also improved. For example, the original statistical organization was divided into three levels: mine, workshop, and district, and there were also business statistics in the sections. After the reorganization, the section business statistics were merged into the mine's comprehensive statistics, and the district statistics were merged into the workshop's statistics. This greatly simplified the statistical organization and reduced the number of statistical staff. For example, before the reorganization, the material supply work implemented a material requisition system, placing the main responsibility for material work on the workshop, and the mine's equipment and material supply section actually did very little material management work. The workshop wanted as much as it needed, and the equipment and material supply section supplied as much as it was asked. As a result, material quotas increased greatly, and black market materials occurred continuously. After the reorganization, the method of delivering materials from the equipment and material supply section to the workshop was adopted, and a material dispatching organization was established to supervise ordering, picking up, delivering and solving materials needed urgently for production when inventory was insufficient. Material supply personnel often took the initiative to go deep into workshops and construction sites to understand material needs, make preparations in advance, and carry out planned supply. This improvement not only simplified the eight procedures for requisitioning materials into four, but also saved one hundred and thirty-three material clerks, requisition personnel, and warehouse keepers.
    With the simplification of institutions, the reduction of personnel, and the improvement of work methods, the work styles of bureaucracy and red tape have also changed. In the first month after the reorganization, January of this year, the total number of official documents in the entire mine decreased by 41% compared with the same period last year, and the average time for processing official documents was also shortened by 43%. Due to the reduction of official documents, the leading staff of the management department were also able to go deeper into the site to discover and solve problems more frequently. For example, in early March, the coal mining department conducted a detailed investigation and study of the mining and transportation system, and adopted three measures, including reducing the transportation volume of the 19th section, which initially solved the problem of imbalance in the transportation volume in the pit and in the main roadways.
    This reorganization transferred 329 staff members from the entire mine's management structure, and also reduced 150 non-production personnel in canteens, nurseries, and residences. This greatly saved the expense of administrative management.
    This reorganization also paid attention to strengthening the production departments, and established three production command headquarters for stripping, coal mining, and mechanical and electrical engineering in accordance with the production characteristics of the entire mine. In addition to solving the needs of a certain key project for cadres, the transferred personnel also supplemented thirty technically capable technical and management personnel to workshops and major production areas. These workshops will soon be able to establish a system of workshop chief engineers and mechanics.
    For half a year, the newly established production technology command organization has shown its role in strengthening production leadership. Taking the coal mining department as an example, since the beginning of this year, it has twice investigated the technical and management reasons for the high rate of coal loss and formulated measures to increase the coal recovery rate. After implementing measures such as the piece-rate wage system based on coal type in the lower panel area of the coal mining section, it can recover 10,000 tons of good coal for the country in one year.

    抚顺露天煤矿整编机构前后
    逸之
    整编机构只有结合改进工作，才能达到既抽调了人员又提高了工作效率的目的，这是很多事实证明了的。抚顺露天煤矿的整编又一次证明了这个道理。
    几年来，抚顺露天煤矿进行过多次整编，但因没有和改进工作结合起来，收效不大。管理机构的臃肿，人浮于事的现象仍然非常严重，而生产技术机构的力量却十分薄弱。助理工程师以上的技术人员大部分集中在管理机构的科室里，而全矿只有一个综合指导生产的技术室。这就远远不能满足作业环境分散、生产任务复杂的需要。由于管理机构的庞大臃肿，文牍主义和官僚主义的作风便应运而生。去年第一季度采煤段要追加制作煤车安全踩闸的材料，这本来并不难解决，但请求办理这件事的公文在机电科、计划科、器材供应科竟辗转旅行了两个多月。据统计，去年一月各科室所发出的文件，从拟稿、打字、印刷、转递、保管，在一个月内要耗费五十个人以上的全部工作日。这些文件也在成天耗费着领导工作人员的时间和精力，使他们不能更多地深入现场指挥生产。
    根据上级指示和苏联专家建议，抚顺露天煤矿又进行了一次比较全面的整编。为了解除管理人员的顾虑，切实改进工作，全矿组织了财务成本、材料供应、统计和文书四个专业小组深入检查，去发现机构重叠，人力浪费的现象，并联系改进业务，加强生产部门提出改进意见。接着，在党内党外进行思想动员，宣布整编方案，实行整编。经过这次整编，全矿管理机构重叠的现象大大减少，工作方法也有了改进。例如原来的统计机构分成矿、车间和区三级，另外科室也有业务统计。整编以后把科室业务统计并入矿的综合统计，区的统计并入车间的统计。这就大大简化了统计的机构和减少了统计工作人员。再如整编以前的材料供应工作实行的是领料制，把材料工作的主要责任放在车间，矿的器材供应科实际很少作材料管理工作，车间要多少，器材供应科就供应多少，结果材料定额大量增加，黑料不断发生。整编以后，采取了由器材供应科向车间送料的办法，并成立了材料调度机构，监督订货、提货、送料工作和解决生产急需而库存不足的材料。材料供应人员则经常主动深入车间和工地，了解材料需要，事先作好储备，进行有计划的供应。这一改进，不仅把领用材料的八道手续简化成了四道，并且节省了一百三十三名材料员、领料员和保管员。
    随着机构的简化，人员的减少和工作方法的改进，文牍主义和官僚主义的作风也有了转变。整编以后的第一个月，今年一月全矿的公文总件数就比去年同期减少了百分之四十一，处理公文的时间平均也缩短了百分之四十三。由于公文的减少，管理部门的领导工作人员也有可能更多地深入现场发现问题和解决问题了。例如，三月上旬，采煤部就对采掘运输系统进行了一次详细的调查研究，采取了减轻十九段运输量等三项措施，这就使得坑内和大巷运输量不平衡的问题获得初步解决。
    这次整编，从全矿管理机构中抽调了三百二十九名工作人员，食堂、托儿所、住宅等非生产人员也减少了一百五十名。这就大量节省了行政管理费的开支。
    这次整编还注意加强了生产部门，按照全矿的生产特征成立了剥离、采煤、机电三个生产指挥部。被抽调的人员除部分解决了某重点工程所需要的干部，还把三十名能力较强的技术人员和管理人员充实到车间和主要生产区。这些车间，不久之后就可以建立起车间主管工程师和机械师的制度。
    半年以来，新建立的生产技术指挥机构，已显示出它加强了对生产领导的作用。即以采煤部为例，今年以来，它曾两次调查了造成煤损失率高的技术方面和管理方面的原因，制定了提高煤回收率的措施。只在采煤段下盘区实现按煤种计件工资制度等措施后，一年即可为国家回收好煤一万吨。
