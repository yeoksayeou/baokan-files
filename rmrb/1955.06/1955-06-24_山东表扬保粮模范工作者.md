    Shandong Commends Model Grain Preservation Workers
    Shandong Province held its first Model Grain Preservation Representatives Conference from June 13th to 18th. The meeting exchanged work experiences and commended a group of outstanding model grain preservation workers.
      In 1954, more than 1,000 model workers and more than 100 model warehouses emerged in the grain departments of Shandong Province. The model workers included custodians, accountants, salespersons, dispatchers, and statisticians. Gao Xueyu, director of the Weizihe Grain Depot in Dongping County, led all the staff of the grain depot to study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and no grain mildew accidents occurred for three years. In 1954, it became a grain depot free of insects, mildew, rodents, sparrows, and accidents. Li Zhan'ao, custodian of the Gaojiaying Branch of the 13th District Grain Depot in Anqiu County, earnestly implemented the grain preservation policy of "prevention is better than cure," strictly grasped the quality of grain entering the warehouse, and stored it according to quality. As a result, no grain mildew, deterioration, theft, or fire accidents have occurred in the warehouse where he works for four years. Compared with the provincial average, the cost of grain storage for the whole year of 1954 was saved by more than 1,500 yuan. Because these model grain preservation workers took the lead in promoting the emergence of 1,124 insect-free grain depots throughout the province in 1954, reducing grain loss, and the phenomenon of grain mildew and deterioration decreased by 43.57% compared with 1953.
    Through this meeting, Shandong's grain preservation movement will be further developed. (Reported by our reporter in Jinan)

    山东表扬保粮模范工作者
    山东省在六月十三日到十八日举行了第一届保粮模范代表大会。会上交流了工作经验，表扬了一批优秀的保粮模范。
      一九五四年，山东省粮食部门出现了一千多名模范工作者，一百多个模范仓库。模范工作者中有保管人员、会计人员、营业员、调运员、统计员等。东平县苇子河粮库主任高学雨，领导全粮库工作人员学习苏联先进经验，三年未发生粮食霉烂事故，
  一九五四年成为无虫、无霉、无鼠雀和无事故的粮库。安邱县十三区粮库高家营分仓保管员李占熬，认真执行“防重于治”的保粮方针，严格掌握入库粮食质量，分质保管，因而在他所工作的仓库中，四年来未发生粮食霉烂、变质、被盗、失火等事故；一九五四年全年保管粮食费用和全省平均数比较，节约一千五百多元。由于这些保粮模范工作者带头推动一九五四年全省出现了无虫粮库一千一百二十四处，降低了粮食损耗，粮食霉烂变质现象较
  一九五三年减少了百分之四十三点五七。
    通过这次会议，山东的保粮运动将得到进一步的开展。　（本报驻济南记者）
