	The first mechanized farm in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province is the state-owned Huangyang River Mechanized Farm, newly built this year in Wuwei County. Its southern part is only a dozen kilometers away from the Lanxin Railway, and its northern part is adjacent to the edge of the Tengger Desert. The entire farm has more than 190,000 mu of land.

	Standing on the ancient Great Wall and looking out, the flat land of the Huangyang River Mechanized Farm stretches inside and outside the Great Wall. In the past, this was a sparsely populated wilderness, but now it has become vibrant. Hundreds of farm workers are leveling land, building canals, constructing houses, and cultivating orchards. Several main and branch canals that have already been dug are drawing snow water from the Qilian Mountains to irrigate the farm's wasteland and crops. More than 8,600 "Guoguang," "Huangyuan Shuai," "Jiguan" and other excellent varieties of apples and 13,000 "Rose Fragrant" good grape seedlings planted this spring have grown tender green branches. A 12-li shelterbelt has been built on the edge of the desert in the northwest of the farm. More than 1,300 mu of wheat and other crops planted on newly reclaimed land this spring are growing very well.

	This year, the farm plans to level land, reclaim wasteland, and expand the irrigated area by more than 10,000 mu each, and build 1,700 square meters of houses. After the mechanized farm is fully established, it will establish seven operation stations, implement a regular grass-crop rotation system, build protective forest networks along both sides of the irrigation canals, and establish pastures of more than 39,000 mu to raise fine breeds of dairy cows and pigs. Orchards and vegetable fields will be developed to 5,000 mu to 20,000 mu.

    河西走廊上的第一个机械农场
    新华社记者　马林周
    甘肃省河西走廊上出现了第一个机械农场，那就是今年在武威县新建成的国营黄羊河机械农场。它的南部距离兰新铁路只有十多公里，北部和腾格里沙漠的边沿相毗连，全场共拥有十九万多亩土地。
    站在古长城上眺望，黄羊河机械农场平坦的土地在长城内外伸展着。过去这里是人烟罕见的荒野，现在已变得生气勃勃了。几百个农场工人正在平整土地，修建渠道，建筑房屋和抚育果园。已经挖好的几条干渠和支渠，正在引祁连山的雪水灌溉农场的荒地和农作物。今年春季栽培的八千六百多株“国光”、“黄元帅”、“鸡冠”等优良品种的苹果和一万三千株“玫瑰香”良种葡萄已生出嫩绿的枝条。在农场西北的沙漠边缘已营造防沙林带十二华里。春季在新垦的土地上种植的一千三百多亩小麦等农作物，生长很好。
    今年农场计划平整土地、开垦荒地和扩大灌溉面积各一万多亩，建筑房屋一千七百平方公尺。待这个机械农场完全定型后，它将要建立七个作业站，要实行正规的草田轮作制度，在灌溉渠道两旁要营造起护田林网，还要建立起三万九千多亩地的牧场饲养良种奶牛和猪，果园和菜地将发展到五千亩到两万亩。
