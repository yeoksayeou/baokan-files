Visiting President Ho Chi Minh's Hometown
By Our Correspondent Zhan Chao

The hometown of President Ho Chi Minh, the great leader of the Vietnamese people and the best friend of the Chinese people, is Kim Lien village, Nam Lien commune, Nam Dan district, Nghe An province in central Vietnam.

President Ho Chi Minh was born there in 1890 and spent his childhood in his hometown. At the age of twelve, he left with his father and began his revolutionary career. For decades, President Ho Chi Minh has been traveling and fighting tirelessly for the liberation, independence, and unity of his country, and for the peace, freedom, and happiness of his people. Until now, he has not had the opportunity to return to his hometown even once.

Kim Lien village, Nam Lien commune, is located in the west of Nghe An province, about thirteen kilometers away from "Vinh City," the capital of Nghe An province. Highway No. 4 from central Vietnam to Laos passes by the village. Originally, the path into the village was just a small path through the fields, but recently the farmers have automatically filled it in to make a motor road. Small jeeps can now drive all the way to the big tree in front of the house where President Ho Chi Minh lived as a child.

In fact, the house where President Ho Chi Minh lived as a child has changed hands several times, and the style of the house has also changed a lot. After liberation, with the help of the local people, the Republic government rebuilt a house on the old site that was similar to the house where President Ho Chi Minh lived as a child, based on the memories of the elderly. The house faces east, sitting on a rectangular earth foundation. It has wooden pillars, earthen walls, plank windows, and a thatched roof. The whole house is divided into three rooms, with simple and unadorned furnishings. In the first room, a purplish-black rectangular table in the center and a wooden plank bed under the north window were where President Ho Chi Minh did his homework and slept with his father as a child. The second and third rooms were the bedrooms of President Ho Chi Minh's sister and the place for storing things.

President Ho Chi Minh's childhood name was Nguyen Sinh Cung. His father, Nguyen Sinh Sac, was a poor but patriotic scholar. He studied hard by himself while herding cattle in his childhood, and later passed the imperial examination. He was once appointed as a county magistrate, but because he was dissatisfied with the feudal royal family's betrayal of the country and the reactionary rule of the French colonists, he abandoned his official position and fled with Nguyen Sinh Cung. He gave all two acres of ancestral land to the poor farmers without compensation, traveled around, made a living by teaching and practicing medicine, and actively participated in the patriotic movement at that time.

President Ho Chi Minh's parents passed away long ago, and his elder brother, Nguyen Sinh Khiem, and elder sister, Nguyen Thi Thanh, also passed away in 1950 and 1953 respectively. Now, only a paternal cousin, Nguyen Sinh Phuc, and a distant younger brother, Nguyen Sinh Vien, are left in the village. In addition, there are some friends of President Ho Chi Minh's childhood who live nearby, all in their sixties or seventies. They recalled the days they spent with President Ho Chi Minh with excitement. At that time, everyone went out to herd cattle together. The young Ho Chi Minh—Nguyen Sinh Cung—was very lively, and he often played meaningful games. It is said that once, the teacher personally sent Nguyen Sinh Cung home and said to his father: "I can't teach this child anymore, he is smarter than the teacher!"

Young Nguyen Sinh Cung was not only known for his intelligence and amazing memory, but also for his high degree of sympathy for the weak and his tireless pursuit of truth. Once, when he was not even ten years old, Nguyen Sinh Cung asked his grandmother's nephew, Ha Tuan, such a question: "Uncle, why is there thunder and lightning in the sky?" Ha Tuan was stumped and said: "Nephew, I have to admit defeat!" But Nguyen Sinh Cung was not satisfied with this, he said: "I will definitely find out." Ha Tuan is still alive, already an eighty-year-old man with white hair, living in a village about one kilometer away from Kim Lien village. When we visited him, he talked with relish about many interesting stories of Ho Chi Minh—Nguyen Sinh Cung—in his childhood.

At the age of twelve, Nguyen Sinh Cung left his hometown with his father. They passed through many cities and villages, personally feeling the suffering of the people and the pain of the motherland being enslaved by foreign invaders. Therefore, this young man's young heart made a great aspiration to dedicate his whole life to his motherland and people. From then on, he changed his name to "Nguyen Ai Quoc."

When the name Nguyen Ai Quoc was spread to his hometown, the old people there said: "This child is really promising!"

At that time, in order to resist the French colonialists' aggression and seek national freedom and independence, many people with lofty ideals in Vietnam carried out heroic struggles and worked hard to explore the road to liberation. The general intellectuals, led by Phan Boi Chau, advocated imitating Japan and sent a group of young people to study in Japan. Because Phan Boi Chau's father was a lifelong friend of Nguyen Ai Quoc's father, he also planned to take Nguyen Ai Quoc with him, but Nguyen Ai Quoc decided not to go. Although he admired Phan Boi Chau very much, he disagreed with the path taken by Phan Boi Chau.

The young Nguyen Ai Quoc was determined to find a correct path to liberation for the motherland and the people. In 1912, he went from central Vietnam to Saigon to prepare to go abroad for investigation. One day, Nguyen Ai Quoc suddenly asked his partner: "Please tell me, do you like our country?" His partner was a little surprised and said: "Of course I like it!" Nguyen Ai Quoc continued: "Can you keep a secret?" His partner said: "I promise you." Nguyen Ai Quoc said: "I want to go, I am going to visit France and other countries soon. After inspecting how they do it, I will come back to help our compatriots." His partner asked somewhat suspiciously: "Where do we get the travel expenses from?" Nguyen Ai Quoc smiled and stretched out his arms and said: "The money is here! We can work, we live and travel by labor."

Soon, Nguyen Ai Quoc used an alias and worked as a second-class handyman in the kitchen on a ship bound for France. Later, he did the same thing on another ship. For a period of time, he also cut grass in the villas of nobles. From 1912 to 1917, Nguyen Ai Quoc used such opportunities to go to France, England, Africa, Europe, and some parts of the Americas. The labor he undertook was heavy, but the wages were very meager, and the main part of the wages was used for learning languages and buying books and newspapers, and sometimes for helping compatriots stranded overseas. Whenever the ship docked, Nguyen Ai Quoc tried his best to squeeze out time to go to the libraries in Paris and London to read books and newspapers about the national revolutionary movement. For the sake of the motherland and the people, Nguyen Ai Quoc ignored all difficulties, hardships, pains, and fatigue.

In 1918, after the end of World War I, Nguyen Ai Quoc settled in Paris and worked hard in the practical work of national liberation, giving lectures, distributing leaflets, organizing the "Colonial Union," and founding the "Paris Weekly." It was during this period that the world's first socialist country was born in Russia, and the French workers' movement developed vigorously. Nguyen Ai Quoc believed that only Marxism-Leninism could correctly guide the national liberation movement, and only the working-class party armed with Marxism-Leninism could lead the oppressed nations to gain freedom and independence. So he resolutely joined the French Socialist Party, and at the Tours Conference when the Socialist Party split, he stood on the side of the majority, stood on the position of Marxism-Leninism, and voted in favor of joining the Third International. The young Nguyen Ai Quoc answered a comrade's question at that time, saying: "The Third International solemnly discusses the colonial issue, they talk about helping the oppressed nations to fight for freedom and independence. As for the Second International, they do not mention the fate of the colonies. That is why I voted in favor of the Third International. To fight for freedom for my compatriots, to fight for independence for my motherland, that is what I want."

In 1923, Nguyen Ai Quoc, as the representative of the first Marxist-Leninist in Indochina, went to Moscow to participate in the Third International Conference and personally inspected the Soviet people's work of restoration and construction with full confidence under the difficult conditions of imperialist encirclement. Soon, Nguyen Ai Quoc came to Guangzhou, China, witnessed the entire progress of the Chinese Revolution, and gathered and trained Vietnamese revolutionary cadres. In 1930, under the leadership of Nguyen Ai Quoc, the three Vietnamese communist organizations were unified to form the Indochinese Communist Party. From then on, the Vietnamese national liberation movement opened a completely new page in history.

The French imperialists were very afraid of Nguyen Ai Quoc's influence among the Vietnamese people. They arrested and imprisoned Nguyen Ai Quoc several times and repeatedly spread rumors that he had died of illness, etc., but each time, the imperialists had to issue orders again to arrest Nguyen Ai Quoc, who had managed to escape. The people of Kim Lien village, Nam Lien commune, the hometown of Nguyen Ai Quoc, could not help but laugh secretly every time they heard or saw this contradictory "circular," and told each other knowingly: "He will not die." The same words were also circulating throughout Vietnam.

In order to avoid the pursuit of the imperialists and their lackeys, Nguyen Ai Quoc often disguised himself and changed his name. "Ho Chi Minh" was the last name he changed to. In 1945, when the Vietnamese people's "August Revolution" was successful, Bao Dai learned that Ho Chi Minh was Nguyen Ai Quoc.

For twenty-five years, the Vietnam Workers' Party, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, has been ingeniously using the weapon of Marxism-Leninism, combining it with the revolutionary reality of Vietnam, and leading the Vietnamese people from victory to victory: it was the first to establish an independent democratic republic in a colonial country; after a long and arduous war of resistance, it won the historic victory of Dien Bien Phu in May 1954, stopping the conspiracy of US imperialism to continue to prolong and expand the war, and restoring peace to Vietnam and Indochina. Now, it is continuing to work tirelessly to consolidate peace, achieve unity, and complete independence and democracy.

The people of President Ho Chi Minh's hometown, who had just overcome the continuous nine months of water and drought disasters, warmly received us and excitedly told us about President Ho Chi Minh's deeds. They expressed that as the people of Ho Chi Minh's hometown, they felt extremely honored and wanted to resolutely respond to the call of President Ho, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Republic government, actively increase production, and contribute more strength to consolidating the north, consolidating peace, and striving to achieve national unification through general elections. When we ended this meaningful visit and said goodbye to the people of President Ho Chi Minh's hometown, they repeatedly urged us to convey their respect to the Chinese people, their brothers.

    访问胡志明主席故乡
    本报记者  展潮
    越南人民伟大的领袖、中国人民最好的朋友胡志明主席，他的故乡在越南中部的义安省南檀县南莲社金莲村。
    胡志明主席一八九零年在那里诞生，并且在故乡度过了他的童年，到十二岁的时候随父亲外出，从此就开始了他革命者的生涯。几十年来，为了祖国的解放、独立和统一，为了人民的和平、自由和幸福，胡志明主席到处奔走，奋斗不息，一直到现在，他还没有机会回到故乡去过一次。
    南莲社金莲村，在义安省的西边，离义安省省会“荣市”约十三公里，从越南中部到老挝去的第四号公路打村边经过，往村里走原来只是一段田野小径，最近农民们已经自动把它填成一条汽车路，坐小吉普车可以一直到达胡志明主席童年时代住宅门前的大树下。
    其实，胡志明主席童年时代的住宅已经易手好几次了，房子的样式也有了很大的改变。解放后，共和国政府在当地人民协助下，按照老年人记忆里的样子，在旧址上重新建筑起一座胡志明主席童年时代的住宅。住宅坐西朝东，在一块长方形的土台基上，木柱、土墙、板窗、茅顶，全宅分作三间，陈设简单朴素。在头一间房子里，正当中的一张紫黑色长方桌和靠北窗下的一张木板床，就是胡志明主席童年时代随父亲作功课和睡眠的地方；第二和第三间房子，是胡志明主席姐姐当年的寝室和储存东西的地方。
    胡志明主席童年时代的名字叫阮生功。父亲阮升式，是一位清寒的爱国志士，幼年当牧童时刻苦自学，后来考中了举人，曾被委任作县知事，因为不满封建皇室的卖国和法国殖民者的反动统治，带着阮生功抛冠出奔，走时把祖辈遗留下来的两亩田全都无偿地分给了穷苦的农民，四处漂游，靠教学和行医度日，并积极参加当时的爱国运动。
    胡志明主席父母早已去世了，哥哥阮生谦、姐姐阮氏清，也都在一九五零、一九五三年先后逝世。现在，村子里只剩下一位堂叔伯哥哥阮生福和一位远房弟弟阮生远。此外，还有一些住在左近的胡志明主席童年时代的朋友，都是六、七十岁的人了，他们怀着兴奋的心情追忆着过去和胡志明主席相处的日子。那时候大家一起出去牧放，童年的胡志明——阮生功是很活泼的，他常做些有意义的游戏。据说有一次，老师亲自把阮生功送到家里，对他父亲说：“这孩子我不能再教了，他聪明胜过老师！”
    年幼的阮生功不仅以聪明和具有惊人的记忆力见称，而且他具有对弱小者高度的同情心和对真理孜孜不倦的追求精神。有一次，还不到十岁的阮生功，向他祖母的侄子何俊提出这样的问题：“叔叔，天上为什么响雷、闪电？”何俊被难住了，说：“侄子，我只好认输了！”可是阮生功并不以此为满足，他说：“一定会弄清楚的。”何俊现在还健在，已经是须发皆白的八十岁的人了，住在离金莲村约有一公里的庄子里，当我们去访问的时候，他津津有味地谈起了童年时代的胡志明——阮生功许多有趣的故事。
    十二岁那年，阮生功随着父亲远离故乡，他们经过许多城市和乡村，亲身感受着人民的灾难，感受着祖国被外来侵略者奴役的痛苦，于是这位少年的稚小的心立下了伟大的志愿，要把整个生命贡献给自己的祖国和人民，他从此改名为“阮爱国”。
    当阮爱国的名字传到故乡的时候，那里的老年人都说：“这孩子真有出息！”
    那时候，越南人民为了反抗法国殖民者的侵略，为了谋求民族的自由和独立，许多仁人志士前仆后继地进行着英勇的斗争，努力在探索着解放的道路。以潘佩珠为首的一般知识分子，主张仿效日本，并选派一批青年到日本去留学，潘佩珠因为和阮爱国父亲是生前友好，也准备把阮爱国带去，可是阮爱国决意不去，他虽然很钦佩潘佩珠，但对潘佩珠所采取的途径却不以为然。
    年轻的阮爱国决心要为祖国和人民寻找一条正确的解放的道路。一九一二年他从中越到了西贡，准备出国去考察。有一天，阮爱国突然问他的伙伴说：“请你告诉我，你喜欢我们的国家吗？”他的伙伴感到有点惊讶说：“当然喜欢！”阮爱国接着说：“你可以保守一个秘密吗？”他的伙伴说：“我答应你。”阮爱国说：“我想去，我快要去观光法国和别的国家。视察他们怎样做之后，我将回来帮助我们的同胞。”他的伙伴有些怀疑地问：“我们从那里取得旅费呢？”阮爱国微笑地伸出双臂说：“钱就在这里！我们可以工作，我们靠劳力来生活和旅行。”
    不久，阮爱国就用了一个别名，在一只开往法国去的轮船上做厨房的二等杂役，后来他又在另一只轮船上做同样的事情，有一个时期他还在贵族的别墅里剪草。从一九一二年到一九一七年，阮爱国就利用这样的机会到过法国、英国、非洲、欧洲以及美洲的一些地方，他所担负的劳作是繁重的，工资却十分菲薄，而工资的主要部分又拿来作为学习语文和购买书报的费用，有时还帮助流落在海外的同胞。每当轮船靠岸，阮爱国都尽量挤出时间到巴黎、伦敦的图书馆里去阅读有关民族革命运动的书报。为了祖国，为了人民，一切艰难、困苦、病痛、劳累，阮爱国都置之度外。
    一九一八年，第一次世界大战结束后，阮爱国在巴黎定居期间，努力从事民族解放的实际工作，讲演、印发传单、组织“殖民地联合会”、创办“巴黎周报”等。正是这个期间，世界上第一个社会主义的国家在俄国诞生了，法国的工人运动蓬勃发展，阮爱国认定唯有马克思、列宁主义才能正确指导民族的解放运动，唯有以马克思、列宁主义武装起来的工人阶级的政党才能领导被压迫的民族获得自由独立，于是他毅然地参加了法国社会党，并在都尔会议社会党分裂时，站在多数派方面，站在马克思、列宁主义的立场上，投票赞成参加第三国际。年轻的阮爱国当时回答一位同志的问题时说：“第三国际很郑重地讨论殖民地问题，他们谈论帮助被压迫的民族争取自由和独立。至于第二国际，他们都不提及殖民地的命运。这就是我为什么投票赞成第三国际的原因。为我的同胞争取自由，为我的祖国争取独立，这就是我所想望的。”
    一九二三年，阮爱国以印度支那第一个马克思、列宁主义者代表的身分，到莫斯科去参加第三国际会议，并且亲自考察苏联人民满怀信心地在帝国主义包围的艰苦条件下从事恢复建设工作。不久，阮爱国来到了中国的广州，目击中国大革命的全部进展过程，并且集合和训练了越南的革命干部。一九三零年，在阮爱国的主持下，越南三个共产主义团体统一成立印度支那共产党，从此，越南民族解放运动揭开了历史上完全新的一页。
    法帝国主义非常害怕阮爱国在越南人民群众中的影响，几次三番逮捕监禁阮爱国，并且一再散播谣言，说他已经病死等等，但是每次，帝国主义者不得不再发出命令，通缉设法逃脱了的阮爱国。阮爱国的故乡南莲社金莲村的人民，每次听到或看到这种矛盾的“通令”的时候，都不禁暗笑，互相会意地相告：“他是不会死的。”同样的话，也在越南各地流传着。
    为了避免帝国主义及其走卒的追捕，阮爱国经常化装，更换姓名，“胡志明”就是他更换的最后一个名字。一九四五年，越南人民“八月革命”成功的时候，保大才打听到胡志明就是阮爱国。
    以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党及其前身印度支那共产党，二十五年来，天才地运用着马克思、列宁主义这一武器，使它和越南的革命实际相结合，领导着越南人民从胜利走向胜利：第一个在殖民地的国家里建立起独立的民主共和国；经过长期艰苦的抗战，一九五四年五月取得了奠边府历史性的胜利，制止了美帝国主义继续延长和扩大战争的阴谋，重新恢复了越南和印度支那的和平。现在，它正继续为巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主而不懈地努力着。
    刚战胜了连续九个月的水、旱灾的胡志明主席故乡的人民，热情地接待我们，兴奋地向我们叙述胡志明主席的事迹，他们表示作为胡志明故乡的人民感到无比地光荣，要坚决响应胡主席、越南劳动党和共和国政府的号召，积极增加生产，为巩固北部、巩固和平、争取以普选来实现全国的统一，贡献更多的力量。在我们结束这次有意义的访问、向胡志明主席故乡的人民告别的时候，他们一再叮嘱我们一定要转达他们对中国人民的兄弟的敬意。
