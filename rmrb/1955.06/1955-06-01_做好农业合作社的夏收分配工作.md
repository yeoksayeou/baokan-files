Do a Good Job in the Summer Harvest Distribution Work of Agricultural Cooperatives
    Lü Jianzhong
    The summer income distribution work of agricultural production cooperatives this year is very complex. This is not only because there are more cooperatives in various places than in the past, and they are more widely distributed; but also because a considerable number of newly established and expanded cooperatives have varying degrees of legacy problems and confusion. Some cooperatives have not resolved the issue of labor and land dividend ratios, or have not resolved it properly. Some cooperatives have not properly handled the labor, animal power, and investment spent by members in planting wheat before joining the cooperative. Some cooperatives have unreasonable labor allocation and work point calculation, and some cooperatives have chaotic accounts and poor production. All of these make the income distribution problem of agricultural cooperatives complicated.
    As the summer harvest season approaches, the attention of agricultural cooperative members has already focused on the distribution issue. Judging from the situation reflected in many areas of Henan Province, the members of agricultural cooperatives are still uncertain about how much grain they will receive, and many people are worried about suffering losses. They generally have the idea of "wait and see after the wheat harvest to decide whether to work hard or not." In Xuchang Prefecture, many cooperatives have very chaotic management work, and the summer harvest distribution has not yet been settled, which has already affected the production enthusiasm of the members. Some newly established cooperatives, due to the low assessment of land quality, do not take care of good seedlings, and some middle-peasant members want to harvest independently after the wheat is ripe. This problem has not been well handled and has already caused discord between some middle peasants and poor peasants, general members and key members within the cooperative. Bad elements have taken the opportunity to spread rumors, sabotage, and create confusion.
    It is worth noting that many staff members have not paid attention to this situation. Some staff members have underestimated the arduous and complex nature of this year's summer distribution work, and surprisingly believe that: with the cooperative charter and an accountant, it will be fine to calculate it when the time comes. Although some staff members feel that there are many problems, they are distressed because they lack experience and have no way to solve them. Some staff members are afraid of trouble and attempt to muddle through when the time comes.
    After learning about these situations, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a cadre meeting on summer distribution work in mid-May, pointing out that the summer distribution work of agricultural cooperatives is not only an arduous and complex organizational and technical work, but also a serious political task. It requires all localities to earnestly adhere to the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and to take doing a good job in the distribution of summer harvests as the central link in the current rectification and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. Based on the actual situation in the area, they absorbed everyone's opinions and formulated a summer distribution work plan for agricultural cooperatives. The plan put forward specific opinions on which situations are better to adopt the "whoever plants, harvests" method, and in which situations it is better to adopt the "seedlings enter the cooperative, unified management, and unified distribution" method, and what issues should be paid attention to when adopting different methods, and how to solve legacy problems and overcome chaotic phenomena.
    The Xuchang Prefectural Committee also required each cooperative to formulate a more specific distribution and advance payment plan for the cooperative, and to do a good job in preparing for the wheat harvest, so as to ensure distribution along with harvesting, so that members have a clear understanding of their income and improve production enthusiasm. At the meeting, it was also discussed to strengthen political and ideological education and security work for grassroots staff and the masses in the summer distribution and advance payment work, and to criticize the paralysis, passivity, and fear of hardship and trouble of some people. The Xuchang Prefectural Committee's approach is very necessary and timely, and other regions should refer to it.

    做好农业合作社的夏收分配工作
    吕建中
    今年夏季农业生产合作社的收益分配工作非常复杂。这不仅因为各地的社比过去数量多了、分布面更广了；而且因为其中有相当数量的新建的社和扩大的社，存在着不同程度的遗留问题和混乱现象。有些社的劳力土地分红比例问题没有解决或者解决得不妥当，有些社对社员入社前种麦耗费的劳力畜力和投资没有妥善处理，有些社的劳力支配和评工计分不合理，有些社账目混乱、生产搞得不好。这些都使得农业合作社的收益分配问题复杂起来。
    夏收季节日益迫近，农业合作社社员们的注意力已经集中到分配问题上来了。从河南省许多地区反映的情况来看，农业合作社社员们对自己究竟能分到多少粮食还是心中无数，很多人都耽心自己吃亏；他们普遍存着“干不干，麦后看”的想法。许昌专区有不少社管理工作很混乱，夏收分配还没有着落，已经影响到社员的生产积极性。有些新办的社，由于土地评产偏低，对青苗长得好的也不加以照顾，部分中农社员想在麦熟以后单独动手收割。这个问题没有得到很好的处理，已经引起一些中农和贫农、一般社员和社内骨干分子之间的不和；坏分子乘机造谣破坏，制造混乱。
    值得注意的是：很多工作人员对这种情况并没有重视起来。有些工作人员对今年夏季分配工作的艰巨复杂性估计不足，竟然认为：有社章，有会计，到时候一算就行了。有些工作人员虽然感觉问题很多，但因缺乏经验，苦于没有办法。有些工作人员怕麻烦，企图挨到时候，稀里糊涂一分了事。
    中共许昌地委了解了这些情况以后，就在五月中旬召开了夏季分配工作干部会议，指出农业合作社的夏季分配工作不仅是一项艰巨复杂的组织工作和技术工作，而且是一项严重的政治任务，要求各地切实坚持自愿互利原则，把做好夏季收获物的分配工作作为当前整顿巩固农业合作社的中心环节。他们根据当地的实际情况，吸收大家的意见，制定了农业合作社夏季分配工作方案。方案中对于在哪种情况下采用“谁种谁收”的办法较好，在哪种情况下采用“青苗入社、统一经营、统一分配”的办法较好，采用不同的办法都应注意一些什么问题，如何解决遗留问题、克服混乱现象，都提出了具体的意见。
    许昌地委还要求各个社制定本社的更具体的分配预借方案，做好麦收的准备工作，以保证随打随分，使社员对自己的收入心中有底，提高生产情绪。在会议上，还讨论了在夏季分配预借工作中要加强对基层工作人员和群众的政治思想教育工作和保卫工作，批判了某些人的麻痹、消极和怕艰苦怕麻烦的思想。许昌地委这样做是很必要和及时的，其他地区应该加以参考。
