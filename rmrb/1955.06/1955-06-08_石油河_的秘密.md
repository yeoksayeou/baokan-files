    The Secret of "Oil River"
    Xiao Gu
    Beside that narrow, fast-flowing river, people recently discovered a magical oil river. It was discovered by a nearby farmer quite by chance. One time, he saw the waves on the river surface glittering, and a large amount of oil, of unknown origin, was drifting over. A large area of the river was covered with shiny black crude oil. He followed the direction the oil was coming from and finally discovered that the oil was flowing out of this small river. On this strange river, a large amount of oil was constantly drifting out, especially in the afternoon during low tide. As the river water slowly receded, the oil thickly covered the surface of the small river, and the setting sun shone on the oil surface, reflecting colorful hues, like a rainbow in the sky.
    The discovery of this oil river, like those mysterious stories told in fairy tales, suddenly brought unexpected wealth to the residents of this area. The word spread quickly, and nearby villages were immediately in an uproar. Many people abandoned their original occupations and rushed here to collect oil: farmers who cultivated the land came, boatmen on the river came, people who set up noodle stalls at nearby wharves came, and small restaurant owners came... From then on, this quiet river became unusually noisy. Every afternoon, when the river water slowly receded during the sunset's afterglow, people carrying oil drums and long bamboo poles, young and old, came to the riverbank in groups. They threw hundreds of bamboo poles into the water to block the slowly flowing oil on the river surface, then carefully gathered it together and used special sieves with holes to scoop up the oil, filter out the water, and then pour the oil into oil drums.
    People's production methods were simple and backward, but because the river was rich in oil, their production volume was still considerable. Last year, in July and August, one person could collect forty or fifty jin in a day, and at least a dozen jin. This generous income suddenly changed people's lives. We only need to cite one person to understand how much this oil river has changed people's lives. - This person is called Huang Yaowen. Originally, his family was very poor, but one day a miracle happened: he was pleasantly surprised to find that his small house was facing the oil river, and the terrain was very favorable. So, he did not hesitate to set up a "production site" at his doorstep (that is, the riverbank), made a complete set of oil collecting tools, and organized his entire family, young and old, to go to the river to collect oil. From then on, his life improved day by day. At the end of last year, he spent seven or eight hundred yuan to build two new houses. This year, in March alone, he earned two hundred and seventy-six yuan and eighty jiao from collecting oil.
    Since people here are engaged in fuel production, of course, there needs to be commercial institutions to buy and sell these products. Therefore, shortly after the discovery of this oil river, private oil firms appeared here. Oil firm merchants came here by boat every few weeks to purchase oil. The purchase price was one or two jiao per jin. After the barrels of oil were transported to the city, this private oil firm resold the oil to another private oil refinery. According to incomplete statistics, from August last year to March this year, this refinery received more than 28,000 jin of oil. It can be seen that this oil river has also brought considerable profits to the capitalists who come by boat to buy oil.
    But where did this oil river come from? Was an oil stratum discovered along this riverbank? No, the most bizarre thing happened here: this large amount of oil did not come out of an underground oil layer, but from a state-owned oil refinery here. This is the whole secret of this oil river.
    Why didn't the oil from the refinery go into the oil depot, but into the river? According to the oil factory, there are two main reasons: one is that the oil residue was not recycled in time and accumulated too much, so it was washed out. They reviewed and said: This is because the management is not strict and the inspection and supervision are insufficient. This shows that there is still bureaucracy in our factory, and some comrades do not cherish state property enough. The second is that the factory's production has developed, and the original equipment is insufficient. Under these two reasons, oil was continuously poured into the river. We still cannot calculate how much oil has flowed away into this oil river to date. According to the factory, since July last year, there have been two times when the oil leakage was the most serious. One was in July last year, when a total of more than 5,400 kilograms of oil was leaked. The second time was in March this year, when more than 4,000 kilograms flowed away at once. However, according to the materials of relevant inspection departments, the oil that flowed away in July last year was not more than 5,000 kilograms, but about 30 tons; the oil that flowed out in March this year was not more than 4,000 kilograms, but more than 7,000 kilograms. In any case, the oil that flowed away in these two times was definitely a lot. According to nearby residents, during these two major oil leaks, the riverbank was almost filled with oil, and it flowed for three days and three nights. A resident named Huang Xianggen, who made a living by raising ducks, lost more than 100 ducks because the river was covered with oil and the ducks ate too much oil. Later, the factory compensated Huang Xianggen one hundred yuan. Some fields were irrigated with oily water, and the crops were also burned.
    Recently, the situation of this oil river has changed somewhat: the leaders of the factory have realized the seriousness of the oil leakage problem, so they announced that residents are not allowed to collect oil here anymore. But the oil is still flowing day and night, and the holes of "bureaucracy" and "some comrades not cherishing state property enough" have not been plugged. When we went here to investigate a few days ago, nearby residents also raised two questions to us: one is that because there is oil in the river, the river water cannot be drunk, and they have to go to faraway places to fetch water. The second is that the oily river water cannot be used for irrigation, and now it is the time when the fields urgently need water.
    There is no need for me to explain, everyone knows how important oil is to our country's industrial construction and national defense construction, and how much our country's increasingly growing cars, tractors, airplanes, etc. need it, and what does a large waste of oil mean!
    Please quickly plug this loophole that wastes national resources, and stop letting the precious "industrial blood" flood on this small river! (Attached picture)

    “石油河”的秘密
    萧谷
    在那狭窄的、水流湍急的江边，不久以前人们发现了一条神奇的石油河。这是一个附近的农民在一次很偶然的机会里发现的。有一次，他看见江面的波涛上亮闪闪的，不知从哪里漂来了大量的石油，一大片江水都被乌亮的原油遮没了。他沿着石油漂来的方向去寻找，最后才发现石油是从这条小河里流出来的。在这条奇异的小河上，不断地漂出大量的石油，尤其是在下午落潮时分，江水缓缓退了，石油就厚厚地浮满了这小河的水面，夕阳照在油面上，反射出五颜六色，仿佛天上的虹彩一般。
    这条石油河的发现，就像童话里讲述的那些神秘故事似的，突然给这一带的居民们送来了意想不到的财富。人们一传十，十传百，附近的村庄顿时喧嚷起来，许多人抛弃了原有的职业，赶到这里来捞油：种地的农民赶来了，这条江上的船民赶来了，在附近码头上摆面摊的也赶来了，开小菜馆的也赶来了……。从此这条冷静的小河就喧闹异常，每当下午江水缓缓退潮的时候，在夕阳的余晖里，人们提着油桶的，扛着长竹竿的，老老小小，成群结队地来到河边上，他们把成百根的竹竿抛到水里，把在河面上缓缓流动的石油拦阻住，然后小心翼翼地拨到一起，用有洞的特制小簸箕把油捞上来，把水滤掉，然后把油倒在油桶里。
    人们的生产方法是简单而落后的，但因为河里的石油很丰富，所以他们的生产数量仍然相当可观。去年七、八月间，一个人有的一天可以打捞四、五十斤，少的也可以打捞十几斤。这优厚的收入，使人们的生活顿然改观，我们只要举出其中的一个人，就可以了解到这条石油河给人们的生活带来了多么大的变化。——这个人叫黄耀文，原来家里很贫穷，但是有一天奇迹发生了：他惊喜地发现原来他的小屋子正面临着这条石油河，地形非常有利，于是他就毫不犹豫地在家门口（也就是河边）拦起了一个“生产场地”，制造了全套捞油的工具，组织全家老幼一齐到河边去捞油。从此，他的生活一天天好了起来，去年年底，他花了七、八百元盖起了两间新房子。今年仅三月份一个月，他就从捞油中得到了二百七十六元八角的收入。
    既然这里人们在进行燃料的生产，当然就需要有商业机构来收售这些产品。于是，在这条石油河发现不久后，这里就出现了私营油行，油行商人每隔一个时期，就撑一条船到这里来收购石油，收购价格是每斤人民币一角到二角，一桶桶的石油运到城里以后，这家私营油行又把油转售给另一家私营的炼油厂去炼油。据不完全的统计，从去年八月到今年三月，这家炼油厂共收进了石油二万八千多斤。可见这条石油河也给撑着船来收购石油的资本家带来了不少的利润。
    可是，这石油河是从哪里来的呢？是不是在这条江边发现了石油地层？不，最令人怪异的事情就在这里发生了：这大量的石油不是从地下油层里冒出来的，而是从这里的一家国营炼油厂里流出来的。这就是这条石油河的全部秘密所在。
    炼油厂的油为什么不送进油库，却送到河里来了呢？据这家油厂说主要原因有二，一是因为油脚未及时回收，积聚太多，因而被冲出，他们检讨说：这是因为管理不严格，检查督促不够所致，这说明我厂还存在官僚主义，并有些同志对国家财产不够爱护。二是因为工厂生产发展了，原有设备不敷应用。就在这两个原因下，石油源源不绝地倾注到了河里。这条石油河至今到底共流走了多少石油，我们还无法计算。据这家工厂说，从去年七月到现在，漏油最多的有二次，一次在去年七月间，共漏掉了油五千四百多公斤，第二次是今年三月，一下就流走了四千多公斤。但根据有关检查部门的材料，去年七月那次流掉的油不是五千多公斤，而是三十吨左右；今年三月间流出的油也不是四千多公斤，而是七千多公斤。不管怎样，这两次流走的油肯定是很多的，据附近的居民说，这两次大漏油的时候，这条河滨几乎就被石油灌满了，先后流了三天三晚。有一个叫黄祥根的居民，他是以养鸭为业的，这几天因为河上被油盖满了，鸭子吃多了油，死去了一百多只，后来工厂给黄祥根赔偿了一百元。有些田里用有油的水灌溉庄稼，庄稼也被烧坏了。
    最近，这条石油河的情况有了些变化：这家工厂的领导人已发现漏油问题的严重了，于是宣布了不准居民再来这里捞油。但是油仍然在日夜流着，“官僚主义”和“有些同志对国家财产不够爱护”的洞仍未堵塞。前几天我们去这里调查时，附近的居民还向我们提出了两个问题：一是由于河里有油，河水不能饮用，他们要跑到很远的地方去挑水喝。第二是有油的河水不能灌溉，而现在又是田里迫切需水的时候。
    用不着我来解说，谁都知道，石油对于我们国家工业建设和国防建设是多么重要，我们国家日益增多的汽车、拖拉机、飞机等等是多么需要它，大量浪费石油，是意味着什么！
    请赶快堵住这个浪费国家资源的窟窿，别再让宝贵的“工业血液”在这条小河上泛滥吧！（附图片）
