Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: A London radio broadcast reported by TASS from London on June 13th: West German Chancellor Adenauer flew from Bonn to the United States on the evening of the 12th.

According to an Associated Press reporter from Bonn, Adenauer will meet with President Eisenhower, the U.S. Secretary of State, the British Foreign Secretary, and the French Foreign Minister in the United States. The reporter linked Adenauer's visit to the recent Soviet government note, pointing out that Adenauer "should consult with the three major Western powers" before responding to the Soviet note. The reporter wrote: "The date of talks with the Russians will be one of the many questions Adenauer will consult the Western countries on."

The news specifically mentioned that the Soviet note's proposal to establish normal relations between the two countries has caused stronger fluctuations in West German public opinion than any event in postwar German history.

    阿登纳去美国活动
    新华社十三日讯　据塔斯社伦敦十三日讯：伦敦电台消息，西德总理阿登纳已经在十二日晚上从波恩乘飞机飞往美国。
    据美联社记者发自波恩的消息说，阿登纳在美国将同艾森豪威尔总统、美国国务卿、英国外交大臣和法国外交部长会见。记者把阿登纳这次访问同苏联政府最近的照会联系起来，并且指出，阿登纳在回答苏联照会以前“应当同西方三大国进行商议。”记者写道：“同俄国人会谈的日期，将是阿登纳向西方国家请教的许多问题之一。”
    这一条消息特别提到，苏联照会中提出的关于建立两国正常关系的建议，在西德舆论界引起了比战后德国历史中任何事件更加强烈的波动。
