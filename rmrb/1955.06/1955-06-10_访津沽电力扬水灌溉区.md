In late May, the reporters visited the well-known electric-powered irrigation area in the Tianjin-Bohai Bay region of eastern Hebei Province. This area, close to the Bohai Sea coast, extends eastward from Zhangguizhuang in the suburbs of Tianjin to Lutai Town in Hebei Province, covering an area of three thousand square li. In the past, most of this area was barren saline-alkali wasteland. Now, with the help of the state, dozens of newly built and restored electric-powered pumping stations have formed a large irrigation network, helping farmers open up many paddy fields, enabling the annual growth of high-quality rice like the famous Tianjin Xiaozhan rice.

Standing on a high drainage embankment along the Jiyun River and looking out over the vast fields, we saw two electric-powered pumping stations near Lutai Town, each using a large canal more than two zhang wide and ten li long to continuously pump river water into more than 20,000 mu of paddy fields.

We visited the First Electric-Powered Pumping Station, which is managed by the Lutai Cooperative Farm. This station was newly built in 1950. In the station's small brick house are installed five electric motors totaling 750 horsepower and five large water pumps with diameters of 700 to 900 centimeters. Li Quanshan, the deputy director of the cooperative farm, told us that before the station was built, farmers here used human pushing or horse-drawn methods to water the fields, which was not only costly and yielded low output, but also took a great deal of effort, allowing them to cultivate less than 5,000 mu of paddy fields a year. Since the construction of the First Electric-Powered Pumping Station and six other stations nearby, the cost of leaching alkali and reclaiming wasteland has been reduced due to the use of electricity, and the irrigation is sufficient and timely. The yield per mu of paddy field has also increased by nearly one-fold compared to the past. Now, the paddy fields here have rapidly increased to 50,000 mu.

When we visited some of the villages here, we found many villages that had transformed from poverty to wealth. Dachenzhuang in Ninghe County is one of them. Before liberation, this village only had 400 mu of paddy fields, with a yield of only 305 jin per mu. After using electric-powered irrigation, the village's paddy fields quickly increased by more than four times, and the average yield per mu also increased by 1.4 times compared to the past. Last year, the village achieved its third bumper harvest, with a total rice output of more than 900,000 jin, more than seven times the amount when manual irrigation was used. Yang Zhenru, a model agricultural laborer, created a high-yield record of an average of 1,620 jin per mu in more than seven mu of paddy fields in the second year of using electric-powered irrigation.

Electric-powered irrigation not only helped farmers in the Tianjin-Bohai Bay area develop production, but also greatly promoted the organization of farmers here. Now, 60 to 70 percent of the farmers in the electric-powered irrigation area have been organized, and cooperative villages such as Dongzhuangzi, Dachenzhuang, Renqianhu, Xinyicun, and Xiaobeijiangu in Ninghe County have emerged. The director of the Dongzhuangzi Agricultural Production Cooperative told us that their cooperative has 70 member households. After the autumn harvest distribution last year, all members, in addition to completing the investment amount according to the cooperative's charter, voluntarily invested more than 16,000 yuan in the cooperative this year. Dong Chaojun, a middle peasant member, used to want to withdraw from the cooperative because he had a lot of land and strong labor. Later, he actually experienced the benefits of electric-powered irrigation and organization. In the past two years, his family harvested more than 10,000 jin of grain more than before. This year, he voluntarily invested in the cooperative and said that he would never think about withdrawing again. The Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative is tapping potential in various aspects such as intensive planting of paddy fields, land preparation, and wasteland reclamation, and plans to increase grain production by another 185,000 jin this year compared to last year.

Recently, the Tianjin Municipal Water Conservancy Bureau is surveying water resources in the rural areas along the Jianhe River, planning to build more electric-powered pumping stations in the future to help farmers irrigate paddy fields, so that the rural areas around the Tianjin-Bohai Bay area can be transformed into a high-yield area with more electric-powered irrigation.

    访津沽电力扬水灌溉区
    新华社记者　邓立　毛逵仁
    五月末，记者访问了河北省东部津沽地区有名的电力扬水灌溉区。这个地区紧靠渤海岸，从天津市郊区的张贵庄起，向东延伸到河北省的芦台镇止，面积达三千平方里。过去这里大部分是寸草不生的盐碱荒地。现在这里在国家帮助下新建和恢复起来的几十处电力扬水站，形成一个大的灌溉网，帮助农民开辟出了许多稻田，使这里每年生长出了像著名的天津小站稻米一样的高级稻米。
    站在蓟运河畔一处排水高堤上向辽阔的田野眺望，看到芦台镇附近的两座电力扬水站，正各自通过一条两丈多宽、十里多长的大干渠，把河水源源扬送到两万多亩的稻田里。
    我们访问了由芦台合作农场负责管理的第一电力扬水站，这个站是一九五○年新建成的。在这个站的小砖房里安装有五台共七百五十匹马力的电动机和五个七百至九百公分口径的大型水泵。合作农场副场长李全山告诉我们，在没有建这座站时，当时这里农民用人推或马拉来浇水，不但成本高产量低，而且费尽了九牛二虎之力，一年才耕种得上不到五千亩稻田。自从这座第一电力扬水站和附近其它六个站修建成后，因为用电力洗碱开荒成本降低，浇水充分及时，每亩稻田的产量又比过去增加了将近一倍。现在，这里的稻田已迅速增加到五万亩。
    当我们走访了这里的一些村庄的时候，我们发现了这里有许多由穷变富的村子。宁河县大陈庄就是其中的一个。解放前这个村子只有稻田四
  百亩，每亩产量只有三百零五斤，使用电力浇水后，这个村子稻田很快增加了四倍多，每亩产量也平均比过去增加了一点四倍。去年这个村子获得第三次丰收，产稻总额达九十多万斤，比用人工浇水时增加七倍多。农业劳动模范扬振儒曾在使用电力扬水浇地的第二年在七亩多稻田内创造了每亩平均产一千六百二十斤的高产纪录。
      电力扬水灌溉不仅帮助津沽地区农民发展了生产，还大大促进这里农民组织起来。现在在电力扬水灌溉区内已有百分之六、七十的农民组织起来，并且出现了像宁河县的董庄子、大陈庄、任千户、新一村和小北涧沽等合作化了的村庄。董庄子农业生产合作社主任告诉我们，他们社有七十户社员，去年秋收分红后，全体社员除按社章完成了投资额以外，今年还自动向社投资了一万六千多元。中农社员董朝俊家，过去因地多劳力强，入社后还曾想要出社，后来他实际体验到电力扬水和组织起来的好处，前年和去年他家比过去多收了上万斤粮食，今年他自动向社投资，还说他再也不盘算出社了。大陈庄农业生产合作社正从稻田密植、整地、开荒等各个方面挖掘潜力，计划今年要比去年再增产十八万五千斤粮食。
    最近，天津市水利局正在沿减河一带农村勘测水力，计划将来再建立一些电力扬水站帮助农民浇稻田，以便津沽一带农村能变成有更多的电力灌溉的丰产区。
