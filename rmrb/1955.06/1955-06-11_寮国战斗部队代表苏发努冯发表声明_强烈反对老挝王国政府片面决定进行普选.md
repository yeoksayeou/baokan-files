Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th: Lao news: Prince Souphanouvong issued a statement on the 6th, in the name of the representative of the Lao Fighting Units, strongly opposing the Royal Lao Government's unilateral decision to hold general elections, excluding the Lao Fighting Units.

Souphanouvong condemned the Royal Government for interrupting the political meetings six times, conducting military infiltration and attacks on the Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces, where the Lao Fighting Units were concentrated, and at the same time unilaterally preparing for general elections without the participation of the Lao Fighting Units. The Royal Government has unilaterally assigned Sam Neua Province to the electoral district of Xieng Khouang Province, which belongs to the Royal Government, and has notified the areas it controls to compile voter lists in order to hold general elections on August 28.

Souphanouvong pointed out that the Royal Government's actions, which ignore the Lao Fighting Units—a patriotic force that resisted imperialist aggressors and had liberated half of Laos' territory and nearly half of its population before the ceasefire—aim to eliminate the Lao Fighting Units in order to turn Laos into a colony and military base of the United States.

Souphanouvong also pointed out that these actions clearly violate the wishes and interests of the entire Lao people and infringe upon the civil rights of the Lao people. These actions not only seriously violate the Geneva Accords but also seriously threaten the peace and unity of Laos.

Souphanouvong finally demanded that the Royal Government postpone the unilaterally stipulated general election and resume the interrupted political meetings to discuss the regulations for the general election. Such regulations should enable all Lao citizens, including all those who participated in the war of resistance and those who did not participate in the war of resistance, to enjoy the rights to elect, be elected, and campaign.

    寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯发表声明
    强烈反对老挝王国政府片面决定进行普选
    新华社河内十日电　老挝消息：苏发努冯亲王在六日发表声明，以寮国战斗部队代表的名义强烈反对老挝王国政府排斥寮国战斗部队片面决定进行普选。
    苏发努冯谴责王国政府六次中断政治会议，对寮国战斗部队集结的桑怒省和丰沙里省进行军事渗入和进攻，同时又在没有寮国战斗部队参加的情况下片面准备普选。王国政府已擅自把桑怒省划归属于王国政府的川圹省的选区，并且通知它所控制的各个地区编制选民名单，以便在八月二十八日进行普选。
    苏发努冯指出，王国政府这种无视寮国战斗部队——一支爱国的反抗帝国主义侵略者的、并且在停战前已经解放了老挝的一半土地和近一半人口的力量——的行为，其目的是企图消灭寮国战斗部队，以便把老挝变为美国的殖民地和军事基地。
    苏发努冯还指出，这些行为明显地违背老挝全体人民的愿望和利益，侵犯了老挝人民的公民权利。这些行为不但严重违反日内瓦协定，而且还严重威胁老挝的和平和统一。
    苏发努冯最后要求王国政府延缓举行它片面规定的普选；并且恢复中断的政治会议，来讨论普选的法规。这种法规应当能使一切老挝公民，包括所有以前参加抗战的人和没有参加抗战的人，都能享有选举、被选举和竞选权利。
