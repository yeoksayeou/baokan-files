The hemorrhoid fistula medical team from Chongqing, transferred to Beijing by the Ministry of Health, has achieved good results in spreading the experience of traditional Chinese medicine treatment of hemorrhoids and fistulas in Beijing for more than half a year; and has created a good example in the cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, Western doctors learning from Chinese medicine, and sorting out the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine.

The Chongqing hemorrhoid fistula medical team is composed of traditional Chinese medicine doctors Jiang Houfu, Zhou Jimin, and Western medicine doctors Li Kaitai and Chen Zhihan. In October 1952, the Surgical Society of the Chongqing Branch of the Chinese Medical Association and the Chongqing Chinese Medicine Association jointly discussed the treatment methods for hemorrhoids and fistulas. At that time, traditional Chinese medicine doctors Jiang Houfu, Zhou Jimin, and Zhang Ronghui provided an effective method of using dry hemorrhoid powder to treat hemorrhoids and using the thread-hanging method to treat fistulas, which had never been externally transmitted by traditional Chinese medicine in the past. Later, they and the surgeons Li Kaitai and Chen Zhihan from the Chongqing Seventh People's Hospital jointly used this traditional Chinese medicine treatment method to treat hemorrhoid fistula diseases, and achieved remarkable results. After this medical team was transferred to Beijing in September 1954, they established a hemorrhoid fistula department in the Sixth Hospital directly under the Ministry of Health, using the traditional Chinese medicine dry hemorrhoid therapy and thread-hanging method to treat patients with internal hemorrhoids and anorectal fistulas respectively. So far, more than 800 people have been cured. For example, Zhang Yannong, who had suffered from internal hemorrhoids for more than ten years, and Zhang Weiting and Zhou Juzheng, who had suffered from anorectal fistulas for more than twenty years, have recently been cured by this medical team.

Beijing hospitals have successively selected a group of surgeons to participate in this medical team for clinical study. Many surgeons have learned this traditional Chinese medicine treatment method for hemorrhoids and fistulas, and have begun clinical treatment in their respective hospitals. In the process of learning, these surgeons personally experienced many advantages of traditional Chinese medicine treatment methods for hemorrhoids and fistulas. Wu Jingbo, a surgeon from the Sixth Hospital directly under the Central Government who participated in the study, said: Traditional Chinese medicine's hemorrhoid fistula therapy does have many advantages over Western medicine. It can not only reduce the patient's pain during medical treatment, but also shorten the medical process. Some operations that Western medicine cannot do can be treated with this traditional Chinese medicine therapy. This treatment method is effective, the equipment is simple, and it is a traditional Chinese medicine medical experience that is very worthy of research, learning, and promotion.

Now, this medical team is preparing to summarize their rich clinical experience during this stage in Beijing, in order to better carry out the work of sorting out the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine.

    重庆痔瘘医疗组在京传播治疗经验有成绩
    由卫生部从重庆调来北京工作的痔瘘医疗小组，半年多来在北京传播中医治疗痔瘘的经验，成绩很好；并在中西医合作、西医学中医、整理祖国医学遗产方面创造了良好的范例。
    重庆痔瘘医疗小组是由中医师蒋厚甫、周济民和西医师李开泰、陈之寒四人组成的。一九五二年十月，中华医学会重庆分会外科学会和重庆中医学会，共同研究讨论痔瘘的治疗方法，当时中医师蒋厚甫、周济民、张荣辉提供了过去中医从未外传的一种用枯痔散治疗痔疮；用挂线法治疗瘘管的有效方法。以后，他们同重庆市第七人民医院的外科医师李开泰、陈之寒共同用中医的这种治疗方法治疗痔瘘病症，取得了显著成效。一九五四年九月这个医疗小组调来北京后，便在卫生部中央直属机关第六医院成立了痔瘘科，用中医的枯痔疗法和挂线法分别治疗内痔和肛直肠瘘管的病人，到目前止，已治愈了八百多个人。如患内痔十几年的张砚农，患肛直肠瘘管二十多年的张巍庭、周居正，最近都经这个医疗小组治疗好了。
    北京各医院并先后选派了一批外科大夫参加这个医疗小组进行临床学习。许多外科医师已经学会了这一中医治疗痔瘘的方法，并开始在自己所在的医院中进行临床治疗。这些外科医师在学习过程中，亲身体会到中医治疗痔瘘方法的许多优点。参加学习的中央直属机关第六医院的外科大夫吴静波说：中医的痔瘘疗法的确有许多地方优于西医，它不但可以减轻病人医疗中的痛苦；而且又缩短了医疗过程，在西医有些不能做的手术，但用中医这种疗法就可治疗。这种治疗方法有效，设备又简单，是十分值得研究学习和推广的一种中医医疗的经验。
    现在，这个医疗小组正准备总结他们在北京期间这一阶段的丰富临床经验，以更好地来进行整理祖国医学遗产的工作。
