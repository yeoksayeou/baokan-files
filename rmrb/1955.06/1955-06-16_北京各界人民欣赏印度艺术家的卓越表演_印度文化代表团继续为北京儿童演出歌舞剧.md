Xinhua News Agency, 15th. On the evening of the 15th, more than 3,800 people enjoyed the flowers of Indian folk art—the artistic performance of the Indian Cultural Delegation—at an open-air theater in the Beijing Working People’s Cultural Palace.

The people of Beijing consider it fortunate to be able to see the performances of Indian artists. On the 14th, after the news that the Indian Cultural Delegation would perform at the Labor Theater spread, people from factories, schools, government offices, military units, streets, and suburbs rushed to the Working People's Cultural Palace to queue up for tickets. The line for tickets stretched from the Labor Theater all the way across the central gate of Tiananmen Square. Although ticket sales were scheduled to begin at 12:00 noon, people were already waiting there as early as 7:30 in the morning. All the tickets were sold out in less than two hours, however, many people still requested tickets, and they had to return empty-handed.

The spacious open-air theater was packed to capacity. People arrived at the theater in succession one hour before the performance began.

The stage curtain slowly rose amidst the audience's long applause. The venue immediately quieted down, and many people raised their binoculars to carefully appreciate the moving performances of the Indian artists. The ten musical and dance programs performed at the evening party were universally loved by the audience.

The Handkerchief Dance performed by members of the Little Ballet Troupe, which is very similar to the Xiaoyangge Dance of northern China, was once again well received tonight. After this program ended, the announcer went to the front of the stage twice to prepare to announce the next program, but was stopped by the audience's warm applause. After the performers took curtain calls again and again, the applause in the venue still did not subside, and finally another performance was given.

A. H. J. Kanhn, the sitar player, once again won the audience's appreciation tonight with his extraordinary musical talent. At the beginning, Kanhn brought the audience into a beautiful musical realm with light and pleasant melodies. As the musical melodies gradually intensified, the audience's interest grew even stronger, and people could not help but burst into a short burst of applause for this perfect artistic performance. While Kanhn was playing fascinatingly, the famous Chinese painter Ye Qianyu captured his moving image of playing the qin on the screen.

The Naga dance performed by five artists including Su Devi is a folk dance of the Kabui Naga tribe in Manipur, northeastern India, and is performed once every winter. The performers' meticulous movements left a very deep impression on the audience.

The evening ended after the Ramayana dance performance. More than 60 representatives of the capital's audience went on stage to present flowers to the Indian artists to express their gratitude. At this time, the entire audience stood up and applauded thunderously.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The artists of the Little Ballet Troupe of the Indian Cultural Delegation, today performed a song and dance drama for the children of Beijing that integrates ballet, songs and drama: "The Art of Wise Living."

In today's performance, the Indian artists brilliantly created the images of many kind and lovely creatures, including a clever and sophisticated crow, a steady and intelligent tortoise, a nimble mouse, and a beautiful deer. The children watched the performance with smiles, and occasionally gave low praise. After each performance, the children applauded enthusiastically. After the Indian artists finished their performances, they took curtain calls again and again amidst ten minutes of applause. Mr. Karta, the performer of the Crow, held up a five-year-old child who presented him with flowers; the children who went on stage to present flowers all held the flowers returned by the Indian artists and cheered and applauded on stage.

    北京各界人民欣赏印度艺术家的卓越表演
    印度文化代表团继续为北京儿童演出歌舞剧
    新华社十五日讯　十五日晚上，有三千八百多人在北京劳动人民文化宫的一座露天剧场里，欣赏了印度人民艺术的花朵——印度文化代表团的艺术表演。
    北京人民把能看到印度艺术家们的表演看作是一件幸运的事情。十四日，当印度文化代表团要在劳动剧场演出的消息传出后，人们就从工厂、学校、机关、部队、街道、郊区赶到劳动人民文化宫列队购票。购票的队伍从劳动剧场一直伸延过天安门的中门。尽管售票的时间是在上午十二点开始，但人们早在清晨七时半就在那里等候。全部票子在不到两小时的时间内就全部售完，然而，还有很多人要求买票，他们只好空手而归。
    宽大的露天剧场里，座无虚席。人们在演出开始前一小时，就陆续到达剧场。
    舞台的帷幕在观众长时间的掌声中徐徐拉开了。会场顿时安静下来，许多人张起了望远镜在仔细地欣赏着印度艺术家们的动人表演，晚会上演出的十个音乐舞蹈节目普遍受到观众的热爱。
    小巴蕾舞剧团团员演出的手帕舞，和中国北方的小秧歌舞很相似，今晚又一次受到了好评。这个节目表演结束后，报幕人曾两次走到台前准备报告下一个节目，都被观众的热烈掌声所阻止。表演者再三谢幕后，会场的掌声仍然没有平息，最后作了再一次表演。
    锡达尔的演奏者阿·哈·贾·康恩，今晚又以他那超人的音乐才能获得了观众的赞赏。一开始，康恩就以轻微动听的旋律把观众带进优美的音乐境界，随着音乐旋律的逐渐强烈，观众的兴趣也越加浓厚，人们为这种完美的艺术表演而情不自抑地暴发出一阵短促的掌声。当康恩正演奏得引人入胜的当儿，中国著名画家叶浅予将他扶琴演奏的动人形象留在画面里。
    由苏·德维等五名艺术家表演的那加族舞，是印度东北曼尼普尔邦的卡布伊·那加族的民间舞，每年冬季里表演一次。表演者的细致动作给观众留下了极深的印象。
    晚会在罗摩衍舞表演后宣告结束，首都观众代表六十多人登台，向印度艺术家们献花表示感谢。这时，全场起立，掌声雷动。
    新华社十五日讯　印度文化代表团小巴蕾舞剧团的艺术家们，今天为北京的儿童演出了一个把巴蕾舞、歌曲和戏剧溶合为一的歌舞剧：“智慧生活的艺术”。
    印度艺术家在今天的演出中，出色地创造了许多亲切可爱的生物的形象，其中有机灵老练的乌鸦，有稳重聪明的乌龟，有灵活的老鼠和美丽的小鹿。孩子们带着微笑在观看表演，并不时发出低低的赞美声。每场表演后，孩子们都热烈地鼓掌，印度艺术家们表演结束后在长达十分钟的掌声中再三谢幕。乌鸦的表演者卡尔塔先生高举起一个向他献花的五岁儿童；上台献花的孩子们，都拿着印度艺术家回赠的花朵在台上鼓掌欢呼。
