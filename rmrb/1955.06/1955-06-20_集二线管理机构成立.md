    The management organization for the Ji-Er Line—the Jining Transportation Sub-bureau—was established in Jining in early June. The several hundred staff members who make up the Jining Transportation Sub-bureau have been transferred from the Taiyuan, Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, and other railway administrations and are currently concentrating in Jining.

      From July to November of this year, the Jining Transportation Sub-bureau will organize technical workers transferred from various places, including those engaged in transshipment, locomotive operation, vehicle repair, shunting, communications signals, and track maintenance, to study the broad-gauge regulations and systems, and will conduct education on international railway regulations and ethnic minority policies for all employees. Currently, 350 commercial and transshipment staff members are studying international railway operations on the Manchuria Railway line. (Xinhua News Agency)

    集二线管理机构成立
    集二线的管理机构——集宁运输分局六月上旬已经在集宁成立。组成集宁运输分局的几百名工作人员已经由太原、北京、天津、哈尔滨等铁路管理局抽调出来，目前正向集宁集中。
      今年七月到十一月，集宁运输分局将组织各地调来的换装、机车乘务、车辆检修、调车、通讯信号、养路等技术工人学习宽轨规程制度，并在全体员工中进行国际联运和民族政策的教育。现在，有三百五十多名商务和换装工作人员，正在满洲里铁路线上学习国际联运工作。　（新华社）
