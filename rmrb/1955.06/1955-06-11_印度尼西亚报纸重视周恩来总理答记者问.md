    印度尼西亚报纸重视周恩来总理答记者问
    新华社雅加达十日电　印度尼西亚报纸十日以显著地位刊登了周恩来总理答印度尼西亚记者问，并且广泛地加以评论。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”的社论说，从周恩来总理的谈话中，“我们能够理解到为什么中华人民共和国如此真挚地希望和平。”这家报纸说，周恩来在亚非会议上和其他许多场合的发言中曾提出和平建议，愿意同美国进行谈判。这一和平建议由于中华人民共和国政府方面采取了释放四个美国飞行员这种行动而得到加强。
      “东星报”发表评论说：“如果美国也要求和平的话，它就应当迅速肯定而明白地说明它愿意进行谈判，以谋求台湾紧张局势的和平解决。”
    这家报纸说，台湾地区紧张局势的解决意味着消除亚洲紧张局势，这是个同亚洲许多国家的利益有关的问题。这家报纸谈到中国对印度尼西亚斡旋建议的积极反应时说，现在又该是由美国来表示它的明确的态度了。这家报纸强调说：“现在该是美国向世界表明它的亚洲新政策，特别是有关台湾的政策的时候了。”
    “社会使者报”在社论中表示欢迎中华人民共和国释放四个美国飞行员的行动。这家报纸说，全世界的目光目前正注视着美国。
