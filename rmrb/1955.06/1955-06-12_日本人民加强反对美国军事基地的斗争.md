    Japanese People Strengthen Struggle Against American Military Bases
      Representatives from Various Regions Strongly Oppose Expansion of U.S. Air Force Bases
    Representatives from eight locations in Japan, including Niigata, Yokota, Tachikawa, Kisarazu, and Komaki, expressed strong opposition to the expansion of local U.S. Air Force bases to the House of Representatives Cabinet Committee on the 3rd.
    The representatives described the disasters caused by the presence of U.S. Air Force bases in their localities. The representative from the Yokota area pointed out that if the Yokota Air Force Base were expanded, approximately 170 acres of farmland would be seized, affecting more than 300 farmers.
      U.S. Military Target Practice on Mount Fuji in Japan Stirs Strong Opposition
    U.S. military target practice in the Mount Fuji area of Japan, which endangers the lives of local residents, has aroused strong opposition. The Yamanashi Prefecture authorities and the Fujiyoshida City authorities successively lodged protests with the U.S. military on the 6th and 8th, demanding that the U.S. military cease its target practice. The local residents' calls for the U.S. military to stop target practice are also growing louder. However, the U.S. military has so far adopted an arrogant and dismissive attitude towards these demands.
    Seiichiro Takahashi, Chairman of the Cultural Properties Protection Committee of the Japanese Ministry of Education, stated at a meeting of the House of Representatives Education Committee on May 24 that the Cultural Properties Protection Committee and the Ministry of Education submitted a letter of protest to the U.S. military authorities on the 24th, protesting against the destruction of more than 40 trees regarded as cultural relics during U.S. military target practice on Mount Fuji, and demanding that the U.S. military authorities guarantee that the same thing will not happen again in the future.
      Osaka Prefectural Assembly Agricultural Land Committee Opposes Expansion of Itami Base
    The Agricultural Land Committee of the Osaka Prefectural Assembly unanimously passed a resolution on the 3rd, opposing the U.S. military's plan to expand Itami Airport.
    Itami Airport is located between Osaka Prefecture and Hyogo Prefecture. The U.S. military plans to expand this airport to make it usable for jet bombers. If this plan is implemented, 120,000 tsubo of farmland in the three cities of Itami, Ikeda, and Toyonaka near the airport will be destroyed. Therefore, local residents have expressed strong opposition.
      Ryukyu Government Delegation Opposes U.S. Military Land Acquisition on Okinawa Island
    A spokesman for a Ryukyu Government delegation, Hiroshi Sena, said in Washington: The Ryukyu Government delegation opposes the United States' large-scale purchase of land on Okinawa Island to build military facilities. This delegation was summoned to Washington by the U.S. Army authorities to negotiate land issues. The U.S. Department of the Army is requesting Congress to allocate funds to purchase 52,000 acres of land on Okinawa Island in the 1956 fiscal year, starting in July, to build Okinawa Island into a permanent U.S. military base.
    Sena said: The people of Okinawa Island are unwilling to sell their land and oppose the long-term use by the U.S. military. He estimates that the U.S. military has now "leased" 40,000 acres of land on Okinawa Island at low rents, of which about 16,000 acres are farmland, accounting for 20 percent of all farmland on the island. The Okinawan legislature has passed resolutions twice opposing the United States' further increase in the amount of land used for military purposes.
    Sena estimates that the land the U.S. military intends to acquire belongs to 50,000 households, with an average of five people per household.
      U.S. Military Forced to Abandon Plan to Expand Itazuke Air Force Base
    According to Kyodo News, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force in Japan said that the U.S. Far East Armed Forces Command has decided to abandon the plan to expand the U.S. Itazuke Air Force Base in Fukuoka Prefecture.
    This is a direct result of the protest movement against the expansion of U.S. military bases launched nationwide in Japan. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) (Attached picture)

    日本人民加强反对美国军事基地的斗争
      各地代表强烈反对扩充美国空军基地
    日本新潟、横田、立川、木更津和小牧等八个地方的代表，三日向众议院内阁委员会表示强烈反对扩充当地的美国空军基地。
    代表们陈述了美国空军基地的存在对当地造成的灾害。横田地区的代表指出，如果横田空军基地扩充的话，将有一百七十英亩左右的耕地被侵占，影响三百多个农民。
      美军在日本富士山打靶激起强烈反对
    美军在日本富士山区进行伤害当地居民生命的打靶，激起强烈的反对。山梨县当局和富士吉田市当局先后在六日和八日向美军提出抗议，要求美军停止打靶。当地居民要求美军停止打靶的呼声也越来越高。但是，美军对这些要求至今采取着蛮横不理的态度。
    日本文部省的文化财保护委员会主席高桥诚一郎五月二十四日在众议院文部委员会会议上说，文化财保护委员会和文部省二十四日向美军当局提出了抗议书，抗议美军在富士山打靶时摧毁了四十多棵被当作文物的树木，并要求美军当局保证以后不再发生同样的事情。
      大阪府议会农地委员会反对扩大伊丹基地
    日本大阪府议会的农地委员会在三日一致通过决议，反对美军扩大伊丹飞机场的计划。
    伊丹飞机场位于大阪府和兵库县之间，美军准备扩大这个机场使它能供喷气式轰炸机使用。这个计划如果实行，机场附近的伊丹、池田、丰中三个市的十二万坪耕地就将破坏。因此，当地居民曾表示强烈反对。
      琉球政府代表团反对美军征购冲绳岛土地
    一个琉球政府代表团的发言人濑永广在华盛顿说：琉球政府代表团反对美国为建立军事设施大量购买冲绳岛的土地。这个代表团是被美国陆军当局召到华盛顿去谈判土地问题的。美国陆军部正在要求国会拨款，以便在从七月开始的一九五六会计年度内，在冲绳岛购买五万二千英亩的土地，把冲绳岛建立为美国的永久军事基地。
    濑永广说：冲绳岛人民不愿意出卖他们的土地，也反对美军长期使用。他估计，美军现在在冲绳岛已经用低微的租金“租用”了四万英亩土地，其中约一万六千英亩是耕地，占岛上全部耕地的百分之二十。冲绳岛的立法机关曾两次通过决议，反对美国再增加用于军事目的的土地的数量。
    濑永广估计，美军准备征购的土地属于五万户人家所有，普通一户有五口人。
      美军被迫放弃扩大板付空军基地计划
    据共同社报道，美国驻日空军发言人说，美国远东武装部队司令部决定放弃在福冈县扩大美国板付空军基地的计划。
    这是日本全国范围内展开反对扩大美军基地的抗议运动的直接后果。（据新华社讯）（附图片）
    五月三十日，日本立川市附近砂川镇居民的代表到东京都政府请愿，反对美军扩大在立川的空军基地。　新华社稿
