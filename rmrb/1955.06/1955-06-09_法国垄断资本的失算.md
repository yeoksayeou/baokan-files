    After the Paris Accords began to be implemented, the harm this military agreement caused to France became increasingly obvious. West German militarists are stepping up the reconstruction of their military forces, and the sound of Wehrmacht boots will soon be heard again on the French border. In order to participate in the arms race, France's military budget for this year has increased to an astronomical figure of one trillion francs. The Franco-Soviet Treaty, which was a reliable guarantee of France's security, has been cancelled. Under the increasing threat of war, France is in an extremely unfavorable situation.

    The French ruling group originally intended to sell out national interests in order to seek benefits for themselves in the collusion of rearming West Germany. But now it is becoming increasingly clear that this is just their subjective wishful thinking, and it will ultimately be in vain.

    French monopoly capital has never shied away from wanting West Germany to recognize their economic interests in the Saar as the price for France's agreement to rearm West Germany. However, when the Bonn Group saw that the Paris Accords were about to be obtained, they began to unilaterally interpret the Franco-German Saar Agreement, thus causing disputes between France and West Germany. In order to reconcile the differences between the two sides in this regard, Pinay rushed to Bonn to meet with Adenauer on the eve of France's deposit of the ratification instrument of the Paris Accords. The communique issued on April 30 showed that French monopoly capital was forced to make significant concessions on the Saar issue. The French arms monopoly capital Schneider Group originally planned to acquire the Völklingen steel plant in the Saar, which produced 850,000 tons of steel, at a low price, but ended up only splitting the equity with the original owner, the Röchling family, changing from French military control to Franco-German joint venture. As for the Moselle Canal dredging plan that the French steel trust had been looking forward to day and night, it disappeared without a trace. Therefore, the weekly "French Observer" on May 5 accused Pinay of "losing the Saar." Another French bourgeois newspaper, "Fact News," also complained: "When France deposited the ratification instrument of the Paris Accords, it played its last trump card without getting much benefit."

    After the war, West Germany's economic potential has rapidly recovered with the support of the United States and has become a serious competitive force in the capitalist world market. In terms of exports, West Germany has far surpassed France and jumped to third place in the capitalist world. One of the wishful thinking of French and British monopoly capital is to weaken West Germany's competitive power in the international market by rearming West Germany. But facts will show that this approach will only lead to the opposite result. In order to support huge military production and pay for the huge cost of rearmament, West Germany will inevitably step up its search for military raw materials and funds abroad, and therefore cannot but participate more fiercely in the struggle for raw materials and markets. West German Economics Minister Erhard also publicly stated that the Paris Accords have a beneficial rather than a detrimental effect on West German industrial products entering the capitalist world market. In particular, historical experience has long proven that once West German monopoly capital is armed, they will use force to deal with their competitors. The French bourgeois "Echo" is concerned that rearmament will make "West Germany's economy more harmful in the international market." This is not without foresight.

    Of course, what interests French monopoly capital is also the war profits derived from the collusion of rearming West Germany; French monopoly capital is eager for the prospect of military orders from West Germany. However, the bankruptcy of the "common arms pool" plan vigorously advocated by Mendès-France has shown that the United States and its West German partners do not want France to share the military profits of rearming West Germany. In the early stages of West Germany's rearmament, French monopoly capital can get some benefits. For example, since October 1954, France has had a surplus of 10 to 20 million US dollars per month on the balance sheet of the Western European Payments Union for several consecutive months, mainly due to the large export of steel materials and heavy industrial equipment to West Germany. For West German militarists, this is conducive to accelerating the speed of rearmament, but once the West German arms industry equipment is completed, it will no longer be a question of absorbing French heavy industrial products, but a question of West Germany using its strong industrial power to launch a new impact on the French market. The French magazine "Economy and Politics" recently pointed out that according to experts, West Germany has deep industrial potential, and even under the burden of a military budget of more than one trillion francs per year, it still has enough power to compete in international commerce. What's more, the United States has prepared billions of dollars worth of military equipment to supply West Germany for the reconstruction of the "Bundeswehr," and the United States and the Bonn Group are currently negotiating on this. How much benefit French monopoly capital can get from West German military orders is a big question.

    As for the US military orders that French monopoly capital has always relied on, they have been decreasing year by year since 1952. France has gained even less in terms of "indirect overseas orders" for supplying US troops stationed in Europe. West Germany has received far more indirect overseas orders than France before joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Now that the Paris Accords have begun to be implemented, West Germany has joined the North Atlantic Treaty Group, and the arms coordination mechanism plan has been buried, a large number of overseas order forms will inevitably be transferred to West German enterprises. On the contrary, France's prospects for overseas orders are very bleak. The French magazine "International Forum" recently pointed out:
    "The huge flow of direct overseas orders will increasingly leave France and flow elsewhere." According to "International Forum," by the end of this year, enterprises that have become prosperous by relying on US overseas orders will encounter a very serious crisis, and the "expansion without inflation, permanent economic prosperity" slogans put forward by the French ruling group will become empty fantasies at that time." This is not without basis.

    From the above aspects, it can be concluded that the French ruling group's policy of following the United States to revive West German militarism not only seriously damages France's national interests, but also does not bring much benefit to itself. On the contrary, it is full of dangers. Even within various bourgeois political parties in France, more and more people have seen this clearly. Therefore, the movement in France against the government's policy of following the United States to rearm West Germany has developed unprecedentedly, and the domestic political situation in France has become even more unstable. One hundred and thirty-seven prominent public leaders and politicians in France recently wrote to French Prime Minister Faure, expressing their regret and dissatisfaction with the government's hasty deposit of the ratification instrument of the Paris Accords, and demanded that four-power talks be held before West Germany is rearmed. This cannot but reflect the wishes and will of the broad masses of the French people, who demand that France take a path of peace and independence. Recent developments in the international situation have shown the French people more clearly that such a path exists.

    法国垄断资本的失算
    凌其翰
    巴黎协定开始实施以后，这一个军事协定对于法国的危害就愈加明显了。西德的军国主义者正在加紧重建他们的军事力量，在法国的边境又要听到国防军皮靴的响声。为了参加军备竞赛，法国本年度的军事预算增加到一万亿法郎的天文数字。作为法国安全的可靠保证的法苏条约已被勾销。在日益增加的战争威胁下，法国处于极其不利的境地。
    法国的统治集团原是企图出卖民族利益来在重新武装西德的勾当中谋求他们本身的好处的。但是现在事情愈来愈清楚地证明，这不过是他们主观的如意算盘，到头来将是一场空。
    法国的垄断资本从来就不讳言他们要以西德承认他们在萨尔的经济利益，作为法国同意重新武装西德的代价。但是波恩集团在看到巴黎协定即将到手的时候，就已经开始对法国和西德的萨尔协定进行片面的解释，因而引起了法国与西德之间的纠纷。为了调和双方在这方面的分歧，比内曾在法国交存巴黎协定批准书的前夕，赶到波恩与阿登纳会谈。四月三十日发表的会谈公报表明，法国垄断资本在萨尔问题上被迫作了很大的让步。法国军火垄断资本许奈特集团原来打算以贱价收购萨尔的产钢八十五万吨的沃尔克林根炼钢厂，结果只做到和原业主洛希林家族平分股权，从原由法国军事管制改变为法德合营。至于法国钢铁托辣斯日夜期待实现的疏浚摩塞尔运河计划则烟消云散，无影无踪了。因此，五月五日“法兰西观察家”周刊责备比内“丧失了萨尔”。另外一家法国资产阶级的报纸“事实报”也抱怨说：“法国在交存巴黎协定的批准书时，它没有得到多大的好处就打出了最后一张王牌。”
    战后西德的经济潜力在美国的扶植下已迅速恢复，成为资本主义世界市场中的一个严重的竞争力量。在输出方面，西德已远远超过了法国而跃居资本主义世界的第三位。法国和英国的垄断资本的如意算盘之一是想用使西德重整军备的办法来削弱西德在国际市场上的竞争力量。但是事实将表明，这种做法只会造成相反的结果。西德为了支持庞大的军事生产和支付重新武装的巨大费用，必然要加紧向国外找寻军事原料和资金，因而不能不更猛烈地参加争夺原料和市场的斗争。西德的经济部长艾哈德也公开说过，巴黎协定对于西德工业品进入资本主义世界市场是起着有利的而不是不利的影响。特别是，历史经验早已证明，西德的垄断资本一旦有了武装，它们就会用武力来对付它们的竞争者。法国资产阶级的“回声报”耽心重新武装将使“西德的经济在国际市场上更具危害性”。这不是没有远见的。
    当然，使法国垄断资本感兴趣的还有从重新武装西德的勾当中分得战争的利润；法国垄断资本对于来自西德的军事订货的前景，是心向往之的。但是孟戴斯—弗朗斯曾经竭力鼓吹的“军备共储”计划的破产，已经表明美国和它的西德伙伴并不想让法国来分沾重新武装西德的军火利润。在西德重整军备的初期，法国的垄断资本是可以得到一些好处的。例如，自从一九五四年十月起，法国在西欧支付同盟的平衡表上接连几个月每月都有盈余一二千万美元，这主要是钢铁材料和重工业器材向西德大量输出的结果。在西德军国主义者来说，这有利于加速重新武装的速度，但一俟西德军火工业装备完成，那时候就不再是吸收法国的重工业产品，而将是西德挟其雄厚的工业力量来对法国市场进行新的冲击的问题了。法国“经济与政治”杂志最近指出，据专家估计，西德工业潜力深厚，即使在负担每年军事预算一万亿法郎以上的情况下，还有足够的力量来进行国际商业上的竞争。何况美国已经准备好了数十亿美元的军事装备来供应西德重建“国防军”之用，美国和波恩集团并为此正在进行谈判。法国垄断资本能够从西德军事订货上取得多大油水是大成问题的。
    至于法国垄断资本所一向依靠的美国的军事订货，自一九五二年以来，就在逐年减少。在供应驻欧美军的“间接海外订货”方面，法国获得的好处更少。西德在没有参加北大西洋公约组织以前获得的间接海外订货已远超出法国。现在巴黎协定开始实施，西德参加了北大西洋公约集团，而军备统筹机构计划已被埋葬掉，大批海外订货单势将转入西德企业之手，相反地，法国指望海外订货的前景则非常暗淡。法国的“国际论坛”杂志最近曾指出：
  “直接海外订货的巨流将愈益离开法国而流往别处。”据“国际论坛”估计，到今年年底，曾经靠美国海外订货而利市起来的企业将遭遇十分严重的危机，而法国统治集团所提出的“扩建而不致通货膨胀，经济永远繁荣这些口号到那时将成为空洞的奇谈。”这并不是没有根据的。
    从上面这些方面来看，就可以得出结论，法国统治集团追随美国复活西德军国主义的政策，不仅是严重地损害法国的民族利益，而且也并不能给它自己带来多少好处，相反，倒是充满着危险。就是在法国各个资产阶级政党内部，也有愈来愈多的人看清楚了这一点。因此，现在法国国内反对政府追随美国重新武装西德的政策的运动已发展得空前广泛，法国国内政治局势已经更加不稳定。法国一百三十七位著名的公众领袖和政界人士最近写信给法国总理富尔，对政府匆匆忙忙交存了巴黎协定的批准书表示遗憾和不满，要求在西德重新武装以前举行四国会谈。这不能不是反映了法国广大阶层人民的愿望和意志，他们要求法国走和平独立的道路。最近国际局势的发展向法国人更清楚地显示，这样的道路是存在的。
