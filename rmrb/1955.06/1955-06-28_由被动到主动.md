From Passive to Active
Zhang Jianfeng, Deputy Director of the Planning Department of the Ministry of Construction Engineering

For several years, the vast majority of construction enterprises under the Ministry of Construction Engineering have consistently failed to carry out construction actively, according to plan, and in a step-by-step manner. Construction tasks have mostly been completed under conditions of extreme rush and passivity, resulting in significant economic losses for the state.

One of the fundamental reasons for this situation is that construction units often fail to finalize plans, and construction projects frequently change. On the one hand, they demand that construction units speed up progress, while on the other hand, they fail to deliver design drawings on time, and overall planning and construction organization designs cannot be prepared early enough. This disrupts the construction sequence, affects pre-construction preparation work, and makes it impossible for construction enterprises to organize balanced construction. Another fundamental reason is that, in the face of these objective difficulties, the construction sector has developed two biases: some construction enterprises blindly forge ahead, concentrating labor and stockpiling materials without clarifying the task requirements. Without drawings, they lay roads, build auxiliary enterprises, and install drainage pipes and electrical wires. Other construction enterprises feel that the client's plans keep changing and will not be finalized for some time, so they adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Once the drawings arrive and the client urges them to start construction immediately, they have no choice but to rush into construction without proper preparation. These two biases manifest differently, but both violate the construction sequence. From commencement to completion, there is a lack of scientific calculation, thorough preparation, and comprehensive consideration of issues. This makes work even more passive, resulting in a progress pattern of being slack at the beginning and tight at the end, with extensive idling in the first half of the year and frantic rush work in the second half. In terms of materials, this leads to stockpiling and affects capital turnover. In terms of site layout, due to a lack of connection with specific circumstances and the guidance of a unified design concept, coordinates are often incorrect, elevations are wrong, or temporary works clash with permanent works. Some things are done wrong and need to be changed, while others are done insufficiently and need to be added. Temporary buildings are built and demolished repeatedly, neglecting one thing for another. Materials are stored in the wrong places, requiring frequent relocation.

To reverse this chaotic situation and shift the work of construction enterprises from passive to active, we organized relevant construction units, engineering companies, and design institutes to study the construction projects of three units, including the tractor manufacturing plant, making clear arrangements from the start of construction to completion.

First, based on the requirements of the state construction plan, we stipulated the overall construction progress of the entire factory—when to start construction, when to prepare for production, when to complete and put into operation, and how much work to complete each year. Specific regulations were also made for each individual project. Then, based on the completion date, we calculated when the design drawings and construction organization designs for each project must be delivered, thereby determining the design progress. Finally, we formulated a construction schedule based on the design progress—when to carry out construction preparation, when to sign contracts, when to start and complete each project, and how to coordinate installation and civil engineering. In this way, everyone had a clear understanding of the construction progress of the entire project and the responsibilities of each unit. Construction enterprises can carry out pre-construction preparation work in advance, and the preparation can be more practical. They can rationally arrange the tasks and labor force for each year and each quarter based on the order of priority of each project being put into production, so that the workload and labor input between years and quarters can be more balanced. This can fundamentally overcome the chaos, passivity, and resulting serious waste in construction.

During the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, serious losses were incurred due to the failure to develop an overall construction schedule early on. However, when we started the construction of the tractor manufacturing plant and other projects, we did not learn from the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's lessons. We overestimated the workload for 1955 and concentrated forces too early, resulting in an idling rate of over 40% at the beginning of the year, with nothing to do for a long time. Materials were transported to the site very early, covering the mountains and plains, which led to capital stockpiling and made it impossible to handle many matters due to lack of funds. Local areas, in order to support these key projects, opened many brick and tile kilns, lime kilns, and processing plants, which also had to idle along with the construction units. Fortunately, the factory buildings of these projects had not yet started construction, so the situation was not too deep. Now that an overall construction schedule has been developed, these projects have been rescued from error in a timely manner.

In addition to the overall progress, we also developed an overall plan for the construction site. These projects suffered a lot at the beginning of construction because they violated the construction sequence and acted rashly without an overall plan. For example, the roads built exceeded the design drawings by 24,200 square meters, one of which was completely scrapped because the factory's coordinates changed and clashed with the foundation of the factory building. The parking lot built not only exceeded the designed area but also exceeded the quality standards stipulated in the design. Eight hundred and forty-five meters of drainage pipes were mistakenly buried, wasting 1,900 yuan. Now that an overall plan has been developed, future errors in this regard will be avoided.

When developing the overall plan, we paid special attention to the following issues: First, we made full use of permanent works. We tried to build worker welfare buildings, processing plants, roads, and water and electricity facilities that could be used during construction as early as possible. By adopting these measures, we have already saved more than 5 million yuan in temporary works costs. Second, we carefully considered various conditions and made proper arrangements for auxiliary enterprises, especially processing plants that use a lot of materials, have a large volume of transportation, and have heavy equipment themselves, such as concrete mixing plants, steel structure plants, and precast reinforced concrete plants, to avoid relocation in the future. Third, we tried to utilize municipal construction projects, such as water sources, power sources, and roads. Unfortunately, due to the undetermined urban plan and the relatively backward municipal construction work, we have not been able to achieve anything in this regard.

During the process of developing the overall schedule this time, everyone demonstrated a good spirit of cooperation, actively overcame difficulties, and tapped potential. Construction units expressed their intention to guarantee the provision of design data to design units on schedule, design units guaranteed the delivery of drawings to construction units on schedule, and construction units guaranteed to complete the projects on schedule in accordance with the requirements of the national plan. However, because the construction work of factories is very complex, many unforeseen difficulties may still be encountered in the future. After the technical design is delivered, the overall construction schedule will still have some modifications and changes. To ensure that each link is well coordinated in accordance with the provisions of the overall schedule requires arduous efforts from all relevant units and all employees. In particular, whether the design drawings can be delivered on time has a decisive impact on whether the entire construction can be carried out according to plan, so the design units bear even greater responsibility.

After the overall construction schedule and overall plan for the tractor manufacturing plant and other units were completed, we began to carry out this work for all key projects that had submitted preliminary designs. Our experience is that as long as we study hard, learn humbly, the laws of capital construction can be mastered. The chaos, waste, and passivity in capital construction can also be completely overcome and avoided.

    由被动到主动
    建筑工程部计划司副司长　张剑锋
    几年来，建筑工程部绝大多数建筑企业总是不能主动地、有计划、有步骤地施工，工程任务大都是在十分忙乱和被动的情况下完成的，因而在经济上曾给国家造成了严重的损失。
    造成这种状况的根本原因之一，是建设单位的计划常常确定不下来，工程项目常常变动，一方面要求施工单位赶进度，一方面又不能按时交付设计图纸，总体规划和施工组织设计也不能及早编出。这样，就打乱了施工程序，影响了施工前的准备工作，使得建筑企业无法组织均衡施工。另一个根本原因，是在这种客观困难面前，建筑部门产生了两种偏向：有些建筑企业盲目冒进，没有弄清任务情况，就大量集中劳动力，大量储备材料，没有图纸，就铺设道路，兴建附属企业，敷设积水管和电线；另一些建筑企业觉得甲方的计划变来变去，反正一时定不下来，便采取了束手等待的态度，一旦图纸来到，甲方催促立即开工，便只好在没有做好施工准备的情况下，不顾一切地仓促开了工。这两种偏向的表现形式不同，但都是违背了施工程序，从开工到竣工缺乏科学的计算，缺乏充分的准备，没有全面地考虑问题。这样就使得工作更加被动。在进度上弄得前松后紧，前半年大量窝工，后半年大量抢工赶工。在材料上造成积压，影响了资金的周转。在场地布置上由于没有结合具体情况，没有统一的设计思想指导，弄得不是座标不对，就是标高错了，要不然就是暂设工程同正式工程碰了头，有的做错了要改，有的做少了又要加。临时建筑是丢东忘西，顾此失彼，盖了又拆，拆了又盖。储存材料的地方放得不对，常常要搬来搬去。
    为了扭转这种混乱的局面，使建筑企业的工作由被动转为主动，我们组织了有关的建设单位、工程公司和设计院研究了拖拉机制造厂等三个单位的建设工程，从建厂开始一直到竣工，都作了明确的安排。
    我们首先根据国家建设计划的要求，规定了整个工厂的建设进度——什么时候开工，什么时候作生产准备，什么时候竣工投入生产，每一年要完成多少工作量。每一项单位工程，也都作了具体的规定。然后，根据竣工日期，推算出各项工程的设计图纸和施工组织设计必须在什么时候交付，从而把设计进度确定下来。最后，再根据设计进度制定施工进度——什么时候进行施工准备，什么时候签订合同，各项工程什么时候开工，什么时候竣工，安装和土建如何配合等等。这样，大家对整个工程的建设进度以及各个单位应负的责任，心里都有了数。建筑企业的施工准备工作可以提前进行了，而且可以准备得切合实际，可以根据各项工程投入生产的先后、主次，比较合理地安排每一年、每一季的任务和劳动力，从而使得年度之间和季度之间的工作量和投入的劳动力都可以做到比较均衡。这样，就可以从根本上克服施工中的混乱、被动和因此产生的严重浪费。
    第一汽车制造厂在建设过程中，因为没有及早编制建厂的总进度计划，曾遭受了严重的损失。但是，我们在开始建设拖拉机制造厂等工程时，没有接受第一汽车厂的教训。把一九五五年的工作量估计得太高了，力量集中得过早，年初竟聚集了一万多人，结果窝工率高达百分之四十以上，很长时间都没有事情做。材料很早就运进了现场，满山遍野都是，因此积压了资金，使得许多要办的事没有钱办。地方上为了支援这些重点工程，开设了很多砖瓦窑、石灰窑和加工厂，也不得不随着施工单位一起窝工。幸而这几个工程的厂房还没有开工，所以陷得还不深。现在编制了建厂的总进度计划，总算把这几个工程及时从错误中挽救出来了。
    除了总进度之外，我们还编制了工程现场的总体规划。这几个工程在开始建设时因为违反了施工程序，没有总体规划就轻易行动，曾吃了很多苦头。例如，公路比设计图纸多修了二万四千二百平方公尺，其中有一条因为工厂的座标有变动而同厂房的基础发生了冲突，全部作废。修的停车厂不仅超过了设计面积，而且超过了设计规定的质量标准。积水管错埋了八百四十五公尺，浪费了一千九百元。现在编制了总体规划，就避免了以后在这方面继续发生错误。
    在编制总体规划时，我们特别注意了下面几个问题：第一，充分利用正式工程，凡是在施工中能够利用的职工福利建筑、加工厂、道路、水电，都尽量先建。由于采取这些措施，现在已经节省了五百多万元的暂设工程费用。第二，对附属企业，特别是使用材料较多，运输量较大，本身的设备又较重的加工厂，如混凝土搅拌厂、钢结构厂、钢筋混凝土预制厂等，慎重地考虑到多方面的条件，作了妥善安排，避免了以后发生搬家的现象。第三，尽量利用市政建设工程，如水源、电源、道路等。可惜，由于城市规划未定，市政建设工作也比较落后，我们在这方面还没有能够做出什么成绩。
    这次在编制总进度计划的过程中，大家都表现了很好的协作精神，积极克服困难，挖掘潜力。建设单位表示要保证按期给设计单位提供设计资料，设计单位保证按期给施工单位交付图纸，施工单位保证要按照国家计划要求准期竣工。但是，因为工厂的建设工作十分复杂，将来还可能碰到不少预料不到的困难，技术设计交付后，建厂总进度计划也还会有若干修改和变动，要做到每个环节都按照总进度的规定，配合衔接得很好，还需要一切有关单位和全体职工艰苦的努力。特别是设计图纸能否按时交付，对整个建设能否按计划进行有着决定意义，所以设计单位担负的责任更为重大。
    在拖拉机制造厂等单位的建厂总进度和总体规划编好之后，我们又对所有已提出初步设计的重点工程开始进行了这项工作。我们的体会是：只要努力钻研，虚心学习，基本建设的规律是可以掌握的。基本建设中的混乱、浪费、被动，也是完全可以克服和避免的。
