Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th -- Bonn dispatch: West German President Heuss appointed Heinrich von Brentano, Chairman of the Parliamentary Group of the West German Christian Democratic Union and a confidant of Adenauer, as Foreign Minister of the Bonn government, succeeding Adenauer. At the same time, he appointed Theodor Blank, another leader of the Christian Democratic Union and head of the West German Security Office, who has been in charge of establishing the West German army since 1950, as Minister of Defense.

It is reported that Adenauer resigned from his concurrent position as Foreign Minister in order to "devote more time to the work of building the West German army."

Prior to this, the West German government passed several military bills. One of them stipulates that the Bonn government has the right to demand that the people provide various services for the needs of the West German army, the government has the right to requisition private houses, collect supplies in kind, conduct military exercises, and conclude contracts with any factories regarding the supply of war materials. This law will be adopted once the West German government declares a state of emergency when it believes that "public safety is threatened."

    西德总统宣布两项任命
    勃伦塔诺为外长，布兰克为国防部长
    新华社柏林九日电　波恩消息：西德总统休斯七日任命西德基督教民主联盟议会党团主席、阿登纳的亲信亨里希·勃伦塔诺继阿登纳任波恩政府的外交部长，同时任命基督教民主联盟的另一个领袖、自一九五零年以来就负责主持建立西德军队事宜的西德保安处处长特奥多尔·布兰克为国防部长。
    有消息说，阿登纳所以要辞去他的外交部长兼职，是为了能“用更多的时间来进行建立西德军队的工作”。
    在这以前，西德政府通过了几个军事法案。其中有一个规定波恩政府有权为了西德军队的需要而要求人民提供各种服役、政府有权征用民房、征收实物、举行军事演习以及同任何工厂缔结关于供应战争物资的合同。这条法律将在一旦西德政府认为“公众安全受到威胁”而宣布紧急状态时即予采用。
