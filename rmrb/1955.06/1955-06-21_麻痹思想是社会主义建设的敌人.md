    Complacency is the Enemy of Socialist Construction
    Meng Tianlu
    After reading the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily," I was greatly shocked. Previously, I only thought of Hu Feng as an ambitious individualist who was against the Party, without any political background. From the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng clique, I clearly recognized that the Hu Feng clique was not simply a group of ambitious individualists; but a counter-revolutionary conspiratorial group with a political background, a long-term reactionary activity plan, and goals. From before liberation to after liberation, they echoed Chiang Kai-shek, engaging in anti-Party and anti-people activities. They hated the Chinese Communist Party and everything led by the Party. They harbored extreme hatred for the victory of the revolution led by the Party. In almost all the materials, they never failed to refer to the Party as the enemy; and they were always prepared to attack the Party and the cause led by the Party. They hated the social order after liberation, dreaming of the "demise" of our new society. They dispatched followers to infiltrate the Party, steal intelligence, and probe for information. They wore the cloak of Marxism to oppose Marxism, using the two-faced tactics of waving the banner of revolution to oppose the revolution. Could there be anything more venomous than this! Such ferocious enemies had been sleeping in the same bed with us for more than twenty years. The sudden discovery is chilling!
    At present, our socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds, and our victories in various fields are coming one after another. These great achievements are something that any enemy is unwilling to see. Therefore, they try every possible means to sabotage us. The Party has repeatedly taught us: During the transition period from the state to a socialist society, the class struggle is not alleviated but becomes more acute. The counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique also illustrate this point. We must be vigilant and always be prepared to fight against all hidden enemies. We must track down all Hu Feng elements and thoroughly eliminate them.
    From the Hu Feng incident, we can also think: Wouldn't other counter-revolutionaries similar to Hu Feng also use the method of "Sun Wukong entering the belly" to carry out sabotage? Therefore, any complacency thinking, such as "the enemy is far away from us, there are no enemies around us," or "the big enemies in our country have been defeated, there is nothing left," will bring more and greater harm to the Party and the cause of socialist construction. I urge the government to thoroughly investigate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all other counter-revolutionaries hidden within the revolutionary ranks, and to completely eliminate these vicious enemies from our revolutionary ranks to ensure our socialist construction.

    麻痹思想是社会主义建设的敌人
    孟天禄
    我看了“人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料以后，大为震惊。以前我只认为胡风是个反党的个人野心家，没有什么政治背景。从胡风集团的第三批材料中我清楚地认识到了胡风集团不单纯是个个人野心家集团；而且是一个有着政治背景、有着长远的反动活动计划和目的的反革命阴谋集团。从解放前到解放后，他们同蒋介石一直相呼相应，进行反党反人民的活动。他们憎恨中国共产党，憎恨着党所领导的一切事业。他们对党所领导的革命的胜利怀着极大的仇恨，几乎在所有的材料中没有把党不称作敌人；而且没有不准备对党和对党所领导的事业进行袭击。他们憎恨着解放以后的社会秩序，他们梦想着我们新社会的“灭亡”。他们派遣党羽，打进党来，窃取情报，探听消息。他们披着马克思主义外衣反对马克思主义，打着革命旗帜来反对革命的两面派手段，那里还有比这再毒辣的呢！如此凶恶的敌人同我们同床二十多年，骤然发现，能不叫人不寒而栗！
    目前我们的社会主义建设事业在大踏步地前进着，我们各方面的胜利接踵而来，这些伟大的成就是任何敌人都不愿意喜闻乐见的，因此他们就千方百计地来破坏。党一再教导我们：在国家向社会主义社会过渡时期，阶级斗争不是缓和了而是更加尖锐了。胡风反党集团的反革命活动也正说明了这个问题。我们必须提高警惕、时刻准备着同一切暗藏的敌人进行斗争。我们必须把胡风分子全部追查出来，加以彻底肃清。
    从胡风的事件中我们还可以想到：类似胡风的其他反革命分子难道不会和胡风一样也用“孙行者钻进肚皮”的办法来进行破坏吗？因此，任何以为“敌人离我们很远，我们周围没有什么敌人”，或者以为“我们国内的大敌人已经打倒了，没有什么了”等等麻痹思想，都会给党、给社会主义建设事业带来更多更大的损害。我要求政府彻底追究胡风反革命集团和其他一切暗藏在革命队伍内部的反革命分子，把这些穷凶极恶的敌人彻底从我们革命队伍中清除出去，来保障我们的社会主义建设事业。
