    Strive to Improve the Quality of Medicines and Medical Devices
    Jin Tongzhen
    In the past few years, China's pharmaceutical industry has made great progress. Many of the world's latest special-effect drugs and important medical devices, such as penicillin, sulfonamides, X-ray machines, short-wave electrotherapy machines, etc., which used to rely on imports before liberation, have now been successfully trial-produced and mass-produced with the help and guidance of Soviet experts and Soviet advanced experience.
    However, the current level of the pharmaceutical industry is far behind the requirements of the country and the people. This is even more prominent in terms of quality. There are many rework, defective products, and returns in various enterprises and products. According to incomplete statistics from the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, among the 29 kinds of raw materials produced by its affiliated pharmaceutical factories in 1954, five kinds had to be reworked because the quality could not fully meet the pharmacopoeia regulations. The rework of procaine penicillin accounted for 40 percent of the total output for the whole year. Among the 70 kinds of tablets, 45 kinds often caused rework and returns due to unqualified disintegration, weight, content, uneven thickness, and black spots. The average rejection rate of 64 kinds of injections in the past nine months of last year was 12.88 percent. The rework rate of medical device factories is often between 10 and 50 percent, and the rejection rate is about 20 percent. A considerable part of these reworked and defective products have already left the factory and been "returned." In 1954, according to statistics of only 44 varieties, the value of returned goods was 2.05 million yuan. The returns of hexylresorcinol tablets from Kefa Pharmaceutical Factory accounted for 61.3 percent of the output.
    The "three more" phenomenon of more rework, more defective products, and more returns in the quality of pharmaceutical products has caused serious losses to the country. Because a large number of finished products are scrapped, the medicines and medical devices that could have been used to treat diseases lose their due use value. At the same time, the raw materials used to manufacture these products, the hard work of workers, and the consumption of machine operation, electricity, and fuel are wasted in vain, hindering the improvement of labor productivity. According to incomplete statistics of pharmaceutical industrial enterprises affiliated to the Ministry of Light Industry in 1954, the direct losses caused by rework and scrap were about 737,000 yuan. Medical devices worth about 500,000 yuan were overstocked due to poor quality. This has caused huge economic losses to the country.
    The sale of some unqualified drugs has also affected the health of the people. For example, the 3 million units of oil-based penicillin produced by the state-owned Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory last year had a coagulation phenomenon, so it "could not be drawn out or injected," causing redness and swelling of the patient's skin after injection.
    Poor quality also affects the comprehensive completion of enterprise plans. For example, Shenyang Medical Device Factory only completed the product output value plan for three months in 1954 due to a large number of finished products being reworked. The lowest month only completed 41.21 percent of the plan.
    What are the reasons for the current low quality of pharmaceutical industrial products?
    Judging from the situation of various units affiliated to the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, the first is that the enterprise's planning management and technical management are relatively weak. This is manifested in the unsoundness of various responsibility systems, the incomplete content of operating procedures, the superficiality of the procedures, and the laxity of the inspection system. Aluminum hydroxide tablets from Nanjing Pharmaceutical Factory had disintegration problems after absorbing water and being pressed into tablets because the particles were stored for too long, causing 420,000 tablets to be reworked. In February of this year, "Biofermin" medicine from Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory was not sterilized at the specified temperature, and the acid consumption of the cultured bacteria was unqualified, resulting in more than 33,000 kilograms of rework, accounting for more than 38 percent of the total monthly output. Shanghai Pharmaceutical Equipment Factory violated operating procedures and did not manufacture according to drawings. In February, the rework rate of surgical instruments reached more than 15 percent, and the rejection rate was 2.3 percent. A batch of aspirin tablets produced by Kefa Pharmaceutical Factory last October had unqualified disintegration and should not have been shipped, but under the pretext of "urgent tasks," they were allowed to be "shipped at risk."
    Secondly, in the trial production and manufacturing of new products, there is a common phenomenon of not following procedures, being eager for success, and acting rashly. Trial production is carried out without sufficient research, basic construction design is carried out without successful trial production, and production tasks are ordered without completion of construction and trial runs, resulting in poor quality and serious waste of manpower and materials. For example, hexylresorcinol tablets from Kefa Pharmaceutical Factory were blindly produced in large quantities without sufficient clinical trials, resulting in 330,000 bottles being recalled and more than 25,000 bottles being scrapped because the sugar coating of the tablets was too thick, which was announced in the newspaper. Shenyang Medical Device Factory started producing dental chairs, a new product in 1954, without making good production preparations, resulting in modifications during production. It was not until the fourth quarter that the finished product was produced after modifications from the second quarter.
    Third, some leading staff members of enterprises have different degrees of one-sided views on completing plans, focusing on output value and output, and neglecting other planned indicators such as quality. They believe that "output value and output indicators are the law and must be completed, and failure to complete quality is just a shortcoming." Shanghai No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory took the measure of ignoring social needs for three months last year due to failure to complete the output value plan, using high-priced products such as progesterone as the "trump card" to complete the output value plan, which was overstocked after production. In terms of quality, even the distilled water for injection, which is technically relatively simple, was impure, resulting in the scrapping of more than 170,000 units. The result of one-sided pursuit of output value plans is that they are complacent and proud after completing the output value plan, and cannot see the shortcomings in their work, which is the ideological root cause of the long-term unresolved problem of poor quality of pharmaceutical products.
    In addition, poor storage of medicines in the pharmaceutical sales department, some long-term overstocking resulting in deterioration of medicines, etc. are also one of the reasons for more rework.
    In view of the above situation, a series of tasks need to be carried out to improve the quality of medicines:
    First of all, planning management and technical management must be strengthened in enterprise management to establish a normal production order and to technically ensure continuous improvement of quality. At present, enterprises generally have operation plans and responsibility systems, but most of the operation plans only include output value and output indicators, but not quality cost indicators. The responsibility system itself is not sound, and the implementation process is not serious, and rewards and punishments are not clear. Therefore, the content of operation plans must be gradually enriched, the responsibility system must be improved, and some reward and punishment systems should be established accordingly, so as to quickly eliminate quality accidents caused by no one being responsible.
    In terms of strengthening technical management, the main tasks are to formulate and supplement product standards, implement and revise operating procedures, strengthen technical supervision and inspection, and strictly prohibit unqualified drugs from leaving the factory. This year, the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau plans to formulate quality standards for 21 major products such as X-ray machines, and revise operating procedures for 22 products such as sulfathiazole. After this work is completed, the production of many products will have something to follow.
    Secondly, do a good job in the trial production and manufacturing of new products. The task of trial production and manufacturing of new products in the pharmaceutical industry this year is very heavy. The planned new varieties to be put into production are 21 kinds, such as chloramphenicol, and there are 32 kinds of new product research and trial production projects. Not only are there many varieties (the new products put into production in 1954 were 10 kinds), but also the technology is complex. Accepting past lessons, in order to ensure quality, it is necessary to adhere to the procedures. New varieties that have not been formally tested and matured are prohibited from being put into production.
    Third, strengthen the education work on the importance of pharmaceutical product quality, so that all employees of pharmaceutical industrial enterprises (including enterprise leaders) can clearly recognize from the ideological perspective that the purpose of production is to protect people's health, thereby establishing a serious attitude towards quality and treating the guarantee of drug quality not only as an economic task, but also as a political task, and should "comprehensively complete the national plan on the premise of ensuring quality." If quality is not guaranteed, the more production, the more rework, defective products, and returns, the greater the losses to the country. Only by ideologically recognizing the importance of guaranteeing quality will we actively take measures to improve quality.
    Fourth, strengthen the combination of pharmaceutical production and sales, do a good job in the storage work in the pharmaceutical sales process, and strengthen the publicity and education work to the broad masses of drug users on the use and care of drugs.
    According to the deployment of the production work conference of the Ministry of Light Industry in April, national pharmaceutical factories, medical device factories, and joint state-private pharmaceutical factories have already launched or are about to launch a mass labor competition movement with the main content of opposing waste and improving product quality. This will be the beginning of further improving drug manufacturing technology and ensuring quality. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the movement and rely on the cooperation of the broad masses of workers and technicians to complete the task of improving quality and practicing economy. It should be clearly recognized that guaranteeing quality and practicing economy are consistent. Building economy on the basis of harming quality is the greatest waste.
    Pharmaceutical product manufacturing is a meticulous and complex scientific work. Therefore, in order to improve product quality, in addition to carrying out the above-mentioned work, relying on the broad masses of workers, and overcoming conservative thinking, we must also pay special attention to learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, actively strive for the guidance and help of scientific research institutions and health departments, and promote the advanced experience of brother factories.

    努力提高药品和医疗器械的质量
    金同珍
    几年来，我国医药工业有很大的发展。许多世界上最新的特效药品和重要医疗器械，如青霉素、磺胺、爱克司光机、短波电疗机等，解放前一向依靠国外进口，现在在苏联专家、苏联先进经验的帮助和指导下，都先后试制成功并大量生产了。
    但是，当前医药工业的水平还远远落后于国家和人民的要求，这在质量方面更加突出，各个企业和各种产品都有返工多、废品多、退货多的现象。据轻工业部医药工业管理局不完全的统计，所属药厂一九五四年生产的二十九种原料药，就有五种因质量不能全部符合药典规定而返工。青霉素普鲁卡全年因返工处理的竟达产量的百分之四十。在七十种片剂中，有四十五种经常因崩解度、重量、含量不合格，薄厚不一致，有黑点等而造成返工退货。六十四种针剂去年九个月的平均废品率为百分之十二点八八。医疗器械厂的返工率经常在百分之十至五十，废品率在百分之二十左右。在这些返工品和废品中不少一部分是已经出厂又“退货”的，一九五四年仅就四十四个品种的统计，退货的商品产值即为二百零五万元，科发药厂的己烷雷琐辛片退货占到产量的百分之六十一点三。
    医药产品质量上的返工多、废品多、退货多的“三多”现象，给国家带来的损失是严重的。因为大量成品的报废，就使得本来可供治疗疾病的药品和医疗器械失去了它应有的使用价值，同时使制造这些产品的原材料、工人的辛勤劳动和机器运转、电力燃料消耗等都白白地浪费掉，阻碍了劳动生产率的提高。一九五四年轻工业部所属医药工业企业不完全统计：因返工、报废而造成的直接损失共约七十三万七千多元，因为质量低劣而积压的医疗器械约值五十万元。这就在经济上给国家造成了巨大的损失。
    部分不合格药品出厂后，使人民健康也受到影响。如去年国营生化药厂所制的三百万单位油剂青霉素因有凝聚现象，“抽不出、打不进”，注射后使患者皮肤发生红肿。
    由于质量低劣同时也影响到企业计划的全面完成，如沈阳医疗器械厂，因为成品大量返工，一九五四年全年只有三个月完成产品产值计划，最低的月份只完成计划百分之四十一点二一。
    当前医药工业产品质量低劣的原因在哪里呢？
    从轻工业部医药工业管理局所属各单位的情况来看，首先是企业的计划管理和技术管理比较薄弱，这表现为各项责任制度不健全，操作规程内容不完整，流于形式，检验制度不严。南京药厂氢氧化铝片由于颗粒存放时间太长，吸水压片后崩解度不合格，造成四十二万片返工。西南药厂今年二月份“表飞鸣”药品在消毒时未按规定温度，培养出的菌种耗酸量不及格，造成三万三千多公斤返工，占全月产量百分之三十八强。上海医药器械厂由于违反操作规程，不按照图纸制造，二月份手术器械返工率达百分之十五以上，报废率百分之二点三。科发药厂去年十月生产一批醋柳酸药片，其崩解度不合格，本不应出厂，但在“任务很紧”的借口下，也就准予“冒险出厂”。
    其次，在新产品试制和制造工作上，普遍有不按程序办事，急于求成草率从事的现象。没有研究好就试制，没有试制好就搞基本建设设计，没有施工完毕和经过试车，就订生产任务，结果质量低劣，造成人力物力的严重浪费。如科发药厂己烷雷锁辛片由于未经充分临床实验，即盲目地大量生产，造成因片子糖衣包得太厚，而不得不登报收回三十三万多瓶，报废二万五千多瓶。沈阳医疗器械厂，一九五四年新产品牙科椅子，未作好生产准备工作就投料生产，结果边生产边修改，从第二季度一直修改到第四季度还未出成品。
    第三是企业领导工作人员中有不同程度的片面完成计划的观点，重产值产量，忽视质量等其他计划指标，认为“产值产量指标是法律，必须完成，质量完不成不过是缺点而已”。上海第一制药厂去年就有三个月因完不成产值计划而采取不顾社会需要，用黄体酮等高价产品作为完成产值计划的“王牌”，生产后就积压，而在质量方面，连技术比较简单的注射用蒸馏水也不纯，以致报废十七万多支。片面追求产值计划的结果，是完成了产值计划就沾沾自喜，骄傲自满起来，看不见工作中的缺点，这也就是医药产品质量低劣长期没有解决的思想根源。
    此外，在药品销售部门对药品保管不善，有的长期积压造成药品变质等也是返工多的原因之一。
    针对上述情况，提高药品质量，需要进行一系列工作：
    首先，在企业管理方面必须加强计划管理和技术管理，以建立正常的生产秩序，并从技术上保证质量的不断提高。目前各企业一般均有作业计划和责任制度，但是作业计划大都只有产值产量指标，而不包括质量成本指标，责任制度本身既不健全，执行过程中又不严肃，赏罚不明。因此必须逐步地充实作业计划内容，健全责任制度，并相应地建立一些奖惩制度。以便迅速消灭由于无人负责而造成的质量事故。
    在加强技术管理方面，主要是制定和补充产品标准，贯彻和修订操作规程，加强技术监督和检验工作，严禁不合格的药品出厂。今年医药工业管理局计划制定爱克司光机等二十一种主要产品的质量标准，修订磺胺噻唑等二十二种产品的操作规程。这个工作完成以后，将使许多产品的生产有所遵循。
    其次，作好新产品试制和制造工作。医药工业今年新产品试制和制造任务很大，计划投入生产的新品种有氯霉素等二十一种，新产品研究试制项目有三十二种，不仅品种多（一九五四年投入生产的新产品为十种）而且技术复杂。接受过去教训，为保证质量，必须坚持按程序办事，凡未经正式试制成熟的新品种，禁止投入生产。
    第三，加强重视医药产品质量的教育工作，使医药工业企业的全体职工（包括企业领导者），从思想上明确认识生产的目的是为了保障人民健康，从而树立严肃地对待质量的观点，把保证药品质量不仅当作经济任务，同时当作政治任务看待，应该“在保证质量的前提下，全面完成国家计划”。质量不保证，产得越多，返工、废品、退货也就越多，给国家带来的损失也就越大。只有从思想上认识到保证质量的重要意义，才会积极采取提高质量的措施。
      第四，加强药品产销工作的结合，做好药品销售过程中的保管工作，并加强向广大用药群众关于使用和爱护药品的宣传教育工作。
    根据轻工业部四月份生产工作会议的布置，各国营制药厂、医疗器械厂，和公私合营药厂，已经或即将开展以反对浪费，提高产品质量为主要内容的群众性的劳动竞赛运动，这将是进一步提高药品制造技术，保证质量的开端，必须加强对运动的领导，依靠广大职工同技术人员的合作来完成提高质量和厉行节约的任务。应当明确认识，保证质量厉行节约是一致的。把节约建筑在损害质量的基础上就是最大的浪费。
    医药产品制造工作是一项细致的复杂的科学工作，因此要提高产品质量，除了进行上述工作，依靠广大职工，克服保守思想外，还必须特别注意到学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验，主动争取科学研究机关和卫生部门的指导和帮助，推广兄弟厂的先进经验。
