The idea of going to other planets used to be just a brilliant fantasy in the minds of poets and novelists. Now it has become a task of great practical significance for scientists.

In 1903, the outstanding Russian scientist Tsiolkovsky, in his article "Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Engines," elaborated in detail the structure and flight theory of the interstellar travel tool—the liquid-fuel rocket—and made astonishingly concrete descriptions of the magnificent picture of future interstellar travel. It laid the scientific foundation for mankind's beautiful ideal of flying out of the Earth.

In the past fifty years, especially in the last decade, the progress of human knowledge, the high development of social productive forces, science, and technology have liberated the endless energy hidden inside matter. This makes it possible to conduct planned scientific research on fantastic plans for space travel based on modern technological achievements.

The fundamental problem of interstellar travel is to fight against the Earth's tenacious gravity.

Suppose we have a rocket ship with a speed of 850 kilometers per hour, and we want to fly to the moon. How much fuel would it take? Even if the rocket ship only weighs one kilogram, the fuel would weigh as much as nine thousand Earths! It can be seen that to overcome the Earth's gravity, it is impossible to rely on the continuous and persistent work of the engine, but on the huge speed of the rocket ship itself. Calculations indicate that an object with a speed of 7.9 kilometers per second (this is called the "circular velocity" of an object on Earth) can orbit the Earth continuously like the moon; an object with a speed of 11.2 kilometers per second (this is called the "escape velocity" of an object on Earth) can completely overcome the Earth's gravity and fly to the vast outer space.

Tsiolkovsky formulated the flight theory of rocket ships. This theory says that the speed of a rocket ship depends on the amount of fuel it carries and the jet speed of the rocket ship. Obviously, both of these factors are related to the nature of the fuel. Using the current liquid fuels (gasoline, alcohol, liquid hydrogen, etc.), the speed of the rocket ship can only reach 2.5 kilometers per second. This is quite far from the speed required for interstellar travel.

The peaceful application of atomic energy makes it possible to greatly increase the speed of rocket ships. By using a uranium boiler to heat an inert gas, the high-heat gas is rapidly sprayed backward, and the rocket ship moves forward at high speed. Last year, when the Soviet Union's first atomic power station began generating electricity, the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Nesmeyanov, said: "Interstellar travel is no longer a technical problem of tomorrow, but a technical problem of today."

Recently, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has established a permanent joint committee on interstellar communication and has immediately started work. The first step is to build an artificial satellite.

In fact, artificial satellites are not a new idea. It is the most radiant part of Tsiolkovsky's creative thought, and for fifty years this thought has guided the work of interstellar travel researchers.

The so-called artificial satellite is actually a rocket ship with a speed of 7.9 kilometers per second. Such a rocket ship can run continuously outside the atmosphere without consuming a drop of fuel, serving as a station for interstellar travel. A rocket ship departing from the ground only needs to have a speed of 7.9 kilometers per second to reach this station, add fuel, and then increase its speed by about 3.3 kilometers per second to reach "escape velocity" and fly out of the Earth.

The practical role of the station is to divide interstellar travel into two stages of voyage. In this way, the speed requirements for each stage of the voyage are greatly reduced, thereby greatly reducing the difficulties caused to the structure of the rocket ship. Therefore, the proposal of the artificial satellite design scheme has increased the possibility of interstellar travel.

But the significance of artificial satellites is far greater than a "station."

The most fundamental difficulty raised by interstellar travel lies in how to obtain sufficient speed to overcome the Earth's gravity. However, after overcoming the Earth's gravity and flying into outer space, interstellar travelers will encounter many unexpected difficulties.

First of all, the speed of the rocket ship cannot reach 11.2 kilometers per second all at once. A rocket ship driving so fast will burn up completely when it rubs against the air. Under normal circumstances, an acceleration of 40 meters per second per second is not easy for people to bear. At this time, people in the rocket ship feel their weight increase to four times that on the ground. This is called "overweight." People in "overweight" often feel a strong weight pressing against their body, and their nervous system, circulatory system, vision, and hearing organs will be damaged. But interstellar travelers only need to endure it for five minutes. How to fight the "overweight" phenomenon? This is a question to be studied.

Secondly, when the speed of the rocket ship reaches "escape velocity" and the engine is turned off, it will coast at a constant speed in space. At this time, the Earth's gravity has been overcome. But then the phenomenon of "weightlessness" occurs. Humans are accustomed to the gravity on Earth. If they suddenly leave the environment they have adapted to for generations, can they live normally? Scientists used rocket ships to take monkeys and mice to an altitude of 149 kilometers, and then threw them down (the monkeys were tied to a very comfortable rubber cushion, and the mice were placed in a very smooth cylinder). During the two or three minutes of accelerated descent to the ground, the monkeys and mice were "weightless." The experimental results showed that there were no abnormal physiological phenomena.

People living on an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at a speed of 7.9 kilometers per second are not subject to gravity. Therefore, it is entirely possible for doctors to test whether a person's normal living conditions can be maintained in a "weightless" state. We can make the artificial satellite rotate, and the centrifugal force of the rotation will replace gravity, giving people a normal sense of gravity. You can also let it rotate very quickly, making people on it feel "overweight," so as to study what harm the "overweight" phenomenon does to human functions. In this way, artificial satellites can become our base for studying living conditions outside the Earth.

Artificial satellites can also become a base for exploring the mysteries of outer space.

The Earth's atmosphere protects the Earth like armor, resisting many disasters from the outside. For example, ultraviolet rays in solar radiation that can harm the human body are mostly absorbed by a thin layer of ozone in the atmosphere and cannot reach the ground. Cosmic rays that are harmful to human physiological functions encounter the upper atmosphere of the Earth and transfer energy to air molecules, repeatedly causing so-called secondary radiation, so that the energy becomes smaller and smaller, and finally disappears in the stratosphere. Only a few can reach the ground. However, once out of the atmosphere, interstellar travelers will encounter the above-mentioned troublesome problems. Glass mixed with rare earth elements can absorb ultraviolet rays; but regarding the defense of cosmic rays, because we know too little about the nature of cosmic rays, we have not found a practical defense method. There is no doubt that artificial satellites built on the periphery of the Earth's atmosphere will help scientists carry out research in this area.

Space travel also needs to solve the problem of collisions with meteoroids. In outer space, there is a meteoroid with a mass of more than one gram every 100 kilometers on average. Meteoroids are fast and have great striking power. Even a one-meter-thick steel armor cannot withstand the attack of a ten-centimeter-heavy meteoroid. Therefore, it is necessary to study them in depth and grasp their regularity. This is also the task of artificial satellites.

In outer space, in interstellar travel, people's entire lives will change accordingly. In the absence of air covering, temperature changes are very drastic. For example, on the moon, the daytime temperature is 120 degrees Celsius, and the night temperature is minus 150 degrees Celsius, and the atmospheric pressure is almost zero. So, how will people live in this environment? What changes will occur in the physical and chemical properties of matter? If oxygen is artificially supplied and certain conditions of air pressure, temperature, and humidity are created, can plants and animals survive in this environment? These questions can be studied on artificial satellites. Therefore, artificial satellites should not only have rocket berths, devices for observing the sky, and huge radar equipment, but also the world's best physics and chemistry laboratories, the most unique plant greenhouses, and animal breeding rooms.

On artificial satellites, it is also possible to study some areas on Earth that have not yet been able to conduct on-site surveys, such as the Antarctic ice sheet, wide deserts, and large forests spanning tens of thousands of square kilometers. Artificial satellites will be used to study ocean currents in the ocean, the movement of Arctic and Antarctic ice floes, and the operation of cyclones. The results of these studies will greatly contribute to the development of geography and meteorology. Because artificial satellites are built above the high atmosphere, the distribution of temperature and pressure, the composition of gases, and the ionization of the air in the high atmosphere, mainly the stratosphere and ionosphere, can also be studied on-site. The conditions in the upper atmosphere not only affect the circulation of the atmosphere, but also affect the effect of solar radiation energy on life on Earth due to the existence of the ozone layer and other unknown layers. The study of the ionosphere is one of the necessary conditions for the further development of short-wave radio transmission. On artificial satellites, we can also study how to establish radio communication with future space ships. From the direction of today's work, the first rocket ship to fly to the moon in the future will be a radio-controlled, unmanned rocket ship. Therefore, it is very important to understand the transmission of radio waves in outer space.

Artificial satellites will have the world's most advanced observatories, and powerful radar equipment will draw maps of neighboring planets for us; telescopes and other instruments will play a greater role than on the ground, helping scientists further understand the physical conditions on each planet and explore the secrets of the planetary world. In the absence of atmospheric obstacles, it is also possible to study solar radiation more directly; scientists will be able to gradually grasp the materials and laws of physical changes on the sun. And in that cosmic space that is always dark night, the stars appear brighter, the light is more stable, and it is easier for astrophysicists to perform spectral analysis, thereby better understanding the nature, structure, movement, change, origin, and development of stars.

The establishment of artificial satellites also has other practical uses. For example, if artificial satellites can be established in space 35,800 kilometers away from the Earth, it will orbit the Earth in 24 hours. This is the same as the Earth's rotation period, so people on Earth will see it always hanging in a certain position in the sky and will not move. If we place three artificial satellites in spaces 120 degrees apart from each other, they can be used as relay stations for television and radio facsimile, and the transmission distance of television and radio facsimile will no longer be limited by the curvature of the Earth.

Scientists also want to absorb the rich and inexhaustible solar energy on artificial satellites and send it back to the ground for use. Scientists are also studying the use of solar energy as the power to start space ships. Let the powerful solar energy that is now wasted in outer space serve mankind.

The establishment of artificial satellites is the beginning of a new historical era for mankind living on the ground. This means that the era when mankind was bound to the surface of the Earth is gone forever. The outer space, which used to seem so mysterious and so unfathomable, will gradually reveal its true face to mankind.

Interstellar travel will guide mankind to gradually embark on the road of conquering outer space.

    征服宇宙空间的科学
    郑文光
    到别的星球去，从前只是诗人和小说家笔下的天才的想像。现在已成为对科学家具有重大实践意义的工作。
    一九○三年，卓越的俄罗斯科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基在他的“利用喷气机来探测宇宙”一文中，详细地阐述了星际航行的工具——液体燃料火箭——的构造和飞行理论，对未来星际航行的壮丽图景作了令人惊异的具体的描绘。它为人类飞出地球去的美丽理想，奠立了科学的基石。
    近五十年来，尤其是最近十年来，人类知识的进步，社会生产力、科学技术的高度发展，使蕴藏在物质内部的无穷无尽的能量得到了解放，这就使得宇宙航行的幻想性的计划，有可能在现代技术成就的基础上进行有计划的科学研究了。
    星际航行的根本问题，是跟地球的顽强的引力作斗争。
    假定我们有一具速度为每小时八百五十公里的火箭船，要飞到月亮去，得费多少燃料呢？即使火箭船只重一公斤，燃料就等于九千个地球那么重！可见，要克服地球的引力，是不能指靠发动机持久不断的工作的，得靠火箭船本身的巨大速度。计算指出，每秒七点九公里（这叫做地球上物体的“圆周速度”）的物体，能够像月球一样不停地绕地球转；每秒十一点二公里（这叫做地球上物体的“逃逸速度”）的物体，就能够彻底战胜地球引力，向茫茫的宇宙空间飞去。
    齐奥尔科夫斯基制定了火箭船的飞行理论。这理论说，火箭船的速度决定于所装载的燃料的数量和火箭船的喷气速度。显然，这两个因素都和燃料的性质有关。应用目前的液体燃料（汽油、酒精、液体氢等），火箭船的速度仅能达到每秒二点五公里。这离开星际航行所需要的速度是相当远的。
    原子能的和平应用使火箭船的速度有了大大提高的可能。应用铀锅炉加热惰性气体，高热的气体即急促向后喷出去，火箭船便高速向前推进。去年苏联第一个原子能发电站开始发电的时候，苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫就说：“星际航行已经不是明天的技术问题，而是今天的技术问题了。”
    最近，苏联科学院已经成立了星际交通常设联合委员会，并且马上就着手工作，第一步是建立一个人造卫星。
    人造卫星实际上也不是现在才想出来的。它是齐奥尔科夫斯基创造性的思想中最为光芒四射的一部分，五十年来这思想一直指导着星际航行研究者的工作。
    所谓人造卫星，实际上是一个速度达到每秒七点九公里的火箭船，这样的一个火箭船无需耗费一滴燃料，便可以在大气层之外不息地运行，作为星际航行的驿站。从地面出发的火箭船，只要也有每秒七点九公里的速度，驶到这个驿站，加燃料后，再增加约每秒三点三公里的速度，就可以达到“逃逸速度”，飞到地球外面去。
    驿站的实际作用是把星际航行分作两段航程，这样，每段航程所需要达到的速度要求便大大降低了，因而也大大减少了在火箭船结构上所引起的困难。所以，人造卫星设计方案的提出，使星际航行的可能性变得大了。
    但是人造卫星的意义要远比一个“驿站”重大得多。
    星际航行所提出的最根本的困难，在于怎样获得足够的速度，以战胜地球的引力。但是，在战胜地球引力、飞到宇宙空间以后，星际旅行家们还会碰到许多意想不到的困难。
    首先，火箭船的速度不可能一下子就达到每秒十一点二公里。开得这么快的火箭船，跟空气一摩擦，便会整个烧掉。一般情况下，每秒每秒四十公尺的加速度，对于人们已经是不容易忍受的了，这时候火箭船里的人即感觉体重增加到为地面时的四倍。这叫做“超重”。在“超重”中的人，往往会感到一股强大的压向自己身体的重量，在神经系统、循环系统、视觉和听觉器官方面都会受到损害。但是星际旅行家只消忍受五分钟就行了。怎样和“超重”现象作斗争呢？这是有待研究的问题。
    其次，火箭船的速度达到“逃逸速度”，发动机关掉了，它便等速地在空间中滑行。这时候，地球的引力已经被战胜了。但随着便产生了“失重”的现象。人类是习惯于地球上面的重力的，如果一下离开了这世世代代适应了的环境，能不能够正常地生活下去？科学家曾用火箭船把猴子和老鼠带到一百四十九公里的高空，然后，把它们（猴子是捆在很舒服的橡皮垫子上，老鼠则装在里面很光滑的圆筒内）扔下来，在这加速降落到达地面的二、三分钟当中，猴子和老鼠就是“失重”的，试验结果说明，它们在生理上没有发生不正常的现象。
    生活在以每秒七点九公里的速度绕地球转动的人造卫星上面的人，是受不到重力作用的。因此它完全有可能供医生们试验能不能够在“失重”的情况下维持一个人的正常生活条件。我们可以让人造卫星自转，自转的离心力就会代替重力，使人有正常重力的感觉。也可以让它自转得很快，使在上面的人感到“超重”，以便研究“超重”现象对人体机能有什么损害。这样，人造卫星便可以成为我们研究地球以外生活条件的基地。
    人造卫星还可以成为探索宇宙空间奥秘的基地。
    地球的大气层，像甲胄一样保护着地球，抵挡了外来的许多灾难。如太阳辐射中能伤害人体的紫外线，大部分被大气层中的一层薄薄的臭氧吸去，射不到地面上。对人的生理机能有害的宇宙线，遇到地球大气上层，就把能量传给空气分子，反复引起所谓次辐射，以至能量愈来愈小，终于在平流层（同温层）中消失，只有少数能达到地面。但是，一越出大气层外，星际旅行家们便会碰到上述种种令人头痛的问题。掺和着稀土元素的玻璃，可以吸收紫外线；但是关于宇宙线的防御，由于我们对宇宙线的性质了解得太少，还找不出切实可行的防御方法。毫无疑问，建立在地球大气外围的人造卫星，是有助于科学家进行这一方面的研究工作的。
    宇宙航行中还要解决跟流星体的碰撞问题。在宇宙空间中，平均每隔一百公里就有一颗质量在一公分重以上的流星体。流星体的速度高，打击力量大，一公尺厚的钢甲也经受不住十公分重流星体的袭击。因此，须要深入地加以研究，掌握它们的规律性，这也是人造卫星的任务。
    在宇宙空间中，在星际航行中，人的全部生活都要相应地发生变化。在没有空气被覆的情况下，温度变化非常剧烈。例如在月球上，白天为摄氏一百二十度，晚上则为摄氏零下一百五十度，大气压力差不多等于零。那末，人将怎样生活在这个环境里呢？物质的物理、化学性质将要发生些什么变化呢？如果人工供给氧气和创造了一定的气压和温度、湿度条件，植物和动物能不能够在这种环境下生存呢？这些问题，都可以在人造卫星上进行研究。因此在人造卫星上不但要有火箭停舶场、观测天空的装置、巨大的雷达设备；而且还要有世界上最优良的物理和化学实验室，最独特的植物温室和动物饲养房。
    在人造卫星上也可以对地球上某些至今尚未能进行实地勘测的地区，例如南极冰原、宽阔的沙漠、连绵数万方公里的大森林等进行研究。人造卫星将能用来研究大洋中的洋流、北极和南极浮冰的移动、气旋的运行，这些研究的结果都将大大地有助于地理学、气象学的发展。因为人造卫星建立在大气高层之上，因此对大气高层，主要是平流层和电离层的温度、压力的分布，气体的成分，空气的电离状况，也能作实地的研究。大气高层的状况不但影响到大气的环流，还由于有臭氧层和别的尚未知道的层次的存在，影响到太阳辐射能对地球生活的作用。电离层的研究是进一步发展短波无线电传送的必要条件之一。在人造卫星上，还可以研究如何跟将来的宇宙航船建立无线电联系。从今天的工作方向看，将来第一架飞到月球去的火箭船将是无线电操纵的、无人乘坐的火箭船，因此，了解无线电波在宇宙空间中的传送状况是非常重要的。
    在人造卫星上将有世界上最完善的天文台，强大的雷达设备将为我们描画出邻近各行星的地图；望远镜和其它仪器会比在地面上发挥更大的作用，帮助科学家进一步了解各个星球上面的物理条件，探明行星世界的秘密。在没有大气层的障碍的情况下，也可以更直接地研究太阳的辐射；科学家将能逐步掌握太阳上物理变化的材料和规律。而在那永远是暗夜的宇宙空间，星星看来更明亮，光芒更稳定，更便于天体物理学家进行光谱分析，从而更好地了解恒星的性质、结构、运动、变化、起源和发展。
    人造卫星的建立，还有其他的实际用处。比方说，如果能把人造卫星建立在离地球三万五千八百公里的空间，它就会在二十四小时内绕地球转一周，这跟地球自转周期相同，因此地球上的人将看到它老是挂在天空某个位置上，不会移动。如果我们在互相相隔一百二十度的空间，安放三个人造卫星，就可以作为电视和无线电传真的转播站，电视和无线电传真的传送距离就不再受到地球曲率的限制了。
    科学家还想在人造卫星上吸收丰富的、源源不绝的太阳能，送回地面上使用。科学家也在研究利用太阳能作为开动宇宙航船的动力。让现在浪费在宇宙空间中的强大的太阳能为人类服务。
    人造卫星的建立，对于生活在地面上的人类是一个新的历史纪元的开始。这意味着，人类被束缚在地球表面的时代一去不复返了。从前看来是那么神秘、那么深不可测的宇宙空间，将逐渐在人类面前揭露出它的真正面貌。
    星际航行将引导人类逐步走向征服宇宙空间的道路。
