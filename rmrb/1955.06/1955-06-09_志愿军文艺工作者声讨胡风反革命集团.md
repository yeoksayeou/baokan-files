Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th. The cultural and artistic workers, propaganda workers, and staff of the leading organs and various arms of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA) held a meeting on the 5th to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. Those present unanimously supported the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and demanded that the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng be severely punished according to law.
    At the symposium, Wang Yongnian, Deputy Director of the Cultural Department of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, reported on the counter-revolutionary crimes committed by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique against the Party and the people. He said: We must never tolerate counter-revolutionary elements infiltrating the revolutionary ranks to undermine the cause of socialist construction. We must further enhance our political vigilance, thoroughly eliminate the reactionary influence of Hu Feng, and wage a resolute struggle against all hidden elements who pretend to be revolutionary but actually oppose the revolution. Literary and art worker Wang Li pointed out in his speech: Lu Ling, a core member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, wrote a novel that distorted the image of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and published an anti-criticism article in the "Literary Gazette," which was essentially a declaration of war against the discipline of the Communist Party and the People's Army and against the ideology of the working class. He said: Lu Ling's malicious slander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was obviously deliberate.

    志愿军文艺工作者声讨胡风反革命集团
    新华社平壤七日电　中国人民志愿军领导机关和各兵种部队的文化艺术工作者、宣传工作者和机关干部在五日集会，声讨胡风反革命集团。到会的人一致拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议决议，并要求依法严惩反革命分子胡风。
    座谈会上，中国人民志愿军政治部文化部副部长王永年报告了胡风反革命集团所进行的反党反人民的罪恶事实，他说：我们绝不能容忍反革命分子钻入革命阵营里破坏社会主义建设事业，我们要进一步提高政治警惕性，彻底肃清胡风的反动影响，和一切伪装革命而实际反对革命的暗藏分子进行坚决的斗争。文艺工作者王里在发言中指出：胡风反革命集团的骨干分子路翎所作的歪曲中国人民志愿军形象的小说和他在“文艺报”上发表的反批评文章，实质上是对共产党和人民军队的纪律、对工人阶级思想宣战。他说：路翎对中国人民志愿军的恶毒污蔑，显然是别有用心的。
