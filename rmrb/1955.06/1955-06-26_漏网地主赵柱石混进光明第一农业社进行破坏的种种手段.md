Landlord Zhao Zhushi, Who Slipped Through the Net, Infiltrates the Guangming No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative and Engages in Various Sabotage Tactics
Wang Feng
Since its establishment, the Guangming No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Lidu Village, Sujia Township, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, has been plagued by problems: today, members want to split the cooperative; tomorrow, members want to withdraw; the cooperative's leadership is not united; the cooperative management committee meetings end in arguments; no one is responsible for leading production; members are passive and pessimistic, and lack enthusiasm for production... What is the reason? Only recently have people realized that it is the result of a landlord who slipped through the net infiltrating the cooperative to engage in conspiracies of sabotage.

This landlord who slipped through the net is called Zhao Zhushi. Before liberation, he owned 182 mu of land. None of his five family members participated in labor. He employed two long-term laborers year-round and hired short-term laborers during the busy farming season. Every year, he lent out 50 to 60 shi of grain at high interest rates, exploiting countless farmers.

During the land reform in Lidu Village, Zhao Zhushi devised various methods to conceal his landlord status in order to escape struggle. At that time, due to the low political awareness of the village workers and the masses, they were deceived by Yue Zhushi, and he was classified as a "small land lessor" during the class determination, and only 125 mu of his land was requisitioned. This cunning element of the landlord class slipped through the net in this way. Afterwards, he continued to hire laborers and lend money.

After the summer harvest of 1954, Lidu Village began to establish the Guangming No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative. This made Zhao Zhushi uneasy, because if everyone joined the agricultural cooperative, he would not be able to hire laborers, and he would not be able to lend money at high interest rates. What should he do? He pondered day and night: he was one of the few in the village who was educated. If he could take the opportunity to infiltrate the agricultural cooperative and become the cooperative director, he would have a solution. Therefore, he pretended to be active, was the first to sign up to join the cooperative, and spoke at the cooperative registration meeting about how he had "persuaded his whole family to agree to join the cooperative." Later, he often said to the masses:
	"Leading an agricultural cooperative is not simple. It won't do without some cultural knowledge!" He wanted to deceive the masses with these words in order to be elected as the cooperative director. As a result of his deception, although the masses did not elect him as the cooperative director when electing cooperative cadres, they elected him as a member of the cooperative management committee and concurrently as the accountant. In this way, he infiltrated the cooperative's leadership organization.

However, Zhao Zhushi's ambition did not die. In order to seize the leadership of the cooperative, he also provoked disunity among the cooperative members and created divisions within the cooperative. Lidu Village is divided into two villages, north and south. The south village has more members, with more than 40 households; the north village has fewer members, with a dozen households. Due to the insufficient work of the cooperative establishment work team, all three elected directors and deputy directors were from the south village. Zhao Zhushi seized this opportunity and, after the election, repeatedly convened secret meetings of the cooperative members in the north village (Zhao is from the north village). He incited everyone, saying: "None of the three directors elected by the cooperative are from the north village. Now all the power is in the hands of the south village! In terms of livestock and farm tools, our north village is stronger than the south village. I think it's better to split from the south village as soon as possible, so as not to be bullied by them!" After Zhao Zhushi's repeated instigation, some cooperative members agreed to split the cooperative. Under Zhao Zhushi's conspiracy, several cooperative members went to the south village to find the cooperative director to propose splitting the cooperative, demanding livestock and farm tools, and arguing to take back a cow that had originally been transferred from the north village to the south village production team. For a time, the cooperative was in chaos, and many cooperative members were not in the mood to go to the fields for production. Even more viciously, when the cooperative establishment work team and the cooperative director went to the north village to understand the reasons for the split and prepare to deal with the problem, Zhao Zhushi put on a smiling face and said: "It's still better not to split the cooperative. The south village production team is missing a cow, so I'll have my cow taken over to make up for it." The cooperative establishment work team and cooperative cadres did not see through this trick that Zhao Zhushi had created at the time. In order to solve the problem of the north village wanting to split the cooperative, after research and discussion with the cooperative members, they immediately elected Zhao Shengyi, an activist from the north village, as the deputy director. In this way, the problem of splitting the cooperative was calmed down.

Zhao Zhushi's conspiracy to create a split did not materialize, and then he more insidiously provoked the relationship between the director and deputy directors within the cooperative, attempting to bring down the cooperative. Cooperative director Yang Bingyan was a Communist Party member from a poor peasant background, who had always been active and enthusiastic and tried his best to run the cooperative well, but his work style was simple; another deputy director, Ma Tiansheng, was also an honest farmer who was very active in production, but was somewhat dissatisfied because he had not been elected director. Zhao Zhushi saw this point and tried to win over and use Ma Tiansheng to attack Yang Bingyan. He said to Ma Tiansheng: "Second Brother, when it comes to leading production, you are much stronger than Yang Bingyan. This time you were not elected director because Yang Bingyan was active among the cooperative members. I haven't slept well for several nights because of this." After hearing these words, Ma Tiansheng became even more dissatisfied with Yang Bingyan. Zhao Zhushi took the opportunity to say: "In the future, we should unite and offer more opinions on the cooperative's affairs to show Yang Bingyan what's what!" After Zhao Zhushi said this two or three times, Ma Tiansheng was trapped. From then on, Zhao Zhushi often went to Ma Tiansheng to give him ideas on how to attack Yang Bingyan. When the cooperative management committee met, Zhao Zhushi and Ma Tiansheng would find various excuses to oppose any opinions expressed by Yang Bingyan; Zhao Zhushi would strongly support any opinions proposed by Ma Tiansheng. Last winter, the cooperative members wanted to invest in buying two mule foals to expand production this spring. During the discussion at the cooperative management committee meeting, the livestock was not bought because Zhao Zhushi and Ma Tiansheng firmly opposed it.

Having won over Ma Tiansheng, Zhao Zhushi further openly attacked Yang Bingyan and undermined Yang Bingyan's prestige. He often said to the cooperative members: "What kind of Communist Party member is Yang Bingyan? He couldn't even grow his own crops well in the past, and he has no education. What ability does he have to lead the agricultural cooperative!" Yang Bingyan was continuously attacked, and his mood gradually declined, and he no longer cared much about the cooperative's affairs. Seeing that the time was ripe, Zhao Zhushi viciously engaged in activities to sabotage production. Once, when Yang Bingyan went to the county for a meeting, the leadership of the cooperative was the responsibility of Ma Tiansheng. As soon as Yang Bingyan left, Zhao Zhushi went to Ma Tiansheng and said: "Second Brother, no matter how great the cooperative's achievements are, they will be credited to Yang Bingyan. Look, Yang Bingyan is the one who goes to the county to talk about work; why don't we just manage less, make the cooperative's production a mess, and see what Yang Bingyan has to say when he goes to the county!" After hearing Zhao Zhushi's words, Ma Tiansheng relaxed his management of the cooperative's work, failed to arrange production on time, and shirked responsibility when things happened. Many cooperative cadres and members became passive and pessimistic about the situation in the cooperative. Some proposed withdrawing from the cooperative, and some stayed in their rooms all day sleeping. A lot of manure accumulated in the cooperative, but no one was responsible for hauling it to the fields; the weeds in the wheat fields grew tall, but no one led anyone to hoe them; particularly seriously, nine livestock died in a row, and no one cared. More than 400 mu of wheat fields grew poorly because they were sparsely planted, had a lot of weeds, and had little manure. People outside the cooperative said: What kind of agricultural cooperative is this? How can it lead the way to socialism?

Whether the cooperative members' work points are reasonable is an important link in whether the cooperative can be consolidated. Zhao Zhushi understood this, and he had long intended to sabotage this aspect. He used his stolen accounting authority to deliberately record the cooperative members' workdays incorrectly, in an attempt to make the cooperative members quarrel with each other over workdays when dividing dividends in the summer harvest. Cooperative member Li Zhide did seventeen workdays in about twenty days, but Zhao Zhushi only recorded twelve, while Chen Dizhu also did seventeen workdays at the same time, but was recorded as nineteen; Shang Kerang did fourteen workdays, but not even one was recorded. Zhao Zhushi also deliberately recorded the grass and fodder that the cooperative members handed over to the cooperative to feed the livestock incorrectly. According to regulations, the amount of grass and fodder handed over by the cooperative members should be announced on time, but Zhao Zhushi kept delaying the settlement and announcement; later, after repeated urging from everyone, the grass and fodder accounts were announced, but because the numbers did not match, many cooperative members were very dissatisfied, and some misunderstood and quarreled with each other.

Zhao Zhushi's series of sabotage activities gradually aroused the suspicion of some cadres and cooperative members, but at first they were all paralyzed by his "small land lessor" status. Therefore, although the district and township rectified this cooperative several times, they failed to completely solve the problem.

In February of this year, the Xianyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a work team to Lidu Village. After more than a month of investigation and research, and analysis based on various materials and evidence, they completely exposed the true face and insidious and vicious sabotage crimes of the landlord class element Zhao Zhushi. The cooperative members could not suppress the anger in their hearts, expelled him from the cooperative, and filed a complaint with the Xianyang County People's Court. The Xianyang County People's Court convened a public trial on March 14, punished Zhao Zhushi according to law, reclassified him as a landlord, and confiscated all his existing land, draft animals, farm tools, and houses, except for the share that his family should have received.

Through exposing and sentencing the landlord class element Zhao Zhushi for his sabotage crimes, the local workers and the masses have received a great education. Deputy Director Ma Tiansheng and more than a dozen cooperative members in the north village, who had been won over and used by Zhao Zhushi, also woke up and regretted being fooled by the class enemy. Ma Tiansheng reviewed the mistakes he had made in the past due to being deceived. Some cooperative members who had wanted to withdraw from the cooperative in the past have all dispelled the idea of withdrawing. The cooperative members' thinking has been clarified, everyone is closely united, and their enthusiasm for production is particularly high. Recently, all the cooperative members have invested 750 yuan in the cooperative and added three livestock, and have begun to expand production. Several farmers outside the cooperative are also actively requesting to join the cooperative.

In the past, the Guangming Cooperative was said to be not bright, but now it has become a truly Guangming Cooperative.

    漏网地主赵柱石混进光明第一农业社进行破坏的种种手段
    王枫
    陕西省咸阳县苏家乡李都村光明第一农业社，自从建立起来就不断发生问题：今天社员要分社，明天社员要退社，社的领导工作人员不团结，社管理委员会开会就吵架，生产没人负责领导，社员消极悲观，生产劲头不大……。原因究竟在哪里呢？最近人们才明白：原来是一个漏网地主混进社来进行阴谋破坏的结果。
    这个漏网地主叫赵柱石，解放前共有土地一百八十二亩，全家五口人没有一个参加劳动，长年雇着两个长工，农忙时还要雇短工；每年平均放出五、六十石粮食的高利贷，不知剥削了多少农民。
    李都村实行土地改革时，赵柱石为了逃避斗争，想出了各种办法隐瞒他的地主成份。当时由于村工作人员和群众政治觉悟低，受了越柱石的欺骗，在划分阶级成份时，给他订了个“小土地出租者”，仅征收了他一百二十五亩土地。这个狡猾的地主阶级分子，就这样漏了网。以后，他还是照常雇工、放账。
    一九五四年夏收后，李都村开始建立光明第一农业社。这使得赵柱石不安起来，因为大家要都参加了农业社，他就雇不到工，高利贷也放不成了。怎么办呢？他日日夜夜地盘算：村里要数自己有文化，如果能趁机会混进农业社，想法当个社主任，就有办法了。于是，他就假装积极，第一个报名入了社，并在入社报名大会上讲了他“说服全家人同意入社”的经过。以后他又经常向群众说：
  “领导农业社不简单，没有点文化知识可不行啊！”他想用这些话欺骗群众，达到当选社主任的目的。由于他欺骗的结果，在选举社干部时，群众虽然没有选举他当社主任，却选他当了社的管理委员会委员兼会计，这样，他就混进了社的领导组织。
    但是赵柱石的野心并没有死。为了夺取社的领导权，他又挑拨社员之间的团结，制造社内的分裂。李都村共分南北两个村，南村社员较多，有四十多户；北村社员较少，有十几户。由于建社工作组的工作做得不够，选举的三个正副主任都是南村人。赵柱石抓住这个机会，在选举后，连续就召集北村的社员（赵是北村人）举行秘密会议，他煽动大家说：“社里选的三个主任，北村没有一个，这下大权都掌握在人家南村手里了！论牲口，论农具，咱北村都比南村强，我看不如趁早和南村分社，免得受人家的欺负！”经过赵柱石再三挑拨，一些社员同意了分社。有几户社员在赵柱石的阴谋指使下，就到南村找社主任提出分社，要牲口和农具，并争吵着牵回去了原来由北村调配到南村生产组的一头牛。一时闹得社内混乱起来，许多社员也没有心情下地生产。更毒恶的是，当建社工作组和社主任到北村了解要分社的原因，准备处理这个问题时，赵柱石又装出一副笑脸说：“社还是不分好，南村生产组少了一头牛，把我那一头牛牵过去补上。”建社工作组和社干部们对赵柱石一手制造的这个鬼把戏，当时没有看清楚。他们为了解决北村要分社的问题，经过研究和社员们开会讨论，立即补选了北村社员积极分子赵胜义担任副主任。这样，分社的问题算是平息了。
    赵柱石制造分社的阴谋没有实现，接着更阴险地挑拨社内正副主任之间的关系，企图把社搞垮。社主任杨秉彦是个贫农出身的共产党员，一贯积极热情，极力想把社办好，只是工作方式简单；另一个副主任马天升，也是老实农民，生产很积极，但因为自己没有被选上主任有些不满意。赵柱石看准了这一点，就设法拉拢利用马天升，打击杨秉彦。他对马天升说：“二哥，要说领导生产，你可比杨秉彦强得多，这回没有选你当主任，是人家杨秉彦在社员里活动了。我为这事气的几个晚上都没睡好觉。”马天升听了这些话，就越发对杨秉彦不满。赵柱石趁机会又说：“今后咱们应该团结在一块，对社里的事多提些意见，给他杨秉彦个样子看看！”经过赵柱石这么三说两说，马天升便上了圈套。从此，赵柱石经常去找马天升，给他出主意打击杨秉彦。社管理委员会开会时，杨秉彦发表任何意见，赵柱石和马天升都找各种藉口反对；马天升提出任何意见，赵柱石都极力支持。去年冬天，社员们想投资买两条骡驹子，准备今春扩大生产。在社管理委员会议上讨论时，就由于赵柱石和马天升坚决反对，结果牲口没有买成。
    赵柱石拉拢住了马天升，便进一步公开打击杨秉彦，破坏杨秉彦的威信。他经常对社员们说：“杨秉彦是个啥共产党员，过去连自己的庄稼都种不好，又没有文化，有啥能力领导农业社！”杨秉彦连续受到打击，情绪逐渐低落，对社里的事情也不多管了。赵柱石见时机已到，便狠毒地进行破坏生产的活动。有一次，杨秉彦到县里开会，社的领导由马天升负责。杨秉彦刚走，赵柱石就找马天升说：“二哥，社里的功劳再大，也是人家杨秉彦的，你看上县开会谈啥工作，都是人家杨秉彦去；干脆咱们不如少管事，把社的生产弄个稀烂，看他杨秉彦到县上去说个啥！”马天升听了赵柱石的话，对社里的工作就放松了管理，不按时安排生产，有事也推拖不管。许多社干部和社员们看到社里这种情况，都产生了消极悲观情绪，有的提出要退社，有的整天闷在屋里睡大觉。社里积的许多粪没人负责往地里拉；麦地里的草长了多高也没有人领导去锄；特别严重的是一连死了九条牲口没人管，有四百多亩麦地因为种的稀，加上草多、粪少，长得不好。社外群众说：这叫啥农业社，怎么能带头到社会主义去呢？
    社员劳动工红是否合理，是社能不能巩固的重要一环。赵柱石懂得这一点，在这方面他也早就蓄意破坏。他利用窃取的会计职权，故意给社员们记错劳动日，企图到夏收分红时使社员们为劳动日互相争吵。社员李志德在二十天左右的时间，做了十七个劳动日，赵柱石只给记了十二个，陈砥柱在同时也做了十七个劳动日，却记了十九个；商克让做了十四个劳动日，连一个也没有给记。对社员们交到社里喂牲口的草料，赵柱石也同样地故意记错。按照规定，社员们交的草料数目应该按时公布，但赵柱石一直拖延不结算公布；以后在大家多次催促下，才把草料账目公布出来，但因为数目不符，许多社员都非常不满，有的互相误会争吵起来。
    赵柱石这一系列的破坏活动，渐渐引起了一些干部和社员的怀疑，但开始都被他的“小土地出租者”成份麻痹了。因此，区和乡虽然对这个社整顿过几次，但都没能彻底解决问题。
    今年二月间，中共咸阳县委会派工作组来到李都村，经过一个多月的调查研究，根据各方面的材料对证分析，才彻底揭露了地主阶级分子赵柱石的真实面目和阴险毒辣的破坏罪行。社员们压不住心里的怒火，把他清除出社，并向咸阳县人民法院提出了控告。咸阳县人民法院在三月十四日召开公审大会，依法惩办了赵柱石，并把他改订为地主成份，把他现有的土地、耕畜、农具和房屋等，除他家应分得的一份外，全部没收。
    通过揭露和判处地主阶级分子赵柱石的破坏罪行，当地工作人员和群众都受到了很大的教育。曾被赵柱石拉拢利用过的副主任马天升和北村十多户社员，也都清醒过来，悔恨自己上了阶级敌人的当。马天升检讨了过去因受欺骗造成的错误。过去有些要退社的社员，都打消了退社的念头。社员思想澄清了，大家都紧密团结起来，生产情绪特别高涨。全体社员最近向社投资了七百五十元，添了三头牲口，开始扩大生产。社外有几户农民也积极要求入了社。
    过去人称光明社不光明，现在已变成了名符其实的光明社了。
