Comprehensive Survey Work in the Yangtze River Basin Unfolds

More than one thousand surveyors are in the Yangtze River basin in Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, collecting data for the development and management of the Yangtze River.

Currently, five topographic survey teams affiliated with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission are further surveying areas suitable for building reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches of the Han River. River reconnaissance and geographical surveys of the upper reaches and tributaries of the Jialing River, Xiang River, and Han River have also commenced. Geological prospecting teams dispatched by the Ministry of Geology of the People's Republic of China are also collecting engineering and geological data for the management of the Han River.

The survey work in the Yangtze River basin began in the spring of 1950. Over the past few years, surveyors have traveled throughout the Daba Mountains, Qinling Mountains, and the Three Gorges, traversing the primitive forests of the upper reaches of the Jialing River and Min River. They have measured the precise leveling of the Yangtze River and its tributaries, the Han River, Jialing River, Wujiang River, and Min River; surveyed and mapped topographic maps of the entire waterway of the Yangtze River; completed more than 15,000 kilometers of river reconnaissance work on the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the main tributaries of the Han River, and found eighty to ninety locations suitable for building reservoirs.

In order to provide necessary hydrological data for the planning and design of the development and management of the Yangtze River, the number of hydrological stations distributed in the Yangtze River and Han River basins has increased to more than 1,190. The hydrological workers at these stations live in sparsely populated deep mountains and valleys, recording hydrological and meteorological conditions such as the water level, flow rate, rainfall, wind force, wind direction, and temperature of the Yangtze River, Han River, and various tributaries every day, and reporting them to water conservancy authorities at all levels.

### 长江流域的勘测工作全面展开

    长江流域的勘测工作全面展开
    一千多勘测工作人员正在长江流域的湖北、陕西、四川、湖南和江西等省为开发和治理长江搜集资料。
    现在，长江水利委员会所属的五个地形测量队正在汉水的上游和中游适于建筑水库的地区进一步作测量工作。嘉陵江、湘江和汉水上游及其支流的河道查勘、地理调查等工作也已展开。中华人民共和国地质部派出的地质普查队，也在为治理汉水搜集有关工程的和地质的资料。
    长江流域的勘测工作是从一九五零年春天开始的。几年来，勘测工作者踏遍了大巴山、秦岭和三峡，穿越了嘉陵江、岷江上游的原始森林。测量了长江及其支流汉水、嘉陵江、乌江、岷江等的精密水准；测绘了长江的全部水道地形图；完成了长江上、中游支流和汉水干支流一万五千多公里的河道查勘工作，并寻找了八、九十处适宜修建水库的地址。
    为了给开发和治理长江的规划、设计提供必要的水文资料，分布在长江、汉水流域的水文测站已增加到一千一百九十多个。这些站的水文工作者住在人烟稀少的深山幽谷中，每天把长江、汉水和各个支流的水位、流量、雨量、风力、风向、气温等水文、气象情况记载下来，报送给各级水利机关。　（新华社）
