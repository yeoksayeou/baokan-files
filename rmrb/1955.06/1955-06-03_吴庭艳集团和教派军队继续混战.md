Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st. Saigon Dispatch: The civil war in South Vietnam continues. A spokesperson for the Ngô Đình Diệm army said on May 31st that a regiment of Ngô Đình Diệm's army is advancing towards the Seven Mountains area between Hà Tiên Province and Châu Đốc Province in western South Vietnam. This area is close to the Cambodian border and is currently under the control of Lê Quang Vinh (aka Ba Cụt), a leader of the Hòa Hảo sect.

Taking advantage of the fact that a large number of Ngô Đình Diệm's troops are tied down in battles with the Hòa Hảo army, the Cao Đài army entrenched northwest of Saigon has also begun operations. A spokesperson for the Ngô Đình Diệm army said that the Cao Đài army launched a "vigorous offensive" against the Ngô Đình Diệm army in Trảng Bàng, fifteen miles northwest of Saigon. He admitted that there were casualties on both sides.
