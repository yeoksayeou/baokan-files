    I Learned Many Things
    Zhang Yanrun, Technician of Beijing People's Machine Factory
    This time, the First Ministry of Machine Building sent me to work at the Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia, which gave me the opportunity to learn many things.
    After participating in the machine installation and demonstration work, I clearly saw that the design of Czechoslovakian machines is advanced and the quality is very high. All machines are very convenient and flexible to operate. Like the tracer milling machine and tracer lathe in the industrial hall, it can automatically process various irregularly shaped parts with high precision according to the model of the part you want. There is a huge universal excavator in the West Square, with a maximum lifting weight of 25 tons and a total machine weight of over 80,000 tons. However, it only takes one person sitting in a chair to operate it, and they can freely command this large machine. These automated and semi-automated machines greatly reduce the physical labor of workers and improve labor productivity. All the transmission systems of Czechoslovakian machines, such as pulleys and gears, are covered with protective covers. This not only reduces the damage of the parts and prolongs the life of the machine, but also ensures the safe production of workers.
    Through the technical exchange work of the exhibition, Czechoslovakian experts provided us with great technical assistance. Many of our factories bought Czechoslovakian machines, but due to the lack of technical knowledge, they could not master them well. Either they broke the machines and could not repair them, or they did not know how to use many accessories, and some machines had not even been installed for a long time after they were purchased. During the exhibition, Czechoslovakian experts went to factories to help solve many technical problems and also introduced many advanced technical experiences.
    I accompanied experts to factories several times. The high level of labor enthusiasm of Czechoslovakian experts and workers left me with a very deep impression and education. Every time, as soon as they arrived at the factory, they immediately changed into work clothes and went to the workshop to see the machines. They never agreed to rest before they found the cause of the problem. When answering questions raised by Chinese workers, they were always very enthusiastic and patient until you completely understood. At the end of each work session, the experts always asked:
  “Are there any more questions?” They would only return to the exhibition hall after being told there were no more problems.
    I was also deeply moved by the revolutionary optimism of the Czechoslovakian experts. When a problem could not be found for a long time, they were not impatient or distressed. It was like this in our factory. The grinding wheel spindle of a Czechoslovakian grinder purchased by the Beijing People's Machine Factory vibrated, resulting in very poor precision of the processed parts. Expert Majkus went to our factory. For a long time, he could not find the cause of the vibration, but his attitude was very natural. He put his hands on his hips and hummed a tune. His eyes were fixed on the motor and gearbox of the machine tool, and he kept thinking about the cause of the fault. Finally, the problem was completely solved.
    I am a young technician who has been out of school for less than two years. I have participated in machine design work in the past, but I rarely considered how to make the machine easy for workers to operate and ensure workers' safe production. I realized that this is a matter of the designer's standpoint. At present, this shortcoming is still very common among young technicians like me. In the future, I must stand in the position of the workers to carry out design work, and try to make the machine easy and flexible to operate, reduce the physical labor of the workers, and pay close attention to the safety of the workers in operation. I also often encounter difficulties in my work, and my attitude towards these difficulties is not calm enough. I also often feel a lack of sufficient courage to overcome difficulties, and even feel discouraged. Today, I have personally seen how Czechoslovakian experts and workers treat their work. It is precisely because of the enthusiastic labor of thousands of workers and experts that Czechoslovakia has achieved great success in ten years of socialist construction. In the future, I must overcome my shortcomings, learn from the labor enthusiasm and revolutionary optimism of Czechoslovakian experts, and contribute all my strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    我学到了许多东西
    北京人民机器厂技术员　张延润
    这次，第一机械工业部派我到捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会工作，使我有机会学习到了许多东西。
    在参加了机器安装和表演工作以后，我清楚地看到了捷克斯洛伐克机器的设计是先进的，质量都是非常高的。所有的机器操纵起来都非常方便和灵活。像工业馆中的仿型铣床和仿型车床，它可以按照你所要零件的模型，自动加工出精密度很高的各种不规则形体的零件来。西广场上有一台巨大的万能挖掘机，它的最大起重量是二十五吨，机器的全部重量有八万多吨，但只消一个人坐在椅子上操作，就可以自如地指挥这部大机器。这些自动化和半自动化的机器，大大减轻了工人的体力劳动，提高了劳动生产率。捷克斯洛伐克机器所有的传动系统，如皮带轮、加齿轮等，都是用包护罩罩起来的，这样不但可以减少机件的损坏，延长机器的寿命，同时也保证了工人的安全生产。
    通过展览会的技术交流工作，捷克斯洛伐克专家给予我们技术上的帮助是很大的。我们许多工厂，买了捷克斯洛伐克机器，因为缺乏技术知识，掌握不好。不是把机器使坏了修理不好，就是不知道很多附件的使用方法，甚至有些机器买来很长时间还没有安装好。在展览期间，捷克斯洛伐克专家下厂帮助解决了许多技术问题，还介绍了许多先进的技术经验。
    我曾陪专家下过几次工厂。捷克斯洛伐克专家和工人的高度的劳动热情，给我十分深刻的印象和教育。每一次都是这样，他们一到工厂，马上就换上工作服下车间去看机器。在还没有找出问题的原因之前，他们从来也不答应休息。在解答中国工人提出的问题时，他们总是非常热情和耐心，直到你彻底明白为止。每次工作结束时，专家总要问：
  “还有什么问题吗？”直到说没有问题了，他们才回展览馆。
    我还深深感到了捷克斯洛伐克专家的革命的乐观主义精神。当一个问题长时间找不出原因时，他们不急躁，也不苦恼。在我们工厂里就是这样。北京人民机器厂购买的一部捷克斯洛伐克磨床的砂轮主轴发生震动，以致加工出来的零件的精密度很差。专家玛依库斯到我们厂里去。很久，他也找不出震动的原因，但他的态度很自然，双手叉着腰，嘴里还照旧哼着乐曲。他的两眼却目不转睛地注视着机床的马达和变速箱，脑子里不停地思索着故障发生的原因，最后，问题还是得到了彻底的解决。
    我是一个刚出校门还不到两年的青年技术员。过去也参加过机器设计工作，但我在工作中很少考虑怎样使机器便于工人操作、保证工人安全生产这些问题。我体会到，这是设计工作者的立场问题。目前，像我一样的青年技术员中，存在这种缺点的还很普遍。今后，我一定要站在工人的立场来进行设计工作，尽量使机器操纵起来方便灵活，减少工人的体力劳动和十分注意工人在操作中的安全。我在工作中也常常遇到困难，我对待这些困难的态度是很不够冷静的。我也常常感到缺乏足够的勇气来克服困难，甚至有灰心丧气的时候。今天，我亲眼看到了捷克斯洛伐克的专家和工人是怎样对待工作的，正是千千万万工人和专家这种热情的劳动，才使得捷克斯洛伐克在十年社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。我今后一定要克服自己的缺点，学习捷克斯洛伐克专家的劳动热情和革命的乐观主义精神，在祖国的社会主义建设事业中贡献出自己的一切力量。
