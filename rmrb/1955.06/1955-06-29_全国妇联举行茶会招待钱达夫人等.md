At 10 o'clock, the hosts warmly welcomed the arrival of the distinguished guests. In an atmosphere full of joy and friendship, a cordial conversation began. In groups of three or five, they talked about the friendship between the people and women of China and India, about the culture and art of the two countries, and the lives of women and children in both countries. They even chatted like the closest of friends.

At the tea party, Ms. Gul Badan, Ms. A. Guha, Ms. Suryamukhi Devi, and Ms. Mira Chakravarti performed dances and songs. The hosts repeatedly applauded their gentle and graceful dance moves and moving singing.

Chinese female artists Li Zaiwen, Xin Fengxia, Liu Shufang, and others also gave brilliant performances for the guests.

At the end of the tea party, the guests and hosts enthusiastically signed autographs and took photos together. Xin Fengxia gave a delicate small fan to Ms. Guha, and Ms. Guha took off a pair of beautiful red bracelets from her wrist and gave them to Xin Fengxia. The All-China Women's Federation also presented the distinguished guests with some magazines and pictorials about women and children in New China.

It was almost one o'clock in the afternoon before the guests and hosts reluctantly shook hands and said goodbye.
