Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, June 23rd (TASS):
Esteemed Chairman! Esteemed representatives!

    First of all, I would like to express, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, my heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Robinson, the Mayor of San Francisco, for the hospitality he has extended to us in this very fine city.

    Today we are commemorating and celebrating the tenth anniversary of the United Nations. This is an important and historic day.

    These days, hundreds of millions of people around the world will be paying particular attention to everything that is said here about the activities of the United Nations in the past.

    The United Nations was established during the Second World War. At the time of its foundation, the war was still raging on the territory of many European countries, in vast regions of Asia, and in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Against their will, the majority of humanity was drawn into a war whose scale and grave consequences were unprecedented.

    At that time, the renowned anti-Hitler coalition was formed, led by the Soviet Union, the United States of America, and Great Britain. It inspired the selfless liberation struggle of the peoples of various countries who were under attack by the fascist aggressors and were experiencing difficult times.

    Good and friendly relations developed among the countries of the anti-Hitler coalition during the war. The imminent danger of being enslaved by fascism brought these countries closer together. It also united them to establish the United Nations in order to jointly maintain international peace and security after the end of the war.

    The foundation of this organization was laid in the "Four-Nation Declaration on General Security," signed in Moscow on October 30, 1943, by the representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and China. This work was completed here in San Francisco, where the United Nations Charter was signed on June 26, 1945, after careful and thorough deliberation at the first conference of the United Nations.

    The United Nations Charter begins by stating that, "We the peoples of the United Nations, determined... to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow on mankind." "To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war" – this is the fundamental and supreme task of the United Nations. There is no more important task for the people of all countries than to prevent another world war. There is no nobler goal for the United Nations than to seek peace, friendship, and cooperation among the peoples of all countries.

    We all must remember this and must recognize the great significance of the tasks entrusted to the United Nations. This is our sacred responsibility.

    However, we must not close our eyes to the facts.

    We cannot ignore the rather serious tensions that currently exist in international relations, which are being constantly aggravated by the propaganda of a new war. Even more so, we cannot disregard the fact that the further escalation of these tensions endangers the maintenance of peace and creates the danger of a new war.

    In recent years, some countries have engaged in an unprecedented arms race, which has placed a heavy burden of military expenditure on the broad masses.

    Atomic and hydrogen weapons are being stockpiled on an ever-increasing scale; given the dangerous consequences of this situation, it is causing understandable anxiety among the peoples of all countries.

    Large-scale construction of military bases is underway in the territories of other countries. The fact that these bases are located thousands of kilometers away from the borders of the countries that are building them shows that the establishment of these bases is by no means for defensive purposes.

    But can the people in the countries where these bases are being built next to them, as well as in the countries where someone is building these bases on their territory, feel at ease?

    In Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world, more and more military blocs and alliances are being established. Recently, there have even been attempts to drag some small countries in the Near East and Middle East into such military alliances by all possible means, even though doing so goes against the will of the people of these countries. These military alliances are clearly aimed at certain countries, which demonstrates their imperialist and aggressive nature. Things have even reached the point where agreements have been concluded that enable West Germany to be remilitarized and to participate in military alliances that are known to be aggressive. These blocs and alliances, in turn, inevitably prompt the other side to organize defensive alliances as well.

    If the propaganda of a new war, which has recently turned into dangerous atomic warfare propaganda, continues unhindered in certain countries, if the arms race and the construction of the aforementioned military bases, which are being built not for defense but for attacking other countries, continue to intensify, and if more military alliances aimed at other countries continue to be pieced together for these purposes, then international tensions will further escalate. Following this path means rapidly moving towards a third world war.

    Can it be disregarded that the people all over the world do not want a new war, and they will severely condemn the aggressor, that is, those who will unleash another world war? Isn't it a proof that the movement of the people all over the world to prevent a new war and to fight against any attempt by the imperialist aggressive forces to launch another world war is growing? There is no doubt that under this circumstance – and of course, with the appropriate self-defense preparation of peace-loving countries – the aggressive side which launches a new war will be forcefully condemned as aggressors, and will be in a completely isolated position morally and politically in the eyes of the people of the world, and that will predetermine its inevitable failure.

    On the other hand, we cannot fail to see that we have enough facts today to prove that there are already tested paths that can lead to lasting peace and the consolidation of friendship between countries.

    Some of these facts should be mentioned.

    It has been two years since the Korean War ended due to the initiative of peace-loving countries. The Korean armistice has made a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue possible. Now, the peoples of North and South Korea should be helped to restore the unification of their country, which is in accordance with the wishes of the Korean people.

    Last year's Geneva Conference ended the war in Indochina in a way that broadly conformed to the Indochinese people's desire for national liberation. The significance of the Geneva Accords can be clearly seen from the fact that Asians endorsed it. The Geneva Accords have also been correctly understood in Europe and other parts of the world.

    About a month ago, the Austrian State Treaty was concluded. It was agreed that Austria would not allow foreign military bases to be established on its territory, that it would not participate in military blocs, and that it would become a neutral country like Switzerland. The initiative shown by the Soviet Union in this regard received the necessary support from other relevant countries, and most importantly, from Austria itself. As a result, negotiations led to the resolution of another important international issue in Europe.

    An extremely important event in recent times was the adjustment of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia during the visit of the Soviet government delegation to Belgrade. The improvement in relations between the two countries, resulting from the Soviet-Yugoslav negotiations, is in accordance with the deep aspirations and fundamental interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. This fact also greatly contributes to the easing of political tensions in Europe and is in line with the need to consolidate universal peace.

    In this regard, it is necessary to point out that various rumors spread by some in the West in order to distort the significance of the Belgrade talks and their results and to diminish their importance are unfounded. It should be emphasized that the agreement expressed in the joint declaration reached by the Soviet and Yugoslav countries on improving and developing friendly relations between the two countries is not based on some temporary consideration, but on the realization that such relations are of great significance to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, to easing international tensions, and to establishing necessary trust between countries.

    Of particular note is the visit of Indian Prime Minister Nehru to the Soviet Union. This visit is of great significance for further consolidating the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India, for easing international tensions, and for consolidating peace.

    The few facts I have just listed, and many other facts, all prove that the policy of easing international tensions pursued by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries is constantly producing positive results.

    The Soviet government's proposal to prepare to establish diplomatic and trade relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as the invitation to Chancellor Adenauer to come to Moscow for talks, also promote the aforementioned goals, and there can be no doubt about this.

    In this connection, it should be recalled that good relations have been established between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic from the very beginning, and on the basis of these relations, cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields is developing more and more effectively.

    Negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan on normalizing relations between the two countries have also begun in London.

    In the second half of July, a meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France will be held. If all the participants in the meeting truly hope to ease international tensions, resolve pressing issues, and consolidate peace, this meeting will be of great significance.

    As for the United Nations, it should be recognized that it has occupied a certain important position in international affairs, and its activities have their positive aspects. The discussions conducted by the United Nations organization on a number of international issues related to maintaining peace and security have promoted the mobilization of public opinion to fight against the threat of new wars and to ease international tensions. The important significance of the resolution adopted in 1946 on the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and reducing armaments, as well as the resolution adopted in 1947 on the issue of prohibiting war propaganda, must be especially pointed out. Everyone also knows that the United Nations General Assembly expressed unanimous agreement on the tasks of the Disarmament Commission in 1954.

    While mentioning some of the positive aspects of the work of the United Nations, it should also be acknowledged that the current far from satisfactory situation is intolerable. In any case, the United Nations must neither become a passive recorder of international events, nor become a tool of any group to be used to achieve that group's selfish purposes.

    The United Nations organization should attach great importance to guaranteeing the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion. Everyone knows that it is guided in this regard by the following most important principles: the equality and self-determination of all countries; international cooperation and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries; resolving international disputes by peaceful means; and not using the threat of force in international affairs. These principles have been recognized by all member states of the United Nations, and they are the best foundation for the struggle for peace and international security, as well as for the struggle to develop international cooperation.

    All of this shows that the principles of coexistence and peaceful cooperation between countries with different social and economic systems have indeed been recognized in the United Nations Charter. At the same time, it is also clear that such coexistence is inextricably linked to the tasks of strengthening mutual trust between nations, stopping the "Cold War," stopping the expansion of armaments, and broadly developing international economic cooperation.

    Not only that, no one can deny that if the principle of coexistence and joint resolution of international problems by countries with different social systems is not recognized and implemented, the United Nations would become unimaginable. The provisions in the United Nations Charter regarding the Security Council clearly illustrate this point.

    It should also be recalled that the provision in the United Nations Charter that the Security Council must adhere to the principle of unanimity among the five major powers when resolving important issues related to guaranteeing international security was adopted based on the motion of the United States government. The United States government first put forward this proposal, which increased its reputation, on July 18, 1944, at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference of the representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain.

    However, even those who verbally acknowledge the principle of peaceful coexistence frequently violate this principle crudely in practice.

    The situation in China can be taken as an example.

    Until now, the indisputable right of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations has not been restored. No matter how one explains this abnormal situation, the real reason for the violation of China's rights is clear to everyone. It is only because the people's democratic revolution has been victorious in China, only because the great Chinese people have embarked on the road of building socialism, that the People's Republic of China is still being deprived of the right to occupy its legitimate position in the United Nations. This situation is obviously unjust and illegal.

    This illegal behavior can no longer be tolerated, otherwise everyone's trust in the United Nations will be undermined. The People's Republic of China should be given full opportunity to send representatives to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council without delay. It would be wrong to forget that this is a country with a population of 600 million, to forget that one out of every four people in the world is Chinese.

    Nor can we ignore the dangerous situation currently developing in the Taiwan Island and coastal islands area of China in the Far East. Everyone is very clear that Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands of China have historically been territories belonging to China. Many international agreements have also recognized this point. The United Nations should not tolerate the fact that this inalienable part of Chinese territory has not yet been returned to China, and it has a responsibility to take corresponding measures to resolve this important issue expeditiously.

    Not long ago, an important international conference was held in Bandung at the initiative of several Asian countries. Twenty-nine Asian and African countries participated in this conference. Although the participating countries had different social and national systems, this fact did not prevent them from working harmoniously. All the decisions of the Bandung Conference were adopted unanimously. The purpose of these decisions was to consolidate peace and friendship between the peoples of all countries, to guarantee their freedom and independence, and to intensify the struggle against colonialism.

    All of this is in line with the interests of all peace-loving countries. It cannot be pointed out here that the participation of countries such as India and Indonesia in this conference has great positive significance. The significance of the participation of the People's Republic of China in this conference is something that everyone remembers.

    In Bandung, the principle of peaceful coexistence was once again fully affirmed. This was not only beneficial to the participants of the conference, but also to the peoples of other countries, as well as to the entire cause of peace.

    Needless to say, the problem is not merely one of verbally acknowledging the principle of coexistence and peaceful cooperation between countries with different social systems. In our era, there is hardly anyone who dares to openly deny this principle. Warmongers are not respected and are unpopular!

    Today, we are all concerned not merely with acknowledging or declaring this or that principle, but we are concerned with concrete actions that will help to maintain and consolidate international peace and security.

    In this regard, the important significance of the well-known Soviet proposal on establishing a collective security system in Europe must be mentioned. The purpose of the Soviet draft on this issue is to guarantee the peace and security of all European countries (regardless of their social systems), with the participation of the United States. This shows that this draft has a fundamental difference from the exclusive military alliances that have been established in recent years, which violate the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and further exacerbate international tensions. The aforementioned proposal of the Soviet government embodies the essence of the Soviet peaceful diplomatic policy, which aims to establish collective security rather than to form mutually hostile military blocs.

    The Soviet government's proposals submitted to the London Disarmament Subcommittee on May 10 regarding the issues of reducing armaments, prohibiting atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of new wars should also be viewed from the same perspective.

    Everyone knows that the end of the bloodshed in Korea and Indochina not long ago, thanks to the efforts of the peace-loving peoples of various countries, has greatly helped to create favorable conditions for resolving other international disputes. However, it cannot be forgotten that situations that cause serious unease to the peoples of various countries still exist in certain regions of Europe and Asia. The main obstacle hindering the resolution of outstanding international issues is the lack of necessary trust between nations. This primarily refers to the relations between the major powers that bear the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and international security.

    In recent years, the world has been in a state of so-called cold war, and the burden of war preparations in some countries has weighed more and more heavily on the people. Only by ending the state of cold war between countries can international tensions be eased, the necessary trust in international relations be established, the threat of new wars be eliminated, and conditions be created that allow the peoples of various countries to live in peace and tranquility. This will provide the necessary opportunity to implement a broad disarmament plan and to establish corresponding international supervision for the implementation of this plan.

    All of this means that it is necessary to move from words to actions, to take steps that can restore the necessary trust between nations.

    Here, the following points should be done first: implement the well-known United Nations General Assembly resolution on stopping war propaganda in various countries; major powers should reach an agreement on abolishing military bases in the territories of other countries; promote the peaceful use of atomic energy and provide broad production, scientific, and technological assistance to countries that are technologically less advanced; the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France should reach a unanimous decision stipulating the withdrawal of their troops from Germany, temporarily leaving a small number of troops aside, and establishing local police forces with strictly limited numbers in both parts of Germany; resolve the outstanding issues in the Far East in accordance with the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity; eliminate all discrimination that hinders broad economic cooperation and the development of international trade; and expand international cultural ties by broadly exchanging delegations and developing travel.

    If progress is made in completing these important and urgent tasks, we will greatly promote the establishment of an atmosphere of trust between nations, thereby creating conditions for implementing a universal disarmament program, completely prohibiting atomic weapons, and establishing effective international supervision over the implementation of these resolutions.

    The Soviet proposals elaborate on this plan, and the aim of the proposals is to gradually implement the relevant measures in two phases: Phase One – measures to be implemented during 1956; Phase Two – measures to be implemented during 1957.

    The essence of these measures can be seen from the following. First is about conventional armaments.

    The Soviet draft of May 10 included all the proposals of the United States, Great Britain, France, and Canada regarding the reduction of conventional armaments, without making any changes. This would mean that the five major powers must reduce the number of their armed forces within two years, so that they do not exceed the following levels:

    United States: 1 million to 1.5 million people.

    Soviet Union: 1 million to 1.5 million people.

    China: 1 million to 1.5 million people.

    Great Britain: No more than 650,000 people.

    France: No more than 650,000 people.

    In addition to this, the Soviet Union proposed that a world conference on universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons be convened before the first half of 1956. It was proposed that the number of armed forces in other countries be stipulated to be far lower than the levels of the five permanent members of the Security Council.

    In terms of conventional armaments, everything we have proposed has not exceeded the scope of the proposals of Western countries. In this way, it can no longer be said that the conventional armaments of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries will have some special advantage compared to other countries. This objection should be dispelled.

    Now it depends on what the United States and other Western countries do. Since the Soviet Union has fully accepted their proposals regarding conventional armaments, then the Western countries have no reason to delay the resolution of the issue of atomic weapons any longer. They should agree not to use atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and agree to completely prohibit these weapons, as has already been proposed in the Soviet draft (applause).

    Taking such steps by both sides would be tantamount to promoting the easing of the international situation in fact and to promoting the consolidation of universal peace in fact.

    The Soviet government has also approached the opinions of Western countries on the issue of atomic weapons. The Soviet government has agreed to their proposal that before atomic weapons are completely prohibited, all countries have the right to use such weapons to defend against aggression, but with one condition: that in this special case, the Security Council must make a certain decision on this before they can be used. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that all countries must undertake the following solemn obligation: not to use nuclear weapons and to consider such weapons to be prohibited weapons. The Soviet Union is prepared to undertake this solemn obligation, if other countries that possess atomic weapons do so as well. Therefore, in this regard, the problem is now not with the Soviet Union, but with other countries.

    The Soviet government's proposals of May 10 not only include new proposals on universal disarmament, prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, and eliminating the threat of new wars, but also stipulate concrete measures for establishing effective international supervision over the implementation of the corresponding resolutions.

    According to our proposal, for this purpose, monitoring stations should be established on the basis of mutual principles in all major ports, railway hubs, highways, and airports of all relevant countries. These monitoring stations should be established by international supervisory bodies, and they will be responsible for monitoring and preventing dangerous concentrations of naval, land, and air forces, so as to prevent one country from attacking another. In addition, the international supervisory bodies should establish regular inspection agencies. These inspection agencies should have their own inspectors in all the signatory countries of this convention, who have the right to inspect all supervisory targets at any time without restrictions.

    Such are the basic proposals of the Soviet Union regarding the issues of reducing armaments, prohibiting atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of new wars. Naturally, the People's Republic of China should also participate in the discussion of all these issues (applause).

    The Soviet government hopes that the governments of other countries will also quickly express their opinions on all these issues.

    Here, in San Francisco, we are among the American people. As a representative of the Soviet Union, I would like to especially express the Soviet people's goodwill feelings towards the American people (applause).

    Everyone will agree that in order to make peace and security more reliable and more lasting, so that the confidence and tranquility of the whole world can be guaranteed for a long time, this largely depends on the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States (applause). This is what the Soviet people hope for, and they believe that this is also the desire of the American people (applause).

    The existing differences between the governments of various countries can be resolved, and the current distrust between countries can and must be eliminated, as long as the Soviet people and the American people take on this responsibility, do not neglect the difficulties of this work, and resolutely defend peace and their own national interests in accordance with the principles of the United Nations.

    We are entering the second decade since the establishment of the United Nations. Today, its main task, which is more urgent than ever before, is to guarantee peace and prevent new wars. Guaranteeing the peaceful and tranquil life of the peoples of various countries, this is the noble and grateful task of the United Nations.

    No matter how justified the criticisms of the work of the United Nations in the past, especially of the steps it has taken when there have been sharp conflicts in the international community, we have no reason to underestimate its existence and the important significance of its continued work for peace and international security in the future. If all of us, the member states of this international organization that bears extremely important responsibilities, strive to make the work of the United Nations as consistent as possible with its great purposes and principles, this organization is capable of and will definitely greatly improve its work and carry out its work more actively and effectively.

    It should be acknowledged that the experience of the first decade fully proves the justice and progressive nature of the international principles on which the United Nations was established. These principles should continue to be the unshakable foundation of its work.

    It is also no accident that these principles have been embodied to some extent in many international documents, including documents that are not directly related to the United Nations. For example, this is the case with the famous Five Principles that were put forward last year as the basis of the joint statement of the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China. The same can be said of the Ten Principles in the declaration of the Asian-African Conference and certain other international documents.

    The United Nations also faces certain new tasks.

    For example, the issue of convening a world economic conference to promote the development of international trade has matured. Only an authoritative international organization such as the United Nations can convene such a conference, which will be attended by both member states of the United Nations and countries that have not joined the United Nations.

    All of this proves that the work of this international organization and its practical measures should be improved in many ways. Naturally, the experience accumulated over these years will help to achieve this purpose. In this regard, it is even more important that people increasingly recognize the need to raise all the activities of the United Nations to a higher stage, so that they fully conform to the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations.

    The United Nations can and must play a huge role in the struggle to consolidate peace. The United Nations must do everything in its power to end the existing tensions in international relations and promote the establishment of necessary trust between nations. Doing so will be in line with the wishes of the people who are fighting for peace, for achieving peaceful and tranquil living conditions.

    We are entering a new decade. The United Nations' responsibility to the future of the peoples of various countries, to the peace and happiness of mankind, has never been so great. The recognition of this noble responsibility must be carried out in all actions of the United Nations.

    The Soviet Union fully recognizes the significance of the position of our socialist country in the United Nations.

    The Soviet Union is doing everything in its power to support all activities of the United Nations and to guarantee lasting peace and international security (applause).

### 在联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会上  莫洛托夫同志的演说

    在联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会上
    莫洛托夫同志的演说尊敬的主席！尊敬的代表们！
    首先，我愿意代表苏联代表团向旧金山市长罗宾逊先生在这个非常好的城市里给予我们的款待，表示衷心的感谢。
    今天我们在纪念和庆祝联合国十周年。这是一个重要的有历史意义的日子。
    这些天，世界各地亿万人将特别仔细地注意倾听这里所说的关于联合国过去时期的活动的一切言论。
    联合国是在第二次世界大战期间成立的。在奠定它的基础的当时，战争还在欧洲许多国家的领土上、在亚洲的广大地区、在大西洋和太平洋进行着，大多数人类违反着他们的意志，卷入了一个其规模和严重后果都是空前的战争中。
    在那个时候，著名的反希特勒联盟形成了，这个联盟是以苏联、美利坚合众国和英国为首的，它鼓舞了受到法西斯侵略者的进攻并且在经历着艰苦时日的各国人民的忘我的解放斗争。
    反希特勒联盟各国之间在战争过程中形成了良好友善的关系。迫在眉睫的遭受法西斯主义奴役的危险使这些国家接近起来。这还使它们团结起来建立联合国，以便在战争结束之后共同维护国际和平和安全。
    这个组织的基础是在由苏联、美国、英国和中国的代表一九四三年十月三十日在莫斯科签字的
  “四国关于普遍安全的宣言”中奠定的。这个工作是在旧金山这里完成的；在这里，联合国宪章在联合国第一次会议上经过谨慎仔细的审议之后，于一九四五年六月二十六日签订了。
    联合国宪章一开头就说，我联合国人民同兹决心，“欲免后世再遭今代人类两度身历惨不堪言之战祸”。“欲免后世再遭战祸”——这就是联合国根本的、最高的任务。各国人民没有比防止另一次世界大战更加重要的任务了。联合国没有比谋求和平、各国人民之间的友谊和合作更加崇高的目标了。
    我们大家都必须记住这一点，并且必须认识联合国所负的任务的重大意义。这是我们的神圣的责任。
    可是，我们决不能闭上眼睛不看事实。
    我们不能忽视现在在国际关系中存在着由于新战争宣传而不断加剧的相当严重的紧张局势。我们更不能无视这种紧张局势的进一步加剧危及和平的维持，并且造成新战争的危险。
    近年来，某些国家进行了史无前例的军备扩充，它给广大群众身上加上了沉重的军费负担。
    原子武器和氢武器被以愈来愈大的规模储存起来；鉴于这种情况的危险后果，它引起了各国人民理所当然的不安。
    在其他国家领土上，正在进行着大规模建筑军事基地的工作。这些基地距离建筑它们的国家的国境有几千公里远，从这一事实就可以看出，建立这些基地绝不是为了防御目的。
    但是，在自己身旁正在有人建筑这些基地的国家里，以及在自己的领土上有人正在建筑这些基地的国家里，人民难道能够安心吗？
    在欧洲，在亚洲以及世界其他地区，愈来愈多的军事集团和联盟正在建立起来。近来还有人力图以一切可能的手段把近东和中东的一些小国拖入这种军事联盟，虽然这样做是违反这些国家的人民的意志的。这些军事联盟显然是针对着某些国家的，这就说明了它们的帝国主义侵略性质。事情甚至达到了这种程度：竟然缔结了一些使西德得以重新军国主义化和参加大家都知道属于侵略性质的军事联盟的协定。这种集团和联盟又转而必然促使对方也组织防御联盟。
    如果最近已经变成了危险的原子战争宣传的新战争宣传，在某些国家继续毫无阻碍地进行下去，如果军备扩充和不是为了防御而是为了进攻其他国家才建立的上述军事基地的建筑继续加紧起来，如果为了这些目的有更多针对其他国家的军事联盟继续拼凑起来，那么，国际紧张局势将更形加剧。遵循这条道路，就意味着急速地向第三次世界大战迈进。
    全世界人民都不希望有新的战争，他们将严厉地谴责进攻的一方，也就是那些将发动另一次世界大战的人，难道可以不考虑到这样的事实吗？全世界人民为了防止新战争和全力反对帝国主义侵略势力想发动另一次世界大战的任何企图的运动，日益壮大，这不是证明了这一点吗？没有疑问，在这种情况之下——当然，还要有爱好和平国家的适当的自卫准备——发动新战争的进攻一方将被有力地谴责为侵略者，并且将在全世界人民眼中处于道义上和政治上完全孤立的地位，而这就将预先决定它的必然失败。
    另外一方面，我们不能不看到我们今天有足够的事实可以证明现在存在着可以导致持久和平和巩固各国友谊的已经考验过的途径。
    这些事实中有几件是应当谈一谈的。
    朝鲜战争由于爱好和平国家的创议而告结束以来，已有两年了。朝鲜的停战使朝鲜问题的和平解决成为可能。现在应该帮助南、北朝鲜人民来恢复他们国家的统一，这是符合朝鲜人民的愿望的。
    去年的日内瓦会议在大体上符合印度支那人民要求民族解放的愿望的情况下，结束了印度支那的战争。日内瓦协定的意义可以从亚洲人赞同它这一事实中清楚地看出来。日内瓦协定在欧洲和世界其他地方也得到了正确的了解。
    大约在一个月以前，奥地利国家条约缔结了。大家商定奥地利将不允许外国在它的领土上建立军事基地，它将不参加军事集团，并将成为像瑞士那样的中立国。苏联在这方面所表现的主动得到了其他有关国家、特别重要的是得到奥地利本身的必要的支持。结果，谈判使得欧洲又一个重要的国际问题得到了解决。
    最近期间的一个极其重要事件，是苏联政府代表团在贝尔格莱德访问期间，苏联和南斯拉夫之间的关系得到了调整。由于苏南谈判的结果而使两国的关系得到的改善，是符合苏联和南斯拉夫人民的深切愿望和根本利益的。这个事实同时大大有助于欧洲政治紧张局势的缓和，并且符合巩固普遍和平的需要。
    在这一方面，有必要指出，西方有人为了要歪曲贝尔格莱德会谈以及会谈结果的意义和缩小其重要性而进行的各种造谣是毫无根据的。应当着重指出，苏南两国达成的联合宣言中所表明的关于改进和发展两国友好关系的协议，并不是出于某种暂时的考虑，而是由于意识到这种关系对苏联和南斯拉夫、对缓和国际紧张局势和建立国与国之间必要的信任具有重大的意义。
    特别值得注意的是印度总理尼赫鲁先生访问苏联。这次访问对进一步巩固苏联同印度的友好关系，对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平具有重大的意义。
    我刚才列举的一些事实和其他的许多事实都证明了，苏联和其他爱好和平的国家执行的缓和国际紧张局势的政策，不断地产生着积极的结果。
    苏联政府关于准备同德意志联邦共和国建立外交和贸易关系的建议，以及请阿登纳总理到莫斯科进行会谈的邀请，也促进了上述那些目标，这一点是不能有所怀疑的。
    在这一点上，应当回顾一下，苏联和德意志民主共和国之间从一开始就建立了良好的关系，在这种关系的基础上，两国的政治、经济和文化方面的合作愈来愈有成效地在发展着。
    苏联和日本关于使两国关系正常化的谈判也已经在伦敦开始。
    在七月下半月，将要举行苏联、美国、英国和法国四国政府首脑会议。如果会议的所有的参加者都真正希望缓和国际紧张局势、解决迫切的问题和巩固和平，这次会议将具有巨大的意义。
    至于联合国，应当承认，它在国际事务中占有过一定的重要地位，它的活动有其积极的方面。联合国组织就同维护和平和安全有关的一些国际问题进行的讨论，曾促使舆论动员起来，为反对新战争威胁和缓和国际紧张局势而斗争。必须特别指出一九四六年通过的关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备问题的决议以及一九四七年通过的关于禁止战争宣传的决议的重要意义。大家还知道，一九五四年联合国大会就裁军委员会的任务问题表示了一致的意见。
    在提到联合国工作中的积极的一些方面时，同时也应该承认，目前远远不能令人满意的状况是不能容忍的。无论如何，联合国必须既不要成为国际事件的被动记录者，也不要成为随便哪一个集团的工具，被利用来达到这个集团的自私目的。
    联合国组织要十分重视不分种族、性别、言语和宗教的不同而保障一切人的人权和基本自由，大家知道，它在这方面是以下述几条最主要的原则为指针：各国平等和自决；国际合作和不干涉他国内政；以和平方法解决国际争端；在国际事务中不使用武力威胁。这些原则得到联合国全体会员国的承认，它们是争取和平和国际安全的斗争以及争取发展国际合作的斗争的最好基础。
    这一切都说明，联合国宪章内已经确实地承认了各种社会和经济制度的国家共处以及和平合作的原则。同时也很清楚，这样的共处是同加强国际间相互信任、停止“冷战”、停止扩张军备和广泛发展国际经济合作等任务不可分割地联系在一起的。
    不仅如此，谁也不能否认，如果不承认和不实行各种不同社会制度的国家共处和共同解决国际问题的原则，联合国便成为不可想像的了。联合国宪章中关于安全理事会的规定便清楚地说明了这一点。
    还应该追述一下，联合国宪章中关于安全理事会在解决有关保障国际安全的重要问题时必须遵守五大国一致的原则的规定，是根据美国政府的动议通过的。美国政府第一次提出这一个增加了它的声誉的建议是在一九四四年七月十八日苏、美、英三国代表敦巴顿橡树会议上。
    但是，甚至那些口头上承认和平共处原则的人却不时在实际上粗暴地破坏这个原则。
    这可以以中国的情形为例。
    直到现在，中华人民共和国在联合国中的不容争辩的权利仍未得到恢复。无论对这种不正常的情况作怎样的解释，中国的权利遭到破坏的真正原因是大家都清楚的。只是因为人民民主革命在中国获得了胜利，只是因为伟大的中国人民走上了建设社会主义的道路，中华人民共和国才仍然被剥夺了在联合国中占有它的合法地位的权利。这种情况显然是不公正的和非法的。
    这种非法的行为再也不能容忍了，否则就要使大家对联合国的信任遭到破坏。应当刻不容缓地给予中华人民共和国派代表到联合国大会和安全理事会的充分机会。如果忘记了这是个拥有六亿人口的国家，如果忘记了全世界每四个人中就有一个中国人，那是错误的。
    也不能忽视目前在台湾岛和中国沿海岛屿地区形成的远东危险局势。大家都很清楚，台湾、澎湖以及中国沿海岛屿都是历来就属于中国的领土。许多国际协定也都承认了这一点。联合国不应当容忍中国领土的这一不可分割的部分迄今还没有归还中国这种情况，并且有责任采取相应的措施来从速解决这个重要问题。
    不久以前，根据几个亚洲国家的倡议，在万隆举行了一个重要的国际会议。有二十九个亚洲和非洲的国家参加了这个会议。虽然与会各国的社会和国家制度是各不相同的，但这个事实并没有妨碍它们协调地进行工作。万隆会议的一切决定都是一致通过的。这些决定的目的是要巩固和平和各国人民之间的友谊，保障它们的自由和独立，加紧同殖民主义进行斗争。
    这一切都是符合所有爱好和平的国家的利益的。这里不能不指出，像印度、印度尼西亚等国家参加这次会议具有重大的积极的意义。中华人民共和国参加这次会议的意义是大家都记得的。
    在万隆，和平共处的原则又一次得到了充分的肯定。这不仅对会议的参加者是有益的，连其他各国人民以及整个和平事业也都得到了好处。
    不用说，问题决不仅仅是口头上承认不同社会制度的国家的共处和和平合作的原则。在我们的时代，几乎没有一个人胆敢公开否认这个原则。战争贩子是不受尊敬的，是不得人心的！
    今天我们大家关心的不是仅仅承认或宣布这一个或另一个原则，我们关心的是会有助于维护和巩固国际和平和安全的具体行动。
    在这方面，必须提到众所周知的苏联关于在欧洲建立一个集体安全体系的建议的重要意义。关于这个问题的苏联草案的目的是，保障所有欧洲国家（不管它们的社会制度如何）的和平和安全，有美国参加。这表明了这个草案同最近几年成立的、违反联合国宪章的基本原则和进一步加剧国际紧张局势的、排他的军事联盟有着根本上的不同。苏联政府的上述建议体现了旨在建立集体安全而不是成立互相敌对的军事集团的苏联和平外交政策的本质。
    苏联政府在五月十日提交给伦敦裁军小组委员会的、关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议，也应该从同一个角度来看。
    大家知道，不久前由于爱好和平的各国人民的努力，朝鲜和印度支那的流血结束了，这就在很大程度上有助于创造解决其他国际争端的有利条件。但是，不能忘记，在欧洲和亚洲某些地区仍然存在着使各国人民严重不安的局势。阻碍悬而未决的国际问题得到解决的主要障碍是国际间缺乏必要的信任。这首先指对维护和平和国际安全负有主要责任的各大国之间的关系。
    在最近几年中，世界一直处在一种所谓冷战的状态，一些国家的战争准备负担越来越沉重地压在人民身上。只有结束各国间的冷战状态才能促进国际紧张局势的缓和，建立国际关系中的必要的信任，消除新战争的威胁和创造使各国人民能够在和平和宁静中生活的条件。这将为实施广泛的裁军计划并对这种计划的实行建立相应的国际监督提供必要的机会。
    所有这一切都意味着，必须从言论进而采取行动，采取能恢复国际间必要信任的步骤。
    这里，首先应该做到下列各点：执行人所共知的联合国大会关于制止在各国进行战争宣传的决议；大国间获致关于取消在别国领土上的军事基地的协议；促进原子能的和平用途、对技术上比较落后的国家提供广泛的生产、科学和技术上的援助；苏联、美国、英国和法国达成意见一致的决定，规定把它们的军队从德国撤退，暂时留下人数不多的部队除外，在德国两部分建立人数受严格限制的地方警察部队；根据主权和领土完整的原则解决远东的悬而未决的问题；消除阻碍广泛的经济合作和国际贸易发展的一切歧视；通过广泛地互派代表团和发展旅行来扩大国际文化联系。
    如果在完成这些重要的和迫切的任务方面取得进展，我们就将大大促进国际间的信任气氛的建立，从而将为实行一个普遍裁减军备、完全禁止原子武器和对这些决议的执行建立有效的国际监督的计划创造条件。
    苏联的建议阐述了这个计划，建议的目的是要在两个时期中逐步实行有关的措施：第一时期——在一九五六年期间实行的措施；第二时期——在一九五七年期间实行的措施。
    这些措施的实质可以由以下所述看出。首先是关于常规军备。
    五月十日的苏联草案包括了美国、英国、法国和加拿大关于裁减常规军备的一切建议，未作任何改变。这将意味着五大国必须在两年之内裁减武装部队的人数，使它们不超过以下水平：
    美国：一百万到一百五十万人。
    苏联：一百万到一百五十万人。
    中国：一百万到一百五十万人。
    英国：不超过六十五万人。
    法国：不超过六十五万人。
    除此以外，苏联建议，在一九五六年上半年以前，召开世界普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器会议。建议把其他国家武装部队的人数规定得大大低于安全理事会五个常任理事国的水平。
    在常规军备方面，我们所建议的这一切都未超出西方国家建议的范围。这样一来，总不能再说苏联、中国和其他国家的常规军备同其他国家比较将占有某些特别的优势了吧，这种反对意见应当打消了。
    现在就看美国和其他西方国家怎样了。既然苏联已经完全接受了它们的关于常规军备的建议，那末西方国家就没有理由再拖延原子武器问题的解决了，它们应当同意不使用原子武器和氢武器，同意完全禁止这种武器，像苏联草案中已经建议的那样
  （掌声）。
    双方采取这样的步骤，就等于用事实来促进国际局势的缓和，用事实来促进普遍和平的巩固。
    苏联政府在原子武器问题上也接近了西方国家的意见。苏联政府同意了它们的建议，即在完全禁止原子武器以前，各国有权使用这种武器来防御侵略，但有一个条件：在这种特殊的情况下，要有安全理事会对此作出一定的决定后才能使用。同时，苏联政府认为，各国必须承担下列庄严的义务：不使用核子武器并认为这种武器是被禁止的武器。苏联准备承担这种庄严的义务，如果其他掌握有原子武器的国家也这样做的话。因此，在这方面，现在问题也不在苏联身上，而是在其他国家身上。
    苏联政府五月十日的建议不仅包括有关于普遍裁军、禁止原子武器和氢武器的新建议，而且规定了对相应的决议的实施建立有效的国际监督的具体办法。
    根据我们的建议，为此，应当根据相互的原则在所有有关国家的各大港口、铁路枢纽、公路线和飞机场建立监察所。这些监察所应当由国际监督机构来建立，它们负责监视不让海、陆、空军进行危险的集中，以防止一个国家进攻另一个国家。此外，国际监督机构应当设立经常性的检查机构。这种检查机构，应当在这种公约的一切签字国内设有自己的检查人员，他们有权在任何时候不受限制地视察所有监督对象。
    苏联关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的问题的基本建议就是这样。自然，在讨论这一切问题时，中华人民共和国也是应当参加的（掌声）。
    苏联政府期望，其他国家政府也将迅速对所有这些问题表示自己的意见。
    在这里，在旧金山，我们处在美国人民中间。作为苏联的代表，我想特别表示苏联人民对美国人民的善意感情（掌声）。
    大家都会同意：要使和平和安全变得更加可靠、更加持久，从而使全世界的信心和安宁得到长期的保障，这在很大程度上决定于苏联和美国人民（掌声）。这就是苏联人民所希望的，而且他们相信，这也是美国人民的愿望（掌声）。
    各国政府之间现有的分歧是可以解决的，目前各国之间的不信任是可以而且必须消除的，只要苏联人和美国人都负担起这个责任来，不忽视这件工作的困难，而坚决根据联合国原则来保卫和平和自己的民族利益。
    我们正在进入联合国建立以来的第二个十年。今天，它的比过去任何时候都更加迫切的主要任务是保障和平，防止新的战争。保障各国人民的和平和安宁的生活，这便是联合国的崇高的令人感激的任务。
    对联合国过去时期的工作，特别对它在国际上存在尖锐的冲突时采取的一些步骤进行的批评，尽管是多么公正，但是，我们没有理由来低估它的存在和它今后为和平和国际安全而继续工作的重要意义。如果我们大家，这一负有极其重大的责任的国际组织的会员国，努力使联合国的工作尽量符合于它的伟大的宗旨和原则的话，这一组织是能够而且必定会大大改善它的工作，更加积极和有效地进行工作的。
    应当承认，头十年的经验完全证明了联合国所赖以建立的国际原则的正义性和进步性。这些原则应当继续成为它的工作的不可动摇的基础。
    这些原则在许多国际文件中，其中包括在同联合国没有直接关系的文件中，都得到了某种体现，这也不是偶然的。例如，去年被提出来作为印度共和国和中华人民共和国的联合声明的基础的著名的五项原则就是这样。关于亚非会议宣言中的十项原则和其他某些国际文件也可以这样说。
    联合国也面临某些新任务。
    例如，关于召开一次世界经济会议来促进国际贸易的发展的问题已经成熟了。只有联合国这样权威性的国际组织才能召开这样一个既有联合国会员国也有没有参加联合国的国家参加的会议。
    这一切证明，这个国际组织的工作和它的实际措施在许多方面应该加以改进。自然，在这些年来积累的经验将帮助达到这种目的。在这方面，更重要的是人们越来越认识到必须把联合国所有的活动提到更高的阶段，以使它们充分符合于联合国的崇高宗旨和原则。
    联合国能够而且必须在争取巩固和平的斗争中起巨大的作用。联合国必须竭尽全力来结束国际关系中现有的紧张局势和促进国际间的必要的信任的建立，这样做将符合于为和平、为取得过安宁和和平的生活条件而斗争的人民的愿望。
    我们将进入一个新的十年。联合国对各国人民的前途、对人类的和平和幸福的责任从来没有这样重大过。对这一崇高责任的认识必须贯彻到联合国的一切行动中。
    苏联充分认识到我们社会主义国家在联合国中的地位的意义。
      苏联正在尽它的一切力量来支持联合国的一切活动，保证持久和平和国际安全（掌声）。
