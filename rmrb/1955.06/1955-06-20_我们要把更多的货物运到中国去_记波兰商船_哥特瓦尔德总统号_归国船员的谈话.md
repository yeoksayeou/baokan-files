    "We Want to Ship More Goods to China"
    On the Conversation of Returning Crew Members of the Polish Merchant Ship "President Gottwald"
    Xie Wenqing
    On the afternoon of the 26th, red flags fluttered and colorful tents were erected at the airport in Gdansk. On the roads leading to the airport from the cities of Gdansk and Gdynia, cars and trolleybuses, one after another, were filled with welcoming people heading to the airport. Some of the girls wore festive national costumes, and representatives of the Gottwald coal mine wore miners' formal attire. People held flowers and sang loudly on the speeding vehicles.
    The summer sea breeze swept across the azure Baltic Sea, and white waves rolled toward the coast. Nearly 40,000 people gathered at the airport, waiting eagerly for the return of the heroic sailors. The families of the returning sailors stood at the forefront.
    A twin-engine silver plane appeared in the clear sky above the Baltic Sea. People waved flowers and handkerchiefs, cheering the plane. The plane repeatedly wagged its wings, as if saluting the welcomers. The red and white Polish flag on the tail of the plane appeared particularly solemn and bright in the sunlight. As soon as the plane landed, people surrounded it from all directions. As the door opened, bouquets of flowers were thrown to the heroic sailors who had just emerged. The sailors walked onto the rostrum amidst the embraces of the people. The rostrum was decorated with the flags of Poland, the Soviet Union, China, and Sweden (two representatives of the Swedish Red Cross accompanied the sailors from Taiwan to Gdansk). A large slogan read: "The people of the motherland welcome their heroic sailors!" The Vice Chairman of the Gdansk People's Council Executive Committee, Grigoriev, delivered a welcome speech. Captain Semiot (formerly translated as Semoit) and Deputy Captain Nawrot (formerly translated as Navkot) spoke to the crowd that welcomed them.
    On the 27th, the returning sailors of the "President Gottwald" recounted their painful experiences and heroic struggles in Taiwan:
    On May 13, 1954, the Polish merchant ship "President Gottwald" was en route to China when it was first monitored by American aircraft in international waters in the Taiwan Strait, followed by Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships sent a signal demanding that the "President Gottwald" follow it, but the captain of the "President Gottwald" refused. Thereupon, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships fired on the "President Gottwald" twice in succession, forcing it to enter the port of Kaohsiung. After entering the port, the sailors were forced to leave the merchant ship and stay in a store. After illegally detaining the merchant ship, the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits also attempted to abduct the Polish sailors to the United States. They tried every possible means to make the Polish sailors betray their country and sign so-called "requests for political asylum." First, there was material temptation. During the three months of staying in the store, the sailors were able to obtain relatively abundant food. Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, under the instructions of American "officers," often went to "talk" with the sailors and "introduce" prostitutes. The agents said that if they signed the "request for political asylum," they could get a good job in the United States, get two hundred dollars a month, and travel to any country they wanted. However, the patriotic Polish sailors could not be bought with dollars and women. Their demands were very firm: they only wanted to return to their Polish motherland, and told the agents: "From now on, we will not discuss anything other than the issue of restoring freedom and returning to Poland."
    Dollars and women could not move the sailors' hearts, so the agents resorted to deception. The sailors were divided into two groups and separated. Deputy Captain Nawrot and the secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party branch on the "President Gottwald," Budnaruk, were both isolated separately. After blocking all news sources and cutting off all contact between the sailors and the outside world, the agents deceived sailor A by saying that sailor B had already signed the "request for political asylum," and deceived B by saying that A had signed it. The agents also confiscated all the sailors' family letters and spread rumors that the sailors' families had lost their freedom. But the patriotic Polish sailors were not fooled either. They insisted on returning to their country and collectively went on a hunger strike to protest their illegal detention.
    Unable to deceive them, the agents began to intimidate and abuse them. Starting last summer, the sailors were moved from the store to two dilapidated and leaky wooden houses. Daily food was insufficient, and the sailors had to sell their luggage at low prices to buy some food. However, because much of the luggage had been looted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, there were few items left to sell. Sailors who fell ill due to hunger and dampness did not receive medical treatment. But abuse could not shake the sailors' patriotic will. The sailors transmitted notes through local residents, agreeing to launch a joint hunger strike. Some sailors had a total of seven or eight hunger strikes, not eating anything for more than twenty days in total, and in September last year, they all went on a hunger strike together for four days.
    Nietkovski was the only one among the returning sailors who could speak English. He was present at all negotiations and contacts during his stay in Taiwan, so he had the opportunity to contact local residents. He said that in the sailors' struggle, the Taiwanese residents gave them a lot of encouragement and help. The letters the sailors wrote to the International Committee of the Red Cross were forwarded by local residents to British sailors. Some residents also constantly sent tea and cigarettes to the sailors, and encouraged them to say: as long as you persevere to the end, you can regain your freedom.
    After more than a year of unyielding and heroic struggle, with the continuous efforts of the Polish government and people to rescue them, the captain, deputy captain, and seventeen other sailors of the "President Gottwald" finally victoriously returned to their beloved Polish motherland (another person remained abroad for treatment due to illness). To commend the returning sailors for their loyalty to the motherland and heroic struggle, the Polish government awarded the Second Class Labor Banner Medal to Deputy Captain Nawrot and five others, the Officer's Cross of the Polish Revival Order to Captain Semiot and five others, and the "Golden Cross Medal" to Deck Assistant Nietkovski and seven others on May 29. The 24-year-old Deputy Captain specifically entrusted the reporter to convey the words of the returning sailors to the Chinese people: "The American-Chiang Kai-shek pirates can never stop maritime traffic between China and Poland. We want to ship more goods to China to support the Chinese people in building socialism!" (Warsaw News Agency)

    “我们要把更多的货物运到中国去”
    记波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德总统号”归国船员的谈话
    谢文清
    二十六日下午，在革但斯克的机场上飘起了红旗，扎起了彩棚。在从革但斯克、琴尼亚两城通往飞机场的马路上，一辆接着一辆的大小汽车和无轨电车载满了欢迎的人们向飞机场开去。有的女孩子们穿着节日的民族服装，哥特瓦尔德煤矿的矿工代表穿着矿工礼服，人们手执鲜花在飞奔的车辆上高声歌唱。
    夏季的海风掠过蔚蓝的波罗的海，海面上卷起一片片雪白的浪花朝着海岸涌来，集合在飞机场上的近四万人都怀着殷切的心情在等候英勇海员的归来。归国海员的家属们站在最前列。
    一架双引擎的银白色飞机在波罗的海晴朗的上空出现了。人们挥舞着鲜花和手帕，向飞机欢呼起来。飞机连连摇动着翅膀，好像在向欢迎者示礼，机尾上的红白二色的波兰国旗在阳光照耀中显得格外庄严、明朗。飞机一着陆，人们就从四面八方把它包围起来。机门开处，一束束的鲜花就投向那刚刚探出身来的英勇海员们。海员们在人们的拥抱中走上了主席台。台上挂着波兰、苏联、中国和瑞典（瑞典红十字会两个代表从台湾陪同海员们来到革但斯克）四国国旗，大字标语上写着：“祖国人民欢迎自己英勇的海员！”革但斯克人民会议执行委员会副主席哥列哥列克致欢迎词，船长塞米奥特（前译塞莫伊特）和副船长纳夫罗特（前译纳夫科特）向欢迎他们的群众讲了话。
    二十七日，“哥特瓦尔德总统号”的归国海员们叙述了他们在台湾的痛苦遭遇和英勇斗争的经过：
    一九五四年五月十三日波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德总统号”在开往中国途中，在台湾海峡的公海上首先受到了美国飞机的监视，接着就来了蒋贼炮舰。蒋贼炮舰上发出信号要“哥特瓦尔德总统号”随它开行，但被“哥特瓦尔德总统号”船长拒绝。于是，蒋贼炮舰就连续两次向“哥特瓦尔德总统号”开火射击，强迫它开进高雄港。进港后，海员们就被迫离开商船在一家商店中住下。美蒋匪帮非法扣留商船后，还企图把波兰海员劫运到美国去。他们千方百计地想使波兰海员背叛祖国，在什么“要求政治庇护书”上签字。首先是物质引诱，在商店住的三个月中，海员们能得到比较充裕的食物，蒋贼特务们在美国“军官”的指示下，常去同海员们“谈话”，并“介绍”妓女。特务们说，假如在“要求政治庇护书”上签了名，就可以在美国得到很好的职业，每月可拿到两百美元，并且随便到哪一国旅行都可以。但是，热爱祖国的波兰海员们不是美元和女色所能收买的，他们的要求很坚定：只愿回到波兰祖国，并告诉特务们：“今后除恢复自由，返回波兰的问题外，其它事情一概不谈。”
    美元和女色打不动海员们的心，特务们就改用欺骗手法。海员们被分成两组隔离开了，副船长纳夫罗特和波兰统一工人党“哥特瓦尔德总统号”支部书记伯德纳鲁克两人都被单独隔离。封锁了一切新闻来源，断绝了海员们同外界的一切联系以后，特务们就欺骗船员甲说船员乙已在“要求政治庇护书”上签了字，又欺骗乙说甲已签了字。特务们还把海员们的家信全部没收，并造谣说海员的家庭已失去自由。但爱国的波兰海员们也不受骗，他们坚持要求回国，并集体举行绝食，抗议对他们的非法扣留。
    欺骗不了，特务们就开始了威吓和虐待。从去年夏天起，海员们就从商店被送到两所破烂漏雨的木屋中去。每天食品不足，海员们只得廉价变卖行李物件，来买点吃的。但因许多行李已被蒋贼军抢去，可变卖的物件已很少了。在饥饿和潮湿的折磨下患病的海员也得不到医药治疗。但虐待也不能动摇海员们的爱国意志。海员们通过当地居民传送字条，约定共同展开绝食斗争。有的海员共绝食了七、八次，先后有二十多天未吃东西，而在去年九月间，有一次大家一同绝食了四天。
    涅特科夫斯基是归国海员中唯一能说英语的人。在台湾期间一切交涉和联络他都在场，因此他有机会接触当地居民。他说在海员们的斗争中，台湾居民给了他们不少鼓励和帮助。海员们写给红十字国际委员会的信就是由当地居民转交英国海员发出的。有些居民还不断送些茶叶和香烟给海员们，并鼓励他们说：只要坚持到底，就能恢复自由。
    经过一年多不屈不挠的英勇斗争后，在波兰政府和人民不断努力营救下，“哥特瓦尔德总统号”的船长、副船长和其他十七名海员终于胜利地回到了他们心爱的波兰祖国（另一人因病留在国外治疗）。为了表彰归国海员对祖国的忠诚和英勇斗争，波兰政府在五月二十九日把二级劳动旗帜勋章授给副船长纳夫罗特等六人，把军官十字波兰复兴勋章授给船长塞米奥特等六人，又把“金十字勋章”授给甲板助理涅特科夫斯基等七人。二十四岁的副船长特地委托记者把归国海员们的话转达给中国人民：“美蒋海盗们决不能阻止中波间的海上交通，我们要把更多的货物运到中国去支援中国人民建设社会主义！”（华沙航讯）
