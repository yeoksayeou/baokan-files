How a School Saved Grain
    Li Huixin

    The North China Workers' Junior Middle School in Shijiazhuang has more than 1,100 students and faculty members, all of whom eat at the school. In the past, the monthly food expense settlement always resulted in a deficit, and the students complained that the food was not good and had many opinions.

    The food administrator was very anxious, but could not find the reason. Once, during the monthly settlement, he suddenly discovered that the staple food expenditure accounted for about 80% of the total food expense (the staple food expenditure of general canteens accounts for 50% to 60%), so he suggested checking the entire school for staple food waste. An inspection revealed that because the kitchen and dining hall had no regulations, students crowded and grabbed food when meals were served; although two steamed buns were enough for each person, many people insisted on taking a large bowl. After each meal, several baskets of dirty steamed buns were often collected from the tables. Also, because the cooks steamed the buns too large and used alkali unevenly, the students often threw away half of the buns randomly. This was the main reason why the food was not good.

    After finding the reason, a general meeting of all students and faculty was immediately convened, and the vice-principal gave a report against wasting food based on the inspection materials. They displayed the collected baskets and piles of leftover steamed buns and rice, and drew cartoons satirizing the waste of food on the blackboard newspaper. In this way, an atmosphere of saving food quickly formed throughout the school. Some students looked at the cartoons on the blackboard newspaper depicting people peeling steamed buns or throwing them into the trash can, and then looked at the leftover steamed buns on display with their names written on them, and said with shame: "In the past, I only complained that the food was not good, but I didn't expect the problem to be on myself. Seeing this pile of wasted steamed buns makes people regret and feel sorry!" People knew that the waste of steamed buns was very serious.

    Next, the school leaders formulated dining hall rules. The rules stipulate that: do not crowd, do not make noise, do not grab food, and do not throw away a single grain of rice when eating; implement a table leader system, with the table leader responsible for controlling the dining order at each table, ensuring mutual supervision, and not wasting food. From then on, there was no phenomenon of throwing steamed buns or spilling rice; occasionally someone violated the dining hall rules, and the students criticized each other and made self-criticisms on the blackboard newspaper. At the same time, the cooks also implemented advanced methods such as "special person responsible for special tasks" and "hanging up signs to record work" for cooking. The person who steamed the steamed buns specialized in studying how to steam steamed buns, making the buns smaller, using the right amount of alkali, and making the steamed buns delicious, so it was not easy to waste them.

    The phenomenon of wasting food cannot be completely eliminated by relying on a single anti-waste campaign. After a while, the phenomenon of leftover rice and peeling steamed buns reappeared. In April of this year, the school's Party organization, administration, trade union, Communist Youth League, and student committee organized an inspection team to go deep into the dining hall, kitchen, dormitory, classroom and other corners to thoroughly check the waste of food, and made another exhibition of the facts of food waste that were found. It is not enough to passively oppose waste; in order to more actively save food and improve food, they organized a symposium on saving food for the cooks. The cooks came up with some more ways to save: such as making sure the basin is clean, the dough is clean, and the hands are clean when kneading the dough to save flour; getting up earlier in the morning and extending the cooking time of the porridge can not only save 40 kilograms of rice, but also make the porridge taste better than before; when steaming steamed buns, adding more water appropriately when kneading the dough can steam one more cage of steamed buns with the same amount of flour than in the past, and it is also more delicious.

    The school's efforts to save food have had a great effect. In the past, the food expenses were in deficit every month, almost squeezing out the non-staple food expenses, and often only large pot dishes could be eaten; now, an average of three or four dishes are eaten per meal, and there are some meats, and the food expenses are instead in surplus.

    一个学校怎样节约了粮食
    李惠信
    石家庄华北职工初级中学有学生和教职员工一千一百多名，都在学校吃饭。过去每到月终结算伙食费的结果是月月亏累，学生们还埋怨伙食办得不好，意见很多。
    伙食管理员非常着急，可是总也找不出个原因来。有一次在月终结账时，忽然发现主食开支竟占了全部伙食费的百分之八十左右（一般的食堂主食开支占百分之五十至六十），就建议检查全校的主食浪费。经检查发现：因为伙房、饭厅没有规定制度，所以每到开饭时学生们就拥挤抢饭；本来每人吃两个馒头就够了，可是很多人偏要每人拾一大碗。每到一顿饭过后，各个饭桌上的脏馒头搜集起来常常有几筐。又由于炊事员把馒头个儿蒸的太大，用碱也不均匀，学生们就常把半块半块的馒头乱扔。这就是伙食搞不好的主要原因。
    找出来了原因，立即召开了全体学生和教职员工大会，由副校长根据检查材料作了反对浪费粮食的报告。他们把搜集起来的成筐成堆的剩馒头、剩饭展览了出来，并且在黑板报上画了讽刺浪费粮食的漫画。这样，很快就在全校形成了节约粮食的空气。有的学生看看黑板报上画的正在剥馒头皮或正在往垃圾箱丢馒头的漫画，再看看展览的剩馒头上写着自己的名字，就惭愧地说：“过去光埋怨伙食办不好，不料想毛病还在自己身上。看见这一堆被糟蹋的馒头，真叫人又后悔，又痛心！”人们都知道了浪费馒头的情况很严重。
    接着，学校领导方面制定了饭厅守则。守则规定：吃饭时不拥挤，不打闹，不抢饭，不丢一粒一粟；实行桌长制，吃饭时由桌长负责掌握每桌吃饭秩序，保证互相监督，不浪费粮食。从此，就没有扔馒头、撒饭的现象了；偶而有人违犯了饭厅守则，同学们就互相批评，在黑板报上检讨。同时，炊事员做饭也实行了“专人专责”和“挂牌记工”等先进办法，蒸馒头的人专门研究蒸馒头，把个儿蒸小了，用碱合适了，馒头好吃了，就不容易浪费了。
    浪费粮食的现象，不是只靠一次反对浪费的运动就能彻底消灭的。过了些时，又发现了剩饭和剥馒头皮的现象。今年四月份，这个学校又由党组织、行政、工会、青年团和学生委员会组织检查组，深入饭厅、伙房、宿舍、教室各个角落，详细检查了浪费粮食现象，把检查出来的浪费粮食的事实，又作了一次展览。光是消极地反对浪费还是不够的；为了更积极地节约粮食、改进伙食，他们组织炊事员开了一次节约粮食的座谈会。炊事员们又想出了一些节约办法：如和面时作到盆光、面光、手光，节约白面；早晨早些起床，延长熬粥时间，不但可以省下四十斤米，而且可以把粥熬得比以前更好吃；蒸馒头，和面适当加大水分，用同等数量的白面比过去能多蒸一笼多馒头，也更加好吃。
    这个学校节约粮食已经收到了很大效果。过去伙食费月月亏累，几乎挤掉了副食品开支，时常只能吃大锅菜；现在每顿饭平均吃三、四个菜，还有些肉食，伙食费反而有了盈余。
