More Vicious Than Murder, More Poisonous Than Arson
    —The Conspiracy Activities of Counter-Revolutionary Elements in Pingshun County to Sabotage the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative
    Xiao Lin, Jie Min

Shanxi Province's Pingshun County has uncovered a major counter-revolutionary case, exposing the conspiracy activities of counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the countryside to sabotage the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. This case once again teaches people how terrible it is to lose vigilance. After the victory of the people's revolution, some lurking counter-revolutionary elements, although not directly extending their bloody hands to murder and commit arson, use concealed means of sabotage that are more vicious than murder and more poisonous than arson!

The Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Township, Pingshun County, is led by the nationally renowned agricultural labor models Li Shunda and Shen Jilan. Since its establishment in the winter of 1951, it has become a model for the national agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Counter-revolutionary elements vainly attempted to destroy this cooperative in order to block the peasants from taking the socialist road.

The counter-revolutionary criminals Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze also adopted the "tactic of burrowing into the belly" to sabotage the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. During the establishment of the cooperative, they pretended to be "honest" and "active" to infiltrate the cooperative.

The criminal Zhang Laiquan and his father had controlled the village government before and after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Later, they colluded with the Kuomintang reactionaries, providing intelligence and carrying out activities to sabotage the anti-Japanese base areas. In 1944, Zhang Laiquan was overthrown in the mass struggle against his embezzlement of the Yicang grain. However, he did not give up. In 1950, he fabricated rumors to slander and attack village chief Guo Changze, conspiring to seize the village government. After the People's Government discovered this, he was arrested. At that time, his crimes were not thoroughly investigated, and he was released after education.

The criminal Zhang Bianze and his brother Zhang Yunke began their counter-revolutionary activities as early as 1941, sending military and political intelligence, the names of cadres, party members, and activists to the Kuomintang bandits, and spreading rumors and confusing the public in our base areas according to the instructions of the Kuomintang bandits. Their criminal activities were uncovered by the People's Government in 1943. Zhang Yunke, the head of the Kuomintang bandit intelligence liaison station, was sentenced to death; Zhang Bianze, as an accomplice, received lenient treatment.

In the winter of 1951, when Li Shunda's mutual aid group in Xigou Village was brewing the establishment of a cooperative, some peasants were still hesitating and waiting; a few old group members who had signed up to join the cooperative were still wavering and demanding to withdraw. However, the cunning Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze pretended to be active and requested to join the cooperative. As Li Shunda himself reviewed after the counter-revolutionary case was uncovered, "At that time, it was thought that people who were willing to join the cooperative had been well reformed and had made ideological progress"; at that time, the Party branch also believed that "Although Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze had participated in counter-revolutionary organizations in the past, they had been educated by the government and released leniently; now that the people have taken control of the world, what else would they dare to do?" Some comrades also believed that "The countryside has been 'middle peasant-ized', and there is no need for class struggle." Therefore, they lost their vigilance and absorbed them into the cooperative. In the early days of their joining the cooperative, they behaved very "actively." During the discussion of private plots, many cooperative members demanded to retain 30 percent, but they proposed to retain only 20 percent. They treated everyone very "amicably," and were even more respectful and "obedient to the leadership" in front of the staff. Zhang Bianze "actively" labored, and Zhang Laiquan was literate and numerate. As a result, the cooperative staff at that time everywhere said, "Laiquan and Bianze have made progress, are capable, and easy to lead." Soon, Zhang Bianze became the production team leader. Later, he was promoted to production brigade leader and was elected as a cooperative affairs committee member and model team leader. Zhang Laiquan served as an accountant and fraudulently obtained the title of labor model in 1953.

After these two counter-revolutionary elements gained a firm foothold and established a position, they began their criminal activities. Following this, the cooperative's problems increased: disunity among staff, disunity among cooperative members, frequent problems in production, chaotic systems, etc., making it difficult to promote work. However, these situations did not arouse the vigilance of the cooperative's leading staff against the destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements, who considered them to be due to shortcomings in their work and the backwardness of the masses. However, the activities of counter-revolutionary elements could not be hidden from the eyes of the broad masses. Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze's destructive activities aroused the attention of some of the masses, but the masses believed that the leadership trusted them. Some cooperative members criticized the cooperative's leading staff behind their backs, saying that they had "forgotten their own people and favored the enemy." Although this criticism reached the ears of the leading staff, it still failed to arouse vigilance, but rather was considered to be "narrow-mindedness and suspiciousness of the masses." It was not until the Party conducted education on the general line and rural class line to all Party members in Xigou Township from March to May 1954, that the activities of Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze in undermining Party unity were discovered when checking Party unity in connection with reality, and they began to be vigilant. Later, after a long period of investigation by the Public Security Bureau, all of Zhang Bianze and Zhang Laiquan's counter-revolutionary activities were found out, and the case was finally solved. A public trial and sentencing was held in Pingshun on May 2, 1955. The People's Court's judgment listed seventy-nine criminal facts committed by Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze, thoroughly exposing their counter-revolutionary truth. The entire criminal activities of these two counter-revolutionary criminals are sufficient to provide profound lessons for every Communist Party member and patriotic person.

These two counter-revolutionary elements, upon entering the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, first used every opportunity, using despicable two-faced tactics, to undermine the unity of the people, in order to cover up and carry out their criminal activities.

Let us first look at the two-faced methods of Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze in dealing with Comrade Li Shunda. In front of Comrade Li Shunda, they expressed their support for Comrade Li Shunda in everything and flattered him. When scoring work points, they deliberately tried to ingratiate themselves. Once, when assessing the workdays that Comrade Li Shunda had worked for the cooperative, other cooperative members thought that assessing 100 workdays would be reasonable, but they both proposed to set it at 170, and even said that setting it at 200 would not be too much (at that time, Comrade Li Shunda sternly rejected it). But what about behind their backs? They were completely different. In the winter of 1952, there was a heavy snowfall, and the cooperative mobilized the masses to sweep the snow. On this day, Comrade Li Shunda happened to have other things to do and did not have time to participate in sweeping the snow. Zhang Laiquan took the opportunity to instigate in front of the masses, saying that Comrade Li Shunda was a cadre and labor model, so he could still sweep the snow. In 1952, Comrade Li Shunda returned from a visit to the Soviet Union and exchanged the gifts (woolen cloth) given to him by Soviet friends for towels, which he distributed to production models in the cooperative. Zhang Bianze instigated, saying: "This is to deceive people. Li Shunda wants to look good and sound good. What is so rare about towels? It is not as good as a piece of mourning cloth." How ugly is the face of the counter-revolutionary elements! But their viciousness is not just this. Comrade Li Shunda is the Party branch secretary, and Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze tried every possible means to stir up his relationship with Comrade Ma Yuxing, the deputy branch secretary. In 1952, they said to Comrade Ma Yuxing that Comrade Li Shunda and branch committee member Song Jinshan were relatives; in front of the comrades, they deliberately attacked Comrade Ma Yuxing. In January 1954, the county held a meeting of mutual aid and cooperation representatives, but Comrade Ma Yuxing did not attend because he was burying his brother-in-law. Zhang Bianze said to Comrade Li Shunda: "Ma Yuxing is the deputy branch secretary, and he casually does not come to the meeting. What will the masses do in the future?" After the meeting, he went to Comrade Ma Yuxing and fabricated that "Shunda is not satisfied with you for not attending the meeting, and he will hold a meeting to criticize you. You should prepare quickly." This aroused Comrade Ma Yuxing's dissatisfaction with Comrade Li Shunda, and his work enthusiasm was once negative.

Between Party and non-Party staff, Zhang Bianze and Zhang Laiquan also carried out vicious instigation. Chen Jie, a county government staff member sent to Xigou Township to help with work, once revealed that he was not at ease working in the mountainous area. Zhang Laiquan smelled this, and in a casual conversation, he made a circle with his finger and said to Chen: "If you are a 'this' (referring to a Communist Party member), you will be transferred away; even if you are not transferred away, you can rise up quickly (referring to promotion); if you are not a 'this', it will not count even if you put in all your efforts." When Chen Jie fell ill, his wife went to see him, Zhang Bianze showed extra courtesy, vacated a house, and specially cooked meals to entertain them. Later, when the district committee sent Comrade Zhang Kaiji to serve as the secretary of the Xigou Township branch, Zhang Bianze again instigated Chen, saying: "This year's Chen Jie is different from last year's Chen Jie! He can no longer be the master." The counter-revolutionary elements used such methods of wooing and instigating to achieve their ulterior motives.

In order to undermine the Party's policy of relying on the poor peasants and uniting with the middle peasants in the countryside, Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze tried their best to undermine the unity of the poor and middle peasants. On the one hand, they attacked the poor peasants, deducting the income that the poor peasants should have received, so that the poor peasants did not benefit from joining the cooperative; on the other hand, they wooed the middle peasants, enticing them to leave the road of cooperativization. Zhang Laiquan used his authority as an accountant to deliberately record fewer work points and distribute less grain to poor cooperative members. In 1953, 16 poor peasant households received less grain than they should have, causing 7 cooperative members to have financial difficulties and want to withdraw from the cooperative. Especially heinous was that Zhang Laiquan swallowed the wage rice of poor peasant Lu Wenquan and changed the account of the grain distributed to Lu Wenquan, which reduced Lu Wenquan's due income by 500 jin of grain that year. Lu Wenquan worked for a year and got very little. He went to Zhang Laiquan to settle the account three times, but Zhang Laiquan falsely accused Lu Wenquan of owing 180 jin of grain and more than 20 yuan. Lu Wenquan's wife was so anxious that she jumped into a well, but was rescued. During the spring famine, the cooperative allocated 3,400 jin of grain to help households short of grain. Zhang Bianze instigated in front of the middle peasants, saying: "Let them (the poor peasants) take all the grain away. We are fools to save money and use it frugally." Some poor peasants in the cooperative could not afford to pay for the meals of the shepherds, and he said to the middle peasant cooperative members: "The poor peasants are always right, and it is our middle peasants who are unlucky." When expanding the cooperative, he said to the middle peasants: "The poor peasants who join the cooperative have thin land and weak labor. If they come in, they will ruin the cooperative." Not only that, Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze also stirred up the relationship between villages. When recording work points and distributing grain, Zhang Laiquan recorded more work points and distributed more grain to some cooperative members in Shadi? (the village where Zhang Laiquan was located); he recorded fewer work points and distributed less grain to the production team in Xigou Village. When contracting work and output, he did the opposite, deliberately setting high output and low work points for the cooperative members in Xigou Village. This was to ingratiate himself with some cooperative members in his village and create discord between the two villages.

Another major means by which these two counter-revolutionary elements sabotaged the agricultural cooperation movement was to sabotage production. They vainly hoped that peasants would not benefit from production after joining the cooperative and would not see the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, so as to fundamentally destroy the cooperative.

Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze sabotaged production, first by sabotaging the cooperative's production plan. In the spring of 1954, when spring plowing was tense, Zhang Bianze asked his group to do private work first, deliberately delaying the sowing time of the whole group by three to five days. According to his own confession, due to the delayed sowing, the whole group reduced its grain output by at least 2,000 jin that year. In order to overcome the idea of ​​cooperative members reaching the top in production, the cooperative decided that Zhang Bianze's group would cultivate 1.8 mu of high-yielding land to create high-yielding experience. The plan stipulated that in addition to applying enough base fertilizer, 14 dan of night soil should be used for planting, and 1,800 to 2,000 corn plants should be planted per mu. However, Zhang Bianze did not tell the whole group about the cooperative's plan and the tasks assigned to the team, and planted more than 400 fewer plants per mu according to his own idea, and did not use night soil for planting. As a result, the rows and plants were too sparse, seedlings were missing, and the high-yielding land became low-yielding land. Another time, he excessively densely planted corn on three mu of land, planting more than 1,000 more plants per mu, resulting in thin and yellow seedlings and reduced output. However, he pushed it off, saying: "This is the result of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union." To cover up his criminal activities, and thereby undermine the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, and increase the difficulty of promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

These two counter-revolutionary elements also deliberately sabotaged the cooperative's public property. In 1952, Zhang Bianze led a group to pick hemp in Dazhangao, and he deliberately scattered some of the hemp on the ground. Two days later, the shepherds went to graze sheep in that field, and more than 20 sheep were poisoned after eating the hemp, and two died. Ma Yuxing criticized Zhang Bianze for this, but he still did not clean it up. A few days later, two more cattle were poisoned to death. When buying sheep, they deliberately bought some sick sheep, which spread the disease and caused serious deaths.

Zhang Laiquan also deliberately messed up the accounts, failing to collect what should be collected, failing to pay what should be paid, and embezzling for his own benefit. He embezzled 172 yuan from deducting the workdays of poor cooperative members.

Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze also carried out sabotage against the central work of each period. When the state implemented unified purchase, the masses said that they would increase grain production, sell it to the state, and support the liberation of Taiwan. Zhang Bianze said to the cooperative members: "The state does not care about a few grains of our village." When carrying out the work of recruiting and supplementing soldiers, it happened that the loved one of Shen Jilan, a national labor model, had performed meritorious service in the army and sent good news, and everyone was preparing to celebrate her and improve the patriotic ideology of the masses. Zhang Bianze made sarcastic remarks, satirized Shen Jilan, and secretly spread rumors to obstruct young people from enlisting. In January 1954, Ma Yuxing promoted the purchase of economic construction bonds during a break in repairing the beach, but Zhang Bianze interjected and raised another question, saying that as long as labor models Li Shunda and Shen Jilan took out their bonuses and participated in more labor, it would be enough to buy bonds; the cooperative members stopped listening to Ma Yuxing's propaganda about purchasing bonds and stopped repairing the beach, but started calculating the accounts for Li Shunda and Shen Jilan. At this time, Zhang Bianze stood aside and watched the fun.

The public trial of Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze's case of sabotaging the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative educated the masses, as well as the Party members and cadres. The Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China required all Party members in the county to learn a lesson from this serious incident, improve their revolutionary vigilance, overcome paralysis, further combat the lurking activities of counter-revolutionary elements, and ensure the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives. And made the following decisions:
(1) All Party branches should universally accept the lessons of the Xigou Township incident, conduct a check and discussion, seriously and systematically settle the Party members' paralysis, check the Party members' shortcomings and errors. After the Party branch checks, it must formulate measures to improve vigilance, strengthen the Party branch's fortress role, give play to the leading role of Party members, overcome shortcomings, improve the Party committee, tighten organizational life, and carry out criticism and self-criticism.

After learning, the Party branch should lead the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups to learn in a planned way, and further check in connection with the existing problems in the cooperatives, and educate cooperative members to improve their vigilance.

(2) A review should be conducted on the landlords, rich peasants, and suspicious elements in the agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and handicraft production cooperatives, and the policy of relying on the poor peasants (including all new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), consolidating the unity of the middle peasants, and restricting the rich peasants should be earnestly implemented to purify the organization of the cooperatives, and truly grasp the leadership of the cooperatives in the hands of the laboring peasants led by the Party, so as to become a solid position for socialism in the countryside. And strengthen rural social security work to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

(3) Constantly strengthen political and ideological work. Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, cadres, and Party propagandists should be good at continuously conducting education among the masses, especially among cooperative members, comparing the two roads of socialism and capitalism, combining personal interests with collective interests and national interests, and abiding by the Constitution and laws, abiding by labor discipline, abiding by cooperative rules, and cherishing public property. The decision pointed out that only by continuously improving the ideological awareness of the masses can the unity within the peasants be more consolidated, the destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements can have no chance to take advantage of, and all work can be successfully advanced on the basis of the improved awareness of the peasants.

    比杀人还狠，比放火还毒
    ——平顺县反革命分子破坏金星农林牧生产合作社的阴谋活动
    萧林  洁民
    山西平顺县破获了一件重大的反革命案件，揭露了潜伏在农村中的反革命分子破坏农业互助合作运动的阴谋活动。这一案件，再次教训了人们：丧失警惕性是多末可怕。在人民革命胜利之后，有一些潜伏的反革命分子，虽则没有直接伸出血手，杀人放火，可是他们所用的隐蔽的破坏手段，却比杀人还狠，比放火还毒！
    平顺县西沟乡金星农林牧生产合作社，是全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达、申纪兰领导的。一九五一年冬建社以来，已成为全国农业互助合作运动的榜样。反革命分子妄想搞垮这个社，来阻挡农民走社会主义的道路。
    反革命罪犯张来全和张扁则，破坏金星农林牧生产合作社，也是采取的“钻进肚皮去的战术”。在建社的时候，他们伪装“老实”“积极”，混进了社。
    罪犯张来全，同他的父亲，在抗日战争爆发的前后，一直把持村政权。以后，就勾结了国民党反动派，供给情报，进行破坏抗日根据地的活动。到一九四四年，张来全在群众反对他贪污义仓粮的斗争中，才被打倒。可是，他并不死心。他在一九五○年，曾造谣污蔑、打击村长郭长则，阴谋夺取村政权。人民政府发觉后，逮捕了他。当时，没有深究他的罪恶，教育后就释放了。
    罪犯张扁则，同他的哥哥张运科，早在一九四一年就开始了反革命活动，把军政情报、干部、党员和积极分子的名单，送给国民党匪帮，并按照国民党匪帮的指使在我根据地里造谣惑众。他们的罪恶活动，在一九四三年被人民政府破案。张运科是国民党匪帮情报联络站的头子，被处死刑；张扁则是从犯，得到宽大处理。
    一九五一年冬，西沟村李顺达领导的互助组，酝酿建社的时候，有一部分农民还在犹豫和观望；有个别老组员报名入了社，还在动摇，要求退社。可是，狡猾的张来全和张扁则，却假装积极，要求入社。正像在这件反革命案件破获以后李顺达同志检讨的那样，“当时，认为人家愿意参加社，是改造得好，思想进步”；当时党的支部也认为“张来全和张扁则虽然过去参加过反革命组织，但是已经经过政府的教育，宽大释放；现在人民掌握了天下，他们还敢怎么样？”有的同志还认为“农村‘中农化’了，用不着阶级斗争了。”因而丧失了警惕性，吸收他们入了社。他们入社的初期，表现很“积极”，在讨论自留地的时候，不少社员要求自留百分之三十，他们却提出只要留百分之二十。他们对待众人很“和气”，在工作人员面前，更是毕恭毕敬，“服从领导”。张扁则“积极”劳动，张来全能写会算。于是，社里的工作人员当时就到处说“来全、扁则进步了，还能干，又好领导。”不久，张扁则当上了生产小组长。以后，提升为生产大队长，当选了社务委员和模范组长。张来全担任了会计，一九五三年骗得了劳动模范的称号。
    这两个反革命分子在他们站稳了脚跟，建立了阵地之后，就开始了罪恶的活动。跟着来的，就是社里的问题多起来了：工作人员之间不团结，社员之间不团结，生产上常出毛病，制度混乱等等，工作很难推动。但是，这些情况，并没有引起社里的领导工作人员对反革命分子破坏活动的警惕，认为是由于工作中有缺点、群众落后而来的。不过，反革命分子的活动，是瞒不过广大群众的眼睛的。张来全和张扁则的破坏活动，引起了部分群众的注意，但是群众认为领导上信任他们。曾有的社员背地里在批评社里的领导工作人员“忘了自己人，看上了敌人”。这个批评虽则传到了领导工作人员的耳朵里，但是，仍没有能引起警觉，反而认为是“群众眼光狭窄，疑心大”。直到一九五四年三月到五月的期间，党向西沟乡的全体党员进行了总路线和农村阶级路线的教育，当结合实际，检查到党内团结的时候，才发觉了张来全和张扁则破坏党内团结的活动，开始警惕起来。以后，经过公安局的长期侦察，查明了张扁则、张来全全部的反革命活动，终于破案，一九五五年五月二日在平顺举行了公审判刑。人民法院判决书上，写着张来全和张扁则犯下的七十九件罪恶事实，彻底揭出了他们反革命的真相。这两个反革命罪犯的全部罪恶活动，足以给每一个共产党员和爱国人民，提供深刻的教训。
    这两个反革命分子钻进金星农林牧生产合作社，首先就是利用一切空隙，使用卑鄙的两面派手法，破坏人民内部的团结，以便于他们掩护和施展自己的罪恶活动。
    先从张来全和张扁则对待李顺达同志的两面派的手法来看吧。当着李顺达同志的面，他们表示事事拥护李顺达同志，奉承他。在评分的时候，故意卖好。有一次，给李顺达同志评定他给社工作的劳动日，别的社员都认为评定一百个劳动日就合理了，可是他们两人却提出要定为一百七十个，甚至说，定二百个也不算多（当时，就被李顺达同志严厉拒绝了）。可是背过脸来呢？他们就完全是另外一副面孔了。一九五二年冬季，有一次下了大雪，社里动员群众扫雪。这一天，李顺达同志正遇上有别的事情，没时间去参加扫雪。张来全就趁机在群众面前挑拨，说李顺达同志是干部和劳动模范了，还能来扫雪。一九五二年，李顺达同志从苏联参观回来，把苏联朋友赠给自己的礼物（毛呢衣料）换成毛巾，分赠给社内生产模范。张扁则却挑拨说：“这是哄人哩，李顺达图好看好听。毛巾有啥稀罕，还不如一块孝布。”反革命分子的嘴脸，多么丑恶啊！可是他们的恶毒还不只这一点。李顺达同志是党支部书记，张来全和张扁则处处挑拨他同支部副书记马玉兴同志的关系。一九五二年就在马玉兴同志面前说什么李顺达同志和支部委员宋金山同志是亲戚；在同志面前，又有意打击马玉兴同志。一九五四年一月，县里召开互助合作代表会议，马玉兴同志因埋葬姐夫，没有能去参加。张扁则就在李顺达同志面前说：“马玉兴是副支书，都随便不来参加会议，往后群众该怎么样呢？”会后又到马玉兴同志那里捏造说：“你没有参加会议，顺达对你不满意，要开会整整你。你赶快准备准备。”引起马玉兴同志对李顺达同志的不满，工作情绪一度消极。
    在党和非党工作人员之间，张扁则和张来全也进行毒辣的挑拨。派到西沟乡帮助工作的县政府科员陈杰，有一次流露出不安心在山区工作的情绪，张来全嗅到了，就在闲谈的时候，用手指比成一个圆圈，对陈说：“你要是个‘这’（指是共产党员）来，就会调走；就是不调走，很快也能起来（指提拔）；你要不是个‘这’，就出死力也不算话。”当陈杰害了病，他的妻子去看他的病的时候，张扁则就格外献殷勤，给腾房子，特别做饭招待他们。以后，区委派张开基同志去担任西沟乡支部书记的时候，张扁则又对陈挑拨说：“今年的陈杰可不同于去年的陈杰了！再也不能作主啦。”反革命分子就用这样一面拉拢卖好，一面挑拨的手段，来达到自己不可告人的目的。
    为了破坏党在农村中依靠贫农、团结中农的政策，张来全和张扁则千方百计地破坏贫农和中农的团结。一方面，打击贫农，克扣贫农应得的收益，弄得贫农入社以后，得不到好处；另一方面拉中农，引诱他们离开合作化的道路。张来全利用会计职权，故意给贫苦社员少记工分，少分粮食。一九五三年就有十六户贫农少分了应得的粮食，造成七户社员生活困难，要想退社。尤其恶劣的，是张来全吞没了贫农路文全的工资米，又改了路文全分得粮食的账，这一年就使路文全应得收入减少五百斤粮食。路文全劳动一年，得的很少，三次去找张来全算账；张来全反而诬赖路文全还欠账上一百八十斤粮食和二十多元钱。路文全的妻子急得跳了井，幸被抢救起来。在春荒的时候，贫农缺粮食，社里拨出三千四百斤粮食接济缺粮户。张扁则就在中农面前挑拨说：“把这些粮食都叫他们（贫农）弄走了，咱们省吃俭用是傻瓜。”社里有的贫农管不起羊工吃饭，他又在中农社员中说：“贫农啥时也有理，就是咱们中农倒霉。”在进行扩社的时候，他在中农中说：“贫农参加社，土地薄，劳力弱，他们进来非把社搞垮不行。”不只是如此，张来全和张扁则还挑拨村同村之间的关系。张来全在记工分配粮食的时候，给沙地?（张来全所在的村）一些社员多记工分，多分粮食；给西沟村生产小组却少记工分，少分粮食。在包工包产的时候，又倒过来，故意给西沟村的社员产量定得高，工数定得少。以此来卖好本村一部分社员，制造两个村的不和。
    这两个反革命分子破坏农业合作化运动的另一个主要手段，就是破坏生产，他们妄想使农民入社之后，得不到生产上的好处，看不到农业生产合作社的优越性，从根本上来搞垮社。
    张来全和张扁则破坏生产，首先是破坏社的生产计划。一九五四年春耕紧张的时候，张扁则却叫他的一个组，先干私人的活，故意推迟全组下种时间三天到五天。据他自己供称，由于推迟播种，全组当年至少减产两千斤粮食。社内为了克服社员生产到顶的思想，确定由张扁则组培植丰产地一亩八分，创造丰产经验。计划中规定除施足底肥外，再用十四担圊肥点种，每亩栽植玉米一千八百株到两千株。可是张扁则却不把社的计划和分配给小组的任务告诉全组，照了他的主意每亩少植四百多株，又没有用圊肥点种。以致行株太稀，缺苗断垅，丰产地成了减产地。另外一次，他又在三亩玉米地上过分密植，每亩多植一千多株，以致禾苗瘦黄，造成减产。可是他却推说：“这是学习苏联先进经验的结果。”来掩护自己的罪恶活动，并从而破坏中苏友好关系，增加推广苏联先进经验的困难。
    这两个反革命分子还蓄意破坏社内公共财产。一九五二年张扁则带领小组在大掌凹摘大麻，他故意把大麻撒留在地里一部分。隔了两天，羊工到那块地里去放羊，羊吃了大麻，二十多只中毒，死了两只。为这件事，马玉兴批评了张扁则，但是他仍不去收拾。几天以后，又毒死了两头牛。在买羊的时候，故意买了一些病羊；传染开了，造成严重死亡。
    张来全还故意混乱账目，该收的不收，该支的不支，从中贪污肥己。他从克扣贫农社员劳动日中，就贪污了一百七十二元。
    张来全和张扁则，又针对各个时期的中心工作，进行破坏。国家实行统购的时候，群众说增产粮食，卖给国家，支援解放台湾。张扁则就对社员们说：“国家不在乎咱村这几颗粮食。”在进行征集 补充兵员工作的时候，恰好全国劳动模范申纪兰的爱人在部队立了功，送来喜报，大家准备向她庆功，提高群众爱国主义思想。张扁则却放出冷言冷语，讽刺申纪兰，又暗地里散播谣言，阻拦青年应征。一九五四年一月，马玉兴在修滩的休息时间，宣传购买经济建设公债，张扁则却插进来提出另外一个问题，说只要劳动模范李顺达和申纪兰拿出他们得到的奖金，多参加些劳动，就够买公债了；闹的社员不再听马玉兴关于购买公债的宣传，也不修滩了，却给李顺达和申纪兰算开了账。这时候，张扁则就站在一旁看笑话。
    张来全和张扁则破坏金星农林牧生产合作社案件的公审，教育了群众，也教育了党员和干部。中共平顺县委会要求全县党员从这一个严重事件中吸取教训，提高革命警惕性，克服麻痹思想，进一步打击反革命分子的潜伏活动，保障农业生产合作社的巩固和发展。并作出决定：
      （一）各支部要普遍接受西沟乡事件的教训，进行一次检查和讨论，认真地、系统地清算一下党员的麻痹思想，检查党员的缺点和错误。党支部在检查后，必须订出措施，提高警惕，加强党支部的堡垒作用，发挥党员的带头作用，克服缺点，健全支委会，严密组织生活，开展批评和自我批评。
    党支部学习后，要有计划地领导农业生产合作社、互助组进行学习，进一步联系社内存在的问题，进行检查，教育社员提高警惕性。
    （二）对农业生产合作社、供销合作社、信用合作社、手工业生产合作社中的地主富农和形迹可疑的分子要进行一次审查，认真地贯彻依靠贫农（包括全部原来是贫农的新中农）、巩固地团结中农、限制富农的政策，纯洁社的组织，把合作社的领导真正掌握在党所领导的劳动农民手中，成为社会主义在农村中的巩固阵地。并加强农村社会治安保卫工作，保障社会主义建设和社会主义改造的顺利进行。
    （三）经常地加强政治思想工作，党员、团员、干部和党的宣传员要善于不断地在群众中，特别是在社员中，进行关于社会主义同资本主义两条道路的对比教育，关于把个人利益同集体利益及国家利益结合起来的教育，以及关于遵守宪法和法律，遵守劳动纪律，遵守社章，爱护公共财物等多方面的教育。决定中指出只有不断提高群众思想觉悟，才能使农民内部的团结更加巩固，才能使反革命分子的破坏活动无机可乘，也才能在农民觉悟提高的基础上，使各项工作胜利前进。
