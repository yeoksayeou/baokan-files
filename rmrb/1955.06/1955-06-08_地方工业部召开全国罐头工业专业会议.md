    The Local Industry Department convened a national canned food industry professional conference in Beijing from May 20th to 30th. Based on domestic and international sales and factory production, the conference determined that this year's national canned food production will increase by about 24% compared to 1954.

    The delegates analyzed the current situation of China's canned food industry and believed that China has abundant raw materials for the canned food industry in various regions. Southern China is rich in fruits such as bananas, pineapples, and tangerines; apple production in the north is also increasing year by year; coastal and inland water products are abundant; and livestock and poultry such as pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks are available everywhere. The production potential of canned food factories scattered throughout the country is still very large. The actual output of the canned food industry in 1954 only accounted for 16.9% of the maximum production capacity. Currently, many People's Democratic countries also have a great need for canned goods produced in China.

    The conference believed that low product quality and high product costs are important issues that the canned food industry needs to address urgently. After inspecting the low product quality situation, the conference pointed out that many canned goods currently contain impurities (such as cinders, pig bristles, etc.), the jam has a burnt taste, and the ratio of items to water in the cans does not meet standards; some canned food factories neglect sanitation work, which also affects the quality of the products. The situation of high product costs is also very serious, such as in some places where one jin of canned meat is equivalent to the price of three jin of fresh pork. To this end, the conference requested that all factories strive to improve product quality, so that the qualified rate of canned food products reaches 95% to 98%. All factories must completely eliminate the phenomenon of various impurities in canned goods before the third quarter of this year. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen technical leadership, improve technical operation levels, conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and continue to carry out experience exchanges between factories. The conference requested that all canned food factories mainly strengthen the management of raw materials in terms of reducing costs, improve the utilization rate of raw materials, study the utilization methods of by-products, and requested that the cost of canned food factories in various regions be reduced by an average of 5% in 1955 compared to 1954.

    地方工业部召开全国罐头工业专业会议
    地方工业部五月二十日到三十日在北京召开了全国罐头工业专业会议。会议根据国内外销售和工厂生产情况，确定今年全国罐头产量比一九五四年提高百分之二十四左右。
    到会代表分析了我国罐头工业的现状，认为我国各地有相当丰富的罐头工业的原料。我国的南方盛产香蕉、菠萝、桔柑等水果；北方产的苹果也在逐年增加；沿海及内河水产丰富；猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭等牲畜家禽各地都有。分散在各地的罐头工厂，生产的潜力还很大。罐头工业在一九五四年的实际产量，只占到最高生产能力的百分之十六点九。目前，不少人民民主国家也很需要中国生产的罐头。
    会议认为：产品质量低和产品成本高，是罐头工业当前需要解决的重要问题。会议检查了产品质量低的状况后指出，目前有不少罐头内存有夹杂物（如煤渣、猪毛等），果酱有焦糊味，罐头内的物品和水的比例不合标准；有些罐头工厂忽视卫生工作，也影响了产品的质量。产品成本高的情况也很严重，如有些地方一斤肉罐头相当于三斤生猪肉的价格。为此，会议要求各厂努力提高产品质量，使罐头产品的合格品达到百分之九十五到九十八。各厂在今年第三季度前，必须完全消灭罐头中存有各种夹杂物的现象。同时，还要加强技术领导，提高技术操作水平，认真贯彻苏联专家建议，继续开展各厂间的经验交流工作。会议要求各罐头工厂在降低成本方面，主要是加强原材料的管理工作，提高原材料的利用率，研究副产品的利用方法，并要求各地罐头工厂一九五五年的成本比一九五四年平均降低百分之五。（新华社）
