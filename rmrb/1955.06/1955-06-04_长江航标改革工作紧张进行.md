The Yangtze River's main navigation line's navigation mark reform is progressing tensely. From Hankou to Jiangyin, five survey teams are separately surveying water levels and designing navigation mark distribution. The survey, design, and navigation mark manufacturing work for sections of the upper Yangtze River where new navigation marks need to be added this year have all been completed according to plan. The first batch of personnel who will be responsible for the maintenance and management of the new-style markers after they are installed has been concentrated in Hankou for business studies.

This year, the Yangtze River navigation mark reform covers a total length of more than 1,100 kilometers, including the entire section from Hankou to Jiangyin and the sections between Chongqing and Yichang in the upper reaches that have not yet undergone navigation mark reform. After the navigation mark reform task on this section is completed, the navigation mark reform on the entire Yangtze River will be basically completed. At that time, nearly 5,000 miles of the Yangtze River's main navigation line will be connected by Soviet chain-style navigation marks. The reform of Yangtze River navigation marks will ensure the safety of ship navigation, increase night navigation time, and improve ship turnover rates, and reduce shipping costs.

According to the original national plan, the Yangtze River's navigation mark reform this year was only planned for 486 kilometers. The workers proposed extending the navigation mark reform by more than 600 kilometers without increasing state investment. (Xinhua News Agency)

    长江航标改革工作紧张进行
    长江航运干线上的航标改革工作正在紧张进行。从汉口到江阴，有五个测量队正在分别勘测水位和设计航标分布状况。长江上游今年需要增设航标的地段，勘测、设计和航标制造工作都已按计划完成了。新式标志设置后担任维护和管理工作的第
  一批人员，已在汉口集中学习业务。
    今年长江航标改革的地段全长共一千一百多公里，包括从汉口到江阴的全部地段和上游重庆宜昌间还没有进行航标改革的地段。这段航标改革任务完成后，长江全线的航标改革就基本结束了。那时，将近五千里的长江航运干线将由苏联锁链式的航标连接起来。长江航标的改革，将保证船舶航行的安全，增加夜航时间，并能提高船舶周转率，降低航运成本。
    根据国家原订计划，长江今年航标改革的里程只有四百八十六公里。职工们提出在不增加国家投资的条件下，把航标改革的里程延长六百多公里。                                    （新华社）
