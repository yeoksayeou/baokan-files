Youth Active on the Industrial Front
    Zhan Ao, Xuan Tang

    The Shanxi Province Industrial and Mining Enterprise Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference was a joyful gathering of 393 outstanding young people from the province's industrial front. Lively, robust, simple, and enthusiastic, they all looked like ordinary young people, but each of them had a moving story.

    There was a young girl named Liu Laowen, a fine yarn worker at the Jinhua Textile Factory. She was one of the first in the factory to master the Hao Jianxiu work method. Her spindle watching ability increased from 200 spindles to 400, 800, and in November of last year, she was watching 1,200 spindles. She is only nineteen years old this year and has only been in the factory for four years, but she has won the glorious title of Provincial Industrial Labor Model for three consecutive years. Last year, she attended the Provincial People's Congress and was elected as a member of the Executive Committee of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and a member of the Provincial Women's Federation.

    The young train driver Jiang Zuotang is known as the "pioneer of exceeding axle load on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Line" at the Taiyuan North Railway Section. After the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Line was rerouted in April 1953, small locomotives were replaced with large locomotives. At that time, the crew members were not familiar with the operation, and there was a large slope on the road, so accidents often occurred. For a long time, not only did no one dare to exceed the axle load, but many people could not reach the traction quota of 800 tons. Some people advocated that the leadership should reduce the traction quota, but Jiang Zuotang was figuring out how to climb the slope. He thought: The rerouting was to improve transportation capacity. When encountering difficulties, we must overcome them; we cannot look back or reduce the axle load. He consulted experienced veteran workers and asked technicians to help him study and summarize past slope climbing experiences. On October 20th, he and the co-driver Wu Bin and the fireman Chen Lianjun drove the locomotive, pulling 856 tons, and passed the big slope, exceeding the axle load for the first time. Under his influence, thirteen locomotives also followed suit. In May of last year, Jiang Zuotang was transferred to locomotive No. 3029 as the driver leader. This locomotive was of poor quality, consumed a lot of coal, and often fell short of the axle load and had accidents. Jiang Zuotang and his team members checked the reasons for the backwardness, improved various systems, focused on locomotive maintenance, and improved their skills. By June, this locomotive began to exceed the axle load, and in October it began to save coal. In December, they undertook eight of the eleven axle load exceeding tasks of the entire section. In January of this year, they completed the monthly plan ten days ahead of schedule. On February 4th, they created the highest record of the entire section by pulling 1,073 tons.

    Youth League member Zhang Fengwen is a recent university graduate who was transferred to the thin plate department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant as a technician in June last year. He often worked with the workers, studied technology, improved operating methods, improved working conditions, and learned operating experience from the workers. He always recorded the suggestions of Soviet experts in detail and studied hard. As a result, his technical skills improved rapidly. Last winter, in order to solve the problem of broken rolling mills, he thought about installing a set of mechanized roll grinding equipment. He looked for reference books, drew sketches, contacted brother factories, consulted with veteran workers, and studied with technicians. After more than three months, the basic experiment was successful. It is estimated that after being put into production, it can increase the country's wealth by 190,000 yuan a year. In January of this year, in response to the imbalance in the utilization of roughing mills and finishing mill equipment, he proposed that 1.2 mm steel plates be rolled into three sheets instead of two as in the past. This suggestion has now been successfully tested. Preliminary calculations show that it can increase output by 8.33 percent, which can create 278,000 yuan of wealth for the country annually.

    Coal miner Bi Dejin is twenty-four years old this year. In mid-December of last year, the No. 2 mine transportation line of the Yangquan Mining Bureau experienced continuous incidents of randomly hitting the signal points, with as many as nineteen times per shift, each affecting production for several tens of minutes. Youth League member Bi Dejin remembered what the Youth League secretary said: Be vigilant at all times and prevent enemy sabotage. One day, he swapped a rest day with someone else and quietly went to the mine to observe. It was almost five o'clock when he suddenly saw a person walking out of a shed, looking around suspiciously, and secretly pressing the electric bell. The coal cars stopped. Bi Dejin went around to the side of the shed, quietly crawled on the snow, and kept his eyes fixed on the shed. At about eight o'clock, he saw the bad guy quietly come out of the shed again, peek around sneakily, and then press the electric bell again. Bi Dejin suddenly jumped up from the ground, rushed over, grabbed the bad guy, and turned him over to the security committee.

    The young Communist Party member Wang Furong is an outstanding cook who loves his work. He often says: "No matter how capable you are, you can't do without eating. Cooking is also an important task in socialist construction. If the food is well-made and everyone eats well, it can ensure a strong and powerful body and energetic production." In the year and a half that he worked in the No. 5 canteen of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, he created and improved thirteen kinds of tools, tried to make more than a dozen varieties of food, and also led everyone to learn more than eighty kinds of cooking methods. The vegetable cutting machine and dough kneading machine he created improved work efficiency and shortened the queuing time for employees to eat. He promoted "hot steamed bun boxes" and "hot dish boxes" so that comrades would not have to eat cold food. He enjoys a high prestige among the masses, and last year he was elected as a model worker of the entire factory.

    There are many more such stories. Among the 120,000 young employees active on the province's industrial front, more than 25,000 young activists have emerged. The people attending the meeting are representatives of them. In 1954, according to incomplete statistics from 75 units in the province, young employees put forward 5,235 rationalization proposals, of which 47.1 percent were adopted. In 36 units, there were 281 youth production teams (groups) and 56 youth shock brigades. They played a significant role in taking the lead in opposing waste, practicing strict economy, and breaking quotas. (Excerpted and compiled from Shanxi Daily)

    活跃在工业战线上的青年
    占敖  选堂
    在山西省工矿企业青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上，欢聚着来自全省工业战线上的三百九十三位优秀的青年。他们活泼、健壮、淳朴、热情，看上去都是些平凡的年轻人，可是他们每一个人都有着动人的事迹。
    有一个年轻的姑娘，名字叫刘老文，是晋华纺织厂的细纱工人。她是全厂掌握郝建秀工作法最早的一个。她的看锭能力由二百锭提高到四百锭、八百锭，去年十一月看到了一千二百锭。她今年刚刚十九岁，进工厂只有四年，但已经连续三年获得了省工业劳动模范的光荣称号。去年她出席了省人民代表大会，又被选为省工会联合会执行委员和省妇联委员。
    年轻的火车司机姜佐棠，被人们称为太北机务段“石太线超轴的首创者”。一九五三年四月石太线改线后，小机车换成了大机车，当时乘务员们在操作上不熟悉，再加路上有个大坡道，经常发生事故，所以在很长时间内不但没有人敢超轴，许多人还达不到八百吨的牵引定额。有人主张要求领导上降低牵引定额，姜佐棠却在捉摸着如何闯坡。他想：改线是为了提高运输能力，碰到困难要克服，不能往后看，也不能减轴。他找老师傅们请教，请技术人员帮助他研究总结以往的闯坡经验。十月二十日，他和副司机吴斌、司炉陈连俊驾驶着机车，牵引了八百五十六吨，驶过了大坡，首次超轴。在他的影响下，有十三台机车也跟着超轴。去年五月份，姜佐棠被调到三○二九号机车当司机长，这台车质量不高，费煤，经常欠轴和发生事故。姜佐棠和全组同志检查了落后原因，健全了各种制度，抓住了机车保养工作，提高技术，到六月份这台机车就开始超轴，十月开始节约煤，十二月份全段十一次超轴任务，他们就担负了八次。今年一月他们提前十天完成了月计划，二月四日，更创造了牵引一千零七十三吨的全段最高纪录。
    青年团员张峰文是刚从大学毕业的，去年六月被调到太原钢铁厂薄板部当技术员。他经常和工人们在一起，研究技术，改进操作方法，改善劳动条件，向工人学习操作经验。苏联专家的建议，他总是详细地记录，苦心学习。因此他的技术提高得很快。去年冬季，为了解决断轧辊的问题，他想着安装一套机械化磨辊设备。找参考书、绘草图、和兄弟厂联系，找老工人商量，同技术人员研究，经过三个多月，基本试验成功，估计投入生产后，一年可为国家增加十九万元财富。今年一月份，他针对粗轧机和完成机设备利用不平衡的问题，提出了一点二公厘钢板由以往两张轧制改为三张轧制。这个建议现已试验成功。初步计算，可提高产量百分之八点三三，全年可给国家创造二十七万八千元的财富。  　　煤矿工人毕德金，今年二十四岁。去年十二月中旬，阳泉矿务局二矿运输路连续发生乱打点事件，最多一班打过十九次，每次影响生产几十分钟。青年团员毕德金想起了团支书的话：时时刻刻提高警惕，防止敌人破坏。有一天，他和别人换了个轮休，悄悄地到矿上察看。快五点钟了，忽然见一个人从席棚里走出来，鬼鬼祟祟东张西望了一下，偷偷地按了一下电铃。煤车都停住了。毕德金绕到席棚旁边，悄悄地爬在雪地里，两只眼睛一刻不停地盯着席棚。约莫八点钟，只见那坏蛋又悄悄地从席棚里出来，鬼头鬼脑地看了一下，又去按了一下电铃。毕德金猛然从地上跳起来，直扑过去，将那坏蛋一把抓住，扭送到了治安委员会。
    年轻的共产党员王福荣，是一位出色的炊事员，他热爱自己的工作，他常说：“任凭你有多大的本领，不吃饭也不行。做饭同样是社会主义建设中一项重要的工作，饭做得好，大家吃得美，才能保证身体强壮有力，才能精力充沛地生产。”他在太原钢铁厂第五食堂工作的一年半中，创造和改进了十三种工具，试做了十几种饭食花样，还带动大家学习了八十多种饭的做法。他创造的切菜机、和面机提高了工作效率，缩短了职工们吃饭排队的时间。他推广了“热馍箱”、“热菜箱”，不叫同志们吃冷饭。他在群众中享有很高的威信，去年他被选为全厂劳动模范。
    像这样的事迹还有很多。活跃在全省工业战线上的十二万青年职工中，已涌现出二万五千多名青年积极分子，参加会议的人们是他们中的代表人物。一九五四年，据全省七十五个单位的不完全统计，青年职工提出了五千二百三十五件合理化建议，被采纳的占百分之四十七点一；在三十六个单位中出现了二百八十一个青年生产班（组），五十六个青年突击队，他们在带头反对浪费、厉行节约、突破定额等工作中都起了显著的作用。  （摘编自山西日报）
