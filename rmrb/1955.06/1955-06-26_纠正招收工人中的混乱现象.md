(I) To the Editor:

When some industrial departments come to Tianjin to recruit skilled workers, they blindly propose recruitment plans and then arbitrarily change them, increasing the difficulties for the labor department's work. For example, in January of this year, the Basic Construction Bureau of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry sent people to Tianjin to recruit 350 metalworking technicians. The Tianjin Labor Bureau and Industry and Commerce Bureau sent cadres to investigate and search for talent. However, on March 1st, the bureau sent a letter saying that the recruitment target would be changed to 120 workers, and finally, they sent a letter saying that they didn't need even one technician. In early April, the Machinery Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering sent people to Tianjin to recruit 192 skilled workers. In early May, they said that not only did they not need to add new workers, but they also had an internal surplus of 182 workers. Among them, the number of repairmen originally planned to be recruited was 50, but later there was a surplus of 82; the number of sheet metal workers and coppersmiths originally planned to be recruited was 25, but later there was a surplus of 52. Furthermore, the preparatory office of the Harbin Electric Brush Factory under the First Ministry of Machine Building sent cadres to Tianjin in February this year to recruit 60 skilled workers, but it is said that production will not require them until 1957. After the Tianjin Labor Bureau agreed to allocate workers, this cadre disappeared without a trace and has not made any explanation to this day.

At present, our country is very short of skilled workers. In order to meet the urgent requirements of some factories for recruiting skilled workers, the Tianjin Labor Bureau has to transfer workers from those already employed. The above-mentioned units' practice of randomly proposing recruitment plans must be corrected quickly. Zhang Xingwen

(II) To the Editor:

Some enterprises do not plan carefully when contracting workers from rural areas, causing a lot of confusion.

At the end of March, Zhang Minghe of the No. 1 Major Repair Team of the Yuci North Station Line of the Taiyuan Railway Administration sent people to Yanggao County Civil Affairs Section to recruit 270 workers on their behalf and agreed to report to the county on April 7th and depart on the 8th. The Civil Affairs Section specially assigned a cadre to allocate workers and issued notices to various townships to determine the number of workers to be recruited. On April 5th, Comrade Zhang Ming said that the construction period would be postponed, and the workers should postpone reporting. At this time, except for ten townships that could be notified by telephone, there was no time to notify the other fifty-nine townships. By April 7th, more than 160 farmers had come to the county to report one after another. Only after repeated persuasion by the Civil Affairs Section and payment of travel expenses were the farmers mobilized to return. In February, the Datong Mining Bureau Civil Engineering Construction Company booked 300 workers from our county Civil Affairs Section for brick burning and earthmoving, and sent reservation certificates, agreeing that farmers should hold the certificates and report to the construction site on April 20th. On April 13th, the company requested a cancellation of the workers; our county Civil Affairs Section immediately notified various townships. But strangely, on the 15th, the company called again and said not to cancel the workers.

Unexpectedly, on April 12th, the Beijing Railway Administration Bridge Major Repair Team came to our county to recruit 200 ordinary workers, agreeing that 20 people would start work on April 15th, 80 people on the 17th, and 100 people on the 20th. On April 15th, the team requested that the 80 people scheduled to start work on the 17th be postponed to the 19th, and our county issued a notice accordingly. Soon, the team sent someone to say that the 80 workers originally scheduled to start work on the 17th and the 100 workers scheduled to start work on the 20th were no longer needed due to work changes.

The above confusion in contracting workers has added a lot of difficulties to our work and has caused adverse effects among the masses. We hope that relevant units will pay attention to correcting it. Readers from Yanggao County, Ma Enshan, Wu Yanlin

    纠正招收工人中的混乱现象
    （一）编辑同志：
    有些工业部门到天津市招收技术工人时，盲目乱提招工计划，以后又随便变更，增加劳动部门工作上的困难。例如今年一月燃料工业部煤矿管理总局基本建设管理局派人来天津市要招收五金技术工人三百五十名，天津市劳动局、工商局曾派出干部进行摸底、搜罗人材，但到三月一日该局来信说要改为招收工人一百二十名，最后又来信说连一名技工也不要了。建筑工程部机械总局四月初派人到天津招收一百九十二名技术工人，五月初又说不仅不需要增添新的工人，且在内部多余了一百八十二名工人；其中修理工原拟招收五十名，后来反而多余了八十二名，冷作工和铜工原拟招收二十五名，后来反而多余了五十二名。还有第一机械工业部哈尔滨电刷厂筹备处，今年二月派干部来天津市招收六十名技术工人，但据说到一九五七年生产才需要；当天津市劳动局答应调配工人后，这个干部却一去不复返了，直到现在还没有作出什么交代。
    目前我国的技术工人很缺乏。为了满足某些工厂对招收技术工人的紧急要求，天津市劳动局不得不从在业工人中抽调。上述单位这种乱提招工计划的做法必须迅速纠正。　张兴文
    （二）编辑同志：
    有些企业单位到农村订约工人时计划不周，造成了很多混乱现象。
    太原铁路管理局榆次北站线路第一大修队在三月底派张明合同志要阳高县民政科代招工人二百七十名，并约定四月七日到县里报到，八日动身。民政科专门抽了一个干部来调配工人，并给各乡发通知确定招工人数。到四月五日，张明合同志说是工期要推迟，让工人延期报到。这时除了十个乡可以用电话通知外，还有五十九个乡已来不及通知了，到四月七日就有一百六十多名农民先后来县报到。经民政科再三说服，并垫付路费，才将农民动员回去。　二月间，大同矿务局土木建筑公司向我县民政科预约烧砖、推土等工人三百名，并发来了预约证，约定到四月二十日让农民各自持证到工地报到。四月十三日，公司要求退工；我县民政科马上通知各乡。但奇怪的是，十五日公司又来了电话不让退工。
    不料，四月十二日，北京铁路管理局桥梁大修队到我县招收普通工二百名，约定四月十五日上工的二十人，十七日上工的八十人，二十日上工的一百人。四月十五日，该队要求把十七日上工的八十名推迟到十九日，我县就按此发出通知。不久，该队又派人来说，原约十七日上工的八十名工人和二十日上工的一百名工人因工作变动都不要了。
    以上订约工人中的混乱现象，给我们的工作增加了很多困难，并在群众中造成不良的影响，希望有关单位注意纠正。阳高县读者　马恩山　武彦林
