At the Inaugural Meeting of the Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

Report by Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Abstract)

The Inaugural Meeting of the Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences entered its second day on the 2nd. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a report at the meeting, outlining the current situation of China's scientific work and proposing suggestions for future scientific work.

Guo Moruo said: China is engaged in a great socialist construction, vigorously improving industrial and agricultural production, realizing the socialist industrialization of the country, and promoting the modernization of national defense. In order to successfully complete these tasks, it is necessary to fully utilize China's natural and economic resources, continuously improve production technology, and therefore, it is imperative to intensify scientific research. At the same time, in the cause of socialist transformation, in cultural construction and ideological struggle, a series of arduous scientific research work must be carried out in order to successfully complete the tasks. Over the past few years, the Party and the government have been concerned about the development of scientific work. In the adjustment and enrichment of scientific research institutions, in the improvement and guidance of research methods, and in the improvement of the spiritual and material life of scientific workers, the Party and the government have shown meticulous and deep concern, and have often taken necessary measures to enable scientific work to meet the urgent requirements of the national construction cause and play its due role. Under the deep concern of the Party and the government, New China's scientific cause has made considerable improvements since the founding of the country. The first is that scientific research institutions have been adjusted and enriched. Taking the Chinese Academy of Sciences as an example, we have used great efforts from the beginning of our work to change the phenomena of overlapping institutions and dispersed manpower left over from the Kuomintang rule, and gradually established necessary new institutions. Up to now, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has forty-one research units, and the research units under the various departments of the government have more than sixty; after the adjustment of departments in national universities and colleges at the beginning of the 1954-1955 academic year, scientific research work has been initially launched.

Guo Moruo said: The victory of the Chinese revolution is the result of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and China's reality, forming a great material force. This great historical fact has educated the Chinese people and the Chinese scientists. The Chinese people and Chinese scientists are proud to have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great scientist and thinker Chairman Mao Zedong. Chinese scientists have accepted the lessons of the revolution, sincerely thank and support the Party and the government, and are willing to study the thought and methods of Marxism-Leninism. Since liberation, we have been carrying out the self-education of ideological remolding as instructed by Chairman Mao.

Guo Moruo pointed out: The vast majority of scientists have recognized the importance of establishing a dialectical materialist worldview, and therefore actively study Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology for scientific research. Many patriots abroad have also returned to the embrace of the motherland at the risk of their lives, contributing their knowledge to the construction of the motherland. We know that at present there are still many people trapped in the United States and Taiwan, feeling distressed because they cannot break free. We hope that they can break through the blockade of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and return to the ranks of the people.

When Guo Moruo talked about the achievements of research work in the past few years since liberation, he said: After the necessary adjustment and enrichment of scientific research institutions and the significant improvement of scientists' thoughts and methods, although the time spent on scientific research work itself has not been abundant in the past few years, there have been more gains in research achievements compared with the years before liberation; valuable scientific papers are constantly published in academic journals and read at academic conferences, which are valued by society; the variety and sales volume of scientific journals and scientific works are beyond what could have been dreamed of before liberation; in the field of natural sciences, there are new insights in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and geology, which are of great significance for further research work. Moreover, some research results have already played an important role in national construction. There has also been a leap forward in philosophy and social sciences. Marxism-Leninism is the guiding ideology for our national construction. In recent years, all sectors of the country have been studying this central idea, but what must be particularly mentioned here is the unfolding of the criticism of the reactionary ideas of Hu Shi, Hu Feng, and others since October last year. In this ideological struggle, many academic workers have published many papers and given many lectures in the past six months. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Writers Association have jointly held many academic seminars criticizing Hu Shi's thought. This large-scale movement to criticize bourgeois idealist thought is currently continuing actively and has achieved great results. But Guo Moruo also pointed out: Compared with the needs of national construction, the achievements of scientific work are still limited. We still have no one studying many important disciplines; no one is touching on many important issues.

Guo Moruo pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in the work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, especially shortcomings in leadership work, the most important of which is the failure to seriously study the needs of national construction to formulate a scientific development plan and promote China's scientific cause. Secondly, not enough has been done in terms of giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of scientists and establishing strong academic leadership.

In his report, Guo Moruo put forward suggestions for improving future scientific work. He said: There are still very unreasonable phenomena in the regional distribution of research institutions. We are prepared to actively establish research institutions in the interior, so that research institutions are close to production bases, promote better development of scientific and cultural undertakings in the interior, and we are also prepared to gradually establish scientific research institutions in ethnic minority areas; in carrying out scientific research work, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, strengthen the study of advanced Soviet science and absorb everything of value in world science, and we must also cherish the scientific heritage of the motherland; regarding these issues, some people in the scientific community still have very inappropriate views: some people think that studying Marxism-Leninism is of no use to the study of natural science, and some people think that the scientific achievements of capitalist countries should be completely abandoned; these are all wrong views and should be corrected. Many scientific heritages of the motherland that are worth cherishing and promoting have been neglected for a long time. In particular, Chinese medical knowledge, which has made significant contributions to the health of the Chinese people for thousands of years, is regarded as "feudal medicine" by some health workers and deliberately eliminated. Although this very bad bourgeois erroneous idea has recently been exposed, it has not been fully criticized. The extremely rich experience in China's agricultural production and handicraft production has not yet received due attention. Such serious errors urgently need to be overcome. We believe that studying and sorting out the scientific heritage of the motherland should be a major task for Chinese scientists at present.

Guo Moruo also put forward the key points of scientific research work in the first five-year plan and the key points of development of geology and other disciplines in the recent years.

Guo Moruo made suggestions on the direction of scientific work and asked the conference to discuss them. Guo Moruo believes that first of all, it is necessary to strengthen the planning of scientific work, study and formulate a long-term plan for the development of science in China. The country's large-scale construction cause is long-term, and the training of scientists and the harvest of scientific achievements all require a considerable period of time. Therefore, a long-term plan for scientific development is particularly important. Only with a long-term plan can we correctly arrange today's work; at the same time, we must give full play to the strength of scientists and actively cultivate new forces; establish a degree system, an academician system and an academic award system in order to determine academic standards and encourage the enthusiasm of those engaged in scientific research work; strengthen international scientific cooperation and strengthen academic leadership.

Guo Moruo finally said: In national construction, scientific work occupies a very important position. The Party and the government have entrusted us with the noble task of leading academic work according to the demands of the people. We have the responsibility to strengthen our scientific team and actively participate in the forefront of the national construction cause. We have the responsibility to gradually raise Chinese science to the level of international advanced science. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在中国科学院学部成立大会上
    中国科学院院长郭沫若的报告（摘要）
    中国科学院学部成立大会二日进入第二天。中国科学院院长郭沫若在会上作了报告，叙述了当前我国科学工作的情况，并对今后科学工作提出了意见。
    郭沫若说：我国正在进行着伟大的社会主义建设，正以大力来提高工农业生产、实现国家的社会主义工业化，并促进国防的现代化。为了胜利地完成这些任务，要充分地利用我国的自然资源和经济资源，要不断地改进生产技术，因而也就一定要加紧进行科学研究工作。同时，在社会主义改造事业中，在文化建设和思想斗争中，也一定要进行一系列刻苦的科学研究工作，才能胜利地完成任务。几年来党和政府一直是关心着科学工作的发展的。在科学研究机构的调整和充实上，在研究方法的改进和指导上，在科学工作者的精神生活和物质生活的提高上，党和政府都表示了无微不至的深切的关怀，并经常采取着必要的措施，使得科学工作能适应国家建设事业的迫切要求，发挥出应有的作用。在党和政府的深切关怀下，新中国的科学事业自建国以来有了不少的改进。首先是科学研究机构获得了调整和充实。拿中国科学院来说，我们在工作的开始便曾经用很大的力量来改变国民党统治时期遗留下来的机构重叠、人力分散等现象，并逐步建立了必要的新的机构。到目前为止，中国科学院已有四十一个研究单位，政府各部门所属的研究单位已有六十多个；一九五四年到一九五五年学年初全国高等学校经过院系调整之后，科学研究工作已经初步展开了。
    郭沫若说：中国革命的胜利是马克思列宁主义和中国的实际相结合而形成了伟大的物质力量的结果。这个伟大的历史事实教育了中国人民，也教育了中国科学家。中国人民、中国科学家以有中国共产党和伟大的科学家和思想家毛泽东主席的领导而感到骄傲。中国科学家接受了革命的教训，是衷心感谢并拥护党和政府的，是愿意学习马克思列宁主义的思想和方法的。解放以来，我们一直在进行着毛主席所指示的思想改造的自我教育。
    郭沫若指出：绝大多数的科学家已经认识到建立辩证唯物主义世界观的重要意义，因而积极地学习马克思列宁主义，作为科学研究的指导思想。在国外的科学家也有不少的爱国人士冒着生命的危险回到祖国的怀抱，把他们的学识贡献给祖国的建设。我们知道在目前还有好些人陷在美国和台湾，正以不能自由解脱而感到苦闷，我们希望他们能够冲破美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的封锁，回到人民的队伍里来。
    郭沫若谈到解放后几年来研究工作的成果时说：科学研究机构经过必要的调整和充实、科学家的思想和方法有了显著的改进以后，几年来尽管用在科学研究工作本身上的时间并不充裕，然而在研究成绩上比较解放前的年代却有了更多的收获；有价值的科学论文不断地在学术刊物上发表，在学术会议上宣读，都受到社会的重视；科学刊物和科学论著的出版，其种类和销售数量之多都是在解放前所不能梦想的；在自然科学方面，数学、物理学、化学、生物学、地学等领域都有新创见，对于进一步的研究工作具有重大的意义。更有一部分研究成果在国家建设中已经发生了重要作用。在哲学和社会科学方面同样有飞跃的进展。马克思列宁主义是我们国家建设的领导思想，几年来全国各界都在进行着这项中心思想的学习，但在这里必须特别提到的是从去年十月开始的对胡适、胡风等反动思想批判的展开。对于这一思想斗争，半年多来，许多学术工作者发表了不少的论文，进行了不少次的讲演。中国科学院和作家协会已经联合举办过多次的批判胡适思想的学术讨论会。这一规模宏大的批判资产阶级唯心主义思想的运动，目前正继续积极开展中，已经收到了很大的效果。但郭沫若同时指出：同国家建设的需要比较起来，科学工作的成就依然是有限的。许多重要的学科，我们还根本没有人研究；好些重要的问题，也根本没有人接触。
    郭沫若指出中国科学院工作中还存在着很多缺点，特别是领导工作中的缺点，其中最主要的就是没有认真研究国家建设的需要，来制定科学发展计划，推进我国科学事业。其次，在发挥科学家的积极性和创造性、树立坚强的学术领导等方面也都做得不够。
    郭沫若在报告中提出了对改进今后科学工作的意见。他说：研究机构的地区分布方面还存在着很不合理的现象，我们准备积极地在内地建立研究机构，使研究机构接近生产基地，促使内地科学文化事业得以更好的发展，在少数民族地区我们也准备逐渐设立科学研究机构；在进行科学研究工作中，我们必须加强马克思列宁主义的学习，加强苏联先进科学的学习并吸取世界科学中一切有价值的东西，还必须珍视祖国科学遗产；关于这些问题，科学界至今还有些人存在很不妥当的看法：有的人认为学习马克思列宁主义对自然科学的研究没有什么用处，也有的人认为资本主义国家的科学成就应该根本抛弃；这些都是错误的见解，是应该加以改正的。祖国许多值得珍重和发扬的科学遗产更是长期被忽视，特别是几千年来对中国人民的健康有重大贡献的中国医药知识被一部分卫生工作人员视为
  “封建医”，而蓄意加以消灭，这种十分恶劣的资产阶级错误思想最近虽被揭发，但还没有展开充分的批判。我国的农业生产和手工业生产中极其丰富的经验直到今天也依然没有受到应有的重视。这样的严重错误是急需克服的。我们认为，研究并整理祖国科学遗产应该是我国科学家当前的一项重大任务。
    郭沫若并提出了在第一个五年计划中科学研究工作的重点和地质等学科在最近几年内的发展重点。
    郭沫若对科学工作的方针上提出了建议，要求大会讨论。郭沫若认为首先要加强科学工作的计划性、研究并制定我国科学发展的远景计划，国家大规模的建设事业是长远的，科学家的培养和科学成果的收获也都需要相当长远的时间，因此，科学发展的远景计划就尤其重要。只有有了远景计划，才能够正确地安排今天的工作；同时要充分发挥科学家力量，积极培养新生力量；建立学位制度、院士制度和学术奖励制度，以便确定学术标准，鼓励从事科学研究工作者的积极性；加强国际间的科学合作以及加强学术领导。
    郭沫若最后说：在国家建设中科学工作既占有十分重要的地位，党和政府根据人民的要求把领导学术工作这样崇高的任务交给了我们，我们有责任壮大我们的科学队伍，积极参加到国家建设事业的最前线。我们有责任把中国科学逐步提高到国际先进科学的水平。　（新华社）
