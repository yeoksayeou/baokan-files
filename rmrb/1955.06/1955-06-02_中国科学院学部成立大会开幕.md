Xinhua News Agency, June 1st. The inaugural meeting of the Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences opened this morning in Beijing. The Divisions of Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry; Biology, Earth Sciences, and Technology Sciences; and Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were officially established.

In addition to the members of the four academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the meeting was attended by heads of various research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, researchers from various units in Beijing, and heads of research institutions from relevant universities and business departments in the capital.

Also attending the opening ceremony were responsible persons from relevant departments of the Chinese Communist Party and the government.

The delegation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the delegation of the Polish Academy of Sciences, scientists from Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and Soviet experts who have come to China to assist in construction were also invited to attend the meeting.

Academician Yudin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Soviet Ambassador to China, was also invited to attend the meeting.

More than 500 people attended the meeting.

Guo Moruo, in his opening speech, explained the great significance of the establishment of the four academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Guo Moruo said: In order to make scientific undertakings meet the needs of national construction, it is necessary to establish and improve the national scientific leadership center, absorb outstanding scientists from various departments and regions across the country to participate in the academic leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and enable the development of national scientific research work and scientific undertakings to be carried out in a more organized and planned manner according to national needs. The establishment of the four academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is precisely the embodiment of this measure. Guo Moruo said: Since January 1954, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been brewing and preparing for the establishment of academic divisions in the national scientific community; after more than a year of repeated discussions and consultations, a total of 233 members of the four academic divisions were elected, and they have made many contributions to China's scientific undertakings in academic research or scientific organization work. Guo Moruo then pointed out: The establishment of the academic divisions marks the beginning of a new stage in the development of China's scientific undertakings; because the academic divisions have a large number of representative scientists from various major scientific departments in China to conduct collective leadership, the Academy of Sciences can strengthen academic leadership or guidance for scientific research work inside and outside the Academy, strengthen the planning and organization of scientific work, and also prepare better conditions for the Chinese Academy of Sciences to further establish academic titles and degree systems.

Chen Yi, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at the meeting. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, Chen Yi congratulated the meeting and the Chinese scientific community. Chen Yi said: This meeting is a major event in the Chinese scientific community. Through this meeting, outstanding scientists from all over the country will be better organized, which is of great significance for the realization of the country's Five-Year Plan. Chen Yi pointed out: Since liberation, Chinese scientists have completed many valuable studies, and some research results have played a significant role in the country's economic construction. Chen Yi, on behalf of the Party and the government, thanked Chinese scientists for their support for the national construction cause. Chen Yi also encouraged scientists to use their labor and wisdom to answer the country's and people's demands for science.

Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, then spoke. He said: The Chinese Academy of Sciences has organized outstanding scientists from all over the country to establish academic divisions, and will unite and organize scientific workers across the country through the academic divisions to serve national construction. This is an important step for scientific workers to realize the country's first Five-Year Plan and the general task of the transition period.

Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, encouraged scientists to be concerned about politics in his speech. Dong Biwu pointed out: An advanced social system is a guarantee for the development of science and for scientific achievements to benefit mankind. Only after the founding of New China can scientists have the conditions to exert their wisdom and better serve the people.

Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also spoke at the meeting. He pointed out: Because our country has a people's democratic dictatorship, as well as the help of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, the development of scientific undertakings has extremely broad prospects. He encouraged scientific workers to work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, improve the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism, improve scientific research work, and better serve the cause of socialist construction, so that our country will be transformed from a scientifically backward country into a scientifically advanced country within a certain period of time.

Academician Bardin, head of the delegation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Academician Wierzbicki, head of the delegation of the Polish Academy of Sciences, were invited to speak at the opening ceremony. They expressed their happiness at having the opportunity to understand the work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and their willingness to provide assistance to Chinese scientific work. Bardin also presented a batch of works by famous Soviet scientists published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to the Chinese Academy of Sciences at the meeting.

Zoologist Bing Zhi, historian Chen Yuan, mathematician Chen Jiangong, and chemical engineer Hou Debang spoke on behalf of the Divisions of Biology and Earth Sciences, Philosophy and Social Sciences, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry, and Technology Sciences, respectively. They all expressed their willingness to dedicate their efforts to the socialist construction of the motherland and the development of scientific undertakings. Bao Erhan, member of the Division of Philosophy and Social Sciences and historical linguist, also spoke.

The meeting is scheduled to last for nine days.

  　中国共产党中央委员、国务院副总理陈毅在会上致词。陈毅代表中国共产党中央委员会和国务院向大会和中国科学界致贺。陈毅说：这次大会是中国科学界的重大事件，通过这次大会，全国优秀科学家将更好地组织起来，这对实现国家的五年计划有重大意义。陈毅指出：解放以来中国科学家完成了很多有价值的研究，有些研究成果已在国家经济建设中起了重大的作用。陈毅代表党和政府感谢中国科学家对国家建设事业的支持。陈毅并勉励科学家要用自己的劳动和智慧来回答国家和人民对科学的要求。

    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席董必武在讲话中勉励科学家要关心政治。董必武指出：先进的社会制度是发展科学并使科学成果能造福人类的保证。新中国成立以后，科学家们才有条件发挥他们的智慧，并更好地为人民服务。
    中国共产党中央宣传部长陆定一也在会上讲了话。他指出：由于我国有人民民主专政的政权，以及苏联和各人民民主国家的帮助，科学事业的发展是有极其广泛的前途的。他勉励科学工作者努力学习马克思列宁主义，提高马克思列宁主义的理论水平，改进科学研究工作，更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。使我国在一定的时期内，由科学落后的国家变为科学先进的国家。
