    Since the nationwide grain saving campaign began in March, many collective catering units in major and medium-sized cities, such as enterprises, government agencies, organizations, and schools, have begun to establish a new ethos that "wasting grain is a shameful act." Saving grain has gradually become a conscious action of the masses. Many catering units have come up with good ways to save grain, reducing waste. This not only saves grain for the country, but also improves the meals in these units.

    However, it must not be assumed that collective catering units have done a good job in saving grain and strictly implementing the state's unified grain sales policy. On the contrary, there are still many problems in these areas, and some of them are very serious. Materials revealed from various places show that there are many phenomena of falsely reporting and illegally obtaining grain, and violating the state's unified grain sales policy. Even after the state adopted further measures and implemented the grain budget system, many units were still "padding" their numbers and trying to find ways to purchase more grain from the state. The catering unit of the Materials Supply Department of the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Administration Bureau has an average of 40 transient diners every day in addition to the fixed number of diners. The grain purchase plan reported by this unit for these transient diners is 4,500 jin of grain per month, averaging 112.5 jin of grain per person per month, or 3.12 jin of grain per person per day. If this grain were flour and made into steamed buns, each person would have an average of 37 steamed buns weighing 2.3 liang each per day. Who can believe that everyone has such a large appetite? The seriousness of the problem is that this phenomenon is not isolated. For example, according to a survey of 156 catering units belonging to a certain agency in Shanghai, the grain purchase plans these units set were generally 10% to 20% higher than the actual needs, and some even exceeded 50%.

    Why do many collective catering units universally report grain purchase plans that are too high? On the one hand, it is true that there are still some imperfections in the grain supply system, but more importantly, the responsible persons and management personnel of those units that over-report grain purchase figures have not yet truly recognized the political significance of the state's implementation of unified grain sales, and have not realized the serious harm that this practice of over-reporting grain purchase figures causes to the country.

    The responsible persons of these units verbally admit the necessity of unified grain sales. However, their actions directly violate the state's grain planned supply system. They are preoccupied with whether their small units can be "flexible," "free," and "convenient" in using grain. However, they are unwilling to think for the country. They use methods such as falsely reporting the number of people and concealing inventory to falsely report grain purchase plans, in order to purchase as much grain as possible and establish their own small warehouses. In their view, grain stockpiled in their small warehouses is more "insured" than in the state's large warehouses. To defend the behavior of over-reporting grain purchase plans, they have come up with various reasons or excuses.

    One of their reasons is to emphasize the special difficulties of their unit:
  "Our unit has a large number of people and a high degree of personnel mobility, so it is impossible to accurately grasp the grain purchase plan, so we have to set the plan higher." Of course, a large number of people and high mobility will cause some difficulties in grasping the grain purchase plan; but this difficulty is by no means insurmountable. Why is it that in the case of the same number of people and the same degree of mobility, some units set grain purchase plans that are relatively close to the actual situation, while other units set grain purchase plans that far exceed the actual needs? The reason is that the former strictly abides by the state's grain planned supply system and treats the grain purchase plan with a serious, responsible and realistic attitude; while the latter simply emphasizes the difficulties of its own unit and does not strictly abide by the grain planned supply system.

    Another more common excuse is: "Grain is eaten sooner or later, so it can't be considered a waste." This is actually equivalent to saying that "padding" the numbers and purchasing more grain is legal. This kind of erroneous thinking must be resolutely opposed. First of all, "padding" itself is a serious disruption to the state's grain plan. If the grain purchase plan of every collective catering unit exceeds the actual needs by thousands or tens of thousands of jin, then, when concentrated, it will inevitably cause the state's grain supply plan to be loaded with a large false portion. In this case, how can the state accurately implement the grain plan and guarantee the grain supply? It can be seen that the grain purchase plan cannot be "padded". Moreover, after "padding", it will actually inevitably lead to varying degrees of "loose use", opening the door wide for waste of grain and illegal resale of grain.

    Some people also think that: "Setting the quota too rigidly, it is too troublesome to apply again for temporary needs." Yes, there are troubles in implementing the state's grain planned supply system, just as any work inevitably has troubles of all sizes. The question is what attitude to take towards work. With a correct attitude towards work, you will not be afraid of trouble. If every unit is unwilling to endure a little trouble in grain purchase and use, it will inevitably cause greater trouble and harm to the state's implementation of the grain plan. Anyone who safeguards the interests of the country should never just haggle over the troubles or convenience of their own unit on the grain issue, and throw the interests of the country aside.

    The members of government agencies, organizations, enterprises, schools, and other units are the advanced part of the urban residents. The amount of grain used by these units accounts for a large proportion of the total urban grain supply. Therefore, whether these units can abide by the state's grain planned supply system is of extreme importance. If they falsely report plans, receive more grain, and waste grain, they will not only directly disrupt the state's grain plan, but also create a very bad influence among urban residents and even farmers. Therefore, each unit must face up to its own position and seriously abide by the state's grain planned supply system and grain saving aspects, and set an example for the general urban residents.

    How can collective catering units implement the state's grain planned supply system well? The key lies in the fact that the leading personnel of each unit must regularly guide and supervise the formulation and implementation of the grain purchase plan of their unit. Since the grain saving campaign was launched in March this year, the leading personnel of many units have mobilized and called on their members, but not many units have really made achievements. The grain saving campaign of many units has passed like a gust of wind; after this gust of wind has passed, the leading personnel of these units no longer care about or ask about grain matters. This situation of leading personnel not asking about grain issues has not changed significantly until recently when various places began to rectify the urban grain unified sales work. For example, the grain purchase plan for June reported by the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau No. 3 was not seriously reviewed by the leading personnel at all. The plan only had the seal of a staff member of the office, and this staff member knew nothing about the number of people eating in the unit, the monthly amount of grain used, the amount of grain in stock, and so on. The bureau had 100 fewer people in June than in May, but the grain purchase plan increased by 1,453 jin compared to May. Similar situations must be resolutely and quickly corrected. From now on, the leading personnel of each unit must be responsible for the implementation of the state's grain planned supply system in their unit. They must always pay attention to educating their members, seriously and responsibly leading the formulation of a reasonable grain purchase plan and grain use system in their unit, and ensuring its implementation. When formulating grain purchase plans, each unit must conduct serious verification and accounting of the number of grain users, the amount of grain used, and the grain inventory; the erroneous practice of formulating grain purchase plans based only on rough and excessively high estimates must be resolutely opposed. An engineering company of the Ministry of Light Industry in Beijing, led by the leading personnel themselves, formulated a grain purchase plan for June in accordance with the spirit of saving grain, and the planned amount of grain used per person was nearly 13 liang less than the actual amount of grain used in May. It can be seen from this that as long as the leading personnel of each collective catering unit strictly abide by the state's grain planned supply system and conscientiously and responsibly formulate the grain purchase plan of their unit, then each unit will definitely be able to set a grain purchase plan that is more in line with the actual situation, so that the amount of grain consumption reaches a reasonable level.

    用严肃负责的态度制定购粮计划
    江维
    自三月份开展全国性的节约粮食运动以来，各大中城市的许多企业、机关、团体、学校等集体伙食单位的就食人员，开始树立了“浪费粮食是可耻行为”的新风气；节约粮食逐渐成为群众的自觉行动；不少伙食单位想出了许多节约粮食的好办法，减少了浪费现象。这不但为国家节约了粮食，而且这些单位的伙食也得到了改善。
    但是，绝不能认为集体伙食单位在节约粮食，严格执行国家的粮食统销政策方面已经做得很好了。相反地，在这些方面还有很多问题，有些问题而且十分严重。从各地陆续揭发的材料可以看出，虚报冒领、违犯粮食统销政策的现象是很多的。而在国家采取进一步的措施，实行粮食预决算制度以后，许多单位仍然在“宽打窄用”，想各种办法向国家多购粮食。北京市房地产管理局器材供应处的伙食单位除固定入伙人数以外，每天平均有流动入伙人数四十人，这个单位为这些流动入伙人员造报的购粮计划是每月四千五百斤粮食，平均每月每人合一百十二斤半粮食，每人每天合三斤十二两粮食。如果这些粮食是面粉，把它做成馒头，每人每天平均有三十七个二两三钱重的馒头。试问，谁能相信每个人都有这样大的饭量呢？问题的严重性还在于这种现象并不是个别的。例如，根据上海市某机关所属的一百五十六个伙食单位的调查，这些单位订的购粮计划一般都比实际需要量高百分之十到二十，有的竟超过百分之五十。
    为什么很多集体伙食单位造报购粮计划普遍地偏高呢？一方面固然由于粮食供应制度上还有不够完善的地方，但更重要的却是那些多报购粮数字的单位的负责人员和管理人员，还没有真正认识到国家实行粮食统销的政治意义，还没有意识到这种多报购粮数字的作法对于国家的严重危害性。
    这些单位的负责人员在口头上是承认粮食统销的必要性的。但是他们的行为却同国家的粮食计划供应制度直接违背。他们念念不忘的是自己小单位在使用粮食上能不能“机动”，能不能“自由”，是不是“方便”。但是却不肯去为国家着想。他们用虚报人数、隐瞒库存等办法来虚报购粮计划，以便尽可能地多购些粮食，建立自己的小仓库。在他们看来，粮食积压在他们的小仓库里，总比放在国家的大仓库里更“保险”些。为了给多报购粮计划的行为辩护，他们还想出了各种各样的理由或借口。
    他们的理由之一是强调本单位的特殊困难：
  “我们单位人员多，人口流动性大，购粮计划无法掌握得准确，只好把计划定大些。”当然，人员多和流动性大，会造成掌握购粮计划的一些困难；但是这个困难决不是不可克服的。为什么在人员同样多、流动性同样大的情况下，有些单位定出的购粮计划就比较接近实际，另一些单位定出的购粮计划却远超过实际需要呢？原因就在于前者严格遵守国家的粮食计划供应制度，用严肃负责和实事求是的态度来对待购粮计划；而后者只是单纯强调本单位的困难，没有严格遵守粮食计划供应制度。
    还有一种更普遍的借口是：“多领了粮食，早晚也得吃掉，这不能算是浪费。”这实际上等于说
  “宽打窄用”多购粮食是合法的。对于这种错误思想，必须坚决反对。首先，“宽打”本身就是对国家粮食计划的严重破坏。如果每一个集体伙食单位的购粮计划都超过实际需要几千斤或几万斤，那末，集中起来，就必然使国家的粮食供应计划带上
  一个很大的虚假部分，在这种情况下，国家怎能准确地执行粮食计划和保证粮食供应呢？可见，购粮计划是“宽打”不得的。何况，“宽打”了之后，实际上就势必造成不同程度的“宽用”，为浪费粮食和违法转卖粮食等行为大开方便之门。
    还有一些人认为：“定量定得太死，有了临时需要再申请，太麻烦。”是的，在执行国家粮食计划供应制度当中麻烦是有的，正如做任何工作都难免有大大小小的麻烦一样，问题在于用什么态度来对待工作。用正确的态度对待工作，就不会害怕麻烦。如果每个单位在购粮用粮上面都不肯忍受一点小麻烦，就必然会给国家执行粮食计划造成更大的麻烦和危害。凡是维护国家利益的人，决不应该在粮食问题上只是斤斤计较本单位的麻烦或方便，而把国家的利益丢在一边。
    机关、团体、企业、学校等单位的成员，都是城市居民群众中的先进部分，这些单位的用粮数量在城市粮食供应总量中占有很大的比重；因此这些单位能否遵守国家粮食计划供应制度，关系是极为重大的。如果它们虚报计划、多领粮食、浪费粮食，就不但直接地破坏了国家粮食计划，而且在城市居民以至农民中造成极坏的影响。因此，每个单位都必须正视自己所处的地位，认真地遵守国家粮食计划供应制度和节约粮食方面，为一般城市居民做出榜样。
    集体伙食单位怎样才能执行好国家粮食计划供应制度呢？关键在于每个单位的领导人员必须经常指导和监督本单位购粮计划的制定和执行。从今年三月开展节约粮食运动以来，许多单位的领导人员都向所属成员作了动员和号召，但是真正做出成绩的单位并不多。许多单位的节约粮食运动像一阵风似地吹过去了；这阵风过去以后，这些单位的领导人员就再也不关心和过问粮食的事了。这种领导人员不过问粮食问题的情况，直到最近各地整顿城市粮食统销工作开始后仍然没有显著的转变。例如北京市电信三局造报的六月份购粮计划根本没有经过领导人员的认真审查，计划上只盖了办公室一个工作人员的章，而这位工作人员对本单位的吃饭人数、每月用粮数量、粮食库存数量等等都茫无所知。该局六月份比五月份减少了一百人，但购粮计划却比五月份增加了一千四百五十三斤。类似这样的情况必须坚决迅速纠正。今后每个单位的领导人员必须对本单位执行国家粮食计划供应制度负责任，他们必须经常注意对所属人员进行教育，严肃负责地领导本单位制定出合理的购粮计划和用粮制度，并保证贯彻执行。每个单位在制定购粮计划时，都必须对用粮人数、用粮数量和粮食库存进行认真的查对和核算；那种只根据大概的过高的估计来制定购粮计划的错误作法，必须坚决反对。轻工业部在北京市的一个工程公司由领导人员亲自主持，根据节约粮食的精神制定的六月份购粮计划，每人计划用粮量比五月份实际用粮量减少了将近十三两多。由此可见，只要各个集体伙食单位的领导人员严格遵守国家粮食计划供应制度，认真负责地制定本单位的购粮计划，那末，各单位就一定可以定出比较切合实际的购粮计划，使粮食消费量达到合理。
