What Else Can the Hu Feng Elements Say Now?
Jun Qing

In extreme anger, I finished reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. I was reminded of 1946, when A Long and Hu Feng were "full of optimism" about the "overall situation," the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launched a "do or die" heinous attack on the liberated areas. In those bloody days, I personally witnessed how landlords and counter-revolutionaries like Zhuang Yong, a Hu Feng element, used vicious butcher knives to brutally massacre countless kind people in the liberated areas. While Lü Yuan was "really starting to be a human" in the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," how many of our loyal comrades, who struggled tirelessly for the cause of the people's revolution, shed their precious blood in the gloomy den of Ciqikou!

Now, what else is there to say? The matter is already so clear and obvious: Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique are nothing more than loyal running dogs of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. For a long time, they have been following their masters, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and American imperialism, in carrying out counter-revolutionary criminal activities. When the Kuomintang bandit gang launched the civil war aggressively, they were so elated, "full of optimism," waving flags and shouting: "If it's pus, it must be drained!" When the Chinese people achieved a great victory and the reactionary regime of the Chiang bandit gang collapsed, they were so "painful" and "uneasy," preparing to "meet suffering," preparing for "solid, better work." Later, they really "worked." They changed their appearances and infiltrated the inside of our revolutionary camp. These executioners, whose hands were still stained with blood yesterday, became "writers" and "professors" today; the special agents of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," who were still cursing the Communist Party as "the evil Commies" yesterday, became "poets" and "party members" today. When our country is striding forward to a socialist society, and the people of the whole country are carrying out socialist construction with confidence and joy, these Hu Feng elements curse "this social order" day and night and hate "everyone."

What else needs to be explained? The fact is already so clear and obvious: The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is our mortal enemy. We want revolution, and they oppose revolution. We want to build a socialist society, and they want to undermine socialist construction, attempting to restore the reactionary rule of the Chiang bandit gang. We want to live, to live better, and they want us to die. For such enemies, we can only resolutely and thoroughly suppress them! Without doing so, we cannot guarantee the victory of our socialist construction; without doing so, we cannot guarantee the happiness and tranquility of our people's lives.

    现在胡风分子还有什么话可说
    峻青
    在极度的愤怒中，我看完了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料。我想起一九四六年，就在阿垅和胡风对“大局”“充满了乐观”的时候，蒋介石匪帮向解放区发动了“一不做，二不休”的罪恶进攻。在那些血淋淋的日子里，我亲眼看到：像胡风分子庄涌之类的地主、反革命分子，是在怎样地拿着凶恶的屠刀，惨酷地屠杀了解放区无数的善良人民。就在绿原在“中美合作所”“真的开始做人”的时候，我们多少忠心耿耿为人民革命事业而奋斗不懈的同志，在磁器口这个阴森森的魔窟里，流尽了宝贵的鲜血！
    现在，还有什么话可说呢？事情已经如此清楚、明显：胡风及其反革命集团，不是些别的东西，而是帝国主义和蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗。他们长时期以来，就追随着他们的主子蒋介石卖国集团和美帝国主义进行反革命的罪恶勾当。当国民党匪帮气势汹汹地发动内战的时候，他们是那样地兴高采烈，“充满了乐观”，摇旗呐喊着：“是脓，总要排出！”当中国人民取得了伟大的胜利、蒋匪帮的反动政权垮台了的时候，他们又是那样的“痛苦”“不安”，准备“迎接苦难”，准备“坚实的、更好的工作”。后来，他们果真就“工作”了。他们摇身一变，混进了我们革命阵营的内部，这些昨天还是双手涂满了鲜血的刽子手，今天变成了“作家”“教授”；昨天还在咒骂共产党是“万恶的共匪”的“中美合作所”的特务，今天变成了“诗人”“党员”。当我们的国家正在大踏步地过渡到社会主义社会，全国人民正在满怀着信心欢欣鼓舞地进行着社会主义建设的时候，这些胡风分子日夜咒骂着“这个社会秩序”，仇恨着“一切人”。
    还需要什么说明呢？事实已经如此地清楚、明显：胡风反革命集团就是我们的死敌。我们要革命，他们就反革命。我们要建设社会主义社会，他们就要破坏社会主义建设事业，企图恢复蒋匪帮的反动统治。我们要活，要活得更好，他们就要我们死。对于这样的敌人，我们只有坚决彻底地把他们镇压！不如此，就不能保证我们社会主义建设的胜利，不如此，就不能保证我们人民生活的幸福和安宁。
