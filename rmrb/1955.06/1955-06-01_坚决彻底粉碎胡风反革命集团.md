Resolutely and Thoroughly Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique

Thoroughly Expose Hu Feng's Political Face

Yi Qun

For over a decade, I was one of the literary and art workers who had prolonged contact with Hu Feng and felt continuously treated with "insults wrapped in smiles" by him. However, I always regarded him as a friend in the progressive literary and art endeavor. I also listened to and read Hu Feng's arguments against "formalism" and "objectivism" for a long time, and had oral and written debates with him, but I always viewed them as differences in literary opinions. Today, after comparing the two batches of materials exposed by the "People's Daily," I have awakened as if from a dream and realized Hu Feng's consistent true face of hostility towards the Party and literary and art workers under the Party's leadership. We were truly lacking in vigilance against this enemy! We never imagined that Hu Feng was for so long "considering methods," "strengthening his forces," "determined to coexist with the battleground," using "the tactic of cluster grenades," to "continue the effort" in launching "charges" against the literary and art work led by the Party, and even attempting to "use a whip wrapped in rubber-coated steel wire to beat prisoners," to strike literary and art workers under the Party's leadership, so as to "injure them without leaving visible scars on the surface."

I personally experienced most of the "era" situation mentioned in Hu Feng's secret letter to Shu Wu, and I even participated in the ranks of the "gentry," "petty merchants," and "young masters" that Hu Feng referred to. Recalling the situation at the time and comparing it with Hu Feng's schemes, I feel infinite indignation! In those days before liberation, under the Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel oppression, the literary and art work led by the Party was extremely arduous. On the one hand, it was necessary to unite progressive and intermediate literary and art workers to form a literary and art front that adhered to resisting Japan and opposing compromise, striving for democracy and opposing dictatorship, adhering to unity and opposing division; on the other hand, it was necessary to oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' control and persecution and carry out progressive literary and art movements. But what "work" did Hu Feng openly do during that long and difficult stage?

He satirized the direction of literary and art work that "requires creation to start from an idea," believing that "ideas are priceless," denouncing it as "treating ideological concepts as a large banner, which, when planted on the head, can scare the readers into submission"; he pointed out that the proposition of "requiring writers to write about brightness and positive characters" [Note] "is to strangle literature and art," "is to ask writers to lie," and "is to try to kill the spirit of realism"; he believed that the "ideology" "attached to" the works was "the utterly exhausted petty bourgeoisie's perfunctory understanding of life"; he insulted these people as "petty merchants who make a living by selling formulas."

He raised the banner of "opposing objectivism," pointing out that progressive writers such as Mao Dun and Sha Ting were "content with the status quo," "their enthusiasm was waning," and they had a "follow-the-tide attitude towards life."

Relying on the guise of "the tradition of realism," he attacked the use of old forms such as ballad singing, songs, and chapter novels to express the content of the War of Resistance in the early stage, contemptuously referring to it as "catering to phenomena," which can only obtain "the distorting effect of accepting backward consciousness and backward forms." And he generally obliterated the significance of popularizing literary and art work, believing it to be a "sell-smiles attitude towards life"; pointing out that the view that "the more readers or audiences, the greater the significance of the work" is "catering to" "the hobbies of various new and old petty citizens," "asking only about the purpose and not caring about the means," and a "comic tragedy of the War of Resistance or revolution."

In the posture of a defender of "realism," he pointed out that the proposition of adhering to the united front in literature and art was "using abstract patriotism to condone, shield, and even encourage all hypocritical and even decadent literary and art phenomena," and "discriminating against or even being hostile to the efforts of realism."

He openly declared with teeth and claws: "I dare to speak with a supra-class personality," using the most tyrannical attitude to denounce everything in the progressive literary and art circles, shamelessly elevating himself and the status of his small clique.

On the other hand, during such a long period of acute struggle between the enemy and us, we have never seen Hu Feng criticize the "literary and art work" of Zhang Daofan, Li Chendong, Wang Pingling, and other lackeys of the Kuomintang reactionaries in even fragmented articles.

We and many readers have not recognized his political face from the front side of all the "work" that Hu Feng and his group have been carrying out for a long time. Today, after reading this extremely small part of his secret letters, we have only initially recognized his absolutely non-"supra-class personality," and only begun to see his absurd ambition of "taking the world as his responsibility," "everything is complete in me," and the arrogant attempt that "a great will runs through China"!

We must further and thoroughly expose Hu Feng's political face!

[Note]: See Hu Feng's "Realism Today," published in the Chongqing "Shishi Xinbao" on January 1, 1944. At that time, Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" had already been published in the Chongqing "Xinhua Daily."

Severely Punish Hu Feng and Liquidate the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique

Jia Ji

What kind of person is Hu Feng? What kind of activities has the Hu Feng clique been engaged in for many years? His notoriously "Opinions on Literary and Art Issues" has already revealed his fox's tail; and his secret letters to his lackeys further confirm that Hu Feng is a vicious and heinous head of a counter-revolutionary black gang, and the Hu Feng clique has been carrying out anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiracy activities for many years!

What is most infuriating and shocking is that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's conspiracy activities have always been carried out within our people's revolutionary camp in the two-faced manner of thugs like Trotsky and Bukharin. When our People's Liberation War was being carried out intensely, Hu Feng sent people to Kuomintang reactionary newspapers and periodicals to cooperate with the Jiang bandit gang to attack our Party and the people; after our People's Liberation War was victorious, Hu Feng wanted to be more calm and put more effort into undermining this victory. Hu Feng, in the same tone as the Jiang Jieshi bandit gang, wanted to "take five years as a period" to fight our victorious Chinese people to the end, arrogantly attempting to achieve his "victory," which is the "restoration" of the Jiang Jieshi bandit gang on the Chinese mainland!

This set of counter-revolutionary activities by Hu Feng is organized, has strategies and tactics, and has a systematic program and various base and vicious methods. Hu Feng and his small group of lackeys not only used "theories" such as "subjective fighting spirit" and "creations" such as "time has begun" to oppose Marxism, conduct "digging-heart wars" against the people, confront the Party and the Party's literary and art policy, and slander the people, slander reality, and slander the revolution; they not only exhausted all vicious words to slander and curse the Party and the Party's leadership, slander and curse Party-member writers and non-Party writers; but also hung a poisonous false signboard of "revolution," established strongholds, stole documents, and inquired about information in our Party, revolutionary organs, and revolutionary people's organizations, in order to carry out their counter-revolutionary activities. Hu Feng deeply knew that fortresses are most easily broken from within; therefore, these sinful activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, hidden within our revolutionary camp, are extremely terrible and extremely dangerous.

Can we revolutionary people allow the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to continue to act recklessly within our revolutionary camp? No! Absolutely not!

Can we allow Hu Feng, this great traitor, to "feign death," to "seek rebirth in endurance," so that he can organically "sharpen" his "sword," "observe the direction" and then attack us? No! Absolutely not!

We must severely punish the counter-revolutionary head Hu Feng according to the law! We must liquidate the counter-revolutionary clique Hu Feng faction according to the law! During the period of our people's suppression of counter-revolutionaries, they slipped through the net and got away with it; in the past political movements, they not only did not repent and confess their counter-revolutionary truth and origins, but instead recklessly and increasingly confronted and undermined these movements. Hu Feng is a deadly enemy of the people! He even shouted madly like his actual master, the bandit chief Jiang Jieshi: As long as he "sees the right time," he is "willing to cut off" his "head and throw it out," "coexisting with the battleground," to stubbornly resist the Chinese revolutionary people to the end!

We fully agree with and support the revolutionary stance taken by the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association at the joint expanded meeting on the Hu Feng issue, and the five resolutions passed by the entire body!

Drive the counter-revolutionary chief culprit Hu Feng out of the revolutionary ranks, and demand that the state legal organs severely punish Hu Feng according to the law!

At the same time, we must continue to expose and thoroughly liquidate the Hu Feng faction! There is only one way out for all members of the Hu Feng faction, which is to surrender to the people!

Resolutely Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique

Xu Xingzhi

After the "People's Daily" successively exposed the materials of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, Hu Feng's disguised, insidious, and fierce face was revealed in its true form.

Hu Feng, this vicious wolf who has run rampant in the Chinese literary world for twenty years, is just like the "hypocrite" described in Molière's play. He pretends to be like a saint, wearing the cloak of Marxism, and appears to be a martyr in the literary world, "taking the world as his responsibility." In reality, however, he is the ugliest face, a crazy individualistic ambitious person with "everything complete in me," a schemer who "wraps insults in smiles" and "shakes hands and makes peace" with others, and a fierce executioner who uses whips "wrapped in rubber-coated steel" to brutally beat "prisoners" in the literary and art circles.

Since liberation, Hu Feng and his reactionary clique have never stopped attacking the Party. Hu Feng directed his followers to scatter in major cities, establish strongholds, break into the Party to steal Party documents, inquire about information, and infiltrate cultural institutions and revolutionary organizations to open up positions. Even after the attack failed, he was still directing his followers to retreat with the intention of "seeking rebirth in endurance," temporarily enduring for the sake of his counter-revolutionary "cause," and for his schemes of a "more distant future," waiting for the opportunity to come and make a comeback.

The enemy will never be willing to die. Look! Hu Feng declared:

"I am sharpening my sword, observing the direction, and when I see the right time, I am willing to cut off my head and throw it out to shatter that dirty, smelly iron wall." It can be seen that his "self-criticism" is entirely a trick. A fanatical enemy will never surrender casually.

Hu Feng's open and consistent anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes for twenty years have made him a degenerate of the Chinese progressive literary world and a public enemy of the people. He is no longer worthy of being called a literary and art worker, and his ugly ideological quality is not enough to educate the people. The people will abandon him, just like abandoning a traitor to the motherland. His reactionary crimes have insulted the glorious title of "engineer of the human soul."

Therefore, I fully support the resolutions of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association: to remove Hu Feng from all positions he holds and expel him from membership, to suggest that the National People's Congress revoke his qualification as a people's representative in accordance with the law, and to suggest to the Supreme People's Procuratorate that legal sanctions be imposed on Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes. These solemn resolutions represent the will of the people. Hu Feng is no longer a friend, but a spy lurking on the Chinese mainland engaged in subversive activities, an enemy who has been in long-term opposition to the Party, the people, and the literary and art circles.

We should heighten our vigilance and resolutely and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary criminal activities of the Hu Feng clique, otherwise, it will bring serious damage to the Party, the people, and the literary and art circles. We must always remember Gorky's words:

"If the enemy does not surrender, destroy it!"

Clean Hu Feng Out of the Revolutionary Ranks

Zhu Zhaoxue, Yang Kuanlin, Zhang Bo, Zhang Kaiji, Yang Xiliu, Zhao Dongri, Chen Zhanxiang, Gu Pengcheng, Hua Lanhong, Chief Engineers of the Beijing Municipal Architectural Engineering Bureau Design Institute

We are architectural design workers from the Beijing Municipal Design Institute. We are very angry after seeing the series of crimes of the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng successively exposed in the recent newspapers.

The materials exposed in the newspapers powerfully prove that Hu Feng is a consistent anti-Party and anti-people enemy hidden in the revolutionary ranks. Wearing the cloak of Marxism, he organized his clique, systematically adopted various means, and madly attacked the Party and the people, attempting to carry out sabotage within the revolutionary ranks in order to realize his counter-revolutionary conspiracy. Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes have made us further realize the sharpness and complexity of class struggle during the transition period, and realize that the enemy is plotting against us from all corners at all times. We must stand firm and heighten our vigilance.

We architectural science workers should not only receive profound education from exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, but also actively participate in thoroughly liquidating the counter-revolutionary behavior of the Hu Feng clique together with the people of the whole country. We fully support the resolutions of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association. We demand that Hu Feng be immediately cleaned out of the revolutionary ranks. We unanimously suggest that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress revoke Hu Feng's qualification as a representative of the National People's Congress in accordance with Article 38 of the Constitution. All members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique should expose Hu Feng and actively help the Party to thoroughly clarify the issue. This is their only way out.

We now deeply realize that we should strengthen political study, conscientiously carry out ideological remolding, and resolutely wage unremitting struggle against bourgeois idealism, and never allow any enemy to undermine our socialist construction cause.

Hu Feng, the Counter-Revolutionary Two-Faced Man, is the Party's Mortal Enemy

Yao Wenyuan

After reading the second batch of materials published in the "People's Daily," the fire of hatred burned my blood hot. The criminal aims of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, their conspiracy to subvert the people's democratic regime and restore the counter-revolutionary regime, are now nakedly and completely exposed.

The Hu Feng anti-Party clique systematically broke into the Party to carry out sabotage and assassination activities. The so-called "What we are dealing with now are not 'enemies,' but 'leaders'!" indicates that he knew that the US-Chiang reactionaries had already lost political power and the Communist Party had seized political power. To undermine the revolutionary cause and serve Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary conspiracy, it is first necessary to undermine the Communist Party, and the best way to undermine the Party is to sneak into the interior to carry out sabotage. The so-called "tactic of Sun Wukong sneaking into the belly" is the most naked portrayal of this kind of conspiracy to sabotage. Under Hu Feng's continuous conspiracy arrangements, many members of his counter-revolutionary clique sneaked into the Party to carry out various sabotage activities according to Hu Feng's instructions. They wore the cloak of Communist Party members, but were actually henchmen of Hu Feng's party.

What a dangerous conspiracy this is! If the Party Central Committee had not resolutely launched this struggle, how much harm would these Hu Feng clique elements lurking in the Party cause to our Party and the revolutionary cause! Peng Baishan, he had already climbed to the position of Deputy Minister of the Culture Department of the former East China Military and Political Committee and to the position of Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. Hu Feng wanted to use him to open up positions, and attempted to use him and Liu Xuewei to "hold up" East China and Shanghai, all the way to resisting the "above" - the Party Central Committee! Peng Baishan also attempted to let Hu Feng "help with East China and stay in Shanghai," so that Hu Feng could directly seize the administrative leadership of the cultural cause in the East China region. How poisonous this conspiracy is! Liu Xuewei controlled the New Literature and Art Publishing House and sent batches of core members into it. And Lu Dian actually repeatedly stole secret Party documents for Hu Feng time and time again. How much loss our Party has suffered is inestimable!

Writing to this point, I want to say once again: The Hu Feng anti-Party clique is an extremely despicable two-faced man! I remember that Peng Baishan also hypocritically gave a report criticizing Hu Feng in Shanghai. He also wrote articles criticizing Hu Feng, indicating that he had long had "contradictions" with Hu Feng. Some people feel surprised that Peng Baishan is actually a member of the Hu Feng clique. In fact, there is nothing strange about this at all. Class struggle is a life-and-death struggle, and the enemy will of course use all means to undermine the Communist Party.

I demand that all the conspiracy activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique be thoroughly investigated.

I demand that the mortal enemy of the Party - the chief culprit of the counter-revolutionary clique, Hu Feng - be punished according to the law!

    坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    彻底地揭穿胡风的政治面目
    以群
    十几年来，我是曾经长期地和胡风接触、并感觉到长期地被胡风“用微笑包着侮蔑”来对待的文艺工作者之一，但是，我一直还把他当作进步的文艺工作中的朋友。我也曾经长期地听过和读过胡风反对“公式主义”和“客观主义”的论调，并且长期地和他作过一些口头和笔下的争论，但是，我始终还只看作是文艺见解上的纷歧。今天，对照地看了“人民日报”所揭发的两批材料，才如梦初醒地认识到胡风一贯地敌视党、敌视党领导下的文艺工作者的真实面貌。我们对于这个敌人实在太缺乏警惕性了！我们从来没有想到：胡风是那么长期地在“考虑作法”，“加强实力”，“抱着与阵地共存亡的决心”，以“集束手榴弹的战术”，“再接再厉”地对党所领导的文艺工作打“冲锋”，而且是企图“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”，来打党领导下的文艺工作者，以便“打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”。
    在胡风给舒芜的密信中所提到的“时代”情势，大部分我也是亲历其境的，而且，我自己也参加在胡风所指的“豪绅们”、“市侩们”、“公子们”的行列里，回想当时的情况，对照胡风的计谋，真感到无限愤慨！在解放前的那些时日里，在国民党反动派的残酷压迫下，党所领导的文艺工作是异常艰苦的，一方面要团结进步的和中间的文艺工作者，结成一条坚持抗战、反对妥协，争取民主、反对独裁，坚持团结、反对分裂的文艺战线；一方面又要反对国民党反动派的统制、迫害，开展进步的文艺运动。而在那长时间的艰难阶段里，胡风所公开做的是些什么“工作”呢？
    他讽刺“要创作从一种思想出发”、认为“思想才是无价之宝”的文艺工作的方向，痛骂这是“把思想概念当作一面大旗，插在头上就可以吓软读者底膝盖”；他指“要作家写光明、写正面的人物”的主张〔注〕“是捏死文艺”，是“要作家说谎”，是“想杀死现实主义的精神”；他认为“附加在”作品里面的“思想”是“疲乏透了的小市民底敷衍人生的常识”；他辱骂这些人都是“以贩卖公式为生的市侩们”。
    他打起“反对客观主义”的招牌，指茅盾，沙汀等进步作家是“生活随遇而安”、“热情衰落”、是“对于生活的追随的态度”。
    他依仗“现实主义的传统”的幌子，打击在抗战初期以大鼓词、歌曲、章回小说等旧形式来表现抗战的内容，轻蔑地指为是“迎合现象”，只能得到“接受落后意识以及落后形式底歪曲作用”。并且笼统地抹杀文艺通俗化工作的意义，认为是“对于生活的卖笑的态度”；指“读者或观众愈多，工作意义就愈大”的看法是“投合”“各种新旧小市民底嗜好”的、“只问目的、不择手段”的、“抗战或革命的滑稽的悲剧。”
    他以“现实主义”的卫道者的姿态，指坚持文艺上的统一战线的主张是“用抽象的爱国主义纵容、包庇、甚至鼓励一切虚伪的甚至堕落的文艺现象”，是“歧视甚至敌视现实主义的努力”。
    他张牙舞爪地公然宣扬：“我敢用超阶级的人格说话”，以最横暴的态度骂倒进步的文艺界的一切，无耻地抬高自己及其小集团的地位。
    而另一方面，在敌我斗争如此尖锐的长时间里，我们却从没有看到：胡风曾以片段的文章抨击过张道藩、李辰冬、王平陵等国民党反动派的爪牙们的“文艺工作”。
    对于胡风及其集团长期间所进行的这一切“工作”，我们以及许多读者一直没有从正面认识他的政治面目。今天，看了他的这一极小部分的密信，才初步地认识了他的绝不“超阶级的人格”，才开始看出了他的“以天下为己任”、“万物皆备于我”的荒谬的野心和“一个大的意志贯穿了中国”的狂妄的企图！
    我们要更进一步地、彻底地揭穿胡风的政治面目！
    〔注〕：见胡风的“现实主义在今天”，发表于一九四四年一月一日的重庆“时事新报”。那时，毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”已在重庆“新华日报”上发表。
    严惩胡风，清算胡风反党集团
    贾霁
    胡风是什么样的一个人？胡风集团多年来所进行的是一套什么活动？在他那臭名远扬的“对文艺问题的意见”里已经露出他的狐狸尾巴；而他那些给他的喽啰们的秘密信，更证实了：胡风是穷凶极恶的反革命黑帮头目，胡风集团多年来一直在进行反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋活动！
    最令人气愤、最令人触目惊心的是：胡风反革命集团的阴谋活动，一直是用托洛斯基、布哈林那样匪徒的两面派方式在我国人民革命阵营内部来进行的。在我国人民解放战争紧张进行的时候，胡风派人到国民党反动报刊，和蒋匪帮配合起来进攻我们党和人民；在我国人民解放战争胜利之后，胡风还要更沉着、更用力地来破坏这个胜利。胡风像蒋介石匪帮一样的口吻，要“以五年为期”来和我们胜利了的中国人民作战到底，狂妄地企图取得他的“胜利”，也就是蒋介石匪帮在我国大陆上的“复辟”！
    胡风这一套反革命活动，是有组织的、有战略、策略的，有系统的纲领和各种各样卑劣狠毒的方法的。胡风及其一小撮喽啰不但用什么“主观战斗精神”之类的“理论”和“时间开始了”一类的“创作”来反对马克思主义、对人民来进行“挖心战”，来对抗党和党的文艺方针，来污蔑人民、污蔑现实、污蔑革命；不但用尽了一切恶毒的字眼来污蔑和咒骂党和党的领导、污蔑和咒骂党员作家和党外作家；而且毒辣地挂着“革命”的假招牌，在我们党内、革命机关和革命人民团体内，建立据点、偷窃文件、探听情况，以进行他们的反革命活动。胡风是深深知道堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的；所以，暗藏在我们革命阵营内部的胡风反革命集团这些罪恶活动是异常可怕、异常危险的。
    我们革命人民能容许胡风反革命集团继续混在我们革命阵营内部为非作歹么？不能！绝对不能！
    我们能容许胡风这巨奸头目来一个“装死”，去“在忍受中求得重生”，以便有机“磨”他的
  “剑”，“窥测方向”再向我们进攻么？不能！绝对不能！
    我们必须依法严惩反革命头目胡风！我们必须依法清算反革命集团胡风派！在我国人民镇压反革命的时期，他们却漏了网，逍遥法外；在历次政治运动中，他们不但不悔悟和交代出他们反革命真相和来历，反而肆无忌惮地和变本加厉地对抗和破坏这些运动。胡风，这是一个人民的死敌！他甚至像他的实际上的主子蒋介石匪首一样狂叫：只要到他“看准了的时候”，他“愿意割下”他的“头颅抛掷出去”，“与阵地共存亡”，来和中国革命人民顽抗到底！
    我们完全同意和拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议上对胡风问题所采取的革命立场和经全体通过的五项决议！
    把反革命首恶分子胡风赶出革命队伍，并要求国家法律机关依法严惩胡风！
    同时，我们要继续揭露和彻底清算胡风派！所有胡风派的分子只有一条出路，就是向人民缴械投降！
    坚决粉碎胡风反革命集团
    许幸之
    “人民日报”连续揭发了胡风反党集团的材料以后，胡风这个化过妆的阴险凶狠的嘴脸就原形毕露了。
    胡风，这个二十年来横行在中国文坛上的恶毒狼，真像莫利哀剧本里所描写过的“伪君子”一模一样，他伪装得如像圣人，披着马克思主义的外衣，俨然以文坛的殉道者自居，“以天下为己任”。而其实，他却是最丑恶的嘴脸，“万物皆备于我”的疯狂的个人主义野心家，“用微笑包着侮蔑”和别人“握手言欢”的阴谋家，用“橡皮包着钢丝”的鞭子毒打文艺界“囚徒”的凶狠的刽子手。
    解放以后，胡风和他的反动集团一刻也没有停止过向党进攻。胡风指挥他的党羽散布在各大城市，建立据点，打进党内窃取党内文件，探听情报，混进文化机关和革命团体，从事开辟阵地。甚至在进攻失败后还在指挥他的党羽要“在忍受中求得重生”地进行退却，为了他的反革命的“事业”，为了他的“更远大的未来”的阴谋诡计，暂时忍耐，以待时机一到，卷土重来。
    敌人是绝不甘心死亡的。看吧！胡风宣布：
  “我在磨我的剑，窥测方向，到我看准了的时候，我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去，把那个脏臭的铁壁击碎的。”可见他的“自我批判”完全是一种花招，疯狂的敌人，绝不会随便缴械投降的。
    像胡风这样明目张胆地、二十年来一贯地反党反人民、反革命的罪行，已经成了中国进步文坛的败类，人民的公敌。他已不配称为一个文艺工作者，他的丑恶的思想品质已不足以教育人民，人民将会唾弃他，亦如唾弃一个祖国的叛徒一样。他的反动的罪行，已经侮辱了“人类灵魂工程师”的光荣的称号。
    因此，我完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议：撤销胡风所担任的一切职务并开除他的会籍，建议全国人民代表大会依法撤销他人民代表的资格，并向最高人民检察院建议对胡风反革命罪行加以法律制裁等几项决议。这些庄严的决议，表现了人民的意志。胡风已经不是什么朋友，而是潜伏在中国大陆上从事于颠覆活动的坐探，是同党、同人民、同文艺界长期为敌的敌人。
    我们应当提高警惕，坚决而彻底地粉碎胡风集团的反革命的罪恶活动，否则，将会对党、对人民、对文艺界带来严重的损害。我们必须时刻记住高尔基的话：
    “敌人不投降，就消灭它！”
    把胡风从革命队伍中清洗出去
    北京市建筑工程局设计院总工程师  朱兆雪　杨宽麟　张镈  张开济  杨锡镠　赵冬日  陈占祥　顾鹏程　华揽洪
    我们是北京市设计院的建筑设计工作者。看到最近报纸上陆续揭发的反革命分子胡风的一系列罪行，我们非常愤怒。
    报纸上所揭露的材料，很有力地证明了胡风是暗藏在革命队伍中一贯反党反人民的敌人。他披着马克思主义的外衣，组织他的集团，有计划地采取了各种手段，丧心病狂地向党向人民进攻，妄想在革命队伍内部进行破坏，来实现他反革命的阴谋。胡风反党反人民反革命的罪恶，使我们更进一步认识了过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性，认识了敌人无时无刻不在从各个角落来暗算我们，我们必须站稳立场，提高警惕。
    我们建筑科学工作者，不但应从揭露胡风反革命集团中受到深刻教育，而且要和全国人民一道积极参加彻底清算胡风集团的反革命行为。我们完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议。我们要求立刻把胡风从革命队伍中清洗出去。我们一致建议全国人民代表大会常务委员会，根据宪法第三十八条的规定，撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格。胡风反革命集团所有成员应该揭露胡风，积极帮助党把问题彻底弄清，这才是他们的唯一出路。
    我们现在深刻认识到应该加强政治学习，认真地进行思想改造，坚决和资产阶级唯心主义作不懈的斗争，绝不让任何一个敌人来破坏我们的社会主义建设事业。
    胡风反革命两面派是党的死敌
    姚文元
    看了“人民日报”公布的第二批材料后，愤恨的烈火把我的血液烧得滚烫。胡风反革命集团的罪恶目的，他们企图颠覆人民民主政权和使反革命政权复辟的阴谋，现在是赤裸裸完全暴露出来了。
    胡风反党集团有计划地打入党内进行破坏暗害活动，所谓“现在所对的并不是‘敌人’，而且都是‘领导者’呀！”，就表示他知道美蒋反动派已经失去了政权而共产党掌握了政权，要破坏革命事业替蒋介石反革命阴谋服务，就首先要破坏共产党，而破坏党的最好办法，就是钻进内部来进行破坏，所谓“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”就是这种阴谋破坏最露骨的写照。在胡风不断的阴谋布置之下，他的反革命集团的许多成员都钻进党内来，执行胡风指示干着各种破坏活动。他们披着共产党员的外衣，而实际上是胡风党的党羽。
    这是多么危险的阴谋呀！如果不是党中央坚决展开这一斗争，这些潜伏在党内的胡风集团分子要给我们党和革命事业造成多么大的危害！彭柏山，他已经爬到前华东军政委员会文化部副部长、爬到上海市委宣传部长的位置上去了，胡风要通过他来开辟岗位，企图通过他和刘雪苇来“顶住”华东和上海，一直到对抗“上面”——党中央！彭柏山还企图让胡风“帮弄华东，留在上海”，使胡风能直接攫取华东地区文化事业的行政领导权，这阴谋多么毒呀！刘雪苇把持着新文艺出版社，把一批批骨干分子送进去。而芦甸竟至一次次不断地为胡风盗窃党内秘密文件，我们党受到了多少损失是无法估计的！
    写到这里，我要再一次的说：胡风反党集团是极端卑鄙的两面派！我记得，彭柏山在上海还假惺惺地做过批判胡风的报告，他还写文章批判胡风，表示他早就和胡风有“矛盾”。有人觉得吃惊，彭柏山竟是胡风集团分子。其实这根本没有什么奇怪的。阶级斗争就是你死我活的斗争，敌人当然要用尽一切方法来破坏共产党的。
    我要求把胡风反党集团全部阴谋活动彻底追查清楚。
    我要求对党的死敌——反革命集团首恶分子胡风依法予以惩办！
