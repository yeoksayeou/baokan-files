    The Hearts of the People Are With the Asian-African Conference
    —Asian-African Conference Diary 　Li Shenzhi, Zhang Yan
    (Continued from yesterday)
      The Asian-African Conference closed
    Sunday, April 24

    Early in the morning, you could feel that the atmosphere in Bandung was somewhat special today.
    Not only in Independence Building, not only in the Merdeka Building, not only on Asia-Africa Avenue, but even in many quiet streets in the suburbs, wherever the delegation's car passed, there were groups of people.
    Yesterday's news definitely stated: The Asian-African Conference will close today. The prime ministers of the five initiating countries have sent invitations to all delegations, inviting them to attend the banquet held at the Homann Hotel in the evening to celebrate the closing of the Asian-African Conference.
    From the crowds standing or walking everywhere, you could see the joy that people could not suppress in their hearts.
    The mood in the press room today was also pleasant. Reporters continued to inquire about the speech of the head of the Chinese delegation at yesterday's political committee meeting, hoping to know as much as possible about this unpublished speech.
  A central topic of discussion was the statement made by Premier Zhou Enlai yesterday afternoon. Throughout the morning, the reactions from Jakarta, Yangon, New Delhi... and even London and Paris were almost uniformly welcoming.
    Near its end, the Asian-African Conference brought more confidence and hope for peace.
    In the Merdeka Building, the reporters' attention today shifted from downstairs to upstairs. From eight o'clock in the morning, the Colonialism Issues Group and the "World Peace and Cooperation Issues" Group were meeting there. Everyone knew that these two groups were discussing the main issues hindering the progress of the conference. In addition, everyone also saw that the heads of some delegations personally participated in the "World Peace and Cooperation Issues" Group, including Zhou Enlai of China, Nasser of Egypt, Prince Wan Waithayakon of Thailand, Zorlu of Turkey...
    The Heads of Delegation Meeting continued at nine o'clock, but it adjourned shortly after the meeting, needing to wait for the results of the two group discussions.
    Chairman Sastroamidjojo, who was presiding over the Heads of Delegation Meeting, went upstairs to the two conference rooms every now and then to take a look.
    However, noon arrived, and the people attending the Heads of Delegation Meeting all went back to eat, but the doors of the two conference rooms upstairs remained
  motionless.
      It was not until 1:30 in the afternoon that representatives were seen coming out, but instead of returning to their villas or hotels as usual, they went to the bar for refreshments. And soon they returned to the conference rooms.
    After another while, the representatives of the "Colonialism Issues" group withdrew, but the disputed issues were not resolved, but were transferred to the "World Peace and Cooperation Issues" group for joint discussion.
    It can be guessed that the work of this group was extremely intense, and huge efforts were still needed to reach an agreement.
    The scheduled time for the closing meeting was getting closer and closer, and people's moods were also getting a little nervous: Could these obstacles really not be overcome until the last five minutes?
    It was almost three o'clock, and we had to rush to Independence Building, as news said that the press seats there were almost full.
    The situation in front of Independence Building today was also a little different, with so many people that they seemed piled up. Most of them had been waiting here since early in the morning.
    Hour after hour passed. The guests and reporters who were originally sitting in the conference hall, like the many people crowded at the door of Independence Building and across the street, stood on tiptoe to look.
    Three o'clock passed, four o'clock passed, five o'clock passed, and still there was no sign of the delegations.
    People did not lose patience. News from the Merdeka Building said: The Heads of Delegation Meeting had resumed from four o'clock, finalizing the final communiqué of the conference.
    The deadlock was finally broken in the last five minutes.
    When the "World Peace and Cooperation Issues" group finished its work, an agreement was reached on the issue of colonialism: "Declaring that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil that should be eradicated quickly;... declaring that the conference supports the cause of freedom and independence of all such peoples; demanding that the countries concerned grant such peoples freedom and independence."
    The conference finally rejected the kind of insinuation: the so-called "all forms of colonialism," the so-called "international doctrines of infiltration and subversion."
    After all, there can only be one kind of colonialism, and we can only oppose the colonialism that all the people of Asia and Africa have suffered, understood, and have been oppressing and tormenting them for hundreds of years.
    The "World Peace and Cooperation Issues" group also reached a consensus on the issue of military blocs: "Not using collective defense arrangements to serve the special interests of any major power; no country should put pressure on other countries."
      Disputes and differences have been overcome. The common wishes and demands of the Asian and African people, and the public opinion of the Asian and African people, finally proved to be overwhelming.
      From the fragments of the resolutions that have been revealed in the past few days, people already know that the final communiqué, which will be adopted at the plenary meeting immediately, will declare to the world the position of Asian and African countries against colonialism and safeguarding national independence, against racism, and advocating basic human rights and the principle of national self-determination; and declare the desire of Asian and African countries to develop economic and cultural cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
      Now, there is also news that the resolution on world peace and cooperation has been written into a "Declaration on Promoting World Peace and Cooperation" containing ten principles, which embodies and develops the content of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This is a major achievement of the conference today.
      Finally, news from the Merdeka Building said: The Heads of Delegation Meeting also adopted an important proposal from the Chinese delegation, "The Asian-African Conference recommends that the five initiating countries, in consultation with the participating countries, consider convening the next session of the Asian-African Conference."
      It is said that a situation that has never happened before has appeared in Conference Room No. 2. From outside the door, one can often hear bursts of applause.
    Inside and outside Independence Building, people are waiting with increasingly strong hope.
    The sun is slowly setting, and the clock points to six o'clock. The Bandung Boy Scouts have slowly lowered the national flags of the twenty-nine countries. The weather suddenly changed again, and a sudden rain began to fall in the air. The crowd that had been standing in the sun all day hardly moved, letting the wind blow on them and the rain pour on them.
    At this moment, the sound of sirens roared from far to near. Delegations from various countries came from the Merdeka Building.
    The sound of cheers immediately drowned out the screams of the sirens.
    At 6:35, the last plenary meeting of the Asian-African Conference began.
    The chairman first asked the secretary-general to read out the final communiqué of the Asian-African Conference.
    The first document in history issued in the name of twenty-nine countries in Asia and Africa was in the storm of long and unceasing applause, was unanimously
  passed.
    Then, the representatives of various countries spoke in alphabetical order of the country names. They are representatives from Afghanistan, Burma, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and South Vietnam.
    A few days ago, when these representatives spoke at the opening meeting, people heard all kinds of different voices, and today, all the representatives emphasized the achievements of the conference, the significance of the consensus reached at the conference, and the contributions made by the conference to strengthening the friendship between the Asian and African people and world peace.
    When each representative finished speaking, applause rang out simultaneously inside and outside the venue.
    Regarding this conference, the head of the Chinese delegation said this: "Our conference is a success.... The achievement of the conference is that it has begun or enhanced the understanding between Asian and African countries, and has reached agreements on certain major issues, which will be of great help to us in the common tasks of opposing colonialism, upholding world peace, and promoting friendly cooperation with each other."
    Chairman Ali Sastroamidjojo delivered the closing speech at the end. He said: "The Asian and African peoples have shown that we are capable of cooperation, and what we need is peace, overwhelming peace, for the benefit of our people and the whole world."
    He concluded: "In these days, many friendships have been established and many beneficial contacts have been made. Now we ourselves know that we need to be tolerant and live in peace with each other like friendly neighbors, and this is the only reliable and true foundation on which mankind can prosper. May we continue to advance on the path we have jointly taken, and may the Bandung Conference be a beacon guiding the progressive future of Asia and Africa."
    The conference closed at 9:30 in the evening.
    However, looking at the jubilant crowd on Asia-Africa Avenue under the fluorescent lights, no one remembered that it was night.
    Looking out from Independence Building, all around were people, even the windows of the buildings and the concrete awnings in front of the shops were full of people.
    Countless hands were waving, countless mouths were cheering.
    The wind was still blowing, and the rain was still falling. But no one paid any attention. The raindrops shone in the lights, and looked like confetti sprinkled for the festival.
    Zhou Enlai, Nehru, U Nu, Sastroamidjojo, Nasser and representatives from many other countries, who came out of the venue, stood on the stone steps in the center of Independence Building and waved to the people. The people rushed over to cheer.
    Five minutes, ten minutes... Ah, these are countless moments.
    When the representatives went to the Homann Hotel to attend the celebration banquet, the car slowly crawled forward in the aisle of people, looking from a distance as if it was being lifted by countless hands.
    It was not until after eleven o'clock, after the banquet at the Homann Hotel ended, and after every delegation was sent off, that the people on Asia-Africa Avenue slowly dispersed.
    The people of Bandung are immersed in joy tonight.
    From Beijing to Delhi, from Yangon to Cairo, from Tokyo to Monrovia, every honest person who is waiting for news from Bandung tonight will feel the same joy as the people of Bandung.
    The Asians and Africans who were once divided, isolated, insulted, and harmed have now issued a united voice. This is the first time in history. The conference has successfully concluded. (To be continued)

    人民的心同亚非会议在一起
    ——亚非会议日记 　李慎之  张彦
    （续昨）
      亚非会议闭幕了
    四月二十四日星期日
    一早就可以感到万隆的气氛今天有些特殊。
    不但是在独立大厦，不但是在红白旗大厦，也不但是在亚非大街，甚至是在郊区许多僻静的街道上，只要是有代表团的汽车经过的地方，都是一群一群的人。
    昨天的消息肯定地说：亚非会议要在今天闭幕。五个发起国家的总理已经给所有的代表团发出了请帖，邀请他们参加晚上在豪曼饭店举行的宴会，庆祝亚非会议闭幕。
    从到处站着的或者走着的人群上可以看到人们心里按捺不住的喜悦。
    记者室里今天的情绪也是愉快的。记者们继续在打听中国代表团团长在昨天政治委员会会议上的发言，希望知道这篇没有公开发表的发言尽可能多的内容。
  人们谈论的一个中心是周恩来总理昨天午后发表的声明。整个上午，从雅加达，从仰光，从新德里……乃至从伦敦和巴黎来的反应几乎是一致表示欢迎的。
    在临近结束的时候，亚非会议给和平带来了更多的信心和希望。
    在红白旗大厦，记者们今天的注意从楼下转到了楼上。从早晨八点钟起，殖民主义问题小组和“世界和平和合作问题”小组就在那里开会。大家都知道，在这两个小组里，讨论着阻碍会议前进的主要问题。此外大家还看见，有些代表团的团长亲自参加了“世界和平和合作问题”的小组，包括中国的周恩来，埃及的纳赛尔，泰国的旺亲王，土耳其的佐鲁……。
    代表团团长会议还是在九点继续开会，但是开会以后不久就宣告休息了，它需要等待两个小组讨论的结果。
    主持代表团团长会议的沙斯特罗阿米佐约主席每过一会，就到楼上两个会议室去张望一下。
    然而，中午到了，参加代表团团长会议的人们都回去吃饭了，楼上两个会议室的门口却还是不见
  动静。
      一直到午后一点半钟，才看见里面的代表出来，但是，他们不是像平常一样回到别墅或者旅馆去，而是到酒吧间去吃点心。而且，很快就又回到了会议室里。
    又过了一阵，“殖民主义问题”小组的代表们退出来了，但是争论中的问题并没有解决，而是被转交到了“世界和平和合作问题”小组去一并讨论。
    可以猜想，这个小组的工作是极其紧张的，为了达成协议，还需要作巨大的努力。
    预定闭幕会议开会的时候越来越近了，人们的心情也越来越有点紧张起来：难道这些障碍真的到最后五分钟还无法克服么？
    快到三点钟了，我们不能不赶到独立大厦去，有消息说，那里的记者席已经快坐满了。
    独立大厦前面，今天的情形也有些两样，人多到像堆起来的一样，他们大多是一早就守在这里的。
    一个钟头又一个钟头过去，原来坐在会议厅里的来宾和记者们同许多挤在独立大厦的门口，和街对面的群众一样，踮起脚趾头望。
    三点钟过了，四点钟过了，五点钟过了，仍然没有代表团的踪影。
    人们并没有失去耐心。从红白旗大厦来的消息说：代表团团长会议已经从四点钟起复会，在通过会议的最后公报了。
    僵局终于在最后五分钟打破了。
    在“世界和平和合作问题”小组结束工作的时候，对殖民主义问题达成了这样的协议：“宣布殖民主义在其一切表现中都是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害；……宣布会议支持所有这种人民的自由和独立的事业；要求有关国家给予这种人民以自由和独立。”
    会议终于拒绝了那种含沙射影的说法：所谓“一切形式的殖民主义”，所谓“渗透和颠覆性的国际学说”。
    毕竟只能有一种殖民主义，只能反对所有亚洲和非洲的人民都受过，都懂得，几百年来一直压迫着，折磨着他们的殖民主义。
    “世界和平和合作问题”小组对军事集团的问题也得出了一致的看法：“不使用集体防御的安排来为任何一个大国的特殊利益服务；任何国家不对其他国家施加压力”。
      争论和分歧已经克服了。亚非人民的共同愿望和要求，亚非人民的公是公非最后证明是压倒一切的东西。
      从几天以来陆续透露的片段取得了协议的决议中，人们已经知道，马上将在全体会议通过的最后公报，将向全世界宣告亚非国家反对殖民主义，维护民族独立的立场，反对种族主义，主张基本人权和民族自决原则的立场；宣告亚非国家对于在平等互利的基础上发展经济和文化合作的愿望。
      现在，又有消息说，关于世界和平和合作的决议已经写成了包含十项原则的“关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言”，这十项原则体现并且发展了和平共处的五项原则的内容。这是会议在今天的一个重大收获。
      最后从红白旗大厦来的消息说：代表团团长会议又采纳了中国代表团的一个重要提案，“亚非会议建议五个发起国在同与会国协商之下，考虑召开亚非会议下届会议的问题”。
      据说，在第二号会议室内出现了一种从来没有过的情况。在门外常常可以听到门里一阵又一阵的掌声。
    独立大厦里里外外，人们带着越来越强烈的希望在等待着。
    太阳慢慢暗下去，时针指到六点，万隆的童子军已经把二十九国的国旗慢慢降下。天气突然又变了，空中洒起骤雨来。已经在太阳底下站了一天的人群几乎连动都没有动一动，任凭风吹在身上，雨淌在身上。
    就在这个时候，警笛呼啸的声音自远而近。各国代表团从红白旗大厦过来了。
    欢呼的声音马上淹没了警笛的尖叫。
    六点三十五分，亚非会议最后的一次全体会议开始了。
    主席首先请秘书长宣读亚非会议的最后公报。
    历史上第一次以亚洲，非洲二十九个国家的名义发出的文件在暴风雨般久久不息的掌声中被全体
  一致通过了。
    接着是各国代表按国名英文字母次序发言。他们是阿富汗、缅甸、中国、埃及、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、伊拉克、日本、老挝、黎巴嫩、利比里亚、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、苏丹、叙利亚、土耳其、越南民主共和国和南越的代表们。
    几天以前，当这些代表在开幕会议上发言的时候，人们听到各种各样不同的声音，而在今天，所有的代表都强调指出会议的成就，指出会议取得一致协议的意义，指出会议对于加强亚非人民的友谊和世界和平所作出的贡献。
    在每一个代表发言完毕的时候，会场里面和会场外面同时响起了掌声。
    对于这次会议，中国代表团团长是这样说的：“我们的会议是有成就的。………会议的成就是开始了，或者增进了亚非各国之间的了解，并在某些主要问题上达成了协议，这对于我们在反对殖民主义、拥护世界和平、增进彼此之间友好合作的共同任务上将有很大的帮助。”
    阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约主席最后致闭幕辞。他说：“亚非人民已经表明，我们是能够合作的，而我们所需要的是和平，压倒一切的、为了我们的人民和全世界的利益的和平。”
    他最后说：“在这些日子里，许多友谊已经建立，许多有益的接触已经进行。现在我们自己当中都知道，我们需要容忍和彼此像友好的邻居一样和平相处，而这是人类赖以昌盛的唯一可靠的真实的基础。愿我们在我们已经共同采取的道路上继续前进，并愿万隆会议成为指引亚洲和非洲的进步前途的灯塔。”
    会议闭幕的时候是晚上九点半钟。
    但是，看着亚非大街上在日光灯下欢腾若狂的人海，没有人记起现在是在黑夜。
    从独立大厦看出去，四围左右全是人，甚至楼房的窗口里，铺子门口水泥的遮阳上都挤满了人。
    无数的手在挥舞，无数的嘴在欢呼。
    风还在吹着，雨还在飘着。但是，谁也不去理会，雨点在灯光里发亮，看起来倒像是节日洒下的彩纸。
    从会场里走出来的周恩来、尼赫鲁、吴努、沙斯特罗阿米佐约，纳赛尔和许多其他国家的代表们站在独立大厦正中的石阶上向人们挥手，人们涌过来欢呼。
    五分钟，十分钟………。啊，这是无法计数的时刻。
    当代表们到豪曼饭店去参加庆祝宴会时，汽车在人的甬道中慢慢蠕动前进，远看像是被无数的手举过去的一样。
    一直到十一点钟以后，到豪曼饭店的宴会结束以后，到送走了每一个代表团以后，亚非大街上的人才慢慢散去。
    万隆人民今夜是沉浸在欢乐中。
    从北京到德里，从仰光到开罗，从东京到蒙罗维亚，今夜在守候着万隆消息的每一个正直的人，都将同万隆人民感到一样的欢乐。
    曾经是被分裂的、被隔绝的、被侮辱和被损害的亚洲人和非洲人，现在发出了团结一致的呼声，这在历史上是第一次。会议胜利地结束了。　（待续）
