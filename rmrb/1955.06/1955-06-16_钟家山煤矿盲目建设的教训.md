The construction of the Zhongjiashan Coal Mine, a local state-owned enterprise in Jiangxi Province, began at the end of 1953. This coal mine was built while simultaneously designing, surveying, and constructing, resulting in significant blindness and waste during the construction process.

As early as the late Qing Dynasty, farmers in the vicinity of the Zhongjiashan coalfield would gather to mine it. After liberation, the People's Government of Leping County managed it for more than a year, but was forced to shut down due to complex geological conditions, outdated equipment, and frequent accidents. In 1953, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry sent geological engineers to survey the Zhongjiashan coalfield. At that time, based solely on Kuomintang geological survey data and the distribution of old wells, they blindly concluded that there were seven coal seams, gradually increasing in thickness from top to bottom, with a total recoverable coal reserve of over 3.5 million tons, sufficient for a mine with a daily output of 700 tons to operate for fifteen years. Subsequent design and investment were based on this, and the original old wells were expanded into vertical shafts, and construction began.

The former Local Industry Bureau of the Central South Administrative Committee raised objections to the design based on this unreliable data, pointing out that the Zhongjiashan mine was located in an anticlinal zone and that the geological structure was likely to change significantly, and that drilling should be carried out first. However, the Zhongjiashan mine was eager to start construction, and there was a lack of drilling capacity at the time. This opinion was not seriously considered, and construction proceeded.

It was not until June of last year that the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry allocated a drilling rig to the Zhongjiashan mine. After drilling four holes, most of them did not find coal. Based on this data, it can be determined that there is no seventh coal seam within the originally designed coalfield area, and the other six coal seams also vary greatly, with the depth and length significantly shortened. According to the existing incomplete data, the estimated recoverable coal reserve is only about 2.5 million tons, which can only supply the mine for ten years, shortening the lifespan of the entire mine equipment by one-third.

In addition, in the design of the Zhongjiashan coal mine's auxiliary power plant, the need for safe electricity use in the mine was overlooked. Vertical shaft hoisting and power plant water pumping used direct current, while underground ventilation and working faces used alternating current. The surplus of 200 horsepower of direct current had nowhere to be used, resulting in an extra consumption of about 2,500 tons of coal per year, while alternating current was insufficient, making future ventilation, drainage, underground mining, and transportation impossible to mechanize. More seriously, direct current and alternating current could not be adjusted for use, and if any motor failed, the other motor would be forced to stop working.

The plant buildings of the mine's power plant, repair shop, and other auxiliary buildings such as bathhouses and canteens were not carefully considered for their location. It was thought that "centralizing in one place is always good," but as a result, more than 5,000 square meters of newly built buildings were built in coal-bearing areas, pressing down on more than 100,000 tons of recoverable coal, equivalent to half a year's expected coal production for the mine.

In terms of transportation, the preliminary design estimated that ten-ton civilian boats could navigate the Le'an River during the dry season, and one-hundred-ton large boats could navigate during the flood season. However, in the past two years, only small boats of about three tons can navigate during the actual dry season. There are six large shoals in the 20-kilometer-long river channel, with a total length of five kilometers. If these shoals are not dredged, the cost of coal transportation will increase by nearly 700,000 yuan per year. The state must invest about 200,000 yuan to dredge these shoals, and the regular maintenance costs will also be considerable.

These serious problems in the basic construction of the Zhongjiashan Coal Mine have attracted the attention of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee. Responsible comrades of the province have inspected the work at the mine, and the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry is also studying these problems and gradually resolving them. However, the lessons of the construction of the Zhongjiashan Coal Mine should be remembered.

The lessons of the construction of the Zhongjiashan Coal Mine illustrate that in order to do a good job in basic construction, it is necessary to resolutely oppose the practice of not attaching importance to the collection of original data, not conducting serious investigation and research, and relying solely on subjective assumptions.

    钟家山煤矿盲目建设的教训
    侯秉衡
    江西省地方国营钟家山煤矿的建设，是从一九五三年底开始的。这个煤矿是在边设计，边勘查，边施工的情况下进行的，因而建设中盲目性很大，浪费也很严重。
    远在满清末年，钟家山煤田就有附近的农民集伙开采，解放后乐平县人民政府经营一年多，终因地质复杂，设备落后，经常发生事故而被迫停办。一九五三年，江西省工业厅派地质工程师来钟家山煤田勘查，当时只根据国民党地质调查资料和古井的分布情况，盲目断定有七层煤，自上而下渐次增厚，可采煤量共有三百五十万吨以上，可供日产七百吨矿井开采十五年。以后的设计和投资就都以它作为依据，并利用原有古井扩大为竖井，破土开工了。
    原中南行政委员会地方工业局曾对根据这一不可靠的资料进行设计提过不同意见，指出钟家山矿位于背斜地带，地质构造可能变化颇大，应先设法钻探。但，钟家山矿急于要施工，当时又缺乏钻探力量，没有认真考虑这个意见，就施工了。
    直到去年六月间，江西省工业厅拨给钟家山矿一部钻机，先后打了四个钻，大都没有见矿。根据这些资料可以断定该矿原设计煤田区域内没有第七层煤，其他六层煤变化也很大，延深和延长都大大地缩短了。依据现有不完整的资料估计可采煤量仅在二百五十万吨左右，只能供该矿开采十年，这就使整个矿山设备使用寿命缩短三分之一。
    此外，在钟家山煤矿附属发电厂的设计中，又忽略了矿山安全用电的需要。竖井提升和电厂汲水用的是直流电，井下通风和工作面用交流电；直流电多余二百马力无处用，每年要多耗煤约二千五百吨，而交流电又不够用，将来通风、排水，井下采煤和运输都不能机械化。更严重的是直流电和交流电不能调剂使用，任何一部电机发生事故，另一部电机势将被迫停止工作。
    矿山的电厂、修机厂等厂房建筑，浴室、食堂等附属建筑都没有慎重考虑建筑地点，以为“集中一点总是好的”，结果新建的五千多平方公尺建筑物，都盖在含煤区内，共压住可采煤十多万吨，相当于这个矿半年的预计产煤量。
    在运输方面，初步设计中估计乐安河枯水时期能航十吨民船，洪水时期能航百吨大船。而近两年实际枯水时期只能航行三吨左右的小船。在二十多公里长的河道内就有六个大滩，共长五公里，如不疏通这些沙滩，每年将增加煤炭运输成本近七十万元。疏通这些沙滩国家必须投资二十万元左右，而且经常维护费的开支也不少。
    钟家山煤矿基本建设中的这些严重问题，已引起了中共江西省委和省人民委员会的重视，省的负责同志并到矿山检查了工作，江西省工业厅也正在研究这些问题逐步加以解决。但是，钟家山煤矿建设的教训是应该记取的。
    钟家山煤矿建设的教训，说明为了作好基本建设工作，必须坚决反对不重视原始资料的搜集工作，反对不认真进行调查研究，单凭主观推断的做法。
