    After the Suzhou Special District Rectified the Grain Unified Sales Work
    Han Peixin, Commissioner of the Commissioner's Office of Suzhou Special District, Jiangsu Province
    The Suzhou Special District is located in the Yangtze River Delta, the center of the Taihu Lake Basin, and is one of the famous high grain-producing areas in Jiangsu Province. The total grain output of the district in 1954 was 4,147,910,000 jin. In addition to the grain collected and planned to be purchased by the state, the farmers in the district retained more than 1,970 million jin of grain. Adding the 850 million jin of grain planned to be supplied to the district by the state this year, the average amount of grain per farmer in the district is more than 540 jin. From this, it can be seen that the amount of grain retained by farmers is not small. If the grain unified sales work is done well, it is entirely possible to guarantee a fair and reasonable supply.
    However, before the rectification of the unified sales work, the grain unified sales situation in the entire special district was relatively chaotic. Since February, grain sales have increased daily. In March, the district sold a total of more than 78 million jin of grain, exceeding the monthly projected target by 66.5 percent. In particular, the sales volume in Wuxi, Changshu, and other counties was even more alarming. Wuxi County actually sold 9.13 million jin in March, exceeding the monthly target by 107 percent. Changshu County's actual sales volume in March increased by 49 percent compared with the same period last year, and by 41 percent compared with the previous month. If calculated at an average supply of one jin of grain per person per day, the population supplied would account for more than 75 percent of the total population of the county. Obviously, this situation is abnormal and unreasonable.
    There are many reasons for the chaotic situation in the unified sales work; the main ones are as follows:
    First, it is due to shortcomings in the leadership work. The District Committee and the Commissioner's Office did not seriously analyze and study the rural situation after the unified purchase of grain, and lacked in-depth inspection and specific guidance on the unified sales work. Some grassroots staff members had the idea of ​​"emphasizing purchase and neglecting sales." After the unified purchase, they did not promptly and carefully verify the grain supply plan. Some, although they verified the plan, did so only based on subjective assumptions and did not involve the masses. They were ignorant of the grain unified sales situation. When they saw the masses requesting supplies, they could not distinguish the true from the false, and one-sidedly believed that the farmers were indeed short of grain. They looked upwards, reached out for grain, and responded to all requests for supplies from farmers, blindly expanding the scope of unified sales supply, which created a chaotic situation in the grain unified sales work. For example, in Xinhu Township, Taicang County, when the township staff first verified the supply plan, they issued a supply certificate to anyone who claimed to be short of grain, resulting in more than 500 households in the township needing supplies. However, after the first verification, more than 110 households requested supplies in the next two times. Finally, the supply coverage of the township reached more than 95 percent, and the supply volume reached more than 430,000 jin. Blindly expanding the supply coverage not only failed to solve the problem, but made things worse. Many people still often went out to scramble for cooked food. Those who were really short of grain expressed dissatisfaction, saying: "The government is not fair. Those who know how to be cunning take advantage."
    Second, it is due to the contradiction between the psychological habits of small-scale peasant producers and the state's planned economy. Many farmers have the idea of ​​"hoarding gold is not as good as storing grain." They have a special feeling for grain. Therefore, during the unified purchase, farmers always hope to sell less and keep more, while in the unified sales, they hope to buy more and buy earlier. Therefore, after the unified purchase, those who are short of grain want to buy grain, and those who are not short of grain also want to buy grain. Those who should buy less want to buy more, those who should buy later want to buy earlier, and those who have already bought want to buy again. For example, farmers in Zhoushu Township, Kunshan County, said after the unified purchase: "Selling grain is like marrying off a daughter, and I always feel reluctant." Therefore, some want to buy back the grain they sold during the unified sales. Some farmers in Qiaodong Township, Wuxian County, said: "Even rats have winter food, how can we just buy a little and eat it." This year, in March and April, 28 households in Tangzhuang Village in this township queued up in Suzhou every day to grab cooked food. After investigation, none of these 28 households were short of grain in April.
    Third, it is due to the rumors and sabotage of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. They seized on certain shortcomings in our work and the farmers' nervous psychology, spread rumors, incited discord, and massively acquired and grabbed grain. Some counter-revolutionaries openly incited the masses, saying: "Which family produces, which family has grain." "Whose chimney is smoking, everyone should go to that family to eat." This created a nervous psychology among some farmers. Fifty-seven rich peasant households in Qiaodong Township, Wuxian County, often went out to grab purchases; Zhou Rongkun, a rich peasant in Liguo Township (who has been arrested according to law), owed more than 2,000 jin of grain at the end of the unified purchase, and grabbed more than 1,130 jin of noodles, pancakes, and rice cakes before and after the unified purchase. Some landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries used extremely despicable means to win over and corrupt staff members. In some places, counter-revolutionaries were even found attempting to incite the masses to beat up staff members.
    In order to eliminate the chaotic phenomena in the grain unified sales work in a timely manner, the county committees and county people's governments of all counties have, since the end of March, regarded the rectification of the grain unified sales work as an important measure to stabilize the farmers' production mood and ensure the smooth progress of spring ploughing. All counties convened three-level meetings of county, district, and township staff, and thoroughly conducted ideological mobilization work related to the rectification of grain unified sales, from inside the Party to outside the Party, from staff to the masses; universally analyzed and investigated the rural grain supply situation; and, on the basis of vigorously publicizing the "Three Fixes" policy for grain, announced the grain sales targets for the second quarter by township, verified the supply plan for the entire township through democratic discussion, and finally reviewed and approved it by the higher-level government. By the end of April, the rectification of the grain unified sales work in the entire special district had achieved significant results.
    First, through extensive socialist ideological education and publicity of the state's "Three Fixes" policy for grain, the political consciousness of the cadres was raised, and the nervous psychology of the masses was eliminated. When publicizing the state's grain policy, all localities first explained the benefits of unified purchase and sales of grain to the country and the people by calculating the detailed accounts of collection, purchase, and sales, analyzing the rural situation and the ideological characteristics of farmers; and explained that the principles of supplying what should be supplied, supplying less of what should be supplied less, and not supplying what should not be supplied must be adhered to. Through the introduction of the successful experiences of the rectification of unified sales work in typical townships and villages, the resistance of grassroots staff members to the rectification of unified sales work was eliminated. Then, through them, the grain policy was widely publicized to the masses, and the emotions of the masses quickly stabilized. Some farmers said: "Hearing the policy is like putting alum in a muddy water tank, and my heart is settled." "Don't compete with the government for grain, compete with the land for grain." The production mood has greatly increased. In Fuxing Village, Dian'an Township, Changshu County, every household used to say that they were short of grain and their production was passive. After the policy was publicized, some farmers said: "These days, I really forgot about socialism. If I continue to make trouble, I will be sorry to the country." At that time, 29 farmers took out the hidden grain to dry it, and the whole village actively engaged in production.
    Second, by announcing the grain sales targets for April, May, and June, relying on and mobilizing the masses to verify the grain supply plan for the township, ensuring the supply to grain-deficient households, reducing the part that could be supplied less, and eliminating the part that should not be supplied, the unified sales work was made fair and reasonable. According to the statistics of 1,183 townships in the entire special district, the grain supply plan for the second quarter verified through mass discussion decreased by 18.5 percent compared with the original plan. The grain sales volume in the entire special district in April decreased by 5 percent compared with March. Because the masses eliminated their worries, the rural economic life gradually became active after the second quarter supply plan was verified, and the trading volume in the grain market increased daily. Farmer Wang Yongfang of Xinsheng Township, Taicang County, initially requested a supply of 170 jin of grain in June. After the grain sales target was announced, he said: "I didn't need that much originally. I just didn't understand the policy and had the idea of ​​storing grain for famine prevention. Now the government stipulates a reasonable supply. If I buy more, others will buy less." Therefore, he voluntarily reduced the supply by 135 jin.
    Third, in the process of rectifying the grain unified sales work, all localities adhered to the Party's class line in the countryside, thus raising the awareness of the poor peasants, uniting and educating the middle peasants, and stopping sabotage activities. All localities generally held symposiums for poor peasants, conducted grain unified sales policy education for them, and mastered the grain situation in the countryside through their bottoming out; and eliminated the middle peasants' resistance to grain unified sales. The poor and middle peasants were able to promptly and resolutely expose and combat the sabotage activities of rich peasants and other bad elements. According to the masses' report in Danghu Township, the People's Court of Wuxian County legally dealt with two rich peasant households that seriously undermined the unified sales policy. Some farmers who used to listen to the rumors of rich peasants and were not active in production said: "In the past, I only blamed myself for being confused and being fooled by the rich peasants, which delayed production."
    All localities have appropriately dealt with some staff members who violated laws and regulations and engaged in favoritism and malpractice, which has won the support of the masses.
    Fourth, while rectifying the rural grain unified sales work, the leadership over the urban grain unified sales work was strengthened, loopholes were plugged, malpractices were eliminated, and through publicity and education, the idea of ​​saving grain was initially established among the broad masses of urban people, so that the urban unified sales work was also improved. According to the statistics of 53 towns in the entire special district, the originally verified supply volume for the second quarter was more than 43 million jin, which was reduced to more than 39 million jin after rectification.

    苏州专区整顿粮食统销工作以后
    江苏省苏州专区专员公署专员　韩培信
    苏州专区地处长江三角洲，为太湖流域的中心，是江苏省著名的粮食高产量地区之一。全区一九五四年粮食总产量为四十一亿四千七百九十一万斤。除国家征收和计划收购的粮食而外，全区农民还留有粮食十九亿七千多万斤，加上本年度国家计划供应给本区的粮食八亿五千万斤，合计平均全区每个农民可有粮食五百四十多斤。由此可知，农民留粮并不算少，如果粮食统销工作做好了，是完全可以保证公平合理地供应的。
    但是，在整顿统销工作之前，全专区粮食统销工作情况是比较混乱的。自二月份以来，粮食销售量逐日增加，三月份全区共销售粮食七千八百多万斤，突破全月预计指标百分之六十六点五。特别是无锡、常熟等县销售量更为惊人。无锡县三月份实销九百一十三万斤，竟突破全月指标的百分之一百零七。常熟县三月份实销量较去年同期增加百分之四十九，较上月增加百分之四十一，如以每人每日平均供应一斤粮食计算，供应的人口则达全县总人口的百分之七十五以上。显然这种情况是反常的，不合理的。
    统销工作中所以存在这种混乱现象，原因是多方面的；主要的有以下几点：
    首先是由于领导工作方面的缺点。地委和专署对粮食统购后的农村情况没有认真加以分析研究，对统销工作缺乏深入检查和具体指导。部分基层工作人员存在着“重购轻销”的思想，在统购之后，没有及时认真核定好粮食供应计划，有的虽然核定了计划，但核定时只凭主观臆断，没有通过群众。他们对粮食统销情况心中无数，看到群众要求供应，不能分辩真假情况，片面认为农民确实没粮，眼睛向上，伸手要粮，对要求供应的农民一律有求必应，盲目扩大统销供应面，这样就造成了粮食统销工作的混乱局面。例如太仓县新湖乡，在第一次核定供应计划时，乡工作人员看到哪个叫喊缺粮，就发给哪个供应证，结果全乡有五百多户需要供应。可是，在第一次核定之后，接着两次又有一百一十多户要求供应，最后全乡供应面达百分之九十五以上，供应量达四十三万多斤。盲目扩大供应面不但不能解决问题，反而把事情越弄越坏，许多群众仍经常外出争购熟食；真正缺粮的则表示不满，他们说：政府做事不公平，会讨巧的人占便宜。
    其次是由于农民小生产者的心理习惯同国家的计划经济发生矛盾。不少农民有“堆金不如积谷”的思想，他们对粮食具有一种特殊的感情，因而在统购时，农民总是希望少卖一些多留一些，在统销中他们则希望能多买一些早买一些。因此在统购之后，缺粮的要买粮，不缺粮的也要买粮，该少买的要多买，该迟买的要早买，已经买了的还要再买。例如昆山县周墅乡的农民在统购后说：“卖出了粮食就像嫁出了姑娘，心里总舍不得。”因此有的就想在统销中把卖出的粮食再买回来。吴县桥东乡有些农民说：“老鼠也有过冬粮，我们买点吃点怎么行。”今年三、四月间，这个乡唐庄村有二十八户农民，每天都到苏州排队抢购熟食。经派人调查，这二十八户农民四月份全不缺粮。
    再次是由于地主、富农、反革命分子的造谣破坏。他们抓住我们工作中的某些缺点和农民的紧张心理，散布谣言，煽动挑拨，大量套购抢购。有些反革命分子公开煽动群众说：“哪家生产，哪家有粮。”“哪家烟囱冒烟，大家就到哪家去吃。”这就造成了某些农民的紧张心理。吴县桥东乡五十七户富农，经常外出抢购；蠡国乡富农周荣坤（已依法逮捕）统购尾欠二千多斤粮食，统购后前后共抢购面条、大饼、年糕等一千一百三十多斤。有些地主、富农、反革命分子用极卑鄙的手段拉拢、腐蚀工作人员，个别地方还发现有反革命分子企图煽动群众殴打工作人员。
    为了及时消除粮食统销工作中的混乱现象，各县县委和县人民政府从三月下旬起都把整顿粮食统销工作作为稳定农民生产情绪、保证春耕生产顺利进行的一项重要措施。各县都召开了县、区、乡三级工作人员会议，由党内到党外、由工作人员到群众，深入地进行了有关整顿粮食统销的思想发动工作；对农村粮食供应情况普遍作了分析和调查；在大力宣传粮食“三定”政策的基础上，按乡公布了第二季度的粮食销售指标，经过民主讨论，核定了全乡供应计划，并由上级政府最后加以审查批准。到四月底止，全专区的整顿粮食统销工作已获得了显著成效。
    第一，经过广泛的社会主义思想教育和国家粮食“三定”政策的宣传，提高了干部的政治觉悟，消除了群众的紧张心理。在宣传国家的粮食政策时，各地首先通过算征、购、销的细账，分析农村情况和农民思想特点，用具体的事例说明了粮食统购统销给国家给人民带来的好处；说明了该供应的一定供应、该少供应的就少供应、不该供应的就一定不供应的原则。通过典型乡、村整顿统销工作的成功经验的介绍，消除了基层工作人员对整顿统销工作的抵触情绪。再通过他们向群众广泛宣传粮食政策，群众情绪也迅速稳定。有的农民说：“听到政策，等于混水缸里放了明矾，心里定当了。”“不要去同政府争粮，要同田地争粮。”生产情绪大为高涨。常熟县店岸乡复兴村过去户户都说缺粮，生产消极，经过政策宣传，有的农民说：“这些日子真把社会主义忘了，再闹就对不起国家。”当时就有二十九户农民把隐藏的粮食拿出来曝晒，全村积极投入生产。
    第二，通过宣布四、五、六月份的粮食销售指标，依靠和发动群众核定本乡粮食供应计划，保证了对缺粮户的供应，缩减了可以少供应的部分，削除了不该供应的部分，从而使统销工作达到公平合理。根据全专区一千一百八十三个乡的统计，经过群众讨论核定的第二季度粮食供应计划较原计划下降了百分之十八点五。全专区四月份粮食销售量比三月份下降了百分之五。由于群众消除了顾虑，在第二季度供应计划核定之后，农村经济生活也渐形活跃，粮食市场成交量逐日增加。太仓县新生乡农民王永芳，开始要求六月份供应一百七十斤粮食，宣布了粮食销售指标后，他说：“我原来要不了这许多，就是不懂政策，有个积谷防荒的思想，现在政府规定合理供应，我多买了人家就要少买。”因此自动减少供应一百三十五斤。
    第三，在整顿粮食统销工作中，各地都坚持贯彻了党在农村中的阶级路线，因而提高了贫农的觉悟，团结和教育了中农，制止了破坏活动。各地一般都召开了贫农座谈会，对他们进行粮食统销政策教育，并通过他们排队摸底，掌握了农村的粮食情况；消除了中农对粮食统销的抵触情绪。对富农和其他坏分子的破坏行为，贫农和中农都能及时地坚决地予以公开的揭发和打击。根据荡湖乡群众的检举，吴县人民法院依法处理了两户严重破坏统销政策的富农。有些过去听信富农谣言不积极生产的农民说：“过去只怪自己糊涂，上了富农的当，耽误了生产。”
    各地对一些违法乱纪、徇私舞弊的工作人员，都分别情况作了适当的处理，得到了群众的拥护。
    第四，在整顿农村粮食统销工作的同时，加强了对城镇粮食统销工作的领导，堵塞了漏洞，杜绝了流弊，经过宣传教育，在广大城镇人民中，初步树立了节约粮食的思想，从而使城镇的统销工作也有了改进。据全专区五十三个城镇统计，第二季度供应量原核定为四千三百多万斤，经过整顿后，下降为三千九百多万斤。
