    Guangzhou is actively arranging production for private industrial and individual handicraft households to overcome the off-season. In order to help solve the production difficulties faced by private factories in the ship repair and automobile repair industries during the off-season, the Guangzhou First Bureau of Industry has transferred part of the production tasks to them through state-owned and joint state-private enterprises. The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications' Navigation Engineering General Bureau Ship Machinery Repair Factory and two other units have transferred a total of more than 6,400 workdays of production tasks, amounting to 24,000 yuan in processing fees, which can basically maintain the production of private ship repair factories in the second quarter. The difficulties of insufficient raw materials and tasks in the eighteen sectors of the private textile industry have been addressed and resolved through measures such as increasing tasks, making reasonable adjustments, and saving raw materials, with the cooperation of the Guangzhou Second Bureau of Industry and relevant departments. For example, the China National Goods Company Guangzhou Purchasing and Supply Station has increased the processing task for knitted socks by 10,000 dozens for the knitting industry.
    In order to help individual handicraft households overcome the off-season, the Guangzhou Handicraft Bureau conducted a survey of production, supply, and sales conditions in ninety-eight sectors that were estimated to be facing difficulties in April, and found that the main difficulties in these sectors were insufficient raw materials and problems with sales. Currently, with the cooperation of relevant departments, most of these problems have been basically resolved through arrangements. For example, in the toothbrush industry, according to the survey, a minimum of 100,500 toothbrushes needs to be produced each month to maintain operations, but the original processing and self-produced and self-sold volume was only 55,000 toothbrushes. The China National Goods Company Guangzhou Purchasing and Supply Station and other units have increased processing tasks to make up for the difference, and state-owned animal products companies and other units are assisting in solving the problem of raw materials such as cattle bone and pig bristles.
    The production of other private industrial and individual handicraft households facing difficulties is being actively arranged.

    广州市积极安排私营工业和个体手工业户度过淡季
    广州市积极安排私营工业和个体手工业户生产度过淡季。广州市第一工业局为了协助解决轮船修理和汽车修理工业私营工厂的淡季生产困难，已经通过国营和公私合营企业让出部分生产任务给他们。交通部航务工程总局第一工程局船舶机器修理厂等三个单位，共让出了六千四百多个工作日的生产任务，计加工费二万四千元，这基本上已经可以维持轮船修理业私营工厂第二季度的生产。私营纺织工业的十八个行业的原料和任务不足的困难，在广州市第二工业局和有关部门的配合下，采取增加任务、合理调整和节约原料等办法安排解决。如针织业已经由中国百货公司广州采购供应站增加了一万打袜子的加工任务。
    为了协助个体手工业户度过淡季，广州市手工业局，在四月间对估计有困难的九十八个行业进行了产、供、销情况的调查，发现这些行业的主要困难是原料不足和销路有问题。目前在各有关部门的配合下，经过安排，大部分基本获得解决。如牙刷业，据调查每月最低需要产十万零五千支才能维持，但原来加工的和他们自产自销的只有五万五千支，相差的数目，已经由中国百货公司广州采购供应站等单位给增加加工任务，所需要的牛骨、猪鬃等原料则由国营畜产公司等单位协助解决。
    对其他有困难的私营工业和个体手工业户的生产正在积极安排。
