    The three batches of materials exposing the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique successively published by the "People's Daily", especially the third batch, thoroughly revealed that Hu Feng and many of his key members had long been loyal running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. They had close ties with the imperialist Kuomintang secret service and had long disguised themselves as revolutionaries, hiding within the progressive people and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. They were by no means, as they pretended, a revolutionary literary team with differing literary ideas, or a group among the people who had made ideological errors or simply disagreed on certain issues. Therefore, the struggle to crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is by no means merely a matter for the literary and art circles, but a serious political struggle of the entire people against a counter-revolutionary clique.
    Now the people of the whole country realize that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a thorough and complete counter-revolutionary clique. They express great indignation at their heinous crimes of opposing the Communist Party and the people, and demand further investigation and punishment according to the law. Similarly, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are also extremely angry and enthusiastically demand to participate in this serious political struggle.
    It is undeniable that our army has been extremely lax in its vigilance against the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique for a long time. For example, books and periodicals published by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique were allowed to be stored in large quantities in some of our libraries and read by anyone, and Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members like Lu Ling were allowed to go to the troops, and even to the Volunteer Army, to spread "ideological poison." Even now, there are still a few people in the army who do not deeply understand the extreme harmfulness of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, thinking that "the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is just a cultural special agent, and the struggle to crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is only an internal matter of the cultural circles," thinking that it has little to do with the army, and therefore they are indifferent to this serious political struggle. Some people also think that "they have not seen Hu Feng using assassination, poisoning, explosions, or organizing escapes and disintegrating the troops to sabotage the army, like the Japanese or American-Chiang special agents in the past." Therefore, they underestimate the serious significance of the army's enthusiastic participation in this struggle. All these are very wrong.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army led by the Chinese Communist Party. It is an armed force that implements the Party's line and policies, and it is an armed force that serves the people's struggle and national construction. In this great period of building a socialist society, it shoulders the sacred task of defending the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and safeguarding national security and territorial sovereignty. However, in this stage of socialist revolution, it is a profound, extensive, and extremely complex and acute class struggle. Not only the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members, but also all other kinds of counter-revolutionaries will inevitably carry out various sabotage activities. Because our army shoulders the important task of defending the motherland, the counter-revolutionaries will be even more deliberate in using various vicious means to carry out sabotage. We must quickly correct the past laxity and negligence, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members, along with all other counter-revolutionaries, from the army.
    The struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in the troops must be carried out with emphasis and in a step-by-step manner. First, education must be carried out conscientiously among the cadres. They must read the "People's Daily" editorials, editor's notes, the first, second, and third batches of published materials, and Guo Moruo's "Anti-Socialist Hu Feng Program" and other documents, and hold discussions to criticize complacency and improve vigilance and the initiative to struggle. Second, on the basis of ideological and organizational preparation, we must seize upon organs (such as propaganda and cultural departments), schools (such as schools with concentrated intellectuals), especially units where Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members have been found, and launch the struggle, and call on all Hu Feng clique members and those affected to come forward and thoroughly confess, criticize themselves, expose Hu Feng, and become new people. We must also call on all hidden counter-revolutionaries and reactionaries to make frank confessions in order to further purify the people's army. In order to strengthen leadership, it is necessary to have organization, planning, investigation, and research, and to gradually and thoroughly maintain the normal development of this struggle.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army has the strong leadership of the Party, rich experience in carrying out various struggles against various enemies, and a large number of long-tested cadres. As long as we are immediately mobilized to analyze and criticize Hu Feng's various absurd remarks, thoughts, and insidious two-faced tactics, we will definitely thoroughly clarify the face of this counter-revolutionary gang of Hu Feng, and we will never allow them to continue to play tricks of deception. All hidden counter-revolutionaries will also be exposed, and this struggle will surely achieve a major victory.

    全军警惕起来，彻底肃清胡风反革命集团
    傅锺
    “人民日报”连续公布的三批揭露胡风反革命集团罪行的材料，特别是第三批材料，彻底地揭露了胡风和胡风的许多骨干分子很久以来就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，他们和帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切联系，长期地伪装革命，潜藏在进步人民内部，干着反革命勾当。绝不像他们所伪装的那样，是一个什么革命文艺队伍中文艺思想不同的集团，是什么人民内部犯有思想错误或者只是在某些问题上意见不同的集团。因此，粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争，决不仅仅是文艺界的事情，这是全体人民对反革命集团的严重政治斗争。
    现在全国人民都认识到胡风反革命集团是一个彻头彻尾的反革命的集团了，对他们进行这种反共反人民的滔天罪行表示极大的愤懑，都要求再进一步地对他们追查，然后依法惩办。同样，中国人民解放军全体指战员们也以万分激怒的心情热烈要求参加这一场严重的政治斗争。
    无可讳言，我们军队过去对胡风反革命集团的反革命活动，在长久时期中都是极为麻痹的。例如：曾让胡风反革命集团所出的书刊在我们某些图书馆大量存放，任人阅读，以及让胡风反革命集团分子路翎辈随便到部队，甚至到志愿军中进行“思想放毒”等；直到现在部队中也还有少数人没有深刻认识胡风反革命集团的极端的危害性，以为“胡风反革命集团不过是文化特务，粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争仅仅是文化界内部的问题”，以为同军队关系不大，因而对这一严重政治斗争漠不关心。还有的人以为“没有看见胡风像过去日本或美蒋特务一样，用暗杀、放毒、爆炸以及组织逃亡、瓦解部队来破坏军队。”因此就低估了军队必须热烈参加这一斗争的严重意义。这都是十分错误的。
    中国人民解放军是中国共产党领导的军队，是执行党的路线和政策的武装力量，是服务于人民斗争和国家建设事业的武装力量。在这国家建设社会主义社会的伟大时期中，它担负着保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家安全和领土主权的完整的神圣任务。但在这社会主义革命阶段，是一场深刻广泛而又极其复杂尖锐的阶级斗争，不仅胡风反革命集团分子，其他各种反革命分子也必然会进行各种破坏活动。由于我军担负着保卫祖国的重大任务，反革命分子就更加处心积虑地采用各种毒辣手段来进行破坏。我们必须迅速纠正过去那种麻痹大意，百倍提高警惕，把胡风反革命集团分子，连同其他一切反革命分子坚决彻底地从军队中清除出去。
    在部队反对胡风反革命集团的斗争必须有重点、有步骤地展开。首先，在干部中认真地进行教育，阅读“人民日报”社论、编者按语、第一、二、三次公布的材料和郭沫若的“反社会主义的胡风纲领”等文件，并举行座谈，批判麻痹思想，提高警惕性和斗争的积极性。其次，在思想准备和组织准备的基础上，抓住机关（如宣传、文化部门）、学校（如知识分子集中的学校），特别是发现有胡风反革命集团分子的单位展开斗争，并号召一切胡风集团分子和受影响的分子站出来彻底坦白交代，批判自己，揭露胡风，重新做人。再号召一切暗藏的反革命分子和反动分子进行坦白交代，以进一步纯洁人民军队。为了加强领导，必须有组织、有计划、有调查、有研究，一步一步深入透彻地使这一斗争保持正常的发展。
    中国人民解放军有着党的坚强领导，有和各种敌人进行各种斗争的丰富经验，有大量久经考验的干部，只要立即动员起来对胡风反革命集团各种荒谬言论、思想和阴险的两面手段，加以分析批判，一定会彻底弄清胡风这一批反革命黑帮的面目，决不容许他们继续玩弄欺骗手段，一切暗藏的反革命分子也一定会揭露出来的，这个斗争一定能够取得重大的胜利。
