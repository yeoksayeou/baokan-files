After Prime Minister Nehru disembarked from the plane, he gave a brief speech to the welcomers. Amidst applause, he said cordially: I have long wanted to come to Uzbekistan to meet you. We are neighbors, and neighbors should usually understand each other fully. Our mutual relations have a long history. I have heard many things about the rapid progress of your republic. I hope this progress will continue. You have said that world peace must be maintained. We know very well that without peace, neither your country nor our country can progress. Therefore, we need peace, and we must all work for peace. Mr. Nehru's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause. People cheered, "Long live the friendship between India and the Soviet Union!"

　　The welcoming crowd stretched all the way from the airport to the residence arranged for Nehru, and they warmly saluted the guests. In the evening, Nehru and others went to the theater to watch Uzbek, Russian, and Indian song and dance performances.

    新华社十六日讯　据塔斯社消息：印度共和国总理尼赫鲁和随员一行连日在第比利斯、塔什干等地继续进行参观访问活动。现正访苏的印度记者也随同参观。
    尼赫鲁等十三日到第比利斯后，在第比利斯附近参观了十年前才从草原上建筑起来的年青城市鲁斯塔威。当他们游览市容时，受到聚集在街道两旁的数千鲁斯塔威居民的热烈欢迎。尼赫鲁在这里参观了斯大林钢铁工厂和吉戈姆斯基葡萄种植国营农场。他和他的女儿英迪拉·甘地夫人对于种植葡萄的方法、收获量以及防风带的建造很感兴趣。
    十四日，尼赫鲁一行从第比利斯飞往塔什干。途中，访问了土库曼共和国首都阿什哈巴德。当来宾们的飞机降落时，机场上有数千人热烈欢迎。阿什哈巴德人民并以土库曼长袍和毛皮帽赠给尼赫鲁。
    同日中午，尼赫鲁一行抵塔什干。乌兹别克共和国部长会议主席穆希金诺夫等人在机场上欢迎。尼赫鲁总理下机后向欢迎者发表了简短的谈话。他在鼓掌声中亲切地说：我早就想来乌兹别克，来同你们见面。我们是邻居，邻居通常是应该彼此充分了解的。我们的相互关系是由来已久的。我曾听到许多关于你们的共和国飞跃前进的话。我希望这种前进将继续下去。你们说过必须维持世界和平。我们知道得很清楚，如果没有和平，你们的国家，我们的国家都不可能进步。因此，我们需要和平，我们大家必须为和平而努力。尼赫鲁先生的讲话一再被掌声所打断。人们欢呼：“印度和苏联之间的友谊万岁！”
    欢迎的人群一直从机场排到为尼赫鲁安排的住所，他们热烈地向来宾们致敬。晚上，尼赫鲁等到剧院观看了乌兹别克、俄罗斯和印度的歌舞。
