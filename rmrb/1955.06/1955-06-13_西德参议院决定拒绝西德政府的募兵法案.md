Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th. According to reports in West Berlin newspapers citing TASS: The West German Senate unanimously passed a resolution on the 10th rejecting the West German government's proposed law on recruiting "volunteer soldiers." The Senate rejected the bill on the grounds that "the legal basis of this bill is insufficient."

    The West German government submitted the bill to the Senate for discussion at the end of May, so that the Senate could pass the bill before the summer recess on June 15. The purpose of this bill is to guarantee the establishment of the first batch of troops in accordance with the Paris Agreement.

    An Associated Press dispatch pointed out: The West German Senate's resolution dealt a blow to the West German government's plan to rapidly recruit troops.

    West Germany's "Spandauer Volksblatt" wrote in an editorial: "It is quite clear that this is a warning from the opposition to the Federal Government's excessive haste."

    It is well known that the Social Democratic leader had condemned the conscription bill proposed by the government, believing it to be another obstacle to resolving the German question in the context of the upcoming Four-Power Conference.

    It should be pointed out that West German politicians did not doubt until the last moment that the Senate would not accept the conscription bill.

    西德参议院决定拒绝西德政府的募兵法案
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社引西柏林报纸报道：西德参议院十日一致通过决议，拒绝西德政府所提出的关于招募“志愿兵”的法案。参议院拒绝的理由是“这个法案的法律根据不充足”。
    西德政府是在五月底把这个法案提交参议院讨论的，以便参议院在六月十五日休会以前通过这个法案。这个法案的目的是保证根据巴黎协定建立第一批部队。
    美联社的消息指出：西德参议院的决议使西德政府迅速招募军队的计划受到了打击。
    西德的“斯班都人民报”在社论中写道：“十分明显，这是反对派对联邦政府过分匆忙的一个警告。”
    大家知道，社会民主党领袖曾经谴责政府所提出的这个募兵法案，在四国会谈将要举行的情况下，认为它是解决德国问题的又一个障碍。
    应当指出，西德政界人士直到最后一刻都没有怀疑参议院会不接受这个募兵法案。
