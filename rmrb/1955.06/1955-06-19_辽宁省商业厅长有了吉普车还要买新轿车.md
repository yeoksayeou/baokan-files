To the Editor:

    Not long after Liaoning Province was merged, the Department of Commerce spent more than 32,000 yuan to buy two new Warsaw 20 sedans.
    During the merger, the Preparatory Committee of the former Liaoning Province allocated two Jeeps for the Department of Commerce to use. At the time, Tong Yun, the director of the Department of Commerce, felt that these Jeeps were "too broken" and "too old" and very unsightly. Later, the Provincial Office prepared to allocate two sedans to him, but he didn't want them because they weren't new. According to the Preparatory Committee's regulations, the Department of Commerce already had five directors and deputy directors, and two Jeeps were enough. However, Tong Yun used the excuse that Shenyang was a large city, the companies were scattered, and the managers requested to buy cars, etc., and spent 32,454 yuan through the Liaoning Transportation and Electrical Appliance Company to buy two new Polish sedans.
    The new sedans were bought, but the funds could not be resolved, because there was no such budget item in the 1954 basic construction indicators. Later, after joint research by the directors and deputy directors, it was decided to temporarily advance the money from employee welfare funds, the finance section's temporary deposits, and administrative expenses.
    Although the Department of Commerce has specifically formulated a "Provisional Management System for Cars" for these two new sedans, stipulating that the Department of Commerce should "centrally and uniformly manage them for the use of responsible comrades of directly affiliated units of the Department of Commerce" (including the director, company managers, and section chiefs), in reality, one of the new sedans has become Director Tong's personal car. As for the original two Jeeps, only one is occasionally used by company managers and section chiefs, while the other is parked in the garage for a long time.
    Our country is vigorously practicing thrift and needs to accumulate a large amount of funds to invest in the great socialist construction, but Tong Yun, the director of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Commerce, tries every means to create excuses, waste funds, and achieve his personal goal of flaunting wealth, which is extremely wrong. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant departments in Liaoning Province seriously investigate this matter.

### 辽宁省商业厅长有了吉普车还要买新轿车

    辽宁省商业厅长有了吉普车还要买新轿车编辑同志：
    辽宁省刚并省不久，商业厅就花了三万二千多元买了两辆华沙二十号新轿车。
    在并省的时候，前辽宁省筹备委员会曾经调配了两辆吉普车给商业厅使用。当时，商业厅长佟云认为这种吉普“太破”、“太旧”，很不雅观；后来，省办公厅准备调两辆轿车给他，他看看不是新的，还是不愿意要。按照筹备委员会的规定，商业厅现有正、副厅长五人，两台小吉普车已经够用了；但佟云借口沈阳城市大，公司分散，经理们要求买汽车等等理由，通过辽宁交通电器公司花费三万二千四百五十四元，又买进了两辆波兰新轿车。
    新轿车买来了，车款却无法解决，因为一九五四年的基本建设指标中，并没有这项预算。后来，经过正副厅长共同研究，决定从职工福利费、财务科暂存款和行政经费中暂时垫付。
    虽然商业厅为这两辆新轿车专门制定了一个“小汽车暂行管理制度”，规定由商业厅“集中统一管理，供商业厅直属各单位负责同志乘用”（包括厅长、公司经理和处长），实际上有一辆新轿车已经成了佟厅长的专车。至于原有的两辆吉普车，只有一辆偶然为各公司经理和处长跑一跑，另一辆则长期停放在车库里。
    我们的国家正在厉行节约，要积累大量的资金，投入伟大的社会主义建设中去，而辽宁省商业厅长佟云，却想尽办法，制造借口，浪费资金，达到个人摆阔绰的目的，这是极端错误的。因此，我建议辽宁省的有关部门认真检查这件事。
