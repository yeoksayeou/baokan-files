Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 3rd. The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and the Institute of Applied Chemistry have rewarded a group of scientific research workers with outstanding achievements. A total of nineteen research groups from the two institutes received collective awards; twenty-three scientific workers and assistant staff received individual awards.

　　The collectives awarded this time all achieved good research results in 1954. The Institute of Applied Chemistry rewarded a group of scientific researchers who repeatedly carried out ore analysis in coordination with key projects. They not only provided the design data required according to the plan but also did a lot of work in improving the analysis methods. The scientific workers of this institute also successfully trial-produced pressboard for the first time in China; successfully researched the use of waste pulp liquor to tan leather; and successfully trial-produced "phosphating salt" to prevent steel corrosion using ferromanganese instead of manganese ore, which reduced the cost of the product and increased the output. This time they were also rewarded. The spectroscopy group of the Institute of Applied Chemistry's Physical Chemistry Research Office, which received the award, held spectroscopy analysis training courses for relevant industrial departments, universities, and scientific research institutions across the country, enabling more than sixty students to master the basic theories and experimental techniques of spectroscopy analysis. The scientific workers of various research offices of the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering successfully manufactured tools by casting for the first time in China; helped automobile factories establish die-casting technology and completed the design method for the latest voltage regulators; applied long-distance measurement devices and series capacitor transmission methods in China's power system; and successfully trial-produced photoelectric tubes for the first time. These achievements have earned them rewards. The tutoring group that greatly helped the researchers of the two institutes to learn Russian also received a collective award. The more than twenty researchers, trainees, and technicians who won individual awards not only generally achieved significant results in their work but also had many advantages in combining their work with learning.

    中国科学院机械电机研究所和应用化学研究所
    奖励一批有突出成绩的科学研究工作者
    新华社长春三日电　中国科学院机械电机研究所和应用化学研究所奖励了一批有突出成绩的科学研究工作者。两个研究所共有十九个研究组获得集体奖；有二十三个科学工作者和助理业务人员获得个人奖。
    这次受奖的集体在一九五四年都曾得到较好的研究结果。应用化学研究所奖励了多次为配合重点工程进行矿石分析的一批科学研究工作者，他们不但按计划提供了设计所需的资料，并在改进分析方法上也做了许多工作。这个研究所的科学工作者还在我国第一次试制成功钢纸；研究成功利用纸浆废液鞣制皮革；利用锰铁代替锰矿试制成功防止钢铁腐蚀的“磷化用盐”，减低了产品的成本，提高了产量。这次他们也受到奖励。受奖的应用化学研究所物理化学研究室的光谱组，为全国各有关产业部门、高等学校和科学研究机关举办了光谱分析学习会，使六十多名学员掌握了光谱分析的基本理论和实验技术。机械电机研究所各个研究室的科学工作者在我国首次利用铸造方法制造刀具；帮助汽车厂建立压铸技术，完成最新式的电压调整器的设计方法；在我国电力系统中应用远距离测量的装置和串联电容器的输电方式；以及首次试制光电管成功。以上这些成就使他们得到了奖励。帮助两个研究所的研究人员学习俄文有很大成绩的辅导小组，也获得了集体奖。获得个人奖的二十多名研究人员、练习生和技术工人等，除一般都在工作上有显著成绩外，并在结合业务进行学习等方面也有很多优点。
