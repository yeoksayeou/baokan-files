    Completion of the Yushan Dam Heightening and Thickening Project
    The Yushan Dam heightening and thickening project, a well-known dangerous section of the Huai River's north bank main levee, has been successfully completed. The completion of this project provides a reliable barrier for the Fei River embankment, and will better protect more than three million mu of farmland along the Fei River, as well as the Huai River, Ying River, and Wo River areas.
    The Yushan Dam faces the Huai River, backs onto the Fei River, and spans between Dongfeng Lake and Maojia Lake, stretching for seven *li*. It has historically been a dangerous section in northern Anhui prone to breaches and disasters. This heightening and thickening project was carried out based on the 1954 flood control experience. The base of the new dam has been widened to more than 70 meters, with a height of 9 meters, exceeding the 1954 record flood level by 8 *cun*.

    禹山坝加高培厚工程完工
    淮河北岸干堤著名的险段禹山坝加高培厚工程已经胜利完工。这项工程完成后，使淝河圈堤有了可靠的屏障，将更好地保护着淝河两岸及淮河、颍河、涡河一带的三百多万亩农田。
    禹山坝面临淮河背枕淝河、横跨董峰湖与毛家湖之间，长达七华里，是淮北历年溃决成灾的险段。这次加高培厚工程是根据一九五四年防汛经验进行的，新坝坝底加宽到七十多公尺，高有九公尺，比一九五四年特大洪水位高出八公寸。
