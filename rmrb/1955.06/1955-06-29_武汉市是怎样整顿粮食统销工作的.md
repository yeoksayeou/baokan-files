How Wuhan Municipality Rectified the Grain Unified Purchase and Supply Work
Liu Wen

    Increasing Grain Sales Volume

    Since October 1954, the grain sales situation in Wuhan Municipality has been very abnormal, with sales rising in a straight line, exceeding the plan month after month. If we take the average monthly sales of rice and flour in the city from January to September 1954 as 100, then October was 120.01, November was 130.06, December was 139.19, and March of this year rose to 142.33, and April reached 148.15. This rate of increase far exceeded the rate of population growth. Taking the population and grain sales volume in January of this year as the base, the population increased by 2.1 percent in March, while the grain sales volume increased by 12.87 percent. The reasons for this situation were mainly the large outflow of grain and serious waste. In 1954, the areas near Wuhan Municipality suffered severe flooding, and grain supply control was tighter in rural areas, while grain supply management in the city was very loose. Therefore, large amounts of grain flowed back to the countryside from the city. According to the results of a key inspection in the latter half of March this year, more than 1,200 cases of grain outflow were discovered on only a few major transportation routes, totaling more than 15,000 jin of grain, as well as many grain-made products. Waste was widespread. Especially in collective mess halls, the waste was even more serious. For example, Huazhong Institute of Technology wasted 90 jin of rice per meal. If this situation is not resolutely stopped, it will not only seriously affect the implementation of the state's grain policy and the rational supply of grain, but also seriously affect the country's socialist construction and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. In order to eliminate these abnormal phenomena, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee launched a publicity and education campaign in late March to save grain, oppose waste, and prohibit outflow, conducted inspections of grain waste in government agencies and residents, and took some corresponding measures. After the mass publicity and education on saving grain, the masses had a preliminary understanding of the great significance of saving grain. Many government agencies and organizations have made some improvements in food management and cooking methods, and the phenomenon of grain waste has been greatly reduced. However, on the other hand, some people also had some illusions, such as "being afraid of eating coarse grains, being afraid of rationing, and being afraid of not having enough to eat." At the same time, there was a lack of firm and effective measures and practical methods. Therefore, many people purchased and hoarded grain, and government agencies generally had the phenomenon of inflating the population and expanding the budget. Therefore, the grain sales volume in March and April did not decrease, but rebounded.

    Implementing Planned Supply Based on Household Verification

    In order to completely block the loopholes in the planned grain supply, effectively curb the outflow and waste of grain, and truly achieve rational supply, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee decided to implement different supply methods for different objects throughout the city from May, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on stepping up the rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work.

    Planned supply based on household verification was implemented from May for residents (including residents with fixed household registration in the urban area, private industrial and commercial households with less than 50 people starting meals together, boat dwellers, and non-agricultural population in suburban areas). The method of supply is to verify the grain purchase plan household by household, and purchase grain from designated grain stores on a monthly basis within the plan with the certificate. When determining the plan, the actual consumption level of each household from April to September 1954 shall prevail (because the sales situation was relatively normal during this period), and the part of grain wasted in the past shall be appropriately deducted; for those whose records are incomplete or have special reasons, the consumption level of families with the same occupation and equal population can be used for reference.

    Before the start of implementation, 500 typical households were first sampled in various districts of the city. The survey materials show that the grain purchase certificate records of residents from April to September 1954 were generally complete, the consumption level was relatively normal and reasonable, and the comprehensive average consumption of various occupations per capita was 20.58 jin per month, which was roughly in line with the total sales volume of the city. Immediately, a large number of personnel were transferred to establish grain planned supply offices in the city and various districts, core groups were established in each street, and working groups were established in each residents' committee. The work officially started on May 4th. First, new certificates were issued to register the population; then, publicity and education were carried out to verify the number of people starting meals together and to determine the grain purchase plan, and met with the masses.

    The work of registering the population and issuing new certificates was completed in three days. At this time, the masses had some suspicions and did not know why the certificates were being replaced. After the certificate replacement, the publicity work was immediately launched. At the same time, according to the old certificates recovered, the average consumption level was calculated, the number of people starting meals together was verified, the plan was determined, and reported level by level for comprehensive reporting. After being approved by the Municipal Grain Planned Supply Office, it met with the masses. The ways to meet were: (1) Convening meetings of backbones (residents' committee members, residents' group leaders, activists) by residents' group, focusing on clarifying the policy and explaining the basis of the calculation; then, the plans determined on a household-by-household basis were announced and opinions were solicited. (2) Convening residents' meetings by residents' group, repeatedly publicizing the policy, and educating the masses to adopt a correct attitude towards the planned grain supply. (3) The issued new certificates were taken back, filled in household by household according to the determined plan, and distributed to each household by the residents' group leader. At the same time as determining the plan, the Municipal Grain Bureau established a grain purchase household registration card in each grain store (including cooperatives, railway supply section agency stores, and private consignment stores).

    As a result of the complete household-by-household plan verification, a total of more than 1.07 million people starting meals together were verified, and the monthly supply plan volume was more than 21.98 million jin, with an average level of 20.4103 jin per person per month, a decrease of 1.0677 jin compared with the average sales volume from April to September 1954 (21.478 jin).

    After the figures were announced, the majority of citizens supported and expressed satisfaction. For example, Liu Jianhua, a resident of Tongyi Street in Jianghan District, said when he received the grain purchase certificate after the plan was determined: "I wasted a lot in the past, and I will pay attention to cherishing food in the future, which is good for the country and for individuals." Some residents, after carefully calculating their accounts, voluntarily requested to reduce the plan. For example, Xia Lianrong, a resident of Changnianli in Jiangan District, has six people in his family and was approved for 114 jin. He requested to reduce it by 14 jin. He said: "If I have more than ten jin per month, I will have more than one hundred jin per year; if I don't reduce the plan, it will not be good for the country or myself." Another example is Wang Jizong's family in Nanhu District, which has five people. After the plan was determined, they voluntarily reported a reduction of two liang per person per month. He said: "In 1948, the countryside was flooded, and the reactionary government closed the sluice gate. There was nothing to eat at home. How difficult that was! Now life is much better. Doing this is for all of us to have enough to eat." Zhang Jinxiu, a 70-year-old woman, recalled the great flood in 1931 and said: "At that time, you couldn't even buy bran with money. Now it's good, with a fixed plan, we are guaranteed to have enough to eat." There are many such examples.

    However, many people's hearts are filled with contradictions. From the perspective of the interests of socialist construction, they support the planned supply; however, they still lack the habit of living a planned life. Some people have no idea how much they actually eat and say, "Let's try accepting the plan and eating for a month." Some of the masses also have insufficient understanding of the planned supply based on household verification and have the idea of "being generous for preparation" and blindly shouting "not enough." For example, Bian Changhou in Changnianli has four people in his family (two adults and two children) and was approved for 88 jin. He said it was not enough and said "half short." After carefully calculating, it turned out that there were eight jin more. Zhang Yatou, a resident of Jiefang Avenue, took the grain purchase certificate without looking at it and said "not enough." At the same time, some bad elements also took the opportunity to sabotage. In fact, many residents' homes still had a lot of grain in storage. For example, Tu Xiuqing in Zizhi Street, Jianghan District, shouted "not enough." It was later discovered that he had stored more than 370 jin of grain in his home, with rice numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 all complete. Another example is the Baoshan Street Residents' Committee, under the jurisdiction of the Liujiaoting Street Office in Qiaokou District, which has nine residents' groups and a total of 610 households. 76 households (accounting for 12.46 percent of the total number of households) still had more than 3,000 jin of grain left over from this month as of the 30th, with an average of 40 jin per household. Most of the remaining households still have enough grain in storage to last until the end of the month.

    In order to break the masses' concerns and expose the rumors of bad elements, repeated and in-depth publicity and education work was carried out. At the same time, individual cases of excessive or insufficient deviations in the planned supply work verified on a household-by-household basis were reviewed and individually adjusted. For households with excessive deviations, they were persuaded to reduce them appropriately; for those with truly special circumstances where there was not enough after the verification was reduced, they were appropriately increased in a realistic manner. According to the control indicators and the reports from various districts after the review, the average consumption level per capita per month for residents is about 21 jin, which is still about half a jin lower than the average consumption level from April to September 1954, and the average sales volume per capita is reduced by 9.0683 jin compared with the sales volume in April of this year, with a total reduction in sales of more than 8 million jin.

    The method of planned supply based on household verification is also adopted for grain-deficient households in rural suburbs. However, the method is based on the spirit of "three fixings," and the municipal grain department uniformly allocates sales indicators to districts, and the districts allocate them to townships, and then conduct evaluations on a household-by-household basis to distinguish between surplus, sufficient, and deficient households, determine the time of grain deficiency and the amount of grain deficiency, and issue grain purchase certificates to purchase from designated grain stores. This work in the suburbs is still in progress and has not been fully completed. From the current situation, the prescribed indicators can generally be implemented, and unreasonable grain supply can be reduced.

    The supply to the floating population is based on the method of registering upon arrival, canceling upon departure, and supplying with certain documents (such as the original grain transfer certificate, floating grain coupons, etc.).

    Categorized Quantitative Supply to Collective Mess Halls

    The grain supply to public collective mess halls such as government agencies and organizations (including private industrial and commercial households with more than 50 people starting meals together) has been implementing the grain pre-budget and final accounts system since April of this year. Since the implementation for two months, the effect has been very small due to the lack of specific standards, and collective mess halls generally inflated the population and expanded the budget. In order to further block loopholes in the waste of grain, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to implement the "Trial Measures for Categorized Quantitative Planned Grain Supply to Government Agencies, Organizations, Schools, Enterprises, and Collective Mess Halls" from June, that is, the "four fixings" supply method of "fixing people, fixing quantity, fixing time, and fixing location": eight supply standards that must not be exceeded are stipulated for different types of the population; each unit shall prepare a grain purchase application form according to the actual number of people starting meals together and consumption status each month within the prescribed standards, and the district people's committee shall review and determine the quantitative amount, and purchase grain at the designated location in batches each month with the grain purchase application form. In order to solve the problem of temporary mobile meals for inter-agency and employee holidays, the Municipal Grain Bureau printed a number of grain coupons, and each unit can exchange a portion of grain coupons for use within the fixed quantity according to actual needs. Certain procedures are also stipulated for calculating the population, temporary and special grain use, etc. The leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee personally deployed the implementation of this method, so the leading comrades of general units attach great importance to it. It is expected that the implementation of this method will achieve good results.

    Since the implementation of the unified purchase and sales of grain in 1953, the grain supply to grain-using industries has been implementing the method of direct quantitative supply; however, due to the long time, the business nature and operating conditions have changed, and there have been smuggling phenomena in the grain-using industries in the past, so it was decided to conduct a comprehensive adjustment based on the actual grain consumption in March of this year. According to the initial adjustment verification results, the city's grain-using industries can reduce the fixed quantity by more than 1 million jin per month.

    The Effect of Implementing New Measures

    Wuhan Municipality has taken the above measures to implement the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on rectifying the grain unified purchase and sales work, and has made great achievements in strengthening the planned grain supply:

    First of all, it has blocked the loopholes in the grain supply, cracked down on the speculative activities of profiteers, and more effectively brought the grain sales work into the track of the national plan, so that it can resolutely not supply what should not be supplied, make the grain supply reasonable, and reduce the sales volume of grain. It is estimated that the city can reduce sales by about 10 million jin per month from all aspects. Under the principle of ensuring a reasonable supply, more than 100 million jin of grain can be sold less in a year.

    Secondly, the great significance of saving grain has been further deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The vast number of citizens have realized that saving grain has an extremely important role in the country's socialist construction and in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. They have initially developed the habit of cherishing grain and have expressed that they will pay attention to saving in the future.

    Thirdly, the grain department has a more accurate grasp of the consumption needs of citizens, and has a clear understanding of the situation, providing a reliable basis for preparing plans and doing a good job in allocation, processing, and storage. At the same time, various management systems have been established, laying a good foundation for the city's grain supply work to gradually move towards institutionalization.

    There are still shortcomings in the planned supply to residents based on household verification. The main disadvantage is that after the household is verified, changes in population, changes in occupation, changes in the nature of labor, and the growth of children's ages require frequent verification increases and decreases, which is inconvenient for both the grain work department and the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to improve it further in the future in order to gradually form a fixed system.

    武汉市是怎样整顿粮食统销工作的
    刘文
    粮食销售量不断增加
    武汉市的粮食销售情况，从一九五四年十月份起就很不正常，销量直线上升，月月超过计划。若以一九五四年一月份至九月份全市米、面平均月销量为一○○，十月份为一二○·○一，十一月份为一三○·○六，十二月份为一三九·一九，今年三月份上升为一四二·三三，四月份达到一四八·一五。这种上升速度，远远超过了人口增加的速度。以今年一月份人口及粮食销售量为基数，三月份人口增加了百分之二·一，而粮食销售量却增加了百分之一二·八七。发生这种情况的原因，主要是粮食大量外流和严重浪费。一九五四年武汉市附近地区遭受严重水灾，粮食供应控制较紧，而市内粮食供应管理很松。因此，市内粮食大量倒流农村。据今年三月下半月重点检查的结果，仅在一部分交通要道就发现粮食外流的事情一千二百多起，共计粮食一万五千多斤，还有粮食制成品很多。浪费现象普遍存在。特别是集体伙食单位，浪费更为严重。如华中工学院一餐就浪费九十斤饭。这种情况，如不坚决制止，不仅严重影响国家粮食政策的贯彻和粮食的合理供应，也严重影响国家社会主义建设和工农联盟的巩固。中共武汉市委和市人民委员会为了消除这些不正常的现象，在三月下旬开展了节约粮食、反对浪费、禁止外流的宣传教育工作，在机关团体和居民中进行了浪费粮食的检查，并相应地采取了一些措施。经过群众性的节约粮食宣传教育以后，群众对节约粮食的重大意义有了初步认识，很多机关团体在伙食管理及炊事方法上都作了若干改进，粮食浪费现象大大减少。但是，另一方面，一部分人也产生了一些错觉，有“怕吃杂粮，怕定量，怕不够吃”等思想顾虑。同时，也缺乏坚决有效的措施和切实可行的办法。因此，很多人购粮囤积，机关团体也普遍有浮报人口、扩大预算的现象。因此，三、四月份粮食销售量未能下降，反有回升的趋势。
  实行按户核实计划供应
    中共武汉市委和市人民委员会为了彻底堵塞粮食计划供应中的漏洞，有效地制止外流和浪费现象，切实做到合理供应，根据国务院和中共中央关于加紧整顿粮食统销工作的指示，决定自五月份起，在全市范围内，按不同的对象实行了不同的供应办法。
    对居民（包括市区有固定户口的居民，起伙人数在五十人以下的私营工商业户，水上船民，郊区非农业人口等），按户核实计划供应，从五月份开始实行。供应的办法是逐户核实购粮计划，凭证在计划内向指定粮店按月购粮。核定计划时，以各户一九五四年四月份至九月份实际消费水平为准（因为这个时期销售情况比较正常），适当扣除过去浪费粮食部分；对于记录不全或有特殊原因者，可比照职业相同、人口相等的家庭消费水平核定。
    开始实行以前，首先在全市各城区抽查了五百个典型户。调查材料说明，一九五四年四月份至九月份居民购粮证记录一般齐全，消费水平比较正常合理，各种不同职业人口综合每人每月平均消费量为二○·五八斤，同全市总销量大体吻合。随即抽调了大批人员，在全市和各区成立了粮食计划供应办公室，各街道设立核心小组，各居民委员会成立工作组，自五月四日起，正式开始工作。首先换发新证，登记人口；然后进行宣传教育，核实起伙人数，核定购粮计划，同群众见面。
    登记人口、换发新证的工作三天便完成了。这时，群众有些猜疑，不知道换证究竟是为什么。换证以后，紧接着就展开宣传工作。同时，根据收回的旧证，核算平均消费水平，核实起伙人数，确定计划，逐级综合上报，经市粮食计划供应办公室批准后，就同群众见面。见面的方式是：（一）以居民小组为单位，召集骨干（居民委员、居民小组长、积极分子）开会，着重讲清政策，说明核算的依据；然后，把按户核定的计划公布，征求意见。（二）以居民小组为单位，召开居民会议，反复宣传政策，教育群众采取正确态度对待粮食计划供应。（三）把发出的新证收回，按核定的计划逐户填妥，由居民小组长分发各户。在核定计划的同时，市粮食局在各粮店（包括合作社、铁路供应段代理店及私营代销店）建立了购粮分户登记卡片。
    全部按户核实计划的结果，共核实起伙人数一百零七万多人，核定逐月供应计划量二千一百九十八万多斤，每人每月平均水平为二○·四一○三斤，较一九五四年四月至九月平均销售数（二一·四七八斤）减少一·○六七七斤。
    数字公布以后，大多数市民是拥护的，表示满意。例如江汉区统一街居民刘剑华拿到核定计划后的购粮证时说：“我过去浪费多，以后要注意爱惜粮食，这样对国家对个人都有好处。”有些居民经过自己认真算细账后，自动要求核减计划。例如江岸区昌年里居民夏莲荣，家中六口人，核定计划一百一十四斤，要求减少十四斤。他说：“我每月多十几斤，一年就多一百多斤；如果不减计划，对国家对自己都不好。”又如南湖区王吉宗家有五口人，在核定计划后自报每人每月减少二两。他说：“一九四八年乡里渍水，反动政府把水闸关了，家里没有吃的，那日子有多难过！现在日子好多了，这样搞，都是为了咱们大家吃得饱。”七十岁的老太婆张金秀回忆一九三一年大水时说：“那时拿钱连糠也买不到。现在可好了，定了计划，保证吃得饱。”像这样的事例是很多的。
    但是，许多人的内心是充满着矛盾的。从社会主义建设的利益着想，他们对计划供应是拥护的；可是，他们还缺乏有计划地过生活的习惯。有些人对自己究竟吃多少，心中没底，表示“接受计划吃一个月试试看”。也有部分群众，对按户核实计划供应认识不足，有“宽打备用”的思想，盲目地喊“不够”。例如昌年里卞昌侯，家中四口（二大二小），核为八十八斤。他说不够吃，说“差一半”。经过算细账，反而多出八斤。解放大道居民张丫头，拿了购粮证看也没看，就说“不够吃”。同时，有些坏分子也乘机从中破坏。其实，很多居民家中还积存了不少粮食。如江汉区自治街涂秀清吵“不够吃”，后来发现他家中存粮竟达三百七十多斤，并且一、二、三、四号米俱全。又如礄口区六角亭街办事处所辖宝善街居民委员会九个居民小组，共六百一十户，就有七十六户（占总户数的百分之一二·四六），截至三十日止还有在本月份内吃不完的粮食三千多斤，平均每户达四十斤。其余各户大都还有存粮够吃到月底。
    为了打破群众顾虑和揭穿坏分子的谣言，反复深入地做了宣传教育工作。同时，把按户核实计划供应工作中的个别偏高偏低现象，进行了复查和个别调整。对于偏高户，通过说服，适当地减下来；对确实有特殊情况、核少了不够吃的，实事求是地适当增加。根据控制指标和各区汇报情况复查后，居民每人每月平均消费水平约为二十一斤左右，仍较一九五四年四月至九月平均消费水平降低约半斤，比今年四月份销售数每人平均减少九·○六八三斤，共减少销量八百多万斤。
    对郊区农村缺粮户，也采取按户计划供应的办法。不过作法是根据“三定”的精神，由市粮食部门统一分配销售指标下达到区，各区下达到乡，再按户进行评议，分清余、够、缺户，确定缺粮时间和缺粮数量，发给购粮证到指定粮店购买。郊区的这项工作尚在进行，没有全面结束。从目前进行情况来看，规定的指标一般能够贯彻下去，不合理的粮食供应可以缩减下来。
    对流动人口的供应是采取来时登记、去时注销、凭一定证件（如原籍转移粮食证、流动粮票等）供应的办法。
  对集体伙食单位分类定量供应
    对机关团体等公共集体伙食单位（包括起伙人数在五十人以上的私营工商业户）的粮食供应，从今年四月份起就执行了用粮预决算制度。执行两个月以来，由于缺乏具体标准的规定，各集体伙食单位一般的都浮报人口、扩大预算，因而效果很小。为了进一步堵塞浪费粮食的漏洞，中共武汉市委决定自六月份起开始执行“机关、团体、学校、企业、集体伙食单位粮食计划供应分类按单位定量的试行办法”，即“定人、定量、定时、定点”的四定供应办法：按不同类型的人口分别规定不得超过的八种供应标准；各单位逐月按照实际起伙人数及消费情况，在不超过规定标准以内编报购粮申请表，由各区人民委员会审核确定定量，按月分次凭购粮申请表到指定点购粮。并为了解决机关间和职工假日临时流动的吃饭问题，由市粮食局印制了一部分粮票，各单位可根据实际需要，在定量以内换取部分粮票使用。对于计算人口、临时和特殊用粮等也规定了一定的手续。在实行这个办法时，市委领导同志亲自布置，因此一般单位的领导同志都很重视。预期实行这办法将会收到良好效果。
    对用粮行业的粮食供应，自一九五三年实行粮食统购统销时起，便已实行直接定量供应的办法；但由于时间较久，营业性质和经营情况都有所变更，而且用粮行业过去有走私现象，因此决定以今年三月份实际用粮数为准，进行一次全面的调整。经初步调整核定结果，全市用粮行业每月共可缩减定量一百多万斤。
  实行新办法的效果
    武汉市采取了以上这些措施，贯彻了国务院和中共中央关于整顿粮食统销工作的指示，在加强粮食计划供应方面做出了很大成绩：
    首先，堵塞了粮食供应上的漏洞，打击了奸商的投机活动，把粮食销售工作更有效地纳入国家计划的轨道，作到了不该供应的坚决不供应，使粮食供应合理，减少了粮食的销售量。估计全市从各方面减少的销量每月约在一千万斤左右。在保证合理供应的原则下，一年可少销一亿多斤粮食。
    其次，节约粮食的重大意义进一步深入人心，广大市民认识到了节约粮食对国家社会主义建设、对巩固工农联盟都有极其重要的作用，初步养成爱惜粮食的习惯，纷纷表示今后要注意节约。
    第三，粮食部门比较确切地掌握了市民消费的需求情况，做到了心中有数，为编好计划，做好调拨、加工、保管等工作，提供了可靠的依据。同时，建立了各种管理制度，为城市粮食供应工作逐步走向制度化打下了良好的基础。
    对居民按户核实计划供应，还是有缺点的。主要的缺点是按户核定以后，人口发生变动、职业发生变化、劳动性质变更、小孩年岁增长，还要时常核增核减，对粮食工作部门和群众都不方便。因此，今后还须再加改进，以求逐步形成固定的制度。
