    World Peace Congress
    Jean Laffitte, Secretary-General of the World Peace Council
    The World Peace Congress will open in Helsinki in a few days. The Stockholm meeting of the World Peace Council issued a call six months ago for the convening of this congress. The World Peace Council's call has received a very wide response among the people of various countries and has been supported by men and women. These men and women are the men and women of various countries participating in the current movement against the preparation for atomic warfare, the more than four hundred million men and women of the People's Republic of China who signed the demand for the prohibition of nuclear weapons.
    The call for the World Peace Congress has also received a great response among all other peace forces in the world, and has been heartily supported by many ordinary people, and has received the participation of famous people representing countless groups, organizations, and political factions of different natures who are now acting for peace.
    Now, the first delegations are on their way to Helsinki. The representatives of these delegations are elected by the people, and they include members of parliament and politicians from Western countries willing to meet with representatives from Eastern countries, scientists from various countries who are aware of their responsibilities in the face of the threat of atomic warfare, trade union workers of various tendencies and representatives of major trade union organizations, religious figures belonging to Catholicism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism, and entrepreneurs and cultural figures concerned with the restoration and development of economic and cultural exchanges between nations.
    These men and women come from seventy or eighty countries. They speak all the different languages ​​of the world. They belong to all different races. They are influenced by all kinds of different ideologies. They spread all kinds of different beliefs and philosophies. But they are all concerned with the same thing, which is the maintenance of peace.
    The Helsinki Congress is being held after several major events. The situation in Asia, marked by the Bandung Conference, where representatives of Asian and African countries met and reached agreements for the first time. There is no doubt that the will of the Asian and African peoples to safeguard independence, ensure security, and cooperate peacefully will be reflected in the Helsinki Congress.
    The Helsinki Congress will also bring together representatives from other countries and other continents. In the case of France, its delegation will have one hundred and fifty members, with Edouard Herriot, Honorary President of the French National Assembly, serving as the Honorary Head of the delegation, and the delegation members will include members of parliament from various political parties.
    In addition to the Bandung Conference, several other significant events have occurred recently: the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, which has become an important factor in European security. The Soviet Union, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom have announced that they will hold talks. The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia held talks and issued important declarations.
    However, despite these new victories for the forces of peace, extremely serious threats still exist, such as the increasingly evident pressure to prevent governments of major countries from negotiating agreements; the resistance to preventing the People's Republic of China from obtaining its due position in the United Nations Organization continues to exist; the ratification of the Paris Agreements promotes German rearmament and the division of Europe; the arms race and the preparation for atomic warfare are still underway, and some responsible military leaders, and even politicians, are openly declaring the use of these weapons.
    Therefore, the World Peace Congress is being convened at a time when the international situation is still very tense and diplomatic activities are frequent. In this situation, the convening of this congress is of great significance and can play a significant role in future events.
    Not only will the representatives of the existing peace movement attend this congress, but also the forces from other groups and organizations which, although not participating in the peace movement, share the same views as the peace movement in many respects. In short, the Helsinki Congress will be attended by representatives of various opinions, which are currently developing in various countries in the direction of solutions on which peace depends.
    This public opinion, under the impetus of the peace movement, was expressed so powerfully not long ago that those who advocated the use of atomic weapons in Korea retreated after it, and it forced the governments that refused to end the Korean War and the Indochina War to implement a ceasefire.
    The World Peace Congress is the expression of this public opinion. The World Peace Congress will open the way for mutual understanding and rapprochement among the peoples of all countries, to ensure the security of all nations on the basis of respect for the independence of all nations, to prohibit nuclear weapons, to reduce armaments, and to defend world peace.

    世界和平大会
    世界和平理事会总书记  让·拉斐德
    世界和平大会几天后就要在赫尔辛基开幕了。世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议为召开这个大会曾于六个月前发出一项号召。世界和平理事会的号召在各国人民中间获得了极广泛的反应，得到了男男女女的支持。这些男男女女就是参加目前反对准备原子战争运动的各国的男男女女，就是四亿多个签名要求禁止核子武器的中华人民共和国的男男女女。
    召开世界和平大会的号召也在全世界所有别的和平力量中间获得了很大的反响，获得了许许多多普通人的衷心拥护，获得了代表着无数性质不同但今天正为和平而行动起来的团体、组织和政治派别的著名人士的参加。
    现在，第一批代表团已在去赫尔辛基的途中了。这些代表团的代表是由人民选出的，他们包括愿意与东方各国代表会面的西方国家的国会议员和政治家，面对原子战争威胁而意识到自己责任的各国科学家，各种不同倾向的工会工作者和各大工会组织的代表，属于天主教、基督教、回教和佛教的宗教人士，关心恢复和发展各民族间的经济文化交流的企业家和文化界人士。
    这些男男女女来自七、八十个国家。他们讲着全世界所有的不同的语言。他们属于各种不同的种族。他们受着各种不同的思想意识的影响。他们传布着各种不同的信仰和哲学。但是，他们都关心同一件事，就是和平的保持。
    赫尔辛基大会正举行在几件大事件之后。亚洲的局势，万隆会议是个标志，在那里，亚非各国的代表第一次会了面和取得了协议。毫无疑问，亚非各国人民所表达的维护独立、保证安全与和平合作的意志一定会反映在赫尔辛基大会上。
    赫尔辛基大会也将集合其他各国、其他各洲的代表。以法国而言，它的代表团将有一百五十个成员，由法国国民议会名誉议长赫里欧任代表团名誉团长，代表团成员中将有各政党的议员。
    除万隆会议外，在最近一个时期还发生了其他几件意义重大的事件：成为欧洲安全的一个重要因素的奥地利国家条约签订了。苏、美、法、英宣布将进行会谈。苏联和南斯拉夫举行了会谈并发表了重要的宣言。
    但是，尽管和平力量获得了这些新胜利，极端严重的威胁仍存在着，例如企图阻止各大国政府谈判协议的压力正日益彰著；阻碍中华人民共和国在联合国组织内取得应有地位的阻力继续存在；巴黎协定的批准促进了德国重新武装和欧洲分裂；军备竞赛和原子战争的准备还在进行，而一些负责的军事领袖们，甚至政治家公开宣布要运用这些武器。
    因此，世界和平大会正召开在国际局势还十分紧张、外交活动正频繁的时候。在这种情况下，这次大会的召开是有着重大的意义的，它对今后的事件是能起很大的作用。
    这次大会，不但有现有的和平运动的力量代表出席，而且还有别的力量。这些是来自虽然并不参加和平运动而在许多方面同和平运动看法一致的团体组织的力量。总之，出席赫尔辛基大会的将有各种不同舆论的代表，这些舆论目前在各国正朝着和平赖以保证的解决办法的方向发展。
    这种公众舆论在和平运动推动下，不久以前曾表达得如此有力，致使主张在朝鲜使用原子武器的人为之后退，它迫使拒绝结束朝鲜战争、印度支那战争的政府实行停战。
    世界和平大会就是这种舆论的表现。世界和平大会将为各国人民的互相了解和接近、在尊重各民族独立的基础上保证各民族的安全、禁止核子武器、裁减军备和保卫世界和平打开前进的道路。
