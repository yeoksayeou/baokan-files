    The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Xikang Province was held in Ya'an from May 11 to June 1, 1955.

    The meeting read and discussed the important documents of the National Congress of the Party, and also listened to and discussed two reports of the CPC Xikang Provincial Committee on the economic construction tasks and ethnic work of Xikang Province in 1955.

    During the discussion, the meeting fully developed criticism and self-criticism. In addition to group discussions, 77 representatives spoke at the plenary session. The meeting unanimously endorsed the resolutions of the National Congress of the Party, and believed that the formulation of the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of National Economy was timely and correct. This plan is a major step towards realizing the Party's general line during the transition period, and it pointed out the way for the people of the whole country to work hard. The meeting held that the class struggle during the transition period was more complex and intense, and the conspiracy of the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance was a sharp manifestation of the intense class struggle within the Party. The speakers unanimously angrily condemned the anti-Party crimes of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, and believed that the crushing of the Gao and Rao anti-Party alliance was a decisive victory in the history of the Party.

    The two reports of the CPC Xikang Provincial Committee on the economic construction tasks and ethnic work of Xikang Province in 1955 were unanimously approved by the meeting. The meeting summarized the achievements in the past work, and examined the shortcomings and errors. The meeting held that the development of the agricultural cooperation movement in the Han areas of Xikang Province was healthy and normal, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for 9.6% of the total number of peasant households in the Han areas. However, some cooperatives did not adequately implement the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, and there were simple and crude phenomena in the establishment of the cooperatives. The organization of some cooperatives was impure, and the leadership of the cooperative movement should be further strengthened in the future.

    The meeting held that the work of unified purchase and sale of grain in the past few years had achieved great results, but the erroneous phenomenon of issuing grain purchase certificates indiscriminately and blindly supplying those who should not be supplied in the unified sale was very serious. At present, the work of rectifying the unified sale of grain in rural areas should continue.

    The meeting pointed out that the ethnic work in the past few years had achieved results, but there were also shortcomings and errors, such as the ideological remnants of Han chauvinism and local nationalism, as well as the subjective and rash adventurist thinking reflected in various tasks. The meeting achieved a clearer and more unified understanding of the basic principles and main policies for developing production and trade, training cadres, building the Party, and united front work in ethnic areas in the future.

    Finally, the meeting unanimously adopted the resolution on endorsing the resolution of the National Congress of the Party and the resolution on the two reports of the CPC Xikang Provincial Committee. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西康省举行第二次党代表会议
    中国共产党西康省第二次代表会议五月十一日到六月一日在雅安举行。
    会议阅读和讨论了党的全国代表会议上的各项重要文件，还听取和讨论了中共西康省委员会关于西康省一九五五年度经济建设任务和民族工作的两个报告。
    会议在讨论中充分开展了批评和自我批评，除小组讨论外，在全体会议上发言的有七十七个代表。会议一致拥护党的全国代表会议的决议，认为发展国民经济的第一个五年计划草案的制定，是适时和正确的，这个计划是实现党在过渡时期总路线的一个重大步骤，它为全国人民指出了努力的途径。会议认为，过渡时期阶级斗争是更加复杂和激烈了，高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的阴谋，就是激烈的阶级斗争在党内的一个尖锐表现。发言的人一致愤怒斥责高岗、饶漱石的反党罪行，并认为高、饶反党联盟的被粉碎是党的历史上的有决定意义的胜利。
    中共西康省委员会关于西康省一九五五年度经济建设任务和民族工作的两个报告，得到会议的一致同意。会议总结了过去工作中的成绩，检查了缺点和错误。会议认为西康省汉族地区农业合作化运动的发展是健康和正常的，入社农户已占汉族地区总农户百分之九点六。但是有些合作社对自愿互利政策贯彻不够，建社中有简单粗糙现象；有些社的组织不纯，今后应继续加强对合作化运动的领导。
    会议认为过去粮食的统购统销工作取得了很大成绩，但在统销中乱发购粮证，不该供应的也盲目供应的错误现象是很严重的，目前仍应继续整顿农村粮食的统销工作。
    会议指出几年来的民族工作是有成绩的，但也存在缺点和错误。如在各项工作中表现出来的大民族主义和地方民族主义的思想残余，以及急躁冒进的主观主义思想。会议对今后在民族地区发展生产贸易、培养干部、建党工作和统一战线工作等基本方针和主要政策，取得了更加明确和统一的认识。
    会议最后一致通过关于拥护党的全国代表会议的决议的决议和关于中共西康省委员会两个报告的决议。（新华社）
