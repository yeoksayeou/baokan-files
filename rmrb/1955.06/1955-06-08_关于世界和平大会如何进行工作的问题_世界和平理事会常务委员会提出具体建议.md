Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, June 7th (TASS dispatch) – A communiqué issued by the Secretariat of the World Peace Council indicated that, according to statistical data up to June 1st, nearly two thousand delegates from seventy-five countries will participate in the World Peace Congress.

The communiqué stated that some social figures willing to participate in this Congress have expressed their view that, in order for the Congress to be successful, there must be a free exchange of opinions and principled discussions. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council has formulated the following suggestions:

	I. The rules of procedure for the Congress can only be finalized by all participants.
	II. The most pressing issues of the moment, such as disarmament and the issue of atomic weapons, military blocs, the security and cooperation of nations, independence and the maintenance of peace, will be the main topics of discussion at this Congress.
	III. In organizing the work of the Congress, attention should be paid to ensuring that specific issues can be thoroughly discussed. Therefore, it is proposed that the work of the Congress be conducted in the form of plenary sessions and group sessions. Speeches can be made at the plenary sessions, and reports can be made on the issues stipulated in the agenda of the Congress. Various issues can be discussed in detail in the group sessions and panel discussions.

The aim of the Congress is not to pass resolutions by a majority vote, but to strive to find a basis for agreement on various international issues among representatives with different views and interests.

Judging from prior consultations and the representativeness of the people participating in the Congress, it can be said that the conditions for the success of the Congress have already been created.

The communiqué concluded by pointing out that the World Peace Congress will contribute to the peaceful resolution of international issues that are causing tension and will make an important contribution to the establishment of international cooperation that the people of all countries are striving for.

    关于世界和平大会如何进行工作的问题
    世界和平理事会常务委员会提出具体建议
    新华社七日讯　据塔斯社维也纳六日讯：世界和平理事会书记处发表的公报指出，根据截至六月一日为止的统计材料，将有七十五个国家的将近二千名代表参加世界和平大会。
    公报说，某些愿意参加这次大会的社会人士表示，他们认为，要使大会获得成功，必须在大会上能够自由交换意见并且展开原则性的讨论。因此，世界和平理事会常务委员会拟定了下面的建议：
    一、大会的议事规则只能由全体参加会议的人来最后确定。
    二、当前最紧要的问题，如裁军和原子武器问题，军事集团，各国的安全和合作问题，独立和维护和平问题，将是这次大会讨论的主要题目。
    三、在组织大会工作时，应注意使一些专门问题能够得到透彻的讨论。因此，提议大会的工作可以采取全体会议和小组会议的形式来进行。在全体会议上可以发表演说，可以按照大会议程上所规定的问题作报告。在小组和分组会上可以详细讨论各种问题。
    大会的目的不在于以多数票通过一些决议，它将致力于在具有不同见解和利益的代表中间寻求就各种国际问题达成协议的基础。
    从事先的会商和这次参加大会的人的代表性来看，可以说已经创造了大会成功的条件。
    公报最后指出，世界和平大会将有助于和平解决造成紧张局势的国际问题，并且将对建立各国人民所争取的国际合作作出重要的贡献。
