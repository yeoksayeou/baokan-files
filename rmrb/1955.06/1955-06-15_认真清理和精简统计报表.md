    Seriously Clean Up and Streamline Statistical Reports
    Kong Sang

    Currently, the phenomenon of excessive statistical reports is quite common, both in central-level agencies and local agencies. According to the information grasped by the State Statistical Bureau, the current statistical reports of the central ministries have generally increased significantly compared to after the 1953 report cleanup. Some ministries, such as the Ministry of Light Industry, have more than doubled, increasing from the original 83 types to 293 types. Too many statistical reports greatly increase the burden on grassroots units for filling them out. In local areas, the proliferation of rural survey statistical reports is even more serious.

    Too many statistical reports not only fail to guarantee the accuracy of statistical figures but also hinder production work and other important work. They not only promote the expansion of institutions, wasting a large amount of manpower and resources, but also contribute to the development of bureaucracy and paperwork. Therefore, the rectification of staffing and the improvement of agency work are closely related to the work of streamlining statistical reports. It is necessary to conduct another cleanup and streamlining of statistical reports, and to make this work an important part of the staffing rectification work.

    After the start of the staffing rectification work, the State Statistical Bureau and the central ministries have successively launched inspections and cleanups of statistical reports. Some ministries have already achieved initial results. For example, the Ministry of Railways basically completed this work in a short period of half a month, deciding to abolish more than 36 percent of the original reports. The reason why the Ministry of Railways cleaned up quickly and achieved great results is that the ministry closely integrated it with the staffing rectification work, leading staff personally took charge, and established report cleanup working groups within the ministry and its directly subordinate administrations. Through these working groups, they studied and determined the principles, scope, and methods of the cleanup. In specific practices, the cleanup working group formulated a brief survey form on the filling and utilization of existing statistical reports and distributed it to the administrations. After mass discussions, it was clarified which statistical reports could not be filled out at all and which were filled out but never or rarely used. Then, those statistical reports that could not be filled out at all or were dispensable were canceled. In this way, the conservative thinking of some staff members who were "reluctant to part with" them could be overcome, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of streamlining the reports. The experience of the Ministry of Railways is worth learning from by all units.

    Up to now, many departments have not paid enough attention to the work of cleaning up and streamlining statistical reports. Some departments have not even started, and some departments have started, but the leading staff do not personally take charge, and they are hesitant about which statistical reports should be retained and which should be canceled. They have not criticized the conservative thinking of some staff members who are "unwilling to abandon" them. This situation must be changed. All regions and departments, especially the national statistical system and the central business departments, should, based on the experience of the Ministry of Railways, conscientiously grasp the principles of need and possibility on the basis of staffing rectification, earnestly carry out the work of streamlining statistical reports, and be sure to complete this work within a short period of time, and cancel all the survey statistical reports that are dispensable. Enable the necessary statistical work to be carried out effectively and further improve the quality of statistical data.

    认真清理和精简统计报表
    孔桑
    目前，无论在中央一级机关中或地方机关中，统计报表过多的现象是相当普遍的。从国家统计局所掌握的情况看来，中央各部的现行统计报表，一般反而比一九五三年清理报表后增加很多，有的部，如轻工业部竟增加了两倍半以上，即由原来的八十三种增加到二百九十三种。统计报表太多，就大大增加了基层单位填报报表的负担。而在地方上，农村调查统计报表的繁多情况则更为严重。
    统计报表多了，不但不能保证统计数字的准确，而且妨碍生产工作和其他重要工作的进行；不但促使机构庞大，浪费了大批人力物力，同时又助长了官僚主义和事务主义的发展。所以，整顿编制、改进机关工作是同精简统计报表工作密切相关的，这就有必要再进行一次清理和精简统计报表的工作，并把这一工作作为整编工作的一个重要部分。
    在整编工作开始以后，国家统计局和中央各部都先后展开了统计报表的检查和清理工作。有的部并已获得了初步成就。例如交通部在短短半个月的时间内就基本上完成了这一工作，决定废除的统计报表达原有报表的百分之三十六以上。交通部所以清理得快，成绩大，是因为这个部紧密地结合整编工作来进行的，领导工作人员亲自掌握，并且成立了部内的和各直属管理局的报表清理工作组，通过这些工作组，研究并确定清理原则、清理范围和清理方法等问题。在具体做法上，由清理工作组拟制了一种简要的现行统计报表填报和利用情况的调查表，发给各管理局，经过群众讨论，弄清楚哪一些统计报表是根本填报不上来的，哪一些是虽然填报上来，然而从未利用或利用很少的。然后，对那些根本填报不上来的，或者可有可无的统计报表，都加以取消。这样，就能克服某些工作人员那种“难割难舍”的保守思想，从而保证了精简报表的顺利进行。交通部的这个经验，是值得各单位学习的。
    到目前为止，许多部门对清理和精简统计报表工作还不够重视，其中有的部门根本还没有开始动起来，有的部门虽然动起来了，但领导工作人员不亲自掌握，对哪些统计报表应该保留，哪些应该取消犹疑不决，对于某些工作人员的“舍不得废弃”的保守思想未加批判。这种情况是必须加以改变的。各地区、各部门，首先是国家统计系统和中央各业务部门，应根据交通部的经验，在整编机构的基础上，切实掌握需要和可能的原则，认真地开展统计报表的精简工作，并且一定要在短期间内做完这一工作，把可要可不要的调查统计报表一律取消。使必要的统计工作能够有效地进行，并进一步提高统计资料的质量。
