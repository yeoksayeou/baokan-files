Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: According to the Romanian News Agency, Bucharest: "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" states in its editorial titled "A Great Contribution to the Cause of Maintaining and Strengthening Peace": The joint declaration of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments is a document of great international significance. This declaration is a noteworthy contribution to strengthening the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, peacefully resolving international disputes, and promoting understanding between countries and between peoples.

The editorial points out: Aggressive reactionary forces once hoped that the talks would fail. They tried their best to distort the situation of the talks, to minimize the importance of the talks, and to slander the foreign policies of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

The results of the Belgrade talks prove that the friendly relations and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia will be strengthened and further developed.

It is in the interests of the working class of all countries, and in the interests of the entire international workers' movement.
