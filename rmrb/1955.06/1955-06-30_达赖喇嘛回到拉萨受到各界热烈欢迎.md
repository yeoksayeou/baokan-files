At the welcoming rally, Fan Ming delivered a welcoming speech, saying: Last summer, we warmly sent off the Dalai Lama to Beijing to attend the First Session of the First National People's Congress, carrying the Tibetan people's love for the motherland; today, we warmly welcome the Dalai Lama back with the care of the people of the whole country. On behalf of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, I would like to express a warm welcome to the Dalai Lama's return. We pay our respects to the achievements of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini in the capital of the motherland, Beijing. He said: Let us unite more closely, and under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, and with the close unity of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini, work harder to gradually develop the political, economic, and cultural aspects of Tibet, and build a prosperous and happy Tibet.

The Dalai Lama delivered a speech to the welcoming masses from all walks of life. Then, he rode in a sedan chair through the welcoming crowd. Farmers and herdsmen who came from the suburbs performed dances for the Dalai Lama, and incense was burned on both sides of the city streets.

On his way from Qamdo to Lhasa on June 12, the Dalai Lama was welcomed by monks and lay people along the way. He also listened to work reports from the heads of Bomi and Gongbu areas.
