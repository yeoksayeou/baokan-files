Improve the Management of Mechanical Irrigation Stations
Yan Mingxiang

    In order to alleviate the threat of drought to agricultural production, and with the vigorous development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, from 1952 to 1954, in addition to building a large number of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, Shanxi Province also built six mechanical irrigation stations. Although this work is still in its infancy, it has been warmly welcomed by the peasants. For example, after the "May 1st" Mechanical Irrigation Station was established in Hepai Village, Luan County, the villagers said: "We never dreamed that we could bring the Zhang River water to land three zhang high. Now that we have installed water pumps, we are no longer afraid of the threat of drought." The establishment of mechanical irrigation stations has further enhanced the peasants' confidence in building a socialist society and promoted the development of agricultural collectivization.

    However, in recent years, a serious problem has existed in the mechanical irrigation stations in Shanxi Province: mechanical equipment has generally not been fully utilized. The new mechanical equipment installed at the Linfen State Farm Mechanical Irrigation Station is capable of irrigating 4,000 mu of farmland, but since the station was built in 1952, the area irrigated each year has been very small. In addition to the farm's 660 mu, only 300 to 400 mu of land benefited. The "May 1st" Mechanical Irrigation Station can irrigate 3,500 mu of land in Hepai, Wencun, and Dianshang villages, but in reality, it only irrigated 269 mu, and this year it only plans to irrigate 2,000 mu. In addition, the equipment efficiency of pumping stations in Xinjiang, Hejin, and Xiaxian has also not been brought into play.

    Where does the key to the problem lie?

    First, the Party and government leading organs in the areas where the irrigation stations are located do not have a sufficient understanding of the complexity of running mechanical irrigation stations and have not regarded running mechanical irrigation stations as an important water conservancy work. Therefore, once the project is completed, they rarely pay attention to the work of the mechanical irrigation stations. In fact, the successful construction of the station is only the beginning of the pumping station's work. What is more important is how to do a good job in organizing the masses to use water reasonably and establishing a water use system, as well as a series of irrigation management tasks. The Linfen Farm Mechanical Irrigation Station has not established a special management agency since its establishment. The irrigation station is only attached to the farm's sideline production team, with two people taking turns to operate the machines and one person concurrently managing affairs. The farm only summoned the relevant township heads and agricultural cooperative directors to talk about the management of the irrigation station at the time of construction, and no management committee was established afterward, nor was work such as organizing reasonable water use carried out. The farm believes that the purpose of building the station is mainly to take care of the farm. It is considered complete when the farm's land is watered, and they do not pay attention to the irrigation of the land that should benefit the masses. After the completion of the "May 1st" Mechanical Irrigation Station, the local leading organs rarely inquired about it. Therefore, this irrigation station, which can irrigate 3,500 mu, only irrigated 269 mu of land. Due to the lack of leadership in the daily management of the various irrigation stations, problems in mechanical operation technology, channel engineering, field surface leveling, and business management cannot be resolved in a timely manner. This not only limits the effectiveness of the machinery, but also creates a bad influence among the masses.

    Second, the irrigation stations lack skilled technicians who are familiar with the performance of the machinery. Some machines are not installed properly, and no timely inspection and maintenance work is carried out after installation. Therefore, the various stations have many mechanical accidents, low efficiency, and high operating costs. When the machinery at the Linfen Farm Mechanical Irrigation Station was first installed, it could run continuously for eight to ten hours; currently, the machinery cannot continue to run after every three to four hours of operation. Due to insufficient voltage and increased current, the rubber in the wires of electrical switches, meters, and transformer oil tanks has been burned. Due to the increase in power consumption and the reduction in water pumping, less land is irrigated, so the cost is relatively high. Last year, the station collected a total of 2,372.1 yuan in water fees, and the expenses for electricity, management fees, channel repair, and parts repair
  (the consumption of old machine oil, cotton yarn, and equipment depreciation were not included) amounted to 2,660.6 yuan, resulting in a loss of more than 200 yuan.
  The "May 1st" Mechanical Irrigation Station also has new equipment, but due to improper machine installation and the lack of understanding of machine performance by the people using the machinery, the machine could not run continuously after one hour of operation, resulting in an accident of burning the machine.

    Third, when constructing mechanical irrigation projects (including farmland water conservancy projects, civil engineering, and mechanical equipment), attention was not paid to close cooperation between all aspects. Attention was only paid to building machine rooms, and the excavation of branch and capillary canals and the leveling of fields were neglected, which also prevented the mechanical efficiency from being fully utilized. In the past four years, the Linfen Farm Mechanical Irrigation Station has only done a good job in branch and capillary canals and land leveling on the farm's 660 mu of land. Only 1,000 mu of the masses' land have opened branch canals and capillary canals, and the land has not yet been leveled; in addition, more than 2,000 mu of land that could benefit have not opened canals. Even the completed canals have many bends and do not meet the standards. There are no control gates at the water diversion points of the branch canals. Some branch canals use less water and have more water inflow, resulting in water waste; some branch canals need more water and have less water inflow, which is insufficient to meet the needs. After the stilling basin and aqueduct of the "May 1st" Mechanical Irrigation Station released water, water accumulated and leaked, repeatedly collapsing, affecting water flow. These lessons tell us that the construction of machine rooms, the installation of machinery, the increase in the opening of branch and capillary canals, and the leveling of land must be carried out in close coordination under a unified plan, otherwise the mechanical efficiency will not be fully utilized for a long time after the station is built.

    Now, the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has begun to pay attention to the above-mentioned problems. In order to adapt to the development needs of the mechanical irrigation cause and strengthen the leadership of the existing mechanical irrigation stations, this year it began to add a mechanical management unit to the irrigation management office. In response to the lack of leadership, poor management, and abandonment of the repair and excavation of branch and capillary canals and the leveling of field projects in mechanical irrigation, it was decided to vigorously consolidate and improve the built stations, accept past experiences and lessons, improve business management, establish and improve various systems (work system and water use system), gradually implement economic accounting, and rationally use existing equipment to increase the irrigation area. Combined with the improvement of other agricultural technologies, the unit area yield in the irrigation area will be increased. The Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has sent staff to the Linfen Farm Mechanical Irrigation Station to conduct inspections and rectifications, summarize experience, and promote overall improvement. At present, the technical problems such as machine installation and operation of the Linfen Farm Mechanical Irrigation Station and the "May 1st" Mechanical Irrigation Station have been improved, and the mechanical efficiency has been improved. Other work such as reorganizing the organization, increasing the opening of branch and capillary canals, and leveling the land are also underway. However, this is only one aspect of the matter. In order to rectify the existing mechanical irrigation stations and give full play to its role in increasing agricultural production, the Party committees and governments in the areas where the irrigation stations are located must attach importance to the work of the mechanical irrigation stations and strengthen their leadership and support.

    改善机械灌溉站的管理工作
    阎明祥
    为了解除干旱对农业生产的威胁，随着互助合作运动的蓬勃发展，从一九五二年到一九五四年，山西全省除兴办了大量的小型农田水利工程外，并建成了六处机械灌溉站。虽然这一工作还处在萌芽时期，但已受到了农民的热烈欢迎。例如“五一”机械灌溉站在潞安县河湃村建立起来以后，这村的农民说：祖祖辈辈做梦也没想到能把漳河水引到三丈高的土地上来；现在安上抽水机，再不怕干旱威胁了。机械灌溉站的建立，进一步提高了农民建设社会主义社会的信心，促进了农业合作化的发展。
    但是，几年来山西省的各处机械灌溉站中有一个严重问题——机械设备普遍没有充分发挥作用。国营临汾农场机械灌溉站装置的新式机械设备的效能，可以灌溉四千亩农田，但自一九五二年建站以来，历年灌溉面积很小，除农场六百六十亩外，群众的受益田仅有三、四百亩。“五一”机械灌溉站可灌溉河湃、温村、店上三村的土地三千五百亩，但实际上只灌溉了二百六十九亩，今年也只计划灌溉二千亩。此外，新绛、河津、夏县等地的抽水机站的设备效能也未发挥出来。
    问题的关键在哪里呢？
    第一是灌溉站所在地的党政领导机关对举办机械灌溉站的复杂性认识不足，没有把举办机械灌溉站当作一项重要的水利工作，因此当工程完成以后，就很少去过问机械灌溉站的工作。其实，建站成功，只是抽水机站工作的开始，更重要的是如何做好组织群众合理用水，建立用水制度等一系列的灌溉管理工作。临汾农场机械灌溉站自建站以来迄未设立专管机构。灌溉站只是附属在农场副业生产队内，由两个人轮流兼开机器，一人兼管事务。农场只在建站时召集有关乡乡长、农业合作社长谈了一下灌溉站的管理工作，过后并未建立管理委员会，也未进行组织合理用水等工作。农场认为建站的目的主要是照顾农场，农场的土地浇过了就算完事，对群众的应受益的土地的灌溉就不去理会。“五一”机械灌溉站建成后，当地领导机关就很少过问。所以这个能灌溉三千五百亩的灌溉站只灌溉了二百六十九亩地。由于各灌溉站的日常管理工作缺乏领导，在机械操作技术、渠道工程和田面整理以及经营管理等方面的问题，都不能及时得到解决。这不仅限制了机械效能的发挥，而且在群众中造成了不良影响。
    第二是灌溉站缺乏熟悉机械性能的技术工人，有的机械安装不合适，安装以后也没有及时进行检修等工作，所以各站的机械事故多、效率低、经营成本高。临汾农场机械灌溉站的机械初安装时，可连续转动八至十小时；目前机械每开动三至四小时就不能继续转动。由于电压不够，电流增加，发生了电闸、电表及变压油箱等处线内胶皮被烧的现象。由于耗电量增加，抽水量减少，浇地少，于是成本相对地提高。去年该站共收水费二千三百七十二元一角，支出电费、管理费、渠道修理、零件修配
  （消耗旧有的机油、棉纱和设备折旧费未计算在内），即达二千六百六十元六角，亏损二百多元。
  “五一”机械灌溉站也是新式设备，由于机器安装不合适和使用机械的人不懂机械性能，机器开动一小时后就不能连续转动，发生了烧毁机器的事故。
    第三是建筑机械灌溉工程（包括农田水利工程、土木工程和机械设备等）时没有注意使各方面密切配合，只顾修建机房，忽视了支斗毛渠开挖和田面整理，也使机械效能不能很好发挥。四年来，临汾农场机械灌溉站只在农场的六百六十亩土地上做好了支斗毛渠和土地平整等工作，群众的土地只有一千亩地开了支渠、毛渠，土地还没有平整；另外还有能受益的二千多亩地没有开渠。就是已修成的渠道也是弯道多，不合规格。支渠分水处没有节制闸控制，有的支渠用水少，进水多，水量浪费；有的支渠需水多，进水少，不足需要。“五一”机械灌溉站静水池和渡槽放水后，积水渗漏，屡次塌陷，影响水流。这些教训告诉我们，机房修建、装置机械、增开支斗毛渠、平整土地等项工程必须在统一规划下密切配合进行，否则建站后机械效能将长期不能充分发挥。
    现在，山西省水利局已开始注意了上述问题，为适应机械灌溉事业的发展需要和加强对已有机械灌溉站的领导，今年开始在灌溉管理处内增设了机械管理单位，针对机械灌溉中的领导不力、管理不善、放弃支斗毛渠的修挖和田面工程的整理等情况，决定大力巩固和提高已建的站，接受过去的经验教训，改善经营管理，建立和健全各种制度（工作制度和用水制度），逐步实行经济核算，合理使用现有设备，以增加灌溉面积，结合其他农业技术的改进，提高灌区单位面积产量。山西省水利局已派出工作人员到临汾农场机械灌溉站，进行检查整顿，总结经验，推动全面。目前临汾农场机械灌溉站和“五一”机械灌溉站机器安装和操作等技术问题已有改进，机械效能已有所提高。其他如整顿组织、增开支斗毛渠、平整土地等工作也正在进行。但是这仅是事情的一个方面，为了把现有的机械灌溉站整顿好，充分发挥它对农业增产的作用，灌溉站所在地的党委和政府必须把机械灌溉站的工作重视起来，加强对它的领导和支持。
