Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The issuance of the new Renminbi in our country has been successfully completed. As of May 10th, the currency circulating in urban and rural markets across the country is entirely the new Renminbi. According to regulations of the People's Bank of China, with the exception of old Renminbi notes of 10,000 yuan or more, which ceased to be exchanged from May 1st, all banks across the country will stop exchanging old Renminbi notes of 5,000 yuan or less from June 11th.

The issuance of the new currency began on March 1st. The People's Bank of China established more than 70,000 exchange agencies and proxy exchange agencies throughout the country; in remote areas, there were also mobile exchange organizations. Various localities organized a large number of reporters and propagandists to publicize the state's monetary policy to the broad masses of urban and rural residents. During the issuance of the new currency, the people of the whole country actively assisted the government in smoothly carrying out this work.

During the issuance of the new currency, national prices remained stable as usual. Taking the seven major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang as examples, if the general price index for January is taken as 100, it was 99.61 in both March and April. During this period, the rate of growth of people's savings was unprecedented. From the time the State Council issued the "Order on the Issuance of the New Renminbi and the Withdrawal of the Current Renminbi" on February 21st to the end of February, the savings of urban people in the People's Bank alone increased by more than 24 million yuan compared with mid-February. The rate of increase in savings in March reached the highest level in the years since liberation.

    新人民币的发行工作已经胜利完成
    新华社九日讯　我国发行新人民币的工作已经胜利完成。从五月十日起，全国城乡市场上流通的货币已全部是新人民币。按照中国人民银行规定，除五月一日起已停止收兑一万元以上的旧人民币外，从六月十一日起，全国各地银行停止收兑五千元以下的旧人民币。
    发行新币工作是从三月一日开始的。中国人民银行在全国各地设立了七万个以上的兑换机构和代理兑换机构；在偏僻的地区，还有流动兑换的组织。各地曾组织了大批报告员和宣传员，向广大城乡居民宣传了国家的货币政策。在发行新币中，全国人民积极协助政府顺利地作好了这一工作。
    在发行新币期间，全国物价平稳如常。以上海、天津、武汉、广州、重庆、西安、沈阳七大城市为例，如以一月份物价总指数为一百，三、四月份都为百分之九十九点六一。在这个时期，人民储蓄额增长的速度为前所没有过的。从二月二十一日国务院发布“关于发行新的人民币和收回现行的人民币的命令”到二月底的十天中，仅城市人民到人民银行储蓄的款项就比二月中旬增加了二千四百多万元，三月份储蓄额增加的速度，达到了解放后几年来的最高水平。
