Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The Indian Cultural Delegation held its first musical and dance performance tonight at the Beijing People's Theater. The performances were warmly welcomed and appreciated by artists and people from all walks of life in the capital. After each performance, the performers repeatedly took bows amidst sustained applause.

Before the performance began, an opening ceremony was held. The orchestra played the national anthems of China and India. Ding Xilin, Vice Minister of Culture and President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Chinese people to the Indian artists. He said that Chinese artists would definitely learn a lot from the wonderful performances of the Indian artists and wished the Indian artists a successful performance in China. Mr. Chanda delivered a reply, thanking the Chinese people for their warm welcome and expressing his belief that the friendship and cultural exchange between the people of China and India would be further developed through the Indian Cultural Delegation's visit and performance in China.

The performance began with the "Sino-Indian Friendship Song." This was followed by the song "Long Live the Friendship Between the People of China and India," sung enthusiastically by a choir of eight singers with a sonorous and mellow voice, singing warmly of the friendship between the people of China and India.

Tonight's performance featured a rich and colorful program of music, songs and dances by Indian artists. De V. Paluskar's rendition of "Prayer Song" and De Biswas's rendition of "Tagore's Ode" expressed simple emotions and praise for nature. "Punjab Song" showed a bold atmosphere, and the accompanying flute beautifully combined the soft melody and strong rhythm.

The performance of the Indian instrument "Seluda" and the accompanying music for the dance both showed different styles and simple atmosphere in Indian music. Its melody is beautiful, and its syllables are clear, reaching a high artistic level.

The performance of six dance programs included classical and folk dances popular throughout India. These dances, full of national style and strong breath of life, demonstrated the Indian people's love for their country's classical artistic traditions.

Ms. Indrani Rahman, who won the first prize in national dance at the International Art Competition of the 4th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival held in 1953, performed the Bharata dance tonight. The performer's dance posture was graceful and bright, the gestures were delicate and varied, and the expression was vivid and dramatic. After watching it, people felt more love for life and infinite longing for the future.

The audience warmly welcomed Ms. A. Guha's performance of the Kathak dance. The dancer not only has a beautiful and moving dance posture and graceful and rhythmic steps, but also the dancer, in harmony with the accompaniment of the music, makes the rhythmic ankle bells sometimes perform dullness, sometimes perform pleasure, and sometimes show terror and thrilling.

The lover's dance performed by Su Devi and Ru K. Singh praised the love of a young couple in a historical story and their loyalty to the people. The folk dance "Handkerchief Dance" depicts a group of young Indian men and women dancing the handkerchief dance to congratulate the bride and groom. This dance is popular among the working people in western India and expresses their joyous life. At the request of the audience with warm applause, the performers of the Handkerchief Dance performed it again.

The last program of the evening was the classical ballet "Reward." The actors used clear, easy-to-understand and dramatic expressions to show the Indian people's strong will for good to overcome evil.

After the performance, Chinese artists presented flower baskets to the Indian artists to pay their respects, and the entire audience expressed their heartfelt thanks to the Indian artists with warm and sustained applause.

Those who attended the performance included Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Secretary-General Xi Zhongxun, Director of the Second Office Lin Feng, Acting Minister of Culture Qian Junrui, Vice Minister Xia Yan, Vice Mayor of Beijing Wu Han, Indian Ambassador to China Raghunath and members of the Indian Medical Delegation currently visiting China, as well as diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China.

    印度文化代表团举行首次表演会
    新华社十二日讯　印度文化代表团今天晚上在北京人民剧场首次举行音乐歌舞表演会，表演的节目，受到了首都的艺术家们和各界人士的热烈欢迎和赞赏。在每一个节目演出后，表演者在历久不息的掌声中一再谢幕。
    表演会开始之前，举行了演出开幕仪式。乐队奏中国和印度两国国歌。文化部副部长、中印友好协会会长丁西林代表中国人民向印度的艺术家们致词欢迎。他说，中国的艺术家们一定会从印度艺术家们的精采演出中学到很多东西，并预祝印度艺术家在中国演出成功。钱达先生致答词，他感谢中国人民对他们的热情欢迎，并相信，通过印度文化代表团在中国的访问和演出，印中两国人民之间的友谊和文化交流事业必将得到进一步发展。
    表演会以“印中友好歌”开始。接着演唱的是“印中人民友好万岁”歌，由八位歌唱家组成的合唱队以宏亮圆润的歌喉，热情地歌唱着印中人民的友谊。
    今晚的表演会上，印度的艺术家们表演了丰富多采的音乐、歌舞节目。德·维·帕卢斯卡尔演唱的“祈祷之歌”、德·毕斯瓦斯演唱的“泰戈尔的颂歌”，表现了纯朴的感情和对大自然的赞美。“旁遮普之歌”表现出一种豪放的气息，伴奏的笛声把柔和的旋律和强烈的节奏美妙地结合在一起。
    印度乐器“瑟路达”的演奏和舞蹈的伴奏音乐，都同样地表现了印度音乐中不同风格和纯朴的气息。它的旋律优美，音节鲜明，达到了很高的艺术境界。
    六个舞蹈节目的表演，包括了流行在印度各地的古典舞蹈和民间舞蹈。这些富有民族风格的舞蹈，充满着强烈的生活气息，表现了印度人民对自己祖国古典艺术传统的热爱。
    曾在一九五三年举行的第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节国际艺术比赛中，获得民族舞蹈一等奖的印·拉赫曼女士今晚表演了婆罗多舞。表演者的舞姿优美爽朗，手势细致多样化，表情生动和富有戏剧性。使人看了以后，对生活更加热爱，对未来无限向往。
    观众热烈欢迎阿·古哈女士表演的卡塔克舞。舞蹈者不独舞姿优美动人、舞步婀娜而有节奏，而且舞者合着乐曲的伴奏，使有节奏的脚铃声，忽儿表演沉闷，忽儿表演愉快，忽儿又表现出恐怖和惊险。
    苏·德维和鲁·克·辛·辛格表演的恋人舞，歌颂了历史故事中一对青年男女的爱情和他们对人民的忠贞。民间舞蹈手帕舞，描写印度一群男女青年跳着手帕舞，向新娘新郎祝贺。这一舞蹈流行在印度西部的劳动人民中间，是表现他们欢乐的生活的。手帕舞的表演者在观众的热烈掌声要求下，又重新表演了一次。
    晚会最后一个节目是古典巴蕾舞剧“赏赐”，演员们用明朗易懂而富有戏剧性的表情，表现了印度人民对善良战胜邪恶的坚强意志。
    表演结束后，中国艺术家们向印度艺术家们献花篮致敬，全体观众以热烈的经久不息的掌声向印度艺术家们表示衷心地感谢。
