Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 20th -- Over a thousand staff members of the Tianjin cultural departments held a meeting on the 17th to further expose and denounce the counter-revolutionary sabotage activities carried out by the Hu Feng clique members in the cultural departments.

    Cui Yan, head of the Tianjin Amateur Art School, exposed at the meeting the fact that A Long, a special agent in the Hu Feng clique, had planned and organized to use the art school as a position for their counter-revolutionary activities. He said: In 1952, A Long first pulled over Wu Jiyun, who had been a Kuomintang reactionary officer, consistently opposed leadership, and served as the head teacher of the literature class in the art school. He said to Wu: "I know about your affairs. You are very brave. We respect you. I can help you if you have any difficulties in the future." In this way, Wu Jiyun joined forces with A Long, and A Long also sneaked into the literature class to lecture. They tried their best to exclude Party members and non-Party progressive writers from serving as lecturers. By 1954, most of the courses in the literature class were taught by Hu Feng members headed by A Long. The literature class of the art school almost became a position for Hu Feng members to spread reactionary ideology and a stronghold for attracting counter-revolutionary henchmen.

    Many people also used specific facts to expose the crimes of Hu Feng clique core members A Long, Lu Dian, Lu Li, and other Hu Feng members in carrying out counter-revolutionary activities by means of poetry recitals, lectures, reports, gatherings, and individual enticements. In 1954, one Hu Feng member held poetry recitals and get-togethers in more than 20 units, including the Cultural Center of the Fourth District of Tianjin and the Tianjin Amateur Art School, reciting poems by core members of the Hu Feng clique such as Lu Li and Lu Dian, spreading reactionary ideas in large quantities. Ai Wenhui, a cadre of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture's scriptwriting office, also exposed that Lu Li and others organized "Weekend Evenings" (later renamed "Literary Salon") at the end of 1951, using the decadent lifestyle of the bourgeois aristocracy to specifically attract some elements with reactionary ideas and corruption, spreading reactionary ideas, and carrying out anti-Party activities.

    Some people at the meeting also exposed some Hu Feng members who are still hiding in the cultural departments and have not yet confessed voluntarily. These Hu Feng members often viciously slandered and cursed the Party and Party leaders, as well as consciously creating chaos, carrying out sabotage activities such as provoking discord. The Hu Feng member hidden in the Tianjin Municipal Theater Troupe openly promoted Hu Feng's "chief director responsibility system," opposed ideological and political work in the troupe, abolished Party leadership, and attempted to turn the theater troupe into a kingdom of Hu Feng members.

    天津文化部门深入揭发胡风集团分子罪行
    新华社天津二十日电天津市文化部门一千多名工作人员在十七日举行大会，进一步深入揭发和声讨胡风集团分子在文化部门中所进行的反革命破坏活动。
    天津市业余艺术学校负责人崔岩在会上揭发了胡风集团中特务分子阿垅有计划、有组织地把艺术学校作为他们进行反革命活动的阵地的事实。他说：阿垅在一九五二年首先把曾经当过国民党反动军官、一贯反对领导、在艺术学校担任文学班主任的吴继云拉过去。他对吴说：“你的事情我知道，你很勇敢，我们尊重你，以后有困难，我可以帮助。”这样，吴继云便和阿垅结合起来，阿垅也就钻进文学班讲课。他们极力排斥党和非党进步作家担任讲师。到一九五四年，文学班大部分课程都是由以阿垅为首的胡风分子所担任，艺术学校的文学班几乎成了胡风分子散布反动思想意识的阵地和拉拢反革命爪牙的据点。
    很多人还用具体事实揭发了胡风集团骨干分子阿垅、芦甸、鲁藜和其他胡风分子利用诗歌朗诵会、讲课、作报告、聚会和个别拉拢等方式，进行反革命活动的罪行。在一九五四年，有一个胡风分子就在天津市第四区文化馆、天津市业余艺术学校等二十多个单位举办的诗歌朗诵会、联欢会等集会上，朗诵了鲁藜、芦甸等胡风集团骨干分子的诗，大量传播反动思想。市文化局剧本创作室干部艾文会还揭发了鲁藜等人在一九五一年底组织“周末晚会”（后来又改名为“文艺沙龙”），用资产阶级贵族的靡烂生活方式，专门拉拢一些有反动思想和腐化堕落的分子，散布反动思想，进行反党活动。
    还有一些人在会上揭发了一些暗藏在文化部门至今还未自动交代的胡风分子。这些胡风分子经常恶毒地诬蔑和谩骂党和党的领导干部，以及有意识地制造混乱、进行挑拨离间等破坏活动。暗藏在天津市话剧团的胡风分子，就公开宣传胡风的“首席导演负责制”，反对剧团中的思想政治工作，取消党的领导，企图把话剧团变成胡风分子的王国。
