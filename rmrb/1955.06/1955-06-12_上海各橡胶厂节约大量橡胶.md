Shanghai's more than 40 rubber factories, including state-owned, joint state-private, and private enterprises, produced more than 19 million pairs of rubber shoes from January to May this year, an increase of more than one million pairs compared to the same period in 1954, while using significantly less rubber. In the past five months, they saved 697 tons of rubber compared to the same period last year, enough to make more than 5.7 million pairs of rubber shoes.

The main method used by these factories to save rubber is to learn and promote advanced experiences. For example, after the advanced experience of "digging out the shoe collar skin" created by the state-owned Dafu Rubber Factory was fully promoted in various factories, more than 100 tons of rubber could be saved annually. From May 1954 to the present, these factories have accumulated more than 200 methods for saving rubber.

In the process of promoting advanced experiences and saving rubber, the factories encountered some difficulties in technical operations, but they were overcome by the workers. For example, when promoting the "digging out the shoe collar skin" method, the phenomenon of digging through the lining occurred frequently at the beginning due to unskilled operation, resulting in an increase in the number of substandard rubber shoes. Later, workers from various factories sent representatives to the Dafu factory to visit and learn their operating methods on the spot, and the rate of substandard products decreased month by month.

    上海各橡胶厂节约大量橡胶
    上海的国营、公私合营和私营的四十多家橡胶厂，从今年一月到五月共生产了一千九百多万双胶鞋，比一九五四年同期增加了一百多万双，所用的橡胶却大大减少。五个月来比去年同期节约了橡胶六百九十七吨，可以做五百七十多万双胶鞋。
    这些厂节约橡胶的主要方法是学习和推广先进经验。像国营大孚橡胶厂创造“挖光鞋口皮”的先进经验在各厂全面推广以后，一年就可以节约橡胶一百吨以上。从一九五四年五月份到目前这一年来，这些厂节约橡胶的办法已经积累了二百多种。
    各厂在推广先进经验、节约橡胶的过程中，在技术操作上曾经遇到了一些困难，但都被职工们克服了。像推广“挖光鞋口皮”的时候，开头因为操作上不熟练，普遍发生夹里挖穿等现象，造成胶鞋副号增加。后来，各厂职工派了代表到大孚厂去实地参观和学习他们的操作法，副次率就逐月下降。
