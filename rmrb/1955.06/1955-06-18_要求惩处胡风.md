    Demand Punishment for Hu Feng
    Li Shunda
    After reading in the newspaper about the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I was filled with extreme anger. Hu Feng, this petty thief, has been hiding in our revolutionary ranks for twenty years, and is ubiquitous. They spread bourgeois idealist reactionary thoughts everywhere, to corrupt our Party and disintegrate our revolutionary cause. They are conducting insidious and vicious attacks on the Party and the people in an organized, planned, and step-by-step manner; attempting to overthrow the people's regime and sabotage our socialist construction and our happy life. We must never allow them to exist and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng clique. I believe that the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's crimes against the Party and the people is a great victory for the Party and the people of the whole country. The struggle launched by the people of the whole country to crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a major event concerning the interests of the people of the whole country and the construction of a socialist society. Agricultural labor models and all farmers across the country should actively participate in this struggle with unparalleled anger to thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.
    The most resolute counter-revolutionary elements among the classes that have been eliminated and will be eliminated in the country, seeing that the people of the whole country are carrying out socialist construction in a vigorous manner, are trying every possible means to sabotage it in various ways. Not only has the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique appeared on the literary and art front, but there are also many counter-revolutionary elements on our agricultural front who are carrying out sabotage. Take our "Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative" in Xigou Township as an example. Recently, we also uncovered the sabotage case of counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Laiquan and Zhang Bianze. They once used the guise of "active" and "progressive" to deceive the eyes of the people and gain the trust of the leadership, and then secretly engaged in activities such as sowing discord, spreading rumors, and sabotaging production. At present, when farmers everywhere are engaged in the summer harvest, they must be a hundred times more vigilant, ensure that everyone is responsible for safeguarding the wheat harvest, and strictly prevent counter-revolutionary elements from sabotaging it.
    In the past, our rural cadres paid attention to agricultural production and did not pay enough attention to theoretical study. In the future, we must earnestly study political theory and enhance revolutionary vigilance. Only by mastering the weapon of Marxism-Leninism can we sharpen our eyes to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and timely discover and strike at the criminal activities of counter-revolutionary elements.
    I fully support the five resolutions of the Joint Expanded Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on handling the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. In particular, I am very satisfied with the request to revoke Hu Feng's qualification as a representative of the National People's Congress, because we must never allow this reactionary fellow to exist as a representative of our National People's Congress. The counter-revolutionary activities of Hu Feng, this petty thief, are purposeful, organized, and programmatic, and he is the deadly enemy of the people of the whole country. Merely revoking all his positions cannot completely eliminate public anger. Therefore, I request the government to thoroughly investigate all his criminal activities and political background and severely punish him according to law.

    要求惩处胡风
    李顺达
    当我从报纸上看到胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动以后，激起了我极大的愤怒。胡风这个蟊贼，二十年来，隐藏在我们革命队伍里，是无孔不入的，他们到处散布资产阶级唯心主义反动思想，来腐蚀我们的党，瓦解我们的革命事业。他们是有组织、有计划、有步骤地向党、向人民进行阴险毒辣的进攻；企图推翻人民政权，破坏我们的社会主义建设和我们的幸福生活。我们决不能让他存在，坚决把胡风集团彻底肃清。我认为胡风反革命集团反党、反人民的罪行被揭露，是党和全国人民的大胜利。全国人民开展粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争，是关系着全国人民利益的和建设社会主义社会的一件大事情。全国各地的农业劳动模范和全体农民，应该以无比愤怒的心情来积极参加这场斗争，彻底肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    国内已被消灭和将被消灭的阶级中最坚决的反革命分子，看到我们全国人民正在轰轰烈烈地进行社会主义建设，他们千方百计地从各个方面来进行破坏，不仅文艺战线上出现了胡风反革命集团，而且我们农业战线上也有不少反革命分子在破坏。就拿我们西沟乡“金星农林牧生产合作社”来说，最近也破获了反革命分子张来全、张扁则的破坏案件。他们曾打着“积极”“进步”的幌子，迷惑了人民的眼睛、骗得了领导的信任，然后偷偷摸摸地干些挑拨离间、造谣生事、破坏生产等活动。当前各地农民正在夏收的时候，更要百倍提高警惕，做到人人负责保卫麦收工作，严防反革命分子破坏。
    过去我们农村的干部重视了农业生产，在理论学习上不够。今后必需认真地学习政治理论，提高革命警惕。只有掌握了马克思列宁主义的武器，才能擦亮眼睛辨别真假，及时发现和打击反革命分子的罪恶活动。
    我完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议关于处理胡风反革命集团的五项决议。特别是对要求撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会的代表资格，我十分满意，因为我们全国人民代表大会的代表，也绝不能允许这个反动家伙存在。胡风这个蟊贼的反革命活动，是有目的、有组织、有纲领的，是全国人民的死对头，单撤销其一切职务是不能完全消除民愤的，因此我要求政府彻底追查其全部罪恶活动和政治背景，依法严惩。
