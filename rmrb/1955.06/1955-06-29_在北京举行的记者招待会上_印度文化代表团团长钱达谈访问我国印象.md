Xinhua News Agency, June 28th - Mr. Anil Kumar Chanda, head of the Indian Cultural Delegation to China, said at a press conference in Beijing today that the visit of the Indian Cultural Delegation to China is a beneficial way to strengthen cultural contact between the people of India and China.

Mr. Chanda said, "I bring greetings from the people of India to the people of China—greetings of goodwill and friendship."

He continued, "We Indians are watching the progress that the People's Republic of China is making in many fields with great interest. This visit has given us the opportunity to see some of the great construction work that is going on in this great country. We have seen many things that have touched and inspired us, and, if I may say so, I have also made many new friends during this visit to China.

"You know, we came here to introduce Indian music and dance to the Chinese people. A few months ago, we had the opportunity to welcome a similar Chinese delegation to our country, and we were very happy and honored to be able to directly learn about some Chinese music, dance, and drama. Your delegation's last visit to India was indeed enlightening. We saw many things that are the same in China and India. Now, at the invitation of the Chinese government, we are visiting various parts of this great country, and our Chinese friends have told us that they have also noticed many similarities between the Indian music they hear in our performances and the music of this country.

"It has been wonderful for the artists in our delegation to have the opportunity to visit music, dance, and drama institutions in Beijing, and I believe that what we have seen here will be of great benefit to us, because the governments and people of both our countries are very keen to have very close cultural contact between China and India. We are neighbors, we are good neighbors, we are good friends, and it would be a very beneficial thing to have more frequent contact between India and China, which would benefit ourselves, India, China, and the world. This cultural delegation is one of the ways to promote cultural contact between the people of India and China, and I believe that, as time goes on, we will have greater opportunities to send similar delegations to visit each other."

When asked about his impressions of China, Mr. Chanda said, "My mind is filled with various impressions." He mentioned three things, saying that these three things had a particularly deep impression on him personally.

He said, "First, the streets, sidewalks, train stations, factories, universities, houses, and other places we have seen in China are very clean.

"It is truly moving to see that the streets of Beijing and many other cities we have visited are very clean. I have never seen such cleanliness anywhere else in Asia.

"Another thing I should mention is the strong interest of the people across the country in sports and physical activities, because day after day you can see young men and women, and even older people, participating in sports and recreation. This is a great thing because, of course, everyone knows that a sound body is essential for a sound mind, and this remarkable development in people's activities is very encouraging.

"What impressed me the most is the enthusiasm of the younger generation to build their country, because, if I may say so, this is the most important thing."

Summarizing his impressions of Northeast China, especially the lives and construction work of the workers there, Mr. Chanda said:

"From what we have seen, we feel that the workers in the factories we visited are very enthusiastic. They compete with each other in their work. They want to do better than others in their work. We saw some workers' dormitories and workers' hospitals. The houses, courtyards, and the environment in which they live are very clean, which has impressed us deeply. I don't know what life was like in China before, but the people I have seen are happy, content, well-fed, and well-clothed.

"I was also very impressed that so many women are participating in industrial work, even working in shipyards and automatic rock drill factories in Shenyang. We saw female workers in almost every department of the factory. I was very pleased to learn that female workers receive the same wages and salaries, and that female workers are not discriminated against because of their gender.

"Intense construction work is going on everywhere. What surprised me the most was that you were able to build such huge buildings in such a short period of time—for example, that university in Shenyang. We heard that the huge school buildings there were built in two or three years. This is indeed a great achievement. The reason you are able to do this, I think, is entirely because the workers have a personal enthusiasm, they are inspired, because they are working for the benefit of their country, for the benefit of their people, and also for their own benefit."

Speaking about the Chinese dance and opera performances the Indian cultural delegation had seen, Mr. Chanda said that these programs were "technically perfect and performed very well." He added, "We consider it a special honor to have had the opportunity to see performances by Mei Lanfang and other famous actors."

Mr. Chanda also told reporters that Professor Raghu Vira, a famous Indian scholar currently visiting China, had discovered some Indian scriptures translated into Mongolian as well as many well-preserved Sanskrit classics in Shenyang.

Mr. Chanda mentioned the many similarities he had noticed between Chinese temples and monasteries and Indian temples and monasteries.

Mr. Chanda suggested that China and India should regularly send cultural delegations to each other, hold art exhibitions, and exchange scholars and students.

He mentioned the Chinese students who are currently studying in India. He said that a Chinese female student from the University of Bengal had achieved the first place in this year's exams.

Mr. Chanda introduced Dr. Marathe, the program director of the delegation, to the reporters. Dr. Marathe briefly introduced the situation of training young artists in India.

At the end of the press conference, Mr. Chanda said: "We have visited many cities that we knew about during our student days. Our visit has deeply moved us. We will stay in your hospitable country for another five or six weeks and visit some other cities. We hope that we will have the opportunity to return to China to relive the memories and friendships we made during this visit."

    在北京举行的记者招待会上
    印度文化代表团团长钱达谈访问我国印象
    新华社二十八日讯印度访华文化代表团团长阿尼尔·库马尔·钱达先生今天在一次记者招待会上说，印度文化代表团对中国的访问是加强印度和中国两国人民间的文化接触的有益方法。
    钱达先生说：“我带来印度人民对中国人民的问候——善意的和友谊的问候。”
    他接着说：“我们印度人非常关切地注视着中华人民共和国正在许多方面获得的进展。我们这次访问使我们有机会看到这个伟大的国家内正在进行着的一些伟大的建设工作。我们已经看到许多使我们感动和鼓舞的事情，如果我可以这样说的话，我在这次访问中国的期间也结识了许多新朋友。
    “你们知道，我们到这里来是来向中国人民介绍印度的音乐和舞蹈的。几个月以前，我们曾有机会欢迎一个类似的中国代表团到我国去，我们能够直接了解一些中国的音乐和舞蹈及戏剧，这是使我们非常高兴和荣幸的事。贵国代表团上次对印度的访问的确是启人耳目的事。我们看到许多中国和印度相同的事情。现在，我们应中国政府的邀请，在这个伟大的国家各处参观，我们的中国朋友们告诉我们说，他们也注意到他们在我们演出的节目中听到的印度音乐同这个国家的音乐有许多相似之点。
      “我们这个代表团中的艺术家们有机会参观北京的音乐、舞蹈和戏剧机构，真是太好了，我相信，我们在这里所看到的将对我们有很大的益处，因为我们两国的政府和人民都热烈希望在中国和印度之间有极密切的文化接触。我们是邻居，我们是好邻居，我们是好朋友，并且要在印度和中国之间有更普遍的接触，则这是一件非常有益的事情，这对我们自己有益处，对印度，对中国和对世界都有益处。这个文化代表团是促成印度和中国两国人民的文化接触的方法之一，并且，我相信，随着时间的推移，我们将有更大的机会来派遣类似的代表团互相进行访问。”
    钱达先生在回答一个关于他对中国的印象的问题时说，“我的头脑充满了各种印象。”他提出了三件事情，他说，这三件事情对他个人有着特别深刻的印象。
    他说，“首先，中国街道，人行道，火车站，工厂，大学，房屋，以及我们曾经看过的其他地方都非常清洁。
    “看到北京和我们所访问过的许多其他城市的街道非常清洁实在是使人感动的。我从来没有在亚洲的任何其他地方看到过这种清洁的情况。
    “我应提到的另一件事是全国人民现在对运动和体育的强烈兴趣，因为一天到晚，你都可看到青年男女甚至年纪较大的人在参加运动和娱乐。这是一个很伟大的事情，因为，当然，大家都清楚知道，有健全的体格才能有健全的头脑，人民活动的这种了不起的发展是十分令人鼓舞的。
    “使我印象最深的，是年青一代建设他们的国家的热情，因为，如果我可以这样说，这是最重要的事情。”
    钱达先生在总结他对中国东北的印象、特别是对那里的工人的生活和他们的建设工作的印象时说：
      “从我们所看到的，我们感到我们所参观的工厂的工人非常热情。他们在他们的工作中彼此竞赛。他们想在他们的工作中做得比别人好。我们看到一些工人宿舍和工人医院。房屋、院子和他们所居住的环境都十分清洁，这实在给我们以很深的印象。我不知道从前中国生活的情况，但是我所看到的人是愉快的、满足的，吃得很饱，穿得很好。
      “我对于有这么许多妇女参加工业工作，甚至在造船厂和沈阳的自动风钻工厂工作，同样也感到印象很深刻。几乎在工厂的各个部门，我们都看到女工。我很愉快地得知女工们取得同样的工资和薪金，对女工们并不因为性别的关系而有所歧视。
    “到处都在进行紧张的建筑工作。使我感到最为惊奇的是你们竟能在这样短的时间内建起这样巨大的建筑物——例如，沈阳的那所大学。我们听说，那里的巨大校舍是在两三年内建筑起来的。这的确是一个巨大的成就。你们所以能够这样做，我想完全是因为工人们有一种切身的热情，他们受到了鼓舞，因为他们是在为他们国家的利益，为他们人民的利益，也是为他们自己的利益而工作。”
    在谈到印度文化代表团看过的中国舞蹈和歌剧表演时，钱达先生说：这些节目“技术上很完善，表演得非常好”。他又说：“我们能够有机会看到梅兰芳和其他著名演员的表演，我们认为是一种特别的荣幸。”
    钱达先生还告诉记者说，现在访问中国的印度著名学者拉古·维拉教授在沈阳发现了一些译成蒙古文的印度经文以及许多保存得很完整的梵文经典。
    钱达先生提到了他注意到的中国庙宇和寺院同印度庙宇和寺院的许多相似之点。
    钱达先生建议中印两国经常互派文化代表团，互办艺术展览会，并交换学者和学生。
    他提到现在在印度学习的中国学生。他说，孟加拉大学的一个中国女学生在今年的考试中取得了第一名。
    钱达先生向记者介绍了代表团的节目指导马拉太博士。马拉太博士简短地介绍了印度训练青年艺术家的情况。
    在记者招待会结束时，钱达先生说：“我们访问了许多我们在学生时代就知道的城市。我们的访问使我们衷心激动。我们将在你们好客的国家里再停留五六星期，还要访问一些其他的城市。我们希望我们将有机会再回到中国来重温我们在这次访问中留下的记忆和友谊。”
