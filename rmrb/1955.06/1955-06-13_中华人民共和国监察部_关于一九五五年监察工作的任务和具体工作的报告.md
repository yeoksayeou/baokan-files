Based on the general task of the state during the transition period and the Constitution, the basic task of supervision organs at all levels in the future must be to supervise administrative organs at all levels, state-owned enterprises and their staff to correctly implement the decisions and orders of the State Council, resolutely implement the state's policies and laws, earnestly complete the state plan, conscientiously cherish state property, and faithfully fulfill their responsibilities, in order to consolidate state discipline, ensure the thorough realization of the state's general task during the transition period, and ensure the smooth completion of the socialist construction and socialist transformation.

The central task of supervision organs at all levels in 1955 should be to supervise and inspect the implementation of the third annual plan of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, based on the above basic tasks and the main problems that have already been exposed in the organs and enterprises, and to inspect the reduction of staffing and streamlining of institutions in administrative organs and enterprises at all levels, and to supervise the observance of state discipline stipulated in the Constitution by administrative organs and enterprise staff at all levels. Oppose all kinds of serious waste and loss phenomena in economic construction; oppose embezzlement, theft, corruption, degeneration, as well as coercion, commandism, and violations of laws and regulations; oppose bureaucracy. Specifically:

I. Supervise and inspect whether administrative organs and enterprises at all levels and their staff faithfully implement the third annual national economic plan. Focus on inspecting more serious and prominent problems in industry, especially heavy industry and capital construction, as well as agriculture, transportation, commerce, and other departments. For this purpose:

1. In the industrial and capital construction sectors, focus on inspecting whether the product types, product and engineering quality, cost, and labor productivity targets stipulated by the state are completed. That is, it is necessary to check those serious waste and loss phenomena caused by only pursuing output value without considering needs and producing substandard and defective products, a large backlog of materials, blind construction, pursuing luxury and beauty in design, as well as unreasonable labor organization, underemployment and rush work. We must resolutely struggle against those who do not faithfully complete their tasks, but instead falsely report achievements, fabricate facts, and fraudulently obtain honors and bonuses;

2. In the agricultural sector, inspect whether administrative organs and their staff correctly implement the guidelines and policies for developing mutual aid and cooperation and various measures for agricultural production. Focus on inspecting the coercive orders, violations of laws and regulations committed by rural work cadres in the execution of various tasks;

3. In the transportation sector, check the failure to effectively complete the transportation plan, focusing on the phenomena of low transportation quality, chaotic organization, and lack of attention to safety;

4. In the commercial, foreign trade, and grain sectors, focus on inspecting the phenomena of backlog, unsalable goods, poor storage management, and chaotic commodity allocation and operation management that occur in the implementation of the commodity circulation plan.

II. Check whether administrative organs and institutions at all levels have earnestly implemented the State Council's decision on reducing staffing and streamlining institutions. In order to effectively complete the third annual national economic plan, it is necessary to save all manpower, material resources, and financial resources that can be saved, strengthen the forces of economic construction, promote the improvement of the work of organs, and better lead the completion of various construction tasks. Supervision organs at all levels must assist administrative organs and institutions at all levels in implementing the spirit of the State Council's reduction of staffing and streamlining of institutions, and check the existing institutions and staffing from top to bottom. When checking, it is not only necessary to deeply expose problems, but also to seriously study how to solve them; it is not only necessary to achieve streamlining of institutions and rational use of talent, but also to achieve the purpose of improving leadership, improving work, establishing and improving systems, overcoming bureaucracy, and improving work efficiency.

III. Supervision organs at all levels must regularly supervise the observance of state discipline stipulated in the Constitution by administrative organs and enterprise staff at all levels. In order to supervise the faithful execution of the state plan by administrative organs and enterprise staff at all levels, it is necessary to maintain the state's centralized and unified leadership, give play to the supervisory role of the broad masses of people over them, protect the people's democratic rights, oppose undermining centralized and unified leadership, and oppose suppressing criticism and retaliation. Through checking and handling various cases, adopt various methods to continuously conduct discipline education for the broad masses of cadres.

When carrying out the above tasks, supervision organs at all levels and all supervision personnel must respect the local Party organizations and obey the leadership of the Party committees at the same level, and frequently report situations to the Party committees, and ask for instructions and reports. At the same time, they should closely combine their work with the Party's supervision committees and the People's Procuratorate at all levels, and earnestly rely on various mass organizations to regularly report and expose the erroneous behaviors of organs and staff.

In order to further exert the strength of the supervision organs, a policy of prepared, planned, and focused, concentrated supervision and inspection must be adopted in work methods. At present, in order to effectively stop all kinds of serious waste and loss phenomena, protect state assets, and comprehensively complete the state plan, especially complete the product quality indicators and cost indicators, one or two projects should be selected in several units of one department or several units of several departments, and a certain amount of strength should be concentrated to conduct special inspections. Before the inspection, preparations such as understanding the situation, selecting cadres, and organizing forces must be made; after the inspection, the discovered problems must be comprehensively analyzed, and concrete and feasible suggestions must be put forward to help relevant departments improve their work. Personnel who seriously damage the state plan and seriously harm state assets should be seriously dealt with. When carrying out inspection work in rural areas, it is necessary to focus on the central tasks of the local Party committee and government at various periods, mainly focusing on the production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, and the unified purchase and sale of grain, oil, and cotton, as well as various tasks such as production and disaster relief, and conscription. One or two key counties and districts should be selected to check the coercive orders, violations of laws and regulations, and embezzlement and theft committed by cadres in the execution of tasks, and the situation should be reported to the Party and government leaders in a concentrated manner, and opinions should be put forward for timely and effective correction. The reasons for the errors should be analyzed, and responsibility should be investigated. According to the nature and severity of the errors, they should be treated differently. For general coercive orders, emphasis should be placed on education. Illegal and disciplined, and embezzlement and theft elements should be dealt with seriously.

In order to clarify the main tasks of supervision organs at all levels and strengthen the focus of work, there should be a specific division of labor: the Ministry of Supervision and the state supervision organs set up in the various financial and economic departments of the State Council should focus on supervising state-owned enterprises; the supervision bureaus of municipalities directly under the Central Government and municipalities divided into districts should focus on supervising local state-owned enterprises; the supervision departments of provinces (except for individual provinces) and the supervision offices of special administrative regions should focus on supervising the correct implementation of the State Council and the provincial people's committees' resolutions and orders on agricultural production centered on mutual aid and cooperation and the unified purchase and sale policies of grain, oil, and cotton by administrative organs at all levels below the province and special administrative region and their staff. The provincial supervision department must strengthen the leadership of the supervision institutions stationed in departments related to agricultural production and the supervision offices of the special administrative region. At the same time, it must also lead the work of the municipal supervision organs under its jurisdiction and the supervision institutions stationed in certain financial and economic departments under the province. When necessary, it will assist the Ministry of Supervision and the state supervision organs set up in the departments under the State Council to conduct inspections of state-owned enterprises.

In order to effectively complete the above tasks, the following tasks must be done well:

1. Further study and correctly promote the experience of supervision work on the Sino-Soviet Railway: In order to improve the level of supervision work and more effectively exert the role of supervision work, in 1955, the supervision organs and supervision personnel in the financial and economic departments and state-owned enterprises should further deeply study the basic spirit of the supervision work on the Sino-Soviet Railway, and its specific practices must be correctly promoted. Those who have already promoted it, such as the supervision organs of the railway, textile and other departments, should earnestly summarize their experiences, affirm their achievements, correct their shortcomings, carry forward their advantages, criticize incorrect understandings, and improve the quality of their work. Those who have not yet promoted it can gradually promote it with focus.

However, when learning and promoting the experience of supervision work on the Sino-Soviet Railway, it should be based on the specific conditions of each department to prevent mechanical application, greed for more and faster, and pursuit of form. All supervision organs that implement prior supervision should select main projects according to needs and implement them after approval by the higher-level supervision organs. At the same time, it must be pointed out that the purpose of learning and promoting the experience of supervision work on the Sino-Soviet Railway is to more effectively stop and overcome the many serious phenomena that already exist and the continuous accidents in state-owned enterprises, so it should never be relaxed due to the promotion of the experience of supervision work on the Sino-Soviet Railway. Inspections of these phenomena and major accidents.

2. Appropriately adjust the organization of supervision organs and gradually change leadership relations: With the strengthening of the central task of supervising economic construction and the adoption of the work policy of concentrated supervision and inspection, the organizational structure of supervision organs must also be appropriately adjusted, that is, the situation of excessive dispersion should be changed, the focus should be strengthened, and the leadership backbone should be strengthened. After the provincial supervision organs abolish the supervision organs of counties and cities without districts, they should appropriately strengthen the supervision organs of provinces, cities divided into districts, and special administrative regions, and select key counties to station supervision personnel. The financial and economic departments should shrink those overly dispersed, small, and unimportant enterprise supervision organs, and strengthen the supervision organs of large, important enterprises and capital construction units, but should prevent the phenomenon of blindly and rashly transferring cadres and shrinking institutions without preparation. When setting up and adjusting organizations, it must be based on the spirit of the state's reduction of staffing and streamlining of institutions and the current shortage of cadres, and strive for leanness and efficiency.

With the development of supervision work, it is necessary to clearly divide the responsibilities of the state supervision organs and the internal supervision organs of the business departments, and change the leadership relations, so that the higher-level state supervision organs can uniformly command and concentrate the use of forces. The Ministry of Supervision adopts two kinds of leadership relations for the state supervision organs set up in the departments under the State Council, namely: 1. Select one or two supervision bureaus (offices) with relatively sound institutions and a relatively solid foundation of work to try out vertical leadership; 2. The vast majority of supervision bureaus (offices) still maintain dual leadership. The existing supervision organs of certain departments are changed to internal supervision or inspection organs of the business departments, led by the respective departments, and the Ministry of Supervision only maintains contact with them or provides guidance on supervision business. The state supervision organs set up in various departments can implement vertical leadership over their subordinate supervision organs and supervision personnel stationed in enterprises. All central state-owned industrial and mining enterprises that are not led by local governments maintain contact with local state supervision organs, and when necessary, cooperate in work. In the departments and bureaus led by the provincial and municipal people's committees, the provincial and municipal state supervision organs station supervision personnel, who are under the leadership of the provincial and municipal state supervision organs, and maintain guidance relations with the state supervision organs set up in the departments under the State Council.

3. Vigorously cultivate and train cadres: Supervision work is an arduous and complex political and ideological work, and it is necessary to unremittingly fight against bourgeois ideology. Cadres engaged in supervision work must strive to improve their level of Marxism-Leninism theory and policy ideology, prevent and overcome subjective one-sidedness and formalism, humbly learn the necessary knowledge of economic construction and be familiar with the business of supervision work, and actively learn from advanced Soviet experience. Therefore, vigorously cultivating and training cadres has become one of the decisive conditions for improving my country's supervision work, and it is also an urgent task for supervision organs. Supervision organs at all levels must quickly take effective methods to cultivate and train cadres. The Ministry of Supervision plans to continue to hold three short-term training courses this year, training about 450 cadres, and assist the supervision bureaus set up in the various departments of the State Council to hold short-term training courses, training about 1,500 people in rotation. Provincial and municipal supervision organs should also train cadres in a planned way according to needs and possibilities. Through training, not only should the trainees' professional level be improved, but also their policy ideological level should be improved, and the purpose of understanding cadres and inspecting work should be achieved. At the same time, the theoretical and professional learning of in-service cadres should also be strengthened regularly, patiently leading them to study their business, study problems, help them overcome difficulties in their work, correct their ideological style, and small professional meetings can be held to specifically help cadres summarize their experiences, exchange experiences, and solve existing problems in their work.

4. Strengthen the work of punishment and handling of citizens' accusations and appeals: It must be recognized that seriously and cautiously handling cases of violation of state discipline and conscientiously and responsibly doing the work of handling citizens' accusations and appeals are the responsibilities of state supervision organs at all levels, and it is also an important aspect of maintaining state discipline. In the past few years, supervision organs at all levels have done a lot of work in this regard and achieved great results. In the future, the Ministry of Supervision and the supervision organs of provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities divided into districts should still manage the work of punishment and be responsible for reviewing cases of discipline violations by personnel appointed by the State Council and the people's committees of provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities divided into districts. The supervision organs of the various departments of the State Council and the various departments and bureaus of the provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities divided into districts should put forward opinions on the handling of the cases they have inspected and the appeal cases that they do not accept the punishment. After the competent department or the provincial or municipal people's committee or after the higher-level supervision organ reviews and reports to the higher-level administrative organ for approval, it will be implemented. If the opinions of the competent department and the people's committee at the same level are different, and the supervision organ believes that it must adhere to its own opinions, it can report to the higher-level supervision organ for resolution.

Regarding the handling of citizens' accusations and appeals, some supervision organs and a small number of cadres do not pay enough attention to it. They mistakenly believe that handling citizens' accusations and appeals is an unimportant "response to the door" work, and relying on citizens' accusations and appeals cannot solve any problems. Therefore, many cases are delayed and backlog, and no results are obtained for a long time. There are also some supervision organs in the financial and economic departments that only pay attention to the supervision and inspection of production and finance, and neglect the handling of citizens' accusations and appeals. This situation must be overcome. In order to improve the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to care about socialist construction and socialist transformation, and to give play to their supervisory role over state organs and staff, supervision organs at all levels must do a good job in handling citizens' accusations and appeals, and must actively directly investigate and handle several major cases. For the typical cases among them, they can be dealt with in a big way to educate cadres and the broad masses of people. At the same time, they should also regularly urge lower-level organs to handle citizens' accusations and appeals in a timely manner, and focus on helping lower-level organs study more serious cases, conduct inspections and handling, and help them overcome certain difficulties and obstacles in their work. When supervision organs at all levels encounter difficulties and obstacles that cannot be inspected and handled, they should immediately report them level by level, and higher-level organs should give strong support.

In order to continuously improve supervision work, supervision organs at all levels must strengthen political and ideological leadership for cadres. Conscientiously study the tasks, guidelines, and policies of the Party and the government at each period, timely arrange their own work, clearly explain the tasks and policies to cadres and lower-level supervision organs, and specifically guide them to implement them. After each work is completed, or within a certain period of time, in-depth inspection should be carried out, experiences and lessons should be summarized, successful experiences should be disseminated, shortcomings and errors in work should be criticized, and methods of correction should be pointed out. Leading cadres must also personally go deep into key points, cultivate typical examples, create experiences, and guide overall work. It is necessary to always pay attention to investigation and research, grasp the situation in all aspects, systematically and comprehensively study the problems found, put forward opinions on solving the problems, and report to the Party and government leaders to obtain instructions and support. We must also continuously educate all supervision work cadres, especially leading cadres, to be always vigilant, not to be proud and complacent because they have achieved a little success in their work, nor should they lose confidence because they have shortcomings or encounter difficulties in their work, and educate them to be modest and prudent, diligently and conscientiously loyal to their duties, and bravely adhere to the truth and adhere to principles. To this end, supervision organs at all levels should strictly abide by the principle of democratic centralism, effectively strengthen collective leadership, promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from bottom to top, listen to the opinions of lower-level supervision organs and cadres, understand their ideological situation and difficulties, and solve them in a timely manner, in order to improve cadres, improve leadership, and improve work.

    中华人民共和国监察部
    关于一九五五年监察工作的任务和具体工作的报告
    （一九五五年四月七日钱瑛部长在第四次全国监察工作会议上的报告）
    （一九五五年五月三十一日国务院全体会议第十次会议批准）
    根据国家过渡时期的总任务，根据国家的宪法，今后各级监察机关的基本任务必须是监督各级行政机关、国营企业及其工作人员正确地执行国务院决议命令，坚决地贯彻国家政策法令，切实地完成国家计划，认真地爱护国家财产，忠实地履行自己的职责，以巩固国家纪律，保证国家过渡时期总任务的彻底实现，保证社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利完成。
    一九五五年各级监察机关的中心任务应是根据上述基本任务和机关、企业当前已经暴露出来的主要问题监督和检查第一个五年计划第三年度发展国民经济计划的执行情况，并检查各级行政机关、事业机关紧缩编制精简机构的情况，及监督各级行政机关、企业工作人员遵守宪法规定的国家纪律。反对经济建设中的各种严重浪费损失现象；反对贪污盗窃、腐化堕落以及强迫命令、违法乱纪行为；反对官僚主义。具体的是：
    一、监督和检查各级行政机关、企业及其工作人员是否忠实执行第三年度国民经济计划。着重地检查工业，特别是重工业和基本建设，以及农业、交通运输业、商业等部门中较为严重和突出的问题，为此：
    1、在工业和基本建设方面，着重检查是否完成国家规定的产品种类、产品和工程质量、成本、劳动生产率指标。也就是要检查那些由于只追求产值而不根据需要及出产废品次品、大量积压物资、盲目施工、设计中追求豪华美观以及劳动力组织不合理、窝工赶工等而造成的严重浪费损失现象。必须坚决地与那些不忠实地完成任务，反而谎报成绩，弄虚作假，骗取荣誉和奖金的行为进行斗争；
    2、在农业方面，检查行政机关及其工作人员是否正确执行发展互助合作的方针政策和农业生产的各项措施。着重检查农村工作干部在执行各项任务中所发生的强迫命令、违法乱纪行为；
    3、在交通运输方面，检查不切实完成运输计划，着重检查运输质量低、组织混乱和不注意安全的现象；
    4、在商业、对外贸易和粮食方面，着重检查执行商品流转计划中所发生的积压、脱销和仓储保管不善，商品调拨和经营管理混乱的现象。
    二、检查各级行政机关、事业机关是否切实执行国务院关于紧缩编制、精简机构的决定。为了切实完成第三年度国民经济计划，就必须节省一切可以节省的人力物力财力，加强经济建设的力量，促进机关工作的改进，更好地领导完成各项建设任务。各级监察机关必须协助各级行政机关、事业机关贯彻国务院紧缩编制、精简机构的精神，从上而下的检查现有机构和编制的情况。检查时，不只是要深入地揭发问题，还要认真地研究如何解决问题；不仅要作到精简机构，合理使用人材，还要达到改善领导，改进工作，建立和健全制度，克服官僚主义，提高工作效率的目的。
    三、各级监察机关必须经常地监督各级行政机关、企业工作人员遵守宪法规定的国家纪律。为了监督各级行政机关、企业工作人员忠实地执行国家计划，就必须维护国家集中统一领导，发挥广大人民群众对他们的监督作用，保障人民民主权利，反对破坏集中统一领导，反对压制批评、打击报复的行为。通过检查处理各种案件，采取各种方法不断地对广大干部进行纪律教育。
    各级监察机关和一切监察人员在执行上述任务时，必须尊重当地党的组织和服从同级党委的领导，经常向党委反映情况，请示报告。同时，应与党的各级监察委员会和人民检察院密切结合进行工作，并认真地依靠各种群众组织，经常检举和揭发机关和工作人员的错误行为。
    为了进一步地发挥监察机关的力量，在工作作法上必须采取有准备、有计划、有重点地，集中地监督与检查的方针。目前，为了有效地制止各种严重的浪费损失现象，保护国家资财，全面地完成国家计划，特别是完成产品的质量指标和成本指标，应在一个部门的几个单位或几个部门的若干单位中，选择一、两个项目，集中一定力量，进行专题检查。检查前，必须作好了解情况，挑选干部，组织力量等准备工作；检查后，必须将发现的问题全面加以分析，提出具体可行的建议，帮助有关部门改进工作。对一些破坏国家计划严重损害国家资财的人员应认真处理。在农村进行检查工作时，必须围绕当地党委和政府各个时期的中心任务，主要是围绕以互助合作为中心的增产运动，和粮食、油料、棉花统购统销，以及生产救灾、征集兵员等各项工作，有重点地选择一、两个县、区，检查干部在执行任务时所发生的强迫命令、违法乱纪、贪污盗窃行为，集中地向党、政领导反映情况，提出意见，请予及时有效的纠正。并分析错误产生的原因，追究责任，根据错误的性质和情节轻重分别对待，对一般的强迫命令，着重进行教育，对违法乱纪和贪污盗窃分子，应予严肃处理。
    为使各级监察机关明确自己的主要任务加强工作重点，应有具体分工：监察部和设在国务院各财经部门的国家监察机关以监督国营企业为主；直辖市、设区的市监察局以监督地方国营企业为主；省监察厅（个别省除外）和专署监察处以监督省、专以下各级行政机关及其工作人员正确地执行国务院、省人民委员会有关以互助合作为中心的农业生产的各项决议、命令及粮食、油料、棉花统购统销政策为主。省监察厅必须加强对与农业生产有关的部门派驻监察机构和专署监察处的领导，同时，还必须领导所属市监察机关和省属某些财经部门派驻监察机构的工作，在必要时，并协助监察部和设在国务院所属部门的国家监察机关对国营企业进行检查。
    为了切实完成以上任务，必须作好以下几项工作：
    1、进一步地学习和正确地推行中长铁路监察工作经验：为了提高监察工作水平，更有效地发挥监察工作作用，一九五五年，在财经部门和国营企业中的监察机关和监察人员，应进一步深入地学习中长铁路监察工作的基本精神，对其具体作法，必须正确推行。凡已经推行的，如铁道、纺织等部门监察机关，应认真总结经验，肯定成绩，纠正缺点，发扬优点，批判不正确的认识，提高工作质量。尚未推行的，可有重点地逐步地推行。
    但在学习和推行中长铁路监察工作经验时，应根据各部门具体情况，防止机械搬用，贪多贪快，追求形式。凡实行事先监督的监察机关，应根据需要，选择主要项目，经上一级监察机关批准后执行。同时，必须指出，学习和推行中长铁路监察工作经验的目的是为了更有效地制止和克服目前国营企业中已经存在的许多严重现象和不断发生的事故，因此，决不应因推行中长铁路监察工作经验而放松对这些现象和重大事故的检查。
    2、适当地调整监察机关的组织和逐步改变领导关系：随着加强对经济建设的监督的中心任务及采取集中地监督和检查的工作方针，监察机关在组织设置上也必须适当调整，即应改变过分分散的情况，加强重点，加强领导骨干。省监察机关应在撤销县和不设区的市监察机关以后，适当地加强省、设区的市和专署监察机关，并选择重点县派驻监察人员。财经部门应收缩那些过分分散的、小型的、不重要的企业监察机关，加强大型的、重要的企业和基本建设单位监察机关，但应防止无准备地盲目地草率调动干部收缩机构的现象。在设置和调整组织时，必须根据国家紧缩编制精简机构的精神及当前干部缺乏的情况，力求精干。
    随着监察工作的发展，必须明确划分国家监察机关和业务部门的内部监察机关的职责，改变领导关系，以便上级国家监察机关统一指挥和集中使用力量。监察部对设在国务院所属部门的国家监察机关采取两种领导关系，即：一、选择一、两个机构比较健全、工作比较有基础的监察局（室）试行垂直领导；二、绝大多数监察局（室）仍保持双重领导。某些部门现有监察机关改为业务部门的内部监察或检查机关，由各该部门领导，监察部只与其保持联系或予以监察业务上的指导。设在各部门的国家监察机关可以对其所属监察机关及企业中派驻的监察人员实行垂直领导。凡中央国营工矿企业不受地方政府领导的，与地方国家监察机关保持联系，必要时，在工作上取得配合。在省、市人民委员会领导的厅、局中，由省、市国家监察机关派驻监察人员，受省、市国家监察机关的领导，并与设在国务院各部门的国家监察机关保持指导关系。
    3、大力培养训练干部：监察工作是一项艰巨的、复杂的政治思想工作，要坚持不懈地和资产阶级思想作斗争，从事监察工作的干部，必须努力地提高马列主义理论和政策思想水平，防止和克服主观片面和形式主义，虚心地学习经济建设的必要知识并熟悉监察工作的业务，积极地学习苏联先进经验。因此，大力培养训练干部就成为提高我国监察工作的决定条件之一，也是监察机关迫不及待的任务。各级监察机关必须迅速地采取有效方法来培养训练干部，监察部准备在今年继续举办短期训练班三期，训练四百五十名左右的干部，并协助设在国务院各部门监察局举办短期训练班，轮训一千五百名左右。各省、市监察机关也应根据需要与可能有计划地训练干部。通过训练，不仅要提高学员的业务水平，而且应提高他们的政策思想水平，并达到了解干部、检查工作的目的。同时还应经常地加强在职干部的理论学习和业务学习，耐心地领导他们钻研业务，研究问题，帮助他们克服工作中的困难，端正思想作风，并可采取召开小型专业会议的方法，具体帮助干部总结经验，交流经验，解决工作中存在的问题。
    4、加强惩戒工作和公民控告申诉处理工作：必须认识，严肃慎重地处理违反国家纪律的案件，认真负责地作好公民控告申诉的处理工作是各级国家监察机关的职责，也是维护国家纪律的一个重要方面。过去几年各级监察机关在这个方面作了很多工作，取得了很大成效，今后，监察部和省、直辖市、设区的市监察机关仍应管理惩戒工作，并对国务院和省、直辖市、设区的市人民委员会任命的工作人员违犯纪律的案件负责审议。在国务院各部门和省、直辖市、设区的市各厅、局的监察机关对自己所检查的案件及不服处分的申诉案件应当提出处理意见，经主管部门或省、市人民委员会或经上级监察机关审议报上级行政机关批准后执行。如果与主管部门和同级人民委员会意见不同，而监察机关认为必须坚持自己的意见时，可报请上级监察机关解决。
    关于公民控告申诉处理工作，目前还有某些监察机关及少数干部不够重视，他们错误地认为处理公民的控告申诉是无关紧要的“应付门市”的工作，依靠公民控告申诉解决不了什么问题，因此，使许多案件拖延积压，长期得不到结果。也有某些财经部门的监察机关，只注意对生产财务方面的监督和检查，而忽视了公民控告申诉处理工作。这种情况必须加以克服。为了提高广大人民群众关心社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的积极性，发挥他们对国家机关和工作人员的监督作用，各级监察机关都必须做好公民控告申诉处理工作，必须积极地直接调查处理若干重大案件，对其中的典型案件，可大张旗鼓的处理以教育干部和广大群众。同时，还应经常督促下级机关及时处理公民控告申诉工作，并有重点地帮助下级机关研究较重大的案件，进行检查处理，帮助他们克服工作中某些困难和障碍。各级监察机关在遇到困难和障碍无法进行检查和处理时，应即逐级上报，上级机关应予以有力的支持。
    为了不断地提高监察工作，各级监察机关，必须对干部加强政治思想领导。认真地研究党和政府每个时期的任务、方针、政策，及时地布置自己的工作，明确地向干部和下级监察机关交代任务、交代政策，具体地指导他们贯彻执行。在每一工作完成后，或在一定时间内应进行深入的检查，总结经验教训，传播成功的经验，批判工作中的缺点和错误，指出改正的办法。领导干部还必须亲自深入重点，培养典型、创造经验，指导全面工作。必须经常注意调查研究，掌握各方面情况，将所发现的问题加以系统的、全面的研究，提出解决问题的意见，报告党政领导，取得指示和支持。我们还必须不断地教育一切监察工作干部，特别是领导干部要时刻警惕自己，不要因工作中获得一点成绩就骄傲自满，也不应因为工作中有了缺点或遇到困难就失掉信心，教育他们要谦虚谨慎，勤勤垦垦地忠于自己的职责，勇敢地坚持真理，坚持原则。为此，各级监察机关就应严格地遵守民主集中制的原则，切实地加强集体领导，发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，听取下级监察机关和干部的意见，了解他们的思想情况和困难，及时予以解决，以提高干部，提高领导，改进工作。
