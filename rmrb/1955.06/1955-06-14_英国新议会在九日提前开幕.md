Xinhua News Agency, London, June 10th. TASS reports: The new British Parliament opened on the 9th. Newspapers and news agencies say that this is the first time the parliament has opened five days earlier than the traditional date. The early opening of Parliament is due to the large-scale strikes in Britain, especially the strikes by locomotive drivers and stokers. As a result of this strike, a state of emergency was declared nationwide, which requires parliamentary approval. In addition, Parliament will discuss issues related to the strike movement.
　　Queen Elizabeth announced the Royal Decree at a joint session of both houses, which, as usual, elaborated the government's program.
　　According to Reuters, Atlee was re-elected as the leader of the parliamentary party at the Labour Party parliamentary group meeting held on the 10th.

    英国新议会在九日提前开幕
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国新议会在九日开幕。据报纸和通讯社说，议会比传统的日期提前五天开幕，这还是第一次。议会提前开幕是由于英国发生了大罢工，特别是机车司机和司炉工人的罢工，因为，由于这次罢工，全国宣布了紧急状态，这是要经过议会批准的。此外，议会还要讨论有关罢工运动的问题。
    伊丽莎白女王在两院联席会议上宣布谕旨，其中照例阐明了政府的纲领。
