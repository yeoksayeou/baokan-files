    Heighten Vigilance, Oppose Complacency
    Luo Ruiqing
    Since the national liberation, our country has achieved great victories on all fronts. In the past two years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation have also achieved significant successes. The progress of all these struggles and the achievements of our work are inseparable from the victories we have achieved in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, and are also inseparable from the victories we have achieved in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Through several years of suppression of counter-revolutionary activities and other struggles, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces in the country have been greatly weakened, the people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated, social order has been further stabilized, the strength of our state organs has been further strengthened, and the people's awareness and organization have been greatly improved. All these are great achievements, which are conducive to safeguarding the security of our country and to safeguarding the socialist construction of our people.
    However, with the stepping up of the US imperialism's preparation for a new war and the development of its activities of aggression and subversion against our country, and with the increasing progress of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, our struggle with counter-revolutionaries has not only not eased or weakened, but has become more intense and more complex. The reason is very clear: as long as there are still remaining counter-revolutionary forces in the country, as long as imperialism still exists abroad, that is to say: as long as there are still classes and class struggles in the world, our enemies will never forget us for a moment, and therefore will never relax their sabotage against us for a moment. And the facts have fully proved that every step forward in our revolutionary cause has aroused the unparalleled hatred and crazy sabotage of enemies at home and abroad. They do not hesitate to adopt all insidious, vicious, and despicable means to try to obstruct our country's socialist construction. In the recent period, the destructive activities of the remaining, hidden counter-revolutionary elements have shown a tendency to resurge. For example, the evil incidents of inciting disturbances, spreading rumors, robbery and arson, sabotaging socialist transformation, sabotaging industrial and agricultural production, and murdering cadres and people have repeatedly occurred in some areas where the work is relatively weak. This shows that all counter-revolutionaries and reactionaries are not reconciled to their own demise. On the contrary, precisely because they have already felt the threat of their imminent demise, they are even more desperate to resist and sabotage. This situation is precisely a reflection of the increasingly fierce class struggle during the transition period.
    Indeed, the various destructive activities carried out by the hidden counter-revolutionary elements against our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation are still quite rampant, and the losses caused by the enemy's sabotage to the country and the people are extremely alarming. However, the seriousness of the problem lies not only in the fact that we still have enemies and enemy sabotage activities in front of us, but especially in the fact that many people among us, including some Communist Party members and cadres, are developing an extremely dangerous mood of peace and complacency. This mood of peace and complacency has blinded these people's political vigilance, making them turn a blind eye to the current acute class struggle and the rampant destructive activities carried out by the enemy. Many people are satisfied with the victories we have achieved in the past struggles, believing that after various social reforms and the suppression of counter-revolutionary movements, there are no more counter-revolutionaries in the country, or even if there are, they are few in number and not worth worrying about. Therefore, they cannot see the enemy, and even if they see them, they don't think they are anything great. They say: "A few small fish cannot make big waves." "Can writing a few reactionary slogans bring Chiang Kai-shek back?" "Since the regime is in our hands, it doesn't matter if a few counter-revolutionaries exist for a while." "Since the bourgeoisie does not dare to openly rebel or engage in armed struggle with us, even if there are a few hidden counter-revolutionaries, we can rest easy." Some people are even bewitched by the current so-called "peaceful scene" and advocate that we should also "release the horses on Nanshan Mountain and store the knives and guns in the warehouse." In essence, this is advocating that we should not continue to strengthen our state power, strengthen our national defense, and strengthen our people's democratic dictatorship. Obviously, this kind of blind optimism and underestimation of the enemy, intoxicated with past victories, is extremely harmful and dangerous. The reason why people are like this is because they have forgotten the law of class struggle, which is: the more advanced and victorious the revolutionary cause is, the more ruthless and intensified the revenge and sabotage of the revolutionary enemy will inevitably be.
    Another prominent manifestation of the thought of peace and complacency is that in many comrades and even some responsible cadres, the tendency to bury themselves in business and not ask about politics is extremely serious. They say: "Since business is so important, and we are already too busy with business, where is there time to care about politics?" They think that the whole country is engaged in production and construction, and that production and construction are advancing by leaps and bounds, and the broad masses of people are rejoicing and cheering. Where is there any class struggle? Or they verbally admit that there is still class struggle, and also admit that class struggle is becoming increasingly acute, but they adopt a careless attitude towards the issue of counter-revolutionaries. As a result, they gradually lose their political sense of smell, and often have no awareness of the counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the interior, and still think they can rest easy even sleeping with a tiger. This careless and vulgar attitude among some leading personnel makes the political work of the units they lead weak, the atmosphere of principles thin, discipline lax, and systems loose, creating convenient conditions for counter-revolutionary elements to infiltrate the interior and carry out sabotage activities. The reason why people are like this is because they have forgotten this truth, which is: to build a socialist society is to completely eliminate exploitation and eliminate classes, and the complete elimination of exploitation and elimination of classes must be an extremely cruel and extremely fierce life-and-death class struggle. Socialist construction versus sabotaging socialist construction, socialist transformation versus sabotaging socialist transformation, is precisely the main content of the current struggle between the enemy and us.
    One of the characteristics of the current class struggle is that the enemy's destructive activities are more cunning and more concealed. The insufficient understanding and vigilance of many people towards this characteristic is another more common manifestation of the mood of peace and complacency. Many of our cadres are easily deceived by the counter-revolutionary elements' sweet words and hypocritical appearances, and easily blinded by their various disguises and cloaks. For example, in the various accidents that occur in industrial and mining enterprises, some people often regard them all as natural accidents and responsibility accidents. Because they lack vigilance, they are rarely able to distinguish and recognize the political sabotage activities carried out by counter-revolutionary elements, special agents and spies who use their powers, use their technology, and use so-called 'natural accidents' or 'responsibility accidents' as excuses. For example, regarding certain disturbances that occur in rural areas, some comrades, due to lack of vigilance, often only see the superficial phenomena of certain shortcomings in our work and certain dissatisfactions of a small number of peasants, and cannot see or ignore the essence of the remaining counter-revolutionary elements or class enemies hiding in the masses and taking the opportunity to incite. Especially for those counter-revolutionary elements or reactionaries who have sneaked into or mixed into our organizations, put on the uniforms of state personnel, and even tricked themselves into obtaining the titles of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, cloaked in Marxism-Leninism, and carried out destructive activities with the methods of double-dealers, many of our comrades lack the ability to identify and recognize them. The fact that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was able to infiltrate the revolutionary camp and hide for more than 20 years, deceiving many people, and that some of the core members of the Hu Feng clique even infiltrated the Communist Party and were not discovered for a long time, is a very serious lesson. The reason why people lack the ability to identify disguised counter-revolutionary elements is because they have simplified the complex class struggle. Precisely because class struggle is becoming increasingly acute and complex, the enemy knows even more that in order to both preserve themselves and strike at our vital points, they have to disguise themselves more cleverly and try to hide deep inside us. Otherwise, the enemy will not be able to carry out sabotage, or even survive. And if we are complacent and underestimate the enemy, have a dull sense of smell, are not vigilant, are not good at seeing through the enemy's cloak, are not good at identifying counter-revolutionary elements, and exposing all their conspiracies, we will inevitably be fooled by counter-revolutionary elements and cause damage to the revolutionary cause.
    From this it can be seen that the complacent mood towards hidden counter-revolutionary elements is extremely wrong and extremely dangerous. In a period when international and domestic class struggles are tending to become tense and complex, any complacency, political carelessness, or tolerance and appeasement towards the enemy's destructive activities will only condone or even encourage the destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements. We should strictly and systematically criticize all kinds of complacency and earnestly overcome them. Our task is to greatly enhance our political consciousness and revolutionary vigilance, effectively strengthen our revolutionary struggle, resolutely suppress all destructive activities of counter-revolutionary elements, thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the revolutionary organizations, further consolidate our revolutionary dictatorship, and safeguard the smooth completion of socialist construction and socialist transformation, in order to build our country into a great socialist country.
    How do we raise political consciousness and revolutionary vigilance and practically strengthen the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionary elements?
    First, we must greatly strengthen the propaganda and education work of preventing spies and anti-special agents. The movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries has already dealt a heavy blow to the exposed counter-revolutionary elements. Therefore, many of the current counter-revolutionary elements are acting with the methods of double-dealers like the Hu Feng clique. Moreover, the further we go, the more concealed the enemy will become, and the more clever their methods of disguise and activities will become. Therefore, we must never underestimate the enemy, and we must arm ourselves with the reality of class struggle and the lessons of history. We should do this propaganda and education work very fully and very regularly. The Soviet Union has been established for thirty-eight years, and they have always paid attention to, and still pay great attention to, the propaganda and education work of raising the vigilance of the whole party and the whole people. This fact and experience is of great significance to us. Some people think that since the enemy is becoming more and more concealed and it is not easy for ordinary people to identify them, we only need to strengthen the work of the state public security organs and do not need to do any propaganda and education work. This view is harmful. Precisely because the enemy is becoming more and more concealed, it is even more necessary to raise the vigilance of the broad masses, and it is even more necessary to have millions of eyes to pay attention to and monitor the enemy. Without the revolutionary vigilance of all communists, democratic parties and the broad masses, it is difficult to discover and defeat hidden counter-revolutionary elements with only the efforts of the state public security organs. Some people say that since counter-revolutionary elements are disguising themselves more cleverly, can we identify them? We can answer with certainty that they can be identified. Because any hidden and cunning enemy always has loopholes, they always have to carry out activities, so they will always be exposed. The exposure of the Hu Feng clique is an evidence. When the people's awareness and vigilance are raised, combined with the special work of the state organs, any hidden enemy will always be exposed. Then, will strengthening the propaganda and education work of preventing spies and anti-special agents alert the enemy and make it possible for them to find lessons that are conducive to counter-revolutionary activities from the materials that have been revealed? Of course, this is possible. However, the result of our propaganda and education work is first and foremost to raise the awareness and vigilance of the broad masses of the people, to increase the experience of fighting against hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and the power exerted by the awakened people is difficult for any counter-revolutionary element to resist.
    Second, we must strictly enforce the systems of revolutionary organizations and state organs, especially the personnel system, and strictly prevent counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements from sneaking into or mixing into the interior of the revolutionary ranks. All hidden counter-revolutionary elements believe that the best way to hide themselves for a long time and not "run into some unexpected blows" is to sneak into our “liver”. Because our organs, troops, enterprises or groups are not vigilant enough, their sense of smell is not sensitive enough, their eyes are not bright enough, and especially because the system is not strict enough and there are many gaps, a group of counter-revolutionary elements have sneaked into our interior in various ways. Some have even seized our fairly important or confidential positions. Although they are few in number, the situation is very serious and very dangerous. While thoroughly crushing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we must also resolutely and thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements similar to the Hu Feng clique hidden in our ranks, and draw lessons from them, strictly enforce the system of personnel use and personnel review, and effectively prevent counter-revolutionary elements from sneaking in. Here we encounter a strange point of view, that is, as long as work needs or production needs, as long as there are skills and culture, even counter-revolutionary elements should be used. And in fact, some counter-revolutionary elements have sneaked into some of our organs, factories, and schools under this point of view and practice. This point of view is a suicidal practice of "drinking poison to quench thirst," and is a practice that completely loses a sense of responsibility to the country and the people. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is a fact, and it is still continuing in some units, and sometimes this phenomenon is simply astonishingly intolerable. There is no doubt that this phenomenon is only welcomed by the counter-revolutionaries, and is extremely harmful to the country and the people, so it should be resolutely eliminated.
    Third, we must advocate loyalty and honesty in the revolutionary ranks and oppose telling lies in politics. This is an important thing to block the gaps in counter-revolutionary activities and thus restrict and combat counter-revolutionary activities. The basic characteristics and methods of all disguised counter-revolutionary elements and double-dealers are to do everything possible to deceive, and to tell lies to the country, to the people, and to the revolutionary organizations, but to tell the truth only to their counter-revolutionary masters and to the people inside the counter-revolutionary cliques. The Hu Feng clique is a typical example of telling lies. Hu Feng said "following the revolution," but in fact he was opposing the revolution; Hu Feng said "supporting the Communist Party," but in fact he was undermining the Communist Party; Hu Feng said "supporting Marxism," but in fact he was opposing Marxism; the "greatest sincerity" of the Hu Feng elements was the greatest hypocrisy, and the so-called "more detailed and honest than the last time" was more dishonest than the last time. Therefore, in order for us to be able to easily see through the disguised and double-dealing counter-revolutionary elements, we must further raise our vigilance and raise our sense of smell to prevent being deceived. However, this alone is not enough. If disguised counter-revolutionary elements want to tell lies, are all those who tell lies in politics counter-revolutionary elements? We cannot say that now. Because the ideological toxins of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes left over from the old society have not been eliminated, and they still have an impact on many people. Therefore, some people still have concealment in politics for their own selfish purposes or other purposes, and have told lies on political issues to the revolutionary organizations. What is the harm of this situation? Its harm lies in actually helping the counter-revolutionary elements to confuse the people's vision, making it more difficult for the people to quickly and accurately see through the deception of the counter-revolutionaries, thereby making it difficult to discover and combat the counter-revolutionary elements in a timely manner. At the same time, people who tell lies in politics are easily fooled by counter-revolutionary elements, and even have their handles seized by counter-revolutionary elements and dragged into the fire pit. This has long been a common method used by counter-revolutionary elements, and many people have long known this. In fact, only counter-revolutionary elements need to use lies to cover up their political behavior. Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, revolutionaries, and all honest citizens have no need to cover up their political behavior at all, so there is no need to tell lies at all. Moreover, telling lies in politics is a manifestation of disloyalty and dishonesty to the Party, to the people, and to the country, and is incompatible with the titles of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and revolutionaries. As a state employee, if you deceive your own country on political issues, it is a violation of state discipline in a light case, and even a crime in a serious case. Therefore, we should advocate political loyalty and honesty, and oppose telling lies. If you have told lies about your political behavior, you should consciously correct it. Otherwise, you cannot expect to gain the trust of the Party and the country. Moreover, telling lies is like using paper to wrap fire, which will eventually be unable to be wrapped and will be exposed. Of course, the person will be responsible for political deception once it is revealed. If everyone does not tell lies, then the counter-revolutionary elements who rely on telling lies to deceive the revolutionary organizations and deceive the people will be isolated, and their activities and survival will become more difficult. This will definitely greatly benefit our struggle against counter-revolutionary elements.
    Finally, we must strictly keep the secrets of the Party and the state, and resolutely oppose any carelessness, destruction of systems, violation of discipline, "small broadcasts," boasting, "busybody," casually discussing or citing state confidential materials in private correspondence and published articles, and other bad behaviors. Some of these behaviors are no longer just manifestations of liberalism, but constitute a crime against the state and the people. All hidden counter-revolutionary elements are using every weakness and every gap in this area to steal the secrets of our Party and the state, and have already stolen a lot of secrets. We must take all effective measures to maintain the secrets of the Party and the state, otherwise we will inevitably suffer unexpected and serious losses inflicted on us by counter-revolutionary elements. It should be particularly pointed out that liberalism in the revolutionary ranks is the best helper for counter-revolutionary elements to steal Party and state secrets. We must strictly criticize and overcome liberalism, and not give counter-revolutionary elements a market for activities. This is what every one of our comrades should pay attention to.
    As mentioned earlier, the purpose of our struggle is nothing else, but precisely to strengthen and complete our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and to build our motherland into a great and advanced socialist industrial country with greater assurance. The more we love our motherland's today and tomorrow, the more we must raise our vigilance, oppose complacency, and strengthen our struggle against counter-revolutionary elements, so that the great construction cause of our motherland will not be harmed by counter-revolutionary elements.

    提高警惕，反对麻痹
    罗瑞卿
    全国解放以后，我们的国家在各个战线上都取得了伟大胜利。两年以来，我们的国家在中国共产党的领导下所进行的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，又获得重大的成就。所有这些斗争的进展和工作的成就，都是同我们对国内外敌人进行斗争所取得的胜利分不开的，也是同镇压反革命所取得的胜利分不开的。经过几年来对反革命活动的镇压和其他方面的斗争，国内的残余反革命势力是被大大削弱了，人民民主专政是更加巩固了，社会秩序是更加安定了，我们的国家机关的力量是更加加强了，人民的觉悟性和组织性是大大提高了。所有这些都是伟大的成绩，都是有利于保卫我们的国家的安全，有利于保卫我国人民的社会主义的建设事业的。
    但是，随着美帝国主义对新战争的准备的加紧和对我国的侵略颠覆活动的发展，随着我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的日益进展，我们同反革命分子之间的斗争，不仅没有缓和没有减弱，而是更加紧张更加复杂了。道理十分明显，只要国内还存在着反革命残余势力，只要国外还存在着帝国主义，也就是说：只要世界上还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，我们的敌人是一刻也不会忘记我们，因而就一刻也不会放松对于我们的破坏的。而且事实已充分证明，我们革命事业的每一步前进，都引起了国内外敌人的无比仇视和疯狂破坏，他们不惜采取一切阴险、恶毒的卑鄙手段，力图阻挠我国的社会主义建设。在最近一个时期以来，残余的、暗藏下来的反革命分子的破坏活动，又有重新抬头的趋势。例如：煽动骚乱，散布谣言，抢劫放火，破坏社会主义改造，破坏工农业生产，杀害干部和人民的罪恶事件，曾在若干工作较为薄弱的地方一再发生。这表明了一切反革命分子和反动分子并不甘心于自己的灭亡，相反的，正是由于他们已经感到了就要灭亡的威胁，因而也就更加要拚命地实行抵抗和破坏。这种情况，正是过渡时期阶级斗争日益剧烈的反映。
    的确，暗藏下来的反革命分子针对我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业所进行的各种破坏活动，还是相当猖獗的，敌人的破坏给国家和人民所造成的损失是极其惊人的。但是，问题的严重性不仅仅在于我们面前还存在敌人和敌人的破坏活动，特别还在于我们中间有不少人其中包括一部分共产党员和干部，正在滋长着一种极端危险的太平麻痹情绪。这种太平麻痹情绪，蒙蔽了这些人的政治警惕性，使他们对于目前尖锐的阶级斗争，对于敌人所进行的猖獗的破坏活动熟视无睹。不少的人满足于我们过去斗争中所取得的胜利，认为经过各项社会改革和镇压反革命运动，国内已经没有什么反革命分子了，即使还有也为数无几，不足为患了，因而眼睛看不到敌人，即使看到了，也觉得没有什么了不起。他们说：“几条小鱼翻不起大浪。”“写几条反动标语还能把蒋介石写回来？”“既然政权在我们手里，让几个反革命分子存在一时，是不要紧的。”“既然资产阶级不敢公开造反，不敢同我们进行武装斗争，即使有几个暗藏的反革命分子，我们也可以高枕无忧。”甚至有的人因为迷惑于当前的所谓“太平景象”，主张我们也应该“马放南山，刀枪入库”。这在实质上就是主张我们不应该继续加强我们的国家政权，加强我们的国防，加强我们的人民民主专政。很显然，这种陶醉于过去取得的胜利、盲目乐观的轻敌麻痹情绪是极端有害的、危险的。人们之所以如此，是由于忘记了阶级斗争的这样一条规律，这条规律就是：革命的事业愈前进，愈胜利，而革命的敌人的报复破坏就必然会愈凶狠，愈加剧。
    太平麻痹思想的另一个突出表现，是在不少同志乃至某些负责干部中埋头业务不问政治的倾向极为严重。他们说：“既然业务那末重要，业务已经忙不过来，哪还有时间关心政治呢？”他们以为全国都在生产建设，而且生产建设突飞猛进，广大人民欢欣鼓舞，哪里还有什么阶级斗争？或者口头上承认还有阶级斗争，并且也承认阶级斗争日益尖锐，但在对待反革命分子问题上，却采取了一种漫不经心的态度，因而使自己逐渐丧失了政治嗅觉，往往对混入内部的反革命分子毫无察觉，同老虎睡在一起还自以为高枕无忧。一部分领导人员中这种漫不经心的庸俗态度，就使他们所领导的单位政治工作薄弱，原则空气稀薄，纪律废弛，制度松懈，给反革命分子混入内部进行破坏活动造成了便利条件。人们之所以如此，是由于他们忘记了这样一条真理，这条真理就是：建设社会主义社会就是要彻底消灭剥削和消灭阶级，而彻底消灭剥削和消灭阶级必然是一场极残酷、极剧烈的你死我活的阶级斗争。社会主义建设同破坏社会主义建设，社会主义改造同破坏社会主义改造，正是当前敌我斗争的主要内容。
    目前阶级斗争的特点之一是敌人的破坏活动的更加狡猾和更加隐蔽。许多人对于这一特点认识不足和警惕不够，乃是太平麻痹情绪的又一个较为普遍的表现。我们的不少干部容易被反革命分子的花言巧语和伪善面貌所欺骗，容易被他们的各种伪装和外衣所蒙蔽。例如：在工矿企业中所发生的各种事故，有人往往一律把它们看成是自然事故和责任事故，对于反革命分子、特务间谍分子利用职权，利用技术，借口所谓‘自然事故’或‘责任事故’所进行的政治破坏活动，因为缺乏警惕性，就很少能够辨别和识破。又如对于农村中所发生的某些骚乱，一些同志由于缺乏警惕性，也往往只看到我们工作中的某些缺点和少数农民群众的某些不满的表面现象，而看不到或忽略了残余反革命分子或阶级敌对分子隐藏在群众中乘机进行煽惑的实质。尤其是对于那些钻入或混入我们组织内部，穿上国家工作人员的制服，甚至骗取得共产党员、青年团员的称号，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，以两面派的手法进行破坏活动的反革命分子或反动分子，我们的不少同志更缺乏鉴别识破的能力。胡风反革命集团能够混入革命阵营，隐藏二十多年，使许多人受欺骗，胡风集团的某些骨干分子竟混入共产党内，长期未被发觉，这个事件就是很严重的教训。人们之所以缺乏识别伪装的反革命分子的能力，是由于他们把复杂的阶级斗争看得简单化了的缘故。正是由于阶级斗争的日益尖锐和复杂，敌人也就愈加知道，为了既能保存他们自己，又能打中我们的要害，他们就不得不把自己伪装得更加巧妙，并力求深入我们的内部躲藏起来。否则敌人就将无法进行破坏，甚至无法生存下去。而我们如果麻痹轻敌，嗅觉不灵，警惕不高，不善于透过敌人的外衣，不善于辨别反革命分子，并揭露他们的一切阴谋，我们就必然要上反革命分子的当，使革命事业遭受损害。
    由此可见，对待暗藏的反革命分子的麻痹情绪是极端错误和极端危险的。在国际国内阶级斗争正趋于紧张化、复杂化的时期内，任何麻痹轻敌，政治上的漫不经心，或者对敌人的破坏活动采取容忍姑息的态度，都只能纵容甚至助长反革命分子的破坏活动。我们应该严格地系统地批判各种麻痹情绪，并认真加以克服。我们的任务是要大大地提高我们的政治觉悟和革命警惕性，有效地加强我们的革命斗争，坚决地将一切反革命分子的破坏活动镇压下去，彻底肃清一切暗藏在革命组织内部的反革命分子，更加巩固我们的革命专政，保卫社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利完成，以达到把我们的国家建设成为伟大的社会主义国家的目的。
    我们怎样来提高政治觉悟和革命警惕，实际加强镇压反革命分子的斗争呢？
    首先，要大大加强防奸反特的宣传教育工作。镇压反革命运动，已经使公开的暴露的反革命分子受到了沉重的打击，因而现在的反革命分子很多是用像胡风集团这样的两面派的手法进行活动的，而且愈往后，敌人就会愈加隐蔽，伪装和活动的方式也会愈加巧妙。因此，我们决不要轻视敌人，必须要用阶级斗争的现实和历史的教训来武装我们自己。这项宣传教育工作我们应该做得很充分很经常。苏联建国已经三十八年了，他们一贯注意，并且到现在还十分注意提高全党和全体人民警惕性的宣传教育工作，这个事实和经验对我们是有重要意义的。有人以为既然敌人愈加隐蔽，一般人不易识别，因此只要加强国家公安机关的工作，不必做什么宣传教育工作了，这种看法是有害的。正是因为敌人愈加隐蔽，就愈加需要提高广大群众的警惕性，就愈加需要有千百万双眼睛来注意和监视敌人。没有一切共产党人、民主党派和广大群众的革命警觉，仅有国家公安机关的努力，要发现和战胜隐蔽的反革命分子是很困难的。有人说，既然愈往后反革命分子伪装得愈巧妙，那末我们能否识别他们呢？我们肯定地回答，是可以识别的。因为任何隐蔽的狡猾的敌人，他们总是有漏洞的，他们总是要进行活动的，因此，他们总是要暴露的。胡风集团的被揭露就是一个证据。人民的觉悟和警惕性提高了，同国家机关的专门工作结合起来，任何暗藏的敌人总是要被揭露出来的。那么，加强防奸反特的宣传教育工作，是否会警觉敌人，使他们有可能从已经揭发的材料中，找到有利于反革命活动的教训呢？当然，这是可能的。但是我们的宣传教育工作的结果首先是使广大人民的觉悟和警惕性提高了，同暗藏反革命分子斗争的经验增加了，觉悟了的人民发挥出来的力量，是任何反革命分子也难于抵抗的。
    其次，要严格革命组织和国家机关的制度，特别是用人制度，严防反革命分子和其他坏分子钻入或混入到革命队伍的内部来。一切暗藏的反革命分子，他们认为要长期地隐藏自己，不要“碰上一些意想不到的打击”，最好的办法就是钻入到我们的
  “肝脏里”来。由于我们的机关、部队、企业或团体的警惕不高、嗅觉不灵、眼睛不亮，特别是制度不严、空隙甚多，已经有一批反革命分子以各种方式钻到我们内部来了，有的甚至窃据了我们相当重要的或机要的岗位，虽然他们为数甚少，但情况是十分严重十分危险的。我们应该在彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团的同时，也要把类似胡风集团的一切暗藏在我们队伍中的反革命分子，坚决地彻底地清除出去，并从中得出教训，严格用人和人事审查的制度，切实防止反革命分子钻进来。在这里我们碰到一种奇怪的观点，那就是认为只要工作需要或生产需要，只要有技术、有文化，就是反革命分子也要用。而且事实上，有些反革命分子已经在这种观点和做法下钻进了我们的某些机关、工厂、学校。这种观点就是一种“饮鸩止渴”的自杀做法，是完全丧失了对国家和人民的责任心的做法。可惜，这种现象竟是事实，并且到现在在一些单位中仍在继续发生，有时这种现象，简直达到惊人的不能容忍的程度。毫无疑义，这种现象只是为反革命所欢迎，而对国家和人民是极端有害的，因此是应该坚决消除的。
    再次，要在革命队伍中提倡忠诚老实，反对在政治上说假话。这是堵塞反革命活动的空隙，从而限制和打击反革命活动的有重要意义的一件事。一切伪装的反革命分子、两面派分子，他们的基本特点和手法，就是用尽心思进行欺骗，对国家对人民对革命组织都是说假话，只是对他们的反革命主子和反革命集团内部的人才说真话。胡风集团，就是说假话的一个典型。胡风说“追随革命”，实际上是反对革命；胡风说“拥护共产党”，实际上是破坏共产党；胡风说“拥护马克思主义”，实际上是反对马克思主义；胡风分子们说的“最大诚恳”，就是最大的虚伪，所谓“一次比一次详尽而老实”，就是一次比一次不老实。因此，为了使我们能够容易识破伪装的、两面派的反革命分子，我们就要更加提高警惕，提高嗅觉，防止受骗。但是，仅仅这样还不够。伪装的反革命分子要说假话，是否在政治上说假话的都是反革命分子呢？现在还不能这样说。因为旧社会遗留下来的资产阶级和其他剥削阶级的思想毒素，还没有肃清，还在不少人的身上有影响，因而，还有一些人为了自私自利或其他的目的，在政治上有隐瞒，向革命组织在政治问题上说了假话。这种情形有什么害处呢？它的害处就在于在实际上帮助反革命分子搅乱了人民的视线，使人民比较难于迅速地准确地识破反革命的欺骗，从而难于及时地发现和打击反革命分子。同时，在政治上说假话的人，很容易上反革命分子的当，以至被反革命分子抓住把柄，拖入火坑。这早已是反革命分子惯用的手法，也是许多人早已知道的。事实上，只有反革命分子才需要用假话来掩盖自己的政治行为，共产党员、青年团员、革命者和一切正直的公民，是根本没有必要掩盖自己的政治行为的，因此是根本不需要说假话的。而且政治上说假话，是对党、对人民、对国家的不忠诚、不老实的表现，是同共产党员、青年团员、革命者的称号不相容的。作为一个国家工作人员，如果对自己的国家在政治问题上实行欺骗，轻则是一种违反国家纪律的行为，重则甚至是一种犯法的行为。因此，我们应该提倡政治上忠诚老实、反对说假话。如果对自己的政治行为说了假话，应该自觉地加以修正。否则，是不能指望得到党和国家的信任的。而且说假话就如同用纸去包火，终究是包不住的，是要被戳穿的。政治上的欺骗行为，一旦被揭露了，当然本人是要负责的。大家都不说假话，那么，靠说假话来欺骗革命组织、欺骗人民的反革命分子，就要孤立起来，他们的活动和生存就会发生更大的困难。这样就一定会大大有利于我们同反革命分子的斗争。
    最后，要严格保守党和国家的机密，坚决反对任何疏忽大意，破坏制度，违反纪律，“小广播”，瞎吹牛，“包打听”，随便在私人通信中、在发表的文章中谈论或援引国家的机密材料等等恶劣的行为。这些行为有些已经不止是自由主义的表现，而且构成了对国家对人民的犯罪。一切暗藏的反革命分子，正在利用我们在这方面的每一个弱点，每一个空隙，窃取我们党和国家的机密，而且已经窃取了不少的机密。我们一定要采取一切有效措施来保持住党和国家的机密，否则我们就难免要遭到反革命分子所加给我们的意外的严重损失。特别应该指出，革命队伍中的自由主义，是反革命分子窃取党和国家机密的最好的帮手，我们要严格批评和克服自由主义，不给反革命分子以活动的市场。这是我们每一个同志应该注意的。
    前面已经说过，我们斗争的目的，不是为了别的，而正是为了加强和完成我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业，为了更有保证地把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的先进的社会主义工业国。我们愈是热爱我们祖国的今天和明天，我们就愈要提高警惕，反对麻痹，加强我们同反革命分子的斗争，使我们祖国的伟大建设事业不致受到反革命分子的危害。
