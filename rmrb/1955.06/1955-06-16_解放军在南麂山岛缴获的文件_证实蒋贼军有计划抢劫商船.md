Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch – Among the items seized by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army from the Nanji Islands, a “Meeting Minutes” from the Chiang Kai-shek army's "Independent 35th Column Headquarters" discussing methods for distributing loot from robbing merchant ships was found. The document stipulates that after Chiang Kai-shek's troops intercept and seize property from passing merchant ships, 20% of the loot would be given to the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers participating in the robbery as a "bonus," another 20% would be handed over to the so-called "departure management unit" as "revolving funds," and the Chiang Kai-shek officer in charge of commanding the robbery would receive 5% as a so-called "special bonus." The remaining 55% of the loot would be allocated to the "Economic Committee" in the Chiang Kai-shek army to serve as military expenses. The document also stipulates that the fuel, weapons, ammunition, and other supplies consumed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops in intercepting passing merchant ships would be "distributed by the headquarters" of the Chiang Kai-shek army.

This document fully proves that the piratical crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in looting passing merchant ships were conducted with command and planning.

    解放军在南麂山岛缴获的文件
    证实蒋贼军有计划抢劫商船
    新华社十五日讯　中国人民解放军自南麂山岛缴获的物件中，清查出一份蒋贼军“独立第三十五纵队司令部”讨论抢劫海上往来商船分赃办法的
  “会议记录”。这份文件中规定：蒋贼军各部队截获过往商船财物后，其中百分之二十的赃物归参加抢劫的蒋贼军官兵作为“奖金”，另外百分之二十上缴给所谓“出发主管单位”作为“周转金”，担任指挥抢劫的蒋贼军官，可以分到百分之五的所谓
  “特别奖金”；其余的百分之五十五的赃物拨归蒋贼军中的“经济委员会”充当军费。这份文件中还规定：蒋贼军各部队拦截过往商船所耗用的燃料、武器、弹药等，都由蒋贼军“总部配发”。
    这份文件完全证明了蒋贼军劫掠过往商船的海盗罪行是有指挥、有计划地进行的。
