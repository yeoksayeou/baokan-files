    Heighten Vigilance, Dig Out All Hidden Enemies
    Mao Dun
      The "People's Daily" published the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," exposing the political background of the Hu Feng group. This part of the material dug up the roots of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique! This part of the material revealed that Hu Feng himself was a loyal running dog of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang from the beginning; the resumes of Hu Feng himself and the core members of his group were extremely ugly and could not be seen; the anti-Party and anti-people crimes committed by Hu Feng and his group for a long time were cunning, insidious and vicious, a complete portrayal of the features and methods of special agents trained by the US-Chiang alliance.
    After the publication of the first and second batches of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, the vast majority of people were angry and demanded investigation into the political background of the Hu Feng group; however, some people still thought that the Hu Feng group was just a small group of ambitious elements in the cultural circles, and they did not necessarily have any reactionary political background. But as the "People's Daily" "Editor's Note" on June 10 correctly pointed out: "Those who say such things either sympathize with them wholeheartedly out of class instinct; or they have a poor political sense of smell and think things too naively; and some are hidden reactionaries, or people within the Hu Feng group, such as Lu Ying in Beijing." This passage from the "People's Daily" "Editor's Note" raised our vigilance. Since the publication of the first and second batches of materials, one of the "tactics" of the Hu Feng group members has been to use various methods to describe the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group problem as a purely ideological problem rather than a political problem. If we do not view the Hu Feng group problem from the perspective of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution at this time, then we will be fooled by the Hu Feng group once again, or even "sympathize with them wholeheartedly out of class instinct."
    On the other hand, some people think this way: since the Hu Feng group problem is a political problem, then it is a matter for the People's Procuratorate, and the criticism of the Hu Feng group's reactionary literary and artistic thought can come to an end. Such thinking is also one-sided. From the point of view of carrying out historical materialism and dialectical materialism ideological education to the vast cultural circles, the work of criticizing the Hu Feng group's reactionary literary and artistic thought should continue to be meticulous and in-depth. However, if anyone at this time uses ideological criticism to divert the firepower of our political struggle, then, if it is not with ulterior motives, it is either politically numb, or it is class instinct at work.
      The last paragraph of the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" is very correct in pointing out: "Our people must study, must improve class vigilance, and political sense of smell must be more sensitive. If the Hu Feng group can give us anything positive, it is to greatly improve our political consciousness and political sensitivity through this thrilling struggle, resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries, and greatly consolidate our revolutionary dictatorship, so as to carry the revolution through to the end and achieve the goal of building a great socialist country."
    Our literary and art circles' class vigilance is not high, and political sense of smell is not sensitive. Before the Party newspaper exposed the Hu Feng group, we could not have imagined that it was so insidious and vicious. I knew Hu Feng very early on. When Hu Feng first returned from Japan and mixed into the League of Left-Wing Writers, I had many dealings with him. But at that time, I only felt that this person was arrogant, sharp, self-important, and always wanted to dominate; and even when Comrade Feng Xuefeng told me about Hu Feng's crimes of sowing discord at Lu Xun's place during the period when Mr. Lu Xun was ill before his death, I only felt that this person's character was very bad, and in order to achieve personal ambitions, he could disregard the overall situation, but I had not suspected that he had other origins; until the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, the Hu Feng group clearly formed and became more and more rampant, but at that time I still thought that this was just a small group in literature and art, some self-important, arrogant careerists.
    Now, with the ironclad facts before our eyes, we can no longer be paralyzed. We must investigate the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to the end, and get to the bottom of it. This is not only a matter for the literary and art circles, but a complex and acute class struggle. The class enemies at home and abroad are exhausting all means to obstruct and sabotage our socialist construction cause, and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is one of them; we must learn from the Hu Feng incident, improve our political consciousness and political sensitivity, prevent the enemy from taking advantage of loopholes, and dig out all hidden enemies.

    提高警惕，挖尽一切潜藏的敌人
    茅盾
      “人民日报”发表的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”，揭露了胡风集团的政治背景。这一部分材料，挖了胡风反革命集团的根！这一部分材料，揭露了胡风其人自始就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗；胡风本人和他的集团内的骨干分子的履历，都是丑恶已极，见不得人的；胡风和他的集团的分子长时期以来所进行的反党、反人民的罪恶勾当，都是狡诈、阴险而且狠毒的，十足是美蒋训练出来的特务的嘴脸和手法。
    胡风反革命集团的第一、二批材料公布以后，极大多数人是愤怒，是要求追究胡风集团的政治背景；但是也还有一些人以为胡风集团不过是文化界少数野心分子的一个小集团，他们不一定有什么反动政治背景。但正如六月十日“人民日报”“编者按”所正确地指出：“说这样话的人们，或者是因为在阶级本能上衷心地同情他们；或者是因为政治上嗅觉不灵，把事情想得太天真了；还有一部分则是暗藏的反动分子，或者就是胡风集团里面的人，例如北京的吕荧。”“人民日报”“编者按”的这段话，提高了我们的警惕性。自从第一、二批材料公布后，胡风集团分子的“策略”之一，就是要用各种各样的方法把胡风反革命集团问题说成只是一个思想问题而不是政治问题。我们在此时如果不从革命同反革命的斗争上来看胡风集团问题，那就是又一次上了胡风集团的当，或者竟是“在阶级本能上衷心地同情他们”。
    另一方面，也有人这样想：胡风集团问题既然是个政治问题，那就是人民检察院的事了，而对于胡风集团的反动的文艺思想的批判可以告一结束。这样的想法也是片面的。从对广大文化界进行历史唯物论和辩证唯物论的思想教育这点看来，批判胡风集团反动的文艺思想的工作还应当继续细致地深入下去。不过，谁要是在这时候，用思想批判来转移我们的政治斗争的火力，那末，如果不是别有用心，便是政治上太麻木，或者是阶级本能在作怪了。
      “关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”的最后一段按语非常正确地指出来：“我们的人必须学习，必须提高阶级警觉性，政治嗅觉必须放灵些。如果说胡风集团能给我们一些什么积极的东西，那就是借着这一次惊心动魄的斗争，大大地提高我们的政治觉悟和政治敏感，坚决地将一切反革命分子镇压下去，而使我们的革命专政大大地巩固起来，以便将革命进行到底，达到建成伟大的社会主义国家的目的。”
    我们文艺界的阶级警觉性就是不高的，政治嗅觉就是不灵的。对于胡风集团，在党报揭露以前，我们想不到它是这样的阴险狠毒。我很早就认识胡风，在胡风刚从日本回来，混进左翼作家联盟的时候，就和他打过多次交道，可是在那时，我仅只觉得这个人骄傲尖刻，自命不凡，处处想称霸；而直到鲁迅先生逝世前卧病的一段时间内，冯雪峰同志把胡风在鲁迅先生那里所进行的挑拨离间的罪恶告诉我的时候，我亦仅只觉得这个人品质十分恶劣，为了达到个人野心，可以不顾大局，而还没有怀疑到他别有来历；到抗战后期，胡风集团明显形成，而且愈益猖獗，可是那时我也还以为这只是文艺上的小集团，是一些自命不凡，狂妄的野心家。
    现在，铁一般的事实摆在眼前，我们不能再麻痹了。我们必须对胡风反革命集团的罪行追究到底，弄个水落石出。这不仅是文艺界的事，这是复杂尖锐的阶级斗争。国内外的阶级敌人是在用尽各种方法来阻挠、破坏我们的社会主义建设事业的，胡风反革命集团是其中的一个；我们必须在胡风事件中吸取教训，提高我们的政治觉悟和政治敏感，不使敌人钻空子，挖尽一切潜藏的敌人。
