Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 28th – The Indonesian government decided at noon on the 27th to suspend the duties of acting Army Chief of Staff Zulkifli Lubis, on the grounds that he disobeyed government orders and refused to transfer his authority to the newly appointed Army Chief of Staff, Bambang Utoyo.

On the morning of the 27th, the newly appointed Army Chief of Staff Utoyo was sworn in at a ceremony held at the Presidential Palace. Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, all government ministers, and senior naval and air force officers attended the ceremony. Regional commanders did not attend the ceremony.

Acting Army Chief of Staff Lubis held a press conference a few hours later. He said that he did not agree with the appointment of Utoyo as Chief of Staff and had ordered all army personnel not to attend the inauguration ceremony. He said he was not prepared to hand over his authority, even though he knew that from a judicial point of view, his actions constituted "disobedience of orders."

Meanwhile, Utoyo, after taking office as Army Chief of Staff, said in response to questions from reporters that he had long expected resistance from the army commanders and anticipated more of this kind of "farce" in the coming days. He said, "This is a test that I must laugh off. What I have seen and heard has made my position even more firm."

    印度尼西亚政府决定
    停止代理陆军参谋长的职务
    新华社雅加达二十八日电　印度尼西亚政府在二十七日中午决定停止代理陆军参谋长佐基夫利·卢比斯的职务，理由是他违抗政府的命令，拒绝把他的权力移交给新任命的陆军参谋长班邦·乌多约。
    在二十七日上午，新任命的陆军参谋长乌多约在总统府举行的就职仪式上宣誓就职。参加仪式的有阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理，政府所有部长和海空军高级军官。地区司令官都没有参加仪式。
    代理陆军参谋长卢比斯在几小时后举行了记者招待会。他说，他不同意任命乌多约为参谋长，并已下令陆军的所有人员都不要参加就职仪式。他说，他不准备移交他的权力，虽然他知道从司法观点来看，他的行动构成“违抗命令”。
    同时，乌多约在就任陆军参谋长后，在答复记者向他提出的问题时说，他早已预料陆军的司令官们会加以抵制，并且预料在今后几天内还有这种笑话。他说，“这是我必须一笑置之的考验。我的所见所闻都使我的立场更加坚决。”
