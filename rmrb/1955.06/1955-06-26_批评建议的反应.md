    CPC Tong County Committee wrote: The "People's Daily" revealed the incident of Comrade Jiang Hongchun, Deputy Secretary of the Eighth District Committee of our county, and others suppressing criticism on June 6th, which is completely correct.
    Based on the criticism from the Party newspaper, the County Committee has decided to circulate this incident to all district and township Party organizations in the county for study and discussion, and to conduct a thorough inspection in light of the specific circumstances of the districts and townships to prevent similar incidents from happening. The directly responsible personnel for this mistake have also been given disciplinary actions: Dong Defu, former Secretary of the Party Branch of Gongzhufen Township, was placed on probation within the Party for one year. Jiang Hongchun, Deputy Secretary of the Eighth District Committee, has a good understanding and examination of the mistake and was given a public warning. It is recommended that the County People's Committee take appropriate action against non-Party personnel such as Zhao Guangqing.
