    The Ministry of Textile Industry, in its recent capital construction meeting, determined to save the country another 90 million yuan in funds from 1955 to 1957, based on the spirit of comprehensive economization and after detailed research.

    In accordance with the principle of focusing on key construction projects and the supply of raw cotton, the Ministry of Textile Industry has made several adjustments and reductions to capital construction investment within the first Five-Year Plan. This time, based on the spirit of comprehensive economization, it has focused on reducing some non-productive construction projects that are unnecessary or can be postponed, and lowering the construction costs of some non-productive buildings. Among the planned savings, about 45.61 percent will come from civil construction. The average cost per square meter of buildings such as dormitories and canteens will be reduced from more than 70 yuan to 35 yuan. The construction cost of the dormitory building of the new Sichuan Mianyang Silk Filature, which started construction this year, has already been reduced to 25 yuan per square meter; the construction area occupied by each household of staff and workers' family dormitories will also be reduced from 36 square meters to 25 square meters. The meeting also particularly emphasized the need to repair and use the construction sheds used by the engineering company as staff and worker dormitories after production begins. In this way, except for a few dormitory projects that have already started construction, the remaining hundreds of thousands of square meters of dormitory area for the seven new factories that started construction this year can be spared from construction. Among the reduced projects, some welfare facilities, such as nurseries, have been decided to be built later on the basis of future production development. Some projects are unnecessary, such as the new Shijiazhuang No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, which originally planned to build a large canteen in the staff and worker residential area that could accommodate 1,000 people at the same time. The canteen was to have terrazzo floors throughout and would also be equipped with a stage and many lighting facilities. Now, it has been decided to use the sheds left by the engineering company as a canteen, which can save an investment of 100,900 yuan.

    Under the premise of ensuring quality and production, the Ministry of Textile Industry has also made some reasonable modifications to productive construction. For example, the originally designed factory area of the new state-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory was relatively large. This time, after precise calculation and re-study of the arrangement of the machines, the area can be reduced by more than 1,000 square meters. The original design for the state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, Zhengzhou No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, and Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory required a total investment of more than 1.42 million yuan to build special railway lines. However, the transportation distance will be very short after these factories are completed, and railways are not needed. This time, the special railway line projects have been reduced. Other investments such as those in institutions, reserve funds, and material preparation fees have also been carefully calculated to save the country as much money as possible.

### 纺织工业部采取措施节约基本建设投资

    纺织工业部采取措施节约基本建设投资
    纺织工业部在最近召开的基本建设会议上，根据全面节约精神经过详细研究，确定从一九五五年到一九五七年再为国家节省资金九千万元。
    根据重点建设的方针和原棉供应的情况，纺织工业部曾对第一个五年计划内的基本建设投资作过几次的调整和削减，这次根据全面节约精神，又着重削减了一些可以不必办或可缓办的非生产性建筑项目，降低了一些非生产性建筑的造价。在这次计划节省的投资中，民用建筑方面节省的约占百分之四十五点六一。宿舍、食堂等建筑物，每平方公尺的平均造价将由七十多元降到三十五元，今年新建的四川绵阳缫丝厂的宿舍建筑造价已降到每平方公尺二十五元；职工家属宿舍每户所占的建筑面积也将由三十六平方公尺降到二十五平方公尺。会议并特别强调要利用工程公司施工用的工棚加以修理，作投入生产后的职工宿舍用。这样，今年开工的七个新建厂除了已经开工的少数宿舍工程外，其余几十万平方公尺面积的宿舍都可以不必建筑。在削减的项目中，有些福利设施如托儿所等，决定在将来生产发展的基础上再来兴建。有些是不必要的项目，如新建石家庄第三棉纺织厂原计划在职工住宅区内修建一座能同时容纳一千人吃饭的大食堂，食堂内将全部是水磨地面，还设有舞台和许多照明设备，现在决定利用工程公司留下来的工棚作食堂，就可节省投资十万零九千元。
    在保证质量、保证生产的前提下，纺织工业部对于生产性的建筑也作了某些合理的修改。如新建国营北京第三棉纺织厂原设计的厂房面积较大，这次经过精密计算，重新研究了机器的排列位置，就可以缩小面积一千多平方公尺。国营石家庄第三棉纺织厂、郑州第四棉纺织厂和北京第三棉纺织厂原设计共要投资一百四十二万多元，修建铁路专用线，但这几个厂建成后运输距离很短，并不需用铁路，这次就把这些专用线工程削减掉了。其他如事业单位的投资、预备费、备料费等，也都经过精打细算，尽可能地为国家节省了资金。（新华社）
