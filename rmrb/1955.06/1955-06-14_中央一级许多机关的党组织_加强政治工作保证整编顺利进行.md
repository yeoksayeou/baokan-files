Xinhua News Agency, June 13th - Communist Party organizations in many central-level agencies are actively strengthening political and ideological work to ensure the smooth progress of the staff reduction work.

In many agencies, Party organizations have conducted thorough mobilization, employing various methods tailored to the ideological situation of their staff during the staff reduction process. The Party organization of the Ministry of Finance actively promoted the significance of staff reduction during the mobilization and deliberation stages. Many Party members took the lead in guiding the masses to examine existing problems in staffing and work. When determining work tasks and formulating staffing plans, Party members guided the masses to carefully study and propose many appropriate suggestions. After the initial determination of the staffing plan, Party members expressed their firm support for the organization's decisions and their willingness to accept assignments, and they educated and assisted individuals with ideological concerns. The Party organization of the Ministry of Finance also paid attention to going deep into key units to understand the situation in a timely manner, summarizing experiences to promote staff reduction work. Some branches of the Ministry of Internal Affairs specifically analyzed the ideological situation of Party members and the masses during the staff reduction, and put forward specific requirements to Party groups and Party members. The vast majority of Party members in this ministry actively supported the staff reduction work, led the masses to launch discussions, and put forward suggestions, which enabled the staff reduction work to be carried out quickly.

In order to ensure the correct implementation of the Central Committee's guidelines and policies on staff reduction, Party organizations also paid special attention to criticizing erroneous ideas such as conservatism and departmentalism in the staff reduction work, as well as the erroneous practice of simply reducing the number of people without paying attention to improving work. The Party organizations of departments such as the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Culture sent staff members to form inspection teams together with the administrative departments to conduct in-depth inspections of key units. Through the specific facts revealed by the inspections, they criticized the erroneous ideas of some leading staff members who believed that "there are not many people in this unit, and it will be difficult to work if there are fewer people," and promoted the staff reduction work. The Party organization of the Ministry of Heavy Industry found that individual units planned to transfer too many female cadres, and some units showed a tendency to neglect the political qualities of staff members when allocating staff. The Party organization promptly put forward its opinions to the administrative leadership, making the adjustment and allocation of staff more reasonable.

Through this staff reduction work, many agency Party organizations also focused on educating staff members of state agencies to strictly abide by discipline and obey the unified allocation of the state. After education, many Party and non-Party cadres in many agencies such as the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized individualistic ideas, raised their awareness, and expressed their firm obedience to state allocation. Some agency Party organizations also passed resolutions expressing their firm obedience to the unified allocation of the state.

    中央一级许多机关的党组织
    加强政治工作保证整编顺利进行
    新华社十三日讯　中央一级许多机关的中国共产党组织积极加强政治思想工作，保证整编工作的顺利进行。
    很多机关的党组织在整编工作中，针对本机关工作人员的思想情况，采用多种方法深入进行了动员。财政部的党组织在整编工作的动员酝酿阶段，积极宣传整编的重要意义，许多党员带动群众检查了编制上和工作上存在的问题；在确定工作任务和制定编制方案时，党员引导群众仔细研究，提出了很多恰当的建议；编制方案初步确定后，党员们表示坚决拥护组织决定，服从分配，并对个别有思想顾虑的人进行教育和帮助。财政部的党组织还注意深入重点单位，及时了解情况，总结经验推动整编工作。内务部有些支部在整编中具体分析了党员和群众的思想情况，向党小组和党员提出了具体要求，这个部的绝大多数党员都积极拥护整编工作，带动群众展开讨论，提出建议，使整编工作很快地开展起来。
    党的组织为了保证正确地执行中央关于整编的方针和政策，还特别注意批判整编工作中的保守、本位主义等错误思想，以及不注意改进工作，单纯精简人数的错误做法。对外贸易部、文化部等部门的党组织，曾抽出工作人员和行政方面一道组成检查组，深入重点单位进行检查，通过检查出来的具体事实，批判了某些领导工作人员认为“本单位人不多、人少了不好工作”等错误想法，推动了整编工作。重工业部党组织发现个别单位计划调出女干部过多，有些单位分配工作人员时，有忽视工作人员政治品质的偏向；党的组织向行政领导方面及时提出了意见，使工作人员的调整和配备更加合理。
    通过这次整编工作，许多机关党的组织还着重向国家机关工作人员进行了严格遵守纪律、服从国家统一调配的教育。重工业部、内务部、外交部等许多机关的党与非党干部经过教育以后，批判了个人主义思想，提高了觉悟，表示坚决服从国家分配。有些机关党的组织还通过决议，表示坚决服从国家的统一调配。
