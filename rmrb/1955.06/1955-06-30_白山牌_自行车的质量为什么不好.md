    Why is the quality of "Baishan Brand" bicycles so poor?
    Zhang Yong
    The "Baishan Brand" bicycles produced by the state-owned Shenyang Bicycle Factory are now very difficult to buy in department stores across the country. This is not because "Baishan Brand" bicycles are selling too well; on the contrary, it is because the quality of these bicycles is very poor. The factory has no choice but to leave the bicycles they produce sleeping in warehouses, and even when the warehouses are full, they have to pile them up in the factory courtyard.
    In 1954, after the bicycles produced by the Shenyang Bicycle Factory were sent to department stores across the country, serious problems such as paint peeling, rusting, and weld cracking occurred. The number of bicycles that needed to be returned for repair or replacement reached more than 14,300. Of the more than 8,300 bicycles produced in the first quarter of this year, all had to be returned for repair before they even left the factory due to poor quality. Due to the poor quality, the losses incurred throughout last year and the first quarter of this year were at least 200,000 yuan, and the cost of each bicycle increased by an average of more than six yuan. From March to late May of this year, the Shenyang Bicycle Factory had to partially suspend production. For more than two months, no complete bicycles were officially produced, causing very large losses to the state.
    Why is the quality of bicycles produced by the Shenyang Bicycle Factory so poor? The factory's leading staff members believe: "The production task is large, and it is impossible to strictly control quality." It is true that the task is large, but is it therefore impossible to guarantee quality? Not at all. The Shenyang Bicycle Factory has been producing bicycles since liberation, and it is an old factory that produces only one type of product. It has all the necessary conditions to improve product quality. The root cause of the poor quality of bicycles is mainly that the factory's leading staff members have capitalist management ideas. They rarely consider ensuring the quality of bicycles to meet the needs of the people, but instead lower quality standards to meet the planned gross output value and gross commodity value. They are satisfied that the quality of "Baishan Brand" bicycles is much better than the bicycles produced in 1949, and believe that there is no problem with the quality. The main problem is how to ensure quantity. It is under the guidance of this kind of thinking that the phenomenon of poor bicycle quality has arisen.
    In order to simply pursue quantity, operating procedures are ignored, and operating time is arbitrarily shortened in the workshop. For example, after the frame is dipped in acid, it must be wiped with cold water, then placed in a hot water tank for 70 to 80 minutes, and then dried and painted. But in order to be fast, they pour it with a large bucket of cold water, put it in the hot water tank for only one or two minutes, and paint it without waiting for it to dry. In addition, the temperature is abnormal when baking the paint, which causes serious paint peeling. The electroplating chromium plating is originally stipulated to be 90 minutes, but they often only plate for 70 to 80 minutes, and some small parts are plated for only one or two minutes. Because the operating time is shortened, most of the wheel rims are only plated with one layer of thickness at most (the requirement is more than two layers), which is an important reason for rusting. Some parts that have been heat-treated are not ground smooth, so of course they do not turn flexibly. The leading staff members of the bicycle factory are very clear about these wrong practices, but they have never stopped them. Once, someone in the electroplating workshop proposed reducing the nickel plating time from 45 minutes to 40 minutes. Qiu Yushan, the head of the technical inspection section, disagreed. Later, Deputy Director Pan Zhixiang called Qiu Yushan and said: "Old Qiu, according to the current factory task situation, it can be shortened by five minutes!" Qiu Yushan insisted that the time could not be shortened, and said: "This will affect the electroplating quality. If the director insists on shortening it, I will report it to the bureau." Pan Zhixiang got angry and said angrily: "What! Can a section chief talk to the director like this?" In the end, he insisted on shortening the nickel plating time. Li Chaoyang, the deputy director in charge of production, often said to the inspectors: "I am not against improving quality, but returning for repair will cause losses, and we should also consider it! Besides, if we don't complete the 'national plan', we are all responsible!" The implication is that in order to ensure the completion of the task figures, the inspectors should relax the inspection standards. Last June, a large number of frames and mudguards that had been painted had cracks, and the inspectors proposed that they needed to be returned for repair. Jin Dianjun, the director of the paint baking workshop, said dissatisfied: "The country's transition to socialism is gradual! Improving quality must also be gradual!" Later, the inspector went to Deputy Director Li, and Deputy Director Li said: "Oh! This doesn't affect the quality much, why don't you let them pass?" For this matter, Deputy Director Pan also specially convened a meeting of inspectors, saying: "Don't let go of the slight pitting and scratches in the paint baking, how can the task be completed!" After the meeting, Ma Zhongqi, the head of the inspection team, said dejectedly: "It's really frustrating to be an inspector. If the inspection is loose, I'm sorry to the country and the people; if the inspection is strict, the director criticizes and the workshop cadres also make trouble. There's simply no way!"
    In the process of completing the production task, the bicycle factory does not study well how to improve and strengthen management, but often adopts surprise tactics. They regard the end-of-month rush as a "production law, an inevitable phenomenon." In late January of this year, Director Zhao Hanlin and others saw that the task was too far behind and there was a danger of not completing it, so they transferred almost all the manpower of the factory to the assembly workshop to rush. Among them were staff members, workers from other workshops, and even cart drivers, yard sweepers, and nurses from the clinic were mobilized to "participate in the battle" and rushed for more than ten days. The production volume on the 31st alone was more than 80 units more than the production volume in the first ten days of the month. After the task was completed, many workers couldn't even straighten their backs. But what about the quality? In March of this year, when it was determined to ship the assembled 2,085 boxes (totaling 8,340 units) of bicycles, it was found that 95% of the frames were scratched, the boxes were filled with undried straw, most of the wheel rims were rusted, and the installation quality was also terrible, so all had to be returned for repair.
    Because the leading staff members of the bicycle factory only care about completing the output task and ignore quality, the factory's technical management is also very chaotic. The most serious manifestation is that the design drawings are incomplete, there are many errors, and they do not play a good role in guiding production. The workers in the machining workshop never see the drawings when processing each part, but only do it according to the "round device" and "cardboard". Because the workers do not understand the specifications and dimensions of the processed parts, they often make some parts several sizes too large or too small. For example, when assembling the "rear fork small beam" processed by the workers, it was found that the length was not enough, and the technical data, product drawings, and molds were also inconsistent. Most of the work pressed by the workers with the mold did not conform to the drawings. When the inspector went to the technical section, Xie Baolin, the head of the design section, said: "This is nothing, just change the drawing!" They treat the product drawings as drawing exercises, and they can modify them as they please. There are also many products that do not have technical standards. There is also a different inspection standard for each person. Once, the workers processed the "large wheel disc". Because there was no technical standard, they did not know how wide the edge of the car should be, so they had to rely on experience. After it was done, the inspection was also qualified, and it was put into storage, but later, when assembling, it was found that more than 2,000 "wheel disc edges" were too small to be scrapped. There are many situations like this that cause a large number of defective products.
    After criticism from all sides, the leading staff members of the Shenyang Bicycle Factory have begun to pay attention to quality. They have examined and criticized the past erroneous thinking of only caring about quantity and ignoring quality, and have strengthened and improved technical management and production management. Judging from the situation of small-batch production of bicycles according to the newly revised standards since late May, the quality of the paint baking, electroplating, and weld joints of "Baishan Brand" bicycles has improved compared with the past. However, the Shenyang Bicycle Factory should further learn from the lessons of ignoring quality and causing great losses to the country in the past, and ensure that similar things do not happen again in the future.

### “白山牌”自行车的质量为什么不好

    “白山牌”自行车的质量为什么不好
    张永
    国营沈阳自行车厂生产的“白山牌”自行车，现在在各地百货公司已经很难买到了。这并不是因为“白山牌”自行车销路太好；相反，倒是因为这种自行车质量很坏。厂里不得不把生产出来的自行车放在仓库里睡觉，甚至仓库里堆满了，只好堆在工厂的院子里。
    一九五四年，沈阳自行车厂生产的自行车，送到各地百货公司后发生严重的掉漆、生锈、开焊等现象，需要退回返修或退换的就达一万四千三百多辆。今年第一季度刚生产的八千三百多辆也因质量不好，没等出厂就得全部返修。由于质量不好，去年全年和今年第一季度所造成的损失最低也得二十万元，平均每辆车的成本要增高六元多。从今年三月到五月下旬，沈阳自行车厂不得不部分停产，两个多月没有正式出成车，给国家造成的损失是非常巨大的。
    沈阳自行车厂生产的自行车为什么质量这样不好呢？工厂的领导工作人员认为：“生产任务大，无法严格控制质量。”任务大是事实，是不是因此就无法保证质量呢？完全不是。沈阳自行车厂从解放后就开始生产自行车，又是生产一种产品的老厂，完全有充分条件把产品质量搞好。产生自行车质量低劣的根本原因，主要是工厂的领导工作人员有资本主义经营思想。他们很少考虑保证自行车的质量去满足人民的要求，却不惜降低质量标准，去凑足生产总值和商品总值计划。他们满足于“白山牌”自行车的质量比一九四九年生产的自行车强多了，认为质量没啥问题，主要是如何保证数量。就是在这样的思想指导之下，自行车质量低劣的现象才产生了。
    为了单纯追求数量，操作规程被丢在一边了，车间里随意缩短操作时间。例如车架子在浸酸后必须用凉水擦，再在热水槽里放七八十分钟，然后干燥、打漆。但他们为了快，便用大桶的凉水浇，只放在热水槽里一两分钟就拿出，也不等干燥就打漆，加上烤漆时温度不正常，就产生了严重的掉漆现象。电镀镀铬本来规定是九十分钟，但他们常常只镀七八十分钟，有些小部件只镀一两分钟。因为操作时间缩短，大部分车圈最多只镀一道厚（要求是两道以上），这是造成生锈的重要原因。有些经过热处理后的部件，也不研磨光滑，当然就转的不灵活了。对于这些错误的做法，自行车厂领导工作人员是知道得很清楚的，然而一直没有制止。有一次电镀车间有人提出把镀镍时间由四十五分钟减少到四十分钟，技术检查科秋玉珊不同意这样做，后来副厂长潘志祥便打电话对秋玉珊说：“老秋，根据目前工厂任务情况，可以缩短五分钟！”秋玉珊坚持不能缩短时间，并说：“这样要影响电镀质量的，如果厂长一定要缩短，我就向局里汇报。”潘志祥动火了，生气地说：“怎么！你当股长的就同厂长这样讲话吗？”后来到底坚持把镀镍时间缩短了。负责生产的副厂长李朝阳常对检查人员说：“提高质量我不反对，但返修就会造成损失，也该考虑呀！再说如果完不成‘国家计划’，我们都有责任啊！”意思是说，为了保证完成任务数字，检查人员应该放宽检查尺度。去年六月烤完漆的大量车架子、挡泥板因有裂口现象，检查人员提出需要返修。烤漆车间主任金殿俊不满意地说：“国家向社会主义过渡还是逐步的哪！提高质量也得逐步才行呀！”后来检查员去找李副厂长，李副厂长说：“唉！这影响不了多大质量，为啥不给人家放过去呢？”为了这事，潘副厂长还特意召集检查人员开会，说：“烤漆有点麻子、道子都不放过，那任务怎能完成呢！”开过会，检查组长马仲琦泄气地说：“当检查员真憋气，检查松了对不住国家、人民；检查严了，厂长批评，车间干部也闹。简直没有办法！”
    在完成生产任务当中，自行车厂不是很好研究如何改进和加强管理工作，而是常常采取突击的办法。他们把月末突击看成是“生产规律，必然现象”。今年一月下旬，厂长赵翰林等看到任务拉下的太多了，有完不成的危险，几乎把全厂的人力都调到装配车间去突击。其中有工作人员，其他车间工人，甚至连赶大车的工人，扫院子的工人，医务所的护士也都动员来“参加战斗”，突击了十多天。仅三十一日那一天的生产量就比月初十天的生产量还多八十多台。任务完成后，许多工人连腰都直不起来了。可是质量呢？今年三月确定把装好了的两千零八十五箱（计八千三百四十台）自行车出厂时，发现有百分之九十五的车架子被碰掉漆了，箱里放着没有经过干燥的稻草，大部分车圈生锈了，安装质量也很糟糕，只好全部返修。
    由于自行车厂领导工作人员只顾完成产量任务，忽视质量，工厂的技术管理也很混乱。表现最严重的是设计图纸不全，错误多，没有很好地起到指导生产的作用。机械加工车间的工人在加工每个部件时，从来看不到图纸，只是照着“圆器”、
  “卡板”做。因为工人不了解加工部件的规格和尺寸，往往把一些部件做大或做小好几道。例如工人加工的“后叉小梁”，装配时发现长度不够，技术资料、产品图纸同模具也不一致，工人用模具压出的活，大部分同图纸不符合。检查员去找技术科时，技术科设计股长解宝林说：“这没有什么，把图改一改不就行了吗！”他们把产品图纸当成图画习作，愿怎么修改就怎么修改。还有许多产品是没有技术标准的。有检查标准也是一个人一个样。有一次工人加工“大轮盘”，因为没有技术标准，不知道车边究竟应该车多宽，只好凭经验干。做完后，检查也合格了，入库了，可是后来装配时发现二千多个“轮盘边”全车小了，只好作废。像这样造成大量废品的情形也是很多的。
    经过各方面的批评后，沈阳自行车厂领导工作人员已开始对质量有所重视。他们检查和批判了过去只顾数量，忽视质量的错误思想，并加强和改进了技术管理和生产管理工作。从五月下旬开始按新订标准车进行小批生产的情形看，“白山牌”自行车的烤漆、电镀、焊口等质量已较过去有了提高。但沈阳自行车厂应该进一步吸取过去忽视质量，给国家造成很大损失的教训，保证今后不再发生类似的事情。
