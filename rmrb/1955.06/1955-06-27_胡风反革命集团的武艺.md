Hu Feng and his group always talked about literature and art, but now the facts prove that what they never forgot was the anti-revolutionary manual – martial arts.

In their one hundred and sixty-nine secret letters, there is a real atmosphere of killing: strategies and tactics, weapons and ammunition, and even "whips made of steel wire wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners." It can be said that "all things are prepared for me." This "subjective" commander stands at the center of the "maze," looking at the "flags all over the mountains," issuing orders, throwing out "cluster grenades," and conducting "fierce shooting"!

Who do they have such an irreconcilable hatred for? Communist Party members and progressive writers!

They have thus "practiced" the "psychological warfare" peculiar to American military science in a planned, organized, and strategic way, and fought a twenty-year "war of attrition" with a "do or die" attitude.

Some people think that their weapons are nothing more than cursing, slandering, rumor-mongering, and nonsense, without real swords and guns, and are ultimately different from their "Sino-American Cooperation Institute" and "Central Statistics Bureau" friends. In fact, Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary methods are more terrible and cruel than knives and guns. After Mr. Wen Yiduo was sacrificed by an American-made silent pistol, Hu Feng still refused to let go, throwing out the dirty word "speculation" to slander the lofty and pure soul. Doesn't this prove that Hu Feng's "subjective" fierce weapons are more cruel than any knives and guns?

Now they are in a "disadvantageous strategic position" where "everyone shouts and beats them like rats crossing the street." Before they crawl into any hole, everyone should shout and beat them, and really beat them.

Forgiveness to the enemy is cruelty to comrades.

    胡风反革命集团的武艺
    罗稷南
    胡风及其集团的分子开口文艺，闭口文艺，现在事实证明他们所念念不忘的却是反革命的拳经——武艺。
    在他们的一百六十九封密信里，真是充满了杀伐气氛：战略战术，武器弹药，甚至“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”也有，可以说是“万物皆备于我”了。这位“主观”司令官就站在“疑阵”中心，望着“遍山旗帜”，发号施令，抛出“集束手榴弹”，进行“猛烈的射击”！
    他们跟谁有这样不共戴天之仇呢？共产党员和进步作家！
    他们就这样有计划，有组织，有策略地“实践”着美国军事学上特有的“心理战”，“一不做，二不休”地打了二十年“挖心战”。
    有人以为他们的武器总不过是臭骂，丑诋，造谣，胡说，并没有真刀真枪，到底跟他们的“中美合作所”和“中字处”的朋友们有所不同。其实胡风的反革命手段比刀枪更可怕，更凶残。闻一多先生牺牲于美造无声手枪之后，胡风还死不放松，抛出“投机”这秽语来污蔑崇高纯洁的灵魂，这不是证明胡风们的“主观”凶器比任何刀枪更凶残了么？
    现在他们已经处于“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的“劣势战略地位”。而在他们还未钻进什么洞里去之前，人人应该喊打，而且要真打。
    对敌人宽恕就是对同志残酷。
