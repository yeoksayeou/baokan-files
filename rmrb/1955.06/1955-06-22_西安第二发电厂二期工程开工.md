    Xi'an Second Power Plant Phase II project officially commenced construction on June 15th. It is expected that some of the new machinery will be officially operational and generating electricity around August or September of 1956. The entire project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 1957.
    The scale of the Xi'an Second Power Plant Phase II project is three times that of Phase I. Upon completion of Phase II, the power generation capacity of the Xi'an area participating in unified dispatch will increase by nearly eight times compared to 1949. The power generation capacity of Phase II alone will be equal to 180 percent of the current total power generation capacity of the city participating in unified dispatch. In addition to supplying power to some factories and enterprises in the suburbs of Xi'an, this power plant will also supply steam and hot water needed by some factories and enterprises near the plant.
    The degree of automation of the mechanical equipment in the Xi'an Second Power Plant Phase II project is higher than that of Phase I, and more attention has been paid to implementing the principles of safety, rationality, and economy in the design. For example, the standby power supply line is equipped with an automatic connection device. If a fault occurs in the normal operating line, the specially designed standby line will automatically go into operation, ensuring that the user's power supply is not interrupted. Another example is that the office building has been decided not to be newly built, and it is planned to renovate and expand the existing chemical water treatment room for utilization, which will save the country a large amount of investment.

### 西安第二发电厂二期工程开工

    西安第二发电厂二期工程开工
    西安第二发电厂二期工程已经在六月十五日正式开工。预计到一九五六年八、九月间，部分新机器就可以正式运转，开始发电。到一九五七年第三季度，全部工程可以完工。
    西安第二发电厂二期工程的规模等于一期工程的三倍。二期工程完工以后，西安地区参加统一调度的发电容量将比一九四九年增加近八倍；仅二期工程的发电能力，就等于目前全市参加统一调度的发电能力的百分之一百八十。这个发电厂除了将供应西安城郊一些工厂企业的动力用电外，还将供应电厂附近一些工厂企业需用的蒸气和热水。
    西安第二发电厂二期工程机械设备的自动化程度比一期工程更高，设计中也更加注意贯彻了安全、合理和经济等原则。例如，备用供电线路设有自动接通装置，如果正常运行线路一旦发生故障，特设的备用线路就自动投入运转，保证用户用电不至间断。又如办公大楼决定不另新建，准备把现有的化学水处理室改建和扩建后加以利用，这样就为国家节省了很大一批投资。
