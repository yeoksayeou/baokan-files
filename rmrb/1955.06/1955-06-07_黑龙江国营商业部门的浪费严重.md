Serious Waste in State-Owned Commercial Departments of Heilongjiang

    The phenomenon of waste in state-owned commercial departments in Heilongjiang Province is serious. In Harbin City Food Company alone, more than 50 waste incidents occurred last year, with documented waste totaling more than 570,000 yuan.

    The leading staff of this company have long held the erroneous idea that "waste is unavoidable," openly declaring: "The commercial situation is special, and waste is inevitable. It is impossible to avoid losing money in food work. As long as the supply is guaranteed, the higher authorities know about the losses." Here, waste has become legitimate.

    The chaos in the Livestock Processing Plant under this company has reached an intolerable level. More than a hundred stray dogs are supported by the processing plant. If pigs or cattle die, or meat deteriorates, the storekeeper can throw them away without anyone interfering. Wholesale stores can issue their own slips to transport goods out of the warehouse. Private merchants and temporary workers can also enter and exit the warehouse at will. Employees can freely drink, gamble, and fight during working hours. Some embezzlers have been discovered, with the largest embezzlement amounting to more than 2,000 yuan. Due to the confusion in accounts and the discrepancy between accounts and goods, it is impossible to ascertain exactly how much has been stolen and wasted. Once, regarding the processing of casings for export, the processing section chief said: “It’s under the management of storage and transportation.” The storage and transportation section chief said: “It’s under the management of processing.” The workers said: “If you don’t manage it, I won’t either.” They allowed all the small intestines to rot and become maggot-infested. In the summer, the pigsties are not cleaned for a long time, and the mud is two feet deep. The pigs sink into the mud, trampling on each other, and no one manages them, resulting in dozens of deaths a day. Cattle are drenched in the rain and left hungry and cold during grazing, resulting in the death of twenty-seven in one instance. The waste rate of pigs sometimes reaches 50 percent. According to records, this factory discarded more than 5,800 pigs and more than 90,000 jin of deteriorated pork last year, resulting in a loss of more than 240,000 yuan. Last year, this factory lost more than 800,000 yuan, but the exact amount of waste and loss is still a mystery.

    Waste caused by blind procurement is also very serious. For example, last summer, a contract for 1.2 million jin of yellow croaker was signed with Dalian, which was sufficient to supply the market. However, without studying the market situation or understanding the abundant freshwater fish production in the Songhua River last year, they had a flash of inspiration and ordered more than 200,000 jin of yellow croaker from Qingdao, and fearing it was "not enough," they ordered 530,000 jin of frozen yellow croaker and 600,000 jin of semi-salted yellow croaker from Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places. Suddenly, more than 2 million jin of sea fish and river fish flooded into Harbin, and the time was in the hot summer. The first batch of fresh yellow croaker deteriorated before it could be disposed of. The frozen yellow croaker stored in cold storage had to be sent to the market because the cold storage was needed for other urgent tasks (the cold storage was rented). Before the frozen fish problem was resolved, the semi-salted yellow croaker began to turn red due to the hot weather. Although prices were repeatedly lowered for dumping, the problem could not be completely solved, and in the end, they could only be discarded by the truckload. This time, the loss from frozen yellow croaker alone was more than 90,000 yuan. Blind procurement coupled with irresponsibility made the waste even more serious. Last October, 120,000 jin of bananas were blindly purchased from Guangzhou. Although there were too many goods at one time, losses could have been completely avoided with timely measures. However, after the goods arrived at the company, no one was responsible, and they were left unprocessed in the warehouse (bananas need to be smoked before they can be sold). Although the warehouse management personnel repeatedly urged timely processing, the person responsible for processing the bananas said: "If they are left in the warehouse, they will rot; if they are processed and cannot be sold, they will also rot. Anyway, they will rot." After dragging on for half a month, the good bananas turned black in piles and 90 percent rotted. Such distressing and infuriating things are constantly happening here.

    We do not deny that commercial departments have many objective difficulties, such as inadequate equipment conditions and a lack of experience in grasping market conditions. However, analyzing many specific waste incidents, most are caused by subjective factors. Objective difficulties cannot be used as an excuse to cover up mistakes.

    Not long ago, Jiamusi City Food Company and Hegang City Food Company transported large quantities of live pigs from more than 200 li away. The former encountered six days and nights of blizzards during transport, but none of the pigs died and all arrived safely at their destination. The latter did not encounter blizzards during transport, but more than 90 percent of the live pigs died or were slaughtered urgently.

    The reason is that the two food companies adopted different attitudes towards state property. When Jiamusi City Food Company accepted the task of allocating a large number of live pigs, it first carefully selected model purchasing agent Guo Xingbiao to carry out the task. This model purchasing agent made full preparations in advance. Although he worked very hard along the way, his hat brim was covered with frost, and he walked on the slippery and thick snow road, he still worked tirelessly to catch up and solve the problem of food and lodging for the pigs along the way. After settling down every day, he would always check the pigsty and thicken the straw in the pigsty, and often lead the pigs to stretch their legs (for fear that the pigs' legs would be numb and unable to walk), for which he often only slept for two hours. In this way, he safely crossed the Woken River Bridge and fought against the strong winds and blizzards for six days and nights, finally completing the task of transporting 500 live pigs without any losses.

    When Hegang City Food Company accepted the task of allocating this batch of live pigs, a irresponsible attitude was adopted from top to bottom. The person in charge of transportation was a drunkard named Yao Chuanjiang who had to drink at every meal. He did not make any preparations in advance, and only fed the pigs six meals in seven days and nights, sometimes not feeding them for two days and two nights, and the pigs could only eat snow to satisfy their hunger. There was no straw to spread after reaching the accommodation, and the pigs could only sleep on the snow in the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius. No one was responsible for the large pig herd of more than ten li, and Yao Chuanjiang stayed away from the pig herd all day, sleeping drunkenly in the back cart, not caring about anything. Due to hunger, thirst, cold, and pressure, 240 live pigs died or were slaughtered urgently along the way. After arriving at the destination, although the company manager witnessed the serious death of live pigs, he only said lightly: "They are tired, they will be fine after a rest." If they were properly fed after the pigs entered the pen, most of the losses could still be recovered. However, the feeding conditions here were very bad. There were no pigsties or pig troughs, and the live pigs could only be kept with cattle, resulting in the strong bullying the weak, and the pigs still could not get food or drink. The mortality rate rose sharply, with 1,170 deaths and emergency slaughters in nine days, and the remaining dozens were dying. Even more absurdly, under the nonsense of the epidemic prevention personnel that "suspected epidemic, all slaughtering should be stopped," they publicized: "The death of live pigs is not man-made, but is an irresistible force!" The company manager made the mistake and held an emergency meeting and allocated funds to build a cremation furnace, attempting to burn the dead pigs to ashes. (Fortunately, the superior authorities stopped it). Later, the province sent technicians to dissect the dead pigs and found that there was no feces in the pigs' stomachs and intestines, and the intestines were stuck together, proving that it was all man-made "epidemic." This incident not only caused serious losses to the state but also had a very bad impact, and the nearby farmers were very angry.

    Such absurd behavior as that of Hegang City Food Company exists not only in the food, native products, and other departments, but also in other commercial departments. According to recent information, many imported hardware materials have deteriorated in the hardware warehouse in Harbin. The situation of paper deterioration and inability to use in the department store system is also very serious. The relevant departments are further investigating the reasons. This is only one aspect of the waste in the Heilongjiang commercial system, and the waste caused by poor management may be even more serious.

    Due to the weakness of political and ideological work over a long period of time, the idea of cherishing state property among the staff of many enterprises in the Heilongjiang commercial departments is relatively weak, and the phenomenon of lack of responsibility is also relatively common. Especially since the "Three-Anti" movement, the struggle against waste has not been actively launched for a long time, and those who have committed heinous acts against people's property have not been criticized and punished as they should be, which has made the waste situation increasingly serious. Even more serious is that some leaders turn a blind eye to this phenomenon, are numb, and in fact condone this chaotic and absurd behavior. At present, it is a very necessary and urgent task to actively launch a struggle against waste in the Heilongjiang commercial departments. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to stop this heinous act of wasting state property.

    黑龙江国营商业部门的浪费严重
    金雨困　铁英
    黑龙江省国营商业部门的浪费现象是严重的。仅哈尔滨市食品公司去年一年中，发生的浪费事件就有五十多次，有账可查的浪费数字达五十七万元之多。
    这个公司的领导工作人员长期存在着“浪费不可避免”的错误思想，公开宣称：“商业情况特殊，浪费在所难免，做食品工作更不能不赔钱，只要能保证供应，赔钱上级都知道。”在这里，浪费已成为合法的了。
    这个公司所属的畜产加工厂，混乱状况已到了使人难以容忍的程度。靠着加工厂养活的野狗有百多条。猪牛死亡或肉类变质了，保管员擅自扔掉也无人干涉。批发商店可以自己开条子把货运出仓库。私商和临时工人也都可以随意出入仓库。职工在工作时间可以任意酗酒、赌钱和打架。现已发现一些贪污分子，最多的贪污数达二千多元。由于账目混乱，账货不符，因此究竟被盗窃浪费了多少也无法查清。有一次，加工出口肠衣，加工股长说：
  “归储运管。”储运股长说：“归加工管。”工人说：
  “你们都不管，我也不管。”就听任小肠全部腐烂生蛆。在夏天，猪圈长期不清理，泥泞深达二尺，猪身陷入泥里，互相踩踏，无人管理，一天就死亡几十头；牛在放牧时被雨淋湿，饥寒无人照顾，一次就死了二十七头。猪的废弃率有时高达百分之五十。仅有账可查的，去年这个厂共废弃猪五千八百多头，猪肉变质九万多斤，损失达二十四万多元。去年这个厂一共亏蚀了八十多万元，但究竟浪费损失了多少，至今还是一笔糊涂账。
    由于盲目采购造成的浪费也是十分严重的。如去年夏天已经同大连订好一百二十万斤的黄花鱼合同，满可供应市场需要。但他们既不研究市场情况，也不了解松花江去年淡水鱼丰产的情况，灵机一动，又向青岛订购了二十多万斤黄花鱼，还怕
  “不够”，又在上海青岛等地订购了五十三万斤冻黄鱼，六十多万斤半腌黄鱼。一下子涌进哈尔滨的海鱼、江鱼就二百多万斤，而时间又正在炎热的夏天。第一批鲜黄鱼变质还未处理完，储在冷库的冻黄鱼因人家有紧急任务需要冷库（冷库是租用的），不得不倒库把冻鱼送上市场，冻鱼问题还未处理完，半腌的黄鱼又因天气炎热开始发红。虽然一再削价倾销，仍不能完全解决问题，最后只能用汽车整车整车丢弃了事。这一次，仅冻黄鱼一项即损失了九万多元。盲目采购再加上不负责任，浪费就更加严重。去年十月从广州盲目采购了十二万斤香蕉，虽一时货来得太多了些，但及时采取措施，损失是完全可以避免的。但货物到公司后由于无人负责，搁在仓库也不加工（香蕉需熏后才能出售），虽然仓库管理人员一再督促要及时处理，但负责处理这批香蕉的人却说：“放在仓库里要烂，加工了卖不出去也要烂，反正总得烂。”拖了半个月，好香蕉都黑成一堆一堆，烂掉了百分之九十。像这样令人痛心和愤慨的事情，在这里是不断发生的。
    我们并不否认商业部门有许多客观困难，例如设备条件不够完善，对市场情况的掌握还缺乏经验等等。但是，从许多具体的浪费事件来分析，大部都是由于主观因素造成。客观困难并不能成为掩盖错误的借口。
    不久前，佳木斯市食品公司和鹤岗市食品公司都从二百多里地以外赶运大批活猪。前者在赶运途中遇到了六昼夜的大风雪，但运的猪无一死亡，全部安全到达了目的地。后者在赶运途中，没有遇到风雪，但所赶的活猪，却死亡和急宰了百分之九十以上。
    原来这两个食品公司对国家财富采取了不同的态度。佳木斯市食品公司在接受大批活猪调拨任务时，首先慎重地选择了模范采购员郭兴标来执行这个任务。这位模范采购员在事先作好了充分准备，一路上虽然非常辛苦，帽沿上带满寒霜，走着又滑又厚的雪路，但仍然不辞劳苦地赶前赶后，解决途中猪的食宿问题。每天住下以后，他总要在猪圈旁检查，加厚猪圈铺草，不时带领猪群溜腿（怕猪腿压麻后不能走路），为此经常只睡两个小时。他就这样平安地渡过倭肯河桥，和狂风暴雪搏斗了六昼夜，终于无一损失地完成了五百头活猪的赶运任务。
    而鹤岗市食品公司在接受这批活猪调拨任务时，从上到下都采取了不负责任的态度。担负赶运任务的是一个每餐必喝酒的酒徒姚传江。他在事先没有作任何准备，途中七天一夜仅给猪喂了六顿食，有时两天两夜不喂，猪只能啃雪充饥。到宿地后连铺草也没有，猪群只能冒着零下二十度严寒睡在雪地上。长达十多里的大猪群无人负责，而姚传江却终日远离猪群，醉薰薰地睡在后边的大车上，什么事也不管。一路上由于饿、渴、冻、压，活猪死亡和急宰的就有二百四十多头。到目的地后，公司经理虽然目睹活猪死亡情况严重，但只是轻描淡写地说：“是累的，歇歇乏就好了。”猪入圈后本来只要好好饲养，大部损失还可以挽回。但这里的饲养条件十分恶劣，连猪圈和猪食槽子都没有，活猪只能同牛关在一起，结果牛踩猪，强欺弱，猪还是吃不到喝不着。死亡率急遽上升，九天中死亡和急宰了一千一百七十多头，剩下的几十头也奄奄待毙了。更荒唐的是在防疫人员“疑似疫情，一律停止屠宰”的胡说下，就大肆宣传：“生猪的死不是人为的，原是人力不可抗拒的呀！”公司经理将错就错地召开紧急会议，并拨款修造了一座炼尸炉，企图将死猪付之一炬。（幸亏上级机关制止了）。后来省里派技术人员来解剖死猪，发现猪胃肠里已经没有一点粪便，肠子都黏起来了，证明全是人为的
  “疫情”。这件事情不仅使国家遭受了严重损失，而且造成了极坏的影响，附近农民都十分愤慨。
    像鹤岗市食品公司这样荒唐的行为不仅存在食品、土产等部门，而且也同样存在在其他商业部门。据最近了解，哈尔滨的五金仓库中，许多进口的五金器材已经变质。百货系统中纸张变质不能使用的情况也十分严重。现有关部门正在进一步检查原因。这里仅仅是黑龙江商业系统浪费的一个方面，而在其它方面，如由于经营管理不善而造成的浪费，可能还要更加严重得多。
    由于长时期来政治思想工作薄弱，在黑龙江商业部门的不少企业里，职工爱护国家财富的思想是比较淡薄的，缺乏责任心的现象也比较普遍，特别自“三反”运动以后，长时期没有积极展开反浪费斗争，对人民财产采取罪恶行为的人没有受到应有的批评和处分，这就使浪费情况日益严重。而更严重的是一些领导人员对这种现象熟视无睹，麻木不仁，在实际上纵容了这种混乱的荒唐的行为。目前，在黑龙江商业部门中积极展开反浪费的斗争是十分必要、十分紧迫的任务。必须发动群众起来制止这种糟踏国家财富的罪恶行为。
