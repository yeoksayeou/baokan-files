    Indian Cultural Delegation Visits the Great Wall
    (Our report) The entire members of the Indian Cultural Delegation visited the Great Wall on the 29th.
    The distinguished guests arrived at Badaling at 12:10 PM.
    The scorching sun beat down on the ground at noon, but the distinguished guests still climbed the Great Wall with great interest. Mr. Chand led the way up. Standing on the Great Wall, the distinguished guests gazed at the distant green mountains and the lush green crops at the foot of the mountains. They lingered for a long time admiring this excellent scenery. Mr. Vaidyanathan said, "This is the first time in my life I have seen such a view."
    The distinguished guests enjoyed a pleasant picnic in the suburbs. After the meal, the Indian dancers and the young Chinese dancers happily performed Indian dances together.
    Mr. Chand and his wife also visited the Ming Tombs on their way back.

    印度文化代表团游览长城
    本报讯　印度文化代表团全体团员二十九日游览了长城。
    十二时十分贵宾们到达八达岭。
    中午炙热的太阳直射着地面，但贵宾们仍兴致勃勃地登上了长城。钱达先生领先爬了上去。贵宾们站在长城上眺望着远处青色的山，和山底下油绿的庄稼。他们许久地留恋着这幅出色的风景。瓦伊迪雅纳丹先生说：“我有生以来第一次看到这样的景色。”
    贵宾们愉快地在郊外野餐。饭后，印度的舞蹈家和中国的青年舞蹈家高兴地跳起了印度舞。
    钱达先生和夫人在归途中还游览了十三陵。
