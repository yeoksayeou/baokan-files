A working group from the Gansu Provincial Horticultural Experiment General Farm, conducting trials in Xiahe, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, has seen cabbage and cauliflower emerge from the soil and grow normally; beans, cucumbers, eggplants, pumpkins, and wax gourds have also begun to germinate.

In the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, apart from a few Han Chinese who grow some chives and green onions, the herdsmen rely on Linxia Prefecture for their vegetable supply. Due to the long distance and high prices, the herdsmen rarely get to eat vegetables, and some can't eat them at all year-round. To solve this problem, the Gansu Provincial Horticultural Experiment General Farm has introduced many nutritious vegetables from Lanzhou for trial cultivation. The local herdsmen were very happy to see this.

    甘南藏族自治区试种蔬菜
    甘肃省园艺试验总场工作组在甘南藏族自治区夏河试种的甘蓝、花椰菜已经出土，生长正常；豆角、黄瓜、茄子、蕃瓜、冬瓜也已经开始发芽。
    甘南藏族自治区除了少数汉民种一点韭菜和大葱外，牧民食用蔬菜要靠临夏专区供给。因路远价贵，牧民很少能吃到蔬菜，有的甚至一年四季也吃不到。甘肃省园艺试验总场为解决这一问题，特从兰州引种了许多有营养价值的蔬菜，进行试种工作。当地牧民看到后，非常高兴。
