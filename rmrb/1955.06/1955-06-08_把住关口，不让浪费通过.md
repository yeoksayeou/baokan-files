    Guard the Pass, Don't Let Waste Through

    Doing a good job of design review is a positive measure to overcome waste in basic construction. Strict and meticulous review of designs can often reveal many areas of waste; correcting these wastes in time to prevent them from becoming reality can save a lot of basic construction investment.

    The recent review of the preliminary design of the Wuhan Boiler Factory organized by the First Ministry of Machine Building Design Bureau and the Fourth Machine Industry Administration by engineering and technical personnel from relevant agencies vividly proves this point.

    The Wuhan Boiler Factory was designed by the Second Design Branch of the First Ministry of Machine Building. Originally, the design of any factory should and must consider future development. However, this consideration must have sufficient basis and should not be planned excessively without limit. At the same time, the division of labor with other factories should be considered, and efforts should be made to achieve production specialization; in this way, labor productivity can be improved and investment can be relatively small. When the Fourth Machine Industry Administration of the First Ministry of Machine Building determined the planning task book for the Wuhan Boiler Factory, it stipulated that the factory's future vision was to cooperate with the Shanghai Turbine Factory in producing complete sets of power generation equipment, so the output should be adapted to the output of the Shanghai Turbine Factory. In terms of variety, it was stipulated that only grate-type medium-pressure boilers would be produced. However, the person who designed this factory had the idea of pursuing greatness and comprehensiveness, and the development capacity reserved in the preliminary design exceeded the regulations by a factor of two. In terms of products, it was also planned to produce pulverized coal boilers, pulverized coal equipment, and high-pressure vessels. As a result, some workshops were designed with unreasonable internal layouts and architectural forms because of considering multiple aspects of development; moreover, unnecessary overhead cranes were added (if roofs were added to the steel frames of these cranes, they would become an extra large workshop). In order to meet the "long-term vision" of future development, in addition to all the workshops being designed with vacant land and equipment for future development, a whole piece of vacant land of seven hectares was reserved. The factory area was expanded, the earthwork naturally increased, the overall layout was very loose, and various pipelines, railways, and roads were lengthened, resulting in increased investment. During the review, the personnel participating in the review carefully reviewed each project in accordance with the spirit of the state's saving basic construction investment. After discovering these shortcomings, they revised the unreasonable parts, cancelled unnecessary projects, and reduced the factory area by 4.5 hectares. This reduced the investment by 250,000 yuan while still retaining sufficient development conditions.

    In this preliminary design, the labor productivity of the steam drum workshop was estimated to be too low, the equipment used was not advanced, and the equipment load was not high; compared with another foreign-designed boiler factory with the same equipment, it was far behind. After review and research, it was felt that these major equipment in the two factories should strive to be shared. It is planned to focus on considering and deciding this issue during the technical design. If it is possible to share, then the construction of the steam drum workshop of the Wuhan Boiler Factory can be delayed, and 6 million yuan can be saved in equipment and construction costs.

    The originally designed office buildings and other buildings were prepared to use many glazed tile roofs and other unnecessary decorations. After review, these decorations were removed, and some steel windows were changed to wooden windows, reducing the investment by more than 200,000 yuan in total. Changing the steel roof trusses of the two workshops to reinforced concrete roof trusses saved more than 89,000 yuan. Changing the original design of more than 5,000 square meters of wooden block flooring in one workshop to concrete flooring reduced the cost per square meter from 24 yuan to 9 yuan.

    The quota of management personnel used in the original design was also too high. After careful calculation during the review, the number of people could be reduced by 29.6 percent. In this way, not only could the office building used by the management personnel be reduced by more than 1,200 square meters, but also the canteen, dormitory, and other welfare facilities could be greatly reduced accordingly.

    The final result of the review and modification was: excluding the 6 million yuan in investment that could be saved by delaying the construction of the steam drum workshop, other projects reduced the investment by nearly 5 million yuan in total, equivalent to about 8 percent of the total investment. This shows that the waste in the original design was quite serious, and it also shows that if the review work is carried out seriously, it can play a considerable role in preventing waste.

    把住关口，不让浪费通过
    蒋炳樾
    做好设计的审核工作，是克服基本建设中的浪费的一个积极措施。严格、细致地审核设计往往可以发现很多浪费的地方；及时纠正这些浪费，使它不致变成事实，就可以大量节省基本建设投资。
    第一机械工业部设计总局同第四机器工业管理局最近组织有关机关的工程技术人员对武汉锅炉厂初步设计的审查，生动地证明了这一点。
    武汉锅炉厂是第一机械工业部第二设计分局设计的。本来，设计任何一个工厂，都应该而且必须考虑到将来的发展。但是，这种考虑必须有足够的根据，不能漫无限制地规划得过大。同时应该考虑到同其他工厂的分工，尽量做到生产专业化；这样，劳动生产率就能提高，投资也比较少。第一机械工业部第四机器工业管理局在确定武汉锅炉厂的计划任务书时，规定了这个厂的发展远景是配合上海汽轮机厂生产整套的发电设备，因此产量应该同上海汽轮机厂的产量相适应。在品种上，规定只生产炉篦式中压锅炉。但是，设计这个工厂的人有好大求全的思想，初步设计中留出的发展能力竟超过了规定的一倍。在产品方面，还打算生产粉煤式锅炉、粉煤设备和高压容器。这样，就使得一部分车间因为考虑多方面的发展，内部布置和建筑形式都设计得不合理；而且增加了不必要的露天吊车（如果在这些吊车的钢架上加上屋顶，就成了一个额外的大车间）。为了符合将来发展的“远景”，除了所有的车间都设计了准备发展的空地和设备外，又预留了一块七公顷大的整块空地。厂区面积扩大了，土方工程自然增多，总平面布置也很松散，各种管道、铁路、道路都因而加长，结果就增加了投资。审查时参加审查的人员，根据国家节约基本建设投资的精神，认真对各个项目进行了审查。发现了这些缺点之后，修正了不合理的地方，取消了不必要的项目，将厂区面积缩小了四点五公顷。这样就减少了二十五万元投资，而仍然保留了足够的发展条件。
    在这份初步设计里面，把汽包车间的劳动生产率估计得太低，采用的设备不先进，设备负荷也不高；和有同样设备的另一个国外设计的锅炉厂相比，落后很多。经审核研究，觉得这两个厂这些重大的设备应该争取共用。拟在技术设计时着重考虑决定这一问题。如果可能共用，那末，武汉锅炉厂的汽包车间就可以缓建，在设备和建筑费用上可以节约六百万元。
    原设计的办公室等建筑，准备用很多琉璃瓦大屋顶等不必要的装饰。审查后，把这些装饰去掉了，又把部分钢窗改用了木窗，一共减少了投资二十多万元。把两个车间的钢屋架改为钢筋混凝土屋架，节省了八万九千多元。把一个车间原设计的五千多平方公尺的木块地坪改成了混凝土地坪，每平方公尺的造价由二十四元减到了九元。
    原设计中采用的管理人员定额也过高。审查时仔细计算了一下，人数可以减去百分之二十九点六。这样，不仅使管理人员使用的办公大楼减少一千二百多平方公尺，而且食堂、宿舍和其他福利设施也都可以相应地大大减少。
    审核修改的最后结果是：除汽包车间缓建可节省投资六百万元不计外，其他项目共减少了投资将近五百万元。相当于投资总额的百分之八左右。这说明原设计的浪费是相当严重的，也说明如果认真地进行审核工作，对防止浪费的作用也是相当大的。
