Lessons from Rectifying Rural Grain Unified Purchase and Sale Work

The nationwide rectification of rural grain unified purchase and sale work has achieved significant results. Its direct outcome is the control and reduction of unreasonable grain sales in rural areas, bringing rural grain unified purchase and sale conditions towards normalcy. At the same time, it has also raised the awareness of rural staff and the broad masses of farmers, exposed many problems in rural grain unified purchase and sale work, and laid the foundation for the improvement of the grain unified purchase and sale system. Many of these beneficial experiences and lessons must be remembered.

Before the rectification of rural grain unified purchase and sale work, grain sales in many rural areas in East China, Central South, and North China were once quite tense. Whether in cities or rural areas, some people said that this was because "too much was bought from farmers" and "too little was sold in rural areas." Some of these people were unaware of the truth and simply repeated what others said, while others were deliberately confusing right and wrong, using this as an opportunity to attack the government's unified purchase and sale policy and undermine the trust of the masses of farmers in the government. In fact, since the implementation of grain unified purchase and sale, the agricultural tax and unified purchased grain that the state collects from farmers each year is less than one-third of the total grain production, and nearly half of this is sold back to rural areas; on average, each farmer can have more than 500 jin of grain per year, which is sufficient, and if used properly, there can be a slight surplus. This is a basic situation in China's economic life. The argument that "too much is purchased" and "too little is sold" is unfounded.

Failing to investigate and analyze specific facts, simply echoing others' discussions on grain issues, and creating a frightening atmosphere is the most damaging thing one can do, and to correctly solve the grain problem, we must first fight against this irresponsible attitude. For example, in the spring of this year, farmers in Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, repeatedly reported to county, district, and village-level staff that they did not have enough grain and requested increased supplies. The County Party Committee was also misled by this false impression and once lost confidence, abandoning leadership, which led to a chaotic state in the county's grain unified sale work. Later, with the help of the higher-level Party Committee, the County Party Committee first calculated an overall account: In 1954, Dingxiang County had a good harvest, and after deducting the public grain collected by the state and the unified purchased grain, plus the grain sold by the state under the unified system, the county had an average of about 560 jin of grain per person, which was more than enough. The claim of a grain shortage was completely wrong. Next, the County Party Committee conducted typical investigations in some villages where grain supply was most strained: In Zhimcun Township, Dingxiang County, 1954 was a bumper year, with a total of 1,117 households in the township. More than 156,000 jin of grain was purchased under the unified system, averaging less than 140 jin purchased from each household; however, due to man-made tension, supply certificates were issued to 1,080 households this spring, accounting for more than 96% of the total number of households, and more than 320,000 jin of grain was supplied, more than double the amount purchased under the unified system! Even so, many farmers still said they "had no food to eat" and asked the state to continue supplying grain. Isn't the extreme irrationality of the grain supply situation obvious? In this way, the County Party Committee found out the "bottom line" of the county's unified purchase and sale, became clear-headed, and gained confidence, and thus adopted effective measures and carried out arduous work, quickly correcting the chaotic state of grain unified sale.

This shows that the unified purchase task determined by the state is based on the actual situation in rural areas and is in line with the affordability of farmers. The grain sold by the state in rural areas is sufficient, and in some areas even excessive. If it is properly allocated and the unreasonable sales volume is reduced, the needs of grain-deficient farmers can be met. We must make the broad masses of people in urban and rural areas, especially rural staff, understand this basic situation, so that they are not misled by any false impressions, not shaken by various erroneous arguments, and can use factual evidence to refute those erroneous arguments, and adhere to and implement the grain unified purchase and sale policy confidently and理直气壮. This is the first lesson from rectifying rural grain unified purchase and sale work.

Of course, this does not mean that there are no shortcomings and errors in the rural grain unified purchase and sale work. On the contrary, in some areas, the shortcomings and errors in grain unified purchase and sale are quite serious. The problems in the unified purchase work are mainly manifested in the fact that some farmers have a lot of surplus grain, and the state has not purchased enough; some farmers do not have much surplus grain, but the purchase is "overdone." There are even more problems in the unified sale work: on the one hand, some grain-deficient farmers should have been supplied but were not supplied, or the supply was not timely enough; but on the other hand, a larger amount of deviation is that those who should not have been supplied were supplied, those who should have been supplied less were supplied more, and those who should have been supplied later were supplied earlier. This is what caused the chaos and tension in rural grain work this spring. Farmers said: "Grain unified sale has no regulations." "Last year's unified purchase was better than the year before, and this year's unified sale is more chaotic than last year." This criticism is correct.

These shortcomings and errors are the result of many staff members emphasizing unified purchase in their thinking, and neglecting unified sale, and not combining unified purchase and sale in their work.

In the past two years, rural staff have paid great attention to grain unified purchase, which is completely correct. If the state does not have an adequate amount of grain, it will not be possible to meet the needs of all parties; it would not have been possible to steadily overcome the serious floods like last year while supporting national economic construction and maintaining price stability. However, it must be recognized that we are purchasing grain under the unified system precisely for the purpose of unified sale; if we cannot do a good job in the unified sale work, there is no need for unified purchase. From the perspective of China's current economic conditions, it is not possible to greatly increase grain production in the short term. Therefore, the grain purchased from farmers under the unified system cannot exceed the current limit. But the necessary supplies for the country and the people must be guaranteed. In this case, where is the way out? This is to improve the grain unified purchase work while making every effort to do a good job in the grain unified sale work, resolutely ensuring reasonable needs and resolutely reducing unreasonable demands. Otherwise, if too much is sold here, it will inevitably affect the indispensable needs of other places. If too much is sold everywhere, it will inevitably break through the state's sales plan, either causing chaos in the market or increasing the amount of unified purchase, which is very detrimental to national construction, agricultural production, and farmers' lives.

However, investigating the grain production, consumption, surplus grain, and grain-deficient situations of more than 100 million farm households is a very complex and difficult task. In the past, many regions separated unified purchase and unified sale in their work, which increased the workload and complexity. Every year after the harvest, a great deal of effort and several months were spent on grain unified purchase work; in the spring, even more effort and several months had to be spent on grain unified sale work. In this way, not only did the workload greatly increase, but more importantly, because the time away from the harvest and unified purchase was long, the boundaries between surplus grain and grain-deficient were not easy to draw clearly, the grain sales volume was not easy to control, and the unified sale work often fell into a passive state. According to this lesson, rural grain unified purchase and sale work should be arranged at the same time, and done well once, on the basis of clearly delineating the boundaries between surplus grain and grain-deficient. That is to say, when purchasing grain under the unified system in the autumn, it is necessary to investigate clearly: who has surplus grain, how much is surplus, and immediately determine the amount of unified purchase; who is short of grain, how much is short, and when is it short, and immediately determine the supply quantity and supply time, and supply on time with certificates. The central link in correctly delineating the boundaries between surplus grain and grain-deficient is to accurately verify grain production and completely eliminate the phenomenon of calculating production too high or too low. The amount of grain purchased, retained, and supplied, determined on the basis of reasonable production determination, will not be abnormally light or heavy, or偏紧偏松. This is the second lesson from rectifying rural grain unified sale work.

Grain unified purchase and sale is not only a complex economic work, but also an arduous political work. In the past two years, the education that the Party and the government have conducted among farmers on completing the state's general task during the transition period and obeying the state's plan has been remarkably effective. The broad masses of farmers understand the principle of supporting national economic construction and the benefits of grain unified purchase and sale to the country and farmers, and therefore actively and enthusiastically sell their surplus grain to the state. However, some farmers are able to sell surplus grain when the state makes unified purchases, but then try to buy more grain when the state makes unified sales. This is the main reason for the tense grain sales situation in rural areas this spring and is a manifestation of farmers' inability to fully obey the state plan in thought and action. This shows that political work among farmers must continue to be strengthened, and propaganda and education on obeying the state plan must be carried out more thoroughly. At present, some farmers have such incorrect plans: "Eat the state's grain first, then eat our own"; "Buy more grain from the state and store it for convenience." This should be specifically criticized and corrected. If this method is "convenient" for these farmers, then the state and truly grain-deficient farmers will be extremely inconvenient. Those who seek their own convenience are harming others and benefiting themselves. Is this in line with the morals of the Chinese people? Is this worthy of the country and the grain-deficient farmers? It is also wrong for those who should buy grain later to buy it earlier. Grain-deficient farmers should save and use their own grain first, and then purchase an appropriate amount of grain from the state according to their actual needs. As long as his request is reasonable, the state will guarantee the supply. Therefore, the correct attitude of farmers should be "eat their own first, then eat the state's" under the principle of thrift, which is called obeying the state plan, which is in line with the economic laws of rural areas. In the past two years, the biggest shortcoming in rural grain unified sale work has been that too much grain has been sold after the autumn harvest and before February and March of the following year, far exceeding actual needs. This erroneous practice has fostered the psychology of some farmers to "eat the state's first, then eat their own" and must be resolutely changed. Some farmers think about selling less grain and buying more grain in order to "store grain for drought" to cope with emergencies. This idea is easy to understand, but it is very impractical. The small-scale peasant economy is fragile, and relying on its own strength, it can never resist serious disasters. But if farmers all sell less and buy more, it will be enough to undermine the state's unified purchase and sale policy and weaken the state's power to support farmers in overcoming disasters. Shishan Township, Echeng County, Hubei Province, suffered a serious flood last year, and with the strong help of the state, the disaster was completely overcome. This township has sold a total of 370,000 jin of rice to the state in the past five years (including before the unified purchase), but in the one year from June last year to May this year, the state supplied 1.1 million jin of rice. May I ask, if there were no state unified purchase and sale policy, even if this township stored all the more than 300,000 jin of rice sold to the state, could it have overcome last year's serious disaster? Obviously, it is absolutely impossible. These principles should be repeatedly explained to every household of farmers.

Of course, we must not only continue to strengthen political work, but also determine a set of scientific methods for unified purchase and sale, so that political work is built on the basis of scientific methods, and scientific methods are guaranteed by political work. There are scientific methods, which are the measures of grain "定产、定购、定销" (determining production, purchase, and sale) and various specific methods that have been accumulated in the process of unified purchase and sale in various places. In the future, to carry out grain unified purchase and sale, we must rely on the broad masses of people to concretize the "三定" (three determinations) measures, clarify the boundaries between surplus grain and grain-deficient after repeated deliberation and discussion by the masses, and determine the figures for production, purchase, and sale that conform to the actual situation of each household of farmers, and then resolutely implement them. It is necessary to combine political work with scientific methods. This is the third lesson from rectifying rural grain unified sale work.

The experience of rectifying rural grain unified sale work once again proves that the grain unified purchase and sale policy is beneficial to the country, beneficial to socialist construction and the socialist transformation cause, beneficial to all urban and rural people who buy grain to eat, and beneficial to farmers who sell surplus grain, and is only detrimental to speculative merchants and rich peasant elements. Therefore, all overt or covert arguments that doubt the unified purchase and sale policy are wrong. Our task is to thoroughly criticize these erroneous arguments, vigorously promote achievements, correct shortcomings and errors, and implement this policy even better. We must do this, and we certainly can do it.

    整顿农村粮食统销工作的教训
    全国范围的整顿农村粮食统销工作已经取得巨大的成绩。它的直接成果是控制和压缩了农村中不合理的粮食销售量，使农村粮食统销情况趋于正常。同时，它还提高了农村工作人员和广大农民的觉悟，揭发了农村粮食统购统销工作中的许多问题，给粮食统购统销制度的健全化奠定了基础。其中许多有益的经验教训是我们必须牢记的。
    在整顿农村粮食统销工作以前，华东、中南、华北等地区许多农村中粮食销售状况曾有一度相当紧张。无论在城市和农村中，都有些人说，这是因为“向农民买的多了”，“在农村销的少了”，这些人里面有些是不明真相，人云亦云，有些竟是在淆乱是非，借此攻击政府的统购统销政策，破坏农民群众对政府的信赖。其实，自从实行粮食统购统销以来，国家每年向农民征收的农业税和统购的粮食，不及粮食总产量的三分之一，其中近二分之一又销售到农村中；平均每个农民每年可以有五百多斤粮食，这个数目是够用的，如果使用得当，且能略有盈余。这是我国经济生活中的一个基本的情况。所谓“购的太多”、“销的太少”的论调是没有根据的。
    不调查分析具体事实，听到别人对粮食问题有了一些议论，自己就跟着议论起来，制造吓人的空气，这种不负责任的态度最能坏事，而为了正确地解决粮食问题就必须首先同这种不负责任的态度作斗争。例如，山西定襄县农民在今年春季纷纷向县、区、村各级工作人员反映粮食不够，要求增加供应量。中共县委也被这种假象所迷惑，一度失掉信心，放弃领导，就使全县粮食统销工作陷于混乱状态。后来，县委在上级党委帮助下，先算了一笔大账：一九五四年，定襄县收成不坏，除去国家征收的公粮和统购的粮食，加上国家统销的粮食，全县每人平均有五百六十斤左右的粮食，这个数目是很够用的，缺少粮食的说法是完全错误的。接着，县委又在一些粮食供应最紧张的村庄进行典型调查：定襄县智村乡，一九五四年是丰收年景，全乡共一千一百一十七户，统购粮食十五万六千多斤，平均向每户购了不到一百四十斤；但是由于人为的紧张，今年春季竟给一千零八十户发了供应证，占总户数百分之九十六以上，而且供应粮食三十二万多斤，超过统购量一倍以上！虽然这样，还有许多农民说“没有饭吃”，要求国家继续供应粮食。粮食供应情况的极端不合理，难道还不明显么？县委就这样摸到了全县统购统销的“底”，头脑清醒了，信心提高了，因而采取了有效的措施，进行了艰苦的工作，很快就把粮食统销的混乱状况纠正过来了。
    由此可见，国家确定的统购任务，是从农村的实际情况出发的，是符合农民的负担能力的。国家在农村销售的粮食是很够用的，在某些地区并且是过多了的，如果调配得好，压缩掉不合理的销售量，就能满足缺粮农民的需要。我们一定要使城乡广大人民，特别是农村工作人员，都明白这种基本的情况，使他们不为任何假象所迷惑，不为各种错误论调所动摇，而且能用真凭实据驳倒那些错误论调，心中有数地理直气壮地坚持和贯彻粮食统购统销的政策。这是整顿农村粮食统销工作的第一条教训。
    当然，这绝不是说，在农村粮食统购统销工作中就没有缺点和错误了。恰恰相反，在某些地区，粮食统购统销中的缺点和错误是相当严重的。统购工作中的毛病，主要表现在有些农民余粮很多，国家没有购足；有些农民余粮不多，但购“过头”了。统销工作中的毛病更要多些：一方面是对于某些缺粮农民，应该供应而没有供应，或供应不够及时；但另一方面，更大量的偏向，却是不该供应的供应了，该少供应的多供应了，该迟供应的早供应了。这才造成今年春季农村粮食工作中的混乱和紧张。农民说：“粮食统销没个规程。”“去年统购比前年好，今年统销比去年乱。”这种批评是正确的。
    这些缺点和错误是许多工作人员在思想上重视统购，轻视统销，在工作上没有把统购统销结合起来的结果。
    过去两年，农村工作人员十分重视粮食统购，这是完全正确的。国家如果没有掌握适量的粮食，就不可能满足各方面的需要；就不可能在支援国家经济建设、保持物价稳定的同时，稳稳渡过去年那样严重的水灾。但是，必须认识，我们统购粮食，正是为了统销；如果不能搞好统销工作，也就没有统购的必要了。从我国目前的经济条件看来，在短时期内，还不可能大量增产粮食。因此，向农民统购的粮食，就不可能超过目前的限度。但国家和人民必要的供应却是要保证的。在这种情况下，出路在那里呢？这就是在改进粮食统购工作的同时，全力作好粮食统销工作，对合理的需要坚决保证，对不合理的要求坚决削减下来。否则，如果此地销售过多，势必影响彼地必不可少的需要。如果各地都销售过多，势必突破国家的销售计划，或者使市场陷于混乱，或者增加统购的数量，这对国家建设，对农业生产和农民生活，都是非常不利的。
    但是，把一亿以上的农户的粮食生产、消费和余粮、缺粮的情况调查清楚，是一件非常复杂和困难的事情。过去许多地区在工作中把统购和统销分割开来，更增加了工作的份量和复杂性。每年收获以后，用了很大的力量、几个月的时间进行粮食统购工作；到了春季，又得用更大的力量、几个月的时间进行粮食统销工作。这样，不仅工作份量大大增加，更重要的是由于离开收获和统购的时间久了，余粮、缺粮的界限不容易划清，粮食销量不容易控制，统销工作经常陷于被动状态。根据这个教训，农村粮食统购统销工作应该在划清余粮、缺粮界限的基础上，同时安排，一次作好。这就是说，在秋后统购粮食的时候，就要调查清楚：谁家余粮，余多少，即时确定统购数量；谁家缺粮，缺多少，何时缺，即时确定供应数量和供应时间，凭证按时供应。正确划清余粮、缺粮界限的中心环节是确实核定粮食产量，彻底消除对产量计算偏高偏低的现象。在合理定产的基础上确定的粮食购量、留量和供应量，是不会畸轻畸重、偏紧偏松的。这是整顿农村粮食统销工作的第二条教训。
    粮食统购统销不仅是一项复杂的经济工作，而且是一项艰苦的政治工作。两年以来，党和政府对农民进行的关于完成国家过渡时期总任务和服从国家计划的教育，成效是显著的。广大农民懂得了支援国家经济建设的道理，懂得了粮食统购统销对国家、对农民的好处，因而积极、踊跃地把余粮卖给国家。但是有些农民能够在国家统购时卖出余粮，而在国家统销时却又想法买进更多的粮食。这是今年春季农村粮食销售状况紧张的主要原因，是农民还没有能在思想上和行动上完全服从国家计划的一种表现。这就说明，对农民的政治工作必须继续加强，关于服从国家计划的宣传教育必须作得更透。在目前，一部分农民有这样不正确的打算：“先吃国家的，后吃自己的”；“多向国家买些粮食，储存起来，用着方便”，应该特别加以批判和纠正。如果说，实行这种办法对这些农民是“方便”的，那末国家和真正缺粮的农民就要极端不方便了，图自己方便的人就是损人利己了。这难道合乎我国人民的道德吗？这难道对得起国家和缺粮的农民吗？应该迟买而早买粮食的人也是不对的。缺粮的农民应该省吃俭用，首先消费自己的粮食，然后按照实际的需要，向国家购买适量的粮食。只要他的要求合情合理，国家是会保证供应的。所以，农民的正确态度应该是在节约的原则下
  “先吃自己的，后吃国家的”，这才叫作服从国家计划，这才符合农村的经济规律。过去两年，农村粮食统销工作中最大的缺点是在每年秋收以后，到来年二、三月前，销售粮食过多，远远超过了实际的需要。这种错误的作法助长了某些农民“先吃国家的，后吃自己的”的心理，必须坚决加以改变。有些农民想着少卖些粮食，多买些粮食，是为了“储粮备荒”，应付急用。这种想法是容易理解的，但这是很不实际的。小农经济是脆弱的，依靠它自己的力量，绝不能抵御严重的灾荒。但农民如果都来少卖多买，却足以破坏国家的统购统销政策，削弱国家支持农民战胜灾荒的力量。湖北省鄂城县石山乡去年遭受了严重的水灾，在国家大力帮助之下，把灾荒完全战胜了。这个乡五年来共计卖给国家三十七万斤稻谷（包括统购以前），但从去年六月到今年五月的一年之中，国家就供应了一百一十万斤大米。试问，如果没有国家的统购统销政策，这个乡即使把卖给国家的三十多万斤稻谷都储存起来，难道能够渡过去年的严重灾荒吗？显然是绝不可能的。这些道理应该反复向家家户户农民讲清楚。
    当然，我们不仅要继续加强政治工作，而且要确定一套关于统购统销的科学方法，使政治工作建筑在科学方法的基础上，使科学方法获得政治工作的保证。科学方法是有的，这就是粮食“定产、定购、定销”的措施以及各地在统购统销过程中积累起来的行之有效的各种具体办法。今后进行粮食统购统销，必须依靠广大群众把“三定”措施具体化，经过群众反复酝酿讨论，一次划清余粮、缺粮的界限，确定符合各户农民的实际状况的产、购、销的数字，然后坚定不移地加以贯彻。必须使政治工作同科学方法相结合，这就是整顿农村粮食统销工作的第三条教训。
    整顿农村粮食统销工作的经验再一次证明了粮食统购统销政策对国家有利，对社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业有利，对所有买粮食吃的城乡人民有利，对出卖余粮的农民有利，只是对投机奸商和富农分子不利。因此，一切或明或暗的怀疑统购统销政策的论调都是错误的。我们的任务是彻底批判这些错误的论调，努力发扬成绩，纠正缺点和错误，把这个政策贯彻得更好。我们一定要这样做，我们一定可以做到。
