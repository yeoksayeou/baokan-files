Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 4th. According to the "Neues Deutschland" report: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held its twenty-fourth plenary session on the 1st and 2nd, discussing issues related to the restoration of German unification and strengthening the German Democratic Republic as a bulwark for security and peace. Twenty-three Central Committee members spoke during the discussion. The communiqué issued by the meeting pointed out: The new situation presents new tasks for the German working class and all patriotic people.

The communiqué quoted the report made by the First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, Ulbricht, at the meeting.

Ulbricht pointed out in his report that after the ratification of the Paris Agreements, conditions must be created within Germany itself to enable the four countries to reach an understanding on the peaceful resolution of the German question. Therefore, the rapprochement between the two parts of Germany is extremely necessary at present. Ulbricht put forward ten suggestions for rapprochement between East and West Germany: (1) Demand that all countries reach an understanding on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; (2) Stop the propaganda of war and racial hatred in newspapers, literary publications, radio, and schools; (3) Normalize the situation in Berlin, close down the espionage agencies in West Berlin, ban the fascist "Bear Division" in West Berlin, and the activities of veterans' associations of Hitler's army; (4) Promote German unification into a democratic country. To this end, it is necessary to demand the withdrawal of occupying forces, the dismantling of military bases, and the conclusion of a peace treaty, guaranteeing that Germany does not participate in any alliance. German territory will be guaranteed by a collective security treaty; (5) Normalize the economic relations between West Germany and the German Democratic Republic; (6) Purge the fascist war criminals, especially SS personnel, from the state organs and police organs of West Germany; (7) Promote cooperation and exchange delegations between factory workers, trade union workers, women's and youth organizations in West Germany and the German Democratic Republic; (8) Promote cooperation between youth organizations to further realize the basic rights of young people as stipulated in the resolutions of the All-German Youth Congress. Restore the freedom of activity of the Free German Youth League in West Germany; (9) Promote cooperation between sports organizations to promote sports exchanges throughout Germany; (10) Promote cooperation between scientific and cultural research institutions and literary and art organizations to protect the humanitarian cultural traditions of Germany and the development of German culture.

Ulbricht called on all peace-loving and democratic forces in Germany to unite and launch a massive people's movement on this basis.
