    Combine Harvesters in the Wheat Fields
    Ji Zhuoru

    The wheat is ripe, and the green fields are tinged with gold. Fourteen combine harvesters from the Hubei Province No. 53 Mechanical Farm have begun harvesting in the 40,000-plus mu of wheat fields.

    The farm's wheat suffered a major flood in 1954, with an average yield of only 70 to 80 jin per mu. This year, there was no flood, and with improved cultivation techniques and the selection of superior varieties, it is estimated that the average wheat yield per mu will reach 130 to 150 jin, with the highest yield reaching 200 jin. The workers are all delighted with this year's good wheat harvest.

    Before dawn, young harvester operators Zhou Zhenguo, Wu Yawu, and others had polished their harvesters until they gleamed, and even tied a large flower ball to the dashboard. As soon as the sun rose, the harvester operators started their engines and drove towards the seemingly endless wheat fields. The roaring sound of the combine harvesters mingled with the laughter of the people, making the entire peaceful wilderness suddenly lively. From afar, the silver-gray Stalin No. 6 combine harvesters looked like huge ships, sailing majestically in the golden sea of wheat; while the Stalin No. 4 combine harvesters, small and exquisite, were like maroon steeds, galloping across the vast wilderness.

    The harvester operators know that in 1954, the wheat harvest was plagued by rain, and the ground was muddy, preventing the combine harvesters from playing their part. Some of the wheat could not be harvested in time and was ruined by the rain. This year, everyone is seizing the clear weather to rush the harvest. Every day, as night falls, the harvester operators continue to drive their combine harvesters, working in the sea of wheat. They are seizing every opportunity to complete the original task of harvesting 41,000 mu in eighteen days ahead of schedule.

    联合收割机在麦田里
    纪卓如
    小麦已经成熟，碧绿的田野染上了一片金黄。湖北省五三机械农场的十四台联合收割机在四万多亩麦田里开始紧张地收割。
    农场的小麦一九五四年遭了大水灾，每亩产量平均只有七、八十斤，今年没有水灾，加以改进耕作技术和选种优良品种，估计每亩小麦平均产量达一百三十斤至一百五十斤，最高产量可达二百斤。职工们都为着今年小麦收成好而欢欣鼓舞。
    天亮以前，年轻的收割机手周振国，吴亚武等就把收割机擦得油光明滑的，在驾驶台上还扎了
  一朵大花球。太阳刚刚升起，收割机手们发动了机车，向着一眼望不到边的麦田驶去。联合收割机轰隆隆的音响和人们的欢笑声音交织在一起，使整个宁静的原野顿时热闹起来。远远望去，银灰色的斯大林六号联合收割机像一艘一艘巨大的舰艇，在金黄色的麦海里威武地航行；而斯大林四号联合收割机，小巧玲珑，像枣红色的骏马，在广阔的原野上飞跑。
    收割机手们知道，一九五四年麦收下雨，地上泥泞，联合收割机没有发挥作用，有的小麦来不及收割，给雨淋坏了。今年大家都趁着晴朗天气紧张地抢收。每天，夜幕笼罩着大地，收割机手们还在继续驶着联合收割机在麦海里劳作。他们抓紧一切时间，争取提前完成原规定十八天割完四万一千亩的任务。
