    Shandong Province has achieved remarkable results this year in both state-funded flood control and drainage projects and mass-led farmland irrigation construction.
    By June 15th, the flood control and drainage projects among the 231 state-funded water conservancy projects had been basically completed. The completed projects can protect more than 2.2 million mu of farmland from floods and waterlogging. Among them, the Weiyun River, which flows through the Liaocheng and Dezhou regions, after renovation and the construction of diversion projects, will protect one million mu of farmland from the threat of floods, and will also safeguard the safety of some Jinpu and Deshi railway transportation and many towns and villages.
    Small-scale farmland irrigation projects have been carried out extensively with the development of the drought resistance campaign. According to incomplete statistics, more than 64,000 new wells have been dug throughout the province, exceeding this year's well-digging plan; more than 25,000 old wells have been repaired, and more than 14,900 waterwheels have been promoted and sold. In addition, more than 6,690 places have been used to divert mountain springs, build dams to intercept rivers, repair canals, and build reservoirs. These projects have fully demonstrated their effectiveness in the drought resistance campaign. Together with the original water conservancy conditions, they have enabled more than 5.8 million mu of wheat to be irrigated and more than 2.27 million mu of spring fields to be planted with water. It has added favorable conditions for future drought prevention and resistance work. (Supplied)

    山东省农田水利工程成绩显著
    山东省今年由国家投资举办的防洪排涝工程和群众性的农田水利建设，都已获得了显著成绩。
    到六月十五日前，国家投资举办的二百三十一项水利工程中，防洪排涝工程已基本完成。已建成的工程，可使二百二十多万亩农田免于洪涝灾害。其中流经聊城、德州专区的卫运河，经过修整和建成分洪工程后，将有一百万亩农田不再受洪水威胁，而且保卫了部分的津浦、德石铁路交通和许多城镇、乡村的安全。
    小型农田水利工程，随着抗旱运动的开展，进行得十分广泛。据目前不完全的统计，全省已打新井六万四千多眼，超过了今年的打井计划；并修旧井二万五千多眼，推销水车一万四千九百多部。另外，引山泉、拦河打坝、修渠和蓄水池等达六千六百九十多处。这些工程在抗旱运动中已充分发挥了效能，连同原有的水利条件，使五百八十多万亩小麦获得灌溉，还水种了二百二十七万多亩春田。对今后的防旱抗旱工作更增添了有利条件。（供）
