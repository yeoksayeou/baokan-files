　　Practice Thrift, Calculate Carefully, Oppose Waste
　　After the Project Ends, Sort Out the Materials on Site

　　Editor:

　　Recently, under the leadership of the Zhengzhou Power Plant Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the employees of the state-owned Zhengzhou Power Plant used their spare time to carry out a search for scrap steel and wood. The Zhengzhou Power Plant is not a factory producing steel or wood. Where did the steel and wood for collection come from? It turns out that when the plant began construction in 1953, the staff responsible for capital construction took an irresponsible attitude towards state assets, throwing away a lot of useful steel and wood everywhere. After the completion of the project, no one cared about this batch of discarded materials. Since the central government called for practicing thrift and opposing waste, the workers felt uneasy when they saw these scattered materials. Therefore, when the factory's Party committee mobilized the collection of building materials, all the workers in the factory participated in this work. In two days, they collected a total of 25,238 catties of scrap steel, 35,716 catties of wood and lumber, 450 catties of broken glass, and more than 3,500 bricks. Among these materials are new safety helmets, seamless steel pipes, pipe bending machines, and many fir poles, all of which are useful materials for capital construction. I hope that after the completion of various construction projects, the materials on the site will be carefully sorted out in a responsible manner, and that state materials will not be wasted.　Pong Mingxun

　　The Scraps of Soybean Cake Edges Can Still Be Pressed for Oil

　　Editor:

　　Because the edges of the soybean cakes easily shed scraps during transportation, the Linkou Urban Oil Mill in Heilongjiang Province implemented a method of trimming the edges of the soybean cakes in mid-May. When the workers trimmed the edges, they found that the trimmed soybean cake edges still contained a portion of oil. This is because the pressure on the edge of the oil press is small, and the oil in the cake edge cannot be completely squeezed out. After studying this situation, the leadership approved the workers' suggestion to put the shaved soybean cake edge residue on the kang to bake for ten minutes and then put it on the press. As a result, more than eight catties of oil were squeezed out of every 100 catties of soybean cake edge residue, and the quality was also very good. The factory's annual soybean cake production is more than 150,000 pieces. Calculating based on each soybean cake shaving off five taels of edge residue and each 100 catties of soybean cake edge residue yielding eight catties of oil, more than 6,000 catties of soybean oil can be squeezed out annually.

　　Using Waste Materials to Manufacture Wrapping Paper

　　Editor:

　　Baoji Paper Mill of Shaanxi Provincial Joint State-Private New Qin Enterprise Co., Ltd. has achieved results in using waste materials to manufacture wrapping paper.

　　One of the main raw materials for Baoji Paper Mill to manufacture high-quality paper such as daolin paper, typewriter paper, and newsprint is the waste cotton from textile mills. In the past, after the waste cotton was cleaned by the flower beating machine, the remaining residue was burned as waste fuel. In fact, there are still usable fiber components in it. At the beginning of this year, the workers conducted research and experiments and finally came up with a method to re-clean these residues and use the effective fiber components to manufacture wrapping paper. In February alone, they used this past waste material to manufacture more than two tons of wrapping paper in one go, saving the country 258 yuan. The workers are determined to continue to study conservation methods in the future and further achieve the goal of making the best use of everything.

　　Use a Hook Tool to Remove the Lead Wire on Wooden Bale Wraps

　　Editor:

　　At present, most yarn factories and cotton bale conversion units in the country simply chop off the lead wire on the wooden bale wraps when unpacking. Starting in March of this year, our Dezhou Branch of the Shandong Provincial Cotton Yarn & Fabrics Company decided to use hook tools to remove the lead wire instead. This not only reduces the waste of broken lead wire ends, but also simplifies the recycling procedures because re-twisting is no longer needed. The packaging plant unpacks more than 1,200 bales every day. Originally, three workers were used to chop off the lead wire. Although unpacking requires ten workers after switching to hook tools, the labor saved during recycling is much greater than this. Moreover, the 1,800 catties of lead wire removed each day are worth more than 200 yuan compared to the chopped-off waste lead wire. This matter may seem small, but if our processing plant implements it, it can save tens of thousands of yuan a year. If it is widely promoted in various places (Editor's note: According to the China Cotton Yarn & Fabrics Company, at present, except for the state-owned Beijing First and Second Cotton Textile Factories, yarn factories in Shaanxi Province, and Xiangtan Yarn Factory in Hunan, most yarn factories and bale conversion units still use the method of chopping off lead wire to unpack), the saved amount will be considerable.

    厉行节约必须精打细算反对浪费
    工程结束后要整理现场物资编辑同志：
    最近，国营郑州电厂的职工在中共郑州电厂党委会领导下，利用业余时间进行了一次搜集废钢铁和木料的工作。郑州电厂不是钢铁、木材的生产工厂，哪里来的钢铁和木料可以收集呢？原来在一九五三年开始建厂的时候，负责基本建设的工作人员对国家资财采取了不负责任的态度，把好多有用的钢铁、木材到处乱扔，工程完工以后，这批被遗弃的材料也就无人过问了。自从中央号召厉行节约、反对浪费以后，职工们看到这批散乱的材料，都感到不安。所以，当工厂党委动员搜集建筑材料的时候，全厂职工纷纷参加这个工作。他们在两天内，共搜集到废钢铁二万五千二百三十八斤，木材、木料三万五千七百一十六斤，碎玻璃四百五十斤，砖三千五百多块。这些材料中有新的安全帽、无缝钢管、弯管机，还有好多杉木杆，都是基本建设中有用的材料。我希望各建筑工程完工以后，认真负责地整理一下现场材料，不要浪费国家物资。　庞明勋
    豆饼边的渣子还可以榨油编辑同志：
    由于毛边的豆饼在运输时容易掉下碎渣，黑龙江林口城区制油厂在五月中旬实行了将豆饼削边的办法。工人们在削边时，发现削下来的豆饼边里还含有一部分油量。这是因为油榨边沿的压力较小，不能将饼边油量全部榨出。领导上研究了这个情况，就批准了工人的建议，将削下来的豆饼边渣子放到炕上烘十分钟再上榨，结果每百斤豆饼边渣子又榨出了八斤多油，而且质量还很好。这个厂全年豆饼生产量在十五万块以上，按每块豆饼削下五两边渣子，每百斤豆饼边渣子榨八斤油计算，一年可多榨豆油六千多斤。

    利用废料制造包皮纸编辑同志：
    陕西省公私合营新秦企业有限公司宝鸡造纸厂利用废料制造包皮纸，已经获得了成绩。
    宝鸡造纸厂制造道林纸、打字纸、新闻纸等高级纸张的主要原料之一，是纺织厂的下脚花。过去下脚花经过打花机清理后，剩下的渣滓都被当作废料烧了炉子；实际上这里面还有可用的纤维成份。今年年初，职工们进行了研究和试验，终于想出办法，把这些渣滓重新清理，用其中有效的纤维成份制造包皮纸。只在二月份，一次就利用这种过去的废料制造出二吨多包皮纸，为国家节约二百五十八元。职工们决心在今后继续研究节约办法，更进一步地做到物尽其用。

    用钩子工具拆木机包上的铅丝编辑同志：
    现在全国大部分地区的纱厂和花衣改包单位，在拆包时对木机包上的铅丝都是一刀剁断了事。今年三月份起，我们山东省花纱布公司德州分公司打包厂决定改用钩子工具拆铅丝。这样不但可以减少铅丝断头浪费；而且回用时不要再经扭接，大大简化了回用手续。打包厂每天拆包一千二百多包，原来用三个工人剁铅丝。改用钩子工具拆铅丝后，虽然拆包需要十个工人了，但是回用时所省的人工要比这多得多；而且每天拆下的一千八百斤铅丝就比剁断的废铅丝多值二百多元。这件事情看起来似乎很小，但我们加工厂实行以后一年就可以节约好几万元；如果在各地普遍推行（编者按：据中国花纱布公司了解，目前除国营北京第一、第二棉纺织厂，陕西省各纱厂和湖南湘潭纱厂等单位外，大部分地区的纱厂和改包单位还沿用剁断铅丝拆包的办法），节约的数字就很可观了。
