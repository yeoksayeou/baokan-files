    Reported by our newspaper: After the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association made five resolutions on the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary group on May 25th, literary and art organizations in various provinces and cities across the country, branches of the Writers Association, and other literary and art groups sent telegrams and letters to the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers Association, warmly supporting and endorsing the five resolutions. These included the literary federations of Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Anhui, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shanxi provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; the literary federations of Beijing, Changchun, Benxi, Jinzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan cities; the Wuhan and Xi'an branches of the Chinese Writers Association, the Xi'an branch of the Chinese Artists Association, and the Xi'an branch of the Chinese Musicians Association. There were also all the staff of the Central Conservatory of Music and its juvenile class, the second team of the China Acrobatic Troupe, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, the choral conducting study class of the Central Song and Dance Troupe, the Jilin Provincial Song and Dance Troupe, the Jilin Provincial Drama Troupe, and the Changchun Film Studio; in addition, there were letters and telegrams from some school literature departments, film screening units, and individuals. Everyone unanimously supported the resolutions of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and expressed great anger at the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. It was unanimously believed that: Hu Feng is a vicious enemy of the Chinese people. For twenty years, he hid in the revolutionary ranks, undermining the revolutionary cause, undermining the revolutionary literary and art movement, undermining the unity of literary and art workers, organizing his group, and launching vicious attacks on the Party and the people, attempting to overthrow the people's regime and restore reactionary forces in China. This is something the Chinese people will never allow. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a major victory for the revolutionary cause. Everyone unanimously demanded: In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, revoke Hu Feng's qualifications as a representative to the National People's Congress, remove Hu Feng, this vermin among the people, from the revolutionary ranks, and demand a thorough investigation of all the criminal activities of the Hu Feng group and its political background.
