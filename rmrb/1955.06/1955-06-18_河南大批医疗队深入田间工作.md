Henan Province's Linxian, Nanle, Bo'ai, Wuzhi, Qinyang, Luoning, Ye County, Lushan, Gongxian, Qi County, the suburbs of Kaifeng City, and the Shangqiu area's Minquan, Luyi, Yongcheng, Dancheng, Shenqiu, and Xiangcheng, among other places, have sent large numbers of medical teams to the countryside, and they have begun to be active in the wheat harvesting fields. Among them, 114 doctors from three districts of Dancheng County participated in the medical teams. Medical personnel from the second and third districts of Lushan County not only go deep into the fields to carry out medical activities, but also use farmers' rest time to publicize summer health knowledge to farmers. Recently, the Lushan Second District Health Center also established a medical station in Houliangou Township in the mountainous area to be responsible for medical work during the wheat harvest in nearby townships. The Chengguan Town Health Center in Qi County trained ten first-aid workers for five agricultural cooperatives. These first-aid workers reaped wheat while carrying first-aid kits to carry out simple medical work.

    河南大批医疗队深入田间工作
    河南省林县、南乐、博爱、武陟、沁阳、洛宁、叶县、鲁山、巩县、杞县、开封市郊和商邱专区的民权、鹿邑、永城、郸城、沈邱、项城等地大批医疗队都已下乡并开始活跃在麦收的田野上。其中郸城县三个区就有一百一十四名医生参加了医疗队。鲁山县二、三两区的医务人员一面深入田间进行医疗活动，一面利用农民休息时间向农民宣传夏季卫生常识。鲁山二区卫生所最近并在山区的后连沟乡建立一个医疗站，负责附近几个乡麦收中的医疗工作。杞县城关镇卫生所为五个农业合作社训练了十名急救员，这些急救员一面收割小麦，一面背上急救袋进行简易的医疗工作。
