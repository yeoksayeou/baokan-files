The forty-two rural grain markets in the agricultural region of Qinghai Province have, in conjunction with the rectification of rural grain unified sales work, mostly become active. According to incomplete statistics, the total amount of grain put on the market from April 1 to May 15 reached more than 4 million jin, of which farmers' mutual adjustment of grain accounted for about 30%. As a result, the amount of grain sold by the state in the agricultural region in April this year decreased by 14% compared with the same period in 1954, and the amount purchased increased by 15% compared with the same period in 1954. This not only enriched the inventory strength but also facilitated farmers to adjust surpluses and deficiencies and exchange varieties through the market, solving difficulties in production and life.

    青海农业区粮食市场活跃
    青海省农业区四十二个农村粮食市场，结合整顿农村粮食统销工作，大部分已经活跃起来了。据不完全统计，自四月一日至五月十五日上市粮食总数约达四百多万斤，其中农民互相调剂的粮食占百分之三十左右。因此，今年四月份国家在农业区销售粮食的数量较一九五四年同时期减少了百分之十四，收购数量也较一九五四年同时期增加了百分之十五。这不仅充实了库存力量，而且也便利了农民通过市场调剂余缺及进行品种互换，解决了生产生活上的困难。
