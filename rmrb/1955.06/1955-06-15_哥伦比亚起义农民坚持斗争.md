Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 13th: According to TASS, Colombian uprising farmers continue to fight stubbornly against government troops. In order to oppose the government's decision to confiscate farmers' land to build military buildings, the farmers are taking up arms to defend their land rights.

According to the Chilean newspaper "El Siglo," the Colombian government has adopted cruel persecution measures against the uprising farmers. The government has declared the eastern region of Tolima Province, with a population of about 100,000, a "military operations zone" and sent a large number of military troops to the region. The government ordered all residents of Villarrica (including 3,000 children) to move to other areas. The government arrested many farmers and killed some of those arrested.

However, these terrorist measures have failed to subdue the uprising farmers. The farmers continue to resolutely resist the attacks of government troops equipped with tanks, artillery, and aircraft. According to the Colombian newspaper "El Tiempo," government troops suffered thirty-one deaths and sixty-three injuries in armed conflicts with the uprising farmers.

    哥伦比亚起义农民坚持斗争
    新华社十三日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚消息：哥伦比亚起义农民继续顽强地同政府军队进行斗争。为了反对政府决定没收农民土地来建筑军事建筑物，农民们拿着武器捍卫自己的土地权。
    据智利“世纪报”报道，哥伦比亚政府对起义农民采取了残酷的迫害措施。政府把约有十万居民的托里马省东部地区宣布为“军事行动区”，把大批军事部队派到这个地区去。政府命令维里亚里卡的所有居民（包括三千名儿童）迁往其他地区。政府逮捕了许多农民，并且杀死了一部分被逮捕的农民。
    但是，这些恐怖措施并没有能使起义农民屈服。农民们继续坚决抵抗装备着坦克、大炮和飞机的政府军队的进攻。据哥伦比亚“时代报”报道，政府军队在同起义农民的武装冲突中有三十一名死亡，六十三名受伤。
