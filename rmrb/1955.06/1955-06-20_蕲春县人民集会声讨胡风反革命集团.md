Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th: On the evening of June 17th, people from all walks of life in Qichun County, Hubei Province, held a rally to condemn the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements. Farmers from Shaolong Township and Xiashitan Township in the second district of Qichun County, where Hu Feng's family is located, also sent representatives to participate in the meeting. Those present at the meeting demanded with unparalleled anger that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique be severely punished according to law, and that all hidden counter-revolutionary elements be resolutely purged.

Chen Qinghua and Fang Tanfa, farmers from Xiashitan Township and Shaolong Township, accused Hu Feng at the meeting of consistently supporting and shielding the landlord family and attacking the peasants before and after liberation. Before liberation, Hu Feng consistently supported his elder brother, the local tyrant landlord Zhang Mingshan, in running rampant in the countryside and oppressing the peasants. In 1951, during the land reform in the area, Hu Feng wrote a letter instructing his fourth younger brother, Zhang Xueren, a counter-revolutionary element who had served as a pseudo-joint guarantor, killed peasants, and raped countless women, to resist the liquidation by the farmers' association. In the spring of 1952, during the land reform review movement, Hu Feng again wrote a letter instructing his second elder brother to attack the farmers' association and deny that his family was classified as landlords. Worker Xia Faqing also spoke at the meeting, demanding that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique be severely punished.

In the end, those present at the meeting unanimously agreed to write a letter to the newspaper, requesting the government to severely punish the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique according to law, and expressed their determination to turn their anger into strength, strengthen political study, raise revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements to defend the socialist construction of the motherland.

    蕲春县人民集会声讨胡风反革命集团
    新华社武汉十九日电　六月十七日晚湖北省蕲春县各界人民举行声讨胡风反革命分子大会。胡风家庭所在的蕲春县第二区邵垅乡和下石潭乡的农民也派代表参加了大会。到会的人以无比愤怒的心情要求依法严惩胡风反革命集团，并坚决肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    下石潭乡和邵垅乡的农民陈庆华、方坦发在大会上控诉了胡风在解放前后一贯支持包庇地主家庭，向农民进攻的罪行。解放前，胡风一贯支持他的大哥恶霸地主张名山，横行乡里，压榨农民。一九五一年当地土地改革时，胡风写信指使他的四弟、曾经当过伪联保主任、杀死过农民、强奸过无数妇女的反革命分子张学仁，抗拒农会的清算。一九五二年春，开展土地改革复查运动时，胡风又写信指使他的二哥向农会进攻，不承认他家被划为地主成份。工人夏发庆，也在会上讲话，要求严办胡风反革命集团。
    最后，到会的人一致同意写信给报社，要求政府依法严惩胡风反革命集团，并表示要把愤怒变成力量，加强政治学习，提高革命警惕性，把一切暗藏的反革命分子坚决清除出去，保卫祖国的社会主义建设事业。
