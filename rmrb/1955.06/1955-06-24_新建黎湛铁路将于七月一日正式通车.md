The newly built Li-Zhan Railway, running from Litang in Guangxi to Zhanjiang on the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong, has been completed and will officially open to traffic on July 1st. The completion of this railway provides favorable conditions for consolidating our national defense, liberating Taiwan, and boosting our foreign trade.

The Li-Zhan Railway was decided to be built by the Ministry of Railways of the People's Republic of China in August 1954, with the scheduled opening to traffic by the end of 1955. This railway was constructed by the shock force of the motherland's railway construction – the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Thanks to the timely and sufficient supply of construction materials by the state, the active support of the people of Guangdong and Guangxi, the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the active efforts of engineering personnel in design and construction, and the selfless labor of the Railway Corps construction troops, this railway was opened to traffic six months ahead of schedule. On May 19th, the two track-laying teams, one advancing south from Litang and the other advancing north from Zhanjiang, connected the tracks six kilometers south of Lianjiang County in Guangdong. The Yujiang Bridge, the most important key project of the entire line, was also completed in early June. Currently, the remaining portion of stations and other facilities are being built at an accelerated pace.

The main line of the Li-Zhan Railway is 314.578 kilometers long, with an additional 50 kilometers of dedicated lines, branch lines, and station tracks. The Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army mobilized its troops in August 1954 and, after more than a month of preparation, began construction in October. During the construction period, the Railway Corps troops and the broad masses of civilian laborers carried forward their patriotic labor enthusiasm, universally launched labor competitions, and greatly improved construction efficiency. Zhang Hongzhi, the detachment leader of a certain unit, and engineer Wu Zhiping, while constructing the Yujiang Bridge, guided the troops to quickly improve the operational skills of various types of workers, enabling the bridge to be completed ahead of schedule. This unit also used pneumatic caissons for the first time to build the underwater foundation of the Yujiang Bridge and trained a group of excellent caisson workers. Zhou Shaorong, a soldier from a certain company, created the "sliding bricklaying parallel method" in the arch bricklaying work of culverts, bringing the construction efficiency to eight and a half times the quota. The 14th squad of a certain company achieved an average of 9.4 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day. The rationalization proposals put forward by engineers Qu Zhang and Ren Enhai saved the state approximately 500,000 yuan in transportation costs during the track-laying project. Zhang Hualong, a civilian laborer, created the "T-shaped hook hanging basket soil dumping method," and after its promotion, the efficiency of earthwork projects generally increased by 30% to 50%. In order to overcome the threat of this year's rainy season, the construction troops and the broad masses of civilian laborers continuously and intensively worked for a month and a half, and basically completed the earthwork and stonework projects and the bridge and culvert foundation projects of the entire line by the end of March. Led by Chen Guifa, a railway employee and national railway labor model, the bridge-erecting team created a record of erecting four-hole beams in 11 hours and 40 minutes. The track-laying troops created a record of manually laying 6,616 meters of track in a single day and completed the entire line's track-laying task one month ahead of schedule according to the plan.

    新建黎湛铁路将于七月一日正式通车
    从广西黎塘到广东雷州半岛湛江的黎湛铁路已经建筑完工，将于七月一日正式通车。这一条铁路的建成，对巩固我国国防、解放台湾和活跃我国对外贸易提供了有利的条件。
    黎湛铁路是中华人民共和国铁道部在一九五四年八月决定建筑的，预定一九五五年年底通车。这一条铁路由祖国铁道建设的突击队——中国人民解放军铁道兵担任施工。由于国家及时和充分地供应了建筑资材，两广人民的积极支援和苏联专家热忱帮助，以及设计、施工方面工程人员的积极努力和铁道兵施工部队的忘我劳动，使这一条铁路提前六个月通车。五月十九日，由黎塘南向和从湛江北向的两支铺轨队在广东廉江县南六公里处接轨。全线最重要的关键工程郁江大桥也在六月上旬完工。现在，剩余的一部分车站和其他设备正在加紧建筑中。
    黎湛铁路正线全长三百一十四点五七八公里，另有专线、便线、站线五十公里。中国人民解放军铁道兵在一九五四年八月调动部队，经过一个多月的准备后，在十月份开始动工。筑路期间，担任施工的铁道兵部队和广大民工发扬了爱国主义的劳动热情，普遍展开劳动竞赛，大大提高了施工效率。某支队支队长张鸿智和工程师吴秩平在建筑郁江大桥时，指导部队迅速提高了各工种的作业技能，使大桥提前完工。这支部队还首次使用气压沉箱修建郁江大桥的水下基础，并且培养了一批优秀的沉箱手。某连战士周绍荣在砌涵渠拱砖工作中创造了“滑动砌砖并列法”，使施工效率达到定额的八倍半。某连十四班创造了平均每人每天完成土方工程九点四公方的成绩。某部工程师屈张、任恩海提的合理化建议，使国家在铺轨工程中节约了运输费约五十万元。民工张华隆创造的“丁字钩挂箕倒土法”推广后，土方工程的效率普遍提高了百分之三十到五十。为了战胜今年雨季的威胁，施工部队和广大民工连续紧张地突击了一个半月，在三月底基本完成了全线的土石方工程和桥涵基础工程。架桥队在铁路员工、全国铁路劳动模范陈贵发的带领下创造了十一小时四十分钟架四孔梁的纪录，铺轨部队创造了人工铺轨日进六公里六百一十六公尺的纪录，并按计划提前一个月完成了全线铺轨任务。　（新华社）
