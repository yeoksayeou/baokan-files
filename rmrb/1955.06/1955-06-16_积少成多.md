    Little Accumulates into Much

    The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative is responsible for the recovery of scrap metal throughout Beijing. From October 1952 to June 10 of this year, it has recovered more than 4,240 tons of various scrap metals such as copper, steel, iron, lead, tin, and aluminum, worth more than 2.5 million yuan. Last year, it supplied nearly 500 tons of scrap steel to steel and iron factories. In May of this year alone, it supplied more than 600 tons of scrap steel to Tianjin Steel Plant, and in the first ten days of June, it supplied another 200 tons. Last year and this year, it supplied more than 1,500 tons of scrap steel to the Beijing Handicraft Industry Federation, accounting for half of the total steel used by the city's handicraft cooperatives. The handicraft cooperatives have produced a large number of daily necessities such as pots, kitchen knives, and rice spoons with good quality and low prices to supply the market. Several hundred tons of scrap steel transported from Beijing by supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong, Hebei and other places have also been made into new-style farm tools.
    Recovering scrap metal is a difficult but very important task. Recovering scrap metal requires the ability to distinguish the properties and quality of scrap metal, to do complicated sorting and organizing work, to diligently promote and run errands, and to manage the scrap metal well to avoid stockpiling and wasting state funds. Some people who started doing this work felt it was hard and dirty. However, when they learned that steelworkers could not make steel without scrap steel, when they saw that even garbage-like copper ash could be processed into shiny copper blocks, and that recovering scrap metal was also an indispensable part of socialist construction, they actively overcame difficulties and worked diligently.
    Various locomotive depots in the railway department produce a waste material—copper-lead alloy filings—during the production process. According to people from Fengtai Locomotive Depot, this waste material could neither be returned to the furnace nor sold, so it had to be wasted. After hearing about this, the staff of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, who are responsible for purchasing scrap metal, rushed to Fengtai Locomotive Depot to conduct performance tests. After three experiments, it was proven that 50% of miscellaneous lead and 30% of brass could be extracted from these filings. The cooperative then started purchasing them, collecting more than ten tons last year. Since then, not only Fengtai Locomotive Depot, but also Baoding and Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depots, have found a way to dispose of copper-lead alloy filings.
    The Changxindian Rolling Stock Plant produces 15 to 20 tons of copper furnace ash every month, which used to be discarded, but since March of last year, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has been recovering it all. In order to find the copper furnace ash that had been abandoned for a long time, the comrades who purchased scrap metal went to the factory three times to inquire and ask the nearby residents. Now, everyone is certain that there are hundreds to thousands of tons of copper furnace ash buried inside and outside the factory. If there are 1,000 tons of copper furnace ash, about 100 jin of miscellaneous copper can be extracted, which is a considerable figure.
    Since factories and enterprises in Beijing launched the anti-waste campaign and youth conservation teams were established one after another, many metals that used to be treated as waste materials are now being recovered and utilized by the factories themselves. Since April, the monthly amount of scrap metal recovered has increased by an average of two times compared to the months in the first quarter. The number of purchasing stations of the supply and marketing cooperative has increased from more than 130 to more than 200.
    Approximately 30% of the recovered scrap metal comes from residents' homes. Since the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative started purchasing scrap metal from the people last June, many residents in urban and suburban areas have automatically sold scrap copper and iron to the state. The Xuanwu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, because its staff conscientiously publicized the importance of scrap copper and iron to national construction, did not mind the trouble, and took measures to facilitate the sale by the masses everywhere, purchased 3,500 jin of copper from street residents in the first quarter of this year, and another 3,200 jin in April and May. However, some district cooperatives only collected 30 to 50 jin of copper, and the work in some districts has not been carried out for a long time. Some of them said: "Scrap copper and iron were collected during the Anti-Japanese War, and there is none left now." Others complained that it was too troublesome for the masses to sell three or five liang at a time, and therefore used the excuse of not having time to not carry out the purchasing work. These district cooperatives must correct their erroneous understanding and purchase more scrap metal to sell to the state!

    北京市供销合作总社担负着全北京市的废金属回收任务。从一九五二年十月起，到今年六月十日，已回收铜、钢、铁、铅、锡、铝等各种废金属四千二百四十多吨，价值二百五十多万元。去年已供给了钢厂、铁工厂近五百吨废钢铁，今年五月份仅给天津钢厂的废钢铁就有六百多吨，六月份的头十天，又供给了二百吨。去年和今年供给北京市手工业联合总社一千五百多吨废钢铁，占全市手工业合作社所用的钢铁总量的一半。手工业合作社已制成质量好、价格便宜的大批锅、菜刀、饭勺等日常用品供应市场。山东、河北等地供销合作社从北京运去的几百吨废钢铁，也制成了新式农具。
    回收废金属是一项艰苦的但是很重要的工作。回收废金属要具有辨别废金属性能和质量的能力，要做繁杂的分类整理工作，要勤宣传，勤跑腿，以及把废金属管理好，以免国家资金积压和浪费。有些开始做这个工作的人，觉得又苦又脏，但是，当他们知道没有废钢，炼钢工人就不可能炼钢的时候，见到即使像垃圾一样的铜灰，也能加工成发亮的铜块的时候，知道回收废金属也是建设社会主义的一项不可少的工作。于是都积极克服困难，辛勤工作。
    铁道部门各机务段在生产过程中生产一种废料——铜铅混合金的屑末。据丰台机务段的人说：这种废料既不能回炉，又不能销售，于是只好浪费了。北京市供销合作总社收购废金属的工作人员听说后，就赶到丰台机务段，进行性能试制。经过三次试验，证明从这种屑末中，可以炼出百分之五十的杂铅和百分之三十的黄铜来。合作总社就开始收购，去年共收了十多吨。从此，不仅丰台机务段，而且连保定、张家口两机务段在内，都为铜铅混合金的屑末找到出路。
    长辛店机车车辆厂的铜炉灰，每月有十五吨到二十吨，过去一向被废弃着，但从去年三月起，北京市供销合作总社都把它回收来了。为了寻找过去长期被抛弃的铜炉灰，收购废金属的同志曾三次去这个厂了解，向附近居民打听，现在，大家都肯定厂内外地下埋的铜炉灰有几百吨到上千吨，如果有一千吨铜炉灰，就能炼出一百斤左右的杂铜，这是一个不小的数字。
    北京市工厂企业开展反浪费运动和青年节约队陆续建立以后，许多在过去曾被当作废料处理的金属，现在都被厂里自己回收并加以利用了。四月份以来，每月回收废金属的数量比第一季度各月平均增加了两倍。供销合作总社的收购站已由一百三十多处增加到二百多处。
    在回收的废金属中，约有百分之三十左右是来自街道居民家中的。自从去年六月北京市供销合作总社在人民群众中开展收购废金属的工作以后，市区郊区许多居民自动地把废铜烂铁卖给国家。宣武区供销合作社由于工作人员认真向人民群众宣传废铜烂铁对国家建设的重要意义，不嫌麻烦，处处采取便于群众出售的措施，在今年第一季度中，向街道居民收购的铜，就有三千五百斤，四、五两个月中，又收了三千二百斤。但是，有的区的合作社只收三、五十斤铜，有的区工作长期开展不起来。他们中有的人说：“废铜烂铁在抗日战争时期早给收光了，如今没有了。”有的嫌群众三两五两的出售太麻烦，因而借口没有时间，不进行收购工作。这些区合作社必须纠正错误认识，收购更多的废金属卖给国家！
