To improve the efficiency of transport on the Sichuan River, the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration has, since the second quarter of this year, been implementing timetables for key vessels of all types under its jurisdiction. So far, on the 600-kilometer route from Chongqing to Yichang, about 50% of the vessels are operating according to these timetables.

The vessel timetable is an advanced experience from Soviet inland water transport, which uses lines to represent the schedule of each route on a diagram. Organizing vessel operation according to the timetable allows vessels to crisscross on trackless waterways like trains, effectively ensuring the balanced fulfillment of transport tasks. In order to promote this advanced experience on the Sichuan River, known for its dangerous shoals, rapid currents, dense fog, and numerous reefs, the Chongqing Shipping Branch has conducted extensive publicity and education work, making the crew members understand the benefits of implementing timetables. Therefore, when formulating voyage and monthly operation plans, in addition to serious discussion and research, they also implemented technical operating procedures and strictly enforced the handover system on the basis of establishing a unified responsible system for safe production. When a vessel deviates from the timetable, they also try everything possible to get it back on track as soon as possible.

Due to the active efforts of the crew members, the accuracy of vessels arriving according to plan on the Sichuan River has reached over 98% monthly, and the punctuality has reached about 85%. Thanks to the close cooperation of relevant departments in various ports, the accuracy of the dispatch plan has reached 100% monthly, and the punctuality has reached about 95%. (Yi Jinren)

    川江重点实行船舶运行图
    长江航运管理局重庆分局所辖川江各类型船舶，从今年第二季度起，有重点地实行船舶运行图以来，到目前止，从重庆到宜昌六百多公里的航线上，纳入运行图的船舶约占百分之五十以上。
    船舶运行图是苏联内河航运的先进经验，即用线条把各航线的时刻表表现在图上。按运行图组织船舶运行，可以使船舶如同火车一样，在无轨的航线上交错奔驰，有效地保证均衡地完成运输任务。重庆航运分局为了使这一先进经验能在滩险、水急、雾浓、礁多的川江上推广，曾经多次进行了宣传教育工作，使船员们了解了实行运行图的好处。所以他们在制定航次和月作业计划的时候，除了认真地进行讨论和研究以外，还在建立安全生产统一负责制的基础上，贯彻了技术操作规程，严格执行交接班制度，并针对可能遇到的困难，想出了克服办法。运行船舶一旦脱线，他们也想一切办法，使尽快纳入线图。
    川江实行运行图的船舶，由于船员们的积极努力，到船计划的准确性，按月的达到了百分之九十八以上，按时的达到了百分之八十五左右；还由于各港口有关部门的密切配合，发船计划的准确性，按月的达到了百分之百，按时的达到了百分之九十五左右。　（易近仁）
