    On May 20th, this newspaper published an article titled "An 'Open-Pit Coal Mine' of 'Free Mining'," criticizing the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration for failing to address the phenomenon of large amounts of coal being discarded with gangue at the gangue unloading site, causing undue losses to national resources. The Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration has sent a letter of self-criticism and has adopted three concrete measures, such as strictly implementing separate mining and transportation operations on each tunneling face, to overcome the phenomenon of discarding coal. The Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration has also decided to launch a savings campaign in all mining areas of Kailuan, inspect wasteful phenomena, establish necessary systems, and plug loopholes.
