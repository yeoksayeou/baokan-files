    Flood Reporting Radio Stations Across the Country Begin Transmitting Flood Information
    The flood reporting radio stations established by the postal and telecommunications departments in various places to cooperate with flood prevention have begun transmitting flood information, and the transmission situation is very good.
    This year, the number of flood reporting radio stations established by the postal and telecommunications departments is more than double that of 1950 and 23 percent more than that of 1954. The personnel and equipment of the radio stations are larger in scale than in previous years. Among this year's flood reporting radio stations, 18 are set up to cooperate with the electricity department's flood reporting needs, and the rest are set up in places along rivers where there are no telecommunications bureaus.
