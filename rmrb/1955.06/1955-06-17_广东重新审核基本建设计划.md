Guangdong Province's Planning Commission, in order to continue implementing the principle of focusing on key construction projects, has re-examined the basic construction plan for 1955. It has now cut some unnecessary projects, saving a considerable amount of funds for the country. For example, the new factory building project of the Zhanjiang Machinery Factory used existing equipment, saving more than 1.45 million yuan; the South China Normal College, after rearranging the construction plan, reduced investment by more than 1.43 million yuan. Other projects, such as the Haikou Brick and Tile Factory, Wenchang Power Plant, Dazhen Farm, and Guangzhou Hygiene School, a total of fourteen units, saved an investment amount accounting for 5.45% of the province's annual basic construction plan investment due to the use of existing equipment and readjustments.

    广东重新审核基本建设计划
    广东省计划委员会为了继续贯彻重点建设的方针，重新对一九五五年度基本建设计划进行审核。现在已经削减了一些不必要的项目，为国家节省了不少资金。如湛江机械厂新建厂房工程利用现有设备，节约了一百四十五万多元；华南师范学院经过重新安排建设计划，核减投资一百四十三万多元。其他如海口砖瓦厂，文昌电厂、大镇农场、广州卫生学校等十四个单位的工程，由于利用原有设备，重新调整安排，节约的投资额占全省基本建设年度计划投资额的百分之五点四五。
