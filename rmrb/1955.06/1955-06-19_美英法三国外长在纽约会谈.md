Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 18th: According to TASS, New York, June 18th, British Foreign Secretary Macmillan and French Foreign Minister Pinay arrived in New York on the 16th. On the same day, they held talks with US Secretary of State Dulles, who had specially come to New York.

From reports in American newspapers, it can be seen that the purpose of this one-sided meeting is to ease, as much as possible, the contradictions between the three Western countries on issues that may be discussed at the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference in Geneva, and to agree on a common point of view before going to San Francisco to discuss the agenda of the Big Four summit with Molotov.

"Newsweek" pointed out the differences in the attitudes of the three Western countries. The magazine said that the United States has adopted a negative attitude towards the Soviet proposal to limit armaments and ban weapons of mass destruction. France takes a very serious attitude towards this proposal. The United States opposes discussing the Far East issue at the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference, while Britain does not object to discussing this issue "if it is possible to achieve any results."

Some time ago, American newspapers also reported that the Western countries had differences on the duration of the Four-Power Conference.

On June 17th, the one-sided meeting of Western countries continued with the participation of West German Chancellor Adenauer. In addition to participating in the meeting of the three foreign ministers, Adenauer held talks with British Foreign Secretary Macmillan on the evening of June 17th, and with French Foreign Minister Pinay on June 18th.

The official communique issued after the meeting of the three foreign ministers on June 16th stated:

"Everyone exchanged general views on the preparations for the meeting that the three foreign ministers hope to hold with Mr. Molotov in San Francisco on June 20th. At the present stage, the main issue for discussion is the preparation of the procedure to be proposed to Mr. Molotov for the Heads of Government Conference, which has now been finalized to be held in Geneva on July 18th."

The "New York Herald Tribune" reported that most of the time during the meeting of the three foreign ministers was spent studying the recent diplomatic measures taken by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions. United Press International reported that the meeting on the 16th mainly discussed the Soviet note to the Federal Republic of Germany.

    美英法三国外长在纽约会谈
    新华社十八日讯　据塔斯社纽约十八日讯：英国外交大臣麦克米伦和法国外交部长比内十六日到达纽约。当天，他们就同特地来到纽约的美国国务卿杜勒斯进行了会谈。
    从美国报纸的报道中可以看出，这种片面会谈的目的是，尽可能地缓和西方三国之间在可能成为日内瓦四国政府首脑会议讨论对象的那些问题上的矛盾，以及在到旧金山同莫洛托夫讨论四大国最高级会议的议程之前商定共同观点。
    “新闻周刊”指出西方三国态度的分歧。杂志说，美国对苏联所提出的关于限制军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的建议采取否定态度。法国对这个建议则采取十分认真的态度。美国反对在四国政府首脑会议上讨论远东问题，而英国不反对讨论这种问题，“如果有可能达到什么结果的话”。
    前些时候美国报纸也曾经报道，西方国家在四大国会议的期限问题上有分歧。
    六月十七日，西方国家的片面会谈在西德总理阿登纳参加下继续举行。阿登纳除了参加三国外长会谈外，十七日晚间同英国外交大臣麦克米伦会谈，六月十八日同法国外交部长比内会谈。
    三国外长十六日会谈后发出的正式公报说：
  “大家就三国外长希望在六月二十日在旧金山同莫洛托夫先生举行会谈的准备工作交换了一般的意见。在目前阶段，讨论的主要问题是准备向莫洛托夫先生提出的关于现在已经最终决定七月十八日在日内瓦举行的政府首脑会议的程序问题。”
    “纽约先驱论坛报”消息说，三国外长会谈的大部分时间是研究苏联最近为了和缓国际紧张局势而采取的外交措施。合众社消息说，十六日会谈主要是讨论了苏联给德意志联邦共和国的照会。
