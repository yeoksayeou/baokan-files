Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: In order to implement the spirit of comprehensive thrift, the central-level industrial and transportation departments are separately drafting requirements and measures for saving national construction funds this year or in the next three years. Some departments have initially drafted plans and are preparing to distribute them to grassroots units for discussion and implementation.

The Ministry of Heavy Industry, based on the report of Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, has made preliminary regulations on the cost indicators of civil buildings of the ministry in different regions. According to the new indicators, the cost of civil buildings in various regions will be reduced, and some multi-story buildings will be changed to single-story buildings. The Ministry of Heavy Industry divided all projects into three categories according to the construction progress: those that started before May, those that must start in June, and those that will start after June. It studied each item according to the specific situation. Some projects that are about to be completed will also save investment by reducing unnecessary decorations. Control figures for reducing costs will be set for each project and submitted to grassroots units for discussion and implementation.

The First Ministry of Machine Building deployed comprehensive conservation work at a recent factory director's meeting. In terms of capital construction, it is required to save national construction funds by changing unreasonable designs, reducing unnecessary projects, lowering construction standards, and reducing other expenses, while ensuring the progress and quality of key projects. After research, the meeting has put forward preliminary indicators for saving investment.

The Ministry of Fuel Industry has also formulated a preliminary savings plan. According to this plan, the Ministry of Fuel Industry expects to save more than 100 million yuan in construction funds this year. Among them, the investment in non-productive buildings in the power system will account for more than 40% of the original plan. The Petroleum Administration Bureau has initially decided to change the originally high-standard buildings in Yumen, Sichuan, and other places into single-story buildings. This item alone is expected to reduce the cost of engineering by more than 30%.

In deploying comprehensive conservation, the Ministry of Construction Engineering first proposed measures to save investment in a number of contracted projects that have already started or must start in June. They are prepared to discuss with the construction units and re-examine the doors and windows, sanitary heating equipment, interior and exterior painting, floors, roofs, ceilings, building height, etc. of this batch of projects without changing the building structure. Items that can be cancelled will be cancelled, items that can be merged will be merged, and items that can be reduced will be reduced, to ensure that these projects can still meet the prescribed cost reduction targets. At the same time, the Ministry of Construction Engineering is actively organizing design forces and collecting data, preparing to make standard designs for offices, university and technical school buildings, and dormitories as soon as possible.

The Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Ministry of Local Industry have also initially formulated plans to save investment. The Ministry of Textile Industry decided to save another 90 million yuan in investment on the premise that investment projects and production scale remain unchanged. The Ministry of Light Industry has initially determined that it can save more than 25% of the total capital construction investment in the next three years. At the recent meeting of directors of provincial and municipal industrial bureaus across the country, the Ministry of Local Industry initially determined that local industrial capital construction across the country will save the country 120 million yuan in investment around 1955 to 1957 to support national key construction (including the part reduced after the second national provincial and municipal planning meeting). After listening to the report of Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, the representatives decided to adopt the method of revising the design to reduce the cost of construction and installation projects from the second half of this year, saving 13% to 15% of the investment, and ensuring that the province and city's main productive projects are carried out well while saving funds.

Among the transportation departments, in addition to the Ministry of Railways, which has formulated a preliminary plan to save more than 590 million yuan in investment in the next three years, and has distributed it to various places through telephone conferences, the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications have also formulated preliminary savings plans. In terms of civil buildings alone, the Ministry of Transportation expects to save 52% of the original planned investment in civil buildings in the next three years. In addition to saving capital construction investment, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is also preparing to dispose of overstocked equipment worth more than 40 million yuan in 1955 and 1956.

    中央各工业交通部门
    拟订节约建设资金方案
    据新华社二十一日讯中央一级工业、交通部门为贯彻全面节约精神，正在分别拟订今年或今后三年内节省国家建设资金的要求和措施，有的部门并已初步拟订出方案，准备下达到各基层单位讨论和执行。
    重工业部根据国务院副总理李富春的报告，对本部在不同地区的民用建筑的造价指标作了初步规定。根据新的指标，各不同地区民用建筑造价都将降低，有的楼房将改为平房。重工业部把所有工程按施工进度分为五月前已动工的、六月必须动工的和六月以后动工的三类，按照具体情况逐项进行了研究，某些将要完工的工程，也将从减少不必要的装饰方面节约投资。各项工程都将订出降低造价的控制数字，交基层单位讨论执行。
    第一机械工业部在最近召开的厂长会议上布置了全面节约工作。在基本建设方面，要求在保证重点工程建设进度和质量的基础上，从改变不合理设计、削减不必要的工程项目、降低建筑标准、减少其他费用开支等方面，为国家节省建设资金。会议经过研究，已提出了节约投资的初步指标。
    燃料工业部也已制定了初步节约方案。根据这一方案，燃料工业部今年预计可以节约建设资金一亿元以上。其中电业系统非生产性建筑的投资，节约部分就将占到原计划百分之四十以上。石油管理总局已初步确定把玉门、四川等地原来标准较高的楼房改为平房，仅这一项预计就可降低工程造价百分之三十以上。
    建筑工程部在布置全面节约中，首先对一部分已经开工或在六月份必须开工的承包工程拟出节约投资的措施。他们准备和各建设单位商议，在不改变建筑结构的情况下，对这批工程的门窗、卫生采暖设备、室内外的粉刷、地板、屋顶、天棚、楼房高度等重新加以审查，可取消的取消，可合并的合并，可降低的降低，以保证这些工程仍能达到规定的降低造价的指标。同时，建筑工程部正在积极组织设计力量和搜集资料，准备及早作出办公室、大学专科学校和宿舍的降低造价的标准设计。
    纺织工业部、轻工业部、地方工业部也都已初步订出节约投资的方案。纺织工业部决定在投资项目及生产规模不变的条件下，再节省投资九千万元。轻工业部初步确定了今后三年内可节省全部基本建设投资额百分之二十五以上。地方工业部在最近召开的全国各省市工业厅局长会议上，初步确定了全国地方工业基本建设在一九五五年到一九五七年前后为国家节省投资一亿二千万元，以支援国家重点建设的方案（包括第二次全国省市计划会议后削减的部分在内）。到会代表在听了国务院副总理李富春的报告后，决定从今年下半年起就从建筑安装工程中，采取修改设计降低造价的办法，节约投资百分之十三到百分之十五，并保证在节约资金同时把省、市内主要生产性的工程搞好。
    在交通部门中，除铁道部已订出今后三年内节约投资五亿九千多万元的初步方案，并通过电话会议下达到各地以外，交通部和邮电部也已订出初步节约方案。交通部仅在民用建筑方面，今后三年就预计可以节省出占民用建筑原来计划百分之五十二的投资。邮电部除节约基本建设投资外，并准备在一九五五年、一九五六年两年内处理价值四千多万元的积压器材。
