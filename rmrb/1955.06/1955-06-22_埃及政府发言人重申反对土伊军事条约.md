    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 21st: An Egyptian government spokesman said on the 20th that Egypt has not changed its policy of opposing the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty.
    The spokesman said that Egypt believes the treaty between Britain, Iraq, and Turkey endangers the Arab League and seriously affects the unity of Arab countries. He said that for Arab countries, the only path is not to participate in treaties and alliances like the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, and to strengthen their position "with a purely Arab treaty that unites their ranks."

    埃及政府发言人重申反对土伊军事条约
    新华社二十一日讯　开罗消息：埃及政府发言人二十日说，埃及并没有改变它反对土耳其—伊拉克军事条约的政策。
    发言人说，埃及认为，英国、伊拉克和土耳其之间的条约危害着阿拉伯联盟，严重影响着阿拉伯国家的团结。他说，对于阿拉伯国家来说，唯一的道路就是不参加像土耳其—伊拉克条约这样的条约和联盟，并“以一个统一它们的队伍的纯阿拉伯条约”来加强它们的地位。
