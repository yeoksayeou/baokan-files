Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: The Local Industry Department held a meeting of national provincial and municipal industrial bureau directors in Beijing from June 1st to 17th. The meeting focused on studying how local industries can implement overall planning, rationally arrange production, improve enterprise management, and handle issues such as basic construction and organizational leadership.

Since the first quarter of this year, the Local Industry Department, together with relevant departments, has successively convened specialized meetings on three types of writing instruments (pens, steel-nib pens, and pencils), chemical raw materials, leather, oils and fats, and cigarettes, carrying out national balancing and specific arrangements between regions for these industries. Local industries in cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin have also conducted arrangements industry by industry. The difficulties in the arranged industries have been reduced, and production has initially stabilized. However, the meeting believes that the task of arranging production for local industries in the future remains arduous. In order to further improve this work, it is necessary to apply the experience already gained, that is, the arrangement of production must be combined with increasing production and practicing economy, and with the reorganization and transformation of private industries.

The meeting believes that the production difficulties in most industries stem from insufficient raw materials. Therefore, it is necessary to strive to conserve raw materials and reduce raw material consumption quotas on the premise of ensuring quality, so as to increase products on this basis, meet social needs, and thereby overcome the difficulties of enterprises in production.

The meeting emphasized that in the past, in the work of arranging production, it was found that some capitalists adopted a passive waiting attitude, relying solely on the government, and not actively improving business management; some even took various illegal and destructive actions. Appropriate and resolute struggle must be carried out against these wrong behaviors. When making arrangements, private enterprises of this kind should be urged to change this unreasonable situation before they can be given the necessary consideration.

The fact that enterprise management work cannot keep up with the requirements of production development, resulting in high costs, low quality, many accidents, and low output, is the main shortcoming of local industries at present. Therefore, the meeting determined that in the future, the focus must be on implementing professional management and strengthening technical leadership, and correspondingly strengthening financial cost management and establishing and improving the responsibility system, in order to improve enterprise management work.

The meeting pointed out that the urgent task of basic construction of local industries at present is to resolutely implement the Central Government's spirit of comprehensive economy. It is required that from the basic construction investment from 1955 to 1957, in addition to the 70 million yuan reduced after the Second National Provincial and Municipal Planning Conference, another 50 million yuan should be reduced. The meeting pointed out that an important link in completing the task of economy is to strengthen and improve design work, and all localities should conscientiously reduce the cost standards of construction projects in accordance with regulations.

The meeting also made specific studies on the issue of organizational leadership of local industries.

Finally, the meeting emphasized that political and ideological work should be particularly strengthened in local industrial work.

    全国省市工业厅局长在北京举行会议
    着重研究了地方工业统筹安排等问题
    据新华社二十一日讯　地方工业部从六月一日到十七日在北京召开全国省市工业厅局长会议。会议着重研究了地方工业如何贯彻统筹兼顾合理安排生产、企业管理以及基本建设、组织领导等问题。
    从今年第一季度以来，地方工业部曾会同有关部门先后召开了三笔（金笔、钢笔、铅笔）、化工原料、皮革、油脂、卷烟等专业会议，对这些行业进行了全国平衡和地区间的具体安排；上海、天津等市的地方工业也都逐行逐业地进行了安排。经过安排的行业困难已经缩小，生产初步稳定。但是，会议认为今后地方工业的生产安排工作仍是繁重的，为了进一步做好这个工作，必须运用已经取得的经验，即安排生产必须与增产节约相结合，与对私营工业的改组改造工作相结合。
    会议认为多数行业的生产困难来自原料不足，因此必须在保证质量的条件下努力节约原料，降低原料消耗定额，以便在这个基础上增加产品，满足社会需要，从而克服企业在生产上的困难。
    会议强调指出，过去在进行安排生产的工作中曾发现有些资本家采取消极等待、单纯依赖政府、不积极改善经营管理的态度；有的甚至采取种种违法破坏行为，对于这些错误行为必须进行适当的坚决的斗争。在安排时，对这一类的私营企业就要督促他们改变这种不合理的情况，才能给以必要的照顾。
    企业管理工作跟不上生产发展的要求，成本高、质量低、事故多、产品少，是当前地方工业的主要缺点，因此会议确定：今后必须以实行专业管理、加强技术领导为重点，相应地加强财务成本管理，建立与健全责任制度，以便改善企业管理工作。
    会议指出，当前地方工业基本建设的迫切任务是坚决贯彻中央的全面节约精神。要求从一九五五年到一九五七年的基本建设投资中，除全国第二次省市计划会议以后削减的七千万元以外，再削减五千万元。会议指出完成节约任务的重要环节是加强和改进设计工作，各地应认真按照规定降低建筑工程的造价标准。
    关于地方工业的组织领导问题，会议也作了具体的研究。
    最后，会议强调：在地方工业工作中应特别加强政治思想工作。
