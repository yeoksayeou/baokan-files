The Founding Assembly of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, on June 10, 1955, passed the following resolution at its plenary session:

    The Founding Assembly of the Chinese Academy of Sciences listened to the report by President Guo Moruo, reports from the four academic divisions, and other important reports. It listened to the explanation of the draft outline of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' First Five-Year Plan and discussed this plan outline. Thirty-nine academic papers were read and discussed at the meeting. Each academic division also elected its standing committee.

    Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Lu Dingyi, gave important instructions to the assembly, greatly inspiring all scientists. We will follow these instructions, strive to improve ourselves, and improve our work.

    President Guo Moruo's report correctly summarized the scientific work of the past five years and put forward the tasks for future work and measures to improve work. We unanimously agree and decide to implement it in our work. All members of the academic divisions should actively participate in scientific research work and improve China's scientific level.

    The assembly basically agreed with the "Draft Outline of the First Five-Year Plan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences" and put forward important suggestions for revision. It is recommended that the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Council revise the plan outline based on the opinions put forward by the assembly, submit it to the government for approval, and then implement it. The key tasks listed in the plan must be guaranteed, and other tasks should also be actively carried out. Comprehensive research must be strengthened, and the principle of reasonable distribution of research institutions must be implemented.

    The Chinese Academy of Sciences should quickly formulate a fifteen-year development perspective plan and submit a draft within one year; the planning of the national scientific undertakings should also be formulated as soon as possible in cooperation with relevant government departments, especially the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Higher Education. All members of the academic divisions should actively participate in these tasks.

    The assembly basically agreed with the reports of each academic division and the work plans of each academic division for 1955. The standing committees of each academic division should revise and supplement them based on the opinions discussed at the assembly and submit them to the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Council for approval.

    The academic papers read at the assembly were all subjected to heated discussions, and academic criticism and self-criticism were carried out. This is a very good phenomenon. Free academic debate is of great significance for improving the scientific level and should be promoted. In the future, each academic division and research institute must actively lead and carry out academic discussions in a planned way to ensure the healthy development of scientific work and promote the growth of new forces.

    Bourgeois idealist thought still has a broad and profound influence in many scientific departments. This influence hinders the progress of science and must be exposed and criticized. Striving to study Marxism-Leninism, establishing a dialectical materialist worldview, and constantly opposing the erosion of science by bourgeois idealism are important links in improving the ideological level of Chinese scientific workers. In each scientific field, this study and discussion must be carried out step by step in light of the actual situation.

    We must attach importance to the scientific heritage of the motherland. This is the precious wealth accumulated by our ancestors in practice over thousands of years. Chinese scientists must actively study and promote it. The extremely rich experience of our working people in production must also be systematically summarized and raised to the theoretical level in order to develop science and guide practice.

    Further studying the advanced science of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and learning from the outstanding scientific achievements of all countries in the world are important conditions for the development of China's science. Each academic division should actively promote and organize this study. In recent years, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have given great help to China's scientific work. Recently, the Soviet Union decided to help China develop the peaceful use of atomic energy. Chinese scientific workers express their heartfelt gratitude for this selfless assistance. The assembly believes that we must further develop scientific cooperation between China and other fraternal countries and promote scientific and cultural exchanges with other countries in the world. The assembly fully supports the final communiqué of the Asian-African Conference and the resolutions of the Asian Countries Conference, and hopes that the old cultural ties between Asian and African countries will be newly developed.

    The establishment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' academic divisions is an important step in the development of China's scientific undertakings. The assembly calls on scientific workers across the country to further unite, make more and greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland, achieve greater achievements in all scientific fields, and, together with the people of the whole country, heighten vigilance, prevent enemy sabotage activities, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the complete elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We will never allow the American aggressive group to forcibly occupy our territory and interfere in our internal affairs!

    We severely condemn war conspiracies and oppose the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. We must strengthen our unity with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, strengthen our unity with the Asian and African countries and all peace-loving people in the world, and defend science and culture, and defend world peace!

    中国科学院学部成立大会总决议
    一九五五年六月十日中国科学院学部成立大会全体会议通过
    中国科学院学部成立大会听取了郭沫若院长的报告、四个学部的报告和其他重要报告，听取了中国科学院第一个五年计划纲要草案的说明并讨论了这个计划纲要。在会上宣读并讨论了三十九篇学术论文。各学部还选出了学部常务委员会。
    周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和中国共产党中央委员会宣传部陆定一部长对大会作了重要指示，给全体科学家以极大的鼓舞。我们将遵循这些指示，努力提高自己，改进工作。
    郭沫若院长的报告正确地总结了五年以来的科学工作，提出了今后的工作任务和改进工作的措施，我们一致同意并决定在工作中加以贯彻。全体学部委员要积极参加科学研究工作，提高我国科学水平。
    大会基本上同意“中国科学院第一个五年计划纲要草案”，并提出了重要的修正意见，建议中国科学院院务委员会根据大会所提出的意见对计划纲要加以修订，呈报政府批准后执行。计划中所列的重点工作必须保证，其他工作也必须积极进行。综合性的研究必须加强，研究机构合理分布的原则必须贯彻。
    中国科学院应迅速拟订十五年发展远景计划，并在一年内提出草案；全国科学事业的规划亦应协同政府有关部门特别是国家计划委员会、高等教育部从速制定。全体学部委员应积极参加这些工作。
    大会基本上同意各学部的报告及各学部的一九五五年工作计划，应由各学部常务委员会根据大会讨论的意见加以修改和补充，呈报中国科学院院务委员会批准。
    在大会上所宣读的学术论文都经过了热烈的讨论，开展了学术上的批评与自我批评，这是一种很好的现象，学术上的自由争论对于提高科学水平具有重大意义，应该加以发扬。今后各学部和各研究所必须有计划地积极领导开展学术讨论，以保证科学工作的健康发展，促进新生力量的成长。
    资产阶级唯心主义思想目前在许多科学部门中还具有广泛而深刻的影响。这种影响妨碍了科学的前进，必须加以揭发与批判。努力学习马克思列宁主义，确立辩证唯物主义的世界观，不断反对资产阶级唯心主义对于科学的侵蚀，是提高我国科学工作者思想水平的重要环节。在各个科学领域内必须结合实际情况有步骤地开展这种学习和讨论。
    必须重视祖国的科学遗产，这是几千年来我们祖先在实践中不断积累下来的宝贵财富，我国科学家必须积极加以研究与发扬。对我国劳动人民在生产中的极其丰富的经验，也必须系统地进行总结，提高到理论的水平，以发展科学，指导实践。
    进一步学习苏联和各人民民主国家先进科学，学习世界各国优秀的科学成就，是发展我国科学的重要条件，各学部应积极推动与组织这种学习。几年来，苏联和各人民民主国家对于我国科学工作给了很大的帮助，最近苏联又决定帮助我国发展原子能和平利用的事业，中国科学工作者对于这种无私的援助表示衷心感激。大会认为，必须进一步发展我国与各兄弟国家之间科学的合作，促进和世界上其他国家科学文化的交流。大会完全拥护亚非会议的最后公报和亚洲国家会议的决议，希望亚非各国之间旧有的文化联系获得新的发展。
    中国科学院学部的成立是发展我国科学事业的重要步骤。大会号召全国科学工作者进一步团结起来，在祖国的社会主义建设中作出更多更大的贡献，在各门科学领域中取得更大的成就，并和全国人民一起，提高警惕，防止敌人的破坏活动，为解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团而斗争。我们决不容许美国侵略集团用武力霸占我国领土，对我国内政进行干涉！
    我们严厉地谴责战争阴谋，反对使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器。我们要加强与苏联及各人民民主国家的团结，加强与亚非各国及世界上一切爱好和平的人民的团结，保卫科学与文化，保卫世界和平！
