    Shanxi to Dispatch 8,000 Cadres to Form Long-Term Rural Work Teams
    Hunan Provincial Organs to Dispatch 1,000 Cadres to Work in Rural Areas
    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to dispatch 8,000 cadres to form long-term, fixed rural work teams to go deep into the countryside to assist local agricultural producers' cooperatives in their work. These cadres will soon begin to be assembled.
    This decision to dispatch a large number of cadres to the countryside is a major measure taken by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to ensure the smooth progress of the socialist transformation of agriculture. This measure was decided upon after reviewing the rural work situation in the province at the recent provincial party representative conference. Currently, there are 31,926 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Shanxi Province, with farmer households joining cooperatives accounting for 42% of the province's total farmer households. Most of these cooperatives meet the requirements, but all have problems to varying degrees, and a few have more problems. Therefore, consolidating the existing 30,000-plus agricultural producers' cooperatives is a fundamental link related to the future socialist transformation of agriculture. The conference unanimously agreed to dispatch a large number of cadres to form work teams and determined that their main tasks are to help local farmers carry out agricultural production activities centered on mutual aid and cooperation; complete the unified purchase and sale of grain; and strengthen party consolidation and the party's political and ideological work.
    This dispatch of cadres is carried out in accordance with the principle of streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels. All cadres are drawn from the organs and organizations of the province, various special districts, and counties. After these cadres are assembled, they will undergo short-term training to study relevant policy documents of the Party. Then, under the leadership of the various county committees of the Chinese Communist Party, they will form work groups, with key townships or the central agricultural producers' cooperatives of mutual aid and cooperation networks as units, and settle down for a long time to help them work.

    Hunan Province's provincial organs are dispatching 1,000 cadres in batches to the countryside to strengthen the leadership of the agricultural cooperativization movement in various places. Currently, the first batch of 200 people has been dispatched to the six counties in the Dongting Lake area of Hanshou, Huarong, Anxiang, Nanxian, Lixian, and Changde, and the counties of Ningxiang, Xiangtan, and Changsha under the Xiangtan Prefectural Commissioner's Office. The second batch of cadres to be sent to the countryside will also be dispatched to various places in early July. At the same time, various special districts will also dispatch a large number of cadres to the countryside one after another.
    These cadres dispatched to the countryside include veteran cadres who have undergone long-term training, as well as intellectuals who are enthusiastic about socialist construction. They will work in the countryside for a relatively long time in order to systematically help farmers carry out the agricultural cooperativization movement. After they go to the countryside, they will systematically and selectively first help the existing agricultural producers' cooperatives to do a good job in production and strive for a bumper harvest, so that the farmers who join the cooperatives can increase their income. In conjunction with production, they will gradually resolve the remaining problems in some cooperatives, such as the evaluation of land production, the pricing of cattle, and the unequal distribution of land and labor. At the same time, they will also help various places strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams, actively preparing conditions for further developing new cooperatives in the future.

    山西将抽调八千干部组成长期农村工作队
    湖南省级机关抽调一千干部到农村工作
    中共山西省委员会决定抽调八千个干部组成长期固定的农村工作队，深入农村，协助当地农业生产合作社进行工作。这批干部不久就要开始调集。
    这次决定抽调大批干部下乡是中共山西省委员会为保证农业社会主义改造顺利进行的一项重大措施。这一措施是在最近召开的全省党代表会议上检查了全省农村工作情况后决定的。目前，山西全省农业生产合作社已有三万一千九百二十六个，入社农户占全省总农户的百分之四十二。这些社大部分是合乎要求的，但都程度不同地存在着问题，少数社问题较多。因此，巩固现有三万多个农业生产合作社是关系今后农业社会主义改造的根本环节。会议一致同意抽调大批干部组成工作队，并确定它的主要任务是帮助当地农民开展以互助合作为中心的农业生产活动；完成粮食统购统销工作；加强整党及党的政治思想工作。
    这次抽调干部是根据精简上层充实下层的方针进行的，全部干部都是从省级、各专区和各县的机关团体抽调的。这些干部调集后将集中进行短期训练，学习党的有关政策文件，然后，在各中共县委领导下组成工作组，以重点乡或互助合作网的中心农业生产合作社为单位，长期固定下来帮助它们工作。  （新华社）
    湖南省省级机关抽调一千个干部，分批下乡，加强各地对农业合作化运动的领导。现在，第一批二百人已经分赴洞庭湖滨地区的汉寿、华容、安乡、南县、澧县、常德六县和湘潭专署的宁乡、湘潭、长沙等县。第二批下乡干部也将在七月上旬分赴各地。在这同时，各专区也将先后调派大批干部下乡。
    这些抽调下乡的干部有经过长期锻炼的老干部，也有热情从事社会主义建设的知识分子。他们将在农村工作一个比较长的时间，以便系统地帮助农民开展农业合作化运动。他们下乡后，将有计划、有重点地首先帮助现有的农业生产合作社搞好生产，争取丰收，使入社农民能够增加收入。并结合生产，逐步解决部分合作社存在的土地评产、耕牛作价和土地劳力分益不够合理等遗留问题。同时，还帮助各地加强对互助组的领导，为今后进一步发展新社积极准备条件。  （新华社）
