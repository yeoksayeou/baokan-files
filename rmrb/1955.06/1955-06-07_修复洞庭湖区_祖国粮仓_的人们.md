The people who repair the Dongting Lake Area's "Granary of the Motherland"
    Zeng Gu, Shu Xuyi
    Dongting Lake, what a fascinating place. Since ancient times, it has left people with many moving poems and myths. Today, on the edge of this largest freshwater lake in the country, a vast plain embraces it. People affectionately call this beautiful and fertile land the "Granary of the Motherland" and the "Land of Fish and Rice." On the six million mu of fertile land bordering the lake, more than four billion jin of rice and 350,000 dan of cotton can be produced annually.
    However, due to the continuous influx of large amounts of sediment into the lake from the four outlets of the Yangtze River (Ouchi, Songzi, Taiping, and Tiaoxian) and the four rivers of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li, the lake bed has gradually silted up, resulting in a disordered water system with mutual interference and support. Successive reactionary rulers never seriously managed it, resulting in the abandonment of dikes and frequent floods. In the summer of 1954, the Dongting Lake area again suffered from floods unseen in a century.
    In order to help the people in the lake area restore production and rebuild their homes, in the summer of 1954, the Party and the People's Government, while leading the people along the lake to fight the floods day and night, began planning the Dongting Lake dike repair project. This repair project, in accordance with the central instructions and the current situation of Dongting Lake, adopted the policy of focusing on repairs, healing wounds, eliminating hidden dangers, reinforcing dangerous dikes, planned diversion and blocking of outlets, combined construction of large enclosures, and striving for agricultural harvest. This policy combined both fundamental and symptomatic treatment, emphasizing both flood control and drainage, which not only met the urgent needs of the people in the Dongting Lake area to restore production, but also conformed to the long-term plan to fundamentally control the Dongting Lake water disaster.
    The people in the lake area wholeheartedly supported this policy, and the people of the whole province and the whole country supported this large-scale construction project. Since last October, steel bars from the Northeast, cement from Shanghai and Wuhan, cabbage from Inner Mongolia, pickled mustard from Sichuan, rice from Guizhou... more than 700,000 tons of lake management materials began to be transported from all over the country and the province to the construction site; 850,000 migrant workers, workers, cadres, doctors, teachers, students... flocked to Dongting Lake from all directions. People participated in the lake management work one after another under the call of repairing the "Granary of the Motherland".
    In November, the roaring lake water began to restrain its raging waves and retreated from the dikes that it had wantonly ravaged. People occupied the positions evacuated by the flood and set up work sheds stretching for thousands of miles. On December 1, the Hunan Province Dongting Lake Dike Repair Project Headquarters issued a commencement order, and the heroic battle of the 850,000-strong labor army began.
    Soon after the start of construction, the construction site encountered the second cold wave of 1954. Such a severe frost is rare in the South: the temperature suddenly dropped from 20 degrees Celsius to minus 8 to 12 degrees Celsius, thick ice formed on the lake, and the power lines that reached everywhere were covered with icicles as thick as wine glasses. During the ten days of such freezing weather, the migrant workers still insisted on going to work, and shouted the heroic words of "Make the snow dikes take off their clothes, make the icy rivers give way." They wore clothes and hats covered with a thin layer of ice, braving the severe cold wind and heavy snow, and pried open nearly one meter thick solid ice, took out more than 1.6 million cubic meters of mud, and sent it to the embankment; they also blocked six large and small river mouths in the cold and biting rapids. On December 26, during the blocking project of Yanwang Lake, Youth League member Tong Changgen had been working on the construction site for a whole day, and he was unwilling to delay even the time to go back to the work shed for a sip of water. When he was thirsty, he grabbed the snow on the ground or the icicles on the roadside and stuffed them into his mouth, and rushed forward again with his load. The young migrant worker Tong Haitang, known as "brave man," ran on the earth road covered with ice floes. He wore out a pair of straw sandals and put on the second pair. When it was almost time to stop working, the second pair of straw sandals was also worn out, so he simply walked barefoot. In this way, they blocked this 150-meter-wide torrent in twenty-three days and nights, carrying more than twice as much earthwork as originally planned. Such moving deeds are countless. Everyone on the construction site knew the damming hero Tang Zemou. When the damming project at Xiama River was about to close, he took the lead in jumping into the cold, deep water, holding willow branches tightly against his waist to reduce the speed of the current, so that other migrant workers could smoothly carry the soil; he jumped into the water not once, but twice, three times in such weather. It was they who overcame one severe cold snowstorm after another with their fiery labor enthusiasm.
    Following the ice and snow came continuous spring rains. In rainy days, people competed with mud for roads and with spring water for soil fields. The migrant workers of the Second Squad of the Fourth Brigade of the Ningxiang Corps went to work in the rain, and their clothes were all wet, but no one was willing to retreat. Communist Party member Cheng Fusheng said well: "Hero Huang Jiguang used to go in and out of gunfire, are we still afraid of this little raindrop?" Yes, their strong fighting spirit was enough to frighten heavy rain and strong winds. At the edge of Niushi Lake, the migrant workers had rescued the surrounding dike from seven or eight typhoons six times. On the dark night of February 18, a level 7 typhoon stirred up the turbid waves of Niushi Lake, more than one person high, rushing towards the dike one after another. The migrant workers of the Sixth Squad of the Fourteenth Brigade of the Changde Third Corps braved the wind and rain to protect the dike. The straw hats they wore on their heads were blown into the water by the wind, and the ropes of the raincoats they wore were also broken by the wind. People could only close their mouths tightly, making it difficult even to exhale. The dike was slippery with mud from the rain, and the migrant workers fell and got up again, carrying soil and dragging reeds to reinforce the dike. At the most critical moment, many people jumped into the water, using their bodies to block the waves and drive piles to protect the dike. How high the water rose, how high the dike was built. When they fought all night, the wind stopped and the waves subsided, and a red sun emerged from the lake, they couldn't help cheering as they looked at the undamaged earth field.
    In the difficult work of blocking outlets and building dikes through the lake in dozens of places, the migrant workers showed unparalleled heroism. The famous Xiaogang blocking project of Yuan River floodway was more than 600 meters wide, 12 meters deep, and had 4 meters of silt at the bottom, and the flow of water usually reached 400 cubic meters per second. When the large river mouth was closed, Youth League member Zhang Dongcheng and others jumped into the water holding grass bags. Regardless of the huge waves that tossed them back and forth, and the turbid mud that choked them, they finally held the grass bags firmly and built a "human wall" in the water, allowing grass bags to be stacked one after another to form a water barrier, finally blocking the river mouth of Xiaogang. The collapse of the dike construction project through the lake was very serious. However, the migrant workers resolutely stated: "The dike collapses, but our hearts do not! If it collapses one foot, we will fill ten feet." The Minkang Lake, Guangtang Lake and other places collapsed more than 200 times before and after. The migrant workers used their iron carrying poles and hard shoulders to finally split the center of the lake and build a majestic dike. The earthwork of these difficult collapses totaled more than 13 million cubic meters. If it were used to build a road three feet high and two feet four feet wide, it could extend from Changsha to Beijing.
    During the project, people not only put in hard work, but also demonstrated collective wisdom and creativity. The entire work area launched a labor competition and set off a climax of rationalization proposals. Gate construction workers, carrying workers, digging workers, inspection and stamping workers, tamping workers, and even cooks, all used their brains to find tricks and created many advanced tools and complete sets of advanced operating methods.
    On the various dike sections of the construction site, the "live hook dumping method" in which the migrant workers dumped soil without putting down the baskets or bending over can be seen everywhere. This was first initiated by special-class labor models Chen Haitao and Lai Wu. After the labor competition was launched, Chen Haitao's team walked quickly with full loads, but the work efficiency was always limited. What should they do? Everyone was worried about this matter. At this time, Lai Wu remembered that he had seen the People's Liberation Army using live hooks to carry soil in Hainan Island, but he couldn't remember how the live hooks were made. Chen Haitao tried to make it himself, and after many improvements, he finally succeeded. Using this live hook to dump soil, you only need to flip the basket forward, and the soil will pour out. Dumping a load of soil with a live hook is ten steps faster than dumping with a dead hook. With the attention and support of the Party committees at all levels, the "live hook dumping method" was quickly promoted from the entire squad, brigade, corps to the entire work area. The vast number of migrant workers improved various live hooks on this basis, totaling more than a dozen types.
    The efficiency of the carrying workers has been improved, but the tamping workers can't keep up. At this time, a young tamping worker group leader, Yu Qingming, began to think hard. Every day, while tamping, he carefully observed the movements of everyone when tamping. He led everyone to hold meetings to study technology again and again. On rainy days when they couldn't go to work, they sat on the bed, spread out the quilt, and used a wooden bowl as a tamping tool, and experimented one by one. They kept experimenting and improving, and they created a set of advanced operating methods - the "fast tamping method." The efficiency of a tamping increased from more than 200 square meters per day to 1,450 square meters, more than twice the national tamping quota (440 square meters per day for one tamping). At the same time, mountain area migrant workers Su Shichuan, Zhu Changchun and Cheng Renjie, who had never done tamping before, successively created new tamping methods, which not only improved the efficiency of tamping workers and reduced the number of tamping workers, but also ensured the quality of the project.
    Due to the creation and promotion of advanced methods, work efficiency has been generally improved. The average labor group carries more than seven cubic meters of soil per person per day. The average efficiency of the entire work area has gradually increased from about one cubic meter to more than two cubic meters. The average efficiency of most corps has been maintained at more than three cubic meters for a long time.
    After more than four months of hard work, the entire project was declared completed on April 15. Here, a total of 4,710 kilometers of new and repaired long dikes were built, and 62 river mouths were blocked, with a total earthwork of more than 86 million cubic meters. If these earthworks were used to build a long ridge one meter high and one meter wide, it could circle the earth nearly two times. In addition, in order to eliminate waterlogging, seven large and medium-sized culvert gates and eighteen small stone culverts were newly built. The completion of the entire project greatly reduced the interference and support of the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers, expanded the effective flood storage capacity by 6.26 billion cubic meters, shortened the flood control dike line by 950 kilometers, and increased the cultivated area by 300,000 mu. From then on, the six million mu of good farmland in the Dongting Lake area can safely produce under the flood level in 1949; the dikes of the three work areas of West Dongting, South Dongting, and Datong Lake, which have been focused on repairs, can ensure that two million mu of enclosure farmland will not be waterlogged or less waterlogged even if they encounter the same floods as in 1954. These achievements have provided a strong guarantee for agricultural production along the lake and laid a good foundation for gradually eradicating the Dongting Lake water disaster.
    Now, we can see that the bronze-colored dikes surround the West Dongting, South Dongting, and Datong Lake areas like city walls. Within the large circle of the new dike, there is a tense scene of spring plowing.
    When spring is warm and flowers are blooming, the protective forest on the dike of Dongting Lake Plain is shaded by green leaves. The beautiful patterns of "Long Live the Communist Party!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and pentagrams, doves of peace, etc., which are carefully and meticulously stitched with root grass on the newly built dike, are particularly verdant and lovely. People will use their hard work to sow the seeds of happiness in the first spring after the dike repair.

    修复洞庭湖区“祖国粮仓”的人们
    曾谷　舒胥一
    洞庭湖，这是一个多么令人向往的地方。从古以来，它就曾为人们留下过许多动人的诗篇和神话。如今，在这个全国最大的淡水湖边，一片沃野千里的平原拥抱着它。人们把这块美丽富饶的土地，亲切地称为“祖国粮仓”和“鱼米之乡”。在滨湖六百万亩肥沃的土地上，每年可以出产稻谷四十多亿斤，棉花三十五万担。
    可是，由于长江四口（藕池、松滋、太平、调弦）和湘、资、沅、澧四水，年复一年地挟带着大量泥沙入湖，使湖床日渐淤高，造成水系紊乱、互相干扰顶托的局面。历代反动统治者从不认真修治，以致堤垸荒废，常常发生水灾。一九五四年夏季，洞庭湖区又遭遇了百年来所未有的洪水。
    为了帮助湖区人民恢复生产，重建家园，一九五四年夏天，党和人民政府一面领导滨湖人民日夜同洪水进行顽强的搏斗，一面就着手进行洞庭湖堤垸修复工程的筹划工作。这一次修复工程根据中央指示和洞庭湖目前情况，采取了重点整修，医治创伤，清除隐患，险堤加固，有计划地并流堵口，合修大圈，争取农业丰收的方针。这个方针做到了治本和治标相结合，防洪和排渍并重，既满足了洞庭湖区人民当前恢复生产的迫切的要求，又符合于根治洞庭湖水患的长远计划。
    湖区人民衷心地拥护这个方针，全省、全国人民都支持这一规模巨大的建设工程。从去年十月起，东北的钢筋，上海、武汉的水泥，内蒙古的苞菜，四川的榨菜，贵州的大米……七十多万吨治湖物资，就开始从全国、全省各地，源源地运到了工地；八十五万民工、工人、干部、医生、教师、学生……从四面八方涌向洞庭湖。人们在修复“祖国粮仓”的号召下，纷纷参加治湖工作。
    十一月，咆哮的湖水开始收敛起汹涌的浪头，从曾经肆意蹂躏过的堤垸里退了出来。人们占据了洪水退出的阵地，搭起了连营千里的工棚。十二月一日，湖南省洞庭湖堤垸修复工程指挥部发出开工命令，八十五万劳动大军的英勇战斗开始了。
    开工不久，工地上就遭遇到一九五四年第二次寒流的侵袭。在南方，像这样的大冰冻是很少有的：气温从摄氏二十度骤然下降到零下八至十二度，湖上结成了厚冰，四通八达的电线结上了酒杯粗的冰凌。在这样冰冻十多天的日子里，民工们依然坚持了出工，喊出了“要雪堤脱衣，要冰河让路”的豪语。他们披着结成了一层薄冰的衣帽，冒着凛冽的寒风和纷飞的大雪，撬开近一公尺厚的坚冰，取出了一百六十多万公方泥土，送上堤岸；他们还在寒冷刺骨的急流里，堵死了六处大小河口。十二月二十六日在岩汪湖堵口工程中，青年团员童长根已经在工地劳动一整天了，他连回工棚去喝一口水的时间都不愿耽搁，口渴了，顺手抓起地上的积雪或者是路旁的冰凌塞在嘴里，匆匆地又挑着担子飞跑前去了。被称为“勇敢的人”的青年民工童海棠，在那满铺着冰块的进土道路上奔跑，一双草鞋磨穿了，又换上第二双，快到收工时，第二双草鞋也磨穿了，他索性打着赤脚走。就是这样，他们以超过原计划多挑两倍以上的土方，在二十三个昼夜里堵死了这支宽达一百五十公尺的急流。像这样动人的事迹是难以枚举的。工地上人人都知道堵口英雄唐泽模。当下麻河口堵口工程快要合龙的时候，他带头跳下冰冷的深水，双手紧握柳枝靠在自己的腰上，来减低流水的速度，好让别的民工顺利地进土；在这样的天气里跳下水去，他不是一次，而是二次，三次。就是他们，凭着火样的劳动热情，战胜了一次又一次的严寒风雪。
    继冰雪而来的是连绵的春雨。在雨天，人们同泥泞争夺道路，同春水争夺土场。宁乡总队四大队二中队的民工冒雨出工，衣服全都被打得透湿了，但是一个人也不肯退阵。共产党员成福生说得好：“英雄黄继光曾经在枪林弹雨里出入，难道我们还怕这小小的雨点？”是的，他们的坚强斗志足以惊慑暴雨狂风。在牛屎湖边，民工们曾经六次从七、八级狂风中抢住了围水堤。二月十八日的黑夜里，七级狂风掀起了牛屎湖浑浊的水浪，足足有一人多高，一个接着一个向堤身猛扑过来。常德三总队十四大队六中队的民工，都冒着风雨赶来保堤，头上带的?笠，被风刮到水里去了，身上披的蓑衣，也被风把绳子吹断了，人们的嘴巴只能紧闭着，逼得连吐气都感困难。堤上被水淋得泥深路滑，民工们跌倒了又爬起来，纷纷挑土、拖芦柴来加固堤身。在最紧急的时候，许多人跳下水去，以身挡浪，打桩护堤，水涨多高，堤筑多高。当他们奋战一夜之后，风停浪息，湖面涌出一轮红日时，望着那一片安然无恙的土场，不禁欢呼起来了。
    在几十处堵口、穿湖筑堤的难工中，民工们更表现了无比的英雄气概。有名的沅水洪道小港堵口工程，河宽六百余公尺，水深十二公尺，下边还有四公尺深的淤泥，水的流量在平时都达四百秒公方。当这个大河口堵口合龙的时候，青年团员张东成等抱着草包跳到水里，不管巨浪把他们冲得来往翻腾，浑浊的泥水从他们口里呛进，但他们终于把草包稳稳地踩住，在水中筑起了一道“人墙”，让一个一个草包叠成了拦水坝，终于把小港的河口堵死了。穿湖筑堤工程的塌陷十分严重。但是，民工们坚决表示：“堤塌心不塌！它塌一尺，我们就填一丈”。民康湖、光塘湖等地，前后塌陷两百多次。民工们以他们的铁扁担和硬肩膀，终于劈开湖心，筑起了一道雄伟的大堤。这些难工塌陷的土方，共达一千三百多万公方。如果把它用来筑成一条三尺高、二丈四尺宽的公路，就可以从长沙一直伸展到北京。
    在工程进行中，人们不仅付出了艰苦的劳动，而且发挥了集体智慧和创造才能。全工区曾展开劳动竞赛，掀起合理化建议运动的高潮。建闸工人，挑工，挖工，检踩工，硪工以至于炊事员，都开动脑筋找窍门，创造了许多先进工具和成套的先进操作方法。
    在工地的各个堤段上，到处可以看到民工们倒土不放箢箕不弯腰的“活钩倒土法”。这是特等劳动模范陈海涛和赖武首先倡导的。当劳动竞赛开展以后，陈海涛小组都满挑快走，但工效总提高得有限，怎么办呢？大家都为着这件事情着急。这时候，赖武想起了他在海南岛看到解放军挑土用的活钩，可是这活钩是怎么做的，却再也想不起来了。陈海涛就自己动手试制，经过多次改进，终于成功了。采用这活钩倒土，只要把箢箕向前一掀，土就倾出了，倒一担土比死钩倒土要快十步。在各级党委的重视和支持下，“活钩倒土法”很快地就由全中队、大队、总队而推广到了全工区。广大民工在这一基础上改进的各种活钩，为数共达十余种之多。
    挑土工工效提高了，硪工们却老赶不上。这时候，一个年轻的硪工组长余清明，就苦苦地思虑起来了。每天，他一边打硪就一边留神地观察着大家打硪时的动作。他一次又一次领着大家开会钻研技术。大雨天不能出工，他们就坐在床上摊开被子，拿个木碗当作抬硪，一下一下的试验。就这样不断地试验，不断地改进，他们创造出了一套先进的操作方法——“快速打硪法”。使一个硪的工效由一天打二百多平方公尺一直上升到一千四百五十平方公尺，超过全国硪工定额（一硪一天打四百四十平方公尺）两倍多。同在这个时候从没打过硪的山区民工苏世传朱长春和成仁杰等人，都先后创造了新的打硪法，不但提高了硪工工效，减少了硪工人数，而且保证了工程质量。
    由于先进方法的创造和推广，工作效率普遍提高。一般的劳动小组每天每人平均挑土七公方以上。全工区平均工效也由一公方左右逐渐上升到二公方以上。多数总队平均工效长时期地保持三公方以上。
    经过四个多月来的艰苦奋斗，全部工程在四月十五日宣告完工了。这里，一共新筑和培修了长堤四千七百一十公里，堵死河口六十二处，计土方八千六百多万公方。这些土方如果用来修成一公尺高一公尺宽的长埂，就可以环绕地球将近两周。此外，为了排除渍水，还新建了七座大、中型涵闸和十八座小型石涵。全部工程的完成，大大减轻了湘、资、沅、澧四水尾闾水系的干扰顶托，扩大了有效蓄洪容量六十二亿六千万立公方，缩短了防汛堤线九百五十公里，还增加了三十万亩耕地面积。从此，洞庭湖区六百万亩良田在一九四九年的洪水位下，可以安全生产；重点整修的西洞庭、南洞庭、大通湖三个工区堤垸，即使遭遇到一九五四年同样的洪水，也可以保证二百万亩垸田不渍或少渍。这些成就，已为滨湖农业生产提供了有力的保证，为逐步根治洞庭湖水患奠定了良好的基础。
    现在，我们可以看到：古铜色的大堤像城墙一样地环抱着西洞庭、南洞庭和大通湖区。在新堤的大圈内，呈现着一片紧张的春耕景象。
    春暖花开，洞庭湖平原上临湖大堤的防浪林绿叶成荫。人们在新修大堤上用扒根草精心细致地缀成的“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”和五角星、和平鸽等美丽的图案，分外翠绿可爱。人们要用自己的辛勤劳动，在这堤垸修复后的第一个春天里，播种下幸福的种子。
