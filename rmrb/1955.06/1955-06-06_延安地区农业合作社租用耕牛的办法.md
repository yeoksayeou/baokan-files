    Methods for Agricultural Cooperatives in the Yan'an Area to Rent Oxen
    Li Ruobin
    Since the winter of 1954, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the Yan'an area has increased from 79 to 1,166, and the number of households joining the cooperatives has increased from 0.67 percent of the total number of farm households to 16.64 percent. In this area, agricultural cooperatives have developed relatively quickly, and some shortcomings have occurred in individual local work; however, on the whole, the movement is healthy, the mood of cooperative members and non-cooperative farmers is normal, and their enthusiasm for production is higher than in previous years.

    There are many reasons why the production enthusiasm of the masses inside and outside the cooperatives in the Yan'an area is relatively good; the proper handling of farmers' oxen during the establishment of cooperatives is an important reason.

    The Yan'an area has many mountains, and the main power for farming is oxen. When farmers join the cooperative, they are more concerned about how to handle the oxen than how to handle land and other means of production. Among the existing thousand-plus cooperatives, only a few cooperatives in a few counties (some of which are old cooperatives) adopt the method of converting the price into shares (maintaining capital and value) or converting the price to the cooperative for privately owned oxen; most cooperatives adopt the method of private renting, according to the current level of awareness of farmers and local customs. There are different specific practices for renting in various places, which can be roughly divided into the following types:

    The first is the "fixed rent system." According to the size of the ox's teeth, physical strength, farming ability, good or bad temper, etc., the cooperative members jointly discuss and assess the annual rent of each ox, and pay the remuneration after the autumn harvest.

    The second is "quota allocation." According to the percentage of the total amount of ox rent used by other old cooperatives in the vicinity in one year, which accounts for the total amount of normal yield of land in the whole cooperative, or according to the percentage of the total amount of ox rent paid by the cooperative last year, which accounts for the total amount of normal yield of land in the whole cooperative, a considerable proportion of the yield is drawn out as the total ox rent of the whole cooperative. First, set the quota for the amount of work an ox should do in a day. After the ox has done the work every day, record how much the quota each ox has completed that day; when settling accounts after the autumn harvest, allocate the rent according to the amount of quota completed by each ox.

    The third is "fixed rent, flexible payment." First, assess the rent of each ox according to the first method, and then add up all the ox rents of the cooperative to calculate the total ox rent of the cooperative. The method of rent allocation is the same as the second method.

    The fourth is "grading and actual calculation." According to the ox's physical condition, teeth, farming ability, and other conditions, the oxen are divided into three grades: upper, middle, and lower, and the rent for each grade of oxen is assessed as a general standard. Then, according to the needs of the cooperative's production plan, determine the number of each grade of oxen that should be used throughout the year. Usually, oxen are used according to grade and recorded in a ledger, and accounts are settled after the autumn harvest. If the original planned usage amount is reached, the original assessed rent will be paid; if the original planned usage amount is exceeded, the excess amount will increase the rent; if it is insufficient, the rent will be reduced in the same way.

    The first method is relatively simple and easy to implement, suitable for local customs, and easily accepted by farmers, so it is adopted by most agricultural cooperatives. But it has shortcomings. The main shortcoming is that some cooperative members believe that "no matter how much or how well they do, it is still the same rent," so they are unwilling to use their oxen more, for fear of pulling too hard. This will hinder the more extensive land processing within the cooperative.

    The second and third methods are based on how much the oxen are used to get remuneration, which can eliminate the above-mentioned concerns of cooperative members; however, from the perspective of the entire cooperative, the total rent is fixed; the more work the oxen do in the whole cooperative, the lower the remuneration for each quota; especially the practice of estimating the total rent in the second method is inappropriate (because the number and quality of oxen and land occupied by each cooperative are different, and the situation of a cooperative last year is also different from the situation this year, calculating the cooperative this year based on other cooperatives, and calculating this year based on last year, will lead to overestimation or underestimation, hindering the enthusiasm of cooperative members to add good livestock), and it is not advisable to promote it.

    The fourth method is more detailed and reasonable, and can be combined with the agricultural cooperative's requirements for increased production, which can play a certain role in ensuring the completion of the production plan. Using more livestock to do work will increase the remuneration that livestock should receive, and cooperative members who have livestock will be willing to let the cooperative use livestock for more land processing according to the needs of production; in the case of a shortage of livestock, it can further improve the enthusiasm of cooperative members to purchase good livestock. This method is more complicated; it is not easy to do well for newly established cooperatives without certain production management experience. After a period of collective production, cooperatives whose backbone and cooperative members have certain experience in leading production and business management, and can formulate a production plan that is more in line with reality, can implement it.

    What should be done to feed and manage oxen if the method of renting oxen is adopted? This is also a very important issue. Most cooperatives in the Yan'an area adopt the method of feeding by each household, and a small number of cooperatives adopt the method of centralized feeding. Judging from the current situation, it is generally better to adopt the former method when the cooperative is first established. Because, when the cooperative is first established, the conditions for collective feeding, such as sheds, feeders, and forage, are not yet available. Forcing centralized feeding is likely to cause the phenomenon of livestock losing weight or even dying, causing great losses to the production of the cooperative and the interests of the cooperative members. After the Jijin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qiqu Sixiang, Yan'an County, was established in the winter of 1954, it immediately concentrated 29 oxen in three places for centralized feeding; because the feeding management was poor and the forage was insufficient, the oxen generally lost weight and were exhausted. During the spring plowing, an ox could only plow a little more than one mu of land a day, which was nearly half lower than the farming efficiency in previous years. The Zhao Jia'an Agricultural Cooperative, which is only separated from this cooperative by a small river, was also established at the same time, and the oxen were still fed by each household; although there was also a shortage of forage, because the livestock owners could understand the temperaments of the livestock and were more careful, leftover rice and pot washing water that people could not eat were fed to the livestock, and they actively tried to solve the problem of forage. The cooperative also uniformly adjusted and subsidized some, so the livestock were well fed and did not lose weight. The donkeys and horses of Jijin Cooperative were not fed centrally like oxen, but adopted the method of temporary rent, and they were generally well fed and did not lose weight.

    Although the methods of renting oxen by various agricultural production cooperatives in the Yan'an area are different, there is a common feature - the rent of oxen is generally slightly lower than the local social livestock rent in the past. This is because there were many households lacking oxen in the past, and households with oxen pursued excessive profits, so the social rent was generally high; in recent years, the number of households without oxen has been greatly reduced, and there are very few people renting oxen. At the same time, renting oxen from cooperative members within the cooperative is fundamentally different from the general social relationship of renting oxen. In the past, when oxen were rented to others, the ox owner only got the ox rent and could not use it himself; now, after the cooperative member gets the ox rent, he can still use the ox to cultivate on his own share of land, and he can also get a larger share if the cooperative increases production. Therefore, the masses believe that this is more reasonable. Of course, the rent should not be too low. Generally speaking, in addition to the appropriate remuneration for feeding livestock, forage, and required labor, the livestock owner should also have a certain income. (If the cooperative is responsible for centralized feeding, the rent should naturally be reduced reasonably.)

    延安地区农业合作社租用耕牛的办法
    李若彬
    一九五四年冬季以来，延安地区的农业生产合作社由七十九个发展到了一千一百六十六个，入社户数由占总农户的百分之零点六七增加到百分之十六点六四。在这个地区，农业社发展得比较快，个别地方工作中也发生了一些缺点；但是，总的看来，运动是健康的，社员和社外农民的情绪正常，生产积极性比往年高。
    延安地区社内外群众生产情绪比较好的原因是多方面的；在办社当中对农民的耕牛处理得恰当，是重要原因之一。
    延安地区山地多，耕作的主要动力是牛。农民在入社时，对耕牛如何处理比对土地和其他生产资料的处理更为关心。现有的一千多个社，对农民私有的耕牛，只有少数县的部分社（其中一部分是老社）采用折价存社（保本保值）或折价归社的办法；大多数社是按目前农民觉悟水平和当地群众习惯，采取私有租用的办法。各地在租用的具体做法上又有所不同，大致可分以下几种：
    第一种是“死租制”。按牛的口齿大小、体质强弱、耕作能力、脾气好坏等等，由社员公议评定每犋牛的全年租额，秋后付给报酬。
    第二种是“定额分配”。按附近其他老社一年所用牛租总额所占全社土地常年产量总额的百分数，或按本社上年所付牛租总额占全社土地常年产量总额的百分数，抽出相当比例的产量，作为全社耕牛总租额。使用耕牛一天应做多少工作，先定出耕作数量质量的定额。每天用耕牛做了工作以后，把每犋牛当天完成定额多少记下来；秋收后算账时，按用各犋牛完成定额的多少分配租额。
    第三种是“死租活给”。先按第一种办法评出每犋牛的租额，然后把全社所有牛租加起来算作全社的牛租总额。租额的分配办法和第二种办法相同。
    第四种是“分等实算”。按牛的体质、口齿、耕作能力等条件把牛分为上中下三等，评出各等牛的租额，作为大体标准。再根据社的生产计划要求所需要的畜力，定出各等牛全年应使用的数量。平时用牛分等按活记账，秋后结账。达到原定使用数量的，照付原评租额；超过原定使用数量的，超过的数量增加租额；不足的，按同样办法减少租额。
    第一种比较简单易行，适合当地群众的习惯，农民容易接受，所以为多数农业社所采用。但它是有缺点的。主要的缺点是有些社员认为“反正做得再多、再好，还是那些租子”，因而不愿多使用自己的牛，怕曳的重了。这就会妨碍社内更多地进行土地加工。
    第二三两种办法是按耕牛被使用的多少得到报酬，能消除社员上述疑虑；但是，从全社范围来看，总租额是固定的；全社使用耕牛做活越多，则每个定额的报酬越低；特别是第二种办法中估计总租额的做法不妥当（因为各社占有耕牛、土地的数量质量不同，一个社去年的情况和今年的情况也有所不同，按其他社的计算本社的，按去年的计算今年的，都会发生偏高或偏低的现象，妨碍社员添置好牲口的积极性），不宜提倡。
    第四种办法比较细致，也比较合理，能同农业社的增产要求结合起来，对于保证生产计划的完成，可以起一定的作用。多用耕畜做活，就增加牲畜应得报酬，有耕畜的社员们就愿意社里根据生产的需要使用耕畜进行更多的土地加工；在缺少耕畜的情况下，更能提高社员添购好耕畜的积极性。这种办法比较复杂；初办的社，没有一定的生产管理经验，不容易做好。经过了一个时期的集体生产，社的骨干和社员有了一定的领导生产和经营管理的经验，并且能订出比较切合实际的生产计划的社，都可以实行。
    对耕牛采取租用的办法，应当怎样饲养管理呢？这也是很重要的问题。延安地区多数社采用各户饲养的办法，少部分社采用集中饲养的办法。从目前情况看，社初办时，一般以采取前一种办法为好。因为，在初办社的时候，集体饲养的棚圈、饲养员、草料等条件尚不具备，勉强集中喂养，很容易发生牲口落膘甚至死亡的现象，给社的生产和社员的利益造成很大的损失。延安县七区四乡集进农业生产合作社一九五四年冬成立以后，立即把二十九头耕牛分三处集中喂养；因为饲养管理差，草料也不够，所以耕牛普遍落膘、累乏，春耕中一犋牛一天只能犁一亩稍多点地，比往年耕作效率减低将近一半。同这个社只隔一条小河的赵家岸农业社也是同时成立的，耕牛仍归各户喂养；虽然草料也缺，但因畜主能摸着牲畜的脾性，也比较爱惜，人不能吃的剩饭和洗锅水都喂了牲口，并且积极设法解决草料问题，社内还统一调剂补助了一些，所以牲口都喂得好，没有落膘现象。集进社的驴和马，不像耕牛那样集中喂养，而是采用临时租用办法，一般也都喂得很好，没有瘦下去的。
    延安地区各个农业生产合作社租用耕牛的办法虽有所不同，但是有一个共同的特点——牛的租额一般都略低于过去当地社会畜租。这是因为过去当地缺牛户多，有牛户追求过高的利润，社会租额一般偏高；近几年无牛户大为减少，租牛的人已经很少。同时，社内租用社员的牛也同社会上一般的租牛关系根本不同。过去把牛租给别人，牛主只得牛租，自己不能使用；现在社员得了牛租后，在自己的一份土地上仍然可以用牛耕作，社内增产了自己也能多分。因此，群众认为这样是比较合理的。当然，租额也不能太低，一般地说，畜主所得的租额，除了喂养牲口草料和所需人工的适当报酬外，还应当有一定的收益。（由社负责集中喂养的，租额自然应当合理减低。）
