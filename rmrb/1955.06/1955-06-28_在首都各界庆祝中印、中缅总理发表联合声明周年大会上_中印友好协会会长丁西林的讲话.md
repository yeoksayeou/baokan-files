Esteemed Ambassadors, Dear Friends and Comrades:

    Today, the Sino-Indian Friendship Association and the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association jointly hold this meeting to celebrate the first anniversary of the Joint Statement issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma, and to celebrate the brilliant achievements made in the past year in enhancing friendly relations between China and India and Burma based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    In June 1954, when the people of Asia and the world were watching the development of the Geneva Conference and the Far East situation, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country, at the invitation of the governments of India and Burma, our great neighbors, successively visited the Republic of India and the Union of Burma. On June 28th and 29th, he issued joint statements with Prime Minister Nehru and Prime Minister U Nu in Delhi and Rangoon respectively, stipulating the five principles guiding the relations between China and India and between China and Burma. These principles are: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual non-aggression; mutual non-interference in internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence. These principles not only meet the requirements of the people of China, India, and Burma, but also provide a basis for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Therefore, they were immediately wholeheartedly supported by the people of our three countries and praised and supported by all peace-loving countries and peoples.

    In the past year, under the guidance of the Five Principles, friendly cooperation between our country and India and Burma has developed rapidly in the political, economic, and cultural fields. In particular, the successive visits of Prime Minister Nehru and Prime Minister U Nu to our country last October and last December were of great significance for enhancing mutual understanding and trust between the governments and peoples of our country and India and Burma.

    It is necessary to point out that the Five Principles announced in the Joint Statement of the Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma are playing an increasingly active role in international affairs in Asia and the world. The Ten Principles announced at the Bandung Conference of twenty-nine countries in Asia and Africa in April this year are precisely an extension and development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. After the Prime Ministers of China and Indonesia visited each other and issued a joint statement this year, the friendly relations between the two countries have been further developed. The recent declarations of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments, as well as the joint statement of Chairman Bulganin and Prime Minister Nehru, also fully embody the spirit and essence of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and have made a major contribution to easing international tensions. Facts have proved that, whether in the East or the West, the demand for peaceful coexistence has gradually taken root in the hearts of the people, while aggressors and colonialists who oppose peace and frantically expand their arms race are increasingly isolated. We firmly believe that, with the joint efforts of India, Burma, Indonesia, China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries, and with the joint efforts of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, lasting peace in the Far East and the world can be achieved.

    In order to fully implement the Five Principles announced in the Joint Statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma, to further develop the friendly cooperation between China and India and China and Burma, and to defend peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese people will join hands with the Indian people, the Burmese people, and all peace-loving people to advance together.

    Long live Sino-Indian friendship!

    Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

    Long live world peace!

    在首都各界庆祝中印、中缅总理发表联合声明周年大会上
    中印友好协会会长丁西林的讲话尊敬的大使先生们亲爱的朋友们和同志们：
    今天中印友好协会和中缅友好协会联合举行这个大会，庆祝中印、中缅总理发表联合声明一周年，并庆祝一年以来，中国同印度、缅甸根据和平共处的五项原则增进友好关系中所获得的光辉成就。
    一九五四年六月，当亚洲和世界人民都在注视着日内瓦会议和远东局势的发展时，我国周恩来总理应印度政府和缅甸政府的邀请，先后访问了我们伟大的邻邦印度共和国和缅甸联邦，并同尼赫鲁总理和吴努总理在六月二十八日和二十九日，在德里和仰光分别发表联合声明，规定了指导中印两国之间和中缅两国之间的关系的五项原则，这些原则是：互相尊重主权和领土完整；互不侵犯；互不干涉内政；平等互利；和平共处。这些原则不仅符合中国、印度、缅甸三国人民的要求，而且为不同社会制度的国家之间的和平共处提供了基础，因此它立即受到我们三国人民的衷心拥护，并为所有爱好和平的国家和人民所赞许和支持。
    过去一年中，在五项原则的指导之下，我国同印度、缅甸的友好合作在政治、经济、文化各方面都有了迅速的发展；特别是去年十月和去年十二月尼赫鲁总理和吴努总理相继来我国访问，对于增进我国政府和人民同印度、缅甸政府和人民之间的相互了解和信任，有着重大的意义。
    有必要指出，中印、中缅总理联合声明所宣布的五项原则，在亚洲和世界范围的国际事务中正在起着愈来愈大的积极作用。今年四月亚非两洲二十九个国家在万隆会议上所宣布的十项原则，正是和平共处五项原则的引申和发展。中国和印度尼西亚两国总理，在今年互相访问并发表联合声明以后，两国间的友好关系有了更进一步的发展。最近苏联和南斯拉夫两国政府的宣言以及布尔加宁主席和尼赫鲁总理的联合声明，也充分体现了和平共处五项原则的精神和实质，对缓和国际紧张局势作了重大的贡献。事实证明，无论在东方或西方，和平共处的要求已逐渐深入人心，而反对和平、疯狂地扩军备战的侵略者和殖民主义者则日益陷于孤立。我们深信，在印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、中国、苏联和其他亚洲国家的共同努力下，在世界上所有的爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力下，远东和世界的持久和平是可以争取到的。
    为了完满地实践中印、中缅总理的联合声明所宣布的五项原则和进一步发展中印、中缅的友好合作，为了保卫亚洲和世界和平，中国人民将同印度人民、缅甸人民和一切爱好和平的人民一道携手前进。
    中印友好万岁！
    中缅友好万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
