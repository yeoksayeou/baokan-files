    Tenth Anniversary of the San Francisco Conference
    Dong Biwu
    This year marks the tenth anniversary of the San Francisco Conference. Ten years ago, on April 25, 1945, the international conference convened in San Francisco to draft the United Nations Charter. After two months of discussion, the United Nations Charter was adopted on June 26, 1945. At that time, I was appointed by the Chinese Communist Party as one of China's representatives and signed this solemn United Nations Charter.
    Ten years ago today, it was the time when the world's people's anti-fascist war was about to achieve its final victory. At that time, in the West, Hitler's Germany had been defeated, and many countries ravaged by fascism had been successively liberated; in the East, although Japanese imperialism was still struggling to its death, the war against Japan was also increasingly approaching victory. The victory of the world's people's anti-fascist war strengthened the confidence of the people of all countries in striving for democracy, and also made them realize the importance of the unity of democratic forces, and the painful sacrifices suffered by mankind in World War II also made them feel the necessity of maintaining world peace after the war. The San Francisco Conference was convened and successfully concluded under such circumstances where the people of the world fervently demanded democracy, unity, and peace.
    The United Nations Charter formulated at the San Francisco Conference clearly stipulates that the purposes of the United Nations are to maintain international peace and security and to develop friendly cooperation among nations; the principles that the United Nations should follow are sovereign equality of all countries, peaceful settlement of international disputes, non-violation of the territorial integrity or political independence of other countries, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
    Since the five major powers, China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, bear the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, the United Nations also established the principle of unanimity among the major powers in the Security Council. This principle provides effective guarantees for the peace and security of the people of all countries.
    The purposes and principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter are in line with the aspirations of the people of all countries to safeguard peace. Therefore, after the establishment of the United Nations, people all over the world sincerely hoped that the United Nations would truly become an effective organization for maintaining international justice and world peace and play its due role in international affairs. We Chinese people have suffered deeply from imperialist oppression for a century, and suffered profound disasters in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. We yearn for the extension of international justice and the lasting peace of the world, so we fully support the purposes and principles of the United Nations and place great expectations on the United Nations.
    Indeed, if the United Nations can truly be what the people of the world expect, then the United Nations will inevitably be able to make its due contribution in maintaining world peace and security and promoting peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among countries.
    Unfortunately, this is not the case. The fact is that, for the past ten years, the United Nations has not fulfilled its major responsibility of maintaining world peace and security. The history of the United Nations in the past ten years should be said to be unsatisfactory.
    No one can deny that the government and people of the Soviet Union made the greatest contribution in defeating world fascism, and after the end of the war, the Soviet Union made great efforts in the cause of maintaining peace. The Soviet Union played a major role in the establishment of the United Nations and the formulation of the United Nations Charter. It has consistently adhered to the principles of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation stipulated in the United Nations Charter, and has waged an unyielding struggle to safeguard these principles.
    However, certain members of the United Nations, especially the United States among the five major powers, have pursued policies that are completely contrary to the spirit of the United Nations Charter. After the people of the world went through arduous struggles and won the victory of the anti-fascist war, the US ruling clique has consistently pursued a policy of interference and aggression, attempting to dominate the world. In order to realize its ambition to dominate the world, the United States has spared no effort to undermine the United Nations, making it lose its role as a bastion of maintaining peace. On the other hand, it has manipulated the United Nations in many ways, using the United Nations as a tool for implementing its aggressive policies. The United States once waged a war of aggression against Korea in the name of the United Nations, which is the most prominent example. Similarly, due to the discrimination and obstruction of the United States, many countries in the world have not been accepted as members of the United Nations. This destruction and manipulation by the United States cannot but greatly damage the prestige of the United Nations, and at the same time greatly weaken the role that the United Nations can play in the cause of maintaining international peace and security.
    China is one of the founding members of the United Nations and one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. However, since the Chinese people overthrew imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule and established the People's Republic of China, due to the repeated obstruction by the United States in disregard of the wishes of the majority of member states, our China's legitimate status and rights in the United Nations have been illegally deprived and have not been restored to this day.
    Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a policy of peace. Over the past five years, the People's Republic of China has made great efforts and made considerable contributions to maintaining world peace and promoting international cooperation based on its peace policy. This is already a fact that is obvious to all. As an institution for maintaining international peace and as a center for coordinating the actions of all countries, the United Nations excludes a country with 600 million people who are committed to peace. This is an extremely unjust and unreasonable thing.
    Moreover, according to the United Nations Charter, the People's Republic of China, as one of the five major powers, has a special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Now, because its legitimate status and rights in the United Nations have been unreasonably deprived, the People's Republic of China cannot fulfill its due responsibilities, thereby undermining the important principle of unanimity among the major powers in the United Nations Security Council. This is a great loss to the cause of maintaining international peace, and it is also obvious.
    In order to humiliate the People's Republic of China, the United States has illegally manipulated the United Nations to pass resolutions that falsely accuse China of being an "aggressor" and impose an "embargo" on China. These illegal resolutions have poisoned the international atmosphere and hindered international trade relations, and are completely incompatible with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, these illegal resolutions of the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States, which humiliate the People's Republic of China, are also weakening the United Nations' own moral strength. This is also a recognized fact.
    Precisely because the exclusion of the People's Republic of China from the United Nations is so unrealistic and unreasonable, world public opinion has increasingly advocated that, in order to safeguard international justice and restore the prestige of the United Nations, this extremely abnormal phenomenon must be quickly corrected.
    Our People's Republic of China's policy of safeguarding peace is unwavering, and we have always supported the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. On this tenth anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Charter, we believe that the United Nations should truly become an effective international organization and play its due role in maintaining international peace and security. In order for the United Nations to function effectively, the various unreasonable phenomena we mentioned earlier should be changed quickly; the United Nations Charter should be respected by all countries; the legitimate status and rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored; many countries in the world that are eligible for membership should be accepted as members of the United Nations, so that the members of the United Nations have universality. Only in this way can the United Nations become a United Nations in name and in fact, and contribute to the great cause of maintaining world peace. This is the wish of our Chinese people. At the same time, I firmly believe that this is also the common wish of the people of all countries in the world.

### 旧金山会议十周年

    旧金山会议十周年
    董必武
    今年是旧金山会议的十周年纪念。十年以前，一九四五年四月二十五日，为了制定联合国宪章而召开的国际会议在旧金山举行。经过两个月的讨论，联合国宪章于一九四五年六月二十六日通过。当时，我为中国共产党所委派、作为中国的代表之一，也在这个庄严的联合国宪章上签了字。
    十年前的今天，正是世界人民反法西斯战争即将获得最后胜利的时候。那时，在西方，希特勒德国已经被击溃，许多备受法西斯蹂躏的国家已经相继获得了解放；在东方，日本帝国主义虽然还在作垂死的挣扎，但对日的作战也已日益接近胜利。世界人民反法西斯战争的胜利加强了世界各国人民争取民主的信心，也使他们认识到了民主力量团结的重要，而第二次世界大战使人类所遭受的惨痛牺牲也使他们痛感到战后维持世界和平的必要。旧金山会议正是在这样举世人民热烈要求民主、团结和和平的情况之下召开并胜利结束的。
    旧金山会议所制定的联合国宪章明确地规定，联合国的宗旨是维持国际和平和安全并发展国际间的友好合作；联合国所应遵行的原则是，各国主权平等，以和平方法解决国际争端，不得侵犯他国的领土完整或政治独立，并不得干涉他国的内政。
    由于中、苏、英、美、法五大国对维持国际和平和安全负有主要的责任，联合国还确定了安全理事会中大国一致的原则。这一原则使各国人民的和平和安全获得了有效的保障。
    联合国宪章所规定的这些宗旨和原则，是和世界各国人民维护和平的愿望相符合的。因此，联合国成立以后，全世界人民都恳切地希望，联合国真正成为一个维护国际正义和世界和平的有效的组织而在国际事务中发挥其应有的作用。我们中国人民一世纪来深受帝国主义压迫之苦，在八年的抗日战争中又遭受了深重的灾难，我们渴望国际正义之得以伸张，世界和平之得以持久，所以我们完全拥护联合国的宗旨和原则，并对联合国寄以很大的期望。
    的确，如果联合国真能像世界人民所期望的那样，那末联合国就必然能够在维护世界和平和安全、促进各国和平相处和友好合作方面作出它应有的贡献。
    可惜的是，事实并不是这样，事实是，十年来，联合国并没有尽到它维持世界和平和安全的重大责任，十年来的联合国历史应该说是不能令人满意的。
    谁都不能否认，苏联的政府和人民，在打败世界法西斯的战争中，曾经作了最大的贡献，而在战争结束以后，苏联又在维护和平的事业中尽了极大的努力。苏联对联合国的成立和联合国宪章的制定起了主要的作用，它一贯地遵守联合国宪章所规定的和平相处和国际合作的原则，并且为维护这些原则而不屈不挠地进行了斗争。
    但是，某些联合国会员国，特别是五大国之中的美国，却奉行着同联合国宪章的精神完全相违背的政策。在全世界人民经过了艰难困苦的奋斗而取得了反法西斯战争的胜利以后，美国统治集团却一贯奉行着干涉和侵略的政策，妄想独霸世界。为了实现它独霸世界的野心，美国不惜百般破坏联合国，使它失去作为保持和平的堡垒的作用，另一方面它又多方操纵联合国，利用联合国作为它实行侵略政策的工具。美国曾经假借联合国的名义进行侵略朝鲜的战争，这就是一个最显著的例子。同样也由于美国的歧视和阻挠，世界上许多国家还没有被接纳为联合国的会员国。美国这种破坏和操纵，不能不使联合国的威信大受损害，同时也就大大削弱了联合国在维持国际和平和安全的事业中所能起的作用。
    我们中国是联合国的创始会员国之一，并且是联合国安全理事会五个常任理事国中的一个。但是，自从中国人民推翻了帝国主义和蒋介石的反动统治、建立中华人民共和国以后，由于美国不顾大多数会员国的愿望而一再横加阻挠，我们中国在联合国中的合法地位和权利竟被非法地剥夺，至今没有得到恢复。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，一贯地奉行着和平政策。五年多来，中华人民共和国根据它的和平政策已经为维护世界和平和促进国际合作作了很大的努力，并且有了不小的贡献。这已经是有目共睹的事实。联合国作为一个维持国际和平的机构、作为一个协调各国行动的中心，而竟把一个拥有六亿人口的、致力于和平的国家排斥在外，这是一件极不公正、极不合理的事。
    况且，根据联合国宪章，中华人民共和国作为五大国之一，对维护国际和平和安全负有特殊的责任。现在，由于它在联合国中的合法地位和权利受到无理的剥夺，中华人民共和国竟无法尽它应尽的责任，从而使联合国安全理事会中大国一致的重要原则也遭到了破坏。这对于维护国际和平的事业是一种很大的损失，也是显而易见的。
    为了污辱中华人民共和国，美国曾经非法操纵联合国通过诬蔑中国为“侵略者”并对中国实施“禁运”的决议。这些非法的决议毒化了国际的气氛和阻碍了国际间的贸易关系，是完全和联合国宪章的精神不相容的。因此，联合国在美国操纵之下所通过的这些污辱中华人民共和国的非法的决议，同时也正削弱了联合国自己的道义力量。这也是公认的事实。
    正因为把中华人民共和国排斥在联合国之外这件事是这样的不现实和不合理，世界舆论已经日益主张，为了维护国际正义，为了恢复联合国的威信，这种极端反常的现象必须迅速加以纠正。
    我们中华人民共和国维护和平的政策是坚定不移的，我们一贯支持联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。在这纪念联合国宪章通过十周年的时候，我们认为，应该使联合国真正成为一个有效的国际组织而在维持国际和平和安全的事业中发挥它应有的作用。为了使联合国能够有效地进行工作，我们在前面所说的种种不合理的现象应该迅速有所改变；联合国宪章应该为所有的国家所尊重；中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位和权利应该加以恢复；世界上许多有会员国资格的国家应该被接纳为联合国会员国，以使联合国的成员国具有普遍性。必须这样，联合国才能成为名符其实的联合国，而对维持世界和平的伟大事业有所贡献。这是我们中国人民的愿望。同时，我深信，这也是世界各国人民所共有的愿望。
