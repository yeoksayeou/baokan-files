    "Entering the construction site, stepping on Renminbi, warehouses unattended, taking whatever is needed" – this situation on the construction site of the Henan Textile Bureau Engineering Company has now changed.

    Now, whether going to or leaving work, workers consciously pick up discarded iron wire, nails, pipe fittings, and steel scraps from the ground... and place them in the thrift box. Just as their doggerel says: "In the past, we walked with our heads up, not caring if we stepped on tools; now we walk with our eyes wide open, turning aside to pick up 'waste'." What is even more noteworthy is the youth thrift team active on the construction site. During their regular spare time, no matter how hot the weather, they always carry the large red flag, an honor given to them by the Party, and clean every corner of the construction site. The members of the construction team's youth thrift team once recovered a "painting machine" worth more than four hundred yuan. According to incomplete statistics, the company recovered more than 11,900 jin of scrap steel alone in May.

    Zhang Fenggang, the production team leader of this engineering company's lumber mill, initially thought that their factory did not waste much. But when he saw the youth thrift team collect more than a hundred jin of iron nails in just one morning, he said, "Things that are usually invisible, when accumulated together, are truly astonishing!" Another comrade said: "Precisely because we did not pay enough attention to thrift in the past ideologically, we unconsciously wasted state property." To make up for the losses caused in the past, workers have widely launched activities to utilize waste materials and old equipment to save funds for the country. The lumber mill collected more than 670 jin of iron nails, which were all used after processing; the tinplate picked up in the morning was used by the workers making scaffolding drill bits in the afternoon. Youth League members Zhao Wanxiang and Chu Entan also converted the three- or four-cun-long steel scraps they collected into sixty-five quarter-inch drill bits, which not only saved the country one hundred and ninety-five yuan but also ensured the timely supply of tools.

    The activities of the youth thrift team have educated every young employee, greatly strengthened their awareness of cherishing state property, and encouraged them to fight against all phenomena of waste and damage to state property. In the past, many family members of employees around the construction site often took public furniture and equipment for their own use, used gasoline drums as water tanks, converted iron water buckets into small coal stoves, and some even used wood from the construction site to start fires, but few people paid attention to these phenomena. Now it is different. One afternoon in May, young employee Zeng Xian-shuang saw three more family members of employees going to the construction site to take wood. He stepped forward to stop them and explained to them in detail that everyone should cherish state property and should not take state property for their own use. Some other employees nearby also came over to explain. Under everyone's persuasion, these few family members of employees finally put down the wood and returned home. Some workers in the mud worker Chen Tingxiu's team, when repairing houses for the family members of employees, not only actively did their work but also mobilized the family members of employees to return twenty-seven kinds of privately used company items such as water buckets, teapots, iron shovels, and gasoline drums, totaling one hundred and forty pieces.

    Through the exposure and criticism of wasteful behavior, everyone also realized that due to insufficient attention to thrift ideologically in the past, sloppy work, using large materials for small purposes, and violating labor discipline, the country suffered many losses. For this reason, many production teams have formulated responsibility systems and guarantee conditions, and are working in accordance with the spirit of practicing thrift and opposing waste. For example, the hand planer and universal planer youth teams of the lumber mill launched a "Zero Accident Month" campaign in May. Because they were able to conscientiously implement operating procedures and responsibility systems, they eliminated personal and project quality accidents throughout the month, avoiding rework and waste.

    厉行节约后的新气象
    杨鸿慈
      “走进大工地，脚踏人民币，仓库无人管，各取所需”——河南纺织管理局工程公司工地上的这种情况，现在已经有了改变了。
    现在不论上班和下班，工人都会自觉地拾起丢在地上的铁丝、铁钉、水管头、钢筋头……把它们放在节约箱里。正像他们作的打油诗所说：“过去走路仰着脸，脚踏工具也不管；现在走路瞪着眼，为拾‘浪费’把路转。”更引人注意的是活跃在工地上的青年节约队。他们在定期的业余时间里，不管天气多么炎热，总是扛着党给予他们的荣誉的大红旗，清理工地的每个角落。施工所青年节约队的队员曾清理出一部价值四百多元的“粉刷机”。据不完全的统计：全公司单废钢铁器材一项，在五月份就回收了一万一千九百多斤。
    这个工程公司木材加工厂生产组长张凤刚，起初还认为他们厂的浪费不大，当他见到青年节约队员仅在一个早晨便拾到一百多斤铁钉时，说：“平常看不见的东西，积到一块儿，可真惊人啊！”另一个同志说：“正因为我们过去在思想上对节约不够重视，所以就不知不觉地浪费了国家的财产。”为了弥补以前所造成的损失，工人中广泛展开了利用废料、旧器材为国家节约资金的活动。木材加工厂所拾到的六百七十多斤铁钉，经过加工，全部使用了；上午拾到的白铁皮，下午就被做脚手架钻头的工人用上了。青年团员赵万祥和楚恩潭，还把拾到的三、四公寸长的钢筋头，改制成四分钻头六十五只，这不仅为国家节约了一百九十五元，而且还保证了工具的及时供应。
    青年节约队的活动，教育了每个青年职工，大大加强了他们爱护国家财产的观念，鼓舞他们向一切浪费和损害国家财产的现象展开斗争。过去工地周围不少职工家属，经常把公家的家具、器材占为己有，把汽油桶当作水缸，把铁水桶改制成小煤火炉，甚至有的人家用工地的木材生火，但是这些现象很少有人过问。现在不同了，五月份的一天下午，青年职员曾宪双看见又有三个职工家属到工地去拿木材，他便向前阻止她们，详细地向她们解释：人人都应该爱护国家财产，更不应该私自拿走国家的东西。在旁的另一些职工也过来解释。在大家说服动员之下，这几个职工家属终于放下木材，回去了。泥工陈廷秀小组的有些工人，在为职工家属修补房子时，不仅积极作好工作，而且还动员职工家属交回了私自动用公司的水桶、茶壶、铁锹、汽油桶等器具二十七种，共一百四十件。
    经过对浪费行为的揭发和批判，大家还认识到由于过去在思想上对节约重视不够，工作粗枝大叶，大材小用，违犯劳动纪律，给国家造成了不少损失。为此，不少生产小组都制定了责任制度和保证条件，根据厉行节约、反对浪费的精神进行工作。如木材加工厂手压刨、万能刨两个青年小组，五月份开展了“杜绝事故月”的活动，由于他们能认真执行操作规程和责任制度，全月消灭了人身和工程质量事故，避免了返工浪费。
