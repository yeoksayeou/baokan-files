Xi'an Successfully Trials Czechoslovakian-Style Harvester

    The Xi'an Agricultural Implement Research Institute successfully trial-produced the first batch of Czechoslovakian-style animal-drawn harvesters in early May. After field trials, their performance was proven to be good.

    This type of harvester is relatively light and the cost is also lower. Recent trials in Wugong, Shaanxi Province, and other places, showed that one person can drive it, using two medium-sized animals to pull it, and it can harvest more than six mu of wheat per hour on average. During the trial process, this harvester was welcomed by the farmers. (Wang Jiankun)

    西安试制捷式收割机成功
    西安农具研究所在五月上旬试制出第一批捷克斯洛伐克式的畜力收割机，经过实地试验，证明性能良好。
    这种收割机比较轻巧，成本也较低。最近在陕西省武功等地试验，由一人驾驶，用两头中等牲口牵引，平均每小时可以收割小麦六亩以上。在试验过程中，这种收割机受到了农民的欢迎。（王建坤）
