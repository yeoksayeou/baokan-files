Saving Copper
    Lǐ Shèngtíng

    Copper is an essential material for industrial production. Although China has abundant copper mineral resources, production is still relatively low. Especially with the rapid development of national construction, the demand for copper is increasing day by day, and production is far from keeping up with demand. Therefore, saving copper and widely promoting copper substitutes are of great significance.

    In the past, various regions have achieved considerable results in saving copper. In 1954, Beijing successfully trial-produced more than 100 new products that substituted iron for copper. If these new products were fully promoted in Beijing, more than 470 tons of copper could be saved annually. Shenyang successfully trial-produced 23 types of water and heating equipment that substituted iron for copper, saving 2,000 tons of copper in half a year. Tianjin successfully trial-produced 24 types of fire-fighting equipment that substituted iron for copper, saving more than 930 tons of copper. Shanghai has initially carried out the work of saving copper, saving the country 4,000 to 5,000 tons of copper. These new products fully meet quality requirements, are strong and durable, and can be used in buildings with high equipment requirements. Some factories in Tianjin once conducted tensile tests on malleable iron and brass, and the results showed that the tensile strength of a one-centimeter-thick malleable iron pipe was 30 kilograms, while the tensile strength of a brass pipe was only 13 kilograms. From this, it can be seen that the quality of malleable iron pipes is higher than that of copper pipes, but the cost of malleable iron castings is two-thirds lower than that of brass castings.

    However, to this day, there are still many factories that manufacture copper products that do not pay attention to the issue of saving copper. They believe, "Let us make copper products now, and we'll talk about it when we're not allowed to anymore." Obviously, this attitude is incorrect. Saving copper and using copper substitutes to manufacture products is a policy put forward by the state to copper product factories. The reason why we are not universally prohibiting the production of copper products today is simply to allow these factories time to explore experience in the use of substitutes. Waiting and watching is an irresponsible behavior towards saving important national materials.

    Some factories are afraid that new products made of iron instead of copper will not sell, and are not actively trying to produce them. This concern is unnecessary. With the development of the conservation movement, the sales of products made of iron instead of copper will greatly increase. In the future, it may not be products made of iron instead of copper that will not sell, but copper products. As for the fact that some units are unwilling to purchase products made of iron instead of copper, more explanations should be given, and they should be persuaded from a positive perspective.

    There are also some user units, especially construction units, that have resistance to using copper substitutes. They emphasize that only copper decorations are considered elegant and beautiful, so the stair treads, door handles, corner protectors, door push plates, and hinges of buildings must be made of copper. If they cannot buy them locally, they do not hesitate to travel a long distance to buy them from other places. This is an obvious waste of resources. Because the use of copper substitutes does not have any adverse effects on the applicability, economy, or even aesthetics of the building, what reason is there to refuse to adopt them?

    Saving copper is an arduous and complex task. There are many factories that manufacture copper products and many units that use copper products, involving a wide range of areas. All relevant departments should strengthen ideological education and organizational leadership in saving copper. The state's material supply departments should strictly control the supply of copper. Workers and technicians should use their brains, put forward rationalization proposals, and expand the scope of using copper substitutes to minimize the consumption of copper.

### 节约用铜

    节约用铜
    李圣庭
    铜是工业生产中必需的重要物资。我国虽然有丰富的铜矿资源，但生产量还不多，特别是随着国家建设的迅速发展，铜的需要量日益增加，生产远远赶不上需要。因此，节约用铜，广泛推行铜的代用品，就具有很重要的意义。
    过去一个时期，各地在节约用铜的工作上已获得不少成绩。一九五四年北京试制成功了以铁代铜的新产品一百多种，这些新产品如果在北京全面推广，每年可节约四百七十多吨铜。沈阳试制成功了二十三种以铁代铜的水暖器材，半年内就节约了两千吨铜。天津试制成功了二十四种代用铜的消防器材，可节约铜九百三十多吨。上海初步开展了节约用铜的工作，就给国家节约了四、五千吨铜。这些新产品完全符合质量要求，坚固耐用，在设备要求较高的建筑物上也能适用。天津某些工厂曾作了鎷铁和黄铜的抗张力试验，结果证明一公分厚的鎷铁管的抗张力为三十公斤，而黄铜管的抗张力仅十三公斤，由此可见鎷铁管的质量高于铜管，但鎷铁铸件的成本却较黄铜铸件低三分之二。
    但是，至今也还有不少制造铜产品的工厂没有重视节约用铜的问题。他们认为“现在让做铜制品就做，等不让做了再说”。显然，这种态度是不对的。节约用铜，以铜的代用品来制造产品，是国家对铜制品工厂提出的方针，今天所以还没有一律不让做铜制品，只不过是留一个时间，让这些工厂在采用代用品上摸索出经验来。等待观望，只是一种对节约国家重要物资的不负责任的行为。
    有些工厂怕制了以铁代铜的新产品卖不出去，而不积极试制。这种顾虑是不必要的。随着节约运动的开展，以铁代铜的产品的销路将大大增加，将来卖不出去的，不是以铁代铜的产品，而可能是铜制品，至于现在有些单位不愿意购用以铁代铜的产品，应多加解释，从积极方面去说服他们。
    也还有一些使用单位，特别是其中的建筑单位在使用铜的代用品方面有抵触情绪。他们强调只有用铜制的装饰才算讲究，才更美观，因而建筑物的楼梯踏板、门拉手、包角、门推板、合页等都要采用铜制的，当地买不到，也不惜跑很远的路到外地采买。这是一种显然的浪费行为。因为使用铜的代用品，对建筑的适用、经济、乃至美观，完全不发生任何不好的影响，有什么理由拒绝采用呢？
    节约用铜是一个艰巨复杂的工作，制造铜制品的工厂很多，使用铜制品的单位也很多，涉及的范围很广。各个有关部门应该加强节约用铜的思想教育和组织领导，国家的物资供应部门应该严格控制铜的供应，工人们和技术人员们要开动脑筋，提合理化建议，扩大使用铜的代用品的范围，使铜的耗用量减至最小限度。
