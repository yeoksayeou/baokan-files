    Indian Ambassador to China, R.K. Nehru, as well as diplomatic envoys and embassy officials from various countries to China, also attended the reception.
    Head of Delegation, Mr. Chand, said in his speech at the reception: "In the past three weeks, China has attracted us with her beauty, courteous hospitality, and sincere friendship. In the years to come, every member of our delegation will regard this visit as a precious and unforgettable page in their life history. The only way I can express the indescribable joy of being among these good friends is to propose a toast to one person – His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai, who is not only a good and sincere friend of our country, but also embodies for us the lovely qualities of the Chinese people and the wisdom of their government." Mr. Chand proposed a toast to Premier Zhou Enlai, the great Chinese people, and the Chinese government!
    Premier Zhou Enlai then delivered a speech, saying: "We are very happy to have the opportunity to receive the Indian Cultural Delegation and to have the opportunity to appreciate the outstanding performances of the Indian artists. From the performances of the Indian artists, we have seen the enthusiasm and wisdom of the Indian people, and we have seen the common desire of the Chinese and Indian people to enhance cultural cooperation between the two countries on a new friendly basis. I hope that after this visit, through the friends of the Indian Cultural Delegation, the friendship of the 600 million Chinese people will be brought back to the nearly 400 million Indian people."
    Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by proposing a toast to the successful performances of the Indian Cultural Delegation in our country, to the health of Head of Delegation Chand and his wife and all the friends of the delegation, to the friendly cooperation and the increasing development of cultural exchanges between China and India, and to the health of Prime Minister Nehru, who is committed to promoting friendly cooperation between China and India and world peace!
    Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of Culture, and Head of Delegation Chand successively toasted at the meeting to the friendly cooperation and the development and consolidation of cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and India. Ding Xilin also shouted in Hindi "Long live Sino-Indian friendship, long live peace!" Cao Yu, a member of the National Committee of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, toasted the Indian artists on behalf of the literary and art circles.
    Indian friends prepared rich and delicious dishes and snacks to entertain Chinese friends. Among the dishes, two Indian sweets were the most attractive. One was Jalebi, and the other was Peda.
    The hosts frequently used newly learned Chinese phrases: "Hello," "Eat," "Cheers," and "Thank you" to converse with Chinese friends.
    During the banquet, the band played Chinese folk dance music such as "Picking Tea and Catching Butterflies."
    After the banquet, Indian artists also performed wonderful musical and dance programs.
    The lively and joyful reception, filled with friendship, lasted until late at night.

    周恩来总理接着致词说：“我们很高兴地有机会接待印度文化代表团，并有机会欣赏到印度艺术家们的杰出演出。从印度艺术家的表演中，我们看到了印度人民的热情和智慧，看到了中印两国人民在新的友好的基础上增进两国文化合作的共同愿望。我希望在这次访问之后，通过印度文化代表团的朋友们，把六万万中国人民的友谊带回给近四万万的印度人民。”

    印度朋友准备了丰富美味的菜肴和点心来招待中国友人。菜里有两个印度的甜食最吸引人。一个是吉里必，一个是裴达。
    主人们不时地用新学的中国话：“你好”“吃饭”“干杯”“谢谢”和中国朋友交谈。
    宴会上，乐队奏着中国的民间舞曲“采茶扑蝶”等歌曲。
    宴会结束后，印度的艺术家还表演了精采的音乐歌舞节目。
