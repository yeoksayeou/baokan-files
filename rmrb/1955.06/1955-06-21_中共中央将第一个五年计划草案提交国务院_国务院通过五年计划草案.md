    In order to unify the wage system for staff members of state organs, it is decided that a wage system shall be implemented for all staff members starting in July of this year. Unless otherwise formally ordered, the following points are hereby notified:
    1.  The various measures for changing to the wage system will only be issued by the end of June. Before receiving the formal order, provinces and cities can first change the personnel under the contract system to a wage system treatment according to the current wage standards starting from July. After the formal order is issued, the new wage plan will be used for final settlement.
    2.  After the full implementation of the wage system, measures for charging staff members for living in public housing, using public furniture, water, and electricity should be actively prepared in July, and rent and fees should be collected uniformly according to the new measures starting in August. July will remain the same, and those who have not collected will not collect for the time being.
    3.  After a small number of contract-based staff members with many children are converted to a wage system, if the actual income is reduced, the reduced part will not be retained. However, if the reduction causes actual difficulties in life, the welfare expenses of the organization can be used for appropriate subsidies.
    4.  For army transferred personnel before the end of December 1954, if those who still implement the contract system after this change to the wage system, if the wage income is lower than the contract system income, the difference can be temporarily retained.
