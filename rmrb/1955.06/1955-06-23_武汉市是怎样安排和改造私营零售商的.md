How Wuhan Arranges and Transforms Private Retailers
Shen Yihong, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Commerce

    Maintaining and adjusting the turnover of private retailers and effectively incorporating their business activities into the national plan is a very important task in arranging and transforming private retailers. Over the past year, state-owned commercial departments in Wuhan have done a lot of work in this regard. One of these is that each state-owned specialized company comprehensively investigated and calculated the amount of turnover required for private retailers related to it to maintain their operations. At the same time, based on the balance between social purchasing power and social commodity volume, and under the principle of ensuring that state-owned commerce can stabilize the market and facilitate residents' purchases, a social retail commodity circulation plan was formulated with a view to comprehensively considering and arranging state-owned, cooperative-owned, and private sectors. This plan determines the proportion of public and private retail sales in each industry. To date, the proportion of public and private retail sales has been determined for eleven industries, including grain, silk cloth, general merchandise, oils and fats, tobacco and alcohol, medicine, pork, beef, coal briquettes, cultural and educational supplies, and tea. Among these eleven industries, except for the beef industry, which lacks sufficient supply, all have surpluses. In April of this year, the annual monthly turnover was roughly determined for each household in each industry by using the method of private businesses submitting sales plans and state-owned commercial departments approving them.
    For those industries where state-owned and cooperative commerce do not have retail business, the turnover required to maintain their continued operation was also calculated household by household in each industry, so that arrangement measures could be taken.
    After the social retail commodity circulation plan and the proportion of public and private operations were determined, state-owned and cooperative commerce had to control the turnover of their retail business within the prescribed plan and proportion. If the proportion was too high, it would be appropriately reduced; if it was insufficient, it would be increased. Since February of this year, state-owned commerce in Wuhan has reduced eleven department store and fabric retail stores, and more than thirty grocery and non-staple food retail stores. The variety of products operated has also been appropriately reduced. Many private retailers have continued to maintain their operations due to increased turnover.
    Under the condition of controlling the retail sales of private businesses not exceeding the prescribed proportion, in order to help private retailers increase their turnover, the People's Bank relaxed loans for merchants with small capital, difficulty in purchasing goods, or incomplete commodity patterns, and state-owned commerce lowered the wholesale starting point and entrusted them to sell some commodities on consignment. This has played a certain role in maintaining a certain retail sales volume for private businesses and ensuring market supply. When some commodities of higher value or poor sales affect the market supply when private businesses cannot purchase goods, a part of them is entrusted to private businesses for consignment sales. At present, Wuhan has developed more than 150 such consignment households in nine industries including general merchandise, silk cloth, and hardware, with more than 2,000 consignment varieties. In February and March alone, private businesses can obtain 80,000 yuan in consignment handling fees.
    In order to change the habit of some consumers who are unwilling to buy things in private retail stores, in addition to the cooperative canceling the method of discounted sales to members, measures such as strengthening the management of retail prices of private commerce, promoting private businesses to correct their business style, and hanging signs of state-owned consignment stores and state-owned distribution stores in private retail stores were also adopted.
    Excessive costs are one of the main reasons why it is difficult for private businesses to maintain their operations. Since 1954, under the leadership of the state-owned economy and with the active support of store employees, private stores have generally paid attention to the work of reasonably reducing costs, and have achieved significant results. For example, 115 households in the silk cloth, general merchandise, hardware, and new medicine industries in Jianghan District reduced costs by 350,000 yuan in 1954.
    For some private retail stores with special difficulties, appropriate and effective measures are taken according to the specific situation to keep them going. Private commerce, which developed on the basis of speculation and competition, is often a cluster of many stores of the same nature, which is another important reason why some merchants find it difficult to maintain their operations. Therefore, when arranging private retailers, it is necessary to appropriately adjust the old commercial network. However, due to the many specific difficulties in adjusting the commercial network (such as housing problems, relocation costs, etc.), so far, it has only been selected and piloted in the department store industry. According to the situation of the eight department stores that have been merged and relocated, the situation of past losses has been reversed after the adjustment. For example, after the merger of the private Weixin Department Store and Sanyou Department Store, costs were reduced by about 20%. This not only allows them to maintain their operations, but also made a surplus of more than 3,000 yuan from January to April of this year.
    While arranging private businesses, in accordance with the principle of combining arrangement and transformation, we have also carried out the transformation of enterprises and the ideological transformation of people through various forms of state capitalism. In terms of enterprise transformation, more than 2,000 private businesses in the city have been reporting their sales plans to state-owned companies on a monthly basis, and are gradually overcoming the blindness of their operations. For example, in the past, the silk cloth industry would purchase a large amount of goods whenever they saw a slight increase in sales, resulting in the backlog of certain commodities; now these phenomena have basically been eliminated. In distribution stores and consignment stores with labor-capital relations, democratic management committees or management groups with the participation of store employees have been established. The democratic management committee or management group is only a supervisory body, and the capitalist manager is still specifically responsible for the daily work. Through the establishment of the democratic management system, the enthusiasm of store employees has been greatly improved, thereby guaranteeing and supervising the transformation of the enterprise. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish a financial management system, tighten expenditures, and determine the profit distribution ratio to improve the profit distribution relationship. In addition, various enterprise management systems have been established, such as store affairs systems, meeting systems, and leave systems, to change their old backward state.
    In terms of the ideological transformation of people, in addition to receiving a certain degree of education as enterprises are transformed, capitalists have also established a regular learning system in industries such as silk cloth, general merchandise, and oils and fats, in order to educate capitalists to love the country, abide by the law, actively operate, accept socialist transformation, and improve their understanding of socialism.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the above arrangement and transformation work, state-owned commerce has also strengthened and improved its wholesale business to strengthen the leading force of the socialist economy in the market. To date, seventeen wholesale institutions have been added to the city, simplifying wholesale procedures and facilitating customer purchases. At the same time, the "zoning of wholesale departments, division of business by industry, section, and household" system has been implemented, that is, private businesses are assigned to each district wholesale department for arrangement and transformation according to the region; the wholesale department then divides the private businesses in the district to the business personnel by section and household for specific responsibility. Each business person is responsible for several to dozens of private businesses according to the specific conditions of each industry. His task is to understand the operating conditions of private businesses on a regular basis, and through the supply of goods and the adjustment of varieties, to enable private businesses to maintain a certain turnover, and to report the situation to the leaders and market management departments in a timely manner. With someone in charge of each private business, the problems that occur in the arrangement and transformation can be solved in a timely and specific manner.
    In order to ensure the smooth implementation of various measures, the state-owned commercial leadership organs have also conducted policy and ideological education among all staff. By reviewing past work, conducting criticism, and studying the government's policies and guidelines for transforming private commerce, all staff have become more aware of the current status and responsibilities of state-owned commerce, and conscientiously implement the policies and guidelines for arranging the market and transforming private businesses.

    武汉市是怎样安排和改造私营零售商的
    武汉市商业局副局长　沈以宏
    维持和调整私营零售商的营业额，并有效地把它们的业务活动纳入国家计划的轨道，是对私营零售商实行安排和改造的一项很重要的工作。一年多来，武汉市国营商业部门，在这方面做了很多工作。其中之一是：各国营专业公司全面调查和计算同自己有关的私营零售商，需要多少营业额才能维持下来。同时，又根据社会购买力和社会商品量平衡，在保证国营商业能以稳定市场，方便居民购买的原则下，本着对国营、合作社营、私营统筹兼顾、全面安排的方针，制定了社会零售商品流转计划，确定各行业的公私零售比重。到目前为止，已经确定公私零售比重的，有粮食、绸布、百货、油脂、烟酒、医药、猪肉、牛肉、煤球、文教用品、茶叶等十一个行业。在这十一个行业的经营中，除货源不足的牛肉业外，都有盈余。今年四月份，又用由私商申报进销计划、国营商业部门审批的方法，以行业为单位，逐户大体确定了全年分月的营业额。
    对那些国营和合作社商业没有零售业务的行业，也以行业为单位，逐户计算了维持其继续经营所需的营业额，以便采取安排的措施。
    在社会零售商品流转计划和公私经营比重确定以后，国营和合作社商业就要把自己的零售业务的营业额，控制在规定的计划和比重以内。比重过多就适当减少，不足的就增加。从今年二月起，武汉市国营商业共减少了十一个百货布匹零售店，三十多个杂货副食品零售店。经营的品种也适当减少了。许多私营零售商因营业额增加而继续维持下来了。
    在控制私商零售额不超过规定的比重的条件下，为了帮助私营零售商提高营业额，对于资本小、进货有困难、或者商品花色不全的商户，由人民银行放宽贷款，国营商业调低批发起点，并委托代销部分商品。这样对维持私商的一定零售额，对保证市场的供应都起了一定的作用。有些价值较高或销路不畅的商品，在私商不能进货，而又影响市场供应的时候，把其中一部分委托私商代销。到目前，武汉市在百货、绸布、五金等九个行业中共发展了这种代销户一百五十多户，代销品种达二千多种，仅二、三月份私商即可获得代销手续费八万元。
    为了改变部分消费者不愿到私营零售商店买东西的习惯，除了合作社取消对社员减价销售的办法外，还采取了加强对私营商业零售价格的管理，推动私商端正经营作风，和在私营零售店悬挂国营代销店、国营经销店的牌子等办法。
    费用过高是使私商难于维持的主要原因之一。自一九五四年以来，在国营经济的领导下，在店员工人的积极支持下，私营商店中普遍注意合理降低费用的工作，收到了显著效果。如江汉区的绸布、百货、五金、新药等业的一百一十五户，一九五四年就降低了费用三十五万元。
    对于某些有特殊困难的私营零售商店，则根据具体情况采取适当的有效办法，使它们维持下来。在投机、竞争的基础上发展起来的私营商业，往往是许多同类性质的商店挤在一起，这是有些商户难于维持的又一重要原因。因此，在安排私营零售商时，就有必要适当地调整旧商业网。但由于调整商业网的具体困难较多（如房屋问题、搬迁费问题等），到现在为止，只在百货业中选择重点试行。根据合并，搬迁的八家百货店情况来看，调整以后都扭转了过去亏蚀的局面。如私营维新百货店和三友百货店合并后，约减少费用百分之二十。这样就不仅可以维持下来，而且从今年一到四月还盈余三千多元。
    在安排私商的同时，根据安排和改造相结合的方针，我们还通过各种国家资本主义形式进行了对企业的改造工作和对人的思想改造工作。在企业改造方面，全市已有二千多户私商逐月向国营公司申报进销计划，并在逐步克服经营的盲目性。如绸布业过去看到什么货物稍一畅销，就大量进货，以致造成某些商品的积压；现在这些现象已基本上消除了。在有劳资关系的经销店和代销店中，大都建立了有店员参加的民主管理委员会或管理小组。民主管理委员会或管理小组只是监督机构，具体负责日常工作的仍是资方经理。通过民主管理制度的建立，大大提高了店员工人的积极性，从而保证并监督了企业的改造。再就是要建立财务管理制度，紧缩开支，并确定利润分配比例，以改善利润分配关系。此外，还建立各种企业管理制度，如店务制度、会议制度、请假制度等，以改变其旧有的落后状态。
    在人的思想改造方面，资本家除随着企业的改造而受到一定的教育外，在绸布、百货、油脂等业里，还建立了资本家的定期学习制度，以便教育资本家爱国守法，积极经营，接受社会主义改造，提高对社会主义的认识。
    为了保证以上安排和改造工作的顺利进行，国营商业也加强和改进了批发业务，以加强社会主义经济对市场的领导力量。到目前为止，全市已增设了十七个批发机构，简化了批发手续，便利顾客进货。同时，实行了“批发部分区、营业员分业、分段、分户负责制”，即把私商按地区交各区批发部负责安排改造；批发部又将区内私商按段按户分给营业员具体负责。每一营业员根据各行业具体情况，负责数户到数十户私商。他的任务是经常了解私商经营情况，通过货源的供应和品种的调节，使私商能维持一定的营业额，并及时向领导上及市场管理部门反映情况。每户私商都有人专管，就可以及时地具体地解决在安排和改造中所发生的问题。
    为了保证各项措施的顺利贯彻，国营商业领导机关又在全体工作人员中进行政策思想教育工作。通过检查过去工作，开展批评、学习政府对私营商业进行改造的政策和方针，从而使全体工作人员都更加认清了当前国营商业的地位和职责，切实贯彻执行安排市场、改造私商的政策和方针。
