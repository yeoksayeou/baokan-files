    National People's Congress Deputies Inspecting Work in Hunan
    Report on Inspection Situation and Opinions to the Provincial People's Committee
    The Hunan Provincial People's Committee held its sixth meeting to listen to reports from National People's Congress deputies on the situation and opinions from their inspection work. Deputy Liu Fei said: From this inspection, I further understood that the central government's policies are correct. Those who clamor that there is not enough food, apart from a few individuals, mostly do not lack grain. He believes there are currently four issues in rural areas regarding grain that deserve attention. First, landlords, rich peasants, and hidden counter-revolutionaries are using the grain issue to spread rumors and sabotage, disturbing people's minds; second, some individual farmers have no plan for eating grain; third, some individual farmers use staple grain to raise pigs; fourth, due to some shortcomings in the work, there is a phenomenon of a few people lacking grain, for example, some party members, league members, and activists, in order to play a leading role, sold more grain than they should, disregarding the actual situation. Deputy He Guiyan said: In Beijing, I heard some people say that there were deviations in the unified purchase and sale of grain. What I have seen in Hunan is completely different. He used what he saw with his own eyes to prove that the policies of the Party and the government are correct, and the implementation of policies at the lower levels is basically correct as well. Deputy Tan Tiwu said that she was very happy to see the improvement of the farmers' awareness in Xiangtan, Wangcheng, Changsha and other places. Deputy Wu Yunfu inspected the disaster areas in Hanshou, Changde and other places, and saw the moving scene of rural workers diligently and enthusiastically leading the masses to do a good job in production. He said: The disaster victims are very grateful to the Communist Party and the government, which shows that the policies of the Party and the government are consistent with the demands of the masses. Deputy Shuai Mengqi believes that the achievements of the Dongting Lake levee restoration project are very great, and it has played a great role in helping disaster victims to restore production and rebuild their homes. Deputy Zeng San reflected the masses' demands and opinions on soil and water conservation and water conservancy construction in Yiyang. The deputies all put forward many opinions on the issues they saw.
    After the deputies reported, Governor Cheng Qian expressed his sincere acceptance of the valuable opinions put forward by the deputies and will work hard to improve some shortcomings in the work. (Our correspondent in Changsha)

    到湖南视察工作的全国人民代表大会代表
    向省人民委员会汇报视察的情况和意见
    湖南省人民委员会举行第六次会议，听取全国人民代表大会代表汇报视察工作的情况和意见。刘斐代表说：从这次视察中进一步领会到中央的各项政策是正确的，叫喊粮食不够吃的人，除了个别的而外，绝大部分并不缺粮。他认为目前在农村粮食方面有四个问题值得注意。第一是地主富农和潜伏的反革命分子假借粮食问题造谣破坏，扰乱人心；第二是个别农民吃粮没计划；第三是个别农民用主粮养猪；第四因为工作中的某些缺点而发生少数人缺粮的现象，例如有些党员、团员和积极分子为了发挥带头作用，不顾实际情况多卖了粮食。贺贵严代表说：我在北京听到某些人说粮食统购统销工作中有偏差，我来湖南以后所看到的事实完全两样。他以亲眼看到的情况证明党和政府的政策是正确的，下面执行政策基本上也是正确的。谭惕吾代表说，她看到湘潭、望城、长沙等地农民觉悟的提高，感到很高兴。伍云甫代表视察了汉寿、常德等地灾区的情况，看到农村工作人员勤勤恳恳满腔热情地领导群众搞好生产的动人情景。他说：灾民都非常感激共产党和政府，这说明党和政府的政策同群众的要求是一致的。帅孟奇代表认为洞庭湖堤垸修复工程的成绩很大，对于灾民恢复生产重建家园起了很大作用。曾三代表反映了群众对于益阳的水土保持、水利建设等方面的要求和意见。代表们都就各人所看到的问题提出了不少意见。
    代表们汇报后，省长程潜表示诚恳接受代表们所提出的宝贵意见，并努力改进某些工作中的缺点。  （本报驻长沙记者）
