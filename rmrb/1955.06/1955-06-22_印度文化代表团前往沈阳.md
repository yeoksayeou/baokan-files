Xinhua News Agency, Lushun, June 21st. The Indian Cultural Delegation, headed by Chand, left Lushun by special train for Shenyang at 9 p.m. on the 21st. Song Li, the Mayor of Lushun, Li Dongchao, the Deputy Mayor, Fang Bing, the Director of the Bureau of Culture, heads of cultural and artistic groups, and over 500 representatives from all walks of life went to the station to see them off. Many of those seeing them off were people who had seen the Indian artists perform yesterday, and they all came to bid farewell to the guests with reluctance. When the delegation members stepped onto the platform, the people seeing them off applauded and crowded around the guests, many stuffing bouquets into the delegation members' arms. Two Young Pioneers presented flowers to Chand and his wife.

Before boarding the train, Chand and his wife shook hands with the well-wishers to say goodbye. He said to the Mayor of Lushun: We received excellent hospitality in Lushun, and we will always remember it. He said to a child who presented him with flowers: I hope you become a good child of the people.

Before the delegation members boarded the train, Fang Bing, the Director of the Lushun Municipal Bureau of Culture, presented the distinguished guests with glassware, a special product of Lushun, on behalf of the people of Lushun.
