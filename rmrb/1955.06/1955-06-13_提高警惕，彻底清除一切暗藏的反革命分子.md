    Heighten Vigilance, Thoroughly Eliminate All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    Zhang Yun
    Wearing the banner of revolution, draped in the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, masquerading as revolutionary literati, infiltrating the revolutionary ranks, adopting two-faced tactics, taking advantage of people's ideological vulnerabilities, and with a program and organization, resolutely opposing the Party and the people—the hidden counter-revolutionary elements, the loyal running dogs of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang—the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, could not escape the eyes and ears of the Party and the people, and their masks have finally been torn off, revealing their full vicious and sinister true colors. The people of the whole country, seeing their ugly faces and mountain of evidence of crimes, are launching a punitive expedition and demanding in unison to thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. This is very natural. It also shows that the people of the whole country have clear distinctions between love and hate, and between the enemy and ourselves.
    The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is another victory in the continued struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. All hidden counter-revolutionary elements should see that no matter how clever or sophisticated their methods of concealment, the eyes of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people cannot be deceived. One day they will fall into the net of the people's law. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a good proof of this.
    However, we must not be complacent. We should still learn lessons from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident. The Hu Feng incident severely taught us:
    Low vigilance, insensitive sense of smell, a sense of complacency, and insufficient sense of political responsibility for the revolution are the most suitable climate for the hidden development of counter-revolutionary elements. Heightening vigilance and strengthening our sense of smell are the decisive conditions for ensuring that we thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the revolutionary ranks. We must firmly grasp this weapon and strike the enemy at any time.
    Without a true command of Marxist-Leninist theory, there can be no true ability to distinguish right from wrong, and it will be insufficient to see through the tricks of counter-revolutionary elements. Counter-revolutionary elements will then have the opportunity to sell fake goods in front of us. Adorning counter-revolutionary theories and counter-revolutionary ideas to deceive and confuse people and spread poison is the specialty of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements. Haven’t many people been poisoned by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in this way? Can we not study? Can we allow our theoretical level to remain low for a long time? Let us study diligently!
    The sentiments of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, not seeking the essence of truth, loving to listen to sensational words, and loving to read so-called profound articles, create propaganda opportunities for counter-revolutionary elements and provide a market for counter-revolutionary elements to sell fake goods. Counter-revolutionary elements are best at catering to people's preferences. Haven't many young intellectuals been poisoned by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements' speculative and opportunistic manipulation of the pen? Can we continue to cling to petty-bourgeois sentiments? Hurry up and throw it away!
    When a person's ideology is impure and there are shortcomings such as individualism, liberalism, pride and complacency, and dissatisfaction with leadership, the enemy is given an opportunity to aim. Facts have proved that the enemy is looking for targets among such people and is best at taking advantage of people's ideological vulnerabilities to drag people down. Haven't some people been dragged down by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in this way? Can we not learn a lesson from this? Can we not strengthen self-reform and improve our ideological awareness? Strengthen self-education, self-reform, and seriously examine our own thinking, so that no counter-revolutionary elements have any opportunity to take advantage of our thinking!
    Our women across the country, like the people across the country, have the sacred responsibility to defend the motherland, defend the fruits of the revolution, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland. To this end, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we must act with the people of the whole country and resolutely fight to the end to thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all counter-revolutionary elements! We must build two strong lines of defense in society and in our own minds, so that no counter-revolutionary elements' thoughts and actions can find any hiding place.

    提高警惕，彻底清除一切暗藏的反革命分子
    章蕴
    打着革命旗帜，披着马克思列宁主义外衣，伪装革命文人，混入革命队伍，采取两面手法，乘人思想之危，有纲领、有组织地坚决反党、反人民的暗藏的反革命分子——帝国主义和蒋匪帮的忠实走狗——胡风反革命集团，终于逃不出党和人民的耳目，已经被撕破了假面具，露出了全副凶恶阴狠的原形。全国人民看见他们这副丑恶相和如山的罪证，大兴问罪之师，异口同声地要求彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，这是很自然的。这也说明了全国人民是憎爱分明、敌我分清的。
    胡风反革命集团的被揭露，这是中国人民同帝国主义和蒋介石残余匪帮继续斗争的又一胜利，一切暗藏的反革命分子应该看到，不管反革命分子隐身法如何高明、巧妙，中国共产党和中国人民的眼睛是蒙蔽不了的，总是有一天要落入人民的法网的，胡风反革命集团的被揭露就是一个很好的证明。
    但是，我们不能自满，仍应在胡风反革命集团事件中吸取教训，胡风事件严重地教训了我们：
    警惕不高、嗅觉不灵、太平观念、对革命的政治责任感不足，这是反革命分子得以暗藏发展的最适宜的气候，提高警惕、加强嗅觉，这是保证我们彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团及一切暗藏在革命队伍中的反革命分子的决定条件，我们要紧握着这个武器，随时打击敌人。
    没有真正的马克思列宁主义理论的修养，就不可能有真正辨别是非的能力，就不足识破反革命分子的伎俩，反革命分子就有可能在我们面前卖假货。把反革命理论和反革命思想，加以粉饰，来欺骗蒙混人，散布毒素，这是胡风反革命分子的拿手好戏，许多人不就是这样中了胡风反革命集团分子的毒吗？我们能够不学习吗？能够任自己的理论水平长期不高吗？我们认真学习吧！
    小资产阶级知识分子的情调，不求真理实质，爱听哗众取宠的言词，爱读所谓深奥的文章，这就替反革命分子制造了宣传机会，就给反革命分子以卖假货的市场；反革命分子最会投人所好，许多青年知识分子不就在胡风反革命分子的投机取巧、玩弄笔头的手腕下受了毒吗？我们能够再拖着小资产阶级的情绪不放吗？赶忙抛掉它吧！
    一个人思想意识不纯，存在着个人主义、自由主义、骄傲自满情绪、对领导不满情绪等等毛病的时候，就给敌人留下了瞄准的机会。事实证明，敌人就是在这种人中间找寻对象，并最善于乘人思想之危拖人下水的，有的人不就是这样被胡风反革命集团拖下水了吗？能不引为教训吗？能不加强自我改造，提高思想觉悟吗？加强自我教育，自我改造，认真检查自己的思想，不让任何反革命分子在我们的思想上有机可乘吧！
    我们全国妇女和全国人民一样有着神圣的保卫祖国、保卫革命的胜利果实、保卫祖国的社会主义建设的责任。为此，我们要在中国共产党的英明领导下同全国人民一起，积极行动起来，为彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团及一切反革命分子坚决斗争到底！我们要在社会上和自己思想上筑起两道坚强的防线，不让任何反革命分子的思想和行为找到任何藏身之地。
