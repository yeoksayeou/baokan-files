    Earnestly Conduct Classification in the Rectification of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
    Xiang Dong, Wang Lin

    In order to effectively rectify and consolidate agricultural producers' cooperatives, all localities should ascertain the true situation of agricultural producers' cooperatives in their counties, districts, and townships, and realistically conduct a serious classification. Only by classifying well can we rationally organize and use forces, accurately implement policies, and adapt to each cooperative's specific conditions, consolidating those that should be consolidated and shrinking those that should be shrunk. Inappropriate classification will result in the failure to consolidate those that should be consolidated and the failure to shrink those that should be shrunk; it will also lead to prolonged entanglement in rectification work, affecting the leadership over the majority of cooperatives and preventing the timely resolution of problems in the majority of cooperatives, leading to a shift from relatively consolidated to unconsolidated or even collapse.

    From the recent county party secretary meeting convened by the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province and from individual counties in the Tangshan area, the following erroneous thoughts and practices are the main obstacles to realistic classification:

    First, there is complacency and blind optimism regarding the problems in cooperatives developed after last autumn and the tense rural situation caused by these problems. Some county, district, and township staff members, to varying degrees, tend to overemphasize achievements and underestimate or ignore shortcomings; they are satisfied with the percentage of collectivization and do not face up to the many serious problems that urgently need to be resolved within the cooperatives. Therefore, when problems within the cooperatives are discovered, they are always considered a reflection of the backward thinking of the peasants, and rarely are checks made to see whether policies have been fully implemented or whether there are deviations from the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. Therefore, in classifying cooperatives, they do not proceed from the actual situation, and always have more Class One and Class Two cooperatives, and few or almost no Class Three cooperatives, and no Class Four cooperatives at all, or hardly any. (Class One cooperatives are the best, Class Two are average, Class Three have more problems, and Class Four are "cooperatives in name only.")

    Second, the achievements of the previous stage of rectification work are overestimated. Many county and district staff members believe that the agricultural producers' cooperatives in their localities have been universally rectified once, and some even two or three times, and that there are no major problems or no problems at all. They do not understand that although some cooperatives have improved after rectification, the rectification of a large number of cooperatives has the following two shortcomings: 1. The principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit is generally not sufficiently implemented. For example, the focus of rectification in Luan County from after the Spring Festival to the end of March was only on "focusing on establishing labor organizations, getting production started, formulating production plans, settling accounts for old cooperatives, and establishing accounts for new cooperatives." Therefore, although some cooperatives have been rectified, the fundamental problems have not been resolved. Miao Ruichun, secretary of the Luan County No. 1 District Party Committee, said when referring to the effect of the district's rectification of agricultural cooperatives: "We originally had thirty-six Class Three and Class Four cooperatives in our district. After rectification, the number of these two types of cooperatives is still the same!" 2. The rectification methods are relatively crude. In some cases, the problems to be solved and the solutions were only studied among key members, without fully mobilizing the cooperative members to discuss them. In some cases, even consultation among key members was insufficient; only the principles put forward by the higher authorities were discussed before a decision was made. Zhou Tingxun, secretary of the Luan County No. 8 District Party Committee, said when talking about the district's rectification methods: "Some district and township staff members would ask key members what problems there were, and then talk about the problems they raised. Sometimes they would hold a general meeting of cooperative members to talk about them. After talking, they would ask for opinions, and the key members would say, 'You spoke well, there won't be any problems this time!' And that cooperative would be considered rectified." If a rectified cooperative was originally Class Three, it would mostly be considered Class Two, and if it was originally Class Two, it would be considered Class One. Zhou Tingxun spoke very realistically about the effect of adopting this rectification method: "The category has risen, but the problems have not decreased."

    Third, the work is not thorough, and cooperatives are classified according to their superficial situation, or even based on subjective estimates. For example, in Fengrun No. 11 District, the sixty-five cooperatives in seven townships, including Hancheng Town and Donghuantuo, Wanggezhuang, and Yangyikoutou, were once classified as follows due to the lack of in-depth work: twenty-six Class One cooperatives, thirty-eight Class Two cooperatives, and only one Class Three cooperative. After an actual investigation by the county party committee's rectification work team, there were only eleven Class One cooperatives, thirty-two Class Two cooperatives, and twenty-two Class Three cooperatives; the Donghuantuo cooperative, which was originally classified as Class One, was actually controlled by rich peasant elements, who were openly sabotaging the agricultural cooperative (and have recently been dealt with according to law). Some also adopt the method of "touching a point to calculate the area" (relying on key investigations to extrapolate to the entire county and district) to classify. Those who adopt this method are people who do not delve into their work on a regular basis, are unclear about the underlying situation, and are unwilling to conduct arduous investigations and research. In-depth investigation of key points is very necessary; however, relying on the results of key investigations to extrapolate to the overall situation is obviously divorced from reality.

    Fourth, the correct standards for classification are not strictly adhered to. In the previous period, some areas only determined the categories based on the degree to which conditions such as mutual aid foundation, organizational purity, cadre fairness and competence, reasonable regulations, sound organization, unity between poor and middle peasants, proper labor organization, specific production plans, and sufficient production funds and means of production were met, and did not emphasize the important standard of how well the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit was implemented. The result of the classification in Fengrun County No. 16 District in the previous period was: out of the two hundred cooperatives in the district, there were one hundred and five Class One cooperatives, and only five Class Three cooperatives. Recently, according to the classification standards stipulated by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, the initial assessment showed that there were only forty-six Class One cooperatives, and the number of Class Three cooperatives had increased from three to thirteen, and there were also eight Class Four cooperatives. At present, some staff members still do not fully recognize the important significance of reclassifying according to the classification standards stipulated by the provincial party committee, and there are still incomplete phenomena in grasping the classification standards.

    In order to ensure that agricultural cooperatives are classified realistically, it is first necessary to overcome complacency. Of course, this should not be used to negate the great achievements made in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the achievements of the rectification work in the past period. In fact, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Tangshan area was launched after considerable organizational and ideological preparation, and the vast majority of cooperatives still meet the conditions for running a cooperative. Since the beginning of spring, agricultural cooperative production has developed greatly after rectification; after the implementation of the "Three Fixes" policy for grain, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has been further improved. These achievements must be affirmed; ignoring these achievements does not conform to the facts, and these achievements are the foundation for doing a good job in rectification and consolidation. However, achievements must never be turned into ideological burdens that hinder in-depth work and policy implementation. If we are satisfied with achievements and do not delve into the serious problems existing in the cooperatives, it will inevitably lead to losses in our work and affect the smooth development of the collectivization movement. Of course, while overcoming complacency, we must not only look at problems and negate achievements, and regard many cooperatives as unqualified and unable to continue operating; for those cooperatives that have problems and difficulties but can continue to operate after rectification and consolidation, they should not all be listed as targets for contraction and easily dissolved during rectification.

    Secondly, in order to classify agricultural cooperatives realistically, we must further delve into the work, conduct in-depth understanding among the cooperative members, discover the problems existing in the cooperatives, and comprehensively study each cooperative to see which category it should belong to. We must also revise the already classified categories based on in-depth work and understanding of the situation, so that the categories of cooperatives are more in line with reality. Distinguishing between Class Three (cooperatives that need vigorous rectification) and Class Four (cooperatives that should be suspended or reorganized) is particularly important; however, distinguishing between these two types of cooperatives is not easy. Only by delving into the work, grasping and studying the situation, can we correctly distinguish them, so that the leadership's decision to rectify or contract a cooperative meets the policy requirements. In in-depth work, we must have a clear policy ideology. In addition to paying attention to the education and inspection of staff work style, the leadership should especially strengthen the policy leadership of staff members.

    Third, when conducting in-depth understanding of the situation and classifying, we should conscientiously and comprehensively grasp the standards stipulated by the provincial party committee, prevent carelessness, and also prevent arbitrarily changing the categories of cooperatives, deviating from the standards stipulated by the provincial party committee, in order to protect personal "face" and "prestige" or out of fear of trouble; we must also prevent the phenomenon of not comprehensively measuring according to the standards of each category, so as to ensure that the classification can be done realistically.

    在整顿农业生产合作社中应认真进行分类
    向东　王林
    为了切实地整顿巩固农业生产合作社，各地应当摸清本县、本区、本乡农业生产合作社的真实情况，实事求是地认真地进行分类。把类分好，才能合理地组织和使用力量，准确地贯彻政策，因社制宜，把那些应当巩固的巩固起来，对那些应当收缩的加以收缩。分类不恰当，就会发生该巩固的没有去巩固，该收缩的没有去收缩的现象；也会长期纠缠在整顿工作方面，影响到对多数社的领导，使多数社的问题不能及时解决，由比较巩固到不巩固，甚至垮台。
    从中共河北省唐山地委最近召开的县委书记会议上和从唐山地区个别县了解，以下的错误思想和做法，是实事求是地分类的主要障碍：
    第一种，对去年秋后发展社中的毛病和由这些毛病引起的农村紧张情况，表现麻痹自满，盲目乐观。有些县、区、乡的工作人员，程度不同地偏重多看成绩、少看或不看缺点；满足于合作化的百分数，不正视现在社内存在的急待解决的许多严重问题。因此，对于已发现的社内的问题，总认为是农民落后思想的反映，而很少从政策贯彻得是否充分、有无违反自愿互利政策的偏向等方面去加以检查。因此，在分类时，也就不从实际情况出发，总是一类、二类多，三类少，没有或几乎没有四类，甚至三类也没有。（一类是最好的社，二类是一般的社，三类是问题较多的社，四类是有名无实的
  “挂名社”。）
    第二种，过高地估计前一段整顿工作的成绩。不少县、区的工作人员，认为当地的农业生产合作社已经普遍整顿了一遍，有的甚至整顿了两三遍，问题已经不大或再也没啥问题了。他们不了解，虽然有的社经过整顿，提高了一步；但是，对为数很多的社的整顿，却有以下两个缺点：一、自愿互利政策的贯彻一般是不够的，如滦县的整社重点，在春节后到三月底只是“着重抓住了建立劳动组织，搞起生产，订生产计划，老社结账和新社建账等工作”。因此，有些社虽然经过了整顿，但根本问题还没有解决。滦县一区区委书记苗瑞春同志在提到这个区整顿农业合作社的效果时说：“我们区原有三十六个三类四类社，整顿到了现在，这两类社的数目还是那么多！”二、整顿的方法比较粗糙，有的是只在骨干分子中研究了一下要解决的问题和解决问题的办法，没有充分地发动社员群众讨论，有的就连在骨干分子中商量也很不够，只讲一下上级提出的原则，就作了决定。滦县八区区委书记周廷勋在谈到这个区的整社方法时说：“有的区、乡工作人员，找骨干分子问问有啥问题，然后就他们提出的问题讲一讲，有时候召开个社员大会讲一讲，讲完后，征求一下意见，骨干分子说‘讲得可以，这回可没问题啦！’这个社就算整顿过了。”整顿过的社，如果原来是三类，多半就认为成了二类，原是二类的就认为成了一类。周廷勋对采用这种整顿方法的效果，说得很切实：“类别上升了，问题并没有减少。”
    第三种，工作不深入，按照社的表面情况分类，甚至凭主观估计来分类。例如丰润十一区对韩城镇和东欢坨、王各庄、杨义口头等七个乡的六十五个社，就曾因为工作不深入，排成：一类社二十六个，二类社三十八个，三类社只有一个。经县委整社工作队实际调查，一类社只有十一个，二类社是三十二个，三类社是二十二个；原排在一类社中的东欢坨社，竟是富农分子操纵的，富农分子对农业合作社明目张胆地进行破坏（最近已法办）。也有的是采取“摸点算面”（依据重点调查，推算全县全区）的办法来分类。采用这种方法的，都是平时不深入工作，底码不清，又不愿艰苦地进行调查研究的人。深入重点进行调查，这是非常必要的；但是，依靠重点的调查结果，推算全面，显然是脱离实际的。
    第四种，不能严格地掌握分类的正确标准。有些地区在前一时期，只是根据互助基础、组织纯洁、骨干公道能干、章程合理、组织健全、贫农中农团结、劳动组织妥善、生产计划具体、生产资金和生产资料充足等条件的具备程度来确定类别的，对于自愿互利政策贯彻得怎样这个重要标准则没有强调。丰润县十六区前一时期分类的结果是：全区二百个社中，有一百零五个一类社，三类社只有五个。最近，根据中共河北省委规定的分类标准初步衡量，一类社只有四十六个，三类社由三个增到了十三个，还有了八个四类社。现在，有些工作人员，对于根据省委所规定的分类标准去重新进行分类的重要意义仍然认识不足，在掌握分类标准方面，也还有不全面的现象。
    为了保证实事求是地对农业合作社进行分类，当前首先要克服麻痹自满情绪。当然，也不能因此而否定互助合作运动所取得的伟大成绩以及过去一个时期整社工作的成就。事实上，唐山地区的互助合作运动，是经过相当的组织准备和思想准备后开展的，绝大部分社还是合乎办社条件的。入春以来，经过整顿，农业合作社生产已有很大开展；贯彻了粮食“三定”政策后，群众生产积极性进一步提高。这些成绩是必须肯定的；忽略这些成绩，就不符合事实，这些成绩是做好整顿巩固工作的基础。但是，决不可把成绩变成妨碍深入工作和贯彻政策的思想包袱。如果满足于成绩而不去深入研究社中存在的严重问题，必将招致工作上的损失，使合作化运动的顺利发展受到影响。当然，在克服麻痹思想的同时，也不可只看毛病、否定成绩，把许多社都看成是不具备条件和不能办下去的；对那些有问题有困难但经过整顿巩固还能办下去的社，不应一律列为收缩对象，在整顿中轻易加以解散。
    其次，为了实事求是地对农业合作社进行分类，必须进一步深入工作，到社员群众中进行深入的了解，发现社里存在的问题，全面地研究各个社，看看它们究竟应当属于哪类，并要在深入工作了解情况的基础上，修正已经分出的类别，使社的类别更加切合实际。区别第三类（需要大力整顿的社）第四类（应当停办或改组的社）是特别重要的；可是，区别这两类社并不是很容易的。只有深入工作，掌握和研究情况，才有可能正确区分，使领导方面在决定对一个社整顿或收缩时符合政策要求。在深入工作中，要有明确的政策思想。领导方面除了要注意对工作人员进行工作作风的教育和检查以外，更应该特别加强对工作人员的政策领导。
    第三，在深入了解情况进行分类时，应当认真地全面地掌握省委规定的标准，防止粗枝大叶，也不可为了顾个人的“面子”“威信”或怕麻烦，对应收缩的不加收缩，离开省委规定的标准，任意更动社的类别；也要防止不根据各类的标准全面进行衡量的现象，以保证分类能够做到实事求是。
