Under the influence of the decadent American way of life and war propaganda, the moral corruption of American children has reached an alarming level. The rapid annual increase in juvenile delinquency cases and the increasingly serious nature of the crimes in the United States illustrate this point.

According to a report by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee, the number of juvenile offenders in the United States increased from 300,000 in 1948 to 385,000 in 1952, and then to 435,000 in 1953. In 1954, the number of children with criminal behavior reached one million.

American juvenile delinquency does not only occur in a few large cities, but is prevalent throughout the country. Young people have formed gangs of various names and armed themselves. For example, according to American press reports, in New Orleans in the southern United States, there are juvenile gang organizations with various names such as the "Nazi Stormtroopers Club," the "Gold Lock Gang," and the "River Rat Gang." The weapons they use range from clubs and knives to guns and even hand grenades. The juvenile "crime wave" has developed to such an extent that curfews have been imposed in some cities or children are prohibited from going out on the streets at night.

Judging from the nature of American juvenile delinquency, its brutality and barbarism have reached an unbelievable level. Here are a few examples: A sixty-two-year-old surviving victim said that the teenagers first beat him, then tied burning cotton to his feet, poured gasoline on him, set him on fire, and ran away. In Detroit, a thirteen-year-old boy named Robert shot and killed his own mother because he had an argument with her while adjusting the wavelengths on the television. At his mother's funeral, he even told others that his mother's death meant "a good income" for him, because he could inherit his mother's estate to squander. During the court trial, Robert handed over twelve percussion pistols, two BB guns, and one .30 caliber rifle. In New York, a young man poisoned his own parents. When he discovered that his father was not yet dead, he forcibly poured poison into his father's mouth.

Therefore, even the American "New York Times," when talking about juvenile offenders, had to say: "It is hard to imagine that children can become thieves, bandits, drug addicts, and executioners, but it is a living reality." Not only that, but many American teenagers under the education of the American way of life simply regard crime as a normal part of life. According to Senator Hendrickson, chairman of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, last year a survey of college and middle school students in New Jersey on their views on criminal behavior revealed that among the hundreds of students surveyed, as many as 75 percent believed that lying and cheating were inconsequential, more than 12 percent believed that theft was excusable, 15 percent believed that wanton destruction of property was not a crime, and another 17 percent believed that sexual promiscuity was not particularly bad. And the person in charge of the investigation himself believes that lying and cheating is a "normal way of life."

Regarding the serious state of American juvenile delinquency, the American ruling group and its paid scholars deliberately avoid stating its true root causes, and instead create various fallacies. Some describe juvenile delinquency as the inherent mental state of children, "innate hostility," and "innate aggression"; others attribute it to physiological defects, such as "imbalanced glandular development" and "unhealthy teeth." In their writings, the Gluecks, who are considered experts on child problems in the United States, said this: "A human being can be a criminal from birth... In the early stages of their lives, they will have a high degree of criminality..." The reason why these American bourgeois paid scholars have created these absurd and bizarre arguments is nothing more than to defend the real root cause of this "crime wave" - the "American way of life" and war propaganda. However, honest people in the United States are clearly aware of the real reasons for children's crimes and are bravely exposing them. American writer Cohn is one of those who refutes these fallacies. He said: "Currently, almost all books on juvenile delinquents in the United States do not mention the impact of the 'Cold War' atmosphere that shrouds this country on children and young people. You can read these so-called research books one by one, but you cannot find any mention of the impact of the increasing domestic tension, fear, and oppression on American youth; nor does it mention the widespread unrest, cynicism, and hedonism, or the plans of the military and political authorities (these plans are to create what Major General Lewis Hershey called 'a whole generation of killers' for the purposes of war') on them... These scholars who should be concerned about children's issues... They even refuse to talk about the so-called mass entertainment that cruelly affects children, which is filled with violence, brutality, and sudden death."

One of the things that poisons children is the horror comics. Now the circulation of these comics has reached an alarming level. The negative impact on children is incalculable. Cohn pointed out: Comic books sell as many as 100 million copies per month in the United States, 98 percent of American children are regular readers of comic books, and they read an average of 20 to 25 books each month. What are these books? They are: "Horror Adventures," "Famous Crimes," "Criminal Secrets," "Atomic War," "Killer Heroes," "Strange Horror," "War Adventures," "Surgical Murderers," and "Amazing Crimes," etc. Cohn said: "These comic books depict cruel killings, erotic abuse, and absurd and bizarre adventures. All of this meets the needs of the Cold War, because it can make millions of American youth accustomed to the concepts of violence, brutality, and sudden death."

Another tool that poisons the minds of children is television programs that promote war and crime. It is estimated that there are more than 20 million children in the United States who regularly watch television. A group of American educators, when talking about the impact of those televisions on children, made the following comments:

"Due to the increase in the number and scope of insane murder cases, these television viewers have become accustomed to the absurd and bizarre... If a teenager sees nothing but unsightly and cruel killings on television every day, then he will be indifferent to the brutality of war and will not protest against it."

School education under the guidance of the U.S. "Cold War" policy is also an important reason for the increase in juvenile delinquency in the United States. School children are often told that "war is about to break out and bombs are about to be dropped at any moment." In his book "The Gamble of Death," Cohn described how children in New York schools and their parents were shrouded in the fear of a non-existent atomic bomb attack threat. A notice to parents of students said: "In order to protect your children from burns when directly exposed to an atomic bomb attack, we ask each student to bring a piece of cloth to school that can cover themselves... His name must be written on the cloth in ink." "Cold War" education puts children in a constant state of tension and creates an unwarranted sense of hatred in them.

From the above, it can be seen that American social education and school education are influenced and controlled by war propaganda and Cold War policies. This kind of education destroys innocent children, destroys their morals, and then puts them in jail or even kills them. In the United States, millions of children's parents are deeply disturbed by this situation of their children. More and more people now realize that it is necessary to first stop war propaganda and the Cold War in order to solve the moral problems of American children.

    美国少年儿童道德的败坏
    葛正杰
    在腐朽的美国生活方式和战争宣传的影响下，美国少年儿童道德败坏已经达到骇人听闻的程度。美国少年犯罪案件连年的急速增加和犯罪性质的日趋严重说明了这一点。
    据美国参议院司法小组委员会的报告说，美国犯罪的少年儿童人数自一九四八年的三十万增到一九五二年的三十八万五千人，一九五三年再增到四十三万五千人。而在一九五四年有犯罪行为的儿童数目达到了一百万。
    美国少年儿童犯罪行为不只在几个大城市发生，而是遍及全国的。少年儿童们成立了各种名目的帮会，并把自己武装起来。例如，据美国报刊的报道，在美国南部的新奥尔良，就有所谓“纳粹冲锋队俱乐部”、“金钢锁帮”、“河鼠帮”等各种名目的少年的帮会组织。他们所使用的武器自棍棒、刀子、枪直到手榴弹。少年儿童的“犯罪潮流”已经发展到这样的程度，以至于在某些城市里实行了戒严或在晚间禁止少年儿童上街。
    从美国少年儿童犯罪的性质来看，其残暴和野蛮已到了令人难以置信的地步。下面是几个例子：一个六十二岁的幸免于死的受害者说，那些少年首先殴打他，后来把燃烧着的棉花绑在他的脚上，并在他身上浇上汽油用火点着后就跑了。在底特律，一个十三岁的孩子罗伯特因为在调整电视机的波长时同他母亲发生争吵，就用枪打死了他自己的母亲。在他母亲的葬仪上他还对别人说，他母亲的死对他来说意味着“一笔很好的收入”，因为他可以继承他母亲的遗产来挥霍了。在法庭受审时，罗伯特交出了十二支雷管手枪、两支BB枪和一支点三零口径的步枪。在纽约有一个青年毒害了他自己的父母。当他发现他的父亲还没有死的时候，他又用强力把毒药倒入他父亲的嘴里。
    所以，连美国“纽约时报”在谈到少年儿童罪犯时也不得不说：“儿童们能成为盗窃、匪徒、耽嗜麻醉品的人和杀人的刽子手真是难以想到的事，但是它却是活生生的事实。”事实不仅如此，在美国生活方式教育之下的许多美国青少年，根本把犯罪当作了普通生活的事情。据美国参议院青少年犯罪行为特别委员会主席汉德里克逊说，去年调查新泽西州大学生和中学生对于犯罪行为的看法：在被调查的数百名学生中，竟有百分之七十五的人认为说谎行骗是无所谓的，百分之十二以上的人认为偷窃行为是可以宽恕的，百分之十五的人认为肆意破坏财物不是犯罪，另外百分之十七的人认为性行为的混乱并不特别坏。而负责调查的人自己也认为说谎行骗是一种“正常的生活方式”。
    对于美国少年儿童犯罪的严重状况，美国统治集团及其御用学者特意避免道出它的真实根源，而制造出种种谬论，有的把少年儿童犯罪说成是儿童们的固有精神状态，“天生的敌意”和“天生的侵略性”；有的把这归因于生理上的缺陷，什么“腺液发展不平衡”、“不健康的牙齿”等等。在美国被认为是儿童问题专家的格鲁克夫妇在其著作中就这样说：“人类一出世就可以成为一个罪犯……在他们生命的初期，就会有高度的犯罪性……”这些美国资产阶级的御用学者所以创出这些荒谬怪诞的论调来，无非要为造成这种“犯罪潮流”的真正根源——“美国生活方式”和战争宣传作辩护。但是，美国的正直人士是清楚地认识孩子们犯罪的真正原因的，并且在勇敢地揭露它。美国作家康恩就是驳斥那些谬论的一个。他说：“目前美国差不多所有研究少年罪犯的书籍，只字不提那笼罩着这个国家的‘冷战’空气对儿童及青年的影响。你一本一本地读过这些所谓有研究的书籍，可是找不着一点地方提到国内日益加剧的紧张情况、恐惧和压迫对美国青年人的影响；也没有提到普遍的不安状况、玩世态度和享乐主义，或军政当局的计划（这些计划是要为了战争的目的创造美国少将鲁易士·赫席所谓的“一整代的杀人者”）对他们的影响……这些本来应该是关心儿童问题的学者们……他们甚至绝口不谈目前那些残酷影响儿童的所谓大众娱乐的东西，这些东西里充满着暴行、兽性和突然的死亡。”
    这些毒化少年儿童的东西之一，就是那些充满恐怖的滑稽画刊。现在这种画刊的发行量已到了惊人的地步。这对儿童发生的恶劣影响是无法估计的。康恩指出：滑稽画刊在美国每月销售一亿册之多，美国少年儿童百分之九十八是滑稽画刊的经常读者，并且每一个月平均读二十到二十五本，这些书刊都是些什么呢？就是：“恐怖的冒险”、“著名的罪行”、“犯罪的秘密”、“原子战争”、“杀人好汉”、“奇怪的恐怖”、“战争冒险”、“手术杀人者”和“惊人的罪案”等等。康恩说：“这些滑稽画刊描绘出残酷杀害，色情淫虐和荒谬怪诞的冒险的内容。这一切都合乎冷战的需要，因为它可以使亿万的美国青年习惯于暴行、兽性和突然死亡的观念。”
    另一种毒害少年儿童心灵的工具就是宣扬战争和犯罪的电视节目，据统计在美国有二千多万少年儿童经常看电视。有一群美国教育工作者在谈到那些电视对少年儿童的影响时曾发表过这样的评论：
  “由于疯狂谋杀案在数目上增加，在范围上扩大，这些看电视的人对于荒谬怪诞习以为常……一个青少年每天在电视中所看到的总是一些不能入目和残酷杀人的事，那末他对战争的残暴也就无动于衷，而更不会提出抗议了。”
    美国“冷战”政策指导下的学校教育，也是造成美国少年儿童犯罪增加的一个重要原因。学童们经常被告诉说：“任何时刻，战争要爆发，炸弹要掷下”。康恩在他的“死亡的赌博”一书中，叙述了纽约学校的少年儿童和他们的父母怎样被笼罩在莫须有的原子弹攻击威胁的恐惧之下。有一份给学生家长的通知说：“为了使你们的子女在直接暴露于原子弹攻击下时免受灼伤，我们要求每个学生带一块能够把自己遮盖起来的布到学校里来……布上要用墨水写上他的名字。”“冷战”的教育使少年儿童的精神处于经常的紧张状态，并且造成他们一种无端的仇恨心理。
    从上所述，可以看到美国的社会教育和学校的教育是受着战争宣传和冷战政策的影响和控制的，这种教育毁坏天真的儿童，毁坏了他们的道德，然后又把他们放在监牢里，甚至加以杀害。在美国，千百万儿童的父母们对他们小孩的这种遭遇是深感不安的。现在已有越来越多的人认识到：必须首先制止战争宣传和冷战，才有可能解决美国儿童们的道德问题。
