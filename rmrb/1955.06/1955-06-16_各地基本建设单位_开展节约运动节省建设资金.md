Xinhua News Agency, June 14th - Basic construction units in various regions are vigorously launching an economy drive to save construction funds for the country. The Northeast Coal Mine System recently, based on the spirit of comprehensive economy, cut some unnecessary and non-productive engineering projects, which can reduce state investment by 15 million yuan. The Xi'an Central Shaft, which is under construction, has cut six engineering projects that do not need to be constructed, and can save a total of 500,000 yuan in construction funds for the country. The Benxi Caitun Shaft can also save 400,000 yuan in investment after cutting unnecessary mechanical equipment in the coal washing plant's coal storage bin. The high-pressure boiler of the Fuxin Ping'an Shaft was originally planned to use foreign equipment, but it has now been changed to use another type of boiler manufactured domestically, which not only does not affect production, but also saves a lot of expenses. The Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, in designing mining area roadways, learned from advanced Soviet experience and changed the originally designed double-hole roadways in the mining area to single-hole roadways, which can save a lot of construction costs and does not hinder roadway ventilation. In the design of civil engineering and welfare facilities, this design institute has changed the past tendency of blindly pursuing "modernization" and being divorced from reality. In the design of dormitories and other civil engineering projects, they adopted the method of using pit wood to replace finished timber and adobe to replace red bricks, saving construction units construction costs.
    In the Huainan Coal Mine, the Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau, which is constructing the Xieji Ji No. 2 and No. 3 Shafts, changed the original design and replaced the permanent roadways built with wooden supports with reinforced concrete supports, and used gangue instead of concrete filling, which can save more than 2 million yuan in wood and concrete costs.
    Basic construction units in Rehe Province, Jilin City, Shijiazhuang City and other places have vigorously carried out economy work. The leading organs of Rehe Province recently re-examined various local basic construction plans, and cut some projects that did not need to be built and could be delayed, saving a total of 1,526,000 yuan in investment for the country. Chengde Waterworks and other units have also cut some construction projects such as auditoriums, office buildings, and clubs that were blindly built without regard to needs and exceeding the current living standards of the people. Many basic construction units in Jilin City have formulated more comprehensive economy plans. Three basic construction units have cut engineering projects that could be built or not, which can reduce a large amount of investment for the country. Under the leadership of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the broad masses of workers and staff of various basic construction units in Shijiazhuang City checked and exposed wasteful phenomena in construction, and actively put forward suggestions for improving management work and reducing project costs. It is estimated that the savings in expenses made by the city's construction department during this year's construction process can equip the country with a textile mill with more than 20,000 spindles. The newly built Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant recently revised four unreasonable designs, which can save the country 225,800 yuan in investment.
    The Shenyang Municipal Urban Construction Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, and Electricity Bureau have also recently cut back on municipal construction projects that can be delayed, and used the millions of yuan saved for construction projects serving industry. In the construction process, engineering and technical personnel and workers are very careful to save money. In the construction of the road from Huanggu Tun to the Tiexi Industrial Zone, the construction personnel used the broken bricks and tiles dismantled locally to pad the roadbed, saving the country more than 7,000 yuan in purchasing gravel. In the construction of a gate on the city's canal, the design was changed, saving more than 10,000 yuan.

### 各地基本建设单位  开展节约运动节省建设资金

    各地基本建设单位
    开展节约运动节省建设资金
    新华社十四日讯　各地基本建设单位大力开展节约运动，为国家节省建设资金。东北煤矿系统最近根据全面节约的精神，削减了一些不必要的和非生产性的工程项目，可减少国家投资一千五百万元。正在建设中的西安中央竖井，削减了六个可不施工的工程项目以后，总计可为国家节省五十万元的建设资金。本溪彩屯竖井削减洗煤场贮煤仓的不必要的机械设备以后，也可节省四十万元的投资。阜新平安竖井的高压锅炉原计划采用国外设备，现已改为采用国内制造的另一种锅炉，这样不仅不影响生产，还可节省很多费用。沈阳煤矿设计院在设计采煤区巷道中，学习苏联先进经验，将原设计的采煤区的双孔巷道改为单孔巷道，可以节省大量建设费用，并不妨碍巷道通风。这个设计院在土木建筑工程和福利设施设计中，改变了过去盲目追求“现代化”、脱离实际的偏向。在宿舍等土木建筑工程设计中，他们采取了用坑木代替成材，用土坯代替红砖的办法，为建设单位节省施工费用。
    在淮南煤矿，承建谢家集二号和三号竖井的淮南煤矿基本建设局因为改变原来设计，将原用木支架建筑的永久巷道改为钢筋混凝土支架，并用矸石代替混凝土填充，可以节省木料和混凝土费用二百多万元。
    热河省、吉林市、石家庄市等地的基本建设单位，都大力开展了节约工作。热河省领导机关最近对各项地方基本建设计划重新作了审查，削减了一些不必建设和可以延缓建设的项目，共为国家节省了一百五十二万六千元投资。承德市自来水厂等单位，还削减了一部分不根据需要和超过目前人民生活水平而盲目建设的礼堂、办公楼、俱乐部等建设项目。吉林市不少基本建设单位已制定了较全面的节约方案。有三个基本建设单位削减了可建可不建的工程项目，可为国家减少大量投资。石家庄市各基本建设单位的广大职工在中共石家庄市委的领导下，检查和揭发了建设中的浪费现象，并积极提出改进管理工作和降低工程造价的建议。预计全市建筑部门在今年施工过程中节省的费用，可供国家装备一座两万多纱锭的纺织厂。新建石家庄热电厂最近修改了四项不合理的设计，就可为国家节省二十二万五千八百元的投资。
    沈阳市城市建设局、公用局和电业局最近也削减了可以缓办的市政建设项目，并将节省下来的几百万元资金用到了为工业服务的建设项目中去。在施工中，工程技术人员和工人都十分注意节约。在修建皇姑屯到铁西工业区的马路中，施工人员把在当地拆下来的破碎砖瓦用来垫路基，为国家节省了七千多元购买碎石的费用。在修建市内运河的一个闸门时，由于改变了设计，也节省了一万多元。
