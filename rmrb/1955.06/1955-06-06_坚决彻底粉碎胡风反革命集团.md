Resolutely and Thoroughly Crush the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
The Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique Must Be Firmly Suppressed
Letter from Zhao Di, a soldier of the People's Air Force: The thorough exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique is a major victory on the revolutionary literary and art front led by our Party; this is not only a victory of ideological struggle, but also a victory of political struggle. From this, we can be completely sure that with the weapon of Marxism-Leninism, any cunning disguise will be revealed in its true form under the demon-revealing mirror.

The counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique are a concrete manifestation of the complex and sharp class struggle during the period of socialist transformation in our country. From Hu Feng's consistent counter-revolutionary activities, I further feel the importance of the responsibility of being a revolutionary soldier. We are the protectors of the revolutionary regime, and we must be more vigilant. Not only must we keep our eyes wide open and be ready to give the enemy a fatal blow at any time, but we must also keep our eyes open and be good at identifying cunning bad elements from all kinds of disguises and eliminate them! Today, we must resolutely suppress Hu Feng, this anti-Party, counter-revolutionary, and anti-people scoundrel!

Letter from Zhang Bangzheng, a worker at the Yucheng Railway Station in Shandong Province: After the publication of the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique", it further confirmed that the reactionary crimes of Hu Feng, this cultural rogue, have been consistent. After liberation, his attack on the socialist cause (the cause of literature and art is only a part) became even more frantic, and his attack on the Communist Party and the people became more resolute. Judging from the revealed materials, this is precisely his "My Struggle" for the past twenty years.

Hu Feng is not only not a real "writer", he is not even worthy of being a citizen of the People's Republic of China, he is a counter-revolutionary element. Therefore, we young people must be very vigilant against him.

Hu Feng, don't fantasize that you will "win". Your "works" and your "theories" have long been unread and unbelieved. We young people will never be fooled by you again, because today's era is different. Take us workers, who you despise, for example. A few months ago, when we saw articles criticizing you, we still thought your problem was an ideological problem. Now we know that you are a counter-revolutionary element.

In the struggle against Hu Feng, there are too many things that can be done, and now it is just the beginning. Our working class must also participate!

We support the resolution of the Joint Expanded Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to remove Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress and deal with him according to law based on his reactionary crimes.

Letter from Yi Taiheng of the Survey and Design Team of Baotou Iron and Steel Company: We saw the materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party clique exposed in the newspaper at the construction site. After reading these materials, I deeply felt how vicious and insidious the class enemies hidden inside the revolutionary camp are. We must not tolerate the crimes of Hu Feng, who wore the cloak of Marxism and once deceived and poisoned many of our young people. In the capacity of a citizen, I suggest that the relevant authorities revoke Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress and punish him severely according to law. Those who have mixed with Hu Feng and participated in his conspiracy activities should honestly explain the problems and bow their heads to the people and admit their guilt. Now is the time for you to turn back, don't cut yourselves off from the people.

Letter from Tian Jianhui, a worker at the Zhongshan Park Management Office in Qingdao, Shandong Province: In order to ensure the bumper harvest of fruit trees and increase more wealth for the country, our workers are carrying out gardening work with the highest degree of enthusiasm. I saw the second batch of materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, and I couldn't suppress the anger and hatred in my heart. Hu Feng is the enemy of our working class. He has planned to organize his reactionary clique, under the banner of Marxism and wearing the cloak of revolution, to carry out anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. This is a serious counter-revolutionary political issue. According to the second batch of materials, Hu Feng is a thorough counter-revolutionary element. Therefore, I request the government to handle the case according to the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries in order to uphold national laws and discipline. To condone Hu Feng is to harm the interests of the people and to harm the revolutionary cause.

Letter from Cai Ningsheng, from the attached Workers and Peasants' Quick Training Middle School of Central China Normal College: After reading the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique", I couldn't suppress the anger in my heart. Why? Because I am an ordinary Chinese citizen, and I have a heart that loves the motherland, loves the Party, and loves Chairman Mao!

In the secret letters that Hu Feng wrote to the members of his anti-Party clique, there was a gloomy and murderous atmosphere. Sometimes he called on his henchmen to "penetrate a little in a blitzkrieg", sometimes he warned them: "A lot of blood has been shed, but in the future, we can learn some tactics and shed as little as possible. We would rather stay in the cave with bad air for a longer time to 'preserve our strength'", and sometimes he shouted: "The gap has been opened, it's very tense." After the attack failed, he said in a persuasive tone: "Don't be painful, stay calm... everything is for the cause, for a more distant future." This is how Hu Feng directed his henchmen day and night to fight against the Party and against the people. However, the "cause" mentioned by Hu Feng was to eliminate the Party; the "more distant future" was to restore the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

I sincerely support the resolution of the Joint Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association! And I suggest revoking Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress, and request the Supreme People's Procuratorate to make necessary decisions on Hu Feng's crimes. For such heinous counter-revolutionary elements, there is only suppression, only severe punishment!

Letter from Cheng Rushan of the Second Industrial Bureau of Shenyang City: I am a person who does not understand literature and art. After I read the materials published in the "People's Daily" twice exposing Hu Feng and his clique, I saw that Hu Feng is by no means a "writer" or a "literary and art worker", he is a thorough counter-revolutionary criminal. Hu Feng and his clique, disguised and hidden, clamored to "preserve their strength" and to restore the counter-revolutionary forces in China, which the Chinese people will never allow.

The Hu Feng clique frantically attacked the Party and slandered and abused the Party and the responsible comrades of the Party and progressive writers. In the letters from Hu Feng to his clique members, they gave many slanderous and abusive code names to the Party and the responsible comrades of the Party. Isn't this the code used by counter-revolutionary elements?

The materials exposing Hu Feng aroused my immense anger. We must not allow such counter-revolutionary elements to continue to be at large. We demand that the crimes of Hu Feng and his clique be thoroughly investigated and liquidated, and that this counter-revolutionary element be ruthlessly and severely suppressed, and that this counter-revolutionary clique be completely annihilated.

At the same time, we must be a hundred times more vigilant and be good at seeing through any new tricks the enemy wants. We must seriously warn the members of the Hu Feng clique: there is no hiding place for counter-revolutionary elements on the land of the bright New China. Like any counter-revolutionary elements, they cannot escape the giant palm of the people. Only surrendering to the people, bowing their heads to admit their guilt and making a thorough confession is their only way out. Stubborn resistance will be eliminated.

Letter from Li Weimin, a Chinese student studying at the Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology in Moscow: The materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique nakedly expose the despicable face of Hu Feng, the chief culprit of counter-revolution. Although we have read in Pravda the news about the removal of Hu Feng from the literary and art ranks; although many people have said what we were thinking for us, our angry feelings cannot be calmed down.

We students studying abroad have been paying attention to the criticism of Hu Feng's erroneous thoughts, but it was not until the "People's Daily" published the materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique that we recognized Hu Feng's true face. These materials are ironclad evidence of the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is organized to attack the revolutionary cause. They attempt to "shatter" the revolutionary "iron wall". Even after the crimes were exposed, they still want to "defend as attack" and "preserve their strength", and want to plunge our people into the abyss of pain and darkness once again. They are really guilty of heinous crimes. We believe that every Chinese will rise up to condemn the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. In order to ensure the victory of the revolution, we must wipe out the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in one fell swoop. We must also warn other counter-revolutionary elements of all kinds that the iron wall of the people and the iron wall of the revolution will never be "shattered"; what will be "shattered" are only the dirty and stinking heads of those counter-revolutionary guys.

Hu Feng Elements Must Thoroughly Explain the Problem

Letter from Gu Zhaoyuan of the Cultural Center of Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province: I am a staff member of the Cultural Center. I have been paying attention to the criticism of Hu Feng's reactionary literary and artistic thoughts since the beginning. However, because I only have a junior high school education and lack knowledge of literary and artistic theory, and what Hu Feng wrote is obscure and difficult to understand, it has been difficult for me to criticize Hu Feng. I used to think that Hu Feng's articles were difficult to understand because Hu Feng's level was high and he wrote deeply. Now I know that Hu Feng originally had ulterior motives. Only when he could not say what he wanted to say as he pleased did he write in a rough and incomprehensible way. On the contrary, when he communicated and spoke with people in his group, his writing was very smooth, and his words were very clear and understandable. When I read Hu Feng and his group members' full pages of "private words" and saw how much they hated the revolution, the people, and the Chinese Communist Party that leads us, I was very angry, and I resolutely want to denounce this conspirator, the great enemy of the Party and the people.

Now that things are so clear, Hu Feng can no longer cover up his disguise. I request that his qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress be revoked. We can no longer entrust such an enemy to be a deputy to the National People's Congress. We must not allow such class aliens to exist in our ranks, and we must wash him out of the ranks of the people. Other members of the Hu Feng clique must bow their heads to the Party and the people, confess their crimes to the people thoroughly, which is the only way out.

Letters from Zhang Xiaolou, a 67-year-old retired worker from the Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company, and Zhang Dahong, deputy secretary of the Second Street Branch of the Shanghai Dongchang District Youth League: Our 600 million people are determined to liberate Taiwan, unanimously obey the leadership of the Party, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and eliminate the last obstacles for our China to carry out socialist peaceful construction, while the Hu thief (Feng), who is not of our race, is crazy, organizing an anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary clique, establishing strongholds in major cities across the country, widely spreading ideological germs, confusing young people, and sneaking into the Party to steal documents and probe for intelligence, frantically attacking the Party, undermining the leadership of the Party, and resolutely being the enemy of our 600 million people. If the Hu thief's conspiracy clique is not eradicated, the people will suffer serious harm. The Hu thief regards the Party and the people as mortal enemies, and we and the Hu thief are sworn enemies. We cherish the New China established by the 600 million people, cherish the Chinese Communist Party that leads the 600 million people to advance victoriously, and fully support the resolution of the Joint Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to remove Hu Feng from all positions in the literary and art circles, and suggest revoking Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress and taking necessary measures against his counter-revolutionary crimes. And urge Hu Feng's members to thoroughly confess and start a new life. Any deceptive mask cannot be covered!

Letter from Huang Shubin of Chongqing City, Sichuan Province: Since the criticism of Hu Feng's literary and artistic thoughts began, I initially thought that Hu Feng's problem was only a problem of bourgeois idealistic literary and artistic thought and theory. After I read Hu Feng's false self-criticism "My Self-Criticism" and the materials revealed by Shu Wu "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique", I was shocked to find that Hu Feng was a big rogue, a big liar, a big scoundrel, and a conspirator with ulterior motives who hid a knife in his smile. It aroused my great indignation and deep hatred.

From the materials revealed in Shu Wu's article, it can be completely seen that Hu Feng's problem is no longer a problem of literary and artistic thought, but a political problem, a problem of opposing the revolution. The important characteristic of Hu Feng's conspiracy activities is: sneaking into the revolutionary ranks, disguising a revolutionary face, wearing a Marxist cloak, and raising the banner of revolutionary realism literature and art, actively and consistently carrying out anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary criminal activities in our cultural field. As a voter in Sichuan Province and a staff member of a state organ, I request the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress to suggest that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress revoke Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress in accordance with the law.

The members of the Hu Feng anti-Party and anti-people clique should, like Shu Wu, expose Hu Feng's crimes. They should take off their masks, reveal the truth, and provide more materials to the Party, hand over Hu Feng's secret letters to help the Party thoroughly investigate the entire situation of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique.

Letter from Chen Huizhen and nine other returned overseas Chinese from Beijing: After reading the two batches of materials on the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng and his clique, we were extremely indignant!

We are young overseas Chinese who have returned from thousands of miles away from our motherland. We love the Party as much as we love our own parents, because only the Party can lead us to light and happiness. However, the hidden counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng has been undermining the revolutionary cause of the motherland for a long time. On the one hand, he used the "Sun Wukong tactic of sneaking into the belly" to send his henchmen to sneak into the Party and revolutionary ranks, carrying out "external attacks and internal responses", and on the other hand, he used the whip "wrapped in rubber with steel wires", "cluster grenades" and other fierce weapons to launch a large-scale attack on the Party, the people, the revolutionary cause and the literary and art circles. Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people purpose is consistent with that of the US and Chiang Kai-shek. The difference is that Hu Feng disguises his counter-revolutionary conspiracy with a revolutionary posture. Therefore, such an enemy is more insidious and vicious. Hu Feng, this heinous counter-revolutionary element, cannot be forgiven by the 600 million people of the country (including the vast number of young overseas Chinese)! We fully support the resolution of the Joint Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on May 25. We further request that the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng be arrested and brought to justice according to law. All Hu Feng elements should thoroughly confess to the Party and the people and start a new life!

Letter from Hua Jia and twenty-two other people from the South China Cadre Sanatorium: We are a group of cadres who are recuperating in a certain place in South China. Among us are Party and government officials, military personnel, judicial workers, literary and art workers, educators, and health workers. When we were recuperating, we read the materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party clique's anti-people and counter-revolutionary activities exposed in the "People's Daily", and we were all very angry.

Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes have shown that the Hu Feng issue is not only a problem in the literary and art circles, nor is it only an ideological problem, but a serious political problem. Hu Feng has been hiding in the revolutionary ranks for a long time, using the tactic of "sneaking into the belly" strategically, trying to undermine our revolutionary cause from within. Hu Feng, this counter-revolutionary conspirator, has always been wearing the cloak of Marxism, using our newspapers and periodicals to deceive young people and the people. Therefore, it is completely necessary to uncover Hu Feng's "painted skin", peel off Hu Feng's disguise, and expose Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary true face in front of the broad masses of the people. Only in this way can we thoroughly defeat the Hu Feng anti-Party clique and eliminate the poison of Hu Feng's thoughts.

We support the resolution of the Joint Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association: resolutely clean up Hu Feng, revoke his qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress, and deal with Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes according to law. As for the members of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, they should be completely awakened today. Only by honestly exposing Hu Feng and being loyal to the people and loyal to the motherland is the only way out. (Attached picture)

    坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    对胡风反革命集团要进行坚决的镇压
    人民空军战士赵狄来信：对胡风反党集团的彻底揭露，是我们党所领导的革命文艺战线上的重大胜利；这不但是思想斗争的胜利，更是政治斗争的胜利。从这里我们完全可以肯定，我们有了马克思列宁主义这一武器，任何狡猾的伪装，都要在照妖镜下显出原形的。
    胡风反党集团的反革命活动，是我国在进行社会主义改造时期，阶级斗争复杂尖锐的具体表现。从胡风一贯的反革命活动中，我进一步感到作为一个革命军人责任的重大。我们是革命政权的保卫者，我们一定要更加提高革命警惕，不但要瞪大眼睛，时刻准备给敌人以歼灭性的打击；更要擦亮眼睛，善于从形形色色的伪装中，把狡诈的坏分子辨别出来，把它们清除出去！在今天，我们对于胡风这一反党、反革命、反人民的恶棍，我们要进行坚决的镇压！
    山东省禹城火车站工人张邦正来信：“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”公布后，更证实了胡风这个文化恶棍的反动罪行是一贯的。解放后，他对社会主义事业（文艺事业只是一部分）的进攻更加疯狂了，对共产党和人民的进攻更加坚决了。从揭露的材料看，这正是他二十年来的“我的奋斗”。
    胡风不但不是真正的“作家”，就连一个中华人民共和国的公民也不配，他是一个反革命分子。因此，我们青年人，对他就得十分警惕。
    胡风，别幻想你会“胜利”，你的“著作”、你的“理论”，早就没人看，没人信了。我们年青人决不会再上你的当，因为今天时代不同了。就拿被你轻视的我们工人来说，几个月前，看到批判你的文章，还当你的问题是思想问题，现在知道你是反革命分子了。
    在反胡风的斗争中，可做的事情太多啦，现在只是开始。我们工人阶级也一定要参加进去！
    我们拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并根据他的反动罪行，依法处理。
    包头钢铁公司勘测总队易泰亨来信：我们在工地上，看到了报纸所揭发的关于胡风反党集团的材料。看了这些材料，我深切地感到隐藏在革命阵营内部的阶级敌人是多么地恶毒和阴险。我们对于披着马克思主义外衣，曾经欺骗和毒害过我们不少青年的胡风的罪行，是决不能容忍的。我以一个公民的资格，建议有关机关，撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，依法给以严惩。曾经和胡风混在一起、参加他的阴谋活动的人，应该老老实实地交代问题，向人民低头认罪。现在是你们回头是岸的时候，不要自绝于人民。
    山东省青岛市中山公园管理所工人田剑辉来信：为了保证果树丰产，给国家增加更多的财富，我们工人正以最高度的积极性进行着园艺工作。我看到了关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料，真抑止不住心头的愤怒和仇恨。胡风是我们工人阶级的敌人。他是有计划地组织他的反动集团，打着马克思主义旗帜，披着革命的外衣，来进行反党反人民反革命的活动。这是严重的反革命政治问题。根据第二批材料证实胡风是彻头彻尾的反革命分子。因此要求政府，按照惩治反革命条例，予以法办，以正国家法纪。谁姑息了胡风就是损害了人民的利益，就是损害了革命事业。
    华中师范学院附设工农速成中学蔡宁生来信：看完了“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”，我怎地也按不住心头的怒火。这是为什么？因为我是一个普通的中国公民，我有着一颗热爱祖国、热爱党、热爱毛主席的心！
    在胡风写给他的反党集团分子的那些密信里，真是阴气森森、杀气腾腾。他时而号召他的喽啰们要“突击式地刺入一点”，时而告戒他们：“血流得不少了，但以后就可以学得战术一些，尽量少流，宁愿在空气坏的洞中多待，‘保存力量’”，时而又大喊：“缺口已打开了，紧张得很”。等到进攻失败后，又用劝告的口吻说：“不要痛苦，千万冷静……一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来”。胡风就是这样地夜以继日地指挥着他的喽啰们，向党作战，向人民作战。但是，胡风所说的“事业”就是要消灭党；所说的“更远大的未来”就是要恢复国民党反动派黑暗的统治。
    我衷心地拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议！并建议撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格，要求最高人民检察院对胡风的罪行作出必要的处理。对于这样罪大恶极的反革命分子，只有镇压，只有严办！
    沈阳市第二工业局成汝杉来信：我是一个不懂文艺的人。当我看了“人民日报”上两次登载了揭发胡风及其集团的材料之后，使我看到：胡风绝不是什么“作家”，什么“文艺工作者”，他是一个彻头彻尾的反革命罪犯。胡风及其集团，伪装隐蔽，扬言要“保存力量”，要使反革命势力在中国复辟，这是中国人民决不能允许的。
    胡风集团疯狂地攻击党，污蔑谩骂党和党的负责同志和进步的作家们。在胡风给他的集团人员的信件中，给党和党的负责同志起了很多污蔑谩骂的代号，这不是反革命分子用的密码又是什么？
    揭发胡风的材料激起了我的万分愤怒。我们坚决不能容许这样的反革命分子继续消遥法外，我们要求对胡风及其集团的罪行彻底追查清算，无情地，严厉地镇压这个反革命分子，彻底歼灭这个反革命集团。
    同时，我们更要百倍地提高警惕，善于识破敌人要的任何新花招。我们要严重警告胡风集团分子：在光天化日的新中国的大地上，是没有反革命分子藏身之地的，同任何反革命分子一样，他们是难逃出人民的巨掌的。只有向人民缴械投降，低头认罪并彻底坦白才是他们的唯一出路，顽固抵抗就要被消灭。
    我国在莫斯科门德列也夫化工学院的留学生李巍岷来信：胡风反革命集团的材料赤裸裸地揭露了胡风这个反革命首恶分子的卑鄙面貌。虽然我们在真理报上已经读到关于清除胡风出文艺队伍的消息；虽然已有很多人替我们说出了心里的话，但我们的愤怒心情，却仍然不能平静下去。
    我们留学国外的学生一直在注视着对胡风错误思想的批判，但在“人民日报”发表了关于胡风反革命集团的材料后，才使我们认清了胡风的真实面貌。这些材料是胡风集团反革命活动的铁证。胡风反革命集团是有组织地向革命事业进攻的，他们企图把革命的“铁壁”“击碎”。甚至罪行被揭发以后，还要“以守为攻”，“保存实力”，想把我国人民再一次抛入痛苦黑暗的深渊。他们真是罪大恶极了。我们相信每一个中国人，都会起来声讨胡风反革命集团的。为了保障革命的胜利，我们要把胡风反革命集团一网打尽。我们还要警告其他各色各样的反革命分子，人民的铁壁，革命的铁壁，是永远不会被“击碎”的；被“击碎”的只是那些反革命家伙脏臭的头颅。
    胡风分子必须彻底交代问题
    浙江省海盐县文化馆顾兆元来信：我是文化馆的工作人员，这次开展对胡风反动文艺思想的批判，从开始我就一直注意的。但由于自己只具有初中程度的文化水平，在文艺理论方面知识很欠缺，而胡风所写的又尽是一些晦涩难懂的东西，所以自己一直很难下笔对胡风进行批判。以前我一直认为胡风文章难懂，是因胡风的水平高，写得深。现在才知道胡风原来是别有用心的，只有当他不能称心如意地说出他要说的话的时候，他才写得疙里疙瘩，让人看不懂。相反的，他同自己集团的人通信说话的时候，他的文字就很通顺了，话说的很清楚明白了。我看了胡风和他的集团成员的满篇满篇的“私房话”，看到他们对革命，对人民，对领导我们的中国共产党是那么仇恨时，非常愤怒，我坚决要斥责这一个阴谋家、党和人民的大敌人。
    现在事情已这样的清楚，胡风再伪装也遮盖不住的了。我要求撤销他的全国人民代表大会的代表资格，我们再也不能委托他这样的敌人来当全国人民代表大会的代表了。在我们的队伍里绝不容许这种阶级异己分子存在，我们必须把他从人民的队伍中清洗出去。胡风集团的其他成员，必须向党和人民低头认罪，向人民彻底坦白他们的罪行，才是唯一的出路。
    上海中华书局六十七岁退休老年工人张筱楼和青年团上海市东昌区第二街道支部副书记章大鸿来信：我们六亿人民，决心解放台湾，一致服从党的领导，消灭蒋匪卖国集团，肃清我们中国进行社会主义和平建设的最后障碍，而胡贼（风），非我族类，丧心病狂，组织反党反人民反革命集团，在全国重要城市建立据点，广泛传播思想毒菌，迷惑青年，并且钻进党内偷窃文件，刺探情报，猖狂向党进攻，破坏党的领导，坚决和我们六亿人民为敌。胡贼阴谋集团不根除，人民将受到严重损害。胡贼把党和人民看作不共戴天的仇人，我们和胡贼誓不两立。我们爱护六亿人民建立的新中国，爱护领导六亿人民胜利前进的中国共产党，完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，撤销胡风在文艺界担任的一切职务，并建议撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格，对他的反革命罪行进行必要的处理。并督促胡风分子彻底交代，重新做人，任何骗人的假面都是遮盖不住的！
    四川省重庆市黄述斌来信：开展对胡风文艺思想的批判以来，最初我认为，胡风的问题仅不过是资产阶级唯心主义文艺思想和理论的问题。当我读了胡风的假检讨“我的自我批判”及舒芜所揭露“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”后，大吃一惊，原来胡风是一个笑里藏刀的大流氓、大骗子、大恶棍、别有用心的阴谋家。激起我万分愤慨和切齿痛恨。
    从舒芜的文章所揭发的材料，完全可以看出，胡风的问题，已完全不是什么文艺思想问题，而是政治问题，是反对革命的问题。胡风阴谋活动的重要特点是：钻进革命队伍中来，伪装革命的面貌，披着马克思主义外衣，打起革命现实主义文艺旗号，积极地、一贯地在我们文化领域内进行反党、反人民、反革命的罪恶活动。作为四川省的一个选民和国家机关工作人员的我，要求四川省人民代表大会建议全国人民代表大会常务委员会依法撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格。
    胡风反党、反人民集团的分子，应当像舒芜那样，揭发胡风罪行。应剥去假面，揭露真象，应当向党提供更多的材料，把胡风的密信交出来，以帮助党彻底查清胡风及其反党集团的全部情况。
    北京归国华侨陈慧贞等十人来信：我们看了反革命分子胡风及其集团的两批材料后，万分愤慨！
    我们是从远离祖国数千里以外回来的华侨青年。我们热爱党如同热爱我们自己的父母；因为只有党才能领导我们走向光明和幸福。然而暗藏的胡风反革命分子却长期破坏祖国的革命事业。他一面以“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”派遣其党羽钻进党和革命队伍，进行“外攻里应”，又以“橡皮包着钢丝的”鞭子、“集束手榴弹”和其他凶恶武器来向党，向人民，向革命事业和文艺界大举进攻。胡风反党，反人民的目的是和美蒋一致的，不同的是胡风以革命的姿态来掩饰其反革命阴谋，因而这样的敌人也就更阴险，更毒辣。胡风这个罪大恶极的反革命分子是全国六万万人（包括广大华侨青年）所不能宽恕的！我们完全拥护五月二十五日中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议。我们更要求依法将胡风反革命分子逮捕法办。一切胡风分子，应该在党和人民面前彻底交代，重新做人！
    华南区干部疗养院华嘉等二十三人来信：我们是在华南某地疗养的一群干部，我们中间有党政机关工作者、军队工作者、司法工作者、文艺工作者、教育工作者和卫生工作者。我们在疗养生活中，读到“人民日报”揭发的胡风反党集团的反人民反革命的材料的时候，我们都非常愤怒。
    胡风的反革命罪行，已经说明了胡风问题不仅是一个文艺界的问题，也不仅是一个思想问题，而是一个严重的政治问题。胡风长期潜藏在革命队伍里，是有策略地使用“钻进肚皮去”的战术，企图从内部来破坏我们革命事业的。胡风这个反革命的阴谋家，一向披着马克思主义的外衣，利用我们的报刊，欺骗青年和欺骗人民。因此，揭开胡风的“画皮”，剥下胡风的伪装，把胡风的反革命真面目，在广大的人民面前揭露出来，是完全有必要的。只有这样，才能彻底打垮胡风反党集团，肃清胡风思想的毒害。
    我们拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议：坚决把胡风清洗出去，撤销他的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并依法处理胡风的反革命罪行。至于胡风反党集团分子们，今天应该彻底醒悟了。只有老老实实揭露胡风，忠于人民，忠于祖国，才是唯一的出路。（附图片）
