Chairman Ho Chi Minh's Written Statement at Beijing Airport

Dear Chairman Mao Zedong: Dear comrades and friends:

The delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is extremely excited and pleased to visit the great People's Republic of China at your invitation. I would like to pay my respects to the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China, who are leading the Chinese people in socialist construction and advancing victoriously.

The delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is grateful to the people of Beijing for their warm welcome, and through you, extends our highest respect to the hardworking and courageous Chinese people.

The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the ongoing socialist construction inspire the colonial and semi-colonial people of the East and the world to strive for liberation, and play a huge role in consolidating peace in the Far East and the world.

The Vietnamese people have endured decades of suffering under the oppression of colonialism. With unwavering will and unremitting efforts, they are engaged in a heroic struggle to win peace, unification, independence, and democracy for Vietnam. The Vietnamese people will never allow others to invade them, nor will they ever invade others. The Vietnamese people will always support the struggle against aggression and for the maintenance of world peace.

The Vietnamese people firmly believe that resolving international disputes through peaceful means and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and different ideologies is not only necessary but also possible.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to establish friendly relations with any country on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit, believing that such cooperation is beneficial to world peace and both parties involved.

The magnificent socialist construction carried out by the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, and the various people's democratic countries, and the great strength shown in the struggle to safeguard world peace, make countries and people who love peace around the world increasingly and firmly believe that peace can only be maintained by carrying the cause of safeguarding world peace through to the end.

The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, with the support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, has achieved a great victory and will continue to advance towards final victory.

The visit of the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will undoubtedly further strengthen the unbreakable friendship between the people of Vietnam and China and will be beneficial to world peace.

Long live the eternal friendship between the people of Vietnam and China!

Long live world peace!
