    North China is Surveying a Batch of Small Coal Mines
    The coalfield geological exploration brigades of Kailuan, Fengfeng, Jingxi, Jingxing, Yangquan and other mining areas are starting to survey a batch of small mines that can be built in a very short time. The geological surveys of these small mines will be completed this year and the well construction design will begin. Shaft sinking and installation of some simple mechanical equipment will begin next year. It is estimated that coal can be produced by 1957. This can shorten the time by several years compared to building a new pair of large mines and save a lot of investment. There are many small coalfields in the Jingxi and other mining areas that cannot be mined on a large scale, and the construction of small mines can make full use of these resources. At present, the Jingxi Coalfield Geological Exploration Brigade has determined six small coalfields, including Seshu Tomb, as the focus of exploration. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北正勘察一批小型煤矿井
    开滦、峰峰、京西、井陉、阳泉等矿区的煤田地质勘探大队，正着手勘察一批在很短时间内就能建成的小型矿井。这些小矿井的地质勘察都将在今年完成并开始进行建井设计，明年开始凿井并安装起一些简单的机械设备。预计到一九五七年就能出煤。这比新建一对大型矿井可以缩短几年的时间，并能节省大量投资。京西等矿区有很多小块煤田，不能大规模开采，用来建设小矿井就可以充分利用这些资源。现在，京西煤田地质勘探大队已确定在色树坟等六处小煤田为勘察重点。（新华社）
