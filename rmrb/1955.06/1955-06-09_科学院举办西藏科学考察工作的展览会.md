The Chinese Academy of Sciences held an exhibition on the scientific expedition work in Tibet during the founding meeting of the academic divisions.

The Tibet Work Team was a comprehensive survey team organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences under the leadership of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government in 1951. It consisted of 59 scientific workers from scientific research institutions, universities, and various business departments. Over the course of several years, they traveled long distances and conducted preliminary surveys and research on the natural environment, agricultural production, geological resources, society, and languages of the Tibetan Plateau.

The exhibition showcased the enormous potential of Tibet, the world's largest plateau, in terms of mineral resources and agricultural and animal husbandry production.

The exhibition displayed geological maps of the Kangzang area drawn by scientists after surveying the plateau. It also showcased mineral and rock specimens and fossils collected by the work team, including coal, iron, copper, lead, antimony, tungsten, arsenic, oil shale, asphalt, barite, gypsum, salt, alkali, and borax.

Many exhibits at the exhibition proved that the soil on the Tibetan Plateau is very fertile. Agricultural scientists overcame various difficulties at altitudes of 3,000 to 4,000 meters, enabling the growth of crops that had never been planted on the plateau before. More than 500 varieties of crops and vegetables brought from Beijing were tested at the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station. Among them were tender cucumbers grown on turf beds, "Keshuang" soybeans originally from Heilongjiang Province, specially cultivated Lanzhou "drunk" melons, cabbages, winter melons, as well as excellent varieties of cauliflower and corn from the Northwest, such as Yellow Mazi. These crops appeared for the first time on the Tibetan Plateau and grew very well. For example, cabbages weighed more than 30 catties, and winter melons weighed more than 17.5 catties. Flax, alfalfa, and other crops were successfully planted using Soviet varieties. Agricultural scientists also conducted surveys of water resources in many agricultural areas in Chaxiong in Qamdo and Tunla on the east bank of the Nujiang River. The exhibition also displayed thousands of specimens of various soils, seeds, plants, and livestock collected from these areas.

Tibet is also quite rich in medicinal materials. The exhibition displayed a portion of the raw medicinal material specimens produced in Tibet. Among them were precious antlers, musk, and snow frogs, as well as ephedra, fritillaria bulbs, cordyceps, and various other plant, animal, and mineral medicinal materials. The exhibition also displayed the "Four Medical Books," a teaching material used in Tibetan Lama schools, which is a valuable medical legacy of the Tibetan working people. The exhibition pointed out that in just over a year, the medical workers of the work team conducted thousands of health check-ups and consultations for Tibetans and carried out various medical laboratory tests. They also participated in the preparatory work and outpatient work of the Lhasa People's Hospital. (Xinhua News Agency)

    科学院举办西藏科学考察工作的展览会
    中国科学院在学部成立大会期间举办了关于西藏科学考察工作的展览会。
    西藏工作队是在一九五一年中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会领导下，由中国科学院负责组织的一个综合性调查队，其中有来自科学研究机构、高等学校和各业务部门的五十九个科学工作者。他们在几年中经过长途跋涉，对西藏高原的自然环境、农业生产、地质资源以及社会、语言等各方面作了初步调查研究。
    展览会显示了西藏这个世界最大的高原在矿藏和农业、畜牧业生产方面有巨大的潜力。
    展览会上挂着科学家们在高原上勘查后绘制出来的康藏地区地质图。并展出了这个工作队采得的煤、铁、铜、铅、锑、钨、砷、油页岩、沥青、重晶石、石膏、盐、碱、硼砂等矿物和岩石、化石标本。
    展览会上的许多展品，证明西藏高原的土壤是十分肥沃的。农业科学工作者在海拔三千到四千多公尺的高原上，克服种种困难，使高原上长出了过去不曾种植过的农作物。他们由北京带去的五百多种农作物和蔬菜的品种，都在拉萨农业试验场进行了试验。其中有用草皮床培植的鲜嫩黄瓜、原产于黑龙江省的“克霜”黄豆、特殊栽培出来的兰州醉瓜、甘蓝、冬瓜以及西北花椰菜和玉米中的优良品种——黄马牙等，这些作物都是西藏高原上第一次出现的，而且都生长得很好，例如甘蓝有重达三十多斤的，冬瓜有重达十七斤半的。试用苏联品种试植成功的有亚麻、苜蓿等作物。农业科学工作者并在昌都的察雄和怒江东岸的吞多两地的许多农业地区进行了水利资源的调查。展览会还陈列着从这些地区采集的数以千计的各种土壤、种子、植物和牲畜等标本。
    西藏的药材产量也是相当丰富的。展览会展出了一部分西藏出产的生药标本。其中有名贵的鹿茸、麝香、雪蛤蟆等，还有麻黄、贝母、冬虫夏草等多种植物和动物以及矿物性药材。展览会还陈列着西藏喇嘛学校教学用的教材“四本医书”，这本教材是西藏劳动人民的宝贵的医学遗产。展览会指出了在一年多时间中，工作队的医药工作者为藏民作了几千次健康检查和会诊，进行了各种医疗化验工作。他们并参加了拉萨市人民医院的筹备工作和门诊工作。　（新华社）
