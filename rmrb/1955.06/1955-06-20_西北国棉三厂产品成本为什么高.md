Why are the Product Costs of the Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3 So High?
    Zhu Bo

In the archives of the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry, there are many documents from the Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3 (hereinafter referred to as Northwest Cotton Mill No. 3), including monthly summaries and quarterly summaries. In these summaries, the achievements, experiences, advantages, and disadvantages of production are invariably mentioned, but the waste phenomenon, which is related to the entire factory's production, is never mentioned.

The waste of Northwest Cotton Mill No. 3 is manifested in excessive cotton consumption, excessive electricity consumption, excessive personnel, excessive management fees, and excessive inventory funds. These wastes make the cost of each yarn at Northwest Cotton Mill No. 3 37.6 yuan higher than the average of similar factories in Shaanxi Province; the cost of each bolt of cloth is 2.1 yuan higher. Calculated based on the factory's planned production of yarn and cloth, the annual revenue would be more than 2.4 million yuan less.

From January to April this year, Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3 used three kilograms more of raw cotton per yarn than some cotton mills in Shaanxi, resulting in an additional consumption of more than 68,000 kilograms of raw cotton throughout the year. There are two main reasons for the excessive cotton consumption. One is weak technical leadership, which leads to poor adjustment and control of machinery, resulting in excessive cotton waste. For example, in carding machines and wire carding machines, the gap, airflow, and speed are not properly adjusted by the technicians, and the workers' unstable control of the machines increases cotton waste from broken seeds, chopping knives, and car bellies. The cotton waste rate of wire carding machines even exceeds the indicator stipulated by the Ministry of Textile Industry by 0.3615 percent, resulting in 130 kilograms of additional cotton waste per day. According to incomplete statistics, the cotton waste rate of the first and second porcupine-style and vertical opening machines is 85.6 percent higher than that of Northwest Cotton Mill No. 1. Another reason is the lax production management by the factory's leading staff. The phenomenon of cotton dropping in the workshops is very serious, and some workers throw away white cotton and recycled cotton at random, but this has not attracted the attention of the leading staff. What is particularly serious is that although the factory's leading staff knows about the excessive cotton consumption and the various reasons for it, they do not try to correct it.

The amount of electricity consumed by Northwest Cotton Mill No. 3 is also astonishing. In January and February, the average electricity consumption per 20-count yarn was 207 kilowatt-hours, 26 kilowatt-hours more than some cotton mills in Shaanxi. The most serious electricity consumption is in the spinning workshop. Calculated as 20-count yarn, each yarn consumes as much as 36 kilowatt-hours more than some cotton mills in Shaanxi, resulting in an additional consumption of 1.22 million kilowatt-hours throughout the year, worth 130,000 yuan. There are many reasons for the high electricity consumption, mainly due to poorly adjusted machines and the lack of personnel to manage electricity consumption. In the spinning workshop, each yarn consumes 8 to 9 kilowatt-hours more due to excessively tight spindle belts; each yarn consumes 7 kilowatt-hours more due to excessive suction from the cotton suction device. The workshop and the power department shirk their responsibilities to each other. Workshop managers say that "the power department should control the electricity consumption indicators," while the power department personnel say that "the electricity consumption indicators should be controlled by the workshop." Therefore, no one from top to bottom knows how much electricity the entire factory consumes.

Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3 operates in two shifts. According to the preliminary staffing plan, more than 820 people could be laid off, which is a huge waste! In various departments and workshops, many idlers can be seen. For example, the sanitation department has 36 people, many of whom have nothing to do; the planning department has a total of 15 people, including an assistant to the section chief, four basic construction statisticians who have no work to do, and one annual planner who only prepares the annual production plan once a year. Each branch director has one "secretary" and one clerk. Due to the large number of personnel, more than 30,000 yuan is paid in wages each month. As the saying goes, "The wool comes from the sheep," and increased expenditures lead to increased costs.

The enterprise management fees of Northwest Cotton Mill No. 3 in January and February totaled 141,500 yuan, more than 48,000 yuan more than similar factories in the Northwest. Based on this calculation, the annual expenditure will be 290,000 yuan more. Calculated by the number of personnel in the management department, the average monthly office expense per person is 45 yuan, three times more than similar factories in Shaanxi. The repair costs of this factory are also very high. In January and February, the repair costs of each workshop in the yarn and cloth mill reached 42,300 yuan, 59 percent more than similar factories in Shaanxi. This item alone will result in an additional expenditure of more than 250,000 yuan throughout the year.

As of the end of February this year, Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3 had a total of 2,653 types of overstocked machinery and materials (including those overstocked during the construction of the factory), and the overstocked funds accounted for 58 percent of the factory's total material funds. The main reason for the large amount of overstocking is that the factory's leaders at all levels have the idea that "it doesn't matter if you buy too much, it's troublesome if you buy too little and it's not enough." Therefore, they want to buy more of everything. For example, 920,000 weft yarn tubes were ordered during the construction of the factory, but only more than 400,000 were actually used; the purchased cylinder oil can be used for ten years, and the solder paste can be used for seventeen years; hundreds of thousands of yarn tubes have been overstocked, and another 170,000 were purchased. Even 500 double beds, 600 single beds, 650 square stools, and 256 vegetable cabinets are overstocked. The supply department does not grasp the fixed quota for the use of machinery and materials and blindly prepares procurement plans. When the factory director receives the procurement plan, he approves it by having the secretary stamp it without even looking at it. The finance department lacks the necessary supervision and control over the use of funds, so it has not been able to stop this waste of funds in a timely manner, resulting in the phenomenon of "someone using funds, but no one managing funds."

The above-mentioned waste phenomena are only discovered from a few major aspects. If a comprehensive inspection is carried out, the problems discovered will be even more serious. The Party and the government have repeatedly called for comprehensive conservation and overcoming waste. Northwest Cotton Mill No. 3 should conduct an in-depth inspection of the waste phenomenon and formulate effective conservation measures!

    西北国棉三厂产品成本为什么高
    朱波
    在纺织工业部西北纺织管理局的档案里，有着很多国营西北第三棉纺织厂（下简称西北国棉三厂）的文件，其中有月总结，也有季度总结。在这些总结里，千篇一律地谈到生产的成绩、经验和优缺点，但是，对关系到全厂生产的浪费现象却一次也没有提到。
    国棉三厂的浪费，表现在用棉多、用电多、人员多、管理费多和积压资金多等方面。这些浪费使得西北国棉三厂每件纱的成本比陕西省同类型的工厂平均高三十七元六角；每匹布的成本高二元一角。以这个厂计划生产的纱和布来计算，全年就要少收入二百四十多万元。
    今年一月到四月，西北国营第三棉纺织厂每件纱还比陕西某些棉纺织厂多用三公斤原棉，全年共将多用原棉六万八千多公斤。用棉多的主要原因有两个。一个是技术领导薄弱，对机器的调整和掌握不好，因而造成落棉多的现象。如清花机和钢丝机，就是因为技术人员对机器的隔距、气流和速度调整不好，再加上工人对机器掌握不稳，使破籽、斩刀和车肚等落棉增加。钢丝机的落棉率竟超过纺织工业部规定的指标的百分之零点三六一五，每天就多落棉一百三十公斤。第一、二豪猪式和直立式开棉机的落棉率，据不完全统计，比西北国棉一厂高百分之八十五点六。另一个原因是工厂的领导工作人员对生产管理松懈。车间掉棉的现象非常严重，有的工人乱扔白花和回丝，却没有引起领导工作人员的重视。尤其严重的，是工厂的领导工作人员虽然知道用棉多和造成用棉多的种种原因，但是却不想法加以纠正。
    西北国棉三厂用电的数量之多也是很惊人的。一月和二月，每件二十支纱平均用电二百零七度，比陕西某些棉纺织厂多二十六度。耗费电最严重的是细纱车间，如折成二十支纱计算，每件纱竟比陕西某些棉纺织厂高出三十六度之多，全年共多耗电一百二十二万度，值人民币十三万元。用电量多的原因很多，其中主要是机器调整得不好和没有人掌握用电。在细纱车间，由于锭带调整过重，每件纱就多用了八至九度电；吸棉器风力过大，每件纱就多用七度电。车间和动力科相互推诿责任。车间管理人员说“由动力科掌握用电指标”，而动力科的人员又说“用电指标应由车间掌握”。因此，全厂到底用多少电，从上到下都是心中无数的。
    西北国营第三棉纺织厂分两班生产。根据初步定员的意见计算，可精简八百二十多人，这是多么大的一种浪费啊！在各科室、各车间里，都可以看到很多闲人。例如卫生科有三十六个人，其中不少人没有事情做；计划科共有十五人，其中有科长助手一名，有根本没工作做的基本建设统计员四名，有一年只编一次年度生产计划的年度计划员一名。每个分场的主任各有“秘书”一人，文书一名。由于人员多，每月多支付工资竟达三万多元。俗话说：“羊毛出在羊身上”，开支多了，成本也就增加。
    西北国棉三厂一月和二月的企业管理费共十四万一千五百元，比西北同类工厂多四万八千多元，以此推算，全年将多开支二十九万元。如按管理部门的人员来计算，平均每人每月办公费为四十五元，比陕西同类工厂的多三倍。这个工厂的修理费用也很庞大，一、二月份，纱布场各车间修理费达四万二千三百元，比陕西同类工厂多百分之五十九。仅这一项，全年就多开支二十五万多元。
    截至今年二月底，西北国营第三棉纺织厂共积压机物料二千六百五十三种（包括建厂时积压的在内），积压资金占该厂全部材料资金百分之五十八。积压多的主要原因，是工厂各级领导人员都有
  “买多些没关系，买少了，不够用就麻烦了”的思想。所以，什么东西都想多买一些。如建厂时共订购纬纱管九十二万只，实际只用四十多万只；买的汽缸油可用十年，焊锡膏可用十七年；纱管已积存几十万只，后又购进十七万只。连双人床也积压五百张，单人床积压六百张，方凳积压六百五十个，菜橱积压二百五十六个。供应部门不掌握机物料使用定额，盲目地编制采购计划。厂长接到采购计划，连看都不看就交秘书盖章批准。财务部门对于资金的使用缺乏必要的监督和控制，因而对这种浪费资金的行为也没有及时加以制止，造成了“有人使用资金，无人管理资金”的现象。
    上述的浪费现象，只是从几个主要方面检查出来的，如果全面加以检查，发现的问题将要更严重些。党和政府一再号召全面节约，克服浪费，西北国棉三厂应该就浪费现象，进行深入的检查，订出有效的节约办法来！
