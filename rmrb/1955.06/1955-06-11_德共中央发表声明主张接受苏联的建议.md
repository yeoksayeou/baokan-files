Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 10th: According to Deutsche Presse-Agentur's Dusseldorf report: The Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement on the 8th, signed by First Secretary Reimann, saying: "The German Communists have always believed that the German people should maintain friendly relations with the people of all neighboring countries, especially the great Soviet people. Historical experience shows that normal relations between Germany and the Soviet Union have always been beneficial to our nation; while hostile relations are harmful to both peoples. Therefore, the German Communist Party welcomes the friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, and the German Communist Party has repeatedly demanded the establishment of normal economic, cultural and other relations between the Federal Republic and the Soviet Union."

The statement demanded that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, in accordance with the vital national interests of the German people and the wishes of all peace-loving Germans, accept the Soviet proposal and quickly implement it. The statement said: "It would be contrary to the interests of the German nation to reject the hand of friendship extended to us by our friend, the Soviet Union."

The statement pointed out that the normalization of relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union would greatly help ease the tension in Germany itself, which would make it easier for the German people to put forward their own proposals for a peaceful settlement of the German question, thereby prompting the four major powers to reach an agreement on the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis. The statement also pointed out that the normalization of relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union is an important step in promoting the relaxation of the European situation and the establishment of an all-European collective security system.

The statement finally called on the people of West Germany to step up their opposition to the "policy of strength" and strive to ease the tension, and pointed out: "Understanding between Germans and international understanding will lead to the reconstruction of Germany into a unified, peaceful and democratic country, a Germany that does not participate in any alliance within the all-European collective security system."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 10th: "Neues Deutschland" said in an editorial on the 9th entitled "Bonn Faces a Decision": "The Soviet proposal gives the Bonn government a tremendous opportunity and practical possibility to put its foreign policy on a path that can save Germany from a new war disaster. If the Bonn government abandons this opportunity, no German will be able to forgive it."

"Neues Deutschland" continued: "The normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic is an unconditional national demand. The implementation of the Soviet proposal will establish equal and good relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic, such as those that have long existed between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. This will greatly help Germany restore its unity in peace and freedom."

"Neues Deutschland" also pointed out that the Soviet Union's proposal to Bonn will undoubtedly greatly help ease international tensions. It concluded: "The broad response to the Soviet proposal in East and West Germany shows that the will of the majority of the German people is unanimous in demanding an end to the imperialist policy of creating hostility, and in demanding the establishment of peaceful, cooperative and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany."

    德共中央发表声明主张接受苏联的建议
    新华社柏林十日电　据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫讯：德国共产党中央委员会八日发表了由第一书记雷曼签名的声明说：“德国共产党人一贯认为，德国人民应该和所有邻国的人民，特别是伟大的苏联人民，保持友好关系。历史经验表明：德国和苏联之间的正常关系对于我们民族始终是有利的；而敌对关系对两国人民是有害的。因此，德国共产党欢迎德意志民主共和国和苏联之间的友好关系，德国共产党也一再要求联邦共和国和苏联之间建立正常的经济、文化和其他的关系。”
    声明要求德意志联邦共和国政府根据德国人民的切身的民族利益和一切爱好和平的德国人民的愿望，接受苏联的建议，并且迅速使这个建议实现。声明说：“如果拒绝我国人民的朋友苏联向我们伸出的友谊的手，那将是违反德国民族利益的。”
    声明指出：西德和苏联关系的正常化将大大有助于缓和德国本身的紧张局势，这种情况将使得德国人民易于提出他们自己的关于和平解决德国问题的建议，从而促使四大国就在和平、民主的基础上恢复德国统一的问题达成协议。声明还指出：西德和苏联关系的正常化是促进缓和欧洲局势和建立全欧集体安全体系的一个重要步骤。
    声明最后号召西德人民加紧反对“实力政策”，争取缓和紧张局势，并且指出：“德国人之间的谅解和国际间的谅解将导向德国重建成为一个统一、和平和民主的国家，一个在全欧集体安全体系中不参加任何联盟的德国。”
    新华社柏林十日电　“新德意志报”九日在题为“波恩面临着决定”的社论里说：“苏联的建议给了波恩政府以巨大的机会和实际的可能性，使它的外交政策可以走上一条使德国避免一次新的战争灾难的道路。如果波恩政府放弃了这个机会，没有一个德国人能够原谅它。”
      “新德意志报”接着指出：“苏联和联邦共和国之间关系的正常化是全国性的无条件的要求。实现苏联的建议将使苏联和联邦共和国之间建立像苏联和德意志民主共和国之间早就已经存在的那种平等、良好的关系。这将大大帮助德国在和平和自由中恢复统一。”
      “新德意志报”并且指出：苏联对波恩的建议无疑地将大大有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。它最后说：“在东德和西德对苏联建议的广泛响应表明：大多数德国人民的意志一致要求结束帝国主义的制造敌对的政策，并且要求在苏联和德国之间建立和平、合作和友谊的关系。”
