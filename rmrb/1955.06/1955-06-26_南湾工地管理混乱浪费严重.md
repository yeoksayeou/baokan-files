To the Editor:

Serious waste exists at the Nanwan Reservoir project. According to the preliminary results of a joint inspection conducted in April by the Reservoir Engineering Headquarters, the Central Ministry of Water Resources, and the Huai River Harnessing Committee, scattered materials and unnecessary equipment on the construction site are valued at 56,734 yuan. This includes 425 cubic meters of lumber, 18,700 meters of sheathed wire, and various rolled steel fittings and other materials. Due to the lack of a strict management system on the construction site, chaos is prevalent. Along the route from Lishupeng (a place name in Nanwan) to Yijiawan, there are 50 overturned and abandoned hopper cars. From Yijiawan to the south of the Chenjiafan Bridge, more than 100 hopper cars are dumped along the roadside and in the river. Steel rails are randomly sawed on the construction site for laying sidings; according to investigations, the consumption of hacksaw blades due to sawing steel rails alone amounts to 1,130 pieces. The canvas tarpaulins on the construction site are frequently crushed by tractors; twelve already damaged tarpaulins represent a loss of 9,100 yuan. Furthermore, there are many materials buried underground. The First Detachment unearthed 90 steel rails, two sets of switches, a large barrel of gasoline, and 100 kilograms of iron nails. Two thousand kilograms of spikes and steel rail fittings were picked up from the ground. This is only what has been discovered; the materials still buried underground cannot be calculated.

The confusion in construction design is also very serious: The original draft design for the Nanwan Reservoir proposed building 300 temporary bridges. Although the planning department later reduced the number of temporary bridges to 200, due to organizational chaos and lack of construction planning, some bridges were built but not used, while others were repeatedly built and demolished, resulting in rework, waste, and significant losses. For example, the three bucket car bridges on the Yangliu River were dismantled before being used. One trestle bridge and two low bridges near the cofferdam were either built at night and dismantled during the day, or built one day and dismantled the next. Furthermore, the five trestle bridges in Wangjiaying were dismantled in late March without ever being used after being built.

The backlog of mechanical equipment is also very serious. Nanwan has 62 tractors for rolling and compacting, but according to on-site statistics, the maximum attendance was 48 units, with a utilization rate of only 76.7 percent, operating for only three to seven hours per shift. Twelve belt conveyors were brought in, but only three were used for seven and a half shifts. Excavators and trenching machines have never been used, and only half of the generators have been used.

The backlog of materials is also very serious. Due to the blind supply from the reservoir equipment supply department and the overly ambitious plans of the construction department, it is estimated that there is still a backlog of 37 tons of iron sand, 24 tons of pig iron, 400 meters of iron pipe, 1,000 flatcars, and 500 wooden bucket cars. High-voltage bare copper wire worth 40,000 yuan was only used for more than 20 days and then left idle. Sixty-three incorrectly purchased high-voltage lightning arresters, worth 6,580 yuan, have been backlogged for years.

The chaos and waste at the Nanwan construction site are intolerable. The leadership at the Nanwan construction site must take effective measures to quickly stop the waste.

### 南湾工地管理混乱浪费严重

    南湾工地管理混乱浪费严重编辑同志：
    南湾水库工程存在着严重的浪费现象。根据今年四月间水库工程指挥部、中央水利部和治淮委员会联合检查的初步结果，工地上散乱的器材和不需要的设备价值达五万六千七百三十四元。其中计有木料四百二十五立方公尺，皮线一万八千七百公尺和各种钢轧配件等物资。由于工地管理缺乏严密的制度，工地上到处呈现着混乱现象。从栗树棚（南湾的一个地名）到易家湾，沿途倾翻丢弃的斗平车就有五十辆，从易家湾到陈家畈大桥南边倾倒在路旁和河里的斗平车有一百多辆。工地上随便乱锯钢轨，铺设岔道，据调查仅仅因锯钢轨而消耗掉的钢锯条就有一千一百三十条。工地上的布篷经常被拖拉机轧坏，已经轧坏的布篷十二块就损失人民币九千一百元。另外，埋在地下的物资也不少，第一支队从地下挖掘出来的物资就有钢轨九十根、道岔两付、汽油一大桶和铁钉一百公斤。地上捡起的扒钉和钢轨配件就有两千公斤。这仅仅是被发现的部分，至于尚未被发现仍然埋在地下的物资就无法计算了。
    施工设计方面的混乱情况也很严重：南湾水库原来设计草案中拟建便桥三百座，后来虽经计划科将便桥核减为二百座，因为组织混乱，施工无计划，有的便桥搭了不用，有的边搭边拆，边拆边搭，返工浪费，损失很大。如杨柳河的三座斗车桥，未经使用就拆除了。围堰附近的一座天桥和两座低桥，一座是夜间搭好白天拆掉，另一座是头一天搭好第二天拆掉。再如王家营的五座天桥，自建齐以后从未使用就于三月下旬拆除了。
    机械使用方面的积压现象也很严重。南湾有供辗压用的拖拉机六十二台，但据现场统计，最高出勤数为四十八台，利用率仅为百分之七六点七，每班只开三小时至七小时。调来十二部皮带输送机，只有三部用了七班半。挖土机、挖沟机从未用过，发电机也只用了一半。
    材料的积压也很严重，由于水库器材供应部门盲目供应和施工部门的计划偏大，据统计现在还积压铁砂三十七吨，生铁二十四吨，铁管四百公尺，平车一千辆，木斗车五百辆，价值四万元的高压裸铜线只用了二十多天也闲置起来，错购高压避雷器六十三个价值六千五百八十元长年积压。
    南湾工地的混乱和浪费现象是不能令人容忍的。南湾工地领导上要采取有效的措施，迅速制止浪费现象。
