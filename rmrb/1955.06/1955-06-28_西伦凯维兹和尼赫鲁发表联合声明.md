Xinhua News Agency, June 27th – According to TASS, Warsaw, June 27th: A joint statement was signed in Warsaw on the 25th by Józef Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People’s Republic, and Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of the Republic of India.

The statement said: The Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Nehru, visited Poland at the invitation of the Polish government. During his visit to Warsaw, Prime Minister Nehru held talks with the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic and other members of the Polish government. These talks showed that both governments share a desire for peace and a determination to maintain peace. The talks covered many issues of common concern to both countries, as well as a wide range of international issues related to both countries. Among the issues discussed was the issue of Indochina; just as Poland and India cooperated in the Korean International Commission before, Poland and India are cooperating within the International Commission in Indochina. The two Prime Ministers welcomed this cooperation between the two countries for peace and for resolving difficult issues through consultation.

Relations between Poland and India have always been friendly, and there are no disputes or problems between them. Recently, our two countries concluded a trade agreement that will help develop mutual trade relations. The two Prime Ministers expressed the hope that these relations will continue to develop in the future on the basis of mutual benefit, and that there will be further economic and cultural ties and cooperation.

The two Prime Ministers fully affirm and adopt the five principles that have been accepted by many countries, and will implement these principles in their mutual relations. These five principles are:

	One, mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty;
	Two, mutual non-aggression;
	Three, mutual non-interference in internal affairs for any economic, political or ideological reasons;
	Four, equality and mutual benefit;
	Five, peaceful coexistence.

The two Prime Ministers expressed particular concern about the situation in Indochina and the new difficulties encountered by the Indochinese countries in implementing the Geneva Accords. They believe that it is extremely important for all countries concerned to fully implement the Geneva Accords and hold elections in accordance with the provisions of the Accords for the sake of peace in Indochina and peace throughout the Far East and the world. In this way, the independence of these Southeast Asian countries can be guaranteed and their mutual relations can be built on a sound basis.

The two Prime Ministers expressed satisfaction that they were able to hold face-to-face talks and exchange views on issues of common concern. They believe that the outcome of the talks will help to further consolidate relations between the two countries, and thus will also contribute to the cause of world peace.

    西伦凯维兹和尼赫鲁发表联合声明
    据新华社讯　波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹和印度共和国总理尼赫鲁的联合声明二十五日下午在华沙签字。
    签字仪式在友好的气氛中进行。签字后，尼赫鲁和西伦凯维兹在热烈的鼓掌声中亲切握手。
    新华社二十七日讯　据塔斯社华沙二十七日讯：波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹和印度共和国总理尼赫鲁二十五日在华沙签署了一个联合声明。
    声明说：印度共和国总理尼赫鲁应波兰政府的邀请访问了波兰。尼赫鲁总理在访问华沙期间同波兰人民共和国部长会议主席和波兰政府其他人员进行了会谈。这些会谈表明，两国政府都怀着和平的愿望和维护和平的意志。会谈涉及两国共同关心的许多问题以及与两国有关的具有国际意义的广泛问题。在讨论的问题中还有印度支那问题；正如以前波兰和印度在朝鲜国际委员会中合作一样，在印度支那，波兰和印度在国际委员会内合作。两国总理欢迎两国为了和平、为了用协商办法解决困难问题而进行的这种合作。
    波兰和印度两国之间的关系一向是友好的，它们之间没有任何争端和问题，最近时期，我们两国之间缔结了有助于发展相互贸易关系的贸易协定。两国总理表示希望，这种关系今后将在两国互利的基础上进一步获得发展，并且在经济和文化方面将有进一步的联系和合作。
    两国总理完全确认并采纳已经为许多国家所接受的五项原则，并且将在它们的相互关系中实行这些原则。这五项原则是：
    一、互相尊重彼此领土的完整和主权；
    二、互不侵犯；
    三、互不借任何经济、政治或意识形态性质的理由干涉内政；
    四、平等互利；
    五、和平共处。
    两国总理对印度支那的局势和印度支那国家在执行日内瓦协定时所产生的新的困难特别表示不安。他们认为：为了印度支那和平以及整个远东和世界和平的利益，各有关国家完全履行日内瓦协定和按照协定的规定举行选举是极其重要的事。这样，东南亚这些国家的独立才能有保证，它们的相互关系才能建筑在健全的基础上。
    两国总理对他们能够进行当面的会谈和就他们共同关心的问题交换意见表示满意。他们相信：会谈的结果将有助于进一步巩固两国的关系，从而也将有助于世界和平的事业。
