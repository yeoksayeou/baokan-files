    Rapidly Advancing Huainan Coal Mine
    Chen Feng
    Huainan Coal Mine, one of China's important coal mining bases, presents a scene of intense construction.
    Large-scale construction of new coal mine shafts and renovation projects of old shafts are underway in exploration and construction. Dozens of drilling machines, scattered across the vast fields, are working day and night to find geological data for the construction of new shafts. This year, drilling personnel will not only provide geological reports for several pairs of new shafts, but also complete geological surveys, measurements, and prospecting tasks in Shangyao and other places where new coal seams have been discovered. Several thousand workers are working intensely on the five pairs of new shafts that have been drilled. The underground tunnel project of Xiejiagji No. 2 and No. 3 vertical shafts, with a total length of more than 8,000 meters, has completed more than 3,600 meters. Several pairs of inclined shafts are also scheduled to start construction in the second half of this year. The railway project leading to the new shafts will also begin construction in July. Three of the original four mines are undergoing renovation.
    The production outlook of the existing mines in Huainan Coal Mine is rapidly changing. Before liberation, there were only three mines here, the mining technology was backward, the output was very low, and the worker casualty rate was also high. Now, there are already four mines in production, 97 percent of the coal mining process has been mechanized, the coal mining volume in 1954 increased by 154 percent compared with 1949; the casualty rate per 10,000 tons has been reduced by 91 percent. This year, Huainan Coal Mine's planned output has been increased by 9 percent compared with 1954. The Huainan coalfield has abundant coal reserves and excellent coal quality, and a large part of it can be used for coking. With the completion of the new shaft construction and old shaft renovation projects, more coal will be produced here, and relying on the convenient water and land transportation conditions nearby, a large amount will be supplied to the economic construction and people's lives in Shanghai and along the Yangtze River.
    In the process of rapid development of coal mine construction, the living conditions of employees are also constantly improving. State-owned department stores, native product companies, and cooperatives have been established in workers' new villages, and employees can conveniently buy daily necessities. In the clubs and cinemas near the coal mines, workers can often watch movies. There are patches of green forests here, which have become good places for workers to hold meetings to discuss production and recreation. Living a happy life, the workers work happily day and night for the construction of the motherland.

    迅速前进中的淮南煤矿
    陈枫
    我国重要的煤矿基地之一——淮南煤矿，呈现着一幅紧张建设的景象。
    规模巨大的煤矿新井建设和旧井的改建工程正在勘探和施工。分布在广大原野上的数十部钻探机，日夜不停地在为新井建设寻找地质资料。钻探人员今年不但要提出数对新井的地质报告，还要在新发现煤层的上窑等地完成地质调查、测量和普查的任务。经过钻探的五对新井，几千个工人正在紧张地施工。谢家集二号和三号竖井的井下巷道工程，全长八千多公尺，目前已完成三千六百多公尺。今年下半年还有数对斜井准备开工。通往新井的铁路工程，也将在七月份动工兴建。原有的四个矿有三个在进行改建工作。
    淮南煤矿已有矿井的生产面貌在迅速改变着。解放以前，这里只有三个矿场，开采技术落后，产量很低，工人伤亡率也大。现在，这里已经有四个矿场生产，百分之九十七的采煤过程已经机械化，一九五四年的采煤量比一九四九年增加了百分之一百五十四；万吨伤亡率降低了百分之九十一。今年淮南煤矿的计划产量又比一九五四年提高了百分之九。淮南煤田煤藏量丰富，煤质优良，很大部分可以炼焦。随着新井建设和旧井改建工程的完成，这里将生产出更多的煤炭，凭借着附近方便的水陆交通条件，大量供应上海和长江两岸经济建设和人民生活的需要。
    在煤矿建设迅速发展的过程中，职工生活条件也不断改善。在一个个工人新村里，已经设立了国营百货公司、土产公司和合作社，职工们能够方便地买到生活必需品。在煤矿附近的俱乐部和电影院里，工人们经常能够看到电影。这里有一片片的绿林，成了工人们开会讨论生产和游憩的好场所。过着幸福生活的工人们，夜以继日地为祖国建设愉快地劳动着。
