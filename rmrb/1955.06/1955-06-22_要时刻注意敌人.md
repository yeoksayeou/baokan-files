    Always Be Vigilant Against the Enemy
    Li Zhun

    After the "People's Daily" published the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," the origins of the Hu Feng gang and their masterminds have been investigated. Who are their masterminds? Their masterminds are the imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the public enemy of the Chinese people! It turns out that Hu Feng, Lü Yuan, A Long, and others, who flaunted the banners of "theoreticians" and "poets," were actually vile counter-revolutionary elements fostered by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. When the Kuomintang bandit gang attacked the liberated areas, they shouted: "If we don't do it, we don't stop; if it's pus, it must be drained!" What vicious counter-revolutionary elements! No wonder they said things like "almost hating everyone" and "I hate this social order" after the national liberation. Yes, counter-revolutionary elements hate our social order. When we read the three batches of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, it was as if we heard them gnashing their teeth at our people's democratic government and all the achievements of New China. The Chinese people also hate their irreconcilable enemies—the counter-revolutionary elements. We demand severe punishment for the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and, in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, severely suppress these counter-revolutionary elements.

    In addition, in studying the "People's Daily" editor's note, I deeply felt that our political awareness was usually too low, and our political acumen too slow. This struggle to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has given us a profound lesson. We were usually too naive, too "bookish," and we regarded the enemy as too simple and too mild. In fact, they were "plotting painstakingly" to "eat us up" at all times! Therefore, we realize that we only have one way to deal with the enemy, and that is to completely eliminate them! Smash them!

    We are grateful to the Party Central Committee for the alarm bells and lessons it has given us in the struggle to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. The words put forward in the "People's Daily" editor's note: "Our people must study, must raise their class vigilance, and their political acumen must be sharper" are of great significance to us. In our revolutionary ranks, especially among some of our young people, who have not undergone rigorous class struggle training, these are precisely the things that are lacking. This struggle has made us aware of the insidious nature of the enemy and made us feel the sharpness of today's class struggle. We must defend socialist construction and always be vigilant against the enemy.

    Under the exposure of the people of the whole country, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has rolled into the "deep grave" they dug themselves, and the Chinese people have "drained" this group of "pus" that had burrowed into the people's ranks. We will not only "drain" this "pus," but also clean up the germs they spread. We have invincible Marxism-Leninism! We have the great and wise Chinese Communist Party, and victory will always belong to us. Any restorationist delusions of counter-revolutionary elements will be crushed by the people!

    要时刻注意敌人
    李准
    “人民日报”公布了“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”后，胡风这一伙反革命分子的来历和他们的主子，清查出来了。他们的主子是谁？他们的主子就是帝国主义和中国人民的公敌蒋介石匪帮！原来打着“理论家”、“诗人”招牌的胡风、绿原、阿垅等人，却是蒋介石匪帮所豢养的万恶的反革命分子。他们在国民党匪帮进攻解放区时，就高喊着：“一不做，二不休，是脓，总要排出！”好恶毒的反革命分子，怪不得他们在全国解放后又说着什么“几乎恨一切人”“对这个社会秩序，我憎恨。”是的，反革命分子对我们的社会秩序是恨的，我们在读着胡风反革命集团的三批材料时，就好像听到他们对我们人民民主政权和新中国的一切成就的咬牙切齿的声音。中国人民对自己势不两立的敌人——反革命分子也是痛恨的。我们要求严惩胡风反革命集团，依照惩治反革命条例，把这些反革命分子，加以严厉镇压。
    另外，我在学习“人民日报”的按语中，深深地感到平常我们政治觉悟太低了，政治嗅觉太迟钝了。这次粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争，给了我们深刻的教训。我们平常太天真了，“书生气”太浓了，把敌人看得太简单和太温和了。事实上他们是在“处心积虑”地时时刻刻想“吃掉”我们！因此，我们认识到：对敌人，我们只有一条，那就是彻底消灭他们！粉碎他们！
    我们感激党中央这次在粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争中，对我们所敲起的警钟和提示出来的教训。“人民日报”按语中所提出的：“我们的人必须学习，必须提高阶级警觉性，政治嗅觉必须放灵些。”这些话对我们的意义是非常重大的。在我们革命队伍中，特别是我们一些青年人，没有经受过严肃的阶级斗争锻炼，正是缺乏这一些东西。这次斗争使我们认识了敌人的险恶，使我们感到今天的阶级斗争的尖锐性。我们要保卫社会主义建设，要时刻注意敌人。
    胡风反革命集团在全国人民的揭露下，滚进他们自己挖掘的“深坟”里去了，中国人民把这一群钻在人民内部的“脓”，“排出”去了。我们不但把这些“脓”“排”出去，还要把他们散布的毒菌打扫干净。我们有战无不胜攻无不克的马克思列宁主义！我们有伟大而英明的中国共产党，胜利永远是属于我们的。反革命分子的任何复辟妄想，都会被人民粉碎！
