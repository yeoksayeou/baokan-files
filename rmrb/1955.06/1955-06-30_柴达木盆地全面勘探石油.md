Comprehensive Oil Exploration in the Qaidam Basin

    Geological exploration activities for oil in the Qaidam Basin have been fully launched. Thousands of geological personnel, including surveying, route reconnaissance, geological prospecting, structural detailed measurement, geological drilling, and geophysical exploration, are working intensively. To date, the various exploration teams under the Northwest Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology and the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau of the Petroleum Administration have found fifteen new oil-bearing structures in less than a month since starting work. On the first oil-bearing structure in the western part of the basin to be drilled, seven shallow geological wells have been completed and will hand over the design data for deep drilling of this structure ahead of schedule. In the preliminary survey conducted by the structural detailed measurement team before the official start of work, it was found that the existing area of a batch of oil-bearing structures found last year was much larger than originally estimated.
      The Qaidam Basin has a vast area. Last year, only preliminary exploration was carried out in a part of the area, and a batch of huge oil-bearing structures and many outcrops of oil-bearing rock formations, as well as oil sand, earth wax, and other direct oil showings were discovered. This year, the number of geological personnel entering the basin has increased by more than five times compared to last year, and the amount of exploration work in the basin has also increased compared to last year. In order to quickly provide ground data for exploration work, aerial surveys will also be carried out in the basin this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    柴达木盆地全面勘探石油
    在柴达木盆地上，寻找石油的地质勘探活动已经全面展开。几千名包括测量、路线概查、地质普查、构造细测、地质钻探、地球物理勘探等不同工种的地质人员，正在紧张地工作。到目前止，地质部西北地质局和石油管理总局青海石油勘探局所属的各个勘查队，在开工后不到一个月的时间内就找到了十五处新的储油构造。在盆地西部第一个进行钻探的储油构造上，有七口地质浅井已经钻成，将提前交出这个构造进行深钻用的设计资料。构造细测队在正式开工前进行的预查中，发现去年找到的一批储油构造的现有面积都要比原来估计的面积大得多。
      柴达木盆地面积广大。去年仅在一部分地区进行初步勘查，就发现了一批巨大的储油构造和许多处露头的含油岩系以及油砂、地腊等直接油苗。今年进入盆地的地质人员比去年增加了五倍以上，盆地的勘查工作量也比去年增加。为了给勘查工作迅速提供地面资料，今年还将在盆地内进行航空测量。　（新华社）
