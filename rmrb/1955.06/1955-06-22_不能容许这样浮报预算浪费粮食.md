Such Inflated Budgets and Waste of Grain Cannot Be Tolerated
    Chen Haiyan

Zhou Lianying, a resident of 15 Houtidi Street, Wuchang, Wuhan, Hubei Province, always raises very fat pigs. Take the four piglets she is currently raising as an example; they are only two months old, but each already weighs over thirty catties.

Why are Zhou Lianying’s pigs so fat?

The reason is simple: because they eat white rice, oily noodles, and sometimes even big steamed buns weighing three liang each, filled with meat or vegetable fillings.

People will surely ask, "Who can afford to raise pigs like that?"

Let's take a look at Zhou Lianying's method.

Every day, the affiliated hospital of Hubei Medical College in Wuchang has a large amount of leftover rice, noodles, steamed buns, and stuffed buns. The hospital's nutrition department catering group considers these "waste" left over by patients. Keeping them in the hospital would certainly be detrimental to "hygiene," but discarding them without "utilizing" them would be a pity. Therefore, an agreement was established between the catering group and Zhou Lianying: on the one hand, the catering group would hand over all the "waste" to Zhou Lianying for disposal; on the other hand, Zhou Lianying would pay the catering group four yuan per month as consideration for acquiring the "waste." In this way, the "waste" was "utilized," and the catering group's "income" was increased, so the person in charge of the hospital catering group felt "clear of conscience"; and since the "pig feed" problem was solved, Zhou Lianying was naturally satisfied.

More than a year has passed since this agreement was established. During this time, Zhou Lianying either goes to the hospital every day to collect "pig feed" or goes every other day. On average, she goes about twenty times each month.

How much "pig feed" does she collect each time? We can take the occasion of June 2nd this year as an example. On that occasion, Zhou Lianying collected a load of "pig feed" from the hospital—that is, rice, noodles, stuffed buns, and steamed buns—weighing a total of ninety-six catties, including the wooden bucket. Even excluding the wooden bucket and the moisture in the "pig feed," there was at least forty catties.

On the one hand, the catering group of the affiliated hospital of Hubei Medical College sells large quantities of leftover food to Zhou Lianying every day to feed pigs; on the other hand, they desperately complain that there is not enough grain to eat. In January of this year, the hospital's two hundred-plus patients "ate" an average of 25.7 catties of grain each. In May of this year, even after the implementation of the household grain verification and planned supply and budget system, the average amount of grain "eaten" by the hospital's patients was still above twenty-five catties, meaning that they "ate" even more than the average healthy person.

So, how can patients eat more than healthy people?

When the reporter raised this question, the person in charge of the catering group gave a definite answer. He said, "Our hospital is different from general hospitals. There are fewer internal medicine patients and more surgery, orthopedics, and ENT patients; there are fewer patients who cannot eat and more patients who can eat, such as workers and laborers, who can eat a lot!"

Is that really the case? The words of a female comrade standing next to him provided an interesting contrast to his words. This female comrade reported, "Today (referring to June 3rd—reporter's note) this morning, four half-eaten steamed buns were found discarded again in the surgical ward."

Is this the "proof" that surgical patients "can eat a lot"?

Perhaps sensing that his words were not self-justifying, the person in charge quickly added, "We admit that there is waste, mainly because we have not educated the patients and staff enough. However, this phenomenon is indeed difficult to avoid. Who can eat what the patients leave behind? What else can we do but sell it?"

Is that really the case? Can't the catering group strengthen the planning of its work and cook rice and noodles according to the needs of the patients? Does the steamed bun have to be three liang each, and can't it be made smaller? Does the nurse have to add a large bowl of rice to the patient, and can't she ask him how much he wants to eat before adding it?

Now, it is the second month of Wuhan's implementation of the household grain verification and planned supply and budget system. Zhou Lianying is still carrying load after load of "pig feed" from the affiliated hospital of Hubei Medical College every day, her pigs are still growing fatter day by day, and the person in charge of the hospital catering group is still trying every means to get more grain. In June, the hospital catering group wrote in the grain purchase budget: number of diners, two hundred and forty-plus; required purchase of rice, three thousand four hundred catties; flour, three thousand four hundred catties; other grains, such as soybeans, two hundred and fifty catties; totaling seven thousand and fifty catties. That is to say, they "estimate" that each patient will need an average of more than twenty-nine catties of grain this month! And in the "Remarks" column of the budget, it is also written that this "is only the most basic figure"! It is especially noteworthy that this budget, apart from saying that there was a surplus of one hundred catties of flour last month and forty catties of other grains, did not specify the amount of rice surplus from last month. According to the catering group kitchen's accounts, there should have been a surplus of more than four hundred catties of rice last month. People can't help but ask, where did these four hundred-plus catties of rice go? According to the same accounts, the surplus of flour last month should have been one hundred and fifty catties, not one hundred catties. So, where did the other fifty catties of flour that were not written on the form go?

Furthermore, since the catering group's own budget also admits that there was a surplus of one hundred catties of flour and forty catties of other grains last month, why do they still write three thousand four hundred catties of flour and two hundred and fifty catties of other grains in the column of "grain to be purchased excluding surplus," instead of deducting these surplus figures, even if they are unreliable as reported by themselves?

Of course, the Wuchang District Grain Section did not approve this "budget," which, although stamped with the seals of the hospital负责人 and the catering group负责人, was highly questionable. Based on the actual situation, the Grain Section approved an average grain consumption of twenty catties per patient this month. For this, the person in charge of the hospital catering group is shouting, "Not enough to eat, what to do!"

Comrade, please don't shout, but first seriously examine your dishonest attitude towards the grain budget system, and thoroughly correct your shameful behavior of wasting grain, which is called the "treasure of treasures," as "waste"!

    不能容许这样浮报预算浪费粮食
    陈海燕
    湖北省武汉市武昌后堤街十五号居民周莲英养的猪总是长得很肥。就拿她现在养的四只小猪说吧，生下来只不过两个月，每只却都已有三十来斤重了。
    为什么周莲英的猪长得这样肥呢？
    道理很简单，因为它们每天吃的是：大米白饭，油汤面条，有时候还可以吃到三两重一个的大馒头和肉馅或菜馅的大包子。
    人们一定会问：“这样养猪，哪个养得起呢？”
    让我们来看看周莲英的办法。
    每天，在武昌湖北医学院附属医院里，剩有大批米饭、面条、馒头和包子。医院营养室伙食团认为这些都是病人吃剩的“废物”，留在医院里当然有碍“卫生”，可是白白丢弃而不加以“利用”也未免可惜。于是，在伙食团和周莲英之间便成立了一项协议：一方面，伙食团把全部“废物”交由周莲英处理；另一方面，周莲英每月交给伙食团四元作为收购“废物”的代价。这样一来，“废物”得到了“利用”，又增加了伙食团的“收入”，医院伙食团负责人当然“问心无愧”；而“猪食”问题又得到了解决，周莲英当然也心满意足。
    自从这项协议成立以来，时间已经过去一年多了。在这段时间里，周莲英或是每天到医院去收集一次“猪食”，或是隔一天去一次。平均每个月总要去二十次左右。
    每次收集的“猪食”有多少呢？这可以举今年六月二日的那一次为例。那一次，周莲英从医院收集的一担“猪食”——也就是米饭、面条、包子和馒头，连木桶在内共重九十六斤。除去木桶和“猪食”中的水分不算，至少还有四十斤。
    湖北医学院附属医院伙食团一方面每天大量卖出吃剩的食物给周莲英喂猪；一方面又拚命嚷着粮食不够吃。今年一月份，这个医院的两百多个病人平均每人“吃”了二十五点七斤粮食。今年五月份，也就是在实行粮食按户核实计划供应和预决算制度以后，这个医院的病人平均每人所“吃”掉的粮食仍在二十五斤以上，也就是说，他们“吃”的仍然比一般健康人吃的要多。
    那末，病人怎会比健康人还要吃得多呢？
    在记者提出这个疑问时，伙食团负责人作了肯定的回答。他说：“我们这个医院同一般医院不同，内科病人少，外科、骨科、五官等科病人多；不能吃饭的病人少，能吃饭的病人如工人、劳动人民比较多，他们很能吃！”
    果真如此吗？站在他身旁的一个女同志的话同他的话成了有趣的对比。这位女同志报告说：“今天（指六月三日——记者注）上午，在外科病房里又拾到了吃剩丢掉的四个半截馒头。”
    这难道就是外科病人“很能吃”的“证明”？
    大概是感觉到了自己的话不能自圆其说的原故吧，这位负责人又连忙补充说：“我们承认，浪费现象是有的，这主要是因为我们对病员和工作人员教育不够。不过，这种现象的确也是难以避免的。病人吃剩了的东西谁能再吃？不卖掉又怎么办呢？”
    果真如此吗？难道伙食团不能加强工作的计划性，根据病人的需要量来做饭煮面？难道馒头一定要做三两重一个，而不能做小些？难道护士给病人添饭一定要添一大碗，而不能事先问他要吃多少，再添多少？
    现在，已是武汉市实行粮食按户核实计划供应和预决算制度的第二个月了。周莲英仍在每天从湖北医学院附属医院挑出一担一担的“猪食”，她的猪仍然是一天一天地长得更肥，而医院伙食团负责人也仍然是千方百计地想多搞些粮食。六月份，医院伙食团在购粮预算表中写着：开餐人数二百四十多人；需购大米三千四百斤，面粉三千四百斤，其他粮食如黄豆等二百五十斤，共七千零五十斤。也就是说，他们“预计”每个病人本月平均需粮二十九斤多！而在预算表的“备注”栏中还写着这“只是最基本的数字”呢！尤其值得注意的是：这个预算表除了说上月结余面粉一百斤，其他粮食四十斤外，并没有写明上月结余的大米的数字。而根据伙食团厨房的账目，上月是应该结余四百多斤大米的。人们不能不问，这四百多斤大米到哪里去了呢？根据同一账目，上月结余的面粉应是一百五十斤，而不是一百斤。那末，没写在表上的另外五十斤面粉又到哪里去了呢？
    还有，既然伙食团自己造的预算表也承认上月结余面粉一百斤，其他粮食四十斤，那末为什么他们在“除结余外需购粮食”这一栏内仍然写上面粉三千四百斤，其他粮食二百五十斤，而不从其中除去这即使是他们自己报的、很不可靠的结余数字呢？
    当然，武昌区粮食科没有批准这个虽然经过医院负责人和伙食团负责人盖了章的然而令人十分可疑的“预算”。粮食科根据实际情况，核定医院病人每人本月平均用粮量为二十斤。为此，医院伙食团负责人正在大叫“不够吃，怎么办”哩！
    同志，请你不要叫，还是先认真地检查一下自己那种对待粮食预决算制度的不老实的态度，彻底地纠正你们那种把被称作“宝中之宝”的粮食当作“废物”蹧蹋掉的可耻行为吧！
