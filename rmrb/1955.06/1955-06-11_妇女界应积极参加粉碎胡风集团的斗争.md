    The Women's Federation Should Actively Participate in the Struggle to Crush the Hu Feng Group
    Cao Mengjun
    When I read the first and second batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily," I guessed that Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary group must be connected with the American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. The third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily" on June 10th confirmed this issue. The Hu Feng group is a part of the American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. They have a political program, organizational principles, operational plans, strategy, and tactics; they infiltrated our some government organs, military organs, cultural and educational organs, and the leadership organs of some mass organizations such as trade unions and the Communist Youth League, and even sneaked into the Party, stole Party documents, inquired about information, and carried out counter-revolutionary activities. "The fortress is most easily breached from within." They "penetrated into" our "liver," plotting to destroy our revolutionary regime from within. Isn't it clear that counter-revolutionary elements like Hu Feng are more sinister, more ruthless, and more terrible than ordinary, overt counter-revolutionary elements? The crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group must continue to be thoroughly investigated, and the members of the Hu Feng group must be given appropriate treatment according to their individual circumstances.
    Our women's circles should immediately and actively participate in this struggle. We must resolutely and thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, and at the same time, we must also ferret out all hidden enemies similar to the Hu Feng group and purify the revolutionary ranks.
    We should learn a lesson from the counter-revolutionary incident of the Hu Feng group: in the future, we must strengthen the internal unity of the revolutionary camp, raise revolutionary vigilance a thousandfold, expose and resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements at any time. If we are negligent and careless again, we will be irresponsible to the people and the revolution. We must resolutely wage a hard and unremitting struggle against the liberalism and individualism in our own ideology. Only by thoroughly eliminating these non-proletarian ideological consciousnesses can we prevent the enemy from exploiting loopholes and can we get closer to the Party and better complete the revolutionary tasks under the leadership of the Party.

    妇女界应积极参加粉碎胡风集团的斗争
    曹孟君
    当我读了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第一、二批材料的时候，我就猜想胡风及其反革命集团一定同美蒋特务有联系。六月十日“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，证实了这个问题。胡风集团就是美蒋特务的一部分。他们有政治纲领，有组织原则，有作战计划，有战略，有战术；他们钻进了我们的某些政府机关、军事机关、文化教育机关以及某些工会、青年团等群众团体的领导机关，甚至混进了党内，偷窃党内文件，探听情况，进行反革命活动。“堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的”，他们“深入到”我们的“肝脏里面”，阴谋从内部来摧毁我们的革命政权。胡风等反革命分子比一般公开的反革命分子更阴险、更狠毒、更可怕，这难道还不明白吗？对胡风反革命集团的罪行必须继续彻底追查，对胡风集团里的分子必须分别情况，给以适当的处理。
    我们妇女界应该立即积极参加这一斗争，我们要坚决彻底地粉碎胡风反革命集团，同时也要把类似胡风集团的一切暗藏的敌人清查出来，纯洁革命队伍。
    我们应当从胡风集团的反革命事件中接受教训：今后必须加强革命阵营的内部团结，千百倍提高革命警惕，随时揭露并坚决肃清一切反革命分子，如果再麻痹大意，就是对人民、对革命不负责任。我们要坚决同自己思想意识中的自由主义、个人主义作艰苦不懈的斗争，只有彻底肃清这些非无产阶级思想意识，才不会被敌人钻空子，才能更紧密地靠近党，在党的领导下更好地完成革命任务。
