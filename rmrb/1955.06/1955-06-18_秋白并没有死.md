    Qiu Bai Did Not Die
    Yang Zhihua
    Twenty years ago today, Comrade Qiu Bai gloriously sacrificed his life!
    Comrade Qiu Bai, with his belief in the cause of communism and his love for the working people, solemnly and calmly walked to the execution ground. When the heinous executioners aimed their guns at him, he nodded and smiled. Qiu Bai, I understand you! You knew that when one person falls, millions would stand up. Qiu Bai, I understand you! You knew the significance of your blood shed for the Party and the revolutionary cause, and that's why you were so calm in the face of the enemy. This is because you knew for sure that the victor would not be Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, but the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party that leads the Chinese people in their struggle for freedom and liberation! History has taken a tortuous path, proving that Comrade Qiu Bai was right: we have won, and the enemy has failed.
    When Comrade Qiu Bai was sacrificed, the Kuomintang reactionaries announced his "crimes," slandering him as a "bandit" and a "perpetual sinner of the nation." They dreamed that Qiu Bai's arrest would lead to the failure of the Chinese revolution, and they arrogantly shouted, "With the Communist bandits losing their leadership, the remnants can easily be wiped out." Twenty years have passed. Who is the "perpetual sinner of the nation" after all? Whose "brutal tricks are seen by the people of the world"? Who is the "bandit"? Who are the "remnants"? Who has been "wiped out"? Lies written in ink cannot cover up the facts written in blood; facts speak louder than words. Twenty years of history has provided a powerful explanation. Today, a small group of Chiang's bandit remnants still occupy Taiwan, committing all kinds of evil. The people of all of China are extremely angry, and the determination and strength to liberate Taiwan can move mountains and overturn seas. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang will certainly be thoroughly eliminated by the people.
    Twenty years ago, the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang killed Comrade Qiu Bai and announced his "crimes," but the local people praised him in unison: "Qu Qiu Bai was shot, that Communist was truly a remarkable hard bone!" "He was even singing revolutionary songs before the execution!" Qiu Bai did not die; he has always lived in the hearts of the working people of the whole country. The people of Changting, Fujian, marked his grave. After liberation, the Party and the government showed great concern for Comrade Qiu Bai, found the person who buried him that year, exhumed Comrade Qiu Bai's remains, and transported them to Beijing. Scientists at Peking Union Medical College sorted out Comrade Qiu Bai's remains, porcelain workers in Jiangxi made a box to hold his remains, and workers in Beijing built his tomb. The working people love Comrade Qiu Bai, just as Comrade Qiu Bai loved the working people, willing to go through fire and water for them, willing to sacrifice everything, even their most precious lives.
    When I learned of Comrade Qiu Bai's sacrifice, I had no tears, only anger and hatred; when I saw Comrade Qiu Bai's remains, I still had no tears, only anger and hatred. This is a class hatred, an irreconcilable hatred with the enemy, a hatred to wipe out the enemy completely!
    The bloody lessons of the martyrs warn us not to be complacent. Today, open and hidden enemies still exist at home and abroad. Strengthening national defense, raising revolutionary vigilance, searching out spies, and preventing attacks and sabotage by enemies at home and abroad are of utmost importance.
    Commemorate Comrade Qiu Bai, and remember this profound lesson. Let the people of all China unite more closely, work together to build an ideal society, and fulfill the unfinished wishes of the martyrs!

    秋白并没有死
    杨之华
    二十年前的今天，秋白同志壮烈牺牲了！
    秋白同志怀着对共产主义事业的信念，怀着对劳动人民的热爱，庄严地从容地走上刑场，当万恶的刽子手架上枪瞄准着他的时候，他还是点头微笑。秋白，我了解你！你知道：你一个人倒下去，千百万人会站起来。秋白，我了解你！你知道你为党为革命事业而流血的意义，所以在敌人面前那么镇定。这是因为你确确实实地知道，胜利的不是蒋介石国民党，而是中国人民，是领导中国人民争取自由和解放的中国共产党！历史走过一段曲折的道路，证明秋白同志是对的：我们胜利了，敌人失败了。
    秋白同志牺牲的时候，国民党反动派宣布了他的“罪状”。污蔑他是“匪”，是“国家民族千古之罪人”，他们梦想着秋白的被捕将会导致中国革命的失败，他们狂妄地叫喊：“共匪失其领导，残孽自易肃清。”二十年过去了，究竟谁是“国家民族千古之罪人”？谁的“残暴伎俩已为全世界人民所共见”？谁是“匪”？“残孽”是谁？谁被“肃清”了？墨写的谎话掩不住血写的事实，事实胜于雄辩，二十年的历史已作了强有力的说明。今天，一小撮蒋贼残孽还在窃据台湾，为非作恶，全中国的人民已经十分愤怒，解放台湾的决心和力量可以移山震海，蒋介石匪帮一定会被人民彻底肃清。
    二十年前，国民党蒋介石匪帮杀死了秋白同志，宣布了他的“罪状”，可是当地人民却是同声颂赞：“瞿秋白被枪毙了，那个共产党人真是一个了不起的硬骨头！”“在枪毙前还唱着革命歌呢！”秋白没有死，他一直活在全国劳动人民的心里。福建长汀的人民在他墓地周围作了记号。解放以后，党和政府对秋白同志很关怀，找到了当年的埋尸人，掘出了秋白同志的遗骸，运到了北京。协和医院的科学工作者整理了秋白同志的遗骨，江西瓷器工人为秋白同志烧了一个盛殓遗骨的盒子，北京的工人造好了他的坟墓。劳动人民热爱秋白同志，正如秋白同志热爱劳动人民，甘为他们赴汤蹈火，甘为他们牺牲自己的一切甚至是最宝贵的生命也在所不惜一样。
    当我知道秋白同志牺牲时，我没有眼泪，只有愤怒和仇恨；当我看见秋白同志的遗骨时，我仍然没有眼泪，只有愤怒和仇恨。这是一种阶级的仇恨，同敌人不共戴天的仇恨，要把敌人彻底消灭干净的仇恨！
    先烈们血的教训告诫我们不能麻痹，如今国内外公开的和隐蔽的敌人还存在着。加强国防力量，提高革命警惕，搜查坐探，防止国内外敌人的进攻和破坏是一件最重要的事。
    纪念秋白同志，记住这深刻的教训。全中国人民更紧密地团结起来，共同为建设理想的社会，完成先烈未竟的遗志而努力吧！
