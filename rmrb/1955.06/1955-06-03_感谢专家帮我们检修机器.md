    Thank you to the Experts for Helping Us Repair Our Machines
    Liu Fubao
    Our Beijing Railway Administration Statistics Factory has over a dozen Czechoslovakian-made tabulating machines, punching machines, and sorting machines. Because we lack technical knowledge in this area, the machines often malfunction. For example, the punching machine was improperly installed, leading to frequent breakdowns and errors in the punched holes. The delivery knife, card box, transmission spring, rotor, and typing hammer of the tabulating machine also had problems, and the alignment of the type bars was incorrect. This caused significant difficulties for our work.
    After the Exhibition of Achievements of Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia opened in Beijing, we invited Czechoslovakian experts to our factory for guidance. Expert Comrade Lebass was truly enthusiastic. When we went to pick him up on the first day, he had just returned to the guesthouse from the Air Force General Hospital. Upon seeing us, he didn't even have a cup of water before hurrying to our factory.
    Soon after arriving at our factory, the expert took off his coat, rolled up his sleeves, and squatted beside the machine to inspect it. He explained as he disassembled it. His work was so meticulous! For instance, when installing the steel rod controlling the typing hammer on the top of the tabulating machine, he checked the level and smoothness repeatedly. He tested each hanger before installing it, and tested again after installation, leaving nothing to chance. In the past, when we encountered a loose spring, we would simply add another spring next to the original one, or cross two or three springs together. The expert, however, carefully tested the spring force time and time again, appropriately swapping or adjusting the length. Every part removed from the machine was wiped clean and oiled by the expert. During installation, every screw was tightened securely. When checking for problems, he meticulously inspected the machine from all sides, inquiring about the machine's usual working conditions. When checking the numerical display action, he specially created a card with regular numbers, checking for errors in the regular numerical action and identifying the source of the problems in the regular numerical display.
    The expert worked at our factory for twelve days. Originally, we agreed to end the work at 11:30 every morning. However, if the work wasn't finished by that time, he wouldn't rest. The same was true in the afternoon, often working until very, very late before leaving. After each machine was repaired, he instructed us to adjust the other machines according to his method. The expert often said to everyone: "When machines malfunction, the work is certainly affected. And when our country is vigorously engaged in construction, this phenomenon is not allowed to exist. Our responsibility is to quickly repair the machines and put them into production."
    We plan to compile and study the explanations given by the expert. We will respond to the expert's teachings and help with practical work achievements.

    感谢专家帮我们检修机器
    刘福保
    我们北京铁路管理局统计工厂有十几部捷克斯洛伐克造的制表机、穿孔机和分类机。因为我们缺乏这方面的技术知识，使得机器常常发生毛病。像穿孔机就是因为安装得不对头，机器常坏，打出的洞经常错误。制表机的递送刀、卡片盒、传送部分的弹簧以及转动器和打字锤等部件也有了毛病，字行杆相接的地方也不正确。给工作造成了很大的困难。
    捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会在北京开幕后，我们请捷克斯洛伐克专家来厂指导。专家雷巴士同志可真热情，我们头一天去接他的时候，他刚从空军总医院回到招待所，见我们去了，连杯水都没喝，就匆匆来到我们厂里了。
    到我们厂没多久，专家就脱了外衣，卷起袖子，蹲在机器旁边检修。他一面拆，一面讲。工作可认真啦！比如在安装制表机上部的控制打字锤的钢杆时，又试水平，又试圆滑，对于每一个挂脚，都是试了再装，装了再试，一点儿也不马虎。过去我们遇到弹簧松了，就在原来弹簧的旁边再加一个弹簧，或将两三个弹簧交叉起来。专家却是仔细地一次又一次地试验弹簧力量，适当掉换或调整长短。从机器上拆下来的每个部件，专家都要擦净上油，安装时，每个螺丝都拧得紧紧的。检查毛病的时候，总要在机器的前后左右仔细查看几遍，追问机器平时工作的情况。在检查数字显示动作的时候，特制了一份有规律数字的卡片，在应当有规律的数字动作中检查错误的动作，在应当有规律的数字显示中找出毛病所在。
    专家到我们厂工作了十二天，原来我们约定每天早上工作到十一点半就结束。可是到点后，如果工作没完，他怎么都不肯休息，下午更是这样，常常弄到很晚很晚才走。每件机器检修完以后，他都嘱咐我们照他的样子调整其他机器。专家常常这样对大家说：“机器发生毛病，工作一定受影响。而当我们的国家正在大力进行建设的时候，这种现象是不允许存在的。我们的责任，是赶快修好机器，投入生产。”
    我们准备把专家讲解的东西整理编写出来学习。我们要以实际的工作成绩来回答专家的教导和帮助。
