    Hebei and Henan Provinces Prevent and Control Cotton Pests
    Hebei and Henan provinces are actively preparing to carry out prevention and control of cotton pests. Hebei Province plans to treat 8 million mu of aphids this year, of which 2.3 million mu are eradication areas. Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang and other regions have successively held aphid control work conferences to deploy aphid control tasks and specific methods. Handan and Xingtai regions have distributed more than 40,000 small powder sprayers to cotton-growing areas. At present, various places have entered the weeding and aphid prevention stage. According to incomplete statistics from nine counties in Handan Region, more than 100,000 mu have been weeded.
    Henan Province held a provincial aphid control technical training class at the end of March and decided to set up large-scale cotton pest control demonstration areas in key cotton-growing areas in seven regions and one city, including Anyang. Anyang, Xinxiang and other regions have also established cotton production protection committees. The production protection work teams have gone deep into the cotton-growing areas to guide farmers in carrying out pest control work. This has greatly increased the confidence of cotton farmers in preventing and controlling cotton pests, and they have purchased pesticides and machinery one after another. Ninety-two agricultural production cooperatives and sixty-five mutual aid groups in Anyang County have prepared more than 80,000 jin of "666" powder and 4,592 pieces of various pest control equipment.

    河北河南防治棉花虫害
    河北、河南等省积极准备开展防治棉花虫害。河北省今年全省治蚜面积计划八百万亩，其中二百三十万亩为根治区。邯郸、邢台、石家庄等专区已先后召开了治蚜工作会议对治蚜任务和具体作法做了布置。邯郸、邢台两个专区已将四万多具小型喷粉器分发棉区。目前，各地已进入除草防蚜阶段，据邯郸专区九个县不完全统计，除草十余万亩。
    河南省于三月底召开了全省治蚜技术训练班，并确定在安阳等七个专区及一个市的重点棉区设立大面积防治棉虫示范区。安阳、新乡等专区还成立了棉花保产委员会，保产工作组已深入棉区指导农民开展治虫工作。因而大大提高了棉农防治棉花虫害的信心，纷纷订购药械。安阳县九十二个农业生产合作社和六十五个互助组，已准备“六六六”粉八万多斤，各种治虫器械四千五百九十二件。（田稼）
