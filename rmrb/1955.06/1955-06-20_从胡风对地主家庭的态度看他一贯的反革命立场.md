    From Hu Feng's Attitude Towards Landlord Families, One Can See His Consistent Counter-Revolutionary Stance
    Hu Feng, originally named Zhang Guangren, also known as Zhang Guangying. His family was a counter-revolutionary landlord family, residing in Shaolong Township and Xishitan Township, Second District, Qichun County, Hubei Province (pre-liberation names were Puti Dam District, Dajingqiao Township). The Hu Feng family had four branches, owning more than 150 mu of land, with over 30 mu cultivated by long-term laborers and 125 mu rented out, yielding an annual rent of over 250 shi of grain.
    Recently, due to the convenience of my work, I met many people in Qichun County who were familiar with the Hu Feng family situation. After comparing the true situation of Hu Feng's family with Hu Feng's praise, admiration, sympathy, and protection of his family and its members, I understood even more that Hu Feng had always stood on the side of the landlord class, opposing the liberation of the peasants. The more I learned about his family situation, the more I could not suppress my anger towards this enemy of the people.
    In the preface and "Postscript" of his notorious "Days of Countercurrent," Hu Feng praised his eldest brother, Zhang Mingshan, as a person with "love, labor, self-sacrifice, and the virtue of admiring good deeds," and said, "...my eldest brother...how much pain did the old society give him, and how did he endure and even overcome those great pains with some extraordinary virtues given to him by the old society." When Zhang Mingshan was killed in 1947, Hu Feng hurriedly wrote articles for various pseudo-newspapers in Wuhan to "seek justice" for his eldest brother, saying that Zhang Mingshan "was born in poverty...was public-spirited and well-regarded among the villagers" (quoted from the original draft of the article Hu Feng wrote for the pseudo-newspapers at that time). Hu Feng used almost all the most beautiful words to praise his eldest brother, even saying, "I cannot write out" his "extraordinary virtues."
    Why couldn't Hu Feng "write out" his eldest brother's "extraordinary virtues"?
    It turns out that Zhang Mingshan, whom Hu Feng called "well-regarded among the villagers," was a heinous bully landlord, known to the local peasants as "Five Poisons," "The Tyrant of Hengfeng Dike." Bi Haiyuan, a 52-year-old poor peasant from Shaolong Township who had been beaten by Zhang Mingshan, said when talking about Zhang Mingshan's character: "His family (referring to Zhang Mingshan's family) had money and power, and bullied others with their influence. Zhang Mingshan was vicious and sharp-tongued, and good at arguing. He was always harsh and abusive to the peasants and kiln workers, scolding and beating them at will." In 1940, Bi Haiyuan built a simple small house on wasteland. Zhang Mingshan insisted that the land belonged to his family, forcibly demanded rent, and even wanted him to host a banquet. Although Bi Haiyuan paid an annual rent of five silver dollars, he did not host the banquet. As a result, the house he had built was destroyed twice by Zhang Mingshan, and he himself was beaten. Bi Haiyuan had no choice but to swallow his anger and host the banquet. Because the poor peasant Zhang Bosheng was unable to pay off Zhang Mingshan's debt for a while, the fishing boat that his whole family relied on for a living was forcibly taken away. Long-term laborers working at Zhang Mingshan's house could only work more and eat less. They had to be diligent in their work and eat quickly. For tenants, the rent grain had to be paid down to the slightest fraction, and they also had to deliver tribute geese, tribute eggs, glutinous rice, and good rice. When Zhang Mingshan was in his fifties, he used his power to rape the wife of a poor peasant and later took her as his own. These materials are certainly far from enough to illustrate the "extraordinary virtues" of Hu Feng's eldest brother, but they are just two or three examples.
      Let's take a look at how Hu Feng boasted that his eldest brother rose from "poverty" through "labor" and "self-sacrifice," and how the entire Hu Feng family "prospered"! In the early years of the "Republic of China," the young Zhang Mingshan, relying on his eloquent tongue and a heart of sycophancy, became close to Zhang Bokai, a local wealthy squire and landlord of the same clan, and became his most trusted henchman. Zhang Mingshan faithfully and viciously helped the Zhang Bokai family collect rent, and many of the collected rents were placed in his home. Zhang Mingshan lent these rents to surrounding farmers and kiln workers at high interest rates; he also borrowed grain and money from the Zhang Bokai family at no or low interest and then lent it to farmers and kiln workers for high-interest exploitation. At that time, Hu Feng's family had already become a "second landlord" and "second creditor" in reality. This was the first batch of capital that allowed the Hu Feng family to "prosper," and it certainly did not come from "labor."
    After the Hu Feng family had this batch of capital, they started a kiln goods business. Within the Hengfeng Dike, there were many lakes and little farmland. Many local people made a living by burning kilns and making pottery. The Hu Feng family gradually monopolized the local kiln goods sales, controlling the lifeline of the kiln workers. Many merchants from Qizhou, Wuxue, Longping, Xingguo, Ruichang, and other places who came here to buy kiln goods could only place orders with his family. His family collected all the payments in advance from the merchants and then lent them to the kiln workers in small amounts at various cruel high-interest rates. The Hu Feng family pre-contracted all the pottery from a kiln at off-season prices, but did not pay, only allowing the kiln workers to borrow money. The kiln workers had to borrow grain from his family to eat during the production process, with one shi of grain priced as two shi of grain, only listening to increases and not decreases, which was deducted from the kiln goods payments. Kiln workers also needed firewood, oil, salt, and other necessities for production and life, so they had to borrow money from his family again, with a monthly interest rate of 12%, compounding interest, "donkey rolling," regardless of when the kiln workers delivered the goods and repaid their debts, his family always settled accounts at the end of December every year, with astonishing exploitation. Each kiln had to deliver the goods in full at the specified time. If it was late or the pottery was damaged, the kiln workers had to compensate for the "loss" and be beaten, saying they lost his family's "credit." In this way, more than ninety households of the upper, middle, and lower kilns, nearly three hundred people, became slaves of the Hu Feng family in reality. The kiln workers were so poor that they were called "kiln beggars." The actual income of the kiln workers did not match the cost of their hard work, and it was difficult to maintain the lives of their families. At the end of the year, they had to borrow New Year's rice from the Hu Feng family. The Hu Feng family was bustling, with people coming and going, repaying debts and borrowing money.
    This was the main "way to make money" for the Hu Feng family, a bloody path of exploitation. The Hu Feng family's "prosperity" mainly "benefited" from his eldest brother, Zhang Mingshan. No wonder Hu Feng praised his eldest brother so much. The local peasants were very angry when they heard that Hu Feng called Zhang Mingshan a person with "extraordinary virtues." They said angrily: "Nonsense! Extraordinary exploitation counts as one." Isn't it obvious that Hu Feng completely stood on the side of opposition to the peasants?
    The Hu Feng family drank their fill of the peasants' blood and sweat and quickly "prospered," even surpassing the wealthy squire and landlord Zhang Bokai family that his family had originally relied on, and proclaimed himself the "clan chief" of the Zhang clan, occupying the clan's public land and forcibly managing the clan's public lake. According to Zhang clan peasants, more than two-thirds of the income from the clan's public fishing lake fell into the Hu Feng family's hands, and no one dared to say no.
    In the early stages of the Hu Feng family's "prosperity," they had opened workshops for oil noodles, tofu, and rice wine. This is probably what Hu Feng referred to as "small handicraft merchants" (see Hu Feng: "Ode to Glory"). Let's also take a look at what kind of "small handicraft merchant" his family was! Oil noodles, tofu, and rice wine were all sold to kiln workers on credit, converted into cash at high prices, and then converted into kiln goods at low prices, which the kiln workers used to repay their debts. His family used to make and sell rice cakes and flour cakes. Regardless of whether the kiln workers could afford them or needed them, each kiln worker had to buy five every day, and his family recorded the accounts. When the abacus sounded the next year, he calculated the accounts, and a lot of kiln goods were gone again. It can be said that the Hu Feng family's exploitation of peasants and kiln workers was all-pervasive.
    Hu Feng had the closest relationship with his bully landlord brother, Zhang Mingshan. In the preface of "Days of Countercurrent," he said: "My eldest brother" was "the first person to give me deep love, understanding, and trust, enabling me to live according to what I believed in."
    In the "Postscript" of that book, he also said: "I cannot write out how deeply he loved me and how much sacrifice he made for me." Hu Feng spent many years living the life of a full-fledged rich peasant and landlord family, deeply accepting the "love" of his eldest brother Zhang Mingshan. Hu Feng's father, Zhang Jifa, did not advocate that Hu Feng go out to study and "pursue a career," wanting him to "keep the family business"; but Zhang Mingshan strongly advocated that Hu Feng go out to study. He encouraged Hu Feng, saying: "Gu'er (Hu Feng's nickname), it's not wrong to listen to me. Go out to study. It won't work for our kind of family to only have money and no power." The money Hu Feng used to study outside was the blood and sweat money that his eldest brother cruelly exploited from the peasants and kiln workers. Even when Hu Feng was doing some unspeakable things in Japan, Zhang Mingshan traveled far and wide to Wuxue to remit money to him, as much as more than one hundred silver dollars at a time. So Hu Feng loved his eldest brother so much that he could not describe it in words. His eldest brother found him a way to "live according to what he believed in." Sure enough, Hu Feng did not live up to his eldest brother's "love" and did not violate his eldest brother's bully landlord "virtues" and "education." For more than twenty years, he threw himself into the ranks of the counter-revolutionaries, doing anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary "careers." Even today, he has not forgotten his eldest brother's last words. After the Party and the people exposed his "ghost mask," he still wants to "seek rebirth in endurance" "for the sake of career, for a more distant future." Hu Feng! Don't be delusional. The people will not allow you to "seek rebirth in endurance" so safely and comfortably to strangle the revolutionary cause. The people will resolutely and thoroughly smash your anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary clique.
    In February 1947, Zhang Mingshan, Hu Feng's eldest brother, was killed due to a dispute with the Fang clan in his hometown over the "Zhamendang," a public lake rich in fish, belonging to six districts in Qichun and Guangji counties. When the news reached Shanghai, it could not but make Hu Feng greatly "grieved." According to Hu Feng himself, he "felt a grief that even the words 'grief' could not express." Although Zhang Mingshan died in a sectarian feud within the landlord class over the struggle for power, it is worth noting that the slogan used by the Fang clan landlord bully to mobilize the peasants was "Kill Zhang Mingshan for revenge," "Those who have been beaten by Zhang Mingshan go for revenge." Because many Fang clan peasants were slaves of the Zhang Mingshan family—tenants and kiln workers—they had all been cruelly exploited and beaten by Zhang Mingshan. The fact that the peasants and kiln workers were used by the Fang clan landlord bully and involved in sectarian struggles also reflected the contradictions and hatred between the peasants and the landlord class. Standing from the landlord class's perspective, Hu Feng even slandered all the peasants who participated in this feud as "hooligans" (see Hu Feng: "'Days of Countercurrent' Postscript") and "thugs" (see Hu Feng's letter to Fang Juehui, director of the Kuomintang Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters in 1947).
    Hu Feng even lied, disregarding the facts, saying: "The hooligans...took my eldest brother's life with a knife. After killing him, they dragged his bleeding corpse away, dragging it for a mile or two. Only after the surrounding villagers begged bitterly did they leave and walk away. After the corpse was carried back, more than a thousand people who watched were all weeping and calling out to heaven." This is an out-and-out lie, fabricated to praise his bully landlord brother. According to peasants who witnessed the event, were there people who "begged bitterly" when Zhang Mingshan's corpse was dragged away? Yes, there were only three people: Zhang Mingshan's two wives and his third aunt. They did beg bitterly and knelt down to beg. There were also onlookers, but very few. I met many peasants who were in the village at the time. They said: Even if all the surrounding peasants were called, there would not be a thousand people. Peasants Zhang Zhengguang and Zhang Kesheng did not go to see because they were only a short distance away from the scene. Peasant Fei Yinbao did not go to see because he was two miles away. Even those who went to see mostly had a happy feeling and were not "all weeping and calling out to heaven." After Zhang Mingshan was killed, many peasants said: "One big harm is gone." Some old people also said: "Zhang Mingshan did too many evil deeds and deserved to die." What is Hu Feng's position? Yu Dongsheng, the current secretary of the CCP Shaolong Township Branch, said very correctly: "What Hu Feng loves is exactly what we hate." The actual situation of Hu Feng's "attitude of love and hate towards the enemy, friend, and ourselves" is like this.
    After Zhang Mingshan was killed, Hu Feng wrote a letter to his nephew, teaching him how to file a lawsuit; at the same time, he traveled around Shanghai, looking for backers everywhere; and sent telegrams or letters to Wuhan like snowflakes, asking several pseudo-newspapers in Wuhan to publish the news of the "Qichun major blood case" and asking those newspapers to publish editorials to mobilize social opinion. He also wrote letters to Fang Juehui, director of the Kuomintang Provincial Party Headquarters, again and again, asking him to "support" and "uphold justice." The Fang clan that killed Zhang Mingshan was originally Fang Juehui's clan. However, Fang Juehui agreed to Hu Feng's request. Fang Juehui handed over several leaders of the feud who were hiding with him, and they were later sentenced. Here, we can easily see how deep and close the relationship between Hu Feng and the heinous counter-revolutionary bandit leader Fang Juehui was.
    Zhang Mingshan's coffin has not been buried to this day. Hu Feng had generously promised to be responsible for the burial, probably preparing for a grand burial so that he could personally "present" his book "Days of Countercurrent" "to him (Zhang Mingshan), as a bouquet of wildflowers or a handful of pine branches placed in front of his spiritual tablet" ("Days of Countercurrent" Postscript), as a sad sacrifice to the dead counter-revolutionary class and regime! It is fitting that Hu Feng used his dirty book to commemorate his dirty brother.
    From the winter of 1950 to the spring of 1952, the peasants of Qichun County, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, carried out a vigorous struggle to reform the land system. This further aroused Hu Feng's deep hatred for the Party and the people, and also aroused his "grief" for his dying landlord class family. He wrote a letter to one of his former classmates who was working in the current People's Government, questioning him sternly, saying that you are now "officials," why don't you talk about "policy" for my family.
    Who doesn't talk about policy? Hu Feng. Because he hates the Party and the people, he also hates the land system reform policy supported by the people of the whole country, which fundamentally shook his class interests.
    In the spring of 1952, Xishitan Township, Qichun County, was carrying out a land reform review campaign. Hu Feng instructed his landlord second brother, Zhang Mingti, to "apply" to the peasant association, saying that he (Zhang Mingti) had always been diligent, started farming from scratch, and had never exploited anyone, asking the peasant association to re-examine his class status. What kind of person was Zhang Mingti? He was a full-fledged landlord who did not work himself, hired long-term laborers, rented out land, and lent money at high interest rates, and was a cunning landlord known to the local peasants as "careful and meticulous, with a kind face and a vicious heart."
      In a letter written to his fourth brother, Zhang Xueren, on March 2, 1951, Hu Feng called the reasonable and legal liquidation of landlords by peasants according to national policy "making things difficult" for his family. Hu Feng's letter emboldened Zhang Xueren. This counter-revolutionary element, who had served as a pseudo-lianbao director, killed peasants, raped countless women, and seized other people's wives, dared to openly resist the peasant association's liquidation, calling the peasants' economic liquidation of him "asking him for rice."
    Hu Feng never forgot his love and concern for his landlord family. After the land reform, Hu Feng also sent money and clothes to his landlord family several times. On February 5, 1952, Hu Feng's wife, Mei Zhi, wrote a letter to his family using the stationery of the Shanghai "Liberation Daily," saying: "...Today I am sending you a package of old clothes,...The clothes are old, but at this time, you can barely wear them." With a strong hatred for "this time" and a "benevolent heart" for the landlord class, in 1952, when his landlord second brother, Zhang Mingti, who was being controlled by the people, was 60 years old, Hu Feng specially bought several new clothes and sent them, with the words "I wish my second brother a happy birthday with these new clothes" written on the bright red strip.
    The criminal facts of Hu Feng and the counter-revolutionary clique headed by him have been largely exposed. The people of the whole country have recognized that they are their mortal enemies, and the peasants have also begun to recognize that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is the mortal enemy of the peasants. The peasants in Shaolong and Xishitan townships in Qichun County used to regard Hu Feng as a "revolutionary writer" and a "progressive person" because his family had shamelessly touted him. Now they have seen through Hu Feng's true face. Everyone I met asked me to convey their angry demands: Thoroughly investigate all the criminal facts of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique and severely punish them according to law!

    从胡风对地主家庭的态度看他一贯的反革命立场
    胡风原名张光人，又叫张光莹。他的家庭是个反革命的地主家庭，住在湖北省蕲春县第二区邵垅乡和下石潭乡（解放前的地名是菩堤坝区大径桥乡）。胡风兄弟四房，共有田一百五十多亩，其中三十多亩雇长工耕种，一百二十五亩出租，年收租课谷二百五十多石。
    最近，由于工作的方便，我在蕲春县碰到许多熟知胡风家庭情况的人。当我把胡风家庭的真实情况和胡风对他的家庭及其成员的歌颂、赞美、同情、支持、包庇的事实对照以后，我更明白了，原来胡风从来就是站在地主阶级立场上反对农民解放的。我对他家庭情况知道得越多，我越无法抑制自己对这个人民敌人的愤怒。
    胡风在他那本臭名昭著的“逆流的日子”的首页和“后记”中，称颂他的大哥张名山是具有“爱、劳动、自我牺牲、仰慕善良行为的德性”的人，又说“……我底大哥……旧社会给了他怎样大的痛苦，他凭着旧社会给他的一些超人的德性怎样地忍受了以至克服了那些大的痛苦”。当一九四七年张名山被人杀死以后，胡风急忙给武汉各伪报纸写稿为他大哥“申冤”，说张名山“其人寒苦出身，……为人急公好义，在乡民中甚得众望”（录自胡风当时为伪报纸所写稿件的底稿）。胡风用了几乎一切最美好的字眼来歌颂了他的大哥，还说“我不能写出”他的“超人的德性”来。
    究竟胡风为什么“不能写出”他大哥的那种“超人的德性”来呢？
    原来这个胡风称之为“在乡民中甚得众望”的张名山，是个罪大恶极的恶霸地主，当地农民叫他是“五毒”，“恒丰堤内一霸”。一个曾经挨过张名山毒打的农民，邵垅乡五十二岁的贫农毕海元谈到张名山的为人时说：“他家（指张名山家）有钱有势，仗势欺人。张名山心毒嘴狠，能说会道，打官司数他第一。平时对农民和窑民是恶言大语，开口就骂，动手就打。”一九四○年，毕海元在荒地上做了一栋简陋的小屋，张名山硬说这地是他家的，强索地租，还要办酒请他。毕海元虽然出了每年五块银洋的地租，但是没有办酒，结果做起来了的房子被张名山打垮两次，本人也被毒打，毕海元不得不忍气吞声办酒了事。贫农张伯胜因一时还不清张名山的债，全家赖以维持生活的渔船就被强抢了去。在张名山家做活的长工是只能多做，不能多吃，做活要勤，吃饭要快。对佃户，租课谷是丝厘分毫不能少，还得送课鹅课蛋、糯谷良米。张名山在五十多岁的时候还仗势奸污了一个贫农的妻子，后来并据为己有。这些材料当然远不足以说明胡风大哥的那种“超人的德性”，只不过是二三事例而已。
      再让我们看看胡风所吹嘘的他的大哥是怎样凭着“劳动”和“自我牺牲”从“寒苦”中出身，并使得整个的胡风的家庭“发达”起来的吧！“民国”初年，青年的张名山，凭着他那一张能说会道的嘴和一颗势利逢迎的心，巴结上了本族豪绅地主张伯楷家，当时就成了他家极得信任的狗腿帮凶。张名山忠实而凶恶地帮张伯楷家收租，许多收来的租谷就放在他家，张名山就将这些租谷以高利挪借给周围农户和窑民；他又无利或低利从张伯楷家借来粮食和钱转借给农户和窑民，进行高利盘剥。当时胡风家中就已实际成了“二地主”和“二债主”。这是胡风家庭得以“发达”的第一批资本，当然不是什么从“劳动”中来的。
    胡风家庭有了这批资本，以后就开起窑货行来了。恒丰堤内，湖多田窄，当地人民很多是以烧窑做陶器为生，胡风家逐渐地垄断了当地的窑货销售，控制了窑民的生活命脉。蕲州、武穴、龙坪、兴国、瑞昌等地来此办窑货的许多客家，都只能在他家订货。他家从客家那里，预先收了全部货款，然后一点一滴地以各种残酷的方式高利借贷给窑民。胡风家按照淡季价格，将一窑陶器全部预先包下，但并不付款，只是允许窑民借贷，窑民在生产过程中要吃饭，就不得不在他家借粮，一石谷按两石谷折价，听涨不听跌，在窑货款中扣除。窑民还需要烧窑的木柴和油盐等生产、生活必需品，这就不得不又向他家借钱，月利百分之十二，利上翻利，
  “驴子打滚”，不论窑民何时交货偿债，他家总是要在每年腊月底结帐，剥削惊人。每窑必须按照规定的时候如数交清，迟了或者是陶器烧坏了，窑民赔偿“损失”不算，还要挨打，说是失了他家的
  “信用”。这样，那里上、中、下三窑九十多户窑民，将近三百人就实际成了胡风家的奴隶。窑民们穷得被称为“窑花子”。窑民们的实际收入不符血汗成本，难维持一家老小生活，每到年终岁末还不得不到胡风家去借年饭米。而胡风家中却门庭若市，进的进出的出，还的还借的借。
    这就是胡风家庭的主要的“生财之道”，是一条血腥剥削的道路。胡风家庭的“发达”，主要“得力”于他的大哥张名山，难怪胡风那样地称颂他的大哥了。当地农民听说胡风把张名山叫做具有“超人的德性”的人，他们十分气愤地说：“鬼话！超人的剥削倒算得一个。”这不是很明显了么，胡风完全站在同农民敌对的立场。
    胡风的家庭喝饱了农民的血汗，迅速“发达”起来了，甚至超过了他家原来所依靠的豪绅地主张伯楷家，自命为张姓的“族长”，霸占本族的公田，强管本族的公湖。据张姓农民谈，本族公共渔湖的收入有三分之二以上落在胡风家庭中了，谁也不敢说一声不是。
    胡风家庭“发达”的初期，曾经开过油面、豆腐、米酒等作坊。这大概就是胡风所说的“小手艺商人”（见胡风：“光荣赞”）了。我们也来看看他家是怎样一个“小手艺商人”吧！油面、豆腐、米酒等都是赊给窑民的，高价折钱，又按低价折成窑货，窑民用窑货来偿还。他家曾经做过米粑和面粑出卖，不管窑民吃不吃得起和需不需要，每个做窑的人每天必须买五个，他家记下帐来，下年算盘一响，帐由他算，窑货又去了许多。胡风的家庭对农民和窑民的剥削可以说是无孔不入了。
    胡风同他的恶霸地主大哥张名山是有着最亲密的关系的。他在“逆流的日子”的首页中说：“我底大哥”是“第一个把深沉的挚爱、理解、信任给了我，使我有力量依着自己的所信生活了过来的人”。
    在那本书的“后记”中又说：“我不能写出他对我抱着怎样深的挚爱，为我付出了怎样大的牺牲”。胡风在家庭中过了好多年十足的富农、地主家庭的生活，深深地接受了他大哥张名山的“爱”。胡风的父亲张济发是不主张胡风出外读书“做事业”的，要他在家里“守业”；而张名山却极力主张胡风出外读书。他勉励胡风说：“谷儿（胡风的小名），听我的话没有错，出外去读书，我们这种人家光有钱没有势不行。”胡风在外读书所用的钱，就是他大哥从农民和窑民身上残酷剥削得来的血汗钱，甚至胡风在日本干着一些不可告人的勾当的时候，张名山还远涉江湖到武穴为他汇钱，一次就是一百多块银洋。所以胡风是那样言语不能形容地爱他的大哥了，他大哥给他找出了一条“依着自己的所信生活了过来”的道路。果然，胡风没有辜负他大哥的一番“挚爱”，没有违背他大哥的恶霸地主的“德性”和“教育”，他二十多年来投身反革命的队伍中，做着反党反人民反革命的“事业”。直到今天，他还没有忘记他大哥的遗言，在党和人民揭穿了他的
  “鬼画皮”以后，他还要“为了事业，为了更远大的未来”，“在忍受中求得重生”。胡风！不要痴心妄想了，人民不会容许你那样安然自在的“在忍受中求得重生”，好来绞杀革命事业。人民要坚决彻底地粉碎你这个反党反人民反革命的集团。
    一九四七年二月间，胡风的大哥张名山因为强占属于蕲（春）广（济）两县六个区，盛产鱼类的公湖“闸门挡”，同本乡方姓宗族发生纠纷，被杀死。消息传到上海，这就不能不使胡风大为“悲恸”，甚至按照胡风自己的说法，他“所感到的悲恸甚至不是‘悲恸’两个字所能够表示的”。虽然张名山是死于地主阶级内部争权夺利的宗派械斗中，但值得注意的是：方姓地主恶霸作为调动农民的口号是“杀张名山报仇”，“挨张名山打的人去报仇”。因为有不少方姓农民是张名山家的奴隶——佃户和窑民，他们都曾受到张名山的残酷的剥削和毒打，农民和窑民之所以为方姓地主恶霸利用，卷入宗派斗争，也反映了农民同地主阶级的矛盾和仇恨。胡风从地主阶级的立场出发，竟把参加这次械斗的农民也统统污蔑为“恶棍”（见胡风：
  “‘逆流的日子’后记”）和“暴徒”（见胡风于一九四七年给国民党湖北省党部主任委员方觉慧的信）。
    胡风甚至不顾事实地撒谎说：“恶棍们……一刀取去了大哥底生命，杀死以后把流着血的尸首拖走，拖了一两里路，经周围的村民苦苦哀求才丢下走掉，尸首抬回以后，围观的千人以上，无不流泪叫天不已”。这是彻头彻尾的鬼话，是为了颂扬他那个恶霸地主大哥而编造出来的。据亲眼目睹这一事件的农民说，当时张名山尸首被拖走的时候有没有人“苦苦哀求”呢？有，只有三个人：张名山的大小两个老婆和他的三婶娘，他们确实苦苦哀求了，并且跪下来哀求了。也有围观的人，但是很少。我碰到许多当时在乡的农民，他们说：就把周围的农民都叫去，也没有一千人。农民张正光、张克生只隔出事地点里把路没有去看，农民费银宝隔两里路没有去看。就是去看了的人绝大部分也都抱着庆幸的心情，根本不是“无不流泪叫天不已”。张名山被杀后许多农民说：“少了一个大害”，一些老人也说：“张名山作孽太多，死得应该。”胡风的立场是什么？现在的中共邵垅乡支部书记余冬生说得十分对：“胡风所爱的，正是我们所恨的。”胡风“对于敌、友、我的爱爱仇仇的态度”的实际情况就是这样。
    张名山被杀死以后，胡风一面写信给他的侄儿教他如何打官司；一面自己在上海多方奔走，到处找后台；又雪片一样地拍电报或写信到武汉，要武汉几家伪报纸刊登“蕲春一大血案”的消息，并要那些报纸发社论，以动员社会舆论。他并且一而再地给国民党省党部主任委员方觉慧写信，要他
  “支持”，“主持正义”。杀张名山的方姓宗族，原是方觉慧的本族，然而方觉慧竟答应了胡风的要求，方觉慧把正躲避在他那里的几个姓方的械斗的主使人交出来了，后来并判了刑。这里我们不难看出，胡风同罪大恶极的反革命匪首方觉慧有多么深厚亲密的关系。
    张名山的棺材至今没有掩埋。胡风曾慨然承诺由他负责来葬，大概是准备盛葬一番，好亲自把他那本“逆流的日子”“呈献给他（张名山），当作插在他底灵位前面的一束野花或一把松枝”（“逆流的日子”后记），作为对死亡了的反革命阶级和政权的一次哀伤的祭祀吧！胡风用他那本肮脏的书来纪念他那肮脏的大哥，倒也恰如其份。
    一九五○年冬到一九五二年春，蕲春县农民在中国共产党领导下进行了轰轰烈烈的改革土地制度的斗争。这就更激起了胡风对党和人民的深仇大恨，也引起了对他那个即将死亡的地主阶级家庭的
  “悲恸”。他给现在人民政府工作的，他年青时候的一位同学写信，声色俱厉地质问说，你们现在当
  “官”了，为什么对我家里不讲“政策”。
    谁不讲政策呢？胡风。因为他仇视党和人民，他也仇视全国人民拥护的改革土地制度的政策，这个政策根本动摇了他的阶级利益。
    一九五二年春，蕲春县下石潭乡正在开展土地改革复查运动。胡风指使他的地主二哥张名梯到农会去“申请”，说自己（张名梯）是一向勤劳，种田起家，未曾剥削过人，要农会重新审查阶级成份。张名梯是怎样一个人呢？是一个自家不劳动，雇长工，出租土地，放高利贷的十足的地主，是一个被当地农民称之为“细心细肝，面善心毒”的狡猾的地主。
      一九五一年三月二日，胡风给他的四弟张学仁写的信中，把农民根据国家的政策对地主的合理合法的清算叫做和他家“为难”。胡风的信给张学仁壮了胆，这个当过伪联保主任，杀死过农民，强奸过无数妇女，霸占过人妻的反革命分子竟敢公开抗拒农会的清算，把农民对他的经济清算叫做向他
  “讨米”。
    胡风一刻也没有忘记过对他那地主家庭的爱和关切，在土地改革以后，胡风还数次给他地主家庭寄钱寄衣服去。一九五二年二月五日，胡风的妻子梅志用上海“解放日报”的便笺写信给他家里说：“……今天为你们寄出一包旧衣，……衣服是旧的，不过在这种时候，也能勉强穿穿吧。”胡风抱着对“这种时候”的强烈的仇恨和对地主阶级的
  “仁爱的胸怀”，在一九五二年，他那个正被人民管制着的地主二哥张名梯的六十岁生日时，专门买了几件新衣寄去，大红的条子上写着：“以这几件新衣为二哥祝寿”。
    胡风和以他为首的反革命集团的罪恶事实已经被大量揭发了，全国人民认清了他们是自己的死敌，农民们也开始认清，胡风反革命集团是农民的死敌。蕲春县邵垅、下石潭两乡的农民，过去由于胡风家庭为他无耻地吹嘘，也曾把胡风当成一个“革命作家”，“进步人士”；现在他们看清了胡风的真实面目，我所碰到的每一个人都要我转达他们愤怒的要求：彻底查清胡风和他那个反革命集团的一切罪恶事实，并依法严惩！
