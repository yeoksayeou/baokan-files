    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 1st - According to the Indian Information Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru told reporters in New Delhi on May 31st that his upcoming visit to the Soviet Union and other European countries might help achieve the broad goals of India's foreign policy, namely, easing world tensions. Nehru said he was happy to see some of the activities in the Soviet Union. He would visit with a humble and friendly spirit.
    Referring to the sabotage of the "Kashmir Princess," Nehru said there was no doubt that the time bomb was placed on the plane in Hong Kong. In aviation history, he knew of nothing more appalling than this.
    Regarding China's expulsion of four U.S. Air Force personnel who violated Chinese airspace, Nehru said that this measure would certainly be welcomed, not only in a personal sense, but also in the greater sense of easing world tensions in general.
    Nehru said that Goa belongs to India geographically and in every other respect, and it must inevitably become part of the Indian Federation. The question is how to achieve this. It would be absurd to expect India to tolerate foreign possessions on Indian soil. Nehru stated that the Indian government will continue to seek a solution to the Goa issue through peaceful means and negotiations.

    尼赫鲁总理就访问苏联等问题发表谈话
    新华社新德里一日电　据印度新闻处消息，印度总理尼赫鲁五月三十一日在新德里对记者发表谈话说，他将要进行的对苏联和其他一些欧洲国家的访问，可能有助于实现印度外交政策的广泛目的，那就是和缓世界紧张局势。尼赫鲁说，他很乐意去看看苏联活动的一些情况。他将抱着虚心的和友好的精神前去访问。
    尼赫鲁在谈到“克什米尔公主号”被破坏事件时说，没有疑问，定时炸弹是在香港安放在飞机上的。在航空史上，他不知道任何比这更可怖的事情。
    关于中国把侵犯中国领空的四个美国空军人员驱逐出境的事情，尼赫鲁说，不仅从个人的意义上，而且从缓和世界紧张局势的总的趋势的更大意义上来看，这个措施肯定会受到欢迎。
    尼赫鲁说，从地理上和从其他任何方面来说，果阿都是属于印度的，并且它不可避免地必须成为印度联邦的一部分。问题是如何加以实现。希望印度容忍外国在印度土地上的属地，那是荒谬的。尼赫鲁表示，印度政府将继续通过和平方式和谈判来寻求果阿问题的解决。
