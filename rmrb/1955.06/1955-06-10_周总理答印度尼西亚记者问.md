Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, received Indonesian Antara News Agency reporter Sunarjo, "Indonesian Torch" reporter Sulaiman, "Social Envoy" reporter Asa Bafagih, "Eastern Star" reporter Kruwet, and "Indonesian News" reporter Dasin Suratdi on the evening of June 2nd. The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's answers to questions from Indonesian journalists is as follows:

    Q: Since Article 4 of the joint statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Ali Sastroamidjojo in Jakarta mentions that the two countries support each other in safeguarding their respective territorial integrity, we hope that, according to Your Excellency's opinion, the true meaning of this article can be explained.

    A: The people of both China and Indonesia have suffered from colonialism for a long time; the people of both countries have only recently gained their national independence and are still fighting to safeguard their respective sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chinese people are fighting to liberate their territory of Taiwan; the Indonesian people are also working to recover West Irian. This common experience and encounter naturally makes the people of our two countries sympathize with and care for each other. The joint statement issued by the Premiers of China and Indonesia on April 28, 1955, expressing deep sympathy and support for the efforts of either of the two countries to safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity, expresses this mutual feeling between the people of the two countries and is in line with the agreements of the Asian-African Conference.

    What the Premiers of the two countries expressed in Article 4 of the joint statement is clearly mutual political and moral support, and does not imply that the two countries support each other with military force. China's exercise of its sovereignty over Taiwan is purely an internal affair. If foreign armed forces participate in and interfere in this issue, it will cause international conflicts, which is precisely what we have always opposed.

    Q: In various statements during this period, Your Excellency has stated that the People's Republic of China is prepared to resolve existing disputes peacefully. Does this also mean that the Taiwan issue, which the People's Republic of China regards as an internal affair, can also be resolved peacefully?

    In resolving world tensions, regarding the Taiwan issue, the People's Republic of China has expressed its willingness to negotiate peacefully with the United States. Does this also mean that the People's Republic of China can accept a ceasefire condition to begin resolving the aforementioned tensions?

    A: The People's Republic of China has always advocated resolving international disputes by peaceful means. At the Asian-African Conference, China, together with other participating countries, reiterated this position.

    Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair. The United States' occupation of Taiwan has created tension in the Taiwan region, which is an international issue between China and the United States. These two issues cannot be confused. Based on its consistent position of peacefully resolving international disputes, China has made it clear that the Chinese government is willing to sit down with the United States government for negotiations to ease and eliminate tensions in the Taiwan region. China welcomes countries that are concerned about the situation in this region, especially countries friendly to China, to mediate to facilitate the realization of this negotiation. However, there is no war between China and the United States, so there is no such thing as a ceasefire, let alone using it as a precondition for negotiation. As for the way the Chinese people liberate Taiwan, I have pointed out that the Chinese people are willing, under possible conditions, to strive to liberate Taiwan peacefully.

    Q: In view of the signing of the treaty on resolving the issue of dual nationality, and Article 3 of the joint statement by Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Ali Sastroamidjojo reiterating the above issue, we would like to ask Your Excellency, what specific efforts can be made in accordance with the content and spirit of Article 3 of the joint statement?

    A: The treaty on the issue of dual nationality signed between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia has resolved a difficult issue left over from history between our two countries. This treaty is an important symbol of the further development of friendly cooperative relations between our two countries, and has therefore been warmly welcomed by the people of both countries. In order to ensure the thorough implementation of this treaty, the governments of the two countries have agreed on specific measures conducive to the implementation of the treaty. We believe that after this treaty is ratified by both countries, it will be conducive to the friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence of our two countries, and will lead to China resolving the issue of dual nationality with other relevant countries.

    Q: To what extent can the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia promote economic cooperation in the short term, especially mutual assistance in trade and finance?

    A: Long-term colonial rule and plunder have left both of our countries in a backward state. Now, both of our countries need to eliminate this backward state through industrialization based on the development of heavy industry. Both of our countries are rich in resources and have the potential for economic development. In order to help each other's economic development, our two countries can exchange raw materials and products, and complement each other's strengths in production technology and experience. This makes the economic cooperation between our two countries possible and has broad prospects.

    Economic cooperation between our two countries has actually already begun. In 1953, our two countries signed a trade agreement, and last year we signed a payment agreement and a trade protocol. Now our two countries are discussing the issue of further developing economic cooperation.

    The basis for economic cooperation between our two countries is equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty. In economic exchanges with backward countries, colonial countries always seek various privileges, making backward countries even more stagnant and impoverished, and forever becoming raw material production bases, investment sites, and monopoly markets for colonial countries. However, in the economic cooperation between our two countries, we do not demand privileges from each other. Our purpose is to promote each other's industrialization based on mutual assistance and the development of our respective production. We believe that this principle also applies to economic cooperation among Asian countries. Asian countries need to develop their own productive forces, improve the living standards of their people, meet the needs of the growing population, and consolidate their national defense and guarantee national independence through mutual assistance and the promotion of their respective industrialization. Therefore, this economic cooperation between our two countries not only conforms to the interests of the people of our two countries, but is also conducive to peace in Asia and the world.

    周总理答印度尼西亚记者问
    新华社十日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来在六月二日晚接见了印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社记者苏纳约，“印度尼西亚火炬报”记者苏莱曼，“社会使者报”记者阿萨·巴法吉，“东星报”记者克鲁韦特，“印度尼西亚新闻”记者达新·苏拉地。周恩来总理答印度尼西亚记者问的全文如下：
    问：由于周恩来总理和阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理在雅加达发表的联合声明的第四条中提到两国相互支持以维护各自的领土完整，我们希望根据阁下的意见，就这一条的真正意义予以说明。
    答：中国和印度尼西亚两国人民都曾经长期遭受殖民主义的苦难；两国人民都只是在最近才获得自己国家的独立，而且都还在为维护各自主权和领土完整而奋斗。中国人民正在为解放自己的领土台湾而斗争；印度尼西亚人民也正在为收复西伊里安而努力。这种共同的经历和遭遇就很自然地使得我们两国人民互相同情和关怀。中国和印度尼西亚两国总理在一九五五年四月二十八日的联合声明中表示深切地同情和支持两国中任何一国维护自己主权和领土完整的努力，就是表达了两国人民的这种互相的感情，同时也是符合于亚非会议的协议的。
    两国总理在联合声明的第四条中所表示的，显然是政治上和道义上的互相支持，而没有两国以武力互相支持的含意。中国对台湾行使自己的主权纯粹是内政问题。在这个问题上，如果有外国武装力量的参加和干涉，就会引起国际冲突，这正是我们历来所反对的。
    问：这一时期阁下在各项声明中曾声称中华人民共和国方面准备以和平方式解决存在着的纠纷，这是否也意味着被中华人民共和国看作内政问题的台湾问题也可用和平方式解决？
    在解决世界紧张局势中，关于台湾问题，中华人民共和国方面已表示准备以和平方式同美国谈判，这是否也意味着中华人民共和国能够接受停火条件来开始解决上述紧张局势的事宜？
    答：中华人民共和国一向主张以和平方式解决国际争端。在亚非会议中，中国同其他与会国家一起，又曾经重申这一主张。
    台湾是中国的领土，中国人民解放台湾是中国的内政问题。美国侵占台湾造成了台湾地区的紧张局势，这是中美之间的国际问题。这两个问题不能混为一谈。本着和平解决国际争端的一贯立场，中国方面已经明确提出，中国政府愿意同美国政府坐下来谈判，以和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势。中国欢迎关心这一地区局势的国家，特别是对中国友好的国家，为促使这一谈判实现而进行的斡旋。但是中美之间并没有战争，因此不发生所谓停火问题，更不能以此作为谈判的先决条件。至于中国人民解放台湾的方式，我已经指出过，中国人民愿意在可能的条件下，争取用和平的方式解放台湾。
    问：鉴于解决双重国籍问题条约的签订，而周恩来总理和阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理的联合声明中第三条对上述问题又重新予以声明，因此我们想请问阁下，按照联合声明中第三条的内容和精神，能够进行些什么具体的努力？
    答：中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国签订的关于双重国籍问题的条约，解决了我们两国之间一个从历史上遗留下来的困难问题。这个条约是我们两国友好合作关系进一步发展的重要标志，因此受到了两国人民的热烈欢迎。为了保证这个条约的彻底实施，两国政府已经商定了有利于条约实施的具体办法。我们相信，这个条约在得到两国批准后，将会有利于我们两国的友好合作和和平共处，并将会导致中国同其他的有关国家解决双重国籍问题。
    问：中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国在短期内促进经济合作事宜，特别是在贸易和财政方面的互相援助，将能够做到何种地步？
    答：长期的殖民主义的统治和掠夺使我们两国都处于落后的状态。现在我们两国都需要通过以发展重工业为基础的工业化来消除这种落后状态。我们两国都是资源丰富的国家，也都具有经济发展的潜力。为了互相帮助经济发展，我们两国在原料和产品方面可以互通有无，在生产的技术和经验方面可以互补短长。这就使我们两国的经济合作有发展的可能和广阔的前途。
    我们两国之间的经济合作实际上已经开始。一九五三年我们两国签订了贸易协定，去年又签订了支付协定和贸易议定书。现在我们两国正在对进一步发展经济合作的问题进行商讨。
    我们两国进行经济合作的基础是平等互利和互相尊重国家主权。殖民主义国家在同落后国家的经济往来中总是要取得各种特权，使落后国家更加处于停滞和贫困的状态，永远成为殖民国家的原料产地、投资场所和垄断市场。但是在我们两国的经济合作中，我们彼此不要求特权，我们的目的是以互相帮助、各自发展生产为基础来促进彼此的工业化。我们相信这一原则同样适用于亚洲各国间的经济合作。亚洲各国都需要经过互相帮助、促进各自工业化的道路，才能发展自己的生产力，提高人民的生活水平，满足逐年增加的人口的需要，也才能巩固国防，保障国家的独立。因此，我们两国的这种经济合作不仅符合于我们两国人民的利益，而且也有利于亚洲和世界的和平。
