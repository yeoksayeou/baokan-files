Xinhua News Agency, June 28th. Chairman Ho Chi Minh and members of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, including Le Van Hien, Phan Anh, Nguyen Van Huyen, Nghiem Xuan Yem, Ung Van Khiem, and Pham Ngoc Thach, visited the state-owned Beijing Southern Suburb Farm on the morning of the 28th.

Accompanying Chairman Ho Chi Minh were Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and Director of the Protocol Department Ke Hua.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh was warmly welcomed by the farm's staff. The farm's director, Guo Ziqing, provided the distinguished guests with a detailed introduction to the farm. This farm, which focuses on animal husbandry, combines agriculture and animal husbandry, and appropriately develops horticulture, has a land area of 23,000 mu. This area was once an ammunition depot built by Japanese imperialism when they invaded China and a desolate wilderness. The farm was established in 1949. Chairman Ho Chi Minh raised many questions about the farm's land use and management, livestock breeding, and the living conditions of the workers, all of which were answered in detail by Guo Ziqing.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh and others went to the machinery yard and visited the farm's more than 30 types of agricultural machinery. The farm's deputy director, Li Zhenrong, introduced these machines to the distinguished guests one by one. Li Zhenrong worked as a female tractor driver for six years and was promoted to deputy director in 1952.

At the cattle farm and pig farm, the distinguished guests were particularly interested in seeing the well-bred, high-quality fat pigs raised here, the largest of which weighed more than 800 jin. The farm raises a total of 928 cattle and more than 1,300 pigs.

Finally, Chairman Ho Chi Minh and others traveled eight li by car to one of the farm's work stations. Braving the scorching sun, they watched the combined harvester harvesting wheat. Guo Ziqing told Chairman Ho Chi Minh that each combined harvester can harvest 200 mu of wheat per day.

Upon leaving the farm, Chairman Ho Chi Minh wished the farm greater achievements.

    胡志明主席受到农场工作人员的热情欢迎。农场场长郭子清向贵宾们详细地介绍了农场的情况。这个以畜牧为主、农牧结合并适当发展园艺的农场，拥有土地面积达二万三千亩。这里过去是日本帝国主义侵略中国时修造的一所弹药库和一片荒芜的原野，一九四九年创办了农场。胡志明主席对农场土地的利用和管理、家畜的养育和职工生活情况提出了许多问题，都得到郭子清详尽的解答。
    胡志明主席等到机械场，参观了农场的三十多种农业机器，农场副场长李振荣把这些机器一一向贵宾们作了介绍。李振荣曾作了六年女拖拉机手，一九五二年被提拔为副场长。
    在养牛场和养猪场，贵宾们特别有兴趣地看到了这里饲养的品种优良的肥猪，其中最大的有八百多斤重。这个农场共饲养九百二十八头牛，一千三百多只猪。
    最后，胡志明主席等乘车走了八里的路程来到了农场的一个作业站。他们冒着炽热的太阳，参观了联合收割机收割小麦的情形。郭子清告诉胡志明主席，每架联合收割机一天能收割二百亩小麦。
    在离开农场时，胡志明主席祝农场获得更大的成就。
