    Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Scrap Steel Recycling Work Is Not Thorough
    By our reporter Chang Gong
    The scrap steel recycling work in Anshan has been underway for more than two months, from mid-March this year to the present, and is still continuing. According to statistics from Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, as of May 15th, the amount of scrap steel recycled has reached 48,889 tons. Among them, there are many usable materials, equipment, and tools, and some have already been used in production and construction.
    Some factories, mines, and engineering companies have paid attention to mobilizing the masses, not only recovering the scrap steel discarded in the past, but also raising the awareness of employees, enabling the masses to consciously recycle the scrap steel generated in their daily production, and establishing certain systems and methods to fundamentally solve the problem of scrap steel recycling. For example, the cast iron team of the second work section of the casting pipe factory used to have a large amount of molten steel splashed on the ground when casting pipes, and each time it was swept away and thrown away with the garbage. Now, the employees use sieves to sift the garbage every day, and can sift out 690 kilograms of scrap iron a day, even tiny scraps of iron the size of rice grains are collected.
    However, not all production factories, mines, and engineering companies are like this. On the contrary, there are still many units that have not paid attention to this work. For example, the leaders of the Iron Smelting Plant put this work in opposition to other work, emphasizing the difficulties. By the end of April, the scrap steel recycling work had not even started. The Mineral Processing Plant and the Metal Structure Manufacturing Plant only acted when urged, and became unhappy when urged too much. The Party Committee Secretary and the Factory Director of the Metal Structure Manufacturing Plant told the Municipal Party Committee inspection team: "The Municipal Party Committee's instructions only asked us to do it roughly, not thoroughly! If you inspect like this, we won't even be able to dump our garbage."
    More seriously, while recycling scrap steel, many units continue to discard large amounts of it. The Steelmaking Plant discarded more than 940 tons of molten steel with slag in April alone. The Timber Section of the Supply Department even used more than 900 train carriages of garbage containing large amounts of scrap steel to fill pits, leveling them with bulldozers. A construction site of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company once buried seven pieces of steel slag weighing 10 to 30 tons, containing 40 percent steel. The Second Mining Engineering Company dismantled the metal structure frames of Dagushan, weighing more than 1,000 tons, and buried most of them underground. Even the Anshan Automobile Brigade, which is not related to iron and steel production, had more than 100 kilograms of scrap steel in a truckload of garbage it hauled out on May 4th, including many spare parts needed for automobiles.
      Why has this intolerable phenomenon occurred even after the scrap steel recycling work has been going on for so long? The main reason is that the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company lack fundamental guidelines and methods to solve this problem. The scrap steel problem in Anshan is a serious problem that has long been prevalent in all factories, mines, and engineering companies in Anshan, but they have not paid attention to this problem for several years. Only after newspapers such as the People's Daily and the Liaoning Daily criticized it did they feel the seriousness of the situation and began to pay attention to the recycling work. However, due to the lack of specific analysis and research on the situation, they thought that the problem could be solved by simply recovering the large amount of scrap steel abandoned in the past. They did not realize that it is impossible to fundamentally solve the problem if they only recover the scrap steel abandoned in the past without solving the problem of recycling the scrap steel generated in production. Precisely because there is a deviation in the leadership's thinking, they have not fully mobilized the masses to participate in this work in their practices, nor have they considered how to raise the awareness of employees through this work to fundamentally solve the problem of scrap steel recycling. They only transferred more than 1,300 employees from various production factories, mines, and engineering companies to form a scrap steel recycling team and established a scrap steel recycling headquarters to specifically recycle the scrap steel abandoned in various places in the past. Of course, when the scrap steel recycling began, it was entirely necessary to organize a certain amount of manpower to recycle the scrap steel abandoned in the past, and in fact, it did achieve considerable results. However, relying solely on the scrap steel recycling team cannot completely solve the problem. In addition, the scrap steel recycling team is not well organized and the coordination with factories, construction sites, and transportation is not close enough, which sometimes causes unnecessary waste of manpower. The employees of the third squad of the second team of the scrap steel recycling team are often idle.
    Of course, the Municipal Party Committee and the Company have held emergency mobilization meetings, issued calls, and organized inspection teams to inspect various units in the scrap steel recycling work. However, since the guiding ideology is biased towards recovering the scrap steel abandoned in the past, and the practice relies solely on the scrap steel recycling team, many production factories, mines, and engineering companies have not fully mobilized the masses to solve the problem fundamentally. The experiences and methods of the well-performing production factories, mines, and engineering companies have not been valued, summarized, and promoted. Therefore, a serious situation has been created in which a large amount of scrap steel is being recycled on the one hand, and a large amount of scrap steel is being discarded on the other hand.
    Recently, the Anshan Municipal Party Committee issued a circular criticizing the units that do not pay attention to this work, pointing out that the scrap steel recycling work must be done thoroughly. The Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and the Manager of the Company also summoned the Party organizations and administrative leaders of some units that have not done a good job in scrap steel recycling to talk to them and ask them to do this work thoroughly. However, based on the above situation, in order to thoroughly solve the scrap steel problem in Anshan, it is first necessary to correct the guiding ideology, summarize the experience already gained, and fully mobilize the masses. Otherwise, the scrap steel problem in Anshan will be difficult to solve thoroughly.

    鞍钢回收废钢铁的工作做得不彻底
    本报记者常工
    鞍山回收废钢铁的工作，从今年三月中旬到现在，已经进行了两个多月，目前还在继续进行中。根据鞍山钢铁公司和鞍山钢铁建设公司的统计，到五月十五日止，回收的废钢铁已达四万八千八百八十九吨。其中有不少是还可使用的器材、设备和工具，有一些已经用到了生产和建设上去。
    有些厂矿和工程公司注意了发动群众，不仅把过去丢弃的废钢铁回收起来，而且提高了职工的觉悟，使群众自觉地回收在每天的生产当中所产生的废钢铁，并建立了一定的制度和办法，从根本上解决了回收废钢铁问题。例如铸管厂二工段的铸铁班，过去铸管时常有大量的钢水溅在地上，每次都和垃圾一块清扫出去扔掉了。现在职工们每天都用筛子来筛垃圾，一天能筛出碎铁六百九十公斤，甚至连米粒那样小的废铁也都收了起来。
    但是，并不是所有的生产厂矿和工程公司都是这样，相反地还有不少的单位一直没有重视这个工作。例如炼铁厂的领导人员把这一工作同其他工作对立起来，强调困难，到四月底，回收废钢铁的工作还一直没有动静。选矿厂和金属结构制造厂都是催一下才动一下，催得多了，还不高兴。金属结构制造厂的党委书记和厂长对市委检查组说：“市委指示只是叫大致搞一下，也没有叫彻底搞呀！像你们这样检查，我们的垃圾都不能倒了。”
    更严重的是，在回收废钢铁的同时，还有不少单位仍然继续大量地丢弃废钢铁。炼钢厂在四月份
  一个月内随渣扔掉的钢水就达九百四十多吨。供应处木材科竟将九百多火车皮藏有大量废钢铁的垃圾填坑，用推土机一推而平。轧钢工程公司某工地一次就埋掉了十吨到三十吨重的含钢百分之四十的钢渣块七块。第二矿山工程公司将大孤山一千多吨重的金属结构架拆下来，大部分都埋在了地下。就连与钢铁生产没有关系的鞍钢汽车大队，在五月四日那天往外拉的一汽车垃圾里也有一百多公斤废钢铁，其中有不少是汽车上需用的零件。
      回收废钢铁工作进行了这么长的时间，为什么还会发生这种不能令人容忍的现象呢？主要的原因是中共鞍山市委员会和鞍山钢铁公司以及鞍山钢铁建设公司领导方面缺乏从根本上解决这个问题的方针和办法。鞍山的废钢铁问题是鞍山所有厂矿和工程公司长期普遍存在的严重问题，但是几年来这个问题却一直没有引起他们的注意。自从人民日报和辽宁日报等报纸批评后，他们才感到严重，开始注意回收工作，但是又由于对情况缺乏具体的分析和研究，以为只要把过去遗弃的大量废钢铁回收起来就可以解决问题，没有认识到光回收过去遗弃的废钢铁，而不解决回收生产当中所产生的废钢铁，是不可能从根本上解决问题的。正因为领导思想上有偏差，所以在作法上也就没有充分发动群众来参加这
  一工作，也没有考虑如何通过这一工作提高职工的觉悟，从根本上来解决回收废钢铁问题。他们只是从各个生产厂矿和工程公司抽调了一千三百多名职工，组成了回收废钢铁大队，成立了回收废钢铁指挥部，专门回收过去遗弃在各处的废钢铁。当然在回收废钢铁开始的时候，组织一定的人力回收过去遗弃的废钢铁，是完全必要的，事实上也的确取得了不少成绩。但是光靠回收废钢铁大队是不能完全解决问题的，加上回收废钢铁大队组织得不好，同厂矿、工地，以及运输方面的配合不够密切，有时反而造成了不必要的人力浪费。回收废钢铁第二大队第三中队的职工们就经常闲着没事干。
    固然，市委和公司在回收废钢铁工作上，曾经召开过紧急动员大会，发出过号召，也组织了检查组到各单位去检查，但是由于指导思想上偏重于回收过去遗弃的废钢铁，在作法上又单纯地依靠回收废钢铁大队，因此许多生产厂矿和工程公司也就没有充分地发动群众从根本上来解决问题。而做得好的生产厂矿和工程公司的经验和办法也没有受到重视、加以总结和推广。因此就造成了一面在大量回收废钢铁，一面在大量丢掉废钢铁的严重情况。
    最近鞍山市委发了一个通报，对于不重视这一工作的单位进行了批评，指出一定要彻底做好回收废钢铁的工作。市委书记和公司经理也曾把一些回收废钢铁工作作得不好的单位的党组织和行政方面的负责人找来谈话，要他们彻底做好这一工作。但是，根据上述情况来看，要想彻底地解决鞍山的废钢铁问题，首先就要端正指导思想，总结已取得的经验，充分发动群众，否则鞍山的废钢铁问题是很难彻底解决的。
