    The Motherland is a Warm Home Everywhere
    ——A Record of Beijing Immigrants Arriving in Yinchuan, Gansu
    Yu Zhuang
    The Yinchuan Special District of Gansu Province is an eight-hundred-li plain bordering the Yellow River to the east and the Helan Mountains to the west. It is a famous land of rice and grain, also known as "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall." Here, crisscrossing canals irrigate millions of mu of farmland, producing large quantities of rice, wheat, and fruit, and the fishery production is also very rich. There are also boundless expanses of barren beach suitable for a large number of immigrants to reclaim. The beautiful Yinchuan inspires the local people to work hard and attracts people from other places to move in and develop it. This year, a large number of immigrants from Beijing, Lanzhou, and other places will arrive in Yinchuan successively. This will not only solve the resettlement problem of urban poor people but also enable the rich Yinchuan to contribute more wealth to the motherland.
    On May 24th, right at the time for planting rice, the first batch of 54 households, 230 people, of Beijing immigrants arrived in Yinchuan. For these people who have lived in Beijing for generations, the beautiful Yinchuan is indeed an unpredictable mystery. However, as the immigrants passed through the vast Inner Mongolian grassland and entered the territory of Yinchuan by car, the fishing boats coming and going on the Yellow River, the willow-lined roads, the beautiful and majestic Helan Mountains, and the boundless green fields… everything broadened their minds. The elderly among the immigrants stroked their beards and smiled: "The name Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall is indeed well-deserved." The children were even more excited, looking around in the car. A housewife, Miao Jiafeng, said to the local people as soon as she got off the bus: "Chairman Mao has settled us in a good place!" Immigrant Zhen Caiqing wrote in his diary: "The motherland is full of beautiful rivers and mountains. I never dreamed that Yinchuan would be such a beautiful place. The government has settled us here, so we must put our heart into production!"
    The first batch of immigrants was settled in Tongji District, Helan County, which is surrounded by mountains and rivers and has 12,000 mu of arable wasteland. The local people's government established an immigrant resettlement committee as early as February this year, planning to build 1,000 houses here, resettle 2,500 immigrants, and establish an immigrant township. Now, 455 houses have been built, and rows of immigrant houses stand neatly in the middle of the river beach. The houses are spacious and practical, with kangs, stoves, and cooking utensils inside, and livestock pens and firewood sheds outside. Before the immigrants arrived, the local farmers arranged everything as if they were arranging their own homes. They said: "We want the immigrants to feel as comfortable as if they have returned to their own homes." Their wishes have been fully realized. When immigrant Liu Tongchun and his wife walked into their new home with their three children, they were filled with unspeakable gratitude. They tightly shook the hands of the local farmers who were helping them move their luggage and said: "When we left Beijing, the staff of the district people's committee told us 'everything is ready there'; however, we did not expect that there would be: kangs in the room, mats on the kangs, charcoal in the stove, water in the tank... We really feel like we have returned to our own homes."
    The local people treated the immigrants like relatives, and after settling each household, they talked to them cordially. The next day, a welcome meeting was held in the immigrant residential area, and nearby farmers, young and old, came to participate. The party and government leaders of the Yinchuan Special District personally visited each household to express their sympathy and solicit opinions on the resettlement work; the accompanying medical personnel also lived near the new homes of the immigrants to provide medical care for them. The immigrant committee set up an office here to supply the immigrants with food, oil, salt, vegetables, etc. Immigrant Liu Tonghai, who used to pull a rickshaw in Beijing, was not very willing to come to Yinchuan when he set off, because his wife was worried that life outside would be very inconvenient, and she was always frowning along the way. But on the second day after arriving in Yinchuan, she smiled and said to people: "The new society is the same everywhere." Chen Xijiu, an old man of sixty-two who immigrated, said at the welcome meeting on behalf of the immigrants: "I have never seen a people's government care for immigrants like this today. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the motherland is a warm home everywhere."
    Production conditions have also been arranged for the immigrants. As early as the spring sowing season, the local government, under the strong support of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, opened a branch canal, reclaimed more than 3,000 mu of wasteland, and sowed 1,800 mu of wheat, beans, and sweet potatoes. The rest of the land is planned to be planted with rice. Most of the large agricultural implements to be purchased, such as 40 large carts, 48 draft animals, 60 new-style walking plows, and 40 double-wheeled double-share plows, have been purchased and will be provided for the collective use of the immigrants. In addition, small agricultural implements such as hoes, spades, and back baskets were provided to each household. When the immigrants saw all this, especially when they saw the green and thriving autumn seedlings that the government and local farmers had planted for them, many people were moved to tears.
    There are two agricultural production cooperatives and four mutual aid teams near Tongji Beach. These organized farmers not only give the immigrants cordial care in their lives, but also give them a lot of help and support in production. Du Yong, the director of the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative, led the members to introduce the local farming techniques to the immigrants, and said that they would use the surplus labor in the cooperative to draw a few skilled producers to help and teach the immigrants to farm. The Immigrant Resettlement Committee has hired five skilled old farmers as technical instructors for immigrant production. The Agricultural Technology Extension Station also sent people to teach the immigrants how to use double-wheeled double-share plows. Three households of immigrants who originally lived in Shijingshan District, Beijing, quickly understood the technology of using double-wheeled double-share plows, and old man Chen Xijiu also enthusiastically learned production techniques from local farmers.
    Now, all the labor force among the immigrants has been put into production, and they have put forward the demand for collective production. Let us look forward to more beautiful flowers blooming on the immigrant beach of the beautiful Yinchuan!

    祖国到处都是温暖的家
    ——记北京移民到达甘肃银川
    育庄
    甘肃省银川专区是东临黄河，西屏贺兰山的八百里平川，是有名的米粮之川，也是有名的“塞上江南”。这儿有纵横交错的渠道，灌溉着数百万亩农田，出产大量的稻米、小麦和水果，渔产也很丰富。这儿还有一望无际的大块荒滩，可供大量移民开垦。美丽的银川，鼓舞着当地人们辛勤地劳动，也吸引着外地的人们移来开发它。今年，北京和兰州等地都将有大量移民陆续来到银川。这不单解决了城市贫民的安置问题，也将使富饶的银川为祖国贡献出更多的财富。
    五月二十四日，正是播稻的时节，北京首批移民五十四户，二百三十人，来到了银川。对这些祖祖辈辈住在北京的人，美丽的银川确实是一个难以猜测的谜。但是当移民们穿过广阔的内蒙古大草原，乘车进入银川境内以后，那往来在黄河水面的渔船，那杨柳夹道的公路，那秀丽巍峨的贺兰山，那一望无际的绿野……一切都使他们心胸更加开阔了。移民中的老年人捋着胡子笑道：“这塞外江南果然名不虚传。”儿童们更是兴致勃勃地在车上到处张望。一个家庭妇女苗家凤一下车就对当地群众说：“毛主席可把我们安置到好地方了！”移民甄材青在日记上写道：“祖国到处是锦绣河山，真梦想不到银川是这样美的地方，政府把我们安置在这里，可得拿起心劲好好生产啊！”
    首批移民被安置在贺兰县通济区，这里依山傍水，拥有一万二千亩可耕的荒滩地。当地人民政府早在今年二月间就成立了移民安置委员会，计划在这里修建一千间房屋，安置两千五百名移民，成立一个移民乡。现在这里已建成四百五十五间房屋，一排排的移民住房，整齐地矗立在河滩地的中间。房子盖得宽敞、适用，屋内有炕、炉灶，并设置了灶具，屋外还有牲畜圈棚、柴炭房。当地农民在移民未到以前，就像安排自己的家一样，把一切安排得妥妥贴贴，他们说：“我们要让移民们像回到自己的家一样的舒适。”他们的这种心愿完全实现了。当移民刘同春夫妇带着三个小孩走进他们的新家时，有说不出的感激。他们紧紧地握住正在帮他们搬行李的当地农民的手说：“我们在北京动身时，区人民委员会的工作人员就告诉我们‘那里一切都准备好了’；可是，我们却没想到这里会是：屋内有炕，炕上有席，炉内有炭，缸里有水……我们真像回到了自己的家。”
    当地群众像接待亲人一般，在安置了每一户移民后，都同他们亲热地攀谈起来。第二天，在移民住宅区召开了欢迎会，附近的农民扶老携幼都来参加。银川专区党、政负责同志亲自来挨门逐户地慰问，征求移民们对安置工作的意见；随来的医疗人员也住在移民新宅附近为移民们看病。移民委员会在这里设了办公室，供给移民吃的粮食、油、盐、蔬菜等。移民刘通海，原来在北京拉三轮车，这次他动身来银川时，他爱人还不太愿意，担心外面生活会很不方便，一路上总是愁眉不展。但是在到达银川的第二天便眉开眼笑地对人们说：“新社会到哪里都一样。”六十二岁的移民老汉陈锡九在欢迎会上代表移民讲话说：“我从没有见过像今天人民政府这样关怀移民。在共产党和毛主席领导下，祖国到处是温暖的家。”
    这里还为移民安排了生产的条件。早在春播季节，当地政府即领导群众在农业生产合作社、互助组的大力支持下，开辟了一道支渠，开垦了三千多亩荒地，并播了一千八百亩的小麦、豆类和山芋，其余的地准备种稻子。计划要购置的四十辆大车、四十八头耕畜、六十部新式步犁、四十部双轮双铧犁等大型农具已大部买到，将供移民集体使用。另外还供给了每户铣、锄、背斗等小型农具。移民们看到了这一切，特别是看到政府和当地农民替他们种的油绿、茁壮的秋苗时，好些人都感动得落下泪来。
    通济滩附近有两个农业生产合作社和四个互助组。这些组织起来的农民不仅对移民在生活上给予亲切的关怀，在生产上也给移民们很多的帮助和支持。光明农业生产合作社社主任杜永，带着社员们给移民介绍了当地的耕作技术，并且表示要利用社内剩余劳动力，抽出几个生产能手，帮助和教给移民种田。移民安置委员会已请了五名熟练老农，作为移民生产的技术指导员。农业技术推广站也派人教给移民双轮双铧犁的使用方法。原住北京石景山区的三户移民，很快就懂得了使用双轮双铧犁的技术，老汉陈锡九也热情洋溢地向当地农民学习生产技术。
    现在，所有移民中的劳力都投入了生产，他们已提出集体生产的要求。让我们期待在那美丽的银川的移民滩上开放出更美丽的花朵吧！
