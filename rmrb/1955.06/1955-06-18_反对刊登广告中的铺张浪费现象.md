It has become "customary" for many newspapers to publish supplements on holidays and to include many advertisements in those supplements. Looking at the newspapers published on International Labor Day this year, twelve out of the fifteen broadsheet dailies published in the eight major cities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Xi'an, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Guangzhou) issued supplements, ranging from two pages to six pages. Including the supplements published by Shanghai's *Liberation Daily* and Beijing's *People's Daily* around May 1st, a total of forty-four pages of supplements were published, with advertisements occupying more than thirty pages. This shows that the purpose of many newspapers in publishing supplements is to include more advertisements. For example, the *Yangtze Daily* in Wuhan published a six-page supplement on May 1st, with five pages of advertisements; the *Tianjin Dagong Daily* published a four-page supplement, all of which were advertisements; the *Shenyang Daily*, *Liaoning Daily*, and *Chongqing Daily* each published four-page supplements, with advertisements occupying three to three and a half pages each.

We are not opposed to publishing advertisements in newspapers, as long as these advertisements are genuinely beneficial to the general readership, producers, and consumers. However, our newspapers are different from bourgeois newspapers, and the extensive publication of advertisements in newspapers should be opposed. If we analyze the advertisements published in many newspapers this May Day, we will find that many of them were unnecessary. For example, the *Liberation Daily*'s supplement on April 30th listed the names of local state-owned and joint state-private factories under the Shanghai Municipal First Bureau of Heavy Industry, Second Bureau of Heavy Industry, First Bureau of Light Industry, Second Bureau of Light Industry, and the Shanghai Textile Industry Bureau; the *Yangtze Daily* used an entire page to publish the names of production cooperatives (groups) under the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Industry and the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Handicrafts and the Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives; other newspapers also carried similar advertisements. These advertisements neither introduce new products nor introduce seasonal commodities of concern to the masses. How necessary is it to publish them? Many products are distributed uniformly by the state and are not sold on the market, but some newspapers are also extensively advertising them.

The way many newspapers publish advertisements also reflects the bourgeois style of extravagance. Many advertisements are published very large, using fonts that exceed the most important news headlines in the newspaper. For example, an advertisement for the China Department Store Liaoning Provincial Shenyang City Company published in the *Shenyang Daily* occupied nearly half a page, while two other advertisements for the China Hardware and Machinery Company Liaoning Provincial Shenyang City Company and the China Transportation Electrical Equipment Company Liaoning Provincial Shenyang City Company each occupied about one-third of a page. These advertisements were not only in too large of a font, but also had a lot of blank space in the middle, and their length could have been greatly reduced. The overuse of zinc plates is also a characteristic of many newspapers publishing advertisements. *Hubei Daily*, *Chongqing Daily*, and others even made plates for ordinary items such as briquettes and toothbrushes.

Why are many newspapers keen to increase the number of pages and extensively publish advertisements during festivals? It is said that this allows the newspaper to increase its income. Therefore, some newspapers take the initiative to "solicit" advertisements from all parties during festivals. Of course, it is permissible for newspapers to obtain a certain income from operating advertising business in order to save the state's financial expenditure and reduce the burden on readers, and to complete the task of handing over profits. However, our Party newspapers and people's newspapers are not ordinary business units; they are first and foremost political organs. Every line and word published in the newspaper must be considered politically; the same is true for advertising. Newspapers must never only consider their own economic income when dealing with advertising issues, but should first consider the interests of the state and the people. That is to say, first, the advertisements they publish must be selective, and must publish those advertisements that are truly conducive to the country's economic and cultural construction and are indeed needed by the people, rather than accepting all comers, let alone "soliciting" them everywhere. Second, for those advertisements that need to be published, they must also be handled correctly under the principles of saving newspaper space, saving the state's paper and printing capacity, and saving the advertising unit's expenses, rather than demanding that they be published as large as possible. It should be recognized that while newspapers can increase their income by publishing too many and too large advertisements, the paper, printing equipment, distribution and transportation forces, and other expenses spent by the state as a result are not small. Taking paper alone, if national broadsheet dailies each increase by two pages of advertisements during the three festivals of New Year's Day, May Day, and National Day, according to the current circulation of each newspaper, the country will spend an additional 5,220 reams (equivalent to 2.61 million sheets) of newspaper each year. And the production of paper in our country cannot fully meet the needs of the people for a considerable period of time, and some newspapers currently still have to import paper from abroad, so this waste of paper is not allowed. At the same time, newspapers are powerful weapons for conducting ideological education among the people. If the newspapers themselves have serious extravagance and waste in publishing advertisements, how can they educate others with the idea of thrift?

Local newspapers have all opposed the capitalist business ideology in state-owned enterprises. It seems that some newspapers have also shown more or less of this capitalist business ideology in advertising, which should also be opposed.

    反对刊登广告中的铺张浪费现象
    包全
    每逢节日就要出增刊，每出增刊就要登很多广告——这对于不少报纸说来已经成为“惯例”。拿今年“五一”国际劳动节这天的报纸来看，单是全国八大城市（北京、天津、沈阳、上海、西安、武汉、重庆、广州）出版的十五种对开日报中，就有十二种出了增刊，少的两版，多的六版。如把上海解放日报和北京日报在“五一”前后出的增刊也算在内，共计出增刊四十四版。其中广告的篇幅超过了三十版。这说明不少报纸出增刊的目的是为了多登广告。像武汉长江日报“五一”那天出增刊六版，就有五版是广告；天津大公报出增刊四版，全部是广告；沈阳日报、辽宁日报、重庆日报各出增刊四版，广告各占了三版到三版半。
    我们并不是反对在报纸上刊登广告，只要这些广告对广大读者、对生产者和消费者是真正有益的。但是我们的报纸不同于资产阶级的报纸，在报纸上用过多的篇幅大肆刊登广告，却是应当反对的。如果我们对今年“五一”许多报纸刊登的广告稍加分析，就会发现其中有不少是不必要刊登的。如解放日报四月三十日的增刊把上海市第一重工业局、第二重工业局、第一轻工业局、第二轻工业局和上海纺织工业管理局所属的地方国营和公私合营工厂的厂名排列出来；长江日报用整版的篇幅来刊登武汉市工业局和武汉市手工业管理局、手工业生产合作社联合社所属各区生产合作社（组）的名称，其他一些报纸也有类似的广告。这些广告既不是向人们介绍新产品，也不是向人们介绍为群众所关心的季节性商品，究竟有多大的刊登必要呢？有许多产品是由国家统一分配而不向市场出售的，但是有的报纸也在大登广告。
    不少报纸刊登广告的方式，也表现了资产阶级的浮夸作风。许多广告登得很大，所用字体超过了报纸上最重要的新闻标题。像沈阳日报刊登的中国百货公司辽宁省沈阳市公司的一则广告占据了将近半版的地位，另外两则中国五金机械公司辽宁省沈阳市公司和中国交通电工器材公司辽宁省沈阳市公司的广告各占据了大约三分之一版的地位。这些广告不仅字体太大，而且中间留有很多空白，它们的篇幅原是可以大大缩减的。滥用锌版，也是许多报纸刊登广告的特点。湖北日报、重庆日报等甚至将普通的煤球、牙刷等商品的图样也制版印出。
      为什么许多报纸热衷于在节日增加篇幅，大肆刊登广告呢？据说，这样报社就可以增加一笔不小的收入。于是有的报纸每逢节日，就主动向各方面
  “招揽”广告。当然，报社为了节省国家的财政开支和减轻读者的负担，为了完成上缴利润的任务，从经营广告业务中取得一定的收益，这是允许的。但是，我们的党报和人民的报纸并不是什么普通的企业单位，它们首先是政治的机关。报纸上刊登的
  一行一字，都要经过政治上的考虑；对于广告也不例外。报纸在处理广告问题时，绝不能仅仅从自身的经济收入出发，而应当首先从国家和人民的利益出发。这就是说，第一，它刊登的广告要有所选择，要刊登那些真正有利于国家的经济建设和文化建设，确实为人民群众所需要的广告，而不是来者不拒，更不是四出“招揽”。第二，对于那些有必要刊登的广告，也要在节约报纸的篇幅、节约国家的纸张和印刷力、节约刊登广告单位的费用的原则下，加以正确的处理，而不是要求登得越大越好。应当认识，在报纸上刊登过多过大的广告，报社固然可以增加一笔收入，但是国家因此而耗费的纸张、印刷器材、发行运输力量和其它费用却是不少的。单拿纸张来说，如果全国对开日报每逢元旦、
  “五一”、国庆三个节日都增出两版广告，按照各报目前每期发行份数计算，全国每年就要多耗费五千二百二十令（合二百六十一万张）报纸。而我国纸张的生产在相当长的时期内还不能充分满足人民的需要，目前某些报纸的用纸还要从国外进口，因此这种浪费纸张的行为是不能容许的。同时，报纸是对人民群众进行思想教育的有力武器，如果报纸本身在刊登广告中有严重的铺张浪费现象，它又怎能以节约的思想来教育别人呢？
    各地报纸都曾经反对过国营企业中的资本主义经营思想。看起来，某些报纸在刊登广告方面也或多或少地表现了这种资本主义经营思想，这同样是应当反对的。
