(I) To the Editor:

    The Kunming Electric Motor Factory's employees owe a total of about 1,200 yuan (as of May 11th's statistics). Among them, the chief of the finance section, the chief of the planning section, a certain comrade of the wage section, and the chief foreman "borrowed" about half of the total amount. Their lives are not difficult, so why did they borrow so much money? It turns out that they often go on business trips, taking only a simple bedroll when they go out, but returning with large and small packages, utensils, and watches. This is how state funds are occupied by them.

    It is worth noting that this practice has become a trend in the factory. Since 1953, everyone who has been on a business trip has more or less owed money to the public. Some people take the opportunity of "business trips" to go from Beijing to Shanghai to visit relatives, then run to Guilin, Guangxi, to pick up their niece, taking care of a lot of personal matters; after returning to the factory, they complain bitterly about the hardship of "business trips" as a reason for embezzling public funds.

    The above situation reflects, on the one hand, the extremely wrong attitude of these staff members who embezzle public funds and fail to repay them for a long time towards state property; on the other hand, it reflects the shortcomings of the factory's management system. It is hoped that the factory leadership will pay attention to correcting this bad habit of occupying public funds.  Wen He

(II) To the Editor:

    The Northeast Construction Engineering Management Bureau's Harbin First Engineering Company has five cars, and the monthly gasoline consumption always exceeds the quota, sometimes exceeding the quota by nearly three times. Is it because the company has a lot of external contacts and frequent official business? According to the administrative section's vehicle usage statistics, it is not. In forty-one days, the cars were driven a total of two hundred and eighty-eight times, of which only one hundred and fifty-eight trips were for official business. The rest were for personal use: going to the theater, going to the movies, taking baths, buying things, picking up spouses and children, and even visiting relatives and friends, etc. For example, the wife of Party Secretary Zhang works in Pingfang, which is forty-six kilometers away from Harbin. She could have taken the train or bus back and forth, but every time a car was sent to pick her up. The drivers have to work overtime on Sundays and are very busy. The administrative section reported these situations to the leadership, but the answer they received was: "Don't go around in circles in this area in the future."

    The company's manager and the party secretary's four families live in the same dormitory. In order to serve these four families, a cafeteria was specially set up in the dormitory, along with six people including a communicator and a boiler worker. Manager Bian Jing once said at a conference that this was a waste, but after he spoke, the situation did not change.

    We believe that the leading staff of this company need to immediately examine their erroneous attitude towards state property.  Kang Ning Yang Lin

(III) To the Editor:

    Qin Shoufa, the office director of the Shenyang First Electromechanical Installation Engineering Company, always has a dissatisfied look on his face every time he gets paid. Once, he took the deduction slip, strode into the manager's office angrily, slammed it on the table, and said sternly: "My money has been deducted, am I not supposed to eat?" The manager said: "Take your time, there's no need to be so loud!" Qin Shoufa's rude attitude and unexpected complaints went on for nearly three or four hours, and he kept muttering as he walked out of the manager's office.

    It turned out that after Qin Shoufa came to the company, he often borrowed money from the public, together with the public funds he owed to other units before he was transferred, totaling one thousand two hundred and twenty-eight yuan, seven jiao, and two fen. According to the system, money owed to the public should be deducted monthly under conditions that do not affect living conditions. Qin Shoufa and his wife have a monthly income of one hundred and seventy or eighty yuan. Adding three children, the family has five people. Generally speaking, deducting the debt in installments will not affect their lives, but he is not satisfied with every deduction.

    Soon after Qin Shoufa was transferred, he asked the public to send a car to pick him up from work, otherwise, he would have to live near the office. Later, neither the car nor the dormitory problem was solved for him. In a fit of anger, he ran home and did not come to work for six or seven days, until it was almost time to pay him.

    In the movement for increasing production and practicing economy, Qin Shoufa's serious selfish and self-serving thoughts have not been cleared and corrected. To this day, he is still scheming to have all the public funds he owes reimbursed by the public, which is unreasonable.  Li Jin

    反对占公家便宜的恶劣习气
    （一）编辑同志：
    昆明电机厂职工欠款共约一千二百元（五月十一日的统计），其中财务科长、计划科长、工资科某同志和总工长四个人“借支”的款数就占总数的一半左右。他们的生活并不困难，为什么借款那么多呢？原来他们常常因公出差，外出时只带个简单的行李卷，回来时就是大包、小包、用具、手表，带回一大堆。国家资金就这样被他们占用了。
    值得注意的是，这种做法在厂里已经成为一种风气。从一九五三年开始，凡是出差的人或多或少地都欠下了公家的债。有的人借“出差”的机会，从北京去上海探亲，再跑广西桂林去接侄女，大办私事；回厂后，又大诉“出差”之苦，作为挪欠公款的理由。
    上面这些情况，一方面反映了这些挪欠公款、长期不还的工作人员，对待国家财产存在着极端错误的态度；另一方面反映了这个工厂的管理制度也是有缺点的。希望这个工厂领导方面，注意纠正这种占用公款的恶劣风气。  文和

    东北建筑工程管理总局哈尔滨第一工程公司有五辆小汽车，每个月消耗的汽油总要超过定额，有些月份超过了定额将近三倍。是不是因为公司对外联系多，公务往来频繁呢？据行政科车次使用统计数字看来却不是这样的。他们在四十一天中，开车共二百八十八次，其中因公用车的只有一百五十八次，其余都是私人看戏、看电影、洗澡、买东西、接送爱人和小孩，甚至访亲寻友等等。例如，党委张书记的爱人在离哈尔滨四十六公里的平房工作，本来可以坐火车或公共汽车来回，但是每次都要派小汽车接送。司机同志每到星期天就要加班加点，忙个不停。行政科曾把这些情况向领导方面提出过，但是得到的回答却是：“以后不要在这方面打圈子。”
    公司的经理和党委书记四家人住在一个宿舍里。为了给这四家服务，宿舍里专门办了一个食堂，还有通讯员、烧锅炉工人等六个人。边敬经理曾在大会上说过这是浪费，但他讲过之后，这种情况并没有改变。
    我们认为，这个公司的领导工作人员有必要立即检查一下对待国家财产的错误态度。                                康宁　杨林
    （三）编辑同志：
    沈阳第一机电安装工程公司办公室主任秦守法每次发薪时都带着一股不满意的情绪。有一次，他拿着扣款条子，怒气冲冲地走进经理室，使劲往桌上一摔，厉声地说：“我的钱让人家扣啦，还让我吃饭不？”经理说：“有事慢慢商量，不用这样吵！”秦守法的粗暴态度和出乎意外的牢骚发了将近三、四个小时，在走出经理室的时候还不住地嘟囔着。
    原来，秦守法来到公司以后，常常向公家借钱，连同他没有调来以前在别的单位欠下的公款，总数达到一千二百二十八元七角二分。欠了公家的钱，按制度应在不影响生活的条件下逐月扣还。秦守法夫妇每月有一百七、八十元的收入，加上三个孩子，全家五口人，一般说分期扣还欠款，是不会影响生活的，但他对每次扣款都不满意。
    秦守法刚调来不久，就要求公家派小汽车接送他上班和下班，否则，就让他住到办公室的附近来。后来汽车和宿舍问题都没有给他解决，他一怒跑回家去了，一连六、七天也没来上班，直到快要发薪的时候，他才来上班。
    在增产节约运动中，秦守法严重的自私自利的思想还没有得到清算和纠正。直到今天，他所欠下的一切公款，仍然在打着算盘要公家报销，这是没有道理的。                                  李晋
