Xinhua News Agency, June 18th. The Hungarian Textile Testing Instrument Exhibition, held at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, concluded on June 18th.

    During the exhibition, it was visited by over 9,000 people, including leaders and experts from the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Local Industry, and other relevant departments, as well as experts, professors, engineers, inspection and testing personnel, model workers, and working cadres from textile factories and textile colleges in Beijing, Tianjin, Northeast China, Qingdao, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chongqing, and other cities. Personnel from the embassies of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and seven other countries, as well as the trade delegation from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, also visited the exhibition.

    Visitors unanimously gave high praise to Hungary's scientific research achievements in textile technology. Many engineers considered it "a short-term school for learning advanced technology."

    During the exhibition, in addition to providing on-site explanations, Hungarian experts held fourteen special lectures, attended by over 3,000 people. Mr. Földes, Director of the Hungarian Textile Research Institute and Head of the Hungarian Textile Testing Instrument Exhibition Delegation, and other experts also gave special lectures on topics such as "The Significance of Textile Scientific Research for the Development of the National Economy of People's Democratic Countries," "Polarized Light Determination of Cotton Quality," "Automatic Measurement of Fiber Length," "The Problem of Hemp Degumming," and "The Problem of Chinese Wool Classification." They systematically introduced the organization, steps, and methods of Hungary's scientific research work in textile technology, as well as how to use scientific principles such as optics and mechanics to conduct experiments, improve instruments and equipment, and check the length, uniformity, and wear resistance of various fibers and textiles, in order to ensure the economical use of raw materials and supply the people with durable textiles. At the same time, Hungarian experts also provided practical technical guidance to inspection personnel in relevant agencies.

    匈牙利纺织试验仪器展览会结束
    新华社十八日讯　在北京天坛举行的匈牙利纺织试验仪器展览会十八日结束。
    展览会展出期间，前往参观的有纺织工业部、轻工业部、地方工业部和其他有关各部门的负责人、专家，以及来自北京、天津、东北、青岛、上海、武汉、广州、西安、重庆等城市的纺织厂和纺织专科学校的专家、教授、工程师、检验试验人员、劳动模范、工作干部九千多人。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等七个国家的大使馆人员和越南民主共和国贸易代表团也都先后参观了展览会。
    参观者对于匈牙利在纺织技术方面的科学研究成果，一致给予很高的评价。很多工程师认为“这是一个学习先进技术的短期学校”。
    展出期间，匈牙利专家除作现场讲解外，并先后举行了十四次专题讲座，听讲的有三千多人。匈牙利纺织研究院院长、匈牙利纺织试验仪器展览会代表团团长弗尔德士和其他专家还先后就“纺织科学研究工作对发展人民民主国家国民经济的意义”
  “棉花品质的偏振光测定法”“纤维长度的自动测定”“大麻脱胶问题”“中国羊毛分类问题”等问题作了专题讲解，系统地介绍了匈牙利开展纺织技术科学研究工作的组织、步骤和方法，以及如何运用光学、机械学等科学原理来进行试验、改进仪器设备，检查各种纤维的长度、均匀度及纺织品的耐穿度等，以保证节约地使用原料，并供应人民以经久耐用的纺织品。同时，匈牙利专家还曾到有关机关对检验人员作了实地技术指导。
