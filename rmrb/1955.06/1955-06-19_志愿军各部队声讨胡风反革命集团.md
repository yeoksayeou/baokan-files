Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 18th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units have universally launched various activities to denounce the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

    The Political Department of the Volunteer Army issued an instruction in early June, requiring the entire army to organize reading and discussion of materials exposing the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and calling on the broad masses of cadres and all soldiers to strive to improve their political vigilance and ability to distinguish counter-revolutionary elements, and resolutely and thoroughly fight to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

    On the morning of the 16th, Wang Yongnian, Deputy Director of the Cultural Department of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army, gave a report on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to more than 400 cadres from the leading organs of the Volunteer Army and various arms of the services. The report pointed out that the struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements is a task that the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country cannot slacken in the slightest. In the afternoon of the same day, the Youth Department of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army convened a forum of youth workers, grassroots cadres of the Communist Youth League, and youth meritorious personnel from organs directly under the Volunteer Army, troops, and various arms of the services. At the meeting, Dong Min, a second-class meritorious person, said: "Now we can fully see that the Hu Feng clique is a group of counter-revolutionary elements connected with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. We must never allow them to 'seek rebirth in suffering' again. We demand that this group of counter-revolutionary elements be resolutely and thoroughly eliminated!"

    Many Volunteer Army units, vigilantly guarding their positions, have also held report meetings and forums to denounce the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers have written letters to the "People's Daily," demanding the resolute suppression of Hu Feng and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.
