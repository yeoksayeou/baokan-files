Thoroughly Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
Hou Debang

I once thought that Hu Feng was just a writer with an idealist bent; his errors were the same as those of some literary and scientific workers, merely committing some mistakes of idealist thought. However, Hu Feng was more arrogant, a self-proclaimed, self-important "I am the greatest" type of person. But after the "People's Daily" published three batches of materials, I realized more and more clearly that Hu Feng was not only an idealist, but a thorough counter-revolutionary and anti-people reactionary. He formed a clique, engaged in covert, insidious activities, and attempted to undermine the leadership of the Party and the working class.

Hu Shih's reactionary behavior is easily seen by everyone. In academic terms, Hu Shih tried to peddle the "Pragmatism" ideology of American imperialism to China in a comprador manner. But Hu Feng was even more cunning. He wore the cloak of Marxism, pretended to be progressive, allowed his followers to infiltrate Party organizations, steal intelligence, and used despicable and malicious double-dealing tactics to conspire to undermine the Chinese revolution. Stripped of his disguise, his true form is nakedly revealed.

Hu Feng is a heinous and audacious person. From before liberation to after liberation, he has consistently engaged in anti-Party and anti-people activities. He took advantage of the magnanimity of our Party and people to carry out his hidden and malicious activities wantonly. As for Hu Feng and his clique, it is necessary to thoroughly expose all their crimes and severely punish them according to the law. This is a profound education for us, so that some people who are not clear in their understanding will not be deceived by him again in the future. Hu Feng's crimes are no longer a matter of ideology, but are indeed anti-Party and anti-people in action. He is a madman who dreams of usurping the leadership of the Party. I feel boundless anger. I believe that for the sake of a happy socialist life and a bright future for mankind, Hu Feng and the core members of his clique must be severely punished.

From the exposure of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary activities, it can be seen that our work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries must continue to be strengthened. We must continue to raise our vigilance, distinguish between friends and enemies, and, under the principle of "not wronging a single good person," severely and thoroughly smash this counter-revolutionary clique.

    彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    侯德榜
    我曾以为胡风只是一个唯心主义的文艺作家，他的错误，也和某些文艺工作者和科学工作者一样，是犯了些唯心主义思想的错误。不过胡风更狂妄些，是一个自命不凡、自以为“老子天下第一”的人物罢了。可是从“人民日报”公布了三批材料后，我一次比一次清楚地认识到胡风不仅是一个唯心主义者，而且是一个彻头彻尾的反革命反人民的反动分子。他搞集团，进行隐蔽的阴险活动，想破坏党和工人阶级的领导权。
    胡适的反动行为，是大家容易看得出来的。胡适在学术上以买办方式，企图把美帝国主义的“实用主义”思想，贩卖到中国来。但胡风却是更狡猾，他披着马克思主义的外衣，伪装进步，令其党羽钻进党的组织，盗窃情报，以卑鄙恶毒的两面派的手段，阴谋破坏中国的革命。剥去他的外衣后，他的原形赤裸裸地露出来了。
    胡风是罪大恶极，胆大妄为的人。从解放以前到解放以后，一贯地进行反党反人民的勾当。他借着我们的党和人民的宽厚心怀，肆行其隐蔽的恶毒活动。对胡风及其集团，还必须彻底揭露他们的一切罪状，依法严惩。这是对我们的一次深刻的教育，使认识不清的一部分人，今后不致再受其蒙骗。胡风的罪行，已不是一个思想的问题，而是的的确确在行动上反党反人民的。他是妄想篡夺党的领导权的丧心病狂的人。我感到无比的愤怒。我以为为了社会主义的幸福生活，为了人类美好的将来，对胡风及其集团骨干分子必须予以严重惩罚。
    从胡风的反革命活动的揭发，可以看出，我们镇压反革命的工作，必须继续加强。我们必须继续提高警惕，分清敌友，在“不冤屈一个好人”的原则下，严厉地彻底地粉碎这个反革命集团。
