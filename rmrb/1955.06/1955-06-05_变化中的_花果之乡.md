	The Changing "Land of Fruits and Flowers"
	Zhong Xia

	North of Changli County town, Hebei Province, lies a verdant belt of trees, nestled against the east-west running Jieshi Mountains. This is the famous Changli "Land of Fruits and Flowers" in North China.

	The orchards after the rain appear exceptionally lush green. The tender tendrils of the grape vines stretch out, laden with clusters of small apples, some already the size of walnuts. The soil around the base of the fruit trees is meticulously tilled and moist. Farmers, in high spirits, are actively engaged in preventing and controlling fruit tree diseases, anticipating a bountiful harvest season.

	This year, farmers have implemented better technical measures in pruning, tilling, and fertilizing fruit trees compared to previous years. For example, in the XingShuYuan Township, only 40% of the pear trees were pruned last year, but this year the pruning rate has increased to over 85%. In the Houliangshan Sun Fengzhu Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, almost all kinds of fruit trees have been pruned this year, and fertilization and tilling have also surpassed last year's levels. Under the specific guidance of the "Demonstration Garden" established by the "Hebei Province Changli Fruit Tree Experimental Farm," this cooperative has changed the phenomenon of fruit branches "resting" and has begun to achieve "big years" (i.e., harvest years; resting branches are called "small years") with bountiful yields every year. Last year, when most pear trees were "resting" and the market was short of pears, Sun Fengzhu's pear trees still had a bumper harvest, supplying tens of thousands of pounds of fresh pears to meet market demand. This "Demonstration Garden" has become a base for technical improvement in the "Land of Fruits and Flowers."

	The support of the People's Government and economic departments for the fruit tree area has also promoted the development of fruit production. In the first quarter of this year, the government issued more than 5,500 yuan in loans to the fruit area and prepared a large number of medicines and machinery for preventing and controlling fruit tree pests and diseases for use in the fruit area. The supply of sprayers has increased from 30 last year to 60 this year, the supply of sulfur powder has increased to more than 8,000 jin, and "Bordeaux mixture" and other chemicals have also increased compared to last year. Supply and marketing cooperatives also use pre-purchase contracts to transport and sell the products of the fruit area at reasonable prices.

	The Changli fruit tree area includes eight townships and twenty-three villages, stretching more than thirty li from east to west. The production volume is about 8 million jin. The main products are pears, grapes, and apples. The pear varieties alone include more than twenty kinds such as Honey Pear, Duck Pear, Jingbai Pear, and Snowflake Pear. The most famous grapes are Rose Fragrant, Longan, and Agate. Through the enthusiastic cultivation of the farmers, the yield of these excellent varieties has been increasing year by year. In the past two or three years, more than 50,000 new seedlings have been added, and the earlier planted ones have begun to bear fruit. The continuous improvement of fruit tree technical management and the start of production of newly planted fruit trees will enable the people of the Land of Fruits and Flowers to receive more income.

    变化中的“花果之乡”
    仲夏
    在河北省昌黎县城的北面，有一片青翠的林带，背倚着东西横亘的碣石山。这就是华北著名的昌黎“花果之乡”。
    雨后的果林显得分外浓绿，葡萄的柔嫩的卷须长长地伸展着，累累满枝的小苹果，有些已像胡桃那样大了，果树根部周围的土壤整理得匀细而湿润，农民们热情高涨地正在进行着防治果树病害的活动，他们在期待着一个丰收季节的到来。
    今年农民们对果树的整枝、翻土、施肥等技术措施都比往年作得好。如杏树园乡的梨树，去年只有百分之四十进行了修剪，今年修剪增加到百分之八十五以上。后两山孙凤竹农林生产合作社的各种果树，今年差不多全部进行了修剪，其他施肥、翻土等也超过去年。这个社在“河北省昌黎果树试验场”所建立的“示范园”的具体指导下，已经改变了果枝“歇枝”的现象，开始做到年年是“大年”（即收获年，歇枝叫“小年”）年年丰产。去年在多数梨树“歇枝”、市场缺梨的情况下，孙凤竹的梨树照样丰收，以数万斤鲜梨供应了市场需要。这个“示范园”已成为“花果之乡”技术改良的基地。
    人民政府和经济部门对果树区的扶植也促进了果产的发展。今年第一季政府即给果区发放了五千五百多元的贷款，并准备了大批防治果树病虫害的药械，供给果区使用。供应的喷雾器由去年的三十架增加到了六十架，硫磺粉增加到八千多斤，“波而多液”等也较去年增多。供销合作社并以预购合同形式，以合理价格运销果区的产品。
    昌黎果树区包括八个乡二十三个村庄，东西漫长三十多里。生产量约八百多万斤。产品以梨、葡萄、苹果为大宗。仅梨的品种即有蜜梨、鸭梨、京白梨、雪花梨等二十多种，葡萄以玫瑰香、龙眼、玛瑙最驰名。这些优良的品种，经过农民热心培植，产量逐年提高。新的树苗，近两三年来也增加了五万多株，栽植较早的已开始结果了。果树技术管理的不断改进和新植果树的开始生产，将使花果之乡的人民得到更多的收入。
