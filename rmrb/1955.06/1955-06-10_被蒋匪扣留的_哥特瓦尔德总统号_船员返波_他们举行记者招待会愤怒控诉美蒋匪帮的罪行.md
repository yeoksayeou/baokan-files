(Poland Press Agency dispatch) The nineteen crew members of the Polish merchant ship "President Gottwald", hijacked by Chiang Kai-shek pirates in the Taiwan Strait in May 1954, have regained their freedom through the continuous efforts of the Polish government and people, as well as the people of various countries, and returned to their homeland on May 26th, where they were warmly welcomed. After returning to Poland, they held a press conference to accuse the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang of their crimes and introduced their heroic struggles during their detention.

    Navigator Piotr Ziępięc said: "We lived in prison, and they treated us with inhumane means." The crew members were separated, and people were monitored individually or together. The Party Branch Secretary Bogusław Bieniarz and Deputy Captain Bieniu Narożniak were held in isolation.

    Ziępięc said: "The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang tried to make them betray their country and serve the enemy, but when they found that they could neither persuade nor intimidate me, they used promises to lure me. They said that I could get two hundred dollars a month, and their American masters could let me go to any place I liked: to America, Australia, or to other Western countries.”

    "They also told me that everyone else had signed the political asylum letter, and that I was the only stubborn one. Later, I learned that my partners were also told that I had signed the political asylum letter."

    Second mate Daskoski said that during the interrogation of the Polish crew members, an American officer always stayed in a room next door, listening to the Chiang Kai-shek personnel's reports on the progress of the interrogation and issuing instructions to them.

    The crew members talked about various forms of struggle. Grzyśkiewicz said: "We have carried out several hunger strikes. On November 15, 1954, we started the longest hunger strike lasting seven days."

    被蒋匪扣留的“哥特瓦尔德总统号”船员返波
    他们举行记者招待会愤怒控诉美蒋匪帮的罪行
    本报讯　据波兰通讯社讯：一九五四年五月在台湾海峡被蒋介石海盗劫去的波兰“哥特瓦尔德总统号”商船的十九名船员，在波兰政府和人民以及各国人民的不断努力营救下，已重新获得自由，并在五月二十六日回到了他们的祖国，受到热烈的欢迎。他们在回到波兰以后举行了记者招待会，控诉美蒋匪帮的罪行，并介绍了他们在被扣留期间的英勇斗争。
    驾驶员庇奥特·詹皮奇说：“我们住在监狱里，他们用灭绝人性的手段对付我们。”船员们都被分隔开，人们单独时或在一起时都被监视着。党支部书记波哥斯劳·别纳茹克和副船长比纽·纳若科特被隔离着看管起来。
    詹皮奇说：“蒋介石匪帮曾经企图使他们背叛祖国，为敌人服务，但是“当他们发现既不能说服，也不能吓倒我时，他们就用诺言来引诱我。他们说我每月可以得到二百美元，并且他们的美国主子能够让我到任何我喜欢去的地方：到美国，澳大利亚或到其他西方国家去。”
    “他们还告诉我，其他人都已在政治避难书上签了字，而我是唯一顽固的人。以后，我知道我的伙伴们也被告诉说我已经在政治避难书上签了字。”
    二副达司科斯基说，在审讯波兰船员期间，一个美国军官始终停留在隔壁的一个房间里，听蒋匪人员关于审讯进展情况的汇报，并对他们发出指示。
    船员们谈到各种方式的斗争。格兹斯可维克说：“我们曾进行了几次绝食斗争。在一九五四年十一月十五日，我们开始了持续七天的时间最长的绝食斗争。”
