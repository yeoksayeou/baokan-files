    We have developed the habit of saving cotton
    Editor:
      "Cherishing cotton and saving raw cotton" has become a habit among the workers of our Tianjin No. 4 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory. According to recent statistics, the entire factory saved a total of 73,600 catties of cotton in the first five months of this year.
    The workers cherish cotton very much. Workers who operate the opening and cleaning machines and the fine cleaning machines can pick up about one or two taels of cotton from the ground every day. They often say: saving one or two taels of cotton seems like a small thing, but over time it becomes a considerable amount. In order not to waste any cotton, the cotton feeding workers and machine operators pick off small pieces of cotton from the machines when cleaning them every day. Worker Qi Jiguang suggested in November of last year that the broken seeded cotton taken out from under the machines should be sifted with a sieve. This way, nearly ten catties of cotton can be sifted out in three shifts a day.
    The main task of the opening and cleaning workshop is to make raw cotton into cotton laps. In the past, there were many cases of rework due to non-compliance with specifications. Raw cotton was lost in the rework of waste cotton. Many workers in our factory actively participated in learning the advanced operating method of "starting new laps with waste cotton and dividing cotton laps into sections" summarized at the National Opening and Cleaning Carding Professional Conference in March. Han Enfu, a fine cleaning machine operator, went to the cultural palace to listen to technical classes after work in order to master this operating method as soon as possible. He said:
  “I feel sad when I see unqualified cotton laps returned for rework. With advanced operating methods, how can I not study hard?” Now the cotton laps produced by Han Enfu basically meet the specifications. The situation of unqualified cotton laps in the entire workshop has changed significantly in May.
    In February of this year, we improved the airflow baffles of the porcupine-type opening machine and the curtain feeding machine, and enlarged the spacing of the dust bars. As a result, the white cotton rate in the waste cotton was reduced, and about 20 catties of cotton can be saved in three shifts a day. In March, our technical research team improved the distance of the exhaust air knife, and more than 18 catties of cotton can be saved in three shifts a day.
    Today, when agricultural production cannot keep up with the needs of industrial development, saving cotton is a very important matter for our textile workers. In the future, while ensuring product quality, we will come up with more ways to save cotton.

### 我们养成了节约棉花的习惯

    我们养成了节约棉花的习惯编辑同志：
      “爱惜棉花，节约原棉”在我们国营天津第四棉纺织厂的工人中间已经养成了习惯。据最近统计，今年头五个月里，全厂一共节约了棉花七万三千六百多斤。
    工人们对棉花是非常爱惜的。看荒打机、细打机的工人，每人每天大约都能从地上拣起一两多棉花。他们常常说：节约一两棉花好像是很小的事情，但是日久天长就不是一个小数目了。喂花工人和值车工人为了不浪费一点棉花，在每天清扫机车时都要先把机器上的小块棉花摘下来。工人齐继刚在去年十一月份就建议把车底掏出来的破籽花用筛子筛，一天三班就可以筛出近十斤的棉花。
    清花车间的主要工作是把原棉制成棉卷，过去因为不合规格而返工的情况很多。在返工的落棉中就要损失原棉。今年三月全国清花钢丝浆纱专业会议所总结出的“落卷生头，棉卷分段”的先进操作法，我们厂里许多工人都积极地参加了学习。细打机值车工人韩恩福为了尽快掌握这一操作法，下班后跑到文化宫去听技术课，他说：
  “我看见不合格的棉卷退回来返工，心里就难过。有了先进的操作方法，还能不好好的学吗？”现在韩恩福生产的棉卷基本上符合规格。五月份全车间棉卷不合格的情况已经显著改变了。
    今年二月份我们改进了豪猪式开棉机和帘子给棉机的气流板，放大了尘棒隔距，结果减少了落棉中的白花率，一天三班大约可以节约二十多斤棉花。三月份我们的技术研究小组改进了排气式风刀的距离，一天三班又可以节约十八斤多棉花。
    在农业生产赶不上工业发展需要的今天，节约棉花对我们纺织工人来说是一件很重要的事。今后在保证产品质量的基础上，我们还要想出更多的办法来节约棉花。　　　范宝祥　陈志
