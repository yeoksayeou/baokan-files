Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: The railway department, implementing the spirit of comprehensive economy, has initially determined a plan to save the nation over 590 million yuan in construction funds from 1955 to 1957, without reducing the originally planned railway construction projects. In order to save investment while ensuring project quality, the Ministry of Railways has also formulated sixty technical and organizational measures accordingly.

There are some excessively high design standards and prematurely invested projects in the railway department's new line projects and technical renovation of old lines, indicating great potential for saving national funds. Many projects are being built larger than necessary, with more being done than required, higher construction costs than needed, and even unnecessary projects being undertaken. For example, the stations along the Jining-Erlian line are very remote, yet they adopted so-called national-style architectural designs. On the lines west of Lanzhou and from Baoji to Chengdu, some stations with only dozens of passengers getting on and off each day have platforms that are larger than those at the Shanghai station. The cost of the toilets at the Mianyang station on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway reached 298 yuan per square meter, exceeding the cost of ordinary housing by four times. At the Wushaoling station on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, a toilet was even mistaken for the stationmaster's office. Due to the excessively high standards, the average cost of stations and buildings along newly built railways in 1955 reached 108 yuan per square meter, greatly exceeding the State Council's regulations. The Ministry of Railways has now decided to lower the standards in accordance with the regulations, stipulating that the cost of productive buildings should not exceed 70 yuan per square meter, and dormitories should be between 20 and 50 yuan per square meter. It is estimated that by lowering design standards and correcting unreasonable and unrealistic designs, a significant amount of investment can be saved for the nation within three years.

A portion of the funds will be saved from projects that can be invested in phases. For example, according to the original regulations of the Ministry of Railways, 1,840 railway sleepers were to be laid per kilometer of newly built trunk lines. Recent studies have shown that in the early stages of operation of new lines, the general traffic volume will not be too large, and the investment in 240 fewer sleepers per kilometer can be reduced, and the thickness of the ballast can also be reduced. In addition, some permanent cultural and welfare facilities, such as large auditoriums and clubs, which were originally planned to be built, have now been decided to be postponed.

A large sum of money will also be saved by taking measures to prevent waste, conserve materials, improve construction organization, increase the utilization rate of machinery and equipment, and increase labor productivity.

The Ministry of Railways' measures to reduce costs and save investment were formulated based on the waste phenomena and unreasonable designs exposed by the inspection team led by Railway Minister Teng Daiyuan during their inspection of railway work in the Northwest and Southwest regions from April 15th to the end of May.

    铁路部门初步订出三年节约方案
    将为国家节约资金五亿九千万元
    新华社二十日讯 铁路部门贯彻全面节约精神，已初步确定在原定铁路建设项目不减少的情况下，从一九五五年到一九五七年内为国家节约建设资金五亿九千多万元的方案。为了节约投资同时保证工程质量，铁道部并已相应地订出了六十项技术组织措施。
    铁路部门新线工程和旧线技术改造的设计标准有一部分是过高的，有一部分是过早投资的，可以节约国家资金的潜力很大。很多工程该小的做大了，该少的做多了，造价该低的做高了，甚至不必要的也做了。如集宁—二连线沿线车站都很偏僻，也采用了所谓民族形式的建筑设计；兰州以西线路和宝鸡到成都线路有些每天只有几十个旅客上下的车站，站台修得比上海车站的站台还大些；宝成铁路绵阳车站的厕所造价达到每平方公尺二百九十八元，超过一般房屋造价四倍，兰新铁路乌鞘岭车站上有个厕所甚至被人误认为站长办公室。由于标准过高，一九五五年新建铁路沿线的车站和房屋造价平均达到每平方公尺一百零八元，大大超过了国务院的规定。这次铁道部已决定按规定降低标准，而生产性建筑每平方公尺造价不得超过七十元，宿舍每平方公尺二十元到五十元。预计在降低设计标准，改正不合理的和不切实际的设计以后，三年内就可为国家节约大量投资。
    有一部分资金将从可以分期投资的工程中节约出来。譬如按照铁道部原来规定，新建铁路干线每公里要铺一千八百四十根枕木。最近研究，在新线开始营业的初期，一般运量不会太大，每公里可减少二百四十根枕木的投资，石碴的厚度也可以减薄一些。此外，原来打算修建的一些永久性文化福利设施，如大礼堂、俱乐部之类，现在也决定推迟修建。
    一大笔资金还将由于采取一些防止浪费、节约材料、改善施工组织、提高机具设备利用率、提高劳动生产率等措施而节省出来。
    这次铁道部关于降低造价节约投资的措施，是根据铁道部长滕代远所率领的检查组四月十五日到五月底在西北和西南地区检查铁路工作时所揭发的浪费现象和不合理的设计而制定的。
