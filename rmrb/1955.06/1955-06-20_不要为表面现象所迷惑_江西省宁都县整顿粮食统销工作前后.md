Don't Be Misled by Surface Appearances
——Before and After the Rectification of Grain Unified Sales Work in Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province
By Our Correspondent Sun Zunian

Since March, the grain supply situation in Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province, has become tense. Farmers lacking grain want to buy grain; self-sufficient households are worried and also want to buy grain; in addition, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries are spreading rumors and sabotage, and some people who do not understand the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain are taking the opportunity to buy grain and hoard it. The grain supply certificates issued for the entire county up to July would empty the existing warehouses and still leave a shortage of 7.48 million jin of rice. Under these circumstances, county and district staff were alarmed and asked their superiors to allocate grain.

Is there really such a shortage of grain in the countryside? Of course not. After receiving instructions from the Jiangxi Provincial Committee and the Gannan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on strengthening the unified sales work of grain in rural areas, the Ningdu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an enlarged county committee meeting on April 1st. They carefully analyzed the reasons for the grain shortage and compared the county's total grain output last year, the amount of grain purchased by the county last year, the rations and revolving grain left for farmers, and the figures for seeds, carefully calculating the accounts. The result of the calculation showed that the county's grain was not only sufficient for all the county's farmers to eat, but the state could also withdraw more than 4.7 million jin of rice for supply grain from the rural areas.

In order to overcome the chaotic phenomena in the unified grain sales work, after the enlarged county committee meeting, the Ningdu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately organized a work team of eighty-one people and sent them to various districts and townships to carry out the rectification of grain unified sales work in conjunction with leading production. According to the survey materials, the reasons for the chaotic phenomena in the grain unified sales work are as follows: First, the supply system is chaotic, the issuance of supply certificates is not strict, and the supply scope is too wide, giving those who speculate and hoard grain the opportunity to impact the national grain market. This has created a phenomenon in which those with money buy grain to hoard it, while farmers with little grain and those who are truly short of grain cannot get a supply. In Changsheng Township, Changsheng District of this county, out of 846 households, 795 households were issued supply certificates, accounting for 94 percent of the total number of households. The grain supply in Luokou District even exceeded the county's quota by 560,000 jin. In Keshuh and Luxie townships in this district, out of 625 households, 36 households should not have been supplied, accounting for 5.7 percent of the total number of households. Each household was over-supplied with an average of 297 jin of grain. There were 137 households that were under-supplied or over-supplied, accounting for 21 percent of the total number of households. Each household was over-supplied with an average of 84 jin of grain. One family with only one person was even supplied with more than 1,000 jin of rice. Yu Guobing, a middle peasant in Xiaopu Township, Xiaopu District of this county, asked the township people's committee for a supply four or five times for three people to eat, and was issued a supply certificate for 400 jin of grain. The next day, he bought back 250 jin. After investigation, he was found to have hoarded 2,100 jin of grain at home. Li Zicai, a farmer in Zhongcha Township, Luokou District, had hoarded as much as 4,000 jin of grain. However, the more grain people hoard, the more they claim to be short of grain. Similar situations are very common throughout the county. Second, last year's unified grain purchase was not thorough enough. According to the survey in Keshuh and Luxie townships, Luokou District, out of 625 households in the two townships, 125 households (accounting for 20 percent of the total number of households) still had a surplus of 30,271 jin of grain, with an average surplus of 242 jin per household. These households are all desperately claiming to be short of grain. Third, not enough attention is paid to saving grain in rural areas. According to the survey in Keshuh and Luxie townships, Luokou District, 63 households (accounting for 10 percent of the total number of households), after careful calculation, can save 10,170 jin of grain, with an average of 161 jin of grain saved per household. According to the total of three items: unreasonable supply, incomplete unified purchase of surplus grain, and grain that can be saved, Keshuh and Luxie townships still have a surplus of 61,772 jin of rice. Excluding the 22 households that are short-supplied or over-supplied, accounting for 3.5 percent of the total number of households, and the 66 farmers who are short of grain, accounting for 10.5 percent of the total number of households, who need to be supplemented with 16,900 jin of rice, most farmers actually still have surplus grain.

According to the survey results of Keshuh and Luxie townships, it proves that the grain shortage situation in rural areas is not as serious as those who do not understand the real situation in rural areas say; it also proves that the chaos in grain supply work is not because the state supplies less grain, but because those who should not be supplied are also supplied, resulting in an unreasonable supply. Based on this situation, the Ningdu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party publicized the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain to the broad masses of farmers and vigorously rectified the grain unified sales work. For example, after ten rural party members in Wucun District understood the grain unified sales policy, they voluntarily took out 2,800 jin of over-supplied rice, and township and village staff in sixteen townships returned 3,600 jin of over-supplied grain, leading more than 80 farmers in the district to return 14,600 jin of over-supplied rice. Facts have proved that after mobilizing the masses in depth, the tense grain supply situation immediately changed. Farmers who had been over-supplied in the past voluntarily returned grain to the state, farmers who were not short of grain no longer shouted for a supply, and farmers who were short of grain received a reasonable supply. The farmers' production enthusiasm was high, and the staff's work enthusiasm was sufficient.

Now the county's daily grain sales have dropped to about 100,000 jin, a decrease of more than half compared to the daily sales of 230,000 jin before the rectification of grain unified sales work in late March, reaching a normal grain supply level.

    不要为表面现象所迷惑
    ——江西省宁都县整顿粮食统销工作前后
    本报记者　孙祖年
    三月份以来，江西省宁都县粮食供应情况紧张了。缺粮的农民要购粮；自给户顾虑重重，也要购粮；再加地主、富农、反革命分子造谣破坏，一些不明粮食统购统销政策的人就乘机购粮囤积。全县发到七月份的粮食供应证，把现有仓库粮食扫净，还少七百四十八万斤稻谷。在这种情况下，县、区工作人员都着慌了，纷纷向上级要求调拨粮食。
    农村中真的是这样缺粮食吗？当然不是。中共宁都县委接到中共江西省委、赣南区党委关于加强农村粮食统销工作的指示后，于四月一日召开了县委扩大会议，认真分析了粮食紧张的原因，并对比全县去年各种粮食的总产量、去年全县的征购粮、农民留下的口粮和周转粮、种子等数字，仔细算了一笔账。算账的结果，全县粮食不但足够全县农民食用，而且国家还可以从农村中抽回四百七十多万斤稻谷的供应粮。
    为了克服粮食统销工作中的混乱现象，中共宁都县委在县委扩大会议后，立即组织了八十一人的工作队，分赴各区、乡，结合领导生产开展了整顿粮食统销的工作。根据调查材料来看，产生粮食统销工作混乱现象的原因有以下几个方面：一、供应制度混乱，发供应证不严，供应面过宽，给了投机囤积粮食的人以冲击国家粮食市场的机会。这样就造成了有钱的人把粮食买去囤积了，而少粮和真正缺粮的农民反得不到供应的现象。这个县的长胜区长胜乡八百四十六户，发证供应的就有七百九十五户，占总户数百分之九十四。洛口区的粮食供应量竟超过县给的指标五十六万斤。这个区的柯树、芦斜两个乡，共六百二十五户，经调查，不该供应而供应的有三十六户，占总户数百分之五点七，每户平均多供应了粮食二百九十七斤，缺少供多的有一百三十七户，占总户数百分之二十一，每户平均多供应了粮食八十四斤，有一家只有一口人，竟供应了一千多斤大米。这个县的小浦区小浦乡中农余国炳三个人吃饭，向乡人民委员会要求供应四、五次，发给了四百斤粮食的供应证，第二天就买回二百五十斤，经过调查，他家里还囤积粮食二千一百斤。洛口区中茶乡农民李自才囤积的粮食竟有四千斤。可是，囤积粮食越多的人叫缺粮越厉害。类似这种情况，在全县是很普遍的。二、去年的粮食统购不彻底。根据洛口区柯树、芦斜两乡的调查，两乡共六百二十五户，就有一百二十五户（占总户数的百分之二十）还有余粮三万零二百七十一斤，平均每户有余粮二百四十二斤。这些户都是拚命叫缺粮的户。三、农村中对节约粮食不够重视。据洛口区柯树、芦斜两乡的调查，有六十三户（占总户数百分之十）经过算细账，可以节约出粮食一万零一百七十斤，平均每户可节约粮食一百六十一斤。根据供应不合理、余粮统购不彻底以及可以节约的粮食三项合计，柯树、芦斜两乡还有余粮稻谷六万一千七百七十二斤。这两个乡除缺多供少的二十二户，占总户数百分之三点五，以及缺粮农民六十六户，占总户数百分之十点五，需要补进供应稻谷一万六千九百斤外，实际上大多数农民都还有余粮。
    根据柯树、芦斜这两个乡调查的结果来看，证明农村粮食紧张情况，并不像那些不了解农村真实情况的人说得那么严重；也证明了粮食供应工作混乱，不是因为国家供应粮食少了，而是因为给不应该供应的人也供应了，造成了供应的不合理。中共宁都县委根据这个情况，向广大农民宣传了粮食统购统销政策，大力整顿了粮食统销工作。例如吴村区十个农村党员了解了粮食统销政策后，自动拿出多供应的稻谷二千八百斤，十六个乡的乡、村工作人员退回了多供应粮三千六百斤，带动了全区八十多户农民退回了多供应的稻谷一万四千六百斤。事实证明，经过深入发动群众以后，那种粮食供应紧张局面立即改变了，过去多供应了的农民自动向国家退回了粮食，不缺粮的农民不再叫喊要供应了，缺粮的农民得到了合理的供应。农民的生产情绪高涨了，工作人员的工作劲头足了。
    现在全县粮食日销量已降到十万斤左右，比三月下旬整顿粮食统销工作以前日销量二十三万斤降低了二分之一还多，达到了正常的粮食供应水平。
