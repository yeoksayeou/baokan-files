    Xintai Qia Sauce Factory Uses Silkworm Pupae to Make Soy Sauce
    The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry successfully experimented at the local state-owned Suzhou Xintai Qia Sauce Factory with using silkworm pupae, from which silkworm pupae oil has already been extracted, to replace flour and soybean cake in the production of soy sauce. After testing by health authorities, it was proven that this type of soy sauce is completely hygienic, contains no toxins, and is rich in nutritional value. The umami flavor is also slightly increased compared to soy sauce made from flour and other ingredients. The cost of this soy sauce is also relatively low. Consumers were satisfied during trial sales.
    Based on the silkworm pupae production situation in Jiangsu Province, there are nearly two million catties of deoiled silkworm pupae. If all of it is used to make soy sauce, it can save the country a large amount of grain. Based on the production volume of Xintai Qia Sauce Factory this year, using silkworm pupae to make soy sauce can save more than 350,000 catties of flour and more than 47,000 catties of soybean cake.

    新泰洽酱油厂用蚕蛹制酱油
    江苏省工业厅在地方国营苏州新泰洽酱油厂试用已经提炼过蚕蛹油的蚕蛹代替面粉、豆饼等制造酱油成功。经卫生机关化验证明，这种酱油完全合乎卫生，毫无毒质，而且营养价值很丰富，所含鲜味比面粉等制的酱油还略有增加。这种酱油成本也比较低。在试销中，消费者感到满意。
    根据江苏省蚕蛹生产情况，约有脱油蚕蛹近二百万斤，如果全部用来制造酱油，可以为国家节约大量粮食。以新泰洽酱油厂今年生产量来计算，用蚕蛹来制造的酱油，就可以节约面粉三十五万多斤，豆饼四万七千多斤。　（本报驻南京记者）
