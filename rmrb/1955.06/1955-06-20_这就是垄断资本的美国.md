This is Monopoly Capital's America

Monopoly Capital Groups are Unwilling to See International Situation Ease

    Reports from newspapers connected with U.S. financial groups indicate that the prospect of easing international tensions is not to the liking of U.S. financial groups.

    These newspapers connected with financial groups, when talking about the possibility of holding a Four-Power conference, said that negotiations "will not produce any results," and that regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, the United States will continue to implement its massive military build-up plan.

    "The Wall Street Journal" said that Americans "should not be too naive" and should not expect the planned Four-Power summit to produce "miracles." This magazine said that the Four-Power high-level talks should be "preparatory" in nature, and as for "future talks," they "may be fruitless."

    Eliot Janeway, publisher of the economic publication "Eliot Janeway Comments" and a financial expert, is betting on stepping up the arms race. He said:

    “Arming Germany will first intensify international tensions...Germany should become a factor that can play a certain role in the world balance of power. That is to say, it should be armed. The government realizes this." He spoke unreservedly about his plans: the "corporate activities" of American arms manufacturers will develop upwards.

Violent Fluctuations in the New York Stock Market

    Recent developments in the international situation have caused violent fluctuations in the New York stock market.

    In the first half of May, when news of the agreement on the Austrian State Treaty and the brewing of a Four-Power Heads of Government conference came one after another, the New York stock market continued to decline. On May 14, the Four Foreign Ministers reached a general agreement on the issue of the Heads of Government conference, and on May 15, the Austrian State Treaty was signed. On May 16, the New York stock market experienced the second most violent price drop this year. In this price drop, the stocks of companies producing military aircraft, such as Boeing and Douglas, fell particularly sharply, down 35% from the highest price reached this year.

Plotting Further Persecution of Labor and Progressive Organizations

    U.S. Attorney General Brownell publicly announced that in the 1955-1956 fiscal year, he would further intensify the persecution of domestic labor and progressive organizations. In an annual report to U.S. President Eisenhower and Congress on the U.S. Department of Justice's persecution of domestic progressive activities on June 1, Brownell said that the U.S. Department of Justice intends to force approximately 30 organizations that are very active in the United States to register with the police as "Communist front organizations" under the so-called "Subversive Activities Control Act" in the next year. The Department of Justice also hopes to prove that several labor organizations have "Communist infiltration" in the next year.

    According to this "Control Act," registered groups must register their printing equipment with the U.S. government and submit their financial reports. Members of the groups will be deprived of the right to work in state agencies and private enterprises.

Racial Discrimination and Segregation in Schools

    Recently, American racists have been clamoring against the abolition of racial segregation in public schools. According to a United Press report on the 10th, five gubernatorial candidates in Mississippi successively issued statements at a conference, expressing their firm opposition to the abolition of racial segregation in public schools. Former Mississippi Governor Wright said that the Mississippi legislature and state authorities should take measures to consolidate the system in which black and white students are not allowed to attend school in the same place. He even said that "police force" should be used if necessary to assist in the struggle against the abolition of racial segregation.

    Mississippi's current governor, White, also said not long ago that he would rather close all public schools than allow black and white students to attend school together.

    Georgia Governor Griffin said that he would resolutely continue to implement racial segregation. Louisiana State Senator Linerk clamored to organize a "battle" against the abolition of racial segregation.

Obscene Books and Paintings and Violent Films Flood the Country

    Obscene books and paintings, and television programs and films depicting violence are increasingly rampant in the United States.

    U.S. Senator Kefauver said at a so-called "opinion hearing on yellow literature" organized by the Senate on May 31 that in the United States, the publication of obscene books and paintings has developed into a "huge business" that publishes 350 million copies annually, and is still developing. Kefauver said that recently, in American schools and other places where young people gather, the distribution of "yellow stuff" is very widespread. He said that due to the influence of these obscene books and paintings, the crime rate among American teenagers is increasing.

    American filmmakers are also producing a large number of films promoting violence. Movie advertisements in American newspapers are filled with content such as: "A terrifying scene of violence! Fighting and murder...the unbelievable complete record of a savage and inhuman crime!",

   "Mickey Spillane's latest hydrogen bomb!", "An amazing story about young middle school student hooligans!", "The terrifying impact of a story about living by killing..." etc.

On Average, One in Less Than 3,000 People is a Drug Addict

    U.S. Narcotics Commissioner Anslinger testified in the Senate on the 2nd that there are approximately 60,000 drug users in the United States. That is, on average, one in less than 3,000 people in the country is a drug addict. He said: There is ample evidence that drug addiction is a serious problem in the United States. Anslinger said that the figure of 60,000 does not include people who smoke marijuana. He said: Smoking marijuana has recently become an "increasingly serious problem." Marijuana is a specialty of the United States. Its leaves have narcotic properties and can be mixed with tobacco leaves and smoked after drying.

    According to a United Press report, drug addiction is much more prevalent among the U.S. Far East garrison than among American civilians. United Press quoted Senator Welker as saying: The proportion of drug addicts in the Far East garrison is "alarming." (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    这就是垄断资本的美国
    垄断资本集团不愿国际局势缓和
    同美国各财团有联系的报纸的报道表明，国际紧张局势缓和的前景是不合美国各财团的心意的。
    这些同各财团有联系的报纸在谈到召开四大国会议的可能性时说，谈判“不会产生任何结果”，不论谈判结果如何，美国将继续实行庞大的军备计划。
      “华尔街杂志”说，美国人“不应当太天真”，不要希望计划中的四大国会谈会产生“奇迹”。这家杂志说，四大国高级会谈应当是“预备”性质的，至于“以后的会谈”，那“可能是没有结果的”。
    经济刊物“伊利奥特·詹威评论”的出版者、金融专家詹威把赌注压在加紧扩充军备上。他说：
  “武装德国首先会加剧国际紧张局势……德国应当在世界力量对比中成为一个能起一定作用的因素。这就是说，它应当武装起来。政府认识到了这一点。”他毫不掩饰地谈到他的打算：美国军火制造商的“企业活动”将向上发展。
    纽约股票市场的激烈波动
    最近国际事态的发展在纽约股票市场上引起了一场激烈的波动。
    在五月上半个月，奥地利国家条约获致协议、酝酿举行四大国政府首脑会议的消息接连传出的时候，纽约股票行情一直不断下跌。五月十四日，四国外长就政府首脑会议问题达成一般协议，十五日，奥地利国家条约签字，十六日，纽约股票市场上就发生了今年以来第二次最猛烈的跌价。在这次跌价中，跌得特别厉害的是波音、道格拉斯等出产军用飞机的公司的股票，比今年所曾达到的最高价格下跌了百分之三十五。
    策划进一步迫害劳工和进步组织
    美国司法部长布朗纳尔公开宣布，在一九五五到一九五六财政年度内，要进一步加紧迫害国内劳工和进步组织。布朗纳尔六月一日在给美国总统艾森豪威尔和国会的一份关于美国司法部迫害国内进步活动的情况的年度报告中说，美国司法部打算在下一年度内根据所谓“颠覆活动管制法”，强迫约三十个在美国很活跃的组织向警察机关登记为“共产党外围组织”，司法部还希望在下一年度内证明好些劳工组织有“共产党的渗入”。
    根据这一“管制法”，接受登记的团体必须向美国政府登记它们的印刷设备，提出它们的财政报告。团体的成员将被剥夺了在国家机关中和私人企业中工作的权利。
    学校中的种族歧视和隔离
    最近美国种族主义者正在叫嚷反对取消公立学校中的种族隔离。据合众社十日报道，美国密士失必州的五个州长候选人在一次会议上先后发表声明，表示他们坚决反对取消公立学校中的种族隔离制度。密士失必州前任州长怀莱特说，密士失必州的立法议会和州当局应该采取措施来巩固黑人学生和白人学生不得在同一个地方上学的制度，他甚至说，在必要时应该采用“警察力量”来协助反对取消种族隔离的斗争。
    密士失必州的现任州长怀特不久以前也说，他宁愿把一切公立学校关闭，也不让黑人学生和白人学生一同上学。
    佐治亚州州长格里芬说，他要坚决继续实行种族隔离。路易斯安那州州参议员莱纳克叫嚷要组织反对取消种族隔离的“战斗”。
    淫秽书画和暴行影片泛滥全国
    美国的淫秽书画、描绘暴行的电视节目和影片越来越泛滥。
    美国参议员克弗维尔五月三十一日在参议院组织的一次所谓“关于黄色文学的意见听取会”上说，目前在美国，出版淫书淫画已经发展成为每年出版三亿五千万本的“巨大事业”，并且还在继续发展中。克弗维尔说，最近在美国学校和其他少年聚集的地方，“黄色东西”的散布量很广。他说，由于这些淫书淫画的影响，美国少年的犯罪率正在增加。
    美国制片商也正大量摄制着宣扬暴行的影片。美国报纸的电影广告中充斥着这样一些内容：“一种骇人的暴行场面！打架和谋杀……关于一种野蛮无人性的犯罪事件的不能令人相信的全部纪录！”，
  “米开·斯皮兰的最新氢弹！”，“关于年轻中学生流氓的一个惊人故事！”，“靠杀人过活的故事所产生的可怕影响……”等。
  平均不到三千人就有一人吸毒
    美国麻醉品局局长安斯林格二日在参议院作证时说，美国大约有六万人吸用毒品。就是全国平均每不到三千人有一人吸毒。他说：有充分证据证明，吸毒在美国是一个严重问题。安斯林格说，这个六万人的数字还不包括吸北美大麻的人。他说：吸大麻最近几年来已成为“越来越严重的问题”。北美大麻是美国的一种特产，它的叶子有麻醉性，晒干后可以同烟叶混合吸。
    据合众社报道，吸毒在美国远东驻军中间比美国的平民中间更流行得多。合众社引用参议员威尔克的话说：远东驻军中吸毒人数的比例是“令人吃惊的”。　（据新华社讯）
