Don't Be Afraid of Trouble When Rectifying Agricultural Cooperatives
　　Zeng Zhiqiang
　　The purpose of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives is to truly establish them on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis, so that both internal and external production work can be done better. The rectification process should be a process of raising the masses' awareness and handling various specific issues. To rectify for the sake of rectification, treating the rectification work itself as the goal of rectification, as a crash task, will not do the job well.
　　The first agricultural production cooperative in Dingxin Township, Anyue County, Sichuan Province, was established before the autumn of last year and carried out rectification and consolidation work during this year's spring plowing. They divided the work into two steps: first, dealing with issues such as plowing cattle, manure prices, investment, and setting production plans. There were three cattle in the cooperative whose depreciated prices were too low and should be adjusted. However, some of the key members of the cooperative were afraid of trouble, afraid that "touching the melon vine would cause movement," and dared not earnestly implement the principle of mutual benefit. They only casually mentioned at the members' meeting that "the cattle prices that were depreciated low in the past should be appropriately adjusted"; however, they did not explain in detail why the adjustment was necessary, what benefits the adjustment would bring to the entire cooperative, and to each member. Some members who needed to make supplementary payments were ideologically resistant and said they were unwilling to adjust. This suited the wishes of the key members, and they did not insist on the adjustment. In this way, the owners of these three cattle who wanted to adjust were embarrassed to speak up. Regarding the adjustment of pig manure prices, they only discussed the method and did not resolve the specific issues; the investment issues were also not dealt with. When setting production plans, only the key members discussed them, and the members were not asked to discuss them at all; they only investigated the yield of each household's land last year and proposed a production increase target; but there were no concrete measures to guarantee the realization of this target; many members did not even know the production increase target. The second step was to implement a contract labor system. The head of the cooperative and others simply calculated the total land of the cooperative, estimated the amount of work that needed to be done from now until the autumn harvest, gathered it together, and divided it among the teams according to their labor force, which was considered "contracting it out." It was never discussed by the members, and the team leaders could not arrange work, not knowing exactly what to do or how to do it; even some management committee members didn't know.
　　The rectification work lasted for twenty-two days, and the result was just holding many meetings (there were four full-day meetings during the day, seven half-day meetings during the day, and almost every night there were meetings), but no problems within the cooperative were solved, no enthusiasm was raised among the members, and only burdens were increased for the key members and the masses of members. Management Committee member Xiao Guanglun said: "Meeting like this one day and meeting like that another day, no problems are solved, it's better to pick up a few pounds of manure or cut a few pounds of grass to increase some fertilizer!"
　　The main reason for this phenomenon is that the cooperative staff did not truly recognize the necessity of rectification. They were afraid of "too much movement," and as a result, what should be "moved" was not "moved," and what was unreasonable was not changed, hoping to minimize "trouble" and maintain "peace and tranquility." In reality, since the problems have not been solved, it is impossible to maintain "peace and tranquility," and there will definitely be more "trouble" in the future.
　　Another reason for this phenomenon is that the rectification work was seen as the business of the cooperative staff and a few key members, and the masses were not mobilized or relied upon. Doing so naturally makes it impossible to solve the various specific problems well, nor can it raise the awareness of the masses, nor can it achieve the purpose of rectification.

    整顿农业合作社不要怕麻烦
    曾志强
    整顿农业生产合作社的目的，是把农业合作社确实建立在自愿互利的基础上，使社内社外的生产工作都能做得更好。整顿的过程，应当是提高群众觉悟和处理各项具体问题的过程。为整顿而整顿，把整顿工作本身当成整顿的目的，当作一项突击任务来做，是不可能做好这个工作的。
    四川安岳县鼎新乡第一农业生产合作社是去年秋前建立的，在今年春耕生产中进行了整顿巩固工作。他们是把工作分做两步来做的：第一步，处理耕牛、粪价、投资等问题和订生产计划。社内有三头牛折价偏低、应该调整。可是，社内的一些骨干分子怕麻烦，怕“碰了藤藤瓜要动”，就不敢认真地贯彻互利原则。他们只在社员会上随便提了一下“过去牛价折得低的要适当调整”；但是，为什么要调整，调整了对全社、对各个社员有什么好处，都不详细讲解。一部分需要补款的社员思想不通，就提出不愿意调整。这正合了骨干分子的心愿，他们也就不坚持要调整了。这样，这三头牛的牛主想要调整，也不好说出口了。对于调整猪粪价格，只是讨论了一下办法，并没有解决具体问题；对于投资问题，也没有处理。在订生产计划时，只是骨干分子讨论了一下，根本没叫社员们讨论；他们只把去年各户田土产量摸了一下底，提出了一个增产指标；怎样保证实现呢？具体办法一条也没有；许多社员连增产指标也不知道。第二步是实行包工制。只是由社长等人把全社的田土算了一下，从现在到秋收大致需要做多少活路，汇集起来，按各队劳力分到各队，就算是“包下去”了，根本没经社员讨论过，队长也没法排工，不晓得究竟做什么，怎样做；甚至有些管理委员也不知道。
    整顿工作做了二十二天，结果只是开了许多会（有四个白天开了整天的会，七个白天开了半天会，晚上几乎每晚都开会）却没有解决社内的任何问题，没有提高社员们的积极性，只是给社内骨干和社员群众增加了负担。管理委员肖光伦说：“一天这样会，那样会，啥子问题也不解决，还不如捡几斤粪、割几斤草增加点肥料哩！”
    发生这种现象的主要原因，是办社工作人员没有真正认识到整顿的必要性。他们唯恐“多动”，结果应该“动”的也不“动”，不合理的也不改变，希望尽可能减少“麻烦”，“相安无事”。实际上，问题既然没有解决，是决不可能“相安无事”的，以后一定会有更多的“麻烦”。
    发生这种现象的又一个原因，是把整顿工作看成了办社工作人员和少数骨干分子的事，没有发动群众和依靠群众。这样做，自然不可能很好地解决各项具体问题，也不能提高群众的觉悟，不能达到整顿的目的。
