    Wuhan City's Pre-Flood Embankment Construction Project Completed

    Wuhan City’s pre-flood embankment construction project for this year has been basically completed. All embankments have reached the designed elevation, averaging about one meter higher than the highest water level of 29.73 meters in 1954. The entire pre-flood project used more than 8 million cubic meters of earth, stone, and concrete. The main embankments of Wuhan City—Zhanggong Embankment and Wuqing Embankment—have been widened to twice their original size. New embankments have also been built in areas that previously had no embankments. In the Danshuichi area of Hankou, factories and warehouses were located outside the old embankment and were flooded during the 1954 flood season. This year, more than 3,000 meters of modern, reinforced concrete waterproof walls have been built around these factories and warehouses to ensure their safety. In the Hanyang urban area, where there were originally no embankment sections, lifeline embankments have been fully constructed this year. Stone pitching revetments and dry-laid stone block slope protection projects have also been carried out in areas facing the flow head-on and with large wind and waves. All dangerous sections from the 1954 flood season have been reinforced and rebuilt this year. The completion of these projects will play a significant role in protecting the production and construction, as well as the safety of the people's lives, in the Wuhan area.

    Currently, the Yangtze River flood season has arrived, and Wuhan City is actively carrying out flood prevention preparations. (Ni Lingyun)

    武汉市汛前堤防建设工程完工
    武汉市今年汛前的堤防建设工程已基本完工。全部堤防都达到设计标高，平均都比一九五四年最高水位二十九点七三公尺高出一公尺左右。全部汛前工程共用了土方、石方和混凝土八百多万立公方。武汉市的主要干堤——张公堤和武青堤都比旧堤加宽了一倍。原无堤防的地段也建了新的堤防。汉口丹水池原有工厂和仓库在旧堤防外，一九五四年汛期曾受到水淹，今年就在这些工厂和仓库的外围修建了三千多公尺长的钢筋混凝土的现代化的防水墙，保障这些工厂的安全。汉阳市区原无堤段的地方今年全部兴修了确保线堤防，在迎流顶冲和风浪较大的地方也都做了抛石护岸和干砌块石坦坡护岸工程。一九五四年汛期中的所有险工段，今年都作了加固改建。这些工程的完成对保卫武汉地区的生产建设和人民生命的安全将起很大作用。
    目前长江汛期已到，武汉市正积极进行防汛准备工作。　（倪凌云）
