    The Soviet Note to the West German Government Arouses Widespread Attention; Berlin Democratic Newspapers Give Prominent Coverage
    Berlin democratic newspapers prominently published the news of the Soviet government's note to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the front pages on the 8th. "Neues Deutschland" and "Berliner Zeitung" were headlined: "Adenauer Invited to Moscow." "Tribüne" was headlined: "Soviet Government Note to the Government of the Federal Republic." "National-Zeitung" was headlined: "Soviet Government Suggests Adenauer Go to Moscow." The news published by the newspapers emphasized: The interests of peace and European security, as well as the national interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Germany, require the establishment of normal relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.
    West German Political and Newspaper Circles Welcome the Note
    According to a report by the German News Agency in West Germany, Federal Parliament Vice President Schmidt said that the Soviet government's note was "a major event." Minister for Senate Affairs, Meikartz, said that the Soviet invitation should be carefully studied.
    German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer said that the Soviet invitation should be viewed in light of the recent Soviet political actions in Europe, which aimed to promote negotiations on current issues. Ollenhauer said: "The Federal Government's attitude towards the Moscow invitation will clearly show whether the Federal Government is truly willing to negotiate with the Soviet Union on the restoration of German unity." Ollenhauer stated: The Social Democratic Party demands that the Moscow invitation be accepted, and advocates that the first item on the agenda of the Moscow talks should be the issue of German unity.
    Federal Parliament President Gerstenmaier said: "I think the suggestion to send an ambassador to Moscow should be accepted." German Free Democratic Party parliamentarian Swan and German Social Democratic Party parliamentarian Altmeier also firmly advocated accepting the Soviet invitation.
    The Soviet government's note to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany became the focus of attention for all newspapers in West Berlin on the 8th.
    According to the "Der Tagesspiegel," those around Chancellor Adenauer emphasized that the West German government would not take steps without consulting with Western countries. They also pointed out that Adenauer would go to the United States on June 11 as originally planned. The newspaper then said: The Federal Government, in principle, believes that it is willing to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.
    Reactions in London Diplomatic Circles to the Soviet Note
    A British Foreign Office spokesman refused to comment on the news of the Soviet invitation to West German Chancellor Adenauer to visit Moscow recently on the evening of the 7th.
    Agence France-Presse quoted diplomatic observers in London as saying that the Soviet note to West Germany "caused great consternation" and a certain degree of unease in London.
    An Associated Press reporter in London reported: "The initial reaction of Western diplomats to Moscow's invitation to West German Chancellor Adenauer can be summarized as the belief that the Bonn government will find it difficult to reject the Soviet proposal to normalize relations between the two countries. These diplomats pointed out that Germans with nationalist sentiments in various political parties have long exerted strong pressure on Chancellor Adenauer's government, demanding that Adenauer play a greater independent role in international affairs." The Associated Press reporter continued, officials said that Chancellor Adenauer "is free to go to Moscow if he wishes to." They apparently hoped that the West German Chancellor would first consult with the Western powers in accordance with the unified policy formulated by the West.
    Paris Newspapers Emphasize the Impact of the Soviet Note
    Paris newspapers published news about the Soviet government's note to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the front pages on the 8th with large headlines. This note has aroused countless reactions and comments.
    "L'Humanité" welcomed this action by the Soviet Union, which has great significance for consolidating world peace. It pointed out that Soviet diplomacy has always been faithful to the principles of non-interference and peaceful coexistence. It said: "If the Soviet Union's new proposal is accepted, it will pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the German issue and ease international tensions."
    Reports in some right-wing newspapers revealed their concern that the Soviet Union's initiative to consolidate peace would have an impact on the overall international situation. These newspapers believe that Soviet foreign policy has taken the initiative.
    Senator Debre wrote in "Combat" that the active actions of Soviet diplomacy "may create a very widespread reaction in public opinion."
    Commentators in some bourgeois newspapers are particularly afraid that the development of normal relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will help resolve all outstanding issues related to Germany, thereby helping to restore Germany's democratic unity. Therefore, right-wing newspapers, which were still advocating that West Germany "restore its sovereignty" yesterday, today resolutely reminded Adenauer that the Paris Accords placed the government of the Federal Republic of Germany in a subordinate position to Western countries, and required that every step it took be agreed upon in advance with Washington, London, and Paris. But at the same time, some newspapers had to admit that Chancellor Adenauer could not refuse the proposals in the Soviet note. "Combat" said: "Refusing the invitation would isolate the Chancellor even further, and even cause divisions with some of his supporters."
    Anxious and Negative Reactions in Washington
    From the tone of American newspaper commentators, it can be seen that the Soviet note, aimed at establishing normal relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, has aroused anxious and negative reactions among officials in Washington. For example, observer Reston published an article in "The New York Times" attempting to portray the Soviet note as a step taken "to detach Adenauer from his Western allies." Reston expressed obvious unease that the Soviet note might "persuade Germans before the Big Four Conference that Germany would benefit more politically and economically if it did not join the Western alliance"; The Soviet note would also make them believe that West Germany "would benefit more from developing trade with the communist world by using its industry and manpower, rather than joining the anti-Soviet bloc and using its strength and industry for arms production."
    Reston pointed out: "No German politician, not even Adenauer, can refuse the Soviet proposal without serious consideration."

### 苏联给西德政府的照会引起各国广泛重视  柏林民主报纸都予显著刊载

    苏联给西德政府的照会引起各国广泛重视
    柏林民主报纸都予显著刊载
    柏林各民主报纸八日都在首页以大标题刊载了苏联政府照会德意志联邦共和国政府的消息。“新德意志报”和“柏林日报”的标题是：“阿登纳被邀请到莫斯科去”。“论坛报”的标题是：“苏联政府照会联邦共和国政府”。“国民日报”的标题是：“苏联政府建议阿登纳去莫斯科”。各报刊载的消息着重指出：和平和欧洲安全的利益以及苏联和德国两国人民的民族利益要求在苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间建立正常关系。
    西德政界和报纸表示欢迎
    据西德的德意志新闻社报道，联邦议院副主席施密特说，苏联政府的照会是“一件大事”。负责参议院事务的部长麦卡兹说，苏联的邀请应当仔细研究。
    德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔说，应当从最近苏联在欧洲的政治行动来看苏联的这次邀请，这些政治行动的目的在于促成就当前问题举行谈判。奥伦豪尔说：“联邦政府对莫斯科的邀请的态度将明显地表明：联邦政府是否真正愿意也同苏联进行关于恢复德国统一的谈判。”奥伦豪尔表示：社会民主党要求接受莫斯科的邀请，并且主张莫斯科会谈的第一项议程应当是有关德国统一的问题。
    联邦议院主席格斯登美尔说：“我认为，关于派遣驻莫斯科大使的建议是应当接受的。”德国自由民主党议员斯万和德国社会民主党议员阿尔特麦尔也坚决主张接受苏联邀请。
    苏联政府致德意志联邦共和国政府的照会成为八日西柏林所有报纸注意的中心。
    据“每日镜报”报道，阿登纳总理周围的人着重指出：西德政府在没有同西方国家商量以前不会采取步骤。他们还指出：阿登纳要在六月十一日按照原计划到美国去。这家报纸接着说：联邦政府在原则上认为，它愿意同苏联建立外交关系。
    伦敦外交界对苏联照会的反应
    英国外交部发言人在七日晚拒绝评论苏联邀请西德总理阿登纳在最近访问莫斯科的消息。
    法新社援引伦敦的外交观察员的话说，苏联给西德的照会“在伦敦引起了极大的慌乱”和某种程度的不安。
    美联社驻伦敦记者报道：“西方外交人士对莫斯科向西德总理阿登纳提出的邀请的第一个反应，可以归纳为这样一种看法：波恩政府很难拒绝苏联关于两国关系正常化的建议。这些外交人士指出：各政党中有民族主义情绪的德国人早就对阿登纳总理的政府施行强大的压力，要求阿登纳在国际事务中起更大的独立作用。”美联社记者接着说，官方人士说，阿登纳总理“可以自由地到莫斯科去，如果他愿意去的话”。他们显然希望：西德总理首先按照西方所制定的统一政策同西方大国磋商。
    巴黎报纸重视苏联照会的影响
    巴黎报纸八日在首页以大栏的标题刊载了关于苏联政府给德意志联邦共和国政府的照会的消息。这个照会引起无数反应和评论。
    “人道报”欢迎苏联这个对巩固世界和平有巨大意义的行动。它指出：苏联外交始终忠实于不干涉和和平共处的原则。它说：“苏联的新建议如果被接受了，就会为和平解决德国问题铺平道路，使国际紧张局势得到缓和。”
    若干右翼报纸的报道透露出它们担心苏联的巩固和平的倡议会在整个国际局势中产生影响。这些报纸认为苏联外交政策掌握了主动权。
    参议员德布雷在“战斗报”上写道，苏联外交的积极行动“可能在舆论中造成十分普遍的反应。”
    某些资产阶级报纸的评论员尤其害怕苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间正常关系的发展会有助于解决有关德国的一切悬而未决的问题，从而有助于恢复德国的民主统一。因此，昨天还在鼓吹使西德“恢复主权”的右派报纸，今天却坚决提醒阿登纳注意：巴黎协定使德意志联邦共和国政府处于从属于西方国家的地位，并且要求它的每一个步骤都要预先同华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎取得一致。但是同时，一些报纸也不得不承认阿登纳总理无法拒绝苏联照会中的建议。“战斗报”说：“拒绝邀请就会使总理更深地陷于孤立，甚至同某些拥护他的人发生分裂。”
  在华盛顿引起不安和否定的反应
    从美国报纸评论员的腔调中可以看出：以建立苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的正常关系为目的的苏联照会在华盛顿官方人士中引起了不安和否定的反应。例如，观察家赖斯顿在“纽约时报”上发表了一篇文章，企图把苏联照会说成是“为了使阿登纳脱离西方盟国”而采取的步骤。赖斯顿明显地表示不安说，苏联照会可能“在四大国会议之前使德国人相信：德国如果不参加西方同盟，它在政治和经济方面所得到的好处就会更多”；苏联照会还会使他们相信：西德“利用自己的工业和人力来同共产主义世界发展贸易，比参加反苏集团和把自己的力量和工业用于军火生产更加有利”。
    赖斯顿指出：“没有一个德国政治家，连阿登纳在内，能够不认真研究就拒绝苏联的建议”。
