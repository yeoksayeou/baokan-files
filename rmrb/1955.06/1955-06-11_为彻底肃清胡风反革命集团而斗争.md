    Struggle to Thoroughly Eliminate the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
    Li Jishen
    The three batches of materials concerning the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published successively in the "People's Daily" fully prove that the Hu Feng clique is a counter-revolutionary conspiracy organization that endangers the country and the people, through and through. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a loyal lackey of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, consistently carrying out the orders of their masters, using the most insidious and vicious means to undermine the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. I feel boundless anger at the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's criminal activities and resolutely advocate that severe sanctions be imposed on Hu Feng and the unrepentant elements in his clique.
    For more than twenty years, the Hu Feng clique has been wearing the cloak of Marxism, using the guise of engaging in literary and artistic work, infiltrating the ranks of the people's revolution, and implementing so-called "heart-digging warfare," attempting to destroy the revolutionary fortress from within. He exhausted all his efforts to overthrow the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, thereby achieving his criminal goal of subverting the People's Republic of China and enabling the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to restore its rule on the mainland. Because the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng also knew that the Chinese Communist Party is the leading core of the Chinese people's revolution and the fundamental guarantee of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. However, the hideous face of the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng, after being hidden for more than twenty years, was still thoroughly exposed. This shows that no matter how cleverly any counter-revolutionary elements hide themselves, they can never deceive the sharp eyes of the people and escape the giant hand of the people. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident is a major victory for the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in their struggle against enemies at home and abroad!
    The Hu Feng incident has made us further realize the complexity and acuteness of the class struggle during the transition period. Enemies at home and abroad will try every possible means to undermine our people's revolutionary cause in open and covert ways. And hidden enemies like Hu Feng are even more insidious and terrifying than open enemies. I call on all members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to be vigilant at all times, strictly distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, continue to actively participate in the struggle to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, expose the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique from all aspects, and strictly guard against counter-revolutionary elements infiltrating the internal organizations of our Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. We must contribute all our strength and, together with the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, fight to thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and smash all the conspiracies and tricks of enemies at home and abroad.

    为彻底肃清胡风反革命集团而斗争
    李济深
    “人民日报”前后发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，完全证明胡风集团是一个危害国家、危害人民、彻头彻尾的反革命阴谋组织；胡风反革命集团是帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的忠实走狗，一贯地奉行着他们主子的旨意，以最阴险毒辣的手段来破坏中国人民的革命事业。我对胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动感到无比的愤怒，坚决主张要给胡风及其集团中的执迷不悟的分子以严厉的制裁。
    胡风集团二十多年来一直披着马克思主义的外衣，打着搞文艺工作的幌子，混入人民革命队伍，实行所谓“挖心战”，妄图从内部来破坏革命的堡垒。他用尽一切心机要推翻中国共产党的领导，从而达到他颠覆中华人民共和国，使蒋介石匪帮在大陆复辟的罪恶目的；因为反革命分子胡风也知道，中国共产党是中国人民革命的领导核心，是中国人民革命胜利的根本保证。但胡风反革命的狰狞面目，隐藏了二十多年之后，还是被彻底地暴露出来了，这就说明任何反革命分子无论他隐藏得如何巧妙，总归是瞒不过人民雪亮的眼睛，逃不出人民的巨掌的。胡风反革命集团事件的揭发，是中国人民在中国共产党领导下、进行反对内外敌人斗争中的一个重大胜利！
    胡风事件使我们进一步认识到过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性，内外敌人是要千方百计采取公开和隐蔽的方式来破坏我们人民革命事业的，而像胡风这种隐蔽的敌人是比公开的敌人还更加阴险，更加可怕的。我号召中国国民党革命委员会全体成员，必须随时提高警惕，严格划清敌我界限，继续积极参加粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争，从各方面揭露胡风反革命集团的罪恶，并严防反革命分子混入我们中国国民党革命委员会组织的内部。我们要贡献一切力量，和全国人民一道，在中国共产党的英明领导下，为彻底肃清胡风反革命集团、粉碎内外敌人的一切阴谋诡计而斗争。
