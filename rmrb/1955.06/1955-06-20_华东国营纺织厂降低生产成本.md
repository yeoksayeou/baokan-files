East China Textile Administration: Due to the implementation of various conservation measures, the thirty-five state-owned textile factories under the East China Textile Administration have reduced actual production costs by 1.76% from January to May this year compared to the plan. The cost reduction from cotton textile factories alone amounted to more than 3.45 million yuan. From January to May, the total profit exceeding the planned target for all factories was 1.89 million yuan.

While striving to conserve and reduce costs, all factories have paid attention to ensuring product quality. In May, despite the high impurity and moisture content of the cotton used by the cotton textile factories, they adopted many technical measures, and five factories produced yarn that was entirely first-grade, first-class quality.

In recent months, dyeing and printing factories have also made many efforts to conserve caustic soda, find substitutes for expensive dyes, and conserve grain. For example, the three dyeing and printing factories with printing departments have universally adopted "sodium silicate" paste to replace grain as a color paste material, saving 6,000 jin of grain per month. In the past, factories did not pay much attention to conserving electricity. This year, all factories have implemented stricter control over electricity consumption, stipulating the electricity consumption per yarn, per bolt of cloth, and per type of work. From January to May, a total of 6.35 million kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华东国营纺织厂降低生产成本
    华东纺织管理局所属的三十五个国营纺织厂，由于多方面实行节约，今年一到五月份实际生产成本比计划降低了百分之一点七六。其中只是棉纺织厂成本降低的金额，就有三百四十五万多元。一到五月份各厂超计划利润共一百八十九万元。
    各厂在努力节约、降低成本的同时，都注意保证产品质量。五月份各棉纺织厂在用棉含杂质多、水份高的情况下，采取了许多技术措施，有五个厂生产的纱全部是一等一级品。
    各印染厂几个月来在节约烧碱、寻找贵重染料的代用品、节约粮食等方面也作了很多努力。如三个有印花部门的印染厂普遍采用“矽酸钠”浆代替粮食做色浆料后，每个月就节约粮食六千斤。过去各厂不大重视节约用电，今年各厂对用电量进行了更严格的控制，规定了每件纱、每匹布和每类工种的用电量，从一月份到五月份，共节约了六百三十五万度电。　（新华社）
