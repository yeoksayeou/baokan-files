　　Moscow dispatch from our newspaper, June 13th—The Soviet "Pravda" published nearly half a page on June 13th with a report from its Beijing correspondent on the Chinese people's exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. This report comprehensively narrates the struggle of the Chinese people against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and introduces in detail the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the People's Daily on the 10th, as well as the People's Daily editorial on the 10th. The "Pravda" reporter's report stated: "The merit of exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique belongs to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The People's Daily, the organ of the CCP Central Committee, played a significant role in exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. For several months, the newspaper thoroughly and step-by-step exposed the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and its ringleaders, and used its sharp, highly principled commentary to raise the revolutionary vigilance of the broad masses of the people, and called upon them to conduct a tireless struggle against the enemies of the Chinese people."
