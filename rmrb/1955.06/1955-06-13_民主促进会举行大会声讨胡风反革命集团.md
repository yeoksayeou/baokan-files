Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: The China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) headquarters convened a meeting on the 11th, gathering over 100 people, including central council members in Beijing, heads of various departments of the headquarters, committee members, group members, and representatives from local organizations across the country who were in Beijing to attend a national work report meeting. The purpose was to once again denounce the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng clique.

	Ma Xulun, Chairman of the CAPD, stated at the meeting that the true face of the Hu Feng clique has now been completely exposed. The evidence is irrefutable, proving it to be an organization indistinguishable from any spy or secret agent organization, except that their conspiratorial destructive activities are even more insidious and vicious. Comrades of the CAPD should fully learn from the Hu Feng incident. We must rely even more closely on the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen the unity within the people's democratic united front, enhance our political responsibility and political vigilance, and not allow any counter-revolutionary schemers to exploit any vulnerabilities.

	Zhou Jianren, Vice Chairman of the CAPD, Xu Guangping, Secretary-General, Zhao Puchu, Jin Zhixuan, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee Wu Yan Yin, Fu Binran, and representatives from local organizations in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangxi, Nanjing, Shaanxi, etc., including Shen Huiru, Si Xiaonan, Ji Keming, Zhou Zhiqin, Shi Quan, Zhu Naiwen, Yang Mingshu, and others, all spoke enthusiastically at the meeting, expressing boundless anger at the crimes of the Hu Feng clique. Everyone unanimously agreed that the Hu Feng clique is the most insidious counter-revolutionary enemy, and their aim is to subvert the people's revolutionary regime and allow Chiang Kai-shek to restore his rule. Speakers unanimously expressed their determination to overcome the erroneous thinking of not caring about this serious class struggle and to heighten revolutionary vigilance.

	The conference finally unanimously adopted a resolution denouncing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, demanding the complete smashing of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and severely punishing them according to the law. It also called on its members to fully learn from the lessons, enhance their political acumen, learn to be good at identifying counter-revolutionary elements, and thoroughly cleanse all hidden counter-revolutionary elements from the ranks of the people.

    民主促进会举行大会声讨胡风反革命集团
    新华社十二日讯　中国民主促进会总部十一日邀集在京中央理事、总部各部门负责人、委员、组员等及在京参加全国工作汇报会的各地方组织代表共一百多人举行大会，再次声讨胡风集团反党反人民反革命的罪行。
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦在会上说，现在胡风集团的真面目已经完全揭露了，铁证如山，它是和一切间谍特务组织丝毫没有区别的组织，只是它们的阴谋破坏活动更为毒辣、凶恶。中国民主促进会的同志，应该充分从胡风事件中吸取教训，我们必须更加靠拢中国共产党，加强人民民主统一战线内部的团结，提高政治责任感和政治警惕性，不让任何反革命阴谋分子钻空子。
    中国民主促进会副主席周建人、秘书长许广平、在京中央理事赵朴初、金芝轩、文教委员会副主任委员吴研因、傅彬然及上海、北京、广州、杭州、天津、沈阳、武汉、广西、南京、陕西等地方组织的代表沈慧儒、司晓南、计克敏、周之芹、石泉、朱乃文、杨明书等都在会上踊跃发言，对胡风集团的罪行表示无比愤怒。大家一致认为胡风集团是最阴险的反革命敌人，他们的目的就在于颠覆人民革命政权，让蒋介石复辟。发言者一致表示要克服不关心这一严重的阶级斗争的错误思想，提高革命警惕性。
    大会最后一致通过了声讨胡风反革命集团的决议，要求彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，依法予以严惩，并号召所属成员充分吸取教训，提高政治嗅觉，学会善于辨识反革命分子的本领，把一切暗藏的反革命分子从人民队伍中彻底清洗出去。
