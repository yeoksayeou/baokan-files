To the Editor:

    More than 163,000 jin of rice bran from a grain processing factory in Qiqihar were completely blown away by the wind in the first quarter of this year. Calculated at a unit price of 5 jiao per 100 jin, the total loss amounted to more than 800 yuan. These 163,000 jin of rice bran were not blown away by the wind in just a few days, but were blown away little by little each day. Residents around the factory have never bought rice bran, yet each household has several to a dozen bags of it. What is the reason? The factory's warehouse can only hold about 280 tons of rice bran at most, but they are currently storing 500 tons, which means that a large amount of rice bran can only be placed in the open air. The person in charge of the processing plant regards the work of handling by-products as incidental and does not pay attention to it, so that a large amount of rice bran is slowly blown away by the wind. We believe that this is an irresponsible act towards state property, and the relevant leaders should conduct an inspection and take action.

### 十六万斤谷糠被风刮跑了

    十六万斤谷糠被风刮跑了编辑同志：
    齐齐哈尔有一个粮食加工厂的十六万三千多斤谷糠在今年第一季度中完全被风吹走了。按照每百斤单价五角计算，共计损失八百多元。这十六万三千斤谷糠并不是几天之内就会被风吹跑的，而是一天一天被吹走的。厂子周围的一带住户，从来也没有买过一次谷糠，然而，每家都有几麻袋到十几麻袋的谷糠。什么原因呢？这个工厂的仓库，最多只能容纳谷糠二百八十吨左右，而现在他们却保管了五百吨，致使大批的谷糠只能放在露天里。加工厂负责人把处理副产品工作看成是附带工作，不去管它，以致大批谷糠就慢慢地被风吹跑了。我们认为这是一种对国家资财不负责任的行为，有关领导方面应该进行检查和处理。齐齐哈尔市粮食局　张永兰
