    The State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a notice on June 7 to all ministries, commissions, and people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government regarding matters related to the application of on-the-job cadres of state organs for higher education institutions in 1955, stipulating that state organs at all levels should continue to send a group of qualified on-the-job cadres to apply for higher education institutions this year.

    The notice stated that admitting qualified young on-the-job cadres into higher education institutions is not only a feasible way to increase the source of new students in higher education institutions, but also an important way to cultivate and improve cadres and enhance the quality of cadres for national construction. Applying for higher education institutions by on-the-job cadres of state organs should be based on the principle of voluntariness. All organs should provide active support and enthusiastic assistance to cadres who meet the requirements to apply for higher education institutions.

    The conditions that on-the-job cadres of state organs applying for higher education institutions should meet are: (1) a clear history; (2) good health, capable of persisting in long-term study; (3) graduation from senior high school or equivalent education; (4) generally under the age of 30, the age for applying for specialized courses in political science, law, and finance can be relaxed to 35. At the request of the cadre, each organ should issue a certificate with a spirit of active support and practical responsibility, and should not adopt incorrect attitudes to introduce those who do not meet the above conditions to apply for higher education institutions.

    The notice pointed out that before the examination, each organ should give the cadres who apply the necessary time to review their lessons, prepare for the examination, and other necessary assistance. On-the-job cadres of state organs who apply for higher education institutions but are not admitted shall all return to their original organs for work assignments. The original organs should not discriminate against them, let alone refuse to take care of them. On-the-job cadres of state organs who are admitted to school should, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education, enjoy the student grants for transferred cadres if they have participated in revolutionary work for three full years.
