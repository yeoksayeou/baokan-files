    Our Great Motherland
    The newly built Litang-Zhanjiang Railway, which starts from Litang Station in Guangxi Province, passes through the Guidong Plain, and reaches Zhanjiang Port on the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong Province, has been completed after eight months of intensive construction and will be officially opened to traffic on "July 1st". The completion of this railway not only provides favorable conditions for consolidating our national defense and liberating Taiwan, but also enlivens our foreign trade. This is a scene of bridge girder erection on the Nanliu River.
