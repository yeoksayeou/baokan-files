    Peaceful "Voice of Friendship"
    ——Talking about Indian Songs, Dances and Instrumental Music
    Yang Yinliu, Deputy Director of the Institute of National Music, Central Conservatory of Music

    The performance of the Indian Cultural Delegation in China is a major event in the cultural history of China and India. In our history, from the first century AD during the Han Dynasty to the early tenth century at the end of the Tang Dynasty, the mutual learning, mutual influence, mutual nourishment, and mutual promotion of the two countries in all aspects of culture, coupled with the economic development of China at that time, created a brilliant cultural development climax in Chinese history; the subsequent continued integration also became an important factor in the cultural development of both countries. Today, we have new conditions to promote our harmonious and profound friendship of two thousand years. The performances of the Indian Cultural Delegation have given us a clearer understanding of the past musical history; we are increasingly fond of Indian music and dance.

    From the perspective of Chinese music history research alone, the initial gains we have made in understanding are already significant. The performances of the Indian experts evoked a series of associations in our minds. Their forms of music and dance, such as the seated performance, the bare feet expressing delicate foot movements, the red dot between the dancer's eyebrows, the circular decoration on the arm, the metal bracelets and chimes worn on the wrists and shins, and the graceful yet robust dance postures, are all very familiar to us from countless famous Dunhuang murals.

    In the seven and nine-part music of the Sui Dynasty at the end of the sixth and beginning of the seventh centuries, there was "Tianzhu Ji." Tianzhu is the ancient Chinese name for India. In the nine and ten-part music of the Tang Dynasty in the early and mid-seventh centuries, there was no "Tianzhu Department" but only "Kucha Department." However, Kucha was a place in the middle of the route between India and China at that time, and it was precisely the country in the Western Regions that was most able to absorb Indian culture; the Chinese people in the Tang Dynasty loved Kucha music and dance the most, which was tantamount to saying that they loved Indian music and dance the most. Moreover, the music of countries such as Xiliang, Shule, and Gaochang, which were quite popular during the Sui and Tang Dynasties, also absorbed a large amount of Indian music. No wonder the Dunhuang murals are so full of the atmosphere of Indian music and dance.

    From the music itself, the most prominent feature of Chinese music in the Tang Dynasty was song and dance music, a highly developed art integrating vocal music, instrumental music, and dance; among the instruments at that time, the most valued were plucked string instruments and drums. The current Indian music is also like this. The exquisite and beautiful performances of the Indian experts this time often brought our associations to our grand Tang Dynasty music and dance, and also brought us into the wonderful artistic conceptions that countless Tang Dynasty poets had so brilliantly expressed. The melodious and moving songs, emanating from the depths of the Indian experts' hearts and closely integrated with the dance, conveying rich and profound emotions, their self-assured singing with profound understanding, blending with the instrumental music like a seamless garment, depicting natural scenes such as spring breeze, sweet rain, dark clouds, and lightning, left an indelible aesthetic feeling in the hearts of the listeners. Even though the language is different, what the music conveys is very familiar and very亲切. The cadence and inflection of the lyrics, the ups and downs of the recitation intonation, sound to us like chanting, narration, and Buddhist hymns, as well as song rhymes. They are singing with their mouths, and we are echoing it in our hearts. In this way, in an atmosphere of joy and between the stage and the audience, we continued our two thousand years of close friendship and also realized our deep friendship of today's seamless integration.

    Every solo performance of a musical instrument, every pluck of every solo instrument, makes our heartstrings vibrate accordingly. Unforgettable sitar solo, the graceful and charming lyrical beginning, conveys a profound meaning and deep emotion, leading the listener's heart into the depths of sweet and noble pure love; gradually cooperating with the change of rhythm, the technical release of finger strength, turning to the surging of the power of excited and passionate love; the content and technology are integrated into one, the performer and the listener are simultaneously immersed in the development of the melody's emotion; when the tune is finished, in addition to leaving a feeling that one never tires of hearing, there is still a lingering sound that allows us to make fond memories.

    The curved-neck pipa, which was introduced from the Western Regions during the Northern and Southern Dynasties of China and became one of the famous plucked string instruments after the Sui and Tang Dynasties, may have a source relationship with early Indian music. We know that in India during the reign of the third generation of Kushan King Kanishka (who ascended the throne in 123 AD) in the early second century AD, there was already a pipa similar to the curved-neck pipa, as seen in his Amaravati portrait. This instrument began to gradually spread in China in the fifth century. Later, combined with the scale positions and playing techniques of the old Chinese Han pipa (i.e., "Ruanxian"), the scale positions developed from the initial four frets to sixteen frets, seventeen frets, and even the twenty-four frets of today, and the playing techniques developed from the technique of using a plectrum to the infinitely changing hand-playing techniques of the left and right hands; the melodies also combined with Chinese historical stories and life content to produce many great works. The same instrument, in India, took another path of development; although it also gradually departed from its initial form, the result achieved was different. This shows that China and India have a close blood relationship in music and culture, and each has its own creative independent development; it also shows that although we have gone through a process of independent development, this close blood relationship still allows us to understand each other, communicate our hearts through music, comfort each other, and encourage each other.

    The precious friendship between China and India in history is worth recalling. The mutual learning of our two countries' ancestors in culture is worth emulating. In the mid-seventh century, during the Zhenguan reign of the Tang Dynasty, the famous Chinese monk Xuanzang went to India to obtain scriptures (from 629 to 645 AD). He was protected and warmly received by King Harsha of India, who inquired about the "Qin King's Battle Music" that had been circulating among the Chinese people not long before (see "Records of the Western Regions of the Great Tang" Volume 5). Later, in the mid-eighth century, in the thirteenth year of Tianbao during the Tang Dynasty (754 AD), China also absorbed the Indian "Brahman Tune" that was introduced from the northwest, and after processing and modification, produced the famous "Rainbow Feather Dress Dance" music. This piece of music was warmly welcomed by the ancient Chinese people and was also loved and praised by famous Chinese poets - Bai Juyi's poems have good examples. Undoubtedly, the highly exquisite musical art expressed by the Indian experts this time has been universally and enthusiastically loved by today's Chinese audience, and at the same time has aroused their urgent demand to learn from India today. After each performance, this common desire can be heard at any time in the conversations of Chinese music workers. Everyone feels that it is such a lucky thing to participate in a half-day symposium with Indian experts.

    Chinese people call the best friend a "soulmate," and Indians and Chinese are indeed "soulmates" to each other. Chinese people have always cherished and strived to seek the voice of friendship. The so-called "voice of friendship" has such verses in the "Book of Songs" compiled by Confucius more than two thousand four hundred years ago. We love to listen to the "voice of friendship" brought from India, and we also love to learn this "voice of friendship." At the same time, Indian friends' love for our voices is just like our love for their voices; their desire to learn from us is just as enthusiastic as our desire to learn from them. Our hand-in-hand progress will add new brilliance to the world's musical culture history.

    和平的“友声”
    ——谈印度的歌、舞和器乐
    中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所副所长　杨荫浏
    印度文化代表团在中国的演出，是中、印两国文化史上的一件大事。在我们的历史上，从公元第一世纪汉代直至第十世纪初唐末的一段期间，两国在文化上各方面的互相学习、互相影响、互相滋养、互相促进，配合着那时候中国经济的发展，曾在中国历史上造成光辉灿烂的文化发展高潮；其后的继续交融，也曾成为两国文化发展的重要因素。今天我们有了新的条件来发扬我们两千年来和谐深厚的友情。印度文化代表团的几次演出，使我们对于过去的音乐历史，有了更清楚的认识；我们对于印度的音乐、舞蹈愈来愈热爱。
    仅就中国音乐史研究的角度来看，我们在认识上初步得到的收获已经不小。印度专家们的演出，在我们心中唤起了一系列的联想。他们的乐舞的形态，譬如那种席地而坐的演奏方式，那种赤脚表达脚部细致动作的舞，舞者眉间那样的红点，臂上那样环形的装饰，腕部、胫部所戴的那种金属的钏和串铃，以及那种又婀娜、又刚健的舞姿，都是我们在无数有名的敦煌壁画中所十分熟悉的。
    第六世纪末和第七世纪初隋代的七部乐、九部乐中都有“天竺伎”。天竺就是我们古代对印度的称呼。第七世纪初期和中期，唐代的九部乐、十部乐中已没有“天竺部”而只有“龟兹部”了。但龟兹是当时印度和中国来往要道中间的一个地方，它正是西域诸国中最能吸收印度文化的一个国家；唐时中国人民最爱龟兹乐舞，那就无异于说，他们最爱印度的乐舞。而且隋唐时代也曾相当流行的西凉、疏勒、高昌等国的音乐，它们中间，也大量吸收了印度音乐。无怪敦煌壁画中会这样充满着印度乐舞的气氛。
    从音乐本身看，中国唐代的音乐中最突出的是歌舞音乐，是声乐、器乐、舞蹈三者综合而成的一种高度发展的艺术；当时在器乐中间，最被重视的，是弹弦乐器和鼓类。现在的印度音乐，也是如此。这次印度专家们精致而优美的演出，时时将我们的联想，引到了我们盛大的唐代乐舞上去，也引进了我们无数唐代诗人所曾杰出地抒写过的美妙意境中去。印度专家们从内心深处发出、紧密结合舞蹈的那种传达丰富而深远的感情的悠扬动人的歌声，他们那种顾盼自如、带着深刻的体会而唱出的同器乐融成一体的、宛如无缝的天衣似的描绘春风、甘雨、乌云、雷电等自然情景的曲调，在听者心中留下了不易磨灭的美感。即使语言不同，但音乐所传达的，都是十分熟悉、十分亲切的。歌词节奏的顿挫抑扬，朗诵语调的高低起伏，在我们听来，有咏叹、有叙述、有梵呗，亦有歌韵。他们嘴里在唱，我们心里在同它应合。这样，在一片喜乐的气氛中间，在舞台同听座相隔之间，我们连续了我们两千年久远的世交，也体会了我们今天融合无间的深挚的友谊。
    每一弹乐器的独奏，每一独奏乐器的每一弹、挑，都使我们的心弦随之波动。难忘的锡达尔独奏，那宛转曼妙的抒情的开端，传达出深远的意味和深挚的感情，将听者的心引进了甜蜜而又高尚的纯洁的爱的深处；渐渐配合了节奏的改变，技术上指力的发放，转入于兴奋、热烈的爱的力量的奔腾；内容和技术融成了一片，奏者和听者同时沉浸在曲调情感的发展中间；等到曲调完了，除留下百听不厌的感觉之外，还剩有嫋嫋的余音，可以让我们作留恋的回忆。
    中国南北朝时由西域传入而成为隋、唐以后有名的弹弦乐器之一的曲项琵琶，可能同印度早期的音乐，有着源流关系。我们知道，在公元第二世纪初期大月氐贵霜王第三代迦腻色迦王（登位于公元一二三年）的时候，印度已有类似曲项琵琶的琵琶，见于其阿玛拉洼其画像之中。这一乐器在中国开始渐渐流播，是在第五世纪。其后结合了中国旧有汉琵琶（即“阮咸”）的音位和演奏技术，音位由最初的四柱，发展而为十六柱、十七柱以至今日的二十四柱，演奏的技术由用拨的技术发展而为左右两手变化无穷的手弹技术；曲调也结合了中国历史故事和生活内容产生了很多伟大的作品。同一乐器，在印度，却取了另一条发展路线；虽然同样是渐渐脱离最初的形式，而达到的结果，却是有所不同。这说明中、印两国在音乐文化上有着亲密的血统的关系，也各自有着创造性的独立的发展；同时也说明我们之间虽然经过了各自独立发展的过程，但由于这种亲密的血统关系，仍使我们之间互相了解，通过音乐而互诉心曲、互相安慰和互相鼓励。
    中、印两国历史上珍贵的友谊，是值得回忆的。我们两国的祖先，在文化上的相互学习，是值得效法的。第七世纪中期唐代贞观年间，中国的名僧玄奘法师往印度取经时（自公元六二九年至六四五年），曾受到印度戒日王的保护和热烈的接待，戒日王曾向玄奘法师询问不久以前中国民间流传的“秦王破阵乐”的情形（见“大唐西域记”卷五）。后来到了第八世纪中期，唐代的天宝十三年（公元七五四年），中国也吸收了从西北传入的印度“婆罗门曲”，经过了加工改制而产生了有名的“霓裳羽衣舞”曲。这一乐曲曾受到中国古代人民热烈的欢迎，也曾受到中国有名诗人的爱好和赞美——白居易的诗中就有着很好的例子。无疑的，这次印度专家们所表达的音乐艺术高度的精美，受到了今天中国听众普遍热烈的爱好，同时又引起了他们今天向印度学习的迫切要求。每次演出之后，在中国的音乐工作者的谈话中间，可以随时听到这一普遍的愿望。谁都感觉到参加同印度专家们半日座谈会是一件多么幸运的事。
    中国人称最好的友人为“知音”，印度人同中国人的确是彼此的“知音”。中国人是一向珍视并且努力寻求友谊的声音。所谓“友声”，在两千四百多年以前孔子所订定的诗歌“诗经”中间，就有这样的诗句。我们爱听从印度带来的“友声”，而且也爱学这种“友声”。同时印度友人的热爱我们的声音，也正同我们的热爱他们的声音一样；他们想向我们学习的心情，也正同我们想向他们学习的心情一样的热烈。我们的携手行进，将会在世界音乐文化史上增加新的光辉。
