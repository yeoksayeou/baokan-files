Another Group of Shanghai Junior High School Graduates Goes to the Northwest

On May 30th, seventy-two junior high school graduates from Shanghai happily left Shanghai by train to participate in agricultural and water conservancy construction in the remote Northwest—Gansu. These young male and female students all felt honored to be able to participate in the construction work in the Northwest. Lu Tiefen of Shanghai Zhenli Middle School said excitedly to the parents and classmates who came to see them off before leaving: Our young people's wish is to dedicate our beautiful youth to the great socialist construction of the motherland. We will certainly live up to the country's cultivation of us, and the expectations of our parents and teachers. Song Peihua, a junior high school graduate from Shanghai Yangjing Middle School, had only been married for about half a year, and this time she also signed up to go to Gansu to participate in construction work. Her lover personally sent her to the station.

From September 1954 to April of this year, four batches of more than 930 junior high school graduates in Shanghai have successively gone to the interior of the motherland to participate in construction work. Some went to Qinghai to participate in political power construction and health work in minority pastoral areas, and some went to the Northwest Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways to participate in railway construction work. Still others work in transportation departments such as railway telecommunications.

    上海又一批初中毕业生去西北
    五月三十日，上海有七十二名初中毕业生坐着火车愉快地离开了上海，前往遥远的西北——甘肃参加农业水利建设。这些青年男女学生们都以能够参加西北的建设工作感到光荣。上海真理中学陆铁芬在临行前兴奋地对欢送他们的家长和同学们说：我们青年人的愿望，就是把自己美丽的青春献给祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业，我们一定不会辜负国家对我们的培养，和家长、老师们对我们的期望，上海洋泾中学初中毕业生宋佩华结婚只有半年左右，这次也报名去甘肃参加建设工作，她的爱人亲自把她送到车站。
    从一九五四年九月到今年四月，上海已有四批九百三十余名初中毕业生，先后往祖国内地参加建设工作，他们有的是去青海参加政权建设和少数民族牧区的卫生工作，也有的是到铁道部西北设计局参加铁路建设工作，还有一部分是到铁路电讯等交通运输部门工作。
