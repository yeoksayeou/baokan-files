    Opposing waste and practicing thrift has become a common practice among the workers of the state-owned Tangshan Rolling Stock Repair Factory.

    Upon entering the factory gate, the first thing that catches the eye are the various pledges and statistical figures on savings posted in each workshop. The forty-six key production issues in the "Technical Problems" showcase have all been resolved; twenty-eight small banners and eighteen glorious flowers adorn this showcase. As soon as the quitting whistle blows, the workers leaving the workshops rush to every corner, enthusiastically engaging in activities such as collecting waste materials and checking for waste. Since the launch of the campaign against waste and for thrift in early May, workers have collected a large number of various old metal materials and equipment. The boiler workshop alone utilized more than five tons of waste materials in May, saving the state more than 54,000 yuan.

    In carrying out the anti-waste struggle, the factory's workers studied the question of "why waste materials are always available for picking up." Based on the results of their study, they first started by improving enterprise management, focusing on weak links, and establishing and improving certain systems. For example, the first process, the locomotive dismantling workshop, is key to the factory's overall savings. In the past, due to the inaccurate determination of the scope of repairs, many people had thoughts of "repairing is better than not repairing, replacing (parts) is easier than repairing," fearing responsibility and trouble, which affected the waste of manpower and materials in other workshops and directly affected the quality of parts and the completion of the daily work plan. While mobilizing workers to criticize these erroneous ideas, the factory established and improved various technical management systems, revised unreasonable quotas, giving dismantling and inspection personnel accurate bases. It also formulated forty kinds of old parts remanufacturing standards, allowing a large number of old materials to be revived. This item alone can save more than 600,000 yuan by the end of the year. The frame workshop established a centralized blanking system, no longer arbitrarily cutting steel plates; in the past month alone, it has used scrap steel plates to cut more than 1,200 axle box friction plates.

    Workers enthusiastically came up with various methods to save. Guo Bin, a material clerk in the passenger car workshop, successfully formulated a paint stripper, which reduced the cost by nearly 30% compared to purchasing paint stripper externally, saving more than 42,000 yuan annually. Gu Deming, an engineer in the laboratory, worked with the workers to regenerate used hard grease, saving more than seven tons of new oil annually. After careful calculation, the materials section established systems such as old material recycling, and reduced the third-quarter supply plan, freeing up more than 400,000 yuan of funds from being tied up. The timber workshop corrected the phenomenon of using large materials for small purposes. In early May, compared with the same period in April, the material extraction rate of Manchurian ash increased by 45%, and the material extraction rate of Korean pine increased by 49%.

    唐山机车车辆修理工厂的节约风气
    新华社记者　方凌
    反对浪费、厉行节约，在国营唐山机车车辆修理工厂的职工中，已经形成普遍的风气。
    走进工厂大门，最先引人注意的是各车间张贴出的各种保证书和节约统计数字。“技术课题”橱窗里的四十六项生产关键课题都已经得到了解答；二十八面小锦旗和十八朵光荣花把这个橱窗点缀得灿烂夺目。下班汽笛刚刚响过，走出车间的工人们又奔向各个角落，热情地投入了搜集废料，检查浪费的活动。从五月初开展反对浪费、厉行节约以来，职工们已经搜拣出大批各种旧金属器材，只锅炉车间在五月份利用的废料就有五吨多，为国家节约了五万四千多元。
    这个厂在开展反浪费斗争中，职工们研究了“为什么废料随拣随有”这个问题。他们根据研究结果，首先从改进企业管理入手，抓住薄弱环节，建立和健全了一些制度。如第一道工序、机车拆车车间是决定全厂节约的关键，过去由于检修范围确定得不准确，许多人存在着“修比不修强，换（机件）比修省事”的怕负责任、怕麻烦的思想，影响到其他车间在检修中浪费了人力物力，并直接影响到部件质量和日作业计划的完成。在发动职工批判这些错误思想的同时，厂里建立和健全了各种技术管理制度，修订了不合理的定额，使拆车分解检查员有了准确依据：并制定出四十种旧机件改制标准，使大批旧料可以复活。仅这一项，到年底就可以节约六十万元以上。车架车间建立了集中下料制，不再任意裁割铁板；在最近一个月中就利用零碎铁板割制出一千二百多块轴箱磨铁。
    职工们热情地想出各种办法来进行节约。客车车间材料员郭斌配制脱漆剂成功，比外购脱漆剂的成本降低近百分之三十，全年可以节约四万二千多元。化验室工程师顾德明和工人们一道把用过的硬凝脂油再制成功，全年可以节约七吨多新油。材料科经过精打细算，建立起旧料回收等制度，缩减第三季度供应计划，使四十多万元资金免于积压。制材车间纠正了大材小用的现象，五月上旬和四月同期相比，水曲柳木的取材率提高百分之四十五，油松木的取材率提高了百分之四十九。
