    A Handicraft Production Cooperative Organized by Returned Overseas Chinese
    By our correspondent Wu Erxiang

    Guangzhou No. 5 Confectionery Production Cooperative is a handicraft production cooperative organized by returned overseas Chinese, returned refugees, and relatives of overseas Chinese from Indonesia, Malaya, Australia, and other places. In the past, they were all poor laborers, some of whom were originally confectionery technicians, and some were small producers, but most were housewives. Although their experiences and encounters were different, in the embrace of the motherland and under the care of the Party and the government, they have all become one family, participating in the construction of the motherland and creating their own happiness through their labor.

    On a sunny day in early summer, I visited this cooperative. The director of the cooperative, Ou Jingzong, is an overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia and an experienced confectionery technician. He introduced the situation of the cooperative to me: "Our cooperative was established in February 1954. At that time, we relied entirely on manual labor. Now we have installed two sugar pressing machines, and the output has increased from 600 jin to 2,000 jin per day. The number of workers has also increased from twenty-seven to thirty-eight. Originally, the total capital was only more than 8,000 yuan, of which more than 6,000 yuan was loaned by the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. Now we have 20,000 yuan in working capital, the loan has been repaid, and another 2,500 yuan has been spent on installing two machines. With the development of production, the income of the members has also increased. At the beginning, the monthly salary of the technicians was only 60 yuan, but now the highest is 85 yuan; especially the packaging workers, because they were housewives in the past and did not know how to package at the beginning, their monthly income was less than 15 yuan, but now the minimum income is 30 yuan, and the maximum monthly income is more than 50 yuan. At the end of last year, the members were also given 'labor dividends' equivalent to one and a half months' wages." "But," he continued, "it was not easy for us to start. Without the care and help of the Party and the government, we would not be where we are today."

    Indeed, when it comes to the cooperative's beginnings, the members are all deeply grateful for the care and help of the Party and the government. They were originally poor overseas Chinese, especially the refugees expelled by the imperialists, who had nothing when they returned to the motherland. The Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee not only helped them solve their living difficulties but also helped them organize themselves and establish a confectionery handicraft production cooperative, helped them find houses, and provided loans. Even the 50-yuan membership shares of many members were loaned by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. The sugar produced by the cooperative was originally self-produced and self-sold. Although only 600 jin of sugar was produced a day at that time, because the outside world was not familiar with their products, they could not find a sales channel, so they often had to stop production for two days after one day of production. Later, the Guangzhou Municipal Cooperative Federation helped to sell 200 jin every day, and the sales channel was slowly opened up. Now all their products are sold by the Cooperative Federation.

    The technical level of the members has also been gradually improved. At the beginning, only seven of the twenty-seven members were technicians, and the rest were housewives, but now they are all skilled workers. A female worker, Wu Jinlan, told me: "When I was in Malaya, I only managed household chores and had never seen how to make candy. When I first came here, I would watch others do it whenever I had time and learned little by little. Now I have learned the general techniques, and even the most difficult process of boiling sugar."

    Most of the female members in the packaging group are young girls. Initially, twelve of them could not finish packing thirty jin of sugar a day. After a few months, one person could pack thirty jin a day. After learning from each other and exchanging experiences, now they can generally pack sixty or seventy jin a day.

    一个归国华侨组织的手工业生产合作社
    本报记者　吴尔祥
    广州市第五糖果生产合作社，是一个由印度尼西亚、马来亚、澳洲等地归国的华侨、难侨和华侨眷属组织起来的手工业生产合作社。他们过去都是贫苦劳动人民，有的原来就是糖果技术工人，有的是小生产者，但是大部分都是家庭妇女。他们虽然经历不同，遭遇不同，但是在祖国的怀抱里，在党和政府的关怀下，都变成了一家人，以自己的劳动参加着祖国的建设和创造着自己的幸福。
    在初夏的一个晴朗的日子里，我访问了这个合作社。社主任欧敬宗，是从印度尼西亚归国的华侨，一个有经验的糖果技术工人。他向我介绍了社里的情况：“我们这个社是在一九五四年二月成立起来的，那个时候全靠手工劳动，现在已经装置了两部压糖机，产量由每天六百斤提高到了二千斤。工人也由二十七个人增加到三十八个人。原来资金一共只有八千多元，其中有六千多元还是广东省华侨事务委员会贷给的。现在我们流动资金就有二万元，贷款还清了，另外还花了二千五百元装置了两部机器。生产发展了，社员的收入也增加了，技术工人开始时每月工资只有六十元，现在最高的有八十五元；特别是包装工人，因为她们过去都是家庭妇女，开始时不会包，一个月的收入还达不到十五元，但是现在最少的收入也有三十元，多的每月收入五十多元。去年年底还发给社员相当于社员一个半月工资的‘劳动返还金’。”“但是”他接着说：“我们起家可不是容易的，如果没有党和政府对我们的关怀帮助，我们是不会有今天的。”
    的确，说起这个社的起家，社员们都在心底里感激着党和政府对他们的关怀和帮助。他们原来都是些贫苦的华侨，特别是被帝国主义驱逐出境的难侨，回到祖国时什么都没有。广东省华侨事务委员会不但帮助他们解决了生活上的困难，并且帮助他们组织起来成立了糖果手工业生产合作社，帮助他们找房子，还贷给资金，甚至许多社员的五十元的入社股金也是靠华侨事务委员会贷给的。合作社最初生产的糖果是自产自销，虽然当时一天只出六百斤糖果，因为外面对他们的产品还不熟悉，找不到销路，结果往往是生产一天要停两天。以后由广州市合作总社每天帮助推销二百斤，才慢慢地打开了销路，现在他们的产品已全部由合作总社包销了。
    社员的技术水平也是慢慢地提高起来的。开始二十七个社员中，只有七个是技术工人，其他都是家庭妇女，但是现在全都是熟练的工人了。女工吴金兰对我说：“我过去在马来亚的时候，只管理家务，见都没有见过做糖果的。刚来这里时，一有空就去看别人怎样做，一点一点地学，现在一般技术都学会了，连最困难的煮糖也学会了。”
    包装组的女社员大部分是年轻的姑娘，她们最初十二个人一天包装三十斤糖果还包不完。几个月后，一个人一天就能包三十斤了。经过互相学习，交流经验，现在一般的一天都能包六、七十斤了。
