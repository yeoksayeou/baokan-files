    Cleansing Hidden Enemies from the Revolutionary Ranks
    Zhang Xi-ruo

    The "People's Daily" has published the "Third Batch of Materials Regarding the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique." These materials further and more thoroughly expose the mask of the Hu Feng group. Hu Feng and the core members within his group had close ties with Kuomintang secret service agencies long ago. They were the loyal running dogs of the imperialist Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. For more than twenty years, the Hu Feng group, cloaked in the guise of Marxism, consistently adopted the most insidious and despicable two-faced tactics to sabotage the people's revolutionary cause. They are organized, strategic, resolute counter-revolutionaries, and they are the public enemy of the Chinese people.

    Regarding the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, any patriotic citizen with a sense of justice is bound to be filled with indignation and find it unbearable. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's hatred for the people and the revolution reached a state of madness: they compared the people's revolutionary forces to "pus," believing that it "must be drained." Before liberation, they expressed "optimism" and "encouragement" towards their master Chiang's ravings—such as "we can defeat [them] in three months" and "eliminate" the revolutionary forces in a year—while describing the approaching victory of the people's revolution as "welcoming hardship." After the national liberation, they bitterly hated the new society and the new regime. They even more frantically and covertly used every means possible to infiltrate state organs, "penetrating into" our "liver" to carry out various conspiracies. They dreamed of the "demise" of the people's regime, pinning their hopes on the restoration of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. All of this shows that the Hu Feng group are incorrigible dregs who are determined to be enemies of the people. Such counter-revolutionary crimes must be severely suppressed. If there is even a little "mercy" or "leniency" towards counter-revolutionaries, that is disloyal to the people's revolutionary cause.

    The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a major victory for the Party and the people. At the same time, however, the Hu Feng incident once again sounds the alarm for us. The class struggle during the transition period is extremely complex and acute. This understanding cannot simply remain in our minds; we must be vigilant at all times and fight against all kinds of counter-revolutionaries in our actual actions. Hidden class enemies will lurk in every corner. They are extremely cunning, and they will disguise themselves very cleverly. They understand that they must "immerse themselves in work and build a good mass base." They often need to "prepare conditions" well before aiming at the vital parts of the revolution to shoot. Obviously, under these circumstances, any bit of negligence or any bit of liberalism will inevitably cause great losses to the country and the people.

    Thoroughly smashing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and clearing out all the hidden counter-revolutionary elements within the revolutionary ranks is a major political task for every patriot. Let us unite closely around the Party and Chairman Mao, sharpen our political senses, strengthen our fighting will, and fight to the end to defend the achievements of the revolution and build a socialist society!

    清除革命队伍中的暗藏敌人
    张奚若
    “人民日报”发表了“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”。这些材料更进一步、更彻底地揭穿了胡风集团的假面。胡风及其集团内的核心分子很早就同国民党特务机关有着密切联系，他们是帝国主义蒋介石匪帮的忠实走狗。二十多年来，胡风集团披着马克思主义的外衣，一贯采取最阴险、最卑鄙的两面手法，来破坏人民革命事业。他们是有组织的、有策略的坚决的反革命分子，他们是中国人民的公敌。
    对于胡风反革命集团的罪行，任何一个爱国的、具有正义感的公民都必然是气愤填膺，忍无可忍的。胡风反革命集团对于人民、对于革命的仇视达到了疯狂的地步：他们把人民革命力量比做是“脓”，认为“总要排出”。在解放前，他们对他们的主子蒋贼的梦呓——如“三个月可以击破”，“一年肃清”革命力量等等，表示着“乐观”和“鼓舞”，而把面临着人民革命的胜利则说成是“迎接苦难”。全国解放后他们刻骨地仇恨着新社会、新政权，他们更加疯狂地、更加隐蔽地使用千方百计打入国家机关部门，“深入到”我们的“肝脏里面”进行着种种的阴谋活动。他们梦想人民政权“灭亡”，他们把希望寄托在蒋介石反动统治的复辟上。所有这一切都说明胡风集团是至死不悟，坚决同人民为敌的败类，对于他们这种反革命罪行必须予以严厉镇压。如果对于反革命分子存在一点点的“仁慈”和“宽大”，那就是不忠于人民的革命事业。
    胡风反革命集团的揭露是党和人民的一个重大的胜利。但同时，胡风事件也再一次为我们敲起了警钟。过渡时期的阶级斗争是极其复杂和尖锐的，这一点不能单单停留在我们的认识上，而必须在实际行动上随时提高警惕，随时同各种各样的反革命分子作斗争。暗藏的阶级敌人会潜伏在各个角落。他们是极其狡猾的，他们会极巧妙地伪装自己。他们懂得要“埋头工作，把群众基础弄好”。他们常常要很好地“准备条件”，然后对准革命的要害进行射击。很明显，在这种情况下，我们任何一点点的麻痹大意，任何一点点的自由主义作风，都必然会使国家、人民遭受到极大的损失。
    彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，清除革命队伍内部的一切暗藏的反革命分子，这是我们每一个爱国者的重大政治任务。让我们紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围，提高政治嗅觉，加强战斗意志，为保卫革命成果，为建成社会主义社会而奋斗到底！
