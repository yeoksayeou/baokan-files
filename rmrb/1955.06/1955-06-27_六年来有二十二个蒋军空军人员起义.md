After KMT Air Force Lieutenant and Second-Class Intelligence Officer He Weiqin, who defected on May 18th, recently arrived in Beijing for a visit, it marks the 14th defection incident in the KMT Air Force since 1949. In the past six years, twenty-two KMT Air Force personnel have defected and returned to the embrace of the motherland.

In 1949, Du Daoshi, Captain and Squad Leader of the 34th Squadron of the 8th Group of the KMT Air Force, and Hao Ziyi, a mechanic of the 20th Group, among three batches totaling four people, defected by flying their aircraft. In 1950, KMT Air Force Aviation School flight students Huang Yonghua, Li Chun, and Liu Xishang successively flew three trainer aircraft from Taiwan back to the mainland of the motherland. In 1951, Shi Dianwen, a mechanic foreman from the KMT Air Force's special aircraft group, and another person defected by flying an aircraft. In 1953, Ye Gang, a captain and navigator from the 1st Group of the KMT Air Force, and another batch totaling four people defected by flying their aircraft. In 1954, Huang Tiejun, a captain and operations staff officer from the 8th Group of the KMT Air Force, and Hu Hongyi, a flight student from the KMT Air Force Aviation School, in two batches totaling three people, defected by flying their aircraft. Since the beginning of this year, Liu Ruolong, Song Baorong, He Weiqin, and others in three batches totaling six people, have flown back to the motherland.

The KMT Air Force personnel who defected by flying their aircraft have all been warmly welcomed by the people of the motherland. The People's Government, according to the principle of assigning jobs according to their abilities, has made proper arrangements for them. Over the past few years, with the education and cultivation of the motherland and the people, they have made considerable progress. Du Daoshi, who was a captain and squadron leader in the KMT Air Force before his defection, is now a deputy battalion commander in a certain unit of the People's Air Force. Hao Ziyi, who was a mechanic before his defection, is now the chief of the maintenance department in a certain unit of the People's Air Force. Huang Yonghua, a KMT Air Force flight student, has become a navigation teaching assistant in a certain unit of the People's Air Force. Hu Hongyi, a KMT Air Force flight student, is now working in the Civil Aviation Administration of China. (Xinhua News Agency report)

    六年来有二十二个蒋军空军人员起义
    五月十八日驾机起义后在最近到达北京参观的蒋军空军中尉二级情报官何伟钦，是一九四九年以来蒋军空军中发生的第十四次起义事件。六年来，已经有二十二个蒋军空军人员起义回到祖国怀抱。
    一九四九年，有蒋军空军八大队三十四中队上尉分队长杜道时和二十大队机械士郝子仪等三批四人驾机起义。一九五零年，蒋军空军军官学校飞行生黄永华、李纯、刘希尚先后驾三架教练机自台湾飞回祖国大陆。一九五一年，蒋军空军专机组机工长史殿文等二人驾机起义。一九五三年有蒋军空军一大队上尉领航员叶刚等二批四人驾机起义。一九五四年有蒋军空军八大队上尉作战参谋黄铁骏、蒋军空军军官学校飞行生胡弘一二批三人驾机起义。今年以来，已经有刘若龙、宋宝荣、何伟钦等三批六人驾机飞回祖国。
    驾机起义的蒋军空军人员都受到了祖国人民的热烈欢迎。人民政府根据量才录用的原则，对他们都进行了妥善的安置。几年来，他们在祖国和人民的教育、培养下，都有不少进步。起义前是蒋军空军上尉分队长的杜道时现在是人民空军某部的副大队长。起义前是机械士的郝子仪，现在是人民空军某部的机务主任。蒋军空军飞行生黄永华已成为人民空军某部的领航助教。蒋军空军飞行生胡弘一，现在中国民用航空局工作。（据新华社讯）
