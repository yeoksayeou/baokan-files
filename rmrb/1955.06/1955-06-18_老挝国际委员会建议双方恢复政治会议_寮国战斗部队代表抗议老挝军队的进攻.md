    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 16th. According to Vientiane radio broadcasts, the International Commission for Laos recently sent a notification to both the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units. In the notification, the International Commission pointed out the necessity of fully implementing the armistice agreement and suggested that both sides resume political conferences and negotiations to quickly resolve the political issues of Laos.
    The notification stated that the International Commission confirms the joint declaration issued by both sides on March 9th, in which both sides guaranteed that they would not use military forces in the provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua. However, the declaration has not had any effect since its publication, and the situation has become more serious. The notification pointed out that the interruption of political conferences is the reason for the increasingly complex and serious situation.
    The notification said: "Under these circumstances, the International Commission suggests that both sides resume negotiations to quickly find a political solution."
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 16th. According to the Vietnam News Agency: Kaysone, a representative of the General Command of the Lao Fighting Units, submitted a memorandum to the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission for Laos on the 12th, protesting the new military infiltration of Sam Neua province by the Royal Lao Army and the attacks on the Lao Fighting Units in the Muong Phine area.
    The memorandum pointed out that at the beginning of this month, the Royal Government sent the 8th Infantry Battalion to occupy many places in Sam Neua province, a regroupment area of the Lao Fighting Units. At the same time, the Royal Army stationed in Muong Phine also occupied a place northwest of Muong Phine and fired twice at the Lao troops near Muong Phine. All these military actions were carried out openly while the international inspection team was in Muong Phine.
    The memorandum pointed out that these actions seriously violated the Lao Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities. Kaysone, representing the General Command of the Lao Fighting Units, demanded that the International Commission immediately conduct an on-site investigation with the participation of Lao officers, and use its authority to urge the Royal Government to cease all military offensives and immediately withdraw the 8th Infantry Battalion and other armed groups currently occupying the Muong Phine area from Sam Neua province.

    老挝国际委员会建议双方恢复政治会议
    寮国战斗部队代表抗议老挝军队的进攻
    新华社河内十六日电　据万象电台广播，老挝国际委员会最近送给老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队一份通知书。国际委员会在通知书中指出必须充分履行停战协定，并且建议双方恢复政治会议，重新进行谈判，以迅速解决老挝的政治问题。
    通知书说，国际委员会确认双方在三月九日发表的联合声明，双方在联合声明中保证将不在丰沙里、桑怒两省使用军事力量，但声明发表后，没有取得任何效果，而情况愈加严重。通知书指出，政治会议的被中断，是使情况更加复杂和严重的原因。
    通知书说：“在这种情况下，国际委员会建议双方重新进行谈判，以迅速找到一个政治解决办法。”
    新华社河内十六日电　据越南通讯社讯：寮国战斗部队总司令部代表凯山在十二日向老挝国际监督和监察委员会提出一项备忘录，抗议老挝王国军队对桑怒省进行新的军事渗入以及对芒奔地区寮国战斗部队的进攻。
    备忘录指出，本月初，王国政府派遣了第八步兵营占领了寮国战斗部队集结区桑怒省的许多地方。同时，驻扎在芒奔的王国军队也占领了芒奔西北的一个地方，并且两次向芒奔附近的寮国部队开火。所有这些军事行动都是在国际视察小组在芒奔的时候公开进行的。
    备忘录指出，这些行动严重地违反了老挝停止敌对行动协定。凯山代表寮国战斗部队总司令部要求国际委员会立刻在寮国军官的参加下进行现场调查，并且使用它的权力，促使王国政府方面停止一切军事进攻，立刻从桑怒省撤退目前占领了芒奔地区的第八步兵营和其他武装集团。
