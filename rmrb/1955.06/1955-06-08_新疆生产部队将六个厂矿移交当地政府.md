The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps stationed in southern Xinjiang recently transferred all six factories and mines in Kashgar City, formerly under the Southern Xinjiang Production Management Office, to the Xinjiang Province Southern Xinjiang Administrative Office as local state-owned factories and mines.

The six factories and mines are: Kashgar Farm Implement Factory, Kashgar Flour Mill, the Kashgar Hydroelectric Power Plant under construction, the former Southern Xinjiang Production Management Office's printing factory, the Uqia Coal Mine, and the Kashgar Ceramics Factory. These factories and mines were all established by the People's Liberation Army stationed in southern Xinjiang through years of thrift and hard work. The Kashgar Farm Implement Factory, Kashgar Flour Mill, and Kashgar Hydroelectric Power Plant, among others, are of considerable size. The Farm Implement Factory will supply farmers in various parts of southern Xinjiang with more than 10,000 new-style farm implements such as seven-inch plows and nail tooth harrows this year. The Flour Mill has advanced mechanical equipment, and the flour it produces can supply the needs of about 80% of the residents of Kashgar City. The power from the Hydroelectric Power Plant can not only supply the power needs of factories in Kashgar City, but also supply lighting electricity for various government offices and schools in Kashgar City.

After these factories and mines are taken over by the Southern Xinjiang Administrative Office, they will lay the foundation for local industry in the southern Xinjiang region, which is inconvenient for transportation, and play a positive role in the development of production of farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups south of the Tianshan Mountains and the change of the economic outlook of the vast areas of southern Xinjiang.

    新疆生产部队将六个厂矿移交当地政府
    新疆军区驻南疆生产建设部队，最近把前南疆生产管理处所属在喀什市的六个厂矿，全部移交给新疆省南疆行署作为地方国营厂矿。
    这六个厂矿是：喀什农具厂，喀什面粉厂和正在修建中的喀什水力发电厂，前南疆生产管理处的印刷厂，乌恰煤矿和喀什陶瓷厂。这些厂矿都是几年来驻在新疆南部的人民解放军节衣缩食、辛勤劳动建立起来的。其中喀什农具厂、喀什面粉厂、喀什水力发电厂等的规模都相当大。农具厂今年将供给南疆各地农民一万多件七寸步犁和钉齿耙等新式农具。面粉厂拥有先进的机械设备，生产的面粉可以供应喀什市百分之八十左右居民的需要。水力发电厂的电力，不但可以供应喀什市工厂的动力需要，还可以供应喀什市各机关、学校的照明用电。
    这些厂矿由南疆行署接管以后，将给交通不便的南疆地区的地方工业奠定基础，对天山以南各族农牧民生产的发展和南疆广大地区经济面貌的改变起积极的作用。
