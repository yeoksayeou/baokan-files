Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 2nd: Vientiane Radio broadcast on the 1st that the Lao Royal National Assembly decided to postpone the general election to December 25th of this year. The radio broadcast stated that the reason for the postponement of the general election was that the Royal Government's "negotiations with the Lao Fighting Units have not yet concluded," and also because "August is the rainy season, making it difficult for voters to vote."

The Lao Royal Government unilaterally announced on May 25th that it would elect the thirty-nine members of the parliament by general election on August 28th of this year. This decision has been widely opposed by people from all walks of life in Laos.

    老挝王国政府宣布延期举行选举
    新华社河内二日电　据万象电台一日广播，老挝王国国民议会决定把普选延迟到今年十二月二十五日举行。电台广播说，延迟普选的原因是王国政府“同寮国战斗部队的谈判还没有结束”，同时因为“八月份是雨季，选民不好投票。”
    老挝王国政府曾在五月二十五日片面宣布在今年八月二十八日以普选方式选举议会的三十九名议员，这一决定受到了老挝各阶层人士的广泛反对。
