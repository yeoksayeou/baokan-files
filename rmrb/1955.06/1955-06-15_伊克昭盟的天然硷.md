The Ikh Chao League's Natural Soda

    Bai Gele

    Near the Yellow River ferry near Baotou, one can see vehicles laden with grayish-white soda blocks driving on the road to Baotou. This is the famous natural soda from the Ikh Chao League of Inner Mongolia.

    Soda lakes are distributed in the Otog Banner, the most remote and vast area of the Ikh Chao League. More than seventy soda lakes of various sizes have been discovered. According to preliminary estimates, the reserves of natural soda are about 200 million tons. The season for mining natural soda is from November to March of the following year, when the lakes freeze. Mining natural soda is relatively convenient. Just break the thin ice layer and you can scoop out the soda crystals from the bottom of the lake.

    In the past, for a long time, the problem with natural soda was not mining, but transportation. Every year, the Ikh Chao League People's Government mobilized tens of thousands of ox carts and rubber-wheeled vehicles to transport the soda from the production area to Baotou, eight hundred li away, for processing, or from Baotou to distant cities such as Tianjin for further processing. This not only caused waste in transportation, but also forced the cost of natural soda, which was originally very low, to increase. Therefore, in 1951, the Ikh Chao League People's Government established a small processing plant in Otog Banner. However, because it was far from the production area and the raw material supply was insufficient, each worker only produced 250 jin of soda ash per day. Therefore, the following year, the factory was moved to Shizuishan, near the soda lake, and the factory buildings and equipment were expanded. In 1953, the factory produced more than 564,000 jin of soda ash, which was unprecedented.

    With the development of national economic construction, this soda ash factory is also constantly developing and growing. In 1954, the state invested 350,000 yuan to carry out basic construction according to needs. Bright brick and wood factory buildings have replaced cave dwellings and yurts. The workers have also moved into beautiful new homes. The number of employees has increased from sixteen in 1953 to more than two hundred. Soda ash production has been increasing year by year. In 1954, 3,000 tons of soda ash were produced. In the first quarter of this year, the state plan was overfulfilled again.

    Although many workers joined the production in 1954, due to their hard work in learning technology, labor productivity has greatly improved. If in the first half of 1954, each worker produced 525 kilograms of soda ash per working day, then by the end of the year, each working day was more than 3,400 kilograms. At the same time, the purity of product quality has also improved.

    The soda workers responded to the call of the Ikh Chao League Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and actively launched a campaign to increase production and practice thrift. In the iron bucket (for packing soda ash) workshop, in the past, each iron sheet could make eight bucket lids, but now it can make twelve bucket lids. Workers in the lime burning (for soda ash production) workshop adopted the method of mixing coal cinder with coal to reduce coal consumption. These two items alone saved the state 4,330 yuan. For example, in the past, 2.24 kilograms of natural soda were used to produce 1 kilogram of soda ash. Since the launch of the production increase and thrift competition, 2.04 kilograms of natural soda can be processed into 1 kilogram of soda ash.

    The state plans to expand this factory into a soda ash factory with semi-mechanized equipment in the next few years. At that time, tens of thousands of tons of soda ash will be produced, continuously supplying the needs of the food industry and the chemical industry as raw materials.

    伊克昭盟的天然硷
    白歌乐
    到包头附近的黄河渡口，人们可以看见满载灰白色大硷块的车辆行驶在通往包头的公路上，这就是著名的内蒙古伊克昭盟天然硷。
    硷湖分布在伊克昭盟最边远最辽阔的鄂托克旗境内。现在已经发现的大小硷湖有七十多个。据初步估计，天然硷的蕴藏量约有二亿吨。每年十一月到次年三月结冻时期，是采掘天然硷的季节。采掘天然硷比较方便，只要破开薄冰层，就可从湖底捞出硷的结晶体。
    在过去很长一个时期，天然硷的问题不在于开采，而是在于运输。每年伊克昭盟人民政府动员几万辆牛车和胶轮车，由产硷地运输到八百里远的包头加工，或者再由包头运到遥远的天津等城市加工。这样不仅在运输上造成浪费，而且本来成本很低的天然硷不得不提高成本。所以，伊克昭盟人民政府于一九五一年在鄂托克旗建立了一座小型加工厂。但因为离产地远，原料供应不充足，每个工人每天才生产二百五十斤烧硷。所以在第二年又把这个厂移到了靠近硷湖的石咀山，并扩大了厂房设备。一九五三年这个厂生产了五十六万四千多斤烧硷，这是从来没有过的事情。
    随着国家经济建设的发展，这个制硷厂也在不断发展和壮大中。一九五四年国家根据需要投资三十五万元，进行了基本建设。代替窑洞和蒙古包的已经是敞亮的砖木厂房。职工们也住上了漂亮的新居。职工人数已经由一九五三年的十六人增加到二百多人。烧硷生产量逐年上升，一九五四年生产了三千吨烧硷。今年第一季度，又超额完成了国家计划。
    虽然有许多工人是一九五四年新参加生产的，但由于他们努力学习技术，劳动生产率有了很大的提高。如果一九五四年上半年每个工人每个工作日生产五百二十五公斤烧硷，那么到年底时每个工作日已经是三千四百多公斤了。同时产品质量的纯度也提高了。
    硷工们响应中共伊克昭盟盟委的号召，积极开展了增产节约运动。制铁桶（装烧硷的）车间，过去每张铁板制八个桶盖，现在能制出十二个桶盖；烧石灰（制硷用）车间工人采用煤渣拌好煤办法降低了煤的损耗率。这两项就给国家节省四千三百三十元资金。又如，过去每二点二四公斤天然硷制一公斤烧硷，自从开展增产节约竞赛后，二点零四公斤天然硷就能加工出一公斤烧硷。
    国家计划在今后几年内，把这个厂扩建成有半机械化设备的制硷厂。到那个时候，将生产出数以万吨计的烧硷，源源不断地供应食品工业和化学工业原料的需要。
