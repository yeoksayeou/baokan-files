Xinjiang Uses Airplanes to Prospect for Oil
Xinjiang Petroleum Company has begun using airplanes to establish base points for gravity and magnetic prospecting work in exploring buried structures. The fixed-point flight work officially started on June 9th and will continue until August. This is the first time that China has used airplanes in coordination with geophysical prospecting teams to prospect for oil.
In the past, Xinjiang Petroleum Company's geophysical prospecting work was often affected by the lack of established base points, which affected the accuracy of gravity and magnetic prospecting. This year, the company decided to use 100 hours of flight time to establish all the base points in the Xinjiang oil prospecting area within three months. With these base points, it is possible not only to correct the achievements of past geophysical prospecting but also to ensure the accuracy of future prospecting work and greatly improve the efficiency of prospecting work.

Yumen Oilfield to Drill First Inclined Well
Yumen Oilfield will drill China's first inclined oil well in the newly discovered oil-bearing layer of the Laojunmiao Oilfield. At present, the Yumen Mining Bureau is actively formulating construction plans, preparing materials, and leveling the well site.
This newly discovered oil-bearing layer is part of the Laojunmiao Oilfield. Due to geological changes a long time ago, a fault was formed, and this oil layer was separated from the currently exploited oil-bearing layers. Over the past few years, Chinese geological workers, with the help of Soviet experts, finally discovered this oil layer and confirmed it in actual drilling in 1954. According to preliminary analysis by geological personnel, the oil storage capacity of this new oil layer is at least one-tenth of the oil storage capacity of the currently exploited oil layers in the Laojunmiao Oilfield.
The structure of this new oil layer is very special. The oil layer is almost perpendicular to the ground, and an inclined well must be drilled to explore the entire storage situation. However, the technology of drilling inclined wells is very complex, and drilling an inclined well using general drilling methods takes much more time than drilling a straight well. Soviet drilling experts will help workers and technicians at Yumen Oilfield master the technology of drilling inclined wells. Advanced Soviet turbine drills will also be used throughout the drilling project.

Two Large Coalfields Discovered in Hunan Province
Large coalfields have recently been discovered in Zixing area and Chenxian and Yongxing areas of Hunan Province.
In the Zixing area, the staff of the geological exploration team conducted exploration work in an area of dozens of square kilometers and found that the coal reserves in this area are quite rich. According to the currently calculated mineral reserves, a huge coal mine can be built here, which is larger in scale than any existing coal mine in the province.
According to preliminary investigations by geological staff, the reserves in the newly discovered coalfield in Chenxian Yongxing area are even richer than the Zixing coalfield. This coalfield is distributed in the Xujiadong, Loufengdu, Gaotingsi, and Matianxu areas along the Yuehan Railway, covering a vast area and with convenient transportation. At present, topographical surveying and geological survey personnel are conducting geological surveys and other work in this area. After the drilling task in the Zixing mining area is basically completed in July, large-scale drilling will begin in this area.

Newly Reclaimed Red Soil in Jiangxi Achieves Good Harvests
The crops planted on more than 1,000 mu of red soil reclaimed by the Jiangxi Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Henggang and other places in Nanchang County have achieved good harvests. In recent days, workers from the Agricultural Research Institute have been harvesting large quantities of fruitful fruits, wheat, and rye in the orchards and on the slopes of the red soil. Four years ago, most of the slash pines planted on more than 15,000 mu of red soil across the province have become forests, and Cunninghamia lanceolata, camphor trees, oil-tea trees, and various fruit trees have been planted among the forests.
When conducting research on the utilization of red soil, scientific workers from the Jiangxi Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences visited mountainous areas in southern Jiangxi and counties such as Yugan, Jinxian, Gaoan, Fengcheng, Fuliang, and Wuyuan over the years to investigate the utilization of red soil by local farmers and find out experiences and methods for utilizing red soil. According to surveys, there are more than 15 million mu of red soil wasteland that can be utilized in Jiangxi. After these red soil wastelands are utilized, the province's cultivated land area can be increased by about one-third.

Meishan Reservoir Implements Mechanized Operations
As the Huai River enters the flood season, the construction project of the Meishan Reservoir on the Shi River is becoming even more intense. As of June 10th, the concrete poured for the reservoir's multiple-arch dam accounted for more than 60% of the total concrete project. At present, the buttress walls of the multiple-arch dam have generally been poured to 108 meters, and the dam arches have generally been poured to 89 meters. Workers are striving to pour all the dam arches of the multiple-arch dam to 110 meters in early July, so that the Meishan Reservoir can play a role in intercepting and storing the floodwaters of the Shi River during this year's flood season.
As the Meishan Reservoir project enters high-altitude operations, the level of mechanical operations is increasing day by day. Scaffolding towers, cableways, winding roads, and belt conveyors and other machinery are used on the construction site, and the daily concrete pouring volume is about 1,000 cubic meters.

    国营友谊农场完成开荒两万公顷的任务
    到六月九日为止，国营友谊农场职工已开荒两万零三百多公顷，胜利地超额完成了国家所交给他们的开荒两万公顷的任务。现在，职工们正以昂扬的劳动热情来完成和超额完成自定开荒两万一千九百九十一公顷的计划，争取交给国家更多的良田。在开荒过程中，苏联专家深入田间，具体帮助农场职工逐渐熟悉对农具的调整，学习对各种不同类型的土壤采取不同办法，来提高工作效率。汽车厂制出首批汽车零件
    六月十二日，第一汽车制造厂金属品车间在调整生产中已经生产出第一批汽车零件。产品经检验合格。金属品车间最先调整生产的是单轴自动车床。负责设计这个车间的苏联专家阿基莫夫和厂长都在调整生产前来到现场。　（新华社）
  新疆用飞机探勘石油
    新疆石油公司开始用飞机给探勘潜伏构造的重力和磁力探勘工作定基点。定点飞行工作在六月九日正式开始，将进行到八月。这是我国第一次用飞机配合地球物理探勘队探勘石油。
    新疆石油公司过去在地球物理探勘工作中，由于没有定出基点，往往影响了重力和磁力探勘工作的准确性。今年这个公司决定以一百个小时的飞行时间，在三个月内定出新疆境内石油探勘地区的全部基点。有了这些基点，不仅可以校正过去地球物理探勘的成果，并使今后探勘工作的准确性有了保证，探勘工作的效率也将大大提高。　（新华社）玉门油矿将钻打第一口斜井
    玉门油矿将在老君庙油田新发现的储油层上钻打我国第一口石油斜井。现在，玉门矿务局正在积极拟定施工计划，准备材料，平整井场。
    这个新发现的储油层是老君庙油田的一部分。由于很久以前地层变化，形成断层，这个油层就同现在已经开采的储油层隔开。几年来，我国地质工作人员在苏联专家的帮助下，终于发现了这个油层，并在一九五四年的实际钻探中得到证实。据地质人员初步分析，这个新油层的储油量至少等于老君庙油田已开采油层储油量的十分之一。
    这个新油层的构造很特殊，油层几乎和地面垂直，必须打斜井才能探知整个储油情况。但是打斜井的技术很复杂，用一般钻井方法打斜井要比打直井多花很多时间。苏联钻井专家将帮助玉门油矿工人和技术人员掌握打斜井的技术。整个钻井工程中还将采用先进的苏联涡轮钻具。　（王达）
