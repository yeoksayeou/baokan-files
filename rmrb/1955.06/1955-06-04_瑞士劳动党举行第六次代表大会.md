    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, June 2nd (via TASS) – According to the Swiss newspaper "Vorwärts," the Swiss Party of Labour held its sixth congress from May 28th to 30th. The congress received congratulatory telegrams from eighteen fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties, including those of the Soviet Union and China.

    General Secretary of the Party of Labour, Edgar Woog, delivered a report entitled: "The Swiss Party of Labour fights for peace, unity, and progress." Jean Vincent reported on the parliamentary elections and the Party of Labour's action program.

    The first part of the program elaborates on the international situation and the political situation in Switzerland. The program states that the Swiss Party of Labour advocates that the Swiss state strictly adhere to its policy of neutrality. To this end, it calls for expanding the still insufficient ties with socialist countries and for more actively working to ease international tensions, namely, to ban atomic weapons, destroy existing weapons of mass destruction, and achieve universal disarmament.

    The Swiss Party of Labour demands a reduction in Swiss military spending.

    The Party of Labour puts forward many economic demands and calls for a struggle against rising prices, demanding strict control over prices and rents.

    In its program and its letter to the Swiss people, the Party of Labour calls on all working people to unite in the struggle against capitalist offensives.

    The congress elected a central committee of the party consisting of fifty members. Comrade Edgar Woog was re-elected as General Secretary of the Party.

    "Vorwärts" emphasized that the sixth congress of the Swiss Party of Labour was conducted under the sign of consolidating the unity of working people in the struggle for peace and progress.
