After the reader's letter "The Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station's Blind Management Leads to Serious Waste" was published on the reader's letter page of this newspaper on March 27th, Sun Yonghai, chairman of the afforestation station's trade union (and member of the Party branch committee), Chen Xigui, head of operations, and Wang Yizhen, technical assistant, wrote to state that the reader's criticism was not entirely factual. Shortly thereafter, Zhou Zuohan, director of the Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station, and deputy directors Lin Zhongyuan and Zhang Xiangui wrote to express their "acceptance" of the reader's criticism, but did not propose any improvement measures.

What parts of the reader's criticism were factually incorrect? And what was the attitude of the Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station towards the newspaper's criticism? To clarify these questions, this newspaper asked the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department and the Jilin Daily Reader's Letter Group to assist us in conducting an investigation. The following is a summary of their findings.

×××

The letter from the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department stated: After the reader raised criticisms of the Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station in the "People's Daily," the director of our department immediately instructed the leading personnel of the afforestation station to recognize their errors ideologically and to mobilize the masses to conduct an inspection; at the same time, they were to quickly express their attitude to the Party newspaper. However, the afforestation station did not do so. Instead, they expressed dissatisfaction with the criticism, saying things like "The equipment was transferred by the higher authorities, what does it have to do with the station?" and "How can we afforest without plowing alkaline land?" Some cadres even satirized the letter writer, saying, "You want manuscript fees, we can all chip in a few, but don't do this!" This situation only changed after Director Zhang of the Afforestation Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry went there to inspect the work and criticized this attitude, and the Jilin Daily also sent a reporter to organize a forum. On May 13th and 20th, the afforestation station submitted an explanation and a self-criticism.

According to our understanding, the reader's criticism is basically correct, with only two inaccuracies in the figures (that is, inaccuracies in the calculations during the inspection, because the reader's letter of criticism was based on the inspection report). First, "Last year, of the 127 hectares already afforested, the survival rate was only 36.6 percent." In reality, 117 hectares of the 127 hectares were afforested in the autumn of 1954 and the survival rate would not be determined until 1955. It was incorrect to calculate the survival rate based on the 1953 survival rate of 36.6 percent at that time. Second, "The mechanical utilization rate is approximately 24 percent of the total." This calculation is also inaccurate, because four Stalin 80 tractors were only delivered in late October and should not be fully included in the utilization rate.

However, the Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Station did not recognize the essence of the problem, but instead tried to deny the entire truth by seizing on small details (the issues they raised in the "explanation" regarding land plowing, cost, and the purchase of equipment for the repair shop were all incorrect). They adopted a resistant attitude towards the newspaper's criticism and did not take any improvement measures in their actual work.

The letter from the Jilin Daily Reader's Letter Group stated: After the reader's criticism of the Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station was published in the "People's Daily," it caused a great reaction. Some workers believed that the newspaper's criticism was all correct, and that the actual waste was even more serious than reported in the newspaper. However, some people (mainly some of the leading staff of the station) believed that the criticism in the newspaper was not in accordance with the facts. They were cold and dissatisfied with the letter writer.

What parts of the reader's criticism were not in accordance with the facts? On May 13th, a forum was held at the afforestation station. In addition to those who went to investigate from this newspaper, the participants included Zhang Xiangui, secretary of the Party branch and deputy director of the afforestation station, Sun Yonghai, head of the mechanical department and chairman of the trade union (also a member of the Party branch committee), Li Mingyi, head of the personnel section (a member of the Party branch committee), Li Dizhong, a staff member, and Comrade Cai Daheng from the Ministry of Forestry. Everyone discussed the reader's criticism and the reactions of the comrades in the station item by item. The conclusion was that, except for two inaccuracies in the figures, the spirit, wording, and facts of the reader's criticism were all correct.

×××

The problem is already very clear. So why did some leading staff of the afforestation station still have a resistant attitude after the criticism was published? This is because they believed that the Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station was the first mechanical afforestation station in the country, and that it had achieved certain successes in the past two years. News agencies, newspapers, pictorials, and documentary films had all reported on it, and therefore they developed a sense of pride and complacency, believing that they could only receive praise and not criticism. Therefore, they wanted to seize on individual minor discrepancies in the reader's criticism to deny the entire truth. Therefore, although the newspaper's criticism of the afforestation station had been published for more than two months, they had not organized any study or research for improvement. They forgot that pride and complacency are the most dangerous enemies in ideology, while humility and prudence, adhering to criticism and self-criticism, and constantly correcting shortcomings and errors in work are the characteristics of all revolutionary organs and revolutionary cadres. The Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station should wake up, face up to its shortcomings, and correct its shortcomings. Otherwise, your "national first" cannot be maintained.

### 开通机械造林站应正视自己的缺点

    开通机械造林站应正视自己的缺点
    三月二十七日本报读者来信专页发表了“开通机械造林试验站盲目经营浪费严重”的批评信以后，造林站工会主席（党支部委员）孙永海、业务负责人陈洗贵、技佐王逸真等人来信声明读者的批评有不符实际的地方。不久，开通机械造林试验站主任周作翰、副主任林中元、张相贵三人又来信表示“接受”读者批评，但并未提出任何改进办法。
    究竟读者的批评有哪些不符事实呢？究竟开通机械造林试验站是以什么样的态度来对待报纸的批评的呢？为了弄清这些问题，本报请吉林省林业厅、吉林日报读者来信组帮助我们作了一次调查。现在把他们的调查结果摘要发表于下。
                ×××
    吉林省林业厅的来信：自读者在“人民日报”对开通机械造林试验站提出批评后，我厅厅长即指示造林站领导人员从思想上认识错误，并要发动群众进行检查；同时迅速地向党报表示态度。但造林站并没有这样做，反而对批评表示不满，说什么“设备是上级调来的，与站里有啥关系？”说什么“不翻碱地怎样造林”等等，有些干部甚至对写信的人进行讽刺，说什么“要稿费花，我们大家可给凑几个，可别这么整呵！”这种情况直到林业部造林局张局长到那里去检查工作，对这种态度作了批判，吉林日报社又派记者去组织座谈，才有些转变。五月十三日和二十日造林站才提出了一份说明和检讨。
    根据我们了解，读者的批评基本上是正确的，只有两个数字计算得不准确（即是检查时计算得不准确，因读者批评信是根据检查报告写的），即：第一、“去年已造林的一百二十七公顷中，成活率只占百分之三十六点六”，实际上一百二十七公顷中有一百一十七公顷是一九五四年秋季才造的，必须到一九五五年才能确定成活率，当时都按一九五三年的成活率百分之三十六点六计算是不正确的。第二、“机械利用率约占总数的百分之二十四”，计算得也不准确，因为有四台斯大林八十号拖拉机是在十月下旬才运到的，不应全部打入利用率内。
    但是开通机械造林站没有从本质上来认识问题，而是企图抓住一点否认全部事实（他们在“说明”中提出的翻地问题、成本问题、修理厂设备购置问题，强调的一些原因都是不正确的），并采取抗拒的态度来对待报纸的批评，在实际工作上没有采取任何改进措施。
                ×××
    吉林日报读者来信组来信：读者对开通机械造林试验站的批评在“人民日报”上发表以后，引起了很大的反应。有的工人认为报纸批评的都对，实际浪费比报上登的还要严重；但也有人（主要是一部分站的领导工作人员）认为报上的批评和事实不符，他们对写信人表示冷淡和不满。
    读者对造林站的批评究竟有哪点和事实不符呢？五月十三日在造林站开了一个座谈会，参加的人除本报前去调查的人以外，还有造林站的党支部书记兼副主任张相贵、机务部门负责人兼工会主席孙永海（又是党支部委员）、人事股长李明义（党支部委员）、工作人员李迪忠等和林业部蔡大亨同志。大家就读者的批评和站内同志的反映，进行了逐项的讨论，结论是：读者的批评，除了两个数字有出入外，批评的精神、提法、事实都是正确的。
              ×××
    问题已经很清楚了，那末为什么在批评发表以后，造林站的某些领导工作人员还会存在着抗拒情绪呢？这是由于他们认为开通机械造林试验站是全国第一个机械造林站，在两年来的工作中，取得了一定的成绩，通讯社、报纸、画报社和纪录影片都曾进行过报道，因而滋长了骄傲自满情绪，只能受表扬，不能受批评。因此，他们便想抓住读者批评中个别枝节有出入的地方否认全部事实；因此，虽然报纸对造林站的批评已发表了两个多月，他们并未组织学习和研究改进。他们忘记了骄傲自满是思想上最危险的敌人，而谦虚谨慎，坚持批评和自我批评，不断地纠正工作中的缺点和错误，则是一切革命机关、革命干部的特点。开通机械造林试验站应该清醒过来，正视自己的缺点，改正自己的缺点，否则，你们的“全国第一”是不可能保持下去的。
