British Railway Workers' Strike
　　Hu Sisheng

    British Labour Minister Monckton announced on June 8 that the British government was willing to abandon its original attitude of requiring railway workers to "resume work first, then negotiate," and agreed to hold preliminary talks with workers on the issue of wage increases. This is the initial victory of the British railway workers' strike that began on May 29.
    This nationwide strike of British railway workers is the first nationwide strike of railway workers since the British General Strike of 1926. The main force of railway workers participating in this strike are drivers and stokers. British drivers and stokers are basically divided into two unions: the "Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen," which has 70,000 drivers and stokers, and the "National Union of Railwaymen," which has 17,000 drivers and stokers. The 70,000 drivers and stokers of the "Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen" participated in this strike. Many workers belonging to the "National Union of Railwaymen" also automatically joined the strike. For example, in Scotland, 90 percent of the drivers and stokers belonging to the "National Union of Railwaymen" participated in this strike. Therefore, in the strike, the vast majority of British drivers and stokers stopped working. This brought 90 percent of British railway transport to a standstill.
    At the same time as the British railway workers' strike, the British dockworkers' strike was continuing. The dockworkers' strike began on May 23, and the number of dockworkers participating in the strike gradually increased to more than 20,000, paralyzing major ports such as London, Liverpool, and Manchester, and causing nearly 200 ships to be suspended.
    The reactionary British newspapers are trying their best to conceal the real reasons for the strike, but the obvious fact is that under the British government's pursuit of the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war following the United States, the living conditions of British workers have deteriorated, and they have adopted this means of struggle to support their demands for improved living standards. The June 3 issue of the British "News Chronicle" published an interview by its reporter with Arthur Infield, a 53-year-old striking driver, which provided some illustrative materials:
    "Why are you on strike?" "News Chronicle" reporter asked train driver Infield.
    "Because they refuse to give us a wage that we can barely live on," Infield said. "Don't think we like striking. This is the last resort we have taken after years of futile struggle to increase wages."
    The driver also talked about the harsh working conditions of British railway employees: "Because of the heat, abnormal diet, constant tension and rushing, thousands of train drivers suffer from stomach problems; we work in smoke and soot all day; I often get up at 3:30 in the morning and don't get home until midnight..."
    However, the railway workers' long-term, heavy, and breathless labor has not been exchanged for basic living conditions. Moreover, for a long time, the British government has refused the reasonable demand of railway employees to increase wages. All this cannot but make the workers angry. Therefore, after a long period of negotiations between the representatives of railway workers and the representatives of the government and the British Transport Commission failed to produce results, the strike broke out.
    The demands made by the railway workers in the strike were: an increase of five shillings and sixpence per week for skilled workers and one shilling and sixpence per week for unskilled workers. This kind of demand, judging from the degree of price increase and the value of these amounts in Britain, is not only reasonable, but also very limited. In today's Britain, five shillings and sixpence is roughly equivalent to the price of a box of high-grade cigarettes, and one shilling and sixpence can only buy two cups of coffee. However, even this most basic requirement was unreasonably rejected.
    The British government's stingy attitude towards the railway workers' reasonable demands is in sharp contrast to its courteous care for the railway capitalists. As everyone knows, since the so-called "nationalization" of British railways in 1948, the original owners of the railways have received huge amounts of so-called "compensation fees" every year. In 1954, the "compensation fees" paid to railway owners amounted to 42 million pounds.
    After the railway workers were finally forced to launch a strike, the Conservative government quickly rose up to suppress the strike. British Prime Minister Eden threatened the striking workers in a threatening tone to "resume work first, then negotiate," that is, to unconditionally resume work. After this arrogant demand was rejected by the workers, the British Queen signed an order on May 31 declaring a national emergency in Britain due to the railway workers' strike. Declaring a national emergency is an extraordinary measure to suppress workers, and there have only been two precedents in British history: one was to deal with the national general strike in 1926, and the other was to deal with the dockworkers' strike in 1949. According to this order, the government has broad and unlimited powers to take emergency measures it deems necessary: from requisitioning all means of transport, warehouses, and food to police measures to so-called "prevent the disruption of social order." At the same time, the British authorities transferred thousands of policemen from other parts of the country to London, and used the means of raising police salaries to stimulate their "determination" to suppress the strike. In order to displace the striking workers, thereby splitting the ranks of the striking workers, the British railway authorities announced that they would expel the workers participating in the strike from public dormitories. Many people have been ordered to leave their places of residence. A message revealed in the London newspapers is worth noting: after the Conservative Party won the general election, the British government intended to crack down on the vigorous workers' movement. The message said that the government is drafting a bill to restrict the right of workers to declare strikes.
    However, the railway workers' strike has won widespread sympathy and support from workers across the country. Under the sign of the solidarity of the working class, workers in railway repair factories in various places, miners in South Wales, and dockworkers in the port of Glasgow have stopped working. The Scottish Mineworkers' Union Congress unanimously passed a resolution condemning the government's use of emergency powers to undermine the railway workers' strike and demanding that the British Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party oppose the government's "vicious attack on the democratic rights of trade unions." And when the British Transport Authority attempted to undermine the railway workers' strike by expanding road coal transportation, many trade unions passed resolutions to boycott the method of transporting coal by road. 100,000 miners in South Wales also decided to stop coal mining to protest against the use of cars instead of trains to transport coal. Striking workers receive payments from all sides every day as strike funds. Trade union organizations from various places also telegraphed the striking workers to express their support and condolences. The widespread support from workers across the country is an important source of strength for the striking workers to persist in the strike.
    The right-wing leaders of the British Trades Union Congress and the British Labour Party once again showed in this railway workers' strike that they have abandoned the interests of the working class. The right-wing leaders of the Trades Union Congress carried out so-called "mediation activities" in an attempt to force the striking workers to resume work unconditionally. The Labour Party's newspaper "Daily Herald" not only did not support the striking workers, but expressed regret over the strike, falsely accusing the striking workers of violating "social interests" and echoing the Conservative Party.
    It was only because of the firm fighting spirit of the striking workers and the solidarity shown by British workers towards the railway workers that the Conservative government was forced to withdraw its unreasonable conditions. The decree declaring a national emergency did not frighten the British workers, but the resolute actions of the striking workers frightened the British ruling group. Railway transport plays an important role in the British economy. Under normal circumstances, the railway carries three million passengers and one million tons of goods a day. 80 percent of the coal needed by Britain is transported by rail. Therefore, the railway workers' strike cannot but have a serious impact on the British economy. The British "Financial Times" admitted that the biggest problem caused by the strike was the problem of industrial coal. In fact, many factories have reduced production and shut down. For example, the large-scale steel plate production enterprise "Appleby-Frodingham" announced the suspension of production on the evening of the 6th. Automobile exports have also stagnated. Coal exports have been completely stopped. At the same time, because the produced coal cannot be transported out by rail, the production of coal mines has been reduced by a quarter. In this situation, the British ruling group cannot but consider what consequences its own policies will cause.
    The British railway workers' strike shows that the British working class is increasingly unable to tolerate the cruel exploitation and attacks of British monopoly capital on them. In the past three years of the Conservative Party in power, strikes have developed year by year in terms of lost working days. The number of strikes last year greatly exceeded the average annual number of strikes in the past 20 years. In the first half of this year, workers in many industries in Britain have held strikes, including the printing workers' strike in March and April, which lasted for nearly a month and was the largest in 30 years. These strikes mark a further upsurge in the strike movement. In January this year, Reuters reported that about two million British workers were demanding wage increases. Now, British workers are waging a resolute struggle for their right to live. There is no doubt that the British government's suppression of the British workers' reasonable demands will only cause stronger resistance from the British workers. The British workers' united struggle will achieve more victories.

    英国铁路员工大罢工
    胡思升
    英国劳工大臣蒙克顿在六月八日宣布：英国政府愿意放弃原先要铁路工人们“先复工、后谈判”的态度，而同意先同工人就增加工资问题举行初步谈判。这是从五月二十九日开始的英国铁路员工大罢工的初步胜利。
    这次英国全国铁路员工的大罢工，是自英国一九二六年大罢工以来铁路员工的第一次全国性大罢工。参加这次罢工的是铁路工人的主力——司机和司炉工人。英国的司机司炉工人基本上分属于两个工会：拥有七万司机司炉工人的“机车司机司炉联合工会”和拥有一万七千司机司炉工人的“全国铁路工人工会”。“机车司机司炉联合工会”的七万司机司炉工人参加了这次罢工。“全国铁路工人工会”所属的许多工人也自动地参加了罢工。例如在苏格兰，属于“全国铁路工人工会”的司机司炉工人有百分之九十参加了这一罢工。因此，在罢工中，绝大部分的英国司机司炉工人都停止了工作。这样，就使英国铁路运输的百分之九十陷于停顿。
    在英国铁路工人罢工的同时还有英国码头工人的罢工正在继续。码头工人的罢工是从五月二十三日开始的，参加罢工的码头工人数目逐渐增加到两万以上，瘫痪了伦敦、利物浦、曼彻斯特等大港口，使近二百艘船只停航。
    英国反动报纸竭力掩盖罢工的真正原因，但是明显的事实是：在英国政府追随美国推行扩军备战政策下，英国工人生活境况恶化，他们采取这种斗争手段来支持他们提出的改善生活的要求。六月三日英国“新闻纪事报”发表的该报记者同五十三岁高龄的罢工司机阿图·英费尔德的谈话提供了一些说明性的材料：
    “你为什么罢工？”“新闻纪事报”记者问火车司机英费尔德。
    “因为他们拒绝给我们勉强可以糊口的工资”，英费尔德说，“你不要以为我们喜欢罢工。这是我们在争取提高工资而进行的多年的徒然的斗争后采取的最后手段。”
    这位司机还讲到英国铁路员工恶劣的工作条件：“由于炎热、不正常的饮食、经常的紧张和赶路，成千上万的火车司机都患胃病；我们整天在烟雾和煤灰中工作；我经常早晨三时半起床而在半夜才回家……”。
    但是，铁路工人这种经年累月的繁重的使人喘不过气的劳动并没有换来起码的生活条件。而且长久以来，英国政府一直拒绝铁路员工增加工资的合理要求。这一切不能不使工人愤怒了。于是，在这一次铁路工人代表同政府代表和英国运输委员会的代表经过长时期的谈判得不到结果之后，罢工就爆发了。
    铁路工人在罢工中所提的要求是：熟练工人的每周工资增加五先令六便士，不熟练工人的每周工资增加一先令六便士。这种要求，从物价上涨的程度和这些数目在英国的价值来看，不仅是合理的，而且是很有限的。在现在的英国，五先令六便士大约相当于一盒上等香烟的价格，而一先令六便士只能喝两杯咖啡。但是，即使是这种最起码的要求也被无理拒绝了。
    英国政府对铁路工人的合理要求的吝啬态度和它对铁路资本家的殷勤照顾形成尖锐对照。大家知道，自从一九四八年英国铁路实行所谓“国有化”以来，铁路的原业主每年都获得庞大数目的所谓“补偿费”。在一九五四年，付给铁路业主的“补偿费”就达四千二百万英镑。
    在铁路工人终于被迫发动罢工之后，保守党政府迅速地起来压制罢工。英国首相艾登以威胁的口吻要罢工工人“先复工，后谈判”，即要工人无条件复工。在这个蛮横的要求被工人拒绝之后，英国女王在五月三十一日签署了由于铁路员工罢工而在英国宣布全国紧急状态的命令。宣布全国紧急状态是一种镇压工人的非常措施，在英国历史上只有过两次先例：一次是用来对付一九二六年的全国大罢工，另一次是用来对付一九四九年的码头工人罢工。根据这个命令，政府拥有广泛的和无限的权力，以便采取它认为必要的紧急措施：从征用一切运输工具、仓库、粮食一直到所谓“制止破坏社会秩序”的警察措施。同时，英国当局把几千名警察从其他各地调到伦敦，并用提高警察薪金的手段来刺激他们镇压罢工的“坚决性”。为了使罢工工人流离失所，从而分裂罢工工人的队伍，英国铁路当局宣布，将把参加罢工的工人驱逐出公共宿舍。许多人已被勒令离开居住的地方。伦敦报刊上透露的这样一个消息是值得注意的：在保守党在大选中获胜后，英国政府打算打击蓬勃高涨的工人运动。消息说，政府正在拟定限制工人宣布罢工的权利的法案。
    但是，铁路工人的罢工却得到了全国工人的广泛同情和声援。在工人阶级团结一致的标志下，各地铁路修理工厂的工人、南威尔士的矿工、格拉斯哥港口的码头工人都停止了工作。苏格兰矿工工会大会一致通过决议，谴责政府利用紧急权力破坏铁路工人罢工，并要求英国职工大会和工党反对政府“对工会民主权利的恶毒进攻”。而当英国运输局企图用扩大公路运煤的办法来破坏铁路工人罢工的时候，许多工会通过决议，决定抵制用公路运煤的办法。南威尔士的十万个矿工并决定要停止采煤，以抗议用汽车代替火车运煤。罢工工人每天都接到从各方面寄来的款项，作为罢工的基金。各地工会组织也纷纷打电报给罢工工人表示支持和慰问。全国工人的广泛声援，是罢工工人坚持罢工的重要力量源泉。
    英国职工大会和英国工党的右翼领导在这次铁路员工罢工中又一次表明它们已背弃了工人阶级的利益。职工大会的右翼领袖进行所谓“调解活动”，力图使罢工工人无条件复工。工党机关报“每日先驱报”不但不支持罢工工人，反而对这次罢工表示遗憾，诬蔑罢工工人违反“社会利益”，作保守党的应声虫。
    只是由于罢工工人的坚定斗志和英国工人对铁路工人所表现的团结一致，才迫使保守党政府收回其无理的条件。宣布全国紧急状态的法令没有吓倒英国的工人，而罢工工人的坚决行动倒是吓住了英国统治集团。铁路运输在英国的经济生活中是起着重要作用的。在正常情况下，铁路一天载运三百万旅客和一百万吨货物。英国需要的煤的百分之八十是由铁路运输的。因此，铁路工人的罢工不能不对英国经济产生严重的影响。英国“金融时报”承认罢工引起的最大的问题是工业用煤的问题。实际上，许多工厂已经削减生产和停工。例如生产钢板的“阿普利维—弗隆奇纳”大企业已在六日晚上宣布停止生产。汽车的出口也陷于停滞。煤的出口已全部停止。同时，由于生产出来的煤不能由铁路运输出去，煤矿的生产量减少了四分之一。在这种情况下，英国统治集团不能不考虑到它自己的政策将会造成什么样的后果了。
    英国铁路工人的罢工表明，英国工人阶级已越来越不能容忍英国垄断资本对他们的残酷剥削和进攻。在保守党当政的过去三年中，罢工按所损失的劳动日计算，一年比一年发展。去年罢工的次数大大超过过去二十年平均的每年罢工次数。今年半年来，英国许多行业的工人举行了罢工，其中包括三四月间坚持将近一月，三十年间规模最大的一次印刷工人罢工。这些罢工标志着罢工运动的进一步高涨。今年一月间路透社曾经报道，约有两百万英国工人要求提高工资。现在，英国工人正在为他们的生活权利展开坚决的斗争。不容怀疑，英国政府对英国工人的合理要求的压制只会引起英国工人更强有力的反抗。英国工人团结一致的斗争将取得更多的胜利。
