    Gansu Sends Five Exploration Teams to Search for Coal Mines
    The Gansu Provincial Department of Industry recently dispatched five coalfield exploration teams to areas such as Dingxi and Linxia to explore coal mines. After these exploration teams arrive at their destinations, they will, on the one hand, look for coal resources suitable for the construction of small mines for relevant units; on the other hand, they also plan to look for mineral clues for future detailed exploration. Currently, these exploration teams have begun pit exploration, trench exploration, tunnel exploration, and shallow well exploration in various places. One team in the Qingyang area has discovered coal seams of very good quality near Huan County. (Xinhua News Agency)

    甘肃派五个勘查队寻找煤矿
    甘肃省工业厅最近派出了五个煤田勘查队，前往定西、临夏等地区勘查煤矿。这些勘查队到达目的地以后，一方面要为有关单位寻找一些适合建设小型矿井的煤矿资源；一方面还准备寻找一些可供今后详细勘探的矿产线索。现在，这些勘查队在各地开始了坑探、槽探、巷探和浅井探等工作。在庆阳专区的一个队，已经在环县附近发现煤质很好的煤层。（新华社）
