The Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company's Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company (hereinafter referred to as the Furnace Construction Company), with the help of Soviet experts, has mechanized all aspects of industrial furnace construction except for the bricklaying process.

Prior to 1952, especially before liberation, the transportation of refractory bricks and slurry, the mixing of slurry, and the processing of refractory bricks in furnace construction were all done manually. The quality was poor, production efficiency was low, labor consumption was high, and working conditions were poor. For example, transporting bricks to an eight- or nine-meter-high coking oven involved building crisscrossing scaffolding around it. Workers carried dozens of kilograms of large bricks on their backs, one after another, climbing upwards. After two or three trips, they would feel dizzy, and the bricks carried by the worker in front could easily hit the head of the worker behind. Moreover, loading, unloading, and handing off often chipped the edges of the bricks, affecting the quality and progress of the furnace construction. Refractory brick processing also used double-edged hammers for chopping and chiseling, filling the room with brick dust, which was a terrible working condition and made quality difficult to guarantee. In addition, it was difficult to mix slurry evenly by hand. Carrying slurry in small buckets resulted in spills and waste, and impurities could easily be mixed in along the way, reducing the refractoriness of the slurry. This could lead to iron leaks, steel leaks, or gas leaks after the furnace was built, and all kinds of accidents could occur.

Since the implementation of small-scale mechanized construction, the face of the construction site has changed. Various differently shaped refractory bricks used for bricklaying in iron-smelting furnaces are ground by various different brick-grinding machines. Bricks that are too long or too wide are cut by brick-cutting machines. The processed bricks are transported by train from the refractory material factory to the brick storage at the construction site, and then sent by belt conveyor to the furnace, hundreds of meters away. From there, they are sent to the top of the iron-smelting furnace or hot blast furnace by tipper, and then sent to the bricklayers using roller conveyors or brick chutes. In this way, the furnace builders inside the furnace can get perfectly processed refractory bricks with intact edges that have been sent from afar.

The mixing and transportation of refractory slurry have also been mechanized. The refractory clay in the ash bin is sent by a winch-operated tipper to the mixing machine's container. Clean water is supplied from the tap. Once the motor is turned on, the slurry is mixed well within a few minutes. When the gate is opened, the slurry automatically passes through a sieve and flows into the slurry pumping machine, which pumps it to the slurry storage tank, more than thirty meters above the furnace. When needed, the switch is turned on, and the slurry flows from there through pipes to the furnace builder's slurry trough, ready for the workers to use.

In the coking oven bricklaying site, about ten thousand tons of bricks for two furnaces are also transported entirely by mechanized means. The bricks are loaded from the warehouse onto small trolleys, which are sent along light-duty rails to a hoist tower, and then the winch lifts the trolleys to the furnace and then to the bricklaying site. At the steelmaking furnace bricklaying site, a tipping winch sends old bricks and garbage from the regenerator chamber, several meters deep underground, to one end of a rotating belt, which then sends it to a train to be transported away.

The effects of implementing small-scale mechanized construction are obvious. In the past, building an iron-smelting furnace required 500 people, and processing refractory bricks took about four months. With mechanical processing, only 80 people are needed, and it takes only over two months. Previously, it took 30 people seven days to crush 30 tons of refractory particles manually. Now, with ball mills and crushers, six people can produce 40 tons in two days, increasing efficiency more than twenty times, and also making it possible to utilize old bricks and waste bricks from the construction site, saving costs. When building iron-smelting furnaces, the original requirement was over a hundred workers per shift to transport bricks. After equipping with brick transport machinery and new tools, only twenty or thirty people are needed. Another example is the bottom of the iron-smelting furnace. In the past, it took seven or eight shifts (eight hours per shift) to level each layer of bricks manually. Now, with the furnace bottom leveling machine, one and a half shifts are enough. The construction of more than a dozen layers of the furnace bottom can be completed ten days ahead of schedule, and the quality can also be improved.

Since the establishment of the refractory brick processing plant, the working conditions of the processing workers have also been greatly improved, and many occupational diseases have been eliminated.

In order to further mechanize and factoryize industrial furnace construction, the Furnace Construction Company has established a refractory concrete research group, which is studying the use of concrete pouring to replace bricklaying in parts of furnaces that have particularly complex shapes and lower operating temperatures, or to make refractory concrete into prefabricated components for installation. If the research is successful, it will fundamentally change the manual bricklaying method using block-shaped materials, and ultimately achieve mechanization and factoryization even in the bricklaying process. At the same time, it will also avoid the complicated processes of brick forming, firing, and processing, and simplify the work of transporting and storing materials and semi-finished products. In this way, not only will the project cost be significantly reduced and the project duration shortened, but also conditions will be created for the complete factory construction of the entire furnace construction project. Naturally, to achieve this goal, the staff of the Furnace Construction Company will need to study and research diligently, and conduct serious experiments and research.

    工业筑炉实现了小型施工机械化
    夏启明　陈耀武
    鞍山钢铁建设公司工业筑炉工程公司（以下简称筑炉公司）在苏联专家帮助下，使工业筑炉的施工除砌砖工序外，全部实现了机械化。
    一九五二年以前，尤其是解放以前，筑炉施工中的耐火砖、泥浆的运输，泥浆的搅拌，耐火砖的加工等都是用手工操作的，质量不好、生产效率低、劳动力消耗大而且劳动条件不好。例如运砖，八、九公尺高的炼焦炉，四周搭上交叉的跳板；工人背着几十公斤重的大块砖一个跟着一个地往上走。走两三趟，就会感到昏沉沉，前面工人背的砖也很容易撞到后面工人的头上；而且装卸递放经常撞掉砖的棱角，影响了砌炉的质量和进度。耐火砖加工也用双刃锤砍敲凿，满屋子都是砖粉，劳动条件很坏，质量也难保证。此外，用人工搅拌泥浆也很难均匀；用手提小灰桶运泥浆易泼易撒，浪费较多，在中途还容易混入杂物，降低泥浆耐火度，砌上炉子漏铁、漏钢、跑煤气，什么事故都可能发生。
    自从实行了小型机械化施工以后，工地的面貌就变了样。炼铁炉砌砖用的各种不同形状的耐火砖由各种不同的磨砖机磨成。太长、太宽的砖由切砖机来切。加工好的砖由耐火材料厂用火车运到工地砖库，再由砖库用皮带运输机送到几百公尺远的炉子旁边，再用翻斗机送上炼铁炉或热风炉炉顶，用辊道或滑砖槽送到工人砌砖的地方。这样，筑炉工人在炉内就可以拿到从远处送来棱角完整、加工完善的耐火砖。
    耐火泥浆的搅拌和运输也实行机械化了。灰库内的耐火泥灰由卷扬小翻斗送到搅拌机的箱里，自来水管送来清洁的水，马达一转动，几分钟内泥浆就搅拌好了。闸门一开，泥浆就自动通过筛子流入泥浆压送机，被压到三十多公尺炉上的盛泥浆箱内。需用时将开关打开，泥浆就从那里由管子流到筑炉工的泥浆槽里，只等工人使用了。
    在炼焦炉砌砖工地上的两个炉子约一万多吨砖，也完全采用机械化运输。砖由仓内装上小推车，通过轻便轨道，送上卷扬塔，然后由卷扬机把小推车升到炉上，再送到砌砖地点去。在炼钢炉砌砖工地，翻斗卷扬机从地下几公尺深的蓄热室内，把旧砖和垃圾送到转动的皮带的一端，就会将它送到火车上运走。
    实行小型施工机械化后的效果是很明显的。过去砌筑一座炼铁炉要五百人，加工耐火砖要费时四个月左右，用机械加工后，只要八十个人花两个多月时间就够了。以前由人工捣碎耐火颗粒，三十人做七天才捣出三十吨，现在用球磨机和粉碎机，六个人两天就生产四十吨。提高效率二十几倍，还能利用工地旧砖、废砖，节约费用。炼铁炉砌砖施工时原来每班需要上百个工人运砖，装备了运砖机械和新工具后，只需要二、三十人就够了。又如炼铁炉炉底，以前砌完一层砖后用人工铲平就要七、八个班（一班八小时），现在用炉底铲平机一班半就够了，十几层炉底就可提前工期十来天完工，质量还可以提高。
    自从有了耐火砖加工厂后，加工工人的劳动条件也大大改善了，免除了很多职业病。
    为了使工业筑炉工程进一步机械化和工厂化，筑炉公司成立了耐火混凝土研究小组，正在研究用浇灌混凝土的办法来代替炉子某些构形特别复杂而工作温度不太高的部分的砌砖，或者将耐火混凝土做成预制件用安装办法来施工。研究成功后，将从根本上改变用块形材料人工砌筑的手工业方式，并最后在砌砖这一工序上也做到机械化和工厂化。同时还将会避免砖的成型、焙烧、加工等繁复过程，而运输、保管材料、半制品等工作也将简化。这样，不只将显著降低工程成本、缩短工程期限，而且将为整个筑炉工程彻底工厂化施工创造条件。自然，要达到这一目的，还需要筑炉公司职工认真学习、钻研，认真去试验和研究。
