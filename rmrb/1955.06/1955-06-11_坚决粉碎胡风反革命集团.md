    Resolutely Crush the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
    Mǎ Xùlún
    After reading the three batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng clique's counter-revolutionary conspiracy, I couldn't contain my inner anger. I completely agree with thoroughly exposing and settling accounts for the Hu Feng clique's crimes of being anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary, removing Hu Feng and other principal culprits from all positions in state organs and other work departments, and punishing them according to the law.
    Now, the facts are very clear: the Hu Feng clique's reactionary nature is not only in ideological terms, but more seriously in political activities. The Hu Feng clique is a complete enemy of the people, standing on the side of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. For twenty years, they have consistently engaged in sinful anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. Hu Feng and many core members of the Hu Feng clique had close ties with imperialist Kuomintang secret service organs long ago. They have always held an extremely hostile attitude towards the revolution. They regarded the people's revolutionary forces as "pus" and "feudal potential." They cursed the Chinese People's Liberation Army as "communist bandits" and "bandit troops." They shamelessly promoted Chiang Kai-shek's military forces. After liberation, not only did they show no remorse, but they even more exploited their "progressive" disguise, employed their double-dealing tactics, made a desperate struggle, secretly and systematically organized their followers to infiltrate the Party, the military, state organs, and various revolutionary organizations, establish strongholds, and expand their strength to carry out various counter-revolutionary activities. Even after their frenzied attack failed, they continued to play double-dealing tactics, attempting to use false self-criticism to cover up their temporary retreat, "seeking rebirth in endurance," and pinning their hopes on the restoration of the Kuomintang reactionary regime. This kind of counter-revolutionary conspiracy is extremely vicious.
    The people's waiting and patience are limited. We will never allow incorrigible counter-revolutionaries to remain at large for a long time, and we will never allow those wolves to continue to wear sheep's clothing, continue to mix among the people, and carry out sinful anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities.
    All members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, together with the people of the whole country, are determined to fully learn from the facts of the Hu Feng clique's conspiracy, strive to study dialectical materialism, and draw a clear line between ourselves and bourgeois idealist thought; at the same time, maintain a high degree of vigilance and wage a resolute struggle against all disguised revolutionaries who are actually hidden counter-revolutionaries. We fully understand: "If the enemy does not surrender, we will resolutely eliminate them!"

    坚决粉碎胡风反革命集团
    马叙伦
    我看了胡风集团的三批反革命阴谋材料以后，无法遏止内心的愤怒。我完全同意彻底揭露和清算胡风集团反党反人民反革命的罪行，撤销胡风等首恶分子在国家机关和其他工作部门内的一切职务，并依法惩办。
    现在，事实非常清楚，胡风集团的反动不只在思想方面，更严重的是在政治活动方面，胡风集团是十足的站在帝国主义和蒋介石一边的人民公敌。二十年来，他们一贯进行反党反人民反革命的罪恶活动，胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子很早以前就和帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切联系，他们对革命一贯抱着极端仇视的态度，他们把人民革命力量看做是“脓”，看做是“封建潜力”，他们咒骂中国人民解放军是“共匪”，“匪军”，他们无耻地替蒋贼军事势力鼓吹，他们在解放以后不但毫无悔改，反而更加利用了他的“进步”伪装，施展他们的两面派手法，作垂死的挣扎，秘密地有计划地组织他的党羽打入党内、军内、国家机关和各种革命团体内，建立据点，扩充实力，来进行各种反革命活动。就在他的猖狂进攻失败之后，还继续玩弄两面派手法，企图用假检讨掩护他的暂时退却，“在忍受中求得重生”，把希望寄托在国民党反动政权的复辟上。这种反革命的阴谋活动是非常恶毒的。
    人民的等待和忍耐是有限度的，我们决不容许怙恶不悛的反革命分子长期逍遥法外，决不容许那些恶狼仍然披着羊皮，继续混在人民内部，进行反党反人民反革命的罪恶活动。
    中国民主促进会全体会员，坚决和全国人民一道，从胡风集团的阴谋活动这一事实中充分吸取教训，努力学习辩证唯物主义，同资产阶级唯心主义思想划清界限；同时保持高度警惕性，同一切伪装革命而实际是反革命的暗藏分子作坚决的斗争。我们完全懂得：“敌人不投降，就坚决地消灭它！”
