Everyone Must Search Every Dark Corner
    Zheng Zhenduo
    I only knew Hu Feng by sight, nodding or shaking hands when we met. I didn't understand his situation at all. I just felt that the person was a bit "阴" (yin, meaning shady or sinister), as if his stomach was full of ghosts, and he was difficult to deal with, so I always kept a respectful distance. Last winter, at the joint expanded meeting of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers Association Presidium, I was surprised to hear Hu Feng and Lu Ling's entire day and a half of "accusations" or "attacks": where did they get so many complaints and so much resentment! This March, when I returned to China from India and Burma, I heard that Hu Feng was writing a "self-criticism." The "People's Daily" on May 13 published Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" and Shu Wu's materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, which made me feel that Hu Feng's problem was not simple. Why would he think so fiercely of "using a whip wrapped in rubber-coated steel wire to beat prisoners" to beat our party's and non-party progressive writers—he said this when Kuomintang secret agents were "using a whip wrapped in rubber-coated steel wire to beat prisoners" and brutally torturing revolutionaries in 1945—? Why did he slander and insult all party and non-party progressive writers so much? It wasn't until the "People's Daily" published the second batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique on May 24 that I understood: how viciously Hu Feng and his clique slandered the Party, the Party's literary and art policies, and the Party's responsible comrades; how they cursed the Party member writers and non-Party writers in the literary and art circles; how they planned and organized secret anti-Party and anti-people criminal activities; and how they implemented the "Sun Wukong entering the belly" tactic to infiltrate the Party, to find out information and steal Party documents, and expand their strength. I also understood why he and his followers launched such a frenzied large-scale attack at the joint expanded meeting of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers Association Presidium! After the attack failed, why did they make a false self-criticism? It turned out that they wanted to "seek rebirth in suffering," to lie dormant and wait for an opportunity to rise again. This is no longer a debate about literary and artistic ideas, and it is no longer a simple question of how to thoroughly eliminate the remnants of various idealistic thoughts. The publication of these conclusive anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary materials made us understand that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique had other backgrounds. It turned out that Hu Feng and many core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique had long been loyal lackeys of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. They had close ties with the imperialist Kuomintang secret service agencies and had been disguising themselves as revolutionaries and lurking in the revolutionary progressive ranks for a long time, engaging in counter-revolutionary espionage work.

    Hu Feng and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique had been lurking in the revolutionary ranks for a long time, carrying out counter-revolutionary conspiracies and engaging in many rumor-mongering and divisive tricks. Now that the truth is out, many people look back and suddenly realize: why they seized on every event and launched cruel and merciless attacks and slanders against every progressive writer. It turns out that their "whip wrapped in rubber-coated steel wire" was exactly the same whip that Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents used to brutally kill revolutionaries.

    The people of the whole country express great anger at these wolf-hearted and dog-lunged counter-revolutionaries; especially those in the literary and art circles who have suffered from them, their anger is even deeper! The people of the whole country unanimously demand the thorough elimination of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and demand that these lurking counter-revolutionaries be dealt with according to law.

    The more victorious the revolution advances, the more rampant and insidious the activities of counter-revolutionaries become. The more successful socialist construction is, the more domestic and foreign enemies will try to sabotage and obstruct it. The most feared thing is complacency and a peaceful mentality. The activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique are a clear example. Hu Feng had been lurking in the revolutionary ranks for more than twenty years, saying all the bad things and doing all the bad things. We were not without suspicion of him, nor were we without struggle, but we always thought it was a matter of education and persuasion, a matter of literary and artistic ideas. From now on, we can no longer be complacent! We must be highly vigilant and have a keen sense of smell. As the saying goes, "It is easy to dodge a spear in the open, but difficult to guard against an arrow in the dark." In dark corners, there may be counter-revolutionary secret agents hiding, giving you a surprise sabotage. The enemies of the class, including domestic and foreign ones, will not be reconciled to failure, but will struggle to the death, filled with vicious curses and hatred. We must be careful not to be splashed by their poisonous water.

    Everyone must search every dark corner, illuminate every dirty place with sunlight, and expose all hidden counter-revolutionaries, including members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, so that they can be judged by the people as they deserve.

    人人要搜索每一个阴暗的角落
    郑振铎
    我同胡风只是认识，见面时点点头，或握握手，一点也不了解他的情况，只是觉得那个人有点“阴”，仿佛满肚子里是鬼，不好打交道，一直是“敬而远之”。去年冬天，在文联和作协主席团联席扩大会议上，听到胡风和路翎的整整一天半的“控诉”或“攻击”，我就觉得很诧异：他们哪里来的那末多的牢骚，那末大的怨愤！今年三月里，从印度、缅甸回国，就听见说胡风在写“检讨”了。五月十三日的“人民日报”登载了胡风的“我的自我批判”和舒芜的关于胡风反革命集团的一些材料，才使我感到胡风的问题不简单。为什么要那末凶狠地想到“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”打我们的党的和非党的进步作家——他说这话的时候，乃是一九四五年国民党特务正在“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”毒打革命者们的时候——呢？为什么要对所有党和非党的进步作家们那末污蔑辱骂呢？到了五月二十四日“人民日报”发表了关于胡风反革命集团的第二批材料，我才明白了：胡风和他的集团如何恶毒地污蔑党、污蔑党的文艺方针，污蔑党的负责同志，咒骂文艺界的党员作家和党外作家；如何有计划地、有组织地秘密进行反党反人民的罪恶活动，如何实行“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”打进党的内部，来探听情况和盗窃党内文件，扩充实力；也明白了，他和他的党徒为什么要在文联和作协的主席团联席扩大会议上那样猖狂的大举进攻！在进攻失败了以后，为什么要做假检讨？原来是要“在忍受中求得重生”，要潜伏下来，伺机再起。这已完全不是文艺思想问题的论争，已完全不是简单的如何彻底肃清各种唯心主义思想的残余的问题了。这些真凭实据的反党、反人民、反革命的材料的发表，使我们明白胡风反革命集团是别有背景的。原来胡风和胡风反革命集团中的许多骨干分子很早以来就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，他们同帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切联系，长期地伪装革命潜伏在革命的进步的队伍里，干着反革命的特务工作。
    胡风和胡风反革命集团长期潜伏在革命队伍里进行反革命的阴谋活动，干了多少造谣中伤的勾当和挑拨离间的鬼把戏。如今真相大白，许多人回头一想便都恍然大悟起来：为什么他们是那样地抓住每一件事，对每一个进步的作家，进行残酷无情的攻击和污蔑。原来他们的那条“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”，却正是蒋介石特务分子用来残杀革命者的同一条的鞭子。
    全国人民都对这些狼心狗肺的反革命分子表示极大的愤怒；特别是身受其苦的文艺界的人士们，愤激之情更为深切！全国人民都一致要求彻底消灭胡风反革命集团，要求依法处理这些潜伏的反革命分子。
    革命越胜利前进，反革命分子的活动就越加猖狂和阴险。社会主义建设越成功，国内外的敌人就越要加以破坏和阻挠。最怕是麻痹大意，有太平思想。胡风反革命集团的活动就是一个明显的例子。胡风潜伏在革命队伍里二十多年，坏话说尽，坏事做尽，我们对他不是没有怀疑，也不是没有斗争，但总以为是教育、说服的工作，是文艺思想上的问题。今后我们再也麻痹大意不得了！警惕性要高，嗅觉要敏锐。俗语说的好：“明枪易躲，暗箭难防。”在阴暗的角落里，就可能躲藏着反革命特务分子，给你来个冷不防的破坏。阶级的敌人，包括国内的和国外的，是不会甘心于失败的，是要临死挣扎的，是充满了恶毒的诅咒和憎恨的。我们要当心被他们的毒水所溅伤。
    人人要搜索每一个阴暗的角落，要使太阳光照亮每一个藏垢纳污的地方，把所有的暗藏的反革命分子，包括胡风反革命集团的分子在内，揭露出来，使他们受到应有的人民的裁判。
