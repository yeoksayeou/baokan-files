    Sino-Soviet Children's Art Exhibition Opens

    (Our Newspaper) News: From June 1st (International Children's Day) to the 15th, the "Sino-Soviet Children's Art Exhibition" will be held at the "Children's Home" in Beihai Park, Beijing.

    The National Committee for the Defence of Children of the Chinese People, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the Chinese Artists Association jointly sponsored this exhibition to further develop children's art activities and strengthen the friendship between Chinese and Soviet children.

    More than 3,000 works from all over the country were submitted to this exhibition, including works from cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Lushun-Dalian, Shenyang, Harbin, Xi'an, Chongqing, and Chengdu, as well as counties such as Qiyang in Hunan Province and Ya'an in Xikang Province. After evaluation, 146 pieces were officially exhibited. The majority of the authors are students from kindergartens, primary schools, and junior high schools, with a few children who have not yet started school. The youngest is four years old, and the oldest is seventeen years old.

    Thirty-nine works by Soviet children are participating in the exhibition.

    From these innocent and lovely drawings by Chinese and Soviet children, it can be seen that although the living habits of the two peoples are somewhat different, the living standards are not the same, and the influence of national art traditions and appreciation habits on children's art creation is also significantly different, they all reflect the happy and joyful life under the new social system as seen from their perspectives, and reflect their love for the motherland, love for labor, love for peace, and their healthy and lively spirit.

    中苏少年儿童图画展览会开幕
    本报讯　六月一日（国际儿童节）起至十五日止，在首都北海公园内“少年之家”，将举行“中苏少年儿童图画展览会”。
    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会、中华人民共和国教育部、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中国美术家协会，为了进一步开展少年儿童的美术活动和加强中苏儿童的友谊，联合主办这次展览会。
    全国各地应征参加这次展览的作品有三千多件，出品地区包括北京、上海、南京、杭州、济南、武汉、广州、长沙、旅大、沈阳、哈尔滨、西安、重庆、成都等城市和湖南省的祁阳、西康省的雅安等县。作品经过评选后正式展出的有一百四十六件。作者绝大部分都是幼儿园、小学和初中的学生，也有个别尚未上学的儿童，年龄最小的四岁，最大的十七岁。
    苏联小朋友的作品，参加展出的有三十九件。
    从这些天真可爱的中苏小朋友所描绘的图画中可以看出，虽然两国人民的生活习惯有所不同，生活水平也不一样，民族的美术传统和欣赏习惯所给予儿童美术创作上的影响也有显著的区别，但是它们同样反映了从他们的角度看到的新的社会制度下幸福愉快的生活，反映了他们热爱祖国、热爱劳动、热爱和平的情绪和健康活泼的精神。
