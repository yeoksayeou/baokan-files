    United States Forces Philippine Economy into Subordination to the United States
    According to Manila news, Philippine Senator Recto opposed the foreign investment bill proposed by the Philippine government, believing it to be a "new American plan aimed at hindering the economic development of the Philippines." The news said that Recto's opposition to this bill reflects the majority opinion of the Philippine Congress. Recto said that the United States' policy toward the Philippines is to make the Philippine economy subordinate to the American economy.
    Speaking about a land rent bill submitted to the Philippine Congress, Recto pointed out that this bill is a "shameful product" of the American Embassy and officials from the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration. If this land rent bill were to be passed, the Philippines would continue to be a source of raw materials and a sales market for foreign goods.
      U.S. Coup Conspiracy in Chile Uncovered
    According to a United Press reporter, Chile has uncovered a military conspiracy aimed at dissolving parliament and establishing a military dictatorship. General Alfonso Cañas Luis, leader of the Chilean Military Academy, General Ramon Salinas, former leader of the academy, and Raul Silva, former chief of staff of the Santiago garrison, have been arrested.
    Progressive Chilean newspapers had long warned of a conspiracy being plotted. The April issue of "Visitaso" magazine wrote that a group of officers at the Military Academy had established an underground organization in the Chilean army with the aim of establishing a dictatorship in Chile like the Jiménez government in Venezuela. It is speculated that after such a dictatorship was established, it would reach a "mutual understanding" with the United States.
    The conspirators' actions were opposed by domestic democrats. Rallies and meetings were held across the country to support the "People's Front." Due to these actions by the Chilean working people and the entire Chilean people, the conspiracy has been exposed. The planners of the conspiracy have been arrested.
      British Troops Invade Saudi Arabia, Killing Many Residents
    Egyptian newspapers "Al-Ahram" and "Al-Gomhuria" reported the news of British troops violating the border of Saudi Arabia.
    The newspapers said that British troops departing from British bases near the Buraimi Oasis invaded Saudi Arabian territory and occupied the Ibri region of the Sultanate of Oman. A column of British troops trampled crops in the fields and destroyed villages during their march. Armed conflicts broke out between local residents trying to protect their property and British soldiers, resulting in thirty-seven Arabs being killed.
      British Colonialists in Kenya and Malaya
    According to Nairobi news, starting from May 21st, large numbers of British colonial military police launched a major offensive against Kenyan patriots in the jungles. Since the British colonial authorities declared a "state of emergency" in Kenya in October 1952, more than eight thousand black people have been killed, and sixty thousand people have suffered in concentration camps.
    The British government allocates large sums of money every year to carry out colonial wars to massacre colonial people. The war in Kenya costs 12 million pounds a year, and the war in Malaya costs 98 million pounds a year. In Malaya, 650,000 people have been imprisoned in concentration camps.
    "World News" used figures to demonstrate the economic aims of British colonialism in cruelly suppressing colonial people: despite the decline in world rubber prices, six British rubber companies extracted more than 9 million pounds in net profit from colonial people between 1950 and 1953. In Kenya, three thousand colonists occupy 16,700 square miles of the most fertile land, while 5.5 million black people have only 50,000 square miles of the worst land.
      French Authorities Continue to Suppress the Algerian People
    The French authorities continue to send troops to Algeria to suppress the increasingly large-scale national liberation movement there. After the French cabinet meeting on May 24th to discuss the situation in Algeria, French Prime Minister Faure announced at a press conference on the 26th that France would transfer another division from the French troops already assigned to NATO to Algeria.
    According to Agence France-Presse, French Marshal Juin, who hurriedly traveled from France to Algeria, gave a speech in Algiers on May 29th, confirming that the French government is rushing reinforcements to Algeria, including troops transferred from Indochina.
    A reporter from "Al-Qahira" pointed out that these repressive measures by the French government are being taken with the participation of the United States, and the Americans have reached agreements with the French authorities in many places in North Africa.
      Cameroonian People Protest the French Authorities' Brutal Suppression
    According to French newspapers, recently, in the French-administered area of Cameroon in French Equatorial Africa, bloody clashes occurred between local residents and police.
    The clashes started on May 22nd in Mbenga (bordering British Cameroon) and quickly spread to major Cameroonian cities such as Yaoundé, Douala, and Edea.
    On May 26th, in Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, three people were killed and forty were injured. On the 27th, residents of the city held a demonstration. Police clashed with the demonstrators, resulting in two Cameroonians being killed and eighteen injured.
    The French colonial authorities immediately dispatched troops and gendarmes to various parts of Cameroon, declared martial law in many places, and carried out mass arrests, primarily arresting members of the Cameroonian People's Union, a democratic organization fighting for the national liberation of Cameroon.

    反对殖民主义，争取民族独立和自由
    美国迫使菲律宾的经济从属于美国
    据马尼拉消息，菲律宾参议员雷克托反对菲律宾政府提出的关于外国投资的法案，认为这是一个“目的在于阻碍菲律宾经济发展的美国新计划”。消息说，雷克托对这个法案的反对态度，反映了菲律宾国会多数的意见。雷克托说，美国对菲律宾的政策是，使菲律宾的经济从属于美国的经济。
    雷克托就提交菲律宾国会的一项地租法案发表谈话时指出，这个法案是美国大使馆和美国援外事务管理署官员们的“可耻的产品”。这一地租法案如果竟然被通过，菲律宾就将继续成为原料供应地和外国货物的销售市场。
      美国在智利的政变阴谋案被破获
    据合众社记者报道，智利破获了一件目的在解散议会和建立军事独裁的军事阴谋案件。智利军事学院领导者阿方索·卡尼亚斯·路易斯将军、这个学院的前领导者拉蒙·萨利纳斯将军和前圣地亚哥卫戍军参谋长劳尔·西尔瓦已经被逮捕。
    智利进步报刊老早就曾提出警告，说有人在策划阴谋。四月号的“维斯塔索”杂志写道，军事学院的一批军官在智利军队中建立了一个地下组织，其目的是要在智利建立像委内瑞拉的希门尼斯政府一样的独裁政府。据推测，这样的独裁政府建立以后，就要同美国取得“互相谅解”。
    阴谋者的行动遭到了国内民主人士的反对。全国各地都举行大会和会议，支持“人民阵线”。由于智利劳动人民和全体智利人民的这些行动，阴谋案已被揭穿。阴谋的策划者已被逮捕。
      英军侵入沙特阿拉伯打死很多居民
    埃及“金字塔报”和“共和国报”报道了英国军队侵犯沙特阿拉伯国境的消息。
    报纸说，从布赖米绿洲附近的英国基地出发的英国军队，侵入了沙特阿拉伯的领土，并且占领了阿曼酋长国的伊布里地区。英国军队的一个纵队在行军中践踏了田地里的庄稼并破坏了村庄。想要保护自己财产的当地居民和英国士兵之间发生了武装冲突，结果有三十七个阿拉伯人被打死。
      英国殖民主义者在怯尼亚和马来亚
    据内罗毕消息，英国大批殖民军警从五月二十一日开始，向在丛林中的怯尼亚爱国者大举进攻。自从一九五二年十月英国殖民当局在怯尼亚宣布进入“紧急状态”以来，已经有八千多名黑人遭到了杀害，有六万人在集中营受苦。
    英国政府每年都要拨出大笔款项来进行屠杀殖民地人民的殖民战争。怯尼亚的战争每年耗费一千二百万英镑，马来亚的战争每年耗费九千八百万英镑。在马来亚，被关进集中营的有六十五万人。
    “世界新闻”以数字表明了英国殖民主义在残酷镇压殖民地人民的经济目的：尽管橡胶的世界价格是下跌的，六家英国橡胶公司在一九五○年到一九五三年间还是从殖民地人民身上榨取了九百万英镑以上的纯利。在怯尼亚，三千名殖民者占有一万六千七百平方英里的最肥沃的土地，而五百五十万黑人一共只有五万平方英里的最坏的土地。
      法国当局继续镇压阿尔及利亚人民
    法国当局继续派兵到阿尔及利亚去镇压当地声势日益浩大的民族解放运动。在法国内阁五月二十四日举行会议讨论了阿尔及利亚局势后，法国总理富尔二十六日在记者招待会上宣布，法国要再从已经拨归北大西洋公约组织指挥的法国部队中调一师人到阿尔及利亚去。
    据法新社消息，匆匆从法国赶到阿尔及利亚去的法国元帅许温五月二十九日在阿尔及尔发表演说，证实了法国政府正在赶紧往阿尔及利亚调遣增援部队，其中包括从印度支那调来的军队。
    “开罗报”记者指出，法国政府的这些镇压措施是在美国的参与之下采取的，美国人在北非的许多地方和法国当局取得了协议。
      喀麦隆人民抗议法国当局的残酷镇压
    据法国报纸报道，最近，在赤道非洲法国托管地区喀麦隆，当地的居民和警察发生了流血冲突。
    冲突是五月二十二日在姆本加（同英属喀麦隆接壤）开始的，很快就发展到了雅温得、杜阿拉、埃德亚等喀麦隆的主要城市。
    五月二十六日在喀麦隆首都雅温得，有三个人被打死，四十个人受伤。二十七日，这个城市中居民举行了游行示威。警察同示威游行者发生了冲突，结果两个喀麦隆人被打死，十八人受伤。
    法国殖民当局立即调遣军队和宪兵到喀麦隆各地，并在许多地方宣布了戒严，大肆逮捕，首先是逮捕正在为喀麦隆的民族解放而斗争的民主组织喀麦隆人民联盟的盟员。          （据新华社讯）
