Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The Building Engineering Department Design Bureau has recently formulated technical measures to modify current designs. After these measures are implemented, civil building projects that begin construction in June and July can meet or fall below the cost reduction targets set by the central government without changing the original building structure. The Design Bureau and construction units designed three-story dormitory buildings for three units in Luoyang. According to the above-mentioned partial measures, a revised design plan was made, which resulted in a cost reduction of more than 15.5 yuan per square meter of construction area (excluding off-site engineering), a reduction of 26.65 percent from the originally stipulated cost, and below the cost reduction target set by the central government.

A large number of projects will start construction in various places in June and July this year. The projects started or about to be started by the Building Engineering Department alone in these two months amount to about 900,000 square meters. Therefore, before the national civil building standard design is completed at the end of July, formulating technical measures to modify the designs of these projects that have already started or are about to start construction can ensure that the cost of these projects can also be reduced to the targets set by the central government, saving a large amount of funds for the country.

When formulating these measures, the Design Bureau formulated 78 cost reduction methods for parts or equipment such as doors and windows, interior and exterior plastering, brick walls, floors, roofs, ceilings, heating, electricity, fire protection, floor heights, kitchens, toilets, sanitary equipment, and other parts of the project or equipment, where past building standards were too high. For example, in the door and window section, eliminating decorations, window sills, screens, curtain rods, and curtain boxes, changing the uppermost piece of glass in the interior door to a ventilation panel, changing the door lock to a "bolt," using wooden handles instead of iron handles on windows, and using tung oil instead of paint are fifteen ways to save money that can greatly reduce costs.

The person in charge of the Design Bureau said: Because the construction progress and original design standards of many projects are different, the measures currently formulated may not be fully applicable to all projects, but as long as some of these measures are adopted according to the specific situation, a lot of funds can also be saved. In the revised plan for the dormitory buildings designed by the Design Bureau for three units in Luoyang, only 30 of the 78 saving methods and other measures were adopted, and the cost was reduced by more than 26 percent. In the interior and exterior wall plastering section, only four of the six saving methods were adopted, such as canceling interior and exterior decorations, and the cost per square meter of construction area was reduced by more than 1.1 yuan. Only four of the sixteen saving methods for door and window projects were adopted, and the cost per square meter was reduced by more than 2.8 yuan.

The measures of the Design Bureau are formulated based on the principles of economy, applicability, and simplicity. They stipulate that when adopting these measures, all regions should make full use of local building materials within the scope of the newly stipulated cost, and refer to the experience of local residential buildings, absorb excellent structural methods and characteristics, to achieve the purpose of saving construction costs.

### 建筑工程部设计总局制定技术措施  降低民用建筑工程造价的指标

    建筑工程部设计总局制定技术措施
    降低民用建筑工程造价的指标
    新华社二十九日讯　建筑工程部设计总局最近制定了修改当前设计的技术措施。这些措施实现后，可以使六七月间开工的民用建筑工程不改变原来的建筑结构，就能达到或低于中央规定的降低造价的指标。设计总局和修建单位为洛阳三个单位设计的三层楼房宿舍，根据上述的部分措施作出了修改设计的计划，结果使每平方公尺建筑面积（不包括宅外工程）的造价降低了十五元五角多，比原来规定的造价降低了百分之二十六点六五。并低于中央规定的降低造价的指标。
    今年六七月间，各地有大量的工程开工。只是建筑工程部在这两个月开工或将要开工的工程，就有九十万平方公尺左右。因此，全国的民用建筑标准设计在七月底没有作出以前，制定修改这些已经开工或快要开工工程设计的技术措施，就可以保证这些工程的造价同样能够降低到中央规定的指标，为国家节约大量资金。
    设计总局制定这些措施时，对过去建筑标准太高的门窗、室内外粉刷、砖墙、地面、屋顶、天棚、采暖、电气、消防、楼层高度、厨房、厕所、卫生设备和其它部分工程或设备等，分别制定了七十八条降低造价的办法。例如门窗部分，取消花饰、窗台板、纱窗、窗帘棍子和窗帘盒，将内门最上边的一块玻璃改为通风板，门锁改为“划子”，窗上用木拉手代替铁拉手，用桐油代替油漆等十五条节约办法，就可降低造价很多。
    设计总局的负责人说：许多工程由于施工进度和原设计标准不同，现在制定的这些措施，不一定全部适用各个工程，但只要根据具体情况，采用其中一部分措施，也同样可以节约很多资金。设计总局为洛阳三个单位设计的楼房宿舍的修改计划中，只采用了七十八条节约办法中的三十条和另外的一些措施，就降低了百分之二十六以上的造价；室内室外墙壁粉刷部分的六条节约办法，只采取其中取消内外装饰等四条办法，每平方公尺建筑面积的造价就降低了一点一元多；门窗工程的十六条节约办法中也只采用了四项，每平方公尺造价就降低了二点八元多。
    设计总局的这些措施，是根据节约、适用和朴实的原则制定的。他们规定各地采用这些措施时，在不超出新规定的造价范围内，应尽量利用地方性的建筑材料，并参照当地建筑民房的经验，吸取优良的结构方法和特点，达到节约建筑造价的目的。
