Eliminating Counter-Revolutionaries is the Duty of Every Patriot
Chen Yi

The third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has been published! After reading these materials, I think those who said it was "making a mountain out of a molehill," "just a matter of literary and ideological differences," "a problem of the cultural departments," "a dispute between a few cultural figures," etc., will be even more surprised.

What exactly is the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique? The facts are already clear. As the "People's Daily" editorial on June 10 pointed out: "Imperialist Kuomintang special agents, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and turncoats are the basic backbone of this group."

There is nothing more reliable than the words spoken by these counter-revolutionaries themselves. A Long – Chen Yimen, a member from Hu Zongnan's "War Cadre Fourth Regiment," an instructor at the Chongqing Shandong Army University. Just looking at these titles is enough to understand. Anyone with a little experience in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries, or even someone who is a little concerned about current affairs, knows what kind of guy Hu Zongnan was, what kind of organization the "War Cadre Fourth Regiment" was, and what kind of people could enter the Army University. It is clear that A Long was not an ordinary figure in the Kuomintang bandit gang. He could write to Hu Feng, reporting Chiang Kai-shek's "optimistic" instructions, and wanting Hu Feng to be "optimistic" as well. This is a major special agent, can there still be any doubt? And Hu Feng was directing him, so what Hu Feng was is even easier to understand. For many years, many of us have been deceived by them. How cleverly they disguised themselves! Sometimes publishing articles to educate young people; sometimes making self-criticisms; sometimes supporting this, sometimes opposing that; sometimes writing letters requesting work, sometimes submitting reports requesting to go to the front line. They really seemed like a group of enthusiastic revolutionaries, and we naively treated them with sincerity. Hu Feng and Lu Ling both came to the troops for interviews, and the troops treated them as writers, as engineers of human souls, hoping that they could do something for the troops. But who knew that these guys had such an attitude towards the troops:

"The main force can be defeated in three months, and cleared up in a year. ... The mechanized troops here are airlifted to Jinan, and the anti-tank troops are airlifted to Guihua. If we don't do it, we don't stop, if it's pus, it must be drained!"

I think every soldier of the People's Liberation Army and their family members and friends will be angry. It turns out that Hu Feng and the Hu Feng elements, as early as 1946, along with Chiang Kai-shek, wanted to treat our army, the people called "the most beloved people," as "pus" to be drained. Are these guys any different from the enemies we eliminated on the battlefield?

In fact, the counter-revolutionary guys like Hu Feng are more hateful and more difficult to detect than the enemies on the battlefield. The enemies on the battlefield, "gun against gun, cannon against cannon," we can see at a glance; but the hidden counter-revolutionaries like Hu Feng, disguising themselves as revolutionaries, mixing into the Party, and sometimes even speaking revolutionary words, can easily confuse people. Like Lu Ling going to Korea for interviews, didn't he say it was to immerse himself in life, to show the patriotism and internationalism of the troops? He even showed a certain degree of fearlessness of hardship when he lived with the troops. How much he pretended! He deceived us! But what did Lu Ling do when he came back from Korea? "'Battle' on the Lowland" was his reward for the warm hospitality of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and he first challenged the discipline of our army. Of course, the army couldn't tolerate him and made a serious criticism of his work. But unexpectedly, among the writers writing about the army, some praised this work!

We should all examine ourselves, what responsibility have we fulfilled for the revolution in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries? What losses has our paralysis caused to the revolution? Especially what have our impure Party spirit, liberalism, individualism, and even naivety been exploited by the counter-revolutionaries?

This is what every patriot should consider.

If hundreds of millions of people can be vigilant, like our opposition to the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique this time, from investigating literary and ideological issues to investigating their political background, and paying attention and taking action in all aspects, even a counter-revolutionary clique similar to or more cunning than the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique will eventually be cleared out.

This is a matter related to the fate of our country's socialist construction, and also related to the happiness of our future generations. Any patriot, no matter which construction front he is on in the motherland, clearing out counter-revolutionaries and ensuring the smooth and successful progress of his construction cause is his glorious responsibility. We must understand that it is not okay to sleep with tigers. Counter-revolutionary guys like Hu Feng are like tigers, "If you don't eat it, it will eat you." Especially when the tiger disguises itself as a fox, we must be even more careful.

All patriots! Comrades, brothers and sisters working on various construction fronts: please pay attention, never forget that bad elements will take the opportunity to attack and sabotage you, and sometimes they are even by your side. Be careful!

For the motherland, for socialism, for our mothers and children, eliminate them! Eradicate them!

    清除反革命分子是每一个爱国者的责任
    陈沂
    胡风反革命集团的第三批材料公布了！看了这批材料，我想那些说是“小题大做”，“不过是文艺思想问题”，“文化部门问题”，“几个文化人之间的争论问题”等等的人更会大吃一惊了。
    胡风反革命集团到底是一批什么东西，事实上已经昭然若揭。正如六月十日“人民日报”社论所指出的：“帝国主义国民党特务分子，反动军官，托洛茨基分子，革命叛徒，自首变节分子，就是这个集团的基本骨干。”
    再没有比这批反革命分子自己嘴里说出的话再可靠的了。阿垅——陈亦门，一个胡宗南“战干四团”出来的分子，重庆山洞陆军大学的教官。单看这几个头衔就可以明白。稍为有点同反革命斗争经验的人甚至稍为关心一点时事的人都知道：胡宗南是个什么家伙，“战干四团”又是个什么组织，而陆军大学又何人才可以进去，就明白了阿垅在国民党匪帮中并不是一个等闲之辈。他能给胡风写信，报告蒋介石“乐观”的训话，而且要胡风也跟着“乐观”一番。这是一个大特务分子，还能容许有半点怀疑吗？而胡风，是指挥他的，胡风是什么，当然就更容易明白了。多年来，我们中好些人都被他们欺骗了，他们伪装得多巧妙呀！时而发表文章，教育青年；时而又在检讨；时而又在拥护这个，时而又在反对那个；时而上书要求工作，时而又打报告要求到前线去。他们真像一批热心的革命人士一样，我们也很天真地以赤忱之心待之。胡风、路翎都曾到过部队来采访，部队都是以接待作家，接待人类的灵魂工程师一样接待他们，希望他们能为部队尽一点责任。然而谁知道这帮家伙对部队竟是这样一种态度：
    “三个月可以击破主力，一年肃清。……这里的机械部队空运济南，反战车部队空运归绥。一不做，二不休，是脓，总要排出！”
    我想，我们每个人民解放军的战士和他的家属亲友都会愤怒，原来胡风和胡风分子对我们军队，被人民称为“最可爱的人”的人，早从一九四六年就跟蒋介石一道要把我们当“脓”排除。这伙人难道同我们人民解放军在战场上消灭的敌人有什么两样吗？
    其实，胡风这批反革命的家伙比战场上的敌人更可恶，更难发现。战场上的敌人，“枪对枪、炮对炮”，我们是一眼就可以看见；而胡风这帮暗藏的反革命分子，伪装革命，混进党来，有时还讲点革命的话，就很容易把人模糊了。像路翎到朝鲜去采访，不是说为了深入生活，为了表现部队的爱国主义，国际主义吗？他去部队生活时还表现了一定的不怕艰苦。装得多像呀！就蒙蔽了我们哩！然而路翎从朝鲜回来干的是什么？“洼地上的‘战役’”就是他对中国人民志愿军热情款待他的报答，他首先就向我们军队的纪律挑战。军队当然容他不了，对他这个作品进行了严肃的批评。然而想不到在写军队的作家中，竟有人称赞这篇作品！
    我们都应该检查一番，在同反革命分子作斗争的时候，我们为革命尽了什么责任？我们的麻痹又给革命造成了什么损失？特别是我们的党性不纯，自由主义，个人主义甚至幼稚，又给反革命利用了些什么？
    这是每个爱国者都应该考虑一下的。
    千百万人都能警惕起来，像我们这次反对胡风反革命集团一样，由清查文艺思想到清查他们的政治来历，而且各方面都注意、都动手，即使类似胡风反革命集团或比胡风反革命集团更狡诈的，终究也会被清查出来的。
    这是关系着我们国家社会主义建设的命运问题，也是关系我们子孙万代的幸福问题。任何一个爱国者，不论他在祖国那一个建设战线上，清除反革命分子，保证他的建设事业顺利和成功，都是他的光荣的责任。必须懂得同老虎在一起睡觉是不行的，胡风这班反革命家伙就跟老虎一样，“你不吃它，它就要吃你”。特别当老虎把它打扮成狐狸的时候就更要小心。
      一切爱国者们！在各个建设战线上工作的同志们，兄弟姊妹们：请你们注意，时刻不要忘记，坏分子一有机会就会对你们加以进攻和破坏的，有时他们甚至就在你们的身边。要当心呀！
    为了祖国，为了社会主义，为了我们的母亲和孩子，清除他们！根除他们！
