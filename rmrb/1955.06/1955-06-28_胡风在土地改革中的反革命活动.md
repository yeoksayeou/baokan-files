    Hu Feng's Counter-Revolutionary Activities in the Land Reform
    Lin Xiangbei
    In 1951, Hu Feng came to the Southwest region with the Beijing Land Reform Work Group to participate in the land reform. During the land reform, he carried out a series of counter-revolutionary activities. I participated in the land reform with Hu Feng and worked in one point and one village. I know more about his situation. Now I will expose his main activities as follows:
    As revealed in the "People's Daily" "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group," Hu Feng viciously ridiculed the comrades who accompanied him in the land reform: "When I went, I played very well with some colleagues in the 'primitive' state. If I come back with them after they are 'transformed,' I will play even better." From this, we can see the extreme hatred and hostility of the big special agent Hu Feng towards the great land reform movement and the ideological remolding of intellectuals. The fact is also true. The counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng participated in the land reform, he naturally did not come to help the peasants to turn over, nor did he come to transform himself, but to sabotage the land reform movement, to put on a "revolutionary" mask for his counter-revolutionary face, and to collect materials as capital for his reactionary propaganda in the future. Hu Feng came with such a purpose.
    During the land reform, the Party called on us to closely integrate with the two major movements of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, in order to further enlighten the peasants' class consciousness and sense of ownership. However, Hu Feng despised and opposed this correct instruction of the Party, saying:
  "I am here to engage in land reform, not to resist US aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries." When the higher authorities called on the masses to sign patriotic covenants, he openly opposed, saying that this was "formalism." He slandered the patriotic actions of the peasants who consciously and voluntarily used increased production and savings to donate airplanes and cannons to support the volunteer army as "forced," and spread erroneous remarks, saying that this approach was "superfluous" and "dispersed the land reform forces," saying that the peasants' complaint movement was also "unnecessary" and "formalistic," and that cultivating complaint models was "paternalistic." He opposed the Party's leadership and propaganda education for the peasants, and slandered the necessary enlightenment work for the peasants as "crude," "paternalistic," and "forced," etc., to sabotage the great land reform movement. Because some of us did not seriously adhere to the Party's policy, we once relaxed the combination of the three major movements at that time because of his opposition, which caused the work to take some detours; and because we did not enlighten the peasants' class consciousness well through complaint education, a tendency of "peaceful land reform" was produced in individual places.
    In order to help the staff understand current affairs, each village subscribed to the "Xinhua Daily." Hu Feng never read the newspaper in the village. In order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Party's birthday, around "July 1st," the newspaper published Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." These documents had very important guiding significance for the land reform work, and many comrades rushed to read and study them as if they had found a treasure; but the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng was very indifferent to them, and slandered these great classic works, saying: "Isn't it just the same old stuff!"
    In order to sabotage the land reform, Hu Feng adopted a rude and insulting attitude towards village staff and activists. The vice chairman of the peasant association in his village was a poor peasant who had worked as a hired laborer for a long time and carried sedan chairs for many years; after liberation, he had always worked actively. In order to be busy with land reform, his land was barren, his family had nothing to eat, and he often worked on an empty stomach without complaining. He had high prestige among the masses. Once, during a village meeting, the vice chairman was counting the number of people below and was not discovered by Hu Feng. In the evening, Hu Feng took the opportunity to scold the vice chairman at the village staff meeting, saying that he did not attend the meeting. When the vice chairman explained, Hu Feng scolded him: "Still quibbling! Are you worthy of being a cadre? Are you even human?" The vice chairman cried sadly for several days, saying: "I work on an empty stomach, and you say I am not human!" He even wanted to resign. Hu Feng thought that the youth league members and village staff at that time were not good. He insisted that these people had no prestige among the masses, and ridiculed them as "brave elements," "adventurous elements" (both meaning that he slandered them as people who did not use their brains and rushed around recklessly) or "opportunists." This caused ideological confusion among the cadres, and everyone generally did not want to do it. In fact, most of these staff members and youth league members, except for a very few, were activists who emerged from the suppression of bandits and the elimination of local bullies and the reduction of rent and the return of deposits. Hu Feng used such a vicious method to attack peasant activists and Party and League staff, and to sabotage the land reform movement. Thanks to the county and district committees grasping tightly, Hu Feng's conspiracy did not succeed.
    Hu Feng also regarded the village he led as an independent kingdom, refusing to carry out work in accordance with the unified steps stipulated by the leadership (such as land survey and production determination, the combination of the three major movements, patriotic covenants, etc.). He not only did not attend the periodic reporting meetings of the point himself, but also incited the staff of other villages not to attend. He said: "The road is far and time-consuming, it's not worth it," so that the situation of this point could not be grasped, the resolutions could not be implemented, and the progress of the work was affected.
    During the land reform, Hu Feng used the blind worship of him by some young students to carry out conscious wooing and instigation. For example, there was a female comrade in the point with a vague position, because she often poured tea and water for him and called him "Uncle Hu," he thought he had gained another believer. Once, Hu Feng wrote a poem in her commemorative album, the general idea being: You are a kind maternal figure, you have a pure heart; believe in yourself, don't blindly follow and believe! For example, there was a female comrade in his village who had just come out of school to participate in the land reform, and she was impatient and had a stiff style. She once slammed the table and scolded the peasants and village staff, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses; but Hu Feng deliberately shielded her, saying that she was a good staff member who was hard to find. It was precisely because of his conspiratorial activities that the staff of this point were not united, and many man-made obstacles were encountered in the progress of the work, so that the work of this point was not done well.
    Hu Feng believed that the peasants were absolutely selfish and stupid. During the land survey and production determination, he viciously tried to fool the peasants and sabotage the Party's prestige. For example, he designated several peasants (mostly middle peasants) who were considered experienced to first "estimate" a yield at the edge of the field, and then asked the peasants who cultivated that field to guess (the yield was written on a bamboo sign in advance, not shown to the peasants). If they guessed low, they were said to be selfish and conservative; if they guessed high, the production was determined according to the high yield, which violated the Party's policy. This not only delayed the time, but also caused dissatisfaction among the peasants with the Party and disunity within the peasants.
    After Hu Feng went to the village, he neither went deep into the neighborhoods (small groups in the village) and households, nor did he meet with the masses at various gatherings. He dragged his shoes, waved his fan, and lived in the village peasant association. Because he could not buy good cigarettes and good tea in the market, he often sent someone to Chongqing (sixty or seventy miles round trip) to buy him Huafu brand cigarettes and Longjing tea; Hu Feng also boarded with a capitalist. At that time, many peasants suspected: "Is this the person sent by Chairman Mao?" The peasants called him "Comrade Hu" to his face, but behind his back they called him "Master from Beijing."
    Hu Feng used every opportunity to carry out his counter-revolutionary activities and sabotage the land reform movement. At that time, because his counter-revolutionary conspiracy had not been exposed, we always thought he had ideological problems, so we adopted an accommodating attitude towards him. Now, from the materials exposed about his special agent activities, it is very obvious that this is a part of his counter-revolutionary activities against the Party and against the people.

    胡风在土地改革中的反革命活动
    林向北
    一九五一年，胡风随北京土地改革工作团来西南区参加土地改革。在土地改革中，他进行了一系列的反革命活动。我同胡风一起参加土地改革，并在一个点一个村工作过，对他的情况了解得较多，现在将他的主要活动揭露如下：
    正如“人民日报”“关于胡风反革命集团的第二批材料”中所揭露的，胡风曾恶毒地讥笑和他同行参加土地改革的同志：“去的时候，和‘原始的’状态的一些同行者们玩得很好。如果和‘改造’了以后的他们一道回来，当会玩得更好的。”从这里，就可以看出大特务头子胡风对于伟大的土地改革运动、对于知识分子思想改造的极端仇视和敌意。事实也正是如此，反革命分子胡风参加土地改革，他自然不是来帮助农民翻身，也不是来改造自己，而是来破坏土地改革运动，来为自己的反革命面目挂上“革命”的面具，并收集材料，作为他日后反动宣传的资本。胡风就是怀着这样的目的而来的。
    在进行土地改革时，党号召我们要同当时的抗美援朝、镇压反革命分子两大运动紧密地结合起来，以便进一步启发农民的阶级觉悟和主人翁思想。而胡风却蔑视和反对党的这一正确的指示说：
  “我是来搞土地改革的，不是来抗美援朝、镇压反革命的。”当上级号召群众订爱国公约时，他又公开反对，说这是“形式主义”。他把农民自觉自愿用增产节约来捐献飞机大炮支援志愿军的爱国主义行动，诬蔑地说成是“被迫的”，并散布错误言论，说这种做法是“多余的”，“分散了土地改革力量”，说农民的诉苦运动也是“不必要”的，“形式主义”的，把培养诉苦典型说成是“包办代替”。他反对党对农民的领导和宣传教育，而把对农民的必要的启发工作，诬蔑为“粗暴”、“包办”和“强迫”等等，来破坏伟大的土地改革运动。由于我们一部分人没有认真地坚持党的政策，曾有一段时间因为他的反对而放松了当时三大运动的结合，使工作走了一些弯路；又因为没有很好地通过诉苦教育来启发农民的阶级觉悟，在个别地方曾产生了“和平土改”的倾向。
    为了帮助工作人员了解时事，当时各村都订有“新华日报”。胡风在村里从未看过报。为了纪念党的三十周年生日，在“七一”前后，报纸上发表了毛主席的“中国社会各阶级的分析”和“湖南农民运动考察报告”。这些文件对土地改革工作有着非常重要的指导意义，很多同志如获至宝地争先恐后地阅读研究；可是反革命的胡风却对之非常冷淡，并诬蔑这些伟大的经典著作说：“还不是那一套！”
    为了破坏土地改革，胡风对村工作人员和积极分子采取了粗暴侮蔑的态度。他所在村的农会副主任是个贫农，过去做过很长时间的雇工，并抬过多年的滑杆；解放后一贯积极工作，为了忙于土地改革，他的地荒着，家里没有吃的，经常饿着肚皮来工作，从不埋怨，在群众中威信很高。有一次开村民大会时，这位副主任在下面清点人数，未被胡风发现，到晚上胡风就借机在村工作人员会上大骂副主任，说他不参加会议。当副主任解释时，胡风竟破口大骂：“还要狡辩！你这样还配作干部？你还算人吗？”副主任因此竟伤心地痛哭了几场，他说：“我饿着肚皮来工作，还说我不算人！”竟想辞职不干。胡风认为当时的青年团员和村工作人员都不好。他硬说这些人在群众中没有威信，并讥讽为“勇敢分子”、“冒险分子”（其意均诬蔑他们为不用脑筋、横冲乱闯的人）或“投机分子”。闹得干部思想混乱，普遍不想干。事实上，这些工作人员和青年团员中除了极个别的以外，大多数是清匪反霸、减租退押中涌现出来的积极分子。胡风竟用这样狠毒的办法打击农民积极分子和党、团工作人员，破坏土地改革运动。由于县委会、区委会抓得紧，胡风的阴谋才未得逞。
    胡风还把自己领导的那个村当成独立王国，拒绝按照领导上所规定的统一步骤去进行工作（如查田定产、三大运动的结合、爱国公约等）。他不但自己不去参加点的定期汇报会议，同时还煽动其他村的工作人员也不去参加。他说：“路远费时间，得不偿失”，以致这个点的情况掌握不起来，决议贯彻不下去，影响工作的进展。
    在土地改革中，胡风利用某些青年学生对他的盲目崇拜，进行了有意识的笼络和挑拨。如点里有一个立场模糊的女同志，因为经常给他倒茶打水，叫他“胡老伯”，他就认为又收了一个信徒，有一次胡风在她的纪念册上写了一首诗，大意是：你是一个善良的母性，你有一颗纯朴的心；相信自己吧，不要盲从轻信！又如他所在村有一个刚由学校出来参加土地改革的女同志，性情急躁，作风生硬，曾拍桌大骂农民和村工作人员，引起群众不满；但胡风却别有用意地来袒护她，说她是一个很难找的好工作人员。正由于他的这种阴谋活动，使这个点的工作人员闹不团结，在工作的进行上遭到许多人为的阻难，以致这个点的工作搞得不好。
    胡风认为农民是绝对地自私和愚蠢的。在查田定产时，他恶毒地设法愚弄农民，并破坏党的威信。例如，他指定几个被认为有经验的农民（多半是中农），先到田边“估计”一个产量，然后再叫耕种那块田的农民去猜（事先将产量写在竹牌上，不给农民看）。猜低了，说是自私、保守；猜高了，就按照高的定产，违反了党的政策，这不但拖延了时间，而且引起农民对党的不满和农民内部的不团结。
    胡风下村后，既不深入到邻（村中的小组）和户，也不在各种集会上同群众见面，他整天拖着鞋，摇着扇子，住在村农会里，由于场上买不到好烟和好茶，所以经常有一人到重庆（往返六七十里路）去给他买华福牌香烟和龙井茶叶；胡风并在一个资本家家里搭伙食。当时很多农民怀疑：“这是毛主席派来的人吗？”农民当面称他“胡同志”，背后却叫他“北京来的老爷”。
    胡风就是这样利用一切机会来进行他的反革命活动，破坏土地改革运动的。当时，由于他的反革命阴谋尚未被揭穿，我们还总以为他是思想问题，因而对他采取迁就的态度。现在，从所揭露的他的特务活动的材料看，十分明显，这正是他反对党、反对人民的反革命活动的一个部分。
