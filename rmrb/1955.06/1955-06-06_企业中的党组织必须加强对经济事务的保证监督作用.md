    Party Organizations in Enterprises Must Strengthen Their Guarantee and Supervisory Role Over Economic Affairs
    Huang Zhong
    We oppose party organizations in enterprises directly handling economic affairs, because this is a substitution for administrative work. This will not only greatly weaken the initiative and enthusiasm of enterprise administrative management personnel, but also prevent party organizations from fulfilling their supervisory and guaranteeing role in enterprises. Currently, the phenomenon of party organizations in some enterprises taking over economic affairs has decreased, which is, of course, very good. However, some enterprise party organizations, in overcorrecting, have produced another kind of deviation, which is that they do not ask about or understand economic affairs at all, but merely engage in isolated political and ideological work, believing that this is neither taking over nor can it fulfill its guarantee and supervisory tasks. Undoubtedly, this understanding of the role of party organizations in enterprises is completely wrong.
    Enterprises are economic institutions that create material wealth for the state, and their basic activity is economic activity. The party's guaranteeing role and supervisory role in enterprises are based on this economic activity. If economic activity in enterprises loses the party's guarantee and supervision, there will inevitably be varying degrees of phenomena that violate the interests of the party and the state. This cannot be allowed. If the political and ideological work of party organizations in enterprises is divorced from economic activity, it will not only lack concrete and vivid content, but this political and ideological work itself will become less meaningful. This should also be prevented. Therefore, party organizations in enterprises should, on the one hand, not directly handle economic affairs and directly command the work of workshops and departments, and should give full play to the functions of enterprise management personnel in leading production activities; on the other hand, they must be familiar with economic activities in enterprises and the work of various workshops and departments, strengthen political and ideological leadership, and guarantee and supervise that economic activities in enterprises are carried out completely in accordance with the party's guidelines and policies. This is the correct path for the activities of party organizations in enterprises.
    To strengthen the political and ideological work of the party in enterprises, we must first strengthen the party organizations' concern and understanding of economic affairs, and discover and solve problems at any time. Some comrades believe that it is difficult to carry out political and ideological work in combination with economic activities in enterprises, as if there is not much content for political and ideological work to be found in economic activities. The actual situation is not like this at all. The question is whether the party organization has researched and analyzed these economic activities to discover problems and help the administration solve them. If this is done, it will be felt that the content of political and ideological work in enterprises is very rich. Taking the formulation of plans as an example, this is an important part of the implementation of planned management in enterprises. If the plan is formulated in a way that is consistent with reality, it will exert a full mobilizing force. If the plan is not formulated in a way that is consistent with reality, it will also encourage undesirable tendencies in enterprise production. However, many enterprise party organizations rarely ask about the work of formulating plans, thinking that this is only an administrative matter, and the party organization only waits until the plan is formulated before mobilizing the masses to guarantee its realization. The Party Committee of Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is like this. This year, the state stipulates that the factory cost of each lathe is 8,003 yuan. The administration tried three times to figure out the bottom line, but it always failed to meet the target. The administrative management personnel believed that the potential had been exhausted. The Party Committee did not fight against this conservative thinking, but waited for the administration to formulate the plan and then mobilized the masses to discuss it. From this example, it can be seen that the party organization must work and supervise the process of formulating the enterprise plan, and cannot completely push this important economic activity to the administration. The role played by the party organization in formulating this year's plan for the Zibo Mining Bureau is a good proof. The Zibo Mining Bureau started the preparation of the 1955 plan in September last year. The Bureau's Party Committee attached importance to the leadership of this work and found that many cadres had wrong understandings of the preparation of the plan. The party work cadres believed that the preparation of the plan was a matter for the department personnel, and they could ignore it; the administrative responsible cadres always wanted to leave some leeway, fearing that if the plan was formulated too high, the higher authorities would add additional tasks; the department staff members were worried about being criticized for failing to complete the plan in the future, so they would rather be conservative; and some cadres believed that making a "safe" plan now, and then exceeding the target every month in the future, would be easier and more glorious. In response to these ideological situations, the Party Committee carried out a series of political and ideological work, mobilizing party work cadres and administrative management personnel to jointly explore advanced technical norms, study technical organization measures, present the situation, calculate detailed accounts, and break various conservative ideas with vivid facts. This not only made the formulated plan more realistic, but also provided a profound education for party work cadres and administrative management cadres.
    Furthermore, taking the economic activity analysis meeting in enterprises as an example, this is an important method for relying on the masses to do a good job in cost and financial work, and it is also a good opportunity for party organizations to familiarize themselves with business and carry out political and ideological work. However, some enterprise party organizations also regard this only as an administrative matter, neither participating nor asking about it. In fact, if the party organization strengthens the supervision of this kind of meeting, it will discover and solve many specific ideological problems that are not conducive to the party and the state. Let's look at an example from the Shandong Chemical Plant. At an economic activity analysis meeting held by this factory not long ago, the following question was raised: In order to save wood last year, the boxes for packaging products were changed from 22.5 kilograms per box to 30 kilograms, and later, the relevant leading agency instructed to change it to 24 kilograms. In this way, the annual cost of wooden boxes would increase by 280,000 yuan. The administrative responsible comrades believed that this would increase the cost of the enterprise, which was very uneconomical. At that time, the comrades of the Party Committee analyzed this issue and believed that considering the convenience of the users, considering the physical labor of the workers and production safety, materials should not be saved solely for the purpose of reducing costs. In this way, the Party Committee's analysis that took the overall situation into consideration promptly overcame the departmentalism that only proceeded from the interests of the enterprise.
    Secondly, if the party organization wants to care about economic affairs work, it must conscientiously study the production tasks assigned to the enterprise by the leading organs and the instructions on improving enterprise management work. The problem is obvious: If the party organization does not know what the production tasks of the enterprise are? What is the key to improving management? Guarantee and supervision are out of the question. And a more common problem now is that the cadres of the party organization do not seriously or have no interest in studying the instructions of the higher-level administrative organs. At a Party Committee meeting of a factory, the factory director, who was also a member of the Party Committee, conveyed the instructions from the higher authorities on technical management work. The Party Committee Secretary first expressed impatience, repeatedly urging the factory director to convey it quickly, and said: "Anyway, there are documents, just read them later." The factory director did not explain this instruction in detail, but just read the instruction in a hurry, and the Party Committee did not conduct a serious discussion. When the meeting was dismissed, the Party Committee Secretary routinely said, "Everyone should study hard," but in fact the Party Committee cadres, including the Party Committee Secretary, did not study. As a result, on technical issues, the opinions of the Party Committee and the administration could not be well unified under the spirit of the higher-level instructions. The Party Committee emphasized that the technical standards were not realistic, and the administration emphasized that the workers did not abide by the operating procedures. This could not but affect the smooth progress of enterprise production.
    Finally, strengthening political and ideological work among department personnel is also necessary for strengthening the supervision of economic affairs by enterprise party organizations, and it is also one of the ways to help enterprise party organizations become familiar with economic affairs. In general, the political and ideological work of general enterprise party organizations is weak, and the political and ideological work among department personnel is particularly weak. Some party organizations have a one-sided view, believing that political and ideological work among workers is important, while political and ideological work among department personnel is not important, which is of course wrong. The management organization of the factory is composed of various departments. The level of political and ideological awareness and business level of the department personnel is directly related to the quality of enterprise management. Weakening the party's political and ideological work among department personnel is to weaken the party's leadership over economic affairs. The one-sided view of underestimating political and ideological work among department personnel must be overcome. In addition, the fact that the party organization does not effectively strengthen political and ideological work among department personnel is also related to the party organization's unfamiliarity with economic affairs. For example, some party organizations believe that it is easy to do political and ideological work among workers, but it is difficult to do political and ideological work among department personnel. Some party work cadres, because they do not understand technology or business, are even unwilling to approach department personnel. In this way, while relaxing political and ideological work among department personnel, they also give up the opportunity to learn business knowledge from department personnel. Therefore, it is very necessary for party work cadres in enterprises to pay attention to carrying out political and ideological work among department personnel on the one hand, and to humbly learn business knowledge from department personnel on the other hand, and to consider and solve this in connection with strengthening the party's supervision and guarantee role over economic affairs.
    Party organizations are responsible for the overall guarantee and supervision of all activities in enterprises, especially economic activities. It is of course necessary to oppose political and ideological work being carried out in isolation from economic activities. The tendency to guarantee and supervise a part while abandoning another part should also be prevented. Because the entire enterprise is a unified whole, the work of each part is not only closely related and mutually influential, but also, no matter which part of the work has shortcomings, it will affect the completion of the production tasks. Party organizations in enterprises should care about all activities in their enterprises, understand and be familiar with all activities in their enterprises, and influence all activities in their enterprises through their political and ideological work, so that all activities in the enterprise feel the role of the party organization. Only in this way can the party organization's guarantee and supervision be comprehensive and powerful, and only in this way can the economic activities in the enterprise fully comply with the interests of the party and the state.

    企业中的党组织必须加强对经济事务的保证监督作用
    黄钟
    我们反对企业中的党组织直接处理经济事务，因为这是对行政工作的包办代替。这样，不但会大大削弱企业行政管理人员工作的积极性和主动性，同时，党组织也不能实现对企业的监督和保证作用。目前，一些企业中党组织包办代替经济事务的现象是减少了，这当然很好。可是，有的企业的党组织，矫枉过正，产生了另外一种偏向，就是对经济事务根本不去过问，也不去了解，只是在那里孤立地进行政治思想工作，以为这样就既不是包办代替，又可以完成自己保证和监督的任务了。毫无疑问，这样理解企业中党组织的作用是完全错误的。
    企业是为国家创造物质财富的经济机构，它的基本活动是经济活动，党对企业的保证作用也好，监督作用也好，都是以这种经济活动为基础的。企业中的经济活动要是失掉了党的保证和监督，必然会发生程度不等的违反党和国家利益的现象。这是不能允许的。企业中党组织的政治思想工作要是脱离了经济活动，不光是不可能有具体生动的内容，而且这种政治思想工作本身都变得没有多大意义了。这同样是应该防止的。因此，企业中的党组织一方面不应该直接去处理经济事务，直接去指挥车间和科室的工作，要充分发挥企业管理人员领导生产活动的职能；另一方面又必须熟悉企业中的经济活动，熟悉各个车间和科室的工作，加强政治思想领导，保证和监督企业中的经济活动完全按照党的方针政策去进行。这才是企业党组织活动的正确途径。
    要加强企业中党的政治思想工作，首先就要加强党组织对经济事务的关心和了解，随时发现问题，解决问题。有的同志认为结合企业中的经济活动进行政治思想工作很困难，好像在经济活动中找不到多少进行政治思想工作的内容。实际情况决不是如此。问题在于党组织是不是对这些经济活动进行了研究分析，去发现问题，并且帮助行政上去解决问题。如果这样作了，一定会感到企业中的政治思想工作内容是很丰富的。拿编制计划来说，这是企业实行计划管理的重要环节。计划编制得切合实际，就会发挥充分的动员力量，要是编制得不切合实际，还会助长企业生产中的不良倾向。可是不少企业党组织对编制计划的工作很少过问，认为这仅仅是行政上的事，党组织只等计划编好之后，发动群众去保证实现。济南第一机床厂党委会就是这样。今年国家规定每台车床的工厂成本是八千零三元，行政上摸了三次底，始终达不到指标，行政管理人员就认为潜力已经挖光了。党委会也没有同这种保守思想作斗争，而是坐等行政上把计划编好了，自己去发动群众讨论。从这个例子可以看出，党组织必须在企业计划的编制过程中进行工作，进行监督，不能把这一重要的经济活动完全推给行政。淄博矿务局编制今年计划中党组织发挥的作用，就是很好的证明。淄博矿务局去年九月就开始了一九五五年计划的编制工作，局的党委会重视了对这一工作的领导，发现很多干部对编制计划存在着错误的认识，党的工作干部认为编制计划是科室人员的事，自己可以不加过问；行政负责干部总想留点后手，怕编得高了，上级再给追加任务；科室工作人员耽心将来完不成计划受批评，所以宁肯保守些；还有一些干部认为现在编个“保险”计划，以后月月超额，又省劲，又光荣。党委会针对这些思想情况，作了一系列的政治思想工作，动员党的工作干部和行政管理人员一起摸先进技术定额，研究技术组织措施，摆情况，算细账，用活生生的事实打破了各种保守思想。这样不仅使编制出来的计划更切合实际，同时也是对党的工作干部和行政管理干部的一次深刻的教育。
    再拿企业中的经济活动分析会议来说，这是依靠群众作好成本财务工作的重要方法，也是党组织熟悉业务进行政治思想工作的很好机会。可是，有些企业党组织也把这仅仅看作是行政的事，既不参加，也不过问。事实上，党组织要是加强对这种会议的监督，就会发现和解决很多不利于党和国家的具体思想问题。我们且看山东化工厂的一个例子。这个工厂在不久以前举行的一次经济活动分析会议上，提出了这样一个问题：该厂装产品的箱子，去年为了节省木材，由每箱装二十二点五公斤改成三十公斤，后来，有关领导机关又指示改成二十四公斤。这样，每年的木箱费用就要增加开支二十八万元，行政负责同志认为这样就增大了企业成本，很不合算。当时，党委会的同志对这个问题进行了分析，认为考虑到使用单位的方便，考虑到工人的体力劳动和生产安全，不应该单纯为了减低成本去节约材料。这样，党委会照顾全局的分析就及时地克服了只从本企业利益出发的本位主义思想。
    其次，党组织要关心经济事务工作，就必须认真学习领导机关交给本企业的生产任务和关于改进企业管理工作的指示。问题很明显，如果党组织不了解本企业的生产任务是什么？改进管理的关键是什么？保证和监督是无从谈起的。而现在比较普遍存在的一个问题是党组织的干部不大认真也没有兴趣学习上级行政机关的指示。一个工厂的一次党委会上，由党委委员之一的厂长传达上级关于技术管理工作的指示，党委书记首先表现了不耐烦的情绪，一再催促厂长快些传达，并且说：“反正有文件，以后看就是。”厂长也就没有把这一指示加以详细说明，只是匆匆地把指示念了一遍，党委会也没有作认真讨论。散会的时候，党委书记虽然也照例说了一句：“大家要好好学习”，但是实际上党委干部包括党委书记在内并没有学习。结果，在有关技术的问题上，党委和行政的意见就不能在上级指示的精神下很好的统一起来，党委强调技术标准不切合实际，行政就强调工人不遵守操作规程。这当然不能不影响企业生产的顺利进行。
    最后，加强科室人员中的政治思想工作，也是加强企业党组织对经济事务监督所必需的，同时，也是帮助企业党组织熟悉经济事务的办法之一。总的来说，一般企业党组织的政治思想工作是薄弱的，而科室人员中的政治思想工作尤其薄弱。有些党组织有一种片面的看法，认为工人中的政治思想工作重要，科室人员中的政治思想工作不重要，这当然是不对的。工厂的管理机构是由各个科室组成的，科室人员的政治思想水平和业务水平的高低，对企业管理工作的好坏有直接关系，削弱党在科室人员中的政治思想工作，就是削弱党对经济事务的领导。轻视在科室人员中进行政治思想工作的片面观点是必须克服的。另外，党组织不去切实加强科室人员中的政治思想工作，也和党组织不熟悉经济事务有关。比如有的党组织就认为工人中的政治思想工作好做，科室人员中的政治思想工作难做，有些党的工作干部，由于自己不懂技术，不通业务，甚至不愿意和科室人员接近，这样在放松对科室人员的政治思想工作同时，也就放弃了向科室人员学习业务知识的机会。因此，企业中党的工作干部一方面要注意在科室人员中进行政治思想工作，同时，也要虚心向科室人员学习业务知识，把这一点和加强党对经济事务的监督保证作用联系起来加以考虑和解决，是非常必要的。
    党组织对企业中的一切活动，特别是经济活动，负有全面保证和监督的责任。党的政治思想工作离开经济活动孤立地进行固然必须反对，就是保证和监督一部分而放弃别一部分的倾向也要防止。因为整个企业是一个统一的整体，各部分的工作不但密切关联互相影响，而且不论那一部分的工作有缺点，都会影响生产任务的完成。企业中的党组织应该关心本企业的一切活动，了解和熟悉本企业的一切活动，通过自己的政治思想工作去影响本企业的一切活动，使得企业中的全部活动都感到党组织的作用，只有这样，党组织的保证和监督才是全面的和有力的，也只有这样，企业中的经济活动才能完全符合党和国家的利益。
