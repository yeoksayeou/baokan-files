They are Respected and Loved by the Masses
    Gao Yisheng

    From 1950 to 1954, eight demobilized soldiers returned to Gaoxigou Village, Angou Township, Fifth District, Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province. Among them, six were Communist Party members and one was a Communist Youth League member. They had all undergone training in the long revolutionary war and received education from the People's Army, generally possessing a higher level of political consciousness. After returning to their hometown, they all participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, becoming the backbone of rural work. For example, when demobilized soldier Gao Zhaosheng returned to his hometown in 1950, there were no mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the village. He took the lead in organizing a temporary mutual aid group. Through active efforts, he overcame various difficulties in the mutual aid group. In 1953, the group's total land yield increased by 34% compared to 1952. This further strengthened everyone's determination to take the road of collectivization, so the temporary mutual aid group was transformed into a permanent mutual aid group. In January 1954, after returning from working on the Third Delegation to Korea to Comfort the Troops, he publicized the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the villagers, calling on everyone to support our "most beloved people" with active actions of organizing and advancing towards socialism. He first persuaded his mutual aid group and two nearby permanent mutual aid groups to transform into agricultural production cooperatives. Demobilized soldiers such as Gao Wanfu also subsequently organized two cooperatives. Now, out of the 59 households in the village, 52 have already joined agricultural production cooperatives.

    Demobilized soldiers actively leading the masses in production have been respected and loved by the villagers. The leaders of the three agricultural production cooperatives in Gaoxigou Village, three township people's representatives, and the main staff in the village are all demobilized soldiers. One of them was even selected as a provincial model demobilized soldier. The villagers praised them, saying: "Demobilized soldiers are good soldiers of Chairman Mao, combat heroes on the front lines, and production models in the rear."

    Demobilized soldiers actively engage in production, their incomes have increased, and their lives have improved. Two demobilized soldiers who were previously unmarried have also found satisfactory partners and established happy families.

    The Party branch of Gaoxigou Village, in order to do a good job in resettling demobilized soldiers, has actively carried out publicity and education, continuously improving the understanding of cadres and the masses regarding the work of resettling demobilized soldiers, so that they understand that doing a good job in resettling demobilized soldiers is of great importance to strengthening national defense construction and promoting the socialist transformation, and is a glorious political task of the people's government and the broad masses of the people. Therefore, cadres and the masses can actively and warmly receive demobilized soldiers, and help them solve difficulties in production and life after returning to their hometowns. For example, when demobilized soldier Gao Wanfu returned to his hometown in 1950, the village cadres and the masses warmly welcomed him, and mobilized eleven livestock to transport the five shi of production assistance grain given to him by the government from the county. During the "Spring Festival" and the "August 1st" Army Day, cadres and the masses cordially expressed their regards to the demobilized soldiers, encouraging them to continue to play an active role in agricultural production and work. All this has made the demobilized soldiers deeply feel the care of the Party and the government for them, and the respect and love of the people for them, and their political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm have also been continuously improved.

    It is inevitable that demobilized soldiers will encounter some difficulties in production after returning to their hometowns due to being away for many years. Moreover, some families have very little foundation and lack means of production, and there are varying degrees of difficulty in production and life. In addition to educating demobilized soldiers to actively overcome difficulties in production, Gaoxigou Village has successively helped four demobilized soldiers who had difficulties in production and life purchase three heads of cattle and ten sheep, and build one kiln. For a demobilized soldier without land, after discussion by the masses, ten mu of wasteland jointly reclaimed by the village was given to him for cultivation. This has basically solved the difficulties of demobilized soldiers participating in production and stimulated their enthusiasm for production.

    Demobilized soldiers returning to the countryside is only the beginning of their transition to production and construction. More importantly, their ideological education and production leadership must be strengthened regularly in order to consolidate the resettlement results. Gaoxigou Village often holds forums for demobilized soldiers in conjunction with the central task, checking the resettlement work on the one hand and educating the demobilized soldiers on the other. At the forums, criticism and self-criticism are carried out, model figures among the demobilized soldiers are commended, and those who are not good are also given appropriate criticism. This consolidates the good and educates the bad. For example, demobilized soldier Gao Zengcun was once not at ease with agricultural production in 1952, resulting in rough cultivation and reduced yields. After meeting education, he settled down and actively participated in agricultural production. Due to intensive cultivation, his land yield in 1954 was more than three times higher than in 1952.

    Gaoxigou Village pays attention to cultivating and relying on demobilized soldiers to carry out work in every central task. Usually, they are given certain work tasks and the methods to complete the tasks are explained. When there is an opportunity, they are also selected to participate in certain meetings or training courses for learning. This not only helps the work of the whole village, but also continuously improves the political level and working ability of the demobilized soldiers. In 1954, demobilized soldier Gao Wanfu was selected to participate in the training class for mutual aid and cooperation backbone members in the Suide Special Zone. After learning, he improved his ideological understanding and strengthened his determination to take the road of collectivization. After returning, he patiently persuaded seven households to form an agricultural production cooperative, and he was elected as the director of the cooperative.

    他们受到群众的尊敬和爱戴
    高一生
    陕西省米脂县第五区安沟乡高西沟村从一九五○年到一九五四年回来了八名复员军人，其中共产党员六人，青年团员一人。他们都经过较长期革命战争的锻炼，受过人民军队的教育，一般政治觉悟较高。他们回乡以后，都参加了互助合作组织，成为农村工作中的骨干力量。如复员军人高照盛一九五○年回乡时，村中还没有互助合作组织，他首先带头组织了一个临时互助组，经过积极努力，克服了互助组中的各种困难，在一九五三年，全组土地产量比一九五二年增加了百分之三十四。这就更加坚定了大家走合作化道路的决心，于是又把临时互助组转变成为常年互助组。一九五四年一月，他参加第三届赴朝慰问团工作回来，向全村群众宣传了志愿军的英勇事迹，号召大家用组织起来向社会主义前进的积极行动来支援我们“最可爱的人”。他首先说服了他所领导的互助组和附近两个常年互助组转为农业生产合作社。复员军人高万富等也随后组织起两个社。现在全村五十九户人家，已经有五十二户参加了农业生产合作社。
    复员军人积极领导群众生产，受到了全村群众的尊敬和爱戴。高西沟村三个农业生产合作社的领导人，三个乡人民代表和村里主要工作人员，都选由复员军人担任。还有一个被评选为省的模范复员军人。村里群众称赞他们说：“复员军人是毛主席的好战士，在前方是战斗英雄，在后方是生产模范。”
    复员军人积极生产，收入增加了，生活也改善了。原来没有结婚的两个复员军人也找到了满意的对象，建立了幸福美满的家庭。
    高西沟村党的支部为了作好安置复员军人的工作，曾经积极进行宣传教育，不断地提高干部和群众对安置复员军人工作的认识，使他们了解做好复员军人的安置工作，对加强国防建设和促进社会主义改造事业有很大关系，是人民政府和广大人民群众的一项光荣的政治任务。因此，干部和群众都能积极热情地接待复员军人，帮助他们解决回乡后生产和生活上的困难。如复员军人高万富一九五○年复员回乡时，村干部和群众都热情地欢迎他，并且动员了十一头牲口，把政府给他的五石生产资助粮由县运回。每当“春节”、“八一”建军节时，干部和群众都亲切地慰问复员军人，勉励他们在农业生产和工作岗位上继续发挥积极作用。这一切都使复员军人深深感到党和政府对他们的关怀，人民群众对他们的尊敬和爱戴，政治积极性和生产积极性也不断得到提高。
    复员军人由于离乡年久，回乡生产开始有些困难是不可避免的。而且有些人家底很薄，缺乏生产资料，在生产和生活上存在着程度不同的困难。高西沟村除教育复员军人积极克服生产中的困难外，先后帮助四个生产上和生活上有困难的复员军人购买耕畜三头，羊十只，修窑一孔。对一个没有土地的复员军人，经过群众讨论，把村上共同开垦的十亩荒地让给他耕种。这样就基本上解决了复员军人参加生产的困难，激发了他们的生产积极性。
    复员军人回到农村，只是他们转向生产建设的开始，更重要的是要对他们加强经常的思想教育和生产领导，以巩固安置成果。高西沟村经常结合中心工作召开复员军人座谈会，一面检查安置工作，一面对复员军人进行教育。在座谈会上，开展批评和自我批评，对复员军人中的模范人物进行表扬，不好的也予以适当批评。这样既巩固了好的，也教育了不好的。如复员军人高增存，一九五二年一度不安心农业生产，以致耕作粗糙，产量减少。经过会议教育，他安心了，积极参加农业生产。由于精耕细作，一九五四年他的土地产量比一九五二年提高了三倍多。
    高西沟村在每项中心工作中，都注意培养和依靠复员军人进行工作。平时，交给他们一定的工作任务，并交代完成任务的办法。有机会时，还选送他们参加一定会议或训练班进行学习。这样不仅对全村的工作有帮助，而且也使复员军人的政治水平和工作能力得到不断提高。一九五四年复员军人高万富被选送参加了绥德专区互助合作骨干分子训练班。经过学习，提高了思想认识，坚定了走合作化道路的决心，回来以后，他耐心说服了七户群众组成了一个农业生产合作社，他被选为社主任。
