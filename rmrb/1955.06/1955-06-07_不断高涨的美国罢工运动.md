Xinhua News Agency, New York: The strike movement in the United States is steadily rising.

    According to a United Press report on June 2nd, there were a total of 500 strikes, large and small, in the United States in April, involving more than 300,000 workers and resulting in 2.6 million lost workdays. The number of strikes in April was 50 more than in March, and March was already the third consecutive month of increasing strike frequency this year.
    In May, the strike movement continued to surge. Workers in the railroad, telecommunications, textile, electrical, rubber, and motor transport industries, as well as other sectors, either went on strike or continued striking in May.
    American newspapers, in looking ahead to the prospects for the American workers' strike movement, believe that because the United Automobile Workers Union, with approximately 500,000 members, has overwhelmingly voted in favor of striking if management refuses to meet the workers' demands for wage increases, and because the United Steelworkers of America, with 1.2 million members, will be making demands to improve working conditions when their labor contracts expire at the end of June, American workers' strikes may further expand in the future.
    A recent characteristic of the American strike movement is that many strikes have lasted for a long time. Despite the various methods used by employers and government authorities to obstruct and undermine the strikes, workers have persisted in fighting to protect their own vital interests. For example, the strike of more than 40,000 telephone workers in nine southern states lasted for 68 days, and the strike of 19,000 textile workers in New England lasted for more than a month.
    During the strikes, American workers in different regions and industries showed close solidarity. For example, the strike of hotel workers in Miami received full support from hotel workers in New York. The telephone workers in the nine southern states received considerable material assistance from workers in other industries during their strike.

    不断高涨的美国罢工运动
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：美国罢工运动不断高涨。
    据合众社六月二日报道，在今年四月份，美国一共发生了五百次大大小小的罢工，参加罢工的人数有三十多万，因罢工而损失的工作日达二百六十万个。四月份的罢工数目比三月份多五十次，而三月份就已经是今年罢工次数连续增加的第三个月了。
    在五月份，罢工运动继续高涨。在五月里举行罢工或者继续罢工的有铁路、电讯、纺织工业、电气工业、橡胶工业、汽车运输业以及其他行业的工人。
     美国报刊在瞻望美国工人罢工运动的前景时认为，由于联合汽车工人工会约五十万会员已经以压倒多数赞成在资方一旦拒绝工人提出的关于提高工资的要求时就举行罢工，以及拥有一百二十万会员的联合钢铁工人工会在六月底劳资合同期满时将要提出改善工人工作条件的要求，美国工人的罢工今后还可能进一步扩大。
    美国罢工运动近来的一个特点是，许多次罢工延续时间很长，尽管雇主和政府当局使用种种办法来阻挠和破坏罢工，工人还是坚持为维护自己的切身利益而斗争。例如美国南部九个州的四万多电话工人的罢工就坚持了六十八天，新英格兰的一万九千名纺织工人的罢工也坚持了一个多月。
    在罢工中，不同地区和行业的美国工人间表现了紧密的团结。例如迈阿密旅馆工人的罢工就得到了纽约旅馆工人全力的支援。南部九个州的电话工人在罢工期间先后收到了其他行业的工人在物质上的许多帮助。
