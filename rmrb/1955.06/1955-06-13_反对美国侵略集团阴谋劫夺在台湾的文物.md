    Oppose the US Aggression Group's Conspiracy to Plunder Cultural Relics in Taiwan
    An exhibition opposing the US aggression group's conspiracy to plunder cultural relics in Taiwan opened on June 8th at the Palace Museum in Beijing.

    Through pictures and various materials, the exhibition powerfully illustrates the crimes of American imperialism in looting countless Chinese cultural heritages and artistic treasures over the past century using extremely vile and shameless means. It also points out the fact that American imperialism is currently conspiring with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to loot and transport many cultural relics in Taiwan to the United States.

    After seeing the exhibition, the audience unanimously expressed their anger and determination to track down and retrieve all of China's precious cultural relics.

    This is the San Shi Pan of the Western Zhou Dynasty, which was stolen to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and now the US aggression group is conspiring to plunder it to the United States. The San Shi Pan of the Western Zhou Dynasty is a national treasure passed down through generations concerning the land system of the Zhou Dynasty.

    A Tang Dynasty fresco from Dunhuang, which was looted by the United States and is now in the Fogg Museum in the United States. The Fogg Museum exhibited this fresco at the Chinese Art Exhibition held in London in 1935. The number is 676.

    Kesi (silk tapestry) embroidery from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties are the most precious arts and crafts of ancient China, and very few have been passed down through generations. The kesi embroidery collected by the Palace Museum have all been looted to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is the Song Dynasty's kesi embroidery "Lao Tzu and the Green Ox."

    反对美国侵略集团阴谋劫夺在台湾的文物
    反对美国侵略集团阴谋劫夺在台湾文物展览已于六月八日在北京故宫博物院开幕。
    这个展览通过图片和各种资料，有力地说明了近百年来美国帝国主义用极卑鄙无耻的手段掠夺了我国无数文化遗产和艺术宝藏的罪行，并指出目前美帝国主义正阴谋勾结蒋介石卖国集团要把在我国台湾的许多文物劫运美国的事实。
    观众看了这个展览以后，一致愤怒地表示要把我国全部的珍贵文物追查回来。

    这是被蒋介石卖国集团盗运到台湾，现在美国侵略集团又阴谋掠夺到美国去的西周散氏盘。西周散氏盘是有关周代土地制度的传世国宝。
    被美国劫走现存美国福格博物馆中的敦煌唐代壁画。一九三五年伦敦举行中国艺术展览时，福格博物馆曾把这幅壁画拿去展览。编号是六七六号。
    宋、元、明、清四代的缂丝刺绣是我国古代最珍贵的工艺美术品，传世很少。故宫博物院所藏的缂丝刺绣都已被蒋介石卖国集团掠夺到台湾。这是宋朝的缂丝“老子青牛”。
