Readers Qin Beihai, Zhang Jifu, and others wrote to reflect that in Yangjiaogou, Shandong Province, seven fishermen were poisoned by eating pufferfish, two of whom died. Reader Shen Jian suggested that all regions should take measures to prevent pufferfish poisoning accidents. After discussing this with the Aquatic Products Management Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, this newspaper believes that preventing pufferfish poisoning is an issue that deserves the close attention of the masses in all regions.

Pufferfish (called "Bā yú" in Shandong and Northeast China, "? yú" or "Guǐ zǎi yú" in Fujian, and "Jī bào" in Guangdong) is a food that is produced in large quantities, is inexpensive, and has a delicious flavor. This fish is spindle-shaped, has smooth skin, and no scales. Its gonads (testes and ovaries), liver, stomach, intestines, spinal cord, and blood contain toxins, with the gonads being more toxic during the spring spawning season.

Over the past few years, there have been continuous incidents of poisoning and death due to accidental consumption of pufferfish. Since the beginning of the fishing season this year, there have been eleven cases in Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, Hebei, Wuhan, and Ulanhot, poisoning fifty-eight people, of whom nineteen died. The symptoms of poisoning are generally dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, followed by difficulty breathing and numbness throughout the body. Severe cases can result in death within one or two hours, with the body turning blue after death. The main reasons for these poisoning incidents are: First, some aquatic product departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the potential for pufferfish to cause poisoning and have not carried out the necessary publicity and education work among the masses. Second, production units and transportation and sales departments do not handle the catch properly and are not strict enough in selecting fish. For example, during the spring fishing season this year, pufferfish were mixed in with the yellow croaker being distributed in the Lushun area. This fish was transported to Ulanhot City, where local residents lacked common knowledge and were completely unaware that this type of fish was poisonous, resulting in poisoning and death. Third, some people hold a blind attitude of "eating pufferfish at the risk of death." They clearly know that pufferfish is poisonous, but they greedily eat this fish's delicious flavor, leading to poisoning due to careless cooking and preparation.

Aquatic product departments and relevant departments in all regions should attach importance to publicizing the prevention of pufferfish poisoning, explaining the dangers of eating pufferfish to the masses, and introducing some methods for handling pufferfish for consumption. To eat pufferfish, first remove the head and skin, cut out the internal organs and blood clots, and wash the blood clean. Then, soak the meat in clean water until it is no longer bloody before frying or drying it into dried fish before eating. State-owned aquatic product companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in coastal and riverine areas must carry out detoxification treatment carefully during processing. Aquatic product markets and aquatic product transportation and sales departments in all regions should strictly inspect fish shipments for any fresh pufferfish mixed in. If there are any, they should be placed separately and fish vendors should be controlled to prevent them from being transported and sold to areas without a history of consumption. When selling, buyers should be informed to pay attention to washing and preparation methods to ensure safety.

### 防止吃河豚鱼中毒

    防止吃河豚鱼中毒
    读者秦北海、张吉甫等来信反映，山东省羊角沟有渔民七人因为吃河豚鱼中毒，其中有两人死亡。读者沈剑来信建议各地应采取措施，防止吃河豚鱼中毒事故的发生。本报同农业部水产管理总局研究后，认为防止吃河豚鱼中毒现象是值得引起各地群众深切注意的问题。
    河豚鱼（在山东和东北地区叫?巴鱼，福建叫?鱼或鬼仔鱼，广东叫鸡抱）是一种产量较大，价格便宜，肉味鲜美的食品。这种鱼的形状像纺锤，皮肤表面光滑，没有鳞，它的生殖腺（精巢和卵巢）、肝脏、肠胃，脊髓和血液里都有毒素，在春季产卵期间生殖腺的毒性更大。
    几年来，各地群众曾不断发生因误食河豚鱼中毒死亡事件；今年渔汛开始以来，广东、福建、山东、河北、武汉及乌兰浩特等地区又发生十一件，中毒五十八人，其中死亡十九人。中毒后的症状，一般是先头晕，恶心呕吐，以后是呼吸困难，全身麻木，重的一、二小时就会死亡，死后全身发青。发生中毒事故的原因主要有下面三点：一、有些水产部门，对河豚鱼容易引起中毒的认识不足，没有向群众进行必要的宣传教育工作；二、生产单位和运销部门对渔获物处理不当，对鱼货拣选不严。如今年春季渔汛期间，旅顺地区在批发的黄花鱼中就混有河豚鱼，这种鱼运到乌兰浩特市，当地居民缺乏食用常识，根本不了解这种鱼类有毒，因而发生了中毒致死的事件。三、有的人抱着“拼死吃河豚”的盲目态度，他们明明知道河豚鱼是有毒的，但是他们贪吃这种鱼的美味，以致在烹调制作不慎的情况下中毒。
    各地水产部门以及有关部门应当重视防止食用河豚鱼中毒的宣传，向群众说明吃河豚鱼的危险性，并且介绍一些食用河豚鱼的处理方法。食用河豚鱼，先要去头剥皮，割除内脏和血块，洗净血液，然后将肉放在清水中浸洗干净，直到没有血色后，方可煎煮或腌晒鱼干，再吃。沿海沿江国营水产公司和供销合作社在加工时，必须妥慎进行去毒处理。各地水产市场，水产运销部门应严密检查鱼货中有无鲜河豚鱼混杂，如果有混杂就要分别放置，并控制鱼贩，不要随便向没有食用习惯的地区运售，出售时要告诉买主注意洗制方法，以保证安全。
