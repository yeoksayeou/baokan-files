Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau's conservation measures in construction

Our reporter, Yu Ming

The staff of the Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau, while ensuring the quality of the project, have adopted various methods in many aspects of construction, saving a lot of funds for national construction.

In the past, they only constructed according to the drawings and did not care whether the design drawings were in line with economic principles. Now, they carefully study the design drawings, and put forward rationalization proposals when they find places in the original design that did not consider savings. For example, when they recently studied the drawings of the new mine, they found that the original design used wood to support the permanent roadways. The permanent roadways of Xiejiachi Nos. 2 and 3 mines alone, which were more than 3,800 meters long, would use 3,040 cubic meters of wood, worth more than 253,000 yuan. This kind of wooden shed needs to be replaced once a year during construction, and once a year after the mine starts production. This not only wastes a lot of labor and funds every year, but also wastes wood.

After studying this situation, the Basic Construction Bureau suggested to the design department: use reinforced concrete sheds instead of wooden sheds. Using reinforced concrete sheds for more than 3,000 meters of permanent roadways only requires 380,000 yuan. Calculating on the basis of maintaining this kind of shed in the roadway for ten years, compared with wooden sheds, the accumulated cost of the wood materials replaced every year would be 1.9 million yuan. This is not only of great significance in terms of savings, but also, because reinforced concrete sheds are stronger than wooden sheds, production is safer. This suggestion has been approved by the Coal Mine Design Institute, and the design drawings for reinforced concrete sheds are now being studied. In the arch lining project in the underground roadways, according to the original design, there was a 50 mm cement filling behind the arch. After studying it, the construction department believes that the 50 mm cement filling does not play a role here, because it is too thin. After it is applied, it needs to be filled with gangue, which will destroy the cement structure, and the construction is also very difficult. Since the large arch in the well is made of bluestone, its compressive resistance has exceeded more than twice the original design. Canceling the 50 mm cement behind the arch will have no impact on the quality of the project, and it can save the country more than 100,000 yuan this year.

Many facts from the Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau show that using local materials is an important way for construction departments to save money for the country. In construction, the amount of bricks, dimension stone, sand, lime, etc. is very large. Paying attention to using local materials and improving transportation routes can save a lot of funds.

The staff dormitory being constructed by the Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau uses flagstone instead of bricks to build the walls below the windowsill. This is not only of good quality, but also saves 120 yuan per dormitory compared to building the walls entirely with bricks. They will be building hundreds of dormitories this year, and the amount of money saved by this is considerable. According to comrades from the Basic Construction Bureau, there are many places where bricks are used in basic construction, but bricks have to go through a complex manufacturing process. The cost of bricks is much higher than the cost of flagstone mined nearby. Since using flagstone is more economical than using bricks and the quality is also good, they did this after obtaining the consent of Party A.

For several years, the dimension stone, lime, etc. used by the Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau have been centrally mined and manufactured in one mountain and site, and then transported to various construction sites, with an average transportation distance of three or four kilometers; the sand used is transported from Mingguang and Guandian stations on the Jinpu Railway, hundreds of miles away. Now, by trying to mine and process locally as much as possible, a lot of funds can be saved. For example, for flagstone, in the past it was centrally mined in Bagong Mountain and Changshangkou and then distributed to various construction sites, with a transportation distance of about three kilometers. Now, it is mined in four places close to the construction sites, and the transportation distance is shortened to about one kilometer, which can save more than one yuan per cubic meter of flagstone in freight. Some of the sand used is now also mined in Yangjiaqiao, Huainan. Yangjiaqiao is only three kilometers away from the main construction site, and the freight per cubic meter of sand can be saved by more than 4.9 yuan compared to transporting it from Guandian Station, hundreds of miles away. In addition, the Basic Construction Bureau has also changed the transportation routes for stone ballast, red bricks, cement, etc. The original routes that went around the highway now take small roads; the original routes that took detours now try to take straight roads, which has also achieved savings.

Another link in the Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau's control of savings is to improve construction technology and methods and implement centralized material distribution. In the first quarter, they used the backward small-section multi-stage excavation method for tunnel construction, and did not promote large-section single excavation according to national quotas, which affected construction efficiency and delayed the progress of the project. The cost per cubic meter in excavation was several yuan higher than the national quota. Since the adoption of large-section excavation at the end of April, the blasting efficiency has been improved, and the consumption of explosives, detonators, etc. has been reduced. At the same time, due to the increase in the working face, loading gangue, ventilation, etc. are also more convenient than before. Taking Xiejiachi No. 2 Mine as an example, since the adoption of large-section gangue masonry parallel operation at the end of April, the direct cost of excavation has been reduced by 7% compared to the national quota, and the cost of masonry lining has been reduced by 8% compared to the national quota. In civil engineering, after vigorously promoting advanced experiences such as double-handed slurry extrusion, paving ash cylinders, and assembly line operations, the quotas of most teams have been increased by about 20%, so the cost of civil engineering has also begun to decrease. In terms of materials used for masonry lining, the masonry stone used in the past had to be cut to two centimeters thick, but now it is changed to three centimeters thick, which can also be used for masonry, saving a lot of labor for cutting stones. In the past, when masonry lining, it was often necessary to break the whole stone to fill the seams, but now crushed stone is transported separately to fill the seams, and breaking large stones is prohibited. This also saves a lot of labor and stone, and reduces costs. In terms of wood, the method of improving material distribution and changing the wheel saw to a band saw is used to reduce the loss of wood in the processing process. In the management of wood and steel bars, centralized processing and material distribution are implemented, which not only makes the wood and steel bars used rationally, but also avoids the phenomenon of scattered small pieces of wood and steel bars being thrown around on various construction sites. In the installation project, most of the materials used are precious steel, water pipes, wires, cables, etc. The construction personnel studied and, within the scope permitted by the design, selected the shortest path as much as possible, saving the use of wires. All of these have a role in saving the country's funds.

The Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau also has a relatively deep understanding of the important role of making technical organizational measures plans in savings. When they installed the can track beam project of the No. 2 main shaft, they did not make good technical organizational measures, resulting in more than 2,800 workers and 28 days to complete the installation task. However, when installing the can track beam project of the No. 3 main shaft, because they made good technical organizational measures in advance, incorporated advanced experience, workers' rationalization proposals, and suggestions from Soviet experts, trained the workers in advance, and actively strengthened contact with relevant departments, they completed the installation task in 13 days with a total of more than 1,800 workers, speeding up the progress by one time and saving a large amount of manpower and funds for the country. Now, the staff of the whole bureau has paid attention to this work, which will be a very important way to save money in this year's huge installation project.

The Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau did not complete the construction plan from January to April this year, but after improving the construction work from April, it overfulfilled the construction task for May by 6.8% in May, waste began to decrease, and the cost of many projects began to decrease. According to statistics, the above-mentioned conservation measures alone can save the country more than 2 million yuan. However, these are only preliminary conservation measures. In the process of implementing these measures, the vast number of staff will come up with more ways to save funds for the country.

It can be seen from this that the staff of the construction department have many ways to save a lot of construction funds for the country while ensuring the quality of the project. This spirit of thinking of ways to save funds for the country in every link is worthy of promotion.

    淮南煤矿基本建设局在施工中的节约措施
    本报记者　于明
    淮南煤矿基本建设局的职工们，在保证工程质量的条件下，在施工的许多环节上采取了各种办法，为国家建设节约了大量资金。
    过去，他们只是照图施工，对于设计图纸是否合乎经济原则却不过问。现在，他们认真地学习设计图纸，发现原设计中没有考虑到节约的地方就提出合理化建议。例如最近他们在研究新建矿井的图纸时，发现原设计中开拓永久巷道都是用木料架棚子，仅谢家集二、三号井三千八百多公尺长的永久巷道，就要用三千零四十立方公尺木料，折价二十五万三千多元。这种用木料架的棚子，不仅在施工过程中每年需要更换一次，而且在矿井开始生产以后，每年还要更换一次。这样做，不但每年要浪费许多劳动力和资金；而且在木料的使用上也是很浪费的。
    基本建设局在研究这种情况后，就向设计部门提出建议：用钢筋水泥棚子代替木棚。用钢筋水泥棚子，三千多公尺的永久巷道，只需三十八万元，以这种棚子在巷道中以维持十年来计算，同木棚比较，只是节省逐年所换的木料费用累计就达一百九十万元。这样不但在节约上有很大意义，而且，由于钢筋水泥棚子比木棚结实，生产也更加安全了。这项建议已经得到了煤矿设计院的同意，现在正在研究钢筋水泥棚子的设计图样。在井下巷道砌碹工程中，按原设计，碹后有五十公厘的水泥充填。施工部门研究以后，认为五十公厘的水泥充填在这里并不起作用，因为它太薄，抹上以后，又需用矸石充填，会破坏水泥结构，同时施工也很困难；由于井下大碹是用青石砌碹，它的抗压力已超过原设计的一倍以上，取消碹后五十公厘的水泥，对工程质量毫无影响，并且今年就可为国家节约十万多元。
    淮南煤矿基本建设局的许多事实，说明就地取材是施工部门为国家节约的重要途径。在建筑中，砖、料石、砂子、石灰等的用量很大，注意就地取材，改进运输路线，就能节约很多资金。
    淮南煤矿基本建设局承建的正在施工的职工宿舍，窗台以下部分，都用片石代替砖来砌墙，不但质量很好，而且每栋宿舍可比完全用砖砌墙节省一百二十元。今年他们还要承建数百栋宿舍，这项节约的资金数量是很可观的。据基本建设局的同志谈：在基本建设中用砖的地方很多，而砖却是要经过复杂的制造过程的，砖的成本，比就近开采的片石要大得多。用片石既然比用砖经济，质量又好，所以他们征得甲方同意以后，就这样作了。
    淮南煤矿基本建设局，几年来所用的料石、白灰等，都是集中在一个山、场开采和制造，然后运往各工地，平均运输距离都有三、四公里；所用的砂子则是从数百里以外的津浦路明光、管店站运来的。现在尽量就地开采、加工，就能大大节约资金。例如片石一项，过去是在八公山、常山口两地集中开采后再分送到各工地，运输距离在三公里左右；现在分在四个靠近工地的地方开采，运输距离缩短到一公里左右，每立方公尺片石最多的可节约一元多运费。所用砂子现在也有一部分在淮南的杨家桥开采了，杨家桥离主要工地只三公里，每立方公尺砂子的运费比从数百里外管店站运来可节省四元九角多。另外，基本建设局还改变了石碴、红砖、水泥等的运输路线，原来绕行公路的现在改走小路；原来是走弯路的，现在尽量设法走直路，也收到了节约的效果。
    淮南煤矿基本建设局掌握的另一个节约环节，就是改进建筑技术和建筑方法，实行集中配料。他们在第一季度井巷建筑中采用的是落后的小断面分次掘进法，没有按照国家定额推行大断面一次掘进，因而影响了建筑效率，推迟了工程进度，在掘进中每立方公尺的费用比国家定额多好几元。自从四月底开始采用大断面掘进以后，提高了爆破效率，降低了炸药、雷管等的消耗。同时，由于工作面增大，装矸、通风等也比以往方便。以谢家集二号井为例，自四月底采用大断面矸砌平行作业后，使掘进直接成本比国家定额降低百分之七，砌碹成本比国家定额降低百分之八。在土建工程中大力推行了双手挤浆、铺灰筒、流水作业等先进经验以后，绝大部分小组的定额都提高了百分之二十左右，所以土建工程的成本也开始降低了。在砌碹用料方面，过去所用砌碹石，一律都要打成二公分厚，现在改用三公分厚的，也一样能砌，省去了许多打石头的人工。过去砌碹时，常常为了填缝，需要把整块石头打碎用，现在则另外运来碎石头填缝，而禁止打碎大石头，这也节省了许多人工和石料，降低了成本。在木材方面，是以改进配料方法和把轮锯改作带锯的方法，来减低木材在加工过程中的损耗。在木材和钢筋的管理上，都实行集中加工和配料，不但可使木材、钢筋得到合理使用，而且避免了分散在各工地乱丢碎小木材和钢筋的现象。在安装工程中，所用材料，大部分是珍贵的钢铁、水管、电线、电缆等，施工人员研究在设计许可的范围内，尽可能选取最短捷的路径，节省了线材的使用。所有这些，对节约国家的资金都是有作用的。
    淮南煤矿基本建设局，对作好技术组织措施计划在节约上的重大作用，也有了比较深刻的认识。他们在安装二号主井罐道梁工程时，没有作好技术组织措施，结果用工二千八百多个，二十八天才完成安装任务。但是在安装三号主井罐道梁工程时，因为事先做好了技术组织措施，把先进经验、职工合理化建议和苏联专家的建议，都编了进去，事先训练了工人，又主动加强了跟有关部门的联系，在十三天内共用了一千八百多个工就完成了安装任务，加快进度一倍，为国家节约了大批的人力和资金。现在，全局职工已注意了这项工作，在今年的巨大安装工程中，这将是一个很重要的节约途径。
    淮南煤矿基本建设局在今年一至四月没有完成施工计划，但是从四月开始改进施工工作以后，五月份已超额百分之六点八完成了五月份的施工任务，浪费开始减少，许多项目的成本开始降低了。只上面谈到的节约措施，据统计，就可为国家节约资金二百多万元。但是，这只是初步的节约措施，在这些措施实行过程中，广大职工将会想出更多的办法来为国家节约资金。
    由此可见，施工部门的职工们是有着很多的途径，在保证工程质量的条件下，为国家大量节约建筑资金的。这种在每一个环节上都想法为国家节约资金的精神，是值得提倡的。
