    The Ugly Face of Jia Zhifang, a Key Member of the Hu Feng Clique
    By our reporter Xi Ping
    Before Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes were exposed, some well-intentioned people mistakenly believed that Hu Feng's problem was merely a debate over literary ideas, not a political problem, a counter-revolutionary problem. But many facts revealed today tell us that this is not the case. Here, we expose some of the activities of Jia Zhifang, one of the important members of the Hu Feng clique. From Jia Zhifang, we can also see the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.
    As early as a dozen years ago, Jia Zhifang began his sinful activities against the Communist Party and the people. He worked as an officer in the Kuomintang reactionary army, as an editor of the "Saodang Daily," a mouthpiece of the Kuomintang military intelligence system, and as an inspector in the Kuomintang's anti-revolutionary agency, the News Inspection Bureau, which specialized in inspecting progressive books and periodicals. In 1942, Jia Zhifang also participated in bandit armed forces in Shanxi, and in 1945, he became an apprentice of Wang Santaiye, a big gangster boss, in Haizhou, northern Jiangsu.
    This element, who consistently opposed the revolution, suddenly went into seclusion two years before liberation and specialized in "literary" activities. After the national liberation, he took on the appearance of a progressive cultural figure and, through Hu Feng's introduction, sneaked into the Chinese Department of Aurora University in the summer of 1950. After the adjustment of university departments in 1952, he transferred to Fudan University and obtained the important position of professor in the Chinese Department of Fudan University and director of the Modern Literature Teaching and Research Group.
    For the past four or five years, Jia Zhifang has been desperately "connecting with people," "winning people over," and "engaging in pioneering work." He has always disguised himself as a "professor" who is enthusiastic about cultivating young people, and he has lured a group of young students with insufficient political experience into his trap. Jia Zhifang's methods of engaging in these activities were diverse and well-planned. He started by "taking care" of the students' daily lives. Soon after arriving at Fudan University, Jia Zhifang visited the students' dormitories, and then invited those he considered "satisfactory" to his home, treated them to meals, took photos with them, and sometimes even gave them money to use, telling the students to treat his home "as their own." In this extensive contact, Jia Zhifang learned about the students' family situations and personality traits, and thus he selected a group of "satisfactory" students. Jia Zhifang treated these students he considered "satisfactory" differently. He carefully corrected their articles, selected topics, and even contacted publishers for them. Jia Zhifang knew that young people are easily overwhelmed by excessive praise. Therefore, even though these people's articles were not well written, Jia Zhifang praised them when correcting their articles, saying, "Your article is not formulaic," "From the article, it seems that you have a kind subjective world. It would be even better if you could embrace the objective world with this subjective world." Sometimes he also said, "Your article is of national level and should be actively submitted," to encourage students to submit articles to newspapers or periodicals. When publishing houses or newspapers returned some unsuitable manuscripts, he took the opportunity to make a big deal out of it. Jia Zhifang described this reasonable handling of manuscripts as "the literary world being ruled by sectarianism and philistinism," thereby inciting students' dissatisfaction with the Party. Jia Zhifang patted his chest and said, "If they don't publish it, I'll find a way for you." Thus, Jia Zhifang helped these people establish connections with the "Mud Society," a publishing organization of the Hu Feng clique. These people were naturally grateful for Jia Zhifang's enthusiastic care. Over time, some pure young people fell into the quagmire he had prepared in advance. In this struggle to expose Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes, according to investigations, in the Chinese Department of Fudan University, not only were there young students, but also young members of the Communist Youth League, and even Communist Party members, who were induced and utilized by him.
    Jia Zhifang systematically spread idealistic and reactionary ideas among the vast number of young students at Fudan University, preventing them from coming into contact with progressive theories, and creating confusion in their minds. Last year, when he was teaching the "Soviet Literature" course, it was originally stipulated that Russian literature would be taught in the first semester and Soviet literature in the second semester. However, in the one hundred and fourteen hours of these two semesters, Jia Zhifang spent nearly one hundred hours teaching Russian literature, and he distorted these classical works with bourgeois idealistic and reactionary viewpoints. He often preached to students that "creation can also be carried out based on individual intuition, and writers do not necessarily have to master a scientific worldview, nor do they necessarily have to delve into life." This year, the school organized the study of important documents related to the Second All-Soviet Writers Congress. Jia Zhifang did not organize students to first study the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Congress and other important documents. Instead, he deliberately had students study the speeches with different opinions at the Congress. He viciously described this mutual working discussion among Soviet writers as "Moscow writers and non-Moscow writers quarreling with each other." He also said with ulterior motives: "The Soviet Union is like this, can China be an exception?" Jia Zhifang is a professor of modern Chinese literature, but he rudely denigrated famous works of modern Chinese literature and famous progressive writers and Party member writers. He also sang the same tune as other Hu Feng elements, calling Mao Dun's "Midnight," an outstanding work of modern literature since the "May Fourth" Movement, a pornographic and obscene novel; and calling "Ma Fantuo Mountain Song," which played a fighting role during the Third Revolutionary Civil War, "vulgar stuff of petty citizens." He insulted many Communist and non-Communist progressive writers. In front of students, he tried every means to recommend the reactionary and erroneous works of Hu Feng elements such as Lu Ling, Geng Yong, and A Long. For the past four or five years, this ideological poison has eroded the minds of young students like malignant bacteria.
    Jia Zhifang's activities at Fudan University were part of the Hu Feng clique's reactionary activities. They were extremely closely linked. When criticism of the errors of "Literary Gazette" was launched in Beijing, the Shanghai "Liberation Daily" also held a symposium for literary and art circles, inviting representative figures from literary and art circles to express their opinions. Just as Hu Feng defended Lu Ling and A Long at the joint enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the China Writers Association, Jia Zhifang instructed his "students" to defend Hu Feng element Geng Yong's obviously erroneous "'The True Story of Ah Q' Research" at the meeting. This student, under his instruction, described the "Literary Monthly"'s just criticism of this book as a "personal attack on Geng Yong himself," and called the "Literary Monthly" a "philistine" and "aristocratic" publication. At the same time, after the meeting, Jia Zhifang asked his wife Ren Min's nephew—a middle school student under the age of eighteen—to submit an article to the "Literary Monthly" to speak up for Geng Yong. In Hu Feng's words, this method of fighting was "flags all over the mountains" and "laying out a suspicious formation." This insidious tactic became even more blatant when the struggle touched on the Hu Feng issue. After "People's Daily" published Comrade Zhou Yang's article "We Must Fight," Jia Zhifang became even more nervous. On the one hand, he organized "students" to submit articles to "People's Daily" to attack Comrade Zhou Yang's article and defend Hu Feng. On the other hand, he and Hu Feng elements Geng Yong, Zhang Yu, and Luo Luo in Shanghai secretly gathered to plan an attack. At the same time, he systematically spread various rumors in the school, portraying Hu Feng's anti-people and counter-revolutionary activities over the past twenty years as "consistently active and enthusiastic" towards the revolution. After a portion of Hu Feng's 300,000-word opinion letter was publicly published with the "Literary Gazette," Hu Feng elements Geng Yong, Luo Luo, Zhang Yu, Mei Lin, and Jia Zhifang in Shanghai held a banquet at the Jinjiang Hotel. At the meeting, Jia Zhifang raised his glass and proposed a toast to the health of Hu Feng, the head of the counter-revolutionary clique.
    Just as Hu Feng himself confessed: they were "blinded by optimistic estimates and finally rushed forward," Jia Zhifang's blessing for Hu Feng was a bit premature. Soon, Beijing, Shanghai, and even the national literary and art circles launched a criticism of Hu Feng's ideology, and various organs, groups, and schools also launched a study on criticizing idealism and learning materialism. Jia Zhifang adopted a planned retreat. He tried his best to cope with and shirk this study, and even was unwilling to listen to reports related to the study. But behind the scenes, he was still actively engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. Jia Zhifang usually kept his deep relationship with Hu Feng a secret, but behind his back, he said to his subordinates: "I have a long history in the Hu Feng faction. This is a fighting literary faction. I am honored to be under its banner!" Jia Zhifang also spread lies like those in Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism," saying: "Before liberation, Hu Feng was a revolutionary petty-bourgeois writer. If all his works are criticized, most of the Chinese writers are revolutionary petty-bourgeois writers, then there are too many works to be criticized." At this time, the school authorities of Fudan University wanted him to express his views on the Hu Feng issue, and the Shanghai branch of the China Writers Association wanted him to express his views. He could no longer pretend to be dead, so he pretended to do a "self-examination" according to Hu Feng's instructions. At a business meeting of the Chinese Department Teaching and Research Group of Fudan University, Jia Zhifang gave an amazingly lengthy report. The report quoted countless aphorisms and famous sayings, but he did not talk about what involvement he had with Hu Feng. Not only did he not explain anything, but he also used this fake self-examination as a means of attack. After reporting within the Chinese Department, he sent the report to the "People's Daily." The "People's Daily" returned his manuscript, asking him to write some information about the activities of the Hu Feng clique. Jia Zhifang was overjoyed to receive this rejection letter, and said everywhere, "Okay! It's not that I don't self-examine, but that they don't want me to self-examine. I have already filed a case with the 'People's Daily'!" Soon, the Shanghai branch of the China Writers Association began a discussion meeting to criticize Hu Feng. Jia Zhifang took a small part of the report and read it verbatim. Afterwards, Jia Zhifang said to another Hu Feng element that his self-examination was for "self-defense," and that the content of the report was "nonsense." Now is the time for Jia Zhifang and other Hu Feng elements to wake up. You must take off your masks and thoroughly confess to the Party and the people. This is your only way out.

    胡风集团骨干分子贾植芳的丑恶面目
    本报记者　习平
    当胡风的反革命罪行未揭发前，曾经有些好心的人误以为胡风问题不过是文艺思想的争论，而不是一个政治问题，一个反革命问题。但今天揭发出来的许多事实告诉了我们不是这样。这里，我们揭发胡风集团重要成员之一的贾植芳的一些活动，从贾植芳的身上，我们也能看到胡风反革命集团的真正面目。
    贾植芳远在十几年前，就开始了反对共产党、反对人民的罪恶活动。他做过国民党反动军队中的军官，做过国民党军统系统的机关报“扫荡报”的编辑，他还做过国民党专门检查进步书报刊物的反动机关新闻检查局的检查官。一九四二年贾植芳还在山西参加土匪武装，一九四五年在苏北的海州拜了一个大流氓头子王三太爷为师父。
    这个一贯反对革命的分子，在解放前二年，忽然隐居起来，专门从事“文学”活动。在全国解放后，他就以进步文化人面貌，由胡风介绍，在一九五○年夏季混进了震旦大学中文系。一九五二年大学院系调整后，转入复旦大学，并取得了复旦大学中文系教授和现代文学教研组主任的重要职位。
    四、五年来，贾植芳拼命“联络人”，“争取人”，“从事开辟工作”。他一直在群众中把自己打扮成一个热心培养青年的“教授”，把一批政治经验不足的青年学生诱进了他的圈套。贾植芳在从事这些活动时，表现的方式是多种多样的，是十分有计划的。他首先从“照顾”学生的生活细节入手。贾植芳在到复旦大学不久就参观了学生的宿舍，然后把自己认为“满意”的人请到自己的家里去，请他们吃饭、请他们照相，有时还给钱他们用，叫学生把他的家“当成自己的家”。在这种广泛的接触中，贾植芳从学生口中了解了学生的家庭情况和性格特点，这样，贾植芳就物色了一批“满意的”学生。对于这些他认为“满意的”学生，贾植芳是另眼看待的，他仔细地给他们批改文章，选定题目，甚至还为他们接洽出版事宜。贾植芳知道青年人容易为过份的捧场冲昏头脑，因此，尽管这些人的文章写得不好，贾植芳在批改文章时还称赞道：“你的文章写得不公式化”，“从文章看来你有善良的主观世界，如果你能用这种主观世界拥抱客观世界就更好。”有时他还说：“你的文章有全国水平，应该积极投稿”，来怂恿学生向报纸或刊物投稿；而当出版社或报社把一些不合用的稿件退回来时，他就借着这个题目大事发挥。贾植芳把这种合理处理稿件的现象说成是“文坛给宗派、市侩统治住了”，借以煽动学生对党的不满。贾植芳并拍拍胸脯说：“他们不出，我替你们想办法。”于是贾植芳就替这些人到胡风集团的出版机构“泥土社”拉关系。这些人对贾植芳这种热心关怀，自然是感激涕零，天长日久，一些纯洁的青年就掉入了他预先设好的泥坑。在这次揭露胡风反革命罪行的斗争中，据已经查明的，在复旦大学中文系不但有青年学生，而且其中还有青年团员，甚至有共产党员，被他所引诱利用。
    贾植芳在复旦大学有计划地向广大青年学生散布唯心主义的反动思想，而不让他们接触进步的理论，造成他们的思想混乱。去年他在教“苏联文学”课程时，原来规定上学期教俄罗斯文学，下学期教苏联文学，但是在这两学期的一百十四个小时中，贾植芳教俄罗斯文学占去了近一百小时，并且用资产阶级唯心主义的反动观点来曲解这些古典作品。他经常向学生宣扬“凭了个人的直观也可以进行创作，作家不一定要掌握科学的世界观，也不一定去深入生活。”今年学校组织了关于第二次全苏作家代表大会中有关重要文件的学习，贾植芳不组织学生首先学习苏联共产党中央委员会给代表大会的贺电和其他重要文件，却故意地要学生学习代表大会上有不同意见的发言。他把这种苏联作家间相互工作上的探讨，恶毒地说成是“莫斯科作家和非莫斯科作家间的相互吵嘴”。他还别有用心的说：“苏联是这样，中国还能例外？”贾植芳是中国现代文学的教授，但是他对中国现代文学的名著和有名的进步作家和党员作家，却粗暴地加以诋毁。他也和其他的胡风分子唱着同样的曲调，把茅盾的“子夜”这部“五四”以来的现代文学的杰出作品说成是一部色情、黄色小说；把曾经在第三次国内革命战争期间起过战斗作用的“马凡陀山歌”，说成是
  “小市民庸俗的东西”。他谩骂许多共产党的和非党的进步作家。他在学生面前想尽一切办法推荐胡风分子如路翎、耿庸、阿垅等的反动、错误的作品。四、五年来，这种思想毒素，犹如恶性病菌一样侵蚀到青年学生的心里。
  贾植芳在复旦的活动，是胡风集团反动活动的一部分，他们是异常紧密地联系着的。当北京开展了关于“文艺报”错误的批评后，上海“解放日报”也召开了一个文艺界的座谈会，邀请文艺界的有代表性的人物发表意见。如同胡风在中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团的联席扩大会议上为路翎和阿垅辩护一样，贾植芳指示了他的“学生”在会上为胡风分子耿庸的显然错误的“‘阿Q正传’研究”进行辩护。这个受他指示的学生在会上把当初“文艺月报”对这本书的公正的批评，说成是“文艺月报”对“耿庸本人的人身攻击”，并把“文艺月报”说成是“市侩”、“贵族”的刊物。同时在会后贾植芳叫他的妻子任敏的侄子——一个不满十八岁的中学生，向“文艺月报”投稿，为耿庸鸣不平。用胡风的话来说，这种作战方法是“看来遍山旗帜”“布得成疑阵”。这种阴险的手段在斗争接触到胡风问题时就更为露骨。从“人民日报”发表了周扬同志的“我们必须战斗”的文章后，贾植芳就更加紧张起来，一方面他组织了“学生”向“人民日报”投稿，攻击周扬同志的文章，为胡风辩护，另外一方面他和在上海的胡风分子耿庸、张禹、罗洛等秘密集会，策划进攻。同时他自己在学校中有计划地散布各种谣言，把胡风二十多年来的一直从事的反人民、反革命活动描写成是对革命的“一贯积极热情”。胡风的三十万字意见书中的一部分随“文艺报”公开发表后，上海的胡风分子耿庸、罗洛、张禹、梅林和贾植芳等在锦江饭店举行宴会，会上，贾植芳举杯起立建议为反革命集团的首脑胡风的健康干杯。
    正像胡风自己所招认的：他们“被乐观估计所蔽，终于冒进”，贾植芳为胡风祝福得也嫌过早了些。不久，北京、上海以至全国文艺界开展对胡风思想的批判，各机关、各团体学校也开展了关于批判唯心论学习唯物论的学习，贾植芳就采取了有计划的退却。他对这次学习尽量地应付和推托，甚至连有关学习的报告也不愿意去听。而在幕后，他却依然积极地进行着反革命的活动。贾植芳对同胡风的深远关系，平日是讳莫如深，但在背后，对他的部下说：“我在胡风派有长期的历史，这是一个战斗的文学派别，我以在它的旗帜下为光荣！”贾植芳还散布出如同胡风的“我的自我批判”中的谎言一样，说：“解放前胡风是革命的小资产阶级作家，如果他的作品都批判了，中国的作家大多是革命的小资产阶级作家，那么要批判的作品就太多了。”这时，复旦大学的校方要他就胡风问题发表自己的意见，中国作家协会上海分会要他表示意见。他不能再装死了，于是就根据胡风的指示，假惺惺地做起“自我检讨”来了。在一次复旦大学中文系教研组的业务会议上，贾植芳就做了一场惊人冗长的报告，报告引用了数不尽的警句名言，但是他自己同胡风到底有些什么瓜葛，却什么也没有讲。他不但什么也没有交代，反而把这种假检讨作为进攻的手段，在中文系内报告完了以后，他就把这份报告送到“人民日报”。“人民日报”退回了他的稿子，要他写一些有关胡风集团活动的情况。贾植芳在得到这份退稿信后，如获至宝，到处说“好了！这可不是我不检讨，而是他们不要我检讨，我已经向‘人民日报’备过案了！”不久，中国作家协会上海分会开始了批判胡风的讨论会，贾植芳又拿报告中的一小部分到那里照本宣读了一下。事后贾植芳在另一个胡风分子面前说：他的这种检讨是为了“自卫”，至于报告的内容那是“胡扯”。现在该是贾植芳及其他胡风分子清醒的时候了。你们必须把自己的假面具揭下来，彻底向党和人民交代，这是你们唯一的出路。
