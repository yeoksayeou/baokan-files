Huangqiao Oil Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Jiangsu Province, with the assistance of the Provincial Department of Industry, has recently successfully experimented with a manual double-pressing method for extracting rapeseed oil. Previously, the average residual oil rate in dry cakes from manual rapeseed pressing in Jiangsu Province was around 10%. Using the new method, the residual oil rate in dry cakes has been reduced to below 7.5%, with the lowest reaching 6.5%. If the average residual oil rate is 7.5%, Jiangsu Province could increase rapeseed oil production by approximately 1 million jin this year.

The process of this method is as follows: remove mud and ash from the rapeseed, and after the first rolling, properly heat and steam the embryo, so that the moisture content of the embryo entering the press reaches 8% to 8.5%, and the temperature is above 100 degrees Celsius. Carry out the first pressing to extract more than 60% of the oil content of the raw material. Then, crush and grind the cake, heat it to reduce the moisture content of the embryo to about 5%, and the temperature is between 90 and 95 degrees Celsius. Perform the second steaming, after which the moisture content of the embryo should be around 7%, and the temperature should be above 100 degrees Celsius, before performing the second pressing. This way, more oil can be extracted. Experiments have proven that this method can also reduce the residual oil rate in peanut dry cakes when used to extract peanut kernels.

The factory has now summarized the experience of this new operational method and has formulated an operational method for manual rapeseed pressing.

    黄桥油厂用两次压榨法榨菜籽
    江苏省地方国营黄桥油厂在省工业厅协助下，最近试验人力榨菜籽两次压榨的操作方法成功了。过去江苏省人力榨菜籽平均干饼残油率在百分之十左右，这次用新的操作方法榨菜籽，干饼残油率降低到百分之七点五以下，最低时降低到百分之六点五；如果平均残油率为百分之七点五，江苏省今年就可以增产菜油一百万斤左右。
    这种操作方法的过程是：把菜籽除去泥灰，经过第一次轧胚，再经适当加热、蒸胚，使入榨胚的水分达到百分之八到百分之八点五，温度在摄氏一百度以上，进行第一次压榨，榨取占原料含油率百分之六十以上的油；然后再把饼轧碎轧细，经过加热使胚的水分降低到百分之五左右，温度在摄氏九十到九十五度，进行第二次蒸胚，蒸后胚的水分应在百分之七左右，温度在摄氏一百度以上，再进行第二次压榨。这样就能榨出更多的油。经试验证明，用这种方法榨花生仁，也可以降低花生仁干饼残油率。
    现在这个厂已经总结了这次试验新操作法的经验，拟订了人力榨菜籽的操作方法。
