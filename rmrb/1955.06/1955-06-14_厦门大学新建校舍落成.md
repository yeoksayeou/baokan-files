    New School Buildings Completed at Xiamen University
    The new school buildings of Xiamen University were all completed by the end of May this year.
    The newly built school buildings include twenty-one large buildings and ten small buildings, covering an area of more than 52,800 square meters, which is more than twice the area built in the twenty-nine years before liberation. In addition to the department-specific buildings such as the Biology Building, Chemistry Building, and Physics Building, as well as student dormitories, faculty dormitories, large canteens, and hospitals, the new school buildings also include an auditorium that can accommodate 5,000 people, a library that can accommodate 1,500 people for simultaneous reading, and a new sports field with an area of more than 19,000 square meters.
    The new school buildings of Xiamen University were built with the enthusiastic care of patriotic overseas Chinese. Half of the school's original buildings were destroyed by Japanese imperialism during the War of Resistance Against Japan. After liberation, the Higher Education Department of the Central People's Government successively allocated funds for repairs. In 1950, Mr. Chen Jiageng, the founder of Xiamen University and a leader of overseas Chinese, donated funds and raised more than 2.4 million yuan from overseas Chinese in Nanyang to build Xiamen University.

    厦门大学新建校舍落成
    厦门大学的新校舍已在今年五月底全部建成。
    新建的校舍计有大型校舍二十一座、小型校舍十座，面积达五万二千八百多平方公尺，等于解放前二十九年所建筑的面积两倍多。新校舍除了系科专用的生物馆、化学馆、物理馆等楼房和学生宿舍、教员宿舍、大型食堂、医院等外，还有能容纳五千人的大礼堂、可供一千五百人同时阅览的图书馆和面积达一万九千多平方公尺的新运动场。
    厦门大学新校舍是在爱国华侨的热情关怀下建成的。学校原有校舍有一半在抗日战争中被日本帝国主义破坏。解放后，中央人民政府高等教育部曾陆续拨款修建。一九五○年原厦门大学创办人华侨领袖陈嘉庚先生捐款并向南洋华侨募款共二百四十多万元，修建厦门大学。
