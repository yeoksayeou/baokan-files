    In the Vast Dagu Salt Fields
    Mu Huating
    On the vast plain on the western shore of Bohai Bay, neatly arranged square pools shimmer in the sunlight – these are the salt fields of the nationally renowned state-owned Dagu Salt Field. During April, May, and June, the salt industry is at its peak production season, and the salt fields are a hive of activity. Workers are busy, and the produced sea salt has already been piled into small mountains.
    This year, the Dagu Salt Field has a heavy production task; the state plan is more than 67 percent higher than the actual output in 1954. To ensure the completion and strive for over-fulfillment of the state plan, as early as January, the staff and workers braved the freezing cold of five or six degrees below zero and carried out preparatory work for production on the windy coast. They put on rubber boots, wore cotton gloves, overcame various difficulties, and carried out brine cultivation and pond repair work, cultivating a large amount of brine, and repairing the ponds to a mirror-like smoothness. By the end of March, more than 90 percent of the crystallization ponds had been filled.
    In April, the weather turned warmer, and the official salt-drying season arrived. The staff and workers enthusiastically launched a labor competition centered on increasing production. Direct production workers, transport workers, and even office staff joined the competition. From dawn onwards, the sound of salt raking could be heard everywhere. The workers of Li Jintang's team in Workshop One, adopted the advanced experience of one-day brine filling and assembly line raking and lifting in the competition, established a scientific division of labor system, and as a result, shortened the operation process and extended the crystallization time. In April, they completed more than 122 percent of the state plan and won the glorious title of Outstanding Team. Wang Hongen, a production worker, created a salt-raking clod-breaking machine, which, with the help of his comrades, was finally successful. The test results showed that it could improve work efficiency by more than three times, and it is now being promoted throughout the field. The staff and workers have demonstrated an active creative spirit, and proposed 32 rationalization proposals in April alone.
    As of May 25, the entire field had completed more than 41 percent of the annual plan. Now the staff and workers are working even harder to strive for an increase of 35,000 tons of sea salt for the whole year.

    在辽阔的大沽盐场
    穆华亭
    在渤海湾西岸辽阔的平原上，密布着整整齐齐的方格式的水池子，被太阳照耀得闪闪发光，这就是闻名全国的国营大沽盐场的盐田。四、五、六月间，正逢盐业旺产季节，盐场上一片紧张劳动的景象。工人们正在忙碌着，所生产的海盐已经堆积成一座座的小山。
    大沽盐场今年生产任务繁重，国家计划比一九五四年实产量高百分之六十七多。职工们为了保证完成和争取超额完成国家计划，早在一月间就冒着零下五、六度的严寒，在多风的海岸上进行着生产前的准备工作。他们穿上胶靴、戴上棉手套，克服了各种困难，进行养卤修池工作，养出了大量卤水，池子修整得像镜面一样光亮。到了三月底，结晶池子已经灌齐百分之九十以上。
    四月天气转暖，正式晒盐的季节到了。职工们热烈地开展了以增产为中心的劳动竞赛。直接生产工人、运输工人直到科室工作人员，都投入竞赛。拂晓开始，就到处是一片哗哗的扒盐声。一车间李金堂小组的工人们，在竞赛中采用了一天一灌卤和扒抬流水作业的先进经验，建立了科学的分工制度，结果缩短了操作过程，延长了结晶时间，四月份完成国家计划百分之一百二十二多，获得了优胜小组的光荣称号。生产工人王洪恩创造的扒盐破碴机，在同志们的帮助下，终于成功了，试验结果可以提高工作效率三倍以上，现在已经在全场推广。职工们发挥了积极的创造精神，仅四月份就提出合理化建议三十二条。
    到五月二十五日止，全场已经完成年计划的百分之四十一以上。现在职工们正更加紧张地为全年增产三万五千吨海盐而奋斗。
