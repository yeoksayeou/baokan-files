    The three batches of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily" expose that many core members of this counter-revolutionary clique have had close ties with the Kuomintang's special agent organs of imperialism for a long time. They have consistently hated the people and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. We must thoroughly eliminate this group and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements and impose severe legal sanctions on them.
    Through studying the "People's Daily" editorial of June 10th and several editor's notes, we can recognize that the theoretical foundation of counter-revolutionary elements is bourgeois idealism. Of course, the vast majority of people who suffer from idealism are not counter-revolutionary elements, but counter-revolutionary elements must be extreme idealists. Therefore, in this struggle, we must not only expose and purge Hu Feng elements and all counter-revolutionary elements, but also thoroughly expose the reactionary essence of bourgeois idealism, and on the ideological front, defeat idealist thought with materialist thought. These two things are closely linked, inseparable, and mutually influencing and promoting. Conducting a relentless struggle against bourgeois idealism on the ideological front can also help us discover the enemy. The true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was gradually exposed in several rectification campaigns before and after liberation, that is, in the past few ideological struggles.
    In addition, as far as we intellectuals are concerned, having subjective idealist thoughts will at least lead to a path of narrow personal heroism. Such people will disregard the laws of the development of things, ignore social progress, overemphasize the role of the individual, and cause losses to the people in their work. Therefore, for friends who have made subjective idealist mistakes in their thinking, we must help them conduct thorough criticism. Especially important is that we must deeply examine ourselves to prevent ourselves from unconsciously becoming prisoners of idealism, so that all of us can improve our thinking in this movement and better serve socialist construction.

    胡风事件给我们的教训
  　赵忠尧
      “人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，揭露了这个反革命集团里的许多骨干分子很早以来就同帝国主义国民党的特务机关有密切的联系。他们一贯仇视人民，进行反革命活动。我们要彻底肃清这个集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子，并且给以严厉的法律制裁。
    通过“人民日报”六月十日社论及几次编者按语的学习，我们可以认识到：反革命分子的理论基础是资产阶级唯心主义。当然，犯有唯心主义毛病的人绝大多数都不是反革命分子，但是反革命分子却一定是极端的唯心论者。因此，我们在这次斗争中，不仅要将胡风分子和一切反革命分子都揭露出来，清洗出去，而且还要彻底揭露资产阶级唯心主义的反动本质，在思想战线上，以唯物主义思想战胜唯心主义思想。这两件事是密切联系不可分割、并且是互相影响、互相推进的。在思想战线上对资产阶级唯心主义进行无情的斗争，也可以帮助我们发现敌人。胡风反革命集团的真面目，就是在解放前和解放后的几次整风，即过去的几次思想斗争中逐步暴露出来的。
    另外，就我们知识分子自己来讲，有了主观唯心主义的思想，至少会走上狭隘的个人英雄主义的道路。这样的人，就会不管事物发展的规律，忽视社会的进步，过分强调个人的作用，在工作上就会给人民带来损失。因此，对于思想上犯了主观唯心主义毛病的朋友，我们要帮助他彻底地进行批判，尤其重要的是：必须深刻检查自己，防止自己不自觉地做了唯心主义的俘虏，以使我们大家在这个运动中，思想上得到提高，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
