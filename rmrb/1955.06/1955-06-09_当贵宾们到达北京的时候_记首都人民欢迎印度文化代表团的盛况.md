    When the Distinguished Guests Arrived in Beijing
    ——A Record of the Grand Occasion of the Capital's People Welcoming the Indian Cultural Delegation
    By Our Correspondent Fu Dong
    On the afternoon of the 8th, the people of the capital welcomed the arrival of the Indian Cultural Delegation with deep friendship.
    Although the notification said that the plane would arrive after 3 o'clock, people arrived at the airport very early. Today, those who came to the airport to welcome the distinguished guests were not dozens or hundreds, but six thousand people. Among them were writers, artists, singers and dancers, representatives of ethnic minorities, youth representatives, and many Young Pioneers wearing red scarves. …
    At 3:50 PM, the first plane appeared in the sky above Beijing Airport. The airport suddenly erupted, people enthusiastically clapping their hands, waving bouquets towards the sky, and girls danced and shouted on the ground.
    When the head of the Indian Cultural Delegation, Mr. Anil Kumar Chanda, walked off the plane, the welcoming crowd surged forward. A group of Young Pioneers ran over and presented large bouquets of flowers to the distinguished guests. The airport once again erupted in deafening applause and cheers. Members of the Chinese Cultural Delegation who had visited India tightly grasped the hands of well-known Indian artists whom they recognized. Last winter, they had warmly shaken hands at the airport in Delhi, India, and today they were meeting again in Beijing.
    Then the second plane landed at the airport, followed by the third, fourth, and fifth. Applause and cheers merged into one.
    The head of the Indian delegation, members of the delegation, and responsible persons from our Ministry of Culture walked onto the welcoming platform. The solemn national anthems of China and India were played.
    Our Deputy Minister of Culture, Ding Xilin, delivered a welcoming speech. He said that the Indian delegation brought us the ancient, young, and beautiful national art of the Indian people, which has always been admired and loved by our people. They brought us the deep friendship of the Indian people towards the Chinese people.
    The head of the Indian Cultural Delegation, Mr. Chanda, gave a reply. He said that there had been a long history of cultural exchange between India and China in the past, and now this cultural exchange is even closer. He spoke of the deep friendship of the Indian people towards the Chinese people. Every time "friendship" was mentioned, people clapped long and enthusiastically.
    The delegation members walked around the airport. Applause and cheers immediately rang out from the crowd. From time to time, people ran out of the crowd to present flowers to the distinguished guests. People competed to shake hands with them, everyone wanting to express their excited feelings through a handshake. The slogan "Long live Sino-Indian friendship" shook the high sky. Even when the distinguished guests got into the car, people were still vying to reach their hands in through the windows to shake hands and greet them again.
    Everyone felt that the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people is becoming more and more consolidated, and cultural cooperation between China and India is being strengthened and expanded. And people clearly know that this friendly cooperation is the foundation for defending peace in Asia and the world.

    当贵宾们到达北京的时候
    ——记首都人民欢迎印度文化代表团的盛况
    本报记者　傅冬
    八日下午，首都的人们以深厚的友情来迎接印度文化代表团的到来。
    尽管通知说，飞机三点多才到，但人们老早就赶到了机场。今天到机场欢迎贵宾的，不是几十人，几百人，而是六千人。这里面有文学家、艺术家、歌舞家、少数民族代表、青年代表，还有不少戴着红领巾的少先队员。……
    三点五十分第一架飞机在北京机场上空出现了。机场上顿时沸腾起来，人们热情地拍着手，向天空挥动着花束，女孩子们跳舞似的在地上跳着、喊着。
    当印度文化代表团的团长阿尼尔·库马尔·钱达先生从飞机上走下来时，欢迎的人群拥上去了。一群少先队员跑过去将大把大把的鲜花献给贵宾。机场上再一次爆发出震耳的掌声、欢呼声。曾经访问过印度的中国文化代表团的团员紧紧地握着熟识的有名的印度艺术家的手，去年冬天他们在印度德里的机场上热情地握过手，今天他们在北京重新见面了。
    接着第二架飞机在机场降落了，第三架、第四架、第五架随着也都降落了。掌声、欢呼声响成一片。
    印度代表团的团长、团员和我国文化部的负责人走上了欢迎台。场上奏起了庄严的中国和印度的国歌。
    我国文化部丁西林副部长致欢迎词。他说，印度代表团给我们带来了一向为我国人民所钦佩的、所热爱的印度人民的古老而又年青、优美的民族艺术，他们给我们带来了印度人民对中国人民的深切的友情。
    印度文化代表团团长钱达先生致答词。他说，印中两国过去就有悠久的文化往来，而现在这种文化交流更加密切了。他说到印度人民对中国人民所怀的深切的友情。每次提到“友好”，人们就长长地热烈地鼓掌。
    代表团人员绕机场走了一圈。人群中立刻又响起了掌声、欢呼声。不时地有人从人群中跑出来给贵宾献花。人们争着同他们握手，人人都想通过握手来表达自己激动的感情。“中印友好万岁”的口号声震撼着高空。一直到贵宾们坐上了汽车，人们还争着从窗户口伸进手去，再一次握手，再一次问好。
    人人都这样感觉到：中印两国人民的友谊越来越巩固了，中印两国之间的文化合作正在加强、扩大。而人们清楚地知道：这种友好合作是保卫亚洲和世界和平的基础。
