Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: The Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held an expanded meeting on the 23rd. The meeting discussed the issue of trade union organizations mobilizing the broad masses of workers nationwide to implement the comprehensive thrift policy.

　　Among the heads of the sixteen industrial trade unions who participated in the meeting, seven industrial trade union leaders briefly reported on the various types of waste existing within their respective industrial systems and initially proposed methods for mobilizing workers to practice thrift.

　　The head of the National Committee of the China Electrical Workers' Union said: The principle of thrift in the electrical industry should be to ensure safe production. He cited an example: From January to May, the electricity lost due to accidents in Beijing was worth 400,000 yuan, and the losses caused to various industries were several times greater.

　　In his speech, the head of the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union pointed out: At present, the focus of thrift in the textile industry should be on saving raw cotton and improving product quality. He stated that the textile system is preparing to mobilize workers to save approximately three catties of cotton per yarn on the existing basis.

　　The head of the National Committee of the China Railway Workers' Union said: The Railway Workers' Union is preparing to launch a comprehensive thrift campaign by mobilizing workers to recycle scrap steel, formulating personal thrift plans, and implementing economic accounting.

　　The head of the National Committee of the China Heavy Industry Workers' Union pointed out in his speech: The Heavy Industry Workers' Union has summarized important experiences of blast furnaces and cement plants that can increase production and save resources, and is preparing to promote them. It also plans to launch a labor competition among blast furnaces across the country and mobilize workers to supervise and prevent various wasteful phenomena.

　　The heads of the Preparatory Committee of the China First Machine Building Workers' Union, the National Committee of the China Second Machine Building Workers' Union, and the Preparatory Committee of the China Construction Workers' Union all stated at the meeting that they had initially formulated methods for mobilizing workers to implement the thrift policy based on the specific circumstances of their respective industries.

　　Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech: Comprehensive thrift is a long-term effort, and trade union organizations at all levels should integrate the spirit of thrift into all aspects of their daily work, first and foremost into labor competitions. To this end, industrial trade unions should work with administrative departments to adopt concrete measures, inform workers of specific thrift targets and measures, and incorporate them into collective contracts and production meetings. They should also mobilize workers to promote advanced experiences, offer rationalization proposals, and solve technical problems in production to achieve these targets. Secondly, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of workers to supervise wasteful phenomena in production and to supervise illegal and undisciplined behaviors such as false production increases and false thrift. Lai Ruoyu concluded by saying: In implementing the comprehensive thrift policy, it is necessary to prevent any possible deviations and avoid any improper practices, such as neglecting workers' livelihoods or failing to provide rewards when they are due in the name of thrift.

　　In his speech, Lai Ruoyu also discussed how the national trade union organs should implement thrift.

    全国总工会书记处举行扩大会议
    讨论发动职工贯彻全面节约方针的问题
    据新华社二十三日讯　中华全国总工会书记处在二十三日举行扩大会议。会议讨论了工会组织发动全国广大职工贯彻全面节约方针的问题。
    参加这次会议的十六个产业工会的负责人中，有七个产业工会的负责人简要地报告了本产业系统存在的各种浪费情况，并初步提出了发动职工进行节约的办法。
    中国电业工会全国委员会的负责人说：电业中节约的方针应是保证安全生产。他举例说：北京市一月到五月因发生事故少送的电就值四十万元，它对各种产业所造成的损失还要多几十倍。
    中国纺织工会全国委员会负责人的发言中指出：目前纺织工业生产节约的重点，主要应是节约原棉，提高产品质量。他表示纺织系统准备发动职工，使每件纱在现有的基础上节约用棉三斤左右。
    中国铁路工会全国委员会负责人说：铁路工会准备通过发动工人回收废钢铁，制定个人节约计划，推行经济核算等办法，开展全面节约运动。
    中国重工业工会全国委员会负责人发言指出：重工业工会已总结了高炉和水泥厂可以增产节约的重要经验，准备推广，并计划发动全国高炉和高炉间的劳动竞赛，发动职工监督防止各种浪费现象。
    中国第一机械工会筹备委员会、中国第二机械工会全国委员会、中国建筑工会筹备委员会的负责人，在会上都说明已根据本产业情况，初步拟定了发动工人贯彻节约方针的办法。
    全国总工会主席赖若愚在发言中指出：全面节约是长期的，工会各级组织应把节约精神贯彻到各项日常工作中去，首先是贯彻到劳动竞赛中去。为此，各产业工会应和行政部门结合，采取具体措施，把节约指标和具体措施告诉工人，并把它作为集体合同和生产会议的内容之一，发动职工推广先进经验，提合理化建议，解决生产中的技术问题，来达到这些指标。其次，必须发动广大职工监督生产中的浪费现象，监督假增产、假节约等违法乱纪行为。赖若愚最后说：在贯彻全面节约的方针中，要防止可能产生的偏向，不能因节约而不关心职工生活或应奖励而不奖励的一切不正当的做法。
    赖若愚在发言中还谈到了全国工会机关如何贯彻节约的问题。
