Guangdong Province's supply and marketing cooperatives, in order to support farmers in the early rice's mid-season topdressing and to remedy the losses suffered by seedlings due to the spring drought, have been vigorously supplying farmers with approximately 80,000 tons of chemical fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and calcium ammonium nitrate since mid-May. After applying this batch of chemical fertilizers, in some areas, the rice seedlings that had turned yellow due to the spring drought have turned green again, promoting the seedlings' growth and development.

To organize the supply of this batch of chemical fertilizers, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to understand farmers' fertilizer application habits and to promote the usage and benefits of chemical fertilizers to farmers. Fertilizer supply points have been added in various places, and the method of delivering fertilizer to the countryside has been implemented to facilitate farmers' purchases.

    广东供应农民大批化学肥料
    广东省各地供销合作社为支持农民早稻的中耕追肥，补救秧苗因春旱所遭受的损失，自五月中旬以来，把库存的约八万吨硫酸铵、硝酸铵钙等化学肥料，大力供应给农民使用。有些地区经追施这批化学肥料后，原来因春旱影响而枯黄的稻苗都已转青，促进了稻苗的发育成长。
    各地供销合作社为组织这批化学肥料的供应工作，抽调了大批干部下乡，了解农民用肥习惯，和向农民宣传化学肥料的用法和好处。各地都增设了肥料供应点，并且实行送肥下乡的办法，以方便农民购买。　　（本报驻广州记者）
