    Sino-Vietnamese People Embrace Each Other
    —Welcoming the Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
  　By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
    At the entrance of the airport, two bright red flags fluttered.
    One sparkled with five stars, and the other sparkled with a golden star; radiating dazzling light in the fiery June sky.
    On the airfield, where rows of silver and green airplanes were parked, appeared an unusual circle of colorful garlands.
    This was composed of girls' colorful dresses, children's red scarves and flowers, and formed by more than 10,000 people from Beijing welcoming the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    More than ten thousand hearts were eagerly waiting, and more than ten thousand pairs of eyes were fixed on the horizon.
    In the direction of the airport entrance, Chairman Mao and his close comrades-in-arms, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai, suddenly appeared.
    Applause rolled across the airport like thunder. More than ten thousand pairs of eyes were fixed on them.
    Chairman Mao smiled and looked at his watch from time to time. He put his hands behind his back and gazed into the distance. He was waiting with more than ten thousand people.
    The sound of the engine in the sky grew from far to near, and the green plane could be seen clearly. The two red flags with five stars and a golden star on it were also visible.
    The plane taxied down the runway. The government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by President Ho Chi Minh, arrived in Beijing.
    Chairman Mao walked quickly towards the plane. President Ho appeared at the cabin door. A wave of cheers swept through the airport: "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!"
    People were excited, jumping, and watching them intently.
    President Ho got off the plane. They quickly approached each other, and President Ho and Chairman Mao embraced tightly.
    This was an embrace between two ancient yet young countries; an embrace of the entire people of two countries who share a common destiny and have struggled together on a common path!
    President Ho then embraced Vice Chairman Zhu, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Lin Boqu. The people's free and happy laughter surrounded them.
    A middle-aged man with a bright smile walked towards Chairman Mao.
    "Comrade Truong Chinh," Chairman Mao greeted him warmly, shaking his hand tightly, and then warmly greeted the other comrades of the delegation.
    President Ho Chi Minh walked to the middle of the airport. A khaki uniform, gray hair, a ruddy face, and under a broad forehead, a pair of extraordinarily bright eyes sparkled with wisdom, as well as kindness and firmness. He smiled at the crowd and waved to the crowd with Chairman Mao. He seemed so familiar, so close to us.
    The solemn national anthems of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China were played.
    In the magnificent and loud music, people could not help but think of the difficult past of these two young republics—small armed forces resisting enemies dozens, hundreds of times their size, guerrillas in the dense forests, encirclement and suppression and counter-encirclement and suppression... The two young republics finally defeated the enemy step by step.
    Now, a solemn state honor guard was lined up on the airport. President Ho and Chairman Mao smiled. They reviewed the honor guard together.
    Two Young Pioneers ran to President Ho.
    "Hello, Uncle Ho!" The children innocently presented bouquets of flowers. President Ho kissed them affectionately.
    President Ho and Chairman Mao walked towards the welcoming crowd. A female student in a floral dress ran out excitedly and embraced President Ho.
    Flowers, flowers, countless bouquets of flowers, were presented to President Ho, cheers, cheers, waves of cheers surged towards President Ho. A Uyghur girl, Halima, and a Miao girl, Luo A'ni, ran to President Ho's side. President Ho hugged them, and said to them kindly in Chinese, like to his own children: "Go to Chairman Mao's place." The young people quickly ran to Chairman Mao's side. They said with a smile: "President Ho, Chairman Mao, are the great leaders of our two peoples, the fathers of our two peoples!"
    "Ho Chi Minh, muôn năm (Long live)!" "Chairman Mao, muôn năm!" A burst of cheers came from the ranks of Vietnamese students, members of the Vietnamese art troupe, and Vietnamese expatriates standing in the ranks. A Vietnamese mother named Nguyen Khoa Dieu Hong said with emotion: "Today, President Ho Chi Minh came to Beijing from Vietnam, he brought with him the deep friendship of all the Vietnamese people towards the Chinese people."
    Today, we also dedicate the sincere friendship of the Chinese people to President Ho, so that he can bring it to the Vietnamese people.

    中越人民拥抱在一起
    ——欢迎越南民主共和国政府代表团
  　本报记者　金凤
    飞机场的入口处，飘扬着两面鲜艳的红旗。
    一面闪耀着五星，一面闪耀着金星；在火也似的六月的天空发出灼灼的光芒。
    在停歇着一排排银色和绿色飞机的机场上，出现了一圈不平常的五彩的花环。
    这是由姑娘们彩色缤纷的衣裙和孩子们的红领巾和鲜花组成的，由北京市一万多欢迎越南民主共和国政府代表团的人们组成的。
    一万多颗心在急切地等待着，一万多双眼睛在凝望着天边。
    在向机场进口的方向，突然出现了毛主席和他的亲密战友朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长和周恩来总理。
    掌声像一阵阵的轻雷滚过机场。一万多双眼睛紧盯着他们。
    毛主席微笑着，时时看着手表。他背起双手，遥望着远方。他和一万多人一起在等待着。
    天空中的马达声由远而近，绿色的飞机看得清楚了，那上面的两面闪耀着五星和金星的红旗也看见了。
    飞机顺着跑道滑下来。胡志明主席率领的越南民主共和国政府代表团来到了北京。
    毛主席用很快的步伐走近飞机。胡主席在机舱门口出现了。机场上卷起一阵阵欢呼的波涛：“胡志明主席万岁！”
    人们激动着，跳跃着，目不转睛地看着他们。
    胡主席下了飞机。他们很快地走近了，胡主席同毛主席紧紧地拥抱在一起。
    这是两个古老而又年轻的国家的拥抱；是两国有着共同命运，在共同道路上斗争过来的全体人民的拥抱！
    胡主席接着拥抱了朱副主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理、董必武院长和林伯渠副委员长。人民的自由而幸福的欢笑围绕着他们。
    一位有着开朗的微笑的中年人走向毛主席。
    “长征同志”，毛主席亲切地招呼着，紧紧地握了手，接着又亲切地招呼代表团的其他同志。
    胡志明主席走到机场中间。淡黄色卡叽布的制服，灰白的头发，红润的脸，广阔的前额下，一双异常明亮的眼睛闪耀着智慧的光芒，也闪耀着慈爱和坚定，他向人群微笑着，和毛主席一起向人群招着手。他对我们显得那么熟悉，那么亲近。
    庄严的越南民主共和国国歌和中华人民共和国国歌奏起来了。
    在宏壮嘹亮的音乐声中，人们不禁想起了这两个年轻共和国的艰难的过去——微小的武装抗击着几十倍、几百倍的敌人，密林中的游击、围剿和反围剿……年轻的两个共和国终于一步步战胜了敌人。
    现在，飞机场上排列着庄严的国家仪仗队。胡主席和毛主席微笑着。他们一起检阅了仪仗队。
    两个少年先锋队员跑到胡主席面前。
    “胡伯伯好！”孩子们天真地献上满捧的鲜花。胡主席慈祥地亲吻着他们。
    胡主席和毛主席走向欢迎的人群。一个穿着花裙子的女学生兴奋地飞跑出来，拥抱着胡主席。
    鲜花，鲜花，数不尽的花捧，一簇簇献给胡主席，欢呼，欢呼，浪涛般的欢呼湧向胡主席。一位维吾尔族的姑娘哈利玛和一位苗族的姑娘罗阿妮飞跑到胡主席身边去，胡主席拥抱着她们，像对自己孩子般慈祥地用中国话对她们说：“到毛主席那里去”，年轻人赶紧跑到毛主席身边。她们笑着说：“胡主席，毛主席，是我们两国人民伟大的领袖，是我们两国人民的父亲！”
    “胡主席，莫南（万岁）！”“毛主席，莫南！”一阵阵欢呼从行列中站着的越南留学生、越南文工团员和越南侨民的队伍中传过来。一位名叫阮科耀红的越南母亲感动地说：“今天胡志明主席从越南来到北京，他把全越南人民对中国人民的深厚友谊都带来了。”
    今天，我们也把中国人民的亲切友情献给胡主席，让他带给越南人民。
