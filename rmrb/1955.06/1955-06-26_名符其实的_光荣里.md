A "Glorious Neighborhood" That Lives Up to Its Name
To the Editor:
	In the north of Yangliuqing Town, Hebei Province, there is a new area of housing, built last year by the state for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel who were in need of housing. Now, fourteen families of glorious revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary military personnel, and demobilized soldiers live in this new housing area. People affectionately gave this new housing area a name: "Glorious Neighborhood."
	Last year, this area suffered from flooding, and grain income decreased. The families of the martyrs and military personnel actively responded to the call of the Party and the government and participated in the production and self-salvation movement. Demobilized soldier Wei Fushun voluntarily took out 160 yuan of his production subsidy to help the families of martyrs and military personnel buy three straw rope machines. The supply and marketing cooperative also helped the families of martyrs and military personnel transport rice straw and helped solve the problem of straw rope sales. Chu Zhenhai, a 62-year-old family member of a military personnel, and his 17-year-old son made more than 270 kilograms of straw rope a day, earning an average of 1.5 yuan per day, thus overcoming the disaster.
	This spring, eleven families of martyrs and military personnel in "Glorious Neighborhood" joined the democratic agricultural producers' cooperative. Hu Wanliang, a family member of a military personnel, said, "Chairman Mao called on us to take the socialist road. It's definitely right. Only by joining agricultural producers' cooperatives can we increase production more and reach socialism faster." The members of this cooperative also welcomed the families of martyrs and military personnel to join. Many members said: The families of martyrs and military personnel sent their beloved sons and husbands into the army, liberated all of China, and defended the peace of the motherland and our happy lives. Their participation in the cooperative is an honor for our entire cooperative. Therefore, the members of the cooperative take special care of the production and life of the families of martyrs and military personnel. For the elderly family members of martyrs and military personnel, only light work that they can do is assigned. When Chu Zhenhai, a family member of a military personnel, was ill, the cooperative sent him rice, flour, and money, asking him to rest and recuperate and not to worry about the work in the fields.
	Under the care and help of the members, the families of martyrs and military personnel have further increased their labor enthusiasm. Hu Wanliang, a 62-year-old family member of a military personnel, is responsible for raising all the livestock in the cooperative. In addition to carrying water, feeding, cleaning the livestock sheds, and preparing feed during the day, he also has to get up four times every night to feed the livestock. Someone asked him, "Uncle Hu, aren't you tired from working day and night at such an old age?" He said, "We can't do heavy work in the fields, but we have to feed the livestock well so that they are strong and can guarantee increased production!" The six livestock he feeds are now growing very strong. The elderly women of the families of military personnel also participate in light agricultural labor and sideline production.
	I think that the labor enthusiasm of the families of martyrs and military personnel in Glorious Neighborhood is worth learning from in all regions.

### 名符其实的“光荣里”

    名符其实的“光荣里”编辑同志：
    在河北省杨柳青镇的北面有一片新房，这是去年国家为当地缺房住的烈属军属们盖的。现在在这片新房里，住着十四家光荣的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和复员军人。人们亲切地给这片新房起了个名字，叫“光荣里”。
    去年这地区闹了水灾，粮食收入减少，烈属军属积极响应了党和政府的号召，参加了生产自救运动。复员军人魏福顺，自动把生产资助金拿出一百六十元，帮助烈属军属买了三部草绳机；供销社也替烈属军属们调运了稻草，并帮助解决了草绳销路问题。六十二岁的军属褚振海和他的十七岁的儿子，一天打草绳二百七十多斤，平均每天收入一元五角，这样，他们战胜了灾荒。
    今年开春，“光荣里”有十一户烈属军属参加了民主农业生产合作社。军属胡万良说：“毛主席号召我们走社会主义的道路，保准没错，只有参加农业生产合作社，才能更多地增产，更快地到达社会主义。”这个社的社员，也都很欢迎烈属军属入社。许多社员说：烈属军属把自己亲爱的儿女和丈夫送入了部队，解放了全中国，保卫着祖国的和平和我们的幸福生活；他们参加到社里来，是我们全社的光荣。因此，社员们对烈属军属的生产和生活特别照顾。对于年岁大的烈属军属只分配做些能做的轻活。军属褚振海病了，社里给他送去米面和钱，要他安心养病，不要挂念地里的活计。
    烈属军属在社员们的照顾和帮助下更加提高了劳动热情。六十二岁的军属胡万良，负责饲养全社的牲口，除去白天要担水、喂料、打扫牲口棚、准备饲料以外，每天夜里还要定时起来喂四次牲口。有人问他：“胡大爷，这么大年岁，黑价白天干活不累么？”他说：“咱不能干地里的重活计，喂牲口可得喂得壮壮的，好保证增产啊！”经他喂的六头牲口，现在长得都很壮实。军属老大娘们也都参加了轻微的农业劳动和副业生产。
    我觉得光荣里的烈属军属的劳动热情值得各地学习。      照庚
