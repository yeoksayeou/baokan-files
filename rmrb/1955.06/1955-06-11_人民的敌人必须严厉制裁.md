    The People's Enemy Must Be Severely Punished
    Liu Baiyu
    Hu Feng, the true face of this mortal enemy of the Chinese people, has been completely and thoroughly exposed.
    After the first and second batches of exposure materials were published, people felt truly "astonished!" "Appalled!" People understood what a dark corner existed beneath Hu Feng's revolutionary facade, and how many counter-revolutionary and anti-people sinister plots were carried out from this dark corner. People expressed intolerable excitement and indignation. However, some people might still think that even though the counter-revolution was counter-revolutionary, it was only a counter-revolution in the cultural sphere, right? Now, the third batch of exposure materials has been published. This is the accusation, this is the ironclad proof, and it tells us that Hu Feng's sinister clique has always been a loyal running dog of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, a bandit engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. What "left-wing writer," what "realist theorist," what "if it weren't for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I personally wouldn't have found a place to settle down in the past twenty years," this is the most despicable deception, the most shameless lie. When the American-Chiang bandit gang launched a frenzied attack on the Chinese people, wasn't the sincere desire of the Hu Feng clique revealed so involuntarily? They fantasized that the Chinese People's Liberation Army "main force" "could be defeated in three months" and "cleared out in a year," and revealed a gnashing of teeth, saying that the attack on the people's revolutionary forces must "go all the way," and must be resolute and thorough. A Long looked delighted and hurriedly reported to Hu Feng: "Let me tell you to be optimistic." This vividly illustrates how eager the head of the Hu Feng sinister clique was for this kind of "optimism" at that time. I ask you, who would be like this during the days when the Chinese people were suffering? What kind of person would be like this? In the face of this ironclad evidence, Hu Feng! And the members of the Hu Feng sinister clique! Can you not lower your heads? Yes, all comrades and friends who fought alongside the Chinese people at that time should remember how American bullets killed our brothers and sisters. We are advancing, but we can never forget such deep hatred. It turns out that when our brothers and sisters fell, Hu Feng and A Long were so "optimistic." What is Hu Feng's background? Who is Hu Feng's master? Isn't this crystal clear? Now, let's take another look. After we overcame the difficulties, finally achieved victory, and won freedom and happiness, everything we have is so vigorous and thriving. We must strive forward without stopping, and we must create an even better socialist society. I ask you, at this time, who is slandering us as having "not a single clean piece of land" and being "distressed"? Who is cursing the people's new society and new regime as "withered leaves falling one after another" and "decaying"? Who is hatefully spreading the word: "The grave is being dug deeper and deeper, and the platform is being built higher and higher; then, if one side is a deep grave and the other side is a high platform, when you fall, you'll be finished." What kind of people are placing their hopes on the collapse of the people's new society and new regime? In the face of this ironclad evidence, Hu Feng! And the members of the Hu Feng sinister clique! Can you not lower your heads?
    When we uncover this dirty and ugly soul, I think it is not enough to be merely angry. At the same time, we should be more vigilant. We should also have a clearer understanding of how we should defend our new society and new regime, and how we should fight the enemy.
    As long as we take a look, why is our country so brilliant like the morning sun? Why are countless new records and new miracles being constantly created and emerging? I think every person in New China can answer this question. These miracles can only be created under the leadership of our Party and government, and by the courageous advancement of our hardworking people, drop by drop of sweat. When we fight against the counter-revolutionary clique, we cannot but think of the responsibility we bear. Because this is not a simple issue in the literary and art world, but the demands and aspirations of the people of the whole country. We know how intensely our worker brothers are fighting to produce one more furnace of iron and one more furnace of steel for the country. We know why work is so enthusiastically done on construction sites, even at night. We know how much hard work farmers have to put in to increase the country's grain production by one ton, one hundred tons. We know that the soldiers on the coastal defense front are risking their lives at all times to protect the security of the motherland. Think about it, can these people who are loyal to the motherland tolerate it when they see the Hu Feng clique's sinister activities to undermine the motherland? Can they not be angry? Can they not resolutely demand the complete smashing of the enemy's conspiracy?
    The enemy—all the vicious conspiracies and tricks—aim to destroy the new society we are building, to undermine the free and happy life we have already obtained, to allow the cannibalistic and wicked old forces to restore themselves, and to put the sinful shackles back on our shoulders. We know that this is the "subversive activity" and "black activity" that American imperialism has been targeting us with all along. Since 1949, hasn't the human and material evidence of this activity been placed before us clearly and surely? We have seen the fragments of American planes painted black, we have seen the assassination pistols that kill without a sound, we have seen the confessions written by American spies themselves, we have announced solemn and just verdicts more than once to those who betray the motherland, and now we have completely exposed Hu Feng, this long-standing counter-revolutionary black gang that has been watching and carrying out sabotage activities. No matter how you disguise yourself and hide, no matter how cunning and treacherous you are, the new China of 600 million people is strong, and anyone who attempts to undermine it or shake it will only end up being smashed to pieces.
    Today, the anger of the entire Chinese people is the action of the entire Chinese people. We love our glorious history of struggle, our country, our people, our new society that we are building, and our beautiful future. We must smash the Hu Feng sinister clique's conspiratorial activities. The people's era must advance by leaps and bounds. We tell all counter-revolutionary elements that we must severely punish the mortal enemy!

    人民的敌人必须严厉制裁
    刘白羽
    胡风，这个中国人民的死敌的原形，已经彻底无遗地暴露出来了。
    在第一、二批揭露材料发表之后，人们觉得真是“令人惊讶！”“怵目惊心！”人们明了了，在胡风那革命假招牌下面，是一个多么阴暗的角落，从这阴暗角落里施展了多少反革命、反人民的恶毒的阴谋，人们对这表现了无法容忍的激动和愤慨。可是，有的人也许还以为，反革命虽然是反革命，也不过是一个文化方面的反革命吧？现在，第三批揭露材料发表了，这就是罪状，这就是铁证，它告诉了我们，胡风这个罪恶集团，从来就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，干着反革命勾当的匪徒。什么“左翼作家”，什么“现实主义理论家”，什么“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”，这是最卑鄙的骗局，最无耻的谎话。当美蒋匪帮向中国人民发动疯狂进攻时，胡风集团的真诚心愿，不就那样情不自禁地流露出来了吗？他们幻想把中国人民解放军“主力”“三个月可以击破”“一年肃清”，并露出咬牙切齿的声音，说什么进攻人民革命力量，要“一不做，二不休”，必须坚决彻底。阿垅那样喜形于色，赶紧报告胡风说：“也告诉你乐观一下”。这就活生生地说明，胡风这个罪恶集团的头子，那时，是多么急于需要这种“乐观”了。请问，在中国人民受灾难的日子，谁会这样？什么人会这样？在这铁证面前，胡风！和胡风罪恶集团分子！能不低下头吗？是的，凡是在那个时候和中国人民一起战斗过来的同志、朋友，都该记得，美国子弹是怎样杀死我们的兄弟姊妹们的，我们前进着，但，我们是永远不能忘记这样深刻的仇恨。原来，当我们兄弟姊妹倒下的时候，胡风和阿垅们是那样“乐观”，胡风的底子是什么？胡风的主子是谁，这还不明明白白吗？现在，再来看一看，当我们通过了艰难，终于取得了胜利，争取到自由和幸福，我们的一切是多么蓬蓬勃勃，欣欣向荣，我们要不停止地努力前进，我们要创造起一个更美好的社会主义社会。请问，在这时候，是谁污蔑我们“没有一块干净的土地”“苦闷”，是谁把人民的新社会，新政权，诅咒为“枯黄的叶子正纷纷下落”、“正在腐朽”，是谁仇恨地散播着：“坟是愈挖愈深的，台是愈搭愈高的；那末，如果一面是深坟而另一面是高台，跌下来时就呜呼完蛋了。”是什么人把希望寄托在人民的新社会、新政权的倒台？在这铁证面前，胡风！还有胡风罪恶集团分子们！能不低下头吗？
    当我们揭开这肮脏、丑恶的灵魂的时候，我想仅仅愤怒是不够的，同时，我们应该更加警醒起来。我们也应该更清楚地认识到：我们应该怎样保卫我们的新社会、新政权，应该怎样同敌人战斗。
    只要我们展眼看一看，在我们的国家里，为什么能这样像早晨的太阳一样光辉灿烂，为什么能这样不断地创造着、涌现着无数新的纪录，新的奇迹。我想每一个新中国的人民，都能回答这个问题。这些奇迹，只有在我们的党和政府领导下，在我们勤劳的人民，一滴汗，一滴汗地奋勇前进下，才能创造出来的。当我们和反革命集团作斗争的时候，我们不能不想到我们所负的责任。因为这不是一个简单的文艺界的问题，而是全国人民的要求和愿望。我们知道，工人兄弟多么紧张地，为了国家多产一炉铁、一炉钢而战斗着；我们知道，在工地上，为什么黑夜也像白天一样热烈地劳动；我们知道，为了国家增产一吨，一百吨粮食，农民要付出多少辛苦；我们知道，在海防前线上的战士，为了保护祖国的安全，无时无刻不在拿自己的生命战斗。想一想，这些忠诚于祖国的人们，当他们看到胡风集团这样破坏祖国的阴谋活动时，他们能够容忍吗？他们能不愤怒吗？他们能不坚决地要求彻底粉碎敌人的阴谋吗？
    敌人——一切恶毒的阴谋诡计，其目的就是毁灭我们正在建设的新社会，破坏我们已经获得的自由、幸福的生活，就是让那吃人的万恶旧势力复辟，让那罪恶的枷锁再加在我们肩头。我们知道，这就是美帝国主义一直在针对着我们进行的“颠覆活动”
  “黑色活动”。从一九四九年以来，这种活动的人证物证，不都确确实实地摆在我们面前了吗？我们看到涂成黑色的美国飞机碎片，我们看到杀人不闻声的暗杀手枪，我们看到美国特务亲笔写下的供状，我们对背叛祖国的，不只一次宣布了庄严的、正义的判词，现在，我们彻底揭穿了胡风这种长期以来，一直在窥伺着，进行着破坏活动的反革命黑帮。不管你怎样伪装暗藏，不管你怎样刁诈险恶，六亿人民的新中国是坚强的，谁企图来破坏它、动摇它，其结果，是只有跌得稀烂，碰得粉碎的。
    今天，全中国人民的愤怒，就是全中国人民的行动。我们热爱我们的光荣的斗争历史、我们的国家、我们的人民、我们正在建设的新社会和美好的未来，我们就一定要粉碎胡风罪恶集团的阴谋活动。人民的时代，一定要大踏步前进，我们告诉一切反革命分子，对于死敌——我们必须严厉制裁！
