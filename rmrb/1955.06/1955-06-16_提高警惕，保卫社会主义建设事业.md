    Heighten Vigilance, Defend the Socialist Construction Cause
    Meng Tai
    After reading the "People's Daily" publication of the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I was simply filled with indignation. It turns out that Hu Feng and his cronies, who constantly proclaimed their "support" for the revolution, are actually a group of the most vicious counter-revolutionaries who kill without shedding blood. Their hatred for the Party, the people, and the revolution has reached such a degree! They dream of the "demise" and "end" of the people's revolutionary regime, and they describe the people's revolutionary forces as "pus," believing that it "must be expelled." In reality, they are lackeys of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandits. Their goal is to sabotage our socialist construction cause, attempt to subvert the people's revolutionary regime, and try to turn our country back into an imperialist colony, forcing us to live a painful and miserable life again. We will not allow any of this. I demand that Hu Feng and the core members of his clique be punished immediately according to the law.
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident is an extremely serious one. The exposure of this incident fully demonstrates that we, the awakened Chinese people, are united as one, and no matter how cleverly the counter-revolutionaries conceal themselves, their fox tails will always be exposed. At the same time, the exposure of this incident is also a major victory for our country's socialist construction cause. But we must also learn a lesson from this incident, especially in Anshan, our country's first iron and steel industrial base. The enemy will never relax their efforts, and they will definitely try to sneak in and carry out sabotage. All of us workers and staff in Angang must heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, actively participate in the struggle to crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and expose and denounce all hidden counter-revolutionaries, not allowing their conspiracies to succeed, and protecting our great country even better and building it even better.

    提高警惕，保卫社会主义建设事业
    孟泰
    看了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，我简直气愤极了。原来口口声声“拥护”革命的胡风和他的喽啰们，却是一群杀人不见血的最凶恶的反革命分子。他们仇恨党仇恨人民仇恨革命，已经到了这样的程度！他们梦想人民革命政权的“灭亡”“完蛋”，他们把人民革命力量说成是“脓”，认为“总要排出”。实际上，他们就是蒋介石卖国贼的走狗。他们的目的就是要破坏我们的社会主义建设事业，企图颠覆人民革命政权，想把我们的国家再度变为帝国主义的殖民地，让我们再过痛苦悲惨的生活。这一切我们都是不允许的，我要求立即依法惩办胡风及其集团骨干分子。
    胡风反革命集团的事件是一件十分严重的事件。这一事件的揭露，充分说明了我们觉悟了的中国人民，是团结一致的，不管反革命分子隐瞒得多么巧妙，他们的狐狸尾巴总是藏不住的。同时这一事件的揭露，也是我国社会主义建设事业的一大胜利。但是我们也要从这一事件里吸取教训，特别是我们鞍山，是我国的第一个钢铁工业基地，敌人是决不会放松的，他们一定会想法钻进来进行破坏的。我们鞍钢全体职工一定要百倍地提高警惕，积极地参加粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争，检举和揭露一切暗藏的反革命分子，不让他们的阴谋活动得逞，把我们伟大的国家保卫得更好建设得更好。
