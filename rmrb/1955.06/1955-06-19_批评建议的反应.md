Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    A letter from the Supply Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company: The criticism of our department's stockpiled materials by a reader in the People's Daily on May 15th is correct. After inspection, we found that not only is there a large amount of stockpiled material, but there are also serious waste phenomena in the supply and storage of materials. The long-term existence of these problems is mainly due to the bureaucracy and blind complacency of the leadership of our department, which failed to discover and correct shortcomings in our work in a timely manner. We have recently decided to take effective measures to improve our work.

      After the People's Daily published a reader's letter on May 9th, "Liaoning Provincial Industrial Department Should Immediately Correct the Error of Staff Members Seeking Personal Gain at Public Expense," the Liaoning Provincial Industrial Department has replied in a letter and taken measures to actively urge employees to repay their debts.

    A letter from Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory: Regarding the issue of stockpiled yarn-wrapped wire in our factory (original criticism published on May 9th in the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily), we exposed it last July, but only issued an internal notice without actively dealing with the stockpiled materials. We are determined to change this situation in the future.

      A letter from Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory: The People's Daily's criticism on May 9th that our factory does not pay enough attention to sanitation is correct. We sincerely accept this criticism. After receiving the criticism, we have convened a meeting of responsible staff members of various relevant departments to conduct an inspection, and have formulated measures to improve and strengthen sanitation work.

      Regarding the criticism on the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page on May 22nd regarding the late issuance of the 1955 first quarter procurement plan of the China Native Produce Company Inner Mongolia Branch, and the plan's lack of realism, the Inner Mongolia Branch has convened relevant personnel for inspection, and clearly stipulated the responsibility system for formulating plans at this year's April trade conference. At the same time, it has also reviewed the bureaucratic and unserious attitude in the work of approving plans.

      On May 15th, the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page criticized the blind establishment of a chicken farm in Weijiazhuang, Linxian County, Henan Province. Now, the Linxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has sent a letter of self-criticism, admitting that the failure of the Weijiazhuang chicken farm was caused by blind advancement by the leadership. Currently, only eighty-two chickens remain, making it impossible to assign a dedicated person to raise them. After obtaining the consent of the masses, the County Committee decided to close the chicken farm.

    鞍山钢铁公司供应处来信：五月十五日人民日报读者对我处积压材料的批评是正确的。经过检查，我们发现不但积压的材料多，而且在材料的供应和保管方面也有严重浪费现象。这些问题的长期存在，主要是由于我处领导方面官僚主义和盲目自满，对工作中的缺点不能及时发现和纠正。最近我们已决定采取有效措施来改进工作。
