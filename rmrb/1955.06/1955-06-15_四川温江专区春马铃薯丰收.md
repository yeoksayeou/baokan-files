　　Sichuan Wenjiang Prefecture's more than 120,000 mu of spring potatoes have had a widespread bumper harvest, with a total output of more than 200 million jin, and the yield per unit area has increased by more than 20% compared with 1954.

　　The planting of spring potatoes was under the advocacy of the local Party committees, mobilizing farmers to tap production potential and utilize the period after harvesting milk vetch, broad beans, radishes, and other crops, and before transplanting rice, to increase the planting of a season of short-term crops. The bumper harvest of spring potatoes has greatly increased farmers' incomes. In 1954, the total output value of the rape and other minor spring crops of the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative in Hedeng Township, Xinfan County, was only more than 30,000 yuan. This year, the income from spring potatoes alone was 28,800 yuan. After the distribution of spring crops in the whole cooperative, the net income of the members increased by more than double compared with last year, encouraging everyone to more actively tap the potential of the land.

    四川温江专区春马铃薯丰收
    四川温江专区十二万多亩春马铃薯普遍丰收，总产量两亿多斤，单位面积产量比一九五四年增加两成多。
    种植春马铃薯是在各地党委倡导下，发动农民挖掘生产潜力，利用苕子、密胡豆、萝卜等收获后到水稻栽秧前，这一段时间增种的一季短期作物。春马铃薯的丰收大大增加农民的收入。新繁县禾登乡新民农业社一九五四年油菜等小春作物总产值才三万多元，今年春马铃薯一项收入就有两万八千八百元，全社小春作物分配后，社员纯收益比去年增加一倍多，鼓舞大家更加积极挖掘土地潜力。
