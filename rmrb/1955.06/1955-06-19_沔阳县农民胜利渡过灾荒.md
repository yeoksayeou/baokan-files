    Mianyang County Farmers Triumphantly Overcome Famine

    Farmers in Mianyang County, Hubei Province, which suffered severe flooding last year, have victoriously overcome the famine. According to statistics from June 4th, the harvest of 1.14 million mu of summer crops (barley has been completely harvested, and wheat is being harvested) is slightly higher than the average annual yield. All 830,000 mu of paddy fields in the county have been planted with seedlings, and the seedlings are growing well. The cotton planting area has also exceeded the planting plan.

    Currently, farmers are irrigating the paddy fields, harvesting wheat, and intensifying field management of cotton fields.

    沔阳县农民胜利渡过灾荒
    湖北省去年遭受严重水灾的沔阳县农民胜利渡过了灾荒。据六月四日统计，全县一百十四万亩夏收作物（大麦已收割完毕、小麦正在收割），收成稍高于常年产量。全县八十三万亩水稻田都插上了秧，秧苗成长良好。棉花播种面积也超额完成播种计划。
    现在，农民正在进行车水灌秧田，收割小麦，并加紧棉田田间管理。
