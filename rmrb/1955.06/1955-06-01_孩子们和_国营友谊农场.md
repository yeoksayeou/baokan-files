On May 25th, the third squad of the ninth middle school of the Young Pioneers of China in Beijing sent their third letter to the Northeast State-Run Friendship Farm.

Their friendship with the Friendship Farm began in January of this year. After learning about the construction of the State-Run Friendship Farm, all seventeen members discussed establishing contact with the Friendship Farm. During a squad day meeting, they discussed the content of the letter and decided to send a gift – various grain varieties from Beijing – to the Friendship Farm.

All the members began collecting seeds for the Friendship Farm. The school is located at the foot of the Cuiwei Mountain in the suburbs of Beijing, and many of the children's homes are in the countryside, seven or eight li away from the school. At that time, several snowflakes had already fallen. One Saturday afternoon, the children braved the cold and went home separately to find seeds. Fifteen-year-old member Wu Zhicheng returned home and picked out the largest and plumpest of each type of grain from his family's supplies, including mung beans, corn, peanuts, winter wheat, etc., and wrapped them up. He also went to a neighbor's house to find adzuki beans. The next day, he crossed the snow-covered Cuiwei Mountain again and went to his great-aunt's house to find green beans and other varieties.

Many seeds were found, everything you could want: corn, soybeans, buckwheat, and sesame. The children selected these seeds over and over again, and finally chose the large and plump corn, soybeans, peanuts, and other seven varieties. On January 8th, they sent a package containing these varieties and a letter to the "State-Run Friendship Farm." They said in the letter: "When we heard about the construction of the mechanized State-Run Friendship Farm, we were all very happy and decided to send you some seeds. Dear uncles, this is the sincere friendship and ardent wishes of all our members, hoping that the seeds from the capital can be sown on the distant northeast farm and, through your labor, bear the fruit of friendship."

The seeds and letters sent by the children greatly encouraged the farm builders who were far away from the capital of the motherland. The State-Run Friendship Farm has sown all the seeds sent by the children in the variety observation and testing area of the experimental station and named them "Young Pioneer."

The children deeply love the farm, and they have become increasingly close to each other. They wrote to the farm to request seeds of Northeast soybeans, spring wheat, tomatoes, and peppers. With the school's permission, they opened up a piece of wasteland on the campus for planting. They called this land the "Young Pioneer Friendship Farm" and elected a member as the farm manager. The children cherish these seeds sent from afar very much. After planting, they take turns on duty every day to manage the seedlings, watering and weeding them. They also made a very exquisite notebook, and the person on duty writes a daily diary about the farm work and the growth of the seedlings. Now the spring wheat and Northeast soybeans in the "farm" are growing very well, and the tomato and pepper seedlings are also about to be cultivated and can be transplanted soon. The children plan to report their labor achievements to the Northeast State-Run Friendship Farm after the "farm" has a bumper harvest.

    孩子们和“国营友谊农场”
    新华社记者　雷润明
    五月二十五日，中国少年先锋队北京市第九中学第三中队的队员们给东北国营友谊农场，寄去了第三封信。
    他们和友谊农场的友谊是在今年一月开始建立的。他们自从知道了国营友谊农场开始兴建的消息以后，全体十七个队员就商量着和友谊农场建立联系。在一次中队日的队会上，他们讨论了写信的内容，并决定送一份礼物——北京的各种粮食品种给友谊农场。
    全体队员开始了为友谊农场收集种子的活动。这个学校座落在北京城郊的翠巍山下，孩子们的家不少在远离学校七、八里路以外的农村。那时已经飘过几场雪花。在一个礼拜六的下午，孩子们冒着严寒分头回家找种子。十五岁的队员吴志诚回家后，把家里的粮食每样捡了一份颗粒最大，最丰满的包了起来，其中有绿豆、玉米、花生、冬小麦等，他还到邻家找来了小豆。第二天，他又翻过了积雪覆盖着的翠巍山，跑到他姑奶奶家里找来了青豆等品种。
    种子找到了很多，真是应有尽有，有玉米、有大豆，也有荞麦和芝麻，孩子们把这些种子选了又选，最后选出了颗粒大而丰满的玉米、黄豆和花生等七种品种。一月八日他们把一个装着这些品种的邮包和一封信寄往“国营友谊农场”。他们在信中说：“我们听到祖国建设机械化国营友谊农场的时候，我们都很高兴。决定寄给你们一些种子。亲爱的叔叔们，这是我们全体队员的真挚友谊，炽热的愿望，希望首都的种子能播种在遥远的东北农场上，在你们的劳动下，结出友谊的果实。”
    孩子们寄去的种子和信，给远离祖国首都的农场建设者以极大的鼓舞。国营友谊农场已把孩子们寄去的种子，全部播种在试验站品种观察试验区里，并定名为“红领巾号”。
    孩子们深深的爱上了农场，他们彼此之间也越来越亲密了。他们给农场写信要来了东北大豆、春小麦、西红柿和辣椒等种子，经学校的许可在校园内开辟了一块荒地进行了播种，他们把这块土地叫做“红领巾友谊农场”，并选出了一个队员作场长。孩子们非常珍贵这些从远地寄来的种子，播种后他们每天轮流值日管理，给幼苗浇水、锄草。他们还弄了一个很精致的本子，每天由值日写农场工作和幼苗生长情况的日记。现在“农场”里的春小麦、东北大豆长的很好，西红柿、辣椒的幼苗也快培植好了，不久就可移种。孩子们计划“农场”丰收后，再向东北国营友谊农场，汇报他们劳动的成绩。
