Factories in Various Locations Trial-Produce Cooperative Products for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant

Thirty-four factories across the country are trial-producing cooperative products for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

While the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is carrying out production preparation work, thirty-four factories in Changchun, Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shenyang, Harbin, Mudanjiang, and other places are working intensely on trial-producing various cooperative products for the First Automobile Plant. Manufacturing a car requires more than 3,500 types of parts, of which approximately 2,000 types need to be produced in cooperation with fifteen industrial sectors, including rubber, ball bearings, asbestos, papermaking, cotton textiles, glass, and electrical industries. By late May, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant had signed trial production contracts with relevant units for 105 products, including rubber and paper materials, as well as supply contracts for more than 130 products, including generators, spring washers, steering wheels, and oilcloth.

The generators produced by the Boshan Electric Motor Factory used to be assembled in various imported automobiles. When the factory workers heard that they were going to manufacture generators for the First Automobile Plant, they all happily said: This time we must produce better quality generators to be assembled in cars made by ourselves.

The various factories that have signed supply contracts for cooperative products will start supplying the first batch of cooperative products to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant from September this year. (Our newspaper's collective correspondent, Jilin Daily Editorial Department)

Emei Mountain West Wing to Build Hydropower Station

A medium-sized hydropower station—Longchi Hydropower Station—will be built in the towering mountains of the west wing of Emei Mountain in Sichuan Province. It will be a cascade-style, multi-stage power station built utilizing the waterfall power of the Emei Mountain peaks. In late May, the drilling team officially began drilling work from Wanping to Shipan. The hydrographic survey team is working with hydrological stations in Longchi, Guanyintan, and other places to collect detailed hydrological data.

After the Longchi Hydropower Station is completed in 1957, it will generate 2,000 kilowatts. It will form a power grid with the Minjiang Power Plant, supplying industrial electricity to the Emei Phosphate Mine, refractory material factories, and other plants and mines, as well as lighting electricity for residents, through the general distribution station.

North China Metal Structure Factory Building Completed

The factory building project of the North China Metal Structure Factory was completed at the end of May. Preliminary acceptance has proved that the project quality basically meets the design requirements. Currently, installation workers are installing gantry planers, 150-ton slotting machines, 100-horsepower air compressors, and crane beams, and other machinery and equipment inside the factory building. All installation work can be completed before the end of July. As of June 4th, 85% of the machinery and equipment ordered from more than 50 factories and enterprises across the country, including Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, Dalian Crane Factory, Nanjing Machine Tool Factory, Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory, and Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory, had been transported to the factory, and the rest are on their way to Beijing.

Production preparation work for the North China Metal Structure Factory has also been underway for some time. The training of more than 900 riveters, welders, blacksmiths, machinists, fitters, electricians, and cadres has been completed, and they have begun to participate in installation and production preparation work. Product quality requirements and operating procedures have been established. (Xinhua News Agency)

Huainan Coal Mine Reconstructing Four Production Mines

The Huainan Coal Mine is reconstructing its existing four production mines. After all the reconstruction projects are completed, the annual output of the Huainan Coal Mine will increase by 26% compared to the output in 1954 before the reconstruction. Currently, some projects at the Caijiagang and Xinzhuangzi mines, which started earlier among the four mines, have been put into production. The reconstruction projects at the Jiulonggang and Datong mines will start successively in the second half of this year or next year.

These reconstruction projects are being carried out according to the characteristics of each mine. Jiulonggang and Datong mines are old mines with a long history of mining. After the reconstruction of these two mines, the mining life of Jiulonggang mine alone can be extended by twenty-five to thirty years. The original equipment of Xinzhuangzi and Caijiagang mines was relatively simple, and some designs did not meet the requirements for coal mine development. Some transportation work above and below ground still relied on manual labor. After the reconstruction, the degree of mechanization of these two mines will be further improved. Among them, the labor productivity of each production worker in Caijiagang mine can be doubled compared to this year, and the cost per ton of coal will also be reduced by about two yuan compared to this year.

Rush to Build Flood Control Projects on the Jining-Erlian Railway

Workers on the Jining-Erlian Railway are rushing to build many flood control projects. Major projects such as the diversion of the Dawang River and the construction of guide dikes have all started. Thirty-four flood control dams, stone revetments, widened protective roads, and reservoirs along the railway line have also started construction, except for a few individual projects. All flood control projects are expected to be completed by the end of June. At that time, the Jining-Erlian Railway will not be threatened by floods. (Xinhua News Agency)

Seven More Projects Start in Lanzhou

In May, seven new construction and expansion projects started in Lanzhou. These include dormitories and office buildings for large enterprises such as the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant and the Lanzhou Refinery. Before construction, all temporary projects such as cement warehouses, hardware warehouses, water supply projects, power supply projects, workshops, employee canteens, and dormitories were prepared.

In order to accelerate the construction of various major projects, the Northwest Lanzhou Engineering Corporation is actively preparing to establish a concrete prefabrication plant, two new timber processing plants, and an iron parts repair shop to promote advanced industrialized and mechanized construction methods. The timber processing plant has changed from a single shift system to a day and night two-shift system. The Gu Longquan team, which is responsible for excavating foundation trenches, could only excavate five cubic meters per day at the beginning, but now it has increased to excavating more than ten cubic meters.

Yunnan Province Completes Three Reservoirs

Luliang County in the upper reaches of the Nanpan River in Yunnan Province, Yao'an County in the Jinsha River basin, and Kunyang County near Dianchi Lake have completed the Maizi River, Yangpai Peng, and Shuanglongba reservoirs. The total water storage capacity of these three reservoirs reaches 106 million cubic meters, which can irrigate more than 120,000 mu of rice fields, convert more than 60,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, and prevent floods during the rainy season. The Yangpai Peng reservoir in Yao'an County alone can ensure that 60,000 mu of rice are protected from flood disasters. (Xinhua News Agency)

Bayantala Farm Plants Crops on Newly Reclaimed Land

The largest state-owned farm in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region—Bayantala Mechanical Farm—has planted crops on more than 5,500 mu of newly reclaimed land this year. Currently, soybean, corn, and sorghum seedlings are growing vigorously, and cultivators have begun to weed in the fields.

The farm's orchard has planted pear, peach, apple, and grape seedlings, and the vegetable garden is a green expanse. Fish fry will be released into a natural lake on the edge of the farm. In addition, hundreds of improved breeds of cattle and sheep will soon be transported to the livestock farm here.

A year ago, this place, which the Mongols called "Bayantala" (meaning rich plain), was still a wilderness where wild sheep roamed and reeds grew. Reclamation workers drove tractors to reclaim the wasteland and turn it into fertile land. This farm will continue to reclaim wasteland this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station Receives Support from Various Places

The experimental work carried out by the Lhasa "July 1st" Agricultural Experiment Station on the plateau has received support from agricultural departments and people in various places. The experiment station regularly receives guidance and assistance from central agricultural leadership organs and research departments. Many agricultural research and experimental institutions in North China, Northwest China, Southwest China, and Central South China continuously send them seeds and technical documents. The winter wheat vernalization treatment summary sent by the North China Academy of Agricultural Sciences helped the experiment station to conduct this experiment this year. Half a month ago, citrus, pomelo, and other subtropical fruit tree seeds were sown for the first time in the experiment station's nursery. These seeds were sent by the Meixian Farm in Guangdong Province and agricultural workers in Guangdong and Guangxi. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture sent them eight kinds of vegetable seeds from Albania, including spinach, onion, and lettuce, to be trialed on the plateau.

The experiment station also sends seeds of excellent varieties of highland barley and spring wheat from the Kangzang Plateau to various places. Last year, the experiment station also collected more than a dozen kinds of highland crop and vegetable seeds and sent them to Moscow. (Xinhua News Agency)

Changan County Promotes Double Cropping Experience of Rice and Wheat

Changan County in Shaanxi Province has successfully promoted the double cropping experience of rice and wheat. Farmers in this county sowed more than 20,000 mu of wheat in the fields where rice had been harvested last autumn. These wheat crops have now begun to be harvested, and it is estimated that each mu can yield more than 240 jin, which is more than double the yield of planting barley (or highland barley) once after the rice harvest in the past.

The Wangmang Village "July 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative was the first to try the double cropping experience of rice and wheat in Changan County. In 1952 and 1953, the cooperative's rice and wheat crops generally had bumper harvests, increasing the value of each mu of land by 32% annually compared to before the double cropping of rice and wheat. In 1954, the rice-growing areas of Changan County began to promote the double cropping experience of rice and wheat. This spring, the Changan County People's Committee organized more than 500 district and township cadres and key members of agricultural production cooperatives to visit Wangmang Village. The entire rice-growing area has more than 50,000 mu of rice, and the planting of wheat will continue to be promoted after the autumn harvest this year.

There are also more than 2 million mu of paddy fields at the foot of the Qinling Mountains, which have the same natural conditions as Changan County. The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture is preparing to gradually promote the double cropping experience of rice and wheat in this area. It is estimated that at least 200 million jin of wheat can be increased annually for the country after full promotion. (Xinhua News Agency)

    各地工厂为第一汽车制造厂试制合作产品
    全国各地三十四个工厂为第一汽车制造厂试制合作产品。
    在第一汽车制造厂进行生产准备工作的同时，长春、上海、天津、青岛、沈阳、哈尔滨、牡丹江等地的三十四个工厂，正在为第一汽车厂紧张地试制各种合作产品。制造一辆汽车需要用三千五百多种零件，其中约有两千多种零件需要由橡胶、滚珠轴承、石棉、造纸、棉纺织、玻璃、电气等十五种工业部门合作生产。到五月下旬，第一汽车制造厂已经同有关单位签订了合作生产橡胶、纸料等一百零五种产品的试制合同，以及生产发电机、弹簧垫圈、方向盘、漆布等一百三十多种产品的供应合同。
    博山电机制造厂生产的发电机，过去都是给进口的各种汽车装配的。这个厂职工听说要给第一汽车厂制造发电机，都高兴地说：这回我们一定要生产质量更好的发电机，装配在自己制造的汽车上。
    已经签订供应合同的各生产合作产品工厂，将从今年九月份开始供应第一批合作产品给第一汽车制造厂。（本报集体通讯员吉林日报编辑部）
    峨嵋山西翼将修建水电站
    四川省峨嵋山西翼的崇山峻岭中将修建一座中型的水力发电站——龙池水力发电站。它将是利用峨嵋山群峰的瀑布水力修建的阶梯式的多级发电站。五月下旬，钻探队正式开始钻探万坪到石盘的工程。水力勘测队正会同龙池、观音滩等地的水文站详细收集水文资料。
    龙池水力发电站一九五七年完工以后，将发电两千瓩。它将和岷江电厂构成一个输电网，通过总的配电所供应峨嵋磷矿、耐火材料厂等厂矿的工业用电和居民的照明用电。        （本报驻成都记者）
    华北金属结构工厂厂房盖好
    华北金属结构工厂厂房工程，已在五月底完工。经过初步验收证明，工程质量基本上符合设计要求。现在，安装工人们正在厂房内安装龙门刨床、一百五十吨的牛头冲床、一百马力的空气压缩机和吊车梁等机器设备，七月底以前可以完成全部安装工作。到六月四日止，向沈阳重型机器厂、大连起重机器厂、南京机床厂、上海电焊机厂、湘潭电机厂等全国各地五十多个工厂企业订购的机器设备，已有百分之八十五运到厂内，其余正在运京途中。
    华北金属结构工厂的生产准备工作也早在进行。九百多个铆、焊、锻、机、钳、电工和干部的训练工作已经结束，他们开始参加安装和生产准备工作。产品的质量要求和操作规程已经订出。 （新华社）
    淮南煤矿改建四个生产矿井
    淮南煤矿改建现有的四个生产矿井。改建工程全部完工后，淮南煤矿的年产量将比改建前一九五四年的产量增加百分之二十六。现在，这四个矿中动工较早的蔡家岗和新庄孜两矿的部分工程已经投入生产，九龙岗、大通矿的改建工程，将在今年下半年或明年陆续开工。
    这些改建工程都是根据各矿的特点进行的。九龙岗、大通两矿都是开采年代很久的老矿井，这两矿改建以后，仅九龙岗矿的开采年限就可延长二十五年到三十年。新庄孜、蔡家岗两矿原有设备比较简陋，有些地方的设计不合乎煤矿发展的要求，井上井下部分运输工作还用人力。改建后，这两矿的机械化程度将进一步提高。其中蔡家岗矿每个生产工人劳动生产率可比今年提高一倍，每吨煤的成本也将比今年降低两元左右。（新华社）
  集二线赶筑防洪工程
    集二线上，工人们正在赶筑许多防洪工程。较大的坝王河改河和导流堤等工程，已经全部动工。沿线三十四处防洪坝、砌石护坡、加宽护道和蓄水池等工程，除个别工程外，也已陆续动工。全部防洪工程预计在六月底结束。那时，集二线就可以不受洪水的威胁。（新华社）
    兰州又有七项工程开工
    五月份，兰州市又有新建和扩建的七项工程开工。其中包括兰州石油机械厂、兰州炼油厂等大企业的宿舍和办公室等建筑。在施工以前，各项暂设工程，如水泥库、五金库、给水工程、给电工程、工作棚、职工食堂、宿舍等都已准备妥当。
    为了加速各项大工程的施工，西北兰州工程总公司正积极筹设混凝土预制厂、两个新的木材加工厂和铁件修配厂，以推行先进的工厂化、机械化施工方法。木材加工厂，由原来的一班制改为日夜两班制。负责挖基槽的顾龙泉小组，开始时每天只能挖五方，现在提高到挖十几方。  （伍零）
    云南省建成三座水库
    云南省南盘江上流的陆良县、金沙江流域的姚安县和滇池旁的昆阳县，已建成麦子河、洋派淜和双龙坝三个水库。这三座水库蓄水总量达一亿零六百多万立方公尺，可灌溉十二万多亩稻田，并使六万多亩旱田改为水田，雨季内又可防止洪水泛滥。仅姚安县的洋派淜水库就可保证六万亩的水稻免除洪水灾害。  （新华社）
    巴音塔拉农场新垦地种庄稼
    内蒙古自治区最大的国营农场——巴音塔拉机械农场，今年已在新开垦的五千五百多亩土地上种上了庄稼。现在，大豆、玉米和高粱的禾苗生长茁壮，中耕机已开始到田间锄草。
    农场的果树园已栽种了梨、桃、苹果和葡萄的树苗，蔬菜场里一片绿色。农场边沿的一个天然湖里，将放养鱼苗。另外，还有几百头良种牛羊也快要运到这里的养畜场。
    一年前，这片被蒙古人称为“巴音塔拉”（意思是富饶的平原）的地方，还是野羊出没、长满芦苇的荒野。垦殖人员们驾驶着拖拉机垦荒，把荒野变成良田。今年这个农场还要继续开荒。  （新华社）
    拉萨农业试验场得到各地支持
    拉萨“七·一”农业试验场在高原上进行的试验工作，受到了各地农业部门和人民的支持。试验场经常得到中央农业领导机关和研究部门的指导和帮助，华北、西北、西南和中南地区的许多农业研究试验机关，不断给他们寄来种籽和技术文件。华北农业科学研究所寄来的冬麦春化处理总结，帮助试验场今年做这项试验。半个月前，试验场的苗圃里第一次播种了柑子、柚子等亚热带果树种籽，这些种籽是广东省梅县农场和在广东、广西的农业工作者寄来的。最近，农业部又给他们寄来了阿尔巴尼亚的菠菜、洋葱、莴苣等八种蔬菜种籽，让他们在高原上试种。
    试验场也把康藏高原上的优良品种的青稞、春麦等种籽寄给各地。去年，试验场还搜集了十几种高原作物和蔬菜的种籽寄往莫斯科。（新华社）
    长安县推广稻麦两熟经验
    陕西省长安县推广稻、麦两熟的经验获得成功。这个县的农民在去年秋季收割过水稻的地里播种了两万多亩小麦。现在这些小麦已开始收割，估计每亩可收二百四十多斤，比过去水稻收获后复种一次大麦（或青稞）的产量高出一倍以上。
    长安县首先试用稻、麦两熟经验的是王莽村“七一”农业生产合作社。一九五二年和一九五三年这个社稻、麦两作的土地普遍丰收，使每年每亩土地的产值比稻、麦两作前增加了百分之三十二。一九五四年长安县稻作区开始推广稻、麦两熟的经验。今年春季，长安县人民委员会又组织全县五百多名区、乡干部和农业生产合作社的骨干分子到王莽村参观。整个稻作区水稻面积达五万多亩，今年秋收后将继续推广种植小麦。
    和长安县自然条件相同的秦岭山下，还有二百多万亩稻田。陕西省农业厅准备在这个地区逐步推广稻、麦两熟的经验，预计全部推广后每年最少可为国家增产小麦两亿多斤。（新华社）
