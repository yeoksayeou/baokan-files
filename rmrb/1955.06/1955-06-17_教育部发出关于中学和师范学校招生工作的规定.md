    The Ministry of Education issued regulations on enrollment work for middle schools and teacher training schools on June 10th. The regulations point out that doing a good job in the enrollment work for middle schools and teacher training schools is one of the most important keys to ensuring the realization of the national education construction plan. All regions should strengthen leadership over enrollment work and conduct comprehensive and serious assessments of candidates in order to implement the policy of improving the quality of education and ensure the completion of the enrollment plan. The enrollment work for middle schools and teacher training schools is to be led uniformly by the provinces and cities. In the future, except for individual areas where it is necessary to implement unified enrollment, generally, joint enrollment of schools in the same area or separate enrollment by each school should be adopted according to the specific situation. Each province and city should organize a secondary school enrollment committee.
    The regulations point out that anyone who has graduated from senior primary school or has equivalent academic ability can apply for junior middle school and junior normal school; anyone who has graduated from junior middle school or has equivalent academic ability can apply for senior middle school and normal school. The age for admission to junior middle school is generally 12 full years of age, and the age for admission to senior middle school is generally 15 full years of age. When specifically stipulating the age of admission, each region may appropriately relax or tighten these ages with reference to the actual age of the current senior primary and junior middle school graduates in the local area. The age of admission for normal school students is 15 to 30 full years of age. Junior normal schools in minority areas may recruit senior primary school graduates or students with equivalent academic ability who are only under 25 years of age. Senior primary school graduates applying for junior middle school and junior normal school, or junior middle school graduates applying for senior middle school and normal school, must submit graduation certificates and conduct evaluation materials from their original schools. Candidates with equivalent academic ability must submit relevant academic reference documents and household registration certificates from the local police station. If the candidate has attended primary or junior middle school, they must hold a certificate of study from the original school. Demobilized and transferred soldiers and on-the-job cadres must have certification documents from their original service units. Students must not falsely report their education or forge documents when applying. Applicants should submit health certificates whenever possible.
    The date for the entrance examinations for junior and senior middle schools and normal schools is generally stipulated to be held from July 21st to 25th each year. The provincial and municipal enrollment committees may uniformly stipulate according to the specific situation. All regions should actively persuade students to apply for schools in their region.
    In principle, the examination subjects are stipulated as follows: junior middle school and junior normal school examine Chinese language and arithmetic; senior middle school and normal school examine Chinese language, mathematics (including arithmetic, algebra, and plane geometry), and political common sense. However, all regions must pay attention to doing ideological work for teachers and students so that they realize that the entrance examination is mainly to test students' understanding and mastery of knowledge in certain subjects, and it is not necessary to test all subjects. During their studies in senior primary school and junior middle school, students must study all subjects seriously and lay a solid foundation. For the 1955 examination subjects, each region may also refer to past practices and stipulate them independently. When admitting new students, we must be prudent and strict, consider students' examination results and physical condition, and take into account conduct scores, etc., and select the best candidates. When determining the admission of new students, preferential treatment should be given to the families of revolutionary martyrs, and other preferential treatment objects may be determined according to the specific situation of the local area, but it must be noted that the principle of ensuring quality must be grasped.
    The regulations point out that in order to encourage students to pay attention to their usual studies at school and inspire them to consciously achieve good health, good grades, and good conduct during their studies, in the future, middle schools and normal schools should plan to gradually implement the method of recommending students for further education. A portion of senior primary and junior middle school graduates with excellent character and learning and good health are recommended to be admitted to junior and senior middle schools and normal schools without examination.
    The regulations emphasize that strengthening the ideological education work of the current graduating class is an important link in doing a good job in enrollment work. All regions should, in accordance with the "Publicity Outline on Senior Primary and Junior Middle School Graduates Engaging in Labor Production" issued by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 22, 1954, further strengthen guidance and education for students on further education and employment on the basis of past implementation of labor education. Students undergo greater ideological changes and have more questions before, during, and after registration, examination, and announcement of results. All schools must pay close attention to the work of class teachers, organize teachers of various subjects to cooperate with the Communist Youth League, student union and other organizations, and contact the students' parents to conduct in-depth and meticulous education in light of the ideological characteristics of students at different periods to establish their correct attitude towards further education and engaging in industrial and agricultural labor production. At the same time, various effective methods should be used to conduct publicity and education to all sectors of society to form new social public opinion to influence and educate students.

    教育部发出关于中学和师范学校招生工作的规定
    教育部在六月十日发出关于中学和师范学校招生工作的规定。规定指出：做好中学和师范学校的招生工作，是保证实现国家教育建设计划的重要关键之一。各地区对于招生工作应加强领导，对于考生应进行全面、认真的考核。以贯彻提高教育质量的方针，保证招生计划的完成。中学和师范学校的招生工作以省、市为单位统一领导进行。今后除个别地区有必要实行统一招生外，一般应根据具体情况，采取同一地区的学校联合招生或由各校单独进行招生的办法。各省、市应组织中等学校招生委员会。
    规定指出：凡在高小毕业或具有同等学力者可报考初级中学和初级师范学校；凡在初级中学毕业或具有同等学力者可报考高级中学和师范学校。入学年龄，初级中学以十二足岁、高级中学以十五足岁为原则。各地区在具体规定入学年龄时，可参照当地本届高小及初级中学毕业生的实际年龄酌予伸缩。师范学校学生的入学年龄为十五足岁至三十足岁。少数民族地区的初级师范学校可招收年仅在二十五岁以下的高小毕业或具有同等学力的学生。高小毕业生报考初级中学和初级师范学校，或初级中学毕业生报考高级中学和师范学校，须缴验毕业证明书及原校操行评定材料。同等学力的考生须缴验有关文化程度的参考证件和当地派出所的户口证明。如系进过小学或初级中学的考生须持原肄业学校的修业证明文件。复员转业军人、在职干部须有原服务机关的证明文件。学生报考时不得虚报学历和伪造证件。报考生应尽可能缴验健康证明。
    初、高级中学和师范学校招生考试日期规定在每年七月二十一日至二十五日举行为原则。省、市招生委员会可根据具体情况，统一规定。各地区应积极说服学生在本地区投考学校。
    考试科目原则上规定：初级中学和初级师范学校考试语文、算术；高级中学和师范学校考试语文、数学（包括算术、代数、平面几何）、政治常识。但各地区必须注意对教师和学生做好思想工作，使他们认识到升学考试主要是测验学生对某些学科的知识的理解和掌握程度，不必要考试所有学科。学生在高小和初级中学学习期间，对于各门学科必须认真学习，打好基础。一九五五年的考试科目，各地区也可以参照过去办法，自行规定。录取新生时必须审慎严格，根据学生考试成绩、身体条件、并参考操行成绩等全面考虑，择优录取。确定录取新生时，对烈属应予以照顾，其余照顾对象可根据当地具体情况决定，但必须注意掌握保证质量的原则。
    规定指出：为了鼓励学生重视在校的平时学习，启发他们在学习期间能自觉地做到身体好、功课好、品行好，今后中学和师范学校招生应有计划地逐步实行保送升学办法。保送一部分品学兼优、身体健康的高小和初级中学毕业生免试升入初、高级中学和师范学校。
    规定强调了加强应届毕业生的思想教育工作，是做好招生工作的重要环节。各地区应根据中共中央宣传部一九五四年五月二十二日发出的“关于高小和初中毕业生从事劳动生产宣传提纲”，在过去实施劳动教育的基础上，进一步加强对学生的升学就业指导教育。学生在报名、考试、发榜的前后，思想变化较大，问题较多，各校必须抓紧班主任工作，组织各科教师会同青年团、学生会等组织，并联系学生家长，针对学生各个不同时期的思想特点，深入细致地进行教育，树立他们对待升学和从事工农业劳动生产的正确态度。同时并运用各种有效的方式向社会各阶层进行宣传教育，形成新的社会舆论，以影响和教育学生。            （新华社）
