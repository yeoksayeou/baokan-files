An Open Letter to Parents, Educators, and Childcare Workers
Song Qingling

Today, our entire nation is once again celebrating International Children's Day. As always, this is a very joyful day for us. For parents, educators, and childcare workers—for all of us who are directly responsible for the well-being and healthy development of children—this is a day of particular significance.

On this day, we should not only be happy for our children, but also seriously consider the attitude we hold towards them at home, during play, in nurseries, and in schools. This should now become our habit. As we struggle to build socialism and defend our motherland, and as we raise our political awareness and ideological level, we must ensure that there are no backward views in our social life, and pay special attention to how these affect our children.

We show our love for children by increasingly caring for their physical and mental progress. This is a principle of socialist society and of people who have begun to build socialism. Our primary concern is for children. But ours is not the individualistic way of caring in capitalist societies, which favors the few and discriminates against the many. Instead, it is the collective, socialist way of caring, which means constantly increasing the funds and efforts spent on the vast number of children.

This fundamental principle is directly reflected in our Constitution. Article 94 of the Constitution stipulates: "The state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people." Article 96 stipulates: "Marriage, family, mothers, and children are protected by the state." Therefore, ensuring the healthy development of every child in our country is the goal and obligation of every citizen of our country.

Undoubtedly, we are working hard to achieve this goal. Looking back over the short span of five years, no one can fail to see our tremendous progress. Not only is family life in both urban and rural areas economically improving and constantly developing, but one can also see new maternity hospitals, schools, nurseries, cultural facilities, and sports venues being established everywhere. We can be happy for our children because of these advances. This will encourage each of us to work harder to increase production and improve work efficiency, in order to ensure the continuous development of this construction.

But while this progress is gratifying, we must never forget one thing. What children need most is our love and guidance. Without these, the most comfortable material enjoyments in the world are of little value. What is required of us is not just ordinary care, but something that is constantly improving in quality. For today's Chinese children are being educated in a country that is building a new life and accomplishing heroic achievements every day.

The society in which we live, because of the magnificent tasks it has set for itself, cherishes every individual. Our wish is that each of us will develop to the fullest and make the greatest contribution, so that the individual can, together with all his compatriots, increase his well-being. Such a society generates a love and affection for children that was impossible in the old society, where human feelings rarely extended beyond the circle of one's own family. This new feeling arises from the new environment we are creating. It not only expresses deep affection for a particular child, but goes far beyond this range. Because of the significance of children to society as a whole, they are cherished by the people. This is an emotion that is infinite in depth, expression, and strength. With this love and affection, parents, educators, and childcare workers can do unparalleled work for children in both quality and quantity.

As you can see, the standard by which we measure our attitude towards children is very high. How many of us, whether parents, educators, or childcare workers, can say that we meet this standard? Most of us probably feel that we have done our best. But life requires our love to be deeper than before, and this is not something that can be done without thought and effort.

In fact, some people, including parents and child workers, do not connect the era in which we live with their attitude towards children. There are still cases of parents beating their children or engaging in other forms of abuse. Some childcare workers and educators, due to their own shortcomings and lack of self-criticism, lack confidence in their responsibilities, and resort to foolish punishments and violence. Of course, these are very special examples, but we cannot deny that such situations exist. As long as this situation exists, it shows that our attitude in general is still flawed, and that there is still a distance between our old way of thinking and the reality of our new life.

We must point out to those who use any form of coercion and violence that this is not only wrong from the point of view of educating children, but also a violation of national law and a crime. We must also point out to those who take a laissez-faire attitude towards children: you have failed the trust that society has placed in you, because society has given every parent, educator, and childcare worker a solemn responsibility: to educate our future citizens, to make them honest, brave, loving of work, loving of the motherland, loving of their compatriots, and to have a spirit of comradely friendship. This is a responsibility that cannot be taken lightly, and it is not something that can be treated with indifference. Each of us must do our best to cultivate the above-mentioned virtues in ourselves, and then we can educate our younger generation to have these virtues.

Parents must provide families full of love, principles, and meaning, because the family is a basic unit for educating children. Educators and childcare workers must treat their work with a high sense of responsibility and with genuine love for children, so that they can gain the motivation to work proactively and creatively. Both the family and the work with children outside the family must strive to make full use of the material conditions that our society provides in its progress. We must ensure that our children are loved everywhere; we must take care of them meticulously; we must fulfill our responsibility to our great motherland, so that its children become people of noble character, builders of socialism and communism.

Can we meet this requirement? I tell you, I firmly believe that we can. To commemorate this day, every parent, educator, and childcare worker should devote himself (herself) even better to this goal. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 致父母、教育工作者和儿童保育工作者的一封公开信

    致父母、教育工作者和儿童保育工作者的一封公开信
    宋庆龄
    今天，我们全国又在庆祝国际儿童节了。像往常一样，这是我们的一个非常愉快的日子。对于父母、教育工作者、儿童保育工作者来说，对于我们这些直接对儿童的幸福负责和对他们的健全发展负责的人来说，这是一个具有特别重要意义的日子。
    在这一天，我们不仅要为我们的儿童高兴，同时我们也要严肃地考虑一下我们在家里、在玩的时候、在托儿所里和在学校里对他们抱着怎样的态度。这一点，现在应当成为我们的习惯了。在我们进行建设社会主义和保卫我们祖国的斗争的同时，在我们提高我们的政治认识和思想水平的同时，我们必须保证我们在社会生活中不要存在落后的看法，特别要注意在这些方面给孩子们带来了怎样的影响。
    我们是通过越来越多地关怀儿童身心的进步，来表示我们对他们的爱护的，这是社会主义社会和已经开始建设社会主义的人们的一个原则。对于我们来说，首先关怀的是儿童。但我们不是那种优待少数、歧视多数的资本主义社会个人主义方式的关怀，而是集体的社会主义方式的关怀，那便是不断增加花在广大儿童身上的经费和精力。
    这个基本原则直接反映在我们的宪法中。宪法第九十四条规定：国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展。第九十六条规定：婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护。因此，保证我们国家每个儿童的健全发展是我国每个公民的目标和义务。
    毫无疑问，我们正在努力达到这个目标。在回顾短短五年的时间里，没有人会看不到我们的巨大进步。不仅城乡家庭生活在经济上正在好转和不断改善，而且人们可以看到各处都建立了新的产科医院、学校、托儿所、文化设施和运动场所等。我们可以由于这些进展而为我们的儿童感到高兴。这将鼓励我们每一个人更努力地增加生产和提高工作效率，以便保证这种建设的不断发展。
    但是这种进展虽然是令人高兴的，我们却绝不可忘记一件事。儿童们最需要的是我们爱护和指导。没有这些，世上最舒适的物质享受也是没有什么价值的。要求于我们的还不是普通的关怀，而是某种在质量上不断提高的东西。因为今天中国的儿童是在一个正在建设新生活、每天完成着英勇业绩的国家中受教养的。
    我们所生活的社会里，由于它为自己规定的宏伟任务，是珍视每一个人的。我们的愿望是我们每一个人得到最充分的发展，作出最大的贡献，这样，个人就能同他的全体同胞一道增进他的福利。这样一种社会所产生的对儿童的热爱和感情，在旧社会里是不可能存在的，在旧社会里，人的感情很难超出他自己的家庭的圈子。这种新感情是从我们正在创造的新环境里产生出来的。这不仅表现了对某一个儿童的深挚感情，而且远远超过这个范围，由于儿童对整个社会所具有的意义，他得到了人们的珍视。这是一种在深度上、表现方法上和力量上都是无限的感情。具有了这种热爱和感情，父母、教育工作者和儿童保育工作者就能为儿童做出在质和量上都是无可比拟的工作。
    大家可以看到，我们衡量我们对儿童的态度的标准是非常高的。我们，不论是父母、教育工作者还是儿童保育工作者，有多少人能够说我们符合这个标准呢？我们大多数人大概都觉得我们是尽到了我们最大的力量了。但是生活要求我们的爱护要比以前更深，而这是一件不经思考和努力就做不到的事情。
    事实上，有些人，包括父母和儿童工作者在内，根本不把我们所生活的时代和他们对儿童的态度联系起来。还有父母打子女或进行其他虐待的事情。有些保育工作者和教育工作者，由于自己存在缺点和缺乏自我批评，因而对他们的责任缺乏信心，以致施行愚蠢的惩罚并使用暴力。当然，这些都是非常特殊的例子，但是我们不能否认是有这样的情况存在。只要这种情况存在一天，这就说明我们的态度一般说来还有缺陷，我们的旧思想方式同我们的新生活现实之间还有距离。
    我们必须对使用任何形式的强迫和暴力的人们指出：这不仅从教育儿童的观点来说是错误的，而且也是违反国法的，是一种罪行。我们还必须对那些对儿童采取放任态度的人们指出：你们辜负了社会对你们的委托，因为社会交给每一位父母、教育工作者和儿童保育工作者一个庄严的责任：教养我们的未来的公民，使他们诚实、勇敢，爱工作，爱祖国、爱同胞，并且有同志般的友爱精神。这是一个不能轻率对待的责任，也是不能采取冷淡态度来对待的事情。我们每一个人必须尽全部力量使我们自己具有上述的品德，然后我们才能教育我们的年轻一代，使他们具有这种品德。
    父母必须提供充满了爱、有原则和有意义的家庭，因为家庭是对儿童进行教育的一个基本单位。教育工作者和儿童保育工作者必须以高度的责任心，以充满了对儿童的真诚的爱，来对待自己的工作，这样才能获得主动性地和创造性地进行工作的动力。家庭和在家庭以外进行的儿童工作，都必须努力充分利用我们的社会在它前进中提供的物质条件。我们必须使我们的儿童处处受到爱护；我们必须无微不至地照顾他们；我们必须履行我们对我们伟大祖国的责任，使它的儿女成为具有高贵品质的人，成为社会主义和共产主义的建设者。
    我们能满足这个要求吗？我对你们说，我完全相信我们能够。为纪念这个日子，每一个父母、教育工作者和儿童保育工作者应当使他（她）自己更好地献身于这个目标。　（新华社）
