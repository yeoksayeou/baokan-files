    Hulunbuir League Re-plans State-owned Stock Farms
    The Hulunbuir League State-owned Stock Farm Construction Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has made new plans for the construction of state-owned stock farms throughout the league. It has been decided to readjust and merge the original thirty-four farms into fourteen state-owned stock farms based on various conditions such as water and grass, transportation, soil quality, and climate. Among them, there are ten cattle farms, three horse farms, and one breeding farm. Each cattle farm also has three sub-farms. The new plan also includes three mechanized farming farms and eleven small farms for growing feed for the state-owned stock farms. Most of these state-owned stock farms are located in areas with convenient transportation and abundant water sources along the railway line from Manzhouli to Yakeshi; some farms are also located in the fertile southwestern part of Ergun Banner.
    The Construction Committee has formulated a basic construction plan for the stock farms based on the new plan. The construction plan shows that when all fourteen local state-owned stock farms in the league are completed, new buildings will appear on the vast grasslands stretching hundreds of miles on both sides of the railway from Manzhouli in the west to Yakeshi in the east. These include neat, clean, and well-ventilated cattle sheds and stables, as well as veterinary treatment rooms, machinery warehouses, machinery power rooms, warm cellars, silage cellars, staff dormitories, offices, canteens, and clubs. The total construction area is more than 267,000 square meters, which is planned to be completed in batches over the next few years. In 1955, four cattle farms, eleven sub-farms, and one mechanized farming farm will be basically completed, and the main projects of four other cattle farms will be completed. The stock farm construction personnel are currently stepping up the preparation of materials. A large amount of wood used for construction has been transported from the forest area to processing factories for processing. Construction is expected to begin in June. (Yun Ling)

    呼伦贝尔盟重新规划国营牧场
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟国营牧场建场委员会，对全盟国营牧场的建设已作了新的规划，决定把原有的三十四个场，根据水草、交通、土质、气候等各种条件，重新调整合并为十四个国营牧场，其中有牛场十处，马场三处，种畜场一处。每个牛场还有三个分场。新的规划中还包括为国营牧场种植饲料的三处机耕农场和十一处小型农场。这些国营牧场大部分设立在从满洲里到牙克石铁路沿线交通方便、水源充足地带；还有一部分牧场设立在土地肥沃的额尔古纳旗西南部。
    建场委员会已根据新的规划，制定了牧场基本建设规划。建设规划中显示：在全盟十四个地方国营牧场全部建成时，西起满洲里东到牙克石沿铁路两侧数百里的广阔草原上，将出现一座座崭新的建筑物。其中有整齐清洁和空气阳光充足的牛舍和马厩，还有兽医治疗室、机械库、机械动力房、暖窖、青贮窖及职工宿舍、办公室、食堂和俱乐部等。全部建筑共有二十六万七千多平方公尺，计划在今后数年内分批建成。一九五五年将基本建成四处牛场，十一处分场和一处机耕农场，另有四处牛场要完成主要工程。牧场建设人员现正加紧进行备料工作。建筑所用的大量木料已由林区运至加工工厂进行加工。六月份内即可开始施工。　（云灵）
