Xinhua News Agency, London, June 15th: The strike of 70,000 British railway engine drivers and stokers, after seventeen days of persistent struggle, ended on the evening of the 14th because the Conservative government was forced to accept the workers' demands in principle. The strike began on May 29th. The cause of the strike was the Conservative government's policy of arms expansion and war preparation, which stimulated continuous price increases, while the workers' demands for wage increases were repeatedly rejected.

After the strike began, the Conservative government repeatedly attempted to induce the workers to abandon their reasonable demands, and even threatened the striking workers on May 31st by declaring a "state of emergency" in Britain. However, with the strong support of the broad masses of working people throughout the country, the striking workers united and persisted in their strike. Only after the strike seriously damaged Britain's war economy did the Conservative government have to make concessions to the workers.

    英国七万名铁路工人罢工胜利结束
    新华社十五日讯　伦敦消息：英国七万名铁路机车司机司炉工人的罢工，经过十七天的坚持斗争，已经因保守党政府被迫在原则上接受工人的要求而在十四日晚宣告结束。这次罢工是从五月二十九日开始的。罢工的起因是保守党政府的扩军备战政策刺激了物价不断上涨，而工人们关于增加工资的要求都一再遭到拒绝。
    罢工开始后，保守党政府一再企图诱使工人放弃他们的合理要求，甚至在五月三十一日以宣布英国进入“紧急状态”来威胁罢工工人。但是，罢工工人在全国广大劳动人民的有力声援下，团结一致地坚持罢工。只是在罢工使得英国的战争经济遭到了严重打击之后，保守党政府才不得不向工人让步。
