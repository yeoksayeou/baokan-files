    One year ago today, on June 28, 1954, the Prime Ministers of the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of India issued a joint statement affirming the Five Principles guiding relations between the two countries: (1) mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty; (2) non-aggression; (3) non-interference in internal affairs; (4) equality and mutual benefit; (5) peaceful coexistence. The Prime Ministers of China and India believed that these principles should also apply to their relations with other countries in Asia and the world. Subsequently, the Prime Ministers of China and Burma also agreed in a joint statement that the Five Principles should serve as the basis for guiding relations between the two countries and expressed the hope that all countries would abide by these principles. The issuance of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese joint statements was an important event in the political lives of the peoples of China, India, and Burma, as well as in Asian and international relations as a whole. As everyone knows, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was the first to respond to the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese joint statements. The Sino-Soviet joint declaration and the Sino-Indonesian joint statement also affirmed these principles. These principles have also been confirmed in the Soviet-Yugoslav joint statement and the Polish-Indian joint statement. The spirit of the Five Principles runs through other important international documents. There is no doubt that the influence of the Five Principles has increasingly penetrated people's hearts. The Chinese people are pleased to congratulate the Five Principles on the great achievements made in all aspects over the past year.
    First of all, it should be pointed out that, due to the strict adherence to the spirit of the Five Principles by the governments and peoples of China, India, and Burma in handling their mutual affairs and matters of common concern, the friendly and cooperative relations between China, India, and Burma have developed in new ways in political, economic, and cultural aspects over the past year. On the basis of the Five Principles, China, India, and Burma have not only established mutual trust, but also made joint and effective efforts to address pressing international issues. This vividly proves that peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is entirely possible as long as there is sincerity in abiding by the Five Principles; expanding the scope of application of the Five Principles is of positive significance for promoting the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
    Since the Geneva Conference, one of the most prominent features in the development of the international situation has been that, in the complex, sharp, and repeated struggle between international peace forces and war forces, the Five Principles have received increasingly widespread recognition and support throughout the world, especially in the Asian-African region.
    The principles established by the Geneva Conference for resolving the political issues of the three Indochinese countries, namely, the principle that the participating countries recognize and guarantee the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the three Indochinese countries, and do not interfere in their internal affairs in any way, are entirely consistent with the spirit of the Five Principles. The achievements of the Geneva Conference set a good example for the peaceful resolution of major international issues based on the Five Principles. This is a major victory for the forces of peace.
    The Five Principles were further developed at the Asian-African Conference. The gathering of twenty-nine Asian-African countries with different social systems to exchange views on maintaining national independence, ensuring peace, and promoting friendly cooperation in order to enhance mutual understanding and recognition is itself a positive manifestation of peaceful coexistence. The resolutions adopted by the Asian-African Conference fully embody the common aspirations of the Asian-African peoples for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation. The Ten Principles put forward in the Asian-African Conference's declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation not only conform to the Five Principles advocated by China, India, and Burma, but also extend and develop them. This is another major victory for the forces of peace.
    It is particularly worth mentioning that Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru recently reiterated their continued adherence to the Five Principles in their bilateral relations. In their joint statement, Bulganin and Nehru emphasized that wider recognition of these principles could expand the zone of peace, help establish mutual trust between countries, and pave the way for closer international cooperation. In such a peacefully established environment, it would be possible to seek peaceful solutions to international problems through negotiations and reconciliation.
    Peace-loving people and fair-minded public opinion around the world warmly welcome the joint statement of the leaders of the Soviet and Indian governments because it applies the Five Principles to a wider scope and calls upon other countries to take practical actions to prove that they are indeed sincere in peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation. This cannot but have an impact on the development of the current international situation that is favorable to the forces of peace and unfavorable to the forces of war.
    As everyone knows, the American aggressive bloc has always opposed peaceful coexistence and been hostile to the Five Principles, because the so-called policy of strength runs counter to the Five Principles, and the conspiracy to maintain and intensify international tension is fundamentally opposed to the principle of peaceful coexistence. The American aggressive bloc fully understands that the continuous expansion of the influence of the Five Principles means the continuous failure of the "policy of strength" and will lead to its final bankruptcy. Therefore, whenever international peace forces take active steps to ease international tensions, the adherents of the "policy of strength" take the opposite measures aimed at continuing to maintain and intensify international tensions. After the Geneva Conference, the American aggressive bloc plotted the Manila Treaty in Asia, worsening the atmosphere in the Far East, and instigated the Paris Agreements in Europe, greatly increasing the danger of war in the West. After the Asian-African Conference, the American aggressive bloc stepped up its coercion of the Manila Treaty member states to further serve its aggressive policy, intensified its conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords in Indochina, and intensified its war activities in the Taiwan area aimed at the People's Republic of China. Recently, due to a series of major steps taken by the Soviet Union, some signs of easing have appeared in the international tension caused by the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements. People all over the world demand that other countries make the corresponding efforts to end the "Cold War," establish the necessary trust in international relations, create favorable conditions for peaceful coexistence. However, the adherents of the "policy of strength" are painstakingly trying to undermine this possibility in all aspects.
    On the eve of the summit conference of the four powers of the Soviet Union, France, Britain and the United States, the speech delivered by US Secretary of State Dulles at the commemorative meeting of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is a powerful proof that the US aggressive bloc attempts to continue to adhere to the "policy of strength", continue to maintain the "Cold War" state, and continue to oppose easing international tension on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence. Completely disregarding facts and logic, Dulles insisted on describing the recent signs of easing in the international situation as the result of the US pursuit of the "policy of strength," and insisted on describing the struggle of the peoples of various countries to maintain independence and sovereignty as a threat to international peace. Even more absurd, Dulles openly slandered the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" and openly expressed his intention to subvert the Eastern European people's democratic countries that are building socialism. This cannot but arouse great anger and severe condemnation from all countries that are willing to peacefully coexist in accordance with the Five Principles.
    However, the influence of the Five Principles is irresistible, and the demand for peaceful coexistence is unstoppable. The American "policy of strength" adherents' distortion of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, their slander of the people's democratic countries, and their hostility to the Five Principles and the Asian countries that are striving to maintain the Five Principles do not show its strength but only its cowardice.
    The Chinese people will, together with the peace-loving people of the world, continue to strive to further expand the influence of the Five Principles, to defend world peace, to oppose wars of aggression, and to realize the peaceful coexistence of all countries in the world.

### 进一步扩大五项原则的影响

    进一步扩大五项原则的影响
    一年以前的今天，中华人民共和国和印度共和国两国总理发表联合声明，肯定了指导两国关系的五项原则：（一）互相尊重领土主权；（二）互不侵犯；（三）互不干涉内政；（四）平等互利；（五）和平共处。中印两国总理认为这些原则还应该适用于他们同亚洲和世界其他国家之间的关系。接着，中国和缅甸两国总理在联合声明中也同意五项原则应该成为指导两国关系的根据，并希望一切国家都能遵守这些原则。中印、中缅总理联合声明的发表是中国、印度、缅甸三国人民的政治生活中的重要事件，也是亚洲和整个国际关系中的重要事件。大家知道，越南民主共和国首先响应了中印、中缅联合声明。中国和苏联的联合宣言以及中国和印度尼西亚的联合声明也肯定了这些原则。这些原则同样在苏联和南斯拉夫的联合声明中、在波兰和印度的联合声明中也得到了确认。五项原则的精神是贯串在其他一些重要的国际文件中。毫无疑问，五项原则的影响已日益深入人心。中国人民以满意的心情来祝贺五项原则一年来在各方面所取得的巨大成就。
    首先应该指出，由于中国、印度和缅甸三国政府和人民严格地按照五项原则的精神来处理相互之间的和共同有关的事务，一年来，中、印、缅三国之间的友好合作关系，不论是在政治、经济或文化各方面，都有了新的发展。在五项原则的基础上，中、印、缅三国之间不仅建立了互信，并且对当前国际间的迫切问题进行了共同的有成效的努力。这就活生生地证明：只要具有遵守五项原则的诚意，不同社会制度的国家和平共处是完全可能的；扩大适用五项原则的范围对促进亚洲地区和全世界的和平事业是有积极意义的。
    日内瓦会议后，国际形势发展中的一个最显著的特点是：在国际和平力量同战争势力进行着复杂的、尖锐的和反复的斗争过程中，五项原则在全世界的范围内特别是在亚非地区内受到越来越广泛的承认和支持。
    日内瓦会议规定的关于解决印度支那三国政治问题的原则，即与会国承认保证印度支那三国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整，并对它们的内政不加以任何干涉的原则，同五项原则的精神是完全一致的。日内瓦会议的成就，为根据五项原则和平解决当前重大国际问题树立良好的范例。这是和平力量的一个重大胜利。
    五项原则在亚非会议上获得了进一步的发展。二十九个社会制度不同的亚非国家聚首一堂，就维护民族独立保障和平和促进友好合作问题交换意见，以便增进相互了解和认识，这一件事情的本身就是和平共处的积极表现。亚非会议所通过的各项决议充分地体现了亚非人民对和平共处和友好合作的共同愿望。亚非会议关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言中所提出的十项原则，不仅符合中印和中缅所倡导的五项原则，并且加以引伸和发展。这是和平力量的又一个重大胜利。
    特别值得提出的是，最近苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和印度总理尼赫鲁重申在两国关系中继续遵循五项原则。布尔加宁主席和尼赫鲁总理在联合声明中着重指出：这些原则得到更广泛的承认可以扩大和平地区，有助于树立各国之间的相互信任，并为更紧密的国际合作铺平道路。在这样建立起来的和平环境中，就有可能用谈判及和解的办法谋求国际问题的和平解决。
    全世界爱好和平的人民和公正舆论，热烈欢迎苏印两国政府领袖的联合声明，因为它把五项原则应用到更广泛的范围，并要求其他的一些国家也采取实际的行动来证明他们确有和平共处、友好合作的诚意。这对于目前国际形势的发展，不能不发生有利于和平力量而不利于战争势力的影响。
    大家知道，美国侵略集团一向反对和平共处，仇视五项原则，因为所谓实力政策是同五项原则背道而驰的，保持和加剧国际紧张局势的阴谋是同和平共处的原则根本相反的。美国侵略集团完全懂得，五项原则影响的不断扩大，意味着“实力政策”的不断失败，并将导向最后的破产。因此，每当国际和平力量采取主动的积极的步骤，从而使国际紧张局势趋向缓和的时候，“实力政策”的奉行者却采取相反的旨在继续保持并加剧国际紧张局势的措施。日内瓦会议以后，美国侵略集团在亚洲策划组织了马尼拉条约，恶化远东的气氛，在欧洲策动了巴黎协定，使西方的战争危险大为增长。亚非会议以后，美国侵略集团加紧胁迫马尼拉条约成员国进一步为它的侵略政策服务，在印度支那加紧展开破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋，在台湾地区加紧进行以中华人民共和国为目标的战争活动。最近，由于苏联采取一系列的重大步骤，因批准和实施巴黎协定所造成的国际紧张局势又出现了一些缓和的迹象。全世界人民要求其他国家作相应的努力来结束“冷战”，建立国际关系中的必要信任，创造和平共处的有利条件。但是，“实力政策”的奉行者正处心积虑地从各方面来破坏这种可能性。
    在苏、法、英、美四国首脑会议的前夕，美国国务卿杜勒斯在联合国成立十周年的纪念会上发表的演说，就是美国侵略集团企图继续坚持“实力政策”，继续保持“冷战”状态，继续反对在和平共处各项原则的基础上来缓和国际紧张局势的有力证明。杜勒斯完全不顾事实和逻辑，硬把最近国际局势中的缓和迹象，说成是美国推行“实力政策”的结果，硬把各国人民维护独立和主权的斗争，说成是对国际和平的威胁。更荒谬的是，杜勒斯又公然诬蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”，并公然表示要颠覆正在建设社会主义的东欧各人民民主国家。这就不能不引起所有愿意按照五项原则而和平共处的各国人民的极大愤怒和严厉谴责。
    但是，五项原则的影响是不可抗拒的，和平共处的要求是不可阻挠的。美国“实力政策”的奉行者对苏联和平政策的歪曲，对各人民民主国家的诬蔑，对五项原则以及为维护五项原则而努力的亚洲国家的敌视，决不表示它的强大而只是它的怯弱的表现。
    中国人民将同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，为进一步扩大五项原则的影响，为保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争，为实现世界各国的和平共处而继续奋斗。
