Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China and the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China jointly held a judicial symposium from May 26th to June 17th.

Attending the symposium were the presidents of the Higher People's Courts and the directors (bureaus) of the Justice Departments of various provinces and cities, and the presidents of the Intermediate People's Courts and the directors of the Justice Bureaus of eleven cities. During the symposium, Dong Biwu, President of the Supreme People's Court, and Luo Ruiqing, Director of the First Office of the State Council, delivered important reports to the meeting.

The symposium reviewed the learning and implementation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts in various regions. Over the past seven months, the People's Courts at all levels have achieved great success in learning and implementing the Organic Law of the People's Courts. In areas where People's Congress meetings have already been held, presidents of the local Higher People's Courts, Intermediate People's Courts, and Basic People's Courts have been elected in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Some areas have strengthened the organizational structure of the People's Courts; People's Courts at all levels have established or are in the process of establishing various trial systems.

The symposium focused on how to combat counter-revolutionaries and various criminals through adjudication activities. Attendees unanimously agreed that: suppressing enemies and punishing criminals through adjudication activities, protecting the people, so as to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and ensure the smooth progress of the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, is the fundamental task of the People's Courts, and also a regular and central task. Courts in all regions must adopt a resolute attitude and give severe blows to the sabotage activities of all counter-revolutionaries and various criminals frequently and in a planned manner.

When studying the implementation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts and the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and various criminals, the symposium also combined this with the study of vigorously improving the style of adjudication. The meeting believed that the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and various criminals is completely consistent with the implementation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts and the improvement of the style of adjudication. Only by resolutely and correctly implementing the Organic Law of the People's Courts and vigorously improving the style of adjudication can the adjudication work in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and various criminals be both legal and swift and powerful.

The symposium also studied the summary of experience in the procedures for handling criminal and civil cases by the People's Courts of fourteen large and medium-sized cities, including Beijing and Tianjin, and initially unified the procedures for adjudication work in urban courts.

    最高人民法院和司法部召开司法座谈会
    确定加强运用审判武器镇压反革命分子
    据新华社二十八日讯　中华人民共和国最高人民法院和中华人民共和国司法部在五月二十六日到六月十七日联合召开了司法座谈会。
    出席座谈会的有各省、市的高级人民法院院长和司法厅（局）长，十一个城市的中级人民法院院长和司法局局长。座谈会期间，最高人民法院院长董必武和国务院第一办公室主任罗瑞卿先后到会作了重要报告。
    座谈会检查了各地学习和贯彻人民法院组织法的情况。七个多月来，各级人民法院学习和贯彻人民法院组织法取得了很大成绩，凡是已经开过人民代表大会会议的地区，都依照宪法规定分别选举了当地的高级人民法院、中级人民法院和基层人民法院的院长，有些地区加强了人民法院的组织机构；各级人民法院都建立了或正在建立各项审判制度。
    座谈会着重研究了如何通过审判活动打击反革命分子和各种犯罪分子的问题。出席会议的人一致认为：通过审判活动镇压敌人，惩罚犯罪，保护人民，以巩固人民民主专政，保障国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，是人民法院的根本任务，也是经常的中心任务。各地法院必须采取坚决的态度，对一切反革命分子和各种犯罪分子的破坏活动，经常地、有计划地给以严厉的打击。
    座谈会在研究贯彻人民法院组织法和对反革命分子及各种犯罪分子进行斗争时，还结合研究了大力改善审判作风的问题。会议认为，对反革命分子和各种犯罪分子的斗争与贯彻人民法院组织法、改善审判作风是完全一致的。只有坚决、正确地贯彻人民法院组织法，大力改善审判作风，才能使审判工作在同反革命分子和各种犯罪分子的斗争中，做到既合法，又迅速有力。
    座谈会还研究了北京、天津等十四个大中城市人民法院审理刑事、民事案件程序的经验总结，初步统一了城市法院审判工作的程序。
