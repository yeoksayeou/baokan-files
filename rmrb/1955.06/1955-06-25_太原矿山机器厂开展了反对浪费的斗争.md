The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant Launches Struggle Against Waste
Li Qiansheng

On May 20th, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of Party activists. At the meeting, many serious instances of waste were revealed. After the meeting, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant formulated a conservation plan and adopted a series of concrete measures to overcome waste.

What are the serious instances of waste at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant? First, the utilization rate of metal materials is too low. In the first quarter, the plant's metal material utilization rate was less than 70%, with nodular cast iron utilization being only 22%. This means that for every 100 tons of nodular cast iron poured, only 22 tons of qualified castings are produced. According to calculations from a focused inspection of material usage, the metal materials used for eighteen products in the first quarter exceeded the plan by 31%, which is an excess of 199 tons.

Waste caused by low quality and numerous defective products is also considerable. Defective product losses in the first quarter of this year reached 62,353 yuan, equivalent to half a year's defective product losses last year.

Due to poor technical preparation and uneven production, non-production time such as work stoppages waiting for materials has increased. Taking January's non-production time as 100, February's was 107.5, and March's was 130. The total non-production time for the quarter was 32,425 man-hours, accounting for 5.86% of the total actual working hours. Calculated at the lowest average output value per man-hour, this represents a loss of 129,700 yuan in wealth for the state.

The consumption of cutting tools is also increasing monthly. Comparing the actual consumption in the first quarter of this year with the actual consumption in the fourth quarter of last year: hard alloy cutters increased by 19%, twist drills increased by 175%, medicinal water cutters increased by 63%, and taps increased by 375%. These four categories of cutting tools accounted for a waste of 13,574 yuan. Particularly serious is the upward trend in tool consumption each month. For example, the Standard Parts Workshop consumed 82 hard alloy cutters in December last year, 136 in January this year, 157 in February, and rose to 255 in March. That is, consumption increased twofold in four months.

Due to poor planning, inefficient scheduling, and a lack of awareness of the circulation of work-in-progress and semi-finished products during the production process, waste phenomena such as overproducing parts, losing parts, and damaging parts are also very common.

Enterprise management expenses exceeded the budget by more than 70,000 yuan in the first quarter, and workshop expenses exceeded the budget by more than 190,000 yuan.

The main reason for the serious waste is the erroneous thinking among leading staff, technical personnel, and management personnel of "only caring about production, not about costs." The main task of the leading staff of state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises is to ensure the comprehensive fulfillment and over-fulfillment of state plans. However, the director of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant is busy all day with the completion of output and output value plans, rarely paying attention to the use of materials. When tasks are urgent, he does not care whether the material supply plan proposed by the workshop exceeds the quota, always "responding to every request," believing that as long as the production task can be completed, that's all that matters. When the material supply department disagrees with using methods that exceed the consumption quota of raw materials, the director says: "Complete the 'task' first!" The first time it's like this, the second time it's like this, and the third time it's still like this. As the saying goes: "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beams will be crooked." Some workshop leaders only care about completing output and quality tasks and turn a blind eye to the massive waste of materials and tools. For example, the director of the Foundry Workshop said at a meeting: "As long as we guarantee improved quality and complete the task, wasting a little material doesn't matter." When casting castings in this workshop, no one seriously calculates the amount of molten iron needed. The amount requested by the work section is already too much, but the technical group adds some so-called "insurance coefficient" during the review. As a result, 11.5% of the molten cast iron was wasted in the first quarter of this year, and 50% of the molten nodular cast iron was also wasted. Even more seriously, some workshop leaders are afraid that the shortcomings and mistakes of their workshops will be exposed. They not only do not rely on the masses to fight against acts of wasting state property but instead treat those workers who cherish state property and dare to fight against wasteful behavior with an erroneous attitude. For example, the director of the Forging and Riveting Workshop and the chairman of the trade union have done this before. When the Niu Ming group of the large furnace work section was forging crankshaft parts, the plan was for 24 pieces, but they actually made 57 pieces, of which 33 were defective. However, the group and the work section only reported 16 defective pieces and secretly threw away the remaining defective pieces. Zhang Yi, the workshop material clerk, found these defective pieces and reported them to the workshop director, but the workshop director ignored them. Zhang Yi then wrote an article criticizing the workshop director on the blackboard newspaper. After the criticism was published, the workshop director remained indifferent. Because the Niu Ming group produced defective products, they stole materials from other work sections and groups in the workshop to make up for the losses, even passing off nickel-chromium steel as alloy steel and handing it over to the warehouse. Zhang Yi reported this situation to the workshop director and requested action, but the workshop director still ignored it. Zhang Yi then wrote a critical article titled "Shameful Behavior," preparing to publish it on the workshop blackboard newspaper, but the chairman of the workshop trade union did not allow it to be published on the "grounds" that the title of the article was inappropriate. As a result, the waste phenomenon in this workshop became even more serious.

The director and some workshop leaders, using the excuse of "delaying production, you are responsible," demanded that the supply department not interfere with material consumption. The supply department lacked a strong fighting spirit and actually compromised with acts of wasting state property. In addition, the supply department's lax management of materials caused the workshop to accumulate a large amount of surplus materials and waste materials for a long time, which opened the door to arbitrary waste of materials.

Some technical personnel believe that what they are doing is technical work, and waste has nothing to do with them, so they ignore the economic effect when dealing with technical issues. Sometimes, technical personnel are self-righteous, which also causes waste. For example, in the design of the bulldozer shovel component, it was originally stipulated to survey and map according to the Soviet bulldozer sample, but the person in charge of surveying and mapping felt that the Soviet bulldozer's shovel component was not advanced and changed it to be more "advanced." As a result, two reworkings occurred in production, delaying the trial production progress of the new product. The first reworking in February alone wasted 810 man-hours and lost 1,125 kilograms of steel plates.

For a long time, the factory's Party Committee has not struggled against the administrative leaders' disregard for saving in thought and action. The Party organizations in the workshops do not pay attention to the opinions raised by the masses regarding saving, lack effective supervision of the administrative leadership work of the workshops, and do not conduct regular education on saving for the workers.

All these shortcomings and mistakes were criticized at this meeting of Party activists.

In order to overcome waste with collective strength, after the meeting of Party activists, the Party Committee and administrative leaders, based on the facts that have been revealed, designated professionals to study them and formulated concrete conservation plans. The conservation plan has been discussed at the workers' representative assembly convened on June 10th and has been implemented since that day. This plan stipulates that the surplus materials and tools scattered in various workshops, work sections, and groups must be cleared and concentrated for safekeeping; at the same time, it stipulates that the quota management of raw materials and tools should be strengthened, and the management system and requisition system of raw materials and tools should be strictly implemented; it also stipulates that workers should be educated to conscientiously implement operating procedures and abide by labor discipline. Now, the materials and tools scattered in various places have been cleared, and the phenomenon of waste has begun to decrease. However, in order to turn saving work into a regular system that everyone consciously implements, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant must carry out more work in terms of organization, system, and thought.

    太原矿山机器厂开展了反对浪费的斗争
    李谦生
    五月二十日，中共太原矿山机器厂党委会召开了一次党的活动分子会议。会上，揭发了许多严重的浪费现象。会后，太原矿山机器厂制定了节约方案，采取一系列的具体措施来克服浪费。
    太原矿山机器厂的严重的浪费现象有哪些呢？首先是金属材料的利用系数过低。第一季度全厂金属材料利用系数还不到百分之七十，其中球墨铸铁的利用系数只有百分之二十二。这就是说，每投一百吨球墨铸铁只能铸出二十二吨合格铸件。根据重点检查用料情况的计算，第一季度十八种产品所用的金属材料，超过计划百分之三十一，即多用一百九十九吨。
    因质量低、废品多所造成的浪费也是相当严重的。今年第一季的废品损失达六万二千三百五十三元，相当于去年半年的废品损失。
    由于技术准备工作做得不好，生产不均衡，使得停工待料等非生产时间增多。以一月份的非生产时间为一百，则二月份为一百零七点五，三月份为一百三十。全季非生产时间共三万二千四百二十五工时，占实作工时总数的百分之五点八六。以每工时的最低平均产值计算，就少给国家生产十二万九千七百元的财富。
    刀具的消耗也在逐月增加。以今年第一季实际耗用量同去年第四季的实际耗用量作比较：硬质合金刀增加百分之十九，麻花钻增加百分之一百七十五，药水刀增加百分之六十三，公丝增加百分之三百七十五。这四项刀具共浪费了一万三千五百七十四元。尤其严重的是刀具消耗的趋势是逐月上升的。如标准件车间去年十二月份耗用硬质合金刀八十二把，今年一月份为一百三十六把，二月份为一百五十七把，三月份上升到二百五十五把，即在四个月中，消耗量增加二倍。
    由于计划不周、调度不灵以及对生产过程中的在制品、半成品流转情况掌握不住，多作零件、丢失和损坏零件等的浪费现象，也是很普遍的。
    第一季度企业管理费超支七万多元，车间经费超支十九万多元。
    造成严重浪费的原因，主要是领导工作人员、技术人员和管理人员有“只管生产，不问成本”的错误思想。国营、地方国营、公私合营企业的领导工作人员的主要任务，就是保证全面完成和超额完成国家计划。但是太原矿山机器厂厂长整日忙于产量、产值计划的完成，很少过问材料的使用情况。在任务紧急时，更不管车间提出的材料供应计划是否超过定额，总是“有求必应”，认为只要能完成生产任务就行。材料供应部门不同意用超过原材料的消耗定额的办法时，厂长就说：“先完成‘任务’再说！”第一次这样，第二次也是这样，第三次还是这样。俗话说：“上梁不正下梁歪。”有的车间领导人员，也只顾完成产量和质量任务，对材料、工具的大量浪费熟视无睹。如熔铸车间主任在一次会上说：“只要保证提高质量，完成任务，浪费一点材料没有关系”。这个车间在浇铸铸件时，没有人去认真核算需要的铁水数量。工段提出的需要量已经多了，但技术组审核时又要加一些所谓
  “保险系数”。结果，今年第一季度有百分之十一点五的铸铁铁水给浪费了，百分之五十的球墨铸铁铁水也给浪费了。更严重的是有些车间的领导工作人员，害怕自己车间的缺点和错误被揭发，他们不但不依靠群众向浪费国家资财的行为进行斗争，反而以错误的态度来对待那些爱护国家财产、勇于向浪费行为进行斗争的职工。如锻铆车间主任和工会主席就曾经这样做过。这个车间大炉工段牛明小组在锻造曲拐轴零件时，计划是二十四件，实际上作了五十七件，其中有三十三件是废品。但是，小组和工段只报了十六件废品，偷偷地把其余的废品扔了。车间材料员张毅把这些废品找了回来，并向车间主任报告，车间主任却置之不理。张毅又写了一篇稿子在黑板报上批评车间主任。批评稿登出后，车间主任仍然无动于衷。牛明小组因为出了废品，就在车间里偷其他工段、小组的材料来弥补损失，甚至把镍铬钢充作合金钢交了库。张毅又把这个情况向车间主任报告，并要求处理，但车间主任仍然置之不理。张毅又以“可耻的行为”为题，写了一篇批评稿子，准备在车间黑板报上发表，车间工会主席则以这篇稿子的标题不合适为“理由”，不给刊登。这样，这个车间的浪费现象就更加严重。
    厂长和一部分车间领导人员以“耽误生产，你们负责”为借口，要求供应科不要过问材料的消耗情况。供应科缺乏坚强的战斗精神，竟向浪费国家资财的行为妥协。加以供应科对材料的保管不严，使车间长期积存大量余料和废料，这就给任意浪费材料的人大开方便之门。
    部分技术人员认为自己作的是技术工作，浪费跟自己无关，所以在处理技术问题时就忽视经济效果。有时候，技术人员自以为是，也造成浪费。例如推土机铲斗部件的设计，本来规定按照苏联的推土机实样测绘，但负责测绘的人，却自以为苏联推土机的铲斗部件并不先进，把它改的更“先进”些。结果造成生产中的两次返工，延误了新产品试制进度，仅二月份第一次返工就浪费工时八一○点钟，损失钢板一千一百二十五公斤。
    工厂的党委会长期以来，没有对行政领导人员忽视节约的思想和行为进行斗争。车间的党组织不重视群众提出的有关节约的意见，对车间的行政领导工作缺乏有效的监督，对职工没有经常进行节约的教育。
    所有这些缺点和错误，在这一次党的活动分子会议上都受到了批评。
    为了用集体的力量来克服浪费，党的活动分子会议以后，党委和行政的领导人员根据已揭发出来的事实，指定专业人员加以研究，并制定出具体的节约方案来。节约方案已经在六月十日召开的职工代表大会上讨论过，并从这一天起开始执行。这个方案规定，要把散在各车间、工段、小组中的多余材料、工具加以清理，集中保管；同时规定加强原材料和工具的定额管理，严格执行原材料和工具的管理制度和领用制度；也规定了对职工进行必须贯彻操作规程和遵守劳动纪律的教育。现在，分散在各处的材料和工具已经清理好，浪费的现象已经开始减少。但是，要把节约工作变成一个经常性的人人都要自觉执行的制度，太原矿山机器厂还必须从组织方面、制度方面和思想方面进行更多的工作。
