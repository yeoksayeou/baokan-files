    Artistic and Friendly Exchange
    —A Record of the Joyful Gathering of Chinese and Indian Artists
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
    "There is an old Chinese saying: 'Isn't it a joy to have friends coming from afar?' Facing friends from afar, the joy in our hearts cannot be expressed in words," Chinese veteran dramatist Ouyang Yuqian said loudly in his welcoming speech to the Indian artists headed by Mrs. Anil Kumar Chanda.
    "The Chinese people love friends most and respect friendship. Friends who have been friends for generations are called 'sworn friends.' Indian friends are the 'sworn friends' of the Chinese people. For thousands of years, our friendship has continued century after century and has become increasingly profound. This is rare in human history.
    Indian culture has a long and excellent tradition. Whether it is music, dance, sculpture, painting, literature... we all love it very much and introduced it to China very early. Today, our Indian friends have come here, and we want to talk freely like a family, like in a studio and rehearsal room, without any restraint."
    In an elegant room hanging with Qi Baishi's large peony painting, Mrs. Chanda, a famous Indian painter, was cordially talking with Chinese artists Jiang Feng and Wang Chaowen. Mrs. Chanda greatly appreciated the works of Chinese old painter Qi Baishi. She said that she liked Chinese traditional paintings very much. She said that Indian national painting was interrupted for a period under the long rule of the British in the past, and later, under the efforts of her teacher, Tagore, an excellent Indian national artist, it was restored. In the process of restoration, this Indian art master absorbed some of the techniques of Chinese painting. Therefore, Mrs. Chanda was familiar with Chinese traditional painting very early. She said with a smile: "The first time I took a drawing class, my teacher taught me how to use a Chinese brush." Her conversation aroused great interest among Chinese artists.
    While Indian and Chinese artists were quietly talking and exchanging their artistic views, discussing the general laws and criteria of painting and aesthetics, in a nearby hall, Indian and Chinese drama and dancers were talking about the development history of Indian and Chinese dance. Although the sixty-year-old veteran dramatist Ouyang Yuqian was a little inconvenient in his legs and feet, he was still enthusiastically performing various Chinese classical dance movements for our distinguished guests in the hall. Mr. Krishna Kutty, an Indian dancer, introduced the four schools of Indian dance to Chinese dancers. Ms. Indrani Rahman, a beautiful woman wearing a white sari, performed the basic movements of Bharatanatyam dance. In a short dance, she expressed the prayer of a girl in love with subtle eyes and petal-like fingers:
    "Oh, nightingale, won't you come over? Look at me!"
    Mr. Krishna Kutty used the amazingly precise dance posture of Kathakali dance to depict "sunrise," "sunset," and winding "roads." He said with a smile: "My dance itself is a language, like a book, that can express any emotion." In the crowd, a young Chinese girl shouted loudly: "I saw your performance, I am very happy." Immediately, this sentence was revived in several continuous dance movements. Chinese dancer Jia Zuoguang shouted with a smile: "Our friendship is eternal!" Similarly, the expressive hands and eyes of Indian artists carved the eternity of friendship. Ms. Gul Bardhan, head of the Indian Little Ballet Troupe, and dancers Ru. K. Singha Jit Singh performed puppet dance and Manipuri dance. Chinese dancer Jia Zuoguang and Peking Opera stars Tan Fuying, Qiu Shengrong, and Yun Yanming also performed Chinese folk dances and Peking Opera dance movements.
    In another hall, the sound of the seven-stringed zither rang out. Indian and Chinese instrumentalists gathered here. Chinese performer Guan Pinghu played "Guangling San" on the guqin, Ma Sanyuan played "Fishing Boat Song Evening" on the guzheng, and Li Tingsong played "Xunyang Moon Night" on the pipa. These ancient melodies evoked the heartfelt joy of Indian artists. They also explained in detail to the Chinese performers the playing methods of the Indian classical instruments, the sitar and the sarod.
    Loud singing and bursts of applause continued to rise in another hall. This was Mr. D. V. Paluskar and Mr. V. K. Lokur, Indian classical singers, singing Indian classical songs with national characteristics. Chinese singers Li Bo, Baoyin Gelede, etc. also sang folk songs of various Chinese ethnic groups. In this way, Indian and Chinese artists exchanged the ancient Eastern art with thousands of years of tradition in these short three hours, and also exchanged the friendship of 950 million people contained in the ancient art!

    艺术和友谊的交流
    ——记中印两国艺术家的欢聚
    本报记者　金凤
    “中国有句古话：‘有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎’，面对着远方来的朋友，我们心里的高兴是不能用言语来形容的”，中国老戏剧家欧阳予倩对着以阿尼尔·库玛尔·钱达夫人为首的印度艺术家们高声地致着欢迎辞。
    “中国人民最喜欢朋友，也最尊重友谊。世世代代相交的朋友，我们称为‘世交’。印度朋友是中国人民的‘世交’了。几千年来，我们的友谊一个世纪、一个世纪地延续下来而且日见深厚，这在人类历史上是少见的。
    印度文化有着悠久优良的传统，无论音乐、舞蹈、雕刻、绘画、文学……我们都是非常喜爱，很早介绍到中国来。今天，印度的朋友们来到这里，我们要像一家人一样，像在画室里和排演室里一样，毫无拘束来随便畅谈。”
    在一间悬挂着齐白石的巨幅牡丹画轴的优雅的房间内，印度著名的画家钱达夫人亲切地和中国美术家江丰、王朝闻等在一起交谈着。钱达夫人非常欣赏中国老画家齐白石的作品，她说她很喜欢中国的国画。她说印度民族的绘画在英国过去长期的统治下曾经中断过一个时期，后来在她的老师——印度优秀的民族艺术家泰戈尔的努力下，把它重新恢复了。在恢复的过程中，这位印度的艺术大师曾经吸取了中国绘画的一些技巧。因此钱达夫人很早就熟悉中国的国画。她笑着说：“我第一次上图画课的时候，我的老师就教我使用一枝中国的毛笔。”她的谈话引起中国美术家们浓厚的兴趣。
    当印度和中国的美术家们在静静地畅谈和交换着彼此的艺术见解，探讨着绘画和美学的一般法则和准绳的时候，在旁边的一个大厅里，印度和中国的戏剧、舞蹈家们正在交谈着印度和中国的舞蹈发展史。六十多岁的老戏剧家欧阳予倩尽管腿脚有点不大灵便了，仍然兴致勃勃地在大厅中为我们的贵宾表演着中国的种种古典舞动作。印度舞蹈家克里希纳·库蒂先生给中国的舞蹈家们介绍了印度舞蹈的四个派别。披着白色纱丽的美丽的印德拉尼·拉赫曼女士表演了巴拉达拉蒂亚舞的基本动作。在短短的一节舞蹈中，她用微妙的眼神、花瓣般的手指表达着一个爱恋中的女郎的祈求：
    “呵，夜莺，你不愿意过来吗？向我注视一下吧！”
    克里希纳·库蒂先生用着卡塔卡利舞的惊人的精确的舞姿描绘了“日出”、“日落”和曲曲折折的“道路”。他笑着说：“我的舞蹈本身就是语言，就像一本书，可以把任何感情表达出来。”人丛中，一个年轻的中国女孩子响亮地喊着：“我看到了你们的表演，非常高兴”。立刻，这句话在几个连续的舞蹈动作中复活了。中国舞蹈家贾作光笑着喊：“我们的友谊是永恒的！”同样地，印度艺术家传神的双手和眼睛刻划了友谊的永恒。印度小巴蕾舞剧团团长古尔·巴丹女士和舞蹈家鲁·克·辛加吉特·辛格先生表演了傀儡舞和曼尼普利舞。中国的舞蹈家贾作光和京剧名演员谭富英、裘盛戎、云燕铭也表演了中国的民族舞蹈和京剧的舞蹈动作。
    在另一间大厅里，七弦古琴的丁冬声响起了。这里欢聚着印度和中国的器乐家们。中国的演奏家管平湖用古琴演奏了“广陵散”、马三元用古筝演奏了“渔舟唱晚”、李廷松用琵琶演奏了“浔阳夜月”这些古老的乐曲唤起了印度艺术家衷心的喜悦。他们也详细地给中国的演奏家们解释着印度古典乐器锡达尔和瑟路达的演奏的方法。
    高亢的歌声和一阵阵掌声不断地在另一个厅堂中扬起。这是印度古典歌唱家德·维·帕卢斯卡尔先生和维·克·洛基亚先生在演唱着富有民族风格的印度的古典歌曲。中国歌唱家李波、宝音格力得等也演唱了中国各族的民歌。就这样，印度和中国的艺术家们在这短短的三小时中交流了有着几千年传统的古老的东方的艺术，也交流了古老艺术所蕴含的九亿五千万人民的友谊！
