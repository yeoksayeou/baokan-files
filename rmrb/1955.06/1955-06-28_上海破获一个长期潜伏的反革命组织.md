Shanghai has recently uncovered a remnant counter-revolutionary organization of the "Yiguandao Western Faction Loyalty Hall" that had been lying dormant for a long time and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau has arrested 53 bandits, including Xu Chunzhao, Yan Jiuyun, Zhao Huaidao, and Bai Cuiming, in accordance with the law.

Before liberation, the "Yiguandao Western Faction Loyalty Hall" counter-revolutionary organization was spread across fifteen counties and cities in northern Jiangsu, including Nantong and Rugao, where it frantically engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. After liberation, during the movement to ban reactionary secret societies, the remaining leaders, such as Xu Chunzhao, not only refused to register, but intensified their efforts, continuing to hide in counties such as Dongtai, Dafeng, and Xinghua to carry out counter-revolutionary activities rampantly. Bandit Xu Chunzhao and others held sermons, spread rumors of "changing the heavens," incited people, and disrupted social order. The bandits also used "conducting the Tao" to swindle a large amount of "action fees." Bandit leaders Xu Chunzhao, Yan Jiuyun, and others alone swindled more than 4,000 yuan in "Tao fees" in 1954 alone.

These bandits also adopted various conspiratorial means to infiltrate our health agencies, cooperatives, or state-owned, joint state-private, and private factories to carry out sabotage activities. Yiguandao "point transmitter" Yang Zhenhua, who infiltrated the joint state-private Huatong Switch Factory, pretended to be active and submitted an application to join the Party, attempting to further infiltrate the Party. The activities of these bandits were extremely secretive. Some roamed on the water, while others used selling radishes or opening clothing stores and embroidery shops as cover, constantly engaging in reactionary activities. Bandit Yan Jiuyun, from 1952 to the end of 1954, forged fourteen sets of seals of township and town people's governments, including 56 types of official seals, stamps, and responsible person signature stamps, and forged more than 100 household registration certificates and voter certificates to cover up their counter-revolutionary activities.

After the Shanghai Public Security Bureau discovered clues to these bandits' counter-revolutionary activities, it conducted a long-term investigation, obtained conclusive evidence, and arrested 53 people, including bandit Xu Chunzhao, in April this year in accordance with the law.

    上海破获一个长期潜伏的反革命组织
    上海市公安局最近破获了一个长期潜伏进行反革命活动的“一贯道西派忠义坛”残余反革命组织，依法逮捕了匪徒徐春照、严九云、赵怀道、白翠铭等五十三名。
    “一贯道西派忠义坛”反革命组织，解放以前曾散布在苏北南通、如皋等十五个县市，疯狂地进行反革命活动。解放以后在取缔反动会道门运动中，残余道首徐春照等不仅拒不登记，反而变本加厉，继续隐匿在东台、大丰、兴化等县猖狂地进行反革命活动。徐匪春照等曾经开堂讲道，散布“变天”谣言，煽惑人心，破坏社会秩序。匪徒们又利用“办道”，骗取大量“行动费”，仅匪首徐春照、严九云等四犯，在一九五四年一年就骗取了“道费”四千多元。
    这帮匪徒并采取了各种阴谋手段，混进我卫生机关、合作社或国营、公私合营、私营工厂中，进行阴谋破坏活动。一贯道“点传师”杨振华混进公私合营华通开关厂，就假装积极，并提出入党申请书，企图进一步钻进党内来。这帮匪徒的活动极为诡秘，有的流窜水上，有的以贩卖萝卜或开设成衣店、刺绣店等为掩护，不断从事反动活动。严匪九云从一九五二年起到一九五四年年底止，先后伪造乡、镇人民政府印鉴十四套，包括关防、条戳、负责人签名章等五十六种，又伪造户口证明、选民证等一百多张，借以掩护其反革命活动。
    上海市公安局发现了这帮匪徒进行反革命活动的线索以后，经过长期侦察，获得确凿罪证，在今年四月间依法将徐匪春照等五十三人逮捕。
