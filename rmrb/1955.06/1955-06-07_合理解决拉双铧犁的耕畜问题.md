Rationally Solving the Problem of Draught Animals for Pulling Double-Share Plows
    Gao Maoquan
    Last autumn, the Nanzhai Guan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shecheng Township, Yushe County, Shanxi Province, bought a two-wheeled double-share plow. However, when it came to using it, a problem arose with the animals pulling the plow. Most of the cooperative members' draught animals were donkeys. The two-wheeled double-share plow was too heavy for three donkeys to pull, but four donkeys were too awkward to harness. Dou Fuhu and Meng Fuquan each had an ox that could pull it, but they were both unwilling. Dou Fuhu said, "The new plow is heavy and large. Who will be responsible if the animal gets injured?" Faced with this situation, the cooperative committee had no solution; this plow was "placed under house arrest" after only being tested for half an afternoon. The fate of the two-wheeled double-share plow in the Beizhai Guan Village Agricultural Cooperative was similar. This cooperative decided to have Yang Guiwei's large castrated ox pull the double-share plow, but he wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, saying, "The cooperative has plenty of animals, but they insist on my ox doing the heavy work. If it gets injured, I'll lose everything." As a result, the plow was bought back, but even the straw rope binding it had not been untied. Of the five plows bought by the five cooperatives in Shecheng Township, only the one in Shuangfeng Agricultural Cooperative had plowed fifteen mu of land.

    Can cooperatives without public draught animals use two-wheeled double-share plows? Dazhai Township, which is adjacent to Shecheng Township, has a similar situation in terms of land and animals, but the utilization rate of two-wheeled double-share plows is very high. This spring, seven cooperatives in Dazhai Township used two-wheeled double-share plows to plow 2,200 mu of land, averaging 200 mu per plow. The agricultural cooperatives in Dazhai Township also encountered difficulties with draught animals when they first started using two-wheeled double-share plows. However, under the leadership of the Party branch in Dazhai Township, this problem was resolved relatively smoothly. There are two ways Dazhai Township solved the animal problem: one is that the draught animals pulling the two-wheeled double-share plow are rented by the cooperative after being valued, and the remuneration is appropriately increased. The Xima Village Agricultural Cooperative stipulates that for fixed draught animals pulling the two-wheeled double-share plow, they will give one more sheng of black beans or one jiao of RMB per mu than pulling an ordinary walking plow. The cooperative members are very satisfied with this method. Cooperative members who were originally unwilling to let their animals pull the two-wheeled double-share plow for the cooperative, now voluntarily rent their animals to the cooperative for use. The other way is that cooperatives with better conditions, under the principle of voluntary consent of the animal owner, select two or three draught animals that can pull the two-wheeled double-share plow to join the cooperative after being valued, and use them specifically to pull the two-wheeled double-share plow.

    The situation in Dazhai Township shows that in the process of promoting two-wheeled double-share plows, we must earnestly help agricultural production cooperatives solve specific problems in use in order to truly exert the effectiveness of two-wheeled double-share plows. Otherwise, like in Shecheng Township, the plow is bought but becomes a "sleeping plow," which does not play a role in production and only increases the burden on cooperative members.

    合理解决拉双铧犁的耕畜问题
    高茂泉
    山西省榆社县社城乡南翟管村农业生产合作社去年秋天买了一部双轮双铧犁，可是在使用时，却在拉犁的牲口上发生了问题。社员的耕畜大部分是驴，双轮双铧犁用三个驴拉不动，用四个又转不开套。社员窦福虎和孟富全的两头牛可以拉，可是他们都不愿意。窦福虎说：“新犁又重又大，牲口使坏了算谁的？”眼看着这种情况，社务委员会也没有办法；这部犁只试耕了半个下午就被“软禁”起来了。北翟管村农业合作社的双轮双铧犁的命运也差不多。这个社确定让社员杨贵维的大犍牛拉双铧犁，他就要出社，他说：“社里牲口挺多，偏让我的牛扛重活，如果使坏了，我的家业就光了。”结果，犁买回来后连捆犁的草绳都没有解开过。社城乡五个社买回五部犁，只有双峰农业合作社的一部耕过十五亩地。
    没有公共耕畜的社能不能使用双轮双铧犁呢？同社城乡紧邻的大寨乡，土地、牲口情况和社城乡差不多，双轮双铧犁的使用率却很高。今年春季大寨乡有七个社用双轮双铧犁耕了二千二百亩地，每部犁平均耕了二百亩。大寨乡的农业合作社在开始使用双轮双铧犁时，也曾遇到过耕畜的困难。但是，在大寨乡的党支部的领导下，比较顺利地解决了这个问题。大寨乡解决牲口问题的办法有两种：一种是：拉双轮双铧犁的耕畜作价后由社租用，并适当地提高报酬。西马村农业合作社规定：用固定的耕畜拉双轮双铧犁，每耕一亩比拉一般步犁多给一升黑豆或一角人民币的租金。社员对这个办法很满意，原来不愿把牲口给社里拉双轮双铧犁的社员，又自动把牲口租给社里使用。另一种是：条件比较好的社，在畜主自愿的原则下，挑选能拉双轮双铧犁的两三头耕畜作价入社，专门用来拉双轮双铧犁。
    大寨乡的情况说明在推广双轮双铧犁的过程中，必须认真帮助农业生产合作社解决使用中的具体问题，才能真正发挥双轮双铧犁的效用。否则，像社城乡那样，犁买来了，却变成了“睡犁”，在生产上不起作用，徒然增加了社员的负担。
