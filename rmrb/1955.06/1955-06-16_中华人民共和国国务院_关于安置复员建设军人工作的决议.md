Since 1950, our People's Armed Forces have begun planned reorganization and demobilization work. In the future, with the implementation of the compulsory military service system, a large number of new recruits will join the army every year, and a large number of military personnel will also be demobilized and return to their hometowns every year. Demobilized and transferred military personnel generally have a high level of socialist consciousness and strong organizational discipline. Many demobilized and transferred military personnel have undergone long-term revolutionary war training and testing, and a large portion have been incorporated into the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army. Properly resettling them, ensuring that they are all properly placed, and allowing them to play an active role in various jobs and on production fronts is a long-term and important national policy, and also a regular and glorious political task for governments at all levels and the entire population. The work of resettling demobilized and transferred military personnel is closely related to national economic construction and national defense construction. Failure to do this work well will have a very unfavorable impact on promoting the compulsory military service system, strengthening national defense capabilities, and safeguarding socialist construction. People's governments at all levels must pay great attention to this work; it is extremely wrong to treat it as a secondary task and fail to give it full attention.

In the past few years, all localities have generally attached importance to the work of resettling demobilized and transferred military personnel. The vast majority of demobilized and transferred military personnel in the past have been appropriately resettled. They have participated in industrial and agricultural production and other work, and many have become active and model workers in production or work. However, there are still serious problems and shortcomings in this work. All localities have some demobilized and transferred military personnel who have not yet been resettled or have not been resettled properly. Some demobilized and transferred military personnel originally joined the army from rural areas, but now possess specialized skills and should be assigned appropriate work based on their own conditions. However, some localities mechanically implement the principle of "resettlement in the place of origin" when resettling these demobilized and transferred military personnel, forcing them to engage in agricultural production, without appropriately solving their employment problems based on different individuals. Some factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and organizations unilaterally emphasize that demobilized and transferred military personnel are "unfamiliar with the business" or even mistakenly believe that they "like to make suggestions" and are "difficult to lead," refusing or disguisedly refusing to employ them, or after employing them, failing to enthusiastically help them become familiar with the business and achieve results, and some even adopt bad attitudes such as discrimination, exclusion, difficulty, and attacks. Some factories and mines refuse to reinstate demobilized and transferred military personnel who originally joined the army from their units, and some schools refuse to allow demobilized and transferred military personnel who originally joined the army from their schools to return to school. Some localities have not seriously solved the difficulties of demobilized and transferred military personnel in production, life, and medical treatment. This makes some demobilized and transferred military personnel feel uneasy, complain about the government, and run around looking for work and a way out, which has a very bad impact. Although these serious phenomena are not very common, they must not be allowed to continue.

In order to further properly resettle demobilized and transferred military personnel, the following resolution is made:

(1) Resettling demobilized and transferred military personnel is an unshirkable responsibility of all central departments and local government agencies at all levels, people's organizations, and various enterprises and institutions. When transferring cadres, allocating labor, and recruiting workers, apprentices, staff, and technical personnel, all units should regard demobilized and transferred military personnel as the first priority for employment.

For employees who joined the army from factories, mines, and other enterprises and institutions, whether the original unit is state-owned or private, their work should be restored. If the original unit cannot absorb them due to staffing limitations, they should also be included in the out-of-staff employee balanced allocation plan for training or transfer to other units in the system for employment. For former employees of private enterprises that have now closed down or been reorganized, their work should be arranged by the agency in charge of the industry in accordance with the principle of "industry alignment."

For students who joined the army from secondary or higher schools, the original school should allow them to return to school, or the local education department should introduce them to other appropriate schools to return to school.

When state-owned factories, mines, and other enterprise departments train personnel for newly built and expanded factories and mines, they should regard demobilized and transferred military personnel with appropriate conditions as the target of training, in order to solve the career problems of demobilized and transferred military personnel and enhance the backbone force of future newly built and expanded production units.

The Ministries of Industry, Railways, Transportation, Agriculture, Forestry, Water Resources, Posts and Telecommunications, Geology, Commerce, Trade, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives should plan to absorb a group of demobilized and transferred military personnel to participate in work when building and expanding larger enterprises such as factories, mines, railways, highways, farms, cooperatives, and postal and telecommunications facilities. In the future, when sending off demobilized and transferred military personnel, the Ministry of National Defense should review them and separately organize a collective transfer for personnel who live in cities, had no fixed occupation before joining the army, have real difficulties in resettlement after returning to the city, and personnel who live in rural areas but are not suitable for resettlement in rural areas, to participate in the newly built or expanded enterprises of the above-mentioned relevant departments. The above-mentioned departments should submit their annual personnel plans to the Ministry of Labor for summary and transfer to the Ministry of National Defense for unified allocation and sending.

When labor departments and planning departments allocate personnel to newly built and expanded factories and mines, they should give priority to allocating demobilized and transferred military personnel, and place demobilized and transferred military personnel first in the labor allocation plan. When personnel departments of governments at all levels allocate staff, they should include demobilized and transferred military personnel who meet the conditions for cadres in the allocation plan and assign them appropriate work as appropriate. The relevant central departments should formulate specific implementation measures for resettling demobilized and transferred military personnel in their respective systems.

When allocating work and determining salary and benefits for demobilized and transferred military personnel participating in the work of agencies and organizations, appropriate consideration should be given to their original rank in the army, their military service should be counted as the history of participating in work, and they should enjoy the welfare benefits of the agency like ordinary staff. For demobilized and transferred military personnel participating in the work of factories, mines, and other enterprise departments, their military service should be counted as working years and enjoy labor insurance benefits, and they shall not be dismissed without cause.

The provincial and municipal people's committees and relevant central departments are responsible for conducting an inspection of the employment, training, and use of demobilized and transferred military personnel in their respective regions and units. Units that adopt wrong attitudes such as refusing to employ, discriminating, excluding, making things difficult, and attacking demobilized and transferred military personnel should be severely criticized, and those with serious circumstances should be punished.

(2) Demobilized and transferred military personnel who originally joined the army from rural areas should still return to rural areas to participate in agricultural production if they do not have specialized skills. For demobilized and transferred military personnel who return to rural production, they should be effectively helped to solve the difficulties of having no or lacking land, housing, and other problems, mobilize and organize them to participate in agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperative organizations, help them formulate production plans, educate them to use production subsidies for production, and promptly help them overcome difficulties in production and life, so that they can play an active role in agricultural production. In order to be able to actively solve the difficulties of having no or lacking land, housing, and other problems for demobilized and transferred military personnel resettled in rural areas, all localities should conduct a serious investigation and registration of rural public property in advance.

Appropriate consideration should be given to the supply of grain (especially refined grain) and oil to disabled veterans of the second class or above and patients with serious chronic diseases among demobilized and transferred military personnel who return to rural areas.

For those who have already been demobilized or are about to be demobilized to rural areas, but who do have a considerable level of education or specialized skills and are not suitable for agricultural production, the local county people's committee should classify and register them, and try to solve their employment problems locally. If it is impossible to solve them within the county, they can report to the provincial people's committee for unified allocation and solution. Any practice of mechanically implementing "resettlement in the place of origin" regardless of the actual situation or using "resettlement in the place of origin" as an excuse to push things away must be corrected.

(3) For demobilized and transferred military personnel who cannot engage in agricultural production and have no employment conditions in other aspects, the civil affairs departments should, with the assistance of relevant departments, organize them to engage in appropriate production based on their conditions and local conditions. For demobilized and transferred military personnel who are old, weak, chronically ill, have lost their labor ability, and have no one to support them, the civil affairs departments should send them to revolutionary disabled veterans' sanatoriums or poor people's production sanatoriums for accommodation and education. For demobilized and transferred military personnel who return home with illness and need treatment, the local health departments should give them priority treatment, and should be effectively responsible for treating relapsed wounds. For demobilized and transferred military personnel suffering from mental illness who need treatment, the local health departments should be responsible for accommodation and treatment, and the civil affairs departments should be responsible for the supply of living expenses.

(4) There are many problems in the family marriages of demobilized and transferred military personnel, and some have even caused suicide and homicide incidents as a result. People's committees in various localities should conduct inspections and handle them with a serious attitude. For general marriage problems, they should be resolved as much as possible by means of persuasion and education. Those who repeatedly fail to change their behavior in destroying the family marriage relationship of demobilized and transferred military personnel and those who use their powers to attack and frame demobilized and transferred military personnel must be punished according to law. Problems existing in the marriages of demobilized and transferred military personnel who are about to return home should be inspected and handled in advance to effectively prevent problems from occurring.

(5) Local people's committees at all levels, especially the people's committees of large and medium-sized cities, should instruct the local transfer construction committees and civil affairs departments to conduct an in-depth understanding of the demobilized and transferred military personnel who have not yet been resettled, classify and register them, and put forward specific opinions on resettling them. Then, the government-responsible cadres will convene responsible persons from relevant departments to discuss together, seek a unified understanding, and make unified arrangements. All localities must also prepare for receiving and resettling new demobilized and transferred military personnel. After the demobilized and transferred military personnel arrive, they should be warmly welcomed and entertained, their situation should be carefully understood, they should be properly resettled separately, and they should be informed in detail about the local production, living, and working conditions, and they should be encouraged to actively participate in production and work.

(6) In order to promptly solve the problems existing in the production, life, and work of demobilized and transferred military personnel, after each batch of demobilized and transferred military personnel is settled down, the civil affairs departments in various localities must organize forces to conduct a general inspection, and promptly solve the problems of improper resettlement and their problems in production and life. At the same time, the handling of letters and visits from demobilized and transferred military personnel should also be strengthened. Personnel handling letters and visits must have patience and an attitude of warmly caring for demobilized and transferred military personnel, specifically solve the problems they raise, and must not shirk their responsibilities. Major issues raised in their letters and visits should be thoroughly investigated and resolved in the spirit of being responsible to the end.

(7) Demobilized and transferred military personnel should accept the allocation of the organization, settle down in their production or work posts, and maintain and carry forward the glorious traditions of the People's Army in production and work, abide by government laws and labor discipline, and play an active leading role. Before demobilized and transferred military personnel leave the army, the political organs of the army should conduct sufficient political work to clearly explain these principles to them. Local civil affairs departments should understand their work, study, and production through holding meetings of representatives of demobilized and transferred military personnel or forums, help them solve difficult problems, solicit their opinions, listen to their criticisms, strengthen their political and ideological education, and mobilize them to criticize and self-criticize those who are uneasy about agricultural production or are unwilling to leave the city, unwilling to work in difficult areas, and excessively picky about work, meritorious service and arrogance, and correct them. Local civil affairs departments should also pay attention to cultivating model figures of demobilized and transferred military personnel in production and work to establish flags, and widely publicize their model deeds in newspapers and magazines.

(8) Supervisory departments at all levels should inspect dereliction of duty and illegal events in the work of resettling demobilized and transferred military personnel by local governments at all levels and deal with them seriously. Agencies or individuals who are conscientious and responsible for this work and have achieved remarkable results should be appropriately rewarded.

(9) People's committees at all levels must strengthen the organizational leadership of the work of receiving and resettling demobilized and transferred military personnel. The offices of the transfer construction committees of provinces, cities, and counties should become regular offices and work jointly with the civil affairs departments. The transfer construction committee should designate a responsible cadre to specifically lead the work of the office. The office structure should not be weakened if it is already sound. Places where the office structure has not yet been established should be established and improved quickly, especially the demobilization and transfer office structure of counties and cities must be strengthened. The cadres required by the office structure shall be transferred by the local people's committee from relevant departments, and personnel may be transferred from relevant departments at any time to help work when there are temporary major tasks. The transfer construction committees at all levels should establish a regular meeting system to study and solve problems existing in the resettlement work in a timely manner.

It is required that all localities basically settle down the soldiers demobilized this year before October, and earnestly solve the outstanding problems in the past. Before the end of October, all provinces and cities should make a special summary of the work of resettling demobilized and transferred military personnel and report it to the Central Transfer Construction Committee and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

    中华人民共和国国务院
    关于安置复员建设军人工作的决议
    （一九五五年五月三十一日国务院全体会议第十次会议通过）
    我国人民武装部队自一九五○年起就开始了有计划的整编复员工作，今后由于义务兵役制度的实行，每年都将有大批新兵入伍，同时每年也都将有大批的军人复员回乡。复员建设军人一般都有较高的社会主义觉悟和坚强的组织性、纪律性；许多复员建设军人都经过了长期革命战争的锻炼和考验，并有很大一部分编入了人民解放军的预备役。妥善地安置他们，使他们各得其所，在各个工作岗位和生产战线上发挥积极作用，这是国家的一项长期的重要政策，也是各级政府和全体人民群众的一项经常的光荣的政治任务。安置复员建设军人的工作同国家的经济建设和国防建设密切相关，做不好这项工作，就会对推行义务兵役制度，加强国防力量和保卫社会主义建设发生很不利的影响。各级人民政府对于这一工作必须予以极大的注意；把它作为次要工作而不加以充分的重视，是极端错误的。
    几年来各地对安置复员建设军人的工作一般是重视的，过去的复员建设军人绝大多数已经得到了适当安置，他们参加了工农业生产和其他工作，并且有许多人已经成为生产上或工作上的积极分子和模范人物。但是，这项工作中还存在着严重的问题和缺点。各地都或多或少有一些复员建设军人至今还没有得到安置或者安置得不够妥善。有些复员建设军人虽然原来是在农村参军的，但现在具有专门技术，应当根据他们本身的条件给他们分配以适当的工作；而有些地方在安置这些复员建设军人时，机械执行“原籍安置”的原则，硬要他们从事农业生产，没有根据不同对象，适当地解决他们的就业问题。有些厂矿企业、机关、团体片面强调复员建设军人“业务生疏”、甚至错误地认为他们“爱提意见”、“不好领导”等等，拒绝或者变相拒绝录用他们，或者在录用以后不去热情地帮助他们熟悉业务，作出成绩，有的甚至对他们采取歧视、排斥、刁难、打击等恶劣态度。有的厂矿企业拒绝原来从本单位参军的复员建设军人复业，有的学校拒绝原来从本校参军的复员建设军人复学。有些地方对于复员建设军人的生产、生活和疾病医疗上的困难没有认真地予以解决。这样就使有些复员建设军人情绪不安，埋怨政府，为寻找工作和生活出路到处奔波，影响很坏。以上这些严重现象虽然不是很普遍的，但决不能容许其继续存在。
    为了进一步妥善安置复员建设军人，特作如下决议：
    （一）安置复员建设军人是中央各部门和各级地方政府机关、人民团体以及各种企业、事业单位的一种不容推卸的责任，各单位在调用干部、调配劳力和招收工人、学徒、职员、技术人员时，都应当把复员建设军人作为第一位录用的对象。
    凡是从工厂、矿山及其他企业、事业单位参军的职工，原单位不论是公营或私营，均应恢复其工作，如果原单位因为编制所限不能吸收时，也应当将他们列入编外职工的平衡调配计划之内，加以培训或调入本系统其他单位就业。对原是私营企业职工现在该企业已经停业或改组的，应当按照“行业归口”的原则，由主管该行业的机关安置他们的工作。
    对原从中等以上学校参军的学生，原学校应当准其复学，或由当地教育部门介绍入其他适当学校复学。
    各国营厂矿等企业部门在为新建、扩建厂矿培训人员时，应当将条件适当的复员建设军人作为培训的对象，以解决复员建设军人的职业问题和增强将来新建、扩建生产单位的骨干力量。
    工业、铁道、交通、农业、林业、水利、邮电、地质、商业、贸易等部和全国合作总社，在新建扩建厂矿、铁路、公路、农场、合作、邮电等较大企业的时候，应当有计划地吸收一批复员建设军人参加工作。今后遣送复员建设军人的时候，国防部应当对他们加以审查，把家居城市、参军前无固定职业、回城市后安置确有困难的人员以及家居农村但不适于在农村安置的人员，另行组织集体转业，参加到上述各有关部门的新建或扩建的企业中去。上述部门应当每年将用人计划送交劳动部汇总转送国防部，以便统一调配遣送。
    劳动部门和计划部门在给新建、扩建的厂矿企业调配人员时，应当优先调配复员建设军人，并在劳动力调配计划中，把复员建设军人放在第一位。各级政府的人事部门在调配工作人员时，应当把合于干部条件的复员建设军人列在调配计划之内，酌情分配以适当的工作。中央各有关部门应当制定本系统安置复员建设军人的具体实施办法。
    对参加机关、团体工作的复员建设军人，在分配工作、确定薪金待遇时应适当照顾到他们原在部队的级别，其军龄应当算做参加工作的历史，同一般工作人员一样享受本机关的福利待遇。对参加厂矿等企业部门工作的复员建设军人，其军龄应当算做工龄享受劳保待遇，并且不得无故解雇。
    责成各省、市人民委员会和中央各有关部门对所属地区和本系统各单位录用和培养使用复员建设军人的情况进行一次检查。对于那些对复员建设军人采取拒绝录用、歧视、排斥、刁难、打击等错误态度的单位，应该予以严厉的批评，情节严重的，应当予以处分。
    （二）对原由农村参军的复员建设军人如无专门技术，仍然应当全部回到农村参加农业生产。对于回到农村生产的复员建设军人，应当切实帮助他们解决没有或缺乏土地、房屋等困难问题，动员和组织他们参加农业生产和互助合作组织，帮助他们订立生产计划，教育他们将生产资助金用于生产，并及时帮助他们克服生产、生活上的困难，使他们在农业生产中发挥积极作用。为了能够主动地为安置在农村中的复员建设军人解决没有或缺乏土地、房屋等困难问题，各地应当对农村的公有财产预先加以认真的调查登记。
    对于回到农村的复员建设军人中的二等以上残废和重慢性病员，在粮食（特别是细粮）和油类的供应上，应当给予适当的照顾。
    对于已经和即将复员到农村，但确实具有相当文化水平或专门技术又不适合从事农业生产的，当地县人民委员会应当加以分类登记，尽量就地解决他们的工作问题。如在本县范围内确实无法解决时，可报请省人民委员会设法统一调配解决。任何不顾实际情况机械执行“原籍安置”或借口“原籍安置”而推出了事的做法，必须纠正。
      （三）对于既不能从事农业生产、又没有在其他方面就业条件的复员建设军人，民政部门应当在有关部门协助下，根据他们的条件和本地情况组织他们从事适当的生产。对于年老体弱、长期患病、丧失劳动力而又无人赡养的复员建设军人，应由民政部门送革命残废军人教养院或贫民生产教养院加以收容教养。对带病还乡和患病需要治疗的复员建设军人，当地卫生部门应当优先予以治疗，对伤口复发的，应当切实负责医治。对患有精神病需要治疗的复员建设军人，应当由当地卫生部门负责收容治疗，生活供应由民政部门负责。
      （四）复员建设军人在家庭婚姻上存在不少问题，有些甚至因此造成自杀被杀事件，各地人民委员会应当以严肃的态度进行检查处理。对一般性的婚姻问题要尽可能地用说服教育的方法加以解决，对破坏复员建设军人家庭婚姻关系屡教不改、和利
  用职权打击陷害复员建设军人的分子必须依法惩办。对将要回乡的复员建设军人在婚姻上存在的问题，要预先检查处理，切实防止发生问题。
      （五）地方各级人民委员会，特别是各大中城市的人民委员会应当责成当地转业建设委员会和民政部门对目前尚未安置的复员建设军人进行深入的了解，加以分类登记，提出安置他们的具体意见，然后由政府负责干部召集各有关部门负责人员共同讨论，求得一致认识，进行统一安排。各地还必须为接收安置新的复员建设军人作好准备工作。在复员建设军人到达以后，应热情地欢迎和招待他们，仔细地了解他们的情况，分别加以适当安置，并向他们详细介绍当地的生产、生活和工作情况，鼓励他们积极参加生产和工作。
      （六）为了及时解决复员建设军人生产、生活和工作中存在的问题，各地民政部门在每一批复员建设军人安置下去以后，必须组织力量，进行一次普遍检查，对安置不当和他们在生产、生活中存在的问题，及时加以解决。同时，对复员建设军人来信来访的处理工作也应当予以加强。处理来信来访工作的人员，必须具有耐心和热情关怀复员建设军人的态度，具体解决他们提出的问题，不得推诿。对他们来信来访中提出的重大问题，应当本着负责到底的精神，深入检查，给予彻底的解决。
    （七）复员建设军人应当接受组织的分配，安心于自己的生产或工作岗位，并在生产和工作中保持和发扬人民军队的光荣传统，遵守政府法令和劳动纪律，发挥积极带头作用。军队政治机关在复员建设军人离开军队以前，应该进行充分的政治工作，向他们切实说明这些道理。各地民政部门应当通过召开复员建设军人代表会或座谈会等形式，了解他们工作、学习、生产等方面的情况，帮助他们解决困难问题；征求他们的意见，听取他们的批评；加强对他们的政治思想教育工作，发动他们对那种不安于农业生产，或者不愿离开城市、不愿到艰苦地区工作和过分挑剔工作、居功骄傲等错误思想，开展批评和自我批评，加以纠正。各地民政部门还应当注意培养复员建设军人在生产和工作中的模范人物，以树立旗帜，并在报章杂志上广泛宣传他们的模范事迹。
      （八）各级监察部门应当对地方各级政府在安置复员建设军人工作上的失职违法事件进行检查，并加以严肃处理。凡对这项工作认真负责、成绩显著的机关或个人应当予以适当奖励。
    （九）各地人民委员会必须加强对接收安置复员建设军人工作的组织领导，各省、市、县的转业建设委员会办公室，应当成为经常的办公机构，同民政部门合署办公。转业建设委员会应指定一负责干部具体领导办公室的工作。办公机构已经健全的不应削弱，尚未建立健全的地方，应当很快建立健全起来，特别是县市的复员转业办公机构必须加强。办公机构所需要的干部由当地人民委员会从各有关部门抽调，遇有临时重大任务时，并可以从各有关部门随时抽调人员，帮助工作。各级转业建设委员会应当建立定期的会议制度，及时研究解决安置工作中存在的问题。
    对今年复员的军人要求各地在十月份以前基本上安置下去，并认真解决以往的遗留问题，十月底以前各省、市应将安置复员建设军人的工作作出专题总结，报告中央转业建设委员会和内务部。
