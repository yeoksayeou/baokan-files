Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, June 14th: According to the Yugoslav News Agency Belgrade, "Borba" emphasized in a commentary on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations on the 14th, that more favorable conditions have now emerged to strengthen the development and role of the United Nations organization in international relations.

"Borba" then traced the joint declaration of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and wrote: As long as the United Nations is not a truly universal world organization in its structure, it cannot fully accomplish its tasks. This means that the issue of allowing new member states to join the United Nations – which has always been a very important task – has now become even more important and urgent. The People's Republic of China and all other countries that meet the conditions of the UN Charter should be allowed to enter this organization.

"Borba" concluded: The improvement of the composition of the United Nations will have an important and positive impact on the further development of the international situation.

    南斯拉夫“战斗报”发表评论
    主张恢复我国在联合国的权利
    新华社十四日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德消息：十四日的“战斗报”在关于联合国成立十周年的一篇评论中强调指出，现在已出现着更多的有利条件，可以加强联合国组织在国际关系中的活动的发展和作用。
    “战斗报”接着追述了南斯拉夫和苏联的联合宣言，并写道：只要联合国在它的结构方面一天不是一个真正的普遍性的世界组织，它就一天不能全部完成它的任务。这意味着准许新会员国参加联合国——这一直是一个非常重要的任务——的问题现在甚至变得更重要和迫切了。中华人民共和国以及所有符合联合国宪章的条件的其他国家都应当准予进入这个组织。
      “战斗报”最后写道：联合国组成情况的改进会对国际局势的进一步发展起重要的积极影响。
