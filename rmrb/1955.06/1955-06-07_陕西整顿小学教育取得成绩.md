    Shaanxi Province's Department of Culture and Education has achieved significant results in rectifying primary education since the first half of 1954. Currently, approximately 95% of the province's primary schools have undergone rectification.

    Through rectification, the tendency of blindly advancing and emphasizing quantity over quality in primary education has been overcome, classes have been adjusted, and manpower has been saved. The number of teaching staff in primary schools across the province has been reduced to more than 42,400, a decrease of more than 1,800 compared to before the rectification, while the number of students has increased from more than 1,416,000 before the rectification to more than 1,425,100. Through rectification, more than 100 teachers have been added to old revolutionary base areas such as northern and southern Shaanxi and mountainous areas with too few schools. To meet the demands of the masses, a total of 821 privately-run primary schools were established during the rectification period. Through rectification, the leadership has streamlined unnecessary meetings and organizations, while establishing some necessary systems, and has begun to strengthen the planning of work, enabling teachers to prepare lessons carefully and teach conscientiously; students have reduced complex social activities and competitions.

    After initial rectification of the teaching staff, some outstanding teachers were promoted to leadership positions in schools, and some teachers with lower levels of education were sent to junior normal schools or training courses for study. Those who violated laws and disciplines and those with extremely bad character were seriously dealt with accordingly.

    陕西整顿小学教育取得成绩
    陕西省文教厅从一九五四年上半年开始整顿小学教育工作到现在，已取得了显著成绩。现在全省经过整顿的小学校占总数的百分之九十五左右。
    经过整顿，克服了小学教育中盲目冒进，重量不重质的偏向，调整了班级，节省了人力。全省小学的教职员工核减为四万二千四百多人，比整顿前减少了一千八百多人，而学生人数却由整顿前的一百四十一万六千多人增加为一百四十二万五千一百多人。经过整顿，给陕北、陕南等老革命根据地和学校过少的山区增加了一百多名教师。为满足群众要求，在整顿期间共成立了民办小学八百二十一处。经过整顿，领导方面精简了不必要的会议和组织，同时建立了一些必要的制度，开始加强了工作的计划性，使教师能认真备课和认真教学；学生减少了庞杂的社会活动和竞赛活动。
    教师队伍经过初步整顿，一部分优秀教师被提拔担任学校领导工作，一部分文化程度较低的教师被派到初级师范学校或轮训班学习。对违法乱纪分子和品质极端恶劣的分子，严肃地分别作了处理。
