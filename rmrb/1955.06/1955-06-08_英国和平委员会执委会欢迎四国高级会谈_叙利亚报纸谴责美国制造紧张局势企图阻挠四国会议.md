    Xinhua News Agency, June 7th. According to TASS, London, June 6th: The Executive Committee of the British Peace Committee held a meeting in London on the 4th.

    The meeting was presided over by the Chairman of the Executive Committee, Gordon Schaffer. He said that one of the tasks now facing various peace-defending organizations is to urge the Conservative Party to fulfill its election promises. He said: "We must face the fact that the United States is unwilling to agree to hold a high-level meeting, and there are now signs that it is attempting to undermine such a meeting." Schaffer then said that, therefore, the peace movement must firmly demand that negotiations be held.

    The Executive Committee discussed preparations for participating in the World Peace Congress to be held in Helsinki on June 22, and issued a statement welcoming the proposal to hold a meeting of the heads of government of the four major powers.

    The statement called on the British people to immediately express their support for holding top-level negotiations by writing letters, holding meetings, petitioning, and sending representatives to meet with the Prime Minister and Members of Parliament, and demanding that the Prime Minister indicate that the British government is prepared to negotiate on the following issues in order to seek a solution acceptable to all relevant countries. These issues are: the German question, the European security question; the Taiwan question and China's seat in the United Nations, and the disarmament question, including the destruction of nuclear weapons.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 7th. According to TASS, Beirut, June 6th: The Syrian newspaper "Al-Nour" commented on the proposed four-power summit, saying that the people of the world, including the Arab people, have placed great hope in the news of the agreement by the four major powers to convene a high-level meeting. This meeting will be the most important international event of this period.

    Unfortunately, some signs have caused serious anxiety among the broad masses of people in many countries. That is, the imperialists of Western countries, especially the American aggressors, have not abandoned their activities to intensify international tensions. The United States continues to piece together aggressive blocs, and American imperialists and their British partners are exerting brutal pressure on Arab countries, especially Syria, to force these countries to join the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty. In Indochina, American imperialists are trying their best to undermine the Geneva Accords and restore hostile relations.

    "Al-Nour" said that the people of the world must intensify their struggle against all the conspiracies of the imperialists who want to launch another war and crush the American attempt to obstruct the success of this important four-power meeting.

    英国和平委员会执委会欢迎四国高级会谈
    叙利亚报纸谴责美国制造紧张局势企图阻挠四国会议
    新华社七日讯　据塔斯社伦敦六日讯：英国和平委员会执行委员会四日在伦敦举行会议。
    执行委员会主席戈登·夏菲尔主持会议。他说，各个保卫和平的组织现在面临的一项任务就是敦促保守党实现竞选诺言。他说：“我们必须正视这个事实：美国是不愿意同意召开高级会议的，现在有迹象说明它企图破坏这种会议。”夏菲尔接着说，因此，和平运动必须坚决要求举行谈判。
    执行委员会讨论了参加六月二十二日在赫尔辛基举行的世界和平大会的筹备工作，并且发表声明欢迎关于举行四大国政府首脑会谈的建议。
    声明号召英国人民用写信、开会、请愿、派代表见首相和议员的办法立即表示自己支持关于举行最高级谈判的要求，并且要求首相表示，英国政府准备就下列问题进行谈判，以求得一个为各有关国家都可以接受的解决办法。这些问题就是：德国问题、欧洲安全问题；台湾问题和中国在联合国的席位问题以及包括销毁核子武器问题在内的裁军问题。
    新华社七日讯　据塔斯社贝鲁特六日讯：叙利亚报纸“努尔报”就拟议中的四国政府首脑会议发表评论说，全世界人民，包括阿拉伯人民在内，都对四大国同意召开高级会议的协议的消息寄以很大的希望。这一会议将是这一时期中最重要的国际事件。
    不幸，有些征兆在许多国家的广大群众中间引起了严重的焦虑。这就是西方国家的帝国主义分子，首先是美国侵略分子，并没有放弃他们加剧国际紧张局势的活动。美国继续在拼凑侵略集团，美帝国主义者及其英国伙伴正在对阿拉伯国家施以粗暴的压力，来强迫这些国家，首先是叙利亚，参加土耳其—伊拉克军事条约。在印度支那，美帝国主义者正尽力来破坏日内瓦协定和恢复敌对状态。
    “努尔报”说，全世界人民，必须加紧进行斗争反对帝国主义者想发动另一次战争的一切阴谋，粉碎美国企图阻碍这次重要的四大国会议获得成功的活动。
