Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 22nd - According to a TASS report from Moscow: The Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Nehru, held a press conference in Moscow on the 21st. Soviet, Indian, and other countries' journalists attended the press conference. Nehru answered questions raised by the journalists at the conference.

　　A "Pravda" reporter and a TASS reporter asked him about how to strengthen the friendship between the people of India and the Soviet Union and his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union. Nehru said: Regarding what measures should be taken to enable the people of India and the Soviet Union to understand each other more quickly, I think the usual measures should be taken, that is, arrangements for economic, trade, and cultural ties. He said he was deeply impressed by some of the factories he had visited, which proved the great achievements of the Soviet people.

　　A "Pravda" reporter asked: In your opinion, what steps must be taken to ease the tension in Asia and the world?

　　Nehru replied: The main and primary task is to create an atmosphere conducive to easing international tensions: to be more friendly to each other and not to say insulting words. Secondly, each issue must be studied individually and solutions sought. But the main thing is to create a situation conducive to easing international tensions.

　　In answering a question from an American "New York Times" reporter, Nehru said that he might issue a joint statement with the Soviet leaders before he left.

　　A British "Daily Worker" reporter asked about the Soviet Union's attitude towards India's national development plan. Nehru said: The Soviet government has stated that it is happy to give us technical assistance and provide equipment to implement our development plan.

　　In answering a question from an "Izvestia" reporter about Indian-Soviet cultural ties, Nehru pointed out: Developing cultural ties between countries is of great significance, as it helps to deepen mutual understanding and create a friendly atmosphere. I hope that cultural relations between the Soviet Union and India will continue to develop smoothly in the future.

　　A reporter from China's "People's Daily" asked: How can international cooperation be expanded, trust between countries strengthened, and international tensions eased?

　　Nehru said: This is a big question. The easing of international tensions can only be achieved gradually, step by step. One cannot expect any magical changes. First, there must be a desire to ease international tensions. Then, efforts must be made to realize this desire. The summit meeting of the four major powers will soon open in Geneva. Everyone hopes that this meeting will be able to ease tensions to a certain extent, and even if some issues cannot be resolved quickly, a way to resolve these issues should be found.

　　An American "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" reporter asked Nehru what specific issues he thought the meeting should discuss.

　　Nehru said: It is said that the Geneva meeting will be a somewhat informal meeting with no strictly defined agenda. Any issue can be discussed at this meeting. Obviously, issues that have exacerbated international tensions will be involved. For example, the situation in the Far East and European issues. I do not know whether the issue of Indochina will be raised.

　　A "New Age" magazine reporter raised a question about the impact of the Asian-African Conference on the common struggle for peace and security of Asian and African countries. Nehru replied that this conference had a great impact. The main thing is that countries with different social and economic systems and national structures can gather together and reach a consensus on a very important declaration. He drew everyone's special attention to the declaration issued by the conference on promoting universal peace and cooperation, and said that the Bandung Conference can serve as a model.

　　At the request of a reporter from the United Press International, Nehru spoke in more detail about the proposed Soviet technical and material assistance to India, talking about the Soviet Union's assistance in building steel plants in India, the signing of friendly trade contracts between the two countries, Soviet experts providing opinions to India on various issues, Indian industrial workers visiting the Soviet Union, and so on. He said that this does not refer to any financial assistance. What is being discussed here is technical assistance and the sale of equipment to us.

　　Someone asked about the path for India's further economic development. In his reply, Nehru mentioned the first five-year plan implemented in India and said that in the next five-year plan, special emphasis will be placed on the development of heavy industry.

　　In answering a question from a "New York Herald Tribune" reporter about whether India and the Soviet Union would cooperate in the development of atomic energy, Nehru said, "We have not discussed this issue. We may consult with each other on this issue in the future."

　　A reporter from the Indian "Statesman" newspaper wanted to know if there were any conditions attached to Soviet assistance to India. Nehru replied: "The Soviet Union's assistance to our country is, of course, not subject to any political constraints."

　　At the end of the press conference, Nehru told reporters that he had invited the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Bulganin, to visit India, and Bulganin had accepted his invitation.

　　Awarded Honorary Doctorate of Law

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 22nd - According to a TASS report from Moscow: The Academic Committee of the Soviet National Moscow University, based on the recommendation of the Faculty of Law Committee, unanimously decided at a meeting held on the 21st to award Jawaharlal Nehru the honorary Doctorate of Law from Moscow University.

　　Dean of the Faculty of Law, Losin, explained this proposal, saying: "We know that Mr. Nehru, according to his education and practical work experience, is our peer. He is an active participant in the national liberation movement, a fighter for India's national independence, and a political leader of a great country." Losin also said that as the Foreign Minister of India, Mr. Nehru has always upheld the principles of international law, advocated the recognition of the sovereignty of large and small countries, and advocated the easing of international tensions in Asia and the world.

　　Visiting the Soviet Atomic Energy Power Station

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 22nd - TASS Moscow, June 22nd: The Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Nehru, and his entourage visited the Soviet Academy of Sciences' first atomic energy power station on the 22nd.

　　Accompanying Nehru on his visit to the atomic energy power station were Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Kaganovich, and Mikoyan, Soviet First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kuznetsov, Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Menon, and embassy staff.

    尼赫鲁在莫斯科的活动
    举行记者招待会
    新华社二十二日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：印度共和国总理尼赫鲁于二十一日在莫斯科举行了记者招待会。出席招待会的有苏联、印度及其他国家的记者。尼赫鲁在招待会上答复了记者们提出的问题。
      “真理报”记者和塔斯社记者向他提出了关于怎样加强印苏两国人民的友谊和他访问苏联的印象的问题。尼赫鲁说：关于应当采取什么措施使印苏两国人民比较快地互相了解的问题，我认为应当采取通常的措施，就是安排经济、贸易和文化联系的措施。他说他对访问过的一些工厂的印象很深，这证明苏联人民的巨大成就。
    “真理报”记者问：按照您的意见，为了缓和亚洲和全世界的紧张局势，必须采取什么步骤？
    尼赫鲁回答说：主要和首要的任务是建立适合于缓和国际紧张局势的气氛：彼此的态度要更加友好，不要讲侮辱别人的话。其次，必须把每一个问题单独地加以研究并求得解决。但是主要的是建立一个适合于缓和国际紧张局势的局面。
    尼赫鲁在回答美国“纽约时报”记者的问题时说，他在离开以前可能要和苏联的领导者发表一项联合声明。
    英国“工人日报”记者问到苏联对印度国家发展计划的态度。尼赫鲁说：苏联政府表示，它乐于给我们技术上的帮助和提供设备以实现我国发展计划。
    尼赫鲁在回答“消息报”记者关于印苏文化联系的问题时指出：发展各国之间的文化联系有很重大的意义，它有助于加深相互了解和建立友好的气氛。我希望苏联和印度之间的文化关系今后仍顺利地发展。
    中国“人民日报”记者问：怎样才能扩大国际合作，加强各国之间的信任和缓和国际紧张局势？
    尼赫鲁说：这是一个很大的问题。国际紧张局势的缓和只能逐渐地、一步一步地达到。不能期望有什么魔术般的变化。首先，必须有达成缓和国际紧张局势的愿望。然后，必须努力实现这种愿望。四大国政府首脑会议不久将在日内瓦开幕。大家都盼望这次会议能够在一定程度上缓和紧张局势，即使不能使一些问题得到迅速的解决，也应找到解决这些问题的办法。
    美国“圣路易邮报”记者问尼赫鲁认为这一会议应讨论哪些具体问题。
    尼赫鲁说：据说日内瓦会议在某种程度上将是一个非正式的会议，没有严格规定的议程。这一会议可以讨论任何一个问题。显然，将涉及到使国际紧张局势加剧的问题。例如，远东局势和欧洲问题，我不知道是否会提出关于印度支那的问题。
      “新时代”杂志记者提出了关于亚非会议对亚非国家的为和平和安全的共同斗争的影响的问题。尼赫鲁回答说，这一会议有很大的影响。主要的是，社会和经济制度以及国家结构互不相同的国家能够聚集在一起，对一个很重要的声明取得了一致的协议。他提请大家特别注意会议发表的关于促进普遍和平和合作的宣言，并说，万隆会议可以作为一个范例。
    尼赫鲁应美国合众社记者的要求较具体地谈到了拟议中的苏联对印度的技术和物资援助情况，谈到苏联援助印度建筑钢铁厂、两国签订了友好的贸易合同、苏联专家在印度就各种问题向印度提供意见、印度工业工作人员访问苏联等。他说，这里所说的不是任何财政援助。这里所谈的是技术援助和出售给我们设备。
    有人问到印度进一步发展经济的道路。尼赫鲁在回答中提到印度所实行的第一个五年计划，并且说在下一个五年计划中将特别着重发展重工业。
    尼赫鲁在回答“纽约先驱论坛报”记者关于在发展原子能方面印度和苏联是否合作的问题时说，我们没有讨论这个问题。可能将来我们会就这个问题相互磋商。
    印度“政治家报”记者希望知道苏联对印度的援助是否有什么条件。尼赫鲁回答说：苏联对我国的援助当然是不附以任何政治约束的。
    在记者招待会结束时，尼赫鲁告诉记者们说，他已邀请苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁访问印度，布尔加宁已接受了他的邀请。
    被授予名誉法学博士学位
    新华社二十二日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联国立莫斯科大学学术委员会根据法律系委员会的建议，在二十一日举行的会议上一致决定：授予贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁以莫斯科大学名誉法学博士学位。
    法律系主任洛辛说明这项建议时说：我们知道，尼赫鲁先生按照所受的教育和实际工作阅历，是我们的同行，他是一个民族解放运动的积极参加者，是争取印度的民族独立的战士，是伟大国家的政治领袖。洛辛又说，作为印度外交部长的尼赫鲁先生，过去和现在一直维护国际法的原则，主张承认大小国家的主权，主张缓和亚洲以及全世界的国际紧张局势。
    参观苏联原子能发电站
    新华社二十二日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：印度共和国总理尼赫鲁和他的随行人员二十二日参观了苏联科学院第一个原子能发电站。
    陪同尼赫鲁参观原子能发电站的有苏联部长会议第一副主席卡冈诺维奇和米高扬，苏联外交部第一副部长库兹涅佐夫，印度驻苏联大使梅农和大使馆人员。
