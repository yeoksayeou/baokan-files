The Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a notice on the 17th to all universities, the provincial and municipal committees of the Youth League, and the committees of the Youth League in all universities regarding organizing university students to carry out activities to comfort and celebrate with the People's Liberation Army and workers at key construction sites during the summer vacation.

The notice said: In order to enable students to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, enhance their love for the People's Liberation Army and their ideas of serving the working people, receive patriotic education and labor education, and enrich their vacation life; and at the same time, to encourage the fighting will of the People's Liberation Army and the production enthusiasm of workers and peasants, universities can organize students to go to certain PLA garrisons and key construction sites to comfort and celebrate with the PLA or workers and peasants.

The notice requires that the Youth League organizations and student unions of each school should organize this activity under the leadership and assistance of the school administration and the provincial and municipal committees of the Youth League. If the area for comforting is nearby, students can be widely organized to go; if the journey is far or transportation conditions are difficult, in order to save expenses and facilitate leadership, the number of representatives should not be too large, and the time should not be too long. Beforehand, in addition to mobilizing students to write letters of慰问 (comfort/condolence), preparing some inexpensive but meaningful souvenirs and various entertainment programs, they can also prepare to hold sports competitions with the People's Liberation Army, workers, and peasants, conduct visits, report on learning progress, and meet with heroes and model workers.

The notice said: During the activity, attention should be paid to the ideological education of students, and efforts should be made to cultivate their fine qualities of being strong, brave, not afraid of hardship, observing discipline, and humbly learning from the People's Liberation Army, workers, and peasants. After the comforting and celebration activities, it should be communicated to the students in the school to expand the impact. All schools should pay attention to thrift and avoid extravagance and waste in carrying out comforting and celebration activities. (Xinhua News Agency)

    高等教育部、教育部和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会十七日向各高等学校，青年团各省、市委，青年团各高等学校委员会发出关于暑假组织高等学校学生与解放军及重点工程工地工人进行慰问联欢活动的通知。
    通知说：为了使学生向工农兵学习，增强热爱解放军和为劳动人民服务的思想，受到爱国主义教育和劳动教育，丰富假期生活；同时为了鼓舞解放军的战斗意志和工农的生产热情，各高等学校可组织学生到某些解放军驻地及重点工程工地向解放军或工人农民进行慰问和联欢活动。
    通知要求各校青年团的组织和学生会应在学校行政和青年团省、市委领导和帮助下组织这一活动。慰问地区如在附近，可广泛组织学生前往；如路程较远或交通条件较困难的地区，为了节约经费，便利领导，代表人数不要过多，时间也不宜过长。事前除发动同学写慰问信，准备一些花钱不多而富有意义的纪念品和各种文娱节目外，还可准备与解放军、工人、农民举行体育比赛，进行参观访问，报告学习情况，与英雄模范会面等等活动。
    通知说：在活动过程中应重视对学生的思想教育工作，注意培养他们坚强勇敢、不畏艰苦，遵守纪律，虚心向解放军、工人、农民学习的优良品质。慰问联欢后应向在校学生进行传达，以扩大影响。各校进行慰问联欢活动应注意节约，避免铺张浪费。  （新华社）
