    Xinhua News Agency, London dispatch: The strike of British railway workers is still continuing.
    British railway transportation authorities have consistently refused to agree to the striking workers' demands for increased wages.
    On the 2nd, British Prime Minister Eden convened the first cabinet meeting after the general election. News reports indicate that the meeting discussed the issue of further exercising "emergency powers" to deal with the railway workers' strike and the dockworkers' strike, which has persisted for twelve days.
    With the development of the strike, the right-wing leaders of the Trades Union Congress are increasingly assiduously assisting the Conservative government in sabotage, attempting to induce the strike leaders to agree to end the strike, but they themselves admit that they have still made no progress in this regard.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 5th dispatch from TASS, London, June 4th: The strike of more than 70,000 British engine drivers and firemen has reached seven days. The striking workers have demonstrated 100% solidarity.
    Despite the British bourgeois propaganda machine's attempts to stir up public opinion against the strike, this strike struggle has still received the support of the broad masses of working people throughout the country.
    According to newspaper reports, the Foundry Workers' Union and the Birmingham District Committee of the National Union of Machine Manufacturing Workers have respectively called on their members to stop repairing locomotives throughout the strike period.
    Workers in Ashford and Durham have responded to this call. Gardner, General Secretary of the Foundry Workers' Union, said that his union firmly supports the striking workers.
    Dockworkers in Glasgow and miners in South Wales oppose the use of automobile transportation to replace the railway transportation paralyzed by the strike, and dockworkers have refused to transport ore from ships to trucks.
    The strike of 20,000 dockworkers in major British ports has continued for two weeks. According to Reuters, the crew of the "Ascania" ship docked in the Port of Liverpool began their strike again five days ago. They demand improved working conditions. On June 3rd, the entire crew of two other ships sailing in the Atlantic also joined the strike.

    新华社五日讯　据塔斯社伦敦四日讯：英国七万多名机车司机和司炉工人的罢工已达七天。罢工工人们表现了百分之百的团结。

    据报纸消息，翻砂工人联合会和全国机器制造工人工会伯明翰区委员会已经分别号召它们的会员在整个罢工期间停止修理机车的工作。
    亚施福德和达拉谟的工人已经响应了这一号召。翻砂工人联合会总书记加德纳说，他的工会坚决支持罢工工人。
    格拉斯哥的搬运工人和南威尔士的矿工反对用汽车运输来代替因罢工而瘫痪的铁路运输工作，搬运工人并且拒绝把矿石从轮船上搬运到载重汽车上去。
    英国各大港口两万名码头工人的罢工已经继续两周。据路透社说，停泊在利物浦港的“阿斯卡尼亚号”轮船的船员又在五天前开始罢工。他们要求改善劳动条件。六月三日，航行于大西洋的其他两只轮船的全体船员也参加了罢工。
