Constantly Heighten Revolutionary Vigilance
    Fang Guangtao

    The "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," published in the People's Daily on June 10th, provides a clear answer to the questions of "Who is Hu Feng's master?" and "What is the political background of the Hu Feng clique?" The Hu Feng clique is a hidden counter-revolutionary organization with deep connections to our class enemies at home and abroad. Hu Feng and many of the core members of the Hu Feng clique have long been loyal running dogs of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Those who harbored the naive idea that "the Hu Feng clique is just a small group of ambitious figures in the cultural world, and they may not necessarily have any political background" can now suddenly realize the truth. Can the Hu Feng elements who have been strongly defending Hu Feng still quibble in the face of these ironclad proofs? For twenty years, Hu Feng disguised himself as a revolutionary, hid within the people, and consistently engaged in anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. We were deceived by Hu Feng for twenty years, and only today have we seen their hideous and ugly faces. After reading these "secret letters," I feel extremely indignant! The anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities carried out by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique are extremely vile. The people of the whole country will never forgive such insidious and ferocious enemies. I demand that the People's Government immediately severely punish Hu Feng and the members of the Hu Feng clique who have committed serious crimes according to law.

    The Hu Feng incident is a serious lesson for me personally. I worked in the Chinese Language and Literature Department of Nanjing University for several years. In 1950, Lu Ling, a core member of the Hu Feng clique, also lectured in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University for nearly a year. He spread absurd "literary theories" to students in and after class, but I did not pay attention to it. I only knew that he was a "young writer" praised by Hu Feng, but I did not realize that he and Hu Feng were secretly engaged in counter-revolutionary crimes. My negligence was so great! In this transitional period of increasingly sharp and complex class struggle, I must constantly heighten revolutionary vigilance in the future, and I must strive to learn the ability to distinguish counter-revolutionary elements in the struggle. This is the task of every member of the entire revolutionary ranks.

    Resolutely and thoroughly crushing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is the will of the people of the whole country. Literary and art workers in our Jiangsu Province must actively participate in this struggle. We must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, heighten our vigilance a thousand-fold, continue to expose the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique, and investigate the members of the Hu Feng clique. Only by purging all the counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the revolutionary ranks can our revolutionary literary and art cause advance victoriously. In order to defend the fruits of the revolutionary victory and to defend the socialist construction cause of our great motherland, we must wage a resolute struggle against all the hidden counter-revolutionary elements who are plotting sabotage, and carry this struggle through to the end.

    时时刻刻提高革命警惕性
    方光焘
    六月十日人民日报公布的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”，对“胡风的主子是谁”和“胡风集团的政治背景”问题，作了明确的答案。胡风集团是同我们国内外阶级敌人有着深远联系的、隐蔽的反革命组织。胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子很早以来就是蒋匪帮的忠实走狗。抱有“胡风集团不过是文化界少数野心分子的小集团，他们不一定有什么政治背景”的天真想法的人们，现在是可以恍然大悟了。替胡风强辩的胡风分子，在这些铁证的前面，还能再狡赖吗？二十年来，胡风伪装革命，潜藏在人民内部，一贯地干着反党、反人民、反革命的活动。我们被胡风欺骗了二十年，直到今天才看清了他们的狰狞丑恶的面貌。我读了这些“密信”之后，真感到无比的愤恨！胡风反革命集团所进行的反党、反人民、反革命的活动是十分恶劣的。全国人民决不宽恕这样最阴险最凶恶的敌人。我要求人民政府立即依法严惩胡风和胡风集团中犯有严重罪行的分子。
    胡风事件，对我个人来说，是一个严重的教训。我在南京大学中国语言文学系工作过几年，一九五○年胡风集团的骨干分子路翎也曾经在南京大学中文系讲课将近一年。他在课堂上和课后向学生散布了荒谬的“文艺理论”，我竟不闻不问。我只知道他是胡风吹捧的“青年作家”，却毫不觉察他和胡风都在暗地里干着反革命的罪恶勾当。我的麻痹大意竟到了这样的程度！在这阶级斗争日趋尖锐复杂的过渡时期中，我今后必须时时刻刻提高革命的警惕性，并且要在斗争中努力学会辨别反革命分子的本领。这是整个革命队伍中每个成员的任务。
    坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团是全国人民的意志。我们江苏省的文艺工作者必须积极地参加这一斗争。我们必须更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，千百倍地提高警惕，继续揭露胡风集团的反革命活动，追查胡风集团分子。只有把一切暗藏在革命队伍中的反革命分子清洗出去，我们的革命的文学艺术事业才能胜利地向前进展。为了保卫革命胜利的果实，为了保卫伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业，我们一定要对一切阴谋破坏的暗藏的反革命分子作坚决的斗争，并把这一斗争进行到底。
