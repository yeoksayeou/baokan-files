To the Editor:

Our Tongguanshan Mining Bureau and its affiliated units need approximately 13,000 kilograms of cotton waste annually. Due to textile factories increasing the utilization rate of cotton yarn, the supply of cotton waste has decreased and is insufficient. Some units have resorted to using white cotton cloth as a substitute. This is not only more than twice as expensive as cotton waste but also consumes more of the country's cotton cloth.

Currently, some units within our Mining Bureau are saving cotton waste by collecting dirty cotton waste and cotton fabric scraps from labor protection products, boiling them clean with alkaline water, and using them as a substitute for new cotton waste. This is not only effective but also allows for repeated use two or three times. According to a rough estimate, using this type of waste material to replace cotton waste can save at least 200 yuan per 100 kilograms. If our Mining Bureau were to fully promote this practice, it could save over 20,000 yuan annually.

All industrial and mining units across the country use large quantities of cotton waste. I suggest that these units collect and reuse waste cotton waste and cotton fabrics. Although this may seem like a small matter, if everyone pays attention and implements it, it can save the country a significant amount of cotton yarn and funds.

### 推广节约棉纱头的办法

    推广节约棉纱头的办法编辑同志：
    我们铜官山矿务局所属各单位每年共需用棉纱头一万三千公斤左右。由于各纺织工厂提高了棉纱的利用率，棉纱头减少了，供应不足。有的单位就用白龙头布来代替。这不但价钱要比棉纱头贵两倍多，而且也多消耗了国家的棉布。
    目前我们矿务局的有些单位为了节省棉纱头，把用脏了的棉纱头和劳动保护品中棉织物的废料回收，用碱水煮洗干净，代替新棉纱头。这样不但好用，而且可以连续回用两三次。据粗略的估计，利用这种废料代替棉纱头，每用一百公斤，至少可以节省二百元。如果我们矿务局全面推广这种做法，每年就可以节省人民币二万多元。
    全国各工矿单位都要使用大量棉纱头，我建议这些单位把废棉纱头和废棉织品回收再用。这虽然看起来似乎是件小事，如果大家都注意实行，就可以给国家节省大量的棉纱和资金。
