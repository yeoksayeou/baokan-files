Xinhua News Agency, May 31st dispatch from New York: "New York Post" reported that the New York City Citizens' Committee on Children's Issues recently held a meeting to discuss the situation of children in the United States. After analyzing various situations, the meeting came to the conclusion that the New York City government authorities' "neglect of children's needs is shocking."

The committee pointed out that one problem currently facing the United States is the rapid increase in infant mortality. In the Bedford-Stuyvesant district of Brooklyn, New York, the infant mortality rate increased by more than 60 percent from January to February this year. In the Central Harlem district of New York, the infant mortality rate also increased by about 30 percent.

The committee pointed out that despite the fact that vast numbers of children are not receiving proper care, only a negligible amount of money is allocated in the New York City government's budget for children's health agencies, welfare agencies, schools, and recreational facilities. Due to insufficient funding, institutions related to children's welfare are currently forced to refuse services to many children. "More than 200,000 poor children between the ages of one and six do not receive medical and health care. In 25 of New York's 75 child health stations, the waiting time for physical examinations for newborns is more than ten to thirty days. ... And in 30 middle schools, more than 110,000 students do not receive medical and health care."

Xinhua News Agency, May 30th dispatch from Washington: Washington Police Department Crime Investigation Team Leader Blick testified before the U.S. Congressional Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency on the 26th, confirming that in the U.S. capital, many boys and girls aged fourteen and fifteen are used as models to produce various obscene pictures. He said: The number of young girls acting as models for such obscene pictures is increasing. According to Blick's estimates, in the past two years, the value of various obscene films, books, and photos inspected in Washington alone is 50,000 U.S. dollars. He said that many sexual crimes are a direct consequence of young people seeing these things.

Xinhua News Agency, May 31st dispatch according to TASS, Montevideo, May 30th: In many Latin American countries, children's conditions are tragic, and the mortality rate is very high.

In Brazil, 90,000 infants under the age of one year die every year. The Brazilian newspaper "Popular Newspaper" wrote that famine is the main reason why Brazil has a high child mortality rate. The Chilean magazine "Our Times" pointed out that due to hunger and lack of proper care, 70 percent of children in Paraguay die before the age of ten. The child mortality rates in Bolivia, Guatemala and other Latin American countries have also reached very high levels.

Latin American newspapers also pointed out the large number of children who are destitute and the lack of schools and teachers. According to materials from the Bolivian "Popular Newspaper," only 18 out of every 100 children in Bolivia can attend school. In rural Brazil, 80 percent of children have no opportunity to study. In Puerto Rico, 50 percent of school-age children cannot attend school.

The Brazilian newspaper "Ultima Hora" wrote, when discussing the fate of Latin American children, "It is unfortunate to be a child."

    美国和拉丁美洲的儿童生活境遇悲惨
    新华社三十一日讯　纽约消息：“纽约邮报”报道，纽约市儿童问题市民委员会最近举行了一次会议，讨论美国儿童处境问题。会议在分析各种情况后得出一个结论：纽约市政府当局“对儿童的需要的漠视是惊人的”。
    这个委员会指出，美国目前面临的一个问题是婴孩的死亡率的迅速增加。在纽约布鲁克林的培德福德—斯特维辛区，婴孩死亡率从今年一月份到二月份就增加了百分之六十以上。在纽约的中哈莱姆区，婴孩死亡率也增加了百分之三十左右。
    委员会指出，尽管广大儿童并没有得到适当的照顾，然而在纽约市政府的预算中只拨出微不足道的款项来作为儿童保健机关、福利机关、学校、娱乐场所的经费。由于经费不足，同儿童福利有关的机构目前不得不拒绝替许多儿童服务，“二十多万从一岁到六岁的贫苦儿童得不到医药卫生照顾。在纽约七十五个儿童保健站中，有二十五个保健站的初生婴孩体格检查的候诊时间需要等十天到三十天以上，……而在三十个中学中，有十一万以上的学生得不到医疗卫生照顾。”
    新华社三十日讯　华盛顿消息：华盛顿警察局罪行调查组组长布利克二十六日在美国国会青、少年犯罪小组委员会作证时证实，在美国首都，许多十四五岁的男女少年被用作模特儿来摄制各种淫秽的图片。他说：充当这种淫秽图片的模特儿的少女越来越多了。据布利克估计，两年来，在华盛顿单是被检查到的各种淫秽的影片、书籍和照片等就价值五万美元。他说，许多性的罪行就是青少年看了这些东西的直接后果。
    新华社三十一日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚三十日讯：在许多拉丁美洲国家中，儿童的处境悲惨，死亡率非常高。
    巴西每年有九万名不满周岁的婴儿死亡。巴西
  “人民报”写道，饥馑是使巴西成为儿童死亡率很高的国家的主要原因。智利杂志“我们的时代”指出，由于饥饿和缺乏适当的照顾，巴拉圭有百分之七十的儿童不满十岁便夭亡了。玻利维亚、危地马拉和其他拉丁美洲国家的儿童死亡率也达到了很高的指标。
    拉丁美洲国家报纸还指出大批儿童无依无靠的情况以及缺乏学校和教师的情况。根据玻利维亚“人民报”的材料，玻利维亚每一百个儿童中只有十八个能上学。巴西乡村中有百分之八十的儿童没有可能学习。在波多黎各，有百分之五十的学龄儿童不能上学。
    巴西“最后一点钟报”在谈到拉丁美洲儿童的命运时写道，“做儿童是不幸的”。
