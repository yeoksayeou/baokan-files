Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: June 27th marks the one-year anniversary of the US imperialist armed intervention in Guatemala. The Executive Committee of the Guatemalan Workers' Confederation and the Executive Committee of the Guatemalan National Farmers' Association have jointly issued a letter to labor and peasant organizations of all countries on this occasion.

The letter states that the anniversary of the imperialists' intervention in the affairs of the Guatemalan people is approaching. Under the autocratic rule of Armas, the Guatemalan people continue to hold high the banner of struggle for national autonomy, adhere to their opposition to foreign intervention, and work diligently to regain their democratic freedoms and trade union rights. Despite countless murders, tortures, persecutions, and imprisonments, workers, peasants, and other democratic forces have never yielded and have maintained a fighting stance. More and more people are clearly seeing that the government imposed on Guatemala by the United Fruit Company and the US State Department is one that betrays the motherland and abolishes all democratic freedoms and trade union rights.

The letter points out that in Guatemala, hundreds of workers and civil servants have been dismissed, and thousands of peasants have been driven out of the land they acquired in the land reform. Nearly 70,000 laborers are now unemployed nationwide. In the past democratic regime, workers and peasants had the freedom to establish their own organizations and raise their own issues. This period awakened the Guatemalan people, who had suffered for decades under feudal tyranny and the shackles of imperialism, and enabled them to compare a democratic regime with a tyrannical one. These are the reasons why the camp opposing foreign intervention and the foreign agent Armas is growing stronger day by day.

In the letter, the Executive Committee of the Guatemalan Workers' Confederation and the Executive Committee of the Guatemalan National Farmers' Association call on labor and peasant organizations of all countries to support the struggle of the Guatemalan people in various ways on the occasion of the one-year anniversary of US imperialist intervention in Guatemala.

    美帝国主义武装干涉危地马拉一周年
    危地马拉工会和农会向各国工农组织发出呼吁
    新华社二十五日讯  六月二十七日是美帝国主义武装干涉危地马拉的一周年。危地马拉工人联合会执行委员会和危地马拉全国农民协会执行委员会为此联合发表了致各国工会和农民组织的信。
    信中说，帝国主义者干涉危地马拉人民的一周年纪念日将要到来了。危地马拉人民在阿马斯的专横统治下继续高举着争取民族自主的斗争旗帜，坚持着反对外国干涉的立场，并且为重新获得民主自由权利和工会权利而紧张地工作。尽管遭到无数的谋杀、拷打、迫害和监禁，工人和农民及其他民主力量从没有屈服并且保持着战斗的姿态。越来越多的人清楚地看到，联合果品公司和美国国务院所强加于危地马拉的政府是一个出卖祖国和取消所有民主自由和工会权利的政府。
    信件指出，在危地马拉，成百个工人和公务员被解雇了，成千个农民被驱逐出他们在土地改革中得来的土地。全国已有近七万劳动者失业。在过去的民主政权下，工人和农民有建立自己的组织的自由和提出自己的问题的自由，这一时期使几十年来遭受封建暴政和帝国主义枷锁的危地马拉人民觉醒过来了，使他们能够对一个民主政权和一个暴政的政权作比较。这些都是为什么反对外国干涉和外国代理人阿马斯的阵营日益壮大的原因。
    危地马拉工人联合会执行委员会和危地马拉全国农民协会执行委员会在信中呼吁各国工会和农民组织在美帝国主义干涉危地马拉一周年的时候，用各种方式声援危地马拉人民的斗争。
