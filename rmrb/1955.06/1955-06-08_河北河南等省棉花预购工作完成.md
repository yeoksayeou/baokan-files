　　Cotton Pre-Purchase Work Completed in Hebei, Henan, and Other Provinces

　　(Report from this newspaper) The cotton pre-purchase work in the main cotton-producing areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces has been basically completed.

　　Farmers in Hebei Province signed more than 293,000 pre-purchase cotton contracts with the state. The advance deposits received by farmers from these contracts amounted to more than 35 million yuan. Farmers who pre-sold cotton received more cloth and grain purchase certificates than ordinary farmers. The majority of the pre-purchase deposits were used by farmers to increase cotton production. As of May 15th, the three main cotton-producing regions of Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Xingtai had sold more than 55.5 million jin of fertilizer in conjunction with the pre-purchase of cotton; a large number of livestock and more than 100,000 pieces of new and used farm tools were also sold.

　　In Shandong Province, the pre-purchase work in the main cotton-producing regions of Huimin, Liaocheng, Dezhou, and Jiaozhou has been basically completed. The province has issued more than 19 million yuan in pre-purchase deposits and issued preferential supply tickets for grain and cotton cloth to farmers who pre-sold cotton. Many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers have appropriately expanded the area under cotton cultivation in accordance with state requirements. According to statistics from seven key point townships in Guangrao, Guanxian, Shanghe, Enxian, Changan, Fucheng, and Zhangqiu counties, the area under cotton cultivation this year has increased by more than 30% compared to last year.

　　The amount of cotton pre-purchased in Henan Province is equivalent to 148.4% of the amount pre-purchased last year. Many areas are currently in the stage of reviewing and verifying pre-purchase contracts. Farmers who pre-sold cotton in various areas received advance deposits from supply and marketing cooperatives and also received preferential supply tickets for grain and cotton cloth. It is estimated that cotton-growing farmers throughout the province have used more than 50% of their total deposits to purchase means of production. In Beiguanzhuang Township, Jiyuan County, nineteen agricultural production cooperatives and one mutual aid team used 68% of the deposits they received to purchase cake fertilizer, weeding hoes, waterwheels, pesticides, and tools for summer harvesting and planting from the supply and marketing cooperatives.

　　In Shanxi Province, by mid-May, more than 7,500 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 58,000 mutual aid teams had signed pre-purchase cotton contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives. More than 1.5 million dan of cotton were pre-sold, nearly half of which was pre-sold by agricultural production cooperatives. After pre-selling cotton, farmers reorganized their production for this year in accordance with the national plan. The cotton planting area in the main cotton-producing area of southern Shanxi has been expanded by more than 10% compared to last year, and the planting area of ​​the "517" superior cotton variety has increased fourfold compared to last year. In Zhaicun Township, Linfen County, fifteen agricultural production cooperatives also held a meeting of member representatives and decided to use more than 80% of the deposit to purchase means of production.

　　According to incomplete statistics, the pre-purchased cotton in 38 counties, including Jingyang, Sanyuan, Gaoling, Xianyang, and Xingping, in the main cotton-producing area of ​​Shaanxi Province, accounts for more than 75% of the province's cotton pre-purchase plan for this year. Among them, twenty counties, including Lintong, Weinan, Dali, and Sanyuan, have exceeded the pre-purchase plan by approximately 6% to 12%. Supply and marketing cooperatives across the province have signed more than 46,000 cotton pre-purchase contracts with farmers. With the exception of a few counties that are still continuing to sign contracts, most other areas are in the process of reviewing and verifying contracts.

　　Farmers in Jiangsu Province have pre-sold a total of more than 2.57 million dan of ginned cotton to the state, exceeding the state's planned pre-purchase amount by 5.4%. Cotton farmers in Nantong and Yancheng regions, the famous Dai character cotton producing areas, have pre-sold a total of more than 1.89 million dan of ginned cotton to the state this year; the pre-purchase figures for the early-maturing Si character cotton have also increased by 52.4% compared to last year's actual purchases. In the pre-purchase of cotton, organized cotton farmers took the lead in signing more than 128,900 pre-purchase contracts with the state. In coordination with the pre-purchase, the state paid cotton farmers an interest-free deposit of 21.45 million yuan, provided preferential supply of more than 20 million jin of grain and a certain proportion of cotton cloth, and supplied more than 210,000 dan of cotton seeds and a large number of soybean cake and other commercial fertilizers. Therefore, the production enthusiasm of cotton farmers has been greatly encouraged. Cotton farmers in the Nantong region started planting about a week earlier this year than in previous years. In Chengnan Township, Nanhui County, cotton fields where strip planting is promoted account for 83.4% of the planting area this year. According to statistics, cotton farmers in various areas have purchased more than 3,500 sprayers and other agricultural machinery, and more than 920,000 jin of various pesticides from supply and marketing cooperatives. Currently, the majority of cotton farmers are intensively engaged in checking seedlings, replanting, pest control, and protecting seedlings to promote a bumper cotton harvest.
