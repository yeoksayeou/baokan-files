Heilongjiang Counties and Farms Should Not Hoard and Waste Grain
Zhou Hai

In Heilongjiang Province, many state-owned farms in various counties have a serious phenomenon of hoarding and wasting grain. According to our understanding in recent months, the Jixi, Bei’an, and Bin County farms alone have hoarded more than 50,000 jin of grain. How much is hoarded in the province's more than one hundred farms? It is difficult to estimate. Many farm managers do not know how much grain their farm has in storage, how much surplus grain there is, how much is supplied, and how much is consumed. There are many wasteful phenomena such as grain mildewing and livestock and poultry trampling on it.

One of the reasons for the hoarding and wasting of grain in farms is that the responsible comrades of the farms have departmentalism and blindly keep too much grain for their own units without considering actual needs. Another reason is that the farm management staff does not have a clear understanding of the supply of grain needed for living and the consumption of grain needed for production. There are no standards or the standards are too high, and the system is not strict. For example, in Fuyu County Farm, workers' families could take as much grain as they wanted in the past, and restrictions were only imposed in May; however, the standard is clearly too high, stipulating that adults receive 60 jin of rice per month and children receive 40 jin of rice per month. There are also many losses and wastes in grain storage and processing. For example, in Shangzhi County Demonstration Farm, the corn harvested from 18 hectares of land in 1954 (approximately 40,000 to 50,000 jin) was placed in the corn storage building without shucking, and no one ever turned it over or sun-dried it. It was only shucked at the end of March this year, and one-third was mildewed. Furthermore, a large area of 500 to 600 square meters in front of the corn storage building was scattered with many corn kernels, with an average of about one jin scattered per square meter. The phenomenon of hoarding and wasting grain in these farms is also closely related to the lack of strict inspection, supervision, and control by the county party committees and agricultural departments, and many farms are in a state of being unmanaged.

Farms are units that produce grain; however, like other state organs, they are not allowed to have any "privileges" in the use of grain. It cannot be considered that they can retain extra grain at will or waste it arbitrarily simply because they produced it themselves. Managers of state-owned farms in various regions must further recognize the great significance of saving grain and eliminating waste, overcome departmentalism, promptly hand over surplus grain to the state, and eliminate the phenomenon of loss and waste. Each farm should quickly check the amount of grain, stipulate reasonable consumption standards, and verify the required amount. At the same time, they should establish a system for receiving grain and supply the grain needed for production and the daily life of employees in a planned manner according to the fixed quota standard. They should also strengthen grain storage work, turn it over and dry it regularly to prevent mildew. Grain processing should improve the rice (flour) yield rate and reduce the broken rice and bran rate and loss rate. Leading comrades of the county party committees and agricultural departments should pay attention to this work and send special personnel to assist the farms in doing this work well.

    黑龙江各县农场不应积压和浪费粮食
    周海
    黑龙江省很多县的国营农场有严重的积压和浪费粮食的现象。据我们近几个月了解，仅鸡西、北安、宾县等三个农场就积压粮食达五万斤之多。全省一百多个农场积压多少呢，这是很难估量的。许多农场管理人员不知道自己的农场存粮多少、余粮多少、供应多少、消耗多少，粮食发霉、家畜家禽蹧蹋等浪费现象很多。
    农场积压和浪费粮食的原因之一，是农场负责同志有本位主义思想，不根据实际需要，给本单位盲目多留粮食。还有一个原因是农场管理工作人员心中无数，生活所需粮食的供应和生产所需粮食的消耗没有标准或标准过高，制度也不严。如富裕县农场，过去工人家属愿领多少粮食就领多少，从五月份才开始加以限制；但规定每月大人领六十斤米、小孩领四十斤米，标准显然过高。在粮食保管加工等方面也有不少损失和浪费。如尚志县示范农场，一九五四年在十八垧地上收获的玉米（约四、五万斤）没有扒皮就放在玉米楼子里，从来没人翻晒，到今年三月底才扒完，霉了三分之一；并且玉米楼子跟前有五、六百平方公尺大的地方抛撒了很多玉米粒子，平均一平方公尺的地方就抛撒了一斤左右。这些农场发生积压和浪费粮食的现象，同各县县委和农业部门对农场检查督监和控制不严也有密切的关系，许多农场处于没人管理的状态。
    农场是生产粮食的单位；可是，它同别的国家机关一样，在使用粮食方面决不容许有什么“特权”，不能认为是自己生产出来的自己就可以额外多留一些，就可以任意浪费。各地国营农场管理人员必须进一步认识节约粮食消灭浪费的重大意义，克服本位主义思想，把剩余粮食迅速交给国家，杜绝损失浪费的现象。各场应当赶快查清粮数，规定合理的消耗标准，核实需要量；同时，要建立起领取粮食的制度，按定量标准有计划地供应给本场生产上需要的和职工日常生活中需要的粮食；还要加强粮食保管工作，定时翻晒，防止发霉；粮食加工要提高出米（面）率，减少碎米和糠麸率、损失率。各县县委和农业部门的领导同志应当重视这项工作，并派专人协助农场把这项工作做好。
