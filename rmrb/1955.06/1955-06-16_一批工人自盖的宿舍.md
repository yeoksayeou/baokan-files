    A Batch of Dormitories Built by Workers Themselves
    Yang Jiamu
    Near the Yangjia Zhangzi Mining Bureau, there are hundreds of small houses built by the workers themselves. The walls of the small houses are made of stone, and the roofs are covered with five or six pieces of wood, then sorghum stalks, and finally yellow mud and white ash. These houses, if repaired once a year, can be lived in for twenty or thirty years, and each room (which can accommodate about four people) costs only seventy or eighty yuan. The workers are very satisfied with these houses because they are very suitable for their needs.
    Since liberation, the Yangjia Zhangzi Mining Bureau has developed rapidly, and the number of employees has increased a lot. In 1953 alone, more than two hundred new family dormitories and five large buildings for single workers were built, but still many people had no houses to live in. Many workers had to live in villages ten to thirty li away from the mining area. The mountain roads nearby are uneven, and it is inconvenient to ride bicycles. Every day, going to and from work, some walk twenty or thirty li, and some walk sixty li. Therefore, they cannot rest well, production cannot be improved, and learning is out of the question. Many workers' families live one hundred or even several hundred li away, and couples and children cannot meet for a long time, living separately and incurring large expenses. There are also many young men and women who have been in love for several years but cannot get married because they have no houses.
    If the state were to build dormitories, it would require a large investment to solve the problem.
    Now, some workers have solved the dormitory problem by themselves - building small houses. They pay for it themselves. Some use mutual aid methods to solve the problem. Those who are in extreme financial difficulty are lent a portion by the Mining Bureau, which is deducted in installments. The Mining Bureau uses its spare time to transport wood and stones for the workers by trucks and carts, without charging transportation fees. The land used is determined uniformly by the government. After the workers spend seventy or eighty yuan to build a house, they feel that there are many benefits in terms of life, production, and learning.
    Let us give two workers as examples.
    One is Chen Qingzheng, a sawyer in the lumberyard. His basic monthly salary is forty-two yuan. He has a wife and two children. In the past, he lived in a village twenty-five li away from the mining area, renting a room and paying seven yuan and five jiao in rent every month. He ate in the public canteen, which cost fifteen yuan a month. The rest was used for the family, and life was very difficult. Later, he sold his bicycle and borrowed some money from others. He spent his own time building a room and a half, and the whole family lived together. Expenses were reduced, life was not difficult, he was never late for work, and he was very enthusiastic about learning, with excellent results.
    The other is Lü Qinghai, a railway worker, with a family of four (two adults and two children), earning a monthly salary of forty-eight yuan. In the past, his wife and children lived in Xingcheng County, while he lived in a single dormitory, eating in the public canteen, which cost eighteen yuan a month. The remaining thirty yuan was used for the living expenses of his wife and children. In 1953, he built a room and a half himself. Now the four of them live together, spending eight yuan a month to buy two dou of sorghum rice and twenty-two yuan to buy vegetables and white flour. Life is very good. Lü Qinghai said: "In the past, even eating a piece of tofu required a lot of courage, but now eating dumplings is nothing!" Because monthly expenses are lower, he was able to make two new sets of bedding last year and also made new clothes. He is also very active in production. He said: "In the past, I often worried about family matters and could not concentrate my thoughts. Now I am at ease in production. I will work until the mine closes!"
    From the perspective of use, is it good to live in a small house? Compared with the flat-tiled dormitories built by the Mining Bureau, the workers' opinions are: First, the small houses are small and sunny, so they are warm in winter; the flat-tiled houses are tall and large, and burning a kang cannot solve the heating problem, so a stove must be used separately. Sometimes the houses even freeze, which is both expensive and not warm. Second, the small houses do not require rent, while the flat-tiled houses require rent. Third, if there are problems with the small houses, the workers can repair them themselves at any time; if the flat-tiled houses leak or the glass is broken, etc., the public needs to repair them, and the public spends a lot of repair costs. Fourth, it is easy to build small houses, and workers can have houses to live in quickly; building public dormitories is both expensive and time-consuming, and workers cannot live in them for a long time (too few are built). Fifth, the advantage of flat-tiled houses is that they are more beautiful and spacious; small houses are not beautiful enough.
    Compared from an investment perspective, the advantages of small houses are even more prominent: The Mining Bureau once spent 420,000 yuan to build 24 and a half flat-tiled houses, which could only accommodate 196 households, with an average construction cost of 2,142 yuan and nine jiao per household. If this 420,000 yuan were used to build small houses, it would be enough to house 4,802 households, and the money for the small houses is paid by the workers themselves, which is a great saving for the country.
    The workers see so many benefits of building small houses themselves, so when the leading staff of the Yangjia Zhangzi Mining Bureau decided to support the workers in building small houses themselves, many people registered with the Mining Bureau to apply. The workers said: "This is a good way to solve the housing difficulty!"

### 一批工人自盖的宿舍

    一批工人自盖的宿舍
    杨家木
    在杨家杖子矿务局附近，有几百间工人自己盖的小房子。小房子的墙是石头砌的，房顶用五、六根木头再盖上高粱秸，然后加上黄泥和白灰。这些房子，如果每年修理一次，可住二、三十年，每间（大约能住四个人）只化七、八十元。工人们住这些房子，非常满意，因为很适合他们的需要。
    杨家杖子矿务局解放以来发展很快，职工增加很多。一九五三年一次就新盖了二百多户家属宿舍、五幢给独身工人住的大楼，但仍然有许多人没房子住。很多工人只好住在离矿区十里以外三十里以内的村庄里。附近山路不平，骑自行车不方便。每天来回上、下班，少的走二、三十里，多的走六十里。因此，也就不能很好休息，生产搞不好，学习更谈不上了。还有很多工人家属住在一百里，甚至数百里以外，夫妇子女长期间不得见面，两下里过生活，开支很大。有一些青年男女，恋爱好几年，因为没房子而不能结婚的也不少。
    如果要国家建宿舍，就需要很大一笔投资才能解决问题。
    现在，有的工人自己想法解决了宿舍问题——自盖小房子。钱自己出。有的用互助的办法解决。经济十分困难的由矿务局借给一部分，分期扣还。矿务局利用业余时间用汽车、大车给工人搬运木材和石头，不收运费。使用的土地由政府统一确定。工人自己花七、八十元盖好房子后，在生活、生产和学习方面都感到有很多好处。
    让我们举两个工人做例子。
    一个是木材场火锯工陈清正。他每月的基本工资是四十二元。家里有妻子和两个小孩，过去住在离矿区二十五里的村子里，租一间房子，每月付房租七元五角。他在公共食堂吃饭，每个月要十五元，剩下的给家里用，生活是很困难的。后来他卖了自行车，又跟别人借一点钱，自己花工夫盖了一间半小房子，全家住在一起，开支小了，生活不困难了，一点不误工，学习也很起劲，成绩优良。
    另一个是铁道工吕清海，全家四口（两大两小），每月工资四十八元。过去妻子和孩子住在兴城县，他自己住在独身集体宿舍，在公共食堂吃饭，每月要十八元。余下的三十元作为妻子、孩子的生活费。一九五三年，他自己盖了一间半小房子。现在四个人在一起生活，每月用八元钱买两斗高粱米，用二十二元钱买菜和白面，生活就过得很不错。吕清海说：“过去吃块豆腐，都要狠一狠心，现在吃饺子也不觉得什么了！”因为每月支出少了，去年就能做两套新被褥，还做了新衣裳。生产也很积极。他说：“过去常惦念家里的事，思想不集中，现在安心生产了，矿山开到老，咱就干到老！”
    从使用上来说，住小房子好不好呢？跟矿务局盖的平瓦房宿舍比，工人的意见是：一、小房子面积小，向阳，所以冬天暖和；平瓦房高大，烧炕不能解决采暖问题，还要另生炉子，有时候房子里还要结冰，既费钱又不暖和。二、小房子不出房租，住平瓦房出房钱。三、小房子有毛病，工人自己随时可以修理；平瓦房子如漏雨、玻璃被打碎等等，都需要公家修理，公家花的修理费很大。四、盖小房子容易，工人很快就有房子住；盖公共宿舍既费钱又费时间，工人长期住不上（盖得太少）。五、平瓦房的优点是较漂亮、宽敞；小房子则不够美观。
    从投资上来比，小房子的好处就更突出了：矿务局曾用四十二万元盖过二十四幢半平瓦房，只能住一百九十六户，平均每户需要建筑费二千一百四十二元零九角。如果这四十二万元来盖小房子，就可以盖够四千八百零二户住的，况且小房子的钱又是工人自己出的，对国家来说，就是很大的节约。
      工人们看到自盖小房子有这么多好处，所以当杨家杖子矿务局的领导工作人员决定支持工人自盖小房子时，许多人都向矿务局登记申请。工人们说：“这是解决宿舍困难的好办法！”
