    The first batch of complete die sets for the automotive industry has been produced in the die workshop of the First Automobile Works. Since some of the workshop's equipment entered experimental production in February, it has produced a batch of small and medium-sized die sets.

    Dies are molds for stamped products, including cold stamping dies and hot forging dies. With dies, heated steel materials can be forged into complex products such as crankshafts. More than 3,000 parts in a car are produced using dies. Using dies to stamp various parts is highly efficient and can meet the needs of mass automobile production. The die workshop of the First Automobile Works will undertake the production of all the dies required by the entire factory.

    第一汽车厂制出首批成套冲模
    汽车工业用的首批成套的冲模，已经在第一汽车制造厂冲模车间生产出来。这个车间的部分设备从二月份进入试验性生产以来，已经生产出一批中小型冲模。
    冲模是冲压产品的模子，包括冷冲模和热锻模两种。靠着冲模，加热的钢料能被锻制出形状复杂的曲轴等产品，汽车上有三千多个零件是利用冲模生产出来的。用冲模冲压各种零件的生产效率很高，能适应大量生产汽车的需要。第一汽车制造厂冲模车间将担负全厂需用的全部冲模的生产任务。
