    Goodbye, Indonesia!
    April 28, Thursday
    Today, the Chinese delegation is leaving Jakarta, leaving Indonesia.

    At eight o'clock in the morning, the members of the Chinese delegation, led by Premier Zhou Enlai, went to the Independence Palace to bid farewell to President Sukarno. From Majapahit Street in front of the embassy to Independence Street in front of the presidential palace, it was again filled with cheering crowds.

    They waited until they saw President Sukarno escort the distinguished guests out of the Independence Palace.

    At Kemayoran Airport, a piece of news that everyone had been waiting for for a long time was confirmed: after two days of talks, the Prime Ministers of China and Indonesia had decided to issue a joint statement. It will be signed now.

    The reception room at the airport has been specially decorated. A red carpet was laid on the floor, and stationery was placed on an oval table, including writing brushes and inkstones.

    At 8:45, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo sat on either side of the table and signed their names on the Chinese and Indonesian texts of the joint statement, respectively.

    In this joint statement, "The two Prime Ministers reiterated that they will work together to realize the common aspirations affirmed by the Asian-African Conference and the declaration adopted to promote world peace and cooperation."

    "The two Prime Ministers expressed satisfaction that China and Indonesia, as good neighbors, live together peacefully on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit."...

    "The two Prime Ministers agreed that the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia should maintain close cooperation to continue to strengthen mutual understanding and friendly relations between the two countries."

    After the signing, the two Prime Ministers shook hands and congratulated each other.

    The people around them greeted the birth of this document, which is of great historical significance not only for the friendship between the two countries but also for world peace, with warm applause.

    The time for parting had arrived, and members of the Chinese delegation distributed a written statement by Premier Zhou Enlai to the reporters present.

    The statement said: "Although the visit of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Republic of Indonesia was very short, it has left a very deep impression. The enthusiasm and wisdom of the Indonesian people and their friendship with the Chinese people will always remain in our memory."

    The national anthems of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia were played at the airport. Premier Zhou Enlai is now standing on the reviewing stand.

    At this solemn moment, many emotions filled people's hearts.

    At 9:15, the engine roared, and the plane sped across the runway and took off.

    Looking out from the window, inside and outside the airport, there was a sea of people, and countless hands were still waving non-stop in the sky.

    The plane turned around, and the red roofs and lush palm trees of Jakarta reappeared under the wings, and the yellow Ciliwung River occasionally emitted a silvery flash.

    Then there was a crescent-shaped beach, and then a string of islands stretching out from the sea like a string of pearls.

    The land of Indonesia has disappeared from our eyes, but the memory of her will remain in our hearts for a long time. (The End)

    人民的心同亚非会议在一起

    再见，印度尼西亚！
    四月二十八日　星期四
    今天，中国代表团要离开雅加达，离开印度尼西亚了。
    早晨八点钟，以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团团员们到独立宫向苏加诺总统辞行。从大使馆前的马渣加达街到总统府前的独立街又已经站满了欢送的人群。
    他们一直等到看着苏加诺总统把贵宾们送出独立宫。
    在玛腰兰机场上，大家等待了很久的一项消息得到了证实：在两天的会谈之后，中国、印度尼西亚两国总理已决定要发表一个联合声明。它要在现在签字。
    机场的接待室里已经作了特别的布置。地下铺了红色的地毯，一张椭圆形的大桌子上摆好了文具，其中有毛笔和砚台。
    八点四十五分，周恩来总理和沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理在桌子的两边就座，在联合声明的中国、印度尼西亚文本上分别签下了自己的名字。
    在这个联合声明中，“两国总理重申，他们将共同努力以实现亚非会议所肯定的共同愿望和所通过的促进世界和平和合作的宣言。”
    “两国总理对于中国和印度尼西亚两国在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利的原则的基础上作为良好的邻邦和平相处，表示满意。”………………
    “两国总理同意，中华人民共和国、印度尼西亚共和国两国应保持亲密合作，以继续加强两国间的相互了解和友好关系。”
    签字完毕了，两位总理互相握手道贺。
    周围的人们以热烈的鼓掌来迎接这一个不但对两国友谊而且对世界和平都有重大历史意义的文件的诞生。
    临别的时候已到，中国代表团人员向在场的记者们散发了周恩来总理的书面谈话。
    这个谈话说：“中华人民共和国代表团这次访问印度尼西亚共和国的时间虽然很短，但是得到了极深刻的印象。印度尼西亚人民的热情和智慧和他们对中国人民的友情，将会永远留在我们的记忆里。”
    机场上响起了中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国国歌。周恩来总理现在是站在检阅台上。
    在这肃静的一刻，许多感情充塞在人们的心里。
    九点一刻，马达响了，飞机从跑道上急驰而过，腾空而起。
    从窗口看出去，机场内外，黑压压一片人海，无数的手还在向天空不停的挥。
    飞机转过身来，雅加达的一片片红色的屋顶和棕榈树的浓荫又在翅膀下面出现，黄色的朱农沙里河，偶然发出银色的闪光。
    然后是像一片像新月那样弯着的海滩，然后是像一串珍珠那样从海面上伸展出去的岛群。
    印度尼西亚的土地从我们眼里消失了，但是对于她的记忆将长留在我们的心中。  （完）
