This spring, members of the Gongnong Lianmeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xijia Township, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, argued over who got to use the good livestock, nearly coming to blows. The cooperative committee members thought: the whole cooperative of nine teams only has one horse, the rest are oxen and donkeys, so to stop people from fighting, they should take turns using them. But, even more problems arose with this rotation system. One team used it for a day, and then it was nine days before it was their turn again; when their turn came, they all wanted the horse to do more work. From then on, the horse's burden got heavier and heavier, and sometimes it wouldn't eat grass because it was being used too much. The person feeding the livestock often argued with the teams. Although they were processing and adding feed, the horse still got thinner and thinner every day. This became the cooperative committee's biggest headache. The cooperative committee researched several times, but couldn't come up with a solution. Later, the cooperative director came up with a solution: sell the horse and buy donkeys instead. However, things weren't as simple as the director imagined. After selling the horse, everyone had no horse to fight over, but then they started fighting over the big black donkey, because besides the horse, the big black donkey was the best.

There were eighteen heads of public livestock and twenty-seven heads of draft animals rented from cooperative members in this cooperative. Among these livestock, there were oxen and donkeys, good ones and bad ones. Among the thirty-one donkeys, there were six old donkeys and one small donkey, which could only plow one mu of land per day, twenty-four strong donkeys, which could plow more than two to three mu of land a day; especially the big black donkey, which ran fast and was easy to use. Using good livestock saved effort and allowed more work to be done, while using bad livestock resulted in less work and more hardship, so everyone wanted to use donkeys, and didn't want to use oxen, especially the "big black donkey." In 1954, plowing was recorded by *xiang*, regardless of how much was plowed, and the problem was temporarily solved by adopting a lottery system for distributing livestock. However, this year, after implementing the fixed quota piecework system, the lottery system for distributing livestock didn't work. Because the fixed quota piecework system records work based on the amount of work done and the quality, everyone wanted to use good livestock in order to earn more work points. Therefore, everyone fought even harder for good livestock, seriously hindering spring plowing production and the unity of the cooperative members.

After repeated research by the cooperative committee and the members' congress, and after visiting and learning from neighboring agricultural cooperatives, they formulated a method of using livestock that was compatible with the labor quota piecework system.

First, based on the tillage ability of each livestock, with reference to the tillage situation in previous years, compare oxen with oxen, donkeys with donkeys, and then compare oxen with donkeys, and classify the livestock. Based on the specific situation that oxen are not as fast as donkeys, and donkeys are not as strong and durable as oxen, a base score was assessed. Two principles were established: the highest difference between equal ranks cannot exceed two points; a first-class donkey is one point higher than a first-class ox, and a fourth-class donkey and a third-class ox have the same base score.

Secondly, on the basis of grading and scoring the draft animals, a quota was set based on the standard of the amount of work that a medium-sized livestock can do in one day. The method for setting the quota is: first find a medium-sized livestock as a standard, and based on past tillage experience and field experiments, determine the amount that a standard livestock should do in one day for various tasks, and derive the amount of work done per base point; then calculate the amount of work that each livestock should do in one day based on its base score. Because livestock of the same rank are not exactly the same, after calculating the quota, comparisons and evaluations were made, adjustments were made, and finally the plan was finalized. Because this year is a preliminary experiment, and there is not yet rich experience, some tasks still need to be tested in actual practice in the future, so only the quotas for plowing, sowing (plowing and sowing, harrowing and sowing), carting, and delivering manure have been stipulated for now. For example, for plowing: a first-class donkey plows two mu of remote land, three mu of nearby land, and two and a half mu of medium land per day; a second-class donkey and a first-class ox plow one and a half mu of remote land, two and a half mu of nearby land, and two mu of medium land per day. In specific application, it is also necessary to refer to soil quality, past tillage conditions, and how much labor is spent this year.

After implementing this method, each production team requested a reasonable allocation of livestock. Therefore, it was decided to fix the livestock in each team according to the team's land and the base score of each livestock. However, the cooperative has public livestock and private livestock, and some teams have more private livestock than they should be allocated, while some teams have none or only one or two private draft animals. This requires appropriate allocation of all public and private livestock in the cooperative. However, many cooperative members were afraid that their livestock would be injured if they were transferred to other teams, and some cooperative members believed that adjusting livestock meant collectivization, and seven households wanted to sell their livestock because they were afraid of collectivization. To this end, ideological education of collectivism was conducted among the members, enlightening everyone to recognize the benefits of adjusting livestock for the cooperative's development of production and increased income, which would benefit the cooperative and themselves. On the basis of improved ideological awareness, two specific issues of renting private livestock from members were also resolved: one was to determine the rental price of private livestock. The handling method is to adhere to the principle of mutual benefit, and under the principle of being slightly lower than the market price of renting livestock (because the livestock rented by the cooperative must also cultivate on the land of the livestock owner who joined the cooperative), first evaluate the annual rental price of medium-sized livestock, then calculate the rental price per base point, and use this to estimate the rental price of each livestock. In order to truly achieve fairness and rationality, the rental price of each livestock calculated is then evaluated by the masses, and finally the plan is finalized. The second is to assess the value of the livestock. In order to relieve the members' ideological concerns, all private livestock rented by the members were priced at market prices, and compensation methods for death and injury were stipulated. From then on, the phenomenon of not wanting the cooperative to use livestock and wanting to sell livestock disappeared, and the allocation of livestock was carried out smoothly, and eight cooperative members increased their investment and bought livestock.

After stipulating the livestock tillage quota and fixing the livestock in each team, everyone no longer grabbed livestock. However, some cooperative members still rushed to work, regardless of the livestock's fatigue, in order to earn more labor days or to make time to do private work. Li Zhengming was late to plow, rushed to plow hard, and finished work late, plowing three more *fen* of land, resulting in the ox not eating grass. Some cooperative members only cared for their own or their relatives' and neighbors' private livestock, and did not care for public livestock. Shen Gengmao pulled only three loads of manure per cart with his private livestock, and four or five loads per cart with public livestock. In order to ensure the health of the draft animals, education on loving and protecting livestock was conducted among the members, and the behavior of Li Zhengming and others who did not care for draft animals was criticized according to the cooperative's regulations. From then on, the cooperative stipulated two more systems for protecting draft animals: no work points will be added for exceeding the quota for using livestock; anyone who damages livestock for no reason, whether public or private, will be punished according to the cooperative's regulations, and in serious cases, they will be required to compensate for the loss.

After implementing these methods, not only were many shortcomings in the management and use of draft animals overcome and the potential of draft animals was fully utilized, but also the difficulty of lacking draft animals was overcome, and many contradictions between private and public use were reduced. Households with livestock no longer worried about their livestock being misused by others. For example, Feng Xiaotu's little gray donkey quickly became thin after being rented to the cooperative due to overuse; many households with livestock dared not rent them to the cooperative. After implementing the new method, the donkey quickly recovered. Cooperative members with livestock saw that renting livestock to the cooperative was profitable and safe, and were willing to rent their livestock to the cooperative for use.

    农业合作社合理使用耕畜的好办法
    方中谷  海英
    今年春季，山西屯留县西贾乡工农联盟农业生产合作社的社员因为争着用好牲口发生了争吵，几乎打起架来。社务委员们认为：全社九个组只有一匹马，别的都是牛和驴，要想使大家不争抢，只有轮流使用。可是，轮流使用中发生的问题更多。一个组用一天，九天才轮到一次；轮到了的时候都想让马多做些活。从此，马的负担一天比一天重起来，有时因为被使用得过度就不吃草了。喂牲口的人同各组常常争吵。虽然加工加料喂养，但是马还是一天比一天瘦。这成了社务委员最苦恼的问题。社务委员会经过几次研究，总没有想出解决的办法。后来，社长想出了一个解决办法；把马卖掉换买成驴。可是，事情不像社长想像的那么简单。卖掉马以后，大家无马可争了，又争起那头大黑驴来了，因为除了马就数大黑驴好。
    这个社里有公共牲口十八头，租用社员私有耕畜二十七头。这些牲口中间，有牛又有驴，有好的也有坏的。三十一头驴当中有六头老驴和一头小驴，每天只能耕一亩多地，二十四头壮驴，一天就能耕地二亩多到三亩多；特别是大黑驴，跑的快，使着又顺手。使用好牲口省力气又能多做活，使用坏牲口做活少还得受累，因此，谁都想使用驴，不愿使用牛，尤其想使用“大黑驴”。一九五四年耕地按晌记工，耕多耕少一样记工，采取抽签分配牲口的办法，把这个问题暂时解决了。可是，今年实行了定额计件制以后，抽签分配牲口的办法行不通了。因为定额计件是按做活多少和质量好坏记工，所以大家都想使用好牲口，以便多得工分。因此，大家争好牲口争得更厉害了，严重地妨碍了春耕生产和社员间的团结。
    经过社务委员会、社员大会多次研究，并且到邻近的农业合作社访问学习，他们制定了同劳动定额计件制相适应的使用牲口办法。
    首先，根据各个牲口的耕作能力，参照往年耕作情况，把牛同牛对比，驴同驴对比，再把牛驴相互对比，把牲口分出等类。根据牛行动不如驴快、驴不如牛力气大耐用的具体情况，评出底分。确定了两个原则：等和等之间最高不能差二分；一等驴比一等牛高一分，四等驴和三等牛底分一样。
    其次，在耕畜分了等评了分的基础上，以用一个中常牲口一天所能做的活做标准，规定定额。定额的方法是：先找出一头中常牲口做标准，根据往年的耕作经验和实地试验，定出用一个标准牲口做各种活一天应做的数量，从中得出每一底分做活数；再按各个牲口的底分计算，就求出了用各个牲口一天应做的各种活的定额。因为同一等牲口也不完全一样，所以在计算出定额以后，又作了对比和评议，进行了调整，最后才定案。因为今年是初步试验，还没有丰富的经验，有些活还待今后在实际做的当中试验，所以现在只规定了犁地、下种（犁种、耧种）、拉车、送粪等几项活的定额。如犁地：一等驴一天犁远地二亩，近地三亩，中地二亩半；二等驴和一等牛一天犁远地一亩半，近地二亩半，中地二亩。在具体运用时，还要参照土质、往年耕作情况、今年费工多少等条件。
    实行了这个办法以后，各个生产组都要求合理地分配牲口。因此，决定根据各个组的土地和每头牲口的底分把牲口固定在各个组里。但是，社里有公共牲口，又有私有牲口，有些组只是私有牲口就比应分配到的牲口还多，有的组没有或者只有一两头私有耕畜。这就需要把全社公有和私有的牲口作适当的调配。可是，有不少社员怕把他的牲口调到别组去使伤了，有的社员认为调整牲口就是归公，有七户因为怕归公要卖牲口。为此，对社员进行了集体主义的思想教育，启发大家认识调整牲口对全社发展生产、增加收入的好处，对社对自己都有利益。在思想觉悟提高的基础上，还解决了租用社员私有牲口的两个具体问题：一是确定私有牲口的租价。处理办法是掌握互利原则，在稍低于租用牲口市价的原则下（因为社里租用的牲口也要在牲口主人的入社的土地上耕作），先评定中常牲口一年的租价，再求出每一底分的租价，以此推算各个牲口的租价。为了真正达到公平合理，在推算出来各个牲口的租价后再经群众评议，最后定案。二是评定牲口的价值。为了解除社员的思想顾虑，所有租用社员的私有牲口，都按市价评了价，并订出了死伤时的赔偿办法。从此，不愿让社里使用牲口和要卖牲口的现象都没有了，顺利地进行了牲口的调配，有八户社员还增加投资买了牲口。
    规定了牲口耕作定额和把牲口固定在各组以后，大家不再抢牲口了。但是，有些社员为了多赚劳动日，或者为了赶出时间来做私人的活，仍然不顾牲口的疲累，赶工做活。李正明在耕地时去的迟、赶的紧、收工晚，多耕了三分地，结果牛不吃草了。还有的社员只爱护他自己或亲戚邻居的私有牲口，不爱护公共牲口。申更茂用他私有牲口送粪一车只拉三担，用公共牲口一车就拉四、五担。为了保证耕畜健壮，在社员中进行了爱畜保畜教育，根据社章规定批评了李正明等不爱护耕畜的行为。从这以后，社里又规定了两条爱护耕畜的制度：使用牲口做活超额不加工分；无故损伤牲口，不论公共的或私有的，都要依社章给予处分，严重的要包赔损失。
    实行了这些办法以后，不仅克服了对耕畜管理、使用上的许多缺点和充分发挥了耕畜的潜在力，并且克服了缺乏耕畜的困难，同时减少了私有公用间的许多矛盾，有牲口户也不再耽心自己的牲口要被别人使坏的问题了。如冯小秃的小灰驴，租入社后，由于使用过度，很快就瘦了；许多有牲口户都不敢租给社里了。实行新办法以后，这个驴很快就复原了。有牲口的社员们看到租给社牲口有利又保险，都愿意把牲口租给社里使用。
