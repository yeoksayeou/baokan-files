If mankind can coexist peacefully according to the Five Principles, there will be no more wars.

	Zhang Wentian said that the spirit of the Five Principles has been accepted by more and more countries with different political and social systems, which is a major historical event in the current international arena. The Five Principles so clearly express the common demands and common aspirations of the people of all countries in the world at this stage, therefore, these principles have great vitality and have become an irresistible trend in modern international relations. We should continue to contribute our strength to make the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence more universally applied in international relations, and to make these principles play a greater role.
