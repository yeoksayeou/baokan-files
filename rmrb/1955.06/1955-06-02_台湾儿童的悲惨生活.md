According to accusations from people who returned from Taiwan and information revealed by Taiwanese newspapers, the vast majority of Taiwanese children are living miserable lives under the oppression of American invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

The tragic incidents of Taiwanese parents being forced to sell their sons and daughters due to their inability to survive are becoming increasingly common. According to statistics from Chiang's female organization at the end of December 1951 alone, there were already more than 125,000 people in Taiwan who had been sold as "adopted daughters." The lives of these "adopted daughters" are extremely miserable. Seven out of ten prostitutes in Taiwan are "adopted daughters" who have been forced into prostitution. It is a common tragedy in Taiwan that "adopted daughters" are beaten to death or injured by traffickers and "adoptive parents" for refusing to become prostitutes. Zhong Qingshui, a farmer in Nantou County, Taiwan, sold his 11-year-old daughter, Zhong Yuemei, to someone as an "adopted daughter" in January of this year because he could not make a living. In the past few months, Zhong Yuemei has been forced to engage in heavy labor by her "adoptive parents," often fainting due to exhaustion, and has been subjected to various tortures such as hanging and branding, leaving her covered in scars. Chen Yuejiao, a girl from Hsinchu County, was beaten to death by her "adoptive mother" in January of this year. Zeng Jinque, a 13-year-old girl from Pingtung County, committed suicide by drowning on April 4 of this year because she could not bear the hard labor, beatings, kicking, hunger, and starvation she was subjected to day and night. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique not only does not interfere with these inhumane acts of abuse against "adopted daughters," but instead formulates some "laws" and clauses to maintain the criminal "adopted daughter" system.

There are also tens of thousands of orphans in Taiwan who are homeless, wandering, and begging everywhere. In the streets and alleys of Taipei, Keelung, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Tainan, many orphans and poor children are crowded around garbage dumps every day, rummaging for watermelon rinds, banana peels, and bones to use as food. Some orphans starve to death on the streets.

The lives of the children of the vast majority of working people in Taiwan who have not become "adopted daughters" or "orphans" are also shockingly miserable. These children live a life of not having enough to eat or wear, and many of them have to "earn a living" and help their parents from the age of seven or eight. Taiwan's towns and cities are filled with children selling things as hawkers: selling cigarettes and sweets, selling fried dough sticks, selling newspapers, selling lottery tickets, shining shoes, collecting scraps... From dawn to dusk, the streets and alleys of various towns and cities are often filled with various miserable cries of vendors. A hawking song called "Collecting Wine Bottles" says: "I am a sixteen-year-old child, and my parents have been very poor since I was young; in order to make a living, I don't dare to be lazy, and I go out to collect wine bottles every day. Is there any wine bottles to sell? Are there any scrap copper, scrap iron, and waste paper to sell?"

Family poverty prevents many Taiwanese children from attending school, making them illiterate. According to figures published by Chiang's education authorities alone, more than 374,000 Taiwanese children are out of school. According to a survey in Wai-pu Township, Taichung County, the proportion of school-age children out of school in the area is 68 percent. Most of the school buildings in Taiwan are old and dilapidated, and the better classrooms are mostly occupied by Chiang's troops and Chiang's agencies. In Yilan County, more than 14,000 elementary school students do not have classrooms and have to attend classes in the open air.

Taiwanese children in schools are subjected to the poison of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. They are forced to read various reactionary pamphlets that Chiang has stipulated as "required reading." Chiang also forces Taiwanese middle school students to participate in organizations controlled by the secret service chief Chiang Ching-kuo, and elementary school students are also forced to participate in the "Boy Scouts." In addition to being forced to receive military training, Chiang's troops even coerce some junior high school students aged fourteen or fifteen to serve as cannon fodder. Taiwanese students are also forced to engage in various fundraising and "comforting" activities for Chiang's troops, forcing them to abandon their formal studies. Some parents once wrote to a Taiwanese magazine saying that watching their children receive such an education was like "suffering torture," and therefore they felt "deeply worried."

Every year, American imperialism also imports more than 400 films into Taiwan, such as "Iron Arm Star," "Hell Gate," "Garden of Sin," and "A Dream of Red Mansions," which promote murder, robbery, rape, mythology, and all kinds of decadent "American lifestyles," and a large number of American yellow pictorials, novels, and comic books are dumped, causing many Taiwanese children to be corrupted and take the path of crime.

The reactionary rulers also often directly kill Taiwanese children. Among the Taiwanese patriots imprisoned in Chiang's Green Island concentration camp, some are only sixteen or seventeen years old, and they are being tortured by Chiang. In Taipei City, a Chiang's military officer shot and killed a shoeshine boy with a pistol simply because the child asked him for money after shining his shoes. In Keelung City, a child was drowned in the sea by an American soldier who committed a crime while drunk. There are also many Taiwanese children who have been sacrificed under the wheels of American and Chiang's military vehicles that rush around. Recently, in Caoshan, American Colonel Davidson drove his car and crushed He Zhengxian, a child of only six years old, to death and left without regard, arousing the indignation of local residents.

Taiwanese children hate American invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. During the "February 28th" uprising in 1947, when Taiwanese compatriots held anti-American and anti-Chiang protests, many Taiwanese teenagers bravely participated in the struggle. In April of this year, a teenager in Taipei City angrily bit off the finger of a Chiang's policeman who was forcibly demolishing his house. Taiwanese children in deep water and scorching fire are yearning for the day when the American invaders are driven away and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is eliminated.

    台湾儿童的悲惨生活
    新华社记者　古凡
    根据台湾归来的人的控诉和台湾报纸透露的消息，广大的台湾儿童正在美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团的摧残下，过着悲惨的生活。
    台湾的父母们由于无法生活而被迫卖儿卖女的惨事愈来愈多。仅据蒋贼妇女机关在一九五一年十二月底的统计，当时全台湾被卖作“养女”的已有十二万五千多人。这些“养女”的生活是非常辛酸的。台湾的娼妓在十人中有七人是被迫进火坑的“养女”。“养女”拒绝充当娼妓以致被人贩子和“养父母”打死打伤，是台湾常常发生的惨事。台湾南投县农民钟清水因无法生活，在今年一月把十一岁的女儿锺月美卖给人家作“养女”，几个月来，锺月美被“养父母”强迫从事粗重操作，以致常常因体力不支而昏倒，并多次被施用吊打、火烙等酷刑，以致满身伤痕。新竹县女童陈月娇在今年一月间被“养母”打死。屏东县十三岁的女童曾金雀，因不堪终日操作苦役、遭受拳打脚踢和捱饥忍饿，在今年四月四日投水自杀。蒋介石卖国集团对这些虐待“养女”的惨无人道的行为不但不加过问，反而制定了一些“法律”条文来维护罪恶的“养女”制度。
    台湾还有几万名无依无靠的孤儿，到处飘泊流浪和行乞。在台北、基隆、高雄、台中和台南等地的大街小巷的垃圾堆旁，每天都拥挤着很多孤儿和贫苦儿童，在翻找西瓜皮、香蕉皮和骨头等充当食物。有些孤儿被饿死在街头。
    未沦为“养女”和“孤儿”的台湾广大劳动人民的子女，他们的生活的悲惨也令人触目惊心。这些儿童过着吃不饱、穿不暖的生活，许多人从七、八岁起就要自己“谋生”和帮助父母生活。台湾各市镇充满了做小贩的儿童，卖香烟糖果的，卖油条的，卖报纸的，卖奖券的，擦皮鞋的，收买破烂的，……从清晨到深夜，各市镇的街巷常常散布着各种凄惨的叫卖声。一首叫卖的歌谣“收酒干（瓶）”说：“我是十六岁的小儿童，从小父母就很穷；为了生活不敢偷懒，每天出去收酒干。有酒干卖吗？有破铜烂铁废纸卖吗？”
    家庭的贫困使许多台湾儿童无法入学，成为文盲。仅据蒋贼教育机关发表的数字，台湾儿童失学的有三十七万四千多人。据台中县外浦乡的调查，当地学龄儿童失学的占了百分之六十八。台湾各地的校舍大都年久失修，破破烂烂，较好的课室又多被蒋贼军和蒋贼机关占用。宜兰县有一万四千多名小学生没有课室而露天上课。
    台湾少年儿童在学校中受尽蒋介石卖国集团的荼毒，他们被迫阅读蒋贼规定“必读”的各种反动小册子。蒋贼还强令台湾的中学生参加由特务头子蒋经国控制的组织，小学生也被迫参加“童子军”。台湾少年儿童除了被迫接受军事训练外，蒋贼军甚至胁迫一些十四五岁的初中学生充当炮灰。台湾学生并且被迫从事各种募捐和“慰劳”蒋贼军等活动，使正式课业都被迫丢荒。曾经有几个学生家长向一家台湾杂志投书说，眼看自己子女接受这样的教育，等于“受着苦刑”，因而“不胜痛切忧虑”。
    美帝国主义每年还向台湾输入四百多部什么
  “铁臂煞星”“地狱门”“罪恶之园”“风月宝鉴”等宣传凶杀、抢劫、强奸、神怪以及各种各样腐朽堕落的“美国生活方式”的电影，和大量倾销美国黄色的画报、小说和小人书等，使许多台湾儿童受到腐蚀而走上犯罪的途径。
    反动的统治者还常常直接杀害台湾少年儿童。被囚禁在蒋贼火烧岛集中营的台湾爱国者中，有些是才十六七岁的少年，他们在受着蒋贼酷刑的折磨。在台北市，一个蒋贼军官用手枪把一名擦鞋儿童打死，只是因为擦鞋后这个儿童向他要钱。基隆市一个儿童被美军借醉行凶，抛进海里淹死。还有很多台湾儿童牺牲在横冲直撞的美军和蒋贼军的军车轮下。最近，在草山，美军上校戴维生驾车辗死了年仅六岁的小孩何政宪后不顾而去，激起当地居民的愤慨。
    台湾少年儿童痛恨美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团。在一九四七年台湾同胞举行反美反蒋的“二·二八”起义时，许多台湾少年英勇地参加了斗争的行列。在今年四月间，台北市一少年愤怒地咬断了强拆他家的房屋的一名蒋贼警察的手指。水深火热中的台湾少年儿童，渴望着赶走美国侵略者、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的日子的来临。
