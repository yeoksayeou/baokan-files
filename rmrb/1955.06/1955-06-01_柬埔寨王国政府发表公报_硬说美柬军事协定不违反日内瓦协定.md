Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 30th: Phnom Penh dispatch: The Cambodian Royal Government issued an official communiqué on the 29th stating that the military aid agreement recently signed with the United States "does not involve the concession of military bases, nor is it a military alliance or the dispatch of American instructors to Cambodia." Therefore, the communiqué believes that this military agreement "conforms" to the Geneva Accords.

The Cambodian Royal Government has never disclosed the details of this military agreement signed on May 16th. According to a statement issued by the U.S. State Department, the agreement also "stipulates the establishment of a U.S. military aid advisory group in Cambodia," measures that clearly cannot be considered consistent with the final declaration of the Geneva Conference and the declaration of the Cambodian Royal Government.

According to Agence France-Presse, the Cambodian government issued this communiqué in response to recent accusations made by the progressive opposition. These accusations, published in five newspapers in Phnom Penh, stated that the military agreement is a surrender of the kingdom's sovereignty.

    柬埔寨王国政府发表公报
    硬说美柬军事协定不违反日内瓦协定
    新华社河内三十日电　金边消息：柬埔寨王国政府在二十九日发表正式公报说，柬埔寨政府最近同美国签订的军事援助协定，“毫不牵涉到出让军事基地的问题，也不是军事同盟和派遣美国教官到柬埔寨的问题”。因此，公报认为，这个军事协定“符合”于日内瓦协定。
    柬埔寨王国政府从未公布这个在五月十六日签订的军事协定的细节。根据美国国务院发表的声明，这个协定还“规定在柬埔寨成立一个美国军事援助顾问团”，这些措施显然不能被认为是同日内瓦会议最后宣言和柬埔寨王国政府声明相符合的。
    据法新社说，柬埔寨政府发表这个公报是为了答复进步的反对派最近提出的指责。在金边五家报纸上刊登的这种指责说，这个军事协定是放弃王国主权。
