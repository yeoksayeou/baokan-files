To the Editors:

The Yakeshi Ranch in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was established in 1954 and its operation and management are very poor. Since its establishment, a total of 64 adult cattle, 144 strong cattle and calves, and 10 work horses have died, with preliminary estimated losses exceeding 7,000 yuan.

The management of this ranch is extremely chaotic. The ranch's production tools have never had any management system. They are often replaced when broken, claimed when lost, and bought when unavailable. There is not even an accounting ledger in the warehouse.

There is a lack of clear responsibilities in personnel assignments, resulting in overstaffing. The idle are idle to death, and the busy are exhausted. Serious dereliction of duty is also not dealt with. The ranch's veterinarians often sit in the treatment room and are unwilling to go into the pens. The mortality rate of calves in the first quarter of 1955 was as high as 24 percent, but the ranch's veterinarians did not propose any measures. The workers' labor discipline is very poor, and phenomena such as lateness, early departure, loafing, and work stoppages are also common.

Yakeshi is a famous place with lush water and grass. The Yakeshi Ranch bears the important responsibility of guiding the decentralized animal husbandry in pastoral areas to gradually move towards collectivization. However, the work of this ranch is not done well. Herdsmen reflect: If Yakeshi Ranch continues like this, the cattle will soon die out, and the capital will be lost. How can it play an exemplary role? I suggest that the state's supervisory authorities conduct a prompt inspection and handling of Yakeshi Ranch.

    牙克石牧场要改进经营管理编辑同志：
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟牙克石牧场是在一九五四年成立的，经营管理得很不好。从建场到现在共死亡大牛六十四头、壮牛和犊牛一百四十四头、役马十匹，初步估计损失在七千元以上。
    这个牧场的管理工作上十分混乱。牧场的生产用具从来没有任何管理制度，常常坏了就换，丢了就领，没有就买，仓库里连一本账册也没有。
    在人事分工上职责不清，人浮于事。闲的闲死，忙的累死，严重失职的也无人处理。牧场的兽医人员经常坐在治疗室内，不肯深入圈棚。一九五五年第一季度犊牛的死亡率高达百分之二十四强，但牧场的兽医人员没有提出任何措施。工人的劳动纪律很差，迟到、早退、怠工和窝工等现象也很普遍。
    牙克石是有名的水草肥美的地方。牙克石牧场，是在牧区担负着引导分散的畜牧业逐步走向集体化道路的重大责任的，然而这个牧场的工作做得不好。牧民反映说：照牙克石牧场这样子干下去，牛快死光了，本也赔完了，怎样还能起示范作用呢？我建议国家的监察机关对牙克石牧场迅速作一次检查和处理。　　　　宋复生
