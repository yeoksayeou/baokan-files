Actively Improve the Technical Work of the Fuel Industry

Wang Jinlin, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Fuel Industry

From 1950 to 1954, the state allocated more than 6,000 university and college students to the fuel industry sector, and more than 5,000 graduates from secondary technical schools under the Ministry of Fuel Industry joined the workforce. The proportion of mechanized mining has also increased daily, and many regulations and systems have been formulated in coal, electricity, and petroleum, so that many tasks have established procedures to follow. Therefore, it should be said that the technical strength of the fuel industry has grown.

However, the fuel industry has developed even faster. Coal and electricity production have both increased twofold, oil production has increased nearly sevenfold, and the scale of capital construction has expanded year by year. Among the construction units above the quota, more than fifty projects will be completed or partially completed this year. Compared with this need, the technical strength is still insufficient, and the technical leadership appears weak.

After the proposal of "putting capital construction in the first place" at the end of 1952, in order to meet the needs of capital construction development, a large number of technical personnel were transferred from the original factories and mines to enrich the geology, design, and construction departments, and the technical personnel of the original production factories and mines were greatly reduced. Some factories and mines did not even have an engineer, and were supported in production by some new university graduates; many important production positions had to be taken care of by apprentices. Their experience was insufficient, and they often became flustered when encountering abnormal situations, which expanded accidents and affected the improvement of equipment utilization and product quality. In 1954, due to changes in geological conditions and roof collapse accidents, state-owned coal mines produced 1.31 million tons of coal less than planned, and the utilization rate of each coal cutting machine only reached 38.7 percent. Of the nineteen large electric shovels at the Haizhou open-pit coal mine, eighteen had been damaged to varying degrees in less than two years. In the power industry, in 1954, due to damaged equipment and major power outages, the loss of electricity reached more than 18 million kilowatt-hours.

On the other hand, various factories and mines are organizing production based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and new technical problems are increasing day by day, especially with the increasing number of newly put into production factories and mines. These factories and mines are mostly modern enterprises built with the help of the Soviet Union, and require a higher technical level to master. Due to our weak technical work and low technical level, the equipment in these new factories and mines has been damaged to varying degrees; some automated equipment often cannot be operated, and what should be automated cannot be automated, and production cannot reach the design requirements on schedule; some mines cannot produce normally after being put into production, and mechanical and electrical accidents occur constantly; some have not been able to complete the state plan, so the economic benefits of the state's investment cannot be fully realized.

The situation of technical work in capital construction is also not good enough. This is because the scale of capital construction is expanding, the newly built projects are extremely technically complex, and the technical strength and technical work still cannot keep up with the needs. Taking geological exploration work as an example, there are only dozens of coal mine geological engineers and petroleum geological engineers nationwide. This is an important reason for the many accidents, low quality, large waste, and small effect in geological exploration work. In the design work, on the one hand, the designers lack a clear economic point of view, and on the other hand, they are also limited by the technical level. The construction cost of some mine and power plant buildings even exceeds the planned quota and foreign standards by more than one-third. The situation of idle machinery and low efficiency in construction is also very serious.

The reasons for this serious situation, in addition to the fact that China's fuel industry has a very backward foundation and the original technical strength is very weak, more importantly, quite a few leaders do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of technical work in the country's socialist industrialization. In practice, the implementation of the Soviet experts' suggestions is not strong, the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming the original technical personnel has not been conscientiously implemented, there are also unreasonable phenomena in the use of technical personnel, and not enough attention has been paid to the training of transferred personnel.

Therefore, to strengthen technical work, it is necessary to prescribe the right medicine according to the above-mentioned shortcomings in the work. First, we must improve the work of implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. Over the past few years, we have not studied and implemented many important suggestions made by Soviet experts sufficiently. There is still conservatism in learning from the Soviet Union's scientific and technological experience; bureaucracy is still very serious in implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. In the first half of last year, Soviet experts put forward eleven major suggestions related to China's power industry capital construction. After the Ministry, departments, and bureaus signed and approved them layer by layer, when the experts' work was inspected at the end of the year, they were still being "circulated" and had not been implemented. The Coal Mine Geological Exploration Bureau had a serious situation of low efficiency, poor quality, high cost, and many accidents in drilling work for a long time, which affected the comprehensive completion of the state's planned tasks. In order to solve these key problems, Soviet experts put forward nine written suggestions, but the Coal Mine Geological Exploration Bureau kept these suggestions for more than three months without studying them well. This kind of conservative thinking and bureaucratic style must be overcome. As long as we conscientiously learn from the advanced scientific and technological experience of the Soviet Union and earnestly implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, the face of technical work will definitely be changed.

Implementing the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming the original technical personnel is an important prerequisite for improving technical work. At present, there are still many factories and mines that underestimate the desire for progress and the actual progress of a large number of original technical personnel, and dare not use them boldly. Many technical personnel are restricted in their work and dare not take responsibility, and even if they make suggestions, they repeatedly state that they are "for reference only." This is an abnormal phenomenon and must be changed. Some of the original technical personnel are indeed relatively backward, but most of them want to make progress. We must not only use the latter well, but also help those who are relatively backward, and we must not ignore them.

In the use of technical personnel, many technical personnel are distributed in management organs at all levels, while the technical strength of grassroots organizations is relatively weak. In particular, many newly graduated young technical personnel are also placed in management organs, buried in handling official documents all day long, and rarely have the opportunity to go deep into the site to deal with technical problems; some technical personnel are doing work that is completely unrelated to their professional skills. This unreasonable use must be changed. Only by strengthening the technical strength at the grassroots level can we better strengthen technical work.

Old cadres are the leading backbone of enterprises, and they urgently need to improve their business and technical management capabilities. We should always care about them, organize them to study actively, and enable them to master the scientific and technological knowledge necessary to manage enterprises as soon as possible. We must help these comrades overcome the erroneous ideas of not studying their business, not enthusiastically familiarizing themselves with production knowledge, being satisfied with the old ways, being satisfied with general leadership, thinking that "we can conquer the world with the enthusiasm of employees alone," and often trying to replace frequent and meticulous production command with "vigorous" movements, etc., which ignore technical work. In the past, this very important work has not attracted due attention, and there is still a lack of planned organization for the training of incumbent cadres.

Now, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has attached importance to strengthening technical work. In the inspection of studying the Soviet Union and implementing the suggestions of experts, it focused on criticizing the thinking of ignoring technical work. In the personnel meeting, it was emphasized that the policy towards the original technical personnel should be correctly implemented, the political and ideological education of the original technical personnel should be strengthened, their technical level should be continuously improved, they should be used correctly, and unreasonable phenomena in the use should be overcome. In addition, a symposium was held for transferred personnel to exchange their experiences in studying business and learning technology. Last year and this year, training courses for bureau, factory, and mine directors were also held in rotation. The time was short and the topics were focused, and the trainees felt that they had gained a lot. Such training courses will continue to be held.

We believe that the efforts made in improving technical work are not enough. We are now preparing to formulate some effective measures, continuously strengthen the organizational leadership of technical work, conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, vigorously organize the training of incumbent cadres, plan to train and cultivate technical talents, rationally use technical personnel, and educate transferred personnel to conscientiously learn technology and improve the level of business leadership, so as to further improve and improve the level of enterprise management.

### 积极改进燃料工业的技术工作

    积极改进燃料工业的技术工作
    燃料工业部办公厅副主任　王金林
    从一九五零年到一九五四年，国家给燃料工业部门分配了大、专学生六千多人，燃料工业部中等技术学校毕业的学生，有五千多人参加了工作。机械化采矿的比重也日益增加，煤、电、石油等方面都制定了许多规程和制度，使很多工作有成规可循。因此，应该说燃料工业的技术力量是有所增长的。
    但是，燃料工业发展得更快。煤和电的产量都增加了两倍，石油的生产增加了将近七倍，基本建设的规模逐年扩大，限额以上的建设单位中，今年要完成建设或完成部分重要工程建设的项目就有五十余个。和这种需要比较起来，技术力量仍很不足，技术领导也显得薄弱。
    一九五二年底提出“把基本建设放在首要地位”后，为了满足基本建设发展的需要，曾经从原有厂矿中抽调了大批技术人员去充实地质、设计和施工部门，原有生产厂矿的技术人员大大减少了。有的厂矿连一个工程师也没有，由一些新从大学毕业的技术人员支持生产；许多重要的生产岗位不得不由徒工负责。他们的经验不足，遇到异常情况常常手忙脚乱，使事故扩大，设备利用率和产品质量的提高都受到影响。一九五四年内，国营煤矿由于地质情况变化和冒顶事故等原因的影响，少产了一百三十一万吨煤，每台割煤机的使用率仅达到百分之三十八点七。海州露天煤矿十九台大电铲使用不到两年已有十八台遭到不同程度的损坏。电业方面，一九五四年由于损坏设备和重大的停电事故，损失电量达一千八百多万度。
    另一方面，各个厂矿都在根据苏联的先进经验组织生产，新的技术问题一天比一天多，特别是新投入生产的厂矿日益增多，这些厂矿大都是苏联帮助我国建设的现代化的企业，需要有更高的技术水平去掌握。由于我们的技术工作薄弱，技术水平低，这些新厂矿的设备，有的遭到不同程度的损坏；一些自动化的设备往往因不会操作，该自动的不能自动，产量不能按期达到设计要求；有的矿井投入生产后不能正常生产，机电事故不断发生；有的一直不能完成国家计划，使国家投资的经济效果不能充分发挥。
    基本建设方面技术工作的状况也是不够好的。这是因为基本建设的规模日益扩大，新建的工程项目技术极其复杂，技术力量和技术工作还是赶不上需要。以地质勘探工作为例，全国只有煤矿地质工程师、石油地质工程师数十名。这是地质勘探工作中事故多、质量低、浪费大、效果小的重要原因。在设计工作中，一方面设计人员缺乏明确的经济观点，另一方面也受技术水平的限制，有的矿井和电厂厂房的建筑设计造价，竟超过计划定额和国外标准三分之一以上。施工中机械闲置不用，效率低的情况也是十分严重的。
    产生这种严重情况的原因，除了我国燃料工业的旧有基础十分落后，原有的技术力量很薄弱外，更重要的是有相当不少的领导人员，对于技术工作在国家社会主义工业化事业中的重要性认识不足。表现在工作中对苏联专家的建议贯彻执行不力，对原有技术人员的团结教育改造的政策没有认真地贯彻，对技术人员的使用方面也存在不合理的现象，对转业人员的培养也注意得不够。
    因此加强技术工作，必须根据上述工作中的缺点来对症下药。首先要改善贯彻苏联专家建议的工作。我们几年来对苏联专家提出的许多重要建议，学习和贯彻都是不够的。在学习苏联科学技术经验中还存在保守思想；在贯彻苏联专家建议中，官僚主义还十分严重。去年上半年，苏联专家提出了十一件有关我国电业基本建设方面的重大建议，经过部、司、局层层签署批示，到年底进行专家工作检查时，还在“传阅”而没有得到贯彻。煤矿地质勘探局在钻探工作上较长时间存在效率低、质量差、成本高、事故多的严重情况，影响国家计划任务的全面完成。苏联专家为了解决这些关键性的问题，提出了九项书面建议，但煤矿地质勘探局却把这些建议积压了三个多月，没有很好地研究。这种保守思想和官僚主义作风必须克服。只要认真学习苏联先进的科学技术经验，切实贯彻苏联专家的建议，技术工作的面貌是一定会改变的。
    贯彻党对原有技术人员团结、教育、改造的政策，是改善技术工作的一个重要前提。现在还有不少厂矿对大批原有技术人员要求进步的心情和确实在进步的情况估计不足，不敢大胆使用。许多技术人员在工作中束手束脚，不敢负责，即使提出意见也是再三表明“只供参考”。这是一种不正常的现象，必须改变。原有技术人员中确实有些人比较落后，但大多数是要求进步的。对后者固然要很好使用他们，就是对比较落后的，也要帮助他们，决不能置之不理。
    在技术人员的使用上，很多技术人员分布在各级管理机关中，而基层组织的技术力量比较薄弱。特别是许多刚毕业的青年技术人员也被安插在管理机关，竟日埋头于处理公文，很少有深入现场处理技术问题的机会；还有些技术人员做着完全同他们的专业技术无关的工作。这种使用不合理的情况必须加以改变，只有把基层的技术力量充实起来，才能更好地加强技术工作。
    老干部是企业的领导骨干，他们迫切需要提高业务、技术的管理能力。应该经常关怀他们，组织他们积极学习，使他们尽快地掌握管理企业所必需的科学技术知识。要帮助这些同志克服那种不钻研业务、不热心地去熟知生产知识而满足于老一套、满足于一般化的领导、认为“单凭职工热情就可以打天下”，常常企图以“蓬勃”的运动代替经常细致的生产指挥等等忽视技术工作的错误思想。过去，这个十分重要的工作还没有引起应有的注意，对在职干部的培养还缺乏有计划的组织。
    现在，燃料工业部对加强技术工作已经引起重视。在检查学习苏联和贯彻专家建议的工作中，曾着重批判了忽视技术工作的思想。在人事会议中，强调了要正确的执行对原有技术人员的政策，加强对原有技术人员的政治思想教育，不断地提高他们的技术水平，正确地使用他们，克服在使用上的不合理现象。另外，并召集转业人员开了座谈会，交流了他们钻研业务，学习技术的经验。去年和今年并举办了局、厂、矿长的轮训班，时间短，课题集中，受训人员感到收获很大。这样的轮训班将继续办下去。
    我们认为在改善技术工作中所作的努力还是不够的，现在正准备制定一些有效的措施，不断加强对技术工作的组织领导，认真学习苏联先进经验和贯彻苏联专家的建议，大力组织在职干部的培养，有计划地训练培养技术人才，合理使用技术人员，并教育转业人员认真学习技术，提高业务领导水平，以进一步改进和提高企业管理水平。
