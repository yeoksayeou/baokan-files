Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 3rd: According to a report in the Indonesian "People's Daily" on June 3rd, the chairman of the Indonesian investigation committee responsible for investigating the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash, Imawang, told the newspaper that the committee's "all investigation results are one hundred percent reliable." Imawang said: "I am an expert, not a politician. I can deal with any attack on the investigation results of the committee I chair."

Imawang emphasized that the investigation of the aircraft wreckage was conducted "extremely carefully." Parts of the aircraft structure were taken to the laboratory for testing. Twisted or broken metal objects were examined using scientific methods to determine whether they were caused by an explosion. Even the mud and sand adhering to various parts of the aircraft were studied.

Imawang then said that after affirmative results were obtained based on all these circumstances, the committee went to Hong Kong to investigate the possibility that someone had placed a bomb there. He said that this possibility clearly existed.

Imawang said that the committee began work on April 14th, spent a month and a half, and finished work on May 27th. The investigation work first took place in the Natuna Islands. And intelligence was collected from Singapore and India, and then investigations were conducted in Hong Kong. He said that before the wreckage of the plane was salvaged from the sea, the investigation committee had already determined through analysis that this event was not an ordinary incident, but the result of some planned action. This judgment was made based on the testimony of survivors and a lot of other information. Later, after the wreckage of the plane was salvaged, this analysis was proven correct. Imawang said that the evidence obtained from the plane was consistent with the analysis.

    印度尼西亚调查委员会主席谈飞机失事事件调查结果
    断定“克什米尔公主号”遭到有计划的破坏
    新华社雅加达三日电　据印度尼西亚“人民日报”三日报道，负责调查“克什米尔公主号”飞机失事事件的印度尼西亚调查委员会主席伊马汪对该报记者发表谈话说，委员会“所有调查的结果都是百分之百地可靠的。”伊马汪说：“我是一个专家，不是一个政治家。我能够对付对我所主持的委员会的调查结果的任何攻击。”
    伊马汪着重指出：对飞机残骸的调查进行得“极为仔细”。飞机的部分结构曾拿到实验室里去检验过。扭曲的或破碎的金属物都用科学方法加以检验，以查明它们是否是爆炸造成的。甚至沾在飞机各部分上的泥沙也经过了研究。
    伊马汪接着说，当根据所有这些情况得出了肯定的结果以后，委员会就到香港去调查有人在那里安放炸弹的可能性。他说，这种可能性显然是确实存在的。
    伊马汪说，委员会在四月十四日开始工作，花了一个半月的时间，在五月二十七日结束工作。调查工作最先是在纳土纳群岛进行的。并且从新加坡和印度收集了情报，然后在香港进行调查。他说，在飞机残骸还未从海中打捞起来以前，调查委员会已经经过分析，断定这个事件不是一个普通事件，而是某种有计划的行动的结果。这是根据幸存者和其他方面的很多情报而作出的判断。后来在飞机残骸捞出以后，证明这种分析是正确的。伊马汪说，从飞机上获得的证据是同分析吻合的。
