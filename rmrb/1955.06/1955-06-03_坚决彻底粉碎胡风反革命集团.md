    Resolutely and Thoroughly Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
    Raise Revolutionary Vigilance, Eliminate Reactionary Groups
    Li Jinxi
    After reading the two batches of materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party group revealed in the "People's Daily" and the partial speeches at the joint enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on May 25, I clearly saw that Hu Feng has consistently opposed and hated the leadership of the Party for more than 20 years. He has been constantly scheming to exploit loopholes to attack and sabotage the Party's leadership, constantly secretly "contacting people" and "winning people over," "strengthening strength" and "opening up work" for his group, and has a set of cunning and hidden methods and "organizational principles" to "ensure the struggle."
    Since the nationwide liberation, everyone has recognized that Chairman Mao's direction in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the direction that literary and art workers should strive for. I never thought that Hu Feng, who was known as a progressive writer before liberation and often used Marxist rhetoric, would be the head of a reactionary group in the literary and art ranks that opposes this literary and art policy and opposes the revolution! It can be seen that we must be very vigilant in any job.
    In his "My Self-Criticism," Hu Feng said that he had "strong sectarian emotions" and was limited by narrow experience, so he made wrong judgments about the current literary and artistic situation. But looking at his secret letters, his ambition for "self-expansion," his resistance and hatred for the Party's leadership, and his means of attacking and slandering the Party, are these merely issues of sectarian emotions or narrow experience? Are these merely issues of making wrong judgments about the current literary and artistic situation? No, this is just a retreat disguised as an attack.
    I agree with the resolution of the joint enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association. It is completely correct to remove Hu Feng, who has been plotting to organize a reactionary group for a long time, from the literary and art ranks.
    Industrial and Commercial Circles Should Be Vigilant
    Wang Guangying
    I felt extremely indignant after reading some materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party group published by the "People's Daily" in succession recently. In the past, many people were deceived by Hu Feng's mask and thought it was just a matter of ideology. Now we can clearly see that the Hu Feng group is an anti-revolutionary conspiracy group with organizational principles, specific policies, and careful plans. In his letter, Hu Feng not only slandered the Party and the responsible comrades of the Party, as well as the Party's literary and artistic policies, but also directed some members of his anti-Party group to use his consistent two-faced tactics to deceive the Party and the people, infiltrate the Party and revolutionary organizations, establish strongholds, and launch a frenzied attack on the Party and the revolutionary cause. Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary conspiracy methods are insidious and vicious.
    People in industrial and commercial circles do not pay enough attention to the situation in literary and art circles, but when we see the revealed materials, it attracts our attention. It turns out that in Tianjin, around us, there are strongholds of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. What they are doing is no longer literary and artistic activities, but counter-revolutionary political activities. Counter-revolutionary political activities have been rampant around us for so long, and we are still not aware of it, and we still think it has nothing to do with us. This is really too negligent.
    Now is the time for us to act in unison with the people of the whole country. Patriotic people in industrial and commercial circles should take this as a lesson, be vigilant against the counter-revolutionary conspirators around us, be vigilant against those hidden saboteurs who, like the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements, are looking forward to the restoration of the counter-revolutionary regime, expose these saboteurs, and eliminate them.
    I support the resolution of the joint enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to remove Hu Feng from all positions and eliminate this counter-revolutionary conspirator and culprit!

    A Jackal in Human Skin
    Cai Chusheng
    The anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary secret letters of Hu Feng, which have been disclosed by the "People's Daily" one after another, have aroused my infinite anger. If it were not for the clear evidence, I would not have believed that Hu Feng, who has been mixing in the progressive literary circles and posing as a progressive cultural worker for more than 20 years, would be so reactionary, insidious, vicious, and despicable in his unspeakable activities behind the scenes, and even in his ways of dealing with people!
    In a certain year after liberation, I had the opportunity to sit in on the trials of various kinds of spies in the courts of Beijing and Shanghai. The conspiracies and tricks of those spies left me with an indelible impression of the cruel and despicable enemies. This time, when reading Hu Feng's secret letters, I couldn't help but think of those situations. But some of the viciousness and despicability of some spies are still beyond Hu Feng's reach!
    Isn't it true that Hu Feng is such a jackal in human skin! He distorted and cut apart the famous sayings of many classic works to cover up his hideous face and vicious intentions. He is a cunning and vicious counter-revolutionary leader who has been lurking in our revolutionary camp for a long time. He and the members of his group with organization, program, strategy, and tactics have been playing two-faced tricks to attack the Party and the literary and art front led by the Party. Their anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary political conspiracies have reached the point of madness!
    As a film worker, I now understand Hu Feng's deep hatred for the people's film industry. He has a complete set of reactionary plans with different appearances and realities. In Hu Feng's so-called "suggestions for reference," he made crazy attacks on the people's film industry led by the Party, which has achieved remarkable achievements. He said that it "has been seriously devastated by sectarianism and seriously poisoned by subjective formalism," that it "has made the rule of sectarianism increasingly rampant," that it "has ensured that erroneous and vulgar works occupy the screen... sacrificing this weapon that can carry out ideological education and quality education to the broad masses," etc. These are all bloody slanders and vicious accusations. While arrogantly proposing to abolish this and that, he also proposed to abolish the film script creation institute and let "writers with leading influence" lead this work. In other words, to let the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng organize and lead film creation and supervise production work.
    His "suggestions" cryptically and insidiously pointed out: abolish the existing various literary and art publications and establish seven or eight so-called "mass publications." The publications are comprehensive and include film scripts. Each publication will put forward two film scripts each year. The chief editors leading these publications are "writers with leading influence." After the works are put forward, the chief editors are responsible on behalf of the writers, and the chief editors will assist the writers in solving the difficulties encountered in the filming process, etc. And Hu Feng is a "writer with leading influence." Isn't it obvious that he wants the Party and the government to abandon its leadership over the people's film creation work and let the head of the counter-revolutionary group Hu Feng "lead" it?
    I think such an interpretation is realistic and not excessive at all. Because if his trick succeeds, he can "grab the banner in his hands" and make his "real subjectivity run and a great will run through China." Then who else would dare to stand up and confront him? Wouldn't it reach his goal of "taking the world as his responsibility" and "everything is available to me"?
    In this way, what kind of "ideological education" will this film, which he said is "a weapon for carrying out ideological education and quality education to the broad masses," promote? We only need to see that he has used all the most vicious words in the dictionary to curse the cultural undertakings led by the Party and the progressive cultural workers inside and outside the Party, and we can know. Hu Feng insulted the righteous and awe-inspiring democratic martyr Wen Yiduo's resistance to the reactionary rule of the Chiang bandit as "opportunism" and insulted our great leader Chairman Mao's classic work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as "totem." All this can prove that the "ideological education" that this jackal in human skin wants to promote is 100% anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary!
    Hu Feng said: "I am sharpening my sword, peeping at the direction. When I see clearly, I am willing to cut off my head and throw it out." How fierce and stubborn this deadly enemy of the Party and the people is! The more than 200,000 words he put forward for a frenzied attack on the Party and the people should be the "head" he threw out when he "saw clearly." But this "old and cunning" Hu Feng is ultimately too "optimistic." He did not estimate that under the illumination of our wise Party, he would immediately expose his counter-revolutionary nature!
    We must never coexist peacefully with jackals. Therefore, I fully support the resolute measures taken by the literary and art circles against Hu Feng and his ilk!
    Here, it is also necessary to warn the Hu Feng elements hidden in the film work department and other departments: Hu Feng's "cluster grenade," he himself clearly pointed out that it was used by the members of the group to "explode." Now that Hu Feng's conspiracy, which has been hidden for more than 20 years, has been exposed, and there will inevitably be more conclusive evidence to prove the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng group, it is impossible for those who have done such anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary bad things to hide and evade, but only to increase their crimes. If you do not want to cut yourself off from the Party and the people, do not want to cut yourself off from the new society and the revolutionary literary and art front, you should respond to the call of the "People's Daily" in time, draw a clear line between yourself and the beastly Hu Feng, thoroughly explain the problem, wash your mind and reform yourself, and from then on be a real person again!
    Let all of our film workers and all of our literary and art workers unite more closely around the Party, raise vigilance, and make resolute struggles to defend the people's revolutionary regime, to defend the revolutionary literary and art front, and to thoroughly smash the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary group!
    Thoroughly Investigate the Crimes of the Hu Feng Group
    Zhang Xiaomei
    The criminal activities of the Hu Feng reactionary group have finally been exposed. This is a great victory for our Party and our revolutionary cause. The broad masses of people and the broad masses of women are all extremely indignant at Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary conspiracies and crimes.
    Judging from the materials revealed in the newspapers, Hu Feng has consistently opposed the Chinese Communist Party, opposed the revolutionary literary and art ranks, and hated the victory of the people for more than 20 years. Hu Feng used all the most vicious words and did his best to slander the great Chinese Communist Party, which has led the Chinese people in revolutionary struggles for more than 30 years and is loved by all the people. Hu Feng also shamelessly cursed those literary and art fighters who have passed away and are forever remembered by the people and the martyrs who sacrificed themselves. The liberation and victory that the Chinese people have dreamed of for many years has become a "great depression" and "brought shackles" in Hu Feng's view. In short, the things that the people love and welcome are "disasters" and "dirty and smelly" in Hu Feng's view, and he wants to "shake" them from the root. Isn't this precisely the evil deeds of extremely stubborn counter-revolutionary elements!
    Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary activities were carried out in an organized, planned, strategic, and programmatic way. Hu Feng put forward a series of reactionary literary and art theories to oppose the Party's literary and art policies, and even clamored to openly demand the abolition of the Party's leadership over literary and art work. He systematically assigned the core members of this reactionary group to various places to "open up work," "contact people," and "win people over," and even placed spies within the Chinese Communist Party to steal Party documents and inquire about news. The members of this anti-Party group used shameless methods such as fabricating anonymous letters and fabricating fake symposium records to carry out so-called "nerve warfare" against the literary and art publications led by the Party, trying to "entangle it," "exhaust it," and "break through it" to seize "positions." Whenever the Party launched a serious struggle against bourgeois literary and art ideology, Hu Feng would direct and instigate his followers to "prepare," open "gaps," and try to transform the serious struggle into an attack on the Party's leadership. Can such organized conspiracy activities, which are deliberately attempting to usurp the Party's leadership and undermine the revolutionary literary and art cause, not be deeply hated!
    The Hu Feng reactionary group has consistently used extremely cunning two-faced tactics to cover up their counter-revolutionary crimes. For many years, Hu Feng has consistently appeared as a revolutionary literary and art writer. Regarding the Party's literary and art policies, "don't touch it in words," and "follow it where possible," but "do 'heart-digging warfare' from a theoretical point of view," trying to shake the theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism. Regarding the Party and the revolutionary literary and art ranks, on the surface, we should "perfunctorily" and even "shake hands and make peace," but in essence, we want to "coexist with the position" and fight against the people to the end. When the Hu Feng reactionary group's conspiracy activities were exposed, Hu Feng immediately instructed his party members to retreat quickly, telling them to "seek rebirth in endurance" and place their hopes on the "distant future" in order to preserve their strength and vainly attempt to make a comeback. Isn't this two-faced attitude towards the revolution precisely the method that those hidden and most vicious enemies have consistently adopted? Isn't it a rehash of the counter-revolutionary tactics of the Trotskyites!
    We firmly demand that the People's Government thoroughly investigate all the crimes of the Hu Feng reactionary group and deal with them severely!
    Investigate the Background of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group
    Ruan Zhangjing
    The anti-revolutionary materials of the Hu Feng group revealed in newspapers and periodicals since May 13 have made my hair stand on end. The problem of the Hu Feng anti-Party group is no longer a matter of ideology and theory, nor is it a matter of general political errors, nor is it merely a matter of ideological struggle in the literary and art circles and ideological circles, but a counter-revolutionary problem carried out by a conspiracy group. This is an important issue concerning the future of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause.
    The anti-Party group leader, Hu Feng, his murderous ink marks written by himself cannot be washed away. Hu Feng's ferocious face and vicious heart cannot be covered up by words such as "the revolutionary nature and position of the petty bourgeoisie." In recent days, countless people have said this: Reading this bad guy's "articles" in the past, everyone would inexplicably find them difficult to understand. But after reading the two batches of "materials" published in the "People's Daily," I was awakened. It turns out that the reason why people cannot find what people say in Hu Feng's "articles" is because Hu Feng hides an unspeakable criminal attempt.
    Now, we all understand. But I can't help but ask: Which brand does the Hu Feng group belong to?
    Why did Hu Feng put forward a set of propositions and "theories" that are specifically against the Party and the people in every period before and after the Anti-Japanese War, buzzing and biting the Marxist Party and progressive writers like "flies and mosquitoes" without fatigue? Why did Hu Feng prevent countless young writers from integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, telling them not to go to the liberated areas and not to participate in the fiery struggle?
    The literary direction of the Chinese people was solved by the historical and brilliant instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong - "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." However, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group dared to slander the "Talks" as a "totem." Where did the Hu Feng group get these foul voices to spread from? We must thoroughly investigate! Find out the general station behind the Hu Feng group!
    I worked and lived in North China for a long time. From January 1950, in Tianjin, Hu Feng, through its long-sent hidden members - Lu Dian and Lu Li, used a cunning way (describing A Long as a "revolutionary theorist") to smuggle a pillar of the Hu Feng group - A Long (Chen Yimen, Chen Shoumei) to Tianjin, and stole a considerable position in the literary and art leadership organization. From this time on, the Party's literary and art policy could not be implemented in some "writers" in Tianjin. And anti-Marxist "theory of inclination" and other so-called "theories" that promote corrupt and reactionary bourgeois ideas came out. The well-intentioned and solemn criticism of the central Party newspaper, the intervention of the Tianjin Party organization, etc., did not cause Hu Feng members to abandon evil and return to righteousness, but caused dirty curses and various kinds of slander. The "literary salons" and "Chinese Stanislavsky" that Hu Feng members often held in Tianjin, and the disgusting titles of "salon夫人" all came out. Here, the dark, gray, neurasthenic, and incoherent "poems" of the so-called "poets" of the Hu Feng group exuded a rancid smell. This is the "base" that Hu Feng called "ignited in Tianjin."
    In the autumn of 1951, Lu Dian, a core member of the Hu Feng group, actually "represented" the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles to participate in the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and stole the position of executive committee member. Reading the second batch of "materials" made me even more frightened. Lu Dian, this slave of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group who has always pretended to be very "honest" in front of the Party and has always been characterized by not saying a word at any meeting, turned out to be a spy who tipped off the news and a thief who stole secret documents. Over the years, Lu Dian has constantly recommended the followers of this counter-revolutionary group to the leaders of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to ambush in the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles (such as Feng Dahai and Li Li), and has repeatedly used various tricks to transfer A Long from Tianjin, but fortunately, the Party stopped them in time and the majority of comrades strongly opposed it, and their conspiracy was not successful. Now I know that this conspiracy plan was planned in this group. We were not completely without suspicion, but due to serious paralysis in politics, we always thought it was a matter of thought. However, Lu Dian, this slave who was wholeheartedly devoted to Hu Feng, we kindly criticized his literary and artistic ideas, but he disguised himself so cleverly, performed so "realistically," and repeatedly declared to the Party that he was not a Hu Feng member at all, only had a few meetings, general "friendship" exchanges, and even refused to admit whether there was a "tacit agreement" in thought, and guaranteed that he would work according to the Party's principles and principles in the future, and so on. At this time, Lu Dian was actively participating in Hu Feng's drafting of hundreds of thousands of words of "report" to the Central Committee at all costs. Unexpectedly, this guy who had just made a guarantee to the Party was the creator of the "five knives" theory.
    We must find out the truth about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group's activities so that its bottom can be exposed!
    If anyone thinks that the Hu Feng group only wants to compete for the leadership of the literary and art positions, that is too naive. If anyone thinks that Hu Feng's "self-criticism" writes: "If it were not for the revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, I would not have found a place to settle down in the past 20 years," it seems that there is still a bit of "sincerity," then that is a big mistake! Please see: Last year, when this group was drafting the so-called "report," a member of the Hu Feng group got married. The next night, a banquet was held in a restaurant in Di'anmen. Hu Feng members from Beijing and Tianjin crowded around a round table. The host, the leader of the anti-Party group, Hu Feng, raised his glass and shouted: "Today, this is our 'liberated area'."
    Hu Feng had long told his party members: "Many people are like wearing shackles, ... like little daughters-in-law, often afraid of being beaten," and the literary and art field "cannot be regarded as a position." Now, we understand. The Hu Feng group wants to seize their "liberated area," not any literary and art field. What kind of "liberated area" is their so-called "liberated area"? This is what we want to ask to the end.
    From the "second batch of materials," we can see that Hu Feng regards criticizing the mistakes of the "Literary Gazette" as his once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ("seized a gap"). They had sharpened their swords and peeped at the direction long ago, calling on the "generals" and minions of this group lurking in various places to stir up trouble: submit letters of opinion, write anonymous letters, change the place of posting, fabricate readers' opinions, write articles under pseudonyms, etc., "using the tactics of cluster grenades," throwing them out from the open, from the dark, from all corners. This is what the group called "flags all over the mountains." Before the enlarged joint meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association in October last year, the Hu Feng group had made combat preparations in advance, checked weapons (studied the outline of speeches), and called for unified action and a full-scale attack. Xu Fang, one of Hu Feng's party members, responded and shouted: "Total annihilation, regardless of the cost!"
    However, Hu Feng and his party members forgot an old Chinese saying: "Those who play with fire will burn themselves." The Marxist theoretical front immediately launched a fierce counterattack against this conspiracy group. After a few rounds, Hu Feng's tail was exposed. Seeing that the omen was bad, Hu Feng immediately "withdrew his troops" and wrote a fake self-criticism ("My Self-Criticism"). On the other hand, he instructed his party members to actively participate in the criticism meeting and write "critical articles" to cover up the retreat. From Hu Feng's reply to one of his party members hidden in a certain editorial department, we can understand what conspiracy is hidden in the "self-criticism." Hu Feng said to this party member: They (a certain editorial department) asked you to write an article criticizing me, "If you don't write it, the artillery fire will be drawn to you. But, you have to write it so that they can't use it!" How much hatred this counter-revolutionary group has for the Party and the people! They are "preserving their strength" in order to seize the opportunity to rise again!
    Now, we understand a lot of things. But, we still want to ask: What exactly is Hu Feng and his group doing? We must pursue and investigate layer by layer and find out the bottom of this counter-revolutionary group!

    坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    提高革命警惕，肃清反动集团
    黎锦熙
    看到“人民日报”揭发的关于胡风反党集团的两批材料和五月二十五日中国文联主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的部分发言以后，我很明显地看清了胡风是二十多年来一贯地敌视和仇恨党的领导的，是对党的领导时时在阴谋钻空子进行攻击和破坏的，是时时在秘密地“联络人”“争取人”，在对他的集团“加强实力”“开辟工作”的，是有一套狡猾的隐蔽的手法和“组织原则”来“保证斗争”的。
    自从全国解放以来，大家都已认定了毛主席的
  “在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”所指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方针，是文艺工作者一致努力的方向；我一直没想到像胡风这样在解放前号称进步作家、常常运用马克思主义的言辞的人，竟是文艺队伍中反对这个文艺方针、反对革命的反动集团的头子！可见我们在任何岗位工作中，必须十分提高警惕。
    胡风在“我的自我批判”中说他有“强烈的宗派情绪”，并且为狭隘的经验所限制，因此对现实的文艺情况作了错误的判断。但一看他的密信，他那种“自我扩张”的野心，对于党的领导的反抗和仇恨，他那种攻击党、污蔑党的手段，难道仅仅是宗派情绪或狭隘经验的问题吗？难道仅仅是对现在的文艺情况作了错误的判断的问题吗？不，这只是从进攻转为退却的一种遁词而已。
    我赞成中国文联主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，把长期一贯阴谋组织反动集团的胡风从文艺队伍里清除出去是完全正确的。
    工商界人士应该警惕
    王光英
    我看到了“人民日报”最近连续两次发表的关于胡风反党集团的一些材料，感到无比的愤慨。过去很多人为胡风的假面具所蒙蔽，以为仅仅是思想上的问题，现在我们可以清楚地看出，胡风集团是有组织原则、有具体方针、有周密计划的反革命阴谋集团。胡风在他的信中，不仅诬蔑党和党的负责同志以及党的文艺方针，而且还指挥他的反党集团的一些分子，运用他一贯的两面派手法，欺骗党和人民，打入党内及革命团体内，建立据点，向党和革命事业进行猖狂的进攻。胡风反革命的阴谋活动的手段，是阴险、毒辣的。
    工商界人士对文学艺术界的情况，是关怀不足的，可是当我们看到所揭露的材料以后，就引起了我们的注意。原来在天津，在我们的身边，就有胡风反革命的据点，他们所进行的，已不是文艺活动，而是反革命的政治活动。反革命的政治活动在我们身边猖獗了这样久，我们还不自觉，还认为与我们无关，这实在是太麻痹了。
    现在正是时候，是我们与全国人民一致行动起来的时候。爱国的工商界人士应该以这件事引为教训，警惕我们周围的反革命阴谋家，警惕那些同胡风反革命分子一样期待着反革命政权复辟的隐藏着的破坏分子，把这些破坏分子揭发出来，清洗出去。
    我拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，撤销胡风的一切职务，把这个反革命阴谋家和罪魁清洗出去！（原载“大公报”）
    披着人皮的豺狼
    蔡楚生
    “人民日报”先后披露出来的胡风那些反党、反人民、反革命的密信，激起了我的无限愤怒。如果不是证据昭彰，我真不会相信二十多年来混迹进步文坛、貌为进步文化工作者的胡风，在他背着天日的那些不可告人的活动中，以至在他为人处世的心术上，竟会是如此反动、阴险、狠毒、可耻！
    解放后的某一年，我曾有机会在北京上海的法庭上旁听对各种各样的特务的审讯。那些特务的阴谋诡计，使我在对残酷而可耻的敌人的认识上，留下了永难磨灭的印象。这次在读胡风那些密信时，我不由得联想起那些情形。但是有些特务的恶毒可耻，比起胡风的行为来还是望尘莫及！
    可不是吗，胡风就是这样一条披着人皮的豺狼！他歪曲、割裂了许多经典著作的名言，用来遮蔽他那狰狞的面目和狠毒的用心，他是长期潜伏在我们革命阵营中的狡猾而恶毒的反革命头子，他和他那有组织、有纲领、有战略战术的集团中的分子，一直在耍着两面派的手法，进攻党和党所领导的文艺战线，他们这种反党、反人民、反革命的政治阴谋已达到了疯狂的程度！
    作为一个电影工作者，我现在才明白胡风对人民电影事业所抱的深仇大恨，他是有表里互异的整套反动计划的。在胡风那个所谓“作为参考的建议”中，他对党所领导的、获得了显著成就的人民电影事业作着疯狂的攻击，什么“严重地受到了宗派主义底摧残，严重地被主观公式主义所毒害”，什么“使宗派主义的统治日益猖狂”，什么“保证了错误的和庸俗的作品占住了银幕……牺牲了这个能够向广泛的群众进行思想教育品质教育的武器”，等等，都是含血喷人、恶毒无比的诬蔑。他在狂妄地提议要取消这个那个的同时，也提议要取消电影剧本创作所，而由“有领导影响的作家”来领导这一工作。——换一句话说就是让反革命的胡风来组织、领导电影创作以及监督制作工作。
    他的“建议”诡秘而阴毒地指出：取消现有各种文艺刊物，建立七、八个所谓“群众刊物”，刊物是综合性的、其中有电影剧本，每一刊物每年提出两个电影剧本——领导这些刊物的主编是
  “有领导影响的作家”——作品提出后，主编代表作家负责，在拍制过程中主编协助作家解决所遭遇的困难等等。而胡风是“有领导影响的作家”，这不是很明显地要使党和政府放弃它对人民电影创作工作的领导，而让反革命集团的头子胡风来“领导”吗？
    作这样的诠释，我想是合乎实际的，绝不过份的。因为如果他的诡计得售，他就能“把大旗抓到手里”，使他“真的主观在运行，一个大的意志贯穿了中国”，那末还有谁敢于起来和他抗衡？还不是要达到他那“以天下为己任”、“万物皆备于我”的目的吗？
    这样，这个据他说是“向广泛的群众进行思想教育品质教育的武器”的电影，将宣传什么样的“思想教育”呢？我们只要看他用尽了字典上所有最刻毒的字眼来咒诅党所领导的文化事业和党内外进步的文化工作者，就可以知道了。胡风侮辱大义凛然的民主烈士闻一多对蒋贼反动统治的抗争为“投机”，侮辱我们伟大的领袖毛主席的经典著作“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”为“图腾”——这一切就可证实这披着人皮的豺狼所要宣传的百分之百是反党、反人民、反革命的“思想教育”！
    胡风说：“我在磨我的剑，窥测方向，到我看准了的时候，我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去”　——这个党和人民的死敌，是表现得如何凶狠和顽固啊！他所提的向党和人民作猖狂进攻的二十多万字，应该就是他“看准了”的时候抛掷出来的“头颅”了；但这“老谋深算”的胡风，终究是太过
  “乐观”了，他没有估计到在我们英明的党的烛照下，他一下子就暴露出它的反革命的本相！
    我们决不能跟豺狼和平共处，因此我完全拥护文学艺术界对胡风和阿垅之流所采取的断然的措施！
    在这里，还必须正告隐藏在电影工作部门中和其它部门中的胡风分子：胡风那“集束手榴弹”，他自己就明白指出是用集团中的分子来“爆炸”的。现在隐蔽了二十多年的胡风的阴谋被揭穿了，而且必然还有更多的真凭实据可以来证实胡风集团反革命的罪恶；因此曾做过这种反党、反人民、反革命的坏事的分子，要想隐瞒、躲避都是不可能的，只有增加他的罪谬的。如果不想自绝于党和人民，不想自绝于新社会和革命文艺阵地，就应该及时响应
  “人民日报”的号召，和人面兽心的胡风划清界限，把问题彻底交代清楚，洗心革面，从此重新做个真正的人！
    让我们所有的电影工作者、和所有的文艺工作者都更紧密地团结在党的周围，提高警惕，为保卫人民革命的政权，为保卫革命的文艺阵地，为彻底粉碎胡风反党、反人民、反革命的集团而作坚决的斗争！
    彻底查清胡风集团的罪行

    胡风反动集团的罪恶活动，终于被揭穿了。这是我们党，我们革命事业的一个伟大胜利。广大人民，广大妇女，对胡风反党反人民反革命的阴谋罪行，无不万分愤慨。
    从报纸上揭露的材料来看，胡风二十多年来，一贯敌视中国共产党，敌视革命的文艺队伍，痛恨人民的胜利。对于领导中国人民进行了三十多年革命斗争、为全体人民所热爱的伟大的中国共产党，胡风用尽了一切恶毒的字眼，极尽污蔑之能事。对于那些为人民所永远追念的逝世了的文艺斗士和牺牲了的先烈们，胡风也无耻地加以咒骂。中国人民多少年来梦寐以求的解放和胜利，在胡风看来，竟成为“绝大的苦闷”和“带上了枷”。总之，人民所热爱、所欢迎的事情，在胡风看来，都是“灾难”，都是“脏臭”的，都是他要从根“动摇”的。这难道不正是极端顽固的反革命分子的恶行吗！
    胡风的反革命活动，是有组织有计划有策略有纲领地进行的。胡风提出了一系列的反动的文艺理论来敌对党的文艺方针，甚至嚣张到公开要求取消党对文艺工作的领导。他把这个反动集团的骨干分子有计划地分配到各地去“开辟工作”、“联络人”、“争取人”，甚至在中国共产党党内安置坐探，盗窃党内文件，探听消息。这个反党集团的分子，用捏造匿名信，捏造假座谈会记录等等无耻方式，向党所领导的文艺刊物进行所谓“神经战”，企图“缠住它”、“累倒它”、“冲破它”来夺取
  “阵地”。每当党展开反对资产阶级文艺思想的严肃斗争时，胡风就指挥、策动其喽啰“要准备起来”，打开“缺口”，企图把严肃的斗争转化成为对党的领导的攻击。这种处心积虑企图篡夺党的领导，破坏革命文艺事业的有组织的阴谋活动，能够不令人深恶痛绝吗！
    胡风反动集团一贯以极其狡猾的两面派手腕来掩护他们的反革命罪行。多少年来胡风一贯以革命文艺作家的面貌出现。对于党的文艺方针，在“字面上不要去碰它”，“可能的地方还要顺着它”，但却要“从理论上去做‘挖心战’”，企图动摇马克思列宁主义的理论基础。对于党和革命文艺队伍，在表面上，要“敷衍”，甚至“握手言欢”，但实质上却想用“与阵地共存亡的决心”来和人民作对到底。当胡风反动集团的阴谋活动被揭露后，胡风立即指示他的党徒赶紧退却，要他们“在忍受中求得重生”，把希望寄托在“远大的未来”，以便保存力量，妄图死灰复燃。这种对待革命的两面派的态度不正是那些暗藏的最为狠毒的敌人所一贯采取的手法吗？不正是托洛茨基分子的一套反革命战术的翻版吗！
    我们坚决要求人民政府彻底查清胡风反动集团的全部罪行，并严加处理！
    追查胡风反革命集团的底细
    阮章竞
    从五月十三日以来，报纸刊物所揭露的胡风集团的反革命材料，使我毛骨悚然。胡风反党集团的问题，已经不是什么思想和理论问题，也不是什么一般的政治性的错误问题，也不仅仅是文艺界、思想界的思想斗争问题，而是一个阴谋集团所进行的反革命问题，这是关系到中国人民革命事业前途的重要问题。
    反党集团头子——胡风，他亲手所写下的杀气腾腾的墨迹，是洗也洗不掉了。胡风的狰狞嘴脸和恶毒心肠，是不能拿“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”等等词句所能掩盖住的。这些天来，无数的人们都这样说：读这个坏家伙过去写的“文章”，谁都会莫名其妙地难懂。可是读了“人民日报”刊载的两批“材料”，才惊醒过来，原来在胡风的“文章”里找不到人说的话，是因为胡风包藏了一个不可告人的罪恶企图。
    现在，我们都明白了。但我禁不住还要问：胡风集团，到底是属于哪家牌号？
    胡风，为什么在抗日战争以前和以后，在每一个时期都提出一套专同党和人民作对的主张、“理论”，像“苍蝇蚊子”一样，毫不疲倦地向马克思主义的党和进步作家嗡嗡地叫，乱咬？胡风为什么长期阻止无数的青年作家去同工农兵结合，叫他们不要去解放区，不要去参加火热的斗争？
    中国人民的文学方向，由于得到毛泽东同志的历史性的辉煌指示——“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”而获得解决。而胡风反革命集团，胆敢污蔑“讲话”为“图腾”。胡风集团这些恶臭的声音，是从什么电台拿来传播的呢？我们要彻底追查！把胡风集团背后的总台查出来！
    我曾长期在华北工作和生活。从一九五○年一月起，在天津，胡风通过它早已派遣来的暗藏分子——芦甸、鲁藜，把胡风集团的一根台柱——阿垅
  （陈亦门、陈守梅），用诡诈的方式（把阿垅描写成为“革命理论家”）偷运到了天津，并窃取了文艺领导组织的一个相当位置。从这时候起，党的文艺方针，在天津一部分“作家”中行不通。而反马克思主义的“论倾向性”及其它宣传腐朽反动的资产阶级思想的所谓“理论”出来了。中央党报的善意和严正的批评，天津党的组织的干涉等等，在胡风分子中所引起的，不是改邪归正，而是肮脏的谩骂和各色各样的中伤。胡风分子在天津经常举办的什么“文艺沙龙”，什么“中国的斯坦尼”，什么“沙龙夫人”，这些叫人作呕的封号都出来了。在这里，所谓胡风集团的“诗人”的阴暗的、灰色的、神经失常的、语无伦次的“诗”，散发着腐臭气味。这就是胡风所谓的“在天津，是烧起了的”的“据点”。
    一九五一年秋天，胡风集团的骨干分子——芦甸，竟“代表”了天津文联参加华北文联，并窃取了常务委员的职位。读了第二批“材料”，使我更怵目惊心。芦甸，这个从来在党面前装扮得很“老实”，在任何会议上，从来是以一言不发为其特征的胡风反革命集团的奴才，原来是一个通风报信的坐探，一个窃取秘密文件的贼儿。几年来，芦甸不断地向华北文联领导者，推荐这个反革命集团的喽啰们到华北文联来埋伏（如冯大海、李离），并三番五次地采用各种伎俩，要把阿垅从天津转运来，幸得党的及时制止和大多数同志的竭力反对，没有中了他们的阴谋。现在知道，这个阴谋计划是曾在这个集团里策划好了的。我们也不是完全没有过怀疑，但由于政治上犯了严重的麻痹症，总以为这是思想问题。而芦甸——这个对胡风死心塌地的奴才，我们善意地批评过他的文艺思想，但他伪装得那样巧妙，表演得那样“逼真”，并曾屡次向党表白：他绝不是胡风分子，仅仅有数面之交，一般的“友谊”来往，连思想上是否有“不谋而合”，都拒绝承认，而且保证以后一定要按党的方针原则工作，等等。就在这个时候，芦甸正在不顾一切地积极参加胡风的起草数十万字的向中央的“报告书”。没料想到这个刚刚向党作了保证的家伙，就是“五把刀子”论的制造者。
    胡风反革命集团所进行的勾当，我们必须要追问个水落石出，使它的底子露出来！
    如果有人认为胡风集团只是想争夺文艺阵地的领导，那是太天真了。如果有人认为胡风的“自我批判”中写着：“如果不是革命和中国共产党，我个人二十多年来是找不到安身立命之地的”，似乎还有点滴“诚意”，那就大错特错了！请看吧：去年，正是这个集团在起草所谓“报告书”的时候，胡风集团的一个分子结婚，第二天晚上，在地安门一家饭馆里举行宴会，京、津两地的胡风分子熙熙攘攘，挤围着一张圆桌，东道主、反党集团头子——胡风举杯高呼：“今天在这里才是我们的‘解放区’。”
    胡风早就对它的党羽说过：“许多人等于带上了枷，……小媳妇一样，经常怕挨打”，文艺领域“并不能把它当作什么阵地”。现在，我们明白了。胡风集团是要夺得他们的“解放区”，而不是什么文艺领域。他们的所谓“解放区”是什么样的“解放区”呢？这就是我们要问到底的。
    从“第二批材料”中看到，胡风把批评“文艺报”的错误，当作是他千载难逢的时机（“抓到的一个缺口”），他们早已磨好了剑，窥测好方向了，号召这个集团潜伏在各地的“大将军”、小喽啰们，兴风作浪：上意见书，写匿名信，变换投寄地点，假造读者意见，化名写文章，等等，“用集束手榴弹的战法”，从明处，从暗处，从各个方面的角落里掷出来。这就是这个集团所谓的“遍山旗帜”。在去年十月中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团扩大联席会议前夕，胡风集团已事前作好了战斗准备，检查了武器（研究发言提纲），号召采取一致行动，全面进攻。胡风的党羽之一徐放应声叫喊：“全军覆没，在所不惜！”
    但是，胡风及其党羽们忘记了一句中国的古话：“玩火者自焚”。马克思主义理论战线，立即向这个阴谋集团发起了猛烈的反击。三几个回合，胡风的尾巴露出来了。胡风看到兆头不妙了，一方面马上“收兵”写假检讨（“我的自我批判”），另一方面指示党羽们积极参加批判会，写
  “批判文章”来掩护退却。另从胡风复示他的一个暗藏在某编辑部里的党徒的话，就可以了解“检讨”是包藏着什么阴谋。胡风对这个党徒说：他们（某编辑部）叫你写批判我的文章，“你不写，炮火都引到你身上。但是，你要写得叫他们不能用！”这个反革命集团，对党、对人民是多么仇恨啊！它们是在“保存力量”，以便伺机再起！
    现在，我们明白了不少事情。但是，我们还要问：胡风及其集团，到底在搞什么鬼？我们要一层层地追，一层层地查，把这个反革命集团的底子追查出来！
