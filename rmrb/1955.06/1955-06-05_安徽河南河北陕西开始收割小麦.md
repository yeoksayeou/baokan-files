    Anhui, Henan, Hebei, and Shaanxi provinces have begun harvesting wheat, and wheat yields in various regions are generally higher than last year. In Anhui Province, early-maturing crops such as barley, peas, and broad beans are nearing the end of their harvest. Wheat harvesting has generally begun in areas south of the Yangtze River and between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, while it has just begun in various parts of northern Anhui. In Anhui Province, the sown area of crops such as wheat, barley, and potatoes increased by 17% compared to last year due to the implementation of "Three Reforms" throughout the province last winter and this spring, which promoted increasing the proportion of summer harvest crops to avoid disasters and ensure harvests. The wheat area alone increased by more than 2.3 million mu. According to estimates from various regions, the total yield of summer harvest crops in the province this year may increase by 1.4 billion jin compared to last year, and by 2.6 billion jin compared to 1953.
    In Henan Province, the more than 70 million mu of wheat are growing better than last year. Both sides of the Yellow River and Huai River, and both sides of the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai railways, are filled with the joy of harvest. In the Yellow River irrigation area, farmers are simultaneously harvesting wheat and planting autumn crops on more than 400,000 mu of wheat fields. On both banks of the Ying River in the Yellow River flood area, the yield of wheat per mu may exceed the original plan by more than ten jin. In Xihua County alone, the 1.08 million mu of wheat are estimated to yield more than 151 million jin, with an average increase of about 30 jin per mu compared to last year. In Shangshui County, large areas of low-lying land along the Fen River, which used to suffer from frequent floods, have seen wheat growing better than in many years due to the vigorous support of the People's Government in dredging the Fen River channel and eliminating waterlogging. The wheat in all six state-owned mechanical farms and more than 100 local state-owned farms in the province is also growing very well. The wheat harvesting work in various farms has now begun successively.
    In Hebei Province, the 11,540 mu of wheat in more than 80 state-owned farms are expected to reach an average yield of 162 jin per mu, which is about 50% higher than the average wheat yield in Hebei Province. Currently, the wheat in various state-owned farms in Handan, Xingtai, and other southern regions has matured, and the staff of each farm are preparing for harvesting.
    In Shaanxi Province, the average wheat yield per mu can reach 142.7 jin. The wheat yields in counties such as Binxian, Changwu, Xunyi, and counties in the Ankang area have exceeded last year's yields. Wugong County and Qishan County, which have consistently created large-area high yields, can reach last year's yield, with an estimated average yield of more than 290 jin per mu. Most state-owned farms in the Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi major wheat-producing areas can reach or exceed last year's yields. Currently, farmers in various regions are harvesting wheat intensively. They have put forward the slogan of careful harvesting and threshing to strive for every grain to return home.

    安徽河南河北陕西开始收割小麦
    本报讯　安徽、河南、河北、陕西等地已经开始收割小麦，各地小麦产量一般都比去年增加。安徽省早熟作物大麦、豌豆、蚕豆等，即将收割完毕。小麦在江南和江淮之间已经普遍开镰，淮北各地则刚刚开始收割。安徽省去冬今春因为在全省推行了“三改”，提倡增加夏收作物比重，以避灾保收，所以小麦、大麦、马铃薯等作物的播种面积比去年增加了百分之十七，其中小麦面积增加了二百三十多万亩。据各地估计，全省今年夏收作物产量比去年可增加十四亿斤，比一九五三年可增加二十六亿斤。
    河南全省七千多万亩小麦长得比去年还好。黄河、淮河两岸，京汉、陇海铁路两侧，到处洋溢着丰收的喜悦。引黄灌溉区四十多万亩麦田里，农民正在一边收麦，一边种秋。在黄泛区的颍河两岸，小麦每亩产量可超过原计划十斤以上，仅西华县的一百零八万亩小麦估计可收一亿五千一百多万斤，每亩平均约可比去年增产三十斤左右，商水县汾河岸边过去常年遭受水灾的大片低洼地，今年由于人民政府大力扶植当地农民疏浚了汾河河道，排除了内涝，小麦长得为多年所罕有。全省六个国营机械农场，和一百多个地方国营农场的小麦也都长得很好。各场的麦收工作现在已经陆续展开了。
    河北省八十多个国营农场的一万一千五百四十亩小麦，预计每亩平均产量可以达到一百六十二斤，约超过河北省麦田平均产量百分之五十。现在南部邯郸、邢台等地各国营农场小麦已经成熟，各场职工正在准备收割。
    陕西全省小麦平均每亩产量可达到一百四十二点七斤。邠县、长武、栒邑等县和安康专区各县的小麦超过去年产量。连年创造大面积丰产的武功县和岐山县，可以达到去年的产量，预计每亩平均可收二百九十斤以上。关中和陕南主要产麦区的大部分国营农场，可以达到和超过去年的产量。现在，各地农民正在紧张地收割小麦。他们提出了细收细打，争取颗粒还家的口号。
