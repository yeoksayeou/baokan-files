There are many ways to save construction funds in basic construction work. Fully mobilizing the internal resources of construction units and quickly applying these funds to national construction is an important aspect of saving construction funds.

The potential of internal resources in basic construction units in the Shanxi area is currently very large. This can be seen from the following three aspects: First, the backlog of construction materials is serious. According to statistics from the Shanxi Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China in April this year, the total value of various construction materials backlogged by only fifty-four state-owned and local state-owned factory and mining construction units and other construction units in the province (including materials transferred from last year and new backlogs created in the first quarter of this year) is equivalent to approximately 16 percent of the 1955 basic construction investment plan of the aforementioned fifty-four construction units. Second, the basic construction units prepared the annual financial revenue and expenditure plan for 1955 before the 1954 financial settlement was compiled. The estimates of the surplus funds of the construction units in 1954 were low; according to the statistics of fourteen state-owned construction units, the estimated amount was about 16 percent lower. It should be particularly pointed out that the portion of the 1954 surplus funds planned to be used by these fourteen units accounted for only about 75 percent of the actual amount that could be used. Third, the surplus funds of completed projects and the surplus circulating funds of the construction units are also important components of internal resources. If these internal resources are fully mobilized and the construction funds are fully utilized, a large amount of national basic construction investment can be saved. According to the results of the People's Construction Bank of China Shanxi Branch's inspection of sixty-three construction units in Shanxi Province, the amount of internal funds that can be mobilized is, on average, equivalent to one-fifth of the investment in this year's basic construction plan of these units. That is to say, if each construction unit can conscientiously mobilize internal resources and use them in this year's construction projects, then one-fifth of the investment of these sixty-three construction units this year does not need to be taken from the national treasury.

The leaders of the basic construction units in the Shanxi area generally attach importance to mobilizing internal resources, rationally using national construction funds, and saving national basic construction investment. Especially after the struggle to practice strict economy and oppose waste, this issue has attracted the attention of the leaders of many units. Many construction units have actively strengthened financial management work and disposed of backlogged construction materials and sluggish materials. Some units have formulated plans and indicators for mobilizing internal resources and submitted them to higher-level competent departments to revise the annual basic construction financial revenue and expenditure budget plan. Fourteen state-owned construction units in Shanxi Province have currently determined that the internal resources to be mobilized account for an average of about 30 percent of the basic construction investment plan of these fourteen units this year. Another twenty-two local state-owned construction units have currently determined that the internal resources to be mobilized account for an average of about 23 percent of the basic construction investment plan of these twenty-two units this year. The internal resources planned to be mobilized by the state-owned Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant this year account for 122 percent of the factory's basic construction investment plan for this year, that is, in addition to the fact that this year's basic construction work does not need to use funds from the national treasury, a portion of funds can also be turned over to the state. This positive attitude and practice is very correct and necessary.

However, at present, the leaders of many construction units still do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of mobilizing internal resources, rationally using national construction funds, and saving national basic construction investment. They have a strong sense of departmentalism and the erroneous thinking of "planning loosely and using sparingly" and "planning loosely and using loosely." Some construction units not only do not strengthen financial management work and actively dispose of backlogged materials, but also blindly apply for allocation and purchase of materials. The No. 212 Geological Exploration Team of the North China Geological Bureau in Shanxi Province is an example. Because this team's financial management work was not done well, the total value of materials backlogged in 1954 was equal to 64.5 percent of the 1955 investment plan. Although the team had processed some of these backlogged materials in the first quarter of this year, it did not conscientiously improve its management work, and blindly applied for allocation and procurement of materials this year. For example, in the first quarter of this year, they applied to higher-level leading organs for the allocation of 86,763 cubic meters of wood, and also purchased a large amount of wood in Taiyuan. After the purchase, they did not promptly report to the higher-level leading organs to stop the allocation of materials, resulting in a backlog of wood worth 8,926 yuan. The state-owned Datong Mining Bureau also has a similar situation. In addition, individual unit leaders have violated the financial system and have not handled the mobilized funds in accordance with regulations. For example, the local state-owned Xinzhi Coal Mine has actually diverted more than 80 percent of the basic construction surplus funds to production. This practice is wrong and cannot be allowed.

Mobilizing internal resources and saving national construction funds is a problem that all construction units should pay special attention to in the current anti-waste struggle, and it is also a problem that all construction units should always pay attention to. Because the purpose of mobilizing internal resources is to rationally use national construction funds and give full play to the effectiveness of the funds. To this end, construction units must not only actively handle existing internal resources, but also take various measures in their daily work to avoid excessive internal resources in the enterprise, because excessive internal resources in the enterprise is itself a waste of national construction funds.

    充分动员基本建设单位的内部资源
    吕光辰  杨荣昌
    在基本建设工作中节约建设资金的门路是很多的。充分动员建设单位的内部资源，使这些资金迅速运用到国家建设事业上，就是节约建设资金的一个重要方面。
    山西地区各基本建设单位目前内部资源的潜力是很大的。这可以从以下三个方面看出来。一是建筑器材的积压现象严重。据中国人民建设银行山西省分行今年四月份统计，全省仅五十四个国营和地方国营厂矿建设单位和其他建设单位所积压的各种建筑器材（包括由去年接转下来的材料和今年第一季度新造成的积压），其总值就相当于上述五十四个建设单位一九五五年基本建设计划投资的百分之十六左右。二是各基本建设单位在一九五四年财务决算尚未编出前就编制了一九五五年年度财务收支计划，各建设单位对一九五四年的结余资金的估计是偏低的，根据十四个国营建设单位的统计，约低估百分之十六。还应该特别指出的是：这十四个单位对一九五四年结余资金计划运用的部分仅占实际能够运用额的百分之七十五左右。三是各建设单位已完工程的结余资金、超余的流动资金等等也是构成内部资源的重要部分。如果把这些内部资源充分动员起来，使建设资金充分发挥作用，就能够节省国家大量的基本建设投资。根据中国人民建设银行山西省分行检查山西省六十三个建设单位的结果，认为目前可以动员的内部资金数额，平均相当于这些单位今年基本建设计划投资的五分之一。这就是说，如果各建设单位能够认真地动员内部资源，把它利用在今年的建设工程上，则这六十三个建设单位今年的五分之一的投资，可以不从国库里拿钱。
    山西地区各基本建设单位的领导人员，对动员内部资源，合理使用国家建设资金一般是重视的，特别在开展厉行节约、反对浪费现象的斗争以后，这一问题更引起许多单位领导人员的注意。许多建设单位都积极加强财务管理工作，处理积压的建筑器材和呆滞物资。有的单位拟定了动员内部资源的计划和指标，并报请上级主管部门修改本年度的基本建设财务收支预算计划。山西省有十四个国营建设单位目前已确定动员的内部资源，平均占这十四个单位今年基本建设投资计划的百分之三十左右，另有二十二个地方国营建设单位目前已确定动员的内部资源，平均占这二十二个单位本年度基本建设投资计划的百分之二十三左右。国营太原重型机器厂今年计划动员的内部资源，就占这个厂今年基本建设计划投资额的百分之一百二十二，即除今年的基本建设工作不必动用国库的资金外，还可上缴一部分资金。这种积极态度和做法是非常正确的和必要的。
    但是，目前也还有不少建设单位的领导人员对动员内部资源，合理使用国家建设资金，节省国家基本建设投资的意义认识不足。他们有浓厚的本位主义思想和“宽打窄用”、“宽打宽用”的错误思想。有的建设单位不仅不加强财务管理工作，积极处理积压器材，而且仍在盲目申请调拨和购置材料。在山西省的华北地质局二一二地质勘探队就是一个例子。这个队由于财务管理工作做得不好，一九五四年积压的材料总值就等于一九五五年投资计划的百分之六十四点五。这些积压的材料，这个队在今年第一季度虽已处理了一部分，但因为没有认真改进管理工作，今年以来又盲目申请调拨和采购材料。如今年第一季度他们向上级领导机关申请调拨木材八万六千七百六十三立方公尺，同时又在太原大量采购木材，在采购后又没有及时呈报上级领导机关停止拨料，结果积压的木材共值八千九百二十六元。国营大同矿务局也有类似的情况。另外也有个别单位的领导人员违犯财政制度，对已动员的资金不按规定处理，如地方国营辛置煤矿竟将百分之八十以上的基本建设结余资金挪用到生产上。这种作法是错误的，不能允许的。
    动员内部资源，节省国家建设资金是当前各建设单位在反浪费斗争中应特别注意的问题，也是各建设单位应该经常注意的问题。因为动员内部资源的目的在于合理地使用国家建设资金，发挥资金的效果。为此，建设单位不仅要积极处理现有的内部资源，而且要在日常工作中采取各种措施避免造成企业内部资源过多的现象，因为企业内部资源过多本身就是对国家建设资金的浪费。
