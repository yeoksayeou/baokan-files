    Current Problems in Jiangsu Province Handicraft Cooperative Organizations
    Zhou Zhesheng

    Jiangsu Province has more than one hundred types of handicraft industries, with approximately 860,000 employees. By the end of 1954, the province had organized 405 production cooperatives, 16 supply and marketing production cooperatives, and more than 780 production groups in 65 industries. There were over 74,000 members and group members, accounting for 8.6% of the workforce, an increase of 66% compared to 1953. The total value of production increased by 32% compared to 1953, with agricultural implements increasing more than threefold, lime and bricks and tiles more than doubling, and cotton cloth and socks also increasing by 9%. Due to the division of labor and cooperation after organization, the rational organization of the labor force increased production, increased income, improved technology, and reduced costs, demonstrating its superiority in overcoming production difficulties and complying with national plans.

    Jiangsu Province handicraft cooperatives also have many shortcomings, mainly in some areas that the organizational form is too large and ambitious, attacking and ostracizing individual handicraftsmen, and the capitalistic ideas in business operations.

    Looking at the 160 newly developed production cooperatives in 59 counties and cities, 78 of them have 30 to 100 people, and 17 have more than 100 people, with the largest having 200 people. This situation has brought many problems to the handicraft cooperative organizations. Many societies and groups have no leading cadres after being organized, and political and ideological leadership is weak. More than 100 production societies and groups in the Xuzhou area do not have a single Party branch, and many societies do not have Party members. There are discords between members and between group members, and labor discipline is lax. Also, due to rapid development, there was no serious understanding of the situation, and the organization is impure. In production societies and groups in Kunshan and Taicang counties, there are Yiguandao altar masters, counter-revolutionaries, landlords, and capitalists, who have usurped leadership. Some members of societies and groups were swept into the mass movement and have no ideological basis. After joining the societies and groups, their thinking wavers, and they clamor to withdraw from the societies and groups. For example, when Hupu in Changshu County developed handicraft cooperative organizations, a large meeting was held one night, and the director of the supply and marketing cooperative made a report. After the meeting, handicraftsmen were asked to sign up and apply to join the society. Before long, some members clamored to withdraw from the society.

    Regarding the treatment of individual handicraftsmen, some handicraft cooperative organizations do not unite and help them but attack and ostracize them. They put forward wrong slogans such as "Organizing is the way to survive, not organizing is the way to die" and "Working alone, working alone, will fail sooner or later." They also wrongly believe that "To organize them, we must first squeeze them out, otherwise the superiority of the production cooperative cannot be shown," and "If we squeeze them out, it will be easier to lead them, and the wavering of the members will disappear." Therefore, in terms of raw material supply, they generally only take care of those who are organized and do not take care of individual handicraftsmen; and they intentionally lower product prices to attack and ostracize individual handicraftsmen. In order to develop the wood industry production cooperative, Chuansha County controlled all the raw materials, making it impossible for individual handicraftsmen to work. Some societies in Wujiang County work overtime and hire temporary workers to complete processing tasks, without distributing some of the tasks to individual handicraftsmen. Some societies refuse the membership requests of individual handicraftsmen under the pretext of "We are in the rectification stage" and "We want to develop steadily."

    Capitalist business thinking is mainly manifested in neglecting the needs of urban and rural people, falsely reporting costs, and producing shoddy products. Some societies and groups like to produce large products with high output value and high profits, and are not active in producing products with small output value, low profits, but needed by the masses. The urban wood industry production cooperative in Jingjiang County does not produce agricultural implements during the season when farmers urgently need them, but produces coffins and furniture, because agricultural implements have a small output value, low profits, and scattered products; coffins and furniture are large products with high output value and high profits. As a result, large agricultural implements produced in Wujiang and other counties have been stockpiled for a long time, the working capital of the production cooperative is difficult, and the small agricultural implements needed by the masses are not available, affecting agricultural production. Some societies and groups also emphasize special treatment and over-report costs when signing contracts with state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives. When the Xinfeng Iron and Wood Industry Production Cooperative in Dantu County signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, the iron used for each sickle was reported as eight taels, while it was seven taels. Among the water bottle shells shipped by the Suzhou Bamboo Ware Production Cooperative to the Dalian Industrial Bureau, 1,400 dozen were moldy and deteriorated, and the shell bodies were soft. According to the statistics of 79 societies and groups, shoddy work and cutting corners accounted for 40%.

    The existence of the above problems is due to the Party organization's insufficient attention to the socialist transformation of handicrafts, and the fact that the handicraft leading departments and their staff members have not acted in accordance with the Party's policies and guidelines for the socialist transformation of handicrafts. The members of the handicraft cooperative organizations have just been transformed from individual handicraftsmen, and their own capitalist spontaneous tendencies have not been eliminated. If political and ideological education is neglected, they are most likely to accept the influence of capitalist business thinking, causing deviations in the business operations of the societies and groups. At the same time, the internal production management system, strict production responsibility system, product inspection system, and raw material storage system of the societies and groups have not yet been established and improved, which is also an important reason.

    The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has analyzed and criticized these problems in the handicraft work and has instructed all localities to establish and improve handicraft leading institutions, strengthen the political and ideological work of handicraftsmen, strengthen investigation and research, clarify the situation, conduct industry sorting, correctly formulate various plans, carry out comprehensive arrangements in the spirit of overall consideration, and earnestly consolidate existing societies and groups.

    江苏省手工业合作组织当前存在的问题
    周哲生
    江苏省有一百多种手工业行业，从业人员约八十六万多人。到一九五四年年底，全省在六十五个行业中组织了四百零五个生产合作社，十六个供销生产社，和七百八十多个生产小组。社员和组员有七万四千多人，占从业人员的百分之八点六，比一九五三年增加百分之六十六。生产总值比一九五三年增加百分之三十二，其中农具的生产总值增加三倍多，石灰和砖瓦增加一倍多，棉布和袜子也增加了百分之九。由于组织起来后分工协作，合理组织了劳动力，因而增加了生产，增加了收入，提高了技术，降低了成本，在克服生产困难和服从国家计划等方面，都显示了它的优越性。
    江苏省手工业合作社也存在不少缺点，主要是有些地区在组织形式上贪高贪大，打击和排挤个体手工业者，以及业务经营上的资本主义思想。
    从五十九个县、市新发展的一百六十个生产合作社来看，三十人到一百人的就有七十八个，一百人以上的有十七个，最多的有两百人。这种情况，给手工业合作组织带来了不少问题。很多社和组组织起来后没有领导骨干，政治思想领导薄弱。徐州专区一百多个生产社、组没有一个党支部，很多社没有党员，社员和社员、组员和组员之间闹不团结，劳动纪律松懈。还有由于迅速发展，没有认真了解情况，组织不纯的。昆山和太仓等县生产社、组中有一贯道坛主、反革命分子、地主和资本家，且有篡夺领导权的。有些社、组员被大呼隆的浪潮卷进来的，没有思想基础，入社入组后思想动摇，闹着退出社、组。如常熟县浒浦发展手工业合作组织时，一个晚上开了一个大会，由供销社主任做了一个报告，会后就要手工业者报名，申请入社，过了不久，有些社员就吵着要退社。
    在对待个体手工业者的问题上，有些手工业合作组织不是团结和帮助他们，而是打击和排挤他们。提出“组织起来是生路，不组织起来是死路”、
  “单干、单干，迟早完蛋”等错误口号。且错误地认为“要组织他们，必先挤垮他们，否则显示不了生产合作社的优越性”，“挤垮了他们，就容易领导他们，社员的动摇性就没有了”。因而在原料供应上，一般是只照顾组织起来的，不照顾个体手工业者；并有意压低产品价格，打击和排挤个体手工业者。川沙县城区为了发展木业生产合作社，将原料全部控制起来，使个体手工业者没活可干。吴江县有的社加工任务完不成开夜车、雇临时工，而不分一部分任务给个体手工业者。有些社借口“我们是整顿阶段”、“我们要稳步发展”，拒绝个体手工业者的入社要求。
    资本主义经营思想主要表现在忽视城乡人民需要，虚报成本，粗制滥造等方面。有些社、组喜欢生产产值大、利润高的大件产品，对产值小、利润低而为群众需要的产品不积极生产。靖江县城区木业生产合作社在农民急需农具的季节里，不生产农具，而生产棺材和家具，因为农具产值小、利润低、产品零碎；棺材和家具是大件产品，产值大、利润高。结果吴江等县生产的大型农具长期积压，生产合作社流动资金困难，而群众需要的小型农具没有，影响到农业生产。也有一些社、组和国营公司、供销社签订合同时，强调特殊，多报成本。丹徒县辛丰铁木业生产合作社和供销合作社订合同时，镰刀用铁每把七两，却报八两。苏州市竹器生产合作社运到旅大市工业局的水瓶壳中有一千四百打发霉变质，壳身发软。根据七十九个社、组的统计，粗制滥造和偷工减料的占百分之四十。
    上述问题的存在，是由于党组织对手工业社会主义改造工作重视不够，手工业领导部门和这些部门的工作人员没有根据党对手工业社会主义改造的方针政策办事。手工业合作组织的成员都是刚刚从个体手工业转来，本身资本主义自发倾向没有清除，如果忽视进行政治思想教育，则最易接受资本主义经营思想的影响，在社、组的业务经营上造成偏差。同时，社、组内部还没有建立和健全的生产管理制度和严格的生产责任制、产品检验制，和原材料保管等制度，也是一个重要的原因。
    中共江苏省委员会对手工业工作中存在的这些问题进行了分析和批判，已指示各地建立和健全手工业领导机构，加强对手工业者的政治思想工作，加强调查研究，摸清情况，进行行业排队，正确制定各种计划，在统筹兼顾的精神下，进行全面安排，并认真巩固现有社和组。
