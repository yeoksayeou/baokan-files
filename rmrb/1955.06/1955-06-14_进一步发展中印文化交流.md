    An Indian cultural delegation has come to our country from our great neighbor India. This is a major event in the growing friendly relations and cultural exchange between the two great nations and peoples of China and India, and it is also of great significance for maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.
    China and India are both ancient countries in the world, and at the same time they are both young countries. In the past, for two or three thousand years, there have been close and friendly cultural and economic ties between the two countries. As Premier Zhou Enlai said, "For century after century, history has recorded peaceful cultural exchange and economic exchanges between our two countries, but has never recorded war and hatred." At present, both of our countries have established their young countries from the struggle against colonialist aggression and oppression. As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out, "Now the people of both our countries share the desire for a peaceful international environment and for building their own countries. The people of both our countries are also struggling to continue to oppose foreign interference, to get rid of economic backwardness, and to realize complete national independence." These historical and current conditions constitute the foundation of the profound friendship between China and India.
    It is particularly important that in recent years, due to the conscious efforts of the people of the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China and the cooperation of the two governments in many international affairs, the friendly relations between the two countries have greatly developed. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India in June 1954 and Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China in October further strengthened and developed the friendly relations between the two countries.
    Under these circumstances, the cultural exchange between China and India has also been further developed. In 1951 and 1954, Chinese cultural delegations visited India twice; in 1952, an Indian cultural delegation also visited China. Through the activities of these cultural envoys, not only has the contact and exchange of cultural and artistic work between the two countries been strengthened, but the understanding between the peoples of the two countries has also been greatly enhanced. Now, shortly after the successful conclusion of the Asian-African Conference, the Indian cultural delegation has been invited to visit China again. This shows that under the common desire of the two major neighbors, China and India, to maintain and consolidate peace in Asia and the world, the prospect of development of cooperation between the two countries in various fields is extremely broad. This is why the Indian cultural delegation has received a sincere and warm welcome from the Chinese people.
    Historically, Indian culture and art have had a profound influence on Chinese culture and art, and Chinese culture and art have also had a profound influence on Indian culture and art. Today, we can still clearly see the traces of mutual learning and influence between the cultures and arts of the two countries on the basis of their respective national characteristics. The Indian cultural delegation is currently performing in Beijing. From the rich, colorful, technically profound, and nationally distinctive music and dance performances, the vast audience in the capital deeply and excitedly feels the profound emotions and great potential of this ancient and young nation. It is natural for the broad masses of Chinese audiences to give a warm welcome and high evaluation to the performances of the Indian cultural delegation. Chinese artists should especially take this opportunity to learn from the Indian cultural delegation, to learn their beautiful and precious art, to enrich and improve our own artistic creation.
    We firmly believe that all beautiful art is the voice of the people, conforms to the people's desire for peace, and serves the fundamental interests of human peace, happiness, and prosperity. In this sense, we respect and welcome the beautiful art created by the Indian people. We firmly believe that, just like the great Indian people who created this art, it has made and will continue to make a significant contribution to peace in Asia and the world.
    After visiting and performing in Beijing, the Indian cultural delegation will go to many cities in our country for visits and performances. We believe that they will receive the same welcome and love from the people of all parts of our country, and their work will be a great success.

    进一步发展中印文化交流
    印度文化代表团从我们伟大的邻邦印度来到了我国。这是中印两个伟大国家和人民的友好关系和两国文化交流日益发展中的一件大事，这对于维护和巩固亚洲和世界和平也有重要的意义。
    中印两国都是世界上的古老的国家，同时又都是年青的国家。就过去而言，两三千年以来两国之间就有着密切而友好的文化和经济的联系，这正如周恩来总理所说，“一个世纪又一个世纪，在我们两国之间，历史记录了和平的文化交流和经济来往，但是从来没有记录过战争和仇恨。”就目前而言，我们两国都从反抗殖民主义侵略和压迫的斗争中建立了自己的年青的国家。也正如周恩来总理指出的：“现在我们两国人民都同样抱有争取和平的国际环境和建设自己国家的愿望。我们两国人民又都在为继续反对外来干涉、摆脱经济落后、实现国家的完全独立而斗争。”这些历史的和现实的条件，就构成了中印两国之间的深厚友谊的基础。
    特别重要的是近几年来，由于印度共和国和中华人民共和国的人民自觉的努力和两国政府在许多国际事务中的合作，使两国的友谊关系有了很大的发展。一九五四年六月间我国周恩来总理应邀访问印度和十月间印度尼赫鲁总理应邀访问我国，这就进一步使两国的友谊关系更加亲密和更加发展。
    在这种情况之下，中印两国的文化交流也有了进一步的发展。一九五一年和一九五四年我国文化代表团曾两次访问印度；一九五二年印度文化代表团也曾访问过我国。通过这些文化使节的活动，不仅加强了两国文化艺术工作的联系和交流，并且大大增进了两国人民之间的了解。现在，在亚非会议胜利结束之后不久，印度文化代表团又应邀来访问我国。这说明了中印两大邻国在维护和巩固亚洲和世界和平的共同愿望之下，两国间各方面合作的发展前途是极为远大的。这次印度文化代表团所以受到中国人民的衷心和热烈的欢迎，就是由于这个原故。
    在历史上，印度文化艺术曾经对我国文化艺术发生过深刻的影响，我国文化艺术也对印度文化艺术发生过深刻的影响。今天我们仍然能够清楚地看到两国文化艺术在各自的民族特色的基础上互相学习和影响的痕迹。目前印度文化代表团正在北京演出，首都的广大观众从那些丰富多采的、技术深湛的、民族风格突出的音乐舞蹈表演中，深刻地、兴奋地感到这个古老而年青的民族的深厚的感情和伟大的潜力。我国广大的观众对于印度文化代表团的演出，给予热情的欢迎和崇高的评价是很自然的。我国艺术工作者特别应该借此机会向印度文化代表团学习，学习他们的美好的宝贵的艺术，来丰富和提高我们自己的艺术创造。
    我们深信，一切美好的艺术都是人民的心声，都是符合于人民的和平愿望的，都是为人类的和平、幸福和昌盛的根本利益服务的。在这个意义上，我们尊重和欢迎印度人民所创造的美好的艺术。我们深信，它也正如创造了这种艺术的伟大的印度人民一样，是曾经并且还会对亚洲和世界和平作出重大的贡献。
    印度文化代表团在北京访问演出之后，就要到我国许多城市去进行访问和演出。我们相信他们一定会获得我国各地人民同样的欢迎和喜爱，他们的工作一定会获得巨大的成功。
