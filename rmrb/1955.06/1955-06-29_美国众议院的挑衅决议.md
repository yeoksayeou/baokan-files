    A Provocative Resolution by the U.S. House of Representatives
    Hu Jin

    On June 23rd, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution; a similar bill has also been submitted to the Senate. This bill, repeating the most shallow and reactionary rhetoric of so-called "Communist imperialism," insinuates and slanders socialist and people's democratic countries, attempting to portray socialism as a form of colonialism. At the same time, this resolution states that the United States has "always supported" other countries in "achieving self-government or independence," and that the U.S. will continue such "efforts" through various "relationships," "implementing its foreign policy and plans, and exerting its influence."

    This resolution once again proves that under the increasingly high-spirited struggle of people of all countries for peace, independence and freedom, the American diplomacy, which is increasingly forced into a corner, is still unwilling to start from a realistic estimate, but wants to resort to disguise, and resort to anti-communist hysterical clamoring.

    The purpose of the U.S. Congress in passing this bill is to resist the Asian-African Conference's resolution condemning colonialism. House Democratic Leader McCormack, who introduced the bill, said that the bill was a "supplement to the Bandung Conference." Not long ago, the extremely bellicose American aggressor, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Richards, who clamored for atomic war, also revealed Washington's mood by saying: "This bill is timely and urgent."

    It is necessary for Washington figures to make a "supplement" to the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, and it is also very "urgent" to do so, which shows that the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference do not suit Washington's taste, and also make it feel flustered. In fact, this has long been an open secret. The American propaganda machine made no secret of the fact that the United States originally hoped that some people at the Asian-African Conference would raise the issue of communist ideology to provoke disputes, disrupt the conference, and use the slander of communism to confuse the target of the Asian-African people's struggle against colonialism, so that the conference would not be able to pass resolutions condemning colonialism and supporting the struggle for independence and freedom. However, the United States' hope failed.

    As Prime Minister Nehru said in his report on the Asian-African Conference: "The conference unanimously condemned colonialism in the sense that everyone is familiar with, that is, one nation ruling another, and all the evils that come with it." At that time, some people, contrary to the facts, wanted to portray socialism as a form of colonialism, and wanted to include the relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries into the category of colonialism. However, Prime Minister Nehru said: "This view cannot become part of any program of the conference."

    The American ruling group cannot fail to see that the Asian-African Conference's resolution on opposing colonialism, as well as all its resolutions, especially the declaration on promoting world peace and cooperation, are in conflict with the policies pursued by the United States in the Asian and African regions. The Asian and African people are tightly holding the banner of striving for peace, national independence, and friendly cooperation in their own hands. The major countries in the Middle East and the people of the Middle East oppose the formation of an aggressive Middle East bloc. The major countries in Southeast Asia and the people of Southeast Asia oppose the Manila Treaty. These facts powerfully show that the Asian and African people are unwilling to be controlled by the United States and unwilling to be dragged into war by the United States. Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo once said: "Anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism are not slogans monopolized by communists, but living realities in the hearts of the vast people of Asia and Africa." Therefore, the attempt of the United States to slander so-called "Communist imperialism" while disguising itself as "supporting" "independence" and "autonomy" is a futile effort.

    Precisely because of this, the American diplomatic authorities are flustered, and the American Congress is also taking action. Since they cannot distort the Asian-African Conference's resolution against colonialism, they use the commonplace barbaric method of forcibly "supplementing" the Asian-African Conference's resolution, and distorting all manifestations of colonialism condemned by the Asian-African Conference into "Communist imperialism and other forms of colonialism," trying to replace the Asian-African Conference's resolution with the U.S. Congressional resolution.

    Secondly, the resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives even stipulates that the "independence" or "autonomy" supported by the United States should be "achieved under the condition of obtaining equal status among free countries in the world." This means that any country that wants to obtain "independence" or "autonomy" must be incorporated into the U.S. "free world" system, that is, the U.S. military bloc. As everyone knows, the United States regards its "free world" as one in which all countries must accept the domination and "protection" of the United States. These countries will not only not be able to talk about "independence" and "autonomy," but also not be able to talk about peace and security. If any country is unwilling to accept its domination and "protection," that is not allowed. The United States opposes peaceful neutrality and curses peaceful coexistence. The United States wants to exert various "influences" on many countries, interfere in their internal affairs, and even create coups. Recently, the United States' interference in the internal affairs of Indochina, Indonesia, and many countries in the Middle East is an example. In Latin America, after the United States subverted the independent and autonomous government of Guatemala, it successively created bloody coup events in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Argentina.

    The resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives shows that the United States wants to continue to attack the independent sovereignty of various countries, and wants to pull more countries into its "American world empire" in order to expand and deepen the division and antagonism of the world. This is actually a letter of challenge to the national interests and peace interests of various countries.

    McCormack, who proposed the bill, openly said: Once this bill is passed by the House, it "will surely become a message of hope and confidence to countless people, especially Asians and Africans." This is to make the Asian and African people not oppose colonialism, not strive for and maintain independence, freedom and peace, but should place "hope" and "confidence" in the United States. They think that they are omnipotent, and that they can offset the influence of the Asian-African Conference and reverse the trend of national awakening of the Asian and African people with a resolution.

    As usual, they underestimate the strength and demands of the people, and they will, as usual, run into snags.

### 美国众议院的挑衅决议

    美国众议院的挑衅决议
    胡今
    六月二十三日，美国众议院通过了一个决议案；同样的议案也已提交参议院。这个议案，重复所谓“共产党帝国主义”的最浅薄的反动谰言，来影射和诽谤社会主义和人民民主国家，想把社会主义说成是殖民主义的一种形式。同时，这个决议案却说什么美国是“一向支持”其他国家“实现自治或独立”的，美国要通过各方面的“关系”，“执行它的外交政策及计划，运用它的影响”，来继续进行这样的“努力”。
    这个决议案又一次证明：在各国人民争取和平和独立自由的日益高涨的斗争下，正日益被迫到墙角的美国外交，依然不愿从现实的估计出发，而想乞灵于伪装，乞灵于反共歇斯底里叫嚣。
    美国国会通过这个议案的目的，是为了抵制亚非会议谴责殖民主义的决议。提出这个议案的众议院民主党领袖麦考马克就说：这个议案是“对万隆会议的一种补充”。不久前还大肆叫嚣原子战争的极端好战的美国侵略分子、众议院外交委员会主席理查兹，还透露了华盛顿的心情说：“这个议案是适时的和紧迫的”。
    必须由华盛顿的人物来对亚非会议的决议作“补充”，而且又是十分“紧迫”地需要这样做，可见亚非会议的决议不合华盛顿的口胃，而且还使它感到慌张。事实上，这早已是公开的秘密。美国宣传机关毫不掩饰，美国原来指望亚非会议的一些人提出共产主义的思想意识问题来挑起纠纷，破坏会议，拿对共产主义的诬蔑来混淆亚非人民反对殖民主义的斗争对象，使会议不能通过谴责殖民主义和支持争取独立自由斗争的决议。但是，美国的这个指望落空了。
    正如尼赫鲁总理在关于亚非会议的报告中所说的：“会议一致谴责大家所熟知的那种意义上的殖民主义，即一个民族统治另一个民族，以及随之而来的一切邪恶。”当时有些人违反事实，想把社会主义说成是殖民主义的一种形式，想把苏联和人民民主国家间的关系列入殖民主义的范畴之内。但是尼赫鲁总理说：“这种意见不能成为会议的任何方案的一部分。”
    美国统治集团不能不看到：亚非会议关于反对殖民主义的决议，以及它的所有决议，其中特别是促进世界和平和合作的宣言，都是同美国在亚非地区推行的政策相冲突的。亚非人民正在紧紧地把争取和平、民族独立、友好合作的旗子高举在自己的手中。中东的主要国家和中东人民反对拼凑中东侵略集团。东南亚主要国家和东南亚人民反对马尼剌条约。这些事实有力地表明亚非人民不愿受美国的控制，不愿被美国拖入战争。印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约曾说：“反殖民主义和反帝国主义并不是共产党人所独占的口号，而是亚洲和非洲广大人民心中的活生生的现实。”因此，美国诽谤所谓“共产党帝国主义”，而伪装自己“支持”“独立”“自治”的这个企图，是枉费心机的。
    正是因为这样，美国外交当局着慌了，美国国会也行动起来了，他们既然歪曲不了亚非会议反殖民主义的决议，他们便使出司空见惯的横蛮手法来，硬要替亚非会议的决议作“补充”，把亚非会议谴责的一切表现的殖民主义，篡改为“共产党帝国主义及其他形式的殖民主义”，想用美国国会的决议案来代替亚非会议的决议。
    其次，美国众议院通过的决议案竟规定，美国所支持的“独立”或“自治”，应该在“取得在世界上的自由国家中的平等地位的情况下实现”。这就是说，任何国家要取得“独立”或“自治”，都必须纳入美国的“自由世界”体系即美国的军事集团之内。大家知道，美国是把它的“自由世界”看作是一切国家必须接受美国的支配和“保护”的。这些国家将不仅谈不到“独立”和“自治”，而且谈不到和平和安全。如果有哪一个国家不愿接受它的支配和“保护”，那是不行的。美国反对和平中立，咒诅和平共处。美国要对许多国家施行各种各样的“影响”，干涉它们的内政，甚至制造政变。最近以来，美国对印度支那、印度尼西亚和中东许多国家的内政的干涉活动，就是例证。在拉丁美洲，美国颠覆了危地马拉独立自主的政府以后，还连续制造了哥斯达黎加、巴西、阿根廷的流血政变事件。
    美国众议院通过的决议案表明，美国要继续向各国的独立主权进攻，要把更多的国家拉进它的“美利坚世界帝国”之内，以扩大和加深世界的分裂和对立。这实际上是对各国民族利益及和平利益的挑战书。
    提出议案的麦考马克公开说：这个议案一经众院通过，“必将成为给无数人、特别是亚洲人和非洲人，带来希望和信心的信息”。这就是要使亚非人民不要反对殖民主义，不要去争取和维护独立、自由和平，而应把“希望”和“信心”寄托在美国的身上。他们以为，他们是万能的，他们能够凭一纸决议，抵消亚非会议的影响，扭转亚非人民的民族觉醒的趋势。
    他们照例是这样过低估计人民的力量和要求的，他们也照例要碰钉子。
