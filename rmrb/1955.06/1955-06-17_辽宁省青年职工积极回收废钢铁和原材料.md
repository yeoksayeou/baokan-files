Liaoning Province's young workers have achieved significant results in utilizing their spare time to recycle scrap steel and raw materials. According to incomplete statistics, more than 44,000 young workers throughout the province are now participating in this activity. Young workers in seven cities, including Anshan, Lüda, Fuxin, Benxi, Jinzhou, Liaoyang, and Yingkou, as well as the Xiu Yan Lead Mine, have already recovered more than 50,000 tons of scrap steel, more than 800 tons of non-ferrous metals, more than 1,900 tons of coal, and thousands of tools and large quantities of other raw materials. The Du Shaozhong Youth Advanced Production Group of the Anshan General Repair Factory found a hoist capable of lifting 20 tons in a pile of scrap iron. Young people in Fuxin City salvaged a discarded 70-horsepower water pump and many seamless steel pipes, drill bits, and other equipment. Young workers at the Yingkou Textile Factory recovered more than 10,000 machine parts, 37 of which were urgently needed for production. The Youth Supervision Post of the Engineering Section of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine also put forward more than 30 rationalization proposals in just over a month, helping the administration establish 21 management systems and plug some loopholes of waste.

    辽宁省青年职工积极回收废钢铁和原材料
    辽宁省青年职工利用业余时间回收废钢铁和原材料的活动已经有显著成绩。据不完全统计，现在全省有四万四千多名青年职工参加了这项活动。鞍山、旅大、阜新、本溪、锦州、辽阳、营口等七个市和岫岩铅矿的青年职工们，已经回收了五万多吨废钢铁、八百多吨有色金属、一千九百多吨煤和数千件工具、大批其他的原材料。鞍山总修理厂杜绍忠青年先进生产小组在废铁堆里找到一台能吊二十吨重的卷扬机。阜新市青年们拣回来一台被丢弃的七十马力的水泵和许多无缝钢管、钻头等器材。营口纺织厂青年职工回收了一万多件机器零件，其中有三十七种正是生产中迫切需要的机件。阜新海州露天煤矿工务段青年监督岗，还在一个多月时间内提出了三十多件合理化建议，帮助行政建立了二十一条管理制度，堵塞了一些浪费的漏洞。
