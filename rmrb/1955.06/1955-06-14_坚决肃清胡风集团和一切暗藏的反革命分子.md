**Resolutely Purge the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionaries**

The criminal acts of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group have given us a profound lesson. After the publication of three batches of materials, the hideous face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been exposed. The exposure is continuing. From the materials already published, it is clear that this is a brazen counter-revolutionary, anti-party, and anti-people event, far beyond a mere ideological issue. This is a major event that all the people of the nation should pay close attention to, not just a matter for the literary and artistic circles. Anyone with a conscience and courage, reading these three batches of materials, will be filled with indignation against this pack of wolves. Anyone who loves the country, the people, and our socialist cause, reading these three batches of materials, will sharpen their political instincts, heighten their political responsibility and vigilance, and thus be better able to distinguish between friends and enemies, more hate the enemies of the people, and at the same time, more love their own people and friends.

Hu Feng and his core members are nothing but a bunch of long-standing counter-revolutionaries who are anti-party and anti-people. The Hu Feng group does not just hate a few party leaders in the literary and artistic field; they hate all progressive literary and artistic workers within and outside the party. They do not just oppose our literary and artistic movements; they hate the entire revolutionary victory and hate the entire nation led by Chairman Mao. They use extremely despicable and cunning methods to infiltrate party organizations, state agencies, democratic parties, and people's organizations, spreading their tentacles to every large, medium, and small city, truly leaving no gap unexploited, no hole unentered. If the Hu Feng group's plots had succeeded, would the Chinese people have a future?

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China instructs us: To build our country into a great socialist state is a deeper and broader revolution than the one against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. It contains extremely complex and sharp struggles. Many people do not fully understand the content of these extremely complex and sharp struggles. The counter-revolutionary facts of the Hu Feng group serve as a painful lesson for all of us. When our strength is greater and our cause is more victorious, the enemy not only hates us more but also fears us more. "Living in danger, worrying deeply," is a saying that conforms to objective laws. The enemy's sabotage activities are not only more concealed but also, due to "deep worries," more "clever." They specialize in sabotage, have plenty of time, and can come up with endless plots and schemes. As long as we have a little self-satisfaction, and within that self-satisfaction, a little negligence and carelessness, thinking that "living in no danger" means "no deep worries," then the enemy's plots and schemes can take advantage of the situation. We must always keep our minds clear, think critically in every situation, and be accustomed to deep thinking and long-term planning to meticulously seal up all loopholes, making it impossible for the enemy to find any gaps or holes. However, what is even more important is to maintain closer ties with the masses, continuously improve the masses' political instincts, and constantly educate the broad masses to distinguish between the images of the people and the enemies, between the characters of the people and the enemies, and to be vigilant against the enemy's possible sabotage activities from all directions. This is the most reliable way to defend our country.

The people's eyes are sharp; does anyone still have doubts? The continued exposure of the counter-revolutionary facts of the Hu Feng group is not a living example? Today, any hidden behavior cannot be concealed forever. Obviously, counter-revolutionary activities are still being carried out in various aspects, and counter-revolutionaries are still hiding in every corner. The exposure of the Hu Feng case should awaken these people, making them consider whether to continue hiding, letting the sharp eyes of the people discover them, or to confess voluntarily. I think, as long as they understand our consistent principle of "leniency for those who confess," and realize that hiding is ultimately futile, they will find it better to confess voluntarily. We resolutely advocate an honest and upright style, oppose hypocritical deceit, and this is based on the spirit of materialism, unshakable.

There is a strict distinction between ideological issues and political issues in our country; there are no "ideological criminals." But as someone who wants to transform oneself into a socialist citizen, one should regard the Hu Feng group's incident as a "wake-up call." Check to see if there has ever been any sympathy in the depths of one's heart for Hu Feng's group. If there was, is there still any now? I think that among the business community, there are inevitably some who verbally support the general tasks of the transitional period but inwardly doubt or even oppose socialist transformation. There are even more who think that taking the socialist path is "inevitable" but have not yet considered it "natural," and reluctantly "go with the flow." The first type of person is also a kind of two-faced person, definitely secretly sympathizing with Hu Feng's group, and even expressing this sympathy to their "confidants"; the second type of person might think "it doesn't concern me, high and dry" or might also secretly sympathize with some parts of it. Should one sympathize or not? Is it "none of my business"? This is worth examining. There is another type of person who claims to have contributed to the revolution, wanting to reap benefits after the revolutionary victory, but failing to do so or not getting enough; there is another type who claims to have extraordinary abilities, feeling "underutilized" or "idle" now. These two types of people are not limited to the business community; they also include intellectuals; their common point is dissatisfaction and grumbling—not because they care about the people's cause but only for their own interests. Such people are worth being vigilant about! They are precisely the objects that the Hu Feng group wants to win over and attract.

The unity among the people must be actively expanded and consolidated. Only on the basis of expanding and consolidating unity can we isolate a few enemies, making it easier for millions of people's eyes to be vigilant against every action of the enemy. It is not superficial, baseless, polite, or superficial unity, but must gradually achieve sincere and loving unity through concrete analysis and in-depth mutual understanding. Because the broad masses have already been organized in various forms, we have the conditions to do this today. To deal with the increasingly "clever" plots and schemes of the enemy, we must do this. Sloppy methods are no longer suitable for today's times. We must unite as strongly as an iron wall, making the enemy hesitate to approach.

The complete annihilation of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is certain. Let us, on the basis of this great victory, more closely accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China and strive together to further purge all hidden counter-revolutionaries!

**Resolutely Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group**

By Wu Han

I have read the first, second, and third batches of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group consecutively, and I cannot suppress the anger in my heart, I am extremely angry and resentful!

The third batch of materials is irrefutable evidence that proves the reactionary political background of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. The Hu Feng group is not just some simple "literary and artistic group"; it is another guerrilla unit of the Chiang Kai-shek gang in mainland China, more treacherous and more ruthless than bandits, evil landlords, armed special agents, and spies. Hu Feng "linked up with" and "won over" a group of imperialist spies, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and turncoats, gathering the dregs of the old society. For twenty years, Hu Feng and the members of the Hu Feng group infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, wearing the mask of progress, launching vicious and tenacious attacks on the literary front, all revolutionary intellectuals, and the core force leading our revolution—the Communist Party of China, corrupting our revolutionary ideology, disintegrating our revolutionary organizations, and seizing our revolutionary positions. After liberation, they collaborated with the running dogs of American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan, and attempted to make counter-revolutionary forces revive in China. But they failed; their plots were exposed. The invincible power of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China is something that a handful of counter-revolutionary moles cannot estimate.

Materials exposed from various aspects are already abundant. I think it is necessary to supplement the exposure of the reactionary political background of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group from the following two issues.

First, the issue of the "Mud Society."

In 1947 and 1948, when the people's liberation war was achieving victory after victory, and the Chiang Kai-shek gang was brutally suppressing the democratic revolutionary movement, the literary magazine "Mud" edited by the Hu Feng group was widely circulated in the literary circles in northern China, especially in the universities of Beijing and Tianjin.

"Mud" wore the cloak of a progressive publication, sometimes publishing works by progressive writers, and cursing some reactionary literati who had obvious collusion with the Nationalist reactionaries, pretending to be progressive, and decorating the facade. However, in essence, it was a reactionary publication controlled by the Hu Feng group. Under the cloak of Marxism-Leninism theory, it published a large number of articles by Hu Feng and the core members of the Hu Feng group, such as A Cheng, Lu Ling, Shu Wu, Ji Han, and Niu Han, fervently promoting and peddling reactionary subjective idealism, with every page filled with reactionary theories such as "subjective fighting spirit," "self-expansion," and "personality power." In the magazine, they mutually praised and flattered each other, hated progressive writers, especially the Communist Party members who were then in Hong Kong editing the "Mass Literature Series," such as Hu Sheng, Qiao Guanhua, and Shao Yulin, and launched vicious attacks and curses.

Criticisms of "Mud" were slandered as "trivial theoretical... 'street cursing' style of writing." Critics of "Mud" were cursed as "praise-seeking critics" and "those who are used to being arrogant, a trio of scholars, rogues, and pseudo-scholars."

At that time, we felt there was a problem: why did "Mud" always disagree with our opinions and always oppose us completely. Recently, after reading the three batches of materials published in the "People's Daily," we finally realized the problem! From the facts exposed in the third batch of materials, it is completely proven that Hu Feng and the core members of the Hu Feng group, such as A Cheng and Lü Yuan, were originally Nationalist spies, reactionary officers, and those who listened to Chiang's "speeches" at the "Whampoa Military Academy," and those who worked at the "China-American Cooperation Society." The problem is completely clear.

From the recently exposed materials, it can also be said that before liberation, why our publications were so difficult to publish, being sealed up in a few days, while the publications of the Hu Feng group could pass through without obstruction and be everywhere. Why were progressive writers arrested and killed, while Hu Feng and his followers could safely travel between Shanghai and Hangzhou in 1948, the final days of the counter-revolutionary enemy's brutal suppression of the revolutionary movement? It turns out they were all in the same family, snakes in the same nest!

Next, the issue of Mr. Wen Yiduo joining the revolutionary ranks.

Mr. Wen Yiduo was my friend and comrade. Everyone knows that before and after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he actively and bravely participated in the democratic revolutionary movement that swept through the southwest at that time, and was hated by the reactionaries, finally sacrificing his life. As a representative of revolutionary intellectuals who bravely participated in the revolutionary struggle under the party's leadership, Mr. Wen Yiduo has long been respected, remembered, and learned from by the people.

The counter-revolutionary Hu Feng, on the one hand, wrote an article saying that "this assassination should be taken as a new signal of the reactionary attack," and on the other hand, shamelessly and maliciously slandered and cursed, "Wen Yiduo is of course opportunistic, but he succeeded, so he has to flatter him."

Many people know about Mr. Wen Yiduo's death, but many people are not quite clear about the circumstances under which Mr. Wen Yiduo participated in the revolutionary struggle.

I have the responsibility to clarify this situation.

I remember that at that time, Mr. Wen Yiduo was teaching at Southwest Associated University in Kunming. At that time, Kunming was shrouded in a terrifying atmosphere, special agents were rampant, assassinations and arrests were rampant; Japanese imperialism had occupied Hunan and Guizhou; the living standards of the people had plummeted sharply, and the people of the southwest faced immense danger and disaster. Many people were frightened, retreated, and prepared to escape. At this time, Mr. Wen Yiduo and we did a lot of work together. The Nationalist gang threatened to assassinate him. The atmosphere was very tense.

After Mr. Wen Yiduo joined the democratic revolutionary movement, his thoughts underwent a great change. With the pen and tongue of a poet and scholar, he adopted the attitude of "once out the door, never coming back," working day and night for the revolutionary cause until his heroic sacrifice, giving his life.

I want to explain that Mr. Wen Yiduo joined the revolutionary ranks in the atmosphere of terror created by the threats of the Nationalist gang to assassinate him.

Mr. Wen Yiduo joined the revolutionary ranks, and the Nationalist gang hated him to the core, using a silent American-made pistol to assassinate him; Mr. Wen Yiduo joined the revolutionary ranks, and Hu Feng also hated him to the core, cursing him as "opportunistic"! One used a gun, and the other used a pen, but their positions were the same. From this fact, can it not be proven that Hu Feng was a close ally of the Nationalist gang?

From the three batches of materials that have been exposed, it is clear that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been consistently hostile to the revolution and progressive forces. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, their evil deeds have not only not weakened but have become more rampant and tenacious. They collaborated with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek gang across the sea, formulated counter-revolutionary strategies and plans, and launched vicious attacks, hating everything in the new society, dreaming of the destruction of the people's revolutionary government. Are these ironclad facts not enough to reveal the counter-revolutionary political background of the Hu Feng group and to draw a conclusion about the nature of the Hu Feng group? No, it is completely enough, and it is time.

The party has sounded the alarm, and our work to expose the Hu Feng anti-party, anti-people, counter-revolutionary group has achieved initial victory. However, resolutely and thoroughly investigating and suppressing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, completely removing this abscess from the cause of the Chinese people's revolution, is still a major task for the people of the whole country in the future. Until the final victory, we will not stop fighting. This is the common will and determination of the people of the whole country. All members of the Hu Feng group must honestly and thoroughly confess to the people, await the people's disposal, and those who dare to resist and persist in error will be severely punished by the people.

**Resolutely Eliminate Hidden Counter-Revolutionaries**

By Wang Chonglun

I am an ordinary young lathe operator. In the past, I had never read Hu Feng's works and did not know who Hu Feng was. Now, after reading the three batches of materials published by the "People's Daily," I know that Hu Feng is a loyal running dog of Chiang Kai-shek, disguised as a revolutionary, infiltrating the revolutionary ranks, and long-term engaging in sabotage activities. He is the most vicious and treacherous enemy of the working class and the people of the whole country. I am extremely angry about the criminal activities of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary group and agree to thoroughly investigate the truth of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, revoke all of Hu Feng's positions and the qualifications of a delegate to the National People's Congress, and severely punish him according to law.

The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a great victory for the working class and the people of the whole country. However, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and similar counter-revolutionaries, their anti-party, anti-people, counter-revolutionary criminal activities are planned and step-by-step, and their methods are cunning and vicious. If we think that exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group means everything is fine, that is very dangerous. We must expose all hidden counter-revolutionaries and eliminate them; otherwise, we will not have a good life.

Whether in the past or now, the working class has always been at the forefront of the struggle. Our ideal is to quickly build our country into a socialist society. The incident of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group gives us the greatest lesson: to always be vigilant and prevent all hidden counter-revolutionary activities at any time, and give them a resolute and thorough blow. As long as we act in unison, no matter how cunning and hidden the counter-revolutionaries are, they will definitely be exposed and exposed by us. Only in this way can we defend the victory of our revolution.

**Patriotic Christians Must Double Their Vigilance**

By Chen Jianzhen

The "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, which cannot but make every anti-imperialist, patriotic Chinese Christian feel extremely angry. We must recognize the treachery, viciousness, and shamefulness of this criminal group, and at the same time, recognize the strength of the Chinese people. The Hu Feng group, who has long played the two-faced trick, and his anti-party, anti-people group, attempted to overthrow the people's revolutionary government and sabotage the socialist construction of the motherland. This shameful plot has been exposed in front of the Chinese people, which is a great victory in our socialist revolution. We Chinese Christians believe that Hu Feng's qualifications as a delegate to the National People's Congress should be immediately revoked; and Hu Feng and his followers should be given the punishment they deserve.

The exposure of the Hu Feng incident is a very profound education for us Chinese Christians. Because among us, many people do not recognize such hidden counter-revolutionaries; especially, the vigilance is not high, and sometimes the vigilance is even lost. Just take me as an example. When I saw the first batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, I still thought it was just an ideological issue, a problem in the literary and artistic circles, and did not recognize the great harm this group posed to the people of the whole country and the socialist construction of our country. This shows that in the future, we must strengthen our studies, improve our political instincts, and heighten our vigilance to unremittingly fight against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

For more than four years, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Christianity in China, with the support of the people of the whole country and the efforts of Christians across the country, has achieved definite victories. However, the imperialist elements who are not willing to give up are still everywhere, using various hidden and deceptive methods to attempt to sabotage our anti-imperialist, patriotic great unity. Therefore, we Christians across the country must double our vigilance, further strengthen our unity, expose all counter-revolutionaries hidden in our Christianity, and unite more closely with the people of the whole country to strive for the great cause of socialist transformation and construction.

**Strengthen National Unity, Smash Counter-Revolutionary Plots**

By Sangji Yexi

Recently, the "People's Daily" has continuously published materials that have completely exposed the anti-party, anti-people, hideous face of the Hu Feng group. It turns out that they are not just people with petty-bourgeois views but a counter-revolutionary group that conspires to sabotage our great family of the motherland, attempting to make the people of all ethnic groups return to the rule of imperialism and the Nationalist gang. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is the enemy of the people of all ethnic groups. We demand the revocation of Hu Feng's qualifications as a delegate to the National People's Congress and the resolute suppression of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

From this incident, we ethnic minorities should draw great lessons. Counter-revolutionaries are everywhere, especially in our Tibetan region, which is located in the remote border, and politics, economy, and culture are still backward. Counter-revolutionaries often take advantage of these situations, hiding in ethnic regions, wearing various disguises, inciting ethnic unity, causing ethnic internal strife, or carrying out extremely vicious sabotage activities to achieve the evil goal of sabotaging ethnic unity. Therefore, all cadres and people in the Tibetan region must be extremely vigilant, strengthen the study of Marxism and ethnic policies, strengthen unity among ethnic groups and within ethnic groups, smash all counter-revolutionary plots, and defend the happy great family of the motherland with ethnic unity.

**Severely Punish the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group According to Law**

By Wang Jiaxin

I am a natural scientist. In the past, I did not know Hu Feng and had never read his works. When the literary and artistic circles began to criticize Hu Feng, I was very complacent and did not pay much attention. It was not until I saw the first batch of materials exposed by the "People's Daily" about his counter-revolutionary group that I was greatly shocked and realized the extreme reactionary nature of the Hu Feng group. After seeing their second batch of anti-party, anti-people materials, my anger deepened, and I guessed that Hu Feng must have a reactionary political background. Indeed, the third batch of counter-revolutionary materials has been published, proving that Hu Feng is a spy for imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. He and his followers were able to hide in our revolutionary ranks for so long, which shows that their plots are extremely vicious and their tricks are extremely cunning. Hu Feng and his followers have caused a lot of harm to the revolutionary cause, deceiving many young people and local party organizations. We absolutely cannot tolerate this anymore and must quickly cleanse them from our revolutionary ranks, immediately revoke Hu Feng's qualifications as a delegate to the National People's Congress, and severely punish them according to law.

Since counter-revolutionaries can infiltrate the ranks of our literary and artistic workers, they can also infiltrate the ranks of our natural scientists. If we are still complacent and only focus on our work, neglecting politics, counter-revolutionaries will have the opportunity to infiltrate our ranks. Therefore, in the future, natural scientists need to be extremely vigilant, greatly strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, seriously and earnestly reform themselves, and closely unite around the Communist Party of China. Only in this way can we distinguish right from wrong and friends from enemies at any time and place, and thoroughly smash hidden counter-revolutionaries like Hu Feng.

**Everyone, Search for Spies**

By Yang Zhihua

The struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a serious class struggle. This is not a matter of expressing attitudes but of taking effective practical actions to search for counter-revolutionaries hiding in every corner until the counter-revolutionary group is completely smashed; therefore, this is a long-term and fierce class struggle!

As far back as more than twenty years ago, at the end of 1933, after Comrade Qu Qiubai entered the revolutionary base area in Jiangxi, the party sent me to visit Mr. Lu Xun several times. The last time I visited Mr. Lu Xun's home was at the end of 1934. I saw that Mr. Lu Xun was very thin and his mood was very unpleasant. He was usually very sincere and straightforward with people, but that day's conversation was unprecedented. He suddenly became very angry and said, "You don't distinguish between friends and enemies, why attack someone who is attacking the enemy?" I was very surprised, why did he say such words? Mr. Lu Xun was our friend, we respected him, how could we attack him? From my participation in the party's organizational work, I felt that the party's organization was severely damaged, because there were spies inside and outside the party. The situation in the Left League was also very complicated. Therefore, I explained to Mr. Lu Xun, "Precisely because you have a closer political relationship with our party, the enemy hates you extremely, we must prevent the enemy's slander, incitement, and sowing of discord." Although I politically sensed that there were enemies sowing discord between us, I did not participate in the specific work of the Left League and did not know who was spreading rumors? From this struggle, I learned that it was originally the despicable Hu Feng!

In terms of class relations, at that time, Hu Feng was operating under the rule of the Nationalist Party, with relatively favorable conditions; but in the new China after liberation, the landlord class and bureaucratic capitalists have been overthrown, the Chiang Kai-shek gang has been driven out of mainland China, and counter-revolutionary activities have become increasingly difficult. Therefore, the enemy hates the party and the people's democratic government more and more. This is class hatred. In the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, it is thoroughly exposed that this hatred has reached such an extent: "almost hating everyone." This is precisely the last madness of the declining class. This is precisely what the Hu Feng group said: "Let people go mad, and perish in madness." The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has dug its own grave, fallen from the high platform! Although the Hu Feng group has dug its own grave, it will not willingly go into the grave, but will try to crawl out of the grave and hide in every unseen corner, like a gray poisonous snake underground, biting people when they see them. Such poisonous snakes not only exist in cultural organizations but in every organization, and counter-revolutionary activities have also been found in factories, enterprises, and agencies. For this, the union must mobilize male and female workers and their families to search for gray spies in every corner. This is our glorious task. We must actively mobilize and smash them!

**Heighten Vigilance, Fight Against Counter-Revolutionaries**

By Su Buqing

After reading the "People's Daily" published "About the Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group," I felt endless anger. The Communist Party of China has finally liberated us from the dark rule of the Nationalist reactionaries. Today, with one heart and one mind under the correct leadership of the party and the government, we must definitely build our country into a socialist society that eliminates poverty and exploitation. We oppose the American imperialists protecting the traitorous group to occupy our territory of Taiwan. Everyone should unite more closely and strive for the liberation of Taiwan. However, Hu Feng and the members of the Hu Feng group have long been running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek, long-term disguised as revolutionaries, hiding within the people, attempting to overthrow our revolutionary cause. This is an act that the six hundred million people will not allow. We must cleanse Hu Feng and the core members of his group from the people's ranks to ensure the smooth progress of our great socialist construction.

As a mathematician, although I have participated in various great political movements and regular political studies since liberation, my vigilance against counter-revolutionaries is greatly insufficient. In the early stages of this campaign to criticize Hu Feng's reactionary thoughts, I still thought it was within the scope of literary and artistic thoughts and had little to do with mathematics. It was not until my university discovered the Hu Feng group member Jia Zhifang that I was greatly shocked. He disguised himself as a progressive professor and infiltrated our university for three years, constantly spreading poison to the younger generation. Such a counter-revolutionary actually existed in front of us. And I, standing in a responsible position in teaching and administration, not only did not conduct the necessary research and investigation on Jia Zhifang's counter-revolutionary behavior but also, when seeing the second batch of materials published in the "People's Daily," still thought that Jia Zhifang was just a deceived member of the Hu Feng group and did not raise my vigilance against counter-revolutionaries. This is due to my poor foundation in Marxism-Leninism, unable to analyze things. Therefore, I must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism theory, improve my political awareness, correct the incorrect attitudes that high-level intellectuals are prone to, such as complaining, and prevent counter-revolutionaries from having the opportunity to take advantage. We must resolutely fight against class enemies in the period of transition to socialism.

**Severely Punish the Counter-Revolutionary Hu Feng Group**

By Chen Qiyuan, Xiong Jinmei, Yang Sulan, Pu Huaren

We have seen the three batches of materials exposed by the "People's Daily" about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and the editorial on June 10th, and we feel extremely angry. The Hu Feng group is the representative of the most reactionary and treacherous class enemies. They hate and oppose not only the theory of Marxism-Leninism, not only the Communists, party and non-party literary and artistic workers, but also all the people who have stood up under the leadership of the Communist Party. They hate everything in the new China, calling the liberated new society "filthy iron walls." Their sole evil purpose is to infiltrate the Communist Party, agencies, organizations, schools... in the revolutionary ranks to sabotage our socialist construction, dreaming of the restoration of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism on the mainland of China. They want the liberated workers to become slaves of capitalists again; they want the farmers who have obtained good land to sweat for landlords again and not be able to eat their fill; they want intellectuals serving workers, peasants, and soldiers to have no "place to display their talents" again; they want women who have obtained equal rights to lose their freedom to study, work, and marry and live a miserable life again. Since liberation, countless ironclad facts have proven: the political power of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on the worker-peasant alliance is becoming more and more consolidated, economic, national defense, and cultural construction is advancing by leaps and bounds, international status is rising day by day, and the power of the people is limitless. The evil fantasies of the Hu Feng group will undoubtedly not be realized.

We are not literary and artistic workers but supervisory workers in relief agencies. Our colleagues in the relief and welfare sector should actively participate in the struggle against the Hu Feng group, exposing the Hu Feng group members hiding in every corner, and catching them all. At the same time, we should also realize that even if the Hu Feng group is thoroughly eliminated through everyone's efforts, we should not be complacent. The class enemy, the faster they are about to perish, the more they will send more spies and agents of various kinds, using the most shameless and hidden two-faced methods to infiltrate our ranks. In the future, we must sharpen our eyes, heighten our vigilance, and fight a long and arduous battle against all enemies who do not use guns. Most of our staff are good people, but there may be a few bad people infiltrating the revolutionary ranks and causing trouble in secret. If we do not heighten our vigilance, they will spread and grow, showing their fangs and claws, making the hard-earned fruits of labor by the majority of good people suffer undeserved losses. If supervisory personnel are afraid of difficulties and afraid to offend people and do not go deep into the masses to investigate the situation, do not go to production and education departments to check and supervise, and supervisory correspondents do not reflect the situation in a timely manner, then even good cadres may become bad, relaxing or neglecting supervision is like a military unit not posting sentries, not setting up guards, not going on patrols, that is political complacency, giving the class enemy a chance to take advantage, and the Hu Feng group will not be rooted out.

This large-scale settlement of accounts with the Hu Feng group is indeed a big deal, a great struggle that the broad masses enthusiastically support. This is a great victory for us politically. We in the relief and welfare sector, like other sectors, as long as we study well and actively participate in the struggle, our political vigilance will be enhanced. Therefore, we should be full of confidence to study dialectical materialism, eliminate the remnants of subjective idealism, work hard, improve our work, and cleanse all counter-revolutionaries from the revolutionary ranks!

**Not Allowing a Single Hu Feng Member to Escape**

By Huang Ziqing

I am a scientist. In the past, I was not interested in literary works and had never heard of Hu Feng before the exposure of his and his group's counter-revolutionary behavior. After the exposure, I knew that this counter-revolutionary group was hiding in the revolutionary ranks, engaging in conspiratorial sabotage activities. From the third batch of materials published, I knew that they had long been in close contact with the Nationalist Chiang Kai-shek gang, attempting to overthrow our people's government from within, restore the evil rule of the Nationalist gang, and make us return from the bright road of socialism to the dark road of feudalism and colonialism. Regarding this anti-people, counter-revolutionary group, I demand that the people's government thoroughly investigate all their crimes, not allow a single Hu Feng member to escape, and severely punish them according to law.

Talking about this, I have some feelings: in the past society, intellectuals were educated from a young age to "climb up," and such individualism, when developed forward, becomes individual heroism. Because to be an individual hero, one does not hesitate to overthrow those above him. We must overcome individualism because people with individualist thoughts are very easy to be used by counter-revolutionary groups, which is very dangerous. We must get rid of individualism. We must learn Marxism-Leninism and establish a dialectical materialist worldview. The actions of the working class are all for the people, and there is no room here for personal gain and the idealist philosophy of the bourgeoisie. Only by learning Marxism well can we stand firm and not be tempted by the counter-revolutionary group.

**Continue the Struggle, Thoroughly Eliminate Hu Feng Members**

By Yuan Wenshu

What kind of group the Hu Feng group is, now the ironclad facts are clear, and the truth is revealed. The Hu Feng group is a thorough counter-revolutionary conspiratorial group, a spy group. Those "naive" people will have no doubts, and the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng members will have no way to deny it.

This is a great victory we have achieved in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries during the period of transition to a socialist society. However, the battle has not ended.

This counter-revolutionary group has always adopted a two-faced method of activity. Such enemies are more treacherous and vicious than those who openly commit arson and murder. They wear the cloak of Marxism, pretend to be revolutionaries, and deceive us into trusting them. We have been together for a long time without being vigilant. For example, the Hu Feng members in our film department, because they pretended to be progressive, we also believed that they were "progressive writers," and we gave them help and care in every way, working and living with them without noticing.

However, the enemy is hiding in our ranks, always "observing the direction," taking advantage of our loopholes, "penetrating into" our "liver," using the freedom of some people, stealing secrets, listening to intelligence, sowing discord, stirring up trouble; they recruit people, win people over, and carry out "expansion work," strengthening their forces from the literary department to culture, education, party, youth league, trade unions, finance, and the army and other departments. They attack the party and the revolution from all sides, dreaming of the restoration of the reactionary regime of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. The enemy is treacherous and at the same time cunning. Therefore, we must not think that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been exposed now, and everything will be fine, and we can rest assured. No, we must not be complacent, we must learn from this incident, seriously overcome liberalism, and be extremely vigilant!

Only by thoroughly eliminating the Hu Feng members and all counter-revolutionary enemies can we ensure the smooth development of our revolutionary literary and artistic cause and ensure the smooth progress of our country's great socialist construction.

**Do Not Allow Counter-Revolutionaries to Carry Out Sabotage Activities**

By Pang Xunqin

Wolves are fierce, snakes are poisonous. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary gang is even more fierce and poisonous. They disguise themselves as progressives, infiltrate the ranks of revolutionary literary and artistic workers, infiltrate various agencies, and even infiltrate the party. They smile on their faces but use nerve warfare and heart warfare, using tactics of "penetrating into the liver" and Sun Wukong entering the belly, using whips wrapped in rubber to hit prisoners, causing injuries that are not visible on the surface, using tactics of feigning death, setting up decoys, and bundling hand grenades, to carry out anti-party, anti-people, counter-revolutionary conspiracies. They also stipulated the long-term nature of the battle, taking five years as the period, attempting to shake the revolutionary work led by the party for twenty years, the literary front, and the party's literary policy. They have deep hatred for the new society after liberation and the people's revolutionary government, cursing the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people as "withered leaves" and "rotten corpses." They also dream of making the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people led by the party "perish." The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary gang is so fierce and so poisonous. Moreover, they are cunning and hidden.

However, no matter how cunning Hu Feng and his followers are, their ugly true faces will eventually be hidden. Now we have clearly recognized the political background of this batch of counter-revolutionary gang and who their master is. It turns out that Hu Feng has been engaged in anti-communist political work for more than twenty years, and the core members of his group are reactionary officers, imperialist Nationalist spies, revolutionary traitors, and landlord counter-revolutionaries, etc. Therefore, the Hu Feng issue is not just an ideological issue, and the Hu Feng group is not just a sectarian activity issue; it is a thorough counter-revolutionary organization.

Today, we want to tell these counter-revolutionaries: it is you who will perish.

We wholeheartedly enthusiastically support the people's revolutionary government established by the martyrs with their blood. We wholeheartedly enthusiastically support the Communist Party of China. We also wholeheartedly enthusiastically support the literary direction determined by the Communist Party. We will not allow counter-revolutionaries to carry out sabotage activities!

**Smash a Black Gang of the Chiang Kai-shek Traitorous Group**

By Cao Yushan

When I read the materials published by the "People's Daily" about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, the more I read, the more I hated it, and I could not suppress my anger. Hu Feng, this counter-revolutionary who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, has caused incalculable harm to the party and the people's cause in his more than twenty years of counter-revolutionary activities. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group became more rampant in the few years after the national victory, and they had done all their preparations: they had theories, plans, organizations, and programs. The viciousness of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is not inferior to the old butcher of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group slandered the armed forces of the Chinese people's revolution as "bandit armies" and "pus." What is the difference between this and the bloodthirsty Chiang Kai-shek gang? The "About the Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group" has ironclad evidence, Hu Feng is a black gang of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. One in Taiwan, one on the mainland, doing the same tricks.

When our country entered the great socialist revolution and socialist transformation, the Chiang Kai-shek gang and the Hu Feng group, like ants on a hot pan, to save their dying fate, to oppose the socialist revolution, cooperated in front and back to carry out counter-revolutionary tricks. Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, relying on American imperialism, shouted to counterattack the mainland, and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group also made vicious attacks on the party and the people. The crimes of the Hu Feng group have gained the loud applause of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan. After the exposure of Hu Feng's plots, he anxiously encouraged his followers: "Do not be sad, stay calm... In suffering, seek rebirth, everything is for the cause, for a greater future!" Hu Feng's encouragement is not to welcome his master back to the mainland! Is it not to make the traitor Chiang Kai-shek rise from the ashes and return to slaughter the Chinese people! Is it not to turn the free and beautiful China into an American imperialist colony! Is it not that Hu Feng is colluding with Chiang Kai-shek to prepare to overthrow the People's Republic of China with six hundred million people! It is not difficult to understand that this is the essence of Hu Feng's so-called "rebirth," "cause," and "great future." From the "About the Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group," it can be clearly seen: the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng group have a source, and the wood has a root, it is the same as the American-Chiang spy group. No matter how big the ambition of this group of counter-revolutionaries is, how strong their appetite is, how they try to rise from the ashes, how "optimistic" they pretend to be, they are all self-deceiving tricks and cannot save themselves and their master's fate of perishing.

Now, we have exposed the treacherous face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and given it a heavy blow. This is another great victory in our struggle against the enemy during the transitional period. However, we must still be vigilant, sharpen our eyes, heighten our instincts, continue to fight, and double our efforts to pursue the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group continuously, beat them to a pulp, and completely exterminate them.

**Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Activities, Defend the Socialist Construction Cause**

By Liu Jia, Hu Ke, Zhang Zhimin, Xu Guangyao, Gao Yan, and 18 others from the Political Department and Cultural Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing

We are all cultural workers of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing. After reading the "About the Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group," we immediately held a meeting to condemn the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, and all the comrades present expressed extreme anger. The third batch of materials made us further see that the Hu Feng group was originally a group of counter-revolutionary black gangs with close ties to imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang. What made us especially angry was that they infiltrated our revolutionary ranks, infiltrated our party, and hid in our ranks for a long time, using two-faced methods to carry out vicious sabotage of our revolutionary cause. They have deep hatred for the victory of our party and the liberation of the people, slandering our great Communist Party of China as "evil Communists" and slandering our People's Liberation Army as "bandit armies"! But for the counter-revolutionary civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek, they felt "optimistic," and for Chiang Kai-shek's "speeches" "confidence," they felt "inspired." They had close ties with the head of the Nationalist special agents and had close ties with the Nationalist special agency "Central Investigation Bureau," some worked in the "China-American Cooperation Society," and some were Nationalist officers. Who is their master, isn't it clear?

This group of bandits' sabotage of us is meticulously planned and is everywhere. They are the special agent organization of the Chiang Kai-shek gang buried in mainland China. But they are different from ordinary special agents. They wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, use "literature and art" as a cover, infiltrate our ranks, and use various despicable methods to sow discord, disintegrate revolutionary organizations. These plots and schemes are much more sinister than guns and explosives!

The tail of the fox cannot be hidden, and any plots and schemes cannot escape the eyes of the people. Now, the disguises of these bandits have been stripped off, their revolutionary signs have been removed, and these guys have shown their true faces in broad daylight, their faces are so hideous, and their appearances are so ugly! They are loyal slaves of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, they are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people! We believe that only severe suppression can be given to these guys, and there can be no slightest leniency. If we have any illusions about them, that would be too naive.

In the past, due to our low political vigilance, we slept with the "tiger" for a long time and failed to discover it in time. Now, due to the party's wise leadership, we have raised our awareness in this struggle, our minds have become clear, and our eyes have become bright. We must learn from this incident, strengthen our studies, overcome complacency, heighten our vigilance, and fight actively under the party's leadership. We will not rest until we thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group!

**Letter from a Soldier of the People's Liberation Army Public Security Troops:**

I read the third batch of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group with a heart full of indignation and anger. I can no longer remain silent. I must shout out loud: Severely punish Hu Feng! Completely smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group!

The ironclad facts have shown that Hu Feng and the key members of his counter-revolutionary group are not mere literary figures but are indeed die-hard lackeys, spies, and thugs of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. When our country, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, is advancing towards a happy socialist future, these disguised counter-revolutionaries are launching a frenzied attack on our most beloved Party and people, attempting to overthrow our people's democratic dictatorship. Today, the truth is exposed. The ugly faces of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary group are laid bare in broad daylight. We must not show mercy to counter-revolutionaries. Only by resolutely suppressing them can the people live well, and our cause can advance. Therefore, I shout out loud: Severely punish Hu Feng! Completely smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group!

**Letter from Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee and Beijing Municipal Committee:**

We have read the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily" and are filled with great indignation. From these shocking materials, we have come to recognize even more clearly the hideous and vicious true face of this counter-revolutionary group. Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary group have long been loyal lackeys of the Kuomintang, maintaining close ties with the imperialist and Kuomintang spy agencies. They wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism on the outside while engaging in anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary evil deeds behind the scenes. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is the enemy of the people. We are sworn enemies with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and will definitely smash it completely. We demand that the government severely punish the unrepentant members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

In this heart-pounding struggle, it is the great Communist Party of China that has opened our eyes and made us see clearly. In our socialist construction, we must not be complacent for even a moment. We must raise our political consciousness and unite more closely around the Communist Party of China, expose and suppress all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and defend our great cause of socialist construction.

**Letter from Members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, China Democratic League, and the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang:**

After reading the three batches of materials and related documents about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily," we are filled with boundless hatred. The anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary evil activities of the Hu Feng group are absolutely intolerable. We must resolutely drive out this group of insane and harmful enemies from the revolutionary ranks. We suggest that the original election unit immediately revoke Hu Feng's status as a representative of the National People's Congress. We demand that the government thoroughly investigate the members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and punish them according to their crimes. We warn all members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all hidden counter-revolutionaries in the revolutionary ranks to honestly and completely confess their crimes to the people. We, members of various democratic parties, will resolutely continue to participate in the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, assist the government in purging all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and further study Marxism-Leninism, raise class consciousness, heighten vigilance, strictly distinguish between enemies and ourselves, strengthen self-criticism and self-reform, and unite closely around the Communist Party of China. We will fight to completely smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and accelerate the socialist construction of our motherland!

**Letter from Na Hongui of Beijing Geological Institute:**

On the morning of June 10th, I heard from the radio that the "People's Daily" had published the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group." After breakfast, almost every student bought a copy of that day's "People's Daily." As we read, we shouted out our indignation, demanding the severe punishment of Hu Feng! The matter is extremely clear: The core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are a group of the most despicable, most vicious, and most vile enemies. After reading these materials, we have a deeper and more concrete understanding of the sharpness and complexity of class struggle in the transitional period. The Hu Feng incident is a major political lesson for us young people, which we will never forget.

As pointed out in the editorial of the "People's Daily": "If the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group can infiltrate our ranks, even infiltrate the ranks of the Communist Party, why can't other counter-revolutionaries use similar two-faced tactics to hide in our government agencies, troops, schools, factories, people's organizations, and democratic parties? It must be said that they will definitely infiltrate, and there is already evidence that they have infiltrated many places."

In the past, some students thought that class struggle was not sharp in schools, but this "naive" (or rather, complacent) view has been refuted by facts. The core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, such as the traitorous Kuomintang officer Aleng, did not engage in counter-revolutionary activities and poison the minds of the youth in Nankai University? It seems that this "naivety" is how dangerous it is! We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance and make sure that all evil plots of the bad elements cannot succeed, thus defending our socialist construction!

**Letter from All Teachers and Staff of Beijing West Fourth District Workers' Evening School:**

The three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily" fully prove that the Hu Feng group is an extremely reactionary spy group. They cunningly use two-faced tactics, wearing the cloak of Marxism, pretending to be revolutionary, and engaging in anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary deeds. Their so-called literary activities are just a cover. Their real profession is spies. After reading these three batches of materials, we are extremely angry. We demand the severe suppression of Hu Feng and Aleng and other ringleaders, and the thorough investigation of other members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

**Letter from Chen Desen of the Fuel Industry Department Water Power Guest House:**

I am a material and technical supply worker. After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the Party newspaper, I am filled with even more boundless hatred. From the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group that have been published, it is clear that the Hu Feng group is a thorough counter-revolutionary conspiracy organization. If before the publication of these three batches of materials, I thought that the criticism of Hu Feng's subjective idealist philosophy was a literary thought problem and had not recognized the seriousness of this struggle, then now I should thank the Party for opening my eyes, making me recognize the reactionary face of Hu Feng and the Hu Feng group, and this struggle is a serious class struggle.

For more than twenty years, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been wearing the cloak of Marxism, using "literary workers" as a cover, and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. They fantasize about "cleansing" the people's armed forces, hate the victory of the people's revolution, and hope that the people's government will "perish." They almost hate everyone. They know that to make Chiang Kai-shek able to restore power in China, they must first start by destroying the Party. Therefore, they launch a frenzied attack on the Party and have "written three reports with the greatest sincerity, each more detailed and honest than the last" and "penetrated" into our "liver" to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. However, they may never understand that this is just a dream. Truth is truth, and truth will always triumph. We have a solid people's democratic dictatorship, the support of millions of awakened masses from the bottom up, the strong leadership of the Party, and the wise policies of the Party. No matter how cunning the counter-revolutionary group is, no matter how they disguise themselves, they will eventually show their tails. I firmly demand the thorough investigation of the crimes of the Hu Feng group and the severe suppression of them.

Through the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident, I have come to recognize even more the complexity and sharpness of class struggle in the transitional period. The enemy's sabotage activities are cunning and omnipresent. Therefore, we must learn from this incident, strive to study Marxism, heighten class vigilance and political sensitivity, and resolutely fight against all counter-revolutionaries to the end, purging the counter-revolutionaries.

**Letter from Yang Peiyi of Shenyang Paint Factory:**

I am an employee of a factory. After the "People's Daily" published the two batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, although I had already recognized that the Hu Feng group is an anti-Party, anti-people counter-revolutionary group, I did not realize that the backers of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group were the enemies of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek. After reading the third batch of materials, I further recognized that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a counter-revolutionary organization controlled by Kuomintang spies, and Hu Feng and others are long-term spies hiding in the revolutionary ranks.

As a member of the working class, I have received a profound education from this major political struggle. Due to my complacency, I did not fully understand the seriousness of this political struggle at the beginning. In the future, I will definitely strengthen my ideological training and heighten my political sensitivity to be able to correctly distinguish right from wrong and recognize the disguised enemies. At the same time, to defend our socialist construction, I demand that the government, according to the law, severely suppress Hu Feng and other counter-revolutionaries.

**Letter from Zhou Zun of Shenyang Battery Factory:**

After reading the several batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily," we are extremely indignant. At the same time, we feel that in the revolutionary victory today, class struggle is even more acute, and counter-revolutionaries will use every means to sabotage the revolutionary cause. We must heighten our political vigilance a hundredfold.

The evil activities of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary group are extremely vicious, cunning, and utterly shameful. From the materials that have been exposed, it can be seen that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group not only has its own counter-revolutionary program but also has a strict organization. They have recruited Kuomintang reactionary officers, American-Kuomintang spies, and feudal landlord counter-revolutionaries. From the north of the motherland to Guangdong, from government agencies to people's organizations, from factories and mines to troops and schools, and even to our Party, they have established "bases" everywhere, secretly communicated, and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities.

I am a worker in a factory and mine enterprise. In the past, due to low political vigilance, I was not very concerned about this matter. Recently, from the exposure of these several batches of materials, I have seen the evil of the Hu Feng group, and I demand that the government quickly bring Hu Feng to justice.

**Letter from Xiangguo of Shandong Fangzi Coal Mine:**

I am a coal mine worker. After reading the "People's Daily" published Hu Feng's false confession and the first and second batches of materials about the Hu Feng reactionary group, I was already extremely angry, but when I read the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group word by word, it made me gnash my teeth and fill my chest with anger, and I could no longer suppress my indignation. I demand the punishment of Hu Feng. From the exposure of the third batch of materials, it is even more blatant and thorough in proving that the Hu Feng group is a complete counter-revolutionary group. Hu Feng and the core members of his group have long been loyal lackeys of the Chiang bandits and have maintained close ties with the Chiang bandits' spy agencies. However, they disguised themselves as revolutionaries, hiding in our revolutionary ranks, using vicious two-faced tactics to engage in despicable counter-revolutionary activities, attempting to overthrow the people's government. They curse our people's revolutionary government to "perish," and they see our people's revolutionary forces as "pus" that needs to be "drained out." They try every means to infiltrate the Party, steal Party documents, and engage in counter-revolutionary activities in collaboration with external forces. Hu Feng group member Zhang Zhongxiao said: "I almost hate everyone, ... I hate this social order." Especially Hu Feng and the core members of his group, Aleng and Lü Yuan, they are all counter-revolutionaries with blood on their hands. This cunning counter-revolutionary group, although their methods are clever, has finally revealed their evil nature.

We must completely eliminate this group that harms the people, root them out, and make sure they never sprout again.

---

**Letter from Liu Gang of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles Research Department Archives Room:**

The "People's Daily" has exposed another batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. The thugs in the Hu Feng group are now very clear. This counter-revolutionary group includes various counter-revolutionaries and is an extremely cunning and vicious counter-revolutionary group. Traitors, Central Intelligence Agency spies, reactionary officers, and landlords are the core of this counter-revolutionary group.

These thugs, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, colluded with Japanese imperialism and slaughtered countless fathers, brothers, wives, and children. Until now, the faces of those killed relatives are deeply engraved in our hearts. During the counter-encirclement campaigns, they used various vile methods to slaughter our relatives. Until now, we still shudder at the thought. In our hometown of a hundred households, there were more than twenty households where the entire family was buried alive, burned to death, and slaughtered. Now, every time I think of my little sister, who was not yet two years old, being grabbed by both legs and chopped to death by them, I get goosebumps all over my body.

After liberation, those who shared the fate of these butchers, they used various despicable tricks to hide in our ranks, attempting to overthrow our government and let their masters, imperialism, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government, restore power.

Their counter-revolutionary countless evil deeds, can we tolerate? No! We want to live a happy life, we cannot tolerate these evil thugs. We must thoroughly investigate the unexposed reactionaries, arrest the reactionaries who refuse to confess to the people. And we demand that the government severely punish the unrepentant ringleaders of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, Hu Feng, Aleng, and others, and avenge our blood!

---

**Letter from Tong Naolin of Shenyang Liaoning People's Publishing House:**

After reading the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, I am more and more angry. The mask of the Hu Feng group has been torn off, revealing their vicious, cunning, and evil counter-revolutionary group's ugly face. We have seen clearly why the Hu Feng group has been so hostile to us, cursing us, slandering us, attacking us for twenty years. This is the nature of Hu Feng and his masters, imperialism, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. They are unwilling to accept the victory of the people's government. To achieve their goal of restoration, they have used every despicable means. They are omnipresent. Today, under the correct leadership of the Party, the plots of the Hu Feng group have been exposed, and now is the time to settle their accounts thoroughly. I firmly demand that Hu Feng and the members of the Hu Feng group be punished according to the law immediately.

From the Hu Feng incident, we have also learned a lesson. We must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, overcome bourgeois individualism and complacency, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, and prevent counter-revolutionaries from taking advantage of any loopholes. Completely smash the enemy's plots to ensure the smooth progress of our socialist construction.

---

**Letter from Zhao Yifu, Shi Qirong, and Zhu Jiujiang of the State Construction Commission of the People's Republic of China:**

After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we feel even more indignant about the anti-people and counter-revolutionary evil activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. The mask of the Hu Feng group has been completely torn off, and their true face has been exposed. Hu Feng and his group are counter-revolutionaries closely linked with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. They are our people's enemies and the most vicious, ferocious, and terrifying enemies. We must smash the Hu Feng group and expel these counter-revolutionaries from the people's ranks.

We cannot be indifferent to this batch of evil counter-revolutionaries and their evil activities. We must actively participate in the struggle against the Hu Feng group and expose all hidden members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. We demand that the government punish them according to the law.

---

**Letter from All Staff of the Central Institute for the Control of Biological Products:**

The anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary evil activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group have aroused the extreme indignation of all our staff. They dare to use the cunning and vicious tactics of two-faced people, pretending to be revolutionary, and secretly engaging in vicious counter-revolutionary activities. They have a program and plan to launch a frenzied attack on our Party, attempting to undermine the foundation of our revolutionary government to achieve their so-called "greater future." They attempt to make their masters, the enemies of the people, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary forces, restore power in China.

We will not allow them to continue their plots and endanger our national socialist construction. All our staff firmly demand the thorough smashing of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and the complete elimination of these bad guys. They must be punished according to the law.

---

**Letter from All Staff of the People's Insurance Company of China:**

With extreme indignation, we read the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. This batch of materials has exposed the Hu Feng group as a counter-revolutionary group using "literature" as a cover. Ironclad facts have proven that the Hu Feng group is closely linked with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. American imperialists, Kuomintang spies, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and turncoats are the core members of this group. We must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate these counter-revolutionary groups.

Our country is advancing rapidly along the socialist path, and therefore, class struggle is becoming more complex and acute. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has once again proven that the already defeated and soon-to-be eliminated exploiting classes will not die in peace. They will use every means to sabotage our socialist cause. We must learn deeply from the Hu Feng incident, heighten our political vigilance, and improve our ability to identify counter-revolutionaries. We firmly believe that as long as the people of the whole country unite closely around the Communist Party of China, maintain a high degree of political vigilance, we can expose all hidden counter-revolutionaries and ensure the smooth progress of our great socialist construction. We firmly demand the thorough smashing of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and the deepening of this struggle to every corner, expelling all hidden counter-revolutionaries from our revolutionary ranks. They must be punished according to the law.

---

**Letter from All Teachers and Staff of Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing School:**

The counter-revolutionary face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been completely exposed. Hu Feng himself has long been closely linked with the Kuomintang bandits' spy chiefs. The core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, Aleng, were once military instructors of the Chiang bandits, Lü Yuan was a spy of the "China-U.S. Cooperation Society" ... In short, they are loyal lackeys of imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, and they are the mortal enemies of our broad masses of people!

There is no need to quote their vicious counter-revolutionary nonsense specifically. We can no longer suppress our anger. We demand that the government resolutely and thoroughly suppress these counter-revolutionaries. For the die-hard core members of the Hu Feng group, they must be given the strictest punishment!

---

**Letter from Teachers Wang Lanhui, Shen Zhong, and Xu Wenhua of Beijing Haidian District First Central Primary School:**

The "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, making us realize that the Hu Feng group is the lackeys of imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. We demand the immediate arrest of Hu Feng and his punishment according to the law, and the thorough investigation of the members of the Hu Feng group, dealing with them appropriately, and completely purging this counter-revolutionary group.

We are primary school educators. From the Hu Feng incident, we have realized the sharpness and complexity of class struggle in the transitional period. In the future, we will strive to study political theory, raise political consciousness, strengthen criticism and self-criticism, strengthen unity, and contribute more to the socialist construction.

**Letter from Navy Soldier Zhou Quan:**

After reading the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we have seen clearly the deeds of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group for more than twenty years. This group of loyal lackeys of Chiang Kai-shek has always used the cover of revolution to secretly launch vicious attacks on the revolution. However, the fantasies of counter-revolutionaries will not come true. In the face of the revolutionary people, they have finally revealed their true colors. I am a soldier of the people's navy. The evil deeds of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group have aroused my extreme indignation. I demand that the people's government give these evil elements the strictest punishment. Today, we, the people's navy, together with our brother units, are diligently carrying out the glorious mission entrusted to us by the people of the motherland, defending our coastal defenses. While the Hu Feng group is trying to sabotage our revolutionary cause from all sides, they have infiltrated our government agencies, educational institutions, cultural publishing institutions, ... and even our troops. They have even infiltrated our Party. How cunning the enemy is! We still cannot heighten our vigilance? We must resolutely eliminate them. No matter how cunning and vicious they are, no matter how hard they try, using what "strategies," they cannot escape the grasp of the people.

**Letter from Teachers Gao Hui and Shen Weitong of the Analytical Chemistry Teaching and Research Group of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Industry:**

After reading the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group" published in the "People's Daily," we have seen more clearly the political face of the Hu Feng group. This batch of materials fully proves that the core members of the Hu Feng group are counter-revolutionaries closely linked with imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. Originally, these masked robbers were long-time loyal lackeys of Chiang Kai-shek, but they disguised themselves as revolutionaries, hiding in the revolutionary ranks for a long time, infiltrating the Party organization, stealing Party secret documents, and engaging in various counter-revolutionary deeds. Their methods are so despicable, vicious, cunning, and ugly. Now, the masks of these robbers have been torn off, and their counter-revolutionary faces have been completely exposed.

The counter-revolutionary members of the Hu Feng group have been crazily hating the victory of the people's revolution. They see the revolutionary forces led by the Communist Party as "withered leaves" and "decaying corpses." They fantasize about the people's government "perishing." Little do they know that they themselves and the class they support are the "decaying corpses." They are the ghosts of the already dead Chiang bandit regime. They cannot see the power of the people. The ones that will truly "perish" are themselves. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people will stand forever.

To defend the victory of our people's revolution, consolidate the people's democratic government, defend the socialist construction of the motherland, and purify the revolutionary ranks, we request that the government resolutely suppress the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group according to the law, and strictly investigate the still-hidden Hu Feng members. Not a single one must be allowed to escape.

From the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident, we have received a profound lesson. Those comrades with a single technical outlook think that they are engaged in scientific work and only need to do more research and experiments. Therefore, they are not concerned about politics, and their political sense is very dull. They even naively think that after the thunderous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, there will be no more counter-revolutionaries. Even for the Hu Feng incident, they were not concerned at the beginning and thought it was just a thought problem. It was not until the "People's Daily" published the second and third batches of materials related to the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group that everyone became alert and unanimously recognized that if we do not study politics well and raise our class vigilance, we will become the targets of these counter-revolutionaries, which is very dangerous. In the future, we must strive to study politics, raise our political sense, and never allow counter-revolutionaries to find any loopholes. Only in this way can we ensure that scientific work serves the socialist cause.

**Letter from Yang Shusheng of Tangshan Health and Epidemic Prevention Station:**

For twenty years, Hu Feng has been steadfastly engaged in counter-revolutionary evil activities and is our people's enemy. The struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a political struggle of national significance.

Hu Feng and many of the core members of his group have long been loyal lackeys of the Kuomintang, maintaining close ties with American imperialism and Kuomintang spy agencies, disguising themselves as revolutionaries, hiding in the people, and engaging in counter-revolutionary deeds. One of the core members of the Hu Feng group, Aleng, is a Kuomintang officer. He sees the people's revolutionary forces as "pus" that "must be drained out" and believes that the attack on the people's revolutionary forces must be thorough and decisive, "not doing it at all or doing it completely!" The Hu Feng group has shown extreme hatred towards the new society and the people's revolutionary government after liberation. They say, "I hate this social order." They curse the "perishing" and "collapse" of the people's revolutionary government. The members of the Hu Feng group, in their secret letters, slander the people's support for the Communist Party and the Party's leadership as "worshipping idols," and slander our revolution as "withered leaves" and "decaying corpses," etc.

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is the enemy of our people. We must completely eliminate this counter-revolutionary group. We have exposed the plots of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and given these counter-revolutionaries a heavy blow. This is the victory of the Party and the victory of the people of the whole country. We must consolidate the victory and fight to the end. We must resolutely suppress the Hu Feng group and completely smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. We must learn from this lesson, strive to study Marxism-Leninism, always heighten our vigilance, and completely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary saboteurs in the revolutionary ranks.

**Letter from All Teachers and Staff of the Department of Western Languages, Peking University:**

We, all the teachers and staff of the Department of Western Languages, Peking University, are extremely indignant about the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. From the third batch of materials published in the "People's Daily," we have a clearer understanding that the Hu Feng group is not just a reactionary literary group but a political group with organization and planning that is anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary. The core members of this group are the filth of old China, closely linked with domestic and foreign class enemies. For many years, they have been using vicious, shameless political two-faced tactics, hiding in the revolutionary ranks, faithfully serving imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. They are omnipresent and seize every opportunity. Their evil and arrogant ambitions are to overthrow the people's socialist construction and attempt to restore the dark rule of the reactionaries. In a word, they are the most dangerous enemies of all the people of China. We must not allow their plots to succeed. We must resolutely and thoroughly smash this reactionary group.

Therefore, we demand that the government resolutely suppress this group of counter-revolutionaries; we also demand that those who have not yet removed their masks, the Hu Feng group members, be warned: Do not try to sneak through. You must confess the truth.

In this struggle, we deeply feel that we must intensify our systematic and regular study of Marxism-Leninism because only by mastering the correct standpoint, viewpoint, and method can we discern the disguised reactionary thoughts; we also deeply feel that we must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a thousand times, be good at identifying various counter-revolutionaries, expose them, and eliminate them; at the same time, we must strive to overcome all shortcomings in our work and thoughts, block any loopholes that the enemy might exploit. Only in this way can we guarantee the fruits of the people's revolution and ensure the victory of socialist construction.

**Letter from the Communication Group of Shanxi Provincial Monopoly Company:**

We are state-owned commercial workers. In the past, we knew little about the affairs of the literary circle, especially about Hu Feng. When we saw the three batches of materials published by the "People's Daily" exposing the crimes of the Hu Feng group, we were filled with boundless indignation. Hu Feng was originally a wolf in sheep's clothing, infiltrating our revolutionary ranks and engaging in anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary evil activities. The employees of our company, through discussions, unanimously recognized that the Hu Feng reactionary group is a group of the most cunning class enemies. Originally, they had infiltrated into our "liver" to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. In the past, some comrades thought that Hu Feng only had errors in literary thought and had little to do with us. Now, after seeing these materials, we are greatly shocked. We were too complacent in the past.

Recently, the third batch of materials published in the newspapers has completely clarified the political background of the Hu Feng reactionary group. Originally, their master was Chiang Kai-shek. Hu Feng and many of the core members of the Hu Feng group have long been loyal lackeys of the Kuomintang, and their goal is to overthrow our people's democratic government and restore the reactionary government.

We deeply feel that we must heighten our class vigilance and political sensitivity and can no longer be complacent. We demand the immediate arrest and trial of the ringleaders of the Hu Feng reactionary group. And thoroughly eliminate the hidden counter-revolutionaries in every corner.

**Letter from Soldier Xie Fusheng of the People's Liberation Army:**

With boundless hatred, I read the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. The thoroughly counter-revolutionary group has revealed its true colors. Originally, the core members of the Hu Feng group were long-time loyal lackeys of Chiang Kai-shek, maintaining close ties with imperialist spy agencies, disguising themselves as revolutionaries, hiding in the people, and engaging in counter-revolutionary deeds. This is how cunning, vicious, and treacherous these counter-revolutionaries are!

For more than twenty years, they have been hiding in the people, engaging in counter-revolutionary and anti-people deeds. They hate the people's revolutionary forces, cursing the Communist Party and the people's revolutionary forces as "evil communists," cursing the people's revolutionary government to "perish" and "collapse," and being greatly "inspired" by the "instructions" of the Chiang bandits, believing that the "main force" of the People's Liberation Army can be "broken in three months" and "cleared in one year"; seeing the people's revolutionary forces as "pus" that "must be drained out." Originally, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was in cahoots with the Kuomintang, imperialist elements, breathing through the same nostrils, wearing the same pants, walking the same path, and engaging in the same counter-revolutionary deeds.

As a member of the People's Liberation Army, to defend the safety of the motherland and the socialist construction, to defend the victory of the people's revolutionary struggle, and to consolidate the people's democratic government, I must always hold my gun tightly and heighten my vigilance a hundredfold; at the same time, strengthen political study, raise my political sensitivity, and resolutely and thoroughly smash the enemies who sabotage socialist construction!

We know that the enemy will not die in peace and will not allow us to peacefully carry out socialist construction. This heart-pounding struggle is our experience and lesson. But no matter how cunning the enemy's plots are, no matter how cleverly they disguise themselves, as long as we heighten our vigilance, no enemy can escape the net of the people.

We must eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries in the people! We must completely eliminate them! We will not stop until we achieve complete victory!

**Letter from Ouyang Zhida, Xiao Chuanqiu, and Zhang Songhe of the Memorial Hall of the People's Heroes Design Office:**

After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we have seen more clearly their counter-revolutionary evil activities and their hideous faces. Hu Feng has long been engaged in political work in the "anti-communist" army in Jiangxi. Aleng was a Kuomintang officer, and Lü Yuan once worked in the "China-U.S. Cooperation Society." Originally, the Hu Feng group, which used the cover of literary workers, was composed of these criminals with heinous crimes. We are horrified after reading these materials. The materials prove: The core members of the Hu Feng group have long participated in the anti-people civil war, maintaining close ties with American imperialism and Kuomintang spy agencies. They are loyal lackeys of Chiang Kai-shek and share the fate of the Chiang bandits. After national liberation, the Hu Feng group has shown extreme hatred and fear towards the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, secretly organizing, planning, and launching frenzied attacks on the Party and the people.

The Hu Feng group, this group of enemies hiding in the revolutionary ranks, is cunning, treacherous, and vicious, and therefore, the harm to the revolutionary cause is serious. As construction workers and art workers participating in the construction of the Memorial Hall of the People's Heroes, we are extremely indignant about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. We deeply feel that the cause of the Chinese people's revolution is arduous. The victory fruits won by countless heroes and martyrs with their blood are sacred and inviolable. While the plots of the Hu Feng group are attempting to sabotage and overthrow our people's democratic government, making the Chiang bandits restore power.

The Hu Feng group has long been spreading reactionary thoughts in the cultural circle and shamelessly distorting the Party's literary policies. Bourgeois idealism and individualism have a foundation in the construction and art circles, so we construction workers and art workers must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, strive for ideological reform, and clean up the influence of Hu Feng's thoughts from the ideological level.

We must learn from the Hu Feng incident, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, and we demand that the government arrest Hu Feng and the ringleaders of his group according to the law, and thoroughly purge his counter-revolutionary group. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

**Letter from Liu Xingguo of Beijing Railway Administration Fengtai Construction Section:**

I read the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily" and have a clearer understanding of the extreme reactionary nature of the Hu Feng group and its political background.

I am a railway worker. At first, when I saw the articles criticizing Hu Feng's reactionary thoughts, I only thought it was a matter of literary thought rectification. The publication of the first, second, and third batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has awakened us. We can no longer tolerate these counter-revolutionaries hiding in our revolutionary ranks. We must learn from this lesson, strengthen the study of political theory, heighten our revolutionary vigilance, and fight to thoroughly smash all counter-revolutionary plots.

**Letter from Du Zhiyu, Yang Guozhen, Qiu Wenjuan, and Guo Weidong of the Accounting Department of the People's Bank of China:**

We are young workers in the bank. After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we clearly see their blood-stained hands and hideous faces, recognizing that they are loyal lackeys of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been hiding in the people, engaging in extremely evil counter-revolutionary deeds. The Hu Feng group is a group of crazy and vicious counter-revolutionary criminals!

We have no reason to remain silent. The class enemies will not be content with our victory. We must uproot the old roots of these insane, hidden counter-revolutionary bandits in the revolution.

We can no longer bear it. We must catch this handful of inhuman spies in one net. We firmly demand: Punish Hu Feng and the ringleaders of the Hu Feng group according to the law. We must also heighten our revolutionary vigilance and resolutely smash all plots of the counter-revolutionary enemies.

**Letter from Tu Yishao, a student majoring in Automobiles at the Power Machinery Department of Tsinghua University:**

I am a student from a working-class background. After reading the three batches of materials exposing the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng and his group published in the "People's Daily," I am filled with boundless indignation. Our Party is glorious, correct, and great. We love the Party, believe in the Party, and respect the Party more than our own parents. Only under the correct leadership of the Party can we build a socialist society, and the laboring masses can finally achieve complete liberation.

However, the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng and his group, who are hiding in our ranks, are launching a vicious attack on the Party and the revolution in an organized and step-by-step manner. They have a reactionary political program and counter-revolutionary organizational discipline. They have long been using various cunning and vicious tactics to sabotage our revolutionary cause. They are even more vicious in using the so-called "Sun Wukong entering the belly" tactic to send their henchmen into our revolutionary ranks and Party organizations, aiming to launch a two-pronged attack on the Party and the revolution.

The counter-revolutionary plots of Hu Feng and his group are in line with the American-Kuomintang bandits. The third batch of materials also exposed that they have long been in close contact with the Kuomintang spy agencies, which is no wonder they have shown strong hatred and fear towards the victory of the people's revolution, which is no wonder they want to use every means to sabotage the Party, which enjoys unlimited prestige among the people.

Now, the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng and his group are like a poisonous snake, exposed nakedly in front of us. The poisonous snake must be eliminated. The revolutionary victory fruits won with blood must not be allowed to be sabotaged. The counter-revolutionary Hu Feng and his group must be severely punished by the people's law.

The exposure of the counter-revolutionary plots of Hu Feng and his group has made me deeply understand the correctness of Marxism-Leninism's theory of class struggle: When our strength becomes stronger, our enemies will not fade away, but they will hate us even more, and their resistance will become even more frenzied, and therefore, the struggle between us and the enemy will become even more acute and complex. Therefore, we must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strive to study Marxism-Leninism, raise our political and ideological level, raise our class consciousness, and fight for the people, for the motherland, and for the great cause of the Party for life.

**Letter from All Ethnic Minority Workers of the Nationalities Publishing House:**

On June 10th, our Nationalities Publishing House held a meeting of all employees to denounce the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. At the meeting, more than twenty officials from the Han, Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, Korean, and Xibe ethnic groups spoke, unanimously expressing their great indignation in various ethnic languages and denouncing the counter-revolutionary crimes of Hu Feng and the Hu Feng group. We all agree that the plots of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are to sabotage our free and equal ethnic family. We love our motherland and love the common cause of all ethnic groups—the socialist cause; while Hu Feng dreams of the restoration of the American-Kuomintang reactionary forces, wanting to make us ethnic groups suffer again, which is something we ethnic groups will never allow. The third batch of materials has further proven that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a group of counter-revolutionaries closely linked with American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. We must completely smash the Hu Feng group and expel these counter-revolutionaries from the people's ranks. At the same time, we must also firmly and thoroughly purge all hidden counter-revolutionaries similar to the Hu Feng group. Hu Feng and his group are more poisonous than snakes and more ferocious than wolves. Forgiving them is a crime. We must learn from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident, heighten our vigilance, strengthen our unity, study Marxism-Leninism, and better serve the people. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a great victory in the revolutionary cause of all ethnic groups. We demand the thorough investigation of the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and the punishment of Hu Feng and the members of the Hu Feng group according to the law.

**Letter from All Teachers and Staff of the Central Institute for Nationalities:**

After seeing the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group" published in the "People's Daily," we feel even more indignant and hateful towards Hu Feng and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group!

Now, with irrefutable evidence, it has been proven that Hu Feng and the core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are long-term spies hiding in our revolutionary ranks and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities.

They have long been in contact with American imperialism and Kuomintang spy agencies, faithfully serving American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits for a long time, cunningly and viciously sabotaging our revolutionary cause. They dream of the restoration of the Kuomintang bandits' reactionary forces in China. They are the enemies of all ethnic groups in the country.

We suggest that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress immediately revoke Hu Feng's status as a representative of the National People's Congress according to the law. We demand that the government severely punish Hu Feng and the ringleaders of his group. We must resolutely purge all counter-revolutionaries to consolidate our people's democratic government.

All ethnic groups in the country must learn a serious lesson from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incident, heighten political vigilance, expose the enemy's counter-revolutionary plots, and fight them resolutely, unite closely around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and strive for the construction of our great socialist motherland!

**Letter from Yang Yankai of the Cultural Center of Binchuan County, Yunnan Province (Yi Ethnic Group):**

The true face of the long-disguised counter-revolutionary Hu Feng has been exposed, which is a glorious victory in the socialist construction of our motherland.

As a small soldier on the cultural front—a cultural center employee—I cannot help but put forward my request. I advocate revoking Hu Feng's status as a representative of the National People's Congress and punishing him according to the law.

**Letter from Su Yongqin, a student of the Zhuang ethnic group at Beijing Russian Language Institute:**

I am a student from an ethnic minority. Recently, the "People's Daily" published the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. Every time I get the newspaper, I read it all at once, and each time I am more and more unable to suppress my anger.

The core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, composed of American-Kuomintang spies, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and turncoats, have finally been exposed, making people of all ethnic groups recognize the ferocious and hideous face of this counter-revolutionary group, which is a heartening thing and a victory for the revolutionary cause.

This counter-revolutionary group has always used the tactics of two-faced people, using "literature" as a cover, engaging in anti-Communist Party and anti-people's revolutionary activities. Because they are very cunning and good at disguising themselves, they have learned "dark wisdom" and studied "a few days of Marxism-Leninism" to oppose Marxism-Leninism, so they can deceive many people for a long time. They try every means to infiltrate the Communist Party, steal documents, act as spies, and they also want to sabotage our Party from within. But as long as we heighten our vigilance, the enemy's plots will not succeed and will eventually be exposed.

Being lenient to counter-revolutionaries is being cruel to the people. Suppressing counter-revolutionaries must be ruthless, "not doing it at all or doing it completely." I demand the severe punishment of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and will not allow counter-revolutionaries to "slip through" again.

    坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
    胡风反革命集团的罪恶事件给予我们的教训
    章乃器
    经过了三批材料的发表，胡风反革命集团的狰狞面目，已经暴露得很多了。揭发还在继续。从已经发表的材料来衡量，完全可以断定，这是一件猖狂透顶的反党、反人民、反革命事件，而绝不仅仅是思想问题。这是一件全国人民都应该深切注意的大事情，而绝不仅仅是文艺界的事情。任何有良心、有血性的人，读了这三批材料，都会对这一伙豺狼燃起了心头的怒火。任何爱祖国、爱人民、爱我们的社会主义事业的人，读了这三批材料，都会擦亮自己的眼睛，敏锐自己的政治嗅觉，提高自己的政治责任感和警惕性，从而会更加善于分清敌我友，更加憎恨人民的敌人，同时也更加热爱自己的人民和朋友。
    胡风和他的骨干分子不是别的，正是一伙一贯反党、反人民的反革命分子。胡风集团所仇视的并不仅仅是少数的党的文艺工作领导者，而是所有党内党外的进步文艺作家。他们不仅仅反对我们的文艺运动，而且痛恨整个的革命胜利，痛恨以毛主席为首的全国人民。他们还用极其卑鄙阴险的手段，打入党的组织，打入国家机关，打入民主党派和人民团体，尽量分布爪牙到各大中小城市，真是无隙不钻，无孔不入。倘使胡风集团的阴谋得逞，那，中国人民还有命吗？
    中国共产党七届四中全会指示我们：把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，这是一个比反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命更深刻更广泛的革命，它包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。极复杂极尖锐的斗争的内容，许多人是体会不够的。胡风集团的反革命事实，对于我们大家是一个痛切的教训。在我们的力量更加强大，我们的事业更加胜利的时候，敌人不仅更加毒恨，也更加恐惧。“处身危、虑患深”，这是一句符合客观规律的名言。敌人的破坏行动不仅是更加隐蔽，而且由于“虑患深”而更加“高明”了。他们以破坏为专业，有的是时间，阴谋诡计真是可以层出不穷的。只要我们稍微有一点点的自满，在一点点的自满当中泛起了一点点的疏忽大意，自以为“处身不危”就可以“虑患不深”了，那么，敌人的阴谋诡计就可能乘虚而入。我们只有经常保持头脑清醒，遇事开动脑筋，习于深思远虑，才能周密无懈地杜塞一切漏洞，使敌人无隙可钻、无孔可入。然而，更重要的还是更加密切地联系群众，不断地提高群众的政治嗅觉，经常教育广大群众善于识别人民的形象和敌人的形象，识别人民的性格和敌人的性格，从四面八方警惕着敌人可能进行的破坏活动，这才是保卫我们国家的最可靠的办法。
    人民的眼睛是雪亮的，还有人能怀疑吗？胡风集团反革命事实的继续揭发，难道不是一个活生生的例子吗？在今天，任何的隐蔽行为都是瞒不到底的。显然，反革命活动还在各个方面进行着，反革命分子还在每一个角落里躲藏着。胡风集团案件的揭发，应该可以惊醒这些人，让他们考虑一下，还是继续躲藏下去，让雪亮的人民眼睛发现出来好呢，还是自动坦白好呢。我想，他们只要了解到我们一贯的“坦白从宽”的原则，再想到瞒是终久瞒不了的，就会觉得还是自动坦白的好。我们坚决提倡忠诚老实的作风，反对虚伪奸诈的两面派，这是根据唯物主义的精神的，是不可动摇的。
    思想问题同政治问题是有严格的区别的，在我们的国家里，是没有什么“思想犯”的。但，作为
  一个要把自己改造成为社会主义公民的人，却应该把胡风集团的事件当作自己的“当头棒喝”。检查
  一下，有没有曾经在内心的深处对胡风的一伙引起
  一些同情呢？倘使过去有过，现在还有没有呢。我想，工商界当中，难免还有一些口头拥护过渡时期总任务，内心怀疑甚至反对社会主义改造的人。更有不少认为走社会主义的路是“不得不然”，而还没有认为是“理所当然”的、勉强“随大流”的人。前一种人也是“两面派”的一种，肯定是会对胡风的一伙默默同情的，甚至会对自己的“亲信”表示这种同情的；后一种人或者要认为“事不关己，高高挂起”，或者也可能默默同情其中的某些部分。应该不应该同情？是不是“事不关己”？这就很值得检查了。另外有一种人，自命对革命有功，想在革命胜利之后在人民的头上捞一把，结果捞不到，或者捞得不够；还有一种人，自命本领非凡，现在是“大材小用”，或者“投闲置散”了。这两种人并不限于工商界，还有知识分子；他们的共同之点是苦闷牢骚，不满现状——不是为着关切人民事业而不满现状，而只是为着自己的利益。这种人就很值得警惕了！他们正是胡风集团所要笼络、争取的对象。
    人民之间的团结必须积极扩大和巩固。只有在扩大、巩固团结的基础上，才能把少数的敌人孤立起来，才有利于用千万双人民的眼睛敏锐地警惕着敌人的每一行动。不是浮泛的、没有根据的、客气敷衍的、表面的团结，而必须逐步做到以通过具体分析、深入地相互了解的真诚热爱的团结。由于广大人民都已经在各种形式之下组织起来了，我们今天是有条件这样做的。要对付日益“高明”的敌人的阴谋诡计，我们也必须这样做。粗放的做法是不适合今天的时代了。我们必须团结得像铜墙铁壁一样的坚强，使敌人望而却步。
    彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团的胜利是肯定的了。让我们在这一伟大的胜利基础上，更紧密地接受中国共产党的领导，为进一步肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子而共同奋斗！
    一定要彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    吴晗
    我连续读了胡风反革命集团第一、二、三批材料，按捺不住心中的怒火，愤极，恨极！
    第三批材料，铁证如山，证明了胡风反革命集团的反动政治背景。胡风集团不是一个什么简单的“文艺集团”，而是蒋介石匪帮在祖国大陆上的另一支别动队，比土匪、恶霸、武装特务、间谍更加阴险，更加凶残的反革命集团。胡风“联络”“争取”了一批帝国主义特务分子、反动军官、托洛茨基分子、革命叛徒、自首变节分子，集旧社会反动渣滓之大成。二十年来，胡风和胡风集团分子混入革命阵营，装着进步的面孔，向文艺战线，向一切革命知识分子，向领导我们革命的核心力量——中国共产党，肆行凶狠、顽强的进攻，腐蚀我们的革命思想，瓦解我们的革命组织，夺取我们的革命阵地。解放以后，他们又同美帝国主义的走狗，窃据在台湾的蒋介石匪帮内应外合，妄想使反革命势力在中国复辟。但是他们失败了，他们的阴谋被揭穿了，在中国共产党领导下的不可战胜的人民力量，是一小撮反革命蟊贼所不能估计的。
    各方面揭露的材料，已经很多了，我认为有必要从以下两个问题，来补充揭露胡风反革命集团的反动政治背景。
    第一、是关于“泥土”社的问题。
    一九四七、一九四八年，正当人民解放战争取得节节胜利，蒋介石匪帮残酷镇压民主革命运动的时候，由胡风集团所编辑的文艺刊物“泥土”在北方的文艺界，特别是在京津各大学校得到广泛的发行。
    “泥土”披着进步刊物的外衣，有时候也发表一些进步作家写的东西，也骂一骂一些和国民党反动派有着明显勾结行为的反动文人，伪装进步，点缀门面。但是实质上是由胡风集团所把持的反动刊物。在马克思列宁主义理论的外衣下，大量刊登胡风和胡风集团骨干分子阿垅、路翎、舒芜、冀汸、牛汉等人的文章，狂热地宣传和贩卖反动的主观唯心主义的货色，满篇都充斥了什么“主观战斗精神”“自我扩张”“人格力量”等反动的理论。在刊物上，他们互相大肆吹嘘捧场，仇视进步作家，特别是当时在香港主办“大众文艺丛刊”的共产党员作家胡绳、乔冠华、邵荃麟等同志，肆行恶毒的攻击和咒骂。
    “泥土”对当时反对蒋介石集团反动统治，激励人民群众觉悟的文艺作品，像陈白尘同志的“升官图”，对当时在国民党统治区起着广泛宣传作用的、为广大人民群众所喜好的袁水拍同志的“马凡陀的山歌”，都给以下流的卑劣的辱骂。
    批评“泥土”的文章，被污蔑为“嘁嘁嚓嚓的屑小式……的理论”、“骂街式的文字”。批评
  “泥土”的作家，则被咒骂为“吹捧批评家”“惯于依老卖老的、才子流氓炫学家三位一体的无条件反射论者”。
    在当时，我们就感到有问题，为什么“泥土”总是和我们的意见不一致，总是和我们完全对立。最近读了“人民日报”所发表的三批材料，才恍然大悟，问题就是这样！从第三批材料中所揭发出来的事实，完全证明胡风和胡风集团的骨干分子像阿垅、绿原等人，原来就是国民党的特务分子，反动军官，就是在蒋记陆军大学聆听蒋贼“训话”的分子，就是在“中美合作所”工作的特务，问题完全清楚了。
    从最近揭发出来的材料也可以说明：解放以前，为什么我们的刊物出版那样困难，几天就被封闭，而胡风集团的刊物，却可以通行无阻，到处充斥。为什么进步的作家被逮捕，被杀害，而胡风及其党羽，却可以在一九四八年反革命敌人面临死亡前夕，残酷镇压革命运动的日子里，安稳的游逛于上海杭州之间，原来他们本是一家人，是一个蛇窟里的毒蛇！
    其次，是关于闻一多先生参加革命队伍的问题。
    闻一多先生，是我的朋友，同志。谁都知道，抗日战争胜利前后，他积极英勇地参加了当时在西南掀起的民主革命运动，为反动派所仇视，最后终于贡献了自己的生命。作为在党的领导下英勇参加革命斗争的革命知识分子代表的闻一多先生，长期为人民所尊敬、怀念和学习。
    反革命分子胡风，一面写点文章，说什么“要把这一次暗杀当作新的反动进攻的信号”，另一方面却无耻恶毒地诬蔑、咒骂“闻一多当然是投机，但他投中了，只好奉承他”。
    闻一多先生的死，许多人都知道，但是闻一多先生是在什么样的情况下参加革命斗争的，许多人却是不十分清楚的。
    我有责任说清楚这个情况。
    记得，当时一多在昆明西南联合大学教书。那时的昆明，恐怖气氛笼罩着，特务横行，暗杀、逮捕事件层出不穷；日本帝国主义占领了湖南、贵州；人民生活水平急剧下降，西南人民面临着巨大的危险和灾难。许多人害怕了，退缩了，准备逃跑了。这时，一多和我们一起，做了许多工作，国民党匪帮恫吓要暗杀他。空气十分紧张。
    一多参加民主革命运动以后，思想上有了很大的变化，用诗人、学者的笔和口舌，抱着“跨出了门，就不再跨回来”的态度，夜以继日地为革命事业工作，直到英勇的牺牲，献出了自己的生命。
    我要说明的是一多是在国民党匪帮恫吓他，要暗杀他的恐怖气氛中，参加到革命斗争队伍里来的。
    一多参加了革命行列，国民党匪帮痛恨之至，用美制无声手枪暗杀；一多参加了革命行列，胡风也痛恨之至，咒骂他是“投机”！一个用枪，一个用笔，立场是一样的。就从这个事实，难道还不能证明胡风就是蒋匪帮的贴己人吗！
    从已经揭发的三批材料看来，胡风反革命集团一贯仇视革命、仇视进步力量的罪恶行动，在中华人民共和国成立以来，不但没有减弱，反而更加疯狂，更加顽强了。他们和蒋介石残余匪帮隔海相对，制定反革命的策略和计划，猖狂进攻，仇恨新社会的一切，梦想人民革命政权的灭亡。难道这些铁证，还不足以说明胡风集团的反革命政治背景，还不能给胡风集团的性质作出结论吗？不，完全可以了，完全是时候了。
    党敲了警钟，我们揭露胡风反党反人民反革命集团的工作，取得了初步的胜利，但是坚决、彻底地清查和镇压胡风反革命集团，把这个中国人民革命事业的脓疱完全割下来，仍然还是全国人民今后的重大任务。不到最后的胜利，决不收兵，这是全国人民共同的意志和决心。一切胡风集团分子都必须老老实实地彻底向人民交代，听候人民的处置，胆敢顽抗，执迷不悟的分子，将会受到人民严厉的制裁。
    坚决消灭暗藏的反革命分子
    王崇伦
    我是一个普通的青年刨工，过去没有看过胡风的东西，也不知胡风是什么人。现在看了“人民日报”先后公布的三批材料，才知道胡风是披着革命外衣，钻进革命阵营，长期进行破坏活动的蒋介石的忠实走狗，是我们工人阶级和全国人民最凶恶最阴险的敌人。我对胡风及其反革命集团罪恶活动，感到无比的愤怒，我同意彻底查清胡风反革命集团的一切真相，撤销胡风一切职务和全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并依法给以严办。
    胡风反革命集团的揭露，是我们工人阶级和全国人民的一个巨大胜利。但是胡风反革命集团和类似胡风的反革命分子，他们反党反人民反革命的罪恶活动，是有计划有步骤的，他们的方法是巧妙的毒辣的。如果我们以为揭露了胡风反革命集团，就万事大吉了，这是很危险的。我们必须把一切暗藏的反革命分子都揭露出来，不消灭他们，我们就不能有好日子过。
    无论在过去或现在，我们工人阶级都是站在斗争的最前列，我们的理想就是要把我们的国家很快地建成社会主义社会。胡风反革命集团的事件给我们一个最大的教训，就是要我们时时刻刻地提高警惕性，随时防止一切暗藏的反革命分子活动，并给以坚决的彻底的打击。只要我们这样一致地行动起来，不管反革命分子如何狡猾隐蔽，都一定会被我们识破和揭露出来的，也只有这样，才能保卫我们革命的胜利成果。
    爱国的基督徒要加倍提高警惕
    陈见真
    “人民日报”发表了胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，不能不使每一个反帝爱国的中国基督徒感到无比的愤怒。我们不能不认识到这个罪恶集团的阴险，毒辣，卑鄙可耻，同时更认识到中国人民力量的强大。一贯玩弄两面派手法的胡风，和他的反党反人民的集团，企图颠覆人民革命政权，破坏祖国社会主义建设。这种卑鄙的阴谋已经在中国人民面前原形毕露了，这是我国社会主义革命中的一大胜利。我们中国基督徒认为胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格应即撤销；而且应该给予胡风和胡风分子应得的惩罚。
    胡风事件的揭发，对于我们中国基督徒来说，是一个极其深刻的教育。因为在我们当中，很多人对于这样暗藏的反革命分子，是认识不足的；尤其是警惕性不高，甚至有时丧失了警惕性。就拿我自己来说，在看到关于胡风反革命集团的第一批材料时，还以为这仅是思想问题，是文艺界的问题，而未认识到这个集团对于全国人民和我国社会主义建设的重大危害。这就说明了：今后我们必须加强学习，提高政治嗅觉，提高警惕性，才能同胡风反革命集团及一切暗藏的反革命分子作不懈的斗争。
    四年多来中国基督教三自爱国运动，在全国人民的支持下，和全国基督徒的努力下，已经取得了肯定的胜利，但是无孔不入的帝国主义分子仍是死不甘心，他们以各种各样隐蔽的欺骗的手法，企图破坏我们反帝爱国的大团结。因此我们全国基督徒，必须加倍提高警惕，进一步加强团结，揭露一切暗藏在我们基督教内的任何反革命分子。我们和全国人民更加团结一致，为伟大的社会主义改造和建设事业而奋斗。
    加强民族团结，粉碎反革命阴谋
    桑吉悦希
    最近“人民日报”上连续发表的材料，已完全揭穿了胡风集团反党、反人民的狰狞面目。原来他们并不是什么具有小资产阶级观点的分子，而是一个阴谋破坏我们祖国大家庭，企图使各族人民重新回到帝国主义和蒋匪统治下的反革命集团。胡风反革命集团是我们各族人民的敌人，我们要求撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并坚决镇压胡风反革命集团。
    从这件事情上，我们少数民族应得到极大的教训。反革命分子是无孔不入的，尤其我们藏族地区，地处偏僻的边疆，政治经济文化还落后，反革命分子往往利用这些情况，潜藏于民族地区，披着各种外衣，挑拨民族之间的团结，制造民族内部的械斗，或进行其他极端毒辣的破坏活动，以达到破坏民族团结的罪恶目的。因此，我们藏族地区的全体工作人员和人民，必须百倍地提高革命警惕性，加强马克思主义和民族政策的学习，加强民族之间和民族内部的团结，粉碎一切反革命分子的阴谋活动，保卫各民族团结的幸福的祖国大家庭。
    依法严惩胡风反革命集团
    王家楫
    我是一个自然科学工作者，过去不但不认识胡风，而且从未看过胡风的作品。当文艺界开始批判胡风时，我很麻痹大意，不十分去注意。一直等到看见“人民日报”所揭露的关于他的反革命集团的第一批材料，才大吃一惊，认识到胡风集团的极端反动性。以后再看了他们的第二批反党、反人民的材料，更加深了我的愤怒，并料想胡风一定有他反动的政治背景。果然，现在第三批反革命材料又发表了，证实了胡风是帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的一个特务头子。他和他的喽啰们居然能够很久隐藏在我们革命的队伍中，这就表明了他们的阴谋极端毒辣、他们的诡计极端狡猾。胡风和他的喽啰们已经给革命事业带来不少危害，欺骗了不少青年和各地党组织。我们绝对不能再容忍下去了，必须赶快把他们从我们的革命队伍中清洗出去，立即撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格，依法严惩。
    反革命分子既然会混入我们文艺工作者的队伍，当然也有可能会钻进我们自然科学工作者的队伍。如果我们还是麻痹大意，只顾业务，忽视政治，反革命分子就有机会侵入到我们的队伍中来。因此今后自然科学工作者需要百倍提高警惕，大大地加强马克思列宁主义的学习，严肃认真地改造自己，紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，这样才能随时随地可以明辨是非，分清敌我，彻底粉碎像胡风这样的暗藏着的反革命分子。
    大家起来搜查坐探
    杨之华
    对胡风反革命集团的斗争是一场严重的阶级斗争。这不是表示表示态度的问题，而是要采取有效的实际行动，搜查隐藏在每一个角落里的反革命分子，直到反革命集团彻底粉碎为止；因此，这是一场较长期的激烈的阶级斗争！
    远在二十多年以前，一九三三年年底，当瞿秋白同志进入江西的革命根据地以后，党曾派我到鲁迅先生那里去过几次。最后一次去鲁迅先生家，是在一九三四年年底。我见鲁迅先生身体很瘦弱，心境很不愉快。他对人向来是很诚恳和爽直的，那一天的谈话为过去从未有过的。他突然很动气地说：“你们敌我不清，为什么攻击一个正在攻击敌人的人？”当时我很惊奇，为什么他说出这样的话？鲁迅先生是我们的朋友，我们是尊敬他的，怎么会攻击他呢？从我自己参加党的组织工作中，体会到当时党的组织被破坏得很厉害，是因为有坐探在党内外活动。当时左联的情形也很复杂。因此，我向鲁迅先生解释：“正因为你同我党的政治关系较密切，敌人极仇恨，我们要防止敌人的造谣中伤、挑拨离间。”我虽然从政治上嗅到有敌人在挑拨离间我们的关系，但我没有参加左联的具体工作，不知道究竟是谁在造谣？从这次斗争中，才知道原来就是可耻的胡风！
    在阶级关系上来说，那时胡风是在国民党的政权下进行活动的，条件较顺利；而在解放以后的新中国，地主阶级、官僚资本家被打倒了，蒋介石匪帮被赶出中国大陆，反革命的活动愈来愈困难，因此，敌人对党和人民民主政权愈来愈仇恨，这是阶级的仇恨。在第三批胡风反革命集团的材料中，透彻地暴露出这种仇恨到了这样的程度：“几乎恨一切人”。这正是没落阶级最后的疯狂的叫嚣。这正是胡风分子所说的：“让人们疯狂，从疯狂里灭亡。”胡风反革命集团已经把自己的坟墓掘好了，从高台上掉了下来了！虽然，胡风分子自己掘好自己的坟墓，但自己不会甘心走进坟墓去的，还想从坟墓里爬出来，爬到每个看不见的角落里去躲起来，像地下灰色的毒蛇一样，见人就咬。这种毒蛇不仅文化团体里有，在每个组织内都会有，在工厂企业机关里也曾发现过反革命的活动。为此，工会要动员男女职工及其家属群众在每个角落里进行搜查灰色的坐探的工作。这是我们光荣的任务。我们要积极动员起来，粉碎他们！
    提高警惕，同反革命分子作斗争
    苏步青
    读了“人民日报”发表的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”，我感到无限愤怒。中国共产党好容易把我们从黑暗的国民党反动统治下面解放出来，今天万众一心在党和政府的正确领导下，一定要把祖国建设成为消灭贫困消灭剥削的社会主义社会。我们反对美国帝国主义庇护卖国集团霸占我们的领土台湾，大家更要团结一致，为解放台湾而奋斗。而胡风和胡风集团分子很早以来就是蒋介石的走狗，长期地伪装革命，潜伏在人民内部，企图颠覆我们革命事业，这是六亿人民所不容许的行为。我们必须把胡风和他的集团中的骨干分子从人民队伍中清除出去，来保证我们伟大的社会主义建设的顺利进行。
    作为数学工作者的我，解放以来虽然参加了各种伟大的政治运动和经常的政治学习，但是对于反革命分子的警惕性大大地不够。在这次开展胡风反动思想批判的初期，我还以为这是属于文艺思想的范围，同数学没有多大关系的。直到我所在的高等学校发见胡风集团分子贾植芳的时候，我才大吃一惊。他伪装进步教授，混入我们大学达三年之久，经常向年青一代散布毒素。这样的反革命分子居然就在我们的面前。而我站在教学行政工作负责的地位，对于贾植芳这样的反革命行为不但没有加以应有的研究调查，而且在看到“人民日报”发表的第二批材料时，思想上还以为贾植芳仅是胡风集团中的被骗分子，没有能够提高对反革命分子的警惕性。这是由于我的马克思列宁主义基础太差，不能分析事物。所以，我要加强学习马克思列宁主义理论，提高政治觉悟，纠正以往我们高等知识分子容易犯的发牢骚等不正确的态度，免予反革命分子以可乘的机会。我们在国家过渡到社会主义的时期中必须坚决地同阶级敌人作无情的斗争。
    严惩反革命的胡风分子
    陈其瑗　熊瑾玎  杨素兰　浦化人
    我们看到“人民日报”先后披露的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，和六月十日的社论，我们感到非常愤怒。胡风集团是最反动最阴险的阶级敌人的代表人物。他们所憎恨和反对的不只是马克思列宁主义的理论，不只是共产党人，党内外文艺工作者，而且是在共产党领导下，站起来的所有人民。他们憎恨新中国的一切，他们把解放了的新社会说成“脏臭的铁壁”。他们的唯一的罪恶目的是千方百计钻进共产党、机关、团体、学校……在革命队伍里破坏我们社会主义建设事业，妄想使帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义在中国大陆复辟。他们要使解放了的工人再做资本家的奴隶；使已得良田的农民再为地主流汗而不得一饱；使为工农兵服务的知识分子再无“用武之地”；使已得平等权利的妇女失去学习、工作、婚姻自由而再过悲惨生活。解放以来，无数铁的事实证明：工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的政权日益巩固，经济、国防、文化建设一日千里地迈进，国际地位日益提高，人民的力量是无穷的，胡风集团的丑恶妄想毫无疑问是不会实现的。
    我们不是文艺工作者，而是救济机关的监察工作者。我们救济福利界的同志对胡风集团的斗争应当积极参加，把各个角落的胡风分子揭露出来，一网打净。同时，我们也要认识到：就算胡风集团经过大家努力而彻底消灭了，我们也不应该高枕无忧。阶级敌人越快要灭亡，他们越要派遣更多的形形色色的特务间谍，用最无耻和隐蔽的两面派手法钻到我们内部来活动。今后我们都要擦亮眼睛，提高警惕，同一切不拿枪的敌人展开长期的艰苦的斗争。我们的工作人员绝大多数是好人，但可能有极少数的坏人钻进革命队伍暗中作祟。假使我们不提高警惕，他们就会蔓延滋长，张牙舞爪，使多数好人辛辛苦苦的劳动果实受到不应有的损失。监察人员如果怕困难，怕得罪人而不深入群众去摸底，不到生产教养部门去检查监督，监察通讯员也不及时反映情况，那么，连好干部也可能变坏，放松或轻视监察就像部队不放哨兵，不放警戒，不出去巡逻，那就是政治麻痹，使阶级敌人有隙可乘，胡风分子也就不会根除了。
    这次大张旗鼓地清算胡风集团的斗争，的确是一件大事，是广大群众所热烈拥护的伟大斗争，这是我们在政治上打了一个大的胜仗。我们救济福利界也像其他各界一样，只要好好学习，积极参加斗争，政治警惕性是会提高的。因而我们要满怀信心地学习辩证唯物主义，肃清主观唯心主义的思想残余，努力工作，改进工作，把革命队伍里一切反革命分子扫除出去！
    不使一个胡风分子漏网
    黄子卿
    我是一个科学工作者，过去对文艺作品素不感兴趣，在揭发胡风和他的集团的反革命行为以前，我连他的名字都没有听见过。经揭发后，我才知道这个反革命集团隐藏在革命队伍里进行阴谋破坏活动。从第三批发表的材料里，我知道了他们早就同国民党蒋匪帮有密切联系，他们企图从内部来推翻我们的人民政权，恢复万恶的蒋匪帮统治，使我们从社会主义的光明道路回到封建的殖民地的黑暗道路上去。关于这个反人民反革命的集团，我要求人民政府彻底清查他们的一切罪行，不使一个胡风分子漏网，依法严厉惩办他们。
    谈到这里，我有点体会：在过去的社会，知识分子从小就受到“往上爬”的教育，这样的个人主义往前发展，就变为个人英雄主义，因为要做个人英雄，就不择手段推翻在他上面的人。我们必须克服个人主义，因为有个人主义思想的人，就很容易被反革命集团所利用，因此是非常危险的。我们一定要去掉个人主义。我们要学习马克思列宁主义，建立辩证唯物的世界观。工人阶级的一切作为，都为人民大众着想，这里绝不允许有损人利己的个人主义和资产阶级的唯心的哲学。只有学好马克思主义，才能站稳立场，不受反革命集团的引诱。
    继续战斗，彻底肃清胡风分子
    袁文殊
    胡风集团到底是一个什么性质的集团，现在铁证如山，已经真相大白了。胡风集团是一个彻头彻尾的反革命的阴谋集团，是一个特务集团。那些“天真”的人们，当不会有什么怀疑了吧，那些反革命的胡风分子更是无法狡赖了。
    这是我们在过渡到社会主义社会去的时期中，同反革命分子进行斗争中所获得的一次伟大胜利。但是战斗并没有结束。
    这个反革命集团，一向采取的是两面派的活动方式。这种敌人，比那公开地进行杀人放火的敌人更加阴险，更加恶毒。他们披着马克思主义的外衣，伪装革命，骗取我们对他们的信任。我们长期处在一起而不加戒备。例如我们电影部门中的胡风分子，因为他伪装进步，我们也就相信他是“进步的作家”，不论从工作上或生活上都尽量地给予他帮助和照顾，我们和他朝夕相处而未觉察。
    但是敌人潜伏在我们队伍里面，却时时刻刻在“窥测方向”，钻我们的空子，“深入到”我们
  “肝脏里面”来，利用我们某些人的自由主义，偷窃机密，探听情报，挑拨离间，兴风作浪；他们对某些犯过错误，受过批评的人，进行拉拢争取，使其陷入圈套，和他们一起作罪恶的勾当。他们不断地在我们的队伍中“联络人”、“争取人”、“从事开辟工作”、“大大地加强实力”，从文艺部门发展到文化、教育、党、团、工会、财经和部队等等各个部门中去。他们从各个方面来向党、向革命进行猖狂的进攻，妄想帝国主义和蒋介石的反动政权复辟。敌人是阴险的，同时又是狡猾的。因此，我们决不能以为胡风反革命集团现在已经揭发了，从此就会天下太平，可以高枕无忧。不能，我们决不能再有一点麻痹大意，必须从这次事件中吸取经验教训，认真地克服自由主义，百倍地提高警惕！
    只有彻底肃清胡风分子和一切反革命的敌人，才能保证我们革命文艺事业的顺利发展，才能保证我国伟大的社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。
    决不允许反革命分子进行破坏活动
    庞薰琹
    狼是狠的，蛇是毒的。胡风反革命黑帮是更狠更毒。他们伪装进步，混进革命文艺工作者的队伍里，混进各种机关，甚至于混进党内。他们脸上装出微笑，背地里却用神经战、挖心战，用深入到“肝脏里面去”、孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术，用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕的恶毒办法，用装死、布疑阵、集束手榴弹等等战术，来进行反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋活动。他们并且规定了战斗的长期性，以五年为期，妄想动摇二十年来党所领导的革命工作、文艺战线和党的文艺方针。他们对解放后的新社会，对人民革命政权有着刻骨的仇恨，他们诅咒中国人民革命力量是“枯黄的叶子”，是“腐朽的尸体”。他们还妄想使党所领导的中国人民革命力量“呜呼完蛋”。胡风反革命黑帮就是这样狠、这样毒。而且他们是狡猾的、隐蔽的。
    但是，不论胡风及其喽啰们如何的狡猾，他们的丑恶真面目终究是隐藏不了的。现在我们已经清楚地认识了这一批反革命黑帮的政治背景是什么和他们的主子是谁了。原来胡风在二十多年前就在干反共的政治工作，他的集团中的骨干是一些反动军官、帝国主义国民党特务分子、革命叛徒和地主反革命分子等等。所以胡风问题不是什么思想问题，胡风集团也不仅仅是什么宗派活动的问题，它是一个彻头彻尾的反革命组织。
    今天我们要告诉这些反革命分子：要灭亡的是你们。
    我们衷心热烈地拥护由先烈用鲜血建立起来的人民革命政权。我们衷心热烈地拥护中国共产党。我们也衷心热烈地拥护共产党所确定的文艺方向。我们决不允许反革命分子进行破坏活动！
    扑灭蒋介石卖国集团的一个黑帮
    曹玉珊
    我在看人民日报所公布的关于胡风反革命集团的材料时，越看越恨，无法抑止我的愤怒。胡风这个钻进革命阵营的反党反人民的反革命分子，在这二十多年来的反革命活动，对党和人民的事业的危害，是无法计量的。胡风反革命集团在全国胜利后的几年中，日益猖狂起来，而且做好了他的一切准备工作：有理论，有计划，有组织，有纲领。胡风反革命集团的狠毒同屠杀中国人民的老刽子手蒋介石的狠毒，实不相上下。胡风反革命集团污蔑中国人民革命的武装是“匪军”，是“脓”。这和杀人不眨眼的蒋介石匪帮有何区别呢？“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”里铁证如山，胡风就是蒋介石卖国集团的一个黑帮。一个在台湾，一个在大陆，干着同样的勾当。
    当着我国进入了伟大的社会主义革命与社会主义改造的时候，蒋介石匪帮与胡风集团像热锅上的蚂蚁一样，为挽救自己死亡的命运，为反对社会主义革命，便前呼后应地进行着反革命勾当。蒋介石在台湾依附着美帝国主义叫嚣反攻大陆，而胡风反革命集团也就向党向人民作了恶毒的进攻。胡风集团的罪行已获得蒋介石在台湾的大声喝彩了。胡风的阴谋在被揭发之后就心焦火燎地鼓舞他的喽啰们：“不要痛苦，千万冷静。……在忍受中求得重生，一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来！”胡风这些鼓舞，不是明明要他的党徒们接待他的主子回大陆是什么！不是要卖国贼蒋介石死灰复燃，卷土重来屠杀中国人民是什么！这不是要变自由的美好的中国为美帝国主义殖民地是什么！难道胡风不是与蒋介石里应外合地准备颠覆六亿人民的中华人民共和国吗？不难理解，这就是胡风的所谓“重生”，
  “事业”“远大的未来”的实质所在。从“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”里，清清楚楚地可以看出：胡风集团的反革命是水有源，木有本的，是同美蒋特务合流的。不管这一群反革命分子野心多大，胃口多强，如何妄图死灰复燃，怎样装的“乐观”，都不过是些自欺欺人的把戏，绝不能挽救他们自己和他们的主子的灭亡的命运。
    现在，我们揭开了胡风反革命集团的阴险面目，而且给了严重的打击。这是我们在过渡时期对敌斗争的又一次大胜利。但是我们还要严加警惕，擦亮眼睛，提高嗅觉，再接再厉，加倍努力，向胡风反革命集团连续追击，把它打得落花流水，彻底扑灭它。
    镇压反革命活动，保卫社会主义建设事业
    中国人民解放军驻北京某部政治部文化部刘佳、胡可、张志民、徐光耀、高焰等二十一人来信：我们都是在北京的中国人民解放军文艺工作者。读了
  “关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”后，立即举行了声讨胡风反革命集团的座谈会，到会全体同志都表示异常愤怒。第三批材料，使我们进一步看清了胡风集团原来是一群同帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的反革命黑帮。特别使我们愤怒的是：他们混到我们革命队伍里来，混到我们党内来，长期潜伏在我们的内部，用两面派的手段对我们的革命事业进行疯狂的破坏。他们对我们党的胜利和人民的解放有刻骨的仇恨，把我们伟大的中国共产党污蔑为
  “万恶的共匪”，把我们人民解放军污蔑为“匪军”！而对于蒋介石所发动的反革命内战感到“乐观”，对蒋介石的“训话”的“自信”感到“鼓舞”。他们同国民党的特务头子有亲密的来往，和国民党的特务机关“中统”有密切的联系，有在“中美合作所”“工作”的，有当国民党军官的。他们的主子是谁，难道还不明白吗？
    这一群匪徒对我们的破坏是处心积虑的，也是无孔不入的。他们是蒋介石匪帮埋伏在我国大陆上的特务组织。但他们不同于一般的特务，他们披着马克思列宁主义外衣，以“文艺”作幌子，混进我们的队伍里来，用种种卑鄙手段挑拨离间，瓦解革命组织，这些阴谋诡计，比枪炮炸药要厉害的多！
    狐狸的尾巴是藏不住的，任何阴谋诡计也逃不出人民的眼睛。现在，这群匪徒的伪装被剥掉了，他们的革命招牌被摘掉了，这些家伙们在光天化日之下显了原形，他们的面目是如此的狰狞，他们的嘴脸是如此的丑恶！他们是蒋介石匪帮的忠实奴仆，他们是中国人民的死敌！对这些家伙们，我们认为只有严厉镇压，不能有丝毫宽容，如果对他们抱有任何幻想，那简直是太天真了。
    过去由于我们政治警惕性不高，因而长期同
  “老虎”睡在一起，竟未能及时发觉。现在由于党的英明领导，使我们在这一斗争中提高了认识，使我们头脑清醒了，眼睛明亮了。我们要在这一事件中吸取教训，加强学习，克服麻痹思想，提高警惕，在党的领导下，积极战斗，不彻底消灭胡风反革命集团决不罢休！
    解放军公安部队某部战士于福忠来信：我怀着激怒愤慨的心情，看完了揭露胡风反革命集团的第三批材料。我再也不能沉默了，我要大声疾呼：严惩胡风，彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团！
    铁证如山的事实，说明了胡风及其反革命集团的首要分子，根本就不是什么文艺工作者，而是地地道道的蒋介石卖国贼的走狗、特务、流氓，是我们的死敌。当我们国家，在党和毛主席的领导下，朝着幸福的社会主义前进的时候，这些伪装起来的反革命分子，却向我们最敬爱的党和人民进行疯狂的进攻，企图颠覆我们的人民民主专政的政权。今天真相大白，胡风及其反革命集团丑恶的面貌已经暴露在光天化日之下了。对待反革命分子，我们不能留情，只有坚决把他们镇压下去，人民才能过好日子，我们的事业才能前进。因此我要大声疾呼：严惩胡风，彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团！
    中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会暨北京市委员会机关工作人员骆介子、梁纶才、万枚子等五十八人来信：我们先后读了“人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，激起了莫大的愤怒。从这许多惊心怵目的材料中，我们更加认清了这个反革命集团狰狞丑恶的真面目。胡风及其反革命集团长期以来，就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，同帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切联系，他们外面披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，背地里干着反党、反人民、反革命的罪恶勾当。胡风反革命集团是人民的死敌。我们同胡风反革命集团誓不两立，一定要坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团。我们要求政府对胡风反革命集团中的怙恶不悛分子，给以严厉的惩治。
    在这次惊心动魄的斗争中，是伟大的中国共产党擦亮了我们的眼睛，让我们的头脑清醒过来。在我们建设社会主义的事业中，一分一秒也麻痹不得的。我们一定要提高政治觉悟，更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，揭露镇压一切暗藏的反革命分子，保卫我们的建设社会主义的伟大事业。
    财政部税务总局中国民主建国会会员崔敬伯、任子良等十五人、中国民主同盟盟员杜弘如、李明轩等四人、中国国民党革命委员会党员王文鼎、彭宗杰、中国农工民主党党员许星辉来信：我们读了
  “人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料和有关文件后，引起了我们的无比愤恨。胡风集团的这种反党、反人民、反革命的罪恶活动，是决不能令人容忍的。我们必须坚决地把这一群丧心病狂、危害社会主义革命事业的敌人，从革命队伍中清洗出去。我们建议原选举单位立即撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格。我们要求政府彻底追查胡风反革命集团分子，分别情节予以惩处和镇压。我们警告所有胡风反革命集团分子和暗藏在革命队伍中的一切反革命分子，要老老实实地、毫无保留地向人民彻底交代问题。我们各民主党派的成员，将坚决地继续投入反对胡风反革命集团的斗争，协助政府肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，并进一步深入学习马克思列宁主义，提高阶级觉悟，提高警惕，严格划清敌我界限，加强自我批评和自我改造，紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，为彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，进一步巩固人民民主专政和加速祖国社会主义建设事业而奋斗。
    北京地质学院孙荣圭来信：六月十日早晨，从广播中听到“人民日报”公布了“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”的消息。吃完早饭，同学们几乎每个人都买了一份当天的“人民日报”，大家一面读着，一面喊出自己的愤怒的话，要求严惩胡风！事情极其明显了：胡风反革命集团的骨干是一群最卑鄙，最阴狠毒辣，最下流的敌人。看了这批材料，我们对于在过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性体会得更深刻更具体了。胡风事件对于我们青年人是一次重大的政治教育，我们是一辈子也不会忘记的。
    正像“人民日报”社论中指出的：“如果胡风反革命集团能够混到我们的队伍中来，甚至混到共产党的队伍中来，为什么别的反革命分子不能用类似胡风的两面派手法，暗藏在我们的机关、部队、学校、工矿、人民团体和民主党派中呢？应该说，他们必然会混进来，而且已有材料证明在许多地方已混进来了。”
    而过去，有的同学却认为：学校里阶级斗争不尖锐，但是这种“天真的”（应该说是麻痹的）说法被事实推翻了。胡风反革命集团的骨干分子，蒋贼军官阿垅不就是在南开大学里大肆进行反革命活动，进行毒害青年的勾当的吗？看来，这种“天真”是多么危险呀！我们必须提高革命警惕，使一切坏分子的阴谋活动都无法得逞，这样才能保卫我们的社会主义建设事业！
    北京市西四区职工业余学校全体教职员工来信：“人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，完全证实了胡风集团是一个极端反动的特务集团。他们狡猾地采取两面派的手法，披着马克思主义的外衣，伪装革命，进行反党、反人民、反革命的勾当。所谓搞文艺是幌子，他们的真正职业是特务。我们看了这三批材料后，非常愤怒。我们要求严厉镇压胡风和阿垅等首恶分子，彻底清查胡风反革命集团的其他分子。
    燃料工业部水力发电招待所陈德森来信：我是一个物资技术供应工作者。我看过党报发表的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，更加激起了我无限的愤恨。从已经发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料看来，很明显，胡风集团是一个彻头彻尾的反革命阴谋组织。如果说在这三批材料没有发表以前，对于胡风集团的主观唯心主义的哲学思想的批判，我曾经认为是文艺思想问题，并且还没有认识到这一斗争的严重意义的话，那么，现在我应该感谢党擦亮了我的眼睛，使我认识了胡风和胡风分子的反动面目，这次斗争是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    二十多年来，胡风反革命集团一直披着马克思主义的外衣，以“文艺工作者”作幌子，进行反革命活动。他们妄想“肃清”人民武装力量，仇恨人民革命的胜利，希望人民政权“完蛋”，他们几乎恨一切人。他们很懂得要使蒋介石能够在中国复辟，首先要从破坏党下手，因此他们向党实行疯狂的进攻，并且“用最大诚恳写过三次报告，一次比一次详尽而老实”“深入到”我们的“肝脏里面”来从事反革命活动。但是，他们至死也许不能理解这完全是梦想。真理总是真理，真理总是要胜利的。我们有巩固的人民民主专政，有自下而上千百万觉悟群众的支持，有党的坚强领导，有党的英明政策，无论反革命集团怎么阴险，怎样伪装，他们最后是要露出狐狸尾巴的。我坚决要求彻底追查胡风集团的罪行，给他们以严厉镇压。
    通过胡风反革命集团事件，我更加认识到在过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性。敌人的破坏活动是阴险的，并且是无孔不入的。因此我们必须吸取这次事件的教训，努力学习马克思主义，提高阶级警惕性和政治敏感，坚决同一切反革命分子斗争到底，把反革命分子肃清。
    沈阳油漆厂杨培益来信：我是一个工厂的职员。在“人民日报”公布了关于胡风反革命集团的两批材料后，虽然我已认识到胡风集团是一个反党、反人民的反革命集团，但仍然没有想到，胡风反革命集团的后台老板，就是中国人民的死敌蒋介石。看了第三批材料之后，才进一步认清了胡风反革命集团是国民党特务分子控制下的一个反革命组织，胡风等人，则是多年潜伏在革命阵营里的特务首脑。
    作为工人阶级里的一名成员，我从这一次重大的政治斗争所得的教育是深刻的。由于自己思想的麻痹，以致开始对这场严重的政治斗争未能认识清楚。今后我一定要加强思想锻炼，提高政治敏感，以便能正确地辨明是非，认清披着伪装的敌人。同时为了保卫我们的社会主义建设事业，我要求政府根据法律，对胡风等反革命分子予以严厉的镇压。
    严惩怙恶不悛的反革命分子
    沈阳电池厂邹洵来信：读了“人民日报”发表的胡风反革命集团的几批材料，我们万分愤恨。同时，也感到在革命胜利了的今天，阶级斗争更加尖锐，反革命分子将会千方百计来破坏革命事业，我们要百倍地提高政治警惕。
    胡风及其反革命集团的罪恶活动，是非常毒辣、阴险的，而且也是万分可耻的。从已经揭露的材料来看，胡风反革命集团不但有他一套反革命的纲领，而且还有他一套严密的组织。他收罗了国民党的反动军官、美蒋特务分子，以及封建地主反革命分子，从祖国的北方到广东，从政府机关到人民团体，从工矿企业到部队学校，以至于到我们党内，到处建立“据点”，秘密通讯，进行着反革命活动。
    我是工矿企业的一个工作者，前一个时期由于政治警惕性不高，对于这件事情是不够关心的，最近，从这几批材料的揭发，使我看清了胡风分子的罪恶，我要求政府对胡风迅速予以法办。
    山东坊子煤矿高兴贵来信：我是一个煤矿工作人员。读了“人民日报”所载胡风的假检讨，和关于胡风反动集团的第一和第二批材料后，本来已异常愤怒，但当我又逐字逐句地读了胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，真使我咬牙切齿，怒气填胸，再也抑止不住内心的愤怒，我要求惩办胡风。从第三批材料的揭发，更露骨，更彻头彻尾地证明了胡风集团是一个十足的反革命集团。胡风和他集团内的骨干分子，很早以前就是蒋贼的忠实走狗，就同蒋贼的特务机关保持着密切的联系。而他们却伪装革命，隐藏在我们的革命阵营里，用恶毒的两面派手法，进行着卑鄙的反革命活动，妄图颠覆人民政权。他们诅咒我们人民的革命政权“灭亡”，把我们人民的革命力量看作“脓”，要“一不做，二不休”的“排出”。他们千方百计地混入党内，窃取党的机密文件，里应外合地进行反革命活动。胡风集团分子张中晓说：“几乎恨一切人，……对这个社会秩序，我憎恨。”特别是胡风和其集团骨干分子的阿垅、绿原，他们都是满手血污的反革命分子。这个阴险的反革命集团，纵然手段巧妙，但也终于现出了罪恶的原形。
    我们要将这个祸害人民的反革命集团一网打尽，连根拔除，使他们永不发芽。
    中国文联研究部资料室刘纲来信：“人民日报”又揭发了胡风反革命集团的一批材料，胡风集团里的匪徒们，到底是些什么东西，已经很清楚了。这个反革命集团，包括了各种的反革命分子，是一个极阴险最毒辣的反革命集团。卖国贼，中统特务、反动军官、恶霸地主、叛徒，就是这个反革命集团的骨干。
    这些匪徒们，在抗日战争中，勾引着日本帝国主义，屠杀了我们数不清的父老兄弟和妻儿姊妹，至今那些被惨杀了的亲人面容，还深深地印在我们心中。在反围剿战争中，它们又用种种恶劣的手段，屠杀了我们的亲骨肉。至今我们想起来，还毛骨悚然。在我们家乡百户人家的庄子里，就有一二十户，全家大小一个不留地被他们给活埋了，火焚了，惨杀了。现在每逢想起我不满两周岁的小妹妹，被他们双手抓住两条小腿活活劈死的惨状，我身上就起鸡皮疙瘩。
    解放后，和这批刽子手们共命运的人，他们又用各种各样的卑鄙手腕，隐藏在我们的队伍里，企图来颠覆我们的政权，再让它们的主子帝国主义、蒋介石的反动政权复辟。
    他们反革命的万恶罪行，我们还能容忍吗？不！我们想过幸福的生活，就不能容忍这些万恶的匪徒们。我们要彻底清查未露形的反动分子，我们要搜捕向人民拒不坦白的反动分子。并要求政府把胡风反革命集团的胡风、阿垅等顽固不化、怙恶不悛的首恶分子，依法严惩，给我们昭雪血仇！
    沈阳辽宁人民出版社佟乃林来信：看了胡风反革命集团的三批材料，我一次比一次的愤怒。胡风集团的假面被剥去了，阴险毒辣，罪恶累累的反革命集团的丑恶面目原形毕露了。我们清楚了，为什么二十年来胡风集团那样仇视我们，谩骂我们，污蔑我们，攻击我们，这是胡风和他的主子帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮的本性。他们对于人民政权的胜利是死不瞑目的。为了达到他们复辟的目的，他们采取了一切卑鄙的手段，他们是无孔不入的。今天，在党的正确领导下，胡风集团的阴谋诡计被揭穿了，现在是彻底清算他们罪恶的时候了。我坚决要求对于胡风及胡风集团分子立即依法严惩。
    从胡风事件中，我们也吸取了教训，我们必须加强马克思列宁主义学习，克服资产阶级个人主义和骄傲自满情绪，百倍地警惕，严防反革命分子钻空子。彻底粉碎敌人的一切阴谋。以保障我们社会主义建设事业胜利进行。
    中华人民共和国国家建设委员会赵毅甫、石启荣、朱九江等十一人来信：看了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，我们对于胡风反革命集团所进行的反人民反革命的罪恶活动，更是感到无比的愤恨。胡风集团的假面具已彻底被揭穿，它的真面貌已经暴露出来了。胡风和他的一伙是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的反革命分子，它是我们人民的敌人，而且是最恶毒最凶狠最可怕的敌人。我们必须粉碎胡风集团，并把这些反革命分子从人民队伍中清除出去。
    对于这一批罪恶的反革命分子以及他们的罪恶活动，我们是不能漠不关心，不能把他们轻轻放过去的，我们要积极参加同胡风集团的斗争，把一切暗藏的胡风集团的反革命分子清查出来，并要求政府依法惩办他们。
    中央生物制品检定所全体职工来信：胡风反革命集团所进行的反党反人民反革命的罪恶活动，激起了我们全所同志的无比愤怒。他们竟敢以两面派的阴险毒辣手段，打着革命的假招牌，暗地进行着恶毒的反革命活动。他们并且是有纲领、有计划地向我们党进行猖狂的进攻。企图从根子上动摇我们的革命政权，以实现他们所谓“更远大的未来”。他们企图使他们的主子，人民公敌蒋介石反动势力在中国复辟。
    我们决不允许他们再继续进行阴谋活动，危害我们全国人民的社会主义建设事业。我们全体职工，坚决要求彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，将这群坏家伙们一网打尽，依法严惩他们。
    中国人民保险公司总公司全体工作人员来信：我们以无比愤怒的心情，读了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料。这批材料赤裸裸地揭穿了胡风集团是一个以“文艺”为幌子的反革命集团。铁一般的事实，证明了胡风集团是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系，美国帝国主义和国民党特务分子、反动军官、托洛茨基分子、革命叛徒、自首变节分子是这个集团的骨干分子。我们必须坚决、彻底地消灭这些反革命集团。
    我们的国家，正沿着社会主义的道路迅速前进，因之，阶级斗争也就越来越复杂和尖锐。胡风反革命集团的被揭露，再一次证明已经被打倒的和将要被消灭的剥削阶级，是不会甘心死亡的。他们是要千方百计地来破坏我们的社会主义事业。我们要从胡风事件中吸取深刻的教训，提高政治警惕性，提高对反革命分子的辨别能力。我们深深相信，只要全国人民紧紧地团结在中国共产党的周围，保持高度的政治警惕性，就能够清查出一切暗藏的反革命分子，保证伟大的社会主义建设的顺利进行。我们坚决要求彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，并把这一斗争深入到各个角落，把一切暗藏在我们革命队伍里的反革命分子清除出去。依照法律严惩他们。
    天津拖拉机制造学校全体教职员工来信：胡风反革命集团的反革命面貌完全暴露出来了，胡风本人早就和国民党匪帮的特务头子有着密切的联系，胡风反革命集团的骨干分子阿垅，曾经做过蒋贼的军事教官，绿原是“中美合作所”的特务……总之，他们完全是帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的忠实走狗，是我们广大人民不共戴天的死敌！
    不必再去具体地引用他们那些恶毒的反革命谰言了，我们再也压抑不住愤怒，我们决不能再容忍了！我们要求政府，坚决、彻底地镇压这批反革命分子，对胡风集团中的死硬的骨干分子，更应该给以最严厉的制裁！
    北京市海淀区第一中心小学教职员王兰蕙、沈忠、许文华等二十八人来信：“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，使我们认清了胡风集团是帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮的走狗。我们要求迅速逮捕胡风，依法给以严惩，并彻底追查胡风集团分子，分别给以适当处理，彻底肃清这个反革命集团。
    我们是小学教育工作者，从胡风事件中，我们认识到过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性。今后我们决心努力学习政治理论，提高政治觉悟，加强批评和自我批评，加强团结，为社会主义建设事业更好地贡献我们的力量。
    提高警惕，不让一切反革命分子有隙可乘
    海军战士周泉来信：读了胡风反革命集团的三批材料后，我们已清清楚楚地看到胡风反革命集团二十多年来的所作所为了。这批蒋介石的忠实走狗，一贯地打着革命的幌子，暗地里阴险恶毒地向革命进攻。但是，反革命分子的幻想是不会得逞的，在革命的人民面前，他们终于原形毕露了。我是一个人民海军的战士，胡风反革命集团的罪恶行为，激起我的无比的愤怒，我要求人民政府，给这批罪恶分子以最严厉的制裁。今天，我们人民海军和兄弟部队一道，兢兢业业地执行着祖国人民交给的光荣任务，保卫着我们的海防。而胡风分子却从各方面来破坏我们的革命事业，他们打进了我们的政府机关、教育机关、文化出版机关、……也混进了我们部队内部来，甚至有的已经钻进我们的党内来了。敌人是多么的毒辣呀！我们还能不提高警惕吗！我们要坚决地消灭他们。不管他们是如何地阴险毒辣，不管他们是在如何地煞费苦心，用什么“策略”，他们也是逃不出人民的巨掌的。
    北京钢铁工业学院分析化学教研组教员高慧、沈维同来信：读了“人民日报”发表的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”以后，我们对胡风分子的政治面貌看得更加清楚了。这批材料充分证明了胡风集团中的骨干都是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的反革命分子。原来，这些蒙面强盗很早以来就是蒋介石的忠实走狗，他们却伪装革命，长期潜伏在革命人民内部，打入党的组织，盗窃党内秘密文件，干着种种反革命的勾当。他们的手段是多么地卑鄙、毒辣、阴险、丑恶。现在，这些强盗的面纱算是被剥落了，他们的反革命嘴脸也完全露出来了。
    胡风集团中的反革命分子们，疯狂地仇恨着人民革命的胜利，他们把共产党所领导的人民革命力量认为是“枯黄的叶子”和“腐朽的尸体”，他们幻想着人民政权“呜呼完蛋”。殊不知他们自己以及他们所拥护的那个阶级才正是“腐朽的尸体”，他们是已经死亡了的蒋匪政权的幽灵。他们看不见人民的力量，真正要“呜呼完蛋”的正是他们自己，在中国共产党领导下的中国人民却是永远屹立着的。
    为了保卫我们人民革命的胜利成果，巩固人民民主政权，保卫祖国的社会主义建设，纯洁革命内部，我们请求政府对胡风反革命集团依法予以坚决的镇压，对于还在隐藏着的胡风分子必须进行严格的清理，决不放走一个。
    从胡风反革命集团事件的揭发，我们得到了一次深刻的教训。有着单纯技术观点的同志认为自己是搞科学工作的，只要多做些研究、实验就行，因而对政治不够关心，政治嗅觉非常迟钝，甚至天真地认为：经过轰轰烈烈的镇压反革命运动之后，已经不会再有反革命分子了。就是对胡风事件来说，最初也是不关心的，还以为只是一个思想问题。及至“人民日报”将有关胡风反革命集团的第二、三批材料发表后，大家才警觉起来，一致认识到如果再不很好地学习政治，提高自己的阶级警觉，就会成为这些反革命分子的物色对象，这是很危险的。今后我们一定要努力学习政治，提高自己的政治嗅觉，决不让反革命分子有空子可钻，这样才能够保证科学工作为社会主义事业服务。
    唐山市卫生防疫站杨树生来信：二十年来，胡风一贯地死心踏地进行反革命的罪恶活动，他是我们人民的死敌。对胡风反革命集团的斗争，是一个具有全民性的政治斗争。
    胡风和他的集团中的许多骨干分子，很早以前，就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，他们同美帝国主义和国民党特务机关有密切联系，长期地伪装革命，潜藏在人民内部，干着反革命的勾当。胡风集团骨干分子之一阿垅，是国民党的军官，他把人民革命力量看做是“脓”，认为“总是要排出”，并认为进攻人民革命力量必须坚决彻底，“一不做，二不休”！胡风集团对解放后的新社会，对人民革命政权，表现了刻骨的仇恨，他们说“对这个社会秩序，我憎恨”。他们诅咒人民革命政权的“灭亡”“完蛋”。胡风集团分子在密信中，把人民拥护中国共产党、拥护党的领导污蔑为“敬神”，污蔑我们的革命是“枯黄的叶子”、“腐朽的尸体”等。
    胡风这个反革命集团，是我国人民的死敌。我们一定要把这个反革命集团彻底消灭干净。我们揭发了胡风反革命集团的阴谋，给了这些反革命分子一个迎头痛击，这是党的胜利，是全国人民的胜利。我们要巩固胜利，把斗争进行到底，要坚决镇压胡风集团，彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团。我们必须记取这次教训，努力学习马克思列宁主义，时刻提高警惕性，把一切潜藏在革命队伍中的反革命暗害分子，彻底地连根消灭干净。
    北京大学西方语文系全体教职员来信：我们北京大学西方语文系全体教职员对于胡风反革命集团的罪行感到无比的愤怒。从“人民日报”公布的第三批材料里，我们更清楚地认识到，胡风集团绝不仅是思想反动的文艺集团，而是一个有组织有计划的反党、反人民、反革命的政治集团。这个集团的基本骨干都是旧中国最肮脏的渣滓，他们同国内外阶级敌人有着密切的联系。许多年来他们一直采取着恶毒、无耻的政治上两面派的手法，隐藏在革命队伍里，忠实地为帝国主义、国民党反动派服务。他们无孔不入，有机必乘。他们的罪恶、狂妄的野心是要颠覆人民的社会主义建设事业，企图使反动派暗无天日的统治复辟。一句话，它们是全中国人民最凶险的敌人，我们绝不能让他们的阴谋得逞，我们必须坚决彻底地粉碎这一反动集团。
    因此，我们要求政府对这帮反革命分子进行坚决的镇压；我们也要向那些尚未剥去假面具的胡风分子大喝一声：不许蒙混过关，必须据实交代。
    在这一场斗争里，我们深深感到自己必须加紧系统地、正规地学习马克思列宁主义，因为只有掌握了正确的立场、观点、方法，才能鉴别伪装的反动思想；我们也深深感到必须千百倍地加强革命警惕性，要善于辨别各式各样的反革命分子，把他们揭露出来，清除出去；同时，我们还认识到，必须努力克服工作和思想上的一切缺点，堵塞住任何可能被敌人利用的漏洞。只有这样，我们才能确保人民革命胜利的果实，才能使社会主义建设获得胜利。
    山西省专卖公司通讯组来信：我们是国营商业工作者，过去对文艺界的事情知道的不太多，尤其是对胡风这个人不了解。当我们看到“人民日报”接二连三发表的、揭发胡风集团罪恶的三批材料后，引起了我们全体职工无比的愤恨。胡风原来是一只披着羊皮的狼，混入到我们革命阵营里，进行反党、反人民、反革命的罪恶活动。我们公司的全体职工通过座谈，一致认识到胡风反动集团是一群最阴险的阶级敌人，原来他们是钻到我们的“肝脏里”来，进行反革命活动。过去我们有些同志认为，胡风仅是在文艺思想上有错误，同我们关系不大。现在看了，才大吃一惊，我们过去太麻痹了。
    最近报纸所公布的第三批材料，胡风反动集团的政治背景已完全弄清楚了。原来他的主子就是蒋介石。胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子，很早以前就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，他们的目的就是想颠覆我们的人民民主政权，使反动政权复辟。
    我们深深感到：必须提高阶级警觉性和政治敏感，再不能麻痹下去了。我们要求迅速把胡风反动集团首要分子逮捕法办。并彻底清除潜藏在各个角落的反革命分子。
    解放军战士谢伏生来信：我以无限愤恨的心情读了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料。彻头彻尾的反革命集团已经原形毕露了。原来胡风集团的骨干分子早就是蒋介石的忠实走狗，他们同帝国主义特务机关有着密切联系，长期地伪装革命，潜藏在人民内部，干着反革命勾当，这是多么狡猾，多么毒辣，多么阴险的反革命分子啊！
    二十多年来，他们隐藏在人民内部，干着反革命反人民的勾当。他们仇恨人民的革命力量，骂共产党和人民革命的力量为“万恶的共匪”，诅咒人民革命的政权“完蛋”“灭亡”，对蒋匪的“训话”大为“鼓舞”，认为中国人民解放军的“主力”“三个月可以击破”“一年肃清”；把人民革命力量看做是“脓”“总要排出”。原来胡风反革命集团是和蒋介石国民党，帝国主义分子一个鼻孔出气，穿着一个裤裆，走在一条路上，干着同样的反革命勾当。
    作为人民解放军一员的我，为了保卫祖国安全地进行社会主义建设，为了保卫人民革命斗争的胜利果实，巩固人民民主政权，我一定要永远握紧手中的枪，百倍地提高警惕；同时加强政治学习，提高自己的政治敏感，坚决彻底地粉碎破坏社会主义建设的敌人！
    我们知道敌人是不会甘心死亡的，是不会甘心让我们安心地进行社会主义建设的。这一次惊心动魄的斗争，就是我们的经验教训。但不管敌人怎样阴谋诡诈，伪装得如何巧妙，只要我们提高警惕，任何敌人都逃不出人民的法网的。
    我们一定要把隐藏在人民内部的一切反革命分子清除出去！我们一定要把他们粉碎干净！不获全胜，绝不休兵！
    首都人民英雄纪念碑设计处阮志大、萧传玖、张松鹤等二十三人来信：看了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，使我们更清楚地看到他们的反革命罪恶活动及其狰狞面貌。胡风很早就在江西“剿共”军中做政治工作，阿垅是蒋匪军中的军官，绿原曾在“中美合作所”“工作”。原来打着文艺工作者招牌的胡风集团，就是这些罪恶滔天的特务们组成的。我们看了这些材料，无不感到毛骨悚然。材料证明：胡风集团的骨干分子过去积极参加反人民的内战，早就同美帝国主义、国民党特务机关有密切联系。他们是蒋介石的忠实走狗，是和蒋贼共命运的人。全国解放后，胡风集团对中国人民革命的胜利怀着极强烈的仇恨和恐惧，不断地秘密地组织、策划、发动对党和人民的猖狂进攻。
    胡风集团，这股隐藏在革命队伍中的敌人是阴险、狡猾、恶毒的，因而对人民革命事业的危害性也是严重的。作为参加修建人民英雄纪念碑的建筑工作者和美术工作者的我们，对胡风反革命集团表示异常的愤慨。我们深切地感到中国人民革命事业的艰巨，千百万英雄烈士们以鲜血换来的今天的胜利果实，是神圣不可侵犯的。而胡风集团的阴谋，正是企图破坏和颠覆我们的人民民主政权，使蒋匪帮复辟。
    胡风集团，过去长期在文化界疯狂地散布反动思想，并无耻地歪曲党的文艺方针。资产阶级唯心主义、个人主义思想，在建筑、美术界并不是没有基础的，因此我们建筑工作者和美术工作者应该加强马克思列宁主义的学习，努力进行思想改造，从思想上肃清胡风的思想影响。
    我们一定要从胡风事件中吸取教训，百倍地提高警惕，我们坚决要求政府依法逮捕胡风及其集团中的骨干分子，并彻底肃清其反革命集团，不达完全胜利，决不休止。
    北京铁路管理局丰台建筑段刘兴国来信：我读了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，更清楚地认识了胡风集团的极端反动性和它的政治背景。
    我是一个铁路员工。起初见到批判胡风反动思想的文章时，只认为是文艺界在整顿文艺思想。关于胡风反革命集团的第一、第二、第三批材料的发表，惊醒了我们。我们再不能容忍这些反革命分子混在我们革命队伍中了。我们要吸取这次教训，加强政治理论学习，提高我们的革命警惕性，为彻底粉碎一切反革命阴谋而斗争。
    中国人民银行总行会计司杜志岳、杨国椿、邱文娟、郭维东来信：我们是银行的青年工作者。看了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，清楚地看见了他们的血淋淋的双手和狰狞的面貌，认清了他们是帝国主义蒋介石匪帮的忠实走狗。胡风反革命集团潜藏在人民内部，干着罪大恶极的反革命勾当。胡风集团是一群疯狂恶毒的反革命罪犯！
    我们没有理由沉默。阶级敌人对我们的胜利是不会甘心的。我们必须把这些丧心病狂的，潜伏在革命内部的反革命匪徒的老根挖掉。
      我们再也忍不住了，我们要把这一小撮毫无人性的特务，一网打尽。我们坚决要求：依法严惩胡风和胡风集团骨干分子。我们更要提高革命警惕性，坚决粉碎一切反革命敌人的阴谋活动。
    清华大学动力机械系汽车专业学生涂益韶来信：我是一个产业工人出身的学生，看了“人民日报”所揭发的反革命分子胡风及其集团的三批材料后，感到无比的愤怒。我们的党是光荣的、正确的、伟大的，我们热爱党、相信党、尊敬党更甚于自己的父母。只有在党的正确领导下，我们建成社会主义社会，劳苦大众才能获得最后的彻底的解放。
    然而，暗藏在我们队伍中的反革命分子胡风及其集团却在有组织有步骤地向党向革命展开恶毒的攻势，他们有反动的政治纲领和反革命的组织纪律，他们长期地用各种阴险毒辣的手段来破坏我们的革命事业。他们更恶毒地采取所谓“孙行者钻进肚皮去”的挖心战术，派遣他们的爪牙打入我们革命的内部和我们的党的组织中，以期对党对革命进行双面夹攻。
    胡风及其集团的反党反人民反革命的阴谋是和美蒋匪帮一致的，第三批材料也揭发了他们同国民党特务机关是早就有过密切联系的，无怪乎他们对于人民革命的胜利表现了强烈的仇恨和恐惧，无怪乎他们要千方百计地来破坏在人民群众中享有无限威信的我们的党了。
    现在反革命分子胡风及其集团像一条毒蛇一样赤裸裸地暴露在我们的面前，毒蛇必须消灭掉，用血肉换来的革命胜利果实，绝不允许受到破坏。反革命分子胡风及其集团必须受到人民法律的严厉制裁。
    胡风及其集团的反革命阴谋的揭露，使我深深地体会到马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争规律的学说的正确：当我们力量日益强大的时候，我们的敌人并不会因此而消沉，相反，他们会对我们更加仇恨，他们的反抗会更加疯狂，因而敌我的斗争会愈加尖锐和复杂。因此，我们要更加百倍地提高革命的警惕性，努力学习马克思列宁主义，提高自己的政治思想水平，提高自己的阶级觉悟，为人民、为祖国、为党的伟大事业而终身战斗。
    胡风反革命集团是各族人民的共同敌人
    民族出版社各族工作人员来信：我们民族出版社于六月十日举行了全体工作人员大会，声讨胡风反革命集团的罪行。在大会上，有汉、蒙、回、藏、维吾尔、哈萨克、朝鲜、锡伯等族干部二十多人发言，他们一致怀着极大的愤怒情绪，用各民族的语言，对胡风及胡风分子的反革命罪行，进行了声讨。我们一致认为，胡风反革命集团的阴谋是要破坏我们自由平等的民族大家庭。我们热爱祖国，热爱各民族共同的事业——社会主义事业；而胡风却梦想美蒋反动势力复辟，要使我们各族人民重新受苦受难，这是我们各族人民所决不容许的。第三批材料，更确凿地证明，胡风反革命集团是同美国帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的一群反革命分子。我们必须彻底粉碎胡风集团，把这批反革命分子从人民队伍中清除出去。同时，也要把类似胡风集团的一切暗藏的反革命分子，坚决地彻底地肃清。胡风和他们一伙比蛇还毒，比狼还凶狠，饶恕他们就是罪恶。我们要从胡风反革命集团的事件中吸取教训，提高警惕，加强团结，努力学习马克思列宁主义，更好地为人民服务。胡风反革命集团的被揭露，是各族人民革命事业中的重大胜利。我们要求彻底追查胡风反革命集团的罪行，对胡风及胡风集团分子按照法律给以应得的惩处。
    中央民族学院全体师生员工来信：我们看到“人民日报”发表的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”后，对于胡风和胡风反革命集团更感到无比的愤怒和痛恨！
    现在，已经以无可辩驳的证据，证明胡风和胡风反革命集团骨干分子，是长期潜伏在我们革命队伍中进行反革命活动的美蒋特务。
    他们很早就同美帝国主义和国民党特务机关有着联系，长期以来死心塌地地做美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的忠实走狗，阴险毒辣地对我们的革命事业进行破坏。他们梦想蒋介石匪帮的反动势力在中国复辟。他们是我们全国各族人民的死敌。
    我们建议全国人民代表大会常务委员会依法立即撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格。我们要求政府严惩胡风及其集团中的骨干分子。我们必须坚决地把一切反革命分子肃清，以巩固我们的人民民主政权。
    我们全国各族人民必须从胡风反革命事件中吸取严重教训，提高政治警惕性，揭发敌人反革命阴谋，对他们作坚决的斗争，紧密团结在中国共产党和毛泽东主席周围，为建设我们社会主义的伟大祖国而奋斗！
    云南省宾川县文化馆杨亚寗（民家族）来信：伪装了许多年的反革命分子胡风的本来面目被揭露了，这是祖国社会主义建设进程中的一次辉煌胜利。
    作为文化战线上的一个小兵——文化馆的馆员，我忍不住要提出我的要求，我主张撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会的代表资格，依法给以惩办。
    北京俄语学院僮族学生苏永勤来信：我是一个少数民族的学生。最近“人民日报”公布了关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，我每次拿到报纸后总是一口气把它看完，一次比一次地更加不能抑制心中的愤怒。
    暗藏在革命队伍中的、由帝国主义国民党特务分子、反动军官、托洛茨基分子、革命叛徒、自首变节分子所组成的胡风反革命集团骨干，今天终于被揭露出来，使各族人民都认识了这个反革命集团的凶恶狰狞的面目，这是一件大快人心的事，是革命事业的又一次胜利。
    这个反革命集团一贯采取两面派的策略，以
  “文艺”为幌子，干着反对共产党、反对人民革命事业的勾当。因为他们十分狡猾，善于伪装，学会了“阴暗的聪明”，学习了“几天马列主义”来反对马克思列宁主义，所以能够长期地迷惑很多人。千方百计地打入共产党内来，盗窃文件，当坐探，他们还想从内部来瓦解我们的党。但是只要我们提高警惕，敌人的任何阴谋是不能得逞的，迟早是要被揭破的。
    对待反革命的宽大，就是对人民的残忍。镇压反革命必须狠，“一不做，二不休”。我要求严惩胡风反革命集团，决不容许反革命分子再“滑过去了”。
