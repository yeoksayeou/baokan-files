Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 10th: Agence France-Presse reported that the secretariat of the World Peace Council Chairman Joliot-Curie released an open letter to American citizens. This letter was jointly signed by Édouard Herriot, Honorary President of the French National Assembly, Ms Soong Ching-ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, British physicist Bernal, Fadeev, representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Nenni, a member of the Italian Parliament, and German Pastor Niemöller.

The letter stated: "All of humanity today is filled with excited hope for the upcoming talks between representatives of the major powers. However, talks between government representatives alone are not enough. There should also be other talks, talks between representatives of the public, talks between people of different lifestyles, to discuss relations between the peoples of all countries to promote the efforts made by governments. The conference to be held in Helsinki from June 22nd to 29th, attended by representatives from seventy-five countries, is this kind of meeting.

"We earnestly hope that representatives of the American people will join us in this conference. It would be truly regrettable if this great nation were not represented at such an important conference. Unrestricted and free discussion will help to seek the path towards world peace."

    赫里欧、宋庆龄、贝尔纳、法捷耶夫等人联名写信给美国公民
    希望美国人民派遣代表参加世界和平大会
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社巴黎十日讯：法新社报道，世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的秘书处发表了一封给美国公民的公开信。这封信是由法国国民议会荣誉议长赫里欧、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄女士、英国物理学家贝尔纳、苏联最高苏维埃代表法捷耶夫、意大利议会议员南尼、德国尼穆勒神甫联合签名发出的。
    这封信写道：“全人类今天都对大国代表会谈的即将到来怀着兴奋的希望。但是，仅是政府代表会谈是不够的。应当还有其他的会谈，举行公众代表的会谈，各种不同生活方式的人的会谈，来讨论各国人民之间的关系问题，以促进政府所作的努力。七十五个国家的代表将从六月二十二日到二十九日在赫尔辛基举行的大会就是这种会议。
    “我们热烈希望，美国人民的代表将同我们一道参加这次大会。如果这一伟大的民族没有代表出席如此重要的这次大会，那将真正是一件十分可憾的事。无所不谈的和自由的讨论将有助于寻求走向世界和平的道路。”
