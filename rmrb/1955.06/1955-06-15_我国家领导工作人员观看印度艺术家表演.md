    新华社十四日讯　中华人民共和国国家领导工作人员和各部门负责人，十四日晚间在中南海怀仁堂观看了印度艺术家们的音乐歌舞表演。各国驻华使节和外交官员也出席观看表演。
    引人入胜的艺术表演，受到了极大欢迎。在辉煌的大厅里，时时响起暴风雨般的掌声。
    八时，我国家领导工作人员刘少奇、周恩来、林伯渠、沈钧儒、郭沫若、彭真、彭德怀、陈毅、李富春、李先念等和钱达先生和夫人及印度驻华大使赖嘉文走进会场。这时，全场响起了经久不息的掌声。
    今晚印度艺术家们共表演了十二个音乐歌舞节目。这些节目再一次向中国人民显示了印度艺术的光辉传统和卓越成就。
    管弦乐合奏是用印度民族乐器演奏的一支印度古曲，旋律悦耳。锡达尔的演奏者阿·哈·贾·康恩，以高度的技巧和丰富的感情，演奏出对大自然的赞美和对明媚的春天的歌颂。
    著名舞蹈家印·拉赫曼女士表演了两个婆罗多舞，她以优美的舞姿在前一个节目表现了欢愉的情绪，在后一个节目中表现了吉卜赛女子的豪放的性格。阿·古哈女士今晚再度表演了为观众所喜爱的卡塔克舞。小巴蕾舞剧团表演的民间舞，在观众面前呈现了印度南部兰巴第妇女的柔和妩媚。
    人们热烈欢迎印度著名舞蹈家克·库蒂和希·瓦吉弗达尔表演的卡达卡利舞。库蒂用多变的手势，丰富的面部表情和多样的舞姿，为观众表演了国王、一个人、一个女人、海的波浪、地狱、天堂、花园等不同的形象以及面部的控制和惊喜、厌恶、恐惧等不同的情绪。他在观众长时间的掌声中再三谢幕。瓦吉弗达尔表演的幽雅的女子舞蹈“纱里舞”也受到极为热烈的欢迎。
    最后一个节目，表演了“智慧生活的艺术”。这是一个把巴蕾舞、歌曲和戏剧溶合为一的歌舞剧。它以寓言的形式歌颂了伟大的友谊。演出结束后，中国青年文艺工作者向钱达团长和夫人及印度艺术家们献花表示感谢。
    演出结束以后，周恩来总理和郭沫若副委员长曾到后台向印度艺术家们一一握手致谢，有的印度艺术家请周恩来总理签名留念。在告别时，周恩来总理用印度语祝贵宾们晚安。
