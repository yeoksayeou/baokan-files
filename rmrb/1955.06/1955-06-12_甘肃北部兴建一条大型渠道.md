    A large canal being built on the Yellow River Plain near Yinchuan in northern Gansu Province has entered its final construction stage. More than 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork, out of the 500,000 cubic meters planned for this year, have been completed; six of the twenty-two buildings have also been completed. It is expected that the entire project will be completed by the end of July this year. After the completion of this canal, it can irrigate 400,000 mu of farmland. The irrigated area of farmland on the Yellow River Plain in northern Gansu Province will reach 86.9% of the total existing river terrace farmland area of the entire plain.
    The construction of this canal, which is 83.5 kilometers long, started in 1953 with state investment. The canal will have an intake sluice and twenty-nine diversion gates, all equipped with hoists. The canal flows south along the Helan Mountains, passing through the three counties of Huinong, Pingluo, and Helan in the Yinchuan Special District. Farmers and state-owned farms along the canal can all draw water from the canal for irrigation.

    甘肃北部兴建一条大型渠道
    在甘肃省北部银川附近黄河平原上兴建的一条大型渠道已进入最后施工阶段。今年要做的五十万公方的土方工程现已完成三十多万公方；二十二座建筑物也完成六座。预计今年七月底，全部工程可以完工。这条渠道修成后，可以灌溉四十万亩农田。甘肃省北部黄河平原的农田灌溉面积将达到整个平原现有全部川地农田面积的百分之八十六点九。
    这条渠道是一九五三年开始由国家投资兴建的。渠道全长八十三点五公里。渠道上要建筑进水闸和二十九个斗门，并全部设置启闭机。渠道沿贺兰山南流，经过银川专区的惠农、平罗、贺兰三县。沿岸的农民和国营农场都可以引渠水灌溉。
