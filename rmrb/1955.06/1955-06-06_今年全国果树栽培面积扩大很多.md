This Year, the National Fruit Tree Cultivation Area Has Expanded Greatly

    Since the beginning of spring this year, fruit tree production has seen new development throughout the country. Liaoning, Shandong, Rehe, Hebei and other provinces will plant nearly ten million apple trees this year; the citrus tree cultivation area in Guangdong, Sichuan and other provinces will expand by more than 60,000 mu. The broad masses of farmers are highly motivated to develop fruit tree production. This year, the proportion of fruit trees planted by production cooperatives has increased significantly compared with previous years, and most of these fruit trees are planted in continuous tracts. Before planting fruit trees, various places held short-term training courses to train a large number of technical personnel for planting fruit trees and contour surveyors for mountainous areas, and strengthened the organization of seedling packaging and transportation, so the quality of fruit tree planting has been significantly improved, and the survival rate is generally good.

    Various regions have strengthened the management of existing orchards. Key fruit producing areas in Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces have carried out work such as cleaning orchards, applying pesticides to control pests, fertilizing, and pruning. This year, fruit trees are growing well in various places. It is estimated that the output of pears and apples in Hebei, Liaoning, Rehe and other provinces will exceed last year. At present, Hainan Island's fruits have had a bumper harvest. The island's pineapple production is about 120,000 dan, an increase of more than 10% compared with last year, and the output of lychees and longans is estimated to be several times higher than last year.

    今年全国果树栽培面积扩大很多
    今春以来全国各地果树生产有了新的发展。辽宁、山东、热河、河北等省今年将栽植苹果树近一千万株；广东、四川等省的柑桔树栽培面积将扩大六万余亩。广大农民发展果树生产的积极性很高。今年，生产合作社栽植果树的比重比往年有显著增加，这些果树大部分是连片栽植的。各地在果树栽植前举办了短期训练班，培养了大批栽植果树的技术手和山地等高测量员，并加强了苗木包装起运的组织工作，因而果树栽植的质量显著提高，成活情况一般良好。
    各地对原有果园加强了管理。辽宁、河北、山东、广东、浙江、江西、福建等省的果树重点产区，都进行了清洁果园、施药治虫、施肥、修剪等工作。今年各地果树生长情况良好，估计河北、辽宁、热河等省梨、苹果的产量都将超过去年。现在，海南岛的水果已获丰收，全岛菠萝产量约有十二万担，比去年增产一成多，荔枝、龙眼的产量约比去年增加数倍。（柯宁白）
