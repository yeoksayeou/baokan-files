    The publication of the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has aroused even greater anger among the broad masses of the people towards the counter-revolutionary elements. From June 10th to June 24th, a period of fifteen days, this newspaper received over 5,200 articles and letters from readers across the country and from all walks of life, denouncing the crimes of the Hu Feng clique. Many letters from various organizations were written in the name of all staff members, and many others were co-signed by dozens or even hundreds of people. The writers included people from all strata of society: workers, technicians, and management personnel from factories, mines, enterprises, and basic construction sites; staff members from various government agencies and organizations; soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army; public security personnel; revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers; faculty and students from universities, middle schools, and primary schools; rural work cadres; staff members from state-owned farms and members of agricultural production cooperatives; members of various democratic parties; people from industry and commerce and religious circles; handicraftsmen; shop assistants; health workers; journalists; literary and art workers; people of minority nationalities; returned overseas Chinese; and family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, housewives, Young Pioneers, and so on.
    The broad masses of readers expressed unparalleled anger at the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and unanimously demanded that the government resolutely suppress this counter-revolutionary gang and give them the punishment they deserve. At the same time, they expressed their determination to learn from the Hu Feng incident, raise their revolutionary vigilance and political sensitivity, learn to identify hidden enemies, and fight to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Volunteer soldier Wei Jiaqi wrote from his post in Korea: "We are not Mr. Dongguo, and we must not show mercy to man-eating wolves." Chen Haiying, a staff member of the Kaifeng branch of the China Food Company, wrote: "I was transferred from the army to a commercial work post. The leadership asked me to also serve as the head of the administrative confidentiality group, and I always felt it was an extra burden. I mistakenly believed that since the mainland of the country had been liberated, not many enemies would dare to attack us. The Hu Feng incident greatly educated me. I guarantee to improve my political awareness and class vigilance in the future, do my job well, and strictly prevent the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements." Ma Ronghai, a People's Representative of Chongwen District, Beijing, and an Imam of Islam, wrote: "We must unite around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, smash all the conspiracies of hidden enemies, and strive to defend and build our great motherland."
