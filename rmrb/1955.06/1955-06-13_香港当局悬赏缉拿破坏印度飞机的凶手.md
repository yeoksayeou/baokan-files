Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 12th: A Hong Kong dispatch: The Hong Kong British Government Information Services issued a special communiqué at 1:00 PM on June 12th, stating:

"A reward of HK$100,000 will be given by the Hong Kong Commissioner of Police to anyone who can provide information leading to the arrest and conviction of any individual or group responsible for the sabotage of the Indian International Airlines 'Kashmir Princess' aircraft, which crashed into the sea en route from Hong Kong to Jakarta on April 11, 1955."

On the morning of the 13th, all major newspapers in Hong Kong will publish the police's reward notice in their advertising columns.

Commissioner of Police Maxwell said on the 12th: "It has been undoubtedly confirmed that the 'Kashmir Princess' crashed due to the explosion of some kind of time bomb. Regrettably, it is almost equally certain that this time bomb was placed on the plane in Hong Kong."

The Commissioner of Police continued: "We will spare no effort to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime, intolerable to the conscience of all mankind, to justice.

"The Hong Kong Police are treating this case as a meticulously planned mass murder. All the investigations we have been patiently and continuously conducting since we first heard of the plane crash illustrate that this is how we are handling the case.

"We have now reached the stage where we must ask the public to help us complete our investigation. We believe that among the residents of Hong Kong, there must be someone who, if they come forward, can assist the police authorities in their investigation.

"Therefore, I urge anyone who believes they have any information – no matter how trivial or unimportant it may seem – that can provide proof of the commission of this heinous crime, to make this information available to the police authorities.

"Private letters addressed to myself or to Mr. K. Wilcox, Head of the Special Police Department, will be kept completely confidential. Letters can be sent to my private mailbox, Hong Kong No. 2142, or information can of course be provided through any police officer, or by telephone to the Hong Kong or Kowloon headquarters."

    香港当局悬赏缉拿破坏印度飞机的凶手
    新华社广州十二日电　香港消息：香港英国政府新闻处六月十二日下午一点发表了一项特别公报说：
    “如果有人能提供情报，因而能导致对一九五五年四月十一日从香港飞往雅加达的途中坠入海中的印度国际航空公司的‘克什米尔公主号’飞机进行破坏工作的某一个人或一批人加以逮捕和定罪，香港警务处长将给他十万元港币赏金。”
    十三日上午，香港各主要报纸都将在广告栏中刊登警察方面的悬赏通告。
    警务处长马克斯威尔十二日说：“已经毫无疑问地证实，‘克什米尔公主号’是由于某种定时炸弹的爆炸而坠毁的。令人遗憾的是，几乎可以同样肯定这个定时炸弹是在香港放到飞机上去的。”
    警务处长接着说：“我们不遗余力地要使这个为全人类的良知所不能容忍的险恶罪行的凶手受到法律制裁。
    “香港警察正在把这个案件当作经过周密布置的大规模谋杀案来处理。我们自从一听到飞机失事的消息就一直耐心地和不断地进行的一切调查，就说明了我们是这样处理这一案件的。
    “我们现在已经到达这样的阶段：我们必须要求公众帮助我们完成我们的调查工作。我们相信香港的居民当中，只要他们挺身而出，一定有人能帮助警察当局进行调查。
    “因此我要求任何人只要他认为他有任何情报——不管看来如何微不足道或不重要——可以提供来证明这个可恶的罪行的实施，就让警察当局得到这种情报。
    “寄给我自己或寄给特设警务部主任克·维尔科克斯先生的私人信件将完全保守机密。来信可投寄我的私人邮箱、香港第二千一百四十二号，当然也可以通过任何警察官员提供情报，或者用电话通知香港或九龙总部。”
