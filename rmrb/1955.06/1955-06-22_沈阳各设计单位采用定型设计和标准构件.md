Shenyang – Design units in Shenyang are adopting standard designs and standard components.

    The Shenyang Branch of the Non-Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Shenyang Design Third and Fourth Branches of the Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, along with eight other design units, are currently strengthening their standard design work. As of June 10th, they have collectively compiled and exchanged over 400 existing standard designs, standard components, and reusable design projects.

    Currently, in the drawings produced by the Electrical and Power and other four groups of the Shenyang Design Third Branch of the Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, those employing standard drawings or making minor revisions to standard drawings account for approximately 56% of all drawings. This bureau has saved 1,200 design workdays by extensively adopting standard designs and standard components. The Shenyang Design Fourth Branch of the Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, in designing a project, adopted a standardized power supply technical design, increasing efficiency by 50%. When designing staff and worker dormitories in Anshan, the Shenyang Branch of the Non-Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry adopted prefabricated reinforced concrete components and advanced construction methods, reducing costs by approximately 39% for the civil construction portion alone compared to the standard staff and worker dormitories designed in 1954. Currently, the various units have jointly established a committee specializing in overseeing standard design work.

    沈阳各设计单位采用定型设计和标准构件
    重工业部有色冶金设计院沈阳分院，第一机械工业部设计总局沈阳设计三、四分局，和沈阳煤矿设计院等八个设计单位，现在正进行加强标准设计工作，到六月十日止，共整理和交换了四百多项已有的定型设计、标准构件和可供重复使用的设计项目。
    第一机械工业部设计总局沈阳设计三分局的电气、动力等四个组，目前在他们绘制的图纸中，采用标准图纸或采用标准图纸进行小修的，就占全部图纸的百分之五十六左右。这个局从大量采用定型设计和标准构件中，节省了一千二百个设计工日。第一机械工业部设计总局沈阳设计四分局在设计一项工程中，采用了定型的供电技术设计，效率提高百分之五十。重工业部有色冶金设计院沈阳分院在设计鞍山职工家属宿舍时，采用了钢筋混凝土预制构件和先进的施工方法，仅土建部分就比一九五四年设计的职工标准宿舍降低成本百分之三十九左右。目前各单位联合成立了一个专门掌握标准设计工作的委员会。（本报集体通讯员沈阳日报编辑部）
