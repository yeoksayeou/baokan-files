Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: According to TASS, Indian Prime Minister Nehru and his party, after visiting the Altai reclaimed areas and Magnitogorsk for two consecutive days, arrived in Sverdlovsk, a famous industrial city in the Urals, on the 17th. Indian journalists currently visiting the Soviet Union also accompanied them.

Nehru and his party left Tashkent on the morning of the 16th and flew to Rubtsovsk in the Altai Krai, stopping for a while in Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh Republic, en route. In the afternoon, the plane landed at Rubtsovsk Airport to the sound of welcoming crowds. After disembarking, Prime Minister Nehru said: I have heard a lot about the Soviet Union's plans to reclaim wasteland. There is something to be learned here. Nehru and his party then visited the "Kulinsk" state grain farm.

On the 17th, Nehru and his party arrived in Magnitogorsk. The streets of the city were lined with banners welcoming Prime Minister Nehru, and crowds lined the streets to welcome the Indian guests. Nehru and his entourage spent several hours visiting the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine, the largest metallurgical plant in Europe. At the Magnet Mountain mine, Prime Minister Nehru received a small box of various local minerals from the miners. Nehru spent a long time visiting the No. 8 blast furnace, equipped with the latest Soviet technology, and watched the iron being tapped. The blast furnace workers presented Prime Minister Nehru with a statue of himself cast from local pig iron. As Prime Minister Nehru returned to the airport to fly to Sverdlovsk, the metallurgical workers presented the guests with three metal sculptures: a statue of Gandhi for Nehru, a statue of Nehru for Nehru's daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, and a statue of "Friendship of All Nations" for the Indian people. The children of the metallurgical workers also presented Nehru with a wooden-branded statue of Nehru and a panoramic view of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine. When saying goodbye to the people of Magnitogorsk, the Indian Prime Minister warmly extended greetings of friendship to them on behalf of the Indian people.

    尼赫鲁等十六日晨离塔什干飞往阿尔泰边疆区的鲁布佐夫斯克，途中，在哈萨克共和国首都阿拉木图逗留了一段时间。下午，飞机在人群的欢迎声中在鲁布佐夫斯克机场降落。尼赫鲁总理下机后发表谈话说：我听到过很多关于苏联开垦荒地的计划。这里有东西可资学习。尼赫鲁等随即参观了“库林斯克”国营谷物农场。
    十七日，尼赫鲁等到达马格尼托哥尔斯克。这个城市的街道上到处挂着欢迎尼赫鲁总理的横幅标语，人群夹道欢迎印度来宾。尼赫鲁和随员用了几小时的时间参观了欧洲最大的冶金工厂——马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金联合工厂。在磁铁山采矿场上，尼赫鲁总理接受了矿工们送的一小箱当地产的各种矿物。尼赫鲁在以最新的苏联技术装备起来的第八号高炉参观了很久，并观看了出铁的情况。高炉工人送给了尼赫鲁总理一个用这里的生铁浇铸的他本人的像。在尼赫鲁总理转回到飞机场准备飞往斯维德洛夫斯克时，冶金工人们又赠送给来宾们三个金属雕刻品：送给尼赫鲁的是甘地像，送给尼赫鲁的女儿英迪拉·甘地夫人的是尼赫鲁像，送给印度人民的是“各国人民的友谊”像。冶金工人的孩子们还送给尼赫鲁一座用木头烙成的尼赫鲁像和一幅马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金联合工厂的全景图。印度总理在同马格尼托哥尔斯克人告别时，热情地代表印度人民向他们致友谊的问候。
