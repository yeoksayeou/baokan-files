    The reorganization work of the directly affiliated organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has come to an end. The preliminary plan is to reduce more than 47 percent of the original staff, close to half.
    The reorganization plan for the directly affiliated organs of the CPC Central Committee has been formulated, with the exception of a few units. When formulating the plans, each organ generally proceeded from its specific situation. Therefore, some organs reduced more, some reduced less, and individual organs even increased personnel. For example, the units under the General Office of the CPC Central Committee initially planned to reduce more than 60 percent of the original number of personnel; the various ministries and commissions of the CPC Central Committee, such as the Organization Department of the Central Committee and the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, planned to reduce the original number of personnel by an average of nearly half; the Compilation and Translation Bureau of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin's Works of the CPC Central Committee and other units reduced very little or basically did not reduce due to work needs; the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC Central Committee is a newly established institution, and the current manpower is not compatible with the work tasks, and some personnel have been added.
    The reorganization work of the directly affiliated organs of the CPC Central Committee generally starts with studying the business, clarifying responsibilities and work methods, and then considering the organization and determining the staffing. The leading staff of many departments attach great importance to this work, and can personally analyze and study the actual situation and specific problems of their own units; and mobilize the masses or activists to conduct in-depth discussions. The leaders of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee have a strong determination to implement the central government's reorganization policy, and repeatedly explained the great significance of the reorganization work to the heads of its subordinate units, dispelling the resistant thoughts of some staff; and worked with the heads of various units to specifically calculate work tasks, and study what kind of institutions should be set up and how many people are needed. Some bureaus of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee did not mobilize the masses well at the beginning, and did not carefully study the business, so they formulated a plan to reduce more than 46 percent of the original staff, but many people disagreed and raised many opinions; later, after the leaders of the bureau re-mobilized and further mobilized the masses to conduct in-depth research, the number of people reduced was increased to more than 60 percent of the original staff.

### 中共中央直属机关整编工作告一段落

    中共中央直属机关整编工作告一段落
    中国共产党中央直属机关的整编工作已告一段落，初步计划从原编制工作人员中，减少百分之四十七以上，接近一半。
    中共中央直属机关的整编方案，除个别单位外，都已制定出来。各机关在制定方案时，一般都从各机关的具体情况出发，因此，有的机关减得多，有的机关减得少，个别机关还增加了人。如中共中央办公厅所属单位初步计划减少原编制人数的百分之六十以上；中共中央各部委，如中央组织部、中央宣传部等单位，计划平均减少原编制人数的将近一半；中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局等单位，由于工作需要，减得很少或基本上不减；中共中央监察委员会是个新成立的机构，现有人力和工作任务不相适应，还增加了一些人员。
    中共中央直属各机关的整编工作，一般都是先研究业务，明确职责和工作方法，然后考虑机构和确定人员编制。许多部门的领导工作人员都很重视这一工作，能亲自动手分析研究本单位的实际情况和具体问题；并发动群众或活动分子深入讨论。中共中央农村工作部领导人，贯彻中央整编方针的决心很大，向所属各单位的负责人反复说明整编工作的重大意义，打通某些工作人员的抵触思想；并和各单位负责人一道具体计算工作任务，研究要设什么机构，要多少人。中共中央办公厅有的局，开始时没有很好发动群众，没有仔细研究业务，就制定出从原编制人员中减少百分之四十六以上的方案，可是很多人不同意，提出很多意见；后来经过局的领导人重新作了动员，进一步发动群众，深入研究，结果减少的人数提高到占原编制人数的百分之六十以上。（新华社）
