    Seventy-Five Nations Will Send Representatives to the World Peace Assembly
    (By our Vienna correspondent) The majority of countries around the world are victoriously preparing for the World Peace Assembly, to be held in Helsinki from June 22nd to 29th. It is now known that seventy-five countries will send representatives to this important meeting. Prominent politicians, scientists, artists, and representatives from international organizations such as the United Nations Associations, and trade union organizations of various persuasions have decided to attend the assembly.
    The recent series of meetings of peace defenders in many countries has shown that broad sectors in various countries understand that, although the current international situation has eased somewhat, the danger of atomic war still seriously threatens their future. At these meetings, representatives not only welcomed the convening of the World Peace Assembly but also expressed their willingness to fight with greater strength to safeguard peace and their national security.
    The strong response caused by the convening of the World Peace Assembly is also reflected in the fact that the committee participating in the Japanese delegation to the Helsinki World Peace Assembly includes, in addition to many well-known figures, forty organizations of various persuasions: the Railway Workers' Union with 400,000 members, the Miners' Union with 270,000 members, the Bank Employees' Union with 157,000 members, the Education Workers' Union with 536,000 members, the Japan Farmers' Association, the Japan Cultural Persons Assembly, the Japan National Student Federation, and many other organizations. The French delegation will be a very large delegation, with Herriot as honorary head, and will include parliamentarians of various political persuasions, former ministers, artists, trade union leaders, etc. The composition of the Indian delegation, the Italian delegation, the Arab countries delegation, etc., is also very broad.
  Indonesia Holds National Peace Conference
    The Indonesian National Peace Conference concluded in Jakarta on the 13th. The conference elected a delegation headed by Professor Poerbodiningrat, chairman of the Indonesian Peace Committee, to attend the World Peace Assembly to be held in Helsinki.
    The conference issued a letter to the Indonesian people and passed resolutions on national independence and defense of peace, on military alliances, collective security and international cooperation, and on atomic weapons and disarmament. The conference also passed resolutions on a number of basic political and cultural issues.
    The resolution on national independence and defense of peace expressed support for the ten principles adopted by the Asian-African Conference, especially the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
    The resolution on military alliances, collective security and international cooperation condemned military alliances as actions hostile to other countries, hindering international relations and leading to war.
    The resolution on atomic weapons and disarmament considered the use of atomic weapons a crime against humanity and the propaganda and preparation for atomic war a crime against peace.
  Mongolia Holds National Conference for the Defense of Peace
    The National Conference for the Defense of Peace of the Mongolian People's Republic was held in Ulaanbaatar on the 7th.
