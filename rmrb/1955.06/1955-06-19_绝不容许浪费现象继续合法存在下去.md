To the Editor:

    In response to the Party's call for practicing strict economy and to be responsible for state property, I am exposing the serious waste phenomenon existing at the Tianjin Wire Factory, which is under the First Ministry of Machine Building, to the Party newspaper.

    In the past year or two, although the Tianjin Wire Factory has overfulfilled the state's assigned tasks in terms of total output value and profits delivered to the state, serious waste has been caused due to poor enterprise management and a lack of a high sense of responsibility towards state property on the part of the leaders. In 1954, due to the poor quality of products, 69 tons of waste products were generated from enameled wire, copper wire, and steel wire. The loss from raw material waste reached 300,000 yuan (of which the net loss was 210,000 yuan). This serious scrapping phenomenon is still occurring constantly. In the first quarter of this year, more than five tons of copper wire have already been scrapped. Currently, the average weekly scrap of copper wire is still around 200 kilograms. In addition, the waste of auxiliary materials is also very serious. The remaining scraps (including copper wire, steel wire, and lead wire) from the workshop production process are mixed together, losing their value. Waste copper wire and lead wire can be seen everywhere in the factory yard. In some places, copper wire can still be found a meter deep. Some workers say, "In a few years, the factory will become a copper mine!" The yarn wrapping machine in the Third Workshop wastes 120 kilograms of motor oil every month. In the First Workshop, the waste tin soil dumped in the yard has piled up into a small hill. In March, workers from the Mechanical Department used their spare time to extract five tons of tin from some of the tin soil. The workers could not bear to see a large amount of property being lost, so they consciously launched voluntary labor to pick up waste materials. On the morning of May 8th, they picked up more than 13 tons of copper wire, steel wire, lead wire, and various materials from the yard.

    Why can't the waste phenomenon be eliminated? This is inseparable from the leadership's thinking. In October 1954, a production accident occurred in the factory, resulting in a large number of waste products. At that time, I raised my opinion to the Deputy Director of Production, Mu Tu, but he believed: "The factory makes a lot of money, so wasting a little doesn't matter," and "Wasting a little is inevitable." Two years ago, Comrade He Yunting, the Party Branch Secretary who had been constantly raising the issue of preventing waste to the factory director, now also says: "After seeing too much, I've become accustomed to it and no longer find it strange." Therefore, in our factory, wasteful behavior has almost become legal.

    Regarding the waste phenomenon existing in our factory, the Tianjin Daily has made public criticisms twice, but some leading staff members of our factory remain indifferent. I suggest that the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government and the Tianjin Municipal Committee conduct a serious inspection to resolutely stop this waste phenomenon.

    绝不容许浪费现象继续合法存在下去编辑同志：
    为响应党的厉行节约的号召，为对国家财产负责，我向党报揭发第一机械工业部所属天津电线厂存在的严重浪费现象。
    近一两年来，天津电线厂在总产值和上缴利润方面，虽然都超额完成国家所给予的任务，但是由于企业经营管理不善，领导人对国家财产缺乏高度的责任心，造成了严重的浪费现象。一九五四年由于产品质量低劣，漆包线、铜线、钢线三种产品的废品就有六十九吨。原材料浪费的损失达到三十万元（其中净损为二十一万元）。这种严重报废的现象，到现在仍在不断发生。今年第一季度报废的铜线又已超过五吨。目前每周报废的铜线平均仍在二百公斤左右。此外，浪费辅助材料的情况，也很严重。车间生产过程中余下的边料（包括铜线、钢线、铅线）由于混淆在一起，失去了使用价值。工厂院内，到处都可以看见废铜线和铅线。有的地方，挖下一公尺深还能发现铜线。有的工人说：“再过几年，工厂就会变成铜矿了！”第三车间的纱包机每月浪费马达机油达一百二十公斤。第一车间倒在院里的锡土已堆成了小山。三月份，机动科工人利用业余时间，从一部分锡土中，就提炼出五吨锡来。工人们不忍看到大批财产受到损失，他们自觉地发起拣废料的义务劳动。五月八日一个上午，就从院里拣到铜线、钢线、铅线和各种物资十三吨多。
    为什么浪费现象总是消除不了呢？这是同领导思想分不开的。一九五四年十月，厂里发生了生产事故，造成大量废品。当时，我曾向生产副厂长穆图提过意见，但是他认为：“工厂很赚钱，浪费点算不了什么”“浪费点也是很难免的。”两年以前，曾向厂长不断提出防止浪费问题的党总支书记何云亭同志现在也说：“事情看多了，也就习以为常，见怪不怪了。”因此，在我们厂里，浪费行为，几乎成为合法的了。
    对于我们厂里存在的浪费现象，天津日报虽曾两次提出公开批评，但是我们工厂的某些领导工作人员却无动于衷。我建议中央第一机械工业部和天津市委来进行认真的检查，坚决制止这种浪费现象。第一机械工业部天津电线厂  监察室副主任  苏更
