    I Love the Northwest Geological Department of the Motherland
    Yan Jinan, Engineer and Deputy Captain of the Qilian Mountains General Survey Brigade, Northwest Geological Bureau
    In the spring of 1952, when I was still working at the Mineral Geology Exploration Bureau of the China Geological Work Steering Committee in Nanjing, I was transferred by my superiors to the Northwest to participate in the exploration of a metal deposit. I was very happy to hear that it was to explore a metal deposit; but a strange sense of worry also arose at the same time. I was concerned that life in the Northwest would be difficult and transportation would be challenging. At the same time, my wife was several months pregnant and needed care. These concerns even made me waver. Later, I thought that I was a young technician and a geological worker, and I should go to the forefront of the country's industrial construction. A difficult position is a glorious position, and a difficult place is a furnace for tempering oneself; the organization will take care of family issues. After some ideological struggle, I resolutely took the train to the Northwest of the motherland.
    After arriving in the Northwest, the first problem I encountered was eating. I mostly ate rice when I worked in the South. When we first arrived in the Northwest mountains, we mostly ate steamed buns and noodles, which we were not used to at first. But when I thought of Chairman Mao leading the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army over the snow-capped mountains and grasslands, eating grass roots and tree bark, I felt that this was nothing to suffer. After a few days, I naturally got used to it. Now I can eat several large steamed buns in one meal. I am particularly interested in the beef and mutton here. The beef and mutton here are tender and delicious, without so much of a fishy smell. In March 1955, I returned to Shanghai to see my wife and children. The first thing my wife said to me was, "I thought you would be burnt in the Northwest, but who knew you would be much stronger than when you left Nanjing."
    Before we came to the Northwest, we had also heard some sensational rumors. It was said that the Northwest was windy all year round, and when the wind blew, "sand and stones would fly, the sun would be blocked, trees would be uprooted, and houses would be blown down," and so on. But where is there anything so terrible! When we arrived in the Gobi Desert, we also encountered the biggest sandstorm weather, commonly known as "black wind". But the black wind is not so terrible, and there are not so many of them. A few times in the spring is considered a lot. When the wind comes, we avoid it in the house or tent, and it passes in a while, and then it is good weather with sunshine and warmth again. When we arrived in the Qilian Mountains, there are majestic mountains, verdant trees, fresh air, and gurgling streams. You can't see sandstorms even if you want to.
    I am a member of the geological exploration team, and the places we go to are all remote mountains and wildernesses. In those deep mountains, we often come into contact with hardworking and simple ethnic compatriots. Their sincere assistance and enthusiastic support deeply moved us and made us love our work even more. Once, we worked in a place for a whole day without finding water to drink, and the comrades were a little upset. At this time, we saw an old man in his fifties or sixties herding sheep on the mountain. We waved and called to him. After he understood what we meant, he brought us a jar of spring water that he had stored. The comrades drank the water in one gulp. This old man seemed tireless, and regardless of his flock of sheep, he ran into the mountain with the jar as if flying. After an hour or two, he brought us back a lot of sweet water and helped us boil it to drink. He stood aside, watching our greedy look with satisfaction, and smiled slightly. He looked at the various sample stones placed in front of us and told us what kind of identical and strange stones were on every mountain within a few dozen miles. We thanked him, and he replied, "You are here to find treasures for the country and to bring us good fortune. What is it to help you?" The words of this old man moved me to tears at that time.
      Many Tibetans also live in the Qilian Mountains. They are kind, honest, and enthusiastically assist us in our work. One of our detachments was once trapped in the deep valley of a snow mountain, and vegetables and meat were not supplied for a long time. The local Tibetan hunters drilled into the mountains, hunted deer and yellow sheep, and sent them to us to eat. When working in the Ejina Banner area, we rode camels and traveled all over the Gobi Desert. When the Mongolian compatriots heard that we were people sent by Chairman Mao to find mines, they would rather endure hunger and thirst themselves than give us the water and dry food they carried with them. Sometimes they would very warmly and firmly pull us into their yurts to drink and eat.
    I love the great Northwest of the motherland, I love the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, and I love the rich mineral resources of the Northwest even more. Because I know that the development of these mineral resources is closely linked with the beautiful prospects of our country's socialist industrialization.

    我热爱祖国的西北地质部西北
    地质局工程师兼祁连山普查大队副队长  严济南
    一九五二年春天，我还在南京中国地质工作指导委员会矿产地质勘探局工作的时候，上级调我到西北去参加勘探一个金属矿床的工作。我一听到是勘探金属矿床，非常高兴；可是一种莫名其妙的忧虑情绪也同时产生。我顾虑西北地区生活艰苦，交通困难。同时我的爱人已经怀孕数月，需要照顾。这些顾虑甚至使我发生了动摇。后来我想到自己是个年轻的技术人员，又是一个地质工作者，应当到祖国工业建设的最前线去。艰苦的岗位就是光荣的岗位，艰苦的地方才是锻炼自己的熔炉；家庭问题组织上是会照顾的。经过一番思想斗争以后，我毅然乘着火车到祖国的西北来了。
    到西北之后，首先碰到的是吃饭问题。我在南方工作，多半是吃大米，当我们初到西北山区时，多半吃的是馒头和面条，开始时不太习惯。但当我想到毛主席领导中国工农红军过雪山草地，吃草根树皮的情景时，又感到这算什么痛苦呢？没有几天，也就很自然地习惯了。现在我一顿能吃好几个大馒头。特别对这里的牛羊肉，发生了兴趣。这里的牛羊肉细而味美，没有那么大的腥味。一九五五年三月，我回到上海看我的爱人和孩子。我爱人见了我第一句话就是：“我以为你在西北被烤焦了，谁知道你比离开南京时还要健壮得多。”
    我们来西北之前，也曾听到过一些耸人听闻的传说。说什么西北一年四季都刮大风，风刮起来就是“飞砂走石，遮蔽天日，拔掉树木，吹倒房屋”等等。其实哪里有那么可怕的事呢！我们到了戈壁滩里，也曾遇到几次最大的风砂天，俗名刮“黑风”。但黑风并不那么可怕，也没有那么多，一个春天有个几次就算了不起了。风来了在屋子里、帐篷里避一避，一阵儿就过去了，然后又是风和日暖的好天气。我们到了祁连山里面，那里有巍峨的山峦，翠绿的树木，清新的空气和潺潺的流水，你想看风砂也看不到了。
    我是地质勘探队的成员，我们所到的地方都是荒山僻野。在那些深山里，我们经常接触到勤劳朴素的各族同胞。他们对我们真诚的协助和热情的支持，深深感动我们，使我们更加热爱自己的工作。有一次我们在一个地方工作了一个整天没有找到水喝，同志们都有些心烦起来。这时，我们看到有一位五六十岁的老人，正在山头放羊。我们向他招手呼唤，他明白了我们的意思后，就把蓄存的一罐子泉水，送到我们面前。同志们一口气把水饮完了。这位老人好像不知疲倦似的，也不管他的羊群了，飞也似地带着罐子跑进山去，总有个把钟头工夫，又给我们取回来很多甜水，帮我们烧开来喝。他站在一旁满意地看着我们那股贪婪劲，微微发笑。他看看我们跟前放的各种样石，又把周围几十里路以内每一个山上有些什么相同的、奇怪的石头都告诉了我们。我们向他道谢，他回答道：“你们是来给国家找宝贝，给咱们找福气来啦，我们帮帮忙算啥？”这位老人家的话使我当时激动得流下泪来。
      祁连山还住了许多藏民，他们待人宽厚诚实，并且热忱地协助我们工作。我们有一个分队，曾经困在雪山深谷里，蔬菜肉类好长时间供应不上，当地藏民猎户们就钻到山里去，打鹿子，打黄羊，送给我们吃。在额济纳旗境内工作的时候，我们骑着骆驼，走遍了大戈壁。蒙族同胞们听说我们是毛主席派来的找矿的人，宁可自己忍饥挨渴也要把随身带的水和干粮送给我们，有时候很热情很坚决地拉我们到他们的蒙古包里去喝酒、吃饭。
    我热爱伟大祖国的西北，我热爱西北的各族人民，我更热爱祖国西北丰富的矿产资源。因为我知道，这些矿产资源的开发，同我们祖国社会主义工业化的美丽远景是紧密连系在一起的。
