Technical Exchange Activities in Foreign Economic Exhibitions in China
Zhu Ji-qun

Over the past five years, fraternal countries have held dozens of exhibitions in our country, and these exhibitions have included experience exchange activities. Especially in some specialized industrial exhibitions, such as the Czechoslovak Republic's New Industrial Machinery Products Exhibition held in Beijing in 1954, and the Hungarian Textile Testing Instrument Exhibition that opened in Beijing's Temple of Heaven on May 21st this year, specialized technical exchanges were conducted. These exchanges of experiences and technologies have been helpful to our country's economic construction. However, the "technical exchange" we are talking about here mainly refers to a series of large-scale, extensive, and in-depth technical exchange activities organized and planned in some large-scale economic exhibitions.

The fraternal countries have held five large-scale economic exhibitions or large-scale comprehensive exhibitions focusing on industry in our capital. The technical exchange activities in these exhibitions started with the German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition in May 1953.

When preparing for the German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition, neither China nor Germany mentioned the issue of technical exchange. A few days after the opening of the exhibition, because visitors raised many production technology questions to the office and requested that experts be asked to help solve them, this activity was started sporadically after temporary research and consultation with foreign guests. Soon after this activity started, representatives from factories and mines in remote areas also came to participate in talks, seminars, and report meetings. At first, one or two visitors had a conversation with an expert through an on-site interpreter. Later, we gave this simplest method of technical exchange a name, called "problem conversation." Later, as the number of people increased and the questions became more specialized and in-depth, it gradually expanded into a "special topic discussion." After a few days, the talks naturally developed into "seminars"; the "seminars" were further expanded, and "report meetings" appeared. Some problems could not be completely solved through the above methods, and finally the method of "on-site guidance" was created. The first time for "on-site guidance" was to the Xinhua Printing Factory. The Xinhua Printing Factory had many printing presses from the German Democratic Republic, and due to many problems in installation and operation, production efficiency was not high. At the request of the factory, three experts worked in the workshop for more than ten days. In this short period of time, many workers mastered new technologies and greatly improved productivity.

When the German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition was exhibited in Shanghai, Shanghai learned from Beijing's experience, and the technical exchange activities were further improved, and the results were even greater. The friends from the German Democratic Republic were also satisfied. In the report they made to the government after returning home, they specifically mentioned the issue of technical exchange. They suggested that the government send more company experts as representatives in future exhibitions abroad.

During the Polish People's Republic Economic Exhibition, technical exchange had become a planned activity. A special department was established in the organizational structure to handle this work. The technical exchange activities have been significantly improved in terms of quantity and quality, and the effect of "on-site guidance" is even more obvious. For example, after Polish experts went to the Jinan Railway Bureau to provide guidance on the installation and operation methods of the powered wheel lathe, it originally took six and a half hours to rotate a pair of wheels, but now it only takes more than two hours, and labor productivity has increased by more than two times.

During the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition, technical exchange activities have undergone new developments. It can be said that it has risen to a higher level and developed to a more complete stage. The characteristics of the technical exchange of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition are first reflected in the initiative of both parties. Not only do we want to take advantage of the exhibition to conduct comprehensive learning from the Soviet Union; on the Soviet friends' side, they also regard the exhibition as a demonstration. Because the requirements of both parties are consistent, each exhibit has become a material for practical teaching, and the exhibition has become a university. From the construction process of the "Soviet Exhibition Hall," which was called the first exhibit by Soviet friends, our engineers conducted rich and systematic learning. During the entire preparation, exhibition, and closing period of the exhibition, Comrade Vasilyev gave strict education to the 370 technicians we transferred from 83 factories and mines in 21 large and small cities across the country in terms of machine installation, operation, and disassembly. These more than 300 technicians were also divided into 20 professional groups according to industrial courses, and 46 Soviet experts gave lectures. A total of 650 classes were taught, totaling 925 hours, and 2,120 copies of lecture notes were copied at the same time. During the exhibition, 1,086 units in more than 50 cities in various industrial sectors participated in technical exchange activities. In addition, when the machines were unpacked, 8,320 copies of technical data, including 78 kinds of machines and instruments, were copied, and 648,389 copies of machine samples, including 238 kinds of machines, were printed and distributed. The learning of so many advanced technologies and the acquisition of valuable technical data will play a great role in our economic construction. For example, the Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, under the guidance of Soviet experts, has quickly mastered the technology of using electron microscopes. After experts from the Beijing People's Machinery Factory went to the factory to provide guidance, they learned the resistance welding method of high-speed cutting tools, which improved work efficiency by four times. According to the Soviet experts' suggestion, the factory changed the small round-head tool used for finishing the gantry planer's tool to a plate knife, and the work efficiency increased by 15 times.

With the model of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition, the Czechoslovak Ten Years of Socialist Construction Achievements Exhibition established a "Technical Exchange Reception Room" at the beginning, and specifically stipulated the time for professional visits. During the last five days of professional visits, both China and Czechoslovakia concentrated their efforts on technical exchange work, so the effectiveness of the technical exchange of the Czechoslovak Ten Years of Socialist Construction Achievements Exhibition was also very significant.

The aircraft performance was unique to the Czechoslovak Ten Years of Socialist Construction Achievements Exhibition. Czechoslovakia's aviation industry has a long history. Their performance of trainers and gliders, as well as the driving training and gliding technology seminars held with relevant units, have greatly inspired and encouraged our national defense sports. The Czechoslovak Ten Years of Socialist Construction Achievements Exhibition had the most "report meetings" and "on-site guidance," and the effects were all very good. For example, the four A-3 electro-analytical balances of the Non-ferrous Metals Comprehensive Research Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry used to be rusted because they did not know how to use them. After the Czechoslovak experts inspected and explained the usage methods, three of them have been put into use. Two workers from the Jinan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory have mastered the technology of Su50, Su90, VR8, and HD12 models of lathes after expert guidance. After experts taught classes for 12 days to units such as the Statistics Factory of the Beijing Railway Administration, the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, the Central Meteorological Bureau, the National Bureau of Statistics, and the Statistics Factories of the Harbin and Zhengzhou Railway Administrations, they all learned the technology of installation, repair, adjustment, and use of statistical machines.

    国外来华经济展览会中的技术交流活动
    朱及群
    五年来，各兄弟国家来我国举办的各种展览会有几十个，这些展览会上都有一些经验交流活动。特别是在一些专项工业展览会上，如一九五四年里捷克斯洛伐克共和国在北京举办的工业机械新产品展览会，和今年五月二十一日在北京天坛开幕的匈牙利纺织试验仪器展览会，都进行了专业的技术交流。这些经验及技术的交流，对于我国的经济建设都有一定的帮助。但我们这里所谈的“技术交流”，主要还不是指的这些，而是指的在一些大型经济性的展览会上有组织有计划地进行的一系列的规模宏大、广泛而深入的技术交流活动。
    兄弟国家来我国首都举办过的大型经济性的、或是以工业为重点的大型综合性的展览会共有五个。这种展览会上的技术交流活动是从一九五三年五月的德意志民主共和国工业展览会开始的。
    在筹备德意志民主共和国工业展览会的时候，中德双方都不曾谈起技术交流的问题。在展览会开幕几天之后，由于观众在参观中向办公室提出了很多生产技术上的问题要求转请专家帮助解决，才临时和外宾研究协商，零星地开始了这项活动。这项活动开始不久，远地的厂矿也派代表来参加会谈、座谈和报告会。开头是一两位观众经过现场上的译员和一位专家进行交谈。我们后来给这种最简单的技术交流方式起个名字，叫“问题交谈”。以后，人数增多了，问题专深了，就逐步扩大为一种“专题会谈”。没有几天，会谈又很自然地发展成为“座谈会”；“座谈会”再扩大，就出现了“报告会”。有些问题，通过以上几种方式仍不能得到彻底的解决，最后就产生了“下场指导”的办法。“下场指导”的第一次是到新华印刷厂去。新华印刷厂有很多民主德国印刷机，由于安装和操作上存在着不少问题，生产效率不高。经该厂请求，有三位专家到车间工作了十多天。在这短短的时间里，有很多工人掌握了新技术，大大提高了生产率。
    德意志民主共和国工业展览会在上海展出时，上海吸取了北京的经验，技术交流活动有了进一步的提高，收到的效果更大。民主德国朋友也感到满意。他们在回国以后向政府所作的报告中，特别提到了技术交流的问题。他们建议政府在今后出国展览时多派公司的专家作代表。
    在波兰人民共和国经济展览会期间，技术交流已经成为一种有计划的活动。在组织机构上设立了专门搞此项工作的部门。技术交流活动在量和质方面都有显著的提高，“下场指导”的效果更加明显。例如波兰专家到济南铁路局对动轮旋床安装和操作方法作了指导以后，旋一对车轮原来用六小时半，现在只用二小时多了，劳动生产率提高了两倍多。
    到苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会期间，技术交流活动有了新的发展。可以说，它已上升到更高级的方式，发展到更完备的地步。苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会技术交流的特点，首先表现在双方的主动性上。不仅我们要借展览的方便，向苏联进行全面的学习；在苏联友人方面，也把展览会当作示范。由于双方要求一致，每件展品都成了实物教学的材料，展览会变成了一个大学校。从被苏联朋友称为第一件展品的“苏联展览馆”建筑过程中，我们的工程师们就进行了丰富而系统的学习。在整个展览会的筹备、展出和结束期间，华西里也夫同志对我们从全国二十一个大小城市、八十三个厂矿调来的三百七十名技术人员，在机器安装、操作及拆卸方面给予了严格的教育。这三百多名技术人员还按照工业上的课程门类分成二十个专业小组，由四十六位苏联专家上课讲授。前后上了六百五十次课，共计讲授了九百二十五个小时，同时，复印了二千一百二十份讲课笔记。在展览期间，各个工业部门五十多个城市共有一千零八十六个单位参加了技术交流活动。此外，在机器开箱时，还复制了包括七十八种机器和仪器的八千三百二十份技术资料，印发了包括二百三十八种机器的六十四万八千三百八十九份机器样本。这么多先进技术的学习和珍贵技术资料的取得，对我们经济建设将起很大的作用。如重工业部钢铁实验所在苏联专家指导下，已经很快地掌握了电子显微镜的使用技术。北京人民机器厂在专家下厂指导以后，学会了高速切削刀具的电阻焊刀方法，提高工作效率四倍。该厂按照苏联专家的意见将龙门刨床的刀具在精加工时用的小圆头刀改用板儿刀以后，工作效率提高了十五倍。
    有了苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的模本，捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会一开始就成立了“技术交流接待室”，并特别规定了专业参观的时间。在末五天专业参观期间，中捷两方面都集中力量专搞技术交流工作，所以捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会技术交流的成效也是很大的。
    飞机表演是捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会所特有的。捷克斯洛伐克的航空工业很有历史。他们这次的教练机与滑翔机的表演以及和有关单位举行的驾驶训练、滑翔技术座谈会，对于我们的国防体育起着很大的启发和鼓舞作用。捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会的“报告会”和“下场指导”都是最多的，效果也都很好。如重工业部有色金属综合研究所的四台A——3型电分析天平，过去因为不会使用放的生了锈，这次经捷克斯洛伐克专家给予检修、讲解了使用方法以后，三台已经使用起来。济南机车车辆修理厂的两名工人，经过专家指导，已经掌握了Su50、Su90、VR8及HD12等型号车床的技术。北京铁路管理局统计工厂、铁道部统计局、中央气象局、国家统计局和哈尔滨和郑州铁路管理局统计工厂等单位，请专家讲了十二天课以后，都学会了统计机的安装、检修、调整和使用的技术。
