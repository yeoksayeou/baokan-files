Seeing the Two-Faced Tricks from the Film "An Unforgettable Incident"
    Feng Ming
    The Soviet film "An Unforgettable Incident," which exposes the sabotage activities of hidden enemies against writers, is being re-released in major cities across the country at a time when our people are launching a struggle to crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and expose all hidden counter-revolutionaries. It plays a significant role in enhancing and enriching our knowledge of political struggle. If the great exposure of the Hu Feng clique has given us a great lesson, then this film is a fitting supplementary teaching material.
    There is an old Chinese saying: "A soft knife cuts off the head without realizing death." The hidden enemy, especially the enemy disguised in a "cultural" cloak, is accustomed to using this kind of trick. In the film, Vorisky, the White Army officer hidden in the old bookstore, says: "Pulling a trigger? A three-year-old can do that. We don't need bullets here; what we need is something that can strike him spiritually, make him dispirited..." This is exactly the meaning. Hu Feng said: "In order to exhaust it, in order to break through it, we must entangle it," "This becomes a war of nerves, making them uneasy," which is nothing more than this meaning. The enemy has their "dark cleverness." In covert activities, they always seek that "good method" that "wounds without leaving visible scars on the surface."
    However, we often think too naively. As Stalin said, "thinking that the enemy is still those with fierce faces, huge teeth, fat necks, and holding half a gun." In fact, in order to "penetrate into" the "livers of" the people, they have long disguised themselves and "renewed their faces." As Vorisky said: "Friends... we should always be very kind and humble to others; we must not oppose anyone, we must not quarrel with anyone, we must speak according to their feelings, and we must never offend anyone." Indeed, except for that "culturally too poor" minion Boiko who couldn't hold back and had a quarrel with the editor-in-chief of the newspaper and was fired, the other hidden counter-revolutionaries were still using tears or smiles to disguise themselves as very kind until the last moment before the conspiracy was finally exposed. Bandiesh, the head of the assassination group and agent number thirteen, played this trick particularly skillfully. When the writer Kalmash's work "Servants," which exposed international espionage crimes, was "criticized" by the local newspaper before it was published because bad elements exploited loopholes, look how "concerned" she said: "I'm really worried about Sasha. Why must he write such a book! Others write novels, stories, plays, write about a backward factory director, write about an advanced prefectural party secretary, how safe they are... But Sasha always has to be a little more than others!" This is truly a veteran of "speaking according to their feelings"! And another counter-revolutionary leader, the bourgeois nationalist Yarchuk, shouted loudly after receiving this newspaper: "This kind of thing is really unreasonable and simply absurd!" He even went to the podium of the Peace Conference to express his "indignation." But later we learned that it was none other than he himself who wrote the "criticism" defaming Kalmash's work. Look how beautifully he played this two-faced trick!
    The Hu Feng clique's tricks are no less than theirs. Didn't Hu Feng also say "don't touch the literal meaning," "where possible, we should also go along with" the Party and the people? When Shu Wu passed through Wuhan, didn't Hu Feng earnestly instruct Luyuan to "be as kind as possible to him, ask him for advice... be sure to ask him for advice as kindly as possible, the more the better"? Fang Ran, a key member of the Hu Feng clique, put their strategy more clearly: "In short, it must be a positive, 'no distance' attitude: ...no excuses, no silence; no complaints to anyone," and also "submit an application to join the Party"! When "Wenyi Bao" was criticized last year, Hu Feng said at a public meeting that he was "very sad" to see "old comrades fail," but in a secret letter to his followers, he said, "The two Mas and the newspaper 'took the lead' in making self-criticisms and conducting in-depth reviews, how good it looks!" How does this compare to Yarchuk's method in the film? Two-faced people always have something in common.
    Although two-faced people are cunning and changeable, they inevitably reveal some flaws and show their feet since they are fundamentally opposed to the revolution. Just as Sun Wukong transformed into a temple, his tail had nowhere to be placed, so he had to put it behind the temple as a flagpole. Bandiesh's "excessive concern" for the Kalmash family and her efforts to provoke discord in the family made the writer's wife Anna suspicious, and Bandiesh's attempt to bribe the female worker Grasha also aroused the other party's vigilance; Yarchuk's words made people feel very "insincere," and these are the flaws. How can a person who writes an article himself and then pretends to be indignant about it be sincere? How can a person who writes "how good it looks" with schadenfreude in a secret letter and then sheds "sad" tears for the failure of old comrades at the meeting be sincere? Although Hu Feng called for "sincerity" with a deafening voice, there were still many people who felt his hypocrisy. This is the flaw. If we can detect these flaws in time, raise our vigilance, we can avoid or reduce being fooled by them.
    From here, we can see some of the rules of two-faced people. We must understand these rules, study their cunning and their weaknesses, in order to defeat them. This is one aspect of what we can further deepen our understanding from this film, in connection with the Hu Feng incident.
    At the same time, there is another aspect, that is, pride, complacency, covering up mistakes, individualism, etc., are all gaps that hidden counter-revolutionaries seek. It is no accident that Danichenko, the self-proclaimed college student who lost his Communist Youth League membership card and wanted to cover up his mistakes, became the object of Yarchuk's indoctrination of nationalistic poison and the object of Vorisky's attempt to win over and utilize. The editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Fedechinko, was exploited by the enemy due to the prevalence of individualism. And the secretary of the provincial party committee raised this issue more sharply, and he also criticized Anna's "weakness of lacking a fighting spirit," Kalmash's "excessive restraint," and his own "insufficient concern," saying that it is not surprising that someone took advantage of these loopholes. Yes, the hidden enemy wants to take advantage of these loopholes. They are "constantly watching the direction." Didn't the Hu Feng clique also list those who had made mistakes ideologically and politically as objects for "talk"? Hu Feng said: "A blade of grass is nourished by a drop of dew," and they are counting on the individualism, liberalism, various mistakes and bad tendencies in the revolutionary ranks to nourish them. Isn't this situation worthy of our great vigilance?
    The pen is a weapon. The enemy also understands this. Vorisky, the anti-Soviet saboteur in the film, said: "A successful work is a beautiful victory. But to be able to prevent his work from being published is our victory." Therefore, while the enemy is conspiring to sabotage other aspects of our country's construction, they will inevitably pay attention to activities in the cultural and artistic fields, attempting to strike the people spiritually and ideologically and undermine the people's revolutionary cause. The conspiratorial activities carried out by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in our revolutionary literary and art camp are precisely like this. However, our pen-wielding warriors often lose their sense of the enemy's situation. The fact that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was mixed in the revolutionary literary and art camp for so long before being exposed shows that our vigilance is not high, and we have even simply lost our vigilance. However, a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit. The Hu Feng incident has awakened us and educated us. Our people across the country have learned lessons from this incident. We must study, we must improve our class vigilance and political sensitivity, expose all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and resolutely suppress them. We must learn from our own experience, and we must also learn from other aspects. In this sense, the film "An Unforgettable Incident" is indeed the best supplementary teaching material for us to learn the ability to distinguish and expose hidden enemies and to learn the knowledge of political struggle from the Hu Feng incident.
    Let us also take the Hu Feng incident as an unforgettable event and firmly remember this lesson!

### 从影片“不能忘记这件事”看两面派的伎俩

    从影片“不能忘记这件事”看两面派的伎俩
    冯明
    以揭露暗藏敌人对作家的暗害活动为主题的苏联影片“不能忘记这件事”，在我国人民展开粉碎胡风反革命集团和揭露一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争的时候，再次在全国各主要城市上演，对提高和丰富我们的政治斗争知识，有很大的作用。如果说，对胡风集团的大揭露，给我们上了一堂大课，那末，这部影片就是恰好的辅助教材。
    中国有句老话：“软刀子割头不觉死”。暗藏的敌人，特别是披着“文化”外衣的敌人，惯用的手法正是这一种。影片里那个隐藏在旧书铺里的白匪军官沃里斯基说：“扳枪机子吗，三岁小孩也会扳哪。我们这儿不需要枪弹，我们需要的是一种能打击他精神上的东西，叫他意志消沉……”，正是这种意思。胡风说：“为了累倒它，为了冲破它，就得缠住它”，“这就成了神经战，使他们不安”，也不外是这种意思。敌人有他们的“阴暗的聪明”，在隐蔽的活动中，他们总是寻求那种“打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”的“好方法”的。
    可是，我们却常常把事情想得过于天真，像斯大林所说的，“以为敌人还是些面孔凶恶，牙齿巨大，颈项肥胖，持着半截枪的人”。其实他们为了“深入到”人民的“肝脏里面”来，早已乔装打扮、“面目一新”了。还是那个沃里斯基说的：“朋友……对别人我们应当永远很和蔼，很谦虚；不能反对任何一个人，不能和任何一个人吵嘴，要顺情说话，决不许得罪人。”的确，除了那个“文化程度实在太差”的小喽啰波依柯沉不住气，同报纸总编辑吵了一通，被裁掉了以外，其他几个暗藏的反革命分子，直到阴谋最后被揭破的前一刻，还在用眼泪或微笑，把自己打扮得很善良。暗害集团的头子，十三号谍报员班迭什，这套把戏玩得尤其熟练。当作家卡尔马什的揭露国际间谍罪行的作品“奴仆们”，由于坏分子钻了空子，在出版之前就受到当地报纸的“批评”的时候，瞧，她说得多么“关心”：“真替沙沙担心。为什么必得写这样的书！别人都是写点小说，写故事，写剧本，写个落后的厂长啦，写一个先进的地委书记啦，人家，多平安……可沙沙哩，总得比别人多点什么！”这真是“顺情说话”的老手！而另一个反革命头子，资产阶级民族主义分子雅尔丘克呢，在拿到这份报纸之后，大嚷大叫地喊道：“这种事情实在不近情理，简直荒唐到家啦！”甚至还跑到保卫和平大会的讲台上去表示了他的“愤慨”。可是，后来我们知道了，写这篇诽谤卡尔马什的作品的“批评”的，不是别人，正是他自己。瞧，他这种两面派手法玩得多么漂亮！
    胡风集团的伎俩也不亚于他们。胡风不是也说过“字面上不要去碰”，“可能的地方还要顺着”党和人民之类的话吗？舒芜过武汉时，胡风不是谆谆地叮嘱过绿原，说要“对他尽量和气些，多请教……千万和和气气的请教他，愈多愈好”么？胡风集团的骨干分子方然把他们的这种策略说得更明白：“总之，一定要是积极的、无‘距离’的态度：……不推托，不沉默；不对任何人发什么牢骚”，而且还要“送上入党申请书”哩！去年“文艺报”受到批评时，胡风在公开的会上说什么“看到老同志失败”，他是“很难过”的，而在给他的党徒的密信里，却说“二马和该报‘带头’检讨，并深入检查，够好看的！”这比之影片里的雅尔丘克的手法如何？两面派也总是有它一面共通之处的。
    两面派分子尽管狡猾、善变，但他们骨子里既要反对革命，就不免露出些破绽，露出些马脚来的。正如孙行者变作庙宇，尾巴无处安插，只好放在庙后当做一根旗杆一样。班迭什对于作家卡尔马什一家的“过份的关心”，竭力挑拨家庭的不睦，已使作家的妻子安娜感到怀疑，班迭什对女工格拉莎的收买，也引起了对方的警觉；雅尔丘克的话，使人感到很不“真诚”，这些就是破绽。一个人自己写的文章，自己又来装腔作势地对此表示愤慨，他怎么能够真诚呢？一个人在密信里幸灾乐祸地写过“够好看的”之后，又到大会上去为老同志的失败流洒“难过”的眼泪，他怎么能够真诚呢？虽然胡风把“真诚”叫得震天价响，但是还有不少人感到了他的虚伪。这就是破绽。我们能够及时地发觉这些破绽，提高警惕，就可以不上或者少上他们的当。
    从这里，我们可以看出两面派分子的某些规律。我们必须懂得他们这套规律，研究他们的狡猾的地方和他们的弱点，才能战胜他们。这就是从这部影片，联系到胡风事件，我们可以进一步加深我们的认识的一个方面。
    同时，还有另一个方面，那就是骄傲自负、掩饰错误、个人主义，等等，都是暗藏的反革命分子寻找的空隙。影片里那个自命不凡的、丢了团证而想掩盖错误的大学生丹钦柯，成了雅尔丘克灌输民族主义毒素的对象，成了沃里斯基想要拉拢利用的对象，不是偶然的。报社的总编辑菲德钦告，由于个人主义作崇，被敌人钻了空子。而省委书记把这个问题提得更尖锐，他还批评了安娜的“缺乏斗争性的弱点”，卡尔马什的“过份的拘谨”，以及自己的“不够关心”，说有人利用了这些空子，是没有什么奇怪的。是的，暗藏的敌人就是要利用这些空子的。他们在时时刻刻“窥测方向”。胡风集团不是也把那些思想上政治上犯有错误的人，列为“可谈”的对象的吗？胡风说：“一根草有一粒露水养”，他们就是指望革命队伍中的个人主义、自由主义、各种错误和不良倾向来滋养他们的。这种情况，难道不值得我们大大警惕吗？
    笔就是武器。敌人也很懂得这点。影片里的反苏维埃的暗害分子沃里斯基说：“一部成功的作品，就是一个漂亮的胜仗。但是要能叫他的作品不能出版，就是我们的胜仗。”所以，敌人在阴谋破坏我们国家的其它方面的建设的同时，也必然要注意文化艺术方面的活动，企图从精神上、思想意识上来打击人民，破坏人民的革命事业。胡风反革命集团在我们革命文艺阵营中所进行的阴谋活动，就正是这样的。但，我们的拿笔的战士们，却常常失掉了敌情观念，胡风反革命集团混在革命文艺阵营里这样久才被揭露。就说明了我们的警惕性是不高的，甚至简直丧失了警惕性。但，吃一堑长一智，胡风事件警醒了我们，教育了我们。我们全国人民都从这一事件中吸取教训。我们要学习，要提高阶级警惕性和政治敏感，把一切暗藏的反革命分子揭露出来，并坚决地把他们镇压下去。我们要从切身经验中学习，也要从其它方面学习。从这个意义上说，“不能忘记这件事”这部影片，的确是我们从胡风事件中学习辨别和揭露暗藏敌人的本领，学习政治斗争知识的一本最好的辅助教材。
    让我们也把胡风事件作为不能忘记的事，牢牢地记取这个教训吧！
