Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: Cotton planting has mostly concluded in all cotton-producing areas across the country. Preliminary statistics from late May indicate that the national cotton planting area has reached 98% of the planned requirement, significantly exceeding last year's harvested area. The cotton planting plans in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Xinjiang, Liaoning, and other provinces have been completed or overfulfilled. Farmers in the wheat-cotton double-cropping areas of the Yangtze River basin are continuing to plant cotton, and farmers in Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces in the Yellow River basin will also plant some wheat stubble cotton after harvesting wheat. It is expected that the national cotton field area can be completed according to plan.

This year, in arranging cotton planting tasks, all regions have implemented the principle of concentrating planting in suitable cotton-growing areas and high-yield cotton areas. For example, in Henan Province, the unit area yield in eastern, western, and northern Henan exceeds the provincial average by 20% to 60%. This year, the province expanded cotton fields by 900,000 mu, all concentrated in these three cotton areas. All regions have further paid attention to adopting improved varieties and rational close planting. Hebei Province, which accounts for more than one-fifth of the national cotton field area, has universally planted excellent cotton varieties. In Shandong Province, the planting area of improved cotton varieties accounted for 67% of the total cotton planting area last year, and this year it has reached nearly 80%. In Heze Prefecture of this province, farmers were previously accustomed to spot planting and sparse planting, resulting in very low cotton yields. This year, under the guidance of agricultural technology extension stations, strip planting and close planting have been widely adopted. Farmers in the Jinan Prefecture of Shanxi Province, in order to make the cotton mature early and reduce frost damage, have followed the experience of cotton production model Qu Yaoli, advancing the sowing period by two to four days. At the same time, the general sowing amount of cotton fields in the entire prefecture has increased by two to three jin per mu compared to last year, the planting area of improved varieties has expanded fourfold compared to last year, and the fertilization area and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu have also increased by 10% compared to last year. In addition to expanding the planting area of improved cotton varieties, farmers in Sichuan Province have also taken various measures to strive for timely planting to avoid autumn rain damage and harvest cotton early. In addition, some cotton-producing areas have encountered drought, and the local Party and government leading organs have led farmers to carry out drought-resistant planting.

After the end of cotton planting, farmers in all regions quickly launched activities to check seedlings, replant seedlings, and protect seedlings, striving to achieve full seedling emergence. Currently, all regions are stepping up their efforts to carry out thinning, transplanting, weeding, pest control, and other tasks.

This year, in addition to receiving a large amount of agricultural production loans and cotton advance purchase deposits from the state, farmers in all cotton-producing areas have also received preferential treatment such as buying more grain, cotton cloth, fertilizer, and coal. Many new-style animal-powered farm implements, such as double-wheel double-铧 plows, double-wheel single-铧 plows, and three-tooth lightweight cultivators, have been promoted in all cotton-producing areas. Most of the more than 400 million jin of cotton seeds stored by the state have been supplied to farmers. The supply of chemical fertilizers to farmers in all cotton-producing areas has increased by nearly 50% compared to last year. All cotton-producing areas are also actively preparing pest control machinery and pesticides, planning to treat more than 36 million mu of cotton fields with pesticides.

    各产棉区棉花播种大部结束
    全国棉花播种面积接近计划要求
    新华社四日讯　全国各产棉区已大部结束棉花播种。五月下旬初步统计，全国棉花播种面积已达到计划要求的百分之九十八，比去年收获面积超过很多。河北、山东、山西、江苏、四川、浙江、新疆、辽宁等省的植棉计划都已完成或超额完成。现在长江流域麦、棉两熟地区农民还在继续播种棉花，黄河流域的河南、陕西等省农民也将在收割小麦后再种一部分麦茬棉花。预计全国棉田面积可以按计划完成。
    今年各地在布置植棉任务中，都贯彻了集中种植在适宜植棉的地区和高产棉区的精神。例如河南省豫东、豫西、豫北单位面积产量超过全省平均产量百分之二十至六十，今年全省扩大棉田九十万亩，都集中在这三个棉区。各地并进一步注意了采用良种和合理密植等。棉田面积占全国五分之一以上的河北省，普遍播种了优良棉种。山东省棉花良种播种面积占棉花播种总面积去年是百分之六十七，今年已达到近百分之八十。这个省的菏泽专区农民过去习惯点种、稀植，棉花产量很低；今年在农业技术推广站的指导下，相当普遍地采用了条播和密植。山西省晋南专区农民为使棉花早熟，减少霜后花，纷纷学习棉花丰产模范曲耀离的经验，把播种期提前了两天到四天；同时全专区棉田播种量一般是每亩比去年增加了二、三斤，良种播种面积比去年扩大了四倍，施肥面积和每亩施肥量也都比去年增加了百分之十。四川省农民除扩大棉花良种播种面积外，还采取多种办法努力做到适时播种，以避免秋雨为害，提早收花。此外，部分产棉区遇到干旱，当地党、政领导机关领导农民进行了抗旱播种。
    各地农民在棉花播种结束后，都迅速展开查苗、补苗、保苗活动，争取达到全苗。目前，各地正在加紧进行间苗、移苗、锄草、治虫等工作。
    今年各产棉区农民除得到国家大量农业生产贷款和棉花预购定金外，还得到多买粮食、棉布、肥料、煤炭等的优待。各产棉区都推广了许多双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁、三齿轻便耘锄等新式畜力农具。国家储备的四亿多斤棉种，已大部供应给农民。供应各产棉区农民的化学肥料，比去年增加近百分之五十。各产棉区还积极准备治虫药械，计划用药械治虫的棉田达三千六百多万亩。
