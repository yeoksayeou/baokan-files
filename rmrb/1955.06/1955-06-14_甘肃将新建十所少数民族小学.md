To assist ethnic minorities in developing their educational endeavors, the Gansu Provincial Department of Education has decided to allocate funds this year to build ten new junior primary schools in the Sunan Yugur Autonomous Region, Aksai Kazakh Autonomous Region, Alxa Banner of the Gansu Tibetan Autonomous Region, Dongxiang Autonomous Region, Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous Region, and Xiahe County of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region. Eight complete primary schools will also be expanded. Upon completion, these schools will be able to enroll an additional 1,400 minority children. Ethnic groups with their own written languages will also have the opportunity to study their own languages in these schools. (Our Lanzhou-based reporter)
