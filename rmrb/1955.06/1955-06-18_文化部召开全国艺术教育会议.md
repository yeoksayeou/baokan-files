    The meeting summarized the achievements of art education. The meeting held that China's art education has made great progress in recent years. There are currently fourteen higher art colleges, eleven affiliated art secondary schools, seven opera schools, and one secondary-level dance school and one film school in the country. The art colleges and schools have trained a large number of art cadres for the country. However, with the development of national economic construction and cultural and artistic undertakings, new tasks and requirements have been put forward for art education.

    The meeting affirmed the policy of adjustment, rectification, quality improvement, and steady development, based on the current situation of art education and the general policy of cultural and educational work.

    The meeting discussed the issue of improving teaching quality, believing that it is necessary to implement the policy of cultivating students' all-round development and correct the current tendency to neglect political and ideological education; it also pointed out that improving teachers' political and professional level is the key to improving teaching quality, and the leadership of art education at all levels must take concrete measures to do a good job in teachers' comprehensive further study; and strive to gradually complete the formulation and revision of unified teaching plans and teaching syllabuses for various majors in art colleges and schools within a certain period; improve the teaching organization of various colleges and universities, strengthen scientific research work; unite and transform old teachers and train new teachers in a planned way, strengthen the foundation of secondary and primary art schools, and strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, all of which are indispensable parts of improving quality. The meeting studied the issue of improving the enrollment work of art colleges and schools, believing that there should be practical and strict requirements for the political quality, cultural level, artistic talent, and physique of admitted students, and that the work of selecting talents from amateur art activities and regular enrollment should be combined to select young people with truly good qualities and artistic talents to be cultivated in art schools. The meeting especially studied the issue of vigorously absorbing students from worker-peasant backgrounds and ethnic minority students, and training and improving on-the-job cadres, and put forward specific measures respectively.

    The meeting examined the bourgeois ideology existing in art education and criticized the ideas of art being divorced from politics, neglecting the tradition of national art, and neglecting popularization work. It pointed out that art education must serve China's socialist construction, must vigorously strengthen the teaching and research work of national and folk art, and must implement the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    More than 70 representatives from national drama, opera, music, fine arts, dance, film art colleges and related institutions attended the meeting.

    新华社十七日讯　中华人民共和国文化部六月六日到十五日在北京召开了全国艺术教育会议。
    这次会议着重讨论了艺术教育事业如何与国家需要进一步相适应的问题，以及如何提高艺术教育质量的问题。
    文化部代理部长钱俊瑞在开幕词中对会议作了重要指示，文化部副部长刘芝明作了“目前艺术教育的基本情况和今后任务”的报告。
    会议总结了艺术教育工作的成绩。会议认为，几年来，我国艺术教育事业有了很大发展。全国现有高等艺术院校十四所，附属艺术中学十一所，戏曲学校七所和中等性质的舞蹈、电影学校各一所。各艺术院、校为国家培养了大批的艺术干部。但是，随着国家经济建设和文化艺术事业的发展，给艺术教育事业提出了新的任务和要求。
    会议根据目前艺术教育的情况和文教工作的总方针，肯定了调整整顿、提高质量、稳步发展的方针。
    会议根据国家对各类艺术干部的需要，并针对目前艺术干部供不应求、质量不高的情况，对各类艺术院、校的学制、系科和专业设置等进行了必要的调整，并计划增设演员训练班、工艺美术专科学校、音乐小学等。
    会议讨论了提高教学质量的问题，认为必须贯彻培养学生全面发展的方针，纠正目前忽视政治思想教育的偏向；并指出提高教师的政治及专业水平是提高教学质量的关键所在，各级艺术教育的领导方面必须采取具体措施作好教师的全面进修工作；并争取在一定时期内逐步完成艺术院、校各专业的统一的教学计划、教学大纲的制定和修订工作；改善各院校的教学组织，加强科学研究工作；团结和改造老教师和有计划地培养新师资，加强中等和初等艺术学校的基础，努力学习苏联先进经验，都是提高质量不可缺少的部分。会议研究了改善艺术院、校的招生工作问题，认为对录取学生的政治质量、文化水平、艺术才能和体格都应有切合实际而又严格的要求，把经常从业余艺术活动中选拔人才和定期招生的工作结合起来，以求把真正品质优良和确具艺术才能的青年选拔到艺术学校来加以培养。会议特别研究了大力吸收工农成份学生和少数民族学生入学和调训提高在职干部的问题，并分别提出了具体办法。
    会议检查了艺术教育中存在的资产阶级思想，对艺术脱离政治、轻视民族艺术传统、忽视普及工作的思想进行了批判。指出艺术教育必须为我国社会主义建设服务，必须大力加强民族、民间艺术的教学和研究工作，必须贯彻为工农兵服务的方向。
    参加这次会议的有全国戏剧、戏曲、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影各类艺术院校和有关机关的代表七十余人。
