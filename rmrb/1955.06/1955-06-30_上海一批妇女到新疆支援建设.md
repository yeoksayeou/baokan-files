A batch of 1,200 women from Shanghai Municipality have come to Xinjiang Province to support Xinjiang's construction. They arrived in Hami, Urumqi, the Manas River Basin, and Yili in early June. Some of these women have attended senior or junior high school, some are nursery workers and nurses, and some were homeless orphans in the old society. After liberation, they learned handicrafts such as weaving towels and socks in production and education centers. More than 500 women arrived in the new city of Shihezi on the banks of the Manas River. Commanders of a certain unit of the Production and Construction Corps introduced to them the process of land reclamation and production over the past few years. They learned that this place used to be a barren grassland, but today towns have appeared on the grassland. In the new-style farms, canals crisscross, green trees provide shade, and tens of thousands of acres of fertile land grow cotton, wheat, rice, corn, soybeans, and other crops. The achievements of the soldiers' hard work moved them and encouraged them. They expressed that they would build the border of the motherland for a long time.

    上海一批妇女到新疆支援建设
    一千二百名妇女由上海市来新疆省支援新疆建设，她们已经在六月上旬先后到达哈密、乌鲁木齐、玛纳斯河流域和伊犁。这些妇女有的进过高中或初中，有的是保育员和护士，有的在旧社会是流浪的孤儿，解放以后，她们在生产教养所学会了织毛巾、袜子等手艺。其中五百多名妇女到了玛纳斯河畔的石河子新城后，生产建设部队某部的指挥员，给她们介绍了几年来开荒生产的经过。她们知道了这里过去是荒芜的草原，今天草原上出现了城镇；新型的农场里，渠道纵横，绿树成荫，万顷良田生长着棉花、小麦、水稻、玉米、大豆等农作物。战士们辛勤劳动获得的成就，感动了她们，鼓舞了她们，她们纷纷表示，要长期地建设祖国的边疆。
