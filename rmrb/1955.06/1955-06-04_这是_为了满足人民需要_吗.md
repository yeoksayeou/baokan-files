Is This "To Satisfy the Needs of the People"?
    Mou Lan
    The shops of the Xinxiang and Xuchang city food companies in Henan Province display a variety of luxuriously packaged high-end candies. The Xinxiang City company has more than thirty categories and one hundred thirty types. The Xuchang City company also has a considerable number. Customers who enter the store admire these candies with loving eyes. Some people want to buy a piece to try, but when they ask the price, a small box of "chocolate" candy costs 14.9 yuan, and a small piece of "chocolate" candy costs 0.73 yuan. Who would buy it? The Xinxiang City Food Company reduced the price of the candies by 30% to 40% of the original price, and occasionally some people picked the cheapest ones to buy one or two pieces, but the "chocolate" candy costing 14.9 yuan a small box has been "untouched." According to statistics, at the current sales volume of the Xuchang City Food Company, the "chocolate" candy costing 0.73 yuan a piece is enough to be sold for more than six years.
    Why do food companies operate so many expensive candies? It turns out that these two companies both have a store that also sells some candy. In the fourth quarter of last year, because of the local shortage of sugar, it was once out of stock. The leaders and staff of these two companies thought: Since department stores do not sell sugar, it is "to meet the needs of the people" for food companies to sell more candy. They had a flash of inspiration and did not consider the needs of the market. They sent people to Shanghai to grab and order goods. The business section chief of the Xinxiang City company personally went to Shanghai to grab the goods, and also ordered a batch of goods from Guangzhou, without considering the price at all, so a large number of high-end candies came in continuously.
    In the eyes of the leaders and staff of the food company, it is to meet the needs of the people to sell some candy when sugar is out of stock, and it is inevitable to have some goods in stock. However, they neither understood the market supply situation nor the increase in people's purchasing power. When they found that expensive candies had no sales, they blamed the city for being too small and the people's purchasing power for being low. They did not realize that state-owned commercial departments must conduct in-depth investigations and studies of the different needs of the vast consumers, and actively organize the supply of goods suitable for the people according to the specific circumstances of the improvement of people's living standards in different regions, different seasons, and different supply targets. Only in this way can we meet the needs of the vast consumers, speed up the circulation of goods, and continuously supply the needs of consumers. The approach of the leaders of the Xuchang and Xinxiang City Food Companies, who tried to meet the needs of consumers with expensive candies, is essentially irresponsible to consumers. The consequence will inevitably be that a large number of goods cannot be sold and a large amount of state funds are occupied, which is detrimental to both production and consumption.
    Now is the off-season for commerce. In order to prepare for the peak commercial season after autumn, state-owned commercial departments should actively prepare for the peak season supply. When organizing goods, all localities must remember the lessons of blind operation, understand the needs of residents in depth, and reasonably organize and allocate goods according to the different requirements of consumers, so as to better serve production and consumers.

    这是“为了满足人民需要”吗
    牟澜
    河南省新乡市和许昌市食品公司的门市部，陈列着各种装璜华丽的高级糖果。新乡市公司有三十多类、一百三十多种。许昌市公司也不少。顾客们一进门，都以爱慕的眼光参观这些糖果，也有人想买一块来尝尝，但一问价钱，一小盒
  “巧克力”糖要十四元九角，一小块“巧克力”糖要七角三分，有谁还会买呢？新乡市食品公司把糖果照原价降价百分之三十到四十，偶然有人挑选最便宜的买了一、二块，但十四元九角一小盒的“巧克力”糖，一直“无人问津”。据统计，按照现在许昌市食品公司的销量，七角三分一块的“巧克力”糖还足够销售六年多。
    为什么食品公司会经营这么多高贵的糖果呢？原来这两个公司都有一个门市部，也销售一部分糖果。去年第四季度时，因为当地食糖供应不足，曾经一度脱销。这两个公司的领导工作人员想：百货公司既然没有食糖销售，食品公司多销售一部分糖果，也是“为了满足人民需要”，他们就灵机一动，也没有考虑市场需要情况，就派人到上海去抓货、订货。新乡市公司的业务科长亲自出马，到上海抓了货不算，又向广州订了一批货，根本没有考虑价格的高低，于是大量的高级糖果就源源而来。
    在食品公司的领导工作人员看来，食糖脱销了，销售些糖果也是为了满足人民的需要，即使积压一些商品也是免不了。但是他们既不了解市场供应情况，又不了解人民购买力增长的情况。当他们发现高贵糖果没有销路时，反而怪城市太小，人民购买力不高。他们根本没有认识到国营商业部门必须深入调查研究广大消费者的不同需要，根据不同地区、不同季节和不同的供应对象，根据人民生活水平提高的具体情况，积极组织供应适合人民所需要的商品。只有这样，才能既满足广大消费者的需求，又能使商品流转加快，并不断地供应消费者的需要。像许昌和新乡市食品公司的领导同志这种灵机一动，企图用高贵糖果来满足消费者需要的做法，实质上是对消费者不负责任。其后果必然造成大量商品销不出去，大量国家资金被占压，对生产和消费都是不利的。
    现在正值商业淡季，为了迎接秋后商业旺季的到来，国营商业部门应该积极为旺季供应做好准备。各地在组织货源时，必须记取盲目经营的教训，深入了解居民的需要，根据消费者的不同要求，合理地组织和调拨货源，来更好地为生产和消费者服务。
