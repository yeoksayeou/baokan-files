Actively Participate in the Struggle to Eliminate Counter-Revolutionaries
　　Lǐ Guǎngtián
　　The recently published "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" confirms that Hu Feng and many core members of the Hu Feng clique have long been loyal running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. We must learn from this serious event, further recognize the intensification and complexity of class struggle during the transition period, increase our political vigilance a thousandfold, and actively participate in this struggle.
　　Recently, we have studied various relevant documents, listened to reports on denouncing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and held discussion forums. Judging from the speeches at the forums and the feedback from various sources, we are generally insensitive to political trends, lack revolutionary vigilance, and are always behind in the current class struggle, unable to grasp it, or even understand it. This situation is far from conforming to the current stage of the struggle and must be resolutely changed. If we conduct a thorough self-examination, we will certainly find that this is the result of our long-term indifference to politics, and even a general tendency to detach ourselves from politics. As the "People's Daily" commentary on June 10th on the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" points out, our general performance is:
　　First, we often "take the complex class struggle too simply," and have not truly and profoundly recognized the complexity and acuteness of class struggle in theory and practice. Instead, we are indifferent to it, remain calm, or think it has nothing to do with this place, or with schools, or with the education sector, or with ourselves. In fact, the enemy is all-pervasive, and the enemy has "long-term experience in class struggle, and they will engage in various forms of struggle." Wherever the struggle appears weak, it is where they will inevitably attack, especially their long-hidden means of playing double-dealing tactics, which make it easier for us to be fooled.
　　Second, we generally "take care of professional work and forget about politics." Although we often mention the combination of professional work and politics, in practice we only take care of professional work and ignore politics, which further fosters a non-political tendency on the original basis of political weakness, giving the enemy a chance to take advantage of it and allowing counter-revolutionaries to "penetrate" into our "liver."
　　Third, we generally lack a sufficient understanding of the importance and necessity of criticizing bourgeois idealism. The "People's Daily" commentary states: "Some people claim to believe in Marxism-Leninism, but do not attach importance to the struggle to criticize idealism, or say that they have no idealism, or that they have nothing to do with Hu Shi, and therefore prefer to avoid talking about it." This is also our general situation. Perhaps we can add that although we talk about it in words, we do not relate it to reality, especially we cannot correctly relate it to our own actions and thoughts, and therefore cannot go deep, cannot improve, cannot master the weapons to fight against the enemy, and cannot distinguish between right and wrong, and draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy. What is the result? The result is that the enemy's ideology enters from this "gap," and the entry of the enemy's ideology is the condition or precursor for the entry of counter-revolutionaries. The enemy has never relaxed their ideological offensive against us, and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a proof of this.
　　The above is the fact that we have long been indifferent to politics, or even detached from politics, which is one of the reasons why we cannot keep up with the actual struggle or stand outside the struggle, and this is extremely harmful and extremely dangerous.
　　With the unfolding of the struggle to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, the situation has greatly changed. Most comrades have actively participated in this struggle, their understanding has been improved, and they have expressed their attitude, which is very good. But there are also some people who consider themselves to be "mature and prudent." As Comrade Yuan Shuipai's poem published in the "People's Daily" on June 10th says, they believe that "who is right and who is wrong, we have to wait and see." There are also a few people who have made no indication at all. As for those who harbor resistant emotions, although it is an extremely individual phenomenon, it does exist.
　　We demand that everyone actively participate in this struggle. We must all stand on the forefront of the struggle and contribute our strength to thoroughly crushing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all counter-revolutionaries.
　　We must study deeply in the struggle, and relate our studies to our own thoughts and styles, especially we should further recognize the importance and necessity of studying materialism and criticizing idealism.
　　We must realize that it is our bounden duty to consolidate our revolutionary dictatorship and build our great socialist country to actively participate in the struggle against all enemies.

    积极参加清除反革命分子的斗争
  　李广田
    最近公布的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”，证实了胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子很早以来就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗。我们必须从这一严重事件中吸取教训，进一步认识在过渡时期的阶级斗争的尖锐化和复杂化，千百倍地提高我们的政治警惕性，积极地参加这一斗争。
    最近，我们学习了各种有关文件，听了关于声讨胡风反革命集团的报告，并举行了座谈会。从座谈会上的发言以及各方面的反映来看，我们一般地都是政治嗅觉不灵，革命警惕性不高，对于当前的阶级斗争总是赶不上，抓不住，甚至是想不通。这种情形，是远远不符合于现阶段的斗争形势的，必须坚决予以改变。如果深入检查，就一定可以发现，这正是我们长期地不关心政治，甚至一般地有着脱离政治的倾向所造成的结果。这正如六月十日“人民日报”“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”中的按语所指出的，我们一般地表现是：
    第一、我们往往“把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了”，并没有真正从理论上和实际上深刻认识到阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性，反而是漠然视之，泰然处之，或以为同此地无关，或以为同学校无关，或以为同教育界无关，或以为同自己无关。其实敌人是无微不入的，敌人是有着“长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会做各种形式的斗争”，凡是斗争性显得薄弱的地方，就是他们必然要进攻的地方，特别是他们那种长期隐藏着玩弄两面派的手段，更容易使我们上当。
    第二、我们一般地往往是“顾了业务，忘记政治”。我们虽然也常常提到业务同政治相结合，但实际作起来却是只管业务，不管政治，因而就在原来已是政治薄弱的基础上更滋长了非政治的倾向，予敌人以可乘之隙，使反革命分子有“深入到”我们的“肝脏里面”来的可能。
    第三、我们一般地对于批判资产阶级唯心论这一斗争的重要性和必要性的认识极为不够。“人民日报”的按语中说：“有些人口称相信马克思列宁主义，却不重视批判唯心论这一斗争，或者说自己没有唯心论，或者说自己同胡适无关，因而最好避开不谈。”这也正是我们一般的情况。也许还可以补充一点，那就是：口头上尽管谈，但并不联系实际，特别是不能正确地联系自己的行动和思想实际，因而不能深入，不能提高，既不能掌握武器同敌人进行斗争，也不能分辨是非，划清敌我。其结果是什么呢？其结果就是敌人的思想从这个“缺口”打进来，敌人思想的打入就是反革命分子打入的条件或先声。敌人是从来也没有放松过从思想战线上向我们进攻的，胡风反革命集团就是这样的，这就是明证。
    以上这些，就是我们长期以来不关心政治，甚至脱离政治的事实，就是使我们跟不上实际斗争或站在斗争之外的一方面的原因，而这是极端有害，极端危险的。
    随着声讨胡风反革命集团这一斗争的开展，情况已大大改变，大多数同志都积极参加了这一斗争，在认识上已有所提高，而且表示了自己的态度，这是很好的。但也还有一部分人自认为是“老成持重”的，正如六月十日“人民日报”所发表的袁水拍同志的诗里所说的，他们认为“究竟谁是谁非，还得等着瞧”，也还有少数人是毫无表示的，至于怀有抵触情绪的人，虽然是极为个别的现象，但也确是存在的。
    我们要求人人都积极参加这一斗争，我们都要站上斗争的最前线，为彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团和一切反革命分子而贡献自己的力量。
    我们必须在斗争中深入学习，在学习中联系自己的思想和作风，特别是应当进一步认识学习唯物主义批判唯心主义的重要性和必要性。
    我们必须认识到为巩固我们的革命专政，为建设我们伟大的社会主义国家，积极参加对一切敌人的斗争，这是我们的天职。
