Doing a good job in agricultural lending should be assessed from two aspects: one is to issue loans in a timely manner, to the correct recipients, and for proper purposes; the other is to be able to recover them in a timely manner. These are two aspects of the work. Doing the former well can effectively support agricultural production, while doing the latter well can provide a continuous source of support. Currently, summer crops are being harvested, and banks should closely integrate the summer collection of agricultural taxes and the unified purchase of summer grain with the recovery of overdue agricultural loans. Timely recovery of recoverable loans can not only cooperate with the withdrawal of currency and stabilize the market, but also be the main source of replenishing re-lending funds.

When recovering overdue agricultural loans, the most important task is to conduct propaganda and education among farmers. It is necessary to explain to them the principle of "borrowing and repaying" and the importance of "repayment upon maturity," so that they can further recognize the relationship between the state and the farmers. Some staff members believe that after publicizing the general line, the unified purchase and sale of grain, and the implementation of the "three fix" policy, the farmers' awareness has been raised, and they can automatically repay the loans without further publicity and education. This idea is unrealistic. The effect of general propaganda appeals should not be overestimated. In addition to general appeals, it is also necessary to use typical examples to explain the role of loans, calculate the accounts of increased production and interest, and conduct individual education for farmers in light of specific circumstances. In the work, it is necessary to prevent any coercive measures, and to universally explain and resolutely implement the principle of "full recovery for those who can repay in full, partial recovery for those who can repay a part, and permission to extend the term for those who are truly unable to repay." Some comrades dare not publicize these principles to the masses, believing that explaining the policies is detrimental to the work. This is incorrect.

The work of recovering agricultural loans is one of the rural tasks and must be carried out in conjunction with the central work under the unified leadership and arrangement of party committees at all levels. Banks should, based on surveys and pilot projects, formulate loan recovery plans, stipulate work steps and methods, and raise issues that should be paid attention to, and report them to the Party and government for approval in advance, so that the Party and government can lead and arrange. Farmers sell large quantities of grain during the unified purchase period; the work of recovering loans should be closely integrated with the unified purchase work. To this end, banks should understand the steps, methods, time, and regions of the unified purchase in advance. Some farmers sell a portion of their grain before or after the unified purchase; therefore, the work of recovering loans should not be neglected during non-unified purchase periods.

In the work of recovering agricultural loans, efforts should be made to provide convenience to farmers and avoid delaying their time too much. Before recovering agricultural loans, it is necessary to do a good job of checking loan accounts within the bank, calculate the interest, and copy the list of overdue loan accounts, in order to facilitate the smooth progress of the loan recovery work.

Some areas suffered from natural disasters last year, and the repayment ability of farmers has been affected to a certain extent; some agricultural cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individual farmers have borrowed too much in the past, making it difficult to repay in one lump sum; when recovering loans, it is necessary to proceed from reality and stipulate temporary reduced repayment and renewal methods, so as not to cause difficulties in their lives.

In the work of recovering agricultural loans, the power of credit cooperatives should be fully utilized. Entrusting credit cooperatives to recover agricultural loans can not only make up for the shortage of bank manpower, but also has many benefits. Credit cooperatives have close relationships with the masses, are familiar with the situation, and are relatively easy to do this work well. Of course, the working ability of the leading cadres of the credit cooperatives and other conditions must be considered, and it cannot be entrusted across the board; when entrusting, the policies, procedures, and working methods of recovering loans must be clearly explained; during the process of recovering loans, it is also necessary to frequently check and help solve specific difficulties, and oppose the tendency of pushing it out and ignoring it. At the same time, bank staff should also pay attention to helping credit cooperatives develop their business, such as recovering loans, absorbing deposits, and so on.

This year, the summer crops in most areas have had a very good harvest, and farmers have the ability to repay loans. According to surveys in Qingliangsi Township in Nanyang County and Caoli Township in Xingyang County, Henan Province, about 80% of overdue loans can be recovered. After the implementation of the "three fix" policy for grain, the production enthusiasm and political awareness of farmers have been improved, and in general, they are willing to actively repay loans; in particular, members of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups will play an active role in repaying loans. In Sijiazhai Township First Agricultural Cooperative in Huixian County, Henan Province, among the 25 loan households, except for two households that were indeed unable to repay in full, 23 households expressed their willingness to repay in full; many local farmers took the initiative to go to credit cooperatives to check bank loan accounts in preparation for repayment. Since last winter, credit cooperatives have generally developed and can play a greater role as assistants to the National Bank. These are all good conditions for doing a good job of recovering overdue agricultural loans this summer. Bank staff should fully utilize these conditions to do this work well.

    做好夏季收回到期农贷的工作
    郑直方
    农业贷款工作做得好不好，应当从两方面来考察：一方面要发放适时，对象准确，用途正当；另方面要能及时收回。这是一个工作的两个方面。前者做好才能真正有效地扶植农业生产，后者做好才能有继续不断地扶植的力量。目前夏收作物正在收割，银行应当紧密结合农业税夏征和夏粮统购工作，收回到期的农业贷款。及时收回可以收回的贷款，不仅可以配合回笼货币、稳定市场，而且是充实再贷资金力量的主要源泉。
    在收回到期农贷的时候，最重要的工作就是向农民进行宣传教育。要向他们说清楚贷款“有借有还”的道理和“到期即还”的重要性，使他们进一步认清国家和农民的关系。有些工作人员认为经过宣传总路线，粮食统购统销和贯彻“三定”政策以后，农民觉悟提高了，不再宣传教育他们也可以自动还款，这种想法是不合实际的。不能过高地估计一般的宣传号召的效果。除了一般的号召之外，还必须拿一些典型事例，讲解贷款所起的作用，算增产帐、利息帐等，针对具体情况对农民进行个别的教育。在工作中，必须防止任何强迫命令的作法，而要普遍讲解和坚决执行“能偿还完者全部收回，能偿还一部的收回一部，确实无力偿还的允许转期”的原则。有些同志不敢向群众宣传这些原则，认为讲清政策反而对工作不利，这是不对的。
    收回农业贷款的工作是各项农村工作之一，必须在各级党委的统一领导统一安排之下，结合中心工作进行。银行应根据调查和试点等情况，做出收贷计划，规定工作步骤、方法，提出应注意的问题，事先报请党和政府批准，以便党和政府领导和安排。农民大量出售粮食是在统购时期；收回贷款的工作应当和统购工作紧密结合。为此，银行事先要了解统购的步骤、方法、时间和地区。有的农民在统购未开始或统购过后也出售一部分粮食；因此，在非统购时期也不能忽视收回贷款的工作。
    在收回农业贷款的工作中，要力求给农民以方便，不要多耽误农民的时间。在收回农业贷款前，要在银行内部做好贷款帐务核对工作，算好利息，抄好到期贷户清单，以利于收贷工作的顺利进行。
    有些地区去年遭受了自然灾害，农民偿还能力受了一定影响；也有些农业社、互助组和个体农民过去贷款过多，一次难以还清；在收回贷款时要从实际出发，规定暂时少还和转期续贷的办法，以免使他们的生活发生困难。
    在收回农贷的工作中，应当充分运用信用合作社的力量，银行委托信用合作社收回农贷，不但可以弥补银行人力的不足，并且有许多好处。信用合作社和群众关系密切、熟悉情况，比较容易做好这个工作。当然，必须考虑信用社的领导骨干的工作能力等条件，不能一律委托；在委托时必须把收回贷款的政策、手续以及工作方法交代清楚；在收回贷款的过程中还要经常检查，帮助解决具体困难，反对那种推出去不管的偏向。同时，银行工作人员也要注意帮助信用合作社开展业务，如收回贷款、吸收存款，等等。
    今年绝大部分地区夏季作物收成很好，农民有归还贷款能力。据河南南阳县清凉寺乡和荥阳县曹李乡调查，能收回过期到期贷款达百分之八十左右。贯彻粮食“三定”政策以后，农民的生产积极性和政治觉悟提高了，一般说来都愿积极归还贷款；特别是农业合作社员和互助组员，将会在归还贷款中起积极作用。河南辉县司寨乡第一农业合作社，在二十五个贷户中除两户确实无力只归还一部外，有二十三户表示要全部归还；当地不少农民主动找信用合作社查对银行贷款帐，准备还款。信用合作社去冬以来普遍地发展了，能更大地发挥国家银行的助手的作用。这些都是今年夏季做好收回到期农业贷款工作的好条件。银行工作人员应当充分运用这些条件，把这个工作做好。
