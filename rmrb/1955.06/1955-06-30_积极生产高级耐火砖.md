    Actively Produce Advanced Refractory Bricks
    Zhong Han
    In 1954, the Ministry of Heavy Industry designated Anshan Iron and Steel Refractory Material Plant and Guye Refractory Material Plant to trial-produce thermal shock resistant chrome-magnesia bricks and high-alumina bricks. During the trial production process, Soviet experts helped formulate technical operating procedures and trial production work plans. With the close cooperation of scientific research institutions, all employees actively worked hard and gave play to their creativity, and have now successively achieved trial production success.
    These advanced refractory materials, when built into metallurgical furnaces, can greatly extend the life of the furnace body. For example, open-hearth furnace roofs built with thermal shock resistant chrome-magnesia bricks can last one to two times longer than silica brick roofs, and can also increase the thermal load of smelting and shorten the steel smelting time, thereby increasing the output of open-hearth steel by 15 to 30 percent; high-alumina brick linings for open-hearth furnace water jackets can last twice as long as silica brick linings.
    This year, the Ministry of Heavy Industry has further expanded the trial production of advanced refractory materials, and plans to replace all electric furnace roofs, open-hearth furnace water jackets, and the upper checker bricks of regenerators with high-alumina bricks this year. Electric furnaces for smelting high-grade alloy steel will be converted to using thermal shock resistant chrome-magnesia bricks, and high-alumina bricks will be tested for blast furnace linings. Open-hearth furnaces will use a combination of high-alumina bricks and silica bricks for the furnace roofs, which will unlock enormous potential in the steel industry.
    In order to further improve the production of advanced refractory materials, the geological departments need to step up the exploration of chromite-magnesite ore and thoroughly clarify the geological conditions of several key high-alumina bauxite mines to ensure the supply of basic raw materials for the manufacture of chrome-magnesia bricks and high-alumina bricks. Scientific research units need to provide technical guidance to the manufacturing units of advanced refractory bricks.

    积极生产高级耐火砖
    钟汉
    一九五四年，重工业部指定鞍钢耐火材料厂和古冶耐火材料厂试制耐激冷激热性铬镁砖和高铝砖。在试制过程中，苏联专家帮助制定技术操作规程和试制工作计划，取得了科学研究机关的密切配合，全体职工积极努力，发挥了创造性，现在已先后试制成功。
    这些高级耐火材料砌在冶金炉上，可以大大地延长炉体寿命，如耐激冷激热性铬镁砖砌的平炉炉顶较矽砖炉顶寿命可延长一至二倍，并可提高熔炼的热负荷，缩短钢的冶炼时间，因而可提高平炉钢的产量百分之十五到三十；高铝砖的平炉水套较矽砖的可延长寿命二倍。
    今年重工业部进一步扩大了高级耐火材料的试制工作，并计划在今年内把全部电炉炉顶、平炉水套和蓄热室上部用的格子砖都改用高铝砖，将熔炼高级合金钢的电炉改用耐激冷激热性铬镁砖，并试验高炉炉衬采用高铝砖，平炉采用高铝砖和矽砖联合炉顶，这将使钢铁工业发挥巨大的潜力。
    为了进一步改善高级耐火材料的生产，需要地质部门加紧勘探铬镁矿，并彻底搞清几个重点高矾土矿的地质情况，保证制造铬镁砖和高铝砖的基本原料的供应。需要科学研究单位给高级耐火砖的制造单位以技术指导。
