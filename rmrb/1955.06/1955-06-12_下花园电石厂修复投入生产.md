    Xiahuayuan Calcium Carbide Plant Restored and Put Into Production
    The Xiahuayuan Calcium Carbide Plant in Xuanhua City, Hebei Province, which had been severely damaged by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation, has been restored and officially put into production on May 20. This plant is currently the largest local state-owned calcium carbide plant, capable of producing nine tons of calcium carbide per day. The main raw materials required by this plant, such as limestone and electricity, are supplied locally.
    Calcium carbide has many uses in industry. It can be used for welding and cutting metals, manufacturing plastics, insulating materials, nitrogenous fertilizers, and for lighting in mines and other places. (Jin Lianzhen)

    下花园电石厂修复投入生产
    解放以前曾经遭受日本侵略者和国民党反动派严重破坏的河北省宣化市下花园电石厂已经修复，并在五月二十日正式投入生产。这个厂是目前地方国营电石厂中最大的一个，每天可生产九吨电石。这个厂需要的主要原料——石灰石、电力等都由当地供应。
    电石在工业中用途很大，可以用来熔接和熔切金属，制造塑胶、绝缘物质、氮肥等物品，并可在矿山等处用来照明。　（靳连真）
