The national supervisory organs are an important component of the state administrative organs and a powerful weapon for the Party and the state to combat shortcomings and errors in state work. During the period of the state's planned economic construction, the national supervisory organs should concentrate their main efforts, strengthen supervision and inspection of state organs, especially state financial and economic organs and state-owned enterprise departments, strengthen the concept of state workers cherishing state property, strive to implement the policy of "practicing comprehensive thrift and opposing all waste," resolutely oppose all waste, corruption, theft, and damage to state property, and ensure the smooth completion of the state's economic construction tasks. This major task of the current national supervision work has been discussed and decided at the Fourth National Supervision Work Conference in April this year and approved by the State Council's plenary meeting on May 31.

Since the Third National Supervision Work Conference, over the past year, national supervisory organs at all levels have concentrated their efforts and focused on supervising and inspecting the unified purchase and sale of grain and other materials, agricultural production and mutual assistance and cooperation, as well as flood prevention, drainage, and production and disaster relief in rural areas; and have supervised and inspected the supply and storage of materials in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and financial and trade departments. Through these supervisions and inspections, in addition to exposing and handling some workers' irresponsible behavior, lack of concern for the suffering of the masses, coercion and command in their work, as well as corruption, theft, and violations of laws and disciplines, the most noteworthy thing is the exposure of serious waste in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and financial and trade departments, urging and helping these organs and departments improve their work, avoiding large losses of state assets, and playing a particularly significant role in promoting the movement to increase production and practice economy and oppose all waste. According to statistics from the Ministry of Supervision, the supervisory offices of only 44 units under the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Heavy Industry suggested that they reduce unrealistic expenditures in their plans by 10.98 million yuan after reviewing the financial, material, and supply plans of these units. Since 1954, the supervisory organs of 27 provinces and cities, including Hebei, Fujian, and Shanghai, have inspected more than 23,000 grain warehouses and the warehousing and storage work of many commercial departments, saving more than 3.69 billion catties of grain that could have deteriorated or suffered other losses due to heating, moisture, or other factors. These facts show that national supervision work occupies a very important position in ensuring the smooth implementation of the state's economic construction plan.

The above-mentioned achievements of national supervision work are inseparable from the close cooperation of relevant state administrative organs and state-owned enterprise departments. The Ministry of Railways and its subordinate administrations attached importance to promoting the experience of supervision work on the Sino-Soviet railways. The leading personnel of the Ministry of Railways first paid attention to the training and cultivation of cadres, instructed the administrations to transfer a large number of supervisory personnel for training, and gave support and encouragement to the supervisory personnel in their actual work. Therefore, from the beginning of 1954 to November of the same year, a general railway supervision office and 36 people’s supervision offices have been established in 12 railway administrations and one railway bureau. According to statistics from the Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, through prior review and post-event inspection, the supervisory departments at all levels of the railway system have not only helped various units prevent and recover losses of 2.53 million yuan, and prevent over-planned or unplanned expenditures of 510,000 yuan, but also mainly strengthened the workers' concept of cherishing state property, promoted the improvement of business management in various units, established and improved various work systems, and strengthened the planning of financial and material work. For example, under the supervision and support of the supervisory departments, many financial accounting personnel of various business units have improved their sense of responsibility for supervising financial work and have more actively and proactively fought against unreasonable and illegal expenditures. Last year alone, the chief accountants of the Qiqihar Railway Administration refused unreasonable and illegal expenditures of 120,000 yuan.

However, some organs and enterprise departments do not attach importance to supervision work and mistakenly put supervision work in opposition to the work of their own departments, believing that supervision work adds trouble to them and hinders them from exercising their administrative powers. Therefore, they neither transfer cadres to strengthen the supervisory organs, nor do they rarely discuss supervision work. When supervisory personnel encounter obstacles in carrying out their work, they do not provide the necessary support; when there are shortcomings in supervision work, they criticize them in various ways, and even want to take the opportunity to reduce the power of supervision work. They believe that they should enjoy greater power and more "freedom." There are quite a few people with this erroneous idea in state organs and state-owned enterprise departments. In order to smoothly carry out national supervision work in the future, and to prevent state assets from being squandered and wasted, we must resolutely oppose this erroneous idea.

On the part of the national supervisory organs at all levels, in the past few years, the vast majority of supervisory personnel have worked diligently for the country and the people, but there are also some supervisory personnel who have individualistic thoughts of worrying about personal gains and losses and pride. When checking and handling problems, these comrades do not proceed entirely from the interests of the country and the people, but mix in some impure ideological motives. Some people are fond of boasting and seeking quick success, one-sidedly pursuing numbers, thinking that the more inspections and the more problems found, the greater the work achievements, and neglecting the quality of supervision work. Some people have many concerns when checking and handling problems, fearing that offending people will be detrimental to them, and dare not adhere to principles, and dare not resolutely fight against bad people and bad deeds. This makes some supervisory organs inspect many times and find many problems, but they do not often grasp the key points and solve the problems. This also makes some supervisory organs often spend a lot of energy on some minor issues, but neglect the supervision and inspection of major and critical issues. This formalism and lack of strong principles in supervision work is a major aspect of the current shortcomings in supervision work, which makes supervision work unable to meet the needs of the increasingly heavy tasks of national economic construction. On the other hand, there are also a few supervisory personnel who mistakenly regard supervision work as just picking faults, only paying attention to exposing shortcomings in work, and not paying attention to urging and helping the inspected organs and departments to correct shortcomings; or they are subjective and one-sided, put on airs, show off their power, and think they are superior to others when checking and handling problems, causing dissatisfaction among the inspected units and hindering the smooth development of supervision work. Although these are not the main shortcomings of the current supervision work, the consequences it produces are very bad, and therefore it is equally worthy of serious attention from supervisory organs at all levels.

In order to more effectively play the role of national supervision work in guaranteeing the country's economic construction in the future, supervisory organs at all levels must strengthen the political and ideological education of supervisory personnel in light of the above-mentioned problems, strengthen the principles and combat effectiveness of supervisory personnel, and make supervisory personnel themselves models of impartiality and selflessness. In this way, they can have full power not only in form and in law, but also in morality to supervise others. Through such education, every supervisory worker must also recognize that supervision work is the most mass-based work, and without the active support and assistance of the broad masses, it is impossible to timely discover and correct the shortcomings and problems in national work, especially national economic construction work. Therefore, in addition to maintaining close contact and cooperation with the Party's Supervisory Committee and mass organizations, supervisory organs at all levels must also frequently go deep into the masses, listen attentively to the voices of the masses, and especially seriously treat the people's letters and visits, and give strong support to the people's just struggle. In the past year, supervisory organs at all levels received more than 265,000 letters from the masses, which played a great role in helping supervisory organs better understand the situation and more effectively combat bad people and bad deeds. However, today some supervisory organs are still tainted with the old bureaucratic bad habits, and they do not handle the masses' reports and accusations in a timely and serious manner, shirking responsibilities to each other, forwarding them at each level, and even accumulating them for a long time without processing them. This decadent bureaucratic style is absolutely incompatible with the nature and task of supervisory organs, and if it is not overcome in time, it will affect the prestige of supervisory organs among the masses and hinder supervisory organs from closely contacting the masses.

In the past, the dispersed structure of the supervisory organs, the lack of concentrated strength, and the lack of unified authority were also an important reason why the supervisory organs failed to fully play their role. The recently held Fourth National Supervision Work Conference decided to clearly divide the responsibilities of the national supervisory organs and the internal supervisory organs of the various departments of the State Council, and the establishment of the national supervisory organs will be uniformly controlled by the Ministry of Supervision, and all the expenses of the national supervisory organs will be paid by the national treasury, in order to achieve the effect of unifying authority and concentrating the use of strength. This decision has been approved by the State Council. This major measure will help to further strengthen the national supervisory organs and further play the role of national supervision work. Supervisory organs at all levels should strengthen the organizational construction of supervision work in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations and in accordance with Lenin's principle of "better fewer, but better." State organs and state-owned enterprise departments at all levels should also give the necessary assistance to the supervisory organs, and should never relax their assistance and support to the supervision work because of these changes in the organizational form of the supervisory organs, let alone produce antagonistic emotions. Party committees at all levels should also strengthen their leadership over the supervisory organs in a practical rather than empty manner, and frequently care about and guide their work, so that the supervisory organs can fully play their role in supervising and inspecting the implementation of the national construction plan and in the struggle to practice comprehensive thrift and oppose all waste.

### 积极发挥国家监察工作在反浪费斗争中的作用

    积极发挥国家监察工作在反浪费斗争中的作用
    国家监察机关是国家行政管理机关的一个重要组成部分，是党和国家用来同国家工作中的缺点和错误作斗争的一个有力武器。在国家有计划的经济建设时期，国家监察机关应该集中主要力量，加强对国家机关、特别是国家财经机关和国营企业部门的监督和检查，加强国家工作人员爱护国家财产的观念，努力贯彻“厉行全面节约，反对一切浪费”的方针，坚决反对一切浪费、贪污、盗窃和损坏国家财产的行为，保证国家经济建设任务的顺利完成。当前国家监察工作这一重大任务，已经今年四月第四次全国监察工作会议讨论决定，并由五月三十一日国务院全体会议批准。
    第三次全国监察工作会议以来，一年来，各级国家监察机关集中力量，有重点地对农村的粮食等物资的统购统销、农业生产和互助合作以及防汛排涝和生产救灾等工作进行了监督和检查，对国营工矿企业和财经贸易部门的物资供应和保管工作进行了监督和检查。通过这些监督和检查，除揭发和处理了一些工作人员不负责任、不关心群众疾苦、在工作中强迫命令以及贪污盗窃和违法乱纪等行为以外，最值得注意的，是揭发了国营工矿企业和财经贸易部门中严重的浪费情况，督促和帮助这些机关和部门改进了工作，避免了国家资财的大量损失，对于推动增产节约运动、反对一切浪费现象，起了特别重大的作用。据监察部的统计，仅纺织工业部、第二机械工业部和重工业部所属四十四个单位的监察室，由于对这些单位的财务、材料和供应计划作了审查，就建议他们削减了计划中不切合实际的开支达一千零九十八万元。河北、福建和上海等二十七个省、市的监察机关，一九五四年以来对两万三千多个粮食仓库和许多商业部门的仓储保管工作作了检查，挽救了三十六亿九千多万斤因发热、发潮而有可能霉烂变质或遭受其他损失的粮食。这些事实说明，在保证国家经济建设计划的顺利实施上，国家监察工作占着一个很重要的地位。
    国家监察工作能够获得上述成绩，是同有关国家行政机关和国营企业部门的密切合作分不开的。铁道部及其所属各管理局重视推行中长铁路监察工作经验，铁道部的领导工作人员首先注意了干部的训练和培养，指示各管理局抽调了大批监察工作人员进行训练，并在实际工作中给了监察工作人员以支持和鼓励。因此，从一九五四年初到同年十一月，已在十二个铁路管理局、一个铁路局成立了铁路总监察和三十六个人民监察室。据铁道部监察局统计，一年来铁路系统的各级监察部门通过事先审核和事后检查，除帮助各单位防止和挽回损失二百五十三万元，防止超计划开支或者无计划开支五十一万元以外，主要是加强了工作人员爱护国家财产的观念，推动各单位改善了经营管理，建立和健全了各种工作制度，加强了财务、材料工作的计划性。例如在监察部门的督促和支持下，各业务单位的财务会计工作人员，很多都提高了监督财务工作的责任心，更积极更主动地同不合理、不合法的开支作斗争。仅齐齐哈尔铁路管理局各总会计，去年一年内拒绝的不合理的和不合法的开支即达十二万元。
    但是，也有一些机关和企业部门不重视监察工作，错误地把监察工作同本部门的工作对立起来，认为监察工作给他们增添了麻烦，妨碍了他们行使行政职权。所以，既不抽调干部充实监察机构，也很少讨论监察工作。在监察人员为开展工作碰到阻碍的时候，不给予必要的支持；在监察工作有了缺点的时候，便多方加以责难，甚至想乘机缩小监察工作的权力。他们认为自己应该享有更大的权力和更多的“自由”。有这种错误思想的人，在国家机关和国营企业部门中是相当多的。为了在今后顺利地开展国家监察工作，为了使国家的资财不被糟蹋掉和浪费掉，我们必须坚决反对这种错误思想。
    在各级国家监察机关方面，几年来，绝大多数的监察工作人员都是勤勤恳恳地为国家和为人民工作，但是也还有一部分监察工作人员有患得患失的个人主义思想和骄傲情绪。这些同志在检查和处理问题的时候，不是完全从国家和人民的利益出发，而是多少夹杂着一些不纯的思想动机。有的人好大喜功，片面追求数字，以为检查的次数多，发现的问题不少，工作成绩就大，忽视了监察工作的质量。有的人在检查处理问题时顾虑多端，深怕得罪了人对自己不利，不敢坚持原则，不敢坚决同坏人坏事作斗争。这就使得某些监察机关虽然检查的次数很多，发现的问题也不少，但是真正抓住要害、解决问题的时候并不多。这也使得某些监察机关往往在一些次要的问题上花费了很多精力，但是忽略了对重大的、关键性问题的监察和检查。监察工作上的这种形式主义和缺乏坚强的原则性，是当前监察工作缺点的一个主要方面，它使得监察工作还不能适应日益繁重的国家经济建设任务的需要。另一方面，也还有少数监察工作人员，错误地把监察工作当成只是找岔子，只注意揭发工作中的缺点，不注意督促和帮助被检查的机关和部门改正缺点；或者是在检查处理问题的时候主观片面，摆架子，耍威风，自以为高人一等，引起被检查单位的不满，妨碍了监察工作的顺利开展。这些虽然不是当前监察工作的主要缺点，但是它产生的后果是很不好的，因而同样值得各级监察机关严重注意。
    为了在今后更有效地发挥国家监察工作在保证国家经济建设上的作用，各级监察机关必须针对上述的问题，加强对监察工作人员的政治思想教育，加强监察工作人员的原则性和战斗性，使监察工作人员本身成为公正无私的模范。这样，他们才能不仅在形式上，在法律上，而且在道德上有充分的权力去监察别人。通过这样的教育，还必须使每一个监察工作人员认识到，监察工作是群众性最强的工作，没有广大群众的积极支持和赞助，它就不可能及时发现和纠正国家工作，特别是国家经济建设工作中的缺点和问题。因此，各级监察机关除应同党的监察委员会和群众团体取得密切联系、互相配合以外，还必须经常深入群众，虚心倾听群众的呼声，特别是要认真地对待人民的来信和来访，给予群众的正义斗争以有力的支持。在过去的一年中，各级监察机关收到群众来信二十六万五千多件，这对于监察机关更好地了解情况，更加有效地打击坏人坏事，是起了很大作用的。但是今天还有一些监察机关沾染了旧的官场恶习，对群众的检举和控告处理不及时，不认真，互相推托，层层抄转，甚至长期积压不作处理。这种腐朽的官僚主义作风是同监察机关的性质和任务绝不相容的，如不及时加以克服，就会影响监察机关在群众中的威信，妨害监察机关密切联系群众。
    过去，监察机关的机构分散，力量不集中，事权不统一，也是监察机关未能充分发挥作用的一个重要原因。最近召开的第四次全国监察工作会议，决定将国家监察机关同国务院各部门的内部监察机关的职责加以明确的划分，并将国家监察机关的编制由监察部统一掌握，国家监察机关的经费全部由国家财政开支，以收统一事权和集中使用力量的效果。这一决定已经国务院批准。这个重大的措施有助于进一步加强国家监察机关，有助于进一步发挥国家监察工作的作用。各级国家监察机关应根据上述的规定，本着列宁的“宁肯少些，但要好些”的原则，切实加强监察工作的组织建设。各级国家机关和国营企业部门也应该给予监察机关以必要的协助，绝不应因为监察机关组织形式上的这些改变就放松对监察工作的帮助和支持，更不应产生对立的情绪。各级党委也应该切实地而不是徒托空言地加强对监察机关的领导，经常关怀和指导他们的工作，使监察机关在为监督和检查国家建设计划的贯彻执行，为厉行全面节约、反对一切浪费的斗争中充分发挥它的作用。
