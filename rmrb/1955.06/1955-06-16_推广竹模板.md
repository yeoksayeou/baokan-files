    Promoting Bamboo Formwork
    Li Shengting
    The Sixth Engineering Division of the Henan Provincial Construction Engineering Company successfully experimented with bamboo as formwork in April this year, saving a significant amount of timber. In the past, China has consistently used wooden concrete formwork, consuming a large quantity of timber annually, which, due to the high cost of wood, increased engineering costs. Using bamboo formwork has many advantages:
    1. Low cost and low loss rate. According to the Henan Provincial Construction Engineering Company's experiments, the cost of bamboo formwork is 3.30 yuan lower per square meter than that of wooden formwork, and the loss cost per square meter of bamboo formwork is more than 0.50 yuan lower than that of wooden formwork. In 20 square meters of formwork, more than 76 yuan can be saved.
    2. Bamboo material has a smooth surface, is solid in texture, and has a very low water absorption rate, which helps with the curing of concrete. Bamboo formwork is also easy to remove, without affecting the quality of the concrete due to demolding.
    3. Bamboo formwork can fully utilize short and split bamboo left over from manufacturing bamboo scaffolding and bamboo sheds. Using these waste bamboo materials to manufacture formwork will not affect the quality of the formwork.
    Currently, China has limited experience in using bamboo formwork. Before use, mechanical calculations should be performed, and the joists should be appropriately increased or decreased according to the different conditions of each project to avoid quality accidents and waste.

    推广竹模板
    李圣庭
    河南省建筑工程公司第六工程处今年四月试用竹料作模型板成功，节约了大量木材。过去我国一直是使用木料的混凝土模板，每年使用的木材数量很大，而且由于木材较贵，增加了工程成本。使用竹模板，优点是很多的：
    一、成本低廉，损耗率小。根据河南省建筑工程公司的试验证明，竹模板每平方公尺较木模板的成本低三元三角，每平方公尺竹模板的损耗价较木模板低五角以上，在二十平方公尺的模板中，就可节省七十六元以上。
    二、竹材表面光滑，质地坚实，吸水率很低，有助于混凝土的养护。竹模板拆除也方便，不致因拆模而影响混凝土的质量。
    三、可以充分利用制造竹脚手架和竹工棚所剩下的短材和裂竹制造竹模板。用这些废竹材制造模板不会影响模板的质量。
    目前我国使用竹模板的经验还不多，在使用前应该经过力学计算，根据每项工程的不同情况适当增减龙骨，以免发生质量事故和造成浪费。
