Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 3rd, TASS dispatch: "Pravda" published an editorial on June 3rd entitled "Striving for Further Consolidation of Soviet-Yugoslav Cooperation, Striving for Lasting Peace in the World!" commenting on the Declaration signed by the Soviet Government and the Yugoslav Government on June 2nd in Belgrade.

The editorial said that the declaration, which marks the successful conclusion of the talks, is a document of great international significance. The period during which the good relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia were damaged is a thing of the past. Both sides have expressed their willingness to resolutely abandon old grievances and eliminate all obstacles hindering the complete normalization of relations between the two countries and the development of friendly relations between the two peoples. The Soviet public agrees with and supports the mission of the Soviet government delegation to Yugoslavia, and they expressed the firm hope that the Belgrade talks will lead to the development and consolidation of political, economic and cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, which in turn will strengthen world peace. The warm and friendly reception given to the Soviet delegation by the people of Yugoslavia significantly demonstrates that the working people of Yugoslavia also hold this hope. The hopes of the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples have not been disappointed.

As a result of discussions held in a spirit of friendship at the highest level on pressing issues in Soviet-Yugoslav relations, major principles have been put forward to guide the two governments in handling international affairs, common views have been determined on resolving pressing issues, and principles have been formulated as the basis for further consolidating friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

After stating the principles announced in the declaration, "Pravda" pointed out: The declaration firmly proves that the Soviet Government and the Yugoslav Government have reached a common agreement on all important issues related to the international situation and Soviet-Yugoslav relations, and have laid a firm and sound foundation for expanding and consolidating the friendship of our fraternal peoples.

The significance of this fact, which the whole world understands, cannot be overestimated.

The complete normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is of great significance not only for the two countries, but also for world peace and the international labor movement. This is why the peace-loving public of all countries has followed the progress of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks with great concern and sympathy. News that the talks were conducted in a spirit of complete mutual understanding was warmly welcomed by all countries in the camp of peace and democracy and by peace fighters around the world.

Everyone knows that hostile elements wanted to take advantage of the damaged good relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The enemies of peace, the enemies of the working class, wanted to gain huge political capital from these differences. The declaration published today naturally means the failure of this hope. This is why the reactionary American newspapers have long been issuing vicious cries about the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks. The imperialists and their agents recognize that despite all their intrigues, the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples will continue to expand and strengthen.

The Soviet public expresses its deep conviction that the joint decisions taken by the governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia will lead to the further development and consolidation of comprehensive cooperation between the two peoples. This cooperation possesses all the conditions - the centuries-old friendship between our two peoples, the glorious traditions of their revolutionary movements, the necessary economic foundation and the unity of ideals in the struggle for human peace, prosperity and happiness.

We cannot fail to point out that the expansion and strengthening of Soviet-Yugoslav cooperation is of the utmost importance to the entire international working class movement. The consolidation of relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia is in the interests of the working class of all countries.

Finally, there is no doubt that the expansion of Soviet-Yugoslav cooperation will have a beneficial effect on the international situation. Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is conducive to creating an atmosphere of trust in relations between countries, and will therefore help to ease international tensions and strengthen world peace.

"Pravda" concluded by saying that this is why the Soviet people wholeheartedly welcome the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks. They firmly support the wise policy of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Government in creatively applying the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism.

    “真理报”发表社论评论苏南两国政府宣言
    新华社三日讯　塔斯社莫斯科三日电：“真理报”三日发表了一篇题为“争取苏南合作的进一步巩固，争取全世界的持久和平！”的社论，评论苏联政府和南斯拉夫政府六月二日在贝尔格莱德签署的宣言。
    社论说，标志着会谈的圆满结束的这个宣言，是一项具有巨大国际意义的文件。苏联和南斯拉夫的良好关系被破坏的时期，是一件过去的事情了。双方已经表示它们愿意坚决抛弃旧嫌并消除妨碍两国关系完全正常化和两国人民友好关系的发展的一切障碍。苏联公众赞同并支持赴南斯拉夫的苏联政府代表团的使命，他们表示了这种坚定的希望：贝尔格莱德谈判将导致苏联和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国之间的政治、经济和文化合作的发展和巩固，而这又将加强世界和平。南斯拉夫人民给予苏联代表团的热烈友好的接待，显著地表明了南斯拉夫劳动人民也抱着这种希望。事实证明苏联人民和南斯拉夫人民的希望并没有被辜负。
    由于本着友好精神在最高级举行的关于苏南关系的迫切问题的讨论的结果，已经提出了指导两国政府处理国际事务的重大原则，确定了关于解决迫切问题的共同观点，制定了作为进一步巩固苏联和南斯拉夫的友好与合作的基础的原则。
      “真理报”在陈述了宣言中所宣布的原则后指出：宣言确凿地证明：苏联政府和南斯拉夫政府在有关国际局势和苏南关系的一切重要问题上达成了共同协议后，已为扩大和巩固我们兄弟般的人民的友谊奠定了坚定和健全的基础。
    对于这个全世界都明白的事实的重要意义，是怎样估计也不为过高的。
    苏联和南斯拉夫之间的关系的完全正常化，不但对于两国具有重大意义，而且对于世界和平和国际劳工运动也具有重大意义。各国爱好和平的公众所以抱着十分关心和同情的心情注视着苏南会谈的进展，原因就在这里。消息传来说，会谈是本着互相完全谅解的精神进行的。这一消息受到和平和民主阵营的一切国家和全世界的和平战士的热烈欢迎。
    人人都知道，敌对分子想要利用苏南良好关系遭到破坏的局面。和平的敌人，工人阶级的敌人，想要从这些分歧中间取得巨大的政治资本，今天公布的宣言很自然地意味着这种希望的落空。这就是美国反动报纸老早就对苏南会谈的结果发出毒恶叫嚣的原因。帝国主义者和他们的代理人认识到，尽管他们玩弄种种阴谋，苏联和南斯拉夫人民之间的友谊和合作仍然要扩大和加强。
    苏联公众都表示深深相信，苏联和南斯拉夫两国政府所联合采取的决定将导向两国人民全面合作的进一步发展和巩固。这种合作具备一切条件——我们两国人民的历时若干世纪的友谊，他们的革命运动的光荣传统，必要的经济基础和在争取人类和平、繁荣和幸福的斗争中的理想的一致。
      我们不能不指出，苏南合作的扩大和加强，对整个国际工人阶级运动具有最重大的意义。苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国之间的关系的巩固，是符合于一切国家的工人阶级的利益的。
    最后，毋容怀疑，苏南合作的扩大将对国际局势产生有利影响。苏联和南斯拉夫之间的合作有利于在国与国的关系上创造信任的气氛，因此，将有助于缓和国际紧张局势和加强世界和平。
        “真理报”最后说，苏联人民所以衷心地欢迎苏南会谈的结果，原因就在这里。他们坚定地拥护创造性地运用马克思—列宁主义的不朽学说的苏联共产党和苏联政府的英明政策。
