Trade union delegations from various countries who were invited to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations and visit have successively left China to return to their countries. Before leaving or while passing through Hong Kong, they issued written statements or gave talks, discussing their impressions of visiting China.

    All-German Trade Union Delegation

The All-German Trade Union Delegation issued a statement before leaving Beijing on May 27, saying that their visit would further consolidate the friendly relations that already exist between the German and Chinese people. During their visit, they were moved to see the Chinese people happily working to fulfill the tasks put forward by the Party and the government.

The statement said that the delegation is convinced that the Chinese people deeply love peace. Precisely because of this, the Chinese people must resolutely liberate Taiwan. Because Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and today, under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and American imperialism, Taiwan has become a base of aggression threatening peace. Whether in Asia or Europe, the enemy threatening the peace, independence, and lives of the German and Chinese people is the same: American imperialism and its allies.

    Albanian Trade Union Delegation

The head of the Albanian Trade Union Delegation, Pirostris, made a statement to the Albanian News Agency after returning to Albania. He said that it was the first time that the Albanian Trade Union Delegation had traveled to the People's Republic of China. Everywhere we went, we received a warm, sincere, and friendly welcome, which showed the great love of the Chinese people for our country. He said that the grand "May Day" demonstration in Beijing is something we will never forget. It is an expression of the will and determination of the people of New China to build their beautiful motherland and liberate Taiwan, and it is an expression of support for friendship and international cooperation and the defense of world peace. We saw this will and determination everywhere in all the factories, schools, towns, and villages we visited.

    Indian Trade Union Representative

The head of the All-India Trade Union Congress delegation, Jyoti Basu, told reporters in Hong Kong on May 29 that it was a good opportunity to have trade union representatives from Asian and African countries gather in Beijing for an informal meeting to discuss matters of common concern, such as peace and war (referring to the Asian-African Trade Union Conference held in Beijing). He said these things are of vital importance to the entire working class, and pointed out that the significance of this symposium should not be underestimated.

Indian trade union representative B.K. Mukherjee told reporters in Hong Kong on May 27 regarding the Taiwan issue: "Taiwan should belong to China, and China must recover it. It is wrong for the United States to interfere in this matter." Mukherjee also said that the Chinese people demand genuine peace. For the sake of construction, peace is a truly indispensable need for them. I have no doubt that they truly intend to establish lasting peace.

    Burmese Trade Union Representative

The head of the Trade Union Congress (Burma) delegation, Bo Maung Gale, said in Hong Kong on May 29 that the main items discussed by the trade union representatives of Asian and African countries were colonialism, atomic weapons, and the maintenance of peace. He said that the Burmese delegation hopes for world peace and opposes the use of atomic weapons. He also said that most of the representatives were against colonialism, which means domination over other countries.

    Indonesian Trade Union Delegations

The Indonesian Trade Union Delegation issued a statement in Hong Kong on May 31. The statement said: "The entire Chinese people, led by the working class, are strongly united in building their country. The Chinese people are very eager to live in friendship and peace with other countries, and the education of the new generation clearly demonstrates this."

The head of the Indonesian General Labor Union Delegation, Joko Suyono, said: "China's construction is to make the Chinese people happier. China is not preparing for war."

    Japanese Workers' Delegation to China

The head of the Japanese Workers' Delegation to China, Minoru Takano, told reporters in Hong Kong on May 30 about his impressions of visiting China: China's construction is underway. This is just the beginning, and it is believed that better conditions will soon be created for the happy life of the 600 million Chinese people.

He said that he saw with his own eyes how the Chinese people participated in the construction of the new society, and what impressed him deeply was the strong patriotism shown by the Chinese people in the construction.

Finally, Takano expressed his hope that diplomatic relations between China and Japan would be restored at an early date, and that the people of China and Japan would strengthen their ties with each other. He said that mutual visits between the people of the two countries are helpful in promoting relations between the two countries.

    French Trade Union Delegation

The nine representatives of the French Trade Union Delegation wrote a letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on May 29 before returning to France to express their gratitude. In the letter, they said: The French representatives affirmed and praised the struggle of the Chinese people and their government to safeguard peace. They support the determination of the Chinese people to recover their own territory – Taiwan. The French trade union representatives also condemned the American imperialists for using Taiwan as an aggressive stronghold to threaten world peace in the letter.

The French trade union representatives were pleased with the many meetings with representatives of trade union organizations from various countries during their visit to China, and hoped that such contacts could continue in the future. They wished the Chinese people great achievements in their struggle to build socialism.

The letter concluded: The French trade union representatives promised to tell everyone everything they had seen, promised to work hard to restore Sino-French cultural and trade exchanges, and to work to urge the French government to recognize People's China.

    Australian Trade Union Delegation

The Australian Trade Union Delegation jointly issued a written statement before leaving Beijing, saying that they saw that the Chinese government regards the maximum material, social, and cultural welfare of the people as the overall guiding principle. The statement pointed out that those in charge of leadership work in various places have a spirit of self-criticism and are willing to accept any suggestions for improving their work. The representatives believed that the new China is willing to live in a peaceful environment and is willing to trade with other countries in the world on an equal footing.

The statement finally expressed the hope that Australian trade unions would send delegations to China in the future to promote relations between the Australian and Chinese people and world peace. The representatives will do their best to urge the Australian government to accept the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different economic systems and recognize the Chinese government.

    New Zealand Trade Union Representative

The New Zealand weekly "People's Voice" reported on June 1 that New Zealand trade union representative Mackie, who had recently returned from China after being invited to attend the "May Day" celebrations, said: He went to all the places he wanted to go. He also said that in all the places he went, the Chinese people showed their desire to be friendly with foreign people. Mackie said that China is a country with religious freedom. He also brought back crosses presented by two Chinese priests to a leader of a Catholic veterans' group who asked him to investigate the religious freedom situation in China.

Another New Zealand trade union representative who was invited to visit China, Frank Langley, secretary of the New Zealand Carpenters and Joiners Union, said that the progress of urban construction in China has reached an almost unbelievable level. (Xinhua News Agency)

    各国工会代表团谈访问我国的感想
    应邀来我国参加“五一”节观礼和访问的各国工会代表团已经先后离开我国返国。他们在离开时或则途经香港时发表了书面声明或谈话，谈到了他们访问我国的观感。
    全德国工会代表团
    全德国工会代表团在五月二十七日离京前发表声明说：他们这次的访问将更加巩固德中两国人民之间已经存在的友好关系。他们在访问期间，感动地看到中国人民在愉快地为实现党和政府所提出的任务而劳动。
    声明说，代表团确信中国人民是深切爱好和平的。正因为如此，所以中国人民一定要坚决解放台湾。因为台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，而今天在蒋介石集团和美帝国主义统治下，台湾变成了威胁和平的侵略基地。无论在亚洲或欧洲，威胁着和平、独立和德中两国人民生活的敌人是一个，那就是美帝国主义和它的同盟者。
    阿尔巴尼亚工会代表团
    阿尔巴尼亚工会代表团团长皮里斯特里返国后向阿尔巴尼亚通讯社记者发表谈话。他说，阿尔巴尼亚工会代表团赴中华人民共和国旅行，这还是第一次。我们所到之处，受到热烈、诚挚和友好的欢迎，这种欢迎表现出伟大的中国人民对我们国家的热爱。他说，在北京举行的盛大的“五一”节示威游行，是我们绝不会忘记的。它是新中国人民要建设他们美丽的祖国和解放台湾的意志和决心的表示，它是赞成友好和国际合作及保卫世界和平的表示。我们在我们访问过的一切工厂、学校、市镇和乡村中，到处都看见这种意志和决心。
    印度工会代表
    全印总工会代表团团长乔蒂·巴苏五月二十九日在香港对报界发表谈话说，有这样一个机会（指在北京举行的亚洲非洲工会座谈会）使亚非国家的工会代表们在北京聚集一堂，非正式地开会讨论像和平和战争这种共同有关的事情，是很好的。他说这些事情对全体工人阶级都是切身有关的，并指出决不能低估这次座谈会的意义。
    印度工会代表比·库·慕克吉五月二十七日在香港向记者们谈到台湾问题说：“台湾应该属于中国，中国必须收复它。美国在这个问题上进行干涉是错误的。”慕克吉还说，中国人民要求真正的和平。为了建设，和平对他们来说乃是真正的不可缺少的需要。我毫不怀疑他们真正地打算建立持久和平。
    缅甸工会代表
    工会大会（缅甸）代表团团长波貌格礼五月二十九日在香港说，亚非国家工会代表们讨论的主要项目是殖民主义、原子武器和维护和平等问题。他说，缅甸代表团希望世界和平并反对使用原子武器。他又说，大多数代表都是反对殖民主义的，殖民主义意味着支配其他国家。
    印度尼西亚各工会代表团
    印度尼西亚工会代表团五月三十一日在香港发表了一个声明。声明中说：“由工人阶级领导的全体中国人民坚强地团结在一起建设他们的国家。中国人民非常希望同其他国家友好和和平共处，新一代的教育明显地表明了这种情形。”
    印度尼西亚总工会代表团团长约柯苏约诺说：“中国的建设是为了使中国人民更加幸福。中国不是在准备战争”。
    日本工人访华代表团
    日本工人访华代表团团长高野实五月三十日在香港对记者发表访华观感说：中国的建设正在进行中。这还只是开始，相信不久以后就能为六亿中国人民的幸福生活创造更好条件。
    他说，他这次亲眼看到了中国人民怎样参加了新社会的建设，给予他深刻印象的是中国人民在建设中所表现的强烈的爱国主义精神。
    高野实最后表示希望中日两国邦交早日恢复，并希望中日两国人民加强彼此间的联系。他说，两国人民的互相访问，对促进两国间关系是有帮助的。
    法国工会代表团
    法国工会代表团九位代表在五月二十九日返国前写信给中华全国总工会表示感谢。他们在信中说：法国代表们肯定和赞扬中国人民及其政府为维护和平而进行的斗争。他们支持中国人民要求收复自己的领土——台湾的决心。法国工会代表在信中并谴责美帝国主义者正以台湾作为侵略据点来威胁世界和平。
    法国工会代表对在访问中国期间和各国工会组织代表的多次会晤感到欣慰，希望以后能继续有这样的接触，并祝中国人民在建设社会主义的斗争中取得巨大的成就。
    这封信最后说：法国工会代表保证把他们所看到的一切告诉所有的人，保证努力争取恢复中法文化和贸易交流，并且致力于促使法国政府承认人民中国。
    澳大利亚工会代表团
    澳大利亚工会代表团在离京前联合发表书面声明说：他们看到了中国政府把人民的物质、社会和文化上的最大限度的福利作为总的指导原则。声明指出各地担负领导工作的人都有自我批评的精神，愿意接受任何改进工作的建议。代表们相信新中国愿意在和平环境中生活，并愿在平等基础上和世界上其他国家进行贸易。
    声明最后表示希望澳大利亚工会今后将为增进澳中两国人民的关系和世界和平而派代表团来华，代表们将尽全力促使澳大利亚政府接受不同经济制度国家和平共处的原则和承认中国政府。
    新西兰工会代表
    六月一日的新西兰周报“人民之声报”报道，最近应邀到中国参加“五一”节观礼归来的新西兰工会代表马基说：他到了他想到的各处地方。他又说，在他所到的各处地方，中国人们都显示了他们同外国人民友好的愿望。马基说，中国是有宗教自由的国家。他并且给一位要求他调查中国宗教自由情况的天主教退伍军人团体的领袖带回了两位中国神甫所赠送的十字架。
    另一位应邀访问中国的新西兰工会代表、新西兰木工与细木工工会书记弗兰克·朗格莱说，中国城市建设的进展达到了几乎令人难以相信的程度。  （据新华社讯）
