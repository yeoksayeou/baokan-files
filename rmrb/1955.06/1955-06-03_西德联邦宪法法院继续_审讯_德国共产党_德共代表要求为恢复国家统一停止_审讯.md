Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 2nd. According to a report from the German News Agency in Karlsruhe: The West German Federal Constitutional Court continued its "trial" of the German Communist Party on May 31st. Long before the court session began, the Bonn authorities had filled the streets near the courthouse with police.

    The German Communist Party's legal representative, Krüger, first made a motion at the opening of the session demanding that the "trial" be stopped. He said: The German Communist Party has pointed out more than once that the "trial" of the German Communist Party is incompatible with the declaration in the preamble of the Bonn Constitution regarding the rapid restoration of German unity. The German Communist Party has repeatedly requested that the "trial" be stopped because doing so would hinder unity and increase the difficulty of restoring national unity. He also said: "The political developments since the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty have proven the correctness of the German Communist Party's policies. The real possibility of solving the German question exists. The Austrian example proves that there is only one path to achieving peaceful reunification: the abolition of the Paris Agreements, the establishment of a pan-European collective security system, and the holding of free all-German elections."

    The German Communist Party's other legal representative, Bemer, also made a motion demanding the cancellation of the illegal arrest warrants for German Communist Party leaders Lehmann, Reiche, and Ladevin.

    Both motions were unreasonably rejected by the court.

    Because the court was unable to find any basis for accusing the German Communist Party of violating the constitution in the previous "trials," it turned to attempting to search for "evidence" that could harm the German Communist Party in the documents of the National Front of Democratic Germany, in the speeches of the heads of government of the German Democratic Republic, in the resolutions of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and in the statements of Max Reimann. To this end, the court actually quoted passages from the aforementioned documents and statements for three hours during the "trial" on May 31st.

    The "trial" will continue on the 1st.

    西德联邦宪法法院继续“审讯”德国共产党
    德共代表要求为恢复国家统一停止“审讯”
    新华社柏林二日电　据德意志通讯社加尔斯卢合消息：西德联邦宪法法院五月三十一日继续“审讯”德国共产党。开庭以前很久波恩当局就在法院附近的街道上布满了警察。
    德国共产党的法律代表克吕格尔在开庭时首先提出动议，要求停止“审讯”。他说：德国共产党曾不止一次地指出，“审讯”德国共产党是同波恩宪法绪言中关于迅速恢复德国统一的宣告不相符的。德国共产党所以多次要求停止“审讯”，是因为这样做将妨害统一和增加恢复国家统一的困难。他又说：“奥地利国家条约缔结以来的政治发展证明了德国共产党政策的正确性。解决德国问题的现实可能性是存在着的。奥地利的例子证明，要达到和平统一只有一条道路，这就是：取消巴黎协定、建立全欧集体安全体系和举行全德自由选举。”
    德国共产党的另一法律代表贝麦尔也提出动议，要求取消对德国共产党的领导人雷曼、雷熙和莱德温的非法逮捕令。
    这两个动议都遭到法庭的无理拒绝。
    由于法庭在以往进行的“审讯”中无法从德国共产党的纲领中找出所谓违反宪法的根据，它就转而企图从民主德国全国阵线的文件中、从德意志民主共和国政府负责人的演说、德国统一社会党的决议以及马克斯·雷曼的言论中来搜寻可以加害于德国共产党的“证据”。为了这个目的，法庭方面竟在五月三十一日的“审讯”中摘引上述文件和言论中的章句达三小时之久。
    “审讯”将在一日继续进行。
