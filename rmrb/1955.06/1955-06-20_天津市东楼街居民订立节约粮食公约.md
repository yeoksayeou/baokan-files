    Residents of Donglou Street in Tianjin's Sixth District, having received education on conserving food, saw 80 percent of households establish a convention for conserving food. According to an inspection by the Sixth District People's Committee, Donglou Street has become a street with relatively good results in conserving food.
    The various residents' committees and Party propagandists of Donglou Street have adopted methods such as holding discussion meetings, reading newspapers, and conducting family visits to publicize the significance of conserving food to the residents. Among the more than 14,000 people in the entire street, more than 7,500 people directly heard reports and publicity, and housewives from each household participated in the discussion meetings.
    The residents have earnestly implemented the food conservation convention. Many families have carefully and practically formulated grain purchase plans, buying only what they eat each month. Women are paying attention to reducing leftover food waste. In the past, dirty water pools in various hutongs and alleyways often contained food such as noodles, rice, and窩頭 (wōtóu, a type of corn bread), but now they are no longer seen. Households raising chickens and ducks are using rice bran, tofu dregs, and other items to replace grain as chicken and duck feed. According to statistics, the sales volume of the six grain retail stores on the entire street has decreased month by month since March, with May decreasing by more than 58,000 catties compared to March.

    天津市东楼街居民订立节约粮食公约
    天津市六区东楼街居民受到节约粮食的教育，百分之八十的住户订立了节约粮食公约。据六区人民委员会检查，东楼街已成为节约粮食较好的街道。
    东楼街的各居民委员会和党的宣传员曾采取开座谈会、读报和家庭访问等方法，向居民宣传节约粮食的意义。全街一万四千多人中，有七千五百多人直接听到了报告和宣传，每户的家庭主妇都参加了座谈会。
    居民们都认真执行了节约粮食公约。许多人家精打细算地按实制定了购粮计划，每月吃多少买多少。妇女们注意减少剩饭浪费，过去各个胡同、里巷的脏水池上常倒有面条、米饭、窝头等食物，现在已看不到了。喂养鸡鸭的住户都采用米糠、豆腐渣等代替粮食作鸡鸭饲料。据统计，全街六个粮食零售店的销售量自三月份以来逐月下降，五月份比三月份减少五万八千多斤。　（新华社）
