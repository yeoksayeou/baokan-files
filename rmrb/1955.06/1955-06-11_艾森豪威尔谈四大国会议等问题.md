Xinhua News Agency, June 9th, TASS Washington, June 9th: U.S. President Eisenhower said at a press conference on the 8th that if the maximum duration of the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference could be stipulated in advance, he would be willing to extend the conference to six days. He believes that one should not have excessive expectations for the first meeting, but one can hope that this meeting will foster a new atmosphere that will allow the work to be fruitful.

He said that there is a confidence in the world that high-level talks will open up new avenues for reaching agreements.

At the beginning of the press conference, Eisenhower spontaneously made an informal statement on the Soviet government's invitation to Adenauer to go to Moscow to discuss issues related to both parties. He said that the United States believes that Adenauer will be loyal to his allies and friends.

In response to a question as to whether the United States intended to meet with Adenauer before the Four Foreign Ministers met in San Francisco, Eisenhower said that Adenauer would have lunch with him on June 14 for discussions.

Someone asked whether the United States opposes the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany, and whether it is concerned about this matter. Eisenhower replied that this issue only arose yesterday after he had talks with Dulles. He then said that his personal answer to this question would be negative.

    艾森豪威尔谈四大国会议等问题
    新华社九日讯　塔斯社华盛顿九日讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔八日在记者招待会上说，如果预先可以规定四大国政府首脑会议最长的延续期限的话，他愿意将会议期限延长到六天。他认为，不应当对第一次会议抱过大的希望，但是可以希望这次会议能够促成一种新的气氛，使工作能够获得成效。
    他说，世界上有着一种信心，认为高级会谈将打开达成协议的新道路。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会开始时，自动就苏联政府邀请阿登纳去莫斯科讨论同双方有关的问题一事发表非正式的谈话。他说，美国相信，阿登纳将忠于他的盟国和朋友。
    艾森豪威尔在回答他是否打算在四国外长在旧金山聚会之前同阿登纳会谈一次的问题时说：阿登纳将在六月十四日同他共进午餐举行会谈。
    有人问美国是否反对苏联和西德关系正常化，是否对此事感到忧虑。艾森豪威尔回答说，在昨天，他同杜勒斯会谈后，才产生了这一问题。他接着说，他个人对这个问题愿作否定的回答。
