    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 13th: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 3rd, protesting the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's illegal arrest of Japanese Communist Party leading cadre Tsunezaburo Takenaka on the 2nd, and demanding his immediate release.
    The statement pointed out: The Metropolitan Police Department's arrest and detention of Tsunezaburo Takenaka was based on the so-called "Group Regulation Ordinance," which even the courts have deemed to have lost its basis. This is an illegal trampling of human rights, an infringement on the rights and freedoms of the people, and a step forward on the road to an atomic war that deprives Japan of independence and peace.
    The statement demanded the immediate revocation of the illegal arrest warrant issued to the leaders of the Japanese Communist Party based on the "Group Regulation Ordinance"; and the cessation of all illegal suppression, arrests, and detentions carried out throughout the country.
    The statement also demanded the abolition of all occupation laws and suppression regulations to guarantee the rights and freedoms of the people.

    日本共产党中央指导部发表声明
    抗议东京警视厅非法逮捕竹中恒三郎
    新华社十三日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央指导部三日发表声明，抗议东京警视厅二日非法逮捕日本共产党领导干部竹中恒三郎，并且要求立即释放他。
    声明指出：警视厅对竹中恒三郎的逮捕和拘留，是根据连法院都认为已经失去根据的所谓“团体等规正令”而进行的。这是对人权的非法蹂躏，是对人民的权利和自由的侵害，是向剥夺日本独立、和平的原子战争的道路前进的一步。
    声明要求立即撤销根据“团体等规正令”而对日本共产党领导者发出的非法的逮捕命令；停止在全国各地进行的一切非法镇压、逮捕和拘留。
    声明并要求撤销一切占领法规和镇压法规，保障人民的权利和自由。
