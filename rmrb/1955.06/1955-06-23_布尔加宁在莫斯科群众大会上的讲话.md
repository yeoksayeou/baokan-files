Bulganin's Speech at the Moscow Mass Rally

Comrades!

Respected Prime Minister! Friends!

On behalf of the Soviet government, on behalf of the representatives of the working people of Moscow present here and the entire Soviet people, and in my own name, I express my gratitude to our distinguished guest, the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Mr. Nehru, for the warm and friendly words he has spoken about our motherland. We, the Soviet people, are very pleased to hear Mr. Nehru's speech. We know that Mr. Nehru is an outstanding leader of the Indian people's struggle for national independence and a heroic fighter for peace (stormy applause).

The Soviet people welcome Mr. Nehru, the representative and envoy of the great Indian people, with special warmth, excitement, and sincere friendly feelings in their own land.

Friendly relations have long existed between our country and India. The diligence and wisdom of the multinational four hundred million Indian people, who have created immortal cultural treasures in the course of many centuries of history, their tireless struggle for freedom and national independence, and their unwavering will for peace have won the deep respect and warm sympathy of all nationalities in our country (applause).

The Soviet people follow with great interest and friendly feelings the efforts of the great Indian people to establish a socialist-type society in their own country, and congratulate the Indian people on their achievements in developing the economy and national industry.

The relations between the Soviet Union and India are based on a solid and reliable foundation. The principles on which these relations are based are: mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

These five principles of peaceful diplomacy were jointly announced by India and the People's Republic of China. Later, Burma and Yugoslavia also endorsed these five principles. Then, as Mr. Nehru has already said here, twenty-nine countries in Asia and Africa at the Bandung Conference endorsed these five principles and included them in the declaration on consolidating international peace and cooperation adopted by the Bandung Conference. The Soviet government also agrees with these five principles and believes that they can serve as a common program for the people of all countries in the cause of maintaining and consolidating peace (applause).

The relationship between the Soviet Union and India is a convincing proof that confirms the correctness of the great Lenin's principle that countries with different socio-political systems can coexist and cooperate peacefully.

The firm desire to strive for peace and friendship with the people of all countries, and the struggle to eliminate international tensions, bring the Soviet Union and India particularly close. The people of our two countries, engaged in peaceful creative labor, do not want war. They are moving towards a new and better life through their respective paths.

Ensuring peace and the security of all nations has always been the main goal and highest principle of Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet government has recently taken many new measures to ease international tensions and eliminate doubts in international relations. These measures are: the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty, the Soviet government's proposals on the issue of reducing armaments, banning atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of a new war, the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the proposal on establishing diplomatic and trade relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and other measures.

The Soviet government has agreed to participate in the four-power summit to be held in Geneva on July 18. Our starting point for this decision is that the purpose of the meeting will be to ease international tensions and consolidate trust in international relations. We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal, and we hope that the other participating countries in this meeting will also work hard to do so (stormy and prolonged applause).

The Soviet Union's contribution to the cause of consolidating peace is supported by peace-loving people of all countries, including the Indian people.

The Soviet people also highly value India's recent significant contribution to the cause of peace.

With the active participation of India, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, the armistice agreement in Korea was signed, ending the military operations in Indochina.

India was one of the initiators of the Bandung Asian-African Conference, which made an important contribution to the struggle of the Asian and African people for their rights and independence, and to the cause of consolidating universal peace.

Both India and the Soviet Union advocate reducing armaments and troops, and banning atomic and hydrogen weapons. We hope that when the Soviet government's broad and fundamental program for reducing armaments and banning atomic and hydrogen weapons is realized, Mr. Nehru and the Indian government will be our allies and friends (stormy applause).

India and the Soviet Union are working together to resolve the Taiwan issue satisfactorily in accordance with the national interests of the Chinese people.

The joint struggle waged by India and the Soviet Union for the People's Republic of China to gain its legitimate seat in the United Nations is particularly appreciated by all peace-loving people (stormy and prolonged applause).

India and the Soviet Union are actively engaged in the struggle to eliminate international tensions, strive for peace and international cooperation, and consistently uphold the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter.

The tenth anniversary of the United Nations opened yesterday in San Francisco. People around the world are looking forward with hope, expecting that this anniversary will be the beginning of new measures to ensure peace and international security.

Today, on behalf of the Soviet Union, I extend my congratulations to the tenth anniversary of the United Nations, and on behalf of the Soviet people and the Soviet government, I warmly hope that this world people's organization will continue to unswervingly devote itself to the realization of the ideals of the United Nations Charter for the benefit of universal peace and security. Our country and government will do everything possible to promote the realization of this noble goal (stormy applause).

Cooperation between the Soviet Union and India is not limited to international relations.

When talking about the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and India, one cannot fail to mention the constantly expanding mutually beneficial economic and cultural ties between the two countries, which promote further closeness between our two peoples.

There is no doubt that Mr. Nehru's visit to the Soviet Union, his close contact with the Soviet people, and the personal contact he has had with the Soviet leadership will help further develop and consolidate the friendship and cooperation between our two countries. I am pleased to point out that the exchange of views we have had indicates that we have mutual understanding and consensus on many issues that are of utmost importance to easing international tensions (stormy and prolonged applause).

During his visit to the Soviet Union, Mr. Nehru has had the opportunity to see for himself that the Soviet people are sincerely committed to defending and consolidating peace. There is no doubt that Mr. Nehru has also had the opportunity to see for himself that our people have deep and sincere sympathy and friendship for the Indian people (stormy applause).

On behalf of the Soviet people and the Soviet government, I express our respect to you, Prime Minister, to the Indian government, and to all the people of India, and wish you success on the road to the development and prosperity of India (stormy and prolonged applause. Shouts of "Hurrah!").

Long live the friendship and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and India!

For the happiness of the people of both countries, for universal peace and security, may the friendship between the Soviet Union and India grow and be consolidated! (All stand up, stormy and prolonged applause. Shouts of "Hurrah!")

    布尔加宁在莫斯科群众大会上的讲话
    同志们！
    敬爱的总理！朋友们！
    我代表苏联政府、代表到会的莫斯科劳动人民的代表和全体苏联人民、并以我个人的名义对我们的贵宾、印度共和国总理尼赫鲁先生表示感谢，感谢他对我们的祖国所说的热情的和友好的话。我们，苏联人民，很高兴听到尼赫鲁先生的讲话，我们知道尼赫鲁先生是印度人民争取民族独立的斗争的一位杰出的领导者和争取和平的英勇战士（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    苏联人民怀着特别的热情、兴奋和诚挚友好的感情在自己的国土上欢迎尼赫鲁先生，欢迎这位伟大印度人民的代表和使者。
    我国和印度之间久已存在着友好的关系。在许多世纪的历史中创造了不朽文化宝藏的多民族的四亿印度人民的勤劳和智慧、他们争取自由和民族独立的不倦奋斗和他们始终不渝的爱好和平的意志，博得了我国各族人民的深切敬爱和热烈的同情（掌声）。
    苏联人民以极大的兴趣和友好的感情关怀着伟大的印度人民为在自己国内建立社会主义类型的社会所作的努力，并祝贺印度人民在发展经济和民族工业方面所获得的成就。
    苏联和印度的关系是建立在巩固的和可靠的基础上的。建立这种关系的原则是：互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处。
    这五项和平的外交政策的原则是印度和中华人民共和国共同宣布的。后来缅甸和南斯拉夫也赞成这五项原则，再后，正如尼赫鲁先生在此地已经说过的，在万隆会议上亚非两洲二十九个国家都赞同这五项原则，并将它们列入万隆会议所通过的关于巩固国际和平和合作的宣言中。苏联政府也赞同这五项原则，并认为这五项原则可以作为各国人民在维护和巩固和平的事业中的共同纲领（鼓掌）。
    苏联和印度的关系是一个令人信服的明证，它证实了伟大的列宁所提出的关于社会政治制度不同的国家可以和平共处和合作的原理的正确性。
    争取和平和同各国人民友好的坚定愿望以及为消除国际紧张局势而进行的斗争，使得苏联和印度特别接近起来了。从事和平创造性劳动的我们两国人民都不希望战争。他们通过各自的道路，走向新的、美好的生活。
    保障和平和各国人民安全，一直是苏联外交政策的主要目标和最高原则。苏联政府最近采取了许多新的措施，以缓和国际紧张局势和消除国际关系中的疑虑。这些措施就是：奥地利国家条约的缔结，苏联政府关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新的战争威胁的问题的建议，苏联同南斯拉夫的关系的正常化，关于苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立外交和贸易关系的建议，苏联和日本的谈判以及其他措施。
    苏联政府已经同意参加七月十八日要在日内瓦举行的四国政府首脑会议。我们这样决定的出发点是：会议的目的将是缓和国际紧张局势和巩固国际关系中的信任。我们将竭尽一切力量达到这个目的，并且希望这个会议的其他参与国也努力这样做（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）。
    苏联对巩固和平事业所作的贡献受到各国爱好和平的人民、包括印度人民的同情和支持。
    苏联人民对于印度近来为和平事业所作的重大贡献也给予很高的评价。
    在印度、苏联和中华人民共和国的积极参加下，签订了朝鲜的停战协定，结束了印度支那的军事行动。
    印度是召开万隆亚非会议的发起国之一，这次会议对于亚非各国人民争取自身的权利和独立的斗争、对于巩固普遍和平的事业是一个重要的贡献。
    印度和苏联都主张裁减军备和军队，主张禁止原子武器和氢武器。我们希望，在实现苏联政府所提出的关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器和氢武器的广泛的和根本的纲领的时候，尼赫鲁先生和印度政府将做我们的同盟者和朋友（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    印度和苏联正在共同努力，争取按照中国人民的民族利益圆满地解决台湾问题。
    印度和苏联两国为中华人民共和国争取联合国中的合法席位而进行的共同斗争是全体爱好和平的人民所特别感激的（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）。
    苏联和印度两国为消除国际紧张局势、争取和平和国际合作而积极地进行斗争，同时始终不渝地奉行联合国宪章中所提出的原则。
    联合国十周年纪念会昨天在旧金山开幕。世界各地的人们都满怀希望地期待着，这次纪念会将是保障和平和国际安全的新措施的开端。
    今天，我代表苏联向联合国十周年纪念会祝贺，并代表苏联人民和苏联政府热烈地希望这个世界人民的机构继续为普遍和平和安全的利益坚定不移地致力实现联合国宪章的理想。我们国家和政府将竭尽全力，促进这个崇高目标的实现（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    苏联和印度之间的合作不限于国际关系方面。
    在谈到苏联和印度之间的友谊和合作时，不能不谈到两国之间的互利的、促使我们两国人民进一步接近的经济和文化联系的不断扩大。
    毫无疑问，尼赫鲁先生的访问苏联、他同苏联人民的亲近的交往以及同苏联领导人员所进行的个人接触，将有助于进一步发展和巩固我们两国之间的友谊和合作。我很高兴地指出，我们所进行的意见交换表明，我们之间在许多对缓和国际紧张局势具有极其重要意义的问题上，是相互谅解的，意见是一致的（暴风雨般的长时间的掌声）。
    尼赫鲁先生在访问苏联期间，有机会亲自看到，苏联人民是真诚地致力于保卫和巩固和平的。毫无疑问，尼赫鲁先生也有机会亲自看到了，我国人民对印度人民是怀着深切的、真挚的同情和友谊的（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    我代表苏联人民和苏联政府，向您，总理先生，向印度政府和印度全体人民，表示我们的敬意，并祝你们在发展和繁荣印度的道路上取得成就（暴风雨般的长时间的掌声。高呼：“乌拉！”）。
    苏联和印度两国人民的友谊和合作万岁！
    为了两国人民的幸福，为了普遍和平和安全，祝苏印两国的友谊日益发展和巩固！（全体起立，暴风雨般的长时间的掌声。高呼：“乌拉！”）
