Northern Jiangsu Vegetable Oil Factory Improves Oil Yield

The residual oil rate in peanut cake and rapeseed cake at the Jiangsu Provincial State-Owned Northern Jiangsu Vegetable Oil Factory has significantly decreased. The residual oil rate in peanut cake has dropped from an average of 5.15% at the beginning of production in February this year to an average of about 3.5% currently. The residual oil rate in rapeseed cake has decreased from an average of 7.58% in 1954 to an average of 6.2% in the first quarter of this year, with a minimum reaching 5.25%.

The Northern Jiangsu Vegetable Oil Factory is an oil pressing factory using continuous screw presses. Since April 1954, it has attached importance to promoting advanced experience and improving oil yield. Based on the oil pressing raw materials in different periods, they have successively promoted the oil pressing experience of Li Chuanjiang from the Liaoning Local State-Owned Siping Oil and Wine Factory and other advanced experiences. At the same time, they strengthened technical leadership, emphasized the combination of workers and technicians, and also made necessary improvements in equipment. After nearly a year of repeated experiments and exploration, since January this year, they have initially obtained a relatively complete set of operating methods for rapeseed and peanut oil pressing, greatly improving the oil yield.

    苏北植物油厂提高出油率
    江苏省地方国营苏北植物油厂的花生仁干饼残油率和菜籽干饼残油率显著降低。花生仁的干饼残油率从今年二月开始生产时的平均百分之五点一五降低到目前的平均百分之三点五左右；菜籽的干饼残油率从一九五四年的平均百分之七点五八，下降到今年第一季度的平均百分之六点二，最低达到百分之五点二五。
    苏北植物油厂是一个动力螺旋机连续生产的榨油工厂，从一九五四年四月以来一直重视推广先进经验、提高出油率的工作。他们根据不同时期的榨油原料，先后推广了辽宁地方国营四平油酒制造厂李川江的榨油经验和其他先进经验。他们同时加强了技术领导，重视工人和技术人员的结合，在设备方面也作了必要的改进。这样经过将近一年时间的反复试验和摸索，从今年一月份以后，初步得出了菜籽和花生仁榨油的一套比较完整的操作方法，大大提高了出油率。　　　（本报驻南京记者）
