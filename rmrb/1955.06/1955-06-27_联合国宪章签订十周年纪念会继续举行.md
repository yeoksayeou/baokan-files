Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, June 26th: The tenth anniversary commemorative meeting of the signing of the United Nations Charter continued on the 24th.

    Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Pearson, in his speech, spoke about the role of the United Nations, saying that the current atmosphere of anxiety and distrust can only be eliminated through "active and friendly cooperation."

    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles spared no effort to boast about the policies the United States has implemented in recent years, but he did not talk about anything new. It is pointed out here that Dulles' speech did not answer the questions raised by the head of the Soviet delegation, Molotov, in his speech on the 22nd.

    Czechoslovakian Minister of Foreign Affairs David pointed out in his speech that the U.S. representative repeated the old tune of slander against the people's democratic countries in his speech. This kind of attack serves the cold war purposes that contradict the tasks and purposes of the United Nations. The various nationalities of Czechoslovakia have never enjoyed freedom and independence as fully as they do now, and they will not allow anyone to interfere in their internal affairs.

    He said that Czechoslovakia has always been committed to consolidating the United Nations. It believes that the abnormal situation of the United Nations, especially the Security Council, without the participation of one of the five major powers, the People's Republic of China, is intolerable.

    Indonesian representative Soegarjo spoke about the national liberation movement of colonies and dependent countries. He said that more than 200 million people in colonies and dependent countries are still deprived of national freedom and independence. He said that the struggle of these countries for independence, social justice, and progress is a matter of concern to the people of Asia and Africa. He called for a realistic assessment of the new Asia and pointed out that allowing the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations should be the first result of the new assessment. Soegarjo called on all countries to restore the spirit of peaceful cooperation, mutual understanding, and consultation to promote peace between countries.

    Ukrainian Republic Minister of Foreign Affairs Palamarchuk pointed out in his speech that there are sufficient objective conditions and possibilities for easing international tensions and consolidating peace, and the member states of the United Nations must strive to utilize these possibilities. He asked the representatives to pay attention to the significance of the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union.

    Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs Fawzi, in his speech, welcomed the "recent efforts" made by the great powers in resolving existing international differences through negotiations. He called on the member states of the United Nations to cooperate more actively and resolve contentious issues through negotiations in order to "promote the establishment of an atmosphere of mutual trust." He said that the United Nations should concentrate its efforts on solving issues such as disarmament.

    Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammed Naim said in his speech that establishing trust between countries could pave the way for easing international tensions and reducing armaments.

    Indian representative Menon expressed hope for the success of the summit meeting of the heads of government of the four major powers.

    The speeches of the heads of delegations of the member states of the United Nations have come to an end.

    Former U.S. President Truman, who was invited to attend the meeting, spoke at the meeting. He expressed his support for the proposal to hold further negotiations and meetings among the great powers.
