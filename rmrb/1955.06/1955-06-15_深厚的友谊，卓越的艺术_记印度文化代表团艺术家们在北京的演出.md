    Profound Friendship, Excellent Art
    ——On the Performances of the Indian Cultural Delegation Artists in Beijing
    Ma Ke, Executive Director of the Chinese Musicians Association
    We greeted the guests from afar with flowers, and we thanked them for their excellent performances with excited applause. We believe that the visiting performances of the friends of the Indian Cultural Delegation in various parts of China will be met with the same warm and sincere welcome. This feeling is not difficult to understand. Because, through their activities, the Indian artists have brought profound friendship and the desire for peaceful coexistence, which are the most precious feelings of our time. At the same time, their arrival cannot but remind people of the long history of cultural exchange and friendly relations between the two countries. Today we wait at the airport for the cultural envoys who have flown in from afar, but these envoys have been travelling back and forth since people only used primitive means of transportation. They conquered thousands of mountains and rivers, connected the thoughts and cultures of these two ancient countries, and produced huge mutual influences. Taking music as an example, as early as the Han Dynasty, "Brahma chant" was introduced to China; and due to the research on Sanskrit in the translation of Buddhist scriptures, it promoted the progress of Chinese phonology and influenced the development of Chinese rhyme and singing literature. In the Sui Dynasty, the government officially listed "Indian Music" as one of the Seven Departments of Music and introduced it widely in the country. During the Tang Dynasty, cultural exchanges between the two countries became even closer. Not only were more Indian melodies and musical instruments introduced, but they also played a positive role in the development of Chinese musical literature. For example, Chinese folk musicians and poets drew on the "bianwen" that was used to propagate Buddhist scriptures at that time and created "Zhu Gong Diao," "Bao Juan," and later "Tanci" and "Guci" storytelling music and literature, some of which still play an important role in people's daily musical life.
    In modern history, China and India were both countries oppressed by imperialism, but the heroic people of both countries have been fighting against the colonialists to defend their nation's ancient and excellent culture. In the past, the rule of imperialism and reactionaries hindered cultural exchanges between the people of the two countries, but now this situation has fundamentally changed. Since the founding of New China, we have sent cultural delegations to India more than once, and we have also welcomed Indian cultural delegations to visit and perform in China more than once. However, this cultural delegation led by Mr. Chand is the largest one. Therefore, we have the opportunity to see their richer performances, thereby further enhancing our understanding of the Indian people and Indian art.
    The "Indo-China Friendship Song" led by Mr. D. V. Paluskar first left us with a deep impression. This is sung in the traditional Indian way: seven or eight people, sitting on the ground, some holding musical instruments, singing in unison to the accompaniment of "tabla" (drums). The voice of the lead singer is deep and sincere and natural in expression. The melody of this song is beautiful and harmonious, and the dragging tones of the chorus part are vigorously unfolded and endless, which is very expressive. From the warm applause of the audience, we can hear the political and artistic success of this song.
    "Punjab Song" is sung in the folk style of Punjab. There are five singers, all dressed in festive costumes and holding musical instruments. The two actors (Mr. Deepak and Mr. Manohar) who play percussion instruments lead the singing—
    "Our country is happy,
    Here are five roaring rivers;
    Here are beautiful women with hair like dark clouds;
    There are also burly, brave, and handsome men,
    They are happy to take risks and are always ready to sacrifice everything for the motherland."
    They sang and danced, the singing was pastoral, loud, and high-pitched, and at the same time it was as cheerful and leaping as a dance music. This form is very similar to the folk Yangko performances in northern China. That kind of cordial style and open and joyful mood have a strong appeal to the audience, making us also want to jump up and sing with them.
    Mr. Debabrata Biswas' solo "Tagore's Ode" and Mr. D. V. Paluskar's solo "Prayer Song," although we cannot fully understand the content of what is being sung due to language barriers, we can feel from the music that on the one hand, Indian classical songs have strict metrical patterns and complex techniques, and on the other hand, these singing masters can master these metrical patterns and techniques and fully express their emotions. Their songs express emotions such as piety, loyalty, and peace, and express the Indian people's love for life and their yearning for a lofty ideal.
    Indian classical songs and folk songs have rich melodies and moving rhythms. This shows that this is the crystallization of thousands of years of ancient culture. The songs we have heard are far from representing the entirety of Indian songs, but this has already made us feel that there is no limit to beauty. We believe that Indian artists will absorb and refine more and richer things from their own national and folk traditional music.
    Indian musical instruments also have strong national characteristics. Just talking about drums, they are divided into mridangam, pakhavaj, khol, bhangra, pungi, and tabla, each of which has different structures and playing methods. Drumming is a specialized and complex technique, and there are more than 160 kinds of rhythmic forms. The beats are also very complex. In addition to the usual four and six beats, there are also five, ten, seven, and fourteen beats, etc. Each beat has different accents and pitches and timbres (caused by the position of the fingers touching the drum surface or by controlling the tightness of the drum skin with the other palm). Like many Chinese folk bands, drums play a leading role in the music (mastering the rhythm), and the drummer is also a key figure in the band. In every program, whether it is vocal music, instrumental music, or dance, it is inseparable from drums, and indeed it has undertaken its due tasks. In programs such as "Bharatanatyam" and "Kathak Dance," we can feel how the sound of drums matches the rhythm of the dance and combines interestingly with the bells on the dancer's feet. In programs such as "Handkerchief Dance," we heard the sound of drums expressing the whirlwind-like enthusiasm and激荡 emotions, which made people very excited. In a dance drama like "The Gift," the drums sometimes knock out lyrical syllables and sometimes emit violent and dramatic sounds. In a program like "Drum Dance," Mr. Singajit Singh and Mr. Nadiya Singh coordinated with their vigorous and unrestrained dances, knocking out magnificent sounds on the drums like thousands of horses galloping. This program is reminiscent of Chinese waist drums. In many programs, the performances of drummers such as Munne Khan and Prem Vallabh who play accompaniment have truly reached the point of superb skill. Their hands dance on the drum surface, making your eyes unable to keep up.
    The performances of other Indian musical instruments such as sarod and sarangi also showed a high degree of skill and the characteristics of Indian folk musical instruments. The precise techniques, subtle sound control, and sensitive sense of rhythm of the performers all show that their skills have reached a state of perfection. The characteristics of Indian musical instruments are that they are soft and pleasant, and the continuation of their fixed bass (tanpura) also inspires us to imagine the Indian countryside.
    The performance of "Water Cups" also aroused great interest in us. It is said that this instrument was spread from China to India, which is entirely possible. China originally had pottery musical instruments such as "fou," and music played with utensils such as cups and plates was also popular among the people, but it seems that there are not many cases where it has developed to knocking out melodies. The sound of "Water Cups" is tinkling and pleasant, and the performer, Mr. Gajanan Karandikar, uses the two sticks very measuredly.
    We are satisfied with the entire performance. These beautiful programs gave us great artistic feelings and also conveyed the deep friendship of the Indian people. If Chinese musicians learned a lot from Indian musicians in the long past, then we can certainly learn a lot in the same way now. We especially respect the practical spirit of Indian musicians in exploring and developing their own national music.
    I wish the friends of the Indian Cultural Delegation good health! I wish them success in their performances all over China! (Attached pictures)

    深厚的友谊，卓越的艺术
    ——记印度文化代表团艺术家们在北京的演出
    中国音乐家协会常务理事　马可
    我们用鲜花迎接了远方来的嘉宾，我们用激动的掌声答谢他们卓越的演出。我们相信，印度文化代表团的朋友们在中国各地的访问演出，将会受到同样热烈而真诚的欢迎。这种心情是不难理解的。因为，印度艺术家们通过他们的活动带来了深厚的友谊和和平共处的愿望，而这是我们这一时代最可珍贵的感情。同时，他们的到来又不能不使人回想起两国之间文化交流和友好相处的悠久历史。今天我们在机场上等候天外飞来的文化使者，但远在人们只会使用原始的交通工具时就已经有了这种使者的往还。他们征服了千山万水，沟通了这两个世界古国之间的思想文化，使相互产生了巨大的影响。以音乐为例，远在汉朝，“梵呗”就被介绍到中国来；并且由于在翻译佛经中对梵文的研究，推动了中国音韵科学的进步，影响了中国韵文和歌唱文学的发展。隋朝时政府正式把“天竺乐”列为七部乐之一，在国内得到广泛的介绍。唐朝时两国文化交流更加密切，不仅有更多的印度乐曲和乐器被介绍进来，同时对中国音乐文学的发展也起了积极的作用。例如中国的民间音乐家和诗人借鉴当时宣传佛经的“变文”而创造了“诸宫调”、“宝卷”及其后的“弹词”、“鼓词”等说唱音乐和文学，其中有的至今还在人民日常音乐生活中占着重要的地位。
    在近代历史上中国和印度同是受帝国主义压迫的国家，但两国英勇的人民一直在向殖民者进行斗争，保卫着自己民族古老的优秀文化。过去由于帝国主义和反动派的统治阻碍了两国人民间的文化交流，现在这种情况根本改变了。新中国成立以来我们不止一次地有文化代表团到印度去，也不止一次地迎接印度的文化代表团来中国访问演出。但这次由钱达先生率领的文化代表团却是规模最大的一次。因此我们能够有机会看到他们更加丰富的演出，从而更加增进我们对于印度人民和印度艺术的了解。
    由德·维·帕卢斯卡尔先生领唱的“印中友好歌”首先给我们留下了深刻的印象。这是按照印度传统的方式来歌唱的：七八个人，席地而坐，有的手执乐器，在“塔布拉”（鼓）的伴奏下一唱众和。领唱者的声音是浑厚的，表情非常诚挚和自然。这首歌曲的曲调优美而和谐，和唱部分的拖腔蓬勃展开，滔滔不绝，很富有表现力。从听众热烈的掌声里，我们可以听到这首歌曲在政治上和艺术上的成功。
    “旁遮普之歌”则是按照旁遮普地方的民间方 式歌唱的。参加演唱的共有五人，都穿着节日的盛装，手拿乐器，由两个使打击乐器的演员（迪帕克先生和马诺哈尔先生）主唱——
    “我们的国土是欢乐的，
    这里有五条滚滚的大河；
    这里有美丽的妇女，头发像乌云；
    还有魁梧、勇敢、英俊的男子，
    他们乐于冒险，随时准备着为祖国牺牲一切。”
    他们边唱边舞，歌声有着牧歌式的嘹亮、高吭，同时又有舞曲一样的欢快、跳荡。这种形式很像我国北方民间的秧歌小场子。那种亲切的风格和开朗、欢乐的情绪对观众有强烈的感染力，使我们也想随着他们一起跳起来唱起来。
    德巴布拉塔·毕斯瓦斯先生独唱的“泰戈尔的颂歌”和德·维·帕卢斯卡尔先生独唱的“祈祷之歌”，虽然由于语言的隔阂，我们不能完全理解所唱的内容，但我们从音乐上却可感受到一方面印度古典歌曲有着严整的格律和复杂的技巧，另一方面这些歌唱大师们又能掌握这些格律和技巧而充分发挥他们的感情。他们的歌声表现了虔诚、忠实、平和等情绪，表现了印度人民对生活的热爱和对于一种崇高理想的向往。
    印度的古典歌曲和民间歌曲有丰富的曲调性和动人的节奏。这令人看出这是几千年古老文化的结晶。我们所听到的歌曲远不能代表印度歌曲的全部，但这已使我们觉得美不胜收。我们相信印度的艺术家将会从自己民族和民间的传统音乐中吸收和提炼更多更丰富的东西。
    印度的乐器也是具有强烈的民族特色的。单就鼓一项来谈，就分成姆瑞当、帕卡瓦吉、克候乐、布候乐、朋和塔尔拉几种，每种的构造和打法都有所不同。鼓的敲击是一种专门的复杂技巧，节奏形式有一百六十多种。节拍也很复杂，除通常的四拍、六拍外还有五拍、十拍、七拍、十四拍等，每种节拍在击法上又有轻重音和音高、音色（由于手指击触鼓面的位置或由另一手掌控制鼓皮的松紧造成）的不同。正像中国的许多民间乐队一样，鼓在乐曲中起着主导的作用（掌握节奏），鼓师也是乐队中主要的人物。在每一个节目中，不论是声乐、器乐或舞蹈都离不开鼓，而的确它也担负起了应尽的任务。我们在“婆罗多舞”和“卡塔克舞”等节目中能够感到鼓声如何配合舞蹈的节奏，并且和舞蹈者脚上的铃声有趣地结合起来。我们在“手帕舞”等节目中听到鼓声表现那旋风般的热烈、激荡的情绪，使人非常兴奋。在“赏赐”这样的舞剧中，鼓有时敲出抒情的音节，有时又发出狂暴的、戏剧性非常强烈的声音。在“鼓舞”这样的节目中，辛加吉特·辛格先生和纳迪亚·辛格两位先生配合着他们刚健泼剌的舞蹈，在鼓上敲出有如万马奔腾般的豪壮声音。这个节目令人联想起中国的腰鼓。在许多节目中担任伴奏的鼓师蒙内·康恩和普雷姆·瓦拉布等先生们的演奏真正达到神乎其技的地步，他们的手在鼓面上飞舞，使你的眼睛都跟不上来。
    其他印度乐器如瑟路达，萨朗基的演奏也表现出了高度的技巧和印度民间乐器的特色。演奏者精确的手法，细微的声音控制和灵敏的节奏感，都说明了他们的技艺达到炉火纯青的地步。印度乐器的特点是柔和悦耳，其固定低音（坦普拉）的延续也启发我们去想像印度的乡土风光。
    “水杯”的演奏也引起我们很大的兴趣。这种乐器据说是从中国流传到印度去的，这是完全可能的。中国古代本有“缶”之类的陶制乐器，在民间也流行着用杯、盘等用具敲打的音乐，但发展到敲击旋律似乎还不多见。“水杯”的声音丁冬悦耳，演奏者加贾南·卡朗迪卡尔先生把两个棒子运用得很有分寸。
    我们对于整个的演出是满意的。这些优美的节目给了我们很大的艺术感受，同时也传达出了印度人民的深情厚谊。如果说过去长远的年代里中国的音乐家曾向印度的音乐家学习了很多东西的话，那末我们现在一定可以同样地学习到很多东西。我们尤其尊敬印度的音乐家们对自己民族音乐发掘和发展的实际精神。
    祝印度文化代表团的朋友们身体健康！祝他们在中国各地演出的成功！（附图片）
