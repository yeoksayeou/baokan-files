Zhejiang Unemployed Workers Participate in Land Reclamation in Batches

Zhejiang Province is mobilizing unemployed urban workers to reclaim barren mountains and wastelands in mountainous areas such as Jinhua and Jiande. The first batch of 440 young unemployed people from towns and cities such as Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Hangxian enthusiastically responded to the government's call and went to the mountainous areas of Tangdian and Shimen townships in Jinhua County in early June to reclaim land. Before their departure, the local governments held farewell rallies. Representatives of the young people who went to reclaim wasteland stated that it was a glorious task to reclaim land and increase production for socialist construction. The second and third batches of 1,200 unemployed people are also concentrating on studying and will go to reclaim wasteland in batches within the 20th of this month.

The southern mountainous area of Zhejiang Province has a large amount of fertile barren mountains and wastelands with gentle slopes, which can be planted with food crops, tea trees, oil-tea, medicinal materials and other crops. The Jiande area has 158,000 mu of reclaimable barren mountains and wastelands, most of which are red soil, which can be planted with miscellaneous grains and oil-tea after improvement. Shimen and Tangwan townships in Jinhua County, Jinhua Special District, have more than 100,000 mu of fertile barren mountains and wastelands with slight erosion, which can be planted twice a year or five times in two years. Among them, there are more than 3,000 mu of flat land that can be cultivated with tractors; deep mountain grasslands can also greatly develop forestry and animal husbandry.

    浙江失业工人分批参加垦荒
    浙江省正动员城市失业工人去金华、建德等山区开垦荒山荒地。杭州、绍兴、杭县等市镇第一批四百四十个青年失业人员热烈响应政府号召，已于六月上旬赴金华县汤店、石门两乡山区开垦。出发前，当地政府都分别举行了欢送大会。前往开垦荒地的青年代表表示：为社会主义建设去开荒增产，是光荣的任务。第二、第三两批一千二百个失业人员也正集中学习，在本月二十日内将分批前往荒地开垦。
    浙江省南部山区有大量土质肥沃、坡度不高的荒山荒地、可种植粮食、茶树、油茶、药材等作物。建德地区可开垦的荒山荒地有十五万八千亩，大都是红壤土，经改良后可种杂粮和油茶。金华专区金华县石门、汤湾两乡有土质肥沃、冲刷轻微、一年可种二熟或两年可种五熟的荒山荒地十万多亩，其中有三千多亩成片的平坦地可用拖拉机耕作；深山草原还可大量发展林业和畜牧业。
