    Commemorating Comrade Qu Qiubai, Learning from Comrade Qu Qiubai
    Mao Dun
    June 18th is a painful day in our memories.
    Comrade Qu Qiubai was martyred in Changting, Fujian, twenty years ago on this day.
    Before that, many contradictory messages circulated in Shanghai—some of which were deliberately fabricated by the enemy. For example, it was said that he read Buddhist scriptures in prison and even claimed to be a scholar who would no longer engage in politics; or that he was "depressed," composing old-style poems and carving seals every day. The enemy's purpose in fabricating and spreading these rumors was, of course, political: first, to slander Qu Qiubai; second, to undermine Comrade Qu Qiubai's influence and prestige among progressive intellectuals at the time; and also, to try to shake the fighting spirit of young intellectuals under the ideological leadership of the Chinese Communist Party at the time. The enemy was cunning, and some of the rumors it fabricated were somewhat believable, because Qu Qiubai had studied Buddhist texts before becoming a Marxist and a Communist Party member, and the talented and versatile Qu Qiubai was indeed capable of writing old-style poems and was good at seal carving.
    In contrast to these messages, some said that Comrade Qu Qiubai had already been killed, while others said that he had escaped the clutches of the enemy; these were probably the fantasies and wishes of well-intentioned people who cared about Comrade Qu Qiubai (hence the escape theory), or premonitions (hence the theory of his death).
    The enemy was able to correctly assess Comrade Qu Qiubai's role in the cause of the Chinese revolution, especially in the revolutionary literary and art movement. This is why it fabricated those rumors and continued to fabricate them even after Comrade Qu Qiubai was martyred!
    The fighting life of Martyr Qu Qiubai is our model. For intellectuals born at the beginning of this century who experienced most of their lives in the old society, "A Superfluous Man's Words" will be very enlightening. This may just be my personal feeling. But I did first get to know Comrade Qu Qiubai from "A Superfluous Man's Words," and it was on this basis that I developed my respect and admiration for him.
    More than thirty years ago, people in their fifties now were often awakened by the sound of the "October Revolution" and fantasized about what a paradise the great country spanning Europe and Asia would become after the revolution. To think "it should be" was so naive and immature; if someone expressed a different opinion, you would definitely argue with them until you were red in the face. However, "A Superfluous Man's Words" and "Heart History of the Red Capital" educated those who were too naive and too innocent with "sober realism" (this term is borrowed, please do not interpret this sentence according to the original meaning of the term). Doing so was beneficial; at least at the time. Because I have seen that some people who held such fantasies later found that the development of facts could not immediately conform to their fantasies, and they felt deceived (in fact, they were deceived by their own fantasies), so they turned from passionate to cold, and even took the opposite path. For such people, I think "A Superfluous Man's Words" and "Heart History of the Red Capital" can cure their illness. At least, I have had such an experience; and because of this, I planted the seeds of respect for this unknown author.
      "A Superfluous Man's Words" and "Heart History of the Red Capital" "very sincerely portray the author's own ideological development process of becoming a communist" (quoted from the preface to "Selected Works of Qu Qiubai"). From the fourth section of "A Superfluous Man's Words," we know that Comrade Qu Qiubai, "when receiving Europeanized secondary education,... involuntarily became 'a man of letters,' first studying poetry, classical prose, and lyrics, and then studying classics; everyone also advocated 'spirituality'." After secondary school, three years before the "May Fourth" Movement, "pessimistic philosophical thoughts increased with the degree of my three years of studying philosophy. However, this 'pessimism' was different from my previous 'isolationism.' Gradually, mental phenomena changed. Because of studying the national heritage, I became interested and had the ambition to reorganize the national heritage through the revival of modern literature; because of studying Buddhism and trying to solve the problems of life, I had the heartfelt desire to humanize Buddhism through Bodhisattva practice."
    He called his thoughts at this time "a 'dualistic view of life' in lonely life." And his "entering the Russian Language Training School while continuing his philosophical research without interruption, a hard life working more than eleven hours a day, was a manifestation of this view of life." "The May Fourth Movement suddenly broke out, and I was swept into the vortex. The lonely life was broken.... With an incredible 'passion,' I participated in the student movement."
    "The meaning of the patriotic movement at that time must not be interpreted literally.... The student movement suddenly changed and tended towards socialism..." "However, just like the youth thoughts of the 1840s in Russia, the influence was blurred, and looking at the morning mist through a screen window, socialist schools and socialist meanings were chaotic and not very clear.... With the accumulated habits of studying philosophy, I fundamentally doubted the 'thinking methods' of social thoughts at that time," so "I left China and entered the land of hunger, upholding the ascetic view of life, to satisfy my 'inner demands'."
    A youth from a bankrupt "scholar class" family, who once sought a way to settle down in the so-called "Oriental culture," in the "May Fourth" tide, his "thoughts first came into contact with social life," finally produced a strong "inner demand," and resolutely went to New Russia. This "inner demand" is the firm will and position to serve the people. This "inner demand" made him bid farewell to his past thoughts and completed the "ideological development process of becoming a communist."
    This is how I understand Comrade Qu Qiubai's "A Superfluous Man's Words" and "Heart History of the Red Capital." And I also believe that in this respect, Comrade Qu Qiubai's ideological development process is basically the same as that of Mr. Lu Xun; and later, the reason why they hit it off at first sight and formed a deep friendship, in addition to the fact that they were comrades-in-arms fighting side by side in a common cause, I think that their experiences in the ideological development process of taking similar paths was also a factor. They both understood each other very well. Qu Qiubai's understanding of Lu Xun was profound, as seen in his "Preface to 'Selected Essays of Lu Xun'." This excellent essay played a very important guiding role in the literary and art circles at that time.
    Around the year of the "May 30th" Movement, Qu Qiubai arrived in Shanghai and lived in Zhabei. It was at this time that I was able to often consult him. But at that time, he could not spare more of his energy and time to guide the literary and art movement. I still remember a small thing now. From this small thing, it can be seen that in such busy work, he was always willing to help friends, unwilling to refuse friends' trivial requests, and used a very humorous way. That was on the morning of Mr. Zheng Zhenduo's wedding (the wedding ceremony was held in the afternoon). The marriage certificate needed to be stamped with the seal of the officiant. Probably Zhenduo took this matter very seriously. He wrote a letter to Comrade Qu Qiubai the day before, asking him to carve this seal. But on the morning of the wedding day, he received a letter from Qu Qiubai, inside which was a note with congratulations, and attached was a handwritten "Seal Carving Price List," one of which said, in essence, that carving seals for friends would not be charged, and special early pickup was possible, with a deadline of two days after receipt. Zhenduo was really anxious when he received this letter, because the officiant (Zhenduo's mother) did not usually have a seal, but the officiant's seal was required that afternoon. Just then, I arrived at Zhenduo's house. At this time, he was "grabbing a yellow ox and calling it a horse," and wanted me to carve one. But there was no carving knife. I hadn't done this stuff for a long time, and I didn't have any tools either. Later, I found a very small screwdriver and planned to deal with it, but it still didn't work when I tried it. But just then, Qu Qiubai's younger brother came, saying that he had brought a small gift for Qu Qiubai. He took out the gift, opened it, and there were two seals. Qu Qiubai's younger brother said: Qu Qiubai started carving early in the morning and sent out the joking letter at the same time.
    I still remember this small thing, and I don't mind writing it here because I think this small thing can also show a characteristic of Comrade Qu Qiubai: in enthusiasm and seriousness, there is humor from time to time. Later, during the extremely serious white terror in Shanghai in 1932-1933, every time I saw him, his conversation was always so calm and full of humor. This is the natural expression of revolutionary optimism.
    The fierce struggle on the Chinese literary and art front centered on Shanghai in 1931-1933 was inseparable from Comrade Qu Qiubai's activities. Leaving aside other things, his spirit of selfless labor is a model we should always learn from. At that time, he was ill and the dangerous environment made it impossible for him to settle down, but he wrote so many essays and articles, and introduced and translated so many Marxist literary and art theories and literary works.
    In the so-called "literary freedom" debate, the so-called "literary freedom" was a reactionary and deceptive slogan put forward by the so-called "third kind of people" at the time to challenge the left-wing and progressive literary and art movement led by the Party. Regarding these people who called themselves the "third kind of people" (actually, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang's special detachment on the cultural front), Comrade Qu Qiubai published the famous essay: "The Freedom of Literature and the Unfreedom of Writers." This is a highly combative essay that uses Marxist literary and artistic theory to analyze and criticize the essence of the reactionary theories (the so-called "literary freedom") on the literary scene at the time, and expounds some fundamental issues in Marxist literary and artistic theory; This essay not only exposed the enemy's disguise and shattered the deceptive effect of the enemy's reactionary theories on the vast literary and art circles (it is worth noting that these reactionary theories at the time were also clothed in Marxist garb), but can also be said to be the most rigorous and persuasive Marxist literary and artistic theory article up to that time. It had a great effect on the ideological education of the literary and art circles at that time.
      The "third kind of people" were clothed in Marxist garb—of course, they were disguised very clumsily. And they called themselves the "third kind of people" to show that they were neither left-wing nor right-wing; they did this, of course, because the specific environment at the time required them to appear in the posture of "middlemen" in order to play a deceptive role. Compared with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, the "third kind of people" are really like a small witch seeing a big witch. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique not only disguised itself more cleverly, but was also especially insidious and terrifying because it wore the hat of the left wing and even infiltrated the Party. However, just as the "third kind of people" were crushed back then, the Party and the people finally revealed the true colors of the more cunning and insidious Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique; this is a great victory for the Party and the people.
    On the ideological front, if the "third kind of people" can be regarded as the first batch of enemies clothed in Marxist garb, then we have no reason to say that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is the last batch. But we have confidence that under the leadership of the Communist Party, by increasing our vigilance a hundredfold, no matter how cunning the hidden elements are, they will definitely not be able to hide for long.
    Always firmly raise questions from the close combination of literature and art with current political tasks: this is a point that we should especially learn from Comrade Qu Qiubai.
    He raised the issue of popularizing literature and art especially sharply. He also wrote long poems in Shanghai dialect and Northern dialect (he titled them as random tunes, which means they can be sung at will), such as "Japanese Troops Are Sent" and "The Scene of the Battle in Shanghai" (this is the tune of "The Scenery of Wuxi"). His popular works and his articles on the popularization of literature and art were written during the "September 18th" and "January 28th" periods. During these periods, the people of Shanghai were angry and the revolutionary movement was surging, but our literary and art movement was still limited to the small circle of petty-bourgeois young intellectuals, far behind reality. The political task at that time required revolutionary and progressive writers to "immediately turn their faces to the masses, learn from the masses, and fight with the masses," to write in forms that the masses were familiar with and liked, and then they could seize the positions of the reactionary literature and art of the feudal and comprador bourgeoisie, which were "playing with the masses, deceiving the masses, and intimidating the masses" in various forms at the time. Of course, the issue of popularization is by no means merely an issue of coordinating with temporary political tasks. Comrade Qu Qiubai did not raise it in this way in his articles. The reason why I use it as an example of raising questions from the close combination of literature and art with current political tasks is to illustrate how this fundamental issue of the revolutionary literary and art movement becomes more urgent whenever the revolutionary situation develops, and Comrade Qu Qiubai is good at seizing such opportunities to promote theoretical and practical work and conduct ideological education for the vast literary and art circles.
    Comrade Qu Qiubai's contribution to the revolution is certainly not limited to literature and art. My short commemorative article can only talk about his brilliant achievements in literature from my own understanding. And what I have said is also extremely fragmented. Now the "Selected Works of Qu Qiubai" has been published. Let us carefully study his posthumous works and learn from him better! This is the best way to commemorate Comrade Qu Qiubai.

    纪念秋白同志，学习秋白同志
    茅盾
    六月十八日在我们的记忆中是一个沉痛的日子。
    瞿秋白同志是在二十年前的这一日，在福建长汀就义的。
    在这以前，上海就流传着一些十分矛盾的消息，——其中有些是敌人故意编造的，例如说他在狱中读佛经，而且还说自己是书生，从此将不问政治；或说他“意志消沉”，每天吟旧体诗，刻图章。敌人编造并散布这些谣言，当然有它的政治目的：一是借此诬蔑秋白，二是企图破坏秋白同志在当时的进步的知识分子中间的影响和威信，而且，也还企图通过这些谣言来动摇当时的在中国共产党思想领导下的青年知识分子的斗志。敌人是狡猾的，它编造的这些谣言，有点能使人将信将疑，因为秋白同志在成为马克思主义者、共产党员以前，是研究过佛典的，而多才多艺的秋白同志确也能旧体诗，善治印。
    和这一些相反的消息，那就不是说秋白同志已经遇害，便是说他已经逃脱了敌人的魔掌；这些，大概是关心秋白同志的好心肠人们的幻想和愿望
  （由此而来逃脱之说），或者预感（由此而来已经遇害之说）。
    敌人是能够正确地估计到秋白同志对于中国革命事业的作用，特别是对于革命文艺运动的作用的，这就是它为什么要编造那些谣言，而且直到秋白同志遇害以后还在继续编造呢！
    秋白烈士战斗的一生，是我们的典范。对于出生于本世纪初的在旧社会里经历过大半生涯的知识分子，“饿乡纪程”会给予很大的启发。这也许只是我个人的感受。但我确是先从“饿乡纪程”认识了秋白同志，而且是在这基础上发生了我对于他的尊敬和钦佩的。
    三十多年前，现在的五十多岁的人，当时被“十月革命”的炮声所惊醒，往往幻想着那个横跨欧亚两洲的大国在革命以后就该是一下子变成怎样一个极乐的世界。认为“就该是”，这是多么天真，多么幼稚；如果有人表示了不同的意见，那是一定要和他争得面红耳赤的。“饿乡纪程”和“赤都心史”却用“清醒的现实主义”（这个词儿是借用的，请勿以这个词儿的本义来解释这一句）教育了上面说的那些太幼稚太天真的人。这样做是有好处的；至少在当时。因为我看到过，有些抱着那样幻想的人，后来发见事实的发展不能一下子就符合他们的幻想，就觉得受了骗了（其实是他自己受了自己幻想的骗），于是从火热变成冰冷，甚至走上相反的道路。对于这样的人，我以为“饿乡纪程”和“赤都心史”可以医治他的病。至少，我是有过这样的经验；而亦因此，种下了我对于这位不相识的作者的敬仰的情绪。
      “饿乡纪程”和“赤都心史”“非常真挚地刻划了作者自己如何成为一个共产主义者的思想发展的过程”（引见“瞿秋白文集”序）。从“饿乡纪程”第四节，我们知道秋白同志在“受欧化的中学教育时候，……不期然而然同时‘名士化’，始而研究诗古文词，继而讨究经籍；大家还以‘性灵’相尚”。中学以后，“五四”运动前三年，“厌世观的哲学思想随着我这三年研究哲学的程度而增高。然而这‘厌世观’已经和我以前的‘避世观’不相同。渐渐的心灵现象起了变化。因研究国故感受兴趣，而有就今文学再生而为整理国故的志向；因研究佛学试解人生问题，而有就菩萨行而为佛教人间化的愿心。”
    他自称这时候的思想是“孤独生活中的‘二元的人生观’”。而他的“进俄文专修馆，而同时为哲学研究不辍，一天工作十一小时以上的刻苦生涯，就是这种人生观的表现”。“五四运动陡然暴发，我于是卷入漩涡。孤寂的生活打破了。……抱着不可思议的‘热烈’参与学生运动。”
    “当时爱国运动的意义，绝不能望文生义的去解释他。……学生运动倏然一变而倾向于社会主义……”“然而究竟如俄国十九世纪四十年代的青年思想似的，模糊影响，隔着纱窗看晓雾，社会主义流派，社会主义意义都是纷乱，不十分清晰的。……我以研究哲学的积习，根本疑及当时社会思想的‘思想方法’”，因而“离中国，入饿乡，秉着刻苦的人生观，求满足我‘内的要求’去了。”
    一个破产的“士的阶级”的家族的青年，曾经在所谓“东方文化”中求安身立命之道，在“五四”狂潮中，他的“思想第一次与社会生活接触”，终于发生强烈的“内的要求”，决然到新俄去。这“内的要求”就是为人民服务的坚决的意志和立场。这“内的要求”使他和过去的思想告别，完成了“成为一个共产主义者的思想发展的过程”。
    我是这样来理解秋白同志的“饿乡纪程”和“赤都心史”的。我并且以为，在这一点上，秋白同志的思想发展的过程，基本上是和鲁迅先生相同的；而后来他们两人之一见如故，结下深厚的友谊，除了他们俩在共同事业中是并肩作战的战友而外，我以为他们的在思想发展的过程上走过差不多相仿佛的道路，也是一个因素。他们俩互相是非常了解的。秋白同志对于鲁迅的了解之深刻，见于他的“‘鲁迅杂感选集’序言”。这一篇卓越的论文，对于当时的文艺界起了非常大的指导作用。
    大约是“五卅”运动上一年，秋白到了上海，住在闸北。我之能够常常向他请教，是在这时开始的。但那时候，他还不能把他的精力和时间多分出一些来指导文艺运动。有一件小事，现在我还记得。从这件小事可以看出他在那样忙碌的工作中，还是随时愿意帮助朋友，不肯拒绝朋友的琐屑的要求，而且用了极幽默的方式。那是郑振铎先生结婚的那天上午（结婚仪式是在下午举行的）。结婚证书上须要盖主婚人的章，大概是振铎把这事看得很郑重罢，在上一天写信给秋白同志，请他刻这个图章。可是在结婚那天上午，他接到秋白的一封信，里边一个便条是祝贺的话，另附一张他手写的“治印润例”，其中有一条，大意是说，为朋友刻印，不取酬，并可特别提前取件，以收件后二日为度。振铎收到这信，可真急了，因为主婚人（振铎的母亲）平日没有图章，而当天下午却非有主婚人的图章不可。正在这当儿，我到了振铎家里。他这时，“拉着黄牛就是马”，就要我来刻一个。可是又没有刻刀。我也好久不干这玩意，也没有工具。后来找到一把很小的起螺丝的钻子，打算将就对付着，但试一试还是不行。然而就在这时候，秋白的弟弟来了，说是给秋白带来了小小的礼物。拿出礼物，打开一看，赫然两枚图章，秋白弟弟说：秋白一早起来就动手刻，同时送出了那封开玩笑的信。
    这一件小事，我还记得，而且不嫌噜苏写在这里，因为我以为从这件小事也可以看见秋白同志的一个特点：热情、严肃之中，时时有幽默。后来在一九三二—一九三三年上海白色恐怖极度严重的时候，每次我见到他，他的谈吐总是那么安详，富于幽默感。这是革命乐观主义的自然流露。
    一九三一—一九三三年，以上海为中心的中国文艺战线上的剧烈的斗争，是和秋白同志的活动分不开的。先不说别的，单说他的忘我劳动的精神，就是我们应当永远学习的榜样。那时他是一个带病之身，而且环境的险恶使他不能定居，可是他写了那么多的论文，杂文，介绍翻译了那么多的马克思主义文艺理论和文学作品。
    在所谓“文艺自由”的论战中，所谓“文艺自由”，是当时的所谓“第三种人”为了向党所领导的左翼的和进步的文艺运动挑战而提出的反动的欺骗性的口号，关于这些自称为“第三种人”的人们（其实是蒋介石国民党在文化战线上的别动队），秋白同志发表了有名的论文：“文艺的自由和文学家的不自由”。这是一篇战斗性极强的论文，运用马克思主义文艺理论来分析批判当时文坛上的反动理论（所谓“文艺自由”）的实质，阐释了马克思主义文艺理论中的一些根本问题；这篇论文不但揭露了敌人的伪装，粉碎了敌人的反动理论对于广大文艺界的欺骗性的作用（值得注意，当时的这些反动理论也是披了马克思主义的外衣的），而且可以说是到那时为止的一篇最谨严、说服力最强的马克思主义文艺理论文章。它对于那时的文艺界的思想教育的作用是很大的。
      “第三种人”是披着马克思主义的外衣的，——当然，他们伪装得十分拙劣。而且他们自称“第三种人”，以示他们不是左翼，也不是右翼；他们这样做，当然是为了当时的具体环境要求他们这样以“中间人”姿态出现，以便发挥欺骗的作用。“第三种人”和胡风反革命集团比起来，真如小巫见大巫。胡风反革命集团不但伪装得更巧妙，而且尤其阴险可怕，因为它顶着左翼的帽子，甚至钻进了党内。但是，正像当年粉碎了“第三种人”一样，党和人民终于也揭露了更狡猾更阴险的胡风反革命集团的原形；这是党和人民的巨大胜利。
    在思想战线上，披着马克思主义外衣的敌人，如果“第三种人”可以算是第一批，那么，我们没有理由说胡风反革命集团就是最后的一批。但是我们有信心，在共产党领导之下，百倍地提高我们的警惕，那么，无论怎样狡猾的潜藏分子也是绝对藏不久的。
    永远坚定地从文艺同当前政治任务的密切结合上提出问题来：这是我们特别应当向秋白同志学习的一点。
    文艺大众化的问题，他提的特别尖锐。他还写了上海话和北方话的长诗，（他自题为乱来腔，即可随意唱的意思），“东洋人出兵”以及“上海打仗景致”（这是用的“无锡景致”的小调）等。他的这些大众化的作品以及他的几篇关于文艺大众化问题的论文，是在“九一八”和“一二八”的时期写的。这些时期，上海人心愤激，革命运动高涨，而我们的文艺运动还局限于小资产阶级青年知识分子的小圈子里，远远落在现实的后面。当时的政治任务要求革命的和进步的作家们“立刻回转脸来向着群众，向群众去学习，同着群众一块儿奋斗”，用大众所熟悉、喜爱的形式来写作，然后可以夺取封建、买办资产阶级的反动文艺的阵地，这些反动文艺当时正以各种各样的形式在“玩弄群众，蒙蔽群众，恐吓群众”。自然，大众化的问题决不是仅仅配合临时的政治任务的问题，秋白同志在他的那几篇文章中也不是这样提的，我之所以把它作为从文艺同当前政治任务的密切结合上提出问题来的例子，是想说明这一个革命文艺运动的根本问题怎样地在每逢革命形势开展时便愈感其迫切，而秋白同志是善于抓住这样的时机来推进理论和实践的工作，对广大文艺界进行思想教育的。
    秋白同志对于革命的贡献，当然不限于文艺。我这短短的纪念文却只能就自己的理解谈到他在文学上的光辉的成就。而且谈的也极为零碎。现在
  “瞿秋白文集”已经出版了，让我们仔细研读他的遗作，更好地向他学习吧！这是纪念秋白同志的最好的方法。　（六月十三日、北京）（附图片）
