When the Geological Survey Team Entered the Qilian Mountains
Wang Zhe

In April of this year, a newly formed survey team entered the Qilian Mountains and was warmly welcomed by the local people of all ethnic groups. The survey work was rapidly launched with the support of the local masses.

As soon as the comrades of the fourth detachment of the survey team arrived in the Yugur Autonomous Region, An Guanbushijia (Yugur), the chairman of the autonomous region, suggested that the survey team take a look at a natural copper mining area he knew about. Ma Laocang (Tibetan), the 58-year-old vice chairman, had grazed his livestock in the Shule River, Dubei River, and Ganzhou River areas since he was a child. He told the survey team in detail about what he knew in this area, saying that they could find mines there, and equipped the survey team with guides for each area. Following these guides, the survey team has found good metal mines in several areas.

Spring in the Qilian Mountains sometimes brings snowflakes. When the survey team arrived near the snow-capped mountains and had just pitched their tents on the snow, the local Yugur and Tibetan people ran over to tell them with concern that when staying in these areas, they must put Qingyang (blue sheep) skins on the ground to prevent dampness. But where could the newcomers find so many Qingyang skins? When the villagers learned of their difficulties, they voluntarily sent many Qingyang skins. The comrades of the survey team thanked them, but they said: Your good work is our happiness. In this area, horses are needed to climb mountains and cross depressions, but the southern comrades of the fourth detachment had never ridden horses before. The villagers found the most docile horses and taught them how to ride.

In Jinta County, Qilian Mountains, the comrades of the second detachment had to go to a Gobi desert area for a survey, which would take more than ten days back and forth. There was no water in that area, so they had to carry enough drinking water for people and animals. But before they set off, they had not found enough water buckets to carry water. When this news spread to the surrounding villages, people sent their own water buckets as soon as they heard that the survey team needed water buckets to find mines. The survey team wanted to rent them for money, but no one was willing to accept it. The comrades of this detachment had never ridden camels before. Before leaving, the villagers earnestly urged: Camels are not easy to ride at first, so be careful! The comrades of the survey team successfully discovered two precious ore outcrops in the Gobi Desert. When they happily returned to their original station, another good news was waiting for them - Zhao Fengtong, an old carpenter in the third district of Jinta, brought a piece of iron ore. According to him, he was herding camels in the Gobi Desert more than ten years ago. When the camels ran away, he chased them for two hundred miles and found the camels, and at the same time discovered an iron ore. He dedicated the ore sample that he had kept for so long to the survey team and volunteered to lead the way to see the mine.

On another occasion, the comrades of the second detachment of the survey team walked in the desert for seven days and heard that it was still four days away from a place with water, but they did not have much water left, and everyone was very worried. On the evening of this day, in the boundless desert, they saw a group of small black dots in the distance. The camel driver said: "There is a camel team coming over there." After walking for a while, they did meet a Mongolian camel team. The leader was a Mongolian youth in his twenties. When he heard that it was a survey team, he asked: "Are you thirsty? We have water here." They gave the comrades of the survey team the water they brought with them. In the desert area, this is the most affectionate expression. Everyone stayed together that night. The next morning, they specially led the survey team to get water before separating.

The warm and honest people of all ethnic groups in the Qilian Mountains, their meticulous help and care for the survey team, encouraged the survey team to overcome all difficulties and enhanced their confidence in completing the task.

    地质普查队进入祁连山区的时候
    王哲
    今年四月，一支新组成的普查队进入祁连山区，受到当地各族人民的热忱欢迎，普查工作在当地群众的支持下迅速开展。
    普查队第四分队的同志们一到裕固族自治区，自治区主席安官布什加（裕固族），就建议普查队去看看他所知道的一个自然铜矿区。五十八岁的副主席马老藏（藏族），从小在疏勒河、大北河、甘州河一带放牧，他把自己所知道的这一带的情况，详细地告诉了普查队，说他们在那里可以找到矿。并给普查队配备了每一个地区的向导。普查队跟着这些向导，已在几个地区找到了很好的金属矿。
    春天的祁连山有时还飘雪花。普查队走到雪山附近，刚在雪地上扎起了帐篷，当地裕固族、藏族人民就跑来关切地告诉他们，在这些地区住宿，一定要将青羊皮铺在地下，才能防潮。可是刚刚来到这儿的人们，到哪里去找那么些青羊皮呢？老乡知道了他们的困难，就自动送了很多的青羊皮来。普查队同志们向他们道谢，他们却说：你们作好了工作，就是我们的幸福。在这一带，上山爬洼需要骑马，可是第四分队的南方同志们，从来没有骑过马，老乡们就找了最驯服的马来，教给他们骑。
    在祁连山区的金塔县，第二分队的同志们要到一块戈壁滩上去普查，往返要十多天，那一带没有水，因此，他们必须携带充分的人畜饮水。但在他们出发前，还没找到足够的水桶驮水，这消息传到了四乡，人们一听说普查队找矿去需要水桶，都把自家的水桶送来了。普查队要出钱租用，但没有一个人肯要。这一分队的同志们过去也都没骑过骆驼，临行，老乡们谆谆嘱咐：骆驼开始不好骑，可要注意些啊！普查队的同志们胜利地在大戈壁上发现了两个珍贵的矿脉露头。当他们欣喜地回到了原驻地，一个好消息又在等待着他们——金塔第三区的一个老木匠赵凤桐，拿来了一块铁矿石。据他说：十几年前他在戈壁滩上放骆驼，骆驼跑了他去追，追了二百里路找到了骆驼，同时发现了一个铁矿。他把这保存了那末久的矿样献给普查队，而且自愿带路去看矿。
    又一次，普查队第二分队的同志们在沙漠里走了七天，听说离有水的地方还有四天的路程，但是带的水已不多了，大家心里很着急。就在这天的傍晚，在一望无边的沙漠中，远远看见有一群小小的黑点，驼夫说：“那边有驼队来了。”走了不久，果然遇见了一支蒙古族的驼队。普查队的同志们向他们招手，领队的是一个二十多岁的蒙古青年，听说来的是普查队，就问道：“你们渴了吧？我们这里有水。”他们把自己带的水，给普查队的同志们喝。在沙漠地区，这是最亲切的表示了。当夜，大家就住在一起。第二天清晨，他们特地带领普查队去取了水，才分手。
    祁连山区热情、敦厚的各族人民，对普查队无微不至的帮助和关怀，鼓舞了普查队克服一切困难的勇气，提高了他们完成任务的信心。
