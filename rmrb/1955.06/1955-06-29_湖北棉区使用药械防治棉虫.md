    Hubei Cotton Region Uses Pesticides and Equipment to Prevent and Control Cotton Pests

    In the cotton regions of Hubei Province, pesticides and equipment are widely used to prevent and control cotton pests. The three special districts of Jingzhou, Huanggang, and Xiaogan have purchased a total of 9,000 blower-type powder sprayers, and have also repaired existing sprayers. Xiangyang Special District's Sui County, Xiangyang, and other five cotton-producing counties have allocated more than 1,100 sprayers for lease to farmers. Many counties, such as Xishui, Jiayu, and Xinzhou, have taught methods of using "666" powder to control pests at technical training sessions. Farmers are highly motivated to control pests. In the Chengguan District of Xishui County, mainly women organized 70 pest control teams. In Baiyu Township, Hanchuan County, due to the vigorous prevention and control efforts of farmers, more than 3,600 mu of cotton fields have been treated for pests. (Yuan Jun)

    湖北棉区使用药械防治棉虫
    湖北省各棉区普遍使用药械防治棉田害虫。荆州、黄冈、孝感三个专区一共购进了九千架鼓风式喷粉器，同时还修理了旧有的喷雾器。襄阳专区随县、襄阳等五个产棉县调拨了一千一百多架喷雾器租给农民使用。浠水、嘉鱼、新洲等很多县，都在技术传授会上传授了使用“六六六”粉剂治虫的方法。农民治虫的积极性很高。浠水县城关区以妇女为主，组织了七十个除虫小组。汉川县白鱼乡因为农民大力防治，已经有三千六百多亩棉区除治了虫害。（袁军）
