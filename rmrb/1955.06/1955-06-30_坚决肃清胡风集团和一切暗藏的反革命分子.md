Resolutely Eliminate the Hu Feng Clique and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements

Cannot Allow Hidden Enemies to Conduct Sabotage Activities

A letter from the 22 members of Li Fenglan's group (National People's Congress representative, Hebei Province industrial labor model) in the fine yarn workshop of Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory: The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has such deep hatred for the people that they even wanted to whip us with a whip "wrapped in rubber with steel wire." Yes, in the old society, we workers personally tasted the whipping of such whips by special agents and bandits. How many brothers and sisters shed their blood and sacrificed their lives under the enemies' whips! We hate all counter-revolutionary elements to the core! The workers in our entire factory are working diligently to produce and carrying out a conservation movement; everyone feels sorry for wasting even an inch of yarn. The Hu Feng clique, however, is trying every means to dismantle our platform from the inside and sabotage our socialist construction. We must resolutely suppress them and completely destroy this counter-revolutionary clique. We demand that the government immediately severely punish Hu Feng, A Long, and other resolutely counter-revolutionary elements.

A letter from Wang Zhongshan of Huangshi Huaxin Cement Plant, Hubei Province: After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the newspaper, I feel extremely angry towards this group of counter-revolutionary elements. I remember my previous life: my family was driven out by landlords and local bullies and could not return home. My father died outside because of this, wrapped in straw and buried. My mother and I had no choice but to beg for food until 1950. Thanks to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we were able to return home after liberation. Now, when I think of these things, I hate the rule of the reactionaries who caused me these sufferings. Today, when we are embarking on an unprecedented path of happy life, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique still wants to restore the reactionary regime and make me live the dark life of the past. How can this be allowed? Thank you to the Party for exposing this counter-revolutionary clique. I demand that the government punish them according to the law.

In the past, my vigilance was not high, and my understanding of enemies similar to Hu Feng was unclear. I remember when I was in the army, we had a cultural instructor in our team. I worked with him for more than three years, and we had close contact. Sometimes when we chatted, I was not careful and told him things from inside the Party. Later, he was arrested, and I was very surprised. This person worked very actively, who knew he was a disguised counter-revolutionary element. I really regretted it at that time. Now I am an economic security worker, and I must learn from the past lessons, strengthen my political, professional, and cultural studies, and wage a resolute struggle against the counter-revolutionary elements lurking in our revolutionary ranks!

A letter from 159 staff members and workers attending the labor protection meeting in Tulihe, Inner Mongolia: We are holding a labor protection meeting in the border area of our motherland - the Greater Khingan Mountains. Reading the materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique from the newspaper, we feel extremely angry! Over the past few years, our forestry workers have been felling timber in the ice and snow of winter and the mud of summer, just to build our beautiful and happy socialist country together with the people of the whole country. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is sabotaging our socialist construction, therefore, he is the most dangerous enemy of our working class. Our forestry workers in Tulihe, together with the people of the whole country, actively participate in the struggle, demanding to completely crush this counter-revolutionary clique, and demanding the government to punish Hu Feng and the chief culprits in the Hu Feng clique according to the law!

Our forestry workers must also respond to the Party's call to raise vigilance and not allow any counter-revolutionary elements to find a hiding place in the forestry sector!

A letter from Zhang Wugeng of the State-owned Youyi Farm in Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province: I am a staff member of the State-owned Youyi Farm which is under construction. Now, we are reclaiming wasteland in the "Great Northern Wilderness" of our motherland day and night. We feel extremely resentful of the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. We demand that these counter-revolutionary elements be severely punished to defend our victory and socialist construction.

A letter from all the disabled revolutionary soldiers of the Wulongbei Revolutionary Disabled Servicemen's Sanatorium in Liaoning Province: We have heard from the radio and read in the newspapers about the three batches of materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and we feel extremely angry at these counter-revolutionary elements. We must not allow these extremely vicious guys to sabotage our happy life.

Some of us joined the Red Army as early as 1927, and some joined the revolutionary army during the Anti-Japanese War, the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. We shed our blood for the liberation of the people. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique wants to subvert our people's regime and sabotage our socialist construction from within. We revolutionary disabled soldiers will never allow it. We will raise our vigilance, resolutely eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology, and fight together with the people of the whole country to completely crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

A letter from Wu Ling of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation: I am currently a pregnant woman who is undergoing prenatal care and has been lying in bed for more than two months. Although I am fighting against illness every day, I have carefully read every line of the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily".

After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I know more clearly: it turns out that Hu Feng's master is imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang. I feel extremely angry at these counter-revolutionary bandits. I have not been a mother yet, but I can appreciate how difficult it is for a mother to raise a child. To enable children to grow up happily, there must be a strong motherland and a peaceful and happy living environment. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have finally obtained this happy life. I think that in order to successfully build a socialist society, for the sake of our children, we must resolutely crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. I hope that many of us mothers can also participate in this struggle and fight to defend the happy future of our children!

A letter from Zhou Lufeng of the Wuhan Purchasing Station of the Southwest Iron and Steel Company's Supply and Sales General Station: When I saw in the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique that Hu Feng's elements had been active in the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," I couldn't help but think back to the terrifying scene before the liberation of Chongqing in 1949. At that time, I personally saw special agents destroying factories throughout Chongqing: the sound of thunderous explosions never stopped, and the fire illuminated the entire mountain city like lightning. At the same time, in the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," special agents were carrying out a massacre of Communist Party members and progressive people. Many revolutionary martyrs and kind people were tortured to death by them with extremely cruel tortures - lye pools, mass graves, tiger benches, etc. At that time, anyone with a little conscience would grit their teeth in hatred for these crimes of the special agents! Now, these heinous executioners have mixed into our revolutionary ranks and are carrying out counter-revolutionary activities in secret. How can we tolerate this?

When I worked in the old society, I suffered beatings from special agents and the pain of unemployment and homelessness. I think that there are more than a million people who have suffered such pain in the old society? Thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and many revolutionary patriots for many years, we are able to have today's happy life. We should cherish and defend our achievements. Therefore, we must thoroughly eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements!

A letter from Chen Yunpiao, Li Zuixian, and other six staff members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission: We are a group of overseas Chinese students who grew up in imperialist colonies. Overseas, we, like many overseas Chinese, were subjected to oppression and bullying by U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. When we went to the liberated motherland, many overseas Chinese and classmates told us to work with the people of the whole country to build a great motherland.

Returning to the motherland, we saw that the overseas Chinese hometowns in various places have gradually shown a new look under the leadership of the people's government, the lives of overseas Chinese families have been guaranteed, overseas Chinese students who have returned to China have gone to school, and the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese have been protected by the motherland. Overseas Chinese have expressed their sincere gratitude and support for today's people's regime.

However, just as the people of the whole country and overseas Chinese are working hard in different work positions to build a socialist motherland, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is using all kinds of insidious and vicious means to sabotage and obstruct, vainly trying to overthrow our people's regime and restore Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. How can we not grit our teeth in hatred for this kind of counter-revolutionary crime!

The three batches of materials published in the "People's Daily" have fully proved that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is our class enemy. We demand that the government give them severe punishment.

Now, we further realize that the enemy will not sit still and wait for death, they will still make a dying struggle. The "People's Daily" has pointed out to us that other counter-revolutionary elements similar to the Hu Feng clique may still be hiding in our ranks. We must raise our vigilance, investigate all counter-revolutionary elements who have sneaked into the revolutionary ranks, and never let them "slip through"! At the same time, we must also tell the overseas Chinese families in our hometown to be vigilant at all times and strictly guard against the sabotage of all counter-revolutionary elements.

A letter from Hu Xiyin of Hujia Village, Dali County, Shaanxi Province: I am a peasant. I have never seen Hu Feng's eyebrows or eyes, nor have I read his articles. I don't know what kind of thing he is. After reading the secret letters written by Hu Feng to his clique members published in the newspaper, I realized that he is a complete and utter counter-revolutionary fellow. He is wholeheartedly trying to sabotage our happy life, trying to make us go back to the era of the Kuomintang rule with the old drums and old hammers, and suffer oppression again.

Thinking back to the time when Chiang's bandits ruled the world, I was exploited by others and lived a life of not having enough to eat or wear every year. It was commonplace to be beaten and imprisoned for failing to pay exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees. After liberation, the Communist Party saved me. Under the care and leadership of the Party and the government, life has become better day by day. Not only has life become better, but political awareness has also been raised. I can speak in front of people, and the clapper talk I compiled has also been published in the newspaper. The newspaper office also absorbed me as a correspondent. These things were impossible to dream of in the old society.

I love the new society, and the masses in our local area are also following the path pointed out by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I am very familiar with their thoughts, because I am a propagandist. Whenever the government has a policy, I tell them, and they are not only happy to hear it, but also do their best in the implementation. They understand that every move of the government is for the people to live a good life. Looking at mutual aid and cooperation again, except for landlords and rich peasants, 95% of the farmers in this village have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and the rest have also joined mutual aid groups, which shows that the people love the government. We sincerely support the government's policies.

Recently, I told the masses about Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary facts, and they all gritted their teeth in hatred. Poor peasant Hu Ansuo said:
  "I am seventy years old this year. I have lived enough of the suffering days in the old society. Don't say teach me to live that life again, even thinking about it gives me a headache. The government should take care of this bad guy as soon as possible!"

A letter from all the staff of the Compilation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: We believe that this exposure of the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a great victory for the revolutionary cause.

We are translators of Marxist-Leninist classics, and we firmly defend Marxist-Leninist thought and the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China. The Hu Feng clique is the mortal enemy of Marxism-Leninism. We must resolutely fight to the end against these double-dealers who wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism but engage in anti-Marxist-Leninist activities, and who carry the banner of revolution but engage in counter-revolutionary activities. We guarantee to the Party and the people that we will quickly and actively translate all the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, so that the people of the whole country can master this sharp weapon of Marxism-Leninism, and like holding a demon-revealing mirror, expose the original form of all counter-revolutionary elements who are cunningly wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism.

A letter from Li Yitong of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: I am a new recruit. I am only eighteen years old this year. In order to defend the coastal defense of the motherland, to defend the socialist construction of our country and the happy life of the people of the whole country, and to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and liberate Taiwan, the territory of the motherland, I actively responded to the call of the state to serve in the army. Therefore, when I saw the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily", I was really angry. We cannot allow these guys to sabotage the great motherland that we love and strive to defend.

I just joined the army this year. I must obey the leadership of my superiors, study hard to master the technology of modern weapons, exercise well, raise vigilance, always pay attention not to let the enemy sabotage our construction, and prepare to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, the territory of our country!

A letter from Zhi Zhujun, a student of Harbin Institute of Technology: After seeing the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily" on June 10, I couldn't restrain the anger in my heart. I couldn't help but think of the hard years nine years ago. At that time, I retreated with Yucai Middle School to Fuping County in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. In those days, we used washbasins to serve vegetables, and we used bean oil for lamps to smear our chapped faces; a wooden board was the blackboard, and our legs were the desks... We responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and gritted our teeth to overcome the difficulties. Our revolutionary war also won victory. It is precisely because of this that I can study in Harbin Institute of Technology, a new type of industrial university in the motherland today. We have spacious and comfortable buildings, excellent laboratories and libraries, and our lives are also rich and colorful. Whenever I think of our lives today, it fills me with unspeakable respect for many revolutionary martyrs and love for the happy life of today. However, Hu Feng, this unconscionable counter-revolutionary element, wants to take away this happy fruit from our hands and hopes that Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous group will make a comeback. We will never allow it! We demand that the judicial organs severely punish these counter-revolutionary elements!

A letter from Zhou Fakui, a carpenter of the Qingwan No. 19 Work Area of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways in Lanzhou, Gansu Province: I am a carpenter. Before liberation, generations of my family suffered. At that time, I did not have the opportunity to receive education, so I could not only not read newspapers, but I couldn't even write my own name. After liberation, I joined the work of the people's railway. Now, not only is my family living a happy life, but I have also turned over in culture. I can now write letters and read newspapers. After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng clique published in the "People's Daily", I fully recognized that Hu Feng and his lackeys are loyal running dogs of the US-Chiang bandit gang and the mortal enemies of our working people. I am very angry and I demand that the government resolutely suppress these counter-revolutionary elements and defend the happy days we have already achieved.

A letter from Han Yimin of a certain unit of the coastal defense of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang Front: My comrades and I have a common wish, which is to loyally defend our motherland and prepare all our strength to liberate Taiwan, the sacred territory of our country.

While we are watching the other side of the ocean and the sky of our motherland day and night, some disguised enemies have appeared behind us. They are trying to subvert our people's regime and let the reactionaries restore power. This is something we cannot tolerate. We will fight together with the people of the whole country to eliminate all enemies of the people and smash all the activities of counter-revolutionary elements.

A letter from all the technical staff of the Production and Technology Department of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry: After reading the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published continuously in the "People's Daily", we clearly realized that the Hu Feng clique is a counter-revolutionary clique hidden in the revolutionary ranks and the public enemy of the Chinese people.

We request the government to severely punish Hu Feng and the Hu Feng clique members who are obsessed with their wrongdoings according to the law.

The Hu Feng incident has given us a profound education. We further realize that with the vigorous development of the motherland's construction and the increasing strength of the people, the struggle between the enemy and ourselves will become more acute and complex. The iron and steel industry is an important link in socialist construction, and counter-revolutionary elements will never relax their sabotage of this sector. Therefore, in addition to actively participating in the struggle to crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we must also strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, always maintain a high degree of political vigilance, resolutely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and strive to realize the great national socialist industrialization.

Raise Vigilance and Do Not Let the Enemy Take Advantage of Loopholes

A letter from all the employees of the Triangle Fifth Survey Team of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission from the Chaoyi Construction Site in Shaanxi: We feel extremely angry at the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. We cannot lightly let go of these counter-revolutionary elements. We demand that the government give them the punishment they deserve. We guarantee to do our job well, raise vigilance, overcome all paralyzing and careless thoughts, and strive to defend the socialist construction of our motherland.

A letter from Fan Puzhai, Jiao Shizhai, Li Zheng, and other thirteen State Council counselors: At first, we only thought that the Hu Feng issue was a problem in the literary and art circles and did not pay enough attention to it. After seeing several batches of materials, we felt that this exposure was a major event and aroused our deep vigilance!

Hu Feng and the backbone elements of his clique have been running dogs of Chiang's bandits and special agents for many years. This group of counter-revolutionary elements is too rampant! Without resolutely and thoroughly crushing them and eliminating them, the people's anger cannot be calmed. We suggest that the government severely punish this group of mortal enemies of the people in accordance with the law!

We think that there must still be counter-revolutionary elements similar to the Hu Feng clique hiding, which should raise our vigilance even more. All of us should consciously assist the government in exposing these scum. Indulging counter-revolutionary special agents is being cruel to the people. Only by eliminating all counter-revolutionary special agents can we defend the people's cause and make the revolutionary regime more consolidated.

From the documents related to the Hu Feng incident, especially from the notes of the "People's Daily" in announcing the materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we are deeply inspired. The "People's Daily" said in the note to Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism": Hundreds of thousands of petty-bourgeois intellectuals are cooperating with the Communist Party of China and are willing to be led by the Party. We are part of these millions of people. But we feel that
  "cooperation" is not enough. We consciously and sincerely demand transformation, starting from scratch, first of all, to transform our minds and extricate ourselves from the quagmire of all idealistic philosophy. Only in this way can we truly "be led" and live up to the leadership.

A letter from Yu Huahu of Haiyang County Militia in Shandong Province: The Hu Feng incident has made me more aware of the arduousness and complexity of socialist construction and the acuteness of class struggle. But no matter how the counter-revolutionary elements play tricks, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the people's class consciousness has been greatly improved compared to before. The people are united. As long as our eyes are bright, we will be able to expose all the conspiratorial activities of the counter-revolutionary elements. On the evening of June 16, we held a militia meeting, re-examined the weapons, divided the squads, and took turns on guard every night to protect the wheat harvest. We will participate in the struggle of the people of the whole country to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionary elements with such practical actions.

A letter from Zhang Hengjun of the Dongsinian Hutong Public Security Police Station in Dongsi District, Beijing: The Hu Feng incident has given me a great education. At first, I thought this was just an ideological struggle in the literary and art circles and had nothing to do with myself. After the "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I realized that they were as hateful as the open enemies with guns. This incident made me feel that I was too paralyzed in the past. I am a public security worker in the people's capital. As a public security officer standing on the front line of the struggle against hidden enemies, this kind of paralyzing thought of mine is extremely harmful. I am determined to learn from this incident and guarantee that I will raise my political vigilance at all times and everywhere in the future, work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, constantly arm my mind, so as to strengthen and improve my work ability, and fight to suppress all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, to protect the safety of the capital and the smooth progress of socialist construction.

A letter from Zhang Jingyue, Li Ruqi, and other sixty faculty and staff members of the Department of Biology of Peking University: We are some people engaged in natural science work. When the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique began to be exposed, we naively thought that this was just an ideological struggle in the literary and art field and did not pay enough attention to this matter. After the first and second batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique were published, we felt that things were not that simple and began to pay attention. Then, the third batch of materials was published, and we opened our mouths wide, opened our eyes wide, and couldn't help but shout out: What fierce enemies!

Now everything is clear. Whatever we love, this group of counter-revolutionary elements hates. They are our enemies.

This struggle has profoundly educated us and awakened us from the paralyzing and careless dream. We have more concretely realized the intensification and complexity of the class struggle during the transition period. Our previous political sense of smell was too insensitive.

In the future, we must strengthen political study and improve our political awareness and political sensitivity. We are determined to unite more closely around the Party in the future, and together with the people of the whole country, strive to smash all the conspiratorial activities of counter-revolutionary elements and for the socialist construction of the motherland.

A letter from Chen Dingsha of the Central Academy of Drama: The Hu Feng incident has given us a great education. The Party newspaper reminded us: Liberalism is a good friend of counter-revolutionary elements. How worthy of our vigilance this is!

I am a staff member of the Central Academy of Drama. When the "People's Daily" published the second batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I noticed that the editor's note mentioned that Hu Feng's clique members used the name "Zhang Ji of the Central Academy of Drama" when communicating. I also remembered that Hu Feng also quoted an example of lecturing on "Dream of the Red Chamber" in the Central Academy of Drama in his "Opinion Paper", although it was distorted and did not match the facts, where did this "intelligence" come from? Isn't Hu Feng accustomed to asking his partisans for materials and intelligence in his secret letters? With the deepening of the movement, people's political sense of smell has become more and more sensitive. In this sharp class struggle, we have all been mobilized. I think everyone should pay attention to observing the enemy's situation and be careful whether there are tigers around you, and you can't sleep with tigers anymore!

As long as everyone quickly wakes up from paralysis and maintains a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, the hidden enemies will definitely be exposed.

A letter from Zhang Zhiguang and other six soldiers of a certain communications regiment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: We are soldiers defending the motherland. After reading the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique revealed in the newspaper, we feel extremely angry at the criminal activities of the Hu Feng clique. Comrades can understand our mood. For the liberation of the motherland and the socialist future, thousands of our close comrades sacrificed their lives on the battlefield. Before they sacrificed, they earnestly instructed us to completely and cleanly eliminate the enemies they did not have time to eliminate and complete our revolutionary cause. However, the Hu Feng clique is full of hatred for us and hopes for the restoration of the counter-revolutionary regime. We only hate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. We must be more vigilant and guard our great motherland!

A letter from Shen Xiaochu of Beijing School for the Blind: I am a blind person engaged in education for the blind. After listening to the facts about the Hu Feng clique's counter-revolution announced by the "People's Daily", I am very resentful of their crimes. I demand that the government severely punish the Hu Feng elements who resolutely refuse to repent. Because we blind people cannot see, generally speaking, we receive less cultural education and have a relatively low political level, so we should work harder to study, improve our awareness, raise our vigilance, and not let bad elements take advantage of our loopholes.

A letter from Sang Meilin of the Fourteenth District Office of Shouguang County, Shandong Province: I am a rural worker. In the past, I also thought: The Hu Feng clique's affairs are matters of the literary and art circles, which have little to do with us rural workers; as for exposing and punishing these bad guys, the Party and the higher-level government are responsible, and we don't need to worry about it. Because of this wrong idea, I have not shown enough concern for this serious class struggle. Since reading the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" published in the "People's Daily" on June 10 and the editorial of the same day, my mind has become clear. As the "People's Daily" editorial said: The Hu Feng incident "should arouse the vigilance of the people of the whole country and learn a lesson from this incident." We can no longer stand outside the struggle. Our comrades who work in rural areas must also raise our vigilance. There are also hidden counter-revolutionary elements in the countryside. Events that undermine unified purchase and sale, undermine agricultural production cooperatives, and undermine production still occur frequently. Our comrades who work in rural areas must also learn the ability to identify counter-revolutionary elements, so as to expose all counter-revolutionary conspiracies!

A letter from Zhao Cunlu, a member of the China Hui Culture Association: After reading the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily" and listening to the report on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and discussing it at the Second National Committee Meeting of the First Session of the China Hui Culture Association, I completely recognized the counter-revolutionary face of the Hu Feng clique. The Hu Feng incident has also given me a profound education. We must raise revolutionary vigilance, further strengthen national unity, and work together to build a socialist society, so that our motherland - the fraternal big family of all ethnic groups - will be more lovely, and our lives will be better!

A letter from Mao Yisheng and all the scientific workers and staff of the Railway Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways: Now it has been fully confirmed that the Hu Feng clique is a loyal running dog of the US imperialism and Chiang bandit gang and the mortal enemy of the people. Such a counter-revolutionary clique that hates the people must be severely punished according to the law.

Our scientific workers have been deeply influenced by bourgeois idealism in the past, and there are still many shortcomings and problems in our thinking, which will give counter-revolutionary elements an opportunity to take advantage of and easily be deceived and used by them. The Hu Feng incident has given us the most profound and vivid education. We can only study Marxism-Leninism hard, thoroughly transform our thinking, eliminate all idealistic filth in the field of scientific and academic research and other work, so that we can do a good job for the people and smash all the conspiratorial activities of counter-revolutionary elements.

A letter from Nian Shaoqin of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: I am a revolutionary soldier. The People's Liberation Army is the defender of the motherland. We must learn a lesson from the Hu Feng incident, raise our vigilance a hundredfold, closely monitor the enemy, and defend the precious revolutionary achievements that the people of the whole country have worked hard for more than a hundred years. We demand a thorough investigation of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, so that no counter-revolutionary element can escape!

A letter from Yin Sen, Ji Kesheng, Chen Lizhong, and other twenty-eight people from the Financial Department of the Ministry of Finance: When the movement to criticize Hu Feng's thought had just begun, it was generally thought that they were only ideological and literary and theoretical errors, and there was a lack of sufficient understanding of the anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary nature of Hu Feng. Some comrades even thought that this was a problem in the literary and art circles and adopted an indifferent attitude. It was not until reading the three batches of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily" that they further realized the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. They are a group of counter-revolutionary bandits who have close ties with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and they are thorough special agent organizations. Their heinous counter-revolutionary crimes must be severely punished. We can no longer tolerate it. We know that leniency towards the enemy is cruelty towards the people. We must resolutely crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and never let a single Hu Feng element escape.

A letter from all the faculty and students of the Beijing Dance School of the Ministry of Culture: The lesson we must learn from the Hu Feng incident is that we must strive to improve our revolutionary vigilance, for which we must strive to study Marxism-Leninism. At the same time, we must also overcome the liberalism and individualism that exist in our thinking, so that no enemy can take advantage of any gap. We should always remember that counter-revolutionary elements are always "peering in the direction" and want to get into our stomachs to sabotage us.

A letter from Zhao Jie, Fang Yu, and other eight people from the Rural Group of the "Hebei Daily" Editorial Department: The second and third batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique aroused our great anger. These two batches of materials stripped off the disguise of this counter-revolutionary clique and revealed its fox tail. The backbone of this clique headed by Hu Feng turned out to be a group of special agents hidden in the revolutionary camp. Hu Feng and many backbone members of the Hu Feng clique are unforgivable. We demand that these counter-revolutionary elements be severely punished in accordance with the law.

We are journalists. In addition to thoroughly exposing the crimes of this counter-revolutionary clique to the people, we must also draw profound lessons from this incident. On the one hand, we must conscientiously study dialectical materialism and criticize bourgeois idealism; on the other hand, we must always raise revolutionary vigilance and be wary of counter-revolutionary elements similar to the Hu Feng clique carrying out "heart-digging warfare" against us and throwing "cluster hand grenades" at us to defend the great victories we have achieved and will achieve.

A letter from all the members of the Shankou Agricultural Production Cooperative of Liangggezhuang Township, Jingxi Mining Area, Beijing: After hearing about the crimes of the Hu Feng clique against the Party and the people, everyone was very resentful. Because we will never forget the miserable days we lived under the oppression of landlords, local bullies, special agents, and bandit troops during the Kuomintang rule. At that time, we farmers worked for them all year round, but we lived a life of not having enough to eat or wear. After liberation, after the land reform, we were allocated land, and life became richer year by year. Last year, we also organized an agricultural production cooperative of 117 households. All our members are happily and diligently working every day for our better days - the early arrival of socialism. Everyone is full of optimism about the future. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, which has close ties with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, is trying to overthrow our people's regime, destroy our good days, and make the past miserable days come upon us again. We will never allow it, and we will never let the bitter days of the old society come back. We demand that the government severely punish the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique according to the law, protect our revolutionary achievements, and protect our good days. All our members unanimously passed a resolution at the members' meeting to support this struggle with active production, ensuring this year's agricultural production increase, and ensuring that our production cooperative is well run. We must also be vigilant at all times and smash all the conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements.

A letter from Huang Tao (returned overseas Chinese from Malaya) of Linqu Middle School, Linqu County, Shandong Province: What kind of person Hu Feng is, now the truth is out. It turns out that this despicable and shameless double-dealer has long been a loyal running dog of the US-Chiang bandit gang and has long been the enemy of the people.

In the past, we did not know his details and mistakenly thought that he was a "progressive writer." Many overseas Chinese living far away were also confused by his "theory." His fallacy of "where there is life, there is struggle" also deceived many young people among the overseas Chinese. Therefore, many patriotic overseas Chinese who originally wanted to return to the embrace of the motherland to participate in the motherland's large-scale economic construction canceled their plans to return to China to participate in construction under the influence of his rhetoric.

I feel extremely angry at the criminal activities of Hu Feng and his partisans. In order to defend our victorious achievements, to purify our revolutionary ranks, and for the interests of the country and the people, we returned overseas Chinese should immediately take action, actively participate in this struggle, raise our vigilance, and wage a relentless struggle against all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

A letter from seventy-seven cadres of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation: After seeing the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we cannot suppress our unparalleled anger. Their crimes are obvious. The backbone members of the Hu Feng clique are U.S. imperialists and Kuomintang special agents, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, and so on. Their hideous faces are finally exposed.

Hu Feng and Hu Feng's elements have always hated the people to the bone. They "do not do it, do not rest" with the revolution and want to resist to the end. They madly hate the new society and vainly hope that the people's regime will "perish" and that the counter-revolutionary regime will be restored. This is something the Chinese people will never allow.

We have already won a great victory, and we must continue to pursue the victory and thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, thoroughly eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and punish them according to the law.

A letter from all the teachers of the Physical Education Teaching and Research Group of Nankai University: The thorough exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is another major victory achieved by the Chinese people in the struggle against the enemy under the leadership of the Party. This victory not only exposed a counter-revolutionary clique that had been hiding in the people's camp for a long time and stopped their criminal activities, but also gave the people valuable experience and lessons.

Our comrades in the sports field must attach importance to this struggle, raise our vigilance, improve our political sense of smell

    坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
    不能容许暗藏敌人进行破坏活动
    唐山华新纺织工厂细纱车间李凤兰（全国人民代表大会代表、河北省工业劳动模范）小组二十二人来信：胡风反革命集团对人民的仇恨这样深，竟想用“橡皮包着钢丝”的鞭子鞭打我们。是的，在旧社会，我们工人就亲身尝受过特务匪徒用这样鞭子的鞭打，多少兄弟姐妹，在敌人的鞭打下面，流尽了鲜血，牺牲了生命！我们恨透了一切反革命分子！我们全厂的工人，都在兢兢业业地努力生产，开展节约运动，浪费了一寸纱头，大家都心疼。胡风集团却想尽办法从内部来拆我们的台，破坏我们的社会主义建设事业。我们一定要坚决地镇压他们，彻底摧毁这个反革命集团。我们要求政府立刻严厉惩办胡风、阿垅等坚决反革命的分子。
    湖北省黄石市华新水泥厂王忠山来信：看了报上刊登的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，我对这群反革命分子感到极大的愤怒。我曾记得我从前的生活：我的家人都被地主恶霸赶出在外，不能回家。我的父亲就因此死在外边，用稻草卷起埋了。我和母亲因为没有办法一直要饭要到一九五○年。幸亏党和毛主席的领导，我们才在解放后回到了家。现在，我想起这些事来，就非常痛恨使我受到这些苦难的反动派的统治。今天，当我们走上了从来未有的幸福生活道路的时候，胡风反革命集团还想使反动政权复辟，要我过从前的黑暗生活，这怎么能行呢？感谢党揭发了这个反革命集团，我要求政府依法惩办他们。
    过去我的警惕性是不高的，对和胡风类似的敌人是认识不清的。记得我在部队时，我们队上有个文化教员，我同他在一块工作了三年多，两人工作来往很密切。有时闲谈起来，我就不注意了，把党内的话都跟他说了。后来他被逮捕了，我还大吃一惊。这个人工作很积极，谁知他却是伪装起来的反革命分子，那时我真后悔。现在我是一个经济保卫工作者，我一定要接受过去的教训，加强政治、业务和文化的学习，好同潜伏在我们革命队伍内的反革命分子作坚决的斗争！
    参加内蒙古图里河劳动保护会议的职工一百五十九人来信：我们正在祖国的边疆——大兴安岭开劳动保护会议。从报纸上看到胡风反革命集团的材料，我们感到万分愤怒！几年来，我们林业工人在冬季的冰雪里，在夏季的泥泞里采伐木材，就是为了要和全国人民一起，建设我们美好幸福的社会主义国家。胡风反革命集团却在破坏我们的社会主义建设，因此，他是我们工人阶级最危险的敌人。我们图里河的林业工人也和全国人民一道积极参加斗争，要求彻底粉碎这个反革命集团，要求政府依法惩办胡风和胡风集团中的首恶分子！
    我们林业工人还要响应党的号召，提高警惕，不让一切反革命分子在林业部门得到隐身之地！
    黑龙江省集贤县国营友谊农场张五庚来信：我是正在建设中的国营友谊农场的一个工作人员。现在，我们正在祖国的“北大荒”不分昼夜地进行着垦荒工作。对于胡风反革命集团的罪行，我们感到无比的愤恨。我们要求给予这些反革命分子以严厉的惩办，以保卫我们的胜利果实和社会主义建设。
    辽宁省五龙背革命残废军人教养院全体残废军人来信：我们从广播中听到，从报纸上看到关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，对这些反革命分子感到极端愤怒。我们决不能容许这些毒恶透顶的家伙们破坏我们的幸福生活。
    我们之中有的是远在一九二七年参加红军的，也有的是在抗日战争时期、第三次国内革命战争时期、抗美援朝战争时期参加革命军队的。我们为了人民的解放，曾流出了鲜血。胡风反革命集团想颠覆我们的人民政权，从内部破坏我们的社会主义建设，我们革命残废军人决不容许。我们将提高警惕，决心肃清资产阶级思想影响，和全国人民一道，为彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团和肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子而斗争。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会吴凌来信：我现在是一个正在保胎的孕妇，躺在床上已经两个多月了。虽然我天天都在同疾病作斗争，但，“人民日报”所公布的关于胡风反革命集团的材料，每一行我都仔细地看过了。
    当我看完了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，更清楚地知道了：原来胡风的主子是帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石匪帮。对这些反革命匪徒，我感到了极大的愤怒。我还没有做过母亲，但我可以体会到母亲养育一个孩子是多么不容易。要使孩子们幸福地成长起来，就不能不有一个强大的祖国和和平幸福的生活环境。我国人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，好容易才获得了这种幸福的生活。我想，为了胜利地建成社会主义社会，为了我们的孩子，我们要坚决粉碎胡风反革命集团。我希望我们许多做母亲的，也都能参加到这个斗争中来，为保卫我们孩子的幸福前途而斗争！
    西南钢铁公司供销总站武汉采购站周陆飞来信：当我在关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料中看到胡风分子曾在“中美合作所”活动过的时候，不禁使我回想到了一九四九年重庆解放前夕的恐怖情景。那时候，我曾亲自看到特务分子破坏重庆全市工厂的情况：如雷的爆炸声没有停止过，火光像闪电似地照亮了整个山城。和这同时，在“中美合作所”，特务分子对共产党员和进步人士的大屠杀也在进行着。许多革命烈士和善良人民，都被他们用极残酷的毒刑——镪水池、万人坑、老虎凳等等，残害了。那时候，只要有一点点良心的人，谁也对特务分子们的这些罪行切齿痛恨！现在，这些万恶滔天的刽子手，又混进了我们革命队伍里，并在暗地里进行着反革命的活动，这叫我们怎么能够容忍呢？
    我自己在旧社会里做工的时候就曾遭受过特务的毒打，也受过失业流浪的痛苦。我想，在旧社会里受到过这样痛苦的人何止千百万呢？多亏中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，中国人民解放军和许多革命志士多年的英勇斗争，我们才能够有了今天的幸福生活。我们应该珍惜并保卫我们已取得的胜利。因此，我们必须彻底肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子！
    华侨事务委员会工作人员陈云飘、李最贤等六人来信：我们是一群生长在帝国主义殖民地的侨生。在海外，我们和许多侨胞一样，备受美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石特务的压迫和欺凌。当我们投奔解放了的祖国时，许多侨胞和同学都嘱咐我们，要我们和全国人民一道为建设伟大的祖国而努力。
    回到祖国，我们看到各地的侨乡在人民政府的领导下，已逐渐呈现出新的面貌，侨眷的生活已有了保障，回国的华侨学生都上了学，海外侨胞的正当权利和权益获得了祖国的保护。海外侨胞对今天的人民政权，纷纷表示衷心的感激和拥护。
    可是，正当全国人民和海外侨胞在不同工作岗位上，为建设社会主义的祖国而努力的时候，胡风反革命集团却在用尽各种阴险恶毒的手段，进行破坏、阻挠，妄想推翻我们的人民政权，让蒋介石反动统治复辟。这种反革命的罪恶活动，怎能不让我们切齿痛恨！
      “人民日报”公布的三批材料，已充分地证明了胡风反革命集团是我们的阶级敌人。我们要求政府给他们以严厉的惩处。
    现在，我们更进一步地认识到，敌人是不会束手待毙的，他们还要作垂死的挣扎。“人民日报”已向我们指出，其他类似胡风集团的反革命分子还可能隐藏在我们的队伍中。我们一定要提高警惕，清查一切钻进革命队伍来的反革命分子，绝不能让他们“滑过去”！同时，我们还要告诉家乡的侨眷们，叫他们时刻警惕着，严防一切反革命分子的破坏。
    陕西省大荔县扈家村扈西印来信：我是一个农民。胡风的眉眼，我没有见过，他写的文章也没有看过，不知道他是个啥东西。读了报纸登的胡风给他集团的人写的密信，才弄清了他是个十足不折不扣的反革命家伙。他一心想破坏我们的幸福的生活，想使我们原鼓旧槌地回到国民党统治的那个时代，重受压迫。
    回想蒋匪坐天下的时候，我受人剥削，年年过着吃不饱穿不暖的生活；为了交不起苛捐杂款，挨打、坐监是家常便饭。解放后，共产党救活了我，在党和政府的关心和领导下，日子一天比一天过好了。不单生活过好了，政治认识也提高了，在人前面能说话，我编的快板也上了报，报社还吸收我做了通讯员。这些事，在旧社会里是做梦也梦不到的。
    我热爱新社会，我们当地的群众也是跟着共产党和毛主席指的道路走的。他们的心思我很熟悉，因为我是个宣传员，每当政府有政策，我就讲给他们听，他们不但听了高兴，而且在执行中也是尽力的。他们明白政府的一举一动都是为人民过好光景的。再看看互助合作吧，这个村除了地主、富农以外，百分之九十五的农户加入了农业生产合作社，余下的也都参加了互助组，这说明了人民热爱政府。政府的政策我们都是衷心地拥护的。
    最近，我把胡风反党、反人民、反革命的事实讲给群众听，他们一致咬牙痛恨。贫农扈安锁说：
  “我今年七十岁了，旧社会的苦难日月过够了，不要说教我再过那个日子，就是想一下也要头疼。政府应该把这个坏货趁早拾掇了！”
    中共中央马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作编译局全体工作人员来信：我们认为这次对胡风反革命集团罪行的揭露，是革命事业的一大胜利。
    我们是马克思列宁主义经典著作的翻译工作者，我们坚决保卫马克思列宁主义思想，保卫马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利。胡风集团是马克思列宁主义的死敌，我们要同这些披着马克思列宁主义外衣而进行反马克思列宁主义活动、打着革命的招牌而进行反革命勾当的两面派分子坚决斗争到底。我们向党和人民保证，我们要迅速地积极努力地将马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的全部著作翻译出来，让全国人民掌握马克思列宁主义这一锐利武器，像拿着照妖镜一样，把一切狡猾地披着马克思列宁主义外衣的反革命分子的原形照出来。
    中国人民解放军某部栗宜桐来信：我是一个新入伍的战士。我今年才十八岁。为了保卫祖国的海防，保卫我国的社会主义建设和全国人民幸福的生活；为了消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放祖国的领土台湾，我积极地响应国家号召来服兵役。因此，当我看到“人民日报”公布的胡风反革命集团的罪恶后，真气坏了。我们不能容许这些家伙来破坏我们所热爱并努力来保卫着的伟大祖国。
    我今年才刚入伍。我一定要服从上级的领导，好好学习掌握现代化武器的技术，练好身体，提高警惕，随时注意着不让敌人来破坏我们的建设，并准备着为解放我国的领土——台湾而斗争！
    哈尔滨工业大学学生治竹君来信：看到了六月十日“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，我抑制不住我心头的愤怒。我不禁想起了九年前的艰苦岁月。那时候，我随育才中学撤退到晋察冀边区的阜平县。在那些日子里，我们用洗脸盆打菜，用点灯的豆油涂抹冻裂了的脸；一块木头板就是黑板，腿就是桌子……。我们响应党中央的号召，咬紧牙关渡过了难关。我们的革命战争也赢得了胜利。也正是这样，今天我才能在祖国的新型的工业大学——哈尔滨工业大学里读书。我们有宽大舒适的大楼，有很好的实验室和图书馆，我们的生活也是丰富多采的。每当我想起我们今天的生活，都使我对许多革命先烈们有着说不出的崇敬，并热爱今天幸福的生活。但是，胡风这个丧尽天良的反革命分子，却想从我们的手中夺走这幸福的果实，希望蒋介石卖国集团卷土重来。我们绝不允许！我们要求司法机关一定要严惩这些反革命分子！
    铁道部第一工程局甘肃兰州青石湾第十九工区木工周发奎来信：我是一个木工。解放前，自我以上几辈子都是受苦的人。那时候，我得不到受教育的机会，所以不但看不懂报纸，连自己的名字也写不出来。解放后，我参加了人民铁路的工作。现在，不但自己一家生活过得美满，在文化上也翻了身。我已能写信，也能看报了。看了“人民日报”刊出关于胡风集团的第三批材料后，我完全认清了胡风和他的喽啰们是美蒋匪帮的忠实走狗，是我们劳动人民的死敌。我真气愤极了，我要求政府坚决镇压这些反革命分子，保卫我们已经取得的幸福的日子。
    中国人民解放军浙江前线海防某部韩逸民来信：我和我的战友们都有着一个共同心愿，就是要忠心耿耿地保卫我们的祖国并准备好一切力量，去解放我国的神圣领土台湾。
    当我们昼夜注视祖国海洋的彼岸和天空的时候，而在我们的背后却出现了一些披着伪装的敌人，他们企图颠覆我们的人民政权，让反动派复辟。这是我们不能容忍的。我们将和全国人民一道，为消灭一切人民的敌人，粉碎一切反革命分子的活动而斗争。
    重工业部钢铁工业管理局生产技术处全体技术人员来信：读了“人民日报”连续发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料以后，我们清楚地认识到胡风集团是暗藏在革命队伍中的反革命集团，是中国人民的公敌。
    我们请求政府依法严惩胡风和执迷不悟的胡风集团分子。
    胡风事件使我们受到了深刻的教育。我们更进一步认识到随着祖国建设事业的蓬勃发展，人民力量的日益壮大，敌我斗争将愈加尖锐和复杂。钢铁工业是社会主义建设的重要环节，反革命分子是决不会放松对这个部门的破坏的。因此，我们除积极参加粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争外，还必须加强学习马克思列宁主义，时刻保持高度的政治警惕性，坚决肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，为实现伟大的国家社会主义工业化而斗争。
    提高警惕，不让敌人钻空子
    黄河水利委员会三角第五测量队全体员工自陕西朝邑工地来信：我们对胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动，感到极大的愤怒。我们不能轻轻放过这些反革命分子。我们要求政府给他们以应得的惩处。我们保证做好我们的工作，并提高警惕，克服一切麻痹大意思想，为保卫我们祖国的社会主义建设而奋斗。
    国务院参事室范朴斋、焦实斋、李蒸等十三人来信：我们对胡风问题，最初也只认为是文艺界的问题，并未引起足够的重视。看到几批材料后，我们感到这一揭发真是一件大事，引起了我们深刻的警觉！
    胡风及其集团的骨干分子，原来多年以来就是蒋匪帮的走狗——特务。这一伙反革命集团分子，真太猖狂了！不坚决彻底地粉碎他们、消灭他们，人们的愤怒是不能平息的。我们建议政府对这一伙人民的死敌，按照法律予以严厉的惩处！
    我们想，类似胡风集团的反革命分子，一定还有潜藏，这就更该提高警惕。我们全国人民都应该自觉地协助政府揭发这些败类。对反革命特务的姑息，便是对人民的残忍。只有肃清一切反革命特务，才能保卫人民的事业，使革命的政权更加巩固。
    从有关胡风事件的文件中，尤其从“人民日报”在公布胡风反革命集团材料的历次按语中，我们深深得到启发。“人民日报”在胡风的“我的自我批判”那篇文字的按语中说：成千成万的小资产阶级知识分子是和中国共产党合作并愿意受党领导的。我们，正是这千万人中的一部分。但我们感到，
  “合作”还不够，我们自觉地诚恳地要求改造，一切从头来过，首先要改造思想，从一切唯心哲学的泥坑中自拔出来。只有这样，才是真正“受领导”，才不辜负领导。
  山东省海阳县民兵于化虎来信：胡风事件使我更加认识了社会主义建设的艰巨性、复杂性，阶级斗争的尖锐性。但不管反革命分子怎样玩弄花样，在毛主席的英明领导下，人民的阶级觉悟比从前大大提高了，人民是团结一致的，只要我们的眼睛明亮，我们就能够揭露一切反革命分子的阴谋活动。六月十六日晚上，我们开了个民兵会，重新检查了武器，划分了小队，每晚轮流放哨，保卫麦收。我们将以这样的实际行动，来参加全国人民肃清暗藏的反革命分子的斗争。
    北京市东四区东颂年胡同公安派出所张衡钧来信：胡风事件使我受到很大教育。最初，我曾以为这不过是文艺界的思想斗争，和自己没有什么关系。等到“人民日报”公布了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，我才明白，他们是和公开的拿枪的敌人一样可恶的。这件事使我感到自己在过去是太麻痹了。我是人民首都的一个公安工作者。作为站在对隐蔽敌人斗争最前线的公安人员来说，我这种麻痹思想是极其有害的。我决心从这次事件中吸取教训，并保证今后随时随地提高政治警惕性，努力学习马克思列宁主义，不断地武装自己的头脑，以加强和提高自己的工作能力，为镇压一切暗藏的反革命分子，为保卫首都的安全和社会主义建设事业的顺利进行而斗争。
  北京大学生物系教职员张景钺、李汝祺等六十人来信：我们是一些从事自然科学工作的人。当胡风反革命集团的罪行开始被揭发的时候，我们曾经天真地认为这只是文艺方面的思想斗争，对这件事不够重视。关于胡风反革命集团的第一、二两批材料公布以后，我们才感觉到事情不是那样简单的，才开始注意起来。接着，第三批材料又公布了，我们才张大了嘴巴，瞪起了眼睛，不由地喊了出来：好凶恶的敌人呀！
  现在一切都明白了。凡是我们所喜爱的，便是这一伙反革命分子所憎恨的。他们是我们的敌人。
    这次斗争深刻地教育了我们，使我们从麻痹大意的睡梦中醒悟过来。我们更具体地体会到过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐化和复杂化。我们以前的政治嗅觉太不敏锐了。
    今后我们一定要加强政治学习，提高我们的政治觉悟和政治敏感。我们决心今后更紧密地团结在党的周围，同全国人民一道，为粉碎一切反革命分子的阴谋活动，为祖国的社会主义建设而努力。
    中央戏剧学院陈丁沙来信：胡风事件使我们受到了很大教育。党报提醒我们：自由主义是反革命分子的好朋友。这多么值得我们警惕啊！
    我是中央戏剧学院的一名工作人员，在“人民日报”公布关于胡风反革命集团的第二批材料时，我注意到编者按语中提到：胡风集团分子通信时，用过“中央戏剧学院张寄”的名义。我还想起胡风的“意见书”中也引用过一个关于中央戏剧学院讲“红楼梦”的例子，虽然是歪曲了的，和事实并不相符，但这个“情报”又是从那里传出去的呢？胡风在他的密信中不是惯于向他的党羽要材料，要情报吗？运动深入开展，人们的政治嗅觉也一天比一天敏感起来了。在这一场尖锐的阶级斗争中，我们都动员起来了。我想每个人都应该注意观察一下敌情，当心你身边有没有老虎，不能同老虎再睡在一起了！
    只要每个人都赶快从麻痹中清醒过来，保持高度的革命警惕，暗藏的敌人是一定会被揭露的。
    中国人民解放军某部通讯团战士张之广等六人来信：我们，是捍卫祖国的战士，看到了报纸所揭发的胡风反革命集团的材料以后，对胡风集团的罪恶活动，感到无比的愤怒。我们的心情，同志们是可以理解的。为了祖国的解放和社会主义的未来，我们千万个亲密的战友在战场上献出了自己的生命。他们临牺牲前，还谆谆地嘱托我们，让我们彻底地干净地消灭他们还没有来得及消灭的敌人，完成我们的革命事业。但是，胡风集团却对我们充满了仇视，期望着反革命政权的复辟。我们对于胡风反革命集团，只有痛恨。我们要更加提高警惕，守护我们伟大的祖国！
    北京市盲童学校沈晓初来信：我是从事盲人教育工作的盲人。在听了“人民日报”所公布的关于胡风集团反革命的事实后，对他们的罪行，非常痛恨。我要求政府严厉惩办坚决不肯悔改的胡风分子。我们盲人，因为眼睛看不见，一般来说，文化教育受的少，政治水平比较低，所以应该格外努力学习，提高觉悟，提高警惕性，不让坏分子钻我们的空子。
    山东省寿光县十四区区公所桑美林来信：我是一个农村工作人员。过去，我也曾想：胡风集团的事是文艺界的事情，对我们做农村工作的人来说，没有多大关系；至于揭露和惩办这些坏分子，有党和上级政府负责，也用不着我们去操心。由于有着这个错误的想法，便对这一场严重的阶级斗争表现得不够关心。自从读了“人民日报”六月十日公布的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”和当天的社论后，脑子清醒了。正如“人民日报”社论所说的：胡风事件“应当引起全国人民的警惕，并从这个事件吸取教训”。我们再不能置身斗争之外了。我们做农村工作的同志也要提高警惕。农村中同样有暗藏的反革命分子。他们破坏统购统销，破坏农业生产合作社，破坏生产的事件还常有发生。我们做农村工作的同志同样要学会辨别反革命分子的本领，以便把一切反革命的阴谋揭露出来！
    中国回民文化协进会委员赵存禄来信：读了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，又在中国回民文化协进会第一届第二次全国委员会议上听取了关于胡风反革命集团的报告并进行了讨论后，我彻底地认清了胡风集团的反革命面目。胡风事件也使我受到了深刻教育。我们一定要提高革命警惕性，进一步加强民族团结，一起为建设社会主义社会而共同努力，让我们的祖国——各民族的友爱大家庭更加可爱，让我们的生活更加美好！
    铁道部铁道研究所茅以升等全体科学工作者及职工来信：现在已完全证实了胡风集团是美帝国主义和蒋匪帮的忠实走狗，是人民的死敌。对这样仇恨人民的反革命集团，必须依法给以严惩。
    我们科学工作者，由于过去受到资产阶级唯心主义的影响较深，思想上还有着很多缺点和毛病，这样就会给反革命分子以可乘之机，容易受他们的欺骗利用。胡风事件，使我们受到了一次最深刻最生动的教育。我们只有努力学习马克思列宁主义，彻底改造思想，清除科学学术领域及其他工作中一切唯心主义的污毒，才能够为人民做好工作，才能够粉碎一切反革命分子的阴谋活动。
    中国人民解放军某部年少勤来信：我是一个革命军人。人民解放军是祖国的保卫者，我们一定从胡风事件中吸取教训，百倍提高警惕，严密监视敌人，保卫全国人民百余年来艰辛奋斗所获得的宝贵的革命成果。我们要求对胡风反革命集团做彻底追查，不使一个反革命分子漏网！
    财政部殷森、纪克绳、陈利中等二十八人来信：当批判胡风思想运动刚一展开的时候，一般还以为他们只是思想上和文艺理论上的错误，对于胡风反党、反人民、反革命的本质，缺乏足够的认识，有些同志甚至以为这是文艺界的问题，采取漠然置之的态度，及至读了“人民日报”发表的胡风反革命集团的三批材料，才进一步认识到胡风反革命集团的真面目。他们是一伙同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的反革命匪徒，是彻头彻尾的特务组织。他们滔天的反革命罪恶，必须受到严厉的惩处。我们再也不能容忍。我们知道对敌人的宽大，就是对人民的残忍。我们必须坚决粉碎胡风反革命集团，决不让胡风分子一个漏网。
    文化部北京舞蹈学校全体教职学员来信：从胡风事件中我们必须吸取的教训，就是必须努力提高我们的革命警惕性，为此就必须努力学习马克思列宁主义。同时，也必须克服我们思想上存在的自由主义，个人主义思想，使任何敌人无隙可乘。我们应该时时记住：反革命分子是随时在“窥测方向”的，而且要钻进我们的肚皮里来破坏我们的。
      “河北日报”编辑部农村组赵杰、方育等八人来信：揭发胡风反革命集团的第二批和第三批材料，激起了我们极大的愤怒。这两批材料，剥去了这个反革命集团的伪装，露出了它的狐狸尾巴。以胡风为首的这个集团中的骨干，原来是藏在革命阵营的一批特务。胡风和胡风集团的许多骨干分子是罪不容恕的，我们要求依法严办这些反革命分子。
    我们是新闻工作者。我们除了要彻底向人民揭发这个反革命集团的罪行以外，并要深刻地从这个事件中吸取教训，一方面要认真学习辩证唯物主义，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想；一方面要时刻提高革命警惕性，警惕类似胡风集团的反革命分子向我们进行“挖心战”，向我们抛掷“集束手榴弹”，以保卫我们已经取得的和将要取得的伟大胜利。
    北京市京西矿区良各庄乡山口农业生产合作社全体社员来信：我们听到胡风集团反党、反人民的罪行后，每个人都非常愤恨。因为我们永远也忘不了在国民党统治时期，我们在地主、恶霸、特务、匪军的压迫下所过的悲惨日子。在那时候，我们农民整年给他们劳动，但是我们过的是吃不饱穿不暖的生活。解放后，经过土地改革，我们分到了土地，日子一年比一年富裕了。去年我们又组织了一百一十七户的农业生产合作社，我们全体社员每天都在为我们更好的日子——社会主义的早日到来而愉快地辛勤地劳动着，我们每个人对前途都充满了乐观。而同帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮有着密切联系的胡风反革命集团，却企图推翻我们的人民政权，破坏我们的好日子，使过去的悲惨日子再临到我们身上来，我们决不能容许，我们决不能让旧社会的苦日子再回来。我们要求政府依法严厉地惩治胡风反革命集团，保护我们的革命果实，保护我们的好日子。我们全体社员在社员大会上一致通过，要以积极生产，保证今年的农业增产和保证搞好我们的生产合作社来支持这个斗争。我们并要时刻提高警惕，粉碎一切反革命分子的阴谋。
    山东省临朐县临朐中学黄涛（马来亚归侨）来信：胡风究竟是什么样的人，如今真相大白了。原来这个卑鄙无耻的两面派分子早就是美蒋匪帮的忠实走狗，早就是人民的公敌了。
    过去，我们不了解他的底细，错误地认为他是“进步作家”。远居在海外的侨胞也有不少人为他的“理论”所迷惑。他的“那里有生活，那里就有斗争”的谬论，也使华侨中的不少青年受了蒙蔽，因此，有不少原想回到祖国的怀抱中来参加祖国大规模的经济建设的爱国华侨们，在他的这种论调的影响下，取消了回国参加建设的念头。
    对于胡风和他的党羽们的罪恶活动，我感到万分的愤怒。为了保卫我们的胜利果实，为了纯洁我们的革命队伍，为了国家和人民的利益，我们归国华侨应该立刻行动起来，积极地投入到这一斗争中去，提高警惕，同一切暗藏的反革命分子作无情的斗争。
    北京市民主妇女联合会干部七十七人来信：看到关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，我们按捺不住我们的无比愤怒。他们的罪行昭然若揭。胡风集团的骨干分子是美帝国主义和国民党的特务、反动军官、托洛茨基分子等等。他们的狰狞面目终归暴露了。
    胡风以及胡风分子一贯仇恨人民入骨。他们对革命“一不做，二不休”，要顽抗到底。他们疯狂地憎恨新社会，妄想人民政权“灭亡”，使反革命政权复辟。这是中国人民决不允许的。
    我们已经获得了很大胜利，我们还必须继续乘胜直追，彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，彻底清除一切暗藏的反革命分子，并对他们依法惩办。
    南开大学体育教研组全体教师来信：胡风反革命集团的被彻底揭露，是中国人民在党的领导下，对敌斗争所取得的又一重大胜利。这一胜利不但揭露了一个长期隐蔽在人民阵营中的反革命集团，制止了他们的罪恶活动，而且给了人民以宝贵的经验和教训。
    我们体育界的同志一定要重视这个斗争，提高警惕，提高政治嗅觉，在党的领导下，坚决肃清一切混在我们队伍中的反革命分子。我们也一定要更好地学习马克思列宁主义，进一步批判体育界的资产阶级唯心主义思想，学习苏联先进的体育理论和经验，搞好教学改革工作，坚决贯彻体育为生产和国防服务的目的。
    华东师范大学中国语言文学系教师许杰等四十三人来信：我们是一群文学教育工作者。最近我们接连读了“人民日报”上揭露胡风反革命集团阴谋活动的有关材料以后，对胡风集团的罪行，无不表示极端的愤怒！
    特别值得我们惊心的是胡风的反革命集团不仅打进了许多革命团体，而且也打进了我们高等学校文艺教学的讲坛，贾植芳和阿垅就是最明显的例子。为了爱护我们社会主义的教育事业，我们必须同胡风反革命集团进行坚决的斗争。
    从胡风集团反革命事件中我们必须吸取严重的政治教训。我们必须清除每人身上的个人主义、自由主义思想，加紧学习马克思列宁主义，加强我们的思想武装，提高革命的政治警惕性，善于辨别那些混在革命阵营内的伪装革命的反革命分子，同他们随时随地展开不妥协的斗争！
    我们要求彻底清查胡风及其反革命集团的罪恶活动，给胡风和胡风集团的坚决反革命分子以最严厉的惩办！
    严厉镇压执迷不悟的反革命分子
    重工业部地质局南京勘探公司八○四勘探队地质师张顺才等九人来信：我们是一群从事地质工作的青年，看了“人民日报”先后公布的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料后，我们有抑制不住的怒火。我们要求依法严惩反革命头子胡风及他的集团中的骨干分子。
    正当全国人民为建设社会主义而忘我劳动的时候，正当我们日夜战斗在深山探寻祖国地下资源的时候，胡风反革命集团却向党和人民展开了疯狂的进攻。这是多么恶毒和无耻！
    胡风反革命集团的被揭露，是党在政治上的重大胜利。这证明阶级敌人无论用什么卑鄙狡猾的伎俩，都是不能得逞的。一切胡风分子只有低下头来向党彻底坦白交代，不然人民是不会宽恕的！
    甘肃省兰州市小北前街十三号张天一、庄灿来信：我们是革命军属。从“人民日报”上读到胡风反革命集团的密信后，简直是五中为裂，愤慨不止。
    胡风反革命集团，有组织，有后台老板，他是人民的死敌。
    为了我们祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，我们人民必须加强政治嗅觉，提高革命警惕，彻底粉碎反革命分子的阴谋活动。我们给我们在华东滨海地区的儿子写信，要他们在思想上武装起来，百倍警惕地肃清隐藏在各个角落的反革命分子。
    我们要求政府对反革命首恶分子胡风和至今犹执迷不悟的胡风集团分子严加制裁。
    北京大学中国语言文学系杨晦、游国恩等一百一十四人来信：看了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，我们对这帮反革命匪徒充满了无比的愤怒和仇恨！我们坚决要求政府，对罪大恶极的反党、反人民、反革命的胡风及其集团中的首要分子立即逮捕，进行公审，严厉镇压，把这个暗藏的反革命集团彻底粉碎！
    通过胡风事件，我们更认识到中国共产党的英明、正确和伟大。这是我们人民的一大胜利，是革命事业的一大胜利。为了继续肃清一切暗藏的敌人，我们北京大学中国语言文学系全体教师、全体进修教师、全体研究生决心提高政治警惕，在党的领导下学好马克思列宁主义，为社会主义革命建设事业奋斗到底。
    辽宁省沈阳市苏家屯结核症防治院于泰丰来信：我是一个卧床不起的重病人。我的手虽然在痉挛，也要写这篇短文来声讨胡风，参加到这一斗争中来。有多少青年被胡风分子们的“蒙汗药”所麻醉，有多少人在走向解放区的途中，被胡风的“理论”拉了回来，这些披着伪装的反革命分子们给革命事业造成的损害实在是难以估计的。现在一切问题都明白了：原来胡风的主子就是帝国主义蒋介石，胡风和他的喽啰们很早以来就是同国民党特务机关有着密切联系的。他们妄想潜伏下来，从内部来瓦解人民民主政权。可是告诉胡风分子们，你们的算盘打错了，在强大的人民力量面前，你们的阴谋得逞不了。我要求政府一定要把胡风分子的反革命活动追查清楚，依法给以惩办。
    哈尔滨车站朱永福、李瑞卿等十人来信：我们是铁路工人。我们怀着愤怒的心情一篇接一篇地看过了关于胡风集团的材料，这些材料铁一般地证实了胡风反党集团的反党反人民反革命阴谋。
    胡风集团企图推翻人民革命政权，我们工人阶级是不能容忍的。我们要求政府将胡风及其他首恶分子立即逮捕，进行必要的处理。
    北京矿业学院僮族学生杨宝祥、危流渊来信：胡风反革命集团是各族人民的公敌，我们决不容忍阴谋破坏我们社会主义建设的反革命分子在那里“乐观”。我们建议人民政府对胡风及其反革命集团的首恶分子依法严厉镇压，决不让它们“装死躺下”。
    中国人民解放军空军某部王学胜、何宝升来信：我们以一次比一次更加愤怒的心情看完了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料。这三批材料，完全证实了胡风反革命集团是蒋介石卖国集团的忠实走狗。
    我们是人民解放军的战士，是社会主义建设的捍卫者。我们决不容许这些家伙们再明目张胆地破坏革命事业。我们要求彻底肃清和粉碎胡风反革命集团，严厉镇压和惩处胡风和胡风反革命集团中一切死不悔改的分子。
    中国铁路工会全国委员会生产部、工资部全体工作人员来信：我们读过“人民日报”陆续发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料后，我们的愤怒和痛恨是无法抑制的。
    胡风反革命集团进行反革命活动的主要目标是对着中国工人阶级及其先锋队——中国共产党。他们诋毁并妄图取消中国工人阶级的思想武器——马克思列宁主义和颠覆中国工人阶级领导的人民政权。胡风集团的反革命分子阿垅就曾在天津的工人中散布了他们的极端反动的“文艺理论”，企图毒化工人阶级。他们是工人阶级的大敌。我们对这些来历如此肮脏的阶级敌人必须严厉镇压，绝不宽容。对这些满身毒菌、腐蚀革命肌体的“苍蝇”、
  “蚊子”“蛆虫”必须彻底捕灭！
    商业部财务局刘仁俊来信：我坚决要求严办胡风及其集团中的骨干分子，清算他们的罪恶。从第三批材料中可以清楚看出，胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子很早以来就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，是潜藏在革命阵营里的特务；他们对蒋介石的反革命内战，充满了“乐观”，而对人民革命力量抱着“一不做，二不休”的仇视态度。对新社会，对人民民主政权，他们表现了刻骨的仇恨，诅咒人民革命政权“灭亡”“完蛋”。胡风分子和一切暗藏的敌人一样，采取了狠毒、阴险、奸诈、鬼祟卑鄙的流氓手段，进行反革命活动，阴谋破坏社会主义建设。胡风二十多年来的反革命罪恶，毒害了不少纯洁的青年，使革命事业受了不可弥补的损失。为了巩固人民民主专政，保卫社会主义胜利果实，我要求政府从严惩处反革命罪魁胡风，对其他分子也要根据情节轻重，分别地给予必要的处理。
    北京市南苑区供销社李蕴维来信：我看到“人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的材料，使我弄清了，原来胡风和胡风的反革命集团许多骨干分子，是罪证确凿的蒋介石的忠实走狗。他们同帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切的联系，他们长期打着马克思主义的招牌，以“文艺”做幌子，假装革命，暗藏在人民的内部，从事反党、反人民、反革命的活动。我们再也不能容忍了，为了保护我们劳动的果实，为了保卫祖国的安全，为了保证社会主义建设事业的顺利进行，我们绝不能叫反革命分子伺机再起，对胡风和胡风反革命集团分子要依法惩办！
    北京石油学院全体同学来信：我们是北京石油学院的学生。在看了报上揭发的有关胡风反革命集团的材料和听了有关的报告后，我们认清了胡风集团是一个反革命集团，是我国人民的敌人。
    我们热爱祖国，也热爱领导我们走向社会主义的中国共产党和毛主席。我们完全信任、并永远忠实于党和毛主席所规定的一切政策和路线，包括党的文艺路线。
    因此，我们就不能容忍胡风反革命集团对我们党的猖狂进攻和恶毒的污蔑，也不能容忍胡风反革命集团的一切反社会主义的纲领和活动。我们完全拥护“人民日报”这次对胡风集团的揭露，我们认为一定要把胡风这个反革命集团彻底粉碎，并建议政府对他们的反革命罪行进行严肃的处理。
    我们相信，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，胜利将永远是属于我们的。
    陕西省西安市文化局全体同志来信：“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”揭发了胡风集团的政治背景。原来他们很早以前就同帝国主义国民党特务机关有着密切的联系。解放以后，他们伪装革命，潜藏在人民内部，干着反革命的勾当。他们寻找和利用思想上有错误的人，历史上有问题的人，丧失警惕性的人，加以拉拢，使这些人堕入他们的圈套。他们打入共产党内，骗得党员称号，以便窃取党内文件，探听党内情况，里应外合地从事各种反革命活动。他们疯狂地、刻骨地仇恨人民民主专政和新社会的一切。他们的这种阴险手法，的确比公开的敌人更可怕。我们要求政府严厉地依法惩处胡风和胡风集团中的死不悔悟的反革命分子，我们并要很好记取胡风事件给我们的教训，努力学习马克思、列宁主义，百倍地提高革命的警惕性，要学会善于辨别伪装的反革命分子和他们的阴谋罪恶活动，及时地把一切隐蔽的敌人揭露出来和镇压下去。让我们紧紧地团结在中国共产党的周围，坚决地把革命进行到底，保卫和建设我们伟大的祖国！陕西榆林专区农场窦志达来信：我虽然是在偏僻农村中从事农业工作的人，但和全国各地的人们一样，我也经常注视着我们可爱的祖国所发生的一切变化。当我知道了胡风反革命集团的罪恶后，感到有说不出的愤恨。胡风集团是我们的阴险的敌人。他们竟敢对我们爱戴的伟大中国共产党加以诬蔑，竟敢采用“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”钻到革命组织内，从事破坏工作。他们是多么恶毒啊！我建议依法惩处他们。
