Jilin Expands Area of High-Yield Crops

    Spring plowing and sowing work in Jilin Province has basically concluded. Currently, farmers are universally engaged in inspecting seedlings, replanting, and weeding.

    Jilin Province plans to produce six million tons of grain this year, an increase of 490,000 tons compared to 1954, with an average yield increase of 206 jin per hectare compared to 1954. In order to accomplish this year's production increase task, farmers in various regions have appropriately expanded the planting area of high-yield crops during spring plowing and sowing. In Baicheng Prefecture alone, the planting area of high-yield crops accounts for more than 86% of the total cultivated land area, an increase of 13% compared to 1954. In particular, the high-yield corn area has increased by 28% compared to 1954. The planting area of rice has also greatly increased this year. According to preliminary statistics from 23 counties including Yongji and Panshi, the newly expanded paddy field area reaches more than 3,000 hectares. The planned expansion of paddy fields in various state-owned irrigation areas has also overfulfilled the plan. At the same time, the province has also expanded the mixed-crop area by 200,000 to 300,000 hectares this year. Farmers in various regions have also selected and replanted and restored a large number of fallow land.

    吉林扩大高产量作物面积
    吉林省春耕播种工作已基本结束。目前农民正在普遍进行查苗、补苗和铲?工作。
      吉林省今年计划生产六百万吨粮食，比一九五四年增产四十九万吨，平均每垧地比一九五四年要增加产量二百零六斤。为了完成今年增产任务，各地农民在春耕播种中，都适当地扩大了高产作物的播种面积。仅白城专区高产作物的播种面积，就占总耕地面积的百分之八十六以上，比一九五四年增加了百分之十三。特别是高产量的玉米比一九五四年增加了百分之二十八。水稻的播种面积，今年也有很大的增加。据永吉、磐石等二十三个县的初步统计，新扩大的水田面积达三千多垧。各地国营灌区计划增开的水田，也都超额完成了计划。同时今年全省还扩大了混种作物面积二十万垧到三十万垧。各地农民今年还拣种和恢复了大批熟荒地。
