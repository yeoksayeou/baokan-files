Lessons from Blindly Pursuing Large-Scale Land Consolidation in Agricultural Cooperatives
By our reporter Zhen Weimin

    In the process of developing agricultural production cooperatives, the Jiading County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province, due to blindly pursuing large-scale land consolidation for agricultural cooperatives and advocating land swaps between agricultural cooperatives and non-member farmers, made the serious mistake of infringing upon the property rights of farmers, especially middle peasants.

    In the autumn of 1952, when the Jiading County Committee was piloting the Yu'nong Agricultural Cooperative in Malu Township, it began using land swaps to consolidate land within the cooperative. At that time, the Jiading County Committee believed that the land of the Chen Yongyuan mutual aid group, which was preparing to transfer to the cooperative, was scattered and fragmented, which would not allow them to fully utilize labor efficiency and would make it difficult to use new farm implements in the future, so they should study how to adjust the land. Originally, it was not entirely impossible for agricultural cooperatives to make certain adjustments to the land with the complete willingness of the members and non-member farmers and on the principle of mutual benefit. However, if land swaps were regarded as a necessary step or condition for building a cooperative, errors would inevitably occur. However, the Jiading County Committee only saw the benefits of land swaps at that time and did not consider what consequences land swaps would have. Therefore, when the head of the county committee work group, Chi Zhaoli (currently a member of the county committee and secretary of the Nanxiang District Committee), went to the Chen Yongyuan mutual aid group to mobilize them to establish a cooperative, he told the mutual aid group members: "You have the priority to swap land if you establish a cooperative first." It seemed that land swapping was a right of establishing a cooperative. Therefore, the leading staff of the township regarded land swapping as a major task.

    At the expanded meeting of the township staff, they called on everyone to mobilize the farmers who did not join the cooperative to swap land with the Chen Yongyuan mutual aid group to "support" the Chen Yongyuan mutual aid group in establishing a cooperative. After the meeting, they specifically convened a meeting of "land-swapping households." During the meeting, under the control of Yao Guanlin, the resident staff member of the cooperative, the leading cadres of the cooperative conducted education on "current interests and long-term interests" for everyone, and through the typical speech of Shen Jinshan, a non-member farmer who voluntarily swapped land, they "motivated" most of the hesitant and unwilling farmers to swap land. Their practices were summarized by the County Committee's Agricultural Committee into two documents, the "Yu'nong Cooperative Establishment Work Report" and the "Preliminary Summary of Yu'nong Cooperative's One-Year Pilot Program," and distributed to various districts. The former document introduced their practices, and the latter document affirmed the benefits of land swaps. Later, when various districts were piloting cooperatives, they all regarded land swapping as a necessary work step.

    When the Yu'nong Cooperative expanded, Li Yuanchen, then a member of the county committee and director of the Farmers' Association, personally helped it formulate a land-swapping plan—a plan for making the cooperative's land contiguous. Zhang Renqia, a middle peasant, had two and a half mu of land that was included in the plan, and he refused to swap it with the cooperative, but the cooperative plowed his land anyway. Before the autumn of 1954, when the county was preparing to develop a large number of new cooperatives, someone in the training class for cooperative establishment cadres held by the county committee reflected the problem of coercion and commandism in land swaps, but it failed to attract the attention of the county committee. The former county committee secretary, Pan Linru, and the current county committee secretary, Mou Jiaogao, both said that as long as the masses were willing and mutually benefited, the land could be adjusted. But there was no standard for so-called willingness and mutual benefit. The district and township staff heard the county committee say this, so they let go and did it from point to point.

    As a result, the problem developed to such a serious extent: among the 162 new cooperatives established in the county around the autumn harvest and autumn planting of 1954, 147 cooperatives swapped land. A total of 2,137 households were subjected to land swaps, involving 5,998 mu of land. Among them, 1,672 households were poor and middle peasants, involving 3,590 mu of land; 465 households were landlords and rich peasants, involving 2,408 mu of land. Yangcun Township in Xuhang District treated land swapping as a "movement." Qiu A'qiu, the secretary of the township party branch, openly threatened the masses: "Establishing cooperatives is building socialism. Whoever refuses to swap land is sabotaging socialism." If the non-member farmers couldn't understand, he would call them to the township government for "individual talks" to get their thinking straight. This township only established four cooperatives, but it swapped 333 mu of land. Shen Bogen, a middle peasant, had two and a half mu of land swapped to the agricultural cooperative, but the agricultural cooperative did not tell him where the land they swapped to him was located. It was not until the county sent people to investigate that it was found. Zhang Dezhu, a middle peasant, had five and a half mu of fertile land. Yangcun Third Cooperative said they would swap it with a piece of land that was equally good and that he had cultivated before. After he agreed, the agricultural cooperative gave him a piece of land that was full of weeds and not fertile. In some places, if non-member farmers did not agree to swap land, the district and township staff forced them to swap. Xu Yun, the former district committee member of Wai'gang District, told the staff of Xinmin Cooperative in Lianxi Township: "The cooperative's land must be zoned." This cooperative divided the land into five zones, and all the land belonging to the masses outside the cooperative within these five zones had to be swapped to the cooperative. If the non-member farmers did not agree, the core members of the cooperative asked Xu Yun for instructions. Xu Yun said: "If they really don't agree, let them cultivate it, and it will belong to the cooperative in the future. We will only repay the seeds, not even the labor costs." Yin Minggao, a poor peasant in Zhangjia Village, Huangqiang Township, Huangdu District, had a piece of land adjacent to the land of Guangming Fourth Cooperative in this village. Guangming Fourth Cooperative wanted to swap it with him, but he did not agree. Xu Wenxun, a core member of the cooperative, pulled the cattle and went to plow the land. Fan Jinzhang, Su Peiyuan, and Zhao Jinrong, three poor peasant households in Fanjiacai, Malu Township, Nanxiang District, were allocated two and four-tenths mu of land in Jinjiabang during the land reform. The Qingeng Agricultural Cooperative of Jing'an Township notified them that they wanted to swap it with them, but they did not tell them where the land they swapped to them was located, and they did not agree. When these households were harvesting rice, before they had finished cutting two rows, the agricultural cooperative sent more than 20 people to plow the land and sow wheat. These three households were very dissatisfied.

    The result of the land swaps greatly damaged the unity between the members and non-members of the cooperative and the enthusiasm of the non-member farmers for production, giving landlords and rich peasants an opportunity to carry out sabotage activities. Xiao Yingzhen and Xiao Peisheng, who had their land swapped by Xinmin Cooperative in Waigang District, cursed people at home every day and ignored the agricultural cooperative members they met on the street. Chen Zhuting's wife, a middle peasant, was afraid of land swaps, so she pulled out some of the garlic that had already been planted in the field. Zhao Shoulian, a poor peasant in Zhutang Village, Malu Township, was unwilling to plant in the autumn after the agricultural cooperative swapped three mu of land with him. After being mobilized by the staff, although he sowed the seeds haphazardly, he was unwilling to fertilize, and the crops turned yellow. Two mutual aid groups in the second village of Fanglou Township applied less fertilizer to their rice fields last year because they were afraid of land swaps, resulting in a loss of more than 100 jin per mu. Landlords and rich peasant elements took the opportunity to sabotage. In the land swaps, many rich peasants offered land in order to win over the staff and evade burdens. Forty-five rich peasant households in Nanxiang District offered 179.98 mu of land. There were also those who abandoned their land under the pretext that the land had been swapped far away. For example, after seven rich peasant households in Zhutang Village, Malu Township, swapped land, they abandoned a total of 20 mu. Some rich peasants were even more vicious in sowing discord. Zhu Xinlu, a rich peasant in Zhutang Village, provoked the masses who had their land swapped, saying: "Swap it to the left, swap it to the right, and the land will be gone!" When Zhu Jinhua, a farmer in Jianbang Township whose land had been swapped, was about to be buried, Song Xingen, a rich peasant, said to him: "The feng shui of your land is good, you can't buy it for several thousand yuan." Zhu Jinhua quarreled with the agricultural cooperative after hearing this. A rich peasant in Zhutang Village said to the farmers in his village: "I would be happy if our village established a cooperative and swapped our land, but now it is swapped to Jing'an Township, and I am really not convinced. Jing'an Township is bullying us." He sowed discord between the masses of the two villages.

    The erroneous practice of land swaps hindered the healthy development of the cooperativization movement. Many farmers joined the cooperative because they were afraid of land swaps. According to Wang Yanbin, the staff member of the County Committee stationed in Yu'nong Cooperative, 30 percent of the members of Yu'nong Cooperative joined the cooperative because they were afraid of land swaps. There were also a few people who wanted to swap their bad land for good land by joining the cooperative. The members who had already joined the cooperative but whose land had been swapped outside the cooperative were also uneasy. Seven middle peasant members of Linong Cooperative in Jianbang Township demanded that the land that had been swapped out be swapped back, and claimed that they would withdraw from the cooperative if it was not swapped back. Land swaps promoted the development of spontaneous cooperatives. In the spring and autumn seasons of last year, a total of 67 spontaneous cooperatives were discovered in the county. One of the main reasons for spontaneous cooperative establishment was the fear of land swaps or the desire to swap other people's good land.

    What are the reasons for the serious error of land swaps? Some people say that it was mainly the coercive and commanding style of the cooperative establishment staff below that ruined things. This is obviously a misplaced emphasis. From the entire process of the occurrence and development of the land swap incident, the root cause of the error lies mainly in the fact that the Jiading County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had serious subjective idealism and impetuous and rash advancement emotions, and wanted to establish agricultural cooperatives on the basis of entire pieces of land at once, regardless of whether the actual conditions made it possible. This was manifested in the fact that they proposed to adjust the land when they first piloted the Yu'nong Cooperative; then, they promoted the erroneous practice in Yu'nong Cooperative as an experience; and they did not correct the error of land swaps when it occurred universally.

    Currently, the Jiading County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, with the help of the higher-level party committee, has initially examined its mistakes and has begun to take measures to correct the mistakes.

    盲目追求农业合作社土地连片的教训
    本报记者　甄为民
    中共江苏省嘉定县委员会在发展农业生产合作社的工作中，由于盲目追求农业合作社的土地连片，提倡农业合作社和社外农民调换田地，产生了侵犯农民特别是中农的产权的严重偏向。
    一九五二年秋天，嘉定县委在马陆乡试办裕农农业合作社的时候，为了使社里的土地连片，就开始采用了调换田地的办法。当时，嘉定县委认为准备转社的陈永元互助组土地分散、零碎，不能充分发挥劳动效率，将来不好使用新式农具，应该研究如何调整土地。本来，农业合作社在社员和社外农民完全自愿和双方有利的原则下，对土地作某些调整，并不是完全不可以的。但如果把调换田地作为建社工作的一个必经步骤或必要条件，那就必然会发生错误。可是，嘉定县委当时只看到调田的好处，不去考虑调田究竟会发生什么样的后果。所以，当县委工作组长迟兆理（现任县委委员，南翔区委书记）到陈永元互助组去动员办社时，就对互助组组员说：“你们首先办社，有调好田的优先权。”好像调田是办社的一种权利。于是，乡的领导工作人员就把调田当作一件大事来做了。
    在乡的工作人员扩大会上，他们号召大家要发动不办社的农民和陈永元互助组调田，“支援”陈永元互助组办社。会后，又专门召开了“调田户”会议。会中，在驻社工作人员姚冠林的掌握下，由社的领导骨干对大家进行“目前利益和长远利益”的教育，并通过自愿调田的社外农民沈近山的典型发言，来“带动”大部分犹豫不决和不愿意调田的农民调田。他们的做法，被县委农委总结成“裕农合作社建社工作报告”和“裕农合作社试办一年的初步总结”两个文件，发到各区。前一个文件介绍了他们的做法，后一个文件肯定了调田的好处。以后，各区在试办社时，就都把调田当成了一个必经的工作步骤了。
    裕农合作社扩大社时，当时的县委委员、农会主任李元臣亲手帮助它拟定了调田的计划——社的土地成片的规划。中农张仁洽有二亩半田被划在规划内，他不肯跟社调换，社里也把他的田犁了。一九五四年秋前，这个县在准备大量发展新社的时候，在县委举办的建社干部训练班上，有人反映了调田中的强迫命令问题，但没有能够引起县委注意。前任县委书记潘林儒和现任县委书记牟教高都曾经说过：只要做到群众自愿互利，就可以调整土地。而所谓自愿互利却没有标准。区、乡工作人员听到县委这样说，就由点到面地放手做起来了。
    于是，问题就发展到这样严重的地步：在一九五四年秋收秋种前后，全县新建的一百六十二个社中，调田的就有一百四十七个社。被调田的对象共计二千一百三十七户，调田五千九百九十八亩。其中贫农、中农共一千六百七十二户，调田三千五百九十亩；地主、富农四百六十五户，调田二千四百零八亩。徐行区杨村乡曾把调田当做一个“运动”来搞。该乡党支部书记仇阿秋公开威胁群众说：
  “办社是建设社会主义，啥人不肯调田，就是破坏社会主义。”社外农民想不通，他就叫到乡政府“个别谈话”打通思想。这个乡只办了四个社，就调了三百三十三亩田。中农沈伯根有二亩半田给农业合作社调去，而农业合作社调给他的田在哪里也没有告诉他，直到后来县里派人去调查时才查到。中农张德祖有五亩半肥田，杨村第三社说要用一块同样好的又是他种过的田跟他调换，他同意后，农业合作社却给他一块草很多、又不肥壮的田。有些地方，社外农民不答应调田，区、乡工作人员就强迫他们调换。前外冈区区委委员许云在练西乡对办新民社的工作人员说：“社的土地要划片。”这个社把土地划了五片，在这五片内属于社外群众的田都要调到社里来。社外农民不同意，社内骨干请示许云，许云说：“实在不同意，就让他们种，将来归社，只偿还种子，连工价都不给。”黄渡区黄墙乡张家村贫农印明高有一块田和这个村光明四社的田靠在一起，光明四社要跟他调换，他不同意，社里骨干分子许文训拉了牛就去犁田。南翔区马陆乡樊家宅贫农樊锦章、苏培元、赵近荣三户，在土地改革中共分到了金家浜的两亩四分田，静安乡勤耕农业合作社通知要跟他们调换，也没有告诉调给他们的田在哪里，他们不答应。在这几户人家收稻时，还没有割满两行，农业合作社就派了二十多人来犁田播种小麦了。这三户人家都很不满意。
    调田的结果，大大损害了社内外农民的团结和社外农民的生产积极性，给地主、富农进行破坏活动以可乘之机。被外冈区新民社调了田的萧应珍、萧培生天天在家里骂人，对面碰到农业合作社社员也不理睬。中农陈竹庭的妻子怕调田，把田里已种好的大蒜拔掉一部分。马陆乡朱塘村贫农赵守廉被农业合作社调换了三亩田后，不愿秋种，经工作人员动员，虽然马马虎虎下了种，但不愿施肥，庄稼发黄。方楼乡第二村有两个互助组去年因怕调田，稻田少追一次肥，结果每亩少收一百多斤。地主富农分子趁机破坏。在调田中，富农为了拉拢工作人员和逃避负担，献田的很多。南翔区四十五户富农献田一百七十九点九八亩，也有借口田调远了而把田抛荒了的。如马陆乡朱塘村七户富农调田后，共抛荒二十亩。有些富农更毒辣地进行挑拨离间，朱塘村富农朱新禄挑拨被调田的群众说：“左一调右一调，田就没了！”戬浜乡被调田的农民朱锦华要落葬，富农宋新根对他说：“你那块地风水好，出几千元也买不到。”朱锦华听了就同农业合作社大吵一顿。朱塘村富农对本村农民说：“要是我们村上办社调我们的田我也高兴，现在被静安乡调去，真不服气，静安乡欺我们。”挑拨两村群众闹不团结。
    调田的错误作法，妨碍了合作化运动的健康发展。很多农民入社是因为怕调田。据县委会驻裕农社的工作人员王岩宾说，裕农社百分之三十的社员是因为怕调田而入社的。也有少数人是想把自己的坏田调好田而入社的。已入社但土地被调到社外的社员也惶惶不安。戬浜乡利农社七户中农社员，要求把调出去的土地调回来，并声称如果不调回来就要退社。调田促使了自发社的发展。去年春、秋二季，全县共发现六十七个自发社，自发办社的主要原因之一是怕调田或想调别人的好田。
    产生了调田这种严重错误的原因在哪里呢？有人说，这主要是下面办社工作人员的强迫命令作风把事情办坏的。这显然是一种轻重倒置的说法。从调田事件的发生、发展的全部过程看来，错误的根源，主要在于中共嘉定县委有严重的主观主义思想和急躁冒进情绪，不顾实际条件是否可能，想一下子就把农业合作社建立在整块土地的基础上。这表现在一开始试办裕农社的时候，他们就提出要调整
  土地；接着，又把在裕农社的错误作法当成经验加以推广；调田的错误普遍发生了，他们也不纠正。
    目前，中共嘉定县委在上级党委的帮助下已初步检查了自己的错误，并开始采取了纠正错误的措施。
