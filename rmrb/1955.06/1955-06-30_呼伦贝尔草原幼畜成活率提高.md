    Increased Survival Rate of Young Livestock in Hulunbuir Grassland
    As of the end of May, four banners in the Hulunbuir League pastoral area of Inner Mongolia had produced more than 369,000 head of various livestock, including foals, calves, lambs, and camel foals (the original number of livestock in 1954 was more than 1,349,000 head).
    The Party and government organs at all levels in the Hulunbuir League fully mobilized the herdsmen of each banner before and after the lambing and calving season, and systematically moved the pregnant livestock to spring camps with abundant water and grass, sheltered from the wind and free from disease. The herdsmen promptly repaired more than 4,000 old livestock pens and added new sheds, and prepared the tools and equipment needed for lambing and calving. Furthermore, on the basis of being organized, the herdsmen rationally allocated labor and assisted each other in lambing and calving, so the survival rate of young livestock was significantly improved. In 1954, the Chen Barag Banner and the Solon Banner had the highest survival rates of young livestock, ranging from 70% to 80%. This year, the West New Barag Banner, which had the lowest survival rate, reached 96.6%, and the East New Barag Banner, which had the highest survival rate, reached 98.5%. (Sai Yin)

    呼伦贝尔草原幼畜成活率提高
    截至五月底，内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟牧业区四个旗已产下马驹、牛犊、羊羔、骆驼羔等各种牲畜三十六万九千多头（一九五四年原有牲畜一百三十四万九千多头）。
    呼伦贝尔盟各级党政机关，在接羔工作开始前后，充分动员各旗牧民，将怀胎母畜有计划地移入水草丰美，背风无疫的春营地。牧民们及时补修旧畜圈和增设新棚圈共四千多座，又准备了接羔所需的工具和器材。又加上牧民在组织起来的基础上，合理调配劳力，互助接羔，所以幼畜成活率显著提高。一九五四年幼畜成活率最高的陈巴尔虎旗、索伦旗是百分之七十到八十，今年幼畜成活率最低的西新巴旗达到百分之九十六点六，幼畜成活率最高的东新巴旗达到百分之九十八点五。　（赛音）
