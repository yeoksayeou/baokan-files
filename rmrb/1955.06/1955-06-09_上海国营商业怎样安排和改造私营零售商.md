How Shanghai's State-Owned Commerce Arranges and Transforms Private Retailers
    Hu Yehhe

    Since the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of major materials such as grain, oil, and cotton cloth, the Shanghai market has undergone fundamental changes: state-owned commerce has expanded its control over sources of goods and strengthened internal allocation, the flow of purchasing power from other regions has decreased accordingly, and the total market turnover has declined. Under these circumstances, private retail businesses in Shanghai have experienced difficulties due to weaknesses such as bloated and excessive organizations, huge expenses, shortage of funds, and poor management, coupled with the passive management and dishonest business practices of some capitalists, which have even affected the lives of employees. However, private retailers in Shanghai have a wide reach and many stores, and have direct contact with a broad range of consumers, accounting for more than 60 percent of the entire retail market in 1954. Therefore, as long as they are patriotic, law-abiding, honest in their operations, obey the leadership of the state-owned economy, and accept the state's socialist transformation, the state will still need to utilize their capital, manpower, and storefronts for a considerable period to meet the needs of residents, expand commodity circulation, and maintain social employment.

    In response to the above situation, Shanghai's state-owned commerce and relevant departments have taken effective measures since the second quarter of last year to implement the policy of arranging and transforming private retailers industry by industry.

    In order to maintain a certain turnover for private retailers, state-owned commerce first resolved the problems of product popularity and price differences that existed between public and private businesses, without affecting the interests of consumers. Starting in the third quarter of last year, Shanghai successively adjusted the retail prices of all 6,000+ commodities in cooperatives. From November of last year, state-owned commerce also made appropriate adjustments to the wholesale and retail margin for 50 categories of commodities that were indeed tight. While reasonably adjusting public and private retail prices, Shanghai's state-owned commerce also strengthened the rational distribution of goods according to the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement. Not only did it provide private businesses with a certain amount of goods, but it also appropriately increased the proportion of popular goods. During the Spring Festival this year, relevant state-owned companies, while strengthening control over the source of goods and market management, allocated 50% to 90% of eighteen major Spring Festival goods such as cellophane noodles, dried bamboo shoots, pork, ham, sweets and biscuits to more than 13,600 private retailers in twelve industries including Southern goods, tea, pastries and sweets, supplying them to residents at unified prices. This expanded the turnover of private retailers, fully utilized private retailers, and greatly facilitated the purchases of citizens. In the past, suburban residents had to travel long distances to state-owned stores and cooperatives in the city center to buy fast-selling goods, but now they can generally buy them at nearby private retail stores.

    However, due to the decrease in external purchasing power in Shanghai and the decline in total retail sales, private retailers faced another difficulty. State-owned and cooperative commerce had to relinquish a certain amount of turnover in order to accommodate most private industries. At the same time, in order to systematically distribute goods and conduct management and supervision of private retailers, state-owned commerce had to concentrate some manpower and resources to actively enrich and strengthen wholesale institutions. Therefore, in the face of the market downturn since the beginning of spring, Shanghai's state-owned and cooperative commerce, after repeated calculations by industry and region, planned to relinquish a portion of retail outlets, counters, and certain varieties under the principle of both stabilizing market prices and maintaining the operation of private retailers, and planned to relinquish some fixed sales targets, thereby expanding the distribution range of private retailers. Businesses with funding difficulties were provided with loans by banks or entrusted with consignment sales by state-owned companies.

    At the same time, state-owned and cooperative commerce strengthened and enriched state-owned wholesale sales work with some of the manpower and resources that were withdrawn. Since the first quarter of this year, Shanghai's state-owned commerce has added 57 wholesale institutions, fundamentally solving the problems of private merchants queuing for goods and many commodities not being able to be displayed, which had existed for a long time. With the increase in wholesale institutions, state-owned wholesale departments have also improved their sales methods, simplified wholesale procedures and systems, and facilitated private retailers to purchase goods. Since November of last year, Shanghai's state-owned commerce has lowered the minimum wholesale quantity for 422 categories of commodities. Major commodities such as general merchandise, Southern goods, porcelain, and timber have all changed from dividing wholesale and retail boundaries according to quantity in the past to dividing them according to target, and some have even abolished the minimum wholesale quantity. In the past, the wholesale of rubber shoes, wool yarn, timber, porcelain, hardware and other commodities was limited in the number of wholesale times per month due to institutional and manpower constraints, but now they are supplied at any time. Since the first quarter of this year, the wholesale departments of pharmaceutical, general merchandise, food, timber, cotton yarn and cloth companies have further adopted new wholesale promotion methods such as visiting sales, mobile supply, telephone purchases, and door-to-door sales with samples for retailers, thereby encouraging private merchants to be diligent in purchasing and selling, and to allocate more varieties with limited funds and manpower, so that they can better serve consumers.

    Through these measures, the main industries of Shanghai's private retailers have basically improved their operating conditions, and the entire market has become more active than before. According to seasonal patterns, the social pure commercial retail turnover in the first quarter should generally be lower than the fourth quarter of the previous year. For example, the first quarter of 1954 decreased by more than 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 1953, of which private merchants decreased by more than 20%. However, the social pure commercial retail sales in Shanghai in the first quarter of this year decreased by only slightly more than 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 1954, and the retail sales of private retailers even increased by about 10% compared with the fourth quarter of last year due to the arrangement of state-owned commerce. With the improvement of business conditions, the confidence and enthusiasm of private merchants have also been improved. Some capitalists who did not ask about business in the past now go to the store every day to actively participate in work, and some have also reduced unnecessary expenses and tried to replenish funds to improve the operating conditions of the enterprise.

    While taking arrangement measures for private retailers, Shanghai also strengthened their management, supervision, and socialist transformation. In order to strengthen the management and supervision of private retailers, Shanghai's state-owned commercial wholesale departments have implemented zoned supply for general commodities, and implemented supply based on certificates and cards for certain commodities. Some wholesale departments of cotton yarn and cloth, food, general merchandise, and coal construction companies have also established a liaison system for industries and households, regularly understanding the situation of the private stores under their management, publicizing policies, promoting commodities, and promoting their active operation, guiding them to improve their service attitude, and inspecting their business style. In the first quarter of this year, state-owned companies also selected full-time staff to participate in the work of trade associations, and established a regular contact system with store employee unions and private store employees to give play to their role in supervising, transforming enterprises and capitalists. This not only enables state-owned commerce to gradually grasp the operating conditions of private merchants, and allocate goods more realistically and in a planned manner according to the needs of residents and the promotion ability of private merchants, but also further restricts the capitalist pursuit of profit and blind operation through strengthening supervision and education. In the past, the phenomenon of "big fish eat small fish" in private retail commerce, as well as the possibility of blindly pursuing profits and arbitrarily changing the scope of operations, disrupting market stability, have been greatly reduced. At present, among the eighty-eight private retail industries in Shanghai, nearly half of the retail stores have established distribution, consignment, and wholesale relationships with state-owned companies for all or part of their commodities, and the proportion of various state capitalist commercial activities in total pure commercial retail sales has also increased from 20.23% in the fourth quarter of last year to 25.06% in the first quarter of this year. Due to the expansion of state capitalism, the management of the market has been strengthened, which has also prompted the prices of most commodities on the market to be consistent with state-owned prices, ensuring greater stability in market prices.

    However, as it stands, Shanghai's state-owned commerce has only basically maintained private retail commerce and has done some necessary and possible transformation work. In the early stage of arranging the market, some units once had the practice of unilaterally taking care of difficulties, ignoring the enthusiasm of normal operating households, and ignoring the management and transformation of private commerce. At the same time, due to the irrational distribution and excess of private retail stores in Shanghai, some industries still have some difficulties. Therefore, in the future, Shanghai's state-owned commerce will need to further strive for the cooperation of relevant departments under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, rely on store employees, and, on the basis of basically arranging private retailers, adjust the private retail commercial network in a planned and led manner, and further transform the enterprises and personnel of private commerce.

    上海国营商业怎样安排和改造私营零售商
    胡野鹤
    自国家对粮食、油料、棉布等主要物资实行统购统销以来，上海市场发生了根本变化：国营商业扩大掌握了货源和加强了内部调拨，外地的流动购买力相应减少，市场营业总额下降。在这种情况下，上海市私营零售商业由于存在机构臃肿过剩、开支庞大、资金短缺、经营管理不善等弱点，再加上部分资本家经营消极，经营作风不老实，经营发生了困难，有的甚至影响到职工的生活。但上海私营零售商面广店多，跟广大消费者有直接的联系，一九五四年在整个零售市场上所占比重仍在百分之六十以上。因此，只要他们爱国守法、老实经营、服从国营经济领导，接受国家社会主义改造，在今后一个相当长的期间内，国家仍需要利用他们的资金、人力和铺面，供应居民需要，扩大商品流转，维持社会就业。
    针对以上情况，从去年第二季度开始，上海国营商业和有关部门即采取了有效措施，贯彻对私营零售商逐行逐业安排和改造的方针。
    为了维持私营零售商一定的营业额，国营商业首先在不影响消费者利益的原则下，解决原来存在于公私商业之间的商品冷热和价格贵贱等问题。去年第三季度起，上海市陆续调整了合作社全部六千多种的商品零售价格。去年十一月份起，国营商业又对五十类商品确属偏紧的批零差率作了适当的调整。在合理调整公私零售价格的同时，上海国营商业并根据统筹兼顾、全面安排的原则，加强了货源的合理分配工作。不仅给予私营商业一定数量的货源，并适当增加了热货的搭配比重。在今年春节期间，有关国营公司又在加强货源掌握和对市场管理的条件下，将粉丝、笋干、猪肉、火腿、糖果饼干等十八种主要年货的百分之五十到九十以上的货源，批售给南货、茶食糖果等十二个行业、一万三千六百多户私营零售商贩，按统一价格供应居民需要。这样，便扩大了私营零售商的营业额，充分利用了私营零售商，大大便利了市民的购买。过去郊区居民需要远道向市中心区国营商店和合作社购买的热销商品，现在一般都能在就近的私营零售店买到。
    但是，由于上海的外来购买力减少，零售总额下降，造成了私营零售商的又一方面的困难，必须由国营和合作社商业撤让一定的营业额才能把大部分私营行业安排下来。同时，国营商业为了对私营零售商有组织地分配货源和进行管理监督，也必须集中一部分人力和物力，积极充实和加强批发机构。因此，在入春以来市场转淡的情况下，上海国营商业和合作社商业，经过分行业分地区的反复算帐，在既能稳定市场物价，又能维持私营零售商的经营的原则下，有计划地撤让了一部分零售点、柜台和某些品种，并有计划地让出了部分固定销售对象，从而扩大了私营零售商的经销范围。资金困难的由银行予以贷款或由国营公司委托代销。
    和这同时，国营和合作社商业把撤掉的一部分人力和物力，加强和充实了国营的批发销售工作。今年第一季度以来，上海国营商业即增设了批发机构五十七处，使长期以来私商进货排队、许多商品不能陈列等问题，得到基本解决。随着批发机构的增加，国营批发部门也相应改进了销售方法，简化了批发手续和制度，便利私营零售商进货。去年十一月份以来，上海国营商业调低批发起点的商品就有四二二类，百货、南货、瓷器、木材等主要商品都从过去按数量划分改为按对象划分批零界线，有的并取消了批发起点。过去，胶鞋、绒线、木材、瓷器、五金等商品的批发，因受机构和人力限制，每月都限定批发次数，现在已做到随时供应。今年第一季度以来，医药、百货、食品、木材和花纱布等公司的批发部门，更进一步对零售商采取了访问推销、流动供应、电话购货和带货样上门销售等新的批发推销办法，从而鼓励了私商勤进勤销，以有限的资金和人手，配备更多的花色品种，使他们更好地为消费者服务。
    通过这些措施，上海私营零售商的主要行业经营情况已基本好转，整个市场也因而较前活跃。根据季节淡旺规律，第一季度的社会纯商业零售营业额一般地应低于上年度的第四季度，如一九五四年第一季度即比一九五三年第四季度下降一成半以上，其中私商下降了二成多。但今年第一季度的上海社会纯商业零售额比一九五四年第四季度只下降了百分之一强，而私营零售额更由于国营商业的安排，比去年第四季度还上升一成左右。私商因营业情况好转，经营信心和积极性也就有了提高，有些资本家过去不问业务的，现在每天到商店主动参加工作，有的还减低不必要的费用开支，设法充实资金，使企业的经营情况得到好转。
    上海对私营零售商采取安排措施的同时，并加强了对它们的管理、监督和社会主义改造。为了加强对私营零售商的管理和监督，上海国营商业批发部门的一般商品已实行划区供应，对若干商品实行了凭证和凭卡供应。花纱布、食品、百货和煤建等公司的部分批发部门并建立了分业分户的联络员制度，经常了解所管私营商店的情况，宣传政策，推销商品，并推动其积极经营，指导其改善服务态度，检查其经营作风。今年第一季度，国营公司还选派专职工作人员参加了同业公会工作，并通过店员工会和私营商店店员建立经常联系制度，发挥他们监督、改造企业和资本家的作用。这样，不仅使国营商业能逐步掌握私商的经营情况，根据居民需要和私商推销能力，更切合实际地、有计划地分配货源，而且通过加强监督和教育，进一步限制了资本主义的唯利是图和盲目经营的思想行为。过去，私营零售商业的“以大吃小”的现象，以及盲目追逐利润，任意变动经营范围，扰乱市场稳定的可能性，已大大减少了。目前，上海八十八个私营零售行业中，已有近半数的零售商店同国营公司建立了全部或部分商品的经销、代销和批售的关系，各种国家资本主义商业在纯商业零售总额中所占比重，也已由去年第四季度百分之二十点二三上升至今年第一季的百分之二十五点零六。由于国家资本主义的扩大，加强了对市场的管理，也就促使目前市场上绝大部分商品价格同国营牌价取得一致，保证了市场物价的更加稳定。
    但是，就目前来说，上海国营商业还仅仅是把私营零售商业基本上维持了下来，并作了一些必要和可能的改造工作。安排市场的初期，部分单位曾一度存在着片面照顾困难的做法，忽视了利用正常经营户的积极性，忽视了对私营商业的管理和改造。同时，由于上海私营零售店分布不合理和过剩，目前部分行业还有若干困难。因此今后上海市国营商业还需要在党委的统一领导下，根据建设社会主义新上海的方针，进一步争取有关部门的配合，依靠店员职工，在私营零售商基本上安排下来的基础上，有计划有领导地调整私营零售商业网，进一步对私营商业的企业和人员进行改造。
