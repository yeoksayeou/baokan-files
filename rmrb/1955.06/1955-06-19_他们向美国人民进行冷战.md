They are waging a Cold War against the American People
Zhou Meisheng

Just as the whole world feels that the international situation is tending towards relaxation and the conference of great powers is about to be held, the United States is in a state of deliberately created, impending doom.

According to news from the so-called "Emergency Period American News Center" by American news agencies, the United States held a three-day "national, largest-ever" atomic air defense exercise beginning on the 15th. "Before the hypothetical enemy aircraft's hydrogen bomb bombing," the President of the United States, senior government officials, and 15,000 civil servants fled to thirty-one "emergency evacuation sites" within three hundred miles of Washington, "hiding in basements." It is said that "fifty-three cities were hit by hypothetical nuclear bombs," and the United States "staggered from the severe damage of nuclear war." During the exercise, a series of "hypothetical orders" were also issued, from the proclamation of "civil defense emergency" for the "expected attack on the United States" to orders for "martial law" and "restoring the country to a state of preparedness." All of this created a terrifying atmosphere that the end of the world had come to the United States.

This may be ridiculous. However, this farce of self-disturbance by the American aggressor group seems to have not only its ridiculous side but also a side worthy of people's vigilance.

To put it bluntly, the American warmongers chose the eve of the summit of the great powers to stage such a play to incite war frenzy in order to wage a cold war against the American people, to make them disbelieve that the great power conference would have an effect, and to make them think that the United States should continue to expand its armaments and prepare for war.

In order to wage this cold war against the American people, they have put in a lot of effort, arranging everything step by step very carefully. On June 6, Dulles sounded the alarm, not allowing the American people to have hope for the great power conference. On June 10, "U.S. News & World Report" shouted that the Soviet Union was preparing to launch a "sudden attack." Starting on June 15, the American people were massively driven out to run "atomic" alerts. In short, according to their intentions, the American people should believe that the great power conference is fake, and preparing for war is the real thing.

From here, people see how those who are keen on war in the United States are deliberately trying to undermine the upcoming great power conference.

However, waging a cold war against the people is one thing, and how the people deal with the cold war is another. On the first day of the American exercise running the "atomic" alert, New York police arrested thirty people because they "sat on park benches, waving signs with anti-war slogans, demanding an end to the war (should be read as an end to the Cold War), believing this to be the only way to defend against atomic weapons." A woman in New York refused to hide when the air raid siren sounded. She said contemptuously, "I won't hide, just blow me up." Even some American civil defense directors responsible for carrying out this exercise refused to participate in it.

According to the American Gallup poll, seventy-four percent of the American people want the United States to negotiate with the Soviet Union. Peace-loving people all over the world are eagerly awaiting the great power conference. People see from all the Soviet Union's performances that the Soviet Union wants to make the conference a success. They see from all the United States' performances that the United States is waging a cold war in order to hate this conference. Obviously, the responsibility for whether the conference can be successful lies with the United States.

    他们向美国人民进行冷战
    周梅生
    正当全世界都感到国际形势在趋向缓和、大国会议快要召开的时候，美国却处在一种故意制造出来的大祸临头的紧张状态之中。
    据美国通讯社从所谓“紧急时期美国新闻中心”发出的消息说，从十五日开始，美国举行了一次为期三天的“全国性的有史以来规模最大的”原子防空演习。“在假想的敌机氢弹轰炸以前”，美国总统、政府高级官员和一万五千名公务员都逃到华盛顿周围三百英里内的三十一个“紧急时期疏散地”，“躲进了地下室”。据说，“有五十三个城市被假想的核子炸弹命中了”，美国因“受到核子战争的严重破坏而摇摇晃晃”。在演习的过程中，还发布了一连串的“假想命令”，从“预计将对美国发动进攻”的“宣布民防紧急状态”的布告，一直到“戒严法”和“使国家恢复备战状态”的命令。这一切造成了世界末日已经到临美国的恐怖气氛。
    这也许是可笑的。然而美国侵略集团这次似乎是庸人自扰的滑稽戏却不仅有着它可笑的一面，同时也有着值得人们警惕的一面。
    拆穿了说，美国好战者们选择大国首脑会议将要举行的前夕，来演出这样一出煽动战争狂热的戏，是为了向美国人民进行冷战，使他们不相信大国会议会有作用，使他们以为美国应该继续扩军备战。
    为了对美国人民搞这场冷战，他们是很花了一番工夫的，一步一步布置得很周密。六月六日，杜勒斯大敲警钟，不许美国人民对大国会议抱希望。六月十日，“美国新闻与世界报道”叫喊说，苏联准备发动“突然攻击”。从六月十五日开始，美国人民就被大规模地赶出去跑“原子”警报。总而言之，照他们的意思，美国人民应该相信，大国会议是假的，准备打仗才是真的。
    从这里，人们看到美国那些热心战争的人们是怎样处心积虑想破坏即将召开的大国会议。
    然而，向人民发动冷战是一回事，人民怎样对付冷战却又是一回事。就在美国演习跑“原子”警报的第一天，纽约警察就逮捕了三十个人，因为他们“坐在公园的凳子上，挥舞着写有非战口号的标语牌，要求结束战争（应读为结束冷战），认为这是防御原子武器的唯一办法。”纽约的一个妇女拒绝在发出空袭警报的时候躲开。她轻蔑地说：“我不躲，把我炸死好了。”甚至连负责执行这次演习的有些美国民防局局长都拒绝参加这次演习。
    根据美国盖洛普民意测验，百分之七十四的美国人民愿意美国同苏联进行谈判。全世界爱好和平人民热烈期待着大国会议。人们从苏联的一切表现中看到苏联要把会议开好。他们从美国的一切表现中看到美国为了仇视这个会议而进行着冷战。显然，会议能否开好的责任是在美国身上。
