An Educationally Significant Party Group Meeting
Qiao Yunzhu

Not long after the enthusiastic spring plowing began at the "Shuguang" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, the production enthusiasm of most female members declined. What was the reason? It turned out that the vice-chairman, Yu Yongxiang, was lowering the work points of the female members for no reason. On March 12th, the Party group of the cooperative held a group meeting to criticize Yu Yongxiang's erroneous practice and his erroneous thinking.

Peng Xianglian was the first to speak, saying: "According to the regulations of the cooperative's management committee, irrigating one mu of rapeseed counts as seven work points. The female members who could carry buckets actively participated in the labor. Generally, women could earn eight or nine work points a day, and some individual women could even earn twelve work points a day. But when our vice-chairman Yu Yongxiang heard that the female members could earn so many work points, he shouted: 'This is terrible! One male laborer of ours only gets one or two work points for digging pond mud for a day, and women get eight or nine work points for watering fertilizer. I say, at most give them six or seven work points a day, quickly change this standard.' You changed it just like that. You are a Communist Party member, why didn't you bring such an important issue to the Party group meeting for discussion, or consult with the members of the management committee, but made a personal decision? As a result, the female members are naturally unhappy to produce, and what a great impact this has on the current spring plowing!"

Group leader Peng Lifu agreed with Peng Xianglian's opinion and also criticized Yu Yongxiang: "What you did is indeed wrong. Why did you lower the work points of the female members? You should talk about your own thinking."

Although Yu Yongxiang felt that what he had done was wrong, he did not humbly accept criticism, but instead said unhappily: "I can't do this job. You don't say anything about the achievements in the cooperative, but you take out the shortcomings for criticism."

Seeing that he was so unhumble, Peng Lifu sternly criticized him: "You shouldn't talk like that. We are Communist Party members, we can't only look at the achievements and not the shortcomings, only like to hear praise and not like to hear criticism. Making achievements is our responsibility, and if there are shortcomings, we must admit and correct them. You have to think about the impact of your personal decision to arbitrarily lower the work points of the female members on spring plowing, and also think about whether what you have done is in line with the principle of 'to each according to his work' that we often emphasize."

Jiang Zhongshun also made a self-criticism in connection with himself, saying: "Last year, the cooperative did not reasonably evaluate work points for women, so only a few female members participated in labor during the autumn harvest. At that time, I felt it was unreasonable, but because there were no women working in my family, I didn't say anything. This is selfishness and also liberalism."

At this time, Yu Yongxiang made a little self-criticism, but it was not profound. Finally, he said again: "What I did is naturally wrong, but this is also for the good of the cooperative."

Peng Xianglian then criticized Yu Yongxiang's self-criticism: "It's not like that, if it's really for the good of the cooperative, how can it be wrong! What you did is only good for the male members, but not good for the female members. Think for yourself, is this view biased towards men and women, or is it equality between men and women?"

Liu Bigui, after hearing this, immediately made a self-criticism in connection with himself, saying: "I have a chauvinistic ideology, always thinking that women do not have a great role in production. Therefore, during spring plowing, I only paid attention to mobilizing the male members, and did not pay attention to mobilizing the female members. In fact, women have a great role in production. Every year during the autumn harvest, men always cut rice, and women thresh rice. If all of it is left to the men, I don't think it can be done well."

Liu Bigui's speech also enlightened Peng Lifu, and he said: "I also have a bit of this kind of thinking. Every time after evaluating work points, my wife always grumbles, complaining that the work points are too low. I always say to her, it's about the same for you women to get these work points, what are you still grumbling about? I think Yu Yongxiang's arbitrary lowering of the work points of the female members is a manifestation of chauvinistic ideology. Comrade Yu Yongxiang should recognize his mistake and stop saying that it is for the good of the cooperative. It is very obvious that the production enthusiasm of most female members has been affected, so what are you talking about being for the good of the cooperative?"

After everyone's criticism and help, Yu Yongxiang finally realized his mistake, and he said: "I accept everyone's criticism, and it has also helped me to improve my understanding. I know that this is the chauvinistic ideology at work! I guarantee that I will overcome this erroneous thinking in the future."

After the meeting, the cooperative's management committee decided that the work point standard for female members would remain unchanged, and the lowered work points would be compensated. In this way, the production enthusiasm of the female members immediately increased. After a period of time, the cooperative ranked the production activists, and found that out of the thirty-eight production activists, female members accounted for twenty.

    一次富有教育意义的党的小组会
    乔云铸
    江苏省江宁县曙光农业生产合作社热烈的春耕生产开始不久，多数女社员的生产情绪就消沉下来了。什么原因呢？原来是副社长余永祥无缘无故压低了女社员的工分。三月十二日社的党小组召开了一次小组会，对余永祥这种错误的作法以及他的错误思想作了批判。
    彭湘莲第一个发言说：“按照社务委员会规定，浇一亩油菜算七分工，女社员能挑担子的都积极地参加了劳动，一般妇女一天也能得八、九分工，个别妇女一天还能赚到十二分工。可是咱们的副社长余永祥一听到女社员能赚这么多的工分就嚷起来：‘这还得了，我们一个男劳动力挖一天塘泥也只有个把工，妇女浇浇粪就得到八、九分工，我说一天顶多给她们六、七分工，赶快把这个标准改
  一改。’你说改就改了，你是一个共产党员，这样重要的问题为什么不拿到党小组会上讨论，也不同社务委员们商量，就个人决定了呢？这样一来，女社员自然不高兴生产了，这对当前春耕影响多大啊！”
    小组长彭立福同意彭湘莲的意见，也对余永祥批评道：“你这样作的确不对，为什么要压低女社员的工分呢？你要把自己的思想谈谈。”
    余永祥虽然觉得自己的作法错了，但并不虚心接受批评，反而不高兴地说：“我这个工作算干不了，社里的成绩你们不作声，缺点就拿出来批评。”
    彭立福见他这样不虚心，就严肃地批评道：
  “你不应该这样讲，我们是共产党员，不能只看成绩，不看缺点，只爱听表扬，不爱听批评。作出成绩，是我们的责任，有了缺点，就要承认和改正。你要想想你个人作主随便压低女社员工分对春耕的影响，也要想想你这样作符合不符合咱们经常强调的‘按劳取酬’的原则。”
    江忠顺也联系自己检讨说：“去年社里就没有给妇女合理地评工分，因此一个秋季只有几个女社员参加劳动，当时我感到不合理，但因自己家里没有妇女劳动，也就没有作声。这是自私自利，也是自由主义。”
    这时，余永祥才作了一点检讨，但很不深刻，最后他又说：“我这样作自然不对，不过这也是为社里好。”
    彭湘莲紧接着又对余永祥的检讨批评道：“话不是这样说，如果真是对社里好，又怎能不对呢！你这样作只是对男社员好，对女社员可不好了。你自己想想，这种看法是重男轻女？还是男女平等？”
    刘必贵听了，马上联系自己检讨道：“我是有重男轻女思想的，总认为妇女在生产上作用不大。因此，春耕时，只注意发动男社员，就没注意发动女社员。实际上妇女对生产有很大作用。每年秋收总是男的割稻，女的轧稻，要是全让男的干，我看就干不好。”
    刘必贵的发言也启发了彭立福，他说：“这种思想我也有点，每次评工分之后，我老婆总是叽咕，嫌工分少，我也老是对她说，你们妇女能得这些工分也就差不多了，还叽咕什么？我看余永祥随便压低女社员工分，正是重男轻女思想的表现。余永祥同志应该认识自己的错误，不要再说什么为了社里好，很明显，多数女社员的生产积极性都受了影响，还谈什么为社好呢？”
    余永祥经过大家的批评和帮助，最后认识了自己的错误，他说：“大家的批评，我都接受，也帮助我提高了认识，知道这是重男轻女的思想在作怪！我保证今后要克服这种错误思想。”
    会后，社务委员会决定女社员的工分标准不变，压低的工分再补起来。这样，女社员的生产情绪马上就提高了。过了一段时间，社里把生产积极分子排了一下队，发现三十八个生产积极分子中，女社员就占了二十人。
