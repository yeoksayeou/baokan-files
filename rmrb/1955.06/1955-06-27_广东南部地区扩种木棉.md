    Expansion of Kapok Planting in Southern Guangdong
    Southern coastal areas of Guangdong Province are systematically expanding the planting area of kapok. Since the beginning of summer, farmers on Hainan Island have newly planted more than 120,000 kapok trees. The Pearl River Delta, Leizhou Peninsula, and other coastal areas are also successively starting planting. By the end of May, the previously scattered kapok plantings in various places had begun to produce floss. Farmers in the sixth district of Danxian County, who have planted more kapok, have already sold more than 87,000 catties of kapok flower to the state.
    Kapok belongs to the perennial sea island cotton system of tree cotton. It is a very good textile raw material, the cotton is soft and韧, the floss is fine and smooth, and the fiber is about one inch longer than ordinary cotton, and can be spun into 40 to 60 count fine yarn. But in the past, farmers did not know the benefits of kapok and allowed it to reproduce wild, lacking artificial management. In April of this year, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture, the South China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and other relevant departments organized forces to conduct detailed investigations of the distribution areas and cultivation management techniques, and transferred a batch of kapok seeds from Yunnan Province for distribution and planting in various places.

    广东南部地区扩种木棉
    广东省南部沿海地区正有计划地扩大木棉种植面积，入夏以来，海南岛农民已新植木棉十二万多株，珠江三角洲、雷州半岛等滨海地区，也陆续开始种植。五月底，各地过去零星种植的木棉已开始吐絮，栽植木棉较多的儋县第六区的农民现已卖给国家木棉花八万七千多斤。
    木棉属多年生海岛棉系统的木本棉花，是一种很好的纺织原料，棉质柔韧、绒条细滑、纤维比通常的棉花长一寸左右，可纺织四十至六十支的细纱。但过去，农民不知道木棉的好处，任由它野生繁殖，缺乏人工管理。今年四月间，广东省农业厅、华南农业科学研究所等有关部门，组织力量详细调查分布地区和栽培管理技术，并从云南省调进一批木棉种子，分配各地种植。  （李少球）
