    Supply Medical Train on the Gobi Desert
    Yan Shugui
    On May 6th, a brand-new green train – a supply medical train – was parked at a construction site west of Wuwei in Gansu Province. Many people stood beside the train, including workers who had just put down their work and rushed over, and mothers holding children. They were eagerly waiting to go on board for check-ups and treatment. People kept coming out of the train door, some holding medicine packages and bottles, others massaging their arms where they had just received injections.

    This supply medical train was jointly organized by Wuwei Hospital and related units. The carriages behind the train carried daily necessities and food needed by the workers. The first carriage was a small "hospital," with a clean clinic, a pharmacy stocked with seventy or eighty kinds of commonly used medicines, and a ward with two beds. Two doctors and nurses were on board to provide treatment and nursing care.

    Along the nearly one hundred kilometers from Wuwei to Pingkou Gorge, most of the area is Gobi desert. Many railroad construction workers and their families live here. It was very inconvenient for them to travel more than ten miles to the health center for treatment when they were sick. In case of emergency, it was even more difficult to get timely treatment. In order to solve the difficulty of medical treatment for them, Wuwei Hospital and related units formed a supply medical train. The supply personnel delivered the goods needed by the workers to the construction site and to the doors of the workers' families; medical personnel went deep into the work sites and the residences of the workers' families to treat patients. The medical staff participating in this work had great enthusiasm. During the first round of mobile treatment, they treated more than 140 patients. During the second round of mobile treatment, they treated another 190 patients. They worked from early morning until after ten o'clock in the evening; patients were seen as soon as they arrived, and sometimes they ate meals during the breaks in the treatment work.

    The supply medical train brought great convenience to the workers. Some patients who could not go to the hospital for treatment received timely treatment and recovered their health.

    戈壁滩上的供给医疗列车
    燕树桂
    五月六日，在甘肃省武威以西的一个工地上，停着一列崭新的绿色列车——供给医疗列车。车旁站着许多人，有刚刚放下工作赶到这里的工人，有抱着孩子的母亲，他们正在热切地等待着到车上去检查和治病。车门口不断走出一些人，有的手里拿着药包和药瓶，有的在按摩刚打过针的臂膀。
    这个供给医疗列车，是由武威医院和有关单位联合组成的。列车后面的几个车厢，带着供给工人需要的日用百货和粮食，第一节车厢是一个小型的“医院”。里面有一个整洁的诊疗室，一个备有七八十种常用药品的药房和设有两张病床的病房。车上有两个大夫和护士进行治疗和护理工作。
    从武威到平口峡的近一百公里的沿线上，大部分是戈壁滩，这里住着许多修建铁路的职工和他们的家属。他们患了病需要到十多里路远的保健站去治病，非常不方便。遇到急症，更难得到及时的治疗。武威医院为了解决他们治病的困难，和有关单位组成了供给医疗列车，供给人员把职工所需要的物品送到工地上和职工家属门前；医务人员深入到工作现场和工人家属居住的地方，给患者治病。参加这个工作的医务工作人员，热情很高。在第一次巡回治疗中，他们治疗了一百四十多个病人。在第二次巡回治疗中，又治疗了一百九十个病人。他们从清早一直工作到晚上十点多钟；病人随到随看，有时吃饭都是利用治疗工作的空隙时间。
    供给医疗列车给职工带来很大方便，有些不能到医院就诊的患者，及时得到了治疗，恢复了健康。
