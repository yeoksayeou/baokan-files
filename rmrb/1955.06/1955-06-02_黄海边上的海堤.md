Along the coast of the Yellow Sea stands a long seawall. Whenever the salt workers of the state-owned Huaibei Salt Field talk about the seawall, it's like talking about a beloved family member. The salt workers praise the seawall for protecting their safety, allowing them to carry out production smoothly.

The salt workers will never forget a day in July 1939. That day, the tide came. It rushed over the ditches, flooded the salt flats, and invaded the homes of the salt workers. In that single tide, over three thousand people drowned in the entire salt field and nearby agricultural areas. The salt workers will never forget the disasters that the tides brought for so many years. The salt workers became anxious and fearful whenever the tide came or they heard the roar of the sea. In those days of suffering, lives were swallowed, and the salt flats collapsed into the sea year after year.

In 1948, the Huaibei Salt Field was liberated. The People's Government allocated tens of thousands of catties of grain and organized the people of the salt field to connect the small seawall remnants left by the Kuomintang reactionaries, increasing their width and height, and establishing "safety mounds." When the high tide came, the salt workers would go to the safety mounds to protect their lives.

In order to fundamentally solve the safety problem, the People's Government led the people of the salt field in building seawalls starting in 1950. Along the coast of the Yellow Sea, the more than sixty-li long Guantong Seawall was built. In 1953, the more than forty-li long Guanxi Seawall was also built. The seawall was built year after year.

During the construction of the seawall, the support of tens of thousands of peasant brothers was obtained. During the construction of the Guanxi Seawall, all of the 1.12 million cubic meters of earthwork was due to the heroic labor of the peasant brothers. At the beginning of the project, more than 8,900 peasant brothers put forward the slogan "We will not go home until the seawall is built!" More than 670 small teams launched a mud-digging competition. The Xintan Natural Harbor on the beach could accommodate 300-ton freighters. Filling such a large harbor and then building a seawall on it was an extremely arduous project. Just as the high tide was about to arrive, more than 2,000 laborers launched a "race against the tide to build the dike" competition. They dug up cart after cart of mud from more than 1,000 meters away, filling the harbor and compacting the silt. They worked day and night, finally filling the harbor.

Now, the Tainan Seawall is under construction. Since March of this year, more than 14,000 laborers from four counties and cities have gathered on the more than seventy-li long coastline and begun their arduous labor.

Seawall connects to seawall. A large seawall more than two hundred li long has been built along the Yellow Sea coast. Large and small sluice gates have also been built on the seawall. As long as the gate is opened, the white, surging tide will flow from the tidal channels to various salt production areas, supplying the needs of salt production.

The seawall, like an iron Great Wall, resists the impact of the beast-like tide, protecting the safety of more than 2,000 shares of salt fields in the Huaibei Salt Field, and protecting tens of thousands of employees and their families to work and live happily on the coast of the Yellow Sea.

Correction:
In the June 1st issue of this newspaper, page 2, in the article "Chinese Character Consolidation and Chinese Character Simplification," paragraph 14, line 17, the sentence "The situation is exactly like this." should be deleted.

    黄海边上的海堤
    沈敏  同俭
    黄海边上竖立着漫长的海堤。国营淮北盐场的盐工们每当谈起海堤，就像谈起亲人的故事一样。盐工们赞美海堤保卫了他们的安全，使他们顺利地进行生产。
    盐工们不会忘记一九三九年七月里的一天。那天，海潮来了。它冲过河沟，漫上盐滩，闯进了盐工们的住房。就只那一次海潮，全盐场和附近农区共淹死了三千多人。盐工们不会忘记，海潮，多少年来它带给了说不完的灾害。盐工们一逢到潮汛，听到海啸，就提心吊胆。在那些苦难的日子里，人命被吞吃着，盐滩也一年年向海里倒塌。
    一九四八年，淮北盐场解放了。人民政府拨出了上万斤的粮食，组织盐场人民把国民党反动派遗留下来的一个个小海堆子联接起来，加大了宽度，增添了高度，并且建立了“安全墩”。当大潮来时，盐工们就走上安全墩，保护自己的生命。
    为了从根本上解决安全问题，一九五○年起，人民政府就领导盐场人民修筑海堤。黄海边上，一座六十多里长的灌东海堤修筑好了。一九五三年，四十多里长的灌西海堤也修筑好了。海堤，一年复
  一年地修筑着。
    在海堤的修筑中，得到了上万农民兄弟的支援。修筑灌西海堤时，在一百一十二万土方工程中，全是农民兄弟的英勇劳动。工程一开始，八千九百多名农民兄弟提出了“不修好海堤不回家”的口号。六百七十多个小队开展了挖泥竞赛。海滩的新滩自然港能进三百吨的大轮船，要把这样的大港填平，再在上面修海堤，是一项极艰苦的工程。就在大潮将要到来的时候，二千多民工展开了“抢潮筑堤”的竞赛。他们从一千多公尺远的地方，挖来一车一车的泥，填平了海港，又填实了淤泥。他们日夜不分地工作，终于把大港填好。
    现在台南的海堤正在修建。今年三月起，来自四个县市的一万四千多民工，聚集在七十多里长的海边上开始辛勤地劳动着。
    海堤连着海堤。黄海边上二百多里长的大海堤修筑成了。海堤上同时也修筑了大大小小的水闸。只要把闸门一开，白滔滔的浪潮，就会从一条条输潮沟流到各个产盐的工区，供应产盐的需要。
    海堤，它像一条铁的长城，抵挡住像猛兽般的海潮的冲击，保护着淮北盐场二千多份盐田的安全，保护着全场几万职工和职工家属们，在黄海边上幸福地劳动着，生活着。更正：
    六月一日本报二版“汉字整理和汉字简化”文内第十四段第十七行“情形也正是这样。”一句应删去。
