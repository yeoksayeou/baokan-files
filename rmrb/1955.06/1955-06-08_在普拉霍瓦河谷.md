    In the Prahova Valley
    Romania Danuoshi Miluokeshi
    In early April, spring came to the oil center of Romania - the Prahova Valley. The slopes covered with cranes have been draped in green, and puddles of water reflect the sun's dazzling light.
    For many years, we have been walking around this valley, and each time we discover exciting new changes in its rapid development. New houses and even entire emerging towns have appeared on the flat hillsides. There are more and more of the latest machines in the factories, and many of them are proudly marked with the "Made in the People's Republic of Romania" label.
    In the past, like spider silk, the Prahova Valley, this oil center, had countless connections with foreign trusts and various industrial capital centers - New York, London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin. In offices across the ocean, profits from the Prahova Valley were entered into accounts together with profits from the oil fields of Pennsylvania or Iran.
    If you ask the old workers what it used to be like here, they will all answer: This was a colony in the heart of a so-called "free" country. In fact, the Prahova Valley used to be truly an imperialist colony. There were colonialists and "natives" here, and people's lives were treated like ants. The oil fields seemed to be large cemeteries filled with wooden crosses rising from the ground. The masters here were foreign bosses who earned billions and sucked the marrow out of the people.
    The vast majority of Romania's oil was in the hands of foreign monopoly capital, with Romanian capitalists owning only a negligible share.
    The poverty and suffering of Romanian oil workers grew along with the profits of the imperialist trusts, which is one of the reasons why the Prahova Valley became a place for the glorious struggle of the Romanian workers' movement. The workers organized themselves to resist poverty, oppression, and foreign rule. Before liberation, the Prahova Valley became one of the strongholds of the Romanian Communist Party's underground activities.
    Soviet troops brought freedom to these places. The liberated people finally became the masters of the earth's wealth. All the oil fields became the property of the people. The Soviet Union not only gave us the most precious gift - freedom; but they also gave us constant and selfless assistance in building a prosperous new life in the Prahova Valley, in drilling new oil wells, and in laying the foundation for our extremely important industry - the oil industry equipment manufacturing.
    Up to now, the people of Proșsti, the center of Prahova, still proudly remember that at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Romania's oil equipment manufacturing industry was also mentioned. Comrade Mikoyan pointed out in his speech that Romania is a unique example in the world, a small country with abundant oil resources and its own oil equipment manufacturing industry.
    Let us visit the famous "May 1st" factory in Proșsti. A wide boulevard leads directly from the city center to the factory, and a tall red building appears before our eyes. The morning sun shines through the glass skylights into the workshop. The factory's courtyard is like a flower garden, and powerful cranes and countless machines work near these blooming courtyards.
    A skilled worker, So Oprinoiu, told us that the factory had been bombed three times during the war, and today's large-scale "May 1st" factory was built by the people's government.
    Walking into the spacious workshop, we marveled at the complex machines from Moscow and Leningrad. A long row of lathes, marked with the "Red Proletarian" factory label, and other machines from the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant; outside the factory workshop, trucks produced by the Stalin Automobile Factory and the Molotov Automobile Factory are transporting heavy equipment, while the swinging cranes are from the Kirov Factory in Leningrad.
    Now let us take a brief tour of the design department of this factory. Here we met Engineer Marinescu, who is in charge of the electric furnace. He told us how the factory is producing an increasing number of various types of machines according to Soviet technical documents. These include the latest turntables, various new pumps, and many other machines.
    In the half-kilometer-long and fifteen-meter-high lathe workshop, we talked with the advanced lathe operator Nicolae Călinuu. His production index card is the strongest proof of his serious attitude towards his work: when we stopped to talk to him, it was not yet noon, and he had already produced the thirty-fifth part, although his daily quota was seventeen parts.
    He told us that the working methods of Soviet workers helped him improve productivity. He said: "We know the working methods of the famous Soviet workers Bekov and Kolesov. We try our best to apply all new working methods under the current conditions. We always feel the friendly support of Soviet advanced workers in our work."
    Although the factory has to constantly produce new varieties and constantly solve complex technical problems, it still completed 101.2% of the 1954 annual plan, and production costs were reduced by 5.5% compared to 1953.
    Then we came to the tall electric forging furnace workshop, which is presided over by National Prize winner, female engineer Soe Lujiani. The furnaces here are made in the Soviet Union, which once again clearly demonstrates the Soviet Union's assistance to Romania.
    The female engineer told us: "Technology is not everything, you must first master it." A production innovation team led by her recently modified the electric forging furnace to be suitable for using marsh gas. This reduced production costs and increased productivity. This team recently proposed another major innovation suggestion. Using cheap crude salt instead of refined salt can save 500,000 lei (Note: Romanian currency) a year and also improve productivity.
    "How did you come up with this innovative idea?"
    "We found valuable hints about this in Soviet technical books, so we used them."
    Soe Lujiani described in detail the many experiments she conducted before determining the current working method. This female engineer is highly respected in the factory. She won the National Prize in 1952, when she was a member of a production team. With the help of Soviet technical documents, she produced drill bits for the Romanian oil industry for the first time. This was not a simple matter, because without special hardening treatment, the drill bit could not drill into the formation 2,000 meters deep, let alone penetrate the rock layer. However, Soe Lujiani tempered the steel of the drill bit so that it could penetrate any underground rock formation.
    The work of the "May 1st" factory is proceeding rhythmically. Our country is approaching the final year of the Five-Year Plan. Every worker is eager to fulfill their guarantee to the Party. This guarantee is to continuously mechanize and completely modernize our country's oil industry and strive for an annual output of 11 million tons. They fully realize that the whole country is trustingly watching this flower of Romanian heavy industry, and everyone hopes that it will stand at the forefront of our country's socialist labor competition as a production flag bearer.
    The factory director told us: "80% of the workers here have participated in the competition. The goal of the competition is to improve productivity and reduce costs. Last year, due to production innovations and rationalization proposals, we saved 3.6 million lei, which played a role in reducing costs. Communist Party members are the advanced people in the competition; the workers' enthusiasm and skilled technology are the guarantee for the realization of the plan stipulated by the Party."
    In the mountains, the Prahova River splashes white foam and rushes down. The number of machines, drilling machines, and cranes produced here is increasing day by day. When the turntable starts to rotate and the drill bit quickly drills into the formation, our country's oil drilling workers will gratefully remember their brothers in the "May 1st" factory, and remember those who produced so much excellent equipment for them.

    在普拉霍瓦河谷
    罗马尼亚  达诺什·密克洛什
    四月初，春天来到了罗马尼亚的石油中心——普拉霍瓦河谷。起重机林立的山坡上已披上了绿色的衣装，一洼洼的水反射出太阳的眩目的光芒。
    好多年来，我们一直在这个河谷走来走去，每一次我们都从它的飞跃发展中发现令人兴奋的新变化。在平坦的山坡上出现了新房屋以至整座新兴的城镇。工厂里最新式的机器愈来愈多了，而且许多机器上面都钉着“罗马尼亚人民共和国制造”的令人自豪的标牌。
    从前，像蜘蛛丝一样，普拉霍瓦河谷这个石油中心跟外国托辣斯和各个工业资本中心——纽约、伦敦、巴黎、布鲁塞尔、柏林有着千丝万缕的联系。在大洋彼岸的办公室里，来自普拉霍瓦河谷的利润和来自宾夕凡尼亚或伊朗油田的利润，一并入账。
    假如你向年老的工人们请教一下过去这里是什么样子，他们都会回答说：这里是在一个所谓“自由”国度的心脏里的一片殖民地。事实上，普拉霍瓦河谷过去真可以说是帝国主义的殖民地。这里有殖民主义者和“土人”，这里人的生命被当作蝼蚁一样。油田似乎就是插满着从地底下冒出来的木十字架的大片坟场。这里的主人是外国的老板，他们在这里赚取亿万财富，吮尽人民的膏脂。
    罗马尼亚的石油，过去绝大部分都是掌握在外国独占资本的手里，罗马尼亚本国资本家只占有微不足道的份额。
    罗马尼亚石油工人的贫困和苦难随着帝国主义托辣斯的利润一起增长，这也是普拉霍瓦河谷成为罗马尼亚工人运动进行光荣斗争的场所的原因之一。工人们把自己组织起来，反抗贫困、压迫和外国统治。在解放以前，普拉霍瓦河谷成了罗马尼亚共产党地下活动的据点之一。
    苏联军队给这些地方带来了自由。解放了的人民终于成为大地的财富的主人。全部油田都归人民所有了。苏联不仅给我们带来了最宝贵的礼物——自由；而且他们还在建设普拉霍瓦河谷的繁荣的新生活，在开凿新油井，在奠定我国极其重要的工业——石油工业设备制造业的基础方面，给予我们经常的和无私的援助。
    到现在为止，普拉霍瓦的中心——普罗什蒂镇的人民一直还骄傲地记得，在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上，罗马尼亚的石油设备制造业也被提到了。米高扬同志曾在他的发言中指出，罗马尼亚在世界上是这样一个唯一无二的榜样，一个小国拥有丰饶的石油资源，又拥有自己的石油设备制造工业。
    让我们来参观一下普罗什蒂有名的“五一”工厂吧。一条宽阔的林荫道从市中心直通到工厂，眼前出现了一幢高大的红色建筑物。早晨的阳光穿过玻璃天窗射入车间。工厂的院子很像一座花圃，强力的起重机和数不清的机器就在这些鲜花怒放的庭院附近工作着。
    一个熟练工人索·奥普林诺依乌告诉我们说，在战争中，这家工厂曾被轰炸过三次，今天规模宏大的“五一”工厂是由人民政权修建起来的。
    走进宽敞的车间，我们对来自莫斯科和列宁格勒的复杂机器赞不绝口。一长排的车床，上面钉有“红色无产者”工厂的标牌，其他一些机器来自乌拉尔重型机器制造厂；工厂车间外面，斯大林汽车工厂和莫洛托夫汽车工厂出品的卡车正在运送着重型的设备，而摆动着的起重机则是列宁格勒的基洛夫工厂出的。
    现在让我们对这个厂的设计部作一次短促的参观。在这儿我们会见了马林涅斯古工程师，他主持着电气熔炉的工作。他告诉我们工厂是怎样根据苏联的技术文件生产着数量日多的各种类型的机器。其中包括最新式的转盘，各种新式抽水机和其它许多机器。
    在长达半公里、高十五公尺的车工车间里，我们跟先进的车工尼古拉·卡里努乌交谈。他的生产指数卡片是他严肃对待自己工作的最有力的明证：当我们停下来和他谈话的时候，还不到中午，他已经在生产第三十五个部件了，虽然他每日的定额是十七个部件。
    他告诉我们：苏联工人的工作方法帮助他提高了生产率。他说：“我们知道著名的苏联工人贝科夫和科列索夫的工作法。我们尽可能在目前的条件下运用一切新的工作法。我们在自己的工作中时刻都感到苏联先进工人对我们的朋友般的支持。”
    虽然工厂要不断地生产新的品种，不断解决复杂的技术问题，但是它仍然完成了一九五四年年度计划的百分之一百零一点二，生产成本比一九五三年降低了百分之五点五。
    接着我们来到了高大的电气锻炉车间，主持这个车间的是国家奖金获得者、女工程师索耶·吕珈妮，这里的锻炉是苏联制造的，这又一次清楚地说明了苏联对罗马尼亚的援助。
    女工程师对我们说：“技术不等于一切，首先你必须掌握它。”她所领导的一个生产革新小组不久前曾把电锻炉改装得适合使用沼煤气。这样一来就降低了生产成本，并提高了生产率。这个小组最近又提出了一个重大的革新建议。用廉价的原盐代替精制的盐，一年可以节约五十万列伊（注：罗马尼亚货币名称），而且还提高了生产率。
      “你们是怎样想出这个革新的办法的呢？”
    “我们在苏联的技术书籍中发现了有关这方面的宝贵提示，于是就利用上了。”
    索耶·吕珈妮详细地描述她在确定现在的工作方法以前的多次试验。这位女工程师在工厂里很受人尊重。她在一九五二年获得了国家奖金，当时她是一个生产小组的组员。在苏联的技术文件的协助下，她首次为罗马尼亚石油工业生产出钻头。这不是一个简单的问题，因为不经过特殊的硬化处理，钻头就不能钻入地层二千公尺，更不能穿过石层。而索耶·吕珈妮却把钻头的钢锻炼到可以穿过任何地下岩层。
    “五一”工厂的工作正在有节奏地进行着。我们的国家正临到了五年计划的最后一年。每个工人都急于要履行自己向党所作的保证。这个保证就是使我国的石油工业不断机械化和完全现代化，并争取每年的产量达到一千一百万吨。他们充分认识到，全国都在信任地注视着这个罗马尼亚重工业之花，大家都希望它作为生产的旗手，站到我国社会主义劳动竞赛的前列来。
    厂长告诉我们：“这里百分之八十的工人都参加了竞赛。竞赛的目标是提高生产率和降低成本。去年，由于生产上的革新和合理化建议，我们节约了三百六十万列伊，这对降低成本起了作用。共产党员是竞赛中的先进者；工人们的热忱和熟练技术，是实现党所规定的计划的保证。”
    在群山中，普拉霍瓦河迸射着白沫奔泻而下。这里生产的机器、钻探机、起重机的数目一天天增加。当回转盘开始转动，钻头迅速地钻入地层的时候，我国的石油钻探工人就会怀着感激的心情想起他们的“五一”工厂的弟兄们，想起那些为他们生产了这么多精良设备的人们。（附图片）
