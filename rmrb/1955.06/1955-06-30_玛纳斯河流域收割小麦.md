    Harvesting Wheat in the Manas River Basin
    The vast wheat fields in the Manas River Basin of Xinjiang Province, which looked like a green ocean just over ten days ago, have now taken on a new apricot-yellow appearance. Around the end of June, combine harvesters and horse-drawn harvesters will once again appear in the fields. The Production and Construction Corps, which cultivates more than 150,000 mu of winter wheat in this area, will have a relatively good harvest this year. Each farm has already established a summer harvest command, and the soldiers of each company are working hard to prepare for the wheat harvest. Members of the mechanized farming team have already inspected and repaired the harvesting machinery. Members of the summer harvest security team patrol around the wheat fields day and night, closely guarding the ripening wheat.

    玛纳斯河流域收割小麦
    新疆省玛纳斯河流域的大片麦田，十多天以前，还像绿色的海洋，现在已换上了杏黄色新装，六月底左右，联合收割机，马拉收割机又将出现在原野上了。生产建设部队在这一地区经营的十五万多亩冬麦，今年将获得较好的收成。每个农场已经成立了夏收指挥部，各连队的战士们正在紧张地进行麦收前的准备工作，机械耕作队的队员已经检修好了收割机具，保卫夏收小组的组员，白天黑夜在麦田四周巡逻，严密地保卫着成熟的小麦。
