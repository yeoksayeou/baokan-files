	Appropriately Developing Rural Sideline Occupations Is Beneficial and Harmless
	Li Yi

In the areas of Shengang Township and Heituo Township in the Sixteenth District of Fengrun County, Hebei Province, when developing agricultural producers' cooperatives last winter, some district and township staff blindly believed that individually running certain handicrafts, transportation businesses, or engaging in petty trading was "developing capitalism" or "capitalist sprouting." Therefore, they universally mobilized these people to join agricultural producers' cooperatives and participate in agricultural production; after joining the cooperatives, they were no longer allowed to engage in these sideline occupations. This practice seriously affected the rural economic life. According to a survey in Shengang Township, among the members of the agricultural producers' cooperatives in the township, there were about two hundred households who originally engaged in transportation by pushing wheelbarrows, driving rubber-wheeled carts, or were blacksmiths, carpenters, or petty traders. After these households joined the cooperatives, they all stopped running their original sideline occupations. Some of these households had relied on running these sideline occupations to maintain their family's livelihood, while others used them to supplement insufficient agricultural income. Since stopping these sideline occupations, these households have felt great financial difficulty. According to a survey of fifty-three households in Huozhuang and Wangzhuang agricultural producers' cooperatives in Shengang Township who originally engaged in some sideline occupations, their income decreased by about seven or eight thousand yuan after stopping these occupations. Under such circumstances, very unreasonable phenomena naturally arose—there was a lot of surplus labor in the agricultural producers' cooperatives. A member of Ximujiangzhuang in Shengang Township said: "After being organized, we have no work to do, working one shift and resting one shift." Many women in agricultural producers' cooperatives requested to participate in labor, but the core members of the cooperatives said: "The male laborers don't even have enough work, how can it be the women's turn?" Wangzhuang averages two mu of land per person. In the past, many households engaged in sideline occupations and did not delay the cultivation of the land; now everyone is restricted to the cooperatives, and they are not allowed to engage in sideline activities, so naturally it seems that there is energy but nowhere to use it.

Currently, in areas where such situations have occurred, the issue of members' sideline occupations should be addressed immediately. Blindly opposing the operation of sideline occupations is wrong. Rural workers in these areas must clearly recognize that these people pushing wheelbarrows, driving rubber-wheeled carts, blacksmiths, carpenters, and petty traders are not capitalists or exploiters, but working people. Their business activities are beneficial to themselves, to the whole cooperative, and to the whole township. The only question is how to make these members' sideline occupations more organized and planned, so that these business activities do not hinder agricultural production. For a portion of people who insist on not joining agricultural producers' cooperatives, they should be allowed to withdraw from the cooperatives or organize handicraft production cooperatives separately.

    适当地发展农村副业是有利无害的
    李翼
    河北省丰润县十六区深港乡、黑坨乡一带，去年冬季发展农业生产合作社时，某些区乡工作人员盲目地认为单独经营某些手工业、运输业或兼营小贩，就是“发展资本主义”，或说是“资本主义冒尖”。于是，就普遍地动员这些人加入农业生产合作社，参加农业生产；入社以后也不许他们再经营这些副业。这种做法，严重地影响了农村经济生活。据深港乡调查，这个乡各农业生产合作社的社员当中，原来推小车、赶胶轮车经营运输和铁匠、瓦木匠、做小本生意的约有二百多户。这些户入社后，一律停止了经营原来的副业。这些户，过去有的依靠经营这些副业维持一家人的生活，有的是用来贴补农业收入的不足。自从停止经营副业以后，这些户生活即大感困难。据深港乡霍庄和王庄农业生产合作社中原来经营一些副业的五十三户统计，停止经营以后大约减少收入七、八千元。在这样的情况下，也很自然地产生了非常不合理的现象——农业生产合作社里的劳动力剩余了很多。深港乡西木匠庄的社员说：“组织起来了，反倒没有活儿干，干一班，呆一班。”不少农业生产合作社的妇女要求参加劳动，社内骨干分子就说：男劳动力还没活干呢，怎能轮得到女的？”王庄平均每人二亩地，过去许多户经营副业，也误不了土地的耕作；现在大家都被限制到社里来，并且不许从事副业活动，自然就显得有力没处用了。
    目前，在发生这样情况的地区，应当立刻着手解决社员的副业经营问题，盲目地反对经营副业是不对的。这些地区的农村工作人员必须十分清楚地认识到，这些推小车的、赶胶轮车的、铁匠、瓦木匠、小商小贩，并不是什么资本家、剥削者，而是劳动人民。他们的经营活动，无论对他们自己或是对全社、全乡，都是有利的。问题只在于如何使这些社员的副业经营更加有组织有计划，使这些经营活动不妨碍农业生产。对于一部分坚持不愿参加农业生产合作社的人，应该允许他们退社或另行组织手工业生产合作社。
