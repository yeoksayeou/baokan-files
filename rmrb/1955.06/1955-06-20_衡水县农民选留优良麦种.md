    Hengshui County Farmers Select and Retain Superior Wheat Seeds
    Hengshui County, a famous dryland wheat-producing area in Hebei Province, has achieved a bumper harvest of 310,000 mu of superior wheat varieties such as "Fish Scale White" and "Da Bai Ling." In particular, the "Fish Scale White" superior wheat variety generally yielded more than 20% higher than other varieties. Some agricultural production cooperatives harvested more than 30% more "Fish Scale White" wheat than ordinary wheat. Currently, farmers are carrying out ear selection, plot selection, and field selection work, ensuring separate harvesting and storage to avoid seed mixing and to guarantee the completion of the 390,000 jin seed selection task for superior varieties.

    衡水县农民选留优良麦种
    河北省著名旱麦产区——衡水县三十一万亩鱼鳞白、大白苓等优良品种小麦，普遍获得丰收。特别是鱼鳞白优良小麦比其他品种一般均增产百分之二十以上，有的农业生产合作社的鱼鳞白小麦，比一般小麦多收了百分之三十以上。目前农民正在进行穗选片选和场选工作，做到单收单存，以免种籽混杂，保证完成三十九万斤优良品种选种任务。
