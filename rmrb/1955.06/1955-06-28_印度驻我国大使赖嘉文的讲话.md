Friends:

　　Many years ago, many centuries ago, some ethical concepts sufficient to guide human relations and eternal principles of human behavior originated in Asia and spread to other continents. Many of the world's great religions—Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Hebrewism, Christianity, Islam—originated in Asia and are Asia's contribution to the world. But in modern times, Asia has been silent, and Asia's brilliance has been overshadowed by young, martial, adventurous, and exploitative people from outside Asia. They spoke, and Asia could not but listen. For a time, the language of commerce and colonial expansionism replaced righteous conduct. The concept of "all under heaven are one family" taught by all the great Asian thinkers was only accepted in theory but cancelled in practice. This has created disputes in the world. Therefore, in a world constantly in a state of tension, if mankind wants to be free from dangerous coercion, it must reaffirm the famous principles of peaceful coexistence and mutual tolerance among nations.

　　It is very meaningful that when countries like India, China, Burma, and Indonesia awakened and regained their freedom, the important issues they were concerned with included freedom, equality, mutual respect, and non-interference—these are also the main contents of "peaceful coexistence." From the Asian Conference held in New Delhi in 1947 to the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in 1955, the awakened Asian countries have made many efforts to make "peace on earth" and "goodwill among men" in a new sense.

　　Last year, the joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of India and China in New Delhi can be said to be one of the most important such efforts. Although these two great politicians could of course only speak for the billion Asians they represented, the joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of Burma and China in Rangoon a few days later, which restated the striking provisions of the New Delhi statement, and the welcome expressed by the Asian people to these two joint statements later, undoubtedly showed that when Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai issued their joint statement on June 28, they were not only speaking for themselves and India and China, but also for many others. This is indeed the voice of the newly reborn Asian people calling for the world to be saved from disputes and contradictions through righteous conduct, a voice that resonated with people all over the world. The people of the world hope to hear a new voice, a new note in international relations, a new philosophy, a philosophy of peace, a code of human behavior in which tolerance, understanding, kindness, and good neighborliness occupy a major position.

　　What these Asian Prime Ministers said was the language of peace, hope, equality, and integrity. Indeed, the principles they advocated are nothing new, but the fact that they openly called on people to value these principles and recommended these principles to bring peace to this troubled world has new significance. These principles are not pious platitudes, but practical principles that, if followed, will change the face of the world.

　　Asian countries know from their own experience how necessary the five principles in the joint statement are. When the spokesmen of Asian countries gathered together for the first time, they naturally wanted to declare what they believed to be the right answer to save Asia and even the world from international disputes and confrontations.

　　The seeds were sown in June last year, and the sapling that grew up, although still a seedling, has already borne fruit. The principles listed in the joint statement have been gladly accepted by many countries as the basic principles of normal international relations. Whenever the leaders of peace-loving people meet, they reiterate the principles included in the New Delhi and Rangoon statements and express their approval. Not long ago, when the leaders of Asia and Africa held their first historical gathering in Bandung, they developed the five principles into ten principles; recently, in the joint statement of the Prime Minister of India and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, these principles were once again endorsed. I believe that as time goes by, more peace-loving people in the world will support and implement these principles.

　　May all countries that believe in and declare their support for these five principles continue to maintain close friendship with each other and with other countries, so as to prove the practical effectiveness and feasibility of these five principles. May their friendship and cooperation last forever, so as to consolidate the prosperity of the world and the happiness of mankind.

　　Long live good people!

　　Long live international friendship!

　　Long live peace!

### 印度驻我国大使赖嘉文的讲话

    印度驻我国大使赖嘉文的讲话朋友们：
    许多年以前，许多世纪以前，一些足以指导人类关系的伦理观念和人类行为的永恒原则，在亚洲产生了，并且传布到了其他各洲。世界上许多伟大的宗教——印度教、佛教、拜火教、希伯来教、基督教、回教——都起源在亚洲，都是亚洲对世界的贡献。但是在近代的年月里，亚洲却沉默了，亚洲的光辉被从亚洲以外来的年轻而尚武，冒险和剥削成性的人们遮盖了。他们发言，亚洲不能不听着。有
  一个时期，商业和殖民主义扩张主义的语言代替了正当的行为。一切亚洲伟大的思想家所教诲的“四海一家”的观念只是在理论上被接受，在实践中却被取消了。这就造成了世界上的争端。因此，在一个不断处于紧张局势的世界上，如果人类要想免受危险的胁迫，必须重申有名的各国和平相处、互相容忍的原则。
    非常有意义的是：当印度、中国、缅甸、印度尼西亚这些国家觉醒过来并重新获得了自由以后，他们关心的重要问题中就包括了关于自由、平等、互相尊重和互不干涉的问题—这些也就是“和平共处”的主要内容。从一九四七年在新德里举行的亚洲会议开始，直到一九五五年在万隆举行的亚非会议止，觉醒了的亚洲国家曾多次努力在新的意义上使“和平降临大地”、“人间充满善良”。
    去年，印度和中国的总理在新德里发表的联合声明可以说是一次最重要的这样的努力。虽然这两位伟大的政治家当然只能替他们所代表的十亿亚洲人发言，但是几天以后，缅甸总理和中国总理在仰光发表重新申述了新德里声明的醒目的条文的联合声明，以及后来亚洲人民对于这两项联合声明所表示的欢迎毫无疑问地显示出，当尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理在六月二十八日发表他们的联合声明的时候，他们不仅代表他们自己和印度与中国发言，也同样代表其他许多人发言，这的确是号召用正确的行为把世界从争端矛盾中拯救出来的新生了的亚洲人民的声音，这种声音引起了全世界人民的共鸣。全世界的人民希望听到一个新的声音，这就是国际关系中的新的音符，一种新的哲学，和平的哲学，一部人类行为的法典，在这部法典中宽容、谅解、善良和睦邻政策是占主要地位的。
    这几位亚洲总理所说的是和平、希望、平等和正直的语言。的确，他们所主张的原则并不是什么新的东西，可是他们公开号召人们来重视这些原则并且推荐这些原则来为这个纷扰不宁的世界取得平静这一事实，却有着新的意义。这些原则并不是一些虔诚的客套，而是切实可行的原则，如果遵循这些原则，将会改变世界的面貌。
    亚洲国家由于自己的经历已经知道联合声明中的五项原则是多么必要。当亚洲各国的代言人第一次聚集在一起，他们自然而然地要宣告他们认为能拯救亚洲以至全世界免于陷入国际争端和对立中的正确答案。
    种子在去年六月播下了，长出来的树苗虽然还是幼苗，已经结了果实。联合声明中列举的各项原则业已被许多国家欣然接受为正常国际关系的基本原则。每当爱好和平的人民的领袖会面的时候，他们就重述新德里和仰光声明中所包括的原则并表示赞同。不久以前，当亚洲和非洲的领袖们在万隆举行历史上第一次的聚会时，他们把五项原则发展成为十项原则；最近，在印度总理和苏联部长会议主席的联合声明中，这些原则又一次获得赞同。我相信随着时间的进展，世界上会有更多的爱好和平的人民拥护并且实行这些原则的。
    愿所有相信和宣布赞同这五项原则的国家彼此之间并且同其他国家继续保持亲密的友谊，借以证明这五项原则的实际效用和切实可行。祝他们之间的友谊和合作万古常青，以巩固世界的繁荣和人类的幸福。
    善良的人们万岁！
    国际间的亲善友好万岁！
    和平万岁！
