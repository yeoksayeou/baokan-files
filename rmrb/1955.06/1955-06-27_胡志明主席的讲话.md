Comrade Chairman, dear Comrade Premier:
Friends and Comrades:

　　The delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is very pleased and honored to be invited to the capital of the People's Republic of China for a friendly visit. Our delegation received heartfelt and warm welcome from the brotherly Chinese people along the way from Friendship Pass to Beijing. On behalf of the Vietnamese people, I would like to once again express our sincere gratitude to the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

　　The people of Vietnam and China have a long-standing and profound friendship. For nearly a century, the people of both countries have suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of the imperialists. We are not only friendly neighbors but also brothers in adversity. In recent years, the relationship between the two countries has become increasingly close. The Vietnamese people have been fighting heroically for the liberation of their motherland, and have been selflessly working to heal the wounds of war and restore the national economy after the restoration of peace. They have continuously received warm sympathy and support from the Chinese people. At the same time, every victory achieved by the Chinese people in building their beautiful and strong motherland is regarded by the Vietnamese people as part of their own victory and is celebrated with joy. There is no doubt that the friendship and close relationship between our two peoples are eternal, unbreakable, and cannot be alienated or obstructed by anyone.

　　The Vietnamese and Chinese people stand closely together in the common cause of safeguarding world peace and striving to ease international tensions. This was reflected in the recent Asian-African Conference, especially at the Geneva Conference last year. At the Geneva Conference, the Chinese delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai made extremely important contributions to the success of the Geneva Conference, which played a great role in promoting the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

　　It should be emphasized that the Geneva armistice agreement not only restored peace in Indochina, but also explicitly recognized the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Indochinese people. The Vietnamese people and government are determined to implement all the provisions of the Geneva Accords. Since the ceasefire, the actual actions of the Vietnamese people have proved that we are faithfully implementing the provisions of international agreements. At present, what lies before us is that the responsible authorities with representatives from both regions should hold consultations on the issue of general elections to be held in 1956 to achieve free national general elections, thereby achieving national reunification of Vietnam. This is the sacred and inviolable right of the Vietnamese people, and peace-loving countries and people all over the world will support us. We sincerely hope that the relevant authorities and all countries participating in the Geneva Conference will assume the obligations of the Geneva Accords.

　　While striving for national reunification, we need to further consolidate and expand the work of the National United Front. Today, we will not hold accountable those Vietnamese compatriots who agree with peace, unity, independence, and democracy, and we welcome them to fight for the common cause. We also need to work harder to heal the wounds of war and restore the national economy. In these tasks, the Vietnamese people have shown a high degree of labor enthusiasm in construction and have achieved many successes. For example, the victorious restoration of the Hanoi-Friendship Pass railway line, which the Vietnamese people call the "Peace and Friendship" railway, is a significant construction achievement. In our cause of national construction, we have received strong support from the Soviet Union, China, and many other friendly countries. This valuable friendship and support has become an important force encouraging us to move forward continuously.

　　Today, we urgently need a peaceful international environment to dedicate ourselves to national construction. We need to establish good neighborly relations with surrounding countries. Our government has clearly stated that it is willing to establish normal and friendly relations with any country with different social systems, especially the governments of the two kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, as well as other countries in Southeast Asia, based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence proposed in the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China, India and China, Myanmar, which are practical and feasible. With regard to France, we are also willing to establish normal economic and cultural relations on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Therefore, we also express our full support for the joint statement recently issued by the leaders of the Soviet Union and India.

　　However, the U.S. imperialism and its followers have ulterior motives. They regard peaceful coexistence as a "terrible flood." They are painstakingly trying to obstruct and undermine the Geneva Accords, interfere in the internal affairs of Indochina and various countries, and undermine the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. These conspiracies seriously threaten peace and security in Asia and the world. But the course of history cannot be stopped by any imperialist warmongers. The growing momentum of the world's peace and democratic forces, and the indomitable struggle of the Indochinese people, are a serious blow to the destructive conspiracies of war provocateurs. The Vietnamese people firmly believe that, thanks to their own continuous efforts, coupled with the support of the world's strong peace forces, especially the profound sympathy and support of the great fraternal Soviet and Chinese people, the Vietnamese people's just struggle for peace, unity, independence, and democracy will once again win a glorious victory.

　　On behalf of the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I raise my glass to congratulate:

　　The friendship between the people of Vietnam and China, as solid as a rock, is increasingly consolidated and developed!

　　The forces of peace in Asia and the world are growing stronger!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the great Communist Party of China!

　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the close friend of the Vietnamese people!

### 胡志明主席的讲话

专栏：

    胡志明主席的讲话亲爱的委员长同志、亲爱的总理同志：各位朋友、各位同志：
    越南民主共和国政府代表团应邀来到中华人民共和国的首都作友好的访问，感到十分愉快和荣幸。我们代表团从睦南关到北京沿途受到兄弟的中国人民发自衷心的热情欢迎。我谨代表越南人民再一次地向中国人民、中华人民共和国政府致以真诚的感谢。
    越中两国人民早就有着历史悠久的深厚友谊。近百年来两国人民都曾长期饱受帝国主义者残酷的压迫和剥削，我们不但是友好邻邦，同时也是患难的兄弟。近几年来，两国间的关系愈趋于密切。越南人民在为争取祖国的解放而英勇抗战，和在和平恢复后为医治战争创伤以及恢复国民经济的忘我劳动的过程中，曾不断地得到中国人民的热烈的同情和支持。同时中国人民在建设自己美好强大的祖国时所取得的每一个胜利，越南人民都把它看成是自己胜利的一部分而欢欣鼓舞。无可疑议的，我们两国人民的友谊和密切关系是永恒的、牢不可破的，是任何人所不能离间和阻挠的。
    越南人民和中国人民在维护世界和平和争取缓和国际紧张局势的共同事业中，是紧密地站在一起的。这表现在最近的亚非会议上，特别是去年的日内瓦会议上。在日内瓦会议举行时以周恩来总理为首的中国代表团对日内瓦会议的成就作出极其重要的贡献，这对于推进亚洲和世界和平的事业起了很大的作用。
    应该着重指出，日内瓦停战协议不但恢复了印度支那的和平，而且明确的承认印度支那人民的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。越南人民和政府坚决履行日内瓦协定的一切条款。自从停战至今，越南人民的实际行动证明我们是信守不渝地执行国际协议条款的。目下，摆在我们面前的是双方地区有代表性的负责当局，应该就普选问题进行协商以于一九五六年实行全国自由普选，进而达到越南全国统一。这是越南人民神圣不可侵犯的权利，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民是会给我们支持的。我们深望有关当局和所有参加日内瓦会议的国家承担起日内瓦协议的义务。
    在争取全国统一的同时，我们需要进一步地巩固和扩展民族统一战线工作。今天凡是赞同和平、统一、独立和民主的越南同胞，我们不咎既往，欢迎他们为共同的事业而奋斗。我们也需要更奋发地来医治战争创伤，恢复国民经济。在这些工作中，越南人民表现高度的劳动热情来从事建设，且已取得了不少成就。例如越南人民称为“和平友谊”的铁路，河内—睦南关铁路线的胜利修复就是一个显著的建设成果。在我们进行国家建设的事业中，我们得到苏联、中国和其他许多友好国家大力的支持。这种宝贵友谊的支持，成为鼓舞我们不断前进的重要力量。
    今天，我们迫切需要一个和平的国际环境来献身于国家建设。我们需要和周围的国家建立睦邻关系。我国政府曾经明确的声明，愿意根据中印、中缅总理在联合声明中提出的、切实可行的和平共处的五项原则，和任何不同社会制度的国家，特别是寮国、高棉两个王国政府以及东南亚其他国家建立正常的友好的关系。对于法国，我们也愿意在平等互利的原则上建立有关经济和文化的正常关系。因此，对于苏联、印度两国领袖最近发表的联合声明，我们也表示完全拥护。
    可是美帝国主义及其追随者却别有用心，他们把和平共处看成“洪水猛兽”，他们正在处心积虑地阻挠和破坏日内瓦协议，干涉印度支那和各国的内政，破坏越南的和平统一。这些阴谋严重地威胁了亚洲和世界和平与安全。可是历史的进程不是任何帝国主义好战分子所能加以拦阻的。世界和平民主力量的声势的日益浩大，印度支那人民不屈不挠的斗争，对于战争挑拨者的破坏阴谋是一个严重的打击。越南人民深信，由于自身不断的努力，加以全世界强大的和平力量的支持，特别是伟大的兄弟般的苏联人民和中国人民深切的同情和支持，越南人民为争取和平、统一、独立和民主的正义斗争一定会再一次地赢得光辉的胜利。
    我代表越南民主共和国政府代表团举杯祝贺：
    越、中两国人民坚如磐石的友谊日益巩固和发展！
    亚洲和世界和平力量日益增长和壮大！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖、越南人民亲密的朋友毛泽东主席万岁！
