    Main Efforts Should Not Be Placed on Non-Productive Projects

    To the Editor:

    The capital construction project of the Lengshuitan Logging Yard under the Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau started construction in January 1954, but the plan has never been completed. In 1954, only 34 percent of the annual plan was completed, and in the first quarter of this year, only 37 percent was completed. The plan for the second quarter is also not being implemented well. This is mainly because the Party Branch Secretary of the Logging Yard, Zhou Haishan, and the Yard Director, Wang Furui, and other leading staff members, violated the principle that improvements in living standards must be subordinate to the development of production. They do not pay attention to engineering projects related to production, but instead spend most of their energy and time on non-productive projects. To date, only 57 percent of the productive projects have been completed. Because the important basic production tool, the river dredger, has not been ordered, it has affected the laying of sewers and handcart tracks, paralyzing the entire project. However, 96 percent of the non-productive construction projects, such as office buildings, auditoriums, and bathhouses, have been completed, and last winter, money was spent on buying coal for heating to rush the work.

    Due to blind construction and simply pursuing extravagance, the backlog and waste of this project are very serious. According to preliminary investigations, it amounts to 70,000 yuan, accounting for more than 11 percent of the total investment in the past two years.

    This capital construction unit also violated the principle of saving land and wasted a lot of land. Of the 249 mu of land requisitioned in January 1954, 110 mu of land are still barren and unused, of which 40 mu could be saved. Local farmers have a lot of complaints about the barren land, but the leading staff members of the Logging Yard do not care.

    The Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau should immediately strengthen its leadership and inspection of this project to reverse the current situation.

### 不应该把主要精力放在非生产性的工程上

    不应该把主要精力放在非生产性的工程上编辑同志：
    湖南省森林工业局冷水滩集材场基本建设工程在一九五四年一月开始施工，计划一直完不成。一九五四年只完成年度计划的百分之三十四，今年第一季度计划只完成百分之三十七，第二季度计划也执行得不好。这主要是因为集材场的党支部书记周海山和场长王福瑞等领导工作人员，违背生活改善必须服从生产发展的原则，不重视有关生产的工程项目，却把大部精力和时间用在非生产性工程上。生产性工程到目前只完成计划的百分之五十七；由于重要基础生产工具出河机没有订货，影响了下水道和手车道的铺设，使整个工程陷于瘫痪状态。而非生产性建筑工程的办公大楼、礼堂、澡堂等已完成计划的百分之九十六，去年冬季还曾花钱买炭来取暖赶工。
    由于盲目施工和单纯追求富丽堂皇，这个工程的积压浪费现象很严重。据初步调查达七万元，占两年来投资总额的百分之十一以上。
    这个基本建设单位还违反节约用地原则，浪费了不少土地。一九五四年一月征购的二百四十九亩土地，现在还有一百一十亩土地荒芜没有用，其中有四十亩是可以节省的。当地农民对土地荒芜现象很有意见，但集材场的领导工作人员还满不在乎。
    湖南省森林工业局应该立即加强对这个工程的领导和检查，以扭转目前这种状况。    衡工
