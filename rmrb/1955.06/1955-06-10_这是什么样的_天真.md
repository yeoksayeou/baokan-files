　　Hu Feng's thought criticism had just begun,
　　A responsible comrade flipped through the newspaper:
　　"Literary disputes, nothing to do with us.
　　Articles so long, who has time to read!"
　　Hu Feng's thought criticism unfolded not long after,
　　A certain musician frowned:
　　"Sorry! I'm a musician.
　　I don't understand anything about literary matters."
　　The ideological struggle deepened step by step,
　　But a certain writer said: "Let the theorists handle the theory,
　　I've never been interested in Hu Feng's articles,
　　The writing is awkward, I really can't understand it."
　　More and more people are participating in the struggle,
　　Only a certain professor said he was mature and prudent:
　　"Who is right and who is wrong, we have to wait and see.
　　Only superficial people follow others blindly."
　　The symposium is about to end, and more people are speaking:
　　"Isn't it that bad? I think it's almost over."
　　"I just feel that the current articles are not convincing enough."
　　"Is it raised too high, a bit too much?"
　　The fierce class struggle breaks through obstacles and moves forward,
　　More and more people have their eyes opened.
　　The coats of "Marxism-Leninism" and "revolutionary writer" are stripped off one by one,
　　Revealing the original form of hidden counter-revolutionary elements.
　　At this time, those overly kind people,
　　This one opened his mouth wide, that one widened his eyes:
　　"Our sense of smell is not good, our thinking has problems."
　　"Oh dear! We are really too naive!"
　　Comrades! What kind of "naivete" is this?
　　Reactionary elements are determined to bring down the revolutionary regime!
　　Some of us are always careless and casual,
　　Blowing smoke rings: "It's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing..."

    这是什么样的“天真”
    袁水拍
    胡风思想批判刚一展开，
    一位负责同志把报纸翻了一翻：
    “文艺界的纠纷，咱们不相干。
    文章这末长，哪有时间看！”
    胡风思想批判展开不久，
    某音乐家把眉头一皱：
   “对不起！我是搞音乐的。
    文学的事儿一点也不摸头。”
    思想斗争一步一步深化，
    可是某作家说：“理论让理论家管吧，
    胡风的文章我向来兴趣不大，
    文字蹩扭，实在看不懂它。”
    越来越多的人参加到斗争当中，
    独有某教授表示他老成持重：
   “究竟谁是谁非，还得等着瞧。
    只有浅薄的人才跟着人家起哄。”
    座谈会快开完，发言的人比较多：
    “没有那末坏吧？我看已经差不多。”
    “我只觉得目前的文章说服力不够。”
    “是不是提得太高了，有点过火？”
    激烈的阶级斗争冲破障碍前进，
    越来越多的人擦亮了眼睛。
    “马列主义”“革命作家”的外衣一件件剥掉，
    露出了暗藏的反革命分子原形。
    这时候，那些过分好心的人们，
    这个张大了嘴巴，那个瞪起了眼睛：
    “我们的嗅觉不灵，思想有毛病。”
    “嗳呀！我们真是太天真！”
    同志们！这是什么样的“天真”啊？
    反动分子决心要把革命政权搞垮！
    我们有些人却老是马马虎虎，随随便便，
    吐着烟圈儿：“没啥，没啥，没啥……”
