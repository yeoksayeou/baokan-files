Zhaodong County Urban Area Properly Resettles Demobilized Soldiers

The work of resettling demobilized construction soldiers in the urban area of Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, has been done well. In addition to solving long-term and fixed occupations for most demobilized construction soldiers, they have also organized some demobilized construction soldiers to participate in production labor.

In late March of this year, the district office formed a civil engineering production team with forty-four demobilized construction soldiers who did not have fixed occupations, and also absorbed some families of martyrs, military dependents, and poor citizens. This production team selected one of the demobilized construction soldiers as the team leader, and divided into four groups, each selecting four group leaders. The work of the civil engineering production team is to contract for building and repairing houses, dismantling kang [traditional northern Chinese brick bed-stove], plastering walls, and other civil engineering tasks. When some organs, enterprises, or institutions need civil engineering construction, the district introduces this production team to do the work. At ordinary times, the groups also go out to solicit work themselves. Since its establishment, the work has never been interrupted. A total of more than 1,370 houses have been repaired for the Property Management Office, Transportation Company, and schools, earning nearly 4,000 yuan, and accumulating more than 300 yuan of public reserve funds, basically guaranteeing their livelihoods. Because this civil engineering production team frequently holds meetings to study how to improve work quality, and carries out criticism and self-criticism, all the members of the team have a high production enthusiasm and good work results. Recently, it received a banner from the contracting unit. The production team is currently preparing to build more than 40 houses for the Grain Bureau and the Electric Light Company; and plans to take out some people to cut sheep grass and carry out other sideline production during the hot season.

    肇东县城区妥善安置复员军人
    黑龙江省肇东县城区安置复员建设军人的工作做得较好，除给大多数复员建设军人解决了长期固定的职业以外，并组织部分复员建设军人参加了生产劳动。
    今年三月下旬，区公所把四十四名没有固定职业的复员建设军人组成了一个土木生产组，并吸收了一部分烈属、军属和贫困市民。这个生产组由复员建设军人中选出一人担任组长，下分四个小组，分别选出四个小组长。土木生产组的工作是承包修盖房子、扒炕、抹墙等土木活计。有些机关企业单位需要土木建筑时，即由区里介绍这个生产组去作，平时小组也自己出去揽活。自从成立到现在，活计始终没有间断，共给房产处、运输公司和学校补修房屋一千三百七十多间，挣了将近四千元，积累了三百多元公积金，基本上保证了生活。这个土木生产组由于经常开会研究提高工作质量，开展批评和自我批评，全组人员生产热情很高，工作成绩很好，最近得到了包工单位一面旗子。这个生产组目前正准备给粮食局和电灯公司修建四十多间房子；并计划在伏天期间，抽出一部分人去打羊草和进行其它副业生产。　（张维群、李春荣）
