    Zhejiang Province's coastal fishing areas have achieved a bumper spring catch. This year, Zhejiang Province has put more than 20,000 fishing boats into production, with over 100,000 fishermen. According to statistics from late May, the total output of large yellow croaker, cuttlefish, small yellow croaker, and large sharks reached 1.5 million dan. The output of large yellow croaker was 630,000 dan, equivalent to the total annual output of large yellow croaker last year. The first haul of large yellow croaker in the Maotou Ocean area of Zhoushan reached 120,000 dan, an increase of twelve times compared to the same period last year. The output of cuttlefish in Wenzhou and Zhoushan reached 260,000 dan, an increase of one time over the total annual output of cuttlefish last year. This year, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee has issued more than one million yuan in fishery loans, added two production guidance vessels in the Wenzhou and Ningbo fishing areas, and built nine more storm warning stations, equipping fishermen with one hundred radios. These measures have strongly supported fishery production and ensured the safety of fishermen's production. Currently, the coastal area's Party committees are leading fishermen to venture out to sea for the third haul of fishing, striving to complete the annual target of six million dan of marine fish.

    浙江省沿海渔区春汛鱼产丰收
    浙江省沿海渔区春汛鱼产丰收。浙江省今年投入生产的渔船二万多只，有十万多渔民，到五月下旬统计，共产大黄鱼、墨鱼、小黄鱼、大鲨鱼一百五十万担。大黄鱼产六十三万担，相当去年全年大黄鱼的总产量。舟山猫头洋第一水大黄鱼生产十二万担，比去年同期增产十二倍。温州、舟山墨鱼生产二十六万担，比去年全年墨鱼产量增加一倍。浙江省人民委员会今年发放了一百多万元的渔业贷款，并在温州、宁波两渔区增设了两只生产指导船，还增建了九个暴风警报站，给渔民配备了一百只收音机，这些都有力地支援了渔业生产，保障了渔民生产安全。现在沿海地区的党委正领导渔民出洋进行第三水捕鱼。争取全年完成六百万担海洋鱼的指标。　（本报驻杭州记者）
