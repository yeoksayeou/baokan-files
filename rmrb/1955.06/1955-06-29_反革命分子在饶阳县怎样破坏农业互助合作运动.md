    How Counter-Revolutionaries Sabotaged the Agricultural Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement in Raoyang County
    Lu An
    Raoyang County in Hebei Province is a county where the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed relatively well. By January of this year, the number of peasant households joining agricultural production cooperatives accounted for about 80 percent of the total number of households in the county. There were thirty-seven townships that had been completely cooperativized, and one hundred and sixty-five villages that had been either completely or basically cooperativized. The nationally famous agricultural production cooperative led by Geng Changsuo in Wugong Village is located in this county.
    The development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement signifies a great victory for the socialist transformation cause in the countryside and means the continuous improvement of people's lives. This is what the enemy extremely hates. Therefore, in Raoyang County, especially in townships, villages, and agricultural production cooperatives where the mutual aid and cooperation movement developed faster, the enemy did everything possible to carry out crazy sabotage. According to incomplete statistics, from 1952 to 1954, a total of thirty-four cases of enemy sabotage of the mutual aid and cooperation movement occurred in Raoyang County, and this kind of sabotage increased year by year with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. For example, only two sabotage cases occurred in the county in 1952, increasing to eight in 1953, and then to twenty-four in 1954.
    In the early stage of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, when the masses lacked practical experience in the superiority of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and we temporarily lacked experience in running cooperatives, the enemy mainly carried out sabotage from the outside to obstruct the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. At that time, the means adopted by the enemy were: spreading rumors to confuse the public, arson, destroying crops and production tools, and creating chaos and terror. For example, in Wugong Village, there was a case of arson at three locations in one night. Many villages circulated rumors that "the agricultural production cooperative led by Geng Changsuo lost money, Geng Changsuo was so worried that he ran away and was detained." The enemy attempted to use this method to dampen the enthusiasm of farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations.
    When the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants gradually increased and the mutual aid and cooperation movement flourished, the enemy, in addition to continuing to carry out sabotage from the outside, also cunningly disguised themselves and sneaked into agricultural production cooperatives to carry out covert sabotage activities. Their method was to sow discord and undermine unity within the cooperative in order to achieve the goal of disintegrating the cooperative. The fifth production team of the agricultural production cooperative led by Geng Changsuo in Wugong Village was affected because bad elements sowed discord, causing the team members' production morale to be scattered and inciting some team members to go on strike, seriously affecting production. Li Jinbo, a puppet military officer in Siji Village, took advantage of the serious flooding of the village to incite cooperative members who had fodder to refuse to feed the cooperative's livestock, which not only caused the death of several livestock but also seriously dampened the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members.
    After sneaking into mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the enemy often pretended to be progressive. After gaining the trust of leaders and the masses and stealing certain positions, they carried out various conspiracies of sabotage. A backbone element of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang who infiltrated an agricultural production cooperative in Yizhihe Village and served as a chicken-raising technician killed more than eighty chickens in just over a month. A former puppet police chief who infiltrated the Party in Wugong Village tried his best to carry out provocative activities among the cooperative members when Geng Changsuo visited the Soviet Union in 1952, attempting to replace Geng Changsuo and usurp the position of the cooperative director.
    Stealing, encroaching, and embezzling the public property of agricultural production cooperatives is a consistent method used by the enemy to carry out sabotage after infiltrating mutual aid and cooperation organizations. They attempt to use this method to directly shake the economic foundation of mutual aid and cooperation organizations and disintegrate them. Such sabotage cases that have occurred in Raoyang County in recent years account for more than 60 percent of the cases of sabotage of agricultural production cooperatives. An agricultural production cooperative in Tunli Village collapsed because the enemy stole draft animals, causing production difficulties. Some reactionary elements, after infiltrating agricultural production cooperatives, not only carried out theft activities themselves, but also used certain backward elements to organize collective theft. For example, Li Fuzeng, who once served as the accountant of the agricultural production cooperative led by Geng Changsuo (who had joined forces with rich peasants to launch a counterattack against the peasants, wrote reactionary slogans, and sabotaged the work of recruiting and replenishing soldiers), colluded with several backward elements to collectively steal more than 1,000 jin of wheat from the cooperative at one time. Incidents of the enemy stealing public funds, livestock, and farm tools from agricultural production cooperatives have occurred in many districts and villages in Raoyang County.
    奸商[奸商=unscrupulous merchants, profiteers] who have infiltrated agricultural production cooperatives use speculative business operations and black market activities to try to change the nature of the cooperative. The four directors and deputy directors (two of whom were 奸商) of the Xinsheng and Peasant agricultural production cooperatives in Woti Village secretly purchased more than 20,000 jin of oil-bearing materials such as peanuts and black beans after the state implemented the unified purchase of edible oil, and evaded more than 1,100 yuan in national taxes.
    The facts of the counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary elements who have been uncovered in Raoyang County over the years sabotaging the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement show that the enemy is actively carrying out sabotage against the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The process of agricultural collectivization is a sharp class struggle. However, some of our rural staff members are often satisfied with the achievements of the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and become careless about the enemy's sabotage activities, resulting in great losses. This must be overcome.

    反革命分子在饶阳县怎样破坏农业互助合作运动
    陆安
    河北省饶阳县是一个农业互助合作运动比较发展的县份，到今年一月间，全县加入农业生产合作社的农户约占全县总户数的百分之八十，已经全部合作化的乡有三十七个，已经全部合作化或基本合作化的村有一百六十五个。全国著名的五公村耿长锁领导的农业生产合作社就在这个县里。
    农业的互助合作运动的发展，意味着社会主义改造事业在农村的一大胜利，意味着人民生活的不断改善。而这是敌人所极端仇视的。因此，在饶阳县，特别在互助合作运动发展较快的乡、村和农业生产合作社，敌人千方百计进行了疯狂的破坏。据不完全统计，从一九五二年到一九五四年，饶阳县共发生敌人破坏互助合作运动案件三十四件，而这种破坏更是随着互助合作运动的发展而逐年增加。如一九五二年全县仅发生破坏案件二起，一九五三年增加到八起，一九五四年则达到二十四起。
    当互助合作运动发展初期，群众对农业生产互助合作的优越性还缺乏实际体验和我们还暂时缺乏办社经验的时候，敌人主要是从外部进行破坏，以阻挠互助合作运动的发展。当时敌人所采取的手段是：造谣惑众，纵火，毁坏农作物和生产工具，制造混乱和恐怖。如五公村曾经发生一夜三处纵火案。许多村都流传着“耿长锁领导的农业生产合作社赔钱了，耿长锁愁跑了，被扣了”的谣言，敌人企图用这种手段打击农民参加互助合作组织的积极性。
    当广大农民的社会主义觉悟逐步提高、互助合作运动蓬勃发展起来的时候，敌人除了继续由外部进行破坏以外，还狡猾地伪装起来，钻进农业生产合作社里，进行暗中破坏的活动。其办法是挑拨离间，破坏社内团结，以便达到瓦解社的目的。五公村耿长锁领导的农业生产合作社第五生产队，就是由于坏分子从中挑拨，使队员生产情绪涣散，煽动部分队员怠工，严重影响了生产。思吉村伪军官李金波趁大水围村，灾情严重的时候，煽动有饲草的社员拒绝饲养社里的牲口，不仅使数头牲口遭到死亡，而且严重地打击了社员的生产积极性。
    敌人在混入互助合作组织之后，常常伪装进步，在骗得领导和群众的信任及窃取了一定职务之后，便进行各种阴谋破坏。一致合村的一个蒋匪国民党骨干分子混入农业生产合作社担任了养鸡技术员，在一个多月之中，就弄死八十多只鸡。五公村的一个混入党内的伪警长，在一九五二年耿长锁到苏联参观的时候，在社员中竭力进行挑拨活动，企图把耿长锁改选掉，篡夺社长的职务。
    偷盗、侵吞和贪污农业生产合作社公有财产，是敌人钻入互助合作组织进行破坏的一贯方法，他们企图用这种办法直接动摇互助合作组织的经济基础，使互助合作组织解体。饶阳县几年来所发生的此类破坏案件，占破坏农业生产合作社案件的百分之六十强。屯里村的一个农业生产合作社，就因为被敌人偷去耕畜、生产困难而垮了。一些反动分子混入农业生产合作社以后，不仅自己进行盗窃活动，而且利用某些落后分子组织集体盗窃。如曾任耿长锁领导的农业生产合作社的会计的李福增（曾联合富农向农民进行反攻，写反动标语，破坏征集补充兵员工作等）拉拢数名落后分子一次集体盗窃社内小麦一千多斤。敌人盗窃农业生产合作社公款、牲畜、农具等事件，在饶阳县许多区、村都发生过。
    混入农业生产合作社的奸商，用经营投机商业、从事黑市活动的办法，图谋使社变质。窝堤村新生、农民两个农业生产合作社的四个正副社长（两个是奸商），竟在国家实行食油统购后，偷购花生、黑豆等油料二万多斤，偷漏国税一千一百多元。
    饶阳县历年来破获的反革命分子和反动分子破坏农业互助合作运动的事实表明，敌人正在积极对互助合作运动实行破坏。农业合作化的过程，是一个尖锐的阶级斗争的过程。但我们有些农村工作人员却往往满足于互助合作运动发展的成绩，对敌人的破坏活动麻痹大意起来，结果造成很大的损失，这是必须注意克服的。
