    In the Manjiang Tea Region
    Gong Xunren
    Manjiang is a tributary of the upper reaches of the Xiu River in Jiangxi Province. The red tea produced in Manjiang, Dushi, Xinan, Nanling, Wayang, and other places within its watershed, together with the tea produced in Tonggu and Wuning counties, are collectively known as "Ninghong," which enjoys a high reputation in the international market. This year, the spring tea in the Manjiang River basin achieved the largest harvest since liberation.
    In Manjiang Township, I visited the Manjiang Red Tea Preliminary Processing Plant. This was jointly established by nine tea farmer mutual aid groups in Maoping Village. Organizing collective tea making not only overcame the difficulties of the tea farmers being busy with two things at once but also further improved the quality of the red tea. For many years, there has been a popular saying in the Manjiang area: "When the rice is planted, the tea is old; when the tea is picked, the wheat is yellow." In the past, whenever spring tea sprouted, regardless of the amount of tea, they had to pick it themselves, make it themselves, and then carry it to sell themselves, which not only wasted time but often, because of the urgency of agricultural work, they would lose sight of one thing while attending to the other. When the Mojia Kuan mutual aid group picked spring tea in 1954, the soybean seedlings in the field were seven or eight inches high and had not yet been fertilized. After participating in the tea making plant this year, not only was the early rice transplanted earlier than in 1954, but the 26 mu of soybean land was universally fertilized when the seedlings were only two or three inches high. They also took out labor to reclaim more than three mu of wasteland, preparing to plant new tea gardens after autumn. Due to organized collective tea making, the quality of red tea this year is generally one grade higher than in 1954. Among the 1,200 jin of dry rough tea produced by the preliminary processing plant during the spring tea season, 85 percent met the standard of first-grade tea.
    With increased production and improved quality, the income of tea farmers has generally increased, and their enthusiasm for managing tea trees has also greatly increased. On Ma'anshan Mountain on the east bank of the Manjiang River, 280 mu of barren tea gardens are to be reclaimed this autumn, and it is planned to widely plant new tea trees on the higher-lying sandbars on the west bank of the Manjiang River this winter and next spring. In order to ensure the completion of this plan, the tea farmers in Manjiang Township immediately ordered 20,000 jin of lime from the supply and marketing cooperative after selling the spring tea, preparing to apply it when reclaiming the tea gardens.

    在漫江茶区
    龚循仁
    漫江是江西省修河上游的一条支流，在它流域范围内的漫江、杜市、溪南、南岭、瓦阳等地所产的红茶，和铜鼓、武宁两县出产的茶叶一并称为“宁红”，在国际市场上很有声誉。今年漫江流域的春茶，获得了解放以来的最大丰收。
    在漫江乡，我参观了漫江红茶初制所。这是由茅坪村九个茶农互助组联合创办的。组织起来集体制茶，不仅克服了茶农两忙的困难，而且进一步提高了红茶的品质。多少年来，漫江一带就流行着这样一句话：“栽得禾来茶又老，采得茶来麦又黄。”过去，每当春茶萌发的时候，不管茶叶多少，都得自己去采，自己去制，然后还得自己挑去卖，浪费时间不说，往往因为农事紧迫，顾了这头，就丢了那头。莫家宽互助组一九五四年春茶采摘的时候，地里的豆苗长到七八寸高还没有施肥，今年参加制茶所以后，不但早禾比一九五四年提早了插秧，二十六亩黄豆地才出苗两三寸就普遍下齐了肥料，还抽出劳力开垦了三亩多荒地，准备秋后播种新茶园。由于组织起来集体制茶，今年红茶的品质普遍比一九五四年提高了一级以上。初制所在春茶阶段制成的一千二百斤干毛茶中，有百分之八十五达到一级茶的标准。
    产量增加，质量提高，茶农们收入普遍增加，经营茶树的积极性也大大提高。在漫江东岸的马鞍山上，今年秋季准备垦复荒芜茶园二百八十亩，并且计划今冬明春在漫江西岸地势较高的洲地上，广泛栽种新茶树。漫江乡的茶农们为了保证完成这一计划，在出售春茶后，马上同供销合作社订购了两万斤石灰，准备在垦复茶园时施用。
