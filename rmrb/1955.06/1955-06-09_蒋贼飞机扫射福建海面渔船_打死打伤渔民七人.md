Xinhua News Agency, Front Line, Fujian, 8th. At 2:33 PM on June 6th, four American-made Chiang Kai-shek F-47 fighter planes intruded into the Tuyu'an area west of the Shenhu Bay in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, and frantically strafed over eighty fishing boats returning from fishing at sea. They strafed five times, killing two fishermen, wounding five fishermen, sinking one fishing boat, and damaging three fishing boats.

    When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes were bombing and strafing the fishermen, militiamen and stretcher teams from the Shenhu area rushed to the scene to carry out rescue operations. They used sampans to transport the injured fishermen ashore for bandaging, and sent the seriously injured fishermen to hospitals in Quanzhou City for emergency treatment. The fishermen killed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes have been properly buried by the local government. The Party and government organs of Jinjiang County have also sent working groups to express condolences and provide relief to the affected fishermen and their families. The local fishermen expressed great anger at the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes, and expressed their determination to avenge the fishermen who suffered.

    蒋贼飞机扫射福建海面渔船
    打死打伤渔民七人
    新华社福建前线八日电　六日下午二时三十三分，美造蒋贼F—四七型飞机四架窜进福建省晋江县深沪湾以西土屿埯一带，向海上捕鱼归来的八十多只渔船进行疯狂扫射。共扫射五次，打死渔民二人，打伤渔民五人，打沉渔船一只，打伤渔船三只。
    当蒋贼飞机正在向渔民轰炸扫射时，深沪一带的民兵和担架队都赶到出事地点进行抢救。他们把受伤的渔民用舢板送上岸进行包扎，并把受重伤的渔民送到泉州市的医院里进行急救。被蒋贼飞机打死的渔民已经由当地政府妥善安葬。晋江县的党政机关并派出工作组对受难渔民和家属进行慰问和救济。当地渔民对蒋贼飞机的暴行表示极大的愤怒，纷纷表示要为受难的渔民报仇。
