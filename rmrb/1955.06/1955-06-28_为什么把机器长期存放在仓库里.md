Why are Machines Kept in Warehouses for Long Periods?
　　　　Wu Rongjiang
　　In the Huainan Mining Bureau, thirty-three Hungarian wind drills have been stored untouched in large wooden boxes in warehouses for a long time, and several hundred-meter-long double-trough scraper conveyors have had their troughs piled up in warehouses and open-air spaces for a long time.
　　It cost a lot of money to purchase these machines; for example, "six double-trough scraper conveyors cost more than 226,000 yuan"; moreover, it was not easy to purchase these machines and transport them to the Huainan Coal Mine. Taking the double-trough scraper conveyor as an example, the Huainan Mining Bureau sent the deputy chief of the equipment procurement section to other places to purchase them as early as February last year. At that time, they could not buy it because China had not yet produced this type of double-trough scraper conveyor. The Huainan Mining Bureau repeatedly applied to the Coal Mine Management Bureau, saying that production "urgently needed" it and that the Coal Mine Management Bureau must help buy this machine. The Coal Mine Management Bureau convened meetings of various relevant departments within the bureau to study this matter, and finally decided that the Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Factory would imitate the latest Soviet-style double-trough scraper conveyor used in thin coal seams to carry out trial production. A lot of manpower and material resources were also spent in the trial production and transportation process. Who would have thought that these "urgently needed" machines would be stored in warehouses for a long time after being transported to the Huainan Mining Bureau?
　　If you want to ask why these hard-won and "urgently needed" machines have been stockpiled for a long time without being used, please first look at why the Huainan Mining Bureau purchased these machines. In 1953, the Huainan Mining Bureau had a surplus of more than 500,000 yuan in its annual maintenance and production engineering expenses. According to regulations, this money should have been turned over to the state. However, they used it to buy double-trough scraper conveyors for thin coal seams. As for whether production needed them at the time, how many were needed, and when they were needed, they did not consider these issues. They only thought that it would not be bad to buy more machines for storage anyway, and they would always be useful when production developed in the future. After six double-trough scraper conveyors for thin coal seams were transported to Huainan, the Mining Bureau distributed one to the Caijiagang Coal Mine. However, at that time, the Caijiagang Coal Mine did not have a thin coal seam mining working face, and even now the preparatory work for mining thin coal seams has not been completed. Therefore, this new machine has been disassembled and placed in an open-air space since October last year, exposed to the sun, rain, and wind. In January of this year, the Mining Bureau transported three more double-trough scraper conveyors to the Xinzhuangzi Coal Mine, which also stockpiled them. Only two have been used so far, and they are used intermittently.
　　Since these double-trough scraper conveyors are currently not suitable for use in the Huainan Mining Bureau, the Coal Mine Management Bureau instructed the Huainan Mining Bureau to allocate them to other coal mines that needed them. However, the Huainan Mining Bureau was afraid that they would have no reserves if they were allocated, so they would rather stockpile them than transfer them out. It was not until March of this year, under the repeated instructions of the Coal Mine Management Bureau, that one unit was allocated to a coal mine in Southwest China, and the rest were still stockpiled.
　　Another reason for the stockpiling of machines is that some staff in the production department do not actively study new technologies, so some machines that could be used have not been used. For example, according to the Huainan Mining Bureau's plan to order heavy wind drills, the Coal Mine Management Bureau allocated thirty-eight Hungarian wind drills to them from foreign orders. In July last year, when these Hungarian wind drills were transported to the Huainan Coal Mine, someone said: "They are not heavy wind drills, they cannot be used." The Datong Coal Mine took one to try it out once, but because they did not wipe off the oil stains on the machine, it was not very flexible to use. They then arbitrarily said: "The air blowing volume is not large, it is air-locking, the efficiency is low, and it is not suitable for use," and they stockpiled the wind drill in the warehouse and never used it again. Other coal mines, seeing that the Datong Coal Mine's experiment was not successful, were unwilling to use it again. Is it true that Hungarian wind drills are not heavy and are really not easy to use? Not necessarily. The Huainan Mining Bureau's Technology Section conducted an experiment in February of this year, which proved that the efficiency of this type of wind drill in medium-hard or less rock is not lower than that of heavy wind drills. The workers believe that this type of wind drill is light and easy to use. Most of the mines under the Huainan Mining Bureau are composed of medium-hard or less rock, so these wind drills can be used in most of them. However, even now, the Huainan Mining Bureau has not actively urged its subordinate mines to use them.
　　In November last year, the Huainan Mining Bureau's People's Supervision Correspondent criticized the stockpiling of these two types of new machines, and the Huainan Mining Bureau's Supervision Office conducted an investigation and put forward opinions on how to deal with it, but it still did not attract the attention of the Huainan Mining Bureau. The Huainan Mining Bureau should immediately deal with these stockpiled machines. Those that can be allocated to other bureaus should be transferred out quickly, and those that can be used by this bureau should be used quickly. There is no reason to let these machines sleep in the warehouse for a long time!

### 为什么把机器长期存放在仓库里

    为什么把机器长期存放在仓库里
    吴荣江
    在淮南矿务局，有三十三台匈牙利风锤原封未动地长期被存放在仓库的大木箱里，有数台一百公尺长的双溜槽链板运输机的溜槽长期被堆积在仓库里和露天空场上。
    购买这些机器都曾花了很多钱，单是“六台双溜槽链板运输机就用了二十二万六千多元”；而且，购买了这些机器再运到淮南煤矿来也很不容易。以双溜槽链板运输机为例，从去年二月，淮南矿务局就派设备采购科副科长到外地去采购。当时因我国还没有生产这种双溜槽链板运输机而没有买到。淮南矿务局再三向煤矿管理总局提出申请，说是生产上“迫切需要”，一定要煤矿管理总局帮助买到这种机器。煤矿管理总局为此曾召集局内各有关部门开会研究，最后决定由张家口矿山机械制造厂仿照苏联煤矿薄煤层使用的最新式的双溜槽链板运输机进行试制。在试制过程和运输过程也付出很多人力和物力。谁会料到，这些“迫切需要”的机器运到淮南矿务局就长期睡在仓库里呢。
    如果要问这些来之不易的和“迫切需要”的机器为什么被长期地积压不用，请先看看淮南矿务局为什么采购这些机器吧。一九五三年，淮南矿务局的年度维持生产工程费用节余了五十多万元，按照规定，这笔款子是应该上缴的。但是他们却用来买了薄煤层使用的双溜槽链板运输机，至于当时生产上是否需要，需要多少，什么时候需要等问题，他们是没有考虑的，只是想到多买些机器储存总没有什么坏处，反正以后生产发展了总会用得上。当六台薄煤层使用的双溜槽链板运输机运到淮南后，矿务局就分给所属蔡家岗煤矿一台。但是，当时蔡家岗煤矿并没有薄煤层采煤工作面，而且直到现在开采薄煤层的准备工作还没有做好。因此这台新机器从去年十月份起，就被拆开放在露天空场上，任凭日晒夜露，风吹雨打。今年一月份，矿务局又将三台双溜槽链板运输机运给所属新庄孜煤矿，而新庄孜煤矿也将它积压下来，直到现在，才用上两台，也是时开时停。
    这些双溜槽链板运输机目前在淮南矿务局既然不适用，煤矿管理总局就指示淮南矿务局调拨给其他需要的煤矿使用，但是淮南矿务局却怕调拨出去自己就没有储备了，因此宁可积压也不愿外调。直到今年三月份，在煤矿管理总局再次指示下，才拨了一台给西南某煤矿使用，其余的仍旧积压着。
    机器积压的再一个原因，是生产部门的某些工作人员不积极钻研新技术，因此某些可以使用的机器也没有使用。如煤矿管理总局根据淮南矿务局订购重型风锤的计划，从国外订货中给他们调拨了三十八部匈牙利风锤。去年七月份，这些匈牙利风锤运到淮南煤矿，就有人说：“不是重型风锤，不能用。”大通煤矿拿一部去试用了一次，因为没有把机器上的油垢擦洗干净，使用起来不太灵活，他们就武断地说：“吹风量不大，蹩风，效率低，不合用”，就把风锤积存在仓库里再不使用了。其他煤矿看到大通煤矿试验没成功，也不愿再使用。是不是匈牙利风锤不是重型的，就真的不好用呢？并不是。淮南矿务局技术处在今年二月份曾作了一次试验，证明这种风锤在中硬以下岩石中使用的效率，并不低于重型风锤。工人们认为这种风锤轻巧，也很欢喜使用。而淮南矿务局所属各矿大都是中硬以下岩石，因此也大都可以使用这些风锤，但是直到现在，淮南矿务局还没有积极督促所属各矿使用。
    去年十一月，淮南矿务局人民监察通讯员曾对积压这两种新机器的事提出批评，并经淮南矿务局监察室作了调查和提出处理意见，但仍没有引起淮南矿务局的重视。淮南矿务局应该立即处理这些积压的机器，可以调拨给他局使用的应赶快调出，本局有条件使用的更应赶快使用，没有理由再让这些机器长期在库里睡觉了！
