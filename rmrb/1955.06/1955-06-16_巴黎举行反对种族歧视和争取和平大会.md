Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 14th: The National Day Conference of France Against Racial Discrimination, Anti-Semitism, and for Peace was held in Paris on the 12th. Approximately two thousand representatives and guests attended the conference, including Honorary Speaker of the French National Assembly Herriot, the famous French peace fighter and Chairman of the World Peace Council Joliot-Curie, and Father Pierre.

    The representatives passed a motion mourning the Rosenbergs, who were innocently executed by the American authorities in 1953.

    The representatives also decided to establish an anti-racism prize, which will be awarded annually to a work of literature or art.

    The Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace sent a telegram a few days ago congratulating the conference on its success.
