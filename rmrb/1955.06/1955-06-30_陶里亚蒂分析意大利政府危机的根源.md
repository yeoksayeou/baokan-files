    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 27th (TASS):
    "Unità" published an editorial written by Togliatti regarding the Italian government crisis. Togliatti first pointed out that divisions within the ruling party camp had occurred months ago, but the differences and contradictions are still being concealed by all possible means. Togliatti wrote that two situations led to the maturation of the government crisis. Domestically, it is the new offensive of the employers; internationally, it is the clear expression of the American ruling group that they absolutely will not allow the Italian government to adopt a stance in favor of easing international tensions, and they express obvious dissatisfaction with even the slightest possibility in this regard.
    Togliatti said that within both the Social Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Party, there are considerable forces who absolutely do not want to become stepping stones for big entrepreneurs and big landlords to achieve absolute rule. Enterprises, rural areas, trade unions, and other organizations in the country should widely discuss these issues, so as to generate a stronger and more united movement domestically, paving the way for new policies, just as in the past they prompted the collapse of the Scelba government.
    Togliatti concluded by writing: "In the struggle to tenaciously defend its independence, Italy will certainly seek and will find new paths, proving to everyone Italy's will to fight for peace."
    Italy's progressive groups insist that the solution to the government crisis should be based on compliance with the constitution and satisfaction of the demands of the working masses. The Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labor passed a resolution demanding the establishment of a new government prepared to resolve the issues that the working people unanimously demand to be resolved. These issues include: the reform of land use contracts, ensuring that Italy's oil and other raw material resources are not manipulated by monopoly capital organizations, taking measures to eliminate the causes of the serious crisis suffered by certain major economic sectors, and implementing plans to invest in industry and agriculture so that the vast majority of the unemployed can immediately obtain work, etc.

    陶里亚蒂分析意大利政府危机的根源
    新华社二十八日讯　据塔斯社罗马二十七日讯：
    “团结报”刊载了陶里亚蒂写的关于意大利政府危机的一篇社论。陶里亚蒂首先指出，早在几个月以前，执政党阵营中就发生了分裂，但是，分歧和矛盾直到现在还是被千方百计地掩盖着。陶里亚蒂写道，有两种情况导致政府危机的成熟。在国内，就是雇主们的新的进攻；在国际上，就是美国统治集团明显地表现出，他们绝对不许意大利政府做出赞成缓和国际紧张局势政策的姿态，他们对这方面的一点点微小的可能都表示明显的不满。
    陶里亚蒂说，无论在社会民主党或是天主教民主党内部，都有相当大的一部分力量绝对不愿成为供大企业家和大地主利用来取得绝对统治的踏脚石。国内各企业、农村、工会和其他团体应该广泛地讨论这些问题，以便在国内产生一种更加强大的、团结的运动，像过去促使谢尔巴政府垮台一样，为新的政策铺平道路。
    陶里亚蒂最后写道：“意大利在顽强地保卫自己独立的斗争中必定会寻求并且将找到新的道路，向所有的人证明意大利争取和平的意志。”
    意大利的进步团体坚持，解决政府危机应以遵守宪法和满足劳动群众的要求为根据。意大利总工会书记处通过了一项决议，要求建立准备解决劳动人民一致要求解决的问题的新政府。这些问题包括：土地使用契约的改革，使意大利的石油和其他原料资源不为垄断资本组织所操纵，采取措施以消除某些主要经济部门所遭到的严重危机的原因，实现投资于工业和农业的计划以使绝大部分的失业者立即获得工作等等。
