Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 2nd, TASS dispatch: Newspapers reveal that battles between Colombian government troops and insurgent peasants have not ceased in the past two months. The uprising erupted in the Tolima province, a major coffee-producing center. There, the police, acting on government orders, expelled peasants from their land in order to use the land to build airports, firing ranges, barracks, and other military structures.

    The government's use of air force, tanks, and massive troops to deal with the uprising demonstrates the scale of the peasant revolt. Newspapers also say that field military courts have been established in the uprising area, and hundreds of peasants have been shot.
      “Latin America Today” reports that among those resisting the Colombian government are people from various parties such as the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, and the Communist Party, who have already established a National Liberation Democratic Front.
    "People's Daily" published a statement from the Latin American Labor Federation. The statement pointed out that the Colombian authorities continue to take large-scale military actions to deal with the rebellious peasants in the Tolima and Quindío regions. The statement called on working people around the world to protest against this criminal act.

    哥伦比亚起义农民继续斗争
    据新华社三日讯　据塔斯社纽约二日讯：据报纸透露，哥伦比亚政府军队同起义农民之间的战斗最近两月以来一直没有停止。起义是在咖啡主要出产中心托里马省地区爆发的。那里的警察奉政府的命令驱逐农民离开他们的土地，而把这些土地用来建筑飞机场、打靶场、兵营和其他军事建筑。
    政府用空军、坦克和庞大的部队来对付起义，由此可见农民起义规模之大。报纸还说，在起义地区还设立了野战军事法庭，成百的农民被枪毙。
      “今日拉丁美洲”报道，反抗哥伦比亚政府的人们中，有属于自由党、保守党和共产党等各党派的人，他们已经建成了民族解放民主战线。
    “大众报”刊登了拉丁美洲劳工联盟的声明。声明指出，哥伦比亚当局继续采取大规模的军事行动来对付托里马和昆达依地区暴动的农民。声明号召全世界劳动人民抗议这种罪恶行动。
