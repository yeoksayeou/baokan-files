    The People's School of the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ye County
    Lǐ Zhízhōng
    The Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sichang Township, Ye County, Henan Province, established a people's school in October 1954 based on the demands of its members. This method of "cooperative-run school" solved the contradiction between learning and production.

    The cooperative director, deputy director, committee members, and production team leaders all participated in the learning and took on leadership roles in the study. To make learning a regular activity, the cooperative included learning in the overall production plan. The cooperative cadres were expected to not only lead production well but also lead learning effectively. Inspections of production also included checks on learning, and learning was made an important part of the members' life review meetings. Each production team served as an extracurricular learning unit, with the team leader acting as a learning tutor, in order to seize opportunities during production breaks to lead the team members in their studies.

    Because the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative implemented fixed-time, fixed-quality, and fixed-quantity methods for production and contracted cultivation by season, the work points of each member were recorded by the work recorder after each day's production. This gave the members more time for learning. The cooperative committee meetings held every five days and the members' meetings held twice a month were mostly combined with the weekly political study. In case of special circumstances, the cooperative cadres would discuss and make decisions before the learning session, and then use the time after the learning to convey and deploy these decisions to the members.

    The teaching content was determined based on the cooperative's central work and production needs at each period. In terms of political education, in addition to the fixed political classes twice a week for education on socialism, the worker-peasant alliance, and mutual aid and cooperation, education was also conducted in a timely manner based on the central work of each period and the outstanding ideological problems of the students. For example, last winter, because crops suffered from flooding, the income of cooperative members decreased, and some members lost confidence in the cooperative and their enthusiasm for production was low; the cooperative appropriately increased the time for political classes to conduct education on the socialist future. Last year, although the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative suffered from flooding, the average annual yield per mu was still 327 jin, while the yield of general mutual aid teams and individual farmers was only around 260 jin. After political education and comparison of accounts in connection with reality, the members recognized their erroneous thinking. After the beginning of spring, through political education such as supporting industrialization and supporting the liberation of Taiwan, members were mobilized to invest in expanding reproduction; as a result, more than 350 yuan was raised, enabling the agricultural cooperative to order double-share plows and chemical fertilizers from the supply and marketing cooperative. In terms of production technology education, the people's school was also able to conduct it according to the actual needs of production. For example, last winter, in coordination with the cooperative's manure accumulation campaign, the production teachers explained the high-temperature composting method, the properties and functions of various fertilizers, and how to apply fertilizers rationally. The members understood that manure is acidic and wood ash is alkaline, and mixing them together would reduce the effectiveness of the fertilizer, so they stored the wood ash separately. They recognized that wood ash could help crops grow taller stalks and branches, and each member cherished and preserved the ash from their home stoves, greatly increasing the source of fertilizer. Duan Quansheng's family alone stored more than 500 jin from last winter to this spring. Regarding cultural learning, members were divided into high, middle, and primary classes according to their literacy level.

    The Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative regarded members' learning as a welfare undertaking. The books and paper used by the members were paid for by those who attended school, while the chalk and lamp oil used for teaching were paid for from the cooperative's public welfare fund. In order to organize the women in the cooperative to study, six older women in the cooperative formed a childcare group to take care of the children.

    After the establishment of the people's school in the cooperative, political, production education, and cultural learning became regular. The members reflected: "Participating in the agricultural production cooperative can not only produce more grain and live a prosperous life, but also learn production technology and cultural and scientific knowledge."

Correction: In the article "Why such trust in corrupt elements?" published on page three of this newspaper on June 22nd, the words "can tolerate" in the third to last line of the last paragraph should be deleted.

    叶县红星农业生产合作社的民校
    李执中
    河南叶县思城乡红星农业生产合作社，根据社员们的要求，在一九五四年十月成立了民校。这样“以社办学”，解决了学习和生产的矛盾。
    社长、副社长、社务委员和各生产队长也都参加学习，并担任了学习的领导工作。为了使学习经常化，社内把学习列入整个生产计划。平时要求社干部不仅要把生产领导好，也要把学习领导好；检查生产时，也要检查学习，把学习列为社员生活检讨会的一项重要内容。各生产队就是课外学习单位，由队长任学习辅导员，以便在生产的过程中，抓紧生产空隙具体领导队员进行学习。
    红星农业生产合作社由于生产上实行定时、定质、定量的办法，按季节包耕，平时社员每天的劳动工分由记工员在一天生产后记下来就行了，社员有了更多的学习时间。每五天一次的社务委员会，半月一次的社员大会，多半同每星期的政治学习结合进行。临时有特殊事情，社干部就在学习前研究并作出决议，利用学习后的时间向社员传达和布置。
    教学内容，是根据社内每个时期的中心工作和生产上的需要确定的。政治教育方面，除每星期有固定的两次政治课进行社会主义、工农联盟、互助合作等教育以外，还根据每个时期的中心工作和学员的突出思想问题来及时进行教育。如去冬因为庄稼受水灾，社员收入减少，部分社员对社失去信心，生产积极性不高；社内便适当地增加政治课的时间，进行社会主义前途教育。去年红星农业社虽然遭受水灾，但每亩年产量仍平均在三百二十七斤，一般互助组、单干户的产量只在二百六十斤左右。经过政治教育和联系实际的算账对比，社员们认识了自己的错误思想。入春以后又通过支援工业化、支援解放台湾等政治教育，动员社员投资扩大再生产；结果集中了三百五十多元，使农业社能向供销合作社订购双铧犁和化学肥料。生产技术教育方面，民校也能根据生产实际需要来进行。如去年冬季配合社内积肥运动，生产教员讲解了高温积肥法、各种肥料的性质、作用以及如何合理施肥等。社员懂得大粪是酸性，草木灰是碱性，混杂起来会减低肥料的效能，就把草木灰都单独存放；认识到草木灰可以帮助庄稼长秆长枝，各社员家烧锅出的灰，都珍贵地保藏下来，大大增加了肥料的来源，仅社员段全生一家去冬到今春就贮存了五百多斤。关于文化学习，按社员的识字基础分别编成高、中、初三班进行。
    红星农业生产合作社把社员学习当成一项福利事业。社员用的书籍、纸张，按谁上学谁拿钱的原则；教学用的粉笔、灯油则由社内公益金中开支。为了组织社内妇女学习，又由社内年纪较大的六个妇女组成一个托儿组照顾孩子。
    社内建立了民校以后，政治、生产教育和文化学习都经常了。社员反映：“参加农业生产合作社，不仅可以多打粮食过富裕生活，还能学习生产技术和文化科学知识。”更正六月二十二日本报三版刊登的“为什么对贪污分子这样信任”一文，最后一段倒数第三行中的“能容忍”三字应删去。
