Having read the "People's Daily" exposure of the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we feel boundless indignation! In the past, we always regarded him as a "progressive writer," but we never expected Hu Feng to be such an insidious and vicious counter-revolutionary bandit! While the people of the whole country are working together under the leadership of the Party to build socialism, he and his followers are妄想attempting to overthrow our people's revolutionary regime!

The Hu Feng clique is a group of vipers, and vipers are all-pervading. We recall some things that happened when our "Xinmin Daily" was used by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and now we expose it and demand that Wang Rong, a Hu Feng element who once infiltrated the "Xinmin Daily," confess his conspiracy with Hu Feng and honestly confess his crimes to the people.

I remember that during the Anti-Japanese War, Hu Feng went to Chongqing and asked someone to introduce him to us, expressing his willingness to write for the "Xinmin Daily." At that time, we were dazzled by his Marxist cloak and regarded him as a progressive writer. Since then, he and his cronies published articles in some newspapers in Chongqing, actively promoting their bourgeois idealist literary and artistic ideas, and the Chongqing "Xinmin Daily" was also a newspaper they used. At that time, Hu Feng often interacted with the colleagues of the "Xinmin Daily" editorial department, which was naturally also a means for him to expand his counter-revolutionary clique.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Hu Feng element Wang Rong broke into the Shanghai "Xinmin Daily." At that time, Wang Rong presented himself as a "revolutionary youth," rampaging through the newspaper office and disregarding everyone. We can all recall Wang Rong's "Hu Feng-style" arrogant, conceited, and impetuous attitude. At that time, Wang Rong used his status as a "Xinmin Daily" reporter to solicit articles from Hu Feng elements to promote their reactionary literary and artistic ideas in the "Xinmin Daily." Not long ago, Wang Rong also proposed to the Shanghai "Xinmin Daily" to contract a "current affairs skit column," attempting to turn the Shanghai "Xinmin Daily" into a "supporting small stronghold" of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. Fortunately, the Shanghai "Xinmin Daily" is now under the direct leadership of the Party, and it is not as easy to be fooled as we were in the past, so Wang Rong's conspiracy did not succeed.

After liberation, in 1951, Hu Feng once went to the Beijing "Xinmin Daily" editorial department to give a report to his colleagues, promoting his erroneous literary and artistic ideas. At that time, we not only turned a blind eye to his absurd propaganda within our newspaper office, but also thanked him for his "guidance." Looking back now, we really did not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and even invited the enemy to our home to be a teacher!

Recalling the above events, I am truly ashamed! Due to our own poor theoretical level and low level of awareness, we were used by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements several times without knowing it. At the beginning of the criticism of Hu Feng, we thought it was just a criticism of his literary and artistic ideas. It was not until we read the materials published in the "People's Daily" that we realized in great shock that this was not just a matter of ideological struggle, but a more serious hidden counter-revolutionary conspiracy case. The vipers actually "钻到 (drilled into)" our "肚皮 (belly)"! If we do not resolutely and thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, the revolutionary cause will be harmed. Therefore, we fully support the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to punish the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique according to law. In the future, we must strive to study dialectical materialism under the leadership of the Party, eliminate idealist ideas, and constantly improve our ideological level and strengthen revolutionary vigilance, so that we will not be confused by counter-revolutionary elements disguised as progressives again. This personal experience and lesson is unforgettable.

    毒蛇是无孔不入的
    陈铭德  邓季惺
    看了“人民日报”揭露的胡风反革命集团的罪行，我们感到无比的愤恨！过去，我们一直当他是一个“进步作家”，没料到胡风竟是这样一个阴险狠毒的反革命匪徒！当全国人民在党的领导下齐心努力建设社会主义的时候，他和他的党徒们，竟妄想推翻我们的人民革命政权！
    胡风集团是一群毒蛇，而毒蛇是无孔不入的。我们想起我们所办的“新民报”曾被胡风反革命集团利用的一些事情，现在把它揭露出来，并要求曾经钻到“新民报”的胡风分子王戎交代他和胡风共谋的阴谋活动，老老实实地向人民认罪。
    记得抗日战争时期，胡风到了重庆，就托人介绍和我们认识，他表示愿意为“新民报”写作。当时我们被他的马克思主义外衣所眩惑，把他也当作进步作家看待。此后，他和他的党羽们就在重庆的一些报纸上发表文章，积极宣传他们的资产阶级唯心主义文艺思想，重庆“新民报”也是被他们利用过的一张报纸。当时，胡风还常同“新民报”编辑部的同人们往还，自然也是他扩大他反革命集团的一种手段。
    抗战胜利后，胡风分子王戎打进上海“新民报”。那时王戎以“革命青年”自居，在报社里横冲直撞，目中无人。我们都能回忆起王戎那种“胡风型”的飞扬拔扈、狂妄浮躁的态度。王戎当时就利用“新民报”记者的身份，揽来胡风分子宣传他们反动文艺思想的文章在“新民报”发表。不久前王戎还曾向上海“新民报”提出包干一个“时事小品的专栏”，企图把上海“新民报”作为胡风反革命集团的一个“配合小据点”。幸而现在上海“新民报”是在党直接领导之下，不像我们过去那样容易上当，王戎的阴谋才未得逞。
    解放后，一九五一年，胡风还曾一度到北京“新民报”编辑部向同人作过报告，宣传他那一套错误的文艺思想。我们当时对于他在我们报社内部来进行荒谬宣传，不但熟视无睹，还感谢他的“指教”。现在想起来，我们真是不分敌我，竟把敌人请到自己家里来作老师！
    回想起以上这些事情，真是惭愧！由于我们自己的理论水平差，觉悟程度低，几次被胡风反革命分子利用而不自知。在开始批判胡风的时候，还认为只是批判他的文艺思想。直到看了“人民日报”公布的材料以后，才在十分震惊之下认识到这不仅仅是一个思想斗争的问题，更严重的是一件隐蔽的反革命阴谋案件。毒蛇们竟“钻到”我们“肚皮”里来了。不坚决彻底地粉碎胡风反革命集团，就要使革命事业遭到危害。因此，我们完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，对胡风反革命集团依法治罪。今后，我们一定要在党的领导下努力学习辩证唯物主义，清除唯心主义思想，不断提高自己的思想水平，加强革命警惕性，才不致再被伪装进步的反革命分子所蒙混。这一个亲身经历的经验教训，是永远不能忘记的。
