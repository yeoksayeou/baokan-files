    Accusation Against Hu Feng and Hu Feng Element Ouyang Zhuang for Slander and Poisoning Me
    Li Shihai
    After reading the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily," I could no longer suppress the anger in my heart. I want to accuse Hu Feng and Ouyang Zhuang, a key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary conspiracy group, of slandering and poisoning me. We must thoroughly crush the Hu Feng group and eliminate this batch of counter-revolutionary elements.
    Hu Feng wrote about me in a section called "Li Shihai's Road" in his book "Together with New People," but I never saw Hu Feng come to visit me. In this article, Hu Feng slandered our working class and promoted his fallacies of "subjective fighting spirit" and "self-expansion." In this article, he wrote: "He (referring to me) made a caliper himself, different from any other caliper, which is his unique special tool, and all his creations are more or less realized with this caliper. ... If it is said that manufacturing tools and using tools are the most basic factors for mankind to conquer the objective world, then in Li Shihai's case, we see a more intimate example." Throughout the article, he emphasized the role of one person, as if many of the factory's inventions were all my own achievement. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. Hu Feng's writing completely denies the collectivist spirit of our working class and also denies the leading role of our Party and the working class. I myself know that if it were not for the Party's education that raised my communist consciousness, I could not have achieved anything, let alone that one person with a caliper could "conquer the objective world."
    Ouyang Zhuang, a key member of the Hu Feng group, is a hidden traitor who infiltrated our Party. He once served as the Party branch secretary in our Nanjing Xiaguan Power Plant. Hu Feng tried his best to promote and brag about Ouyang Zhuang in the "Li Shihai's Road" article, saying: "Comrade Ou (referring to Ouyang Zhuang) went to his (referring to me) home to see him once and talked for three or four hours. After that, it was as if he had grabbed the helm, and Li Shihai smoothly exerted his strength to move forward." "What did Li Shihai get from Comrade Ou's conversation? I think it's nothing more than the status of people, trust in work, and the hopes and future of the working class." "A reporter came to visit Comrade Ou and asked him how he cultivated this model worker. Comrade Ou smiled and said, nothing special, just a conversation." Hu Feng and Ouyang Zhuang believe that the Party's cultivation of a model worker is "nothing special, just a conversation." I myself know best that the reason I became a model worker is inseparable from the Party organization's long-term, meticulous, and patient cultivation and the help of many comrades. However, Hu Feng attempted to attribute this achievement entirely to his henchman Ouyang Zhuang, bragging for him. This is a malicious slander with ulterior motives.
    Did the counter-revolutionary element Ouyang Zhuang "cultivate" me? On the contrary. The crimes of this Hu Feng element hidden in the Party are too numerous to record. Here, I will only make accusations and expose the blows and persecution I suffered from him during the two or three years I spent with Ouyang Zhuang in the Xiaguan Power Plant. For example, Hu Feng scolded our Party comrades as "officials" and "masters," while Ouyang Zhuang secretly scolded our Party bureau chief as a "yellow ox," and in front of many people, he scolded me as a "thief," saying that I was "this model worker is useless."
    I also want to accuse Ouyang Zhuang to the people of the whole country: He often took advantage of my absence to steal, open and secretly read "confidential" and "top secret" documents sent by the National People's Congress and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee. Some documents were even opened and read for four or five days before being returned to me. I want to ask Ouyang Zhuang: What was your purpose in stealing these secret documents?
    The most despicable thing is that Ouyang Zhuang shamelessly provoked discord in our family. In front of my two younger brothers who worked in the same factory as me, and in front of my wife and mother-in-law, he said that I was dissatisfied with them, and in front of me, he said that they were wrong. This made my family's relationship discordant for a time, and the brothers did not speak to each other. He wanted to use this method to undermine my morale.
    While I am making accusations to the people of the whole country, I also deeply realize that due to my lack of vigilance, negligence, and carelessness, I was not able to expose the crimes of the counter-revolutionary elements in time. Now that this group of guys has finally been exposed by the people, all the staff of our factory are fighting against the Hu Feng group, and I will actively participate in this struggle. I will never give up until the Hu Feng group is completely eliminated.

    控诉胡风和胡风分子欧阳庄对我的诬蔑和毒害
    李士海
    看到“人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，我压制不住内心的愤怒。我要控诉胡风和胡风反革命阴谋集团的骨干分子欧阳庄对我的诬蔑和毒害。我们必须彻底粉碎胡风集团，把这批反革命分子清除出去。
    胡风在所著“和新人物在一起”一书的“李士海的路”的一段文章中写到过我，可是，我却从没有看见胡风来访问过我。就在这篇文章中，胡风诬蔑了我们工人阶级，宣扬了他的“主观战斗精神”和“自我扩张”的谬论。他在这篇文章中写道：“他（指我）自己制造了一把和任何卡钳不同的卡钳，这是他独有的一个特殊工具，他的一切创造都多多少少要凭着这把卡钳去实现出来的。……如果说，制造工具、使用工具是人类征服客观世界的最基本的因素，那么，在李士海这里，我们就看到了一个更亲切的例子。”在全篇文章里，他强调了我一个人的作用，仿佛厂里许多创造发明都是我一个人的功劳。这是完全不符合事实的。胡风这种写法，完全否认了我们工人阶级的集体主义精神，也否认我们党和工人阶级的领导作用。我自己知道：如果没有党的教育提高了我的共产主义觉悟，我就不可能有一点成就，更谈不到一个人有了一把卡钳就可以“征服客观世界”了。
    胡风集团骨干分子欧阳庄是混进我们党内的暗藏奸细。曾在我们南京下关发电厂担任过党支部书记。胡风就在“李士海的路”一文中，尽力为欧阳庄捧场吹嘘说：“欧同志（指欧阳庄）到他（指我）家里去看了他一次，谈了三、四小时的话，那以后，好像抓着了舵把子一样，李士海就顺利地使出力气来前进了。”“从欧同志底谈话里面，李士海得到了什么呢？我想，总不外是人的地位、工作上的信任、工人阶级底希望和前途吧。”“有一个记者来访问欧同志，问他是怎样把这个劳模培养出来的，欧同志笑了一笑，说，没有什么，不过谈过一次话罢了。”胡风和欧阳庄认为党培养一个劳动模范是“没有什么，不过谈过一次话罢了”，我自己知道得最清楚：我之所以成为模范，是同党组织的长期的、细致的、耐心的培养和许多同志们的帮助分不开的。而胡风却企图把这个功劳完全记在他的爪牙欧阳庄个人的账上，替他吹嘘，这是他们别有用心的诬蔑。
    反革命分子欧阳庄“培养”我了么？恰恰相反。这个暗藏在党内的胡风分子的罪恶是一笔难以写完的。我这里仅就我和欧阳庄在下关发电厂相处的二三年中身受到他的打击和迫害提出控诉和揭发。例如，胡风骂我们党的同志是“官们”“老爷”，欧阳庄则背后骂我们的党员局长是“黄牛”，当着很多人的面骂我是“小偷”，说我“这个劳模没屌用”。
    我还要向全国人民控告欧阳庄：他常利用我外出的机会，偷拆和窃看全国人民代表大会和江苏省人民委员会寄来的“机密”和“绝密”文件，有的文件甚至拆看了四五天才交还给我。我要问欧阳庄：你偷看这些密件的目的何在？
    最卑鄙的是欧阳庄竟无耻地挑拨我们家庭的不和。他在同我在一个厂工作的两个弟弟面前，在我爱人和岳母面前说我对他们不满，又在我面前说他们的不是，弄得我一家人一度感情不和，兄弟间互不讲话。他就想用这种手段来打击我的情绪。
    当我在向全国人民控诉的时候，我也深深体会到由于自己警惕性不高，麻痹大意，没有能够及时揭发反革命分子的罪行。现在这批家伙终被人民揭发出来了，我厂全体职工正在向胡风集团进行斗争，我将积极参加这个斗争。不把胡风集团彻底消灭誓不甘休。
