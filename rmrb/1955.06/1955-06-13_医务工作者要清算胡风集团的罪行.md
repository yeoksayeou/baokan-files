Medical Workers Must Liquidate the Crimes of the Hu Feng Group
Zhong Huilan

I have always been busy with medical work and have never known Hu Feng's name or appearance, nor have I ever read any of his works. When the nationwide criticism of Hu Feng's literary thought began, I thought Hu Feng's problem was probably the same type as Mr. Yu Pingbo's subjective idealist views on the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and that literary work had little to do with me, so I did not fully recognize the importance of this ideological criticism. It was not until I read the "People's Daily" on May 13th and 24th, which successively published the facts about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary evil conspiracies, that I began to realize that the Hu Feng problem was not a simple ideological problem, but a serious political problem. After reading the third batch of materials published in the "People's Daily" on June 10th, I was even more furious and filled with righteous indignation. The facts are all there, fully proving that Hu Feng and his henchmen are an incorrigible anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary special agent group. All Chinese people have the right and obligation to liquidate the crimes of the Hu Feng reactionary group. In order to ensure the smooth progress of our socialist construction and to protect the safety of the motherland and the achievements of the people's revolutionary cause, we medical workers and all natural science workers should, together with the people of the whole country, actively participate in the struggle to denounce the Hu Feng reactionary group and remove this anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiratorial group, which has been wearing a revolutionary cloak and waving the banner of Marxism for many years, from the pure ranks of the people.

Through recent studies, I have realized that this struggle is a serious political struggle. We should work harder to study Marxism, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and learn from the experience and lessons of the Hu Feng conspiracy. Each of us should carefully examine ourselves, educate ourselves, transform ourselves, improve our political vigilance, and resolutely struggle against all disguised revolutionary and hidden elements. We must never tolerate any beastly reactionaries sneaking into the people to undermine our country's great socialist cultural and economic construction.

    医务工作者要清算胡风集团的罪行
    锺惠澜
    我一向忙于医务工作，对于胡风的名字和面貌素不相识，胡风的任何作品都未曾过目。在全国开始批判胡风文艺思想的时候，我还以为胡风的问题大概是和俞平伯先生对于“红楼梦”研究的主观唯心错误看法同一类型的，并且以为文艺工作同我关系不大，因此对于这个思想批判问题的重要性认识不够。一直到阅读了“人民日报”五月十三日和二十四日先后发表关于胡风反动集团的反党反人民反革命的毒恶的阴谋事实以后，才开始认识胡风问题不是个单纯思想问题，乃是一个严重政治问题。我看完了六月十日“人民日报”所发表的第三批材料，更是怒发冲冠，义愤填胸，事实俱在，完全证明了胡风和他的爪牙，是一个怙恶不悛的反党反人民反革命的特务集团。所有中国人民都有权利和义务来清算胡风反动集团的罪行。为了保证我们社会主义建设的顺利进行，为了保护祖国的安全和人民革命事业的成果，我们医务工作者和一切自然科学工作者应该同全国人民一道，积极投入声讨胡风反动集团的斗争，把多年来穿着革命外衣，打着马克思主义旗帜的反党反人民反革命的阴谋集团从纯洁的人民队伍中，清除出去。
    通过近来多次的学习，我认识了这个斗争是一个严重的政治斗争。我们应该更努力地学习马克思主义，展开批评和自我批评，吸取胡风阴谋事件的经验教训。我们每一个人都应该细心检查自己，教育自己，改造自己，提高政治警惕性，对一切伪装革命的暗藏分子进行坚决斗争，绝对不能容忍任何人面兽心的反动分子潜入人民中间来破坏我们祖国伟大的社会主义文化经济建设事业。
