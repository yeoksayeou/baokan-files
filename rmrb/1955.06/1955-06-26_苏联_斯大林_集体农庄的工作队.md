    The Work Team of the "Stalin" Collective Farm in the Soviet Union
    Soviet Union, Fu Ke'erniluofu
    In the first article, we talked about how the "Stalin" Collective Farm in Ryazan Oblast was established and grew, and what achievements it has made so far.

    Now, we would like to introduce to the readers of the People's Daily the labor organization of a field work team in this farm.

    The Stalin Collective Farm has a total of eight work teams: four field work teams, three vegetable growing teams, and one fodder collection team. Each work team has fixed production buildings, draught animals, farm implements, as well as arable land and pastures for its own use.

    A piece of land is usually cultivated by a fixed work team throughout the entire crop rotation period (the crop rotation period is seven to nine years). Each field implementing crop rotation is further divided into several plots. In this way, a work team does not only cultivate a certain crop, but cultivates various crops contained in the rotation field.

    Work teams are formed on a voluntary basis. However, the collective farm management committee should supervise this organization to prevent it from becoming random and to ensure that each work team, as an independent production unit of the collective farm, is capable of handling a large amount of management work. For example, there have been cases in the farm where all those who signed up for one work team were experienced but older members, while those who joined another work team were young, energetic, but not very familiar with agricultural techniques. Some work teams were mostly women, while others were mostly men. In this case, the farm management committee, with the consent of the members, made necessary adjustments to the workforce based on the interests of the work.

    When organizing work teams, the location of the work team's plot and the distance from the members' residences were also taken into account. The "Stalin" Collective Farm includes a total of four villages, which are two to five kilometers apart. Each village has about one hundred and seventy to two hundred people capable of working. In order to prevent the farm members from wasting a lot of time on the way to work in the fields, independent field work teams were established in each village.

    The second field work team, led by Pavel Gusev, a demobilized officer from the Soviet army, has a total of forty-six people. Among them are young and old members, men and women. Some have been working in the farm for decades, while others have just joined the work team after graduating from a seven-year school.

    This work team is allocated two hundred and fifty hectares of arable land and one hundred hectares of hayfields. The work team has several warehouses for storing seeds, a stable, twenty draught horses (plus sixteen ponies) and their vehicles and harnesses, four mowing machines, two grain harvesters, as well as some small farm implements: four horse-drawn hay rakes, thirteen plows, thirteen harrows, and several cultivators. All the property of the work team is fixedly taken care of by certain members, who are responsible for keeping these properties intact.

    Although the main work of the work team, like in the entire farm, is mainly completed by the machines of the machine tractor station, there is still some work to be done by the work team itself, such as harvesting grain in small fields, carrying out cooperative cultivation when machines cannot go to the fields, and so on. The farm implements of the work team are designed for this purpose. These farm implements, draught animals, and transportation vehicles can only be transferred out of the work team with the consent of the work team leader or according to the decision of the farm management committee.

    This work team sows about seventy hectares of winter wheat (rye and wheat) every year, ten hectares each of spring wheat, corn, millet, and Sudan grass for feed, thirty-five hectares of potatoes, and five hectares of root crops. The sown area of perennial grass (clover interspersed with timothy grass) covers about ninety hectares. However, this area will soon be reduced to expand the sown area of corn, a crop with higher yield and more valuable.

    The work team we are talking about is famous for its high level of cultivation. Although the land of the "Stalin" Collective Farm is barren (sandy loam), this work team obtains a good harvest every year: an average of more than twenty quintals of grain per hectare, one hundred and fifty to one hundred and seventy quintals of potatoes, thirty to forty quintals of millet, and so on. Among the members of this work team, twenty-nine members were rewarded by the government with medals and badges for creating the high-yield record of winter wheat in this state – a wheat yield of more than thirty quintals per hectare.

    These achievements are undoubtedly the result of the great efforts of the entire work team, the result of being good at organizing labor and being good at adopting advanced agronomic methods.

    The labor organization of Gusev's work team is no different from other work teams. There was a time when there were several high-yield groups of seven or eight people in the work team. The work team had divided certain plots of land from its own land and allocated them to these groups to cultivate grain and other crops. At that time, these groups also played the role of pioneers of advanced agronomic methods and vanguards of the campaign to strive for high yields. However, with the development of mechanization of field work, the necessity of groups disappeared. This situation of dividing large pieces of land into many small pieces as working plots for groups began to hinder the machine from exerting its high production efficiency. Now, there are no groups in Gusev's field work team. Only in vegetable growing teams and field work teams that need to use a lot of manual labor to cultivate industrial raw material crops are groups retained.

    The work team leader leads all the work of the work team. All members must follow his instructions. The work team leader is responsible for calculating the daily labor results. He is fully responsible for the correct allocation of personnel in the team and the quality of the team's work.

    The daily work scope of the work team is very wide. All members are working according to the work plan formulated by the work team leader for a certain work period (spring sowing, field management, harvesting, etc.). In addition, the work team leader must be able to foresee all possible unexpected events and rearrange the work in progress when necessary.

    "The arrangement for the next working day," said work team leader Pavel Gusev, "I must plan in advance the night before. I usually sit down and write down the work that needs to be done first in my notebook. These notes are a special kind of plan, a memorandum. You see, these are the notes: 'In order to use airplanes to topdress the grassland, the work team must collect two hundred quintals of fertilizer by itself'; 'Spring wheat should be vernalized'; 'Tasks should be assigned to sowing hands', and so on."

    We asked the work team leader how to allocate manpower tomorrow. The team leader replied: "You see, now is the busy season for preparing for sowing. In this case, the allocation of manpower tomorrow will be like this. Seven people will serve the plane - two people will transport fertilizer, three people will load fertilizer onto the plane, and the other two people will use small flags to indicate the boundary for spreading fertilizer in the field. Two people will screen and grind fertilizer. Two people will mix seeds. Two sowing hands will take care of the seeder pulled by the tractor, and three drivers will be sent to transport seeds. Ten people will transport manure and apply base fertilizer to the spring wheat field; then immediately use a tractor to carry out a plowing on the spring wheat field. Two people will use horses to transport water and fuel for the tractor."

    We know from the conversation with the work team leader that he has calculated everyone in his team and planned every working hour.

    While we were talking, the farm chairman Ivan Nazarov called. He asked the work team to allocate a person to go to the orchard for one or two days of urgent work. The work team leader thought for a moment. All his people have been assigned and are busy. However, he came up with a solution. He consulted with the farm members who were assigned to work by the plane. How about trying our best to use two people to load fertilizer onto the plane instead of three? The farm members said that the plane only lands for six minutes at a time, and the loading work must be completed within two minutes. The work is very heavy. However, due to the urgent task of the orchard, they finally agreed to do the work most intensively, so that one person can be spared to do the urgent work of the orchard. The work team leader said that it is impossible not to do this. Since it is needed, we should help. When it is a busy season, everyone will also help us. Only in this way, "one for all, all for one", can we complete the work task.

    Pavel Gusev also mentioned that he is going to hold a short "meeting" tomorrow. At this short gathering, he will talk to the members about the summary of the spring sowing competition of each work team, inform them that the first work team has won the championship, and decide with them how to learn from the first work team. It should be known that the "brief report" will be published tomorrow, publishing the summary of the competition within the work team, and publishing the list of advanced workers in transporting manure, excellent sowing hands and drivers.

    The members have been studying in agronomy training classes throughout the winter. Now, the field work has begun to be busy, and the study has not yet ended. It is particularly busy to carry out study and work at the same time. But study is very necessary. The day after tomorrow, some sowing hands will study the new corn square-hole planter that has just been transported to the farm. The work team leader is prepared to personally supervise the learning of the new machine. It is decided to conduct practice lessons similar to general exercises directly in the field. The work team leader finally said that only after such study can we be sure to carry out sowing uninterruptedly and accurately.

    Gusev's work team has a very important characteristic: every member of the work team can replace others to engage in any other kind of work at the necessary moment - the operator of the threshing machine does the work of the plowman, the plowman does the work of the sowing hand, and the driver does the work of the farm implement hand. Of course, this does not affect the work team having thirteen fixed drivers, two farm implement hands who work fixedly in the tractor work team, and three grooms who take care of the horses. Because this work team has such a characteristic, when someone is sick or cannot go to work for other legitimate reasons, the work will not be stopped, and a substitute can always be found. This is the result of tenacious study and a lot of practical work experience.

    The unity and mutual assistance between comrades is a characteristic of the second work team.

    Sometimes it happens that some farm members do not have time to collect all the hay together at the end of the working day, or stack the harvested grain. If at this time dark clouds gather and the farm property is in danger of being rained on, then the entire work team will help. People never take into account fatigue and time. During the busy season of harvesting, the members of the work team forget personal matters; they do not get enough sleep - but all the work must be completed on time and with excellent quality.

    Gusev's work team is one of the first work teams in the state to adopt advanced agronomic methods in the field, these advanced agronomic methods are: wheat cross-sowing method, potato square-hole sowing method, two spring topdressings of autumn-sown grains with a mixed fertilizer of mineral fertilizer and ash, fertilization of natural grasslands with mineral fertilizers from airplanes, and so on.

    Every winter, the work team transports at least twenty to twenty-five tons of manure and peat compost per hectare to prepare the fields for planting spring crops. All these ensure high and stable harvests, thereby improving the farm's economy and the welfare of the members.

    苏联“斯大林”集体农庄的工作队
    苏联  甫·柯尔尼洛夫
    在第一篇文章里，我们曾谈到梁赞州的“斯大林”集体农庄是怎样建立、怎样成长的，以及目前它已有了哪些成绩。
    现在，我们向人民日报的读者来介绍这个农庄的一个田间工作队的劳动组织。
    斯大林集体农庄共有八个工作队：四个田间工作队，三个蔬菜种植队，一个饲料采集队。每个工作队都有固定使用的生产建筑物、役畜、农具以及耕地和牧场。
    一块土地，通常在整个轮种时期中（轮种期是七年到九年）都固定由一个工作队负责耕种。每块实行轮作的田又分成若干地段。这样，一个工作队便不是只作育某一种作物，而是作育在轮作田中所包含的各种作物。
    工作队是按自愿原则编成的。但是集体农庄管理委员会应进行监督，使这种组编工作不致陷于自流，使作为集体农庄独立生产单位的每个工作队能够胜任大量的经营工作。例如，农庄也曾出现过这种情形：报名加入一个工作队的全是一些有经验，但却上了年纪的庄员，相反地，加入另一个工作队的则是一些年轻、精力饱满、但却不很熟悉农业技术的人。一些工作队大半是妇女，而另一些则大半是男子。在这种情况下，农庄管理委员会曾征得庄员们的同意，根据工作的利益，对人力进行了必要的调配。
    在组织工作队时，也考虑到了工作队地段的位置和队员居住地的距离。“斯大林”集体农庄一共包括四个村子，村和村之间相距二到五公里。每个村子约有一百七十到二百个有劳动能力的人。为了使农庄庄员在去田间工作的途中不致浪费很多时间，每个村都建立了独立的田间工作队。
    由苏联军队的一位复员军官帕维尔·古谢夫领导的第二田间工作队，共有四十六人。其中有年轻的庄员，也有年纪大的庄员，有男子也有妇女。一些人已在农庄里连续工作了几十年，另一些人是从七年制学校毕业后刚参加工作队的。
    这个工作队被分配了二百五十公顷耕地和一百公顷刈草场。工作队拥有供自己使用的几个储藏种籽的仓库，一个马厩，二十匹役马（另有十六匹小马）及它们所驾的车辆和挽具，四部割草机，两部收获谷物用的收割机，此外还有一些小型农具：四部马拉搂草器、十三部犁、十三部耙和几部中耕机。工作队的全部财产都固定由某些队员照管，他们负有完整地保管这些财产的责任。
    虽然工作队的主要工作，正像在整个农庄一样，主要是用机器拖拉机站的机器来完成，但是仍然有一部分工作要靠工作队自己来做，如在小块田地上收割谷物，在机器还不能开往田中的时候进行配合耕作以及其他等等。工作队的农具就是为这个目的而设的。这些农具、役畜、运输工具只有经过工作队长的同意或根据农庄管理委员会的决议，才能调到工作队外去使用。
    这个工作队每年播种冬麦（黑麦和小麦）约七十公顷，春麦、玉蜀黍、黍、作饲料用的苏丹草各十公顷，马铃薯三十五公顷，块根作物五公顷。多年生草（三叶草间播以猫尾草）的播种面积约占地九十公顷。但是，这个面积最近即要缩减，以扩大玉蜀黍这一具有更高产量和更珍贵的作物的播种面积。
    我们谈的这个工作队，是以高度耕作水平出名的。虽然“斯大林”集体农庄的土地贫瘠（砂壤土），但是这个工作队每年都获得丰收：谷物每公顷平均收二十多公担，马铃薯——一百五十到一百七十公担，黍——三十到四十公担，以及其他等等。在这个工作队的队员中，有二十九名庄员由于创造了本州冬小麦的丰产纪录——每公顷小麦收获量超过了三十公担，而得到了政府的奖励——勋章和奖章。
    这些成绩无疑地是整个工作队巨大努力的结果，是善于组织劳动和善于采用先进农艺方法的结果。
    古谢夫的工作队的劳动组织，和其他工作队并没有什么不同。有一个时期，工作队里曾有过几个由七、八人组成的丰收小组。工作队曾由自己的土地中划出一定的几个地段分配给这几个小组来作育谷物和其他作物。当时，这些小组也起过先进农艺方法的倡导者、争取丰收运动的特别突击队的前导者的作用。但是，随着田间工作机械化的发展，小组的必要性消失了。这种把一些大块的田地割裂成许多小块作为小组工作地段的情况，开始妨碍机器去发挥它的高度生产效率。现在，在古谢夫的田间工作队里已经没有小组。只有在蔬菜种植队和需要使用大量手工劳动来作育工业原料作物的田间工作队里才保留着小组。
    工作队队长领导工作队的全部工作。全体队员都必须执行他的指示。工作队长要计算每天的劳动成果。他对队内人员的正确调配，对队内工作的好坏，负完全责任。
    工作队的日常工作范围很广。全体队员都是按照工作队长在一定工作时期（春播，田间管理，收获以及其他等等）所制定的工作计划而进行劳动的。此外，工作队长要能预见一切可能发生的意外事件，并于必要时把进行中的工作加以重新布置。
      “对下一个工作日的安排，”工作队长帕维尔·古谢夫说，“我必须及时地在头天晚上就计划好。我通常是要坐下来把首先要做的工作记在笔记本上。这些记事是一种特殊的计划，是一种备忘录。你看，这就是这些记事：‘为了用飞机在草地上进行追肥，工作队要自己运集二百公担的肥料’；
  ‘要进行春麦的春化处理’；‘要为播种手布置任务’等等。”
    我们问工作队长，明天怎样配置人力。队长回答说：“你看，现在正是准备播种的繁忙时节。在这种情况下，明天人力的配备将是这样的。七个人为飞机服务——两个人运肥料，三个人把肥料装上飞机，另外两个人用小旗子指示向田间撒肥的界限。两个人去筛选和磨碎肥料。两个人拌种。两个播种手去照管拖拉机牵引的播种机，另派三名驭手去运送种籽。十个人去给春麦地运厩肥和施底肥；然后立刻用拖拉机在春麦地上进行一次犁耕。两个人用马为拖拉机运送水和燃料。”
    我们从工作队长的谈话里知道，他对自己的每个人都计算到了，对每一个工时都作了计划。
    正在我们谈话时，农庄主席伊凡·纳札罗夫来了电话。他要求工作队分出一个人到果园中去干一两天的紧急活。工作队长考虑了一下。他所有的人都已分配好了，都在忙着。但是，他想出了办法。他找被派往飞机旁工作的农庄庄员们商量。如果尽力想办法，不要用三个人，而用两个人往飞机上装肥料怎么样呢？农庄庄员们说，飞机着陆的时间一共只有六分钟，在两分钟内就得完成装载工作。工作很繁重。但是，由于提到果园的紧急任务，他们终于同意最紧张地来做好这项工作，这样就能腾出一个人去做果园的紧急工作。工作队长说，不这样也是不行的。既然需要，我们就应当去帮忙。碰到繁忙的时节，大家也来帮我们。只有这样“一人为大家，大家为一人”，我们才能完成工作任务。
    帕维尔·古谢夫也谈到，他预备明天举行一次简短的“碰头会”。在这次简短的集会上，他将向队员们谈谈各工作队的春播竞赛总结，通知他们第一工作队已赢得了冠军，并同他们一道来决定应当怎样向第一工作队学习。要知道，明天就要出
  “快报”，发表工作队队内的竞赛总结，发表运送厩肥的先进工作者、优秀的播种手和驭手的名单。
    庄员们整个冬季都在农艺训练班中学习。现在，田间工作开始忙起来了，学习又还没有结束，同时要进行学习和工作就显得特别忙起来了。但是学习是非常必要的。后天，一些播种手就要研究刚刚运到农庄来的新的玉蜀黍正方穴播机。工作队长预备亲自监督对新机器的学习情况。决定直接在田间进行类似总演习的练习课。工作队长最后说，只有经过这样的学习，才能有把握来不间断地和精确地进行播种。
    古谢夫的工作队有一个极重要的特点：工作队的每个队员在必要的时刻都能代替别人从事任何其他一种工作——打谷机的操使手做耕田者的工作，耕田者做播种手的工作，驭手做农具手的工作。当然，这并不影响工作队拥有十三名固定的驭手，两名固定在拖拉机工作队中工作的农具手和三名照看马匹的马夫。因为这个工作队有这样一个特点，当有人生病或因别的正当理由而不能上工时，工作并不会停顿下来，代替的人永远可以找到。这是顽强的学习和大量的实际工作经验的结果。
    队员的团结一致，同志间的真诚互助，是第二工作队的特色。
    有时也发生这样的情况，即某一些农庄庄员在劳动日终了时，没有来得及把所有的干草收集到一起，或是垛好收割下来的谷物。如果这时乌云密集，农庄财产有受到雨淋的危险，那末整个工作队都会来帮忙。人们从不顾及疲劳和时间。在收获的繁忙时期，工作队的队员们忘记了个人的私事；他们睡眠不足——但所有的工作都要按时完成，并且质量优良。
  古谢夫工作队是本州最先在田中采用先进农艺方法的工作队之一，这些先进农艺方法是：小麦交叉播种法，马铃薯正方穴播法，用矿质肥料和灰分的混合肥料对秋播谷物进行两次春季追肥，从飞机上用矿质肥料对天然草场进行施肥以及其他等等。
    工作队每年冬天都要为预备种春季作物的田地，每公顷至少运去二十到二十五吨的厩肥和泥炭堆肥。所有这些都保证了取得高额的稳定收成，从而提高农庄的经济和庄员们的福利。
