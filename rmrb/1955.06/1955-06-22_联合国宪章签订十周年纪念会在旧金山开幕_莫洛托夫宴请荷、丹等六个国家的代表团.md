San Francisco Mayor Robinson and California Governor Knight welcomed the delegates.

UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld gave a brief congratulatory speech, in which he spoke of the important responsibilities entrusted to the United Nations by the people of the world. He mentioned some recent international events that have led to some easing of international tensions: the Bandung Asian-African Conference, the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty, and the preparations for the Four-Power Summit Conference. Hammarskjöld emphasized that all these events "give new hope" for further consolidating world peace and security.

UN Commemoration Chairman Van Kleffens then spoke, drawing the delegates' attention to the great international significance of this commemoration. He said that the people of the world expect this commemoration to "make an important contribution to improving the international atmosphere."

After Van Kleffens' speech, the opening ceremony of the UN Commemoration ended. The commemoration will continue on the 21st.
