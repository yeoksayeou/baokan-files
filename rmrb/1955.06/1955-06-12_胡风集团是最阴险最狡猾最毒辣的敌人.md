The "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group on June 10th. I felt extremely indignant after reading it. From the materials revealed in the newspaper, we can clearly see the true face of the Hu Feng group. It turns out that the backbone of the Hu Feng group are elements such as imperialist Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary military officers, Trotskyites, and revolutionary traitors. They had close ties with Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau and other secret service organs very early on. Hu Feng has consistently engaged in anti-Party and anti-people activities for the past twenty years. After the national liberation, they even more frantically attacked the Party and the people, everywhere
  “pioneering work,” establishing strongholds, attempting to lay a “foundation,” and lying dormant for a long time. They also pretended to be progressive, "burying themselves in work," while also wanting to penetrate into the "liver," to prevent "unexpected blows." They infiltrated our various organs in this way, even infiltrating the interior of the Chinese Communist Party. The Hu Feng group colluded with Chiang Kai-shek from within and without; they were "full of optimism" about Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale attack on the people in 1946 and believed that it was necessary to resolutely "go all the way."

The Hu Feng group slanders and hates the new China where the people are the masters, dreaming of the "destruction" of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's revolutionary regime. They even slanderously attacked many revolutionaries and democratic figures such as Lu Xun, Wen Yiduo, Guo Moruo, and Mao Dun, opposing them; portraying the revolutionary forces led by the Chinese Communist Party as "withered leaves" and "rotten corpses." They are the commando of the dying Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

The Hu Feng group is doing the same anti-people deeds as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Can we still tolerate such a frantically resolute counter-revolutionary element like Hu Feng? Now that the evidence is conclusive, they should be punished according to the law immediately.

The crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group have been fully exposed. The facts prove that Hu Feng's problem is not a theoretical issue, let alone a general political issue, and certainly not a literary and ideological issue. Therefore, the struggle to crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is not only a matter for the literary and art circles, but for the people of the whole country. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Liaoning Province must take active action, unite around the Chinese Communist Party, and resolutely expose and smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. We must learn from the lessons of this struggle, strengthen our study of Marxist theory in the future, improve our ideological level, heighten our vigilance, and draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy. We must resolutely expose and attack all hidden elements who pretend to be revolutionary but actually oppose the revolution.

Finally, we want to warn the Hu Feng elements that they must thoroughly confess, expose Hu Feng, criticize themselves, and start anew. Those who have been influenced by the Hu Feng group should also consciously examine themselves, conduct criticism, and draw a clear line.

    胡风集团是最阴险最狡猾最毒辣的敌人
    宁武
    六月十日“人民日报”发表了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料。我看完以后非常愤恨。我们从报纸所揭露的材料可以清楚地看出胡风集团的真实面目，原来胡风集团的骨干是些帝国主义国民党特务分子、反动军官、托洛茨基分子和革命叛徒，他们在很早以前就和国民党中统等特务机关有密切联系。胡风二十年来一贯地进行反党、反人民的活动，全国解放以后，更疯狂地向党向人民进攻，到处
  “开辟工作”，建立据点，企图打下“基础”，长期埋伏；他们还伪装进步，“埋头工作”，同时要深入到“肝脏里面去”，以防“碰上一些意想不到的打击”。他们就是这样混入到我们各种机关里，甚至混进中国共产党的内部。胡风集团和蒋介石里应外合，他们对蒋介石在一九四六年向人民的大规模进攻“充满了乐观”，并且认为必须坚决地“一不作，二不休”。
    胡风集团污蔑仇恨人民当家的新中国，梦想中国共产党和人民革命政权的“灭亡”。他们甚至对鲁迅、闻一多、郭沫若、茅盾等许多革命者和民主人士大肆污蔑，反对他们；把中国共产党领导的革命力量说成是“枯黄的叶子”、“腐朽的尸体”，他们是垂死的蒋介石匪帮的别动队。
    胡风集团同蒋介石匪帮一模一样干着反人民的勾当，像胡风这样丧心病狂的坚决反革命分子，我们还能容忍吗？现在证据已经确凿，应立即依法惩办。
    胡风反革命集团的罪行已昭然若揭，事实证明胡风的问题已不是什么理论问题，更不是一般政治问题，当然更不是一个文艺思想问题了。所以，粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争也不仅是文艺界的事，而是全国人民的事。我们中国国民党革命委员会在辽宁省的同志要积极行动起来，团结在中国共产党的周围，坚决地揭发、粉碎胡风反革命集团。我们要在这次斗争中，吸取教训，今后必须加强马克思主义理论学习，提高思想水平，提高警惕，划清敌我界限。对于一切伪装革命而实际反对革命的暗藏分子，必须予以坚决的揭发和打击。
    最后我们要警告胡风分子，必须彻底交代，揭露胡风，批判自己，重新作人，受过胡风集团影响的人，也应自觉地检查自己，开展批评，划清界限。
