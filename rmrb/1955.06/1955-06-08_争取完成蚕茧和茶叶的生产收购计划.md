    Strive to Complete the Production and Procurement Plans for Silkworm Cocoons and Tea
    Luo Baoyi
    Last winter and this spring, many silkworm cocoon and tea producing areas suffered from frost disasters, and mulberry and tea trees were damaged to varying degrees. This year's spring silkworms and spring tea may be reduced. This situation should attract everyone's attention. If the production increase plans for silkworm cocoons and tea cannot be realized, it will not only make the arrangement of domestic sales of silk and tea more difficult, but also directly affect the completion of silk and tea export plans. The leading organs of the silkworm cocoon and tea producing areas must seize the opportunity and take all effective measures to strive for the realization of this year's silkworm cocoon and tea production and procurement plans.
    In terms of silkworm cocoon production, it is necessary to make full use of the production season, strengthen technical guidance to mutual aid and cooperative organizations and individual farmers who raise silkworms, and strive to improve the yield and quality of spring silkworm cocoons. During the silkworm rearing period, it is necessary to keep abreast of the mulberry leaf situation, do a good job in mulberry leaf regulation, strengthen the market management of mulberry leaves, and ensure that spring silkworms have sufficient feed. After the spring cocoons are harvested, efforts should be made to expand the number of summer silkworm eggs and autumn silkworm eggs distributed. All areas with conditions for raising summer and autumn silkworms should distribute as many silkworm eggs as possible to increase the output of summer and autumn silkworm cocoons. After the spring silkworm rearing is over, farmers should be mobilized to topdress the mulberry gardens and catch mulberry weevils to increase mulberry leaf production and ensure the rearing of summer and autumn silkworms. Raising tussah silkworms is also an important aspect of increasing silk production. Tussah silkworm producing areas such as Henan and Shandong provinces should mobilize farmers to actively manage tussah forests, expand the area for releasing tussah silkworms, and strive for a bumper harvest of tussah silkworms.
    Fully tapping the potential in tea production and striving to increase the production of summer tea is a serious task in this year's tea production. The normal output of summer tea generally accounts for 25 to 30 percent of the total annual output. After the spring tea harvest, tea farmers must be organized to carry out a tea garden cultivation and weeding, and apply topdressing fertilizer to tea trees. The summer tea production season is short and coincides with the busy farming season, so it is necessary to pay attention to guiding tea farmers to rationally allocate labor and overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor. In the production and procurement of spring tea and summer tea, in addition to ensuring the quality of tea for export, the picking standards for domestic fine tea can be appropriately relaxed to increase the output of domestic tea, so as to squeeze out a part of domestic fine tea to supplement the shortage of tea for export.
    According to the situation of tea and silkworm production this year, to complete this year's procurement tasks for tea and silkworm cocoons, arduous efforts must be made. This year, the procurement scope of silkworm cocoons and tea must be expanded. It is necessary not only to strengthen the procurement work in the main producing areas, but also to actively carry out the procurement of products and inferior products in scattered producing areas by using rural small merchants and peddlers as purchasing agents. That is to say, in addition to actively purchasing the originally designated specifications of cocoons and tea, for native silk, waste silk, native silk by-products, and tender branches and old leaves of tea trees, wild tea, etc., procurement can be carried out according to the principle of same quality and same quantity, and pricing according to quality. In some scattered cocoon-producing areas, the procurement price should be appropriately taken care of in consideration of production costs, without affecting the prices in the main producing areas. The procurement price should be drafted by the local procurement department and implemented after being approved by the local financial and economic leading organs. According to preliminary investigations in various places, Sichuan, Yunnan, Xikang, Guizhou, Hunan and other provinces have a large number of barren tea gardens. If farmers can be actively organized to pick and make barren tea and wild tea, it is estimated that tens of thousands of dan can be purchased this year. In today's situation of insufficient domestic tea supply, advocating drinking coarse tea will be supported by the masses. Expanding the scope of cocoon and tea procurement is also beneficial to farmers.

    争取完成蚕茧和茶叶的生产收购计划
    罗抱一
    去冬今春不少蚕茧、茶叶产区发生冻灾，桑树、茶树受到一定损害，今年的春蚕和春茶可能减产。这种情况要引起大家的注意。如果蚕茧和茶叶增产计划不能实现，那末，不但会使内销丝、茶的安排增加困难，而且会直接影响丝、茶出口计划的完成。各蚕茧、茶叶产区的领导机关必须抓紧时机，采取一切有效的措施，力争今年蚕茧、茶叶生产和收购计划的实现。
    在蚕茧生产方面，必须充分利用生产季节，加强对养蚕的互助合作组织和个体农民的技术指导，努力提高春蚕蚕茧的产量和质量。在养蚕期间，要及时掌握桑叶情况，做好桑叶调剂工作，加强桑叶的市场管理，保证春蚕有足够的饲料。春茧收获以后，应努力扩大夏蚕种和秋蚕种的发放数量，凡是具有饲育夏蚕秋蚕条件的地区，都应该尽可能多多发放蚕种，以便增加夏蚕秋蚕茧产量。在春蚕饲养结束以后，应动员农民进行桑园追肥，捕除桑蟥，增产桑叶，保证养好夏蚕秋蚕。多养柞蚕也是增加蚕丝生产的一个重要方面。河南、山东等柞蚕产区应动员农民积极整理柞林，扩大柞蚕放养面积，争取柞蚕丰收。
    充分发掘茶叶生产中的潜力，努力增产夏茶，是今年茶叶生产方面的严重任务。夏茶的正常产量一般占全年产量的百分之二十五至三十。在春茶收获后，必须组织茶农进行一次茶园中耕除草，给茶树增施追肥。夏茶生产季节短，而且正值农忙时期，必须注意领导茶农合理调配劳力，克服劳力不足的困难。在春茶夏茶的生产和收购方面，除了保证外销茶叶的品质以外，可适当放宽内销细茶的采摘标准，增加内销茶叶的产量，以便挤出一部分内销细茶补充外销茶叶的不足。
    根据今年茶叶、蚕桑生产的情况，要完成今年茶叶、蚕茧的收购任务，必须作艰巨的努力。今年蚕茧、茶叶的收购面必须扩大，不仅要加强主要产区的收购工作，而且要通过利用农村小商小贩代购等方式，积极开展零星产区的产品和次等产品的收购工作。这就是说，除了积极收购原定的几种规格的茧、茶外，对于土丝、下脚丝、土丝副产品和茶树的嫩枝老叶、荒茶、野茶等，都可根据同质同量、按质论价的原则进行收购。在某些零星产茧地区，应在不影响主要产区价格的条件下，适当地照顾生产成本，由各地收购部门拟出收购价格，经当地财经领导机关批准执行。据各地初步调查，四川、云南、西康、贵州、湖南等省都有大量荒芜茶园，如能积极组织农民采制荒茶、野茶，估计今年就可收购数万担。在今天内销茶叶供应不足的情况下，提倡喝点粗茶，是会得到广大群众的支持的。扩大茧、茶的收购范围，对于农民也是有利的。
