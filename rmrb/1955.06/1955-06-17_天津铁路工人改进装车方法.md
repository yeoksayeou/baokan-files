Tianjin Railway workers improve loading methods

    Tianjin Railway Bureau Tianjin Transportation Branch's loading workers are constantly improving loading methods. From February to May of this year, they saved a total of 1,072 train cars. Using these train cars, they transported an additional 26,000 tons of materials. Tianjin is the largest light industrial city in northern China, and daily necessities account for about 70% of the Tianjin Transportation Branch's total transport volume. Targeting the characteristics of daily necessities being light in weight and large in area, the loading workers implemented a close-packing method, which allowed the load capacity of more than 20 kinds of goods to exceed the target. In April and May of this year, the loading workers used a method of loading light and heavy goods together, transporting goods that originally required 91 train cars with only 45 train cars.

    天津铁路工人改进装车方法
    天津铁路管理局天津运输分局装车工人们不断改进装车方法，从今年二月到五月共节省了一千零七十二个车皮。利用这些车皮多运出二万六千吨物资。天津是我国北方最大的轻工业城市，日用百货的运输占天津运输分局总运量的百分之七十左右。装车工人们针对日用百货体轻面积大的特点，实行了紧密装车法，使二十多种货物的装载量超过了指标。今年四五月份，装车工人们又用轻重货物搭配装车的办法，把原来需要九十一个车皮运输的货物用四十五个车皮就装运出去了。（据新华社讯）
