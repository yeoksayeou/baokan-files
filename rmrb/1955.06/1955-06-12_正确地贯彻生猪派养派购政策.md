    Correctly Implement the Hog Assigned Raising and Assigned Purchase Policy
    Chen Jingzhi
    Hog assigned raising and assigned purchase is an important measure taken by the state to develop hog production in a planned way and to strengthen the planning of hog purchase and sales. China's hog production has developed every year, but due to the rapid improvement of the material life of urban and rural people, the growth rate of commercial hog production still cannot keep up with the growth rate of consumption needs. At present, there is a great deal of decentralization and blindness in hog production, which makes it impossible for the state to arrange hog production and sales in a planned way, and farmers cannot arrange production with certainty. This is the main reason why current hog production cannot keep up with the growth in demand. In order to strengthen the combination of hog production and sales, and to ensure a more reliable source of commercial hogs, the state has decided to gradually implement the method of hog assigned raising and assigned purchase with emphasis. The specific approach is: each province and city determines the areas where hog assigned raising and assigned purchase will be implemented based on the state's planned targets and the province's hog production and sales situation, and assigns the assigned raising and assigned purchase tasks to the township level, and then the township specifically assigns them to farmers or agricultural production cooperatives, and the state-owned commercial departments sign contracts with the township people's committees. Farmers sell fattened hogs on time in accordance with the contract; the state-owned commercial departments purchase them at reasonable prices stipulated by the state. After the implementation of this method, in the areas where assigned raising and assigned purchase are implemented, farmers' hog raising production can be closely combined with the state plan, and the state can develop hog production in a planned and focused manner based on production conditions and consumption needs, to ensure the supply of pork to cities and industrial and mining areas and the source of pork for export, and to adjust the regional and seasonal imbalances in pork supply. Farmers who accept the assigned raising and assigned purchase tasks can also know in advance how many fattened hogs they will sell to the state each year and when they will be sold, which also facilitates the arrangement of their own production.
    In the fourth quarter of 1954 and the first quarter of this year, pilot projects for hog assigned raising and assigned purchase were carried out in key areas. Now, the hog raising industry in the areas where hog assigned raising and assigned purchase are implemented has begun to develop. Before December last year, Dazhuguo Township, Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, only raised 305 hogs, and the number of hog raising households was less than one-tenth of the total number of households in the township; after the trial implementation of hog assigned raising and assigned purchase, from December last year to the end of February this year, the number of hog raising households has increased from 86 to 206, raising a total of 471 hogs (not including the 168 fattened hogs sold and slaughtered by farmers during this period). After the trial implementation of hog assigned raising and assigned purchase in Lan'ni Village, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, the number of hogs raised increased by 51% in one month. Hog raising households in areas where assigned raising and assigned purchase are being piloted reflect: "This method is very good, not only is the state's purchase task guaranteed, but we can also eat more meat; raising more hogs and accumulating more manure fertilizer can also increase grain production."
    Hog assigned raising and assigned purchase is a new and complex economic task. To complete this task, it is necessary to carry out sufficient publicity, organization, and correct implementation of the hog assigned raising and assigned purchase policy.
    The work of hog assigned raising and assigned purchase must be promoted in a planned and focused manner based on the needs of the state and the possibilities of production. At present, the focus of implementing assigned raising and assigned purchase should be placed on rural areas near large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas, areas with convenient transportation and major grain-producing areas, areas where feed problems are easier to solve, areas where agricultural production urgently needs a large amount of manure fertilizer, and areas where hog raising has been less in the past but has development prospects. Promoting hog assigned raising and assigned purchase in these areas is of great significance for ensuring the needs of the people in cities and industrial and mining areas and exports, as well as reducing long-distance allocation, transportation, and losses. The planned targets for hog assigned raising and assigned purchase must be determined based on the needs of the state and the people and the spirit of actively exploring the potential of hog production. It is necessary to prevent both the practice of one-sidedly emphasizing difficulties, ignoring production potential, and disregarding the needs of the state, and setting the plan too small, and also to prevent the tendency of blindly developing without considering the actual situation of the local area. When determining the targets of hog assigned raising and assigned purchase, the principle of attaching equal importance to individual farmers and organized production units should be grasped. In addition to assigning assigned raising and assigned purchase tasks to agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers, state-owned farms, state-owned and private sugar factories, wineries, food processing factories, etc. should also be given certain assigned raising and assigned purchase tasks based on possible conditions. Certain collective food units such as government agencies, organizations, and schools that have hog raising conditions can also be given certain assigned raising tasks (without assigned purchase) in order to reduce the burden on the state's supply, but these units should pay attention to avoiding the phenomenon of wasting grain in hog raising.
    Solving the feed problem is one of the keys to developing hog production at present. In the areas where hog assigned raising and assigned purchase are implemented, it is necessary to help farmers increase the source of feed as much as possible. The party and government leading organs and agricultural departments in these areas should, in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's resolution on spring plowing production, mobilize farmers to plant sweet potatoes, melons, vegetables, and other feed crops in a planned way using vacant land, idle land, and abandoned land to expand feed production. In addition, it is also necessary to determine and promote alternative feeds such as wild plants and by-products of crops based on scientific analysis and experiments; the good experiences of the masses in using alternative feeds must be valued. At present, some rural workers and farmers believe that hog raising can only be developed after the problem of greatly increasing grain feed production is fundamentally solved. This erroneous understanding must be corrected, because it will hinder the enthusiasm of the broad masses to increase the source of feed from all aspects. But on the other hand, it is also necessary to prevent the erroneous practice of one-sidedly emphasizing feeding only green feed and coarse feed, while neglecting to help farmers solve the problem of necessary grain feed. We must not only mobilize the masses to plant high-yield feed crops and promote alternative feeds, but also seriously solve the problem of fine feed (including cake feed) necessary for farmers to raise hogs in the unified purchase and sale of grain.
    In the areas where hog assigned raising and assigned purchase are promoted, special attention should also be paid to strengthening the prevention and control of hog epidemics. Agricultural departments must vigorously strengthen the leadership of hog epidemic prevention and control work in hog assigned raising and assigned purchase areas, set up livestock epidemic prevention stations in key hog producing areas, provide epidemic prevention drugs in a timely manner, train and train veterinary personnel in rural areas, summarize and disseminate the experience of the masses in preventing and controlling hog epidemics, and teach the masses epidemic prevention knowledge. State-owned food companies should also vigorously assist agricultural departments in doing a good job in hog epidemic prevention and control, and do everything possible to prevent the occurrence and spread of hog epidemics.
    In the areas where hog assigned raising and assigned purchase are promoted, it is necessary to advocate the promotion of improved hog breeds, adjust young hogs in a planned way, and encourage the breeding of boars and sows. State-owned pastures and state-owned farms in these areas should give full play to the role of experiments, demonstrations, and promotion of improved breeds. At present, there is a tendency for the number of young hogs, sows, and boars to decrease in some areas; these areas should study and take some appropriate measures from the aspects of feed arrangement and young hog prices to change this abnormal situation. There are also some areas that lacked the habit of raising boars and sows in the past, and the source of young hogs is very small. When arranging assigned raising and assigned purchase work in these areas, a certain proportion of boars and sows can be assigned.
    In the work of assigned raising and assigned purchase, the need for farmers to eat meat must be taken care of. Areas where assigned raising and assigned purchase are implemented can implement the method of giving priority to supplying a certain amount of pork or lard to households participating in assigned purchase. On the premise of ensuring the completion of the assigned purchase task, hog raising households should be allowed to slaughter and eat or sell the fattened hogs raised by farmers, and no one should interfere. Only by resolutely implementing this principle can we increase the enthusiasm of farmers to raise hogs.
    After correctly implementing the hog assigned raising and assigned purchase policy, the state and farmers in areas where assigned raising and assigned purchase are implemented can develop hog production in a planned way to supply the needs of cities, industrial and mining areas, and areas where assigned raising and assigned purchase are implemented, as well as exports. However, it must be estimated that with the increasing development of agricultural production and the increasing improvement of farmers' lives, in those areas where hog assigned raising and assigned purchase are not implemented, farmers' need for pork will also increase rapidly. Therefore, these areas must, based on this need and the need for hog raising to accumulate fertilizer, lead farmers to develop hog production in their own areas to meet the needs of their own areas. Only in this way can we take care of the present and also take care of the future; take care of the needs of cities, industrial and mining areas, and exports, and also take care of the needs of rural areas. Only in this way can we comprehensively develop hog production.

    正确地贯彻生猪派养派购政策
    陈静之
    生猪派养派购是国家为了有计划地发展生猪生产和加强生猪购销计划性而采取的一项重要措施。我国的生猪生产每年都有发展，但是由于城乡人民的物质生活迅速提高，商品猪的产量增长的速度仍然赶不上消费需要增长的速度。目前生猪生产中有很大的分散性和盲目性，使得国家不能有计划地安排生猪的生产和购销工作，农民也不能心中有数地安排生产。这是目前生猪生产赶不上需要量的增长的主要原因。为了加强生猪的产销结合，使商品猪的货源有更可靠的保证，国家决定有重点地逐步地实行生猪派养派购的办法。它的具体做法是：各省、市根据国家的计划指标和本省生猪产销情况，确定实行生猪派养派购的地区，把派养派购任务逐级分配到乡，再由乡具体分配到农户或农业生产合作社，由国营商业部门同乡人民委员会签订合同。农民按照合同规定，按时交售肥猪；国营商业部门按国家规定的合理价格进行收购。实行这个办法以后，就可以在派养派购地区使农民的养猪生产和国家计划密切地结合起来，国家可以根据生产条件和消费需要，有计划地、有重点地发展生猪生产，保证城市、工矿区的猪肉供应和出口猪肉的货源，调节猪肉供应中的地区间、季节间的不平衡性。接受派养派购任务的农民也可以预先知道自己每年要卖多少肥猪给国家和什么时候出卖，这样，也便于安排自己的生产。
    在一九五四年第四季度和今年第一季度，各地曾经进行了生猪派养派购的重点试办。现在，实行生猪派养派购的地区的养猪业都已开始发展。山东省胶县大朱郭乡去年十二月以前只养了三百零五头猪，养猪户还不到全乡总户数的十分之一；试行生猪派养派购以后，从去年十二月到今年二月底，养猪户已由八十六户增加到二百零六户，共养猪四百七十一头（这一期间农民出售和自宰自食的一百六十八头肥猪未计在内）。黑龙江省肇东县滥泥村试行生猪派养派购以后，在一个月内生猪饲养数量就增加了百分之五十一。试行派养派购的地区的养猪户反映：“这个办法很好，不但国家收购任务有保证，自己也能多吃肉；多养猪多积粪肥，还可以多打粮食。”
    生猪派养派购是一件新的、复杂的经济工作，要完成这一任务，必须进行充分的宣传工作、组织工作和正确地贯彻生猪派养派购的政策。
    生猪派养派购工作必须根据国家的需要和生产的可能，有计划地、有重点地推行。目前实行派养派购的重点应该放在大、中城市和工矿区附近的农村地区、交通便利和主要产粮地区、饲料问题较易解决、农业生产方面又急需大量粪肥的地区以及过去养猪较少而又有发展前途的地区。在这些地区推行生猪派养派购，对于保证城市、工矿区人民和出口方面的需要，以及减少长途调拨运输和损耗，都有重要的意义。生猪派养派购的计划指标必须根据国家和人民的需要和积极发掘生猪生产潜力的精神来确定，既要防止片面强调困难、忽视生产潜力和不顾国家需要、把计划订得过小的做法，也要防止不顾当地实际情况而盲目发展的偏向。在确定生猪派养派购的对象时，应掌握个体农户和有组织的生产单位并重的原则，除了要分配给农业生产合作社和个体农户派养派购任务外，对于国营农场、国营和私营糖厂、酒厂、食品加工厂等，也要根据可能条件给予一定的派养派购任务。某些有养猪条件的机关、团体、学校等集体伙食单位，为了减轻国家供应方面的负担，也可以给予一定的派养任务（不派购），但这些单位在养猪中要注意避免浪费粮食的现象。
    解决饲料问题是目前发展生猪生产的关键之一，在实行生猪派养派购的地区，必须尽最大可能来帮助农民增加饲料的来源。这些地区的党政领导机关和农业部门应根据国务院关于春耕生产的决议的精神，发动农民有计划地利用隙地、休闲地和废弃土地种植薯类、瓜类、菜类和其它饲料作物，扩大饲料的产量。此外，还要根据科学分析和实验，确定和推广野生植物、农作物的副产物等代用饲料；对群众已有的利用代用饲料的好经验，必须重视。目前有部分农村工作人员和农民认为只有从根本上解决了大量增产粮食饲料的问题，才能谈得上发展养猪业。这种错误认识必须纠正，因为它会妨碍发挥广大群众从各方面增加饲料来源的积极性。但另一方面也要防止片面地强调只喂青饲料、粗饲料，而忽视帮助农民解决必需的粮食饲料问题的错误做法。我们既要发动群众种植高产的饲料作物，推广代用饲料，又要在粮食统购统销中认真解决农民养猪所必需的精饲料（包括饼饲料）的问题。
    在推行生猪派养派购的地区，还要特别注意加强猪疫的防治工作。农业部门必须大力加强对生猪派养派购地区猪疫防治工作的领导，在重点产猪区应设置牲畜防疫站，及时供应防疫药品，培养和训练农村中的兽医人员，总结和传播群众中防治猪疫的经验，向群众传授防疫知识。国营食品公司也应该大力协助农业部门做好猪疫防治工作，尽一切可能防止猪疫的发生和蔓延。
    在推行生猪派养派购的地区，应提倡推广优良猪种，有计划地调剂幼猪，鼓励饲养公猪、母猪。这些地区的国营牧场和国营农场应充分发挥试验、示范和推广良种的作用。目前，有的地区的幼猪、母猪和公猪有减少的趋势；这类地区应从饲料安排、幼猪价格等方面研究并采取一些妥善的措施，来改变这种不正常的情况。还有一些地区过去缺乏饲养公猪、母猪的习惯，幼猪来源很少，在这类地区布置派养派购工作时，可以派养一定比例的公猪、母猪。
    在派养派购工作中，必须照顾农民吃肉的需要。派养派购地区可以实行优先供应派购户一定数量猪肉或猪油的办法。在保证完成派购任务的前提下，对于农民多养的肥猪，应允许养猪户自宰自食或出售，任何人不得干涉。只有坚决贯彻这个原则，才能提高农民养猪的积极性。
    正确地贯彻生猪派养派购政策以后，国家和实行派养派购地区的农民就可以有计划地发展生猪生产，供应城市、工矿区和派养派购地区以及出口需要。但是必须估计到，在农业生产日益发展，农民生活日益改善的情况下，在那些不实行生猪派养派购的地区，农民对于猪肉的需要也会迅速增长。因此，这些地区就必须根据这种需要以及养猪积肥的需要，领导农民发展本地区的生猪生产，供应本地区的需要。只有这样，才能既照顾到现在，也照顾到将来；既照顾到城市、工矿区和出口的需要，也照顾到农村的需要。也只有这样，才能全面地发展生猪生产。
