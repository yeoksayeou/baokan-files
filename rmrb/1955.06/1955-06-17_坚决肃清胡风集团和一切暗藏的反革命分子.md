Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 17th

The third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily" further fuels the anger in our hearts. These materials further prove that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has close ties with imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. Hu Feng and many key members of the Hu Feng clique are loyal running dogs of the Kuomintang. They wear the cloak of progress, using the most despicable two-faced tactics to deceive the trust of the people, hiding within the revolutionary camp, and ferociously attacking the Party and the people. They are more ferocious and venomous than open enemies.

They hide in our organizations, groups, troops, and factories to carry out sabotage activities. They have not spared our educational institutions and schools. From the exposed materials, it is clear that they have infiltrated many universities and high schools in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xiamen, and other regions, stealing the title of "People's Teacher," and in schools, they "win over people" and "connect with people," engaging in sowing discord, striking, and destroying activities. They use our platforms to spread and expand their influence, corrupting and poisoning the minds of young people, using counter-revolutionary theories to harm our country's next generation. They even say their methods are "too kind," which is extremely cunning and vicious.

These incidents also reveal our lack of political vigilance and serious complacency, giving the enemy the opportunity to infiltrate our ranks. Taking Beijing Normal University as an example, in February 1952, the key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, She Tao's wife, Lu Yu, was transferred to our Education Department. On March 17, Hu Feng immediately wrote to She Tao saying, "Brother Yu going to that school will have great gains," and gave some "instructions" in the letter. In October 1952, She Tao also came to our university to teach, successively teaching "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism" in the Education and Political Education departments. When I was participating in land reform in Sichuan, I had seen She Tao. He disguised himself as progressive, eloquent, and I thought he had some "talent" and was "young and promising." When I heard he was teaching at the Normal University, I thought it was a good thing. But disguise cannot hide the tracks so thoroughly. Later, teachers and students in the Political Education Department discovered that his lectures were not on the mark. However, the seriousness of the problem lies here: although we had discovered that his lectures were not on the mark, we did not take it seriously, investigate, and pursue the matter, thus allowing him to continue poisoning the youth with fake Marxism-Leninism. Looking back, our political vigilance and sense of responsibility were too poor.

Chairman Mao has long told us that the enemy "will not resign themselves to their defeat, they will make their last struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, they will try every day and every moment to restore their power in China." The facts prove it is so. American imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, the Kuomintang bandits are still shouting "counterattack the mainland," and the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has infiltrated our revolutionary ranks, disguised, and colluded with them in "heart-stabbing warfare." However, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, have learned Marxism-Leninism, this invincible doctrine, and have the strength to smash all their tricks. The imperialists occupying Taiwan will eventually be driven out; the Kuomintang bandits will eventually be eliminated; all hidden counter-revolutionaries will eventually be exposed by us and receive the punishment they deserve. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country have exposed the conspiracy of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, making these demons who harm the people's revolutionary cause have no place to hide under the sun. We must resolutely and thoroughly investigate all members of the Hu Feng clique and all counter-revolutionaries, cutting off the magic claws of the American-Kuomintang bandits stretching to the mainland.

The exposure of this incident has given us a serious class education, making us realize that political complacency is the gap for the enemy's activities, making us realize that the enemy wants to infiltrate the "liver" of the people, it must use two-faced methods. It was so in the past and now, and it will be so in the future as long as the enemy does not perish. The more our revolutionary cause develops, the more the enemy infiltrating will hide, and we must also increase our vigilance. This is the serious struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, this is the extremely complex and sharp life-and-death class struggle. We must never be complacent, never relax, and remember what the editorial note of the "People's Daily" on June 10 said: "We must not be too naive, simplifying the complex class struggle."

We must learn to fight against open enemies and also learn to fight against hidden, disguised enemies. We must learn to analyze well and distinguish well. Confucius said, "In the past, when I dealt with people, I listened to their words and believed their actions; now, when I deal with people, I listen to their words and observe their actions." Listening to words and observing actions, this is vigilance. In the past, we believed in the counter-revolutionary She Tao just because he spoke "eloquently" and thus "believed in his actions." In the future, we must learn to distinguish well, not to be so complacent. Of course, this does not mean to suspect everyone, because spreading distrust between the Party and the masses, creating discord among the people, is one of the enemy's cunning ways to harm us. What we need is: to sharpen our eyes, increase vigilance, and with unwavering loyalty to socialist construction, prevent all saboteurs.

Each of us, including our friends in the education sector, today, facing the ferocious attacks of counter-revolutionaries, must not adopt a bystander attitude. We must respond to the Party's call, oppose complacency, strengthen vigilance, overcome liberalism, individualism, and not give the enemy any opportunity, making our revolutionary cause more robust and unassailable. At the same time, we must learn from actual participation in this class struggle, learn, and transform our thoughts, arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism, and more effectively serve the cause of socialist construction. We must learn to identify hidden counter-revolutionaries.

The great conspiracy of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has been completely exposed due to the publication of the third batch of materials. This counter-revolutionary clique is a big alliance of fascist spy bandits, the most vicious enemies of the people nationwide! The backers of this counter-revolutionary clique are American imperialism and the Kuomintang fascist bandits. Their counter-revolutionary goal is to sabotage the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist cause it leads, overthrow the people's regime, and restore fascist rule in China. Their theoretical weapon of struggle is fascism disguised as literature. They have extensive organizations, everywhere looking for targets, "connecting with people," "winning over people," expanding the organization, "opening up work." They also have strict "organizational principles" and "guaranteed struggle." Their strategies and tactics are complex and vicious. They use the "tactic of entering the belly," sending members of the clique to infiltrate the Communist Party, attempting to break through the revolutionary fortress from within; infiltrating certain organizations, troops, schools, unions, and youth leagues, usurping key positions, and deploying conspiracies.

From this, it can be seen that the evil conspiracy of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is extremely vicious. If it were not for the power of the Party to smash this clique, there would be the danger of the Party and the country perishing.

For many years, we have always treated Hu Feng and his followers as friends, patiently trying to win them over and transform them, only to find out that they are counter-revolutionaries disguised as revolutionaries, which we absolutely cannot tolerate. We must loudly and resolutely, thoroughly eliminate them.

At the same time, we must learn from the experience and lessons of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, and be good at identifying such hidden counter-revolutionaries, eliminating them from all fronts, purifying our revolutionary ranks, and ensuring revolutionary victory. But to increase vigilance and enhance political sensitivity, we must also strive to learn Marxist philosophy, thoroughly criticize fascist philosophy, that is, all modern subjective idealism. For example, the speeches of Hu Feng followers are obviously fascist. But we allowed them to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks and even usurp important positions. On the one hand, it is because our ability to distinguish is too poor, on the other hand, it is also because our fighting spirit is not strong enough. In the future, we can only strengthen the study of Marxism to be good at distinguishing the ideological consciousness of counter-revolutionaries, thus exposing their counter-revolutionary conspiracies.

Facts have proven that the Hu Feng clique is a counter-revolutionary clique. They peddle anti-Marxist goods under the cloak of Marxism-Leninism. They organize underground activities to carry out anti-Party and anti-people conspiracies. They establish bases everywhere to usurp the revolutionary literary and artistic front and corrupt young literary and artistic workers. No wonder that when their counter-revolutionary crimes are exposed to the people, the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan want to defend them.

We hate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique not only because they have done counter-revolutionary things but also because they disguised themselves as friends of the Communist Party and the people, using the treacherous tactics of two-faced people to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. It is under their two-faced tactics that their counter-revolutionary theories are sold and young people are deceived into becoming their captives. It is their two-faced tactics that made us complacent, thinking they were just backward in thought, style problems, inappropriate statements, or stubborn in thought, hot-tempered, arrogant, but did not raise the issue to the political level. Therefore, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is our most dangerous enemy.

We always like to use the "way of loyalty and forgiveness" to forgive others' minor flaws, but it is under this attitude that we lose vigilance, giving counter-revolutionaries a chance to exploit, harming the people's cause. The Hu Feng incident has taught us to increase our vigilance a hundredfold, the "way of loyalty and forgiveness" cannot be used on the enemy, especially those who disguise themselves as our friends. I demand that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique be quickly cleansed from among the people, severely punished, and the smooth success of our country's socialist construction ensured.

The third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has stirred up immense anger in my heart. In the past, I still thought: the Party and the people have not wronged them. In the six years since liberation, our country has achieved brilliant successes in politics, economy, military, diplomacy, and education, and our international status has greatly improved. Anyone with a bit of patriotism would be excited and enthusiastic to welcome and participate in the great construction of socialism. Why does the Hu Feng clique hate the Party and the people's revolutionary regime so much? Now I understand: it turns out that Hu Feng, Aleng, and others are people with a background. They have long been closely linked with American-Kuomintang intelligence agencies. When Nanjing was liberated, the people of the whole country were excited and enthusiastic, while the Hu Feng followers thought it was a "new storm" and prepared to "welcome hardship." What is there not to understand? They infiltrated the revolutionary ranks not for the good of the country, not to contribute to the people, but to disguise as revolutionaries for a long time, hiding within the people, doing counter-revolutionary deeds. The Hu Feng clique carries out counter-revolutionary activities with a reactionary political program, a strict organization, planned and strategic. The thirty-thousand-word book is Hu Feng's reactionary program, his so-called "five knives" are actually against all intellectuals in China taking the road of socialist revolution. Unified attack, unified retreat, any action must be approved by Hu Feng, that is his organizational relationship. How to "win over people," "connect with people," how to expand "positions," establish "bases," how to make his members infiltrate the Communist Party to obtain the title of Party member, to steal Party documents, and spy on Party situations, all actions are planned. Their strategies are even more sinister and vicious. They have long been wearing the cloak of Marxism, using two-faced methods, in a hidden way to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Hu Feng followers say: do not "fire guns before the position is strong," but "the main thing is to prepare conditions" to "work hard, lay a good foundation for the masses," "find big targets," aim at the vital points of the revolution to attack. To "penetrate" into the "liver" of the revolutionary ranks, to attack the revolution from within. Therefore, the Hu Feng followers use all means to infiltrate our organizations, troops, schools, factories, people's organizations, and democratic parties, to spread and expand their influence.

With these vicious strategies to sabotage the revolution, can it be said that this is just an internal problem of the literary and artistic circle? Just a problem of literary and artistic thought errors? Just a problem of political thought errors? Those who still hold such incorrect views now, either have a dull political sense or have problems with their stance or thoughts. Those who hold incorrect views, whether intentionally or unintentionally, will make the masses complacent, will cover up the retreat of Hu Feng followers. Therefore, all intellectuals in China must first actively participate in this struggle.

We must learn from this struggle. We must increase vigilance, under the leadership of the Party, resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries hidden in our ranks who are members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. At the same time, we must seriously study Marxism, criticize bourgeois ideology, overcome individualism, the pursuit of fame and wealth, and liberalism—these are the weaknesses that the enemy wants to exploit. Only in this way can we suppress all counter-revolutionaries, complete the glorious tasks given to us by the Party and the state.

Hu Feng and his followers have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks under the cloak of Marxism. They are an anti-Party, anti-people, organized, and planned counter-revolutionary clique.

We, the broad anti-tuberculosis workers, used to think like ordinary non-literary and artistic workers, naively thinking that the Hu Feng problem was just a literary and artistic thought problem, complacently thinking it had nothing to do with us. But when we saw the shocking materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily," we recognized the essence of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, which is to resolutely oppose the Party and the people to the end. They harbor deep hatred for the Chinese Communist Party leading the people to build socialism and socialist transformation. In their minds, only the restoration of the Kuomintang traitor clique is their ultimate goal.

Hu Feng and his followers are our enemies in political struggle and class struggle, and we demand that the government must punish them according to the law. I, on behalf of the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association, call on all members of the anti-tuberculosis associations across the country and all anti-tuberculosis workers to join this great struggle, resolutely expose the hidden Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members, and all counter-revolutionaries similar to the Hu Feng clique.

We must increase vigilance, strengthen unity, and strengthen the study of dialectical materialism to thoroughly criticize idealism, so that the enemy has no gaps to exploit, to fight for the victory of the anti-tuberculosis cause, and to fight for the great cause of socialist construction.

The "People's Daily" has continuously published three batches of materials about the Hu Feng reactionary clique, fully proving that the Hu Feng clique is a thorough counter-revolutionary clique. They have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks for many years, acting as running dogs of imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, using the most treacherous and despicable methods to attempt to sabotage the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. I am filled with boundless hatred for the evil activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and firmly advocate the severe suppression of all counter-revolutionaries.

When the criticism of Hu Feng's thoughts first began, I, like many natural scientists, was not vigilant enough, thinking it was a thought problem in the literary and artistic circle, having nothing to do with us natural scientists. Even when the "People's Daily" published the first batch of materials about the Hu Feng clique, I only thought that Hu Feng's individualism was very serious, he probably wanted to seize the leadership of the literary and artistic circle, and opposing the Party probably wouldn't go that far. But now I know that this idea was a big mistake. Now the mask of the Hu Feng clique has been completely torn off. Kuomintang spies, reactionary officers, revolutionary traitors, etc., are all their key members.

For more than twenty years, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has worn the cloak of Marxism, worn the mask of literary and artistic workers, infiltrated the people's revolutionary ranks, carried out various counter-revolutionary activities, conspired to sabotage our socialist construction, and overthrow our people's democratic regime. They curse the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary power of the people as "evil communists," want to use "cluster grenades," "not to do, to rest," and fantasize that "three months can break the main force, one year can clean up." These facts, can they not prove that the Hu Feng clique is the loyal running dogs of imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, the mortal enemies of our people nationwide?

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary followers use extremely cunning and two-faced methods to infiltrate government agencies, military agencies, educational agencies, as well as newspapers and unions, even usurping key positions. This is like sleeping with a tiger, how dangerous!

I have now completely awakened. As a natural scientist, I cannot think that the disputes in the literary and artistic circle, the thought problems in the literary and artistic circle, have nothing to do with natural scientists. The idea of "not my business, hang it up high" is "politically insensitive, simplifying things too naively." Our people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are working day and night, selflessly and diligently, building our socialist society. But imperialist invaders and counter-revolutionaries will use every means to sabotage our socialist construction. The Hu Feng clique can infiltrate our literary and artistic circle, who can guarantee that the evil counter-revolutionaries will not infiltrate the ranks of natural scientists? Therefore, we must increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen the study of Marxism, join the struggle to criticize idealist thoughts, strictly draw the line between enemies and us, expose the counter-revolutionary evil activities of the Hu Feng clique from all aspects, more closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, thoroughly smash the conspiracies of internal and external enemies, and fight for the socialist construction of the state to the end!

The important thing is to increase political vigilance.

After reading the first two batches of materials about the Hu Feng clique published in the "People's Daily," people have already realized that Hu Feng and his companions, who have long worn the cloak of Marxism, are actually a counter-revolutionary clique hiding within the people's ranks. On June 10, the "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, further proving that Hu Feng and many key members of the Hu Feng clique have long been closely linked with imperialism and Kuomintang intelligence agencies. They are the loyal running dogs of the Kuomintang traitors. Exposing the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique makes them unable to continue hiding, deceiving the people, and carrying out sabotage. This is a major victory in our country's struggle against traitors.

The danger of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique lies in their disguise. In the past, many people were deceived by them, either thinking they were good people or only thinking they were a group of people with "literary and artistic thought errors," which facilitated their conspiracies and went undetected for a long time. Sichuan is a place where the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has been active for a long time. They published "Hope" in Chongqing, "Breath" in Chengdu, and also published the "Wild Rooster Literary Series." All of these were tools for them to spread reactionary thoughts and poison young people. All young people who have long read the publications of the Hu Feng clique have been poisoned to varying degrees. Recently, many young people in Chengdu who have been poisoned by Hu Feng's reactionary thoughts have, after awakening, accused the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. In the past, some wanted to participate in the revolutionary activities against the Kuomintang, wanted to join the Communist Party, but the Hu Feng clique members told them: "Art is politics, this is unnecessary"; many young people hated the dark rule of the Kuomintang, wanted to go to Yan'an, but the Hu Feng clique members told them: "Where there is life, there is struggle," preventing them from going to the liberated areas. People are right, the Kuomintang bandits set up concentration camps in Xi'an to detain young people going to Yan'an, while the publications of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique are another concentration camp to detain young people. The "literary and artistic activities" of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique are thus in coordination and cooperation with the Kuomintang intelligence agencies. Based on materials known only recently, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang intelligence agencies divided the revolutionary and progressive literary and artistic ranks in Chongqing at that time into "Communist Party faction" and "close to the Communist Party faction." These were their "targets for attack" and "investigation," while Hu Feng belonged to the "targets for work." Now the truth is clear, of course, there is no need for further explanation. Hu Feng and the Hu Feng clique, who have worked well for the Kuomintang intelligence agencies, are both "attacking" and "investigating" the revolutionary and progressive literary and artistic ranks, and have close ties with spies, knowing each other very well, what need is there to be a "target for work"?

After liberation in 1951, Hu Feng came to Sichuan again to "participate" in land reform work. In actual work, Hu Feng protected the landlords and struck at the peasants. After the land reform work was completed, Hu Feng returned to Chongqing and gave a speech at a meeting of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, advising people not to expose the evils of the feudal land system and the landlord class, but to write about what "the spiritual burden of the peasants"; not to sing the praises of heroes, models, and Party members, but to write about "other characters outside them." We refuted this fallacy at the time, but still treated him as a friend to criticize, although this "friend" was quite strange. Now the truth is clear, of course, there is nothing strange about it, always aiming the blade at the people, at the Communist Party, at the revolutionary ranks, this is what all flowery words cannot cover up. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has hidden in the people's ranks for such a long time, only recently exposed, and the Hu Feng clique members in Chengdu were discovered only after the whole country had exposed them, this fact proves that our political vigilance is far from enough. We must eliminate all counter-revolutionaries hiding within the people's ranks, we cannot sleep with tigers. Hu Feng is a representative elected by Sichuan to the National People's Congress. Now that his fake face is removed and his true face is exposed, he is a hidden counter-revolutionary, an enemy of the people. We who elected him have the right to exercise our power, revoking his status as a representative of the National People's Congress. The Constitution Article 19 stipulates the suppression of all treasonous and counter-revolutionary activities, punishing all traitors and counter-revolutionaries. Hu Feng, this extremely hateful counter-revolutionary who firmly opposes the people, should be punished according to the law. From the materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, it can be seen that the enemy is not reconciled to the victories we have achieved, and is determined to sabotage the ongoing socialist construction and socialist transformation. As long as counter-revolutionaries can hide for a day, they will sabotage for a day. Increasing political vigilance and being good at identifying disguised enemies is the most important lesson we should learn from the Hu Feng incident.

The Hu Feng and other counter-revolutionaries will not escape the grip of the people.

The materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique recently continuously exposed by the "People's Daily" (especially the third batch of materials) fully prove the counter-revolutionary, anti-Party, and anti-people crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a group of organized, programmatic, and strategic enemies who wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, attempting to sabotage the revolutionary cause from within the revolution. They have long been closely linked with imperialist Kuomintang intelligence agencies and are the loyal running dogs of imperialism and the Kuomintang. For more than twenty years, they have long disguised as revolutionaries, infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, using two-faced methods, strategically using the "tactic of entering the belly," attempting to disintegrate the people's revolutionary army from politics, thought, and finally from organization, sabotage the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and sabotage the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Such resolute counter-revolutionaries must be subjected to legal sanctions. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the condemnation of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique by the people of the whole country, and suggest revoking the status of the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng as a representative of the National People's Congress and all his positions, and severely punishing him according to the law!

The fact that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique infiltrates the revolutionary ranks to carry out counter-revolutionary activities shows that with the progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and the sharpening of class struggle, imperialism and the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits will definitely use every means to carry out sabotage activities. If our political sense is not acute and our revolutionary vigilance is not high, we will allow the conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries to succeed, causing losses to the revolutionary cause. If we do not strive to learn, strengthen training, strengthen the concept of relying on the leadership of the Communist Party, constantly improve socialist awareness, and be good at distinguishing true from false, right from wrong, we may be fooled by counter-revolutionaries, fall into their trap unknowingly. Therefore, everyone must increase political sensitivity and revolutionary vigilance, only in this way can we see through the counter-revolutionaries hiding in the revolutionary ranks and not be deceived and misled by them.

As a member of the China Democratic League, which has a close connection with intellectuals, we should strive to learn Marxism-Leninism theory, improve the level of Marxism-Leninism thought, continue to seriously study the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, more closely rely on the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen the unity of the League, constantly fight against individualism, liberalism, individual heroism, and other bourgeois thoughts, oppose the tendency of not caring about politics, draw the line between idealism and materialism, gradually expand the socialist ideological front, and contribute more strength to the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland. At present, we should actively participate in the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, resolutely eliminate the Hu Feng clique and all counter-revolutionaries from the revolutionary ranks.

Our revolutionary strength is powerful, and the people have rich experience in struggle and the ability to distinguish counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, no matter how the Hu Feng followers and similar counter-revolutionaries use any means to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, they will eventually not escape the grip of the people.

Leave no room for counter-revolutionary cliques to hide.

The publication of the "third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique" has made us see more clearly the political background of the Hu Feng clique. They have close ties with imperialist Kuomintang intelligence agencies, have long disguised themselves, and hidden within the people to do counter-revolutionary deeds. Hu Feng and his followers, therefore, have such deep hatred for the people's revolutionary regime, for Party comrades and progressive writers outside the Party, for our new undertakings, for mastering the communist worldview, for thought reform, for deeply entering the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, all of which they oppose, resist, sabotage, and curse viciously, ah, it turns out that all these are means to sabotage the people's revolutionary regime!

What is there to say, what doubts, what excuses!

To regard revolutionary strength as "withered leaves" and "decaying corpses"; to slander our great struggle against counter-revolutionaries as "feudal forces are crazily killing people"; to regard our method of training cadres as "not far from Hitler"; to describe the flourishing literary and artistic circles after national liberation as "in the field of literature and art, there is hardly a piece of clean land." Hu Feng organizes his followers to write letters to the Party Central Committee, "accusing" the Party's responsible comrades in the literary and artistic circles, etc., there is no need to quote more, the intentions of Hu Feng and his followers are clearly evident, their organized spy actions are obvious to all readers.

After this sinister conspiracy was exposed, it not only made us have a common anger but also made us learn a profound lesson from this incident. We must eliminate all disguised counter-revolutionaries hiding in our ranks. Of course, this is not limited to the literary and artistic circles, in organizations, groups, and any place, we must also be vigilant and not allow counter-revolutionaries to have any hiding place!

We have the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, no matter how cunning, vicious, disguised, and changing the counter-revolutionaries are, they will never escape the eyes of the people and the recognition of all. However, we must first be very strong ourselves, learn from the lessons, distinguish between enemies and us, do not be complacent and relaxed, giving counter-revolutionaries a chance to act!

As for the handling of Hu Feng and his followers, today I saw the several suggestions of Comrade Deng Chumin in the "People's Daily," I fully agree.

"If the enemy does not surrender—destroy him!"

In my illness, I struggled to read the materials about the Hu Feng reactionary clique, which is the layer-by-layer exposure of the ugly face of this clique. I am so angry that my head is about to split, and I cannot calm down at all.

Looking at Hu Feng's cunning, vicious, and shameless "private talks," one really has to endure physical disgust to bear it. The most hateful thing is that he hypocritically "follows" Marx, Lenin, Mao Zedong, and the Communist Party; on the other hand, he viciously slanders the Party and the Party's literary and artistic policies, and is arrogant enough to call Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" an "idol." Just for these, everyone can judge: Hu Feng is not precisely the "robber and swindler" hiding in the revolutionary ranks? Not precisely the "beast" that cannot be treated as a human being?!

Since our newspapers and cultural and artistic circles launched the criticism of Hu Feng's thoughts, Hu Feng suddenly became particularly polite to people. Not long ago, I met him in the Beijing Hospital, he also went to "treat his illness." He turned back to shake hands with me. I was too sick to stand up and did not respond. Who knew he was "smiling with contempt" and shaking hands with us "in friendship." His hand is the hand that holds the "whip wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners" and the "cluster grenade" to attack us, it is also the hand that commands his followers to launch a ferocious attack on the Party and the literary and artistic front led by the Party, using various tactics, infiltrating the Party to steal documents and spy on situations!

The Hu Feng anti-Party clique still wants to "stay in the cave for a while" and "seek rebirth," waiting for their good time. But the people will do as Gorky said: "If the enemy does not surrender—destroy him!"

I am troubled by brain disease, my thoughts are difficult to concentrate and speak much, but as long as there is a breath, I will join everyone to denounce these dregs of humanity, the secret forces of foreign imperialism and the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits, the shameful traitors of the people!

Living with wolves for twenty years.

After reading the third batch of materials about Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique's crimes exposed by the "People's Daily," I felt extremely angry, and at the same time, my mind kept repeating this thought: we have lived with wolves for twenty years.

Like other comrades, I am not ignorant of Hu Feng. I have long felt that Hu Feng is not honest, likes to play tricks, and is extremely cunning and treacherous. However, before his counter-revolutionary activities were exposed, I rarely thought further, whether he was also dishonest, not honest to the Party, to the people, to the revolution?

I still remember, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, I once talked to a comrade about such confused words, "Fortunately, it is the literary and artistic circle, if Hu Feng moves his tricks to politics, he would have been a ghost long ago!" From this, one can see how confused my own understanding was at the time, as if our literary and artistic front was not part of the whole revolution, allowing any counter-revolutionary sabotage activities.

Just looking at the damage Hu Feng caused to the revolutionary literary and artistic front during the "Left League" period, I think Hu Feng's crimes are also unforgivable. This damage, every comrade who participated in the "Left League" activities, both inside and outside the Party, will remember it clearly. He has always been stirring up trouble, breaking up unity; on the other hand, pulling and dragging, "strengthening strength." If anyone was seriously working for the revolution, unwilling to approach Hu Feng, he would use all kinds of methods to strike and expel them.

From the exposed materials, it can be seen that Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary purpose at that time was already very clear, that is, to disintegrate the revolutionary literary and artistic front, make it degenerate! I remember clearly, although the majority of comrades insisted on the struggle, but due to Hu Feng's constant conspiracy to create various personnel disputes within the "Left League," some upright comrades even became passive, unwilling to do the work of the "Left League," ran to other places to write in seclusion. Some did not want to live in Shanghai. In the summer of 1934, I myself was also tormented by the rumors and slander created by Hu Feng, resulting in running to Qingdao to live for two or three months.

Regarding Hu Feng's political background, we have long suspected it. During the "Left League" period, everyone turned to underground work, but Hu Feng could still work at the Nationalist Party's Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Institute. This matter made us feel strange. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Hu Feng also worked at the Nationalist Party's National Defense Propaganda Office in Li Zhibei, Chongqing, under the control of the big spy Wang Kecheng. This is not unknown to people. However, although it is known and suspected, it has never been seriously investigated; it has not been regarded as a serious problem, reflected to the Party, which proves that I was not enough concerned about revolutionary interests!

In 1946, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique took me as the typical example of objectivism and cursed me fiercely. But when I went to Chongqing in the summer of 1946 to participate in the work of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, because the general comrades advocated "not to consume strength," I still met Lu Hongji, who was connected with Hu Feng, and Aleng in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. This Kuomintang spy chief, at that time, also aroused my suspicion, because his dress showed that he was a high-ranking reactionary officer, but when asked, he said he was studying in the "Army University" research class in the cave... Due to the wise leadership of the Party and the brave exposure of the masses, the ugly face of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique has finally been exposed. This is a great victory for our country and people; but I believe that every comrade who used to mistakenly think that Hu Feng could be won over will be greatly surprised when looking at the materials. From the Hu Feng incident, we should learn lessons, increase our understanding, and become a revolutionary warrior with keen political sensitivity and sufficient class vigilance.

I recall an old incident. In 1939, I returned to Chongqing from Yan'an and lived in the South Bank Copper Coin Bureau Yuhua Farm, the home of Comrade Song Zhi. A few days later, Comrade Zhi gave me a letter to read, which was written by Hu Feng, asking him to invite me to write; saying: Old Sha is from Yan'an, "July" published his article, he Hu Feng will have a lighter sentence when judged by the revolutionary court in the future... For those who do not agree with him, Hu Feng has always been sharp and sarcastic, this is known to everyone, so at the time I did not pay much attention. Now looking back, he was not mocking me, he was mocking the revolution; because it is very clear, in Hu Feng's eyes, the Chinese people will never stand up, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek will never fall!

But Hu Feng! You, this hybrid of fox and wolf, your dirty plans have long failed! And the revolutionary court of the people will never forgive you! It will not allow you to make any excuses! Your counter-revolutionary crimes of the past twenty years will be the basis for your punishment.

Severely punish Hu Feng! Thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique!

Do not give counter-revolutionaries a chance to exploit.

After seeing the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily," we are filled with boundless anger. We fully agree with the thorough exposure and settlement of the counter-revolutionary, anti-Party, and anti-people crimes of the Hu Feng clique, and demand that those stubbornly wrong-headed ringleaders be severely punished according to the law.

From the facts exposed in the third batch of materials, it can be seen that the mainstay of the Hu Feng clique is the spy elements, reactionary officers, and Trotskyites hidden in our revolutionary ranks. Their masters are imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. They, under the orders of their masters, use various cunning and vicious methods to engage in political conspiracies, attempting to sabotage and disintegrate our revolutionary cause from within.

From the Hu Feng incident, we have learned a profound lesson. We, these literary and artistic workers, due to the lack of theoretical study and ideological tempering in the past, therefore, small-bourgeois thoughts and liberal sentiments are still quite serious. This time, seeing that counter-revolutionaries take advantage of the liberalism of some of our cadres, we are truly shocked. Through the exposure of the Hu Feng incident, we not only recognize the complexity and sharpness of class struggle but also increase our vigilance, and further examine ourselves. In the future, we must strive to learn Marxism-Leninism theory, improve political awareness, distinguish right from wrong, only in this way will we not be deceived and misled by counter-revolutionaries.

We also recognize that the settlement of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a major victory in our country's political struggle. No matter how cunning the Hu Feng followers are, using what kind of strategy, the eyes of the people are bright, counter-revolutionaries will eventually not escape the net of the people. We demand to continue to investigate all Hu Feng followers and make them honestly confess, we will not allow stubborn counter-revolutionaries to go unpunished.

We must root out counter-revolutionaries.

After seeing the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique exposed by the "People's Daily," the artists in Shanghai feel boundless anger. The mainstay of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is imperialist and Kuomintang spy elements, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and turncoats. They are the mortal enemies of the people, they hate the people and the revolution to the bone. They attack the people's revolutionary forces to "not do, to rest." If we still talk about kindness and tolerance to counter-revolutionaries, that would be cruelty to the people.

The Chinese people have achieved today's victory with the blood and heads of countless revolutionary martyrs! The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique hates our victory to the bone, resolutely opposes the people, and uses every means to sabotage the revolutionary regime, using cunning and vicious methods to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, attempting to usurp the people's regime from within. This is our mortal enemy! We should resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, only in this way can we do justice to the revolutionary martyrs.

This group of counter-revolutionaries not only infiltrated the revolutionary ranks but also infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party. They are originally counter-revolutionaries, they have long been vicious enemies of communism, and should be punished according to the law.

The crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique are very clear, like Hu Feng, who used two-faced methods to infiltrate our revolutionary ranks, other counter-revolutionaries, we must also eliminate them. We must increase our political vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen the study of Marxism, strengthen the unity of the people, thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionaries. We can no longer sleep with tigers, our political vigilance is really too poor for hidden counter-revolutionary activities, we must increase vigilance!

Firmly fight against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

After seeing the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the "People's Daily," I am even more indignant and sober.

This Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is not only unrelated to the revolution but also, with their attitude of "hating this social order," they do not even have the qualifications to be a citizen of China.

We all have some social knowledge, but what kind of person can do anti-communist political work in the "Jiangxi anti-communist" army, what kind of person can be a military instructor in Hu Zongnan's "War Academy Fourth Brigade," what kind of person can work in the "Chinese-American Cooperative Organization," what kind of person can carry out the reversal of land reform, forcing peasants to die, what kind of person has the qualifications to "request" that "Beiping Police Chief" spy chief, is it not clear? If it is not from the "Chinese side," how can one feel "the national army frequently recaptures," feel that "the people's hearts are settled"? How can one feel that "a new storm is coming," "hope to welcome hardship"? The Kuomintang reactionaries' crazy attacks on the liberated areas are a great disaster for the people, but they feel that "the people's hearts are settled." Needless to say, our victory is their disaster. We are happy to build a socialist society, but they feel "hate this social order." We have the people's democratic dictatorship system, we have the people's constitution, for a true person, laborer, and citizen, it is naturally respected, but they say "people still defile people." Yes, they are right, for those who have done unspeakable things in the "Chinese-American Cooperative Organization," "War Academy Fourth Brigade," "anti-communist" army, and those who have forced peasants to die, we must "defile" and suppress them. If we are lenient to these "people," then it is the "defilement" of true laborers and citizens. Their counter-revolutionary actions are not serious? Can we still let them go to Taiwan to listen to "speeches" and be "inspired"? Can we still let them do the reversal of land reform on the heads of peasants? They have a lot of "dark wisdom," this "wisdom" has made us suffer a lot. We know that those who have no connection with the revolution can only be loyal to Chiang Kai-shek, loyal to the "Chinese-American Cooperative Organization," we should suppress them without mercy!

Mobilize everyone, smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

After reading the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily," I am filled with boundless anger. In the past, I still thought: the Party and the people have not wronged them. In the six years since liberation, our country has achieved brilliant successes in politics, economy, military, diplomacy, and education, and our international status has greatly improved. Anyone with a bit of patriotism would be excited and enthusiastic to welcome and participate in the great construction of socialism. Why does the Hu Feng clique hate the Party and the people's revolutionary regime so much? Now I understand: it turns out that Hu Feng, Aleng, and others are people with a background. They have long been closely linked with American-Kuomintang intelligence agencies. When Nanjing was liberated, the people of the whole country were excited and enthusiastic, while the Hu Feng followers thought it was a "new storm" and prepared to "welcome hardship." What is there not to understand? They infiltrated the revolutionary ranks not for the good of the country, not to contribute to the people, but to disguise as revolutionaries for a long time, hiding within the people, doing counter-revolutionary deeds. The Hu Feng clique carries out counter-revolutionary activities with a reactionary political program, a strict organization, planned and strategic. The thirty-thousand-word book is Hu Feng's reactionary program, his so-called "five knives" are actually against all intellectuals in China taking the road of socialist revolution. Unified attack, unified retreat, any action must be approved by Hu Feng, that is his organizational relationship. How to "win over people," "connect with people," how to expand "positions," establish "bases," how to make his members infiltrate the Communist Party to obtain the title of Party member, to steal Party documents, and spy on Party situations, all actions are planned. Their strategies are even more sinister and vicious. They have long been wearing the cloak of Marxism, using two-faced methods, in a hidden way to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Hu Feng followers say: do not "fire guns before the position is strong," but "the main thing is to prepare conditions" to "work hard, lay a good foundation for the masses," "find big targets," aim at the vital points of the revolution to attack. To "penetrate" into the "liver" of the revolutionary ranks, to attack the revolution from within. Therefore, the Hu Feng followers use all means to infiltrate our organizations, troops, schools, factories, people's organizations, and democratic parties, to spread and expand their influence.

With these vicious strategies to sabotage the revolution, can it be said that this is just an internal problem of the literary and artistic circle? Just a problem of literary and artistic thought errors? Just a problem of political thought errors? Those who still hold such incorrect views now, either have a dull political sense or have problems with their stance or thoughts. Those who hold incorrect views, whether intentionally or unintentionally, will make the masses complacent, will cover up the retreat of Hu Feng followers. Therefore, all intellectuals in China must first actively participate in this struggle.

We must learn from this struggle. We must increase vigilance, under the leadership of the Party, resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries hidden in our ranks who are members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. At the same time, we must seriously study Marxism, criticize bourgeois ideology, overcome individualism, the pursuit of fame and wealth, and liberalism—these are the weaknesses that the enemy wants to exploit. Only in this way can we suppress all counter-revolutionaries, complete the glorious tasks given to us by the Party and the state.

Title: The Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counterrevolutionary Clique
Author: 赵国有
Date: 1955-06-10
Page: 1

The publication of the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique has left no doubt: this clique's core members are completely and thoroughly American and Nationalist Party spies and bandits. No wonder they were so "hateful" towards us, "hateful" towards our "social order," and were so ruthless in trying to bring down our "social order." They were following the instructions of their masters to subvert the people's government.

Like all American and Nationalist Party spies, the vicious and cunning Hu Feng gang also employed every possible and impossible means to infiltrate our Communist Party, government, and various people's organizations, stealing secrets, developing organizations, seizing leadership, establishing counterrevolutionary strongholds, and plotting to destroy our "social order" without firing a shot. How audacious!

Tell the Hu Feng gang, just like your masters' tragic failure, you will never achieve what you dream of, a world where "people have no contradictions" under the Nationalist Party's dictatorship. Complete annihilation is your true fate.

The Hu Feng gang's infiltration into some leadership positions and their seizure of leadership power must certainly mean that they have closely collaborated with other American and Nationalist Party spies, developed organizations, and established "bases" to jointly sabotage us. They can steal party documents, so they can certainly steal more state secrets and intelligence and offer them to their American and Nationalist Party masters. Therefore, we request the government to thoroughly investigate the treasonous crimes of these bandits.

We workers and the people of the entire nation must mobilize together and launch an attack on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary bandits, completely eliminating the disguised counterrevolutionaries hiding among the workers. We must not allow the Hu Feng gang to continue to roam freely, harming our working class and the people of the nation. I, on behalf of the workers, demand that the government, according to the "Regulations for the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries," give the Hu Feng gang severe punishment and resolutely suppress the counterrevolutionaries.

We must increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold.

Title: Learning from the Lesson of the Hu Feng Counterrevolutionary Clique
Author: 邵象华
Date: 1955-06-10
Page: 1

The "People's Daily" has published three batches of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, clearly exposing the true nature and political background of this organization that harms the state and the people. Reading these materials fills me with great indignation. I have never read any of Hu Feng's works. When the criticism of Hu Feng's thoughts began, we thought it was just a literary and artistic thought problem, perhaps they were just some individualist careerists. But the materials published by the "People's Daily" have proven conclusively that Hu Feng and many of the core members of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique have long been counterrevolutionaries closely linked to imperialism and the Nationalist Party. Look, before the nation's liberation, they were inspired by the Nationalist Party's "confidence" in being able to "defeat the main force in three months and eliminate it in one year," feeling "more inspired" and "full of optimism." When their master, Chiang Kai-shek, was continuously defeated by the People's Liberation Army, and the people of the nation were rejoicing in their liberation, they saw it as "suffering." After the nation's liberation, they did not give up but formulated the most vicious and cunning strategies and plans to attack the Party and the people. I demand that the positions of Hu Feng and other ringleaders in the state and other departments be revoked, and that they be severely punished according to the law.

The exposure of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique once again proves that counterrevolutionaries often attempt to infiltrate revolutionary ranks to carry out sabotage from within. I think, although the Hu Feng clique was discovered in the literary and artistic circles, their counterrevolutionary activities are not limited to the literary and artistic circles. Especially in heavy industry, such an important link in building socialism, counterrevolutionaries will certainly not let go. Therefore, in heavy industry enterprises, every person needs to be even more vigilant, expose and eliminate Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique members. For scientific and technological workers, it is even more necessary to learn from this lesson. Some of us have very poor political sense. Engrossed in scientific and technological research, forgetting politics, is not an isolated phenomenon at present. I think such people are most likely to sleep with a tiger without realizing it, and may become targets for counterrevolutionaries to develop organizations. Didn't the Hu Feng gang regard "liberalism" as a "testable" condition? Therefore, we scientific and technological workers should strengthen our self-reform, study Marxism-Leninism, improve our ideological and political levels, and always fight resolutely against all hidden counterrevolutionaries who harm the cause of socialist construction.

Title: Strictly Guard Against Hidden Counterrevolutionaries Sabotaging Our Victory Fruits
Author: 安朝俊

Page: 1

From the "People's Daily" continuously published three batches of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, we clearly know that this counterrevolutionary clique is an organized, planned, and systematic counterrevolutionary clique. They wore the cloak of Marxism, disguised as revolutionaries, and pretended to be progressives, hiding within the revolutionary ranks, secretly engaging in anti-Party and anti-people crimes. From the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, we also know what kind of people these counterrevolutionaries are. They have long been closely linked to the Nationalist Party traitor clique and imperialists. The backbone of this clique is composed of Nationalist Party spies, military instructors, landlords' return-to-home teams, and counterrevolutionaries with blood on their hands. They are the faithful running dogs of the Nationalist Party bandits and imperialists. This group of counterrevolutionaries harbors deep hatred for the new society and the people's revolutionary government after liberation, using every means to engage in sabotage activities, attempting to overthrow the people's democratic government of New China. But this group of counterrevolutionaries forgot that New China is led by the Communist Party, which has been tested by time, and by Chairman Mao. The Communist Party is invincible. This group of counterrevolutionaries has now revealed their true colors in front of the people, which is another victory for the Party and the people in their struggle against the enemy. I am a worker in a steel plant. We are all working day and night to build a socialist motherland, but this group of counterrevolutionaries is secretly engaging in counterrevolutionary activities. We hate this group of counterrevolutionaries and demand that the government immediately revoke all their positions and resolutely suppress them, cleaning out this pile of garbage. At the same time, we workers must also speed up the study of Marxism-Leninism, improve our political awareness, and learn to fight against hidden counterrevolutionaries. Recently, our factory's night school caught a counterrevolutionary. He did not work properly after coming to the factory, stirred up trouble among the cadres, and initially, the leadership thought he just had some ideological problems and educated him, but it had no effect. Later, after a detailed investigation, it was discovered that he was a counterrevolutionary. Therefore, the workers in our enterprises, especially the leaders, should always be vigilant, strictly guard against all hidden counterrevolutionaries sabotaging our victory fruits. We must strive to complete the tasks given to us by the state. We must resolutely smash the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique and all hidden counterrevolutionaries' plots.

Title: Severely Suppress the Hu Feng Counterrevolutionary Clique

After reading the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily," I am truly furious. Hu Feng and many of the core members of the Hu Feng clique have long been loyal running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party and have had close ties with imperialist spy agencies. They harbor deep hatred for the new society and the people's revolutionary government after liberation, hating the new society and dreaming of the "demise" and "collapse" of the people's revolution. After the nation's liberation, they have been secretly plotting to launch a ferocious attack on the Party and the people, using every means to infiltrate the Communist Party, steal party documents, and gather party intelligence, collaborating internally and externally to engage in various counterrevolutionary activities. From their above counterrevolutionary facts, we clearly understand that these despicable and cunning enemies are so vicious.

For twenty years, Hu Feng's gun has been aimed at the Communist Party and the revolutionary camp. They organized forces, established strongholds, and continuously engaged in evil activities. The true face of Hu Feng and this group of counterrevolutionaries has now been completely exposed. We absolutely cannot allow them to continue to engage in conspiracy and sabotage within our revolutionary ranks. I demand that according to the "Regulations for the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries," these counterrevolutionary elements be severely punished. We will not rest until we have completely eradicated all hidden counterrevolutionaries!

In this exposure of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary incident, I fully realize the sharpness and complexity of class struggle in the transitional period of building a socialist society. The struggle against Hu Feng's counterrevolutionary plots is another major victory for our wise Communist Party leading the people on the revolutionary front. However, the enemy's plots to sabotage us will not stop here. Therefore, we medical workers must increase our vigilance a hundredfold, strive to strengthen the study of Marxism, closely unite, and actively participate in the struggle to expose the crimes of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique. Only in this way can we ensure the smooth completion of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Title: The Crimes of Counterrevolutionaries Must Be Punished Accordingly
Author: 彭仰钦
Date: 1955-06-10
Page: 1

The first two batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng clique's counterrevolutionary activities were already enough to make one furious, but the third batch of materials further proved that the core members of this reactionary clique are thorough spies and enemies of the people. We demand that the government, according to the "Regulations for the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries," severely punish the ringleaders of this counterrevolutionary clique, Hu Feng, and the die-hard counterrevolutionaries such as A Lang and Lu Yuan, and completely smash this counterrevolutionary clique.

The Hu Feng anti-Party, counterrevolutionary clique is very cunning. They publicly claim to be "progressive writers" but secretly harbor hatred for the Party, progressive writers, the people, and the victory of the revolution, attempting to drag the liberated working people back to their original state of hunger and poverty. No one with a shred of humanity would or could do such a thing.

Today, the true ugly face of the counterrevolutionary clique led by Hu Feng has been exposed. Lu Yuan is a spy from the "China-U.S. Cooperation Organization." A Lang is a Nationalist Party officer. Just from the things these two have done, one can see who their political background and bosses are.

The "China-U.S. Cooperation Organization" is an organization of American and Nationalist Party spies specializing in massacring revolutionary comrades and progressive masses. The number of comrades and innocent compatriots sacrificed in the "China-U.S. Cooperation Organization" is incalculable. This blood debt is immeasurable. We must investigate the issues of Lu Yuan and others. For accomplices, except for those who thoroughly confess and surrender, the rest should also be given appropriate legal punishment.

We must be extremely vigilant, strengthen the study of Marxist theory, and fight resolutely to smash this anti-Party, counterrevolutionary clique and defend the people's victory fruits!

Title: Hu Feng Must Be Severely Punished
Author: 欧阳山

While traveling, I saw in the newspaper the two batches of materials published on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique and felt immense anger. Hu Feng is so heartless and despicable that he cannot be regarded as human. He is a spy, a special agent, a devil in human skin!

Guo Moruo said well: We were too careless, always treating Hu Feng as a friend, truly saying that we slept with a wolf. Of course, we are opposed to Hu Feng's "subjective fighting spirit" theory, opposed to Hu Feng using bourgeois idealism and individualism to corrupt the masses, opposed to Hu Feng's slander and incitement against the Party's leadership, Party and non-Party writers. But why did he do this? We still didn't understand. He advocated "subjective fighting spirit," what benefit did it bring him? He wanted to use bourgeois idealism and individualism to corrupt the masses, what benefit did it bring him? He wanted to slander the Party's leadership, incite conflicts between Party and non-Party writers, what benefit did it bring him? We still didn't understand. We still thought like an honest person: "How could it be like this? That's clearly beneficial to the enemy!"

But isn't it exactly like this! Isn't it exactly so! Only at this moment did we understand: the person we were arguing with was the enemy himself. He was not just a small or big bourgeoisie, nor was he just a writer or an ambitious person. He was much more straightforward and clear-cut. He was the enemy. If he didn't do things beneficial to the enemy, that would be strange! Only at this moment did we understand: why during the time in Shanghai and Chongqing, revolutionary writers were arrested and killed, but he was openly employed in the reactionary government of the Nationalist Party. He was not just a revolutionary; he was not even a writer. His true intention was to destroy our Party, to destroy our revolutionary government, to destroy our entire beautiful socialist future.

This wolf, this devil, though his skills are small, his plots are huge and laughable. He still dreams of the restoration of the counterrevolutionary government. He still wants to use "heart-digging warfare" to deal with us. He is still sharpening his sword. He is still preparing a "cellar" for us, preparing for the day when he will use a whip wrapped in rubber and steel to "entertain" us. Good, let them try. Is the Chinese people so easy to bully? We have the people's democratic dictatorship, we have the public security organs, we have the courts, all spies and special agents have their proper places. We must severely punish Hu Feng! We must protect all our people, not allowing Hu Feng's rubber-steel whip to harm us even a bit!

The Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, counterrevolutionary clique must quickly come out and confess to the people, redeem their sins. We, the entire people, must also increase our vigilance, absolutely not allowing any Hu Feng clique members or any counterrevolutionary spies and special agents to sneak into our stomachs!

Title: Uproot the Hu Feng Counterrevolutionary Gang Completely
Author: 徐光耀
Date: 1955-06-10
Page: 1

The filthy and stinking truth of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique is now fully exposed.

From the "Battle Brigade Four" of Hu Zongnan and the "Mountain Cave Army University" in Chongqing, from the anti-communist political organs of the "Jiangxi Bandit-Suppression Army," from the "China-U.S. Cooperation Organization," from the counterattack and revenge landlord gangs... The backbone of the Hu Feng clique is composed of such a group.

No wonder they use "cluster bombs," originally it was the battle tactics instructors from Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's troops; no wonder they use "whips wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners," originally it was taught by the "China-U.S. Cooperation Organization" of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek; no wonder they are so proficient in strategies like "digging into the heart," "penetrating into the liver," "lying down and playing dead"... originally, they learned it from the "Jiangxi Bandit-Suppression Army." Their counterrevolutionary criminal activities have a history of twenty years.

Thanks to the Party's wise leadership, the Party, with its all-seeing eyes, saw through this big deception, making the snake spirits and nine-tailed foxes have no place to hide, making us awaken and become alert. The Party made us achieve another great victory in the struggle against the hidden and ferocious enemies!

However, the struggle is developing, and the victory must be expanded. The Hu Feng group of counterrevolutionary devils, who have long "persistently" cultivated their "mass base," must have planted their roots in various places. We, the People's Liberation Army, must be even more vigilant. We cannot imagine that such a bandit clique would not be interested in the military. Facts have proven that some Hu Feng members have already infiltrated the troops. This is something we must not overlook. We must investigate. No matter what kind of counterrevolutionaries, we cannot sleep with them. To ensure the high purity of the revolutionary people's ranks, all big and small roots of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary gang must be completely uprooted!

Title: No More Complacency
Author: 唐克新
Date: 1955-06-10
Page: 1

The "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, with iron-clad evidence proving that the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique is a group that has always been anti-Party, anti-people, and counterrevolutionary, loyal running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek, and enemies of the people. The true face of this counterrevolutionary clique that infiltrated the revolutionary ranks is now finally completely exposed!

In fact, the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique are quite obvious in many places, but we were too complacent. The Hu Feng clique has always used their "articles" to curse and ridicule the revolutionary government, the Communist Party, and the policies of the Communist Party, to damage the prestige of the Communist Party and the people's government. Yet, there are still some overly "naive" people who always seem to think that the word "literature and art" cannot be connected with the word "counterrevolution." Those naive people think: "How can literature and art be counterrevolutionary?" The enemy is much "smarter" than these people; they found the best "air-raid shelter" in "literature and art." Thus, the Nationalist Party spies and reactionary officers infiltrated, using the cover of literature and art to spread counterrevolutionary theories, sowing discontent with the Communist Party and the people's government, attempting to ultimately overthrow the people's government.

As the "People's Daily" editorial pointed out: "Many of us have low vigilance against hidden counterrevolutionaries, and some have completely lost vigilance." In our factory, if a machine is found to be sabotaged by counterrevolutionaries, we will be alert! But for such a large-scale counterrevolutionary clique like Hu Feng, many of us still think, "This is just a matter of the literary and artistic circles, they won't come to our factory to sabotage our machines, it has nothing to do with us." Yet, we do not know that the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique is digging at the roots of our socialism. This is a very frightening complacent thought! To consolidate the revolutionary government, to defend the cause of socialism, to be responsible to the 600 million people, I demand that the government resolutely and thoroughly purge the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique and, according to the law, severely punish Hu Feng, A Lang, and other die-hard counterrevolutionary ringleaders!

Title: Resolutely Eliminate Hu Feng and His Counterrevolutionary Clique
Author: 于非闇
Date: 1955-06-10
Page: 1

The issue of Hu Feng and his counterrevolutionary clique is not just a matter of subjective idealism, nor is it just about the so-called attempt to seize the Party's leadership over literature and art. It is clear that Hu Feng is a thorough counterrevolutionary spy. His counterrevolutionary clique is a "commando unit" secretly engaged in subversive activities within our people; they are public enemies and must be resolutely suppressed.

While we were criticizing the counterrevolutionary Hu Shi, we also read "Hu Feng's views on literary and artistic issues." In Hu Feng's six-point manifesto, in addition to the so-called "five knives," he also arrogantly advocated the abolition of the Party's unified leadership over literature and art. In my politically naive and dull state, I only thought that Hu Feng's problem was merely one of subjective idealism, "self-expansion" individualism, and the like, and did not have the counterrevolutionary political background like Hu Shi.

The "People's Daily" published the first and second batches of materials on Hu Feng and his counterrevolutionary clique in May, exposing the true face of the Hu Feng clique. Hu Feng and his group secretly "recruited people" and "contacted people," using "cluster bombs" to decide to launch an "assault," but I still thought they only wanted to seize the Party's unified leadership over literature and art. I spoke at a symposium and wrote short articles, completely without doubt, based on this shallow understanding, thinking that Hu Feng and his counterrevolutionary clique were only problems within the literary and artistic circles, and did not delve deeply. On June 10, the "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique. I suppressed my indignation and read it, feeling that I was ignorant and naive. Is the issue of Hu Feng and his counterrevolutionary clique still only a problem within the literary and artistic circles? They are spy gangs, public enemies! I must start learning from scratch, learn to distinguish counterrevolutionaries, deeply expose their plots, and defend the motherland.

We in the art circle must, together with the people of the entire nation, resolutely denounce Hu Feng and his counterrevolutionary clique. We demand a thorough investigation of Hu Feng and his counterrevolutionary clique's entire criminal activities, and according to the law, punish the leader of the counterrevolutionary "commando unit" Hu Feng; for the counterrevolutionaries in the Hu Feng clique, appropriate treatment should be given according to the situation.

Title: Fight to Completely Smash All Counterrevolutionary Cliques

Page: 1

The "People's Daily" has published three batches of materials exposing the counterrevolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique, which clearly prove that the Hu Feng clique is a loyal running dog of imperialism and the Nationalist Party bandits, the most treacherous and vicious enemy of the Chinese people.

This counterrevolutionary clique has long had close ties with American and Nationalist Party spy agencies. They regard the people's revolutionary forces as "pus," believing that "it must be expelled." Their counterrevolutionary attitude is very firm, "not doing one thing means not doing another." Their tactics are to attempt to "penetrate into" our "liver." Their ultimate goal after the nation's liberation is to overthrow the people's revolutionary government and make it "collapse," allowing American imperialism and the Nationalist Party bandits to climb back onto the heads of the people.

We are a group of art educators. Seeing these exposed materials, we are filled with great anger and hatred. We resolutely support the decision of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers' Association to expel Hu Feng's membership and revoke all his positions; we demand the immediate revocation of Hu Feng's position as a representative of the National People's Congress and request the government to punish Hu Feng and other members of the counterrevolutionary clique with serious crimes according to the law; we demand that the followers of the Hu Feng clique honestly confess to the people and start anew.

Under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will increase our revolutionary vigilance, thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique within our work units, and purify our ranks.

We have also learned a lesson from this: in this stage of sharp class struggle, the enemy's attacks on us are becoming more and more ferocious, and their sabotage methods are more treacherous and cunning. If we are still complacent, we will cause greater losses to the people's cause.

We have a clearer understanding of the importance of strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism and constantly reforming and improving our thoughts.

With full confidence, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will fight to completely smash all counterrevolutionary cliques and complete the cause of socialist construction.

After reading the several batches of secret letters of Hu Feng and his followers, we clearly saw Hu Feng's ferocious face, and we can no longer suppress our immense anger. All of us held a meeting to denounce Hu Feng and decided to take unified action to defend our new China's people's literary and artistic front and our sacred revolutionary cause, completely smashing the Hu Feng anti-Party, counterrevolutionary conspiracy clique's ferocious attack!

We are a group of military literary and artistic workers. From our personal experience, we have proven that the Party's literary and artistic policies are extremely correct, and Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is like a beacon, illuminating our path forward. We absolutely cannot tolerate any slander from the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique. We will fight to the end! Hu Feng has long been secretly plotting to "expand" the strength of his conspiracy clique and launch such an organized and planned fierce attack on us, which is not just a thought problem but a serious political counterrevolutionary conspiracy.

We demand that Hu Feng be punished according to the law.

We clearly remember: the Nationalist Party bandits in the "China-U.S. Cooperation Organization" used the most brutal methods to massacre our countless revolutionary comrades. It turns out that the core members of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique were the most ferocious and brutal executioners who massacred our revolutionary forerunners. We express our deep hatred to our government and the people of the nation and present our demands:

First, we firmly demand that the government, according to the "Regulations for the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries," deal with the members of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique appropriately.

Second, we firmly respond to the call of the "People's Daily," actively participate in the struggle to suppress the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique. We must use the spirit of fierce pursuit to expose the big and small crimes of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique from all aspects, and strive to completely eliminate the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique. At the same time, we must also learn from this lesson, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, and more resolutely and thoroughly eliminate all open and hidden counterrevolutionary cliques and counterrevolutionaries.

The exposure and smashing of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique is a great victory for our Party and the revolutionary cause. From this, we also deeply feel that our Party is indeed invincible, and the great Chinese people led by our Party are invincible. We are deeply inspired by our victory.

With immense anger, we read the materials published in the "People's Daily" and other newspapers about the Hu Feng clique. These materials provide iron-clad evidence, fully proving that Hu Feng and the core members of his clique have long been spies closely linked to imperialism and the Nationalist Party bandits. Regarding the various despicable and cunning deeds of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, we believe that a thorough investigation must be conducted, and the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique must be resolutely suppressed.

The Hu Feng counterrevolutionary incident has deeply educated us, making us further realize the complexity and sharpness of class struggle in the transitional period. Those classes that have been or will be eliminated will never be willing to accept their own death. They will certainly use every opportunity to sabotage our Party and the people's cause, attempting to restore reactionary rule in China. We, along with people from all walks of life across the nation, must increase our revolutionary vigilance, identify and expose all hidden class enemies, and resolutely eliminate them from the revolutionary ranks, protecting our great socialist construction cause as we would protect our eyes.

The counterrevolutionary plots and crimes of the Hu Feng clique have now been exposed. From the several batches of materials already published in the "People's Daily," it is clear that the Hu Feng clique is an organized group with close ties to imperialism and Nationalist Party spies. We express our utmost anger and hatred towards Hu Feng and his followers, who, under the guise of Marxism, use Marxist language to oppose Marxism, and under the guise of supporting the Communist Party, oppose the Communist Party. These counterrevolutionaries are wearing masks, hiding in the dark, and this time, their crimes have been exposed, which is another great victory for our people's revolutionary cause! We must actively participate in this fierce class struggle and strive to thoroughly purge all counterrevolutionaries.

After the "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, it aroused even greater anger within us. This batch of materials made us see more clearly the true face of these loyal running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party. Before the nation's liberation, they enthusiastically pinned their hopes on the Nationalist Party's anti-people civil war, foolishly dreaming that they could "strike down the main force in three months" and "eliminate it in one year." They harbored such deep hatred for the Chinese people's revolution, demanding to "not do one thing means not doing another" to extinguish the Chinese people's revolutionary cause. After liberation, they continued their counterrevolutionary activities with even more cunning two-faced tactics. We read these materials and are filled with immense hatred. We demand that the people's court immediately arrest the counterrevolutionary Hu Feng and the core members of the Hu Feng clique, punish them according to the law, and conduct a public trial. We must catch them all, not allowing a single member of the Hu Feng clique to escape the people's net.

We have continuously read the materials exposing the crimes of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, and we are filled with immense anger! Hu Feng's disguise has been torn off, revealing him to be the most vicious counterrevolutionary, a cunning and vicious plotter, a wolf with sharp teeth. For twenty years, Hu Feng has had a manifesto, organization, and strategy to launch a ferocious attack on the Party and the revolution. They sent spies to infiltrate the Party, divide and disintegrate the revolutionary ranks, attack and slander the Party's leadership, and sabotage the revolutionary cause. Their ultimate goal is to seize the leadership and carry out a counterrevolutionary restoration. The Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique is our most vicious enemy!

We demand that Hu Feng be punished according to the law. We also demand a thorough investigation of all the crimes of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique.

With great anger, we read the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique. We demand a further thorough investigation of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique's ties with imperialism and the Nationalist Party bandits, resolutely suppress Hu Feng and other unrepentant ringleaders in the clique, and continue to vigorously purge all hidden Hu Feng members and other counterrevolutionaries, resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely eliminate them! We tell all Hu Feng members: the working people's world is established, New China is unshakable, and whoever opposes the people will meet their doom.

This incident has given us a profound lesson. We deeply realize that we should not be indifferent or negligent towards the sharp class struggle but should increase our revolutionary vigilance. The continuous victories of socialist construction and the desperate situation of the enemy make them necessarily adopt all vile means to fight against the revolution. Therefore, we must systematically strive to study Marxism-Leninism, especially learn from the Party's experience in fighting against all anti-Party cliques, and increase our revolutionary vigilance.

We realize the serious harm of individualism and liberalism to the revolution. Our every flaw and mistake, especially liberalism and individualism, is the soil and air suitable for the existence and expansion of the enemy. We are determined to do the work of plugging holes, overcome all non-proletarian thoughts, and strengthen our ideological construction.

The publication of the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique has exposed the true nature of the Hu Feng clique—their core members have long been loyal running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party, closely linked to imperialist and Nationalist Party spy agencies. Before the nation's liberation, they long harbored hatred for the people's revolutionary forces, pinning their hopes on the Nationalist Party's anti-people civil war and the failure of the people's revolutionary forces. After the liberation of the mainland, the Hu Feng clique harbored deep hatred for the people's government, cursing the people's revolutionary government to "perish" and "collapse."

The Hu Feng counterrevolutionary members used two-faced tactics to hide within revolutionary organizations and within the Party. The lessons from these facts make us deeply realize that our vigilance is not high. Therefore, we must increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold. As long as we truly increase our vigilance and strengthen our political sense, all counterrevolutionaries will be exposed by us!

We love our socialist revolutionary cause and will not allow counterrevolutionaries to sabotage it.

When I saw the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng clique's anti-Party and anti-people activities, I couldn't help but recall the dark days under the rule of the Nationalist Party bandits. I still clearly remember the "China-U.S. Cooperation Organization" established by the Nationalist Party bandits, which was a concentration camp for massacring Communist Party members and progressive people. People still clearly remember that in 1949, when the people's revolution was about to achieve complete victory, just before Chongqing was liberated, the Communist Party members and progressive people arrested by the reactionaries in the Semenzi Cave (the "China-U.S. Cooperation Organization") were brutally massacred by the Nationalist Party spies at that time. They were martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the liberation of the motherland. It turns out that the Hu Feng clique was one of the executioners who murdered these patriotic martyrs. This blood debt will never be forgotten.

I can no longer suppress my indignation. I want to accuse them: Now is the time for the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique to repay their blood debt.

After reading the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counterrevolutionary Clique," we are all filled with even greater indignation. This group of evil counterrevolutionary bandits has committed heinous crimes for more than twenty years. They used cunning methods, disguised as revolutionaries, infiltrated the people's revolutionary ranks, and engaged in counterrevolutionary sabotage activities. Now we have exposed their true colors, and we must not allow the Hu Feng clique members to continue their evil deeds. We demand that the government punish Hu Feng and other core members of the counterrevolutionary clique according to the law, completely eliminate them, and continue to purge their evil influence. We must increase our vigilance a hundredfold and fight against all hidden counterrevolutionaries.

Now, the disguise of the Hu Feng clique has been completely exposed.

This group of loyal running dogs of imperialism and the Nationalist Party bandits used cunning two-faced tactics to infiltrate various revolutionary organizations. Publicly, they wore a "progressive" and "honest" face; secretly, they viciously engaged in various plots, gnashing their teeth and cursing the "demise" and "collapse" of the revolutionary cause.

The Hu Feng clique is simply a group of murderers who do not shed blood, our mortal enemies! They are more cunning than foxes and more vicious than wolves! We will never coexist with such counterrevolutionaries and must completely, thoroughly, and entirely eliminate them!

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee taught us: In the period of socialist transformation, class struggle is more acute and complex. The Hu Feng incident made me concretely understand the profound significance of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session. In the future, we may encounter enemies more cunning and vicious than Hu Feng. We must keep our eyes open, always be on guard against those like Hu Feng, and with our iron fists, smash their plots.

We are translation workers from the Bureau of Cultural Relations. After seeing the three batches of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, we believe that the counterrevolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng clique are not limited to this. We must continue to investigate.

Facts have proven that the Hu Feng clique is a group of wolves in sheep's clothing, a group of spies who resolutely oppose the people, hiding within the revolutionary ranks. They are organized, planned, have a manifesto, strategy, and tactics, attempting to sabotage the revolution from within. We cannot tolerate such spies roaming freely. We solemnly demand that the government quickly arrest Hu Feng and the core members of the Hu Feng clique, punish them according to the law, and thoroughly search for Hu Feng members hidden in various places, completely purging the "Hu poison" that harms the people.

The cunning and treacherous true face of Hu Feng and the Hu Feng clique has been exposed to the world. It turns out that this clique has long been closely linked to American and Nationalist Party spy agencies, acting according to the line of Chiang Kai-shek. No wonder the Hu Feng clique harbors such deep hatred for our Party Central Committee, for our Party member writers and non-Party progressive writers, no wonder the Hu Feng clique hates our social system and curses our revolutionary government to "perish" and "collapse."

We believe that the Hu Feng clique must have committed more counterrevolutionary crimes. Therefore, we must further thoroughly investigate all the counterrevolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng clique, and for those in the Hu Feng clique who do not repent, we must punish them according to the law.

When I saw in the newspaper the third batch of materials on the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, I was very indignant. Because I am a person who loves literature and respects writers. Hu Feng, this wolf, wore human skin and used Marxism to decorate his surface, seemingly very bright. But he viciously opposed the Party, and now his true colors have been exposed.

Hu Feng wanted to use his fangs to kill the revolution, wanted to push the Party and the people down politically, which is the most intolerable. What makes me even more indignant is that Hu Feng did evil deeds but wrote deceiving confessions.

Hypocrisy has failed, the mask has been torn off, this despicable wolf has been exposed naked. When we read the manuscript denouncing Hu Feng in the cooperative, people unanimously said: "What use is he, he is a disaster, quickly eliminate him!"

I strongly agree with eliminating him. The fruits of the people's hard work are for those who serve the people and seek the people's welfare, we cannot let such a vicious person eat the people's grain.

From the three batches of materials continuously published in the "People's Daily," it is clear that the anti-Party, anti-people, and counterrevolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique are iron-clad. I am filled with great indignation and demand that the people's government resolutely suppress the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique.

The third batch of materials has irrefutably proven that Hu Feng, who claimed to have followed the revolution for twenty years, and many of the core members of his clique, are loyal running dogs of the Nationalist Party bandits. These core members were originally Nationalist Party spies, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and turncoats. They wholeheartedly supported and participated in the Nationalist Party's anti-people civil war, slandered and hated the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army. They ferociously hated the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, attempting to overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship and restore the Nationalist Party traitor clique. Towards such counterrevolutionaries who hate the Party, hate the people, and hate the revolution, can we forgive them? No, we cannot. I demand: Immediately arrest Hu Feng and other major criminals such as A Lang, and punish them according to the law.

专栏：

    坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
    学会同隐藏的敌人作战
    陈垣
    “人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，更使人抑制不住心头的愤怒。这批材料，进一步证明了胡风反革命集团是同帝国主义蒋介石匪帮有着密切联系的。胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子，是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗。他们披着进步外衣，以最卑鄙的两面派的手段，骗取人民的信任，潜伏在革命阵营之中，疯狂地向党和人民进攻，他们比公开的敌人更加凶残、狠毒。
    他们暗藏在我们的机关、团体、部队、工矿里来进行破坏活动，他们也并没有放过我们的教育机关和学校。从已揭发的材料看来，他们就曾打入北京、天津、上海、南京、厦门等地区很多大学和中学里，窃取到“人民教师”的称号，在学校里“争取人”“联络人”，进行挑拨离间、打击、破坏等活动。他们利用我们的讲坛，散布和扩大他们的影响，腐蚀和毒害青年的思想，拿反革命的理论来戕害我们祖国的下一代。他们还说他们的“做法还是太善良了”，这真是非常阴险毒辣的手段。
    这些事件同时也说明我们自己缺乏政治警惕性，有着严重的麻痹大意思想，给了敌人混入我们内部的机会。以我们北京师范大学来说，一九五二年二月胡风反革命集团骨干分子谢韬之妻卢玉，被调整到我校教育系，三月十七日胡风马上给谢韬写信说“玉兄到那学校，当大有收获”，并在这信里有所“指示”。一九五二年十月谢韬也来我校兼课，先后在教育、政治教育等系讲“马克思列宁主义基础”。我在四川参加土地改革的时候曾见到过谢韬，他伪装进步，能说会道，我以为他有一定“才干”，“年轻有为”，听说他来师范大学兼课，还认为是一件好事。但伪装决不会把马脚掩饰得那样严密。后来政治教育系的教师和同学就发现他讲课讲得不对头。不过问题的严重性也就在这里：虽然我们已经发现他讲课不对头，但是并未严肃对待，认真考查追究，就这样容许他用假的马克思列宁主义继续占据着我们的讲坛来毒害青年。事后看来，我们的政治警惕性和工作责任感是太差了。
    毛主席早就告诉过我们，敌人“决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟”。事实证明，正是如此。美帝国主义还盘踞在我们的领土台湾，蒋介石匪帮还在叫喊“反攻大陆”，胡风反革命集团则钻到我们革命队伍里，伪装起来同他们里应外合地进行“挖心战”。但是，中国人民有了伟大的中国共产党的领导，学习了马克思列宁主义这一战无不胜的学说，是有足够的力量来粉碎他们一切阴谋诡计的。盘踞在台湾的帝国主义者迟早要被赶出去；蒋介石匪帮迟早要被消灭；隐藏着的一切反革命分子迟早也都要被我们识破，受到应有的惩处。现在，全国人民在党的领导下，已经揭穿了胡风反革命集团的阴谋，使这些危害人民革命事业的恶魔们，在光天化日之下无处藏身。我们一定要坚决彻底追查出所有的胡风集团分子和一切反革命分子，斩断美蒋匪帮伸到大陆上来的魔爪。
    这一事件的揭发，使我们自己受到了一次严重的阶级教育，使我们认识到政治上的麻痹，就是敌人活动的空隙，使我们认识到敌人要想钻进人民的“肝脏”中来，就一定用两面派的办法。过去和现在是如此，在今后只要敌人不灭亡，也依然会如此。我们革命事业越发展，打进来的敌人就越要隐蔽，我们也就越要提高警惕，这就是革命同反革命的严重斗争，这就是极复杂的尖锐的你死我活的阶级斗争。我们万万不可麻痹，不可松懈，要记住“人民日报”六月十日编者按语所说的“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”
    我们要学会同公开的敌人作战，也要学会同隐蔽的暗藏的敌人作战。要学会善于分析，善于辨别。孔子说“始吾于人也，听其言而信其行；今吾于人也，听其言而观其行”，听其言观其行，这就是警惕性。以前我们对反革命分子谢韬就是听他讲得“头头是道”于是就“信其行”了。今后要学会善于辨别的本领，不能再这样麻痹。当然，这决不是说要乱猜疑人，因为在党和群众之间散播不信任的种子，制造人民群众之间的不和，正是敌人中伤我们的阴险手段之一。我们要的是：擦亮眼睛，提高警惕，以对社会主义建设的无限忠诚来防止一切破坏分子。
    我们每一个人，包括我们教育界的朋友们，今天，面对反革命分子的猖狂进攻，绝对不能采取旁观态度，我们一定要响应党的号召，反对麻痹，加强警惕。克服自由主义，个人主义，不给敌人任何可乘之机，使我们的革命事业日益坚强巩固，无懈可击。同时我们自己要从实际参加这一阶级斗争中，来学习，来改造思想，以马克思列宁主义武装自己，更有效地来为社会主义建设事业服务。
    要善于识别暗藏的反革命分子
    李达
    胡风反革命集团的大阴谋，由于第三批材料的公布，完全暴露了。这个反革命集团是一批法西斯特务匪徒的大联盟，是全国人民最凶恶的敌人！这个反革命集团的后台老板，是美帝国主义和蒋介石法西斯匪帮。它的反革命目的是要破坏中国共产党和它所领导的社会主义事业，使人民政权垮台，使法西斯统治在中国复辟。它的理论斗争武器是贴上文学招牌的法西斯主义。它有广泛的组织，到处物色对象，“联络人”，“争取人”，扩大组织，“开辟工作”。它还有严密的“组织原则”，“保证斗争”。它的战略和战术是复杂而毒辣的。它用“钻进肚皮去的战术”，派遣集团分子混进共产党，企图从内部攻破革命堡垒；混入某些机关、部队、学校、工会和青年团，窃据要职，施展阴谋手段。
    由此可见，胡风反革命集团的罪恶阴谋是穷凶极恶的。假使不是依靠党的力量击破这个集团，那就会有亡党亡国的危险。
    多年以来，我们一直把胡风分子当做朋友看待，耐心地争取他们、改造他们，却不料他们竟是伪装革命的反革命分子，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。我们必须大张旗鼓、集中火力，坚决彻底地铲除他们。
    同时，我们要从胡风反革命集团事件吸取经验教训，百倍提高警惕，善于识别这类暗藏的反革命分子，把他们从各个战线上清除出去，来纯洁我们革命的队伍，保证革命的胜利。但为要提高警惕，加强政治嗅觉，还必须努力学习马克思主义哲学，彻底批判法西斯主义哲学即现代一切主观唯心主义。例如胡风分子的言论显然就是法西斯主义的。而我们却让他们混进革命阵营，并且窃据重要职位，这一方面是由于我们的辨别能力太差，一方面也由于我们的斗争性不够坚强。今后我们只有加强马克思主义的学习，才能善于辨别反革命分子的思想意识，因而揭露他们的反革命阴谋。
    胡风反革命集团是我们最危险的敌人
    林汉达
    事实已经证明，胡风集团是反革命集团。他们在马克思列宁主义外衣之下贩卖反马克思主义的货色。他们组织地下活动进行反党反人民的阴谋。他们在各处建立据点，来篡夺革命的文艺阵地和腐蚀青年文艺工作者。无怪今天，当他们的反革命的罪行暴露在人民的面前的时候，台湾的蒋介石匪帮要为他们辩诉了。
    我们痛恨胡风反革命集团，不仅因为他们做了反革命的事情，还由于他们装做共产党的友军、人民的朋友，以暗害者的伎俩进行反革命活动。正是在他们这种两面派的卑鄙手法下面，他们的反革命的理论才得以出售，才得以迷惑青年作他们的俘虏。正是他们的这种两面派手段才麻痹了我们，以为他们不过是思想落后、作风问题、说法不妥当，或者是思想顽固、脾气大、狂妄，而并没有提到政治的高度上看待这个问题。所以胡风反革命集团是我们的最危险的敌人。
    我们对人总喜欢用“忠恕之道”，原谅人家一些小缺点，但正是在这种态度之下失去了警惕性，给反革命分子钻了空子，危害人民的事业。胡风事件教训了我们，要百倍提高我们的警惕，“忠恕之道”不能用于敌人，尤其是装得像我们的朋友的敌人。我要求迅速把胡风反革命集团从人民中间清洗出去，严惩这批反革命分子，保证我们祖国的社会主义建设事业的顺利成功。
    提高警惕，坚决肃清胡风反革命集团
    廖世承
    关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，激起了我心中无比的愤怒。过去我还在想：党和人民没有错待他们。解放六年来，祖国在政治、经济、军事、外交、文教各项事业上都有辉煌成就，国际地位已经大大地提高。稍有爱国良心的人，没有一个不欢欣鼓舞地来迎接和参加社会主义的伟大建设。为什么胡风集团这样咬牙切齿地仇恨党、仇恨人民革命政权？现在我明白了：原来胡风、阿垅等人都是别有来历的人。他们都是很早就同美蒋特务机关有密切联系的。南京解放，全国人民兴奋鼓舞，而胡风分子认为是“新的风暴”，准备“迎接苦难”。这还有什么不明白吗？他们钻入革命队伍，不是为了祖国好，不是想对人民有所贡献，而是长期地伪装革命，潜藏在人民内部，干着反革命勾当。胡风集团进行反革命勾当，是有反动的政治纲领，有严密的组织，有计划、有策略的。三十万言书就是胡风的反动纲领，他所说的“五把刀子”，实际上就是反对全中国知识分子走社会主义革命的道路。统一进攻、统一退却，任何行动都要经胡风同意，就是他的组织关系。怎样“争取人”“联络人”，怎样扩大“阵地”、建立“据点”，怎样使他的分子打入共产党内取得党员称号，以便窃取党内文件，探听党内情况，一切行动都是有计划的。他们的策略更是阴险毒辣。他们是长期地披着马克思主义的外衣，用两面派的手法，以隐蔽的方式来进行反革命活动。胡风分子说：不要“在阵地未强固前就放起枪来”。而“主要是：准备条件”要“埋头工作，把群众基础弄好”，“找大的对象”，对准革命的要害加以攻击。要“深入到”革命队伍的“肝脏里面”，从革命的内部来攻打革命。因此，胡风分子千方百计地打入我们的机关、部队、学校、工厂、人民团体和民主党派内，以散布和扩大他们的影响。
    用这些恶毒的策略来破坏革命，能说这仅仅是一个文艺界内部的问题吗？仅仅是一个文艺思想错误的问题吗？仅仅是一个政治思想错误的问题吗？到现在还抱这种不正确看法的人，不是政治嗅觉太麻木，就是立场有问题，或思想有毛病。看法不正确的人，不论有意的或无意的，会麻痹群众的警惕性，会掩护胡风分子退却。所以全中国知识分子必须首先积极地投入这一斗争。
    我们必须在这个斗争中吸取教训。我们要提高警惕，在党的领导下，坚决肃清胡风反革命集团的一切暗藏在我们队伍中的反革命分子。同时，我们必须认真学习马克思主义，批判资产阶级思想，克服个人主义，名利观念和自由主义——这都是敌人所要利用我们的弱点。只有这样，我们才能将一切反革命分子镇压下去，完成党和国家给予我们的光荣任务。
    彻底消灭胡风反革命集团
    黄鼎臣
    胡风反革命集团披着马克思主义的外衣，打入了革命阵营。它是一个反党、反人民，有组织、有计划的反革命集团。
    我们广大的防痨工作者，从前也和一般非文艺工作者一样，天真地以为胡风问题只不过是文艺思想问题，麻痹地以为同我们无关。但是，当我们看到“人民日报”上公布的关于胡风反革命集团的一批一批的触目惊心的材料，才认识到胡风反革命集团的实质，就是坚决反党、反人民到底的。他们对中国共产党领导全国人民进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业，怀着深深的仇恨。在他们心目中，只有蒋介石卖国集团的复辟，才是他们的最终目的。
    胡风反革命集团分子是我们政治斗争、阶级斗争中的敌人，我们要求政府必须分别轻重依法惩处他们。我代表中国防痨协会总会号召防痨协会各地分会全体工作同志和全国的防痨工作者们，投身到这一次伟大的斗争中去，坚决地揭发隐藏着的胡风反革命集团分子，和类似胡风集团的一切反革命分子。
    我们必须提高警惕，加强团结，加强辩证唯物主义的学习，彻底批判唯心主义，才能使敌人无隙可乘，为保卫防痨事业胜利，保卫伟大的社会主义建设事业而奋斗。
    自然科学工作者应该投入斗争
    金善宝
    “人民日报”连续发表了关于胡风反动集团的三批材料，完全证实了胡风集团是彻头彻尾的反革命集团。他们多年来混进了革命的队伍，做着帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的走狗，以最阴险最卑鄙的手段，企图破坏中国人民的革命事业。我对胡风反革命集团这种罪恶活动，表示无比的痛恨，坚决主张将全部反革命分子予以严厉的镇压。
    当胡风思想批判最初开展的时候，我和许多自然科学工作者一样，警惕性是很不够的，以为这是文艺界的思想问题，同我们自然科学工作者没有什么关系。甚至当“人民日报”发表胡风集团第一批材料的时候，我只认为胡风的个人主义很严重，他大概想夺取文艺界的领导权，反党大概还不至于吧。但我现在知道，这种想法，是犯了极大的错误的。现在胡风集团的假面具完全被揭穿了。国民党的特务，反动军官、革命叛徒等等都是他们的骨干分子。
    胡风反革命集团二十多年来披着马克思主义的外衣，戴了文艺工作者的假面具，钻进了人民革命的阵营，进行各种反革命活动，阴谋破坏我们的社会主义建设，颠覆我们的人民民主政权。他们谩骂中国共产党和人民革命的力量是“万恶的共匪”，要使用“集束手榴弹”，“一不做，二不休”，妄想“三个月可以击破主力，一年肃清”。这种事实难道还不能证明胡风集团是帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的忠实走狗，是我们全国人民的死敌吗？
    胡风反革命分子用极其巧妙和两面派的手法，混进了政府机关，军事机关，教育机关，以及报馆和工会，甚至窃据了要职，这等于我们同老虎一起睡觉，多么危险啊！
    我现在完全觉醒了。作为一个自然科学工作者，不能认为文艺界的纠纷，文艺界的思想问题和自然科学工作者没有什么关系。这种事不关己，高高挂起的想法，是“政治上嗅觉不灵，把事情想得太天真了”。我国人民在中国共产党领导下，正在夜以继日，忘我地辛勤劳动，建设我们的社会主义社会。但帝国主义侵略者，和反革命分子要以千方百计来破坏我们的社会主义建设事业。胡风集团可以钻入我们的文艺界，谁能保证万恶的反革命分子不会混进我们自然科学工作者的队伍来？因此，我们必须百倍地提高革命的警惕性，加强马克思主义的学习，投入批判唯心主义思想的斗争，严格地划清敌我界限，从各方面揭发胡风集团的反革命罪恶活动，更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，彻底粉碎内外敌人的阴谋，为国家社会主义建设而奋斗到底！
    重要的是提高政治警惕
    廖井丹
    人们读了“人民日报”所发表的前两批有关胡风集团的材料以后，已经恍然大悟，一向披着马克思主义外衣的胡风和他的伙伴们，原来是隐藏在人民阵营内的一个反革命集团。六月十日“人民日报”又发表了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，更进一步证明胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子，很早以前就同帝国主义和国民党特务机关有密切联系。他们是蒋介石卖国贼的忠实走狗。揭穿胡风反革命集团的真相，使他们不能继续隐藏下去，欺骗人民，进行破坏，这是我国人民反奸斗争的一个重大胜利。
    胡风反革命集团的危险，在于他们的伪装。过去不少人被他们欺骗，或者把他们看成好人，或者仅仅把他们看成只是“文艺思想有错误”的一伙人，这就便利了他们的阴谋活动，长期没有被察觉。四川是胡风反革命集团活动较久的地方，他们在重庆出版过“希望”，在成都出版过“呼吸”，还出版过“荒鸡文艺丛书”等。所有这些，都是他们传播反动思想，毒害青年的工具。凡是长期阅读过胡风集团刊物的青年，他们的思想都受到不同程度的毒害。最近成都不少受过胡风反动思想毒害的青年，在觉悟之后，对胡风反革命集团提出了控诉。在过去他们有的要求参加反对蒋介石国民党的革命活动，要求参加中国共产党，但胡风集团分子告诉他们：“艺术即政治，这是不必要的”；很多青年痛恨国民党的黑暗统治，要求到延安去，但胡风集团分子告诉他们：“哪里有生活，哪里就有斗争”，阻止他们到解放区去。人们说得对，蒋介石匪帮在西安设立集中营来拘禁去延安的青年，而胡风反革命集团的刊物，则是另一个拘禁青年的集中营。胡风反革命集团的“文艺活动”，就是这样同国民党特务机关协和配合的。根据不久前才知道的材料，在抗日战争时期，国民党特务机关把当时重庆革命的、进步的文艺阵营中的人士分为“共党派”，“接近共党派”。这些都是他们“打击”“调查”的“工作对象”，而胡风则是属于“工作为工作对象”的那一类。现在真象很明白，当然用不着多加解释。已经为国民党特务机关工作得很好的胡风和胡风集团，既在“打击”又在“调查”革命和进步的文艺阵营中的人士，而且同特务有密切联系，彼此都知道得很清楚，还有什么必要当作“工作对象”呢？
    解放以后一九五一年胡风又来四川，“参加”土地改革工作。在实际工作中，胡风卫护的是地主，打击的是农民。土地改革工作告一段落，胡风回到重庆，在文联的一次会议上讲话，劝人们不要去暴露封建土地制度和地主阶级的罪恶，而应该去写什么“农民精神上的负担”；不要去歌颂英雄，模范，党员，而应去写什么“他们之外的其他人物”。我们当时批驳了这种谬论，但仍然是把他当作朋友来批评的，虽然这种“朋友”是十分令人奇怪的。现在真象已明，当然没有丝毫可以奇怪的地方，把刀锋始终对着人民，对着共产党，对着革命阵营，这正是一切花言巧语所不能遮盖的。胡风反革命集团在人民阵营隐藏了这样长久的时间，直到最近才被揭发出来，而在成都的胡风集团分子，还是在全国已经揭发出来以后才被发现的，这个事实证明我们的政治警惕性十分不够。我们必须清除一切暗藏在人民阵营内的反革命分子、决不能同老虎睡在一起。胡风是四川选出的全国人民代表大会代表。现在揭去了假脸，原形暴露出来，他是一个暗藏的反革命分子，是人民的死敌。我们选举过他的人有权行使自己的权利，撤销他的全国人民代表大会代表的资格。宪法第十九条规定镇压一切叛国的和反革命的活动，惩办一切卖国贼和反革命分子。胡风这个极端仇恨人民坚决同人民为敌的反革命分子，应当按照国法加以惩办。从揭露胡风反革命集团的材料可以看出，敌人对我们已经取得的胜利是死不甘心的、对正在进行的社会主义建设和社会主义改造是要疯狂破坏的。只要反革命分子能够隐藏一天，他们就要破坏一天。提高政治警惕，善于辨别伪装的敌人，这是我们从胡风事件应该吸取的最重要的教训。
    胡风及其它反革命分子逃不出人民巨掌
    乔传珏
    “人民日报”最近连续揭发的关于胡风反革命集团的材料（尤其是第三批材料），完全证实了胡风反革命集团反党、反人民、反革命的罪行。
    胡风反革命集团是一批有组织、有纲领、有策略的披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，企图从革命内部破坏革命事业的最阴险、最毒辣的敌人。他们中许多人很早以来就同帝国主义国民党特务机关有着密切的联系，是帝国主义、国民党的忠实走狗。二十多年来，他们长期地伪装革命，混进革命队伍，以两面派的手法，有策略地使用“钻进肚皮去”的战术，企图从政治上、思想上，最后从组织上来瓦解人民的革命军队，破坏中国共产党的领导，破坏中国人民革命的胜利。对这样坚决的反革命分子，必须给以法律制裁。因此我衷心拥护全国人民对胡风反革命集团的声讨，并建议撤销反革命分子胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格和他的一切职务，依法严办！
    胡风反革命集团钻进革命队伍进行反革命活动的事实，说明了随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的进展，随着阶级斗争的日益尖锐化，帝国主义和国民党残余匪帮一定要千方百计地进行破坏活动。如果我们的政治嗅觉不敏锐，革命警惕性不高，就会使反革命分子的阴谋活动得逞，使革命事业遭受损失。如果我们不努力学习，加强锻炼，加强依靠共产党的领导的观念，不断地提高社会主义觉悟，并善于察明真伪，辨别是非，就有可能上反革命分子的当，堕入他们的圈套而不自觉。因此，我们每一个人都应当提高政治嗅觉和革命警惕性，只有这样才能够洞察出暗藏在革命队伍中的反革命分子，不受其欺骗和迷惑。
    我们作为一个同知识分子有着紧密联系的中国民主同盟的成员，应当努力学习马克思列宁主义理论，提高马克思列宁主义思想水平，继续认真学习中国共产党四中全会的决议，更加紧密地依靠中国共产党的领导，加强盟的团结，经常向个人主义、自由主义、个人英雄主义等资产阶级思想展开斗争，反对不关心政治的思想倾向，划清唯心主义同唯物主义的思想界限，逐步扩大社会主义思想阵地，在祖国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中，贡献出更多的力量。当前应积极参加对胡风反革命集团的斗争，坚决地把胡风集团和一切反革命分子从革命队伍中清除出去。
    我们革命的力量是强大的，人民群众是具有丰富的斗争经验和对于反革命分子的辨别能力的。因而不管胡风分子和类似的反革命分子以任何手法进行反革命活动，终究是逃不出人民的巨掌的。
    不让反革命集团有藏身的余地
    王统照
    “关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”的公布，使我们更加清楚地看到了胡风集团的政治背景。他们同帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切联系，长期伪装，潜藏在人民内部干着反革命的勾当。胡风与其喽啰们所以对人民革命政权、对党的同志与党外的进步作家，对我们的新事业，对掌握共产主义世界观，对思想改造，对深入工农兵群众一概反对、抗拒、破坏、肆口毒骂，那股深仇宿恨般的表现，啊，原来都是用以破坏人民革命政权的手段！
    这还有什么说的，还有什么疑问，还有什么曲辞的辩解！
    把革命力量看作是“枯黄的叶子”和“腐朽的尸体”；把我们镇压反革命的伟大斗争诬为“封建潜力正在疯狂的杀人”；把我们训练干部的方法认作是“和希相去无几”；把全国解放后蓬蓬勃勃的文艺界说成“在文艺这一领域，几乎没有一块干净的土地”。胡风组织他的党徒分别写信给党中央，“控告”文艺界党的负责同志等等，不须多引，胡风与其集团分子的用心，真是昭然、显然，其为有组织的特务行动，阅者都能看出。
    这个阴险密谋的事件经揭发后，不单使我们有共同的愤怒，更使我们因此事件受到深切的教训。我们要把一切潜藏的伪装的反革命分子从我们的队伍中予以清除。自然，这不是专指的文艺界，在机关、团体、任何地方，我们都不能不倍加警惕，不让反革命分子有藏身的余地！
    我们有中国共产党的正确领导，反革命分子无论如何鬼祟、阴毒、巧装、多变，但他们总逃不出人民的眼睛与大家的辨识。不过，我们却先要自己十分坚强，吸取教训，分清敌我，不要麻痹、松懈，使反革命分子有机可乘，进行活动！
    至于对胡风与其集团分子的处理，今天看到“人民日报”上邓初民同志的几条提议，我完全赞同。
    “如果敌人不投降——消灭他！”
    萧三
    病中很吃力地看了关于胡风反动集团的一批又一批的材料，也就是对这个集团狰狞面目的一层又一层的揭露，我真气得头脑欲裂，无论如何也不能平静下来。
    看胡风那些阴险、毒辣、无耻的“私房话”，真“得忍受生理上的厌恶才行”。最可恨的是他一面假惺惺地“顺着”马克思、列宁、毛泽东、共产党；一面却恶毒地污蔑党和党的文艺方针，猖狂到竟称毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”为“图腾”。就只凭这些，大家来判断吧：胡风不正是隐藏在革命队伍中的“强盗和骗子”吗？不正是“无法当作人看待的”“畜生”吗？！
    自从我们的报刊和文化艺术界展开批判胡风思想以来，胡风突然变得对人特别客气起来了。不久以前，我在北京医院碰着他，他也去“治病”。走过去了他还回头来给我握手。我因病重没站起来，也没答话。谁知道他那是“用微笑包着侮蔑”和我们“握手言欢”。他的那只手是拿着“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”的手，是拿“集束手榴弹”攻击我们的手，也是指挥他的集团分子向党和党所领导的文艺战线发动猖狂进攻，运用各种战术，打进党内来偷窃文件、探听情况的手！
    胡风反党集团直到今天还想“在……洞中多待”，“求得重生”，等他们的好时机。但人民却要照高尔基说的去做：“如果敌人不投降——消灭他！”
    我苦于脑病，思想很难集中和多说话，但只要还有一口气，我就要同大家一道声讨这种人类的渣滓、外国帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮残余势力的别动队、人民的可耻叛徒！
    同豺狼一道共处了二十年
    沙汀
    读了“人民日报”揭发胡风及其反革命集团罪行的第三批材料，我感到非常愤怒，同时脑子里不住反复着这样一个念头：我们同豺狼一道共处了二十年。
    像其他一些同志一样，我也不是对胡风毫无认识的，我老早就感觉胡风很不老实，爱耍手段，而且非常阴险狡猾。但是在他的反革命活动没有暴露以前，我就很少进一步想一想，他对党对人民对革命，是否同样爱耍手段，同样很不老实？
    我还记得，抗日战争以前，我曾经向一个同志谈过这样糊涂的话，“幸而是文艺界，胡风如果把他这一套搬到政治上去，他早就出鬼了！”从这里可以看出，当时自己认识多么模糊，好像我们的文艺战线并不是整个革命的一部分，可以容忍任何反革命的破坏活动。
    单就“左联”时期胡风给予当时革命文艺战线造成的损害来看，我认为胡风的罪恶也是不可以饶恕的。这些损害，每一个参加当时“左联”活动的党内党外同志，都会记得很清楚的。他一贯一方面兴风作浪，破坏团结；一方面拉拉扯扯，“加强实力”。如果谁认真在那里为革命工作，不愿意向他胡风靠拢，他就千方百计地加以打击排挤。
    从揭发的材料来看，胡风当时的反革命目的，已经非常明确，那就是瓦解革命文艺战线，使它变质！我记得很清楚，虽然绝大多数同志坚持了斗争，但由于胡风经常在“左联”内部阴谋制造种种人事纠纷，有的正派同志甚至消极下来，不愿意干“左联”的工作了，跑到外地去埋头写作。有的不愿意住在上海。一九三四年夏天，我自己也被胡风制造的流言蜚语弄得很苦，结果跑到青岛去住了两三个月。
    对于胡风的政治背景，我们也是老早怀疑过的。“左联”时期，大家都纷纷转入地下，胡风却照旧可以在国民党的中山文化教育馆工作，这件事我们就感觉有些奇怪。抗日战争时期，胡风又在重庆李子坝国民党大特务王芃生主持的国防宣传处工作过，这也不是没有人知道的。但是，尽管知道，尽管也怀疑过，但都从来没有认真加以追究；也没有当成一个严重问题，向党反映，这证明自己对待革命利益多么不够关心！
    一九四六年前后，胡风反革命集团把我当成客观主义的典型大肆谩骂。但当我一九四六年夏天从乡下到重庆参加文协分会的工作时，因为一般同志都主张“不要抵消力量”，我还通过同胡风有联系的卢鸿基同阿垅在文协见过一面。这个国民党特务头子，当时也引起过我的怀疑，因为他的打扮说明他是一个反动派高级军官，问起来呢，他自己又说正在山洞“陆军大学”研究班学习……
    由于党的英明领导，群众的勇敢揭发，胡风和他的反革命集团的丑恶面目，终于被揭露了。这是我们国家和人民的一个巨大胜利；但是，我相信，每一个从前错误地认为胡风还可以争取的同志看了材料都会大吃一惊的。从胡风事件中我们应吸取教训，提高认识，做一个政治嗅觉灵敏，具有充分阶级警惕性的革命战士。
    这里我记起一件旧事来了。一九三九年我由延安回到重庆，住在南岸铜元局裕华农场宋之的同志家里。几天过后，之的同志拿了一封信给我看，是胡风写的，托他向我约稿；说：老沙是从延安来的，“七月”登了他的文章，他胡风将来在革命法庭受审判罪可能轻些……。对于不合己意的人，胡风一贯尖酸刻薄，这是大家都知道的，所以当时我也并不怎么在意。现在回想起来，他那里是讽刺我呢，他是在讽刺革命；因为十分明显，在胡风眼睛里，中国人民永远不会站起来的，卖国贼蒋介石也不会倒下去！
    但是，胡风！你这个狐狸和豺狼的混血儿，你的龌龊打算早破产了！而且，人民的革命法庭，决不会宽恕你的！也不会容许你作任何抵赖！你二十年来的全部反革命罪行将是惩罚你的根据。
    严惩胡风！彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团！
    不要给反革命分子钻空子
    范瑞娟　傅全香　徐玉兰
    我们看到“人民日报”上发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料后，心中充满无比的愤怒。我们完全同意彻底揭露和清算胡风集团的反党、反革命、反人民的罪行，并要求对那些执迷不悟的首恶分子依法严办。
    从第三批材料所揭露的事实中可以看出，胡风集团的基本骨干，是埋伏在我们革命队伍中的特务分子、反动军官和托洛茨基分子。他们的主子就是帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮。他们奉了主子的命令，以种种阴险毒辣的手段从事政治阴谋活动，妄图从内部破坏和瓦解我们的革命事业。
    从胡风事件中，我们得到了深刻的教训。我们这些文艺工作者，由于过去缺乏理论学习和思想锻炼，因此小资产阶级思想和自由主义情绪还相当严重。这次看到反革命分子竟利用我们某些干部的自由主义而钻空子时，真使我们大吃一惊。通过胡风事件的揭露，不仅使我们认识到阶级斗争的复杂和尖锐，更使我们提高了警惕，从而进一步检查自己。我们今后应当努力学习马克思列宁主义理论，提高政治觉悟，明辨是非，只有这样才不至于为反革命分子所欺骗和蒙蔽。
    我们也认识到，胡风反革命集团的被清算，是我国人民政治斗争中的一个重大胜利。不管胡风分子多么狡猾，采取什么样的策略，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，反革命分子终于逃不脱人民的法网。我们要求继续追查一切胡风分子，并要他们老老实实交代，我们决不允许怙恶不悛的反革命分子逍遥法外。
    必须将反革命分子斩草除根
    赖少其
    看了“人民日报”揭露的胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，上海美术工作者感到无比愤怒。胡风反革命集团的骨干就是帝国主义和国民党特务分子、反革命军官、托洛茨基分子、革命叛徒、自首变节分子。他们是人民的死敌，他们仇恨人民和革命，是深入骨髓的。他们进攻人民革命力量是要“一不做，二不休”。我们如果对于反革命分子还讲忠厚宽容，那便是对于人民的残忍。
    中国人民取得今天的胜利是用多少革命先烈的鲜血和头颅换来的啊！胡风反革命集团切齿憎恨我们的胜利，坚决地同人民为敌，千方百计地要瓦解革命的政权，用阴谋毒辣的手段钻进革命内部，企图从内部来篡夺人民的政权。这是我们的不共戴天之仇！我们对于反革命分子应该坚决予以镇压，这样才对得起革命的先烈。
    这伙反革命分子不仅钻进了革命队伍内部，而且还钻进了中国共产党党内。他们本来便是反革命分子，他们老早就是共产主义的凶恶敌人，应该对这些敌人依法惩办。
    胡风反革命集团的罪恶是十分清楚了，像胡风那样以两面派手法混进我们革命队伍中的其他反革命分子，我们一定也要肃清他们。我们必须百倍提高政治警惕，加强马克思主义的学习，加强人民内部的团结，彻底肃清一切反革命分子。我们不能再同老虎睡在一起了，对于暗藏的反革命活动，我们的政治警惕性实在太差了，我们应该提高警惕！
    向胡风反革命集团坚决斗争
    马加
    看了“人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，我更加气愤，更加清醒。
    这个胡风反革命集团不仅同革命“毫无此种姻缘”，就是做一个中国的公民，凭他们那种“对这个社会秩序，我憎恨”的态度，也是没有资格的。
    我们都有一些社会知识，究竟什么人能在江西“剿共”军中做反共的政治工作，什么人能在胡宗南的“战干四团”做少校军事教官，什么人能在“中美合作所”任职，什么人能实行倒算、逼死农民，什么人有资格去“恳托”那个“北平警局长”的特务头子，难道还不明白吗？如果不是“中字方面”的，怎能“因国军频频收复”，觉得“人心已定”？怎能因“新的风暴起来”，“希望能迎接苦难”？国民党反动派对解放区的疯狂进攻，对人民是一种绝大的灾难，他们却认为“人心已定”。不用说，我们的胜利，也就是他们的灾难。我们高高兴兴建设社会主义社会，他们却觉得“对这个社会秩序，我憎恨”。我们有了人民民主专政制度，我们有了人民的宪法，对于真正的人，劳动者和公民，自然是尊重的，而他们却说“人还是污损人的”。是的，有一点他们说对了，对于那些在“中美合作所”“战干四团”“剿共”军中干过不可告人的勾当的，以及倒算逼死农民的“人”，我们一定要“污损”、镇压。假如对这些“人”宽大，那末，就是对于真正的劳动者和公民的“污损”。他们的反革命行动还不严重么？难道还能让他们到台湾那里去听“训话”，得到“鼓舞”么？难道还让他们在农民的头上翻把倒算么？他们有许多“阴暗的聪明”，这“聪明”使我们吃了许多亏。我们知道同革命“毫无此种姻缘”的人，只能对蒋介石“忠贞”，对“中美合作所”“忠贞”，我们对他们则应该毫不姑息地给以镇压！
    一齐动员，粉碎胡风反革命集团
    刘英源
    胡风反革命集团第三批材料的公布，使人再也没有一丝怀疑地相信：这个集团的骨干完完全全、彻头彻尾是美蒋特务匪徒。怪不得他们那样“憎恨”我们，“憎恨”我们“这个社会秩序”，丧心病狂地要把我们“这个社会秩序”搞“垮台”。他们原来是按着它们主子，颠覆人民政权的指示，向我们进攻的。
    和所有美蒋特务一样，凶狠、毒辣的胡风匪徒们也施展了无孔不入，无机不投的卑鄙手段，钻入我们共产党内，政府和各人民团体内，窃取机密，发展组织，篡夺领导权，建立反革命据点，阴谋一枪不放地毁坏我们“这个社会秩序”。多么疯狂呵！
    告诉胡风匪徒们，和你们主子悲惨失败的下场一样，你们永远地“办”不到你们所妄想的“人与人没有矛盾”的蒋匪专制的复辟。彻底的灭亡，这就是你们真正的下场。
    胡风匪徒们能够混进一些领导部门，窃取领导权，当然也一定会同其他美蒋特务密切联系，发展组织，建立“阵地”，一块破坏我们。他们能够盗窃党内密件，当然也一定能盗窃更多的国家机密情报，献给他们的美蒋主子。因之请求政府：必须彻底追查匪徒们的叛国罪行。
    我们工人和全国人民一齐动员一齐下手，向胡风反革命匪徒展开围攻，一定要把潜藏在工人队伍中的伪装的反革命的分子，彻底剿灭。我们决不能让胡风匪徒们再逍遥法外，危害我们工人阶级和全国人民。我代表工人同志要求政府，依照“惩治反革命条例”的规定，给胡风匪徒以严厉制裁，坚决镇压反革命。
    要百倍地提高革命警惕性
    赵国有
    我读过在报纸上揭发反革命分子胡风及其反革命集团的罪恶行为的一批、二批及其有关的材料后，就激起万分的愤恨；到读了第三批材料后，更加清楚地看到胡风反革命分子及其反革命集团中的骨干分子，真是和蒋介石一模一样是反动透顶的。从第三批密信中，铁证如山地证明，胡风集团是同国民党特务头子有着密切联系的，这个集团的骨干是由“中美合作所”的特务、恶霸地主、国民党反动军官组成的，是直接为蒋介石及其主子帝国主义效劳的。扒开披着马克思主义外皮的胡风反革命分子及其反革命集团分子的皮，暴露出来他们的反动的本质，这是我们对阶级敌人斗争的一大胜利。我们一定要坚决地镇压反革命分子胡风及其反革命集团中的骨干分子，彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团。胡风反革命集团是个极端阴险的反革命的集团。他们不仅善于采用“橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”和“集束手榴弹的战法”，来向党、向人民、向革命进行猖狂地进攻，而且善于采用“挖心战”，“深入到”我们“肝脏里面”来“装死躺下”，等待时机，决心同我们打一年冲锋。他们这套狡猾毒辣的手段，极易把政治理论水平不高，嗅觉不灵的人欺骗住。如果不把胡风及其反革命集团的皮扒开来，许多人就很难看出胡风及其集团的罪恶的本质。
    我们要百倍地提高革命警惕性，学会对狡猾敌人的斗争，彻底地把暗藏在各个角落的胡风分子及一切暗藏着的反革命分子彻查出来，特别在工人阶级内部更要肃清胡风分子及其恶毒的影响。任何麻痹大意，在复杂的阶级斗争中丧失革命的警惕性，都是反革命分子进行活动的空隙，必须从胡风事件取得教训。
    接受胡风反革命集团事件的教训
    邵象华
    “人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，把这个危害国家危害人民的反革命组织的真相和政治背景，清清楚楚地揭露出来了。读了这些材料使我非常愤恨。我从来没有读过胡风集团的文章。在批判胡风思想开始时，我们以为是一个文艺思想问题，可能他们只是一些个人主义野心分子罢了。但“人民日报”发表的材料确凿地证明，胡风和胡风反革命集团中的许多骨干分子原来都是同帝国主义蒋介石有密切联系的反革命分子。看啊，在全国解放以前，他们为蒋介石对革命力量“三个月可以击破主力，一年肃清”的“自信”而感到“更为鼓舞”，“充满了乐观”。当他们的主子蒋介石在人民解放军面前不断溃败，全国人民为自己的解放而欢腾的时候，他们却看作是“苦难”。全国解放以后，他们并不甘休，制定了向党和人民进攻的最毒辣最狡猾的策略和计划。我要求将胡风等首恶分子在国家和其他工作部门中的一切职务撤销，并将他们依法严惩。
    胡风反革命集团的揭露，再次证明了反革命分子是经常企图混入革命队伍来从内部进行破坏活动的。我想，胡风集团虽在文艺界发现，但反革命活动决不只限于文艺界。特别是重工业这样建设社会主义的重要环节，反革命分子是决不会放松的。因此，在重工业企业中的每一个人，更需要加倍提高警惕，揭露和清除胡风反革命集团分子。对于科学技术工作者来说，更应该接受这一教训，我们有些人政治嗅觉是很不灵敏的。钻研科学技术忘记了政治，在目前还不能说是个别现象。我想，这样的人是最容易同老虎睡在一起而不自觉的，也有可能成为反革命分子发展组织的对象。胡风分子不就以“自由主义”作为“可一试”的对象条件吗？因此我们科学技术工作者应该加强自我改造，学习马克思列宁主义，提高自己的思想水平和政治水平，时刻同一切暗藏的危害社会主义建设事业的反革命分子作坚决斗争。

    从“人民日报”陆续发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，我们很清楚地知道了这个反革命集团是有组织、有纲领、有计划的反革命集团。他们披着马克思主义外衣，伪装着革命，扮作进步人士，隐藏在革命队伍内，暗地里却干着反党反人民的罪恶勾当。从关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料内也知道了这一群反革命分子是什么样的人，他们早已同蒋介石卖国集团及帝国主义者有密切的联系。这个集团中的基本骨干是国民党的特务、军事教官、地主还乡团、和血债累累的反革命分子，他们是蒋介石匪帮和帝国主义者的忠实走狗。这一伙反革命分子，对解放后的新社会，对人民革命政权表现了刻骨的仇恨，他们想尽一切办法进行破坏活动，企图颠覆新中国的人民民主政权。但这一伙反革命分子却忘记了新中国是由久经考验的中国共产党和毛主席领导的，共产党是无战不胜的。这一伙反革命分子现在在人民面前显露了原形，这是党和人民在对敌斗争中所取得的又一次胜利。我是钢铁厂的职工，我们全体职工正在夜以继日地为建设社会主义的祖国而忘我地劳动，但这一批反革命分子却阴险地干着反革命活动，我们痛恨这批反革命分子，要求政府立即撤销他们的一切职务，并坚决地镇压他们，把这一堆垃圾清理出去。同时我们全体职工也要加紧学习马克思列宁主义，提高自己的政治觉悟，学会同暗藏的反革命分子作斗争的本领。最近我们厂在业余学校逮捕了一个反革命分子，他来厂后不好好工作，挑拨干部的关系，开始时领导上认为他只是思想有毛病，对他进行了教育，但没有效果。嗣后经过详细调查才发现他是反革命分子。所以我们企业的工作者，特别是领导者，应该时刻提高警惕，严防一切暗藏的反革命分子破坏我们的胜利果实。我们要为完成国家给予的任务而奋斗，我们要坚决地粉碎胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子的阴谋。
    严厉镇压胡风反革命集团
    陈恒义
    读了“人民日报”揭发胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，我真是怒发冲冠。胡风和胡风集团中许多骨干分子很早就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，他们同帝国主义特务机关也有密切联系。他们对解放后的新社会、对人民革命政权表现了刻骨的仇恨，他们憎恨新社会，梦想人民革命“灭亡”、“完蛋”。他们在全国解放后，不断地秘密计议向党和人民猖狂进攻，千方百计地打入共产党内，窃取党内文件，探听党内情报，里应外合地从事各种反革命活动。从他们以上种种反革命事实来看，我们清楚地认识到这些卑鄙而阴险的敌人是多么恶毒。
    二十年来，胡风的枪口就一直指向共产党，指向革命阵营。他们组织力量，建立据点，不断地进行罪恶的活动。胡风这一批反革命分子的真面目到今天已经彻底弄清楚了，我们绝对不容许他们继续在我们革命队伍里进行阴谋破坏活动。我要求根据“惩治反革命条例”严厉惩办这批反革命分子。我们不彻底铲除一切暗藏的反革命分子，决不罢休！
    在这次揭发胡风反革命事件中，我充分地认识到在建设社会主义社会的过渡时期中阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性。对胡风反革命阴谋活动的斗争，是我们英明的共产党领导全国人民在革命战线上又一次的重大胜利。但是敌人企图破坏我们的阴谋活动决不就此为止，因此我们医务工作者必须百倍地提高警惕，努力加强马克思主义的学习，紧密地团结，积极投入揭露胡风反党集团罪行的斗争。只有这样，才能保证我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利完成。
    反革命的罪行必须受到应有的惩处
    彭仰钦
    前两次所揭露的胡风集团反革命活动材料，他们的罪恶已经够使人愤恨，而第三批材料更进一步地证明了这个反动集团的骨干分子是十足的特务间谍、人民的敌人。我们要求政府按照惩治反革命条例，严厉惩办这个反革命集团的首恶分子胡风以及坚决同人民为敌的阿垅、绿原等骨干分子，彻底粉碎这个反革命集团。
    胡风的反党反革命集团是非常狡猾的。他们表面自称“进步作家”，暗地里却仇视党，仇视进步作家，仇视人民，仇视革命的胜利，想将解放了的劳动人民拖回到原来的饥饿贫困环境中去。稍有人性的人决不可能也决不愿意这样作的。
    今天以胡风为首的反革命集团分子的真正的丑恶面目被揭露了。绿原是“中美合作所”的特务。阿垅是国民党的军官。单从这样两个家伙过去所作事情来看，就可说明他们政治背景和后台老板是谁。
  “中美合作所”是美蒋专门屠杀革命志士、进步群众的特务组织。牺牲在“中美合作所”的同志和无辜的同胞不知有多少，这笔血债是无法估计的。我们要追查绿原等的问题。对其从犯，除掉彻底坦白交代的人以外，其余也应给以应得的法律处分。
    我们要万分提高警惕，加强马克思主义理论的学习，为坚决粉碎这个反党、反革命集团，保卫人民的胜利果实而斗争！
    必须严办胡风
    欧阳山
    我在旅途中看到报上所公布的胡风反革命集团的两批材料之后，感到无比的愤怒。胡风这样的丧心病狂，这样的卑劣无耻，是不能当做人来看待的。这是奸细，是特务，是披了人皮的恶鬼！
    郭沫若先生说得好：我们以前是太马虎了，一直把胡风当成为友人，真可以说是和豺狼一道睡觉。当然，我们在思想上同胡风是敌对的。但是我们没有认识到：为什么一个号称参加革命阵营二十多年的人，竟会一直保持着同党敌对的思想。我们固然反对胡风的“主观战斗精神”论，反对胡风拿资产阶级唯心主义和个人主义来腐蚀人民群众，反对胡风对党的领导、对党和非党作家的污蔑和挑拨，但是他为什么要这样做呢？我们还是弄不清楚的。他主张“主观战斗精神”，那对他有什么好处呢？他要拿资产阶级唯心主义和个人主义来腐蚀人民群众，那对他有什么好处呢？他要污蔑党的领导，挑拨党和非党作家的关系，那对他有什么好处呢？我们还是弄不清楚的。我们还像一个老老实实的人那样子在想：“怎么会是这个样子的呢？那分明只是对敌人有利呀！”
    可不正是如此！可不恰好如此！到这个时候，我们才明白了：原来跟我们争论的人，他本身就是敌人。他甚至不是什么小资产阶级、大资产阶级，也不是什么文艺家、野心家，他要比这些干脆得多，明了得多。他就是敌人。他要是不做对敌人有利的事情，那才奇怪！到这个时候，我们才明白了：为什么在上海和重庆的时候，革命作家被抓的被抓，被杀的被杀，他却在国民党的反动政权里保持着公开的职业。他不但不是什么革命家；并且也不是什么文艺家。他的真用意，是要破坏我们的党，是要破坏我们的革命政权，是要破坏我们整个美好无比的社会主义前途。
    这个豺狼，这个恶鬼，他的本事虽小，他的阴谋却大得可笑。他还幻想着反革命政权的复辟。他还想用挖心战、钻心战来对待我们。他还在磨剑。他还在给我们准备一个他想像中的渣滓洞，准备到那一天，他就用橡皮裹着钢丝的鞭子来“款待”我们。好呀，让他们试试看吧。中国人民是这样好欺负的？我们有人民民主专政的政权，我们有公安机关，我们有法院，一切奸细和特务都有他应该去的地方。我们必须严办胡风！我们必须保护我们全体人民，不让胡风的橡皮钢丝鞭子损害我们一根毫毛！
    胡风反党、反人民、反革命集团的人们必须赶快站出来向人民坦白，立功赎罪。我们全体人民也必须提高警惕，绝不能让任何胡风集团的坏分子和任何反革命奸细特务钻进我们的肚皮里面来！
    把胡风反革命黑帮连根拔除
    徐光耀
    肮脏恶臭的胡风反革命集团的实质，现在是真相大白了。
    从胡宗南的“战干四团”和“重庆山洞陆军大学”来的，从江西“剿共”军反共政治机关来的，从“中美合作所”来的，从反攻倒算的恶霸地主群里来的……胡风集团里的骨干，就是这样的一群。
    怪不得他们用“集束手榴弹”，原来是蒋介石、胡宗南手下的战术教官在指挥着；怪不得他们用“橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”，原来是美国帝国主义和蒋介石的“中美合作所”传授的；怪不得他们对“钻进肚皮”、深入“肝脏”、躺下“装死”……等等策略运用得那么纯熟，原来是从江西“剿共”匪军中学来的。他们的反革命罪恶活动已经有二十年的历史了。
    感谢党的英明领导，党用智慧的洞察一切的眼睛，看穿了这个大骗局，使蛇精和九尾狐无地藏身，使我们大悟而警醒起来。党使我们在跟凶恶的暗藏敌人的斗争中，又取得一次伟大的胜利！
    然而，斗争还在发展，战果必须扩大。胡风等这一群反革命恶鬼既是那么长期“坚韧”地培植他们的“群众基础”，就不能不在各种地方扎下他们的根子。我们解放军，更应百倍警惕。我们不能设想：像他们这样一个匪徒集团，会对武装不感兴趣。事实已经证明有某些胡风分子已经混入了部队。这是我们决不能疏忽的。我们一定要追查。不管什么样的反革命分子，我们都不能跟他们睡在一起。为了保证革命的人民队伍的高度纯洁，对胡风反革命黑帮的大大小小的根子，都必须坚决地连根拔除！
    再不能麻痹了
    唐克新
    “人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，以铁一般的事实证明了胡风反革命集团是一个一贯反党、反人民、反革命的集团，是蒋介石的忠实走狗，是人民的死敌。这个混进革命队伍的反革命集团的真面目现在终于被彻底弄清了！
    其实胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动，有许多地方是非常明显的，只是我们太麻痹了。胡风集团一贯地用他们的“文章”对革命政权、共产党和共产党的政策，尽其咒骂和嘲笑的能事，以损害共产党和人民政府的威信。可是，仍旧有一些过分“天真”的人，总好像觉得“文艺”这个名词同反革命这个名词连不起来。那些幼稚的人想：“用文艺怎么能反革命呢？”敌人要比这些人“聪明”得多，他们就找到了“文艺”这个最好的防空洞。于是，蒋介石的特务、反动军官混进来了，他们打着文艺的幌子，宣传反革命的理论，散播对共产党和人民政府的不满，企图最后颠覆人民政权。
    正如“人民日报”社论所指出：“我们的很多人对于暗藏的反革命分子，警惕性是不高的，许多人简直丧失了警惕性。”在我们工厂里，如果发现被反革命分子破坏了一架机器，我们就紧张起来了！可是，对胡风这样一个大规模的反革命集团的反革命活动，我们不少人却认为“这只是文艺界的事，他们不会跑到我们的工厂里来破坏我们的机器，同我们没啥大关系。”却不知道胡风反革命集团正在挖我们的社会主义的根基。这是一个多么可怕的麻痹思想！为了巩固革命政权，为了保卫社会主义的事业，为了对六万万人民负责，我要求政府坚决、彻底地肃清胡风反革命集团，并依法严厉惩办胡风、阿垅等怙恶不悛的反革命首恶分子！
    坚决清除胡风及其反革命集团
    于非闇
    胡风及其反革命集团的问题，不仅仅是主观唯心主义的思想问题，也不仅仅是所谓要篡夺党对文艺的领导权的问题。很明显，胡风是彻头彻尾的反革命的特务头子。他的反革命集团，是暗藏在我们人民内部秘密进行颠覆活动的一股“别动队”；他们是人民的公敌，必须坚决地把他们镇压下去。
    在我们对反革命头子胡适进行批判的同时，我们也读到了“胡风对文艺问题的意见”，在胡风那六条纲领中，所谓“五把刀子”外，他还妄自主张取消党对文艺的统一领导。在政治警惕性太低、呆头呆脑的我看来，只认为胡风的问题，仅仅是主观唯心主义、“自我扩张”的个人主义之类的思想问题，并不像胡适那样有反革命的政治背景。
    “人民日报”在五月里连续发表了关于胡风及其反革命集团的第一批第二批材料，这些材料揭露了胡风集团的真面目。胡风他们在背地里“争取人”“联络人”，用“集束手榴弹”决心打“冲锋”，但我仍认为他们不过妄图篡夺党对文艺的统一领导权。我在座谈会上发言，在刊物上写短文，毫不怀疑地根据着这一点点肤浅的认识，以为胡风及其反革命集团，仅仅属于文艺领域内的问题，并未深入研究。六月十日，“人民日报”发表了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，我抑制着愤恨把它读完了，只感到我不学无术，太幼稚了。胡风及其反革命集团，难道还只应认作是文艺领域内的问题吗？他们是特务集团，是人民的公敌！我要坚决地从头学起，必须学会善于辨别反革命分子的本领，深入地揭露他们的阴谋，保卫祖国。
    我们美术界一定和全国人民一道，坚决声讨胡风及其反革命集团。我们要求彻底追究胡风及其反革命集团的全部罪恶活动，依法惩治反革命“别动队”的头子胡风；对胡风集团中的反革命分子，也要分别情况，予以适当的处理。
    为彻底粉碎一切反革命集团而斗争
    艺术教育工作者欧阳予倩、熊佛西、刘开渠、沙可夫、吕骥、缪天瑞、贺绿汀、江丰、庞薰琹、李伯钊、郝寿臣、李长路等六十六人联名来信：“人民日报”前后发表了三批揭露胡风集团反革命活动的材料，这些材料清清楚楚地证实了胡风集团是帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮的忠实走狗，是中国人民最阴险最恶毒的死敌。
    这个反革命集团很早就同美、蒋特务机关有密切联系，他们把人民革命力量看作是“脓”，认为“总要排出”，他们反革命的态度非常坚决、是“一不做，二不休”的，他们的战术是企图“深入到”我们的“肝脏里面”。他们在全国解放后一切活动的总目的是使人民革命政权倒台和“完蛋”，让美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮重新爬到人民的头上来。
    我们是一群艺术教育工作者，看到了这些揭发出来的材料，引起了我们无比的愤怒和痛恨。我们坚决拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议开除胡风会籍及解除胡风一切职务的决议；我们要求迅速地撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并请政府依法惩处胡风及其反革命集团中有严重罪行的分子；我们要求胡风集团的党羽们老老实实向人民作彻底的交代，重新作人。
    我们要在党和毛主席的教导下，提高我们的革命警惕性，在我们的工作部门中彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，以纯洁我们的队伍。
    我们也由此得到教训，在今天阶级斗争尖锐的阶段，敌人对我们的进攻是越发猖狂了，敌人的破坏手段也更阴险、更狡猾。我们若再麻痹大意，就会对人民事业造成更大的损失。
    我们更清醒地认识到，加强马克思列宁主义理论的学习和不断地改造、提高自己的思想是如何的重要。
    我们信心百倍地在党和毛主席领导下为彻底粉碎一切反革命集团，为完成社会主义的建设事业而斗争。
    中国人民解放军总政治部文艺工作团全体工作人员来信：看了胡风和他的党羽们的几批密信，我们清楚地看见了胡风的狰狞面孔，我们再也按不住心中的极大愤怒，我们全体工作人员开了大会声讨胡风，并决议一致行动起来，捍卫我们新中国人民的文艺阵地，捍卫我们神圣的革命事业，彻底粉碎胡风反党反革命阴谋集团的猖狂进攻！
    我们是一群部队文艺工作者，从我们的亲身体验，证明党的文艺方针是无比正确的，毛主席的光辉著作“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”像一个光芒万丈的灯塔，照亮了我们前进的道路。我们绝不能容忍胡风反革命集团的任何污蔑，我们要战斗到底！胡风这样长期处心积虑地“扩展”他的阴谋集团的实力，对我们进行这样有组织有计划的猛烈进攻，决不是什么思想问题，而是一个严重的反革命的政治阴谋。
    我们要求依法惩办胡风。
    北京师范大学中国语言文学系锺敬文、黎锦熙、谭丕模、启功、刘盼遂等教职员工五十六人来信：我们记得很清楚：美蒋匪帮在“中美合作所”里，以最残酷的手段屠杀了我们无数的革命志士。原来胡风反革命集团中的骨干分子就是屠杀我们革命先烈的最凶狠最残暴的刽子手。我们以无比的愤恨，向我们的政府和全国人民，表示我们的态度，提出我们的要求：
    首先，我们坚决要求政府，依照惩治反革命条例，对胡风反革命集团分子，分别给以应有的处理。
    其次，我们坚决响应“人民日报”的号召，积极参加镇压胡风反革命集团的战斗。我们一定要用猛打穷追的精神，从各个方面来揭露胡风反革命集团大大小小的罪行，为彻底消灭胡风反革命集团而奋斗。同时，我们也一定接受这次教训，百倍地提高警惕，更加坚决彻底地消灭一切公开的和暗藏的反革命集团、反革命分子。
    胡风反革命集团的被揭露、被粉碎，是我们党和人民革命事业的一个伟大的胜利。从这里也使我们更深切地体会到，我们的党的确是战无不胜的，我们党所领导的伟大的中国人民是强大无敌的。我们深深地为我们的胜利而鼓舞。
    财政部税务总局全体工作人员来信：我们以无比愤怒的心情，阅读了“人民日报”及其他报刊上所揭载的关于胡风集团的材料。这些材料，提供了铁一般的证据，充分证明胡风和他的集团的骨干分子，很早以来，就是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有着密切联系的特务分子。对于胡风反革命集团种种卑劣阴险的勾当，我们认为必须加以彻底的清查，对胡风反革命集团，我们要求坚决予以镇压。
    胡风反革命集团事件，深深地教育了我们，使我们进一步认识到在过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性。那些被打倒或将被消灭的阶级，是决不会甘心于自己的死亡的，他们必然会利用每一机会来破坏我们党和人民的事业，企图使反动统治在中国复辟。我们和全国各界人民一样，一定要提高革命的警惕性，认清和揭发一切暗藏的阶级敌人，坚决地把他们从革命队伍中清除出去，如同保护眼珠一样，保卫我们伟大的社会主义建设事业。
    上海“文学讲座”全体听讲者一千四百零六人来信：胡风集团反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋罪行，现在已经揭露出来了。从“人民日报”已经公布出来的几批材料看，已经证明胡风集团是一个有组织的同帝国主义、国民党特务有密切联系的反革命组织。我们对于胡风和他的党羽们，披着马克思主义的外衣，用马克思主义的言辞来反对马克思主义，用拥护共产党的姿态来反对共产党的反革命毒辣罪行，表示最大的愤怒和痛恨。
    胡风和他的反党集团的党羽们，有很多是曾经被我们盲目崇拜过的“作家”，“诗人”，现在我们才算看到了他们的本来面目，他们要想危害人民，危害党和党所领导的人民文艺事业，他们是戴着假面具的暗藏的反革命分子，这次把他们的罪行揭露出来，是我们人民革命事业上的又一次伟大的胜利！我们一定积极参加这一场激烈的阶级斗争，为彻底肃清一切反革命分子而奋斗。
    青年团国家统计局工业部支部全体团员来信：“人民日报”公布了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料以后，激起了我们更大的愤怒，这批材料使我们更清楚地看到这些蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗的真实面目。他们在全国解放前，狂热地把希望寄托在蒋介石反人民的内战的胜利上，妄想“三个月可以击破”“一年肃清”我们伟大的中国人民解放军；他们对中国人民革命是表现了那样刻骨的仇恨，要求“一不做，二不休”地来扑灭中国人民的革命事业。解放以后，他们以更加阴险的两面派手法继续进行反革命活动。我们读了这些材料，万分地痛恨。我们要求人民法院立即逮捕反革命分子胡风和胡风集团中的骨干分子，依法严惩，并进行公审。我们一定要把他们一网打尽，不让一个胡风集团分子逃出人民的法网。
    北京电影演员剧团吴天、田方等一百四十七人来信：我们连续看了胡风反革命集团的罪恶材料，使我们愤怒万分！胡风的伪装被揭穿了，他是个最凶恶的反革命分子，阴险恶毒的阴谋家，一只满口利齿的豺狼。二十年来，胡风有纲领、有组织、有策略地向党向革命作疯狂的进攻。他们派遣坐探打入党内，分化瓦解革命队伍，打击诋毁党的领导，破坏革命事业。他们最终的目的是企图篡夺领导权，实行反革命复辟。胡风反革命集团是我们最凶恶的敌人！
    我们要求依法惩办胡风。并且要求彻底追查胡风反革命集团的一切罪行。
    北京第四中学全体教职员工来信：我们以最大的愤怒阅读了胡风反革命集团的第三批材料。我们要求进一步彻底追查胡风反革命集团同帝国主义和蒋贼的关系，坚决镇压胡风及其集团中至死不悟的首恶分子，并要求继续大张旗鼓地清除一切隐藏的胡风分子和其他反革命分子，坚决、彻底、干尽、全部地把他们肃清！我们告诉一切胡风分子：劳动人民的天下是定了的，新中国是不可动摇的，谁同人民为敌，他的下场就是粉身碎骨。
    这次事件给予我们的教训是深刻的。我们深深地认识到，不应对尖锐的阶级斗争持淡漠疏忽的态度，而应提高革命警惕性。社会主义建设的接连的胜利，敌人处境的绝望，使得他们必然要采取一切毒恶手段同革命作斗争。因此，我们必须系统地努力学习马克思列宁主义，特别要学习党同一切反党集团作斗争的经验，提高革命警惕性。
    我们认识到个人主义和自由主义思想对革命的严重危害性。我们的任何缺点和错误，特别是自由主义和个人主义，是敌人存在和扩大的适宜的土壤和空气。我们决心做堵洞工作，克服自己的一切非无产阶级思想，加强我们的思想建设。
    文化部人事司第一处全体工作同志来信：关于胡风反革命集团第三批材料的发表，揭穿了胡风集团的底细——他们中的骨干分子很早以来就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，同帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切的联系。他们在全国解放以前就长期地仇恨人民革命力量，把希望寄托在蒋介石反人民内战的胜利和人民革命力量的失败上。在我国大陆解放以后，胡风集团对人民政权表现了刻骨的仇恨，诅咒人民革命政权要“灭亡”“完蛋”。
    胡风反革命集团分子是用两面派的手法暗藏在革命团体内部、党的内部的。这些事实的教训，使我们深刻地认识到我们的警惕性是不高的。因此我们一定要加倍地提高我们的革命警惕性，只要我们真正提高了警惕性，加强了政治嗅觉，一切的反革命分子都会被我们辨别出来的！
    我们热爱我们的社会主义革命事业，绝不让反革命分子对它进行破坏。
    中国人民解放军某部文化教员陈建中来信：当我看到第三批关于胡风集团反党反人民材料的时候，我不能不回忆起在蒋介石匪帮统治的黑暗的年代里，还清楚地记得蒋匪所办的“中美合作所”，就是屠杀共产党员和进步人士的集中营。人们还清楚地记得，一九四九年，当人民革命胜利将要全面到来的时候，当重庆将要解放的前夕，重庆渣滓洞（即中美合作所）里，被反动派所逮捕的共产党员和进步人士，就在这个时候惨遭蒋匪特务屠杀了。他们是为了祖国的解放被蒋匪特务所杀害的。原来胡风集团就是谋杀这些爱国志士的刽子手之一。这笔血债人们是永不能忘记的。
    我再也不能压制我心中的愤慨了。我要控诉他们：现在正是胡风反革命集团偿还血债的时候了。
    河北师范学院历史系全体工会会员来信：我们读了“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”，大家都更加无比的愤恨。这一群万恶的反革命匪徒二十多年的血腥罪行，真令人发指。他们用阴险的手段，伪装革命，钻进了人民革命的阵营里来，进行反革命的破坏活动。现在我们已经揭穿了他们的画皮，我们决不能让胡风集团分子再胡作非为了。我们要求政府依法严惩胡风及其反革命集团中罪大恶极的骨干分子，彻底消灭他们，并继续肃清他们的恶毒影响。我们一定要百倍地提高警惕，同暗藏的一切反革命分子作斗争。
    河南省郑州林山寨洛阳工程局职工医院汪旭初来信：我是洛阳工程局职工医院的休养员。看了“人民日报”揭露胡风反革命集团的三批材料，激起极大的愤怒。胡风集团原来同美蒋特务有密切联系。我们要求立即逮捕反革命分子胡风，依法严惩。我们并警告胡风分子，你们应彻底向人民坦白罪行，否则，人民是不会宽恕你们的。
    河北省唐山市工会联合会祝学礼来信：现在，胡风集团的伪装，已经被完全揭穿了。
    这一伙帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮的忠实走狗，采取了阴险的两面派的手法，混到各个革命组织里边来。公开的是装做一副“进步”“老实”的面孔；暗地里却恶狠狠地进行着各种阴谋活动，咬牙切齿地咒骂着革命事业的“灭亡”和“完蛋”。
    胡风集团简直是一伙杀人不见血的凶犯，是我们的死敌！他们比狐狸还狡猾，比狼还狠毒！我们同这样的反革命分子誓不两立，一定要把胡风集团坚决、彻底、全部地消灭干净！
    党的七届四中全会教育我们：在社会主义改造时期，阶级斗争比过去更加尖锐、更加复杂，胡风事件使我具体地认识到四中全会决议的深刻意义。今后我们还可能遇到比胡风更加狡猾、更加狠毒的敌人。我们一定要擦亮眼睛，随时注意类似胡风的家伙，用我们的铁拳，把他们的阴谋粉碎。
    国务院对外文化联络局张其春、袁湘生、苏开明等十八人来信：我们是对外文化联络局的编译工作者，看到关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料以后，认为胡风集团的反革命罪恶决不止于此，我们必须继续追查。
    事实证明，胡风集团是一伙披着羊皮的豺狼，是一群坚决同人民为敌的潜藏在革命队伍中的特务分子。他们是有组织、有计划、有纲领、有战略、有战术的特务组织，企图从内部来破坏革命。我们决不能容忍这种特务分子逍遥法外。我们郑重地要求政府，尽速逮捕胡风和胡风集团的骨干分子，依法严办，并彻底搜查隐藏在各处的胡风分子，把危害人民的“胡”毒，彻底肃清。
    中国人民解放军某部杨德礼来信：狡猾阴险的胡风和胡风集团的反革命的真正面目，已经大白于天下了。原来这个集团早就同美、蒋特务机关有密切联系，是遵循着蒋介石的路线而活动的。无怪乎胡风集团对我们的党中央，对我们的党员作家和非党进步作家那样仇视，无怪乎胡风集团憎恨我们的社会制度，诅咒我们的革命政权“灭亡”“完蛋”。
    我们认为胡风集团一定还有更多的反革命罪行，因此，一定要进一步彻底清查胡风集团的一切反革命罪恶，对胡风及其集团中死不悔改的分子一定要依法严办。
    山东省海阳县十四区郭城村一个合作社社员于桂卿来信：当我从报上看到关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料时，我十分愤慨。因为我是一个爱好文艺和敬爱作家的人。胡风这只狼，披了人皮并且用马克思主义装修表面，好像很光亮。可他恶毒地以党为敌，现在原形毕露了。
    胡风想以他的牙爪咬杀革命，他想把党和人民从政治上推倒，这是使人最不能容忍的。尤其使我痛恨万分的是胡风作坏事，却写骗人的检讨。
    虚伪的东西破产了，假面具被揭穿了，这一卑鄙无耻的狼赤裸裸地露出来了。当我们在合作社内读到讨伐胡风的文稿时，人们都异口同声地说：“要他作什么，简直是祸害，快铲除吧！”
    我非常赞成快铲除他。人民辛勤劳动的果实，是供给为人民办事，为人民谋福利的人的，我们决不能让这样恶毒的人，再吃人民的粮食。
    铁道部华北设计局郭双元来信：我是一个工人。我和大家一样，对胡风反革命集团怀着极大的愤怒。我看到报纸上登载的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料以后，进一步认清了胡风反革命集团的本质。他们是美蒋特务机关的最忠实的走狗。可想而知，他们这些年来，干了多少狡猾罪恶的勾当。我要求政府把胡风及胡风集团分子的反革命事实一一彻底查明，并依法严惩。
    粮食部供应司廖顺益来信：看了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，使我进一步认清了胡风集团的真面目，原来他们是同国民党特务机关有着密切的联系，是为帝国主义、国民党匪帮服务的。他们的阴谋，是要推翻人民民主专政，他们是同人民的利益势不两立的。因此，我坚决要求政府将胡风及其集团中的顽固不化的死硬分子，逮捕法办，以保卫人民革命事业。
    北京前门区虎坊桥京华印书局韦祖辉来信：根据“人民日报”接连发表的三批材料看来，胡风反革命集团的反党、反人民、反革命的罪行已经铁证如山。我万分愤慨，我要求人民政府对胡风反革命集团予以坚决镇压。
    第三批材料，已经无可辩驳地证实了自称追随革命二十年的胡风及其集团的许多骨干分子，就是蒋贼的忠实走狗。这些基本骨干分子，原来是一些国民党特务、反动军官、托洛茨基分子、革命叛徒、自首变节分子。他们曾衷心拥护和参与了蒋贼发动的反人民的内战，诬蔑和仇视中国共产党、中国人民解放军。他们疯狂地仇恨中国人民的革命事业，企图推翻人民民主专政，使蒋介石卖国集团复辟。对这样仇视党，仇视人民，仇视革命的罪大恶极的反革命集团，我们能够宽恕吗？不，决不能。我要求：立即逮捕胡风和阿垅等罪大恶极的首要分子，依据法律予以惩办。
