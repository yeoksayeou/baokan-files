    Heighten Vigilance, Purge All Special Agents
  　Tu Changwang
      The three batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng Group published by the "People's Daily" have irrefutably confirmed that the Hu Feng Group is a gang of counter-revolutionaries closely linked to imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, an organized, programmatic, planned, and strategic special agent organization, and loyal running dogs of the US-Chiang special agents. No wonder they expressed such deep-seated hatred for the new society after liberation and the people's revolutionary regime, cursing the "demise" and "utter failure" of the people's revolutionary regime!
    Hu Feng elements have infiltrated many departments of our state organs and even the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party, which leads the Chinese revolution. They understand legal struggle and illegal struggle. They disguise themselves as progressive, wear the cloak of Marxism, but actually use all dark and despicable methods of division, winning over, rumor-mongering, deception, stealing documents, and spying for information, using two-faced and wolfish tactics to engage in subversive counter-revolutionary activities. We must resolutely and thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and purge all special agents. We propose that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress revoke Hu Feng's qualification as a representative of the National People's Congress, and request the government to severely punish the counter-revolutionary special agent ringleader Hu Feng in accordance with Article 19 of the Constitution. The Hu Feng elements and all other hidden counter-revolutionaries who are ferreted out must also be resolutely and appropriately dealt with according to law.
    At the same time, we must learn a lesson from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group incident: Now we realize that Hu Feng is not a cultural figure or a progressive writer, but a most insidious and vicious special agent ringleader. Many people in our revolutionary camp have been deceived by him for decades, always regarding him as a "friend" and "progressive writer." This shows how frighteningly low our political vigilance has fallen. We must heighten our vigilance, open our eyes, and learn to be good at distinguishing counter-revolutionaries, and resolutely struggle to purge the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all hidden special agents!
    Secondly, from this incident we should also recognize: In the transition period of building a socialist society, the class struggle is becoming more complicated and acute, which is by no means an empty phrase. We must not let victory go to our heads, become complacent, and lower our guard just because we have made some achievements in our work. We must strengthen our political study and improve our political and ideological level. Without conscientiously studying Marxism-Leninism and criticizing the bad ideological styles of the bourgeoisie such as "individualism," "liberalism," "sectarianism," and "double-dealing," it will be difficult to distinguish right from wrong, and it will be easy to be fooled by counter-revolutionaries, which will not only harm the revolutionary cause, but also cause oneself to fall into the mire of counter-revolution. We must always remember: Don't be too bookish and take the complicated class struggle too simply.
    We must heighten our vigilance, resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and defend the great victories we have achieved and will achieve.

    提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子
  　涂长望
      “人民日报”揭发胡风集团的三批材料，已经千真万确地证实了胡风集团是同帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的一群反革命分子，是一个有组织、有纲领、有计划、有策略的特务组织，是美蒋特务的忠实走狗。无怪乎他们对解放后的新社会，对人民革命政权，表现了刻骨的仇恨，他们咀咒人民革命政权的“灭亡”“完蛋”！
    胡风分子已经混入了我们国家机关的很多部门，也混入了领导中国革命的司令部中国共产党。他们懂得合法斗争，也懂得非法斗争。他们伪装进步，披着马克思主义的外衣，而实际用一切黑暗的卑鄙的分化、争取、造谣、欺骗、偷窃文件、探听消息等两面三刀的豺狼手法，来干着阴谋破坏的反革命勾当。我们必须坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，并肃清一切特务分子。我们建议全国人民代表大会常务委员会撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并请求政府依据宪法第十九条的规定，严惩反革命特务头子胡风。对于清查出的胡风分子和其它一切暗藏的反革命分子，也必须坚决地有分别地依法处理。
    同时，我们必须从胡风反革命集团事件中吸取教训：现在我们才认识胡风不是什么文化人，不是进步作家，而是一个最阴险毒狠的特务头子，我们革命阵营的很多人被他欺骗了几十年，一直把他当成了“朋友”“进步作家”。这说明我们的政治警惕性已经低到何等可怕的程度。我们必须提高警惕，睁开眼睛，并且要学会善于辨别反革命分子的本领，为肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的特务分子而坚决斗争！
    其次，从这一事件中我们还应该认识：在建设社会主义社会的过渡时期中，阶级斗争更加复杂化和尖锐化，决不是一句空话。我们决不能因工作上作出了一点成绩，就让胜利冲昏头脑，就骄傲自满，麻痹大意，必须加强政治学习，提高政治思想水平。不认真地学习马克思列宁主义，不批判资产阶级的“个人主义”“自由主义”“宗派主义”“两面作风”等不良的思想作风，就很难分辨是非，就很容易上反革命分子的当，不但会对革命事业带来损害，而且自己也可能跌入反革命的泥坑。我们要时刻记着：切不要书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。
    我们要提高警惕，坚决镇压一切反革命分子，巩固人民民主专政，保卫我们已经取得和将要取得的伟大胜利。
