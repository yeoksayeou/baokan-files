Xinhua News Agency, London, June 6th: According to TASS, the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party held a special meeting on the 4th and 5th of June.

    Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, emphasized in his speech that the British progressive movement must resolutely demand that the government participate in the Four Power talks to ease international tensions. He pointed out that now that the British parliamentary elections are over, the desire of the United States and the British Conservatives to hold talks is diminishing. "They hope to delay these negotiations as much as possible. They are trying to prevent these negotiations from succeeding. They are creating various problems, and even demanding the restoration of the landlord system and capitalism in Eastern Europe in an attempt to undermine the negotiations."

    Pollitt spoke of the Soviet Union's unremitting initiative to ease international tensions, saying that recently the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia held talks. The results of these negotiations are of great international significance. The positive results achieved by these negotiations far outweigh everything that has happened on the international stage in a long time.

    Referring to Indian Prime Minister Nehru's upcoming visit to the Soviet Union, Pollitt said that the international situation has provided new possibilities for the development of the struggle for peace. He said: However, it would be unwise to underestimate the threats to peace; in such a situation, the British working class and peace forces must strive to change the policies pursued by the British government. A strong movement must be launched to strive for the immediate start of negotiations and to strive for the success of these negotiations.

    Pollitt said: Whether from a domestic or foreign policy perspective, what is most urgent after the British general election is: the entire working class must wage the most resolute, militant, and united struggle for a new policy of peace and social progress. Referring to the results of the parliamentary elections, Pollitt pointed out that the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party should be held responsible for the Labour Party's failure. He said that in most constituencies where Communist Party members were nominated as candidates, the number of votes in favor of Communist Party candidates increased compared to the last election. Pollitt criticized the weaknesses in the Communist Party's work that were revealed during the campaign and called for strengthening the Party. He pointed out that it is necessary to unite the strength of the working class, especially in the struggle for peace and against the Conservative government's preparations to attack the living standards and rights of the working class. Therefore, it is necessary to develop and strengthen the Communist Party, Pollitt said.

    波立特在英共执委会会议上谈国内外形势
    新华社六日讯　据塔斯社伦敦六日讯：英国共产党执行委员会在四日和五日举行了特别会议。
    英国共产党总书记哈·波立特在会上发言时着重指出，英国进步运动必须坚决要求政府参加四大国会谈以缓和国际紧张局势。他指出，现在英国议会选举已经过去了，美国和英国保守党人真正想举行会谈的愿望越来越少了。“他们希望尽量拖延举行这一谈判。他们企图阻挠这一谈判成功。他们在制造各种问题，甚至竟然要求在东欧恢复地主制度和资本主义，以图破坏谈判。”
    波立特谈到苏联不屈不挠地争取缓和国际紧张局势的主动精神，他说，近来苏联和南斯拉夫举行了谈判。这一谈判的结果是具有巨大的国际意义的。这一谈判所取得的积极结果大大超过了长时间内国际舞台上发生的一切。
    波立特在提到印度总理尼赫鲁即将访苏之后说，国际局势已为发展和平斗争提供了新的可能性。他说：然而，如果对和平所受的威胁估计不足，那就是不智的；在这样的局势下，英国的工人阶级和和平力量必须力求改变英国政府所执行的政策。必须展开一个强有力的运动，努力求得立即开始谈判和争取这种谈判成功。
    波立特说：无论是从内政方面说还是从外交方面说，在英国大选之后，最迫切必须的是：整个工人阶级要为和平和社会进步的新的政策进行最坚决的、战斗的和团结一致的斗争。波立特在谈到了议会选举的结果时指出，工党右翼领导人应该对工党的失败负责。他说，在共产党员被提名为候选人的大多数选区中，赞成共产党候选人的票数比上次选举增加了。波立特批评了在竞选运动中表现出来的共产党工作中薄弱的一面，他号召加强党。他指出，必须使工人阶级力量团结一致，尤其是在争取和平和反抗保守党政府准备进攻工人阶级的生活水平和权利的时候。波立特说，因此必须发展和加强共产党。
