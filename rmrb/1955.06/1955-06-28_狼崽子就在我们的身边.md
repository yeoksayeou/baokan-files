    Wolf Cubs are Right Beside Us
    Wu Zuoren Gu Yuan

    When we came to inspect the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, we heard that when the wolf hunt was tight, cunning mother wolves hid their cubs in the hidden corners of the villagers' courtyards. The wolves understand that people only pay attention to going out to hunt wolves, and neglect that the wolf cubs are right in their own homes.

    After we read the "People's Daily" announcement of the "Third Batch of Materials Concerning the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," we knew that the Hu Feng clique was lurking in our revolutionary cultural ranks, viciously carrying out anti-Party and anti-people conspiratorial activities. This is the wolf cub that the US-Chiang Kai-shek spies have planted beside us. We hate these lurking enemies, but before we discovered them, we naively did not take precautions; and this vicious conspiracy group actually pounced on us.

    We demand the severe suppression of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique; and we must redouble our vigilance and completely eliminate the insidious jackals hidden beside us.

    狼崽子就在我们的身边
    吴作人　古元
    我们来到内蒙古草地视察，听说打狼打得紧的时候，狡猾的母狼把崽子藏在老乡的院子角落隐蔽的地方。狼懂得人只注意出外去打狼，就忽略了狼崽子就在自己家里。
    我们看了“人民日报”公布的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”以后，知道胡风集团潜藏在我们革命的文化队伍里，毒辣地进行反党反人民的阴谋活动，这就是美蒋特务在我们身边所埋伏下的狼崽子。我们痛恨这些潜藏着的敌人，但是在我们发现他们之前，我们却天真地不加提防；而这个恶毒的阴谋集团，竟向我们扑上来了。
    我们要求严厉镇压胡风反革命集团；并且要加倍提高我们的警惕，彻底消灭暗藏在我们的身边的阴险的豺狼。
