Three Buildings with Construction Costs Less Than Seventy Yuan Per Square Meter
    Chen Shouru

    The Beijing Design Institute, based on suggestions from construction departments, revised the design drawings for three office buildings of the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau. The Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company, which is undertaking the construction of this project, also actively adopted various advanced technical measures, significantly reducing construction costs compared to the original design. According to the current analysis by the construction department, the average actual cost per square meter can be less than seventy yuan.

    These three office buildings include a four-story building, a five-story building, and a six-story building with a basement, all of which are of mixed structure, with a total construction area of nearly 20,000 square meters. They have electrical equipment such as lighting, doorbells, and telephones, as well as heating and sanitary facilities. The Beijing Design Institute began designing them last year, and all drawings were completed in February of this year. The Fifth Work Zone of the Fourth Construction Engineering Company began construction in April of this year. The four-story office building is currently undergoing interior decoration and will be ready for handover in mid-July. The other two buildings will be completed by the end of August at the latest. When designing these projects, the designers paid attention to the principle of "suitability, economy, and aesthetics where possible" to a certain extent. According to the design budget, the cost of civil construction per square meter is seventy-five yuan, and the cost per square meter including equipment is about ninety yuan.

    Before starting construction, the Fifth Work Zone of the Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company, with the assistance of the work team from the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau, mobilized all technical personnel to study the design drawings. During the study of the drawings, they made some suggestions for improvement to the design. The Beijing Design Institute accepted these suggestions, revised the design, and reduced the project cost. The foundation slab walls were originally designed to use No. 110 cement, but later changed to No. 90 cement, plus rubble, which can save a lot of cement. The room depth was originally designed to be seven meters, but was changed to five and a half meters according to the actual needs and requirements of the construction unit. Regarding the roof, the original design used two layers of moisture-proof cement and cinder paving, and the roof could not be accessed; now it is changed to 200 grade concrete mixed with lime putty, which not only saves funds but also makes use of more than 3,000 square meters of roof area. The pipe trench covers, pipe trench lintels, and iron bars on the main beams of the buildings were originally designed with reinforced concrete; after the drawings were revised, all were replaced with bamboo reinforced concrete and bamboo reinforcement. For the double-sided lath walls of the buildings, bamboo was partially used as the keel, and reed curtains were used instead of laths. The wall and ceiling surfaces, on the basis of strictly implementing operating procedures, eliminated the white lime coating and only smoothed and sprayed slurry on the sand lime. This saves both labor and materials and solves the problem of ceiling dust falling. In order to save wood, the Fifth Work Zone adopted pre-fabricated concrete window frames and partially brick window frames. The indoor cement floor adopts a one-time plastering method, which can save 2.5 kilograms of cement per square meter compared with the original single cement coating method. At the same time, the Fifth Work Zone also promoted advanced measures such as interior scaffolding during construction. Now, based on the construction situation of the Fifth Work Zone for more than two months and the profits already submitted to the state, and according to the labor and materials required for future projects, the actual cost per square meter of the three office buildings can be less than seventy yuan.

    In the design of these three office buildings, although the design institute has cooperated with the construction department to make modifications, some wastes have not been overcome. For example, although the original "Bawangquan" (a type of ornamental bracket) was removed from the eaves, there is still a 75-centimeter overhanging eave for decoration. There is also waste in the foundation design and the use of steel bars. The foundation of that five-story office building still has a space of 2.8 meters high and an area of 1,290 square meters that has not been effectively utilized, thus wasting the originally available construction area. If these wastes can be overcome, the construction cost can be further reduced.

    每平方公尺造价可低于七十元的三幢大楼
    陈寿儒
    北京市设计院根据施工部门的建议，修改了北京市建筑工程局三幢办公楼的设计图纸，承建这项工程的北京市第四建筑工程公司也积极采用各项先进技术措施，使建筑造价比原设计显著降低。据施工部门目前分析，每平方公尺平均实际造价可低于七十元。
    这三幢办公楼，一幢是四层楼房，一幢是五层楼房，一幢是带地下室的六层楼房，都是混合结构，总建筑面积近二万平方公尺。有照明、电铃、电话等电气设备和暖气、卫生设备。北京市设计院在去年开始设计，今年二月全部出图。今年四月，第四建筑工程公司第五工区开始施工。现在四层的办公楼正在进行内部装修，七月中旬就可交工。其他两幢至迟在八月底可以完工。设计师设计这些工程时，在一定程度上注意了“适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观”的原则。按照设计概算，每平方公尺的土建造价是七十五元，加上设备费每平方公尺的造价约在九十元左右。
    在开工以前，北京市第四建筑工程公司第五工区在北京市建筑工程局工作组的协助下，动员全体技术人员对设计图纸进行研究。在研究图纸的过程中，他们对设计提出了一些改进的建议。北京市设计院接受了这些建议，修改设计，降低了工程造价。原设计的基础板墙要用一百一十标号的水泥，后来改用九十标号的，外加块石，可节省不少水泥。房间的进深原设计是七公尺，根据建设单位的实际需要和要求，改为五点五公尺。在屋顶方面，原设计用两层防潮层水泥和焦碴铺面，屋顶不能上人；现在改用二百号混凝土掺白灰膏抹面，不仅可以节省资金，而且使三千多平方公尺的屋顶面积得到利用。楼房的管沟盖、管沟过梁和大梁上的过铁，原设计是钢筋混凝土的；修改图纸后，全部用竹筋混凝土和竹筋来代替。楼房的双面板条墙，部分改用竹子做龙骨，苇帘代板条。墙面和顶棚，在严格贯彻操作规程的基础上，取消了白灰罩面，只在砂子灰上抹平喷浆。这样既节省了工料，也解决了顶棚掉灰的问题。第五工区为了节省木材，采用了混凝土预制的窗框和部分砖砌窗框。室内水泥地面采用一次抹面法，比原来单用水泥罩面，每平方公尺可节省水泥两公斤半。同时，第五工区在施工中还推行了里脚手架等先进措施。现在，根据第五工区两个多月的施工情况和已经提交国家的上缴利润来分析，并根据今后工程所需工料来核算，三幢办公楼每平方公尺的实际造价可低于七十元。
    在这三幢办公楼的设计上，设计院虽曾和施工部门配合进行修改，但仍然有一些浪费没有得到克服。例如在屋檐上虽取消了原设计的霸王拳，还装饰有七十五公分的挑檐。在基础设计方面和钢筋使用上也还有浪费。那幢五层的办公楼的基础，还有二点八公尺高、面积达一千二百九十平方公尺的空间没有加以有效的处理，因而浪费了原可利用的建筑面积。如果能够克服这些浪费，建筑造价还可以降低。
