To Carry Out the Reorganization Work, We Must Earnestly Mobilize the Masses
By Our Staff Commentator

The reorganization work of central-level organs has been fully launched. More than twenty organs have now conveyed the guiding principles and policies of this reorganization work to all staff members, and are mobilizing the masses to conduct discussions, expose the unreasonable phenomena existing in the institutions, staffing, and work, and put forward rationalization proposals for doing a good job in reorganization, overcoming bureaucracy and red tape, and further improving the work of state organs, so as to thoroughly carry out reorganization and improve the work of state organs. A few organs with better progress, such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, have initially determined new staffing plans after discussions combining leadership and the masses.

Judging from the progress of this stage of work, the organs that have done a relatively good job mainly adopt two methods: One is that the leading comrades first formulate a draft reorganization plan after practical research, then submit it to the masses for discussion, and finally revise and finalize the plan. The other is to first mobilize the masses to launch discussions, and then the leadership comprehensively studies and determines the plan. The Ministry of Agriculture, for example, earnestly implemented the spirit of the central reorganization, first opened up the thinking of middle-level leading comrades, and fully mobilized the masses to put forward reorganization plans from bottom to top, resulting in the number of staff members who could be transferred exceeding 50% of the total staff. Similarly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, due to the determination of the leading comrades, first proposed a plan to transfer 50% of the staff after repeated research, and then quickly finalized the plan after full discussion by the masses. The Capital Construction Division of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry originally had more than 40 people. The leading comrades initially determined the staffing to be 41 people in the first study and 32 people in the second study. However, after discussion by the masses, it was unanimously agreed that reducing the number to 21 people would still allow the work to be done well. Facts have proved that no matter which method is adopted, the reorganization work must combine leadership and the masses, and the masses must be earnestly mobilized. Because the vast majority of staff members are scattered in every department and position of the organs, they are the most familiar with and understand the advantages, disadvantages, and problems in the institutions, staffing, and work. Only by mobilizing them to expose shortcomings and raise questions, discuss and study improvement methods, can a practical and reasonable new staffing plan be formulated, and can the reorganization work be carried out effectively in accordance with the central guidelines.

However, to this day, many organs (such as the head office of the People's Bank of China) still have not conveyed the spirit of the central reorganization to the masses, and still have not mobilized the masses to participate in the discussion, making the reorganization work remain among the leading staff members above the division and bureau level, and the reorganization work is actually in a state of stagnation.

One reason why these organs do not mobilize the masses to participate in the reorganization work is that the leadership has not yet put forward a plan, and they are afraid that mobilizing the masses will make things difficult. As mentioned earlier, it is permissible for leading comrades to put forward a reorganization plan first. However, if the leading comrades still do not have a good understanding of the various aspects of their organs, and cannot put forward a practical reorganization plan, but are still reluctant to mobilize the masses, fearing that the masses will "make things difficult," this precisely shows that these leading comrades are not yet determined to carry out the reorganization work. If the masses are truly mobilized, they will put forward many valuable opinions and suggestions to help and encourage the leading comrades to make up their minds and increase their confidence. The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Food first mobilized the masses to discuss, providing a strong basis for the leadership to formulate a reasonable reorganization plan.

Another reason why these organs do not mobilize the masses to participate in the reorganization work is that they are afraid that the masses will know too early, causing ideological fluctuations and unnecessary personal concerns. In fact, the central government has long had instructions on conducting a thorough reorganization of state organs, and the People's Daily has already published an editorial, which is a well-known thing. The responsibility of the leading comrades of various organs is to thoroughly explain the policies to the masses in accordance with the central policies and guidelines, and in light of the specific situation of their organs, and to mobilize the masses to jointly participate in this reorganization work. Only by making the masses thoroughly understand the spirit of the reorganization can the morale of the masses be stabilized and unnecessary personal concerns can be eliminated. If the masses are not mobilized for a long time, it can only show that this organ is not resolute in implementing the central guidelines, and it can only show that they greatly distrust the masses and lack a mass viewpoint and style.

There can be no more hesitation! The leadership of all organs where the reorganization work is progressing slowly must make a decision as soon as possible, fully mobilize the masses, and act quickly.

    进行整编工作必须认真发动群众
    本报评论员
    中央一级机关的整编工作已经全面展开了。目前已有二十多个机关向全体工作人员传达了这次整编工作的方针、政策，并正发动群众进行讨论，揭发机构、编制和工作上存在的不合理的现象，提出作好整编工作、改善领导、改进工作的合理化建议，以彻底进行整编，克服官僚主义、文牍主义，进一步改进国家机关工作。少数进展较好的机关，如内务部、农业部等，经领导和群众结合讨论后，已初步确定了新的编制定员方案。
    从这一段工作开展的情况看，作得比较好的机关，在作法上主要有两种：一种由领导同志经过切实研究首先制定出整编方案的草案，然后交给群众讨论，最后修改定案。一种是先发动群众展开讨论，然后领导上综合研究，确定方案。农业部就是由于领导同志认真贯彻了中央整编精神，先打通中层领导同志的思想，并充分发动了群众，自下而上提出整编方案，结果可以抽调出来的工作人员超过了全部人员的百分之五十。内务部同样由于领导同志有决心，经过反复研究后，先提出了可以抽调出工作人员百分之五十的方案，又经群众充分讨论而迅速定案的。重工业部建筑局基建处原有四十余人，领导同志第一次研究定员为四十一人，第二次研究定为三十二人；但经群众讨论，一致认为减至二十一人还可把工作做好。事实证明，无论采取那一种作法，整编工作都必须领导和群众相结合，都必须认真发动群众。因为广大工作人员散布在机关每个部门、每个岗位上，他们对机构、编制和工作中的优点、缺点和问题，是最熟习、最了解的，只有发动他们揭发缺点和提出问题，讨论和研究改进的办法，才能制定出切实合理的新的编制方案，才能切实按照中央方针进行整编工作。
    但是，至今还有不少机关（如中国人民银行总行等），仍然没有向群众传达中央整编精神，仍然没有发动群众参加讨论，使整编工作停留在司、局长以上领导工作人员中，使整编工作实际上陷于迟滞不前的状态。
    这些机关不发动群众参加整编工作的一个理由是，领导方面还没提出方案，把群众发动起来，怕事情不好办了。前面已经说过，领导同志先提出整编方案是可以的。但是如果领导同志对自己机关的各方面情况还不很了解，还不能提出切实的整编方案，而又迟迟不发动群众，怕群众起来“不好办事”，这正说明这些领导同志对整编工作还没有决心。如果真正发动了群众，群众就会提出很多宝贵的意见和建议，帮助和促进领导同志下定决心和增强信心。高等教育部、粮食部就是先发动群众讨论，群众为领导方面制定合理的整编方案提供了有力的依据的。
    这些机关不发动群众参加整编工作的另一个理由是：怕群众知道早了，思想波动，产生不必要的个人顾虑。其实国家机关要进行一次彻底的整编，中央早有指示，人民日报早就发表社论，已是尽人皆知的事情。各个机关的领导同志的责任就是如何根据中央的政策方针，针对着本机关的具体情况，透彻地向群众讲清政策，发动群众来共同参加这次整编工作。只有使群众彻底了解了整编的精神，才能稳定群众情绪，才能消除不必要的个人顾虑。如果迟迟不发动群众，只能说明这个机关关于执行中央方针的不坚决，只能说明他们十分不相信群众、缺乏群众观点和群众作风。
    不能再犹豫踌躇了！一切整编工作进展迟缓的机关，领导上都要及早下决心，充分发动群众，赶快行动起来。
