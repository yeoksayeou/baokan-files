	Leaping Towards the Hope of Success
April 23, Saturday
	The conference is leaping towards the hope of success today.

	All morning, the journalists in the Red and White Flag Building watched the tightly closed doors of Conference Room No. 2.

	It wasn't until the adjournment at 12:30 that the news came that Zhou Enlai, the head of the Chinese delegation, delivered an important speech for an hour and a half at the morning session.

	Zhou Enlai's speech ended the debate on the issue of "coexistence" since yesterday. Shortly after his speech, a twelve-nation committee was established to draft a resolution on "World Peace and Cooperation."

	Before Zhou Enlai's speech, representatives from Iraq, Lebanon, and the Philippines spoke first. They disagreed with Indian Prime Minister Nehru's views on military blocs at yesterday's meeting and repeated the kind of arguments made by the Turkish representative.

	Iraq's Jamali said that Iraq, unlike India, is a small country and therefore needs allies, and it believes in "peace through strength."

	Lebanon's Malik said that the term "peaceful coexistence" should not be used because it is a "communist term" supposedly used by Stalin in 1926.

	Philippine representative Romulo said that his country disagreed with Nehru's advocacy of not participating in military blocs. He also said that the Philippines joined the Manila Treaty because it was "weak" and found "subversive activities" within the country.

	In short, the idea was to replace "peaceful coexistence" with "power politics."

	At this time, Premier Zhou Enlai spoke.

	He pointed out that the current world situation is indeed tense, but peace is not hopeless, and the number of people who support peace is increasing day by day. The fact that twenty-nine Asian and African countries are meeting here to unanimously call for peace proves that the desire for peace is supported by the majority of countries and people in the world, and also proves that the danger of war can be postponed or even prevented.

	He pointed out that discussing the issue of world peace and cooperation at this conference should be based on such a position, and should put aside different ideologies and different national systems, and solve the issues under discussion on the common basis of demanding peace and cooperation.

	He gave an example, saying that some people say that "peaceful coexistence" is a term used by the communists, then it can be replaced with another term, such as the "peaceful relations" used in the United Nations Charter, and there is no need to lead the discussion to ideology, because that will not lead to any results. He believes that since we are talking about cooperation, the twenty-nine Asian and African countries should first cooperate in the Asian and African region to seek collective peace. He said that China does not approve of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Manila Treaty, and other similar treaties. However, when we gather together today to discuss collective peace, we should first unite among ourselves.

	Premier Zhou Enlai went on to explain: We should first determine some principles. If someone objects to the number of five principles, then we can make some changes in the number. Then he explained, one by one, the seven principles drafted by the Chinese delegation based on what everyone could agree on in the proposals of various countries.

	It is said that Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks absorbed the attention of everyone in the venue. Many representatives left their seats and walked to the front and near the Chinese delegation's seat to listen. By the time Premier Zhou Enlai finished speaking, a large crowd had gathered around him.

	Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who spoke later, especially pointed out that the Chinese Premier's speech today should be given the greatest attention. He said that the Chinese Premier's words are authoritative.

	The morning meeting ended soon after. After the Chinese representative spoke, the newly established drafting group on "World Peace and Cooperation" had a good foundation for its work.

	Following the significant shift within the conference in the morning, another notable event occurred outside the conference at noon. The heads of the delegations of India, Burma, Ceylon, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, and China jointly attended a luncheon hosted by Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, and held talks on the issue of easing tensions in the Far East, especially easing tensions in the Taiwan area.

	Rumors of such a meeting had been circulating since the eve of the Asian-African Conference. The importance of this event is self-evident, and all the reporters were waiting for its outcome.

	As the afternoon meeting was about to begin, Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, who had just attended the meeting of the heads of the eight delegations, arrived at the Red and White Flag Building first. As soon as he got out of the car, reporters swarmed around him.

	"Mr. Prime Minister, any news?"

	"I have nothing to say, Premier Zhou Enlai is going to make a statement. ... Wait and see." From his smiling face, everyone knew there was good news.

	Soon after, reporters obtained from the Chinese delegation the statement made by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai at the meeting of the heads of the eight delegations:

	"The Chinese people are friendly to the American people.

	The Chinese people do not want to fight with the United States. The Chinese government is willing to sit down with the US government to negotiate and discuss the issue of easing tensions in the Far East, especially easing tensions in the Taiwan area."

	The short statement of sixty-nine words immediately shook Bandung, and this shock was immediately transmitted through the air and underwater to the whole world.

	The various delegations in Bandung almost unanimously expressed a positive reaction to this statement immediately.

	Burmese Prime Minister U Nu said that this statement "took a big step towards easing world tensions."

	Pakistani Prime Minister Ali said it "will have an immediate impact on easing world tensions."

	Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said it gives "us hope for the future..."

	Ceylon Prime Minister Kotelawala said it was "a very good statement."

	The spokesperson of the Egyptian delegation said that this statement "fully conforms to the purposes of the Asian-African Conference."

	The Philippines' Romulo and Iraq's Jamali said: "The Chinese proposal is certainly interesting."

	From the beginning of the Asian-African Conference until now, one could always sense a restless conspiracy, wanting to use the Asian-African Conference, under the guise of peace, to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan. Everyone still remembers that just one day before the opening of the Asian-African Conference, US President Eisenhower, after meeting with his Secretary of State Dulles, issued a statement on the situation in the Taiwan area, saying that he hoped "the Bandung Conference will pay attention to the universal desire for peace of the people of all countries in the world, and will try to condemn the practice of using force to achieve national ambitions."

	However, the facts are exactly the opposite of this attempt.

	Now, the representatives of twenty-nine countries, representing more than half of humanity, have personally heard and been convinced of the Chinese people's desire for peace.

	Can tensions in the Far East, especially tensions in the Taiwan area, be eased through Sino-US negotiations?

	The whole world has seen that this question must now be answered by Washington.

	The Chinese delegation head's speech in the morning and statement in the afternoon significantly changed the pessimistic atmosphere inside and outside the conference. People felt confident that the conference would complete its work tomorrow.

	The afternoon meeting of delegation heads smoothly passed the economic cooperation report submitted by the Economic Committee and the cultural cooperation report submitted by the Cultural Committee, and also passed the resolution supporting Yemen's position on the Aden and South Yemen area issues, as well as the resolution advocating that membership in the United Nations should be universal and that the representation on the Security Council should be based on the principle of fair geographical distribution.

	It was noted that the colonialism issue group, which exceptionally started working at 7:30 this morning, has still not reached an agreement. It should be acknowledged that there are still thorny issues here.

	The press release of the meeting of delegation heads, which was published at 7 o'clock, has already announced that a plenary meeting will be held at 3 pm tomorrow. (To be continued)

    人民的心同亚非会议在一起
    ——亚非会议日记 　李慎之  张彦
   （续昨）
      朝着成功的希望跃进
    四月二十三日　星期六
    会议今天是在朝着成功的希望跃进。
    整个上午，在红白旗大厦的记者们眼睁睁地看着第二号会议室紧闭着的大门。
    一直到十二点半散会的时候，传来了消息，中国代表团团长周恩来在上午会议上以一个半钟头的时间，作了一篇重要的发言。
    周恩来的发言结束了从昨天以来在“共处”问题上的争论，在他的发言之后不久，就成立了起草关于“世界和平和合作问题的决议”的十二国委员会。
    在周恩来发言以前，伊拉克、黎巴嫩和菲律宾的代表先发了言。他们不同意昨天会议上印度总理尼赫鲁关于军事集团的意见，而重复了土耳其代表的那种论调。
    伊拉克的贾马利说，伊拉克不像印度，它是个小国，因而它需要盟国，它相信“以实力求和平”。
    黎巴嫩的马里克说，不应该用“和平共处”这个名词，因为它是据说斯大林在一九二六年就已经使用过的“共产党名词”。
    菲律宾代表罗慕洛说，他的国家不同意尼赫鲁的不参加军事集团的主张。他还说，菲律宾之所以参加马尼拉条约是因为它“弱小”，并且发现国内有“颠覆活动”。
    总之是，要以“实力政策”来代替“和平共处”。
    这时候，周恩来总理发言了。
    他指出：目前世界的形势的确是紧张的，但是和平并没有绝望，拥护和平的人一天比一天多。二十九个亚非国家在这里开会，一致呼吁和平，就证明和平愿望是得到世界上多数国家和人民支持的，也证明战争危险是可以推迟甚至于制止的。
    他指出，在这次会议上讨论世界和平和合作的问题，就应该根据这样的立场，就应该撇开不同的意识形态，不同的国家制度，以要求和平合作为共同基础来解决正在讨论的问题。
    他举例说，有人说“和平共处”是共产党用的名词，那末可以换一个名词，可以采用联合国宪章中所用的“和平相处”，而没有必要把讨论引到意识形态上去，因为那是不会有什么结果的，他认为，既然谈合作，亚非二十九国就首先应在亚非地区合作起来求得集体和平，他说，中国是不赞成北大西洋公约、马尼拉条约和其他类似条约的。但是，今天共聚一堂讨论集体和平时，应该在自己当中首先团结起来。
    周恩来总理接着说明：我们首先应该确定一些原则，如果有人反对五项原则的数目，那么可以在数字上作些更动。然后他就逐条解释了中国代表团根据各国提案中大家都能同意的东西拟成的七项原则。
    据说，周恩来总理的这一席话吸住了会场里每一个人的注意，许多代表离开了自己的座位走到中国代表席位的前面和近处站着听。等到周恩来总理的话讲完时，他的周围已经站了一大堆人。
    后来发言的印度总理尼赫鲁特别指出，中国总理今天的发言应该受到最大的重视。他说，中国总理说的话是权威的。
    上午的会议不久就结束了。在中国代表发言以后，新成立的关于“世界和平和合作问题的起草小组”在工作时已经有了良好的基础。
    继上午在会内发生的重大转变以后，中午在会外又发生了一件引人注目的大事。印度、缅甸、锡兰、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、泰国和中国的代表团团长
  一起参加了印度尼西亚沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理的午宴，并且对和缓远东紧张局势问题，特别是和缓台湾地区紧张局势的问题进行了会谈。
    从亚非会议开会前夕，就已经流传着要举行这样一次会谈的消息了，这个事件的重要性是不言而喻的，所有的记者都在等待它的结果。
    下午会议将近开始的时候，刚刚参加了八国代表团团长会谈的巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里首先到了红白旗大厦。他刚走下汽车，记者们就一涌而上。
      “总理先生，有什么消息？”
      “我没有什么要说的，周恩来总理倒要发表一个声明。……等着瞧吧。”从他笑着的面容中，大家知道有一个好消息。
    不久以后，记者们就从中国代表团那里得到了中国总理周恩来在八国代表团团长会议上的声明：
    “中国人民同美国人民是友好的。
    中国人民不要同美国打仗。中国政府愿意同美国政府坐下来谈判，讨论和缓远东紧张局势的问题，特别是和缓台湾地区的紧张局势问题。”
    短短的六十九个字的声明，立刻震动了万隆，而且这种震动立刻通过电波从空中、海底传到全世界去。
    在万隆的各国代表团几乎是一致地对这个声明立刻表现了积极的反应。
    缅甸总理吴努说：这个声明“向和缓世界紧张局势走了一大步”。
    巴基斯坦总理阿里说：它“在缓和世界紧张局势方面立即发生影响”。
    印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约说：它使
  “我们有了对于将来……的希望”。
    锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉说：这是“一篇非常好的声明”。
    埃及代表团的发言人说：这个声明“完全符合亚非会议的目的”。
    菲律宾的罗慕洛和伊拉克的贾马利说：“中国的建议是肯定令人感到兴趣的。”
    从亚非会议开始到现在，都一直可以感到有一种跃跃欲试的阴谋，想利用亚非会议，假借和平的名义，来阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾。大家还记得，仅仅在亚非会议开幕以前一天，美国总统艾森豪威尔在和他的国务卿杜勒斯会谈以后曾就台湾地区局势问题发表声明说：他希望“万隆会议将注意世界各国人民普遍的和平愿望，并将设法谴责以武力实现国家野心的做法”。
    然而，事实与这种企图恰巧相反。
    现在，代表人类半数以上的二十九个国家的代表亲自听见了，并且信服了中国人的和平意愿。
    到底远东紧张局势，特别是台湾地区紧张局势能否经由中美谈判而得到和缓呢？
    全世界都看到了，这个问题现在要由华盛顿来回答。
    中国代表团团长上午的发言和下午的声明显著地改变了会内会外的悲观空气。人们对于会议将在明天完成工作这一点，感到有了信心。
    下午的团长会议顺利地通过了经济委员会所提出的经济合作报告和文化委员会所提出的文化合作报告，也通过了支持也门在亚丁和也门南部地区问题上的立场的决议，以及主张联合国成员应该具有普遍性，安全理事会的代表权应该以公平的地理分配原则为根据的决议。
    大家注意到，破例从今天早晨七点半就开始工作的殖民主义问题小组始终没有达成协议，应该承认，这里还有棘手的问题。
    七点钟发表的代表团团长会议公报已经宣布了，明天下午三点将举行全体会议。（待续）
