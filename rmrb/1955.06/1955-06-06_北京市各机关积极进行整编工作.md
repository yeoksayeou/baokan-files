Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: Beijing Municipal People's Committee-affiliated municipal-level organs are actively carrying out streamlining work.

    To strengthen leadership over this work, the Municipal People's Committee established a staffing commission, and each organ also established staffing commissions or staffing groups. The Municipal People's Committee also held an expanded administrative meeting and a meeting of cadres above the section chief level of each unit to mobilize and deploy the work. Currently, after the leading cadres have personally carried out inspections and discussions with the masses or activists, preliminary streamlining plans have been drafted.

    In recent years, Beijing's various tasks have greatly developed, and the personnel of various municipal-level institutions have also continued to increase. However, due to the initial lack of experience of cadres, the tasks of some units were very unclear, resulting in a blind expansion of staffing. The inspection during this streamlining process revealed that many organs had serious problems such as large institutions, overlapping layers, overstaffing, and bureaucracy. For example, the Supply Section of the Municipal Grain Bureau had a total of sixty-five people, divided into five groups within the section. Each group had full-time external liaison personnel. These external liaison personnel were only responsible for external contacts and often idled because they had no external liaison tasks. Most cadres in the Planning and Inspection Group of the Municipal Public Health Bureau had nothing to do. Many cadres felt distressed and asked to do more work. Some organs had excessively detailed divisions of labor, resulting in duplication of work. For example, the Construction Industry Allocation Section and the Introduction Section of the Municipal Labor Bureau both had labor resource groups responsible for understanding the labor force situation in various districts. Sometimes, two sections went to work in one district at the same time, which not only wasted manpower but also added a lot of trouble to the district's labor section.

    In this streamlining process, the leading cadres of some organs personally took action, mobilized the masses to conduct discussions, and adopted the method of combining streamlining with improving work, which achieved very good results. The initial streamlining plan proposed by the leadership of the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau could only transfer ninety-eight people. After mobilizing the masses to conduct discussions and deeply examining the problems existing in the institutions, staffing, and work, a new plan was drafted that could transfer one hundred and ninety-seven people, accounting for about fifty-three percent of the current number of people in the bureau.

    Now, according to the instructions of the Municipal People's Committee, each unit is further studying and revising the preliminary streamlining plan.

    北京市各机关积极进行整编工作
    新华社五日讯　北京市人民委员会所属市一级机关积极进行整编工作。
    为了加强对这一工作的领导，市人民委员会成立了编制委员会，各机关也成立了编制委员会或编制小组。市人民委员会并举行了扩大行政会议和各单位科长以上干部会议，作了动员和布置。目前各单位经过领导干部亲自动手进行检查，并经过群众或积极分子讨论后，已拟定出初步整编方案。
    几年来北京市的各种工作有很大发展，市级各种机构的人员也随着不断增加，但由于干部开始时缺乏经验，有些单位的任务很不明确，因此造成盲目扩大编制。这次在整编中检查发现很多机关机构庞大、层次重叠、人浮于事、文牍主义等现象很严重。如市粮食局供应科全科六十五人，科内分五个组，每组都设有专职外勤人员，这些外勤人员只管对外联系，常常因为没有对外联系的任务而闲空下来。市公共卫生局办公室计划检查组大多数干部无事可做，不少干部感到苦恼，要求多做工作。有些机关分工过细，工作有重复现象。如市劳动局建筑业调配科和介绍科，都设有劳动力资源组，负责到各区了解劳动力情况，有时两个科同时去一个区工作，不仅浪费人力，也为区的劳动科增添很多麻烦。
    在这次整编中，有些机关的领导干部亲自动手，发动群众进行讨论，并采用使整编和改进工作相结合的办法，获得了很好的效果。市建筑工程局领导上最初提出的整编方案只能抽调出九十八人，经发动群众进行讨论，深入地检查了机构上、编制上、工作上存在的问题后，即拟定出了能抽调出一百九十七人的新方案，占全局目前现有人数的百分之五十三左右。
    现在各单位正根据市人民委员会的指示，对初步整编方案作进一步的研究和修正。
