Comrades and Friends!

The delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is visiting the great People's Republic of China with extremely joyous feelings.

Vietnam and China are brotherly countries. The people of Vietnam and China have had a sincere and profound friendship since ancient times. We are deeply moved by the warm welcome given to us by all comrades and friends today. On this occasion, our delegation would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone.

China is a great, strong, and beautiful country, and its long-standing and excellent culture has a profound influence on Asia and the world. Since the Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, achieved the historic victory of the People's Liberation War, they have made rapid progress in all aspects of the labor of building a socialist system, which the Vietnamese people regard as the achievement of the Vietnamese people. Today, the Vietnamese people are actively struggling to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete the thorough realization of independence and democracy. This struggle has been and will continue to be strongly encouraged and supported by the Chinese people and the people of the world. We are deeply convinced that our long-term, arduous, and just struggle will surely win victory.

Please allow me to once again express my deep gratitude to the Chinese people and the people of Guangxi Province.

Finally, let me shout:

Long live the eternal friendship between the people of Vietnam and China!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the best friend of the Vietnamese people!
