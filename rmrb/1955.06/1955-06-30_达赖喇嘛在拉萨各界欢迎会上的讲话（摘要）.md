Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, June 29th. Dalai Lama Danzeng Gyatso, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Representative of the First National People's Congress, delivered a speech at the Lhasa All-Circles Welcome Meeting today, excerpts of which are as follows:

    Last July, we departed from Lhasa and met Panchen Erdene, who had taken the route through Qinghai, in Xi'an. Together we went to the capital of the motherland, Beijing, and gloriously met Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups, and received his cordial instructions. At the National People's Congress, we, along with more than 1,200 representatives, jointly discussed and formulated the Constitution and elected the leading personnel of the state organs, successfully completing the tasks of the Congress. This is an achievement unprecedented in our country's history. The Constitution consolidates the interests of all Chinese people, solidifies the great unity of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups, and stipulates the rights and obligations that all ethnic groups should enjoy and fulfill, especially fully taking into account the equal rights of all minority ethnic groups. We must all study and support the Constitution well.

    On October 1st, we participated in the National Day ceremony celebrating the 5th anniversary of the motherland. The parade of 500,000 people shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" The entire Tiananmen Square formed a grand and solemn scene. We in Tibet feel supremely honored and proud to be a member of the motherland's big family.

    In March of this year, the 7th Plenary Meeting of the State Council passed various decisions regarding work in Tibet. The local government of Tibet and the Panchen Kampus Conference Hall Committee reached a satisfactory agreement on historical and pending issues. The State Council's decision to establish a Preparatory Committee for the unified Tibet Autonomous Region, based on the specific circumstances of Tibet's existing political, economic, cultural, customs, and religious beliefs, and to gradually develop construction undertakings, is a concrete realization of the Seventeen-Point Agreement and a great achievement for the Tibetan people to embark on the road to happiness.

    When we visited major cities in the motherland, we were warmly welcomed and received by the responsible persons and people from all walks of life in various places. We personally witnessed the unparalleled achievements made on all fronts in just a few years under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and through the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. Chairman Mao's great policy of ethnic equality has united all fraternal ethnic groups into a friendly and cooperative big family. We have been to Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian, Fushun, and Harbin, and have seen many large-scale factories. Especially when we saw all the new equipment in the factories of Anshan, China's steel capital, and the selfless labor of the workers, we firmly believed that the construction of our motherland would surely achieve the expected victory. Chairman Mao's great policies of ethnic equality and ethnic unity are victoriously shining on every region of the motherland. For example, after the establishment of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province, it gained the right to "be the master of its own house" in managing its own internal affairs. The majority of the staff in governments at all levels are cadres of the local ethnic group, and schools and hospitals use the language and script of the local ethnic group. Especially in terms of culture and education, 95% of school-age children have the opportunity to attend school. After seeing these situations, we realized even more the necessity of establishing ethnic regional autonomous governments. Tibet, like other minority ethnic groups in the country, is relatively backward in terms of economy and culture, which makes it even more necessary to rely on the selfless and relatively long-term help of the central government and the advanced Han people and Han cadres. In all the large and small cities, we saw that all temples were protected, and all male and female believers freely practiced various religions without any restrictions. All religions and sects throughout the country have not only not been damaged in the slightest, but have also been respected and protected, concretely realizing the provision of freedom of religious belief in Article 88 of the Constitution.

    We also went to Qinghai's Tar Temple, the birthplace of the Yellow Sect founder Tsongkhapa, and Labrang Monastery in Gansu, as well as major temples under the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Xikang, for dozens of days of pilgrimage and sutra lectures, and met with thousands of Living Buddhas, Lamas, and the broad masses. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past, Qinghai's Tar Temple suffered serious damage, but it has been repaired under the care of the central government since liberation.

    From the time we departed from Lhasa until our safe return today, Tibet has also made great achievements in all aspects of politics and religion. Further enhancements and consolidation have been achieved in the unity of fraternal ethnic groups, especially the unity of the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, and the unity within the Tibetan ethnic group. At the same time, with the greatest help and care from the central government, and with the heroic and tenacious efforts of the People's Liberation Army's troops stationed in Tibet and all road builders, the Kangzang and Qingzang highways have been fully opened to traffic. The full opening of these two highways has not only created a good foundation for consolidating national defense, but also opened up broad roads for further strengthening the unity among fraternal ethnic groups and carrying out various construction undertakings in the Tibetan region in the future. All these achievements are the result of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. But we must all know that the imperialists will not be reconciled to these achievements our country has made. They have tried every possible means to create rumors and attempt to provoke relations. In the future, they will continue to try all kinds of despicable means to carry out provocation and sabotage. Therefore, all of us, Han and Tibetan people, must not only have a high degree of vigilance, but also resolutely strengthen and consolidate the unity among all fraternal ethnic groups, especially between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, and within the Tibetan ethnic group, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. With the selfless help of the advanced Han people and Han cadres, let us work together to build a new Tibet with a happy, prosperous, and flourishing political and religious life for the motherland, and strive for the great construction cause of the motherland!

    达赖喇嘛在拉萨各界欢迎会上的讲话（摘要）
    新华社拉萨二十九日电　全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、第一届全国人民代表大会代表达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措，二十九日在拉萨各界欢迎大会上讲话的摘要：
    去年七月，我们从拉萨出发，在西安市与取道青海的班禅额尔德尼相见，并一同到了祖国首都北京，光荣的会见了各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席，并且得到了亲切的指示。在全国人民代表大会上，我们同一千二百多名代表一起，共同讨论和制定了宪法，选举了国家机关的领导工作人员，圆满地完成了大会的任务，这是我国过去历史上未曾有过的成就。宪法巩固了全中国人民的利益，固定了全国各民族友爱合作的大团结，规定了各族人民应享的权利和应尽的义务，特别是充分照顾到各少数民族民族平等的权利。我们大家都必须好好的学习宪法和拥护宪法。
    十月一日我们参加了祖国五周年的国庆节观礼。五十万人的游行队伍，高呼毛主席和中国共产党万岁。整个天安门前形成了伟大而庄严的场面。我们西藏以自己是祖国大家庭中的一员而感到无尚的光荣和骄傲。
    今年三月，国务院全体会议第七次会议通过了关于西藏工作问题的各项决定。西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会之间关于历史和悬案问题达成了圆满的协议。国务院关于建立统一的西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定，根据西藏地方现有的政治、经济、文化、风俗习惯、宗教信仰的具体情况，逐步发展建设事业，这是十七条协议的具体实现，是西藏民族和西藏人民走向幸福道路的一个伟大成就。
    我们到祖国各大城市参观时，受到各地负责人和各界人民的热情欢迎和招待，亲眼看到短短几年来在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在全国人民的共同努力下，在各个战线上都获得了不可比喻的成就，毛主席伟大的民族平等政策，使全国各兄弟民族团结成为友爱合作的大家庭。我们曾到沈阳、鞍山、大连、抚顺及哈尔滨等地，见到了许多规模宏大的工厂，尤其是当我们看到我国的钢都——鞍山市的工厂的一切新式设备和工人们忘我的劳动的时候，使我们坚定不移地相信我们的祖国的建设一定会得到预期的胜利。毛主席的伟大民族平等和民族团结的政策，胜利地照耀着祖国的每一个地区，如吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区成立以后，得到了在管理本民族内部事务上“当家做主”的权利。各级政府中的工作人员，绝大部分是本民族的干部，学校和医院都是用本民族的语言和文字，特别是文教方面，百分之九十五的学龄儿童都有入学的机会。当我们看到这些情况后，我们越发认识到成立民族区域自治政府的必要性。我们西藏和全国其他各少数民族一样，在经济、文化等方面是比较落后的，这就更需要依靠中央和先进汉族人民和汉族干部大公无私和比较长期的帮助。在各大小城市中，我们看到所有的寺庙都受到了保护，所有男女信徒，充分自由的信仰各种宗教，不受任何限制，全国各地所有的宗教和教派，不但没有受到丝毫的破坏，而且得到了尊重和保护，具体的实现了宪法第八十八条中宗教信仰自由的规定。
    我们还到黄教祖师宗喀巴诞生之地青海塔尔寺，和甘肃拉卜楞寺以及西康藏族自治州所属各大寺庙进行了几十天的朝佛和讲经，同成千上万的活佛、喇嘛及广大群众见了面。在过去国民党反动统治时期，青海塔尔寺曾遭到严重的破坏，但解放以来在中央的关怀下，已经修复了。
    从拉萨出发起，一直到今天平安的回来，西藏在政教各方面，也取得很大的成就，在兄弟民族的团结，特别是汉、藏民族的团结和西藏民族内部的团结上，都取得了进一步的增强和巩固。同时在中央的最大帮助和关怀下，在人民解放军进藏部队和全体筑路人员英勇顽强的努力下，康藏和青藏两条公路全线通车了。这两条公路的全线通车，不仅为巩固祖国国防创造了良好的基础，而且为今后更进一步加强各兄弟民族间的团结、开展西藏地区的各项建设事业开辟了广阔的道路。这一切成就，是中国共产党和毛主席正确领导的结果。但我们大家要知道帝国主义是不会甘心于我们国家所取得的这些成就的，他们曾经千方百计制造谣言，妄图挑拨关系，以后他们还会不断的想尽各种卑鄙的办法来进行挑拨破坏。因此我们所有汉、藏人民，不仅要有高度的警惕性，而且必需坚决地在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，进一步地加强和巩固各兄弟民族、特别是汉、藏民族之间以及西藏民族内部的团结。在先进汉族人民和汉族干部大公无私的帮助下，为建设幸福美满的政教昌盛的祖国的新西藏而共同奋斗，为伟大的祖国的建设事业而奋斗！
