    Strike Down the Smiling Tiger
  　Geng Changsuo
    I am a farmer and do not know much about Hu Feng. Recently, after reading the "People's Daily" exposé of the three sets of materials concerning the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I realized that Hu Feng and many of the core members of his group had long been loyal running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. They had close ties with the imperialist Kuomintang secret service and had been disguising themselves as revolutionaries, hiding within the revolutionary ranks, engaging in counter-revolutionary activities for a long time. I am extremely resentful of them! Hu Feng and his gang of smiling tigers, who "shake hands and exchange pleasantries" with us, have always been pointing their bloody mouths at the Party and the people. After the nationwide liberation and the people becoming masters of their own house, they have become even more fierce, attempting to have the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek ride on the backs of our people again, and attempting to make the Chinese working class and all working people revert to a dark and hopeless life.
    What insidious and vicious enemies Hu Feng and the Hu Feng clique are!
    Like our elder brothers, the workers, we farmers have had better lives since liberation, have been politically emancipated, and are working hard to build a beautiful and happy socialist life. We will never allow the Hu Feng clique and all counter-revolutionaries to undermine our fruits of victory. All members of our production cooperative unanimously and resolutely demand that the government severely suppress the Hu Feng clique, wipe out this gang of smiling tigers in one fell swoop, and punish them according to the law. We are also determined to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, increase our revolutionary vigilance, and our ability to distinguish counter-revolutionaries, and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

    打杀笑面虎
  　耿长锁
    我是一个庄稼人，对胡风是不了解的。最近看了“人民日报”揭发的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，我才知道胡风和他所领导的集团中的许多骨干分子，很早以来就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，他们同帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切联系，长期地伪装革命，隐藏在革命队伍内部，干着反革命的勾当。我对他们非常的愤恨！胡风这群同我们“握手言欢”的笑面虎，一直是把血口朝着党，朝着人民。全国解放、人民当家作主以后，他们就变得越加厉害了，他们妄想国民党蒋介石再骑在我们人民头上，妄想使中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民再倒回去过暗无天日的生活。
    胡风和胡风集团是多么阴险、恶毒的敌人呵！
    和工人老大哥一样，我们农民在解放以后日子过好了，政治上翻身了，并且也正在努力建设美好幸福的社会主义生活。我们决不允许胡风集团和一切反革命分子破坏我们的胜利果实。我们生产合作社全体社员一致坚决要求政府严厉镇压胡风集团，把胡风这群笑面虎一网打尽，依法惩办。我们并决心更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，提高革命警惕性和辨别反革命分子的能力，把一切隐藏的反革命分子都清除掉。
