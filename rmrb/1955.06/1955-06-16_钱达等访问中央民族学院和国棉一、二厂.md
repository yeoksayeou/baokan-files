    (Reported by this newspaper) Qian Da, head of the Indian Cultural Delegation, Mrs. Qian Da, and some members of the delegation, continued their visits and tours in the capital.
    At 9:30 a.m. on the 15th, they arrived at the Central Institute for Nationalities and were warmly welcomed by students dressed in various colorful ethnic costumes. The distinguished guests, accompanied by Vice President Xiong Shouqi, visited the classroom building. Mr. Qian Da spoke with several students, inquiring about their studies and living conditions. Tibetan student Lhaden Pemba, the niece of the previous Dalai Lama, had lived in Kalimpong, India, for four years. Mr. Qian Da asked her, "Do you like that place?" Pemba said, "Yes, I like India very much." Qian Da shook hands with her warmly.
    The distinguished guests entered the solemn and dignified Tibetan Scripture Hall to pay respects to Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Yellow Sect of Buddhism, and various other Buddhist statues. They visited the prayer hall set up specifically for students of the Islamic faith and one of the seven canteens set up to address the dietary needs of students with different religious beliefs. In the reading room, they saw newspapers and periodicals published in Mongolian, Uyghur, Tibetan, Korean, and other minority languages.
    Wherever the distinguished guests went—classrooms, corridors, lawns, under shady trees—warm applause resounded everywhere. The Indian friends greeted the welcomers with palms together. Finally, the hosts and guests held a small get-together on the open space in front of the Research Department building. The students performed four dance programs, including "Happy Young Men" and "Miao Reed Pipe Dance." Indian folk song singers the Deepak Brothers sang a Punjabi folk song for the students, and female dancer Guha performed a section of Kathak dance.
    When bidding farewell to Vice President Xiong, Mr. Qian Da said: "It is a very good thing that the Chinese government has established such a large institution to train cadres from minority nationalities. India also faces the same problem. We can learn a lot from you here."
    At 2 p.m., Mr. Qian Da and others arrived at the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory.
    The distinguished guests carefully inspected the trial operation of various processes in the seven workshops, asking the factory staff about the scale of the factory and some production issues. They also looked at the workshop's blackboard newspaper, which featured an article praising the work attitude of weaver Sheng Deshun. The nimble movements of the workers doffing bobbins attracted the visitors. They watched there for a long time.
    Subsequently, the distinguished guests visited the workers' dormitory of the State-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. When the representatives arrived at the dining hall, many workers were preparing to hold a meeting. Seeing the guests from afar, they all stood up and applauded warmly. The representatives were very interested in the cafeteria's inexpensive menu. They also saw the factory's People's Bank, where many workers had savings. On the way to leave the factory, they encountered a female worker holding a plump, white baby. Mr. Qian Da asked the female worker with concern where the child was placed when she went to work. The female worker replied that she put the child in the factory's nursery when she went to work. Mr. Qian Da was very happy to hear this, and finally shook hands with her cordially before saying goodbye.

    钱达等访问中央民族学院和国棉一、二厂
    本报讯　印度文化代表团团长钱达、钱达夫人和一部分团员，继续在首都访问和参观。
    十五日上午九时半，他们来到中央民族学院，受到了穿着各种鲜艳民族服装的学生们的热情欢迎。贵宾们在副院长熊寿祺陪同下参观了教室大楼。钱达先生和好几个学生谈了话，询问他们学习和生活的情况。藏族学员拉登·柏姆是前世达赖喇嘛的侄女，曾经在印度加伦邦住过四年。钱达先生问她：“你喜欢那个地方吗？”柏姆说：“是的，我很喜欢印度。”钱达和她紧紧地握手。
    贵宾们走进了肃穆庄严的藏经楼，瞻仰黄教世祖宗喀巴和其他各种佛像。他们参观了专为信奉伊斯兰教的同学设立的礼拜堂，参观了为解决不同宗教信仰学生的饮食问题而分设的七个食堂中的一个。在阅览室里，他们看到了用蒙、维吾尔、藏、朝鲜等少数民族文字出版的报刊。
    贵宾们无论走到那里，教室内，走廊里，草坪上，浓荫下，到处都响起热烈的掌声。印度朋友们双手合十向欢迎者问好。宾主最后在研究部大楼前的平地上举行了一次小型联欢会，学员们演出了“快乐的小伙子”、“苗族芦笙舞”等四个舞蹈节目。印度民歌歌唱家迪帕克兄弟为学员们合唱了一首旁遮普省的民歌，女舞蹈家古哈表演了卡塔克舞中的一段。
    钱达先生在和熊副院长握别的时候说：中国政府设立这样大的学府来培养少数民族干部，是一件很好的工作。印度也存在着同样的问题。我们从你们这里可以学到许多东西。
    下午二时，钱达先生等到了国营北京第二棉纺织厂。
    贵宾们仔细地参观了七个车间各个工序的试车情况，向工厂的工作人员询问工厂的规模和生产上的一些问题。他们还看了车间的黑板报，上面有一篇表扬车工绳德顺劳动态度的文章。正在落纱的工人的敏捷动作吸引住了参观者。他们在那里观看了很久。
    随后，贵宾们参观了国营北京第一棉纺织厂的工人宿舍。当代表们到饭厅时，很多工人正准备开会，见远方的客人来了，都站起来热烈地鼓掌。代表们对食堂便宜的菜单很感兴趣。他们还看了厂里的人民银行，在那里很多工人都有存款。在临离开工厂的路上，碰见一个女工抱着一个白胖胖的小孩。钱达先生关切地问这位女工，上班的时候孩子放在那里？女工回答说，上班时把孩子放在厂里的乳儿室，钱达先生听了很高兴，最后和她亲切地握手告别。
