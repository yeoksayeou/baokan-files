Shandong Paper Mill Implements Conservation Plan
    The employees of Shandong Paper Mill plan to save over 1,271,000 yuan throughout the year. Among these savings, the adoption of low-priced paper-making raw materials, improved utilization of raw materials, reduced pulp consumption, and conservation of valuable equipment can reduce costs by more than 332,000 yuan. Reducing the backlog of finished products and raw materials, processing waste materials, and reducing inventory reserves can save more than 549,000 yuan in working capital.

    This plan was formulated on the basis of mobilizing the masses to conduct a general review of the completion of the first quarter's plan, criticizing conservative and complacent thinking, revising the annual state plan, and based on the requirements of the Ministry of Light Industry regarding conservation. Everyone has the confidence to complete and exceed this plan. Now, staff, technicians, and workers are actively making guarantees to implement the competition plan. The No. 2 Paper Machine Workshop has adopted the method of "analyzing every five days and summarizing every ten days" to identify loopholes and mobilize the masses to plug them in a timely manner. For example, in May, they found during an inspection that although the entire workshop had completed the plan, the advanced masked the backward, resulting in a waste of more than 2,000 yuan. They are now summarizing the experience of advanced work sections and promoting it throughout the workshop. The No. 3 Paper Machine Workshop is promoting team-based economic accounting, which is proving to be even more effective.

    山东造纸总厂贯彻节约计划
    山东造纸总厂职工计划全年节约一百二十七万一千多元。其中由于采用低价造纸原料、提高原料利用率、降低用浆量、节约贵重器材等项，就可以降低成本三十三万二千多元；因为减少成品和原材料的积压、处理废料、缩减库存储备等，可以节约流动资金五十四万九千多元。
    这一计划是在发动群众普遍检查第一季度完成计划的情况，批判保守自满思想，在修订全年国家计划的基础上，根据中央轻工业部关于节约的要求制定的。大家有信心完成和超额完成这个计划。现在，职员、技术人员和工人们正纷纷提出保证，贯彻执行竞赛计划。二抄成车间采取“五日一分析、十日一总结”的办法，发现漏洞，及时发动群众堵塞。如五月份，他们检查，虽然全车间完成了计划，但因为先进的把落后的掩盖了，发现浪费两千多元。目前他们正在总结先进工段的经验，向全车间推广。三抄成车间则正在推行班组经济核算，成效更大。
