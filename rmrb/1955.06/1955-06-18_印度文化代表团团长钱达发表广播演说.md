Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: Mr. A.K. Chanda, head of the Indian Cultural Delegation, delivered a radio address to the Chinese people tonight on the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing.

Mr. Chanda said, "Let me convey to you the warm greetings and sincere congratulations of the Indian people on behalf of the Indian Cultural Delegation. We bring you wishes of peace and friendship. Since the moment we arrived, the spontaneous welcome given to us by the Chinese people has demonstrated your warm friendship towards India and the Indian people. Of course, it may be said that this welcome is not unexpected, because our friendship is deeply rooted in the long history of our two countries. Since ancient times, China and India have always understood and respected each other."

Mr. Chanda said that with the birth of New India and New China, this ancient friendship is being restored. "However, our current task is not merely to restore what existed in the past, nor even to build upon past traditions. Conditions have changed, and the environment has also changed. Today, we are more convinced than ever that culture knows no borders. When India and China exchange their respective achievements, they both realize that this exchange is taking place in a new world with a new environment."

Mr. Chanda said, "As we each further develop our respective economies, societies, and politics in our own ways, peaceful cooperation, especially in the cultural field, will certainly develop. In the past few days, we have clearly seen evidence of the development of cultural cooperation between our two countries. But we still have a long way to go. Since we became masters of our own destiny in our countries, our cultural exchanges have not had time to develop well. Nevertheless, even these limited contacts have produced the most interesting and encouraging results. In both our countries, there are friendship associations that bring our two countries closer. In India, people have shown great interest in the India-China Friendship Association. Its influence is growing, and many prominent thinkers, writers, and artists support it. In your country, the China-India Friendship Association is also developing. Mutual visits by various delegations are consolidating cultural cooperation between India and China. I sincerely hope that this delegation, which I have the honor of leading, will become another link in the cultural chain between our two countries."

Mr. Chanda said, "Our delegation includes representatives of classical and folk arts. These artists come from different regions of the country. They bring the special styles of those art forms from their respective regions. All of this constitutes the rich and colorful Indian culture. We will do our best to convey the basic unity of Indian culture and its harmonious beauty to the Chinese people. We have already performed several times, and we have been greatly encouraged by the sincere welcome given to us. In the next two months, we will travel to various parts of your great country. It will be a pleasure for us to introduce a brief overview of our country's culture to those regions. With your friendship and support, we are confident in completing our mission."

Mr. Chanda said, "Given the past relations between the two countries and the gratifying understanding established by the leaders of both countries, the success of cultural cooperation is guaranteed. May the strength and significance of mutual understanding and cooperation between China and India grow day by day. May we set an example and model for peaceful cooperation between all countries. Long live China-India friendship!"

    印度文化代表团团长钱达发表广播演说
    新华社十七日讯　印度文化代表团团长阿·库·钱达先生今日晚间在北京中央人民广播电台向中国人民发表广播演说。
    钱达先生说：“让我代表印度文化代表团向你们转达印度人民的亲切的问候和真挚的祝贺。我们给你们带来了和平和友谊的祝辞。自从我们到达的那一刻起，中国人民给予我们的自发的欢迎，表现了你们对于印度和印度人民的热烈的友情。当然，也许可以说，这种欢迎并不是出乎意料之外的，因为我们的友谊在两国悠久的历史上是根深蒂固的。自古以来，中印两国就一直是彼此了解和彼此尊敬的。”
    钱达先生说，随着新印度和新中国的诞生，这种古老友谊的关系又正在恢复起来了。“但是，我们目前的任务，决不仅仅是恢复过去所有的东西，甚至也不是在过去的传统上来有所建树。条件已经改变了，环境也随着改变了。今天，我们比过去任何时候都更加相信文化是不分疆界的。当印度和中国将各自的成就相互交流时，它们都意识到这种交流是在新世界的新环境下进行的。”
    钱达先生说：“当我们各以自己的方式进一步发展着各自的经济、社会和政治的时候，和平合作，特别是文化方面的合作，就一定会发展。在过去这几天里，我们清楚地看到了两国之间文化合作正在发展的证明。但是我们前面的路程还是很长的。自从我们在我们的国家里成为自身命运的主人以来，我们的文化交流还没有来得及很好的发展。虽然如此，即使是这些有限的接触也已经产生了最有兴味的和令人鼓舞的成绩。在我们两国，都有友好协会，使得我们两国更加接近。在印度，人民对印中友好协会表现了很大的兴趣。它的影响正在日益增长着，许多卓越的思想家、作家和艺术家都支持它。在你们的国家里，中印友好协会也在发展着。各种代表团的互相访问正在巩固着印中两国之间的文化合作。我真诚地希望我荣幸地领导着的这个代表团将成为我们两国间文化锁链上的又一个环节。”
    钱达先生说：“我们代表团里有古典和民间艺术的代表人物。这些艺术家们是来自全国不同地区的。他们带来了自己地区那些艺术形式的特殊风格。这一切构成了丰富多采的印度文化。我们将尽力把印度文化的基本统一性以及它的和谐之美传达给中国人民。现在我们已经演出了几次，承蒙大家给予诚恳的欢迎，给了我们很大的鼓舞。在今后两个月里，我们将到你们伟大国家的各地去旅行。能够把我们国家的文化概略地介绍到那些地区去，对我们说来是很愉快的一件事。有了你们的友情和支持，我们对于完成任务是怀着信心的。”
    钱达先生说：“鉴于两国过去的关系和现在两国的领袖所建立的值得庆幸的谅解，文化合作的成功是有保证的。愿中印两国互相谅解与合作的力量和意义日益增长。愿我们为各国之间的和平合作树立榜样和典范。中印友谊万岁！”（附图片）
