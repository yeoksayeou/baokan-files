The Youth League organization of the Harbin Flax Textile Factory, with the help of the Party organization and administrative leaders, has been learning from the example of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League since last year and has established four youth supervision posts in the four workshops of the spinning mill to promote production.

The youth supervision post is an organizational form that unites the broad masses of young people to actively serve production. Any young person who is active in work, progressive in thought, has a certain technical level, enjoys prestige among the masses, and dares to fight against phenomena that harm national interests can participate. There are a total of thirty-three supervisors in the youth supervision posts of the spinning mill.

The youth supervision posts regularly publish blackboards in the most conspicuous places in each workshop, sharply exposing shortcomings and errors in production and proposing initiatives on how to eliminate these shortcomings and errors.

Last year, one morning, the cleaning team leader took two young workers to the spinning workshop to clean. The two young workers pulled a cart of steel spindles to wash off the dust. They overturned the cart on a bumpy spot, breaking two spindles and bending four, causing a loss of 360 yuan. The team leader knew that running around in the workshop was a violation of labor discipline but just laughed it off. After the youth supervision post discovered this situation, they drew several cartoons depicting the situation at the time, calculated the value of the loss, and published it on the blackboard of the supervision post in front of the spinning mill. The title was "Losses Caused by Not Abiding by Labor Discipline and Not Cherishing National Property." At noon when workers got off work, the blackboard was surrounded by workers who unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with this behavior of not cherishing national property, and those who were criticized felt uneasy. The cleaning team leader quickly made a self-criticism, and the two young workers who made the mistake were also educated. Afterwards, one of the workers said to the supervisor: Every day when I go to work and pass by the blackboard, I remember the mistake I made.

This criticism attracted the attention of the broad masses of workers, and no similar situation occurred for nearly a year afterwards.

In addition to carrying out criticism, the youth supervision post often adopts the method of making "suggestions" to point out errors and shortcomings in production and propose improvement opinions. In the first quarter of this year, due to some workers not complying with operating procedures, there were many "big belly yarns." It is estimated that more than 300 meters of cloth woven with "big belly yarn" cannot be used each month, resulting in a loss of more than 900 yuan. One day in March this year, the youth supervision post of the pre-spinning workshop pointed out on the blackboard that the comrades working on the No. 1 roving frame were not doing a good job and had spun a lot of bad yarn, which caused the "big belly." The supervision post suggested that the comrades working on the No. 1 machine should concentrate, take care of everything, and follow a certain patrol route. This sincere suggestion alerted all spinning workers. Since then, big belly yarn has gradually decreased and has now been completely eliminated.

The youth supervision post often adopts the method of sending "signals" to give advance warnings of possible accidents, avoiding many errors. The youth supervision post adopts the method of patient persuasion and specific help when carrying out communist education for young workers. Once last year, the attendance rate of workers in the post-spinning workshop gradually decreased, the phenomenon of machine parts damage was serious, more than a dozen steel spindles were damaged each month, and the production task was not completed. After the youth supervision post discovered this, they sent supervisors to the workers' dormitories. In the dormitory, the supervisors found that about thirty workers on sick leave were preparing to go out to play, so they had an individual talk with Wang Zuozhi, a leading watchman among them. With the sincere help of the youth supervision post, Wang Zuozhi said what was on his mind: he felt that he could not learn anything as a watchman in the flax factory and wanted to go home to participate in fishery production. Most of the other twenty workers were also transferred from other places, and some were not at ease with production because marriage problems or unsuitable work had not been resolved in time. According to this situation, the youth supervision post suggested that the Party and the administration actively take effective measures to reasonably allocate work; suggested that the League organization carry out extensive ideological education for the broad masses of young workers and help workers buy many educational books and periodicals. After being educated, Wang Zuozhi quickly corrected his work attitude and took the lead in production actively. He joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League not long ago. Now, the post-spinning workshop can overfulfill its tasks every month, and the phenomenon of machine damage no longer exists.

The youth supervision post cares about the demands of the broad masses of workers in production and life. For example, most of the workers in the wet spinning workshop suffered from arthritis, so the youth supervision post promptly invited doctors to diagnose and find out the cause of arthritis and medical methods. The youth supervision post requires every supervisor to influence and educate the broad masses of young workers with their own exemplary actions. Therefore, the supervision post also plays an active role in cultivating the communist moral qualities of the supervisors. There was such a thing: Supervisor Li Guizhen, once was slightly careless in her work and made a loophole, discovering eight or ninety missing yarns in a hank of yarn. She was very alarmed. In order to remedy this shortcoming, she took dozens of yarns from a complete hank of yarn that had been inspected and was ready to be shipped, and added them to the missing hank, trying to hide it. Her behavior was not seen by others, but it became her ideological burden. She felt that this shameful behavior was incompatible with the glorious title of youth supervisor. After an internal struggle, she reported her mistake to Guo Zhenhua, the group leader of the Youth League supervision post, and automatically wrote a written review, which was published on the Youth League supervision post's blackboard.

    哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂的青年监督岗
    戴月
    哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂的青年团组织，在党组织和行政领导的帮助下，从去年起，学习苏联列宁共产主义青年团的榜样，在纺纱场的四个车间里建立了四组青年监督岗，推动生产。
    青年监督岗是团结广大青年积极为生产服务的一种组织形式，凡工作积极、思想进步、有一定的技术水平、在群众中有威信、又勇于向危害国家利益现象作斗争的青年，都可以参加。纺纱场的青年监督岗共有三十三名监督员。
    青年监督岗在每个车间最明显的地方经常出版黑板报，尖锐地揭发生产中的缺点和错误，并提出如何消除这些缺点和错误的倡议。
    去年，一天上午，清扫队长带着两名青年工人到纺纱车间清扫。两个青年工人拉着一车钢锭子跑去洗尘。路过一块不平的地方就把车子跑翻了，摔断了两根锭子，摔曲了四根，损失价值是三百六十元。队长明知在车间里乱跑是违犯劳动纪律的，却哈哈一笑就过去了。青年监督岗发现这个情况以后，就把当时的情况画了几幅漫画，把损失的价值算了一笔账，发表在纺纱场门前监督岗的黑板报上。题目是“不遵守劳动纪律、不爱护国家财产而造成的损失”。中午下班时黑板报被职工围起来了，对这种不爱护国家财产的行为一致不满，被批评者坐立不安。清扫队长很快作了检讨，那两个犯错误的青年工人也受到教育。事后，其中有一个工人向监督员说：我每天上班路过黑板报时就想起我犯的错误。
    这个批评，引起了广大职工的注意，此后将近一年没有发生类似的情况。
    除了开展批评以外，青年监督岗经常采取提“建议”的方式，指出生产中的错误和缺点，并提出改进的意见。在今年第一季度里，由于有的工人不遵守操作规程，“大肚纱”很多。据估计，每月有用“大肚纱”织成的三百多公尺布不能用，损失价值达九百多元。今年三月间有一天，前纺车间青年监督岗就在黑板报上指出在一号粗纱机上工作的同志们工作不好，把许多纱纺坏了，才造成“大肚子”。监督岗建议在一号机上工作的同志操作时要精神贯注、全面照顾，要遵循一定的巡回路线。这个诚恳的建议警惕了全体纺纱工人。从此大肚纱逐渐减少，现在已全部消灭了。
    青年监督岗经常采取发“信号”的方式，对可能发生的事故预先提出警告，避免了许多错误的发生。青年监督岗在对青年工人进行共产主义教育时，采取了耐心说服和具体帮助的办法。去年有一次，后纺车间工人出勤率逐渐降低，机器零件损坏现象严重，每月损坏钢锭子十多根，生产任务完不成。青年监督岗发现后，就派监督员深入到工人宿舍去，在宿舍里，监督员发现请病假的三十来名工人正准备出去玩，就跟其中带头的一名看车工王作志进行个别谈话。在青年监督岗诚恳的帮助下，王作志说出了心里的话：认为在亚麻厂当看车工学不到啥，想回家参加渔业生产。其余二十多名工人，大部分也是从外地调来，有的因为婚姻问题，有的因为工作不合适未能及时得到解决，都不安心生产。青年监督岗根据这种情况，建议党和行政积极采取有效措施，合理调配工作；建议团的组织对广大青年工人进行广泛的思想教育，帮助工人买了很多有教育意义的书刊。王作志经过教育后很快端正了工作态度，积极带头生产，不久前已参加了中国新民主主义青年团。现在，后纺车间每月都能超额完成任务，损坏机器的现象也不存在了。
    青年监督岗关心广大职工群众在生产上和生活上的要求。例如，湿纺车间工人大部分得了关节炎，青年监督岗就及时地请医生诊断，找出患关节炎的原因和医疗办法。青年监督岗要求每一个监督员必须以自己的模范行动影响和教育广大的青年职工。因此，监督岗对培养监督员的共产主义道德品质也起了积极作用。有过这样一件事：监督员李桂珍，有一次在工作中稍不注意，出了漏洞，在一绞纱里发现缺八、九十根纱。她很惊慌，为了补救这个缺点，从检查过准备运走的一绞完整的纱里抽出几十根来，补到缺少的那绞里，企图瞒过去。她的行为并没有被别人看见，可是却变成了她的思想负担。她感到这种可耻的行为同青年监督员的光荣称号是不相容的。经过一番内心的斗争，她把自己的错误报告青年团监督岗小组长郭振华，并自动的写了书面检讨，发表在青年团监督岗的黑板报上。
