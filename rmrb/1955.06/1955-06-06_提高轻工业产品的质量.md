Improving the Quality of Light Industrial Products
	Wan Hong

	Low and unstable product quality is a rather serious problem existing in the current production of light industrial enterprises.

	Taking the state-owned pharmaceutical industry as an example, the four products—procaine penicillin, penicillin oil, injections, and tablets—which account for more than 40 percent of the planned output value of pharmaceuticals, have what is called "three excesses," namely, excess of defective products, excess of rework, and excess of returned goods after leaving the factory. In the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory, more than 57 percent of the contaminated products produced in September of last year were substandard. Among the 70 commonly used types of tablets, about 45 types are frequently reworked or returned due to disintegration failure, mold, insufficient content, etc. Other problems, such as poor quality of automobile cushion belts, excessive dust and insufficient smoothness of certain types of paper, and turbid beer, have not been resolved for a long time. Most light industrial products are directly needed for people's lives, and poor quality can easily cause dissatisfaction among consumers, which will reduce the credibility of state-owned enterprise products among the people. At the same time, poor quality also causes serious economic losses to the factories themselves. It is estimated that last year, the state-owned biochemical pharmaceutical factory lost more than 700,000 yuan due to the poor quality of penicillin oil alone.

	In response to this situation, the Ministry of Light Industry has made improving product quality one of the main goals of the production activities of its affiliated enterprises this year. There is no doubt that this is completely correct. However, in some factories, some engineering and technical personnel are not concerned enough about improving product quality, believing that improving product quality does not contribute as significantly to the country as increasing output. Some of them even lament, "A hero has no place to use his skills!"

	This idea is wrong, and we can illustrate it with just one example. The National Rubber Industry Technological Innovation Experience Exchange Conference, convened by the Ministry of Light Industry and other leading organs at the end of November and the beginning of December 1954, decided that in 1955, rubber industrial enterprises across the country would increase the average mileage of automobile tires to 25,000 to 30,000 kilometers, and extend the wearing time of rubber shoes by 20 to 30 days. Tires and rubber shoes with improved quality, in terms of their actual effect, are equivalent to increasing output by about one-quarter to one-fifth compared to products of the original quality, creating more than 130 million yuan of wealth for the country. With this wealth, five modern cotton textile factories with a scale of 50,000 spindles can be built. Can it be said that such a thing is meaningless or of little significance?

	Therefore, for any engineering and technical personnel, improving product quality is by no means a situation where "a hero has no place to use his skills," but precisely the time for "a hero to use his skills!"

### 提高轻工业产品的质量

    提高轻工业产品的质量
    万红
    产品质量低、不稳定，是轻工业企业当前生产中存在着的一个比较严重的问题。
    以国营制药工业为例，占药品产值计划百分之四十以上的普鲁卡因青霉素、青霉素油剂、针剂、片剂等四种产品，有所谓“三多”，即废品多、返工多和出厂后退货多。国营上海第三制药厂去年九月出产的染菌品，不合规格的占百分之五十七以上。常用的七十种片剂中，约有四十五种经常因崩解度不合格、发霉、含量不足等情况而返工和退货。其他如汽车垫带质量差，某些纸张的尘埃大、光滑度不够，啤酒混浊，等等，都是长期没解决的问题。轻工业产品大都是直接为人民生活所需要的，质量不好就容易引起消费者的不满，就会降低国营企业产品在人民群众中的信誉。同时质量不好也给工厂本身造成经济上的严重损失，据估计，去年国营生化药厂仅因青霉素油剂的质量不好，就损失七十多万元。
    针对这种情况，轻工业部把提高产品质量作为今年所属企业生产活动的主要目标之一。毫无疑问，这是完全正确的。但是，在一些工厂里，有些工程技术人员对提高产品质量却不够关心。认为提高产品质量对国家的贡献没有增加产量那样显著。其中有的人甚至感叹地说：“英雄无用武之地！”
    这种想法是错误的，我们只要举一个例子就可说明。一九五四年十一月底十二月初，轻工业部等领导机关所召开的全国橡胶工业技术革新经验交流大会，决定一九五五年全国橡胶工业企业，把汽车轮胎的平均行驶里程提高到二万五千公里到三万公里，胶鞋的穿用时间延长二十天到三十天。提高质量以后的轮胎和胶鞋，按它们的实际效果来说，比起原来质量的产品效果来，就等于增加了四分之一至五分之一左右的产量，即为国家多创造一亿三千多万元的财富，用这些财富，可以建设五个具有五万枚纱锭规模的现代棉纺织厂。能够说这样的事没有意义或者意义不大吗？
    因此，对于任何一个工程技术人员，提高产品质量绝不是“英雄无用武之地”，而正是“英雄用武”的时候！
