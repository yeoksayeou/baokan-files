　　苏加诺总统谈亚非两洲争取独立的斗争
    新华社雅加达三十一日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺二十九日在一次集会上说，在争取和保卫独立的斗争中，亚非两洲在精神上和目标上是完全一致的。他说，亚非两洲的觉醒有“一个共同的纲领”，就是利益的一致和共同为挣脱殖民主义及帝国主义的桎梏而斗争。他说，亚非国家在争取自由的斗争中是互相依赖的。
    苏加诺相信，在亚非会议以后，会有更重大和具体的步骤。他认为，沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理到中国访问和他预定的到巴基斯坦、埃及和沙特阿拉伯的访问，是按照亚非会议的总的愿望使亚非国家的友好关系更加密切的进一步步骤。
    苏加诺说，亚非人民决心取得独立和繁荣的精神和意志，是绝对阻碍不了的。
