Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 13th: National People's Congress deputies who are conducting inspection work in Tianjin are going deep into grassroots units for inspection.

    Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, inspected the labor reform work of prisoners in Tianjin on the 13th. Liu Changfu and four other National People's Congress deputies have inspected five factories and talked with many workers, technicians, and labor models. At the Tianjin Municipal State-Owned Zhonghua Match Factory, the deputies went to the cooling room and studied the problem of improving match quality with the technicians. At the Tianjin Knitting Factory, the deputies heard the opinions of the staff and workers on improving the style of woolen sweaters and eliminating the impractical pockets on the sweaters, which could save more than 300,000 yuan in half a year. At the same time, they suggested that the staff and workers first produce samples and submit them to the Materials Exchange Conference for exhibition and evaluation. Deputy Fu Hongbin is a labor model among construction workers in Tianjin. When he went to the construction site of the Tianjin Gymnasium, which is under construction, he was warmly welcomed by the workers. The workers also reported to him the waste phenomena in the project. When Deputy Luo Yun and others inspected the grain warehouse, in addition to answering her questions, the staff and workers also guaranteed to do a good job in grain storage.

    Sun Qimeng, a National People's Congress deputy from Beijing, inspected the socialist transformation of private capitalist industry and commerce in Tianjin. Deputy Tian Demin is inspecting the situation in the industrial and educational sectors.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 13th: Some of the National People's Congress deputies who are conducting inspection work in Shanghai are conducting in-depth inspections of industrial production and grain work.

    Hu Juewen, Cao Jinghua and fourteen other National People's Congress deputies conducted three inspections at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. The deputies learned that this factory only manufactured the simplest agricultural tools before liberation. After liberation, it has produced twelve kinds of precision grinding machines, supplying hundreds of industrial and mining enterprises and scientific research institutions across the country. The deputies also inquired in detail about the production technology, financial management, and workers' living welfare, and put forward opinions on the shortcomings in the maintenance of machine tools. Among the deputies, Chen Shiying, Vice President of Jiaotong University, also specifically inquired whether university graduates were assigned jobs in the factory according to their majors. Li Wenyu, Deputy Director of the Labor Protection Department of the Ministry of Labor, investigated labor protection and living welfare, and put forward suggestions for improving the lighting and lighting equipment of the old factory buildings.

    Jiang Yong, Jin Zhonghua, Wu Yaozong, Yang Yitang, Qian Duansheng and thirteen other National People's Congress deputies who inspected grain work in Shanghai mostly went deep into neighborhoods, government offices, factories, grain depots, flour mills, rice mills, restaurants, food factories, grain stores, and suburban areas for inspection. According to the results of the inspection, the deputies put forward suggestions to the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee for improving grain work. They believed that Shanghai should further strengthen the publicity and education work on saving grain, and the phenomenon that some residents have subscribed to grain plans that are too high should be changed. Education, inspection and supervision should be strengthened for food units with the idea of "being generous when ordering, and frugal when using". Further understanding and investigation should be made on the actual grain needs of the city's citizens. The deputies also unanimously proposed that saving grain and opposing waste is a regular matter, and it is necessary to prevent the "gust of wind" approach. The deputies also put forward many suggestions for improvement in grain storage, processing, and supply. Now, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee is preparing to report the opinions put forward by the deputies to the relevant leading organs; those that can be implemented immediately will be immediately notified to the relevant departments for implementation.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: Some of the National People's Congress deputies are inspecting work in the minority areas of Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and Yunnan.

    In the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, the National People's Congress deputy Suo Guanying and others organized an inspection team to inspect the situation after the opening of the Cheng'a Highway from Weizhou to Haiziba, as well as the achievements of farmers of all ethnic groups in Wenchuan County, Maoxian County and other places in production reform. They also went to the first state-owned mechanical farm on the grassland, the Longriba Farm, for inspection.

    Gu Yuan and other National People's Congress deputies who came to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for inspection are inspecting the summer pastures of the nationally famous Huhele Tai Livestock Production Cooperative on the Hulunbuir Grassland. They visited the new and old members of the cooperative, model sanitation households, and mothers with eight children. The director of the cooperative introduced the development of the cooperative and this year's lambing situation to the deputies.

    National People's Congress deputies in the border areas of Yunnan are inspecting the ethnic work in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture and other places.
