Thoroughly Eliminate Counter-Revolutionary Elements
Xia Zhengong

Since the "People's Daily" published the three batches of materials on the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng clique, this counter-revolutionary group hidden within the revolutionary ranks has been completely exposed. Their crimes have aroused the anger of the people across the country, who unanimously demand a thorough investigation into the origins of this counter-revolutionary group! Now, after reading the third batch of materials, its origins are completely clear. It turns out that Hu Feng and the core members of his group are loyal running dogs of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

Having understood the origins of Hu Feng and his group, we can see even more clearly that Hu Feng is extremely hostile and wantonly slanders the Communist Party and the revolutionary cause it leads. They were active participants in the anti-people civil war launched by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and their hands are stained with the blood of the Chinese people! This Hu Feng spy group must be completely destroyed! The principal offender Hu Feng and the Hu Feng elements who refuse to confess thoroughly must be severely punished according to law!

This spy Hu Feng, disguised as a Marxist, sneaked into the left-wing literary camp and deceived us for more than twenty years. We must profoundly learn this lesson. We were not vigilant enough against this hidden counter-revolutionary element. No matter how well Hu Feng and his group disguised themselves, their fox tails were still exposed. Take Hu Feng as an example: he opposed everything the Party advocated and proposed, he opposed everyone who showed closeness to the Party, and he opposed all organizations and work led by the Party, and he did so for twenty years! Could there be such a progressive person? Can this be explained as a matter of ideology? Take Liu Xuewei, a member of the Hu Feng group who sneaked into the Party, for example. When he was in East China, he openly opposed literature serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposed portraying workers, peasants, and soldiers, and opposed popularization, which meant opposing the Party's literary direction. He did not believe in the Party but believed in Hu Feng. He did not believe in the Party's proposals but believed in Hu Feng's proposals. Could there really be such a "Party member"? Can this be explained as a matter of ideology? As long as our sense of smell is slightly more sensitive, the bloody smell on them could have been detected long ago. We must learn this lesson, strengthen our political and theoretical studies, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, and learn to identify true revolutionaries from false revolutionaries, true Marxists from false Marxists. When our Party is leading the people of the whole country to carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation with full confidence, one of the most vicious means of the enemy is to pretend to be progressive and sneak into the revolutionary ranks to sabotage from within. In order to ensure the victory of the socialist cause, we must not only thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, but also completely eliminate all other hidden counter-revolutionary elements!

We must warn the members of the Hu Feng group and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements that no matter how you disguise yourselves, you will never escape the eyes of the people. Your disguise will eventually be stripped off by the people! Your only way out is to immediately bow your heads and confess your crimes to the people!

    彻底肃清反革命分子
    夏征农
    自“人民日报”公布了关于胡风集团的反革命罪行的三批材料后，这个隐藏在革命阵营内的反革命集团，原形毕露了。他们的罪行，激起了全国人民的愤怒，一致要求彻底追查这个反革命集团的来历！现在，看了第三批材料，它的来历是完全清楚了。原来胡风及其集团的骨干是帝国主义、蒋匪帮的忠实走狗。
    明白了胡风及其集团的来历，我们就更清楚地看到，胡风对共产党和它所领导的革命事业，是极端仇视和肆意污蔑的。他们是蒋匪帮发动反人民的内战的积极参与者，他们的手上沾满了中国人民的血！对于胡风这个特务集团，必须彻底摧毁！对于主犯胡风以及不肯彻底坦白的胡风分子，必须依法严办！
    胡风这个特务，伪装马克思主义者，混进左翼文艺阵营，欺骗了我们二十多年，我们不能不深刻地接受这个教训。对于这个暗藏的反革命分子，我们是警惕不高的。不管胡风及其集团伪装得怎样好，他的狐狸尾巴还是露出来了。拿胡风来说，凡是党所提倡所主张的，他都反对，凡是表示靠近党的人他都反对，凡是党所领导的团体和工作他都反对，而且二十年如一日！难道会有这样的进步分子吗？这能解释为思想问题吗？再拿混进党内的胡风集团分子刘雪苇来说，他在华东时，一直公开反对文艺为工农兵服务，反对描写工农兵，反对普及，也就是反对党的文艺方向，不相信党，而相信胡风，不相信党的主张，而相信胡风的主张，难道真的会有这样“党员”吗？这能解释为思想问题吗？只要我们的嗅觉稍为灵敏一点，他们身上的血腥味是早就可以嗅出来的。我们必须接受这个教训，加强政治理论学习，百倍提高警惕，学会识别真革命者和假革命者，真马克思主义者和假马克思主义者。当我们的党正在领导全国人民满怀信心地进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的时候，敌人最毒辣的手段之一，就是假装进步，混进革命阵营来，从中进行破坏。为了保证社会主义事业的胜利，我们不仅要彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，而且要彻底消灭其他一切暗藏的反革命分子！
    要警告胡风集团分子和一切暗藏的反革命分子，不管你们怎样伪装，你们决逃不出人民的眼睛。你们的伪装，是终究要被人民剥下来的！你们唯一的出路就是立即向人民俯首认罪！
