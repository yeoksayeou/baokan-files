    Soviet Steelmaking Operation Processes Continuously Innovating
    The Soviet Union's steelmaking operations are innovating at an ever-increasing pace.
    The hot water cooling method for open-hearth furnaces, pioneered by the Soviet Union, has immense economic value. Steelworkers use the factory's waste steam to preheat the cold water used for cooling the open-hearth furnace, gradually lowering the temperature of the furnace instead of directly using cold water for cooling. The "Hammer and Sickle" steel factory in Moscow adopted this method, reducing water and steam consumption by dozens of times. The Makayevka Steel Plant and the Kramatorsk Metallurgical Plant adopted this method during steelmaking, extending the lifespan of the open-hearth furnace's embankments, furnace frames, and other parts by three to four times. According to statistics, if more than one hundred open-hearth furnaces adopted this advanced method, it could save the country more than 500 million rubles annually.
    In terms of rapid steelmaking, advanced workers at the Zaporozhye Steel Plant improved the methods of rapid charging and rapid heating of furnace materials, greatly saving steelmaking time. They first place the lighter materials on the entire furnace bottom and then place the heavier materials, which require a large amount of heat, in the area of the furnace with the most intense flames. At the same time, during charging, they maintain the melting temperature of the previous furnace, so that the furnace material of the next furnace is subjected to high heat from the very first few minutes. This can save 25 to 30 percent of the time in this process. In addition, during the work process, they strictly abide by the operating rules of the open-hearth furnace, protecting the furnace arch from overheating combustion and repairing the furnace walls in a timely and precise manner, so that the furnace arch has withstood more than seventy-five more melts than other furnace arches. Just by reducing downtime for repairs, an additional three thousand tons of steel were produced. The Soviet Union widely utilizes atomic energy in medicine.
    A recent article in the Soviet "Izvestia" by Professor Olekhovich, Academician of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, summarized the great achievements of the Soviet Union in the utilization of atomic energy in medicine.
    When discussing the use of radioactive isotopes to study metabolic processes, the article pointed out: The tracer atom method can be used to solve some major problems, such as understanding the processes of synthesis, decomposition, and changes in proteins, fats, carbohydrates, inorganic substances, clarifying the mechanism of action of hormones and vitamins, and studying the impact of antibiotics and other drugs, poisons, and bacterial toxins on the body. Radioactive isotopes can also be used to study the functional characteristics of various organs during illness.
    The article pointed out that due to the adoption of the tracer atom method, it has now been proven that the bodies of humans, animals, and plants are constantly renewed throughout their entire lives. The molecules of chemical substances that make up the body are constantly destroyed and replaced by newly synthesized molecules. All parts of the human body, including tissues that are considered inactive, such as bones, teeth, and tendons, also undergo renewal.
    The use of new methods helps to discover the mechanisms that regulate the life processes in the body and to understand the essence of the disruption of this process's normal operation.
    In this way, a new path has been opened for fighting various diseases. Radioactive cobalt is a powerful and effective drug for treating skin cancer, lower layer cancer, tongue cancer, and throat cancer. In the treatment of breast cancer and other malignant tumors, cobalt can be used in conjunction with hormone surgical methods. Some of the most promising materials have been obtained in the treatment of chronic granulocytic leukemia with radioactive phosphorus. Phosphorus isotopes have also been used in the treatment of polycythemia vera. Radioactive iodine has also been very successful in the treatment of thyroid diseases. The Soviet Union will produce more than two hundred films in two years.
    The Soviet Union will produce more than two hundred new films in 1955-1956. This is stipulated in the film production plan approved by the Soviet Ministry of Culture.
    The plan pointed out that the themes of the new films will be diverse. New films describing the life of the working class, the struggle of collective farmers to greatly increase agriculture, and the alliance of workers and peasants include: "Donbass," "Virgin Soil," and "The Story of an Agronomist," etc., which are adapted from novels by Gorbatov, Pogodin, and Nikolayeva. Films with the theme of revolutionary struggle include "Prologue," "On the Fortresses of Moscow," and "The Great October." In addition, there are many films with the theme of the friendship of various nationalities in the Soviet Union and the struggle for peace.
    The most important of the new adaptations will be: Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace," Gogol's "Taras Bulba," Gorky's "Mother," Alexei Tolstoy's "The Road to Calvary," Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered," Cervantes's "Don Quixote," and Shakespeare's "Othello."
    The new films include not only historical films and feature films but also musical films, adventure and science fiction films, as well as many films specially made for children and young people. North Korea's Sup'ung Dam Power Plant Rapidly Restored and Expanded
    North Korea's largest Sup'ung Dam Power Plant is being restored and expanded at the fastest possible speed.
    In this power plant, with the fraternal assistance of Soviet technicians, the sixth generator has been assembled and is about to begin generating electricity. The repair and assembly of other generators are also underway.
    The electricity generated by this power plant this year will increase by 25 percent compared to before the war and by 194.8 percent compared to when the truce was first signed.
    Many generators have been repaired at the Hochon River, Jangjin River, and Pujon River power plants. The Puryong and Geumgangsan power plants are also rapidly recovering. According to the plan, the electricity generated by various power plants will increase to 386.7 percent of the 1953 level by the end of this year.
    Vietnam's Summer Rice Harvest Will Increase by Half Compared to Last Year
    The northern part of Vietnam is undergoing its first summer harvest after the restoration of peace. According to personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, this year's summer rice production will increase by about 50 percent compared to last year.
    Nam Dinh, Ha Nam, Ha Dong, Vinh Phuc, Bac Ninh and other provinces have better harvests. In the old liberated areas of northern Vietnam, the summer rice production in many places has already reached or exceeded the previous level last year. This year, many townships have increased production by another 5 to 10 percent.
    Some areas have suffered from drought this year, but due to the local people's construction of small-scale water conservancy projects with the help of the government, they can also obtain better harvests.
    Personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Vietnam said that the reasons for the better summer rice harvest this year are: the planting area of summer rice has been expanded, many water conservancy projects repaired after the ceasefire have been completed and started irrigation, the farming time has been increased compared to before, and the early-maturing "Nanning Rice" aided by the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people has enabled areas that have exceeded the summer rice planting time to also sow and harvest. Poland Discovers Rich Iron Ore and Lead-Zinc Deposits
    Poland has recently discovered rich iron ore and lead-zinc deposits.
    Polish geologists recently discovered an iron ore deposit thirty kilometers long and three to eight kilometers wide in the Lezajsk area of the Lodz Province. The ore deposit is much thicker and more valuable than other known iron ore deposits in Poland. The results of tests conducted by the Polish Geological Institute proved that the iron ore sand produced in Lezajsk is easy to smelt, and mining the iron ore sand in this area will be much cheaper than in other areas.
    New lead-zinc deposits have been discovered in the Silesia-Krakow area. These deposits are among the larger deposits in the world in terms of distribution area and concentration. Three giant lead-zinc mines are currently under construction near Olkusz and Chrzanow. After these mines are all put into production, the ore sand they produce will be equal to one and a half times the output of all such mines in Poland before the war. Czech Youth Volunteer to Participate in Land Reclamation Work
    By the end of May, among the 16,000 young people in Czechoslovakia who volunteered to participate in land reclamation work in the border areas, 10,300 young people had arrived at their destinations and participated in the work of state-owned farms and machine tractor stations there.
    Many young land reclamation teams have already achieved good results in their work and have been rewarded. For example, the Dian working team, which is four-fifths female youth, won the prize banner from the Usti Region Youth League organization because they successfully completed the farmland and fertilization plan in the spring plowing. A youth land reclamation team composed of 250 people also played a major role in the spring sowing work of the Ho Tiin State Farm in the Pilsen Region. Their active labor made this state-owned farm, which owns 10,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare), the first farm in the entire region to complete the grain sowing plan, and enabled the farm's potato planting plan to be completed five days ahead of schedule. Hungary's Construction Industry Achieves Great Progress
    Hungary's construction industry has made great progress in the ten years since liberation. The production value of the construction industry and the building materials industry has now increased to fourteen times that of 1948. Hungarian construction workers are learning advanced Soviet methods, implementing mechanization in construction, eliminating the seasonality of construction, and also adopting precast concrete panels.
    During the first Five-Year Plan (1950-1954), Hungarian workers built entire cities and residential areas, huge industrial enterprises, schools, hospitals, and clubs, and built 320 kilometers of concrete-paved roads, 1,300 kilometers of rural roads, and rebuilt a total of 48.5 kilometers of bridges, etc. Bulgaria Continues to Expand Basic Construction Tasks
    Bulgaria continues to expand the task of basic construction. The total amount of construction and installation work this year will increase by 7.5 percent compared to last year. Industrial investment during the second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) will increase to twice that of the first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953). During the second Five-Year Plan, the industrial enterprises that will be completed and put into production will include: the Batak Hydropower Complex Hub, the "Studen Kladenets" Reservoir, a cement factory with an annual output of 300,000 tons of cement, a spare parts factory, a sugar factory, the second part of the "Lenin" National Metallurgical Plant, as well as several new large coal mines and other mines. During this period, a number of projects that had already begun construction during the first Five-Year Plan will also be completed, such as the Stalin Hydropower Complex Hub, the lead-zinc factory, the second part of the Karl Marx Soda Ash Factory, the refractory materials factory, and other factories. Albania Develops Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Albanian agricultural production cooperatives have increased production and income, greatly promoting the development of the cooperative movement.
    Last year, the average unit area yield of wheat in Albanian agricultural production cooperatives was 24 percent higher than that of individual farmers, cotton was 112 percent higher, and corn was 21.8 percent higher. Among the 150 agricultural production cooperatives in the country, two-thirds of the cooperatives have become wealthy cooperatives with an income of more than one million lek (Albanian currency), of which 15 cooperatives have an income of more than three million lek, and nine cooperatives have an income of more than five million lek. More than 660 cooperative members have already built new houses, and hundreds of members are currently building new houses.
    Because the cooperative has shown its superiority, more and more individual farmers are demanding the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. Now, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in Albania has increased by 35 percent compared to the beginning of last year. In addition to agricultural production cooperatives, Albania has also launched a simpler form of collective economy - co-farming societies. One hundred and forty co-farming societies have been established since October of last year alone. Many co-farming societies are also preparing to transition to agricultural production cooperatives in the near future. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联炼钢操作过程不断革新
    苏联的炼钢操作过程，在日新月异地革新中。
    苏联首创的平炉热水冷却法，有巨大的经济价值。炼钢工人们利用工厂的废汽来预热冷却平炉的冷水，使平炉逐步降温，而不直接用冷水来冷却平炉。莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂采用了这种方法，使水和蒸汽的消耗减少了几十倍。马卡耶夫卡钢铁工厂和克拉马托尔斯克冶金工厂在炼钢时采用了这种方法，使平炉的围堰、炉架和其他部分的寿命延长了三、四倍。根据统计，如果有一百多个平炉采用这种先进方法，每年就能够为国家节省五亿多卢布的资金。
    在快速炼钢方面，萨坡罗什炼钢厂的先进工人改进了快速装料和炉料快速加热的方法，大大节省了炼钢时间。他们先把较轻的料放到整个炉底上，而把需要大量热度的较重的料，放在炉内火焰最猛烈的地方。同时，装料时保持上一炉的熔炼温度，使下一炉的炉料从最初几分钟起就受到高热。这样，可以节省这一过程的时间百分之二十五到三十。此外，他们在工作过程中，严格遵守平炉的运用规则，保护炉拱免受过热的燃烧，及时而精确地修理炉壁，使这座平炉的炉拱比其他炉拱多经受了七十五次以上的熔炼。仅仅由于减少了修理的停工时间，就多炼了三千吨钢。苏联在医学上广泛利用原子能
    苏联“消息报”最近刊载的苏联医学科学院院士奥列霍维奇教授的一篇文章，综述了苏联在医学方面利用原子能所获得的巨大成就。
    文章在谈到利用放射性同位素来研究新陈代谢过程时指出：利用示踪原子法可以解决一些重大问题，如可以了解蛋白质、脂肪、碳水化合物、无机物质的合成、分解和变化的过程，可以阐明激素和维生素的作用的机制，可以研究抗生物质和其他药品、毒剂、细菌毒素对机体的影响。利用放射性同位素还可以研究各种器官在患病时的机能的特点。
    文章指出，由于采用了示踪原子法，现在已能证明，人和动植物的机体在整个生命过程中不断地更新。组成机体的化学物质的分子经常在破坏并且被新合成的分子所代替。人体的各部分，甚至包括被认为是不活动的组织如骨骼、牙齿、腱也都有更新的现象。
    利用新的方法，有助于发现调节机体中生命活动过程的机制，可以了解这种过程的正常进行遭到破坏的实质。
    这样一来，就打开了同各种疾病进行斗争的新的道路。放射性钴是医治皮肤癌、下层癌、舌癌、喉癌的有力和有效的药品。在治疗乳腺癌和其他恶性肿瘤时，钴可以和激素外科方法配合使用。在利用放射性磷来治疗慢性粒状白血球白血病时已获得一些最有希望的材料。在治疗红血球增多症方面也采用了磷同位素。放射性碘在治疗甲状腺病方面也很成功。苏联两年内将生产二百多部影片
    苏联在一九五五—一九五六年将生产二百多部新影片。这是苏联文化部批准的影片生产计划中规定的。
    计划指出，新影片的主题将是多种多样。描述工人阶级的生活、集体农民为大大提高农业而进行的斗争和工农联盟的新影片有：根据戈尔巴托夫·波戈金和尼古拉耶娃等人的小说改编的“顿巴斯”、“处女地”和“一个农学家的故事”等。以革命斗争为主题的影片有“序幕”、“莫斯科堡垒上”、“伟大的十月”。此外，还有许多影片以苏联各民族的友谊、争取和平的斗争为主题。
    新的改编影片中最重要的将有：列·托尔斯泰的“战争与和平”、果戈里的“塔拉斯·布尔巴”、高尔基的“母”、阿·托尔斯泰的“苦难的历程”、奥斯特洛夫斯基的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、塞万提斯的“唐吉诃德”和莎士比亚的“奥赛洛”。
    新出产的影片中不仅包括历史片、故事片，还有音乐片、冒险和科学幻想片以及为儿童和青年特制的许多影片。朝鲜水丰发电厂迅速恢复和扩建
    朝鲜最大的水丰发电厂，正在以最快的速度进行恢复和扩建。
    在这个发电厂里，靠着苏联技术人员的兄弟般的援助，第六号发电机已经装配完成，即将开始发电。其他发电机的修理和装配工作也正在进行。
    这个发电厂在今年所发的电力要比战前增加百分之二十五。比刚停战的时候增加百分之一百九十四点八。
    虚川江、长津江和赴战江等发电厂都修好了许多发电机。富宁和金刚山等发电厂也在迅速恢复中。根据计划，各发电厂发出的电力到今年年底时将增加到一九五三年的百分之三百八十六点七。
  越南夏稻将比去年增产一半
    越南北半部正在进行和平恢复后的第一个夏收。据越南民主共和国农林部人员说，今年的夏稻产量将比去年产量增加约百分之五十。
    南定、河南、河东、永福、北宁等省都有较好的收成。在越北老解放区，许多地方去年夏稻产量已经达到或超过往年水平，今年，很多乡又增产百分之五到百分之十。
    一些地区在今年曾遭受旱灾，但由于当地人民在政府帮助下兴修小型水利，也能够得到较好的收成。
    越南农林部人员说，今年夏稻获得较好收成的原因是：夏稻种植面积扩大，停战后修复的许多水利工程已经竣工和开始灌溉，耕作时间比以前增加，中国人民援助越南人民的早熟的“南宁稻”使已经超过种植夏稻时间的地区也可以播种并且得到收获。波兰发现丰富的铁矿和铅锌矿
    波兰最近发现了丰富的铁矿和铅锌矿。
    波兰地质学家在罗兹省列日查地区最近发现了一个长三十公里、宽三公里到八公里的铁矿矿床。这个铁矿的矿藏比波兰国内其他已经知道的最大的铁矿要厚得多而且更有价值。波兰地质研究所试验的结果证明，列日查出产的铁矿砂是易于熔炼的，开采这个地区的铁矿砂将比其他地区便宜得多。
    在西里西亚—克拉科夫地区，发现了新的铅锌矿。这些矿藏就分布面积和集中情况来说，都是世界上比较大的矿床。现在正在俄尔库兹和赫尔扎诺夫附近建设三个巨型的铅锌矿厂。这些矿山全部投入生产后，它们所出产的矿砂将等于波兰战前所有这类矿山产量的一倍半。捷青年志愿参加开垦荒地工作
    到五月底为止，捷克斯洛伐克志愿报名参加边境地区垦荒工作的一万六千名青年中，已经有一万零三百名青年到达目的地并且参加了那里的国营农场和机器拖拉机站的工作。
    许多青年垦荒队在工作中已经创造了良好成绩，并且受到了奖励。例如，女青年占五分之四的迪恩工作队，由于在春耕中很好地完成了耕地和施肥计划，获得了乌斯蒂州青年联盟组织的奖旗。由二百五十人组成的青年垦荒队，在比尔森州的霍·堤茵国营农场的春播工作中也发挥了很大作用。他们的积极劳动使这个拥有一万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）土地的国营农场成为全州第一个完成谷物播种计划的农场，并且使农场的马铃薯种植计划提前五天完成。匈牙利建筑工业取得巨大进展
    匈牙利建筑工业在解放后十年中有了很大发展。现在建筑工业和建筑材料工业的生产价值已经增加为一九四八年的十四倍。匈牙利建筑工人学习苏联的先进方法，在建筑上实行了机械化，消除了建筑的季节性，同时还采用了混凝土预制板。
    在第一个五年计划（一九五零—一九五四年）期间，匈牙利工人建成了整个整个的城市和住宅区、巨大的工业企业、学校、医院和俱乐部，新建了三百二十公里的混凝土路面的公路，一千三百公里乡村大路，重建了总计四十八点五公里长的桥梁等等。保加利亚不断扩大基本建设任务
    保加利亚不断扩大基本建设的任务。今年的建筑和安装工作总量将比去年增加百分之七点五。第二个五年计划（一九五三—一九五七年）的工业投资将增加为第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）的两倍。在第二个五年计划期间，建成并投入生产的工业企业将有：巴塔克水力综合工程枢纽，“斯图丹·克拉德尼茨”水库，年产量为三十万吨水泥的水泥工厂，备件工厂，制糖厂，“列宁”国家冶金工厂的第二部分，以及几个新的大采煤场和其他矿场。这期间，还将完成第一个五年计划期间已经开始兴建的一批工程，如斯大林水力综合工程枢纽，铅锌工厂，卡尔·马克思制碱工厂的第二部分，耐火材料工厂和其他工厂等。阿尔巴尼亚发展农业生产合作社
    阿尔巴尼亚农业生产合作社生产提高，收入增加，大大促进了合作化运动的发展。
    去年，阿尔巴尼亚农业生产合作社小麦的单位面积产量平均比个体农民高百分之二十四，棉花高百分之一百一十二，玉蜀黍高百分之二十一点八。在全国一百五十个农业生产合作社中，有三分之二的合作社成了收入在一百万里克（阿币名）以上的富裕合作社，其中有十五个合作社的收入超过了三百万里克，九个合作社超过了五百万里克。现在已经建筑了新住宅的社员有六百六十多家，目前还有数以百计的社员正在建筑新住宅。
    由于合作社显示了它的优越性，个体农民要求成立农业生产合作社的越来越多。现在，阿尔巴尼亚农业生产合作社的数目比去年年初增加了百分之三十五。除了农业生产合作社以外，阿尔巴尼亚还举办更简单的集体经济的形式——共耕社。单是去年十月以来成立的共耕社就有一百四十个。许多共耕社还准备在不久将来转为农业生产合作社。（据新华社讯）
