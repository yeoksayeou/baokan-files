    Reclaiming White Flowers from Garbage
    Zhu Xingfu, Shanghai Model Worker

    I have worked in the scutching room of the Shanghai No. 16 State-owned Textile Factory for decades and am now responsible for the work in this workshop. The factory's sets of cotton cleaning machines were installed by me personally twenty-five years ago. These machines take in raw cotton and spit out cotton laps and garbage. This garbage is not ordinary garbage; it always contains 30 to 40 percent cotton fibers. I also grew cotton with my parents when I was young, and I know that farmers work very hard to grow cotton. Now, a lot of useful cotton fiber is mixed in the garbage and becomes waste, which is such a pity! If we can recover more cotton fiber from the garbage, it will not only benefit the country's construction, but also be worthy of our farmer brothers.

    I wanted to find a way to increase production and practice economy in this area. Once, I participated in the Huadong Textile Bureau's maintenance work conference, where I learned a lot of advanced experience. After returning to the factory, I carefully studied the machines and found that the amount of cotton in the garbage was closely related to the airflow. I wanted to strengthen the airflow, so I installed a motor on the vertical opener to increase the fan speed from the original 1,200 revolutions per minute to 1,460 revolutions per minute. This was indeed effective, and the cotton fiber in the garbage was reduced to less than 20 percent. But the speed was too fast, the machine's bearings couldn't handle it, and it would use 3 kWh of electricity per hour. If you calculate several machines, it would use 20,000 to 30,000 kWh of electricity per year. Isn't this robbing Peter to pay Paul?

    I was very distressed about this, but the Party and the administration supported me and encouraged me to continue experimenting. This gave me even more energy. I put on my reading glasses every day to learn culture, and I also flipped through technical books to find reference materials. I came up with twenty or so ideas, and worked with technician Li Changfei to experiment many times, all of which failed. But I still didn't lose heart.

    One day, I thought of a way: remove the motor and add three wind vanes to the blade disc on the top of the machine to increase the airflow. These were all made of waste materials and did not require additional electricity. After the machine had been running for a while, we opened the machine and grabbed the garbage to take a look. Ha, it was indeed different! The garbage had turned from white to black, which means that the cotton fiber in the garbage had decreased. Later, we made some improvements together, and the cotton fiber in the garbage was reduced to about 10 percent. In April of this year, the cotton fiber in the garbage of the No. 3 porcupine opener was reduced to about 5 percent, but this is still not enough, and we must continue to work hard.

    Last year, under the leadership and support of the higher authorities, the worker brothers and I made more than a dozen improvements. The Huadong Textile Bureau also sent a working group to help me summarize my experience and promote it to fraternal factories. Now, with the efforts of all the employees in the factory, the amount of cotton used per yarn has been reduced to more than 380 jin. Last year, we saved a total of more than 100,000 jin of cotton. The fraternal factories have also reduced their cotton consumption by using this experience, and some have created even newer achievements. We must learn from them.

    Recently, our factory has begun to blend in yellow flowers, which is due to the floods that affected cotton fields in some areas last year. Yellow flowers have poor elasticity, poor tensile strength, and contain more impurities. This will inevitably increase the difficulty of our scutching work, but we have the confidence and the means to overcome these difficulties. We have adjusted some machines to strive to spin good yarn and weave good cloth with yellow flowers without increasing the amount of cotton used, to ensure the quality of our products and meet the needs of the people.

    从垃圾中夺回白花
    上海市劳动模范　朱杏福
    我在国营上海第十六纺织厂的清花间做了几十年工，现在负责这个车间的工作。厂里的几套清棉机，是我在二十五年以前亲手安装的。这些机器，吃进去的是原棉，吐出来的是棉卷和垃圾。这垃圾不是普通的垃圾，它里面总含有百分之三十到四十的棉花纤维。我从小也跟父母种过棉花，知道农民们种棉花是很辛苦的，现在呢，不少有用的棉花纤维却混在垃圾里变成废物了，这多可惜！要是能从垃圾中收回更多的棉花纤维，这不光对国家建设有好处，而且也能对得起农民兄弟。
    我就想在这上面找出增产节约的门路来。有一次，我参加了华东纺织管理局的保全工作会议，在这个会上学到很多先进经验。回到厂里以后，我细细研究机器，发现垃圾中含棉多少，同气流很有关系。我想加强气流，就在立式开棉机上装了一只马达，使风扇速度由原来一分钟一千二百转增加到一千四百六十转。这一来果然见效，垃圾中的棉花纤维减到不到百分之二十了。但速度太快，机器的轴承吃不消，而且一小时要用三度电，几部车子算下来，一年要用二万度到三万度电，这不是挖肉补疮、移东补西的做法吗？
    为了这，我很烦恼，但党和行政上都支持我，鼓励我继续试验。这一来，我的劲头更大了，我天天戴上老花眼镜学文化，还要翻技术书，找参考资料，前前后后想出了二十几个办法，同技术员李长飞一道试验了好些次都失败了。但我仍然没灰心。
    有一天，我想到一个办法，就是：拆去马达，在机器顶部的刀片盘上加装三片风翼，来增加气流；这些全是用废料做成的；也不另外费电。机器开动了一会，我们打开车肚抓出垃圾一看，哈，果然不同！垃圾由白变黑了，这就是说，垃圾中的棉花纤维减少了。以后，我和大家一起又做了一些改进，垃圾中的棉花纤维减少到百分之十左右。今年四月份，三号豪猪式开棉机垃圾中的棉花的纤维又减到百分之五左右，但这还做得很不够，还要继续努力。
    去年，在上级的领导和支持下，工人弟兄们和我一起作了十几件改进，华东纺织管理局并且派了工作组来帮助我总结经验，向兄弟厂推广。现在，在全厂职工的努力下，现在我们每件纱的用棉量已减少到三百八十多斤，去年节约的棉花，共有十多万斤。各兄弟厂运用了这经验，也减少了用棉量，有的已创造出更新的成绩，我们还要向他们学习。
    最近，我们厂里已开始羼用黄花了，这是由于去年部分地区棉田遭了水灾的缘故。黄花的弹性小，拉力差，含杂多，它势必会增加我们清花工作的困难，但我们有信心、有办法克服这些困难。我们已调整了某些机器，要争取在用棉量不增加的条件下，用黄花纺出好纱、织出好布来，保证产品的质量，供应人民的需要。
