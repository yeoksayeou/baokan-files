    Members of the Vietnamese Government Delegation Visit Women's Drawnwork Production Cooperative
    (Our Newspaper) News: On the morning of June 27th, Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Pham Ngoc Thach, members of the Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, visited Beihai Kindergarten in Beijing. Accompanying Chairman Ho Chi Minh on the visit to the kindergarten were Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luo Guibo, our ambassador to Vietnam, and Ke Hua, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
    In the silkworm altar surrounded by green trees, a group of lively children in colorful clothes at Beihai Kindergarten eagerly awaited the arrival of their beloved Chairman Ho Chi Minh.
    Suddenly, the children saw several cars driving towards them in the distance of the yard, facing the morning sun, along a shady road.
    "He's here, he's here, Uncle Ho is here!" the children shouted happily.
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh got out of the car. Guoqing, a four-and-a-half-year-old girl, and Xiaohuai, a four-and-a-half-year-old boy, each holding a large bouquet of flowers, happily ran up to him and affectionately shouted, "Hello, Uncle Ho!"
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh put his arms around them and affectionately kissed their little faces.
    Immediately, a large group of lively and adorable children ran forward and surrounded Chairman Ho. They shouted loudly, "Hello, Uncle Ho!" Some tightly held Uncle Ho's hand, some grabbed his arm, and others tugged at his clothes. The children followed him closely in a friendly manner.
    Ding Hua, the young deputy director of Beihai Kindergarten, welcomed Chairman Ho into a clean and tidy living room. Guoqing and Xiaohuai, the children who presented flowers to Chairman Ho, sat on Chairman Ho's lap, unwilling to leave.
    Chairman Ho inquired about the kindergarten's situation and visited the children's various activities.
    To the sound of crisp and pleasant piano music, Chairman Ho came to a spacious hall. Here, a female teacher was leading a group of six- to seven-year-old children from the senior class in a music lesson. When the children saw Chairman Ho, they happily performed two programs - the Bang-Bang whip dance and the tambourine dance.
    After the children finished performing, they all affectionately shouted, "Uncle Ho!" and crowded around Chairman Ho. Chairman Ho immediately distributed a large bag of candy he had brought with him to the children.
    Ding Hua accompanied Chairman Ho on a tour of the children's bedrooms and activity rooms. Wherever he went, Chairman Ho always affectionately picked up the children or put his arms around them and kissed them, and he was always surrounded by the children. In an activity room for the middle class, a boy named Xinmin took a small comic book called "Vietnam's Zoya" and handed it to Chairman Ho. Xinmin also told Chairman Ho that they liked the Vietnamese children in the book very much.
    Chairman Ho also visited the kindergarten's kitchen.
    In the last courtyard visited, a group of lively and adorable children pulled Chairman Ho to sit on the stone steps to take a picture together.
    Chairman Ho was about to leave Beihai Kindergarten, and the children reluctantly held his hands tightly, hugging him, unwilling to let him go. A group of older children politely ran in front of Chairman Ho and gave Uncle Ho many beautiful colored pictures they had drawn themselves. Chairman Ho kissed them and waved goodbye to them, and the children reluctantly waved their little hands to see off their beloved Uncle Ho.

    越南政府代表团团员参观妇女挑花生产合作社
    本报讯　六月二十七日的早晨，胡志明主席和越南民主共和国代表团团员范玉石访问了北京北海幼儿园。陪同胡志明主席到幼儿园访问的，有外交部副部长姬鹏飞，我国驻越南大使罗贵波，外交部礼宾司司长柯华。
    在绿树环绕的蚕坛里，北海幼儿园的一群穿着花衣服的活泼的孩子，热情地在等待着亲爱的胡志明主席的到来。
    忽然，孩子们望见了院子的远处，迎着朝阳，沿着一条有着绿荫的马路，驶过来几辆小汽车。
    “来了，来了，胡伯伯来啦！”孩子们高兴地喊起来。
    胡志明主席下了车。四岁半的女孩国庆和四岁半的男孩小槐，每人手里捧着一大束鲜花，快乐地跑到他面前，亲切地喊着：“胡伯伯好！”
    胡志明主席把他们揽在怀里，慈祥地亲吻着他们的小脸。
    随着，一大群活泼可爱的孩子都跑上前围住了胡主席。大声地喊着“胡伯伯，你好！”有的紧拉着胡伯伯的手，有的抓住他的臂膀，还有的扯住他的衣襟。孩子们亲热地紧跟着他。
    北海幼儿园年轻的副所长丁华，把胡主席迎进到一间整洁的客厅里。给胡主席献花的孩子国庆和小槐，坐在胡主席的怀里，一直不肯离开。
    胡主席关切地问着幼儿园的情况，他参观了孩子们的各种活动。
    迎着清脆悦耳的钢琴声，胡主席来到了一间宽敞的大厅里。这里，女教养员正领着一群六岁到七岁的大班孩子在上音乐课。孩子们看见胡主席来了，高兴地表演了两个节目——霸王鞭和铃鼓舞。
    孩子们表演完了，都亲热地喊着“胡伯伯！”拥到了胡主席的身边。胡主席立刻把随身带来的一大包糖分给孩子们。
    丁华陪引着胡主席参观了孩子们的卧室和活动室。每到一处，胡主席总是亲昵地把孩子抱起来或揽在怀里亲吻着他们，也总是被孩子们包围了起来。在一个中班的活动室里，一个叫做新民的男孩，拿着一本“越南的卓娅”的连环图画的小书，送到胡主席的手里，新民还告诉胡主席，他们很喜欢书里讲的越南的小朋友。
    胡主席还参观了幼儿园的厨房。
    在最后参观的一个院子里，一群活泼可爱的孩子，拉着胡主席一起坐在石阶上照了像。
    胡主席就要离开北海幼儿园了，孩子们恋恋不舍地紧紧握住他的双手，抱住他，不肯放他走。一群大孩子有礼貌地跑到胡主席的身前，把他们自己画的许多美丽的彩色图画送给了胡伯伯。胡主席亲吻着他们，和他们招手再见，孩子们都不舍地摇着小手送走了亲爱的胡伯伯。
