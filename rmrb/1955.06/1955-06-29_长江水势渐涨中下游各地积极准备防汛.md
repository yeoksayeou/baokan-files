The Yangtze River Water Level is Rising, Mid- and Lower Reaches Actively Prepare for Flood Control

    In the past ten days or so, most areas of the Yangtze River basin have experienced continuous rainfall, and the Yangtze River water level has gradually risen. Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, along the river and around the lakes, have begun flood control; Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces are intensifying their flood control preparations. On the Yangtze River's midstream water and land transportation lines, ships and trucks are continuously transporting grain, sacks, straw bags, and other materials needed during the flood season to various flood control sections of the dikes. The flood control telecommunications repair equipment work on important dike sections along the Yangtze River in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces is also being accelerated.
    Since the Yangtze River entered the flood season, the water situation in various places has been relatively stable. Since mid-June, rainfall has continued in the southern bank areas of the Yangtze River, and some areas of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have experienced heavy rain. The water level of the Yangtze River from Yibin, Sichuan Province, to Jiangyin, Jiangsu Province, has generally risen. At 8:00 AM on June 23, the Yangtze River water level at Wuhan Customs rose to 22.38 meters. The water levels of the Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake systems are mostly close to or exceeding the warning water level.
    Currently, more than 150,000 people in the lakeside counties of Hunan Province have gone to the flood control construction sites to reinforce dangerous works, repair sub-dikes, and dredge flood channels. In northern Jiangxi Province, the Xin River, Rao River, Xiu River, and Jin River all exceeded the highest historical flood levels around June 20. The people along the rivers fought for several days and nights and have overcome the first major flood this year. They are now repairing the dikes to defend against another flood attack. People in the areas along the river and around the lakes in Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces are stepping up the repair of dikes. Hubei Province has built sub-dikes on many important dike sections, repaired the dike slopes, and prepared a large amount of reserve soil for flood control. Anqing Prefecture in Anhui Province has mobilized more than 24,000 workers to go to the dikes, and Wuhu Prefecture has organized 50,000 workers. Hundreds of wooden boats shuttle back and forth along the river, transporting flood control materials, and the province has dispatched more than 30 people to various places to inspect flood control work.

    长江水势渐涨中下游各地积极准备防汛
    最近十来天内，长江流域大部地区连续阴雨，长江水位渐有涨势。湖南、江西两省沿江滨湖各县开始防汛；湖北、安徽和江苏等省防汛准备工作正在加紧进行。长江中游水陆交通线上，轮船、汽车正把防汛期间所需的粮食、麻袋、草包等器材、物料源源运往各个防汛堤段。长江下游安徽、江苏两省沿江重要堤段的防汛电讯检修装置工作，也正在加紧进行。
    长江进入汛期以来，各地水情比较平稳。六月中旬起，长江南岸地区接连降雨，湖南、江西两省有些地区形成暴雨。长江从四川省宜宾到江苏省江阴一线，水位普遍上涨。六月二十三日上午八时，武汉关长江水位上涨到二二点三八公尺。洞庭湖水系、鄱阳湖水系水位大都接近或超过警戒水位。
    现在，湖南省滨湖各县已有十五万多人走上防汛工地，进行险工加固，抢修子埝和洪道疏浚等工程。江西省北部信江、饶河、修水、锦江等，六月二十日左右都超过历年最高洪水位，沿河人民搏斗了好几昼夜，已战胜今年第一次大洪水。目前正在检修堤防，防御洪水再次袭击。湖北、安徽和江苏等省沿江滨湖地区人民，正在加紧检修堤防。湖北省在许多重要堤段上修筑了子埝，修补了堤埂，准备了大批的防汛预备土。安徽省安庆专区已动员民工二万四千多人上堤，芜湖专区已组织好五万民工。沿江各地数百只木船往来不停地运送防汛器材，省里并抽出三十多人到各地检查防汛工作。
