Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th (TASS dispatch): It has been previously reported that the Soviet government sent a note to the French government on May 26 regarding the issue of convening a four-power summit conference. Identical notes were also sent to the United States government and the British government.

On June 6, the Soviet government received replies from the governments of France, the United States, and Britain. The full text of the French government's note is as follows:

	"The French Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and has the honor to notify the following:

	The governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States draw attention to their note of May 10, 1955, to the Soviet government suggesting an early holding of a four-power summit conference. They recall that the foreign ministers of the four countries unanimously agreed during informal talks in Vienna on May 14 and 15 that holding such a conference was appropriate, and noted with satisfaction that this view was affirmed in the Soviet Foreign Ministry's note of May 26.

	Regarding the venue for holding the four-power summit conference, it may be recalled that in Vienna, the foreign ministers of the three governments suggested Lausanne, while the Soviet Foreign Minister suggested Vienna, and the Soviet government affirmed this suggestion in its note of May 26. In view of differing opinions regarding the venue for holding the conference, the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States now propose that the four-power summit conference be held in Geneva, a city with excellent facilities for holding such a significant conference.

	Therefore, the three governments propose that the four-power summit conference be held in Geneva from July 18 to 21 (including July 18 and 21).

	The three governments hope very much to receive a reply as soon as possible, so that consultations can be held with the Swiss government, which has informed the three governments that holding such a conference in Geneva on the above-mentioned dates is agreeable.

	Moscow, June 6, 1955."

The full text of the Soviet government's note sent to the French government on June 13 is as follows:

	"The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs presents its compliments to the French Embassy, and has the honor to notify the following in response to Your Embassy's note of June 6:

	In its note of May 26 to the French government, in reply to the French government's note of May 10, the Soviet government expressed a positive attitude towards convening a four-power summit conference of France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, believing that the purpose of the aforementioned conference is to ease international tensions and promote mutual trust in relations between countries.

	The Soviet government agrees that the four-power summit conference will open in Geneva on July 18. At the same time, the Soviet government cannot but point out that the French government's note of June 6 expresses concern about the conference lasting only three or four days, while at the same time evading the important issue of the tasks of the aforementioned conference, as raised by the Soviet government in its note of May 26. In the current situation, the goal of the four governments participating in the conference should first and foremost be to ensure the completion of the main task of the conference, namely, to ease international tensions.

	The Soviet government notes with satisfaction the following notification: The Swiss government has agreed to hold the aforementioned conference in Geneva.

	Identical notes have been sent simultaneously to the British government and the United States government.

	Moscow, June 13, 1955."

    苏联政府复照法英美三国政府
    同意七月间在日内瓦召开四国首脑会议
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科十三日电：前已报道，苏联政府在五月二十六日曾经把一份关于召开四国政府首脑会议问题的照会送交法国政府。内容相同的照会也已经送交美国政府和英国政府。
    六月六日，苏联政府收到了法国、美国和英国三国政府的复照。法国政府的照会全文如下：
      “法国大使馆谨向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部致意，并荣幸地作如下的通知：
    法国、联合王国和美国三国政府提请注意它们在一九五五年五月十日给苏联政府的关于建议早日举行四国政府首脑会议的照会。它们记得，四国外长在五月十四日和十五日在维也纳举行非正式会谈时曾经一致认为：举行这种会议是适宜的；并且满意地注意到，这个意见在苏联外交部五月二十六日的照会中得到了肯定。
    关于举行四国政府首脑会议的地点，可以重提一下：在维也纳时，三国政府外交部长曾经建议在洛桑举行会议，而苏联外交部长建议在维也纳举行，苏联政府在五月二十六日的照会中并且肯定了这个建议。鉴于对举行会议的地点有不同意见，法国、联合王国和美国三国政府现在建议四国政府首脑会议在日内瓦举行，这个城市具有供举行这种意义重大的会议之用的良好的物质设备。
    因此，三国政府建议四国政府首脑会议从七月十八日到二十一日（十八日和二十一日两天也包括在内）在日内瓦举行。
    三国政府十分高兴地希望能够尽早得到答复，以便可以同瑞士政府进行商量，瑞士政府已经通知三国政府，在上述日期在日内瓦举行这种会议是可以同意的。
    一九五五年六月六日，莫斯科。”
  苏联政府在六月十三日送交法国政府的照会全文如下：
    “苏联外交部谨向法国大使馆致意，并荣幸地就贵大使馆六月六日照会作如下的通知：
    苏联政府在五月二十六日致法国政府的答复法国政府五月十日照会的照会中，已经对召开法国、苏联、美国和英国四国政府首脑会议表示积极的态度，认为上述会议的目的是缓和国际紧张局势和促进国与国的关系中的相互信任。
    苏联政府同意四国政府首脑会议七月十八日在日内瓦开幕。同时，苏联政府不能不指出，法国政府六月六日的照会一方面对会议只举行三、四天这一点表示关心，但同时却回避苏联政府在五月二十六日的照会中所提出的关于上述会议的任务这一个重要问题。在当前的局势下，参加会议的四国政府的努力目标首先应当是保证完成会议的主要任务，即缓和国际紧张局势。
    苏联政府满意地注意到下列通知：瑞士政府已经同意在日内瓦举行上述会议。
    内容相同的照会已经同时送交英国政府和美国政府。
      一九五五年六月十三日，莫斯科。”
