Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 10th: Syrian Foreign Minister Azem announced in the Syrian Parliament on the 9th that Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia have reached agreement on the majority of the terms for a new Arab nations cooperation organization.

	Azem said that these terms include the establishment of a special committee responsible for drafting a common foreign policy. In economic terms, it has been decided to unify the market, and proposals have been put forward for the establishment of an economic planning committee and an Arab bank. In military terms, Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia will establish a unified command headquarters for the three countries' armies in Damascus, and there will be a joint Arab army funded by a joint fund.

	Azem said that the United States, Britain, and Turkey had put pressure on Syria to join the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty. He also read to the parliament a memorandum from the United States to Syria exerting pressure, which was given to Syrian Prime Minister Asali by the US Ambassador to Syria two days after the signing of the Turkish-Iraqi treaty. The memorandum stated that the United States "would be willing to consider" strengthening the defenses of countries joining the Turkish-Iraqi alliance; "the United States cannot distribute its products in large quantities to uncooperative countries in this region"; "the United States government foresees that it cannot at any time support" the Arab Collective Security Pact, "nor even support any other conventions and organizations (of Arab countries)."

	Azem said that despite the pressure exerted on Syria by the United States and other countries, Syria has refused to join the Turkish-Iraqi treaty.

    埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯三国
    已就新合作组织的绝大部分条款达成协议
    新华社十日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部长阿泽姆九日在叙利亚议会宣布，埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯已经就新阿拉伯国家合作组织的绝大部分条款达成了协议。
    阿泽姆说，这些条款包括成立一个负责起草共同外交政策的专门委员会。在经济方面，已经决定统一市场，并且提出了成立经济计划委员会和阿拉伯银行的建议。在军事方面，埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯将在大马士革成立三国军队的统一司令部，并且将有一支由联合基金资助的联合的阿拉伯陆军。
    阿泽姆说，美国、英国和土耳其曾对叙利亚施加压力，要它参加土耳其—伊拉克军事条约。他并且向议会宣读了美国对叙利亚施加压力的一个备忘录，这个备忘录是美国驻叙利亚大使在土伊条约签署后两天交给叙利亚总理阿萨利的。这个备忘录说：美国“将愿意考虑”加强加入土伊联盟的国家的防务；“美国不能把它的产品大量分配给这个地区内的不合作的国家”；“美国政府预见它在任何时候都不能支持”阿拉伯国家集体公约，“甚至也不能支持（阿拉伯国家的）任何其他公约和组织”。
    阿泽姆说，尽管美国等国对叙利亚施加了压力，叙利亚已经拒绝参加土耳其—伊拉克条约。
