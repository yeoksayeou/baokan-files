Jilin State-Owned Deer Farms Begin Accepting Calves and Cutting Antlers

It is currently the season for deer to give birth and for harvesting deer antlers. State-owned deer farms in Jilin Province are busily engaged in accepting deer calves and harvesting deer antlers. The six state-owned deer farms in Longtanshan, Dongfeng, Shuangyang and other places will have more than 1,000 deer giving birth this year, and more than 800 male deer producing antlers. The staff of the Dongfeng Deer Farm are diligently taking care of the deer herds around the clock, and only two out of the eighty-five deer calves that have already been born have died. The Shuangyang Deer Farm is also adopting advanced experience to raise the post-partum does separately in order to protect the deer herds.

Currently, the six state-owned deer farms have produced more than 380 deer calves, of which 2.1% are twins. Fourteen pairs of antlers have been harvested.

    吉林国营鹿场开始接羔割茸
    目前正是鹿产羔和收割鹿茸的季节。吉林省各地国营鹿场，正在紧忙地接鹿羔和收割鹿茸。龙潭山、东丰、双阳等地六个国营鹿场，今年将有一千多头鹿产羔，有八百多头公鹿产茸。东丰鹿场的职工们，时刻不离鹿舍，精心地看护着鹿群，在已生产出的八十五头鹿羔中，只有两头死亡。双阳鹿场并采用先进经验对分娩后的母鹿分别饲养，以保护鹿群。
    现在，六个国营鹿场已产三百八十多头鹿羔，其中双羔的占百分之二点一。收鹿茸十四付。
