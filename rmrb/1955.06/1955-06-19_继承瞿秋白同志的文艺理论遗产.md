    Inheriting Comrade Qu Qiubai's Literary and Art Theoretical Legacy
    Chen Yong

    I

    It is the twentieth anniversary of Comrade Qu Qiubai's martyrdom. As an outstanding revolutionary and literary theorist, Comrade Qu Qiubai left a brilliant page in the history of the Chinese revolution and thought.

    As a literary theorist, what is the most valuable part of Comrade Qu Qiubai's legacy?

    The most valuable part of Comrade Qu Qiubai's literary and art theoretical legacy lies in his significant work in disseminating Marxist literary theory in China; in his adherence to the viewpoint of the working class and the direction of the Party in the field of literature and art; and in resolutely and irreconcilably fighting against anti-Marxist literary and artistic thoughts at that time to defend Marxism. Comrade Qu Qiubai demonstrated his high degree of Party spirit and high degree of principled spirit with particular clarity throughout all his literary and artistic theoretical activities.

    The period when Comrade Qu Qiubai began to engage in revolutionary literary and artistic activities was the initial stage of the Chinese revolutionary literary and artistic movement. At that time, most revolutionary literary and artistic workers were very poorly prepared in terms of Marxist literary theory. Without Marxist literary theory, a revolutionary literary and artistic movement is unimaginable. Introducing Marxist literary theory to China was of particular importance to the revolutionary literary and artistic movement at that time. Comrade Qu Qiubai was one of those who earnestly translated and introduced the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Plekhanov, and other Marxist literary theorists to China. The work done by Comrade Qu Qiubai in this regard continues to play its role even today.

    Comrade Qu Qiubai tried to apply this theory to Chinese practice and to use this theory to guide the Chinese literary and artistic movement at that time. Comrade Qu Qiubai particularly keenly felt that the May Fourth Movement had not fundamentally solved the problem of combining literature and art with the masses, and particularly keenly felt the isolation of new literature and art from the broad masses of the people. Therefore, he believed that it was necessary to launch another "literary revolution." He once said the following about the serious shortcomings of Chinese new literature and art at that time: "In terms of language and writing, a semi-literary language (the false vernacular of the May Fourth style) was created; in terms of style, people were only pursuing bizarre modernism; in terms of subject matter, people were mostly circling in the 'minds' of intellectuals. The early proletarian literary movement also inherited these bourgeois legacies. Therefore, it was isolated from the broad masses for a long time" ("Europeanized Literature and Art"). Only by truly standing on the position of the working class and the broad masses of the people could one point out the serious problems existing in Chinese new literature and art from form to content as deeply and sharply as Comrade Qu Qiubai did.

    Comrade Qu Qiubai attached great importance to the work of popularizing language, and he made important contributions to the reform of the Chinese language. However, he saw that the problem of popularizing literature and art was not only a problem of expression, but also a problem of the relationship between writers and the masses. He believed that the reason why the popularization of literature and art had always been empty talk in the past was that the "revolutionary intellectuals—the petty bourgeoisie—within the literary ranks had not yet made up their minds to join the ranks of the working class. They still thought of themselves as teachers of the masses, and fundamentally refused to 'learn from the masses'" ("Who are 'We'?"). Comrade Qu Qiubai keenly realized that there was a tendency at that time to verbally support "popularization" but in reality, people were unwilling to put down the airs of intellectuals and always maintained an aristocratic attitude towards the masses. Comrade Qu Qiubai believed that this was a "deeper obstacle to popularization": "...we have discovered a deeper obstacle to popularization—that is, most revolutionary writers and 'literary youths' still stand outside the masses, attempting to stand above the masses to teach the masses" ("Who are 'We'?" The italics are the original author's). Comrade Qu Qiubai even said sharply: "The problem now is that revolutionary writers must learn from the masses. Do the current writers deserve to talk about asking the masses to look up to them? To be honest, they don't deserve it." This was a profound and genius insight at the time, and it was consistent with the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

    Comrade Qu Qiubai tirelessly promoted the idea that literature and art should serve politics in many articles. He even personally wrote many popular works that were easy to popularize and directly coordinated with the political struggles of the time.

    II

    Comrade Qu Qiubai's famous essay on Lu Xun is a brilliant example of the combination of Marxism and the specific practice of literary struggle in China. In this brilliant essay ("Preface to 'Selected Essays of Lu Xun'"), Comrade Qu Qiubai made a comprehensive and profound Marxist analysis and evaluation of Lu Xun for the first time in China, and powerfully attacked the past idealistic and mechanistic misconceptions of Lu Xun from all sides. The problem of understanding Lu Xun was directly related to the problem of understanding the direction of literary struggle in China. Only by truly understanding Marxism and also understanding the reality of the Chinese revolution and the direction of Chinese literary struggle could one reach an understanding of Lu Xun like that of Comrade Qu Qiubai.

    In his essay on Lu Xun, Comrade Qu Qiubai profoundly revealed the significance of Lu Xun's literary activities and determined Lu Xun's historical status in modern Chinese literature. What is very important is that Comrade Qu Qiubai scientifically analyzed the development process of Lu Xun's thought from evolutionism to class theory, from democracy to communism. The development from democracy to communism is the fundamental direction and fundamental law of the development of Lu Xun's thought and also of modern Chinese literature. Comrade Qu Qiubai's analysis of Lu Xun had great practical significance for the literary life of China at that time.

    As everyone knows, counter-revolutionary Hu Feng elements, such as Hu Feng himself and Geng Yong and his ilk, have always maliciously distorted the development process of Lu Xun's thought. Their secret task was not only to attempt to deny the decisive role of the Chinese Communist Party and Marxist ideology in the development of Lu Xun's thought, but also to attempt to deny the decisive role of the Chinese Communist Party and Marxist ideology in the development of the entire modern Chinese literature. Comrade Qu Qiubai's essay on Lu Xun is still a powerful weapon to destroy the counter-revolutionary thoughts of Hu Feng elements.

    Comrade Qu Qiubai's essay on Lu Xun shows that only the Marxist method, only the "most complete, profound, and non-one-sided" materialism dialectics as Lenin said, can truly understand complex literary phenomena. In the past, many people who stood on idealistic or mechanistic positions could not truly understand Lu Xun because idealism and mechanism are wrong, one-sided, and cannot correctly reflect objective things. Comrade Qu Qiubai's essay on Lu Xun still maintains its methodological significance in literary criticism.

    III

    It is very obvious that the path taken by the Chinese Marxist literary movement was not smooth. The hostile bourgeois literary thought would not only not automatically disarm, but also never stopped attacking Marxist literary thought, sometimes adopting a more concealed form and sometimes adopting a more open form. Between 1931 and 1932, when Marxist literary theory had already had a considerable influence in China, and the Marxist literary movement had already had considerable development, the enemies of Marxism rose up to oppose Marxist literary theory and the literary movement. This was the literary thought of the "free man" and the "third kind of person" of Hu Qiuyuan and Su Wen.

    In order to defend Marxism and for the forward development of the Chinese literary movement, communists had to fight against this hostile thought.

    Whenever the enemies of Marxism attack Marxist literary thought, they unanimously attack the principle of Party spirit in Marxist-Leninist literature and art, and attack the Marxist-Leninist worldview—the ideological foundation of socialist literature and art. The reason for this is very clear, because the principle of Party spirit in literature and art, the Marxist-Leninist worldview, accurately reflects the interests of the working class, and it is fundamentally opposed to the demands of all reactionary thoughts. Because of this, the problem of the relationship between the writer's worldview and creation, and the problem of the relationship between literature and art and politics, have always been very intense issues in the struggle between Marxism and various reactionary thoughts. We communists always demand to strengthen the guiding role of the Marxist-Leninist worldview in literature and art, and strengthen the connection between politics and literature and art; while the representatives of various reactionary thoughts are the opposite. They resolutely oppose the Marxist worldview and resolutely demand that literature and art be separated from revolutionary politics. Their usual "argument" is that the Marxist worldview, political nature, Party affiliation, tendency, etc., are incompatible with artistry, authenticity, etc. The former will only "hinder" or even "destroy" the latter. The "free man" represented by Hu Qiuyuan and the "third kind of person" represented by Su Wen are essentially the same. Hu Qiuyuan used the so-called "noble feelings" of literature and art to oppose the Marxist tendency, believing that "literature and art without noble feelings, and literature and art that are fundamentally hurt by the falsity of thought, have little value." He demanded "freedom" of literature and art, and put forward the slogan "Do not invade literature and art." Su Wen even made various slanders and distortions of Marxism-Leninism. He believed that Marxists-Leninists only wanted revolution and did not want truth or literature and art. He completely opposed revolution to truth, revolutionary political goals to artistic truth, and political correctness to artistic truth, believing that Marxists-Leninists only wanted to achieve revolutionary political goals and only wanted political correctness and abandoned artistic truth. Hu Qiuyuan and Su Wen's completely hostile thoughts to Marxism were strongly countered by Comrade Qu Qiubai and other Party and non-Party Marxists at that time.

    It is worth noting that both Hu Qiuyuan and Su Wen pretended to be the most loyal defenders of truth and literature and art, as if they still held an attitude of "sympathy" and "support" for the revolution, but advocated freedom and non-partisanship in art. This is why they called themselves "free men" and "third kind of person." Hu Qiuyuan even disguised himself as a Marxist, declaring that the "method he adopted was historical materialism." In his anti-Marxist articles, he cited a large number of remarks by classical Marxist writers, and even put up the banner of "Upholding Marxist Literary Theory" at the beginning of the article. If, more than twenty years ago, there had already been someone like Hu Qiuyuan in China who, although relatively clumsy, could be regarded as a disguised Marxist, then it is not surprising that the later counter-revolutionary Hu Feng elements more cleverly disguised themselves as "Marxists."

    Comrade Qu Qiubai particularly demonstrated his high degree of Party spirit, high degree of principled spirit, and political sharpness when opposing the enemies of Marxism, which is particularly worthy of our learning today. Comrade Qu Qiubai sharply and ruthlessly exposed its reactionary nature under the so-called non-partisanship or "Marxist" appearance of the enemy. Comrade Qu Qiubai not only used his clear theoretical analysis, but also used undeniable examples like Gorky and Serafimovich to prove that art and "agitation," writers and propagandists, can be completely unified.

    Lenin once said: "Marx believed that the value of his theory lies entirely in the fact that this theory 'is fundamentally critical and revolutionary.'" Comrade Qu Qiubai precisely understood and applied Marxism according to this Marxist point of view. Comrade Qu Qiubai, who had the characteristics of both a thinker and a revolutionary, particularly implemented the critical and revolutionary spirit of Marxism in his theoretical activities. Comrade Qu Qiubai was completely different from those dogmatic "theorists" and bookworms who were divorced from revolutionary practice.

    Comrade Qu Qiubai has been gone for twenty years. During this period, the Chinese revolution, for which Comrade Qu Qiubai devoted his life's enthusiasm and energy to fight for, has achieved great historical victories. Literature and art have begun to have a real combination with the broad masses. But the struggle has not stopped, and it is even more profound and complex than in the past. The task now facing our literary and art workers is to continue to conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, continue to implement the direction of literature and art put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, inherit Comrade Qu Qiubai's literary and artistic theoretical legacy, and carry out a resolute and irreconcilable struggle with all enemies of Marxist literary theory, so that our literary and artistic work can better serve the socialist revolution in China.

    继承瞿秋白同志的文艺理论遗产
    陈涌
    一
    瞿秋白同志就义二十周年了。作为一个杰出的革命家和文艺理论家，瞿秋白同志在中国革命史和思想史上留下了光辉的一页。
    作为一个文艺理论家，瞿秋白同志的遗产中的最可宝贵的部分是什么呢？
    瞿秋白同志的文艺理论遗产最可宝贵的部分就在于他对马克思主义文艺理论在中国的传播做了十分有意义的工作；在于他在文艺领域内坚持工人阶级的观点，坚持党的方向；在于保卫马克思主义，和当时反马克思主义的文艺思想进行坚决的不调和的斗争。瞿秋白同志在他全部文艺理论的活动中特别鲜明地表现出他的高度的党性，高度的原则精神。
    瞿秋白同志开始从事革命文艺活动的时期，正是中国革命文艺运动的初期，在那时候，大多数革命文艺工作者，对马克思主义文艺理论的准备都是十分薄弱的。而没有马克思主义的文艺理论，革命文艺运动是不可想像的。把马克思主义文艺理论介绍到中国来，对当时的革命文艺运动便有特别重要的意义。瞿秋白同志是认真地把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、普列哈诺夫等马克思主义的文艺理论的著作翻译和介绍到中国来的一个。瞿秋白同志在这方面所做的工作，直到今天还继续发挥它的作用。
    瞿秋白同志力图把这个理论应用到中国的实践，力图用这个理论来指导当时中国的文艺运动。瞿秋白同志特别痛切地感到五四运动并没有根本解决文艺和群众结合的问题，特别痛切地感到新文艺和广大人民的隔离，因而认为有再发动一次“文学革命”的必要。他曾经这样说过当时中国新文艺的严重的缺点：“在言语文字方面造成了一种半文言（五四式的假白话），在体裁方面尽在追求着怪僻的摩登主义，在题材方面大半只在智识分子的‘心灵’里兜圈子。初期的无产文学运动也承受了这些资产阶级的遗产。因此，它很久的和广大的群众隔离着”（“欧化文艺”）。只有真正站在工人阶级和广大人民的立场，才能够像瞿秋白同志这样深刻和尖锐地指出中国新文艺从形式到内容所存在着的严重的问题。
    瞿秋白同志十分重视语言的大众化的工作，他在中国语文改革工作方面有重要的贡献。但他看到，文艺大众化的问题首先还不仅是表现形式的问题，而是作家和群众关系的问题。他认为文艺大众化在过去所以始终是空谈，原因就在于文学队伍内的“革命的知识分子——小资产阶级，还没有决心走进工人阶级的队伍，还自己以为是大众的教师，而根本不肯‘向大众去学习’。”（“‘我们’是谁？”）瞿秋白同志十分敏锐地觉察到当时有一种口称拥护
  “大众化”，而实际上并不愿意放下知识分子的架子，对群众始终保持着贵族态度的倾向，瞿秋白同志认为这是“大众化的更深刻的障碍”：“……我们发现大众化的更深刻的障碍。——这就是革命的文学家和‘文学青年’大半还站在大众之外，企图站在大众之上去教训大众’（“‘我们’是谁？”旁点为原作者所加）。瞿秋白同志甚至这样尖锐地说：“现在的问题是：革命的作家要向群众去学习。现在的作家，难道配讲要群众去高攀他吗？老实说是不配。”这在当时是一种深刻的天才的见解，和毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的精神是一致的。
    瞿秋白同志在许多文章里都不倦地宣传文艺为政治服务的思想，他甚至自己亲自动手写过许多直接配合当时的政治斗争的便于普及的通俗的作品。二
    瞿秋白同志关于鲁迅的有名的论文是马克思主义同中国具体的文艺斗争实践结合的一个光辉的范例。瞿秋白同志在他的这篇辉煌的论文（“‘鲁迅杂感选集’序言”）里，在中国第一次对鲁迅作出了全面的深刻的马克思主义的分析和评价，有力地打击了过去来自各方面的对鲁迅的唯心论的和机械论的错误的认识。对鲁迅的认识的问题，直接牵涉到对于中国文学斗争方向的认识的问题。只有既真正认识马克思主义，同时又认识中国革命的实际和中国文学斗争的方向，才可能对鲁迅达到像瞿秋白同志那样的认识。
    瞿秋白同志在他的关于鲁迅的论文里深刻地揭示了鲁迅的文学活动的意义，确定了鲁迅在现代中国文学上的历史地位。十分重要的是，瞿秋白同志科学地分析了鲁迅的思想从进化论到阶级论，从民主主义到共产主义的发展过程。从民主主义到共产主义，是鲁迅思想发展同时也是现代中国文学发展的根本方向和根本规律。瞿秋白同志对鲁迅的分析对于当时中国的文学生活有着巨大的实践意义。
    大家知道，反革命的胡风分子，如胡风本人及耿庸之流，是一贯恶意地歪曲鲁迅思想发展的过程的，他们的秘密的任务，不但在于企图否认中国共产党和马克思主义思想对鲁迅思想发展的决定的作用，而且还在于企图否认中国共产党和马克思主义思想对整个现代中国文学发展的决定的作用。瞿秋白同志关于鲁迅的论文至今仍然是摧毁胡风分子这类反革命思想的有力的武器。
    瞿秋白同志关于鲁迅的论文表明，只有马克思主义的方法，只有如列宁所说的“最完整深刻而无片面性弊病”的唯物论的辩证法，才有可能真正地认识复杂的文艺的现象。过去许多站在唯心论或者机械论的立场的人所以不能够真正认识鲁迅，是因为唯心论和机械论是错误、片面而不能正确地反映客观事物的。瞿秋白同志关于鲁迅的论文至今还保持着它在文艺批评上的方法论的意义。三
    十分显然地，中国的马克思主义文艺运动所走过的路程并不是平静的，敌对的资产阶级的文艺思想不但不会自动解除武装，而且它从未停止过对马克思主义文艺思想的进攻，不过有时是采取比较隐蔽、有时是采取比较公开的形式。在一九三一年和一九三二年间，当马克思主义的文艺理论在中国已经发生了相当的影响，马克思主义的文艺运动已经有了相当的发展的时候，马克思主义的敌人便起来反对马克思主义的文艺理论和文艺运动，这就是胡秋原和苏汶的“自由人”和“第三种人”的文艺思想。
    为了保卫马克思主义，为了中国文艺运动的向前发展，共产主义者不能不同这种敌对的思想进行斗争。
    从来一切马克思主义的敌人攻击马克思主义的文艺思想的时候，都一致地攻击马克思列宁主义的文艺的党性的原则，攻击马克思列宁主义的世界观——社会主义文学艺术的思想基础。这理由是很明白的，因为正是文艺的党性的原则，马克思列宁主义的世界观，确切地反映了工人阶级的利益，它和一切反动思想的要求是根本对立的。也就因为这样，作家的世界观同创作的关系的问题，文艺同政治的关系的问题，从来就是马克思主义同各种反动思想斗争十分激烈的问题。我们共产主义者总是要求加强马克思、列宁主义的世界观对于文艺的指导作用，加强政治同文艺的联系；而各种反动思想代表者则相反，他们坚决地反对马克思主义的世界观，坚决地要求文艺离开革命的政治。他们通常的“论据”就是认为马克思主义的世界观、政治性、党派性、倾向性等等，是同艺术性、真实性等等不相容的。前者只会“妨碍”以至“破坏”后者。以胡秋原为代表的“自由人”和以苏汶为代表的“第三种人”在本质上也是这样的。胡秋原用文艺的所谓
  “高尚情思”同马克思主义的倾向性相对抗，认为“没有高尚情思的文艺，根本伤于思想之虚伪的文艺，是很少存在的价值的”。他要求文艺的“自由”，提出“勿侵略文艺”的口号。苏汶甚至对马克思列宁主义作了种种的污蔑和歪曲，他认为马克思列宁主义者只要革命，不要真理，不要文艺，他把革命同真理、革命的政治目的同艺术的真实，政治的正确性同艺术的真实性完全对立起来，认为马克思列宁主义者正是只要求达到革命的政治目的，只要求政治的正确而抛弃艺术的真实。胡秋原和苏汶这种完全敌视马克思主义的思想在当时便受到瞿秋白同志以及其他党的和非党的马克思主义者的有力的反击。
    值得注意的是，不论胡秋原和苏汶，都把自己装扮得仿佛是真理和文艺的最忠实的保卫者，仿佛他们对于革命也还是抱着“同情”和“赞助”的态度，只是在艺术上主张自由和无党派性，这就是为什么他们把自己称为“自由人”和“第三种人”。胡秋原甚至还把自己伪装为马克思主义者，宣称他采用的“方法是唯物史观”，在他的反马克思主义的文章里大量引证马克思主义的经典作家的言论，甚至在文章的前面也打着“马克思主义文艺理论之拥护”这样的旗子。如果在二十多年以前，在中国便已经有了虽然比较笨拙，但也算是伪装的马克思主义者像胡秋原这样的人出现，那么，后来的反革命的胡风分子更加巧妙地把自己装扮成“马克思主义者”，便没有什么可以奇怪的了。
    瞿秋白同志在反对马克思主义的敌人的时候特别表现出他的高度的党性，高度的原则精神和政治尖锐性，这正是今天特别值得我们学习的。瞿秋白同志在敌人的所谓无党派性或者“马克思主义”的外表下，锐利地无情地揭穿了它的反动的性质。瞿秋白同志不仅用他的明确的理论分析，而且用了像高尔基和绥拉菲摩维支这样的无可辩驳的例子，来证明艺术和“煽动”，文学家和宣传家，是完全可以统一的。
    列宁曾经说过：“马克思认为他的理论底价值全在于这个理论‘根本上就是批判的和革命的理论’”。瞿秋白同志正是按照这种马克思主义的观点来认识和应用马克思主义的。兼有着思想家和革命家的特点的瞿秋白同志，在他的理论活动中特别贯彻了马克思主义的批判的和革命的精神。瞿秋白同志和那些脱离革命实践的教条主义的“理论家”、书呆子是完全不同的。
    瞿秋白同志离开我们已经二十年了。在这期间，瞿秋白同志曾竭尽他毕生的热情和精力为之而奋斗的中国革命已经取得了伟大的历史性的胜利。文艺同广大群众开始有了真正的结合。但斗争并没有停止，而且比过去是更深刻和更复杂了。现在摆在我们文艺工作者面前的任务便是继续认真地学习马克思列宁主义，继续贯彻毛泽东同志提出的文艺方向，继承瞿秋白同志的文艺理论遗产，和一切马克思主义的文艺理论的敌人进行坚决不调和的斗争，使我们的文艺工作更好地为中国的社会主义革命服务。
