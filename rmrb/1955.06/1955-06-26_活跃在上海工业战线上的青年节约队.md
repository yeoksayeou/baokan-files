Youth Thrift Teams Active on Shanghai's Industrial Front
　　By our reporter Xi Ping
　　On Shanghai's industrial front, youth thrift teams have become a mass organization. In factory workshops, in warehouses, and on construction sites, one can see youth thrift team members working diligently. In August of last year, the Youth League members of the hull workshop of the Shanghai Ship Repair and Manufacturing Plant formed Shanghai's first youth thrift team. Ten months later, the number of youth thrift teams in Shanghai has grown to 430, with more than 13,000 young workers participating.
　　Youth thrift teams have brought a vibrant atmosphere to the thrift work in Shanghai's factories. Youth thrift team members use their spare time to carefully collect useful materials everywhere. They rummage through garbage dumps and scrap heaps that no one has ever rummaged through, sort out useful materials, and put them back into production. Last year, the bare wire workshop of the Shanghai Wire Factory lost 80 tons of copper. Some of these copper materials were mixed into the soil, some were washed away by water, and some were thrown away with the coal cinder. Now, the youth thrift team members are turning over the soil, digging open the ditches, and collecting every bit of copper material. In this way, they recovered a total of 9 tons and 800+ jin of copper, and also recovered 1 ton and 963 kilograms of aluminum. During a scrap collection activity, the youth thrift team of the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory mobilized more than 1,000 people and collected more than 100 tons of scrap iron and steel. Young workers at the state-owned Shanghai Bicycle Factory found materials in scrap piles that could be used to make more than 2,000 pedal shafts. The state-owned Shanghai Electricity Meter Factory collected valuable coils worth tens of thousands of yuan in one hour on June 5. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League's First Heavy Industry, Second Heavy Industry, Textile Industry, Light Industry, Transportation Industry, Electric Power Industry, and Construction Industry, the youth have collected more than 1,575 tons of scrap iron and steel and more than 60 tons of mixed copper for the country.
　　The work of the youth thrift teams has powerfully promoted the anti-waste struggle in Shanghai's factories. Many factory leaders have improved their enterprise management based on the waste revealed by the youth thrift teams. After the youth thrift team of the joint state-private operated Zhonghua Shipbuilding Factory revealed serious waste in the factory, the factory's Party committee immediately convened a meeting to discuss specific steps and methods for practicing thrift, and organized cadres at the workshop level and above to study. The thrift work of the entire factory was then fully launched. The Shanghai Bicycle Factory collected the waste materials collected by the youth thrift team and held an exhibition, using physical objects, pictures, charts, etc., to explain to all workers the harm that waste brings to the country and the people, and called on everyone to fight against waste. The Party, administrative, and trade union organizations of many factories have commended the advanced figures in the youth thrift teams and have paid attention to the research and guidance of the work of the youth thrift teams.
　　The activities of the youth thrift teams have also trained the young workers and strengthened their concept of cherishing state property. Young workers in the calendering section of the bare wire workshop of the Shanghai Wire Factory did not pay much attention to saving copper materials in the past. After participating in the thrift activity this time, they realized that this waste was inseparable from their usual lack of attention to saving. Now, the phenomenon of discarding copper materials is significantly reduced. Wang Youlong, a young worker at the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard, realized in this activity that saving should not only focus on the big picture, but also start with small things. In the past two months, he has gradually developed the habit of saving. He always pays attention to picking up discarded welding rod ends to use when welding, and in two months, he has saved a lot of welding rods for the country. Yan Genxiang, a young worker at the Jiangnan Shipyard, used to burn out a lot of rivets every day. After joining the youth thrift team, he saw many comrades picking up rivets one by one from the mud and felt very ashamed. Now he has tried to improve his operating methods, and the defect rate has been significantly reduced.

    活跃在上海工业战线上的青年节约队
    本报记者　习平
    在上海市的工业战线上，青年节约队已经成为一种群众性的组织了。人们在工厂的车间里，在仓库里，在建筑工地上，到处都可以看到青年节约队队员们紧张劳动的情景。在去年八月，上海市船舶修造厂船体车间的青年团员组成了上海市的第一支青年节约队，到十个月后的今天，上海市的青年节约队已发展到四百三十个，参加节约队的青年工人已达一万三千多人。
    青年节约队给上海各工厂的节约工作，带来了生气勃勃的气象。青年节约队队员们利用业余的时间，到处细心地搜集有用的器材，他们翻遍了那些从未有人翻过的垃圾堆和废料堆，将有用的材料清理出来，让它再投入生产。上海电线厂裸线车间去年一年损耗了八十吨铜，这些铜料有的混杂到泥土里去了，有的被水冲走了，还有的和煤渣一起丢掉了。现在，青年节约队队员们重新把泥土翻过来，把水沟挖开来，把一点一滴的铜料收起来。就这样，他们共回收了九吨零八百多斤铜，还回收了一吨零九百六十三公斤铝。国营上海锅炉厂的青年节约队在一次搜集废料的活动中，动员了一千多人，搜集了一百多吨废钢铁。国营上海自行车厂青年工人在废料堆中找出可以做两千多根踏脚梗的材料。国营上海电表厂在六月五日一小时内所收集到的贵重线圈价值好几万元。据青年团上海市第一重工业、第二重工业、纺织业、轻工业、交通运输业、电业、建筑业等八个产业团委的统计，青年们已经为国家搜集到废钢铁一千五百七十五吨多，杂铜六十多吨。
    青年节约队的工作有力地推动了上海各工厂的反浪费斗争，许多工厂的领导工作人员，针对青年节约队揭发的浪费现象，来改进企业管理工作。公私合营中华造船厂的青年节约队揭发了厂里严重的浪费现象之后，工厂党委会立即召开了会议，讨论了厉行节约的具体步骤和方法，并且组织了工段长以上干部进行学习，全厂的节约工作就全面开展起来了。上海自行车厂将青年节约队收集到的废旧料，集中起来举办了一个展览会，通过实物、图片、图表等，向全体工人说明浪费给国家和人民带来的危害，号召大家起来同浪费现象作斗争。许多厂的党、行政和工会组织表扬了青年节约队中的先进人物，并且注意了对青年节约队的工作的研究和指导。
    青年节约队的活动也锻炼了青年工人们，加强了他们爱护国家财产的观念。上海电线厂裸线车间压延工段的青年工人，过去不大注意节约铜料，这次参加了节约活动以后，认识到这种浪费是同自己平时不注意节约分不开的，现在乱扔铜料的现象显著减少了。上海求新造船厂青年工人王友龙，在这次活动中认识到节约不仅要从大处着眼，也要从小处着手的道理，二个月来逐渐养成了节约的习惯。他在电焊时随时注意捡拾别人丢弃的电焊条头来用，二个月中，就为国家节约了很多电焊条。江南造船厂青年工人严根祥过去每天经常要烧坏很多铆钉，参加青年节约队后，他亲眼看到许多同志从泥里把铆钉一棵一棵地拾起来，感到十分惭愧，现在他设法改进了操作方法，废品率就显著地降低了。
