The Great Victory of the Vietnamese National Liberation War
	Lin Nan
“A nation that has dared to resist the slave rule of the French for more than eighty years, a nation that has dared to stand on the side of the Allies to jointly resist fascism for several years, this nation must achieve freedom, this nation
  must gain independence!… We solemnly declare to the world: Vietnam should have the right to freedom and independence, and in fact we have become a free and independent country.”
	This is the Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, read by the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Ho Chi Minh, in the name of the Provisional Government of Vietnam at a mass rally attended by 500,000 people in Hanoi on September 2, 1945. This immortal declaration announced to the world that the Vietnamese people had stood up.
	Ten years have passed since then. Over the past ten years, the Vietnamese people have defended their independence and further developed the victory of the people's revolution. Today, the national rights of the Vietnamese people have been universally recognized. The glorious Democratic Republic of Vietnam, united with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, is fighting side by side for world peace and human progress.
	The Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence has followed a long and tortuous path. Since French colonialists set foot on Vietnamese soil more than ninety years ago, the Vietnamese people have never ceased their struggle against colonial rule.
	By 1930, with the establishment of the Indochinese Communist Party, the Vietnamese people's liberation movement entered a new stage. Although the Soviets established in Yi'an between China and Vietnam in 1930, as well as the heroic uprisings in Beishan, Dulong and other places in 1940 and 1941, were all brutally suppressed by the French colonialists, the anti-French struggle became even more intense. In May 1941, the Indochinese Communist Party organized the Vietnam Independence League, uniting patriotic forces across the country to launch a struggle against the French colonialists and the Japanese imperialists who had invaded Vietnam at that time, organizing armed forces to conduct guerrilla warfare. In August 1945, after Japan surrendered, the Indochinese Communist Party led the nation in a general uprising, announcing the end of imperialist rule in Vietnam.
	The French imperialists were not reconciled to withdrawing from this colony that they had occupied for nearly a century. They re-climbed the coast of Vietnam on British warships and occupied Saigon on September 23, 1945. Under the resistance of the Vietnamese people, they were forced to negotiate with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, signing a preliminary agreement and a temporary agreement on March 6 and September 14, 1946, respectively. However, they were not sincere in seeking a peaceful solution. On December 19, 1946, after completing all preparations, the French army in Hanoi suddenly launched a general offensive in Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which began the shameful and perfidious full-scale war of aggression by France against Vietnam.
	The French colonialists were confident that, relying on their well-equipped colonial army, they could reconquer Vietnam within three months. However, the Vietnamese people launched a very extensive guerrilla war and established anti-Japanese base areas in the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam. In order to eliminate the main force of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French colonialists concentrated 15,000 troops in October 1947 to launch a large-scale invasion of the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam. The battle lasted more than two months. Under the widespread counterattack of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French army lost 7,500 men and finally retreated in embarrassment. Its conspiracy of "quick battle and quick decision" was completely shattered.
	The Vietnamese People's Army, which was tempered in combat and continued to grow, began to launch a counter-offensive against the French army on the main battlefield in northern Vietnam from the winter of 1950. That winter, the Vietnamese People's Army launched a fierce offensive against the French army's strongholds along the Sino-Vietnamese border, eliminating the French defensive system threatening the northern part of the northern Vietnam liberated area, and liberating the three provinces of Cao Bang, Lang Son, and Lao Cai. At the same time, it also liberated the two provinces of Taiyuan and Hoa Binh in the south of the mountainous area of northern Vietnam.
	In the winter of 1951 and the spring of 1952, the Vietnamese People's Army again carried out encirclement and annihilation battles against the invading French army in Hoa Binh, west of the Red River Delta, annihilating more than 20,000 French troops. French Marshal Tassigny, who was tasked with "improving the situation in Vietnam," suffered heavy losses and was defeated. After the victory of the Hoa Binh campaign, a part of the main force of the Vietnamese People's Army moved from the west into the rich Red River Delta, strengthening the raging guerrilla warfare there, and threatening the French aggressors' invasion base from within.
	On other battlefields in Vietnam, the French army was also in a helpless situation. The French army only controlled large cities and some important transportation lines. The vast rural areas were in the hands of the Vietnamese People's Army. The illusion of "victory" also began to disappear in the reactionary newspapers of the French bourgeoisie. An article published in the Paris "Le Monde" in March 1952 admitted that the Indochina War "is consuming France's best troops," "French blood is being drained," and the strength of the French army "is declining."
	In the winter of 1952, the Vietnamese People's Army marched into the northwestern region of Vietnam, liberating most of Son La Province and Lai Chau Province. The French army's defensive system along the Black River was completely destroyed.
	The French colonialists, who had suffered successive defeats, attempted to regain the initiative in the war with the assistance of the United States. In May 1953, the French government sent Navarre to Vietnam to replace Salan, the French army commander-in-chief who had repeatedly suffered defeats. Based on the intentions of the United States, Navarre formulated a so-called "Navarre Military Plan." However, Navarre's fate was no better than his predecessors, and he lost 44,000 men in the six months after he took office.
	In November 1953, Navarre airdropped troops to Dien Bien Phu in northwestern Vietnam, attempting to threaten the Vietnamese People's Army from the flank and support the French army besieged in Lai Chau. But the result he got was not "initiative," but the dispersion of troops.
	The most disastrous blow suffered by the French invading army was at Dien Bien Phu. There, the French army concentrated one-fifth of its mobile forces—thirteen battalions—and built a dense network of solid fortifications and fortifications, supported by a large number of American aircraft and artillery. About 130 American transport planes a day airlifted three to four hundred tons of weapons and military supplies. But this solid fortress group was finally captured by the powerful Vietnamese People's Army on May 7, 1954 (on the eve of the Geneva Conference discussing the Indochina issue). The entire French elite force of twenty-two battalions was wiped out, and the garrison commander de Castries was captured alive.
	The brilliant victory of Dien Bien Phu completely shattered the
  "Navarre Military Plan" of the US and French aggressors, making the French invading army unable to recover. It proved the strength of the Vietnamese People's Army and pointed out the future of the war. This played a significant role in promoting the reaching of a ceasefire agreement on Indochina in Geneva.
	In the eight years of war, the French colonialists not only failed to realize their dream of reconquering Vietnam, but on the contrary, more than half of France's professional soldiers and more than a quarter of its officers were trapped in this battlefield 14,000 kilometers away from France. A total of 466,172 French and puppet troops were annihilated in the land and jungles of Vietnam.
	This "dirty war" seriously depleted France's national strength. In eight years, France invested more than 3 trillion francs in this war. In the last year of the war, the total military expenditure was 700 billion to 800 billion francs, averaging 2 billion francs per day. In the case of repeated military defeats, France had replaced the commander of the French Expeditionary Force in Indochina eight times. But neither the first commander, Leclerc, nor the last, Ély, neither Marshal Tassigny nor General Navarre, was able to create a miracle to save the defeat.
	Not only were the French colonialists utterly defeated, but the eight-year history of the Vietnamese people's resistance war also recorded the failure of American intervention. For a long time, the United States had coveted the economic resources of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and attempted to replace France's position in Indochina. On the military maps of the Pentagon in Washington, Vietnam had long been designated as a link in the US encirclement of the peaceful and democratic camp and a military base for preparing a war of aggression against China. From the beginning of 1950, the United States intensified its activities in Indochina. In June of that year, US President Truman, while ordering the US Navy and Air Force to directly participate in the war of aggression against Korea and ordering the US Navy to occupy Taiwan, also announced the intensification of intervention in the Indochina War. After that, the US intervention became more and more intense. The United States gave France more than 2.9 billion US dollars to support this colonial war. In the last year of the war, the United States had borne more than 70% of the war expenses in Indochina. The United States provided the French colonial army with more than 400,000 tons of various weapons, ammunition, and materials.
	The Vietnamese people's liberation struggle has written a glorious chapter in the history of the liberation movement of the people of colonial dependencies. This victorious struggle, together with the struggles of the people of other colonial dependencies, is promoting the collapse and disintegration of the imperialist colonial system and shaking the foundations of the capitalist system.
	In July 1954, the participating countries of the Geneva Conference reached an agreement to restore peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The national rights for which the Vietnamese people had fought for more than eighty years were universally recognized, and peace was restored.
	The Vietnamese people are now continuing the struggle to consolidate peace, achieve reunification, and complete national independence and democracy. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has already issued a statement on June 6, expressing its readiness to hold consultation meetings with the representative and responsible authorities of South Vietnam from July 20, 1955, to discuss the issue of holding free general elections throughout Vietnam in July 1956. It cannot be ignored that on the road of the Vietnamese people's struggle, there are still obstructions and sabotage from the United States, and there will be arduous struggles ahead. However, justice is on the side of the Vietnamese people, the sympathy of the whole world is with the Vietnamese people, and under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, which has been tested in long-term struggles and armed with Marxism-Leninism, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve the final victory in the cause of consolidating peace, achieving reunification, and completing independence and democracy.

    越南民族解放战争的伟大胜利
    林南
      “一个八十多年来敢于反抗法国人的奴隶统治的民族，一个数年来敢于站在盟国一边共同反抗法西斯的民族，这个民族一定要取得自由，这个民族
  一定要获得独立！……我们郑重地向全世界宣布：越南应该有权得到自由和独立，而且事实上我们已经成了一个自由和独立的国家。”
    这是越南人民伟大的领袖胡志明在一九四五年九月二日以越南临时政府的名义，在河内有五十万人参加的群众大会上宣读的越南民主共和国独立宣言。这个不朽的宣言向世界宣布越南人民已经站立起来了。
    从那时起，已经十个年头过去了。十年来，越南人民保卫了自己的独立，进一步发展了人民革命的胜利。今天，越南人民的民族权利已经得到了普遍的承认，光荣的越南民主共和国同苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家团结在一起，为世界和平和人类进步共同奋斗，并肩前进。
    越南人民争取民族独立的斗争是走过漫长和曲折的道路的。从九十多年前法国殖民者踏上越南的土地以后，越南人民就没有间断过反对殖民统治的斗争。
    到一九三○年，印度支那共产党成立，越南人民的解放运动更走上一个新的阶段。一九三○年在中越宜安建立的苏维埃以及后来在一九四○年和一九四一年在北山、都梁等地的英勇起义，虽然都遭到了法国殖民者的残酷镇压，然而反法斗争却更加激烈起来。一九四一年五月，印度支那共产党组织了越南独立同盟，团结全国爱国力量，展开反对法国殖民者和当时已侵入越南的日本帝国主义的斗争，并组织武装，进行游击战。一九四五年八月日本投降，印度支那共产党领导全国进行总起义，宣告了帝国主义的统治在越南的结束。
    法帝国主义者并不甘心于退出这个被他们侵占近一世纪的殖民地。他们乘着英国军舰重又爬上了越南的海岸，在一九四五年九月二十三日侵占了西贡。在越南人民的抗击下，他们被迫和越南民主共和国谈判，先后在一九四六年三月六日和九月十四日签订了初步协定和临时协定，但是，他们并没有诚意谋求和平解决。一九四六年十二月十九日，河内法军于完成全部准备工作后，就突然在越南民主共和国首都河内发动总攻击，这就开始了法国对越南进行的可耻和背信的全面侵略战争。
    法国殖民者满以为依靠他们的装备精良的殖民军队就可以在三个月内重新征服越南。但是，越南人民展开规模非常广泛的游击战，并在越北山区建立了抗战的根据地。为了消灭越南人民军的主力，法国殖民者在一九四七年十月集中了一万五千兵力，大举进犯越北山区。战斗持续了两个多月。法军在越南人民军的广泛反击下，损失了七千五百人，终于狼狈地退走了。它的“速战速决”的阴谋被彻底粉碎。
    在战斗中得到锻炼和不断壮大的越南人民军，从一九五○年冬天起就开始在北越的主要战场上向法军发动反攻。这年冬天，越南人民军沿中、越边界向法军的据点展开猛烈攻势，扫除了威胁越北解放区北部的法军防御体系，解放了高平、谅山、老街三个省；同时在越北山区的南面又解放了太原、和平两省。
    在一九五一年冬天和一九五二年春天，越南人民军又在红河三角洲西部的和平对进犯的法军进行围歼战，歼灭法军两万多人。负有“改善越南局势”任务的法国元帅塔西尼损兵折将，遭到了失败。和平战役胜利后，越南人民军一部分主力从西面开进富饶的红河三角洲，加强当地如火如荼的游击战争，从里面威胁法国侵略者的侵略基地。
    在越南的其他战场上，法军也陷于一筹莫展的境地。法军只控制着大城市和一些重要的交通线。广大的农村是在越南人民军手里。“胜利”的幻想也开始在法国资产阶级的反动报纸上消失。一九五二年三月间巴黎“世界报”刊登的文章就承认，印度支那战争“正消耗着法国最优良的部队”，“法国血液正在枯竭”，法军的力量“正在往下坡走”。
      一九五二年冬季，越南人民军向越南西北部地区进军，解放了山萝省和莱州省的大部分地区。法军沿黑水江的防御体系全部被摧毁。
    接连遭到失败的法国殖民者企图在美国的援助下夺回战争的主动权。一九五三年五月，法国政府派纳瓦尔到越南接替屡吃败仗的法军总司令萨兰。纳瓦尔根据美国的意图，拟订出一个所谓“纳瓦尔军事计划”。但是，纳瓦尔的命运并不比他的前任好一些，在他上任后的半年中，就损失了四万四千人。
    一九五三年十一月间，纳瓦尔把军队空投到越南西北部的奠边府，企图从侧翼来威胁越南人民军和支援莱州被围困的法军。但是他得到的结果不是“主动”，而是部队分散。
    法国侵略军遭受到的最惨重的打击是在奠边府。在那里，法军集中有它五分之一的机动兵力——十三个营，构筑有密密麻麻的坚固堡垒和工事，有大量的美国飞机和大炮的支援。每天约有一百三十架美国运输机给它空运三、四百吨武器和军事供应品。但是这个坚固的堡垒集团终于在一九五四年五月七日（日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题前夕）被强大的越南人民军攻下来了。法军精锐二十二个营全军覆没，守军司令德卡斯特莱被生俘。
    奠边府的辉煌胜利彻底粉碎了美、法侵略者的
  “纳瓦尔军事计划”，使法国侵略军一蹶不振。它证明了越南人民军力量的强大，指出了战争发展的前途。这对于在日内瓦达成印度支那停战协议起了重大的促进作用。
    在八年的战争中，法国殖民者不仅没有能实现它重新征服越南的梦想，相反地，倒使法国的一半以上的职业士兵和四分之一以上的军官陷入了这个远离法国一万四千公里的战场。法军和伪军共四十六万六千一百七十二人在越南的土地和丛林中被歼灭了。
    这个“肮脏战争”使法国的国力受到了严重的消耗。八年中，法国投入这个战争的军费超过了三万亿法郎。在战争的最后一年，军费总额是七千亿法郎到八千亿法郎，平均每天要消耗二十亿法郎。在军事上连连失败的情况下，法国曾经八次更换印度支那法国远征军的统帅。但是无论是第一任的勒克莱克或者是最后一任的埃利，不论是塔西尼元帅还是纳瓦尔将军，都没有能创造出挽救败局的奇迹。
    不仅是法国殖民者一败涂地，越南人民的八年抗战的历史也记录着美国干涉的失败。长久以来，美国就觊觎着越南和老挝、柬埔寨的经济资源，企图取代法国在印度支那的地位。在华盛顿五角大楼的军事地图上，越南早已被划为美国对和平民主阵营的包围圈上的一个环节和准备对中国发动侵略战争的一个军事基地。从一九五○年初起，美国就加紧了它在印度支那的活动。这年六月，美国总统杜鲁门在命令美国海、空军直接参加侵略朝鲜的战争并且命令美国海军侵占台湾的同时，还宣布加紧干涉印度支那战争。在这以后，美国的干涉是一步紧似一步。美国给了法国二十九亿以上的美元来支持这个殖民战争。在战争的最后一年，美国已经负担了印度支那战费的百分之七十以上。美国给法国殖民军的各种武器、军火和物资在四十万吨以上。
    越南人民的解放斗争已经在殖民地附属国人民解放运动史上写下了光荣的篇页。这个胜利的斗争同其他殖民地附属国人民的斗争一起促使着帝国主义殖民体系的崩溃瓦解，动摇着资本主义体系的基础。
    一九五四年七月，日内瓦会议各与会国达成协议，在尊重越南、柬埔寨和老挝的独立、统一和领土完整的基础上恢复印度支那的和平。越南人民前仆后继为之奋斗八十多年的民族权利得到了普遍的承认，和平恢复了。
    越南人民现在正继续进行着巩固和平、实现统一、完成全国独立和民主的斗争。越南民主共和国政府已经在六月六日发表声明，表示准备从一九五五年七月二十日起同南越有代表性的负责当局举行协商会议，讨论在一九五六年七月在越南全国举行自由普选的问题。不能不看到，在越南人民斗争的道路上，还有着来自美国方面的阻挠和破坏，前面还有着艰苦的斗争，但是，正义在越南人民一边，全世界的同情在越南人民，越南人民在久经斗争考验的、为马克思列宁主义武装起来的越南劳动党的领导之下，是一定能取得巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主事业的最后胜利。
