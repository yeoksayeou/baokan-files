A West Liao River Survey Team, composed of units such as the Shenyang Branch of the Beijing Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources, is currently conducting comprehensive survey work in an area of approximately 150,000 square kilometers in the upper reaches of the Liao River. The survey area includes the Jirem League and Ju-Uda League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as parts of Rehe, Liaoning, and Jilin provinces, covering a region with approximately 3 million people in a total of twenty-three counties and banners. In addition to the Shenyang Branch of the Beijing Survey and Design Institute, participating units include the Land Utilization Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, the Department of Forestry, and the Bureau of Water Resources of Inner Mongolia, the Department of Forestry and the Bureau of Water Resources of Rehe Province, and the Bureau of Water Resources of the Jirem League. A total of more than 50 professionals in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, soil, geology, and water conservancy have been dispatched. Since mid-March of this year, they have started surveying reservoirs, flood detention areas, river channels, livestock drinking water, grassland irrigation, and paddy and dry land irrigation downstream from Chifeng in Rehe Province. They are also conducting desert research and controlled route surveys of soil and geology. They will propose a flood control and irrigation measure plan for the sloping water area in 1956, and continue to conduct large-scale comprehensive survey work in mountainous and swampy areas.

Rainfall is scarce in this area, the climate is arid, and disasters such as waterlogging, drought, wind, and hail occur frequently. The Mongolian and other fraternal ethnic groups who live here engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry are constantly subjected to disaster, which seriously affects their production and lives. To this end, the state has decided to combine the construction of the Northeast Shelterbelt with the overall water conservancy and rational utilization of land resources in the river basin planning work.

    辽河上游进行综合性勘查工作
    水利部北京勘测设计院沈阳分院等单位组成的西辽河勘查队，现正在辽河上游约十五万平方公里范围内进行综合性的勘查工作，勘查范围包括内蒙古自治区的哲里木盟、昭乌达盟及热河、辽宁、吉林等省部分地区，共二十三个县旗，约三百万左右人口的地区。参加勘查工作的除北京勘测设计院沈阳分院外，还有农业部土地利用总局，内蒙古农牧部、林业部、水利局，热河省林业局、水利局和哲里木盟水利局等单位，共抽调农、林、牧、土壤和地质、水利等专业人员五十余人，自今年三月中旬，从热河省赤峰向下游开始勘查水库、滞洪区、河道及牲畜饮水、草原灌溉、水旱田灌溉、并进行沙漠研究和土壤、地质等控制性路线勘查工作。他们将在一九五六年提出勘查坡水区的防洪灌溉措施方案，并继续进行山区和沼泽区的大型综合勘查工作。
    这个地区内降雨量稀少，气候干旱，水、旱、风、雹等灾害频繁，聚居在这里过着农牧生活的蒙古族等兄弟民族，不断受着灾害侵袭，严重地影响生产和生活。为此，国家确定结合东北防护林带的营造，进行全面水利和土地资源合理利用的流域规划工作。
