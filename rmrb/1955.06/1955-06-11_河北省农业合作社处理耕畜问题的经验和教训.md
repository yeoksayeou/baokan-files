The handling of draft animals by agricultural production cooperatives is an extremely important policy issue in the agricultural collectivization movement, as draft animals are currently the most important means of production besides land. Whether the handling methods are properly prescribed is directly related to the unity of poor and middle peasant members and the consolidation of the cooperative, directly affecting the protection and breeding of draft animals, impacting the production of agricultural production cooperatives, and even affecting the production morale of the broad masses of peasants outside the cooperative.

The various handling methods adopted by agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province for the draft animals of their members and the results of implementing these methods provide important experiences and lessons for solving this problem.

Among the more than 100,000 agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province, more than 80% of them adopted the method of converting the value of draft animals into shares, collective ownership, and centralized feeding. The remaining nearly 20% of the cooperatives adopted the method of private ownership and public use of draft animals. For the privately owned draft animals that were used in a unified manner, some were rented with rent paid, some were calculated as "work" points for dividends, and some were paid interest on the converted price; some were raised by the cooperative members themselves, and some were raised centrally by the cooperative.

Under the current conditions and in the general situation when agricultural production cooperatives are first established: First, agricultural cooperatives have not yet gained a firm foothold economically, and there are certain difficulties in terms of production investment; Second, the collective ideology and awareness of the members cannot keep up with the requirements of collective production, especially the middle peasant members, and the concerns arising from the deeply rooted private ownership concept still exist to varying degrees; Third, the leading backbone members lack experience in managing collective production, and the collective labor habits of the members have yet to be developed. Therefore, the adoption of the two methods of public ownership and collective feeding and private ownership and private feeding for the handling and use of draft animals has led to two different situations.

In the cooperatives where draft animals were converted into shares, owned collectively, and fed collectively, the first problem encountered was: Is the assessed price of the draft animals reasonable? When will the price be repaid to the draft animal owners? These two questions caused great disputes among the poor and middle peasant members. During the high tide of the collectivization movement, and under the extremely active circumstances of the poor peasants, most of the newly developed cooperatives in Hebei Province in the autumn and winter of 1954 had low valuations for draft animals and stipulated long repayment periods. Therefore, the middle peasants who owned draft animals sold them off, or exchanged large ones for small ones and good ones for bad ones, and did not cherish the draft animals, causing the price of draft animals to fall generally. After the price of draft animals fell, everyone cherished the draft animals even less. In some places, natural disasters occurred, and the supply of feed was disrupted, which was one of the reasons for the decline and damage of draft animal prices; but the main reason was the low evaluation and long repayment period for the draft animals of the cooperative members in the collectivization movement. Because of the seasonal fluctuations in market prices, it is not easy to achieve a reasonable assessment of draft animals. Later, in the work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Hebei, the method of using the "average price of three seasons" as a reasonable evaluation was created, and most cooperatives made necessary revisions to unreasonable evaluations, and the problem of draft animal evaluation was largely resolved. However, the "long repayment period," the issue of greatest concern to the middle peasants, has not yet been resolved.

Various regulations have been made in various places regarding the repayment period for the conversion of the price of draft animals of the cooperative members, such as requiring repayment within two or three years and paying a certain amount of interest on the converted price of the livestock. However, limited by economic conditions, it is actually difficult for many cooperatives to repay all the price of draft animals within two or three years. According to a survey of some cooperatives in Jin County, on average, each household has to hand over 100 jin or even more of millet from its labor income each year to repay the conversion of draft animals to the middle peasants. According to a survey in Fanglu Village, Baixiang County, even if the converted price of draft animals and farm tools is paid off in five years, each household will have to bear an average of more than 300 jin of rice each year. This weakens the strength of the cooperative members to invest in other necessary production, especially making it difficult for the poor peasants to cope. Even if agricultural production cooperatives increase production, general members, especially poor peasant members, cannot increase their income. That is to say, the superiority initially displayed by the cooperatives is swallowed up by debt. On the other hand, many backbone members and poor peasant members in the cooperative have the idea that "since we are taking the socialist road, why should we distinguish between yours and mine." They believe that converting livestock into prices and setting a repayment period is just a false account; some people think: "Is it necessary to really repay it? We can't afford to repay it if we really do." Attempt to take advantage of the middle peasants. Therefore, the actual repayment period stipulated in many cooperatives is very long, with vague stipulations such as "three to five years" and "seven to eight years," some stipulating "the first three years as a production fund, and repaid in three to eight or ten years," and some simply saying "year by year." Because of the actual problems and ideological problems mentioned above, this kind of repayment period is actually difficult to fulfill or is not intended to be fulfilled. Therefore, it has caused unease among the middle peasants inside and outside the cooperative. They believe: "Livestock in the cooperative is a waste, kicked away!" "The money of ours in the account is nothing but the moon in the water." Some also said: "When it comes to socialism in ten years, there is no need to repay it." In fact, they are dissatisfied. Therefore, they are not enthusiastic about production in the cooperative, and they say strange things behind their backs, and they do not invest money. Some said: "Take what you can see (livestock, farm tools), the money is gone."

In general new cooperatives that adopt public ownership and collective feeding of draft animals, the next problem encountered is the difficulty in raising grass and fodder, the lack of proper stables, and the lack of experience in collective feeding of draft animals. Except for old cooperatives with a foundation and some particularly good new cooperatives, the livestock are well raised, but the livestock of many cooperatives are improperly fed. The livestock work during the day and are crowded together at night without a place to lie down. Donkeys jump, horses bite, and cattle butt heads, suffering from cold in winter and heat in summer. Therefore, the phenomenon of livestock being thin, sick, and injured is serious. Some cooperatives simply adopted the method of selling livestock to raise livestock because they could not raise enough grass and fodder. The 111 heads of livestock in the Nanpanshui Cooperative in Cheng'an County sold 14 heads to exchange for grass and fodder, one died, and the rest were emaciated. According to a survey of 11 cooperatives in Shunmin Township, Mancheng County, a total of 129 draft animals were sold for grass and fodder, 42 died due to poor management, three had lost their ability to work, and ten had to be helped up and down.

The above situation is common in Hebei Province. Therefore, the issue of draft animals has become one of the central issues of mutual benefit and unity between poor peasant members and middle peasant members, and one of the key issues that must be resolved in order to implement the policy of voluntary mutual benefit and consolidate agricultural cooperatives. Draft animals are different from land and farm tools. They are living, and if the problem is not solved well, not only will the existing livestock be greatly damaged, but it will also affect future propagation, resulting in long-term losses in production.

In agricultural cooperatives that implement private ownership and public use of draft animals, the situation is very different.

In most cooperatives in Xingtai County, Hejian County, and ten counties in the Zhangjiakou area, as well as individual cooperatives in other places, the method of private ownership and rental of draft animals is adopted. Among the 5,944 cooperatives in the Zhangjiakou area, 67.5 percent adopted the method of private ownership and rental. Among the 813 cooperatives in Xingtai County, 647 were privately owned and temporarily rented, and 148 were privately owned and rented for a long time. In places where this method is adopted, the cooperative has less expenses, less trouble, less burden on the members, more income, and the livestock are generally well fed, and the production morale of the members and farmers outside the cooperative is also relatively good. Xingtai County increased its draft animals by 2,574 in 1954; some members of cooperatives increased their investment, changing their small livestock to large livestock and bad livestock to good livestock, and some who did not have livestock in the past also bought livestock. With the increase in draft animals, production has also developed.

Judging from the past situation of implementing the two methods of public ownership and collective feeding and private ownership and self-feeding, it is more beneficial for newly established agricultural production cooperatives to adopt the latter method at present. Adopting this method can better combine the public interests of the cooperative with the personal interests of the members, not only benefiting the members who own draft animals, but also exempting most members from the huge burden of buying draft animals in the first few years, and can better regulate the interests of poor peasants and middle peasants and implement the policy of mutual benefit. At present, the middle peasants' concept of private ownership of draft animals is still quite strong, and the members lack experience in collectively raising livestock; adopting the method of private ownership and public use of draft animals is important for uniting the middle peasants and attracting the middle peasants to take the road of collectivization, and can avoid the shock caused by the implementation of public ownership of draft animals, and can avoid the difficulties caused by the lack of collective raising habits, experience, and material conditions, which is conducive to the consolidation and development of the cooperative, and also conducive to the protection and propagation of draft animals inside and outside the cooperative.

There are also some transitional forms between private ownership and self-feeding for public use and public ownership and public feeding for public use. One transitional form is private ownership and collective feeding, with guaranteed cost rental. In Jin County, in order to solve the difficulties caused by the public ownership of draft animals in the cooperative, this method was tried out in Beixiaowu Village and accepted by the members. Another transitional form is that some draft animals in a cooperative are publicly owned and used, and some draft animals are privately owned, self-fed, and rented. The results of implementing this method in Dongchuankou Cooperative, Xingtai County, proved to be very good. It is based on the gradual increase in the economic conditions of the cooperative, and gradually increases the publicly owned draft animals. These methods can also be adopted under certain conditions.

In order to correctly implement the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, solve the difficulties in unity and management caused by many agricultural cooperatives implementing public ownership of draft animals regardless of conditions, and further consolidate agricultural cooperatives, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently instructed party organizations at all levels again to promote the method of private ownership, self-feeding, and rental by the cooperative in a guided and step-by-step manner. The Provincial Party Committee also specifically stipulated in the instructions: All cooperatives that have too much debt, difficulty in grass and fodder, weak draft animals, and members have opinions due to the implementation of public ownership of draft animals, should persuade the backbone members and members in the cooperative to change to private ownership, self-feeding rental or employment; Cooperatives whose draft animals have already changed (such as selling small ones for large ones, collective purchase of draft animals) can implement a part of public ownership and collective feeding, and a part of private ownership and self-feeding rental or employment according to the opinions of the members and the specific conditions; Cooperatives that adopt the method of private ownership and collective feeding with guaranteed cost rental can generally not be changed if the members have no objection; General old cooperatives and some new cooperatives with better conditions, which have a foundation for implementing public ownership and collective feeding of draft animals, and the members have no objection, can also not be changed. For the above-mentioned methods, reasonable and clear regulations must be made for the rental of rented items, the price of public ownership conversion, the repayment period and interest, and the treatment and compensation for the illness and death of draft animals, and they must be kept in good faith. In order to do a good job in promoting the work of private ownership and public use of draft animals, the Provincial Party Committee requires each county to first select three or five cooperatives for key experiments, gradually promote them after gaining experience, and not adopt a generalized simple approach that ignores the conditions and does not consult with the members. According to the recent experience of some places in trying to change public ownership and public use of draft animals to private ownership and public use, the key lies in helping grassroots workers correctly understand the important significance of implementing the principle of mutual benefit in the issue of draft animals for consolidating agricultural cooperatives and protecting and propagating draft animals. At the same time, it is necessary to use the method of specific accounting to correct the erroneous views of some grassroots workers, backbone members in the cooperative, and poor peasant members that changing from public ownership and public use to private ownership and public use is "detrimental to the poor peasants" and is "promoting the capitalist trend of the middle peasants," and to make them realize that the big benefits of uniting the middle peasants to run agricultural cooperatives well, propagating draft animals, and developing production cannot be forgotten because of the small benefits in front of them. Some people worry that the owners of draft animals will sell the draft animals after the implementation of private ownership and public use, and some people worry that there is a contradiction between public use in the cooperative and self-use by the members. These are indeed issues that should be paid attention to. As long as the remuneration for the use of draft animals is reasonably stipulated, making it profitable for the members who own draft animals, necessary regulations are made after consultation on the method of use, and ideological education is strengthened, these problems can be completely solved.

    河北省农业合作社处理耕畜问题的经验和教训
    冯小风
    耕畜是目前农业生产中除土地以外最重要的生产资料，农业生产合作社对于社员的耕畜怎样处理，是农业合作化运动中的一项极为重要的政策问题。处理办法规定得是不是妥善，直接关系贫农社员中农社员的团结和社的巩固，直接影响对耕畜的保护和繁殖，影响农业生产合作社的生产，甚至影响社外广大农民的生产情绪。
    河北省各地农业生产合作社对社员的耕畜所采取的各种处理办法和实行这些办法的结果，提供了解决这个问题的重要经验和教训。
    河北省十万多个农业生产合作社中，百分之八十多的社对社员的耕畜采取了折价收买、集体所有和集中喂养的办法。其余近百分之二十的社，采用了耕畜私有公用的办法。对于统一使用的私有耕畜，有租用给租金的，有计“工”分红的，也有折价付息的；有归社员个人饲养的，也有集中到社里饲养的。
    在目前条件下，在农业生产合作社初办时的一般情况下：一、农业合作社在经济上还没站稳脚跟，在生产投资方面有一定的困难；二、社员的集体主义思想觉悟还赶不上集体生产的要求，特别是中农社员，在根深蒂固的私有观念基础上产生的顾虑，还或多或少地存在；三、领导骨干没有经营集体生产的经验，社员集体劳动的习惯尚待养成。因此，对耕畜的处理和使用，采取公有伙喂和私有私喂这两种办法，便出现了两种不同的情况。
    在耕畜折价归社、公有伙喂的社里，首先遇到的问题是：评定耕畜的价格是不是合理？什么时候偿还耕畜主的价款？这两个问题，引起了贫农社员和中农社员很大的争执。在合作化运动的高涨时期，在贫农活动极为积极的情况下，河北省各地一九五四年秋冬两季新发展的社，对耕畜的折价多数是偏低的，偿还期大都规定得很长。因此，有耕畜的中农纷纷出卖耕畜或者以大换小、以好换坏，不爱护耕畜，使耕畜的价格普遍下跌。耕畜跌价后，大家就更不爱惜耕畜了。有一些地方，发生了自然灾害，饲料供应失调，曾是耕畜价格下跌和损伤的原因之一；但主要原因还是在合作化运动中对于社员耕畜评价低、还期长。对于耕畜的评价，因为市场价格的季节性变动，要做到评定合理，是不很容易的。后来河北各地在整顿农业生产合作社的工作中，创造了以“三季的平均价格”作为合理评价的办法，大部分社对不合理的评价作了必要的修订，耕畜的评价问题算是大体上解决了。但是，
  “偿还期长”这个最为中农关心的问题，至今还没有解决。
  对于社员耕畜折价的偿还期，各地都作过一些规定，比如，要求在二、三年内偿还，并对牲口折价付予一定的利息。但是，许多社为经济条件所限，实际上要在二、三年内偿还所有的耕畜价款，有一定的困难。根据晋县一些社的调查，平均每家每年得从劳动所得中缴出一百斤甚至还要多的小米，偿还中农的耕畜折款。根据柏乡县方鲁村的调查，即使分五年还清耕畜、农具的折款，每户每年平均也得负担三百多斤米。这样，就削弱了社员对其它必需的生产投资的力量，特别使贫农难以应付。农业生产合作社即便增产了，一般社员特别是贫农社员却不能增加收入。这就是说，合作社初步显示的优越性被债务吞没了。另一方面，不少社内骨干和贫农社员有“既然走社会主义道路，还分什么你的我的”的思想。他们认为，把牲口折成价，订上一个还期，这不过是一笔虚账；有人想：“用得着真还吗？要是真还可还不起。”企图揩中农的油。因此，目前很多社实际规定的偿还期很长，有
  “三、五年”“七、八年”等含糊其词的规定，有的规定“前三年做为生产垫本，三年至八年或十年还清”，甚至仅说是“逐年”还清。因为有上面所说的实际问题和思想问题，所以这种偿还期的规定，实际上是难以兑现或者不打算兑现的。因此，引起社内社外中农的不安。他们认为：“牲口入了社算白搭了，一脚蹬了！”“账上有咱的钱，那不过是水里的月亮。”也有的说：“待十年就到了社会主义，就不用还了。”实际上是不满意的。所以他们在社里生产情绪不高，背后说怪话，有钱不投资。有的说：“看得见的东西（牲口、农具）你们拿去吧，钱是没有了。”
    在采取耕畜公有伙喂的一般新社里，其次遇到的问题便是筹集草料的困难和没有适当的厩圈，没有伙喂耕畜的经验。除有基础的老社和一部分特别好的新社，牲口饲养得还好外，很多社的耕畜喂养不当。牲口白天作工，晚上挤在一起没有卧处，驴蹦、马咬、牛抵头，冬天受冻，夏天受热。因此，牲口瘦弱、闹病、伤亡的现象是严重的。有些社因为凑不起草料，干脆采取了卖牲口养牲口的办法。成安县南盘水社的一百一十一头牲口，卖了十四头换草料，死了一头，其余都消瘦了。据满城县顺民乡十一个社的调查，共有耕畜一百二十九头，因换草料卖了四十二头，因管理不善死亡七头，有三头已失去工作能力，有十头牲口得扶起扶卧。
    上述情况在河北省是带有普遍性的。因此，耕畜问题便成为贫农社员和中农社员互利、团结的中心问题之一，成为贯彻自愿互利政策、巩固合作社必须解决的关键问题之一。耕畜和土地、农具不同，它是活的，问题解决得不好，不但现有的牲口会大量损伤，而且影响今后的增殖，招致生产上长期的损失。
    在实行耕畜私有公用的农业合作社，情况就大不相同了。
    在邢台县、河间县和张家口专区十个县的多数社，以及其他地方个别的社里，对耕畜是采用私有租用办法的。张家口专区五千九百四十四个社当中，采用私有租用办法的社达百分之六十七点五。邢台县的八百一十三个社，有六百四十七个社是私有临时租用，一百四十八个社是私有长期租用。采取这种办法的地方，社内开支少、麻烦少，社员负担少、收入多，牲口一般的都喂养得很好，社员和社外农民的生产情绪也比较好。邢台县一九五四年增加耕畜二千五百七十四头；有些社的社员，增加投资，把自己的小牲口换成大牲口，坏牲口换成好牲口，有些过去没有牲口的也买了牲口。耕畜增加了，生产也就发展了。
    从过去实行公有伙喂和私有自喂两种办法的情况看来，目前，新建的农业生产合作社采用后一种办法是比较有利的。采取这一种办法，能更好地把社的公共利益同社员的个人利益结合起来，不仅使有耕畜的社员有利可图，而且能免除多数社员在最初几年内为收买耕畜而来的巨额负担，能更好地调节贫农和中农的利益，贯彻互利政策。目前中农对耕畜的私有观念还是相当浓厚的，社员对于集体饲养牲口是缺乏经验的；采取耕畜私有公用的办法，对于团结中农、吸引中农走合作化道路有重要作用，可以避免因实行耕畜公有而引起震动，可以避免因集体饲养的习惯、经验和物质条件的缺乏而发生的困难，既有利于社的巩固和发展，也有利于社内社外保护和增殖耕畜。
    还有一些介于私有自喂公用和公有公喂公用两者之间的过渡形式。一种过渡形式是私有伙喂，保本租用。在晋县，为解决耕畜归社公有而引起的困难，曾在北小吾村试行了这种办法，为社员们所接受。还有一种过渡形式是在一个社内有一部分耕畜公有公用，有一部分耕畜私有自喂租用。这种办法，在邢台县东川口社实行的结果，证明是很好的。它是根据社内经济条件逐步上升的情况，而逐步增加公有耕畜的。这些办法，在一定条件下也是可以采用的。
    为了正确贯彻自愿互利政策，解决许多农业合作社由于不顾条件实行耕畜公有而引起的在团结方面和管理方面的困难问题，进一步巩固农业合作社，中共河北省委已在最近再次指示各级党的组织，有领导有步骤地推行耕畜私有自喂、由社租用的办法。省委在指示中还具体规定了：凡因实行耕畜公有以致债务多、草料困难、耕畜瘦弱、社员有意见的社，应说服社内骨干分子和社员，改变成私有私喂租用或雇用；耕畜已有变动（如卖小换大、集体购买了耕畜）的社，可以根据社员意见和具体条件，实行一部分公有伙喂、一部分私有自喂租用或雇用的办法；采用私有伙喂保本租用的社，如果社员没有意见，一般可不再改变；条件较好的一般老社和某些新社，实行耕畜公有伙喂已有基础，社员又没有意见，也可以不再改变。实行上述各种办法，对租用的租金、公有折价的价格、还期和利息，以及耕畜病亡的治疗和赔偿，必须作合理的明确的规定，并且要守信用。为了把推行耕畜私有公用的工作做好，省委要求各县先选择三、五个社，进行重点试验，取得经验以后逐步推广，不可采取不顾条件又不和社员商量的一般化的简单做法。根据最近一些地方试行把耕畜公有公用改为私有公用的经验看来，关键在于帮助基层工作人员正确认识在耕畜问题上贯彻互利原则对于巩固农业合作社和保护、增殖耕畜的重要意义。同时，要用具体算账的办法，纠正某些基层工作人员、社内骨干分子和贫农社员认为由公有公用改为私有公用“对贫农不利”，是“助长中农资本主义趋势”等错误看法，要使他们认识到不可因眼前的小利而忘掉团结中农办好农业合作社、增殖耕畜、发展生产的大利。有些人担心实行私有公用办法以后耕畜主会卖掉耕畜，有些人顾虑社内公用和社员自用有矛盾。这些确实是应当注意的问题。只要对使用耕畜的报酬规定的合理，使有耕畜的社员有利可图，对使用办法经过协商作出必要的规定，并且加强思想教育工作，这些问题是完全可以解决的。
