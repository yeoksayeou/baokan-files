The fact that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was able to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks for so long before being exposed proves that many of us are not vigilant enough against hidden counter-revolutionary elements. This situation exists not only on the cultural front but also on the economic and other fronts; not only in cities but also in rural areas. Recent reports in newspapers across the country have exposed many such cases, such as the case of counter-revolutionary element Liang Ti You sabotaging the Liang Jiahe Vegetable Cooperative in Kunming, the case of counter-revolutionary element Kang En poisoning livestock at the Liu Delin Agricultural Cooperative in Tongxian, Hebei, the case of counter-revolutionary element Zhao Zhu Shi sabotaging the Guangming First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xianyang, Shaanxi, published in this newspaper on the 26th, and the case of hidden counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Ping Shun County, Shanxi, published in this newspaper today, are all proof of this.

From the very first day of the establishment of the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, led by prominent labor models such as Li Shun Da and Shen Ji Lan, the counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Lai Quan and Zhang Bian Ze pretended to be "active" and infiltrated the cooperative, and after gaining trust, they became increasingly unrestrained in carrying out sabotage activities. It took more than three years for them to be exposed. This case tells us that many comrades have been blinded by victory and have become politically paralyzed to the point of completely losing vigilance.

Zhang Lai Quan and Zhang Bian Ze, the two criminals, were well-known counter-revolutionary elements in the Xi Gou Township of Ping Shun, and were able to openly infiltrate the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, with one serving as the production team leader, then the production brigade leader, and then a member of the cooperative affairs committee, while the other controlled the entire cooperative's economic power, serving as the accountant. Later, one fraudulently obtained the honor of model team leader, and the other fraudulently obtained the title of labor model. Although pretending to be active was the disguise these two criminals used to gain trust, the more important reason they were able to achieve their goals was due to the following idea held by the Xi Gou Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party: "Although Zhang Lai Quan and Zhang Bian Ze participated in counter-revolutionary organizations in the past, they have been educated by the government and released with leniency; now that the people are in power, what else can they dare to do?" This paralyzing thought caused them to forget the Party's instructions about the increasingly sharp and complex class struggle during the transition period, and they mistakenly believed that it was no longer necessary to pay attention to counter-revolutionary elements, nor was it necessary to pay attention to the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements, thus disarming themselves ideologically and opening the door to counter-revolutionary elements. Is this lesson limited to Xi Gou Township in Ping Shun?

Some people with good intentions are easily deceived by temporary superficial phenomena and those who speak sweet words and act in accordance with their own wishes, because they look at people and things from a perspective that is divorced from the class viewpoint. The leading staff of the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, based on the initial "active" pretense of Zhang Lai Quan and Zhang Bian Ze upon joining the cooperative, completely erased their criminal history and gave them unlimited trust; believing that they "are still capable," "easy to lead," "have been well reformed," and "have made ideological progress." However, they failed to notice a series of subsequent sabotage activities by these two counter-revolutionary elements, such as sowing discord among Party comrades, undermining the unity of Party members and non-Party members, undermining the unity of poor and middle peasants, and repeatedly sabotaging production and the cooperative's public property. Even when the masses criticized the cooperative's leaders for "forgetting their own people and favoring the enemy," it did not arouse the vigilance of the cooperative's leaders, who instead believed that the masses were narrow-minded and suspicious. In fact, these leaders had fallen behind the masses: it was not that the masses were suspicious, but that the leaders themselves had lost their class vigilance; it was not that the masses were narrow-minded, but that the leaders themselves were infinitely lenient and condoned counter-revolutionary elements. It is true that our Party and the People's Government adopt a policy of combining suppression and leniency towards counter-revolutionary elements; in recent years, under the guidance of the Party and the government's correct policies, many counter-revolutionary elements have completely repented and started anew through labor reform, supervision, and education. However, we do not believe that any counter-revolutionary element can magically transform into a Buddha overnight. In addition to imposing necessary punishments and discipline on counter-revolutionary elements in accordance with the law, we must also maintain a high degree of vigilance against them and educate the broad masses of people to carry out daily supervision of them. This not only prevents them from committing evil again but also more effectively supervises them to truly reform. It is extremely dangerous to not only absorb counter-revolutionary elements into the cooperative, as the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative did, but also hand over the power of production and economy to them and blindly trust them.

Many people also have a naive idea: how can it be counter-revolutionary and counter-revolutionary activities if there is no arson or murder? They think that counter-revolutionary elements must be ferocious and evil-looking fellows; how could they be people who are "gentle and kind," appear "honest," and work "actively," or how could they be people who treat young people "enthusiastically," are "kind and approachable," can write poetry, write articles, and talk about Marxism-Leninism? They do not understand that counter-revolutionary elements are extremely insidious and cunning, and that counter-revolutionary elements often adopt various different means depending on different situations and different targets in order to carry out sabotage, and do not just use the means of arson and murder; many people also do not understand that now is no longer the world of reactionaries, and counter-revolutionary elements in most cases do not easily openly commit murder and arson, they have cunningly put on masks and adopted the "tactics of crawling into the belly," attempting to infiltrate the ranks of the people, gain trust, and establish "strongholds." The insidiousness of these counter-revolutionary elements lies in the fact that their insults do not contain dirty words, they use whips wrapped in rubber-coated steel wires to beat people, and they use bloodless knives to kill people. Just look at the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and aren't Zhang Lai Quan and Zhang Bian Ze also like this? Zhang Lai Quan and Zhang Bian Ze verbally supported agricultural cooperativization, but secretly used the most vicious methods to sabotage production, harm the interests of cooperative members, undermine the unity of poor and middle peasants, undermine the Party's class line, and vainly attempt to fundamentally destroy agricultural production cooperatives. They treated Comrade Li Shun Da with full support on the surface, even taking the lead in giving Comrade Li Shun Da more work points, but as soon as they turned their backs, even the smallest loophole, such as Comrade Li Shun Da occasionally failing to sweep snow with the masses, was used by them to carry out sabotage activities. Zhao Zhu Shi, the counter-revolutionary element who infiltrated the Guangming First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xianyang, Shaanxi, also used this insidious method to carry out sabotage, he was not only the first to sign up to join the cooperative, but also reported at the cooperative joining registration meeting how he "persuaded the whole family to agree to join the cooperative," and after joining the cooperative, he everywhere promoted that "a cooperative cannot be led without culture," deceiving his way to becoming a member and accountant of the cooperative's management committee. When the three elected director and deputy directors were all from Nan Village, he instigated Bei Village to make trouble and "separate from Nan Village as soon as possible." When cooperative director Yang Bing Yan went to the county to attend a meeting and the cooperative was under the responsibility of deputy director Ma Tian Sheng, he further said to Ma Tian Sheng, on the basis of consistently sowing discord between them: "Second Brother, no matter how great the cooperative's achievements are, they all belong to Yang Bing Yan, look, Yang Bing Yan goes to the county to attend meetings and talk about work; we might as well just manage less, and mess up the cooperative's production, and see what Yang Bing Yan will say when he goes to the county!" He suggested killing livestock, leaving fields uncultivated, and deliberately used his position as an accountant to incorrectly record work points, causing the cooperative members to quarrel with each other, and sure enough, he really "messed up" the cooperative's production. Please think about it, aren't these sabotage activities, just like arson and murder, causing significant harm to our socialist transformation of agriculture? As the saying goes, it is easy to dodge an arrow in the open, but difficult to guard against an arrow in the dark. We must not become complacent and careless just because the enemy is not committing murder and arson every day. When we discover shortcomings and errors in our work, we must carefully identify whether they are caused by a lack of experience or by deliberate sabotage; when we hear dissatisfied opinions or rumors, we must also distinguish whether they come from the lack of understanding of backward masses or from the fabrication and instigation of saboteurs. We must understand that in a period of intensified class struggle, the more powerful the people are, the more insidious and cunning the enemy will be, and the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements will become more complex.

Slack and paralyzing thoughts are right-leaning thoughts, thoughts that actually forget class struggle or actually deny class struggle. The Party has repeatedly pointed out that in the process of realizing the country's socialist industrialization and building a socialist society, class struggle is becoming deeper and more acute. However, some people do not use this viewpoint to analyze the current struggle and guide their work and thinking. Some people believe that after the land reform and production movement, the economy of the broad masses of peasants has improved, and with the restriction of the rich peasant economy, the rich peasant economy has declined, and the countryside has been "middle-peasantized," and "there is no need for class struggle"; therefore, they fail to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and lose their vigilance against class alien elements. Other comrades have seen the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the peasants, and believe that there is no problem for the peasants to take the socialist road, and things are easy to handle, so they wholeheartedly bury themselves in leading construction and leading production, and are indifferent to political struggle. At present, the countryside not only has the side of increased mass awareness, the development of the cooperativization movement, and things being easy to handle; although this is the main side and the mainstream, we must never forget that there is also the side of the remaining capitalist forces doing everything possible to obstruct and resist socialist transformation. If we ignore this side, right-leaning thoughts will arise and grow, and we will become insensitive to the activities of the enemy and turn a blind eye. We must criticize this right-leaning thought in order to raise our vigilance and strengthen the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements.

Obviously, we cannot just shout slogans about raising vigilance. We need to educate the whole Party and the people of the whole country, learn lessons, and recognize the current situation of increasingly complex and profound class struggle with the development of socialist construction and socialist transformation through the exposure of each counter-revolutionary case, the Hu Feng incident among intellectuals, and the counter-revolutionary activities in the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative among peasants, recognize the truth that the eliminated classes will not be willing to die, unite, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely suppress these counter-revolutionary forces. The Ping Shun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party accepted the lessons of the sabotage of the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative by counter-revolutionary elements and made a decision, instructing the Party branches in the whole county to conduct study and inspection, and to lead all cooperatives and mutual aid groups to conduct study and inspection in a planned way, overcome paralyzing thoughts, raise vigilance, raise class consciousness, review cadres, purge all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives, and strengthen public security work to ensure the smooth progress of socialist transformation. This is a very necessary measure. Only in this way can we purge all hidden counter-revolutionary elements and ensure the smooth progress of the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    肃清暗藏的反革命分子  保卫农业互助合作运动
    胡风反革命集团在革命阵营中混了这样久才被揭穿，证明了我们很多人对于暗藏的反革命分子的警惕性是不高的。这种情形不但在文化战线上存在，在经济战线和其他战线上也存在；不但在城市中存在，也在农村中存在。最近的各地报纸上揭露的很多这种案件，如反革命分子梁体有破坏昆明市梁家河蔬菜合作社的案件，反革命分子康恩毒死河北通县刘德林农业合作社牲口的案件，二十六日本报发表的反革命分子赵柱石破坏陕西咸阳光明第一农业生产合作社案件，以及今天本报发表的山西平顺县破获的暗藏反革命分子破坏金星农林牧生产合作社的案件，都是证明。
    从著名的劳动模范李顺达、申纪兰等同志所领导的金星农林牧生产合作社成立的第一天起，反革命分子张来全和张扁则就伪装“积极”混了进来，并且在取得了信任之后，越来越放肆地进行着破坏活动。经过三年多时间，才被破获。这个案件告诉我们，有许多同志因为被胜利冲昏了头脑，已经在政治上麻痹到完全丧失警惕的程度。
    张来全和张扁则两个罪犯，在平顺西沟乡原是众所周知的反革命分子，竟能公然混入金星农林牧生产合作社，并且一个由担任生产组长、而生产大队长、而社务委员，另一个掌握了全社的经济大权，担任了会计；以后，一个骗取了模范组长的光荣，另一个骗取了劳动模范的称号。伪装积极固然是这两个罪犯所借以取得信任的外衣，但是他们所以能达到目的，更重要的却是由于中共西沟乡支部的这样一种想法：“张来全和张扁则虽然过去参加过反革命组织，但是已经经过政府的教育，宽大释放；现在人民掌握了天下，他们还敢怎么样？”这种麻痹思想使他们忘掉了党关于过渡时期阶级斗争更尖锐更复杂的指示，他们竟以为现在可以不必重视反革命分子，也可以不必重视同反革命分子的斗争，这就从思想上解除了自己的武装，给反革命分子开了大门。这个教训，难道只限于平顺西沟乡吗？
    有一些具有善良愿望的人，由于离开了阶级观点去看人看事，很容易被一时的表面的现象所迷惑，很容易被那些甜言蜜语顺着自己心意办事的人所迷惑。金星农林牧生产合作社的领导工作人员凭着张来全和张扁则入社初期伪装“积极”的一点本钱，就一笔抹掉了他们的罪恶历史，给了他们以无限信任；认为他们“还能干”，“又好领导”，“改造得好”，“思想进步”。而对于以后这两个反革命分子一连串的破坏活动，如挑拨党内同志的关系，破坏党员和非党员的团结，破坏贫农和中农的团结，以致于一再破坏生产，破坏社的公共财产等等，竟一点没有发觉。甚至群众已经批评社的领导人员“忘了自己人，看上了敌人”，还没有能引起社的领导人员的警惕，反而认为群众狭隘，群众疑心大。而事实上，却是这些领导人员落在了群众的后面：不是群众疑心大，而是领导人员自己丧失了阶级警惕性；不是群众狭隘，而是领导人员自己宽大无边纵容了反革命分子。诚然，我们党和人民政府对待反革命分子是采取镇压和宽大相结合的政策的；几年来，在党和政府的正确政策的指导下，有不少反革命分子经过劳动改造、管制和教育，已经彻底悔改，重新做人。但是，我们并不相信任何反革命分子都能够摇身一变，立地成佛。我们对反革命分子除了依照法律进行必要的惩处和管教以外，还必须对他们保持高度的警惕性，教育广大人民群众对他们进行日常的监督，这不只是可以防止他们重新作恶，而且还可以更有效地监督他们真正改邪归正。像金星农林牧生产合作社那样，不但吸收反革命分子入社，并且把生产和经济的大权送到他们手里，盲目地给予信任，是极其危险的。
    还有许多人有一种天真的想法：既没有放火，也没有杀人，怎么会是反革命分子和反革命活动呢？他们以为既是反革命分子，就一定是凶神恶煞，横眉竖眼的家伙；哪里会是待人“和和气气”，表现“老实”，劳动“积极”的人，或者哪里会是“热情”对待青年，为人“亲切可近”，会做诗，会写文章，会讲马克思列宁主义的人呢？他们不懂得反革命分子是十分阴险诡诈的，反革命分子为了进行破坏，常常是在看不同情况，不同对象，采取各种各样不同手段的，而不只是采用一种杀人放火的手段；许多人也不懂得现在已经不是反动派的天下了，反革命分子在多数情形下并不轻易地公开杀人放火，他们已经狡猾地戴上假面具，采用“钻进肚皮去的战术”，企图混进人民的队伍，骗取信任，建立“据点”。这些反革命分子的阴险，就在于骂人不带脏字眼，打人用的是橡皮包着钢丝的鞭子，杀人是用的不见血的刀子。试看胡风反革命集团是这样的，张来全和张扁则不也是这样的吗？张来全和张扁则嘴上拥护农业合作化，暗地里却用着最毒辣的办法，破坏生产，损害社员利益，破坏贫农和中农的团结，破坏党的阶级路线，妄想从根本上来搞垮农业生产合作社。他们对待李顺达同志，当面事事拥护，甚至出头给李顺达同志多评劳动日，可是一背过脸来，哪怕是最小的空子，李顺达同志偶尔一次没有能同群众一起去扫雪，也被他们利用来进行破坏活动。混进陕西咸阳光明第一农业生产合作社的反革命分子赵柱石，也是施用这种阴险手段进行破坏的，他不只是第一个报名入社，而且在入社报名大会上报告他如何“说服全家人同意入社”，入社后处处宣传“没有文化领导不了合作社”，骗到社的管理委员会委员兼会计。当选出的三个正副社主任都是南村人时，他就挑拨北村起来闹“趁早和南村分社”。当社主任杨秉彦到县上去开会，社里由副主任马天升负责时，他在一贯挑拨他们的关系基础上，进一步对马天升说：“二哥，社里的功劳再大，也是人家杨秉彦的，你看上县开会谈啥工作，都是人家杨秉彦去；干脆咱们不如少管事，把社的生产弄个稀烂，看他杨秉彦到县上去说个啥！”他出主意弄死牲口，弄荒田禾，还故意利用会计的职权，错记劳动日，使得社员之间互相吵闹，果然就把社的生产真的“弄烂”了。请大家想想，难道这些破坏活动，不是同杀人放火一样，会使我们对农业的社会主义改造事业遭受到重大的危害吗？俗话说，明箭易躲，暗箭难防。我们决不能因为敌人没有天天杀人放火，就麻痹大意起来。我们发现了工作中的缺点和错误，要细心识别它究竟是由于缺乏经验所造成的，还是由于故意的破坏；听到了不满的意见或谣言，也必须区别它是出自落后群众的不了解，还是破坏分子的捏造和挑拨。我们必须懂得，在阶级斗争更加尖锐化的时期，人民的力量越是强大，敌人就越是阴险狡猾，同反革命分子的斗争也越加复杂了。
    松懈和麻痹的思想是右倾的思想，是实际上忘记阶级斗争或实际上否认阶级斗争的思想。党一再指出过，在实现国家社会主义工业化和建成社会主义社会的过程中，阶级斗争更加深刻，更加尖锐。但是有些人却不用这种观点来分析当前的斗争，来指导自己的工作和思想。有些人认为经过土地改革和生产运动，广大农民经济上升了，加上对于富农经济的限制，富农经济衰落下来，农村“中农化”了，“用不着阶级斗争了”；于是，敌我不分，对阶级异己分子丧失了警惕。另外一些同志看到了农业合作化运动的开展，农民社会主义觉悟程度的提高，认为农民走社会主义的道路不成问题了，事情好办了，于是一心埋头于领导建设，领导生产，对政治斗争漠不关心。目前，农村里不只是有群众觉悟提高、合作化运动开展、事情好办的一面；虽然这是主要的一面、是主流，但是我们也千万不要忘记还有资本主义残余势力千方百计地阻挠反抗社会主义改造的一面。如果忽视了这一面，就会产生和滋长着右倾思想，就会对敌人的活动嗅觉不灵，熟视无睹。我们必须批判这种右倾思想，才能提高警惕，加强同反革命分子进行斗争。
    显然的，我们不能空喊提高警惕。我们需要通过每一个反革命案件的揭发，在知识分子中通过胡风事件，在农民中通过金星农林牧生产合作社中的反革命活动事件，来教育全党和全国人民，吸取教训，认清目前随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的发展，阶级斗争日益复杂化和深刻化的形势，认识被消灭的阶级是不会甘心死亡的真理，团结起来，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地将这些反革命势力镇压下去。中共平顺县委接受了反革命分子破坏金星农林牧生产合作社的教训作出决定，指示全县的党的支部，要进行学习和检查，并要有计划地领导所有的合作社和互助组进行学习和检查，克服麻痹思想，提高警惕性，提高阶级觉悟，审查干部，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，巩固和发展农业生产合作社，加强治安保卫工作，以保障社会主义改造的顺利进行。这是十分必要的措施。只有这样，才能够肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，保证农业的社会主义改造事业的顺利进展。
