They all unanimously pledged: We must constantly improve our political understanding, study hard, abide by flight rules and discipline, pay attention to flight safety, take care of electrical equipment, and complete our learning tasks. Some of the students are members of aviation model groups from Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Shenyang. They said: The ideal we have been waiting for day and night, the path to the ocean of the sky, is about to be realized. We are determined to dedicate everything we have to the motherland's aviation industry.
    Gliding is the most economical and effective way to train a large number of aviation reserves, and it is of great significance to strengthening the motherland's aviation construction and economic construction. This school will continuously train gliding instructors, laying a good foundation for the widespread development of gliding in the future.

    我国第一个滑翔学校开学
    中央国防体育俱乐部滑翔学校已在六月十二日正式开学。这是新中国的第一个滑翔学校。
    滑翔学员是来自全国各地具有高中文化程度的青年，一个个身体健壮、精神饱满。他们都一致提出保证：一定要不断地提高自己的政治水平，努力学习，遵守飞行规则和纪律，注意飞行的安全，爱护电动器材，完成学习任务。学员中有的是北京、上海、重庆、沈阳等地的航空模型组员，他们说：我们日夜盼望的、通往空中海洋的理想将要实现了，我们决心把自己的一切献给祖国的航空事业。
    滑翔是培养大量航空后备力量最经济有效的办法，对加强祖国的航空建设和经济建设都有着很重大的意义。这个学校将不断地培养出滑翔教练人员，为将来广泛开展滑翔运动打下良好的基础。
