    Geological Surveyors Active in Northern and Southern Tianshan
    By our reporter Shen Shi
    Summer makes the Tianshan Mountains even more beautiful. The areas along the rivers are shaded by green trees; in the Junggar Basin, wild oleaster emit a rich fragrance. These days, in the remote wilderness of this area, in the sandy depressions where drought-resistant plants grow, one can often see geological surveying team members walking back and forth. They are eager to discover abundant coal seams and survey promising oil structures in our country’s rich Xinjiang Province.

    In the Tianshan Mountains, where there is year-round snow cover, showers often occur now. Members of the barite geological team need to carry cotton clothing and rain gear to climb the high mountains. In areas with bitter or no water, water is very precious to the survey team members. They often have to transport water back dozens of kilometers from the campsite by car.

    In the struggle against various difficulties, and with the help of Soviet experts, the geological survey team members have gradually grown. Two years ago, Fan Chenglong was still a student at the Beijing Institute of Geology. With the help of Soviet experts Uvarov and Irina Ivanova, he has now taken on the task of geological surveying team leader. Young women Liu Jingkuan and Niu Jiabi were originally students at the Beijing Institute of Geology and only came to Xinjiang in May 1954. This year, Liu Jingkuan serves as the leader of a survey team with more than eighty people; Niu Jiabi has become an intern engineer, independently operating a power engine in a field electrical measuring station. The petroleum geological survey team has also trained many workers from the Uyghur, Kazakh, and Russian ethnic groups.

    The survey team's activities have received enthusiastic help from people of all ethnic groups. They actively supply the survey personnel with vegetables, sheep, and other foods, and guide the survey teams. With the support of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province, geological survey team members are bravely marching towards the underground treasures of the motherland.

    活跃在天山南北的地质勘测人员
    本报记者  沈石
    夏天，天山南北显得更加美丽。水流经过的地带，绿树成荫；准噶尔盆地上，野生的沙枣发出浓郁的芳香。这些日子，在这一带的荒山僻野里，在生长着耐旱植物的沙窝中，经常可以见到地质勘测队队员们徒步地来来去去。他们渴望着在祖国富饶的新疆省发现出蕴藏丰富的煤层，勘测到好的石油构造。
    在终年积雪的天山丛中，现在时常会下起阵雨。重晶石地质队的队员，需要带着棉衣、雨具爬上高山。在苦水和无水的地区，水，对于勘测队员非常珍贵。他们往往要到离宿营地几十公里以外的地方，用汽车把水运回来。
    在同各种困难作斗争中，在苏联专家的帮助下，地质勘测队员们逐渐成长起来。范成龙两年以前还是北京地质学院的学生，经过苏联专家乌瓦洛夫和伊林娜·伊万诺娃的帮助，现在他已担当起地质测量队队长的任务。年轻的姑娘刘敬宽和牛家璧原来都是北京地质学院的学生，一九五四年五月间才到新疆。今年，刘敬宽在一个有八十多个人的测量队里担任了队长；牛家璧成了实习工程师，在野外电测站里单独地操纵着动力机。石油地质勘测队还培养了许多维吾尔、哈萨克、俄罗斯等民族的工人。
    勘测队的活动，得到了各族人民的热情帮助。他们积极供应给勘测人员蔬菜、羊只等食物，为勘测队带路。在新疆省各族人民的支持下，地质勘测队员们正在勇敢地向着祖国的地下宝藏进军。
