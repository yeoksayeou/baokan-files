    Shorten Hearth Repair Time, Produce More Steel Ingots
    Liu Xianqiu
    In China's open-hearth steelmaking production, there has always been a very serious problem: the hearth deteriorates quickly and severely. After only three to five days of steelmaking, the furnace has to be shut down for hearth repair. In 1950, the production time occupied by hearth repair in steelmaking workshops nationwide was generally around 18%. Although years of efforts by steelmaking staff have gradually reduced the time spent on repairing hearths, in 1954, the hearth repair time for general open-hearth furnaces was still around 7% or 8%, while in advanced Soviet steelmaking workshops, it was only 3.4% in 1951. The long downtime seriously affected production.
    In September 1954, Soviet expert Comrade Lank introduced to China a very successful method of hearth repair from the Soviet Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Works. Its characteristic is to change the "thin-layer application of hearth repair materials, mixing with steel slag, and layer-by-layer burn-through" method, which has always been used in steelmaking production, to "thick-layer application, mixing with iron oxide scale, and rapid burn-through." This not only reduced the number of application layers and shortened the repair time, but also improved the quality of hearth repair. With the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the director and furnace protection chief technician of Anshan Iron and Steel Works personally took charge of promoting this new hearth repair method, and achieved remarkable results. In the past, the hearth had to be repaired after every ten heats of steel produced, but now it can be repaired after more than twenty heats, and the hot shutdown repair rate has been reduced from 12.43% to 2.8%.
    In February this year, the Ministry of Heavy Industry organized representatives from the open-hearth workshops of its affiliated steel plants to go to Anshan to learn about this advanced experience in hearth repair. During the study period, expert Lank gave detailed reports and answers to various questions related to this experience, and comrades from Anshan furnace protection introduced specific operating methods.
    After returning to their plants, the representatives of each plant promoted this new hearth repair method, which has significantly improved the hearth conditions of each plant's open-hearth furnaces. In the past, Tianjin Steel Plant had to repair the hearth after every seventeen heats of steel produced, but now it has increased to about thirty heats, and the hot shutdown repair rate has been reduced from 7% to 2%. It is estimated that the implementation of this advanced experience will increase the national output of steel ingots by about 60,000 to 70,000 tons this year. Because the hearth is more solid and durable, it has also created conditions for improving steel quality and smelting higher-grade steel.

### 缩短补炉时间，多出钢锭

    缩短补炉时间，多出钢锭
    刘贤逑
    在我国平炉炼钢生产中，一直存在一个很严重的问题，就是炉底损坏得又快又厉害，炼不了三、五天钢，便得把炉子停下来烧补炉底。一九五○年全国炼钢车间因烧补炉底而占用的生产时间普遍都在百分之十八左右，几年来虽然由于炼钢工作人员的努力，逐渐减少了修补炉底的时间，但一九五四年一般平炉的烧补炉底时间仍在百分之七、八左右，而苏联先进的炼钢车间，在一九五一年不过百分之三点四。由于停工时间多，严重地影响了生产。
    一九五四年九月，苏联专家兰克同志给我国介绍了苏联库茨涅茨钢铁厂一种非常成功的烧补炉底方法，它的特点是把过去炼钢生产中一向沿用的
  “补炉材料分层薄铺、掺用钢渣、分层烧透”的办法，改为“厚层铺补、掺用氧化铁皮、迅速烧透”。这样既减少了铺补层次，缩短了烧补时间，又提高了烧补炉底的质量。在苏联专家的热诚帮助下，鞍钢炼钢厂厂长和护炉总技师亲自掌握推行了这一新的烧补炉底办法，获得了显著成效。过去每生产十炉钢就要烧补炉底，现在可出二十多炉钢才进行烧补，热停工修补率已由过去的百分之十二点四三降低到百分之二点八。
    今年二月间，重工业部组织了所属各炼钢厂平炉车间的代表们到鞍钢学习这个烧补炉底的先进经验。在学习期间，兰克专家详细地报告和解答了有关这一经验的各项问题，鞍钢护炉工作同志介绍了具体操作方法。
    各厂代表们回厂后都推广了这个新的烧补炉底法，使得各厂平炉炉底情况都有了显著的改善，天津炼钢厂过去每生产十七炉钢就须修补炉底，现在已提高到三十炉左右，热停工修补率已由过去的百分之七降低到百分之二。估计今年全国各钢厂因推行这个先进经验而增产的钢锭约达六万至七万吨，由于炉底更加坚固耐用，也为改善钢的质量和冶炼更高级的钢创造了条件。
