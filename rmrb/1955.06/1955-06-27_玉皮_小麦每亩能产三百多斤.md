"Yu Pi" Wheat Yields Over 300 Jin Per Mu

The 20.7 mu of "Yu Pi" wheat in the Ge Wei Agricultural Production Cooperative, Matou Township, Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, achieved a high yield. The average yield was 336 jin per mu, more than double the average yield of local wheat varieties. Among them, a 1.38 mu plot yielded 968 jin, equivalent to 700 jin per mu. "Yu Pi" wheat is an improved variety with large ears, many grains, strong stalks, resistance to lodging, and strong resistance to waterlogging and disease. This year, when the Ge Wei Agricultural Production Cooperative selected this variety, they implemented close planting, reasonable fertilization, and careful weeding, ensuring a high yield. After the "Yu Pi" wheat harvest, the cooperative retained more than 6,900 jin of quality seeds, preparing to expand the planting area of "Yu Pi" wheat this year.

    “玉皮”小麦每亩能产三百多斤
    安徽省怀远县马头乡葛圩农业生产合作社的二十亩七分“玉皮”小麦，获得高额产量。平均每亩收粮三百三十六斤，超过当地小麦品种平均产量一倍左右。其中有一亩三分八厘地产量为九百六十八斤，每亩合七百斤。“玉皮”小麦是一种改良品种，穗大粒多，秸秆坚硬，不易倒伏，耐水性和抗病力都强。今年葛圩农业生产合作社选种这种品种时，实行了密植，合理施肥，并注意锄草，保证了高额产量。这个社“玉皮”小麦丰收后，已把六千九百多斤良种保留，准备今年扩大“玉皮”小麦的播种面积。（本报集体通讯员安徽日报编辑部）
