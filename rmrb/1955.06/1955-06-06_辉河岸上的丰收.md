    Harvest on the Banks of the Hui River
    On the Hulunbuir Grassland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the spring water of the Hui River is flowing through newly built canals to the green pastures, and herds of cattle and sheep are grazing on both banks.
    Before this pastoral drinking water canal was built, although this grassland grew excellent forage suitable for livestock to graze on in all seasons, it could not be used for grazing livestock for many years due to lack of water. Last autumn, after the construction of this pastoral drinking water canal, which had never existed in history, the local Mongolians and Solon people happily drove their livestock here, making this grassland, which had been barren for many years, lively again.
    More than 300 Mongolian herder households in the New Barag Left Banner came to the pasture on the west bank of the Hui River. They organized various mutual aid teams for production, built sheds for livestock, and stored sufficient fodder, safely passing through the severe winter. Now, they have successfully completed the lambing work in this pasture with water and grass, with a total of more than 26,000 young animals born, with a survival rate of over 98%. On average, each herder participating in pastoral labor received thirty-five young animals. (Xinhua News Agency)

    辉河岸上的丰收
    在内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔草原上，辉河的春水正顺着新修的渠道流向绿色的牧场，两岸放牧着成群的牛羊。
    当这条牧业饮水渠还没有兴修的时候，这一带草原上虽然生长着适合牲畜四季饲用的优良牧草，但因为缺水，多年不能放牧牲畜。去年秋天，开了这条历史上还没有过的牧业饮水渠以后，附近的蒙古人和索伦人欢天喜地地赶着牲畜移到这里，使这片荒芜多年的草原开始热闹起来。
    新巴尔虎左翼旗有三百多户蒙族牧民，来到辉河西岸的牧场上。他们组织了各种生产互助组，给牧畜搭盖棚圈，储存下充足的草料，人畜安全度过了严寒的季节。现在，他们在这块有水有草的牧场上顺利地结束了接羔工作，共接产二万六千多头幼畜，成活率达到百分之九十八以上。平均每个参加牧业劳动的牧民，得到三十五头幼畜。（新华社）
