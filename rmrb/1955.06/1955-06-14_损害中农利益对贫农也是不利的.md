Harming the Interests of Middle Peasants is Also Detrimental to Poor Peasants
　　Zhong Xia
The Luan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province recently conducted a relatively comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the implementation of specific agricultural collectivization policies in five agricultural producers' cooperatives and discovered that some cooperatives had harmed the interests of middle peasants in aspects such as land valuation and compensation for draught animals and farm tools. For example, the Beicheng Agricultural Cooperative rented a waterwheel from a middle-peasant member but had not paid any rent for two years. The cooperative casually used the members’ privately owned nine seed drills, and did not repair them when they were broken. The cooperative’s staff even said, “Since ancient times, one family has owned enough seed drills for a thousand families to use.” The Shenjiashan Cooperative valued a seed drill worth fifteen yuan at only nine yuan. In the Weizi Township South Street Cooperative, the fertilizer of middle peasant Chen Pangze was of good quality but was rated as second-class, at 0.25 yuan per cart; while the fertilizer of poor peasant Li Jianliang was of low quality but was rated as first-class, at 0.30 yuan per cart. There were also phenomena of harming the interests of middle peasants in issues such as land valuation and private draught animal rental prices.

Such investigations are very useful. They proved that in all cooperatives with such problems in their work, the middle-peasant members were ideologically unstable, production was passive, they no longer bought farm tools, nor did they take care of the farm tools; some even deliberately damaged the farm tools; they also did not take care of the draught animals, and sought to sell them whenever they had the opportunity. After the Luan County Committee took effective measures to correct these deviations and implement the policy of mutual benefit, the middle-peasant members' enthusiasm for production greatly increased, the relationship between poor and middle peasants became harmonious, and the consolidation of the cooperative improved a step further. Some middle peasants voluntarily invested in the cooperative to purchase draught animals and farm tools, and a new atmosphere of united production emerged.

Some rural workers lack a complete understanding of the Party's class policy in rural areas and lack a correct understanding of the essence of the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit in running cooperatives. They wanted to "take care" of the interests of the poor peasants, but they harmed the interests of the middle peasants. This, of course, made the middle peasants uneasy, production passive, and affected the unity of poor and middle peasants and the production of the cooperative. This not only harmed the interests of the middle peasants, but also harmed the interests of the poor peasants. These people only calculate small accounts and do not calculate large accounts, thinking they have done good deeds, but in reality they have done bad deeds.

The existing agricultural producers' cooperatives are economic alliances voluntarily formed by poor and middle peasants. We say that agricultural producers' cooperatives should be established on the basis of voluntariness of all members and mutual benefit of poor and middle peasants. If there is no mutual benefit, there can be no true voluntariness. If it is not voluntary, the cooperative will be difficult to consolidate. If the cooperative cannot be consolidated, it is of course a loss for the middle peasants, but the loss is even greater for the poor peasants. Because, in general, both poor and middle peasants need agricultural producers' cooperatives, and poor peasants need agricultural producers' cooperatives even more. This principle should be repeatedly explained to all rural workers.

The practice of the Luan County Committee is necessary. This kind of work should be done by all localities in the process of rectifying and consolidating agricultural cooperatives. Of course, we must not only correct the phenomenon of harming the interests of the middle peasants, but also correct the phenomenon of excluding the poor peasants and harming the interests of the poor peasants. We must comprehensively and correctly implement the Party's policy on agricultural collectivization.

    损害中农利益对贫农也是不利的
    仲夏
    中共山西潞安县委最近较全面、深入地检查了五个农业生产合作社执行农业合作化具体政策的情况，发现有些社在土地评产和耕畜、农具报酬等方面，损害了中农的利益。例如，北呈农业社租用中农社员的水车，两年来没有付租金。社里随便使用社员私有的九张耧，坏了也不修理，社的工作人员还说：“耧这种东西，自古以来就是一家置下千家用。”申家山社把价值十五元的耧只作价九元。微子镇南街社中农陈胖则的肥料质量好，被评为二等，每车二角五分；贫农李见良的肥料质量低，反被评为一等，每车三角。在土地评产和私有耕畜租价等问题上，也有损害中农利益的现象。
    这样的调查很有用处。它证明了凡是工作上有这类毛病的社，中农社员的思想就动荡不安，生产消极，不再置买农具，也不爱护农具，有的甚至故意破坏农具；他们对耕畜也不爱护，遇有机会就想出卖。在潞安县委采取有效措施，纠正这些偏向，贯彻互利政策以后，中农社员生产情绪大为提高，贫农中农关系融洽，社的巩固程度就提高了一步。有些中农自动向社投资，置买耕畜、农具，出现了团结生产的新气象。
    有些农村工作人员对党在农村的阶级政策缺乏完整的了解，对办社的自愿、互利原则的实质缺乏正确的认识。他们想“照顾”贫农的利益，但是却损害了中农的利益。这样，当然就弄得中农不安，生产消极，影响了中贫农的团结和社的生产。这不仅损害了中农的利益，而且损害了贫农的利益。这些人光算小账不算大账，自以为做了好事，实际上却是做了坏事。
    现有的农业合作社是贫农中农自愿结合的经济联盟。我们说，农业合作社应该建立在全体社员自愿、贫农中农互利的基础上。如果不能互利，就谈不上真正的自愿。如果不自愿，社就难以巩固。社巩固不住，对中农固然是损失，而损失更大的还是贫农。因为从总的方面来说，贫农中农都需要农业合作社，贫农更加需要农业合作社。这个道理，还应该反复地对所有农村工作人员讲清楚。
    潞安县委的做法是必要的。这种工作，在整顿巩固农业社的过程中，各地都是应该做的。当然，我们不仅要纠正损害中农利益的现象，同时也要纠正排斥贫农和损害贫农利益的现象。我们要全面地正确地执行党对于农业合作化的政策。
