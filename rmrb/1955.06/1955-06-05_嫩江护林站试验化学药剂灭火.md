    Nenjiang Aviation Forest Protection Headquarters of the Ministry of Forestry conducted eight ground chemical fire extinguishing tests in nearby weed and shrub areas in May. During the tests, backpack sprayers were used to spray a firebreak of two to three meters wide along the outer edge of the test area. Then, the fire was ignited according to the wind direction. When the flames, three to four feet high, spread to the firebreak, the fire automatically weakened and eventually extinguished completely. The test results proved that the use of chemical liquid agents is an effective method for coordinating with the masses on the ground to extinguish forest fires.
    Using chemical liquids to extinguish forest fires is an advanced Soviet experience. After a forest fire occurs, forest protection aircraft can carry fire extinguishing personnel equipped with backpacks or sprayers to the fire area. Spraying a firebreak of several meters in front of and on both sides of the fire can weaken and block the fire, and by coordinating with the mass effort of beating and burying with soil, the fire can be extinguished in time. If the aircraft discovers a newly started forest fire during patrol, it can drop chemical fire extinguishing bombs directly over the fire to extinguish it. (Our correspondent in Harbin)

    嫩江护林站试验化学药剂灭火
    林业部嫩江航空护林总站五月间在附近杂草区和小灌木区进行了八次地面化学灭火试验。试验时在试验地的外缘用背囊喷洒器喷射二至三公尺宽的隔火带，然后即按风向点火燃烧，三、四尺高的火焰蔓延至隔火带时，火势即自动减弱，最后完全熄灭。试验结果证明采用化学液剂是配合地面群众扑灭森林火灾的有效方法。
    用化学液体扑灭森林火灾是苏联的先进经验。当森林发生火灾后，护林飞机即可载送携带背囊或喷洒器的灭火队员到达火区，在火头的前方和两侧喷射数公尺的隔火带，即可把火势减弱和阻断，配合群众性的扑打土埋，可及时扑灭火灾。飞机在巡逻时如发现刚起的林火，可在火顶上空投下化学灭火弹直接灭火。　（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
