Promoting the Three-Tooth Lightweight Weeder
Zhao Qi

This year, the three-tooth lightweight weeder is being promoted in twenty-one provinces and one city, with a planned total of 62,000 units.

The three-tooth lightweight weeder is a new type of animal-powered inter-row cultivator, suitable for weeding and loosening soil for crops such as cotton, corn, sorghum, and millet.

This weeder has a lightweight body and requires less effort to operate, making it suitable for women and those with less strength. Because it can adjust depth and width, it is suitable for all types of soil, and its weeding efficiency is high with good quality. According to measurements, a single weeder operated by one person, pulled by one donkey, can weed twenty to thirty mu of land per day, which is five to nine times more efficient than one person using an old-fashioned hoe to weed three mu per day.

Although the method of using the three-tooth lightweight weeder is relatively simple, it is still necessary to teach the usage techniques to those who are using it for the first time. In the past, when the Nanyuan District of Beijing promoted this weeder, they did not pay attention to teaching the usage techniques, and some farmers mistakenly thought it was difficult to use. This year, when promoting this weeder, all regions should pay attention to doing a good job in teaching the technical aspects of its use.

Inter-row cultivation has a significant effect on preventing natural disasters such as drought and flood, and promoting growth and development for crops such as cotton and corn. This year, the number of newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives has generally increased, and they have a large task of increasing the production of grain, cotton, and other crops. In order to ensure the completion of the production increase task, agricultural producers' cooperatives and many farmers both have the potential and the need to purchase good inter-row cultivation tools. Therefore, the agricultural production leading departments and supply and marketing cooperative departments in all regions must earnestly meet this need and do a good job in promoting and supplying three-tooth lightweight weeders.

The agricultural leading departments and supply and marketing cooperative departments in some regions only pay attention to promoting the double-wheeled double-furrow plow and ignore the promotion of the three-tooth lightweight weeder. This is incorrect. Currently, it is the summer weeding season, and regions with the task of promoting and supplying three-tooth lightweight weeders should quickly do a good job in promotion, supply, and technical instruction, and give full play to the role of the three-tooth lightweight weeder in this year's summer weeding.

    推广三齿轻便耘锄
    赵起
    今年推广使用三齿轻便耘锄的地区有二十一个省和一个市，计划推广的总数是六万二千部。
    三齿轻便耘锄是新式畜力中耕农具的一种，适用于棉花、玉米、高粱、谷子等作物的锄草和松土。
    这种耘锄，锄身轻便，操作省力，妇女和较弱劳力都能掌握。由于它能调节深浅宽窄，各种土壤都能适用，锄地的效率高，质量好。据测定：一般一部耘锄由一个人操作，用一头驴牵引，每天能锄地二十亩到三十亩，比一个人用旧式锄每天锄地三亩的效率高五倍多到九倍。
    三齿轻便耘锄的使用方法虽然比较简单，但对初次使用的人还必须传授使用技术。过去北京市南苑区推广这种耘锄时，没有注意传授使用技术，有的农民就误认为它不好使用。今年各地在推广这种耘锄时，应注意作好技术传授工作。
    中耕对棉花、玉米等作物的防止旱、涝等自然灾害，促进生长发育都有显著的作用。今年新建的农业生产合作社普遍增多，它们的粮食、棉花等作物的增产任务很大。为了保证完成增产任务，农业生产合作社和许多农民既有可能也很需要购买好的中耕农具，那么，各地农业生产领导部门和供销合作部门，就必须认真满足这种需要，做好推广和供应三齿轻便耘锄的工作。
    有些地区的农业领导部门和供销合作部门，只重视推广双轮双铧犁的工作，不管推广三齿轻便耘锄，这是不对的。目前正是夏锄季节，有推广供应三齿轻便耘锄任务的地区，应迅速做好推广供应和技术传授工作，充分发挥三齿轻便耘锄在今年夏锄中的作用。
