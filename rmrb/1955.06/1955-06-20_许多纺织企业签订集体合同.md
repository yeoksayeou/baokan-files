According to incomplete statistics, thirty-three textile enterprises in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Qingdao, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi, have signed collective contracts this year. In the process of signing collective contracts, the broad masses of workers in the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory and the Harbin Flax Factory discussed the state plan, and some even exposed waste and lack of responsibility in production, and put forward suggestions for improving work. After discussion, the workers of Harbin Flax Factory proposed to increase the original total output value plan by 4.42%, to increase the first-class rate of bleached cloth from 97% to 99.3%, and to reduce the cost by 374,000 yuan compared with the original plan. In the process of discussing the collective contract, the workers of the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory put forward 367 suggestions on production, workers' welfare, and workers' education. The engineers' office of the state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory put forward 15 new technical organization measures.

Through the signing of collective contracts, the enthusiasm of the workers in these textile enterprises has been improved, and the internal potential of the enterprises has been further brought into play. After the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory signed a collective contract, dozens of groups set guarantee conditions and participated in labor emulation drives. In the competition, the leather roller workshop and the cotton cleaning workshop have improved the quality of their work. The state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory turned over 189,000 yuan more profit than planned in the first quarter. The living welfare of workers in many textile enterprises has also been improved. The meals for the workers of the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory now include more than 50 different dishes and 4 kinds of soup in a week.
