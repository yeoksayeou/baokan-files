Thoroughly Crush the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
    Duan Dezhang

    The third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, published by the "People's Daily," has fully confirmed that the Hu Feng clique is the most insidious and cunning enemy of our revolutionary cause. The Hu Feng clique has long been integrated with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, launching a joint attack on the Party and the people. After liberation, they hid on the mainland, using various despicable means to infiltrate our Party, government organs, cultural and educational institutions, and even our People's Liberation Army, to carry out their counter-revolutionary activities. These special agent elements, wearing the guise of Marxism and some having fraudulently obtained the title of "Communist Party member," carried out counter-revolutionary activities. They attempted to make our revolutionary cause of advancing towards socialism collapse and to enable the counter-revolutionary rulers, who were spurned by the Chinese people, to restore their rule in China. In this serious political struggle, all commanders and fighters of our navy must, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely and thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and eliminate these counter-revolutionary elements from the ranks of the people.

    All comrades in our units are particularly concerned about and cherish our country's transition to a beautiful socialist society. Because we know that today's and future happiness was obtained by all commanders and fighters together with the people of the whole country under the correct leadership of the Party through long-term sacrifices and bloody struggles. We used our lives to fight for it in the past, and today we will spare no effort to defend it with our lives. But these hidden counter-revolutionary elements want to destroy it. Their attack on the Party and the people not only has a set of "strategies" and "tactics," but also publishes a large number of their counter-revolutionary books and periodicals to slander, distort, and poison the people. Hu Feng's "Ode to Joy" is actually insulting Chairman Mao. And in his book "Together with New People," he maliciously attacked our navy through a distorted description of our navy's Zhao Xiao'an.

    This group of special agent elements has finally revealed their true colors in front of the people. But this incident also taught us that in the period of transition to socialism, the class struggle is even more acute. All comrades of our navy must raise their political vigilance, and any liberalism involving paralysis, relaxation, or leaking secrets may be exploited by hidden enemies. While we are working with the people of the whole country to crush the Hu Feng clique, we must also thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng elements who have infiltrated our navy and all similar Hu Feng elements who are hidden in our ranks!

    彻底打垮胡风反革命集团
    段德彰
    “人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，已完全证实了胡风集团是我们革命事业的最阴险、最狡猾的敌人。胡风集团同帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团很久就结成一体，向党、向人民举行联合进攻。解放后，他们隐藏在大陆，用各种卑鄙的手段混入我们党内，政府机关，文化教育机关以至我们人民解放军内部，进行他们的反革命勾当。这些个特务分子披着马克思主义外衣，有的骗得“共产党员”的称号，进行反革命活动，他们企图使我们向社会主义前进的革命事业垮台，而使被中国人民唾弃了的反革命统治者在中国复辟。在这个严重的政治斗争中，我们海军全体指战员，一定要和全国人民一起，坚决彻底打垮胡风反革命集团，把这些反革命分子从人民队伍中清除出去。
    我们部队的全体同志，对我们国家向着美好的社会主义过渡，特别关心，也特别珍惜。因为我们知道，今天和未来的幸福，是我们全体指战员同全国人民一道在党的正确领导下经过长期牺牲流血斗争得来的，我们过去用生命来争取它，今天又不惜用生命来捍卫它。但这些暗藏的反革命分子要来破坏它。他们向党向人民进攻，不但有一套“战略”、“战术”，而且还出版他们的大批的反革命书刊来污蔑、歪曲和毒害人民。胡风的“欢乐颂”，实际上在辱骂毛主席。而在他的“和新人物在一起”一书中，通过对我们海军赵孝庵的歪曲的描写，来恶意地攻击我们海军。
    这批特务分子，在人民面前终于露出了马脚。但这个事件也教训了我们，在过渡到社会主义的时期，阶级斗争更加尖锐。我们海军全体同志必须提高政治警惕性，任何麻痹、松懈、泄露秘密的自由主义都可能被暗藏的敌人所利用。我们在和全国人民一起打垮胡风集团的同时，也要把混入我海军内部的胡风分子和类似胡风分子的一切暗藏在我们队伍中的反革命分子，彻底清除出去！
