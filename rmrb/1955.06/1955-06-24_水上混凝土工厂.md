    Floating Concrete Factory
    Zhou Dai
    On the Hanchuan Highway Bridge construction site, there is a floating concrete factory. This floating concrete factory is located on a steel barge. At one end of the barge is a 1200-liter capacity mixer, and at the other end is a light, long-armed electric crane. In the middle is a material distribution platform more than ten meters high. With a light stretch of its long arm, the electric crane can send raw materials from the sand, gravel, and cement boats beside the steel barge to the material distribution platform for proportioning. The automatic tipper then sends the raw materials into the mixer. After the concrete is produced, it is sent to the shore or the bridge piers in the water by the electric crane for pouring.
    The floating concrete factory was built according to the suggestions of Soviet experts. Its advantages are: it is flexible and saves manpower, especially suitable for pouring underwater bridge pier projects. Wherever pouring is needed, the floating concrete factory is floated there. Many time-consuming and labor-intensive preparatory works before production (such as transporting and setting up machines) can be greatly reduced; most of the manual labor is also replaced by machines. Originally, when mixing concrete on land, the mixer needed to be moved frequently, and it could only produce for ten days a month. But with the floating concrete factory, concrete production is rarely interrupted. The total concrete volume of the Hanchuan Highway Bridge piers is one-third more than that of the Hanchuan Railway Bridge; because of the floating concrete factory, the working time is more than a month shorter than that of the Hanchuan Railway Bridge. When sealing the bottom of the No. 3 pier of the highway bridge, the amount of concrete was the same as that of the No. 5 pier of the Hanchuan Railway Bridge. When sealing the bottom of the No. 5 pier of the Hanchuan Railway Bridge, 600 people were employed. Due to the floating concrete factory, the No. 3 pier of the highway bridge adopted the "step-by-step pouring method," and despite the fact that the mixer capacity was reduced by one-third, the bottom sealing work only required more than 190 people.
    Soviet experts not only helped the workers here build this factory, but also enthusiastically helped the workers learn how to use it. On the first day of operation, a shift of eight hours only produced 15 cubic meters of concrete. Many people doubted whether this factory could really complete the huge concrete production task. At this time, Soviet expert Kalbinsky studied with the workers. He used a careful accounting method to point out that the factory had great potential, saying that the same factory in the Soviet Union can usually produce more than 100 cubic meters of concrete per shift. Therefore, he suggested temporarily stopping production and carrying out "training" work to allow workers to master the technology. During the "training," the workers who hung the buckets and the electric crane drivers quickly improved their technical proficiency, and then formally put into production. The workers also launched a competition in production, and production performance rose in a straight line, often breaking targets. When pouring the foundation of the No. 4 pier, Hao Guanghui's work team also created a new record of producing more than 120 cubic meters in eight hours.

    水上混凝土工厂
    周代
    在汉水公路桥工地上，有一座水上混凝土工厂。这座水上混凝土工厂设在一艘铁驳船上。船上的一端是一座容量一千二百公升的搅拌机，另一端是一座轻便的长臂电动吊车，中间是十多公尺高的配料台。电动吊车只要轻舒长臂，就可以把铁驳船旁的砂石和水泥船上的原料送到配料台去配和，自动翻斗再把原料送进搅拌机。混凝土生产出来以后，就用电动吊车送到岸上或水上桥墩上，进行浇灌。
    水上混凝土工厂是根据苏联专家的建议建造的。它的好处是：又灵便，又省人力，特别适宜于用在浇灌水上桥墩工程上。什么地方要浇灌，水上混凝土工厂就浮运到那里。生产前的许多费时间费劳力的准备工作（如搬运和架设机器等）可以大大减少；大部分的人力劳动，也都由机器来代替。原来在陆上搅拌混凝土，因为搅拌机需要经常搬动，每月只能生产十天，但有了水上混凝土工厂以后，混凝土生产就很少间断。汉水公路桥全部桥墩的混凝土工程量要比汉水铁桥多三分之一；因为有了水上混凝土工厂，工作时间反比汉水铁桥短一个多月。在公路桥三号桥墩封底时，混凝土工程量同汉水铁桥五号桥墩一样；汉水铁桥五号桥墩封底时用了六百人工作，公路桥的三号桥墩由于有了这座水上混凝土工厂，采用了“逐步灌注法”，尽管搅拌机容量少了三分之一，封底工作却只用了一百九十多人。
    苏联专家不仅帮助这里工人建立了这座工厂，而且热心地帮助工人学会使用它。开工生产的第一天，一个班八小时只生产了十五方混凝土。许多人都怀疑这个工厂是否真能完成庞大的混凝土生产任务。这时，苏联专家卡尔宾斯基和工人们在一起研究，他用算细账的办法，指出这个工厂有很大的潜在能力，他说，同样的工厂在苏联每班普通可生产混凝土一百方以上。因此，他建议暂时停止生产，进行“练兵”工作，让工人掌握技术。在“练兵”中，挂吊斗的工人和电动吊车司机很快地都提高了技术熟练程度，于是正式投入了生产。工人们在生产中又展开了竞赛，生产成绩直线上升，经常突破指标。郝光辉工班在浇灌四号桥墩基础部分时，还创造了八小时生产一百二十多方的新纪录。
