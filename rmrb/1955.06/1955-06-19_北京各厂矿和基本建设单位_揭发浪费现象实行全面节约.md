Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: Beijing's factories, mines, and basic construction sites are launching a comprehensive economy drive to accumulate construction funds for the nation.

Since April of this year, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has convened various meetings to mobilize state-owned and locally-owned factories and enterprises throughout the city to deeply engage in economy work. Following inspections and exposure of wasteful practices, many factories and mines have begun to formulate plans for increased production and economy. In discussing the national production plan, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant focused on uncovering waste and researching economy measures, drawing up a plan to increase production and economy by more than 8.6 million yuan for the entire year. The Liulihe Cement Plant plans to produce an additional 11,000 tons of cement for the country this year, increase profit contributions, and save more than 246,000 yuan in working capital. The Beijing Municipal Industrial Leadership Department organized similar factories under its jurisdiction, including heavy industry, building materials industry, and light industry, to conduct inter-factory inspections and, based on this, formulated economy measures. Many factory and mine youth workers have organized large numbers of youth economy teams to carry out voluntary labor to collect scrap iron and waste materials. According to statistics from eleven factories and mines, as of early June, more than 1,000 tons of scrap steel have been collected.

Beijing's basic construction units are re-examining the construction plans for various projects. As of June 17th, more than 119,000 square meters of auditoriums, office buildings, and dormitories, etc., have been reduced because they were deemed unnecessary or could be postponed, saving the state a total investment of more than 12 million yuan. Various projects scheduled to begin in the third quarter of this year have also decided to reduce project costs by 10 percent in terms of interior decoration and HVAC equipment, and in some cases by 40 percent. Nine design units in Beijing (including those under various ministries of the central government) have revised more than 40 engineering designs that blindly pursued architectural form and wasted funds, saving the country more than 7 million yuan. The three projects revised by the Urban Design Institute of the State Council's Urban Construction Bureau can save 1,150 tons of steel alone. More than one hundred construction sites under construction have also vigorously launched an anti-waste campaign, and the backlog and stagnant materials worth more than 5.8 million yuan revealed in the campaign are being actively processed.

The Beijing Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China recently mobilized a large number of staff to go deep into more than 120 construction units to conduct detailed reviews of engineering budgets and to negotiate revisions with relevant departments. In the engineering budgets of 47 units that have been reviewed and finalized, more than 3.17 million yuan has been reduced. The bank also cooperated with basic construction departments to investigate the inventory funds and equipment of more than 540 units, and found that more than 170 units had accumulated 63 million yuan in stagnant and usable funds and equipment. Relevant departments are now being actively urged to use and mutually adjust these resources.

    北京各厂矿和基本建设单位
    揭发浪费现象实行全面节约
    新华社十八日讯　北京各厂矿和基本建设工地正在开展全面节约工作，为国家积累建设资金。
    自今年四月以来，中共北京市委员会召开了各种会议，动员全市国营和地方国营厂矿企业深入开展节约工作。经过对于浪费现象的检查和揭发，目前许多厂矿已开始制定出增产节约计划。石景山钢铁厂在讨论国家生产计划中，着重揭发了浪费现象和研究出节约的措施，订出了全年增产节约八百六十多万元的计划。琉璃河水泥厂计划今年多给国家生产水泥一万一千吨，并增加上缴利润和节约流动资金二十四万六千多元。北京市地方工业领导部门组织所属重工业、建筑器材工业和轻工业等同类工厂，互相进行厂际检查，并在此基础上订出了节约措施。许多厂矿的青年职工组织了大批青年节约队，开展收集废铁废料的义务劳动。据十一个厂矿统计，到六月上旬止，已收集了废钢铁一千多吨。
    北京各基本建设单位正在重新审查各项工程的建设计划。到六月十七日止，有十一万九千多平方公尺的礼堂、办公楼和宿舍等工程项目因为不必要建设或可以缓建而加以削减，共计可为国家节省投资一千二百多万元。已准备在今年第三季度开工的各项工程，也都决定从内部装饰和水暖设备等方面降低工程造价百分之十，有的降低百分之四十。在北京市的九个设计单位（包括中央各部的）已经修改了四十多项盲目追求建筑形式而浪费资金的工程设计，可以为国家节约资金七百多万元。国务院城市建设总局城市设计院修改的三项工程，只是钢材一项就能节省一千一百五十吨。正在施工中的一百多个工地也大力展开了反浪费运动，在运动中揭发出来的价值五百八十多万元的积压和呆滞材料，正在积极处理。
    中国人民建设银行北京市分行最近动员大批工作人员深入一百二十多个建筑单位，对工程预算进行了细致的审查，并和有关部门协商修改。已审查定案的四十七个单位的工程预算中，就核减了三百一十七万多元。这个银行还配合基本建设部门，清查了五百四十多个单位的库存资金和器材情况，发现有一百七十多个单位积压能动用的资金、器材六千三百多万元。现在正积极督促有关部门动用和互相调剂。
