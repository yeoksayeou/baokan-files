Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 13th: Soong Ching-ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, inspected work in Songjiang Special District, Jiangsu Province, from the 6th to the 11th.

    The leading Party and government officials of Songjiang Special District first introduced the local work situation to Vice-Chairman Soong. Accompanied by local Party and government staff, Vice-Chairman Soong focused her inspection on the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songjiang County, where Chen Yongkang, a national model of high rice yield, was located. Vice-Chairman Soong held discussions with Chen Yongkang, director of the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative, cooperative cadres, as well as elderly, young, and female members. She inquired in detail about the organizational process and production situation of this agricultural cooperative, the ideological concerns of middle peasants when joining the agricultural cooperative, the handling of economic benefits within the cooperative, the promotion of new agricultural tools, how to assist surrounding new cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers, the role of the Communist Youth League members within the cooperative, the changes in the family status of women after participating in labor production, as well as the implementation of the unified purchase and sales and the "three fix" policies, the cultural learning and health care of farmers, and other aspects. She also solicited farmers' opinions and demands on the government. The cooperative members spoke very enthusiastically. They used concrete facts to illustrate the improvement in production and the increase in income after organizing the cooperative. The cooperative members were satisfied with the new agricultural tools supplied by the workers, expressed their intention to produce more grain and cash crops to support industrial construction, and hoped that the workers could supply them with tractors and more fertilizer as soon as possible.

    Vice-Chairman Soong also inspected the fields, canals, and sideline production of the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative.

    The inspection work did not stop even in the rain. Vice-Chairman Soong walked more than ten miles back and forth on muddy paths, visiting the families of Chen Yongkang and cooperative members Xue Xiulong and Fei Youcai. Before leaving, Vice-Chairman Soong said to the cooperative members: "I hope you will work hard to produce and strive for a better life, and set an example for the vast number of peasants to take the socialist road."

    Vice-Chairman Soong also inspected the relatively late-established and smaller-scale Lianmeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songjiang County, and talked with the cadres and members of this cooperative.

    After concluding her inspection work in Songjiang, Vice-Chairman Soong will continue her inspection in Shanghai and study the problems discovered during the inspection. (Attached picture)

    新华社上海十三日电　全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄于六日至十一日在江苏省松江专区视察工作。
    松江专区的党政负责人首先向宋副委员长介绍了当地的工作情况。在当地党政负责工作人员的陪同下，宋副委员长着重视察了全国水稻丰产模范陈永康所在的松江县联民农业生产合作社。宋副委员长同联民农业生产合作社主任陈永康、社干部以及老年、青年、妇女社员们进行了座谈，她详细了解了这个农业合作社的组织过程和生产情况，中农参加农业合作社时有何思想顾虑，社内经济利益的处理，新式农具的推广，如何帮助周围的新社、互助组和单干户，青年团员在社内的作用，妇女参加劳动生产后家庭地位的变化以及统购统销和“三定”政策执行的情况，农民的文化学习和卫生保健等方面的情况等，她还征求了农民对政府的意见和要求。社员们发言非常热烈。他们用具体事实说明组织社以后生产提高和收入增加的情况。社员们对工人供给他们新式农具感到满意，表示要生产更多的粮食和经济作物来支援工业建设，并希望工人能早日供给他们拖拉机和更多的肥田粉。
    宋副委员长还巡视了联民农业生产合作社的田地、水渠和副业生产。
    视察工作在雨天也没有停止。宋副委员长曾在泥泞的阡陌上来回步行十余里，访问了陈永康和社员薛秀龙、费友财的家庭。临行时，宋副委员长对社员们说：“希望你们努力生产，争取更美好的生活，为广大农民走社会主义的道路树立榜样。”
    宋副委员长还视察了成立较迟、规模较小的松江县联盟农业生产合作社，同这个社的干部及社员谈了话。
