Qian Da and Others Visit the Chinese Opera School and the Beijing Dance School

　　(From Our Newspaper) Qian Da, the head of the Indian cultural delegation, his wife, and some members of the delegation visited and toured the Chinese Opera School and the Beijing Dance School on the morning of the 16th.

　　The child actors of the Opera School were as if celebrating a festival today, wearing red and green silk skirts, waiting early at the school gate for the distinguished guests. Ever since welcoming the delegation at the airport, the children have been looking forward to seeing the distinguished guests again day and night, and today their wish was fulfilled. Mr. Qian Da was equally concerned about the children's work and study. As soon as he arrived at the school, he asked Principal Yan Yong many questions, such as: In addition to learning techniques, do students also study general courses? He asked about many small details.

　　The children performed basic physical training for the guests. When a child somersaulted ten times on the stage in one breath, the delegates were mesmerized. Especially when performing the basic movements of male and female instruments, the guests applauded enthusiastically after each performance. Some delegates nodded in praise while watching the female students' basic sleeve exercises. The delegates also liked the children's performance of "Stealing the Immortal Herb."

　　The principal, on behalf of all the teachers and students, presented the Indian cultural delegation with Peking Opera props such as swords and spears. Mr. Qian Da was very moved. He said: After returning to India, we will definitely send these noble gifts to the museum. Seeing them in the future will remind us of this pleasant visit to China. As he was getting into the car, he held the children's hands and said: I hope you will come to India.

　　After visiting the Chinese Opera School, the guests visited the Beijing Dance School.

　　When the cars carrying the guests arrived at the Dance School, groups of future dancers of New China, standing outside the school gate, welcomed the guests with enthusiastic applause.

　　Chen Jinqing, the vice-principal and dancer of the Dance School, warmly welcomed the guests into the school. She briefly introduced the history and teaching situation of this young dance school to the guests.

　　The guests watched the performance of basic movements by the young dance students. When a group of "little dancers" around the age of ten performed some basic ballet movements, they received enthusiastic praise from the guests. Then, the fifth-grade and sixth-grade students of this school successively performed the basic movements of Chinese classical dance and some movements of Chinese folk dance—Yangko dance. The guests greatly appreciated the pairs of young male and female students, gently shaking fans in their hands, dancing the Yangko. After the performance, Vice-Principal Chen Jinqing, on behalf of the Beijing Dance School, presented two sets of satin clothes with embroidered borders worn for performing the Chinese folk dance "Yangko Dance" to Qian Da, the head of the Indian cultural delegation.

　　When the guests finally bid farewell to this dance school, Chairman Qian Da wrote the following sentence in a signed autograph book: We spent a very pleasant and happy time in your beautiful dance school.

　　Finally, the guests took photos with the teachers of the Dance School as a souvenir.

　　When the guests were saying goodbye, a group of the youngest girls from the Dance School, wearing white dance costumes, ran out of the classroom and enthusiastically sent off the guests. The guests also said "Goodbye" affectionately in Chinese!

    钱达等访问中国戏曲学校和北京舞蹈学校
    本报讯　印度文化代表团团长钱达和夫人以及部分团员，十六日上午访问和参观了中国戏曲学校和北京舞蹈学校。
    戏曲学校的儿童演员今天就像过节一样，穿着红色的、绿色的绸裙，早早地就站在学校门口等候贵宾。自从在机场欢迎了代表团后，孩子们就日夜盼望着和贵宾再见一次面，今天他们的愿望达到了。钱达先生对孩子们的工作和学习问题也一样的关心。他一到了学校就问了校长晏甬很多问题，比如：学生除了学技术外，还学不学一般课程？等等许多细小的地方他都问到了。
    孩子们表演身体的基本训练给贵宾看。当孩子一口气在台上翻了十个筋斗时，代表们看得都着迷了。特别是表演男女器械基本动作时，每一个节目完了，贵宾们都热烈地鼓掌。有些代表一面看女生的水袖基本练习一面不住地点头称赞。孩子们演出的“盗仙草”，代表们也很喜爱。
    校长代表全校师生赠送印度文化代表团京剧道具宝剑、长矛等物。钱达先生很感动。他说：回印度后，我们一定把这些高贵的礼物送到博物馆去，以后看到它就会回忆起这次在中国的愉快访问。临上车的时候，他拉着孩子们的手说：希望你们到印度去。
    从中国戏曲学校访问出来后，贵宾们又访问了北京舞蹈学校。
    当载着贵宾们的汽车到达舞蹈学校的时候，伫立校门外的一群群新中国未来的舞蹈家们，以热情的掌声欢迎贵宾。
    舞蹈学校的副校长、舞蹈家陈锦清热情地把贵宾们迎进学校里。她向贵宾们简要地介绍了这个年青的舞蹈学校的历史和教学情况。
    贵宾们在这里观看了年青的舞蹈学生的基本动作的表演。当一群十岁左右的“小舞蹈家”表演着巴蕾舞的一些基本动作时，受到了贵宾们的热烈赞扬。接着，这个学校的五年级学生和六年级学生又相继表演了中国古典舞的基本动作和中国民间舞—秧歌舞的一些动作。贵宾们十分欣赏那一对对年青的男女学生，手里轻轻地摇动着扇子，扭着秧歌的舞姿。在表演结束后，陈锦清副校长代表北京舞蹈学校把两套表演中国民间舞蹈“秧歌舞”穿的镶边绣花的缎子衣服，赠送给印度文化代表团团长钱达。
    当贵宾们最后告别这座舞蹈学校时，钱达团长在一个签名留言的纪念册上写下了这样的一句话：在你们这个美丽的舞蹈学校里，我们度过了一段非常愉快和幸福的时刻。
    最后，贵宾们和舞蹈学校的教师们一起照像留做纪念。
    贵宾们告别时，舞蹈学校的一群最小的女孩子们穿着白色的舞衣，从课室里跑了出来，热情地欢送贵宾，贵宾们也用中国话亲切地说着“再见”！
