Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: The entire delegation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has returned to Beijing after visiting and surveying various locations in Northeast China as of June 17th. They visited numerous factories, mines, power stations, scientific research institutions, universities, and museums in Shenyang, Anshan, Harbin, Fushun, Dalian, Qiqihar, and other places. They surveyed the soil and coalfields of the Northeast region, held numerous symposiums with Chinese science and technology workers and production management cadres, and also gave academic reports. The entire delegation visited Lushunkou, laid wreaths at the Soviet Martyrs' Memorial Tower, and paid tribute to the historical sites of the Russo-Japanese War.

Academician Bardin, the head of the delegation, held a symposium with the scientific and technical personnel of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, introducing advanced experience in oxygen steelmaking. In Shenyang, he held two symposiums with researchers from the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and gave two reports to the Shenyang metallurgical community titled "How to Cultivate Metallurgical Engineers in Universities and Factories" and "On the Problem of Iron Smelting with Low Shaft Furnaces." On his way back to Beijing from Northeast China, he visited Tangshan Steel Plant and provided important suggestions on how to use oxygen in converters for steelmaking.

Academician Gerasimov surveyed the black soil, brown soil, and saline-alkali soil of the Northeast region. He held a symposium with researchers from the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shenyang, discussing issues such as the mapping of soil maps, the prevention of fertility reduction in black soil, and measures for fixing wind-blown sand in eastern Inner Mongolia. In Harbin, he delivered his observations on the soils of Northeast China to local agricultural and soil science workers.

Academician Kostenko held a symposium in Shenyang with scientific and technical personnel in the fields of electric power and electrical engineering, as well as teachers from Northeast Institute of Technology.

Academician Betechtin, after visiting many mines, answered many questions raised by Chinese science and technology personnel and put forward many valuable suggestions for China's underground resource exploration work.

Corresponding Academician Belousov surveyed the geological structure of the Taizi River and the coalfield geology of Fushun. In Shenyang, he discussed the geological structure of Northeast China with Chinese geologists and put forward opinions on the steps for drawing geological maps and the well-drilling problem of the Benxi coalfield.

Corresponding Academician Mishustin held a symposium with researchers from the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shenyang on issues related to soil microorganisms and gave a report titled "The Problem of Mycorrhizae of Woody Plants."

Corresponding Academician Tananayev visited the Chemical Industry Bureau Experimental Institute, Shenyang Smelting Plant, the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Petroleum Research Institute, as well as the Dalian Chemical Plant, Dalian Alkali Plant, and the Central Laboratory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. He offered opinions on the analytical chemistry work of these units and gave academic reports on physical and chemical analysis in Shenyang and Dalian.

Professor Voronin, Researcher Astafyev, and Researcher Cherkashen also held symposiums with Chinese science and technology personnel and production management cadres during their visits to various places in Northeast China.
