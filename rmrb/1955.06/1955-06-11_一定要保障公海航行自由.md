The nineteen crew members of the Polish merchant ship "President Gottwald," hijacked by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the Taiwan Strait in May 1954, regained their freedom last month and have returned to their homeland amidst the warm welcome of the Polish people. On their way home and after returning, the Polish crew members recounted the crimes of the Chiang gang, directed by the United States, in intercepting the Polish merchant ship and persecuting the Polish crew. During their year-long detention, the Chiang gang subjected the Polish crew to various forms of threats, enticements, and abuses. They attempted to force the Polish crew to abandon all thoughts of returning home and betray their country and people.

The Chiang gang's brutal behavior did not shake the Polish crew's staunch and unyielding spirit. These Polish crew members were loyal sons of the Polish people. The more rampant the persecution, the more courageous and steadfast their struggle became. Now, thanks to the persistent struggle of the Polish government and people, and with the support of righteous people everywhere, they have gloriously returned to their homes and reunited with their families. We are happy for them and extend our sincere condolences and respect.

Although some of the Polish crew members, who have been detained for as long as a year, have now been released, it is noted that some Polish crew members and the crew of the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" are still being held. Some of them have even been sent to the United States. Using the methods of robbery and detention of people from other countries to wage a Cold War is not the first time for the United States. These acts of plunder only allow people to see more clearly the true face of the American aggressor group.

The Chiang gang's crimes of hijacking merchant ships and undermining freedom of navigation on the high seas have always been inextricably linked to the United States. Under the direction of the United States, the Chiang gang's acts of infringing upon freedom of navigation on the high seas and undermining international shipping safety have intensified recently. On January 19th of this year, Chiang Kai-shek's aerial bandits bombed and sank the British merchant ship "Shengweijian." Many British and other foreign merchant ships sailing in the coastal areas of China have also continued to suffer constant attacks and harassment. Since May 6th, the Chiang gang has even laid mines around Taiwan and the coastal islands occupied by Chiang's troops, attempting to obstruct and intercept merchant ships from various countries coming to our country. Not only that, but the United States has also directly participated in this behavior that hinders freedom of navigation on the high seas in order to maintain tension in the Far East. This March, the U.S. government blatantly obstructed the Finnish oil tanker "Aruba" from coming to our country. The actions of the United States and the Chiang gang seriously threaten the freedom and safety of navigation on the high seas in the Far East and have harmed the legitimate interests of many countries. These actions have been condemned by fair public opinion in various countries. People from all countries, including many political figures, have demanded an immediate end to this behavior to ensure freedom of navigation on the high seas. Whoever insists on this behavior is intentionally antagonizing the wishes of good people.

### 一定要保障公海航行自由

    一定要保障公海航行自由
    一九五四年五月在台湾海峡被蒋介石匪帮劫持的波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德总统号”船员十九人，在上月重获自由，并已在波兰人民的热烈欢迎之下回到了祖国的怀抱。在回国途中和回国以后，波兰船员们曾控诉了蒋贼集团在美国指使下截扣波兰商船和迫害波兰船员的罪行。在被扣留的一年内，蒋贼集团对波兰船员们施行了各种各样的威胁利诱并加以百般的虐待。他们企图逼使波兰船员断绝一切回国的念头，背叛自己的祖国和人民。
    蒋贼集团的这种残暴行为丝毫不能动摇波兰船员坚贞不屈的精神。这些波兰船员们是波兰人民忠实的儿子。迫害越横暴，他们的斗争就越英勇、越坚强。现在，由于波兰政府和人民坚持不懈的斗争，由于正义人类的声援，他们光荣地回到了自己的家园和亲人们团聚在一起了。我们为他们高兴，对他们表示真诚的慰问和敬意。
    现在被扣留达一年之久的一部分波兰船员虽已获释，但是人们注意到，还有一部分波兰船员和苏联“图阿普斯号”油船上的船员仍然在被扣留中。他们中的一部分并且已经被送往美国。用强劫和扣留别国人民的方法来进行冷战，这在美国已经不是第一次。这种劫掠的行为只能使人们更加看清美国侵略集团的真面目。
    蒋贼集团劫扣商船，破坏公海航行自由的罪行，一向是和美国脱不了关联的。在美国的指使下，蒋贼集团侵犯公海航行自由，破坏国际航运安全的行为近来是变本加厉了。今年一月十九日，蒋介石的空中强盗炸沉了英国的商船“正伟健号”。不少航行在中国沿海一带的英国和其他各国的商船也继续遭到不断的攻击和骚扰。自五月六日起，蒋贼集团更在台湾四周和蒋贼军盘踞的沿海岛屿四周布下水雷，企图阻挠和拦截前来我国的各国商船。不仅如此，美国还直接参与了这种妨碍公海航行自由的行为，来保持远东局势的紧张。今年三月，美国政府曾以粗暴的方式公开阻挠芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”前来我国。美国和蒋贼集团的这种行动严重地威胁着远东公海航行的自由和安全，并使许多国家的正当利益受到了损害。这种行动已受到了各国公正舆论的谴责。包括许多政界人物在内的各国人士，都要求立即终止这种行为，以保障公海航行自由。谁要坚持这种行为，谁就是有意同善良人们的愿望为敌。
