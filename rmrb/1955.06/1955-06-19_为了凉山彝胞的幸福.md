To the Editor:

    Helping the Yi compatriots to build the Liutong River Bridge is an example of our troops stationed in Liangshan building a new Liangshan.

    The Liutong River is one of the larger rivers in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, traversing the Wagang and Zhonghe regions of Liangshan. The riverbed lies in the deep valleys and cliffs of the mountains, with a rapid current like a galloping wild horse. Before our troops entered this area, the local people had erected a bamboo cableway on the Liutong River between these precipitous cliffs. Because the cableway was prone to decay and breakage, countless Yi people were buried in the Liutong River.

    After we were stationed in this area, we decided to build a stone-piered, wooden-decked bridge over the Liutong River to ensure the safe passage of the Yi compatriots.

    Building the Liutong River Bridge was an extremely arduous task. The timber for building the bridge had to be felled at Baicaopo, more than 120 li away. This is a high mountain 3,800 meters above sea level, covered with snow all year round and with thin air. The whole mountain has only one 80-degree slate slope. Even when going up and down the mountain empty-handed, you have to wear straw sandals, grab the cracks in the rocks with both hands, and if you are not careful, you are in danger of falling off the cliff; not to mention dragging trees weighing hundreds of kilograms.

    Difficulties were placed before the comrades, but every squad and platoon of the Eighth Company resolutely requested to undertake this glorious and arduous task. In the end, the task was given to the Second Platoon and the carpentry squad.

    The day after they accepted the task, they bravely crossed the cableway and advanced towards Baicaopo. Along the way, the comrades marched with high spirits, climbing up the mountain. When thirsty, they grabbed snow and stuffed it into their mouths. However, the higher they climbed, the thinner the air became, and everyone began to breathe heavily. Huang Junzhong and Yao Xiangyun fainted from exhaustion, but when they woke up, they insisted on climbing upwards! Finally, they reached their destination. On the first day, they felled more than ten trees. The next day, the comrades brought four days of dry rations and lived on the mountain to fell trees. The mountain was shrouded in thick fog all day long, sometimes mixed with dense drizzle, and the rain and sweat soaked their clothes. When the dry rations were finished, they ate half-cooked rice when they were hungry. However, under such difficult conditions, not a single comrade complained, and they encouraged each other: "In order to relieve the suffering of the Yi compatriots, this little hardship is nothing!"

    Building the stone piers for the bridge foundation was also a very difficult project. When digging the middle pier of the bridge foundation, it was necessary to pump water out non-stop, because if you stopped even for a moment, water would immediately pour in from all directions. Therefore, the comrades of the Third Platoon, who were in charge of this task, not only pumped water during the day, but also lit gasoline lamps at night to continue pumping water, shift after shift! In three days and three nights of intense labor, there was almost no time to rest.

    When the Liutong River Bridge was successfully completed, the Yi compatriots living in the surrounding 30 to 40 li came to the bridge in an endless stream, as if celebrating the New Year, and they gazed at the soldiers affectionately with grateful and excited eyes. Old man Shi Jiao, an Yi elder, gave the soldiers a thumbs up and said:

   "If it weren't for your People's Liberation Army coming to help us Yi people build the bridge, I don't know how many more people would have drowned! Your People's Liberation Army is really an army that does good things for us Yi people! We must help the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the bandits hiding in Liangshan."

    For the happiness of the Yi people in Liangshan, we must build Liangshan more beautifully.

### 为了凉山彝胞的幸福

    为了凉山彝胞的幸福编辑同志：
    帮助彝族同胞修筑溜筒河大桥，是我们驻凉山部队建设新凉山的一个事例。
    溜筒河是凉山彝族自治州较大的河流之一，它横贯在凉山的瓦岗地区和中河地区之间。河床在群山的深谷绝壁之下，水流湍急，像一只奔腾的野马。当我们部队没有进入这个地区以前，当地人民在这悬崖绝壁的溜筒河上，架设了一条竹制的溜索。因为溜索容易腐朽折断，不知有多少彝胞葬身在溜筒河里。
    我们进驻这个地区以后，就决定在这条溜筒河上修建一座石墩木面的大桥，保证彝胞能够安全通行。
    修建溜筒河大桥是一项极其艰巨的任务。建筑桥梁用的木材，要到一百二十里以外的白草坡去采伐。这是一座拔海三千八百公尺的高山，上面终年积雪，空气稀薄。全山只有一条八十度的石板斜坡，就是空着手上下山的时候，脚上都得穿着脚码子，双手扒着石缝，稍不留神，就有摔下崖底去的危险；不用说还要拖着几百斤重的树木了。
    困难摆在同志们的面前，但八连的每一个班、排都坚决要求担任这个光荣而又艰巨的任务。最后，这个任务给了二排和木工班。
    他们接受任务的第二天，就勇敢地通过了溜索，向白草坡前进。一路上，同志们志气昂扬地走着，向山上爬着。渴了，顺手抓起雪来向嘴里就塞。但是，越向上爬，空气就越稀薄，大家发出了粗重的呼吸声。黄俊忠和姚相云累得昏倒了，苏醒过来，又坚持着向上爬！终于到达了目的地。第一天他们就砍伐了十来棵树。第二天，同志们就带上了四天的干粮，住在山上砍伐。山上，整天弥漫着大雾，时而夹杂着密密的细雨，雨水汗水把衣服浸得透湿。当干粮吃完的时候，饿了，他们就吃着煮不熟的大米。可是，在这样困难的条件下，没有一个同志叫苦，他们还互相鼓励着：“为了解除彝胞的痛苦，这点苦算不了什么！”
    修建桥基石墩也是十分艰巨的工程。在挖桥基中墩时，需要一分一秒钟也不停地向外抽水，因为稍一停，水就会立刻从四面涌上来。因此，担任这项任务的三排同志们，不但白天在抽水，晚上还点上汽灯继续抽水，一班又一班地抽，抽！在三天三夜的紧张劳动中，几乎连休息的时间也没有。
    当溜筒河大桥胜利完成的时候，住在三四十里路周围的彝胞像过年一样，络绎不绝地来到了桥上，他们用含着感激和兴奋的眼光亲切地注视着战士们。彝族老大爷石脚，伸出大拇指对战士们说：
  “要不是你们大军来帮我们彝家修桥，真不知还要淹死多少人哩！你们大军真是为我们彝家办好事的军队啊！我们一定要帮助大军清除隐藏在凉山的土匪。”
    为了凉山彝胞的幸福，我们一定要把凉山建设得更美丽。
