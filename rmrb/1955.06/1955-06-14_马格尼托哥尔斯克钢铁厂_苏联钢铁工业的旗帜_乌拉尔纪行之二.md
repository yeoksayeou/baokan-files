    Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works - The Banner of Soviet Steel Industry
    --A Trip to the Urals, Part Two
  　Our Correspondent in Moscow　Li He
    The Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Integrated Works is the banner of the Soviet steel industry.
    Magnitogorsk, meaning Magnetic Mountain City, is also simply called Magnitka by people. The city was established along with the steel factory named after Stalin during the First Five-Year Plan period. Standing on Magnetic Mountain, a majestic panoramic view of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Integrated Works and the city is presented before you. From the foot of the mountain, along the left bank of the Ural River, stretches an endless chain of factories. Under the billowing smoke reaching halfway to the sky, stand towering blast furnace complexes, with many open-hearth furnace workshops and other workshop chimneys arranged like a forest in the distance. Together with the factory, a densely populated city has grown on what was a desolate grassland just twenty-five years ago. Streets, squares, parks, gardens, residences, schools, cultural palaces, libraries... complement the factory's gaps.
    Magnitogorsk occupies a glorious page in the history of the Soviet Union's creation of its eastern industrial zone. As early as 1918, shortly after the victory of the October Revolution, Lenin proposed the ideal of creating a powerful coal mining and metallurgical base using the coal and iron ore deposits of the Urals and Siberia. According to his instructions, drafting began. But the strength at that time was not enough to solve this huge task. This ideal was realized during the First Five-Year Plan period under the leadership of Stalin. On March 10, 1929, the first tents of construction workers were set up at the foot of Magnetic Mountain; on May 15, 1931, Magnetic Mountain had already begun mining iron ore; on February 1, 1932, the first blast furnace had already begun producing pig iron. The establishment of the Magnitogorsk factory was the most important link in realizing the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to create a second coal mining and metallurgical industrial zone.
    The slopes of Magnetic Mountain are like a dozen neat terraces. The cross-sections of each terrace expose red soil and black earth. Huge electric shovels are working. Their buckets scoop up large chunks of ore and unload them into open cars pulled by electric locomotives. The electric cars shuttle across the terrace-like open-pit mine, carrying 360 tons of ore to the mountainside each time, automatically unloading them into crushers. The top of this mountain has already been cut off by a height of ten stories, which has been mined in more than twenty years. The head of the mine said: "If we continue to mine like this, the iron ore reserves will be enough for several generations!"
    The Magnetic Mountain open-pit mine is the first link in the mine workshop of the Magnitogorsk Integrated Works. From the mountain to the bottom, there are dozens of huge production sites and hundreds of large-scale equipment and new machines, from crushers and concentrators to machines with fully automated control of the entire sintering process. Walking between these machines and conveyor belts requires traveling ten kilometers. For many years, the workers of this mining site have always been champions in the mining sector of the steel industry competition. They supply high-quality ore to the Magnitogorsk Steel Plant, Kuznetsk Steel Plant, Chelyabinsk Steel Plant, Zlatoust Steel Plant, and other eastern industrial centers. They overproduced two million tons of ore above the plan in the first four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan.
    Down from Magnetic Mountain, passing through the mine workshop, one arrives at the blast furnace workshop. The sparkling sintered ore is sent by hot conveyor belts to the car, and transported to the hopper of the blast furnace. The blast furnace endlessly swallows the products of the mine workshop. The proximity of the mine workshop to the blast furnace workshop and its direct affiliation to the integrated works enable the blast furnace to obtain good quality sintered ore in a timely manner, thereby ensuring the balance of the blast furnace work and the improvement of productivity.
    The Magnitogorsk blast furnace workers, due to their courageous and creative improvement of technology, have become a model for blast furnace workers all over the Soviet Union to learn from. Various blast furnaces here have adopted new technologies such as neutralized iron ore, molten sintered ore, increased gas pressure under the furnace top, high heat and constant temperature blast, and smelting pig iron without manganese ore. In recent years, due to the adoption of these innovative technical operating procedures, the blast furnace workshop has increased the productivity of the blast furnace by 42 percent, and the pig iron output per worker has almost doubled. The consumption of coke has been greatly reduced.
    In explaining this achievement, I. Shagaidak, deputy director of the blast furnace workshop, said: "First, we do not give up in the face of difficulties and temporary failures. This shows the maturity of our cadres - their high level of technical expertise and persistence in achieving goals. Second, the blast furnace workers and sintered ore workers bravely opposed certain outdated theories in metallurgy, regardless of these theories." He believes that it is not right to demand immediate results from new technical operating procedures without giving them time for experimentation. It only benefits conservatives to hinder the implementation of new technologies in production.
    The advanced Magnitogorsk blast furnace workshop overproduced 498,000 tons of pig iron above the plan in the first four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and is now striving to overproduce more than 50,000 tons of pig iron above the plan in 1955.
    Leaving the blast furnace workshop, I arrived at the No. 3 open-hearth furnace workshop. The blazing flames of a long row of open-hearth furnaces, shining through the furnace doors, illuminated the workshop. Walking through this workshop is like walking through a street. In this open-hearth furnace workshop, a few new things attracted my attention. First, the actual steel output of the open-hearth furnaces here is twice the steel output originally designed for the open-hearth furnaces. This is because the capacity of the open-hearth furnaces has been doubled and the lifting capacity of the steel pouring cranes has been increased with a small amount of reconstruction, so the open-hearth furnaces can smelt twice the charge and produce twice the steel juice. Second, the open-hearth furnace arch here uses chrome-manganese bricks instead of silica bricks, thus greatly extending the working life of the furnace. Before repairing the open-hearth furnace, its metal skeleton is pre-repaired at the tapping port, and then installed with two cranes, thus shortening the repair period. Third, when the steel juice is cast into steel ingots here, the two braking pawls on the steel ladle are opened at the same time, and the steel juice is poured into two ingot molds from the double holes at the bottom of the bucket. This method of changing from a single pawl and single hole to a double pawl and double hole allows the ingot casting speed to match the steel tapping speed.
    Through these and other technical and organizational efforts, all the open-hearth furnace workshops in Magnitogorsk overproduced 126,000 tons of steel above the plan in the first four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and are striving to overproduce 60,000 tons of steel above the plan in 1955.
    From the open-hearth furnace workshop, I arrived at the primary rolling workshop. The steel ingots from removing the ingot molds, putting them into the heating furnace, sending them to the rolling mill, to rolling, are all automated. The steel ingots from the open-hearth furnace are increasing day by day, and the primary rolling workshop has to process them in a timely manner. It also has to supply steel billets to many other rolling workshops in a timely manner. In the past four years, the entire factory has rolled 132,000 tons of steel above the plan, and this year it will roll 25,000 tons of steel above the plan. These are inseparable from the work of the primary rolling workshop. This workshop is actively improving the productivity of the primary rolling mill. The workers have found potential possibilities in shortening the rolling time. They studied the time consumed by each operation from the heating furnace, calculated to the tenth of a second, and finally found a way to shorten the rolling time without affecting the quality of the steel billet. Now, carbon steel ingots are rolled into square steel billets after only 15 operations instead of 17, and rolled into plate-shaped steel billets after only 11 operations instead of 13. The edging procedure was eliminated when rolling square steel billets. Each item saves only a few seconds, but overall, the productivity of the primary rolling mill has been increased by an average of 3.5 percent.
    The many workshops of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Integrated Works cover an area of ​​tens of square kilometers. It has thousands of technical staff, almost doubled compared to seven years ago. Its labor productivity is rising in a straight line: 31.4 percent in 1954 compared to 1950, and another 4.4 percent in the first quarter of 1955. Here, in any workshop, you can meet many advanced workers and technicians who are full of creativity and innovative ideas, and who have solved and are solving many complex problems of improving the work of each workshop.
    However, advanced workers can only play a huge role when their innovative ideas can be adopted into production, and only when their valuable experience can be summarized and promoted to the collective. The Magnitogorsk Integrated Works is like this. In the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, the factory adopted more than 4,000 rationalization proposals, thus saving the country more than 30 million rubles. The factory's engineers, technicians, and foremen, with the direct participation of trade union workers, studied and summarized the experience of 374 advanced workers last year. In each workshop, people can see dozens of schools for disseminating advanced experience within the workshop, where advanced workers demonstrate and teach their experiences to people in the same profession at work positions. In addition, there are schools for exchanging advanced experience between workshops and between factories and other factories. The workshop holds meetings for exchanging experience, called "Tuesdays." Production innovators report their experience at the "Tuesday" meetings. Trade union organizations invite skilled technicians in advance to help innovators analyze their work and draw explanatory charts for the report.
    I lingered in Magnitogorsk for three days. When bidding farewell to it, it was at night. In the distance, the steel slag poured into the Ural River, like countless moving fireballs, rolled from the shore to the river in a series, reflecting a red glow in a corner of the sky. In the near distance, white fire flashes every time the blast furnace taps iron and the open-hearth furnace taps steel. So many blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, the continuous flashes of light illuminate the sky, revealing the night, and reproducing the majestic outline of the blast furnace complex and other chimney-lined workshops in front of people. On the No. 4 blast furnace, a red star composed of lights is shining, which is a sign that the production target of the workers of the No. 4 blast furnace ranks first in the entire workshop today.

    马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂——苏联钢铁工业的旗帜
    ——乌拉尔纪行之二
  　本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂，这是苏联钢铁工业的旗帜。
    马格尼托哥尔斯克，意思是磁山市，人们也把它简短地叫做马格尼卡。城市是随着以斯大林为名的钢铁工厂在第一个五年计划时期建立起来的。站在磁山上，马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂和城市的雄伟的全貌就显现在眼前。从山脚起，沿着乌拉尔河左岸，伸展着连绵不绝的工厂。在直达半空的滚滚浓烟下，耸立着庞大的高炉群体，较远处排列着许多平炉车间和其他车间的树林般的烟筒。和工厂一起，在这二十五年以前还是一片荒凉的草原上，生长了一座人烟稠密的城市。街道、广场、公园、花园、住宅、学校、文化宫、图书馆……补充了工厂的余隙。
    马格尼托哥尔斯克在苏联创立东部工业区的历史上占有辉煌的一页。还在一九一八年，十月革命胜利后不久，列宁就提出了用乌拉尔和西伯利亚的煤铁矿藏创立强大的采煤和冶金基地的理想。根据他的指示，开始拟订草案。但是当时的力量还不够解决这个巨大的任务。这个理想到了第一个五年计划时期，在斯大林领导下实现了。一九二九年三月十日，在磁山脚下搭起了建筑工人的第一个帐棚；一九三一年五月十五日，磁山已开始开采铁矿；一九三二年二月一日，第一号高炉已开始出生铁。马格尼托哥尔斯克工厂的建立，是实现苏联共产党中央委员会关于创立第二个采煤和冶金工业区这个决定的最重要环节。
    磁山的山坡像十几层整齐的梯田。在每层梯田的横切面裸露着红土和黑壤。巨大的电铲在工作。它们的掘斗铲起大块矿石，卸到电车头拖拉的敞车去。电车在梯田似的露天采矿场驰驶着，每次运载三百六十吨矿石到山腰，自动翻卸到碎矿机去。这个山头已经削去了有十层楼高的顶部，那是二十多年中开采掉的。矿山的负责人说：“照这样开采下去，蕴藏的铁矿还够几辈子用哩！”
    磁山露天采矿场是马格尼托哥尔斯克联合工厂的矿山车间的第一个环节。从山上到山下有几十个巨大的生产场所和几百个大型设备和新式机器，从碎矿机、选矿机到全部烧结过程自动化操纵的机器。在这些机器和输送带之间通过，要走十公里的路。这个采矿场的工人们许多年来在钢铁工业的采矿部门的竞赛中总是冠军。他们供给马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂、库兹涅茨克钢铁厂、车里雅宾斯克钢铁厂、兹那托乌斯特钢铁厂和其他东部的工业中心以上等的矿石。他们在第五个五年计划的头四年中超计划多生产了两百万吨矿石。
    下了磁山，经过矿山车间就到了高炉车间。火星闪耀的烧结矿由热气迫人的输送带送到车皮，运到高炉的料斗去。高炉无休止地吞进矿山车间的产品。矿山车间接近高炉车间并且直接属于联合工厂，这使高炉能够及时得到好质量的烧结矿，从而保证着高炉工作的均衡和生产率的提高。
    马格尼托哥尔斯克高炉工人由于勇敢地创造性地改进技术，成为苏联各地高炉工人学习的榜样。这里各号高炉采用了中和的铁矿石，熔化的烧结矿，炉顶下增高的瓦斯压力，高热和不变温度的鼓风，不用锰矿石冶炼生铁等等新技术。高炉车间在最近几年中由于采用这些革新的技术操作规程，把高炉的生产率提高了百分之四十二，每个工人的生铁产量增加了差不多一倍。焦炭的消耗量大大地减低了。
    在说明这种成就时，高炉车间副主任伊·沙盖达克说：“第一，我们在困难和暂时的失败面前不摆手。在这里表现了我们的干部的成熟——他们的高度的技术修养，实现目标的坚持性。第二，高炉工人和烧结矿工人不顾冶金学上某些已经陈旧的理论，勇敢地反对这些理论。”他认为：不给新的技术操作规程以试验的时间，而要求它立刻得出效果，这种见解是不对的。它只利于保守分子阻碍新技术在生产中的施行。
    先进的马格尼托哥尔斯克高炉车间在第五个五年计划的头四年中超计划多生产了四十九万八千吨生铁，现在争取在一九五五年再超计划多生产五万吨以上生铁。
    离开了高炉车间，我到了第三平炉车间。一长列平炉的熊熊火光，透过炉门，照亮着车间。走过这个车间好像走过一条大街。在这个平炉车间，几件新事物吸引了我的注意。第一，这里的平炉的实际产钢量，为平炉原来设计的产钢量的二倍。这是用少许改建的办法，加倍扩大了平炉的容量和提高了浇钢吊车的起重力，因而平炉能够冶炼双倍的炉料和出产双倍的钢汁。第二，这里的平炉炉拱用铬锰砖的代替矽砂砖的，因而大大延长了炉的工作期限。平炉在修理之前，它的金属骨架预先在出炉口修理好，然后用两台吊车安装，因而缩短了修理期限。第三，这里把钢汁浇铸钢锭时候，盛钢桶上的两个制动掣子同时打开，钢汁由桶底的双孔浇进两个铸锭罐中去。这种由单掣单孔改变为双掣双孔的方法，使铸锭的速度配合得上出钢的速度。
    经过这些以及其他技术和组织方面的努力，马格尼托哥尔斯克所有平炉车间在第五个五年计划的头四年中超计划多生产了十二万六千吨钢，争取在一九五五年再超计划多生产六万吨钢。
    从平炉车间我到了初轧车间。钢锭从脱开铸罐，放进加热炉，送到轧钢机，到压轧，都是自动化的。从平炉来的钢锭一天一天增加，初轧车间得及时处理它们。它也得及时把钢坯供应其他许多轧钢车间。过去四年，全工厂超计划多轧了十三万二千吨钢材，这一年还要超计划多轧二万五千吨钢材。这些都和初轧车间的工作分不开。这个车间在积极提高初轧机的生产率。工人们在缩短轧钢时间方面找到了潜在可能性。他们研究了从加热炉起的每个操作所消耗的时间，十分之一秒都计算了，最后找到了缩短轧钢时间而不影响钢坯质量的方法。现在炭素钢锭轧成方形钢坯只经过十五道操作而不必经过十七道，轧成板形钢坯只经过十一道而不必经过十三道。取消了轧方形钢坯时整边的手续。每项只节省几秒钟，但总起来平均提高了初轧机的生产率百分之三点五。
    马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂的许多车间合起来占地几十平方公里。它拥有几千技术工作人员，比七年以前，几乎增加了一倍。它的劳动生产率直线地上升着：一九五四年比一九五○年上升百分之三十一点四，一九五五年第一季又上升百分之四点四。这里，在任何车间，你都可以遇见许多先进的工人和技术人员，他们充满着创造精神和革新思想，他们解决了和解决着改进各车间工作的许多复杂问题。
    然而先进的工作者们只有当他们的革新的意见能够被采纳到生产中去，只有当他们的宝贵的经验能够被总结推广到集体中去的时候，才会起着巨大的作用。马格尼托哥尔斯克联合工厂就是如此。在五年计划的头四年中，工厂采纳了四千多项合理化建议，因而为国家节约了三千万卢布以上。工厂的工程师、技师、工长，在工会工作者的直接参加之下，去年研究和总结了三百七十四个先进工作者的经验。在各车间，人们可以看到几十个车间内的传播先进经验的学校，由先进工作者在工作位置上向同一专业的人们表演和传授自己的心得。此外，还有车间和车间之间、工厂和其他工厂之间交换先进经验的学校。车间里保存着交换经验的会议，叫做“星期二”。生产革新者在“星期二”会议上报告自己的经验。工会组织事先邀请熟练的技术人员帮助革新者分析自己的工作和绘制报告时用的说明图表等等。
    我在马格尼托哥尔斯克盘桓了三天。告别它的时候，正在夜间。远处，倾倒到乌拉尔河中去的钢铁渣滓，像无数运动不息的火球，连串地从岸上滚到河里，在天空的一角映出一片红霞。近处，每次高炉出铁和平炉出钢都闪起白的火光。高炉平炉这么多，起落接连的火光照亮天空，揭开夜幕，把高炉群体和其他烟突林立的车间的雄伟轮廓再现在人们眼前。在第四号高炉上，闪耀着灯光组成的红星，这是第四号高炉工人今天的生产指标在全车间占居第一位的标志。
