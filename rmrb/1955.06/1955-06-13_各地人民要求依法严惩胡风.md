    Beijing
    Units such as the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant, Xinhua Printing Factory, Beijing People's Machine Factory, Beijing Railway Bureau, and the Beijing Workers' Amateur Song and Dance Troupe held report meetings and forums, expressing extreme anger at the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. Li Shusen, a deputy to the National People's Congress and chief engineer of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, said: As a deputy to the National People's Congress, I request the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to revoke Hu Feng's qualification as a deputy to the National People's Congress in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, and severely punish Hu Feng and the chief culprits in his counter-revolutionary group. Many employees stated that they would raise their vigilance in the future to safeguard socialist construction. The Beijing branch of the China Democratic League convened a forum on the 10th with more than sixty members, and those present unanimously demanded that the government severely punish the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng and the Hu Feng group members who refused to confess. Teachers and students from Beijing University, Tsinghua University, and other schools expressed their anger, stating that they would thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.
    Tianjin
　　From the 9th to the 10th, more than 130,000 government workers and intellectuals in Tianjin listened to reports on denouncing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and launched discussions. After the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was published, people from all walks of life became even more enraged.

On the 11th, more than 60,000 government workers in the city held discussions. Many people unanimously expressed in their speeches that they would thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and pointed out that counter-revolutionaries like the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group must still be hidden in our revolutionary ranks. Therefore, on the one hand, we must eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, and on the other hand, we must expose all hidden counter-revolutionaries to prevent the enemy from sabotaging our revolutionary cause.
    Shanghai
    The people of Shanghai heard the "People's Daily" publication about the third batch of materials and editorials concerning the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group on the morning of the 10th via radio broadcast. Although the airmail edition of the "People's Daily" printed nearly 70,000 additional copies, it still couldn't meet the needs of the vast number of readers. On the 11th, newspapers in Shanghai reprinted this material, and the number of newspapers distributed increased by more than 140,000 copies compared to usual. On the 11th, Party organizations at all levels in Shanghai organized all staff members, intellectuals, and everyone with reading ability to read the newspaper, widely publicized it to the masses, and called on the people to raise their vigilance. Staff members of various government agencies, intellectuals, and the masses held conferences, discussions, and informal talks. Nearly 30,000 employees of state-owned commercial departments held separate discussions. The Shanghai Maritime Administration also sent telegrams to ships sailing overseas, organizing employees on the ships to hold discussions. The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Writers Association, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Musicians Association, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Artists Association, and the Shanghai Municipal Industrial, Construction, and Transportation Model Workers and Advanced Workers Representative Conference of 1954, which closed on the 11th, all issued statements, resolutions, and circular telegrams denouncing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng group. Local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai issued written statements and held meetings, denouncing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng group.
    Nanjing
    People from all walks of life in Nanjing gathered and angrily denounced the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. The Nanjing Federation of Trade Unions convened a conference of staff members of its own organization and affiliated cultural and educational institutions on the 11th to denounce the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. Wang Li, a member of the Nanjing Workers' Literary and Art Troupe, and Xu Yangshu, a cultural instructor at the Xiaguan Power Plant, used their own experiences to expose the poisoning of young literary and art workers by Hu Feng members such as Liu Xuewei and Ouyang Zhuang, as well as their anti-Party activities, slandering of leaders, slander of trade union organizations, sabotage of unity, and suppression of workers' enthusiasm for labor and creation. The conference unanimously demanded that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group members' criminal activities in all corners be further investigated, that all hidden counter-revolutionaries be eliminated, and that the hard-won victories of the working class and all the people be safeguarded. At a forum for all teachers at the Nanjing Industrial Accounting and Statistics School, teachers also used concrete facts to expose some of Hua Tian's counter-revolutionary crimes.
    Shenyang
    Workers in all workshops of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant held discussions. They angrily demanded that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group be severely suppressed.

Yu Heiding, Chairman of the Wuhan branch of the Chinese Writers Association, told reporters: The third batch of materials fully demonstrates the reactionary political background of the Hu Feng group. From these materials, it can be seen that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group constantly uses our weaknesses and complacency to attack us; therefore, we must raise our vigilance, strengthen our unity, and expose and eliminate all counter-revolutionaries. We must continue to get to the bottom of things; in Wuhan, in particular, we must investigate this bunker of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group in Wuhan.
    Guangzhou
    For two days, from morning to night, many organizations and groups in Guangzhou automatically gathered to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. People at the meetings expressed unparalleled hatred for the actions of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. The Guangdong Overseas Chinese Reception Center and the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Secondary Remedial School held a gathering of more than three thousand people. More than 1,500 staff members and cultural and artistic workers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou's army, navy, and air force held a gathering. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that when the War of Liberation was progressing victoriously, when our Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group expressed strong hatred for the victory of the Chinese people. This group is the mortal enemy of the people and must be severely punished according to law. Wang Shengbao, Kong Xianzong, and other deputies to the National People's Congress, as well as industrial model workers in Guangzhou, also went to the "Southern Daily" to deliver talks on denouncing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. They demanded severe punishment for these heinous counter-revolutionaries.
    Chongqing
    People from all walks of life in Chongqing angrily demanded severe punishment for the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. After hearing the content of the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group on the radio, many workshops, departments, and groups of the 601 Paper Mill held discussions. Yang Jiahuai, a model worker in the city's first-class industry and a female worker in a spinning mill, said: The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a loyal lackey of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. We demand that the government severely punish these counter-revolutionaries. The staff of the Chongqing Federation of Literary and Art Circles focused on discussing the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group" on the morning of the 11th. Everyone deeply felt that their past vigilance was not high enough, and that in the future they must intensify their study of Marxism-Leninism and the Party's literary and art policies, better overcome liberalism and individualism, raise revolutionary vigilance, and demand the resolute and thorough elimination of all hidden Hu Feng members.
    Xi'an
    On the afternoon of the 10th, when the newspapers carrying the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group were delivered to the venue of the ongoing Second Basic Work Conference of the Xi'an Municipal Trade Union, the conference immediately turned into a forum denouncing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the government severely punish the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. Workers from the weaving workshop of the Xi'an Dahua Textile Factory, the Xi'an No. 1 Power Plant, the Xi'an No. 1 Brick and Tile Factory, the Qinling Thermos Bottle Factory, and the Zhengzhou Railway Administration Engineering Office also demanded that Hu Feng and the main culprits of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group be punished according to law. At a forum held by the Xi'an Federation of Literary and Art Circles, many people also examined their own complacency and liberalism. Government agencies, schools, military units, and citizens in Xi'an held meetings to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.
    Hohhot
    On the 11th, the "Inner Mongolia Daily," which carried the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, sold more than 10,000 copies more than usual. Many government agencies, factories, and schools organized forums, and they unanimously demanded that this counter-revolutionary group, which has had close ties with the imperialist Kuomintang secret service agencies for a long time and has always hated the Party and the people, be promptly punished according to law. Literary, artistic, and educational workers in Hailar, a grassland city in eastern Inner Mongolia, also gathered on the 11th to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.
