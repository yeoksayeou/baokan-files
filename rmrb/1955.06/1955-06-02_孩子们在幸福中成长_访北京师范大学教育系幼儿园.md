    Children Growing Up in Happiness
    ——A Visit to the Kindergarten of the Education Department of Beijing Normal University
      By our reporter Bai Sheng
      Before “June 1st” Children’s Day, I had the opportunity to visit the Kindergarten of the Education Department of Beijing Normal University, located outside Hepingmen in the capital. This is an ordinary kindergarten, and also a practice site for the preschool education major of the Education Department of Beijing Normal University. This kindergarten was established in 1949, with only more than 20 children at that time, and has now grown to 113. Most of these children are the children of faculty and staff of Beijing Normal University, the oldest being seven years old and the youngest being three years old, divided into five classes according to age.
    When I walked into this kindergarten in the morning sun of May, groups of lively and lovely children were doing morning exercises in two large courtyards. In a courtyard with cypresses, parasol trees, flowers and plants near the entrance, a female educator was beating a tambourine, leading a group of three- and four-year-old children, walking around in a circle rhythmically. The children happily began a new day.
    Two young female educators led me to visit the children’s various assignments and activities. Each class in this kindergarten has an activity room and a bedroom. Some classes also have a washroom, and some have the washroom and activity room together. In each activity room, various teaching aids and children's toys are set up according to the needs of children of different ages. There is a piano or harmonium here, a set of children's tables and chairs, various large and small building blocks, and various dolls and doll-sized beds, small chairs, and small tables. Each activity room is also decorated with a "nature corner," which has a small glass fish pond with goldfish, tadpoles, and all kinds of beautiful shells; one or two light blue, yellow, or green budgerigars. This is a beautiful little bird that the children feed themselves; there are also hydrangeas with clusters of small red flowers and asparagus ferns, etc., which the children take care of themselves.
    When I visited the activity rooms of the middle and senior classes, both classes happened to be sitting at rows of small wooden tables, practicing drawing. The middle class children were drawing their most familiar budgerigars. The educator first demonstrated one on the blackboard, and then the children imitated it on a piece of white paper. Most of the budgerigars drawn by the children were very cute. A few children, probably because they had carefully observed the budgerigars on a daily basis, also drew branches on which the budgerigars perched and small bowls for feeding them, which were not on the blackboard. The senior class children were drawing portraits—a Young Pioneer. The Young Pioneers with red scarves drawn by the children were very spirited. The boys drew mostly male members, and the girls drew mostly female members in floral skirts.
    After finishing their assignments, the children were led by the educators to carry out various games in the courtyard. Some were playing on the slide, some were climbing the climbing frame, and some were playing the "train" game: they used various building blocks to build the locomotive, carriages, rails, and a station. Several children playing the roles of drivers, railway workers, and ticket collectors were busy doing their jobs, and some children were playing the role of passengers holding dolls and carrying things, preparing to get on the train.
    In another courtyard, the children were feeding pigeons, white rabbits, barred Plymouth Rock chickens, and white geese. The children all loved these animals very much. Some children came to the kindergarten early every morning and ran to see these animals first. Sometimes, when the noisy white goose laid an egg, the children would quickly pick it up and excitedly run to tell the educator: "Teacher, the white goose laid another egg! Look, how white it is! How big it is!" Leaning against the corner of the wall, separated by a low fence made of sorghum stalks, in a narrow piece of land, the children were planting pak choi, small radishes, and hyacinth beans. The hyacinth beans had already bloomed, and the pak choi and small radishes grew lush and green. This was a small vegetable garden that the children had opened up themselves.
    I watched the children eat lunch. They ate in the activity room. That day happened to be steamed buns, and the children were very happy. In the middle class, two small duty students helped the educator to put out the tableware and steamed buns, and asked the children to wash their hands before eating. At the dining table, the children were very well-behaved, quiet, and none of them were picky eaters. After the meal, each child ate half an apple. The children ate three meals a day in the kindergarten, and the daily diet was prepared according to certain nutritional needs.
    After the children woke up from their nap, the female educator and I walked into the children's bedroom. It was very tidy and well-ventilated. The rows of identical small beds were all covered with clean white sheets. The senior and middle class children folded their own quilts, and the educators helped the younger children to tidy up their beds. Next to the bedroom was the room where the children washed their hands and faces. Here, each child had a fixed place to put their towels, soap, and other items. Because the younger and middle class children did not recognize their names, pictures of cars, airplanes, kittens, and puppies were pasted on their fixed positions as their signs.
    This kindergarten has Soviet early childhood education experts providing guidance, and adopts a "comprehensive development" and "comprehensive cultivation" approach to education. The way to achieve this goal is: in the children's daily life, through gymnastics, games, environmental awareness, storytelling, drawing, handicrafts, music, calculation and other assignments and activities, to obtain development in all aspects such as physical education, moral education, intellectual education, and aesthetic education.
    The educators often lead the children to nearby parks in a planned way to play, cultivate the children's ability to recognize the natural environment and observe seasonal changes, and increase their knowledge. In the spring, the willows sprout green buds, the peach blossoms bloom, and the children see small fish by the river and hear birds singing in the trees, they will happily shout: "Spring is here!" Sometimes the educators also lead the children to visit post offices, train stations, cooperatives... so that the children understand how people live, work and labor.
    The kindergarten pays great attention to cultivating children's habits of loving labor and respecting working people. The children often have to carry toys in the game, and they very much hope to have a small car. One day, the teacher invited a carpenter uncle to the children, who brought a small car that was about to be made, and also brought a plane, saw, hammer, nails, and rough wooden boards. How can this small car be completely made? The children carefully watched the carpenter uncle plane and saw the rough wooden boards, and then nail the wooden boards to the small car. When the beautiful small car was made, how happy the children were! They loved this small car, and also loved the carpenter uncle. They learned from here what tools are needed to make a small car, and what kind of labor is needed.
    The kindergarten often guides children to carry out various creative and educational games, so that children can fully exert their wisdom, develop the spirit of mutual assistance and love, enhance their physical strength, develop habits of loving the collective and abiding by discipline, and agile movements and brave character.
    The kindergarten pays great attention to the individual education of children, especially those children who are not accustomed to collective life, have isolated personalities, or have relatively weak living abilities and physical strength, and pays special attention to cultivation and education. There was a five-year-old boy with a very strange temper. Since his parents divorced when he was young, he did not receive the warmth and love of his family. Later, his mother sent him to his grandmother's house to raise him, but his grandmother did not like him very much. Therefore, when he entered the kindergarten at the age of three, he was different from other children. He had no feelings for any adults or children, and always wanted to destroy things, even scolding the educators. In order to change this child, the educators took special care of him, loved him, and at the same time contacted his parents, so that the family could also care for him and pay attention to his education. When he showed some changes and progress, he was constantly encouraged. Slowly, he was not so disgusted with people, and his emotions seemed much more normal. He began to be willing to participate in various assignments and activities in the kindergarten. Now he is very accustomed to and loves the collective life of the kindergarten. Growing up in a happy environment, he is becoming more and more lively and lovely day by day.

    孩子们在幸福中成长
    ——访北京师范大学教育系幼儿园 　本报记者　柏生
      “六一”儿童节前，我有机会访问了首都和平门外的北京师范大学教育系幼儿园。这是一个普通的幼儿园，同时也是北京师范大学教育系学前教育专业的一个实习场所。这个幼儿园是在一九四九年建立起来的，当时只有二十多个儿童，现在已经发展到一百一十三个了。这些孩子大部都是北京师范大学教职员工的子女，最大的七岁，小的三岁，按年龄分为五个班。
    当我迎着五月的朝阳走进这个幼儿园的时候，一群群活泼可爱的孩子正在两个大院子里做早操。在一进园门的一个长着柏树、梧桐和花草的大院子里，一个女教养员敲着铃鼓，领着一群三四岁的孩子，绕着圆圈，有节奏地走着。孩子们快活地开始了新的一天的生活。
    两位年轻的女教养员领我参观了孩子们的各种作业和活动。这个幼儿园每班都有一间活动室和一间卧室。有的班还有一间盥洗室，有的是盥洗室和活动室在一起。每间活动室里，按照不同年龄儿童的需要，设置了各种教学用具和儿童玩具。这里有一架钢琴或风琴，有成套的儿童桌椅，有各种大型和小型的积木，有各种洋娃娃和娃娃用的小床、小椅子、小桌子。每个活动室里都布置有一个“自然角”，这里有玻璃的小鱼池，里面养着小金鱼、小蝌蚪和各种各样好看的贝壳；有一两只浅蓝色、黄色或绿色的虎皮鹦鹉。这是一种美丽的小鸟，孩子们亲自喂养它们；这里还有着孩子们亲自照料着的开着一团团小红花朵的洋绣球、四季常青的天冬草等花草。
    当我参观中班和大班孩子的活动室的时候，刚好两班孩子都正坐在一排排的小木桌旁边练习绘画作业。中班孩子在画他们最熟悉的小鹦鹉。教养员在黑板上首先示范地画出一只，然后孩子们便在一张白纸上模仿着画。大多数孩子画的小鹦鹉都很可爱。有几个孩子大概由于日常对小鹦鹉作过仔细的观察，还画出了黑板上没有的小鹦鹉栖息的树枝和喂食的小碗。大班的孩子画的是人物画——一个少年先锋队员。孩子们画的系着红领巾的少先队员挺神气。男孩画的多是男队员，女孩画的都是穿花裙子的女队员。
    上完作业课以后，孩子们便由教养员带领着在院里进行各种游戏，有的玩滑梯，有的爬攀登架，也有的玩“火车”游戏：他们用各种积木搭成火车头、车厢和铁轨，还有车站。几个扮演司机、铁路工人和剪票员的小朋友正在忙着做他们扮演的工作，还有的小朋友扮演抱着娃娃，提着东西，正忙着准备上火车的旅客。
    在另一个院里，孩子们喂养着小鸽，小白兔，芦花鸡，大白鹅。孩子们都非常喜爱这些动物。有些孩子每天大清早来到幼儿园，首先就跑去看这些动物。有时爱吵闹的大白鹅下了蛋，孩子们就赶紧把它拾起来，蹦着跳着跑去告诉教养员：“老师，大白鹅又下蛋啦！你看，多白呀！多大呀！”靠着墙角，隔着一道用高粱秸搭起来的矮篱笆，在一片狭长的土地上，孩子们种着小白菜、小萝卜和扁豆。扁豆已经开花，小白菜、小萝卜长得一片葱绿。这是孩子们自己开辟的一个小小菜园。
    我参观了孩子们进午餐。他们进餐就在活动室里。那天刚好吃包子，孩子们都很高兴。在中班里，两个小值日生一面帮着教养员把餐具和包子摆好，一面请小朋友们洗手进餐。在饭桌上，孩子们都很规矩，安静，没有一个挑食的。餐后，每个孩子吃半个苹果。孩子们每天在园中进食三次，每天的膳食都是按照一定的营养需要来调配的。
    孩子们午睡起来以后，我和女教养员走进了孩子们的卧室。这里布置得十分整洁，空气也很通畅。一排排式样相同的小床上，都铺着洁白的小床单。大班和中班的孩子们都是自己叠被子，小班孩子是由教养员帮着整理床铺。在临近卧室的旁边，是孩子们洗手洗脸的屋子。在这里，每个孩子都有一个固定的位置，放置着他们的毛巾、肥皂等物。小班和中班的孩子因为不认识自己的名字，在他们固定的位置上都贴着汽车、飞机、小猫和小狗等图片，做为他们的标志。
    这个幼儿园有苏联的幼儿教育专家在指导，在教育上采取着“全面发展”“全面培养”的方针。实现这个方针的办法是：在孩子们的日常生活中，通过体操、游戏、认识环境、讲故事、图画、手工、音乐、计算等作业和活动，获得体育、德育、智育、美育等各方面的发展。
    教养员时常有计划地带领孩子们到附近公园去游玩，培养孩子们认识自然环境和观察季节变化的能力，增进孩子们的知识。春天，柳树吐出了绿芽，桃花开了，孩子们在河边看到了小鱼，听见了鸟儿在树上的叫声，他们就会高兴地喊着：“春天来了！”有时教养员也领孩子们去参观邮局、车站、合作社……使孩子们了解人们在怎样生活，怎样工作和劳动。
    幼儿园很注意培养孩子们热爱劳动和尊重劳动人民的习惯。孩子们在游戏中经常要搬运玩具，他们很希望有一辆小车。一天，老师给孩子们请来了一位木匠叔叔，这位木匠叔叔给孩子们带来了一辆就要做好的小车，还带来了刨子、锯子、锤子、钉子和粗木板。这辆小车要怎样才能完全做好呢？孩子们仔细地看着木匠叔叔把粗木板刨光、锯短，又把这块木板钉到小车上。当漂亮的小车做成的时候，孩子们多么高兴呵！他们热爱这辆小车，也热爱木匠叔叔，他们从这里了解到要做一辆小车需要用些什么工具，需要怎样的劳动。
    幼儿园经常指导孩子们进行各种各样有创造性、有教育意义的游戏，使孩子们在游戏中充分发挥智慧，发挥互助友爱精神，增强体力、养成热爱集体、遵守纪律的习惯和敏捷的动作，勇敢的性格。
    幼儿园非常注意对儿童的个别教育，特别是对那些不习惯集体生活、个性孤僻、或生活能力和体力比较弱的孩子，格外注意培养和教育。有一个五岁的脾气非常怪的男孩，从小因为父母离婚，没有得到家庭的温暖和爱抚，后来母亲把他送到姥姥家去抚养，但姥姥也并不太喜欢他，因此他在三岁多进入幼儿园时，同其他孩子都不一样。他对任何大人和小孩都没有感情，总是想毁坏各种东西，甚至骂教养员。为了改变这个孩子，教养员特别关怀他，爱护他，同时和他的家长取得联系，让家庭也来关怀他，注意对他进行教育。当他稍稍有了一些转变和进步时，就不断鼓励他。慢慢地，他对人不那么反感了，感情显得正常多了，他开始乐意参加幼儿园的各种作业和活动了。现在他已经非常习惯和热爱幼儿园的集体生活。在幸福的环境里，他成长着，一天比一天活泼可爱。
