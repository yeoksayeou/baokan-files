Report at the Inaugural Meeting of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

Members of the Committee, Guests:

The Chinese Academy of Sciences is establishing academic divisions to divide and conquer the specific leadership of scientific work. After a year of preparation, it is now officially established. Under the current circumstances, we are setting up four academic divisions, namely the Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry, the Division of Biology and Earth Sciences, the Division of Technological Sciences, and the Division of Philosophy and Social Sciences. This is a major event in the development of China's scientific enterprise. From today onwards, 233 academic committee members, outstanding Chinese scientists, will participate in the leadership of China's scientific undertaking in a more organized way. These two hundred-plus academic committee members have achievements in scientific work and possess abundant specialized knowledge. Standing in the position of leadership, they can understand and study the various aspects of scientific work, propose valuable opinions, greatly strengthen the function of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and be able to cheerfully undertake the lofty tasks accepted in national construction. The members of each academic division will have many regular tasks to do in the future, but at this meeting, our main task is to study the work outline of the Chinese Academy of Sciences during the first Five-Year Plan period, and to study how to improve the work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to promote the development of the national scientific enterprise. I would now like to briefly report on the current situation of China's scientific work and put forward some suggestions for discussion by the members of the committee.

Our motherland is carrying out a great socialist construction, vigorously increasing industrial and agricultural production, realizing the socialist industrialization of the country, and promoting the modernization of national defense. In order to victoriously complete these tasks, we must fully utilize our country's natural resources and economic resources, continuously improve production technology, and thus must intensify scientific research work. At the same time, in the cause of socialist transformation, in cultural construction and ideological struggle, we must also carry out a series of painstaking scientific research work in order to victoriously complete the tasks. Experience has proven that due to the lack of sufficient scientific basis, much work has had to be carried out blindly, thus suffering losses. In recent years, the Party and the government have been concerned with the development of scientific work. In terms of the adjustment and enrichment of scientific research institutions, the improvement and guidance of research methods, and the improvement of the spiritual and material lives of scientific workers, the Party and the government have expressed deep concern and have often taken the necessary measures to enable scientific work to adapt to the urgent needs of national construction and give full play to its due role.

Although Chinese science has a long and glorious history, due to our country's long stagnation in the stage of feudal society, and even more due to imperialist aggression in the last hundred years, the foundation of our modern science is weak: the number of people is small, the level is not high enough, the development is unbalanced, and it cannot meet the needs of socialist construction. If we do not catch up quickly, after a few years, scientific work will still lag behind, which will have a very unfavorable impact on national construction. The world has entered the atomic energy era, and scientific knowledge is developing extremely rapidly. Under such a new situation, we cannot allow ourselves to stagnate.

Under the deep concern of the Party and the government, China's scientific undertakings have made considerable improvements since the founding of the country. First of all, scientific research institutions have been adjusted and enriched. Taking the Chinese Academy of Sciences as an example, we used great efforts at the beginning of our work to change the phenomena of overlapping institutions and dispersed manpower left over from the Kuomintang rule, and gradually established the necessary new research institutions. Up to now, the research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have increased by 1.4 times compared with 1950, and the number of researchers has increased by more than four times. In addition, the research units and researchers under the various departments of the government have also greatly developed. After the adjustment of departments in colleges and universities across the country at the beginning of the 1954 to 1955 academic year, scientific research work has been initially launched.

Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, after more than 30 years of struggle, the Chinese revolution has achieved a great victory. This great historical fact has educated the Chinese people and also educated Chinese scientists. The Chinese people and Chinese scientists are proud to have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great scientist and thinker Chairman Mao Zedong. Chinese scientists have accepted the lessons of the revolution, are sincerely grateful to and support the Party and the government, and are willing to study the ideology and methods of Marxism-Leninism. Since liberation, we have been following Chairman Mao's instructions to carry out self-education for ideological transformation. Especially between 1952 and 1953, Chinese scientists and the entire cultural and educational workers concentrated on studying Marxism-Leninism, making theory connect with practice, striving to transform themselves and improve their work.

As a result of the self-education movement, the ideological progress of Chinese scientists has been very significant. Political awareness has deepened, work enthusiasm has increased, and with the exception of a very small number of people, they are willing to closely cooperate with national construction and make achievements to serve the people. In 1952, in the struggle against the bacteriological warfare waged by American imperialism, many scientific workers went to the Korean front and worked selflessly with Korean scientific workers and achieved victory, which was an outstanding performance. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, in order to consolidate the border of the motherland and to improve the happy life of the Tibetan people, scientists trekked through high mountains and entered Tibet to conduct natural and social investigations and made some achievements, which is another outstanding performance. The vast majority of scientists have realized the importance of establishing a dialectical materialist worldview and are actively studying Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology for their scientific research. There are also many patriotic people among the scientists abroad who have risked their lives to return to the embrace of the motherland and contribute their knowledge to the construction of the motherland. We know that there are still some people trapped in the United States and Taiwan, who are feeling depressed because they cannot be freed freely. We hope that they can break through the blockade of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and return to the ranks of the people.

Scientific research institutions have undergone necessary adjustments and enrichment, and the thinking and research methods of scientists have also been significantly improved. Although the time spent on scientific research itself has not been ample in recent years, there have been more achievements in research compared with the years before liberation. Valuable scientific papers are constantly being published in academic journals and read at academic conferences, which are valued by the society. The number of types and sales of scientific journals and scientific works are unimaginable before liberation. In the field of natural science, there are new insights in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, earth science, etc., which are of great significance for further research work. Some research results have played an important role in national construction. The investigation and research of geology and minerals have increased the known reserves of important metal deposits such as iron, copper, and manganese, and coal mines, and have discovered new mineral seedlings. Metallurgical research has provided design data for the new iron and steel industry; the research on nodular cast iron and manganese-molybdenum alloy steel has provided good metal materials for the machinery industry. The research on weather forecasting has improved the accuracy of forecasting, which has made important contributions to national defense, transportation, agriculture, and water conservancy. Improved crop varieties have been selected and promoted, and methods for preventing and controlling the rice stem borer, locusts, and several major cotton pests have been found, which has increased the yield of cotton and grain. The comprehensive research on antibiotics, which is of great importance to the people's health, has also achieved important results. In addition, scientists are making unremitting efforts in the investigation and research of soil, plants, aquatic products, etc., the comprehensive investigation of South China and the Yellow River, and have achieved unprecedented achievements.

At the same time, we should not forget the leap-forward progress made in philosophy and social sciences. Marxism-Leninism is the guiding ideology for our national construction. In recent years, all sectors of the country have been carrying out the study of this central ideology, but what must be specially mentioned here is the unfolding of the criticism of reactionary ideas such as Hu Shi and Hu Feng since October last year. For this ideological struggle, many academic workers have published many papers and made many speeches in the past six months. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Writers Association have jointly held 32 academic seminars criticizing Hu Shi's ideas. This large-scale movement to criticize bourgeois idealist thought is continuing to be actively carried out and has achieved great results. Through the criticism of reactionary ideas, we have specifically learned and applied Marxism-Leninism. In particular, the exposure of the Hu Feng clique, which had been hiding in the revolutionary camp for more than 20 years and carrying out anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities, has further increased the vigilance of people from all walks of life and won another great victory in the ideological struggle. This has the effect of removing obstacles for the cause of socialist construction.

The achievement of many of our scientific research results is inseparable from learning from the advanced science of the Soviet Union. In the past few years, scientists have quite universally learned Russian, introduced the advanced scientific ideas and achievements of the Soviet Union, and translated a large number of Soviet scientific works, which has played a considerable role in improving China's scientific level.

The achievements of patriotic scientists in scientific research in recent years should be affirmed. There are many aspects of science, and the achievements are both large and small. I will not list them one by one here. Some of the more important achievements will be explained in more detail in the reports of the various academic divisions.

However, it is undeniable that compared with the needs of national construction, our achievements are still limited. Facts tell us: many important disciplines are not being studied by anyone at all; many important issues are not being touched by anyone at all; many of the research topics we have touched on are still relatively minor; and the integration of science and production and construction is not so close. Of course, we know that scientific research is a highly complex mental labor, and important research results cannot be obtained in a short period of time, often taking ten or eight years, or even more years. Therefore, on this level, we especially hope that the comrades who are responsible for actual construction in the industrial sector can have a deep understanding. In particular, for scientific results to be applied, it still requires the industrial sector and the research sector to make a joint effort to achieve it. But we scientists cannot use this as a self-deprecation. Our scientific team is indeed very small, the scientific foundation is indeed very weak, there are indeed many shortcomings in the working methods that should be corrected, and the scientific tasks are very arduous. We have no reason to allow complacency.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences is the central organization for organizing and leading scientific research, and of course cannot shirk the great responsibility that it should bear. In the past few years, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has undeniably done a lot of work and achieved some results in organizing scientists to serve national construction. However, there are indeed many shortcomings, especially in the leadership of the Academy.

We should admit that the most important shortcoming in the leadership of the Academy of Sciences is that it has not seriously studied the needs of national construction to formulate a scientific development plan; promote China's scientific undertakings. Our contact with various government departments is very insufficient, and we are not very clear about the requirements of various government departments for scientific research work. We are also not very clear about the current situation of the development of modern sciences and the potential strength of Chinese scientific workers. Until now, we have not put forward a long-term plan for scientific development. We have not been able to propose, according to the requirements of national construction, which scientific departments we should develop, which important topics we should study, and which research institutions we should establish. Which research institutions should be established first, which research institutions should be established later, where they should be located; how many research workers are needed, where these people come from, and how to train them; we have not seriously studied these issues. Until now, our cooperation with national construction has been mostly piecemeal and passive, and some of the most important research departments and research projects have been neglected. For example, the development of geological science is of decisive significance for industrial construction, but the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has not developed much in recent years. Of course, to do these tasks well, it is not without objective difficulties, but our subjective efforts are undoubtedly insufficient.

Fully developing the enthusiasm and creativity of scientists is an important task in the leadership work of the Academy of Sciences. The Party and the government have repeatedly instructed us that we must rely on scientists to do scientific work well and must correctly implement the policy of uniting scientists. However, it is precisely on this fundamental issue that our work is unsatisfactory. Although the work in this area has improved somewhat in the past two years, we have not organized scientists from various fields to conduct research well, and we have not studied and solved various problems in scientific work together with scientists. This has hindered the further development of the enthusiasm and creativity of scientists. Generally speaking, the scientific level of our country is relatively low, but it must also be seen that there are not a few outstanding scientists in our country, and the majority of scientists also have a considerable level, and are constantly improving. Therefore, as long as we can fully develop the enthusiasm of scientists, scientific work can make better achievements. We should believe in our own strength. In the past, our understanding of this issue was not clear enough, and the work of helping scientists politically and ideologically was not carried out enough, which could not but affect the achievements of scientific research.

Since the task of the Academy of Sciences is to organize and lead research work, in addition to doing a good job in general political and ideological leadership and doing a good job in administrative management, the Academy of Sciences must establish a strong academic leadership. In this area, we are especially dissatisfied. The comrades in the Academy of Sciences who are responsible for leadership work have not gone deep into the research institutes to understand the specific situation of research work, and have not conducted scientific research themselves. Therefore, we have almost always failed to put forward opinions and take necessary measures in a timely manner on the direction of the work of the various research institutes, important research topics, the organization of research forces, and the guiding ideology of research work. We have not organized and led academic seminars and scientific conferences well. Many of our responsible comrades are busy attending meetings, approving official documents, and handling daily administrative affairs, but do not pay enough attention to academic leadership.

Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue and must be changed. The main purpose of establishing academic divisions and concentrating the majority of outstanding scientists to divide and conquer the specific leadership of scientific research is here.

Members of the Committee, our national construction is already in the third year of the first Five-Year Plan. Based on our understanding of national construction and scientific research strength, we are preparing to focus on the following ten items as the key tasks of the Academy of Sciences during the first Five-Year Plan: (1) Research on the peaceful use of atomic energy; (2) Research in support of the construction of new steel bases; (3) Research on oil; (4) Research on earthquakes;
(5) Investigation and research in support of river basin planning and development; (6) Investigation and research on tropical plant resources in South China; (7) Research on China's natural zoning and economic zoning; (8) Research on antibiotics; (9) Research on various basic theoretical issues in China's national construction during the transition period;
(10) Research on modern and contemporary history of our country and modern and contemporary intellectual history. Most of these key tasks are already underway, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences should concentrate greater efforts to do them, and at the same time, it must organize scientific research forces from all over the country to jointly speed up the completion of the tasks.

Of course, during the first Five-Year Plan period, the scope of research work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should never be limited to the ten items mentioned above. Many other scientific works are very important and must be actively developed in a planned manner.

To solve a scientific problem that plays a significant role in national construction, it often requires many disciplines to combine and conduct comprehensive research. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this kind of work, and we must strengthen it in the future. For this reason, the Chinese Academy of Sciences will set up a Comprehensive Investigation Work Committee to be specifically responsible for comprehensive investigation work.

In connection with the above key tasks and the needs of future scientific development, we are preparing to focus on the development of Physics (especially nuclear physics), Chemistry (especially inorganic chemistry and analytical chemistry), Geology (especially the study of the genesis of ore deposits), Technical Sciences (especially the study of power and metallurgy) in the next few years, and take effective measures to accelerate the development of these disciplines. Marxist-Leninist philosophy and economics should also be vigorously developed.

There is still a very unreasonable phenomenon in the regional distribution of research institutions. Our research institutions are biased towards coastal areas and are concentrated in a few big cities. Many units are not matched with natural resources and economic resources. This unreasonable situation must also be changed. We are preparing to actively establish research institutions in the interior, so that the research institutions are close to the production bases, and promote the better development of scientific and cultural undertakings in the interior. This is especially necessary from the point of view of national defense. We are also preparing to gradually establish scientific research institutions in ethnic minority areas.

In carrying out scientific research work, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, strengthen the study of advanced Soviet science, and absorb everything of value in world science. In addition, we must cherish the scientific heritage of our motherland. Regarding these issues, there are still some very inappropriate views to this day. Some people think that studying Marxism-Leninism is of no use to the research of natural science, or that Soviet science is nothing great. Some people also think that the scientific achievements of capitalist countries should be completely discarded. These are all wrong views and should be corrected. The scientific heritage of the motherland that is worth cherishing and developing has been neglected for a long time, especially the Chinese medical knowledge that has made a major contribution to the health of the Chinese people for thousands of years is regarded as "feudal medicine" by some health workers, and deliberately eliminated. Although this very bad bourgeois erroneous thought has recently been exposed, it has not yet launched a full criticism. The extremely rich experience in our country's agricultural production and handicraft production has still not received due attention to this day. Such a serious mistake needs to be overcome urgently. We believe that researching and sorting out the scientific heritage of the motherland should be a major task of Chinese scientists at present.

In order to achieve the above tasks and improve future work, we put forward five suggestions for your discussion.

    I. Strengthen the planning of scientific work and study and formulate a long-term plan for the development of science in our country

Scientific work in our country must be carried out in a planned manner. The large-scale construction of the country is long-term, and the training of scientists and the harvest of scientific results also require a considerable long time. Generally speaking, it takes five to ten years for a hard-working university graduate to be trained as a scientist; a newly established research institution also needs to provide valuable scientific results after about five years. Therefore, the long-term plan for scientific development is especially important. Only with a long-term plan can we correctly arrange today's work.

In the past few years, the research work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has gradually developed in a planned direction, and some experience has been initially accumulated in planning work, but scientific planning work is still very backward and must be strengthened in the future.

When formulating plans, the close integration of theory and practice is a principle that must be followed. Neglecting this principle, not seriously considering the needs of national construction, and emphasizing personal interests should never be done at any time. But we must never think that the task of scientific work is limited to solving the problems at hand. Generally speaking, the main task of the Academy of Sciences should be to study basic scientific theories and solve key scientific problems that are of great significance to the national economy. The main task of the scientific research institutions of the production departments should be to solve the actual technical problems in production, and the research departments of universities should study basic scientific theories or scientific problems in actual production according to their specific conditions. We should formulate the long-term plan for the development of science in our country according to the principle of such division of labor.

    II. Give full play to the strength of scientists and actively cultivate new forces

In order to give full play to the strength of scientists, the responsibility of the Academy of Sciences and various scientific institutions must be to deeply care about the work and life of scientists. We should guarantee the necessary working conditions for scientists, guarantee their research time, and solve the various difficulties they encounter in their work. At the same time, we should also let scientists know that our country must concentrate its main strength to complete the main tasks. Therefore, there is a certain limit to the improvement of living standards and the improvement of working conditions; we must adhere to the principle of thrift, overcome various difficulties, and actively carry out scientific research. We should have an in-depth understanding of the expertise of each scientist and give them appropriate work arrangements according to their expertise and in combination with national needs. We should respect the specialized knowledge of scientists and their hard work. We should care about their progress politically and ideologically, help them study Marxism-Leninism, and overcome the idealist, liberalist, individualist, sectarian, and other erroneous thoughts that still exist among scientists.

Vigorously cultivating new forces for scientific research to strengthen the team of scientific workers is an important link in developing China's scientific undertakings and ensuring the progress of China's construction. This is also the glorious responsibility of all existing scientists. Scientific institutions and scientists must attach great importance to this work. Scientific institutions and universities should establish or improve the graduate student system and formulate methods for training and promotion for young scientific workers. The research results of young scientific workers must be valued, and various academic conferences should absorb young scientific workers as much as possible. The best graduates of universities should be allowed to engage in scientific research work as much as possible. In order to meet the needs of scientific development, students should be sent to the Soviet Union and other countries to study in a planned and large-scale manner. In order to achieve these tasks, we have drafted a "Provisional Regulations (Draft) for Graduate Students of the Chinese Academy of Sciences" and submitted it to this meeting for discussion. After revision, it will be submitted to the higher authorities for approval and implementation. In addition, the Academy of Sciences will also set up a Scientific Cadre Training Department to be specifically responsible for the work of cultivating new forces; without the responsible promotion of this work, it is unimaginable to hope that the scientific team will grow day by day.

    III. Establish a degree system, an academician system, and an academic award system

In order to establish academic standards and encourage the enthusiasm for engaging in scientific research work, we believe that the conditions for establishing a degree system are already ripe. We will jointly study the issue of the degree-granting law with the relevant departments and draft a draft within half a year, so that the state can formulate laws and grant degrees to scientists with a certain academic level and achievements in accordance with the law. The "Provisional Regulations (Draft) for Graduate Students of the Chinese Academy of Sciences" stipulates that junior degrees will be awarded to graduated graduate students and scientific workers who have passed the thesis defense review. This regulation can be implemented after it gains legal effect.

The Academy of Sciences is an organization of scientists. The best form of promoting scientific democracy is the academician system, that is, the system with the academician assembly as the highest organ of the Academy of Sciences. We will also draft laws on the academician system with relevant departments, and after approval, we will select the most outstanding scientists in our country as the first batch of academicians and submit them to the government for appointment. According to international advanced experience, the first batch of academicians is appointed by the state, and subsequent academicians will be elected by the academician assembly. After the establishment of the academician system, the Chinese Academy of Sciences will hold the first academician assembly to establish the leadership of the Academy of Sciences through elections. The convening of the academician assembly will further democratize the Academy of Sciences on the existing basis, so as to better lead the development of China's scientific undertakings.

Scientific achievements that are of great significance to scientific development and the national economy must be rewarded. We have drafted a "Provisional Regulations (Draft) for Scientific Awards of the Chinese Academy of Sciences". After this regulation gains legal effect, the Academy of Sciences will jointly study with the Ministry of Higher Education and relevant departments and issue the first batch of scientific awards within one year. In addition to the Scientific Awards of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, we also need to study various forms of scientific awards. There is no doubt that the implementation of the scientific award system will greatly encourage and promote the scientific workers in our country.

    IV. Strengthen international scientific cooperation

Strengthening creative scientific cooperation between countries is our urgent need and the common requirement of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. We must seriously practice this task. The fraternal countries of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are engaged in the construction of communism and socialism under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and must achieve close cooperation in the planning of some scientific work; many scientific problems must be carried out in coordinated research; various scientific conferences must send people to participate in each other; scientific books and materials must be exchanged and given to each other more. Especially on our part, we hope that more scientists from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries will participate in and help our research and construction work, and at the same time, we must constantly send more and more of our scientific workers to fraternal countries to study. In the past, we have not done enough in this area, and we must actively take various measures to strengthen it in the future.

We must also strengthen the ties and cooperation with scientists from other countries, especially Asian and African countries, exchange experiences, help each other, and work together to promote scientific progress and maintain world peace.

    V. Strengthen academic leadership

It is necessary for us to repeatedly say that the leadership of the Academy of Sciences must be improved, and the key to improving the leadership of the Academy of Sciences lies in strengthening academic leadership. The purpose of establishing four academic divisions today is also here. One of the important tasks of the academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is to formulate a long-term plan and current plan for the development of scientific work in accordance with the needs of national construction and the laws of scientific development, in accordance with the current situation in our country, to check the implementation of the plan, ensure the smooth implementation of the plan, and improve the plan in practice according to the development of the situation. At the same time, the academic divisions also have the responsibility to organize the scientific forces of the whole country, contact and adjust the work of various research units, avoid the phenomenon of duplication and omission in scientific work, fully utilize and develop the specialties of various units, concentrate the scattered forces to solve the important tasks of national construction.

The headquarters of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the academic divisions must also organize the study of Marxism-Leninism in a planned and guided manner, and take various appropriate ways to organize academic criticism and discussion. Promoting scientific democracy, carrying out academic criticism and discussion is the key to the development of advanced science. We must grasp this key to lead science. Bourgeois idealism is our enemy. Wherever any aspect of the work is eroded by bourgeois idealism, it cannot develop healthily. This is especially true in the field of science. We must thoroughly criticize bourgeois idealism and clear the obstacles on the road to scientific progress.

Now, on a national scale, a broad mass of cadres and intellectuals have launched a magnificent ideological struggle against the reactionary ideas and counter-revolutionary clique of Hu Feng. This is a major event in the political life of the new China. Chinese scientists should bravely participate in this struggle and recognize that a thorough ideological, political, and organizational defeat of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is necessary to guarantee the smooth progress of the Chinese socialist revolution. I want to emphasize that it would be completely wrong to say that there are no Hu Feng elements or Hu Feng-like elements in our scientific work system. It must be known that the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements is ubiquitous, especially because scientists are often immersed in specific tasks and often do not ask about politics. This weakness makes it easier for the Hu Feng clique and Hu Feng-like elements to take advantage of it. We must be vigilant, launch an anti-Hu Feng struggle in the scientific system to eliminate the enemy and purify ourselves.

In addition, important scientific theoretical issues in various scientific departments and practical issues of great significance to the national economy, this is the regular work of the Academy of Sciences and the academic divisions, and meetings must be held regularly for discussion. Various academic journals should also be actively responsible for organizing and leading academic criticism and discussion.

In addition to establishing academic divisions, the Chinese Academy of Sciences is also preparing to organize regional academic committees in some regions, and each research institute will also establish academic committees to organize outstanding scientists inside and outside the academy to lead the academic work of each region and research institute. Through the cooperation of the existing 233 academic committee members and the academic committee members who will participate in the various academic committees, the Academy of Sciences will undoubtedly greatly improve its ties with the national scientific community and industrial sectors.

Members of the Committee, please carefully discuss the work tasks and suggestions for improvement mentioned above. I hope that they can be revised and supplemented.

My report is coming to an end. Please allow me to remind everyone of your responsibilities again. Since scientific work occupies a very important position in national construction, the Party and the government have entrusted us with such a lofty task of leading academic work according to the requirements of the people. How can we be able to bear such a task? We have the responsibility to strengthen our scientific team and actively participate in the forefront of national construction. We have the responsibility to gradually improve Chinese science to the level of international advanced science, and be able to improve the material and cultural life of the entire human race. We must complete this responsibility, and we will definitely be able to complete it. We should have such confidence. As long as we can unite around the Party and Chairman Mao, study diligently, study seriously, work conscientiously, seek truth from facts, constantly improve, not exaggerate, not be discouraged, take care of the overall situation, and take care of the future, we will definitely be able to gradually contribute more and more in the construction of realizing socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, and enable Chinese science to receive its due development. In this way, we will also be able to guarantee world peace and human happiness.

The future of the motherland is infinitely bright, and the future of science is also infinitely bright.

Let us advance victoriously under the banner of Marxism-Leninism!

    在中国科学院学部成立大会上的报告
    中国科学院院长  郭沫若委员们、来宾们：
    中国科学院要设置学部，分工进行科学工作的具体领导，经过一年的筹备现在正式成立了。在目前的情况下，我们设置四个学部，即物理学数学化学部、生物学地学部、技术科学部和哲学社会科学部。这是我国科学事业发展中的一件大事。从今天起，二百三十三位学部委员，中国优秀的科学家，要更有组织地参加中国科学事业的领导工作了。这二百多位学部委员在科学工作中是有成就的，具有丰富的专门知识，站到领导工作的岗位上来，就可以了解和研究科学工作中各方面的问题，提出宝贵的意见，使得中国科学院的机能大大加强，能够胜任愉快地担负起在国家建设中所接受的崇高任务。各学部的委员们今后将有许多经常工作要做，而在这次会议上，我们的主要任务就是要来研究第一个五年计划期间中国科学院的工作纲要，研究如何改进中国科学院的工作以推动全国科学事业发展的办法。我现在想简略地报告一下当前我国科学工作的情况，提出一些意见，供各委员们讨论。
    我们祖国正在进行着伟大的社会主义建设，正以大力来提高工农业生产、实现国家的社会主义工业化，并促进国防的现代化。为了胜利地完成这些任务，必须充分地利用我国的自然资源和经济资源，必须不断地改进生产技术，因而也就必须加紧进行科学研究工作。同时，在社会主义改造事业中，在文化建设和思想斗争中，也一定要进行一系列刻苦的科学研究工作，才能胜利地完成任务。经验证明：由于缺乏充分的科学根据的原故，不少工作不得不带有盲目性，因而遭受到损失。几年来党和政府一直是关心着科学工作的发展的。在科学研究机构的调整和充实方面，在研究方法的改进和指导方面，在科学工作者的精神生活和物质生活的提高方面，党和政府都表示了深切的关怀，并且经常采取着必要的措施，使得科学工作能适应国家建设事业的迫切要求，发挥出应有的作用。
    中国科学尽管有长远的辉煌的历史，但由于我国长期停滞在封建社会的阶段，近百年来更由于帝国主义的侵略，我们的近代科学的基础是薄弱的：人数少，水平不够高，发展不平衡，不能适应社会主义建设的需要。如果我们不急起直追，到了若干年之后，科学工作仍然会落在后面，那对国家建设是会发生很不利的影响。世界已经进入了原子能时代，科学知识发展得异常迅速，在这样的新形势之下更不能容许我们停滞不进了。
    在党和政府的深切关怀下，中国的科学事业自建国以来有了不少的改进。首先是科学研究机构获得了调整和充实。拿中国科学院来说，我们在工作的开始便曾经用很大的力量来改变国民党统治时期遗留下来的机构重叠、人力分散等现象，并逐步建立了必要的新的研究机构。到目前为止，中国科学院研究单位比一九五○年增加一·四倍，研究人员增加四倍多。此外，政府各部门所属的研究单位和研究人员也有很大的发展。一九五四年到一九五五年学年初全国高等学校经过院系调整之后，科学研究工作已经初步展开了。
    在马克思列宁主义指导下，经过三十多年的斗争，中国革命取得了伟大的胜利。这个伟大的历史事实教育了中国人民，也教育了中国科学家。中国人民、中国科学家以有中国共产党和伟大的科学家和思想家毛泽东主席的领导而感到骄傲。中国科学家接受了革命的教训，是衷心感谢并拥护党和政府的，是愿意学习马克思列宁主义的思想和方法的。解放以来，我们一直在遵照毛主席的指示，进行着思想改造的自我教育。特别在一九五二年与一九五三年之交，中国科学家和整个文化教育工作者一道更集中地进行了马克思列宁主义的学习，使理论联系实际，努力改造自己并改进工作。
    经过自我教育运动的结果，中国科学家们在思想上的进步是很显著的。政治觉悟加深了，工作热情提高了，除掉极少数人外，都愿意和国家建设密切配合，做出成绩来为人民服务。一九五二年在反对美帝国主义进行细菌战的斗争中，许多科学工作者到朝鲜前线和朝鲜科学工作者一道进行了忘我的工作而获得胜利，是一突出的表现。西藏和平解放后，为了巩固祖国的边疆，为了增进藏族同胞的幸福生活，科学家们跋涉重山峻岭，进入西藏进行自然和社会的调查而有所创获，是又一突出的表现。绝大多数的科学家已经认识到建立辩证唯物主义世界观的重要意义，积极地学习马克思列宁主义，作为本门科学研究的指导思想。还有在国外的科学家也有不少的爱国人士冒着生命的危险回到祖国的怀抱，把他们的学识贡献给祖国的建设。我们知道在目前还有好些人陷在美国和台湾，正以不能自由解脱而感到苦闷，我们希望他们能够冲破美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的封锁，回到人民的队伍里来。
    科学研究机构经过必要的调整和充实，科学家的思想和研究方法也有了显著的改进，几年来尽管用在科学研究工作本身上的时间并不充裕，然而在研究成绩上比较解放前的年代却有了更多的收获。有价值的科学论文不断地在学术刊物上发表，在学术会议上宣读，受到社会的重视。科学刊物和科学论著的出版，其种类和销售数量之多都是在解放前所不能梦想的。在自然科学方面，数学、物理学、化学、生物学、地学等领域中都有新的创见，对于进一步的研究工作具有重大的意义。还有一部分研究成果在国家建设中已经发生了重要作用。地质矿产的调查和研究，提高了对铁、铜、锰等重要金属矿藏和煤矿的已知储量，并发现了新的矿苗。冶金的研究对新的钢铁工业提供了设计数据；球墨铸铁和锰钼合金钢的研究对机械工业提供了良好的金属材料。天气预报的研究，提高了预报的准确度，对于国防、交通、农业、水利等有了重要的贡献。选育并推广了优良作物品种，找出了对螟虫、蝗虫和几种主要棉虫的防治方法，提高了棉粮的产量。对人民保健事业有重要关系的抗生素的综合研究也取得了重要的成绩。此外，关于土壤、植物、水产等方面的调查研究，华南和黄河的综合考察，科学家们都在进行着不懈的努力，同样有着前所未有的成就。
    同时，我们不应该忘记在哲学和社会科学方面所表现的飞跃的进展。马克思列宁主义是我们国家建设的领导思想，几年来全国各界都在进行着这项中心思想的学习，但在这里必须特别提到的是从去年十月开始的对胡适、胡风等反动思想批判的展开。对于这一思想斗争，半年多来，许多学术工作者发表了不少的论文，进行了不少次的讲演。中国科学院和作家协会已经联合举办过三十二次的批判胡适思想的学术讨论会。这一规模宏大的批判资产阶级唯心主义思想的运动，目前正继续积极开展中，已经收到了很大的效果。通过对反动思想的批判，我们具体地学习和运用了马克思列宁主义。特别是揭发了二十多年来潜藏在革命阵营里面进行反党、反人民、反革命的胡风集团，更提高了各界人民的警惕性，在思想斗争上又获得了一次伟大的胜利。这对于社会主义建设事业是有清除障碍的作用的。
    我们许多科学研究成绩的获得是和学习苏联先进科学分不开的。在过去几年中，科学家们相当普遍地学会了俄文，介绍了苏联先进科学思想和成就，翻译了大量的苏联科学著作，对提高我国科学水平起了相当大的作用。
    几年来爱国的科学家们在科学研究上的成就是应该肯定的，科学的方面多，成绩也有大有小，我在这里不准备一一列举了。有一些比较重要的成就在各学部的报告里面是会有更详细的说明的。
    然而无可讳言，同国家建设的需要比较起来，我们的成就依然是有限的。事实告诉我们：许多重要的学科，我们还根本没有人研究；好些重要的问题，我们也根本没有人接触；我们所接触到的研究题目有好些还是比较次要的；科学和生产建设的结合也还不那么紧密。当然，我们知道，科学研究是高度复杂的脑力劳动，重要的研究成果不是短时期内可以得到的，往往要费十年八年，或甚至更多的年月。因此，关于这一层，我们要特别希望在产业部门担负实际建设的同志们能有深切的谅解。特别是科学成果要见诸应用，那还需要产业部门和研究部门作一番共同努力才能办到。但我们科学家们也不能够借此以作自我解嘲。我们的科学队伍确实还很小，科学基础确实还很薄弱，工作方法中应该改正的缺点确实还很多，而科学任务却又十分艰巨，我们是没有丝毫理由可以允许自满的。
    中国科学院是组织并领导科学研究的中心机构，当然不能推卸掉自己所应该担负的很大的责任。中国科学院几年来在组织科学家为国家建设服务方面，不能否认，是作了不少工作，也取得了一些成绩。但是所存在着的缺点确是很多，特别在院的领导工作方面。
    我们应该承认：科学院领导工作中最主要的一个缺点，就是没有认真研究国家建设的需要，来制定科学发展计划；推进我国科学事业。我们和政府各部门的联系是很不够的，政府各部门对于科学研究工作的要求我们不很清楚。近代各门科学发展的现状和我国科学工作者的潜在力量，我们也不很清楚。直到现在，我们还没有提出过一个科学发展的远景计划。我们没有能够根据国家建设的要求，提出我们应该发展哪些科学部门，研究哪些重要题目，建立哪些研究机构。哪些研究机构先设，哪些研究机构后设，应该设在什么地方；研究工作人员需要多少、这些人从哪里来，怎样培养；这些问题我们并不曾加以认真的研究。直到现在，我们对国家建设的配合多半是零碎的、被动的，有些最重要的研究部门和研究项目反而被忽视了。例如地质科学的发展对于工业建设具有决定意义，可是这几年来中国科学院地质研究所却没有什么发展。当然要做好这些工作，不是没有客观困难的，但我们的主观努力不够是毫无疑问的。
    充分发挥科学家的积极性和创造性，是科学院领导工作中一个重要的任务。党和政府一再指示我们必须依靠科学家来做好科学工作，必须正确地执行团结科学家的政策。可是，正是在这个根本问题上，我们的工作是不能令人满意的。近两年来这方面的工作虽然有所改进，但是我们毕竟没有很好地组织各方面的科学家们进行研究，没有很好地和科学家们在一起研究并解决科学工作中的各种问题。这就妨碍了科学家积极性和创造性进一步的发挥。我国的科学水平，一般说来，是比较低的，但也必须看到，我国优秀的科学家并不在少数，有多数的科学家也具有相当的水平，而且也在不断的提高当中。因此，只要能够充分发挥科学家的积极性，科学工作是可以作出更好的成绩的。我们应该相信自己的力量。对这个问题过去我们的认识不够明确，而对科学家进行政治上、思想上的帮助工作，也进行得不够，这就不能不影响到科学研究的成就。
    科学院的任务既是组织和领导研究工作，除了要做好一般的政治思想领导和做好行政管理工作外，科学院就必须树立坚强的学术领导。在这方面的工作，我们尤其是不能令人满意的。科学院担负领导工作的同志，没有深入到研究所里去了解研究工作的具体情况，自己没有进行科学研究。因此，对各研究所工作的方向、重要研究题目、研究力量的组织、研究工作的指导思想，我们差不多常常是没有能够及时地提出意见，采取必要的措施。我们也没有很好地组织和领导学术讨论会和科学会议。我们许多负责同志，忙于开会、批公文和处理日常行政事务，而对于学术领导却注意得不够。
    这样的情况是不能允许继续存在的，必须加以改变。我们所以要成立学部，集中多数优秀的科学家来分工进行科学研究的具体领导，其主要目的也就在这里。
    各位委员，我们的国家建设事业已经进展到第一个五年计划的第三年度了。根据我们对国家建设和科学研究力量的了解，在第一个五年计划期间，准备以下列十项作为科学院的重点工作：（一）原子能和平利用的研究；（二）配合新钢铁基地的建设的研究；（三）石油的研究；（四）地震的研究；
  （五）配合流域规划与开发的调查研究；（六）华南热带植物资源的调查研究；（七）中国自然区划和经济区划的研究；（八）抗生素的研究；（九）我国过渡时期国家建设中的各种基本理论问题的研究；
  （十）我国近代、现代史和近代、现代思想史的研究。这些重点工作大部分已经在进行当中，中国科学院应该集中更大的力量来做，同时还必须组织全国各方面的科学研究力量共同加紧完成任务。
    当然，在第一个五年计划期间，中国科学院研究工作的范围，决不应该局限于上面提出的十项工作，许多其他科学工作都是非常重要的，都必须有计划地积极地来发展。
    要解决一个对国家建设起重大作用的科学问题，往往需要许多学科结合起来进行综合性的研究。以往我们对于这种工作不够重视，今后必须予以加强。为此，中国科学院要设置一个综合考察工作委员会来专门负责综合性的考察工作。
    结合上述重点工作和今后科学发展的需要，我们准备以物理学（特别是原子核物理学），化学
  （特别是无机化学和分析化学），地质学（特别是矿床成因的研究），技术科学（特别是动力和冶金学的研究）为最近几年内发展的重点，采取有效的措施来加速这些学科的发展。马克思列宁主义的哲学和经济学也应该大力发展。
    研究机构的地区分布方面还存在着很不合理的现象。我们的研究机构偏于沿海地区，并且集中在少数几个大城市里面，好些单位是和自然资源和经济资源不相配合的。这种不合理的状况也必须加以改变。我们准备积极地在内地建立研究机构，使研究机构接近生产基地，促使内地科学文化事业得以更好的发展。从国防观点来考虑是尤其应该这样的。在少数民族地区我们也准备逐渐设立科学研究机构。
    在进行科学研究工作中我们必须加强马克思列宁主义的学习，加强苏联先进科学的学习并吸取世界科学中一切有价值的东西。此外，我们还必须珍视祖国科学遗产。关于这些问题，遗憾的是至今还有一些很不妥当的看法。有的人认为学习马克思列宁主义对自然科学的研究没有什么用处，或者说苏联科学并没有什么了不起。也有的人认为资本主义国家的科学成就应该根本抛弃。这些都是错误的见解，是应该加以改正的。祖国许多值得珍重和发扬的科学遗产更是长期被忽视，特别是几千年来对中国人民的健康有重大贡献的中国医药知识被一部分卫生工作人员视为“封建医”，而蓄意加以消灭，这种十分恶劣的资产阶级错误思想最近虽被揭发，但还没有展开充分的批判。我国的农业生产和手工业生产中极其丰富的经验直到今天也依然没有受到应有的重视。这样的严重错误是急需克服的。我们认为，研究并整理祖国科学遗产应该是我国科学家当前的一项重大任务。
    为了实现上述任务，改进今后工作，我们提出五点建议，请大家讨论。
      一、加强科学工作的计划性、研究并制定我国科学发展的远景计划
    我国科学工作必须有计划地进行。国家大规模的建设事业是长远的，科学家的培养和科学成果的收获也都需要相当长远的时间。一般说来，由一位刻苦努力的大学毕业生培养成为科学家，需要五年到十年的岁月；一个新成立的研究机构，也要经过大约五年的时间才能提供有价值的科学成果。因此，科学发展的远景计划就尤其重要。只有有了远景计划，才能够正确地安排今天的工作。
    几年来，中国科学院的研究工作是逐步向有计划性方面发展的，在计划工作上也初步积累了一些经验，但是科学计划工作还是很落后的，今后必须加强。
    在制定计划时，理论与实际的密切结合是必须遵行的原则。忽视这一原则，不认真考虑国家建设的需要，强调个人的兴趣，在任何时候都是不应该的。但我们决不能认为科学工作的任务就只限于解决眼前的问题。大体说来，科学院主要的应该是研究基本的科学理论和解决对于国民经济具有重要意义的关键性的科学问题，生产部门的科学研究机构主要的应当解决生产中的实际技术问题，高等学校的研究部则根据其具体条件研究基础的科学理论或实际生产中的科学问题。我们应该按照这样分工的原则来制定我国科学发展的远景计划。
      二、充分发挥科学家的力量、积极培养新生力量
    为了充分发挥科学家的力量，科学院和各科学机关的责任就必须深切关怀科学家的工作和他们的生活。我们应该为科学家保证必要的工作条件，保证他们的研究工作时间，解决他们在工作中遇到的各种困难。同时，我们也应该使科学家了解我们的国家要集中主要的力量完成主要的任务，因此，生活水平的提高、工作条件的改善是有一定的限度的；我们必须本着节约的原则，克服各种困难，积极进行科学研究。我们应该深入了解各个科学家的专长，按照他们的专长并结合国家需要予以适当的工作安排。我们应该尊重科学家的专门知识和他们的辛勤劳动。我们应该在政治上、思想上关心他们的进步，帮助他们学习马克思列宁主义，克服科学家中间还存在着的唯心主义、自由主义、个人主义、宗派主义等等错误思想。
    大力培养科学研究的新生力量，以壮大科学工作的队伍，是发展我国科学事业、保证我国建设进展的重要环节。这也是现有全体科学家的光荣职责。科学机构和科学家都必须十分重视这项工作。科学机构和高等学校应该建立或健全研究生制度，对青年科学工作人员订出培养和晋级的办法。青年科学工作人员的研究成果必须加以重视，各种学术会议应该尽可能吸收青年科学工作人员参加。高等学校最优秀的毕业生应尽可能让他们从事科学研究工作。要按照科学发展的需要有计划地、大量地派遣留学生到苏联等国家学习。为了实现这些任务，我们拟订了一项“中国科学院研究生暂行条例（草案）”提交本次会议讨论，修正后将呈请上级批准、实施。此外，科学院还将设置科学干部培养部来专门负责培养新生力量的工作；没有这一工作的负责推进，要希望科学队伍的日益壮大是不能设想的。
      三、建立学位制度、院士制度和学术奖励制度
    为了确立学术标准，鼓励从事科学研究工作的积极性，建立学位制度的条件我们认为是已经成熟了。我们将和各有关部门共同研究学位授予法的问题，在半年之内拟出草案，以便国家制定法律，并根据法律授予具有一定学术水平和成就的科学家以学位。“中国科学院研究生暂行条例（草案）”中已规定将初级学位授予毕业的研究生和通过论文答辩审查合格的科学工作人员。这个条例在获得法律效力后，即可实施。
    科学院是科学家的组织。发扬科学民主最好的形式就是院士制度、即以院士大会为科学院的最高机关的制度。我们也将和有关部门草拟关于院士制度的法律，经过批准后，我们将遴选我国最优秀的科学家作为第一批院士，呈请政府任命。根据国际的先进经验，第一批院士是由国家任命的，以后的院士将由院士大会选举产生。院士制度建立后，中国科学院即将召开第一次院士大会，通过选举，建立科学院的领导机构。院士大会的召开，将使科学院在现有基础上更进一步民主化，从而更好地领导我国科学事业的发展。
    对于科学发展和国民经济具有重大意义的科学成就，必须予以奖励。我们拟订了一项“中国科学院科学奖金暂行条例（草案）”，这个条例获得法律效力后，科学院将与高等教育部和各有关部门共同研究，在一年内颁发第一批科学奖金。除中国科学院科学奖金外，我们还需要研究各种形式的科学奖励办法。科学奖励制度的实施，对我国科学工作者将发生很大的鼓舞和推动作用，是毫无疑问的。
      四、加强国际间的科学合作
    加强国际间创造性的科学合作是我们迫切的需要，也是苏联和各人民民主国家的共同要求。我们必须认真地实践这项任务。以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的兄弟国家同在马克思列宁主义的旗帜之下，从事着共产主义和社会主义的建设，在好些科学工作的计划上，一定要取得密切的配合；不少的科学问题，要进行协同的研究；各种科学会议，要互相派人参加；科学书刊和资料，要更多地互相交换和赠送。特别在我们方面，希望有更多的苏联和各人民民主国家的科学家来参加和帮助我们的研究和建设工作，同时也要不断地愈来愈多地派遣我们的科学工作者到兄弟国家去学习。过去，这方面的工作我们做得不够，今后要积极地采取各种措施，予以加强。
    我们也要加强和其他国家特别是亚非国家科学家之间的联系和合作，交流经验，相互协助，为促进科学进步和维护世界和平而共同努力。
      五、加强学术领导
    我们有必要反复地说：科学院的领导工作是必须改进的，而改进科学院领导工作的关键即在于加强学术领导。我们今天成立四个学部，目的也就在这里。中国科学院各学部的重要任务之一，就是根据国家建设的需要和科学发展的规律，根据我国的现状，制定科学工作发展的长远规划和目前计划，检查计划执行情况，保证计划的顺利实现，并且根据情况的发展，在实践中改进计划。同时，各学部还有责任组织全国的科学力量，联系和调整各研究单位的工作，避免科学工作中的重复和遗漏的现象，充分运用和发挥各单位的特长，将分散的力量集中起来，用以解决国家建设的重要的任务。
    中国科学院本部和各学部还须要有计划地有领导地组织学习马克思列宁主义，采取各种适宜的方式去组织学术批评与讨论。发扬科学民主、开展学术批评和讨论是先进科学发展的关键，必须掌握这个关键才能领导科学。资产阶级唯心主义是我们的敌人。任何方面的工作，哪里受到了资产阶级唯心主义的腐蚀，哪里便不能健康的发展。科学领域尤其是这样。我们必须彻底批判资产阶级唯心主义，扫清科学前进道路上的障碍。
    现在，在全国范围内，广大干部和知识分子中，展开了反对胡风反动思想和反革命集团的规模壮阔的思想斗争，这是新中国政治生活中的重大事件，中国的科学家们应该勇敢地参加这个斗争，要认识到从思想上政治上组织上彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团才能保证中国社会主义革命的顺利进行。我要着重指出：不要说我们科学工作系统中便无胡风分子或类似胡风分子，这种想法是完全错误的，要知道反革命分子的破坏是无孔不入的，特别因为科学家们经常埋头于具体业务常常不过问政治，这一弱点更容易给胡风集团与类似胡风分子以可乘之机。我们必须加以警惕，在科学系统中展开反胡风斗争来肃清敌人和纯洁自己。
    此外，各个科学部门中的重要的科学理论问题和对国民经济具有重要意义的实际问题，这是科学院和学部的经常工作，必须经常召开会议来进行讨论。各个学术刊物也应该积极地负责组织和领导学术批评和讨论工作。
    除成立学部外，中国科学院还准备在某些地区组织地区性的学术委员会，各研究所也将成立学术委员会，组织院内外的优秀科学家分别领导各该地区和研究所的学术工作。通过现有二百三十三位学部委员以及将要参加到各学术委员会里来的学术委员的通力合作，科学院毫无疑问地将大大改进它和全国科学界与产业部门的联系。
    各位委员，我上面所提到的工作任务和改进工作的建议，请各位仔细讨论，希望能够得到修正和补充。
    我的报告快要结束了，请允许我把大家的责任再提醒一下。在国家建设中科学工作既占有十分重要的地位，党和政府根据人民的要求把领导学术工作这样崇高的任务交给了我们，我们要怎样才能担负得起这样的任务呢？我们有责任壮大我们的科学队伍，积极参加到国家建设事业的最前线。我们有责任把中国科学逐步提高到国际先进科学的水平，并能够提高整个人类的物质生活和文化生活。这个责任我们是一定要完成的，也一定能够完成的。我们应该有这样的信心。只要我们能够团结在党和毛主席的周围，认真地学习，认真地研究，认真地工作，实事求是，不断改进，不虚夸，不气餧，照顾到全局，照顾到未来，我们一定能够在实现社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的建设事业中逐步贡献出愈来愈大的力量，并使中国科学得到应有的发展。这样我们也就能够保障世界的和平和人类的幸福。
    祖国的前途是无限光明的，科学的前途也是无限光明的。
    让我们在马克思列宁主义的旗帜之下胜利前进！
