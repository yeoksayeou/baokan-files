Holding Good Cost Symposiums Is a Good Way to Mobilize Workers to Save
By Our Reporter Yu Ming

Holding cost symposiums is a good way to mobilize the masses of workers to save. The Huainan Coal Mine has implemented this method for almost a year, and those units that have earnestly implemented it have been able to reduce costs and overcome waste.

The Huainan Coal Mine initially held cost symposiums in the Guoqing Third Team of the Coal Mining Team in the Jiulonggang Mine. In the beginning, the cost accounting personnel first prepared a detailed cost plan for a coal mining working face, announced the cost targets to the workers, and organized the workers to study, so that the workers understood what constitutes cost, understood the prices of various raw materials, and then asked the workers to actively save and complete the cost reduction plan targets. After the masses mastered the cost plan targets, they organized workers to discuss every ten days to analyze the implementation of the cost plan in the previous ten days, find out the key problems existing in production, and mobilize the masses to find ways to solve them, so as to achieve the purpose of reducing costs and avoiding waste in the next ten days. After the Guoqing Third Team implemented this method in July last year, the five major indicators of output, quality, efficiency, cost, and safety all completed the plan, and more than 2,900 yuan was saved on the working face. The initial success of holding cost symposiums aroused the attention of the leading staff of the Mining Bureau and the workers of various mines. After September and October last year, cost symposiums were held in many production units in Jiulonggang, Datong, and Xin Zhuangzi, thus reversing the serious situation in which the Huainan Mining Bureau's overall cost overrun from January to July was 250,000 yuan, and the concept of attaching importance to cost indicators began to be established among the vast number of workers. This year, various mines have promoted the method of holding cost symposiums to the mine and district levels. Cost analysis is carried out in the mine-level symposium to solve the problems of the entire mine; cost analysis is carried out in the district-level symposium to solve the problems of the entire district.

The greatest benefit of holding cost symposiums is that workers understand what production costs are and how to save money through cost analysis. Various mines use various forms to publicize to the workers. The Jiulonggang Electromechanical Section used "rhymes" on big-character posters to tell workers the prices of various materials and encourage workers to calculate carefully. For example: "The price of oil is really not cheap, one catty can buy ten catties of noodles, find more tricks to save, and realize socialism early." "A pair of pliers costs more than 20 yuan, and the value is a stone of rice. Cherish the use of tools, they are all the property of the people." Some mines compiled the material prices into a "Common Material Conversion Manual" and distributed it to workers, so that they knew the preciousness of the materials they used. Many workers were surprised when they saw this manual and said: "My goodness, a nine-foot material costs more than six yuan, and even a small wooden wedge costs more than six cents. We must cherish it." Some people saw that each pneumatic drill bit was worth more than six yuan, and each square meter of bamboo fence was worth more than one yuan, and said: "We used to think that these things were worthless and did not count as costs. It turns out they are so expensive. We must use them well in the future." After such publicity and education, workers paid attention to saving everywhere in production.

The Guoqing Third Team of Jiulonggang implemented zoned coal mining, and the consumption of pit props increased by one time compared with the original plan. However, the workers displayed their patriotism and recovered as many pit props as possible for utilization. Worker Li Bingsheng said: "Old shafts are all Renminbi. Recovering one more pit prop will save the country several yuan." He proposed the method of replacing pillars with old materials, which increased the recovery rate of pit props. As a result, this team not only did not overspend on pit props, but also saved some pit props. The management and use of auxiliary materials in the past was very chaotic, and the consumption of bamboo fences, pneumatic drill bits, etc. was very large. After the workers raised this issue at the cost symposium, they all took the initiative to find the pneumatic drill bits that had been rusty and unused in the past and reused them. Through the workshop cost symposium, Datong Coal Mine universally established the idea of careful calculation among coal mining workers, prop workers, and pillar removal workers. For example, the prop workers pointed out at the symposium that in the past, in order to save trouble when building the waist support, they completely used new small pan materials. Now they realize that it is not cost-effective, and they quickly plugged this loophole. The pillar removal workers pointed out that in the past, most of the small materials recovered were not taken out. Now they realize that only with old materials can new materials be saved. When they see a material that cannot be taken out and the country loses this wealth, they are very anxious and try to recover it as much as possible. Transport workers also realized that "if the gangue is not picked up well, it will not only affect the quality of the coal, but also bring the gangue to the ground, waste electricity and transportation wages, and affect the cost." Repair workers also pay attention to recovering materials. Zhang Chengxi of the repair team said: "The more materials we recover, the more useful the materials we recover. The coal mining team can use less new materials, which can reduce costs, and can accumulate more national funds to build socialism."

Through the workshop cost symposium, the Coal Mining Fourteenth Team of Datong Coal Mine found that the prop workers used to build pillars regardless of the distance in order to build more pillars and earn more wages, which caused serious consumption of pit props. After everyone's research, a good method was adopted. When building pillars on the lower beam, they must use a rope ruler to measure it. Only when the distance is enough can they build pillars. When drilling holes and blasting in the Coal Mining Seventh Team of Caijiagang Coal Mine, due to the unqualified drilling and insufficient loading of explosives, the phenomenon of misfires occurred. After the workers discussed it at the cost symposium, they believed that this was a huge waste and decided to improve the operation method of drilling holes in the future. The No. 54 Team of Xin Zhuangzi Mine, due to the conservative thinking of the electricians, only allowed one pillar to be tied when using the pillar removal winch to remove pillars, which could not fully exert the effect of the pillar removal winch. At the cost symposium, the workers strictly criticized this conservative thinking, improved their work after the meeting, and increased the pillar removal rate by 30%. In the various mines of Huainan Coal Mine, there are many such examples, which shows that the cost symposium not only promoted cost reduction and savings, but also promoted the improvement of production methods.

After the implementation of cost symposiums at all levels, the various mines of Huainan Coal Mine have paid more attention to saving materials and reducing costs than before. In the past, leading staff at all levels generally paid attention to output and quality, and also paid attention to safety, but rarely asked about costs. Design did not consider costs, and the promotion of advanced experience did not calculate economic benefits. More seriously, some leading staff members did not understand costs at all, did not know the cost items, and no one looked at the cost plan after it was sent out. They were completely unaware of the economic activities. Cost management work was limited to accounting and did not understand the specific production situation, so they could not analyze the problems existing in production. Therefore, some people said that those who manage costs are: "Turn a deaf ear to the affairs of the entire mine, compile plans, make final accounts, and issue wages." The phenomenon of workers taking materials and throwing materials away was quite common. However, since the implementation of cost symposiums at all levels, all units that can persist in holding them can promptly understand the problems existing in production through cost analysis within one month. Cost management personnel have also found the correct direction of combining with production and have stipulated many feasible systems. Many workers have initially developed the habit of saving, and production management has been greatly advanced.

Since the implementation of cost symposiums in Huainan Coal Mine last year, the results have been remarkable, but there are also shortcomings in the work. In particular, the leadership was relaxed this spring, which caused some losses to this work. Since April, this work has been further strengthened. The Huainan Mining Bureau should earnestly hold good cost symposiums at the district and mine levels, and at the same time, it should strengthen the leadership of the team cost symposiums as much as possible on the existing basis, so as to further mobilize the masses and accumulate more funds for the country.

    开好成本座谈会是发动职工节约的好办法
    本报记者  于明
    举行成本座谈会是发动职工群众节约的一个好办法。淮南煤矿各矿实行这一办法快一年了，凡是认真实行的单位，都能降低成本，克服浪费。
    淮南煤矿最初是在九龙岗矿采煤队国庆三队举行成本座谈会的。在开始时，成本核算人员先编制一个采煤工作面的详尽的成本计划，向工人宣布成本指标，组织工人群众学习，使职工懂得那些东西构成成本，懂得各种原材料的价格，然后要求职工主动地节约，完成降低成本的计划指标，在群众掌握了成本计划指标以后，就在每一旬组织职工座谈，分析上一旬成本计划的执行情况，找出生产中存在的关键问题，发动群众想办法加以解决，以达到下一旬降低成本，避免浪费的目的。国庆三队去年七月实行这一办法后，产量、质量、效率、成本、保安五大指标都完成计划，并在工作面节约了二千九百多元。举行成本座谈会的这一初步成绩，引起了矿务局领导工作人员和各矿职工的重视，去年九、十月以后，在九龙岗、大通、新庄孜的许多生产单位都举行了成本座谈会，因而及时扭转了淮南矿务局全局一至七月成本超支二十五万元的严重局面，并开始在广大职工中树立了重视成本指标的观念。今年各矿又把举行成本座谈会的办法推行到矿级和区级，在矿级座谈会中经过成本分析，来解决全矿的问题；在区级座谈会中经过成本分析，来解决全区的问题。
    举行成本座谈会的最大好处，就是使职工通过成本分析，懂得了什么是生产成本，应该怎样节约。各矿利用各种形式向工人宣传。九龙岗机电科通过大字报上的“顺口溜”，把各种材料价格告诉工人，启发工人来算细账。如：“机油价钱真不贱，一斤可买十斤面，多找窍门来节约，社会主义早实现。”“牙钳一把二十多元，价值大米有一石，使用工具要爱惜，都是人民的财产。”有的矿把材料价格编成“常用材料换算手册”发给工人，使工人们知道自己所用的材料的可贵。许多工人看到这个手册时，惊讶地说：“乖乖，一根九尺料要六元多，连一个小木楔还要六分多，可不能不爱护。”有的看到每根风镐钎子值六元多，竹笆片每平方公尺值一元多时，就说：“我们过去认为这些东西不值钱，不算成本，原来这样贵，今后一定要好好使用。”经过这样的宣传教育以后，职工们在生产中就处处注意节约了。
    九龙岗国庆三队实行分区采煤，坑木消耗量较原计划增加一倍。但是工人们发挥了爱国主义精神，尽可能地多回收坑木加以利用。工人李炳生说：“老塘里都是人民币，多回收一根坑木就多给国家节省好几元。”他提出了用老料替柱的办法，使坑木回收率提高。结果这个队不但没有超支坑木，而且节约了一些坑木。辅助材料过去的管理和使用非常混乱，竹笆、风镐钎子等消耗量都很大。工人们在成本座谈会上提出这一问题后，都主动地把过去因生锈不用的风镐钎子，找出来重新利用。大通煤矿通过车间成本座谈会，在采煤工、支柱工、回柱工中，普遍树立了精打细算的思想。如支柱工人在座谈会上指出，以前腰帮打撑子为了省事，就完全使用新的小盘料，现在算算划不来，赶紧堵塞这个漏洞。回柱工人指出，以前回出的小料，大半截都不向外拿，现在认识到有了旧料才能节省新料，看到一根料拿不出来，给国家丢失这些财富，心里就很着急，都尽可能把它回出来。运输工人也认识了“如果矸子不捡好，不但影响煤质，还要把矸子提到地面，浪费电力和运输的工资，影响成本。”整修工人们也注意回料了。整修班张成喜说：“我们回出的料多，回出的料管用，采煤班就可以少用新料，就能降低成本，可以多积累国家资金，建设社会主义。”
    大通煤矿采煤十四队通过车间成本座谈会，发现支柱工人以前打柱子时，不管距离大小，为了多打柱子。能多得工资，就把柱子打得距离很近，造成严重的坑木消耗。经过大家研究后，采用了一个好办法，在下梁打柱时，一定用绳尺量一量，够了距离才打柱子。蔡家岗煤矿采煤七队在打眼放炮时，由于打眼不合规格，装药量不足，产生拔炮现象。在成本座谈会上，工人们讨论后，认为这是绝大的浪费，并决定以后改进打眼的操作方法。新庄孜矿五四队，由于电工思想保守，用回柱绞车回柱时，只准拴一根柱子，不能充分发挥回柱绞车的效能。在成本座谈会上，工人严格批判了这种保守思想，会后改进了工作，使回柱率提高了百分之三十。在淮南煤矿各矿，这种事例是很多的，它说明了成本座谈会不但促进了降低成本、达到节约，而且推动了生产方法的改进。
    实行各级的成本座谈会后，淮南煤矿各矿从上到下，对节约物资、降低成本都比以前重视了。过去各级领导工作人员一般都重视产量和质量，也重视安全，但对成本就很少过问，设计不考虑成本，推广先进经验也不计算经济效果。更严重的是，有的领导工作人员根本不懂得成本，不知道成本项目，成本计划送出后没有人看，对经济活动情况漆黑一团，心中无数。成本管理工作只限于算账，不了解具体的生产情况，不能分析生产中存在的问题。所以有些人说管理成本的人是：“掩耳不闻全矿事，编出计划，做出决算，发放工资就完事。”工人中乱领料、乱丢料的现象相当普遍。但是，自从实行各级成本座谈会后，凡是能坚持举行的单位，都能在一月之内通过成本分析，及时了解生产中存在的问题。管理成本的人员也找到了同生产结合的正确方向，规定了许多可行的制度。不少工人已初步养成了节约的习惯，生产管理工作大大推进了一步。
    淮南煤矿去年实行成本座谈以来，收效是显著的，但工作中也有缺点，特别是今年春天放松了领导，使这项工作受到了一些损失。从四月以后，才进一步加强这项工作。淮南矿务局应该认真把区级、矿级的成本座谈会开好，同时还应该尽可能在已有的基础上，加强对队的成本座谈会的领导，以便进一步发动群众，为国家积累更多的资金。
