Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 22nd—The Indian Cultural Delegation, invited to China for a friendly visit and performances, arrived in Shenyang by special train at 8:00 AM on June 22nd, led by delegation leader Chand.

Liu Baotian, Mayor of Shenyang, Shao Kai, Deputy Mayor, Shi Zhan, Director of the Liaoning Provincial Culture Bureau, Li Qiangfen, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office, Lu Kan, Director of the Shenyang Municipal Culture Bureau, and more than 500 representatives from cultural and artistic circles of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City welcomed the delegation at the station.

Numerous colorful flags were planted on the platform of Shenyang Railway Station. The welcomers gathered at the platform early in the morning to wait. When the special train carrying the Indian guests entered the station, people waved bouquets and cheered at them.

As soon as the delegation members stepped out of the train, Young Pioneers presented two large bouquets of flowers to delegation leader Chand and his wife. The delegation members also accepted the flowers presented by the welcomers, holding them up and waving to the welcomers in thanks.

As the guests drove to the Liaoning Hotel to rest, accompanied by Lu Kan, Director of the Shenyang Municipal Culture Bureau, they were warmly welcomed by the citizens along the way.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 22nd—Members of the Indian Cultural Delegation visited and toured the workers' village in Tiexi District, the industrial area of Shenyang, on the afternoon of June 22nd.

The guests visited the homes of many workers and staff members separately. Chand and his wife, along with some delegation members, first came to the home of old Mrs. Ju. Old Mrs. Ju's husband, Ju Xingzhi, and son, Ju Fuhai, both work at the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory. She replied to Chand, "I like it very much here, because we used to live in a dark and small house." The guests saw that in her clean and bright two-room house, there were pictures, flowers, a clock, and musical instruments, all arranged very comfortably and beautifully. When other guests came to the home of Li Suilong, a staff member of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, his family's radio was playing dance music, and the guests happily danced. V.K. Logia, a singer of Indian classical songs, also bought a pack of candies and gave them to a group of lively children who gathered around clapping and cheering them.

The guests then visited the workers' village staff consumer cooperative and the nursery of the state-owned Northeast Pharmaceutical General Factory. At the nursery, a group of two- or three-year-old innocent and lovely children sang several songs for them. Chand and his wife affectionately hugged and kissed the children. They also looked at the children's paintings.

The workers' residential area visited by the Indian guests today was built in 1952. One hundred and seventy-one buildings house more than 7,000 households, totaling more than 33,000 people. There are primary schools, consumer cooperatives, and nurseries here. This year, some cooperatives, middle schools, and hospitals will continue to be built. The guests got such a profound impression from the visit: The families of workers and staff living here are happy and comfortable. Chand said to the hosts: We spent a meaningful time here. He wished the workers' village to continue to expand.

In the afternoon, the delegation members also took a car to view the city of Shenyang.
