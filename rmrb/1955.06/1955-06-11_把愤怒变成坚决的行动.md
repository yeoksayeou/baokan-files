Turn Anger into Resolute Action
    Liu Daosheng

The third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the "People's Daily" proves once again that Hu Feng and his cohorts are by no means a small group of ambitious elements in cultural circles, but a complete and utter criminal group that includes many special agents and murderers. They are the most vile, insidious, and ferocious enemies of the people and youth of the entire country. Our vast numbers of Communist Youth League members and youth unanimously express infinite anger, condemn them in unison, and draw serious lessons from this incident.

Some of our young comrades still have some naive ideas: "The Hu Feng elements are cultural figures; they don't kill or set fires. Why are they a counter-revolutionary clique?" They forget that the class struggle in our country today is extremely sharp, complex, and extensive, and the struggle between the enemy and us is multifaceted, adopting various forms of struggle, both overt and covert. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, cloaked in the guise of Marxism, used deceptive double-dealing tactics to win over young people, attempting to establish strongholds within our revolutionary camp, dreaming of creating a restoration for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Is this not the most ferocious enemy of the people?

Some people also believe that Hu Feng and his accomplices "have talent" and "have theory," and it would be a pity if they were counter-revolutionaries. These people do not understand that their "talent" serves the counter-revolution, and their "theory" is a knife to paralyze young people and carry out "war of hearts". They should be subjected to the just sanctions of the people. If we still have petty-bourgeois sentimentality, that is compassion for the enemy and cruelty to the people.

Some young comrades think that "this is a matter for the cultural circles and has nothing to do with us." This is an even stranger idea. When a rat crosses the street, everyone shouts and beats it; how can a tiger sleeping beside us be allowed to live in peace? Hu Feng elements have already infiltrated some of our revolutionary organizations and even some leading organs of the Communist Youth League. It is time for us to wake up.

The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique shows that the enemy has not been completely eliminated. On the contrary, they are right beside us. The enemy will never be reconciled to their own demise. The stronger our revolutionary forces, the more intense the enemy's hatred of the revolution and the more frantic their sabotage, even disguising themselves as revolutionaries to undermine us from within. We must fully learn from this Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident, not only to wage a resolute struggle against all counter-revolutionaries but also to fight against some of the weaknesses that exist in our youth, such as blind worship, liking to show off, fearing struggle, and coveting fame and fortune, as well as bourgeois ideas. As long as our ranks are strong, our eyes are bright, and our vigilance is high, then we are invincible. At present, the struggle to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is unfolding widely and deeply across the country. All members of the Communist Youth League and the broad masses of young people, under the leadership of the Party, let us raise our political awareness, turn our anger into resolute action to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, stand at the forefront of the struggle, thoroughly investigate the Hu Feng elements, thoroughly investigate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, further purify our revolutionary ranks, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and thereby ensure the victory of the socialist cause.

    把愤怒变成坚决的行动
    刘导生
    “人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料再一次证明：胡风和他的同伙决不是什么文化界少数野心分子的小集团，而是一个十足的包括不少特务凶犯在内的罪恶集团。他们是全国人民和青年最卑鄙、最阴险、最凶恶的敌人。我们广大青年团员和青年一致表示无限的愤怒，同声讨伐，并从这一事件中吸取严重的教训。
    我们有一些青年同志还有些天真的想法：“胡风分子是文化人，又不杀人放火，为什么是反革命集团？”他们忘记了，今天我们国内的阶级斗争，正是非常尖锐、复杂和广泛的，敌人和我们的斗争正是多方面的，并且采取着公开和隐蔽的各种斗争形式。胡风反革命集团披着马克思主义的外衣，以两面派的欺骗手法，笼络青年，企图在我们革命营垒内部建立据点，梦想造成蒋匪帮的复辟，难道这还不是人民最凶恶的敌人么？
    还有人认为胡风及其同伙们“有才干”，“有理论”，如果当反革命分子，未免可惜了。这些人不了解他们的“才干”是为反革命服务的，他们的“理论”是麻痹青年和实行“挖心战”的刀子，他们是应当受到人民的正义制裁的。假如我们还有小资产阶级的温情主义，那就是对敌人的慈悲，对人民的残忍。
    还有些青年同志认为“这是文化界的事情，同我们没有什么关系”，这更是一种奇怪的想法。老鼠过街还人人喊打，怎么老虎睡在身边倒还可以安然无事呢？胡风分子已经混到我们某些革命组织内部，而且混到青年团的某些领导机关了，我们到了应当清醒的时候了。
    从胡风反革命集团的被揭露，说明敌人并没有完全被消灭，相反，他们就在我们的身边。敌人是决不会甘心于自己的灭亡的。我们革命力量越强大，敌人对革命的仇恨越强烈，破坏也越疯狂，甚至伪装成革命派从内部来破坏我们。我们必须从这次胡风反革命集团事件中，充分地吸取教训，不仅要和一切反革命展开坚决的斗争，而且要和我们青年本身存在的一些弱点，如盲目崇拜、好出风头、害怕斗争、贪图名利等资产阶级思想作斗争。只要我们的队伍是坚强的，眼睛是亮的，警惕性是高的，那末，我们就是不可战胜的。目前，粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争，正在全国广泛而深入地展开。全体青年团员和广大青年们，让我们在党的领导下，提高我们的政治嗅觉，把愤怒变成粉碎胡风反革命集团以及一切暗藏的反革命分子的坚决行动，站在斗争的最前列，彻底清查胡风分子，彻底清查一切暗藏的反革命分子，进一步纯洁我们的革命队伍，巩固人民民主专政，从而保证社会主义事业的胜利。
