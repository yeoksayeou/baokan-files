    Chongqing's local state-owned and private factories actively adopt substitutes and reduce raw material consumption, solving the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply and producing more products.
    After more than twenty soap factories in the city promoted a new formula of adding water glass and reducing wood oil consumption in soap, they saved more than 210,000 kilograms of wood oil from February to the end of May, which can be used to increase the production of more than 22,000 boxes of soap, and the quality of the soap is the same as before. In the first quarter, nine private rubber factories, including Zhongnan and Lihua, successfully trial-produced three new products, which are not only beautiful in shape and wear-resistant, but also reduced the amount of raw rubber used. The nine factories saved more than 2,000 kilograms of raw rubber in the first quarter, and it is estimated that more than 29,700 kilograms of raw rubber can be saved throughout the year. The leather industry throughout the city generally uses pigskin to replace cowhide. More than 80% of the various leather products such as leather shoes, suitcases, leather bags, and leather sofas produced by the local state-owned Chongqing Leather Factory currently use pigskin. From January to the present, more than 10,000 cowhides have been saved. This year, the Chongqing Fire Equipment Factory has replaced many products originally made of copper with pig iron, plastics, etc., which not only solved the difficulty of insufficient supply of copper materials, but also reduced costs.

    重庆地方工业积极采用代用品
    重庆市许多地方国营和私营工厂积极采用代用品和降低原材料消耗量，解决了原料供应不足的困难，还多生产了许多产品。
    全市二十多家肥皂厂推广了一种在肥皂内增加水玻璃和降低木油用量的新配方后，从今年二月到五月底就节约木油二十一万多公斤，可用来增产二万二千多箱肥皂，而且肥皂的质量和原来的一样。私营中南、利华等九个橡胶厂在第一季度试制成功了三种新产品，这些新产品不但形式美观、耐磨，而且降低了生胶用量。这九个厂第一季度节约的生胶已达两千多公斤，预计全年可节约生胶二万九千七百多公斤。全市皮革业都普遍用猪皮来代替牛皮。地方国营重庆皮革厂目前生产的各种皮鞋、皮箱、皮包、皮沙发等皮革用品，百分之八十以上都已采用猪皮，从一月到目前止，已节约牛皮一万多张。重庆消防器材厂今年以生铁、塑料等代替了许多原来用铜来制造的产品，不但解决了铜料供应不足的困难，还降低了成本。（新华社）
