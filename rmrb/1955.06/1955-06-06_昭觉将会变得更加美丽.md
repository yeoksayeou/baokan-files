    Zhaojue Will Become More Beautiful

    Editor:
    In recent years, Zhaojue in Xikang (the capital of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture) has changed a lot.

    Five years ago, there were only a few households here, truly "four doors could converse, one lamp illuminated the entire city." From 1952 and 1953, many new houses have appeared here one after another. From outside the West Gate to the foot of the nearby mountain, an area of about two li, rows of brand-new houses have become a bustling urban area. Many Yi people wearing various lace-trimmed dresses crowd in front of the trade companies and cooperatives, selling their hides, medicinal materials, and eggs, buying back cloth, salt, farm tools, and other things they need.

    The change in Zhaojue is rapid, and this change reflects the success of the Party's ethnic policy.

    In recent years, the Party has attached great importance to the training and education of ethnic minority cadres. By September 1954, there were a total of 212 Yi cadres in Zhaojue County, more than half of whom were leading personnel at all levels, and more than 60 of whom had been trained in various schools. A total of 287 Yi youths from the county have studied at the Xichang Ethnic Cadre School. In recent years, all the work in the county has been discussed and consulted at the People's Congress; in 1954, the representative of Gunila said at the People's Congress of the Autonomous Region: "The People's Government comes to seek your opinions on matters, asking whether you agree or not. This sentence is very valuable." This is the Yi people's evaluation of the work of the People's Government after enjoying the right to be masters of their own affairs. In actual work, the Yi cadres' level of awareness and working ability have been greatly improved. They expressed that they must humbly learn from the Han cadres, learn the Party's policies and working methods. Even the upper-class figures who participate in government work feel that only in this way can they truly shoulder the work they are undertaking.

    The People's Government's free distribution of iron farm tools has promoted tremendous changes in the production and life of the Yi farmers. Since Zhaojue County began distributing free iron farm tools in 1953, by September 18, 1954, a total of 52,437 pieces of various iron farm tools had been distributed to the masses, averaging more than two pieces per household. The Yi people were very excited after receiving the new and satisfactory farm tools. Bi Mu Ritu of Luoluojue Village, Wai Bei Township, Affiliated District, jumped up with joy after receiving a plowshare. He said: "Since I was eighteen years old, I have been thinking about buying a plowshare, but more than twenty years have passed, and this wish has not been realized; until liberation, the Communist Party came, and the People's Government gave me what I wanted! Now I have the capital for production, and I must produce well to repay Chairman Mao." Some Yi people in Shuma Gu Village, Chengnan Township, Affiliated District, have learned to use new-style walking plows and sprayers. Langdu Leze of Yuehuojue Village, Chengbei Township, adopted advanced farming methods, changing from broadcasting to spot sowing, and carried out inter-tillage weeding and the application of bone ash fertilizer. In 1953, the naked oats yielded 500 jin per mu, and he was selected as a special-class agricultural labor model in Xikang Province. Before liberation, Lanba Township in the Liberation Ditch area generally lacked six or seven months of grain every year, but now as long as it is not affected by disasters, every household has enough.

    Reforms in production, even if they are small, will bring great benefits to the people. Here, let us cite a specific material to illustrate the changes in the lives of the Yi people!

    In Ergu Township, Zhuhe District, there are 393 Yi households living together. They produce rice, corn, potatoes, naked oats, and vegetables, as well as ramie, wax insects, and other cash crops. Sheep can be grazed on the hillside. Women weave linen, wool, and felt in their spare time from farming or agricultural labor. In the era of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries, they lived in a state of poverty and backwardness for a long time, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. Qu Mu Hale, who is in his fifties, has a family of four with only two old and unusable farm tools. They have no food to eat from April every year until the new grain is harvested. The whole family cannot afford cotton clothes, and only he himself has a pair of cloth trousers, which he only wears when going out as a guest, and then hurriedly changes back to linen trousers when he returns home. After liberation, under the enlightenment, education, and leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, Qu Mu Hale actively and conscientiously worked hard in production and was selected as a labor model. The government awarded him an ox, and he bought another one himself; the People's Government also loaned him iron farm tools one after another. He now has ten various sizes of farm tools, and the whole family can wear cotton clothes.

    People like Qu Mu Hale who have improved their lives are only one of the thousands of Yi people. The changes in Zhaojue make me deeply feel that the face of the motherland is constantly changing. In a few years, Zhaojue will become more beautiful and lovely.

### 昭觉将会变得更加美丽

    昭觉将会变得更加美丽编辑同志：
    近几年来，西康昭觉（凉山彝族自治州的首府）的变化很大。
    五年以前，这里只有几户人家，真是“四门可对话，一灯照全城”。从一九五二年、一九五三年起，这里先后出现了许多新房子，从西门外直到近山脚约二里的地区，一幢幢崭新的房屋，已经成为热闹的市区。许多穿着各种花边衣裙的彝胞，拥挤在贸易公司和合作社的门前，卖出自己的皮张、药材和鸡蛋等产品，买回他们所需要的布、盐、农具等东西。
    昭觉的变化是很快的，这个变化反映了党的民族政策的成功。
    几年来，党对民族干部的培养和教育十分重视。到一九五四年九月止，昭觉全县共有彝族干部二百十二人，其中半数以上是各级领导人员，有六十多人是在各种学校培养出来的。全县先后到西昌民族干部学校学习的彝族青年共有二百八十七人。几年来，县里的各项工作都在人民代表会上进行讨论和协商；一九五四年，古尼拉打的代表在自治区人民代表会议上说：“人民政府有事就来征求你的意见，问你同意不同意，这句话很值钱。”这是彝族人民在享受到当家作主的权利以后给人民政府工作的评价。在实际工作中，彝族干部的觉悟程度和工作能力大大提高了，他们表示：必须虚心向汉族干部学习，学习党的政策和工作方法。就是参加政府工作的上层人物，也感到只有这样才能真正担负起自己所担负的工作。
    人民政府无偿地发放铁质农具，推动了彝族农民在生产和生活上发生了巨大的变革。昭觉县自从一九五三年开始发放无偿铁质农具以来，到一九五四年九月十八日止已发到群众手里的各种铁质农具共有五万二千四百三十七件，平均每户分得两件多。彝胞们在得到新的合意的农具后，十分兴奋。附城区外北乡倮倮觉村的比母日土领到一个铧口后，喜欢得跳起来，他说：“我从十八岁的时候，就想着要买一个铧口，但是二十多年过去了，这个愿望并没有实现；直到解放了，共产党来了，人民政府发给了我想望的东西！现在我有生产的本钱了，一定好好地生产，报答毛主席。”附城区城南乡叔马姑村的彝胞有的已学会使用新式步犁和喷雾器了。城北乡约火觉村的郎都勒则采用了先进的耕作方法，改撒播为点播，进行了中耕除草和施用骨灰肥等。一九五三年的莜子每亩得到五百斤的丰产，被评选为西康省特等农业劳动模范。解放沟区滥坝乡在解放前每年普遍缺六、七个月粮，现在只要不受灾害，每户都不缺了。
    生产上的改革，那怕就是微小的，都会给人民带来很大的利益。这里让我们引用一个具体材料来说明彝胞生活的变化吧！
    在竹核区的耳姑乡，聚居着三百九十三户彝胞，这里产水稻、苞谷、洋芋、莜子和蔬菜，也产苎麻、蜡虫等经济作物，山坡上能放牧羊群。妇女们在农闲或农业劳动之暇，兼织麻布、毛布和捍披毡，在蒋介石反动派统治的时代，他们长时期在贫困落后的状态下，过着牛马不如的生活。五十多岁的曲木哈勒一家四口人，只有两件破旧不能使用的农具，每年四月以后到新粮收上来以前就没有粮食吃了，全家穿不起棉布衣服，只他本人有布裤子一条，在出门作客时才穿一下，回家后又赶忙换穿麻布裤。解放后，曲木哈勒在共产党和人民政府的启发教育和领导下，积极认真地努力生产，被评选为劳动模范，政府奖给他一头耕牛，他自己又买了一头；人民政府又先后贷放了铁质农具，他现在已有各种大小农具十件了，全家也能穿上棉布衣服了。
    像曲木哈勒这样改善了生活的人，只不过是千万个彝胞中的一个。从昭觉的改变使我深深感到祖国的面貌时刻在变化着。几年以后，昭觉将会变得更加美丽可爱。　草林
