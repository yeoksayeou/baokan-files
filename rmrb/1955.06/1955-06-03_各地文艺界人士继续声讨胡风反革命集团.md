Literary and art circles and people from all walks of life in Shanghai, Wuhan, Sichuan, Hangzhou, Lanzhou, Anshan, and other places continue to expose and condemn the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. People from all walks of life unanimously support the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, demanding that the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng be dealt with according to the law; and they exposed the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members in various regions.

In Shanghai, all teachers, students, and staff of the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Drama held a meeting on May 25 to denounce and expose the evil activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. President Xiong Foxi said at the meeting: The conspiracy of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is ferocious and vicious, has been consistent for more than 20 years, and has now developed to a frenzy. We must closely unite around the Party and ruthlessly and thoroughly destroy this counter-revolutionary clique. Subsequently, many professors, assistant teachers, and students spoke at the meeting. Everyone indignantly exposed and criticized the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. Tian Jia and Ye Tao also exposed the conspiratorial activities of Liu Xuewei, Hu Feng's agent within the Party. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Artists Association also held a symposium on May 26 to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

In Wuhan, writer Yu Heiding exposed the crimes of Zeng Zhuo, a key member of the Hu Feng clique, who usurped the leadership of the Wuhan Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the "Changjiang Daily," sowed discord, and slandered the leadership of the Party.

At the meeting of academic, cultural, and artistic circles in Sichuan Province, Liu Lianchi, director of the Sichuan People's Art Theater, exposed the bad influence of Feng Yi, a member of the Hu Feng reactionary clique, in this theater.

In Hangzhou, 150 teachers and students of Zhejiang Normal College and more than 1,100 actors and staff of various drama troupes in Hangzhou held separate meetings, demanding a thorough reckoning of the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. Articles published in newspapers also warned Fang Ran, Ji Fang, and other members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in Zhejiang to quickly bow their heads to the people and confess their crimes.

In Lanzhou, the members of the Gansu Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Workers in Lanzhou held an enlarged meeting on May 29 to denounce the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. The meeting pointed out that before and after liberation, the reactionary tentacles of the Hu Feng clique had also extended to Lanzhou, and some people in Lanzhou's literary and art circles had established some connections with Hu Feng and had engaged in activities. Therefore, these people must be advised to confess the facts and deeply reflect. The meeting also called on literary and art workers throughout the province to actively criticize bourgeois idealist ideas and actively study dialectical materialist theory.

In Anshan, sixty cultural and artistic, educational workers, and amateur literary and art enthusiasts from steelmaking, rolling steel, and other factories and mines gathered on May 29 to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.
