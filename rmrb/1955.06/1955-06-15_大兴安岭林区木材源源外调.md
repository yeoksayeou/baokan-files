From our correspondent in Hohhot: The Greater Khingan Range forest areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are actively transporting railway sleepers, utility poles, mine props, etc., to meet the needs of Guangzhou, Qingdao, the Yumen Oil Mine, as well as steel plants, power plants, and coal mines in North China and Northeast China. The average number of trains dispatched daily in April and the first half of May increased by one-half compared to the first quarter. In the Tuli River forest area, the work efficiency of loading workers has increased from 60 carriages per day to 100 carriages. In May, the entire forest area overfulfilled its allocation plan by 12%.

    大兴安岭林区木材源源外调
    内蒙古自治区大兴安岭各林区正积极调运枕木、电杆、矿柱等，供应广州、青岛、玉门油矿以及华北、东北各钢铁厂、发电厂和煤矿的需要。四月份和五月上半月平均每天发出的列车比第一季度增加了二分之一。图里河林区装车工人的工作效率由每天装六十台提高到一百台。五月份全林区超额完成支拨计划百分之十二。
