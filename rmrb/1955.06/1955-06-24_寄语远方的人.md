Greetings to People in Distant Places
By Our Correspondent Shen Shi

	This April, I went to Xinjiang. In the offices and state-run stores of Urumqi, I saw many Han Chinese girls who could speak Uyghur. In the newly opened farms of the Manas River basin, I saw many female comrades who had come from afar, wearing military uniforms or blue work clothes. I wondered, how are they living? Do their loved ones far away miss them? In the production and construction corps, the instructor once said, "Comrade reporter! Write about them! So their parents and siblings will worry less and know how their loved ones are living."

	Indeed, these girls who have come from thousands of miles away to the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains are worthy of their relatives' pride. Those who came earlier were only sixteen or seventeen years old when they left their hometowns. Today, they are taller than they were at home. Some have learned production techniques, some can grow cotton, and some can drive tractors. They can all support themselves. When they were at home, they were so unfamiliar with Xinjiang. Those old textbooks and maps described Xinjiang as so desolate, and the hardworking and simple fraternal ethnic groups as so backward. From legends, the imagined Xinjiang was so terrible. Deserts, wind and sand that obscured the sky, uninhabited wilderness, people eating camel meat... Some people wavered when they heard this, and some were frightened and deserted halfway. However, they finally came and finally got to know Xinjiang. Xinjiang, the motherland's rich and beautiful land, is not desolate or terrible. The perpetually snow-capped Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains, with their continuous snowmelt, irrigate vast tracts of land. The fertile, overgrown wastelands of reeds and red willows are in need of people to come and cultivate; the endless treasures beneath the ground are in need of people to come and discover. They already have feelings for this place, just like in their hometowns, and are reluctant to leave it, wanting to settle here and build it into a beautiful paradise. Luo Guizu, only nineteen years old, was still a junior high school student when she left her hometown of Hengyang to come to Xinjiang. Today, she is an agricultural technician. In the experimental area of the Wula Usu Farm, she goes back and forth in the fields every day with a notebook, recording the growth of cotton, winter wheat, soybeans, and rice. Under the guidance of Soviet expert Titov, she and her classmates are full of confidence and eager to improve the varieties of various crops so that they can achieve high yields every year. Female tractor drivers Cao Keming, Qi Xiyun, and Xiao Manshu never imagined when they left their hometowns of Xiangtan and Changsha that one day they would be sitting on the driver's seat of a tractor, breathing the scent of the soil after plowing. Today, they patiently teach the skills they have learned to others. They hope that more people will operate more tractors and combine harvesters, crisscrossing the Junggar Basin and the Tieganlike grasslands. Women from Shandong, wearing work clothes, are plastering walls and painting doors and windows in front of buildings that are about to be completed. They hope that more buildings will appear in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, and more factories will stand tall. They want to use their own hands to paint the future buildings beautifully. The hearts of young people are full of lofty aspirations and long-term ideals.

	However, some people did not settle down smoothly after arriving in Xinjiang. The Party patiently educated them, and the selfless labor of the soldiers inspired them. They gradually developed new feelings for this beautiful land.

	Wang Yuanmeng, Wang Jinzhi, and Wang Fuzhen grew up in the same village. They heard that Xinjiang was a good place, where there were truly "upstairs and downstairs, electric lights and telephones." The three girls left their hometown, Houlonghe Village in Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, thinking that once they arrived in Xinjiang, they could enter a factory and live in a building. Who knew that when they arrived in the Wula Usu Company, what they had heard and imagined was not the case. There were no electric lights, no buildings, and they lived in dugouts. They felt disappointed, often missed home, and were unwilling to stay for a long time.

	One day, Deputy Regiment Commander Zhao Tang came to their company and entered their dormitory. The girls surrounded him. Wang Jinzhi pointed to the hemp rope hanging towels and said, "Deputy Regiment Commander! Look! The telephone in our dormitory." Zhao Tang smiled and did not answer them. Then, Wang Fuzhen pointed to the skylight and said, "Deputy Regiment Commander! Look at the electric light during the day." Zhao Tang had guessed what they meant, but he still smiled and did not answer immediately. Wang Yuanmeng pointed to the earthen steps leading in and out of the dugout and said, "Look at our building, one story, two stories, three stories..."

	"Have you been to the new city of Shihe on the banks of the Manas River?" Zhao Tang waited for her to finish and asked them with a smile.
		"Yes."
		"Are there any newly built buildings there?"
		"Yes."
		"Are there electric lights?"
		"Yes."
	"Yes, there are not only buildings there, but also several small factories. There are not only electric lights and telephones, but also post offices, banks, bookstores, accelerated middle schools, and well-equipped hospitals. In every residential area, there are also primary schools and nurseries. If you had come there in 1951, you would have only seen a wasteland, but today, people are used to calling it 'New City'."

	The girls listened attentively as the Deputy Regiment Commander described the changes that had taken place in the Manas River basin. Finally, the Deputy Regiment Commander asked them:
		"Comrades! Why did you come to Xinjiang?"
		"To participate in the construction of the border region."
	"That's very good, comrades! Participating in the construction of the border region doesn't mean you can live in a building as soon as you arrive. Who doesn't want 'upstairs and downstairs, electric lights and telephones'? However, to live in a building and install electric lights, we all have to work hard. The more effort we put in, the sooner it will come. Just saying witty remarks in the dugout will not lead us into socialist society, comrades! Settle down soon!"

	The Deputy Regiment Commander's words deeply inspired them. The girls had also heard some of the past deeds of this battle-tested hero. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he had fought in the Wanping and Mentougou areas. He had reclaimed wasteland in Linzhen and Luohechuan in northern Shaanxi. When the bandit Zong Nan invaded Yan'an, he participated in the battles of Qinghuabian, Yangmahe, Panlong, Shajiadian, and Wazigou. He once led a platoon to quickly occupy a commanding height in Shajiadian, making a great contribution. He was injured in the Wazigou battle. During the years of reclaiming wasteland and production in Xinjiang, he and the soldiers worked from morning till night, going back and forth in the fields, resulting in high yields of cotton, winter wheat, rice, and soybeans.

	After hearing his words and seeing the selfless labor of the soldiers, the girls became active. During the winter wheat harvest in 1954, Wang Yuanmeng could bundle 2,670 bundles of wheat every day, becoming the person who bundled the most wheat every day in the entire regiment. When the girls picked cotton, many male comrades could not keep up with them. Today, they want to tell the people in their hometowns that they want to live here for a long time. They want to carefully manage the cotton fields and make the yield per unit area of cotton exceed the record of 402 jin per mu in 1953.

	When Gong Wenmin, a girl of only seventeen years old, left Nancun Town in Pingdu County, Shandong Province, her mother chased her all the way from Pingdu to Weixian, finally catching up with the team going to Xinjiang. At night, the mother and daughter slept together, and the mother always nagged incessantly.
	"Wenmin: Why go to such a faraway place? Don't you think about your mother?"
	"Wenmin: There are many snakes and wild animals there. I'm always worried. Come home with me! It would be good to send you to school!"

	The mother's dissuasion could not shake the daughter's determination. Gong Wenmin still came to Xinjiang. Here, she learned sewing. Now she works in the Wula Usu guest house, receiving people who come to visit the farm. Sometimes, she and her comrades plant seedlings and cultivate flowers and trees together. Mother and daughter have deep affection. The mother often writes letters, asking her when she will come home. Gong Wenmin told her mother that she does not plan to come back for the time being. After the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty railway is open to traffic, she will come home. At that time, she will invite her mother to take the train to Xinjiang and see the farms, factories, and newly built cities here.

	People surveying the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty railway line have already entered Xingxing Gorge. Relatives in distant places! The opening of this railway is not far away. Your daughters, your sisters, are doing very well here. They are emitting light and heat. Please rest assured!

    寄语远方的人
    本报记者　沈石
    今年四月，我到了新疆，在乌鲁木齐的机关和国营商店里，我见过许多会说维吾尔语的汉族姑娘。在玛纳斯河流域新辟的农场里，我看见了许多穿军服或蓝色制服的远方来的女同志。我心里想，她们生活得怎样呢？远方的亲人是不是惦念她们呢？在生产建设部队的连队里，指导员曾经说过，“记者同志！写写她们吧！让她们的父母兄弟少挂念一点，让他们知道，她们的亲人是怎样生活着。”
    的确，这些从千里以外来到天山南北的姑娘，值得她们的亲人骄傲，那些来得较早的人，离开家乡时，只不过十六、七岁上下，今天，她们比起在家乡的时候，长得更高了，有的懂得了生产技术，有的会种棉花，有的会开拖拉机，她们都能自立了。她们在家乡时，对新疆是多么的生疏，那些旧的课本和地图，把新疆说得多么的荒凉，把勤劳朴实的兄弟民族说得多么的落后。从传说里，想像中的新疆是多么的可怕。沙漠、遮天蔽日的风沙、荒无人烟的原野，人们都吃着骆驼肉……有的人听了曾经动摇过，有的人却被吓倒了，在半路上开了小差。然而，她们终于来了，终于认识了新疆。新疆，祖国富饶美丽的河山，并不荒凉，并不可怕。终年积雪的天山、昆仑山，那源源不断的雪水，灌溉着万顷土地，那肥沃的丛生着芦苇和红柳的生熟荒地，多么需要人们前来开垦；那地底下无尽的宝藏，多么需要人们前来发掘。她们对这地方已经有了感情，像在故乡一样，舍不得离开它，要在这里安居下来，将它建设成美丽的乐园。年仅十九岁的罗桂祖，离开家乡衡阳前来新疆时，还是初中学生，今天，她成了农业技术员，在乌拉乌苏农场的试验区里，每天拿着本本，来往田间，记载棉花、冬麦、大豆、水稻的生长情况，她和她的同学，在苏联专家提托夫的指导下，满怀信心地渴望改良各种农作物的品种，让年年都能获得高额的丰收。女拖拉机手曹克明、齐西云、萧满淑，她们离开故乡湘潭和长沙时，谁也没想到有一天自己会坐在拖拉机的驾驶台上，呼吸那泥土翻耕后的气息；今天，她们将自己学得的技术耐心地教给别人，她们希望有更多的人，操纵更多的拖拉机和联合收割机，纵横在准噶尔盆地和铁干里克大草原上。那些从山东来的妇女，她们穿着工作服，在快要落成的建筑物跟前，粉刷墙壁，油漆门窗，她们希望天山南北出现更多的建筑物，矗立更多的厂房，她们要用自己的手，把未来的建筑物粉刷得漂漂亮亮。年轻人的心，都有崇高的愿望和长远的理想了。
    但是，有的人到了新疆，并不是一帆风顺地安下心来的。党耐心地教育她们，战士们忘我的劳动启发了她们，她们对这美丽的土地，才逐渐发生新的情感。
    王元孟、王进芝和王福珍是在一个村子里长大的。她们听说新疆是个好地方，那里真是“楼上楼下，电灯电话”，三个姑娘离开了自己的家乡山东荣成县厚龙河村，满以为一到新疆，便可以进工厂，住楼房。谁知到了乌拉乌苏的连队里，从前所听到的所想像的落空了，没有电灯，没有楼房，住的是地窝子，她们感到失望了，经常想家，不愿长期待下去。
    一天，副团长赵堂到了她们的连队，走进她们的宿舍，姑娘们把他围住了。王进芝指着挂手巾的麻绳说：“副团长！你瞧！咱们宿舍的电话。”赵堂笑了一笑，没有回答她们。接着，王福珍指着天窗说：“副团长！看看咱们白天的电灯。”她们话里的意思，赵堂已经猜透几分了，可是他仍然笑了一笑，没有立刻回答。王元孟指着出入地窝子土砌的阶梯说：“看看咱们的楼房，一层、两层、三层……”
    “你们到过玛纳斯河畔的石河新城吗？”赵堂等她说完，笑盈盈地问她们。
      “到过。”
      “那里有没有新建的楼房？”
      “有。”
      “有没有电灯？”
      “有。”
    “是的，那里不但有楼房，还有几座小型的工厂，不但有电灯、电话，还有邮局、银行、书店、速成中学和设备较完善的医院，每个住宅区里，还有小学、托儿所。假若一九五一年你们来到那里，只能见到一片荒地，然而今天，人们都习惯地称它
  ‘新城’了。”
    姑娘们凝神地听着副团长叙述玛纳斯河流域所起的变化。末了，副团长又问她们：
    “同志们！你们来新疆为了什么？”
      “参加边疆建设。”
    “这很好，同志们！参加边疆建设并不是一来就可住上楼房的。谁不希望‘楼上楼下，电灯电话’？可是，住上楼房，装上电灯，还要咱们大家努力，咱们多努力一分，它就早一天到来，光在地窝子里说些俏皮话，不会进入社会主义社会的，同志们！早些安下心来吧！”
    副团长的话，深深地启发了她们。这位身经百战的英雄过去的事迹，姑娘们也多多少少听到一些，他在抗日战争时期，曾经转战过宛平、门头沟一带；他在陕北的临镇、洛河川开过荒；胡匪宗南进犯延安，他参加过青化砭、羊马河、蟠龙、沙家店、瓦子沟等战役。他曾经率领一排人，迅速地攻占沙家店的一个制高点，立了大功；瓦子沟战役，他受过伤。在新疆开荒生产的几年里，他和战士们起早睡晚，来往田间，使棉花、冬麦、水稻、大豆获得了很高的产量。
    听过他的话，看到战士们忘我的劳动，姑娘们积极起来了。一九五四年收割冬麦时，王元孟每天能捆麦二千六百七十捆，成为全团每天捆麦最多的人。姑娘们摘棉花，许多男同志都赶不上她们。今天，她们要告诉故乡的人们，她们要在这里长期住下来了，她们要细心地经营棉田，使棉花的单位面积产量超过一九五三年每亩四百零二斤的纪录。
    年仅十七岁的姑娘龚文敏离开山东平度县南村镇的时候，她母亲从平度一直撵到潍县，总算追上了去新疆的队伍。夜里，母女两人睡在一起，母亲总是滔滔地缠个不休。
    “文敏：怎么去那样远的地方呢？难道不想一想你妈妈？”
    “文敏：那儿蛇多，野兽多，我总是放心不下。和我一道回家吧！送你上学校好咧！”
    母亲的阻留，动摇不了女儿的决心。龚文敏还是来新疆了。在这里，她学会了缝纫，现在她在乌拉乌苏的招待所里，招待那些参观农场的人，有时，她和同志们在一起，种植树苗，栽培花木。母女情长，母亲经常来信，问她什么时候回家。龚文敏告诉她的母亲，她暂时还不打算回来，等兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路通车后，她会回家的。那时候，她将邀请她的母亲，坐上火车，前来新疆，看看这里的农场、工厂和新建设的城市。
    草测兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路线路的人已经进入星星峡，远方的亲人们！这条铁路的通车并不遥远了。你们的女儿，你们的姐妹，在这儿过得很好，她们正在发出光和热，请你们千万放心吧！
