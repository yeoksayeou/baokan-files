    Resolutely Lower Standards for Non-Productive Construction
    Waste is a fairly common phenomenon in the management of state-owned capital construction, industry, transportation, commerce, and other economic and cultural undertakings in our country. This waste is particularly evident in non-productive buildings such as offices, dormitories, schools, hospitals, theaters, warehouses, and stations. These non-productive buildings account for a considerable proportion of the state's overall capital construction projects, and the standards generally required by the construction units are very high, far exceeding our country's current economic level and the people's living standards, thus wasting a large amount of construction funds. Therefore, resolutely lowering the standards for all non-productive buildings is one of the main tasks of practicing economy at present.
    Non-productive construction is a component of capital construction, but it is not the main part. The main part of capital construction is productive construction, such as factories, mines, and railways, which are the material foundations for realizing the country's socialist industrialization. In these productive constructions, we must learn as much as possible from the latest achievements of Soviet science and technology in order to improve our country's technical level and accelerate the development of the national economy. Therefore, relatively more funds may be needed, but every effort should also be made to save building materials and reduce construction and installation costs. As for non-productive buildings, they serve production and do not create value themselves; lower construction standards will not hinder production. On the contrary, it can free up funds to develop production. Since our country is still in the initial stage of construction, the economy is still very backward, and the funds needed for productive construction are far from sufficient, non-productive buildings must, of course, be simplified in every way.
    However, many comrades do not understand the different natures of these two parts of capital construction, and they use excessive funds on non-productive buildings. Disregarding the specific conditions that our socialist construction has just begun and the level of production development and people's living standards are still very low, they use large amounts of investment to build office buildings, auditoriums, dormitories, and clubs with excessively high standards. Even after the National Conference of the Communist Party of China issued a call for comprehensive economy, and after the Party Central Committee and local Party organizations exposed and criticized the waste of non-productive construction on a large scale, many units are still demanding the construction of high-standard office buildings, staff dormitories, and sanatoriums; the "big roofs" of some office buildings have still not been removed from the project; although many projects have reduced some unnecessary decorations and false structures, they have not resolutely lowered the construction standards. Obviously, this error can no longer be allowed to continue to develop.
    In order to thoroughly overcome all kinds of waste and vigorously accumulate funds for socialist industrialization, the Party Central Committee has recently decided to take a series of specific measures. In terms of urban construction, the Party Central Committee requires that planning be carried out anew in the spirit of economy: generally, high-rise buildings are not allowed to be built in industrial cities that have already been planned; cities where industry is not very concentrated should make as much use as possible of old cities and old buildings, and there is no need to reconstruct them; in each city, various public utilities should be developed step by step, according to priorities, and everything should not be sought to be complete and new. The Party Central Committee specifically requires that the standards of various non-productive buildings be greatly reduced, namely: the cost per square meter of offices and university classrooms should be reduced from 100 yuan to 45 to 70 yuan; the cost per square meter of housing should be reduced from about 90 yuan to 20 to 60 yuan; the cost per square meter of general-purpose warehouses should be reduced from 70 or 80 yuan to 40 to 50 yuan; and the cost per square meter of stations should be reduced from 80 to 130 yuan to 30 to 70 yuan. The instructions of the Party Central Committee embody the correct policy of practicing economy, accumulating funds, and concentrating the use of funds on productive construction, which the entire Party must lead the people to implement resolutely.
    In order to promote and implement the new standards for non-productive construction, all state workers, especially those in senior leading organs and enterprise management departments, must have a thorough change in their thinking. Some people may feel that the standards have been lowered too much and too quickly, and even look for various specious excuses to prove that this approach may affect work, production, learning, etc. However, this "worry" is unfounded. Everyone should remember that Lenin lived in a shack near the Razliv station in July 1917, where he still led the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party and the work of the Party Central Committee, and wrote papers next to the bonfire. From 1936 to 1947, Comrade Mao Zedong and many other leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee lived in cave dwellings in northern Shaanxi and victoriously led the Chinese revolution; many of Comrade Mao Zedong's important works were written there. During the domestic war and the War of Resistance Against Japan, the leaders of various base areas persisted in working, running schools, and training troops under extremely difficult conditions, defeating powerful enemies with "millet plus rifles." Even today, in most parts of the country, many county, district, and township workers still work and live in simple houses, not to mention the vast number of workers and peasants. Compared with these, the living and working conditions of many comrades in cities and industrial and mining areas are still much better, even after the construction standards of dormitories, offices, etc. are lowered. How can there be any difficulties in work and life? Therefore, those who have been complaining in this regard should feel ashamed in the face of the history of revolutionary struggle and in the face of the broad masses of working people, and should thoroughly correct their erroneous ideas and resolutely fight to implement the Party Central Committee's various instructions on comprehensive economy.
    Perhaps some people will also think that lowering construction standards is contradictory to improving the people's lives. This view is also incorrect. Improving the cultural and material life of the masses is the unwavering goal of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government. However, the improvement of the people's lives must be based on the development of production. If production does not develop, where will the money come from to run welfare undertakings? Now, some newly built factories have not yet started production and have not yet created wealth for the people, but perfect sanatoriums, clubs, and green areas have been built, while the inexpensive facilities urgently needed by workers have been neglected. This is clearly a violation of the interests of the entire national economy and the long-term interests of the people. Factories and mining enterprises should gradually build these welfare facilities after they start production, according to the state of improving labor productivity, reducing costs, and completing profit plans: if production performance is good and the contribution to the country is great, welfare facilities will increase faster; otherwise, they will increase more slowly. This can stimulate people to work hard to increase production and improve their enthusiasm for building socialism. Moreover, when carrying out non-productive construction, we must also pay attention not to deviate from the current economic level and people's living standards, and blindly adopt excessively high standards, because this will not only cause huge waste to the country, but also fail to meet the needs of the masses. The masses demand to build more cheap houses quickly so that everyone has a place to live; but if the cost is high, then necessarily fewer will be built, and they will be built more slowly, and even if they are built, the workers will not be able to afford to live in them, and they will not be convenient for the workers' current simple life. The staff dormitories built by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant are too expensive, and each household has to pay more than ten or even forty yuan per month in rent, and the staff are unwilling to live there. On the other hand, the small houses of seven or eighty yuan a room built by the staff of the Yangjia Zhangzi Mining Bureau in Liaoning Province are very popular. This shows that the subjective approach that is divorced from reality seems to be a mass viewpoint in form, but in fact, it not only harms the long-term interests of the masses but also violates the current demands of the masses.
    Adopting new construction standards and other austerity measures in non-productive construction has tremendous economic significance. According to preliminary calculations by various departments, implementing new construction standards and cutting unnecessary non-productive construction projects can save more than 100 million yuan in investment in the next two and a half years. With this fund, we can increase many important construction projects, such as adding railways, expanding the exploration scale and production capacity of the petroleum industry, reclaiming new wasteland, etc., all of which have a significant impact on the development of our national economy. At the same time, implementing these standards also has great political significance. Because lowering the living facility standards of urban administrative organs and industrial and mining enterprises can bring the staff of Party and state organs and the management personnel of enterprises closer to the lives of the masses, it can continue to promote the fine tradition of hard struggle and sharing weal and woe with the people, and draw a line between the bourgeoisie's enjoyment of life and wasteful habits, thereby further strengthening the unity of the people of the whole country.
    Since lowering non-productive construction standards has such significant meaning, we must, of course, unswervingly implement it to the end. The Chinese people are hardworking and thrifty, and the Communist Party of China has a tradition of hard struggle. We are confident that we can realize the call of the Party Central Committee. Today's efforts are for tomorrow's happiness. This truth will surely give the entire Party and the people of the whole country the strength to overcome all difficulties.

### 坚决降低非生产性建筑的标准

    坚决降低非生产性建筑的标准
    在目前我国国营的基本建设事业、工业、运输业、商业以及其他经济事业和文化事业的管理中，浪费现象是相当普遍的。这种浪费现象在基本建设中，特别是在办公室、宿舍、学校、医院、剧院、仓库、车站等类非生产性建筑中，表现得更为明显。这些非生产性的建筑在国家整个基本建设工程中占有不小的比重，各建筑单位要求的标准一般又都很高，远远超过目前我国经济水平和人民生活水平，因而浪费了大量的建设资金。因此，坚决降低一切非生产性建筑标准，乃是当前厉行节约的主要任务之一。
    非生产性的建筑是基本建设的一个组成部分，但不是基本建设的主要部分。基本建设的主要部分是生产性的建设，例如工厂、矿山、铁路，这些才是实现国家的社会主义工业化的物质基础。在这些生产性的建设中，必须尽可能学习苏联科学技术上一切最新的成就，以便提高我国技术水平，加速发展国民经济，因此不能不需要比较多的资金，但也应当用一切努力来节约建筑材料和降低建筑安装成本。至于非生产性的建筑是为生产服务的，本身并不创造价值；它们的建筑标准低一些并不妨碍生产，相反地还可腾出资金来发展生产。既然目前我国还处在建设初期，经济还很落后，生产性建设所需要的资金还很不充分，非生产性建筑当然就必须一切从简。
    可是有许多同志不明白基本建设中这两个部分性质的不同，他们把过多的资金用在非生产性的建筑方面。他们不顾我国社会主义建设刚刚开始，生产发展水平和人民生活水平还很低的具体条件，用大量的投资去建设标准过高的办公楼、大礼堂、宿舍和俱乐部。甚至在中国共产党全国代表会议提出全面节约号召以后，在党中央和各地党组织大量地揭发了和批评了非生产性建筑的浪费现象以后，有许多单位还在要求修建标准很高的办公大厦、职工宿舍和休养所；有些办公大楼的“大屋顶”仍然没有从工程项目中减去；有许多工程虽然削减了一些不必要的装饰和虚假的结构，但也没有坚决降低建筑标准。很明显，这种错误是不能再听其继续发展的了。
    为了彻底克服各种浪费，大力积累社会主义工业化的资金，党中央最近决定采取一系列的具体措施。在城市建设方面，党中央要求用节约的精神重新进行规划：已经规划的工业城市，一般不允许盖高层建筑；工业不很集中的城市，要尽量利用旧城市、旧建筑，不必进行改建；各城市中，要分别轻重缓急，逐步举办各种公用事业，不应一切都求全、求新。党中央特别要求大大降低各种非生产性建筑的标准，即：办公室和高等学校的教室每平方公尺由一百元降至四十五元至七十元；住宅每平方公尺由九十元左右降至二十元至六十元；通用仓库每平方公尺由七、八十元降至四十至五十元；车站每平方公尺由八十元至一百三十元降至三十元至七十元。党中央的指示体现了厉行节约、积累资金、集中使用资金于生产性建设的正确方针，全党必须领导人民群众加以坚决执行。
    为了推行贯彻非生产性建筑的新标准，全体国家工作人员，特别是高级领导机关和企业管理部门的工作人员必须在思想上有一个彻底的转变。可能有一些人会觉得标准降得太低、太快，甚至寻找各种似是而非的借口来证明这种做法可能影响工作、生产、学习等等。但是，这种“担心”是没有根据的。大家总该记得，列宁在一九一七年七月间曾住在拉兹里夫车站附近的草棚里，就在那里他仍然领导着布尔什维克党第六次代表大会和党中央委员会的工作，并且在火堆旁边写作论文。从一九三六年到一九四七年，毛泽东同志和中共中央的其他许多领导同志一直住在陕北的窑洞里，胜利地领导了中国革命运动；毛泽东同志许多重要的著作都是在那里写成的。在国内战争和抗日战争时期，各根据地的领导者都曾在极端困苦的条件下坚持工作、办学校、训练部队，用“小米加步枪”战胜了强大的敌人。就是在今天，在全国绝大部分地区，很多县、区、乡的工作人员，也还是在简陋的房屋中工作和住宿，更不用说广大的工人农民了。和这些相比，目前很多城市和工矿区同志们的居住条件和工作条件，就在宿舍、办公室等等的建筑标准降低以后，仍然是好得太多了，哪里会发生工作上和生活上的什么困难呢？因此，一直在这方面叫苦的人，应该在革命斗争的历史面前和广大的劳动人民面前感到惭愧，应该彻底改正自己的错误思想，坚决为实现党中央关于全面节约的各项指示而斗争。
    也许有些人还会认为降低了建筑标准同改善群众生活有矛盾。这个看法也是不对的。改善群众的文化和物质生活，是中国共产党和人民政府的坚定不移的奋斗目标。但是群众生活的改善必须建立在生产发展的基础上。如果生产不发展，怎么会有钱去办福利事业呢？现在，有一些新建工厂还没有开始生产，还没有给人民创造财富，就造起了完善的休养所、俱乐部、绿化地区等等，而工人迫切需要的、花钱不多的设施却被忽视了。这显然是违反整个国民经济的利益，违反人民群众的长远利益的。厂矿企业都应当在开始生产以后，根据提高劳动生产率、降低成本和完成利润计划的状况来逐步修建这些福利设施：生产成绩好，对国家贡献大，福利设施就增加得快些；否则，就增加得慢些。这才能刺激人们去努力增产和提高建设社会主义的热情。而且在进行非生产性建筑的时候，还必须注意不要脱离目前的经济水平和人民生活水平，盲目地采用过高的标准，因为这样不但会给国家造成巨大的浪费，也不能适应群众的需要。群众要求赶快多盖一些便宜的房屋让大家有得住；但是造价高了，就必然造得少，造得慢，而且造好了工人还住不起，对工人目前的简单生活也不方便。第一汽车制造厂和齐齐哈尔机车车辆厂建造的职工宿舍，因为造价太高，每户每月要收十多元以至四十元以上的房租，职工们都不愿意去住。而辽宁省杨家杖子矿务局的职工自己出钱造成的七、八十元一间的小房子，反而很受欢迎。这说明，脱离实际的主观主义的做法，形式上好像是群众观点，实际上是既损害了群众的长远利益，也违背了群众目前的要求。
    在非生产性建筑方面采取新的建筑标准和其他节约措施，有巨大的经济意义。根据各部门的初步计算，实行新的建筑标准和削减不必要的非生产性的建设项目之后，可以在今后两年半的投资中节省出十多万万元的资金。用这笔资金，我们可以增加很多重要的建设项目，例如增修铁路，扩大石油工业的勘探规模和生产能力，开垦新荒地等等，而这些对于我国国民经济的发展都是有重大作用的。同时，贯彻这些标准，在政治上也有巨大意义。因为降低了城市行政机关和工矿企业的生活设施标准，就可以使党和国家机关的工作人员以及企业的管理人员同群众的生活更加接近，就可以继续发扬艰苦奋斗、与人民共甘苦的优良传统，而与资产阶级的享乐思想和浪费习气划清界限，从而也就能够进一步加强全国人民的团结。
    降低非生产性建筑标准既然有这样重大的意义，我们当然必须毫不动摇地把它贯彻到底。中国人民是勤劳俭朴的，中国共产党是有艰苦奋斗的传统的，我们有信心实现党中央的号召。今天的努力是为了明天的幸福，这个真理一定能够给全党和全国人民以战胜一切困难的力量。
