    Actively Prevent Cargo Losses in Water Transport
    Kong Sang
    A recent business work conference held by the Shandong Provincial Shipping Bureau examined the serious situation of cargo losses and discovered that many comrades lacked a sense of responsibility for protecting state property.
    Many such things have happened: The boats of the Yellow River Shipping Office were leaking and were clearly not suitable for loading flour. The workers suggested repairs, but the cadres said: "This is a long-distance transport, so what if a few hundred pounds of flour get wet, what does it matter if we pay a few yuan? The freight income will more than cover the compensation." The hold of a ship transporting salt had water in it, and the salt was poured in without cleaning the hold. Someone saw the salt dissolving and felt heartbroken, but some people even tried to "get their thinking straight" by saying: "Salt swells when it meets fresh water, guaranteeing that we won't have to pay compensation." Even such things happened: The Longkou Shipping Station was to transport a batch of burlap sacks to Jinan, knowing that the rain protection equipment on the ship was too poor, and that loading them on the deck would inevitably expose them to splashing waves and rain. Instead of actively trying to solve the problem, they ran to the consigning unit to declare that "we are not responsible for water damage." By the time they arrived in Jinan, hundreds of sacks had indeed become moldy.
    These comrades did not consider the state's property from the perspective of the overall interest, but from the perspective of the local interests of their own unit. As long as they could "not be responsible," could avoid compensation, or even if they had to pay compensation, the income and expenses would still be profitable, they didn't care that the sacks were rotting from splashing waves and rain, that the flour was soaked by leaking water, or that the salt was dissolving in the water accumulated in the hold.
    Although the quality of water transportation has greatly improved compared to the past, the phenomena that the Shandong Provincial Shipping Bureau examined are, after all, not isolated cases. Some business departments of water transport, in order to quickly load and unload and complete ton-kilometer plans, often violate operating procedures. Boxed goods are thrown from the deck into the hold, materials marked as "do not invert" are deliberately turned upside down, and boxes marked as containing fragile materials are rolled around on the ground. As a result, things that shouldn't be crushed are crushed, things that shouldn't be wet are soaked, and items are lost in number and weight. According to incomplete statistics, in 1954, the Ministry of Transportation had already spent 150,000 yuan in compensation for cargo damage and discrepancies in water transportation.
    However, cargo losses are far from compensated by compensation. The production and distribution of our country are mostly planned. Losses in transportation often cause difficulties for other sectors of the national economy in implementing plans. For example, if a machine ordered by a factory or construction site after careful calculation is damaged in transit, lacking parts, or deformed, and cannot be installed in time after arrival, it will inevitably affect the completion of the state's production plan and capital construction plan. A commodity is transferred to a city or market town based on market needs. If it is damaged in transit, it cannot meet market needs and may even create artificial shortages. Can these losses all be compensated with a few yuan?
    The business departments of water transport must strengthen political and ideological education, improve employees' sense of responsibility for protecting state property, and especially urge those cadres who are hiding in dark corners and making their own small calculations to break free from the departmentalism of only caring about the part and not the whole.

    积极防止水上运输中的货运损失
    孔桑
    山东省航运局最近召开的一次商务工作会议，检查了货运损失的严重情况，发现许多同志缺乏爱护国家财产的责任感。
    曾经发生过不少这类的事情：黄河航运办事处的船只漏水了，显然不宜装面粉。工人提议修理，干部却说：“这是长途运输，湿几百斤面粉，赔几个钱算啥？运费收入作赔偿根本用不完。”运盐的船舱里有水，不清舱就把盐倒了进去。有人看见盐溶解了，感到心痛，但竟也有人这样来“打通思想”：“盐遇淡水能涨秤，保证赔不了钱。”甚至还发生这样的事情：龙口航运站要向济南运送一批麻袋，明知船上防雨设备太差，装在舱面上必然要受浪溅雨淋，却不积极设法解决，反跑去向托运单位声明“水湿不负责任”。待运到济南，几百条麻袋真的都霉烂了。
    这些同志对待国家的财产，不是从整体利益来考虑，而是从本单位的局部利益来考虑。他们只要可以“不负责任”，可以不赔偿，或虽要赔偿，但收支相抵还是有利可图，就不管麻袋在浪溅雨淋中霉烂，面粉被漏水浸湿，食盐在舱内的积水里溶解了。
    水上运输的质量，比起过去来，虽然大有提高，但像山东省航运局检查出的这些现象，毕竟不是个别的。有一些水上运输的商务部门为了快装快卸，完成吨公里计划，常常违反操作规程。箱子货由舱面抛入舱内，注明不能倒置的物资偏偏倒了过来，注明装有易碎物资的箱子偏偏在地下翻来滚去。结果，不是怕砸的砸坏了，怕湿的浸湿了，就是丢了件数，少了斤两，据不完全的统计，一九五四年，为了水上运输的货损货差，交通部已支出了赔偿费十五万元。
    可是货运损失远远不是赔偿所能弥补的。我们国家的生产和分配，大部分都是有计划的。运输中的损失，往往造成其它国民经济部门执行计划的困难。例如一个工厂或工地，精打细算后订购的机器，如果在运输中受到损伤，缺了零件，变了形，运到后不能及时安装，必然影响国家生产计划和基本建设计划的完成。一种商品运到一个城市或集镇上去，都是根据市场的需要来调拨的，如果在运输中受到损伤，就不能满足市场需要，甚至造成人为的供不应求。这些损失难道都是赔几个钱能够弥补的吗？
    水上运输的商务部门必须加强政治思想教育，提高职工对爱护国家财产的责任感，特别是要促使那些躲在暗角里打自己的小算盘的干部，从只顾局部，不顾整体的本位主义思想里解脱出来。
