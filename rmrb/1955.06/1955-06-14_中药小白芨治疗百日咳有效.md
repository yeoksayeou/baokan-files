    Traditional Chinese Medicine Baiji Effective in Treating Whooping Cough
    Rao Xianyi, a lecturer at the Yunnan University School of Medicine, has recently completed preliminary research on using the traditional Chinese medicine Baiji (Bletilla striata) to treat whooping cough in children.
    Baiji is a wild plant produced in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei and other provinces.
      Since 1952, Rao Xianyi has used this medicine to treat nearly 400 children with whooping cough, with a cure rate of over 70%. Treatment results also prove that this medicine has no side effects.
      She is now studying the use of Baiji to treat tuberculosis. Experiments using this medicine on eighteen cases at the Yunnan University Affiliated Hospital have shown that the patients' conditions have improved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中药小白芨治疗百日咳有效
    云南大学医学院讲师饶娴宜最近初步完成了利用中药小白芨治疗小儿百日咳的研究工作。
    小白芨是一种野生植物。产在云南、四川、贵州、湖南、湖北等省。
      饶娴宜从一九五二年起，就用这种药治疗了近四百个患百日咳的小儿，痊愈率达到百分之七十以上。治疗结果还证明这种药没有副作用。
      现在她正在研究用小白芨治疗肺结核病。经云南大学附设医院用这种药对十八个病例的实验，病人的病情都有好转。　（新华社）
