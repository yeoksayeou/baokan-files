    Saving Grain by Using Mulberries to Make Wine
    Liu Fan, Zheng Feng
    The Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Monopoly Business Corporation (hereinafter referred to as Zhejiang Provincial Company) has successfully used mulberries to brew white wine and liquor. Using mulberries instead of grain for winemaking can greatly reduce grain consumption. In 1954, the Zhejiang Provincial Company test-brewed more than 1,000 jin of mulberry wine in the Jiaxing Special District. Every 1,000 jin of mulberries brewed into liquor is equivalent to the wine brewed from 250 jin of grain. This year, they decided to expand the plan and brew 30,000 jin of mulberry wine.
    According to tests, mulberry wine is not significantly different from wine brewed from ordinary grain. Its alcohol content exceeds specifications, and its acid content is very small; the tongue can no longer detect the sour taste. Liquor made from mulberries is purple-red in color and sweet in taste, similar to wine. It is much cheaper than simply packaged red wine sold on the market and is very popular among consumers. During the Mid-Autumn Festival in 1954, the wholesale department affiliated to the Jiaxing branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Company began trial sales, and the more than 1,000 jin of "mulberry wine" produced in the trial were sold out in less than a week. The masses have been asking for continued supply.
    Many difficulties were encountered in the trial production of mulberry wine. Initially, according to the winemaking methods for fruit wines, liquid fermentation using yeast was necessary, but there was no yeast. In addition, there was much rain in the spring of 1954, and the mulberries were hit by rain before they were picked, reducing the sugar content of the juice, which would affect the quality of the wine. The staff of the Commercial Organization and Technology Section of the Zhejiang Provincial Company studied this problem and used glutinous rice and distiller's yeast to brew a starter instead of yeast. At the same time, the sugar content of the starter also compensated for the lack of sugar content in the mulberries. As for the difficulties with equipment, they did not have fruit juice presses, high-pressure sterilizers, coolers, closed fermentation tanks, and filters used for making fruit wines, nor did they have the testing equipment necessary for making fruit wines. They tried to use the existing yellow and white wine brewing equipment in Jiashan, Wuxing and other places. When the mixed wine test was performed at the same time as the mulberry juice and starter were mixed and fermented, new difficulties arose: the wine turned purplish-black, and a sip would stain the teeth and mouth black. Could mulberries really be used to make wine? The employees debated. Finally, from practical observations and references to relevant books on fruit wine making, they deduced that the reason why mulberry wine turned black was that mulberries contained a substance called "tannin," which underwent a chemical reaction when boiled in an iron pot, turning into "tannin iron." After four or five days of fermentation, the pigment gradually subsided.
    Mulberry wine is made after more than ten operations, including making the starter, pressing the mulberry juice, sterilizing, mixing and fermenting, pressing the wine mash, clarifying, boiling, and sealing the jars, and it safely survived the summer.
    According to statistics from 37 counties, including Wuxing, Jiaxing, and Chongde, the main silkworm areas in Zhejiang, there are 1.31 million mu of mulberry gardens that can produce mulberries; wild mulberries are even more impossible to count. Wuxing County's 211,420 mu of mulberry gardens, calculated at 50 mulberry trees planted per mu and 2 jin of mulberries produced per tree, can produce 21,142,200 jin of mulberries annually. If all of them were used to produce mulberry wine, 12,332,600 jin of liquor could be produced, saving more than 3,083,000 jin of grain. If the mulberries from all 1.31 million mu of mulberry gardens in Zhejiang Province are put into production, it is estimated that more than 54 million jin of liquor can be produced annually, saving 13.5 million jin of grain. Calculating the mulberry purchase price at 1.5 yuan per dan this year, the income of farmers in Zhejiang Province will increase by 1.95 million yuan; and there are also 650 million jin of mulberry wine lees that can be used as pig feed.
    In addition to increasing the quantity of mulberry wine brewed this year, the Zhejiang Provincial Company will continue to conduct research based on its 1954 experience and strive to improve the wine yield and quality. They proposed to brew as they collect and master the quality of the mulberries. According to the latest report from Nanxun Winery in Wuxing County on brewing mulberry white wine, the wine yield has increased from 5 jin of 46-proof white wine per 100 jin of mulberries in 1954 to 10 jin. At present, the Zhejiang Provincial Company is preparing to expand and add fruit juice presses and testing equipment in the spirit of thrift.

### 节约粮食，利用桑葚酿酒

    节约粮食，利用桑葚酿酒
    刘凡　正峰
    中国专卖事业公司浙江省公司（以下简称浙江省公司）利用桑葚酿制白酒、露酒已经成功。利用桑葚代替粮食酿酒，可以大大地减少粮食的消耗。浙江省公司一九五四年在嘉兴专区试酿一千多斤桑葚酒，每千斤桑葚酿的露酒，等于二百五十斤粮食酿的酒。今年他们决定扩大计划，酿制三万斤桑葚酒。
    根据化验，桑葚酿的酒，和一般粮食酿的酒没有大差异，它的酒精含量超过规格，含酸量很小，舌头已经感觉不出酸味。用桑葚酿的露酒，产品带紫红色，味甜，和葡萄酒相似，它比市场上出售的简装红葡萄酒的价格便宜很多，很受广大消费者欢迎。一九五四年中秋节，浙江省公司嘉兴支公司所属批发部开始试销，不到一星期就把试制的一千多斤“桑葚酒”全部卖完。群众纷纷要求继续供应。
    在桑葚酒的试制中，曾碰了许多困难。开始时，根据果木酒的酿造方法必须用酵母菌进行液体发酵，但没有酵母菌；加上一九五四年春季多雨，桑葚未采前受了雨打，果汁糖分减少，这样要影响酒的质量。浙江省公司商业组织技术科的工作人员针对这个问题进行了研究，结果用糯米和酒药酿制了酒母代替酵母菌；同时，酒母的含糖量也弥补了桑葚含糖量的不足。又如设备上的困难，他们没有酿制果木酒所用的果汁压榨机、高压杀菌机、冷却机、密闭发酵桶和过滤器等，更没有制果木酒所必需的化验设备。他们就想法利用嘉善、吴兴等地现有的黄白酒酿造设备。当桑葚汁和酒母混合发酵的同时作混成酒试验时，新的困难又来了，酒成了紫黑色，喝一口满牙满口都染上了黑色。桑葚究竟能不能做酒，职工们议论纷纷。最后，他们从实际的观察和参考果木酒酿制的有关书籍中，推断了桑葚酒发黑的原因是桑葚含有一种物质“单宁”，在用铁锅煎煮时起了化学作用，变成“单宁铁”。经过四五天发酵，色素逐渐下降。
    桑葚酒从做酒母、压榨桑葚汁、杀菌、混合发酵、压榨酒坯、澄清、煎煮、封坛等十多道操作以后制成了，并且安全地度过了夏天。
    以浙江主要蚕区吴兴、嘉兴、崇德等三十七个县统计，能产桑葚的桑园有一百三十一万亩；野桑更无法统计。吴兴县的二十一万一千四百二十亩桑园，以每亩种桑五十株、每株产桑葚二斤计，每年可产桑葚二千一百一十四万二千斤，如全部生产桑葚酒，能产露酒一千二百三十三万二千六百斤，可以节省粮食三百零八万三千多斤。如浙江省一百三十一万亩桑园的桑葚全部投入生产，估计每年产露酒五千四百多万斤，可以节约一千三百五十万斤粮食。桑葚以今年每担收购价格一元五角计算，浙江省农民的收入将增加一百九十五万元；还有六亿五千万斤的桑葚酒渣可以作养猪饲料。
    浙江省公司今年除了从酿桑葚酒的量方面扩增以外，并接受一九五四年的经验继续进行研究，努力提高出酒率和酒的质量。他们提出，随收随酿，掌握桑葚品质。根据吴兴县南浔酒厂最近酿制桑葚白酒的报告，出酒率已经从一九五四年每百斤桑葚出四十六度的白酒五斤提高到十斤。目前浙江省公司正本着节约的精神准备扩充和添制果汁压榨机和化验设备。
