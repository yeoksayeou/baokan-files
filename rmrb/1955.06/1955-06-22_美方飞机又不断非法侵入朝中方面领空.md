Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 21st – According to the Korean Central News Agency: At the meeting of the secretaries-general of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission held on the 20th, the secretary-general of the Korean-Chinese side, Senior Colonel Lu Yinxi, once again drew the U.S. side's attention to the continuous violations of the armistice agreement caused by the U.S. aircraft's intrusion into the airspace of the Korean-Chinese side. In the period from April 21st to June 15th, 1955 alone, there were as many as 25 incidents of U.S. aircraft illegally intruding into the airspace of the Korean-Chinese side.

At the same time, Senior Colonel Lu Yinxi demanded that the U.S. side punish the personnel involved in the above incidents and take appropriate measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

Also, at this secretary-general meeting, the U.S. side suggested that a staff officer meeting be held between the two sides in the future to discuss specific measures regarding the joint measurement of the incident area of the Gyeho-dong incident and the addition of markers on the military demarcation line. The Gyeho-dong incident was caused by U.S. armed agents illegally intruding into the vicinity of Gyeho-dong in Cheorwon County on June 2nd and attacking the Korean-Chinese side's civil police station.

    美方飞机又不断非法侵入朝中方面领空
    新华社平壤二十一日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：在二十日举行的军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长卢寅熙大校再次提请美国方面注意由于美方飞机侵入朝中方面领空而造成的不断违反停战协定的事件。单在一九五五年四月二十一日到六月十五日这一段时期，美国飞机非法侵入朝中方面领空的事件就达二十五件之多。
    卢寅熙大校同时要求美方惩办上述事件中的有关人员并且采取适当措施以防止再度发生类似事件。
    同时，在这次秘书长会议上，美方建议在以后举行一次双方的参谋官会议，以讨论关于双方共同测量桂湖洞事件的出事地区问题及在军事分界线上增设标志问题的具体措施。桂湖洞事件是由于美方武装特务于六月二日非法侵入铁原郡桂湖洞附近并且攻击朝中方面民政警察所造成的。
