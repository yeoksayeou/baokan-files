An Indian Art Seen by a Chinese Actor
Li Shaochun, Director of the Chinese Dramatists Association

In these few days, the Indian artists have performed many beautiful music and dance programs in our capital, allowing us to once again appreciate the superb music and dance art of our great neighbor. As a Chinese actor who once participated in the Chinese cultural delegation to India for a visiting performance, I have a special sense of intimacy.

The Indian artists' performance in Beijing reminded me once again of those unforgettable days in India.

All sixty-odd members of our delegation went to this beautiful country with a long-awaited and pleasant mood, bringing our own programs—more than thirty vocal performances, national instrumental music performances, dances, and Peking Opera. Among the Peking Opera programs we brought to perform, one was "Havoc in Heaven"—a section of the story of the Monkey King Sun Wukong from our classic masterpiece "Journey to the West."

The Indian people love and are very familiar with the story and performance programs about the Monkey King, because in Indian literature and various dramas, there is also a Monkey King—Hanuman. Although this is not the Chinese Monkey King—Sun Wukong, the image and heroic spirit of the two are similar.

As the actor playing the Monkey King Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West," I very much hoped to see the Monkey King Hanuman in an Indian dance drama. When I talked to Indian friends about this hope, they said, "Hanuman is a mythical figure most loved by the Indian people, and he is often performed in various dramas and dance dramas now. You will definitely have the opportunity to see it." They also told me: "The difference between Hanuman and Sun Wukong is: Sun Wukong likes to eat peaches, and Hanuman likes to eat bananas; Sun Wukong has no tail, and Hanuman's tail is very long. However, the Indian people and the Chinese people have the same feelings of loving these two witty and brave Monkey Kings." This further deepened my desire to see Hanuman. Later, I did see the Indian Monkey King—Hanuman—in Kathakali dance and shadow play.

Hanuman in Kathakali dance was played by the actor Kapina, and he performed very well. Like Peking Opera, he also drew a monkey's mouth on his face, painted some monkey hair on his face, and his upper body was naked, with some body hair appropriately painted on his skin.

In this dance drama, the story of Hanuman rescuing Rama's wife Sita is performed, which is the most exciting part of "Rama's Biography." The actor Kapina performed with great solemnity and weight. He didn't jump around like a typical monkey performance. Every movement had rhythm and strength, accurately reflecting Hanuman's bravery, wisdom, and enthusiasm in the stylized, rhythmic, and stylish movements and performance.

Hanuman is a protagonist in the oldest narrative poem in India, "Rama's Biography." "Rama's Biography" is a classical work from 2,500 years ago. Regarding Hanuman's magical deeds, Indians, young and old, love to talk about and listen to; his paintings are everywhere. In addition to "Rama's Biography," there is also "Hanuman's Legend," a drama dedicated to writing about Hanuman's miracles, which has been popular among the Indian people. In narrative poems and legends, Hanuman's supernatural powers are very similar to Sun Wukong's. This may be the result of mutual influence.

We also saw wonderful performances of Indian classical dance. The four types of Indian classical dance are: Kathak dance in the north, Bharatanatyam dance in the south, Manipuri dance in the northeast, and Kathakali dance in the south. These classical dances also have similarities with Chinese classical dance in terms of ideological content and artistic form. For example, Kathakali dance expresses ancient heroes slaying demons and eliminating harm for the people. This is similar to the theme of many programs in Chinese drama, reflecting the lives and aspirations of ancient people. The dance movements, gestures, eyes, and facial expressions of Kathakali dance have similarities with Chinese Peking Opera. Especially its facial makeup, which is also drawn in color, but it is not drawn by the actor himself, but the actor lies on the ground, and another actor draws it for him. It is drawn very carefully and takes a lot of time. There are also many dances that praise gods and heroes and depict the nature of all things, which also convey the ideals and moods of the ancient Indian people.

From these dances, we were deeply attracted by the beauty of the art created by the actors. The beautiful movements, the delicate performances, and the bright costumes all made people fascinated. Every move they made had a clear purpose, and all kinds of gestures had certain meanings, expressing a kind of power. Especially the foot bells during the dance, with their actions, showed various light, low, enthusiastic, and soft rhythms, which tightly grasped the ups and downs of the audience's emotions, so that the audience's mood was completely melted into the artistic realm they created.

I once met a female dancer and asked her to teach me Indian dance. She taught me two movements: she first gently pinched her fingers together with both hands and placed them in front of her chest, making a very graceful posture, and her eyes revealed a happy expression. This is "love." Then, she clapped her hands, raised her right hand high, pointed her left hand out with great weight, raised her left foot forward, moved her right foot backward, and looked forward powerfully. This is "strength."

"Love" and "strength" are the two basic movements of Indian dance, which is very meaningful. "Love" can generate "strength," which gave me a deeper understanding of the spirit of Indian dance.

There needs to be love between our people. Love mankind, love labor, love peace! Oppose aggression, oppose discrimination, oppose war!

There needs to be strength derived from this love between our people. This strength defends our friendship and defends the peace we all love!

During our traveling performances, we visited many scenic spots and historical sites, including the famous Taj Mahal.

We went in the early morning. In the hazy morning mist, the Taj Mahal, immersed in the morning mist, appeared extraordinarily beautiful and moving. The interior of the mausoleum is all marble walls, which are decorated with inlaid gemstone floral patterns, forming a quiet, bright, and magnificent aesthetic. The azure water in front of the mausoleum is like a pure and flawless sapphire, quietly revealing a fresh fragrance; the reflection of the Taj Mahal is reflected in the water, as dazzling as white jade.

We also visited the Ajanta Caves, which contain various postures of gods and fascinating murals. Indian friends told us: "The colors on the murals all have their symbolic meanings. For example, white symbolizes light, red symbolizes the sun, blue symbolizes the sky, and green symbolizes animals." These sculptures and paintings are very detailed and lifelike, giving great influence to Indian dance art. Many dance movements and postures are imitated from these sculptures and paintings.

These talented and exquisite arts surprised me and sincerely admired the wise and hardworking Indian people, and I still cannot forget them.

Outside the Ajanta Caves, an Indian friend pointed to a stone by the river and said: "More than 1,300 years ago, the Chinese monk Xuanzang came to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures and stepped ashore on this stone and arrived at the Ajanta Caves." It is said that Xuanzang stayed in one of the stone rooms in the cave!

Seeing this cave, I couldn't help but think of the stone carvings of Yungang in our country and the murals of Dunhuang. Our ancestors in both countries began cultural exchanges more than a thousand years ago, enriching each other's culture. Today, we are inheriting this spirit, making our two countries' cultural exchanges more abundant in content with the progress of history and with our two countries' peaceful coexistence in Asia and efforts for the cause of world peace.

With infinite nostalgia and admiration, I am writing this essay about what I saw and heard in our dear neighbor to serve as a welcome message to Indian friends who have come to China from afar. As I hold this pen and write each word, the faces of Indian friends and the warm friendship they gave us immediately appear in my mind. They stirred my heart, making me almost unable to describe those unforgettable days and the excitement deep in my heart.

### 一个中国演员所看到的印度艺术

    一个中国演员所看到的印度艺术
    中国戏剧家协会理事　李少春
    这几天，在我们的首都，印度的艺术家们演出了许多优美的音乐、舞蹈节目，使我们再一次欣赏到我们伟大的邻邦的精湛的音乐舞蹈艺术。而作为一个曾经参加中国文化代表团到印度去作访问演出的中国演员的我，更有一种特别亲切感。
    印度艺术家在北京的演出，使我再一次想起了我们在印度的那一些难忘的日子。
    我们代表团的全体六十几个人，都是怀着久已向往的、愉快的心情，带着自己的节目——三十几个声乐、民族器乐演奏、舞蹈和京剧，到这个美丽的国度去的。在我们带去演出的几个京剧节目中，有一个是“闹天宫”——我国古典名著“西游记”中猴王孙悟空的故事的一段。
    关于猴王的故事和演出节目，印度人民是非常喜爱、非常熟悉的，因为在印度的文学作品中和各种戏剧中，也有一个猴王—哈努曼。这虽不是中国的猴王—孙悟空，但二者的形象和英雄气概却是差不多的。
    扮演“西游记”中猴王孙悟空的我，是很希望能看到印度舞剧中的猴王哈努曼的。我和印度朋友谈到这个希望时，他们说：“哈努曼是印度人民最喜爱的一个神话人物，现在各种戏剧和舞剧里，时常演他。你一定会有机会看到的。”他们还告诉我：“哈努曼和孙悟空不同的地方是：孙悟空爱吃桃子，哈努曼爱吃香蕉；孙悟空没有尾巴，哈努曼的尾巴很长。可是印度人民和中国人民喜爱这两个又机智又勇敢的猴王的心情是相同的。”这更加加深了我想见到哈努曼的渴望。后来，我果然在卡塔卡利舞中和影子戏中看到了印度的猴王——哈努曼。
    卡塔卡利舞中的哈努曼是由演员喀皮纳扮演的，他表演得很好。也和京剧一样，他在脸上勾了一个猴子的嘴，脸上画些猴毛，上身是赤着的，在皮肤上适当地画了些汗毛。
    在这个舞剧里，演的是哈努曼去拯救拉麻的妻子西妲的故事，这是“拉麻传”中最精彩的一段，演员喀皮纳演得很凝重，很有分量。他不像一般演猴子的那样乱跳乱蹦，每一个动作，都有节奏，有力量，把哈努曼的勇敢、智慧、热情，准确地体现在那有程式有节奏有风格的动作和表演里了。
    哈努曼是印度最古老的叙事诗“拉麻传”里的一个主人公。“拉麻传”是两千五百年前的古典作品。关于哈努曼的神奇事迹，印度人不论老幼都爱说爱听；关于他的绘画，到处都有。除了“拉麻传”外，还有一部“哈努曼传奇”，是一部专写哈努曼奇迹的戏剧，一直流行在印度的民间。在叙事诗和传奇里，哈努曼的神通和孙悟空很相似。这也许是互相影响的结果。
    我们还看到了印度古典舞的精彩演出。印度的四种古典舞蹈是：北方的卡塔克舞，南方的巴拉达那蒂亚舞，东北的曼尼普利舞，南方的卡塔卡利舞。这些古典舞，在思想内容上、艺术形式上也和中国古典舞有相同之点。如卡塔卡利舞，表现古代英雄斩杀妖魔、为民除害。这和中国戏剧的许多节目的主题相似，同样是反映了古代人民的生活和愿望。卡塔卡利舞的舞蹈动作、手势、眼神和面部表情，同中国京剧都有相似的地方。尤其是它的脸谱，也是用彩色勾画的，但勾画的时候不是演员自己画，而是演员躺在地上，由另一个演员替他勾画，画得很精细，花的时间也多。还有许多歌颂神和英雄的舞蹈、描摹自然万物的舞蹈，也都传达了印度古代人民的理想和心情。
    从这些舞蹈中，我们深深地被演员们所创造的艺术的美所吸引了。优美的动作，精细的表演，鲜艳的服装，都使人神往不已。他们一举一动都有明确的目的性，各种各样的手势都有一定的含义，表示出一种力量。特别是舞蹈时的脚铃，随着动作表现出各种轻盈的、低沉的、热烈的、柔和的节奏，紧紧地掌握了观众感情的起伏，使观众的心情完全融化在他们所创造的艺术境界中了。
    我曾经会见了一位女舞蹈家，请她教给我印度舞蹈。她教我两个动作：她两手先将指头轻轻捏在一起，放在胸前，作了一个很优美的姿势，眼睛里流露出一种快乐的神情，这就是“爱”。然后，她两手一拍，右手高高抬起，左手很有份量地指出去，左脚向前抬起来，右脚向后搬，头昂然有力地向着前方，这就是“力量”。
    “爱”和“力量”作为印度舞蹈的两个基本动作，这是很有意义的。“爱”能产生“力量”，这使我对印度舞蹈的精神有了更深一层的体会。
    我们人民之间，需要爱。爱人类，爱劳动，爱和平！反对侵略，反对歧视，反对战争！
    我们人民之间，需要从这种爱所滋长的力量。这种力量捍卫着我们的友谊，捍卫着我们共同酷爱的和平！
    我们在旅行演出中，访问了许多名胜古迹，包括著名的塔姬·玛哈尔陵。
    我们是清晨去的，在迷蒙的晨雾中，塔姬·玛哈尔陵浸沉在朝雾里显得非凡的美丽动人。陵墓的内部都是大理石的墙壁，上面饰满了镶嵌宝石的花卉图案，构成了幽静、明朗、瑰丽的美感。陵前蔚蓝色的水，像一块纯洁无玭的蓝宝石，静静地透出清芬的气息；塔姬·玛哈尔陵的倒影映在水中，像白玉似地耀眼。
    我们还参观了阿旃陀石窟，石窟中有各种姿势的神像和引人入胜的壁画。印度朋友告诉我们：“壁画上的颜色，都有其象征意义。例如：白色象征光明，红色象征太阳，蓝色象征天空，绿色象征动物。”　　这些雕塑和绘画，都非常细致生动，栩栩如生，给予印度的舞蹈艺术很大的影响，许多舞蹈动作、姿势，就是从这些雕塑和绘画中摹拟而来的。
    这些天才的、精湛的艺术，使我感到惊奇，衷心地佩服着智慧、勤劳的印度人民，至今不能忘怀。
    在阿旃陀石窟外，一位印度朋友指着河边的一块石头说：“一千三百多年前，中国玄奘到印度来取经，曾踩着这块石头上岸，到了阿旃陀石窟。”据说不知道石窟里的哪一间石室，玄奘就在里面住宿过！
    看了这个石窟，我不禁联想起我国云冈的石刻和敦煌的壁画，我们两国的祖先，在一千多年前就开始了文化交流，丰富了彼此的文化。今天，我们正是继承着这种精神，使我们两国的文化交流，随着历史的前进，随着我们两国在亚洲的和平共处和对世界和平事业的努力，有了更丰富的内容。
    我怀着无限怀念思慕的心情，写着这篇关于我在亲爱的邻邦所见所闻的散记，来作为对远道来中国的印度朋友们的欢迎词。当我握着这支笔写着每个字的时候，我的心头眼底，立刻涌现出印度朋友的面影，和他们给予我们的热烈的友情。他们激动着我的心，使我几乎不知如何来记述那难忘的时日和那内心深处的激动。
