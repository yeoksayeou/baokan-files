    Close Connection Between Chinese and Indian Dramatic Arts
    Mei Lanfang, Director of the Chinese Opera Research Institute

    We watched the outstanding artistic performances of the Indian cultural delegation with excitement and pleasure. If its music is poetry, then its dance is the most beautiful flower.

    Faced with these dazzling programs, our first impression is that this is Indian national music and dance, that is to say, its national characteristics are distinct, strong, and complete. At the same time, we feel how close the Indian cultural art with its oriental sentiment is to our traditional national culture and art. We sincerely welcome the performance of the Indian cultural delegation, and we love these excellent artistic programs.

    The dances performed by Indian artists will forever leave us with wonderful memories. In all the dance programs I have seen, every one can be said to be perfect and moving. Judging from the appearance of Indian dance, whether it is dance of various schools or folk dance, each maintains its unique style and develops forward on the basis of the Indian national tradition, and the national flavor is calm and profound. The beautiful Indian dance art is not unfamiliar to us. We always feel that it is very similar to our classical drama in many aspects, which makes people feel particularly cordial. In my experience, Indian dance has reached an extremely high artistic level. Its expressiveness is very strong, but it is also very subtle. For example, "Bharatanatyam" has very complex and delicate dance postures and gestures, but every action has its purpose. In agile actions, it is always in sync with the beautiful music. Kathak dance is also like this. I like those subtle movements very much. The beautiful rhythm and poetic atmosphere deeply infect the audience. In particular, the use of the performer's forehand and backhand gestures reminds me of the "cloud hands" in our classical drama. I think that the dozens of rich and emotional hand gestures of Bharatanatyam and Kathak dance are worth learning from by our art circles. Also, the dance posture of the "Holi Dance" is exactly the same as the image of "Flying Apsaras" on the stone carvings of Tianlong Mountain and the murals of Dunhuang. Therefore, when we Chinese people see this kind of pure song and dance, it is like seeing an old friend. In this dance, the muscles of the whole body are completely relaxed, and only the muscles necessary to support the posture are locally appropriately tense, forming a beautiful rhythm. The dancer's emotions are like a thread, swaying through the whole body. Being able to quickly adjust the muscles in complex postures requires long-term training and a high degree of artistic accomplishment to reach this state. When the dance posture is in a static state, it can make the audience feel an internal rhythm, which is the most noble dance. In another type of singing (Song of the Bell Dance) and instrumental solo (Sitar Solo), there is also the same inherent natural rhythm. I don't know what the content of the song played by the sitar is, but I have a feeling of empty mountains, bright moon, and bells ringing outside the clouds. The two drums are like the sound of rain hitting lotus leaves, which is very quiet.

    The dance drama "Bestowal" is an outstanding program both in its theme and in its performing arts. This dance drama provides the very meaningful theme of good triumphing over evil, and it also centrally expresses the feelings of peace-loving people all over the world. When seeing the excellent performance of the Indian artist who plays the Demon King, I cannot help but recall the "Zhou Cang Slays the Fox" performed by our deceased famous actors Qian Jinfu and Fu Xiaoshan. This play also has the form of dance between two actors, such as the two people imitating each other's movements and expressing language in the movements, which are the same as the performance techniques of "Bestowal". Especially some of the body movements in "Bestowal", such as "tall and short pose," "three falling feet," "positive and negative cloud hands," and "inverted quick steps," are exactly the same as the body movements of the painted face role in Peking Opera. In terms of performance form, when the Demon King appears on stage with a red satin curtain covering his entire body, he shakes the red satin curtain with both hands at the stage entrance, slowly lowering it in a vibrating state to reveal his entire body, followed by a striking pose. This method is very similar to our Peking Opera's way of portraying demons appearing on stage, such as in the play "Golden Money Leopard"; especially the action of pointing both hands down, spreading the five fingers, and shaking them violently on both sides to express his fierceness, is also completely the same as the body movements of the painted face role in Peking Opera to express fierceness.

    The Indian national music with its unique style is beautiful, which is reflected in the harmonious and beautiful melody, and also in the peaceful posture of the performers sitting on the ground. In particular, the various forms of Indian musical instruments are admirable. In the musical accompaniment of our classical drama, the drum occupies a prominent position. Judging from the programs performed by the Indian cultural delegation, the drum also plays the same role, and its complex style and high level of percussion skills are worth our reference and learning from.

    According to legend, the performance of the "water cups" introduced from China to India, the performer conveys a sense of pleasure to us with a sonorous and melodious sound and a cadence of rhythm in the flexible use of both wrists like flying. I remember that in my youth, I heard the musician Mr. Chen Yanheng say this: Once he and my uncle Yutian went to a restaurant to eat, and the friends present said to my uncle, "You are a master of the erhu, but it is a pity that you did not bring the erhu today to ask you to perform." My uncle smiled and said, "Today I can change to another instrument and ask you for your advice." While he was talking, he picked up seven teacups from the table and placed them in front of him, and poured tea into them, with different depths of tea in the teacups. Then he gently tapped them with chopsticks, testing the pitch of the notes, and immediately formed a beautiful melody, with the prelude of the Xipi and Erhuang melodies, as well as tunes such as "Night Deep" and "Willows Swaying Gold." I only heard about this matter at the beginning, and did not witness it. Today I personally saw the Indian artist's performance of this "water cup", which aroused my memories of that year. I am even more grateful to the Indian artist for the precious friendship to the Chinese people in the "water cup" performance.

    Indian artists sang beautiful songs with natural and loud voices, such as the "Sino-Indian Friendship Song" which praised the friendship between the people of the two countries, which was full of emotion. The vivid and simple "Punjabi Song" expressed a side of the Indian people's enthusiasm and boldness with a strong folk color. In these songs, one can feel the Indian people's love of peace and spirit of optimism. The "Tagore's Ode," which is themed on praising the outstanding Indian writer Tagore, is full of noble feelings and is very moving. Mr. Tagore visited our country thirty years ago, and we met more than once in Beijing. His patriotism and spirit of striving for peace are still fresh in my memory. He watched my performance of "Luo Shen" and gave valuable advice. He also wrote a poem and painted a Chinese ink painting as a gift to me as a souvenir. More than 30 years later, this time from the singing of Indian artists, I once again recalled the voice and smile of this great patriot and our friendship. Under the reactionary rule of the old China in the past, the friendship and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Indian people could not but be hindered, but today this situation has completely changed due to the founding of New China, and an infinitely bright prospect has been opened up for the development of friendly cooperation between the two peoples. In this sense, I think it is also in line with Mr. Tagore's noble and kind wishes back then. The will he left behind will surely be fully carried forward in the new relationship between China and India.

    中印两国戏剧艺术密切相通
    中国戏曲研究院院长　梅兰芳
    我们满怀着兴奋愉快的心情，欣赏了印度文化代表团杰出的艺术表演，如果说它的音乐是诗，而舞蹈则是最美丽的花朵。
    在这些珠玉纷呈的节目面前，我们首先得到的一个印象是：这是印度民族的音乐、舞蹈，也就是说，它的民族色彩是鲜明的强烈的完整的。同时使我们感到，具有东方情调的印度文化艺术，和我国的传统的民族文化艺术又是多么接近。我们衷心地欢迎印度文化代表团的演出，对于这些优秀的艺术节目，我们是热爱的。
    印度艺术家所表演的舞蹈，将永远地为我们留下美妙的记忆。在我所看到的全部舞蹈节目中，可以说每一个节目都是完美的动人的。从印度舞蹈所已显示的面貌看来，不论是各种学派的或民间的舞蹈，都在印度民族传统的基础上，各自保持其独特的风格向前发展，民族风味沉着而深厚。优美的印度舞蹈艺术，对我们并不是陌生的。我们老是感到它在很多方面和我国的古典戏剧非常相似，因而使人感到格外亲切。在我的体会中，印度舞蹈已经达到了极高度的艺术境界，它的表现力很强，但又含蓄得很，例如“婆罗多舞”，舞姿和手势就是很复杂细腻的，但每一个动作都含有它的目的性，在灵活敏捷的行动中，处处和优美的音乐合拍，丝毫不紊。卡塔克舞也是这样的，我很喜欢那些细致入微的小动作，优美的节奏和诗意的气氛深深地感染着观众，特别是表演者正反手势的运用，使我联想到我国古典戏剧中的“云手”。我觉得，婆罗多舞和卡塔克舞，丰富而有情绪的几十种手势，都值得我国艺术界向她们学习。还有，“洒红节之舞”的舞态，同我国天龙山的石刻和敦煌壁画上“飞天”的形像一般无二，所以我们中国人一看这种清歌妙舞，简直如见故人。这种舞，周身的筋肉是完全松弛的，只有支持姿态所必需的筋肉，局部适当地紧张，成为优美的节奏。舞蹈者的情绪像一条线，摇漾地贯串着全身。在复杂的姿态中能迅速地调节筋肉，这是需要有长期的锻炼和高度的艺术修养，才能达到这种境界。当舞姿在静止状态时，能使观众觉得有一种内在的节奏，这是最高尚的舞蹈。在另外一种唱歌（铃舞之歌）和乐器独奏（锡达尔独奏），也有同样内在的自然的节奏。锡达尔所奏的曲子，我不知道是什么内容，但我有一种空山明月云外钟声的感觉，那两面鼓，仿佛雨打荷叶的声音，非常静穆。
    舞剧“赏赐”，不论在主题思想上和表演艺术上，都是杰出的节目。这个舞剧提供了很有意义的善良战胜邪恶的主题，它也集中地表现了全世界人民爱好和平的情感。看到饰魔王的印度艺术家的优秀表演时，不禁使我回忆我们的已故名演员钱金福和傅小山合演的周仓斩狐。这出戏也是两个演员对舞的形态，如两个人的动作互相摹拟和在动作中表示语言，都同“赏赐”表演的手法是相同的。尤其是“赏赐”里面有些身段类如“高矮像”、“三倒脚”、“反正云手”、“倒趋步”，简直同京剧架子花脸的身段是一样的。在表演形式方面，当魔王用一片红缎的帐幕挡住全身出场时，到台口用双手抖颤，将红缎帐幕在振动的状态中徐徐落下而露出全身，接着一个亮像，这种方式是同我们京剧表现妖魔出场，例如“金钱豹”等戏是非常相似的；尤其是双手朝下、五指张开、两边剧烈颤动的动作，表示他的凶猛，也同京剧花脸表现凶猛的身段完全一样。
    具有独特风格的印度民族音乐是优美的，这表现在和谐美妙的旋律上，也表现在演奏者席地而坐的安详姿态上，特别是印度乐器多种多样的形式令人赞赏。我国古典戏剧中的音乐伴奏，鼓是占有突出的地位的。从印度文化代表团演出的节目中看来，鼓也起着同样的作用，而且它的复杂的样式以及高度的敲击技术，是很值得我们参考借鉴的。
    传说由中国传入印度的“水杯”的演奏，表演者在灵活的两腕运用如飞之中，以铿锵悦耳的声音和抑扬顿挫的节奏传达给我们以快感。记得在我的少年时代，听见音乐家陈彦衡先生这样说：有一次他同我的伯父雨田到饭馆吃饭，在座的朋友们对我伯父说：“你是胡琴圣手，可惜今天没有带胡琴来请你表演一下。”我伯父笑着说：“今天我可以换一种乐器请你们指教。”他一边说着，一边就把桌子上的茶碗拿起七只摆在面前，随手斟上茶，茶碗里面的茶有深浅不同的程度，然后用筷子轻轻敲击着，试验音节的高低，立刻就构成美妙的旋律，有皮簧的过门以及“夜深沉”“柳摇金”等曲调。这件事我当初只是耳闻，并没有目睹，今天我亲眼看到印度艺术家的这种“水杯”演奏，引起我当年的回忆。我更加感谢印度艺术家在“水杯”演奏上对于中国人民珍贵的友谊。
    印度艺术家以自然的嘹亮的歌喉，唱出了优美的歌，像歌颂两国人民友谊的“印中友好歌”，充满了情感。生动而质朴的“旁遮普之歌”，以强烈的民间色彩表现了印度人民热情豪放性格的一面。在这些歌声里，使人体会到印度人民热爱和平和乐观主义的精神。以歌颂印度杰出的大文学家泰戈尔为主题的“泰戈尔的颂歌”洋溢着一种高尚的感情，使人十分感动。三十年前，泰戈尔先生曾经访问我国，我们在北京会见了不止一次。他的爱国主义和为和平而奋斗的精神气质，使我至今记忆犹新。他看过我表演的“洛神”，还提了宝贵的意见。并写了一首诗，画了一幅中国的水墨画赠给我作为纪念。事隔三十多年，这次从印度艺术家的歌声里，使我又回想起这位伟大的爱国者的声容笑貌和我们之间的友情。在过去旧中国反动统治之下，中印人民的友谊和文化交流是不能不受到阻碍的，但今天由于新中国的成立，这种情况已经完全改观，而且为发展两国人民友好合作展开了无限光辉的远景。在这个意义上，我觉得也符合于泰戈尔先生当年那种崇高善良的愿望。他所遗留下来的意志，必将在中印两国新的关系上得到充分的发扬。
