     “印度尼西亚新闻”认为
    美国没有理由留在台湾海峡
    新华社雅加达十三日电　“印度尼西亚新闻”十三日刊载一篇文章说：中华人民共和国已经表明了它有诚意来缓和台湾地区的紧张局势。但是，为了给谈判创造有利的气氛，诚意必须来自双方。文章说：美国没有理由留在台湾海峡。文章指出，蒋介石政权只是靠美国的支持才得以存在的。
    文章还要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。文章指出：美国不能忽视中华人民共和国在国际事务中所起的重要的和有决定意义的作用。
    新华社雅加达十四日电　“东星报”今天发表文章说：“关于台湾问题，目前存在的唯一问题就是美国的态度问题。”文章说：我们已经清楚看到中华人民共和国方面为了促进中美谈判所作的努力，但是从美国方面还看不到这种迹象。全世界的目光现在都注视着华盛顿。
    文章又说，现在是西方国家，特别是美国，来中止由于它早先的行动而在远东造成的紧张局势的时候了。“美国故意拖延解决台湾问题是完全没有道理的。”
    文章指出，如果美国不改变它对远东的政策，亚非国家的友谊和合作将造成一种局势，使西方国家不得不改变它们的态度。
