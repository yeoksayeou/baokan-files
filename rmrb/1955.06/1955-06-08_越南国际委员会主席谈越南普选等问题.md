Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 7th, the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam held a press conference in Saigon on May 31st.

On June 6th, the International Commission issued a communique in Hanoi, outlining the circumstances of this press conference held in Saigon.

Answering a question about the prospects for the 1956 Vietnamese general election, Desai referred to Article 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, according to which the responsible representative authorities of both zones should begin consultations on this issue on July 20, 1955.

In clarifying who are the responsible representative authorities, he referred to Article 14 of the Geneva Agreement, which stipulates that the civil administration of the northern and southern assembly zones of the temporary demarcation line shall be the responsibility of the party whose forces are assembled in that zone in accordance with the Geneva Agreement. He also referred to Article 27 of the Geneva Agreement, which stipulates that the signatories of the armistice agreement and their successors shall be responsible for ensuring the observance and implementation of all the provisions and regulations of the agreement.

Answering a question about the migration of residents, Desai said that all those who wish to live in another zone will continue to be granted permission and facilities to migrate to the zone of their choice, and this arrangement will continue until July 20, 1955. He said that the Commission will continue to monitor the actions taken by both sides during this period.

Answering a question about the Geneva Agreement prohibiting the entry of military personnel, weapons, and ammunition into Vietnam, Desai said that the arrangements by the International Commission’s fourteen fixed teams and two mobile teams to control the entry and exit of war materials are quite satisfactory at the current stage, and no violations of this provision of the agreement have occurred.

    新华社河内七日电　据越南通讯社七日讯：越南国际监督和监察委员会五月三十一日在西贡举行了一个记者招待会，国际委员会主席德赛答复了记者们所提出的若干问题。六月六日，国际委员会在河内发表公报，概述了在西贡举行的这个记者招待会的情况。
    德赛在回答关于一九五六年越南普选的前途问题时，提到日内瓦会议最后宣言第七条，按照这一条的规定，双方地区有代表性的负责当局应当就这个问题在一九五五年七月二十日开始进行协商。
    他在说明谁是有代表性的负责当局的问题时提到了日内瓦协定第十四条，这一条规定临时分界线北部和南部各集结区的民政由依照日内瓦协定而集结部队于该区的一方负责。他又提到日内瓦协定第二十七条，这一条规定停战协定的签署者及其职务的继承者均应负责保障对协定的各项条款和规定的遵守和实施。
    德赛在回答关于居民迁移的问题时说，所有那些希望到另一个地区去住的人将继续得到迁移到他们所选择的地区去的许可和便利，这个安排将继续到一九五五年七月二十日为止。他说，委员会将继续监察双方在此期间所采取的行动。
    德赛在回答关于日内瓦协定规定禁止把军事人员、武器和弹药运入越南的问题时说，国际委员会的十四个固定小组和两个机动小组控制战争物资的运入和运出的安排在目前阶段中是相当令人满意的，没有发生违反协定中这一规定的事件。
