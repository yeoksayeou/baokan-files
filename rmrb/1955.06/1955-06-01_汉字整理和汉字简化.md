Character Arrangement and Character Simplification
Ye Gongchuo, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee

Since the draft of the Chinese Character Simplification Plan was published, people from all walks of life across the country have engaged in enthusiastic discussions. The opinions raised during the discussions have been gradually compiled by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee. The results of the discussions show that the vast majority of people across the country agree with the general direction of Chinese character simplification (especially those engaged in teaching, writing, recording, copying, printing, and cultural work among workers, peasants, and soldiers, who almost unanimously welcome it), but they have some opinions on how to simplify individual characters and have put forward many valuable suggestions. This undoubtedly provides good help for the revision of the draft.

Indeed, we should carefully consider all aspects related to character arrangement in order to do a good job of simplification. Of course, simplification is still the initial work of arrangement.

The reasons why Chinese characters need to be arranged today have been discussed extensively in newspapers and periodicals, and there is no need to repeat those reasons now. What I want to say now is, first, that in order to comply with the development trend of Chinese characters themselves, it is necessary to carry out character arrangement and simplification. Chinese characters themselves, through countless evolutions, although there is also a trend of complication in order to distinguish the meanings of characters, the main aspect can be said to be advancing in the direction of simplification. This simplification is a inevitable trend driven by social development and popular demand. However, the ruling classes of past dynasties did not know how to comply with this trend to arrange the characters, and only knew how to stipulate that a certain type of font (such as regular script) must be used in certain occasions, and that there must be a certain number of strokes in certain occasions (such as the fonts used in memorials and examinations), which was called the standard form; otherwise, it would be called a variant, broken, or vulgar form, and a slight difference would be considered illegal. In fact, people of all classes at that time deeply suffered from such regulations. We have seen that many handwritten characters of famous people contain many variant, broken, or vulgar forms, or even create a kind of writing. As for the new writing created by the people, there are countless kinds, all of which are moving towards simplification. It can be seen that this trend of simplification is unstoppable. If we look at the changes from oracle bone inscriptions to bronze inscriptions, and from bronze inscriptions to seal script thousands of years ago, they have generally been dominated by this trend invisibly. Xu Shen said that Li Si and others created small seal script, "all taking the large seal script of Shi Zhou, or slightly simplifying and changing it," and simplification and change are obviously simplification. Comparing clerical script, cursive script, and small seal script, we can see more signs of simplification in structure or strokes. The evolution of cursive script and running script is also the same. Later, in the Five Dynasties and Northern Song Dynasty, regular script began to be used to print books, but simplified characters were also produced in the books at the same time. This was the case in the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, and even in the Liao and Jin Dynasties. Although the rulers did not recognize the legal status of simplified characters, the people still used them. Moreover, due to the needs of social development, the number of simplified characters increased day by day, so the rulers and the people, intellectuals and people with low cultural levels, almost did their own thing. Today, because social development is faster and the tools of cultural education are more convenient, and the original characters are not fully applicable, many temporarily created new characters have emerged (of course, some are very well made), which is not accidental. Therefore, how to understand this need and provide people with a better writing tool is really a responsibility of the country. Although this new tool is not easy to make, it must be made. Before this new tool is made, there must be a temporary emergency measure, which is to arrange Chinese characters, especially to simplify some Chinese characters first.

Secondly, the main purpose of Chinese character simplification is to solve the difficulty of recognizing and writing Chinese characters. Chinese characters generally have complex strokes, and most characters have more than twelve strokes, and some have twenty or thirty strokes. But no matter how many strokes there are, they must be squeezed into a square of the same size. For characters like "鑿籲鬱釁," it is not easy for children to even recognize their structure and strokes, and how is it possible to write them in a small square? For the sake of the next generation, simplification is necessary. A teacher said that the first lesson in the elementary school textbook, "School Starts," originally only had the character "了" that was easy to recognize and write. Now that it has been simplified, the characters "开学" are also easy to recognize and write, which is the happiness of the children.

Traditional characters are also inconvenient for ordinary people to write. In the cause of socialist construction, all departments must use writing. Writing traditional characters wastes a lot of time. Simplification can eliminate this waste and greatly improve work efficiency.

Is it a double burden to have traditional characters and also ask people to learn simplified characters? The original phenomenon was indeed a double burden, because when studying, one had to learn traditional characters, and when interacting with people in society, one had to learn the simplified characters popular in society. This is because the legal status of simplified characters was not recognized in the past, because the habit of writing among the masses is always to avoid difficulties and seek ease. We now want to fundamentally simplify printing, abolish the complex and preserve the simple, so that it is easy to unify handwriting with printing, which can eliminate the trouble of double burden.

Furthermore, Chinese character simplification also has the aspect of determining the shape and strokes of Chinese characters and streamlining the number of characters. In the past, among the Chinese characters that ordinary people called standard forms, the structure of the characters and the arrangement of strokes were still chaotic. For example, "毘" is also written as "毗," and "驗" is also written as "騐." It is difficult to distinguish whether it is one or two. Teachers also have to teach students several ways of writing. Also, the old Song typeface and the regular script are different in printing; the regular script and the handwritten regular script are also different. For example, the printed forms "遠" and "近" have one more stroke in the radicals than the regular script "遠" and "近." This kind of difference often makes beginners at a loss, not knowing which one to follow, and sometimes they even think they are two different characters. The existence of variant characters causes confusion in use. Often a manuscript is written inconsistently before and after, which adds a lot of trouble to the proofreading staff in order to unify the fonts.

Therefore, simplifying Chinese characters is not only to simplify their shapes, but also to simplify the number of characters, especially to delete those synonymous and synonymous variant characters and select only one to be used universally.

In terms of streamlining the number of characters, it is not only to eliminate variant characters. In the future, when arranging all commonly used characters, it is also necessary to clearly announce the cessation of using dead ancient characters in daily life, reduce unnecessary differentiated characters, and expand the common borrowing of some characters. Even in the first batch of simplified characters, the method of homophonic substitution has been adopted. This method simplifies the shape of the characters on the one hand, and streamlines the number of characters on the other hand. However, individual homophonic substitutions in the "draft" still need to be considered for deletion and revision.

There are many benefits to streamlining the number of characters, mainly because it can reduce the burden on children and illiterate people to learn characters, so that they can acquire reading ability more quickly. Secondly, for typesetting, typing, and coding, with a fixed vocabulary, much convenience can be added both in terms of saving materials and mastering technology. Compiling general dictionaries also avoids wasting space.

In order to eliminate the complicated and chaotic phenomena of Chinese characters, in order to reduce the trouble of learning and using Chinese characters, and in order to comply with the development trend of Chinese characters and the requirements of modern culture, Chinese character simplification is necessary.

However, on the other hand, we must also consider what difficulties there will be in Chinese character simplification. These difficulties can be summarized into the following points:

First, simplified characters destroy the tradition of Chinese characters. For example, the "铁" character, according to the Kangxi Dictionary, is the ancient form of the character "紩," pronounced zhì, meaning "to sew" or "to stitch," and it is wrong to use it as the "鐵" character. The "体" character was read like "笨" in ancient times, which is the "笨" character, and it is also wrong to use it as the "體" character. There are also some characters, such as "勸" which takes the sound from "雚," "鷄" which takes the sound from "奚," and "漢" which takes the sound from "?." The simplified characters are changed to "劝, 鸡, 汉," etc., and the phonetic components are all gone. Isn't this disrupting the tradition of Chinese characters? Chinese characters were originally created according to the rules of the six categories of Chinese characters, but after simplification, the rules of the six categories are destroyed. The original pictographic characters are no longer pictographic, and the phonetic characters are no longer phonetic.

A small part of the simplified characters do destroy the original system of Chinese characters, but this is an inevitable phenomenon in the process of reform, and it has been the case in the history of Chinese character evolution. For example, the "射" character in oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions depicts an arrow placed on a bow, with a hand pulling the bow waiting to fire. The small seal script changed it to "from body, from arrow," and the clerical script and regular script changed it again to "from body, from inch." Not only is it not pictographic, but even a little bit of the meaning of archery cannot be seen, so the person who tells jokes says that it was originally a "矮" character—a body one inch long is of course short—and it was used wrongly by others. The clerical script and regular script changed the round strokes of the seal script into squares, so "日" and "月" are completely unlike the sun and moon, and the wheels of "车" are also unlike wheels. Another example is the "贼" character, which in seal script is a phonetic character "from dagger-axe, from rule," but in clerical script, it becomes "from shell, from army," which obviously destroys the tradition. It can be seen that destroying the tradition of Chinese characters is nothing new. But in fact, the simplification of Chinese characters does not change much from the traditional regular script, and most of them still retain the original rules. For example, 喬 is simplified from 乔, then the right side of "橋" and "僑" is uniformly changed to 乔, which is still a phonetic character. The situation is exactly like this. Using "体" to replace "體" and using "铁" to replace "鐵" is also a new development of the rule of borrowing in the six categories of Chinese characters. It is like the character "我" in regular script, which in ancient times was originally a pictographic character representing a weapon, but later it was borrowed as a first-person pronoun. The original meanings of "体" and "铁" are no longer in use, so what is wrong with borrowing them as the simplified characters of "體" and "鐵"! (This is for those who study philology. In fact, the creators of simplified characters do not necessarily know that there were "铁" and "体" characters in the past. For example, the "体" character is derived from another simplified character of "體," "躰," which was originally a combined ideograph.) As for the fact that some simplified characters destroy the phonetic components of phonetic characters, this is of course a fact, but the phonetic components of many phonetic characters have long ceased to be the basis for pronunciation. It is often a joke to read half of the character, so there is no difference whether it is destroyed or not. That is to say, the original rules of the six categories of Chinese characters have often lost their value in practical use. But simplified characters can make it convenient for people to learn and use them, and they can save people time and labor. For the sake of these conveniences, sacrificing those six categories of Chinese characters that are not very useful cannot be said to be a miscalculation.

Second, some people think that simplified characters are not beautiful and not solemn. For example, simplifying the "華" character of the People's Republic of China into "华" is not solemn. Removing the "敢" character from the solemn "嚴" character is not beautiful, as if it cannot stand and is about to fall. But as far as we can see, there is no fixed standard for whether it looks good or not, it is entirely a matter of habit. In the past, ordinary people often used the "厂" character in their nicknames, and they did not feel that it was not beautiful, but rather that it was ancient and elegant. The "靴" character of boots and shoes was originally simplified from the "鞾" character, and no one said it was not solemn. Just talking about the name of the country, the "國" character of "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" used the simplified character "国." If they thought it was not solemn, they would not have used it. Usually, people write characters, and they are used to writing simplified characters, so they do not feel that simplified characters are not beautiful or not solemn, but if they are not used to seeing the simplified characters in printed matter, they feel that the simplified characters in printed matter are not beautiful or not solemn. If simplified characters are universally used in printed matter, and after seeing them for a while, getting used to them, they will not feel disgusted.

Third, some people think that there is too much simplification, and it is not easy to recognize them. People who originally knew how to read will become illiterate because of this. Or, people who have just learned to read and write will have to increase their learning burden because of the new simplified characters. From a certain point of view, these words seem to be correct, but we have to examine them comprehensively. Because simplified characters have always been mainly popular in handwriting, the degree of popularity often varies. Some simplified characters are very familiar to older people (such as 畬), while younger generations feel very unfamiliar. The "儒" character in "Confucianism" is generally written as "訏" in the south and "?" in the north, but these two characters are not recognized by each other in the north and south. Therefore, no matter which one of these two characters is specified to be used, some people will not recognize it. However, there are not many such characters. Also, the "遼" character in "Liaoning" is written as "辽," which is commonly used in the Northeast, and the "療" character in "convalescence" is written as "疗," which is commonly used in hospitals. People outside these areas may not be used to it. However, these kinds of characters are also easy to understand when used in words. The rest of the majority of simplified characters are commonly used by everyone, so there is no such thing as not recognizing them. As for people who already know how to read and have to learn simplified characters again, this is not a new thing. People who know how to read have to look at other people's handwritten things in addition to reading, so they inevitably have to come into contact with simplified characters, which makes them learn simplified characters sooner or later. Therefore, it cannot be said that the publication of simplified characters will increase people's learning burden. After the promotion of simplified characters, complex characters can be avoided to learn, but reduce the burden.

The above is an explanation of the difficulties in simplifying Chinese characters. From the perspective of the overall situation of simplified characters, although there are difficulties in the process, they are not very serious. There are also some views that, in principle, recognize the necessity of simplifying Chinese characters, but are not satisfied with this batch of simplified characters that have been published. The important ones are the following:

One opinion is that the simplification is too little and not thorough enough. This is indeed the case. But the work of simplifying Chinese characters cannot be completed at once, because both material and spiritual conditions are limited. The material difficulty is that it is not easy to modify the lead and copper molds used for printing at the same time. At present, the engraving of mold blanks has not been mechanized, and it must be done by hand, but there are very few skilled workers, and they cannot be trained in a short time. For each character that is changed, at least twenty or more copper molds of various fonts and sizes must be engraved. If many characters are changed in this way, the preparation time for printing will be longer. The spiritual difficulty is that new reading habits can only be developed slowly, part by part. If too many characters are changed at once, people will feel that there are many characters that they are not used to seeing and that are difficult to read, and they will develop a negative reaction to simplified characters. The fact that the simplification is not thorough enough, such as the fact that some radicals have not been simplified, is also related to this point, because often a change in a radical will affect many characters. In this way, we have to leave the simplification of this kind of radical to the second step to be gradually solved.

Another opinion is that the simplified characters themselves are not systematic, this character is simplified in this way, and that character is simplified in that way. For example, the character "鷄" is simplified to "鸡," but the character "溪" cannot be written as "汉"; the characters "勸" and "歡" are written as "劝" and "欢," but the character "灌" cannot be written as "汉"; the characters "難" and "漢" are written as "难" and "汉," but the character "歎" cannot be written as "欢"; the character "時" is written as "时," but the characters "詩" and "侍" cannot be written as "讨" and "付." This is without a system. According to systematic simplification methods, all the original identical radicals should be replaced with the same simplified forms. For example, the "冓" in "講、溝、購、構" must all be replaced with "井." If "井" is used in "講," but "勾" is used in "溝、購、構," then it should be considered disrupting the system. People who put forward this opinion naturally have their reasons, but the system of Chinese characters was originally chaotic. People who put forward the opinion are just afraid that people will not be able to learn traditional characters anymore after simplification, so they require the simplified characters and traditional characters to be systematically linked. He did not consider that in the future, except for a few people who specialize in studying old documents, ordinary people will not need to learn traditional characters; he did not consider that the radicals of phonetic characters are not completely useful for today's Chinese language, and some pronunciations that do not match can be changed appropriately during simplification.

Some people also admit that the old system of Chinese characters cannot be completely useful today and is quite chaotic, so they advocate thorough transformation, making all the shape and sound components of all phonetic characters rational and systematic. This ideal is very good, but it cannot be put into practice. The reason is that since the original system of existing Chinese characters is complex and chaotic, then if we want to sort out a completely rational new system from its old materials, its internal contradictions will be exposed and the establishment of the new system will be hindered. For example, it is not good that the "涼" character takes its sound from "京," so if it is changed to take its sound from "良," it becomes the "浪" character of "waves"; if the "浪" character of "waves" is not called to take its sound from "良," but is changed to use a radical that can better conform to the sound of the "浪" character, what about that? If we open the "National Pronunciation Commonly Used Characters Collection" and take a look, none of the single characters under the pronunciation of ㄌ尢, such as "狼郎蜋琅朗莨踉稂嫏…," is not derived from the sound of "良." It is very difficult to find another simple and rational phonetic component for the pronunciation of ㄌ尢. As far as the shape component is concerned, if it is considered that the "骄" of "proud" is now talking about people, not talking about the pride of horses (the original meaning is a six-foot-tall horse), and the "马" radical is to be replaced with the "人" radical, then there is no difference from the "侨" character of "overseas Chinese." Therefore, there are many difficulties in thoroughly transforming phonetic characters.

There is also an opinion that the current simplified characters are not simple enough, the handwritten form and the printed form are inconsistent, and they hope to simplify each character into a few strokes, and the writing and printing forms are the same. This opinion is also correct in theory. But it cannot be put into practice in fact. Because there are thousands of commonly used Chinese characters, if each character has only a few simple strokes, there will be many characters that look similar and are not easy to distinguish. Moreover, to achieve this point, we can only use cursive script and running script. Cursive script is a more difficult to recognize and write work of art, and of course it cannot be used in large quantities; running script does not have fixed strokes, and it cannot be used in general publications either, because if you use this kind of character that cannot be distinguished by strokes, things like dictionaries and codes cannot be arranged in order, and beginners have no way to learn. (Of course, it is no problem to make some cursive and running scripts into regular script as simplified characters.)

The above is some analysis of the content of Chinese character simplification. Overall, simplification should be feasible and necessary. At the same time, our subjective efforts, if we can use the simplification methods and steps appropriately, we can reduce the possible shortcomings to a minimum and expand the good side accordingly. Of course, it is the first thing to do to revise, add, and delete individual simplified characters in the draft based on the opinions of all parties, and eliminate the errors and contradictions in the draft. But this is only the beginning of the work. After we have done a good job of these hundreds of simplified characters and some variant characters, we must arrange all the modern commonly used Chinese characters, delete those that should be deleted but have not been deleted, simplify those that should be simplified but have not been simplified, and not let them slip through the net. The characters arranged in this way must conform to the principles of "precision" and "simplicity." Moreover, we must standardize the strokes of each character, so as to transform all the lead and copper molds. We also have to specify the standard pronunciation for each character, etc. This is the work of standardizing Chinese characters. The completion of this work will reduce many unnecessary difficulties in learning and using Chinese characters and increase its convenience. We are determined to complete the task of arranging Chinese characters in this way. We hope that people from all walks of life will put forward more opinions to guide us to continue to move forward!

    汉字整理和汉字简化
    中国文字改革委员会常务委员　叶恭绰
    汉字简化方案草案公布后，全国各地各方人士热烈讨论，讨论中提出的意见现已由中国文字改革委员会陆续整理。讨论的结果显示全国绝大多数人士对汉字简化的总方针是表示同意的（尤其是担任教课、编撰、记录、抄校、印刷和工农兵方面文化工作的，几乎是一致欢迎），但对个别的字如何简化则有些意见，并提出不少宝贵的建议。这无疑对草案的修正工作有很好的帮助。
    的确，我们对于有关汉字整理的各方面都应该考虑清楚，才能把简化工作做好。当然简化还是整理的初步工作。
    今天汉字需要整理的理由，报刊上已经说得很多，那些理由现在不必重复。现在想说的，第一点是，顺应汉字本身的发展趋势，必须进行汉字的整理和简化。汉字的本身，经无数次的演化，虽然为了区别字义，也有繁化的趋势，但主要的一面可说是循着简化的方向前进的。这种简化是由于社会发展和民众要求所促成的必然趋势。不过历代统治阶级不知道顺应这种趋势来整理文字，只知道规定某种场合必须用某种字体（如楷书），而且在一定的场合有一定的笔画（如奏疏考试等所用的字体），称为正体，不然便称为别体、破体、俗体，差一点点，便算违法。其实当时不论何种阶级的人，对这样的功令都是深以为苦的。我们看见不少有名的人的手写字，其中就有不少别体、破体、俗体，或竟臆造一种写法。至于民间新造的写法，更不知凡几，都是向简化这一条路走的。可知简化这一趋向是不可抑制的。我们试看几千年前由甲骨文到金文，由金文到篆书，大体上都已经无形中受这种趋向的支配。许慎说李斯等作小篆，“皆取史籕大篆，或颇省改”，省改就显然是简化。再拿隶书章草和小篆比较，更可看出结构或笔画的简化迹象，推之草书和行楷的演变，也是如此。之后，五代和北宋，开始用楷体刻印书籍，但书籍中同时即产生了简体字，由宋、元、明、清，即便辽金，也无不如此。尽管统治者不承认简化字的合法地位，而民间依然使用。而且因社会发展的需要，简化字日益加增，因此统治者和民众，知识分子和文化水准低的人们，几乎各干各的。到了今天，因为社会的发展更加快速，文化教育的工具更求便利，而原有的文字不完全适用，于是有不少临时创造的新字一拥而出（当然有造得很好的），这并不是偶然的。所以怎样了解这种需要，而给人民一种较好的文字工具，实在是国家的一项责任。虽然这种新工具不是容易做得出来的，但是必须做的。而没有做出这种新工具以前，不能不有一种暂时应急的办法，这就是整理汉字，尤其是先简化一部分汉字。
    其次，汉字简化的主要目的是要解除汉字难认难写的困难。汉字笔画一般是繁复的，大多数字在十二笔以上，多的到二、三十笔。但不论多少笔，都得挤在一个同样大小的方格里面，像“鑿籲鬱釁”一类的字，孩子们连辨认它们的结构和笔画都不容易，要把它们写在一个小方格内，怎么可能呢？为下一辈着想，简化是必要的。有位教师说，小学课本第一课“开学了”，原来只有一个“了”字好认好写，现在简化了，“开学”两字也好认好写了，这是孩子们的幸福。
    繁体字对于一般人写字也是不方便的。在社会主义建设事业中，各部门都不能不使用文字，写繁体字，要浪费多少时间，一简化就能把这种浪费免除，大大提高工作效率。
    有了繁体字还要叫人学简化字，是不是两重负担呢？原来的现象的确是两重负担，因为读书的时候要学繁体字，到社会上和人家交际，又不能不学社会上流行的简体字。这就因为以前不承认简体字的合法地位的原故，因为群众写字的习惯总是避难趋易的。我们现在要从印刷上根本简化，废繁存简，这就使印刷上手写上容易统一，可以解除两重负担的麻烦了。
    再则汉字简化还有厘定汉字字形、笔画和精简字数的一面。在过去一般人所谓正体的汉字中间，字形的结构和笔画的安排还是混乱的。比方“毘”又作“毗”、“驗”又作“騐”之类，究竟是一是二，很难区别。教员也得给学生教几种写法。还有印刷上老宋体和楷体字不一样；楷体字和手写楷体又不同，比方印刷体“遠”“近”，比楷体“遠”“近”偏旁多出一点，这种差别往往使得初学文化的人无所适从，不知道应照哪一种来写，有时候还以为是两个不同的字。异体字的存在造成使用上的混乱，往往一篇稿子，前后写的不一致，使得校对工作者为了统一字体平添多少麻烦。
    因此简化汉字不但是要简化它的字形，而且要简化字数，特别要删除那些同音同义骈枝异体的字，只选定一个来通用。
    就精简字数说，又不只是淘汰异体字，将来整理全部通用字的时候，还要明白宣布在日常生活中停止使用已死的古字，减少不必要的分化字，扩大一部分字的通借。就是第一批简化字中，也已经采用了同音代替的办法。这种办法，一方面简化字形，另方面就是精简字数。不过“草案”中个别同音代替的字还须考虑删改罢了。
    精简字数的好处很多，主要是可以减轻儿童和文盲识字的负担，使他们较快地获得阅读的能力。其次，对于排字、打字、编电码等，有了确定的字汇，无论在器材的节约上，在技术的掌握上，都可以增加许多的方便。编通用字典，也免得浪费篇幅。
    为了消除汉字繁杂混乱的现象，为了减轻学习汉字和使用汉字的麻烦，为了顺应汉字发展的趋势和现代文化的要求，汉字简化是必要的。
    可是另一方面，我们还要考虑汉字简化会有什么疑难之处。这些疑难处，归纳起来，约有这么几点：
    第一，简字破坏了汉字的传统。比方“铁”字，康熙字典上说，是“紩”字的古文，音秩，意思是“缝”或“纳”，俗用为“鐵”字，是错的。“体”字在古时候读如“笨”，就是“笨”字，俗用为“體”字，也是错的。还有些字，如“勸”从“雚”声，“鷄”从“奚”声，“漢”从“?”声，简字改为“劝、鸡、汉”等，声符都没有了。这不都是打乱了汉字传统吗？汉字本来是按照六书的规律造成的，简化以后，六书的规律就破坏了，原来的象形字不象形了，谐声字不谐声了。
    有一小部分简字，的确破坏了原来汉字的系统，但是这是改革过程中不可避免的现象，在汉字演变的历史上早就如此。如“射”字在甲骨文金文中是画着一支箭搭在弓上，有一只手引弓待发的样子，小篆把它改成从“身”从“矢”，隶书楷书再改成从“身”从“寸”，不但不象形，连一点射箭的意思都看不出来了，所以说笑话的人说它原来是个“矮”字——一寸长的身体当然是矮——被人家用错了。隶书楷书把篆书的圆形笔画都变成方形，于是“日”“月”完全不象太阳月亮的形，“车”的轮子也不象轮子了。又如“贼”字，在篆书里是“从戈、则声”的形声字，到了隶书，变成了从贝从戎，显然破坏了传统。可见破坏汉字传统，早就不是什么奇怪的事。但是事实上简化汉字对于繁体楷书的改变并不大，多数还保存原有的规律。如喬简从乔，则“橋”“僑”的右旁，统改成乔，仍是形声字。情形也正是这样。用“体”代“體”，用“铁”代“鐵”，也是六书中假借规律的新发展。好像楷书中的“我”字一样，在古代原是代表一种武器的象形字，后来却借作第一人称代词用了。“体”和“铁”的原义已经不通行，借作“體”和“鐵”的简字，有何不可！（这是替讲究文字学的人来说的，事实上创造简字的人不一定知道过去还有“铁”字“体”字，比方“体”字是“體”字的另一简字“躰”变来的，原是会意字。）至于某些简字破坏了形声字的声符，当然是事实，但许多形声字的声符早已不能作为读音的根据了，读半边字常常要闹笑话的，这样破坏不破坏，就没有什么分别。这就是说，原来的六书规律，在实用上往往失去了价值。但简体字是能使人们获得学习和使用上的方便的，是能使人们节省时间和劳动的。为了这些方便而牺牲了那些作用不大的六书规律，这总不能说是失算。
    第二，有些人以为简字不美观，不庄严。比方把中华人民共和国的“華”字简化成“华”字，就不庄严。把庄严的“嚴”字去掉那个“敢”字，就不美观，好像站不住脚，要倒的样子。可是据我们看来，好看不好看，并没有一定的标准，完全是习惯问题。过去一般人取别号，往往用个“厂”字，不觉得不美观，反而觉得古雅。靴鞋的“靴”字原是从“鞾”字简化而来，也没有人说不庄严。就说国名吧，“太平天国”的“國”字用了简字“国”，如果他们认为不庄严，就不会用了。平常人们写字，写惯了简字，不觉得简字不美观、不庄严，可是没有看惯印刷物的简字，就觉得印刷物的简字不美观、不庄严。如果印刷物上普遍用了简字，看了一些时候，看惯了，也就不会起反感了。
    第三，有人认为简化太多，不容易认识，本来识字的都要因此变成文盲了。或者说刚刚识字读书的人，因为新添了简字，又要增加学习负担了。从某一角度看来，这些话好像是对的，可是我们还得全面考察一下。因为简字向来主要在手写方面流行，普及的程度往往有差别。有些简字，年纪大的人很熟悉（例如?），而年青一辈觉得很生疏。“儒家”的
  “儒”字，南方一般写“訏”，北方一般写“?”，可是这两个字，南北互相不认识。因此在这两个字中，无论规定用哪一个，都会有一部分人不认识。不过这类的字并不多。还有，像“遼宁”的“遼”字作“辽”，是在东北通行的，“療养”的“療”字作“疗”，是在医院里通行的，在这些范围之外的人看起来也许不习惯。可是这类的字用在词儿里，也是一看就懂的。其余大多数的简字都是大家常用的，那就无所谓不认识的问题了。至于已经识字的人还要再学简字，这倒不是新鲜的事情，向来识字的人除了读书以外，还得看人家手写的东西，因此不可避免地要接触简字，这就使得他迟早要学简字了。所以不能说公布了简字就会增加人们学习上的负担。简字推行以后，繁字可以不学，反而要减轻负担了。
    以上是对于简化汉字疑难的解答。从整个简化字的情况看来，虽然进行中不是全无困难，但并不是很严重的。另外有一些看法，是原则上承认简化汉字的必要，但对公布的这批简字有些不满意。其中重要的有下面几种：
    一种意见是认为简化得太少，不彻底。这的确是事实。但汉字简化工作事实上不能一次完成，因为物质上和精神上的条件都有限制。物质上的困难是印刷用的铅字铜模不容易同时改制。目前刻制模坯还没有机械化，要用手工，但熟练工人很少，一时也培养不出来。每改一个字，各体各号铜模至少要刻二十几副。这样改的字多，印刷上准备的时间就要长。精神上的困难就是阅读的新习惯只能一部分一部分地慢慢养成，如果一次改得太多，人们觉得有很多字看起来不习惯，看起来吃力，就会对简化字发生反感。简化得不彻底，如某些偏旁没有简化，也和这一点有关，因为往往一个偏旁的改动，要牵动很多的字。这样我们就只好把这种偏旁的简化留待第二步去陆续解决了。
    另一种意见是认为简化的字本身不成体系，这个字这样简，那个字那样简。比方把“鷄”字简写成“鸡”，“溪”字却不能写成“汉”；把“勸”字“歡”字写成“劝”“欢”，“灌”字却不能写成“汉”；把“難”字“漢”字写成“难”“汉”，“歎”字却不能写成“欢”；把“時”字写成“时”，“詩”字“侍”字却不能写成“讨”“付”。这就是没有系统。依照有系统的简化方法来做，凡是原来相同的偏旁，都应该用相同的简化形式来代替。例如“講、溝、購、構”的“冓”都得用“井”代替，如果在“講”用“井”，而在“溝、購、構”用“勾”，那就要算打乱了系统。提出这种意见的人自然有他的道理，可是汉字的系统原来已经混乱，提意见的人只是怕简化以后，人们不容易再学繁体字了，所以要求简化字和繁体字有系统地联系起来。他没有考虑到将来除少数专门研究旧文献的人外，一般人是不需要学习繁体字的；他更没有考虑到，形声字的偏旁对于今天的汉语来说，并不完全管用，有些读音不符的在简化时是可以酌量改变一下的。
    也有人承认汉字的旧系统在今天已经不能完全管用，而且相当混乱，因而主张彻底改造，把全部形声字的形旁声旁都改得合理而有系统。这个理想很好，可是没法儿行通。原因是现有汉字原来的系统既然是复杂紊乱的，那末如果要就它的旧材料整理出一套完全合理的新系统来，它内部的矛盾就会暴露出来，而使新系统的建立受到阻碍。例如“涼”字从“京”声不好，把它改为从“良”声，就成了“波浪”的“浪”字；如果叫“波浪”的“浪”不从“良”声，而改用一个更能符合“浪”字的声音的偏旁，又怎么样呢？我们翻开“国音常用字汇”一看，ㄌ尢音下的单字如“狼郎蜋琅朗莨踉稂嫏……”没有一个字不是从“良”得声的，要给ㄌ尢音另找一个简单合理的声旁是很困难的。就形旁来说，假如认为“骄傲”的“骄”现在是讲人的事，不是讲马的高傲（原义是六尺高的马），要把“马”旁换成“人”旁，那就和“华侨”的“侨”字没有分别。所以彻底改造形声字，困难是很多的。
    还有一种意见，认为现在的简化字还不简单，手写体和印刷体不一致，希望把每个字简成几笔，写和印的形式一样。这个意见在理论上也不错。可是事实上行不通。因为通用的汉字有几千个之多，如果每个字都只有简单的几笔，就会有许多字形式相像，不容易分辨。而且要达到这一点，只好用草书、行书。草书是更难认难写的艺术品，当然无法大量采用；行书没有一定的笔画，在一般出版物上也是不能应用的，因为使用这种分不清笔画的字，字典和电码一类的东西就没法排次序，初学的人也无从学起。（当然，将一部分行草书加以楷化，作为简字，是没有问题的。）
    以上就汉字简化的内容作了一些分析。总起来看，简化这件事，大体应该是可行的需要的。同时我们的主观努力，要是对于简化的方式和步骤能运用恰当，就可以把可能发生的缺点减少到最小限度，而把好的一面相应地扩大。当然，根据各方面意见，把草案中个别简化字加以修订增删，消灭草案中的错误和矛盾，是首先应该做到的。但这不过是工作的开端。我们还得在搞好这几百个简字和一部分异体字的工作以后，整理现代通用的全部汉字，把其中应删而没有删的加以删除，应简化而没有简化的加以简化，不让它们漏网。这样整理过的字，必须符合“精”和“简”的原则。而且我们要给它每字的笔画定型，从而改造全部铅字铜模。还要给每个字规定标准音等。这是汉字规范化的工作，这个工作的完成对于汉字的学习和使用将要减少许多不必要的困难，增加了它的方便。我们决心这样来完成整理汉字的任务。希望各方面的人士多提意见，指导我们继续前进！
