The farmers of Aitouping Township, Zhijiang County, Hunan Province, have increased rice production by using the method of "trampling rice stubble seedlings." This method involves trampling green grass, green leaves, etc., into the fields after transplanting rice seedlings as a top dressing. This not only compensates for the lack of fertilizer but also improves the soil, reduces weeds, and increases drought resistance, which is very effective for increasing rice production. In 1954, Aitouping Township farmers harvested 459 jin of rice per mu by trampling rice stubble seedlings, which was more than 80 jin per mu more than in the past. This year, the farmers of Aitouping Township have already trampled rice stubble seedlings on 300 to 400 mu of land in an effort to harvest more grain. The Qianyang Commissioner's Office of Hunan Province Agricultural, Forestry and Water Conservancy Bureau has notified all localities to vigorously promote this experience.

    湖南黔阳专区推广“踩禾蔸秧草”经验
    湖南省芷江县艾头坪乡农民运用“踩禾蔸秧草”的办法，增产稻谷。这个办法就是在插秧以后，把青草、青叶等踩在田里，作追肥。这样做，不但可以补救肥料的不足，而且可以改良土壤、减少杂草，增加抗旱能力，对于稻谷的增产很有作用。一九五四年艾头坪乡农民因为踩了禾蔸秧草，每亩田收获四百五十九斤稻谷，比过去每亩多收八十多斤。今年艾头坪乡农民已经在三、四百亩田里踩了禾蔸秧草，争取多收粮食。湖南省黔阳专员公署农林水利局已通知各地，努力推广这个经验。
