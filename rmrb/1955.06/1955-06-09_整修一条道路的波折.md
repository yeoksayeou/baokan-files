    The Twists and Turns of Repairing a Road
    By Our Correspondent Chen Ji

    In front of the Changsha South Railway Station platform, a narrow crosswalk spanning four railway tracks connects the train station and the road leading to the city. The crosswalk is over three zhang (approximately 10 meters) long and only 1.2 meters wide. At the beginning of the crosswalk is a steep slope, making it difficult to control handcarts rushing down. At the other end is the road, where the paving of cinders and dirt has gradually collapsed, forming small pits. The uneven sleepers laid on the crosswalk have been pressed into deep and shallow longitudinal grooves by the wheels. This dilapidated and narrow crosswalk is a vital point for the entry and exit of large quantities of materials at Changsha South Station. Five to six hundred handcarts loaded with materials pass through here every day. The crosswalk can only accommodate one handcart at a time. Handcarts transporting materials back and forth often queue up like long snakes at both ends of the crosswalk, sometimes waiting for an hour before anxiously passing through. On March 4th of this year, when porter Liu Mingsheng pulled his handcart across, the wheel suddenly slipped into a pit, and he fell with the cart. The large bags of corn on the cart rolled onto his head and back, crushing his neck bones. He died in the hospital the next day.

    According to a staff member of the Changsha City Transportation Company, more than 30 work-related injuries have occurred here in the past year, damaging a lot of state property. The Changsha City Transportation Company alone has paid more than 3,000 yuan in work-related injury medical expenses, etc. Workers are afraid of this crosswalk, calling it the "Bridge of Helplessness."

    However, this crosswalk is under the jurisdiction of the railway bureau, and the railway bureau should be responsible for repairing it.

    A year ago, the Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Railway Administration and the Secretary of the CPC Zhuzhou Railway Branch Bureau came to Changsha together. The Changsha City Transportation Company suggested to them that they should quickly repair the crosswalk. They said, "We'll study it and get back to you." Several months passed, and the transportation company received no reply. In September and October of last year, they sent a formal letter to the Zhuzhou Railway Branch Bureau, requesting a swift resolution to the crosswalk problem, and also sent Fan Duanqing, a staff member from the labor protection section, to Zhuzhou Branch Bureau to negotiate. Initially, the director refused to meet, and instead sent two section chiefs to talk with Fan Duanqing. The conclusion was: "We must ask for instructions from the higher authorities." Later, Fan Duanqing met with the director, Du Fuxing. After repeated requests, Director Du promised to personally come to Changsha in four or five days to jointly resolve the issue with relevant units. However, four or five days passed, and Director Du did not come, nor did he send any reply. Just as people were feeling strange, the Chief Engineer of the Zhuzhou Railway Branch Bureau came to Changsha to test methods of loading cotton. The transportation company again consulted with the Chief Engineer, who promised to study the matter upon returning to the bureau. On November 23rd, the Zhuzhou Branch Bureau sent a letter stating that a new crosswalk would be built to the north of the existing one, with construction starting in January of this year, in order to eliminate the congestion on the existing crosswalk. However, before long, they changed their minds again. Because building a new crosswalk would require adding four watchmen and setting up gates. The Zhuzhou Railway Branch Bureau would have to ask the Guangzhou Railway Administration about this issue.

    It cannot be said that the Guangzhou Railway Administration does not value this issue. The engineering department of this bureau sent a staff member to Nan Station to investigate. However, this staff member did not ask the workers on the scene or inquire about the transportation situation here. He just took a cursory look. He described the crosswalk, which had several hundred handcarts and hundreds of porters passing through it every day, as “not having many pedestrians, only some coal carts passing through here.” His conclusion was that it was unnecessary to repair the crosswalk.

    This erroneous conclusion immediately took effect. Leading staff members of the Guangzhou Railway Administration sent a telegram to the Zhuzhou Branch Bureau on February 10th, disagreeing with building a new crosswalk and setting up watchmen.

    The Changsha City Transportation Company again raised its concerns with the railway bureau. But still, there were no results. The matter dragged on until March 4th of this year, when the unfortunate accident of worker Liu Mingsheng's death occurred. Seeing that the problem was too serious, the transportation company wrote a letter on March 12th to the Guangzhou Railway Administration, and also sent copies to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Labor, demanding that this issue be resolved quickly. In order to protect worker safety, the Changsha City Labor Bureau convened a meeting of relevant departments to specifically discuss the crosswalk problem and proposed specific measures to improve the crosswalk. On May 16th, they sent a letter to the Guangzhou Railway Administration, hoping for a swift reply. Changsha South Station also verbally reported the matter to staff members of various departments of the Zhuzhou Branch Bureau more than ten times, demanding a quick resolution. However, they still received no response. Now, we ask the Guangzhou Railway Administration and other relevant leading personnel, when are you planning to solve this problem?

    整修一条道路的波折
    本报记者　陈迹
    在长沙南站站台前面，一条跨过四条火车股道的狭窄的横道，连结着火车站和通往市区的马路。横道有三丈多长，只有一点二公尺宽。横道前头是个陡坡，板车从上面冲下来，很难控制住。横道另一头是马路，铺路的煤碴和泥土渐渐陷落，形成一个个小坑洞。横道上面铺的凸凹不平的枕木，已被车轮压成一道道深浅不一的纵沟。这条残破的狭小的横道，却是长沙南站大批物资出入的要孔。每天五、六百辆板车载满物资，从这里通过。横道只能通过一辆板车。来回运送物资的板车，常常长蛇般地在横道两头排队等待，有时等上一个钟头，才能非常紧张地通过。今年三月四日，搬运工人刘明胜拉板车过来，车轮忽然滑进坑洞，人随车倒，车上的大包谷子滚到他头上背上，把他颈骨压坏，送到医院的第二天就死了。
    据长沙市搬运公司的一个工作人员说，一年多来在这里发生过三十多次工伤事故，损坏了国家的好多货物。长沙市搬运公司单是付出的工伤医疗费等等，就有三千多元。工人都害怕这条横道，说它是“奈河桥”。
    但这条横道归铁路局方面管，修建这条横道，也应该由铁路局方面负责。
    一年以前，广州铁路管理局副局长和中共株州铁路分局党委书记，一同来长沙。长沙市搬运公司就向他们建议，赶快整修横道。他们说：研究一下，再说。隔了好几个月，搬运公司不见他们回答，又于去年九、十月份写了正式公函，请求株州铁路分局迅速解决横道的问题，还派了劳保科工作人员范端青到株州分局交涉。起先局长不接见，叫两个科长跟范端青谈话。结论是：“必须请示上级”。后来，范端青又见到了局长，局长杜福兴在一再请求下，答应过四、五天亲自到长沙和有关单位共同解决这个问题。可是，四、五天过去了，杜局长没有来，也没有什么答复。人们正在感到奇怪的时候，株州铁路分局来了个总工程师，他是来长沙试验棉花装载的方法的。搬运公司又找这位总工程师商量。总工程师答应回局再研究。到了十一月二十三日，株州分局来了个公函，说是在横道北边增修一条横道，今年一月着手动工，以便消除现有横道的拥挤现象。但是没有多久，又变了卦。因为增修横道，就得增加四个看守员和设置栅门。这个问题，株州铁路分局还得请示广州铁路管理局。
    不能说广州铁路管理局不重视这个问题。这个局的工务部门派了个工作人员来南站调查。但是这位工作人员不问问现场工人，也不打听这里的运输情况，只走马观花地看了看。把这条每天有好几百辆板车、好几百搬运工人通过的横道，说成是
  “行人不多，只有一些运煤的板车在这里通过。”他的结论是不必修建这条横道。
    这个错误的结论马上发生作用。广州铁路管理局的领导工作人员，在今年二月十日给株州分局打了个电报，不同意再增修横道和设置看守人员。
    长沙市搬运公司又向铁路局方面提了意见。但还是没有结果，拖到今年三月四日，发生了工人刘明胜死亡的不幸事故。搬运公司眼看问题太严重，在三月十二日写出公函，给广州铁路管理局，并抄送给中央铁道部、劳动部，要求赶快处理这个问题。长沙市劳动局为了卫护工人安全，召集有关部门开会，专门讨论横道问题，并提出具体的改善横道的办法，在五月十六日函告广州铁路管理局，希望迅速答复。长沙南站也口头向株州分局各部门工作人员反映十多次，要求急速解决。但是，还是得不到任何答复。现在，请问广州铁路管理局等有关的领导人员，打算到什么时候才解决这个问题呢？
