Learning to Struggle Against All Hidden Enemies from the Hu Feng Incident
    Ji Wenfu

    After the third batch of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was published in the "People's Daily," the true face of Hu Feng and his followers was completely exposed. As the "Editor's Note" and editorial of the "People's Daily" on June 10th pointed out, these organizers of literary work who stood around the Party, and the "revolutionary writers who had pursued revolution for more than ten years," turned out to be "people with ulterior motives"! "Imperialist Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, defectors, and turncoats were the basic backbone of this group." This further proves that Hu Feng and many key members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group were a group of counter-revolutionary elements closely linked to imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang.

    In recent years, everyone has been immersed in construction work. On all fronts, one victory after another has been achieved. Therefore, everyone has been intoxicated with the joy of victory, diluting or even losing their awareness of the enemy's situation, to the point where they sometimes "sleep with tigers" without realizing it! However, class enemies have not been sleeping, and the struggle has been continuous, only taking on new forms under new circumstances. You see, the armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, since being annihilated on the mainland, have adopted other methods to struggle, such as: sending secret agents, airdropping secret agents, buying off informants, etc., constantly looking for opportunities to establish underground bases and carry out sabotage. The method of the Hu Feng group, infiltrating revolutionary organizations, even penetrating the Party's organization, and "worming their way into our bellies," is one of the most prominent, cunning, and insidious tricks played by the enemy. Based on the counter-revolutionary activity cases we have cracked and exposed in the past, we have become clear that no matter what kind of counter-revolutionary organization or counter-revolutionary element, they are all connected to the US-Chiang Kai-shek gang, and they very much "understand some counter-revolutionary underground work tactics." Look, aren't the key members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, whose true colors we have now exposed, all reactionary guys closely linked to imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang? Didn't they deeply understand that "a naked attack is not our tactic" and that "we must not easily...start shooting before the position is fortified"? Didn't they also understand that "struggle requires energy and tactics. All the trivial matters outside the principles should be considered within the scope of tactics"? This shows that in the new situation and new struggle, the enemy is also playing new tricks. This is not like fighting the War of Liberation, where on the battlefield, it was guns against guns and cannons against cannons, and the enemy was visible to the eye. "It is easy to dodge a spear in the open, but hard to guard against an arrow in the dark." From the Hu Feng incident, we can know that not only must we constantly heighten our vigilance, but we must also improve our ability to distinguish between friend and foe, and learn the ability to fight against all hidden enemies. All hidden enemies, no matter how well they understand "struggle tactics" or how much they emphasize "methods," will inevitably reveal their true colors in the end. Under the leadership of the Party, we must launch a broadest, mass-based suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and drag out all hidden counter-revolutionary elements from every corner and from under all disguises, and thoroughly eliminate them. Millions of eyes and millions of hands, like a net spread across the sky, will see where these reactionary guys can escape!

    从胡风事件中学习对一切暗藏敌人作斗争
    嵇文甫
    关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料在“人民日报”上公布以后，胡风和胡风分子的真面目，已经是原形毕露。正如六月十日“人民日报”的“编者按”和社论所指出的，这一批站在党的周围的文学工作的组织者，以及“追求革命十多年的革命作家”，原来“都是别有来历的人物”！“帝国主义国民党特务分子，反动军官，托洛茨基分子，革命叛徒，自首变节分子，就是这个集团的基本骨干。”这已经进一步证明胡风和胡风反革命集团中的许多骨干分子是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的一群反革命分子了。
    近几年以来，大家埋头于建设工作。在各个战线上，一个胜利接着一个胜利，因此，大家便陶醉在胜利的欢欣中，而把敌情观念冲淡，甚至是丧失掉了，弄得有时“同老虎睡在一起”而不自知！但是，阶级敌人却并没有睡觉，斗争是在一直持续着的，只不过是在新的形势下，采取着新的花样罢了。你看，蒋匪帮的武装，自从在大陆上被消灭以后，却采取了另外的方式来进行挣扎，如大家所知道的：派遣特务，空投特务，收买坐探等等，随时随地找空子，企图建立地下阵地，进行破坏。胡风集团这种混进革命团体，甚至打入了党的组织，“钻进肚皮去”的手法，就是敌人所耍的种种花样中的最突出、最狡猾、最阴险的一个。根据以往我们所破获、所揭露出来的反革命活动案件，我们弄清楚了，不管什么样的反革命组织，什么样的反革命分子，他们总都是条条线索通美蒋，并且他们非常“懂得一些反革命的地下工作的策略”。你看，这一次被我们揭出真面目来的胡风及其反革命集团里的骨干分子，不都是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的反动家伙吗？他们不是深深懂得“赤膊上阵不是我们底战术”，“不能轻易地，……在阵地未强固前就放起枪来”吗？他们不是也了解“斗争是要精力的，要讲究策略的。在原则以外的一些枝节都应该放在策略范围以内来考虑”吗？这说明新的形势，新的斗争情况，敌人也在耍着新的花样。这不像进行解放战争，在阵地上，枪对枪，炮对炮，敌人在哪里，放眼可以瞅着。“明枪易躲，暗箭难防”，从胡风事件中，我们可以知道，不仅要时时提高警惕，同时还得提高我们辨别敌友的能力，学会同一切暗藏敌人作斗争的本领。一切暗藏的敌人，不管他们如何懂得“斗争的策略”，如何讲究“方法”，但终究必然会露出马脚来。我们要在党的领导下，开展一个最广泛的、群众性的镇压反革命运动，从各个角落里，各种伪装下，把一切暗藏的反革命分子抓出来，予以彻底清除。千万只眼睛，千万只手，如同张起了一个天罗地网，看这些反动家伙们往哪里逃走！
