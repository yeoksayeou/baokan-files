The counties around Dongting Lake Prepare for Flood Prevention

Recently, Hunan Province has been experiencing continuous rainfall, causing the Xiang River, Zi River, Yuan River, and Li River to rise universally, and the water levels in the Dongting Lake area and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have also risen. The counties along the shores of Dongting Lake have established levee protection headquarters and are actively preparing for flood prevention. Yueyang, Xiangyin, Hanshou and other counties have recently held flood prevention technology meetings and criticized the current slack and麻痹 emotions of some staff members. Xiangyin County issued instructions on May 23, requiring all localities to quickly check the hidden dangers of levees. Hanshou County has organized teams to protect levees without hindering rice transplanting. The Changde area has mined more than 80,000 cubic meters of block stone and transported them to the construction site for slope protection. More than 390 civilian workers in Nanxian County went to the embankment to protect the slope and have completed more than 3,000 square meters of stone masonry work. (Our correspondent in Changsha)

    洞庭湖滨湖各县准备防汛
    湖南省近来不断落雨，湘江、资水、沅水和澧水普遍上涨，洞庭湖区和长江中游水位也上升。洞庭湖边各县已成立堤垸防护指挥部，积极准备防汛。岳阳、湘阴、汉寿等县都在最近召开防汛技术会议，并批判目前部分工作人员的松懈麻痹情绪。湘阴县在五月二十三日发出指示，要求各地迅速检查堤垸隐患。汉寿县在不妨碍插秧的情况下，组织了防护堤垸的队伍。常德专区已开采块石八万多方，运往工地护坡。南县三百九十多个民工上堤护坡，已完成三千多平方公尺的砌石工程。                          （本报驻长沙记者）
