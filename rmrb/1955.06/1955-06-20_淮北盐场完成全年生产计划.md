The state-owned Huaibei Salt Field had, by June 14th, completed 100.52% of its annual production plan.

"Spring Sweep" is the main production season for the Huaibei Salt Field. The Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau required all employees to complete 90% of the annual plan during the "Spring Sweep". All employees seized the favorable opportunity of sunny weather, actively carried out competitions, and adopted important measures such as improving evaporation and enriching brine sources. For example, Zhao Shaoren and other workers from the 11th working area of the 2nd Salt Factory created a method of uniformly using good water and cultivating the bottom of the pond, adding seven more salt pans and increasing production by more than 400 dan of salt. After the launch of working area competitions, the 29th working area of the 7th Salt Factory solved the problem of untimely brine extraction and overfulfilled the plan.

Currently, the Huaibei Salt Field Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau are calling on all employees to strive to prevent complacency and slackening, continue to learn and promote advanced experience, strengthen salt protection, prevent dilution, protect brine, and strive to produce more salt for the country.

    淮北盐场完成全年生产计划
    国营淮北盐场到六月十四日止，已经完成了全年生产计划的百分之一百点五二。
      “春扫”，是淮北盐场主要生产季节。淮北盐务管理局要求全场职工在“春扫”中完成全年计划的百分之九十。全体职工在“春扫”中，抓紧天气晴朗的有利时机，积极开展竞赛，采取了提高蒸发、充实卤源等重要措施。如第二制盐场十一工区工人赵绍仁等，创造统一使用好水及沤塘底的办法，多添了七块晒格，增产四百多担盐。开展工区竞赛以后，第七制盐场二十九工区解决了出卤不及时的问题，超额完成了计划。
    现在，中共淮北盐场委员会和淮北盐务管理局又号召全场职工，努力防止自满松懈情绪，继续学习并推广先进经验，加强保盐、防淡、保卤等工作，争取为国家生产更多的盐。
