Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 14th: According to the Vietnam News Agency: On June 12th, Vice Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, speaking to over six hundred intellectuals and senior officials of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, said: Holding a consultative conference to prepare for the completion of national unification through general elections is the most important issue currently facing the entire Vietnamese people.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that the Geneva Accords restored peace to Vietnam on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the Vietnamese people, namely sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. This forms the legal basis for the current struggle of the Vietnamese people for unification.

Pham Van Dong recounted the conspiracies of the United States since the convening of the Geneva Conference to undermine peace and unification in Vietnam, saying: The Vietnamese people are not relaxing their vigilance. The Vietnamese people are working hard to consolidate North Vietnam, which is the solid foundation and pillar of the entire Vietnamese people, and the hope of our southern compatriots.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that it is necessary to unite all forces advocating peace and unification, regardless of social class, political affiliation, or religious belief. He pointed out that the consultative conference must be held on schedule on July 20th in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    范文同副总理号召按期举行越南协商会议
    新华社河内十四日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国副总理范文同十二日在向六百多名知识分子和越南民主共和国政府高级官员讲话时说：举行协商会议以准备通过普选完成国家的统一，是全体越南人民当前最重要的问题。
    范文同指出，日内瓦协定在承认越南人民的民族权利，即主权、独立和领土完整的基础上恢复了越南的和平。这构成了越南人民目前争取统一的斗争的法律基础。
    范文同追述了美国从日内瓦会议召开以来所进行的破坏越南和平和统一的阴谋，他说：越南人民不放松他们的警惕。越南人民正在努力巩固北越，这是全体越南人民的坚固基础和支柱，我们南部同胞的希望。
      范文同指出，必须不分社会阶层、政治关系或宗教信仰，团结一切主张和平和统一的力量。他指出，必须按照日内瓦协定的规定，在七月二十日准期举行协商会议。
