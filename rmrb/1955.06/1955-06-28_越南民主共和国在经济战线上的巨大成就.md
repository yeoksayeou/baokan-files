Great Achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Economic Front
Zhou Xiuqing

Since the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the people of the Republic,under the wise leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam,and President Hồ Chí Minh, have not only won brilliant victories militarily, but have also made great achievements in other aspects. After the restoration of peace in Indochina, the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam displayed a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm, actively healed the wounds of war, and rapidly restored and developed the national economy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Vietnam is a country with fertile land and abundant resources. However, in the past, under the rule of French colonialists and domestic landlord class, the lives of the people were extremely impoverished. Before the August Revolution, the landlord class and French colonialists, who accounted for less than 5 percent of the population, occupied more than 75 percent of the land; while the vast majority of peasants, who accounted for about 90 percent of the total population of Vietnam, only owned about 25 percent of the land, mostly barren. Among the more than four million peasant households in Vietnam, more than half—2,123,200 households—were landless or had very little land. Landlords and French colonialists extracted 70 to 80 percent of the harvest from the peasants every year.

After the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, a series of measures were implemented to improve the conditions of the peasants and develop agricultural production. Since 1945, the People's Government has successively promulgated decrees on rent reduction and interest reduction. In May 1953, President Hồ Chí Minh issued an order to confiscate land originally belonging to French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors, as well as to requisition ownerless land, and temporarily distribute these lands to landless or land-poor peasants. These measures were warmly welcomed by the vast majority of peasants.

In December 1953, in accordance with the land reform program of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam adopted and the government promulgated the historic Land Reform Law. In early 1954, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government, land reform was implemented in a planned and step-by-step manner in vast rural areas, achieving significant victories. According to statistics, after seven phases of rent reduction and three phases of land reform, rent had been reduced in areas with a population of 5.67 million in northern Vietnam, and land reform had been completed in areas with a population of 1.98 million.

In the countryside after the land reform, the political power of the landlord class has been completely crushed. The peasants have become the masters of their own land, their lives have been guaranteed and are improving day by day. A thriving scene has generally emerged in the countryside.

After the restoration of peace, Vietnam's agricultural production has further increased. The cultivated area of land has been expanding year by year, and the yield of crops has been increasing day by day. This year, in the left bank area of the Red River in Vietnam, Thái Bình province alone has expanded the cultivated area of summer rice from 20,000 hectares to more than 83,000 hectares. In the suburbs of Hanoi, rice fields that yielded less than 200 kilograms per *yue mu* (one *yue mu* equals 5.5 Chinese *mu*) during the French colonial rule have reached a yield of 700 to 800 kilograms this year. The ten policies on encouraging agricultural production promulgated by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on June 30, 1954, are an important factor in promoting the increase of agricultural production.

The main task of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in agricultural production in 1955-56 is to restore grain production to pre-war levels. The successful completion of this task will greatly promote the development of the entire national economy of Vietnam, improve the people's living standards, and provide favorable conditions for the development of Vietnam's industry.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has also made remarkable achievements in developing industry. Before the victory of the revolution, although Vietnam possessed a large amount of minerals and agricultural raw materials, the industrial base was very weak due to the plunder of French colonialism. Only the mining industry and individual processing industries had seen some development. During the War of Resistance, the People's Government developed its own industry in the midst of dense mountains and forests, in very difficult environments, establishing several departments such as defense industry, textile industry, paper industry, chemical industry, and pharmaceutical industry, ensuring the needs of the War of Resistance and appropriately meeting the needs of the people's lives. The People's Government actively developed the production of soap, matches, sugar, salt, and other industries closely related to daily life, and vigorously supported and developed handicrafts, basically solving the problem of consumer goods. Long ago, the government planned and began to restore and expand the cement industry, glass factory, and textile factory that were severely damaged during the war, and planned to build new hydropower stations to greatly increase the total capacity of Vietnam's power stations. Since this year, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has begun to expand and build a number of state-owned factories, including phosphate fertilizer plants, paper mills, machine repair plants, and match factories. The giant Hong Gai coal enterprise was nationalized after liberation and immediately began to resume production, with output rapidly increasing.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam also takes care of private industries, helping and guiding them to develop small-scale industries through methods such as credit, ordering, supply of raw materials, and sales of finished products.

Clearly aware that they are producing and fighting for themselves and for the cause of the liberation of the motherland, the working class of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has displayed a high degree of initiative and creativity. From the War of Resistance until February this year, workers have successively put forward 45,000 inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals, and 12,466 model workers have emerged. They have continuously created excellent records on the production front, greatly increasing labor productivity and promoting the development of industrial production.

In order to meet the needs of the long-term War of Resistance and the rapid recovery and development of the entire national economy, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attaches great importance to the restoration and development of the transportation industry. By the end of 1954, most of the roads in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had been restored to traffic. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repaired more than 1,200 kilometers of roads since the restoration of peace; together with the more than 3,000 kilometers that had been restored in the liberated areas during the second half of the war, there are now more than 4,400 kilometers of roads open to traffic. In terms of railways, the Hanoi-Friendship Pass railway linking Vietnam and China officially opened to traffic on February 28 this year. This year, the Hanoi-Lao Cai and Hanoi-Nam Dinh railways will be repaired. In addition, 167 bridges will be repaired this year (which is more than five times the number of bridges repaired in 1954) and 55 railway stations. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is also systematically restoring maritime and inland waterway transport. At present, more than 1,500 kilometers of inland waterways north of the 17th parallel have been fully restored.

In terms of national financial work, the phenomena of overspending, currency devaluation, and unstable prices that existed in the early days of the War of Resistance have been eliminated. Due to increased industrial and agricultural production, the development of state-owned enterprises, and a series of measures such as streamlining state institutions—resulting in savings in administrative expenses of state organs—and improving the tax system, the state's revenue and expenditure have been balanced and prices have stabilized by the beginning of 1953. This has provided very favorable conditions for the recovery and development of Vietnam's national economy.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is also committed to developing domestic and foreign trade. In terms of domestic trade, the market is becoming increasingly active, and the circulation of the three major commodities—rice, cloth, and salt—has greatly increased. State-owned and private commerce have developed accordingly; the work of adjusting industry and commerce has also achieved initial results. The exchange of goods between cities and rural areas is increasing day by day. In the first three months of this year, the exchange of goods between Hanoi and various provinces increased threefold compared to the last three months of 1954. At the same time, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is also concerned with restoring normal trade relations between the two regions of North and South Vietnam and has made many efforts.

In terms of foreign trade, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam first established trade relations with fraternal countries. Over the past few years, the exchange of goods with fraternal countries has greatly increased. This year, the amount of goods exchanged under the trade agreement signed between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China has increased threefold compared to 1954. The increase in exports to China has resulted in a large number of machines, chemical raw materials, and daily necessities. This trade not only helps to develop the peaceful economy but also helps to improve the lives of the people.

The Vietnam Workers' Party, the government, and President Hồ Chí Minh have always cared for the working people and have adopted practical and feasible measures to improve their living standards and improve working conditions in industry and agriculture in accordance with economic development. Workers and staff work eight hours a day and have fifteen days of paid leave each year, and they also enjoy free medical care. The People's Government stipulates that female workers and child laborers receive "equal pay for equal work." The government also established sanatoriums for workers to recuperate. The issue of workers learning politics and culture has also been given attention. In addition, the government has also begun to solve the unemployment problem left over from the old society. In Hanoi and other newly liberated cities alone, 45,000 unemployed people have found jobs by May of this year.

The people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's cause of restoring and building the national economy has received enthusiastic support from the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries. President Hồ Chí Minh pointed out in a speech in Beijing, China, on June 26: "In our cause of national construction, we have received strong support from the Soviet Union, China, and many other friendly countries. The support of this precious friendship has become an important force inspiring us to move forward continuously."

    越南民主共和国在经济战线上的巨大成就
    周修庆
    越南民主共和国成立以来，共和国的人民在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的英明领导下，不仅在军事上赢得了辉煌的胜利，而且在其他方面也取得了伟大的成就。印度支那和平恢复后，越南民主共和国的人民发挥高度的爱国主义劳动热忱，积极医治战争创伤，使越南民主共和国的国民经济迅速地恢复和发展起来。
    越南是一个土地肥沃、物产富饶的国家。但是，过去在法国殖民者和国内地主阶级的统治下，人民的生活极其穷困。八月革命以前，人口不到百分之五的地主阶级和法国殖民者占有百分之七十五以上的土地；而占越南总人口约百分之九十的广大农民只占有约百分之二十五的大部分是贫瘠的土地。越南全国四百多万农户中，无地或少地的即占过半数——二百一十二万三千二百多户。地主和法国殖民者每年从农民手中榨取去百分之七十到八十的收获物。
    越南民主共和国成立后，实行了一系列的改善农民情况和发展农业生产的措施。一九四五年以来，人民政府陆续颁布减租、减息法令，一九五三年五月，胡志明主席又发布命令，没收原属于法国殖民者和越奸的土地以及征收无主的土地，并把这些土地暂时分配给无地或少地的农民，这些措施都受到了广大农民的热烈欢迎。
    一九五三年十二月，根据越南劳动党的土地改革纲领，越南民主共和国国民大会通过、并由政府颁布了历史性的土地改革法。一九五四年初，在越南劳动党和政府的领导下，广大农村地区有计划、有步骤地开始实行土地改革，取得了重大的胜利。据统计，经过七期减租和三期土地改革，在越南北部已有五百六十七万人口的地区减过租，一百九十八万人口的地区完成土地改革。
    经过土地改革后的农村，地主阶级的政治威势已被彻底打垮，农民做了自己土地的主人，他们的生活得到了保障且在日益提高。农村中普遍地出现了欣欣向荣的景象。
    和平恢复后，越南的农业生产进一步地提高了。土地的耕种面积逐年扩大，农作物产量日益增加。今年，越南红河左岸区单是太平省一省，夏稻的耕作面积就从二万公顷扩大到八万三千多公顷。在河内市郊，那些在法国殖民者统治时期每越亩（一越亩合中国五亩半）产量不到二百公斤的稻田，今年的产量达到了七、八百公斤。越南民主共和国一九五四年六月三十日颁布的关于鼓励农业生产的十项政策，是促进农业生产提高的一个重要因素。
    越南民主共和国一九五五—五六年在农业生产方面的主要任务是把粮食生产量恢复到战前水平。这个任务的胜利完成，将大大地促进越南整个国民经济的发展，提高人民的生活水平，而对越南工业的发展，也将提供有利的条件。
    越南民主共和国在发展工业方面，也取得了显著的成就。革命胜利以前，越南虽然拥有大量矿物和农业原料，但由于法国殖民主义掠夺的结果，工业的基础是非常薄弱的，只有采矿工业和个别的加工工业部门得到了某些发展。抗战时期，人民政府在丛山密林、非常困难的环境下发展了自己的工业，建立了国防工业、纺织工业、造纸工业和化学工业、制药工业等若干部门，保证了抗战的需要，并适当满足了广大人民生活的要求。人民政府积极发展肥皂、火柴、制糖、制盐等同日常生活有密切关系的工业生产，并大力扶助和发展手工业生产，基本上解决了消费品问题。好久以前，政府就计划并已着手恢复和扩大在战时遭到严重破坏的水泥工业、玻璃厂和纺织厂，并计划建设新的水力发电站，大大增加越南发电站的总能力。今年以来，越南民主共和国开始扩建和新建一批国营工厂，其中包括磷酸盐制造厂、造纸厂、机器修理厂和火柴厂等。巨大的鸿基煤炭企业在解放后收归国营，立即开始恢复生产，产量迅速提高。
    越南民主共和国对私营工业也加以照顾，以信贷、订货、供给原料、推销成品等方式，帮助和指导它们发展小型工业。
    清楚地意识到他们是在为自己、为祖国的解放事业而生产和斗争着的越南民主共和国工人阶级，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。从抗战起到今年二月止，工人们先后提出了四万五千件创造、发明和合理化建议，涌现了一万二千四百六十六位劳动模范。他们在生产战线上不断地创造了优异的纪录，大大地提高了劳动生产率，促进了工业生产的发展。
    为了适应长期抗战和整个国民经济迅速恢复和发展的需要，越南民主共和国政府很重视交通运输业的恢复和发展。到一九五四年年底，越南民主共和国地区的公路已大部恢复通车。越南民主共和国政府自和平恢复以来已修复公路一千二百多公里；加上战争后半期就已在解放区内恢复了的三千多公里，现在能通车的公路已有四千四百多公里。铁路方面，联接越中两国的河内——睦南关铁路已于今年二月二十八日正式通车。今年将再修复河内——老街、河内——南定两条铁路。此外，今年还将修复一百六十七座桥梁（这等于一九五四年修复桥梁数目的五倍多）和五十五座火车站。越南民主共和国并正在有计划地恢复海运和内河航运事业。目前，十七纬度线以北的一千五百多公里的内河航线已经全部恢复。
    在国家财政工作方面，抗战初期入不敷出、货币贬价、物价不稳的现象已经消除。由于工农业生产增加，国营企业发展，同时采取了精简国家机构——结果是节省了国家机关行政经费的开支——和改进税制等一连串措施，到一九五三年初，国家的收支已能平衡，物价也稳定了。这对越南国民经济的恢复和发展提供了非常有利的条件。
    越南民主共和国政府并致力于发展国内、国外贸易。国内贸易方面，市场日趋活跃，米、布、盐三种主要商品的流通量大大增加。国营和私营商业相应地有了发展；调整工商业的工作也取得初步成果。城市和乡村之间的物资交流日益增加。在今年头三个月，河内和各省交流的货物比之一九五四年最后的三个月增加了三倍。同时，越南民主共和国政府也关心恢复北越和南越两个地区之间的正常通商关系，并作了很多的努力。
    在对外贸易方面，越南民主共和国首先和兄弟国家建立了贸易关系。几年来，和各兄弟国家交流的货物有了很大的增加。今年越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国签订的贸易合同的货物交换数额比之一九五四年增加了三倍。对中国输出的增加，换得了大批机器、化学原料和日用品等。这种贸易不但有助于发展和平经济，而且也有利于改善人民的生活。
    越南劳动党、政府和胡志明主席一向关怀劳动人民，并适应经济的发展采取切实可行的办法来提高他们的生活水平，改善工农业中的劳动条件。工人和职员们每天工作八小时，每年并有工资照发的十五天休假，还享有公费医疗。人民政府规定女工和童工获得“同工同酬”。政府并创办疗养院给工人休养。工人学习政治和文化的问题也得到重视。此外，政府还着手解决旧社会遗留下来的失业问题。单在河内等几个新解放的城市，在今年五月份前，已有四万五千名失业者获得了职业。
    越南民主共和国人民恢复和建设国民经济的事业得到了苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家的热情支援。胡志明主席六月二十六日在中国北京的一次讲话中指出：“在我们进行国家建设的事业中，我们得到苏联、中国和其他许多友好国家大力的支持。这种宝贵友谊的支持，成为鼓舞我们不断前进的重要力量。”
