Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, June 27th (TASS dispatch): At the plenary sessions of the World Peace Conference on the afternoon and evening of June 26th, delegates from various countries continued to speak.

    Baltazar Castro, former Speaker of the Chilean Chamber of Deputies, pointed out that Chile and other Latin American countries must be freed from the rule of American monopoly capital. He suggested convening a representative meeting of Latin American countries to defend peace.

    French writer Jean-Paul Sartre said that we demand coexistence, but not coexistence between two blocs, because such coexistence in fact harbors the crisis of a new war. What we hope for is the peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems. The peace we demand cannot be the maintenance of the status quo; the peace we demand should lead to a real change in relations between countries. We are not so much hoping for neutrality as we are hoping for the independence of our country. For our country, the issue is not to remain neutral in a war, but to not allow war and to restore its sovereignty.

    Nuske, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, said that Germany should be unified on the basis of peace, and European security should be guaranteed through peaceful negotiations. He said that the arming of West Germany must be stopped, as it would lead to a third world war.

    I. Yu. Fafa, a member of the International Jewish Committee for Struggle Against the Arming of Germany, suggested that the conference call on the four major powers to seek a solution to the German question that could completely prevent Germany from rearming.

    Archbishop Nikolai of Krutitsy and Kolomna (USSR) emphasized the need to unite all forces to fight for peace. He advocated that large-scale destructive weapons should be banned first. He said that the most important thing is that peace advocates from all parties represented at this conference can unanimously understand the essence of what is happening in the world today and agree to take joint action to strive for a peaceful resolution of all international issues.

    The conference read a congratulatory letter from Yuri Belikov, Secretary-General of the International Union of Students, in which he assured the conference that the world's students would contribute their knowledge and youthful strength to the cause of consolidating world peace.

    Glover (Australia), a representative of the Anglican Church, said that some great powers regard Australia as a military base for attacking Asian countries, and this intention is supported by the Australian government. The movement of the Australian people to resist this policy is growing.

    Williams, a representative of the Union of South Africa, playwright and director, said that we have brought a letter signed by ten million African residents, requesting the conference to support the struggle of the African people for national liberation and the elimination of racial discrimination.

    Mu. Hadi, a member of the Iraqi delegation, spoke about the growing peace movement in Arab countries and the struggle of the people of these countries against the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the plenary session of the World Peace Conference on June 27th was chaired by Alain Le Leap, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor.

    Belgian Professor Edgar Andre spoke, saying that Belgium has twice been a bloody battlefield. The Belgian people yearn for peace. The National Congress representing 189,000 veterans expressed opposition to the arming of West Germany and support for the banning of atomic weapons.

    Then, Mao Dun, the head of the Chinese delegation, spoke at the conference. In his speech, he explained the efforts made by the Chinese people for the cause of defending peace and their desire to develop international friendly cooperation.

    Mao Dun emphasized that the Chinese people's basic concept of peace and the Chinese people's desire for peace have been reflected in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The preface to the Constitution solemnly states that China "establishes and develops diplomatic relations with any country on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity." He said that this principle summarizes the past relations between the Chinese people and the people of other countries over the past five years, and also guides the future relations between the Chinese people and the people of other countries. This principle has developed into the Five Principles of the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' Joint Statement. He said that the Chinese people are willing to abide by it and believe that it can serve as the basis for peaceful coexistence among the people of all countries. These five principles were further developed into ten principles at the Asian-African Conference. The Chinese people are also willing to abide by it and believe that it can also serve as the basis for peaceful coexistence among the people of all countries.

    Mao Dun finally quoted the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of the Soviet Union and India on June 22, saying that wider recognition of the Five Principles can promote the generation of mutual trust and clear the way for close international cooperation. He emphasized: "I believe this road can be cleared." The participants responded to Mao Dun's speech with warm applause.

    Singh Sock, a member of the Indian Parliament, spoke about the issue of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. He talked about the atomic bombings in Japan during World War II and the dangerous consequences of the American testing of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in recent years. He advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    August Troop, a member of the German Social Democratic Party, said that the German Social Democratic Party opposes the Paris Agreement. He criticized the militarization policy pursued by the West German government, and he advocated the conclusion of an all-European collective security treaty. He said that the German people have great hopes for the upcoming talks between the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet government.

    Professor Bernard Lavigne, a well-known French figure, emphasized that anyone with a minimum of intelligence and a clear mind should participate in the movement to defend peace. Therefore, it is completely wrong to say that the current movement to defend peace is a communist movement.

    He said that today in France, no one believes the claim that the Soviet Union has warlike intentions. He advocated that major powers sign an agreement on disarmament, a universal security treaty, and an agreement that some countries in Western and Central Europe do not participate in military blocs. He advocated peaceful coexistence among all peoples, respect for national independence, and the restoration of national unity in Korea, Vietnam, and Germany.

    Jordanian representative I. Habashineh spoke out against the imperialists' enslavement of the people of backward countries and their hindrance to their political, economic, and cultural development. At the same time, he pointed out that no means of suppression can stop the movement of the people of these backward countries to free themselves from colonial oppression.

    Swedish writer E. Blomberg mentioned the various benefits that Sweden's neutral policy has given Sweden. He said that Sweden's peace defenders are well aware that in order to maintain these benefits, the struggle for peace must be launched.

    Italian Professor Antonio Chesli, who attended the conference as an observer, said that he does not belong to any party and that he had participated in the anti-fascist movement in the past. He said that all patriotic people, regardless of their political views, must unite and participate in the struggle for peace.

    Mr. Louby, a member of the French Socialist Party and Chairman of the Correze Provincial Council, said that although the leadership of the French Socialist Party prevents members from participating in the peace movement, the majority of ordinary Socialist Party members believe that peace is what they desire.

    Hungarian representative D. Lukach condemned the United States' policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

    茅盾着重指出，中国人民对于和平的基本概念和中国人民的和平愿望已经在中华人民共和国宪法中体现出来，宪法序言里庄严地写着，中国“根据平等、互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系”。他说，这一原则总结了五年来中国人民同其他各国人民的过去关系，也指导着中国人民同其他各国人民的今后关系。这一原则发展成了中印总理联合声明的五项原则。他说，中国人民愿意遵守它，并且认为它可以作为各国人民和平共处的基础。这个五项原则在亚非会议上又发展成为十项原则。中国人民也愿意遵守它，同样认为它可以作为各国人民和平共处的基础。
