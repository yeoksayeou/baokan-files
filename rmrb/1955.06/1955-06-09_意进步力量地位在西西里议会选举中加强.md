    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 8th: According to TASS, the elections for the Sicilian Regional Assembly in Italy were held on June 5th, and the results were officially announced on the 7th.

    In this election, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party presented the voters with a program of democratic reform, land reform, industrialization, and strengthening the autonomous government of the Sicilian region, and called on voters to strive for peace and oppose turning Sicily into an American military base. As a result of the election, the position of these two parties was strengthened: the Communist Party received 481,975 votes (accounting for 20.8 percent of the total votes) and won 20 seats in the 90-seat Sicilian Regional Assembly; the Socialist Party received 225,944 votes (accounting for 9.7 percent of the total votes) and won 10 seats. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party, compared to the "People's Front" they formed with other left-wing organizations in the 1951 Sicilian Regional Assembly election, gained more than 62,700 votes and four seats.

    The ruling Christian Democratic Party used intimidation, oppression, and bribery to obtain 895,318 votes (accounting for 38.6 percent of the total votes) and 37 seats, seven more than in the previous election. However, the Christian Democratic Party's "achievement" was only obtained at the expense of extreme right-wing parties and its "partners." The ruling party did not achieve its goal of gaining an absolute majority in the Regional Assembly—the Liberal Party, which participated in the government, only won three seats, and the "Social Democratic Republican Alliance," formed by another party participating in the government, the Social Democratic Party, and the Republican Party, which supported the government's policies, also only won two seats.

    The extreme right-wing "National Monarchist Party" won eight seats in the election; the "People's Monarchist Party," which split from this party, won one seat. The neo-fascist party "Italian Social Movement" won nine seats. The Monarchist Party's seats were reduced compared to 1951, and the neo-fascist party also lost some votes and seats.

    Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti told a "Unità" reporter regarding the results of the Sicilian Regional Assembly election that the Communists repelled all the offensives of the reactionary forces, defended, and even strengthened the Communist Party's position as the leading force of the people. An editorial in "Avanti!" also pointed out, when discussing the achievements of the Socialist Party, that the left-wing parties have achieved new achievements both in absolute numbers and in percentage terms.

    意进步力量地位在西西里议会选举中加强
    新华社八日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利西西里区议会的选举在六月五日举行，选举结果已经在七日正式公布。
    在这次选举中，共产党和社会党向选民提出了实行民主改革、土地改革、工业化和加强西西里区自治政权的纲领，并且号召选民争取和平、反对把西西里变成美国军事基地。选举结果，这两个党的地位是加强了：共产党得四十八万一千九百七十五票（占总票数百分之二十点八），在西西里区议会的九十个议席中取得二十席，社会党得二十二万五千九百四十四票（占总票数百分之九点七），取得十席；共产党和社会党比一九五一年西西里区议会选举时它们同其他一些左翼组织结成的“人民阵线”多得六万二千七百多张选票和四个议席。
    执政党天主教民主党使用恫吓、压迫和收买等手段，使自己得到八十九万五千三百一十八票
  （占总票数百分之三十八点六）和三十七个议席，比上届选举多得七席。但是，天主教民主党的“成就”仅仅是靠牺牲极端右翼的党派以及它的“小伙伴”才获得的。执政党并没有达到在区议会中获得绝对多数的目的——参加政府的自由党只获得三个议席，另一个参加政府的政党社会民主党同支持政府政策的共和党结成的“社会民主共和联盟”也只获得两个议席。
    极端右翼的“民族保皇党”在选举中获得了八个议席；从这个党分裂出来的“人民保皇党”获得了一席。新法西斯党“意大利社会运动”获得了九席。保皇党的议席比一九五一年减少了，而新法西斯党也失去了一些选票和议席。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂对“团结报”记者谈西西里区议会选举结果说：共产党人击退了反动势力的一切进攻，守住了，甚至于加强了领导人民力量的共产党的阵地。“前进报”的社论谈到社会党的成就时也指出：左翼党派无论在绝对数字上和在百分比上都获得了新的成就。
