Make Full Use of Existing Equipment to Save Construction Funds
By our reporter Wu Yubing

At the beginning of this year, the East China Textile Administration Bureau carefully reviewed and revised the capital construction investment plans for 1955 of its affiliated factories, reduced projects that were optional or could be postponed. The investment of state-owned factories was reduced by more than two-thirds of the original plan. Including some joint state-private factories, the total investment reduced amounted to more than 8 million yuan. This measure saves a large amount of construction funds and can also promote the East China textile industry to fully utilize the potential power of existing equipment.

In the past few years, the leaders of many textile factories in Shanghai lacked an overall perspective and, starting only from their own factories, blindly pursued "balance" and blindly developed under the guidance of the idea of "bigger, better, newer, and more complete." For example, the State-owned Shanghai No. 3 Wool Textile Factory successively built all the weaving workshops and combing workshops in 1951 and 1953. After the factory buildings were built, it was discovered that the power equipment was insufficient, so the transformer workshop was added, and boilers were added. After adding factory buildings and power equipment, it was found that the machinery and equipment were insufficient, and this year it is planned to add steam fulling machines and wool top rewashing machines and other equipment. The State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Wool Textile Factory originally only had coarse spinning equipment, and also requested to add fine spinning equipment when formulating this year's plan. In order to keep up with the No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory, the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory added transformers and other equipment in 1953, and added boilers in 1954. When compiling the 1955 plan, it requested to add an eight-color printing machine and planned to continue to expand. In this way, many factories grew bigger and bigger like a snowball. The State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Textile Machinery Factory, for example, was originally a repair section of the No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory before liberation. As a result of blind development after liberation, it has expanded into an independent factory with a complete set of buildings such as office buildings and warehouses. Some joint state-private factories also built factory buildings, office buildings, and auditoriums, and added equipment regardless of whether they were needed or not.

Shanghai's textile industry developed in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, far away from raw material producing areas and vast consumer areas. Shanghai's spindles account for about one-third of the total number of spindles in the country, and printing and dyeing equipment accounts for about 50% of the total number in the country. In the past few years since liberation, the output of Shanghai's yarn, cloth, printing and dyeing, knitwear, and sacks have exceeded the highest annual output in history, but due to insufficient raw material supply, the potential of the equipment is still great. The tasks of cotton spinning and printing and dyeing factories are insufficient, and the utilization rate of wool textile factories' equipment is also relatively low. Although the tasks have increased this year, it is still far from the full utilization of the equipment potential. The existing equipment of silk reeling, silk, silk, and knitting factories can mostly only be utilized to 50% to 70%. The above facts fully illustrate that the development of Shanghai's textile industry is not a matter of building factory buildings and adding equipment, but how to rationally utilize existing equipment under an overall arrangement.

At the same time, if the equipment is too concentrated, the raw materials need to be transported from distant places, and the products have to be transported to other places for sale. From the national point of view, this is very unreasonable. According to statistics, the transportation cost of transporting one dan of cotton from Xi'an and Handan to Shanghai, spinning it into yarn, and then transporting it back to the above two places is more than 13 to 14 yuan. The following phenomenon often occurs: cotton is transported from Shanxi, Hebei, and other places to Wuxi and Changzhou in Jiangsu Province to be spun into yarn and cloth, then transported to Shanghai for printing and dyeing, and then sent to consumers all over the country. This back-and-forth journey not only consumes the country's transportation capacity but also increases the burden on consumers. The Shanghai purchasing and supply station of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company alone paid transportation costs in 1954, which, calculated at the wholesale price, could purchase more than 1.26975 million pieces of Longtou fine cloth. In order to gradually change this unreasonable situation, Shanghai's textile factories should not blindly increase equipment and expand factory buildings.

From the utilization of the equipment that some factories in Shanghai have added, it also illustrates the waste of these factories. For example, the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory added automatic coal loading equipment. In fact, the amount of coal used in a day can be transported in only one or two hours with this machine, and most of the time it is left idle. The new precision lathe added by the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Textile Machinery Factory in 1954 is often not needed in actual work and has to be used as an ordinary lathe. A new radial drilling machine purchased by this factory can only be used a few times a year. There are many other similar situations.

This year, the East China Textile Administration Bureau fully noticed these problems and greatly reduced the basic construction investment that was not urgently needed when reviewing the basic construction investment plans for 1955 of its affiliated factories in accordance with the central government's instructions on focusing on key construction and practicing strict economy. After the investment was reduced, the staff and workers of many factories have paid attention to fully utilizing the potential power of existing equipment. For example, the Jiaxing Silk Spinning Factory had planned to invest more than 100,000 yuan this year to build a water filter pool. After the review and reduction, the problem can be solved by using the factory's original deep well water at a cost of only more than 4,000 yuan. The State-owned No. 5 Printing and Dyeing Factory originally planned to add a flat washing machine. After research, by improving the operating methods and adjusting the product varieties uniformly by the Administration Bureau, it is also possible to produce without adding this equipment. The staff and workers of some joint state-private factories have also paid attention to giving play to the potential power of existing equipment. For example, the joint state-private Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory originally planned to invest in the construction of a warehouse, and the joint state-private Guangzhong Printing and Dyeing Factory originally planned to add three dyeing vats. Now they have automatically cut them off. These two items alone can save more than 270,000 yuan in investment. Due to attention to the use of existing equipment, although more than 30 kinds of machines have been reduced, it does not affect production.

    充分利用原有设备节省建设资金
    本报记者　吴于冰
    今年年初，华东纺织管理局认真审查并修改了所属各厂一九五五年的基本建设投资计划，削减了可办可不办和可以缓办的项目，国营各厂的投资按原计划削减了三分之二以上，连部分公私合营工厂在内，削减的投资总数有八百多万元。这一措施，节省了大量建设资金，同时也可以促进华东纺织工业充分发挥现有设备的潜在力量。
    过去几年中，上海不少纺织工厂的领导人员缺乏全面观点，只从本厂出发，在“要大、要好、要新、要全”的思想指导下盲目追求“平衡”，盲目发展。如国营上海第三毛纺织厂，一九五一年和一九五三年先后修建了全部织布厂房和梳毛厂房。等到厂房修建起来以后，又发现动力设备不足，于是又增建变压器车间，增添锅炉。等到增加了厂房和动力设备以后，又发现机器设备不足，今年又计划增添蒸汽制呢机和毛条复洗机等设备。国营上海第一毛纺织厂，原来只有粗纺设备，在制定今年计划时也要求增加细纺设备。国营上海第二印染厂为了向第一印染厂看齐，一九五三年增加了变压器等设备，一九五四年又增加了锅炉。在编订一九五五年计划时，又要求增加八色印花机，并打算继续进行扩建。这样，许多厂像滚雪球一样越滚越大。像国营上海第一纺织机械制造厂，解放前原是第五棉纺织厂的一个修理部分，解放后由于盲目发展的结果，已扩展成了一个独立的工厂，并拥有办公楼房、仓库等全套建筑。一些公私合营工厂，也不管需要不需要，就盖厂房，盖办公大楼，盖大礼堂，添设备。
    上海的纺织工业是在半封建半殖民地社会里发展起来的，远离原料产地和广大消费地区。上海的纱锭约占全国纱锭总数三分之一，印染设备占全国总数百分之五十左右。解放后的几年来，上海纱布、印染、针织、麻袋等的产品都超过了历史上最高的年产量，但由于原料供应不足，设备的潜力仍然很大，棉纺和印染等厂的任务不足，毛纺织厂设备的利用率也比较低，今年任务虽有增加，但离设备潜力的充分利用，仍相差很远。而缫丝、绢、绸、针织等厂的现有设备，大多都只能利用到百分之五十到七十。上述事实，充分说明了上海纺织工业的发展，不是盖厂房、添设备的问题，而是如何在全面安排下合理利用旧有设备的问题。
    同时，设备过于集中，原料就需要从很远的外地运来，产品又要运到外地销售，从全国的观点来看，这是很不合理的。据统计，一担棉花从西安、邯郸运到上海，纺成纱以后再运到上述两地，运杂费用就需十三元至十四元多。常常有这样的现象：把棉花远从山西、河北等地运到江苏无锡、常州等地纺织成纱、布以后，运到上海印染，然后再送到全国各地消费者手里，这样往返周折，不仅耗费了国家运输力量，也加重了消费者的负担。仅中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站一个部门，在一九五四年内由于运进运出所支付的运杂费用，按批发现价计算，就可购买龙头细布一百二十六万九千七百五十多匹。为了逐步改变这种不合理状态，上海的纺织工厂是不应盲目增加设备，扩大厂房。
    从上海有些厂已添置的设备利用情形来看，也说明了这些厂的浪费情况。如国营上海第一棉纺织厂添置了自动加煤设备，实际上一天用的煤，用这种机器只需要一两个小时就可以运完，大部分时间则放在那里闲置不用。国营上海第一纺织机械制造厂一九五四年添置的精密度很高的新式车床，实际工作中常常用不着，只好拿去当普通车床使用，这个厂购置的一台新式横臂钻床，一年里只能用上几次。其他类似情况还很多。
    今年华东纺织管理局充分注意到这些问题，在审定所属各厂一九五五年度基本建设投资计划时，按照中央重点建设、厉行节约的指示，把不急需的基本建设投资大大加以削减。不少厂的职工在投资削减后，已注意充分利用现有设备的潜在力量。像嘉兴绢纺厂，曾计划在今年投资十多万元修建一座滤水池，经审查削减后，利用该厂原有深井水只花四千多元即可解决问题。国营第五印染厂原计划添一台平洗机，经研究后通过改进操作方法，并由管理局统一调整生产品种，不添置这项设备也同样可以生产。有些公私合营厂的职工也注意了发挥现有设备的潜在力量，像公私合营新丰印染厂，原计划投资修建仓库，公私合营光中印染厂原计划增加三个染缸，现在都自动削去了，仅此两项即可节省投资二十七万多元。由于注意利用现有设备，虽然削减了三十多种机器，但并不影响生产。
