The public security organs in the Xuzhou area of Jiangsu Province have smashed a counter-revolutionary group, the "Chinese Kuomintang Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui Tri-Province Joint Secret Office," that was lurking in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces to carry out sabotage activities. This counter-revolutionary group was headed by counter-revolutionaries Zhu Hanchen and Wang Hongyun, and was composed of reactionary landlords, unlawful rich peasants, and ruffian elements. Counter-revolutionary criminal Zhu Hanchen was originally an officer under the bandit Chiang Kai-shek's Li Mi, and escaped during the Huaihai Campaign, surviving by relying on the support of reactionary landlords and unlawful rich peasants, waiting for an opportunity to act. In 1952, Zhu colluded with bandit leader Wang Hongyun, Kuomintang secret agent Song Chuanzhen, reactionary landlord Cai Dunkuan, and others to formally establish a counter-revolutionary group and actively develop its followers. These counter-revolutionary elements disguised themselves as peddlers, cart drivers, knife sharpeners, etc., as cover, operating in sixteen counties and cities, including Fengxian, Peixian, Xuzhou, Taierzhuang, and Yixian, and established a headquarters and secret strongholds in Fengxian. They also forged various documents, posing as revolutionary soldiers and government officials,妄想trying to obtain legal status to carry out counter-revolutionary criminal activities, and spreading rumors among the masses to carry out counter-revolutionary propaganda. In order to obtain funds for their activities, these counter-revolutionary elements robbed and killed people everywhere. In July 1954, these counter-revolutionary elements held several secret meetings, conspiring to seize weapons, rob state banks and cooperatives, and妄想attempting to establish so-called "guerrilla bases" in the Weishan Lake area.

	With the active help of the militia and the masses, the public security organs, after careful investigation, rounded up this counter-revolutionary group at the end of 1954, and legally arrested thirty-two counter-revolutionary elements headed by Zhu Hanchen and Wang Hongyun. They also seized one box gun, one pistol, one grenade, fifty-six rounds of ammunition, more than thirty forged documents and reactionary leaflets, and more than forty other counter-revolutionary documents and implements.

	The Xuzhou District Intermediate People's Court of Jiangsu Province legally sentenced the principal offenders Zhu Hanchen, Wang Hongyun, Hong Fujing, Song Chuanzhen, Cai Dunkuan, and Cheng Benliang to death with immediate execution, and sentenced the remaining criminals to life imprisonment, imprisonment, or control, respectively.

    徐州地区公安机关破获一个反革命集团
    江苏省徐州地区公安机关破获了一个潜伏在江苏、山东、安徽三省边境地区进行破坏活动的反革命集团“中国国民党苏、鲁、皖三省联密处”。这个反革命集团是以反革命分子朱汉臣、王洪运为首，搜罗一些反动地主、不法富农、兵痞流氓分子组成的。反革命罪犯朱汉臣原是蒋贼李瀰部下的军官，在淮海战役中逃脱后，由反动地主、不法富农供养潜伏下来，待机活动。一九五二年，朱匪勾结匪首王洪运、军统特务宋传珍、反动地主蔡敦宽等正式成立反革命集团，积极发展党羽。这批反革命分子伪装成小贩、赶马车的、磨剪刀的，等等，作为掩护，活动于丰县、沛县、徐州、台儿庄、峄县等十六个县市，并在丰县设立了指挥部和秘密据点。他们还伪造各种证件，冒充革命军人、政府机关工作人员，妄想取得合法身份进行反革命罪恶活动，并在广大群众中散布谣言，进行反革命宣传。这些反革命分子为了取得活动经费，到处拦路抢劫、杀害群众。一九五四年七月间，这些反革命分子几次秘密集会，阴谋夺取武器、抢劫国家银行、合作社，妄图在微山湖一带建立所谓“游击根据地”。
    公安机关在民兵和群众的积极帮助下，经严密的侦查，在一九五四年年底将这个反革命集团一网打尽，依法逮捕了以朱汉臣、王洪运为首的反革命分子三十二名。并缴获盒枪一枝、手枪一枝、手榴弹一枚、子弹五十六发，伪造证件、反动传单三十多份，其他各种反革命证件和用具四十余件。
    江苏省徐州地区中级人民法院依法将主犯朱汉臣、王洪运、洪辅敬、宋传珍、蔡敦宽、程本亮判处死刑立即执行，对其余罪犯分别判处无期徒刑、徒刑或管制。
