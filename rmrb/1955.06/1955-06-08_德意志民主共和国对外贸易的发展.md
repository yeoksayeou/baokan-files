    The Development of Foreign Trade in the German Democratic Republic
    Ku Gregory, State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign and Domestic Trade of the German Democratic Republic

    With the final victory of the Soviet army over the German fascist aggressors on May 8, 1945, the German people in eastern Germany began to embark on a path of peaceful and democratic development.

    According to the Potsdam Agreement, with the help of the Soviet army, the power of monopoly capitalists and Junker landlords was eliminated. German workers and working farmers built the first worker-peasant state from the fascist ruins.

    Without the generous assistance of the Soviet Union, the revolutionary reforms carried out by the German Democratic Republic and the achievements of the working class, working farmers, and intellectuals in building the foundations of socialism would have been impossible. Soviet experts helped us to quickly overcome the wounds of war and transformed industry by adopting the latest experience of Soviet science and technology, mechanized agriculture, and enabled the entire national economy to achieve rapid development.

    In particular, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Poland's abandonment of reparations and the transfer of all Soviet joint-stock companies to the German people enabled the economy of the German Democratic Republic to rise sharply.

    If the industrial production of the German Democratic Republic in 1950 is taken as one hundred, then 1951 is equal to more than one hundred and twenty-two, 1952 – more than one hundred and forty-one, 1953 – one hundred and fifty-nine, 1954 – more than one hundred and seventy-six, and 1955 will increase by nearly double compared to 1950.

    Based on the constantly developing economy, the foreign trade of the German Democratic Republic has greatly developed since 1945. The foreign trade volume in 1954 was equal to two and a half times that of 1950.

    The foreign trade policy of the German Democratic Republic, like other countries in the world peace camp, is an inseparable part of its peaceful foreign policy.

    The purpose of the foreign trade policy of the German Democratic Republic is to continuously consolidate peace and friendship between peoples, and to carry out peaceful cooperation with the peoples of all countries by establishing and expanding peaceful trade relations on an equal basis.

    The basis of the German Democratic Republic's foreign trade is trade with countries in the democratic world market. This trade accounts for 75 percent of the total foreign trade volume. If the trade volume with these countries is taken as one hundred in 1950, it increased to one hundred and fifty-nine in 1951, one hundred and seventy-nine in 1952, two hundred and thirty-nine in 1953, and even reached three hundred and thirteen in 1954.

    In the trade between the German Democratic Republic and democratic countries, trade with the great Soviet Union ranks first, accounting for about 45 percent of the total foreign trade volume and nearly 60 percent of the total trade with all democratic countries.

    The trade between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union has greatly developed in recent years. 1954 increased by nearly two and a half times compared to 1950. The exchange of goods with the Soviet Union is completely beneficial to the economic structure of the German Democratic Republic and meets its needs. The Soviet Union is the main customer for the main industrial sectors of the German Democratic Republic, especially machine manufacturing, electrical industry, and optical precision instrument industry products.

    Most of the goods exported to the Soviet Union are manufactured goods. The German Democratic Republic mainly imports raw materials and semi-finished products, as well as food and agricultural products from the Soviet Union. In 1955, 76 percent of the goods imported by the German Democratic Republic from the Soviet Union were raw materials, 22 percent were food, and more than 80 percent of the German Democratic Republic's exports were manufactured goods. The Soviet Union supplies a large amount of coal, ore, rolled products, non-ferrous metals, raw materials for the chemical industry, raw materials for the textile industry, grain, food, and other things.

    The percentage of goods of great significance to the national economy imported by the German Democratic Republic from the Soviet Union as a percentage of the total import volume of these goods is as follows: Rolled products – 65 percent, ore – 95 percent, pig iron – 95 percent, copper and lead – 100 percent, wool – 75 percent, cotton – 95 percent, crude oil – 95 percent, grain – 90 percent.

    The development of trade relations with the Soviet Union enables the planned increase of industrial production in the German Democratic Republic and the continuous improvement of the supply situation for the people.

    In addition to the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China is one of the main trading partners of the German Democratic Republic. Since 1951, trade between the two countries has been developing and consolidating. The Sino-German exchange volume in 1954 increased by 250 percent compared to 1951. In the past two years, the result of scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries has strengthened the exchange of important experience and knowledge in industrial and agricultural production, thereby promoting the acceleration of the socialist construction of the two countries. In the past, the exports of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China were all contracts for the supply of various industrial products, but recently it has gradually changed to the export of complete sets of industrial equipment, entire factories, and specially ordered products. In this regard, as in the past, the products of the German Democratic Republic's optical precision instrument industry, heavy machinery manufacturing industry, machine tool manufacturing industry, and vehicle manufacturing industry have always accounted for the majority of the German Democratic Republic's exports to the People's Republic of China.

    The People's Republic of China, on the basis of friendship and maximum mutual assistance, and in the spirit of internationalism, constantly provides the German Democratic Republic with generous assistance. This assistance effectively supports the struggle for German unification and improves the supply situation for the working people of the German Democratic Republic. The goods supplied by the People's Republic of China to the German Democratic Republic are all products of great significance to the industry and people of the German Democratic Republic.

    The trade between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the democratic world market has become a solid component of the national economic plan of the German Democratic Republic. Its main task is to take care of the needs of the fraternal countries, further enhance the German Democratic Republic's economy for the struggle for German unification, and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction.

    The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries will also be important traditional trading partners of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. Establishing trade relations with the countries of the democratic and socialist camp, which are developing rapidly in a planned manner without crises, will be a reliable basis for this Germany to achieve peaceful and prosperous development.

    Economic figures in West Germany are increasingly aware of this. The demand for developing East-West trade is growing stronger. The intensified control of the West German economy by American imperialism has restricted trade freedom, turned industry to armaments production, and pushed West Germany onto the road of preparing for a new war of aggression.

    The foreign trade of the German Democratic Republic is an important means to enhance the economic strength of the German Democratic Republic and improve the living standards of the people.

    The working class of all Germany proudly watches the ever-growing achievements of the first worker-peasant state in German history - the German Democratic Republic. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, this worker-peasant state has set an example for a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany for the entire German people.

    The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union have consistently supported the German people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland on a democratic basis. The German people are increasingly aware that the Soviet Union is the best friend of the German people. Friendship with the Soviet Union has become the most important thing for all patriotic Germans.

    德意志民主共和国对外贸易的发展
    德意志民主共和国对外与国内贸易部国务秘书  库·格里哥尔
    随着苏联军队在一九四五年五月八日最后战胜了德国法西斯侵略者，德国人民在德国东部开始走上了和平和民主发展的道路。
    根据波茨坦协定，在苏联军队的帮助下消灭了垄断资本家和容克地主的权力。德国工人和劳动农民从法西斯废墟堆中建立起了第一个工农国家。
    没有苏联的慷慨的援助，德意志民主共和国进行的革命性改革和工人阶级、劳动农民以及知识分子建设社会主义基础的成就都是不可能的。苏联专家帮助我们迅速克服了战争的创伤，并且通过采用苏联科学和技术的最新经验改建了工业，进行了农业的机械化，并使整个国民经济获得了迅速的发展。
    特别是苏联和波兰人民共和国的放弃赔款和所有苏联股份公司的企业移交给德国人民，使德意志民主共和国的经济有了直线的上升。
    如果把德意志民主共和国一九五○年的工业生产量当作一百，那末一九五一年就等于一百二十二以上，一九五二年——一百四十一以上，一九五三年——一百五十九，一九五四年——一百七十六以上，一九五五年将比一九五○年增加近一倍。
    在不断发展的经济基础上，德意志民主共和国的对外贸易自一九四五年以来获得了很大的发展。一九五四年的对外贸易额等于一九五○年的两倍半。
    德意志民主共和国的对外贸易政策像世界和平阵营其他国家一样，是和平外交政策的一个不可分的组成部分。
    德意志民主共和国的对外贸易政策的目的是：不断巩固和平和各国人民之间的友谊，通过在平等基础上建立和扩展和平贸易关系来同各国人民进行和平合作。
    德意志民主共和国对外贸易的基础是同民主世界市场各国的贸易。这种贸易占整个对外贸易额的百分之七十五。同这些国家的贸易额如以一九五○年为一百，则一九五一年增为一百五十九，一九五二年增为一百七十九，一九五三年增为二百三十九，一九五四年更达到三百一十三。
    在德意志民主共和国同民主国家进行的贸易中，同伟大的苏联的贸易占首位，约占整个对外贸易额的百分之四十五，并占同所有民主国家的贸易总额的近百分之六十。
    德意志民主共和国和苏联的贸易这些年来有了很大的发展。一九五四年比一九五○年增加了近两倍半。同苏联的货物交换完全有利于德意志民主共和国的经济结构并符合它的需要。苏联是德意志民主共和国的主要工业部门首先是机器制造业、电气工业、光学精密仪器工业等产品的主要顾主。
    输出到苏联去的大部分货品是制成品。德意志民主共和国从苏联进口的主要是原料和半成品以及食品和农产品等。一九五五年德意志民主共和国从苏联进口的货品中有百分之七十六是原料，百分之二十二是食品，而在德意志民主共和国的出口货中有百分之八十以上是制成品。苏联大量地供应煤、矿砂、压延产品、有色金属、化学工业原料、纺织工业原料、粮食、食品和其他等等。
    德意志民主共和国从苏联进口的对国民经济具有重要意义的货物，占这些货物的全部进口额的百分比如下：压延产品——百分之六十五，矿砂——百分之九十五，生铁——百分之九十五，铜铅——百分之一百，羊毛——百分之七十五，棉花——百分之九十五，原油——百分之九十五，粮食——百分之九十。
    发展同苏联的贸易关系使德意志民主共和国的工业生产有计划的增加，并使对人民的供应情况不断地获得改善。
    除了苏联以外，中华人民共和国是德意志民主共和国的主要贸易对象之一。自从一九五一年以来，两国之间的贸易日益发展和巩固。一九五四年的中德换货量比一九五一年增加了百分之二百五十。最近两年来两国进行科学技术合作的结果，加强了工农业生产中的重要经验和知识的交流，从而促使两国的社会主义建设事业加速进行。过去德意志民主共和国对中华人民共和国的输出都是分别签订供给各种工业产品的合同，近来已逐渐改为整套工业设备、整个工厂和专门订制的产品的输出了。在这方面，像以往一样，德意志民主共和国的光学精密仪器工业、重型机器制造业、工作母机制造业和车辆制造业的产品，一直占德意志民主共和国对中华人民共和国输出的大部分。
    中华人民共和国在友好和最大限度互助的基础上，本着国际主义精神不断地给予德意志民主共和国慷慨的援助。这种援助有效地支持了争取德国统一的斗争，改善了对德意志民主共和国劳动人民的供应情况。中华人民共和国供应德意志民主共和国的货物，都是些对德意志民主共和国工业和人民具有重大意义的产品。
    德意志民主共和国同苏联、中华人民共和国和民主世界市场其他国家的贸易已成为德意志民主共和国国民经济计划的一个坚固的组成部分。它的主要任务就是照顾到各兄弟国家的需要，在经济上进一步增强为争取德国统一而奋斗的德意志民主共和国，并保证社会主义建设的顺利进行。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和其他各人民民主国家，也将是一个统一、民主和爱好和平的德国重要的传统贸易对象。同没有危机的、有计划地迅速发展着的民主和社会主义阵营各国建立贸易关系，将是这个德国获得和平繁荣发展的可靠基础。
    西德经济界人士越来越认识到这一点。发展东西贸易的要求越来越强烈了。美国帝国主义对西德经济控制的加紧，限制了贸易自由，把工业转向军备生产，把西德推上准备新侵略战争的道路。
    德意志民主共和国的对外贸易是增强德意志民主共和国经济实力和提高人民生活水平的一个重要手段。
    全德国的工人阶级骄傲地注视着德国历史上第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国所获得的不断增长的成就。这个工农国家在德国统一社会党的领导下为全体德国人民树立了统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的榜样。
    苏联各族人民始终如一地支持着德国人民争取在民主基础上重新统一他们祖国的斗争。德国人民越来越认识到，苏联是德国人民最好的朋友。同苏联友好，已成为所有爱国的德国人最关心的事情了。
