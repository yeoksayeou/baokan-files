    People from all walks of life in Rehe Province have held meetings one after another, demanding the thorough smashing of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. The representatives participating in the First Congress of Directly Subordinate Organs of the Rehe Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League unanimously demanded that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, which is organized, planned, and has a program, and which has had early connections with the Kuomintang bandit gang's secret service, be wiped out in one fell swoop and eradicated completely.

    The Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held its third (enlarged) meeting from the 13th to the 15th to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. Participants eagerly spoke, unanimously demanding severe punishment for the incorrigible Hu Feng and his accomplices, and the thorough exposure of hidden Hu Feng elements and all other counter-revolutionary elements.

    The Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Xi'an Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened a meeting on June 13 to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. The meeting passed a resolution calling on all workers in the province to actively participate in the struggle to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, strengthen political study, raise ideological awareness, and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, increase vigilance a hundredfold to protect factories, machinery, and state secrets, and prevent all plots and sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements!

    After the third batch of materials concerning the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was published in the newspapers, it further aroused the unparalleled anger of the people of all ethnic groups and circles in Lanzhou. The Preparatory Committee of the Lanzhou Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, the Lanzhou Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League respectively denounced the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.
