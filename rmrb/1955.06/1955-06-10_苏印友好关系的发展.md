    The Development of Soviet-Indian Friendly Relations
    At the invitation of the Soviet government, Indian Prime Minister Nehru has arrived in the Soviet Union for a friendly visit. Prior to his visit to the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Nehru also visited Czechoslovakia.
    At a time when international relations are unfolding with vibrant prospects, Nehru's visit to the Soviet Union will be of great significance for enhancing international understanding and easing international tensions.
    It is no accident that the Indian people express enthusiastic support and deep expectations for their national leader's visit to the Soviet Union. In a telegram to Nehru congratulating him on his visit to the Soviet Union, Indian President Prasad said: "Our relations with that great nation are harmonious, which is gratifying, and we firmly believe that your goodwill and peace visit will further strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries and advance the peace movement." This fully expresses the Indian people's consistent and deep friendship with the Soviet people, and expresses the Indian people's desire to safeguard peace and promote international friendly cooperation.
    The Indian people's struggle for independence and freedom, and their efforts to safeguard independence and peace in recent years, have always received the sympathy and support of the Soviet people. It is well known that the great Lenin made an inspiring assessment of the international significance of the Indian people's just struggle to get rid of the shackles of colonialism. Now, India has achieved independence and established a republic. In his report on foreign policy on February 8, Comrade Molotov pointed out when discussing the new situation in Asia: "A fact of great historical significance is that colonial India no longer exists today; what exists is the Republic of India. This is an important turning point in the situation that reflects the characteristics of post-war Asia. As a new and important factor in strengthening the cause of peace and friendship among all peoples, India's international prestige is constantly increasing." This is a proper evaluation of India's status and role today, and a profound analysis of the characteristics of the development of the Asian situation.
    Such changes in the world situation and the Asian situation will inevitably be reflected in international relations, including relations between the Soviet Union and India.
    Prime Minister Nehru mentioned that he had visited the Soviet Union twenty-eight years ago. He recounted this event in his autobiography, saying that this visit "gave us a perspective of understanding," and that "she (referring to the Soviet Union) seemed to bring a message of hope to the world." Twenty-eight years later, Nehru is now visiting the Soviet Union as the Prime Minister of the Republic of India. During this period, the Soviet Union has become a powerful and prosperous socialist and highly industrialized country, and a strong fortress of world peace. India is also moving forward along the path of independent development. In the preface to the Russian translation of his book "The Discovery of India," Prime Minister Nehru said that he is now visiting the Soviet Union to "see for myself so much of what I have read, and to understand to some extent the kind of force that has built such a great and vast country in our time, with such a huge impact on the fate of the world." Prime Minister Nehru said at Moscow Airport: "I have come here to know you better and more fully. I also believe that my coming here will consolidate our relationship." Facts will once again prove that although the social systems of the Soviet Union and India are different, the friendly cooperation between the two countries will constitute an important factor in maintaining peace.
    The friendly and cooperative relationship between the Soviet Union and India is based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. In recent years, the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and India in various fields has convincingly demonstrated that as long as the relations between countries are developed in accordance with these principles, it will not only benefit the people of their own countries, but also benefit world peace.
    On the basis of these principles, economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and India is unfolding. The five-year trade agreement signed between the Soviet Union and India in December 1953 stipulates that "commercial relations between the two countries shall be developed to the greatest extent possible on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." The first year of the implementation of this agreement has increased trade between the two countries by nearly three times, which is extremely beneficial to India's economic development. Indian public opinion warmly welcomes trade relations of this nature. The "Blitz" pointed out: "India will import capital goods from the Soviet Union for the first time, allowing Asia to judge the Western lies that the Soviet Union cannot supply capital goods to backward countries." The "Hindu" said that "several commodities in India's exports to the Soviet Union have encountered difficulties in traditional markets." The "Bombay Chronicle" said: "Among all the maritime countries trading with India, the Soviet Union is the only country that allows Indian ships the right to load the largest amount of export and import goods." "Vigor" said: "Russia is the first major power to recognize the Indian rupee. This will increase the prestige of Indian currency." It is quite natural for Indian public opinion to compare the trade relations between the Soviet Union and India in this way with the trade relations of another nature between India and Western countries.
    The agreement signed between the Soviet Union and India in February this year on Soviet assistance to India in establishing a metallurgical complex with an annual output of one million tons of steel is of particular importance and has had a profound impact on Indian public opinion. This agreement is an example of the sincere assistance of the highly industrialized socialist Soviet Union to backward countries in developing their industries. This metallurgical complex includes coke oven workshops, blast furnace workshops, steelmaking workshops, rolling workshops, sintering plants and other auxiliary workshops and projects. The Soviet Union is responsible for the design work, supplying the necessary equipment, technical guidance and long-term low-interest loans, and will maximize the use of India's industry, materials, experts and labor to build this factory. This factory will become India's exclusive property. The Soviet Union will not invest in this factory and will not participate in its operation and management. This kind of selfless assistance is fundamentally different from the "assistance" of Western countries to backward countries that is attached with harsh conditions and aimed at expanding control and turning these countries into markets for investment and commodities. The "Times of India" wrote: "The Soviet-Indian agreement on the construction of a metallurgical plant is a major event in the implementation of the national construction plan."
    Economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and India eloquently proves to the world that the Soviet Union's policy of promoting international economic cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, especially helping to develop the economies of backward countries, as stated in the United Nations socio-economic agencies and in all occasions, has become a fact seen and benefited by millions of people. Imperialism is afraid that the public will see this fact and tries its best to resist and distort it, but all in vain.
    Cultural exchanges and cooperation are also constantly developing between the Soviet Union and India. The Indian people love the glorious cultural heritage of the Russian people and the great cultural treasures of Soviet socialism. Similarly, the valuable contributions made by the Indian people to the world's cultural treasury, especially the cultural achievements that reflect their tenacious struggle and creative labor, have also won the attention of the Soviet people. In recent years, the number of economic, scientific, cultural and public delegations exchanged between the two countries has continued to increase, and the exchange of science, literature, film and exhibitions has also become more frequent. The Soviet Union has published nearly one hundred books and collections of novels written by Indian writers. Cultural exchanges between India and the socialist Soviet Union are opening up unlimited and broad prospects.
    Based on the facts of their increasingly close friendly exchanges with the Soviet people, the Indian people have forcefully refuted the lies fabricated by imperialism that the Soviet Union has an "Iron Curtain." The Indian people attach importance to developing cultural relations with the Soviet Union. K. Karanjia, editor-in-chief of "Blitz Weekly," pointed out in September 1953: "The Himalayan-like obstacles built by imperialism on the road of Indian-Soviet cultural exchanges have now been swept away."
    Now, at a time when the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India are developing day by day, Indian Prime Minister Nehru's visit to the Soviet Union is a very attractive event. It is conceivable that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India will be further developed and consolidated as a result.
    The Chinese people have established and are developing a completely new type of fraternal relationship with the Soviet people, and at the same time, we are also carrying out satisfactory friendly cooperation with the Indian people. The Chinese people express their heartfelt welcome to Prime Minister Nehru's visit to the Soviet Union and the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India.

    苏印友好关系的发展
    印度总理尼赫鲁应苏联政府的邀请，已到苏联作友好的访问。在访问苏联之前，尼赫鲁总理还访问了捷克斯洛伐克。
    正当目前的国际关系开展着生动的前景的时候，尼赫鲁访问苏联之行，对于增进国际间的了解和缓和国际紧张局势的努力，将具有重要的意义。
    印度人民对他们的国家领袖的访问苏联，表示热烈的支持并寄予深切的期望，这不是偶然的。印度总统普拉沙德在给尼赫鲁祝他访问苏联的电报中说：“我们同那个伟大的国家的关系是融洽的，这是值得庆幸的，我们深信，您的这次亲善与和平访问将进一步加强我们两国之间的友好关系并推进和平运动。”这充分地表达了印度人民对苏联人民一贯的深厚的友谊，表达了印度人民努力维护和平和促进国际友好合作的愿望。
    印度人民争取独立自由的斗争，和这几年来维护独立和和平的努力，一直就得到苏联人民的同情和支持。伟大的列宁对印度人民摆脱殖民主义枷锁的正义斗争的国际意义，曾作过感人的估价，这是大家所熟知的。现在，印度已取得了独立，建立了共和国。莫洛托夫同志二月八日在外交政策报告中指出亚洲发生的新局势时说：“一个具有巨大历史意义的事实是：今天，殖民地的印度已不再存在，存在的是印度共和国了。这是表现战后亚洲发展的特点的局势中的一个重要转折。作为加强和平和各国人民友谊的事业中的一个新的重要因素，印度的国际威望正在不断提高。”这是对今天印度的地位和作用的恰当的评价，也是对亚洲局势发展特点的深刻的分析。
    世界局势和亚洲局势所发生的这种变化，不可避免地要在国际关系包括苏联和印度间的关系中反映出来。
    尼赫鲁总理说到他曾在二十八年前访问过苏联。他在自传中记述了这件事，说这次访问“给予了我们一个远景的认识”，“她（指苏联）似乎给世界带来了希望的音讯。”二十八年后，尼赫鲁现在是以印度共和国的总理的身份访问苏联。在这一时期内，苏联已成了强大和繁荣的社会主义高度工业化国家，成了世界和平的坚强堡垒。印度也正在沿着独立发展的道路前进。尼赫鲁总理在最近给他的著作“印度的发现”的俄译本写的序言中，说他现在访问苏联，是要“亲自看到我所读过的那么多的东西，以及在某种程度上了解那样一种力量，这种力量曾在我们时代中建立了一个如此伟大的和辽阔的、对全世界命运有着如此巨大影响的国家。”尼赫鲁总理在莫斯科机场表示：“我到这里来，是为了更好地更多地了解你们。我也相信，我到这里来将巩固我们的关系。”事实将会再次证明，苏印两国的社会制度尽管不同，但是两国的友好合作将构成维护和平的一个重要因素。
    苏联和印度之间的友好合作关系，是建立在互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处等项原则之上的。最近几年来，苏联和印度之间在各方面的友好合作关系的发展，令人信服地证明：只要本着这些原则来发展各国之间的关系，就不仅对本国的人民有利，而且对世界和平有利。
    在这些原则的基础上，苏联和印度之间的经济合作正在展开。一九五三年十二月，苏联和印度缔结的五年贸易协定，规定“在平等和互利的基础上，最大限度地发展两国间的商业关系。”这个协定执行的第一年，已使两国间的贸易，在对印度经济发展极其有利的情况下，增加了将近三倍。印度舆论热烈欢迎这样性质的贸易关系。“闪电报”指出：“印度将第一次从苏联输入资本财，从而让亚洲判明西方所谓苏联不能以资本财供给落后国家的谰言”。“印度教徒报”说，印度输往苏联的商品中“有几种商品已在传统的市场上遇到了困难”。“孟买纪事报”说：“在一切与印度通商的海运国家中，苏联是唯一能让印度船只有权最大量地装载输出和输入货物的一个国家”。“活力报”说：“俄国是第一个承认印度卢比的大国。这将提高印度货币的威信”。印度舆论这样地把苏印两国贸易关系跟印度同西方国家的另一性质的贸易关系对照起来看，是十分自然的事。
    今年二月间苏联和印度签订的关于苏联帮助印度建立一个年产一百万吨钢的冶金联合工厂的协定，具有特别的重要性，它在印度舆论中引起了深刻的影响。这个协定是社会主义高度工业化的苏联真诚帮助落后国家发展工业的范例。这个冶金联合工厂包括炼焦车间、高炉车间、炼钢车间、轧钢车间、烧结装置以及其他辅助车间和工程。苏联负责设计工作，供给必要的设备，技术指导和长期低利贷款，并将最大限度地利用印度的工业、物资、专家和劳动力来建立这个工厂。这家工厂将成为印度的独有财产。苏联将不对这家工厂进行投资，不参加它的经营管理。这种无私的援助，和西方国家对落后国家附以苛刻条件和目的在于扩张控制势力、变这些国家为投资和商品市场的“援助”根本不能同日而语。“印度时报”写道：“苏、印关于建设冶金工厂的协定是执行国家建设计划中的重大事件”。
    苏联和印度之间的经济合作，向全世界雄辩地证明：苏联在联合国社会经济机构和所有场合所表明的愿在平等互利的基础上促进国际经济合作、特别是帮助发展落后国家经济的政策，已经成为千百万人所看到的和得到了好处的事实。帝国主义害怕公众看到这个事实，竭力加以抵制和曲解，但都是徒然的。
    文化的交流和合作，在苏联和印度之间也不断发展起来。印度人民热爱俄罗斯人民光辉的文化遗产和苏联社会主义伟大文化宝藏。同样地，印度人民对世界文化宝库所作的有价值的贡献，特别是反映他们的顽强斗争和创造性劳动的文化成果，也博得了苏联人民的重视。这几年来，两国互派的经济、科学、文化和公众代表团不断增加，科学、文学、电影和展览的交流也日益频繁。苏联已出版了将近一百种印度作家写的书和小说集。印度同社会主义苏联的文化的交流，开辟着不可限量的宽广前途。
    印度人民根据自己同苏联人民日益密切地友好往来的事实，有力地驳斥了帝国主义捏造的所谓苏联有“铁幕”的谎言。印度人民重视发展同苏联的文化关系。“闪电周刊”主编卡朗吉亚在一九五三年九月就指出：“帝国主义在印苏文化交流的道路上所筑起的喜马拉雅山似的障碍，现在已被扫除了。”
    现在，正当苏、印两国友好关系日益发展的时候，印度总理尼赫鲁访问苏联，这是十分吸引人心的事件。可以想见，苏印两国的友好关系必将因而得到进一步的发展和巩固。
    中国人民已经同苏联人民建立了和发展着完全新型的兄弟般的关系，同时，我们也正在同印度人民之间开展着满意的友好合作事业。中国人民对于尼赫鲁总理的访问苏联，对于苏印两国友好关系的发展，表示衷心欢迎。
