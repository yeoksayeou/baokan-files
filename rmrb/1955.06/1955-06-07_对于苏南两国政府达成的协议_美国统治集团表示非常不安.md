Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 5th: TASS reports from Washington on June 5th: U.S. State Department spokesman, Mr. Sultam, refused on the 3rd to comment on newspaper reports that the U.S. government is considering inviting President Tito to Washington for talks. In response to questions from reporters, Sultam said that the suggestion of a meeting between the Western Three Powers and Yugoslavia is “still under discussion.”

New York "American Journal" Washington correspondent, Sentner, reported that the agreement reached between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in Belgrade has plunged some people in the U.S. State Department into a state of "dimness." Sentner wrote that the State Department is "hesitating on a path of diplomatic darkness." He also said that the United States has always intended to "prevent a rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia."

The "New York Post" said that "Washington is frantically studying" the events that occurred in Belgrade, "and experts are expressing alarm over the fact that Moscow and Belgrade are still friends."

The "Daily Mirror" either launches insulting attacks on Yugoslavia, or makes various speculations and inferences, claiming that the normalization of Soviet-Yugoslav relations may affect "Europe's military potential."

According to a United Press report, Senate Republican Leader, Mr. Knowland, said that the Soviet-Yugoslav talks are "a serious blow" to the United States and its allies. Knowland attacked Yugoslavia and indicated that the United States views Yugoslavia as an important factor in its war plans.

    对于苏南两国政府达成的协议
    美国统治集团表示非常不安
    新华社五日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿五日讯：美国国务院发言人苏丹姆三日拒绝评论报纸上发表的关于美国政府正在考虑邀请铁托总统来华盛顿会谈的消息。苏丹姆在回答记者的问题时说，关于西方三国同南斯拉夫举行会谈的建议“还在讨论中”。
    纽约“美国人日报”驻华盛顿记者森特纳报道说，苏联和南斯拉夫在贝尔格莱德达成的协议使美国国务院的一些人士陷于“黯然失色”的境地。森特纳写道，国务院“正在外交黑暗的路途上踌躇”。他并且说，美国一直是打算“防止苏联和南斯拉夫之间的接近的”。
    “纽约邮报”说，“华盛顿正在狂热地研究”在贝尔格莱德发生的事件，“而且专家们都在对莫斯科和贝尔格莱德仍旧是朋友这件事表示惊惶不安”。
    “每日镜报”不是对南斯拉夫进行侮辱性的攻击，就是作出种种揣测和推断，说什么苏南关系的正常化可能影响“欧洲的军事潜力”。
    据合众社报道，参议院共和党领袖诺兰说，苏南会谈对美国和它的盟国是“一个严重的打击”。诺兰攻击南斯拉夫，他并且表明，美国是把南斯拉夫看成自己的战争计划中的一个重要因素的。
