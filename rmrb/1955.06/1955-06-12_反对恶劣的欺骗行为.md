    Oppose Heinous Deceptive Practices
    Mao Lin
    The Cangxian Livestock Products Branch Company of Hebei Province has a total of sixty-seven employees, and the living quarters only cover 278 square meters. The cafeteria, dormitory, and office are all squeezed together. The company's employees tried to overcome the difficulties in their lives to save investment for the country. However, the goods did not have a suitable storage place, which inevitably led to losses. Therefore, they requested instructions from the Hebei Provincial Livestock Products Company (hereinafter referred to as the Provincial Company), requesting the construction of a temporary simple shed of 480 square meters, with a planned investment of 6,500 yuan.
    The Provincial Company did not agree to this plan, nor did it consult with the Cangxian Livestock Products Branch Company. Instead, it directly compiled a construction plan with a total investment of 68,400 yuan, which was more than nine times the original plan. The plan included warehouses, offices, factory sheds, hide curing rooms, casing processing rooms, walls, land purchase, and earth filling.
    This plan was reviewed and approved by the Hebei Provincial Foreign Trade Bureau and reported to the China Livestock Products Company (hereinafter referred to as the General Company). The General Company felt that this plan was relatively large, but it did not understand the specific situation and could not make a decision. Coincidentally, the head of the Planning Section of the Provincial Company was in Beijing for this matter, and the General Company repeatedly discussed with him whether it could be saved further, but the head of the Planning Section of the Provincial Company firmly said: "It cannot be reduced at all." The General Company asked him to go back and consider it carefully again. Not long after the head of the Planning Section of the Provincial Company returned, he submitted the planning task book, and the investment figure was still 68,400 yuan.
    Later, the General Company sent someone to investigate and learned that the 68,400 yuan investment plan compiled by the Provincial Company was very dishonest. In terms of the unit cost of construction, the price originally reported in the plan was far from the actual price of the local construction engineering company, with some differences as large as two or three times. The original reported cost of the warehouse was 80 yuan per square meter, but it actually only needed 60 yuan. The original reported cost of the office was 70 yuan per square meter, but it actually only needed 50 yuan. The original reported land price per mu was 200 yuan, but it actually only needed 50 yuan. In terms of construction projects, the Cangxian Livestock Products Branch Company's business scope mainly involved signing consignment purchase contracts with cooperatives, so in the operation of hides, it only needed to select and sort them, and there was no need for hide curing and drying. However, the Provincial Company compiled a plan to build a hide curing room. In reality, it was only necessary to expand the existing foundation by about four mu to the south, but the Provincial Company proposed a plan to purchase 15 mu of land for new construction. In total, the over-reporting and false reporting of costs amounted to more than 23,000 yuan.
    The above facts show that the Hebei Provincial Company has serious departmentalism. They were single-mindedly trying to get more money from the country and did not hesitate to adopt heinous deceptive means. The reason why the Hebei Provincial Foreign Trade Bureau approved this wasteful plan was also because they harbored ulterior motives. Originally, the higher authorities stipulated that investments of more than 50,000 yuan belonged to capital construction and were directly controlled and allocated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade; investments of less than 50,000 yuan belonged to piecemeal capital construction and were paid from local piecemeal capital construction funds. They believed that local funds were "theirs," while the central funds seemed to be "someone else's," so they tried every means to have the central government allocate the funds. They forgot that they were socialist enterprises and resorted to bourgeois methods to "harm others to benefit themselves." In our socialist construction cause, this is a criminal act and cannot be tolerated.

    反对恶劣的欺骗行为
    卯林
    河北省沧县畜产分公司共有职工六十七人，住的房子只有二百七十八平方公尺，食堂、宿舍、办公室都挤在一起。公司的职工为了给国家节省投资，想办法克服了生活上的困难。但是，货物没有适当的堆放处，不免要遭受损失，因此曾请示河北省畜产公司（下称省公司），要求修建一个四百八十平方公尺的临时简单仓棚，计划需投资六千五百元。
    省公司没有同意这个计划，也没有同沧县畜产分公司商议，就直接代编了一个投资总额六万八千四百元的建筑计划，比原计划大九倍还多。计划中包括仓库、办公室、厂棚、腌皮室、肠衣加工房、围墙、购地基、垫土方等项目。
    这个计划经河北省对外贸易局审核同意后报到中国畜产公司（下称总公司）。总公司感到这个计划较大，但不了解具体情况，不能作决定。恰好省公司计划科负责人正为此事来北京，总公司同他一再研究是否可以再节省一些，但省公司计划科负责人肯定地说：“一点也不能减少。”总公司又请他回去再仔细考虑一下。省公司计划科负责人回去不久，就报来了计划任务书，投资数字仍然是六万八千四百元。
    后来，总公司派人前往了解，才知道省公司代编的这个六万八千四百元投资计划是很不老实的。在建筑的单位造价方面，计划中原报价格和当地建筑工程公司的实际价格相差很远，有的竟相差二、三倍。原报仓库造价每平方公尺是八十元，实际只需要六十元。办公室原报造价每平方公尺是七十元，实际只需要五十元。地基每亩地价原报二百元，实际只需要五十元。在建筑的项目中，沧县畜产分公司经营的范围主要是和合作社签订委托代购合同，因此在皮张的经营上只是挑选分路，不需要腌皮晾晒，但省公司却给代编上建筑腌皮室的计划。地基实际只要在现有地基南面扩展约四亩多就可以了，而省公司却提出全部新建购地十五亩的计划。总共多报和虚报造价达二万三千余元。
    以上的事实说明河北省公司有严重的本位主义思想，他们一心想向国家多要钱，不惜采取恶劣的欺骗手段。而河北省对外贸易局所以审核同意这个浪费的计划，也因为他们抱着一种不可告人的目的。原来，上级规定，五万元以上的投资属于基本建设，由对外贸易部直接掌握拨款；五万元以下的投资属于零星基本建设，由地方的零星基本建设款项中支付。他们认为地方的资金是“我”的，中央的资金似乎是“别人”的，因此尽量想办法要由中央来拨付。他们忘记了自己是社会主义的企业，竟采取资产阶级的手法来“损人利己”。在我们的社会主义建设事业中，这是一种犯罪的行为，是不能容许的。
