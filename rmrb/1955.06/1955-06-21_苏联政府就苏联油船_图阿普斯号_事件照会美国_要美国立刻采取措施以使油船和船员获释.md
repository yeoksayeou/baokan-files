Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 19th: The Soviet Embassy in the United States delivered a note to the U.S. State Department on June 18th regarding the hijacking of the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse."

The note pointed out: The Soviet government has repeatedly protested to the U.S. government regarding the hijacking of the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse," urging the U.S. government to pay attention and take measures to immediately return the oil tanker, its cargo, and its crew. The Soviet government has done so based on the fact that the sea area where the Soviet oil tanker was attacked is entirely under the control of the U.S. Navy, and therefore the U.S. government bears full responsibility for the hijacking of the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse."

However, the U.S. government has not yet taken measures to release the oil tanker "Tuapse" and its crew.

Moreover, according to reports in the American newspapers, U.S. authorities are attempting to prevent the crew of the "Tuapse" oil tanker from returning to their homeland and are using the excuse of granting them "political asylum" to cover up these illegal actions. The aforementioned newspaper reports have not been denied by the U.S. government to date.

According to information obtained from the crew of the Polish merchant ship "President Gottwald," the crew of the "Tuapse" oil tanker are being subjected to violence and ridicule; all of this is to prevent them from returning to their homeland. These actions against the crew of the Soviet "Tuapse" oil tanker, which was hijacked in a sea area under the control of the U.S. Navy, are a blatant violation of recognized norms of international law.

The Soviet government protests the aforementioned actions taken by the U.S. government against the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" and its crew and hopes that the U.S. government will immediately take measures to release the oil tanker and its crew.

    苏联政府就苏联油船“图阿普斯号”事件照会美国
    要美国立刻采取措施以使油船和船员获释
    新华社二十日讯 据塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：苏联驻美国大使馆六月十八日把关于苏联油船“图阿普斯号”被劫夺事件的照会一件，交给美国国务院。
    照会指出：苏联政府曾几次就苏联油船“图阿普斯号”被劫夺事向美国政府提出抗议，促请美国政府注意，必须采取措施立即交还这只油船及它的货物和船员。苏联政府这样做是从下面的事实出发的：苏联油船遭受袭击的海面完全处于美国海军的控制之下，因此美国政府对苏联油船“图阿普斯号”的被劫夺负有全部责任。
    但是美国政府迄今没有采取措施，以使油船“图阿普斯号”和它的船员获释。
    不但如此，据美国报纸报道，美国当局正企图阻止“图阿普斯号”油船的船员返回他们的祖国，而且用给与他们“政治避难”的说法来掩饰这些非法的行动。上述报纸消息到现在为止还没有为美国政府所否认。
    根据从波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德总统号”船员得到的情报，“图阿普斯号”油船的船员正遭受暴力和嘲弄；所有这一切都是为了阻止他们返回他们的祖国。对在美国海军控制下的海面上被劫夺的苏联“图阿普斯号”油船船员的这种行动，粗暴地违反了公认的国际法准则。
    苏联政府抗议美国政府对苏联油船“图阿普斯号”及其船员所采取的上述行动，并希望美国政府立刻采取措施，以使这艘油船及其船员获释。
