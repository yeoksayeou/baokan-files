Can't these things be managed?

    To the Editor:

    Along the newly built Fengsha Railway, one can often see groups of three or five people carrying large bundles of cement paper bags, or driving donkeys loaded with them. Where did these paper bags come from? They all say, "Picked them up."

    When the Fengsha Railway line began construction, it was stipulated that cement bags should be collected and turned in. Why are people still picking up large quantities of paper bags? It turns out that this regulation has not been effective on the construction site. They say, "This is a large project with many workers, who can manage these things!" Therefore, many construction units throw away the paper bags after using the cement. When nearby residents discovered this, they came in groups to pick up the paper bags. They bundled the picked-up paper bags and transported them to large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin to sell. The people on the construction site are turning a blind eye to this phenomenon. The Fengsha line has been under construction for more than two years, and it is impossible to calculate how many cement paper bags have been lost in these two years.

    Now, the project here is nearing completion. The personnel on the construction site are about to transfer to new construction sites to carry out new tasks. If they continue to be so indifferent to the loss of state property, it will inevitably continue to cause great waste.

    Our socialist construction undertaking requires a large amount of funds, which must be accumulated bit by bit by the people of the whole country. Throwing away a batch of paper bags may be a small matter for some people; however, in these small places, if we don't pay attention, over time, the amount will be considerable. I want to remind the responsible comrades of the Fengsha line construction site that when they transfer to new construction sites to carry out new tasks, they should pay close attention to cherishing state property.

### 管不了这些事吗？

    管不了这些事吗？编辑同志：
    在新建的丰沙铁路沿线，时常可以遇见三五成群的人背着大捆的水泥纸袋，或者赶着驴子驮着。那里来的这些纸袋呢？他们都说：“捡来的”。
    在丰沙铁路线开始修建的时候，曾规定了水泥袋要收存上缴。为什么还有人捡到大批纸袋呢？原来这个规定在工地上并没有发生作用。他们说：“这里工程大、工人多，谁能管得了这些事呢！”因此，有不少的施工单位在用完水泥以后，就随手把纸袋扔掉。附近的居民发现了，就成群结队地来捡纸袋。他们把捡到的纸袋打成捆，运到北京、天津等大城市去卖。工地上的人们对于这种现象却熟视无睹。丰沙线施工已经两年多了，在这两年多的过程中究竟丢掉了多少只水泥纸袋，那就无法计算了。
    现在，这里的工程快要完工了。工地的人员就将要转移到新的工地执行新的任务去了。如果他们仍然这样不关心国家财产的损失，一定会继续造成很大的浪费。
    我们的社会主义建设事业，需要大量资金，要靠全国人民一点一滴地积累起来。扔掉一批纸袋，对于某些人来说，可能是小事；可是就在这些细小的地方，如果不注意的话，日久天长，计算起来，数目就很可观。我要提醒丰沙线工地的负责同志，在他们转移到新的工地执行新任务的时候，要好好注意爱护国家的财产。
