    Liu Jiuxue's coal mining team, a nationally renowned model team for safe coal production, has completed its coal production plan for the first half of this year nineteen days ahead of schedule. The entire team is working hard to produce an additional 10,000 tons of raw coal for the country during these nineteen days as a gift to celebrate the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
    As a result of continuously improving labor organization and strictly preventing accidents, the production efficiency of Liu Jiuxue's coal mining team has been continuously improved. The average daily coal production in February was 5.2 tons, which increased to more than 7.5 tons in May, and reached 8.26 tons in the first half of June. They also pay attention to saving raw materials, and have saved more than 30,000 yuan in costs in the first half of the year.

    刘九学采煤队完成上半年计划
    全国著名的煤矿安全生产模范刘九学领导的采煤队，已经提前十九天完成了今年上半年的产煤计划。全队工人正努力争取在这十九天内为国家增产原煤一万吨，作为对中国共产党诞生三十四周年纪念的献礼。
    刘九学采煤队不断改进劳动组织和严格防止事故的结果，生产效率不断提高。二月份平均每个工作日采煤五点二吨，五月份就提高到七吨半还多，六月上半月又达到了八点二六吨。他们也很注意节省原材料，上半年已经节省成本费用三万多元。
