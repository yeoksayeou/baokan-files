Criticism and Suggestions Response

    The counter-revolutionary element Liu Puguan, hidden in the Shanxi Provincial Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School, has been arrested and Qi Fengshan has been executed.
    Li Da and Guo Jianying of the Shanxi Provincial People's Procuratorate wrote: After the People's Daily published the reader's letter "Political Apathy is an Unforgivable Oversight" on March 6th, the Shanxi Provincial People's Procuratorate conducted a thorough investigation and arrested the counter-revolutionary element Liu Puguan, who was hiding in the medical office of the Shanxi Provincial Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School, on May 22nd according to law.
    The criminal Liu Puguan served as a medical officer in the Yan Xishan puppet army before liberation and also acted as the head of the military medical department. He directly led a platoon of bandit troops, consistently extorting, blackmailing, burning, killing, and looting, committing all kinds of evil. From 1945 to 1946, when Liu was acting as the head of the puppet military medical department in Qin County, he masterminded the arrest of our underground workers Yan Fuwang, Yan Xiuzhang, etc. On October 24, 1945, Liu condoned his subordinates in capturing Zhang Huaijin of Duanzhuang Village to be used as a live target. After Liu was arrested, the Shanxi Provincial People's Court is currently conducting a trial.
    Furthermore: The counter-revolutionary element Qi Fengshan, who abused his power to rape female students, was arrested and interrogated by the Shanxi Provincial People's Court. It was proven that the materials revealed by readers Sun Xueli and Zhang Ronghua were completely true, and many materials confirmed that the criminal Qi was indeed a consistently reactionary and extremely evil counter-revolutionary element. The Shanxi Provincial Higher People's Court decided to sentence the criminal to death. The sentence was pronounced and executed on May 28th.

    暗藏在山西省工农速成中学的反革命分子祁凤山已处死刑
    山西省人民检察院李达、郭健英来信：人民日报于三月六日发表了“政治麻痹是不可饶恕的过失”的读者来信后，经山西省人民检察院的缜密侦查，已于五月二十二日依法将隐藏在山西省工农速成中学校医室的反革命分子刘普光予以逮捕。
    刘犯普光在解放前曾任阎伪军医官，并代军医处长职。他直接带领一个排的匪军，一贯敲诈、勒索、烧杀、抢劫，无恶不作。一九四五年到一九四六年间，刘犯在沁县代任伪军医处长职务时，曾主谋策划抓捕我方地下工作人员阎福旺、阎秀章等，一九四五年十月二十四日，刘犯曾纵容其部下把我段庄村的张怀金抓去打活人靶。刘犯被逮捕后，山西省人民法院正在审讯处理中。
    又：利用职权强奸女生的反革命分子祁凤山，经山西省人民法院逮捕审讯后，证明读者孙学理、张荣华所揭发的材料完全真实，许多材料证实祁犯确系一贯反动、作恶多端的反革命分子。山西省高级人民法院决定判处该犯以死刑。已于五月二十八日宣判执行。
