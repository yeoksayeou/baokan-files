Achievements in Thrift, But Waste Remains Significant
    Li Zhuping, Director of the Basic Construction Bureau, Ministry of Textile Industry
    Chen Jun, Deputy Director

    The construction cost of the Ministry of Textile Industry has been decreasing year by year in recent years. Taking the reinforced concrete structure factory buildings of the three state-owned cotton textile factories in Beijing as an example, the actual civil construction cost per square meter of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory in 1953 was 131 yuan, which decreased to 105 yuan for the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory in 1954, and the design budget for the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory in 1955 was 96 yuan. The actual civil construction cost per square meter of the family dormitory of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory was 86 yuan, about 74 yuan for the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, and the design estimate for the Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory was 65 yuan. These achievements are inseparable from the efforts of the design and construction departments. However, even so, the data inspected in the winter of last year and the spring of this year prove that the phenomenon of waste in the construction of textile factories is still very serious.

    From the perspective of planning work, because we were satisfied with the annual reduction of material, labor, and cost quotas, we did not continue to study in-depth and explore the potential that has not yet been utilized. We did not, according to the country's investment policy, realistically study the investment projects and the quotas and standards of each project with relevant parties, so the plan was not practical. For example, the investment plan of the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, which has already started trial production, was reviewed again last November. Some unnecessary engineering projects were reduced, and some excessively high standards were lowered, which reduced the investment by 8.24 million yuan. At the same time, the omitted items were supplemented, and the standards that were too low were raised, which also increased by 6.1 million yuan. After offsetting the increase and decrease, the investment was still reduced by 2.14 million yuan. Inaccurate planning not only makes it difficult to implement and check the plan, but also opens the door to extravagance and waste. Because if the items are listed less, they will inevitably be added, and if they are listed more, they can be wasted "legally." The factory canteens of Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Northwest No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, and Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, which were built in 1953, could have used the canteens in the living area or the factory, but these four factories still spent 439,000 yuan more to build new canteens. In 1954, the cadre quota for a factory with 100,000 spindles and more than 2,000 looms was 425 people, including full-time staff of the Party, trade union, and Youth League, totaling about 460 people. This year's plan is 566 people. After studying it recently, 400 people are enough. Because more than 100 people are listed, more offices and dormitories need to be added, which requires about 300,000 yuan for each factory. This plan has recently been revised. Last year, the civil construction cost per square meter of the semi-prefabricated reinforced concrete sawtooth single-story factory building of Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory was initially stipulated as 150 yuan, then changed to 125 yuan, the design budget was 121 yuan, and the actual cost was only about 105 yuan. The cost of the family dormitory of Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory was initially stipulated as 83 yuan per square meter, then changed to 77 yuan, and the actual cost was only about 74 yuan. Other budgets for furniture, appliances, machine parts, materials, and preparatory expenses also have excessive, overly broad, and overly good phenomena. The construction department also has an excuse that "if we don't waste, we can't complete the national investment plan"!

    In the past two years, many architects have had a tendency to simply pursue the beauty of the facade and the complicated decoration, disregarding economic efficiency and applicability, advocating retroism and formalism. The Basic Construction Bureau has criticized these tendencies to some extent, but has not carried out a serious and necessary mass struggle. Even in some buildings, it agreed to adopt the so-called "national form," which has promoted the development of these tendencies. For example, the glazed tiles of Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory are strips, and those of No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory are wider. The Textile Science Research Institute has completely become a temple-style large roof (now changed). The gatehouse of Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and the nursery of Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory adopt the so-called Han Dynasty architectural form, which wastes manpower and materials, and makes people feel heavy and unpleasant. Many residential corridors are winding, but the housing is too small and the kitchen is not enough. The design in the past two years has proved that repeatedly using standard design is an effective measure to complete tasks and save design power, but some people still want to build a "monument" every year, and adopt a variety of designs for many prefabricated components without any reason, which wastes manpower and materials. The waste in electrical design is also serious. As soon as you enter the factory, there are lights everywhere. The living area of Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory uses underground cables, which increases the investment by more than 100,000 yuan. There are also too many and too good tools, appliances, and instruments.

    In terms of materials, in addition to poor storage and improper use, the phenomenon of backlog and waste is also very serious. At the end of last year, the value of materials backlogged on the four major construction sites was 6.64 million yuan. In finance, there is no accurate plan in advance, no control during use, and no audit afterwards. Once the money is spent, it is considered to have completed the task. This also opens the door to extravagance and waste.

    The recently inspected data show that the construction company directly under the Basic Construction Bureau has a lot of idleness due to imperfect labor organization in the past year. It is estimated that the waste of labor force is about 100,000 yuan. The waste of rework and repair is also very large. From April to December last year, there were 96 reworks, more than half of which were due to incorrect construction guidance and poor construction, with an estimated loss of more than 11,000 yuan.

    The extravagance and waste of construction units are also very serious. The preparatory expenses of Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory can be saved by at least 20,000 yuan. It cost 7,300 yuan for the opening ceremony, which is too much. Some of the bedside tables, cupboard and curtain cloth in the dormitory can be reduced, and some can be eliminated. The factory originally listed 30,000 yuan for greening the environment, which was already too much, and then increased it to 60,000 yuan last year. We did not even review it. By the spring of this year, a total of 41,000 yuan was spent, including two unplanned fountains, which cost more than 11,000 yuan, more than 60 kinds of flowering trees, some of which cost as much as 50 yuan each, and even 17.5 catties of goldfish were included in the basic construction investment. There are also many inappropriate expenditures in Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. For example, 20 barbers bought 104 razors and hair clippers, and 128 knives, which can be used for 40 years. Other preparatory units also have similar situations. For example, Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory disliked the 160-yuan sofa sets made by themselves, and spent 2,100 yuan to buy five sets of leather sofas in Tianjin; instruments must be bought from foreign countries; and there is even more waste in temporary buildings.

    Why do these problems arise? In addition to the lack of experience and the insufficient accuracy of the data provided by some units, the main reason is that the leading staff of the Basic Construction Bureau and some staff under the leadership of the Bureau have not seriously studied the investment policies of the Party and the state, rationally and economically used national accumulation, carefully calculated the utilization rate of various buildings and equipment, and did not consider the relationship between the use of investment and the promotion of national industrialization and the development of the national economy, blindly pursuing high standards. They believe that since the newly built factory is a socialist enterprise, everything must be large, more, new, good, and complete. Not only must the life, welfare, and cultural and recreational work of employees be taken care of, but also the affiliated enterprises are as many as possible. The new factories built under this ideological guidance not only waste national funds, resulting in high depreciation and maintenance costs, but also affect the worker-peasant alliance, because the difference between the lives of workers and peasants is too great.

    Under the circumstances that the basic construction investment is reduced year by year and the tasks are completed year by year, some comrades are easy to appreciate their achievements and do not treat their work conscientiously and cautiously, discover and correct the shortcomings and errors in their work in time to improve their work. As a result, the quality of some construction sites declined last year, and the number of quality accidents in design increased compared with 1953. Following the complacent mood is conservative thinking, failing to see new things, failing to seriously study the huge savings potential in various working links of the construction process; and failing to see that the gradual decline in the price of machinery and building materials is a major factor in saving basic construction investment, so the calculation of the construction and installation cost of each project tends to be conservative.

    The leading personnel of the Basic Construction Bureau have a serious bureaucratic style. They have not seriously organized the review of basic construction plans and various design documents, have not timely checked and summarized the work in design and construction, and have not timely formulated standards for furniture, appliances, equipment, dormitories, preparatory expenses, training expenses, etc. of a factory based on practical experience. This not only makes it difficult for comrades who prepare and review the plan, but also makes us countless in our hearts, blindly trusting the incorrect opinions of some staff, and promoting their extravagant and wasteful ideas.

    In order to eliminate the waste in the basic construction department and practice thrift, the Ministry of Textile Industry has designated all departments of basic construction to conduct a mass anti-waste inspection at the basic construction meeting in December last year and the factory director meeting this spring, and use the revealed materials to combine the spirit of the central government's previous instructions on saving the use of national accumulation and Comrade Khrushchev's report at the All-Soviet Construction Conference to conduct a study. Gradually formulate various standards and quotas, review the construction projects of each newly built enterprise one by one, and carefully revise the investment plan. Facts have proved that this is effective. For example, the investment plan of Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory is 14.06% lower than that of No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. From January to April 12 this year, the design company has been constantly reviewing and revising the completed designs, saving 1.24 million yuan for the country. After inspecting the waste, the administrative leaders of Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory made a review at the general meeting of all employees and actively dealt with those excessively purchased furniture, appliances, and instruments. If they have not been built or bought, they will not be built or bought. The engineering company has also studied some saving measures in response to the various waste situations in the past to ensure that the cost is reduced by 3.5% on the basis of the design budget. Therefore, this year's design quota has been greatly improved compared with last year, and the factory building cost budget has been reduced by about 25% compared with last year.

    The Ministry of Textile Industry also instructed the basic construction department to strengthen and establish the financial, cost, and material management work of both parties, strengthen plan management and technical management, reorganize the company's structure, strictly control the labor plan, improve labor organization, and reduce or eliminate the open and secret idleness on the construction site. In order to better correct the various errors in the past design work and overcome waste, the design department must also systematically go deep into the already built factories and solicit the opinions of the masses on the design as the basis for future improvement. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and the higher authorities, and under the supervision of the masses, it is possible to gradually correct the shortcomings and errors in the work.

    节约有成绩，浪费还很大
    纺织工业部基本建设局局长  李竹平
                      副局长　陈钧
    纺织工业部基本建设工程造价，几年来是逐年降低的。以北京三个国营棉纺织厂的钢筋混凝土结构厂房为例，一九五三年第一棉纺织厂每平方公尺的实际土建造价为一百三十一元，一九五四年第二棉纺织厂降为一百○五元，一九五五年第三棉纺织厂的设计预算为九十六元。北京国棉一厂的眷属宿舍每平方公尺的实际土木建筑造价为八十六元，北京国棉二厂为七十四元左右，北京国棉三厂的设计预计为六十五元。这些成绩的取得，是跟设计、施工等部门职工的努力分不开的。但即使这样，去年冬季和今年春季所检查的资料证明，纺织工厂建设中的浪费现象仍然是很严重的。
    从计划工作方面来检查，由于满足于材料、人工及费用定额逐年降低的结果，就没有继续深入研究和发掘目前尚未被利用的潜力，没有根据国家的投资政策，实事求是地跟有关方面研究各个建设单位的投资项目和各个项目的定额、标准，因而计划编得不切合实际。如已经开始试车生产的北京国棉二厂的投资计划，经过去年十一月份重新审查，削减了一些不必要的工程项目，降低了某些过高的标准，就核减了投资八百二十四万元，同时，因漏列项目要补充，标准过低的要提高，也增加了六百一十万元。增减相抵，还减少投资二百一十四万元。计划不准确，不仅给执行和检查计划带来困难，也给铺张浪费开了方便之门。因为项目少列了势必追加，而多列的则就可以“合法”浪费了。一九五三年建设的北京国棉一厂、石家庄国棉一厂、西北国棉三厂、郑州国棉一厂等厂的厂区食堂，是可以利用生活区或工场内食堂的，但是这四个厂仍然多花了四十三万九千元盖新的食堂。一九五四年干部定额，一个十万纱锭、二千多台布机的工厂为四百二十五人，连党、工会、青年团的专职工作人员在内，约计四百六十多人，今年计划却为五百六十六人，最近研究了一下，只要四百人就够了。因为多列了一百多人，就要多增加办公室和宿舍，每个厂需要三十万元左右，这个计划最近已经修改。去年北京国棉二厂的半装配式的钢筋混凝土锯齿形单层厂房的土建造价，每平方公尺开始规定为一百五十元，后改为一百二十五元，设计预算为一百二十一元，实际造价只为一百○五元左右，北京国棉二厂眷属宿舍造价，开始规定每平方公尺为八十三元，后改为七十七元，实际造价仅为七十四元左右。其他在家具、器具、机器配件机物料及筹建费等预算方面，也都有过多、过宽、过好的现象。建设部门还有一种借口，认为“不浪费就完不成国家投资计划”！
    最近两年来，不少建筑师有单纯追求立面美观和繁琐装饰的不顾经济和适用的复古主义和形式主义倾向，基本建设局对这些倾向，虽进行过一些批评，但没有开展过严肃的必要的群众性的斗争，甚至在某些建筑上同意过采用所谓“民族形式”，因而助长了这些倾向的发展。如北京国棉一厂的琉璃瓦是一带条子，国棉二厂的就宽些了，纺织科学研究馆就完全变成了庙宇式的大屋顶（现已改掉），北京国棉一厂的门楼，北京国棉二厂的托儿所，是采用所谓汉代建筑形式，浪费了人力和物力，使人看起来感到沉重和不愉快。不少住宅的走廊曲曲折折，但是住房太小，厨房不够用。从两年来的设计中，证明重复利用标准设计，是完成任务与节约设计力量的有效措施，但还有人想一年树一个“纪念碑”，对许多预制构件，也毫无理由地采用多种多样的设计，浪费了人力和物力。电气设计上的浪费也是严重的，一进工厂，到处是灯。北京国棉二厂的生活区采用地缆线，增加投资十万多元；工具、器具、仪器等，也都有过多过好的现象。
    材料方面，除保管不善和使用不当的以外，积压浪费的现象也很严重。去年年底，四个主要工地上就积压了价值六百六十四万元的材料。在财务上也是事先无准确计划，用时不控制，事后不审核，钱花了，就算完成任务。这也给铺张浪费开了方便之门。
    最近检查的资料证明，基本建设局直属工程公司一年来由于劳动组织不完善，窝工很多，估计劳动力浪费即达十万元左右。反工修补的浪费也是很大的，从去年四月到十二月返工九十六次，其中由于施工指导错误和施工不良的达一半以上，估计损失
  一万一千多元。
    建设单位的铺张浪费现象也很严重。北京国棉一厂的筹建费，至少可节约二万多元。开工典礼花了七千三百元是过多的；宿舍里的床头柜、碗柜和窗帘布等，有的可以减少，有的可以不要。这个厂原列绿化环境费三万元，已经多了，去年又增为六万元，我们竟没有审查出来，到今年春天止，共花了四万一千多元，其中包括无计划修建的两座喷水池，造价为一万一千多元，花树六十多种，有的贵达五十元一棵，甚至把一七点五斤金鱼，也列入基本建设投资内。北京国棉二厂不适当的开支也很多。如二十个理发员，买了一百零四把推子和发剪，一百二十八把刀子，可以用四十年。其他筹建单位也有类似的情况，如石家庄国棉二厂，自己做的一百六十元一套的沙发嫌不好，又花二千一百元到天津去买五套皮沙发；仪器要买外国的；至于临时建筑的浪费就更多了。
    为什么会产生这些毛病呢？除了因为没有经验和有些单位提供的资料不够确实以外，主要的是基本建设局的领导工作人员以及局领导下的某些工作人员，没有认真地学习党和国家的投资政策，合理和节约地使用国家积累，不仔细计算各种建筑物及设备的利用率，不考虑投资的使用跟促进国家工业化和发展国民经济的关系，盲目地追求高的标准。认为新建的工厂既是社会主义企业，就什么都要大、要多、要新、要好、要全。不仅职工的生活、福利及文化娱乐工作要包下来，就是附属企业，也是越多越好。在这种思想指导之下所建成的新厂，不仅浪费了国家资金，造成生产上的折旧费和维修费高，而且会影响工农联盟，因为工农生活相差过分悬殊了。
    在基本建设投资年年降低，任务年年完成的情况下，有些同志就容易和喜欢欣赏自己的成绩，不能兢兢业业、谦虚谨慎地对待自己的工作，及时发现和纠正自己工作中的缺点和错误，以提高自己的工作，因而去年有些工地质量下降了，设计上质量事故也比一九五三年增加了。跟着骄傲自满情绪而来的是保守思想，看不见新鲜事物，不能认真研究建设过程的各个工作环节中的巨大的节约潜力；更看不见机器和建筑材料价格在逐年下降是节省基本建设投资的重大因素，因而在各项建筑安装造价的计算上，都是趋于保守的。
    基本建设局领导人员有严重的官僚主义作风，对基本建设计划和各种设计文件，没有认真地组织审查，没有及时地检查、总结设计和施工方面的工作，没有及时根据实践的经验，制定一个厂的家具、器具、设备、宿舍、筹建费、训练费等的标准，这不仅使编制和审查计划的同志感到困难，而且，我们也心中无数，盲目听信某些工作人员不正确的意见，助长了他们的铺张浪费思想。
    为了消除基本建设部门的浪费现象，厉行节约，纺织工业部已在去年十二月基本建设会议及今春厂长会议上，指定基本建设的各个部门进行一次群众性的反浪费检查，并以揭发出来的材料，结合中央历次关于节约使用国家积累的指示的精神和赫鲁晓夫同志在全苏建筑会议上的报告，进行一次学习。逐步地制定各项标准和定额，逐一审查每个新建企业的建设项目，认真修改投资计划。事实证明这样做是有效的，如北京国棉三厂的投资计划就比二厂降低百分之十四点零六。设计公司从今年一月开始到四月十二日止，不断地审查和修改已经做好的设计，为国家节约了一百二十四万元。北京国棉二厂行政负责同志在检查浪费之后，在全体职工大会上做了检讨，并积极处理了那些购制过多过好的家具、器具及仪器等，没有建的和没有买的，就不建不买了。工程公司也针对过去的各种浪费情况，研究出一些节约措施，保证在设计预算的基础上，降低造价百分之三点五。因而今年的设计定额就比去年大大改进了一步，厂房造价预算比去年降低了百分之二十五左右。
    纺织工业部还指示基本建设部门要加强和建立甲乙双方的财务、成本及材料管理工作，加强计划管理和技术管理，整编公司机构，严格控制劳动计划，改善劳动组织，减少以至消灭工地的明暗窝工现象。设计部门为了更好地纠正过去设计工作中各种错误和克服浪费，还必须有组织地深入已经建好的工厂，征求群众对于设计的意见，作为今后改进工作的依据。我们相信，在党和上级领导之下，在群众的监督下，是可以逐渐改正工作中的缺点和错误的。
