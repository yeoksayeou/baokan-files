    Collecting Scrap, Utilizing Scrap
    Zhang Chuanqi
    Under the initiative of League member Ma Delin, the machine shop of the Jiamusi Textile Factory's mechanical department established a youth conservation team of one hundred and sixty people. Almost all workers in the workshop participated.
    In mid-April, the youth conservation team's red flag was planted on the scrap iron pile in the scrap warehouse. The youth began to collect scrap metal. In about one and a half hours, they picked out 1,500 kilograms of usable iron plate, 1,500 kilograms of iron material, over 1,000 screws, over 60 kilograms of copper material, and various tools such as files and wrenches.
    Afterward, the youth conservation team carried out twelve more scrap collection activities. They also picked out more than 10,000 kilograms of usable raw iron, more than 2,000 kilograms of iron plate, and more than 1,000 tools from the scrap warehouse's "wood pile," "iron plate pile," "wrought iron pile," and "pig iron pile." The total value was more than 13,700 yuan. The factory's Party committee, administration, trade union, and youth league jointly wrote a congratulatory letter to the youth conservation team.
    The recovery of tens of thousands of kilograms of usable scrap greatly reduced the planned supply of raw materials.
    Workers began to use scrap to produce. This was not an easy task. In the past, workers considered using scrap as "laborious, troublesome, and unrewarding." Now, they all regard using scrap to manufacture high-quality products as a very glorious thing. Young workers Wu Baoheng, Jin Wenshan, Li Yu, etc., used to be unwilling to accept scrap materials when the foreman occasionally assigned them, some left them unused, and some even refused to work. But after joining the youth conservation team, they took the initiative to ask the foreman to use scrap materials. They said, "Using scrap materials, making good products, and saving raw materials is a contribution to the motherland." Li Yu used scrap axles, which not only reduced labor hours but also produced excellent products.
    The machine shop overfulfilled its May plan for using scrap. The utilization of scrap iron accounted for 56 percent; the utilization of scrap iron plate accounted for 30 percent; the utilization of scrap pig iron accounted for 80 percent; and the copper material was entirely made of scrap copper powder. Since April 15th, all the files used in the workshop were those that had been recovered.
    Through collecting and using scrap, workers have become more aware of ensuring quality. They were greatly educated when they saw the defective products they had made in the scrap iron pile. League member Ma Renbo said, "We can't pick it back up on the one hand, and then throw out defective products on the other." Guo Songtao said, "To use scrap materials and not produce defective products, we must improve our skills." Therefore, he took the initiative to learn brazing from the technician. Many young workers had difficulty sharpening knives and finding the right angles when using scrap materials, so the Youth League and the trade union organized everyone to study Tian Baofu's knife-sharpening method and conducted practical demonstrations.
    Because workers paid attention to quality and improved their skills, the machine shop began to use a lot of scrap materials from the second half of April, and the quality was not only not reduced but also improved. Guo Shangqin's group used to produce defective products frequently, but since the second half of April, they have not produced any defective products. The scrap rate of the whole workshop has been decreasing month by month: it was 0.5 percent in March, 0.3 percent in April, and dropped to 0.15 percent in May.
    Driven by the youth conservation team of the machine shop, the workers of the boiler shop of the mechanical department also automatically participated in the voluntary labor of collecting scrap, picking up more than 9,000 kilograms of usable steel pipes and more than 350 various important parts, worth more than 23,000 yuan; in May, their savings from the utilization of scrap materials amounted to more than 5,000 yuan. The workers of the electrical workshop also picked up various electrical materials, worth more than 7,200 yuan.

    收集废料，利用废料
    张传岐
    佳木斯纺织厂机械部的机械车间，在团员马德林的倡议下，成立了一支一百六十人的青年节约队。全车间的职工几乎都参加了进来。
    四月中旬，青年节约队的红旗插到了废品库里的废铁堆上。青年们开始了收集废料废铁的工作。约一小时半的时间，他们挑出了可用铁板一千五百公斤、铁料一千五百公斤、挑出螺丝一千多个，铜料六十多公斤，还有锉刀、扳子等各式各样的工具。
    以后，青年节约队又分别进行了十二次收集废料的活动。他们又从废品库的“木料山”、“铁板山”、“熟铁山”、“生铁山”拣回来一万多公斤可以利用的元铁，两千多公斤铁板，以及一千多件工具。总共价值一万三千七百多元。厂里党、政、工、团联名给青年节约队写了贺信。
    上万公斤能用的废料收回来，大大减少了原材料的计划供应量。
    工人们开始利用废料来生产。这是一件不容易的事。过去，工人们把用废料看成是“费工、费事、不讨好”的事。现在都把利用废料制造质量优良的产品，看成是非常光荣的事了。青年工人吴宝衡、金文善、李玉等，过去碰到工长有时分配点废料时，都不愿要，有的放着不用，有的连活都不干了。可是参加了青年节约队后主动向工长请求使用废料。他们说：“用废料，制好活，节省原材料，就是对祖国的贡献。”李玉用废料车轴不但降低了工时，而且全是优良品。
    机械车间五月份利用废料的计划超额完成了。元铁，利用废料占百分之五十六；铁板，利用废料占百分之三十；生铁，利用废料占百分之八十；铜料，完全是用废铜末子化的。从四月十五日以后，全车间使用的锉刀完全是拣回来的。
    通过收集废料和使用废料，工人们更加重视了保证质量。他们从废铁堆里亲眼看到自己制成的废品，受到很大的教育。团员马仁波说：“我们不能一面往回拣，再一面出废品往外扔啊。”郭松涛说：“用废料，还要不出废品，就得提高技术。”因此，他主动去找技术员学习炶火。很多青年工人在使用废料中磨不好刀，找不准角度，青年团和工会就组织大家学习田宝富磨刀法，并进行了实际表演。
    由于工人们重视了质量，提高了技术，机械车间从四月下半月就开始大量使用废料，质量不但没有降低，而且还提高了。郭尚勤小组过去常出废品，可是在四月下半月以后，一直没有出过废品。全车间的废品率在逐月下降：三月是百分之零点五，四月是百分之零点三，五月就下降到百分之零点一五了。
    在机械车间青年节约队的带动下，机械部锅炉车间的职工也自动参加收集废料的义务劳动，拣回能用的钢管九千多公斤，各种重要机件三百五十多件，价值两万三千多元；五月份，他们利用废料的节约价值就达五千多元。电气车间的工人们也拣回来了各种电工器材，价值七千二百多元。
