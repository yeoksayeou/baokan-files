Sichuan pumping stations play a role in fighting drought
    The fifty-four pumping stations (including forty-eight newly built) distributed in twenty-six counties in Sichuan Province started pumping water successively in May to help farmers fight drought, irrigating more than 62,000 mu of rice paddies. More than 1,000 mu of rice paddies in the irrigation area of the Fujichang pumping station in Luxian County have been fully planted with rice seedlings, which are growing about a foot taller than the surrounding rice seedlings. With the help of the pumping station in Guancang Township, Jintang County, the yield of wheat per mu in the irrigation area increased by 30% compared to the past, and the production of spring crops increased by 80,000 jin of grain. Combining the pumping station construction work in Fanjiatang, Tongnan County, a new agricultural cooperative and three mutual aid groups were established this spring, and 70% of the farmers in the irrigation area were organized.

    四川抽水机站发挥抗旱作用
    分布在四川省二十六县的五十四座抽水机站
  （内新建四十八座），五月间先后开车打水，帮助农民抗旱，使六万两千多亩稻田得到灌溉。泸县福集场抽水机站灌区的一千多亩稻田得到满栽满插的稻秧，长得比周围稻秧高一尺左右。金堂县官仓乡在抽水机站帮助下，灌区每亩麦子产量比从前提高百分之三十，小春作物增产了八万斤粮食。潼南县樊家堂结合抽水机建站工作，今春新建农业社一个，互助联组三个，灌区内百分之七十农户组织起来。
