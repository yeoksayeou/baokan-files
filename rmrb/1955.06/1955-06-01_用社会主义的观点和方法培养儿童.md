    The "June 1st" International Children's Day has arrived. Peace-loving people all over the world place their hopes on the new generation, care about their growth, and work diligently on various fronts for the happiness of the new generation.
    Children in the two worlds live completely different lives. In capitalist countries, the fate of children is tragic. Hundreds of thousands of children in the United States are tried for crimes every year. Deeply poisoned by obscene and thieving television programs, novels, and movies, incidents of children killing people occur from time to time, even including shooting their own parents. In colonies and semi-colonies, the mortality rate of children is alarming. However, in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, children receive affectionate care in all aspects, and their physical and mental development is reliably guaranteed. Schools, children's hospitals, kindergartens, nurseries, and children's sanatoriums are constantly increasing. In 1954, the Soviet Union already had more than 200,000 schools, with 57 million students, an increase of 8 million compared to 1940. In our country, the Party and the government deeply care about the growth of children. With the development of the national construction cause, the Party and the government are not only striving to increase children's care and education institutions, expand children's welfare and cultural facilities, and create better conditions for children; but also constantly educating the broad masses of people to establish correct views and attitudes towards children, and use correct education methods to cultivate a new generation of socialists who are physically strong, brave, honest, love labor, love learning, love the motherland, and are full of collectivist spirit. Those phenomena that abuse and harm children have been severely criticized by public opinion, and some have been punished by law. This shows that the physical and mental health of children in our country has been further guaranteed.
    However, cultivating and educating the new generation is a very arduous task. Many people still retain feudal or bourgeois views on children and methods of educating children. Some people believe that loving children means letting them enjoy as much as possible, labor as little as possible, or even not letting them labor at all, and arranging everything for them properly, eating good food and wearing good clothes; they let children indulge in their desires and give them everything they ask for, without making them suffer any "grievances." They think this is the child's happiness, and this is the parents' responsibility; they do not consider that people who are pampered, do not love labor, only care about themselves, and do not care about others cannot have any happiness. There are also many people who know that they should educate their children, but their only standard for educating children is to make them "obedient." In society, in schools, and even in the Young Pioneers organization, there is such a view: those who are obedient, docile, and well-behaved are considered good children, while those who are lively, active, and unwilling to obey are "bad" children, good children can join the team, and "bad" children cannot join the team. This makes the children's vigorous vitality and lively character subject to interference and suppression everywhere, unable to develop properly, and ultimately turns them into timid, shrinking, and dull "little adults." It is difficult to imagine that children cultivated and educated in this way will have greater initiative and creativity when they grow up and enter life, and therefore they will inevitably limit their greater role in society. There are also some people who regard children as their parents' private property, beat and scold them at will, abuse them, and even cases of cruelly persecuting children have occurred; they forget that when a child is born, he is a citizen of the country and is protected by law. Parents who persecute their children must be punished by law.
    We must resolutely oppose those feudal and bourgeois views and methods of treating and educating children, and treat and educate children with socialist thought. That is to say, in children's lives, studies, and other activities, we must always focus on the needs of society, and cultivate children into useful talents, so that they can play a huge role in the socialist and communist construction cause when they grow up. The socialist construction cause of our country is booming, and we need new people who are full of vigor, proactive, unafraid of difficulties, and have creative spirit. Therefore, paying attention to cultivating children's cheerful, brave, and lively character is a very important task in our cause of cultivating the new generation.
    In order to cultivate children's cheerful, brave, and lively character, we must understand and respect children more. Children have vigorous new energy, and they are naturally active, which is not a bad thing. If we can satisfy their interests and requirements from a positive perspective, develop their talents under leadership, and give play to their initiative and creativity, we can achieve good educational results. Conversely, if we blindly restrict and suppress them, it will inevitably harm the children's vigor and hinder their healthy growth. We hope that schools and the Communist Youth League organizations will pay more attention to and organize children's after-school life, strengthen the work of the Young Pioneers with greater efforts, and help them carry out various meaningful and interesting activities. Such as planting activities, science and technology activities, cultural and artistic activities, sports activities, and appropriate social public welfare activities, etc.
    In the process of children's physical and mental development, they are greatly influenced by society. Only when all aspects of society can consciously educate children, can it be possible to educate children better. Trade union organizations should pay more attention to children's work. Trade union organizations have the responsibility to help employees educate their children and organize reports on how to properly educate children for employees. Trade union clubs and cultural palaces should, according to conditions, set up children's rooms and children's corners, set aside some places as places for children's activities, hold cultural and entertainment evenings or morning meetings specifically for children, organize combat heroes, model workers, scientists, and writers to meet with children, and so on. Trade union libraries should add children's books. Trade union organizations should, according to conditions, hold summer camps and organize the summer life of employees' children. People from all walks of life in society, and members of the Communist Youth League, should give more care, support, and help to children's activities. When children carry out planting activities, agricultural, forestry, and scientific departments should provide children with technical guidance and specific assistance. Writers should participate more in children's various activities, understand their requirements, and create more songs, scripts, novels, poems, paintings, etc. for them to meet their requirements.
    It should also be seen that the filth and poison left over from the old society, such as counter-revolutionaries, bandits, hooligans, and illegal capitalists, are still using various methods to lure and harm children. Therefore, we must also fight against the criminal acts of counter-revolutionaries, bandits, and hooligans who lure and harm children. We must expose their criminal acts and demand that the courts punish them. We must carry out positive education for children to cultivate communist moral qualities; we must organize beneficial activities to attract children to participate in order to get rid of the influence of bad people and bad things. We must educate some children who have been deceived and have thus acquired serious bad habits to help them return to the right path. At the same time, we must also pay attention to the fact that reactionary, obscene, and absurd books and periodicals are also very harmful to children's physical and mental health. They not only affect children's studies, but also affect their health, and the government should be required to ban them. We must guide children to read beneficial books. In this regard, teachers and Young Pioneers instructors have a major responsibility. They should pay attention to using classroom teaching, team meetings, extracurricular activities, etc. to guide children's extracurricular reading, help children increase their knowledge, and cultivate children's communist moral qualities.
    The development of our country's construction cause provides unprecedentedly good conditions for children's growth. Schools, families, and all aspects of society should make good use of these conditions, further establish a new atmosphere of loving and caring for children, and use socialist views and methods to cultivate children into new socialists.

### 用社会主义的观点和方法培养儿童

    用社会主义的观点和方法培养儿童
    “六一”国际儿童节来到了。全世界爱好和平的人类，都把希望寄托在新一代的身上，都关怀着新一代的成长，并且为了新一代的幸福在各个战线上紧张地斗争着，劳动着。
    两个世界的儿童，过着两种完全不同的生活。在资本主义国家，儿童的命运是悲惨的。美国每年有几十万儿童因犯罪受审。由于深受诲淫诲盗的电视节目、小说、电影的毒害，儿童杀人的事件时常发生，甚至有枪杀自己父母的。在殖民地和半殖民地，儿童的死亡率是可惊的。然而在苏联和人民民主国家，儿童受到了各方面的亲切关怀，他们的身心发展有着可靠的保障。学校、儿童医院、幼儿园、托儿所、儿童疗养院不断增加。苏联一九五四年已有二十多万所学校，在校学习的人数达到了五千七百万，比一九四○年增加了八百万。在我国，党和政府深切地关怀着儿童的成长。随着国家建设事业的发展，党和政府一方面努力增设儿童保育和教育机关，扩大儿童的福利和文化设施，给孩子们创造更好的条件；一方面不断地教育广大人民群众，树立正确的对待儿童的观点和态度，运用正确的教育方法，以培养体质健壮、勇敢、诚实、爱劳动、爱学习、爱祖国和富有集体主义精神的社会主义新一代。那些虐待和损害儿童的现象，受到了社会舆论的严正指责，有的受到了法律制裁。这都说明，我国儿童的身心健康已经有了更大的保障。
    然而，培养和教育新的一代，是十分艰巨的事业。许多人还保留着封建的或资产阶级的对待儿童的观点和教育儿童的方法。有些人认为爱护孩子，就是要尽量让孩子多享受些，少劳动些，甚至根本不让孩子劳动，一切都为他安排得妥妥贴贴，吃要吃好的，穿要穿好的；他们让孩子逞性胡为、有求必应，不使孩子受任何一点“委屈”。他们以为这就是孩子的幸福，这也就是父母的责任；他们却没有考虑到娇生惯养、不爱劳动、只顾自己、不管别人的人，是不可能有什么幸福的。还有许多人虽然知道要教育孩子，但是他们教育孩子的唯一标准就是要孩子“顺从听话”。在社会上，在学校里，甚至在少先队组织里，也都有这样一种看法：认为顺从听话、斯文规矩的是好孩子，而活泼好动、不肯听话的就是“坏”孩子，好孩子可以入队，“坏”孩子就不能入队。这就使孩子们蓬勃的朝气，活泼的性格，处处遭受干涉和压抑，得不到正当的发展，终至把他们养成为畏怯退缩、呆头呆脑的“小大人”。这样培养和教育出来的孩子，一旦长大成人，走向生活，是很难设想他们会有更大的主动性和创造性的，因而也必然限制了他们在社会上发挥更大的作用。也有些人把孩子看成父母的私产，随便打骂孩子，虐待孩子，甚至还发生了残酷地迫害儿童的案件；他们忘记了当孩子一出生的时候，他就是国家的公民，就受到法律的保护。迫害孩子的父母一定要受到法律的制裁。
    我们必须坚决反对那些封建的和资产阶级的对待儿童的观点和教育方法，而用社会主义思想对待儿童，教育儿童。这就是说，对孩子的生活、学习以及其他活动，都要处处着眼于社会的需要，把孩子培养成为有用人材，以便他们长大以后能够在社会主义和共产主义建设事业中发挥巨大的作用。我们国家的社会主义建设事业正在蓬勃发展，我们需要朝气蓬勃、积极主动、不怕困难、有创造精神的新人。因此，注意培养儿童开朗、勇敢、活泼的性格，这是我们培养新一代的事业中一个非常重要的任务。
    为了培养孩子开朗、勇敢、活泼的性格，就要更多地了解儿童，尊重儿童。儿童有着旺盛的新生的精力，他们天性好动，这并不是什么坏事情，如果能够从积极方面来满足他们的兴趣和要求，有领导地发展他们的才能，发挥他们的主动性和创造性，就可以得到良好的教育效果。相反的，如果一味地加以限制和压抑，必然会伤害了孩子们的朝气，妨碍他们健全地成长。我们希望学校和青年团组织要更好地关心和组织儿童们的课余生活，以更大的力量来加强少先队的工作，帮助他们开展各种有意义、有趣味的活动。如种植活动、科学技术活动、文艺活动、体育活动和适当的社会公益活动等等。
    儿童在身心发育成长的过程中，受着社会的很大影响。只有社会各方面都能够有意识地教育儿童，才有可能把儿童教育得更好。工会组织应当给儿童工作以更多的注意。工会组织有责任帮助职工教育子女，为职工组织有关正确地教育子女的报告。工会的俱乐部和文化宫都应当根据条件，设立儿童室、儿童角，划出一部分地方作为儿童活动的场所，专门为儿童举办文化娱乐晚会或晨会，组织战斗英雄、劳动模范、科学家、作家和儿童见面，等等。工会图书馆应添设儿童读物。工会组织应当根据条件举办夏令营，组织职工子女的暑期生活。社会各方面的人士、青年团员们对于儿童的活动，都要给予更多的关心、支持和帮助。在儿童开展种植活动的时候，农林和科学部门应给予儿童以技术指导和具体帮助。作家应当更多地参加儿童的各种活动，了解孩子们的要求，为他们创作更多的歌曲、剧本、小说、诗歌、图画，等等，以满足孩子们的要求。
    还应当看到，旧社会遗留下来的污毒，如反革命分子、盗匪、流氓以及不法资本家，还在用各种办法诱骗和残害儿童。因此，我们还必须同反革命分子、盗匪、流氓诱骗和残害儿童的罪恶行为作斗争。要揭露他们的犯罪行为，要求法院予以惩办。要对孩子进行正面教育，培养共产主义的道德品质；要组织有益的活动，吸引孩子们参加，以摆脱坏人坏事的影响。对一些受了欺骗因而沾染了严重不良习惯的孩子，要进行教育，帮助他们回到正路上来。同时还要注意，反动、淫秽、荒诞的书刊对儿童身心的危害也是很大的，它不仅影响孩子们的学业，而且影响孩子们的健康，应当要求政府加以取缔。我们要指导儿童阅读有益的读物。在这方面，教师和少先队的辅导员负有重大的责任。他们应当注意利用课堂教学、队会、课外活动等等的机会，指导儿童的课外阅读，帮助儿童增进知识，并培养儿童的共产主义的道德品质。
    我们国家的建设事业的发展，给孩子们的成长提供了前所未有的良好条件。学校、家庭和社会各个方面，应当很好地利用这些条件，进一步树立爱护和关心儿童的新风气，用社会主义的观点和方法，把孩子们培养成为社会主义的新人。
