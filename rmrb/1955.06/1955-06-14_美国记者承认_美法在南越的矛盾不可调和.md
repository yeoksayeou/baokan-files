Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 12th: United Press reporter Preston Grover, in a dispatch from Saigon on the 10th, admitted that US-French relations in South Vietnam had deteriorated and that there were irreconcilable contradictions.

Grover wrote, "For the sake of Indochina, the French here (Saigon) are so disgusted with the Americans that they rarely speak to them. The French almost never speak to members of the current South Vietnamese government, and they vehemently oppose this government. Conversely, the Americans rarely speak to the French. However, they talk very happily when speaking with the South Vietnamese government headed by Ngo Dinh Diem."

The American reporter pointed out that "this animosity is due to a wide range of different policies." The "all policies" of the United States and France in South Vietnam "are mutually contradictory." The reporter revealed that although the United States and France had tried to coordinate policies at a high level, they did not really instruct such "coordination" efforts to be carried out. Grover believes that "in this atmosphere, the assurances of 'cooperation' between the United States and France announced by US Secretary of State Dulles and French Prime Minister Faure after the end of the Paris conference become meaningless."

    美国记者承认
    美法在南越的矛盾不可调和
    新华社河内十二日电　美联社记者普雷斯顿·格罗弗在十日从西贡发出的消息中，承认美法在南越关系恶化，存在着不可调和的矛盾。
    格罗弗写道，“为了印度支那，这里（西贡）的法国人十分厌恶美国人，以致他们很少同美国人讲话。法国人几乎从不同现在执政的南越政府的人员讲话，他们激烈反对这个政府。反过来，美国人很少同法国人讲话。但是，他们在同以吴庭艳为首的南越政府讲话的时候却谈得很愉快。”
    这个美国记者指出，“这种敌视是由于广泛的不同的政策而产生的。”美国和法国在南越的“所有政策都是相互抵触的”。记者透露，尽管法美两国曾试图在高级水平上来协调政策，但是它们并没有把这种进行“协调”的努力真正指示下去。格罗弗认为，“在这种气氛中，美国国务卿杜勒斯和法国总理富尔在巴黎会议结束之后所宣布的法美两国之间进行‘合作’的保证就变得毫无意义了。”
