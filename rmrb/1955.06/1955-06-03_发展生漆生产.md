    Develop Raw Lacquer Production 　 Guo Zhi
    Raw lacquer is the sap from lacquer trees and has a wide range of uses. Modern industries such as manufacturing vehicles, ships, textile machinery, submarine cables, and construction all require it. It is also a major raw material for making handicrafts. Many places in our country produce lacquer, including Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, with Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Shaanxi provinces producing the most.
    Raw lacquer is also one of China's important export commodities. From 1950 to 1954, the exported raw lacquer could be exchanged for more than 48,000 tons of steel or more than 84,000 tons of fertilizer.
    In recent years, the domestic and international demand for raw lacquer has increased significantly. In addition, the main raw lacquer producing areas suffered disasters and reduced production in 1954, which can no longer meet domestic and international supply. Therefore, all lacquer-producing areas should make full use of hills, field corners, barren mountains, and wild lands to cultivate lacquer trees, without hindering the production of grain and technical crops. In addition, there are many lacquer trees in Henan, Shanxi, Xikang and other places, but none of them have been harvested. It is hoped that the relevant leading departments in these areas will educate farmers to harvest lacquer trees in order to increase raw lacquer production, ensure supply, and increase farmers' income.

    发展生漆生产 　 郭植
    生漆是漆树上的浆汁，用途很广。制造车、船、纺织机械、海底电缆等近代工业和建筑都需要它。它也是制造手工艺品的主要原料。我国产漆的地方很多，有湖北、湖南、四川、贵州、陕西、云南、安徽、江西、浙江、福建等省，其中以湖北、湖南、四川、贵州、陕西等省出产最多。
    生漆也是我国重要出口物资之一，一九五○年至一九五四年出口的生漆约能换回四万八千多吨钢材，或八万四千多吨肥田粉。
    近几年来，国内外对生漆的需要量有显著增加，加以一九五四年生漆主要产地受灾减产，已不能满足国内外的供应。因此，各产漆地区应该在不妨碍粮食和技术作物生产的条件下，充分利用丘陵、田角、荒山、野地培植漆树。另外，河南、山西、西康等地漆树也很多，但都没有采割，希望这些地区的有关领导部门教育农民采割漆树，以增加生漆产量，保证供应，并增加农民收入。
