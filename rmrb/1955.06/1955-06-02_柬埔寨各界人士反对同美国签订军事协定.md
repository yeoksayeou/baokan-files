Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st: News from Phnom Penh says that the Cambodian Royal Government's signing of a military agreement with the United States has aroused widespread opposition from all walks of life in Cambodia.

　　The "Unity Daily" published in Phnom Penh said that the Cambodian people are deeply worried and angry about the US-Cambodian military agreement. The newspaper pointed out that, as the United States has done in South Vietnam and Taiwan, US provision of "military aid" is only to provoke war. Cambodia has no reason to sign a military agreement with the United States. The Cambodian people are determined to implement the Geneva Accords, defend peace, consolidate independence, and realize democracy. The "Unity Daily" demanded that the Royal Government not let the Cambodian army fall into the hands of the US imperialists.

　　The news said that Cambodian Democratic Party members expressed their firm opposition to this military agreement.

    柬埔寨各界人士反对同美国签订军事协定
    新华社河内一日电　金边来的消息说，柬埔寨王国政府同美国签订军事协定以后，引起了柬埔寨各界人士广泛的反对。
    在金边出版的“团结报”说，柬埔寨人民对美柬军事协定感到十分忧虑和愤怒。报纸指出，像美国在南越和台湾所做的那样，美国提供“军事援助”只是为了挑拨战争而已。柬埔寨没有任何理由同美国签订军事协定。柬埔寨人民坚决执行日内瓦协定，保卫和平，巩固独立和实现民主。“团结报”要求王国政府不让柬埔寨的军队落到美帝国主义的手里去。
    消息说，柬埔寨的民主党人士表示坚决反对这个军事协定。
