The readers of the People's Daily hope to see an article introducing a Soviet collective farm, how it was established, what difficulties it overcame in its development path, and what achievements it made.

Let's take the "Stalin" Collective Farm in Ryazan Oblast, an ordinary farm in central Russia, as an example to illustrate these issues. The lives of the peasants in this oblast, or what was called this province before the revolution, were more difficult than those of peasants in other oblasts in the old days. There was a saying about them: "The Ryazan peasant, suffering generation after generation."

Now, we are among the peasants in the village of Batulino, the location of the central office of this collective farm, in this ancient Russian village. When the members of the farm learned that we were preparing to introduce the establishment of this farm to Chinese comrades, many decided to participate in the discussion. The collective farm's office was quickly filled with some older people—the first collectivizers. Sitting close to our table was the farm's first chairman, the elderly member of the farm and current member of the farm's management committee, Alexei Samsonov. Beside him sat the farm's work team leader, Fyodor Kiselev. The old member Ivan Kiselev also came. The discussion continued long past midnight. From their conversation, one could see a vivid picture of the collective farm's initial achievements and twists and turns...

"With the victory of the Soviet regime, the landlords' land was divided," the collective farm members said. "Landless and land-poor peasants received a share of land, and life got better! Those Ryazan peasants who used to wander around to make a living returned home! Now, each of them can cultivate their own piece of land and harvest their own grain, and there is no more threat of the landlords' enslavement."

However, after living as free masters on free land for a period, the peasants deeply felt that they still could not completely escape poverty. The rich peasants were still getting rich by exploiting the poor peasants.

The Communist Party and the Soviet regime pointed out the broad road to a happy and prosperous life for the peasants—collectivized agricultural production. In 1929, a collective farm was established in the village of Batulino. The socialist transformation of agriculture began. Most peasants applied to join the collective farm; however, under the instigation of the rich peasants, some quickly withdrew their applications. However, this did not shake those with firm will among the peasants—the activists who laid the foundation for the collective farm. The first members of the collective farm were seventeen people, and they began to pave the way for a new life.

What kind of people were they?

Alexei Samsonov was the son of a poor peasant, a participant in the civil war. Grigory Mushkin, a Communist Party member, was a former sailor, a fighter for the Soviet regime. Akulina Kacharina was a widow, a mother of four children. Ekaterina Maksimova was the wife of a railway worker who died in the civil war. Alexei Kochetov was a peasant—a middle peasant. And there were Youth League members Dmitry Yermilov, Ivan Gusarov, and Yakov Kiselev. While their parents were still considering, wavering, and had not yet decided to join the collective farm, these Youth League members set an example by becoming members of the collective farm first, and began to work enthusiastically in the farm.

At the general meeting of the farm, the collective farm members elected a three-person farm management committee. Alexei Samsonov was elected as the chairman. A resolution was passed to turn all land, draft animals, farm implements, carts, and operating buildings over to the public. A total of thirty-five hectares of land were combined, along with four horses, ten plows, eleven harrows, and four carts. Due to the insufficient number of draft animals, it was decided to add four more horses. The farm collected enough seeds; because each person who joined the collective farm kept enough seeds for the land they had occupied before joining the farm. More than 25 percent of the total value of the property joining the collective farm was designated as the farm's public accumulation fund, and the rest as the shareholding fund. The public accumulation fund was the sacred and inviolable property of the farm, while the shareholding fund could be returned to the member when he withdrew from the collective farm.

Peasants in some areas had proposed that the poultry, sheep, and pigs belonging to the farm members should also be put together and collectivized. However, in Batulino, people did not follow this suggestion. Whether it was poultry, pigs, or sheep, they were left for the personal use of the collective farm members. At that time, no household raised two dairy cows, so when establishing the collective farm's livestock farm, it was decided to purchase calves from collective farm members and local peasants, and to purchase dairy cows from other places.

In the first year of collective management, the farm achieved a bumper harvest. The farm selected the best grain to keep as seeds, repaid the state's debt, and distributed the rest to the collective farm members. The bumper harvest was the best kind of propaganda for the collective farm. Individual peasants submitted applications to join the collective farm one after another. The collective farm gradually filled up with farm implements, draft animals, and seeds. The collective farm developed, the cultivated area expanded, and the organization of labor was also adjusted.

However, there were also many chaotic phenomena in the collective farm, mainly because there was a lack of experience in managing large collective farms, and they were not good at organizing people to complete all the work of the farm in a timely manner. For example, livestock were kept in unsuitable barns; the feeding work was not done well. Livestock became thin, and some horses and dairy cows died... These setbacks made some farm members waver. They began to talk about withdrawing from the collective farm and taking back their livestock.

Why were the collective farm members so impatient and flustered by the initial difficulties?

In this regard, the collective farm system's mortal enemy—the rich peasants—played a considerable role. There were only a few rich peasants left in the village, but they were doing some dark deeds. It was easier to fight against open enemies, but it was much more difficult to fight against those hidden, lurking enemies who infiltrated the collective farm, those who supported the Soviet regime in meetings but were actually carrying out sabotage and spreading provocative anti-collective farm rumors. It was finally found out that Andrei Kagilin, who used to be a rich peasant, although he had sworn allegiance to the collective farm system when he joined the collective farm, actually tried to undermine the farm. This Kagilin persuaded collective farm members to leave the farm and take away their livestock. After further investigation, weapons were found in his residence... Kagilin and his accomplices were expelled from the farm and received their due punishment.

At that time, the state could not fully meet the needs of the collective farms in terms of funds, fertilizers, machinery, and seeds. Therefore, it was not enough for the collective farm to rely solely on the state's help. The members of the "Stalin" Collective Farm in Batulino village took out their personal savings to lend to the farm to purchase feed. In this way, they overcame the difficulty of insufficient feed supply through joint efforts. The members also decided to raise the necessary funds to start building public barns. The members of the farm management committee, Communist Party members, and Youth League members among the collective farm members only kept the grain, potatoes, and vegetables necessary to support their families, and contributed the rest to the fund for building the farm's public buildings. Other collective farmers followed their example. The collective farm members sold the gathered products in the market, and then used the cash obtained to purchase wood, nails, and slate tiles, and immediately started the construction of public barns.

The collective farm became increasingly consolidated, and the collective farm members began to receive a lot of grain, vegetables, and cash from each work-day. However, at that time, cities and industrial centers were distributing grain according to a quota system, and they could not get a sufficient supply.

The members of the "Stalin" Collective Farm, like all collective farmers, certainly could not sit idly by in the face of this difficulty. Therefore, they consciously left less grain as payment for labor-day compensation, so that in addition to fulfilling the obligation to sell to the state, they could also sell a portion of their stored grain to the state at a fixed price. They concentrated all their efforts on developing the grain economy, selling dozens of tons of grain to the state every year to help solve the domestic grain problem.

In the early years, the calculation of labor was a weak link in the collective farm's work. Almost every day, farm members submitted complaints to the farm management committee. The farmers blamed the collective farm leaders for calculating their day's heavy work as equal to that of the watchmen and coachmen. The milkmaids felt that it was unfair to treat the herdsmen's much easier work as equal to theirs. In reviewing all these applications, the farm management committee became increasingly convinced that the average calculation system of labor (each time a collective farm member went out to work, he would be credited with "one stroke"—one work-day) was unfair, and this system could not stimulate people's material interests in improving labor productivity. The collective farm quickly abandoned this system and established standard work quotas and methods for evaluating work-days.

Initially, there were many ambiguities in the collective farm's treatment of the members' personal operations. Some members began to become excessively obsessed with raising livestock for personal use—one family would raise two dairy cows, several sows, and a large flock of sheep. People spent a lot of time taking care of their family's livestock, so that they did not have time to work for the public economy, which put the collective farm at risk of disintegration. However, with the passage of the Agricultural Labor Cooperative Charter in 1935, all this was properly arranged. According to the charter, each collective farm household (under the conditions of the non-black soil zone where Ryazan Oblast is located) could have one dairy cow, no more than two calves, one sow, no more than ten sheep and goats, etc. for personal use. Years of experience have proven that only the public economy is the main source of income for collective farm members, and personal operations can only play a secondary, auxiliary role.

Years of experience have also proven how important it is to properly coordinate the various departments within the public economy. In this regard, the "Stalin" Collective Farm has made many mistakes. For a period of time, this farm neglected the grain economy due to its obsession with vegetable cultivation, completely failed to plant valuable crops such as corn, and did not correctly determine the proportional relationship between animal husbandry and farming.

Now all these shortcomings, like many other shortcomings, have been basically eliminated. The "Stalin" Collective Farm in Ryazan Oblast has become a multi-departmental farm with a large number of products. On this farm, a total of 2,472 hectares of grain and vegetable crops are planted, more than 500 cattle and some pigs are raised; it has a poultry farm raising about 2,000 poultry, a bee farm with about 100 beehives, and a large hotbed cultivation farm, and so on. The average annual milk yield per dairy cow has been increased to 3,000 liters. Several of the best field work teams harvested more than 25 quintals of grain crops per hectare; more than 30 collective farm members have won various Soviet medals and awards for making wheat abundant. The collective farm harvests more than 400 quintals of cabbage per hectare every year. The farm's annual income has exceeded three million rubles.

The economic situation of this collective farm can also be seen from the following figures. In the recent five to seven years, the farm has built three well-equipped cow sheds that can accommodate 280 cattle; these cow sheds are equipped with automatic waterers, overhead tracks (equipment for transporting feed—editor), and electric lights. The farm has also built a new, solid calf shed that can accommodate 120 calves, ten vegetable storage cellars, a garage that can accommodate ten cars, and a poultry house.

All these achievements would have been unimaginable if the Soviet state had not supplied the collective farm with agricultural machinery and equipment. Now, the machine tractor station helps this collective farm cultivate the land and harvest the crops with machines. The experts at the machine tractor station are helping this collective farm improve its cultivation level every day. The role played by the machine tractor station in the years when this collective farm had just consolidated its economy and had just gained a foothold cannot be underestimated.

Then, how are the members of this collective farm—that is, those original peasants—doing?

In this regard, it is enough to cite the following figures. In the past decade, out of 450 collective farm households, 327 have built new houses. Most of these houses are brick-built, spacious, and well-equipped houses. Every house has beautiful furniture. Every family has electric lights and radios. The members of this collective farm live a happy, prosperous, and civilized life...

This is what the members of this collective farm told us about their lives. Finally, they asked us to convey the warmest greetings to our Chinese friends.

    苏联“斯大林”集体农庄是怎样建立起来的
    苏联甫·柯尔尼洛夫
    人民日报的读者希望在报上看到介绍苏联一个集体农庄的文章，介绍它是怎样建立的，它在自己发展道路上克服过什么困难，它取得了哪些成绩。
    拿俄罗斯中部一个普通的农庄——梁赞州的“斯大林”集体农庄为例，说明这些问题。这个州，或者如革命前所称的这个省的农民的生活，在旧时代比其他州的农民还要困苦。关于他们，曾有这样的谚语：“梁赞的庄稼汉，世世代代受熬煎。”
    现在，我们是在这个集体农庄中央办事处的所在地，在古老的俄罗斯的村庄巴土里诺村的农民们中间。当农庄的庄员知道我们准备向中国同志介绍这个农庄的建立经过以后，许多人都决定参加座谈会。集体农庄的办公室里很快就挤满一些上了年纪的人——第一批集体化工作者。靠近我们的桌子坐着农庄的第一任主席，现任农庄管理委员会委员年长的庄员阿历克赛·萨姆索诺夫，同他并排坐着的是农庄工作队队长费道尔·基谢列夫。老庄员伊凡·基谢列夫也来了。座谈会一直继续到午夜以后很久。从他们的谈话中，可以看到关于集体农庄最初的成就和曲折的生动图画……
    “随着苏维埃政权的胜利，地主的土地被分了，”集体农庄庄员们说，“以前少地和无地的农民都获得了一份地，生活好起来了！那些以前为谋生而到处流浪的梁赞州的庄稼人又回家了！现在，他们每个人都已能够耕自己的一份地、打自己的粮食，再也没有地主的奴役来威胁他们了。”
    但是在自由的土地上以自由的主人的身份生活过一段时期以后，农民们深切地感到，他们还是不能完全摆脱贫困。富农还在依靠剥削贫苦的农民而发财致富。
    共产党和苏维埃政权向农民指出了走向幸福和富裕生活的康庄大道——集体经营农业生产。一九二九年在巴土里诺村建立了一个集体农庄。农业的社会主义改造开始了。大多数农民都申请参加集体农庄；但是在富农的煽动下，一些人很快又撤回了自己的申请书。然而这并没有能动摇农民中意志坚定的那些人——为集体农庄奠定基础的积极分子们。集体农庄的第一批庄员共十七个人，他们开始为新生活开辟道路。
    他们是些什么样的人呢？
    阿历克赛·萨姆索诺夫是一个贫农的儿子，国内战争的参加者。共产党员格里高里·穆什金以前是水手，为苏维埃政权而战斗的战士。阿库林娜·卡查林娜是寡妇，四个孩子的母亲。叶卡吉林娜·马克西莫娃是一个在国内战争中牺牲了的铁路工人的妻子。阿历克赛·科契托夫是农民——中农。还有青年团员德米特里·叶尔米洛夫、伊凡·古萨罗夫、雅可夫·基谢列夫，当他们的父母还在考虑、动摇，还没有决定参加集体农庄时，这些青年团员们却先作出了榜样，成了集体农庄的一员，并开始在农庄里热情地工作起来了。
    在农庄的全体大会上，集体农庄庄员们选出了一个由三人组成的农庄管理委员会。阿历克赛·萨姆索诺夫被推选为主席。通过了把土地、耕畜、农具、大车和经营用的建筑物一律归公的决议。一共联合了三十五公顷土地并凑了四匹马，十部犁、十一只耙和四辆大车。由于耕畜过少，决定再添置四匹马。农庄收集了足够的种籽；因为参加集体农庄的每一个人，对于他加入农庄以前所占用的那块土地，都留有足够用的种籽。加入集体农庄的财产总值的百分之二十五以上被提作农庄的公积金，其余的作为股份基金。公积金是农庄神圣不可侵犯的财产，而股份基金则可以在庄员退出集体农庄时发还他。
    有些地区的农民曾提议把属于农庄庄员的家禽、绵羊和猪等等也归在一起化为公有。但是，在巴土里诺，人们没有照这个意见做。无论是家禽、猪或绵羊都留给集体农庄庄员个人使用。当时没有哪一户养有两头乳牛，因此在建立集体农庄的饲畜场时，决定从集体农庄庄员和当地农民那里购买牛犊并从别的地方购买乳牛。
    在实行集体经营的第一年，农庄就获得了丰收。农庄选出了最好的谷物留作种籽，偿还了国家的欠款，其余的就分配给集体农庄庄员了。丰收是集体农庄的最好的一种鼓动工作。个体农民一个接一个地递来要求加入集体农庄的申请书。集体农庄内农具、耕畜、种籽逐渐充实起来。集体农庄发展了，耕地面积扩大了，劳动组织也调整了。
    但是在集体农庄里也发生过不少的混乱现象，这主要是因为在管理大的集体农庄方面还缺乏经验，还不善于组织人们及时完成农庄所有的工作。例如，牲畜被养在不适宜的畜舍里；饲料工作也没做好。牲畜养瘦了，还死了一些马、乳牛……这些挫折使一部分农庄庄员动摇了。他们开始谈到要退出集体农庄，并收回自己的牲畜。
    为什么最初的困难就能使集体农庄的庄员们沉不住气，使他们慌张起来呢？
    在这方面，集体农庄制度的死对头——富农，起了相当大的作用。村子里留下来的富农总共不过几个人，但是他们却在干些黑暗的勾当。同公开的敌人作斗争要容易些，而同那些隐伏起来的、潜入集体农庄的敌人，同那些在大会上拥护苏维埃政权而事实上却在进行破坏活动，散布挑拨性的反集体农庄的谣言的敌人作斗争，就要困难多了。这次终于查明，那个以前是富农的安德烈·卡吉林，虽然他在加入集体农庄时曾宣誓忠于集体农庄制度，但实际上却想竭力搞垮农庄。这个卡吉林劝诱集体农庄庄员们脱离农庄并牵走他们的牲畜。经过进一步的查究，在它的住所里发现了武器……卡吉林及其同伙们被逐出了农庄，并受到了应得的惩罚。
    当时国家还不能充分满足各集体农庄在资金、肥料、机器和种籽方面的需要。因此，集体农庄光指望国家的帮助是不行的。巴土里诺村“斯大林”集体农庄的庄员们把自己的个人积蓄拿出来借给农庄购买饲料。这样就在共同努力下摆脱了饲料供应不足的困境。庄员们还决定筹集必要的资金，来着手建立公共畜舍。农庄管理委员会的委员、集体农庄庄员中的共产党员和青年团员们自己仅留下了为赡养家庭所必需的谷物、马铃薯和蔬菜，其余的都投作了建筑农庄公共建筑物的基金。其他的集体农民们也学习他们的榜样。集体农庄庄员们在市场上卖掉凑集起来的产品，然后以所获得的现金购买木料、钉子和石板瓦，立即开始了公共畜舍的建筑。
      集体农庄日益巩固起来，集体农庄庄员开始从每个劳动日获得了很多谷物、蔬菜和现金。但是，当时城市和工业中心在谷物方面是按照限额配给制发售的，还得不到充分的供应。
      “斯大林”集体农庄的庄员，正像所有的集体农民一样，当然不能坐视这种困难不管。因此，他们自觉地少留下一些谷物作为支付劳动日报酬之用，以便除完成对国家的义务交售外，还能按照规定价格把自己所储存的谷物的一部分出售给国家。他们曾集中全力来发展谷物经济，每年把数十吨谷物售给国家，以帮助解决国内的谷物问题。
    在最初几年，劳动的计算是集体农庄工作中的一个薄弱环节。几乎每天都有农庄庄员向农庄管理委员会提出申诉。种田的人责备集体农庄的领导者把他们一天的沉重工作算得和守望者、驭手的工作相等。挤奶女工认为把牧人的远为轻松的劳动和她们的劳动同等看待是不公平的。农庄管理委员会在审查所有这些申请书时，愈益相信劳动的平均计算制度（一个集体农庄庄员每出去工作一次就给记上“一笔”——一个劳动日）是不公平的，这种制度不能激发人们从物质利益上来关心劳动生产率的提高。集体农庄很快就废弃了这种制度，确定了标准工作定额和劳动日的评定办法。
    最初，集体农庄在对待庄员的个人经营方面曾有很多不明确的地方。某些庄员开始过度醉心于饲育供个人使用的牲畜——一家就养两头乳牛、好几口母猪和大群的绵羊。人们为照顾家里的牲畜费去很多时间，以致没有工夫为公有经济工作，这就使集体农庄面临瓦解的危险。但是，随着一九三五年农业劳动组合章程的通过，这一切都得到了适当的安排。根据章程，集体农庄每一家农户（在梁赞州所在的非黑土带的条件下）可以有乳牛一头、小牛不超过两头、母猪一只，绵羊和山羊不超过十只等等供个人使用。多年的经验证明，只有公有经济才是集体农庄庄员收入的主要源泉，而个人经营只能起次要的、辅助的作用。
    多年的经验也证明，公有经济内各部门之间的正确配合，是多么重要。在这方面，“斯大林”集体农庄犯过不少错误。有一个时期，这个农庄因醉心于种菜业而使谷物经济受到损失，完全没有去种植像玉蜀黍这样的珍贵作物，也没有正确地确定畜牧业和农作业之间的比例关系。
      现在所有这些缺点，正和其他许多别的缺点一样，已经基本上消除了。梁赞州的“斯大林”集体农庄已变成一个多部门的有大量产品的农庄。在这个农庄里共种植了二千四百七十二公顷的谷物和蔬菜作物，饲养了五百多头牛和一些猪；它有一个养着约二千只家禽的养禽场，一个有着约一百只蜂房的养蜂场，并有一个大的温床栽培场以及其他等等。每头乳牛每年的平均挤奶量已提高到三千公升。几个最好的田间工作队从每公顷收获了二十五公担多的谷类作物；三十多个集体农庄庄员由于使小麦丰产而获得苏联的各种勋章和奖章。集体农庄年年从每公顷土地上收获四百多公担的白菜。农庄每年的收入已超过三百万卢布。
    从下列数字中也可以看出这个集体农庄的经济情况。在最近的五年到七年中，农庄共建筑了三所可容二百八十头牛的设备完善的牛舍；在这些牛舍里装设了自动饮水器、架空道（运输饲料的设备——编者），并安装了电灯。农庄还新盖了一所坚固的、可容一百二十头牛犊的小牛舍，十个蔬菜贮藏库，一所可容十部汽车的车库和一个禽舍。
    如果苏维埃国家不供应集体农庄以农业机器设备，所有这些成绩将会是不可思议的。现在，机器拖拉机站以机器帮助这个集体农庄耕种田地并收获庄稼。机器拖拉机站的专家们天天都在帮助这个集体农庄来提高耕作水平。在这个集体农庄刚刚巩固了自己的经济，刚刚站稳脚步的年代里，机器拖拉机站所起的作用是无法估量的。
    那末，这个集体农庄的庄员们——也就是原来的那些农民，过得又怎样呢？
    在这方面，只要举出下面的数字就可以说明了。近十年来，在四百五十家集体农户中，就有三百二十七家盖了新房子。这些房子大多数都是砖造的、宽敞的、设备完善的房屋。每所房子里都有漂亮的家具。家家都有电灯和收音机。这个集体农庄的庄员们过着幸福、富裕和文明的生活……
    这就是这个集体农庄的庄员们向我们谈的关于他们生活的情况。最后，他们要求我们向中国朋友转达最热情的问候。
