    Subjectivism in Actual Work is a Manifestation of Idealism
    Wang Zhemin
    In order to draw a clear line between idealism and materialism in the thinking of cadres, we must first criticize subjectivism, because subjectivism in actual work is a manifestation of idealism. Subjectivism in actual work often does not have a "complete" so-called theoretical system like idealistic philosophy. However, despite this, subjectivism is always the ideological source of "leftist" or rightist errors in all work, and it is fundamentally opposed to dialectical materialism. Subjectivism, in its ideological essence, is an idealistic thing, characterized by the separation of the subjective and the objective, and the separation of knowledge and practice.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Dogmatism and empiricism are both subjectivism, arising from different extremes." Dogmatism absolutizes rational knowledge, believing that only rational knowledge is reliable and that perceptual knowledge is unreliable, and that rational knowledge cannot be derived from perceptual knowledge. This understanding, manifested in work, means not proceeding from reality, not proceeding from objective conditions, but from books, that is, simply quoting some phrases out of context from Marxist books and using them as the basis for formulating work guidelines, plans, and steps. The result is inevitably the separation of the subjective (work guidelines, plans, and steps) from the objective (problems existing in the work), forcing the objective to obey the subjective. In essence, this is an admission of the fundamental principle of idealism that thinking is primary and existence is secondary. This characteristic of dogmatism repeats the errors of idealistic rationalism. Although dogmatists do not have a set of mysterious "theoretical" formulas like idealistic rationalism, nor have they advocated that reason is some "world reason" or "absolute spirit" existing independently of the human brain, nor have they absolutized reason to become a disguised God in essence; both absolutize rational knowledge and deny the reliability and truthfulness of perceptual knowledge. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out in "On Practice": "If one thinks that rational knowledge can be obtained without perceptual knowledge, he is an idealist."
    Empiricists in actual work absolutize perceptual knowledge, believing that only perceptual knowledge is reliable and that rational knowledge is unreliable, and that perceptual knowledge does not need to be elevated to rational knowledge. Therefore, in their work, they only proceed from experience, absolutize the experience gained at one time and in one place, and apply it everywhere regardless of objective conditions, forcing objective things to obey subjective things. Here, in essence, they also admit the fundamental principle of idealism that thinking is primary and existence is secondary. This characteristic of empiricism in actual work repeats the errors of philosophical idealistic empiricism. Although empiricists do not have a set of mysterious "theoretical" formulas like idealistic empiricism, nor do they think that there is nothing in the world except people's sensory experience, nor have they advocated that the objective world is merely a "compound of sensations" or "material of sensory experience," and their source of experience is not considered to be "introspective experience" like idealistic empiricism; but because they absolutize the experience that originally came from actual life and regard it as something that can determine everything, they both embark on a common path in the question of how to treat experience and use experience—regarding experience as primary and objective existence as secondary.
    Some comrades believe that it cannot be said that subjectivism is essentially idealism, because "these comrades acknowledge objective existence and acknowledge that objective things have laws." However, first, the main thing in distinguishing between idealism and materialism in the thinking of our cadres is not to see what they acknowledge verbally, but to see what they actually do. Subjectivists certainly have not advocated verbally that thinking is primary and existence is secondary, and they may even oppose idealism verbally, but because they have made mistakes in epistemology, they unconsciously use the principles of idealism—thinking is primary and existence is secondary—in their actual work. In essence, this is not acknowledging objective existence, but denying objective existence. Second, what kind of laws of objective things do empiricists and pragmatists acknowledge? They only stay at the stage of perceptual knowledge, circling around the superficial phenomena of things, so how can it be said that they acknowledge the laws of objective things?
    Subjectivism manifests itself in various ways in actual work. Conservative thinking and the tendency of blind adventurism are both manifestations of subjectivism.
    In recent years, many work departments have made some errors of conservative thinking to a greater or lesser extent. For example, there is such a situation in the industrial production sector. When the East China Iron and Steel Company formulated its production plan for 1955, it encountered a kind of conservative thinking in some factories, that is, emphasizing difficulties such as old equipment, low efficiency, and many accidents, and finding various reasons to prove that new production targets could not be accepted. Only after repeated and careful calculations, and in-depth actual measurements in the workshops, and through methods such as detailed accounting and tapping potential, was a plan formulated that conformed to the development of production. From this example alone, it can be seen that comrades with conservative thinking are simply because they did not understand the various aspects of the contradictions of things from the perspective of dialectical materialism. In their work, they only saw the difficult factors or the existing achievements, and did not see the favorable factors and potential abilities. Therefore, the plans they formulated were inevitably lagging behind real life and could not keep up with the development of real life. Subjective plans are not in line with objective requirements, which is obviously a mistake of subjectivism and idealism.
    The tendency of blind adventurism has been relatively prevalent in industrial construction and in the movement of mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production in recent years. For example, in the work of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, some comrades overestimated the enthusiasm of the peasants, believing that "today, under the general trend, the peasants can come without being called," and that "today's difficulty is not that the peasants are not conscious enough, but that the leading organs are tying their hands and feet." Therefore, they disregarded objective reality and blindly pursued quantity, size, and speed. In some places, a leading staff member inspected sixteen cooperatives in one night; in one county, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives increased from one percent of the total number of peasant households to seventy percent in one day, and the establishment of several large cooperatives in each district was limited. As a result, most of the cooperatives established in this way were not consolidated, and also harmed the enthusiasm of the peasant masses. Why is this? It is because these comrades only saw the favorable conditions or only emphasized the tasks and progress, and did not see the difficult conditions or the actual steps to achieve these tasks and reach this progress. Specifically, it is that they only saw the enthusiastic side of the peasant masses, but did not see that the agricultural cooperation movement is a complex and arduous task of changing the existing private ownership of the means of production in agriculture and establishing a new type of socialist production relations. Although they ran ahead of real life, they, like comrades with conservative thinking, were divorced from real life and similarly separated the subjective from the objective, and thus made the mistake of subjectivism and idealism.
    Secondly, there are also some comrades in actual work who make the mistake of laissez-faireism. They simplify complex things, wipe out unfavorable factors in the work, exaggerate all favorable factors, and believe that after a round or two of efforts, things will naturally develop smoothly in the desired favorable direction. As a result, things go contrary to their wishes, and the subjective cannot conform to the objective, which is undoubtedly also a mistake of subjectivism and idealism.
    One manifestation of subjectivism in organizational relations is sectarianism. Sectarianism within the Party manifests itself in making independence, seeking status, showing off, attracting some people, excluding some people, flattering, and pulling strings, etc. All these styles are dishonest, not scientific ways of doing things, and do not conform to the actual needs of the revolution. Such people consider problems from the perspective of individuals and small groups, and from the perspective of subjective plans. Therefore, all sectarian ideas are subjectivist.
    Formalism is also a manifestation of subjectivism, because comrades with this kind of thinking only see the superficial phenomena of things and do not delve into the essence of things. Therefore, in their work, they pursue quantity but not quality, emphasize quantity but not quality, and emphasize form but not content. This superficiality is also subjectivity. They are also making the mistake of subjectivism and idealism.
    Overall, all of the above tells us that many comrades who make mistakes in actual work, although their forms of error are different, their errors all have this characteristic, that is, separating the subjective from the objective, separating knowledge from practice, only grasping a certain part of the situation in the work, a certain aspect of the conditions, a certain link, a certain characteristic, unilaterally exaggerating it, and using it as the basis for action, and the result is inevitably falling into the quagmire of subjectivism and idealism.
    How can we make our subjective conform to the objective? The key lies in understanding the Marxist dialectical materialist world view, especially in grasping the dialectical materialist epistemology and using the principles of dialectical materialism to correctly understand objective phenomena.
    Dialectical materialist epistemology is based on the theory of reflection. It tells us a most basic truth: ideas are reflections of matter, and thinking is a reflection of existence.
    What is correct thinking, what is wrong thinking, what is right, and what is wrong, the only standard is to see whether it reflects the actual situation of the objective external world. Truth is the correct reflection of the laws of the objective external world.
    The reason why we can achieve success in our work is that, in terms of ideological methods, our work guidelines, plans, and steps correctly reflect the actual situation of the objective reality. Conversely, if we do something wrong, it is because we have not reflected the actual situation of the objective reality. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in "On Practice": "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the expected results, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice."
    There is more than one reason for making mistakes of subjectivism, but the most common is the issue of stand. Anyone who looks at problems from the stand of non-working class will certainly not be able to objectively and truthfully reflect the external world. Individualists put personal interests first, and from this stand, they are bound to be opposed to the collective, opposed to the masses, and opposed to objective laws, and they are bound to fall into subjectivism. Therefore, correct viewpoints and methods are inseparable from correct stands. In addition, not studying theory, not understanding dialectical materialism, and not understanding scientific ideological methods and working methods are also reasons for causing subjectivism.
    As long as we understand the dialectical materialist world view, grasp the correct ideological methods, and proceed from the needs of the revolution and the needs of the Chinese people in everything, we will often require our thinking to conform to the situation of the objective external world as much as possible, and often pay attention to examining our thinking in actual life. Once we find that it is wrong, we will humbly correct it, and over time, we will gradually improve our cognitive ability (reflection ability), so we will not make or make fewer mistakes of subjectivism.

    实际工作中的主观主义是唯心主义的表现
    王哲民
    为了在干部思想上划清唯心主义和唯物主义的界线，首先就必须批判主观主义，因为实际工作中的主观主义就是唯心主义的表现。实际工作中的主观主义往往并不像唯心主义哲学那样有一“整套”所谓理论系统。但是，尽管如此，主观主义始终都是一切工作中犯“左”倾或右倾错误的思想根源，它同辩证唯物主义是根本对立的。主观主义按其思想实质来说是唯心主义的东西，是以主观和客观相分裂、以认识和实践相分裂为特征的。
    毛泽东同志指出：“教条主义、经验主义，两者都是主观主义，是从不同的两极发生的东西。”教条主义是把理性认识绝对化，认为只有理性认识是可靠的，感性认识是靠不住的，认为理性认识可以不从感性认识得来。这种认识，表现在工作上就是不从实际出发，不从客观情况出发，而是从书本出发，即简单地从马克思主义的书本中断章取义地摘引一些词句，并以此作为制定工作方针、计划和步骤的根据。其结果必然是主观（工作方针、计划和步骤）和客观（工作中存在的问题）相分裂，强使客观服从主观。实质上这是承认了思惟是第一性的、存在是第二性的唯心主义的根本原理。教条主义的这种特点是重复了唯心主义唯理论的错误的。虽然教条主义者没有唯心主义唯理论那样一套玄妙的“理论”公式，也没有主张过理性是脱离人的头脑而独立存在的什么“世界理性”或“绝对精神”，同时也没有把理性绝对化，成为实质上是变相的上帝；但是两者都是把理性认识绝对化，否认感性认识的可靠性和真实性。毛泽东同志在“实践论”中明确地指出：“如果以为理性认识可以不从感性认识得来，他就是一个唯心论者。”
    实际工作中的经验主义者则是把感性认识绝对化，认为只有感性认识是可靠的，理性认识是靠不住的，认为感性认识不必上升为理性认识，因此他们在工作中就只是从经验出发，把一时一地取得的经验绝对化，不问客观情况，到处乱套，强使客观的东西服从主观的东西。在这里他们实质上也是承认了思惟是第一性的、存在是第二性的唯心主义根本原理。实际工作中的经验主义的这个特点是重复了哲学唯心主义经验论的错误的。虽然经验主义者没有唯心主义经验论那一套玄妙的“理论”公式，也没有认为世界上除了人们的感觉经验之外什么也没有，也没有主张过客观世界只不过是人们“感觉的复合”或“感觉经验的材料”，同时他们的经验的来源也不是像唯心主义经验论那样认为是“内省的经验”；但是由于他们把本来是来自实际生活中的经验绝对化起来，并把它当成是可以决定一切的东西，因此就在如何对待经验、运用经验的问题上，它们两者走上了共同的道路——把经验看成是第一性的，把客观存在的事物看成是第二性的。
    有的同志认为，不能说主观主义实质上就是唯心主义的，理由是“这些同志是承认客观存在的，承认客观事物是有规律性的”。但是，第一，划分我们干部思想上的唯心主义和唯物主义，主要的不是看他们口头上承认什么，而是看他们实际上怎样做的。主观主义者当然在口头上没有主张过思惟是第一性的，存在是第二性的，甚至于他们还会在口头上反对唯心主义，但是由于他们在认识论上犯了错误，所以在实际工作中就不自觉地用了唯心主义的原理——思惟是第一性的，存在是第二性的。实质上这不是承认了客观存在，而是否认了客观存在。第二，对于经验主义者和事务主义者来说，他们承认什么客观事物的规律性呢？他们只是停留在感性认识阶段，在事物表面现象上打圈子，这样怎么能说他们承认客观事物的规律性呢？
    主观主义在实际工作中的表现是多种多样的。保守思想和盲目冒进的倾向都是主观主义的表现。
    几年来许多工作部门或多或少都犯了一些保守思想的错误。譬如在工业生产部门中就有这种情形。华东钢铁公司在制定一九五五年生产计划时，在有些厂里曾遇到一种保守思想，即强调设备旧、效力低、事故多等困难，并找出各种理由证实不能接受新的生产指标。只是经过了反复和仔细的核算，并深入车间进行实际的测定，更通过算细帐、挖潜力等办法才制定出来符合于生产发展的计划。仅从这个例子就可以看出，有保守思想的同志就是因为没有以辩证唯物主义的观点认识事物矛盾的各个方面，他们在工作中只看到困难的因素或既有的成绩这一面，没看到有利的因素和潜在的能力一面，因此他们所制定出来的计划必然是落后于现实生活的，赶不上现实生活的发展。主观的计划和客观的要求不相符合，这显然是犯了主观主义、唯心主义的错误。
    盲目冒进的倾向，几年来在工业建设当中和农业生产互助合作运动当中，曾较为普遍地存在过。譬如在发展农业生产合作社的工作中，有些同志过高地估计了农民的积极性，认为“今天农民在大势所趋之下，可以不叫自到”，“今天的困难不是农民觉悟不高，而是领导机关的束手束脚”，因此就不顾客观实际情况，盲目地贪多贪大贪快，有些地方一个领导工作人员一夜之间检查了十六个社；一个县一日之间入社的农户从总农户的百分之一发展到百分之七十，并且限定每区办几个大社。结果，这样办起来的社大部分没有得到巩固，而且还伤害了农民群众的积极性。为什么会这样呢？就是因为这些同志只看到了有利的条件或只强调了任务和进度，没有看到困难的条件或实现这些任务和达到这些进度的实际步骤。具体地说，就是只看到了农民群众的积极性一面，而没有看到农业合作化运动是改变农业中现存的私有制的生产关系、建立新型的社会主义生产关系这个复杂的艰苦的任务。他们虽然是跑到了现实生活的前面，但他们和有保守思想的同志一样是脱离了实际生活，同样地把主观和客观割裂开来，因而也就犯了主观主义、唯心主义的错误。
    其次，在实际工作中也还有些同志犯自流主义的错误。他们把复杂的事情简单化，把工作中不利的因素抹掉，把一切有利因素夸大，自以为经过一两阵努力，事情就会自然而然地向着希望的有利方向顺畅发展。结果是事与愿违，主观不能符合客观，这无疑也是犯了主观主义、唯心主义的错误。
    主观主义在组织关系上的一种表现，就是宗派主义。党内的宗派主义表现在闹独立性，闹地位，闹出风头，拉拢一些人，排挤一些人，吹吹拍拍，拉拉扯扯等等。所有这一切作风，都是不老实的，都不是科学的办事态度，都是和革命的实际需要不符合的。这种人考虑问题是从个人和小集团出发，从主观打算出发。因此一切宗派主义思想都是主观主义的。
    形式主义也是一种主观主义的表现，因为有这种思想的同志只看到事物表面现象，没有深入事物的本质，所以在工作中就求多不求好，重量不重质，重形式不重内容。这种表面性也就是主观性。他们同样是犯了主观主义、唯心主义的错误。
    总的看来，以上这些告诉我们，许多在实际工作中犯错误的同志，他们的错误的表现形式虽有种种不同，他们的错误都具有这样一个特征，就是把主观和客观相分离，把认识和实践相分离，只抓住了工作中的某一部分情况、某一方面的条件、某一个环节、某一个特点，片面地把它加以夸大，并以此作为行动的根据，结果就必然陷入主观主义、唯心主义的泥坑。
    怎样才能使我们的主观和客观相一致呢？关键的问题就在于领会马克思主义辩证唯物主义的世界观，特别是要掌握辩证唯物主义的认识论，运用辩证唯物主义的原理来正确地认识客观现象。
    辩证唯物主义的认识论以反映论为基础。它告诉我们一个最基本的道理：观念是物质的反映，思惟是存在的反映。
    什么是正确的思想，什么是错误的思想，什么是是，什么是非，唯一的标准就看它是否反映了客观外界的实在情况。真理就是对客观外界规律性的正确反映。
    我们做工作所以能够取得成绩，在思想方法上，就是因为我们的工作方针、计划和步骤正确地反映了客观实在的情况。反之，做错了，就是因为没有反映客观实在的情况。毛泽东同志在“实践论”中写道：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。”
    犯主观主义的错误的原因不止一个，但最普遍的是立场问题。凡是站在非工人阶级的立场去看问题，就一定不能客观地如实地反映外界。个人主义者把个人利益放在第一位，从这个立场出发，就势必同集体对立，同群众对立，同客观规律对立，就势必要陷入主观主义。所以，正确的观点和方法是同正确的立场分不开的。此外，没有学习理论，不懂得辩证唯物主义，不懂得科学的思想方法和工作方法，也是造成主观主义的原因。
    只要我们领会了辩证唯物主义的世界观，掌握正确的思想方法，一切都从革命的需要和中国人民的需要出发，我们就会经常要求我们的思想尽可能地符合客观外界的情况，经常注意在实际生活中检验我们的思想，一发现它不对，就虚心地纠正，长此以往就会逐渐地提高我们的认识能力（反映能力），因此就会不犯或少犯主观主义的错误。
