    The main structure of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge is completed ahead of schedule
    The main structure of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge, the first Yellow River bridge built by the Chinese people, was completed on June 1st, 14 days ahead of schedule. Now all the piers and abutments of the bridge are exposed above the river surface. Workers are stepping up the construction of the railway lines at both ends of the bridge. The steel beams for the bridge are being transported to the construction site one after another. The bridge can be erected and open to traffic before the Yellow River flood arrives.
    The construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge officially started on April 1, 1954. During the construction process, the staff actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and carried out creative labor. They bravely overcame difficulties such as floods, ice floes, and severe cold, and finally completed the task ahead of schedule while ensuring quality.
    The people of the whole country have provided support in all aspects for the construction of this bridge. Shipbuilders and divers from Hankou, Jinzhou and other places provided assistance during the construction preparation period and the tense stage of the project. Many factories across the country have supplied various materials for the bridge. Local farmers provided more than 20,000 workdays for the bridge construction site for material preparation, house building and other work. (Reported by our reporter stationed in Lanzhou)
    The first modern train power plant generates electricity
    China's first modern train power plant started supplying electricity in Jiamusi on June 1. At 10:30 am that day, after all the equipment on the train had been tested and adjusted, the Soviet electrical expert who personally controlled the paralleling of the grid turned the switch on the main electrical panel to the right, and the pointer of the power meter immediately moved slightly to the right, and the power train generated current for the first time. The biggest advantage of this power plant is that it can travel along the railway to any place where electricity is needed.
    In recent years, the industrial development in Jiamusi area has been rapid. In addition to the existing coal mines, textiles, machinery, rice milling and timber processing industries in this area, some mines and factories are currently under construction. Therefore, the electricity generated by the original Jiamusi Power Plant cannot meet the demand. Whenever the power plant repairs its machines, the electricity consumption of many factories will be restricted. After the train power plant starts supplying electricity, the shortage of electricity in Jiamusi area can be changed. The electricity it generates can supply the existing industry and lighting in the entire city of Jiamusi.
    This train power plant does not have tall factory buildings, and all the equipment is installed in thirteen carriages. The construction cost is also lower than that of ordinary fixed power plants. After all the equipment of this train power plant was transported to the site on April 24, it took only more than a month to build it.

    The southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is laid to the Sichuan-Shaanxi border
    On May 28, the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was laid to Datan Station on the Sichuan-Shaanxi border. Datan is 367 kilometers away from Chengdu and is the last township in Sichuan Province on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The key projects exiting Sichuan Province, the Yangpingguan Tunnel and the lower structure of the Jialing River No. 1 Bridge, were completed in mid-May. The construction preparation from Lueyang, Shaanxi Province to Huangsha River section of Huixian County, Gansu Province has also been basically completed, and the main line key bridges, tunnels, and roadbed earthwork projects have started construction one after another. Tens of thousands of laborers and thousands of vehicles and boats are now advancing from south to north. Soon, this section will be fully constructed. (Reported by our reporter stationed in Chengdu)
    Two highways in Tibet start construction
    The Lhasa-Xigaze Highway started construction in late May. The first phase of the task is to improve the more than 30-kilometer-long access road west of Yangbajing and open the Xugela (mountain) with an altitude of 5,300 meters.
    When the road construction workers entered the work area west of Yangbajing from the Kangding-Tibet Highway improvement project site, they were warmly welcomed and entertained by the workers maintaining and improving the western section of the Kangding-Tibet Highway and the road construction troops on the Lhasa-Yangbajing section of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. Herdsmen on the Yangbajing grassland brought them yak dung (fuel) from afar. The First Engineering Bureau of the Highway Administration has transported a large amount of staple and non-staple foods and materials to the construction site. The two survey teams working between Yangbajing and Xigaze have completed more than 60 kilometers of survey and alignment work. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    The construction of the Xigaze-Gyangze Highway started in full swing on June 1. According to the planned schedule, the roadbed project of the entire 93-kilometer line (6 kilometers have been completed during the trial construction) will be completed in about three months.
    At the commencement ceremony, Hou Jie, commander of the road construction headquarters, Tubden Cidan, deputy commander and Kempo of the Tibet Local Government, and Tuang Kang Sonam Dorje, member of the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee, conveyed to the migrant workers the State Council’s method of providing relief through work, the important significance of road construction for improving internal transportation in Tibet, and the care of the State Council and the Chinese Communist Party for the people in the disaster-stricken areas last year. Tudeng Danda, Secretary General of Zecang of the Tibet Local Government, and Danzeng Jiacuo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee, also spoke at the meeting. They said that they would do their best to support the construction of the highway. Nima Shenfu, a representative of the migrant workers, said at the meeting: We will definitely complete the road construction task, work hard to restore and develop production in the disaster-stricken areas last year, and build a happy hometown.

    Construction of the Chonglongshan Iron Mine reconstruction project
    The reconstruction project of the Chonglongshan Iron Mine of the state-owned Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant started construction on June 1. From morning to night, trains and cars transported workers and a large number of building materials to the construction site. Workers in rock drilling and other types of work are stripping waste rock on the top of the mountain, which is more than 400 meters above sea level.
    The exploitation of the Chonglongshan Iron Mine is another iron mine of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant after the reconstruction of Nanshan Iron Mine. The ore here is very good, and the pig iron smelted from this ore is of high quality and consumes less coke. After the reconstruction, the iron mine will be fully mechanized from production to transportation.
    The iron ore in the Chonglongshan area was looted and destroyed by Japanese imperialism during the Anti-Japanese War, and the mine was destroyed into cliffs and cliffs. Therefore, the reconstruction project is very difficult. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Scientists discover the source of laver spores
    China's marine biologists have solved a long-standing problem in laver research - the source of laver spores.
    Laver contains a large amount of various vitamins, inorganic salts, sugars and proteins, and is an excellent edible seaweed. Every autumn, for about two or three weeks, a large number of laver spores appear on the sea surface. These spores are the "seeds" for laver reproduction. They attach to rocks or other objects and grow into laver. But where do these spores come from? This is a problem that the scientific community has not solved for a long time. If the source of spores cannot be known, people cannot use scientific methods to breed laver.
    Since 1952, scientists from the Institute of Oceanography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Michurin's advanced academic thought on the unity of organisms and the environment, have conducted more than two years of research on the life history of laver, and finally solved the problem that scholars from Japan, the United Kingdom and other countries have not been able to solve completely - discovered the source of laver spores. This research result not only understands the laws of the life cycle of laver, but also can use scientific methods to provide the spores needed for laver cultivation, so as to cultivate laver in large quantities and supply it for people to eat.

    Xinjiang carries out wasteland surveying and design work
    The two survey teams, four surveying teams, and two design teams affiliated to the Xinjiang Provincial Wasteland Survey and Design Bureau are currently conducting wasteland survey and design work. It is planned to survey 6.5 million mu of wasteland in the Junggar Basin, Turpan Basin, Kaidu River, Peacock River Basin and Aksu in southern and northern Xinjiang this year, and complete the survey of 2.2 million mu and the planning and design of more than 2 million mu of land.
    These tasks are usually carried out in reeds taller than people and dense red willow and cogon grass bushes. Team members have to use their hands to push aside or cut off these obstacles with sickles to move forward. The first survey team, which was responsible for submitting survey data of 600,000 mu of wasteland before May 10, sometimes worked in the field for up to 15 consecutive hours; the team members also automatically helped the farmers who assisted in the survey work to carry out production; after completing the work plan on time, they accepted a new task of surveying 200,000 mu of wasteland.

    Vegetable farms are established in the suburbs of Hailar
    A new vegetable farm with 43 hectares of arable land has been established in the suburbs of Hailar City, Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region this year. The farm has now sown more than 20 hectares of vegetables such as potatoes, shallots, spinach, and Chinese cabbage. It has also cultivated 300 square meters of cabbage, tomato, cucumber and other vegetable seedlings. By early June, these seedlings can be transplanted to the ground. After August, the farm can produce 1 million catties of various vegetables to meet the needs of the people of Hailar. This winter, the farm also plans to build three greenhouses to cultivate vegetables so that people can eat fresh vegetables even in the cold winter. In addition, the farm also plans to greatly develop the production of dairy cows, pork pigs, etc. (Pan Changsheng)

    在社会主义的道路上前进
    兰新铁路黄河正桥主体工程提前完工
    我国人民亲手修建的第一座黄河大桥——兰新铁路黄河正桥的主体工程，已经在六月一日比计划日期提前十四天全部完工。现在大桥的全部桥墩、桥台已经露出河面。工人们正在加紧修筑桥头铁路线。架桥用的钢梁正陆续运到工地。在黄河洪水来到以前，大桥就可架梁通车了。
    兰新铁路黄河正桥是一九五四年四月一日正式开工修建的。施工过程中，职工们积极学习苏联先进经验，进行了创造性的劳动。他们英勇地战胜了洪水、流冰、严寒等困难，在保证质量的原则下，终于提前完成了任务。
   全国人民对这座大桥的工程进行了各方面的支援。汉口、锦州等地的造船、潜水工人，曾在施工准备时期和工程紧张阶段给予了援助。各地许多工厂为大桥输送了各种器材。当地农民在两万个以上的工日里为大桥工地进行了备料、造房子等工作。　（本报驻兰州记者）
    第一座现代化列车发电厂发电
    我国第一座现代化的列车发电厂六月一日在佳木斯开始供电。这天上午十点半钟，当列车上所有设备都经过试验、调整妥当以后，亲自掌握并车的苏联电气专家把主电盘上的开关向右一扭，电力表的指针立刻轻轻向右移动，动力列车就第一次发出了电流。这座发电厂的最大优点是可以沿着铁路，开行到任何一个需要电力的地方去。
    几年来，佳木斯地区的工业发展很快。这个地区除了原有的煤矿、纺织、机械、制米和木材加工等工业外，目前还正在建设一些矿井和工厂。因此，原有佳木斯发电厂发出的电力，就供不应求了。每当发电厂检修机器的时候，许多工厂的用电就要受到限制。列车发电厂开始供电以后，佳木斯地区电力缺少的情况就可以得到改变。它发出的电力，约可供佳木斯全市现有工业和照明之用。
    这座列车发电厂没有高大的厂房，全部设备安装在十三节车厢里。建设费用也比一般固定电厂低。这座列车发电厂的全部设备在四月二十四日运到现场以后，只用了一个多月的时间，就把它建设好了。

    宝成路南段铺轨到川陕边界
    五月二十八日，宝成铁路南段铺轨到川陕边界的大滩车站。大滩距成都三百六十七公里，是宝成路在四川境内的最后一座乡镇。出四川省的重点工程阳平关隧道和嘉陵江一号大桥下部建筑工程，都已在五月中旬先后完工。从陕西省略阳到甘肃省徽县黄沙河段的施工准备也已经大体就绪，正线重点桥梁、隧道、路基土石方工程已经相继开工。数万劳动大军和成千的车辆、船只，现在正从南向北前进。不久，这一段即将展开全面施工。                 （本报驻成都记者）
    西藏两条公路开工修筑
    拉萨到日喀则公路已在五月下旬开工修筑。第一阶段的任务是改善羊八井以西三十多公里的便道和打通拔海五千三百公尺的旭格拉（山）。
    筑路工人在从康藏公路改善工程工地进入羊八井以西工区时，受到康藏公路西段养护、改善工人和青藏公路拉萨到羊八井段筑路部队的热烈欢迎和招待。羊八井草原上的牧民们从远道给他们送来牛粪（燃料）。公路总局第一工程局已把大量的主副食品和料具等运送到工地。在羊八井到日喀则间工作的两个测量队，已完成了六十多公里的测量定线工作。　（据新华社讯）
    修筑日喀则到江孜公路的工程六月一日全面开工。按照预定计划，全线九十三公里（试修时已完成六公里）路基工程将在三个月左右的时间内完成。
    在开工典礼大会上，修路指挥部指挥长侯杰、副指挥长西藏地方政府堪穷土登慈丹、班禅堪布会议厅委员会委员团康·索南多吉先后向民工传达了国务院以工代赈办法，筑路对改善西藏内部交通的重要意义，以及国务院和中国共产党对去年受灾地区人民的关怀。西藏地方政府泽仓大秘书土登丹达、班禅堪布会议厅委员会副秘书长丹增嘉错也在会上讲话，他们表示要尽力支援修筑公路。民工代表尼玛申甫在大会上说：我们一定胜利完成筑路任务，努力恢复和发展去年受灾地区的生产，建设幸福的家乡。　（据新华社讯）
    长龙山铁矿重建工程施工
    国营马鞍山炼铁厂长龙山铁矿重建工程在六月一日施工。每天从早到晚，火车和汽车把工人和大批建筑材料运往工地。凿岩等工种的工人，正在拔海四百多公尺高的山顶上剥离废石。
    长龙山铁矿的开采，是马鞍山炼铁厂继南山铁矿重建后的又一个铁矿。这里的矿石很好，用这种矿石冶炼出来的生铁，质量高，消耗的焦炭也少。重建后的铁矿，从生产到运输将全部是机械化的。
    长龙山地区的铁矿，在抗日时期曾遭受日本帝国主义的掠夺和破坏，矿山被破坏成悬崖绝壁，因此，重建工程十分艰巨。　（新华社）
    科学家发现紫菜胞子的来源
    我国的海洋生物学家解决了紫菜研究中的一项悬案——紫菜胞子的来源问题。
    紫菜含有大量的各种维生素、无机盐类、糖类和蛋白质，是一种优良的食用海藻。每年秋季，大约在二、三周的短期内，紫菜胞子大量出现于海面，这些胞子就是紫菜繁殖的“种子”，它们附着在岩石或其他物体上，生长成为紫菜。但这些胞子到底从那里来的？这是科学界长期以来没有解决的问题。胞子的来源不能知道，人们就不能用科学的方法来繁殖紫菜。
    中国科学院海洋生物研究室的科学家自一九五二年开始，在米丘林关于生物体和环境统一性的先进学术思想指导下，对紫菜生活史进行了两年多的研究，终于解决了日本、英国等国家的学者长期没能彻底解决的问题——发现了紫菜胞子的来源。这项研究成果不但了解了紫菜生活循环的规律，并能用科学方法提供养殖紫菜所需要的胞子，来大量养殖紫菜，供应人民食用。　（新华社）
    新疆进行荒地勘测设计工作
    新疆省荒地勘测设计局所属的两个调查队、四个勘测队、两个设计队目前正在进行着荒地调查勘测设计工作。计划今年内在南北疆的准噶尔盆地、吐鲁番盆地以及开都河、孔雀河流域和阿克苏等地调查荒地六百五十万亩，并完成二百二十万亩的勘测和二百多万亩土地的规划设计工作。
    这些工作通常是在高过人头的芦苇和密茂的红柳、芨芨草丛中进行，队员们要用双手拨开或用镰刀砍掉这些障碍物才能前进。负责在五月十日前提出六十万亩荒地调查资料的调查一队，有时野外工作时间连续达十五小时；队员们还自动帮助协助调查工作的农民进行生产；他们按时完成工作计划后，又接受了新的调查荒地二十万亩的任务。            （本报集体通讯员新疆日报编辑部）
    海拉尔市郊建立蔬菜农场
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟海拉尔市郊区，今年新建立了一个拥有耕地四十三公顷的蔬菜农场。这个农场现已播种了二十多公顷马铃薯、小葱、菠菜、小白菜等蔬菜。还培育了三百平方公尺的甘蓝、番茄、黄瓜等菜苗。到六月上旬，这些菜苗即可移植到大地上。八月以后，农场即可生产一百万斤各种蔬菜，供应海拉尔人民的需要。今冬农场还准备建设三座温室栽培蔬菜，让人们在寒冷的冬天也能吃到新鲜蔬菜。此外，农场还计划大量发展乳牛、毛猪等生产。　（潘长生）
