Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 18th (Teletype from the German News Agency) The Press Office of the Premier of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement saying that the Government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the forthcoming meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, considering this meeting a new opportunity for further easing international tensions and promoting the resolution of outstanding international issues.

The statement emphasized that the Government of the German Democratic Republic and all patriotic Germans are most concerned with the peaceful resolution of the German question, and that positive results from the Geneva Four-Power Conference could promote the resolution of this issue. However, the Government of the German Democratic Republic emphasized that it still believes that the greatest contribution to reunification must be made by the Germans themselves, through mutual understanding on the path to reunification. The Government of the German Democratic Republic once again declares its willingness to hold meetings with representatives of West Germany at any time to discuss this issue.

The Government of the German Democratic Republic believes that it is a natural conclusion that, in the negotiations on the German question, representatives of both parts of Germany should have the opportunity to express their opinions on the reunification of Germany and Germany's contribution to peace and security.

    德意志民主共和国政府
    就即将举行的四大国会议问题发表声明
    新华社柏林十八日电　德意志通讯社十七日讯：德意志民主共和国总理新闻处发表声明说，德意志民主共和国政府欢迎即将举行的苏联、美国、英国和法国的政府首脑会议，认为这个会议是进一步缓和国际紧张局势和促进悬而未决的国际问题的解决的一个新的机会。
    声明着重指出，德意志民主共和国政府和所有爱国的德国人最关切的就是和平解决德国问题，而日内瓦四国会议的积极结果就能促进这个问题的解决。但是，德意志民主共和国政府强调指出，它仍然认为走向重新统一的最大的贡献必然要由德国人自己，由双方在实现重新统一的途径上取得谅解来作出。德意志民主共和国政府再一次声明愿意在任何时间同西德的代表举行会议，讨论这个问题。
    德意志民主共和国政府认为这是一个当然的结论：在关于德国问题的谈判中，德国的两部分的代表都应有机会发表他们对于德国的重新统一和德国对和平安全的贡献问题的意见。
