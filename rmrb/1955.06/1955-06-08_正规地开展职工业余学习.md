    Regularly Carry Out Spare-Time Learning for Workers and Staff
    Industry Department of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    In the past year, the management level of various factories and mines in Kunming has improved to varying degrees. The phenomenon of working overtime and rushing production has been basically overcome, and a normal production order has been initially established. However, in the past, due to the lack of unified and reasonable arrangements for workers' and staff's spare-time activities, many enterprises had too many meetings and activities. Workers' spare-time political theory and cultural learning time was often occupied by various meetings and spare-time activities, and technical education for workers and staff could never be conducted in a regular manner.
    In January of this year, the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision on regularly carrying out spare-time activities for workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises, requiring all industrial and mining enterprise departments to establish night Party schools and spare-time schools for workers and staff under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and to arrange spare-time activities time in a unified and reasonable manner. The night Party school mainly conducts systematic education on basic knowledge of the Party and the Communist Youth League for Party members and League members, with the Party committee secretary and League committee secretary serving as the principal and vice-principal, respectively. The spare-time school for workers and staff mainly conducts systematic education on political theory, cultural, and technical knowledge for workers and staff, with the administrative deputy director of the factory and the chairman of the trade union serving as the principal and vice-principal, respectively. It establishes worker political classes, theory classes, culture classes, crash literacy classes, technical classes, and Russian classes, and organizes classes and grades for learning according to different objects and levels. The decision also stipulates that in addition to normal production time, the spare-time activity time for workers and staff in various industrial and mining enterprise departments should not exceed twelve hours per week, including two hours for political classes for all workers and staff, mainly conducting education on current affairs and policies and implementing central work; four to six hours each for political, theoretical, cultural, technical, and Russian language studies; two hours for trade union activities; and two hours for Party and League life. The meeting activity time before and after shifts in production should generally be limited to no more than fifteen minutes. The remaining time is for workers and staff to rest, cultural entertainment, reading newspapers, and sports activities.
    After the Municipal Committee's decision on regularly carrying out spare-time activities was announced, some factories and mines had a relatively good understanding and implementation of this decision. For example, the Party committee of the Kunming Electric Motor Factory carefully studied the factory's situation, analyzed the reasons for the confusion and waste in the use of spare time in the past, and adopted effective measures such as streamlining meetings, improving meeting quality, and reducing the number of positions held by activists concurrently. It also actively improved enterprise management and Party work, changed the situation of insufficient time, and arranged spare time in a unified and reasonable manner. Under the leadership of the Party committee, it carried out complex organizational work for workers' and staff's spare-time learning and repeated ideological education work meticulously. Therefore, the factory's spare-time activities for workers and staff were carried out smoothly. However, some factories and mines did not have sufficient understanding of the significance of regularly carrying out spare-time activities and emphasized objective difficulties. For example, some factory leaders reflected: "Our factory's production order is chaotic, there are many meetings, a lot of work, and time is too tight, and it is difficult to arrange spare time." Some leaders lack confidence in further improving their work level and meeting quality, and believe that if the use of spare time is fixed in the future and cannot be occupied casually, there will be no time for meetings. Therefore, they leave more flexible time when arranging the schedule. Some factories also proposed to allow theoretical learning to occupy production time, and some units simply regarded regularly carrying out spare-time activities as a matter of setting up a framework, scheduling time, drawing up courses, and hiring teachers. After the Municipal Committee convened a meeting of the principals of spare-time schools for workers and staff and night Party schools in various factories and mines, it further clarified the significance of regularly carrying out spare-time activities, and also studied issues such as the organizational leadership, teaching principles, and objects of spare-time learning. Therefore, this work was further promoted.
    The new situation that has emerged since regularly carrying out spare-time activities is that the chaotic state of spare time use in the past has been basically overcome, and spare-time meetings and various learning activities have begun to get on the right track, thus promoting the establishment of a normal working order and production order in enterprises. For example, some staff members of the Kunming Smelter said: "In the past, sometimes the Party Committee Propaganda Department would notify us of theoretical learning, the trade union would notify us of production inspection, and the administration would discuss technical operating procedures on the same night. The staff did not know which one to do well. Now that spare time is arranged in a unified manner, this chaotic phenomenon has been overcome." At the same time, due to the rational arrangement and use of spare time, meetings were streamlined, and the quality of meetings was improved, which also promoted the improvement of enterprise management and Party leadership. For example, units such as the Kunming Electric Motor Factory and the Kunming Smelter streamlined factory-level meetings, and each meeting was fully prepared in advance, so that problems could be truly solved at the meeting. The development of regular spare-time activities has also ensured the normal progress of workers' and staff's spare-time learning, cultural and sports activities, and the rest of workers and staff. Therefore, the enthusiasm of workers and staff for learning has generally increased. Many factories and mining enterprises have each worker and staff member participating in a kind of learning. Since the start of classes at the Kunming Electric Motor Factory, the general attendance rate has reached 95%. Some classes and groups have formulated learning covenants and disciplines, and some League members and young workers have also formulated learning plans. Because spare-time activities have been put on the right track, cultural and entertainment activities have also been further developed. The Kunming Electric Motor Factory has organized activities such as basketball games, speeches, singing, flower lantern groups, storytelling, and youth lectures. In the past, some workers who had nothing to do went to teahouses on the street, but now they have been attracted to various activities.
    However, the development of regular spare-time activities for workers and staff in various factories and mines is only the beginning. Some factories and mines still have the phenomenon of working overtime and holding meetings during workers' rest and after-dinner time; some factories and mining enterprises have not yet established worker political classes, technical classes, and Party classes in night Party schools. It is still necessary to continue to solve problems such as teaching materials and teachers, and actively plan to start classes, so as to comprehensively develop the various spare-time learning activities of workers and staff.

    正规地开展职工业余学习
    中共昆明市委工业部
    一年来，昆明市各厂矿企业的管理水平都有不同程度的提高，加班加点，突击生产的现象已基本克服，正常的生产秩序已初步建立。但过去由于对职工业余活动缺乏统一合理的安排，很多企业单位会议活动过多，职工的业余政治理论学习和文化学习时间经常被各种会议和业余活动占了，职工的技术教育也始终不能正规地进行。
    中共昆明市委今年一月作出了关于在工矿企业中正规开展职工业余活动的决定，要求各工矿企业部门在党委统一领导下分别成立夜党校和职工业余学校，统一合理地安排职工业余活动时间。夜党校主要是对党、团员进行系统的党、团基本知识的教育，由党委书记、团委书记分任正副校长；职工业余学校主要是对工人和工作人员进行系统的政治理论和文化技术知识的教育，由行政副厂长、工会主席分任正副校长，下设工人政治班、理论班、文化班、速成识字班、技术班和俄文班，按不同对象、程度分别编班编级学习。决定中并规定各工矿企业部门除正常生产时间外，职工业余活动时间每周不得超过十二小时，计全体职工政治大课二小时，主要进行时事政策教育及贯彻中心工作的教育；政治、理论、文化、技术和俄文的学习各四小时至六小时，工会活动两小时，党团生活两小时。生产中班前班后会议活动时间一般以不超过十五分钟为限，其他时间都是职工群众休息、文化娱乐、看报及体育活动时间。
    市委关于正规开展职工业余活动的决定宣布后，有的厂矿对这个决定的认识和贯彻是比较好的。如昆明电机厂党委认真研究了本厂情况，分析了过去业余时间的使用上存在混乱和浪费现象的原因，采取精简会议，提高会议质量、减少积极分子兼职等有效办法，并积极提高企业管理水平和党的工作水平，改变了时间不够用的状况，统一合理地安排了业余时间。在党委领导下周密地进行了职工业余学习的复杂组织工作和反复的思想教育工作，因而该厂职工业余活动顺利地开展了。但也有一些厂矿对于正规开展职工业余活动的意义认识不足，强调客观困难。如有的厂负责人员反映：
  “我们厂生产秩序较乱，会议多，工作多，时间太紧，业余时间很难安排”。有些领导人员对进一步提高工作水平和会议质量缺乏信心，认为今后业余时间的用途都固定下来了，不能随便占用，这样一来便没有开会的时间了，因而在安排的时候便多留一些机动时间。也有的厂提出要让理论学习占用生产时间，也有的单位把正规开展业余活动简单地看成只是搭架子、排时间、拟课程和聘教员的问题。经过市委召集各厂矿职工业余学校和夜党校校长会议，进一步明确了正规开展职工业余活动的意义，对于业余学习的组织领导、教学方针和对象等方面的问题也作了研究。因而进一步推动了这项工作。
    在正规开展职工业余活动以后出现的新情况是：过去业余时间使用上的混乱状态基本上克服了，业余的会议活动和各种学习开始走上了正轨，因而促进了企业正常工作秩序和生产秩序的建立。如昆明冶炼厂有的工作人员说：“过去有时在同一个晚上党委宣传部通知是理论学习，工会通知要检查生产，行政又要讨论技术操作规程，工作人员也不知搞那样好，现在统一安排了业余时间，这种混乱现象就克服了。”同时由于合理地安排和使用业余时间，精简了会议，提高了会议质量，也促进了企业的管理水平和党的领导水平的提高，如昆明电机厂和昆明冶炼厂等单位，精简了厂一级的会议，每次会议都事前充分作好准备，会上真能解决问题。正规业余活动的开展，也保证了职工业余学习和文娱体育活动的正常进行和职工的休息，因而职工的学习情绪普遍高涨，很多厂矿企业每个职工都已参加了一种学习。昆明电机厂自开学上课以来，一般出勤率都达到百分之九十五。有的班、组订了学习公约和纪律，有的团员和青年工人还订了学习计划。由于业余活动上了正轨，文娱活动也进一步开展起来了。昆明电机厂组织了篮球比赛、讲演会、歌咏、花灯组、说评书和青年讲座等活动。过去有些工人没事干到街上去坐茶馆，现在都被吸引到各项活动中来了。
    但是，现在各厂矿开展正规的职工业余活动还只是开始，有的厂矿仍然有在职工休息和饭后时间加班开会的现象；有的厂矿企业的工人政治班、技术班和夜党校的党课班等还没有建立，还须继续解决教材、教员等问题，积极筹划开班，以便把职工各项业余学习全面地开展起来。
