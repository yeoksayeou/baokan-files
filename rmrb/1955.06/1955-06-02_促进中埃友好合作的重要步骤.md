An important step in promoting Sino-Egyptian friendly cooperation

Following the victorious conclusion of the world-瞩目ed Asian-African Conference, Mr. Ahmed Hassan Al-Baquri, Minister of Religious Affairs of the Government of the Republic of Egypt, and Mr. Mustafa Kamel, Professor of Constitutional Law at Cairo University, came to China last month at the invitation of the Chinese government delegation to the Asian-African Conference. During their visit to China, they called on Premier Zhou Enlai and heads of government departments, contacted the broad masses, and received a warm welcome from the Chinese government and people. Representatives of the Egyptian government also held talks with representatives of the Chinese government on issues of promoting trade cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and Egypt. During the talks, representatives of both sides expressed the common desire of the Chinese and Egyptian governments and peoples for friendly cooperation in a friendly atmosphere, and reached a consensus on many issues.

Both China and Egypt are countries with abundant resources and are famous cradles of ancient culture in the world. The people of both our countries have created a brilliant ancient culture. Egypt built the world-famous pyramids as early as 5,000 years ago, and had a relatively complete writing system more than 3,600 years ago. Ancient Egyptian literature, mathematics, medicine, astronomy, and architecture have made tremendous contributions to all mankind and constitute an important part of the world's cultural heritage.

However, in modern times, both China and Egypt have suffered from imperialist plunder and oppression, resulting in economic and cultural backwardness, and hindering economic and cultural cooperation between the two sides. Therefore, after the Asian-African Conference, it is urgently needed and warmly welcomed by both sides to carry out economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and Egypt on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. As Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech at the plenary session of the Asian-African Conference: "Trade exchanges and economic cooperation between us should be aimed at promoting the independent economic development of all countries, and should not make any party simply a raw material production area and a sales market for consumer goods. Cultural exchanges between us should respect the development of national cultures in all countries, without obliterating the characteristics and advantages of any country, so as to learn from and observe each other." The wishes expressed and agreements reached in the trade and cultural cooperation talks between China and Egypt are fully in line with the interests of the Chinese and Egyptian peoples.

Through trade exchanges and mutual learning and observation in cultural aspects, China and Egypt will further enhance mutual understanding between the two peoples and establish and develop the sincere friendship between the two peoples. The establishment and strengthening of friendly relations between China and Egypt will have a positive impact on the cause of maintaining world peace. Therefore, the trade and cultural cooperation talks between China and Egypt are a joint effort by the governments and peoples of China and Egypt to promote the implementation of the resolutions and declarations of the Asian-African Conference.

We thank Egyptian Minister Baquri and Professor Kamel for the spirit of friendship and cooperation shown in this meeting. We welcome their visit and the success of the Sino-Egyptian trade and cultural cooperation talks. At the same time, we sincerely hope that the economic and cultural cooperation between China and Egypt can be realized as soon as possible, which will be very beneficial to the development of friendship between China and Egypt and to the defense of peace in the Asian-African region and the world.

    促进中埃友好合作的重要步骤
    在举世瞩目的亚非会议胜利闭幕之后，埃及共和国政府宗教事务部部长艾哈迈德·哈萨尼·巴库尔和开罗大学宪法教授穆斯塔法·卡迈尔，应我国政府出席亚非会议代表团的邀请，于上月前来我国访问。他们在访问中国的期间，拜访了我国周恩来总理和政府部门的负责人，接触了广大的群众，受到了我国政府和人民的热烈欢迎。埃及政府代表并同我国政府代表就增进中埃两国之间的贸易合作和文化交流问题举行了会谈。在会谈中，双方代表在友好的空气中表达了中埃两国政府和人民友好合作的共同愿望，并在许多问题上取得了一致的意见。
    中埃两国都是具有丰富资源的国家，都是世界上有名的古代文化的摇篮，我们两国人民都曾经创造过光辉灿烂的古代文化。埃及在五千年前就已建筑了世界闻名的金字塔，三千六百多年前就已有了较完善的文字。埃及古代的文学、数学、医学、天文学、建筑术等，都曾经对全人类作出了巨大贡献，构成了世界文化遗产的重要部分。
    但近代以来，由于中埃两国都遭受了帝国主义的掠夺和压迫，造成了经济上和文化上的落后状态，同时阻碍了双方在经济和文化上的合作。因此，在亚非会议后，中埃两国在平等互利、互相尊重的基础上，实行经济合作和文化交流，就为双方所迫切需要和热烈欢迎了。这正如周恩来总理在亚非会议全体会议上的发言中所说的：“我们相互之间的贸易来往和经济合作应该以促进各国独立经济发展为目的，而不应该使任何一方单纯地成为原料产地和消费品的销售市场。我们相互之间的文化交流应该尊重各国民族文化的发展，而不抹煞任何一国的特长和优点，以便互相学习和观摩。”中埃两国关于贸易和文化合作会谈中所表达的愿望和达成的协议，是完全符合于中埃两国人民的利益的。
    中埃两国通过在贸易上的互通有无，在文化方面的互相学习和观摩，将进一步增进两国人民的互相了解，建立和发展两国人民的真诚友谊。而中埃两国友好关系的建立和加强，对维护世界和平的事业必将发生良好的影响。因此，中埃双方对贸易和文化合作的会谈，正是中埃两国政府和人民对促进亚非会议的决议和宣言的实现所做的共同努力。
    我们感谢埃及巴库尔部长和卡迈尔教授在这次会谈中所表现的友好和合作的精神。我们欢迎他们这次的访问和中埃贸易和文化合作会谈的成功。同时我们热诚地希望中埃两国经济和文化的合作能够尽速实现，这对于发展中埃两国友谊，保卫亚非地区和全世界的和平，都将是十分有利的。
