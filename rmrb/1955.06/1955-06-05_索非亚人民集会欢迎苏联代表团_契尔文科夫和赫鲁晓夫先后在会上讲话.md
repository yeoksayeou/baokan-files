Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 4th—TASS reports from Sofia: The Soviet government delegation consisting of N.S. Khrushchev, N.A. Bulganin, and A.I. Mikoyan, arrived in Sofia from Belgrade on June 3rd for an official friendly visit at the invitation of the Bulgarian government and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party.
    Those who went to the airport to welcome the delegation included: Vulko Chervenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria; Georgi Damyanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly; Raiko Damyanov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Todor Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Bulgaria; Georgi Tsankov, Encho Staikov and General Ivan Mihailov, members of the Central Political Bureau of the Bulgarian Communist Party; and T. Prahov, Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Bulgaria, and others.
    Also present to welcome the delegation were diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union and other countries to Bulgaria.
    The Soviet government delegation went directly from the airport to "September 9th" Square in Sofia, to attend a mass rally attended by 200,000 people.
    Chervenkov addressed the meeting, first extending a warm welcome to the Soviet government delegation on behalf of the Bulgarian people. Chervenkov said that the visit of Comrades Khrushchev, Bulganin, and Mikoyan to our country is a matter of great honor and joy for us. This visit vividly demonstrates the unbreakable fraternal friendship that permanently links the Soviet and Bulgarian peoples, the complete unity of our interests and goals, and our common desire to uphold and consolidate peace. Our gratitude to the Soviet Union and the Soviet people is boundless. Thanks to their continuous and selfless assistance, we are economically and politically transforming our country along the path of socialism, industrializing it, transforming its agriculture, and developing its productive forces.
    Chervenkov said: We are pleased to congratulate the Soviet delegation that participated in the Belgrade talks and signed the Soviet-Yugoslav government declaration, which undoubtedly is a fruitful contribution to the cause of peace.
    Next, Khrushchev spoke at the meeting. He first extended warm and heartfelt greetings to the Bulgarian people on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev said: We are extremely pleased to convey the brotherly greetings and best wishes of the Soviet people to the Bulgarian people.
    Khrushchev said that Comrade Chervenkov and other leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government have invited us to visit your country more than once. We accepted such an invitation with great pleasure. We note with great satisfaction that the friendship between our two peoples is constantly developing and strengthening for the benefit of both peoples and for strengthening the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. The Soviet people are sincerely delighted with all the achievements of the Bulgarian people under the leadership of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party.
    Khrushchev said, we came here from Belgrade, where we held talks with the leaders of Yugoslavia. These talks were conducted in a spirit of friendship and mutual understanding, and culminated in the signing of a joint declaration by the governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. In the course of the negotiations, both governments demonstrated a sincere desire to further develop comprehensive cooperation between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, which is fully in line with the interests of both countries, the interests of the people of other countries, and the interests of peace and socialism.
    As a result of the Soviet-Yugoslav negotiations, the period of disruption of good relations between our two countries has ended. It is quite obvious that such disruption of relations between our two countries only benefited the reactionary and aggressive forces of imperialism, because they try their best to instigate conflict among the people of all countries, sow discord among them, in order to facilitate the realization of their anti-popular insidious plots.
    Today we can already say that the road to establishing and developing friendly relations between the Soviet Union and all People's Democracies and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia has been opened. During our stay in Yugoslavia, we talked with the leaders of the Yugoslav government and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and with Comrade Tito, the President of the Yugoslav Republic. We visited many regions of Yugoslavia, talked with workers, and we saw that although Yugoslavia has suffered various difficulties due to the disruption of its relations with our countries, Yugoslavia has not abandoned its sovereignty and has fully maintained its national independence in the face of the imperialist camp.
    As a result of the talks, a healthy and normal situation has emerged, clearing the way for further development of friendly relations and all-round cooperation between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.
    The improvement of Soviet-Yugoslav relations is a new contribution to easing international tensions and consolidating the cause of peace. There is no doubt that the Soviet-Yugoslav talks will serve the interests of all peace-loving peoples of all countries and the interests of the working people of all countries, who welcomed the news of the good results of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks with approval. The people of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies welcome the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks with particular satisfaction, because the people of these countries have been linked with the Yugoslav people for many years by the joint struggle for the common cause.
    The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Bulgaria have always consistently and firmly pursued a policy of peace and struggled to ease international tensions. Along with us, the great People's Republic of China and all the People's Democracies, as well as all peace-loving people, are defending this policy which is in the interests of the people of all countries. The strength of our powerful socialist camp and our confidence that no conspiracy of reactionary and aggressive blocs can hinder our progress is growing and strengthening day by day.
    Each country in this camp is making a contribution to our common cause. The glorious Bulgarian people have made a considerable contribution to the cause of striving for peace and strengthening the position of socialism. The better the work of the working people of our countries is done, the more consolidated the cause of peace and the cause of socialism will be! Comrades! Let us work selflessly for the victory of this great cause!
    The speeches of Chervenkov and Khrushchev were warmly welcomed by those present and were repeatedly interrupted by stormy and prolonged applause and cheers.

    索非亚人民集会欢迎苏联代表团
    契尔文科夫和赫鲁晓夫先后在会上讲话
    新华社四日讯　据塔斯社索非亚讯：由尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫、尼·亚·布尔加宁和阿·伊·米高扬组成的苏联政府代表团，应保加利亚政府和保加利亚共产党中央委员会的邀请，在六月三日从贝尔格莱德到达索非亚，作正式的友好访问。
    前往机场欢迎的有：保加利亚部长会议主席伏·契尔文科夫，国民议会主席团主席格·达米扬诺夫，部长会议副主席拉·达米扬诺夫，保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记托·日夫科夫，保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员格·赞科夫、恩·斯塔伊科夫和伊·米哈伊洛夫大将，保加利亚工会中央理事会主席托·普拉霍夫等。
    前往欢迎的还有苏联和各国驻保加利亚的外交使节。
    苏联政府代表团直接从机场前往索非亚“九九”广场，出席在那里举行的有二十万人参加的群众大会。
    契尔文科夫在会上致词，他首先代表保加利亚人民热烈欢迎苏联政府代表团。契尔文科夫说，赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁和米高扬几位同志访问我国，对我国来说是一件十分光荣和值得高兴的事，这次访问生动地表现了把苏联人民和我国人民永久联系在
  一起的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊，表现了我们利益和目的的完全一致以及我们拥护和巩固和平的共同愿望。我们对于苏联和苏联人民的感谢是无限的，由于他们的不断的和无私的帮助，我们正沿着社会主义的道路来从经济上和政治上改造我们的国家，实行工业化，改造它的农业，发展它的生产力。
    契尔文科夫说：我们高兴地向参加贝尔格莱德会谈和签署了苏南政府的宣言的苏联代表团祝贺，这些会谈和签署的宣言无疑地是对和平事业的卓有成效的贡献。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫在大会上讲话。他首先代表苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团向保加利亚人民致热烈的恳切的问候。赫鲁晓夫说：我们极其高兴地将苏联人民的兄弟问候和最好的祝愿转达给保加利亚人民。
    赫鲁晓夫说，契尔文科夫同志和保加利亚共产党和政府的其他领导人曾不止一次地邀请我们访问你们的国家。我们非常乐意地接受了这样的邀请。我们十分满意地指出，我们两国人民的友谊在为两国人民的幸福和为加强和平、民主和社会主义阵营的利益而不断地发展和巩固起来。苏联人民对保加利亚人民在光荣的保加利亚共产党领导下取得的一切成就感到衷心的喜悦。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们是从贝尔格莱德来到你们这里的，我们在那里同南斯拉夫的领导人员举行了会谈。这些会谈是本着友好和互相谅解的精神进行的，并且以签署苏联和南斯拉夫两国政府的联合宣言而圆满结束。在谈判进程中，两国政府都表现了要求进一步发展南斯拉夫和苏联之间的全面合作的真诚愿望，这是同两国的利益、同其他国家人民的利益、同和平和社会主义事业的利益完全符合的。
    苏南谈判的结果，我们两国良好关系遭到破坏的时期结束了。十分明显，我们两国关系遭到这样破坏只对帝国主义反动和侵略势力有利，因为它们竭力唆使各国人民互相冲突，在他们之间挑拨离间，以便于实现它们的反人民的阴险图谋。
    今天我们已经可以说，苏联和所有人民民主国家同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国建立和发展友好关系的道路已经打开了。我们在南斯拉夫期间曾经同南斯拉夫政府和共产主义者联盟的领导人交谈过，同南斯拉夫共和国总统铁托同志交谈过。我们参观了南斯拉夫的许多地区，同劳动者谈了话，并且我们看到，虽然南斯拉夫由于它同我们各国之间的关系受到破坏而遭受了种种困难，但是南斯拉夫没有放弃自己的主权，在帝国主义阵营的面前完全保持了它的国家独立。
    由于会谈的结果而产生了一种健康的、正常的状况，为进一步发展南斯拉夫和苏联的友好关系和各方面的合作扫清了道路。
    苏联和南斯拉夫关系的改善是对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平事业的一个新的贡献。毫无疑问：苏南会谈将服务于所有爱好和平的各国人民的利益和各国劳动人民的利益，他们以赞同的心情迎接关于苏南会谈良好结果的消息。苏联和人民民主国家的人民以特别满意的心情欢迎苏南会谈的结果，因为这些国家的人民在很多年以来由于为了共同事业而进行的联合斗争而同南斯拉夫人民联系在一起了。
    苏联和保加利亚人民共和国始终不渝地、坚定不移地执行和平政策，为缓和国际紧张局势而斗争。同我们一起捍卫着这种符合各国人民的利益的政策的有伟大的中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家以及全体爱好和平的人民。我们强大的社会主义阵营的力量以及我们对于反动侵略集团的任何阴谋决不能阻碍我们前进的这种信心，一天比一天增长和加强。
    这个阵营里的每个国家都对我们的共同事业作出贡献。光荣的保加利亚人民对争取和平的事业和加强社会主义阵地的事业作了相当的贡献。我们各国劳动人民的工作做得越好，和平事业和社会主义事业就越巩固！同志们！我们要奋不顾身地为这个伟大事业的胜利而劳动！
    契尔文科夫和赫鲁晓夫的讲话受到了到会者的热烈欢迎，一再被暴风雨般经久不息的掌声和欢呼声所打断。
