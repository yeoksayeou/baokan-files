How Agricultural Cooperatives Adopt the Method of Renting Cattle
—A Record of a Forum of Members of an Agricultural Cooperative in Wutang Township, Yongning County

At the current stage, it is better for agricultural production cooperatives to adopt the method of private ownership and renting of draft animals. This is the conclusion reached at a recent forum of members of the Wutang Township Agricultural Cooperative in Yongning County, Guangxi Province, on the issue of draft animals joining the cooperative. Participants in the forum included veteran and new cooperative members, cooperative committee members and general members, and poor and middle peasant members. They discussed the following questions:

What are the advantages of adopting the method of private ownership and renting of draft animals?

Members of the "Lianxing" Agricultural Cooperative (the old cooperative) said: It is difficult for the cooperative if draft animals are not brought into the cooperative; however, there are also many practical difficulties in bringing draft animals into the cooperative. After the draft animals belong to the cooperative, everyone thinks that since the capital is guaranteed, even if they die, "everyone will bear the burden," so they don't take care of them wholeheartedly. Since this spring, six of the cooperative's thirty-three cattle have died. One member was responsible for feeding a cow. When the cow didn't return after dark, the cooperative director urged him to look for it, but he didn't go. A few days later, a chicken was missing from his house, but the whole family lit lamps to look for it. A new cooperative member said: "It is difficult to evaluate the value of draft animals when they join the cooperative, and it is also difficult to feed them. Members with cattle always want to evaluate their cattle at a higher price, and there are many opinions. Our cooperative specifically assigns two laborers to take care of the cattle (grazing), giving 200 catties of grain per year for taking care of one cow; even so, it is not well managed. Of the thirteen cattle in the cooperative, only nine can be used now." A middle peasant member said: "When I fed the cattle myself, I fed them plump and fat; now that the cooperative feeds them, they are so thin that their skin is wrapped around their bones. It hurts to see them, and sometimes I have to add some rice water to feed them myself." A poor peasant member said: After the draft animals joined the cooperative, the cattle were thin and weak and could not be used during the spring plowing. If they die, the capital must be guaranteed, and if they don't die, interest must be paid, and we suffer in vain. In the end, everyone agreed that although it is good to bring draft animals into the cooperative in the long run, there are many practical problems that cannot be solved at present, so it is not good. In the first few years of running the cooperative, it is better not to bring draft animals into the cooperative, but to adopt the method of renting, with private ownership and private feeding by the members, which can better promote the members' sense of responsibility to care for draft animals, which is beneficial to production and the consolidation of the agricultural cooperative.

When adopting the rental method, how should rent be paid?

Some members advocated classifying the cattle and stipulating the annual rent grain according to different conditions and paying the rent annually. However, some people said: "If we do this, everyone will want to use their own cattle less and use other people's cattle more; anyway, their own cattle can still get rent even if they are not used." After discussion, everyone believed that a principle must be followed: those who use the cattle more should get more rent grain, and those who use the cattle less should get less rent grain.

How should the accounts be calculated specifically? Everyone put forward two methods: one is to record the accounts by the piece; the other is to record the accounts by "chao" (here, it is customary to use cattle only one morning a day, which is called one "chao"). Members of the old cooperative said: It is more reasonable to record by the piece. Members of the new cooperative said: This is too complicated and brain-racking. Later, someone suggested: "Generally, it is still recorded by 'chao', stipulating how much rent grain is given for one 'chao'; if the old cooperative is indeed confident, it can also try recording by the piece and stipulating the rent grain by the piece." Everyone agreed with this opinion.

When recording accounts, is it better to record "points" or grain? Initially, many people said: Record how many "chao" are done and record how many "points", and divide the dividends together with the "work points" earned by people, which is simple and easy to remember. Later, they thought: If a few "points" are stipulated for one "chao", wouldn't the cooperative's production increase, and the cattle rent would also increase unreasonably? In the end, everyone believed that it is better to stipulate how many catties of grain are given for doing one "chao".

After adopting the rental method, how should the cattle be fed and taken care of?

Some middle peasant members said: "Since the cooperative uses the cattle, of course, we feed the cattle, and the cooperative takes care of the cattle (grazing)." Some poor peasant members asked: "The owner of the cattle gets grain for using the cattle to work, so why should the cooperative take care of it?" The middle peasant members laughed. After discussion, everyone agreed that it is best to have private ownership, private feeding, and private care. Everyone proposed: The problem of feeding the cattle is not big. After changing to private ownership, the owner will not be willing to let the cattle go to work if they are not fed well; however, taking care of the cattle is very troublesome. After repeated research, two methods were found: one is that the owners of the cattle reasonably jointly bear the cost of hiring someone to take care of the cattle; the other is that the owners of the cattle organize themselves and take turns taking care of the cattle. When implementing the rotation method, the cattle owners should be given due consideration, such as if it is which cattle owner's turn to take care of the cattle, the cooperative will no longer assign him work.

Later, a middle peasant member raised another question: "What if the cattle die?" Everyone discussed it endlessly. Some said: "Since the cattle are rented, of course, the owner is responsible." Some said: "The cooperative uses the cattle, of course, the cooperative is responsible." Someone asked again: "Isn't the cooperative responsible again becoming 'guaranteed capital'?" After analyzing the situation: Cattle die mostly from slowly becoming thin, which has a lot to do with whether they are well fed. If they are well fed, they will not die even if they are used many times. If they die suddenly, some are from epidemics, and some are from falling and fighting. The responsibility is clear, and there is no dispute. The responsibility can be distinguished and dealt with separately. The specific method is: If the cattle die from being poorly fed and becoming thin, the owner is responsible; if the cooperative rushes to work and the feeding is not appropriate at the same time, the owner and the cooperative are jointly responsible, and the burden is shared fairly according to the actual situation and the degree of responsibility; if they die suddenly, the responsibility should be investigated, and whoever is responsible should bear the responsibility.

After adopting the rental method, how should the cattle be used?

Everyone agreed that the cooperative should use them in a unified manner, giving priority to the public and then to the private, and taking care of individuals.

However, members with cattle also raised the question: "In order to get more work points, the members drive and beat the cattle hard when using them, and the cattle suffer too much." Everyone felt that it was natural for the cattle owners to have this concern. Some members suggested evaluating the "cultivation quota" of each draft animal: how much work is generally done when a cow is used for what work, and the cooperative and the owner should evaluate a fixed number. No matter who uses the cow, they cannot exceed this fixed number. Everyone agreed.

Will this cause disputes among cattle owners who all want to use their own cattle more? Everyone believed that there may be disputes because of the seasonal differences between busy and slack seasons. The following method can be adopted: the cattle are organized into teams and used in rotation during general periods. When there is a special need, the cooperative selects them starting from doing a good job in the cooperative's production.

A cooperative committee member raised another question: "After the draft animals are changed to private ownership, the current reasonable allocation of various teams and groups is disrupted. The owners of good cattle are willing to keep them for themselves or for their own team or group to use. How should this be handled?" After a debate, the common opinion obtained was: After the draft animals are changed to private ownership, the original reasonable allocation of various teams or groups cannot be disrupted. If the draft animals have already been uniformly allocated to which team or group by the cooperative before being changed to private ownership, they will still be used by that team or group. If individual cattle owners and the team or group using their cattle live too far apart or have other special reasons that make it inconvenient to feed them, individual adjustments can be made.

What special problems need to be solved when the method of discounting the price for returning to the cooperative to guarantee capital and pay interest is changed to private ownership and renting?

There are two special problems raised by everyone: First, the cattle are very thin now, and the owners must be unwilling to take them back. If a cow is evaluated at thirty-six yuan, but now it is so thin that only the skin is left, worth at most more than ten yuan, the owner will certainly not want it. Second, for the cattle that have been returned to the cooperative and have already died, should the capital still be guaranteed and interest paid?

Regarding the first question, everyone considered that if the cooperative gives the cattle owners some subsidies, it will increase the cooperative's burden. It is best to concentrate for another half a month to a month, with the cooperative responsible for adding feed and sending special personnel to feed them in the mountains, fattening them up and then returning them to the owners.

Regarding the second question, everyone believed that of course the capital should be guaranteed and compensated for those who have died; before the compensation, interest should still be paid according to the price.

After the forum solved these problems, the people present were in a good mood. Some members reflected: "In the past, our cooperative had cattle that died, and I was worried that it would be difficult to increase production this year. If they died again, I was afraid that we would lose money. Now that this method has been changed, the worries I originally had have been relieved."

    农业合作社怎样采取租用耕牛的办法
    ——记邕宁县五塘乡农业合作社的一个社员座谈会
    季桂明
    目前时期农业生产合作社对耕畜还是以采取私有租用的办法为好，这是最近广西省邕宁县五塘乡农业合作社社员座谈耕牛入社问题得到的结论。参加这个座谈会的有老社社员和新社社员，有社务委员和一般社员，有贫农社员和中农社员。他们座谈了以下几个问题：
    采取耕牛私有租用的办法有什么好处
    “联兴”农业合作社（老社）社员说：不把耕牛入社，社里是有困难的；但是，把耕牛入了社也有很多实际困难。把耕牛归社后，大家认为反正保了本，死掉也是“天塌众人顶”，就不用心照顾；今春以来，全社三十三头牛就死了六头。有一个社员负责喂养一头牛，天黑了牛没有回来，社长催他去找，他不去；过几天后他家不见了一只小鸡，却全家点灯去找。一个新社社员说：“耕牛入社评价难，喂养也难。有牛的社员总是想把自己的牛价评高些，意见很多。我们社专派两个劳动力包工看牛（放牛），看一头牛一年给二百斤谷；就这样，也管理不好。全社十三头牛，现在只剩九头能用的。”一个中农社员说：“我自己喂牛时，喂得肥呶呶；现在社里喂，瘦的皮包骨，看了心痛，有时我自己还要白搭一些饭水喂。”贫农社员说：把耕牛入社以后，牛又瘦又软，春耕时不能用，死了要保本，不死也要付息，我们干吃亏。最后，大家一致的意见是：虽然从长远看把耕牛入社好，但是目前有许多实际问题不能解决，就不好。社初办的几年里，不把耕牛入社，而采取租用的办法，由社员私有私养，可以更好地发扬社员爱护耕牛的责任心，对生产和农业合作社的巩固都有利。
    采取租用的办法时，怎样付租
    有些社员主张把牛分类，分别不同情况，规定一年的租谷，按年付租。可是，有人说：“这样做，谁都想少用自己的牛，多用别人的牛；反正自己的牛不用也可以照样得租。”经过讨论，大家认为：一定要遵守一条原则：使用得多的多得租谷，使用得少的少得租谷。
    怎样具体算账呢？大家提出了两个办法：一个是按件记账；一个是按“朝”（这里习惯每天用牛只能用一个早晨，叫做一“朝”）记账。老社社员说：按件记才合理。新社社员说：这样太复杂，伤脑筋。以后，有人提出：“一般还是按‘朝’记，规定一‘朝’好多租谷；如果老社确有把握，也可以试试按件记，按件规定租谷。”大家一致同意这个意见。
    记账时记“分”好还是记谷子好？最初，很多人说：做多少“朝”，记多少“分”，和人做的“工分”一起分红，省事又好记。以后又想到：如果规定了一“朝”几“分”，社增了产，岂不是“水涨船高”，牛租也要不合理地提高了？最后，大家认为：还是规定做一“朝”给几斤谷好。
    采取租用办法后，怎样喂牛看牛
    有的中农社员说：“既然是社里用，当然是我们喂牛，社里看牛（放牛）。”有的贫农社员就问：“用牛做工牛主得谷子，为什么要社里看它？”中农社员笑了。经过讨论，大家一致认为最好是私有、私喂、私看。大家提出：喂牛的问题不大，改成私有以后，不喂得饱饱的牛主也舍不得让牛出工；但是，看牛却很麻烦。反复研究，找出了两个办法：一个是牛主们合理地共同负担，请人看牛；另一个是牛主组织起来，轮流看牛。在实行轮流的办法时，要给牛主以应有的照顾，如轮到哪个牛主看牛，社里可不再给他派工。
    以后，一个中农社员又提出：“如果牛死了怎么办？”大家议论纷纭。有的说：“用牛给租，当然牛主自己负责。”有的说：“用牛是社里用，当然由社负责。”有人又问：“由社负责不是又成了
  ‘保本’了吗？”分析了情况：牛死多是慢慢消瘦死亡，这就和喂得好不好有很大关系。喂得好，虽然多用几次，也死不了。如果是突然死亡，有的是发瘟，有的是跌交打架，责任很明显，没有什么争执，可以分清责任，分别处理。具体办法是：因为喂不好，牛瘦死的，牛主负责；因为社里赶工，同时喂养的也不合适，牛主和社里共同负责，据实分别轻重，公议负担；突然死亡的，查明责任，是谁的责任就由谁负担。
    采取租用办法后，怎样用牛
    大家一致的意见是：由社统一使用，先公后私，照顾个人。
    但是，有牛的社员又提出：“为了多得工分，社员们用牛时猛赶猛打，牛太吃亏。”大家觉得：牛主有这个顾虑是很自然的。有的社员建议评定每头耕牛的“耕作定额”：用一头牛做什么工作时一般做多少，由社方和牛主评个定数，无论是谁用牛，都不能超过这个定数。大家都同意了。
    这样做，会不会发生牛主都要求多用自己的牛的争执？大家认为：因为有农忙农闲的季节差别，可能有争执。可以采用这样的办法：把牛编队，一般时期轮流使用，特别需要的时候从搞好社的生产出发，由社选用。
    一个社务委员又提出：“耕牛改成私有后，打乱了现在各队、组的合理搭配，有好牛的牛主，都愿留给自己或自己队、自己组使用，怎么处理？”争论了一通以后，得到的共同意见是：耕牛改成私有，不能打乱原来各队或组的合理搭配。耕牛在改成私有前已经由社统一搭配到哪个队或组的，就仍由哪个队或组使用。如果个别牛主和使用他的牛的队或组居住距离太远或有其他特殊原因不便于喂养可以个别调整。
    以前采用了折价归社保本付息办法，现在改成私有租用，需要解决什么特殊问题
    大家提出的特殊问题有两个：第一、现在牛很瘦，牛主一定不愿收回。如一头牛评价三十六元，现在瘦得只剩了一张皮，最多只值十多元，牛主当然不肯要。第二、归社的牛已经死了的，是否还要保本付息？
    对第一个问题，大家考虑到：如果由社给牛主一些补助，就会加重社的负担，最好再集中半个月到一个月的时间，由社负责加料，派专人放到山里喂养，养肥了再交还牛主。
    对第二个问题，大家认为：死了的当然要保本赔偿；在赔偿之前，仍应照价付息。
    座谈会解决了这些问题之后，到会的人情绪很好。有的社员反映：“以前我们社死了牛，我耽心今年难增产了，如果再死，还怕要亏本。现在改成这个办法，我原来挂着的心放下了。”
