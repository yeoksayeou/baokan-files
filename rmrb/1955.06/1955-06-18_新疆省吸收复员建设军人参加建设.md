Xinjiang Province Absorbs Demobilized Construction Soldiers to Participate in Construction

This May, the Xinjiang Provincial Department of Transportation recruited a total of 409 demobilized construction soldiers, including truck drivers and mechanics, from Shandong and Henan provinces to participate in the construction of the motherland's frontier. The selected personnel have now arrived at their new work posts in batches.

Prior to the recruitment, in April, the Xinjiang Provincial Department of Transportation contacted the Ministry of Internal Affairs to understand the distribution of truck drivers and mechanics among the demobilized construction soldiers, and sent people to Shandong and Henan provinces to recruit them. During the recruitment, the Shandong and Henan Provincial Civil Affairs Departments, Transportation Departments, and Transfer and Construction Committees provided great assistance, and selected a group of staff to form truck driver training classes to provide further training for the demobilized construction soldiers who applied.

When the recruited demobilized construction soldiers departed, Shandong and Henan provinces held farewell rallies. The负责人 (unclear title) of the Provincial Civil Affairs Department encouraged the demobilized construction soldiers at the meeting to carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army and actively contribute to the construction of the motherland's frontier. The demobilized construction soldiers felt a great honor to be able to participate in the construction of the motherland's frontier and expressed that they would strive to make contributions to the people in their new work posts.

    新疆省吸收复员建设军人参加建设
    新疆省交通厅今年五月份分别在山东、河南两省吸收了复员建设军人中的汽车司机和修理工共四百零九人参加祖国边疆建设工作。录取人员现已分批到达了新的工作岗位。
    在招收以前，四月间，新疆省交通厅和内务部取得联系，了解了复员建设军人中的汽车司机和修理工分布情况，派人分别到山东、河南两省进行招收。在招收中，山东、河南两省民政厅、交通厅和转业建设委员会等单位曾予以大力协助，抽调了一批工作人员组成汽车驾驶员训练班，对报考的复员建设军人作了进一步的训练。
    被录取的复员建设军人出发时，山东、河南两省都举行了欢送大会。省民政厅负责人在会上勉励复员建设军人发扬人民解放军的光荣传统，积极为祖国的边疆建设贡献力量。复员建设军人对于自己能够参加建设祖国边疆的工作感到很大的光荣，纷纷表示一定争取在新的工作岗位上为人民立功。
