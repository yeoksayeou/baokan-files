Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:

	I am very pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words at this meeting. This is a solemn occasion, as it is a gathering held by the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association and the Sino-Indian Friendship Association to celebrate the first anniversary of the joint statement by the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India, and the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma.

	As is well known, the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association was established on May 11, 1952, to further develop the good relations between the two countries. A pleasant coincidence was that the then Minister of Culture of Burma, who led the first Burmese cultural delegation to the People's Republic of China, attended the founding meeting of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association in Beijing at that time. Since its establishment, the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association has been extremely concerned with promoting friendship and mutual understanding between the two countries and has played an active role. The association expressed the will of the Chinese people to inject new life into the traditional friendship between the two countries that has existed since ancient times. This friendship had been somewhat lifeless when both countries were under imperialist control. The relationship between our two countries is built on the solid foundation of historical facts. There are many similarities between the two countries in terms of race and geography. Due to these similarities, since ancient times, before the opening of modern and overseas maritime transportation, there have been commercial and cultural exchanges between the two countries. Through land trade, China supplied Burma with some necessities, and similarly, Burma supplied China with some necessities. Following trade relations came cultural exchange.

	There is another historical factor that has had a significant impact on the relationship between the two countries, and due to this factor, Burma has played a historical role in this part of the world. This is Buddhism. Although Buddhism spread throughout China through the historical process, passing through Central Asia via the famous "Silk Road," Burma also played a role in the spread of Buddhism in southern China. Burma has been able to play a major role in Asian history because it is geographically located between the two major centers of Eastern culture—India and China. Because of its connections with China in the north and India in the south, it forms a bridge between two great cultures. A nation that has absorbed two cultures over a long historical period will inevitably become a bridge between the two cultures. This is a natural historical process. This process is even more evident today. Politically, due to colonialism, the relationship between Burma and India has become closer, and after liberation, the relationship between Burma and the Chinese people has also deepened. Therefore, throughout Southeast Asia, Burma is a meeting point for the economic and cultural aspects of the Chinese and Indian peoples.

	Based on this historical background of the exchanges between Burma, China, and India, we can understand the great consistency of the goals of these three countries in the current historical stage. This background illustrates the consistency of these countries' aspirations for world fraternity and peace. When we consider that the populations of these three countries, together with the populations of the other Asian and African countries that participated in the Bandung Asian-African Conference in April of this year, account for more than half of the world's population, we feel that their will to strive for peace should extend to the entire world that truly believes in the democratic principles of life.

	If the world denies this principle, it must face the prospect of a war using new weapons that can completely destroy humanity, because if we look at the history of war, we will find that in early human societies, wars were conducted solely by representatives of the societies. In those wars, the defeated party only lost one person. Later, until the First World War, military science had developed warfare into line-to-line combat. In those wars, the consequences were only related to a group of military personnel. And in modern times, as in the Second World War, the war was conducted on a plane, and not only the people on the front lines but also the civilians in the rear suffered the terrible consequences of the war. If the next war comes, it will be on the largest scale, because it will be fought by two strong camps in the world.

	Regarding this point, Mr. Chairman, let us look at how unfortunate a new world war would be. Recent epoch-making scientific discoveries, such as atomic energy and nuclear energy, if used properly, can bring infinite benefits to mankind, but if this energy is used incorrectly, it can cause the destruction of all mankind. So the question is not what progress modern science has made, but how mankind itself decides to use these profound discoveries. This is very important. It is strange that when mankind still has many enemies in nature to fight against, it uses scientific inventions to destroy its own kind. If mankind can use modern scientific knowledge to conquer the enemies of nature, then we will be healthier and happier, and there will be a better world. For achievements in this regard, it is necessary to rely on the clear and active expression of the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world. They want these great scientific discoveries to be used only to improve human life and not to destroy mankind. For this, we need world peace, and peace-loving people all over the world have already expressed their desire for peace in the solid form of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence published by the Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma.

	In some countries, these five principles are called "Panchsheel." In Burma, "Panchsheel" means: the five precepts that everyone needs to follow in their daily lives. These five principles are: 1. Mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty; 2. Mutual non-aggression; 3. Mutual non-interference in internal affairs; 4. Equality and mutual benefit; 5. Peaceful coexistence. These five principles can be applied to interpersonal and even international relations. If all mankind observes these five principles, there will be no more personal and international conflicts in the future.

	Unfortunately, due to mutual fear, distrust, and fanatical arms expansion, there is a trend in the world that could lead to a global war. Some philosophers say that the last war will occur between the "East" and the "West." But we do not believe that this war is inevitable. One thing is certain, no matter who the belligerents are, no matter which side wins, all of mankind will suffer the terrible consequences of the war. We have had the worst experience of the last world war. This war swept across our country twice from south to north and from north to south. These terrible memories are still fresh in our minds. So we are very happy to see some relaxation of tensions. And these phenomena are the result of the efforts of the great leaders of many countries. Peace-loving people all over the world should faithfully follow the path opened up by many great leaders.

	The Burmese people, with religion as their life background, hate any form of destruction of life. We firmly believe that if mankind can live according to the principle of "eternal love" and according to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, there will be no war again, and on the contrary, a happy and prosperous world will appear. Specifically, the world is a large family of many countries. Here, each country is a member of the family, with its own views and consciousness that may be different from others. But as the Burmese proverb says: "Even your own five fingers are different in size and length, but they can still exist and cooperate for the benefit of your entire system," then why can't the members of the world family coexist peacefully and strive for the improvement of the life of the entire human society?

	Finally, Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I pray that this specific and effective formula—the Five Principles of Coexistence—that guides the relationship between the members of the world family in order to live peacefully and prosperously, can expand its field as time goes on.

### 缅甸驻我国大使吴拉茂的讲话

1955-06-28

专栏：

    缅甸驻我国大使吴拉茂的讲话主席先生，各位女士，各位先生：
    我有机会在这个大会上讲几句话，感觉非常愉快。这是一个隆重的仪式，因为这是中缅友好协会和中印友好协会为了庆祝中华人民共和国和印度共和国两国总理和中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦两国总理的联合声明的一周年而召开的集会。
    如所周知，中缅友好协会于一九五二年五月十一日成立，以便进一步发展两国间的良好关系。一个愉快的巧遇是：那时率领由缅甸前来中华人民共和国的第一个文化代表团的缅甸文化部部长当时在北京出席了中缅友好协会成立大会。中缅友好协会成立以后，就对促进两国间的友好和互相了解极为关心，并且起了积极作用。协会表达了中国人民的意志，即为自古以来存在着的两国间的传统友谊注入了新生命。这种友谊在两国都处在帝国主义控制下的时候一直多少是没有生命力的，我们两国间的关系是建立在历史事实的牢固的基础上的。两国之间在人种方面、地理方面有很多接近点。由于这种接近点，自古以来，在近代和海外的海上交通还未开辟之前，两国间就有了商务和文化的往来。通过陆地贸易，中国供给缅甸一些生活必需品，同样地，缅甸供给中国一些必需品。跟着贸易关系就有文化交流。
    还有一个对两国关系发生重大影响的历史因素，由于这个因素，缅甸在世界的这部分起了历史性的作用。这就是佛教。虽然佛教通过历史的过程，穿过中央亚细亚，由有名的“丝绸大道”传遍中国，在中国南部佛教的传播中，缅甸也起了作用。在亚洲历史中，缅甸所以能够起重大的作用，是因为她在地理上处在东方文化两大中心——印度和中国——之间。由于她在北方与中国往来，在南方和印度有关系，她构成两个伟大文化的桥梁。一个民族，如果在长久的历史年代里吸收了两种文化，它一定会成为两种文化的桥梁。这是自然的历史过程。这种过程在今天更为显明。在政治上，由于殖民主义，缅甸和印度的关系更加密切了，解放后，缅甸和中国人民的关系也加深了。因此在整个东南亚，缅甸是中印人民在经济文化方面的会合点。
    根据缅甸、中国及印度交往的这种历史背景，我们就可以了解，现在这一历史阶段中这三个国家的目的的伟大的一致性。这个背景说明了这些国家对世界博爱与和平的热望的一致性，当我们考虑到这三个国家的人口连本年四月参加万隆亚非会议的其他亚非国家的人口占全世界人口一半以上的时候，我们觉得他们争取和平的意志应普及到整个真正相信生活的民主原则的世界。
    如果世界否认这一原则，它就必须面临一场使用能彻底毁灭人类的新式武器的战争的前景，因为如果我们看一看战争的历史，我们将发现在早期人类社会里战争是单独由社会的代表们进行的，在那些战争里，战败的一方仅仅损失一人。以后直至第一次世界大战，军事科学已经使战争发展到线与线的战斗。在那种战争里，后果只是和一群军事人员有关。而在近代，像在第二次世界战争，战争是进行在平面上，不仅是前线的人，就是在后方的平民也遭受到战争的可怕的后果。下一次战争如果降临的话，将是最大规模的，因为将由世界上两个坚强的阵营作战。
    关于这一点，主席先生，让我们看一下新的世界战争将是多么不幸。近来一些划时代的科学发现，如原子能、核子能，如能正当地利用，可以为人类无限造福，但是如果错误地使用这种能量，可以引起全人类的毁灭。所以问题不在于近代科学已有了怎样的进步，而在于人类自己决定怎样地利用这种高深的发现，这是很有关系的。很奇怪的是当人类还有很多自然界的敌人作为斗争对象时，却去利用科学发明来毁灭自己的同类。如果人类能使用近代的科学知识去征服自然界的敌人，那末我们将更加健康更加快乐，将有一个更美好的世界。为了这方面的成就，是要依靠全世界爱好和平的人民清楚地积极地表示他们的愿望，他们要这些伟大的科学发现只用于提高人类的生活而不是为了毁灭人类。为了这点，我们需要世界和平，并且全世界爱好和平的人民已经在由中国、印度、缅甸总理们所发表的和平共处五项原则的坚固形式下表白了他们争取和平的愿望。
    在一些国家里，这五项原则被称为“班查西拉”。在缅甸，“班查西拉”的意思是：每一个人每天生活所需要遵守的五条格言。这五项原则是：一、互相尊重领土的完整和主权；二、互不侵犯；三、互不干涉内政；四、平等互利；五、和平共处。这五项原则可以应用于个人乃至于国际间互相关系。如果全人类都遵守这五项原则，将来是不会再有个人和国际间的冲突的。
    不幸得很，由于互相畏惧，互不信任以及狂热地扩张军备，在世界上有一种足以导致全球性战争的趋势。有些哲学家们说，最后一次战争将发生在“东方”与“西方”之间。但是我们不相信这场战争是不可避免的。有一件事情是肯定的，无论交战者是谁，无论那一方胜利，整个人类将遭受到战争的可怕的后果。我们受到过上一次世界大战的最坏的经验。这个战争从南到北，又从北到南地两次扫过我们的国家。在我们中间这些可怕的记忆犹新。所以我们很高兴看到紧张局势的某些缓和现象。而这些现象是由于许多国家的伟大领袖的努力的结果。全世界爱好和平的人民都应当忠实地走这条由许多伟大领袖所开辟出来的道路。
    以宗教为生活背景的缅甸人民憎恨任何形式的毁灭生命的事情。我们坚信，如果人类能按照“永爱”的原则并根据和平共处五大原则生存，再一次战争是不会有的，相反地，将出现愉快的升平世界。具体地说，世界就是许多国家的大家庭。在这里每一国是家庭的一员，有他自己的或许不同于别人的观点和意识。但是像缅甸谚语说：“即使你自己的五个手指，大小长短都不一样，但他们仍然能够为你整个系统的利益而存在与合作”，那末世界家庭的成员们为什么就不能和平共处并为整个人类社会的生活的改进而努力呢？
    最后，主席先生，各位女士，各位先生，我祈祷这个指导世界家庭各个成员之间的关系，以便和平而繁荣地生活的具体而有效的公式——五项共处原则能随时间的推移而扩大它的领域。
