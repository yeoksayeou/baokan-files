Overcoming One-Sided Views in Labor Education
Chen Dake

Labor education is one of the important components of communist education. The main tasks of labor education are: to cultivate students' socialist views on labor, to develop students' socialist labor attitudes, to instill labor habits in students, and to teach students basic knowledge and certain skills in industrial and agricultural production.

In the process of conducting labor education, organizing students to participate appropriately in physical labor is of great significance. Because through physical labor, especially participation in public service labor, not only can the habit of serving the people be cultivated, but also the development of physical, intellectual, and moral qualities can be promoted.

However, many teachers have made one-sided interpretations of this. Consequently, they have pitted education against labor and physical labor against intellectual labor. Some teachers, in order to implement labor education, talk about "production" at every turn and "labor" in every class, truly "production in the classroom, labor in every lesson." Some teachers, in order to mobilize students to engage in industrial and agricultural production, dare not talk about the issue of further education; they even ask students to publicly "swear" or express their attitude not to apply for higher-level schools. Some teachers, in order to emphasize physical labor, lead students to participate in arduous land reclamation, which inevitably affects students' learning mood, hinders the normal progress of school teaching, and even harms students' physical health. These practices are obviously very harmful.

Conducting labor education is to ultimately enable students to become well-rounded socialist new people. Therefore, labor education must be closely integrated with comprehensive development education and other contents of socialist political and ideological education. Labor education should first be integrated into the teaching of various subjects. The view that education is opposed to labor is wrong. Of course, this is not to say that students should not participate in physical labor appropriately. Lenin once pointed out: "Without combining the education of the younger generation with productive labor, the ideal of future socialism is unimaginable." However, organizing students to participate in physical labor must not only take into account the school's teaching tasks, but also the age of the students.

Labor includes both physical labor and intellectual labor, and the two are not contradictory but unified. Of course, in class society, physical labor and intellectual labor are opposed to each other; but in our country, due to the continuous development of socialist construction, the opposition between physical labor and intellectual labor will gradually disappear. Therefore, when conducting labor education for students, we should proceed from these principles. We should correctly understand the relationship between physical labor and intellectual labor, and should not be biased towards either. Only in this way can students obey the needs of the state after graduation, whether they go on to further education or participate in labor production. The view that opposes physical labor to intellectual labor and opposes participation in production to further education is neither in line with the requirements of national construction nor in line with the principles of teaching.

Correctly conducting labor education and vigorously overcoming one-sided views in teaching is a major task for educators at present.

    克服劳动教育中的片面观点
    陈大可
    劳动教育是共产主义教育的重要组成部分之一。劳动教育的主要任务是：培养学生具有社会主义的劳动观点，养成学生社会主义的劳动态度，使学生获得劳动的习惯，以及教给学生工农业生产的基本知识和一定技能。
    在进行劳动教育的过程中，组织学生适当地参加体力劳动是有其重大意义的。因为通过体力劳动，特别是参加公益劳动，不仅可以养成为人民服务的习惯，而且可以促进体力、智力和道德的发展。
    但是，有不少教师对此作了片面的认识。于是，他们就把教育同劳动、体力劳动同智力劳动对立起来。有的教师为了贯彻劳动教育，就开口谈“生产”，闭口谈“劳动”，真是所谓“堂堂生产，课课劳动”。有的教师为了动员学生从事工农业生产，就不敢谈升学问题；他们甚至要学生公开“宣誓”或表明态度不去投考高一级的学校。有的教师为了强调体力劳动，就带领学生参加繁重的开荒，结果势必影响了学生的学习情绪，妨碍了学校教导工作的正常进行，以至损害了学生的身体健康。这些做法显然都是十分有害的。
    进行劳动教育就是为了使学生最后成为全面发展的社会主义的新人。因此，劳动教育要同全面发展教育，同社会主义政治思想教育的其他内容紧密结合起来。劳动教育首先应该溶合到各科教学中去进行。那种把教育同劳动对立起来的观点是错误的。当然，这并不是说学生不应该适当地参加体力劳动。列宁曾经指出：“如果不把青年一代的教育同生产劳动结合起来，未来社会主义的理想是不可想像的。”但是，组织学生参加体力劳动，不仅必须考虑到学校的教导任务，并且必须考虑到学生的年龄。
    劳动包括体力劳动和智力劳动，二者不是矛盾而是统一的。固然在阶级社会中，体力劳动同智力劳动是互相对立的；但是在我们的国家中，由于社会主义建设的不断发展，体力劳动同智力劳动的对立必将逐渐消灭。因此，对学生进行劳动教育，就应该从这些道理出发。正确理解体力劳动同智力劳动的关系，而不可对任何一方有所偏废。只有这样，才能使学生在毕业后升学或者参加劳动生产，都能服从国家的需要。那种把体力劳动同智力劳动对立起来，把参加生产同升学对立起来的观点，是既不符合国家建设的要求，又不符合教学的原则的。
    正确进行劳动教育，大力克服教学中片面观点，这对于教育工作者说来乃是当前重大的任务。
