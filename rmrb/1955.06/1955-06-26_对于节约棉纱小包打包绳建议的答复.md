    Reply to Suggestions for Saving Cotton Yarn Packaging Rope for Small Packages
    Many readers have written with suggestions regarding saving cotton yarn packaging rope for small packages. We now present a comprehensive reply from the Ministry of Textile Industry regarding these suggestions:
    The use of cotton yarn rope for packaging is to ensure that the cotton yarn is not damaged or scattered during transportation. Hemp rope is hard and easily damages the fibers, and the current supply of hemp raw materials cannot meet the needs, so it is not suitable to use hemp rope as a substitute. Paper rope is too weak and easily breaks when exposed to moisture, which does not meet the packaging requirements. Currently, the cotton yarn rope used for packaging in general factories is made of substandard yarn or blended waste yarn produced during the spinning process, spun into sub-brand yarn. This yarn is generally not suitable for machine weaving. In order to save cotton yarn, the number of single yarns per packaging rope has been gradually reduced from the originally stipulated 35 strands of ten-count yarn to below 30 strands. As for the phenomenon of individual factories (including joint state-private or private factories) mixing some better cotton yarn or having an excessive number of strands in the packaging rope, this should be corrected.
    Some readers have suggested changing the four packaging ropes to three. This method was piloted in the Yingkou Textile Factory in the Northeast region as early as 1954, and the Shanghai State-owned Third Cotton Textile Factory also conducted experiments and is preparing for comprehensive promotion.
    Some readers have suggested that used cotton yarn packaging rope be collected and reused. Because cotton yarn rope is not easy to collect and concentrate after being scattered, and the processing and transportation costs are high, this is not cost-effective.

### 对于节约棉纱小包打包绳建议的答复

    对于节约棉纱小包打包绳建议的答复
    很多读者来信提出有关节约棉纱小包打包绳的建议，现请纺织工业部对这些建议综合答复如下：
    采用棉纱绳打包是为了保证棉纱在运输过程中不致磨损和散包。麻绳质硬，容易磨伤纤维，而且目前麻的原料供应不能满足需要，因此不宜用麻绳作代用品。纸绳强力太小，受了潮湿容易脱断，不合于打包要求。目前一般工厂打包的棉纱绳，都是用纺纱过程中产生的少量坏纱或合用下脚花纱纺的副牌纱制成的。这些纱一般都不宜于机织使用。为了节约棉纱，每根打包绳的单纱根数已由原规定的十支纱三十五根陆续减少到三十根以下。至于个别工厂（包括公私合营或私营工厂）在打包绳中混用部分较好的棉纱或有根数过多的现象，这是应该纠正的。
    有些读者建议将四道打包绳改为三道。这个办法早于一九五四年在东北地区营口纺织厂试行，上海国营第三棉纺织厂也进行了试验，将准备全面推广。
    有些读者来信建议将用过的棉纱打包绳收回再用。由于棉纱绳分散后不易收回集中，而且付出的加工整理费及运输费用很多，这样做是不合算的。
