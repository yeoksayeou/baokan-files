    Shandong farmers at all levels of Party and government organs are actively guiding farmers to study various effective measures to increase production in their local areas, striving to overproduce 1.5 billion catties of grain in the autumn harvest. By mid-June, according to statistics from ten special districts (lacking Wendeng Special District) and Zibo City, plans have been made to increase the planting of high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes by more than 3.42 million mu, and corn by 3.15 million mu. Plans have also been made to increase the planting of late millet, dry rice, potatoes and other crops. In counties such as Junan, Fei, Pingyi, Yishui, and Tancheng, more than 333,000 mu of corn, potatoes, and other crops have been added. Huimin Special District has planted more than 300,000 mu of sweet potatoes. In Huantai County, which has better water conservancy conditions in the district, 200,000 mu of corn and millet have also been interplanted in wheat fields. (Zhang Gong)
