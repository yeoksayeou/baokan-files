Xinhua News Agency, June 9th: The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a symposium on the 8th to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. The symposium was presided over by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, and discussions were conducted in three groups. Speakers unanimously expressed boundless anger at the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's criminal activities, demanding the immediate removal of Hu Feng from all his positions and the revocation of his qualification as a deputy to the National People's Congress, and that he be severely punished according to the law. Many speakers believed that the Hu Feng clique was a thorough-going counter-revolutionary group and must be thoroughly investigated. Those present further recognized the complexity and acuteness of the class struggle during the transition period from the exposed facts of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and expressed that they would always be vigilant and strictly draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves. The symposium will continue to further analyze the harmfulness of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and deeply expose the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: The headquarters of the China Democratic League and the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party held symposiums on the 7th to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. The symposium at the headquarters of the China Democratic League was presided over by Shen Junru, Acting Chairman of the China Democratic League. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that members of the China Democratic League should raise their vigilance, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and expose the various crimes of the Hu Feng clique. In particular, Hu Feng elements have been discovered within the League. Therefore, local organizations of the China Democratic League should encourage members of the China Democratic League to join the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and assist the government in eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

The symposium held by the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party was presided over by Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party. Speakers unanimously believed that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was the most insidious and vicious enemy, an organized, programmatic, and tactical group that, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, attempted to undermine the people's revolutionary cause from within. They expressed their full support for the resolution of the joint enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the China Writers Association, removing Hu Feng from all his positions and handing him over to the court for severe punishment according to the law.

Xinhua News Agency, June 9th: On the 8th, the Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the All-China Federation Of Trade And Industry, the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly held a symposium to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. During the symposium, those present unanimously believed that the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a serious political struggle currently taking place in the country. All industrialists and businessmen should participate in this struggle, widely study relevant documents, hold symposiums and report meetings, and carry out exposure and criticism.

Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: The Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the Central Standing Committee of the Jiusan Society, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have respectively notified their subordinate local organizations, calling on members to participate in the struggle to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

Xinhua News Agency, June 7th: The Cultural Group and Study Forum of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference jointly held a symposium on June 7th to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. More than 200 people participated, including Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee. Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, was invited to attend the symposium.

At the meeting, Chen Shutong, Zheng Yun, Shao Lizi, Chen Qiyuan, Wang Yunsheng, Chen Qitong, Huang Shaohong, Da Punsheng, Xu Guangping, Liang Shuming and others spoke successively. Zhou Yang delivered a central speech. Ye Gongchuo, Gu Jiegang, Hu Shuhua and others expressed their opinions in writing. They unanimously believed that the Hu Feng clique, wearing the cloak of Marxism, has long and consistently engaged in anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary criminal activities, and has finally been exposed. This is another major victory for the socialist revolution led by the Communist Party of China. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed with the decision of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the China Writers Association, demanding the removal of Hu Feng from his various positions and the revocation of his qualification as a deputy to the National People's Congress, thoroughly investigating the political background of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and suppressing their counter-revolutionary activities.
