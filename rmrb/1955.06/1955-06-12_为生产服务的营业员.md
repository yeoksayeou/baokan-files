    A Shop Assistant Serving Production
    Yao Xianhua
    Fu Hanyun, a shop assistant at the No. 18 Township Branch of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Bijie County, Guizhou Province, is a Communist Party member.

    During this year's spring plowing season, the area experienced a drought. Farmers lacked drought-resistant tools and were very anxious. The branch had three dragon-bone waterwheels, but the farmers had never used them and were unwilling to buy them. Fu Hanyun then demonstrated the waterwheels to the farmers. The first time, because the parts of the waterwheel were not properly installed, not much water came out, and Fu Hanyun's foot was also injured. But he was not discouraged. He carefully checked every part of the waterwheel, found the problem, and sent it to the district to be repaired. When he tried it again the second time, the waterwheel worked very well, and the farmers believed in the effectiveness of the waterwheel. The three dragon-bone waterwheels in the branch were quickly bought by the farmers and put into the fight against the drought in a timely manner.

    Fu Hanyun is the only shop assistant in this branch. During the day, he is busy with sales, and in the evening, he often goes to nearby agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers' homes to understand their needs. Sometimes, he also promotes the Party's policies in response to the farmers' thinking. Once, he learned that some local farmers lacked miscellaneous grain seeds, and some farmers who had seeds wanted to take the opportunity to raise prices. Fu Hanyun then promoted to the farmers who had seeds the principle of equal exchange, with no one suffering losses, and exchanged the seeds to others, explaining that everyone would benefit from increased production. As a result, he helped farmers adjust 210 jin of miscellaneous grain seeds in this way. In 1954, some of the agricultural tools of the supply and marketing cooperative did not meet the requirements of the farmers and were overstocked. Fu Hanyun solicited the opinions of the masses and reported them to the higher authorities, and processed those rakes and hoes that were roughly and heavily made according to the styles requested by the masses. This year's newly manufactured agricultural tools are also loved by the masses, and there are no more overstocked items.

    Fu Hanyun's work has been praised by the masses. The sales volume of the No. 18 Township Branch has been increasing continuously. The sales task for the second quarter was completed by about half in the first 19 days. At the end of February this year, Fu Hanyun was selected as the county's second-class model worker.

    为生产服务的营业员
    姚显华
    贵州省毕节县供销合作社第十八乡分销店的营业员傅汉云是一个共产党员。
    今年春耕生产期间，这一带发生了干旱。农民缺少抗旱工具，心里都很着急。分销店里有三部龙骨水车，可是农民没有使用过，都不愿意买。傅汉云便用龙骨水车车水表演给农民看。第一次因为龙骨水车的零件没安好，没有车出多少水来，傅汉云的脚也被打伤了。但是他没有灰心，详细地检查了水车的每一部分，找出毛病，送到区里找人修理好。当第二次试验的时候，车水情况很好，农民们相信龙骨水车的作用了。分销店里的三部龙骨水车很快就被农民买去，及时投入了抗旱斗争。
    这个分销店里只有傅汉云一个营业员。白天忙着营业，晚上他还常到附近农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民家中去了解他们的需要。有时候，他还针对农民的思想情况宣传党的政策。有一次，他了解到当地有些农民缺少杂粮种籽，有的有种籽的农民想乘机抬高价钱。傅汉云便向有种籽的农民宣传等价交换，互不吃亏，把种籽换给别人，增产以后大家都有好处的道理。结果他就这样帮助农民调剂了二百一十斤杂粮种籽。一九五四年，供销合作社有一部分农具不合农民的要求，被积压了下来。傅汉云征求了群众的意见，反映给上级，把那些打得又粗又重的耙和锄头，根据群众要求的式样进行了加工。今年新制的农具，也都为群众所喜爱，再没有一件积压了。
    傅汉云的工作受到了群众的赞扬。第十八乡分销店的营业额不断上升，第二季度的销售任务，在开头的十九天当中就完成了一半左右。今年二月底，傅汉云被评选为县的二等模范。
