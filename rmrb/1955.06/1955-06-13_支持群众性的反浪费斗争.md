    Support the Mass Anti-Waste Struggle
    Zhang Qian
    In order to accelerate the speed of our country's socialist industrialization and to accumulate more construction funds, we must launch a comprehensive conservation movement and resolutely oppose waste in all its forms. The current phenomenon of waste is quite widespread and serious. This urgently requires relying on the broad masses of the people to expose waste of state property from all sides and to resolutely fight against it; otherwise, the goal of eliminating waste cannot be achieved. The newspapers' major responsibility in this serious struggle is to mobilize more and more people to join the ranks of anti-waste, expose and gradually eliminate all wasteful phenomena. Past propaganda practice has proven that the more newspapers value the anti-waste enthusiasm of the masses, support them and closely rely on them to oppose waste, the more they can attract people to this struggle and form a powerful public opinion, thereby better exerting the combat role of the newspapers.

    The Liaoning Daily is a newspaper that pays attention to supporting the masses in carrying out the anti-waste struggle. It fully demonstrated this characteristic in its reports on the waste problem at the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Shenyang. At the end of February this year, in order to understand the waste of raw materials in the factory among the masses, the newspaper's editorial department held a symposium on anti-waste issues. At the meeting, several workers from the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory revealed the serious waste of steel and wood in their factory due to the one-sided pursuit of output value plans and chaotic management, and asked the newspaper to support their criticism. The newspaper attached great importance to the anti-waste demands of these workers and quickly published their manuscript, actively supporting their exposure and criticism. The Liaoning Daily did not only do this, it also sent people to the factory to reorganize the communication organization and organize the masses of workers to report situations, write letters and manuscripts. This effort to deeply reflect and promote the struggle greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses and strengthened the connection between the newspaper and the masses. In just a month and a half from March, a total of 24 people, including workers, material clerks, technicians, engineers, party branch secretaries, and propaganda officers from this factory, wrote 38 contributions and letters, and some people constantly called and came to talk in person. Relying on this mass work and organizational work, the newspaper further exposed the waste of raw materials, planning, and labor discipline in various workshops and departments. During the progress of the struggle, the Liaoning Daily also published a commentary titled "Anti-Waste Must Mobilize the Masses" based on the information reflected in the workers' letters and its own investigation, criticizing the "upper level moves, but the lower level doesn't" situation caused by the factory leaders' failure to pay attention to mobilizing the masses, and pointing out the ways to carry out the struggle. In order to ensure that the struggle developed on the right track, the newspaper also promptly published criticisms from the masses, and seriously criticized the erroneous attitudes and practices of some staff and workers in evading and coping with the struggle. Obviously, the Liaoning Daily focused on a major waste problem, supported and relied on the masses to conduct in-depth exposure and criticism, and enthusiastically provided practical help to the masses, which not only attracted the masses to participate in the criticism in the newspaper, but also encouraged them to actively participate in the struggle in their actual work. Undoubtedly, this should be an effective method for newspapers to promote the anti-waste struggle.

    However, just as anti-waste is a broad struggle, anti-waste propaganda in newspapers should also be multifaceted. It is necessary for newspapers to select major waste problems with typical significance, mobilize and organize the strength of the masses to carry out in-depth propaganda. But if newspapers are entangled in individual problems for a long time without attracting the masses from all sides to conduct effective struggle against major waste phenomena in all aspects, it will limit the anti-waste struggle to a narrow scope and weaken the role of newspapers in this struggle. The Liaoning Daily has paid attention to this point. During its support for the anti-waste struggle of the workers of the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, it also exposed and criticized other major waste problems. The problems exposed by the newspaper successively included the abandonment of large amounts of coal in mining areas, which reduced the coal extraction rate; the abandonment of large amounts of steel and iron materials in factories and enterprises; a factory producing waste and substandard products for a long time in order to make up for the production and total value of goods plans; the accumulation of large amounts of machinery, equipment and materials in the warehouses of industrial and mining enterprises; extravagance and waste in civil construction; a city building a luxurious cultural palace that could have been avoided; waste and losses in grain storage and consumption; a state-owned food company failing to actively improve its operations and formulating a money-losing plan; and the extravagance and waste of the Provincial Department of Industry in pursuing ostentation. It can be seen that these exposures in the newspaper covered all aspects including industrial production, basic construction, grain storage and consumption, state-owned commerce, and state organs. And the exposure of waste phenomena in industrial production included all aspects such as product quality, the use of raw materials, the storage of equipment and materials, planning, management systems, and labor discipline. Because waste is widespread, and the masses' demands for anti-waste are also rising, newspapers can launch and support the masses to expose and overcome waste phenomena from all aspects and links, so as to form a truly broad mass struggle against waste. When conducting some major criticisms, the Liaoning Daily, like supporting the workers of the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory to carry out criticism, also supported the masses and relied on the power of public opinion to deeply expand the effect of the criticism. For example, the criticism of the large-scale wheat pest infestation in Haicheng was based on a letter from a staff member of the Haicheng Grain Bureau. In addition to supporting this criticism, the newspaper also guided readers to continuously expose and criticize the bureaucracy and red tape of the Liaoning Provincial Grain Department. On the other hand, the newspaper also paid attention to using various forms such as commentaries, articles, cartoons, and the establishment of special columns to attract the masses to carry out criticism. All of these have made the content and form of anti-waste propaganda more rich and diverse, so that it can be developed on a broader mass basis.

    In order to achieve the goal of overcoming waste and improving work, the anti-waste propaganda in newspapers should never be just simple exposure, it should also commend advanced figures who insist on opposing waste, introduce good experiences in overcoming waste, and report on the new atmosphere emerging in the struggle, so as to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses to conduct the struggle from the positive and active aspects, so as to achieve the practical effect of the anti-waste struggle. In this regard, the Liaoning Daily has also had many reports. For example, the newspaper published communications and commentaries, praising Yang Yufang, a riveting and welding worker in the riveting and welding workshop of the First Machine Tool Factory, and calling on everyone to learn from his spirit of discovering waste phenomena from the small aspects of daily production activities and bravely and resolutely carrying out the struggle. In the course of launching the struggle of "saving grain and opposing wasteful behavior," the newspaper received a letter from a reader, suggesting the use of "oil felt base paper paving method" in the railway transportation of grain to transport loose grain such as corn and soybeans, so as to reduce losses and save expenses. The newspaper immediately sent reporters to conduct an on-site investigation, confirmed that this method was indeed very good, and published the reader's suggestion and the newspaper's investigation process in a prominent position, promoting this experience. The newspaper also published several letters from the masses reflecting the new atmosphere after the anti-waste struggle in the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory. In another communication titled "After the Anti-Waste Struggle," it once used specific facts and figures to illustrate the new look of the Liaodong Silk Weaving Factory after carrying out the anti-waste struggle. These reports that support the advanced, explain the methods, and reflect new things are an indispensable aspect of anti-waste propaganda.

    At present, many newspapers have paid attention to anti-waste propaganda. Some of these newspapers, due to the lack of extensive and close contact with the masses, and failing to pay attention to deeply mobilizing and organizing the masses, have produced fragmentary and non-penetrating shortcomings in their propaganda. They either expose everywhere without grasping major issues to conduct in-depth propaganda; or they are entangled in individual events for a long time without being able to attract and mobilize the masses from all sides to launch a struggle against various waste phenomena; or they do not pay attention to reporting on advanced figures, good experiences, and new atmospheres in the struggle. In this way, they have deviated from the requirements of actual life for newspapers and cannot truly achieve the practical effect of overcoming waste. This situation should be changed. In order to improve the anti-waste propaganda in newspapers, the Liaoning Daily's experience in supporting and relying on the masses to carry out in-depth anti-waste propaganda from all aspects can be used as a reference for us.

    支持群众性的反浪费斗争
    张浅
    为了加速我们国家社会主义工业化的速度，为了积累更多的建设资金，我们必须展开全面的节约运动，坚决反对各方面的浪费现象。目前的浪费现象是相当普遍而严重的。这就迫切需要依靠广大人民群众从各方面揭发浪费国家财产的行为，同它进行坚决的斗争；不如此就不能达到消灭浪费的目的。报纸在这一严重斗争中的重大责任，就是要动员愈来愈多的人民群众参加反浪费的行列，揭露和逐步消灭一切浪费现象。过去的宣传实践已经证明，报纸越是重视群众的反浪费热情，支持和紧密依靠他们反对浪费，就越能吸引人们到这个斗争中来，形成强大的舆论力量，从而更好地发挥报纸的战斗作用。
    辽宁日报就是注意支持群众开展反浪费斗争的一个报纸。它在关于沈阳皇姑屯机车车辆修理厂浪费问题的报道中，充分表现了这方面的特点。今年二月底，报纸编辑部为了在群众中了解工厂原材料的浪费情况，曾经召开了反浪费问题的座谈会。在会上，皇姑屯机车车辆修理厂的几个职工，揭露了他们工厂由于片面追求产值计划和管理混乱而造成的钢材木材的严重浪费现象，要求报纸支持他们的批评。报纸十分重视这几个职工的反浪费要求，很快地就登出了他们的稿件，积极支持了他们的揭发和批评。辽宁日报不只做了这些，它还派人去到工厂整顿了通讯组织，组织职工群众反映情况、写信写稿。这种为深入反映和推动斗争而做的努力，又大大鼓舞了群众的积极性，密切了报纸同群众的联系。仅自三月份起的一个半月间，这个工厂就有工人、材料员、技术员、工程师、党总支书记、宣传干事共二十四人写来了三十八件来稿来信，有的人并不断来电话，来面谈。报纸依靠着这种群众工作和组织工作，就进一步在报上揭露了各个车间、科室的原材料、制定计划和劳动纪律等各方面的浪费现象。在斗争进展过程中，辽宁日报还根据职工来信反映的情况和自己的调查，发表题为“反浪费必须发动群众”的评论，批评了工厂领导工作人员不注意发动群众而造成的“上动下不动”的情况，指出了开展斗争的途径。为了使斗争在正确轨道上发展，报纸并及时发表来自群众的批评，对部分工作人员和工人搪塞、应付斗争的错误态度和作法，进行了严肃的批判。很明显，辽宁日报针对一个重大的浪费问题，支持和依靠群众进行深入的揭发和批判，热情地给群众以实际的帮助，这就不仅吸引群众参加了报纸上的批评，而且鼓舞他们在实际工作中积极参加斗争。无疑地这应是报纸推动反浪费斗争的一种有效方法。
    但是正像反浪费是一个规模广阔的斗争一样，报纸上的反浪费宣传也应该是多方面的。报纸有必要选择有典型意义的重大浪费问题，动员和组织群众的力量，来进行深入的宣传。但如果报纸长时间纠缠在个别问题上，而没有吸引各方面的群众对各个方面的重大浪费现象进行有效的斗争，那就会把反浪费斗争限制在一个狭小的范围之内，削弱了报纸在这一斗争中的作用。辽宁日报曾经注意了这一点。它在支持皇姑屯机车车辆修理厂职工进行反浪费斗争的期间，对于其他方面的重大浪费问题，也进行了揭露和批判。报纸先后揭露的就有矿区中丢弃大量煤炭，降低了得煤率；工厂企业大量丢弃钢铁器材；一个工厂为了凑足生产和商品总值计划而长期生产废品和次品；工矿企业的仓库中积压大量机器设备和材料；民用建筑中的铺张浪费；一个市修建了可以不建的豪华的文化宫；粮食保管和消费中的浪费损失；一个国营食品公司不积极改善经营而制定了赔钱计划；省工业厅铺张浪费追求排场等等问题。可以看出，报纸上的这些揭发，包括了工业生产、基本建设、粮食的保管和消费、国营商业、国家机关等等各个方面。而对于工业生产方面浪费现象的揭发，又包括了产品质量、原材料的使用、设备和材料的储备、制定计划、管理制度、劳动纪律等等各个环节。由于浪费现象是普遍存在的，群众反浪费的要求也是在日益高涨着，报纸发动和支持群众从各个方面各个环节来揭露和克服浪费现象，就能够把反浪费斗争形成一个真正广泛的群众性的斗争。辽宁日报在进行一些重大批评时，像支持皇姑屯机车车辆修理厂职工开展批评一样，还支持群众和依靠群众的舆论力量，深入扩展了批评的效果。例如关于海城发生大量小麦虫害事件的批评，就是根据海城粮食局工作人员的一封来信加以揭发的。报纸除支持了这一批评，还引导读者针对辽宁省粮食厅的官僚主义、文牍主义作风，进行了连续的揭露和批评。另一方面，报纸也注意运用各种形式如评论、文章、漫画，以及辟设专栏的方法，来吸引群众开展批评。所有这些，都使得反浪费宣传的内容和形式更为丰富多样，使它能在更广泛的群众基础上得到发展。
    为了达到克服浪费改进工作的目的，报纸上的反浪费宣传，决不应该仅仅是简单的揭发，它还应该表扬坚持反对浪费的先进人物，介绍克服浪费的好的经验，报道开展斗争中出现的新气象，这样从正面从积极的方面来鼓舞群众进行斗争的积极性，以取得反浪费斗争的实际效果。在这方面，辽宁日报也有过不少的报道。例如报纸曾发表通讯和评论，表扬了第一机床厂铆焊车间铆焊工人杨玉芳，号召大家学习他从日常生产活动的小处着眼发现浪费现象，并勇敢坚决进行斗争的精神。报纸在开展“节约粮食、反对浪费行为”的斗争中接到了读者的一封来信，建议在铁路运粮中使用“油毡原纸铺车法”装运散积粮食如苞米、大豆等，以减少损失和节省开支。报纸当即派记者作了实地调查，证实这个方法确实很好，并在显著地位登出了读者的建议和报纸的调查经过，推广了这个经验。报纸还发表了反映皇姑屯机车车辆修理厂反浪费斗争后出现新气象的几封群众来信。在另一篇以“反浪费斗争以后”为题的通讯里，又曾经用具体的事实和数字，说明了辽东织绸三厂开展反浪费斗争后出现的新面貌。这些支持先进、交代作法、反映新事物的报道，正是反浪费宣传的一个不可缺少的方面。
    目前不少报纸已经重视了反浪费的宣传。其中有些报纸由于同群众缺乏广泛而密切的联系，不注意深入发动和组织群众，在宣传中产生了零碎、不深入的缺点。它们或者是到处揭发，没有抓住重大问题进行深入的宣传；或者长期纠缠在个别事件上，而不能吸引和动员各方面的群众，同各种浪费现象展开斗争；或者是不注意报道斗争中的先进人物、好的经验和新气象。这样，就脱离了实际生活对报纸的要求，不能真正取得克服浪费的实际效果。这种状况应该加以改变。为了改进报纸上的反浪费宣传，辽宁日报支持和依靠群众，从各方面深入反浪费宣传的经验，正可供我们的参考。
