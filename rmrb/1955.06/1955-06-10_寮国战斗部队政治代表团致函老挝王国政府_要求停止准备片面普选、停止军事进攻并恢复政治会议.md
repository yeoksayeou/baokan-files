Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 9th -- According to Vietnam News Agency on the 9th: The political delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces recently handed a letter to the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government. It demanded that the Royal Government immediately cease preparations for the illegal unilateral general election, stop the armed offensive against Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces, and resume political conferences between the two sides to discuss the issue of holding free general elections nationwide in accordance with the spirit and letter of the Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

The letter condemned the Royal Government's actions of interrupting political conferences, attacking the Lao Fighting Forces, and attempting to organize a unilateral general election. The letter pointed out that these actions by the Royal Government in violation of the Geneva Accords seriously threatened the peace and unification of Laos and nullified the democratic freedoms of Lao citizens that had been recognized by the Geneva Conference.

The letter stated: Organizing general elections is the responsibility of both parties concerned. The two sides should negotiate on this issue to ensure that all citizens have the freedom to elect or be elected, as well as the freedom to conduct election activities.

The letter was signed by Phoumi Vongvichit, head of the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces attending the Lao political conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 9th -- According to a broadcast by Saigon's French-Asian Radio on the 8th, a spokesman for the Royal Lao Government said that the Royal Government had informed the International Commission for Laos that it would "take military measures" against the Lao Fighting Forces in Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces.

News from Laos says that recently, the Royal Lao Government's troops have been frequently mobilized around Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces, and the Royal Government's troops' attacks on the Lao Fighting Forces in these two provinces have not stopped. At the same time, Vientiane Radio has stepped up its propaganda that the Lao Fighting Forces have "attacked" the Royal forces.

The Royal Lao Government spokesman's remarks have made some Lao people worry that the Royal Government may blatantly launch a large-scale military offensive against the Lao Fighting Forces.

    寮国战斗部队政治代表团致函老挝王国政府
    要求停止准备片面普选、停止军事进攻并恢复政治会议
    新华社河内九日电　据越南通讯社九日讯：寮国战斗部队政治代表团最近交给老挝王国政府政治代表团一封信。要求王国政府立即停止准备非法的片面普选，停止对桑怒省和丰沙里省进行武装进攻，恢复双方的政治会议，以便按照日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言的精神和文字，讨论在全国举行自由普选的问题。
    这封信谴责王国政府中断政治会议、进攻寮国战斗部队、企图组织片面普选的行为。这封信指出，王国政府方面这些违反日内瓦协定的行为严重地威胁了老挝的和平和统一，并且取消了已经得到日内瓦会议承认的老挝公民的民主自由权利。
    这封信说：组织普选是有关双方的责任。双方应该就这个问题进行谈判，以便保证一切公民都得到选举或被选举的自由以及进行选举活动的自由。
    在信件上签字的是出席老挝政治会议的寮国战斗部队政治代表团团长富米。
    新华社河内九日电　据西贡法亚电台八日广播，老挝王国政府发言人说，王国政府已经告知老挝国际委员会，将对丰沙里、桑怒两省的寮国战斗部队“采取军事措施”。
    从老挝来的消息说，最近，在丰沙里、桑怒两省周围，老挝王国政府军队调动频繁，王国政府的军队在这两省内对寮国战斗部队的攻击一直没有停止。同时万象电台却加紧宣传寮国战斗部队“进攻”了王国部队。
    老挝王国政府发言人的谈话使一些老挝人士担忧王国政府可能明目张胆地向寮国战斗部队发动大规模的军事进攻。
