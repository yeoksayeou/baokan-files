Jinan, Shandong – Since June 15th, the people of Jinan have actively launched a publicity campaign against criminal offences, exposing the crimes of a group of hooligans and villains, habitual thieves, and all criminals who disrupt social order and corrupt moral standards, recently arrested. Three hundred and fifty propagandists and speakers throughout the city have been holding report meetings and forums in various street communities. Workers in factories have also been holding discussions and debates. The Jinan Public Security Bureau has dispatched public security propaganda vehicles to conduct publicity in streets, factories and mines. On the 16th alone, more than 13,000 workers and citizens received direct education. Everyone unanimously believes that these remnants of society are one of the biggest obstacles to our current construction of a socialist society and we must heighten our vigilance and resolutely eliminate them. The recent arrest of this group of criminal offenders in Jinan has received strong support and assistance from the people. Citizens Ma Yulan, Zhu Xinmin, and five others reported eight escaped hooligans and bandits. Militia Captain Chen Mingyou and many others voluntarily assisted the public security organs in arresting Shi Chuanzhong, a hooligan who resisted arrest and fled. When He Jianqin was arrested, his son, He Fangting, told the public security personnel on the spot, "He is always sneaky with bad people and has an ulterior motive, there must be a problem." Huang Shouchun expressed gratitude to the government for arresting his hooligan son, and requested that the government sentence him to several more years of imprisonment for labor reform.

    济南开展反对刑事犯罪的宣传活动
    山东济南市人民群众自六月十五日以来，积极开展反对刑事犯罪的宣传活动，揭发最近逮捕的一批流氓恶棍，惯盗惯窃以及扰乱社会治安、败坏道德风尚等一切犯罪分子的罪恶。全市有三百五十名宣传员和报告员，连日来在各街道市民中召开了报告会、座谈会；工厂的工人也都进行了座谈、讨论。济南市公安局派出了公安宣传车在各街头、厂矿进行宣传，十六日一天直接受到教育的工人、市民即有一万三千多人。大家一致认为这些社会的余孽，是我们当前建设社会主义社会的最大障碍之一，必须提高警惕，坚决肃清。济南市最近逮捕这一批刑事犯罪分子，得到人民群众的大力支持和协助。市民马玉兰、朱新民等七人，检举了漏网的流氓、盗匪分子八人。民兵队长陈明友和群众多人自动协助公安机关逮捕了拒捕潜逃的流氓分子史传忠。在逮捕何见琴时，他儿子何芳亭当场向公安人员说：“他经常同坏人鬼鬼祟祟，明去暗来的，一定有问题。”黄寿龄对政府逮捕他的流氓儿子表示感谢，并要求政府多判他几年徒刑，进行劳动改造。（本报驻济南记者）
