Xinjiang Province Starts Surveying the Tarim River

The Xinjiang Provincial Comprehensive Economic Survey Team departed from Urumqi on the 14th to survey the Tarim River, China's longest inland river, in the Tarim Basin. Part of the survey team will use wooden boats in Aksu to test the navigation from the Tarim River to Tieganlike downstream to investigate the water level, flow, and river conditions of the Tarim River. Another part of the team will investigate minerals, climate, hydrology, wasteland, and wild plants on both sides of the Tarim River.

The Tarim River is more than 2,000 kilometers long. During the flood season, the river flow reaches more than 2,000 cubic meters per second. The section from Aksu County to Yuli County is about 700 kilometers long and has navigable conditions. The land on both sides is fertile and grows a large amount of wild hemp, large wild Chinese parasol tree forests, and is rich in grain and cotton. After the Tarim River is opened to navigation, the transportation difficulties of a large amount of wild hemp, wood, and agricultural products in the middle reaches will be appropriately resolved. At the same time, it will create favorable conditions for reclaiming wasteland in the middle reaches. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆省着手勘查塔里木河
    新疆省综合经济调查队十四日从乌鲁木齐出发，前往塔里木盆地，勘查我国最长的内陆河塔里木河。调查队一部分人员将在阿克苏用木船试航从塔里木河到下游的铁干里克地方，以调查塔里木河的水位、流量和河道情况；另一部分人员将在塔里木河两岸调查矿产、气候、水文、荒地和野生植物。
    塔里木河全长两千多公里。洪水时期，河水流量达两千多秒公方。从阿克苏县到尉犁县一段长约七百公里，有通航条件。两岸土地肥沃，生长着大量的野麻，大片野梧桐树林，还盛产粮、棉。塔里木河通航以后，中游两岸地区的大量野麻、木料和农产品的运输困难就会得到适当解决。同时为开垦中游一带的荒地创造有利条件。　　　　（新华社）
