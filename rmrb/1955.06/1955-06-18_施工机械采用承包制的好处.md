As the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company expands daily, the variety of machinery in the Anshan Construction Company's Mechanization Supply Station is also increasing. If we take the state's investment in the Mechanization Supply Station's machinery and equipment as 100 in 1952, it was 250 in 1953 and has reached 450 in 1954. The existing major construction machinery, such as various single-bucket and multi-bucket excavators, bulldozers, graders, scarifiers, and cranes, has increased fourfold compared to 1952.

In the past three years, the Mechanization Supply Station has completed huge engineering tasks. The level of management has also improved accordingly. From the perspective of machinery utilization rate (calculated by machine hours), it was 29% in 1952, 36% in 1953, and 47% in 1954. The usage fee per machine shift has been reduced three times from 1952 to the present. The first reduction was 20%, the second was 18%, and the third (this April) was another 27.9%. In 1953, it cost 222 yuan to rent an excavator for one day, but this year it only costs 84 yuan.

The Anshan Mechanization Supply Station has two management methods: machinery leasing and project contracting. The characteristic of machinery leasing is that the Mechanization Supply Station only has a leasing relationship with the construction site. It only allocates machinery according to the construction site's application and charges according to the number of shifts, regardless of work efficiency. All the organization and command of the machinery is the responsibility of the construction site. The characteristic of project contracting is that, in addition to providing machinery, the Mechanization Supply Station is also responsible for the entire project's progress, quality requirements, organization and command of machinery construction, and charges construction fees according to the completed actual workload.

Before August 1953, there was little heavy machinery and the construction area was relatively narrow, so the leasing system was mainly adopted. After August 1953, as machinery increased and the construction area expanded, and in view of the leasing system's failure to maximize machinery utilization, the project contracting system was introduced on a trial basis based on advanced Soviet experience. The results proved that the project contracting system is the most effective method for improving machinery efficiency and reducing construction costs. Since 1954, the Mechanization Supply Station has vigorously promoted the project contracting system. In the workload completed in 1954, 40% was completed by contracting. Of the 660,000 cubic meters of earthwork completed by excavators in the Mechanization Supply Station last year, 460,000 cubic meters were completed under the contract system.

The implementation of the project contracting system has changed the passive situation in the work of the Mechanization Supply Station and enhanced the initiative and sense of responsibility in the business management of the Mechanization Supply Station. When the leasing system was implemented, the Mechanization Supply Station was only responsible for supplying machinery and did not understand the engineering tasks. In addition, the projects were unbalanced, unplanned, and highly rushed. The user units requested machinery from the Mechanization Supply Station with temporary phone calls, and often did not even know the next day's tasks. However, after the implementation of the project contracting system, the Mechanization Supply Station can change from passive to active, and can reasonably consider how to use various machines to organize construction in order to improve machinery efficiency.

The promotion of the project contracting system has also reduced mechanical accidents and overcome the phenomenon of lax labor discipline among drivers. When the machinery leasing system was implemented, the Mechanization Supply Station only managed the attendance of the machinery and did not care about the amount of work completed, while the user units often only cared about completing the task and did not care about the operation and maintenance of the machinery. This has led to an increase in mechanical accidents and lax labor discipline.

Last year, the Mechanization Supply Station had more than 100 mechanical accidents, most of which occurred under the machinery leasing system. After the implementation of the project contracting system, the Mechanization Supply Station must assign cadres to organize and command construction work, which strengthens the management of the construction site and the inspection of drivers' machinery operation, maintenance, and labor discipline, thereby reducing accidents.

For the above reasons, the project contracting system has created high machinery efficiency that was not possible under the machinery leasing system. According to statistics from the Mechanization Supply Station from January to October last year, the average efficiency of excavators was only 187 cubic meters per shift when rented, but 345 cubic meters per shift under contract. The highest, such as a one-cubic-meter capacity excavator, excavated more than 1,000 cubic meters of earth per shift.

As the machinery utilization rate increases, the cost also decreases. According to statistics from the Steelmaking Engineering Company, the cost of excavating earth per cubic meter with rented excavators is equivalent to 2.1 yuan. If manual labor is used, the cost is only 0.32 yuan per cubic meter. Using machinery is more than six times more expensive than manual labor. However, with the implementation of the project contracting system and the improvement of machinery efficiency, the cost of excavating general soil with excavators is only 0.25 yuan per cubic meter. Obviously, using machinery is still much cheaper than using manual labor.

The transition from the leasing system to the contracting system is an important development in the management of mechanized construction, marking the Mechanization Supply Station's move from simply supplying machinery to independently organizing construction. However, based on the current situation of the Anshan Mechanization Supply Station, to fully realize the role of the contracting system, many problems still need to be solved. One of the more important issues is solving the scope of contracting. The contracting system of the Mechanization Supply Station is divided into "major contracting" and "minor contracting" in terms of the scope of contracting. "Major contracting" means not only guaranteeing project progress and specification requirements, but also contracting some auxiliary projects that serve mechanical construction, such as lighting, repair of machinery travel roads, drainage, and frozen soil blasting. "Minor contracting" means only guaranteeing project progress and specification requirements, while all other auxiliary work is carried out in cooperation with the contracting unit. From the perspective of these two methods, those with the strength should try to adopt the form of "major contracting" as much as possible. If there is no strength and "minor contracting" needs to be adopted, the responsibilities of both parties in the mechanical construction process must be clearly stipulated. However, judging from the situation in the first quarter of this year, this problem has not been well resolved, and there are still phenomena of non-cooperation. Due to the unclear scope of contracting and the responsibilities of both parties, work stoppages often occur during construction.

Organizing and managing heavy machinery to implement the project contracting system is a very complex and heavy task. According to advanced Soviet experience, to do this work well, it is necessary to prepare an annual engineering mechanization plan and establish a quarterly and monthly balance system. At the same time, a mechanized construction organization design for individual projects should also be prepared, considering the construction methods in detail, considering the close coordination between the main and auxiliary machinery, and considering the establishment of one's own construction work areas in key project areas, etc. In this regard, the Anshan Mechanization Supply Station has gained some experience since 1954, but from the requirements and development of the project, this is only the beginning, and there are many problems that still need to be further studied and resolved. For example, the Mechanization Supply Station currently lacks engineering and technical personnel for organizing construction. There are only three people, and there is not even a technician who studies civil engineering and hoisting projects, which is very closely related to contracting projects. The formulated engineering mechanization plan cannot be fully implemented. Either the construction preparation work of the contracting unit is not good, so the project cannot start on schedule, or the Mechanization Supply Station itself does not organize the project well, resulting in machinery stoppages. For example, in this year's earthwork project, the original plan was to use machinery to complete a workload of more than 1.6 million cubic meters, but because the organizational work was lagging behind, only 20% of the plan has been completed so far, which seriously affects the project progress.

The Anshan Mechanization Supply Station currently only implements the contracting system for earthwork projects, and has not yet promoted it in hoisting work. This year, the leaders of Anshan Construction Company have instructed that the Mechanization Supply Station's future business model should be based on the project contracting system. Wherever there are conditions for implementing the contracting system, the contracting method should be adopted for construction. The Mechanization Supply Station is also actively creating experience and further expanding the scope of contracting. However, after the implementation of the project contracting system, in fact, because the amount of work in some places is fragmented, measurement is difficult, and the time for using machinery is short, the leasing system is still needed. However, the leasing system can also use more piece-rate leasing and less time-based leasing, because piece-rate leasing charges based on the completed actual workload, which is more efficient. If the conditions for piece-rate are very difficult, time-based leasing can also be adopted, but in addition to strengthening management, time-based leasing must be charged according to the actual completed working hours. When work stoppage is caused by the responsibility of the user unit, a stoppage fee (i.e., labor and management fee) should be charged. This will further strengthen the sense of responsibility of the machinery drivers and prevent the Mechanization Supply Station from increasing the cost of mechanized construction due to charging unreasonable fees.

    施工机械采用承包制的好处
    鞍钢建设公司总机械师室技术员　冯世明
    随着鞍钢工业建设的日益扩大，鞍钢建设公司机械化供应站的各种机械也日益增多。国家对机械化供应站机械设备的投资，若以一九五二年为一百，一九五三年则为二百五十，一九五四年已达四百五十。现有的主要建筑机械，如各式单斗和多斗挖掘机、推土机、平土机、松土机、起重机等的数量，比一九五二年增加了四倍。
    三年来，机械化供应站完成了巨大的工程任务。管理水平也随之提高了。从机械利用率（按台时计算）来看，一九五二年为百分之二十九，一九五三年为百分之三十六，一九五四年为百分之四十七。机械每台班使用费从一九五二年到现在，已降低了三次，第一次降低百分之二十，第二次降低百分之十八，第三次（即今年四月）又降低百分之二十七点九。一九五三年一台挖土机出租一天要二百二十二元，今年只要八十四元。
    鞍钢机械化供应站的经营管理方式有两种，即机械租赁制和工程承包制。机械租赁制的特点是，机械化供应站跟工地仅是租赁关系，只是按照工地申请配备机械，不论工作效率如何，一律按台班收费，一切机械的组织和指挥工作全由工地负责。工程承包制的特点是，机械化供应站除了配备机械外，还要负责全部工程的进度、质量要求、机械施工的组织和指挥工作，并按照完成的实物工作量收取施工费用。
    一九五三年以前，重型机械少，施工面较狭，主要是采取租赁制。一九五三年八月以后，机械增多，施工面扩大，同时鉴于租赁制不能发挥机械利用效率，便根据苏联先进经验开始试行工程承包制度。结果证明工程承包制度是提高机械效率和降低施工成本的最有效的方法。从一九五四年起，机械化供应站就大力推行工程承包制。在一九五四年完成的工作量中，用承包方式完成的占百分之四十。去年机械化供应站挖土机完成的六十六万立方公尺土方中，用承包制完成的达四十六万立方公尺。
    实行工程承包制后，改变了机械化供应站工作中的被动情况，增强了机械化供应站经营管理上的积极性和责任心。实行租赁制时，机械化供应站只负责供应机械，不了解工程任务，再加上工程不平衡、无计划、突击性大，使用单位向机械化供应站要机械临时用电话通知，甚至今天还不知道明天的任务。而实行工程承包制后，机械化供应站就能从被动转向主动，能够合理地考虑如何利用各种机械来组织施工，以提高机械效率。
    推行工程承包制的结果，也减少了机械事故，克服了驾驶员劳动纪律松懈的现象。实行机械租赁制时，机械化供应站只管机械出勤，不管完成任务多少，而使用单位则常常只管完成任务，不管机械操作保养。这就使机械事故增多，劳动纪律松懈。
    去年机械化供应站共发生机械事故一百余件，其中大部分是采取机械租赁制时发生的。实行工程承包制后，机械化供应站必须委派干部进行施工组织和指挥工作，就加强了施工现场的管理及对驾驶员机械操作、保养工作和劳动纪律的检查，从而也就减少了事故。
    由于以上原因，工程承包制就创造了机械租赁制时所没有的高度机械效率。根据机械化供应站去年一月到十月的统计，挖土机的平均效率在出租时每台班只完成一百八十七立方公尺，承包时每台班可完成三百四十五立方公尺，最高的如容积一立方公尺的挖土机每台班挖土达一千多立方公尺。
    机械利用率提高了，成本也就降低了。根据炼钢工程公司的统计，出租挖土机挖土每立方公尺成本相当于二元一角，如用人工每立方公尺只需三角二分就够了，用机械比人工贵六倍多。而实行工程承包制，提高机械效率后，挖土机每立方公尺成本挖一般土质只需二角五分，显然用机械仍然比用人工便宜得多。
    从租赁制到承包制是机械化施工经营管理方式的一个重要发展，标志着机械化供应站从单纯供应机械走上独立组织施工的道路。但是，根据鞍钢机械化供应站目前的情况来看，要想充分发挥承包制的作用，还要解决很多问题。其中比较重要的，就是解决承包范围问题。机械化供应站的承包制从其承包的范围来看，有“大包工”、“小包工”之分。所谓“大包工”，就是不仅包工程进度，包规格要求，而且还包一些服务于机械施工的辅助工程，如照明、机械行走道路修补、排水、冻土爆破等工作。所谓“小包工”，就是只包工程进度、规格要求，其它一切辅助工作都由发包单位配合进行。从这两种方式来看，凡是有力量的应该尽量采用“大包工”的形式，如果没有力量，需要采取“小包工”时，就必须明确规定甲乙双方在机械施工过程中的责任。但从今年第一季度情况来看，这个问题还没有很好解决，仍有互不协作的现象。由于承包范围和甲乙双方责任不明，经常造成施工过程中的停工。
    组织和管理重型机械实行工程承包制，是一件十分复杂、繁重的工作。根据苏联先进经验，要做好这一工作，就要编制年度工程机械化计划，建立按季逐月平衡制度。同时，还应编制单位工程机械化施工组织设计，周密考虑施工方法，考虑主要的和辅助的机械互相密切配合问题，考虑在重点工程区域建立自己的施工工区等。在这方面，鞍钢机械化供应站，从一九五四年以来，已经取得了一定经验，但从工程的要求和发展来看，这只是开始，有许多问题还需要进一步研究解决。如机械化供应站目前组织施工的工程技术人员还十分缺乏，只有三名，对承包工程关系十分密切的学土木及吊装工程的技术员一名也没有。制定的工程机械化计划还不能全部执行。不是由于发包单位施工准备工作不好，使工程不能按期开工，就是由于机械化供应站本身对工程组织不好，造成机械停工。如今年土方工程中，原计划用机械完成工作量一百六十余万立方公尺，但因为组织工作落后，直到现在为止，还只完成计划的百分之二十，这就严重地影响了工程进度。
    鞍钢机械化供应站目前实行承包制的还只限于土方工程，在吊装工作中还没有推行。今年鞍钢建设公司领导方面已经指示：机械化供应站今后经营方式应以工程承包制为主，凡是有条件实行承包制的地方，都应采取承包方式进行施工。机械化供应站也在积极创造经验，进一步扩大承包面。但是，推行工程承包制后，事实上由于某些地方工程量零碎，计量困难，使用机械的时间也短，因此，还是需要租赁制的。不过，租赁制也可多采用计件租赁，少用计时租赁，因为计件租赁是以完成实物工作量收费的，这样效率就高。假若计件条件十分困难的话，也可以采取计时租赁，但是实行计时租赁除了应加强对其管理外，必须按实际完成工作台时收费。由于使用单位的责任造成停工时，则应收取停置费（即人工和管理费）。这样就能进一步加强机械驾驶员的责任心，堵塞了机械化供应站由于收取不合理费用而提高机械化施工成本的漏洞。
