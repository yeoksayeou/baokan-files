Shanghai has set up 39 lecture stations according to different districts, government offices, schools, and industrial systems. These lecture stations have held more than 90 reports on the important significance of promoting materialism and criticizing idealism, Hu Shih's reactionary political thought, and Hu Feng's reactionary thought.
