Xinhua News Agency, June 9th—At the inaugural meeting of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Academic Divisions on the 8th and the morning of the 9th, scientists presented thirty-nine academic papers, which demonstrated the major achievements of the scientific community's research work since the founding of New China.

    Four papers were presented at the plenary session on the morning of the 9th. Geologist Li Siguang's "Spiral Structures and Other Issues Related to the Complex of the Tectonic System in Northwest China" analyzed the causes of large and small spiral structures and pointed out the interconnections between the problems discussed and the search for petroleum and mineral resources. Philosopher Hu Sheng's "Idealism is the Enemy of Science" and philosopher Ai Siqi's "Pragmatism—An Anti-Scientific Subjective Idealist Methodology" profoundly analyzed the anti-scientific nature of Hu Shih's subjective idealist thought and expounded on Marxist-Leninist philosophy. Chemist Wang You's "Research on the Chemistry of Citrinin" resolved the chemical structure and synthesis of citrinin and its related compounds and understood their antibacterial efficacy and mechanisms of antibacterial action.

    Thirty-five papers were presented at the group meetings of the various academic divisions. The eight papers presented at the group meeting of the Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry Division included research in the areas of nuclear force, internal friction of metals, general space geometry, the theory of univalent functions, elasticity, chemical components of traditional Chinese medicine, intramolecular rotation, and synthetic rubber.

    The papers from the Biology and Earth Sciences departments numbered eleven, including studies on the geology and agriculture of the Tibetan Plateau and the impact of the Tibetan Plateau on the weather; the physiology of aureomycin, the breeding of the winter wheat variety "Bima No. 1," the life history of *Porphyra tenera*, the effects of phospholipids on tissues, the lapinized rinderpest virus vaccine, the sedimentary conditions of manganese ore deposits in China, the stratigraphy of Northeast China, and the division of China's Mesozoic continental formations based on the perspective of plant evolution.

    The nine papers in the field of technical sciences included studies on the effects of fluorine on blast furnace slag, side-blown basic converter production, Soviet low-alloy steel substitutes, ductile iron processing, molten iron catalyst synthesis of liquid fuels, cobalt catalyst manufacturing, shale oil evaluation and identification, China's natural alkali industry, and truss rigid frame analysis.

    The seven papers in the fields of philosophy and social sciences included periodization of modern Chinese history, the historical background of "Dream of the Red Chamber," the excavation of the Yangshao culture site at Banpo Village in Xi'an, the distribution relationship of products in semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives, the question of whether or not Chinese has parts of speech, a critique of reactionary semantic philosophy, and research on the Dai language of Xishuangbanna.

    The scientists attending the conference all valued these papers and discussed them, engaging in academic debates, which led to the revision and supplementation of many papers.
