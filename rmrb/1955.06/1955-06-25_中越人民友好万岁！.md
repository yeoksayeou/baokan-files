    The government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has arrived in Beijing today for a friendly visit to our country at the invitation of our government. The Chinese people feel honored and excited about the visit of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh, and the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    China and Vietnam are brotherly countries in Asia. The people of the two countries have had thousands of years of traditional friendship, sharing weal and woe and common interests. On the front lines of the anti-imperialist struggle, we have always sympathized with each other and been closely united. After the Chinese people achieved revolutionary victory and the People's Republic of China was founded, our two countries quickly established diplomatic relations. In recent years, the relations between our two countries have been continuously consolidated and developed. The exchanges between the people of the two countries have also become increasingly close. Continuously strengthening the close friendship between China and Vietnam not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese and Vietnamese people, but is also an important factor in maintaining peace in Asia.
    The Vietnamese people are heroic, hardworking, and peace-loving people. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, and with the sympathy and support of international peace forces, they have won many victories in the struggle for independence, unity, democracy, and peace. In 1945, the Vietnamese people achieved the victory of the August Revolution, ending nearly a century of colonial rule and establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. American interventionists supported the French colonialists in carrying out a colonial war, attempting to re-impose the shackles of enslavement on the Vietnamese people. However, they suffered a shameful defeat. After eight years of heroic resistance, the Vietnamese people finally won a brilliant victory. They won the major support of international peace forces for the just cause of striving for a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue. Therefore, they obtained the Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference, winning international guarantees for the realization of national unification.
    The victorious struggle of the Vietnamese people has been enthusiastically praised by righteous humanity and is a major encouragement to all people striving for independence, freedom, and peace. This victorious struggle is an important contribution to peace in Asia and the world.
    After the ceasefire, the Vietnamese people vigorously carried out the arduous task of restoring and developing the national economy. They launched a vigorous land reform movement. Thousands upon thousands of peasants are rising up to fight for the abolition of feudal land ownership and the liberation of rural productive forces. On the basis of the initial victories in land reform, agricultural production in northern Vietnam has greatly recovered and developed. This year's early rice yield will increase by half compared to last year. Industry and mining, as well as handicrafts, are also resuming work and expanding production. The achievements in restoring railway and highway transportation are also remarkable. The Hanoi-Nanning railway has been repaired and opened to traffic in just four months. This year, the Hanoi-Lao Cai and Wen Dien-Nam Dinh railways will also be repaired. Most of the highways have also been restored to traffic. The Vietnamese working people have demonstrated a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm in healing the wounds of war and restoring economic production. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has embarked on a brilliant path of consolidation and development. The Chinese people are delighted to see the significant achievements of our brothers, the Vietnamese people, in construction.
    After the Geneva Conference, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam faithfully abided by all the provisions of the Geneva Accords. In order to safeguard the thorough implementation of the agreement, it is carrying out an unyielding struggle. The Vietnamese people have become a powerful factor in defending peace. The Vietnamese people have participated in the movement to maintain peace and promote international cooperation in the Asia-Africa region and throughout the world, resolutely opposing all war conspiracies, advocating the settlement of international disputes through negotiation to ease tensions. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong, played an active role at the Asian-African Conference. Now, the Vietnamese people are working hard to organize nationwide general elections through consultation in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords to achieve the unification of their country.
    The American ruling clique, which is bent on turning Indochina into a hotbed of war, has consistently adopted a hostile attitude towards the Vietnamese people's struggle for peace, unity, independence, and democracy, and has increasingly intensified its interference, attempting to undermine the Geneva Accords and disrupt peace in Indochina. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, cobbled together by the United States, openly dragged South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into its "protection" sphere. The United States' interference activities in South Vietnam are even more unscrupulous, and it attempts to turn South Vietnam into a second South Korea. Now the United States is trying to sabotage the Vietnamese general elections, split Vietnam, and turn South Vietnam into an American military base.
    The obstruction and sabotage activities of the United States and its followers to prevent the unification of Vietnam are unacceptable to the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people. The countries concerned that bear the obligations of the Geneva Accords have a greater responsibility to promptly stop these conspiracies of the United States and support the Vietnamese people's desire to achieve unification. We believe that in the arduous struggle to maintain peace and realize the democratic unification of the country, the Vietnamese people will surely be able to obtain the support of all peace-loving countries and people, overcome difficulties, and achieve victory.
    At a time when the Chinese people are launching a great socialist construction and resolutely struggling to safeguard territorial sovereignty, we feel particularly cordial in receiving the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by the leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh. We believe that through this visit of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the friendship between the people of China and Vietnam will be further developed and consolidated. This friendship will surely make new contributions to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.
    Long Live the Friendship Between the Chinese and Vietnamese People!

### 中越人民友好万岁！

    中越人民友好万岁！
    越南民主共和国胡志明主席率领的越南民主共和国政府代表团，应我国政府的邀请，来我国作友好的访问，今天到达北京。中国人民对于越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府代表团的访问，感到光荣和兴奋。
    中、越两国是亚洲的兄弟之邦。两国人民曾有过数千年的传统友谊，素来是休戚相关，利害与共。在反帝国主义的战线上，我们一直是互相同情，紧密地团结在一起。中国人民取得了革命胜利，中华人民共和国诞生以后，我们两国很快就建立了外交关系。最近几年来，我们两国关系不断地得到了巩固和发展。两国人民之间的来往也日益密切。不断加强中越两国的亲切友谊，不仅符合中、越人民的利益，而且是维护亚洲和平的重要因素。
    越南人民是英勇的、勤劳的人民，是热爱和平的人民。他们在胡志明主席的领导下，在国际和平力量的同情和支持下，在争取独立、统一、民主、和平的斗争中曾经赢得了多次胜利。一九四五年越南人民取得了八月革命的胜利，结束了将近一世纪的殖民地统治，建立了越南民主共和国。美国干涉者支持法国殖民者进行殖民战争，企图把奴役的枷锁重新加在越南人民身上。但是，他们遭到了可耻的失败。越南人民经过了八年的英勇抗战终于赢得了辉煌的胜利。他们为争取和平解决越南问题的正义事业博得了国际和平力量的重大支持。因此，他们在日内瓦会议上获得了恢复印度支那和平的协议，赢得了实现国家统一的国际保证。
    越南人民的胜利斗争得到了正义人类的热情赞扬，是对一切争取独立、自由与和平的人民的重大鼓舞。这个胜利斗争是对亚洲和世界和平的重要贡献。
    越南人民在停战后就大力进行恢复和发展国民经济的艰巨工作。他们轰轰烈烈地展开了土地改革运动。成千上万的农民正在奋起为废除封建土地所有制、解放农村生产力而斗争。在土地改革取得初步胜利的基础上，越南北部的农业生产已有很大的恢复和发展。今年夏稻的产量就将比去年增加一半。工矿业和手工业也正在纷纷复工和扩大生产。恢复铁路和公路交通的成绩也很显著。河内—睦南关铁路在短短四个月内就已修复通车。今年还要修复河内—老街、文典—南定的铁路。公路也已大部恢复通车。越南劳动人民在医治战争创伤，恢复经济的生产战线上，表现了高度的爱国主义劳动热忱。越南民主共和国已经走上了巩固和发展的光辉道路。中国人民欢欣地看到我们的弟兄越南人民在建设方面所得到的重大成就。
    日内瓦会议后，越南民主共和国忠实地遵守了日内瓦协议的一切规定。为了维护协议的彻底实施，它正在进行不屈不挠的斗争。越南人民已成为保卫和平的有力因素。越南人民参加了亚非地区和全世界维护和平和促进国际合作的运动，坚决反对一切战争阴谋，主张用协商方式解决国际争端，以缓和紧张局势。以范文同副总理兼外长为首的越南民主共和国代表团曾在亚非会议上起了积极的作用。现在，越南人民正在根据日内瓦协议的规定为经过协商组织全国普选，实现自己国家的统一而努力。
    一心想把印度支那变为战争温床的美国统治集团，对越南人民争取和平、统一、独立和民主的斗争，一贯地采取敌视的态度，并日益变本加厉地进行干涉，企图破坏日内瓦协议，破坏印度支那的和平。美国拼凑的东南亚条约组织，公然把南越、老挝和柬埔寨拉入“保护”范围之内。美国在南越的干涉活动，更是肆无忌惮，它企图把南越变为南朝鲜第二。现在美国更力图破坏越南普选，分裂越南，把南越变成美国的军事基地。
    美国及其追随者阻挠越南的统一的破坏活动，是越南人民和所有爱好和平的人民所不能容许的。承担着日内瓦协议的义务的有关国家，更有责任及时制止美国的这些阴谋活动，支持越南人民要求实现统一的愿望。我们相信，越南人民在维护和平、实现国家民主统一的艰巨斗争中，必然能够取得一切爱好和平国家和人民的支持，战胜困难，取得胜利。
    正当中国人民展开伟大的社会主义建设，并为维护领土主权而坚决斗争的时候，我们接待越南人民的领袖胡志明主席率领的越南民主共和国政府代表团，特别感到亲切。我们相信，经过越南民主共和国政府代表团的这次访问，中越两国人民的友谊一定会得到进一步的发展和巩固。这种友谊对远东和世界和平的事业一定会作出新的贡献。
    中越人民友好万岁！
