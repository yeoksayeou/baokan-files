Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, May 31st: According to TASS, the National Committee of the Uruguayan Communist Party held a plenary session in Montevideo. The meeting heard and discussed a report by Communist Party General Secretary Gómez on the situation of the working masses. The meeting pointed out that Uruguay is suffering a deep crisis, the cause of which is: the Uruguayan government is willing to sacrifice national interests for the sake of the United States. The number of unemployed people in the country is constantly increasing, and prices are constantly rising. At the same time, the struggle of the working people to improve their situation and to strive for peace and national independence is also widely unfolding.
    The National Committee of the Uruguayan Communist Party called on the Uruguayan people to strengthen the struggle for peace and actively sign the "Appeal to the People of the World."

    乌拉圭共产党全国委员会举行全体会议
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚五月三十一日讯：乌拉圭共产党全国委员会在蒙得维的亚举行了全体会议。会议听取并且讨论了共产党总书记戈麦斯所作的关于劳动群众境况的报告。会议指出，乌拉圭遭到深刻的危机，产生危机的原因是：乌拉圭政府为了美国而甘愿牺牲民族的利益。国内失业人数不断增加，物价不断上涨。同时，劳动人民争取改善自己的处境、争取和平和民族独立的斗争也广泛地展开了。
    乌拉圭共产党全国委员会号召乌拉圭人民加强争取和平的斗争，积极在“告全世界人民书”上签名。
