    Precision Gauge Blocks Successfully Trial-Produced

    The most precise measuring tool – gauge blocks – have been successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory. After scientific evaluation, the product quality meets the standards. These measuring tools are now beginning to be produced in small batches.

    Gauge blocks are the most accurate measuring tools in modern industry. They can measure and calibrate all precision mechanical parts. A gauge block has to go through twenty-six processes such as milling, heat treatment, rough grinding, and fine grinding, and must be manufactured in a specially designed workshop where the temperature is constantly maintained at 20 degrees Celsius.

    精密量具块规试制成功
    最精密的量具——块规在国营哈尔滨量具刃具厂试制成功。经过科学鉴定，产品质量合乎标准。现在，这种量具已经开始小批生产。
    块规是近代工业中最精确的量具。它能测量和校正一切精密的机械零件。一块块规要经过铣、热处理、粗磨、精磨等二十六道工序，并且要在经常保持着摄氏二十度气温的特设车间里制造。
