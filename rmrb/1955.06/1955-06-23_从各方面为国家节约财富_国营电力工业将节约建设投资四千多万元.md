    Conserving National Wealth in All Aspects
    State-owned Power Industry to Save Over 40 Million Yuan in Construction Investment
    The national state-owned power industry will save 45 million yuan in basic construction investment this year without reducing project progress or compromising project quality. This savings figure was determined at the National Power Industry Basic Construction Conference held by the Electric Power Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry from June 16th to 20th.
    After discussing Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on "Practicing Thrift and Striving to Complete Socialist Construction," the representatives from various regions focused on examining the excessively high standards for non-production and production-related auxiliary buildings, as well as the wasteful phenomena in design and construction within the power industry's basic construction. The conference stipulated that all projects in the national power industry system that have not yet commenced construction will be built in accordance with the standards stipulated by the central government. The average cost of offices will be reduced from over 100 yuan per square meter to 60 yuan, and dormitories will be reduced from over 70 yuan per square meter to 40 yuan. It is estimated that merely through non-production construction projects such as offices and dormitories, more than 4.5 million yuan in investment can be saved in the second half of the year. Construction units under the Electric Power Management Bureau, such as the newly built Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang thermal power plants, are preparing to convert more than 8,000 square meters of temporary buildings on construction sites into permanent dormitories for employees, and plan to reduce some deferrable projects such as changing rooms and infirmaries. It is estimated that the implementation of these measures can save the construction costs of over 20,000 square meters of housing area.
     The conference also proposed saving measures in design and construction management. According to preliminary calculations, design units alone can save 9 million yuan in total project cost this year in terms of material and equipment selection and correct calculation of coefficient standards. Construction units can also save more than 8 million yuan in construction costs this year by improving construction management, overcoming material waste, and reasonably adjusting labor organization. In the past, the North China and East China Electric Power Design Bureaus used reinforced concrete power poles instead of iron towers when designing high-voltage power lines, which saved one-third of the cost for each line and ensured project quality. Now, each design unit is preparing to re-examine all lines, stipulating that all lines that can be changed should be changed to reinforced concrete power poles. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Ministry of Foreign Trade Reduces Project Costs
    The Ministry of Foreign Trade has re-examined this year's basic construction plan; preliminary calculations show that it can save more than 2.5 million yuan compared to the original plan.
    Due to the lack of uniform investment quota standards for various projects in the Ministry of Foreign Trade's original plan, the unit cost was generally high. The Chengdu Native Produce Export Company's warehouse was originally planned at 91 yuan per square meter, but in reality, only 50 to 60 yuan is needed. The Tianjin Xinhe Grain, Oil and Grease Export Company's warehouse originally required steel-wood trusses for fire prevention, with a cost of 100 yuan per square meter, but now reducing the amount of steel can achieve the same effect, and the cost can be reduced to 73 yuan. The Guangdong Keqi Silk Company's warehouse was originally planned at 64 yuan per square meter, but in reality, only 45 yuan is needed. These phenomena of high costs have all been corrected.
    In the original plan, the cost of some auxiliary projects was also much higher. For example, the toilet of the Hankou Native Produce Export Company's warehouse was originally planned at 85 yuan per square meter; the toilet of the Tianjin Native Produce Export Company's jute processing plant even reached 100 yuan per square meter. These unreasonable phenomena have also been corrected. The investment in general miscellaneous projects and miscellaneous purchases has also been reduced, saving approximately 500,000 yuan.
    At the beginning of 1955, the Ministry of Foreign Trade had requested the central government to increase basic construction investment because it was too small and insufficient for distribution. After this calculation, not only is no additional investment needed, but the funds required for the original plan can also be saved and turned over. (Guangxi, Peiyi)
  Mass Thrift Campaign Launched on Construction Sites in Anshan
    A mass campaign of practicing thrift and opposing waste is underway on various construction sites in Anshan. Reporters delivered comprehensive reports on practicing thrift to workers at various construction sites. Workers began to expose the long-standing serious waste phenomena in the construction departments. Most construction departments have also identified the main problems of waste in their respective units.
    The waste material recovery work carried out by the vast number of workers has achieved preliminary results. As of June 10th, they had collected more than 7,000 tons of scrap steel and paid attention to utilizing the waste materials. The first engineering team of the Metal Structure Installation Engineering Company recovered 2,800 kilograms of screws, of which more than 2,000 kilograms have been repaired and reused. Workers have also developed many methods to save funds. For example, after the automobile brigade promoted the advanced method of driving automobiles by driver Zhang Shimin, it saved nine tons of gasoline in one month. (Xinhua News Agency)
  Shanghai Power Plant Applies Experience in Saving Coal
    Two major power plants in Shanghai are applying the advanced experience of Shanghai model worker Hua Wanfu in saving coal. After adopting this experience, several boilers at the Yangshupu Power Plant have saved more than 20 tons of coal per boiler in the first five months of this year. After adopting this experience, the coal consumption per kilowatt-hour generated in April and May by the joint state-private Zhabei Power Plant has been lower than the national standard. Just by increasing the boiler thermal efficiency alone, the entire plant can save at least 2,000 to 3,000 tons of coal per year.
    Hua Wanfu is a stoker at the Yangshupu Power Plant. When operating, he often inspects the operation of the furnace by following a certain route and meticulously understands the combustion situation of the furnace through various instruments. He tries to open the furnace's air doors and fire doors as little as possible to facilitate the full utilization of the coal's heat energy. The combustible material remaining in the furnace ash of the boiler he operates is only about 5% after testing, and the heat utilization rate is often maintained at about 88%. Now, the leaders of the Yangshupu Power Plant have summarized Hua Wanfu's coal-burning experience. (Xinhua News Agency)
  State-Owned Factories and Mines in Tonghua Area Practice Thrift
    Workers of state-owned factories and mines in the Tonghua area of Jilin Province are actively carrying out activities to practice thrift and recover waste metal and raw materials. According to statistics from four units, including Tonghua Shiren Coal Mine, Tiechang Coal Mine, Zhazi Pit Coal Mine, and Erdaojiang Drilling Machine Repair Factory, since April, they have organized 40 youth thrift teams with more than 1,300 members. The six youth thrift teams of Tonghua Shiren Coal Mine recovered more than 53,000 jin of waste metal and more than 5,000 jin of pit wood in a very short time, many of which can be used. The 13th youth tunneling team of the 5th pit of this mine also saved 210 jin of gunpowder and more than 300 detonators in May. The 18 thrift teams of the Erdaojiang Drilling Machine Repair Factory recovered more than 20,000 jin of steel and saved more than 4,000 jin of wood and oil in just over ten days. Many young people in this factory are also actively trying to improve production efficiency. Lin Kuiran, Wang Zhiyi, Liu Guangwu and other workers in the mechanical workshop produced no defective products in making "thick-skinned joints" in May, and the daily output also increased from 16 to 34. The 14 thrift teams of Tiechang Coal Mine have more than 780 members. From June 1st to 10th, they recovered more than 106,000 jin of waste metal and other materials, including 38,000 jin of usable semi-finished products. Workers at Qidaogou Iron Mine and Dalizi Iron Mine also recovered a lot of scrap steel. (Collective Correspondent of this newspaper, Jilin Daily Editorial Department)
  Beijing Freight Trucks Converted to Gasifier Vehicles
    Among the freight trucks of the Beijing Automotive Transportation Company, 34 gasoline vehicles have recently been converted into gasifier vehicles. These vehicles use coal as fuel, and one vehicle can save more than 49 kilograms of gasoline per day. By the end of June, the company will have converted a total of 100 gasifier vehicles. From July to the end of the year, these gasifier vehicles can save the country more than 314,000 kilograms of gasoline.
    The driving condition of the gasifier vehicles converted by the Beijing Automotive Transportation Company is very good. For more than a month, the vehicle operation rate has averaged 70%, which is close to the operation rate of gasoline vehicles. The daily mileage of 70% of gasifier vehicles has exceeded that of gasoline vehicles. The gasifier vehicle driven by driver Ying Qi traveled 228 kilometers on June 1st, setting the highest record for daily mileage of freight gasoline vehicles in Beijing. Driver Sun Chuanhao learned the technology of driving gasifier vehicles in three days.
    In order to adapt to the new technical requirements after the automobile conversion, the company has formulated operating regulations for gasifier vehicles. Experienced drivers and technicians have also formed a technical core group to impart driving methods and maintenance methods. (Xinhua News Agency)
  Shijiazhuang and Other Cities Deepen Grain Conservation
    Grain conservation work is deepening in cities such as Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou in Hebei Province. Each district in Shijiazhuang held grain conservation exhibitions in late May, and more than 85% of households in the city have revised their grain purchase plans. Around June 10th, each district held grain conservation representative conferences to commend advanced figures, promote grain conservation experience, and expose the phenomenon of grain waste.
    Organizations, groups, and grain supply and processing departments in Qinhuangdao City have successively held meetings to summarize the achievements in grain conservation in the previous period and deploy future work. The city's leading authorities plan to hold a city-wide grain conservation exhibition and a city-wide grain conservation representative conference in late June. (Xinhua News Agency)

    从各方面为国家节约财富
    国营电力工业将节约建设投资四千多万元
    全国国营电力工业在不减低工程进度和保证工程质量的基础上，今年将节约基本建设投资四千五百万元。这个节约数字，是燃料工业部电业管理总局在六月十六日到二十日召开的全国电业基本建设会议上确定的。
    参加会议的各地代表，在讨论了国务院副总理李富春关于“厉行节约，为完成社会主义建设而奋斗”的报告后，着重检查了电力工业基本建设中非生产性和生产附属建筑标准要求过高、设计和施工中的浪费现象。会议规定全国电力工业系统，凡是没有开工的工程将一律按照中央规定的标准修建。办公室的平均造价从每平方公尺一百多元降低为六十元，宿舍每平方公尺从七十多元降低到四十元。经过计算，仅办公室和宿舍等非生产性建筑工程，下半年就可以节省投资四百五十多万元。电业管理总局所属新建太原和石家庄热电厂等建设单位，准备把工地上八千多平方公尺的临时建筑物改为职工永久宿舍，并计划削减一些可以缓建的更衣室、医务室等项目。预计这些措施实行后，可以节省二万多平方公尺面积的房屋建设费用。
     会议还提出了设计和施工管理等方面的节约措施。据初步计算，各设计单位仅在选用材料、设备和正确计算系数标准等方面，今年就可节约工程总造价九百万元。各施工单位经过改进施工管理、克服材料浪费和合理调整劳动组织后，今年也可节约八百多万元的施工费用。过去，华北、华东等电业设计分局在设计高压电线时，曾用钢筋混凝土电线杆代替铁塔，每条线路都可节省三分之一的费用，并保证了工程质量。现在，各设计单位准备把所有的线路重新审查，规定凡能改的一律改为钢筋混凝土电线杆。（新华社）
    对外贸易部降低工程造价
    对外贸易部重新审核了今年的基本建设计划；经初步计算可以比原计划节省二百五十万元以上。
    对外贸易部原计划的各项工程，因为没有统一投资定额标准，一般单位造价都有偏高现象。成都土产出口公司仓库，原计划每平方公尺九十一元，实际只需要五十到六十元。天津新河粮谷油脂出口公司仓库，因为防火需要，原要求钢木屋架，每平方公尺造价一百元，现在减少钢材，同样能用，造价可以降低为七十三元。广东客奇丝绸公司仓库，每平方公尺造价原定六十四元，而实际上只需四十五元。这些造价偏高的现象，都作了修正。
    原计划中，有些附属工程的造价也高出很多。如汉口土产出口公司仓库的厕所，原计划每平方公尺造价八十五元；天津土产出口公司大麻加工厂的厕所，每平方公尺竟达一百元。这些不合理现象也都作了修正。一般零星工程和零星购置的投资也加以缩减，约可节省五十万元。
    对外贸易部一九五五年初曾经为基本建设投资太少、不足分配，要求中央追加，经这次计算以后，不仅不需要追加，原计划所需的资金还可以节省上缴。（广溪、佩仪）
  鞍山各工地开展群众性节约
    鞍山的各个建设工地上正在开展群众性的厉行节约、反对浪费的工作。报告员们到各工地向职工作了全面厉行节约的报告。职工们开始揭发建设部门长期存在的严重浪费现象。大部分建设部门，也已发现了本单位浪费方面的主要问题。
    广大职工进行的废料回收工作已获得初步成绩。到六月十日止，他们共收集了七千多吨废钢铁，并注意把废料利用起来。金属结构安装工程公司第一工程队回收的二千八百公斤螺丝，经过修理已有二千多公斤重新使用。职工们还研究出许多节约资金的方法。如汽车大队推广司机张世民驾驶汽车先进方法后，一个月就节省九吨汽油。（新华社）
  上海电厂运用节约燃煤经验
    上海市两个主要的发电厂正在运用上海市劳动模范花万富先进的节约燃煤经验。杨树浦发电厂的几台锅炉在采用了这一经验后，今年头五个月中每台锅炉都节约了二十多吨煤。公私合营闸北发电厂采用这一经验后，四五两月每发一度电所消耗的煤，已低于国家规定的指标。只是提高锅炉热效率一项，全厂一年内至少可以节约二三千吨煤。
    花万富是杨树浦发电厂的司炉工人。他操作时，经常是按照一定的路线，巡回检查炉子的运转，并细致地通过各种仪表了解炉子的燃烧情况，尽量少开炉子上的风门、火门，便于充分利用煤的热能。他操作的那台锅炉，炉灰里剩下的可燃物经化验只有百分之五左右，热的利用率也经常保持在百分之八十八左右。现在，杨树浦发电厂的领导方面已经总结了花万富的烧煤经验。（新华社）
  通化地区国营厂矿厉行节约
    吉林省通化地区国营厂矿职工积极展开厉行节约、收回废金属和原材料的活动。据通化石人煤矿、铁厂煤矿、砟子坑煤矿、二道江钻机修配厂等四个单位的统计，从四月份到现在已经组织起四十个青年节约队，拥有一千三百多名队员。通化石人煤矿的六个青年节约队，在很短时间内就收回废金属五万三千多斤、坑木五千多斤，其中有很多器材可以使用。这个矿第五坑青年掘进第十三组，在五月份还节省了火药二百一十斤、雷管三百多个。二道江钻机修配厂的十八个节约队，十几天就收回钢铁两万多斤，节省木材、油脂四千多斤。这个厂的许多青年们还积极设法提高生产效率。机械车间林奎然、王志义、刘光武等工人，五月份做“厚皮接头”没有出一个废品，日产量也由十六个提高到三十四个。铁厂煤矿的十四个节约队有七百八十多名队员。他们从六月一日到十日，收回废金属等器材十万零六千多斤，其中包括能使用的半成品三万八千多斤。七道沟铁矿和大栗子铁矿的职工也都收回很多废钢材。（本报集体通讯员吉林日报编辑部）
  北京货运汽车改为煤气炉车
    北京市汽车运输公司的货运汽车中，最近出现了三十四部用汽油车改装的煤气炉车。这种车用煤作燃料，一辆车一天能节省四十九公斤多汽油。到六月底，这个公司共要改装成一百部煤气炉车。这些煤气炉车从七月到年底，可为国家节省汽油三十一万四千多公斤。
    北京市汽车运输公司改装的煤气炉车的行驶情况很好。一个多月来，出车率平均达到百分之七十，已接近汽油车的出车率。百分之七十的煤气炉车的车日行程超过了汽油车。司机英启驾驶的煤气炉车，六月一日行驶二百二十八公里，创造了北京市货运汽油车车日行程的最高纪录。司机孙传浩三天就学会了驾驶煤气炉车的技术。
    为了适应汽车改装后对技术上的新要求，这个公司制定了煤气炉车的操作规程。有经验的司机和技术人员，并成立了技术核心组，传授驾驶方法和保养方法。（新华社）
  石家庄等城市深入节约粮食
    河北省石家庄、唐山、张家口等城市粮食节约工作正深入开展。石家庄市各区在五月下旬分别举办了节约粮食展览会，全市已有百分之八十五以上的住户修订了购粮计划。六月十日左右，各区又召开了节约粮食代表会，表扬先进人物，推广节约粮食的经验，同时揭发浪费粮食的现象。
    秦皇岛市的机关、团体和粮食供应、加工等部门，陆续召开了会议，总结前一时期节约粮食的成绩，布置今后工作。市的领导机关计划在六月下旬举办全市节约粮食展览会，并召开全市节约粮食代表大会。（新华社）
