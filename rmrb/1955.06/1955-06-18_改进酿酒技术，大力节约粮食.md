Improve Brewing Technology, Vigorously Save Grain
　　Liu Xi

Since the beginning of this year, the brewing industry in Guiding Special District, Guizhou Province, has adopted various methods to increase the wine yield and save a large amount of grain. Their overall goal is to reduce grain usage by 13.3 percent, saving the country two million catties of grain per year.

This special district has a total of 189 local state-owned, cooperative-run, and privately-owned brewing workshops, most of which brew corn liquor. The brewing technology of these workshops is very backward. In the past, there were no specific scientific standards for the size of the fire and the high or low temperature during the processes of steaming grain, saccharification, and fermentation. The operation methods were also extremely inconsistent. The grain was steamed unevenly, sometimes raw and sometimes overcooked, and the phenomenon of liquor not being produced when it should be, or liquor being produced before the proper time, often occurred. Therefore, the wine yield of these workshops was very low. In 1954, the average grain consumption for 100 catties of 45-proof liquor was as high as 227 catties and 4 taels. The total sales volume of liquor in the special district is about seven million catties, so you can imagine how much grain was wasted in brewing.

In order to increase the wine yield, in October last year, the Industry Section of the Guiding Special Commissioner's Office sent people to key wineries to organize technical exchanges, and sent workers to attend brewing technology exchange meetings held in Southwest China and Guizhou Province to learn advanced brewing experience from other regions. This year, the Special Commissioner's Office and the county people's governments have successively held brewing technology research and exchange meetings, using methods such as giving theoretical lessons on brewing technology, live demonstrations, and organizing visits, to exchange brewing experience. At the technical exchange meeting held by the Special Commissioner's Office, worker representatives from the Qingyu Winery in Zhenyuan Special District were also invited to give technical demonstrations. State-owned wineries also established brewing technology research groups to exchange and promote brewing experience from their own factories and other places.

There is also a key technical problem in various wineries: due to unpredictable climate changes, the temperature of the top, bottom, sides, and center of the boxes and barrels during saccharification (the temperature of the grain) is different, and there are many "cold seeds" (unsaccharified grain is called "cold seeds"), which greatly affects the output and quality of the liquor. In order to solve this problem, the Weng'an County Local State-Owned Winery put forward the slogan of eliminating "cold seeds" and saving the country 210,000 catties of grain a year. The workers of this factory put forward seven rationalization proposals around this issue. After research and discussion, the factory leadership adopted the suggestion of burying the boxes and barrels underground. The test results proved that using this method, because the semi-finished products in the box were not affected by the sudden changes in the external climate, it was easy to control the temperature, eliminate about 20 percent of the "cold seeds", and greatly increase the wine yield. After the success of this method, the factory promoted it, and the Special Commissioner's Office and some counties also organized workers from various wineries to visit and learn. Now most of the local state-owned wineries in this special district have adopted this method. In order to improve operations, many wineries have purchased thermometers and stipulated the temperature and time for steaming, saccharification, and fermentation, initially unifying the operation methods. With the improvement of technology, many wineries have improved labor organization and increased brewing efficiency.

In terms of trying out substitutes, some wineries in this special district tried more than a dozen substitutes such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, corn stalks, and kudzu roots last year. In early June of this year, the Guiding Special Commissioner's Office sent two working groups to various factories to summarize the experience of using substitutes to brew liquor, and further clarified the issues of output, variety, price, and technical conditions, preparing to officially start using some substitutes to brew liquor at the end of the third quarter of this year.

In order to ensure the completion of the saving task, the factories conducted education for workers on calculating "waste accounts" and "loss accounts," enhancing workers' awareness of saving. In the first quarter of this year, the average grain consumption per 100 catties of 45-proof liquor was reduced by more than 21 catties compared with last year, and the entire special district saved a total of more than 338,400 catties of grain. Through the efforts of the workers, the grain consumption of various wineries in April and May has been further reduced.

    改进酿酒技术，大力节约粮食
    刘希
    自今年年初以来，贵州省贵定专区的酿酒业，采取各种方法提高了出酒率和节约了大批粮食。他们的总的目标是要降低粮食使用量百分之十三点三，一年为国家节约二百万斤粮食。
    这个专区共有地方国营、合作社营和私营的酿酒作坊一百八十九个，大都是酿的苞谷酒。这些作坊的酿酒技术都很落后，蒸煮粮食、糖化、发酵等过程中的火力大小，温度高低，过去都没有一定科学的标准。操作方法也极不一致，粮食蒸煮不均匀，有生有熟，该出酒时不出酒，不到出酒时间出了酒的现象时常发生。因此这些作坊的出酒率都很低，一百斤四十五度的酒，一九五四年平均用粮量高达二百二十七斤四两。全专区酒的销售量是七百万斤左右，可以想像在酿酒中浪费的粮食是很多的。
    为了提高出酒率，去年十月，贵定专署工业科派人到重点酒厂组织了技术交流，并派工人出席了西南和贵州省召开的酿酒技术交流会，学习了外区先进的酿酒经验。今年，专署和各县县人民政府又先后分别召开了酿酒技术研究会和交流会，通过上酿酒技术理论课、现场表演、组织参观等方法，交流了酿酒经验。在专署召开的技术交流会上，还邀请了镇远专区庆余酒厂的工人代表作技术表演。各国营酒厂还成立了酿酒技术研究小组，交流和推广本厂和外地的酿酒经验。
    各酒厂在技术方面还有这样一个关键问题，由于气候变化不定，酿酒糖化时，箱、桶上下四周和中央的品温（粮食的温度）冷热不同，“冷籽”多（未糖化的粮食叫“冷籽”），对酒的产量、质量影响很大。为了解决这一问题，瓮安县地方国营酒厂提出了消灭“冷籽”、一年为国家节约二十一万斤粮食的口号。这个厂的工人围绕这个问题提了七件合理化建议，经过研究讨论，厂的领导方面采纳了把箱、桶埋到地下的建议。试验结果证明，采用这个办法，由于箱内的半成品不受外界气候忽冷忽热的影响，易于掌握品温，消灭了约占百分之二十的“冷籽”，大大提高了出酒率。这一办法试验成功后，厂里就加以推广，专署和有些县还组织了各酒厂的工人前去参观、学习。现在这个专区大部分的地方国营酒厂都采用了这一办法。为了改进操作，不少酒厂都买了温度表，规定了蒸煮、糖化、发酵的温度和时间，初步统一了操作方法。随着技术上的改进，许多酒厂改进了劳动组织，提高了酿酒的效率。
    在试用代用品方面，这个专区去年有些酒厂试用过甘薯、马铃薯、苞谷秸、橛根等十几种代用品。贵定专署在今年六月初派出了两个工作组，到各厂总结试用代用品酿酒的经验，进一步摸清了产量、品种、价格、技术条件等方面的问题，准备在今年第三季度末正式开始使用部分代用品酿酒。
    为了保证节约任务的完成，各厂对工人进行了算“浪费账”、“损失账”的教育，增强了工人的节约观念。今年第一季度每百斤四十五度酒的平均用粮量，比去年降低了二十一斤多，全专区共节约了粮食三十三万八千四百多斤。经过工人的努力，四、五月份各酒厂的用粮量又有所减少。
