    An Important Step to Strengthen Leadership in Scientific Work
    The inaugural meeting of the academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences opened in Beijing on June 1st. Through this meeting, the Chinese Academy of Sciences will establish four academic divisions, namely the Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry; the Division of Biology and Earth Sciences; the Division of Technological Sciences; and the Division of Philosophy and Social Sciences, to lead scientific research work in their respective disciplines. This is a very important step in promoting China's scientific work.
    The Chinese Academy of Sciences is the highest academic institution in the country, responsible for the important task of leading and promoting the nation's scientific endeavors. In the past few years, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has done much work and achieved certain results in adjusting old scientific institutions, establishing and developing a scientific workforce, helping scientists conduct self-ideological education, and organizing scientists to participate in national construction. These efforts were necessary measures to ensure the development of scientific undertakings in New China. However, it cannot be denied that the Chinese Academy of Sciences still lacks strong organization and leadership over the entire scientific enterprise in our country. With the development of China's socialist construction, the state's demands for scientific work are becoming increasingly urgent, thus further strengthening the leadership of scientific work has become a matter of urgency. Scientific work has its own characteristics. In addition to doing general political and ideological leadership and administrative management, the Chinese Academy of Sciences must establish strong academic leadership based on the characteristics of scientific work itself. To this end, it is necessary to promote academic democracy and absorb outstanding Chinese scientists to participate in the leadership of scientific undertakings. The purpose of establishing the academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences lies here.
    Strengthening the planning of scientific work is an important part of academic leadership. The state's planned construction requires scientific work to cooperate in a planned way. China's scientific foundation is weak, and its strength is limited. It is especially important to organize forces in areas that are most beneficial to national construction and most effective in promoting scientific development, and to avoid duplication of work and waste of manpower. It is very necessary that the inaugural meeting of the academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has listed the discussion of the work outline of the Chinese Academy of Sciences during the first five-year plan as a major task of the meeting. This inaugural meeting of the academic divisions will be a good beginning for scientists to use their expertise to actively participate in the formulation of scientific development plans.
    Scientific research must be carried out under the guidance of correct ideology. Only by展开 different opinions of struggle,展开 on the wrong viewpoints of criticism, scientific undertakings can develop forward. In the past, the academic discussion atmosphere in China's scientific community was not active enough, erroneous academic views were not exposed and criticized in time, and disputes over different opinions were not well展开d, thus hindering the progress of scientific work. It was not until the criticism of Hu Shi's and Hu Feng's reactionary academic thoughts began in October last year that a great change took place in the atmosphere of the academic community. This criticism movement has had a wide and profound impact on China's academic community. After the establishment of the academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, they should further do a good job in organizing and leading academic criticism and discussion in various academic fields on this basis.
    At present, China's scientific team is still very small, and it is far from meeting the needs of the country, whether in terms of quantity or quality. Therefore, cultivating new forces and expanding the scientific team is one of the most important links in the current scientific work, especially the enrichment of certain important and weak scientific departments, and we must first start by vigorously training cadres. Every scientist should be closely concerned about the growth of new forces, regard the training of cadres as their glorious responsibility, and pass on their knowledge to the next generation as much as possible so that they can grow up quickly. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has now formulated a graduate student system, which will begin to recruit graduate students after being approved by the government. The academic divisions should actively lead the research institutions to train graduate students, and take all effective measures to promote the continuous improvement of the academic level of scientific workers. The establishment of a degree system and an academician system is of great significance for establishing academic standards and promoting scientific progress. The Chinese Academy of Sciences should, on the basis of the establishment of the academic divisions, work with relevant departments to actively carry out preparatory work.
    The establishment of the academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences reflects the further unity of Chinese scientists. In the past few years, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has achieved certain results in implementing the policy of uniting scientists put forward by the Party and the government. However, it has not done enough in maximizing the enthusiasm and creativity of scientists and relying on scientists to do scientific work well. Now, more than 200 outstanding scientists from all over the country with rich expertise have begun to stand on the leading positions of China's scientific undertakings. This huge force is united, closely connected with the national scientific community, and works together for the development of the motherland's scientific undertakings. Unremitting efforts will make the face of China's scientific work new.
    The socialist construction of our motherland urgently needs to develop scientific undertakings, and the people of the whole country have great expectations for scientific work. We believe that our scientists will be able to actively发挥 their wisdom and achieve greater achievements in various scientific fields, and gloriously complete the tasks assigned to them by the country and the people.

### 加强科学工作领导的重要步骤

    加强科学工作领导的重要步骤
    中国科学院学部成立大会已于六月一日在北京开幕了。通过这次大会，中国科学院将建立起四个学部，即物理学数学化学部、生物学地学部、技术科学部、哲学社会科学部，分工领导各学科的科学研究工作。这是推进我国科学工作的一个非常重要的步骤。
    中国科学院是国家最高的学术机关，它负有领导和推进全国科学事业的重大任务。在过去几年中，中国科学院在调整旧有科学机构，建立和发展科学工作队伍，帮助科学家进行自我思想教育，组织科学家参加祖国建设等方面，做了不少工作，也取得了一定的成绩。这些工作都是保证新中国科学事业发展所必须采取的措施。但是不能否认，中国科学院对我国整个科学事业还缺乏有力的组织和领导。随着我国社会主义建设事业的发展，国家对科学工作的要求日益迫切，因此进一步加强科学工作的领导便成为刻不容缓的事情了。科学工作有它本身的特点。中国科学院除了要做好一般的政治思想领导和行政管理工作外，就必须根据科学工作本身的特点，树立坚强的学术领导。为此就必须发扬学术民主，必须吸收我国优秀的科学家来参加科学事业的领导工作。中国科学院成立各学部的目的就在这里。
    加强科学工作的计划性是学术领导的一个重要的内容。国家有计划的建设要求科学工作有计划地配合。我国科学工作的基础薄弱，力量有限，怎样把力量组织到对国家建设最有利，对科学发展最起作用的地方，避免工作重复、人力浪费，是尤其重要的。这次中国科学院召开的学部成立大会把讨论第一个五年计划期间中国科学院的工作纲要列为会议的一项主要任务，这是很必要的。这次学部成立大会将是科学家们运用自己的专门知识，积极参加科学发展计划的制定工作的一个良好的开端。
    科学研究工作必须在正确的思想指导下进行。只有展开不同意见的争论，展开对错误观点的批判，科学事业才能向前发展。过去，我国科学界的学术讨论风气是不够活跃的，错误的学术观点没有及时得到揭发和批判，不同意见的争论没有很好地展开，因而妨碍了科学工作的进展。直到去年十月开始对胡适、胡风反动学术思想的批判以来，学术界的风气才发生了很大的转变。这一批判运动在中国的学术界产生了广泛而深刻的影响。中国科学院各学部成立后应该在这个基础上面，进一步做好组织和领导各学术领域中学术批评和讨论的工作。
    目前我国科学队伍还很小，无论从数量上或质量上来说，都远不能满足国家的需要。因此，培养新生力量、扩大科学队伍是当前科学工作最重要的环节之一，特别是某些重要而薄弱的科学部门的充实，首先要从大力培养干部着手。每一位科学家都应当密切关怀新生力量的成长，要把培养干部看作自己的光荣职责，尽量把自己的知识传授给下一代，使他们迅速地成长起来。中国科学院现在制定了研究生制度，经政府批准后即开始招收研究生。各学部应积极领导各研究机构对研究生的培养工作，并采取一切有效措施，促进科学工作人员不断提高学术水平。建立学位制度和院士制度对于树立学术标准、推动科学前进具有很大的意义，中国科学院应在学部成立的基础上会同有关部门，积极进行准备工作。
    中国科学院学部的成立体现了我国科学家进一步的团结。过去几年里，中国科学院执行党和政府所提出的团结科学家的政策是有一定的成绩的。但是在使科学家发挥最大积极性、创造性，依靠科学家做好科学工作方面，还做得不够。现在，来自全国各方面的二百多位具有丰富专门知识的优秀科学家，开始站到了中国科学事业的领导岗位上来了，这一个巨大的力量团结起来，密切联系全国科学界，共同为祖国科学事业的发展而不懈地努力，将会使我国科学工作的面貌为之一新。
    我们祖国的社会主义建设迫切需要发展科学事业，全国人民对科学工作所怀的期望是极大的。我们相信，我国的科学家们一定能够积极地发挥自己的智慧，在各个科学领域中获得更大的成就，光荣地完成国家和人民交给他们的任务。
