Xinhua News Agency, June 25th dispatch from Moscow: TASS reported on June 25th that newspapers in London and Paris published detailed reports on Molotov's speech at the United Nations Commemorative Session.

    London newspapers' headlines generally emphasized that the Soviet Union had put forward a peace plan. All newspapers emphasized the plan for easing international tension proposed by Molotov.

      The "Daily Mail's" San Francisco correspondent highlighted the following passage from Molotov's speech: Since the Soviet Union has fully accepted the Western countries' proposals on conventional armaments and has approached their views on the issue of atomic weapons, "now it is up to the United States and other Western countries." The "News Chronicle" emphasized that Molotov's suggestion for convening a world economic conference deserves special attention.

    The "Daily Herald's" editorial said, "Molotov in San Francisco gave us a hopeful preview of what might happen at the Four Powers conference in Geneva next month." The editorial said that the British government must make full use of this "best chance for peace" that seems to be available.

    A BBC correspondent at the United Nations said that Molotov received more applause than any other representative who has spoken at the meeting so far, and this applause did not only come from "Communist countries."

    However, Molotov's speech did not please those who oppose a policy based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and mutual trust between countries with different social and political systems, and who advocate a "position of strength" policy. The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" expressed the views of these people, attempting to portray Molotov's speech as a propaganda stunt.

    In Paris, "Combat" said that Molotov's words on the necessity of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations are in the interests of "the majority of the members of this organization." "Combat" concluded: "Molotov's proposals deserve to be treated with approval."

      "Liberation" said that the plan proposed by the Soviet Foreign Minister, as long as there is goodwill and mutual trust, "nothing is impossible to implement." The newspaper said, "To negotiate 'from a position of strength,' demanding unilateral concessions—this means cherishing illusions and causing the failure of the negotiations."

    Xinhua News Agency, June 25th dispatch from New York: TASS reported from New York that Molotov's speech at the United Nations Commemorative Session left a deep impression on American public opinion. Donovan, the "New York Herald Tribune's" correspondent in San Francisco, reported: "The audience liked his conciliatory and friendly speech. ... His speech was interrupted by applause five times."

    American newspapers cannot deny the importance of Molotov's speech and the suggestions he made in it. The "New York Times" pointed out in an editorial that the "factual evidence" of Molotov's speech "is the Soviet Union's recent demonstration of a peaceful stance and the concessions it has made in facilitating a great power summit." The editorial said that this speech is "welcome." The "New York Herald Tribune's" editorial pointed out that the Soviet delegation leader's speech "was awaited with great interest by everyone" and said that "it should now be studied word by word."

    Murray Kempton, a commentator for the "New York Post," wrote that the system for supervising arms reduction, as elaborated by Molotov in his speech, "makes it possible for the United Nations to escape from the impasse it is now in on the issue of supervision." The newspaper's editorial said: If Americans underestimate the "potential appeal" of Molotov's speech, they are deceiving themselves, because "in Asia, few people support the US's position on the Chiang Kai-shek issue; and in Europe, millions of people, including the best elements of Germany after the collapse of Hitler, are afraid of German rearmament." The editorial said: "It would be unwise if we (i.e., the United States—TASS editor) answered" the Soviet proposals "in a hard-line tone."

    At the same time, the proposals in Molotov's speech aimed at easing international tensions have also aroused anger, resentment, and fear among some people in the United States, and this is also reflected in the newspapers. Some commentators and reporters intend to slander every word of the Soviet delegation leader's speech.

    It can be seen from the newspapers that the reason why some people in the United States who do not want to ease international tensions are enraged is that the Soviet delegation leader clearly analyzed the causes of the tensions and put forward a plan that the Soviet delegation believes can restore trust between countries and strengthen peace. These people do not dare to openly oppose the principles of coexistence and peaceful cooperation, but they hope to limit themselves to verbally acknowledging these principles, while actually continuing to implement their policies that create tensions. For example, as can be seen from the "New York Times" editorial, the United States only agrees to "peace" based on a "position of strength" policy. The newspaper denies all the suggestions made in Molotov's speech outright.

### 英法美三国舆论重视莫洛托夫的演说

    英法美三国舆论重视莫洛托夫的演说
    据新华社二十五日讯  据塔斯社二十五日讯：伦敦和巴黎的报纸都刊载了关于莫洛托夫在联合国纪念会上的演说的详尽报道。
    伦敦报纸的标题一般都着重指出苏联已经提出了一个和平方案。各报都强调指出莫洛托夫提出的缓和国际紧张局势计划。
      “每日邮报”驻旧金山记者着重指出了莫洛托夫演说中这一段：既然苏联已经完全接受了西方国家关于常规军备的建议并且在原子武器问题上也接近了它们的意见，“现在就看美国和其他西方国家怎样了”。“新闻纪事报”强调说，莫洛托夫关于召开世界经济会议的建议是值得特别注意的。
    “每日先驱报”的社论说，“莫洛托夫在旧金山使我们看到了关于下个月日内瓦四大国会议时可能发生的事情的一次充满希望的预演。社论说，英国政府必须充分利用这个看起来是“和平的最好的机会”。
    英国广播公司驻联合国记者说，莫洛托夫所获得的掌声比至今为止在会上发言的任何其他代表为多，这些掌声不仅来自“共产党国家”。
    不过，莫洛托夫的演说没有使这样一些人高兴，这些人反对以不同社会和政治制度的国家和平共处和互相信任的原则为基础的政策，而主张采取“实力地位”政策。“每日电讯与晨邮报”代表这些人发表了意见，它企图把莫洛托夫的演说说成是一种宣传行动。
    在巴黎，“战斗报”说，莫洛托夫关于必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利的话，是符合“这个组织的多数会员国”的利益的。“战斗报”最后说：“莫洛托夫的建议值得得到赞同的对待”。
      “解放报”说，苏联外交部长提出的计划，只要有善意和相互的信任，“没有不可实行的东西”。这家报纸说，“从实力地位出发”来进行谈判，要求单方面的让步——这都意味着怀着幻想并使谈判失败。
    据新华社二十五日讯  据塔斯社纽约讯：莫洛托夫在联合国纪念会上的演说，给美国舆论界留下了很深的印象。“纽约先驱论坛报”驻旧金山记者杜诺万报道说：“听众很喜欢他的和解的、友好的发言。……他的演说曾经五次为掌声所打断。”
    美国报纸无法否认莫洛托夫的演说和他在演说中提出的建议的重要性。“纽约时报”在社论中指出，莫洛托夫的讲话“的事实证据是苏联最近表现的和平姿态以及它在促成大国高级会议方面所作的让步”。社论说，这篇演说是“值得欢迎的”。“纽约先驱论坛报”社论指出，苏联代表团团长的发言“是大家很关心地期待着的”，并说“现在应该对它逐字逐句地研究”。
    “纽约邮报”评论员拉希写道，莫洛托夫在演说中所阐述的监督裁减军备的制度，“使得联合国有可能摆脱现在在监督问题上所处的绝境”。这家报纸的社论说：如果美国人低估了莫洛托夫演说的“潜在的吸引力”，他们就是自己欺骗自己，因为“在亚洲很少人支持美国在蒋介石问题上所采取的立场；而在欧洲，千百万的人，其中包括希特勒垮台之后的德国的优秀力量，害怕德国重新武装起来”。社论说：“如果我们（即美国——塔斯社编者）以死硬的口吻答复”苏联的建议，“那是不明智的”。
    同时，在莫洛托夫发言中提出的目的在于和缓国际紧张局势的建议也引起了美国某些人士的激怒、愤恨和恐惧，这在报纸上也反映了出来。有些评论员和记者打算对苏联代表团团长发言中的每个字都加以诽谤。
    从报纸上可以看出，美国某些不希望和缓国际紧张局势的人之所以激怒，是因为苏联代表团团长清楚地分析了产生紧张局势的原因，提出了苏联代表团认为能够恢复各国之间的信任和加强和平的计划。这些人不敢公开地来反对共处和和平合作的原则，但是，他们希望能只限于口头上承认这些原则，而实际上继续执行他们那种造成紧张局势的政策。譬如，从“纽约时报”的社论中可以看出，美国只同意以“实力地位”政策为基础的“和平”。这家报纸对莫洛托夫演说中提出的一切建议都一概加以否定。
