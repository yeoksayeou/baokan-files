    Xinhua News Agency, London, June 6th: British railway workers, dockworkers, and sailors are continuing their strikes, demanding higher wages and improved working conditions.
    The strike of 70,000 locomotive drivers and stokers has persisted for nine days, while the dockworkers' strike has entered its third week.
    On the evening of the 5th, British Prime Minister Eden delivered his second broadcast since the railway workers began their strike. In his speech, Eden deliberately distorted the cause of the railway workers' strike, while repeatedly demanding that the striking workers abandon their reasonable demands.

    英政府对罢工工人施加压力
    新华社六日讯　伦敦消息：英国的铁路工人、码头工人和海员在继续罢工，他们要求提高工资和改善工作条件。
    七万个机车司机和司炉工人的罢工已经坚持了九天，码头工人的罢工则已经进入了第三周。
    五日晚上，英国首相艾登作了从铁路工人开始罢工以来的第二次广播演说。在演说中，艾登故意歪曲这次铁路工人罢工的起因，同时一再要求罢工工人放弃他们的合理要求。
