Increasing Melon Seed Production to Exchange for Machinery
Yu Lihong

There are three types of melon seeds produced in our country: Dagua seeds, watermelon seeds, and pumpkin seeds. According to color, there are black melon seeds, white melon seeds, and red melon seeds. Black melon seeds are most abundant in Hebei, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan provinces, and Inner Mongolia. White melon seeds are most famous from Shanxi province. Red melon seeds are most well-known from Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces.

The production of melon seeds is generally a rural sideline, but in some areas, it is the main source of livelihood. For example, in Wuyuan and Baotou in Inner Mongolia, land for planting melons accounts for about 30 percent of the total cultivated area. In Jiangxi Province, the annual total value of melon seed production accounts for about 0.4 percent of farmers' total income.

Melon seeds are one of China's perennial export commodities. From 1950 to 1954, the melon seeds exported from the whole country could be exchanged for 563 fifty-four horsepower tractors.

Since exporting melon seeds has a significant effect on the country's industrial construction, we should use idle land such as rural houses and field edges to increase the production of various melon seeds. If each farmer in Shanxi Province plants an additional ten pumpkin plants, the annual output of white melon seeds can be increased by 7.5 million jin. Farmers throughout the province can increase their income by 2.25 million yuan, which will greatly improve the lives of farmers. To increase the export volume of melon seeds, in addition to striving to increase production, we must also save on the consumption of melon seeds.

Since melon seed production areas are scattered, commercial departments and cooperatives in various places also need to organize rural peddlers to do a good job of purchasing.

    增产瓜子换回机器
    禹理洪
    我国所产的瓜子有打瓜子、西瓜子、南瓜子三种。按色泽分有黑瓜子、白瓜子、红瓜子三种。黑瓜子以河北、江西、山东、河南等省和内蒙古出产最多。白瓜子以山西省出产的最为有名。红瓜子以江西、广东、广西等省出产最著名。
    生产瓜子一般都为农村副业，但部分地区也有以它为主要生活来源的，如内蒙古的五原、包头等地种瓜土地约占耕地总面积百分之三十，江西省瓜子每年生产总值约占农民总收入百分之零点四。
      瓜子是我国常年外销物资之一，一九五○年至一九五四年全国对外输出的瓜子可换回五十四匹马力的拖拉机五百六十三部。
    出口瓜子既然对国家工业建设有很大的作用，我们就应当利用农村中的屋舍、田边等闲地增加各种瓜子的生产，如果山西省每家农户多种十棵南瓜，全年即可增产白瓜子七百五十万斤，全省农民可增加二百二十五万元的收入，这对改善农民生活将起很大作用。为了增加瓜子输出量，除了努力增加生产外，还要节省瓜子的消费量。
    由于瓜子产地零星分散，还需要各地商业部门和合作社组织农村小商贩做好收购工作。
