Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: Vice Premier Li Fuchun of the State Council gave a report in Beijing on the 13th on "Practicing Strict Economy and Striving to Complete Socialist Construction." Responsible staff members from central agencies, democratic parties, people's organizations, National People's Congress deputies in Beijing, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, heads of Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, and representatives from various professional conferences held in Beijing attended the report meeting.

In his report, Li Fuchun first explained the policy of practicing strict economy put forward by the Chinese Communist Party in the past. He said that diligence, bravery, hard struggle, overcoming difficulties, and perseverance are the fine traditions of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese working people. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao put forward the firm and unwavering policy of increasing production, practicing strict economy, and gradually improving the people's living standards on the basis of developing production during the period of economic recovery and the first year of the Five-Year Plan. In the first year of the Five-Year Plan, the Central Committee also put forward the basic construction policy of "suitable, economical, and beautiful under possible conditions." These policies of the Central Committee are based on China's economic characteristics, the principles of Lenin and Stalin on the socialist economic system of economy, and drawing on the practical experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism.

After elaborating on the principles of Lenin and Stalin on the socialist economic system of economy and the practical experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism, Li Fuchun went on to say that we are a country with a large population and a backward economy, and we are in a transitional period of building socialism. To establish a socialist society in our country, it will take three five-year plans, that is, about fifteen years; and to catch up with advanced industrial countries, it will take decades of hard work, about fifty years, that is, the entire second half of this century. Such construction requires a lot of capital, which must be accumulated by ourselves. However, due to our weak industrial base, the speed of capital accumulation cannot be very fast. Therefore, it is of particular importance to carry forward the Party's fine tradition of hard struggle, oppose waste, practice strict economy, oppose the decentralized use of funds, and resolutely implement the policy of focusing on key construction.

He said that under the current conditions, the living standards of farmers are low, and the living standards of workers are also low. If we have excessively high standards for certain non-productive construction and living facilities in industrial and other construction, it will hinder the unity of the people and hinder the completion of the historical task of socialist industrialization. Only by adapting non-productive construction and living facilities to our current level of productivity, economic level, and people's living standards, and resolutely implementing the economy policy instructed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, can we build a heavy industry equipped with modern technology and establish a socialist material foundation. In this way, we will have the material conditions to further improve the people's living standards. So today's hard work is for a better future.

He said that increasing production and practicing strict economy is not a movement that can be solved by one department or one period of time. It is a universal, long-term, and regular political task for our people across the country.

After explaining the great achievements made in economic recovery and economic construction in the past five years, Li Fuchun focused on criticizing the widespread phenomenon of waste in capital construction, production management, and the lives of staff members in the past two years.

Li Fuchun said that the most prominent of these wasteful phenomena is that non-productive constructions, such as large auditoriums, office buildings, dormitories, clubs, etc., have been built too much, too well, and too early. In order to rapidly develop productive forces and realize the country's socialist industrialization, all the latest achievements of the Soviet Union in production technology must be "caught up with head-on" as much as possible. However, for the latest level of a happy life that the Soviet Union has obtained after decades of socialist construction, we cannot break away from our country's current economic level and the people's living standards to "catch up with head-on." Many comrades do not have enough understanding of this point. According to materials from the State Statistics Bureau: In the past two years, the non-productive investment of the six central industrial ministries accounted for 23.2% of the total investment, but in the Soviet Union's first five-year plan, the non-productive investment of the industrial sector only accounted for 14.5% of the total investment. This shows that we should have caught up with what we did not catch up with, but we caught up with what we should not have caught up with.

Li Fuchun said: In non-productive civil buildings, the waste caused by blindly pursuing so-called "national forms" and paying attention to beautiful decoration due to ignoring the principle of "suitable, economical, and beautiful under possible conditions" is very serious. In Beijing alone, the "big roofs" of 39 projects wasted 5.4 million yuan. For example, the construction of the office building jointly built by the State Planning Commission and four industrial ministries wasted 880,000 yuan on the big roof alone. The trend of this kind of "big roof" has developed rapidly in the past two or three years. According to Beijing statistics: the area of "big roof" buildings in 1952 was 51,000 square meters, which increased to 169,000 square meters in 1953, and further increased to 220,000 square meters in 1954. The facades and interior decorations of some buildings also used a large number of expensive or special materials. The Northeast Geological College school building, known as the "Geological Palace," was built on the foundation of the unfinished imperial palace of the puppet Manchukuo. The cost per square meter was 220 yuan, plus the original foundation, reaching 300 yuan, exceeding the national stipulated cost by 140%. In addition to the glazed tile roof, immortals, immortal beasts, coiled dragon Huabiao, lion rolling hydrangea, carved beams and painted buildings, and the large use of granite paving and marble pillars on the outside of this school building, various paintings were also painted inside the hall and on the ceiling, and many "candle-style", "crown-style", "oil lamp-style" lamps and various antique decorations were added. But the lights are very weak at night, and some people say it looks like a Buddhist hall or an ancient temple.

Li Fuchun said that the result of excessively increasing decoration will inevitably greatly increase the cost of the building, while the usable area will be greatly reduced. For example, the cost of the Angang Black Metallurgical Design Company building is 240 yuan per square meter, but the usable area is less than 50%. All these "luxurious" buildings that pursue form also invariably ignore the needs and interests of users. The "map library" in the Angang Black Metallurgical Design Company building is the treasure house of the design agency. It must be moisture-proof, fire-proof, and isolated from everything that may cause danger. However, when designing this "map library," the designers used a lot of effort to design a "continuous arch" style gate, but allowed many water pipes, heating pipes, and gas pipes to pass through the "map library," and they were all exposed on the outside. After building "beautiful" houses, it is necessary to purchase "luxurious" interior equipment accordingly, so the trend of purchasing high-end consumer goods such as carpets, sofas, radios, and phonographs has also followed. The staff dormitory of the Institute of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health is very particular. A section-level cadre lives in five rooms, and there are 77 sets of sofas in the entire institute with 240 employees. When the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant was being prepared for construction, it bought 28 sets of sofas, 33 carpets, and also cars and radios. In this way, it cost more than 400,000 yuan just to buy furniture.

Li Fuchun pointed out that the construction of welfare facilities in factories, railways, and farms should distinguish between priorities and urgencies. He said: Generally, new enterprises should first build necessary dormitories, health clinics, canteens, and schools. Other welfare facilities such as clubs, sanatoriums, sports fields, and green areas can only be reported to the higher authorities for construction year by year after the construction unit is completed and put into production, according to the increase in labor productivity, the reduction in costs, and the increase in profits. This is in line with the principle of gradually improving the people's living standards on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity; only in this way can the enthusiasm of the people across the country for building socialism be encouraged. At present, the urgently needed housing, labor protection, and welfare facilities of some existing enterprises have not been properly resolved, but in many new enterprises, these facilities are done too well, too much, and too early. This phenomenon is very unreasonable. For example, in the capital construction investment of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, all welfare facilities are very complete, and the "greening environment fee" alone cost 60,000 yuan. As of this spring, 41,000 yuan has been spent, including two unplanned fountains costing 11,000 yuan; buying more than 60 kinds of flowers and trees, some of which cost as much as 50 yuan per plant; and even 17.5 kilograms of goldfish were included in the capital construction investment. Some enterprises have not solved the most urgent problems of their employees, but have spent a lot of money to do some unnecessary things, or nominally solve problems for employees, but have not done things according to the actual situation of the employees. For example, in the new dormitory of Qiqihar Railway Vehicle Factory, the highest rent is 41 yuan per month, and the lowest is 18 yuan, which employees cannot afford, but it is only 6 yuan a month to live in the original dormitory.

Li Fuchun said that there is also waste in productive construction. In industrial construction, because of the eagerness for quick success, the construction procedures are not followed, the situation is not clarified, systematic preparatory work is not carried out, and even materials are blindly prepared and construction is rushed before the construction plan is determined, resulting in wasted funds and stockpiled materials. For example, the First Automobile Manufacturing Factory had stockpiled materials worth 10.57 million yuan by the end of November 1954. According to a recent inspection and research by the working group of the State Planning Commission, if these errors could have been avoided from the beginning and careful calculations were made, 100 million yuan could have been saved. Waste in construction is also manifested in poor labor organization, low construction quality, low labor productivity, low utilization rate of machinery and equipment, and high construction costs.

Li Fuchun then criticized the waste in production enterprises. First of all, there are too many management personnel and bloated organizations in production enterprises. According to a survey by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the Qinghe Woolen Mill can reduce more than 3,600 people. Secondly, the product quality is poor, and the trial production of new products is not good. The scrap rate of castings in the factories of the First Ministry of Machine Industry last year was 12.5%. The ministry planned to produce 187 new products in the first quarter, but only completed 88. Third, the management is poor. In the past year, the Harbin Food Company had more than 50 waste incidents, and the waste figures that can be verified in the accounts amounted to 570,000 yuan.

Li Fuchun said that in the current industrial production management, we must, without exception, pay special attention to strengthening technical management, improving technical level, and strengthening the management of labor costs and finance. These are the two key issues at present. Only in this way can we guarantee the improvement of labor productivity, the reduction of costs, the increase of products, and the improvement of product quality.

Li Fuchun pointed out that the reasons for the above-mentioned wasteful errors are:

(1) Politically, there is no real understanding of the necessity of hard work in the period of socialist construction. Many comrades have ignored the instructions of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to oppose arrogance and complacency and to require hard work. They have been overwhelmed by the victory of the country and misled by the victories in economic recovery and economic construction, so that they cannot see or do not understand the arduousness of socialist construction. They have not clearly distinguished that we should learn the latest technological achievements of the Soviet Union in productive construction, and we should learn the spirit of hard work in the early days of socialist construction in the Soviet Union in non-productive construction and living facilities.

(2) In economic management, there is a lack of economic perspective, no attention to economic accounting, and no research on economic effects. Therefore, the plans and designs for capital construction do not distinguish between priorities and urgencies, everything is a "century-old plan", only construction is considered, not funds; the quotas in capital construction and production are not advanced, and the standards are not strict; the budget is "wide-ranging and narrow-using", but in reality, it is wide-ranging and wide-using. Some factory directors and deputy factory directors regard managing financial costs as a "small matter", and pay attention to ostentation, extravagance, and splendor in non-productive expenditures, using this to express "modernization" and "great power style", without understanding that diligence and thrift are our virtues, and hard work and simplicity are our style.

(3) Organizationally, the centralized and unified leadership is insufficient, and there is a lack of unified and strict systems; financial supervision is not strict; especially, there is a lack of serious and in-depth inspection work. There is a large amount of decentralism and laissez-faire in economic work, so that everyone is doing their own thing in non-productive construction, and they influence and imitate each other, resulting in serious waste.

In the final analysis, these are all manifestations of subjectivism, formalism, and liberalism. Some comrades have ignored our country's economic level, the people's living standards, the possibility of capital accumulation, and the requirements of socialist industrialization, and their blind "enthusiasm" is very great. Some comrades have not only not been angered by the phenomenon of waste, but believe that "construction has no experience, waste is inevitable", "construction success is a big deal, waste is a small matter", using this to forgive themselves and forgive others; replacing mutual supervision and inspection with mutual forgiveness.

Li Fuchun said that the State Planning Commission should also bear great responsibility for these wasteful errors. We have paid a considerable price for these lessons we have learned today.

Li Fuchun called for efforts to increase production and practice economy in all aspects and links. First of all, we must vigorously revise the designs of various construction projects to reduce their costs. He said that the main production parts (main workshops, main equipment) in industrial construction should be advanced, but excessively high factory building standards should also be reduced. Auxiliary workshops must be reduced as much as possible based on the principles of enterprise specialization and enterprise mutual cooperation and mutual combination. The design standards and costs of railways and highways should also be reduced as much as possible according to different situations. All other non-productive and consumer buildings (including schools, office buildings, dormitories, warehouses, stations, etc.) must strive to reduce construction standards and construction costs based on the current economic level and people's living standards.

Li Fuchun also pointed out various measures for economy. He said that the production part of factory buildings designed by the Soviet Union will not be changed; but the non-productive part of the Soviet design should be reduced according to the new cost. Domestically designed buildings should be reviewed again, and designs that do not meet economic requirements should be modified as much as possible without delaying the construction progress. The cost of civil buildings must be reduced. The preliminary indicators are: offices and classrooms in universities, 45 yuan to 70 yuan per square meter. The standards for primary and secondary schools are stipulated by the Ministry of Education and reported to the State Council for approval. Residences range from adobe bungalows to three-story buildings, 20 to 60 yuan per square meter, depending on different regions, different climatic conditions, and other conditions. General warehouses, 40 yuan to 50 yuan per square meter. Railway stations are divided into large, medium, and small stations, 30 yuan to 70 yuan per square meter. High-end civil buildings exceeding the above regulations must be approved by the State Council. Special laboratories, research institutes, and special warehouses can be specified by various ministries according to the principles of suitability and economy, and special standards are reported to the State Council for approval. According to the indicators proposed above, general civil buildings are designed to standard design by the Ministry of Construction Engineering, and the budget quota is modified accordingly. In areas and mining areas with only one or two factories and mines, bungalows should be built as much as possible. If bungalows occupy too much arable land and are not economically reasonable, two-story residences and three-story offices can be built, but the above cost standards cannot be exceeded. Near large cities, in suburbs far from the city, bungalows and buildings can be built in a mixed way according to local conditions; in suburbs close to the city, considering the rational requirements of urban planning, more semi-permanent buildings can be built. In some areas, due to limited terrain and too little land available for construction, buildings can be built without exceeding the above-mentioned highest cost standard.

Li Fuchun pointed out that the planning and design of existing cities should be reviewed again, and put forward the following principles: The new industrial cities that have been planned should be reviewed city by city according to the current actual situation, and high-rise buildings should generally not be built; cities that are not industrial centers only need to carry out the planning of industrial areas and factories, and do not need to rebuild old cities, and try to use the original buildings in the city; the main roads can be wider, and more open space can be left between residential groups. The welfare and health facilities in the city should be built in stages; various public utilities in the city must be held step by step, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies.

Li Fuchun pointed out that every link in the construction, from the preparation to the completion and putting into production, should be strictly economical. In terms of geological exploration, the appropriation should be reduced by 10% for exploration projects that do not require an increase in the amount of exploration work; for exploration projects that must increase the amount of exploration work within the first five-year plan, the amount of work should be increased by 10% on the basis of the original appropriation. It is forbidden to establish preparatory institutions too early. Large factories can be established one and a half years before construction, and medium and small factories can be established half a year to one year before construction. In the future, without the approval of the State Council, various projects shall not arbitrarily hold large-scale groundbreaking ceremonies, ribbon-cutting and other ceremonies.

Li Fuchun said that the principle of economy should be implemented in every link of production. All state-owned enterprises and joint state-private enterprises should further reduce costs. The 1955 plan stipulates that industrial costs should be reduced by 6%, and now it should be proposed to strive to reduce by 7.5% in the second half of the year; the original regulation to reduce transportation costs by 2.7%, and should strive to reduce by 3.7% in the second half of the year; the original regulation to reduce commercial circulation costs by 12.9%, and should strive to reduce by 14% in the second half of the year. All industrial enterprises must strive to save raw materials. In the textile industry, the amount of cotton used per yarn should be reduced from 393 catties to at least 390 catties. The average amount of cotton used per yarn in various economic types of textile factories in Shanghai has been reduced to 386 catties, and textile enterprises across the country should strive to reach this standard. There is also great potential for saving steel, electricity, non-ferrous metals, and gasoline, which should be strived to be tapped in order to create more wealth for the country.

Li Fuchun said that the standards for office equipment and expenses should also be reduced. He said that the country should start from Beijing first and gradually unify the management of organ housing. All organs across the country should stop buying sofas and carpets. The existing sofas and carpets in various places and departments can be unified and adjusted by the local government management agency. The conference room should be uniformly equipped with conference tables, without sofas or carpets, and the standards for all other indoor equipment should be reduced. Neatness, cleanliness, and simplicity are our aesthetic standards. No fruits, cigarettes, or refreshments should be served at meetings. Except for entertaining foreign guests, there should be no banquets or meals. All staff members of the agency must buy tickets to participate in all evening parties, except for entertaining foreign guests and foreign troupes performing. The use of cars should be reduced. After the implementation of the wage system, dormitory furniture should be gradually converted to self-provided or rented.

He said that in the construction of culture, education, and health, matters that the masses have the strength to handle should be encouraged as much as possible.

Regarding how to implement the new policy of economy in the second half of this year, Li Fuchun also gave specific instructions in the report. For productive buildings (such as factory buildings), designs that can be changed should be changed without hindering the completion of the construction progress and investment plan and without reducing the construction projects, and those that cannot be changed can continue to be constructed. For non-productive buildings, before the Ministry of Construction Engineering stipulates a unified standard, various departments will temporarily stipulate reduced standards. Designs that can be changed should be changed, and those that cannot be changed can be changed or not, but they must consult with the design department to reduce the construction decoration and housing equipment as much as possible, and must ensure that the cost is reduced by 10% to 15%. For projects that have been prepared for construction in June, the existing design can be slightly modified on the condition that the cost is reduced by 10% before construction can begin. For projects that will only start construction after July, the design should be appropriately modified on the condition that the cost is reduced by 15%.

Li Fuchun emphasized that if the entire party and the entire country are mobilized to resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and implement the above measures, a huge amount of funds will be saved for the country. No matter which aspect this fund is invested in, it will play a huge role in the socialist construction of our country. Therefore, practicing strict economy is by no means a passive measure, but an active method to accelerate the realization of the country's socialist industrialization. All departments and all regions should strive to increase production, add new products, and open up new sales channels while practicing strict economy to ensure the completion of the task of capital accumulation.

    厉行节约，为完成社会主义建设而奋斗
    ——李富春副总理在中央各机关、党派、团体负责工作人员等参加的报告会上所作的报告摘要
    新华社二十日讯国务院副总理李富春十三日在北京作了关于“厉行节约，为完成社会主义建设而奋斗”的报告。中央各机关、各民主党派、各人民团体的负责工作人员，在京全国人民代表大会代表，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在京委员，北京、天津两市负责人以及各地来京出席各种专业会议的代表等参加了报告会。
    李富春在报告中首先说明中国共产党历次提出的厉行节约的方针。他说，勤劳勇敢、艰苦奋斗、克服困难、坚韧不拔是中国共产党和中国劳动人民的优良传统。中国共产党中央和毛主席在经济恢复时期和五年计划实行的第一年，就提出增加生产、厉行节约和在发展生产的基础上逐步改善人民生活的这一坚定不移的方针。在五年计划开始的第一年，中央还提出了“适用、经济、可能条件下的美观”的基本建设方针。中央的这些方针，是根据中国的经济特点、根据列宁、斯大林关于社会主义经济的节约制度的原理并吸取苏联建设社会主义的实际经验提出的。
    李富春在阐述列宁斯大林关于社会主义经济的节约原理和苏联建设社会主义的实际经验后接着说，我们是一个人口众多经济落后的国家，我们正处在建设社会主义的过渡时期，要在我国建立社会主义社会，需要经过三个五年计划，即大约十五年左右时间；而要赶上先进的工业国，还需要几十年的艰苦努力，大约需要五十年的时间，即本世纪的整个下半世纪。要进行这样的建设就需要大量资金，这些资金要靠自己积累。但由于我国的工业基础薄弱，资金积累的速度不可能很快。因此，发扬党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统，反对浪费，厉行节约，反对分散使用资金，坚决贯彻重点建设的方针，就有特别重要的意义。
    他说，在目前条件下，农民生活水平低，工人生活水平也还低，如果我们在工业和其他方面的建设中，某些非生产性的建设和生活设施标准过高，就会妨害人民的团结，就会妨害社会主义工业化的历史任务的完成。只有在非生产性的建设和生活设施上适应我国目前的生产力水平、经济水平和人民生活水平，坚决贯彻党中央和毛主席指示的节约方针，我们才有可能建设起现代技术装备的重工业，建立起社会主义的物质基础，这样，我们才有进一步改善人民生活的物质条件。所以今天的刻苦，正是为了美好的未来。
    他说，增加生产，厉行节约，不是一个部门、一个时期的运动可以解决问题的，这是我们全国人民普遍的长期的经常的政治任务。
    李富春在说明五年来经济恢复和经济建设工作中获得巨大成绩后，着重批评了近两年来在基本建设、生产管理和工作人员生活方面存在着的普遍浪费现象。
    李富春说，这些浪费现象最突出的是非生产性的建设如大礼堂、办公楼、宿舍、俱乐部等等修建得过多、过好、过早。为了迅速发展生产力，实现国家的社会主义工业化，苏联在生产技术上的一切最新成果是要尽可能“迎头赶上”的。但是对于苏联经过几十年社会主义建设而获得的幸福生活的最新水平，我们却不能脱离我国当前的经济水平和人民的生活水平也来“迎头赶上”。很多同志对这点认识不够。据国家统计局材料：中央六个工业部过去两年的非生产性的投资占全部投资的百分之二十三点二，但苏联在第一个五年计划中，工业部门的非生产性投资只占全部投资的百分之十四点五。这说明，我们应该迎头赶上的没有赶上，而不应迎头赶上的却赶上了。
    李富春说：在非生产性的民用建筑中，由于忽视“适用、经济、可能条件下的美观”的原则，盲目追求所谓“民族形式”，讲究漂亮装饰而造成的浪费是十分严重的。北京市仅三十九项工程的“大屋顶”就浪费了五百四十万元。如国家计划委员会和四个工业部合建的办公楼的建筑，单用大屋顶就浪费了八十八万元。这种“大屋顶”的风气两三年来发展得很快。据北京市统计：一九五二年“大屋顶”建筑的面积为五万一千平方公尺，一九五三年增为十六万九千平方公尺，一九五四年更增为二十二万平方公尺。有些建筑物的立面和室内装饰，还大量采用了贵重的或特殊的材料。被称为“地质宫”的东北地质学院校舍，是利用伪满未建成的皇宫基础建设的，每平方公尺造价为二百二十元，加上原有基础达三百元，超过国家规定造价百分之一百四十。这座校舍除了外表上的琉璃瓦顶、仙人仙兽、盘龙华表、狮子滚绣球、雕梁画栋和大量采用花岗石铺地、大理石作柱外，大厅内部和天花板上还画了各种图画，又加上了许多“蜡烛式”、“皇冠式”、
  “油灯式”的灯和各种古色古香的装饰。但晚间灯光很弱，有人说像是佛堂、古庙。
    李富春说，过分地增加装饰的结果，必然会使建筑物的造价大大增加，而利用面积却大大减少。如鞍钢黑色冶金设计公司大楼每平方公尺造价二百四十元，但使用面积还不到百分之五十。所有这些追求形式的“豪华”的建筑，同时也无例外地都忽视了使用者的需要和利益。鞍钢黑色冶金设计公司大楼中的“图库”，是设计机关的宝库，要防潮、防火，要和一切可能招致危险的东西隔绝。但设计人员在设计这个“图库”时用很大力量设计了一个
  “连拱”式的大门，却让许多水管、暖气管、瓦斯管通过“图库”，而且都露在外面。建筑了“漂亮”的房子，就还要相应地购置“豪华”的室内设备，因之购买地毯、沙发、收音机、电唱机等高级消费品的风气也随着而来。卫生部的流行病学研究所职工宿舍很讲究，一个科级干部住五间房子，全所编制二百四十人，就有沙发七十七套。太原热电厂在筹建时就买了沙发二十八套，地毯三十三条，另外还有汽车、收音机等，这样仅仅买家具就花了四十多万元。
    李富春指出：工厂、铁道、农场的福利设施的修建应该分别轻重缓急。他说：各新建企业一般地应该先盖必要的宿舍、卫生所、食堂和学校。其他福利设施如俱乐部、休养所、运动场、绿化地区等，只能在建设单位完工投入生产后，再根据劳动生产率的提高、成本的降低和利润的增长情况分别地报请上级逐年建设。这样才符合在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步提高人民生活的原则；也只有这样，才能鼓励全国人民建设社会主义的热情。目前有些原有企业急需的住宅、劳动保护和福利设施还没有得到妥善的解决，而在许多新建企业中，这类设施却办得过好、过多、过早，这种现象是很不合理的。例如国营北京第一棉纺织厂的基本建设投资中，各项福利设施都很完备，单是“绿化环境费”就花了六万元。截至今春止，已支出四万
  一千元；其中包括无计划修建的两座喷水池，造价
  一万一千元；购买花树六十多种，有的每株贵达五十元；甚至把十七斤五两金鱼也都打入基本建设投资中。国营北京第二棉纺织厂用二十个理发员，却买了一百零四把理发推子和发剪、一百二十八把剃刀，可以用三四十年。有些企业没有解决职工的最迫切问题，却花了很多钱去办一些不急需的事，或者形式上也是为职工解决问题，却并没有按照职工的实际情况办事。例如齐齐哈尔机车车辆厂新盖的宿舍，房租最高的一个月要四十一元，最低的也要十八元，职工都住不起，但住原来的宿舍一个月六元就够了。
    李富春说，在生产性建设中同样存在着浪费现象。在工业建设中，因急于求成，就不按建设程序办事，不弄清情况，不进行有系统的准备工作，甚至建设方案尚未确定就盲目备料，仓促施工，因而浪费资金，积压器材。如第一汽车制造厂，到一九五四年十一月底为止，共积压器材一千零五十七万元。据最近国家计划委员会工作组检查研究，如一开始即能避免这些错误，而认真精打细算，可以节约投资一亿元。施工中的浪费，还表现在劳动组织不好、建筑质量低、劳动生产率低、机械设备的利用率低、建筑成本高等方面。
    李富春接着批判了在生产企业中的浪费现象。首先是生产企业中的管理人员过多，机构拥肿。据中共北京市委调查：石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂和清河制呢厂三个单位可以减少三千六百多人。其次是产品质量低劣，新产品试制成绩不好。第一机械工业部各厂去年全年的铸件废品率为百分之十二点五。该部第一季度计划生产新产品一百八十七种，只完成了八十八种。第三是管理不善。哈尔滨食品公司去年一年中发生的浪费事件就有五十多次，有账可查的浪费数字就有五十七万元。
    李富春说，在目前工业生产管理上，我们必须无例外地特别注意加强技术管理，提高技术水平和加强劳动成本财务的管理，这是当前两个关键问题。只有这样才能保证劳动生产率的提高、成本的降低、产品的增加和产品质量的提高。
    李富春指出产生上述浪费错误的原因是：
      （一）在政治上没有真正认识社会主义建设时期艰苦奋斗的必要。许多同志忽略了中共七届二中全会决议反对骄傲自满、要求艰苦奋斗的指示，被全国胜利冲昏了头脑，被经济恢复和经济建设中的胜利所迷惑，以致看不到或不理解社会主义建设的艰苦性。他们没有明确分清在生产性建设上应当学习苏联的最新技术成就，在非生产性建设和生活设施上应当学习苏联社会主义建设初期的艰苦奋斗的精神。
      （二）在经济管理上缺乏经济观点，不注意经济核算，不研究经济效果。因此，在基本建设的计划和设计上不分轻重缓急，样样“百年大计”，只管建设，不顾资金；在基本建设和生产上的定额不先进，标准不严格；在预算上“宽打窄用”，实际是宽打宽用。有些厂长、副厂长把管财务成本看成是“小事情”，在非生产性的支出上讲排场、讲阔气、讲华丽，以此来表示“现代化”和“大国风度”，而不了解克勤克俭，正是我们的美德，艰苦朴素正是我们的风度。
      （三）组织上集中统一领导不够，缺乏统一的严格的制度；财政监督不严；特别是缺乏认真深入的检查工作。经济工作中存在着大量的分散主义和放任自流现象，以致在非生产建设上各搞各的，而又相互影响，相互模仿，结果造成了严重的浪费。
    归根结底，这些都是主观主义、形式主义和自由主义的表现。有些同志忽视了我国的经济水平、人民生活水平，忽视了资金积累的可能和社会主义工业化的要求，盲目的“积极性”很大。有些同志对浪费现象不但没有引起痛恨，反而认为“建设无经验，浪费难免”、“建设成功是大事，浪费是小事”，以此来原谅自己，也原谅旁人；以彼此原谅，代替了彼此间的监督和检查。
    李富春说，产生上述这些浪费错误，国家计划委员会也应负很大的责任。我们今天取得这些教训是付出了相当的代价的。
    李富春号召从各个方面、各个环节上努力增加生产、厉行节约，首先必须大力修改各类建筑工程的设计，降低它们的造价。他说，工业建设中的主要生产部分（主要车间、主要设备）应该先进，但过高的厂房标准也要削减。附属车间必须从企业的专业化和企业的相互协作、相互结合的原则出发，可减的就减。铁路，公路的设计标准和造价也应根据不同情况尽可能降低。其他一切非生产性、消费性的建筑（包括学校、办公楼、宿舍、仓库、车站等），要根据现在经济水平和人民生活水平努力降低建筑标准和建筑造价。
      李富春还指出了关于节约的各项措施。他说，工厂建筑的生产部分，凡苏联设计的一律不改；但苏联设计的非生产部分应照新造价减低。国内设计的，要重新审查，对不合经济要求的设计应在不推迟建设进度的条件下，尽可能地加以修改。民用建筑的造价一律要降低，初步指标是：办公室和高等学校的教室，每平方公尺四十五元到七十元。中、小学校的标准由教育部规定，报国务院批准。住宅根据不同的地区、不同气候条件及其他情况，由土坯平房到三层楼，每平方公尺二十到六十元。通用仓库，每平方公尺四十元到五十元。铁路车站分大中小车站，每平方公尺三十元到七十元。超过上述规定的高级民用建筑，要经国务院批准。特殊的试验室、研究所、特种仓库，可由各部按照适用、节约的原则，规定特殊的标准，报国务院批准。根据上面提出的指标，一般民用建筑由建筑工程部制定标准设计，并相应地修改预算定额。只有一两个工厂和矿山的地区和矿区，应尽量建筑平房，如因平房占用耕地太多，经济上不合理时，可以建筑二层的住宅和三层的办公室，但不能超过上述造价标准。大城市附近，在离城较远的郊区，平房和楼房可以按照当地情况混合建筑；在靠近城市的郊区，考虑到城市规划的合理要求，可以多建筑些半永久性的楼房。有些地区因限于地形，可供建筑用地太少，在不超过上述最高造价的标准下可以建筑楼房。
    李富春在报告中指出现有城市的规划、设计要重新进行审查，并提出以下几条原则：已经规划的新工业城市，应根据现在的实际情况逐市加以审查，
  一般不得盖高层建筑；不是工业集中的城市，只需进行工业区和工厂的规划，不要进行旧城市的改建，尽量利用原有城市的建筑物；干路可以宽些，住宅群之间可多留空地。城市中的福利卫生设施应分期建设；城市中的各种公用事业，必须分别轻重缓急，逐步举办。
    李富春指出建设中的每个环节，从筹建起到完工投入生产止，都要严格节约。在地质勘探方面，凡勘探工作量不需要增加的勘探项目，应削减拨款百分之十；凡在第一个五年计划内必须增加勘探工作量的勘探项目，应在原定拨款的基础上增加工作量百分之十。要禁止过早地建立筹建机构，大厂可在施工前一年半成立，中小厂可在施工前半年到一年成立。今后凡不经过国务院批准，各种工程不得随意举行大规模的开工典礼和剪彩等仪式。
    李富春说在生产中的每个环节都要贯彻节约的原则。所有国营企业和公私合营企业都应当进一步降低成本。一九五五年计划规定工业成本降低百分之六，现在应提出下半年争取降低百分之七点五；交通运输成本原规定降低百分之二点七，下半年应争取降低百分之三点七；商业流转费原规定降低百分之十二点九，下半年应争取降低百分之十四。各个工业企业都要努力节约原材料。在纺织工业中，每件纱的用棉量应由三百九十三斤至少降为三百九十斤。上海各种经济类型的纺织厂每件纱平均用棉量已降低到三百八十六斤，全国各纺织企业都应当争取达到这个标准。在钢铁、电力、有色金属、汽油的节约方面也存在着很大的潜力，应当努力挖掘，以便为国家创造更多的财富。
      李富春说，办公室的设备和开支的标准也应当降低。他说，全国首先从北京开始，逐步统一管理机关房屋。全国各机关一律停止购买沙发、地毯，各地各部门现有沙发、地毯，可由当地政府管理机构统一调整。会议室一律用会议桌，不摆沙发、地毯，其他一切室内用具标准都应降低。整齐、清洁、朴素是我们的美的标准。开会时一律不招待水果、纸烟、点心。除招待外宾外，一律不宴会，不会餐。机关工作人员参加一切晚会，除招待外宾和外国剧团献演外，都须买票。汽车的使用应当减少。宿舍家具在实行工资制后，应当逐步转为自备或租用。
    他说，在文教卫生的建设中，凡群众有力举办的事，应尽量鼓励群众举办。
    关于今年下半年如何执行节约的新方针问题，李富春在报告中也作了具体的指示。生产性的建筑（如厂房）在不妨碍建设进度和投资计划的完成以及不削减建设项目的条件下，设计能改的就改，不能改的仍可继续施工。非生产性的建筑在建筑工程部没有规定统一的标准以前，由各部暂行规定降低的标准，设计能改的就改，不能改的可不改，但必须同设计部门商洽尽量减少建筑装饰和房屋设备，必须保证降低造价百分之十到十五。在六月份已作好施工准备的工程，在保证降低造价百分之十的条件下，对现有的设计稍加修改后就可动工。七月份以后才开始施工的工程，应该在保证降低造价百分之十五的条件下，对设计加以适当的修改。
    李富春着重指出：全党和全国如果都动员起来，坚决贯彻中央和毛主席的指示，贯彻以上的措施，将为国家节约巨量资金，这一笔资金不论投之于那方面，对我国的社会主义建设事业都将起巨大的作用。因此，厉行节约决不是消极的措施，而是积极的、加速实现国家的社会主义工业化的方法。各个部门、各个地区都应该在厉行节约的同时，努力增加生产，增加新的产品，开辟新的销路来保障资金积累任务的完成。
