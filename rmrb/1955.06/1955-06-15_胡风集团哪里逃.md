After the third batch of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was revealed, we finally understood where the Hu Feng and his ilk's backers were—it turns out they were running dogs of the Kuomintang bandit gang with double "C" affiliations ("Central Statistics Bureau" and "Sino-American Cooperative Organization"). The number of Chinese people killed by these two "C" organizations is more than the number of people eaten by wolves throughout history. And Hu Feng and his small gang of running dogs are precisely this kind of wolf spawn. They are not only wolf spawn, but also seem to have been apprentices of foxes. They not only know how to strike with a club, crack a whip, throw cluster grenades, and grab loopholes, but also know how to pretend to bury their heads, give empty self-criticisms, feign honesty, sell themselves as proactive, act perfunctorily, play dead, create smoke screens, and drag out time. Even good deeds like publishing periodicals, opening bookstores, learning technology, teaching students, writing poems, writing plays, visiting Korea to express sympathy, writing about heroic figures, and studying Marxism-Leninism, all become means of sabotaging the revolution in their hands. Truly, all evils are embodied in them.

For Hu Feng and a few of his dehumanized, direct-line wolf spawn running dogs, the people can only never forgive them. As for the rest who have been tainted by dog behavior but are not fully dog-like, as long as they are not willing to be isolated and traitorous lackeys who are willing to thoroughly confess their rebellious traces and wash away their dog nature, we should allow them to become human again. However, if they dare to use fox-like tricks again, such as pretending to bury their heads, giving empty self-criticisms, feigning honesty, or playing dead, that will not work either. If counter-revolutionaries who refuse to repent want to die, then their death cannot just be a "pretend" death.

We will naturally deal with the running dogs who have already revealed their true forms. Where are the running dogs who have not yet shown their faces hiding? From their plans and actual actions, it can be seen that they are constantly looking for opportunities to infiltrate our hearts. May all sectors of our society conduct a thorough examination of the heart and completely eliminate this batch of dog spawn!

    胡风集团哪里逃
    赵树理
    关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料揭露出来之后，我们才了解到胡风等人的娘家在什么地方——原来他们是国民党匪帮双料“中”字号（“中统”和“中美合作所”）的走狗。被这两个“中”字号杀害的中国人，要比有史以来的豺狼吃的人还多，而胡风等人这一小帮子走狗，正是这样的狼种。他们不仅是狼种，而且似乎又当过狐狸的徒弟。他们不但会打闷棍、甩鞭子、投掷集束手榴弹、抓缺口，而且会假埋头、空检讨、装老实、卖积极、敷衍、装死、布疑阵、拖时间；甚至像出刊物、开书店、学技术、教学生、作诗、编剧、赴朝慰问、写英雄人物、读马克思列宁主义等等好事，一到他们手里就都变成破坏革命的手段，真是万恶皆备于他们矣。
    像胡风和几只丧尽人性的嫡亲狼种走狗，人民对他们除了决不能饶恕；其余已染狗风但狗性未全的人，只要不是甘愿做狼狗的孤臣孽子、而愿意彻底交代逆迹，一洗狗风，我们当允其重新做人。不过他们如敢再用假埋头、空检讨、装老实、装死等狐狸伎俩，也是不行的。死不悔改的反革命分子如果要死，那末这死就不能让他们仅仅是“装”一“装”了。
    已经露了原形的走狗们我们自然要处理；尚未露头脚的走狗们还都藏在什么地方呢？从他们的计划和实际行动中都可以看出他们时时在找机会钻入我们的心脏。愿我们各界都做一下透视心脏的工作，彻底消灭这批狗种！
