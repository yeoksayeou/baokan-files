Shaanxi and Other Places Cultivate "Biennial Walnuts"

　　In 1953, the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute discovered a type of walnut in Futuo Township, Fufeng County, Shaanxi Province, which blooms and bears fruit in the second year after sowing. Local people call it "biennial walnut." After the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute discovered it, they immediately conducted experiments. By 1954, two of the walnut trees they had sown had bloomed and produced walnuts. This year, the Ministry of Agriculture requested the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute and the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture to cultivate and promote this excellent variety in a planned manner, and also requested agricultural science institutions in Shandong, Shanxi, and other provinces to conduct trial planting, so as to promote planting throughout the country in the future.
　　This type of walnut tree generally has a very high trunk, vigorous growth, and grows relatively quickly. A thirty-year-old tree is as tall as thirty-six feet, and each tree produces about two thousand walnuts per year, and bears fruit every year. The walnuts produced have thin skin, full kernels, and an oil content generally around 70 percent. (Tao Rongzong)

    陕西等地培植“隔年核桃”
    西北农业科学研究所一九五三年在陕西省扶风县佛陀乡发现一种核桃，播种后第二年即陆续开花结果，当地群众叫做“隔年核桃”。西北农业科学研究所发现后当即进行实验，到一九五四年，他们所播种的核桃就有两株开花结桃。今年农业部要求西北农业科学研究所和陕西省农业厅有计划地培植和推广这种优良品种，同时也要求山东、山西等省农业科学机关进行试种，以便将来在全国各地推广种植。
    这种核桃树一般是主干很高，树势旺盛，生长比较迅速。三十年生大树高达三十六尺，每株年产核桃约两千多枚，而且年年结实。所产核桃皮薄，仁满，含油量一般在百分之七十左右。（陶荣宗）
