Counter-Revolutionary Elements Cannot Escape the Net of Justice
Ye Gongchuo

After the "People's Daily" published the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," many people had the same feeling: When we saw the first and second batches of materials, we didn't expect the Hu Feng clique to be a counter-revolutionary group.

This precisely reflects everyone's usual carelessness and poor vigilance and judgment. Just looking at the third batch of materials, we can clearly recognize that the backbone of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a mixed bunch of Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary military officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and turncoats who surrendered to the enemy—truly what Beijingers call "something to see."

In the third batch of materials, in a letter from Luyuan to Hu Feng dated May 13, 1944, it says, "As you said: Going into battle bare-chested is not our tactic. Later, I felt that I should learn a little 'dark cleverness' (?)" If not "bare-chested," what weapons do they use? It's "dark cleverness"! And what is "dark cleverness"? No need to ask, it's the secret agent tactics learned from the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization"!

This is not just Luyuan's personal matter. In fact, all the Hu Feng elements did as Luyuan did. They skillfully used this "cleverness" to attack the Party and the people. Look at the materials published by the "People's Daily": feigning progress, burrowing into the liver, establishing a liaison network, probing for intelligence, stealing documents... what is this if not secret agent behavior! The Hu Feng clique is more sinister than other secret agent organizations because they also wear a Marxist cloak and play two-faced tricks.

Before these materials were published, the vast majority of people thought they were dealing with "ideological problems"; but today, we already know that the Hu Feng elements are counter-revolutionary elements, and we must pursue them to the end and impose legal sanctions on them separately! Today is not the time to engage in "ideological problems." It is not difficult for us to imagine that the Hu Feng elements are hoping to "slip by" on "ideological problems"! In the complex and sharp class struggle of the transition period, if our cause achieves a bit of success, the enemy will add a bit of hatred and step up their sabotage. We must learn from the Hu Feng incident, heighten our vigilance, and expose the conspiracies of all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

Under the close surveillance of the people, counter-revolutionary elements cannot hide; in today's world where the people hold power, counter-revolutionary elements cannot escape the net of justice.

    反革命分子难逃法网
    叶恭绰
    “人民日报”发表了“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”以后，很多人都有同一的感想：当我们看见了第一、二两批材料的时候，还没想到胡风集团竟是一个反革命的集团。
    这正反映出大家平日的麻痹大意和警惕性判断力太差了。我们单看第三批材料，已经可以认识清楚胡风反革命集团的骨干，是蒋匪帮特务、反动军官、托洛茨基分子，革命叛徒、自首变节分子等形形色色的一个混成团，真是北京话所谓“够瞧的。”
    在第三批材料里，一九四四年五月十三日绿原给胡风的信上说，“正如您说的：赤膊上阵不是我们底战术。以后，我觉得应该学习一点‘阴暗的聪明’（？）”，不“赤膊上阵”拿什么武器？是“阴暗的聪明”！“阴暗的聪明”又是什么？不用问，是从“中美合作所”学来的特务手段！
    这不仅是绿原个人的事。事实上是所有胡风分子都按绿原那样做的，他们熟练地运用这种“聪明”向党、向人民进攻。看一看“人民日报”公布的材料：伪装进步，钻进肝脏，建立联络网，刺探情报，盗窃文件……，这不是特务行为是什么！胡风集团，比其他特务组织更阴险，因为他们还披着马克思主义外衣，还耍着两面派的手法。
    在这些材料公布以前，绝大多数人认为他们是“思想问题”；但是在今天，我们已经知道胡风分子是反革命分子，我们一定要追究到底，分别予以法律制裁！在今天，不是搞“思想问题”的时候，我们不难想像，胡风分子正希望从“思想问题”上“滑过去”！在过渡时期复杂的尖锐的阶级斗争里，我们的事业有一分成就，敌人也就添一分仇视，也就加紧一步破坏。我们要从胡风事件吸取教训，提高警惕，揭发一切暗藏反革命分子的阴谋。
    在人民的严密监视下，反革命分子是隐藏不住的；在人民掌握政权的今天，反革命分子是难逃法网的。
