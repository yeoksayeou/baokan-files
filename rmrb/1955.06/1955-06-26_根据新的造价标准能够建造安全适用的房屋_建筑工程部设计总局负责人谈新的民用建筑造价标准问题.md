According to the new cost standards for civil buildings recently stipulated, some people doubt whether it is possible to build apartment buildings or residences at a cost of less than 60 yuan per square meter, or whether the buildings constructed will be safe and suitable. On June 20th, our reporter interviewed a responsible person from the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, which is currently carrying out standard designs for civil buildings in various regions, regarding this issue.

The responsible person of the Design Bureau first stated: We have a completely scientific basis to explain that at a cost of less than 60 yuan per square meter, three- or four-story buildings can be built in different regions across the country, except for a few cities in extremely cold areas. In the past few days, based on the new economic indicators and taking into account the climate and price conditions of the Beijing area, we have made a preliminary design for a residential building. The cost per square meter of this building design, excluding off-site engineering, is 52 yuan (including water, electricity, and sanitation facilities). The entire design embodies the ideas of thrift, ensuring safety and suitability, being realistic, and breaking with convention. For example, for the exterior walls of buildings, in the past, various regions generally used the coldest climate of the year as the design basis. In reality, there are not many days with such cold weather each year. Therefore, if the exterior walls are designed according to normal climate conditions, a lot of funds can be saved. In the past, the lower two floors of buildings in Beijing were designed with 37 cm thick inner and outer walls, and the floors above were designed with 24 cm thick walls. Our new preliminary design changed the entire exterior wall of the building to 24 cm thick, which reduces the cost by 6 yuan and 6 fen per square meter. The past heating standards included the amount of heat needed to offset the cold wind entering through window gaps. The new preliminary design takes into account that residents can paste or seal the window gaps in winter, so the number of radiators can be reduced in the design; the heating pipes around the building are changed to straight corridor installations, and double pipes are changed to single pipes. In this way, the cost per square meter can be reduced by 3 yuan and 5 jiao and 5 fen. In addition, using lime and earth instead of rubble for the foundation can save 2 yuan and 4 jiao and 9 fen per square meter; thinning the concrete layers of floors and stairs; using reed mats instead of plywood or wooden strips for partition walls; using concrete slabs instead of wooden floors; using loess mud, yellow soil, and white lime instead of high-grade "casein" to plaster the walls; reducing the height of each floor from 3.2 or 3.4 meters to 3 meters; changing the old standard of separate toilets, kitchens, and bathrooms for each household to collectively used facilities; and taking various saving measures in terms of materials and equipment, it is entirely possible to build buildings at a cost of around 50 yuan per square meter.

The responsible person of the Design Bureau said: Buildings constructed using such standards can be used for fifty years. Builders and residents do not need to worry about their safety. The four-story hospital built with 24 cm thick walls in Hankou last year has proven to be a very safe building.

The responsible person of the Design Bureau also said: From the perspective of suitability, the apartment residences designed according to the new standards are suitable for our current living standards, and they are better than the conditions in which ordinary workers currently live. Simple heating equipment in the building can still keep the indoor temperature at 16 degrees Celsius. Regarding indoor ventilation and lighting, it is also suitable for people's living needs. Ventilation adopts natural ventilation methods, allowing air to convection. Lighting is still in accordance with the general standard of the past, that is, the window area is equal to one-eighth of the indoor ground. It can ensure that people can comfortably read, work, or rest at home. The top floor of the building uses sorghum stalks and reeds, which are produced in large quantities in our rural areas, instead of expensive cold-proof and heat-insulating materials, which can still keep out the cold and heat. Although concrete floors are not as warm as wooden floors, they are warmer in winter with heating or stoves, and cooler than wooden floors in summer. Only in the early winter and early spring when the heating and stoves are not burning or stopped, do they appear colder than wooden floors, but the time of this seasonal transition each year is very short. Regarding sound insulation, residents of the same floor will not feel uneasy with each other when using reed mats as partition walls. Only when there is a large movement upstairs will the downstairs be affected. However, in order to save funds for industrial construction and for a happy life in the future, the general state staff and the vast number of workers will also agree to lower some housing standards at present. In fact, many places now have residential buildings, even office buildings and school buildings, without sound insulation equipment, and people still live, work, and study well there, don't they? In the future, when the national industry is developed, these original buildings can also be improved on the original basis. For example, the sound insulation problem of buildings can be solved in the future by simply adding a layer of plywood.

The responsible person of the Design Bureau finally said: The cost per square meter of apartment residences designed according to the new standards has been reduced from about 90 yuan in the past to about 50 yuan, which can save a lot of construction funds for the country. According to general calculations, approximately 400 million yuan can be saved for every 10 million square meters of apartment buildings constructed. Wouldn't it be possible to save more funds if we build bungalows in small and medium-sized cities and distant suburbs using local materials, without heating and other modern equipment? Of course, under economic and suitable conditions, we should also strive for reasonable, neat, and beautiful arrangements in the layout and other aspects of buildings. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 根据新的造价标准能够建造安全适用的房屋——建筑工程部设计总局负责人谈新的民用建筑造价标准问题

    根据新的造价标准能够建造安全适用的房屋
    ——建筑工程部设计总局负责人谈新的民用建筑造价标准问题
    最近新的民用建筑造价标准规定以后，有些人怀疑每平方公尺六十元以内的造价，能不能盖楼房住宅或盖起来是否安全适用。六月二十日，本社记者就这一问题访问了目前正为各地进行民用建筑标准设计的建筑工程部设计总局的负责人。
    设计总局负责人首先说：我们完全有科学根据可以说明，每平方公尺造价在六十元以内，除严寒地区的少数城市外，在全国不同地区可以建造三四层的楼房。最近几天，我们根据新的经济指标，以北京地区的气候和物价等条件为根据，作出了一种住宅楼房的初步设计。这个楼房设计除宅外工程外，每平方公尺的造价是五十二元（包括水电卫生设备）。整个设计贯穿着节约、保证安全合用、实事求是和打破陈规的思想。例如楼房外墙，过去各地一般都以历年最冷的气候作为设计依据，实际上每年像那样冷的气候没有多少天。因此，外墙改按一般正常气候设计，就可以节省很多资金。北京过去的楼房下两层内外墙都按三十七公分厚设计，两层以上按二十四公分厚设计。我们作的新的初步设计，整个楼房外墙都改为二十四公分厚，这样每平方公尺的造价就可减少六元零六分。过去的采暖标准，都包括和窗缝里钻进的冷风对消的热量。新的初步设计，考虑到冬天居住者可以把窗缝糊住或塞住，因而在设计中可以减少暖气片；把绕在楼房周围的暖气管，改为直顺走廊铺设，并把双管改为单管。这样，每平方公尺造价可降低三元五角五分。另外，用灰土代替毛石打基础，每平方公尺造价可节省两元四角九分；减薄楼地板和楼梯的混凝土层，用苇箔代替万利板或木条作隔墙；用混凝土板代替木地板；用滑秸泥、黄土和白灰代替高级的“可赛因”粉刷墙壁；把每层楼的高度由三点二或三点四公尺减到三公尺；把旧标准每户单独的厕所、厨房、浴室改为集体使用的设备以及在材料和设备等方面采取各种节约措施，就完全可以保证在每平方公尺造价五十元左右盖起楼房来。
    设计总局负责人说：采用这样的标准建造的楼房，可以使用五十年。建筑者和居住者是不必担心它的安全的。去年在汉口用二十四公分厚的墙建成的四层楼医院，证明是很安全的建筑物。
    设计总局负责人还说：从适用的观点来说，根据新标准设计出来的楼房住宅，是适合我们现有生活水平的，它比一般工人现在居住的条件还要好些。楼房内简单的暖气设备，仍可使室内的温度保持在摄氏十六度。关于室内通风和采光，也适宜人们的生活需要，通风是采用自然通风的方法，使空气可以对流。采光仍按过去的一般标准，即窗户面积等于室内地面的八分之一。它可以保证人们在家里舒适的读书、工作或休息。楼房的顶层，用我国农村大量出产的高粱秆和芦苇等，代替贵重的防寒隔热材料，这样仍然可以御寒防热。混凝土的楼地板虽然没有木地板暖和，但冬天有暖气或火炉，夏季它比木地板凉快，只是在初冬和春初不烧或停烧暖气和火炉的时候，才显得比用木地板冷些，但每年这个季节交接的时间是很短的。关于隔音，用苇箔作隔墙，同层楼的住户，不会彼此感到不安静。只有楼上发生过大的动作时，楼下才受些影响。不过，为了节省资金建设工业，为了将来的幸福生活，目前降低一些住宅标准，一般国家工作人员和广大职工，也是会赞成的。事实上，现在好多地方的住宅，甚至是办公室，学校建筑也是没有隔音设备的，人们在那里不是也生活、工作和学习得很好吗？将来国家工业发达了，这些原有的建筑也是可以在原有的基础上加以改进的。例如楼房的隔音问题，将来只要镶上一层万利板就可以解决。
    设计总局负责人最后说：按照新的标准设计的楼房住宅，每平方公尺的造价由过去的九十元左右降低到五十元左右，就可以为国家节省大量的建设资金。据一般计算，每建筑一千万平方公尺面积的楼房，就可节省大约四亿元资金。如果在中小城市和远郊区就地取材建造平房，不用暖气等现代化设备，不是更可以节约更多的资金吗？当然，在经济和适用的条件下，我们在建筑物的布置等方面也应力求合理、整齐和美观。（新华社）
