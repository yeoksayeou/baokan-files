    苏联工程专家们到达印度帮助建立炼钢厂
    缅甸政府聘请苏联专家设计国际博览会建筑
    新华社新德里十一日电　据最近一期的“新世纪”周报报道，前来印度帮助印度建立炼钢厂的苏联高级工程专家们已经在六月二日到预定的炼钢厂所在地——中央省的比莱去实地研究建立炼钢厂的计划。
    苏联专家们在接见“新世纪”周报记者时说，现在已经作好准备，来开始进行初步的计划工作。一队苏联专家包括地质学家、水文学家、地形学家、运输专家等已经完成了他们在比莱的准备工作。
    率领这批苏联专家的尼古拉·克拉钦科说，“我们将把我们所有的经验和知识完全用在这个新的工程上去。”
    根据印度和苏联签订的协定，苏联工程师们将在一九五五年十二月十五日以前向印度政府提出关于这个炼钢厂的最后的技术报告。在这个报告取得同意以后，这个炼钢厂的大规模的建筑工程就将在一九五六年春天开始进行。这个炼钢厂预定在一九五九年十二月全部投入生产，到那时每年可以生产七十二万吨钢，二十万吨钢板，十万吨生铁。
    新华社十日讯　仰光消息：据缅甸政府发表的公报说，缅甸政府聘请了苏联建筑专家安德烈耶夫、基斯洛娃、雷滋特安等到缅甸，为预订在一九五六年底在仰光举行的国际博览会的建筑进行设计。专家们在考察了曼德勒、勃固等地的缅甸民族建筑后，现在正和缅甸房屋建筑部的官员们进行研究和设计中。建筑计划将包括一个国际博览会展览馆，一座共有二百五十个房间的大旅馆，一个现代化的游泳池，以及一个大运动场。
