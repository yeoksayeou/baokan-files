    Can Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives Open Restaurants?
    Question: Can agricultural producers' cooperatives open restaurants and bicycle repair shops? In some small towns or villages with heavy pedestrian traffic, passing travelers greatly need restaurants and repair shops to solve their travel difficulties. These towns are gradually becoming cooperative, and if agricultural producers' cooperatives do not operate these shops, passing travelers will experience great inconvenience. How should this problem be solved? Wang Hongli

    Answer: Agricultural producers' cooperatives cannot engage in speculative commerce, and generally speaking, operating restaurants and bicycle repair shops is also unnecessary. As agriculture gradually becomes cooperative, people who operate restaurants and bicycle repair shops can continue to operate their own shops without having to join agricultural producers' cooperatives. If they are unable to cultivate their own land, they can also be allowed to rent the land to the cooperative if they wish. As for some towns where people who operated restaurants and bicycle repair shops have already changed professions and no one is continuing their operations, in this case, in order to meet the needs of the people's lives and production and to facilitate passing travelers, agricultural producers' cooperatives can open restaurants or bicycle repair shops, provided that it does not hinder agricultural production.

    农业生产合作社能不能开饭铺
    问：农业生产合作社是否可以开设饭铺和修理自行车铺？在一些小乡镇或来往行人较多的村庄，过往旅客很需要有饭铺、修车铺等，解决他们旅途中的困难。这些乡镇都要逐步合作化了，农业生产合作社如果不经营这些店铺，过往旅客就会感到极大不便。这种问题应该怎样解决？　　　　王鸿利
    答：农业生产合作社是不能经营投机商业的，经营饭铺和修自行车铺，一般说也是不必要的。农业要逐步合作化，开饭铺和修自行车铺的人仍然可以继续经营自己的铺子，不必参加农业生产合作社。如果他们无法经营自己的土地，愿意将土地出租给社，也可以允许。至于在一些乡镇里，由于开饭铺和修自行车铺的人已经转业，无人继续他们的经营；在这种情况下，为了满足人民生活和生产上的需要，便利过往行人，农业生产合作社在不妨碍农业生产的条件下，开设饭铺或修自行车铺，是可以的。
