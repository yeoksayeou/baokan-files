Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps will establish five tractor repair and assembly plants with modern mechanical equipment in the reclamation areas of Urumqi, Aksu, Yanqi, Shihezi, and Pao-tai this year. Most of the various machine tools and equipment have already been transported to the sites by the end of May. The tractor repair and assembly plant being built in the Urumqi reclamation area has completed its factory buildings and is installing water and heating equipment and planning the installation of machine tools. It is expected to go into production in July. The other four reclamation area repair and assembly plants are under active construction and preparation.

These five tractor repair and assembly plants will each have fifteen to sixteen workshops, equipped with more than 150 types of machines and special equipment, all powered by electricity. After these five repair and assembly plants are completed, they will adopt the advanced Soviet assembly line method and will be able to overhaul 300 to 350 various types of tractors and 100 to 125 combine harvesters annually. They can also repair various agricultural implements and manufacture various parts needed for agricultural machinery. The repair and assembly plants in the Aksu and Yanqi reclamation areas are also preparing to add honing workshops in order to carry out partial overhauls of tractors.

    新疆将建立五个拖拉机修配厂
    新疆军区生产建设部队今年将在乌鲁木齐、阿克苏、焉耆、石河天、炮台等垦区建立五个具有现代机械设备的拖拉机修配厂。各种机床、器材已经在今年五月底大部运到现场。建立在乌鲁木齐垦区的拖拉机修配厂，厂房已经修建完工，正在安装水暖设备和筹划装置机床，预计七月间即可投入生产。其他四个垦区的修配厂正在积极施工和筹建中。
    这五座拖拉机修配厂将各有十五个到十六个工作车间，装置各种机器和专用设备一百五十多种，完全用电力发动。这五座修配厂建成以后，采用苏联的先进流水作业法，每年可中修各种类型的拖拉机三百到三百五十台、联合收割机一百到一百二十五台，还可以修理各种农具和制造农业机器需用的各种零件。阿克苏和焉耆垦区的修配厂还准备增设搪磨车间，以便进行拖拉机的部分大修。
