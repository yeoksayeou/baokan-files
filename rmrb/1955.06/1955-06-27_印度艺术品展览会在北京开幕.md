Xinhua News Agency, June 26th. An Indian Art Exhibition opened on June 26th at the waterside pavilion in Zhongshan Park, Beijing.

The exhibition is sponsored by the Sino-Indian Friendship Association and the Chinese Artists Association. On display are more than 370 Indian art pieces, including sculptures, paintings, silverware, bronzes, lacquerware, and textiles. Among them are handicrafts such as the silver bowl, silver fish, and cigarette case presented to Chairman Mao by the Indian government and people; four volumes of ancient murals presented to Premier Zhou Enlai by Prime Minister Nehru; the "Sino-Indian Friendship Flower" that citizens of New Delhi personally attached to Premier Zhou Enlai; and a hand-spinning wheel presented to the Chinese people by the people of Gandhi Village, the hometown of Gandhi. From these exquisite works of art, people can see the brilliant achievements of the Indian people, who have a long cultural tradition, in the field of art.

The vast majority of the exhibited artworks are gifts presented to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and Chinese delegations visiting India by the Indian government, people's organizations, and the people over the years. There are also precious gifts brought by Indian friends who were invited to visit our country. All the exhibits displayed here demonstrate the profound friendship between the peoples of China and India.

Also on display are more than 110 photographs, vividly recording Prime Minister Nehru's and the Indian cultural delegation's visit to China.
