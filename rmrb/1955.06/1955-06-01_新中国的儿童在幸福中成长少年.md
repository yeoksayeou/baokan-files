    Children's Books are Becoming More Abundant
    From October 1949 to May 1955, over 2,800 types of children's books were published nationwide, with over 60 million copies printed (excluding comic books). These books are printed exquisitely, and most of them are illustrated.
    In recent years, Chinese writers have created many excellent children's books. The five works that won the first prize in the "National Children's Literature Creation Awards for the Past Four Years" held in 1954 have been widely circulated among young readers. Among them, Zhang Tianyi's "The Story of Luo Wenyin" has been printed six times, with a circulation of over 100,000 copies; Gao Shiqi's "Our Soil Mother" has been printed five times, with a circulation of 56,000 copies; and Feng Xuefeng's "Lu Xun and His Childhood Friends" has been printed eight times, with a circulation of over 150,000 copies. Young readers especially love books describing the deeds of revolutionary heroes, and these books have been consistently popular. Young readers have a wide range of interests, and books on history, geography, and natural science published by the Children's Publishing House have been warmly welcomed.
    Excellent foreign children's books are also being translated into Chinese in large quantities. Over the past five years, more than 850 types have been published, with over 12 million copies printed. About 30 of the works of famous Soviet writers Ilyin and Gaidar have been translated into Chinese and published. Ilyin's "100,000 Whys" has been printed 16 times; Gaidar's "Chuk and Gek" and "Timur and His Team" are also available in Chinese translations. More than 320,000 copies of Chinese translations of more than ten works by the world-renowned Danish fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen have been distributed. The publication volume of Chinese translations of folk tales from various countries is also increasing day by day. Books published this year include Bing Xin's translation of "Indian Fairy Tales."

    Fuxin Exhibits Handicraft Works by Children
    The "Science and Technology Handicraft Works Exhibition of Children" recently held in Fuxin City has aroused great interest among the audience. The exhibition displayed more than 300 works by students from 34 primary schools and some junior high school first and second graders in the city.
    Most of these students are children of coal mine workers, and a large part of their works reflect the scenes of production and construction in the mining area and the lives of coal miners. The model of the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine made by Zhao Guonian, Yang Enqing, and other students from Taiping Complete Primary School left a deep impression on people. The model is meticulous and lifelike. As soon as the button is turned on, the small electric locomotive will run on the track, and the small electric shovel will open its mouth to bite the black coal. Students from Ping'an Coal Mine Complete Primary School made a model of the Ping'an Shaft. Students from Xinqiu Coal Mine Complete Primary School made a sectional model of the inclined shaft. These works by the children fully demonstrate their love for coal mine production work, just as they said: We love the work and labor of our fathers and brothers, we must be familiar with the coal mine and learn from them. The exhibition also displayed models of telegraph machines, electric motors, cranes, etc. made by primary school students, as well as embroidery, portraits, woodcuts, plaster statues and other works.

    A Primary School in Hankou Establishes a Children's Factory
    Hankou No. 26 Primary School has arranged an after-school activity place for students called "Children's Factory." This "factory" is divided into "workshops" such as carpentry, teaching aids, and sewing. Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon during after-school activity time, a group of small "workers" enter these "workshops" to carry out activities. Some are concentrating on making Kongming lanterns and human physiological models, some are using waste wood to make small curtain racks, some are sewing fly swatters and bags, and some are making dolls and other toys.
    The "Children's Factory" was established on April 13, 1955. It has enriched the after-school life of students and has become a powerful assistant for teachers to conduct labor education for children. Some students used to go to nearby comic book stalls to read bizarre knight-errant novels after class, or fight on the streets; now they participate in "workshop" activities and have changed their past bad habits. Some students have initially developed the habit of loving labor and cherishing public property.
    Recently, Li Wenlan, Guo Yunhai and others from the fifth grade class two used waste materials to make a slide projector, preparing to participate in the handicraft exhibition to be held on "June 1."

    Children's Cinema in Changchun is Packed with Audience
    China's first children's cinema, located in Changchun, has now been moved to a new site and has been renovated and decorated. It has become the best cinema in Changchun.
    All of the one thousand seats in this children's cinema are small red leather chairs suitable for children's height. A reading room, game room, and rest room that can accommodate more than 200 children at the same time have been set up around the projection room. More than 400 new books and magazines are placed on the round small tables in the reading room. Interesting toys are displayed in the game room.
    Since its opening on New Year's Day in 1954, the Children's Cinema has received more than 520,000 child viewers from the city and suburbs. The attendance rate of the cinema is higher than that of all cinemas in Changchun. Children come here to watch movies, and the ticket price is more than 50% lower than that of ordinary cinemas. Especially poor children can enter for free with a letter of introduction.
    Three full-time counselors in the Children's Cinema often explain the content of the film to the children during the rest time, and go deep into the primary schools to study the children's opinions on the film.

    Children in Xishuangbanna are Growing Up Healthily
    In Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, infants and young children are growing up very well. There are more than 35,000 people in Mengzhe, Banna, of whom more than 9,000 are infants born after liberation. The People's Government has established two maternal and child health stations and two midwifery stations in the central areas of Jinghong, Mengzhe, Menghai and Yiwu, and has trained a group of Dai female midwives to regularly provide midwifery services for women of all ethnic groups and carry out maternal and child health propaganda. Many women in various places have begun to use sanitary belts and implement prenatal examinations, and most of the children born can be raised. In Manluandian Village, Jinghong, Banna, there is a Dai woman named Yu Yang who gave birth to four children before liberation, but none of them survived. When she gave birth to her fifth child last year, the midwife used a new method to deliver the child and saved the stillborn child. Now the child is growing up very healthily.

    Yanbian Korean Children Live a Happy Life
    The children of farmers in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, are living a happy life. The autonomous prefecture now has nearly 50,000 health care and education workers directly serving the children. Last year, more than 6,400 babies were born after regular prenatal examinations and new-style midwifery. The survival rate of infants in the region has reached about 97%.
    Infants can be sent to "childcare groups" or "nurseries" as soon as they are two months old, so mothers can work with peace of mind. In recent years, more than 90% of women of all ethnic groups in Yanbian have participated in labor production. Every year, children's medical staff conduct free physical examinations for infants in various parts of the autonomous region, and inoculate them with smallpox vaccine, BCG vaccine, and injections to prevent various diseases according to different seasons. Diseases that pose the greatest threat to infant growth, such as "measles," "whooping cough," and "pneumonia," have been reduced year by year, and smallpox has been eradicated.
    There are 743 rural kindergartens in the region, which are responsible for accommodating children aged three to seven. After the children enter elementary school, they can use their ethnic language and script to study all the way to middle school and university.

    Many Tibetan and Yi Children Wear Red Scarves
    In Xikang Province, more than 480 children of Tibetan, Yi, Hui and other ethnic groups have worn red scarves. From the Kangzang Plateau to the southern mountainous area, there are youth pioneer organizations in many places.
    The youth pioneer teams in various places often visit factories, have parties with model workers in industry and agriculture, travel, and hold team meetings on various themes, which have increased the children's knowledge. This spring, the members of the National Primary School in Luhuo County traveled to Ganzi and visited hospitals, the "August 1st" Auditorium, and farms, and saw new agricultural tools, tractors, and many other things they had never seen before. The members of Kangding, Daofu, Luhuo and other counties have also universally launched activities to communicate with the volunteer army uncles and the People's Liberation Army uncles. Many members have been encouraged by the replies from the uncles and have become students with excellent grades. In areas where ethnic groups such as Huili and Mianning live together, members of various ethnic groups often hold parties, friendship ball games, and visits.

    阜新展览少年儿童工艺作品
    阜新市最近举行的“少年儿童科学技术工艺作品展览会”引起了观众的极大兴趣。展览会上展出了全市三十四个小学和一部分初中一、二年级学生的作品，共有三百多件。
    这些学生大部分是煤矿职工的子弟，作品有很大一部分也是表现矿区生产建设的情景和煤矿工人的生活。太平完全小学学生赵国念、杨恩庆等制作的海州露天煤矿模型给人们留下了深刻的印象，模型作得细致和逼真，只要一开动电钮，小小的电机车就会在轨道上奔跑，小小的电铲也会张开大口啃着乌黑的煤块。平安煤矿完小学生制作了平安竖井的模型。新邱煤矿完小学生作了斜井断面模型。孩子们的这些作品充分说明了他们对煤矿生产工作的热爱，正如他们说的：我们热爱爸爸、哥哥的工作和劳动，我们就要熟悉煤矿，向他们学习。展览会还展出了小学生们作的电报机、电动机、起重机等模型和刺绣、画像、木刻、石膏塑像等作品。                      （新华社）
    汉口一个小学成立儿童工厂
    汉口第二十六小学为学生安排了一个被叫做
  “儿童工厂”的课余活动场所。这个“工厂”里分设有木工、教具和缝纫等“工场”。每到星期二和星期四下午的课余活动时间，一群小“工人”就分别进入这些“工场”展开活动，有的在聚精会神地制作孔明灯和人体生理模型，有的在利用废木料制造小窗帘架，有的缝制扑灭苍蝇的拍子和袋子，还有的在制作洋娃娃等各种玩具。
      “儿童工厂”是在一九五五年四月十三日成立的。它丰富了学生们的课余生活，并成为教师对儿童进行劳动教育的有力助手。有些学生过去下课后常到附近的小人书摊看怪诞的剑侠小说，或者到街上打架；现在他们参加了“工场”的活动，改变了过去的坏习惯。有些学生已初步养成了热爱劳动和爱护公共财物的习惯。
    最近五年级二班李文澜和郭云海等人利用废料制造了一架幻灯放映机，准备参加将在“六一”举行的工艺品展览。　　（新华社）
    长春市儿童电影院观众踊跃

    延边朝鲜族儿童过幸福生活
    吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区农民的孩子们，正在过着幸福的生活。自治区现在有将近五万名的卫生医疗和教育工作人员，直接为孩子们服务。去年，经过定期产前检查和新法接生的婴儿就有六千四百多名。全区婴儿的成活率已达到百分之九十七左右。
    婴儿们出生刚满两个月，就可以送到“带孩子组”或“托儿所”，母亲们因此能够安心劳动。几年来延边各族妇女有百分之九十以上参加了劳动生产。每年，儿童医疗工作人员免费给自治区各地的婴儿进行身体检查，按不同的季节接种痘苗、卡介苗以及注射各种疾病预防针。对婴儿成长威胁最大的“麻疹”、“百日咳”、“肺炎”等疾病已经逐年减少，天花病已经根绝。

    许多藏彝族儿童系上红领巾
    西康省已有四百八十多个藏、彝、回等民族的儿童戴上了红领巾，从康藏高原到南部山区，不少地方都有了少年先锋队的组织。
    各地的少年先锋队经常参观工厂，和工农业劳动模范联欢，旅行及举行各种题材的队会，使儿童们增加了许多知识。炉霍县民族小学的队员们今年春天旅行到甘孜，参观了医院、“八一”礼堂和农场，看到了新式农具、拖拉机等许多从来没有见过的东西。康定、道孚、炉霍等县的队员们，还普遍展开了和志愿军叔叔、解放军叔叔通信的活动，许多队员受到叔叔们回信的鼓舞，成为成绩优良的学生。在会理、冕宁等民族杂居地区，各民族队员之间时常举行联欢、友谊球赛和进行访问。                              （新华社）
