Heilongjiang and other Public Security Organs
Uncovered a Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent Organization Based on Mass Tips
In the winter of 1951, the people of Yutian County, Hebei Province, reported to the public security organs that Fei Zhaoju (a rogue and habitual thief), who had returned to Yutian County from the Northeast to visit relatives, was spreading rumors in his hometown and was also colluding with landlord elements who had been struggled against to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Based on this clue provided by the people, the public security organs of Heilongjiang Province and other places, after a long period of investigation, ascertained Fei Zhaoju's purpose in carrying out counter-revolutionary activities and the series of counter-revolutionary crimes committed by his instigators and accomplices, and uncovered a special agent group called "Kuomintang Shenyang Underground Executive Group" lurking inside our several national defense industries and organs. Now the main and accessory criminals of this special agent organization, Zhang Kun, Dong Yiwu, Li Chunyuan, Fei Zhaoju and other twelve special agents have all been captured by us, and in the face of conclusive evidence found by our public security organs, they have confessed to all their crimes.

As early as before the liberation of Shenyang, Chiang Kai-shek’s "Ministry of National Defense Security Bureau" special agent Zhang Kun (Chiang Kai-shek's major officer) received instructions from Chiang Kai-shek’s special agent organs to remain on the mainland to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. After the liberation of Shenyang, the special agent Zhang Kun concealed his reactionary history, changed his name to Zhang Jiming, and infiltrated our factory as an electrician under the guise of an electrical worker. Subsequently, under the cover of his public profession, Zhang gathered Chiang Kai-shek’s special agents Dong Yiwu (leader of Chiang Kai-shek’s intelligence team), Li Chunyuan (Chiang Kai-shek’s officer), Tong Enhuan (Chiang Kai-shek’s ruffian soldier) and others, who were hidden in several of our factories, and formed the "Kuomintang Shenyang Underground Executive Group," under which were set up intelligence, armed and other organizations. Zhang Kun himself served as the secretary, Dong Yiwu served as the deputy secretary, and they decided to develop special agents and organize reactionary armed forces separately. They also stipulated that they should pretend to be "active" and "ideologically progressive" on the surface in order to deceive the masses and win the trust of the leadership, so as to facilitate their counter-revolutionary activities.

They successively developed Chiang Kai-shek element Wei Jimin, who had wormed his way into our Party, and reactionary elements Liu Minghai, Zhang Xixian, Fei Zhaoju, Xia Shusen and more than ten others to join their special agent organization, and vigorously collected intelligence, spread rumors, and disrupted social order.

Special agent Zhang Kun once conspired to instigate our armed police guards to rebel against the revolution, and once conspired to assassinate our national leaders when they visited the factory. Special agents Tong Enhuan and Fei Zhaoju had secretly monitored the director and security section chief of our factory for a long time, attempting to harm them. Special agent Li Chunyuan once instructed special agent Xia Shusen to pretend to be active and repeatedly asked to join the Chinese Communist Party, attempting to infiltrate the Party to carry out sabotage activities.

When the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, these special agents believed that "the time had come" and immediately made so-called "preparations for dawn." Zhang Kun, Dong Yiwu and other criminals convened five "emergency meetings," formulated so-called "action plans" to collect our military intelligence, collect hidden guns, expand the special agent organization, "incite defection" of our armed police guards, and assassinate our responsible personnel. They stipulated "group code names," secret aliases for each criminal's liaison, and drafted a so-called "Proclamation to the People of the Northeast," vainly attempting to cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "recovery of the mainland."

At this time, in 1951, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries began. These special agents, fearing exposure, immediately dispersed and carried out activities. They determined to use special agent Tong Enhuan, who was entrenched in a factory in Shenyang, as the liaison center, and Tong was responsible for keeping the radio transceiver and other documents, so that they could contact Chiang Kai-shek's special agent organs in Hong Kong and Taiwan when necessary. Other special agents took advantage of loopholes in the personnel system of some of our organs and factories, and transferred to carry out covert activities separately. Special agent ringleader Zhang Kun, under the pretext of labor employment and willingness to develop the border areas, went from Shenyang to Xinjiang and infiltrated a factory in Xinjiang as a "technician." Special agent Dong Yiwu, through the introduction of special agent Wei Jimin (who had infiltrated Guangzhou as the secretary of a bureau chief in the industrial and commercial sector), infiltrated the General Affairs Section of the Guangdong Provincial Finance Committee as a "staff member." Special agents Li Chunyuan, Liu Minghai, Xia Shusen and others infiltrated some of our factories in Heilongjiang Province to lie dormant. Fei Zhaoju roamed around Shenyang, Hebei and other places, secretly carrying out counter-revolutionary activities. After infiltrating our factories and organs, these special agents played two-faced tricks. On the one hand, they pretended to be active in order to gain a foothold, while at the same time, they inquired about intelligence, made friends widely, and sought out people of poor character or low political consciousness for their secret use and as targets for future development as special agents.

After 1952, these special agents saw that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries had passed, and vigilance in all aspects seemed to be gradually slackening, so their counter-revolutionary activities became more active. At this time, special agent Xia Shusen traveled frequently between Guangzhou, Shenyang, Harbin and other places to actively plan concrete issues for various counter-revolutionary activities. However, the wild fantasies of these counter-revolutionary elements can never be realized. Just as they were preparing to carry out large-scale counter-revolutionary criminal activities, our people's public security organs completely uncovered this special agent organization and lawfully arrested the twelve criminals lurking in Heilongjiang, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Xinjiang and other places.

    黑龙江等地公安机关
    根据群众检举破获了一个蒋贼特务组织
    一九五一年冬，河北省玉田县人民群众向公安机关检举说：从东北回到玉田县探亲的费兆举（流氓惯窃），在家乡散布谣言，并且拉拢被斗争过的地主分子进行反革命活动。根据人民检举的这个线索，黑龙江省及其他地方的公安机关经过长期侦察，查明了费兆举进行反革命活动的目的及其指使者、同谋者所进行的一系列反革命罪行，破获了潜伏在我若干国防工业和机关内部的一个名为“国民党沈阳地下执行小组”的特务集团。现在这个特务组织的主、从犯张昆、董益武、李春元、费兆举等十二名特务分子，都被我捕获，并在我公安机关查获的确凿证据面前，供认了他们的全部罪行。
    早在沈阳解放前夕，蒋贼“国防部保密局”特务张昆（蒋贼少校军官）就接受了蒋贼特务机关的指示，潜留大陆，进行反革命活动。沈阳解放后，特务张昆隐瞒了反动历史，化名张继铭，以电气工人身份混进了我某工厂充当电工。随后，张犯以公开职业为掩护，网罗了隐藏在我若干工厂的蒋贼特务董益武（蒋贼谍报组长）、李春元（蒋贼军官）、佟恩焕（蒋贼兵痞）等，成立了“国民党沈阳地下执行小组”，下设情报、武装等组织，张昆自任书记，董益武任副书记，并确定分头发展特务分子，组织反动武装。他们并规定要表面伪装“积极”、“思想进步”，以蒙蔽群众耳目，取得领导信任，便于进行反革命活动。
    他们先后发展了钻进我党内的蒋贼分子魏济民，发展了反动分子刘明海、张希贤、费兆举、夏树森等十多名加入其特务组织，并大肆搜集情报，散布谣言，扰乱社会治安。
    特务张昆曾经阴谋策动我某警卫武装叛变革命，并曾经阴谋趁我国家领导人员参观工厂时，实行刺杀。特务佟恩焕、费兆举曾经长期暗中监视我某厂厂长、保卫科长等人，企图加以暗害。特务李春元曾经指使特务夏树森伪装积极，多次要求加入中国共产党，企图钻入党内进行破坏活动。
    当美帝国主义者发动侵朝战争初期，这些特务分子认为“时机已到”，立即作了所谓“黎明前的准备”，由张昆、董益武等犯召开了五次“紧急会议”，制定了搜集我军事情报，收集隐藏的枪枝，扩大特务组织，“策反”我某警卫武装，刺杀我负责人员等的所谓“行动计划”，规定了“小组代号”、各犯秘密联络的化名，草拟了所谓“告东北同胞书”，妄图配合蒋贼的所谓“收复大陆”。
    正在这时，一九五一年，镇压反革命运动开始了。这些特务分子惟恐暴露面目，就立即分散进行活动。他们确定以钻在沈阳某工厂的特务佟恩焕为联络中心，并由佟犯保管收发报机和其它文件，以便在必要时和香港、台湾的蒋贼特务机关联系。其它特务分子则利用我某些机关、工厂人事制度不严密的漏洞，又分别转移进行潜伏。特务头子张昆以劳动就业、愿去开发边疆为名，由沈阳到了新疆，混入新疆某厂充当“技术员”。特务董益武则通过已经钻进党内的特务魏济民（潜入广州市任工商部门某局长的秘书）的介绍，钻进广东省财委会总务科充任“科员”。特务李春元、刘明海、夏树森等混入黑龙江省我某些工厂潜伏。费兆举则流窜于沈阳、河北等地，秘密进行反革命活动。这些特务分子潜入我工厂、机关之后，都玩弄两面手法，一方面伪装积极来站稳脚根，同时刺探情报，广交朋友，物色品质不好或政治觉悟不高的人，供他们暗中利用，并作为将来发展特务的对象。
    一九五二年以后，这些特务分子看到镇压反革命运动已经过去，各方面的警惕似渐松懈，他们的反革命活动便转趋积极。这时，特务夏树森多次奔走于广州、沈阳、哈尔滨等地进行联络，积极策划各种反革命活动的具体问题。但是，这些反革命分子的狂妄幻想是永远不能实现的，当他们正准备大肆进行反革命罪恶活动时，我人民公安机关就全部破获了这个特务组织，依法逮捕了潜伏在黑龙江、沈阳、广州、新疆等地的十二名罪犯。
