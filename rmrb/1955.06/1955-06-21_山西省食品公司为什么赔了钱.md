Why Did the Shanxi Provincial Food Company Lose Money?
	Gao Shuzhi Wu Guangyi

	The Shanxi Provincial Food Company was established in April 1954, and by the end of the year, its losses amounted to 872,000 yuan.

	Some people say that the reason for last year's losses was mainly due to the newness of the organization and incomplete equipment, among other things. Is this really the case? Let's look at some of the situations that the inspection team organized by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce and relevant units recently discovered! In August last year, the Ningwu County Food Company's receiving and transporting station drove more than 500 cattle to graze on the Wu'jialing mountain top. When it rained, the cattle herders hurriedly tied the cattle to birch trees on the mountain top and rushed back to the village to take shelter from the rain. It rained for three or four consecutive days, and the receiving and transporting station didn't send anyone up the mountain to check on them even once. By the time the rain stopped and the weather cleared, 51 cattle had died on the mountain, 8 cattle were missing, and more than 23 mu of farmers' crops had been trampled. Afterwards, the losses, including deaths, missing cattle, and compensation to farmers for their crops, amounted to more than 5,600 yuan. This receiving and transporting station was also irresponsible in transferring live pigs. Regardless of the actual weight, they vaguely calculated the weight at an average of 120 jin per pig. After being transferred to the designated location, 8 percent was deducted for losses. In reality, the average weight of each live pig was over 135 jin. This caused a significant loss. Coupled with various accidents, the annual loss reached as high as 50,000 yuan. The Shuoxian and Pinglu County Food Company's receiving and transporting stations once transferred 316 boxes of fresh eggs to Taiyuan. After the goods were delivered to the station, no one went to complete the shipping procedures for more than a month. By the time they were transported to Taiyuan, 870 jin had dried up and rotted. The Shuoxian Food Company's receiving and transporting station entrusted an agricultural production cooperative to manage and raise sheep. A total of 1,335 sheep died successively, but the director of the receiving and transporting station never went to the countryside to investigate the cause. The Yuci Food Company once received 70 cattle transported by land from southern Shanxi. That night, no one was assigned to be responsible, and the feeder, Luo Shun, sent 16 bundles of grain stalks and threw them in the yard, then locked the gate and left. The next morning, when they went to check, the batch of cattle had already stiffened into a pile due to mutual squeezing. After emergency treatment, 22 still died. In addition, some branch companies transported fruits in the cold season without considering antifreeze measures, and entire truckloads of fruit were frozen and spoiled more than once. All of these losses were obviously caused by a lack of basic responsibility. This, after all, has no great relationship to whether the organization is new or old, or whether the equipment is complete or not.

	Moreover, the Shanxi Provincial Food Company also has examples that prove that the age of the organization and the completeness of the equipment are not the key issues in good or bad management. The Tunliu Food Company's receiving and transporting station is not an old organization, but in one year, thanks to the fact that all employees established a sense of responsibility for protecting state property, frequently learned from pig-raising farmers the experience of raising and caring for live pigs, carried out labor competitions, and strengthened feeding, care, and transportation, most employees transformed from amateurs into experts, saving more than 2,057 yuan in circulation costs. Not only did no live pigs die, but they also gained more than 16,170 jin in weight.

	So, where does the crux of the Shanxi Provincial Food Company's losses lie? According to this inspection, the most important problem is the lack of political education for employees. The staff has serious thoughts about belittling food work, thinking that working in the food company is "shameful." Many staff members believe that they have "participated in the revolution for many years, and still deal with pigs, cattle, and sheep, which is useless." Some staff members of the Changzhi Food Company said: "Every day, it's pigs before, pigs after, pigs left, pigs right, what can we learn!" Some cadres were transferred to work in the food company and were reluctant to take office. These comrades did not realize that food work is also an indispensable part of the national economy. It is connected to the daily life of hundreds of millions of people, related to the accumulation of funds for socialist construction and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. Just imagine, if they don't understand the significance of their work, how can these comrades do their job well?

	The leaders of the Shanxi Provincial Food Company have not promptly inspected and dealt with the serious chaos in business management and the dereliction of duty of some staff members. Although the losses were obviously very large, last November, they calculated a "surplus of more than 130,000 yuan" based on something unknown. The leadership became "optimistic" about this, and this serious chaos in work was not corrected in time. Therefore, the more they went on, the more money they lost.

	The Shanxi Provincial Food Company must strengthen political and ideological work, establish and improve the responsibility system, and quickly reverse the situation of losses based on the problems found in this inspection.

    山西省食品公司为什么赔了钱
    高树帜  吴广义
    山西省食品公司是一九五四年四月成立的，到年终决算时，亏损了八十七万二千多元。
    有些人说，去年所以赔钱，主要原因是机构新建不久，设备不全等等。事实真是这样的吗？请看最近山西省商业厅和有关单位组织的检查组检查出来的一些情况吧！宁武县食品公司接运处，去年八月间，把五百多头牛赶到吴家岭山头去放牧。天下雨了，这些赶牛的人急忙把牛拴到山头桦树上，便赶回村子里去避雨。雨一连下了三四天，接运处也没有派人上山看一次。等到雨过天晴，已有五十一头牛死在山上，八头牛失踪，还践踏了农民庄稼二十三亩多。事后，连死亡、失踪带赔偿农民庄稼就损失了五千六百多元。这个接运处外调生猪也是不负责任的，他们不管究竟实重多少，糊里糊涂按每头平均一百二十斤计算，调运到指定地点后，再扣出百分之八的损耗，实际平均每口生猪约重一百三十五斤多，这就造成了很大的亏损，加上各种各样的事故，全年亏损达五万元之多。朔县、平鲁两县食品公司接运处有一次往太原调鲜蛋三百一十六箱，待把货送到车站后，一个多月都没有人去办交运手续，赶运到太原就干耗和臭烂了八百七十斤。朔县食品公司接运处委托农业生产合作社保管饲养的羊，先后死亡一千三百三十五只，而接运处主任一直没有下乡检查过是什么原因。榆次食品公司一次收到晋南由旱路赶来的七十头牛，当晚不指定专人负责，饲养员罗顺管送去十六捆谷草扔到院里，就把大门一关扬长而去。第二天早晨去看，这一批牛因互相挤压已僵死成一堆了；经过急救，还是死掉了二十二头。此外，有的分公司严寒季节调运水果不考虑防冻设施，整车水果被冻坏的事也不止发生过一次。所有这些损失，显然是由于缺乏起码的责任心而造成的；这同机构新旧、设备全不全，毕竟没有太大的关系。
    而且山西省食品公司也有这样的例子可以证明，机构新旧、设备周不周，并不是经营好坏的关键问题。屯留食品公司接运处并不是老机构，但在一年之中，由于全体职工树立了爱护国家财产的责任心，经常向养猪农民学习饲养保管生猪的经验，开展了劳动竞赛，加强了饲养、保管和赶运，大部分职工都由外行变成内行，节约了流转费用二千零五十七元多，不仅没有发生生猪死亡现象，而且长肉增重一万六千一百七十多斤。
    那末，山西省食品公司赔钱的症结在哪里呢？据这次检查证明，最主要的问题是没有对职工进行政治教育，工作人员中有严重的轻视食品工作的思想，认为在食品公司工作“丢人”。不少工作人员认为自己“参加革命多年，还同猪、牛、羊打交道，没出息”。长治食品公司有的工作人员说：“每日猪前猪后，猪左猪右，能学出什么来！”有的干部被调到食品公司工作，迟迟不愿到职。这些同志没有认识到食品工作，同样是国民经济生活中不可缺少的部分，它联系着亿万人民的日常生活，关系着社会主义建设的资金积累和工农联盟的巩固。试想，不了解自己工作的意义，这些同志们怎么能做好工作呢？
    山西省食品公司领导人员对经营管理中的严重混乱现象和某些工作人员的失职，一直没有及时检查处理，明明亏损很大，去年十一月份不知根据什么，却累算出“盈余十三万多元”来，领导上还为此“乐观”起来，工作中这种严重的混乱现象，便没有及时纠正，因此，越往后赔钱越多。
    山西省食品公司必须根据这次检查出来的问题，加强政治思想工作，建立和健全责任制度，迅速扭转赔钱的情况。
