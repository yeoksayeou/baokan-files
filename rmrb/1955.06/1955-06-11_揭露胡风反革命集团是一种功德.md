    Exposing the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique is a Meritorious Deed
    Jùzàn
    I have always worked in Buddhist circles and have never read Hu Feng's works. Regarding the articles exposing Hu Feng's reactionary ideology, I initially thought they were only matters for the literary and art circles and had nothing to do with my work, so I paid no attention. After reading the first batch of materials published in the "People's Daily" on May 13th, I initially thought it was just a retaliatory mentality after Hu Feng's ambition to dominate the literary world before liberation was thwarted, and not necessarily a real counter-revolutionary. The publication of the second batch of materials immediately brightened my eyes, and I felt that Hu Feng was insidious and vicious, resolutely opposed to the people, and had a large group of followers and a strict organization. He was indeed a counter-revolutionary. After reading the third batch of materials, I further learned that the Hu Feng clique was inextricably linked to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents. All their ideas resonated with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, the overthrown feudal landlords, and the imperialists, and all their activities also represented the interests of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, the overthrown feudal landlords, and the imperialists. Even if we build the new China into the "Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss" as described in Buddhism, they would still harbor hatred and try every possible means to attack and destroy it.
    Revolution and counter-revolution have always been irreconcilable, and the overthrown class enemies are never reconciled to their defeat. At present, there may still be room for their activities. This exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's criminal activities, on the one hand, can enable everyone to further recognize the vicious intentions of counter-revolutionaries and raise revolutionary vigilance, and on the other hand, it can also awaken those wavering and backward people with liberal ideas, so that they can rein in at the brink of the precipice and be saved. Therefore, I very much agree with the view that exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is another serious struggle against the enemy.
    Furthermore, as far as our Buddhist circles are concerned, we have had very little contact with the literary and art circles, and not many people know Hu Feng. However, the liberal ideas of our Buddhist believers are very strong. This time, after reading the three batches of materials published in the "People's Daily," everyone received a profound education. In addition to unanimously agreeing with the resolutions of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on expelling Hu Feng from the Chinese Writers Association, requesting the removal of Hu Feng's qualifications as a representative of the National People's Congress, and suggesting that the government investigate and deal with him according to law, we also put forward specific opinions on strengthening patriotic education and further distinguishing between friends and enemies. From this point of view alone, it is very reasonable to regard the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique as a meritorious deed beneficial to all the people.

    揭露胡风反革命集团是一种功德
    巨赞
    我一向在佛教界工作，从来没有看过胡风的著作，对于揭露胡风反动思想的文章，开始也认为只是文艺界方面的事情，同自己业务无关，毫不注意。看了五月十三日“人民日报”上发表的第一批材料，当时还以为是解放之前胡风想独霸文坛的野心受了打击以后的一种报复心理，未必就是真正的反革命分子。第二批材料的发表，顿使我的眼睛明亮起来，觉得胡风此人阴险恶毒，坚决与人民为敌，而且党羽成群，组织严密，的确是反革命分子。看了第三批材料，进一步地知道了，原来胡风集团是和蒋匪特务有着千丝万缕的勾结的。他们的一切想法都是和蒋匪帮、被打倒的封建地主以及帝国主义一鼻孔出气的，他们的一切活动也是代表蒋匪帮、被打倒的封建地主以及帝国主义的利益的。我们即使把新中国建设成为佛教所说的“人间极乐世界”，他们还是会心怀仇恨，要千方百计设法攻击和破坏的。
    革命和反革命从来是势不两立的，被打倒的阶级敌人决不甘心于他们的失败。在目前，可能还有他们活动的余地。此次把胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动揭露了出来，一方面可以使大家进一步认识反革命分子的恶毒心肠，提高革命警惕性，另一方面也可以惊醒那许多有自由主义思想的彷徨落后的人，使他们悬崖勒马，得到拯救。所以我很同意有人认为揭露胡风反革命集团是我们对敌人的又一次严重的斗争的说法。
    再就我们佛教界来说，同文艺界历来很少接触，知道胡风的人也不多，但是，我们佛教信徒们的自由主义思想是非常浓厚的。此次我们佛教界人士阅读了“人民日报”上发表的三批材料，大家得到了深刻的教育，除了一致同意中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团关于开除胡风中国作家协会会籍、要求撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格及建议政府依法给以究办的决议外，并提出了加强爱国主义学习，进一步分清敌友的具体意见。单就这一点看，把揭露胡风反革命集团的事情，当作是对于全体人民有利益的一种功德，也是非常有理由的。
