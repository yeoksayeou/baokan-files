This newspaper dispatch from Jinan on the 16th reports: Public security organs in Jinan, Qingdao, and other areas of Shandong Province have recently arrested a group of hooligans, bandits, and other criminal elements who seriously endanger socialist construction and the safety of the people's lives and property, in accordance with the law. Among these criminals are habitual thieves with serious crimes. For example, the bandit Zhang Junlu used to constantly roam around Zibo, Zouping, Qidong, Yucheng and other places to commit theft. In 1953, he stole ten watches from a private watch shop in Yucheng in one instance. Later, he sneaked into Jinan City and gathered more than ten habitual thieves, including ironware merchant Xing Xianjin and Nie Ketian, to form a theft gang, and carried out large-scale theft activities in the Baima Mountain area. Within three months, they stole more than 2,800 jin of pig iron from the Jinan Hardware Company. Another example is Li Jinzhang, a receiver of stolen goods who disguised himself as a scrap peddler. Qingdao's public security organs arrested him according to the law. He organized and harbored four habitual thieves to steal on a large scale. At the same time, he also used various despicable and shameless means to lure and instigate more than ten children to engage in theft. Among these criminals are swindlers who specialize in abducting and deceiving. For example, the swindler Li Jingchen, captured in Zibo City, served in the Jiang bandit army for several years in the past and consistently blackmailed and beat the masses. After liberation, he used the pretext of pretending to be possessed by gods and ghosts to treat illnesses, defrauding the masses everywhere. In Wotuo Village, he defrauded more than 70 yuan from the masses in one instance. It has been verified that the criminal Li has caused the deaths of three people by pretending to be a god and causing trouble. The abductors Kong Fanxin, Yu Jian, and Li Zhihua, captured in Jinan, often impersonated military and government personnel and defrauded money in Tianjin, Jinan, Dezhou, Yidu and other places. The incorrigible swindler Meng Xianhe in Jinan even used lime powder to manufacture "DDT powder" pesticide, posing as a cooperative employee to sell it in various places, directly harming agricultural production. Among these criminals, there are also hooligans and scoundrels who consistently disrupt public order, insult women, and corrupt morality. These criminal offenders will be punished by the people's court according to law.

    本报济南十六日电　山东省济南、青岛等地公安机关，近日来依法逮捕了一批严重危害社会主义建设和人民生命财产安全的流氓、盗匪等刑事犯罪分子。这批罪犯中，有罪恶重大的惯盗惯窃分子。如盗匪张均禄过去不断流窜于淄博、邹平、齐东、禹城等地进行盗窃活动，一九五三年在禹城一次就盗窃私营表店手表十只；后又潜入济南市，纠集惯窃铁器商人邢宪金、聂克田等十多人组成盗窃集团，在白马山一带大肆进行盗窃活动，三个月内即盗窃济南市五金公司生铁二千八百多斤。又如青岛公安机关依法逮捕的以卖破烂为掩护的销赃犯李金章，组织和豢养了四名惯窃分子大肆偷盗，同时，还以各种卑鄙无耻的手段引诱教唆十多名儿童进行盗窃活动。这批罪犯中，有专以拐骗为生的骗子手。如淄博市捕获的骗子手李敬臣，过去曾当蒋贼军数年，一贯敲诈打骂群众；解放后又借装神弄鬼治病为名，到处坑害群众，在窝陀村一次就向群众骗去七十余元。据查实，李犯曾闹神闹鬼治死三个人。济南捕获的拐骗犯孔繁信、于见、李志华等，经常冒充军政人员，在天津、济南、德州、益都等地骗取钱财。屡教不改的骗子手孟宪和在济南竟以石灰粉制造“滴滴涕粉”农药，假充合作社职员到各地出卖，直接损害了农业生产。这批罪犯中，还有一贯捣乱公共秩序、侮辱妇女、败坏道德的流氓恶棍。这批刑事罪犯将由人民法院依法惩处。
