Observer's Commentary:

The Soviet tanker "Tuapse" has been held captive in Taiwan for a year now, ever since it was seized by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique at the instigation of the United States in the sea south of Taiwan on June 23 last year. Although the Soviet government has protested to the U.S. government several times, the tanker and its crew are still detained in Taiwan today. On June 18, the Soviet government once again sent a note to the U.S. government, demanding that the U.S. government immediately take measures to release the "Tuapse" tanker and its crew.

The U.S. government has been trying to deny its responsibility for this act of piracy. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on June 20, after the Soviet Union presented its note, the U.S. State Department once again denied any involvement in the "Tuapse" tanker seizure. However, the well-known fact is that this Soviet tanker was detained in waters completely under the control of the U.S. Navy, and American newspaper columnist Drew Pearson also admitted that before the "Tuapse" tanker was detained, a U.S. Navy seaplane circled over it for a long time, indicating the location of the Soviet tanker to the Chiang Kai-shek pirate ships that were carrying out the interception mission. Therefore, the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for the "Tuapse" tanker seizure, which cannot be denied.

The U.S. government has not only failed to take any measures to release the "Tuapse" tanker and its crew, but, according to information obtained by the crew of the Polish merchant ship "President Gottwald," the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek elements are also subjecting these crew members to violent persecution and mockery, trying to prevent them from returning to their homeland. The U.S. government is also planning to use the granting of "political asylum" as a smokescreen, wanting to kidnap them to the United States. The use of violence and threats against the crew members of the hijacked "Tuapse" tanker is a serious destruction of human rights and freedom and a blatant violation of international law.

It must be pointed out here that the so-called U.S. offer of "political asylum" to the "Tuapse" tanker crew is not only a slander against the Soviet crew members and an attempt to cover up U.S. crimes, but also an attempt to use these Soviet citizens as tools for the United States to wage the Cold War, in order to further worsen the international atmosphere and exacerbate the tension.

Currently, the Soviet Union, China, and peace-loving people all over the world are making efforts to increase trust between countries and ease international tensions. The United States also says on the surface that it hopes to ease international tensions and wants peace. However, the "Tuapse" tanker is still detained, the Soviet crew members are still being persecuted, and the United States is using this hijacking incident to create a Cold War. With the support of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique continues to obstruct the freedom of navigation on the high seas and undermine the safety of international shipping. According to the Associated Press, on June 21, the Chiang bandit clique intercepted two British merchant ships off the coast of mainland China. All upright people around the world are indignant at the hypocrisy of the United States and its instigation of the Chiang bandit clique to continue its acts of piracy in the Taiwan Strait. People cannot tolerate this behavior of the United States that obstructs the easing of international tensions. The U.S. government should prove its words with action. Empty talk of peace and refusal to act cannot deceive anyone.

### 美国逃不了对苏联油船事件的责任

    美国逃不了对苏联油船事件的责任
    苏联“图阿普斯号”船油自从去年六月二十三日在台湾以南海面上被美国指使蒋介石卖国集团劫夺之后，到现在已经一年了。虽然苏联政府几次向美国政府提出抗议，然而直到如今，这只油船和它的船员仍被扣留在台湾。六月十八日，苏联政府再一次向美国政府提出照会，要求美国政府立即采取措施，使“图阿普斯号”油船和它的船员获释。
    美国政府一直企图抵赖对这次海盗行为应负的责任。据路透社华盛顿六月二十日电讯报道，在这次苏联提出照会后，美国国务院又一次进行抵赖，把“图阿普斯号”油船被劫事件说成与自己无关。然而大家都知道的事实是：这只苏联油船是在完全处于美国海军的控制下的海面上被扣留的，而且美国报纸专栏作家德鲁·皮尔逊也承认，在“图阿普斯号”油船被扣留以前，曾经有一架美国海军水上飞机在它的上空盘旋了好久，向执行拦劫任务的蒋介石海盗舰只指示这艘苏联油船的方位。因此，美国政府对“图阿普斯号”油船被劫事件必须负全部责任，这是抵赖不了的。
    美国政府不仅至今没有采取任何措施，以使“图阿普斯号”油船和它的船员获释，而且据波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德总统号”船员得到的情报说，美国和蒋介石分子还对这些船员进行暴力的迫害和嘲弄，竭力企图阻止他们返回自己的祖国。美国政府还在策划以给予他们“政治避难”作为烟幕，想把他们劫到美国去。对于被劫的“图阿普斯号”油船船员施加暴力和威胁，是对人权和自由的严重的摧毁，是对国际法的粗暴的破坏。
    这里必须指出：所谓美国将给予“图阿普斯号”油船船员以“政治避难”的说法，不仅是对苏联船员的诬蔑，不仅是企图以此来掩盖美国的罪行，而且是企图把这些苏联公民用作美国进行冷战的工具，以便进一步恶化国际气氛，加剧局势的紧张。
    目前，苏联、中国和全世界爱好和平的人民都正在为增加各国间的信任、缓和国际局势而进行努力。美国表面上也说是希望缓和国际局势，愿意和平。然而“图阿普斯号”油船仍被扣留、苏联船员仍遭迫害，美国并利用这次劫夺事件制造冷战。在美国的支持下，蒋介石卖国集团还在继续阻挠公海航行自由，破坏国际航运安全。据美联社报道，六月二十一日，蒋贼集团又在中国大陆沿海阻截两只英国商船。全世界一切正直的人民，对美国的口是心非和指使蒋贼集团在台湾海面继续进行的海盗行为表示愤慨。人们不能容忍美国这种阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和的行为。美国政府应该拿行动来证明它自己的语言。空谈和平拒绝行动是骗不了人的。
