Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 8th. Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, upon returning to Jakarta airport on the 7th after his invited visit to China, made a statement to reporters.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said: I would like to express my satisfaction with my visit to the People's Republic of China. First, my visit should be seen as in line with the spirit of the Bandung Conference and the official declarations made during the conference, especially in line with the spirit of mutual understanding and common concerns reached between Indonesia and China. In the areas of our common concern, there is a wealth of efforts to ease world tensions, especially in Asia, to promote good neighborly relations, and to promote trade and cultural relations based on the principle of mutual benefit.

In this regard, I exchanged views with the senior leaders of the People's Republic of China, especially with Premier Zhou Enlai. As a result of the exchange of views, we have reached a common understanding of the assistance we can provide in implementing the results of the Asian-African Conference.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo continued: "In addition, Indonesia's willingness to help explore the possibility of negotiations between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America was also a project discussed between Premier Zhou Enlai and me. This proposal, put forward by Indonesia in coordination with the efforts of other friendly countries, was well received."

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said: A common understanding has been reached in efforts to promote trade between Indonesia and China. Mutual understanding has also been reached on the solution to the issue of dual nationality. Therefore, it is expected that the implementation of the treaty between China and Indonesia on the issue of dual nationality will proceed smoothly.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said: The impression I gained from visiting China's economic, social and cultural reconstruction work was very satisfactory. I was able to appreciate the spirit of New China and its people in building the country with the aim of improving people's living standards. This is reflected in their hard work. I could feel the surging enthusiasm of the Chinese people for peace, which is especially evident among young people. They desire peace in order to build their country.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo concluded by saying that he was very grateful to the Chinese people and their leaders for their gracious hospitality to himself and everyone in our party during our visit to China, and for the attitude that clearly demonstrated friendly feelings towards Indonesia and its people. My visit to the People's Republic of China has produced good results and will help to continue to maintain peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries on a broader foundation based on the principles of mutual benefit and non-interference.

    新华社雅加达八日电　印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约在应邀访问中国以后，在七日回国到达雅加达飞机场时向新闻记者发表了谈话。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理说：我愿意对我在中华人民共和国的访问表示满意。首先，我的访问应该被认为是符合万隆会议和会议期间所发表的正式宣言的精神的，特别是符合印度尼西亚和中国两国所达成的互相谅解和共同关心的精神的。在我们所共同关心的领域中，充满了缓和世界紧张局势，特别是亚洲的紧张局势，促进睦邻关系和根据互利的原则促进贸易和文化关系等努力。
    关于这方面，我同中华人民共和国的高级领袖们，特别是同周恩来总理交换了意见。由于交换意见，我们已经就我们在执行亚非会议的结果方面所能给予的帮助取得了共同的谅解。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理接着说：“此外，印度尼西亚表示愿意进行帮助来探讨中华人民共和国同美利坚合众国进行谈判的可能性的建议，也是周恩来总理同我讨论的一个项目。印度尼西亚配合其他友邦的努力所提出的这个建议得到了良好的对待。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理说：在努力促进印度尼西亚和中国之间的贸易方面取得了共同谅解。在双重国籍问题的解决办法方面也已经得到了相互的谅解。因此，可以预料，中国和印度尼西亚关于双重国籍问题的条约的执行将会顺利进行。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理说：我在参观中国在经济、社会和文化各方面的复兴工作时获得的印象是非常令人满意的。我能够体会到新中国和它的人民以提高人民生活水平为目的来建设国家的那种精神。这从他们辛勤努力的工作中表现出来。我能够感觉到中国人民要求和平的奔腾的热情，这种热情在青年中特别显著。他们热望和平是为了要建设他们的国家。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理最后说，我非常感谢中国人民和他们的领袖在我们访问中国时对于我自己和我们一行每一个人的殷勤招待，以及那种明显表现对于印度尼西亚和它的人民的友好的感情的态度。我对中华人民共和国的访问已经产生了良好的结果，并且有助于继续维持两国在互利和互不干涉的原则上奠定的具有更广泛的基础的和平友好关系。
