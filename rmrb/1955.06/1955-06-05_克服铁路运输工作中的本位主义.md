Overcoming Departmentalism in Railway Transportation Work
　　Jian Xin

The railway is a major artery connecting our country economically, politically, militarily, and culturally into a whole. In order to ensure the smooth and uninterrupted operation of railway transportation, its various links need a high degree of coordination and the closest cooperation. Stalin once said: "Railway transportation should be a clear, precise, and accurate machine, like a good clock. The pause of any small part of the machine will more or less affect the entire railway business." "In order to realize the decisive and comprehensive role of railway transportation, it is first necessary to coordinate the various departments and to carry out work in strict order within each department." This shows that strengthening internal contact and cooperation in railways is an important guarantee for completing the national plan with good quality.

However, serious departmentalism has long existed in railway transportation work. In the past year, the Ministry of Railways received 102 telegrams from various bureaus mutually accusing each other of departmentalism, and 18 in March of this year alone. The most serious is: The management bureau or sub-bureau, in order to shorten the turnaround time of vehicles in its own bureau, launched various "struggles" around the "18 o'clock" (6 PM). The vehicle turnaround time of the railway is calculated by dividing the number of vehicles used in its own bureau by the number of vehicles loaded and the number of heavy vehicles received in its own bureau each day. That is to say, the larger the ratio of the number of vehicles loaded and the number of heavy vehicles received to the number of vehicles used, the shorter the turnaround time is. And the dividing line between each day and the next day is 18 o'clock - 6 PM. Therefore, many departmentalists try their best to push the vehicles to other bureaus before 18 o'clock. Sometimes they even deliberately delay passenger trains to let freight trains run ahead to "grab 18 o'clock." At the same time, before 18 o'clock, they try their best to refuse to accept vehicles from other bureaus. In this way, the number of vehicles staying within their jurisdiction is reduced, and the calculation of vehicle turnaround time naturally appears to be very "successful." However, from the perspective of the entire railway, the turnaround time of vehicles is artificially prolonged. The normal operating order is also disrupted. In February of this year, among the 138 trains handed over by the Jinzhou Bureau from Siping Station to the Harbin Bureau, 86 trains were refused to be accepted. From January to early March, 60% of the trains from Jilin to Siping were refused to be accepted and stopped outside the station. Similar examples exist in every management bureau and sub-bureau. In addition, many bureaus, in order to facilitate their own bureau to load more vehicles, detain empty vehicles that should be assigned to neighboring bureaus, so that neighboring bureaus have goods but no vehicles and cannot complete transportation tasks, resulting in transportation imbalance, or do not send empty vehicles according to the types and directions required by neighboring bureaus. On the surface, it seems that the task of sending empty vehicles has been completed, but in reality, because what is sent is not what is used, it often causes empty vehicles to travel.

The departmentalism among various business departments of the railway is also very serious. The car department, in order to complete its own unit's indicators, often asks for too many locomotives or calls locomotives out of the depot too early, causing waste of locomotives. Sometimes locomotives often wait at the station for several hours, or even a whole day, with nothing to do. The locomotive department tries to give as few locomotives as possible to the car department, and even intentionally makes tight or reverse turnarounds on the operating diagram in order to increase the daily vehicle kilometers of its own unit. As a result, the locomotives cannot arrive on time, prolonging the vehicle stay time and causing late departures.

There is also a lack of coordination between the station and the vehicle depot. Changchun Station, in order to marshall direct trains and shorten the marshalling time, disregards the quality of the vehicles and the possibility of accidents. Vehicles that should be repaired are not sent to the vehicle depot for repair on time. Changchun Vehicle Depot often attaches a shunting repair mark to vehicles that should not be shunted for repair in order to complete the repair task. Fengtai Station requires car inspectors to inspect cars quickly to ensure punctuality, but the head of the vehicle depot says: "I don't care about your punctuality, I guarantee the quality." Therefore, when the car inspectors are rewarded at the station for ensuring punctuality, they are also criticized by the head of the vehicle depot.

Even within the same unit, there is departmentalism among the various shifts. After the dispatcher comes to work, he generally marshals the cars that are easy to marshal first, and leaves the cars that are not easy to marshal to the next shift. When it is close to getting off work, some cars that should be marshalled are not marshalled, making the lines very chaotic. This creates difficulties for the work of the next shift.

Departmentalism in railway transportation is currently a common phenomenon. It is the root cause of the waste of locomotives and vehicles, transportation imbalance, and chaotic transportation order.

Why is there such serious departmentalism?

Many comrades have short-sightedness, only seeing partial interests, not seeing overall interests, only seeing their own part of the work, not seeing the inseparable relationship of the entire organization. These comrades often say: Our starting point is still to do the work of our unit well. However, the purpose of doing the work of our unit well is to do the entire railway transportation work well and meet the requirements of the country and the people. The departmentalists are "doing well" the work of their own unit on the basis of hindering the work of other units and even destroying the overall transportation work. If we allow this departmentalism to exist, then there will be no overall interests.

Even worse, some comrades do not work hard to improve their work, but use the method of blaming others to complete their own unit's plans and technical and economic indicators, or use concealment, falsification, and other deceptive means to obtain achievements. For example, on February 14, the 2405 train at Changchun Station had not yet been marshalled, but falsely reported that it would "depart immediately" and completed the block procedure at 1:18 PM ahead of schedule, causing the 1906 train from Jilin to wait in vain for 1 hour and 10 minutes. The correctness of the forecasts between Tianjin and Fengtai and between Tianjin and Guye is only 20% to 30%. Some dispatchers said: "The forecast is a nonsense, telling lies while looking at the roof." If this practice of harming others to benefit oneself is not eradicated, the transportation order of the railway will not be normal, and the transportation efficiency of the railway will not be improved.

The reason why departmentalism has long existed on the railway is also because many leaders have adopted a tolerant and conciliatory attitude towards the phenomenon of departmentalism, and even they themselves have departmentalist ideas. Some responsible comrades of departments lack the spirit of self-criticism. Not only can they not set an example, but they first complain to other departments and shirk responsibility at the daily transportation work report meeting, which promotes the development of departmentalism. Many leaders of railway management bureaus and transportation sub-bureaus not only do not stop the departmentalism of dispatchers, but believe that this dispatcher is "capable" and "has two sets of skills." Some dispatchers even pride themselves on being "fighters for completing tasks" and openly violate overall interests. Many leaders adopt an attitude of ignoring and disregarding the opinions of neighboring bureaus and superiors. The Ministry of Railways successively ordered the Harbin Railway Administration on February 14, March 1, and March 23 to investigate the responsibility of Changchun, Xin Songpu Port, and Siping stations for violating discipline and damaging overall interests, but has not received a reply for a long time. Departmentalism among leaders and the conciliatory attitude towards lower-level departmentalism is an important reason why the phenomenon of departmentalism on the railway has not only not decreased and disappeared, but is instead increasing.

In order to overcome departmentalism in railway transportation work, we must first start with leaders at all levels, establish the idea of "all work is to complete the transportation task" among leaders, and educate all railway employees with this; at the same time, combined with practical work, with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, we must carry out extensive and in-depth criticism of all departmentalist ideas, form an atmosphere in which everyone opposes departmentalism, and make departmentalism something that everyone abandons. Only when all railway employees, especially leaders, overcome departmentalist ideas and clarify that the work of all departments on the railway is to complete the transportation task, can we improve the level of transportation work and complete more transportation tasks with the same equipment.

### 克服铁路运输工作中的本位主义

    克服铁路运输工作中的本位主义
    剑新
    铁路是我们国家从经济上、政治上、军事上、文化上联结成为一个整体的大动脉。为了保证顺利地不间断地进行铁路运输，就需要它的各个环节有高度的协调和最密切的配合。斯大林曾经说过：“铁路运输应该是一种工作明晰、动作正确，犹如良好钟表那样准确的联动机。联动机上任何一个微小部门的停顿，或多或少都会影响到铁路的全部业务。”“为了实现有决定意义的全面的铁路运输作用，首先要求各部的协调一致，并要求各部内按严格的规定次序进行工作。”这说明，加强铁路内部的联系协作是质量良好地完成国家计划的重要保证。
    然而，在铁路运输工作中，长期存在着严重的本位主义。去年一年内，铁道部收到各局互相控告本位主义的电报有一百零二件，今年三月份一个月就收到十八件。其中最严重的是：管理局或分局为了缩短本局车辆周转时间，围绕“十八点”所展开的形形色色的“斗争”。铁路的车辆运转时间是以每天自己局管内的装车数和接运重车数去除在自己局管内运用着的车数。也就是说装车数和接运重车数占运用车的比数越大，周转时间就越短越好。而每一天和下一天的分界线是以十八点——下午六点为准。于是，许多本位主义者每到十八点以前，就尽可能把车辆推到外局去。有时竟故意叫客车晚点，先让货车跑到前面去“抢十八点”。同时，在十八点以前，又尽可能拒绝接入外局的车。这样，自己所辖范围内停留的车辆就少了，计算车辆周转时间时，自然就显得很有“成绩”。但是，从整个铁路看来，车辆的运转时间却被人为地拉长了。正常的运行秩序也被打乱。今年二月，锦州局由四平车站交给哈尔滨局的一百三十八趟列车中，有八十六趟列车遭到拒不接车。而一月到三月上旬吉林到四平的列车又有百分之六十被拒绝接车，停在站外。类似的例子在每个管理局和分局都有。除此以外，还有不少局为了便利自己局多装车，把应该排给邻局的空车扣留下来，使得邻局有货无车，不能完成运输任务，造成运输不平衡或者是不按照邻局所需要的车种和方向排送空车，表面上好像完成了排送空车的任务，但实际上由于所排非所用，常常造成空车旅行。
   铁路各个业务部门之间的本位主义也是很严重的。车务部门为了完成本单位的指标，常常过多地要机车，或过早地叫机车出库，造成机车的浪费，有时机车常常在站上等候几个小时，甚至一整天没有事做。机务部门对车务部门就尽量少给机车，甚至为了提高本单位的日车公里，有意在运行图上做紧交路或反交路，结果机车不能按时赶到，延长车辆停留时间，造成出发晚点。
    车站和车辆段之间也存在不协调的现象。长春车站为了编组直达列车，缩短编组时间，竟不顾车辆质量情况，不顾可能引起事故，应该检修的车辆也不按时送到车辆段去检修，长春车辆段为了完成修车任务，常常把不应该甩修的车也插上甩修标志。丰台车站要求检车员快快检车，以保证正点，而车辆段段长却说：“我不管你正点不正点，我是保证质量的。”因而，检车员在车站是保证了正点而得奖时，同时却受到车辆段段长的批评。
    甚至在同一个单位，各班也存在本位主义。调度员上班后，一般是先把好编的车编了，把不好编的车留给下一班，到了接近下班的时候，有些该编的车也不编了，线路弄得很乱。给下一班的工作造成困
  难。
    铁路运输中的本位主义在目前是一种普遍的现象。它是造成机车车辆浪费，运输不平衡，运输秩序混乱的根本原因。
    为什么会有这样严重的本位主义呢？
    许多同志目光短浅，只看到部分利益，看不到整体利益，只看到自己部分的工作，看不到整个组织不可分割的关系。这些同志常说：我们的出发点还是为了把本单位的工作做好。但是，把本单位工作做好的目的是为了把整个铁路运输工作做好，满足国家和人民的要求，而本位主义者是在妨碍了其他单位的工作、甚至破坏了整体运输工作的基础上把本单位工作“做好”的。如果我们允许这种本位主义存在的话，那就没有了整体利益。
    更恶劣的是，还有一些同志不努力改进工作，却以嫁祸于人的办法去完成本单位的计划和技术经济指标，或者采用隐瞒、造假等欺骗手段来骗取成绩。例如二月十四日，长春站二四○五次列车还没有编成，假报“马上就开”，提前一点十八分办理了闭塞手续，使吉林来的一九○六次列车白等了一点十分钟。天津、丰台间，天津、古冶间预报的正确性也只达百分之二十到三十。有的调度员说：
  “预报是胡报，望着屋顶说瞎话”。如果不根除这种损人利己的作风，铁路的运输秩序是不可能正常的，铁路的运输效率是不可能提高的。
   铁路上的本位主义所以长期存在，还因为许多领导人员对本位主义现象采取纵容、姑息的态度，甚至他们自己就存在本位主义思想。有些部门的负责同志缺乏自我批评的精神，不但不能以身作则，反而在每日运输工作汇报会议上首先同别的部门互相埋怨，推卸责任，助长了本位主义的发展。很多铁路管理局和运输分局的领导人员不但不制止调度人员的本位主义，反而认为这个调度员“能干”“有两套”，有的调度员竟常以“完成任务的斗士”自负，并明目张胆地违反整体利益。很多领导人员对邻局的意见和上级的意见采取置之不理和不了了之的态度。铁道部二月十四日、三月一日、三月二十三日先后命令哈尔滨铁路管理局追查长春、新松浦口和四平站违反纪律、损害整体利益的责任，长期没有得到答复。领导人员中的本位主义和对下级本位主义所采取的姑息态度，是铁路上的本位主义现象不但不能减少和绝迹，相反地还在增加的一个重要原因。
    为了克服铁路运输工作中的本位主义，首先必须从各级领导人员作起，在领导人员中树立“一切工作都是为了完成运输任务”的思想，并以此教育全体铁路员工；同时结合实际工作，以批评和自我批评的精神，对一切本位主义思想展开广泛的、深入的批判，形成人人反对本位主义的空气，使本位主义成为人所共弃的东西。只有全体铁路员工，特别是领导人员，克服了本位主义思想，明确铁路上各个部门的工作都是为了完成运输任务，才有可能提高运输工作的水平，以同样的设备完成更多的运输任务。
