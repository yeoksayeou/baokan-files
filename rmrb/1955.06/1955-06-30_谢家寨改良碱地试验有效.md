    Xie Jiazhai's Alkali Land Improvement Experiment Effective
    The barley and alfalfa planted this spring in the Xie Jiazhai alkali land flushing and improvement experimental area in Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, are growing well. According to a survey by the Provincial Soil Testing Station: The better-growing barley has an average of two to four tillers, a plant height of 70 to 80 centimeters, large ears and many grains, and it is estimated that the best yield will be about 300 jin per mu, and the average yield of the entire experimental area will be more than 100 jin per mu. The barley is about to mature; the alfalfa has grown to about 20 centimeters high and can be harvested in the seventh and eighth months.
    Shanxi Province has more than 2 million mu of saline-alkali wasteland. In order to improve these saline-alkali wastelands and expand the planting area, in 1954, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, experiments were carried out in Xie Jiazhai, Wenshui County, where the soil has a high salt-alkali content, and 164 mu were improved by flushing. This year, Shanxi Province established a long-term soil improvement experimental station in Xie Jiazhai Village, Wenshui County, to further summarize and promote the experience of improving alkali land.

    谢家寨改良碱地试验有效
    山西省文水县谢家寨碱地冲洗改良试验区，今春播种的大麦，苜蓿生长良好。据省土壤试验站调查：生长较好的大麦平均分蘖二至四株，株高达七十至八十公分，穗大粒多，估计最好的每亩约产三百斤左右，全试验区平均每亩可产一百多斤。目前大麦即将成熟；苜蓿已生长二十公分左右高，七、八月间即可开始收割一茬。
    山西省有二百多万亩盐碱荒地，为了改良这些盐碱荒地，扩大种植面积，一九五四年，根据苏联专家建议，在土质含盐碱性较重的文水县谢家寨进行试验，冲洗改良了一百六十四亩。今年山西省在文水县谢家寨村成立了长期性的土壤改良试验站，准备进一步总结和推广改良碱地的经验。
