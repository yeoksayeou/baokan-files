Strengthening Education on Conscious Discipline for Middle and Primary School Students

    The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China recently formulated and promulgated the "Student Code of Conduct for Middle and Primary Schools," which stipulates the basic standards for learning discipline and daily behavior for middle and primary school students nationwide. All middle and primary school educators, especially teachers, should strengthen education on conscious discipline among students based on these specific regulations, and strive to cultivate the communist moral character of children and young people in order to implement the comprehensive development education policy.
  In recent years, with the development of the socialist construction and socialist transformation in our great motherland, with the strengthening of socialist education for children and young people by our Party, and with the diligent efforts of all educators, the new moral character of middle and primary school students nationwide has gradually been formed. Their socialist awareness is constantly improving; learning discipline and collectivist spirit are also gradually being established. These should be affirmed, and are the main aspects. However, on the other hand, because our country is in a period of transition, the remnants of the old society have not been completely eliminated, and the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie still directly and indirectly influence and corrode children and young people in many ways; at the same time, due to the many shortcomings in our education work, some students in schools are still infected with certain bad habits, do not observe discipline, and even disrupt discipline, which seriously affects teaching work and school order. In order to eliminate these undesirable phenomena, better cultivate the moral character of children and young people, and make them talents with all-round development, we require all middle and primary school educators to conscientiously implement the "Student Code of Conduct" and truly make it a discipline that middle and primary school students consciously abide by.
    Currently, in all middle and primary schools across the country, learning discipline must first be established emphatically. The central task of the school is teaching, and the central task of students is learning. In order to ensure the progress of school teaching work and the completion of students' learning tasks, normal learning discipline is indispensable. Phenomena such as students being late, leaving early, arbitrarily skipping classes, chaotic classroom order, and not paying attention to extracurricular assignments must be quickly and fundamentally changed. At the same time, in terms of students' daily behavior, they must also correctly understand the relationship between people in the new society, the relationship between the individual and the collective, and establish a new attitude towards dealing with people and things. It should be pointed out that in the education of children and young people, many school teachers still hold the erroneous attitude of "teaching books but not teaching people." This is completely inconsistent with our middle and primary school education policy and must be fundamentally reversed.
    Of course, our discipline education for students must be carried out on the basis of inspiring students' consciousness and initiative. The discipline we need is conscious discipline; our discipline education is conscious discipline education. Conscious discipline is a discipline unique to socialist society. At present, our country is advancing on the socialist road. In improving the socialist awareness of children and young people, they must consciously strengthen their sense of responsibility to the country and society, as well as their sense of responsibility for their own behavior. Therefore, the basic spirit of the "Student Code of Conduct" must be understood from a positive perspective, and students should be inspired, educated, and cultivated to consciously abide by discipline, and the "Code" should not be and should not be allowed to be used as a tool for simply managing students.
    The cultivation of students' conscious discipline is inseparable from the students' collective. Only in the collective, through the collective, and for the collective can students be effectively trained to consciously abide by discipline. Organizations such as the Communist Youth League, Young Pioneers, and student unions in schools, especially the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers, have played a certain role in political and ideological education in schools in the past. In the future, they should work harder to cultivate students' conscious discipline and influence general students through the exemplary behavior of their own Youth League members and Young Pioneers.
    Another important factor affecting students' life behavior is the students' families. Schools must closely contact students' parents and educate students together with the help of parents. Many schools have not yet universally attached importance to parental work, which should be said to be a shortcoming in school work. This shortcoming should be quickly and effectively remedied.
    The main educational method for students should be positive and front-facing, but in order to encourage students to move forward, students with significant progress should be rewarded in a timely manner to consolidate existing good behaviors; students who repeatedly fail to reform despite education should also be given appropriate punishments to promote their awareness. However, whether it is rewards or punishments, they should be based on the principle of education. Rewards are to better educate students, and punishments are also to achieve the purpose of educating students. At present, there are still two biases in general schools on this issue: one is that they dare not punish students who should be punished, and only carry out ineffective persuasion; the other is that they simply and rigidly adopt commandism and punitivism. These are all wrong.
    The cultivation of students' conscious discipline mainly relies on the guidance of teachers, and the teachers' own thoughts and behaviors have a direct impact on the students. In recent years, many outstanding teachers have emerged in middle and primary schools. Due to their earnest teaching and selfless labor, they have made considerable achievements in cultivating students' socialist thoughts and behaviors. In the future, teachers are also required to strengthen their sense of responsibility and give full play to the spirit of being fully responsible for students; at the same time, teachers are also required to study hard and constantly improve their socialist awareness, so as to be a role model for students with their exemplary behavior and quality. A very small number of teachers with bad conduct must be resolutely removed, and they must never be allowed to harm young people and children.
    It must be pointed out that the implementation of the "Student Code of Conduct" and the strengthening of conscious discipline education is a delicate and complex process. All middle and primary school educators must conduct education work for children and young people frequently and patiently based on their characteristics. Children and young people are the future of our motherland, and we must cultivate them very patiently and for a long time, just like gardeners cultivating beloved fruit trees.

### 加强对中、小学学生的自觉纪律教育

    加强对中、小学学生的自觉纪律教育
    中华人民共和国教育部最近先后制定并公布了中、小学学生守则，规定了全国中、小学学生的学习纪律和日常生活行为的基本准则。全体中、小学教育工作者，特别是教师们应当根据这些具体规定，加强对学生的自觉纪律教育，努力培养儿童和青年一代的共产主义道德品质，以贯彻实施全面发展的教育方针。
  近几年来，随着我们伟大祖国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的发展，随着我们党对儿童和青年一代社会主义教育的加强以及全体教育工作者辛勤的努力，全国中、小学学生的新的道德品质，已在逐渐地形成。他们的社会主义觉悟正在不断地提高；学习纪律和集体主义精神也在逐步地树立起来。这些都是应该肯定的，而且是主要的一面。但另一方面，由于我们国家处在过渡时期，旧社会的遗毒尚未完全消除，资产阶级的腐朽思想还在许多方面直接间接地影响和腐蚀儿童和青年一代；同时由于我们教育工作中还存在着不少的缺陷，因而在学校里就仍然有一些学生感染某些不良的习惯，不遵守纪律甚至破坏纪律，严重地影响了教学工作和学校秩序。为了消除这些不良现象，更好地培养儿童和青年的道德品质，使他们成为全面发展的人才，我们要求全体中、小学教育工作者，认真贯彻学生守则，使这个守则真正成为中、小学校学生自觉遵守的纪律。
    目前在全国所有的中、小学校里，首先要着重地建立学习纪律。学校的中心工作是教学，学生的中心任务是学习。为了保证学校教学工作的进行，保证学生学习任务的完成，没有正常的学习纪律是不行的。学生迟到、早退、任意旷课、课堂秩序混乱和不重视课外作业等现象必须迅速地从根本上加以改变。同时，在学生日常生活行为方面，还必须使他们正确地了解新社会人和人之间的关系、个人和集体之间的关系，树立新的待人接物的态度。应当指出：在对儿童和青年一代的教育工作中，有不少学校的教员还抱着“教书不教人”的错误态度。这是和我们中、小学的教育方针完全不符合的，必须从根本上扭转过来。
    当然，我们对学生的纪律教育是要在启发学生的自觉性和积极性的基础上来进行的。我们所需要的纪律是自觉的纪律；我们的纪律教育是自觉的纪律教育。自觉纪律是社会主义社会所特有的纪律。目前我们的国家正在社会主义道路上前进。在提高儿童和青年一代的社会主义觉悟中，必须使他们自觉地加强对国家和社会的责任感，以及对自己行为的责任感。因此，必须从积极的意义上来理解学生守则的基本精神，启发、教育、培养学生自觉地遵守纪律的习惯，而不应该也不容许把守则当做是单纯地管理学生的工具。
    学生自觉纪律的培养是离不开学生的集体的。只有在集体中，通过集体，并为了集体，才能有效地养成学生自觉地遵守纪律的习惯。学校中的青年团、少先队、学生会等组织，特别是青年团和少先队，过去在学校政治思想教育工作中，曾经起过一定的作用，今后更应当努力培养学生的自觉纪律，通过青年团员和少先队员自己的模范行为来影响一般学生。
    影响学生生活行为的另一个重要因素是学生的家庭。学校必须密切地联系学生的家长，在取得家长的帮助下，共同来教育学生。许多学校对家长工作还没有普遍地重视起来，这应该说是学校工作中的一个缺陷。这个缺陷应该迅速有效地把它弥补起来。
    对于学生的教育主要的应该采取积极正面的教育方法，但为了鼓舞学生前进，对于有显著进步的学生，应该及时给予奖励，以巩固已有的优良行为；对于屡教不改的学生，也应给以应有的处罚，以促其觉悟。不过不论奖励或处罚，都应从教育的原则出发，奖励是为了更好地教育学生，处罚也是为了达到教育学生的目的。目前一般学校在这个问题上还存在着两种偏向：一种是不敢处罚应受处罚的学生，而一味地进行无效的劝说；另一种是简单生硬地采取命令主义和惩办主义的做法。这些都是不对的。
    学生自觉纪律的培养，主要是依靠于教师的教导，而教师本身的思想行为，对学生又有直接的感染作用。几年来，在中、小学校中已经出现了不少的优秀教师，由于他们的谆谆教导和忘我的劳动，在培养学生社会主义的思想行为方面，已经做出了相当卓越的成绩。今后还要求教师们加强自身的责任感，发挥对学生全面负责的精神；同时也要求教师们努力学习，不断地提高社会主义觉悟，以自己的模范行为和品质，做学生的表率。对于极少数品行恶劣的教师必须坚决地把他们清除出外，决不能容许他们贻害青年和儿童。
    必须指出，贯彻学生守则和加强自觉纪律教育是一个细致而又复杂的过程，全体中、小学教育工作者必须经常地、耐心地根据儿童和青年的特点，对他们进行教育工作。儿童和青年一代是我们祖国的未来，我们必须非常耐心地长期地去培养他们，就像园丁栽培心爱的果木一样。
