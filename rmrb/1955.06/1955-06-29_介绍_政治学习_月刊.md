Introducing the "Political Study" Monthly
    Ma Lin

    "Political Study" Monthly is a publication designed to help readers study the Party's general line during the transition period, various policies for the socialist transformation of agriculture, and basic knowledge of communism and the Communist Party. The target audience of this publication is county and district-level workers, but it also caters to other readers of similar levels and township workers.

    Rural work during the transition period is extremely important and complex. Because building socialism requires a solid worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, and the corresponding development of agriculture and the gradual realization of socialist transformation of agriculture. Leading millions of scattered individual small-scale farmers is an extremely complex matter, which means that all of the Party's policies in rural areas must be implemented through arduous efforts. This also requires rural workers to be good at understanding and implementing the Party's policies. Experience has shown that if rural workers grasp the policies well, all rural work tasks can be smoothly achieved; otherwise, problems will arise in the work, and even serious errors may occur. Therefore, it is very necessary to publish such a publication to guide policy learning for county and district-level workers. This publication has also been welcomed by the majority of readers. Readers believe that this publication is relatively easy to understand, explains the principles thoroughly, and is very helpful to them.

    To date, six issues of "Political Study" Monthly have been published. Each issue can publish articles around the current central work or main learning tasks, systematically explaining the Party's policies and illustrating the essence of the Party's policies. For example, the first issue focused on the state's policy of unified purchase and sale and the problem of "supply exceeding demand" for certain commodities, and the fourth issue focused on the policy of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain. From the relationship between socialism and small-scale peasant economy, the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the grain market, the necessity of the state's control of the market, the current situation of social production and consumption, and the achievements and shortcomings of implementing unified purchase and sale, the spiritual essence of the unified purchase and sale policy was explained in many aspects. The second and third issues, focusing on the promotion of the worker-peasant alliance and the rectification and consolidation of agricultural producers' cooperatives, respectively, can educate readers on policies and help rural workers implement the Party's policies in their work. The issue of rural mutual aid and cooperation is also covered in each issue.

    Some articles in "Political Study" can also combine problems existing in actual work and raise them to theoretical principles for resolution. This is relatively helpful to readers. For example, the article "How to Understand the Rectification and Consolidation of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives" published in the third issue starts from the basic principle that the agricultural producers' cooperative movement is a revolutionary movement to change rural relations of production, explaining to readers the arduousness and complexity of the collectivization movement, the importance of regularly rectifying and consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives, and criticizing the tendency to only pay attention to the development of new cooperatives while ignoring the consolidation and improvement of cooperatives. Readers believe that this article solves problems and helps some workers overcome erroneous ideas. Another example is the article "Conscientiously Study Policies, Correctly Implement Policies, and Encourage Peasants to Actively Increase Production" published in the fourth issue, which is also a popular article. This article points out that the fundamental principle of the Party's work in rural areas is to be good at grasping the appropriate links that combine the individual interests of peasants with the collective interests and long-term interests, and to adopt persuasion and demonstration, rather than coercive orders, to gradually guide peasants onto the socialist road. The article convincingly tells readers why the "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" policy adheres to the socialist collective interests and is also an appropriate policy that takes into account the individual and immediate interests of peasants based on the experience of the unified purchase and sale work in the past two years, and is the gradual trend towards institutionalization of grain market management. This powerfully criticized the misunderstandings of some workers about the unified purchase and sale policy and the incorrect practices of not taking into account the actual economic situation in the unified purchase and sale work.

    In the six published issues, systematic propaganda has been carried out around the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee and the resolutions of the Party's National Congress. Articles on this aspect explain the importance of consolidating the Party's unity and solidarity, strengthening the Marxist-Leninist ideological education of Party members, strengthening the Party organization's supervision of Party members, purifying the Party organization, and ensuring the correct implementation of the Party's line and policies; pointing out the great significance of the Party's victory in the struggle against the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance. At the same time, combined with the actual situation, it focuses on explaining the Party's principle of collective leadership and the fact that Communist Party members must strive to avoid arrogance and boastfulness. These articles are helpful for county and district-level Party organizations to improve the level of Party work and improve the political and ideological level of Communist Party members. In addition, according to readers, the three columns "Knowledge of the Party," "Ideological Musings," and "Study Guidance" are more helpful to readers and have had a better impact on strengthening the combat role of rural Party organizations.

    "Political Study" also pays attention to combining current major political events to carry out propaganda to readers. For example, the third issue published an article on criticizing Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts, and the sixth issue published an article on crushing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. This major struggle against bourgeois ideology and eliminating hidden counter-revolutionaries should be of concern to county and district-level workers. In addition, this publication also carried out propaganda about the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan, and also introduced readers to scientific knowledge of atomic energy. Combined with the ideological situation of county and district-level workers, the publication also published articles against underestimating women and underestimating commercial work. In order to help readers learn from the Soviet Union's experience in building socialism, the article "How the Soviet Union Built a Socialist Society" has been serialized since the fourth issue.

    From the current point of view, "Political Study" Monthly is a publication welcomed by readers. However, judging from the published issues, the publication must continue to work hard in all aspects to further improve the quality of the publication and improve the combat effectiveness of the publication.

    The significant shortcoming of the publication is that the editorial department does not have enough understanding of the actual work situation, and the editorial work is not more closely integrated with reality, which makes it difficult for the publication to have higher combat effectiveness and ideological content. This is reflected in some of the published articles, which do not address the ideological trends of workers and the masses in actual life to effectively and specifically solve readers' ideological problems. Some articles have also been severely criticized by readers as "shooting at random," because the ideas that the article author assumes to criticize are actually not the main, large-scale, or even non-existent ones.

    Many articles are not popular and concise enough, which is also a significant shortcoming. There are too many long articles with more than four or five thousand words, and even "Ideological Musings," which should have been short and concise, often reach two or three thousand words or more. Some articles have not overcome the shortcoming of explaining concepts with concepts, making it difficult for readers to get a clear impression and understanding. Some nouns and concepts are still very general, making it difficult for even higher-level readers to understand. Some articles unnecessarily use complex sentences where short sentences can be used to make things clear. Therefore, the publication must start from the understanding ability of the target audience and achieve further popularization.

    There are also a few articles that are not correct and appropriate in content. For example, one article said: "The expenditure of the national budget is paid to workers in the form of wages, or to farmers in the form of purchasing agricultural products." This is obviously wrong. Because a considerable part of the national budget expenditure is used as accumulation of fixed assets, and another part is used as expenditure for national defense construction and other purposes. Both of these expenditures are very necessary and very important. There are other errors in the same article. Therefore, the editorial department must also pay further attention to the scientificity and accuracy of the manuscripts.

    Finally, according to readers, the publication has not published guidance and tutoring materials to cooperate with the learning of county and district-level workers, and this opinion is also worth considering.

    "Political Study" is a very important publication, and its circulation has reached more than 600,000 copies in a short period of time, which shows that it has achieved certain results and that readers are concerned about it. The editorial department of the publication should regularly listen to readers' opinions in its work and make greater efforts to run the publication better.

    介绍“政治学习”月刊
    马林
    “政治学习”月刊，是帮助读者学习党在过渡时期的总路线，学习对农业实行社会主义改造的各种政策，以及共产主义和共产党的基本知识的刊物。这个刊物的读者对象是县区工作人员，也兼顾水平相近的其他读者和乡工作人员。
    过渡时期的农村工作极其重要和复杂。因为建设社会主义需要有巩固的以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟，需要相应地发展农业和逐步实现农业的社会主义改造。而领导千百万分散的个体小生产的农民，是一件极端复杂的事情，这就使党在农村的一切政策，都要经过艰苦的努力才能贯彻。这也就要求在农村工作的工作人员善于领会和实行党的政策。经验证明，农村工作人员很好地掌握政策，农村工作的一切任务就能顺利地实现，不然，工作就会出毛病，甚至会发生严重错误。所以，出版这样一种指导县区各级工作人员学习政策的刊物，是很必要的。这个刊物也已经受到广大读者的欢迎。读者认为，这个刊物比较通俗，道理说得透彻，对他们很有帮助。
    到目前为止，“政治学习”月刊已出版了六期。每一期的刊物，都能环绕当前中心工作或主要学习任务发表文章，较有系统地讲解党的政策，说明党的政策的精神实质。比如第一期以国家的统购统销政策和某些商品的“供不应求”问题为中心，第四期以粮食的“定产、定购、定销”政策为中心，从社会主义同小农经济的关系、粮食市场上社会主义同资本主义的斗争、国家掌握市场的必要性、目前社会生产和消费的情况，以及实行统购统销的成绩和缺点等，多方面地说明了统购统销政策的精神实质。第二期和第三期，分别以宣传工农联盟、整顿和巩固农业生产合作社为中心，都能从政策上教育读者，帮助农村工作人员在工作中贯彻党的政策。至于农村的互助合作运动问题，也是每期都有文章。
    “政治学习”上有些文章还能结合实际工作中存在的问题，提高到理论原则上给以解决。这对读者的帮助是比较大的。例如，第三期发表的“怎样认识农业生产合作社的整顿巩固工作”一文，从农业生产合作运动是改变农村生产关系的革命运动这一基本原理出发，向读者说明合作化运动的艰苦性和复杂性，经常整顿和巩固农业生产合作社的重要，并且批判了只注意发展新社、忽视合作社的巩固和提高的偏向。读者认为这篇文章解决问题，使一部分工作人员克服了错误思想。又如，第四期发表的“认真学习政策，正确贯彻政策，鼓舞农民积极增产”一文，也是一篇受欢迎的文章。这篇文章指出，党在农村工作的根本原则，是针对农民的特点，善于掌握把农民个人利益和集体利益、目前利益和长远利益结合起来的恰当的环节，并采取说服和示范，而不是强迫命令的办法，逐步引导农民走上社会主义道路。文章很有说服力地告诉了读者，为什么“定产、定购、定销”政策是坚持社会主义集体利益，又是根据两年来统购统销工作的经验而制定的适当照顾农民个人利益和眼前利益的政策，是粮食市场管理工作的逐步走向制度化。这就有力地批判了一些工作人员中对统购统销政策的误解，和在统购统销工作中不照顾实际经济情况的不正确的作法。
    在已出版的六期中，都围绕着党的四中全会决议和党的全国代表会议决议，进行了系统的宣传。有关这方面的文章说明了巩固党的统一和团结，加强对党员的马克思列宁主义思想教育，加强党组织对党员的监督，纯洁党的组织，保证党的路线、政策的正确执行的重要；指出了党对于高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的斗争的胜利的重大意义。同时也结合实际情况，着重说明党的集体领导原则和共产党员必须力戒骄傲情绪和虚夸作风。这些文章，对于县区的党组织提高党的工作水平和提高共产党员的政治思想水平是有帮助的。此外，据读者反映，“党的知识”、“思想杂谈”、“学习指导”三栏，对读者的帮助较大，在加强农村党组织的战斗作用上，已起了较好的影响。
    “政治学习”也注意结合当前重大政治事件，向读者进行宣传。例如，在第三期中发表了关于批判胡适反动思想的文章，在第六期中发表了粉碎胡风反革命集团的文章，这种反对资产阶级思想和肃清暗藏的反革命分子的重大斗争，是应当引起县区工作人员的关心的。此外，这个刊物还进行了有关中国人民一定要解放台湾的宣传，还向读者介绍了原子能的科学知识。结合县区工作人员的思想情况，刊物也发表了反对轻视妇女和轻视商业工作的文章。为了帮助读者学习苏联建设社会主义的经验，从第四期起，连载了“苏联是怎样建成社会主义社会”的文章。
    从目前看来，“政治学习”月刊是受读者欢迎的一个刊物。但从已出版的各期看来，该刊还必须从各方面继续努力，进一步提高刊物的质量，提高刊物的战斗性。
    该刊显著的缺点，是编辑部对实际工作情况了解还不够，编辑工作没有更密切地结合实际，这就不容易使刊物有更高的战斗性和思想性。这反映在已发表的有些文章中，没有针对实际生活中工作人员和群众的思想动向，来切实、具体地解决读者的思想问题。有的文章，还受到读者严厉的批评，认为是“无的放矢”，因为文章作者所假设的要批判的思想，实际上不是主要的、大量存在的、甚至是不存在的。
    许多文章还不够通俗、简明，也是一个显著的缺点。四五千字以上的长文过多，甚至“思想杂谈”这样本来应当是短小精悍的文字，也往往长达二三千字以上。有些文章没有克服用概念解释概念的缺点，使读者不易得到明确的印象和理解。有些名词和概念还十分笼统，即使水平较高的读者也不易领会。有的文章，在可以用短句说清楚的地方，也不必要地使用了结构复杂的长句。因此，该刊还必须从读者对象的理解能力出发，做到更进一步的通俗化。
    也有少数文章，在内容上有不够正确、恰当的地方。例如，有一篇文章说：“国家预算的支出，不是以工资形式付给工人，就是以收购农产品的形式付给农民。”这显然是错误的。因为国家预算支出中，有相当一部分是作为固定资产的积累，还有一个部分，是作为国防建设等开支的。这两部分的支出，都是十分必要和十分重要的。同一文章中还有其他的错误。所以，编辑部也须进一步注意稿件的科学性和准确性。
    最后，据读者反映，该刊没有配合县区工作人员的学习发表指导、辅导学习的文字，这个意见也是值得考虑的。
    “政治学习”是个很重要的刊物，它的发行数量在短时期内已达到六十多万份，这说明它已有了一定的成绩，读者对它是关心的。该刊编辑部在工作中应当经常倾听读者意见，用更大的努力把刊物办得更好。
