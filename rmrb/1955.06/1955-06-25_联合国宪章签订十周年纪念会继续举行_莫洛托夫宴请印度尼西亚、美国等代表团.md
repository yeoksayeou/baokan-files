Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, dispatch from TASS, San Francisco, June 23rd: The tenth anniversary commemorative meeting of the signing of the UN Charter was held on the 22nd. Heads of various delegations continued to speak at the meeting.

　　Representatives from the Philippines, Finland, Iran, Cuba, Yemen, Yugoslavia, and Guatemala also spoke at the morning session.

　　Iranian Foreign Minister Ardalan, in his speech, noted with satisfaction that international tensions had eased somewhat in recent months. He hoped that the upcoming Four Power Summit would promote further easing of the international situation and an end to the "Cold War." Ardalan stated that he hoped all members of the United Nations, especially the major powers, should seek more ways for "reconciliation and direct contact."

　　The speech of the Cuban representative was equivalent to repeating the old fallacies of those who instigated the anti-Soviet "Cold War." The chairman of the meeting, Mr. van Kleffens, asked the Cuban representative to calm down and requested him to maintain a "more solemn tone."

　　Philippine representative Romulo advocated revising the UN Charter.

　　The head of the Yugoslav delegation, Yugoslav Foreign Secretary Popović, called on all countries to adhere to the policy of peaceful coexistence and strictly abide by the principles of the UN Charter. Popović said that countries should cooperate with each other, despite their different political and social systems. Only in this way can international tensions be eased. Regarding the issue of disarmament, he said that if further differences on this issue could be reduced in the future, it would be a contribution to improving the international situation.

　　Representatives from Sweden, Australia, Iraq, Venezuela, Thailand, Costa Rica, Luxembourg, and Paraguay spoke at the afternoon session. Most of them emphasized in their speeches the necessity of easing international tensions and realizing the principle of peaceful coexistence.

　　Swedish Foreign Minister Undén emphasized in his speech the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Undén said: Experience has shown that "the government which is the undisputed master of the entire Chinese mainland" has not been recognized as the representative of this country, "this fact makes the United Nations' activities to guarantee peace more difficult." He said, "I hope this issue will be resolved quickly." Undén said that the Soviet proposals on the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of new wars "seem to have ended the deadlock in the Disarmament Committee and made it possible to discuss" this issue effectively.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, dispatch from TASS, San Francisco, June 24th: The head of the Soviet delegation to the UN commemorative meeting, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, hosted a banquet for the American delegation on the 23rd.

　　At the banquet, opinions were exchanged on current international issues.

　　Attending the banquet were US Secretary of State Dulles, State Department Counselor Dow MacArthur, Assistant Secretary of State Merchant, and US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bohlen.

　　Attending the banquet from the Soviet delegation were Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Fedin, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Zarubin, and Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations Sobolev.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, dispatch from TASS, San Francisco, June 24th: On the 21st and 22nd, the head of the Soviet delegation to the tenth anniversary commemorative meeting of the signing of the UN Charter, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, held luncheons to host the heads of the delegations of Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, Syria, Greece, Turkey, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and the Finnish observer to the United Nations. The luncheons were held in a friendly atmosphere.

    联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会继续举行
    莫洛托夫宴请印度尼西亚、美国等代表团
    新华社二十四日讯　据塔斯社旧金山二十三日讯：联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会二十二日举行会议。各代表团团长继续在会上发言。
    苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫在上午会议上发言。（另发）
    在上午会议上还有菲律宾、芬兰、伊朗、古巴、也门、南斯拉夫和危地马拉的代表发言。
    伊朗外交大臣安迪让在发言时满意地指出，最近几个月来国际紧张局势有了某些缓和。他希望即将举行的四大国政府首脑会议能促进国际局势的进一步缓和及结束“冷战”。安迪让表示，他希望所有联合国的会员国、尤其是大国应该更多地寻求“和解和直接来往”的办法。
    古巴代表的发言等于是重复反苏“冷战”的策动人的老一套谬论。大会主席范克里芬斯要求古巴代表冷静一些，并且请他保持“比较庄重一些的语调”。
    菲律宾代表罗慕洛主张重订联合国宪章。
    南斯拉夫代表团团长、南斯拉夫外交秘书长波波维奇呼吁各国遵守和平共处的政策，严格遵循联合国宪章的原则。波波维奇说，各国应相互合作，尽管它们的政治和社会制度不同。只有这样，才能使国际紧张局势缓和。在谈到裁军问题时，他说，如果在以后能够对这个问题进一步减少分歧，那将是对改善国际局势的一个贡献。
    在下午会议上发言的有瑞典、澳大利亚、伊拉克、委内瑞拉、泰国、哥斯达黎加、卢森堡和巴拉圭的代表。他们大多数人在发言中都着重指出必须缓和国际紧张局势和实现和平共处的原则。
    瑞典外交大臣恩顿在发言中着重提到恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利问题。恩顿说：经验证明，“作为中国整个大陆的无可置辩的主人的政府”没有被承认为这一国家的代表，“这个事实使联合国保障和平的活动因而变得困难起来”。他说，“我希望这一问题将迅速获得解决”。恩顿说，苏联关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议，“看来已经结束了裁军委员会中的僵局，并且使得有可能有成效地讨论”这一问题。
