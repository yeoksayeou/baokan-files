Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, June 23rd: The World Peace Conference opened at the Messuhalli Hall in Helsinki at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. An hour before the opening of the conference, nearly two thousand representatives from ninety countries had already arrived at the spacious venue.

On the suggestion of World Peace Council Secretary-General Jean Lafitte, the conference unanimously approved the list of the 150-member presidium. This included representatives of various peace-loving forces participating in the conference, prominent leaders of the World Peace Council, initiators of the conference, leaders from scientific and cultural circles, and representatives of public organizations. Mrs. Leivo-Larsson, the Second Minister of Social Affairs of Finland, attended the conference on behalf of the Finnish government.

The chairman of the June 22nd session, Joliot-Curie, elected by the conference, announced the opening of the World Peace Conference amidst thunderous applause.

Vaino Meltti, a member of the World Peace Council, addressed the conference on behalf of Finnish peace defenders, congratulating it on its success. He said that the representatives gathered here represented more countries than ever before, which shows that the desire for peace is growing everywhere.

Next, the letters of greeting to the World Peace Conference from Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, the famous Indian social activist Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru, former Mexican President Cárdenas, and Honorary President of the French National Assembly Herriot were read. These letters of greeting were warmly applauded by the audience.

Queen Elisabeth of Belgium expressed in her letter her hope that the conference could achieve its stated goals, thereby contributing to the establishment of harmony and peace among nations.

Mrs. R. Nehru said in her letter, "The World Peace Conference is an answer to the problems facing peace-loving people of all countries. I hope that from the platform of this meeting, people of all countries will make a sacred oath to condemn war and completely avoid war for mankind."

Cárdenas advocated in his letter an organized and continuous struggle to safeguard the freedom and independence of all peoples, in order to ensure lasting world peace.

Herriot stated in his letter his willingness to oppose the danger of war and the revival of German militarism, and expressed his determination to fight tirelessly against thermonuclear war. He said: "I oppose the revival of German militarism not out of hatred for Germany; some of our former enemies are unwilling to condemn the atrocities that have caused so much suffering, but many Germans who are condemned by their conscience agree with us. Their merits are great, and all pacifists should thank them. I am happy to express this gratitude. We have not yet succeeded, but I am by no means disappointed. Whether the demons that have caused so many disasters to mankind can be eliminated depends on the will of the people of all countries. This is the purpose of your conference in Helsinki.

"We must always fight tirelessly against thermonuclear war. The conscience of the people will surely free many innocent people from the disasters that still threaten them. Dear friends, please accept my support, the support of an eighty-three-year-old man who is in his twilight years. He will implore you with all his remaining energy to unite morally, even more strongly than politically, to eliminate the despicable demons, to guarantee the right of people of all countries to live in peace, especially to protect women and children, and to realize the most beautiful words ever spoken to mankind:
 'Peace on earth, goodwill to men.'"

Subsequently, the Chairman of the World Peace Council, the famous French scientist Joliot-Curie, delivered a long speech.

In his speech, Joliot-Curie talked about the international situation and the current tasks of the peace movement. He pointed out that the world peace movement has had a tremendous impact on public opinion. Today, world public opinion has become an active force. However, public opinion must also be translated into practical action in order to further play its due role in defending peace.

Joliot-Curie pointed out that the Geneva agreements on ending the Indochina war have eased international tensions. Later, the military treaty concluded at the Manila Conference attempted to divide Asia into hostile blocs. However, another conference—the Bandung Conference of twenty-nine Asian and African countries—attracted the attention of the whole world. The Bandung Conference was an example of international consultation. The ten principles adopted by the conference are a true charter of peaceful coexistence. It has had a great impact not only on Asia and Africa but also on the entire world.

When talking about the European issue, Joliot-Curie pointed out that the ratification of the Paris Accords has become a serious obstacle on the road to easing international tensions. However, it can never stop people's will to demand peace and resolve the German issue through consultation. This will of the people is increasingly becoming a force to overcome new obstacles existing on the road to peace. He cited the example of the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty, illustrating that the vast majority of people in many countries are willing to maintain their national independence and believe that the establishment of good relations between countries with different social systems is an important factor for peace.

Joliot-Curie also talked in detail about the development of the world's people's movement demanding the banning of atomic and hydrogen weapons and demanding disarmament.

Joliot-Curie pointed out that the peace-loving people of the world demand that the four-power summit to be held in Geneva in July achieve success in resolving important international issues. In talking about the tenth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, he pointed out that the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations organization must be restored. Joliot-Curie believes that in order for the Four-Power Conference to achieve important results, a Five-Power Conference must be convened following it.

After Joliot-Curie's speech, the conference adjourned.

    世界和平大会开幕
    据新华社赫尔辛基二十三日电　世界和平大会二十二日下午在赫尔辛基的麦斯哈里厅开幕。在大会开幕前一小时，来自九十个国家近两千名代表就陆续来到宽广的会场。
    在世界和平理事会总书记拉斐德建议下，大会一致通过了由一百五十人组成的主席团名单。其中包括了参加这次大会的各种爱好和平力量的代表，有世界和平理事会的著名领袖、这次大会的发起人、科学和文化界领袖和公众组织代表等。芬兰社会事务部第二部长莱沃—拉逊夫人代表芬兰政府出席大会。
    大会选出的二十二日会议的主席约里奥—居里在暴风雨般的掌声中宣布世界和平大会开幕。
    世界和平理事会理事瓦伊诺·麦尔蒂代表芬兰的和平保卫者向大会致词，祝贺大会成功。他说，在这里聚集的代表们代表了比以前任何时候都要多的国家，这说明要求和平的愿望到处在增长。
    接着宣读了比利时王后伊丽莎白、印度著名社会活动家拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人、前墨西哥总统卡德纳斯和法国国民议会名誉议长赫里欧给世界和平大会的贺信。这些贺信受到了全场的热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    比利时王后伊丽莎白在信中表示希望大会能够实现它所提出的目标，从而有助于建立各国间的和睦和和平。
    拉·尼赫鲁夫人在信中说道，“世界和平大会是对各国爱好和平人民面临的问题的一个答复。我希望，各国人民从这一会议的讲坛上将作出谴责战争和使人类完全避免战争的神圣誓言。”
    卡德纳斯在信中主张为保障各国人民的自由和独立而进行有组织的和不断的斗争，以保证持久的世界和平。
      赫里欧在信中申述了他反对战争危险、反对德国军国主义复活的意愿，并表示要始终不倦地为反对热核子战争而斗争。他说：“我反对德国的军国主义复活，不是由于仇视德国；我们从前的一些敌人不愿谴责那些曾经给那么多人造成痛苦的暴行，而受到良心谴责的许多德国人是同意我们的意见的。他们的功绩是伟大的，全体和平主义者都应当感谢他们。我乐意表示这种感激的心情。我们还没有获得成功，但是我决没有失望。是否能消除曾经给人类造成那么多次灾难的恶魔，决定于各国人民的意志。这就是你们在赫尔辛基举行的大会的目的。
    “我们应当始终不倦地为反对热核子战争而斗争。人民的良知一定能使许多无辜的人们摆脱仍然威胁着他们的灾祸。亲爱的朋友，请接受我的支持，一个风烛残年的八十三岁的老人的支持。他将以全部剩余的精力恳求你们，在道义上紧密地团结，甚至比在政治上团结得更加坚强，消灭卑鄙的恶魔，保障各国人民安静生活的权利，特别是保护妇女和儿童，实现曾经向人类说过的最美好的话：
  ‘给世界上善良的人以和平’。”
    随后，世界和平理事会主席、著名的法国科学家约里奥—居里发表了长篇演说。
    约里奥—居里在演说里谈到国际局势和目前和平运动的任务。他指出，世界和平运动已经对于公众舆论产生了巨大影响，今天，世界舆论已成为一个积极的力量。但是，公众舆论还必须见诸实际行动，才能在保卫和平中进一步发挥它应有的作用。
    约里奥—居里指出，日内瓦会议关于结束印度支那战争的协议，缓和了国际紧张局势。以后，马尼拉会议所缔结的军事条约企图把亚洲分成敌对的集团。但是，另一个会议——二十九个亚非国家的万隆会议，吸引了整个世界的注意。万隆会议是国际协商的一个范例。会议所通过的十项原则是和平共处的一个真正宪章。它不仅对亚洲和非洲，而且对整个世界发生了极大的影响。
    在谈到欧洲问题的时候，约里奥—居里指出，巴黎协定的被批准成为缓和国际紧张局势的道路上的一个严重的障碍。但是，它绝不能阻止人们要求和平和用协商方式解决德国问题的意志。人们的这种意志越来越变成克服存在于和平道路上的新的障碍的力量。他举出奥地利国家条约缔结的例子，说明在许多国家中绝大部分人愿望维护他们的国家独立，认为不同社会制度的国家之间建立良好关系，是和平的重要因素。
    约里奥—居里还详细地谈到了世界人民要求禁止原子武器和氢武器、要求裁军的运动的开展。
    约里奥—居里谈到将在七月间在日内瓦召开的四国政府首脑会议时，指出全世界爱好和平的人民要求四国会议在解决重要的国际问题上获得成就。他在谈到联合国宪章签订十周年纪念时，指出必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织里的合法地位。约里奥—居里认为，四大国会议要获得重要的结果，必须跟着召开一个五大国会议。
    在约里奥—居里演说后，大会休会。
