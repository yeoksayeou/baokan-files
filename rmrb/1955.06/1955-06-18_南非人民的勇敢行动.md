    The Brave Actions of the People of South Africa

    The people of all races in the Union of South Africa have decided to convene the South African People's Congress on June 25th to formulate a "Freedom Charter" concerning their own rights. This event marks the beginning of further unity among the oppressed people of all races in South Africa, and marks a new development in their struggle against racial discrimination and for freedom and democratic rights. This brave action by the people of South Africa is sincerely welcomed by the Chinese people. Premier Zhou Enlai has sent a telegram on behalf of the Chinese people to the Congress expressing congratulations and stating that the Chinese people will continue to support the just struggle of the South African people.

    The South African government has consistently pursued a policy of racial discrimination and national oppression. The past Malan government openly declared: "Non-European people in South Africa can never obtain equal political rights with Europeans. There will never be social equality in South Africa. Europeans will always be the masters of South Africa." When the current Prime Minister Strijdom took office at the end of last year, he declared that he would strengthen the implementation of racial discrimination to "protect the whites and the authority of the whites." The South African government has promulgated dozens of reactionary laws of racial discrimination and oppression. Millions of Africans and Asians have suffered cruel economic exploitation and enslavement, and have been deprived of the most basic rights and freedoms in politics. According to the so-called "Group Areas Act," approximately three million black people have been driven into "segregated areas" that account for less than one-tenth of the national land area, and are not allowed to live in so-called "white areas." The racists in South Africa are even so barbaric as to stipulate that Africans must have a permit to walk on the streets at night. Anyone who violates the racial discrimination and segregation laws will be severely punished. In 1950 alone, 739,400 people were tried and sentenced for this reason, and a large part of them were "rented out" by the government authorities as slaves to mine owners or farm owners to engage in forced labor at low prices. The racial persecution of African and Asian people by the South African government has caused unspeakable suffering to the vast population of South Africa.

    For many years, the people of South Africa have taken a courageous stand and resolutely launched struggles against the tyranny of racial discrimination, striving for democracy and freedom. Despite the brutal suppression by the South African government, its various reactionary measures have still been met with increasingly strong resistance from the people. This situation has forced the South African Minister of Justice Swart to admit that the rulers of the Union of South Africa are "sitting on a volcano." The people of all races in South Africa are increasingly aware that the purpose of the racial discrimination and segregation policies implemented by the South African rulers is to create hatred and antagonism between ethnic groups in order to facilitate their intensified enslavement and exploitation. Therefore, the resistance of the vast number of colored people in South Africa against racial discrimination policies has also received the sympathy and support of progressive white people, and people of all races have increasingly strengthened their unity and joint action in the struggle. In March of this year, white and non-white workers in South Africa jointly formed a federation of trade unions. The upcoming South African People's Congress is an important signal of strengthened unity and struggle among people of all ethnic groups and social strata in South Africa.

    The just struggle of the South African people has been widely supported by progressive people around the world. People of all countries have continuously issued solemn condemnations of the fascist acts of the South African government. In 1952, the Seventh General Assembly of the United Nations also passed a resolution condemning South Africa's racial discrimination policy and demanding that the South African government stop implementing the "Group Areas Act." However, the government of the Union of South Africa, as a member of the United Nations, at the instigation of foreign colonialists, has refused to implement the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and has intensified the policy of racial persecution. This cannot but arouse stronger indignation throughout the world. Indian Prime Minister Nehru recently repeatedly criticized the South African government's atrocities of racial discrimination, and pointed out that this "shameless and brutal barbarism" is absolutely intolerable to the people of Asia and Africa.

    The unanimous attitude of the Asian and African people has been solemnly expressed in the final communiqué of the Asian-African Conference. The communiqué pointed out that the scourge of racism must be eradicated, and stated: "The Conference expressed its deep sympathy and support for the courageous stance taken by the victims of racial discrimination, especially the people of African, Indian and Pakistani descent in South Africa; commended all those who support their cause..." The resolutions of the Asian-African Conference greatly inspired and encouraged the South African people's struggle for democracy and freedom. Racial discrimination and national oppression are one of the most shameful stains of our time. The struggle of the South African people is to strive for their freedom and democratic rights, and also to eliminate this shameful stain. Their just cause is bound to be victorious.

### 南非人民的勇敢行动

    南非人民的勇敢行动
    南非联邦各族人民决定在六月二十五日召开南非人民代表大会，来制定一个有关他们的自身权利的“自由宪章”。这件盛事标志着南非各族被压迫人民的进一步团结的开始，标志着他们为反对种族歧视、争取自由和民主权利而进行的斗争的新发展。南非人民的这种勇敢行动受到中国人民的真诚欢迎。我国周恩来总理已代表中国人民对大会复电表示祝贺，并表示中国人民将继续支持南非人民的正义斗争。
    南非政府一贯实行种族歧视和民族压迫的政策。过去的马兰政府曾公开宣布：“非欧洲人民在南非永远不能获得和欧洲人同等的政治权利。南非永远也不会有社会地位平等的事情。欧洲人永远是南非洲的主人。”现任总理斯揣敦在去年年底上台的时候，又声明要加强实行种族歧视来“保护白人和白人的权威”。南非政府所颁行的种族歧视和压迫的反动法律有几十种之多，数百万非洲人和亚洲人在经济上受尽了残酷的剥削和奴役，在政治上被剥夺了最起码的权利和自由。根据所谓“种族隔离法案”，约有三百万黑人被赶进了面积不到全国土地面积十分之一的“隔离区”，而不准他们在所谓“白人地区”居住。南非的种族主义者甚至蛮横到这样的程度，他们竟规定，非洲人在晚上非持有许可证不得在街上行走。凡是违反了种族歧视和隔离法令的，都要受到严厉处罚。在一九五○年一年中，因此而被审判和判刑的就有七十三万九千四百人，而其中很大一部分被政府当局当做奴隶一样贱价“出租”给矿场主或农场主从事强迫劳动。南非政府对非洲和亚洲人民施行的种族迫害，使南非广大人民遭受的痛苦是难以描述的。
    南非人民多年来采取了勇敢的立场，坚决展开斗争反对种族歧视的暴政，争取民主和自由。尽管南非政府采取了残暴的镇压手段，但是它的各种反动措施仍然遭受到人民日益坚强的反抗。这种情形使南非的司法部长斯瓦特不得不承认，南非联邦的统治者是“坐在火山口上”。南非各族人民愈来愈清楚地认识到，南非统治者所实行的种族歧视和隔离的政策，目的是在制造各民族间的仇视和对立，以便利他们加紧奴役和剥削。因此南非广大有色人民对种族歧视政策的反抗，也得到了进步的白色人民的同情和支持，各族人民并在斗争中日益加强了团结和联合行动。今年三月间南非的白色和非白色工人已共同组成了一个工会联合会。即将举行的南非人民代表大会更是南非各民族、各阶层人民加强团结斗争的重要信号。
    南非人民的正义斗争，一直受到全世界进步人类的广泛支持。各国人民不断对南非政府的法西斯行径发出严正的谴责。一九五二年联合国第七届大会并曾通过决议，斥责南非种族歧视政策，要求南非政府停止实施“种族隔离法案”。但是作为联合国的会员国的南非联邦的政府，在外国殖民主义者的怂恿下，竟拒绝执行联合国大会的决议，并且变本加厉地实行种族迫害的政策。这不能不在全世界激起更强烈的义愤。印度总理尼赫鲁不久前曾一再抨击南非政府的种族歧视暴行，并且指出这种“无耻的和残酷的野蛮行为”是亚洲和非洲人民所决不能容忍的。
    亚洲和非洲人民的一致态度已在亚非会议最后公报中庄严地表达出来。公报指出种族主义的祸害必须根除，并且说：“会议热烈同情和支持种族歧视的受害者，特别是南非境内非洲、印度和巴基斯坦血统的人民所采取的勇敢立场；赞扬所有支持他们的事业的人们……”。亚非会议的决议大大激励和鼓舞了南非人民争取民主和自由的斗争。种族歧视和民族压迫是我们这个时代最可耻的污点之一。南非人民的斗争是为了争取他们的自由和民主权利，也是为了扫除这种可耻的污点。他们的正义事业是一定要胜利的。
