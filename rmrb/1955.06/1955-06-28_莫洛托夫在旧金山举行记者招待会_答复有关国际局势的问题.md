Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, June 26th: V.M. Molotov held a press conference on June 25th, meeting with American and foreign journalists in San Francisco and answering their questions on the international situation.

The following are the questions from the reporters and the answers from V.M. Molotov:

	Question (Paul Rankin, Reuters): Mr. Molotov, are you suggesting a substantive discussion of the German question at the Geneva conference, and can you tell us your views on the possibility of German reunification and any suggestions you may have regarding German neutralization?
	Answer: As you all know, the Soviet Union is in favor of German reunification. Of course, we are in favor of reunification on a peaceful and democratic basis. As for the Geneva conference, you know that the agenda of the conference will be decided by the heads of government themselves. We will all be very interested to see how the conference will discuss this or that issue, especially the one Mr. Rankin just mentioned.

	Question (Walter Kerr, "New York Herald Tribune"): Mr. Foreign Minister, are the four governments quite clear that the Geneva conference will last at most one week?
	Answer: The issue of the time limit for the Geneva conference has been discussed, and it has been agreed that no time limit should be set in advance. The conference itself will show how much time is needed.

	Question (Joseph Lashi, "New York Post"): Mr. Foreign Minister, in your speech on Wednesday, you said that the United Nations has a responsibility to resolve the Taiwan issue as soon as possible. Does this mean that if the United Nations makes a resolution that is inconsistent with the positions of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union will be willing to abide by such a resolution?
	Answer: The United Nations is very clear about its position in resolving such issues of international significance. As for the issue of Taiwan and the coastal islands of China, I believe that the proposal made by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai for direct negotiations between China and the United States is extremely important. Such negotiations are useful and conducive to consolidating peace. And the consolidation of peace is what the people of all countries desire.

	Question (Pauline Frederick, NBC): Mr. Foreign Minister, will the Geneva conference discuss the Taiwan issue?
	Answer: As I have said, no agenda has been set for the conference. This is a matter for the heads of government to decide themselves.

	Question (Garnett Horner, Washington "Star"): Can you tell us anything about the incident of the attack on the American plane that Mr. Dulles talked about yesterday?
	Answer: Mr. Dulles told me about this yesterday. This is news to me; I had no news in this regard yesterday. As soon as I receive any news, I will definitely contact Mr. Dulles.

	Question (Edward Morgan, ABC): Mr. Minister, do you think that this week in San Francisco has achieved success in promoting East-West understanding? If so, what are the achievements?
	Answer: I think that the San Francisco gathering has achieved positive results due to the various talks and contacts that have taken place. In this regard, it is difficult to point to any specific issues, because the talks and contacts involved many issues.

	Question (Chalmers Roberts, "Washington Post and Times Herald"): The Western ministers seem to be taking the attitude that they will not try to reach an agreement on substantive issues at Geneva, but only arrange procedures for future negotiations. Is this attitude acceptable to the Soviet Union?
	Answer: I can say that people are expressing all sorts of views and hopes about the Geneva conference. But this is ultimately a matter for the heads of government themselves; they should discuss and decide these issues themselves.

	Question (Frank Carpenter, Associated Press): Mr. Molotov, what is your reaction to Mr. Dulles's statement yesterday?
	Answer: Mr. Dulles explained the position of the United States. Two days before that, I explained the position of the Soviet Union. This is all I can answer at the moment.

	Question (A. Meisner, London "Daily Mirror"): Mr. Minister, is the Soviet Union prepared to formally raise the Taiwan issue at the United Nations?
	Answer: This issue is not currently under discussion.

	Question (Krishna Balalraman, Indian reporter from Madras): Would you be willing to tell us your assessment of the current military situation in the Formosa area? Do you think this situation is deteriorating, or not deteriorating?
	Answer: In my opinion, the situation in the Taiwan—you call it "Formosa"—area is fraught with military danger, that is, the danger of disrupting peace. I don't think the current situation is deteriorating. But the danger has not disappeared.

	Question (Mrs. Vera Dean, Foreign Policy Association): Mr. Molotov, can you tell us some details about the European security system you proposed, and how similar is this system to Mr. Pinay's proposal for inter-regional agreements between regional security systems?
	Answer: The proposal for an all-European collective security system was put forward by the Soviet Union at the beginning of last year. The essence of this proposal is that this system should guarantee the security of all European countries—regardless of their social systems. In addition, at present, the two parts of Germany—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—can participate in this system. After German reunification, a unified Germany will participate in this system. How different this system is from Mr. Pinay's proposal remains to be studied. The main purpose of the Soviet proposal for European collective security is to resolve the issue of military blocs in Europe, the issue of military blocs formed by certain countries against other countries. The purpose of this proposal is to guarantee the peace and security of all European countries.

	Question (Larry LeSueur, CBS): Mr. Minister, will Premier Bulganin lead the Soviet delegation to Geneva?
	Answer: Yes, of course.

	Question (James Reston, "New York Times" commentator): Sir, please allow me to ask you two questions. First, it seems to us that there have been great changes in Soviet policy, especially towards Yugoslavia, Austria, and Germany, and we are very interested in this at home. How should these changes be explained? My second question is: when you say that you are in favor of German reunification on a peaceful and democratic basis, can we infer from this that you mean to extend the system that currently exists in East Germany?
	Answer: I will briefly answer your first question. If Mr. Reston carefully studies the course of events, he will see that the recent measures of Soviet foreign policy are a consistent development of the Soviet Union's consistently implemented foreign policy of consolidating peace.

Now let's talk about your second question. When the Soviet Union put forward its proposal for the reunification of Germany, it believed that the regime currently existing in East Germany should not be extended to a unified Germany, just as the regime currently existing in West Germany should not be extended. As for what kind of regime a unified Germany will have, this is a matter to be resolved by the German people themselves through free all-German elections.

Our time is only half an hour. We have used this time. I would like to express my gratitude for your attention.

	Question (Paul Rankin, Reuters): You mentioned a European security system that includes all European countries. Do you agree with Dr. Adenauer's suggestion that the United States and Canada should also participate in this security system as full members?
	Answer: We have expressed our opinion: we have no doubt in our minds that the United States can participate in the all-European collective security system, if it wishes.

Finally, the reporters expressed their thanks for the press conference.

    莫洛托夫在旧金山举行记者招待会
    答复有关国际局势的问题
    新华社讯　塔斯社旧金山二十六日电：六月二十五日，维·米·莫洛托夫举行记者招待会，会见在旧金山的美国和外国记者，回答他们所提出的问题。
    以下是记者的问题和维·米·莫洛托夫的答复：
    问（路透社记者保罗·兰金）：莫洛托夫先生，你是否建议在日内瓦会议上对德国问题作实质的讨论，你是否能告诉我们你对于德国重新统一的可能性的看法以及你关于德国中立化的任何建议？
    答：你们都清楚知道，苏联是赞成德国的重新统一的。当然，我们赞成的是在和平和民主基础上的统一。至于日内瓦会议，你们知道会议的议程将由各国政府首脑自己商定。我们大家都将怀着极大的兴趣等着瞧会议将怎样地讨论这一个或那一个问题，其中特别是兰金先生刚刚谈到的那个问题。
    问（“纽约先驱论坛报”记者华尔特·凯尔）：外长先生，四国政府是否十分明确地理解日内瓦会议至多只开一个星期？
    答：关于日内瓦会议的时限问题曾进行了讨论，并且已经商定事先不应规定任何期限。会议本身将说明需要多长时间。
    问（“纽约邮报”记者约瑟夫·拉希）：外长先生，你在星期三的演说中说联合国组织有责任尽早解决台湾问题。这是否意味着，如果联合国作出一个同苏联和中华人民共和国的立场不一致的决议，苏联是否愿意遵守这样的决议？
    答：联合国很清楚地知道它在解决这样一些具有国际意义的问题方面占有的地位。至于台湾和中国沿海岛屿问题，我相信中国总理周恩来提出的、关于中国和美国举行直接谈判的建议是极为重要的。这种谈判是有用的，是有利于巩固和平的。而巩固和平是各国人民所希望的。
    问（全国广播公司记者波林纳·弗雷德里克）：外长先生，日内瓦会议将讨论台湾问题吗？
    答：我已经说过，没有为会议拟定任何议程。这是应由各国政府首脑亲自来决定的事。
    问（华盛顿“明星报”记者加奈特·霍尔纳）：关于杜勒斯先生昨天谈到的美国飞机被袭击的事情，你能告诉我们什么消息吗？
    答：杜勒斯先生昨天告诉我这件事情。这对我还是新闻，在这方面昨天我还没有什么消息。我一接到任何消息，就一定同杜勒斯先生联系。
    问（美国广播公司记者爱德华·摩根）：部长先生，你觉得这星期在旧金山在促进东西方谅解方面获得了成就吗？如果获得的话，是什么成就？
    答：我觉得，由于所进行的各种会谈和接触，旧金山集会是获得了积极的结果的。在这方面，很难指出任何具体问题来，因为会谈和接触中所涉及的问题很多。
    问（“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”记者查默斯·罗伯茨）：西方的部长们似乎采取这种态度：在日内瓦将不努力在实质问题上达成协议，而只为将来的谈判安排程序。这种态度可以为苏联接受吗？
    答：我可以说，人们正对日内瓦会议表示各种各样的看法和希望。但是这到底只是政府首脑们自己的事，他们应该自己讨论和决定这些问题。
    问（美联社记者弗兰克·卡本特尔）：莫洛托夫先生，你对杜勒斯先生昨天的发言反应如何？
    答：杜勒斯先生说明了美国的态度。在这以前两天，我说明了苏联的态度。这就是我目前所能作的回答。
    问（伦敦“每日镜报”记者阿·麦兹尼克）：部长先生，苏联是否准备向联合国正式提出台湾问题？
    答：这个问题目前没有讨论。
    问（来自马德拉斯的印度记者克里希纳·巴拉拉曼）：你是否愿意告诉我们你对福摩萨地区目前的军事局势的估计。你认为这种局势在恶化下去，还是没有恶化？
    答：在我看来，台湾——你称它为“福摩萨”——地区的局势充满了军事性质的危险，即破坏和平的危险。我认为，目前的局势并没有恶化。但是危险却并没有消失。
    问（外交政策协会维拉·迪安夫人）：莫洛托夫先生，你能否告诉我们一些关于你所建议的欧洲安全体系的详细内容，以及这种体系同比内先生关于地区性安全体系间的区际协议的建议相似的程度？
    答：全欧集体安全体系的建议是苏联在去年年初提出来的。这个建议的实质是：这种体系应该保证欧洲各国——不论它们的社会制度有什么不同——的安全。此外，目前，德国的两部分——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国——是可以参加这种体系的。德国统一以后，将由统一的德国参加这一体系。这一体系同比内先生的建议有多大的不同还需要研究。苏联关于欧洲集体安全的建议的主要目的，就是解决欧洲的军事集团问题，某些国家针对其他一些国家而结成的军事集团的问题。这个建议的目的，就是保证欧洲各国的和平和安全。
    问（哥伦比亚广播公司记者拉里·利苏埃尔）：部长先生，布尔加宁总理将率领苏联代表团去日内瓦吗？
    答：是的，当然啰。
    问（“纽约时报”评论员詹姆斯·赖斯顿）：先生，请允许我向你提两个问题。第一，据我们看来，苏联政策，特别是对南斯拉夫、奥地利和德国的政策发生了很大的改变，我们国内现在对这一点很感兴趣。这种改变应当怎样解释？我的第二个问题是：当你说你赞成德国在和平民主的基础上的统一时，我们能不能由此而认为你的意思是说要扩展现存于东德的制度呢？
    答：我将简短地回答你的第一个问题。如果赖斯顿先生仔细地研究各种事件的过程，他将可以看到：最近苏联采取的外交政策的措施是苏联一向执行的巩固和平的外交政策的一贯发展。
    现在谈你的第二个问题。苏联在提出它的重新统一德国的建议时认为，不应该把现存于东德的政权扩展到统一的德国，正像不应该把现存于西德的政权加以扩展。至于一个统一的德国将拥有哪一种政权的问题，这是一个由德国人民自己通过自由的全德选举来解决的问题。
    我们的时间只有半小时。我们已经利用了这一段时间。我谨对你们的注意表示感谢。
    问（路透社记者保罗·兰金）：你提到一个包括所有欧洲国家的欧洲安全体系。你是否同意阿登纳博士的建议，同意美国和加拿大也作为一个享有全部权利的成员参加这个安全体系？
    答：我们已经表示了我们的意见：我们心中毫不怀疑，美国可以参加全欧集体安全体系，如果它愿意的话。
    最后，记者们对记者招待会表示感谢。
