    Indian Cultural Delegation Performs Puppet Dance Drama for Beijing Children

    (Our Newspaper News) The Little Ballet Troupe of the Indian Cultural Delegation performed a wonderful puppet dance drama "The Story of Rama" for Beijing children at the Beijing People's Theater on the morning of the 14th.

    More than 1,500 people, including the Young Pioneers of Beijing and members of the China Children's Theater Troupe attached to the China Youth Art Theater, watched the performance.

    At the opening, the children were attracted by a colorful and vibrant market scene. Here, the puppet performers reported the theme of the dance drama. Then the audience saw the famous story of the brave Prince Rama: his wedding to the beautiful Sita, their exile to the forest, Sita's abduction by the demon king, and Rama's final victory over his enemies.

    Most of the members of the Little Ballet Troupe are children in their teens. They wear puppet masks and costumes, performing the movements of people and animals, both seriously and humorously. This puppet dance drama, which combines ballet and puppetry, was warmly welcomed by the children of the capital.

    Cheng Shiru, an actor from the China Children's Theater Troupe attached to the China Youth Art Theater, said after watching the puppet dance drama: "The actors of the Indian Little Ballet Troupe used simple movements to perform the inner activities of the characters. This has given me a great inspiration, and I must learn from their serious, conscientious, and hardworking work style and attitude."

    印度文化代表团为北京儿童表演傀儡舞剧
    本报讯　印度文化代表团小巴蕾舞剧团十四日上午在北京人民剧场为北京儿童演出了一场精采的傀儡舞剧“罗摩的故事”。
    北京的少年先锋队员、中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团团员等一千五百多名观看了这次演出。
    一开幕，儿童们就被一个五色缤纷、富有生气的市集的景色吸引住了。在这里傀儡的表演者报告了这个舞剧的主题。接着观众看到了勇敢的罗摩王子的有名故事：他和美丽的悉达的婚礼，他们被流放到森林里，悉达被魔王拐骗，以及罗摩最后战胜了他的敌人。
    小巴蕾舞剧团的团员大多是十多岁的孩子。他们穿戴着傀儡面具和戏装，表演着人和动物的动作，既认真又诙谐。这个由巴蕾舞和傀儡戏结合成的傀儡舞剧获得了首都儿童热烈欢迎。
    中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团的演员程式如看了傀儡舞剧后说：印度小巴蕾舞剧团的演员用简单的动作把人物内心的活动都表演出来了。这点给我的启发很大，我一定要学习他们的严肃、认真、刻苦的工作作风和态度。
