    Successful Experiment of Rock Drilling Method for Preventing Silicosis

    The Second Engineering Bureau of the newly built railway has achieved success in using the wet rock drilling method to prevent silicosis in the Gaotanzi Tunnel on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The wet rock drilling method involves sending both air and water to the pneumatic drill, stopping the rock dust that used to harm the eyes and lungs of tunnel workers from flying around, and improving the efficiency of the pneumatic drill. Now, the Gaotanzi Tunnel project is preparing to use this method for all rock drilling; the Second Engineering Bureau of the newly built railway also plans to apply this method to all mechanically excavated tunnel projects on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway before the end of this year. The first batch of high-pressure water tanks needed for using the wet rock drilling method is already being manufactured at the mechanical repair plant of the Second Engineering Bureau of the newly built railway.

    预防矽肺的凿岩法试验成功
    新建铁路第二工程局在宝成铁路南段高潭子隧道采用预防矽肺的湿式凿岩法获得成功。湿式凿岩法就是把空气和水同时送到风钻上，使一向危害隧道工人眼睛和肺部的岩粉停止飞扬，并可提高风钻效率。现在，高潭子隧道工程准备全部采用这种方法凿岩；新建铁路第二工程局还计划在今年年底以前，把这一方法使用到宝成铁路南段所有机械开挖的隧道工程中去。现在第一批为使用湿式凿岩法需要的高压水箱，已经在新建铁路第二工程局机械修配厂制造。　　（新华社）
