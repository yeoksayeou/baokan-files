    Reading the first batch of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique while we were conducting interviews in the old revolutionary base area of Jiangxi, my mind was filled with figures and events sufficient to illustrate the fierce class struggles of the past: the thatched huts on Jinggang Mountain burned seven times by the White bandits, the widowed old woman whose husband and sons were killed by the landlord's armed forces, the earthen slope where the enemy collectively shot and killed wounded and sick Red Army soldiers, all were accusing the enemy of brutality and inhumanity; on the other hand, the deeds of the Red guerrillas' arduous struggle and the Party membership cards, Red Guard team flags, and Red Army banknotes hidden by the people in wall cracks and under wall foundations... all demonstrated that even under the most severe White Terror, the people firmly believed that the Communist Party would lead the revolution to victory. Revisiting revolutionary historical materials made me feel even more the preciousness of victory and the loveliness of the new society. "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China" is a truth I repeatedly experienced while visiting the old revolutionary base areas.

    Singing the praises of the Party, the people, and the revolution is the unshirkable responsibility of literary and art workers in New China. When we come into more contact with the struggle and life, this sense of responsibility becomes even stronger.

    However, Hu Feng and the members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique hid within the revolutionary literary and art camp to carry out anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiracies. They hated the leadership of the Party, they cursed the victory of the revolution, and they consciously uglified the people in their works. From the materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, one can see how deeply Hu Feng hated the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. How is his ferocious face any different from those "heroes" who launched the "encirclement and suppression of communists" back then? What about the "whip of steel wire wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners"? How is this method any different from the executioners who tortured revolutionaries during the White Terror? Now the truth is out: it turns out that Hu Feng indeed engaged in anti-communist activities in the "encirclement and suppression of communists" army, and he himself was a special agent.

    The exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique has made me realize even more what Chairman Mao said: today's victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles. We still need to wage more arduous and complex struggles against enemies both internal and external (especially hidden and disguised enemies). Let us strengthen our ideological armaments, heighten our vigilance, and unite more closely under the banner of the Party to defeat all enemies, armed and unarmed!

    战胜一切拿枪和不拿枪的敌人
    瞿希贤
    读到揭露胡风反革命集团的第一批材料时，我们正在江西老根据地进行采访，我的脑子里正充满着足以说明过去激烈阶级斗争的人物和事件：井冈山上被白匪烧过七次的茅屋，被地主武装杀死丈夫、儿子的孤老婆婆，敌人集体枪杀红军伤病员的土坡，都在向我们控诉敌人的残暴无人性；另一方面，红色游击队艰苦斗争的事迹和人民埋藏在墙缝里、墙脚下的党证、赤卫队队旗、红军票……都说明着即使在最严重的白色恐怖下，人民也坚信共产党会把革命引向胜利。重温革命史料，使我更感到胜利的可贵和新社会的可爱。“没有共产党就没有新中国”，是我在访问老根据地中一再体会到的真理。
    歌颂党、歌颂人民、歌颂革命是新中国文艺工作者义不容辞的责任。当我们和斗争生活接触更多时，这种责任感也就更强烈。
    但是胡风和胡风反革命集团分子却隐藏在革命的文艺阵营内进行反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋活动，他们仇视党的领导，他们诅咒革命的胜利，他们有意识地在作品中丑化人民。从关于胡风反革命集团的材料中，可以看到胡风对中国人民的革命事业如何恨入骨髓。他这副狰狞面目和当年发动“剿共”的“好汉”们有何不同？什么“橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”，这种手段和当年白色恐怖中摧残革命者的刽子手又有何不同？现在真相大白了，原来胡风确在“剿共”军中干过反共的勾当，他本人就是一个特务分子。
    胡风反党集团的被揭露，使我更体会到毛主席所说今天的胜利只是万里长征的第一步，我们还需要和内外敌人（特别是隐藏着的、伪装着的敌人），作更艰巨复杂的斗争。让我们加强思想上的武装、提高警惕、更紧密地团结在党的旗帜下，去战胜一切拿枪的和不拿枪的敌人吧！
