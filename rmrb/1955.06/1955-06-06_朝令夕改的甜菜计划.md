The Beet Plan That Changes in the Morning and Evening
Editor:

This year in February, the Heilongjiang Provincial Planning Commission held a meeting of planning and statistics section chiefs. At the meeting, it was decided that Boli County in the Hejiang Special District should plant 1,000 hectares of beets. After receiving this task, the Boli County People's Committee immediately conducted ideological mobilization among all levels of staff to support national economic construction and complete the national plan; at the same time, it revised the county's agricultural production plan.

When the revised plan had just been issued to districts and villages, it was decided at the agricultural section chiefs meeting held by the Provincial Department of Agriculture that Boli County would not plant beets. After receiving the instructions from the Department of Agriculture, Boli County deliberated and decided to revise the plan and transmit it downwards.

On April 20th, Boli County received a telephone instruction from the Hejiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office saying: "The Commissioner's Office has decided that your county needs to plant 500 hectares of beets..." and requested that it be immediately arranged to districts and villages (at this time, farmers had already started spring plowing, and the crops they wanted to plant had already been arranged). The County People's Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Hejiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, quickly notified the districts and villages. From the county to the districts, and from the districts to the villages, it took several days. Although village cadres and farmers felt it was too late to plant beets, they still actively rushed to plant them in order to obey the national plan.

At this time, the plows had already been put to the ground, and no one expected any more changes. However, things turned out to be contrary to people's expectations. At noon on April 24th, Boli County received another telephone instruction from the Hejiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office: ...Your county will not plant beets...".

Before Boli County could transmit this notice, at about 2:00 PM on the same day, it received another call from the Prefectural Commissioner's Office: "Your county should still complete the 500 hectares of beets according to the original plan..." The seven words "This is the Commissioner's decision" were specially added at the end. Although the comrades in the county felt that the plan had changed too much and there were difficulties in its implementation, they still implemented it.

People were convinced that the Commissioner's decision must be the final decision. District and village cadres led cooperatives and mutual aid teams to start leveling the land, turning over the land originally intended for flax and good land for planting large fields, preparing to plant beet seeds. Unexpectedly, on April 29th, the Hejiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office issued another instruction saying: "The province has instructed that the Hejiang area will not plant beets, and of course, your Boli County will not plant them either."

Up to this point, the "Beet Plan" went through nearly three months from February to April, changing back and forth five times before it was finally declared over.

Why is the beet plan in the Hejiang area so changeable? This question needs to be answered by the relevant units.

### 朝令夕改的甜菜计划

    朝令夕改的甜菜计划编辑同志：
    今年二月间，黑龙江省计划委员会召开了计划统计科长会议，会上布置合江专区的勃利县要种植甜菜一千垧。勃利县人民委员会接到这一任务后，立即向各级工作人员进行了支援国家经济建设、完成国家计划的思想动员；同时修订了全县农业生产计划。
    当修订的计划刚下达到区、村的时候，在省农业厅召开的农业科长会议上又决定勃利县不种甜菜了。勃利县接到农业厅的指示后，经过一番斟酌，决定把计划作了修改，向下传达。
    四月二十日，勃利县又接到了合江专署的电话指示说：“专署决定你县需种甜菜五百垧……”并要求马上布置到区、村（这时农民已经开始春耕，农民要种的东西早已安排好了）。县人民委员会又按照合江专署的指示，迅速通知了各区、村，由县到区，由区到村又得经过几天。村干部和农民虽然感到种甜菜已晚了，但是为了服从国家计划，大家仍是积极赶种。
    这时，犁杖已经下地了，谁也没料到还会有什么变动。可是，事情恰恰出乎人们的意料之外。四月二十四日午前，勃利县又接到合江专署电话指示：……你县不种甜菜了……。
    勃利县还没有来得及把这一通知传达下去，当天下午两点钟左右，又接到专署的电话：“你县还要按原计划完成甜菜五百垧……”后面还特意加了七个字：“这是专员的决定”。县里的同志虽然感到计划变动太多，在执行上是有困难的，但仍然执行了。
    人们满以为专员的决定一定是最后的决定了。区、村干部领导着合作社、互助组开始整地，把原来准备种亚麻的地和种大田的好地都翻整了，准备下甜菜种。不料，四月二十九日，合江专署又来了指示说：“省里指示，合江地区不种甜菜了，当然你们勃利县也不种了。”
    至此，“甜菜计划”从二月到四月经历了将近三个月的时间，反反复复变动了五次，才宣告结束。
    为什么合江地区的甜菜计划这样多变呢？这个问题需要有关单位来回答。
