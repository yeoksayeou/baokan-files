    Launch a Comprehensive Labor Emulation Drive in the Food Company System
    Chen Jingzhi, Deputy Manager of China Food Company
    From May 26th to June 2nd, the Ministry of Commerce and the National Committee of the National Food Industry Workers' Union convened a conference of worker representatives from the national food company system in Beijing. The conference exchanged advanced experiences, discussed, and arranged for a comprehensive labor emulation drive.
    The management of non-staple foods is an important issue concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood. Doing a good job in the purchase and supply of non-staple foods and fulfilling export tasks are of great significance for promoting the development of production, supporting national industrial construction, gradually meeting the needs of urban and rural people, especially in urban and mining areas, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. In recent years, the operation of non-staple foods has developed greatly and achieved certain results; but it is undeniable that there are still quite serious problems in operation and management. The phenomenon of "dead pigs, rotten eggs, and spoiled fruits" is still relatively common, which not only causes significant economic losses to the country, but also causes adverse political effects. In 1954, due to poor management, the food company not only failed to complete the task of capital accumulation, but also suffered a large loss. Although some progress has been made in some areas this year, the national situation has not changed, which is not in line with national requirements. In the past, our political work was weak, and some leading staff and workers lacked sufficient understanding of the significance of non-staple food management, and had a sense of unease and negative aversion to difficulties, which hindered the improvement of operation and management.
    With the expansion of the food company's business tasks, if this situation cannot be changed quickly, it will be difficult to complete the tasks assigned by the state and the people. Therefore, launching a comprehensive labor emulation drive in the food company system to improve the political and ideological consciousness and management level of all employees is a very urgent task.
    The requirements of the labor emulation drive in the food company system are: under the premise of correctly implementing policies, completing purchase and sales plans, doing a good job in purchasing and supplying, improving operation and management, and gradually achieving that fresh and live commodities do not die, rot, or spoil; the national average loss rate is required to be reduced to: a mortality rate of less than 0.7 percent for live pigs, 0.15 percent for live cattle, and 0.25 percent for live sheep; and it is required that they gain weight and grow meat within a certain area and within a certain period. The loss rate of fresh eggs is 3.5 percent; the spoilage rate of fruits is 4 percent. Strive to reduce the pure turnover of commodities by 1 percent according to the approved 1955 expense plan level, and save 180 million yuan in expenditure to ensure the completion of the 1955 profit remittance task.
    The practice of many advanced units has proved that the above requirements can be achieved. For example, the live pigs kept and raised in the Changsha No. 1 Warehouse of the Hunan Provincial Food Company not only reduced the mortality rate to 0.08 percent, but also gained a total weight of 1.67 million catties (gross weight) throughout the year. After deducting the cost of feeding, they also earned 387,000 yuan; the Xuchang Food Company of Henan Province created the experience of no pig deaths during long-distance transportation; and the Jiangyan Purchasing Station of Jiangsu Province only had a pig mortality rate of 0.0448 percent due to the implementation of the "four-member responsibility system." These all show that although there are difficulties in the operation of fresh and live commodities, they can be completely overcome through the efforts of all employees.
    How to carry out the production increase and conservation labor emulation drive in the food company system? Which links should be grasped in carrying out the labor emulation drive?
    First, on the basis of the existing work, further rectify the organizational structure and improve the working system. Through the labor emulation drive, mobilize the power of the masses to promote the establishment and improvement of the organization and system, and at the same time use a sound organizational structure and working system to ensure the persistence and consolidation of the labor emulation drive. Since its establishment last year, the China Food Company has seen great development in its national organization and personnel, and has also established some necessary systems and gained some advanced working experience. This is a favorable condition for carrying out the production increase and conservation labor emulation drive. However, since the implementation of assigned raising and purchasing of live pigs, the work of the food company has become more complex and heavy, and the existing organization cannot fully meet the needs of work development, especially the lack of veterinarians, accountants, and business technicians. In order to improve work, complete tasks, and ensure the smooth development of the production increase and conservation labor emulation drive, these personnel should be strengthened and equipped in a planned way to gradually improve the organization in various places. However, in the construction of the organizational structure, we must conscientiously implement the spirit of streamlining and economizing on the reorganization of organizations, and oppose the blind increase of organizations and the waste of manpower. While rectifying the organization, we must also improve various working systems, especially the gradual establishment of a responsibility system, a reward and punishment system, a technical operation system, and a commodity inspection system, in order to ensure the normal progress of work. Without a sound organization and system, it is difficult to carry out the labor emulation drive in a comprehensive and sustained manner, but we must never use the unsoundness of the organization and system as an excuse to passively treat the development of the labor emulation drive. We must combine the two, promote each other, and develop each other.
    Second, strengthen political and ideological education, improve the socialist consciousness of the vast number of employees, and eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible in the work. Although many advanced workers have emerged in the work of food companies in the past, there are also many units and links with serious phenomena of no one being responsible. For example, purchasing personnel do not care about the quality of goods, resulting in a large amount of weight loss in live pigs; transportation personnel cannot take good care of the safety of livestock and ensure the quality of goods; and breeding personnel do not cherish livestock, feed them improperly, and have poor sanitary conditions. These phenomena seriously affect the improvement of work. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to conduct thorough ideological education for all employees, explaining the important position and role of commercial work in national construction, the important significance of doing a good job in the purchase and supply of non-staple foods, etc., improve the socialist consciousness of employees, give full play to their enthusiasm and initiative in work; improve the labor enthusiasm of all employees, strengthen the sense of responsibility for work, and resolutely eliminate all irresponsible phenomena in work; to ensure the normal development of the labor emulation drive.
    Third, strengthen business and technical learning, improve the scientific and technical level in various management links, and promote advanced working experience. The commodities operated by food companies are mostly fresh or alive. Certain techniques are required in the appraisal of purchase specifications, packaging, transportation, feeding, storage, and processing and production operations. If the technology cannot be improved to make the existing technology and experience conform to scientific principles, it is easy to cause accidents and cause losses. This is not only detrimental to the operation of the entire enterprise, causing significant economic losses, but also directly related to the people's health and the spread of livestock diseases, causing adverse political effects. Therefore, in carrying out the production increase and conservation labor emulation drive, organizing all employees to strengthen business and technical learning and improve the scientific and technical level is an extremely important task. At present, we should mainly give play to the wisdom of the masses, summarize and promote advanced working experience. For example, the live pig feeding and management methods of the Changsha No. 1 Warehouse of the Hunan Food Company and the feeding and management experience of the Xuchang Food Company of Henan Province in transporting live pigs by train have been proven by practice and scientific summarization, and all localities should learn well and earnestly promote them. In addition, we must also be good at learning from experienced veterinarians, health personnel, and business technicians.
    Fourth, in the overall leadership of the enterprise, we should strengthen the planning of work, improve the management level of socialist commerce, and oppose the capitalist management ideology and the subjective and bureaucratic style of work. The operation of socialist commerce proceeds from the interests of the state and the people, and serves the needs of production and consumers. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly implement policies, strengthen planning management according to the development of the entire national economy, and improve the accuracy of planning. Only in this way can the management level of socialist commerce be improved. How can we strengthen planning? The most important thing is to strengthen investigation and research, formulate plans in a realistic manner according to objective laws, and ensure the completion of the plans. The second is to improve the socialist business ideology, oppose the capitalist business ideology, and all employees must clearly recognize that the purpose of all activities of socialist commerce is to promote material exchange and production development, to gradually improve the material and cultural living standards of the people, and to build socialism. The method of accumulating funds is to complete it through careful calculation and strict economy. Therefore, it is necessary to especially emphasize the correct implementation of policies; establish an overall concept and oppose departmentalism; emphasize efforts to improve operation and management, accumulate funds, and oppose the capitalist view of purely making profits.
    The conference of worker representatives of the food company has come to a successful conclusion. The commercial administrative departments in various places should, under the leadership of the Party and government at all levels, conscientiously implement the resolutions of this conference, mobilize all employees to comprehensively carry out the labor emulation drive, and quickly change the situation of poor operation and management of food companies.

    在食品公司系统全面开展劳动竞赛
    中国食品公司副经理  陈静之
    五月二十六日到六月二日，商业部和中国店员工会全国委员会在北京召开了全国食品公司系统的职工代表会议，交流了先进经验，讨论并布置了全面开展劳动竞赛。
    副食品的经营是有关国计民生的重要问题之一。做好副食品的收购、供应工作和完成出口任务，对促进生产的发展，支援国家工业建设，逐步满足城乡人民，特别是城市、工矿区的需要和巩固工农联盟，有重要的意义。几年来，副食品的经营有了很大的发展，并取得了一定的成绩；但也不可否认在经营管理上仍有相当严重的问题，“猪死、蛋臭、水果烂”的现象，还比较普遍地存在，不但给国家造成了经济上的重大损失，而且也引起了政治上的不良影响。一九五四年，由于经营管理不善，食品公司不但未能完成资金积累任务，反而有很大亏损；今年以来虽然部分地区有了一定的进步，但全国情况并未改变，这是不符合国家要求的。过去我们的政治工作薄弱，若干领导工作人员和职工对副食品经营的意义认识不足，有不安心工作和消极畏难的情绪，障碍了经营管理的改善。
    随着食品公司经营任务的扩大，如果不能迅速改变这种情况，是很难完成国家和人民所交付的任务的。因此，在食品公司系统全面开展劳动竞赛，提高全体职工的政治思想觉悟和经营管理水平，乃是一项十分迫切的任务。
    食品公司系统劳动竞赛的要求是：在正确贯彻政策的前提下，完成购销计划，做好收购和供应工作，改善经营管理，逐步作到活鲜商品不死、不臭、不烂；全国平均损耗率要求降到：生猪死亡率百分之零点七以下，活牛百分之零点一五，活羊百分之零点二五；并要求一定地区内和一定时间内长膘增肉。鲜蛋损耗率百分之三点五；水果腐烂率百分之四。并按既经批准的一九五五年费用计划水平争取降低商品纯流转额的百分之一，节约一亿八千万元的支出，以保证完成一九五五年利润上缴任务。
    从许多先进单位的实践证明，以上要求是可以做到的。如湖南省食品公司长沙第一仓库保管饲养的生猪，不但死亡率降到万分之八，而且在一年中全部存猪长肉增重达一百六十七万斤（毛重），除去饲养成本之外，还赚了三十八万七千元；河南省许昌食品公司创造长途运猪不死亡的经验；江苏省姜埝收购站由于实行“四员负责制”，生猪死亡率仅占万分之四点四八。这些都说明活鲜商品经营中虽有困难，但经过全体职工的努力，是完全可以克服的。
    怎样在食品公司系统开展增产节约劳动竞赛呢？在开展劳动竞赛工作中要抓哪几个环节呢？
    首先，在现有工作基础上，进一步整顿组织机构，健全工作制度，通过开展劳动竞赛，发动群众力量，推动机构和制度的建立和健全，同时又用健全的组织机构和工作制度来保证劳动竞赛的持久和巩固。中国食品公司自去年成立以来，全国的机构和人员有了很大发展，工作中也建立了一些必要的制度，并取得了一定的先进工作经验。这是开展增产节约劳动竞赛的有利条件。但自生猪实行派养派购以后，食品公司的工作任务更加复杂繁重，现有机构也不能完全适应工作发展的需要，尤其是兽医人员、会计人员、业务技术人员更为缺乏；为了改进工作，完成任务，保证增产节约劳动竞赛的顺利开展，应该有计划地加强这些人员的培养和配备，使各地机构逐步健全起来。但在组织机构的建设中必须认真贯彻精简节约整编机构的精神，反对盲目增设机构和浪费人力的现象。在整顿机构的同时，还须健全各种工作制度，特别是要逐步建立责任制度，奖惩制度，技术操作制度，商品检验制度，以便保证工作的正常进行。没有健全的机构和制度就很难全面地持久地开展劳动竞赛，但我们也决不能以机构和制度不健全为借口，消极地对待劳动竞赛的开展，要把两者结合起来，相互推动，相互发展。
    第二，加强政治思想教育，提高广大职工的社会主义觉悟，消灭工作中的无人负责现象。食品公司过去工作中虽然涌现出不少先进工作者，但也有不少单位，不少环节有严重的无人负责现象，如收购人员不管质量好坏，造成生猪大量掉称情况；运输人员不能很好照顾牲畜安全，保证商品质量；饲养人员不爱惜牲畜，喂养不当，卫生条件很差。这些现象严重地影响工作的提高。因此必须继续对全体职工进行充分的思想教育，说明商业工作在国家建设中的重要地位和作用，做好副食品收购和供应工作的重要意义等，提高职工社会主义觉悟，发挥工作中的积极性和主动性；提高全体职工的劳动热情，加强工作责任心，坚决消灭工作中一切不负责任的现象；以保证劳动竞赛的正常发展。
    第三，加强业务技术学习，提高各个经营管理环节中的科学技术水平，推广先进工作经验。食品公司所经营的商品多是鲜的或活的，在收购规格的鉴定、包装、运输、饲养、保管和加工生产的操作等环节上都需要有一定的技术，如果不能在技术上提高一步，使现有技术和经验符合科学的原理，就很容易发生事故，造成损失。这样不但对整个企业经营不利，造成经济上的重大损失，而且也直接关系到人民身体健康和牲畜疫病的传染，招致政治上的不良影响。因此，在开展增产节约劳动竞赛中，组织全体职工加强业务技术学习，提高科学和技术水平，是一项极其重要的工作。目前主要应发挥群众智慧，总结并推广先进的工作经验。如湖南食品公司长沙第一仓库生猪饲养管理方法，河南许昌食品公司火车运输生猪的饲养管理经验等都是经过实践证明和科学总结的，各地应该很好学习，认真推广。此外，还要善于向有经验的兽医人员，卫生人员，业务技术人员学习。
    第四、在整个企业领导上，应加强工作的计划性，提高社会主义商业的管理水平，反对资本主义的经营思想和主观主义、官僚主义的工作作风。社会主义商业的经营，是从国家和人民的利益出发的，是为生产和消费者的需要服务的，因此，必须正确贯彻政策，并依据整个国民经济的发展，加强计划管理，提高计划的准确性。只有如此，才能提高社会主义商业管理的水平。怎样才能加强计划性呢？最重要的是加强调查研究，按照客观规律，实事求是地制定计划，保证完成计划。其次是提高社会主义的经营思想，反对资本主义经营思想，必须要全体职工明确认识社会主义商业一切活动的目的是为了促进物资交流和生产发展，是为了逐步提高人民的物质和文化生活水平，是为了社会主义建设。其积累资金的办法是通过精打细算，厉行节约的道路去完成的。因此要特别强调正确执行政策；树立整体观念，反对本位主义；强调努力改善经营管理，积累资金，反对资本主义的单纯盈利观点。
    食品公司职工代表会议已经胜利结束了，各地商业行政部门要在各级党和政府的领导下，认真贯彻这次会议决议，发动全体职工全面地开展劳动竞赛，迅速改变食品公司经营管理不善的情况。
