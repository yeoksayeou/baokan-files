Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 11th: The newspapers of the German Democratic Republic on June 11th published a statement made by Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, to reporters from the German News Agency.

	Premier Grotewohl said: Regarding the Soviet government's note to the Federal Republic government, certain West German newspapers have exhausted all means to fabricate the attitude of the German Democratic Republic on this issue. But everyone knows that the German Democratic Republic is sparing no effort to seek a solution to the fundamental national task of the German people, namely, establishing a unified and democratic Germany. This is also in line with the interests of guaranteeing European peace. The German Democratic Republic has always believed that restoring normal relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany is in the interest of all the German people.

	The government of the German Democratic Republic received notification of the content of the note from the Soviet Ambassador to Germany and firmly supports this step by the Soviet government. The government of the German Democratic Republic is pleased to learn that West German public opinion and various political parties have expressed their approval of accepting the Soviet proposal. Therefore, the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the restoration of diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic will not only contribute to easing international tensions but also to understanding between the German people. Without the understanding of the German people themselves, the issue of establishing a unified, free, and democratic Germany cannot be resolved.

Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin, the German News Agency reported that Ulbricht, Deputy Premier of the German Democratic Republic, made a speech on the Soviet government's note to the West German government at the railway workers' festival celebration in Berlin on the 10th.

	He said: There are friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. However, the interests of easing international tensions require the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany. This would also create conditions for reunifying Germany into a peaceful, democratic country. Whether relations can be established between the governments of West Germany and the Soviet Union largely depends on the influence of peaceful forces in West Germany.

	Ulbricht then mentioned the ten specific proposals he made at the 24th plenary session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held on June 1st and 2nd regarding promoting rapprochement between the two parts of Germany. He pointed out: These proposals are in line with the aspirations of the West German working class and all democratic forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 11th: The Soviet government's note to the government of the German Federal Republic remains the focus of attention for the German public. Residents of both East and West Germany welcome the Soviet government's initiative and believe it is a major contribution to peace, easing international tensions, and peacefully resolving the German question.

	People from all walks of life in West Germany are demanding that the West German government accept the proposals put forward in the Soviet note. The Mayor of Munich, Wehmaier, expressed his support for accepting the Soviet government's proposals in his speech. He hopes that this will promote the realization of German unification.

	Guenther Klotz, the Mayor of Karlsruhe, advocated that Adenauer accept the Soviet invitation to discuss the German unification issue with the Soviet Union. He pointed out that Germany cannot achieve reunification without the Soviet Union.

	Professor Diem, a theology professor at the University of Tübingen, said: "I am pleased that Adenauer has been invited to visit Moscow, and I hope the Federal Chancellor will accept this invitation."

	Li Hai, the secretary of a trade union organization in Hamburg, welcomed the Soviet note, emphasizing that "refusing these proposals is equivalent to committing a crime."

	People from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic also warmly welcome the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in the note. Alfred Neumann, the First Secretary of the Berlin City Organization of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said at a meeting that the Soviet note is in line with the interests of peace and security and reflects the strength of the political and moral forces of the peace camp.

	Heinz Lassen, Chairman of the Frankfurt an der Oder organization of the German National Democratic Party, welcomed the Soviet note, saying that the German people all hope that Adenauer will go to Moscow.

	The famous German scientist and Chairman of the Greater Berlin Peace Committee, Professor Havemann, said: "I am convinced that all Germans in the East and West hope that the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic will begin negotiations as soon as possible."

	Erwin Wiegewell, the person in charge of the West German Committee for Promoting German Trade, used facts to illustrate that the Soviet proposal is in line with the economic interests of West Germany. He said that several months ago, five hundred West German companies signed a survey issued by his committee, expressing their hope to establish trade relations with the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 11th: Many newspapers in West Berlin and West Germany are calling on the West German government to accept the proposal to establish diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the German Federal Republic and are asking Adenauer to accept the Soviet invitation to go to Moscow.

	The "Telegraf" of West Berlin emphasized in its editorial that this Soviet invitation gives the Federal Government the opportunity to contribute to the cause of restoring German unity and easing world tensions. The newspaper believes that if Bonn does not accept this invitation, it will lose the opportunity to resolve the German question. The newspaper also pointed out that if Western countries oppose establishing this direct contact, it will show that they are attempting to use their rights in restoring German unity in a spirit that violates the will of all Germans.

	The editorial in the "Spandauer Volksblatt" pointed out that Adenauer's trip to Moscow "would in itself foreshadow a special prospect."

	The West German "Rheinische Post" (newspaper of the Christian Democratic Union) wrote in its commentary on the Soviet note: "There is no doubt that the normalization of (Soviet-German) mutual relations is necessary if the world is to be rescued from the dead end of the 'Cold War'."

	The "Hamburger Morgenpost," when discussing Adenauer's attitude toward the Soviet government's invitation to visit Moscow, said: "We ourselves answer this question: He should go." The newspaper emphasized that without reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union, restoring German unity is impossible. The newspaper said that we know that restoring unity cannot be an isolated political action. On the contrary, it can only be realized if it is seen as an active factor in a pan-European collective security system. The road to restoring unity is patient negotiation, not the threat of force.

	The "Industriekurier," a newspaper of industrialists in the Rhine and Ruhr region, emphasized on the 9th that the Soviet note has aroused widespread repercussions not only among politicians in Bonn but also among businessmen in West Germany. The newspaper expressed its hope to strengthen trade between the Soviet Union and West Germany and to establish mutual relations.

    格罗提渥总理和乌布利希副总理分别发表谈话
    支持苏联政府致西德政府的照会
    全德各界人民表示赞成接受苏联政府倡议
    新华社柏林十一日电　德意志民主共和国十一日报纸刊载了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥向德意志通讯社记者发表的谈话。
    格罗提渥总理说：关于苏联政府致联邦共和国政府照会一事，某些西德报纸用尽一切办法捏造德意志民主共和国对这个问题的态度。可是大家知道德意志民主共和国是不遗余力地寻求解决德国人民的根本的民族任务，即建立一个统一的民主的德国的。这也符合保障欧洲和平的利益。德意志民主共和国始终认为恢复苏联与德意志联邦共和国之间的正常关系是符合全德人民的利益的。
    德意志民主共和国政府曾经接到苏联驻德大使的通知而得悉照会的内容并且坚决支持苏联政府的这个步骤。德意志民主共和国政府满意地获悉西德舆论及各政党都表明赞成接受苏联的建议。因此，德意志民主共和国政府认为恢复苏联与联邦共和国之间的外交、经济与文化关系，不仅对于缓和国际紧张局势，而且对于德国人民间的谅解将能作出贡献。如果没有德国人民本身的谅解，建立一个统一的自由的民主的德国的问题是不能获得解决的。
    新华社十一日讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志通讯社报道，德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希十日在柏林的铁路员工节庆祝大会上就苏联政府致西德政府的照会发表谈话。
    他说：在苏联和德意志民主共和国之间存在着友好关系。但是，缓和国际紧张局势的利益要求在苏联和西德之间建立外交关系。这样还可以为把德国重新统一成为一个和平、民主的国家创造条件。西德和苏联的政府之间是否能建立关系，在很大程度上取决于西德和平力量的影响。
    乌布利希接着提到他在今年六月一日和二日举行的德国统一社会党中央委员会第二十四次全体会议上就促进德国两部分的接近问题所提出的十点具体建议，他指出：这些建议是符合于西德工人阶级和全体民主力量的愿望的。
    新华社柏林十一日电　苏联政府致德意志联邦共和国政府的照会仍然是德国公众注意的中心。东西德的居民都欢迎苏联政府的倡议，并且认为这是对和平、对缓和国际紧张局势和和平解决德国问题的一项重大贡献。
    西德各阶层人民都要求西德政府接受苏联照会中提出的建议。慕尼黑市市长韦麦在发言中赞成接受苏联政府的建议。他希望这会促进德国统一的实现。
    加尔斯卢合市市长根特·克洛茨主张阿登纳接受苏联的邀请，以便同苏联讨论德国统一问题。他指出，撇开苏联，德国是无法实现重新统一的。
    图宾根大学神学教授迪姆说：“我对阿登纳被邀访问莫斯科感到高兴，我希望联邦总理会接受这一邀请。”
    汉堡的一个工会组织的书记李海欢迎苏联的照会，他强调说：“拒绝这些建议等于是犯罪。”
    德意志民主共和国各界人士也热烈欢迎苏联在照会中提出的建议。德国统一社会党柏林市组织第一书记艾尔弗雷德·诺曼在一次会议上说，苏联的照会符合和平与安全的利益，并且反映了和平阵营的政治和道义力量的强大。
    德国国家民主党奥得河畔法兰克福组织主席海恩茨·拉森欢迎苏联的照会，他说，德国人民都希望阿登纳到莫斯科去。
    著名的德国科学家、大柏林和平委员会主席哈佛曼教授说：“我深信，东部和西部的全体德国人都希望苏联和联邦共和国尽早开始谈判。”
    西德促进德国贸易委员会负责人欧尔文·威格威尔特以事实说明了苏联的建议是符合西德的经济利益的。他说，几个月以前，有五百家西德的公司在他的委员会发出的一份调查书上签名，表示希望同苏联建立贸易关系。
    新华社柏林十一日电　西柏林和西德的许多报纸都要求西德政府接受关于建立苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的外交关系的建议，要求阿登纳接受苏联的邀请到莫斯科去。
    西柏林的“电讯报”在社论中着重指出，苏联这次邀请使联邦政府有机会对恢复德国统一的事业和缓和世界紧张局势作出贡献。这家报纸认为，波恩如果不接受这一邀请它就会丧失解决德国问题的机会。这家报纸并且指出，西方国家如果反对建立这种直接的接触就会表明，他们企图以违背全体德国人的意志的精神来在恢复德国统一问题上利用自己的权利。
    “斯班都人民报”的社论指出，阿登纳总理到莫斯科去“这件事情本身就将预示特别的远景”。
    西德“莱因邮报”（基督教民主联盟的报纸）在评论苏联照会时写道：“毫无疑问，（苏德）相互关系的正常化是需要的，如果要把世界从‘冷战’的绝路中拯救出来的话。”
    “汉堡晨邮报”在谈到阿登纳对苏联政府邀请访问莫斯科的态度问题时说道：“我们自己回答这个问题：他应当去。”这家报纸着重指出，不同苏联达成协议，恢复德国统一是不可能的。报纸说，我们知道，恢复统一不可能是一个孤立的政治行动，相反地，只有把它看作全欧集体安全体系的一个积极因素，它才能实现。恢复统一的道路是耐心的谈判，而不是武力的威胁。
    莱因和鲁尔地区工业家的报纸“工业快报”九日强调指出，苏联照会不仅在波恩的政治家中间，而且在西德的商人中都引起了广泛的反响。这家报纸表示希望加强苏联和西德之间的贸易和建立相互之间的关系。
