Building Shafts Without Exploration Leads to Huge Waste

To the Editor:

    The Zhonggang "Shaft" of the Jiaohe Coal Mine began construction in August 1952. After more than a year of selfless labor by the excavating workers, it was completed in November 1953. However, a long time has passed, and not only has this shaft not been put into production, but it is about to be scrapped!

    What is the reason for this? It turns out that before building the shaft, the leaders of the Jiaohe Coal Mine did not conduct a serious survey of the reserves of the coalfield in the Zhonggang area. Only after the shaft was built did they discover that the amount of coal in the Zhonggang area was not abundant. The existing four wellheads could extract all the coal in a few years. If this newly built shaft is used, it will not only extract very little coal, but also shorten the lifespan of the existing wellheads.

    The fact that this large-scale shaft was scrapped after completion has caused the following losses to the country: wasted more than one million yuan in shaft construction costs; stockpiled surplus equipment worth approximately 120,000 yuan; paid 10,000 yuan in storage fees in 1954 alone, and currently has to spend 300 yuan per month on maintenance. This loss is equivalent to more than 100,000 tons of raw coal.

### 不经勘探就建筑竖井造成巨大浪费

    不经勘探就建筑竖井造成巨大浪费编辑同志：
    蛟河煤矿中岗“竖井”在一九五二年八月开始兴建，经过掘凿工人们一年多时间的忘我劳动，在一九五三年十一月就落成了。可是，时间过了很久，这个竖井不但没有投入生产，却要报废了！
    这是什么原因呢？原来在建立竖井之前，蛟河煤矿的领导方面对于中岗地区煤田的埋藏量并没有进行认真的勘察。建好了井，才发现中岗地区的煤量并不丰富，只用现有的四处井口采掘，几年就会全部采掘出来。如果使用这座新建的竖井，不但只能采出很少的煤，并且会缩短现有的几个井口的寿命。
    这座规模庞大的竖井建成后就报废了，给国家造成的损失是：浪费了井筒修建费一百多万元；积压了剩余器材约十二万元，一九五四年一年又支付了一万元的保管费，目前每月还得花三百元的维持费。这笔损失，折合原煤十万吨以上。  秋颉
