Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Electric Dispatch. The Public Security Department of Guizhou Province held the first Conference of Public Security Heroes and Model Representatives from June 8th to 13th.

	This conference exchanged experiences in the struggle against the enemy, commended heroes and models on the people's public security front, and elected seventeen representatives to attend the National People's Police and Public Security Committee Members' Conference of Heroes and Model Representatives.
	In recent years, 786 heroes and models have emerged in the public security organs of Guizhou Province. A total of 347 representatives of heroes and models and representatives of public security models from the people attended this conference. Among these model figures, there is Cao Mingcheng, a first-class model who is brave and resourceful and traveled back and forth in the mountains to capture more than 70 bandit leaders; Han Congshan, a first-class meritorious person who bravely disregarded his own safety and jumped into the flood three times to rescue nine people; and Wei Rongcai (Bouyei ethnic group), a people's economic policeman who actively protects the safety of construction sites, stands guard and patrols day and night, and has successively solved six theft cases. In 1954, when Wei Rongcai was working at a construction site, a flash flood broke out after heavy rain. He mobilized four to five hundred workers despite his illness to go into the water and rescue property worth several thousand yuan.
	Among the representatives of public security models from the masses, there is Zhou Yuhua, a female Communist Party member and public security model from a street in Zunyi City, who assisted the government in solving eleven cases and fought bare-handed one night with a habitual thief, Liu Huarong, who had escaped from a labor reform unit, and finally arrested the criminal; there is also Xu Yiyou (Miao peasant), a public security committee member of Bai Ru Township, Ping Tang County, who promptly exposed the counter-revolutionary element He Xuecai who had infiltrated the Shangba Agricultural Production Cooperative to carry out sabotage activities, making the cooperative more consolidated.

    贵州省召开首届公安功臣模范代表会议
    新华社贵阳电　贵州省公安厅在六月八日到十三日举行了首届公安功臣模范代表会议。
    这次会议交流了对敌斗争的经验，表扬了人民公安战线上的功臣模范，并选举了出席全国人民警察和治安保卫委员会委员功臣模范代表大会的代表十七人。
    几年来，贵州省公安机关中，共涌现出七百八十六个功臣模范。出席这次会议的功臣模范代表和人民群众治安模范代表共三百四十七人。在这些模范人物中，有英勇机智、往返山区捕到匪首七十多名的一等模范曹明成；有奋不顾身、三次跳入洪水中抢救出九人的一等功臣韩从善；有积极保卫工地安全、不分日夜站岗巡查、先后破获了盗窃案件六起的人民经济警察韦荣才（布依族）。一九五四年，韦荣才在某工地工作时，大雨后山洪暴发，他带病动员四、五百名职工下水抢救出价值数千元的财产。
    在群众治安模范代表中，有遵义市街道治安模范、女共产党员周玉华，她协助政府破获案件十一起，并在一天晚上空手和一个在劳动改造单位中逃跑的惯盗刘华荣搏斗，终于把罪犯逮捕起来；还有平塘县摆茹乡治安保卫委员徐益友（苗族农民），他及时揭发了混入上坝农业生产合作社进行破坏活动的反革命分子何学才，使合作社更加巩固起来。
