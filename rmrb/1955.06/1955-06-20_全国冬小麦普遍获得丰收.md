Xinhua News Agency, 18th. This year's winter wheat harvest is good across the country, and many regions have completed or exceeded their original production plans. Henan Province, whose winter wheat area accounts for more than one-fifth of the country's total, may exceed the plan by 2 percent in output. Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang and other provinces suffered from severe floods last year, and this year these provinces have all striven for a bumper winter wheat harvest. Among them, Anhui Province has expanded the planting area of winter wheat by promoting agricultural production reform; the province's output may exceed the plan by 18.3 percent, an increase of 12.2 percent over last year. Sichuan Province exceeded the plan by 6.5 percent, an increase of 12.9 percent over last year. Shanxi Province can complete the plan, an increase of 4 percent over last year. Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, Yunnan and other provinces can complete the plan. In addition, Shandong, Shaanxi, Hebei, Jiangsu and other provinces have reduced production due to drought, but some areas in these provinces have still increased production. For example, Heze Prefecture in Shandong Province exceeded the plan by 2 percent, an increase of more than 18 million jin over last year. The average yield per mu in Tongxian and Handan prefectures in Hebei Province exceeded the plan by 5 percent and 3 percent respectively, an increase of 11 jin and 5 jin over last year.
    Now, the winter wheat in the provinces in the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins has been harvested one after another, and the provinces in the Yellow River and Huai River basins are still harvesting intensely and will soon be completed.

    全国冬小麦普遍获得丰收
    新华社十八日讯　今年全国冬小麦收成良好，许多地区完成或超额完成了原定的生产计划。冬小麦面积占全国五分之一以上的河南省，产量可超过计划百分之二。安徽、湖北、湖南、浙江等省去年曾有一部分地区遭受大水，今年这些省都争得了冬小麦丰收。其中安徽省由于推行农业生产改革，扩大了冬小麦的种植面积；全省产量可超过计划百分之十八点三，比去年增加百分之十二点二。四川省超过计划百分之六点五，比去年增加百分之十二点九。山西省可以完成计划，比去年增加百分之四。江西、广东、贵州、云南等省能完成计划。此外，山东、陕西、河北、江苏等省因旱减产，但这些省内仍有一部分地区增产。如山东省菏泽专区超过计划百分之二，比去年多收一千八百多万斤。河北省通县、邯郸两专区每亩平均产量分别超过计划百分之五和百分之三，比去年多收十一斤和五斤。
    现在，长江、珠江流域各省的冬小麦已先后收完，黄河、淮河流域各省还在紧张收割，很快就可结束。
