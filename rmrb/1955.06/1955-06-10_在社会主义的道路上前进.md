    Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant Manufactures a New Type of Machine Tool
    The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, a massive machine tool manufacturing plant currently under reconstruction, now has eight major workshops in production. The long-awaited new product, a universal lathe, has been successfully trial-produced by this plant. From 3:00 PM on May 31st, the newly manufactured universal lathe underwent heavy cutting and precision cutting tests. After seven days of trial operation, the situation is good. This new product will soon begin mass production.
    This lathe is currently one of the most precise and efficient machine tools. It has a wide range of uses and can turn flat surfaces, circular surfaces, inclined surfaces, screws, inner diameters, and drill holes, achieving high precision and gloss. (Guo Qingmian, Li Yuxue)

    Aerial Magnetic Survey Conducted on the Grasslands of Inner Mongolia
    A team jointly formed by the Ministry of Geology and the Civil Aviation Administration of China has begun conducting an aerial magnetic survey on a grassland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. To maximize the use of the calmest air currents at dawn each day, the aerial magnetic survey personnel begin their preparations late at night; the surveyors also set up ground indicators for aerial surveying in advance, allowing the aerial survey work to proceed quickly.
    This aerial magnetic survey team will complete a large-scale aerial magnetic survey on this grassland this year, identifying the largest ultramafic rock mass discovered in China. This work, first conducted through aerial magnetic surveying and then through detailed measurements by a ground geophysical exploration team, will quickly provide reliable data for the geological staff currently exploring this mining area.

    Asphalt Pavement for the Highway Between Zhangye and Yumen Oil Mine
    The 312-kilometer highway from Zhangye to Jiuquan and from Jiuquan to the Yumen Oil Mine area on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Highway has begun to be paved with asphalt. This project has already commenced in sections in Zhangye, Gaotai, and Jiuquan at the end of May. Fifteen kilometers of road surface have already been paved, and it is expected that all paving will be completed by the end of September.
    The highway originally had mostly gravel pavement. Due to the heavy transportation tasks and excessive load on the road surface, the roadbed was severely compacted and uneven, causing significant jolting for vehicles and seriously affecting the lifespan of vehicle parts and tires. At the same time, the dust from the road surface obscured the drivers' vision, and traffic accidents occurred frequently. This time, the state allocated over 980,000 yuan to mobilize a large number of laborers to pave the asphalt surface. After the asphalt surface is laid, these problems can be solved, the driving speed can be increased by 5 kilometers per hour, and the vehicle turnover rate can be increased by 1.8%. This will greatly contribute to the smooth transportation of petroleum from Yumen to the east and accelerate the construction of the Yumen Oil Mine. In addition, the maintenance cost of this road surface can also be reduced by more than 70,000 yuan per year. (Our Correspondent in Lanzhou)

    Major Portion of Xi'an Central Shaft Completed
    The workers constructing the Xi'an Central Shaft in Jilin Province have completed 77% of the total project volume after four years and six months of hard work. This modern coal mining shaft will be completed and put into production this year. Currently, the above-ground civil engineering and installation works have entered the final stage, and most of the installation work has been transferred to underground operations. Huge ventilators, boilers, winches, belt conveyors, and coal preparation machines will soon be test-run successively.
    The shaft construction workers are launching a labor emulation campaign to ensure that the shaft is handed over for production this year. Not long ago, the workers installing the auxiliary shaft cage guide rails implemented two important suggestions made by Soviet experts and put forward more than ten rationalization proposals themselves, which shortened the installation time of the entire auxiliary shaft cage guide rails by half compared to the previous installation time of the main shaft cage guide rails. The electrical workers installing the wellbore cables have continuously studied technology, increasing the efficiency of cable laying sixfold. The installation of compressed air iron pipes in the underground roadways was originally planned to take 72 hours, but actually took only 8 hours.
    The production process of the Xi'an Central Shaft will be highly mechanized. When the construction of the shaft began, the Xi'an Mining Bureau entrusted brother coal mines to assist in training a group of workers skilled in modern technology. Now, a large number of combine drivers, winch drivers, and coal cutter operators are repeatedly practicing to improve their skills. The Xi'an Mining Bureau is also continuing to select and train technical workers who can operate other new equipment from the existing production pits. Some production management personnel and technical workers who went to the Soviet Union for internships have also returned successively.

    Crops Growing Well at Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station
    Various crops being test-planted this year at the Lhasa "July 1st" Agricultural Experiment Station are growing well. Winter wheat, which was vernalized and sown fifty days ago, has begun to tiller. Sichuan pickled mustard tubers are growing strong rootstocks on the plateau soil. The watermelon seedlings, which were first grafted onto the pumpkin stems, have sprouted new leaves. Rape, which has been test-planted for two years, has proven to be well-suited for growth on the plateau. According to small-area extrapolations, it can produce more than 500 jin per mu. The five improved varieties of rape that the experiment station is testing for comparison this year have all grown to five or six inches high, and some have opened yellow flowers. In the improved seed breeding area, the robust wheat seedlings of Wugong Spring Wheat and Chabei Oats are jointing. Dozens of varieties of winter wheat are all flowering and heading. Corn, millet, tobacco, and hemp have grown to three or four inches high. Pumpkins in the hotbeds weigh three or four jin each.
    Two hundred apple saplings planted in the nursery this spring have sprouted tender green branches. Over 95% of the more than 100,000 planted poplar and willow trees have survived, adorning the experiment station with a verdant green.
    Currently, the staff of the experiment station are grafting cantaloupe onto pumpkin stems and building trellises for tomatoes and cucumbers. Tibetan farmers near the farm often come to the experiment station to visit. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Youyi Farm Nearing Completion of Reclamation Plan
    As of June 7th, the state-owned Youyi Farm had reclaimed 19,236 hectares of wasteland, completing 87.5% of this year's reclamation plan.
    On the afternoon of June 7th, the state-owned Youyi Farm held a flag-awarding ceremony for the second phase of the land reclamation competition. The Fifth Branch Farm, which completed the reclamation of 5,106 hectares of land thirteen days ahead of schedule at 9:00 AM that day, and the Twelfth Production Team of this branch farm both received the rotating red flag.
    In the first phase of the land reclamation competition, although the quality of the Fifth Branch Farm was relatively good, its reclamation progress fell behind other branch farms. All the employees of the branch farm were determined to catch up with other branch farms while ensuring quality. They promoted the experience of the Eleventh Production Team's leadership competition and adopted the methods proposed by the Soviet advisor of the branch farm, reducing the idle time of tractors and improving work efficiency. In fifteen days, almost every locomotive exceeded its work quota in every shift. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Awati Uygur Farmers Build Shelterbelts
    Uygur farmers in Awati County, on the edge of the Tarim Desert, have gradually built up a shelterbelt.
    Since 1952, Uygur farmers in Awati County have collectively built shelterbelts in more than a dozen locations near the edge of the desert, such as Sike Bridge and Laiyi Dang. They have now planted nearly 700,000 trees, including Lombardy poplars, willows, and Elaeagnus angustifolia, covering a shelterbelt area of 1,680 mu. This spring, in addition to planting more than 15,000 scattered trees, the farmers in the Second District collectively built 75 mu of windbreak forests. Kuwanmu Hesuti, a second-class provincial forestry labor model in Xinjiang Province, has led the farmers of Laiyi Dang to build 225 mu of windbreak forests over the years.
    A state-owned nursery established in Awati County in 1954 has begun to cultivate a large number of Lombardy poplars, peach, apricot, walnut, and sour plum saplings to supply the needs of the masses for afforestation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在社会主义的道路上前进
    沈阳第一机床厂制成一种新型工作母机
    正在改建中的规模巨大的工作母机制造厂——沈阳第一机床厂，现在已经有八个主要车间投入生产。人们盼望已久的一种新产品万能车床已经由这个厂试制成功。从五月三十一日下午三时起，新制成的万能车床进行了重切削和精密切削试验。经过七天试车，情况良好。这种新产品不久将开始大量生产。
    这种车床是目前精密度和效能最高的一种工作母机。它的用途很广，可以车削平面、圆面、斜面、螺丝、内径和钻孔等，并能达到很高的精密度和光泽度。  （郭庆绵、李裕学）
    内蒙古草原上进行航空磁测
    地质部和中国民用航空局联合组成的一支航空磁测普查队已开始在内蒙古自治区一个草原上进行航空磁测。为了最大地利用每天黎明时最平稳的气流，航空磁测人员在深夜就开始了准备工作；测量人员也提前布置好航测的地面指标，使航测工作进行得很快。
    这一支航空磁测普查队，今年要在这块草原上完成一项大面积的航空磁测普查工作，圈定我国所发现的一块最大的超基性岩体。这一工作，先经航空磁测，然后经过地面物探队的详测，就可为现在正在勘探这一矿区的地质工作人员迅速提供可靠的资料。　（新华社）
    张掖玉门油矿间公路铺沥青面
    兰新公路的张掖到酒泉段和从酒泉到玉门油矿区全长共三百一十二公里的公路开始铺筑沥青面。这项工程已经于五月底在张掖、高台、酒泉各段分别开工。现在已经铺筑路面十五公里，预计九月底可以全部铺筑完毕。
    这段公路原来大部分是砂砾性路面，由于运输任务繁重，路面负载力过大，路基被压得坎坷不平，汽车行驶颠簸很大，严重影响了车辆的机件和轮胎的使用时间。同时，由于路面尘土飞扬，遮蔽了驾驶员的视线，行车事故时常发生。这次国家拨出九十八万多元的款子，动员大批民工等铺筑沥青面。沥青面铺好以后，这些问题可以解决，行车速度每小时也可以提高五公里，车辆周转率可提高百分之一点八。这对玉门石油顺利东运和加速玉门油矿建设将起很大作用。另外，这段路面的养护成本每年也可以降低七万多元。　（本报驻兰州记者）
    西安中央竖井大部工程完工
    建设吉林省西安中央竖井的工人们，经过四年六个月的辛勤的劳动，已经完成竖井总工程量的百分之七十七。今年，这对现代化采煤竖井就将完工投入生产。现在，地面上的土木建筑工程和安装工程都已进入收尾阶段，大部分安装工程已经转入在地下进行。巨大的扇风机、锅炉、绞车、皮带运输机和选煤机等设备，不久即将陆续试车。
    建井工人正为保证竖井在今年移交生产展开劳动竞赛。不久以前，安装副井罐道的工人执行了苏联专家提出的两项重要的建议，自己提出了十多件合理化建议，使整个副井罐道安装时间比以前主井罐道安装时间缩短了一半。正在安设井筒电缆的电气工人，由于不断钻研技术，使放电缆的工作效率提高了六倍。在井下巷道中安装压风铁管子，原来计划用七十二小时，实际上用了八小时。
    西安中央竖井的生产过程将是高度机械化的。在开始建设竖井的时候，西安矿务局就委托兄弟煤矿协助培养一批掌握现代化技术的工人。现在大批康拜因司机、绞车司机和截煤机手正在反复练习，提高技术。西安矿务局现在还正在原有生产坑口继续选拔和培养操纵其他新设备的技术工人。到苏联实习的一部分生产管理人员和技术工人也已经陆续回来。（本报集体通讯员吉林日报编辑部）
    拉萨农业试验场作物长得好
    拉萨“七·一”农业试验场今年试种的各种作物生长良好。五十天前播下的经过春化处理的冬小麦，开始分枝。四川的榨菜，在高原的土地上长起了壮大的根茎。最先嫁接在南瓜茎上的西瓜苗，已吐出了新叶。经过两年试种的油菜，证明很适合于在高原上生长，根据小面积推算，每亩可产五百多斤。今年试验场为了比较而试种的五种良种品种的油菜都长到五、六寸高，有的开放了黄花。在良种繁殖区里，武功春小麦和察北燕麦茁壮的麦苗正在拔节。几十个品种的冬小麦都在扬花吐穗。玉米、谷子、烟草和大麻等长到三、四寸高。温床里的南瓜已有三、四斤重。
    今春栽在苗圃里的二百株苹果幼树，已抽出嫩绿枝条。栽植的十万多株杨树和柳树，百分之九十五都成活了，把试验场点缀成一片翠绿。
    目前试验场的工作人员正在南瓜茎上嫁接甜瓜，给蕃茄、黄瓜搭架。农场附近的藏族农民常到试验场来参观。　（新华社）
    友谊农场开荒计划即将完成
    截至六月七日，国营友谊农场已经开垦出了一万九千二百三十六公顷荒地，完成今年开荒计划的百分之八十七点五。
    七日下午，国营友谊农场举行了第二阶段开荒竞赛授旗大会。在当天上午九点钟提前十三天完成开荒五千一百零六公顷的第五分场和这个分场的第十二生产队都得到了流动红旗。
    第五分场在第一阶段的开荒竞赛中，虽然质量比较好，但是开荒进度落在其他分场的后面。分场全体职工决心在保证质量的基础上赶上其他分场。他们推行了第十一生产队领导竞赛的经验，还采纳了分场苏联顾问提出的办法，减少了拖拉机的空转时间，提高了工作效率。十五天中，差不多是每一个机车每班次都超过工作定额。　（新华社）
    阿瓦提维族农民营造防护林
    塔里木大沙漠边缘阿瓦提县的维吾尔族农民，已逐渐营造起一道防护林带。
    阿瓦提县的维吾尔族农民，从一九五二年便开始在靠近沙漠边缘的司的克桥、来依档等十几处地方集体营造防护林带。现在他们已栽植了钻天杨、柳、沙枣等树将近七十万株，林带面积已有一千六百八十亩。今年春天，二区农民除了零星植树一万五千多株外，还集体营造防风林七十五亩。新疆省二等林业劳动模范库万穆合苏提，几年来带动来依档农民营造的防风林已有二百二十五亩。
    阿瓦提县一九五四年建立的一处国营苗圃，今年已开始培育大量钻天杨和桃、杏、核桃、酸梅等树苗，供应群众造林需要。　（新华社）
