In the total cost of construction projects, labor costs generally account for 15% to 20%, second only to materials and transportation costs. However, many construction units do not pay attention to savings in this area, and intolerable waste of labor continues to occur. In 1954, the original North China Directly Subordinate Fifth Construction Engineering Company had more than one-third of its workers idle for more than half a year. At the end of the year, statistics showed that idle work totaled 225,417 workdays. In addition, 156,373 workdays were spent using skilled workers as unskilled laborers. Wages alone resulted in a loss of more than 564,780 yuan. The annual surplus of such a large company was not enough to offset this idle work expense.

In fact, this is just the waste of one unit. If we calculate the waste caused by idle work in all units over the past few years, it is even more alarming. The Beijing Labor Bureau once made a statistic based on the idle work figures reported by thirteen construction units in Beijing in 1953 (the actual idle work figures were much higher than this), totaling more than 1,364,000 workdays. In the same year, the actual construction days in Beijing were about 200 days, which is equivalent to more than 6,800 workers having nothing to do for a year. If these people were put into production, according to the average daily output value of construction workers in Beijing that year, which was 15 yuan, they would create 20.46 million yuan of wealth for the country. In addition, the state would have to pay a large amount of wages, calculated at an average of 2 yuan per workday, wasting another 2,728,000 yuan. If this money were used to build standard dormitories for employees (the cost per square meter is at most 80 yuan), 290,000 square meters could be built. Based on an average of 20 square meters per household, housing could be built for 14,500 households, which could accommodate 58,000 people, assuming four people per household. If this amount were used to build factories and put them into production, the value created would be difficult to calculate.

In 1954, the phenomenon of idle work still existed. The original East China Administrative Committee Construction Engineering Bureau and other three units idled 11,952 workdays in June, the peak construction season. Even the Northeast region, which had the earliest job allocation and a better foundation, idled more than 41,000 workdays in the second quarter of 1954.

In 1955, this situation still had not improved. Taking several companies under the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering as an example, although a trend of idle work had long been evident, and they had also received an urgent telegram from the North China Engineering Management Bureau regarding "immediately strengthening the organization and allocation balance of labor and vigorously changing the trend of possible idle work," they did not take emergency measures. The first and second companies under this bureau had idled about 2,000 workers before March 13. At that time, the wood and iron processing plants needed workers, but they did not lend them out. The second company had not fully determined its tasks, but had already idled a large number of workers and asked the labor bureau for 500 laborers.

Due to the serious waste of idle work, some construction units, although they completed and overfulfilled their tasks, ended up in heavy debt at the end of the year.

The main reason for this serious waste of labor in construction units is that when preparing labor demand plans, they generally adopt the method of "keeping long hair." That is, the plan is made larger, and they are accustomed to using excessive labor to complete tasks. Some construction units, although they idle a large number of workers, still believe: "It doesn't matter if we idle some, we won't be in a hurry when the task comes." When labor-demanding units borrow workers from idle units, the idle units are unwilling to lend them, even saying: "Not lending workers is a concrete manifestation of careful calculation. If we lend our workers to help others complete tasks, we will have to pay out of our own pocket" (labor-demanding units generally borrow low-level workers or laborers. If the idle unit has skilled workers, the wage difference is borne by the idle unit itself). This kind of "rather idle than short, and not lending even when idle," which only cares about oneself and disregards others, only sees the partial and not the whole, is a very wrong departmentalist idea.

This erroneous thinking not only wastes national resources and squanders valuable labor, but also promotes the blind development and expansion of the entire construction team. In particular, the number of ordinary workers in the bricklaying and carpentry trades is developing faster, exceeding the speed required by national construction. According to statistics from the North China Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, based on the tasks completed in 1954 and all types of work, the number of bricklayers exceeded the actual need by more than 50%, while the actual number of plumbing, electrical, and sanitation workers accounted for only 48% of the required number.

Idle work also affects workers' income. Especially bricklayers and carpenters, due to frequently being idle or doing backbreaking work (skilled workers doing unskilled labor), are directly affected in terms of income and the improvement of technical skills. If a bricklayer is idle for one month each year, although he can receive 60% to 70% of his original standard wage as a subsidy, his total annual income will be reduced by 2.5% to 3.4%.

Can the problem of idle work be solved? According to the experience of various places, due to the large changes in construction tasks, designs not keeping up with construction, and unreasonable distribution of work types, it is certainly difficult to completely avoid idle work. However, if we overcome departmentalist thinking and put the overall interests of the country first, we can reduce or eliminate idle work. For example, the original North China Directly Subordinate Fourth Construction Engineering Company basically did not start construction before June 1954, but actively contacted various construction units and lent out a total of 4,287 workers, equivalent to 117,414 workdays. Although they subsidized some wage differences, they still saved the country more than 240,000 yuan. More importantly, they supported national infrastructure. Calculated at about five workdays per cubic meter of general mixed structure in the company in 1954, these workers lent out built an additional 24,000 cubic meters of buildings for the country.

    重视节约人力
    温建新　汪圻
    在建筑工程总造价中，人工成本一般要占百分之十五至二十，仅次于材料和运输费。但是，许多建筑工程单位不重视这方面的节约，在劳动力的使用上不断发生令人难以容忍的浪费。一九五四年原华北直属第五建筑工程公司，有三分之一以上的工人在半年多的时期中无工可做，年底统计了一下，窝工共达二十二万五千四百十七个工作日，加上以技工代壮工用了十五万六千三百七十三个工作日，仅工资一项就损失了五十六万四千七百八十多元。这样大的公司一年的盈余还不够抵补这笔窝工的费用。
    其实这仅是一个单位的浪费，如果把所有单位在这几年的窝工浪费计算一下，是更惊人的。北京市劳动局曾根据北京市十三个建筑单位在一九五三年自报的窝工数字作了一个统计（实际窝工数字大大超过此数），共窝了一百三十六万四千多工。同年，北京市一年实际施工日期约二百日，这就等于六千八百多个工人一年无事可做。如果这些人投入生产，按当年北京市建筑工人日产值平均十五元计算，就会给国家创造二千零四十六万元的财富。另外，国家还要支出大量工资，以每工平均二元计算，又浪费了二百七十二万八千多元。如果用这笔钱盖成职工标准宿舍（每平方公尺造价最多八十元），可盖二十九万平方公尺，按每户平均二十平方公尺计算，可建筑一万四千五百户的住房，每户以四口人计算，可供五万八千人居住。如果用这笔款盖厂房并投入生产，能创造的价值就很难计算了。
    一九五四年窝工现象依然存在。原华东行政委员会建筑工程局等三个单位在施工旺季的六月份内，就窝了一万一千九百五十二个工。连调配工作最早、基础较好的东北区，在一九五四年第二季度也窝了四万一千多工。
    一九五五年这种状况仍然没有好转，以建筑工程部华北太原工程局所属的几个公司为例，虽然早已呈现窝工的趋势，同时也早接到华北工程管理总局关于“立即加强劳动力的组织调配平衡工作，大力改变可能发生窝工的趋势”的紧急电报，但并未采取紧急措施。这个局所属的第一、二公司，在三月十三日前已窝着约二千名工人，当时木、铁加工厂正需要工人，但他们不借给。第二公司任务还未完全确定，已经窝着大批工人，还向劳动局要五百名壮工。
    由于窝工浪费严重，有些建筑单位虽然完成和超额完成了任务，但年终一算账却亏累不堪。
    建筑单位所以会发生这种严重浪费劳动力的现象，主要原因是编制需工计划时，一般都采取
  “留长发”的办法。就是把计划订得大些；完成任务习惯于使用过多的劳动力。某些建筑单位虽然窝着大批工人，但还认为：“窝点没啥，任务来了省得着急。”当需工单位向窝工单位借工时，窝工单位也不愿借，甚至说：“不借工是精打细算的具体表现，借了我们的工人，替别人完成任务，我们还要贴钱”（需工单位一般都是借低级工或壮工，窝工单位如窝着技工时，其工资差额由窝工单位自己负担）。这种“宁窝勿缺，窝也不借”只顾自己，不顾别人，只见局部，不见整体的本位主义思想，是非常错误的。
    这种错误思想不仅浪费了国家资财，糟塌了宝贵的劳动力，也促使整个建筑队伍盲目地发展扩大。尤其是普通工人中的瓦、木工种发展更快，超过了国家建设需要的速度。根据建筑工程部华北工程管理总局的统计，以一九五四年完成的任务和所有的工种计算，瓦工超出实际需要百分之五十以上，但在水暖、电气、卫生工种中实有人数仅占需要数的百分之四十八。
    窝工还影响工人的收入，尤其是瓦、木工由于超过需要经常窝工或背工（技工当壮工），直接影响收入和技术水平的提高。一个瓦工如果每年窝工一个月，虽然可领到原标准工资百分之六十至七十的津贴，但全年合计要少收入百分之二点五至三点四。
    窝工问题是否可以解决呢？根据各地的经验证明，由于建筑业任务变动大，设计赶不上施工，工种分布不合理，完全避免窝工是有一定困难的，但如果克服本位主义思想，把国家整体利益放在第一位，是可以少窝工或不窝工的。如原华北直属第四工程公司在一九五四年六月份以前基本未开工，但积极向各开工单位联系，借出工人共达四千二百八十七人，折合十一万七千四百一十四个工作日，虽然贴补了些工资差额，但还给国家节约了二十四万多元的资金。更重要的是支持了国家基本建设，按一九五四年这个公司一般混合结构每立方公尺需工五个左右计算，借出的这批工人共给国家多盖了二万四千立方公尺的建筑物。
