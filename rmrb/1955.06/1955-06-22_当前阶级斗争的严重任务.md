    The Serious Task of the Current Class Struggle
    Meng Chao

    After the "People's Daily" exposed the first and second batches of materials regarding the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, the broad masses of people across the country angrily pointed fingers and asked: "What is their political background?" "Who are their masters?" Because the eyes of the people are discerning, whoever reads the first and second batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary conspiracy will not believe that they have no political background and no backstage bosses.

    Now the "People's Daily" has exposed the third batch of materials, which is to dig out their old roots. This group of scum, waving the banner of progressive literature and art, are the ugly and unbearable running dogs of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The "subjective fighting spirit" they flaunt is extending bloody and sinful hands, vainly attempting to subvert the cause of the Chinese people's revolution, and working hard for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

    Before the national liberation, the Chinese people suffered the poison and persecution of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and secret agents for many years. After liberation, Chiang Kai-shek still occupies Taiwan, and colludes with US imperialism, constantly disrupting us. On the other hand, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group—the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "special detachment" for harassment—also echoed remotely, exhausting all kinds of destructive tricks to find loopholes, exploit opportunities, and sow discord; to the point of blatant, openly proposing counter-revolutionary "opinions," confronting the Party and the people. How infuriating this is!

    The "People's Daily" editorial on June 10th specifically pointed out: The basic backbone of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is: imperialist Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and turncoats who surrendered to the enemy. (Judging from the materials exposed in various newspapers later, there are also landlords and local bullies.) From this, we can get another enlightenment: the members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group are complex and cannot exist independently; they must communicate and collude with other counter-revolutionaries, and they must also become an integral part of the imperialist Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's entire sabotage activities against the Chinese revolution. Therefore, eliminating the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all hidden counter-revolutionaries has become a serious task of our current class struggle.

    After we recognize the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we will no longer be numb and sleep with tigers. We will closely unite around the Party, raise our political vigilance, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all counter-revolutionaries!

    当前阶级斗争的严重任务
    孟超
    在“人民日报”揭露了关于胡风反革命集团的第一、二两批材料以后，全国各地广大人民群众无不愤怒地戟指着追问：“他们的政治背景到底是什么？”“他们的主子到底是谁？”因为人民的眼睛是雪亮的，谁看了第一、二两批材料所揭露的胡风反革命的阴谋活动，也不会相信他们没有政治背景，他们没有后台老板的。
    现在“人民日报”又把第三批材料揭露出来了，也就是把他们的老根挖出来了。这一群打着进步文艺幌子的败类，就是丑恶不堪的蒋介石匪帮的走狗。他们标榜的“主观战斗精神”，也就是伸着血腥的罪恶的手掌，妄想颠覆中国人民革命事业，而为蒋介石匪帮出力卖劲。
    全国解放以前，多少年来中国人民受尽了蒋介石匪徒特务的荼毒迫害；解放后一直到现在蒋匪还盘踞在台湾，并且勾结美帝国主义，不断地对我们进行扰乱。而在另一方面，胡风反革命集团——蒋介石匪帮的骚扰的“别动队”，也遥相呼应地对我们使尽了找缺口、钻空子、挑拨离间，种种破坏伎俩；以至明目张胆，公然提出反革命的“意见书”，对党、对人民进行对抗，这是多么使人愤怒的事！
    “人民日报”六月十日的社论中特别指出：胡风反革命集团的基本骨干是：帝国主义国民党特务分子，反动军官，托洛茨基分子，革命叛徒，自首变节分子。（从以后各地报纸所揭发的材料看，还有地主恶霸。）从这里我们又可以得到一个启示：胡风反革命集团分子是复杂的，而且不可能是独立存在的；他必然和其他反革命分子互通声息，互相勾结，也必然成为帝国主义蒋介石匪帮对中国革命整个的破坏活动的组成部分之一。因此肃清胡风反革命集团和一切潜藏的反革命分子，就成了我们当前阶级斗争的严重的任务。
    当我们认识了胡风反革命集团的真实面目以后，我们再也不会麻痹地同老虎睡在一起了。我们紧密地团结在党的周围，提高我们的政治警觉性，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭胡风反革命集团和一切反革命分子！
