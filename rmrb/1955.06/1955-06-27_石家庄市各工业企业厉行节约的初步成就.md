Preliminary Achievements of Industrial Enterprises in Shijiazhuang City in Practicing Economy
    Qi Quan Ke, Director of the Industry Department of the CPC Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee

    The work of practicing economy in industrial and transportation enterprises in Shijiazhuang City is gradually deepening, and the atmosphere of "saving is glorious, waste is shameful" has begun to be established among the workers. According to preliminary estimates, as a result of practicing economy, all industrial and transportation enterprises in the city can increase profits submitted to the state by at least five million yuan this year.

    The ideological resistance encountered in this mobilization for economy is greater than in many past tasks. Initially, different enterprises and different people had different understandings of economy. Some employees in larger enterprises believed that with such a large setup, waste was unavoidable. Some employees in smaller enterprises thought, "Let alone the fact that there is no waste here, even if there were, how much would it be worth?" Some employees in transportation departments said, "Our department is special and there is no way to save." Many staff in functional departments of enterprises said, "We do not directly participate in production, and economy has nothing to do with me." Many workshop directors and section chiefs in enterprises said, "Can a sheep pen be without wool? Can you eat without dropping rice grains? Whatever you do, you inevitably waste something." Some workers said, "Economy is the business of leading staff. No matter how much we save, it's just a tiny bit, not enough to tip the scales." When formulating economy plans, the more prominent resistance was complacency. Some people thought, "Isn't it all the same whether we make an economy plan or not?" Others emphasized unfavorable factors, did not seriously mobilize the masses to tap potential, and said, "As long as the higher authorities approve it, why bother digging for potential, what's the point?" Although the economy plans of some units were revised repeatedly, the plans remained conservative. For example, the Shijiazhuang Railway Locomotive Depot's plan for saving coal in the last eight months of this year was less than half of the actual savings in the first four months. When the implementation of the economy plan began, the main resistance was that some people opposed economy, improving quality, and ensuring safety to each other.

    In order to overcome the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, the CPC Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee decided to educate leading staff and workers by mobilizing the masses to thoroughly expose waste in various aspects, so that everyone could realize the seriousness of waste and the necessity of economy. At the same time, each enterprise conducted economic activity analysis, combined with specific ideological problems among the masses, and educated the workers by calculating the big picture and the small details, to improve the workers' consciousness and enthusiasm as masters of the country. The Municipal Committee also mobilized all propaganda tools to promptly commend good people and good deeds in practicing economy, and exposed and criticized various wasteful behaviors, thereby establishing a preliminary atmosphere of "saving is glorious, waste is shameful" among the workers.

    In the process of overcoming ideological obstacles, first clearing the minds of factory-level leading staff and constantly improving their understanding, and then mobilizing the masses layer by layer through them, is the key to deeply developing economy work. After the Hebei Daily exposed the wasteful behavior of the state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory on April 21 this year and published an editorial, the Municipal Committee immediately called on every leading staff member to seriously study the Hebei Daily editorial and conduct ideological inspection and criticism in connection with the situation of their own unit. Some leading staff in the Enamel Factory did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of economy, and the initial economy plan was less than 100,000 yuan. After the leading staff inspected their thinking and mobilized the masses at all levels to tap potential, the increased profit to be submitted to the state by the end of the year could reach 270,000 yuan. The original economy plan of the Pharmaceutical Factory was a loss-making plan, but the economy figures revised after the leading staff took the lead in inspecting their thinking exceeded the national profit plan by more than one time. After the Daxing Textile Factory analyzed the fact that 760,000 yuan was wasted from the second half of last year to February this year due to cost overruns, waste of raw cotton, backlog of materials, and poor quality, and calculated the fact that more than 270 pieces of cloth were wasted a year due to exceeding the quota of three to five inches of yarn, the original erroneous ideas of "nothing to save" and "waste is inevitable and doesn't matter" were overcome.

    Strengthening political and ideological leadership, mobilizing technical personnel and functional department staff, and organizing them to investigate and calculate accounts, conduct economic activity analysis, provide necessary information, and help leading staff and workers find the focus and goals of practicing economy, is very important for deeply tapping potential. For example, when the leaders of textile factories were making economy plans, they had no confidence in saving raw cotton and electricity, and were reluctant to confirm economy targets. However, after technical personnel held discussions and conducted specific measurements in the workshops, and found potential that could be tapped, they were able to confirm and improve economy targets.

    Economy is effective only when the potential of the enterprise is tapped from many aspects. Many enterprises and units in Shijiazhuang City initially only paid attention to overcoming superficial waste, while neglecting to analyze problems from the internal laws of production activities and grasp the key to economy. The reason for this phenomenon is that many employees have an unclear understanding of the essence of economy. In response to this situation, the Municipal Committee repeatedly pointed out that the purpose of economy is to universally adopt economically reasonable methods to use manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and to reduce costs, save funds, and expand accumulation on the basis of ensuring the comprehensive completion of tasks. The Municipal Committee repeatedly criticized the idea and practice of opposing practicing economy to improving quality and ensuring safety, and helped enterprise employees correctly understand the truth of comprehensive economy. After calculating three accounts (increased profit submission, turning dead money into live money, and saving social wealth), the railway system, according to preliminary calculations by the Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau and the Locomotive Depot, can save the country 6.97 million yuan in wealth in improving vehicle turnaround rate and actual load rate, in addition to directly increasing the submitted profit of more than 480,000 yuan. The Brick and Tile Factory of the Industrial Bureau calculated that as long as the percentage of first-class products is increased by 20%, it can pay 200,000 yuan more in profits.

    The first economy plan made by industrial and transportation enterprises in Shijiazhuang City was to increase profit submission by 2.84 million yuan for the whole year. After inspection and revision, it was increased to 4 million yuan, and now it has been increased to 5 million yuan. However, judging from the latest information, the potential is still great. Because at present, only some work has been done in saving raw materials, electricity, and fuel consumption. If we start from improving labor organization, saving manpower, saving management fees, reducing non-production expenses, shrinking management organizations, reducing non-production personnel, saving working capital, accelerating capital turnover, and turning dead money into live money, further tap potential, it is entirely possible to increase the submitted profit by 6 million yuan. From this, we deeply realize that the potential in enterprises is great, and the question is whether we can clearly and correctly recognize this potential and deeply tap this potential.

    Economy is a regular economic and political task for socialist enterprises. Economy work must be combined with improving enterprise management and with the central work, give play to the role of organization, and proceed step by step. After some units in Shijiazhuang City made economy plans, some people thought, "It's over." This is a manifestation of insufficient understanding of the regularity of economy.

    In order to realize the economy plan, the Municipal Committee requires each enterprise to pay attention to strengthening financial cost management, establish and improve quota management, especially raw material quota management, promote "limited material distribution", improve warehouse management, establish and improve the responsibility system around economy, and gradually lay the foundation for the comprehensive implementation of the economic accounting system, in addition to implementing the instructions of the higher administrative departments on improving management work. This can promote enterprises to improve management. The Railway Material Factory used to neglect management work, but now it has seriously studied the "three-three-five system work method". When receiving purchase orders, the supply department first understands the inventory of raw materials, then goes to the production unit to understand the practical usage, and finally, buys as much as needed and buys what is needed, and sends the materials directly to the material-using unit, so that each batch of materials can be delivered three days earlier, and the procedures are simplified, manpower is saved, material backlog is avoided, and capital turnover is accelerated. For example, Hou Dejin's group in the bogie team of the Freight Car Repair Factory has doubled its work efficiency after implementing bogie technology operations, establishing a material counting and acceptance system and a work post responsibility system, and strictly implementing the meeting for assigning work and the dynamic analysis meeting of foremen. The coking, coal loading, fire adjusting, heat repairing, and coke transportation groups in the coking workshop of the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant have improved the quality of coke by improving technology, improving operations, and closely cooperating with each other. By reducing the ash content alone, more than 42,000 yuan can be saved in the second to fourth quarters of this year.

    We must deeply mobilize the masses to carry out competitions in order to better realize the economy plan, and therefore we must attach importance to the role of trade unions and Communist Youth League organizations. In the economy work, the trade union organization in Shijiazhuang City organized inter-factory competitions among textile, flour, brick and tile, and electric power factories, and continued to carry out the coal-saving competition of the same type in the boiler industry. The spirit of practicing economy was implemented in summarizing and inspecting the implementation of the second quarter collective contract and signing the third quarter contract, and the implementation of the economy plan was taken as the main standard for assessing the performance of each enterprise. In addition, some enterprises have also focused on promoting the team and group economy accounting system, and organized team and group competitions around this. In the education of cultivating the communist moral character of youth and resisting the erosion of bourgeois ideology, the Communist Youth League also conducted specific education with "practicing economy and opposing waste" as the central content, and around practicing economy, convened a meeting of socialist activists and held a good Communist Youth League branch meeting to further mobilize the Communist Youth League members and all young workers to take the lead in economy. In promoting the team and group economy accounting, the Communist Youth League called on the Communist Youth League members and young workers activists to serve as accountants. The Communist Youth League also organized youth supervision posts with "practicing economy and opposing waste" as the central task. In short, the trade union and Communist Youth League organizations have carried out the work of their respective departments around practicing economy, and fully mobilized the masses to work hard to complete the economy plan.

    石家庄市各工业企业厉行节约的初步成就
    中共石家庄市委工业部部长  齐全科
    石家庄市各工业企业和交通运输业企业厉行节约的工作正在逐步深入开展，“节约光荣、浪费可耻”的风气已开始在职工群众中树立起来。据初步估计，由于厉行节约的结果，全市各工业企业和交通运输业企业今年至少可增加上缴利润五百万元。
    这次动员节约碰到的思想阻力，比过去许多工作所碰到的更多。最初，不同的企业和不同的人对节约有不同的认识。一些较大企业的职工认为摊子这么大，浪费是不可避免的。一些较小企业的职工则认为别说我们这里没啥浪费现象，就是都浪费了，能值几个大钱？一些交通运输部门的职工说：我们这个部门特殊，没法节约。还有不少企业的职能机构的工作人员说：我们不直接参加生产，节约与我无关。许多企业的车间主任和科长们说：羊圈里还能没有羊毛？吃饭还能不掉点饭粒？干什么的就难免要蹧蹋什么。有些工人却说：节约是领导工作人员的事，我们怎样节约，也不过是一星半点的，添不起秤来。在制定节约计划时，比较突出的阻力是保守自满情绪。有的人认为订不订节约计划还不是那么回事？还有的强调不利因素，不认真发动群众挖掘潜力，说：只要上级能批准就行了，何必再去挖什么潜力，费那个劲呢？有些单位的节约计划虽一再修改，但计划仍然保守，如石家庄铁路机务段今年后八个月的节约燃煤计划，还不及前四个月实际节约的一半。开始执行节约计划时，主要的阻力是有些人把节约、提高质量和保证安全相互对立起来。
    为了克服上述错误思想，中共石家庄市委决定通过发动群众，深入地揭发各方面的浪费现象，用以教育领导工作人员和职工群众，使大家认识到浪费的严重性和节约的必要性。同时，各企业通过经济活动分析，结合群众中的具体思想问题，用算大账、算细账的办法向职工群众进行了教育，以提高职工的国家主人翁的自觉性和积极性。市委还动员了一切宣传工具，及时地表扬了厉行节约的好人好事，揭发、批判了各种浪费行为，从而在职工群众中初步树立了“节约光荣、浪费可耻”的风气。
    在克服思想障碍的过程中，先打通厂级领导工作人员的思想，不断提高他们的认识，然后通过他们，层层发动群众，是深入开展节约工作的关键。今年四月二十一日河北日报揭发了国营石家庄第二棉纺织厂的浪费行为并发表社论后，市委立即号召每个领导工作人员认真学习河北日报社论，联系本单位情况展开思想检查和思想批判。搪瓷厂某些领导工作人员对节约意义认识不足，开始订的节约计划还不到十万元。领导工作人员检查了思想，并层层发动群众挖掘潜力以后，至年底可增加上缴利润二十七万元。制药厂原定的节约计划是个亏本的计划，但领导工作人员带头检查思想以后修订的节约数字，超过国家利润计划一倍以上。大兴纺织厂分析了从去年下半年到今年二月因成本超支、原棉浪费、物资积压、质量低劣而浪费七十六万元的事实，和计算了由于接头回丝超过定额三至五吋，一年就浪费二百七十多匹布的事实以后，原来认为“无约可节”、“浪费不可免、不算啥”的错误思想就被克服了。
    加强政治思想领导，把技术人员、职能机构的工作人员发动起来，并组织他们摸底算账，进行经济活动分析，提供必要的资料，帮助领导工作人员和职工群众找到厉行节约的重点和目标，以便深入挖掘潜力，这是很重要的。例如纺织业各厂的领导人员，在订节约计划时，对节约原棉、节约用电心里没底，迟迟不敢肯定节约指标，但经过技术人员座谈和深入车间具体测算，找到可挖掘的潜力，就能肯定并提高了节约指标。
    节约是要从多方面挖掘企业潜力才能有效的。石家庄市许多企业单位，最初只注意克服表面上的浪费，而忽视从生产内部活动规律中去分析问题并抓住节约的关键。产生这一现象的原因是许多职工对节约的精神实质认识不清。针对这一情况，市委一再指出：节约的目的在于普遍采取经济合理的方法使用人力、物力和财力，并在保证全面完成任务的基础上降低成本，节约资金，扩大积累。市委反复批判了那种把厉行节约和提高质量、保证安全等相互对立的思想和作法，帮助各企业职工正确地理解全面节约的道理。铁路系统通过算三笔账（增缴利润、死财变活财、节约社会财富）后，据石家庄铁路分局和机务段初步计算结果，除直接增加四十八万多元的上缴利润外，在提高车辆周转率和实载率方面尚可给国家节约六百九十七万元的财富。工业局的砖瓦厂计算出：只要增加百分之二十的一级品，就可多缴利润二十万元。
    石家庄全市各工业企业和交通运输业企业第一次订出的节约计划是全年增缴利润二百八十四万元，经过检查修订后增加到四百万元，现在又提高到五百万元。但从最近掌握的资料来看，潜力还是很大的。因为目前仅在节约原材料、电力、燃料消耗方面做了一些工作，如果从改进劳动组织，节约人力，节约管理费，减少非生产开支，紧缩管理机构，减少非生产人员，节约流动资金，加速资金周转，变死财为活财等方面着手，进一步挖掘潜力，增加六百万元的上缴利润是完全可能的。从这里，我们深深体会到：企业中的潜力是很大的，问题就在于我们能否清醒地正确地认识这些潜力，深入挖掘这些潜力。
    节约是社会主义企业经常的经济任务和政治任务。节约工作必须同改善企业管理相结合，同中心工作相结合，发挥组织作用，循序渐进地进行。石家庄市有些单位订出节约计划后，有人就认为“完事了”。这是对节约的经常性认识不足的表现。
    为了实现节约计划，市委要求各企业除了必须贯彻上级行政部门关于改善管理工作的指示外，应注意加强财务成本管理，建立和健全定额管理，特别是原材料定额管理，推行“限额发料”，改进仓库管理；围绕节约，逐步建立、健全责任制，逐步为全面贯彻经济核算制奠定基础。这样就能推动企业改善管理。铁路材料厂过去忽视管理工作，现在则认真学习了“三三五制工作法”，在接到订购单时，供应部门先了解原材料的库存量，后到生产单位了解实用量，最后，缺多少买多少，缺啥买啥，并把材料直接送到用料单位，使每批料可提前三天送到，并简化了手续，节约了人力，避免了材料积压，加速了资金周转。又如货车修理工厂台车班侯得金小组，在推行了台车技术作业，建立了点料验收制和工作岗位负责制，严格执行碰头派活会和领工员工长动态分析会以后，工作效率提高一倍。石家庄焦厂炼焦车间装煤、调火、热修、运焦等组，由于提高技术、改进操作、互相密切配合，提高了焦炭质量。仅降低灰份一项，今年二至四季度就可节约四万二千多元。
    必须深入发动群众开展竞赛，才能更好地实现节约计划，为此必须重视工会、青年团组织的作用。石家庄市工会组织在节约工作中，组织了纺织业、面粉业、砖瓦业、电业等各厂之间的厂际竞赛，继续开展了锅炉业同工种的节约用煤竞赛。在总结检查第二季度集体合同的执行和签订第三季度合同等工作中，贯彻了厉行节约的精神，并把节约计划的执行情形作为考核各企业成绩的主要标准。此外，有的企业还有重点地推行班组节约核算制，并以此为中心，组织班、组竞赛。青年团在培养青年共产主义道德品质，抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀的教育中，也以“厉行节约、反对浪费”为中心内容进行具体教育，更围绕着厉行节约，召开了建设社会主义积极分子大会，开好团支部大会，进一步发动团员和全体青年工人带头节约。在推行班、组节约核算中，青年团号召团员、青年工人积极分子担任核算员。青年团还组织了以“厉行节约、反对浪费”为中心任务的青年监督岗。总之，工会和青年团的组织，都围绕着厉行节约，开展了本部门的工作，充分发动群众为完成节约计划而努力。
