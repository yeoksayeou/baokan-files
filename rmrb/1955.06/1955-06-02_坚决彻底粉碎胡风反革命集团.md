Resolutely and Thoroughly Crush the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
Political Background of Hu Feng's Counter-Revolutionary Activities Must Be Investigated

Xu Hao, Hefei Railway Station Cultural Center, Anhui Province, writes: After reading the two sets of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I was shocked by Hu Feng's counter-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary sabotage activities under the guise of revolution for more than 20 years, and by their insidious intentions and despicable methods. This aroused my immense anger. I sincerely support the resolution of the Joint Enlarged Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on handling the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. I request the government to take necessary action on Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes. At the same time, I also suggest that the political background of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary activities be further investigated, and all followers of Hu Feng be thoroughly investigated so that they can truly repent and start anew.

I believe that the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is not an accidental event. This proves that the words repeatedly warned by the Party and revolutionary leaders are correct. When our country is in a period of transition, all the classes that have been overthrown and will be overthrown will never be reconciled to death, and will inevitably use all conspiracies and vicious means in all aspects to resist and struggle desperately. Foreign imperialists will also support and send spies and assassins to penetrate our revolution to carry out sabotage. Such events have occurred repeatedly during the period of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and our country has also continuously cracked counter-revolutionary conspiracy cases in various places. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a great victory for our revolution. The exposure of this clique is not merely a matter within the scope of literature and art, but a matter for all the people of our country. We should be vigilant because of this, and pay vigilant attention to the counter-revolutionary enemies who may use various disguises to carry out sabotage, expose them and eliminate them at any time, in order to defend the revolutionary cause and socialist construction!

On the other hand, the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique further proves the correct leadership of the Party and that Marxism is an invincible weapon. Even any counter-revolutionary elements disguised with Marxist rhetoric will be discovered and purged. I believe that the literary and art circles should further carry out the struggle against bourgeois idealism and thoroughly eliminate the influence of reactionary literary and artistic thought, firmly establish a Marxist-Leninist worldview. The ranks of literary and art workers should be more closely united around the Party, improve political vigilance, adhere to their positions, so that bad elements have no chance to take advantage of, and establish a reliable cornerstone for ensuring the healthy progress of socialist literature and art.

A letter from all teachers of the Chinese and Philosophy Departments of Peking University: The materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party clique published twice in the "People's Daily" have made us clearly see the hideous and cunning face and the heinous crimes of the Hu Feng reactionary clique in consistently opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing the revolution. We feel incomparable hatred and anger!

This is a planned, programmed, and organized counter-revolutionary secret organization, a sinister and stubborn political enemy of our 600 million people. They wore masks, mixed into the revolutionary ranks, painstakingly, watched for opportunities, used their tricks, and carried out all-pervasive sabotage activities, which damaged our literary and artistic, and even cultural and educational work. This is something we cannot tolerate! We must learn from this fact, unite more closely around the Party, and increase our vigilance a thousand-fold.

The evil ghost who has been wearing a "painted skin" for twenty years has finally had his disguise stripped off. This is a great victory for the Party and the people in the cause of socialist revolution and construction. We fully agree with the five resolutions unanimously adopted by the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on May 25. We firmly demand that Hu Feng, the head of this counter-revolutionary and his clique, be severely sanctioned and thoroughly destroyed; our struggle will not stop until the Hu Feng clique's problems are fully revealed and all Hu Feng elements have completely reformed!

A letter from Liu Mengqi and Li Tongji, workers of the Xiashu Iron Mine in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province: We are workers of the Xiashu Iron Mine in Jiangsu. After we saw the materials exposing the Hu Feng clique in the "People's Daily", we were very angry. This cunning and shameless guy has become so insane! For more than 20 years, the Hu Feng anti-Party clique has always regarded our Party as a deadly enemy, consistently hating the Party and hurting the Party, and consistently hating the revolution. He put on the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, used all kinds of despicable and vicious means to frantically attack our Party, and used the most vicious words in the world to slander the Communist Party that the people love most. Their "everything is for the cause, for a greater future." But what are their "cause" and "future"? It is counter-revolution.

Since liberation, it can be clearly seen from the secret letters he gave to his followers that the Party has given him a lot of education and warmth. But this inhuman guy became more hostile and hateful to the Party. What Hu Feng did and said was exactly the same as what the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents and spies did and said. Therefore, we suggest that this heinous anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspirator and careerist be tried, and that every lackey of his anti-Party clique be thoroughly investigated and dealt with appropriately.

A letter from Zhang Mingchao, Yuanyan Cotton Section of the Luan City Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Hebei Province: I am a young man who loves literature and art. After reading the two sets of materials exposed in the "People's Daily" on May 13 and 24 about the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, I was really frightened and couldn't help but shout: Hu Feng, the enemy of the revolution. We must resolutely smash this conspiracy clique!

Revolutionary literary and art writers were, are, and will be under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought, and will fight alongside the people of the whole country to build a better future for the motherland. But Hu Feng said, "Writers...seek help from Marxism-Leninism, we are not so blessed." The "we" here is obviously not a revolutionary literary and art writer, but a small group of anti-Party clique members who stand against us. It is not difficult to understand: "Sharpen my sword and spy on the direction," "Use Sun Wukong's tactics to get into the belly," "Bit by bit struggle," "Abide by organizational principles," "Cherish strength," "Preserve strength," and "Use an rubber-coated steel wire to whip prisoners, hurting them without leaving visible scars," etc. How sinister is the Hu Feng anti-Party and anti-people clique, and he and Chiang Kai-shek can be called brothers in distress.

Hu Feng's mask was finally exposed by the Party and the people. He wants to "seek rebirth in suffering," "for the cause, for a greater future." This "cause" and this "future" are undoubtedly the "cause" and "future" of the anti-Party clique. How cunning and venomous he is! "What has been criticized, what cannot be involved." What cannot be involved is of course his unspeakable "private talk." But his crimes are nakedly displayed in front of the people. Any counter-revolutionary, anti-Party, and anti-people conspiracy will inevitably be discovered by the people and eliminated by the people. We must continue to investigate Hu Feng's criminal activities.

I read an article written by Hu Feng about the combat hero Guo Junqing in the language textbook of the spare-time school. The title is: "Great Enthusiasm Creates Great People." From the title alone, it is not difficult to see that: "Great People" are created by "Great Enthusiasm." This is a replica of Hu Feng's "self-expansion," "subjective fighting spirit," and "personality power."

I request that Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress be revoked, and that this anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary guy be given the punishment he deserves.

Remove the Vermin of the People

A letter from Chai Gan, director of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Refresher Course in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province: After the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" was published, I read it with increasing anger and could no longer remain silent. In the past, under the reactionary rule, we traditional Chinese medicine practitioners did not and were not allowed to interfere in state affairs. Since the Communist Party came, they have regarded us as intellectuals and established refresher courses to teach us to study. I have improved my political awareness, my eyes have become brighter, I have distinguished right from wrong, and I have recognized the enemy from ourselves. Therefore, I hate Hu Feng, such a reactionary and hateful enemy, twelve thousand points. His attack on the Party and his sinful activities in attempting to subvert the revolution were both cunning and vicious. He never let up at any time. He is good at using his bloody and murderous tricks under the guise of Marxism and Soviet literary and artistic theory. He can do it hard or soft. He can "use a calm and composed mood" and ask his companions to be "extremely calm" and "endure," "stay in a cave with bad air," in order to "preserve strength," but on the other hand, he "cannot easily take a step back." He also adopted the tactics of besieging the Party with fatigue or "nerve warfare," the so-called "to entangle it in order to tire it out and break through it," to make the Party relax and be paralyzed, and then he would use the method of "slowly cutting with a soft knife" in an attempt to gradually weaken the Party's strength. Once his butcher knife is sharpened and the time comes, he will do it wantonly and rampantly. He also uses "Sun Wukong's tactics of getting into the belly" as his "heart-digging war," trying to overthrow the revolution from the root. This kind of vicious attempt is really hateful!

For twenty years, he has been a die-hard who has insisted on counter-revolutionary activities. Recently, while waving the white flag (false self-criticism) and pretending to surrender, he was "sharpening my sword and spying on the direction." His hatred for the Party and the revolution is so deep. What is the difference between him and the die-hard of Chiang Kai-shek?

We must eliminate vermin of the people like Hu Feng. I fully support the resolution of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and I, as a traditional Chinese medicine worker, request the government to impose severe legal sanctions on die-hard counter-revolutionary elements.

A letter from Ma Da of the Xinyang Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company in Henan Province: I am a staff member of a state-owned commercial department and a layman in literature and art. But because I am a Chinese, I hope that our people will live a happy life and that our country will transition to socialism as soon as possible. Therefore, I am very resentful of the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng.

Judging from the two batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, the Hu Feng anti-Party clique is no different from the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that opposes the Communist Party and opposes the revolution. What Hu Feng did echoed Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan. We cannot tolerate the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

After liberation, Hu Feng sent the backbone members of his clique to the Northeast and Tianjin to seize positions and launch continuous attacks on the Party, attempting to defeat the Communist Party that leads China and restore the counter-revolutionary regime. This is something that the Chinese people can never allow.

As a citizen of the People's Republic of China and as a staff member of a state-owned commercial department, I request that all of Hu Feng's positions be revoked and that Hu Feng be punished according to law.

A letter from Hu Bangding and 57 others from the Journalism Class of the Marxist-Leninist Academy: Cracking the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a victory for the Communist Party and a victory for the people. This is of great significance for ensuring the construction of socialism in our country.

We firmly support the five resolutions of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on May 25, and suggest that necessary action be taken against Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes to thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique!

The increasingly rampant criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique after liberation reflect the increasingly acute class struggle in our country. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's playing of double-dealing tactics shows that in the era of the victory of Marxism-Leninism, all enemies of Marxism-Leninism are more vicious and despicable. The fact that some backbone members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique were able to infiltrate the Party and use newspapers and publishing agencies to carry out criminal activities makes us further realize the importance of arming our minds with Marxism-Leninism and improving our political vigilance!

We are the Party's journalists and vanguards on the ideological front. We guarantee to work hard to learn Marxism-Leninism and strengthen Party spirit training so that we are good at identifying all the disguises of the enemy and defending the Party's principles of Marxism-Leninism. We must learn the glorious tradition of the Party newspaper in the irreconcilable struggle with the enemy, so that our newspapers become a powerful weapon for publicizing Marxism-Leninism, educating the masses, and attacking the enemy, in order to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and transformation!

Hu Feng's Elements' False Surrender Will Not Succeed

A letter from Yin Binglin and Yan Wu and nine other young embankment workers from the First Construction Site of the Wuhan Water Conservancy Engineering Company:

We have read the materials of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique continuously, which makes us unable to suppress our anger. Now we have finally seen the sinister guy Hu Feng who is anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary. In recent years, Hu Feng has given us young people a lot of poison. He hates the people and the revolution very much. But no matter how hidden his activities are, no matter what, he cannot escape the eyes of the people of the whole country. We have finally exposed the true face of this conspirator wearing a Marxist cloak. Hu Feng is no different from Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism. They are both our enemies. His attack on the revolution is in line with the attempt of the US-Chiang Kai-shek to "counterattack the mainland" and attempt to subvert our people's democratic regime. We must raise our iron fists to thoroughly crush this hidden enemy fortress. He wants to continue to deceive the people with false self-criticism and attempt to continue to attack the revolution. That is what he is dreaming about. In the past, he deceived young people, but now our young people will no longer be deceived. We fully support the resolutions of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and we suggest that necessary legal sanctions be taken against Hu Feng.

A letter from Huang Huiyou of the Heilongjiang Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital: After reading the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," I could not suppress the anger in my heart. This exposed Hu Feng as the chief culprit of the reactionary clique lurking in the literary and art circles, exposed his ferocious and evil face, and exposed his ugly face of waving his claws and rushing towards the Party and the people. Hu Feng wants to carry out reactionary propaganda and counter-revolutionary activities, so he prepares to lie dormant for a long time and seize the opportunity to sabotage. His methods are extremely sinister, sending his confidants into the Party to steal documents and inquire about information, almost doing everything. What is the difference between this kind of behavior and the behavior of Chiang Kai-shek bandits?

People can clearly see: Hu Feng was forced to wave the white flag and pretend to surrender, but he secretly hid his weapons and refused to let go. When there is an opportunity to take advantage of, he will launch a more rampant attack. But he finally couldn't deceive the eyes of the people, and his conspiracy was exposed. Hu Feng's anti-Party and anti-people crimes have been laid out in front of the people. Hu Feng and the members of his clique must sincerely repent, and any false surrender will not deceive people. Let the people of the whole country be more vigilant and let the minds of those who have sympathized with Hu Feng in the past wake up!

A letter from Wei Zhuo, staff member of the Yun'an Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yunyang County, Sichuan Province: Seeing the "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" exposed by Shu Wu in the "People's Daily" made me angry. Judging from the facts revealed, Hu Feng's attack on the Party and the Party's literary and art policies completely echoed and cooperated with the Kuomintang reactionary clique.

People will remember how Hu Feng launched a fierce attack on the "Literary Gazette" just a few months ago, claiming to be the defender of Marxism and the defender of the Party spirit principles of art. Hu Feng also believed that anyone who accused him was reversing, opposing, and canceling the principles of Marxism-Leninism; being divorced from politics and canceling Party spirit. When the criticism of Hu Feng's anti-Party thought was widely launched, Hu Feng made such a "self-criticism," half defending and half complaining, with snot and tears.

What kind of "self-criticism" is this? Is it answering the critic's "whip" "wrapped with rubber-coated steel wire"? Or is it "having to accompany you to dance the added official", "shaking hands and making peace" with us "with a smile wrapped in insult"?

We must expose Hu Feng's disguise! We must not tolerate Hu Feng's deception! We must be vigilant. Comrades, we must not let Hu Feng's anti-Party conspiracy succeed.

    坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团    
    要追查胡风反革命活动的政治背景
    安徽省合肥市车站文化馆徐浩来信：我看了揭露的胡风反革命阴谋集团的两批材料，对胡风二十多年来扛着革命招牌，进行反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋破坏活动，对他们用心之阴险，手段之卑鄙甚为震惊，这激起我的无比愤怒。我衷诚地拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议关于处理胡风反革命集团问题的决议。我要求政府对胡风的反革命罪行进行必要的处理。同时，我还建议要进一步追究胡风反革命活动的政治背景，彻查一切追随胡风的分子，使他们真正悔过自新，重新做人。
    我认为胡风反革命集团的揭露，并不是偶然事件，这是证明党和革命领袖所一再告诫我们的话是正确的。当我国处在过渡时期，一切被打倒和将被推翻的阶级绝不会甘心死亡，必然在各个方面用尽一切阴谋和毒辣的手段，进行反抗和垂死挣扎。而外国帝国主义者也会支持和派遣一些间谍、暗害者打入我们革命内部进行破坏。在苏联社会主义建设时期曾屡次出现过这样的事件，我国也曾不断在各地破获过反革命阴谋案件。胡风反革命集团的揭露是我们革命的一大胜利。这个集团的被揭露，决不仅仅是文艺范围内的事情，这是我们全国人民的事情。我们应当由此引起警惕，警觉地注意反革命敌人可能利用种种伪装进行破坏活动，随时揭露他们，消灭他们，以保卫革命事业，保卫社会主义建设！
    另一方面，从揭露胡风反革命集团事件上，更证明了党的正确领导，证明了马克思主义是无往不利的武器。即使任何以马克思主义的词句伪装的反革命分子，也会被发现，被肃清的。我认为文艺界还应当进一步开展反对资产阶级唯心主义思想的斗争，彻底肃清反动文艺思想的影响，牢固树立马克思列宁主义世界观。文艺工作者的队伍应当更紧密地团结在党的周围，提高政治警觉性，坚持立场，使坏分子无隙可乘，为保证社会主义的文学艺术的健康前进确立可靠的基石。
    北京大学中文系和哲学系全体教师来信：“人民日报”两次刊布的关于胡风反党集团的材料，让我们明确地看到胡风反动集团一贯反对党、反对人民、反对革命的狰狞狡狯的面目和恶贯满盈的罪行。我们感到无比的憎恨和愤怒！
    这是个有计划、有纲领、有党羽的反革命秘密组织，是我们全国六亿人民阴险而又顽强的政治死敌。他们戴着假面具，混在革命队伍里，处心积虑，窥伺机会，施展其鬼蜮伎俩，进行着无孔不入的破坏活动，致使我们的文艺以至文化教育工作遭受了损害。这是我们万万不能容忍的！我们必须从这次事实中接受经验教训，更紧密地团结在党的周围，千百倍地提高警惕。
    二十年来披着“画皮”的恶鬼终被剥掉伪装，这是党和人民在社会主义革命建设事业上的一次大胜利。我们完全同意五月二十五日中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议一致通过的五项决议，我们坚决要求给予胡风这个反革命头目及其集团以严厉的制裁和彻底的摧毁；胡风集团问题不全部水落石出，胡风分子不全部洗心革面，我们的斗争决不能罢休！
    江苏省句容县下蜀铁矿工人刘孟奇、李同基来信：我们是江苏下蜀铁矿工人，当我们看到了“人民日报”所揭发的胡风集团的材料后，非常愤怒。这个狡猾无耻的家伙，竟丧心病狂到这个地步！二十多年来，胡风反党集团一直把我们党当作死敌，一贯地痛恨党中伤党，一贯地痛恨革命。他披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，用尽了各种卑鄙毒辣的手段向我党猖狂进攻，他用了世界上最恶毒的字眼，污蔑人民最热爱的共产党。他们的“一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来”。可是他们的“事业”和“未来”是什么呢？就是反革命。
    自解放以来，从他给他的党徒们的密信里可清楚地看到，党给了他很多教育和温暖。但这个没有人味的家伙，对党更加敌对，更加仇恨，胡风所作所说的与美蒋特务间谍所作所说的完全一样。因此我们建议，审判这个万恶的反党、反人民、反革命的阴谋野心家，并彻底审查其反党集团的每一喽啰，酌情处理。
    河北省栾城县供销合作社原棉科张明超来信：我是个喜爱文艺的青年。我看完五月十三、二十四日“人民日报”揭露胡风反党集团的两批材料，真是不寒而栗，不禁大声疾呼：胡风，革命的敌人。我们一定要坚决粉碎这个阴谋集团！
    革命的文艺作家，过去是，现在、将来都一定是在马克思列宁主义的思想指导下，和全国人民一道为建设祖国美好的将来而斗争的。但胡风却是，“作家们……求救于马列，我们无此福分”。这里的“我们”显然不是革命的文艺作家，而是与我们相对峙的一小撮反党集团分子。这就不难理解：“磨我的剑，窥测方向”“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”“点滴斗争”“遵守组织原则”“爱惜力量”“保存力量”和“用橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子，打伤了而又表面上看不出伤痕”等等，胡风反党反人民的集团是何等阴险，他和蒋贼堪称难兄难弟。
  　胡风的假面具毕竟被党和人民揭穿了。他要“在忍受中求得重生”，“是为了事业，为了更远大的未来”，这个“事业”，这个“未来”无疑是反党集团的“事业”和“未来”。他是多么狡猾，多么阴毒！“批判了是什么，不能涉及的是什么”，不能涉及的当然是他的不可告人的“私房话”。但他的罪状到底是赤裸裸地摆在人们面前了，任何反革命反党反人民的阴谋勾当，是必然要被人民发觉，要被人民肃清的。我们还必须继续深究胡风的罪恶活动。
    我在业余学校语文课本读过胡风写的记战斗英雄郭俊卿的文章，题目是：“伟大的热情创造伟大的人”。单从题目就不难看出：“伟大的人”是由“伟大的热情”创造出来的，这正是胡风的“自我扩张”“主观战斗精神”“人格力量”的翻版。
    我要求撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格，对这个反党反人民反革命的家伙给以应得的惩处。
    把人民的蟊贼清除出去
    河南省新乡专区中医进修班主任柴干来信：“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”公布后，我是越读越愤恨，实在不能再缄默了。我们中医人员，在过去反动统治时代，是不过问也不得过问国家大事的。自从来了共产党，把我们当成脑力劳动者看待，成立了进修班，叫我们学习，我提高了政治觉悟，眼睛明亮了，分清了是非黑白，认清了敌我。因此，我对胡风这样反动可恶的敌人，是十二万分痛恨的。他对党的进攻，他企图颠覆革命的罪恶活动，其手腕既刁诈、又毒辣。他是无论在什么时候也不放松的。他善于在马克思主义和苏联文艺理论的伪装下，施用他鲜血淋淋、杀气腾腾的伎俩。他会硬干，又会软干，他会“用冷静的沉着的心情”，并约同伴们“千万冷静”“忍受”，“在空气坏的洞中多待”，以便“保存力量”，但一面他又“不能随便退一步”。他又采用围困党的疲惫战术或“神经战”，所谓“为了累倒它，为了冲破它，就得缠住它”，来使党松懈麻痹起来，他再“用软刀子慢慢割”的办法，企图逐渐削弱党的力量。一旦他的屠刀磨快时机来到时，他就大肆猖獗地干起来。他又会“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”作他的“挖心战”，想把革命从根底上推翻。这种恶毒的企图，实在是可恶极了！
    二十年来，他是坚持反革命活动的死硬派。最近他一面打着白旗（假检讨）假投降，一面却在“磨我的剑，窥测方向”，他对党对革命的仇恨是这么深，这和蒋介石死硬派有什么区别？
    我们对于胡风这样的人民蟊贼，是非清除他不可的。我完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，我并以一个中医工作者的身份，要求政府对死硬的反革命分子予以严厉的法律制裁。
    中国花纱布公司河南省信阳分公司马达来信：我是一个国营商业部门的工作人员，对文艺是个门外汉。但因为我是一个中国人，我希望我们的人民过幸福生活，我们的国家早日过渡到社会主义去，因此，我对于反革命的胡风是很愤恨的。
    从揭发的胡风反党集团的两批材料看，胡风反党集团是同反对共产党反对革命的蒋介石卖国集团是没有什么区别的。胡风的所作所为是和在台湾的蒋介石遥相呼应的。我们对胡风反革命集团的罪行是不能容忍的。
    解放后，胡风就派遣他的集团的骨干分子到东北、天津去夺取阵地，并向党作连续不断的进攻，企图把领导中国的共产党打垮，把反革命政权复辟，这是我们中国人民所万万不能容许的。
    作为一个中华人民共和国的公民，作为一个国营商业部门的工作人员，我要求依法撤销胡风的一切职务，并惩处胡风。
    马克思列宁学院新闻班胡邦定等五十七人来信：破获胡风反革命集团是共产党领导的胜利，人民的胜利。这对保证我国建设社会主义事业具有重大意义。
    我们坚决拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议五月二十五日的五项决议，并建议对胡风的反革命罪行进行必要的处理，彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团！
    解放后胡风反革命集团罪恶活动的日益猖狂，正反映了我国阶级斗争的日益尖锐。胡风反革命集团玩弄两面派手段，说明在马克思列宁主义胜利的时代，一切马克思列宁主义的敌人都更恶毒更卑鄙了。胡风反革命集团的某些骨干分子得以混入党内，利用报刊及出版机关进行罪恶活动的事实，使我们进一步认识到以马克思列宁主义武装我们的思想，提高我们的政治警惕性的严重意义！
    我们是党的新闻工作者，是思想战线上的尖兵。我们保证努力学好马克思列宁主义，加强党性锻炼，使我们善于识别敌人的一切伪装，捍卫马克思列宁主义的党性原则。我们要在和敌人作不调和的斗争中学习党报的光荣传统，使我们的报刊成为宣传马克思列宁主义、教育群众、打击敌人的强大武器，以保证社会主义建设和改造的顺利进行！
    胡风分子们假投降是不成的
    武汉市水利工程公司第一工地青年堤工尹炳麟、彦梧等九人来信：
    我们连续读了胡风反党集团的材料，使我们不能抑止我们的愤恨。现在我们终于看清了胡风这个反党反人民反革命的阴险家伙。几年来，胡风给予我们青年的毒害是很大的，他对于人民，对于革命是仇恨万分的。但不管他的活动多么隐蔽，无论如何，他也逃不过全国人民的眼睛。我们终于把这个披着马克思主义外衣的阴谋家的真面目揭露出来了。胡风和美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石没有什么不同。他们同是我们的敌人。他向革命的进攻，正和美蒋“反攻大陆”企图颠覆我人民民主政权的企图是里外相合的。我们必须举起铁拳彻底粉碎这暗藏的敌堡。他想用假检讨继续欺骗人民，企图继续向革命进攻，那是他在做梦。过去他欺骗青年，现在我们青年再也不会受骗了。我们完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，我们建议对胡风进行必要的法律制裁。
    黑龙江省结核防治院黄晖猷来信：看了“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”，我抑压不住心头的怒火。这暴露了胡风是潜伏在文艺界的反动集团的祸首罪魁，暴露了他那副狰狞凶恶的面目，暴露了他张牙舞爪地向党和人民猛扑的丑恶面目。胡风要进行反动宣传，进行反革命活动，就准备着长期潜伏，伺机破坏；而他的手段又极其阴险，派遣他的心腹分子打进党内偷窃文件，探听情报，几乎无所不为。这种行径和蒋匪特务的行径又有什么区别呢？
    人们很清楚地看出：胡风是被迫打着白旗假投降而却暗藏着武器不放的，待到有可乘之机，便再作更猖獗的进攻。但他终于骗不过人民的眼睛，他的阴谋被揭发出来了。胡风反党反人民的罪证已经摆在人们眼前了。胡风及其集团的分子们都要真诚改悔，任何假投降都骗不过人。让全国人民更提高警惕，让那些过去曾经同情过胡风的人的头脑清醒过来吧！
    四川省云阳县云安镇供销合作社工作人员魏涿?来信：看到“人民日报”所载舒芜揭露的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”，使我愤怒不止。从揭露的事实来看，胡风对党和党的文艺政策的进攻，完全是与国民党反动集团互相呼应，互相配合的。
    人们还会记得，仅仅几个月以前，胡风曾经是怎样气势汹汹地向“文艺报”发动进攻，自称为马克思主义的保卫者和艺术的党性原则的保卫者。胡风并认为凡指斥他的人都是颠倒、反对、取消马克思列宁主义底原则；脱离了政治，取消了党性。当批判胡风反党思想广泛展开以后，胡风就做了这样的“检讨”，半是辩解，半是诉苦，加上鼻涕和眼泪。
    这是什么“检讨”呢？是回答批评者的“用橡皮包着钢丝”的“鞭子”呢？还是“不得不奉陪一道跳加官”、“用微笑包着侮蔑”同我们“握手言欢”呢？
    胡风的伪装，我们必须揭穿！胡风的欺骗，我们决不能忍受！我们必须提高警惕。同志们，我们决不能让胡风反党的阴谋得逞。（附图片）    
    两个面孔，一个结局  方成　锺灵　作
