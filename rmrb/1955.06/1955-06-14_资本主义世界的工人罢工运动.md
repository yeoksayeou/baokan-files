    Worker Strikes in the Capitalist World
      British Railway Workers and Dockworkers Persist in Strikes
    The strike by British locomotive drivers and firemen has persisted for sixteen days as of the 13th. From the 8th to the 11th, British railway management and striking workers repeatedly held negotiations. Because the Conservative government refused to meet the workers' minimum wage demands before the end of the strike, negotiations between the striking workers and government authorities have been fruitless.
    According to foreign news agency reports, due to transportation difficulties, the mining and supply of industrial coal has been greatly reduced, and an increasing number of factories are announcing closures.
    The strike by British dockworkers and seamen is also continuing. The strike by 20,000 dockworkers has persisted for three weeks. According to a United Press International report on the 11th, more than 250 ships have been affected by the strike. At the same time, the seamen's strike has also affected eight large passenger ships.
      More Than 70,000 Workers in Singapore Hold a Strike
    Singapore police authorities announced on the morning of the 13th that more than 70,000 workers in Singapore had gone on strike. The strike by all Singapore bus drivers and conductors began on the afternoon of the 12th. Striking workers protested against the Singapore authorities' arrest of trade union workers on the 12th and expressed solidarity with the Singapore Harbour Board employees, who have been on strike for more than 40 days.
    The strike has brought 26 factories in Singapore to a standstill. All buses in Singapore have stopped running.
    On the 12th, Singapore authorities invoked the so-called "emergency regulations" and arrested six people, including five trade union workers and one secondary school teacher. The police also searched a trade union's premises. On the 13th, Singapore authorities dispatched a large number of armed police to the areas where the striking workers were located, and set up roadblocks in several places. British troops stationed in Singapore and Johor Bahru were also ordered to be ready to move at any time. Reuters said that Singapore is currently in a state of tension.
      The Strike of American Automobile Workers is Expanding
    The strike by workers at General Motors in the United States is expanding. As of June 10, the number of workers participating in the strike and those who have stopped working due to the strike has increased to 65,000. Workers at twelve of the company's factories in St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Trenton, Los Angeles, Kansas City and other places are on strike.
    The reason for the strike by General Motors workers is that the workers are demanding the signing of new labor contracts, increased wages and improved working conditions, but the capitalists are unwilling to meet the workers' demands. In order to intimidate the workers and attempt to force them to concede, General Motors has closed twenty factories from the 10th, "temporarily" laying off tens of thousands of workers.
      Workers at many factories of the "Ford Motor Company" are also continuing to strike in protest against the new contract recently concluded by the leadership of the United Automobile Workers Union and the company, which fails to meet the workers' demands. According to American newspapers, more than 80,000 Ford Motor Company workers have stopped working for one to two days in recent days. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    资本主义世界的工人罢工运动
      英国铁路工人和码头工人坚持罢工
    英国机车司机司炉工人的罢工到十三日为止已经坚持十六天了。从八日到十一日，英国铁路管理当局和罢工工人一再举行谈判。由于保守党政府拒绝在罢工结束前满足工人们关于工资的最低要求，罢工工人同政府当局的谈判一直没有结果。
    据外国通讯社消息，由于运输不便，工业用煤的开采量和供应量已经大大减少了，宣布关厂的工厂也越来越多。
    英国码头工人和海员的罢工也在继续中。两万码头工人的罢工已经坚持了三个星期。据合众社十一日消息，受到罢工影响的船只已经超过二百五十艘。同时，海员的罢工也已经波及八艘大邮船。
      新加坡七万多名工人举行罢工
    新加坡警察当局十三日上午宣布，新加坡已经有七万名以上的工人举行罢工。全新加坡公共汽车司机和售票员的罢工，在十二日下午即已开始。罢工工人抗议新加坡当局在十二日逮捕工会工作者，并且声援已经坚持罢工四十多天的新加坡海港局职工。
    罢工已经使新加坡二十六家工厂陷于停顿。全新加坡的公共汽车已经停止行驶。
    新加坡当局在十二日援引所谓“紧急条例”先后逮捕了六人，其中有工会工作者五人和中学教师一人。警察还搜查了一个工会的会所。十三日，新加坡当局又派出了大批武装警察到罢工工人所在的地区，并在若干地方设立了路障。驻在新加坡和柔佛新山的英国军队也奉命随时准备出动。路透社说，新加坡目前处在紧张的状态中。
      美国汽车工人的罢工日益扩大
    美国通用汽车公司工人的罢工正在扩大中。到六月十日，参加罢工以及由于罢工影响而停止工作的工人已经增加到六万五千人。在圣路易、匹兹堡、特伦顿、洛杉矶、堪萨斯城等地，这家公司的十二个工厂的工人都在罢工。
    通用汽车公司工人罢工的原因是工人要求签订新的劳资合同，提高工资和改善工作条件，但是资方却不肯答应工人的要求。为了恫吓工人和企图迫使工人让步，通用汽车公司从十日起关闭了二十个工厂，“临时”解雇了几万工人。
      “福特汽车公司”许多工厂的工人为了抗议最近联合汽车工人工会领导机构同公司缔结的不能满足工人要求的新合同，也在继续罢工。据美国报纸报道，近日来福特汽车公司有八万多工人停止了一天到两天的工作。　（据新华社讯）
