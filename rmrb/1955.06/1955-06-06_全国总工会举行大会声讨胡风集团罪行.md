Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting of staff members of directly affiliated organizations on the 4th to denounce the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. More than 2,000 staff members from various departments and offices of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, cadre schools, national industrial unions, the Workers' Daily, and the Workers' Publishing House attended the meeting.

    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting. He first pointed out that crushing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a serious political struggle. This is by no means just a matter for the literary and art circles; it has a national character. Trade union organizations and the working class cannot stand by as onlookers in this struggle. He said that some people believe that there are Hu Feng elements in the literary and art circles, but not in the trade union system, and there is a paralyzing sentiment that this is only a matter for the literary and art circles and has little to do with trade union organizations and the working class. This is not right.

    Lai Ruoyu then pointed out that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique hates the working class. Hu Feng and his minions have written many "works," some of which also write about workers, but they distort the image of workers and completely slander the working class. In Lu Ling's "The Story of Zhu Guihua," almost every worker is given vicious words such as "humble," "clumsy," "numb," and "dull." When these workers speak, they always "curse" and "make noise." Their minds are unhealthy, and their nerves are abnormal, as if they are all fools and madmen. In "Female Worker Zhao Meiying," a female worker is even written to be so mentally disturbed that she wants to become a prostitute. This is a great slander against the working class!

    Lai Ruoyu also pointed out that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique hates and opposes the workers and also wants to influence them. They not only conduct "work" in the cultural organizations of the trade union system, but also go directly to the workers. According to materials revealed by workers in Tianjin, A'long, a key member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, promoted many of Hu Feng's reactionary theories when he gave the first lesson at the Tianjin Workers' Amateur Art School in 1952, speaking for three hours. He opposed writing about workers improving their awareness and engaging in creative labor under the leadership of the Party, and opposed writing about model figures and model deeds, saying that these were all nonsense. He advocated writing about the life characteristics of workers. For example, he said that female workers in textile mills are prone to leg cramps, so they should write about leg cramps. A'long also advocated "writing about landlords from the perspective of peasants; writing about peasants from the perspective of landlords." By extrapolation, this actually means using the bourgeois perspective to write about workers.

    Lai Ruoyu said: We should also pay attention to a question: Are there any members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in our trade union system and industrial and mining enterprises? We must not deny this possibility. Hu Feng is good at using the tactic of "Sun Wukong drilling into the belly." His henchmen have infiltrated many of our work departments. Hu Feng himself is not a Communist Party member, but some of his henchmen have infiltrated the Party. Hu Feng himself is not a trade union member, but his henchmen may also infiltrate trade union organizations. We also have cultural organizations such as newspapers, publishing houses, and clubs, so it is of course possible for Hu Feng elements to infiltrate.

    Lai Ruoyu pointed out: In this serious political struggle, we should: continue to expose the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, let the workers recognize their true colors, and eliminate their influence among the workers. This work should be carried out in all places where there are trade union organizations and workers. According to the editor's note in the "People's Daily," Hu Feng elements are differentiated into core members and general members. Our policy toward them is to call on all Hu Feng elements who are willing to repent to stand up, criticize themselves, expose Hu Feng, and start a new life. For us, it is to raise vigilance and expose them. And we must expose all the hidden and disguised counter-revolutionary elements. We must carry out this struggle not only in the trade union system but also among the workers. We must immediately join this struggle!

    After listening to Lai Ruoyu's speech, the attendees were very indignant at the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. The conference also requested that all staff members of units directly under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions study and discuss documents exposing the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

    全国总工会举行大会声讨胡风集团罪行
    新华社五日讯　中华全国总工会在四日举行直属机关工作人员大会，声讨胡风反革命集团的罪行。到会的有全国总工会所属各个部、室、干部学校、各全国性产业工会、工人日报社、工人出版社等单位的工作人员两千多人。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在大会上讲话。他首先指出：粉碎胡风反革命集团是一场严重的政治斗争。这绝不仅仅是文艺界的事，它带有全民性，工会组织和工人阶级在这场斗争中，不能处在旁观的地位。他说有些人认为文艺界内有胡风分子，工会系统里没有，存在着麻痹情绪，认为这只是文艺界的事，与工会组织、工人阶级关系不大。这是不对的。
    赖若愚接着指出：胡风反革命集团是仇视工人阶级的。胡风和他的喽啰们写过不少“作品”，其中也有写工人的，但他们歪曲了工人的形象，完全诬蔑了工人阶级。胡风分子路翎在“朱桂花的故事”里所描写的工人，几乎没有一个不被加上“卑贱”、“拙笨”、“麻木”、“迟钝”等恶毒的字眼。这些工人讲起话来总是“叫骂”、“吵闹”，心理都不健康，神经都不正常，好像都是些傻子和疯子。在“女工赵梅英”一篇中，甚至把一个女工写得心理变态到要去当妓女。这完全是对工人阶级极大的诬蔑！
    赖若愚还指出：胡风反革命集团仇恨、反对工人，又想影响工人。他们不仅在工会系统的文化组织内，还直接到工人群众中进行“工作”。根据天津市工人揭发出来的材料，胡风反革命集团中的骨干分子阿垅，一九五二年在天津工人业余艺术学校上第一课的时候，讲了三小时，宣传胡风许多反动理论。他反对写工人在党的领导下提高觉悟，进行创造性的劳动，反对写模范人物、模范事迹，说这些都是胡闹。他主张写工人的生活特征，他比方说纱厂女工爱闹寒腿，就应该写寒腿。阿垅还主张“写地主，用农民眼光；写农民，用地主眼光”，推论下去，实际上就是要用资产阶级眼光来写工人。
    赖若愚说：我们还应该注意一个问题：胡风反革命集团分子，在我们工会系统和工矿企业中有没有呢？决不能否定这种可能性。胡风善于用“孙行者钻进肚皮”的战术，他的党羽钻进了我们的许多工作部门。胡风本人不是共产党员，他有些党羽却打进了党内。胡风本人不是工会会员，他的党羽也可能钻进工会组织来。我们也有报社、出版社、俱乐部等文化组织，当然也就可能有胡风分子钻进来。
    赖若愚指出：在这场严重的政治斗争中，我们应该：继续揭露胡风反革命集团的罪行，让工人群众认识他们的真面貌，肃清他们在工人中的影响。凡是有工会组织、工人群众的地方，都应该进行这项工作。根据“人民日报”的编者按语，胡风分子是有区别的，有骨干分子也有一般分子。我们对他们的政策就是要号召一切愿意悔改的胡风分子站出来，批判自己、揭露胡风，重新做人。对我们来说，就是要提高警惕，加以揭发。并且还要将一切暗藏的伪装的反革命分子都揭露出来。我们不仅要在工会系统中而且要在工人群众中开展这一斗争。我们必须立即投入这个斗争中来！
    在听了赖若愚的讲话后，到会的人对胡风反革命集团的罪行都非常愤慨。大会还要求中华全国总工会直属各单位的所有工作人员，都要对揭露胡风反革命集团罪行的文件进行学习和讨论。
