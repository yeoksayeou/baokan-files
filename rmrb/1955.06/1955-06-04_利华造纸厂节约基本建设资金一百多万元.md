Li Hua Paper Mill Saves Over One Million Yuan in Capital Construction Funds

    Shanghai State-owned Li Hua Paper Mill recently, based on the principle of thrift, seriously reviewed and revised its capital construction plan, cutting many construction projects that could be done or not done, and is expected to save more than one million yuan.
    Li Hua Paper Mill has a total of fourteen capital construction projects in the next two years, with a large scale of construction. In April of this year, the Party organization of this factory, based on the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to correct the tendency of blind development in industrial construction, examined the factory's capital construction plan and found that many projects were formulated simply to show off, not based on actual needs and economic principles. For example, seeing that the water tower of another factory was more than one hundred feet high, they also proposed to raise the water tower and build an unnecessary spiral staircase that would cost more money. Some projects, although useful for improving production, were not urgently needed at present. Some only needed to make some local improvements to the old equipment to continue using it, without the need for new construction. If carried out according to the original plan, many departments in the factory would partially stop production, affecting the completion of the annual production plan. After the Party organization mobilized the workers to systematically examine these wasteful situations, they suggested that the administrative side revise the capital construction plan. Now many projects have been approved for reduction by the higher-level leading organs. In this way, normal production can be guaranteed. (Our reporter stationed in Shanghai)

    利华造纸厂节约基本建设资金一百多万元
    上海国营利华造纸厂最近根据节约原则，认真审核和修改厂里的基本建设计划，削减了许多可办可不办的工程项目，预计可以节省资金一百多万元。
    利华造纸厂今明两年内的基本建设共有十四项，工程规模庞大。今年四月间这个厂的党组织根据中共上海市委纠正工业建设中盲目发展倾向的指示，检查了厂里的基本建设计划，发现有不少项目是单纯为了讲究排场、不是从实际需要和经济原则出发制定的。例如看到别的厂水塔有一百多尺高，因而也提出要提高水塔，并且要修建既多花钱而又不必要的螺旋式楼梯。有些项目对改进生产虽然有用，但却不是目前所急需的。有的只要对旧设备进行一些局部的改进，就可以继续使用，不必新建。如果按原计划进行，厂里的许多部门将局部停止生产，影响全年生产计划的完成，党组织发动工人系统地检查了这些浪费情况以后，就建议行政方面修改基本建设计划。现在许多项目已经上级领导机关批准削减。这样，就可以保证正常进行生产。（本报驻上海记者）
