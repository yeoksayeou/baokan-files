Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 9th: "People's Daily" and "Izvestia" published editorials on June 9th, commenting on the relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

    "People's Daily" wrote that normal and good relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Germany are a decisive condition for safeguarding and consolidating peace in Europe. It is from this point of view that the Soviet government has sent a note to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, proposing the establishment of direct diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany.

    This initiative of the Soviet government is in the interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Germany, and at the same time will promote the easing of the general international tension. The normalization of this relationship is first and foremost what the peoples of the Soviet Union and Germany urgently require, and it is also fully in line with the interests of consolidating peace and security in Europe.

    The editorial concludes by writing that the Soviet people have absolutely no feelings of hatred towards the German people. The Soviet people advocate a decisive change in the relations between the two countries, in order to maintain normal and good relations with the German people.

    "Izvestia's" editorial wrote that when the Soviet and German peoples move forward together to safeguard peace in Europe, European security is consolidated. When there is a lack of normal and good relations between the Soviet and German peoples, a different situation arises in Europe. The lessons of history cannot be erased from the consciousness of all peoples. Everyone who hopes to safeguard peace and consolidate peace advocates that, in order to consolidate peace in Europe, the relations between the two peoples should develop and consolidate in a direction that conforms to the national interests of the two peoples.

    "Izvestia" concludes by saying: The Soviet government's proposal to establish and develop normal relations based on mutual trust and peaceful cooperation stems from the belief that this will help resolve the outstanding issues related to the whole of Germany, and thus help resolve the main issue for the entire German people—restoring the unity of democratic Germany.

    “真理报”和“消息报”评苏联和西德的关系
    新华社九日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”和“消息报”九日发表社论，评论苏联和德意志联邦共和国的关系。
    “真理报”写道，苏、德两国人民之间的正常的良好的关系是保卫和巩固欧洲和平的决定性的条件。正是从这一点出发，苏联政府照会西德联邦共和国政府，建议建立苏联和西德之间的直接的外交和贸易以及文化的关系。
    苏联政府的这一创议符合于苏德两国人民的利益，同时将促进普遍的国际紧张局势的缓和。这种关系的正常化首先是苏德两国人民所切身要求的，也是完全符合巩固欧洲各国的和平和安全的利益的。
    社论最后写道，苏联人民绝没有仇恨德国人民的感情。苏联人主张两国关系来一个坚决的转变，以同德国人民保持正常和良好的关系。
    “消息报”的社论写道，当苏联人民和德国人民为维护欧洲和平而一道前进的时候，欧洲安全就得到巩固。而当苏联和德国人民之间缺乏正常的良好关系的时候，在欧洲就形成了另外一种局面。历史的教训是不能从各国人民的意识中抹掉的。每一个希望维护和平和巩固和平的人都主张，为了巩固欧洲和平，两国人民之间的关系应该朝着符合两国人民的民族利益的方向发展和巩固。
    “消息报”最后说：苏联政府建议建立和发展以互相信任和和平合作为基础的正常关系，它的出发点是，这会有助于解决同整个德国有关的悬而未决的问题，从而有助于解决德国全国人民的主要问题——恢复民主德国的统一。
