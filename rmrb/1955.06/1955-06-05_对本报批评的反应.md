    Reactions to Criticisms in This Newspaper
    In the article "Special Care Funds Should Not Be Held Up or Misappropriated," published in this newspaper on April 26th, criticism was made of the misappropriation of special care funds by Qianqiao District, Hudong County, Anhui Province, to repair the district chief's residence. Now, the Civil Affairs Section of Hudong County has written to say that Qian Junting, the deputy district chief of Qianqiao District, did indeed misappropriate special care funds to repair housing. This criticism is correct. After this situation was discovered, the County People's Supervisory Committee sent people to investigate. Based on the circumstances of the misappropriation, in addition to being ordered to return the funds, a notice was circulated throughout the county criticizing him. The main reason for this occurrence is that the county did not closely monitor the reimbursement system, which created opportunities for districts and townships to hold up and misappropriate special care funds. In order to prevent this phenomenon from happening again, the county has strictly implemented the reimbursement system, requiring reimbursement within a set time limit for each payment. This year, a method of "first allocating a control number of funds to the districts, then having the townships assess the relief recipients first, and then allocating funds" has been adopted. Due to the adoption of the above measures, no further instances of holding up or misappropriation have been discovered.

    In the article "How Do You View the Party Branch's Work?" published in this newspaper on April 16th, the error of Comrade Zhu Ze, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture, being unwilling to serve as the Party Branch Secretary was criticized. After this article was published, the Party Branch Committee of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture immediately conducted a review, and Comrade Zhu Ze himself also made a self-criticism. In his self-criticism, he said: "As a Party cadre, it is wrong to be unwilling to serve as the Party Branch Secretary when nominated by everyone. In fact, apart from administrative work, it is not that there is no time to do Party Branch work."

    对本报批评的反应
    四月二十六日本报发表的“优抚事业费不应积压和挪用”一文中，对安徽省湖东县钱桥区挪用优抚事业费修理区长宿舍一事提出批评。现在湖东县民政科来信说，钱桥区副区长钱俊庭确曾挪用优抚事业费修理房屋。这一批评是对的。这一情况被发现后，即由县人民监察委员会派人进行了检查，根据挪用情节，除责成归还外，并通报全县予以批评。产生这种事情的主要原因，是由于县对报销制度抓得不紧，以致给区、乡造成积压和挪用优抚事业费的机会。为了防止这一现象的再次发生，县已严格执行了报销制度，每次发款均限期报销；今年更采取“先将款数分配一个控制数到区，以乡为单位先行评定救济对象，然后再拨款”的办法。由于采取了上述措施，再没有发现积压和挪用现象。

    四月十六日本报在“你怎样看待党的支部工作？”一文中，批评了天津市文化局副局长朱仄同志不愿做支部书记的错误。这篇文章发表以后，中共天津市文化局支部委员会即作了检查，朱仄同志本人也作了检讨。他在检讨中说：“作为一个党的干部，在大家的推选下不愿做支部书记是错误的，事实上，行政工作以外，并不是没有时间做支部工作。”
