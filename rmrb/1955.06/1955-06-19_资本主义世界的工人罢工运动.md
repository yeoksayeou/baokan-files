    Workers' Strike Movement in the Capitalist World
      American Maritime Workers Begin Strike, Auto Workers Persist in Strike
    Negotiations between the American National Maritime Union and shipowners regarding the signing of a new contract broke down on the evening of the 15th. The union issued a strike order to all branches on the 16th. The strike has already begun in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New Orleans, and is continuing to develop. According to Agence France-Presse, if the strike expands to all ports along the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico, it will halt eight hundred American ships in eighteen ports, involving twenty-eight thousand officers and sailors.
    More than 50,000 workers in seventeen General Motors factories across the United States are still persisting in their strike.
      British Dockworkers' and Seamen's Strike Continues to Expand
    The British dockworkers' and seamen's strike is continuing.
    As of the 16th, the strike by 20,000 dockworkers had persisted for twenty-five days. The number of ships affected by the strike has increased to nearly three hundred.
    The seamen's strike, which began on May 31 and gradually expanded thereafter, has been further amplified by the strike of seamen on one of the world's largest mail ships, the 81,000-ton "Queen Mary." Currently, the number of mail ships that have ceased sailing due to the seamen's strike has increased to nine.
    Agence France-Presse, in a dispatch from London, revealed that the British government and British shipping companies are using crude measures to threaten the striking seamen. The message said: About one hundred crew members of transatlantic passenger ships who are participating in the strike have received orders from the Ministry of Labour to return the documents exempting them from military service. In Britain, crew members on merchant ships are generally exempt from military service, which means that the government is using military service to coerce seamen to return to work. In addition, about three hundred seamen have received dismissal notices from their companies.
      Tens of Thousands of Workers in Singapore Continue to Strike
    Tens of thousands of Singapore workers continued to strike from the 14th to the 16th to protest the Singapore government's arrest of trade union leaders and to support the striking workers of the Singapore Harbour Board. Drivers of more than 1,500 taxis also stopped working on the 14th.
    Nearly one hundred factories, transportation enterprises, and other industries have been completely shut down. Public bus transportation throughout the city continues to be paralyzed.
    Two thousand drivers and ticket collectors of the Singapore Tramway Company, who began striking on the afternoon of the 12th, held a meeting on the evening of the 15th and resolved to continue the strike until the recently arrested trade union workers are released.
    The Singapore authorities brought some of the arrested trade union leaders to court for trial on the 14th. According to a spokesman for the Singapore police authorities, the police arrested another sixteen people on the 14th.
      Japanese Miners' Strike of 50,000 Workers Ends in Victory
    Approximately 50,000 miners belonging to the All-Japan Federation of Metal Mine Workers' Unions ended their strike on the 17th. The miners, who had persisted in their struggle for more than forty days since launching their first strike on May 5, finally forced the capitalists to agree to increase wages and provide allowances.
      Workers at Japan's Fuji Motors Company Strike to Protest Layoffs
    Approximately 2,900 workers at the Yokosuka factory of Japan's Fuji Motors Company held a two-hour strike on the 16th to protest the company's plan to lay off 60 percent of the workers—more than 3,700 people—under the direction of the U.S. military authorities. The workers of this company, which specializes in manufacturing military supplies for the U.S. military, have been continuously fighting against the layoff plan.
    According to Kyodo News, Inajiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Right-Wing Socialist Party of Japan, has requested the government to find a way to have the U.S. military authorities cancel the plan to lay off workers. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    资本主义世界的工人罢工运动
      美国海员工人开始罢工，汽车工人坚持罢工
    美国全国海员工会同船主间关于订立新合同的谈判于十五日晚间陷于破裂。工会在十六日向各分会发出了罢工命令。罢工已经首先在费城、巴尔的摩和新奥尔良等地开始，并且正在继续发展中。据法新社报道，如果罢工扩展到大西洋沿岸和墨西哥海所有各港口，便将使十八个港口的八百艘美国船只陷于停顿，二万八千名职员和水手卷入罢工。
    在美国通用汽车公司全国各地十七个工厂中，仍有五万多工人在坚持罢工。
      英国码头工人和海员的罢工继续扩大
    英国码头工人和海员工人的罢工正在继续中。
    到十六日为止，两万名码头工人的罢工已经坚持了二十五天。受罢工影响的船只已经增加到近三百艘。
    海员工人从五月三十一日开始而在以后陆续扩大了的罢工，已经因为世界上最大的两艘邮船之一——八万一千吨的“玛丽皇后号”海员罢工而更形扩大了。目前，因为海员罢工而停止航行的邮船已经增加到九艘。
    法新社发自伦敦的一条消息透露了英国政府和英国航运公司正在用粗暴的措施威胁罢工的海员们。消息说：在参加罢工的横渡大西洋的客船船员中，约一百名船员已经得到劳工部的命令，要他们缴回免除他们服兵役的证件。在英国，商船上的船员一般是免服兵役的，这就是说，政府在用服兵役来胁迫海员复工。此外，约有三百名海员已经接到了公司方面的解雇通知。
      新加坡数万工人继续举行罢工
    数万新加坡工人十四日到十六日继续举行罢工，抗议新加坡政府逮捕工会领袖和声援新加坡海港局罢工职工。一千五百多辆出租汽车的司机也在十四日停工。
    完全停顿的工厂、运输企业和其他产业已有近百个单位。全市的公共汽车交通继续陷于瘫痪。
    十二日下午开始罢工的新加坡电车公司二千名司机和售票员在十五日晚举行会议，决议继续罢工直到最近被逮捕的工会工作者获得释放为止。
    新加坡当局十四日将部分被逮捕的工会领袖押到法庭加以审讯。据新加坡警察当局发言人宣布，警察在十四日又逮捕了十六人。
      日本五万名矿工罢工胜利结束
    属于全日本金属矿山工会联合会的矿工约五万人，十七日结束了他们的罢工。矿工们从五月五日开始举行第一次罢工以来，坚持四十多天斗争的结果，终于迫使资方答应增加工资和发给津贴。
      日本富士汽车公司工人罢工抗议解雇工人
    日本富士汽车公司追滨工厂的约两千九百名工人，在十六日举行了两小时的罢工，抗议公司在美军当局指使下计划解雇百分之六十的工人——三千七百多人。这家专门为美军制造军需品的公司的工人们，在这以前曾经不断地进行了反对解雇计划的斗争。
    据共同社报道，日本右派社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎已经要求政府设法使美军当局取消解雇工人的计划。　　　　　　　　　（据新华社讯）
