Resolutely and Thoroughly Crush the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique

Cannot Let Rats Cross the Street
Shi Jinmo
Since seeing many articles criticizing Hu Feng in the newspapers, I thought Hu Feng was a person with ideological errors who wore the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and whose words and deeds were inconsistent. After reading the two sets of exposure materials, I realized that Hu Feng was a counter-revolutionary element with the face of a human but the heart of a beast.

Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique systematically and step-by-step infiltrated various national organizations, carrying out criminal activities of sabotage, slander, and instigation, attempting to pave the way for his master's restoration conspiracy. But Hu Feng has forgotten the level of people's awareness; this despicable and shameless thing can no longer hide under the sun. Therefore, I believe that his punishment should not only be the removal of all his positions, but also severe punishment! We cannot let rats cross the street!

This incident has taught me a great lesson. Only by strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism can we raise our understanding and vigilance; in particular, we must study dialectical materialism to clarify our paralyzing thoughts, recognize the enemy, and prevent disguised bad elements from taking advantage of opportunities; at the same time, we must closely unite traditional Chinese and Western medicine, work hard together, learn from each other, and strive together for our great socialist construction!

Supporting the Suggestion of Punishing Hu Feng According to Law
Yang Weiyu
When the Hu Feng issue was first raised in the newspapers and periodicals, I only thought that Hu Feng's thinking was vague and his views were incorrect; who knew that it was far more than that. After reading the large amount of materials exposed in the "People's Daily" on May 13th and 24th about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I clearly saw Hu Feng's true ugly face and confirmed that Hu Feng was a reactionary element who wore the cloak of Marxism, who had been lurking in the revolutionary camp for a long time, who arrogantly organized a counter-revolutionary clique, and who consistently issued orders and carried out heinous counter-revolutionary activities.

Everyone is clear that the Chinese people have achieved one victory after another, liberated the entire mainland of China, are now going to liberate Taiwan, and are carrying out the even greater and happier socialist construction work, doing extremely glorious and great undertakings that our predecessors have never done before, thanks to the wise and correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The literary and artistic policy pointed out by Chairman Mao in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is extremely correct. It is precisely because of such correct leadership and instructions that our literary and artistic work now shows a prosperous scene of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." However, Hu Feng actually frantically used an attitude of resistance and hostility, slandering it as "a small booklet treated as a 'totem,'" and also used words such as "board of directors," "official," "mandarin gown," "master," "gentry," and "philistine" to curse and insult the Party and progressive writers united around the Party. His reactionary absurdity makes me infinitely angry, and I really have the feeling of "If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated?"

Hu Feng also directed his counter-revolutionary clique members to infiltrate the Party and people's organizations, establish strongholds, gather information, and steal documents, using weapons of so-called "a whip wrapped in rubber to beat prisoners," "using the tactics of cluster grenades," and "using the tactics of Sun Wukong entering the belly," which further shows his reactionary viciousness to the extreme. He is already a public enemy of the people and is absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country.

Hu Feng, wearing the cloak of Marxism, has been engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for more than 20 years. The fact that he can now be exposed is another great and brilliant victory for the people of the whole country in the process of revolutionary work.

We must resolutely defend the fruits of the people's revolutionary victory and absolutely not allow such counter-revolutionary elements to remain in our revolutionary ranks.

I fully support the proposal to remove Hu Feng from all positions and severely punish Hu Feng according to law. I demand that this enemy be quickly purged from the people, resolutely and thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and purify our revolutionary ranks to ensure the victorious success of the great socialist construction of the motherland.

Must Dig to the Roots
Liu Qing
Seeing the batches of materials and articles exposing Hu Feng published in the newspapers while in my hospital bed, the face with a fake smile and a black heart in his belly seemed to be right in front of me. I stared at the blue sky outside the window, the bushes outside the wall, and the tall building frames towering behind the bushes. I really didn't expect that the "great brave man" with a "subjective fighting spirit" who "wedged" himself into our "world" was like this! What a "simple writer" and "organizer of literary work"! Hu Feng's secret letters are his confession, full of "black language," vividly describing the ugly face of a sinister spy and organizer of counter-revolutionary activities!

Hu Feng showed his "sincerity" in those secret letters, so no matter how long they are, people can read them in one breath. But in his previously publicly published articles and books, they are all lies, so people can't read them no matter what. I had never finished reading an article by Hu Feng before, and his "opinions" were the first time I finished reading. My feeling was that I was reading something written by a confused person, and I couldn't understand it at all. Why would he only cut out a sentence or two from the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Comrade Mao Zedong, distort them, and then vainly attempt to overthrow the Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic policy? Why doesn't he see all the books published, plays performed, and movies filmed after liberation? Why are all the writings of his subordinates good? Why does he demand that the publications of writers' groups be abolished and that the outdated state of independent governance be restored? Why, why... so many whys! Now we have all found answers from his secret letters. He uses the "tactics of entering the belly" to carry out "heart-digging warfare." He is not a "writer" at all, but a counter-revolutionary boss who is mixed in among us. Even the sentence or two he used in his "opinions" that he cut from "Marx, Engels, Stalin, Lenin, Mao, and now Soviet theory" were found the "source and page number" for him by his lackeys. Can we not raise our vigilance?

I only met Hu Feng in 1949 when I arrived in Beijing, which had just been liberated. The first time we met, he was so "affectionate"! He said that he and I were old friends who had never met before, and then he started talking to me about Xue Wei. He told me a lot of Xue Wei's intimate things that I didn't even have a clue about, and asked me if I often corresponded with Xue Wei. Because it was the first time we met, I had to politely listen to him with a smile. When I told him that Xue Wei and I only nodded and shook hands, he was a little embarrassed. At that time, I thought it was a general misunderstanding. Later, when I learned about the relationship between Hu Feng and Xue Wei from a comrade, I realized that Hu Feng regarded me as one of their group; because Xue Wei had written an incorrect article "praising" my "Record of Planting Grain," attached to his book "On the Direction of Literature for Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers," which had many fallacious arguments. I have read that article. I saw that there was a despicable and sinister motive hidden in it: attempting to use my obviously immature practice work to obliterate the works of another writer and distort the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Later, some individual comrades who had not been to Yan'an or had been there for a short time asked me about my relationship with Xue Wei, and I always had an unspeakable feeling of being insulted; because I was confident that even if I had many shortcomings in my thinking, I was always different from them.

Thinking about it now, it is as clear as yesterday—Hu Feng once very "sincerely" told me: Xue Wei was wrong, "Record of Planting Grain" is not a realistic book, but an objective book. He said: I was drowned by life, so I couldn't see the author's "subjective role." He put on the airs of a guide, saying that I should "fight life" and "attack life." Thinking of these today, I can't help but feel terrified. Fortunately, I still have some antitoxin in my thinking, and I didn't listen to the nonsense of this "theoretician." Later, I didn't "fight life" or "attack life," but fought and attacked the difficulties and various enemies I encountered in life! I know: It is possible for a beginner writer to be drowned by life, but that is mainly not a matter of "subjective role," but a matter of Marxist-Leninist theoretical cultivation and mastery of realistic creation methods. People! Follow the Party and the people closely and be vigilant against being deceived at all times!

Regarding Hu Feng, we no longer have as many questions as we did before exposing him. He has already "self-expanded" and exploded. Regarding him, we only have one question to thoroughly clarify: What kind of political scum of this century is he dreaming of the "future" with? This is the most important thing and must be clarified; he and his group have "burdened" us for twenty years, "entangled" us for twenty years, where is the root cause in the end? Must dig to the roots!

Be Vigilant Against Hidden and Disguised Enemies at All Times and Places
Chen Bochui
The criminal actions of the anti-Party and anti-people Hu Feng and his clique, after the "People's Daily" published the materials twice, are truly as numerous as mountains of evidence, arousing the public anger of the people of the whole country, and a deep-seated feeling of disgust and contempt for this group of literary and artistic degenerates and political counter-revolutionaries who have severed ties with the Party and the people, and demanding that they be purged and severely punished.

Hu Feng and the clique he commanded have consistently engaged in the reactionary work of expanding organizations and establishing strongholds. After reading the second batch of materials, I suddenly became alert and remembered something that should be exposed.

In the first half of 1953, the "Children's Publishing House" had only been established in Shanghai for a few months when it received a manuscript of a fairy tale poem called "Bridge and Wall" transferred from the "New Literature Publishing House," written by Ji Fang. It is usually common practice between fraternal units to transfer manuscripts between publishing institutions, but what was unusual was that the manuscript was accompanied by a strange letter of introduction written by the "New Literature Publishing House"; I remember these sentences (the general idea is like this): "...This manuscript has already been decided to be adopted by our publishing house. If your publishing house does not use it, please return it to our publishing house, and we will still publish it..." Reading this letter made people feel uncomfortable, and it felt like there was some coercion and even threat.

At that time, we only felt that the wording of this letter was really inappropriate, but we did not expect that it also contained a conspiracy of "evil intentions."

After reviewing the manuscript, it was unanimously considered to be a bad fairy tale poem: loose, piled up, and inappropriately using symbolic techniques that children cannot understand. The poem listed many conceptual abstract nouns, so it seemed very empty. The biggest shortcoming is that the illusory images in the fairy tale do not conform to the natural laws and natural relationships of things themselves, so the imagery thinking violates logical thinking; especially the realistic significance of this fairy tale is also vague and unclear, at least it is not something that young children can understand.

So the manuscript was returned with "review opinions." I was still thinking in my heart: On what basis did the "New Literature Publishing House" decide to publish this manuscript? However, "Bridge and Wall" was actually published.

Now I know that Hu Feng and his clique's conspiratorial means of establishing activity strongholds and trying their best to expand their influence are truly ubiquitous, and they are unwilling to relax their grip on the children's literature front. Although this time, the pig's nose that broke in was driven back.

The revolutionary enemy is cunning, and we should learn from experience and lessons: take work seriously and earnestly, and prevent all gaps that the enemy can use, and not allow them to have the opportunity to "open up work." Be vigilant against hidden and disguised enemies at all times and places!

Thoroughly Crush the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
Lu Fu
The anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary conspiracies and sabotage activities of the Hu Feng reactionary clique have been continuously exposed. Its insidious, cunning, vile, and rampant crimes of attacking the Party and the literary and artistic front led by the Party have become increasingly obvious. The hatred we feel for such vicious enemies who are disguised as revolutionaries but are actually counter-revolutionaries is even more uncontrollable. I fully support the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, demanding severe punishment for the counter-revolutionary boss Hu Feng, continuing to expose the crimes of the members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and thoroughly crushing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique that attempts to sabotage the revolutionary cause.

Here, I want to expose some of the crimes of Geng Yong, a member of the Hu Feng reactionary clique that I came into contact with. Around 1951, Geng Yong once infiltrated the Shanghai People's Art Theater, where I worked, and served as a literary and artistic theory teacher in the actor training institution, spreading reactionary literary and artistic ideas among young actors; after leaving when the teaching period expired, he did not relax his poisoning of the theater. He continued to use despicable means to pull over individual members who were willing to accept his reactionary literary and artistic ideas, maintained regular contact with them, instigated them to slander the Party and the Party's literary and artistic leading comrades, and spread the erroneous remarks in his "'The True Story of Ah Q' Research." These pulled-over roles everywhere said: "Look how well Geng Yong said it!" When comrades disliked this megaphone of Geng Yong and argued with him, he said, "You are superstitious about Feng Xuefeng." He cursed the Communist Party as equal to "Yiguandao" and usually expressed contempt for Party and League activities. When young people enthusiastically wrote articles on the blackboard newspaper to express their active response to the leadership's call or to start criticism, he glanced at the blackboard newspaper with a contemptuous attitude and said: "The eternal theme." There were many such infuriating reactionary words. At that time, because we were not vigilant enough, we only regarded it as a general literary and artistic ideological problem and a general work style problem. We made some rebuttals to the two members who had been pulled over by him and recovered some young people who had been deceived by them. But they were not willing to be criticized. They only seemed to "go along" a little on the surface, but in reality, they continued to do evil, deliberately attacking Party members, League members, and active young people. When a League member made a mistake for a while and was criticized by the League organization, they would talk to them, pretending to give some "warmth"; when the masses sometimes had some opinions about the leaders, they would talk to them, pretending to express "sympathy." In essence, they were carrying out activities to undermine the unity of the revolutionary group and continuing to attempt to expand their "strength" behind their backs. After Comrade Zhou Yang's speech criticizing Hu Feng, "We Must Fight," was published, they continued to firmly believe that "I still can't think that there is anything wrong with Hu Feng's views." They could not hide their close connection with Geng Yong, but their contacts were all sneaky. They disguised themselves as revolutionaries, saying: "I want to be a revolutionary," wanting to leave the theater they called the "petty-bourgeois group," but wanting us to introduce him "to live in the countryside" to get close to the "soil," in order to confuse the public. In fact, this is the guise for them to establish a "stronghold" in the theater. Looking at it today, these conspiratorial activities of Geng Yong and the members who were pulled over by him were not only spreading reactionary literary and artistic ideas and influences in the theater, but also attempting to establish "strongholds," expand "strength," and conduct reactionary organizational activities to undermine the revolutionary group.

I have been temporarily transferred to Beijing to study. I believe that the theater will further expose the harm of the Hu Feng reactionary clique to the theater. In order to settle the accounts of Geng Yong's crimes, in order to purify the revolutionary ranks, I resolutely demand that the members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique hidden in the revolutionary groups be purged. We must resolutely and thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to ensure the smooth progress of the socialist revolutionary cause. (Attached picture)

    坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    不能让耗子过街
    施今墨
    自从在报纸上看见许多批判胡风的文章以后，我还以为胡风是个披着马克思列宁主义外衣、言行不一致的有思想错误的人。等到看了两次揭发的材料以后，我才知道胡风是人面兽心的反革命分子。
    胡风和他的反革命集团，有系统、有步骤地打入国家的各种组织，进行破坏、污蔑和挑拨中伤的罪恶活动，企图为他的主子的复辟阴谋铺路。但胡风已经忘记了人民觉悟的程度，太阳底下再也藏不住这个卑鄙无耻的东西了。因此我认为对他的处置不但是要撤销他的一切职务，而且必须严惩！我们不能让耗子过街！
    这一事件给我的教训是很大的。今后只有加强马克思列宁主义的学习，才能提高认识，提高警惕；特别要学习辩证唯物主义来澄清麻痹思想，认清敌我，使伪装的坏分子无机可乘；同时要紧密地团结中西医，努力合作，互相学习，共同为我们伟大的社会主义建设事业而奋斗！  （原载“健康报”）
    拥护依法惩办胡风的建议
    杨卫玉
    当报刊上最初提出胡风问题的时候，我只以为胡风思想模糊，观点不正确；哪知竟还大大不止如此。我看了五月十三日和二十四日“人民日报”揭发的关于胡风反革命集团的大批材料以后，才清楚地看出胡风的真正的丑恶面貌，肯定了胡风是一个披着马克思主义外衣，长期潜伏在革命阵营里，狂妄地组织了反革命集团，一贯地在发号施令，进行罪大恶极的反革命活动的反动分子。
    谁都清楚，中国人民是由于伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确的领导，才取得了一个又一个的胜利，解放了全国大陆，现在还要解放台湾，而且正在进行着更伟大幸福的社会主义的建设工作，正在做我们前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中所指出的文艺方针，是万分正确的。正由于这样正确的领导和指示，才使得我们的文艺工作在现在表现了
  “百花齐放，推陈出新”的欣欣向荣的气象。而胡风竟然丧心病狂地用抗拒、仇视的态度，污蔑为“被当作了‘图腾’的小册子”，而且还用“董事会”、“官方”、“马褂”、“老爷”、“豪绅”、“市侩”等字眼来咒骂和侮辱党和团结在党周围的进步作家。他这样地反动胡闹，真使我无比地愤怒，真有“是可忍，孰不可忍？”的感想。
    胡风还指挥他的反革命集团分子，混进党里，混进人民团体里，建立据点，探听情况，偷窃文件，用所谓“一种橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子” 的武器，“用集束手榴弹的战法”，“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，更可见他的反动毒辣达于极点，他已是人民的公敌，是全国人民所绝对不能容忍的了。
    胡风披着马克思主义的外衣，二十多年来一贯地在搞反革命的勾当，现在能够揭发出来，是全国人民在革命工作过程中的又一个伟大辉煌的胜利。
    我们要坚决保卫人民革命胜利的果实，绝对不能让这样的反革命分子再停留在我们的革命队伍里。
    我完全拥护撤销胡风一切职务，依法严厉惩办胡风的建议。我要求迅速地把这个敌人从人民中间清除出去，坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，纯洁我们革命队伍，以保证祖国伟大社会主义建设的胜利成功。  （原载“大公报”）
    必须刨根
    柳青
    我在病床上看到报上发表的一批又一批揭露胡风的材料和文章，那个肚里装着一副黑心肠的假笑的嘴脸，如同就在眼前。我凝视着窗外的蓝天、墙外的树丛和树丛那边高高耸起的建筑架，真想不到那个“主观战斗精神”的“大勇者”，“楔入”了我们这个“世界”，原来是这么回事！好一个“单纯的作家”、“文学工作的组织者”！胡风那些密信就是他的自供状，那里面充满了“黑话”，活活地描写出一个阴险的特务、反革命活动的组织者的丑恶面目！
    胡风在那些密信里表现了他的“真诚”，所以不管它们有多么长，人一口气就可以读完。而在他以前公开发表的一篇一篇文章、一本一本书里，全是假话，所以人们无论如何也读不下去。我以前没看完过胡风的一篇文章，他的“意见书”是头一次看完了。我的感觉是看了一个糊涂蛋写的东西，怎么也不能理解。为什么会从马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东同志的著作里只割下来一句两句话，加以歪曲，就妄想推翻马克思列宁主义的文艺政策呢？为什么解放以后出了多少书、演了多少戏、拍了多少电影，全不在他眼里呢？为什么他手下的那帮人写出的全是好的呢？为什么要求把作家团体的刊物都取消，而要恢复早已过时的各自为政的状态呢？为什么、为什么……好多的为什么！现在我们都从他写的密信里找到了回答。他是用“钻进肚皮去的战术”进行“挖心战”的。他根本不是什么“作家”，而是混在我们中间的反革命头子，连他的“意见书”里用的那一句两句从“马至斯、高、鲁、毛，现在苏联理论”割来的话，也是他的喽啰们给他找到“出处，页数”的。我们还能不提高警惕吗？
    一九四九年我到刚解放了的北京才认识胡风。第一次见面，他就那么“亲热”！他说他和我是没见过面的老朋友，接着，就和我谈起雪苇来了。他告诉我一大堆我连一点影子也不摸的雪苇的贴己事，问我和雪苇是不是常通信。因为是初次见面，我只好客气地面带笑容听他说完。当我告诉他我和雪苇只有点头握手之谊的时候，他有点尴尬了。我当时还以为这是一般的误会，后来，从一个同志嘴里知道胡风和雪苇的关系时，我才明白原来胡风把我当成他们那一伙伙的人了；因为雪苇写过一篇不正确地“捧”我的“种谷记”的文章，附在他的那本有着许多谎谬论点的“论文学的工农兵方向”后边。我看过那篇文章。我看出那里面隐藏着一个卑鄙、阴险的动机：企图拿我那本显然不成熟的习作，来抹煞另一位作家的作品，歪曲毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的精神。以后也还有没到过延安或在延安时间很短的个别同志问到我和雪苇的关系，我总有股说不出口的被污辱的感觉；因为我自信我自己思想上纵有许多缺点，同他们总是有区别的。
    现在想起来还像昨天的事情一样清晰——胡风曾经很“真诚”地告诉过我：雪苇搞错了，“种谷记”不是现实主义的书，而是客观主义的。他说：我被生活淹没了，因而看不见作者的“主观作用”。他摆出一副指导者的神气，说我应该“向生活搏斗”，
  “向生活冲击”。今天想起这些，不禁毛骨悚然。幸而我还有点思想上的抗毒素，没听这个“理论家”的鬼话，后来并不“向生活搏斗”，也不“向生活冲击”，而是向生活中遇到的困难和各式各样的敌人搏斗、冲击！我知道：一个初学写作者被生活淹没的事是有的，但那主要地绝不是什么“主观作用”的问题，而是马克思列宁主义的理论修养和对现实主义创作方法的掌握问题。人们！要紧紧地跟着党和人民前进，时刻提防上当啊！
    对于胡风，我们现在已经不像揭露他以前那样有那么多疑问了，他已经把他“自我扩张”得炸开了。对于他，我们只有一个问题还要彻底搞清楚，他同这个世纪的什么样的政治渣滓梦想着“未来”？这是最重要的，必须弄清楚；他和他的集团“拖累”了我们二十来年，“缠”了我们二十来年，倒底根子在什么地方呢？必须刨根！
    随时随地警惕隐蔽的伪装的敌人
    陈伯吹
    反党反人民的胡风及其集团的罪恶行为，在“人民日报”两次公布材料以后，真正是罪证如山，激起了全国人民的公愤，从心底里涌起对于这批自绝于党和人民的文艺界的败类和政治上的反革命分子的厌恶、唾弃，并且要求把他们清洗、严办。
    胡风及其指挥的集团一贯地从事扩大组织、建立据点的反动工作。在读了第二批材料以后，我猛然警觉地想起了一件事，应该把它揭露出来。
    一九五三年的上半年，“少年儿童出版社”在上海成立才几个月，就接到“新文艺出版社”转来一本叫做“桥和墙”的童话诗稿，作者是冀汸。彼此同样是出版机构，在兄弟单位之间转移稿件，本来是一件寻常的事；可是不寻常的是伴随这稿件而来的还附有由“新文艺出版社”出面写的一封奇怪的介绍信；记得有这么几句话（大意如此）：“……这稿件在我们社里已经决定采用。如果你社不用，送回我社，还是要出版的。……”看了这信叫人怪不舒服，感到有些要挟、甚至威胁的意味。
    当时我们只觉得这封信的提法实在不合适，却没有料想到这里面还包藏着一颗阴谋的“祸心”。
    这诗稿经过审读以后，一致认为是不好的童话诗：松散、堆砌、不适当地运用儿童所不能了解的象征手法。这诗里罗列着许多概念化的抽象名词，因此显得非常空泛。最大的缺点是：童话中的幻想的假象，不合乎事物本身的自然规律和自然关系，因此形象思维违反了逻辑思维；尤其是这篇童话的现实意义，也是含含糊糊地不明确的，至少是少年儿童不能体会的。
    于是稿件附着“审读意见”给退回去了。我心里还在想：“新文艺出版社”凭着什么决定要把这本诗稿出版？但是，“桥和墙”居然真的出版了。
    现在才知道胡风和他的集团对于建立活动据点，竭力扩大他们的影响这一阴谋手段，真是无孔不入，对儿童文学阵地也不肯放松。虽然这一次闯进来的猪鼻子给打回去了。
    革命敌人是诡计多端的，我们应该好好地吸取经验教训：认真严肃地对待工作，要杜绝敌人可以利用的一切空隙，不让他们有“开辟工作”的机会。随时随地警惕隐蔽的伪装的敌人！
    把胡风反革命集团彻底粉碎
    吕复
    胡风反动集团反党反人民反革命的阴谋破坏活动，不断地被揭露了，它那阴险、狡猾、恶劣、猖狂的对党和党所领导的文艺战线进攻的罪行，日益明显。我们被这样伪装革命而实际上是反革命的恶毒敌人所引起的愤恨，也更加不可抑止了。我完全拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，要求严厉惩治反革命头子胡风，继续揭露胡风反革命集团分子的罪行，把企图破坏革命事业的胡风反革命集团彻底粉碎。
    这里，我要揭露我所接触到的胡风反动集团分子耿庸的部分罪行。在一九五一年左右，耿庸曾经一度钻进我所工作的单位上海人民艺术剧院，在训练演员机构中担任文艺理论教学工作，在青年演员中散布反动的文艺思想；教学期满离开以后，他并未放松对剧院的毒害，他继续用卑劣的手段把甘心接受他反动文艺思想的个别分子拉了过去，同他经常保持联系，唆使他们污蔑党，污蔑党的文艺领导同志，并散布他的“‘阿Q正传’研究”中的错误言论。这被拉过去的脚色到处说：“你看耿庸说得多好！”当同志们讨厌这个耿庸的传声筒并同他争辩时，他却说“你们是迷信冯雪峰”。他骂共产党等于“一贯道”，平时对党团活动表示轻蔑。当青年们在黑板报上踊跃写稿表示以积极行动响应领导号召或展开批评时，他却以蔑视的态度，在黑板报旁边瞟了一眼，说：“永远的主题”。这类令人气愤的反动言词是很多的。那时，我们由于警惕性不高，只当做一般文艺思想问题和一般作风问题。我们对两个被他拉过去的分子做了一些驳斥，挽回了一些受他们欺骗的青年。但他们并不甘心被人批评，只在表面上好像“顺着”了点，而实际上仍继续作恶，有意打击党团员和积极青年，遇有团员因一时有了过错受到团组织的批评，他们就去谈话，假意给些
  “温暖”；群众有时对领导有些意见，他们就去谈话，假意表示“同情”。实质上他们是对革命团体进行破坏团结的活动，继续企图在背后扩充“实力”。当周扬同志批评胡风的发言“我们必须战斗”发表以后，他们继续坚决地认为“我到现在也不能认为胡风观点有什么错误”。他们无法隐讳同耿庸的密切联系，但他们的接触都是鬼鬼祟祟的。他们伪装革命，口头说：“我要做一个革命的人”，要离开他们称做“小资产阶级集团”的剧院，却要我们介绍他“到农村中去生活”，去接近“泥土”，借以迷惑视听。其实这就是他们在剧院建立
  “据点”的幌子。今天看来，耿庸以及被他拉过去的分子这些阴谋活动，不仅是在剧院散布反动文艺思想影响，同时也是企图建立“据点”，扩充“实力”，对革命团体进行破坏的反动组织活动。
    我暂被调到北京来学习了，相信剧院会更多地揭露胡风反动集团分子对剧院的危害。为了清算耿庸的罪行，为了纯洁革命队伍，我坚决要求把隐藏在革命团体中的胡风反革命集团分子清洗出去。必须坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，保证社会主义革命事业的顺利前进。（附图片）
    假投降  叶浅予作
