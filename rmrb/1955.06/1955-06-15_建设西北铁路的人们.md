The People Building the Northwest Railways
By our reporter Kang Weizhong

    In the past two years, all the employees of the newly built Northwest Railway, with their perseverance, have drilled through the Wushaoling Tunnel, crossed the Qinghe River, Longgou River, and Gulang River, and entered the grasslands, alkaline flats, and Gobi Desert, despite the complex geology and terrain, severe cold climate, and thin air. In completing their tasks, hundreds of advanced workers emerged, and many advanced deeds were created. To summarize and exchange the advanced experiences in surveying and design, construction, and other aspects over the past two years, the First Engineering Bureau of the New Railway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways recently held a representative conference of advanced workers in Lanzhou. One hundred and seventy-three advanced figures and representatives of forty advanced collective units participated in the conference.

    Among the advanced workers is Engineer Jiang Rizhu, who was responsible for the fixed measurement of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway from Dijiatai to Langpaoshui. This section of the line had been previously surveyed, and the Northwest Design Branch sent Engineer Jiang Rizhu to conduct preliminary surveys, preliminary designs, fixed measurements... The responsibility for these tasks was very heavy, because if any carelessness occurred during the fixed measurement and the line was wrongly determined, it would cause serious losses to the country. In the first few days of the preliminary survey of this line, Engineer Jiang Rizhu and his colleagues found that the line took a large bend from Dijiatai. Especially when they measured to Shigang Mountain, they felt that the terrain was increasingly complex: there were many mountain streams, some places required high filling of seventy meters, and some places required low excavation of thirty meters. More high bridges and long tunnels would need to be built on this line. Based on these circumstances, he proposed to revise the line, but the leaders of the surveying team and other engineering and technical personnel disagreed. Jiang Rizhu was not discouraged by this. On the contrary, he collected more information from various aspects to serve as the basis for modifying the line. He specifically found a 1:50,000 military topographic map, which showed that the line from Dijiatai via Zhongchanao Ridge to Langpaoshui was definitely shorter and straighter. The next day, Engineer Jiang set off to measure this line. He climbed mountains and ridges, measuring during the day and drawing and calculating at night. The measurement results proved that compared with the surveyed line, this line shortened the distance by forty-three kilometers, reduced four stations, and saved the country more than 30 million yuan in construction costs alone.

    Supervisory Engineer Zhu Zuyou is also a person who actively safeguards national interests. He found that a six-kilometer section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was close to the very high and steep Cuijia Cliff, which was very inconvenient for train operation. He suggested moving the original line six meters outward. The design department agreed to change the line but did not agree to move the line outward. They advocated cutting off a piece of the mountain to reduce the slope, believing that the soil at six meters outward was backfill and the roadbed might sink after rain. Engineer Zhu knew that if construction proceeded according to the proposal to cut off the mountain, the project would be large, and the country would increase its investment. To confirm that his opinion was correct, he took his measuring tools to Cuijia Cliff alone, measured the accurate elevation of the ground six meters outward from the line, and recorded it. After the rainy season, he went there again to measure it. Comparing it with the previous elevation record, it only sank three centimeters. This proved that the soil below was solid and could be used to build the roadbed. So he once again made his original suggestion to the design department. The design department agreed after seeing the reliable data. Engineer Zhu had put forward twenty suggestions for improving the design in the past two years, and calculating only the eight major ones saved the country 1.2 million yuan in investment.

    Driller Liu Xuqin, in the difficult pilot tunnel project of the Dieluo Gorge, realized that the quality of his work would affect the safety of train operation. Although he was smoked unconscious four or five times, he never interrupted his work. He researched a method to protect the drill rods, reduced the consumption rate of the drill rods, and enabled the mountain opening project to proceed smoothly. When people asked him why he could persevere, he said, "When I think of this glorious task, I am full of energy!"

    In 1954, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was built to the grasslands and Gobi Desert, and there was a shortage of water along the line. The First Engineering Bureau decided to adopt the Soviet construction method of assembling prefabricated bridge piers to solve the difficulty of building bridges and culverts. This was a new construction method, and engineering and technical personnel in China lacked experience. After accepting this task, Design Engineer Tang Jiayi consulted some Soviet books while using his brain to find solutions and finally solved various complex problems and smoothly mastered the production technology. As a result of the promotion of bridge pier assembly, the construction period of general small bridge projects was shortened from forty days to two to four days, and the number of workers was reduced from fifty or sixty to twenty, further guiding railway construction towards industrialization.

    During construction, employees put forward many suggestions for improving technology. The seven-member technical research group of the railway engineering tunnel team put forward 39 rationalization proposals in two tunnels of the Baotou-Tianshui Railway, and 21 of them were adopted. Among them, Li Weibi created a double-bottom sieve with universal promotion value based on the principle of villagers sifting flour, which increased work efficiency by three times and reduced the average cost of railway construction by more than 1,900 yuan per kilometer. The original design limit slope for the Zhangye to Jiuquan section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was 12‰, which had been approved by the Ministry of Railways. Later, Zhang Tongshun, a 53-year-old engineer, found that the line was unreasonable and boldly proposed changing the limit slope to 6‰. This suggestion has been adopted. It can accelerate the operation of locomotives, save the country 900,000 yuan annually, and double the tonnage of traction. Advanced worker Yang Yuguang improved the bottom-burning blasting method for igniting explosives, which not only guaranteed the personal safety of those opening mountains and setting off explosives, but also shortened the time to remove misfires by twenty minutes. This method has been promoted in various work areas. Ma Fuwa, a young Hui man, improved the operating method, reducing the monthly loss of small landslide cars used in Tunnel No. 3 of Wushaoling from eight to one, while increasing the efficiency from 23 trips to 32 trips per day.

    Engineer Dai Tongsan, winner of the "Glorious Railway Worker" medal issued by the Ministry of Railways, worked with workers to create "double-layer multi-faceted bottom-dropping method," "three-time excavation method," and "running-over-type inverted arch excavation method" in the difficult Wushaoling Tunnel construction, greatly accelerating the project progress. Once, during construction, he woke up in the middle of the night and heard wind and rain outside. He immediately got up to see if there were any problems with the workers' tents. He usually gets up early and goes to bed late, enduring hardship before enjoying comfort, living with the workers, chatting with them about their families, asking about their well-being, and never putting on the airs of an engineer. Zhuang Ruiying, who is about twenty years old, is an intern who just graduated from Tongji University in Shanghai and participated in the construction of the Northwest Railway. In the Gobi Desert, where the temperature is minus 17 degrees Celsius, she patiently explains drawings to workers and helps them improve their skills. Advanced foreman Ge Zhanghua patiently used steel wire to make structural models to teach workers when he led everyone to work on oval bridge and culvert projects. Within this small team, 35 people can now understand drawings, and 10 people can independently do technical work.

    Among the advanced workers are also party, trade union, Communist Youth League, and administrative leaders who are good at relying on the masses, carrying out labor competitions, and giving play to collective wisdom; veteran masters who actively care about the technical growth of workers and cultivate new forces; medical workers who care about the sick and wounded and actively promote advanced medical systems; labor protection workers who care about workers' safety and eliminate the danger of misfires; model policemen who care about and rely on the masses...

    The task of building new railways in the Northwest in 1955 is very arduous: the national investment has increased by 45% compared with the actual achievements in 1954; the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway line requires track laying to Zhangye, with a focus on construction to 588 kilometers; the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway line must complete key projects before laying track for 82 kilometers; in addition, there are the Lanzhou-Aganzhen railway branch line and the track-laying tasks of the Lanzhou hub station and special railway lines. Moreover, this year's railway line will pass through grasslands, alkaline flats, Gobi Desert, and churning soil areas. It is necessary to overcome the difficulties of "golden sand and silver water" (lack of sand and water). It is necessary to build double-track tunnels and span stone arch bridges that have never been built before. These people from the masses are determined to bring many advanced experiences to the masses, promote them universally, and ensure that they play a leading role in completing the task of building new railways in the Northwest in 1955.

    建设西北铁路的人们
    本报记者　康伟中
    过去两年，西北新建铁路的全体职工，在地质地形复杂、气候严寒、空气稀薄的情况下，以坚忍不拔的毅力凿穿了乌鞘岭大隧道，跨过了清河、龙沟和古浪河，进入了草滩、碱滩和戈壁滩。在完成任务中，涌现了数以百计的先进工作者，创造了许多先进事迹。为了总结和交流两年来在勘查设计、施工等方面的先进经验，最近，铁道部新建铁路工程总局第一工程局在兰州召开了先进工作者代表大会。参加代表大会的有一百七十三名先进人物，四十名先进集体单位的代表。
    在先进工作者的行列中，有负责对包兰铁路从狄家台到狼泡水这段工程进行定测的蒋日庶工程师。从狄家台到狼泡水这段线路过去已经草测过了，西北设计分局派蒋日庶工程师对这段路进行初测、初步设计、定测……这些工作的责任是很重大的，因为在定测时，稍有不慎，线路确定错了，就会给国家带来严重的损失。蒋日庶工程师和其他同志初测这条线路的头几天，发现了线路从狄家台起就绕着很大的弯子。特别当他们测量到石岗山以后，就越发感到地形复杂：山涧很多，有的地方要高填七十公尺，有的地方要低挖三十公尺，这条线上需要修筑的高桥和长隧道就更多。他根据这些情况，提出了改正线路的意见，但测量队的领导人员和其他工程技术人员不同意。蒋日庶并没有为此而灰心，相反的，更加从多方面搜集资料，以便作为修改线路的依据。他特地找到了一幅五万分之一的军用地形图，从地形看，肯定了从狄家台经中岔脑岭到狼泡水这段线路较近较直。第二天，蒋工程师就动身测量这条线路。他爬山越岭，白天测量，晚上绘图计算。测量结果证明：这条线路和草测线路相比，在距离上缩短了四十三公里，减少了四个车站，仅建筑费一项就给国家节省了三千多万元。
    监察工程师朱祖佑，也是一个积极维护国家利益的人。他发现兰新铁路有一段六公里多的线路紧靠着很高很陡的崔家崖山头，行车很不便利，便建议把原来的线路向外移六公尺。设计部门同意改线，但不同意线路向外移，而主张把山头削掉一块，减少坡度，认为向外移六公尺处的土质是虚填土，恐怕雨后路基会下沉。朱工程师知道要按照削掉山头的主张施工，工程很大，国家就要增加投资额。为了证实他的意见是对的，他独自拿着测量工具走到崔家崖，将线路向外移六公尺的地面测出准确的标高，记录下来，雨季过后，他又到这里测量一次，和前次标高的记录一对照，只下沉三公分。这证明下面是实土，完全可以修路基。于是他再一次向设计部门提出原来的建议。设计部门看见了可靠的资料就同意了。朱工程师两年中曾先后提出二十件改进设计的建议，仅以其中主要的八件计算，就为国家节约投资一百二十万元。
    钻工刘旭钦同志，在艰险的跌落峡打导坑工程中，认识到工作的好坏会影响到行车的安全，虽然被烟薰倒四、五次，也没有间断过工作。他研究出保护钻杆的方法，减少了钻杆的消耗率，使开山工程得以顺利进行。当人们问他为什么能坚持工作，他说：“我一想到这个光荣任务，全身都是劲！”
    一九五四年，兰新铁路修到了草滩、戈壁滩，沿线都缺水。第一工程局决定采用苏联桥墩成品拼装的施工方法，解决修筑桥涵的困难。这是一个新的施工方法，我国工程技术界人士还缺乏经验。设计工程师唐嘉衣接受了这项任务后，他一面参考一些苏联书籍，一面开动脑筋想办法，终于解决了 各种复杂问题，顺利地掌握了生产技术。由于桥墩台拼装的推行的结果，一般小桥工程的工期由四十天缩短为两天至四天，工人由五、六十人减少到二十人，进一步把铁路施工导向工厂化。
    在施工中，职工们提出了许多改进技术的建议。铁路工程隧道队的七人技术研究组，在宝天铁路的两个隧道中，提出合理化建议三十九件，被采纳了二十一件。其中李维壁根据老乡筛面的道理，创造了有普遍推广价值的双底筛，使工率提高三倍，每公里铁路造价平均降低一千九百多元。兰新铁路的张掖到酒泉段，原设计限制坡度为千分之十二，已经铁道部批准。后来，五十三岁的老工程师张同顺发现线路不合理，大胆地提出改限制坡度为千分之六的建议。这个建议已被采纳，它可以加速机车的运转，每年可为国家节约九十万元，牵引吨数将增加一倍。先进工作者杨玉光，改进了拉火底部燃烧爆炸法，不仅保证了开山放炮的人身安全，而且缩短了掏瞎炮时间二十分钟，这个办法已在各工区推广。回族青年马福娃，改进了操作方法，使在乌鞘岭三号隧道使用滑坡小平车每月的损失由八辆降低到一辆，而工率由每天二十三趟提高到三十二趟。
    铁道部颁发的“光荣的铁路工作者”奖章获得者戴统三工程师，在艰险的乌鞘岭隧道施工中，先后同工人一起创造了“双层多面落底法”、“三次掘进法”、“跑越式仰拱开挖法”等，大大加快了工程进度。在施工中，有一次，他半夜醒来，听到外面刮风和下雨，他马上起床去看看工人的帐篷有没有问题。他平日都是起早睡晚，吃苦在前、享乐在后；同工人生活在一起，同工人谈家常，问冷问暖，从不摆工程师的架子。二十岁左右的庄瑞英，是刚从上海同济大学毕业，参加西北铁路建设的实习生，她在摄氏零下十七度的冰天雪地的戈壁滩上，不厌其烦地给工人讲解图样，帮助工人提高技术。先进的领工员葛樟华，当他带领着大家作卵形桥涵工程时，他耐心地利用钢丝作结构模型，教工人学习，在这个小队内，已有三十五个人能看懂图，有十个人能单独作技术工作。
    在先进工作者的行列中，还有善于依靠群众、开展劳动竞赛、发挥集体智慧的党的、工会的、青年团的、行政的领导人员；有积极关心工人技术成长、培养新生力量的老师傅；有关心伤病员、积极推行先进的医疗制度的医务工作者；有关心工人安全、消灭瞎炮危险的劳动保护员；有关心群众，依靠群众的模范警士……
    一九五五年西北新建铁路的任务很繁重：国家投资比一九五四年完成的实绩增加了百分之四十五；兰新铁路线要求正线铺轨到张掖，重点施工到五百八十八公里；包兰铁路线要完成八十二公里铺轨前的重点工程；此外还有兰（州）阿（阿干镇）铁路支线，兰州枢纽站、专用铁路线的铺轨任务。而且今年的铁路线，还要经过草滩、碱滩、戈壁滩和翻浆地带。要克服“金砂、银水”（缺砂、缺水）的困难。要修筑过去从来没有做过的复线隧道和跨度石拱桥。这些来自群众中的人们，决心把许多先进经验带到群众中去，普遍推广，保证在完成一九五五年西北新建铁路的任务中起带头作用。
