    Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch – According to an Associated Press report, Parks and the other four U.S. Air Force personnel, who were deported by the government of the People's Republic of China for piloting U.S. military aircraft to intrude into Chinese airspace for harassment and provocation, said upon arriving in Hong Kong on May 31st that they received “very good treatment” from the Chinese side during their imprisonment in China.
    After examining their physical condition, the American medical officer, Nollcross, said that the airmen were in "very good health." He also said that Heiler, who sustained severe leg injuries from parachuting from the plane, received treatment in a Chinese hospital and appeared to be "well-cared for."

    被我国驱逐出境的四名美空军人员
    承认在我国受到宽大的待遇
    新华社一日讯　据美联社报道，被中华人民共和国政府驱逐出境的驾驶美国军用飞机侵入中国领空进行骚扰挑衅的帕克斯等四个美国空军人员在五月三十一日到达香港时说，他们在被中国监禁的期间受到中国方面“很好的待遇”。
    美国医官诺尔克罗斯在检查了他们的体格后说，这些空军人员的身体“很健康”。他并且说，因从飞机上跳伞下来而腿部受到重伤的海勒尔在中国医院得到了治疗，并且看来“医得很好”。
    这四个美国空军人员到达香港后，迎接他们的美国在香港的空军武官不准记者访问他们。他们很快就被送上美国军用飞机取道关岛前往檀香山。
    据美联社报道，这些空军人员在到达檀香山后将要受到美国军事官员的“讯问”，至少还要使他们和外界隔绝几天。
