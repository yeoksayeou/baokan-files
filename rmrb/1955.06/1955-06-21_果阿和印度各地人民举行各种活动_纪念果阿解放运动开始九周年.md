On this day, many buildings in Goa flew the flag of the Republic of India. Demonstrations were also held in Goa.

A mass rally was held by the public in Delhi, condemning the repressive measures taken by the Portuguese authorities against volunteers fighting for the liberation of Goa. According to the "Hindustan Standard," the Goa Liberation Front in Delhi demanded that the Indian government sever diplomatic relations with Portugal and take decisive measures to liberate the Indian territory forcibly occupied by the Portuguese colonialists. At a rally in Bombay attended by many people, Goan youth demanded the acceleration of Goa's liberation. Dr. T. V. Cunha, chairman of the Goa Action Committee, said that the Goa liberation movement, which began nine years ago, originated from the demands of the Goan people.

On the 18th, Portuguese police arrested Deshpande, a leader of the peaceful resistance movement volunteers who entered the Goa region at the Goa border, beat those who were with Deshpande, and drove them back into India.

On the same day, police in Daman, another Portuguese territory, opened fire on Indian police near the border.

    纪念果阿解放运动开始九周年
    新华社新德里二十日电据印度新闻处消息：果阿和印度各地人民十八日举行各种活动纪念果阿解放运动开始九周年。在这一天果阿的许多大楼都悬挂了印度共和国国旗。在果阿还举行了示威游行。
    德里公众举行了群众大会，大会谴责葡萄牙当局对争取果阿解放的志愿人员所采取的镇压措施。据“印度斯坦旗报”报道，德里市民的果阿解放阵线要求印度政府同葡萄牙断绝外交关系，并采取坚决的措施解放葡萄牙殖民者强占的印度领土。在孟买的一个有很多人参加的集会上，果阿青年要求加速解放果阿。果阿行动委员会主席特·维·库纳博士说，九年以前开始的果阿解放运动是发自果阿人民的要求。
    加尔各答的开业医生们也宣布了他们的决定：派遣医疗队前往果阿边境去医治被葡萄牙殖民者殴伤的示威者。
    果阿的葡萄牙当局对于要求解放果阿的志愿人员继续采取镇压的手段。葡萄牙警察十八日在果阿边境逮捕了一批进入果阿地区的和平抵抗运动志愿人员的领导人德希潘德，殴打了和德希潘德在一起的人，并把他们赶回印度境内。
    同日，另一葡萄牙属地第乌的警察开枪射击边境附近的印度警察。
