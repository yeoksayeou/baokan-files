    Since the peoples of China and India began to record history with written characters, they have recorded mutual exchanges, mutual assistance, cultural exchange, and the cherishing of friendship. There has never been a record of the peoples of China and India invading or hating each other. The history that the ancestors of the Chinese and Indian peoples left us clearly teaches us to be friendly and to have peace, not war. Today, the Indian Cultural Delegation comes to our country with a mission of peace and friendship. I welcome with great excitement the honored guests of our country—friends with a history of thousands of years of friendship.
    Our friends come from what people call the ancient Buddhist country. They have a long cultural history and a tradition of musical and dance art that is admirable. The performance of Indian artists in Beijing gave me a strong impression. Indian music and dance art is ancient and rich. It has its own unique style and is an excellent cultural heritage of mankind. These heritages have been gloriously inherited by the artists of the Indian people, and they have worked diligently in that ancient art garden to make it richer and more beautiful. This is the achievement of the Indian artists and the pride of the Indian people.
    With a feeling of friendship and learning, I watched two evenings of performances by Indian artists. Each program made me love it, fascinated me, and deeply intoxicated me with artistic infection. The choruses, solos, and instrumental performances by the musicians are so profound and melodious. At the quietest moments, they gently and emotionally lead people into fantasy. When the music rises to an impassioned climax, it is not just the rhythm and volume that increase sharply, but even more cleverly, the beat of the hand drum follows with heavy strikes, like ten thousand horses galloping. These moving melodies are very closely combined with skilled techniques. Like Mr. D. V. Paluskar's singing, it struck the heartstrings of the audience several times.
    The art of performing dances by Indian dance artists is even more unique. In particular, the Bharatanatyam dance performed by Ms. Indrani Rahman is not only skilled, but also profoundly expresses the character of Indian women. Her steps are unrestrained, her hand gestures are witty and agile, her waist is graceful, and she is full of rich and profound emotions. The group dances they perform are mostly light and slow dances, such as the folk dance performed by the Little Ballet Troupe. Those flower-like girls slowly unfold their charming and beautiful dance postures along with the beautiful music; they maturely perform the mood of "Spring of Girls."
    What I remember most are the two dance dramas, "The Gift" performed by Ms. Shirin Vajifdar and Mr. Krishna Kutty, and "The Art of Wise Living" performed by the Little Ballet Troupe. The former depicts "good triumphing over evil," and the latter depicts "if beasts can cherish great friendship so much, then what is so strange about intelligent humans cherishing friendship?" The contents of these two dance dramas are very thoughtful; the plot is moving, the form is complete, the music is characteristic, and the acting is superb. Because all aspects of it are closely and rigorously combined, it shows even more that Indian dance art has its traditional superiority; it also shows how Indian artists cherish it and bravely defend its superiority. This is the pride of Indian artists. From their entire song and dance program, I further realized that the Indian people are as honest, brave, witty, and intelligent as the people of our country. They cherish friendship, freedom, happiness, and peace. To be honest, I am proud that my motherland has such a great neighboring friend.
    Any valuable stage art, or art performed not on stage but in squares, no matter what advantages it possesses, must be performed by talented performing artists to show its advantages. Then I think Ms. Shirin Vajifdar and Mr. Krishna Kutty have done this very successfully. The genius dance drama actor Mr. Krishna Kutty shows his amazing talent even more in the detailed techniques of his Kathakali dance. He is good at using his magical hands and feet, his clever eyes, and his infinitely changing face to successfully perform scenes such as the self-respecting "King," the curved and flat "Highway," the gloomy "Hell," and a person's "Loneliness" in just over two minutes, all of which are exciting and moving. The characteristics of his performance are concise movements, clear rhythm, clear purpose, and rich emotions. Each plot is woven into different pictures with dance postures, and each picture is a "beautiful" picture of dance.
    The successful performances of the artists of the Indian Cultural Delegation are due, on the one hand, to their inheritance of the tradition of a long cultural history, and on the other hand, to the result of the long-term artistic creation work of each artist. As a Chinese artist engaged in drama work, I sincerely congratulate their achievements and wish them the same success in their performances throughout our country. I believe that through their performances, the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people will be further consolidated. (Attached picture)

    具有悠久传统的印度歌舞
    中国人民解放军总政治部文艺工作团团长　陈其通
    自从中印两国人民开始用文字来纪载历史的时候，就纪载着互相往来，互相帮助，互相交流文化，互相珍视友谊，从没有纪载过中印两国人民互相侵略和仇视。中印两国人民的祖先留给我们的历史，很清楚地教导我们要友好，要和平，不要战争。今天，印度文化代表团带着和平和友谊的使命来到我国，我以十分激动的心情欢迎我们国家的贵宾——有几千年友谊历史的朋友。
    我们的朋友来自人们称之为古老的佛教之国，他们有悠久的文化历史，有使人敬佩的音乐舞蹈艺术传统。印度艺术家们在北京的演出，给了我强烈的印象。印度的音乐和舞蹈艺术是古老而又丰富的，它有着特有的风格，是人类优秀的文化遗产。这些遗产被印度人民的艺术家光荣地继承了下来，并在那古老的艺术园地里勤劳地工作，使它更加丰富、更加美丽，这是印度艺术家们的功绩，也是印度人民的骄傲。
    我带着友谊和学习的心情，连看了印度艺术家们演出的两个晚会。每个节目都使我喜爱、入迷，深深地沉醉在艺术感染之中。音乐家们表演的合唱、独唱，以及器乐演奏，是那样的深厚而又悠畅，轻声之处，婉转抒情地把人慢慢地引入幻想；当音乐声进行到昂扬之处，不仅是韵律，声量疾转，更巧妙的是敲打的手鼓声随之重击，有如万马奔腾。这些动人的曲调，和那得心应手的熟练技巧结合得十分紧密，像歌唱家德·维·帕卢斯卡尔先生的演唱，几次都是深深地打中了观众的心弦。
    印度舞蹈艺术家们表演舞蹈的艺术，更是有独特的造诣。特别是印德拉尼·拉赫曼女士表演的巴拉达那蒂亚舞，不仅技巧熟练，而且深刻地表现了印度女性的性格。她步伐奔放，手式机智而又灵巧，腰肢婀娜，并富有丰富、深厚的感情。他们表演的集体舞蹈，多是轻盈慢舞，如小巴蕾舞利用表演的民间舞，那些鲜花般的少女，随着优美的音乐，慢慢地展开了妩媚而美妙的舞姿；她们成熟地表演了“少女之春”的心情。
    最使我难忘的是希林·瓦吉弗达尔女士和克里希纳·库蒂先生合演的“赏赐”，和小巴蕾舞剧团演出的“智慧生活的艺术”的两个舞剧。前者是描写“善良战胜了邪恶”，后者是描写“如果兽类还能如此珍视伟大的友谊，那么，聪明的人类珍视友谊又有什么奇怪呢？”这两个舞剧的内容都是很有思想性的；情节动人，形式完整，音乐有特色，演技高超。由于它各方面结合得周密而又严整，更显示出印度的舞蹈艺术有其传统的优越性；同时也看出印度的艺术家们，是在如何地珍视它，并勇敢地保卫着它的优越性。这是印度艺术家们的骄傲。我从他们整个的歌舞节目中，更进一步地认识到印度人民和我国人民一样的诚实，勇敢，机智，聪明。他们珍视友谊，珍视自由幸福，珍视和平。说真的，我为我的祖国有这样伟大的邻友而感到自豪。
    任何宝贵的舞台艺术，或非舞台广场表演的艺术，无论其具备着怎样的优越性，总是要通过天才的表演艺术家的表演，才能显示出它的优越性。那么我认为希林·瓦吉弗达尔女士和克里希纳·库蒂先生是十分成功地做到了这一点。天才的舞剧演员克里希纳·库蒂先生，在他表演的卡塔卡利舞的细致技巧里，更显示出他惊人的才能。他善于用他那神妙的手脚，灵利的双眼，变化无穷的面部，在短短的两分多钟内成功地表演了自尊的“国王”，弯曲而又平坦的“公路”，阴森森的“地狱”，一个人的“孤独”等情景，无不精采动人。他表演的特点是动作简练，节奏鲜明，目的明确，情感丰富。每一个情节都是用舞姿织成各种不同的画面，每一个画面又是一幅舞的“美”的图画。
    印度文化代表团艺术家们成功的演出，一方面是由于他们继承了悠久文化历史的传统，同时也是由于他们每个艺术家长期地从事艺术创作劳动的结果。作为一个从事戏剧工作的中国艺术工作者，我衷心地祝贺他们的成就，祝贺他们在我国各地的演出取得同样的成功。我相信通过他们的演出，将促使中印两国人民的友谊更加巩固。（附图片）
