    Ministry of Heavy Industry System Plans to Save Over 90 Million Yuan in Construction Funds
    The Ministry of Heavy Industry system plans to save more than 90 million yuan in capital construction funds this year.
    Based on the spirit of overall economy, the Ministry of Heavy Industry has decided to reduce 120,000 square meters from the 900,000 square meters of non-productive building area that has not yet started construction, and to reduce the construction cost of the remaining 700,000+ square meters to below the new cost standards. For the 300,000+ square meters of non-productive construction projects that have already started construction in May and June of this year, it has also been decided to reduce costs by about 10 percent by reducing equipment and decoration. This will save the country more than 50 million yuan in funds. In addition, appropriate reductions have also been made in areas such as tool and instrument purchase costs and cadre training costs.
    The Ministry of Heavy Industry has stipulated different cost targets for the construction of dormitories, offices, schools, hospitals, warehouses, and other buildings of its enterprises in the Northeast, North China, and areas south of the Yangtze River, based on different conditions such as climate. These targets are all lower than the standards stipulated by the central government. It is also stipulated that dormitory buildings in these areas should generally be built as bungalows. Therefore, the construction cost of dormitory buildings for enterprises south of the Yangtze River only needs to be 25 to 35 yuan per square meter. A construction unit in the Central and Southern region originally planned to build more than 150,000 square meters of apartment dormitories with a cost of 80 yuan per square meter, but now it has been decided to rebuild these apartment buildings into bungalows with a cost of 35 yuan per square meter. This measure can save nearly 7 million yuan in funds.
    When studying various projects item by item, the Ministry of Heavy Industry found that the cost of some temporary projects serving capital construction was as high as 30 to 60 yuan per square meter, which was even higher than some of the current cost targets. Therefore, these projects can be fully utilized. Some of the originally planned new hospitals and schools are not urgently needed for construction. Therefore, after reducing 120,000 square meters of construction, it will not affect the lives, work, and study of employees.
    The Ministry of Heavy Industry has also appropriately reduced the cost or reduced the construction area of welfare buildings in new factories without changing the original design principles. For example, the area of the workshop living room in a factory in Northeast China was too large, totaling more than 4,000 square meters; the gatehouse of some new factories was 230 square meters in size; and some new factories had corridors leading from the office to the workshop. These construction projects have been rationally reduced or the cost has been appropriately reduced.
    When formulating this savings plan, the Ministry of Heavy Industry sent cadres to inspect the waste situation of key construction units, and the ministry and its affiliated enterprises combined top-down accounting and repeatedly revised the original plan.

### 重工业部系统计划节约建设资金九千多万

    重工业部系统计划节约建设资金九千多万
    重工业部系统计划今年在基本建设中节省九千多万元的资金。
    重工业部根据全面节约精神，决定在未动工的九十万平方公尺的非生产性建筑面积中，削减十二万平方公尺，并把其余七十多万平方公尺的建筑降低到新的造价标准以下；在今年五六月间已经开工的三十多万平方公尺非生产性建筑工程中，也决定从减少设备、装饰等方面降低造价约百分之十。这样就能给国家节省五千多万元的资金。此外，如工具、仪器购置费、干部培养费等方面，也作了适当的削减。
    重工业部对本部在东北、华北和长江以南地区企业的宿舍、办公室、学校、医院、仓库等建筑，都根据气候等不同条件，规定了不同的造价指标。这些指标都低于中央所规定的标准。并规定这些地区的宿舍建筑，一般都盖平房。因此，长江以南各企业的宿舍建筑，每平方公尺只需要二十五元到三十五元的造价。中南地区一个建设单位，原计划建造的十五万多平方公尺楼房宿舍，规定每平方公尺的造价是八十元，现在决定把这些楼房建筑，改建每平方公尺造价三十五元的平房。这一项措施可节省近七百万元的资金。
    重工业部在逐项研究各项工程时，发现有些为基本建设服务的临时工程，每平方公尺造价高达三十元到六十元，比现在规定的某些造价指标还高，因此这些工程完全可以充分利用。原计划新建的医院和学校，也有一些是不迫切需要建筑的。因此削减十二万平方公尺建筑后，并不影响职工的生活、工作和学习。
    重工业部对新建厂的福利建筑，在不改变原来设计的原则下，也适当地降低了造价或削减了建筑面积。例如东北一个工厂的车间生活室面积过大，共有四千多平方公尺；有的新建厂的传达室有二百三十平方公尺大；有的新建厂办公室通到车间的路还有走廊。这些建设的项目，都进行了合理的削减，或是适当地降低了造价。
    重工业部制定这个节约计划时，曾派出干部检查各重点建设单位的浪费情况，部里和所属企业上下结合算细账，并对原计划进行了反复地修改。
