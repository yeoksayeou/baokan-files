Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 18th: The International Preparatory Committee of the World Mothers' Congress announced in a communique on the 18th that seventy countries are preparing to participate in the Congress and have selected representative delegations.

The International Preparatory Committee announced that, due to some unforeseen circumstances, the World Mothers' Congress, originally planned to be held in Paris, will be held in Lausanne, Switzerland, from July 7th to 10th.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the French government had agreed to hold the World Mothers' Congress in Paris on July 10th. However, recently, French Foreign Minister Pinay informed the Preparatory Committee of the World Mothers' Congress that the French government could not guarantee that entry visas would be issued to all representatives from other countries. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee of the Congress wrote to French Prime Minister Faure, requesting him to change the French government's attitude on this issue. After reiterating the purpose of convening the Congress, the Preparatory Committee pointed out that the French government's decision is contrary to its repeated assurances to promote the holding of international talks.

    世界母亲大会改在瑞士的洛桑举行
    新华社柏林十八日电　世界母亲大会国际筹备委员会十八日发表公报说：有七十个国家正在准备参加这次大会，并选出了有代表性的代表团。
    国际筹备委员会宣布，由于没有预料到的一些情况，原先计划在巴黎召开的世界母亲大会将在七月七日到十日在瑞士的洛桑召开。
    据新华社讯　法国政府曾同意世界母亲大会七月十日在巴黎举行。但是，最近法国外交部长比内通知世界母亲大会筹备委员会说，法国政府不能够保证把入境签证发给其他国家的所有代表。因此，大会筹备委员会写信给法国总理富尔，要求他改变法国政府在这一问题上所采取的态度。大会筹备委员会在重申召开大会的目的后指出，法国政府的这一决定是同它一再保证促进举行国际会谈的精神相违背的。
