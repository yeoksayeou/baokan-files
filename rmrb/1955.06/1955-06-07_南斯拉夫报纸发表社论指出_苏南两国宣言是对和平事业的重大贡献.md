    Yugoslavian Newspapers Publish Editorials Pointing Out that the Sino-Soviet Joint Declaration is a Major Contribution to the Cause of Peace

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Sino-Soviet Joint Government Declaration continues to be the focus of attention for Yugoslavian newspapers.

    "Borba's" editorial on the 5th stated: "The Sino-Soviet talks have undoubtedly greatly promoted the further development of the world in a positive direction." The newspaper said: The talks not only made many contributions to the interests of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, but also made great contributions to broader international interests, because what the world needs most is a solid and lasting peace, and such peace can only be guaranteed through the active cooperation of all countries. The newspaper emphasized: "We will devote all our strength and sincerely commit ourselves to establishing the kind of relationship with the Soviet Union that is clearly stated in the Sino-Soviet Joint Declaration... We hope that Sino-Soviet relations will develop successfully according to this clearly defined and highly democratic program. At the same time, in accordance with the principles already announced and the spirit of the decisions already made, we will quickly begin to concretely resolve outstanding issues, thoroughly adjust relations, and develop good cooperation."

    "NIN" also published an editorial entitled "The Belgrade Declaration and International Peace," stating: No matter from which aspect one looks at the Sino-Soviet Joint Declaration, it is a major historical document. The editorial said: "The Sino-Soviet Joint Government Declaration has established the democratic principles that should and can lay the foundation for international cooperation. Therefore, this declaration becomes an important international document, every line of which is a major contribution to the current main task—maintaining the cause of world peace." (Attached picture)

    据新华社讯　苏南两国政府宣言仍然是南斯拉夫报纸的注意中心。
    “战斗报”五日的社论说：“南苏会谈毫无疑问地大大促进世界朝积极方向进一步发展。”报纸说：会谈不仅为南、苏两国的利益作出了许多贡献，而且对更加广泛的国际利益有很大贡献，因为全世界最需要的是稳固的和持久的和平，而只有通过一切国家的积极合作才能够保证这样的和平。报纸着重指出：“我们将以自己的全部力量，真诚地致力于同苏联建立南苏联合宣言中明确阐明了的那种关系……我们希望：南苏关系将根据这个含义明确、十分民主的纲领成功地发展。同时，还根据已经宣布的原则和已经作出的决定的精神迅速开始具体解决悬而未决的问题，彻底地调整关系和发展良好的合作。”
    “宁报”也发表题为“贝尔格莱德宣言和国际和平”的社论说：无论从那一方面来看苏南联合宣言，它都是一件重大的历史性文件。社论说：“南苏两国政府宣言确定了应当并且可能奠定国际合作的民主原则。因此，这个宣言成为一个重要的国际文件，这个文件的每一行都是对当前主要的任务——维护世界和平事业——的重大的贡献。”（附图片）
