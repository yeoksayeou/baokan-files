    Supply More New Books to Soldiers
    To the Editor:
    We are an engineering unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed on Hainan Island. In addition to our busy military life, we also squeeze out time to read books. However, due to inconvenient transportation, it is difficult for us to buy our favorite reading materials at any time. One afternoon in April this year, a Xinhua Bookstore salesperson came to our island with new books, and many comrades took out their long-saved money to buy books. Books such as "Elementary Political Textbook," the new edition of "How to Be a Communist Party Member," "Water Margin," "Journey to the West," and "Folk Tales" were all welcomed by everyone. However, after all, too few people bought new books this time, and more comrades were working on construction sites, so when they went to buy them the next day, the salesperson had already left.
    We are eager to see books. We hope that Xinhua Bookstore will do everything possible to supply more books to the soldiers.

    把更多的新书供应给战士们编辑同志：
    我们是驻在海南岛上的一支中国人民解放军的工兵部队。我们除了每天过着紧张的军事生活外，还要挤出时间阅读书籍。但是由于交通不便，我们很难随时买到自己喜爱的读物。今年四月间的一个下午，新华书店的营业员带着新书来到了我们的海岛上，很多同志都把自己长期积蓄的钱拿出来买了书。“初级政治课本”、新版的“怎样做一个共产党员”、“水浒”、“西游记”、“民间故事”等书，都是大家欢迎的。但是这次买到新书的人毕竟太少了，更多的同志因为在工地工作，到第二天去买的时候，营业员早就回去了。
    我们渴望着看到书籍。希望新华书店尽一切办法把更多的书籍供应给战士们。
            中国人民解放军工兵某部战士　王家春
