    This newspaper reports that the Agricultural Bank of China began issuing poor peasant cooperative fund loans in the second quarter of this year to help poor peasants (including individual newly-risen middle peasants with difficulties) solve the problem of raising funds for membership fees when joining agricultural production cooperatives. This is to consolidate the unity between poor and middle peasants, implement the principle of mutual benefit, inspire and encourage middle peasants to actively invest in the cooperatives, and further promote the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives.
    The total amount of this loan this year is more than 138 million yuan. Branches of the Agricultural Bank of China in various regions will issue the loans in conjunction with the current rectification and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives. The principle of loan issuance is to base it on the amount of membership fees that each poor peasant (including individual newly-risen middle peasants with difficulties) member should pay and the degree of their capital shortage: lend more to those with greater shortages, less to those with smaller shortages, and no loans to those without shortages. The loan term is set at five years, and the loan interest rate is preferentially set at a monthly rate of four per mille.

    中国农业银行开始发放贫农合作基金贷款
    本报讯 中国农业银行从今年第二季度起，开始发放贫农合作基金贷款，帮助贫农（包括个别有困难的新中农）解决加入农业生产合作社时筹措入社费用的困难，巩固贫中农之间的团结，贯彻双方互利原则，启发和鼓励中农积极向社内投资，从而进一步促进农业生产合作社的巩固和发展。
    今年这项贷款的总额为一亿三千八百多万元，中国农业银行各地分支机构将结合目前农业生产合作社的整顿和巩固工作进行发放。贷款的发放原则，是根据各户贫农（包括个别有困难的新中农）社员应缴付入社费用的数额及其资金缺少的程度，多缺的多贷，少缺的少贷，不缺的不贷。贷款的期限定为五年，贷款利率按月息四厘优待。
