    Shandong and Shanxi jointly uncovered a hidden Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization

    (Our Newspaper) Jinan, Shandong - The public security organs of Shandong and Shanxi Provinces, working in close coordination and after thorough investigation, uncovered a hidden "Kuomintang Zibo District Work Committee Office" Chiang Kai-shek special agent espionage organization, and lawfully arrested 23 criminals, including the special agents Wang Letian and Song Shao-yi.

    The ringleader of this group of special agents, Wang Letian, joined the "Central Statistics Bureau" (CC Clique) special agent organization before liberation and served as secretary of the "First District Party Department of the Zibo Mining Area Special Party Headquarters" of the Chiang Kai-shek party, as well as a director of the "National Federation of Trade Unions," consistently engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. After the liberation of Zibo, Wang fled to Taiwan and received special agent training at the Chiang Kai-shek "Training Class for Personnel Sent to the Mainland." He was then dispatched to the mainland by the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization, the "Kuomintang Central Reform Committee." The task given to him by the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization was to gather Chiang Kai-shek remnants, develop a special agent organization, infiltrate our industrial and mining enterprises to carry out sabotage, probe for our military and economic intelligence, and organize armed riots. After sneaking into the mainland in April 1950, the criminal Wang hid in Nanjing and successively established connections with remaining counter-revolutionaries lurking in Nanjing, such as Li Shijie, Song Shao-yi, Gao Si-kong, and Huang Shao-feng, using "Huachang Department Store" as the code name for the "Kuomintang Zibo District Work Committee Office" to actively carry out special agent espionage activities.

    This group of criminals established connections with counter-revolutionaries, enemy and puppet officers, and Chiang Kai-shek party members lurking in various places. They successively recruited the counter-revolutionaries Wei Chuanzhen and Sun Ning'ao, who had already infiltrated our Zibo Mine, the counter-revolutionary Li Muping of Taihu Coal Mine, and the Chiang Kai-shek armed special agents and ruffians Zhang Lixun and Zhang Ligong, who had fled to Benxi in Northeast China.

    After establishing connections, this group of counter-revolutionary special agent spies actively collected our military, political, and economic intelligence, carried out sabotage, and organized armed forces, wantonly plotting to cooperate with the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea and to take over our industrial and mining enterprises. The special agents Yan Xiangkai, Sun Ning'ao, Zhang Kuixiang, Wei Chuanzhen, and others, who were lurking in the Zibo mining area, actively collected intelligence on the politics, economy, and workers' lives of our Boshan, Hongshan, and Xihe mines. The criminal Li Muping collected economic intelligence on our Taihu Coal Mine. This group of special agent spies sent a total of 27 pieces of important intelligence to the Hong Kong Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization through Wang Letian and Song Shao-yi. This group of special agents also tried every possible means to establish a radio station to strengthen their special agent activities. The special agent Cui Shuhe, who infiltrated one of our factories, constantly spread rumors and engaged in sabotage, touting the strength of US imperialism, and caused seven accidents, resulting in great losses to state property. Li Muping, who infiltrated our Taihu Coal Mine, incited counter-revolutionaries to engage in slowdowns and spread rumors and sabotage.

    When establishing their organization and carrying out sabotage activities, this group of special agent spies adopted extremely covert and cunning methods in accordance with the instructions and plans of the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization. When they infiltrated our industrial and mining enterprises, they changed their names and fabricated their histories. The special agent Wei Chuanzhen, who was lurking in the Zibo Mining Bureau, feigned enthusiasm and, after gaining the trust of his leaders, stole more than a dozen top-secret documents from our Zibo Coal Mine. During our suppression of counter-revolutionaries, some of this group of special agents, in order to conceal their criminal activities, secretly moved from Nanjing and other places to Taiyuan, Shanxi, in 1951. After infiltrating Taiyuan, the criminals Song Shao-yi and others used the establishment of a "Sulfur Mine Production Cooperative" as a cover to continue their activities. They also conspired to carry out "party building" and organize so-called "reserve forces" in an attempt to lie dormant for a long time.

    After indictment by the procuratorial organs and rigorous interrogation by the Shandong Provincial Higher People's Court, these criminals were sentenced to death or imprisonment in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." The sentences were carried out immediately after a public trial held in Zibo City on June 21.

    山东山西共同破获一个隐蔽的蒋贼特务组织
    本报讯　山东省和山西省公安机关密切配合，经过周密的侦察，破获了一个隐蔽的“国民党淄博区工作委员办事处”的蒋贼特务间谍组织，依法逮捕了特务王乐天、宋绍夷等二十三名罪犯。
    这批特务的首犯王乐天，解放前即参加“中统”特务组织，并曾充任蒋党“淄博矿区特别党部第一区党部”书记，“全国总工会”理事，一贯从事反革命活动。淄博解放后，王犯逃往台湾，在蒋贼
  “派往大陆工作人员讲习班”受特务训练后，由蒋贼特务机关“国民党中央改造委员会”派遣潜入大陆。蒋贼特务机关交给该犯的任务是，纠集蒋贼残余，发展特务组织，混入我工矿企业进行破坏，刺探我军事、经济等情报，组织武装暴乱。该犯自一九五○年四月潜入大陆后，即隐匿于南京，先后和潜伏在南京的残余反革命分子李世杰、宋绍夷、高思孔、黄少峰等建立联系，以“华昌百货号”作为“国民党淄博区工作委员办事处”的代号，积极进行特务间谍活动。
    这批罪犯和潜伏在各地的反革命分子、敌伪军官、蒋党党徒建立了联系。他们先后网罗了已经混入我淄博矿内的反革命分子魏传珍、孙凝鳌，太湖煤矿的反革命分子李慕平，逃往东北本溪的蒋贼武装特务、兵痞张立勋、张立功等。
    这批反革命特务间谍分子在建立联系后，便积极地搜集我国军事、政治、经济情报，进行破坏，并组织武装，狂妄地图谋配合美帝国主义的侵朝战争，接收我国工矿企业。潜伏在淄博矿区的特务阎相凯、孙凝鳌、张奎祥、魏传珍等积极搜集我博山、洪山、西河等矿的政治、经济、工人生活等情报。李犯慕平则搜集我太湖煤矿的经济情报。这伙特务间谍分子，先后经过王乐天、宋绍夷之手，向香港蒋贼特务机关共发出重要情报二十七件。这批特务并千方百计地计谋建立电台，加强特务活动。潜入我某厂的特务崔淑和曾不断地造谣破坏，吹嘘美帝国主义实力，并制造七次事故，使国家财产遭受很大损失。混入我太湖煤矿的李慕平煽动反革命分子，进行怠工和造谣破坏等活动。
    这批特务间谍在建立组织、进行破坏活动时，根据蒋贼特务机关的指示和策划采取了极为隐蔽、狡猾的手段。他们在打入我工矿企业时，改名换姓，假造历史。潜伏在淄博矿务局的特务分子魏传珍伪装积极，骗得领导信任后，盗窃了我淄博煤矿绝密文件十余份。当我镇压反革命运动中，这批特务中的一部分人，为了隐蔽他们的罪恶活动，于一九五一年由南京等地向山西太原潜移。潜入太原后，宋绍夷等犯以开设“硫磺矿生产合作社”为掩护，继续进行活动。他们并阴谋进行“建党”和组织所谓“后备力量”，企图长期潜伏。
    这些罪犯经过检察机关的起诉和山东省高级人民法院的严密审讯后，根据“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”分别判处各犯以死刑和徒刑，并于六月二十一日在淄博市召开公审大会后立即执行。
