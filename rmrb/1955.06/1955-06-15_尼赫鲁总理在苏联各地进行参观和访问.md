Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: According to TASS news, after leaving Moscow, Indian Prime Minister Nehru and his entourage visited Stalingrad, Simferopol, Yalta, and other places. On the 13th, they arrived in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. They were warmly welcomed by local governments, social activists, and tens of thousands of Soviet people along the way.

Prime Minister Nehru and his party arrived in Stalingrad on the 11th and visited the Stalingrad Tsaritsyn-Stalingrad Defense Museum, the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, and the Stalingrad Tractor Factory. Prime Minister Nehru wrote in the guestbook of the Stalingrad Museum: "I have come here to pay tribute to this indomitable and victorious Stalingrad." When Prime Minister Nehru visited the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, the workers on the construction site warmly welcomed him and presented him with a photo album of the construction site.

On the morning of the 12th, Prime Minister Nehru flew from Stalingrad to Simferopol, and then from there to the southern coast of Crimea. He took the sailing yacht "Angara" to Yalta. On the way, a speedboat from the Soviet "Artek" Pioneer camp caught up. The children on the speedboat shouted in unison: "Prime Minister Nehru, we invite you to the Artek Pioneer camp!" So, the sailboat docked, and Prime Minister Nehru and others, surrounded by children with flowers, visited this Pioneer camp known as "Paradise". The children presented Prime Minister Nehru with a large oil painting depicting a panoramic view of Artek and placed a wreath of roses on his daughter, Mrs. Gandhi. Prime Minister Nehru presented the Pioneers with a small sandalwood stick and said to the children: I will never forget this meeting, and I will convey your greetings to the Indian children. I hope that when you grow up and the Indian children also come of age, you will cooperate with each other.

After arriving in Yalta on the 12th, Prime Minister Nehru and his party visited Livadia, the largest trade union sanatorium in Crimea. The hall where the historic Yalta Conference was held attracted the Indian Prime Minister's attention. The guests also visited the main palaces and talked with the recuperating workers. Subsequently, Prime Minister Nehru and his party went to Miskhot to visit an agricultural workers' sanatorium and a lumber workers' sanatorium.
