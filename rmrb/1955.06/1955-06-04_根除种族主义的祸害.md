    Eradicating the Scourge of Racism
    Cui Qi
    The Bandung Conference, while condemning colonialism, also condemned racial discrimination and racism. The final communiqu√© of the conference pointed out that racial discrimination and racism are gross violations of human rights, a denial of human dignity and civilization, and a tool for suppressing culture. Therefore, the conference called on the people of Asia and Africa to fight for the eradication of this scourge.
    A look at the history and current situation of racial discrimination and racism, as well as their "theories," shows that racial discrimination and racism have always been integral parts of the national oppression policies of colonial countries.
    The formation of racist theories to justify national oppression took place in the 16th and 17th centuries, during the period of primitive accumulation of European capitalism. At that time, countries with advanced production technology in Western Europe began to carry out brutal colonial plunder against the people of economically backward regions. In order to create a "scientific" cover for this plunder, bourgeois theorists representing the interests of Western European colonialists created a reactionary racist theory, using the different characteristics of Europeans and non-Europeans in external form to divide them into "superior races" and "inferior races," thereby attempting to make people believe that it was natural for the "superior races" of Europe to oppress the "inferior races" outside of Europe. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the bourgeoisie of the colonial countries that occupied colonies especially felt the need for theories about "racial inequality" to justify their conquest and enslavement of the colonies. Thus, the 18th-century bourgeois theorist Monboddo published a "theory" saying: different races on Earth have different origins, and not all races are truly human. "There is a human ladder with different levels, and we should place the various nationalities and families we know on different levels of this ladder." In the second half of the 19th century and the 20th century, due to the development of the plunder policies of imperialist countries and the development of their expansionism aimed at aggression against other nations, the so-called theory of white racial superiority became popular. According to this "theory," the various colored races, which account for the majority of the world's population, are destined to be ruled by the so-called white race. It can be seen that the development of racist theory has always been complementary to the development of colonialism.
    The anti-scientific nature of this racist theory is obvious. Scientists tell us that the external physiological differences between different races, such as skin color and hair shape, are merely formed due to long-term adaptation to different geographical conditions and natural environments. As the Soviet philosopher G. Alexandrov pointed out in "A History of the Doctrine of Social Development": "None of the representatives of race 'theory' has ever proved, nor can they prove, what influence the racial characteristics they point out have on the political, economic, and spiritual life of various nations. There is not a trace of scientific realm in all the works of racists." In fact, behind the bourgeois racist theory lies the entire bloody history of Western colonialists' plunder, exploitation, enslavement, and massacre of colonial people.
    When Western colonialists first arrived in the Americas, they slandered the Native Americans as not human but "bipeds in the forest" based on this racist theory. The colonists carried out large-scale annihilation of the Native Americans, and even offered rewards for buying Native American skulls, with the aim of eliminating them in order to seize their homes and lands. Later, only when the colonists felt that exploiting the labor of living people was more beneficial to them did the massacres decrease, but the brutal persecution of the Native Americans never stopped. Therefore, when Europeans began to conquer the Americas, there were originally more than three million Native Americans living in what is now the United States, but now there are only about three hundred thousand. They are confined to "reservations" and treated as objects of appreciation, facing the danger of extinction.
    Under the reactionary banner of racism, black people have suffered the most cruel infringements and enslavement by colonialists. After the discovery of the Americas, Western colonialists developed the appalling "trade" of trafficking in African blacks. Tens of thousands of African blacks were transported to the Americas to serve as slaves for white colonists. They died in batches on ships, on plantations, and in mines. From 1680 to 1775 alone, Britain transported more than three million black people from Africa to the American colonies, and the number of ships transporting black people reached a maximum of one hundred and ninety-two. This "trade" was one of the important sources of capital accumulation in the early days of capitalist development. The barbaric crimes of European colonial countries in conquering the African continent after the 19th century were also committed under the banner of racism. And even now, racial discrimination and racism are still a crude tool for Western colonialists to continue to rule and exploit the African people. The French colonialists' suppression of the national independence movements of the North African people, the British colonialists' massacres of the Central African people, and the South African white rulers' crazy discrimination and persecution of black people and other people of color are all masked by the reactionary bourgeois racism.
    As for the United States, its history of capitalist development is almost inseparable from racial discrimination and oppression. The process of westward expansion of the colonists in North America was the process of expelling and eliminating Native Americans, and the exploitation of slave labor of black people and other people of color has always been an important condition for the development of American capitalism. Although the American "Declaration of Independence" declares that "all men are created equal," American society divides people into several classes according to different races and discriminates against them. Although black slaves were legally emancipated after the Civil War, the racial persecution suffered by black people in the United States continues. In today's America, the vast majority of the fifteen million black people still live in slavery. Their civil rights are deprived and violated. Their right to work and labor treatment are discriminated against. Black people can only engage in the lowest-paid labor, and even if they do the same work as white people, they receive 30% less pay. Their living conditions are appalling, and large numbers of black people are crowded into designated segregated areas. Their right to education and culture is ignored. Their personality is insulted, and even their lives are not guaranteed. They live day and night in the terror and threat of lynchings. According to incomplete statistics, from 1880 to 1947, six thousand black people were lynched in the United States. According to the materials in "American Imperialism," a book published after the war by American economist Victor Perlo, American monopoly capitalists obtain about four billion US dollars in excess profits from the exploitation of black people every year.
    Racist propaganda has always been very popular in the United States. As early as 1900, Senator Beveridge, representing the most aggressive financial capital group in the United States, said to Congress: "Without the United States, the world would fall into barbarism and darkness... God has specially designated Americans from many races to finally realize the regeneration of the world." Then-U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt also used the "Yellow Peril" and the "Black Peril" to slander the people of Asia and Africa, and used this to incite Americans to carry out large-scale foreign expansion, especially expansion to the Far East. People know that later, Hitler frantically practiced racial discrimination and promoted racism in Germany. He described Aryans as a race destined to rule the world. This reactionary propaganda was once an important tool for German fascists to launch wars of aggression and promote their plan to enslave the world. It should be said that Hitler's racism was learned from the United States.
    After World War II, the United States became the colonial country with the greatest ambition for aggression, and thus also became the place where racist propaganda was most rampant. American bourgeois sociologists, neo-Malthusians, and hired hacks wearing various trademarks have all joined in the shouts of American racial superiority. For example, Huntington said in his book "The Sources of Culture" that the climate of the United States produced the American "superman," which has a "natural leading role" in the world. Yale University professor Furcht said that the United States is the bearer of "super culture," and all parts of the world must accept the "American way of life." Professors Meijer and Pandel openly advocated reducing the population of "inferior races." They said that eliminating Orientals is the "civilizing mission of the white race," "the Japanese population must be reduced by two-thirds," and "Indians are only good when they are dead"... These irrational, misanthropic arguments reflect the arrogant ambitions of the American monopoly capitalist group to establish world hegemony, and prepare the American people ideologically for the US imperialists to drive them to carry out aggression and launch new colonial wars involving large-scale massacres of mankind. As the American political commentator Montague said: "Our American economic system, along with the internal conflicts, spiritual impasse, war and poverty that it produces, is the main source of racism. Racial bigotry - this is the social method of launching wars of aggression."
    Racial discrimination is fundamentally contrary to the United Nations Charter. However, Western colonial countries, led by the United States, have consistently obstructed and opposed the United Nations from taking measures to stop racial discrimination. When the Seventh UN General Assembly was held in 1952, fifteen countries, including India, suggested condemning racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa, but the colonial countries, represented by the United States, openly expressed their opposition. On May 20, 1954, the former chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Wiley, claimed that the United States could not ratify the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. This proves that the US imperialists regard the implementation of racial discrimination and racial persecution as an important means for them to incite national hatred and facilitate their colonial rule and expansion, and therefore stubbornly refuse to give it up.
    However, the current era is different. Today, in the vast territory of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, in the places where 900 million people live, colonialism has been completely eradicated, and national oppression has been eliminated forever. In these countries, advocating racial discrimination is considered a sinful act, just like advocating war. And all over the world, demanding national independence and freedom, opposing colonialism, advocating equality of all nations, and opposing the racial discrimination policies of imperialism have also become the common aspirations of the people of all countries. They are waging a common struggle to realize these aspirations. The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung by twenty-nine countries in Asia and Africa and its achievements reflect the upsurge of this irresistible historical trend. The people of millions of oppressed nations are increasingly awakening and are determined to eradicate the scourge of racial discrimination and racism. The death knell for the imperialist colonial system and racism is ringing louder.
