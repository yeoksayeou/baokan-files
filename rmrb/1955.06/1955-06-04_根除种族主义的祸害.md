    Eradicating the Scourge of Racism
    Cui Qi
    The Bandung Conference, while condemning colonialism, also condemned racial discrimination and racism. The final communiqué of the conference pointed out that racial discrimination and racism are gross violations of human rights, a denial of human dignity and civilization, and a tool for suppressing culture. Therefore, the conference called on the people of Asia and Africa to fight for the eradication of this scourge.
    A look at the history and current situation of racial discrimination and racism, as well as their "theories," shows that racial discrimination and racism have always been integral parts of the national oppression policies of colonial countries.
    The formation of racist theories to justify national oppression took place in the 16th and 17th centuries, during the period of primitive accumulation of European capitalism. At that time, countries with advanced production technology in Western Europe began to carry out brutal colonial plunder against the people of economically backward regions. In order to create a "scientific" cover for this plunder, bourgeois theorists representing the interests of Western European colonialists created a reactionary racist theory, using the different characteristics of Europeans and non-Europeans in external form to divide them into "superior races" and "inferior races," thereby attempting to make people believe that it was natural for the "superior races" of Europe to oppress the "inferior races" outside of Europe. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the bourgeoisie of the colonial countries that occupied colonies especially felt the need for theories about "racial inequality" to justify their conquest and enslavement of the colonies. Thus, the 18th-century bourgeois theorist Monboddo published a "theory" saying: different races on Earth have different origins, and not all races are truly human. "There is a human ladder with different levels, and we should place the various nationalities and families we know on different levels of this ladder." In the second half of the 19th century and the 20th century, due to the development of the plunder policies of imperialist countries and the development of their expansionism aimed at aggression against other nations, the so-called theory of white racial superiority became popular. According to this "theory," the various colored races, which account for the majority of the world's population, are destined to be ruled by the so-called white race. It can be seen that the development of racist theory has always been complementary to the development of colonialism.
    The anti-scientific nature of this racist theory is obvious. Scientists tell us that the external physiological differences between different races, such as skin color and hair shape, are merely formed due to long-term adaptation to different geographical conditions and natural environments. As the Soviet philosopher G. Alexandrov pointed out in "A History of the Doctrine of Social Development": "None of the representatives of race 'theory' has ever proved, nor can they prove, what influence the racial characteristics they point out have on the political, economic, and spiritual life of various nations. There is not a trace of scientific realm in all the works of racists." In fact, behind the bourgeois racist theory lies the entire bloody history of Western colonialists' plunder, exploitation, enslavement, and massacre of colonial people.
    When Western colonialists first arrived in the Americas, they slandered the Native Americans as not human but "bipeds in the forest" based on this racist theory. The colonists carried out large-scale annihilation of the Native Americans, and even offered rewards for buying Native American skulls, with the aim of eliminating them in order to seize their homes and lands. Later, only when the colonists felt that exploiting the labor of living people was more beneficial to them did the massacres decrease, but the brutal persecution of the Native Americans never stopped. Therefore, when Europeans began to conquer the Americas, there were originally more than three million Native Americans living in what is now the United States, but now there are only about three hundred thousand. They are confined to "reservations" and treated as objects of appreciation, facing the danger of extinction.
    Under the reactionary banner of racism, black people have suffered the most cruel infringements and enslavement by colonialists. After the discovery of the Americas, Western colonialists developed the appalling "trade" of trafficking in African blacks. Tens of thousands of African blacks were transported to the Americas to serve as slaves for white colonists. They died in batches on ships, on plantations, and in mines. From 1680 to 1775 alone, Britain transported more than three million black people from Africa to the American colonies, and the number of ships transporting black people reached a maximum of one hundred and ninety-two. This "trade" was one of the important sources of capital accumulation in the early days of capitalist development. The barbaric crimes of European colonial countries in conquering the African continent after the 19th century were also committed under the banner of racism. And even now, racial discrimination and racism are still a crude tool for Western colonialists to continue to rule and exploit the African people. The French colonialists' suppression of the national independence movements of the North African people, the British colonialists' massacres of the Central African people, and the South African white rulers' crazy discrimination and persecution of black people and other people of color are all masked by the reactionary bourgeois racism.
    As for the United States, its history of capitalist development is almost inseparable from racial discrimination and oppression. The process of westward expansion of the colonists in North America was the process of expelling and eliminating Native Americans, and the exploitation of slave labor of black people and other people of color has always been an important condition for the development of American capitalism. Although the American "Declaration of Independence" declares that "all men are created equal," American society divides people into several classes according to different races and discriminates against them. Although black slaves were legally emancipated after the Civil War, the racial persecution suffered by black people in the United States continues. In today's America, the vast majority of the fifteen million black people still live in slavery. Their civil rights are deprived and violated. Their right to work and labor treatment are discriminated against. Black people can only engage in the lowest-paid labor, and even if they do the same work as white people, they receive 30% less pay. Their living conditions are appalling, and large numbers of black people are crowded into designated segregated areas. Their right to education and culture is ignored. Their personality is insulted, and even their lives are not guaranteed. They live day and night in the terror and threat of lynchings. According to incomplete statistics, from 1880 to 1947, six thousand black people were lynched in the United States. According to the materials in "American Imperialism," a book published after the war by American economist Victor Perlo, American monopoly capitalists obtain about four billion US dollars in excess profits from the exploitation of black people every year.
    Racist propaganda has always been very popular in the United States. As early as 1900, Senator Beveridge, representing the most aggressive financial capital group in the United States, said to Congress: "Without the United States, the world would fall into barbarism and darkness... God has specially designated Americans from many races to finally realize the regeneration of the world." Then-U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt also used the "Yellow Peril" and the "Black Peril" to slander the people of Asia and Africa, and used this to incite Americans to carry out large-scale foreign expansion, especially expansion to the Far East. People know that later, Hitler frantically practiced racial discrimination and promoted racism in Germany. He described Aryans as a race destined to rule the world. This reactionary propaganda was once an important tool for German fascists to launch wars of aggression and promote their plan to enslave the world. It should be said that Hitler's racism was learned from the United States.
    After World War II, the United States became the colonial country with the greatest ambition for aggression, and thus also became the place where racist propaganda was most rampant. American bourgeois sociologists, neo-Malthusians, and hired hacks wearing various trademarks have all joined in the shouts of American racial superiority. For example, Huntington said in his book "The Sources of Culture" that the climate of the United States produced the American "superman," which has a "natural leading role" in the world. Yale University professor Furcht said that the United States is the bearer of "super culture," and all parts of the world must accept the "American way of life." Professors Meijer and Pandel openly advocated reducing the population of "inferior races." They said that eliminating Orientals is the "civilizing mission of the white race," "the Japanese population must be reduced by two-thirds," and "Indians are only good when they are dead"... These irrational, misanthropic arguments reflect the arrogant ambitions of the American monopoly capitalist group to establish world hegemony, and prepare the American people ideologically for the US imperialists to drive them to carry out aggression and launch new colonial wars involving large-scale massacres of mankind. As the American political commentator Montague said: "Our American economic system, along with the internal conflicts, spiritual impasse, war and poverty that it produces, is the main source of racism. Racial bigotry - this is the social method of launching wars of aggression."
    Racial discrimination is fundamentally contrary to the United Nations Charter. However, Western colonial countries, led by the United States, have consistently obstructed and opposed the United Nations from taking measures to stop racial discrimination. When the Seventh UN General Assembly was held in 1952, fifteen countries, including India, suggested condemning racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa, but the colonial countries, represented by the United States, openly expressed their opposition. On May 20, 1954, the former chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Wiley, claimed that the United States could not ratify the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. This proves that the US imperialists regard the implementation of racial discrimination and racial persecution as an important means for them to incite national hatred and facilitate their colonial rule and expansion, and therefore stubbornly refuse to give it up.
    However, the current era is different. Today, in the vast territory of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, in the places where 900 million people live, colonialism has been completely eradicated, and national oppression has been eliminated forever. In these countries, advocating racial discrimination is considered a sinful act, just like advocating war. And all over the world, demanding national independence and freedom, opposing colonialism, advocating equality of all nations, and opposing the racial discrimination policies of imperialism have also become the common aspirations of the people of all countries. They are waging a common struggle to realize these aspirations. The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung by twenty-nine countries in Asia and Africa and its achievements reflect the upsurge of this irresistible historical trend. The people of millions of oppressed nations are increasingly awakening and are determined to eradicate the scourge of racial discrimination and racism. The death knell for the imperialist colonial system and racism is ringing louder.

    根除种族主义的祸害
    崔奇
    万隆会议在谴责殖民主义的同时，也谴责了种族歧视和种族主义。会议最后公报指出，种族歧视和种族主义是对人权的粗暴侵犯，是对人类尊严和文明的否定，是压制文化的工具。因此会议号召亚非地区人民为根除这种祸害而斗争。
    我们对种族歧视和种族主义的历史、现状及其 “理论”作一些观察，就会看到，种族歧视和种族主义一直是殖民国家的民族压迫政策的组成部分。
    为民族压迫作辩护的种族主义理论的形成，是在十六—十七世纪，也就是欧洲资本主义的原始积累时期，那时西欧生产技术先进国家开始向经济落后地区人民进行残酷的殖民掠夺。为了替这种掠夺制造“科学”的掩饰物，代表西欧殖民者利益的资产阶级理论家就创立一种反动的种族主义理论，利用欧洲人和欧洲以外的人在外部形态上的不同特征，把他们分为“高等种族”和“低等种族”，从而企图使人相信，欧洲的“高等种族”压榨欧洲以外的“低等种族”仿佛是当然的事。在十七—十八世纪，占有殖民地的殖民国家的资产阶级，特别感到需要关于“种族不平等”的理论，以辩护他们对殖民地的征服和奴役。于是，十八世纪的资产阶级理论家孟纳尔斯就曾发表一种“理论”说：地球上的不同种族有着不同的来源，并不是所有的种族都是真正的人，“有一个具有不同等级的人类梯子，应该把我们所知道的各民族和家族放在这个梯子的不同等级上”。到了十九世纪下半期和二十世纪，由于帝国主义国家掠夺政策的发展，由于它们以侵略别的民族为目的的扩张主义的发展，所谓白色种族优越论获得了流行。按照这种“理论”的说法，占世界人口大多数的各种有色种族注定要受所谓白色种族的统治。由此可见，种族主义理论的发展始终是和殖民主义的发展相辅而行的。
    这种种族主义理论的反科学性，是显而易见的。科学家告诉我们，不同种族的外部生理上的不同特征，如皮肤颜色和毛发形状等等，仅仅是由于长期适应不同的地理条件和自然环境而形成的。正如苏联哲学家格·亚历山大洛夫在“论社会发展学说史”中所指出的：“人种‘理论’的代表们中间从来就没有一个人曾经证明，也不可能证明他们所指出的人种特征对各民族的政治、经济和精神生活究竟有什么影响。在种族主义者的所有著作中没有丝毫科学的境界。”事实上，在资产阶级种族主义理论的背后，隐藏着的就是西方殖民者对殖民地人民进行掠夺、剥削、奴役和屠杀的全部血腥历史。
    当西方殖民者最初到达美洲时，他们就根据这种种族主义理论，诬蔑美洲的印第安人不算人，而是“森林中的两足动物”。殖民者对印第安人实行了大规模的剿杀，甚至悬赏收购印第安人的头盖，其目的是要消灭他们，以夺取他们的家园和土地。后来仅仅是当殖民者感到剥削活人的劳动力对自己更有利时，屠杀才减少了，但是对印第安人的野蛮迫害始终没有停止过。因此，当欧洲人开始征服美洲时，在今日美国地区内本来居住着三百多万印第安人，现在却只有约三十万人了。他们被圈在“专住区”里被作为观赏的对象，正面临灭种的危险。
    在种族主义的反动旗帜下，黑人遭到殖民主义者最残酷的侵害和奴役。美洲发现以后，西方殖民者发展了贩卖非洲黑人的骇人听闻的“贸易”，成万的非洲黑人被运到美洲去充当白人殖民者的奴隶，他们成批地死在船上，死在种植园和矿井中。仅仅从一六八○年到一七七五年，英国就从非洲运走了三百多万黑人到美洲殖民地，贩运黑人的船只最多时达一百九十二只。这种“贸易”是资本主义发展早期的资本积累的重要来源之一。十九世纪以后，欧洲殖民国家征服非洲大陆的野蛮罪行，也是在种族主义的旗帜下干出来的。而且直到现在，种族歧视和种族主义仍旧是西方殖民者继续统治和剥削非洲人民的一种粗暴的工具。法国殖民者对北非人民民族独立运动的镇压、英国殖民者对中非人民的屠杀，以及南非白人统治者对黑人和其他有色人民的疯狂歧视和迫害，无一不以资产阶级反动的种族主义作为掩饰。
    至于美国，它的资本主义发展历史几乎是同种族歧视和压迫分不开的。北美的殖民者向西扩展的过程，就是驱逐和消灭印第安人的过程，而对黑人和其他有色人种的奴隶劳动的剥削，一直是美国资本主义发展的一个重要的条件。尽管美国“独立宣言”宣布“所有的人天生就是平等的”，但是美国社会却按照不同的种族把人分成几等，加以歧视。尽管南北战争后在法律上解放了黑奴，但是黑人在美国所受的种族迫害还在继续。在今天的美国，一千五百万黑人的绝大多数仍然生活在奴隶状况中。他们的公民权利被剥夺，被侵犯。他们的工作权利和劳动待遇受到歧视。黑人只能从事报酬最低的劳动，而且即使和白人做同一工作，所得报酬也要低百分之三十以上。他们的居住条件恶劣不堪，大批黑人拥挤在指定的隔离区。他们的教育权利和文化受到漠视。他们的人格受到侮辱，甚至生命也没有保障，日日夜夜生活在私刑虐杀的恐怖和威胁中。据不完全统计，从一八八○年到一九四七年，美国私刑虐杀的黑人就有六千人。而根据美国经济学家维克托·佩洛在战后出版的“美帝国主义”一书的材料，美国垄断资本家每年从压榨黑人方面得到约四十亿美元的超额利润。
    种族主义的宣传在美国一直是非常流行的。早在一九○○年，代表美国最富于侵略性的金融资本集团的参议员贝维利治向国会演说：“如果没有美国，世界会落入野蛮和黑暗状态。……上帝从许多
  种族中，特别指定美国人，要它在最后实现世界的再生。”当时的美国总统西奥多尔·罗斯福也曾以“黄祸”和“黑祸”来诬蔑亚非人民，并借此煽动美国人实行大规模的对外扩张，特别是向远东的扩张。人们知道，后来，希特勒曾在德国疯狂地实行种族歧视和宣传种族主义，他把亚利安人说成是注定要统治世界的种族。这种反动宣传曾经是德国法西斯发动侵略战争和推行其奴役世界计划的重要工具。应该说，希特勒的种族主义是从美国学来的。
    第二次世界大战后，美国成了侵略野心最大的殖民国家，从而也成为种族主义宣传最猖狂的地方了。美国资产阶级的社会学家，新马尔萨斯主义者，以及戴着各种商标的雇佣文丐们，都参加了美国种族优越论的叫喊。例如，汉丁顿在“文化之源”一书中说，美国的气候产生了美国“超人”，它对世界“有天然的领导作用”。耶鲁大学教授费尔查特说，美国是“超级文化”的担当者，世界各地必须接受“美国生活方式”。迈杰尔和潘得尔教授更公然主张削减“劣等民族”的人口。他们说，消灭东方人是“白种人的文明使命”，“日本人口必须削减三分之二”，“印度人只有死时才是好人”……。这些丧失理性的憎恨人类的论调，反映了美国垄断资本集团建立世界霸权的狂妄野心，并为美帝国主义者驱使美国人民进行侵略，发动大规模屠杀人类的新的殖民战争作思想准备。正如美国政论家蒙塔古所说：“我们美国的经济制度，连同它本身产生的内部冲突，精神上的走头无路，战争与贫困，都是种族主义产生的主要根源。种族褊狭性——这是发动侵略战争的社会方法。”
      种族歧视是根本违背联合国宪章的。但是，以美国为首的西方殖民国家却一贯阻挠和反对联合国采取措施制止种族歧视。当一九五二年第七届联合国大会举行时，印度等十五国曾建议谴责南非联邦的种族歧视，以美国为代表的殖民国家公然表示反对。一九五四年五月二十日，美国前参议院外交委员会主席维利并声称，美国不能批准联合国关于禁止消灭种族的公约。这正证明，美帝国主义者是把实行种族歧视和种族迫害，作为他们煽动民族憎恨，便利他们进行殖民主义统治和扩张的重要手段，因此顽固地不肯放弃它。
    但是，现在的时代已经不同了。今天，在苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的广阔的国土上，在九亿人民居住的地方，已经彻底地铲除了殖民主义，永远地消灭了民族压迫。在这些国家里，宣扬种族歧视和宣扬战争一样，被认为是一种罪恶的行为。而在全世界，要求民族独立和自由，反对殖民主义，主张一切民族平等，反对帝国主义的种族歧视政策，也已经成为各国人民的共同愿望。他们正为实现这些愿望而进行着共同的斗争。亚洲和非洲二十九个国家在万隆所召开的亚非会议及其成果，就反映了这种不可抗拒的历史潮流的高涨。千百万受压迫民族的人民日益觉醒起来，一定要根除种族歧视和种族主义的祸害。帝国主义殖民制度和种族主义的丧钟敲得更响了。
