Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd – Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, who is visiting China, held a press conference in Beijing on the afternoon of June 2nd. More than 50 reporters from China, Indonesia, and other countries in Beijing attended the press conference. Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo issued a written statement at the meeting and also answered some questions raised by the reporters.

Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo said that his visit to China and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Indonesia "are mutually beneficial and have greatly strengthened our relations."

The Prime Minister said he firmly believes that the Chinese people need peace above all else.
"My belief is based on the warm welcome we received everywhere in China after arriving in China, and the expression of this desire for peace by the young and old people we talked to in the streets and factories throughout China.

"I think, in particular, this impression is based on the fact that the Chinese people are enthusiastically engaged in the work of rebuilding and revitalizing their country. And the reconstruction and revitalization of any country in the world requires peace, because without peace, the people of any country cannot strive for the prosperity of their country."

In order to develop the existing friendly relations between Indonesia and China, he suggested exchanging visitors, cultural delegations, students, professors, and possibly technical personnel. He also said: "One of the most important things is that we must understand each other's languages. By doing so, we will understand each other better."

In response to a question about economic relations, Ali Sastroamidjojo said: "Economic relations have been discussed in both Jakarta and Beijing. You know that we are very willing to expand our trade relations with China." He pointed out that this matter must be carefully drafted. He said he believes that trade relations with China will grow in the future.

When asked for his opinion on steps to ease international tensions and ensure world peace, the Indonesian Prime Minister said: "If we can act in the spirit of the Bandung Conference on this matter, then I think we will make great progress on this issue."

He pointed out: Since the Bandung Conference, the prospect of strengthening friendship between Asian and African countries is good. "Because twenty-nine countries support the joint communique we call the Bandung Declaration, we believe this spirit will spread throughout the world and take root in people's hearts."

When asked about his impressions during his stay in China, Ali Sastroamidjojo said: "I am truly excited because I see the spirit of the Chinese people working together to rebuild and construct their country and to change their backward state and catch up." He also said: "I visited some of your factories, and I have the impression that you are well organized and that your direction of modernization is correct."

The Prime Minister said that he was very impressed that the director of a textile factory he visited was a woman. "We in Indonesia and Indonesian women are also proud to hear that Chinese women are equal to men."

He said that China's education has made great progress. Schools are well equipped, and scientific research is constantly expanding and improving. "That is why I mentioned the possibility of exchanging students and professors with Indonesia, because I firmly believe we can benefit from this exchange."

He said that the education of China's ethnic minorities gives one an understanding of China's policies towards them. "This education, which promotes unity without neglecting the characteristics of your country's ethnic minorities, has impressed me very much."

Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd – The following is the full text of the written statement issued by Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo to the press at the press conference:

On the eve of my departure from Beijing, I would like to first express my gratitude to the Government of the People's Republic of China for its very warm and thoughtful reception.

Unfortunately, I cannot stay in China for a longer period to see more deeply how the people are working to build their country. However, during my short visit, I have gained a vivid impression of the great efforts of the Chinese people and their determination to get rid of the backward state they have suffered for so long.

During my stay in Beijing, I had the opportunity to discuss issues of common concern with Premier Zhou Enlai, including global issues and issues closely related to China-Indonesia relations. Our talks took place in an extremely harmonious atmosphere, and this exchange of views was extremely beneficial to both of our countries.

When I return to Indonesia, I will carry with me the conviction that the Chinese people need peace above all else in order to raise their living standards and build their country. When I return home, I will also carry with me the Chinese people's desire for friendship with the Indonesian people.

Therefore, my visit to this great country, although short, has been extremely fruitful.

    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理举行记者招待会
    并向报界发表书面声明
    新华社二日讯　应邀来我国访问的印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约六月二日下午在北京举行了记者招待会。参加招待会的有中国、印度尼西亚和各国在北京的记者五十多人。阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理在会上发表了书面声明，还回答了记者们提出的一些问题。
    阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理说，他来中国的访问和周恩来总理去印度尼西亚的访问，“是互相有益的，并且大大加强了我们的关系”。
    总理说，他深信，中国人民需要和平甚于一切。
  “我的信念的根据是我们在到中国以后在中国各处都受到了热情招待，是我们在中国各处的街头和工厂里所交谈的青年人和老年人都表示了这种和平的愿望。
    “我认为，尤其是，这种印象的根据是中国人民都热烈地从事于重建和复兴他们的国家的工作。而世界上任何国家的重建和复兴都需要和平，因为没有和平，任何国家的人民都不能为他们的国家的繁荣而努力。”
    为了发展印度尼西亚和中国之间的现存友好关系，他建议互派访问者、文化代表团、学生、教授，可能还有技术人员。他又说：“最重要的事情之一是必须互相懂得对方的语言。这样做，我们将彼此更为了解。”
    在答复关于经济关系的问题时，阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约说：“在雅加达和北京都讨论了经济关系。你们知道，我们是非常愿意扩大我们同中国的贸易关系的。”他指出这事必须仔细地加以拟定。他说他相信今后同中国的贸易关系将会增长。
    有人问到他对缓和国际紧张局势和保障世界和平的步骤的意见，这位印度尼西亚总理说：“如果在这件事上我们能照万隆会议的精神行事的话，那末我认为我们将在这个问题上获得很大的进展。”
    他指出：自从万隆会议以来，加强亚非国家之间的友谊的前景是很好的。“由于二十九个国家支持我们称之为万隆宣言的联合公报，我们相信这种精神将扩展到全世界，并在人民的心里生根。”
    有人问到他在中国停留期间得到的印象，阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约说：“我真是兴奋极了，因为我看到中国人民共同努力重新建立和建设他们的国家和改变他们的落后状态迎头赶上的精神。”他又说：“我参观了您们的一些工厂，我有这样的印象：您们组织得很好，您们的现代化的方向是正确的。”
    总理说，他参观过的一个纺织厂的厂长是一位妇女，他对这一点印象很深。“我们在印度尼西亚的人和印度尼西亚妇女也听到中国妇女同男子是平等的，感到很自豪。”
    他说，中国的教育事业已经取得很大的进展。学校都有良好的设备，科学研究工作正在不断扩展和改进。“这就是我所以提到有可能和印度尼西亚交换学生和教授的原因，因为我深信我们可以从这种交换中得到好处。”
    他说，中国少数民族的教育事业使人对于中国对他们的政策有了一个了解。“这种在不忽视贵国各少数民族的特点的情况下促进团结的教育，给我的印象非常好。”
    新华社二日讯　印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约在记者招待会上对报界发表的书面声明。全文如下：
    在我离开北京的前夕，我愿意首先向十分热情而周到地招待我的中华人民共和国政府表示感激。
    不幸，我不能够在中国多停一个时期，来更深入地看看人民努力建设他们国家的情况。但是，在我短短的访问期间，我已经对中国人民的伟大的努力和他们要摆脱他们长期遭受的落后状态的决心，有了鲜明的印象。
    在我逗留北京期间，我曾经有机会同周恩来总理商谈共同关心的问题，包括世界性问题以及同中国—印度尼西亚关系有密切联系的问题。我们的会谈是在极其融洽的气氛中进行的，这种意见交换对我们两国都是极为有益的。
    在我回到印度尼西亚去的时候，我将带着一个信念：为了达到提高自己的生活水平和建设自己的国家的目的，中国人民需要和平胜于一切。在我回国的时候，我也将带着中国人民对印度尼西亚人民友好的愿望。
    因此，我在这个伟大国家的访问，虽然为期很短，却是有极大成果的。
