The beautiful art of Indian dance
Chen Jinqing, Vice Principal of the Beijing Dance School

This time, cultural envoys from India—the Indian Cultural Delegation—flew over the snowy Himalayas, bringing us not only the deep friendship of the Indian people, but also the wonderful art performances of our great neighbor.

It is a pleasure and a blessing to have the opportunity to talk with so many outstanding Indian artists and appreciate their art.

"The song of friendship resounds in all directions,
Long live Sino-Indian friendship!
Ah...
We are warriors of peace,
Against wars of aggression..."

From the passionate and heroic songs of the Indian singers, we seemed to hear the heartfelt voices of the more than 300 million Indian people who love peace and freedom, powerfully resonating with our emotions like the waves of the ocean. Indian music, whether vocal or instrumental performances, is rich in oriental colors. And the performances of dance art have left us with equally profound impressions, making us feel that this is almost a miracle.

There are four main schools of Indian classical dance: Bharata Natyam, Kathak, Kathakali, and Manipuri. These four classical dances have a long tradition, and each has its own beautiful style.

The beautiful Indrani Rahman is one of the most outstanding performers of the Bharata Natyam school. Bharata Natyam is popular in southern India and has relatively purely preserved its oldest dance tradition. Since ancient times, women have performed in temples during temple fairs or religious ceremonies to express respect and love for the gods. The "Bharoto" dance performed by Indrani Rahman is an excerpt from a long poem praising the god Shiva (the god of dance), and also a moving love song of a girl to the god:

"…………
Listen to me, I pray to you,
For the sake of loving you, I have completely lost my senses.
I can no longer listen to the sweet songs of the nightingale,
Sleep cannot come to my eyes,
I cannot eat or drink,
The sound of the ocean waves crashing drives me mad.
Listen to me, oh Shiva—you, the resident of beautiful Danzo city.
I rely on you completely, believe me!
Like a bee relying on a lotus flower, believe me, with fire as witness!
Like a fish relying on the ocean, believe me, with heaven and earth as our witnesses!
Together, we will be happy, but in the pain of separation,
I will be drowned in the ocean of love.
…………"

Indrani brilliantly shaped the soul of a passionate and pure girl and a beautiful and moving image. Her expressions and gestures fully express the content of the verses in the ode. The praying with her hands clasped together and a series of clear and vivid movements seem to make us see the waves of the ocean and hear the singing of the nightingale. Bees stop on lotus flowers, fish swim in the sea—all these dances are like visible language. The reason why Indrani's performing talent is so moving is precisely because she has a deep understanding of the origin and characteristics of Bharata Natyam, and also a deep understanding of the ancient Indian people's feelings for the gods. Therefore, the impression she gives us is not only dancing with her hands and feet, but even more touching is that her heart is dancing; her prayers and narrations to the gods are heartfelt confessions. Due to Indrani's proficiency in dance techniques, Bharata Natyam is more perfect in terms of artistic form and structure, and the pure dance performance and dramatic expressions are seamlessly connected in the transitions between sections, just like the Soviet dancer and People's Artist Ulanova's evaluation of her:
      “...An unforgettable impression...your beautiful, poem-like
    dance...performed with a high degree of artistry and beauty...”

The young Aruradha Guha is an outstanding performer of Kathak dance. She began learning Kathak dance at the age of eight, received praise at the age of thirteen, and is not yet twenty years old this year, but her artistic achievements have far exceeded her age.

Kathak dance is popular in northern India. Since the entire Indian dance originated in the south and developed from south to north, we can see the postures of South Indian murals and sculptures in Kathak dance. Its different style from Bharata Natyam lies in the fact that its basic dance moves are graceful dance postures and complex and rapid foot rhythm movements. Aruradha's performance is fascinating. She stands quietly in the misty light, and then moves slightly and gradually, making people feel like the goddess under the moonlight is slowly resurrecting. She comes to us fluttering with tinkling bells, but unknowingly leaves again. The movements of her arms are as soft as gauze, and the rhythm, lines, and tempo of the movements and expressions extend to every fingertip and the corners of her eyebrows and eyes. The rhythm and bells on her feet are even more beautiful. She can use the speed of movements and rhythm to control the intensity or number of bells. The light ones are like the chirping of crickets, the heavy ones are like a storm, the many are hundreds of small bells ringing together, and the few are individual bells ringing jingle. From Aruradha's performance, we see a tradition of tranquil and elegant beauty in Indian art.

Krishna Kutty and Shirin Vajifdar's performance of Kathakali dance is the crystallization of the wisdom and creativity of the Indian people.

Kathakali dance is popular on the coast of southwestern India. It is a dramatic dance, and one or two people can perform a dance drama with a complicated plot. If the name Kathakali is broken down literally, Katha means story and Kali means performance. This school of dancers has mastered twenty-four basic gestures, which can be used like letters to explain various nouns, verbs, adjectives... they can elaborate on tortuous plots and express rich language. We saw Shirin and Krishna perform a dance drama - The Boon. The main idea of the story is: the demon king is imprisoned in the mountains and repents. He asks the god Shiva to give him a terrible reward, that is, if he pats anyone on the head, that person will die. After the demon king receives this reward, he wants to test it on the god Shiva, but later the god Vishnu turns into a beautiful woman, wins the demon king's heart, and then kills the demon king. The main parts of this dance drama are the demon king's solo dance and the dramatic dance of the beautiful woman and the demon king. The structure of the dance drama is very simple, while the movements, gestures and expressions are very interesting and skillful. The intelligent and talented performing artist Krishna, with his vivid creative imagery, uses negative techniques in the creation of the demon king's role, running through interesting and ridiculed, and sometimes terrifying, movements. These movements are clear and full of imagery: such as when he looks out on the mountain, he sees a large elephant under the east mountain, flapping its ears and shaking its long nose, and birds flying in groups; he sees a group of women bathing naked under the west mountain, rubbing their shoulders, washing their faces and arms... etc. The duet is a dramatic "dialogue," which the audience can understand. Shirin's performance of her schemes against the demon king and her disgust towards him is profound and moving.

The serious dancers Singajit Singh and Nadia Singh performed the drum dance for us, which is an ancient rain-seeking dance of the Manipuri dance. They performed it with such piety and enthusiasm that we learned about the natural environment and the life of farmers in India. The Holi dance performed by Suryamukhi Devi and two other dancers showed us another aspect of the Manipuri dance style. It preserves the beauty of classical lyricism, while also absorbing the natural rhythm of folk music. Its wave-like undulating movements and curved and soft lines give people a very pleasant and comfortable feeling.

This time, the Indian cultural delegation not only brought us the appearance of the four schools of classical dance, but also brought us wonderful and vibrant folk dances. The reason why the handkerchief dance is so warmly welcomed by the audience is due to the characteristics of the folk dance itself. It grows among the people and constantly absorbs the atmosphere of life. Therefore, it is often fresh, lively and healthy. The handkerchief dance has reached a relatively complete state in terms of artistry. The rhythm, footwork and movement development are also very varied, from simple to complex, with ups and downs and emotions. What is especially valuable is that it expresses the characters' personalities, the humor in life, and the optimistic spirit of the people. The entire group of dancers in the small ballet troupe headed by Gul Badan are doing a very meaningful work.

The people of India are the most imaginative people. In ancient times, they had already created legends and narrative poems such as the Vedas, the Mahabharata, and the Ramayana, providing the world's literature with magnificent literature. Indian dance art has always occupied a very important position in the cultural life of the Indian people. Long before the era when Buddhists were most active, its influence had spread to the Far East, and even stone carvings of Indian dances can be seen in New Guinea.

The people of India are the most art-loving people. During the invasion of the foreign Mughal Empire from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries, the Indian people waged a protracted struggle to defend the traditional spirit of their national art. Arrests and killings could not eliminate the Indian people's love for traditional art, and they finally won. After a long period, the staunch Indian artists once again searched for the traditional materials of dance art from the destroyed sculptures, statues, and mural relics by the enemy, and continued to develop classical dance.

Indian classical dance is very worthy of our study and research, because Indian dance is a first-class dance in the world and one of the most precious heritages in the world's dance treasury. This is a beauty, a fascinating beauty, and we must cherish it. In order to develop our own national traditional dance, we must learn from the most beautiful art in the world. When appreciating and understanding Indian dance, we must have a rich understanding and imagination of Indian people, history, customs, religion, and magnificent natural environment. When we have this kind of imagination, Indian art can arouse a powerful force in our hearts.

The dance and music performances of the Indian Cultural Delegation not only include classical works, but also express folk works. Through this wonderful art performance, we have seen the spiritual outlook of the Indian people and the tendency of their thoughts and minds, which will greatly and further promote the understanding and friendship between the people of China and India.

### 美妙的印度舞蹈艺术

    美妙的印度舞蹈艺术
    北京舞蹈学校副校长　陈锦清
    这一次，从积雪的喜马拉雅山的那边飞来了印度文化使节——印度文化代表团，它不仅给我们带来了印度人民深厚的友谊，同时给我们带来了伟大邻邦的美妙的艺术演出。
    有机会同这么多卓越的印度艺术家们交谈，欣赏他们的艺术，是一种愉快和幸福。
    “友谊的歌声响四方，
    印中友好万岁！
    啊……
    我们是和平的战士，
    反对侵略战争……”
    从印度歌唱家们热情而豪迈的歌声里，我们好像听到了三亿多印度人民爱好和平和自由的心声，像海洋里的波涛一样有力地引起了我们情绪的共鸣。印度的音乐，无论是声乐或器乐的演出，都富有浓厚的东方色彩。而舞蹈艺术的表演所留给我们的印象，也同样是那样深刻，使我们感觉到这是近乎一种奇迹。
    印度的古典舞蹈主要有四种学派：巴拉达那蒂亚、卡塔克，卡塔卡利和曼尼普利。这四种古典舞蹈都具有悠久的传统，而各有其不同的美妙的风格。
    美丽的印德拉尼·拉赫曼是目前巴拉达那蒂亚舞派最优秀的表演家之一。巴拉达那蒂亚舞流行在印度的南方，比较纯粹地保存了它最古的舞蹈传统，从古以来，当举行庙会或宗教仪式的时候，都是由妇女在神庙里表演，表达对神的尊敬和爱恋。印德拉尼·拉赫曼所表演的“婆罗多”舞就是一首歌颂湿婆神（舞蹈之神）的长诗之一段，也是一首少女对神的动人的恋歌：
    “…………
    听我，我祈求您，
    为了爱您，我已经完全失掉我的感觉。
    我不能再继续听夜莺的甜蜜的歌声，
    睡眠不能来到我的眼帘，
    我不能饮食，
    海洋波浪的撞击声使我疯颠。
    听我，啊，湿婆神——您，美丽的丹佐城的居住者。
    我完完全全依靠着您，相信我！
    好像蜜蜂依靠着荷花，相信我，以火作证！
    好像鱼依靠着海洋，相信我，凭天地为盟！
    在一起，我们会快乐，如果在别离的痛苦之中，
    我将被溺死在爱的海洋中。
    …………”
    印德拉尼天才地塑造了一个热情纯洁的少女的灵魂和美丽动人的形象。她的表情和手势充分地表达出颂歌中的诗句的内容，双手合掌的祈求以及一系列清晰而形象的动作，好像使我们看到了海洋的波浪，听到了夜莺的歌唱。蜜蜂停在荷花上，鱼在海里游，这一切舞蹈都像看得见的语言一样。印德拉尼的表演天才之所以如此动人，正是因为她深刻地理解了巴拉达那蒂亚舞的源流和特点，同时也深刻地理解了古代印度人民对神的感情。因此，她给我们的印象不仅用手和脚在舞蹈，更感人的是她的心灵在舞蹈，她对神的祈求和叙述是心灵的倾诉。由于印德拉尼在舞蹈技巧上的娴熟，使巴拉达那蒂亚舞在艺术形式和结构上更臻完美，使纯舞蹈的表演和戏剧性的表情，在段落衔接上完美无缝，正像苏联舞蹈家、人民演员乌兰诺娃对她的评价一样：
      “……使人难忘的印象……你的美丽的像诗一
    样的舞蹈……以高度的艺术性和美表演出来
      ……”
    年轻的阿鲁拉达·古哈是卡塔克舞卓越的表演者，她八岁开始学卡塔克舞，十三岁就得到赞扬，今年还不满二十岁，可是她艺术上的成就已远远地超过了她的年龄。
    卡塔克舞流行在印度的北方。由于整个印度舞蹈起源于南方，由南向北发展，因此我们从卡塔克舞里看到南印度壁画和雕刻的姿态。它同巴拉达那蒂亚舞的不同风格在于它的舞蹈基本是婀娜的舞姿和变化复杂而迅速的脚的节奏动作。阿鲁拉达的表演是令人神往的。她在薄雾似的灯光下静穆地站立着，然后轻微地，逐渐地移动，令人感到犹如月光下的女神在慢慢地复活了。她带着??的铃声，飘然地向我们走来，可是在不知不觉中又离开去了，她的手臂的动作轻柔如纱，而且动作和表情的韵律，线条和节奏，一直伸延到每一个手指尖端和眉梢眼角。她脚上的节奏和铃声更是优美的，她可以用动作和节奏的快慢来控制铃声的强弱或多少，轻者像蟋蟀的鸣声，重者如急风骤雨，多者几百小铃齐响奏，少者个别铃声响叮叮。从阿鲁拉达的表演里，我们看到了印度艺术中的一种恬静优雅的美的传统。
    克里希纳·库蒂和希林·瓦吉弗尔达表演的卡塔卡利舞，这是印度人民智慧和创造的结晶。
    卡塔卡利舞流行于印度西南部的沿海，它是一种戏剧性的舞蹈，由一个人或两个人可以表演一出情节复杂的舞剧。卡塔卡利舞的名称如从字面上来分解，卡塔是故事的意思，卡利是表演的意思。这一派的舞蹈家掌握了二十四个基本手势，像字母一样可以说明各种名词、动词、形容词……可以阐述曲折的情节，表达丰富的语言。我们看到希林和克里希纳表演了一个舞剧——赏赐。故事的大意是：魔王囚禁在群山中忏悔，他要求湿婆神给他一个可怕的赏赐，那就是他在任何人头上拍一下，那人就死亡。魔王得此赏赐后，就要以湿婆神来试验，后来毗湿奴神变成美女，取得了魔王的欢心后杀死魔王。组成这个舞剧的主要两段，一是魔王的独舞，二是美女和魔王两人戏剧性的舞蹈。舞剧的结构很单纯，而动作、手势和表情是很有趣而巧妙的。多智的天才表演艺术家克里希纳，他具有创作上鲜明的幻像力，使他在魔王角色的创造上使用否定的手法，贯串着有趣和被嘲笑有时是恐怖的动作。这些动作是明确而富于形象性的：如他在山上了望，看见东山下有一大象，扇着耳朵，摇着长鼻子，还有群鸟在飞翔；看见西山下有一群妇女在裸浴，擦肩洗脸洗手臂……等。双人舞那段，是一场戏剧性的
  “对话”，这些“对话”观众都能理解。希林对魔王计谋和厌恶都表演得深刻动人。
    严肃的舞蹈家辛加吉特·辛格和纳迪亚·辛格为我们表演的鼓舞是曼尼普利舞的一种古老的祈雨舞，他们表演得如此虔诚，热烈，使我们了解到印度的自然环境和农民生活的一面。由苏里亚穆基·德维等三位舞蹈家表演的洒红节之舞让我们看到了曼尼普利舞风格的另一方面，它保存了古典的抒情的美，同时又吸收了民间自然的律动。它像波浪一样起伏连绵的动作，弯曲柔美的线条，给人以极愉快舒适的感觉。
    这次，印度文化代表给我们带来了古典舞的四种学派的面貌以外，也带来了精采的、富有生命力的民间舞。手帕舞之所以得到观众的热烈欢迎，是由于民间舞本身的特点，它是生长在人民中间，不断地吸取了生活的气息，因此，它常常是新鲜，活泼和健康的。手帕舞在艺术性上达到了比较完整的境地，节奏、步法和动作的发展上也是很有变化的，从简单到复杂，有起伏，有情绪。特别可贵的是它表现了人物的性格，生活中的风趣，人民的乐观精神。以古尔·巴丹为首的小芭蕾舞剧团的全体舞蹈家们在做着一件非常有意义的工作。
    印度的人民是最富于想像力的人民，在远古的时候他们已经创作了吠陀经，摩诃婆罗多和罗摩衍那等传奇和叙事诗，为世界文学提供了瑰丽的文学。印度的舞蹈艺术在印度人民的文化生活上一直占着很重要的地位，远在佛教徒最活跃的时代以前，它的影响就已经传播到远东，甚至在新几内亚都可以看到印度舞蹈的石刻。
    印度的人民是最酷爱艺术的人民，在十四世纪到十七世纪，外族摩呵尔的侵入的时候，印度人民为保卫自己民族艺术的传统精神，曾经过持久不息的斗争。逮捕和虐杀也不能消灭印度人民对传统艺术的热爱，他们终于得到胜利。经过一个较长的时期，印度的坚贞的艺术家们又从被敌人所破坏的雕刻、石像和壁画残迹中，寻找出舞蹈艺术的传统材料，而继续发展了古典舞蹈。
    印度的古典舞蹈，对我们说来是非常值得揣摩和研究的，因为印度舞蹈是世界上第一流的舞蹈，是世界舞蹈宝库中最珍贵的遗产之一。这是一种美，一种令人神往的美，我们必须珍贵地欣赏它。为了发展我们自己的民族传统舞蹈，必须借鉴于世界上最美丽的艺术。在欣赏和理解印度舞蹈的时候，我们必须对印度的人物、历史、风俗、宗教和宏伟的自然环境有丰富的理解和想像，在我们具有这种想像的时候，印度的艺术才能在我们内心引起强大的力量。
    印度文化代表团的舞蹈和音乐的演出，不仅包括了古典的作品，也表现了民间的作品。通过这次美妙的艺术演出，我们见到了印度人民的精神面貌和思想心灵的倾向，这将大大地、更进一步地促进中印两国人民之间的了解和友情。（附图片）
