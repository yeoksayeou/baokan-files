Since the thawing in May, the Greater Khingan Forest Area in Inner Mongolia has been actively carrying out various basic construction projects. Now, every day, a large number of trucks fully loaded with workers, materials, and tools are heading to various construction sites. This year, the Greater Khingan Forest Area will lay two forest railways, two railway sidings for lumberyards, build three automobile roads, and one production dispatch telephone line. It will also establish four modern factories – a tractor repair factory, two lumber mills, and a power plant. Once the tractor repair factory goes into production, it can manufacture various parts and overhaul machines without having to transport tractors to Harbin and other places for repair.

    大兴安岭林区进行基本建设
    内蒙古大兴安岭林区自五月开冻以来，就积极进行各种基本建设。现在每天都有大量卡车满载工人和材料、工具等开往各个工地。大兴安岭林区今年要铺设两条森林铁路、两条贮木场的铁路专用线，修筑三条汽车公路、一条生产调度电话线。还要建立四座现代化工厂——一座拖拉机修理厂、两座制材厂、一座发电厂。拖拉机修理厂投入生产后，可以自制各种零件，大修机器，不需要再把拖拉机运到哈尔滨等地去修理。　（本报驻呼和浩特记者）
