    Chinese Painters Collaborate on a Huge Traditional Chinese Painting to Dedicate to the World Peace Congress

    (Our newspaper reports) In order to express warm congratulations to the upcoming World Peace Congress, and to express the Chinese people’s support for the cause of world peace, Chinese painters Qi Baishi, Chen Banding, He Xiangning, Yu Fei'an, Wang Shengsheng, Li Ruiling, Ma Jin, Xu Yansun, Yang Min, Wang Xuetao, Wu Yige, Zhang Qiyi, Tian Shiguang, and Duan Luqing, a total of fourteen artists, collaborated on a huge colored ink painting (traditional Chinese painting) called "Ode to Peace," which will be taken to Helsinki by the Chinese delegation attending the World Peace Congress.

    At the beginning of last month, Mr. Varella, the person in charge of cultural issues of the World Peace Council, sent a telegram from Vienna stating that the famous American painter Anton Refregier suggested that progressive artists around the world should contribute to the upcoming World Peace Congress through their art. He hoped that painters from every country could collaborate on a work to decorate the hall of the World Peace Congress and send it to various countries for touring exhibitions after the meeting. The China Peace Committee and the Chinese Artists Association warmly supported this suggestion. The Chinese Artists Association organized fourteen painters in Beijing and spent half a month to create a horizontal colored ink painting (traditional Chinese painting) with a length of 398 cm and a width of 201 cm. The flock of doves in the picture symbolizes the unity and strength of the world's peace forces; the ancient pine and the various blooming flowers symbolize the evergreen and prosperous cause of defending peace. In the process of creation, the painters have given full play to their strengths and demonstrated high artistic skills. The picture is harmonious and unified, with Chinese style and Chinese spirit. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, inscribed the words "Ode to Peace".

    我国画家合作巨幅彩墨画
    献给世界和平大会
    本报讯　为了对即将开幕的世界和平大会表示热烈的祝贺，为了表达中国人民对世界和平事业的拥护，我国画家齐白石、陈半丁、何香凝、于非暗、汪慎生、李瑞龄、马晋、徐燕荪、杨敏、王雪涛、吴一舸、张其翼、田世光和段履青等十四人合作了巨幅彩墨画（国画）“和平颂”，将由出席世界和平大会的中国代表团带往赫尔辛基。
    上月初，世界和平理事会文化问题负责人瓦瑞拉先生由维也纳来电报说：美国著名画家安东·里弗勒吉尔先生建议，全世界进步艺术家应通过他们的艺术对即将举行的世界和平大会作出贡献；他希望每一个国家的画家们，都能合作一幅作品，用以布置世界和平大会的大厅，并且在会后送到各国巡回展览。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国美术家协会热烈支持这个建议，由中国美术家协会组织在京画家十四人，用了半个月的时间，绘成一幅长三百九十八公分、宽二百零一公分的横幅彩墨画（国画）。画面的鸽群，象征着世界和平力量的团结和壮大；古松和盛开的各种花朵，象征着保卫和平的事业万年长青，欣欣向荣。画家们在创作过程中，各尽所长，发挥了高度的艺术技巧。画面和谐统一，具有中国作风和中国气派。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若给题上了字：“和平颂”。
