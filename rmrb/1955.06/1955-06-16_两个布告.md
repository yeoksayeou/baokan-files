Two Public Notices
    Zhao Zonghui

    Recently, Lushan County in Henan Province issued two public notices: one was a notice from the County People's Procuratorate announcing the arrest of a group of criminals who sabotaged agricultural cooperatives; the other was a public notice from the County People's Government announcing the specific policies of agricultural cooperation to the broad masses of farmers.

    Many staff members, even responsible comrades of the district committees, adopted different attitudes towards the two public notices. They actively and proactively publicized the notice announcing the arrest of a group of criminals who sabotaged agricultural cooperatives to the broad masses of people, and held meetings of cooperative members, mass meetings, and meetings of landlords and rich peasants to provide systematic explanations. Some staff members were even able to combine the publicity of the notice with exposing and attacking the enemy's sabotage conspiracies, and accusing illegal elements who sabotaged production and agricultural cooperatives. This approach is undoubtedly correct. However, they adopted a cold attitude towards the latter notice, which focused on publicizing the specific policies of agricultural cooperation. Apart from a few staff members who supported and actively publicized and explained it to the masses, many staff members remained indifferent.

    Many staff members believed that if the principle of voluntary mutual benefit was implemented according to the notice, many farmers would withdraw from the cooperatives, and the percentage of cooperation would not be maintained; the things they had originally told the masses were inconsistent with the provisions in the notice, and acting according to the notice would mean losing their prestige among the masses; the original regulations of the various cooperatives were inconsistent with the regulations in the notice, which would bring many "troubles" to the pre-distribution of the wheat harvest and the summer harvest and planting. Therefore, some people exaggeratedly said: "If we do this, most of the cooperatives will not be able to be maintained!" Some staff members in the Sixth District said: Issuing this notice is deliberately creating trouble for the lower levels! Why didn't they issue it earlier or later, and why did they issue it precisely during the summer harvest distribution? Some even believed that the notice was an "obstacle" to the current rural work and was "embarrassing" for the lower-level staff. Staff members in a township in a certain district even submitted a letter of opinion to the county leading organs, writing: "Why should the policies change? It was originally said that the wheat seedlings in the agricultural cooperatives would be distributed uniformly upon joining the cooperative, but now it is said that whoever plants them will harvest them. Isn't this making it difficult for the cadres at the lower levels?" Some people even suspected that the issuance of this notice was a mistake made by the higher authorities.

    Under the control of these erroneous thoughts, many staff members did not dare or were unwilling to publicize this notice. In the twelve townships of the Tenth District, staff members in four townships locked the notice in drawers or put it in their pockets. In Houlou Village in the Ninth District, as soon as cooperative member Hu Tingming posted the notice, it was torn down by township staff member Hu Tingyao; Hu even severely criticized the person who posted the notice. Throughout the county, the following methods were adopted for posting this notice: The first method was to post one first to see how things are received. If there was no big problem they would post all of the notices issued by the higher authorities. If the 'situation was serious', they would secretly hide the notice, and quickly and secretly tear down and hide those that had already been posted. The term 'serious situation' mainly referred to the fact that after the masses read the notice, some people proposed leaving the cooperative or that whoever planted the wheat seedlings would harvest them, thus overturning the original regulations within the cooperative. The second method was to post them in sparsely populated areas (such as deep ditches, isolated villages, and small roads), not in large villages or markets; only in places without cooperatives, not in places with cooperatives; only in villages where agricultural cooperatives were consolidated, not in villages where agricultural cooperatives had problems and were not consolidated. In places where "all eyes are watching," this notice could not be seen. The third method was to simply "suppress" the notice, saying that it would be posted after the wheat harvest. Staff members in Dongcun Township in the Eighth District hid the notice and only reluctantly posted it when the district committee secretary repeatedly questioned them. Some township staff members even ordered party members to strictly "keep the secret" and not to tell the masses that there was this notice. Some staff members did publicize the notice, but their methods of publicity were different from the general methods. The methods they adopted were: (1) Only tell the cooperative members who have always loved the cooperative cause, not the cooperative members who have ideological doubts, that is, the so-called ideologically unconsolidated cooperative members; tell the farmers outside the cooperative, not the cooperative member masses. (2) Only talk about "land assessment for production, labor, and land distribution ratio" and "draught animals," "farm tools," "trees," "investment," etc., and not about "voluntary entry and exit from the cooperative" and "whoever plants the cooperative member's wheat seedlings will generally harvest them." Even in the few articles that were discussed, there were very strict "boundaries": the "land assessment for production" article was not discussed in cooperatives where land assessment was unreasonable, and the relevant articles were also avoided in places where draught animals, farm tools, and trees were improperly handled. (3) Some staff members distorted the spirit of the notice when publicizing it, and also added their own "analysis" and opinions, such as adding "conditions for joining and leaving the cooperative" when talking about "voluntary," deliberately emphasizing the many contradictions and disadvantages of whoever plants the wheat seedlings harvests them when talking about "whoever plants the wheat seedlings will generally harvest them," and emphasizing that various places can "flexibly apply" the regulations when talking about the handling of draught animals and farm tools (actually meaning that it is not necessary to implement the provisions of the notice). These opinions seriously distorted the content of the notice. Even when the masses raised opinions related to voluntary mutual benefit, some staff members still questioned and attacked them. After the township head of Shisi Township talked about the notice at a cooperative member meeting, two cooperative members proposed that "whoever is willing to plant the wheat seedlings should harvest them." The township head loudly questioned: "Let's see if you can! Can you solve the contradiction of whoever plants them will harvest them?" In some places, cooperative members in groups took the notice to the district office to find the district head and demanded that they act according to the notice, but the staff members of the district office ignored them. Recently, cooperative members who came to the county party committee's rural work department to reason and complain have been endless from morning to night. The reason for complaining is the same - the staff members do not act according to the policies in the notice.

    Why are they only willing to publicize the former notice and unwilling to publicize the latter notice? The main reason is that many staff members only realize that exposing and dealing with things that sabotage agricultural cooperatives is beneficial to consolidating the socialist position in the countryside; but they do not realize the importance of strengthening the unity within the working farmers for consolidating the socialist position in the countryside. Another reason is that the former notice will not bring a lot of "trouble" to the work, and can even be used by some staff members with particularly bad work styles as a means of intimidating some farmers who have opinions about agricultural cooperatives not implementing the principle of voluntary mutual benefit; to implement the policies stipulated in the latter notice, it is necessary to do a lot of meticulous work, and it will expose the shortcomings of past work being sloppy and work style being bad. It should be understood that although there are two notices, they are an integral whole in spirit. If the various specific policies stipulated in the latter notice are not conscientiously implemented, the former notice cannot fully and effectively play its due role. Facts have already proved this point: because many staff members have adopted incorrect attitudes and practices towards the latter notice, it has caused great fluctuations in the masses' thinking and damaged the cause of agricultural cooperation. In Sanchakou and Shisi Villages in the Eleventh District, the masses tore up the notice, and some people tore off the words "voluntary mutual benefit" from the notice, saying: "Since you don't implement it, why bother posting it!" Some farmers said: The notice is good in every way, but it is in vain if the lower levels do not implement it! This has created a big gap for the enemy; it has been discovered that some saboteurs are taking the opportunity to make trouble, incite the masses, and spread vicious rumors such as "the government is issuing a notice to test the people's hearts."

    Facts have also long proved that implementing the principle of voluntary mutual benefit is necessary. After some areas posted the notice, the masses were crowded in front of each notice, and the broad masses of people generally welcomed and supported the notice. Some said: "The people's government's policies are really good, and they are all for the masses!" "If we do it this way, the cooperative will definitely be successful!" Some said: "The Communist Party really understands the people's hearts, and with regulations like this, how can we not be motivated!" Some cooperative members who originally wanted to leave the cooperative did not leave after reading the notice. They said that they had been deceived by bad people and had miscalculated; they said that the Communist Party's policies were reasonable and fair. After publicizing the notice in Erlangmiao Village in the Fifth District, sixty-five individual farmers requested to join the cooperative. The Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Shangya Township was a cooperative that district staff members forced together in the autumn of last year. This spring, more than thirty of the forty-three households in the entire cooperative requested to leave the cooperative, production was stagnant, and the cooperative members were dissatisfied. Later, with the help of the county party committee, the principle of voluntariness was conscientiously implemented. Although twenty-four households left the cooperative, the entire cooperative was consolidated and production completely changed. It has now become one of the best cooperatives in the entire district. These facts prove that implementing the principle of voluntary mutual benefit will not only not cause the cooperative to collapse, but will also powerfully promote the consolidation of the cooperative.

    The Lushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China has taken measures to instruct all party members and staff members in the county to conscientiously study the policies stipulated in the notice, earnestly solve ideological problems, and understand the great significance of implementing the policy of voluntary mutual benefit. And to vigorously carry out systematic publicity to the broad masses of people, so that the notice can play a role in promoting current production and consolidating agricultural cooperatives.

    两个布告
    赵宗惠
    河南鲁山县最近发布了两个布告：一个是县人民检察院宣布逮捕一批破坏农业合作社的犯罪分子的通告；另一个是县人民政府向广大农民群众宣布农业合作化的具体政策的布告。
    不少工作人员，甚至区委负责同志，对两个布告采取了不同的态度。他们把宣布逮捕一批破坏农业合作社的犯罪分子的通告，主动地积极地向广大群众进行宣传，并且召开社员会、群众会、地主富农分子会进行系统的讲解，有些工作人员还能结合宣传通告，揭发和打击敌人的破坏阴谋，控告破坏生产破坏合作社的不法分子。这种做法无疑是正确的。可是，他们对后一个布告，即以宣传农业合作化具体政策为中心内容的布告，除有少数工作人员拥护并积极向群众宣传解释外，不少工作人员却采取了冷淡的态度。
  许多工作人员认为：按照布告贯彻自愿互利原则，许多农民就会退社，就不能保持合作化的百分比了；自己原先对群众讲的和布告上的规定不一致，照布告办事就要丧失自己在群众中的威信；各社原先的规定和布告上的规定不一致，就会给麦季预分和夏收夏种等等工作招来许多“麻烦”。因此，有人就夸大其词地说：“这样办，大部分社都保不住了！”六区有些工作人员讲：发这布告就是故意给下边找麻烦！早不发，晚不发，为什么恰恰在夏收分配的时候发下来呢？有人甚至认为布告是当前农村工作的“障碍”，是给下级工作人员“难堪”。某区一个乡的工作人员甚至给县领导机关递了意见书，写道：“为什么政策要变呢？农业合作社的麦苗原来说的是入社统一分配，现在又叫谁种谁收，这不是叫下边干部作难？”还有人怀疑颁发这个布告是上级搞错了。
    在这些错误思想支配下，许多工作人员不敢或者不愿宣传这个布告。十区十二个乡，就有四个乡的工作人员把布告锁在抽屉里或装在口袋里。在九区胡楼村，社员胡廷明把布告刚贴出去，就被乡工作人员胡廷耀揭下来；胡并且把贴布告的人大大地批评了一顿。在全县各地，对于这个布告采取了这样几种张贴方法：第一种是先贴出一张看看“风声”，如果“风声”不大，就把上级发下的布告全部贴出去，如果“风声”大，“情况严重”，就把布告暗暗“禁闭”起来，把已经张贴出去的也急速地偷偷地揭下藏起。所谓“情况严重”，他们的意思主要是指群众看了布告后有人提出出社或麦苗谁种谁收，使社内原来的规定“翻案”。第二种是往人烟较稀的地方（如深沟、孤庄、小道）贴，不往大庄、街市贴；只往没社的地方贴，不往有社的地方贴；只往农业合作社巩固的村子贴，不往农业合作社有问题不巩固的村子贴。在“众目昭彰”的地方，是看不到这个布告的。第三种，干脆把布告“压”起来，说是要等到麦收后再贴。八区董村乡工作人员把布告藏起，等到区委书记再三追问时才勉强贴出来。有些乡的工作人员，还命令党员严格“保守秘密”，不许告诉群众说有这个布告。有些工作人员对布告是进行了宣传的，但他们的宣传方法却和一般的宣传方法不同，他们采取的方法是：（一）对一贯热爱合作社事业的社员讲，对思想上有疑虑即所谓思想不巩固的社员不讲；对社外农民讲，对社员群众不讲。（二）只讲“土地评产，劳力和土地分配比例”和“耕畜”“农具”“树木”“投资”等条，不讲“入社出社自愿”和“社员麦苗一般谁种谁收”。就是在讲的几条中也有十分严格的“分寸”：在土地评产不合理的社里不讲“土地评产”一条，在耕畜、农具、树木等处理不当的地方也避开有关的条文。（三）有些工作人员在宣传布告时歪曲布告精神，还要加上自己的“分析”和意见，如在讲“自愿”时加上“入社出社的条件”，在讲“麦苗一般谁种谁收”时故意强调谁种谁收的许多矛盾和坏处，在讲耕畜、农具处理办法时，就强调各地可以“灵活运用”（实际上就是说可以不必执行布告的规定）。这些意见严重地歪曲了布告的内容。甚至当群众提出有关自愿互利的意见时，有些工作人员还追问和打击。释寺乡乡长在社员会上讲了布告后，有两个社员提出“愿意麦苗谁种谁收”。乡长就大声追问：“看您能哩！你能解决谁种谁收的矛盾？”有些地方社员成群拿着布告到区公所找区长要求按布告办事，而区公所的工作人员却置之不理。最近，到县委农村工作部说理告状的社员，从早到晚源源不绝。告状的理由都是一个——工作人员不按布告上的政策办事。
    为什么只愿意宣传前一个布告而不愿意宣传后一个布告呢？主要原因是：许多工作人员只认识到揭发和处理破坏农业合作社的事情对于巩固农村的社会主义阵地是有利的；而不认识加强劳动农民内部的团结对于巩固农村社会主义阵地的重要意义。还有一个原因是：前一个布告不会给工作带来很多“麻烦”，甚至可以给某些作风特别不好的工作人员利用来作为威吓一些对农业合作社不执行自愿互利原则有意见的农民的手段；要贯彻执行后一个布告中规定的政策，就必须做许多细致的工作，而且会暴露出来过去工作草率、作风不好的缺点。应当了解：布告虽是两个，精神上却是一个整体。如果不认真贯彻执行后一个布告上所规定的各项具体政策，前一个布告也就不能充分地有力地发挥它应有的作用。事实已经证明了这一点：由于许多工作人员对后一个布告采取了不正确的态度和做法，已经在群众思想上引起很大的波动，损害了农业合作化的事业。十一区三岔口、释寺两村群众把布告撕毁了，有的把布告上的“自愿互利”几个字扣掉了，说道：“既然不执行，还贴他干啥哩！”有些农民说：布告千好万好，就是下边不执行，也是枉然！这就给敌人造成了很大的空子；已经发现有些破坏分子趁机捣乱，煽动群众，散布“政府出布告是试群众的心哩”等等恶毒的谣言。
    事实也早就证明了贯彻自愿互利原则是必要的。有些地区把布告贴出以后，每个布告的前面都围挤着群众，广大群众对布告普遍欢迎拥护。有的说：
  “人民政府的政策真好，处处都是为的群众！”“照这样办，社一定能搞好！”有的说：“共产党真是看透了人民的心，像这样规定，干着怎么会没劲！”原来有些社员要求出社，看了布告后也不出社了。他们说过去是上了坏人的当，把算盘打错了；说共产党的政策合情合理。五区二郎庙村在宣传布告以后，有六十五户单干农民要求入社。上崖乡和平农业合作社是去年秋季区工作人员强迫“捆”起来的社，今春全社四十三户就有三十几户要求出社，生产停顿，社员不满。后来，由县委帮助认真地贯彻了自愿原则，虽然有二十四户出社了，但是全社却巩固了，生产完全变了样，现在变成了全区数得着的好社。这些事实证明：贯彻自愿互利原则不仅不会使社垮台，并且能有力地促进社的巩固。
    中共鲁山县委已经采取措施，指示全县所有党员、工作人员认真地学习布告中规定的政策，切实地解决思想问题，懂得贯彻自愿互利政策的重大意义。并且向广大群众大张旗鼓地开展系统的宣传，使布告发挥推动当前生产和巩固农业合作社的力量。
