Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 11th: According to TASS, "l'Humanité" published the resolution of the Central Committee Political Bureau of the French Communist Party. The resolution pointed out that the proposals made by the Soviet government in its note to the Federal Republic of Germany are a major factor in consolidating peace in Europe.

The resolution also stated that "restoring the unity of a democratic Germany, concluding a peace treaty guaranteeing Germany's independence and autonomy, as well as guaranteeing the security of countries bordering Germany, will greatly promote the maintenance of peace and create favorable conditions for ensuring European collective security."

The Political Bureau expressed deep satisfaction with the steps taken by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries of the socialist camp aimed at strengthening world peace, and called on all Communist Party members and all Communist Party organizations to more broadly launch the struggle to defend peace and strengthen the movement to collect signatures for the "Appeal to the People of the World."

The Political Bureau emphasized that "it is the responsibility of Communist Party members to call on public opinion to actively demand that the French government adopt an independent stance that conforms to the national interests of France, so as to ensure the success of future international negotiations on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the peaceful settlement of the German question."
