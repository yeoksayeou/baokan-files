    The People's Hearts Are With the Asian-African Conference
    ——Asian-African Conference Diary Li Shenzhi Zhang Yan
   (Continued from yesterday)
    Enthusiastic Overseas Chinese
    April 25, Monday
    The unprecedented Asian-African Conference in history has concluded last night, but everything about the Asian-African Conference still absorbs people's attention.
    The conference hall in the Independence Building is empty, but around it, the flags of the twenty-nine countries still flutter in the morning breeze, and in front of its doors, people still come from time to time to look up. The press room, although much quieter than yesterday, still has many people waiting for the speeches at the closing meeting that were not printed yesterday, and waiting for the final version of the final communiqué. In addition, they are busy sending their estimates and hopes for the Asian-African Conference obtained in Bandung to the world.
    At least, the Indonesian newspapers published this morning, regardless of which party they belong to, unanimously praised the gains of the conference. "Berita Indonesia" is titled "Historical Milestone," "Rakjat" is titled "A Good Start," and "Bintang Timur" is titled "Victory of Asia and Africa." "Abadi" said: "The conference produced a strong sense of national self-esteem among the Asian and African people." "Merdeka" said: The conference laid the foundation for cooperation between Asian and African countries, "This is history that must be written with a golden pen."
    Last night's gains are inspiring and warming the hearts of millions of people today.
    At the Homann Hotel and the Preanger Hotel, piles and piles of large and small boxes appear at the entrance. Cars still bearing the red sign "Asian-African Conference" carry people of various shapes and colors to the airport or train station.
    People stand at the door, shaking hands, smiling, and saying, "Goodbye."
    A week ago, when people came here from various distant places, many of them had never seen each other's faces or heard each other's languages. However, today, at the time of parting, they are no longer so unfamiliar.
    During this time, people made contact and gained understanding. Many came with suspicion and apprehension, and returned with goodwill and understanding.
    There are countless such examples, but one is enough. Prince Naradhip Bongsprabandh, head of the Thai delegation, told an Antara News Agency reporter after meeting with Zhou Enlai, head of the Chinese delegation, that the two sides had developed a good understanding during the talks. He believes that Thailand's foreign policy should be reconsidered to adapt to the changing and developing international situation.
    Asian and African countries have sown the seeds of friendship in Bandung, and may they all blossom and bear fruit.
                *　*　*　*
    For the 80,000 overseas Chinese in Bandung, today is a day of special significance. The delegation of the People's Republic of China will attend their reception.
    The reception will be held at the Guang Zhao Guild Hall on Lianwang Street at 11:30 am.
    Before ten o'clock, Lianwang Street was already lined with neat rows of students from various overseas Chinese schools. The auditorium of the Guang Zhao Guild Hall can only accommodate three or four hundred people, and thousands of people have to stand on the street. Many old ladies called "Tangshan Bomu" also stood on the street, braving the sun, holding their children and grandchildren in one hand and holding a banana leaf fan in the other, waiting for an hour or two.
    Most touching of all, Mr. Chen Yuzhang, who is over seventy years old, could hardly walk, but was still supported by his family to see the relatives from his motherland.
    At half past eleven, the delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai arrived. They were accompanied by Sanusi, the Governor of West Java, and Enno, the Mayor of Bandung.
    The long-cherished wish of the Bandung compatriots has been fulfilled. Thousands of people shouted in unison: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" The young students clapped their hands until they hurt, and jumped up hugging each other in joy.
    Premier Zhou Enlai addressed the overseas Chinese at the reception.
    He first expressed his gratitude to the overseas Chinese in Bandung for their warm welcome.
    Then, Premier Zhou pointed out: Today's China is not the old China, but the new China. After overthrowing colonial and feudal rule, the Chinese people have stood up in the world. China has succeeded in political revolution, but is still very backward in terms of economy and culture. China needs a long period of construction to catch up with the industrially advanced countries in the world today, and therefore needs a peaceful international environment.
    Premier Zhou went on to explain that the new China's foreign policy is fundamentally different from that of the old China. The new China pursues an independent and peaceful foreign policy, while the old China pursued a foreign policy of fearing the strong and bullying the weak. The government of the old China bowed down to the imperialists who were stronger than itself, and wanted to bully and take advantage of those who were weaker than itself. Now, if anyone bullies us, we must resist, and for those countries that treat us equally, we will extend our hands to cooperate with them in friendship. The Chinese delegation adopted this attitude at this Asian-African Conference.
    Premier Zhou also said: China is strong. However, the Chinese people, whether at home or abroad, must never be proud because of this. We should treat all countries equally, regardless of size or strength.
    Premier Zhou asked the overseas Chinese to be vigilant against the deceptive activities of the Chiang Kai-shek elements among the overseas Chinese, and asked the overseas Chinese to work hard to persuade those overseas Chinese who are temporarily deceived to expand the unity within the overseas Chinese. Premier Zhou said that doing so would not only be beneficial to the Chinese overseas Chinese, but also to the Indonesian government.
    After analyzing the contents of the treaty on dual nationality of overseas Chinese recently signed by the Chinese and Indonesian governments, Premier Zhou called on the overseas Chinese to implement this treaty well.
    Finally, Premier Zhou earnestly exhorted all overseas Chinese to respect the sovereignty of the Indonesian state, the laws and decrees of the government, and to unite, be friendly, and live in harmony with the Indonesian people. Premier Zhou especially emphasized: The higher China's international status, the more humble the Chinese people should be.
    The speech, which lasted more than an hour, was interrupted from time to time by bursts of applause. Whenever there was applause in the hall, the street followed suit, and it was even longer and louder.
    For more than a week, every member of the Chinese delegation or Chinese reporter had always felt the Bandung overseas Chinese's love for the motherland.
    Every day, the Chinese delegation received all kinds of beautiful tropical flowers. They were sent by the overseas Chinese.
    Every day, all kinds of freshly picked vegetables were sent to Daman Sari No. 10, with labels stating that they were sent directly to the delegation from the overseas Chinese's own vegetable gardens.
    Reporters in Bandung all knew that a red convertible was the exclusive car of Chinese photographers. This car belonged to an overseas Chinese, and the driver was the owner of the car. Whether it was day or night, he insisted on driving the people from the motherland himself.
    In order to welcome the arrival of the Chinese delegation, many overseas Chinese automatically gave up their houses and cars because the Chinese delegation was coming to Bandung. Although the delegation only needed very few houses and cars, in the eyes of patriotic overseas Chinese, it was happiness to be able to serve the representatives of the motherland, and it would be a pity if they did not get such an opportunity.
    The meticulous care for the personnel of the delegation in every aspect of life, from eating, walking, lodging to life, fully demonstrated the overseas Chinese's love for the motherland.
    However, only at today's reception did the overseas Chinese and the people from the motherland have the opportunity to meet each other and to express their feelings to each other.
    The reception did not end until one o'clock in the afternoon. When Premier Zhou Enlai and other members of the delegation walked out of the Guang Zhao Guild Hall, the overseas Chinese who had stood on Lianwang Street under the scorching sun for several hours once again erupted in a storm-like cheer.

    人民的心同亚非会议在一起
    ——亚非会议日记 　李慎之  张彦
   （续昨）
    热情的华侨
    四月二十五日　星期一
    历史上空前的第一次亚非会议已经在昨夜闭幕了，但是关于亚非会议的一切仍然吸收着人们的注意。
    独立大厦的会议厅里空无一人，但是在它的周围，二十九国的国旗仍然在晨风里飘扬，在它的门前，仍然不时有人走来仰望。记者室里，虽然比昨天清静了许多，也还是有不少人在等候昨天没有来得及印发的闭幕会议上的发言，等候最后公报的最后定本。此外，他们也忙着把在万隆得到的对于亚非会议的估计和希望发到全世界去。
    至少，今天早上出版的印度尼西亚报纸不论属于那一个党派，都是一致赞扬会议的收获的。“新闻报”的标题是“历史里程碑”，“人民日报”的标题是“很好的开端”，“东星报”的标题是“亚洲和非洲的胜利”。“永恒报”说：“会议使亚非人民产生了强烈的民族自尊感”。“独立报”说：会议奠定了亚非国家合作的基础，“这是必须用金笔写下的历史。”
    昨天晚上的收获今天在鼓舞着、温暖着千千万万人的心。
    在豪曼饭店和普里安格尔饭店，门口不断出现
  一堆一堆的大箱子、小箱子。依旧是挂着“亚非会议”的红牌子的汽车，把各种模样、各种服色的人们载到飞机场或者火车站去。
    人们站在门口，互相握手，笑着，说：“再见”。
    一个星期以前，当人们从各个遥远的地方到这里来的时候，他们中间有许多从来没有见过彼此的容貌，从来没有听过彼此的语言，然而，今天，在分手的时候，他们已经不是那样陌生了。
    在这个时间内，人们进行了接触，取得了了解。许多人带着猜疑和顾虑来，带着善意和谅解回去。
    有无数这样的例子，但是只要举出一个就够了。泰国代表团团长那拉底亲王在和中国代表团团长周恩来会谈以后告诉安塔拉通讯社的记者说：双方在会谈中已经产生了良好的了解。他认为，应该重新考虑泰国的外交政策，以适应国际形势的改变和发展。
    亚非国家在万隆播下了友谊的种子，愿它们都能开花结果。
                *　*　*　*
    对于万隆的八万华侨来说，今天是一个有特别意义的日子，中华人民共和国代表团要出席他们的招待会。
    招待会的地点是在连望街的广肇会馆，时间是上午十一点半。
    十点钟还没有到，连望街上就排满了各华侨学校学生整齐的队伍。广肇会馆的礼堂只能容纳三、四百人，成千的人不能不站在大街上。许多被称做
  “唐山伯姆”的老太太们，也站在当街，顶着太阳，一手牵着儿孙，一手擎着芭蕉扇，一个钟头，两个钟头地等。
    最令人感动的是，一位七十多岁的陈郁章老先生，已经路都走不动了，但是还是由家人搀扶着要来看一看祖国的亲人。
    十一点半钟，以周恩来总理为首的代表团到了。同他们一起来的还有西爪哇的省长山努西和万隆市长恩诺。
    万隆侨胞好多天以来的心愿达到了。成千的人齐声高喊：“中华人民共和国万岁！”青年学生们拍痛了手，欢喜得互相拥抱着跳起来。
    周恩来总理在招待会上向华侨们讲了话。
    他首先向万隆华侨的热情欢迎表示了感谢。
    然后，周总理指出：今天的中国不是旧中国而是新中国。在推翻了殖民的和封建的统治以后，中国人已经在世界上站起来了。中国在政治上是革命成功了，但是，在经济上和文化上仍旧很落后，中国需要长时期的建设，才能赶上今天世界上工业先进的国家，因此需要一个和平的国际环境。
    周总理接着说明：新中国的外交政策也是跟旧中国根本不同的。新中国奉行的是独立自主的和平外交政策，而旧中国奉行的是怕强欺弱的外交政策。旧中国的政府看到比自己强的帝国主义就叩头屈服，看到比自己还弱的就想欺负占便宜。现在，如果有人欺侮我们，我们一定要抵抗，而对于那些以平等待我的国家，我们就伸出手来，同它们友好合作。在这次亚非会议上，中国代表团采取的就是这种态度。
    周总理又说：中国强大了。但是，中国人民不论在国内，在海外，千万不能因此而骄傲。我们对一切国家，不分大小强弱，都应该平等相待。
    周总理要求侨胞们警惕蒋介石分子在华侨中的欺骗活动，要求侨胞们努力去说服那些暂时被蒙蔽的侨胞，来扩大侨胞内部的团结。周总理说，这样做不但对中国侨胞是有利的，而且对印度尼西亚政府也是有利的。
    周总理分析了中国和印度尼西亚两国政府最近签订的关于侨民双重国籍的条约的内容之后，号召侨胞很好地执行这个条约。
    周总理最后谆谆告诫全体侨胞，尊重印度尼西亚国家的主权，政府的法令，与印度尼西亚人民团结友好，和睦相处。周总理特别着重说：中国的国际地位越高，中国的人民就越应该谦虚。
    一个多钟头的讲话不时被一阵又一阵的掌声打断。每当礼堂里一鼓掌，大街上也就跟着鼓掌，而且，更久更响。
    一个多星期以来，每一个中国代表团的团员们或中国来的记者都无时不感到万隆华侨热爱祖国的心情。
    每天，中国代表团都要收到各色各样美丽的热带鲜花。那是华侨送来的。
    每天都有各色各样的刚刚从地里拔出来的蔬菜送到达曼·沙里十号，菜上贴着的标签说明它们是华侨们从自己的菜圃里直接送给代表团的。
    在万隆的记者都知道有一辆红色敞篷汽车是中国摄影记者的专用汽车。这辆汽车是华侨的，而司机就是车子的主人，不论白天黑夜，他都一定要亲自给祖国来的人们开车。
    为了迎接中国代表团的到来，许多华侨因为中国代表团要到万隆来而自动让出了房屋和汽车。虽然代表团只需要极少的房屋和汽车，而在爱国的华侨看来，能为祖国的代表服务就是幸福，而如果得不到这样的机会就是憾事。
    从吃饭、行路、住宿到生活的每一方面对代表团人员的无微不至的关怀充分表现了华侨对祖国的热爱。
    但是，只有到今天的招待会上，侨胞和祖国来的人才得到了相互见面的机会，才得到了相互倾吐感情的机会。
    招待会到午后一点钟才结束。当周恩来总理和代表团其他人员们走出广肇会馆的时候，连望街上在烈日下站了几小时的侨胞再一次发出了暴风雨似的欢呼。  （待续）
