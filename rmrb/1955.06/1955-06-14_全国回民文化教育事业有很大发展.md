    The cultural and educational undertakings of the Hui people nationwide have greatly developed. Currently, there are over one thousand Hui primary schools across the country, with more than 250,000 Hui primary school students, accounting for 56 percent of the nation's Hui school-age children. In some areas, the number of Hui children enrolled in schools has increased more than tenfold compared to before liberation. There are twenty-four specialized Hui middle schools nationwide, and Hui classes have also been added to general middle schools in various regions. There are already 28,127 Hui middle school students. In higher normal schools and universities, there are 1,947 Hui university students.
    The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government are deeply concerned about and vigorously assist the Hui people in developing cultural and educational undertakings. Every year, the People's Government allocates huge amounts of ethnic education subsidies to help Hui schools and impoverished Hui students. It also dispatches many outstanding workers and experienced Han teachers to Hui schools to help them improve their administration and teaching work. Many Hui schools have newly built or expanded school buildings and added teaching equipment. Various regions have also trained more than 7,000 Hui primary school teachers and 977 middle school teachers. In Xi'an City, in 1954 alone, more than ten outstanding Hui teachers were promoted to serve as principals and directors of studies.
    The living habits of the Hui people are taken care of and respected in schools. Some schools have newly purchased food utensils, cooking utensils, and water buckets to establish Hui canteens. Beijing No. 4 Girls' Middle School, No. 14 Middle School, and No. 26 Middle School have all established dining groups for Hui students. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has also notified all secondary schools in Beijing that Hui students residing at school can apply to transfer to these three schools for study based on the principle of voluntariness. After the summer vacation last year, sixty-three people transferred to these three schools.
    In areas where the Hui people live in concentrated communities, the government also helps Hui youth participate in spare-time cultural learning. In Xi'an, more than 940 Hui youths have participated in learning, and seven reading rooms have been established in Hui-populated streets and alleys. Science lecture meetings have been organized to teach various scientific knowledge to Hui youths. In the streets where the Hui people live in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, specialized Hui Cultural Centers have been established.

    全国回民文化教育事业有很大发展
    全国回民的文化教育事业有了很大的发展。现在全国有回民小学一千所以上，有回民小学生二十五万多名，占全国回民学龄儿童的百分之五十六。有些地区入学的回民儿童比解放前增加了十倍多。全国专设的回民中学有二十四所，各地一般中学内还添设了回民班，回民中学生已有二万八千一百二十七名。在高等师范学校和高等学校中，有回民大学生一千九百四十七名。
    中国共产党和人民政府十分关怀并大力帮助回族人民发展文化教育事业。每年人民政府都拨出巨额的民族教育补助费，帮助回民学校和贫苦的回民学生；并调派了许多优秀的工作人员和有经验的汉族教师到回民学校，帮助学校改进行政和教学工作。许多回民学校新建或扩建了校舍，增添了教学设备。各地还培养了七千多名回民小学教师和九百七十七名中学教师，西安市一九五四年就有十多名优秀的回民教师被提拔担任校长和教导主任等职务。
    回族人民的生活习惯在学校里受到照顾和尊重。有的学校为了成立回民灶，从新购置了食具、炊具和水桶。北京市第四女子中学、第十四中学和第二十六中学都设立了回族学生伙食团。北京市文教局并通知北京各中等学校，凡住校的回族学生都可根据自愿原则，申请调到这三个学校学习。去年暑期开学后，有六十三人转到这三个学校。
    在回民居住较集中的地区，政府还帮助回民青年参加业余文化学习。在西安有九百四十多名回族青年参加了学习，在回民聚居的街巷建立了七个阅览室，成立了科学听讲会，向回民青年讲授各种科学知识。在郑州、开封回民聚居的街道，专门设立了回民文化馆。　（新华社）
