Youth Standing on Construction Posts in Northwest China

I have developed a deep affection for the Great Northwest

Dear young friends:

I am a young student who graduated from Tongji University in Shanghai in 1953 and came to Northwest China to participate in the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. The vigorously developing construction projects in the Northwest region have made me develop a deep affection for the Northwest.

I grew up in Shanghai and have never left my family. After graduating from university, adhering to the principle of serving the needs of the country, I was determined to leave my hometown with a heart full of enthusiasm for building the Great Northwest. At that time, my parents were very sad when they heard that I was going to the Northwest, as if they had suffered some misfortune. They said, "A girl can build the country anywhere, why go to a desolate place?" Some people said that the Northwest is full of yellow wind all day long, and a gust of wind can roll cattle, sheep, and people into the air; others said that the Northwest is full of wild animals, and people and livestock are often eaten, making it impossible to live there, and so on. After hearing these words, I was indeed a little worried. However, when I thought of Chairman Mao's call to build the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, thought of the rich underground mineral resources in the Northwest waiting for people to discover, thought of the country needing us to build the Great Northwest, how could we young people covet a comfortable life? I finally dispelled my worries, persuaded my parents, and came to the Northwest.

When I first arrived, I was assigned to work in the Third Engineering Section of the First Engineering Bureau of the New Railway Engineering Bureau. The climate here is relatively dry and there is a lot of wind and sand. At first, I was indeed a little unaccustomed to it; however, after a long time, I gradually got used to it. In fact, life here is not as hard as some people describe it. We can often eat fresh vegetables, fish, meat, and very good rice on the construction site. Of course, life in this place is much harder than in some large coastal cities. However, the hard life here is only temporary after all. We understand that today's hardship will be exchanged for a happier life.

Since coming to the Northwest, I have learned a lot in practical work, which has improved me in both work and ideology. When I worked at the Jiehe Prefabricated Parts Factory, the leadership asked me to be responsible for the technical guidance work of the factory. The workload of the prefabricated parts factory is very large, and the technology is very complex. It requires the adoption of new construction methods and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in prefabricated assembly of concrete bridge piers and abutments. There are many problems that are generally not encountered in industrial universities. My task of giving guidance was like entering a new industrial university again. When bridge and culvert engineering was very tight, I found that the finished concrete products had to be left for twelve to sixteen hours before steam curing, which seriously affected the progress of bridge and culvert engineering. Therefore, I decided to study this complex technical problem. I asked many people, but no one could explain the reason for leaving it for such a long time. I read many books on steam curing, wrote letters to teachers at the school for advice, and studied with the workers. Later, it was determined that this practice had no scientific basis. I made a suggestion to the leaders of the work area to improve this system. After testing, the concrete could be steam-cured without solidifying, which shortened the curing time from forty-eight hours to twenty-four hours. The finished concrete products were not only up to standard, but also greatly shortened the production cycle.

When I complete a task, I feel unspeakably happy. Once, when I was with engineers and technicians checking the center line position and horizontal elevation of the No. 1 pier of the Jiehe Bridge, a cold wave suddenly struck. In an instant, gray earth filled the air, and the strong wind howled through the tall piers, and the cold wind pierced the bones. At this time, it was very dangerous to work at high altitude on the pier. However, we cannot allow the cold wave to disrupt our work. At this time, I held the ladder and climbed to the top, facing the cold wind and aiming at the mirror in front for measurement. The cold wind made my skin stiff and painful, but my heart was fiery. I finally completed the task.

In May of this year, I was selected as an advanced worker and participated in the advanced workers conference of the First Engineering District of the New Railway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which made me feel very honored. I will definitely work harder in the future.

Young friends! The construction projects in various parts of the motherland are waiting for you, and the rich underground treasures are waiting for you to discover. How much the people here hope that you will come to build the Great Northwest! Come on, let us work together on various fighting posts in the construction of the interior of the motherland!

Striving Hard for a Happy Future

Comrade Editor:

In the autumn of 1952, I graduated from Tangshan Railway College, studied station yard design on the China Changchun Railway for a month, and then was assigned to the Northwest Design Office of the Ministry of Railways to participate in the survey and design of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway.

Soon after arriving in Wuwei, I followed the engineer to the vicinity of Wushaoling to determine the location of the station yard. At that time, Wushaoling was covered in white snow, and the temperature dropped to minus 30 degrees Celsius. We were surveying in the field, crossing the Great Wall of China more than 20 times a day, and we didn't feel cold at all, and sometimes we even broke a sweat. The old folks on the grassland were surprised to see us running around in the cold wind. When they knew that a large station and a locomotive depot were going to be built on this land, that the locomotives would be whizzing every day, that thousands of workers would be working here, and that this place would gradually develop into a town, they all laughed.

For me, life in the Northwest is harder than in Shanghai, but our spirit is happy. Every day we come back from work in the afternoon, dance together, and carry out political study in the evening or morning, criticizing each other; at night, no matter whether snowflakes are floating on the quilt, we fall asleep and sleep soundly until dawn.

People who haven't been to the Northwest always think that the Northwest is a poor and backward area, but in our two years of survey, we have found that the Northwest's resources are endless. The Jiuquan Basin (Yumen), Xinjiang, and the Qaidam Basin are vast oil seas, and the Qilian Mountains and Helan Mountains are two treasure mountains, with gold mines, copper mines, coal mines... The resources are so abundant that they cannot be counted. The Northwest's animal husbandry ranks first in the country, and the grasslands are truly "full of cattle and sheep." Speaking of agriculture, people generally think that the south of the Yangtze River is the richest, but in fact, the potential of agriculture in Xinjiang, Gansu, and Qinghai is very great. Jin Zhangye, Yin Wuwei, Tianshui, Zhongwei, Zhongning... When you arrive in these places, people from the south of the Yangtze River think they have returned to their hometown!

The resources of the Northwest are abundant, and once its potential is realized, it will change the lives of our country and people. At present, although life here is not as good as in large coastal cities, we must work hard for the construction of a happy future. Soviet experts, in order to help our country's construction, have not been afraid of hardship, and have helped us with surveying, design, and construction in various parts of the Northwest. How can we be afraid of hardship when it comes to the construction of our own country?

Comrade Editor: Please tell the young comrades in various places, come to the Northwest! There are abundant resources here, and 30 million people of all ethnic groups are expecting you to participate in the great construction cause!

Li Yiquan, Station Yard Section, Northwest Design Branch of the Ministry of Railways

### 站在祖国西北的建设岗位上的青年

    站在祖国西北的建设岗位上的青年
    我对大西北发生了深厚的感情亲爱的青年朋友们：
    我是一九五三年在上海同济大学毕业后来到祖国西北参加建设兰新铁路的一个青年学生。西北地区蓬勃发展着的建设事业，使我对西北发生了深厚的感情。
    我生长在上海，从来没有离开过家庭。大学毕业后，在服从祖国需要的原则下，我怀着建设大西北的满腔热忱，决心离开家乡。当时，我的爸爸妈妈听说我要去西北，就像遭了什么不幸一样，心里非常难过。他们说：“一个女孩子要建设祖国在哪里不行，为什么要跑到荒无人烟的地方去呢？”有人说西北整天刮黄风，一阵风过把牛羊和人都卷上半空；也有人说，西北野兽成群，人畜常被吃掉，根本无法居住，等等。我听了这些话以后，心里确实有些顾虑。但是，当我想到了毛主席关于修筑兰新铁路的号召，想到了西北有着丰富的地下矿藏等待着人们去发掘，想到了祖国需要我们去建设大西北，我们年轻人怎么能贪图舒适的生活呢？我终于消除了自己的顾虑，说服了爸爸妈妈，来到了西北。
    刚来时，我被分配在新建铁路工程总局第一工程局第三工程段工作。这里气候比较干燥，风沙多，最初，确实有些不大习惯；但是，时间久了，我就慢慢地习惯了。事实上这里的生活并不像有些人形容的那么苦，我们在工地上经常可以吃到新鲜的蔬菜、鱼、肉，还有很好的大米。当然，生活在这个地方比起沿海一些大城市来是要苦得多的。但是，这里的艰苦生活毕竟是暂时的。我们懂得今天的艰苦将会换来更幸福的生活。
    来到西北以后，我已经在实际工作中学到了不少的东西，使我在工作上和思想上提高了一步。我在界河成品厂工作时，领导上让我负责这个厂的技术辅导工作。成品厂的工作量很大，技术十分复杂，需要采用新的施工方法，学习苏联混凝土桥墩台成品拼装的先进经验，有许多问题是一般的工业大学里接触不到的。我担任了辅导工作，等于又一次进了新的工业大学。在桥涵工程非常紧张的时候，我发现打好的混凝土成品要停放十二小时到十六小时才进行蒸气养生工作，严重地影响桥涵工程的进度。于是，我决定研究这个复杂的技术问题。我问了许多人，对于为什么要停放这样长时间，谁也说不上个道理。我翻阅了许多关于蒸气养生的书籍，并且写信向学校的老师们请教，和工人群众一起研究，后来确定这种做法是没有科学根据的。我向工区领导上提出了改进这个制度的建议，经过试验后，打好混凝土不用凝固就可以进行蒸气养生，使保温时间从四十八小时缩短为二十四小时，混凝土成品不仅合乎标准，而且大大缩短了生产周期。
    当我完成一件任务的时候，我的心里有说不出的愉快。有一次，我随工程师和技术人员们在界河大桥第一号桥墩校对中线位置和水平标高时，突然寒流袭来了。一霎时，灰土弥漫，大风刮得高大的桥墩呼呼叫啸，冷风刺人骨髓。这时要到桥墩上进行高空作业是十分危险的。但是，我们不能让寒流扰乱我们的工作，这时，我就扶着梯子爬到最高顶，迎着寒风瞄着前面的镜子进行测量，寒风吹得我皮肉僵痛，但我的心里却是火热的。我终于完成了任务。
    今年五月里，我被选为先进工作者，参加了铁道部新建铁路工程总局第一工程区的先进工作者大会，这使我感到非常光荣，我以后一定更加努力地工作。
    青年朋友们！祖国内地各方面的建设事业正等待着你们，丰富的地下宝藏正等待你们去发掘，这里的人民群众是多么盼望你们来建设大西北啊！来吧，让我们在建设祖国内地的各个战斗岗位上携手并进吧！
    铁道部新建铁路工程总局第一工程区先进工作者  庄瑞英
    艰苦奋斗为了幸福的将来编辑同志：
    一九五二年秋天我从唐山铁道学院毕业出来，到中长路学习了一个月的站场设计，以后，就被分配到铁道部西北设计处，参加兰新铁路的勘测设计工作。
    到武威不久，我就随着工程师到了乌鞘岭附近来定测站场。当时，乌鞘岭上下一片雪白，气温降到零下三十度，我们在野外勘测，每天要跨过万里长城二十几次，一点也不觉得寒冷，有时还要冒汗。草原上的老乡，看我们在冷风里奔来走去，都很惊奇。当他们知道：在这片大地上要修建起一个大的车站和一个机务段，火车头将要每天呜呜地叫个不停，将要有千把个工人在这里工作，这片地方将要逐渐繁衍成一个市镇的时候，一个个都呵呵地大笑起来。
    对我说来，西北的生活比起上海来是艰苦的，但是我们的精神是愉快的。我们每天下午收工回来，跳一下集体舞，晚上或早上进行政治学习，互相间展开批评；晚上不管雪花是否飘在被子上，睡下来呼呼一觉就是天明。
    没有来西北的人，总以为西北是贫穷、落后的地区，但是在我们两年多来的勘测过程中，我们发现西北的富源是无穷无尽的。酒泉盆地（玉门）、新疆、柴达木盆地是一片汪洋油海，祁连山、贺兰山是两座宝山，金矿、铜矿、煤矿……，资源丰富得数不清。西北的畜牧业占全国第一，大草原里真是“遍地是牛羊”。提起农业，一般人总以为江南最富，实际上新疆、甘肃、青海农业的潜在力非常大，金张掖，银武威、天水、中卫、中宁……到了这些地方，从江南来的人还以为是回到了故乡呢！
    西北的资源是丰富的，一旦把它的潜力发挥出来，就会改变我们国家和人民的生活面貌。目前，这里的生活虽然比不上沿海大城市，但是为了建设幸福的将来，我们必须艰苦奋斗。苏联专家为了帮助我国建设，不辞劳苦，在西北各地帮助我们进行勘测设计和施工，难道我们对待自己祖国的建设还能怕艰苦吗？
    编辑同志：请你告诉各地青年同志们，到西北来吧！这里有丰富的资源，有三千万各族人民在期待着你们来参加伟大建设事业！
