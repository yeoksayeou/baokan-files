    Working People of the German Democratic Republic Struggle to Fulfill the Five-Year Plan
    Rudi Kirchner, Secretary of the National Executive Committee of the Free German Trade Union Federation
    Political power in the German Democratic Republic is in the hands of workers and peasants. The employees of state-owned enterprises no longer work for a handful of capitalists who seek profit, but for themselves and for the benefit of the whole society. Precisely because of this, all working people are deeply concerned about the rapid economic development and comprehensive consolidation of the worker-peasant state. As the largest mass organization of the working class, the trade union’s attitude towards the state in this situation is completely different from what it is under capitalism. In the German Democratic Republic, there are no antagonistic contradictions between the worker-peasant state and the trade union. The main task of the trade union is to continuously strengthen their own state and prevent sabotage by the enemy. Several generations of German workers fought to establish this state, and hundreds of thousands of workers gave their lives for it. Consolidating the state requires, first and foremost, continuous economic development, producing more, better, and cheaper products, increasing the profitability of socialist enterprises, and fully tapping all the potential of the national economy. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the trade union mobilized the working people to complete the state's national economic plan, and to complete and overfulfill our great Five-Year Plan. When Comrade Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, announced the Five-Year Plan, many people mocked and doubted the plan’s feasibility, considering it nothing more than fantasy. These people forgot that the reality of the plan lies in the hundredfold creativity and enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people. Since the Third Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany proposed the first Five-Year Plan, the workers and peasants of the German Democratic Republic have waged a heroic struggle to fulfill the Five-Year Plan, and have achieved great successes that we can be proud of. Therefore, Comrade Walter Ulbricht was able to announce at the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany: "The results of the creative labor of the working people in the first three years of implementing the great Five-Year Plan demonstrate that the goals set by the Five-Year Plan up to now have been achieved and even exceeded."
    During the period from 1951 to 1953, a strong foundation for the metallurgical industry was established, the productive capacity of the machine manufacturing industry was greatly expanded, new production capacity was added in heavy machinery manufacturing and shipbuilding, modern agricultural machinery was manufactured, and the production of chemicals that were originally produced only in small quantities was increased. Industrial output from 1951 to 1953 was 7 percent higher than stipulated by the Five-Year Plan. In 1953, the total output value of the basic means of production industry exceeded more than double that of 1936, as did the total output value of the metal processing industry. The constant work of the Party and the trade union among the masses has strengthened the working people's belief and made them realize that they are the masters who determine our country's political and economic development. In recent years, more and more workers have realized that they themselves—the working people who hold power—are also the builders of a better life. The sixteen price reductions since 1948 have increased the actual income of the working people by 12.6 billion marks. The wage increases totaling 400 million marks and the reduction of wage taxes totaling 450 million marks implemented in 1953 greatly increased the real wages of the working people. In 1954, production also achieved further improvement. Industrial output increased by 10 percent compared to 1953. The working people of the German Democratic Republic, through continuous struggles to increase production and improve labor productivity, are constantly creating new conditions for a better life. The example of the "Progress" agricultural machinery manufacturing plant in Neustadt, Saxony, clearly illustrates how the working people can unleash their creative forces under socialist production relations.
    If the total output of the factory in 1950 is taken as 100, then by 1954 this figure had increased to 450 percent. During the same period, the number of employees increased to about 227 percent. By increasing the work efficiency of each employee to 197.7 percent during the same period, the goals of the Five-Year Plan were exceeded. This agricultural machinery manufacturing plant, which was still "losing money" in 1950 and 1951, is now a profitable enterprise that turns over huge profits to our worker-peasant state. As the factory's profitability and workers' labor productivity increased, the workers' treatment naturally improved as well. For example, the average wage of employees in the factory in 1954 was 97 percent higher than in 1950. Now this well-performing state-owned enterprise has completed its Five-Year Plan.
    Our state and trade union's concern for the happy life of the working people is also very clearly reflected in the expenditure on social insurance. In 1954, the social insurance expenditure of the German Democratic Republic exceeded 5.25 billion marks.
    In the first four years of implementing the Five-Year Plan, expenditure on culture and science increased from 1.7 billion to 3.2 billion marks.
    Conversely, in the divided part of our motherland, we can see the opposite development path. The living standards of the working people are constantly declining, exploitation is intensifying, but the profits of the monopoly giants are constantly increasing. According to statistics from West German trade unions, the minimum living expenses for a family of three require 336 marks per month. In fact, in West Germany, not to mention the millions of unemployed, 58.24 percent of employed men have a monthly net income of less than 300 marks. The exploitation of working women is even more severe. Among them, 68.1 percent have a monthly net income of less than 200 marks. The situation of the working people in West Germany is becoming increasingly unbearable, the number of strikes is increasing, and West German workers who believe in the democratic development and peaceful construction prospects of our republic are becoming more and more widespread. These achievements did not come out of thin air. This is the accomplishment of millions of working people who responded to the call of the working-class party, and heroically advanced on the road of building the foundations of socialism under the most difficult conditions. The working people of the German Democratic Republic have today established a new labor attitude.
    Innovators who have achieved outstanding results are constantly emerging in production. The names and achievements of miners Adolf Hennecke and Franz Franik, textile workers Frida Hockauf, Lotte Stampe, Paul Simon, and metallurgical workers Hesse and Werner are models for the working people of our republic. Frida Hockauf is an experienced old weaver, who used to be exploited by capitalists, but today is a "Labor Hero" in our worker-peasant state. With her call and practical actions, she explained to all workers in our industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation what path the working people should take in order to have a better life. She was one of the first to respond to the Party's call to implement new policies, and she put forward the slogan "How we work today determines how we live tomorrow!" Now, whether it is on the machines in our factories, on the locomotives of the railways, on the tractors in the fields, or in the shop windows—in short, wherever there are working people fighting for a better life in socialist competition, this slogan can be seen everywhere.
    The Twenty-first Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany pointed out that although our working people have achieved great successes and made heroic accomplishments, some state-owned enterprises have still not been profitable and are losing money. This situation is intolerable because it violates the interests of the working people. The working-class party, filled with trust, issued a call to all the working people of the republic, demanding a rapid change in this situation, so as to further develop the economy and continue to improve the people's living standards.
    The Party pointed out that it is necessary to practice strict economy in all aspects of our economy and administration. For the benefit of the working class, it is no longer possible to tolerate the situation where some enterprises consume the profits of other enterprises. In this regard, the initiatives of two metallurgical plants in Berlin, the "Heinrich Rau" state-owned heavy machinery plant in Wildau and the Berlin Treptow machine tool plant, are of particular importance. These two factories guaranteed the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany that they would not require state subsidies in 1955 and would turn over a total of 400,000 marks in profits. At the same time, they called on all the remaining loss-making enterprises in the country to learn from their example. Now many factories have expressed their intention to follow their example and have decided not to require state subsidies anymore. In this regard, as the chairman of the trade union of the "Heinrich Rau" heavy machinery plant said, the work of the workers of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory in the Soviet Union is a model for German workers.
    The German Democratic Republic is constantly growing stronger and more prosperous thanks to the strength of the working people. Today, it has already gained a respected position in the family of peace-loving peoples. This development of our republic is not tolerated by the monopoly capitalists and militarists in West Germany, who want to turn back the wheel of history. Therefore, they do not hesitate to use the most despicable means to undermine our construction and realize their sinister conspiracy to launch a new war. But all their conspiracies have been crushed by the firm will of the working people to consolidate our republic and oppose all sabotage by the enemy. Now, the workers, staff, technicians, engineers, and scientists of the German Democratic Republic are doing their utmost to make the last year of our great Five-Year Plan the most successful year. Here, the German people have the assistance of great and powerful friends like the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries.
    Under the leadership of the working-class party and in alliance with patriotic forces, the German people will also reunify their divided motherland on the path of democratic peace.

    德意志民主共和国劳动人民为争取完成五年计划而斗争
    自由德国工会联合会  全国执行委员会书记  鲁迪·基尔希纳
    德意志民主共和国的政权掌握在工人和农民手里。国营企业的职工不再是为一小撮追求利润的资本家工作，而是为他们自己、为全社会的利益而劳动。正因为如此，所以全体劳动人民都十分关怀工农国家在经济上的迅速发展和获得全面巩固。作为工人阶级最大的群众组织的工会，在这种情况下对国家的态度同在资本主义情况下是完全不同的。在德意志民主共和国，工农国家同工会之间没有对抗性的矛盾。工会的主要任务就是不断地加强他们自己的国家，防止敌人的阴谋破坏。好几代德国工人曾经为了建立这个国家进行了斗争，成千上万的工人并为此献出了他们的生命。巩固国家首先就要求：不断地发展经济，生产更多、更好、更便宜的产品，提高社会主义企业的赢利，并充分发掘国民经济的一切潜在力量。德国统一社会党和工会动员劳动人民去完成国家的国民经济计划，完成和超额完成我国伟大的五年计划。在德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记瓦尔特·乌布利希同志宣布五年计划时，曾有不少人嘲笑地怀疑这个计划的现实性，认为这不过是幻想。这些人忘记了，计划的现实性就在于广大劳动人民千百倍的创造性和积极性。自从德国统一社会党第三次代表大会提出第一个五年计划以来，德意志民主共和国工人和农民为争取完成五年计划进行了英勇的斗争，并获得了值得我们自豪的巨大成就。因此，瓦尔特·乌布利希同志就能在德国统一社会党第四次代表大会上宣布：“劳动人民在执行伟大的五年计划最初三年中的创造性劳动的结果说明，五年计划所规定到现在为止的目标已经达到并且甚至超过了。”
    在一九五一年到一九五三年这段时期内，建立了强大的冶金工业的基础，大大地扩充了机器制造业的生产力，在重型机器制造和造船方面增加了新的生产能力，制造了现代化的农业机器，并提高了那些原来只有小量生产的化学品的生产量。一九五一年到一九五三年的工业产量比五年计划所规定的要多百分之七。一九五三年基本生产资料工业总产值超过一九三六年一倍以上，金属加工工业的总产值也是如此。党和工会在群众中的经常工作巩固了劳动人民的信念，使他们认识到他们自己是决定我国政治和经济发展的主人。几年来，越来越多的工人认识到，他们自己——掌握着政权的劳动人民，也是更美好生活的建设者。一九四八年以来的十六次减低物价，使劳动人民的实际收入增加了一百二十六亿马克。一九五三年实行的总数为四亿马克的增加工资和总数为四亿五千万马克的降低工资税，大大地提高了劳动人民的实际工资。在一九五四年，生产也获得了进一步的提高。工业产量比一九五三年提高了百分之十。德意志民主共和国劳动人民通过不断地进行争取增加生产和提高劳动生产率的斗争，正在不断地为更美好的生活创造新的条件。萨克森州诺埃施塔特国营“前进”农业机器制造厂的例子很清楚地说明了：在社会主义生产关系的条件下，劳动人民能够怎样地发挥他们的创造性力量。
    如果把该厂一九五○年的总产量作为一百，那末到一九五四年时这个数字就已提高到百分之四百五十了。在同一时期内，职工人数增加到百分之二百二十七左右。通过在同样时期内每个职工的工作效率提高到百分之一百九十七点七，五年计划的目标被超过了。在一九五○年和一九五一年还是“亏本”的这个农业机器制造厂，在今天已是一个向我们工农国家上缴巨额利润的赢利企业了。随着这个工厂的赢利和工人劳动生产率的提高，工人们的待遇当然也提高了。例如，该厂职工的平均工资一九五四年比一九五○年高了百分之九十七。现在这个成绩优良的国营企业已完成了它的五年计划。
    我们的国家和工会对劳动人民幸福生活的关怀，也十分清楚地表现在社会保险事业的支出方面。一九五四年德意志民主共和国社会保险事业费就超过五十二亿五千万马克。
    在执行五年计划的前四年中，在文化和科学方面的支出就已从十七亿增加到三十二亿马克。
    相反地，在被分裂的我们祖国的另一部分，可以看到相反的发展路线。劳动人民的生活水平不断降低，剥削日益加紧，但垄断巨头的利润却不断在增加着。据西德工会的统计，一个三口之家的最低生活费用每月需要三百三十六马克。事实上在西德，不谈好几百万失业者，有百分之五十八点二四在职男人的每月纯收入不到三百马克。对劳动妇女的剥削则更加厉害。她们之中有百分之六十八点一的人每月纯收入在二百马克以下。西德劳动人民的境遇变得日益不可忍受，罢工的次数越来越多，相信我们共和国的民主发展和和平建设的远景的西德工人也越来越广泛了。这些成就并不是凭空得来的。这是几百万响应工人阶级的党的号召，在最艰苦的条件下开辟了建设社会主义基础的道路而英勇前进的劳动人民的业迹。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民今天已树立了新的劳动态度。
    在生产中不断涌现出获得杰出成就的革新者。像矿工阿道尔夫·海涅克和弗朗茨·弗朗尼克，纺织工人弗莉达·霍考夫、洛特·施坦巴赫、保尔·西门，冶金工人赫赛和维尔纳等人的名字和成就，是我们共和国劳动人民的典范。弗莉达·霍考夫是一个经验丰富的老织布女工，过去是资本家的剥削对象，今天是我们工农国家中的“劳动英雄”。她用她的号召和实际行动向我国工业、农业、商业和交通运输业的所有工人说明，为了有更美好的生活，劳动人民应该走什么路。她是最早响应党的实现新方针的号召的人之一，她提出了“今天我们怎样工作，明天我们就怎样生活！”的口号。现在，无论是在我们工厂的机器上、铁路的火车头上、农田里的拖拉机上或商店的橱窗上，——简言之，凡是有劳动人民在社会主义竞赛中为更美好生活而斗争的地方，到处都可以看到这句口号。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第二十一次全体会议指出，虽然我们劳动人民获得了巨大成就，作出了英雄的业迹，但仍有一部分国营企业一直没有赢利并且亏本。这种情况是令人不能容忍的，因为它违背了劳动人民的利益。工人阶级党充满信任地向共和国全体劳动人民发出了号召，要求迅速转变这种情况，从而使经济得到进一步的发展和人民生活水平继续提高。
    党指出，必须在我国经济和行政管理各方面厉行节约。为了工人阶级的利益，就不能再容忍一些企业消耗其他企业利润的这种情况了。在这方面，柏林的两个冶金工厂，维尔道“亨利希·劳”国营重型机器厂和柏林特莱普托工作母机厂的倡议具有特别重要的意义。这两个工厂向德国统一社会党中央委员会提出保证，在一九五五年内不要国家补助金并且上缴总共四十万马克的利润。同时，它们号召全国所有仍然亏本的企业学习他们的榜样。现在已有好些工厂表示要向他们看齐，并且已决定不再要国家的补助金。在这方面，如同“亨利希·劳”重型机器厂工会主席所说的，苏联斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂工人的工作是德国工人的榜样。
    德意志民主共和国依靠劳动人民的力量不断地壮大和强盛起来。今天它就已在爱好和平的人民的大家庭中得到了受人尊敬的地位。我们共和国的这种发展是西德垄断资本家和军国主义分子所不甘心的，他们想使历史的巨轮倒转。因而他们不惜采取最卑鄙的手段，来破坏我们的建设和实现他们发动新战争的罪恶阴谋。可是他们的所有阴谋，在劳动人民决心巩固我们共和国和反对敌人的一切阴谋破坏的坚强意志下，已遭到了粉碎。现在，德意志民主共和国的工人、职员、技术员、工程师和科学家们正在尽最大努力，把我们伟大的五年计划的最后一年变成为最成功的一年。在这里，德国人民有着像苏联、中华人民共和国和其他各人民民主国家这样伟大和强大的朋友的援助。
    德国人民在工人阶级党的领导下并和爱国力量结成同盟，也会在民主和平的道路上重新统一他们被分裂的祖国。
