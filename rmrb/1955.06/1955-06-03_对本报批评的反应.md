    Responses to Criticism from This Newspaper

    On January 4th, this newspaper reprinted the short essay "The Stink of Money Pollutes the Soul" published in the "Liaoning Daily." This article exposed the bourgeois erroneous ideological behavior of Li Yang and Han Tong, staff members of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Creation Group, who mistreated their mother (mother-in-law). After consulting with the Propaganda Department of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Supervisory Authority of the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee, the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles made a decision on May 17th regarding the mistakes committed by Li Yang and Han Tong. The decision was to give Li Yang a dismissal punishment and to give Han Tong a demotion punishment. It was also suggested that the People's Court adjudicate the issue of their maintenance obligations to their mother (mother-in-law).

    On May 18th, in the editorial "Carry the Struggle Against Hooligans and Bandits Through to the End," this newspaper criticized the Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Organs for their insufficient understanding of the serious significance of cracking down on hooligans and bandits, and for failing to organize the necessary forces to lead the struggle against hooligans and bandits. After seeing this editorial, the Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Bureau conducted an immediate review on the same day, believing that the criticism from this newspaper was in line with the actual situation and expressing their full acceptance. They decided to organize all public security cadres in the province to study this editorial, criticize complacency, examine and improve their work, and further strengthen the struggle to crack down on criminal elements.

    五月十八日本报在“把反对流氓盗匪的斗争进行到底”的社论中，曾批评江西省公安机关对打击流氓盗匪的严重意义认识不足，没有组织必要的力量去领导反对流氓盗匪的斗争。江西省公安厅在看到这一社论以后，当天就进行了检查，认为本报的批评符合实际情况，表示完全接受，并决定组织全省公安干部学习这一社论，批判麻痹思想，检查和改进工作，进一步加强打击刑事犯罪分子的斗争。
