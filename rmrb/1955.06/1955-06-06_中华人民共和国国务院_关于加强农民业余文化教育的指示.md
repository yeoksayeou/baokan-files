The basic task of current rural work is to carry out an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation, and to gradually carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture. In order to achieve this task, it is necessary not only to continuously improve farmers' socialist awareness, but also to improve farmers' cultural level. Over the past five years, the People's Government has made great efforts in farmers' spare-time cultural education and achieved certain results. However, the cultural level in rural areas is still very backward, and illiteracy still accounts for the vast majority of the rural population. If this is not gradually improved, it will become an obstacle to carrying out the mutual assistance and cooperation movement and developing agricultural production in the future. Since the publicity and education of the general task of the state during the transition period was carried out in rural areas in the winter of 1953, farmers' socialist awareness has been continuously improving, and the agricultural production mutual assistance and cooperation movement has greatly developed, and farmers' demand for culture has gradually increased and become increasingly urgent. Facts have proved that it is difficult to run agricultural production cooperatives well and continuously improve agricultural production if farmers are illiterate. It must be understood that socialism cannot be built on the basis of a large number of illiterates. Therefore, adapting to the needs of the current new situation and new tasks in rural areas, actively carrying out farmers' spare-time cultural education, eliminating illiteracy, and overcoming the backward cultural state of our country's rural areas has become an important political task at present. For this reason, the following instructions are hereby given:

I. In the future, farmers' spare-time cultural education must closely follow and closely combine with the rural mutual assistance and cooperation movement and the development of agricultural production, actively and systematically eliminate illiteracy in rural areas, and gradually improve farmers' cultural level, effectively serving the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production, and striving to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in rural areas during the transition period. In the next three to five years, we will strive to basically eliminate illiteracy among the main township cadres nationwide; in areas where agricultural production cooperatives have developed earlier and have a solid foundation, eliminate illiteracy among the majority of current cooperative members and activists and some non-member young and middle-aged people; in other areas, strive to enroll a portion of cooperative members, mutual aid team members, activists, and other young and middle-aged farmers, and gradually eliminate illiteracy among a portion of them. At the same time, those farmers who have already escaped illiteracy and primary school graduates should be organized to study in order to continue to improve their cultural level. All localities should formulate practical and feasible plans in accordance with the above guidelines and tasks and in light of local conditions. Ethnic minority areas may formulate plans for carrying out spare-time cultural education for farmers and herdsmen in accordance with the above basic spirit and local conditions. The plans and programs formulated by all localities shall be reported to the Ministry of Education for approval and then implemented.

II. Farmers' learning organizations should be gradually combined with production organizations. In recent years, some localities have established farmers' spare-time schools (including winter schools, year-round private schools, etc.) based on agricultural production cooperatives, and established study groups based on mutual aid teams, with the cooperatives and mutual aid teams uniformly managing farmers' production and learning. This practice of combining learning organizations with production organizations is correct and should become the basic direction for developing farmers' spare-time cultural education in the future. All localities should carefully summarize the experience in this area and gradually promote it. The cooperatives and mutual aid teams that have already established learning organizations should strengthen leadership and ensure that they are run well. Cooperatives and mutual aid teams whose production is on track and have the conditions for running schools should actively combine production and organize farmers to learn. As for cooperatives that have been established recently, whose production has not yet been put on track, whose foundation is not yet solid, and whose conditions for running schools are not yet sufficient, it is not advisable to be impatient and should create conditions before running them.

Advocating that cooperatives run schools does not mean that leadership can be abandoned for farmers' spare-time schools that are not run by cooperatives, allowing them to drift. On the contrary, these schools should be strengthened and run well. When the conditions for cooperatives to run schools are ripe, the cooperatives should take over and run them even better.

III. Farmers' spare-time cultural education should be adapted to the agricultural season, and farmers should be organized to study during agricultural leisure time, so that learning can be carried out without hindering production. To this end, a unified arrangement must be made for farmers' production, meetings, and study time to ensure that farmers have a certain amount of time to study. All localities must seize the opportunity of winter agricultural leisure and widely open winter schools, so that winter truly becomes the farmers' learning season. After the end of winter school, those who have the conditions for learning should be conscientiously organized to persist in year-round learning. During this period, learning time should be appropriately arranged, the pace of learning should be slowed down, and the amount of learning should be reduced. Holidays can be proactively given during busy farming seasons such as summer harvest, summer hoeing, and autumn harvest. At the same time, the organization of farmers' learning should also be adapted to the busy and idle seasons of farming and the living conditions of farmers, and different forms of centralized or decentralized learning should be adopted depending on the time, place, and person. Generally speaking, a more centralized form can be adopted in winter; after spring plowing, in addition to those who can be centralized and taught in a centralized manner, a more decentralized form should be adopted for those who cannot concentrate on learning. It is not right to inappropriately emphasize centralization or only emphasize decentralization without regard to the specific circumstances of the students.

How to effectively organize village cadres to learn culture and enable them to persist in it is a very important task. Village cadres are busy with work and have many meetings. When organizing them to study, we must adapt to this characteristic and take some effective measures, such as separate classes, groups, guaranteed teaching and learning, and individual tutoring. For the main township cadres, the method of rotational off-the-job learning can also be adopted in an effort to eliminate illiteracy among them in a relatively short period of time.

IV. The current focus of farmers' cultural education should be on literacy education for illiterates. The original illiterates should be regarded as meeting the standard of illiteracy elimination when they have finished reading all the literacy textbooks, learned to read popular books and newspapers, and learned to write simple rural application documents. If conditions permit, they should also learn abacus.

For farmers who have reached the standard of illiteracy elimination, they should still be actively organized to continue learning to consolidate their learning results. In areas with a higher level of culture and no difficulty in finding teachers, those who have reached the standard of illiteracy elimination and have higher learning requirements and better learning conditions can be organized into senior elementary school classes (groups). The cultural courses in the senior elementary school class mainly consist of Chinese and arithmetic. The Chinese course requires reaching the level of senior elementary school graduation, and the arithmetic course requires reaching the level of junior elementary school graduation. Whether or not to set up a common sense course (including production common sense and political common sense) can be determined according to the specific conditions of teachers and other factors.

For graduates of senior elementary school and junior high school who are engaged in agricultural production, they should be organized to study on their own to further improve their Chinese proficiency and calculation ability, and to increase their scientific knowledge related to agricultural production.

V. While carrying out cultural education, it is necessary to carry out political education. All farmers' spare-time schools should set up political classes to conduct socialist education and various policies and current affairs education for farmers to improve their political awareness and policy level. All localities should closely combine the central work at that time and in that place with the ideological situation of the masses to carry out political education effectively. In cultural classes, there should also be political and ideological content and production knowledge content. The tendency to carry out cultural education in isolation, divorced from politics, and the practice of only emphasizing political education and neglecting cultural and scientific knowledge are both wrong and must be prevented and corrected.

VI. Farmers' spare-time cultural education must adhere to the principle of "teaching each other by the people." People's governments at all levels and relevant parties should adopt appropriate and effective methods to widely organize and mobilize literate people to use their spare time to teach illiterate people, and to make them truly understand that this is a glorious and unshirkable task. Generally speaking, the cultural level of rural spare-time teachers is not high, and effective measures should be actively taken to help them improve their cultural and professional level. In the past, various localities have adopted teaching and research groups, short-term training courses, and other methods to train and improve spare-time teachers, and have achieved certain results. In the future, various localities can adopt appropriate methods according to specific circumstances. Among them, teaching and research groups are widely promoted and have achieved greater results, and should be regarded as an important method for improving spare-time teachers in the future. The leading organs of counties and districts should attach sufficient importance to the training and improvement of spare-time teachers and make specific arrangements. Primary school teachers should participate in this work on the condition that it does not hinder their own professional work.

Spare-time teachers should be used appropriately, and they should not be burdened too much to avoid affecting production. For those who work better and have difficulties in production and life, appropriate assistance can be provided in production and life by taking measures such as changing work for mutual assistance and reducing or exempting from duties on the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, depending on the actual local conditions. In addition, model evaluations and awards can be held regularly to encourage them.

VII. The funds for farmers' spare-time cultural education, except for the expenses of a few full-time personnel, training fees for spare-time teachers, office expenses for off-the-job learning of main township cadres, and a certain amount of bonus fees, should all be raised by the masses themselves. The methods of self-raising can include self-payment by students, collective production by students, and overall planning by cooperatives. All localities should decide on their own according to the actual local conditions and on the principle of voluntariness.

VIII. In order to implement the principles and tasks of farmers' spare-time cultural education, leadership over this work must be strengthened. Local people's committees at all levels should include this work on their work agenda, formulate plans based on local conditions, urge and supervise the education departments under their jurisdiction to actively implement the plans, and assist in solving difficult problems. The education departments of local people's committees at all levels must establish special institutions, equip them with a certain number and quality of cadres, and be responsible for managing industrial and agricultural spare-time cultural education work and doing this work well. The phenomenon of neglecting industrial and agricultural spare-time cultural education and abandoning leadership must be corrected.

Farmers' spare-time cultural education is a mass work, and all kinds of social forces must be vigorously mobilized to assist the government in carrying it out together. The Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, rural work departments, the People's Armed Forces Department, cultural centers (stations), cooperatives, and other relevant departments should actively assist the government's education administration departments in carrying out this work. The Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation should become powerful assistants and actively play their due role. In addition, intellectuals in rural areas and people who are enthusiastic about farmers' education should be mobilized to participate in this work. To this end, various localities should absorb relevant parties to try out illiteracy elimination associations in order to mobilize and organize various social forces to participate in this work. When establishing illiteracy elimination associations, a few places should be selected for experimentation first, and then gradually promoted after experience is gained.

It is hoped that all localities will earnestly implement the above instructions.

    中华人民共和国国务院
    关于加强农民业余文化教育的指示
    当前农村工作的基本任务是开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，逐步进行对农业的社会主义改造。为了实现这个任务，不仅需要不断地提高农民的社会主义觉悟，还需要提高农民的文化水平。五年来，人民政府对农民业余文化教育事业虽然作了很大的努力，取得了一定的成绩，但是农村的文化依然处在很落后的状态，文盲依然占农村人口的绝大多数，若不逐步加以改进，将成为今后开展互助合作运动、发展农业生产的一个障碍。从一九五三年冬季在农村进行国家在过渡时期的总任务的宣传教育以来，农民的社会主义觉悟已在不断地提高，农业生产互助合作运动已有很大发展，农民对文化的需要也逐渐增长和日益迫切。事实证明，要办好农业生产合作社，要不断地提高农业生产，农民没有文化是有不少困难的。必须了解，社会主义是不能建立在大量文盲的基础之上的。因此，适应当前农村新情况和新任务的需要，积极地开展农民业余文化教育，扫除文盲，克服我国农村文化落后状态，已成为当前一项重要的政治任务。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、今后农民业余文化教育，必须紧紧跟随着和密切结合着农村互助合作运动和农业生产的发展，积极地有计划地扫除农村中的文盲，并逐步提高农民的文化水平，有效地为农业的社会主义改造和发展农业生产服务，要求在过渡时期内基本上扫除农村中的青壮年文盲。在今后三、五年期间，争取在全国范围内基本上扫除主要乡干部中的文盲；在农业生产合作社发展较早和较有基础的地区，扫除大部分现有合作社社员和积极分子中的青壮年文盲及一部分非社员的青壮年文盲；在其他地区，争取一部分合作社社员、互助组组员、积极分子和其他青壮年农民中的文盲入学，并逐步扫除一部分文盲。同时，对已经摆脱文盲状态的农民和小学毕业生应当组织他们学习，以继续提高他们的文化水平。各地应当根据上述方针任务，结合当地具体情况，制定切实可行的计划。少数民族地区可以根据上述基本精神和当地具体条件，制定开展农、牧民业余文化教育的方案。各地制定的计划和方案都要报告教育部审批，然后贯彻执行。
    二、农民的学习组织应当和生产组织逐步地结合起来。近年来有些地方以农业生产合作社为基础，开办农民业余学校（包括冬学、常年民校等），以互助组为基础，建立学习小组，由合作社、互助组统一管理农民的生产和学习。这种把学习组织和生产组织结合起来的作法是正确的，应当成为今后发展农民业余文化教育事业的基本方向。各地要很好地总结这方面的经验，逐步加以推广。对已经建立学习组织的合作社和互助组，要加强领导，把它确实办好。生产已上轨道又具备办学条件的合作社、互助组，要积极地结合生产，组织农民学习。至于建社不久，生产还没有走上轨道，基础还不巩固，目前办学条件还不够的合作社，则不宜操之过急，要创造条件然后再办。
    提倡合作社办学，决不是说对那些不是合作社办的农民业余学校可以放弃领导，听其自流。相反的，对那些学校应当加强领导，切实办好，等到合作社办学条件成熟的时候，再由合作社来办，把它办得更好。
    三、农民业余文化教育要和农事季节相适应，要善于利用农事空闲组织农民学习，使学习在不妨碍生产的条件下进行。为此，必须对农民的生产、会议和学习时间作统一的安排，以保证农民有一定的时间学习。各地必须抓紧冬季农闲，广泛地开办冬学，使冬季真正成为农民的学习季节。冬学结束后，应当认真组织有条件进行学习的人坚持常年学习。在这期间，更要恰当地安排学习时间，放慢学习进度，减轻学习分量，在夏收、夏锄、秋收等农忙季节可以主动放假。同时，农民学习的组织也应当根据农事忙闲和农民生活情况，因时、因地、因人制宜，分别采取集中或分散学习的形式。一般说来，冬季可以采取比较集中的形式；春耕之后，除能够集中的仍然集中教学外，对不能集中学习的人应该采取比较分散的形式。不根据学员的具体情况，不适当地强调集中或者只强调分散的做法，都是不对的。
    如何有效地组织乡村干部学习文化，并使他们坚持下去，是一项很重要的工作。乡村干部工作忙，会议多，组织他们学习时，必须适应这一特点，采取一些有效的办法，如单独编班、编组，包教包学，个别辅导等。对主要乡干部，还可以采用轮流离职学习的办法，争取在较短的时间内扫除他们之中的文盲。
    四、当前农民文化教育应当着重对文盲进行识字教育。原来的文盲在读完全部识字课本，学会阅读通俗书报，学会写简单的农村应用文的时候，就应当看作达到扫盲标准。如果有条件，还应当学会珠算。
    对已达到扫盲标准的农民，仍然要积极地组织他们继续学习，以巩固学习成果。在文化水平较高，教师不困难的地区，可以把已达到扫盲标准的农民中学习要求较高、学习条件较好的人组成高小班
  （组）。高小班的文化课，主要是语文、算术两科。语文课要求达到高小毕业程度，算术课要求达到初小毕业程度。常识课（包括生产常识和政治常识）是否设置，可以根据教师等具体条件决定。
    对从事农业生产的高小和初中毕业生，要组织他们自学，进一步提高他们的语文程度和计算能力，并增进有关农业生产的科学知识。
    五、在进行文化教育的同时，必须进行政治教育。农民业余学校都应当设政治课，向农民进行社会主义的教育和各种政策及时事教育，以提高其政治觉悟和政策水平。各地应当密切结合当时当地的中心工作和群众的思想情况，切实有效地进行政治教育。在文化课中，也应当有政治思想内容和生产知识内容。那种孤立地进行文化教育，脱离政治的倾向，和只重视政治教育，忽视文化科学知识的做法，都是错误的，必须防止和纠正。
    六、农民业余文化教育，必须坚持“以民教民”的原则。各级人民政府和有关方面要采用适当和有效的办法，广泛组织和动员识字的人，利用业余时间来教不识字的人，并使他们真正理解到这是一个义不容辞的光荣任务。一般说，农村业余教师的文化水平是不高的，应当积极地采取有效办法帮助他们提高文化业务水平。过去各地采用教学研究小组、短期训练班等方式来训练和提高业余教师，收到了一定的成效。今后各地可以根据具体情况，适当采用。其中教学研究小组推行较广，收效较大，应当作为今后提高业余教师的一种重要方法。县、区的领导机关对于业余教师的培养提高，应当给以足够的重视，并作具体的安排。小学教师应当在不妨碍本身业务工作的条件下参加这一工作。
    对于业余教师应该适当地使用，不要使他们负担过重，以免影响生产。对那些工作较好、生产和生活有困难的人，可以根据当地实际情况，在群众自愿的原则下，采取变工互助、减免勤务等办法，在生产和生活上给以适当的帮助。此外，还可以定期地进行评模、奖励，以资鼓励。
    七、农民业余文化教育的经费，除少数专职人员的开支、业余教师训练费、主要乡干部离职学习的办公杂支以及一定的奖励费外，都应当由群众自筹。自筹的办法，可以采用学员自出、学员集体生产、合作社统筹等等。各地应当根据当地实际情况，在自愿原则下，由群众自行决定。
    八、为了贯彻执行农民业余文化教育的方针、任务，必须加强对这一工作的领导。地方各级人民委员会应当把这一工作列入工作日程，根据当地具体情况，制定计划，督促检查所属教育部门积极贯彻执行计划，并协助解决困难问题。地方各级人民委员会教育部门必须设立专门机构，配备一定数量和质量的干部，负责管理工农业余文化教育工作，并把这一工作做好。要纠正轻视工农业余文化教育工作、放弃领导的现象。
    农民业余文化教育是群众性的工作，必须大力动员各种社会力量，协助政府共同进行。青年团、妇联、农村工作部门、人民武装部、文化馆（站）、合作社等有关部门都应当积极地协助政府教育行政部门开展这一工作。青年团、妇联更应当成为有力的助手，积极发挥其应有的作用。此外，还要动员农村的知识分子，热心农民教育事业的人，参加这
  一工作。为此，各地应该吸收有关方面试办扫除文盲协会，以便动员和组织各种社会力量，参加这一工作。在创立扫盲协会的时候，应当先选择几处地方作试验，待取得经验后再逐步推广。
    以上指示，务希各地切实贯彻执行。
