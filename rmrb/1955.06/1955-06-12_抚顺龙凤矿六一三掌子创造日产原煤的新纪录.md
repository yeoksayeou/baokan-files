Fushun City, The No. 613 stope of the Longfeng Mine in Fushun City created a new record of producing 1,103 tons of raw coal in a single day on May 28th.

The reason why the No. 613 stope was able to create a new record for coal mining was mainly due to the close unity between shifts and the conscientious implementation of the "three retention system" (retaining the coal face, retaining timber, and retaining yellow mud), as well as the promotion of advanced deep drilling experience. The close cooperation of various departments such as transportation and electromechanical also played a significant role. On May 28th, after the first shift entered the stope, coal was quickly mined due to the good preparation work of the previous shift. A total of 424 tons of coal were produced in eight hours, exceeding the usual daily coal output of this stope. After twenty-four hours of work, eighty-eight workers mined a total of 1,103 tons of coal on the premise of ensuring safety, creating the highest record of the Longfeng Mine after adopting the drilling and blasting method of coal mining. The coal mining rate per direct coal miner reached 16.7 tons, exceeding the national plan by 18.6 percent.

    抚顺龙凤矿六一三掌子创造日产原煤的新纪录
    抚顺市龙凤矿六一三掌子在五月二十八日这一天创造了日产原煤一千一百零三吨的新纪录。
    六一三掌子所以能够创造采煤的新纪录，主要是因为班和班之间紧密团结，认真贯彻了三留制度
  （留眼、留坑木、留黄泥），并推广了深打眼的先进经验。运输、机电等各部门的紧密配合也起了很大作用。五月二十八日这一天，当第一班进入掌子以后，由于上一班准备工作做得好，很快就开采出煤炭，八小时共出煤四百二十四吨，超过了这个掌子平常一昼夜的煤产量。经过二十四小时的劳动，八十八个工人在确保安全的基础上，共采煤一千一百零三吨，创造了龙凤矿采用打眼放炮采煤法后的最高纪录。直接采煤工每人采煤率达到十六点七吨，超过国家计划百分之十八点六。
