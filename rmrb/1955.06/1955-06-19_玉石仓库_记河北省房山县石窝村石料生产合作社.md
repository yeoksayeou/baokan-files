"Jade Warehouse"
    -- A Record of the Shiwowo Village Stone Material Production Cooperative in Fangshan County, Hebei Province
　　Liang Haoran
    White Stone Mountain—this "Jade Warehouse" in Fangshan County, Hebei Province, which was developed as early as 722 AD (the tenth year of the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty), how many beautiful buildings have people built with it from ancient times to the present!
    The jade railings of Little Western Paradise, the carved stone statues of Leiyin Cave, the Thousand Buddha Pillars, and other artistic carvings have not weathered at all after more than 1,230 years. The Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, the Summer Palace... and the Eastern Tombs in Zunhua County, the Western Tombs in Yixian County, and the Thirteen Tombs in Changping County in Beijing, which of these historical sites is not built with the white jade stone from here? Even the stone tools used by farmers in the surrounding dozens of counties are made from it.
    The Kuomintang reactionaries destroyed this stone quarry. They conscripted soldiers and demanded grain, forcing the stone craftsmen to sell their tools in pain, unable to eat their fill or keep warm.
      In 1948, White Stone Mountain was liberated, and the "Jade Warehouse" returned to the embrace of the people. From then on, the crisp sound of chiseling stone rang out again in this ancient stone quarry.
    In 1951, more than 180 stone craftsmen formed the Shiwowo Village Stone Material Production Cooperative, following the direction pointed out by the Communist Party. A guerrilla fighter named Yang Ruisheng, who had fought against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary troops on White Stone Mountain, came here to lead the stone production.
    The Stone Material Production Cooperative received strong support from the Party and the government. The state sent staff and allocated loans. The original small stone quarry working face was expanded into three stone quarries, and the number of cooperative members increased to more than 540.
    The Stone Material Production Cooperative undertook a glorious task as soon as it was established. They supplied accessories for manufacturing electrical equipment and mechanical equipment for industrial construction; supplied stone for the construction of the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Shanghai. Now they are supplying all the relief sculptures, railings, balusters, bracing bones, and ground coverings for the Monument to the People's Revolutionary Heroes in front of Tiananmen Square in Beijing. In supporting agricultural production, they produced 26,957 pieces of stone tools last year alone, and this year they have added more than ten new products according to the needs of the farmers.
      The craftsmen on White Stone Mountain are no longer hired laborers building palaces and temples for feudal rulers. They deeply understand that their labor achievements are a part of the entire national construction. Therefore, whenever they receive a task, they actively complete it. Last May, when quarrying stone for the Soviet Exhibition Center, it was raining, and the stone quarry was filled with water. More than 500 cooperative members implemented a scientific division of labor, with some bailing water and others quarrying stone. Many people stood in the water to work. In this way, the task of quarrying 150 cubic meters of white marble was completed on schedule.
    After the stone craftsmen of White Stone Mountain were organized, production increased, and the standard of living also improved unprecedentedly. Now each stone craftsman earns more than two yuan a day, and every family lives a good life.
    Chairman Mao's brilliance shines on White Stone Mountain. Shiwowo—this remote mountain village is thriving. The village has a sanatorium and a supply and marketing cooperative. Big trucks constantly transport industrial products from the cities and agricultural products from the plains to here. This small mountain village is like a bustling little city. The stone craftsmen feel glorious and proud to be born in such an era. Liu Yongrong, an old carving craftsman in his sixties, in order to express his gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao, carved a stone statue of Chairman Mao day and night. Recently, he also completed two relief stone tables, one made of white marble and the other made of artemisia green stone. In addition to many lifelike flowers, plants, and birds carved on them, there is also a Young Pioneer wearing a red scarf. He sticks out his chest and raises the five-star red flag high. This reflects the old craftsman's love for the motherland and the next generation.
    Recently, another exciting piece of news reached Shiwowo Village: a survey team came to the foot of White Stone Mountain. Soon, a small hydroelectric power station will be built here. With electricity, people in the mountain valleys can also use electric lights; machines can also be installed in the stone quarries, and electricity can be used to mine this beautiful jade stone.
      Yang Ruisheng, the guerrilla fighter of eight years ago, now the director of the Stone Material Production Cooperative, is so happy as the infinitely beautiful prospect flashes through his mind! He said: "This inexhaustible 'Jade Warehouse' also contains infinite happiness."

    “玉石仓库”
    ——记河北省房山县石窝村石料生产合作社
　　梁浩然
    白石山——这个早在公元七百二十二年（唐朝开元十年）就开发了的河北省房山县的“玉石仓库”，从古至今，人们用它来建筑了多少优美的建筑物啊！
    小西天的玉石栏杆，雷音洞的雕刻石像，千佛柱等艺术雕刻作品，经过了一千二百三十多年还没有一点风化。在北京的天安门、故宫、天坛、颐和园……还有遵化县东陵，易县西陵，昌平县的十三陵，那一个古迹不是用这里的白玉石料？就连周围几十个县农民使用的石具也是用它制成的。
    国民党反动派破坏了这个石塘，他们抓兵要粮，逼得石匠们忍痛卖掉了工具，吃不饱，穿不暖。
      一九四八年，白石山解放了，“玉石仓库”回到人民的怀抱里。从此，这古老的石塘里又响起了清脆的凿石声。
    一九五一年，有一百八十多名石匠按照共产党指出的方向，组成了石窝村石料生产合作社。一个名叫杨瑞生的曾经在白石山上打击蒋介石反动军队的游击队员，来到这里领导石料生产。
    石料生产合作社，得到了党和政府的大力支持。国家派来了工作人员，拨给了贷款，原来仅一个小石塘的工作面，开拓成了三个石塘，社员增到五百四十多人。
    石料生产合作社，一建立就担负了光荣的任务。他们供应了工业建设方面制造电器设备、机械设备的配件；供应了建筑北京苏联展览馆、上海中苏友好大厦的石料，如今正供应着北京天安门前人民革命英雄纪念塔的全部浮雕、栏板、望柱、抱骨、地伏等石料。在支持农业生产方面，去年一年就生产了二万六千九百五十七件石具，今年又根据农民的需要，增加十多种新产品。
      白石山上的匠人们，不再是为封建统治者修筑宫殿、庙宇的雇工了。他们深深懂得自己的劳动成果是整个国家建设的一部分，因此，每当他们接到一项任务时，都是积极地去完成。去年五月，为建筑苏联展览馆开采石头的时候，正遇下雨，石塘积满了水。五百多社员实行科学分工，掏水的掏水，开石的开石。许多人站在水里工作。就这样，按期完成了一百五十立方公尺汉白玉的开采任务。
    白石山的石匠组织起来以后，生产提高了，生活水平也空前地提高了。现在每个石匠一天得二元多的工资，家家生活都过得不错。
    毛主席的光辉照亮了白石山，石窝——这个偏僻的山村繁盛起来了，村里有了疗养室和供销合作社。大汽车不断地把城市里的工业品，平原的农产品，运到这里来。这个小山村，活像一个热闹的小城市。石匠们为自己生长在这样的时代感到光荣和骄傲，六十多岁的老雕刻匠刘永荣，为了表示他对党和毛主席的感激心情，日夜不停地精心雕刻了一尊毛主席石像。最近，他又完成了两张浮雕的石几，一张是汉白玉石做的，一张是艾叶青石做的，上面雕刻的除了许多栩栩如生的花草、小鸟以外，还有一个佩戴红领巾的少先队员，他挺着胸脯，高举起五星红旗。这反映了老匠人对祖国对后一代的热爱心情。
    最近又有一个振奋人心的消息传到了石窝村：一个勘测小组来到白石山下。不久，这里要建立起一座小型水力发电站。有了电，山沟里的人们也可以用上电灯了；石塘里也能安上机器，用电力来开采这美丽的玉石了。
      杨瑞生，这个八年前的游击队员，现在的石料生产合作社主任，当着无限美好的远景在他脑子里掠过时，他是多么高兴啊！他说：“这取之不尽，用之不竭的‘玉石仓库’，也蕴藏着无穷的幸福。”
