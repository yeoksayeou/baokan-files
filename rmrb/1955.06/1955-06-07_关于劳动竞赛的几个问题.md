Regarding Several Questions Regarding Labor Emulation
Lai Ruoyu

I

Capitalist production relies on the ruthless exploitation of the working class and all working people to develop, while socialist production must rely on the conscious efforts of the working class and the broad masses of working people. Only by relying on the conscious efforts of the working class can socialism be built. The responsibility of the leading organs lies in realistically planning the goals of struggle, bringing into play the initiative and creativity of the masses, and giving the masses help, encouragement, and guidance, leading them to achieve these goals.

Labor emulation is the best way to bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses for the cause of socialist construction, the best way to organize the strength and wisdom of the masses to advance towards a common goal, and the best way to continuously improve labor productivity and ensure the comprehensive completion of state plans. In a word, it is a fundamental method for building socialism.

The intelligence and talent of the working class and other working masses are endless. The old society trampled and suffocated their intelligence and talent. Only after liberation can the working class truly bring their talents into play. Only by understanding this, only by truly having the thought of infinite trust in the working masses, can we deeply understand that labor emulation is the basic method for building socialism.

II

Since liberation, labor emulations have been launched one after another in socialist enterprises. In some enterprises, this competition even had a spontaneous nature in the early days of liberation.

Why can labor emulation develop rapidly and even spontaneously in socialist enterprises? This is because after liberation, the status of the working class has undergone fundamental changes, that is, from the position of being oppressed and enslaved to becoming the masters of the country. Because the status of the working class has undergone fundamental changes, the nature of labor has also undergone fundamental changes. Before liberation, they worked for capitalists, while after liberation, they worked for the country, for the entire society, and for themselves. In this way, labor becomes a glorious thing.

More importantly, under the people's democratic system, the interests of the state and the immediate interests of the masses are consistent. Since liberation, the material and cultural living standards of the masses have indeed been improved. No matter how many shortcomings still exist in our work, with the restoration and development of the national economy, the material and cultural living conditions of the masses are always gradually improving. The masses experience from their own lives that the country's production cause is closely related to their own immediate interests. In addition, after liberation, the state is also concerned about the cultural and technical education of the working masses, and the cultural and technical level of the working masses is rapidly improving. These are the reasons why labor emulation has been able to develop rapidly since liberation.

Then, does it mean that labor emulation can develop spontaneously without leadership? Of course not. The enthusiasm of the masses aroused by the tide of the people's revolution and some of the conditions it creates cannot be sustained in a state of drift. Therefore, labor emulation must be actively led.

How should we further promote the development of labor emulation?

Yes, to make labor emulation continuously develop forward, we must always pay attention to the ideological education of the staff and workers, and continuously improve the level of awareness and organization of the staff and workers. The enthusiasm and labor discipline of the masses are largely determined by the level of awareness. The main manifestation of the masses' awareness is the understanding of the overall and long-term interests of the working class, and the understanding of the consistency between the interests of the state and the interests of the masses. If the masses' awareness is continuously improved, they will treat the country's production cause with a responsible spirit, give full play to a high degree of initiative and enthusiasm in labor production, and have strict discipline.

However, relying solely on ideological education is far from enough. The ideological awareness of the masses can never be separated from a certain material basis. The broad masses understand problems based on their own personal experiences, and the broad masses should be educated in combination with their own immediate interests. If the broad masses had not obtained political rights and improvements in material and cultural life since liberation, the broad masses would never believe that the interests of the state are consistent with their own interests, and it would be difficult to believe in the bright future of socialism. All propaganda about a beautiful future would be regarded by the masses as mere rhetoric, or even as a kind of deception. It is precisely because the broad masses have obtained political rights and improvements in material and cultural life since liberation that the broad masses regard the country's construction cause as their own cause.

For the above reasons, the principle of material encouragement, that is, more pay for more work, must be implemented in labor emulation, and the masses must be concerned about the results of labor and the development of production from the perspective of material interests. "Every important department of the national economy must be built on the basis of personal interests." (Lenin: "The New Economic Policy and the Tasks of the Political Education Department"). Without appropriate material encouragement, labor emulation cannot be carried out, and even if it is carried out, it cannot be sustained.

Does demanding material encouragement reflect the "backward" emotions of the masses? Definitely not. Distribution according to work is the economic law of socialist society. In socialist enterprises, distribution according to work ensures that every worker cares about the results of their labor from the perspective of personal material interests, and it is a powerful force for promoting the development of productive forces. Distribution according to work stimulates the improvement of labor productivity and at the same time increases the welfare of production workers. Therefore, in labor emulation, we must pay attention to material encouragement. This material encouragement is mainly reflected in the wage system and the reward system. The reason why piece-rate wage system and time-based bonus wage system are a progressive form of wage is because they implement the principle of distribution according to work, and they closely combine the interests of the state with the personal interests of production workers. The reason why egalitarian wage system and unreasonable reward methods are not good is because they lack encouragement for production. Material encouragement closely related to the development of socialist production cannot be regarded as economism. The characteristic of economism lies in unilaterally emphasizing personal economic interests and adopting an indifferent attitude towards the country's political struggles and the country's production cause. It is a great misunderstanding to regard material encouragement based on the premise of improving socialist production as economism.

Of course, material encouragement should not be separated from political education, but should be combined with material encouragement to carry out ideological education, to improve the awareness and organizational level of the masses, to make the staff and workers more deeply understand the consistency between the interests of the state and the interests of the individual, and to strive for socialism and communism with more confidence.

In order to make labor emulation continuously develop forward, we must also pay great attention to the cultural education and technical education of the masses. In modern production, it is not enough for production workers to have enthusiasm, they must also have a certain level of culture and technology. The improvement and enhancement of production technology is the most convenient way to improve labor productivity, and the improvement and enhancement of production technology is inseparable from the improvement of cultural level.

It is wrong to simply understand labor emulation as physical assaults. Although labor emulation does not absolutely exclude physical assaults. For example, in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, during the period of fighting floods in 1954..., many staff and workers in production departments and transportation departments had assaults, and this kind of assault was necessary. However, under normal circumstances, physical assaults are harmful. First of all, it is unfavorable to the health of the workers, it is unfavorable to normal enterprise management, and even has certain adverse effects on production equipment, product quality, product cost, and technical safety. Under normal circumstances, labor emulation should focus on the improvement and enhancement of production technology, that is, focus on learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, promoting our own effective advanced experience, and carrying out rationalization proposals to solve problems in production. Only in this way can we improve labor productivity and comprehensively complete the state plan.

III

Competition is different from rivalry. Rivalry is mutual exclusion and mutual attack, striving to defeat others to establish one's own rule; labor emulation is when the advanced help the backward to achieve universal improvement. Capitalism develops in rivalry, while socialism must be built through labor emulation.

In labor emulation, we must oppose the bad tendencies of hindering others, being jealous of others, and attacking others, which is a reflection of bourgeois ideology. In labor emulation, we must implement the principle of collectivist cooperation and the principle of the advanced helping the backward.

Collectivist cooperation is one of the basic characteristics of labor emulation. Cooperation should be multi-faceted. Technicians, staff, and workers should cooperate; older workers and young workers, old workers and new workers should cooperate; skilled workers and apprentices should cooperate; upper and lower processes should cooperate; front and rear work shifts should cooperate; brother factories and mines should cooperate; different industries should cooperate... We must prepare favorable conditions for others and never create difficulties for others. Without a full spirit of cooperation, there can be no universal improvement.

Another characteristic of labor emulation is that the advanced help the backward. No matter when, there are always advanced and backward in work. For those who are backward in work, we must never discriminate or attack, but must patiently provide assistance. The difference between advanced and backward can never be solved by means of attack. Helping the backward to reach the level of the advanced is a constant and important task. Without paying attention to this aspect of work, there can be no real labor emulation.

Of course, the advanced level that has been achieved is not impossible to break through. In labor emulation, more advanced workers and units are constantly emerging, and some people and some units are always lagging behind. Encouraging the advanced, helping the backward, and continuously improving and advancing the entire work is the fundamental requirement of labor emulation.

In order to implement the principle of cooperation and the principle of the advanced helping the backward in labor emulation, so as to achieve universal improvement, we must also carry out mass criticism and self-criticism. The process of labor emulation is also a process of criticism and self-criticism, a process of communist education, a process of continuous improvement of the awareness and organizational level of the masses, and a process of fully bringing into play the initiative and enthusiasm of the masses.

IV

The organization of labor emulation must be carried out in accordance with the spirits and principles mentioned above. On the issue of organizing labor emulation, the following issues are important:

First, the collective contract. The collective contract is the outline for organizing labor emulation. It should stipulate the requirements of the enterprise administration for the staff and workers, and should also stipulate the requirements of the staff and workers for the enterprise administration, and should also stipulate the necessary measures taken to achieve these requirements. According to the collective contract, each workshop and group should stipulate its own guarantee conditions and specific methods.

With a collective contract, there is a unified goal of struggle, and there is a standard for checking work.

The collective contract also embodies the consistency between the interests of the state and the immediate interests of the masses. When the various production targets stipulated in the collective contract are completed, the requirements of the masses for the enterprise administration must also be realized, which specifically embodies the principle of gradually improving the material and cultural life of staff and workers on the basis of developing production, which prompts the masses to care about the results of their labor from the perspective of material interests.

Of course, when the enterprise management work has not yet been formalized and various indicators are not very accurate, it is difficult to sign a collective contract. However, generally speaking, there are currently many factories and mines that can sign collective contracts, and the problem is that many comrades do not pay enough attention to collective contracts. This phenomenon of not paying attention to collective contracts must be overcome.

Second, the contact contract. The contact contract is a kind of mutual guarantee contract signed between the upper and lower processes, between departments and workshops, and between other units that are interrelated in production. If mutual contact contracts are signed between the relevant units according to the collective contract (that is, according to the entire planned targets of the enterprise), the spirit of cooperation can be fully brought into play, and the impact of a problem in one link on the entire production can be avoided.

Third, mass production meetings. Mass production meetings are a good form of solving production problems with collective and cooperative forces. At the production meeting, the shortcomings, errors, and weak links in the work should be exposed, and in particular, effective solutions should be studied for these problems. The solution of these problems must rely on the close cooperation between technicians, staff, and workers, and the close cooperation between all staff and workers and brother factories and mines.

Various forms of mass production meetings have become a fairly common system in many factories and mines, but in general, this system is not sound enough, and the content of the meetings is not substantial enough. The current problem is to further improve this system, accurately grasp the problems in the work, carry out mass brewing, make full preparations, and then hold a meeting to discuss.

Fourth, systematically and organizationally study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, promote the effective advanced experience of our country, and carry out rationalization proposals in response to the problems in the work.

Fifth, regularly conduct summaries, evaluations, and awards. Summaries and evaluations are by no means a simple evaluation, but a kind of criticism and self-criticism, a kind of promotion of advanced experience and help for the backward work. When summarizing and evaluating, the advanced experience of advanced units and advanced workers must be summarized and promoted; at the same time, the reasons why the backward are backward must also be pointed out to help them overcome the shortcomings in their work. Spiritual and material rewards must be given to advanced workers and advanced units to encourage the progress of staff and workers.

V

Since liberation, my country's labor emulation has been carried out under the unified leadership of the Party. The labor emulation in each period has had certain clear goals of struggle, and the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses are concentrated on these goals, which has played an extremely important role in ensuring the completion of the national construction plan. But along what road should the labor emulation in the future develop forward? I think the most important are the following two points:

First, the improvement of labor emulation is accompanied by the improvement of technical equipment and the technical level of staff and workers. The development of labor emulation will inevitably lead to the improvement and enhancement of technical equipment and the technical level of staff and workers. At the same time, the improvement of technical equipment and the technical level of staff and workers also promotes the progress of labor emulation. Therefore, in labor emulation, we must conscientiously study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the existing effective advanced experience of our country, and seek continuous improvement and enhancement of production technology.

Second, the development and improvement of labor emulation is accompanied by the opposition to various forms of bureaucracy and conservative thought. It is common for the beneficial initiatives of the masses to be attacked and suppressed. Therefore, in labor emulation, we must oppose various forms of bureaucracy and conservative thought, we must fully bring into play the initiative of the masses, and we must oppose artificially restricting labor emulation with frames.

    关于劳动竞赛的几个问题
    赖若愚
    一
    资本主义的生产是依靠对于工人阶级和全体劳动人民的残酷剥削发展起来的，社会主义的生产则必须依靠工人阶级和广大劳动人民自觉的努力。只有依靠工人阶级自觉的努力，社会主义才能建成。领导机关的责任，就在于实事求是地规划奋斗目标，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，并给群众以帮助、鼓励和指导，领导群众来实现这些奋斗目标。
    劳动竞赛是发挥群众对于社会主义建设事业的积极性、创造性的最好方法，是把群众的力量和智慧组织起来向着一个共同的目标前进的最好方法，是不断地提高劳动生产率、保证全面完成国家计划的最好方法。一句话，是建设社会主义的基本方法。
    工人阶级以及其他劳动群众的聪明才智是无穷无尽的。旧社会把他们的聪明才智蹂躏和窒息了。只有在解放以后，工人阶级才能真正发挥他们的才智。只有懂得这一点，只有真正具有对于劳动群众无限信赖的思想，才能深刻了解劳动竞赛是建设社会主义的基本方法。
    二
    解放以来，在社会主义的企业里，都先后展开了劳动竞赛。这种竞赛在解放初期在有些企业里甚至是带有自发性质的。
    为什么在社会主义企业里，劳动竞赛会迅速地甚至自发地开展起来呢？这是因为解放以后，工人阶级的地位起了根本的变化，即由被压迫、被奴役的地位变成了国家的主人。由于工人阶级的地位起了根本的变化，所以劳动的性质也起了根本变化。解放以前是为资本家劳动，而解放以后是为国家劳动、为整个社会劳动、为自己劳动。这样，劳动就成为光荣的事情。
    更重要的是在人民民主制度下，国家利益和群众的切身的利益是一致的。解放以后，群众的物质和文化生活水平确实得到了改善。不管我们的工作中还存在着多少缺点，但是随着国民经济的恢复和发展，群众的物质和文化生活状况总是在逐步地提高。群众从自己切身生活中体验到国家的生产事业是和自己的切身利益密切相关的。此外，解放以后，国家对于工人群众的文化、技术教育也是关心的，工人群众的文化、技术水平在迅速地提高。这些都是解放以来劳动竞赛得以迅速开展起来的原因。
    那末，是不是说，劳动竞赛可以不加领导，自发地向前发展呢？当然不是。人民革命的浪潮所激发起来的群众热情和它所造成的某些条件，在自流的状态下是不能持久的。因此，劳动竞赛必须加以积极的领导。
    我们应当怎样来进一步推动劳动竞赛的开展呢？
  　是的，要使劳动竞赛不断地向前发展，就必须经常注意对于职工群众的思想教育，不断地提高职工群众的觉悟程度和组织程度。群众的劳动热情和劳动纪律，在很大程度上是决定于觉悟程度的高低的。群众觉悟程度的主要表现，就是对于工人阶级的整体利益和长远利益的认识，就是对于国家利益和群众利益的一致性的认识。群众的觉悟如果不断地提高，就会以负责的精神对待国家的生产事业，在劳动生产中发挥出高度的主动性、积极性，就会有严整的纪律。
    但是，仅仅靠思想教育还是十分不够的。群众的思想觉悟决不能离开一定的物质基础，广大群众是根据自己的切身经验来理解问题的，应该结合群众的切身利益来教育广大群众。如果解放以来广大群众没有得到政治上的权利和物质、文化生活的改善，广大群众就决不会相信国家利益和自己的利益是一致的，也很难相信社会主义的美好前途，一切对于美好将来的宣传，就会被群众认为是一种浮词夸语，甚或被认为是一种欺骗。正因为解放以来广大群众得到了政治权利和物质、文化生活的改善，所以广大群众才把国家的建设事业当做自己的事业来看待。
    由于上述原因，所以在劳动竞赛中必须贯彻物质鼓励即多劳多得的原则，必须使群众从物质利益上关心劳动的结果和生产的发展。“要把国民经济底每一个重要部门，都建立在个人利益关系的基础上。”（列宁：“新经济政策与政治教育部底任务”）。没有适当的物质鼓励，劳动竞赛是开展不起来的，即使开展起来，也不可能坚持下去。
    要求物质鼓励是不是反映群众的“落后”情绪呢？决不是的。按劳分配是社会主义社会的经济法则。在社会主义企业中，按劳分配保证每个工作者从个人物质利益上关心自己的劳动结果，它是推进生产力发展的强大力量。按劳分配刺激劳动生产率的提高，同时增进生产工作者的福利。所以在劳动竞赛中，必须注意物质鼓励。这种物质鼓励主要表现在工资制度和奖励制度方面。计件工资制和计时奖励工资制之所以是一种进步的工资形式，就因为它们贯彻着按劳分配的原则，它们把国家利益和生产工作者的个人利益紧密地结合了起来。平均主义的工资制度和不合理的奖励办法所以不好，就因为它对于生产缺乏鼓励作用。同社会主义生产事业发展有密切联系的物质鼓励，不能视为经济主义。经济主义的特点，在于片面地强调个人的经济利益，对国家的政治斗争和国家的生产事业则采取漠不关心的态度。把以提高社会主义生产为前提的物质鼓励视为经济主义，是一种极大的误解。
    当然，物质鼓励不应当脱离政治教育，而是要结合物质鼓励来进行思想教育，来提高群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，使职工群众更深刻地认识国家利益和个人利益的一致性，更有信心地为社会主义、共产主义而奋斗。
    为了使劳动竞赛不断地向前发展，还必须十分注意群众的文化教育和技术教育。在近代化的生产事业上，生产工作者光有热情是不够的，还必须有一定的文化、技术水平。生产技术的改进和提高，是提高劳动生产率的最便捷的途径，而生产技术的改进和提高同文化水平的提高是不可分离的。
    把劳动竞赛简单地理解为体力的突击是错误的。虽然劳动竞赛并不绝对排除体力的突击。例如在抗美援朝运动中，在一九五四年与洪水搏斗的时期……，许多生产部门和运输部门的职工就曾突击过，这种突击是必要的。但是，在一般情况下，体力的突击是有害的。它首先对于劳动者的健康是不利的，对于正常的企业管理是不利的，甚至对于生产设备、产品质量、产品成本、技术安全都有一定的不良影响。一般情况下的劳动竞赛，应当着重生产技术的改进和提高，即着重在学习苏联先进经验、推广我们自己的行之有效的先进经验、开展合理化建议来解决生产中的问题。这样才能提高劳动生产率，全面地完成国家计划。
    三
    竞赛同竞争不同。竞争是互相排斥，互相打击，力求打倒别人以确立自己的统治；劳动竞赛则是先进者帮助落后者，以达到普遍的提高。资本主义是在竞争中发展起来的，社会主义则必须通过劳动竞赛建设起来。
    在劳动竞赛中必须反对妨碍别人、嫉妒别人、打击别人的恶劣倾向，这是资产阶级思想的反映。在劳动竞赛中必须贯彻集体主义的合作原则，贯彻先进者帮助落后者的原则。
    集体主义的合作，是劳动竞赛的基本特征之一。合作应当是多方面的。技术人员、职员和工人要合作；老年工人和青年工人、老工人和新工人要合作；技术工人和徒工要合作；上下工序之间要合作；前后工作班之间要合作；兄弟厂矿之间要合作；不同产业之间要合作，……要为别人准备有利条件，决不能为别人制造困难。没有充分的合作精神，就不可能有普遍的提高。
    劳动竞赛的另一个特征，就是先进者帮助落后者。无论在什么时候，工作中总有先进者和落后者。对于工作中的落后者，决不可以歧视和打击，而是必须耐心地予以帮助。先进同落后的差别决不是可以用打击的办法解决的。帮助落后者达到先进者的水平，是一个经常重要的工作。不注意这方面的工作，就不可能有真正的劳动竞赛。
    当然，已经达到的先进水平并不是不可能突破的，在劳动竞赛中，更先进的工作者和单位总是不断出现的，一部分人和一部分单位总是落在后边的。鼓励先进者，帮助落后者，使整个工作不断地提高，不断地前进，这是劳动竞赛的根本要求。
    为了在劳动竞赛中贯彻合作的原则和先进者帮助落后者的原则，从而达到普遍提高，还必须开展群众性的批评和自我批评。劳动竞赛的过程，同时也是批评和自我批评的过程，是共产主义教育的过程，是群众的觉悟程度和组织程度不断提高的过程，是充分发挥群众的主动性、积极性的过程。
    四
    劳动竞赛的组织工作，必须根据前边所说的那些精神和原则来进行。在劳动竞赛的组织问题上，以下几个问题是重要的：
    第一、集体合同。集体合同是组织劳动竞赛的纲领。它应当规定企业行政方面对于职工群众的要求，也应当规定职工群众对于企业行政方面的要求，并且应当规定为了达到这些要求所采取的必要的措施。根据集体合同，每个车间、小组都应当规定自己的保证条件和具体办法。
    有了集体合同，就有了统一的奋斗目标，就有了检查工作的标准。
    集体合同也体现着国家利益和群众切身利益的一致性。集体合同所规定的各种生产指标完成了的时候，群众对于企业行政方面的要求也要实现，这就具体表现了在发展生产的基础上逐步改善职工物质、文化生活的原则，这就促使群众从物质利益上关心自己的劳动结果。
    当然，在企业管理工作还没有走上正规、各种指标还很不准确的时候，订立集体合同是有一定困难的。但是，一般说来，目前有很多厂矿企业是可以订立集体合同的，问题在于许多同志对于集体合同还不够重视。这种不重视集体合同的现象必须克服。
    第二、联系合同。联系合同是上下工序之间、科室和车间之间以及其他生产上互相关联的单位之间订立的一种相互保证的合同。如果根据集体合同
  （亦即根据企业的整个计划指标）在各有关单位之间订立了相互的联系合同，就可以充分发挥合作精神，就可以避免由于一个环节的问题影响整个生产。
    第三、群众生产会议。群众生产会议是以集体的、合作的力量解决生产问题的一种良好形式。在生产会议上，应当揭发工作中的缺点、错误和薄弱环节，特别应当针对这些问题，研究有效的解决办法。这些问题的解决，必须依靠技术人员、职员和工人之间的亲密合作，依靠全体职工群众以及兄弟厂矿之间的亲密合作。
    各种形式的群众生产会议，在许多厂矿企业中，已经成为一种相当普遍的制度了，但一般地说，这种制度还不够健全，会议的内容还不够充实。目前的问题在于进一步健全这一制度，准确地抓住工作中的问题，进行群众性的酝酿，作充分的准备，然后再开会讨论。
    第四、系统地、有组织地针对工作中的问题，学习苏联先进经验，推广我国的行之有效的先进经验，开展合理化建议。
    第五、定期地进行总结、评比、奖励。总结、评比决不是单纯的评定，而是一种批评和自我批评，是一种推广先进经验和帮助落后的工作。总结、评比的时候，必须把先进单位和先进工作者的先进经验总结出来，加以推广；同时，还必须指出落后者所以落后的原因，帮助他们克服工作中的缺点。对于先进工作者和先进单位，必须予以精神的和物质的奖励，以鼓舞职工群众的前进心。
    五
    解放以来，我国的劳动竞赛是在党的统一领导下开展起来的，每个时期的劳动竞赛，都有一定的明确的奋斗目标，群众的热情和智慧是集中于这些目标的，这对于保证完成国家建设计划起了极为重要的作用。可是今后的劳动竞赛应当沿着什么道路向前发展呢？我想最主要的有以下两点：
    第一，劳动竞赛的提高是和技术设备、职工技术水平的提高相伴随的。劳动竞赛的开展，必然导致技术设备、职工技术水平的改进和提高。同时技术设备、职工技术水平的提高，也推动劳动竞赛前进。因此，在劳动竞赛中必须认真学习苏联的先进经验和我国已有的行之有效的先进经验，求得生产技术的不断改进和提高。
    第二，劳动竞赛的发展和提高，是和反对各种形式的官僚主义、保守思想相伴随的。群众有益的倡议遭受打击和压抑的情况是常有的。因此，在劳动竞赛中必须反对各种形式的官僚主义和保守思想，必须充分发挥群众的主动精神，反对把劳动竞赛用人为的框子来加以限制。
