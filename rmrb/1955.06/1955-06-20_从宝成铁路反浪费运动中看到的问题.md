    Problems Seen from the Anti-Waste Movement on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    Ye Xin
    The workers of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway have launched an anti-waste movement since April. Initial inspections have revealed serious waste of manpower, materials, and machinery. It is estimated that there were more than a thousand completely redundant laborers in the first quarter of this year alone. The value of materials stockpiled in just one engineering section exceeds 600,000 yuan. More than 700 bags of cement were wasted in the Shensha River Bridge foundation due to increased cement ratios. The utilization rate of machinery last year was only 24 percent, and only 30 percent in the first quarter of this year; and many of the so-called "utilized" machines were left on the construction site, unused for months; some machines were dismantled for parts.
    The inspections also revealed that many projects and equipment, due to unnecessarily high standards, blindly pursuing aesthetics, and work stoppages and rework, have also caused serious waste. Many stone buildings, which could have used rough stone, were meticulously finished on all six sides; some tunnels could have been lined with rougher stone, but concrete was used throughout; temporary workers' sheds were built as sturdy and durable as permanent houses. The Engineering Bureau's hospital bought eighty universal hospital beds at once. These beds are specifically designed for patients with certain special conditions or undergoing certain surgeries, and it is said that even a large hospital only needs a few.
    What is more serious is not just these wasteful phenomena, but that some people are not even aware that they are causing waste. They have not yet discovered the main reasons for the waste, and have not recognized their own mistakes. They treat all waste as inevitable in railway construction, or attribute it to a lack of experience. But the revealed facts tell them that their argument is untenable. Because most of the waste is caused by the erroneous ideological viewpoints of some people.
    For example, some staff, especially some technical personnel, have the idea of blindly pursuing high standards: the sand needed for the project is abundant near the Qinling construction site, but they insist on using sand from the Wei River, more than twenty kilometers away. The stones used for building bridges must be finished on all six sides, for the reason that they "look good." But these bridges in high mountains and deep valleys are rarely seen by anyone except for passing trains; moreover, only one or two sides of the stones face outward, and the other sides are embedded inside, so where is the "good look" to be found? The reasons for this phenomenon are partly due to a lack of experience, partly due to a desire to show off their "creative genius" through these buildings, and partly due to using "quality" and "safety" as excuses, without performing accurate calculations to see what level of quality needs to be maintained, but believing that more is always better than less, thicker is always stronger than thinner, and that as long as there are no problems in the future, it's fine. They are even more concerned about safety and thoroughness than the "man in a box" in Gogol's novel, and are practically hiding in a safe. An engineer who designed temporary houses said, when talking about why he excessively raised the quality of temporary houses: if they are not built solidly, who will be responsible if the houses collapse and injure people? His primary consideration is the issue of personal responsibility, and he is worried about "what if"! Isn't the problem obvious?
    There are also some staff, especially a few with a longer work history, who have serious one-sided views on engineering tasks. The task they think of is just to get the tunnel through, the bridge erected, and the project completed. As for how much money it costs, they do not consider it. In order to complete the "task," they can disregard everything, add more people, use more materials, damage machinery, and not care how much the loss is. Their unshakable belief is: everything is subordinate to "completing the task," money is not a problem, what does it matter if we spend a few more?
    There are also many reworkings and accidents caused by technical errors, and these errors are mostly due to irresponsibility. An engineer, when workers asked him if the stone they were cutting met the specifications, said without thinking, "Close enough," and as a result, the specifications were wrong, and they had to rework. This same "close enough" engineer, when guiding the digging of the foundation for a bridge, had errors in four out of the five piers.
    Of course, from the facts revealed, it can also be seen that chaotic management is also an important reason for waste. For example, some construction sites are not under anyone's responsibility; the receipt, use, and storage of materials lack strict regulations; financial supervision is lax, and so on.
    Since the Sixth Engineering Bureau launched the anti-waste movement, it has achieved certain results. In particular, after mobilization reports, inspections, and discussions, the workers' awareness and enthusiasm for opposing waste have been raised, and many workers have actively risen up to fight against various wasteful phenomena and the bureaucratic style that causes waste. However, some cadres have been slow to wake up, and they have not yet felt the new demands that the state has put forward to us during the construction period. They have not yet understood the serious significance of accumulating funds for national construction.
    Therefore, in order to establish a concept of thrift among the broad masses of workers and make them pay attention to economic principles when considering any work, it is necessary to carry out a resolute and continuous struggle against various erroneous ideas. This is the urgent requirement put forward to us by the current national construction, and it is the glorious task of economic construction workers. (Excerpt from "Shaanxi Daily")

    从宝成铁路反浪费运动中看到的问题
    也辛
    宝成铁路第六工程局职工从四月份就展开了反浪费运动。从初步检查揭露的情况看，人力、材料、机械的浪费都很严重。据估算，今年第一季度完全多余的劳动力有一千多人。仅一个工程段积压的材料价值就在六十万元以上。深沙河桥打基础中由于加大水泥比例，多用水泥七百多袋。机械利用率去年只达百分之二十四，今年第一季度也只达百分之三十；而所谓被利用的机械，也有不少是放在工地，数月不用；有的机械被拆作零件使用。
    检查的情况还可看出：许多工程和设备，由于不必要地提高标准，盲目追求美观和停工返工等也造成了严重浪费。许多石头建筑，本来用粗糙的石料即可，但也打得六面平光；有些隧道可用较粗糙的石头衬砌，却一概使用混凝土；临时工棚修得像永久房屋一样坚固耐用。工程局的医院一次就买了八十张万能病床。这种病床是单为患有某几种特别病症或施行某些手术的病人准备的，据说一个大医院也只要几张就可以了。
    严重的还不仅是这些浪费现象，而是有些人造成了浪费还不自觉。他们还没有发现浪费的主要原因在哪里，没有认识到本身的错误。他们把所有浪费当作是铁路修建中不可避免的，或者说是由于经验不足。但揭发的事实告诉他们，他们这种论点是站不住脚的。因为大部分浪费的产生，是由于有些人思想观点的错误。
    例如有些工作人员特别是一部分技术人员，有盲目追求高标准的思想：工程需要的沙子，秦岭工地附近到处皆是，但却一定要用二十多公里以外的渭河沙子。砌桥用的石头，一定要六面平光，理由是“好看”。但这些在高山深沟中的桥梁，除了通行火车外是很少见人的；何况石头只有一面或两面向外，其他面都砌在里边，又向哪里去“好看”呢？产生这种现象的原因，有的是缺乏经验，有的是想让别人从这些建筑上看到他的“创作天才”，有的则以保证“质量”、“安全”为借口，不进行精确计算，看质量到底需要保持到什么程度，而是认为多了总比少了好，厚了总比薄了结实，反正将来不出岔子就行。他们比果戈理小说中“盒子里的人”还想得安全周到，简直是躲进保险柜里去了。一位设计临时房屋的工程师在谈到他为什么要过分提高临时房屋的质量时说：修得不结实，万一房子塌了压坏人，谁负责任。他考虑的首先是个人责任问题，并且担心到“万一”哩！问题不是很明显吗？
    还有些工作人员，特别是少数工作历史较长的，在对待工程任务上有严重的片面观点。他们所认为的任务就是隧道打通，桥梁架起，工程完工。至于花多少钱，他是不考虑的。为了完成“任务”，他可以不顾一切，多加人，多用料，损坏机械，不管损失多大。他们的不可动摇的信念是：一切服从“完成任务”，钱不成问题，多花几个算不得什么。
    还有许多返工、事故都是由于技术错误造成的，这些错误多半都是由于不负责任。有一位工程师，当工人问他正在打的石料合不合规格时，他不加考虑地说：“差不多”，结果规格不对，只好返工。就是这位“差不多”工程师，在指导挖一座桥的基础时，五个桥墩当中，就有四个发生错误。
    当然，从揭露的事实中也可以看到：经营管理混乱也是造成浪费的重要原因。如有的工地无人负责；材料的领取、使用、保管缺少严格的制度；财务监督松弛，等等。
    第六工程局开展反浪费运动以来，已取得了一定的成绩。特别是经过动员报告，检查讨论，提高了工人群众的反对浪费的觉悟和热情，许多工人已经积极起来同各种浪费现象和造成浪费的官僚主义作风进行斗争。但是有些干部却还迟迟未觉醒过来，他们还没有感觉到国家在建设时期向我们提出的新的要求。他们还没有懂得积累资金对国家建设的严重意义。
    因此，要在广大职工中树立起节约观点，使他们在考虑任何一项工作时都注意经济的原则，就需要同各种错误思想进行坚决的持续的斗争。这是当前国家建设向我们提出的迫切要求，是经济建设工作者的光荣任务。　（摘自“陕西日报”）
