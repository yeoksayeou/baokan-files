Happy Jinggangshan Children
Li Lianbin, Ma Zhichao

The old revolutionary base area of Jinggangshan now has six primary schools, one of which is a complete primary school named after Jinggangshan – Jinggangshan Primary School, and the other four are rural primary schools and one village primary school. Children in Jinggangshan who are of school age are now all enrolled in school. Over 95 percent of the enrolled children are the children of emancipated peasants. Boys who used to herd cattle and girls who were child brides are now carrying their schoolbags and walking into schools.

Children living in Jinggangshan are receiving care from people all over the country, and they are growing up happily.

Since its establishment in 1951, Jinggangshan Primary School has continuously received letters from primary school students all over the country, receiving a letter almost every three to five days. There are now four to five hundred letters preserved. The other five primary schools have also received many letters. The entire members of the First and Second Squads of the Fourth Detachment of the Young Pioneers of Meilin Lane Complete Primary School in the Seventh District of Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, wrote in a letter: "Recently, we had a team activity called 'Hypothetical Trip'. The instructor pointed out the location of Jinggangshan on the map. We found some introductory materials about Jinggangshan from newspapers and books, but we are not satisfied. For example, the stories of revolutionary martyrs, the Martyrs' Memorial Tower, the production situation of the families of martyrs and soldiers, the new discoveries of the exploration team... etc., all of which have made us very interested. Dear classmates, can you introduce us to some more materials?"

Many places have also sent valuable gifts to the children of various primary schools in Jinggangshan. The entire members of the First Detachment of the Young Pioneers of Gecun Primary School in Lushun City, Northeast China, sent the children of Jinggangshan Primary School local products of the Northeast: granite, quartz, peanuts, soybeans, iron ore, asbestos, white mud, small red beans, soybeans, sorghum, etc., as specimens for the children of Jinggangshan to use in their studies. The members of the First Detachment of the Young Pioneers of the Sixth Primary School in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, in order to let the children of Jinggangshan understand the nature and production process of porcelain, sent porcelain clay bricks, spoon rests, porcelain pieces, electromagnets, spoons, wine glasses, round octagonal tall teacups, small porcelain jars, etc. Jinggangshan Primary School has specially set up a specimen room to display gifts from all over the country. Jinggangshan Primary School also frequently receives guests from Beijing, Wuhan, Nanchang... etc., including international friends. Among the guests are writers, playwrights, painters, composers, poets, journalists... These guests often introduce their works and interesting stories in the writing process to the children. On an evening a few days before this year's "June 1st" Children's Day, the children of Jinggangshan Primary School heard a poet reciting his own poems and heard an international friend – Polish writer Manov – singing folk songs of the Polish mountain people at a party.

The children in Jinggangshan are working very hard in their studies, and they express that they will use excellent results to thank the care of the people all over the country. Jinggangshan Primary School now has eighty-one students, and the average score of each person is above four points. They paste the letters from children all over the country in their classrooms as a motivation to encourage themselves to study hard.

    幸福的井冈山儿童
    李连斌、马志超
    革命老根据地井冈山，现在已有六个小学了，一个是以井冈山命名的完全小学——井冈山小学，另有四个乡小学和一个村小学。井冈山上的儿童，凡是到了就学年龄的，现在都入了学。就学的儿童，百分之九十五以上的是翻身农民的子弟。过去放牛的男孩，当童养媳的女孩，现在都夹着书包，走进了学校。
    生活在井冈山上的儿童们，受到了全国人民的关怀，他们正在幸福地成长着。
    井冈山小学从一九五一年成立的时候起，就不断接到全国各地小学学生们的来信，差不多三、五天中就能收到一封信，现在保存下来的信便有四、五百封。其它五个小学也同样收到不少来信。湖南省湘潭县第七区梅林巷完全小学少年先锋队四中队第一、第二小队全体队员在一封信里这样写着：“最近我们有一次队的活动，叫做
  ‘假设旅行’，辅导员在地图上指出了井冈山的位置，我们从报纸、图书上找到了一些关于井冈山的介绍材料，可是我们还不满足，如革命烈士的故事，烈士纪念塔，烈、军属的生产情况，勘探队的新发现……等，这些都使我们很感兴趣。亲爱的同学们，你们是否可以介绍给我们一些更多的材料呢？”
    许多地方还给井冈山上各个小学的儿童寄来宝贵的礼物。东北旅大市葛村小学少年先锋队第一中队全体队员给井冈山小学的儿童寄来了东北的名产：花岗岩、石英石、花生、大豆、铁石、石绵、白泥、小红豆、大豆、高粱等等，作为井冈山儿童学习时用的标本。江西景德镇的第六小学少年先锋队第一中队的队员们，为了使井冈山的儿童了解瓷器的性质和生产过程，寄来了瓷土砖、汤匙托、瓷片、电磁、汤匙、酒杯、圆口八角形长高茶杯、小瓷坛等。井冈山小学专门设了一个标本室，陈列各地寄来的礼品。井冈山小学还经常接待来自北京、武汉、南昌……等地的客人，其中还有国际友人。客人中，有作家、戏剧家、画家、作曲家、诗人、记者……。这些客人经常向儿童们介绍自己的作品和写作过程中的有趣的故事。今年“六一”的前几天的一个晚上，井冈山小学的儿童们在一个联欢会上，便听到一个诗人朗诵着他自己所作的诗，听到了国际友人——波兰作家曼诺夫歌唱的波兰山区人民的民歌。
    井冈山上的儿童都非常努力学习，他们表示要用优良的成绩来答谢全国人民的关怀。井冈山小学现在有八十一个学生，每个人的平均成绩都在四分以上。他们把全国各地小朋友的来信，贴在自己的教室里，作为鼓励自己努力学习的动力。
