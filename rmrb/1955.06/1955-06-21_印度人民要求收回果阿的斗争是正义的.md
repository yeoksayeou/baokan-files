The Indian People's Struggle to Reclaim Goa is Just
Shi Chi
    Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference in Delhi on May 31: "Goa, geographically and otherwise, inevitably belongs to India, and therefore it must inevitably become part of the Indian Federation." This sentence summarizes the Indian people's view of the Goa issue and their desire to reclaim this Indian territory forcibly occupied by Portuguese colonialists. Goa and the other two Portuguese territories in India—Daman and Diu—are scattered along the west coast of India, with a total area of 3,983 square kilometers and a population of nearly 700,000; Goa is the largest, with an area of 3,370 square kilometers and a population of more than 600,000. Goa and Daman are contiguous with the Bombay Province, and Diu is a small island at the southern end of Kathiawar. In terms of race, culture, and economy, they are all an integral part of India.

    Historically, until the early 16th century, Goa and other places had always been Indian territory. In 1498, the Portuguese Gama led three sailing ships to Calicut and obtained residence and trade facilities from the Hindu King Samorin. Since then, Portugal has continuously sent fleets to India to attack and plunder along the Malabar Coast and the Gulf of Cambay, and forcibly occupied Diu and Goa in 1506 and 1510 respectively, establishing colonial rule there and turning Goa into the center of Portuguese colonial plunder in the East.

    For more than four hundred years, Portugal has always relied on bloody suppression to maintain its colonial rule in Goa and other places, causing endless suffering to the local residents. With an unwavering determination to fight for freedom, the people of Goa have never ceased their heroic struggle against foreign rulers. Uprisings against colonial rule continued endlessly. The largest uprising, which broke out in 1871, strongly hit the Portuguese colonial rule. Until 1912, the Portuguese authorities were still busy dealing with the peasant uprising in Goa.

    The Goa people's struggle for freedom is linked to India's independence movement. Long before the First World War, Menezes Braganza, the pioneer of the Goa national movement, declared on behalf of the Goa people that Goa would never give up its tradition of fighting for freedom and its desire for a unified and free India. In 1938, Tristão Braganza Cunha established the Goa Congress Party to lead the Goa liberation movement. In his famous pamphlet "Goa People Recovering Indian Nationality," he reflected the Goa people's strong feelings for their motherland. He also pointed out: "India's independence is incomplete as long as these foreign territories are not abolished." After India gained independence, the scale of the Goa people's movement to demand the return of Goa to the Indian Federation expanded even further. Last fall, the Goa people and Indian volunteers liberated dozens of villages in the Nagar Haveli area and Daman.

    The Indian people, who have overthrown British colonial rule and achieved national independence, are demanding the return of the Goa and other territories still occupied by foreign countries in order to maintain the integrity of their national territory and sovereignty. Throughout India, people have held many demonstrations to support the Goa people's struggle. The Indian government has been striving to resolve the issue of Goa's return to India through negotiations, demanding that Portugal recognize India's legitimate right to reclaim Goa. However, the Portuguese government has refused to negotiate since 1950, and has continued to send troops to Goa, intensifying its suppression of the Goa people's movement to return to India. Goa Congress Party leader Peter Alvares told reporters in Calcutta in May that more than 2,600 volunteers who participated in the movement to return Goa to India have been arrested by the Portuguese authorities in Goa in the past year. The Portuguese authorities' bloody incidents of shooting Goa patriots have occurred one after another. The Portuguese rulers have even blatantly threatened India with war. At the end of last November, Salazar openly threatened that "Portugal is prepared to wage war if necessary" to respond to the Indian people's actions to restore India's sovereignty over Goa. On June 8, the Portuguese Foreign Ministry issued another statement, clamoring to use "military retaliation" and "severe suppression" to deal with the Indian people's movement to reclaim Goa. The statement of the Portuguese Foreign Ministry used the colonialists' usual sophistry, describing the occupied territories of other countries as their own territory, and instead saying that the Indian people's just demand to recover their own territory was "infringement on Portuguese sovereignty," a policy of "annexation," and "endangering peace in Asia." However, this kind of colonialist propaganda that distorts the facts and confuses black and white cannot change history and facts. Goa, Diu, and Daman are Indian territories, and the Indian people's reclamation of these territories is an exercise of their own sovereignty. Portugal's occupation of these Indian territories is colonialist expansion, and its current attempt to continue to occupy these Indian territories and use force to obstruct the Indian people from reclaiming Goa is the real cause of the tense situation in the Goa issue that is unfavorable to peace in Asia.

    It should be pointed out that the reason why the Portuguese colonialists dare to be so arrogant and unreasonable and bare their fangs at the Indian people is because their colonialist policy has been supported by the United States.

    As early as May 1950, when India and Portugal were negotiating on the Goa issue, Martin, the Republican leader of the US House of Representatives, in a letter to the then US Secretary of State, requested that all forces be used to prevent India from reclaiming Goa, and attempted to erase India's sacred sovereignty over Goa with the absurd argument that Goa had "no legal relationship" with India for hundreds of years. The State Department's reply to Martin even distortedly used the words "the act of annexing Goa" to describe India's just action of reclaiming Goa. It was under the encouragement of this American colonialism that Portugal resolutely refused to continue negotiations with India on the Goa issue in August of the same year, and openly declared that Goa "is an integral part of Portugal." The signing of the US-Portugal military agreement in January 1951 further supported the Portuguese colonialists. According to this agreement, the United States, through so-called military "aid," shipped weapons and equipment to Goa in a steady stream, and these weapons were used to kill unarmed people who demanded Goa's return to India.

    At the same time, the United States used this agreement to actively turn Goa and other places into its military bases. For several years, with the assistance and supervision of the United States, Portugal has newly built and rebuilt some seaports and military airports in Goa, and built Diu into a submarine base. The Portuguese authorities also transferred a large number of East African troops to Goa. Since last year, with the rising movement of the Indian people demanding the return of Goa to India, the United States and Portugal have stepped up the construction of military projects in Goa. According to Indian newspapers, modern airports are being built near the port of Goa and Diu Island, which can accommodate any type of aircraft.

    The military deployment of the United States and Portugal in Goa not only infringes upon India's territorial sovereignty, but also poses a direct threat to India's national security.

    The people of India and Goa are responding to the colonialists' threats with more resolute actions. According to a report by the United News of India on April 15, the Goa people's movement against colonial rule has now entered a new stage, and a resistance movement has developed. In the village of Mehtil, Goans and Portuguese troops had a fierce battle. In recent months, institutions for the movement to reclaim Goa to India have been formed by members or representatives of various parties in the Indian Parliament, in Belgaum in Bombay, and in Delhi to assist and guide Indian patriots in participating in the Goa people's struggle against colonial rule. On June 18, many places in India held rallies to commemorate the anniversary of the Goa people's liberation movement, and demonstrations were also held in Goa.

    Indian National Congress President Dhebar said in a statement on May 26: "It is our responsibility to liberate every inch of land and every citizen of this country (India) from foreign rule. We are determined to do this. We will never give up until this oath is fulfilled." This statement expresses the firm will of the Indian people to reclaim Goa. The recently held Asian-African Conference condemned colonialism, declared its support for the struggle of all peoples under foreign rule for freedom and independence, and specifically expressed its sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Goa people for freedom, demanding that the Portuguese government return Goa and other territories to India through negotiations. This is a powerful support for the Indian people's struggle to reclaim Goa. There is no doubt that the just struggle of the Indian people, which is supported by honest people from all countries, will surely be victorious.

    印度人民要求收回果阿的斗争是正义的
    施迟
    印度尼赫鲁总理五月三十一日在德里举行的记者招待会上说：“果阿从地理上以及其他方面来说都必然是属于印度的，因此它无可避免地必须成为印度联邦的一部分。”这句话概括了印度人民对于果阿问题的看法和要求收回这个被葡萄牙殖民主义者强占着的印度领土的愿望。果阿和另外两个葡萄牙在印度的属地——达曼和第乌，散布在印度西部海岸，总面积三千九百八十三平方公里，人口约近七十万；其中以果阿为最大，面积三千三百七十平方公里，有人口六十余万。果阿和达曼与孟买省连成一片，第乌是卡堤阿瓦南端的一个小岛。从种族文化和经济各方面说，都是印度不可分割的一部分。
    在历史上，直到十六世纪初期，果阿等地一向是印度的领土。一四九八年，葡萄牙人伽马率领三只帆船到达卡利库特，从印度教王萨莫林取得居留和贸易的便利。自此以后，葡萄牙即不断派遣舰队到印度，沿着马拉巴海岸和康木拜湾进行攻击和劫掠，并先后在一五○六年和一五一○年强占了第乌和果阿，在那里建立了殖民统治，并把果阿变为葡萄牙在东方进行殖民掠夺的中心。
    四百多年来，葡萄牙始终依靠血腥镇压来维持它在果阿等地的殖民统治，使当地的居民遭到无限的苦难。果阿人民怀着争取自由的不可动摇的决心，从没有停止过反对外国统治者的英勇斗争。反对殖民统治的起义事件延续不绝。在一八七一年爆发的最大的一次起义，曾有力地打击了葡萄牙的殖民统治，直到一九一二年，葡萄牙当局还在忙于对付果阿的农民起义。
    果阿人民争取自由的斗争，同印度争取独立的运动是联系在一起的。远在第一次世界大战前，果阿民族运动的先驱者门尼塞斯·布拉甘查曾经代表果阿人民宣布，果阿决不放弃它的自由斗争的传统和要求一个统一和自由的印度的愿望。一九三八年，特瑞斯陶·布拉甘查·根哈建立了果阿国大党，领导果阿的解放运动。他在著名的小册子“果阿人恢复印度国籍”中，反映了果阿人民对祖国的强烈感情。他并指出：“只要这些外国属地没有取消，印度的独立就是不完全的。”印度获得独立以后，果阿人民要求果阿归还印度联邦运动的规模更加扩大。去年秋天，果阿人民和印度志愿人员在纳加尔哈维利地区和达曼解放了几十个村庄。
    已经推翻了英国殖民统治、取得了国家独立地位的印度人民，为了国家领土和主权的完整，要求收回仍被外国侵占的果阿等属地。在印度各地，人民举行了许多示威游行，支持果阿人民的斗争。印度政府一直争取用谈判方法解决果阿归还印度的问题，要求葡萄牙承认印度收回果阿的合法权利。但葡萄牙政府自一九五○年以来始终拒绝谈判，并且不断增派军队到果阿去，变本加厉地镇压果阿人民争取归还印度的运动。果阿国大党领袖彼得·阿尔瓦雷斯五月间在加尔各答对记者说：一年以来，在果阿已有二千六百名以上的争取果阿归还印度运动的志愿人员被葡萄牙当局逮捕。葡萄牙当局枪杀果阿爱国者的流血事件，层出不穷。葡萄牙统治者甚至一再露骨地对印度进行战争恫吓。去年十一月底，萨拉查曾公开威胁：“葡萄牙准备在必要时进行战争”来回答印度人民要求恢复印度对果阿的主权的行动。六月八日，葡萄牙外交部又发表声明，叫嚷要用“武力回击”和“严厉镇压”来对付印度人民收回果阿的运动。葡萄牙外交部的声明用殖民主义者惯用的强词夺理的方法，把强占的别国的属地说成是自己的领土，而把印度人民收回自己领土的正义要求反倒说成是“侵犯葡萄牙主权”，是“并吞”政策，“使亚洲的和平遭到危险”。但是，这种颠倒黑白的殖民主义宣传当然是改变不了历史和事实的。果阿、第乌和达曼是印度的领土，印度人民收回这些领土是行使自己的主权。葡萄牙侵占印度的这些领土是殖民主义的扩张，它现在还想继续霸占这些印度领土并用武力阻挠印度人民收回果阿，正是在果阿问题上造成不利于亚洲和平的紧张局势的真正原因。
    应该指出，葡萄牙殖民主义者之所以敢于对印度人民如此蛮横无理，张牙舞爪，是由于它的殖民主义政策得到了美国的支持。
    早在一九五○年五月间，正当印度和葡萄牙就果阿问题进行谈判的时候，美国众议院共和党领袖马丁在给当时美国国务卿的一封信中，要求使用一切力量来阻止印度收回果阿，并且以果阿同印度几百年“没有法律关系”这种荒谬论点，企图一笔勾销印度对果阿的神圣主权。而国务院给马丁的复信也竟然歪曲地使用了“吞并果阿之举”字样来形容印度收回果阿的正义行动。正是在美国这种殖民主义的鼓励之下，同年八月，葡萄牙就断然拒绝同印度继续谈判果阿问题，并公然宣布果阿“是葡萄牙完整的一部分”。一九五一年一月，美葡军事协定的签订，进一步支持了葡萄牙殖民主义者。根据这个协定，美国通过所谓军事“援助”把武器和装备源源运至果阿，这些武器被用来杀戮赤手空拳要求果阿归还印度的人民。
    同时，美国利用了这个协定，积极地把果阿等地变成为它的军事基地。几年以来，经过美国的援助和监督，葡萄牙在果阿新修和重建了一些海港和军用机场，把第乌建成潜水艇根据地。葡萄牙当局并调大批东非部队驻扎在果阿。去年以来，随着印度人民要求果阿归还印度的运动高涨，美国和葡萄牙更在果阿加紧修建军事工程。据印度报纸揭露，在果阿港口附近和第乌岛正在建立现代化的飞机场，可供任何类型飞机降落。
    美国和葡萄牙在果阿的军事部署，不仅侵犯了印度的领土主权，并且是对印度的国家安全的直接威胁。
    印度和果阿人民正以更坚决的行动来回答殖民主义者的威胁。据印度统一通讯社四月十五日消息：果阿人民反对殖民统治的运动目前已进入新的阶段，抵抗运动已经发展起来。在梅地尔村，果阿人和葡萄牙军队曾发生激战。近月来，在印度国会、在孟买的柏尔高姆、在德里，已由各党派议员或代表组成了争取果阿归还印度运动的机构，协助和指导印度爱国者参加果阿人民反对殖民统治的斗争。六月十八日，印度许多地方举行了集会来纪念这个果阿人民的解放运动纪念日，在果阿还举行了示威。
    印度国大党主席德巴在五月二十六日发表声明说：“使这个国家（印度）的每一寸土地和每一个公民从外国统治之下获得自由，是我们的责任。我们誓必要做到这一点。没有履行这个誓言之前，我们决不罢休。”这个声明表达了印度人民要求收回果阿的坚决意志。新近举行的亚非会议谴责了殖民主义，宣布对一切受外国统治的人民争取自由和独立的斗争的支持，并且具体地表示了对果阿人民争取自由的英勇斗争的同情，要求葡萄牙政府通过谈判把果阿等属地归还印度。这是对印度人民要求收回果阿的斗争的有力支持。毫无疑问，印度人民这一得到各国正直人民支持的正义斗争必定能够取得胜利。
