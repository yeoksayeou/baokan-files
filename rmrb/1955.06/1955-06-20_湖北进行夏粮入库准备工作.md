Hubei Prepares for Summer Grain Storage

    In order to ensure sufficient warehouses for summer grain storage, grain departments in Hubei Province have been repairing warehouses and cleaning and disinfecting them since April and May. According to incomplete statistics from the Xiaogan, Xiangyang, and Yichang regions alone, warehouses with a capacity of over 200 million jin have been prepared, more than half of which have undergone major and minor repairs and are basically leak-proof, moisture-proof, and have sturdy walls.

    In order to facilitate grain delivery by the masses and reduce casualties to people and animals, all localities have inspected and repaired safety facilities. The Xiaogan County Grain Bureau, together with the Finance Section, the District Government, and the Health Center, studied and stipulated that tea and water stations and medical stations should be set up every 10 to 20 li along the grain delivery route, and that each of the larger centralized grain storage warehouses should also have one to two tea and water/medical stations, with additional rest sheds and livestock sheds. In addition, necessary inspections were carried out on internal warehouse facilities such as stairs, springboards, and sky bridges. The Huangpi County Grain Bureau, together with the Finance Section, inspected and repaired the roads and bridges that the grain delivery masses had to pass. (Liu Shaoqing)

    湖北进行夏粮入库准备工作
    湖北省各地粮食部门为了保证夏粮入库有足够仓库，从四、五月份起，便开始了修补仓库和清洁消毒。仅据孝感、襄阳、宜昌三个专区不完全统计，已经准备了二亿多斤容量的仓库，其中一半以上经过了大小修理，基本达到上不漏、下不潮、四壁坚固。
    各地为了送粮群众在入库时的方便，减少人畜伤亡事故，都检查和修理了安全设施。孝感县粮食局同财政科、区政府、卫生所等有关部门研究规定，在送粮途中每十到二十华里设一处茶水站、医疗站，较大的集中收粮仓库每处同样设一到二处茶水、医疗站，并增添休息棚、牲口棚。此外对仓库内部的楼梯、跳板、天桥等都进行了必要的检查。黄陂县粮食局会同财政科对送粮群众必经之道路桥梁进行了检修。（刘少清）
