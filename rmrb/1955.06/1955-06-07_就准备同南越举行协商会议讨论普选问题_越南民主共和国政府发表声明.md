Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 6th: The Vice Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, held a press conference in Hanoi on the morning of June 6th. At the conference, he read out the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding preparations for holding a consultative conference with the South Vietnamese authorities to discuss the issue of free general elections. The full text of the statement is as follows:

After 300 days of the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities, the work of withdrawal and transfer of military forces has been completed, and all the territory of North Vietnam has been completely liberated.

This is a great achievement in fulfilling the Geneva Accords to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and obtain the complete independence and democracy of all Vietnam. As stated in the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, this achievement has "created the necessary prerequisites for achieving a political settlement in Vietnam in the near future" – that is, achieving the unification of Vietnam through free general elections.

Article 7 of the Geneva Conference's Final Declaration clearly stipulates:

"General elections shall be held in July 1956, under the supervision of an international commission composed of representatives of the member states of the International Supervisory and Control Commission specified in the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities. Consultations shall be held on this matter between the representative authorities of the northern and southern zones from 20 July 1955 onwards."

Article 14(a) of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities further stipulates: "Pending the general elections which will bring about the unification of Viet-Nam, the administration in each regrouping zone shall be in the hands of the party whose forces are to regroup there in accordance with the present Agreement."

Therefore, the Vietnam Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference have clearly stipulated the principle of achieving Vietnamese unification through free general elections, determined the date for holding consultative conferences and the date for holding general elections, and clearly stipulated each party's responsibilities in this matter.

Up to now, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has faithfully fulfilled the Geneva Accords in the withdrawal and transfer of military forces and other matters. From now on, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is determined to continue to faithfully fulfill the Geneva Accords in organizing free general elections to achieve Vietnamese unification and in other matters. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announces that it is prepared to hold consultative conferences with the representative authorities of South Vietnam from July 20, 1955, to discuss the organization of free general elections throughout Vietnam in July 1956.

The French government has announced that it is determined to fulfill the Geneva Accords. On May 17th of this year, when the withdrawal and transfer of military forces were completed, the representatives of the Command of the Forces of the French Union and the representatives of the High Command of the Vietnam People's Army solemnly issued the following joint statement:

"Both sides are determined to continue to bear the responsibilities stipulated in the Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, and once again declare their willingness to respect and thoroughly implement the clauses and provisions of these documents in order to consolidate peace and achieve the unification of Vietnam through general elections."

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam welcomes and takes note of this statement.

Faithfully implementing the Geneva Accords and achieving the unification of Vietnam through free general elections is the deep aspiration and firm determination of the Vietnamese people, all social strata in North and South Vietnam, all patriots, and political figures. This is also the desire of the French people and all peace-loving people in the world. The people of the world will warmly support the realization of Vietnamese unification, because this will consolidate peace in Vietnam and will also help consolidate peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

From the point of view of history, geography, culture, language, customs and habits, Vietnam and the Vietnamese nation constitute a single whole. After many centuries of work and struggle, the Vietnamese people have established the unity of their country. The August Revolution (1945), which marked the end of a stage in the nearly century-long anti-colonial struggle, established a unified, independent and democratic republic. In the past eight or nine years, the Vietnamese people have waged a very heroic struggle to defend their unity, independence, and democracy, thereby achieving brilliant victories at Dien Bien Phu and at the Geneva Conference. The participating countries of the Geneva Conference confirmed: "The military demarcation line is provisional and should not in any way be interpreted as constituting a political or territorial boundary," and "guarantee the respect for the sovereignty, the independence, the unity and the territorial integrity of Cambodia, Laos and Viet-Nam, refraining from any interference in their internal affairs."

Achieving the unification of their country through free general elections held in accordance with the Geneva Accords is the sacred national right of the Vietnamese people. All the Vietnamese people are determined to unite closely and wage a resolute struggle to realize this sacred right.

Vietnam is a whole. The Vietnamese nation is a whole. No force can separate them. Whoever attempts to split Vietnam is an enemy of the Vietnamese people and will inevitably be defeated. All Vietnamese who support peace, unity, independence, and democracy, regardless of their social class, political affiliation, or religious belief, should unite in the struggle to achieve common goals, and they will surely achieve victory.

In the struggle for unification, the Vietnamese people constantly maintain a high degree of vigilance, constantly guarding against any conspiracy by the American imperialists aimed at splitting Vietnam. They are determined to unite and fight against this conspiracy and smash this conspiracy.

With the warm approval and support of the people of the world, the Vietnamese people, united like a rock and determined to fight, will certainly guarantee the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords and achieve the unification of Vietnam through free general elections.

    就准备同南越举行协商会议讨论普选问题
    越南民主共和国政府发表声明
    新华社河内六日讯　越南民主共和国副总理范文同六日上午在河内举行记者招待会，他在会上宣读了越南民主共和国政府关于准备同南越当局举行协商会议以讨论自由普选问题的声明。声明全文如下：
    在停止敌对行动协定执行三百天以后，军事部队的撤退和转移工作已经完成，北越的全部领土已经完全解放。
    这在履行日内瓦协定以巩固和平、实现统一和获得全越南的完全独立和民主方面，是一个巨大的成就。正像日内瓦会议最后宣言中所说的，这种成就已经“造成在最近时期内实现越南政治解决的必要前提”——即用自由普选的办法实现越南的统一。
    日内瓦会议最后宣言第七条规定得十分清楚：
    “将在一九五六年七月内，在停止敌对行动协定中所规定的国际监督和监察委员会成员国代表所组成的国际委员会的监督下举行普选。自一九五五年七月二十日起，双方地区有代表性的负责当局，应就此项问题进行协商。”
    停止敌对行动协定第十四条甲款还规定：“在实现越南统一的普选前，各集结区内的行政由依照停止敌对行动协定应集结部队于该区的一方负责管辖。”
    因此，越南停止敌对行动协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言已经清楚地规定了通过自由普选来实现越南统一的原则，已经确定了举行协商会议的日期和举行普选的日期，并且还清楚地规定了每方在这个问题上的责任。
    到目前为止，在撤退和转移军事部队以及在其他问题上，越南民主共和国政府忠实地履行了日内瓦协定。从现在起，在组织自由普选以便实现越南统一以及在其他问题上，越南民主共和国政府决心继续忠实地履行日内瓦协定。越南民主共和国政府宣布它准备从一九五五年七月二十日起同南越有代表性的负责当局举行协商会议，讨论在一九五六年七月在越南全国举行自由普选的组织问题。
    法国政府已经宣布它决心履行日内瓦协定。今年五月十七日，在军事部队的撤退和转移工作完成的时候，法兰西联邦部队总司令部的代表和越南人民军总司令部的代表郑重地发表了如下的联合声明：
    “双方决心继续担负它们彻底履行日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言中所规定的责任，并且再一次声明，它们愿意尊重和彻底执行这些文件的条款和规定，以便巩固和平并且通过普选来实现越南的统一。”
    越南民主共和国政府欢迎并且注意到了这项声明。
    忠实履行日内瓦协定通过自由普选来实现越南的统一，是越南人民、北越和南越的各社会阶层、一切爱国者和政界人士的深切愿望和坚强决心。这也是法国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的愿望。全世界人民将热烈支持越南实现统一，因为这将巩固越南的和平，并且还将有助于巩固东南亚以及全世界的和平。
    从历史、地理、文化、语言风俗和习惯各点来看，越南和越南民族构成了一个单一的整体。经过许多世纪的工作和斗争，越南人民已经建立了他们国家的统一。标志着将近一世纪的反殖民统治斗争的一个阶段的结束的八月革命（一九四五年），建立起了一个统一、独立和民主的共和国。越南人民在过去八、九年中就是为了保卫他们的统一、独立和民主而进行了非常英勇的斗争，因而在奠边府和在日内瓦会议上取得了辉煌的胜利。日内瓦会议的与会国确认：“军事分界线无论如何不能被解释为政治的或领土的边界”，“保证尊重柬埔寨、老挝和越南的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，并对其内政不予任何干涉”。
    通过根据日内瓦协定举行的自由普选来实现他们国家的统一是越南人民的神圣的民族权利。全体越南人民决心紧密地团结起来，为实现这种神圣的权利而进行坚决的斗争。
    越南是一个整体。越南民族是一个整体。没有任何力量能把他们分开。谁企图分裂越南谁就是越南人民的敌人，并且必将遭到失败。凡是拥护和平、统一、独立和民主的越南人，不论他们的社会阶层、政治派别或宗教信仰如何，应该团结在争取共同目标的斗争中，他们一定会取得胜利。
    在争取统一的斗争中，越南人民经常保持高度的警惕，经常防备着目的在于分裂越南的美帝国主义者的任何阴谋。他们决心团结起来同这种阴谋进行斗争，粉碎这种阴谋。
    在全世界人民的热烈赞同和支持下，像磐石般团结在一起和决心斗争的越南人民，一定会保证严格履行日内瓦协定，并且通过自由普选而获得越南的统一。
