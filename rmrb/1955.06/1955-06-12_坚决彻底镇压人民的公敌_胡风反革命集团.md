    Resolutely and Thoroughly Suppress the Public Enemy of the People – The Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
    Peng Zemin
    The materials revealed in the "People's Daily" have clearly proven that the Hu Feng clique is a group of wolves in sheep's clothing, the public enemy of all the Chinese people.
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has long been a loyal running dog of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. They put on the cloak of Marxism, disguised themselves as revolutionaries, and used various methods to infiltrate our revolutionary camp to carry out sabotage activities. Many of the key members of this clique were originally Kuomintang secret agents and revolutionary traitors. In the past, they wholeheartedly supported and actively participated in the anti-people civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek. After liberation, they intensified their frenzied attacks on the Chinese Communist Party, the people, and the revolution. They undermined the literary and artistic policies and cultural policies led by the Chinese Communist Party, hated the people's democratic regime and everything in the new society, and dreamed of the failure of the Chinese people's cause and the restoration of Chiang's reactionary bloody rule. For these heinous counter-revolutionary elements, we should resolutely and mercilessly cleanse them from the revolutionary ranks. I, representing the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, demand that Hu Feng's qualification as a representative of the National People's Congress be immediately revoked and that he be brought to justice.
    The Hu Feng clique incident is a major counter-revolutionary case. With the increasing consolidation and strengthening of our people's democratic regime and the rapid advancement of the country's socialist construction, the enemies at home and abroad will never be reconciled. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident is a concrete example of the conspiracies and sabotage carried out by enemies at home and abroad against us. In order to sabotage our revolutionary cause, the enemy will certainly collude with and dispatch other counter-revolutionary elements to hide in our revolutionary ranks. Through the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we must also resolutely and ruthlessly struggle against other hidden counter-revolutionary elements and eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements. Only in this way can we consolidate the fruits of the people's revolution and smoothly complete our country's socialist construction.
    The exposure of the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a major victory for the Chinese Communist Party and the people of the whole country. We must learn from this incident and heighten our vigilance. We must recognize that if Hu Feng elements can infiltrate such a tight organization as the Chinese Communist Party to carry out sabotage, they will be even more likely to infiltrate our democratic parties. The revealed materials prove that Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements often choose those who have ideological errors or low political vigilance as their targets, enticing and luring them to fall into their traps. Every member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party should be more vigilant, strictly distinguish between the enemy and ourselves through the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and at the same time strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, intensify ideological transformation, closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, further strengthen unity, and strive to the end for the country's socialist construction.

    坚决彻底镇压人民的公敌——胡风反革命集团
    彭泽民
    “人民日报”所揭发的材料，已经清楚地证明胡风集团是一群披着羊皮的豺狼，是全中国人民的公敌。
    胡风反革命集团很早以来就是蒋介石反动派的忠实走狗，他们披上马克思主义的外衣，伪装革命，用各种各样的方式打到我们革命阵营里来进行破坏活动。这个集团中的许多骨干分子原来都是一些国民党特务分子和革命叛徒，过去他们曾经衷心拥护和积极参加蒋介石所发动的反人民的内战，解放后更变本加厉地对中国共产党、对人民、对革命进行猖狂的进攻。他们破坏中国共产党所领导的文艺方针和文化政策，仇恨人民民主政权和新社会中的一切，他们梦想中国人民事业归于失败而使蒋贼的反动血腥统治得到复辟。对于这些罪大恶极的反革命分子，我们应该坚决地毫不容情地将他们从革命阵营中清洗出去。我代表中国农工民主党要求立即撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并予以法办。
    胡风集团的事件是一件重大的反革命案件，随着我国人民民主政权的日益巩固壮大和国家的社会主义建设事业的突飞猛进，国内外的敌人是绝对不会甘心的，胡风反革命集团这个事件，正是国内外敌人对我们进行阴谋破坏的一个具体事实。敌人为了破坏我们的革命事业，一定还会勾结和派遣其他的反革命分子暗藏在我们革命队伍里。通过对胡风反革命集团的斗争，同样地我们也要坚决地和其他暗藏的反革命分子进行无情的斗争，把一切反革命分子清除出去。这样才能巩固人民革命的胜利果实，才能顺利地完成我们国家的社会主义建设事业。
    胡风反革命集团罪行的揭露，是中国共产党和全国人民的一项重大的胜利，我们一定要从这一事件中吸取教训，提高警惕。我们必须认识到，胡风分子能够混进中国共产党这样严密的组织中进行破坏，他们就更会混到我们民主党派内部来。已经揭露的材料证明，胡风反革命分子时常选择那些思想犯有错误或政治警惕性不高的人作为对象，进行引诱拉拢，使这些人坠入他们的圈套。中国农工民主党的每个成员更应该提高警惕性，通过对胡风反革命集团的斗争，严格划清敌我界限，同时更应该加强对马克思列宁主义的学习，加紧思想改造，紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，进一步加强团结，为国家的社会主义建设事业而奋斗到底。
