Criticizing Hu Shih's "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy" from a Pragmatic Viewpoint and Methodology
Feng Youlan Zhu Bokun

The reactionary viewpoints disseminated by Hu Shih in his "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy" are nothing but the American imperialism's pragmatic subjective idealism and vulgar evolutionism. The method he used in this book is built on this extremely decadent worldview and is its concrete application. This book is, in effect, a pragmatic textbook.

The views disseminated by Hu Shih in the "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy" regarding philosophy and the history of philosophy, the explanation of the emergence and development of ancient Chinese philosophical thought, and the evaluation of ancient philosophical thought are all manifestations and applications of this extremely reactionary subjective idealism and vulgar evolutionism. We will demonstrate this in four points below.

	I. Hu Shih distorts the object of philosophical history by using pragmatic philosophical views

Pragmatism's views on philosophy and the history of philosophy are fundamentally opposed to Marxism's views on philosophy and the history of philosophy. In his "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy," Hu Shih first defined philosophy as: "Any study of essential problems of life, thinking from the root, seeking a fundamental solution. This kind of learning is called philosophy." This is derived from Dewey's fallacy of distorting the nature of philosophy. Dewey said: "If philosophy stops dealing with those 'philosophers' problems,' if philosophy becomes a philosophical method for solving 'human problems,' then the day of philosophy's restoration will come." (Hu Shih, "Fifty Years of World Philosophy")

The so-called "human problems" or "essential problems of life" are what they call "difficult situations" and "difficulties" encountered in the living environment. In their view, philosophy is a tool for solving these "difficulties" or "problems," that is, a "method of thinking" for "coping with the environment."

Pragmatism's vulgar evolutionism believes that the "coping with the environment" of animals such as "many maggots" and "a bee," and the problem of how a person lost in the woods solves the problem of how to get out of the woods, and the problem of how scientist Galileo proves air pressure, are all the same kind of thing, all "coping with the environment," only "differing in degree." The so-called truth is not a correct "reflection" of the objective world and its laws, but merely a tool for people to "cope with the environment," just like the "coping with the environment" of "many maggots" and "a bee."

Pragmatism attempts to use this absurd theory to deny the fundamental problem of philosophy, the opposition and struggle between materialism and idealism, two worldviews. According to its argument, since philosophy is mainly a method for solving "life problems," the issue of the opposition and struggle between materialism and idealism is secondary and can be "left unresolved." Pragmatism attempts to conceal the essence of its own subjective idealist worldview with such a technique in order to confront scientific materialism.

Marxism believes that there is no "life problem" that is detached from social class issues. The solution to any "life problem" reflects a class's social viewpoint and cannot be separated from the foundation of their worldview. Philosophy is a worldview, the sum of a particular class's views and concepts about the entire world and its laws. No matter which class's philosophy it is, it will ultimately come down to the basic question of worldview—the relationship between thinking and being. The answer to this question basically cannot escape the two opposing camps of materialism and idealism. Hu Shih's "leaving it unresolved" is precisely giving this question a subjective idealist answer. He attempts to conceal the class nature of philosophy with abstract "life problems." This is precisely a manifestation of the class nature of pragmatism serving the big bourgeoisie.

What is the history of philosophy? Hu Shih said: "These various essential problems of life, since ancient times, have been studied by many philosophers. Often, after a problem arises, each person has their own views, each person has their own solutions... If someone records all the various research methods and various solutions to various philosophical problems, according to the order of the times and the system of schools, then it becomes the history of philosophy."

Philosophy is the philosophy of a certain class. Philosophers serve a specific class. The reason why various philosophical schools have different or even contradictory views is because the class interests they reflect are different, even contradictory. If this main fact is concealed, in the history of philosophy, only "each person has their own views, each person has their own solutions" will remain. In this way, the history of philosophy becomes an accidental accumulation of philosophers' personal subjective opinions and personal "methods" of "coping with the environment." According to Hu Shih, the task of philosophical historians is merely to "record" these accidental events "one by one." Although it also "follows the order of the times and the system of schools," there is no law, and the history of philosophy is still a "muddled mess." As we point out below, even in this respect, Hu Shih still arranges things arbitrarily according to his subjective idealist method.

Hu Shih reduces the content of philosophy to method because, from a pragmatic point of view, thought is just a tool, a method, for solving difficulties. Pragmatism itself claims to be a method. According to Hu Shih, ancient Chinese thought became a "tool" for "coping with the environment," and ancient Chinese philosophers became "instrumentalists" for "dealing with human problems."

In Hu Shih's "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy," the "methods" of each school are arranged equally. They are all "hypotheses," they are all "methods," and they do not reflect the objective world and its laws. This obliterates the objective truth reflected to a certain extent in ancient Chinese philosophical thought, denies the fundamental problem in the history of ancient Chinese philosophy—the struggle between materialism and idealism worldviews—and distorts the tradition of ancient materialism worldviews.

Marxism believes that a scientific history of philosophy is the history of the struggle between the materialist worldview, which constantly represents the interests of the advanced class, and the idealist worldview, which constantly represents the interests of the reactionary class, that is, the history of the emergence and development of the materialist worldview and its laws. This is the universal law of the development of the history of philosophy. The development of Chinese philosophical thought also follows this universal law. Revealing this law is the task of Chinese philosophical historians.

	II. Hu Shih distorts the causes of ancient thought by using pragmatic subjective idealism

Pragmatism's explanation of the causes of the emergence of ideas and doctrines is fundamentally opposed to the historical materialism's scientific principle of "social being determines social consciousness." Pragmatism does not acknowledge that ideas and doctrines are reflections of social existence in people's minds, but believes that ideas and doctrines are tools for individuals to cope with events and solve difficulties in response to the stimulation of the living environment, and are things fabricated by individuals according to their subjective desires. According to pragmatism, satisfying personal subjective desires and interests is the fundamental reason for the generation of ideas and doctrines. Hu Shih established his view of history and "historical method" on this subjective idealist basis.

In the "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy," he also said that he wanted to "seek the cause." He said: "The purpose of the history of philosophy is not only to point out the clues of the evolution and change of philosophical thought, but also to find out the reasons for these evolutions and changes." "These reasons are roughly three: (A) Differences in individual talent and nature; (B) Differences in the times in which they are situated; (C) Differences in the ideological and academic influences they receive." Although these reasons are commonly stated by general bourgeois historians of philosophy, Hu Shih's statement also has its pragmatic content and is a concrete application of the pragmatic subjective idealist view of history and method.

Pragmatism starts from the individual: according to pragmatism, life is individual life; experience is individual experience; the environment is the individual's environment; adaptation is the individual's adaptation. So-called success or failure, satisfaction or dissatisfaction, are all individual. What he calls "talent and nature" is actually the individual's ability to cope with the environment, which is what pragmatism calls "creative wisdom."

In the "Theories of the Philosophers Not Originating from Royal Officials," Hu Shih said: "The rise of a school is nothing but responding to the times. When the times change and things are different, the learning that used to respond to the world becomes useless writing." In the "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy," it is also said that the ideas of ancient schools all originated from "reactions to various situations." The so-called "situation" is the "environment" in which an individual is situated. He wants to "cope with the environment," and in the process of "coping with the environment," he encounters "difficulties" and "difficult situations," and he has to find ways to solve them, and this is thought. This is also the so-called "reaction." "Reaction" is the individual's response to the stimulation of the environment, thereby "coping with the environment."

It must be pointed out that the "situation" mentioned by Hu Shih is only the superficial phenomenon in society, and only plays a stimulating role in the emergence of ancient ideas and doctrines. What plays a decisive role is the class struggle in society. This is what Hu Shih wants to conceal.

As Hu Shih described it, the "situation" in the "Age of Poets" (from the eighth century BC to the seventh century BC) was nothing more than "politics being so dark, society being so chaotic, the disparity between the rich and the poor being so great, and the people's livelihood being so painful. With this kind of situation, various ideological reactions will naturally arise." However, there is only "this kind" of "situation," but there are "various" ideological reactions. Speaking of the era of Lao Tzu and Confucius, he said: "Since the situation in this era is so 'lawless,' there will naturally be many 'concerned people' who will have various reactions to this situation." According to him, there are three types of "reactions": "First, the extreme destruction faction" (Lao Tzu); "Second, the extreme world-weary faction"; "Third, the active salvation faction" (Confucius). The "situation" is the same, but the "trends of thought" that arise can be contradictory. According to him, that is mainly due to differences in "individual talent and nature."

Hu Shih declared: "The situation creates trends of thought, and trends of thought create the situation." On the surface, it seems that he treats "the situation" and "trends of thought" equally. But according to him, thought is a tool for solving difficulties that arises in response to the stimulation of the environment. "The situation" can only cause "trends of thought," but cannot determine the content of "trends of thought"; however, "the situation" is influenced by "trends of thought" and "there will definitely be great changes." That is to say, the "effect" of trends of thought can determine the trend of "the situation." This is the essence of his subjective idealist view of history.

The "different ideological and academic influences received" by the philosophers mentioned by Hu Shih also has its pragmatic content. Pragmatism believes that individuals need to seek various hints and solutions from the ideological consciousness that stores past "experience" in order to cope with the environment and solve difficult problems. Therefore, Hu Shih believes that the various viewpoints put forward by ancient philosophers also originate from previous thoughts, or are "reactions" generated by the stimulation of previous thoughts. According to him, the emergence of Mohist thought is due to the reaction against Confucian thought. "Because Confucianism does not believe in ghosts, Mo Tzu advocated the 'theory of illuminating ghosts.' Because Confucianism values thick burials and long funerals, Mo Tzu advocated the 'theory of frugal burials.' Because Confucianism values rituals and music, Mo Tzu advocated the 'theory of anti-music.' Because Confucianism believes in fate, Mo Tzu advocated the 'theory of anti-fate.'" These are all seeking the origin of ideological consciousness from ideological consciousness itself.

Hu Shih also believes that the reason why certain schools of thought in ancient times gained a dominant position, and the reason why other schools of thought gradually declined, is only due to the result of mutual attacks by various thoughts. According to him, ancient Chinese philosophy was "interrupted." "What is the reason for this? According to my humble opinion, there are roughly four true reasons: (1) Skepticism's logic. (2) Narrow utilitarianism. (3) Despotism's unification of thought. (4) The superstition of the alchemist faction." That is to say, thought itself can be the reason for determining the development and decline of thought.

This fully exposes the essence of Hu Shih's idealist view of history.

Marxism believes that the fundamental reasons for the emergence and development of ancient philosophical thought must be sought in the material living conditions of ancient society—the changes in the mode of production. The development of production in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods caused tremendous changes in the social and economic system, which led to the complication and deepening of class struggles. This is the real reason for the emergence of various schools of thought in ancient times. The various philosophical schools that appeared in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods represented the interests of various different classes. The new viewpoints and doctrines put forward reflected the new requirements of social and economic development at that time. The reason why the thoughts of Confucius, Lao Tzu, and Mo Tzu mentioned above are different is precisely because their thoughts served different classes. The reason why certain philosophical schools were able to gradually gain a dominant position at that time was that they were combined with the interests of the advanced classes and advanced social groups that gradually gained a dominant position at that time. The reason why certain philosophical schools gradually declined was that the class forces they represented gradually declined or weakened.

	III. Hu Shih arbitrarily smears the development trend of ancient thought by using vulgar evolutionism

The "historical attitude" and the so-called method of "understanding change" advocated by Hu Shih are concrete applications of the views of pragmatic vulgar evolutionism.

He said: "All changes are from subtle to obvious, from simple to complex." In his view, "from subtle to obvious" and "from simple to complex" are the same thing. Why "from simple to complex"? According to him, it is because the original subtle things later became obvious. He borrowed a few words from Zhuangzi's book to expound this "theory of evolution."

Zhuangzi's "Parables" chapter has a sentence that says: "All things are seeds, transformed by different forms"; the "Supreme Happiness" chapter says: "Seeds have different natures." This originally meant that there are many kinds of things, but they can be transformed into each other. "Seeds have different natures" means that there are many kinds of things. Zhuangzi listed many kinds of things in the following text. Ancient people believed that one thing could be transformed into another, such as "rotten grass turning into fireflies." This is what Zhuangzi called "transformation of things," which is an unfounded speculation that does not conform to the facts, and does not contain the meaning of evolution from low to high. This has nothing in common with the scientific theory of evolution. However, Hu Shih forcibly associated it with the theory of biological evolution. He interpreted the word "natures" as the meaning of "subtle," and he said that the meaning of these words of Zhuangzi is "to say that biological evolution all starts from a kind of extremely subtle seed, and then gradually evolves, 'transformed by different forms,' from the lowest microorganisms, step by step, to the highest human beings. Because biological evolution is like this, it can be seen that those seeds contain the 'possibility' of all things (also known as potential—original note), so they can gradually change from this 'possibility' to the 'actuality' of various kinds of things (also known as manifest—original note). It can also be seen that the previous stage of biological evolution contains the 'possibility' of the next stage." According to his statement, the "possibility of all things" is already contained in the original "extremely subtle seeds." The change of the species of organisms is nothing more than a process of "gradually" changing from this "possibility" to the "actuality" of various kinds of things. Changing from the original "possibility" to "actuality" is "from subtle to obvious." The increase in the types of organisms and the progress of physique is "from simple to complex." Hu Shih believes that the two are the same thing. This is a metaphysical view that denies the emergence of new qualitative states in nature and actually denies evolution.

Hu Shih believes that things in human society also "evolve" in this way. There is no fundamentally completely new ideological content in the change of human thought and consciousness. He said: "When a person encounters difficulties, he will naturally seek a way to cope with them; at this time, in his past experience and knowledge, the needed signals will emerge with some hints," According to him, the "way to cope" must be "sought" in these hints. Therefore, there can be no fundamentally completely new ideas.

His theory of evolution is applied to the history of philosophy, and there are no fundamentally completely new ideas in the history of philosophy. According to him, a philosopher's thought can only "seek" methods to solve problems in "previous academic thought." According to his description in the "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy," the process of ancient Chinese thought development is also a process of "from subtle to obvious," "from simple to complex," gradually changing from the initial "possibility" to "actuality." The development of ancient thought is only a quantitative increase or decrease, without qualitative changes, but only a supplement, improvement and synthesis of old ideas. (For example, he believes that the viewpoints of important schools in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods all had "seeds" in the "Book of Songs," and the subsequent development was only the "subtle to obvious" of these "seeds," and the development of Chinese thought after the Qin and Han dynasties was only a "compromise mixture" of the previous ones.)

Hu Shih also believes that the significant changes in the thought of a school and an era are not due to internal reasons, but due to the influence of foreign ideas. He believes that the new viewpoints put forward by many schools in ancient times are not due to the new requirements of the classes they represent, but only the result of mutual influence among the schools. After the Qin and Han dynasties, the philosophical thought development in the middle and late ancient times was all influenced by the input of Indian Buddhism. It seems that without the input of Indian Buddhism, there would be no "new philosophy" after the Qin and Han dynasties. He also believes that the future "new philosophy" of China must rely on the input of Western bourgeois philosophy, otherwise Chinese philosophy will not have new development. These viewpoints not only expose the toxins of the bourgeois idealist view of history and cosmopolitanism, but also the anti-scientific fallacy led out of the development view of vulgar evolutionism. Naturally, Hu Shih's carrying this viewpoint has obliterated the truth of Chinese philosophy development, and the internal social economic material foundation that Chinese philosophy development relies on.

The "understanding change" advertised by Hu Shih in the "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy" is not pursuing the objective law of philosophy and thought development, but only seeking the relationship of transmission and acceptance between the past and the future of thought and the order of the past and the future of the evolution of ancient thought. Even in this aspect, Hu Shih did not determine the order of the past and the future of thought development based on fully possessing historical data and scientifically identifying historical data, but arbitrarily arranged historical data according to the viewpoint of vulgar evolutionism, and subjectively created clues for thought development. He proclaimed that the history of ancient Chinese thought development is only "step by step, gradually progressive history of thought development," denying the interruption and qualitative changes of progress in the process of thought development, which is the actual content of what he said "inheriting in one line." Based on this viewpoint of vulgar evolutionism, Hu Shih absurdly believed that the viewpoint expressed in the book "Lao Tzu" should be the continuation of the thought in the "Book of Songs" "Cutting Sandalwood" chapter, and forcibly imposed the worldview of the Yi Zhuan in the late Warring States period on Confucius in the Spring and Autumn period, and forcibly said that the "Yang Zhu Chapter" in the Wei and Jin dynasties was thought before Zhuangzi, to illustrate the "gradually progressive" clue of ancient thought that he fabricated himself. Not only that, but he also arbitrarily relied on the so-called "clues of the change of doctrine" to determine the era of some works. Believing that there should be a thing that inherits the past and heralds the future between some different viewpoints, which conforms to the "gradual" natural order. Based on this method, he came to the conclusion that works such as "The Great Learning" and "The Doctrine of the Mean" should appear before Mencius and Xunzi. The "historical attitude" boasted by Hu Shih is actually anti-historical.

Marxism believes that the history of the development of human ideology, like the history of natural and social development, is governed by the ordinary laws of dialectical development. Accompanying each historical stage of Chinese society development, the history of Chinese thought development has qualitative changes, and when new economic factors and new class forces appear within Chinese society, a corresponding new ideology will inevitably appear, and this new ideology develops through the fierce struggle with the ideology representing the old social forces. The contradiction and struggle between new and old thoughts is the law of Chinese thought development. The development of the various schools of thought that appeared in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods was carried out under the domination of this law.

Marxism believes that the inheritance and connection in the development of ideology is by no means a simple "ideological blood relationship," but that ideologists representing certain class interests inherit or discard the ideological materials created by their predecessors according to the economic requirements of their class. Economic and class interests themselves determine the direction of changes in thoughts and viewpoints. Although some schools of thought in ancient China inherited some viewpoints from their predecessors in form, they represented different class interests, and therefore obtained new content and new forms that were essentially different from their predecessors. Xunzi, the representative of the later Confucian school, and the Legalist thought that appeared in the Warring States period established their own systems under the domination of this law.

	IV. Hu Shih arbitrarily judges the value of ancient thought and doctrines by using the pragmatic "theory of effect"

The pragmatic standard for evaluating ideas and doctrines is fundamentally opposed to the scientific viewpoints of Marxism's theory of reflection and historicism. The pragmatic "theory of effect" is the basis for Hu Shih to evaluate ancient ideas and doctrines. Pragmatism does not recognize objective truth. It believes that "truth" is only a tool used to satisfy personal desires and "cope with the environment." From this, it also believes that the criterion for evaluating an idea or doctrine is to see whether it can produce a "beneficial effect" for the individual.

Hu Shih said: "These effects can probably be divided into three types: (A) To see what kind of influence a school of thought has on the thought of the same period and later thought. (B) To see what kind of influence a school of thought has on customs and politics. (C) To see what kind of personality can be created by the result of a school of thought." These three types of "effects" he mentioned are consistent with the three causes he mentioned when talking about "seeking the cause."

Hu Shih said that pragmatism is a philosophical method, and this method has a so-called "historical method," that is, the "grandfather and grandson method." This method "never regards a system or doctrine as an isolated thing, but always regards him as a middle section: one end is the reason for his occurrence, and the other end is the effect he produces; above him is his grandfather, and below him are his grandchildren. If you catch these two ends, he can no longer escape." His "historical method" is actually the expression of pragmatism's instrumentalism. As mentioned above, he believes that a doctrine has three grandfathers and three grandchildren.

Hu Shih's "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy" is written according to this method. He flaunts "understanding change" and "seeking the cause" to grasp the "top" of a doctrine, and he flaunts "criticism" to grasp its "bottom." The content of this method he used is to use subjective idealism and vulgar evolutionism to grasp the "top" of a doctrine, and to use the pragmatic "theory of effect" to grasp the "bottom" of a doctrine. This is the reactionary essence of the method he used.

From the pragmatic "theory of effect" point of view, "the value of the...effects generated by each school of thought is the value of that kind of doctrine." That is to say, a doctrine does not have its own value, it is only a tool. Its value depends on whether it is useful or not. Hu Shih is precisely using this subjective idealist viewpoint to "criticize" the value of all ancient doctrines.

Hu Shih's use of this pragmatic "theory of effect" to "criticize" the doctrines in the history of philosophy will inevitably obliterate the meaning that a doctrine should have in history.

Hu Shih said: "The criticism I am talking about is not to criticize the rights and wrongs, gains and losses of the ancients with the eyes of the person who is doing the history of philosophy. That kind of 'subjective' criticism is not of great use. What is now said is 'objective' criticism." But applying pragmatism's theory of truth to the history of philosophy, all criticisms must be "subjective" criticisms, that is, using his own eyes to criticize the rights and wrongs, gains and losses of the ancients. Hu Shih's criticisms of the major schools in the history of philosophy are often arbitrarily fabricated and changed at any time according to the needs of his master—American imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie.

During the May Fourth Movement, the interests of American imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie were basically to maintain the rule of Chinese feudalism, and to make some degree of reform to suit the needs of imperialism. At this time, Hu Shih also described Confucius as an "active salvation faction" who was "determined to political reform" in order to promote his reactionary reformism. On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, in his published "Speaking of Confucianism," he described Confucius as the great religious leader of the remnants of the vanquished nation according to the requirements of imperialism, in order to promote Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance. Now in Taiwan, he describes Confucius as a liberal, and seeks theoretical basis for the "free China" manufactured by American imperialism.

During the May Fourth Movement, in order to disguise progress and distort the revolution, Hu Shih described Lao Tzu as a "revolutionary" with "a revolutionary political philosophy." During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, he successively published reactionary articles such as "From Rural Relief to Non-Interventionist Politics" (Independent Review, issue 49) and "Re-discussing Non-Interventionist Politics" (Independent Review, issue 89), using Lao Tzu's thought of "non-intervention" to demand that the Kuomintang reactionary government stop all construction and do its best to maintain "social order," that is, to use all its strength to fight the Communist Party. In "Speaking of Confucianism," in order to prepare for the subjugation of the country, he also said that Lao Tzu was not a "revolutionary," nor did he have any "revolutionary political philosophy," but only advocated the Judo of the "remnants of the vanquished nation." Now in Taiwan, in order to slander our government, he greatly praises Lao Tzu's "non-interventionist" thought, saying that it is anarchism against "totalitarianism."

Mo Tzu is the one he has been vigorously praising in the "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy" because he can use to associate certain viewpoints of Mo Tzu to promote pragmatism. Later, during the Second Domestic Revolution, in his "History of Medieval Philosophy," he ridiculed Mo Tzu's altruism of "sacrificing oneself to benefit the world" as a "view of life that violates human nature." Now in Taiwan, he also says that Mo Tzu is an extremely "reactionary" figure, because he advocates "advocating the same," and "advocating the same" is "totalitarian politics," thereby slandering our people's democratic dictatorship.

In the dying era of imperialism, it believes that the standards of truth and falsehood, right and wrong, can be changed at any time according to its "convenience." Treaties signed yesterday can be invalidated today. Declarations issued today can be disregarded tomorrow. Hu Shih's criticisms of various doctrines in the history of philosophy are also manifestations of this kind of thought.

This is the reactionary essence of Hu Shih's advertised "objective criticism." This extremely decadent and anti-rational subjective idealist viewpoint is his "historical attitude" towards the cultural heritage of the motherland.

Marxism's theory of reflection believes that the inherent value of a doctrine lies in its correct reflection of objective reality to a certain extent. If it can be useful to human society, it is precisely because it reflects objective laws to a certain extent. Lenin said: "The reason why Marxist doctrine is omnipotent is because it is correct." The value of Marxist theory lies in its correct reflection of the objective laws of social development, thereby helping the proletariat to carry out revolution. Pragmatism's "theory of effect" is a subjective idealist theory that is fundamentally contrary to Marxism's theory of reflection.

Marxism believes that the effect of a doctrine is the role it plays in social history, that is, the role it plays in social practice. Therefore, judging whether its effect is good or bad is not based on individual subjective wishes and the impact on the individual, but on the requirements of social development and the impact on social production and class struggle. The effects produced by a doctrine in society are ultimately determined by whether it correctly reflects the development of objective things and their laws. As we have argued above, Hu Shih's criticism of the role of ancient Chinese thought is individualistic and subjectivist, divorced from social practice.

Marxism also believes that the evaluation of the historical significance of a doctrine cannot be separated from the specific social and historical conditions in which it was produced. All doctrines that reflect the needs of social and economic development at that time and the interests of the masses of the people, thereby promoting social progress, have progressive significance under the historical conditions at that time. Conversely, all theories that hinder and confront the social and economic development at that time are reactionary. This is the only objective standard for evaluating thoughts and doctrines in history. As we have argued above, Hu Shih's evaluation of ancient Chinese thought is anti-scientific and anti-historicist.

	Concluding Remarks

What has been argued above are the subjective idealist and vulgar evolutionist viewpoints and methods that run through the entire work of Hu Shih's "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy." As for the distortion of ancient thought in individual places in this work, we will not list them in this paper. We believe that the primary task of criticizing Hu Shih's work is to analyze the main spirit that runs through it in order to expose its reactionary essence.

The pragmatic viewpoints and methods disseminated by Hu Shih have been playing a serious harmful role in the research work of Chinese philosophy history. After the May Fourth Movement, some bourgeois historians of philosophy and historians, including Feng Youlan, intentionally or unintentionally inherited Hu Shih's reactionary viewpoints, and guided the research work of Chinese historical science to an anti-scientific path, and its pernicious influence is very great. Further eliminating these pernicious influences and establishing the leading position of Marxism-Leninism thought in Chinese academic work is the urgent task on our current cultural and ideological front.

    批判胡适“中国哲学史大纲”的实用主义观点和方法
    冯友兰　朱伯昆
    胡适在“中国哲学史大纲”中所散布的反动观点，就是美帝国主义的实用主义主观唯心论和庸俗进化论。他的这部书所用的方法，是建立在这个极端腐朽的世界观上，而且是它的具体的应用。这部书实际上是一部实用主义教科书。
    胡适在“中国哲学史大纲”中所散布的关于哲学和哲学史的观点，对中国古代哲学思想发生和发展的解释，对古代哲学思想的评价，都是这种极端反动的主观唯心论和庸俗进化论的表现和应用。我们于以下分四点加以论证。
      一、胡适搬用实用主义的哲学观歪曲哲学史的对象
    实用主义关于哲学和哲学史的观点，同马克思主义对于哲学和哲学史的观点是根本相对立的。胡适在“中国哲学史大纲”中，首先给哲学下了一个定义：“凡研究人生切要的问题，从根本上着想，要寻一个根本的解决。这种学问，叫做哲学。”这是从杜威歪曲哲学的性质的谬论中引申出来的。杜威说：“如果哲学不弄那些‘哲学家的问题’了，如果哲学变成解决‘人的问题’的哲学方法了，那时候便是哲学光复的日子到了。”（胡适“五十年来之世界哲学”）
    所谓“人的问题”或“人生切要的问题”就是他们所说在生活环境中所遇到的“疑难的境地”“困难”。照他们看来，哲学就是解决这些“疑难”或
  “困难”的工具，也就是“应付环境”的“思想方法”。
    实用主义的庸俗进化论认为“许多蛆”，“一个蜜蜂”等动物的“应付环境”，和一个在树林中迷路的人的解决怎样走出树林的问题、科学家葛理赖的怎样证明空气压力的问题，都是一类的事情，都是“应付环境”，仅只“有高下的程度不同”。所谓真理，并不是客观世界及其规律的正确的“反映”，而只是人们“应付环境”的工具，跟“许多蛆”“一个蜜蜂”的“应付环境”是一样的。
    实用主义企图用这种荒谬的理论否认哲学的根本问题，唯物主义和唯心主义两种世界观的对立和斗争的问题。照它的说法，哲学既然主要地是解决
  “人生问题”的方法，唯物主义同唯心主义对立和斗争的问题，就居于次要的地位，可“以不了了之”。实用主义企图以这样的手法掩饰它自己主观唯心论的世界观的实质，以对抗科学的唯物主义。
    马克思主义认为没有脱离社会阶级问题的“人生问题”，任何“人生问题”的解决，都反映着一个阶级的社会观点，都离不开他们的世界观的基础。哲学就是世界观，是社会某一阶级关于整个世界及其规律的观点和观念的总和。无论那一个阶级的哲学，最后都要归结到世界观的基本问题——思维和存在的关系问题。对这个问题的回答，基本上都逃不出唯物主义和唯心主义两大对立的阵营。胡适的“不了了之”，正是给这个问题以主观唯心主义的回答。他企图以抽象的“人生问题”掩盖哲学的阶级性。这正是为大资产阶级服务的实用主义的阶级性的表现。
    哲学史是什么呢？胡适说：“这种种人生切要问题，自古以来，经过了许多哲学家的研究，往往有一个问题发生以后，各人有各人的见解，各人有各人的解决方法……。若有人把种种哲学问题的种种研究法，和种种解决方法，都依着年代的先后，和学派的系统，一一记叙下来，便成了哲学史。”
    哲学都是某一阶级的哲学。哲学家都是为一定阶级服务的。各哲学流派所以有不同的甚至矛盾的见解，因为它们所反映的阶级利益是不同的，甚至矛盾的。掩盖了这一主要的事实，在哲学史中，就只剩下了“各人有各人的见解，各人有各人的解决方法”了。这样，哲学史就成为哲学家们的个人主观意见，个人“应付环境”的“方法”的偶然堆积。照胡适的说法，哲学史工作者的任务，也不过是把这些偶然事件，“一一记叙下来”。其中虽也
  “依着年代的先后和学派的系统”，但是没有什么规律，哲学史依然是一本“糊涂帐”。照我们于下文所指出的，就是在这一点上，胡适也还是照着他的主观唯心论的办法，随意安排的。
    胡适把哲学的内容，归结为方法，因为照实用主义看起来，思想只是解决困难的一种工具，一种方法。实用主义自己也自命为是一种方法。照胡适看来，中国古代思想都成了“应付环境”的“工具”，中国古代哲学家都变成“对付人的问题”的
  “工具主义”者。
    在胡适的“中国哲学史大纲”中，各家的“方法”都是平等排列的。它们都是些“假设”，都是些“方法”，都不反映客观世界及其中的规律，这就抹杀了中国古代哲学思想在一定程度上所反映的客观真理，否认了中国古代哲学史上的根本问题——唯物主义反对唯心主义世界观的斗争，歪曲了古代唯物主义世界观的传统。
    马克思主义认为科学的哲学史是经常代表先进阶级利益的唯物主义世界观反对经常代表反动阶级利益的唯心主义世界观的斗争的历史，也就是唯物主义世界观及其规律发生和发展的历史。这就是哲学史发展的普遍规律、中国哲学思想的发展也同样遵循这个普遍规律。揭露这一规律，是中国哲学史工作者的任务。
    二、胡适搬运实用主义主观唯心论曲解古代思想发生的原因
    实用主义对思想学说发生的原因的解释是同历史唯物主义“社会存在决定社会意识”的科学原则根本相对立的。实用主义不承认思想学说是社会存在在人们头脑中的反映，认为思想学说是个人受生活环境的刺激从而应付事变和解决困难的工具，是个人按照主观愿望捏造出来的东西。照实用主义看来，满足个人主观的欲求和兴趣是思想和学说产生的根本原因。胡适就在这个主观唯心论的基础上，建立他的历史观和“历史方法”。
    在“中国哲学史大纲”中，他也说是要“求因”。他说：“哲学史的目的，不但要指出哲学思想沿革变迁的线索，还须要寻出这些沿革变迁的原因”。“这些原因，约有三种：（甲）个人才性不同；
  （乙）所处的时势不同；（丙）所受的思想学术不同。”这些原因，虽然也都是一般资产阶级哲学史家所常说的，但是胡适的这种说法，还有其实用主义的内容，是实用主义主观唯心论的历史观和方法的具体应用。
    实用主义是从个人出发的：照实用主义的说法，生活是个人的生活；经验是个人的经验；环境是个人的环境；适应是个人的适应。所谓成功失败，满意不满意，也都是个人的。他所谓“才性”，实际上就是个人应付环境的才能，也就是实用主义所谓“创造的智慧”。
    在“诸子不出于王官论”中，胡适说：“一家之兴，无非应时而起，及时变事异，则向之应世之学，翻成无用之文。”在“中国哲学史大纲”中也说：古代各家思想都起源于“种种时势的反动”。所谓
  “时势”就是个人所处的“环境”。他要“对付环境”，在“对付环境”的过程中，遇见有“困难”有“疑难的境地”，他就要想法解决，这就是思想。这也就是所谓“反动”。“反动”就是个人受环境刺激，从而“应付环境”的反应。
    必须指出：胡适所说的“时势”仅只是社会上的表面现象，对古代思想学说的产生，仅起刺激作用。起决定作用的，是社会中的阶级斗争。这是胡适所要掩盖的。
    照胡适所描写的，“诗人时代”（从纪元前第八世纪到前第七世纪）的“时势”，不外乎是“政治那样黑暗，社会那样纷乱，贫富那样不均，民生那样痛苦。有了这种时势，自然会生出种种思想的反动。”但是，“时势”只有“这种”，而思想上的反应，却有“种种”。说到老子孔子的时代，他说：“这个时代的情形既是如此‘无道’，自然总有许多‘有心人’对于这种时势生出种种的反动
  （反应）。”照他说：有三种“反动”；“第一，极端的破坏派”（老子）；“第二，极端的厌世派”；
  “第三，积极的救世派”（孔子）。“时势”相同，而所生的“思潮”可以相反。照他的说法，那就主要地是由于“个人才性”不同了。
    胡适宣称：“时势生思潮，思潮又生时势”。表面上看，好像他是把“时势”同“思潮”平等看待。但是照他的说法，思想是受环境刺激而起的解决困难的工具，“时势”仅只能引起“思潮”，但并不能决定“思潮”的内容；可是，“时势”受了
  “思潮”的影响，“一定有大变动”。这就是说，思潮的“效果”，倒可以决定“时势”的趋势。这就是他的主观唯心论的历史观的本质。
    胡适所说的各哲学家“所受的思想学术不同”，也有其实用主义的内容。实用主义认为个人要应付环境和解决疑难问题，需要向贮藏过去“经验”的思想意识中寻找各种暗示和解决的方法。因此，胡适认为古代哲学家所提出的各种观点，也都来源于以前的思想，或者是受以前的思想的刺激而产生的
  “反动”。据他说：墨家思想的产生，是由于对儒家思想的反动。“因为儒家不信鬼，所以墨子倡‘明鬼论’。因为儒家厚葬久丧，所以墨子倡‘节葬’论，因为儒家重礼乐，所以墨子倡‘非乐’论，因为儒家信天命，所以墨子倡‘非命’论。”这都是向思想意识的本身去寻找思想意识产生的根源。
    胡适还认为古代某些思想流派所以取得支配的地位，而其他思想流派所以逐渐衰落，也只是由于各种思想互相攻击的结果。据他说，中国古代哲学
  “中绝”了。“究竟是为了什么缘故呢？依我的愚见看来，约有四种真原因：（一）是怀疑主义的名学。
  （二）是狭义的功用主义。（三）是专制的一尊主义。（四）是方士派的迷信。”这就是说，思想本身就可以是决定思想发达和衰落的原因。
    这就充分暴露了胡适的唯心史观的本质。
    马克思主义认为，古代哲学思想发生发展的根本原因，必须向古代社会的物质生活条件——生产方式的变革中去寻找。春秋战国时代生产发展引起了巨大的社会经济制度的变革，从而引起阶级斗争的复杂化和深刻化。这是古代各种思想流派产生的真正原因。春秋战国时代出现的各种哲学派别，代表了各种不同阶级的利益。其中所提出的新的观点和学说反映着当时社会经济发展的新的要求。上面所说的孔子老子墨子的思想之所以不同，就是因为他们的思想，是为不同的阶级服务的。某些哲学流派，在当时所以能够逐渐取得统治地位，是和当时逐渐取得统治地位的先进阶级和先进社会集团的利益结合在一起的。某些哲学流派之所以逐渐衰落，这是由于它所代表的阶级势力逐渐没落或削弱。
    三、胡适搬运庸俗进化论任意涂抹古代思想发展的趋势
    胡适所宣扬的“历史的态度”，以及所谓“明变”的方法，正是实用主义庸俗进化论观点的具体的应用。
    他说：“一切变迁都是由微变显，由简易变繁赜”。“由微变显”，“由简易变繁赜”，在他看来，就是一回事。为什么“由简易变繁赜”呢？照他看来，就是因为原来是微细的东西，后来变成显著了。他借庄子书中的几句话，来发挥这种“进化论”。
    庄子“寓言”篇有一句话说：“万物皆种也，以不同形相禅”；“至乐”篇说：“种有几”。这本来是说，物有很多的种类，但是可以互相转化。
  “种有几”是说万物的种类很多，下文庄子举出很多的种。古代人认为一物可化为另一物，如“腐草化为萤”之类。这就是庄子所谓“物化”，是不合事实的臆测，其中并没有从低级到高级的进化的意思。这同科学的进化论毫无共同之处。可是胡适硬把它附会成生物进化论，他把“几”字解释为
  “几微”的意思，他说庄子这几句话的意思“是说生物进化都起于一种极微细的种子，后来渐渐进化，‘以不同形相禅’，从极下等的微生物，一步一步的进到最高等的人。因为生物如此进化，可见那些种子里面，都含有万物的‘可能性’（亦名潜性——原注），所以能渐渐的由这种‘可能性’变为种种物类的‘现形性’（亦名显性——原注）。 又可见生物进化的前一级，便含有后一级的‘可能性’。”照他的这种说法，“万物的‘可能性’”早已包含在原来的“极细微的种子”之中。生物的种类的变化，都不过是“渐渐的”由这种“可能性”变为种种物类的“现形性”。由原有的“可能性”变为“现形性”，就是“由微变显”。生物的种类的增多，体质的进步，是“由简易变繁赜”。胡适认为此二者就是一回事。这是否认自然界有新质态出现的形而上学观点，实际上就是否认进化。
    胡适认为人类社会中的事物，也是照这样的情形“进化”的。人的思想意识的变化也没有在基本上是完全新的思想内容。他说：“人遇困难时，他自然要寻求应付的方法；当此时候，他的过去的经验知识里，应需要的号召，涌出一些暗示的意思来”，据他说，“应付的方法”，就要在这些暗示中去
  “寻求”。因此也不可能有在基本上是完全新的思想。
    他的这种进化论应用到哲学史上，哲学史中也就没有在基本上完全是新的思想了。照他看起来，一个哲学家的思想也只可能在“以前的学术思想”中，去“寻求”解决问题的方法。照他在“中国哲学史大纲”中所描写的，中国古代思想发展的过程，也是“由微变显”“由简易变繁赜”由最初的
  “可能性”渐渐地变为“现形性”的过程。古代思想的发展，只是量的增加或减少，没有质的变化，只是旧思想的补充改良和综合。（例如，他认为，春秋战国时代重要流派的观点，在“诗经”中都有了“种子”，以后的发展只是这些“种子”的由
  “微变显”，而秦汉以后中国思想的发展又只是以前的“折衷混合”而已。）
    胡适还认为一个学派和一个时代思想的显著变化，并不是由于内在的原因，而是由于外来的思想的影响。他认为古代许多流派所提出的新观点，并不是由于它所代表的阶级有了新的要求，而只是各派之间彼此互相影响的结果。秦汉以后，中古和近古时代的哲学思想发展，都是受了印度佛教输入的影响，好像没有印度佛教的输入，秦汉以后就不会出现“新哲学”。他并且认为将来中国的“新哲学”，必须依靠西方资产阶级哲学的输入，否则中国哲学就不会有新的发展。这些观点，不仅暴露了资产阶级唯心史观和世界主义的毒素，也是从庸俗进化论的发展观中引导出来的反科学的谬论。胡适搬运这种观点，自然就抹杀了中国哲学发展的真相，和中国哲学发展所依据的内在的社会经济的物质基础。
    胡适在“中国哲学史大纲”中所标榜的“明变”，并不是追求哲学思想发展的客观规律，只是寻求思想前后的传受的关系和古代思想演变的前后的顺序。就是在这一方面胡适也不是根据充分占有史料和科学地鉴别史料，来确定思想发展的前后顺序的，而是按着庸俗进化论的观点，任意安排史料，主观制造思想发展的线索。他宣称，中国古代思想发展的历史只是“一步一步，循序渐进的思想发达史”，否认思想发展过程中的渐进的中断和质的变化，这也就是他所说的“一线相承”的实际内容。胡适根据这种庸俗进化论的观点，荒谬地认为“老子”书所表现的观点应该是“诗经”“伐檀”篇思想的继续，并且把战国末年易传的世界观硬加在春秋时代孔子的头上，把魏晋时代的“杨朱篇”，硬说成是庄子以前的思想，用来说明他自己所捏造的古代思想的“循序渐进”的线索。不仅如此，他还武断地靠所谓“学说变迁的线索”来决定
  一些著作的时代。认为在有些不同的观点中间，应该有一种承上启下的东西，才合乎“渐进”的自然的顺序。根据这种办法，他得出了“大学”“中庸”等著作应该出现在孟子和荀子以前的结论。胡适所吹嘘的“历史的态度”，实际上是反历史的。
    马克思主义认为人类观念形态发展的历史，跟自然和社会发展的历史一样，是受辩证法的发展的普通规律支配的。伴随着中国社会发展的每一个历史阶段，中国思想发展的历史都具有质的变化，当中国社会内部出现了新的经济因素和新的阶级力量，必然出现与之相应的新的意识形态，而且这种新的意识形态又是在跟代表旧社会势力的意识形态的激烈斗争中发展起来的。新旧思想的矛盾斗争，就是中国思想发展的规律。春秋战国时代出现的各个流派思想的发展，就是在这个规律的支配下进行的。
    马克思主义认为观念形态发展中的继承性和联系性，绝不是什么单纯的“思想的血统关系”，而是代表一定阶级利益的思想家，按照本阶级的经济要求，去继承或扬弃他们前辈所创造的思想资料的，经济和阶级利益本身决定着思想和观点改变的方向。中国古代某些思想流派，在形式上虽然继承了它们前辈的某些观点，但它们却代表着不同的阶级利益，因而也就获得了在本质上同前辈不同的新的内容和新的形态。后期儒家的代表荀子和战国出现的法家思想正是在这个规律的支配下建立起他们自己的体系的。
      四、胡适搬用实用主义的“效果论”任意评判古代思想学说的价值
    实用主义对于思想学说的评价的标准是同马克思主义的反映论和历史主义的科学观点根本相对立的。实用主义的“效果论”是胡适对于古代思想学说进行评价底基础。实用主义不承认有客观真理，它认为“真理”只是用来满足个人欲望和“应付环境”的工具。它由此也就认为，对于一种思想学说评价的标准，就是看它能否产生对个人有利的“效果”。
    胡适说：“这些效果，大概可分为三种：（甲）要看一家学说在同时的思想，和后来的思想上，发生何种影响。（乙）要看一家学说在风俗政治上，发生何种影响。（丙）要看一家学说的结果，可造出什么样的人格来。”他所说的这三种“效果”跟他在讲“求因”的时候所说的三种因，是一贯的。
    胡适说：实用主义是个哲学方法，这个方法中有所谓“历史的方法”即“祖孙的方法”。这个方法“从来不把一个制度或学说看作一个孤立的东西，总把他看作一个中段：一头是他所以发生的原因，一头是他自己发生的效果；上头有他的祖父，下面有他的子孙。捉住了这两头，他再也逃不出去了”。他的这种“历史的方法”，其实就是实用主义的工具主义的表现。照上面所说的，他认为一个学说，都有三个祖父，也都有三个子孙。
    胡适的“中国哲学史大纲”正是照着这个方法写的。他标榜“明变”，“求因”，是要捉着一个学说的“上头”，他标榜“评判”，是要捉着它的“下头”。他所用的这个方法的内容，就是用主观唯心论及庸俗进化论去捉一个学说的“上头”，用实用主义的“效果论”来捉一个学说的“下头”，这就是他所用的方法的反动本质。
    用实用主义“效果论”的看法，“每一家学说所发生的……效果的价值，便是那种学说的价值。”这就是说：一种学说并没有本身的价值，它只是一种工具。它的价值就看它有用或没有用。胡适正是运用这种主观唯心论的观点“评判”古代一切学说的价值。
    胡适用这种实用主义的“效果论”“评判”哲学史上的学说，就必然抹杀了一种学说在历史上所应有的意义。
    胡适说：“我说的评判，并不是把做哲学史的人自己的眼光，来批评古人的是非得失。那种‘主观的’评判，没有什么大用处。如今所说，乃是‘客观的’评判。”但把实用主义的真理论，应用在哲学史上，所有的评判必然是“主观的”评判，也就是以他自己的眼光批评古人的是非得失。胡适对于哲学史主要各家的评判，经常是随着他底主子——美帝国主义和买办资产阶级的需要而任意捏造，随时变动。
    在五四运动时代，美帝国主义和买办资产阶级的利益是在基本上维持中国封建主义的统治，而加以某种程度的改革，以适合帝国主义的需要。胡适在这个时候，也把孔子说成是“有志于政治改良”的“积极救世派”，借以宣传他的反动的改良主义。在抗日战争前夕，在他所发表的“说儒”中，他按照帝国主义的要求，把孔子说成是亡国遗民的大教主，借以替蒋介石宣传不抵抗主义。现在他在台湾，又把孔子说成是自由主义者，为美帝国主义所制造的“自由中国”找理论根据。
    在五四运动时代，为了要伪装进步，歪曲革命，胡适把老子说成是“革命家”，有“一种革命的政治哲学”。在第二次国内革命战争时期，他先后发表了“从农村救济到无为的政治”（独立评论四十九期），“再论无为政治”（独立评论八十九期）等反动的论文，借老子的“无为”思想，要求国民党反动派政府停止一切建设，尽全力维持“社会秩序”，就是说，用全力打共产党。在“说儒”中，为了准备亡国，他又说，老子并不是“革命家”，也没有什么“革命的政治哲学”，而仅只是提倡“亡国遗民”的柔道。现在他在台湾，为了诬蔑我们的政府，又大赞扬老子底“无为”思想，说它是反对
  “极权”的无政府主义。
    墨子是他在“中国哲学史大纲”中所极力赞扬的，因为他可以利用附会墨子的某些观点，宣传实用主义。后来在第二次国内革命时期，在他的“中古哲学史”中，他又讥笑墨家“牺牲自己而乐利天下”的兼爱学说是“违反人情的人生观”。现在他在台湾，又说墨子是极“反动”的人物，因为他主张
  “尚同”，“尚同”就是“极权政治”，从而诬蔑我们的人民民主专政。
    帝国主义在垂死时代，它就是认为真伪是非的标准，可以随着它的“方便”而随时变动。昨天签字的条约，今天就可以作废。今天发的宣言，明天又可以不算。胡适对于哲学史中各种学说的评判，也就是这一类的思想的表现。
    这就是胡适标榜的“客观的评判”的反动实质。这种极端腐朽的反理性的主观唯心论的观点，就是他对待祖国文化遗产的“历史的态度”。
    马克思主义的反映论认为一种学说的本身价值，在于它在一定程度上正确地反映客观实在。如果它能对于人类社会有用，那正是因为它在一定程度上反映客观规律，列宁说：“马克思学说之所以万能，就是因为它正确。”马克思主义理论的价值在于它正确地反映了社会发展的客观规律，因而能帮助无产阶级进行革命。实用主义的“效果论”正是跟马克思的反映论根本相违的主观唯心论。
    马克思主义，认为一种学说的效果，就是它对社会历史所起的作用，也就是在社会实践中所起的作用。因此，评判它的效果的好坏，并不是依据个人主观的愿望和对个人所起的影响，而是依据社会发展的要求和对社会生产及阶级斗争所起的作用。一种学说在社会上所产生的效果，归根结底决定于它是否正确反映了客观事物的发展及其规律。照我们在上面所论证的，胡适对中国古代思想所起的作用的评判是脱离社会实践的个人主义的和主观主义的。
    马克思主义还认为对于一种思想学说的历史意义的评价，不能脱离产生它们的社会历史的具体条件。凡是反映了当时社会经济向前发展的需要和人民群众的利益，从而推动社会前进的学说，在当时底历史条件下就具有进步的意义。反之，凡阻碍和对抗当时社会经济向前发展的理论，就是反动的。这就是对于历史上思想和学说评价的唯一的客观标准。照我们在上面所论证的，胡适对中国古代思想的评价是反科学的反历史主义的。
      结束语
    以上所论证的是贯穿在胡适“中国哲学史大纲”整个著作中的主观唯心论和庸俗进化论的观点和方法。至于这个著作中的个别地方对于古代思想所进行的歪曲，我们在这篇论文里，就不加论列了。我们认为：批判胡适的这个著作的首要任务，是把贯穿于其中的主要精神，分析出来，以暴露它的反动的本质。
    胡适所散布的实用主义观点和方法，对于中国哲学史的研究工作，一直起着严重的危害作用。五四运动以后，某些资产阶级哲学史家和历史学家，其中包括冯友兰，有意无意地继承了胡适的反动观点，把中国历史科学的研究工作，引导到反科学的道路上去，其流毒是很大的。进一步肃清这些流毒，树立起马克思列宁主义思想在中国学术工作中的领导地位，就是我们当前文化思想战线上的迫切任务。
