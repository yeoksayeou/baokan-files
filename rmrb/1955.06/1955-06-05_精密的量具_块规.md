Precision Measuring Tool - Gauge Blocks
By our reporter Jin Yukun

    In a meticulously arranged room at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory—the gauge block workshop—they are trial-manufacturing China's first batch of the most precise measuring tools.

    When we arrived at the entrance of this workshop, the comrades inside asked us to change into specially prepared leather slippers to avoid bringing dust from the outside into the room. Pushing open the door, we were greeted by bright, tender green painted walls, clean and shining red magnesite flooring, and tall, spacious windows. In this room, special equipment maintains the temperature at 20 degrees Celsius, with a variance of no more than one degree; other specialized equipment ensures that dust does not exceed five ten-millionths of a kilogram per cubic meter of air. The young men and women working at the benches or in front of optical instruments all wear white work uniforms, looking very neat and clean.

    The comrades here told us that without these special conditions, manufacturing precision measuring tools would be impossible.

    One comrade opened a delicate wooden box for us. Inside were many bright, shiny steel blocks of varying sizes and thicknesses. They said: These are the most precise measuring tools—gauge blocks. To the uninitiated, they might seem like simple steel blocks. But we learned here that when manufacturing various mechanical parts in a machine factory, it's necessary to know whether the processing is good, and whether all dimensions and geometric shapes meet the requirements. This requires using measuring tools (commonly micrometers, dial indicators, calipers, etc.) for measurement. However, how can we judge and guarantee the accuracy of these measuring tools themselves? This requires using the most precise measuring tool—gauge blocks—for comparison and calibration. Therefore, gauge blocks are the benchmark for mechanical measurement. At the same time, measuring tools like micrometers can only measure tolerances to one-hundredth of a millimeter, but manufacturing precision products such as bearings and plug gauges requires tolerances of only a few thousandths. At this point, ordinary measuring tools cannot measure its precision, and gauge blocks must be used for comparison. Thus, the precision of the gauge blocks themselves must be even more stringent. The most precise gauge blocks must have a tolerance of seven hundred-thousandths of a millimeter, which means there cannot be a difference of even one-thousandth the thickness of a hair. To an outsider, this is simply unimaginable. Therefore, manufacturing such precise products is very difficult and complex.

    To manufacture precision products, producers need a relatively high level of cultural and scientific understanding. Some people have a relatively low level of education, and are now taking courses at spare-time cultural and technical schools. Every Tuesday and Friday, Soviet experts also teach technical theory classes on gauge block manufacturing.

    The main work of this workshop is grinding. Since there are no suitable machines available today to completely replace manual grinding, both machine grinding and manual grinding are performed here. Manual grinding relies mainly on experience, so it is even more difficult.

    However, with the specific guidance of Comrade Bagen, a Soviet expert with more than ten years of experience in manufacturing gauge blocks, coupled with the tenacious learning spirit of these young people, difficulties have not been able to stop them.

    The young Sun Shilian felt very difficult when he first started learning. He watched the expert pushing the steel block back and forth on the flat plate with both hands, and it seemed very simple. But when he tried it himself, his fingers became swollen, painful, and numb. What was even more troubling was that the ground product always had a "protruding belly" and he could not grind it flat. Sometimes it seemed very flat, but it changed as soon as it cooled down. When the expert saw him worried, he told him: "Don't panic, this work takes time to learn slowly." And he pointed out that the reason for the "protruding belly" was the law of thermal expansion and contraction. Because his hands were holding the ends of the steel block, and the temperature of his hands caused the ends of the plane to expand after a long time of grinding. When grinding, this protruding part was ground away, and after cooling, it shrunk back, turning into a high middle with low ends. The expert said that when grinding, both hands can only hold the rubber sheet. Because rubber does not conduct heat.

    After the "protruding belly" problem was solved, a "concave belly" problem came up, which turned out to be the middle of the flat plate being high. So the expert helped correct the flat plate. After the "concave belly" problem was solved, a "black belly" problem came up. Sun Shilian tried to grind hard, but when he saw the steel block turn black, he asked the expert, and he learned that if the grinding time was too long, the friction would be too great, and the temperature of the steel block would be too high and it would change color. He had to pay attention to applying more stearin and gasoline.

    Sun Shilian failed to grind three blocks in a row, which made him laugh and cry. The expert came over and grinded a sample for him to see. He still had difficulties grinding himself, so the expert held his hand and taught him, until he learned almost, and then left.

    With the patient help of the Soviet expert, the entire workshop has made particularly rapid progress. Sun Shilian achieved a precision of two ten-thousandths when grinding the fourth block. Zhang Fengtai, Dong Huiqing, Yu Guiqing, Li Fengzhi and others have initially mastered the technology in a very short period of time, and many workers have begun to operate independently.

    The gauge block workshop began the trial production task of the entire set of gauge blocks (eighty-seven pieces in each set) in February this year. Soon, China's first batch of self-made, most precise, and longer lapped gauge blocks will be born. It will supply our automobile factories, aircraft manufacturing plants, and all precision machinery manufacturing plants with the most precise measuring tools made by ourselves. (Attached picture)

    精密的量具——块规
    本报记者　金雨困
    在哈尔滨量具刃具厂的一个精致的房间——块规工段里，正在试造我国第一批最精密的量具。
    我们走到这个工段门口时，车间里的同志让我们换上特备的皮拖鞋，以免把外边的灰尘带进屋里去。一推开门，出现在我们面前的是鲜明的嫩绿色的油漆墙壁，干净发亮的红色菱苦土地板和高大宽敞的窗户。在这个屋子里，有专门的设备把温度控制在摄氏二十度，不能上下相差一度；一些特置的设备还使灰尘在每立方公尺的空气中不超过一千万分之五公斤。在工作台边或在光学仪器前工作的年青小伙子和姑娘们，一律穿着白色的工作服，十分整齐干净。
    这里的同志告诉我们，如果没有这些特殊条件，要制造精密的量具是不可能的。
    一位同志为我们打开了一只精致的木盒。里面装着许多大小不同厚薄不同的亮晶晶的钢块。他们说：这就是最精密的量具——块规。不懂的人看起来，似乎只不过是一些很简单的钢块。但是我们从这里了解到：在机械制造工厂里生产各种机械零件的时候，需要知道它加工得好不好，一切尺寸和几何形状符合不符合要求，这就需要用量具（常用的有千分尺、千分表、卡钳等）来测量。但是，怎样才能判断和保证这些量具本身的精确程度呢？这就需要用量具中最精密的量具——块规，来进行比较和校正。因此块规是机械测量的基准。同时，像千分尺等量具最多只能量到公差百分之一公厘，而制造精密的产品，如轴承和塞规等，只有千分之几的公差。这时，一般的量具就无法测量它的精密度，就非要用块规来比较不可。这样，块规本身的精密度就要求得更加严格了。最精密的块规，公差要达到十万分之七公厘，也就是说，不能有一根头发丝粗的千分之一的差异。外行人听来，这简直是不可想像的。所以，要制造这样精密的产品，是非常困难和复杂的。
    为了制造精密产品，生产者需要有比较高的文化科学水平。有的人文化水平比较低，现在都在业余文化技术学校进修，每星期二、五还由苏联专家讲授关于块规制造的技术理论课。
    这个工段的主要工作是进行研磨。由于今天还没有适当的机器可以完全代替手工研磨，因此这里同时有机床研磨和手工研磨两种操作。手工研磨主要是凭经验，所以困难就更多。
    但是，这里有一位具有十多年制造块规经验的苏联专家巴根同志在具体指导，再加上这批青年人的顽强学习精神，因此，困难并没有能挡住他们。
    年青的孙士连在开始学习的时候感到非常困难。他看看专家两只手在平板上来回推动着，好像挺简单。但自己一磨，手指就肿疼发麻了。更伤脑筋的是，磨出来的东西老是“凸肚子”，怎么也磨不平。有的时候好像磨得很平，但一冷下来就变了样。专家看到他发愁，就告诉他：“别慌，这项工作要慢慢的才能学会。”并指出“凸肚子”的原因是热胀冷缩的规律在作怪。因为用手把着钢块两头，磨久了，手的温度使平面的两头膨胀起来，磨时就把这凸出的部分磨去，待一凉又往回缩，就变成中间凸两头低了。专家说，在磨时两只手只能把在胶皮上。因为胶皮是不传热的。
    “凸肚子”的问题解决了，又来了个“凹肚子”的问题，原来是平板中间高了。于是专家又帮助校正平板。“凹肚子”的问题解决了，又来了个“黑肚子”的问题。孙士连使劲地磨，一看钢块变了黑色，去问专家，才知道磨的时间长了，磨擦力太大，钢块热度太高就会变色，要注意多涂硬脂和汽油才行。
    孙士连一连三块都没有磨成功，弄得哭笑不得。专家就走过来磨个样子给他看。他自己磨还有困难，专家就又把着他的手教，一直看到他学得差不多了，才离开。
    在苏联专家这样耐心的帮助下，整个工段都进步得特别快。孙士连在磨第四块时，精密度就达到了万分之二。张凤台、董会清、庾桂清、李凤芝等人都在很短时间内初步掌握了技术，许多工人都能开始独立地操作了。
    块规工段在今年二月份开始了整付块规（每付八十七块）的试制任务。不久，我国第一批自制的最精密的研磨较长的块规就要诞生了。它将供给我们的汽车厂、飞机制造厂和一切精密的机械制造厂以自己制造的最精密的量具。（附图片）
