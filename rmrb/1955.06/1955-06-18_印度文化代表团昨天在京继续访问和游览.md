    (Dispatch) The Indian Cultural Delegation continued to visit and tour in the capital yesterday.
    In the morning, the distinguished guests visited the Asian Students Sanatorium located in the scenic Western Hills. Since its opening, this sanatorium has helped forty-seven students from Korea, Vietnam, and China to regain their health and return to their studies. The Deputy Director, Wang Yangwen, informed the guests that the sanatorium is preparing to welcome students from Asian countries such as India and Indonesia for treatment.
    All the visitors put on white work clothes and masks as they entered the ward building. The patient rooms all faced south and were filled with sunlight. The colors of the window curtains and interior walls were very soft. There were fresh flowers by the beds and paintings on the walls. In the corridors, several patients and nurses were playing chess and cards, and the sound of a piano came from the recreation room. Doctors, nurses, and patients welcomed their friends from afar with smiles.
    The guests visited the operating room, X-ray room, and physiotherapy room. This sanatorium is a product of international student unity and friendship. Here, the guests saw various state-of-the-art medical equipment donated by youth student groups from the Soviet Union, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. Mr. Chanda browsed through several Indian publications in the library. Indian literary classics donated by Indian students were placed alongside world literature classics. There were Indian newspapers published in New Delhi and Calcutta on the newspaper rack.
    The guests overlooked the beautiful scenery of the Western Hills from the spacious and bright solarium. Mr. Chanda praised the beautiful surroundings of the sanatorium. He humorously said: "A patient is halfway to recovery as soon as they arrive here." The host pointed to several buildings in the scenic area and told the guests that several other workers' sanatoriums will soon be completed.
    Before leaving, Mr. Chanda said: "Chinese students have done a great humanitarian work for Asian students."
    In the afternoon, the Indian artists came to the Temple of Heaven, surrounded by pine and cypress trees.
    The world-renowned beautiful building, the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, aroused continuous admiration from the visitors from afar. Mrs. Chanda, a famous Indian painter, constantly gazed at this serene and magnificent scene. Many delegates were busy opening their cameras to capture this wonderful scene. While visiting the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, Mr. Chanda particularly admired the tall, gilded pillars supporting this circular hall.
    A group of elementary school students who came to the park to review their lessons raised their hands to salute the guests. The guests greeted them in Chinese, saying, "Hello!" The children responded loudly, "Hello to you!"
    In a corridor leading out of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, many members of the delegation were attracted by the Beijing scenic photographs and special Chinese handicrafts sold by the Temple of Heaven service center. Mrs. Chanda specially selected two colored photographs of the Temple of Heaven buildings, and several female dancers picked out some decorations and small toys.
    The Indian artists visited the Echo Wall with great interest. Mr. and Mrs. Chanda stood on opposite sides of the Echo Wall and responded to each other in Indian. Many members also ran to the Echo Wall and cheerfully called out to each other like children, listening to the echoes brought by this marvelous building.

    印度文化代表团昨天在京继续访问和游览
    本报讯　印度文化代表团昨天继续在首都参观和游览。
    上午，贵宾们参观了座落在西山风景区的亚洲学生疗养院。这座疗养院开幕以来，已经有四十七位朝鲜、越南和中国的学生恢复健康，回到了学习岗位。副院长王仰文向贵宾们介绍说：疗养院正在准备迎接印度、印度尼西亚等亚洲国家的学生来院疗养。
    全体参观者穿上白色的工作服，带上口罩，走进了病房大楼。病室全部朝南、阳光充足。窗幔和室内墙壁的颜色都很柔和。床头有鲜花、壁上有画。走廊里，几位疗养员和护士在下棋、打扑克，文娱厅里传来了丁冬的琴声。医生、护士和疗养员用微笑向远方来的朋友表示欢迎。
    贵宾们参观了手术室、X光室、理疗室。这座疗养院是国际学生团结和友谊的产物。贵宾们在这里看见了苏联、德国、捷克斯洛伐克等国家的青年学生团体赠送的各种最新式的医疗器械设备。钱达先生在图书馆里翻阅了几本印度出版物。印度学生赠送的印度文学名著，和世界各国的文学名著放在一起。报架上有新德里和加尔各答出版的印度报纸。
    贵宾们从宽敞明亮的日光室远眺西山胜景。钱达先生极口赞美疗养院四周环境的优美。他诙谐地说：病人一到这里，病就好了一半了。主人指着风景区的几座建筑物告诉客人：那里，另外几座工人疗养院已将完工。
    临别的时候，钱达先生说：中国学生为亚洲学生做了一件人道主义的伟大的工作。
    下午，印度的艺术家们来到了松柏环绕的天坛。
    闻名世界的美丽建筑物祈年殿引起了远方来客不住的赞赏。印度著名的画家钱达夫人不断凝视这静穆瑰丽的景象。许多代表都忙着打开自己的照相机，摄取这一美妙的镜头。在祈年殿中参观时，钱达先生特别欣赏支撑这座圆形大殿的那些沥粉贴金的高大圆柱。
    一群到公园来温习功课的小学生，举手向贵宾们致敬。贵宾们用中国话问着：“你好！”孩子们响亮地回答着：“你们好！”
    在走出祈年殿的一个过廊里，代表团的许多团员被天坛服务处出售的一些北京风景照片和中国特种手工艺品吸引住了。钱达夫人特别选中了两张天坛建筑物的彩色照片，几位女舞蹈家挑选了一些装饰品和小玩具。
    印度艺术家们怀着极大的兴趣参观了回音壁。钱达先生和夫人分别站到回音壁的两侧，用印度语互相呼应着。许多团员也分别跑到回音壁前，像孩子般喜悦地互相传呼着，倾听着这一奇妙建筑物所带来的回声。
