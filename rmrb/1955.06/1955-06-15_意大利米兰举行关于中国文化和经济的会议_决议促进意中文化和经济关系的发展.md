    Xinhua News Agency, June 14th. TASS, Rome, June 13th: A conference on Chinese culture and economy was recently held in Milan, Italy. Attending the conference were former Prime Minister Parri, Banfi, Chairman of the "Italy-Soviet Union Association," Francesco, President of the University of Milan, the famous orientalist and expert in religious history, Pitazzoni, as well as other political activists, scientists, writers, and representatives of some major Italian industrial companies and banks. Speakers at the conference emphasized the need to develop trade and cultural ties with the People's Republic of China. Many speakers also pointed out that Italy has done very little in establishing normal economic relations with China.
    The conference passed two resolutions. One resolution hoped that Italian universities and cultural and educational institutions would study Chinese history, art, and literature, and raised the issue of Italy needing to develop cultural ties with the People's Republic of China. The other resolution called for the elimination of all political obstacles hindering trade with China. This resolution suggested sending an Italian industrial and commercial delegation to the People's Republic of China to specifically study the possibilities of establishing more fruitful trade relations between the two countries.
