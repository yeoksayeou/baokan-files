The Youth Library of He Zhuang Township
By our reporter Lü Jianzhong

At the entrance of the Youth Library in He Zhuang Township, Xuchang County, Henan Province, people crowd to borrow books every day at noon or after dinner. There are members of agricultural producers' cooperatives, members of the Communist Youth League, and children wearing red scarves. Wang Xijin, the head of the Mingxing First Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, first borrowed a book entitled "How to be a Good Head of an Agricultural Producers' Cooperative" and kept it with him to study at any time. Ren Genxiu, a young member of the cooperative, borrowed a picture book called "Guliya's Road" and shared it with everyone while working in the fields every day. He Binghe, a graduate of elementary school who participates in agricultural production labor, is borrowing "Modern Chinese History" according to his learning requirements and interests.

Recently, all eight agricultural producers' cooperatives in the township are discussing reasonable distribution and consolidation of the cooperatives. Therefore, books such as "How Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives Distribute Harvests" and "How to Consolidate Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives" were eagerly borrowed.

This youth library has more than 8,000 books. These were gifts given to the farmers of the township by the workers of the Xuchang Tobacco Re-drying Factory and the students of the Xuchang First Senior High School when they came to hold a joint celebration with the farmers of the whole township on "May Day" International Labor Day this year. The workers and students encouraged them to study hard and improve agricultural output. The farmers also presented two red flags to their guests.

Now this youth library has become an indispensable spiritual food for the farmers of the whole township. The farmers affectionately write letters to tell the friends who donated the books about their learning gains. Wei Jinfeng, a member of the agricultural producers' cooperative who was elected as the director of this library, wrote in a letter to the workers of the Xuchang Tobacco Re-drying Factory: Reading these books has made us more clear about the road of mutual aid and cooperation and socialism, and deepened the friendship between our workers and farmers.

    贺庄乡的青年图书馆
    本报记者　吕建中
    河南省许昌县贺庄乡的青年图书馆门口，每天中午或晚饭后都拥挤着借书的人，有农业生产合作社社员，有青年团员，也有挂着红领巾的孩子们。明星第一农业生产合作社社长王西金第一次先借了一本“怎样当好农业生产合作社社长”带在身边随时学习，青年社员任根袖借了一本“古丽雅的道路”连环图，每天下地劳动时和大家一起看。参加了农业生产劳动的高小毕业生贺丙和根据自己的学习要求和兴趣，他正借阅着“中国近代史”。
    最近全乡八个农业生产合作社在讨论合理分配和整顿巩固社的问题，因此“农业生产合作社怎样分配收获物”和“怎样巩固农业生产合作社”等几种书就被争借一空。
    这个青年图书馆拥有八千多本书籍，这是今年
  “五一”国际劳动节那天，许昌烟叶复烤厂的工人和许昌第一高级中学的学生们来和全乡农民举行联欢会的时候赠送给他们的。工人和学生们鼓励他们好好学习，提高农业产量；农民们也把两面红旗献给了自己的客人。
    现在这个青年图书馆已经成为全乡农民的不可缺少的精神食粮。农民们亲切地把自己的学习收获写信告诉赠书的友人。被选为这个图书馆的主任、农业生产合作社社员魏金凤在写给许昌烟叶复烤厂工人的一封信上写道：看了这些书使我们更明确了互助合作、社会主义的道路，加深了咱们工人和农民的友谊。
