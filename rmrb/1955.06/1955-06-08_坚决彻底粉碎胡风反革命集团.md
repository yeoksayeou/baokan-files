    Resolutely and thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique
    Thoroughly investigate all the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique
    Letter from Chen Ruoshui, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: When I was in Korea, far away from the motherland, and saw the materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party clique published in the "People's Daily," I more clearly realized the extreme reactionary nature of the Hu Feng clique. Since the literary and art circles enthusiastically launched discussions and criticisms of the Hu Feng issue, I have also been concerned about the victory on the literary and art front of the motherland. At that time, I thought that Hu Feng was only a problem of ideology. Now that it has been exposed, I realize that for more than 20 years he has been attacking the Party under the guise of Marxism, trying to use despicable means to seize the literary and art front led by the Party to achieve his anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary goals.
    Although I am a volunteer soldier, I love literary works very much; they are an indispensable spiritual food in our army, and they inspire our fighting will. In order to eliminate the erosion of bourgeois reactionary ideas in literary and art circles and purify the revolutionary ranks, all our literary and art workers and the people of the whole country must resolutely and thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.
    Letter from Ke Yuan, Youth Department of the Political Department of the Guangzhou Military Region: I am a revolutionary soldier. When we saw the first and second batches of shocking materials about the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary clique in the "People's Daily," and Hu Feng's "self-criticism" which did not contain a single word of truth, we felt extremely indignant. We believe that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is an extremely dangerous group that ambushes the motherland by throwing "cluster grenades" behind our backs under a sinister "smile."
    For Hu Feng, such a stubbornly unrepentant and resolute counter-revolutionary element, we fully support the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to remove Hu Feng from all positions in the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Writers Association, and the "People's Literature" editorial department, and to expel him from membership. At the same time, we hope that his qualification as a deputy to the National People's Congress will be revoked promptly in accordance with the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries, and that he will be severely punished.
    There are many followers of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and some are extremely stubborn. We warn the members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique that if you can honestly confess, hand over the evidence of your crimes, and start anew, you can still be given leniency by the people. If you are still obsessed and refuse to turn back, you will indeed be smashed in front of the people's copper walls and iron walls like "flies and mosquitoes." The power of the people is strong, the people cannot be insulted, and the tolerance of the people is also limited. We suggest that the Party, government, military leading organs, and literary and art organizations must force Hu Feng's followers to hand over the list of their counter-revolutionary clique, and thoroughly examine each of them to find out all their criminal activities. Except for those who sincerely repent and have actual performance, they should all be purged from various organizations in our revolutionary camp and punished according to law.
    Letter from Sun Mingli, Licheng Middle School, Shandong Province: Since the "People's Daily" published Shu Wu's "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," my angry feelings could no longer be suppressed, and I wanted to write to the "People's Daily" several times to denounce the crimes of the Hu Feng clique. Before my letter was sent, I saw the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" published in the "People's Daily" on May 24. At this time, my heart was about to explode! Whose interests do the members of the Hu Feng clique serve by what they do? What is the difference between them and the cultural agents of the Kuomintang bandit gang? They pretended to be progressive and purposefully infiltrated revolutionary organizations to carry out sabotage. This is our most dangerous enemy. I believe that the qualification of Hu Feng, the chief culprit of this anti-Party clique, as a deputy to the National People's Congress should be revoked immediately according to law, and a serious and thorough investigation should be made into what other counter-revolutionary activities they have that "cannot be touched," so as to completely defeat this reactionary clique, maintain the purity and combat effectiveness of our revolutionary ranks, and defend the fruits of victory that we have worked so hard to achieve.
    Letter from Tian Shichang, Hegezhuang, Ninth District, Tong County, Hebei Province: I am a rural youth who loves literature and art. In the past few years since liberation, I have learned a lot from various literary works and gained a lot of knowledge and inspiration. Therefore, I feel that my mind is much richer and more open than before. I feel that writers are my good teachers and friends, so I respect them and love them. A few days ago, after I saw the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" in the newspaper, I couldn't suppress the anger in my heart. Hu Feng is an enemy of the people and does not deserve to be called a writer or to be respected.
    Therefore, we ask the Party and the government to quickly revoke all of Hu Feng's positions and give him severe punishment according to law.
    Those in the Hu Feng clique who have no intention of repentance, are obsessed, and refuse to confess should also be punished.
    I think that we should be merciless to the enemy, to the enemy who destroys today's socialist construction, and to the enemy who destroys the people's democratic power.
    Letter from the study group of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Nursery: After seeing the two batches of materials exposing Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities, they aroused the infinite anger of our group members. The Hu Feng clique is the most insidious counter-revolutionary clique that has organized and planned to pretend to be progressive and infiltrate the revolutionary camp. He uses the "cluster grenade" tactic, the "Sun Wukong going into the belly" tactic, to destroy the revolutionary cause from inside and outside. It is easy to dodge a spear in the open, but hard to guard against an arrow in the dark. Hu Feng has been wearing the cloak of Marxism for more than 20 years, secretly doing anti-Party and anti-people activities. He is really extremely vicious and shameless. We thank the Party for its wise and decisive action in exposing this criminal clique in a timely manner, educating us, and arousing our vigilance. We suggest that the relevant departments thoroughly investigate the conspiracies and tricks of the Hu Feng anti-Party clique and eliminate the toxins spread among young people. We are childcare workers, teaching and raising the flowers of our motherland – the new generation – every day. We will never allow this nine-tailed fox to mix in our ranks.
    Letter from Zheng Bangwu, Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School, Guangxi Province: I warmly support the resolution to expel Hu Feng from the Chinese Writers Association. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is not only our enemy in thought, but also our enemy in politics. Hu Feng once wore the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, carrying out anti-Party and anti-people activities, spreading bourgeois idealist ideas, and hostile to Chairman Mao's literary and art policies. His works poisoned many young readers. Therefore, we must thoroughly eliminate the reactionary ideological influence of Hu Feng in all aspects.
    Strengthen political theory study and enhance revolutionary vigilance
    Letter from Liao Jingtian, Li Zhanwu and 102 other staff members of the headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association: After reading the materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we felt extremely angry. The Hu Feng clique was not just a group with reactionary views on literary and artistic thought, but a complete counter-revolutionary organization. They have a counter-revolutionary program, a strict organization, and a complete set of special agent activities. On the surface, they support the Communist Party and the revolution, but in reality, they are so opposed to the Communist Party, the revolution, and the people. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is attacking us so viciously that we must resolutely and thoroughly crush it and let them forever remember that the people cannot be bullied. The counter-revolutionary crimes of the Hu Feng clique are already ironclad, and it is absolutely necessary to severely punish them according to law.
    We deeply realize that the struggle led by the Party to crush the Hu Feng clique is a very specific education in class struggle for us. The Party has repeatedly taught us that during the transition period, class struggle will not only not be eased, but will become more complex and acute. Therefore, we must always maintain a high degree of political vigilance. We have once again learned this truth. The Hu Feng clique was able to deceive some people because their theoretical level and political level were not high, giving them the opportunity to deceive. Therefore, we must strengthen our ideological armaments, and we must study Marxism-Leninism hard, and study dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Marxism-Leninism is the most reliable demon-revealing mirror. By mastering it, we can distinguish the ugly faces of all reactionaries. Studying Marxism-Leninism is the most basic method to improve our political consciousness and theoretical level. Studying hard is to enhance our antitoxin against hostile ideas.
    We must resolutely and thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. All members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique must thoroughly confess and await the people's disposal. We will never allow them to "play dead," muddle through, hide, or lie dormant, so that they can continue to harm the revolutionary cause.
    Letter from Wu Shanyuan, a car driver in the Transportation Section of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League: I am a young car driver. When I saw Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" published in the "People's Daily" on May 13 and Shu Wu's exposé of "Some Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique," I felt extremely angry. Although I have a low level of education, I can understand the letter Hu Feng wrote to Shu Wu. The "People's Daily" also exposed the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique" on May 24, which further increased my anger. Obviously, Hu Feng is a thorough counter-revolutionary element, the most insidious and vicious enemy, and especially harmful to our young people. If the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is not eliminated, it will cause inestimable losses to the country. Therefore, in addition to supporting the revocation of all of Hu Feng's positions, we also ask the government to severely punish his counter-revolutionary crimes according to law. In his letter to the members of his anti-Party clique, Hu Feng also dreamed of "everything is for the cause, for a more distant future." Look! How insidious this is. In order to defend the great victories we have already achieved and will achieve, we must not let the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary clique "seek rebirth in suffering."
    Through the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incident, I realized that no matter what work position I am in, I must strengthen the study of political theory, always improve revolutionary vigilance, closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, and fight to thoroughly crush all the enemy's counter-revolutionary conspiracies.
    Letter from Han Bingsan, Planning Commission of Hunan Province: According to the materials revealed in the newspaper, Hu Feng had long been secretly carrying out anti-Party and counter-revolutionary conspiracies. The secret letters he wrote to his followers show that this reactionary clique has become a special detachment serving the reactionary ruling group on the cultural front.
    I think we must recognize the political face of Hu Feng and his clique in this way. Therefore, the Hu Feng issue is not only a problem of literary and art circles, but a problem of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, a problem that everyone should care about. I am an industrial planning worker. As a member of the patriotic people, I have the right to condemn Hu Feng, and every person who loves the motherland has this right. We should actively participate in this struggle and improve our understanding from this struggle.
    Letter from Peng Zaixing, Jiulong Township, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province: I am a young man in the countryside. After reading the two batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party clique, I recognized the true face of Hu Feng and his anti-Party clique. Judging from the materials exposing Hu Feng's crimes, Hu Feng has extreme hatred for the revolution, for the construction of the motherland, and for the vast number of working people. He has directly or indirectly spread a lot of reactionary bourgeois ideological toxins in the minds of many young intellectuals. The tricks he played were very clever. He was more cunning and insidious and more vicious in his methods than ordinary counter-revolutionaries. Hu Feng is an agent of imperialism and the bourgeoisie and reactionaries who have long been lurking in the revolutionary ranks.
    The eyes of the people are discerning, and Hu Feng's ugly face has been exposed. But we must thoroughly expose it. The truth of Marxism-Leninism cannot be distorted; socialist construction cannot be sabotaged; Chairman Mao's literary and art policies cannot be slandered. The crimes of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique are not small. The Hu Feng incident is no longer just a matter for literary and art circles, but something that the vast number of patriotic masses should jointly denounce. We young intellectuals should learn from the lessons of the Hu Feng incident and raise our vigilance! Under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will strengthen our studies, improve ourselves, and contribute our strength to the socialist construction of our great motherland in our respective positions.
    Hu Feng is our political mortal enemy
    Letters from Li Ke, Cao Zhongde, and Li Dechun, Chinese students studying in Moscow University in the Soviet Union, and Li Jingwen, a student studying in Moscow Economic Institute: The "People's Daily" published the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Clique." The more we Chinese students in Moscow read it, the more indignant we became, and the tighter we clenched our teeth.
    Hu Feng is more vicious than a jackal and more cunning than a fox. This poisonous snake has been persisting in anti-Party and anti-people conspiracies for twenty years, using all the despicable and insidious means of ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. This is intolerable to the people.
    Hu Feng praised Chairman Mao on the surface, but slandered Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a "totem" behind his back. Hu Feng praised the Communist Party on the surface, but slandered the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China as a "board of directors" behind his back. Hu Feng claimed to be a great disciple of Lu Xun, but cursed the commemoration of Lu Xun as a "disaster" behind his back. Hu Feng made "My Self-Criticism" on the surface, but reorganized his troops and arranged a retreat behind his back, hoping to make a comeback. What an insidious fellow. He inherited the mantle of Trotsky and Bukharin and used the method of "lizard changing color" to attack the Communist Party and the people. For many years, Hu Feng used publishing houses, magazines, and newspapers to poison our younger generation. Now, we have recognized his true face. Hu Feng is not only a villain and scum in the literary world, but also our political mortal enemy. In order to deceive readers, Hu Feng often quoted Belinsky. In fact, Hu Feng is more vicious than Bulgarin, the literary agent of the Tsarist government who Belinsky repeatedly attacked in the 1840s. In order to deceive readers, Hu Feng often mentioned the great Balzac. In fact, Hu Feng is more sordid than Lousteau, the Parisian literary and journalistic philistine described by Balzac in his novel "Lost Illusions." Until now, for the counter-revolutionary "greater future," Hu Feng is "willing to cut off" his head and "throw it out." What a stubborn enemy! We firmly support the resolution to expel Hu Feng from the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers Association. We firmly demand that Hu Feng's qualification as a deputy to the People's Congress be revoked. We young people are opponents of Hu Feng's bourgeois literature and supporters of socialist literature. Gorky, the founder of socialist literature, said: "If the enemy does not surrender, destroy him!"
    Letter from Cai Chengzhi and Su Hui, Revolutionary Disabled Workers in Shanghai: When the people of the whole country are working diligently to build socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the counter-revolutionary elements at home and abroad, in order to save their dying fate, are also frantically driving nails, sending scouts, and conspiring to sabotage our socialist construction. The exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary clique fully demonstrates the intensity and acuteness of the current class struggle.
    We are revolutionary disabled workers. In many years of revolutionary struggle, we have deeply realized that the glorious achievements of the motherland are due to the sacrifice and struggle of countless revolutionary martyrs and the blood and sweat of millions of working people. The counter-revolutionary Hu Feng clique has tried every possible means to sabotage the revolution; committed many anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes that benefited the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. This is something that every patriotic person hates and laments.
    Judging from the materials revealed by the "People's Daily" successively, are not the crimes of the Hu Feng reactionary clique the same as those of Trotsky and Bukharin in the Soviet Union in those years? Therefore, all parties and factions and patriotic people of all strata in our country must, in order to safeguard the cause of the Party and the people and to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, launch a major attack on this planned, organized, and programmed Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.
    Letter from all the creative staff of the Central Newsreel Film Studio: When the "People's Daily" exposed Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes, it aroused our great anger.
    The notoriously criminal counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng, in the face of irrefutable iron evidence, exposed his ugly face of being anti-Party and anti-people. Facts have proved that Hu Feng is not a "person who has made mistakes in ideological understanding," nor is he a "organizer of literary work standing around the Party," but an insidious, vicious, and political conspirator who does everything possible to destroy the revolution. For a long time, he used the guise of a Marxist literary theorist to deceive the Party and the people. Under this grand facade, he carried out his counter-revolutionary activities, attempting to subvert the revolution. Therefore, Hu Feng is the most cunning enemy. We must carry out a ruthless struggle against such a class enemy, and we will never stop until we achieve complete victory.
    We fully support and endorse the resolution made by the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on Hu Feng, and fully support Guo Moruo's proposal to deal with Hu Feng according to law. At the same time, we demand that the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique be further and resolutely and thoroughly investigated, and that the members of this reactionary clique thoroughly confess all their anti-Party and anti-people criminal activities. All Hu Feng members should be resolutely warned that no matter how cunningly you carry out your "retreat," no matter how you hide, you cannot conceal the eyes and ears of the people. Your only way out is to disarm and surrender to the Party and the people. (Attached picture)

专栏：

    坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    彻查胡风反革命集团的一切罪行
    中国人民志愿军战士陈若水来信：当我在远离祖国的朝鲜，看到了“人民日报”上登载的揭露胡风反党集团的材料时，更清楚地认识了胡风集团的极端反动性。自文艺界热烈地掀起了讨论和批判胡风问题以来，我也关心着祖国文艺战线上的胜利，那时我还认为，胡风只是思想上的问题。现在揭穿了，才知道二十多年来他是一直在马克思主义的外衣下向党进攻，想用卑劣的手段夺取党所领导的文艺战线，达到他反党、反人民、反革命的目的。
    我虽是一个志愿军战士，但是我很热爱文艺作品；它是我们部队中不可缺少的精神食粮，它鼓舞着我们的战斗意志。为了肃清文艺界中资产阶级反动思想的侵蚀，纯洁革命队伍，我们一切文艺工作者和全国人民，一定要坚决彻底地粉碎胡风反革命集团。
    广州军区政治部青年部柯源来信：我是一个革命军人。当我们从“人民日报” 上看到令人震骇的胡风反党反人民反革命集团的第一、二批材料，以及胡风那篇没有一句真话的“自我批判”后，我们感到万分的愤慨。我们认为：胡风反革命集团，是在一副居心叵测的“微笑”下，向我们背后投掷“集束手榴弹”的极其危险的暗害祖国的集团。
    对于胡风这样一个怙恶不悛的坚决反革命分子，我们完全拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主团席联席扩大会议的决议，撤销胡风在中国文联、中国作家协会和“人民文学”编辑部的各项职务，开除他的会籍。同时，希望迅速依法撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表资格，根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，严予惩治。
    胡风反革命集团的党羽是不少的，有些还是极其顽固的。我们警告胡风反革命集团分子，假使你们能够老老实实坦白，交出罪证，重新作人，你们还可以得到人民的宽大。假使你们仍然执迷不悟，死不回头，那就的确会像“苍蝇蚊子”一样，在人民的铜墙铁壁前碰得粉碎。人民的力量是强大的，人民是不可侮辱的，而人民的容忍也是有限度的。我们建议党、政府、军队领导机关和文学艺术团体，一定要胡风分子交出他们反革命集团的名单，对他们中间的每一个人，都要加以彻底的审查，搞清他们全部的罪恶活动。除了其中诚心诚意改悔并有实际表现者外，应一律从我们革命阵营的各种组织中清洗出去，并依法惩治。
    山东省历城中学孙茗梨来信：自从“人民日报”发表了舒芜的“关于胡风反党集团的一些材料”以后，我愤怒的感情再也不能抑制了，三番两次地想写信给“人民日报”，要声讨胡风集团的罪行。我的信件还未发出，又看到五月二十四日“人民日报”发表的“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”。这时我的心都要气炸了！胡风集团分子，他们所作所为，符合哪些人的利益呢？他们同国民党匪帮的文化特务又有什么区别呢？他们伪装进步，别有用心地混进了革命团体内部进行破坏。这是我们最危险的敌人。我认为：应立即依法撤销这个反党集团的首恶分子胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并认真地彻查他们还有什么“不能涉及的”的反革命活动，彻底打垮这个反动集团，以保持我们革命队伍的纯洁性和战斗性，保卫我们辛苦取得的胜利果实。
    河北省通县第九区何各庄田世昌来信：我是一个爱好文艺的农村青年。解放后的几年来，我从各种文艺著作中学了很多东西，得到了很多的知识和启发。因此我觉得我的头脑比以前丰富多了，开朗多了。我觉得文学家都是我的良师益友，因此我尊敬他们，热爱他们。前些天我在报上看到“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”后，我怎么也压不住内心的愤怒。胡风是人民的敌人，不配称为作家，不配让人尊重。
    因此我们要求党，要求政府赶快撤销胡风的一切职务，并且依法给以严厉的惩罚。
    对胡风集团内的其他毫无悔过之意，执迷不悟，拒不坦白者，也应当给以惩治。
    我想对敌人，对破坏今天社会主义建设的敌人，对破坏人民民主政权的敌人，我们是应该毫不容情的。
    中央重工业部保育院学习小组来信：先后看到揭发胡风反党反人民反革命的两批材料，引起我们小组人员无比的愤怒。胡风集团是有组织有计划地伪装进步混进革命阵营的最阴险的反革命集团。他用“集束手榴弹”的战法，“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，里外夹攻地破坏革命事业。明枪易躲，暗箭难防，胡风二十多年来披着马克思主义外衣，暗中干着反党反人民的勾当，真是恶毒无耻到了极点。我们感谢党的英明果断，及时地把这一罪恶集团揭露出来，教育了我们，引起了我们的警惕。我们建议有关部门把胡风反党集团的阴谋诡计彻底清算，肃清散布在青年中的毒素。我们是保育工作者，天天在教养我们祖国的花朵——新生一代，我们决不允许这一九尾狐狸混在我们的队伍里。
    广西省革命残废军人学校郑邦武来信：我热烈拥护开除胡风中国作家协会会籍的决议。胡风反革命集团不但是我们思想上的敌人，也是我们政治上的敌人。胡风曾披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，进行着反党反人民的活动，散布资产阶级唯心主义思想，敌视毛主席的文艺方针。他的作品毒害了许多青年读者，因此，我们必须从各个方面彻底清除胡风的反动思想影响。
    加强政治理论学习，提高革命警惕
    中苏友好协会总会工作人员廖经天、李沾吾等一百零二人来信：看了揭露胡风反革命集团的材料，我们感到万分愤怒。胡风集团原来并不只是一个在文艺思想上持反动观点的集团，而是一个不折不扣的反革命组织。他们有着反革命的纲领，有着严密的组织，有着一整套特务活动的手段。他们表面上拥护共产党，拥护革命，实际上却是如此地反对共产党，反对革命，反对人民。胡风反革命集团是如此狠毒地向我们进攻，我们就要坚决彻底地粉碎它，叫他们永远记住人民是不好欺负的。胡风集团的反革命罪行已是铁案如山，依法加以严惩是完全必要的。
    我们深刻地体会到，党所领导的粉碎胡风集团的斗争，对我们是一次非常具体的阶级斗争的教育。党屡次教导我们，在过渡时期，阶级斗争不但不会缓和，而且要更加复杂和尖锐。因此就必须经常保持高度的政治警惕性。我们再一次学习了这个真理。胡风集团能够欺骗住一些人，就是因为人们的理论水平、政治水平不高，给了他们欺骗的机会。因此我们必须加强思想上的武装，必须刻苦学习马克思列宁主义，学习辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。马克思列宁主义是最可靠的照妖镜，掌握了它，就能分辨出一切反动派的丑恶嘴脸。学习马克思列宁主义是提高我们政治觉悟和理论水平的最基本的方法，努力学习，就是增强我们对于敌对思想的抗毒素。
    我们一定要坚决彻底地粉碎胡风反革命集团。胡风反革命集团的一切分子，必须彻底坦白，听候人民处理。我们绝不容许他们“装死”，蒙混过关，隐蔽潜伏，而让他们能够继续危害革命事业。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会交通股汽车司机吴善元来信：我是一个青年汽车司机。当我看到五月十三日“人民日报”所刊载的胡风的“我的自我批判”和舒芜所揭发的“关于胡风反党集团的
  一些材料”，真使我感到无比的愤怒。我虽然文化低，但是我可以看懂胡风写给舒芜的信。五月二十四日“人民日报”又揭发了“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”，更增加了我的愤怒。很明显，胡风就是一个彻头彻尾的反革命分子，是最阴险最毒辣的敌人，特别是对我们青年的害处更大。要是不消灭胡风反革命集团，对国家就能造成不可估计的损失。所以，我们除了拥护撤销胡风的一切职务外，还要求政府依法严厉处理他的反革命罪行。胡风在写给他的反党集团分子的信中，还梦想着“一切都是为了事业，为了更远大的未来”。看！这是多么阴险。为了保卫我们已经取得的和将要取得的伟大胜利，我们决不能叫胡风反党反人民反革命集团
  “在忍受中求得重生”。
    通过胡风反革命的事件，使我认识到，不管在任何一个工作岗位上，都要加强政治理论学习，时刻提高革命警惕性，紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，为彻底粉碎敌人的一切反革命阴谋而斗争。
    湖南省计划委员会韩秉三来信：从报纸所揭露的材料来看，胡风早就暗地进行反党，反革命的阴谋活动了。他给他的党羽们写的密信，说明了这个反动集团已经是在文化战线上为反动统治集团服务的一支别动队。
    我认为我们必须这样来认识胡风及其集团的政治面目。因此，胡风集团的问题不仅仅是文艺界的问题，而是革命和反革命的斗争问题，是每一个人都应该关心的问题。我是一个工业计划工作人员，作为爱国人民的一分子，我有权利来谴责胡风，每一个热爱祖国的人都有这个权利。我们应该积极参加这一斗争，从这个斗争中提高我们的认识。
    四川省江津县九龙乡彭再兴来信：我是农村中的一个青年。读了揭发胡风反党集团的两批材料之后，使我认清了胡风及其反党集团的真面目。从揭发胡风罪恶的材料看来，胡风对革命、对祖国建设、对广大的劳动人民是有极大的仇恨的，他在很多青年知识分子的思想中，直接或间接地传播了不少反动的资产阶级思想毒素。他玩弄的花样非常巧妙，他比一般的反革命分子更狡猾更阴险，手段更毒辣。胡风是帝国主义及资产阶级和反动派长期潜伏在革命队伍中的代理人。
    人民的眼睛是雪亮的，胡风的丑恶面目已经揭露出来了。但是我们还要彻底揭发。马克思列宁主义的真理不容歪曲；社会主义建设不容破坏；毛主席的文艺方针不容诋毁。胡风及其反革命集团的罪恶是不小的，胡风事件已不只是文艺界的事了，而是广大的爱国群众应该共起声讨的。我们知识青年应该通过胡风事件的教训，提高警惕！在党和毛主席正确的领导下，加强学习，提高自己，在伟大祖国社会主义建设的各自岗位上贡献出自己的力量。
    胡风是我们政治上的死敌
    我国在苏联莫斯科大学的留学生李克、曹忠德、李得春和莫斯科经济学院留学生李京文来信：“人民日报”发表了“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”，我们几个在莫斯科的中国留学生愈看愈愤恨，愈看牙齿咬得愈紧。
    胡风比豺狼凶恶，比狐狸奸猾。他这条毒蛇二十年来一直坚持反党反人民的阴谋勾当，使尽了古今中外卑鄙和阴险的手段，这是人们不能容忍的。
    胡风表面上歌颂毛主席，背后却污蔑毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”为“图腾”。胡风表面上称赞共产党，背后污蔑中共中央为“董事会”。胡风自命为鲁迅的大弟子，背后骂纪念鲁迅为“灾难”。胡风表面上作“我的自我批判”，背后却整顿兵马，布置退却，以期卷土重来。好阴险的家伙。他承继了托洛茨基、布哈林的衣钵，利用“蜥蜴变色”的手法进攻共产党和人民。多少年来，胡风利用出版社、杂志、报纸毒害我们青年一代。现在，我们认清了他的真面目。胡风不仅仅是文坛上的恶棍和败类，而且是我们政治上的死敌。为了欺骗读者，胡风经常引证别林斯基，其实胡风比别林斯基在十九世纪四十年代所屡加攻击的沙皇政府文学特务布尔加林更为恶毒。为了欺骗读者，胡风经常提到伟大的巴尔扎克，其实胡风比巴尔扎克在小说“幻灭”中所描写的巴黎文学和新闻市侩路士托更加龌龊。直到现在，为了反革命的“更远大的未来”，胡风“愿意割下”头颅“抛掷出去”。多么顽固的敌人！我们坚决拥护开除胡风出中国文联和中国作家协会的决议。我们坚决要求撤销胡风的人民代表大会代表的资格。我们青年人是胡风资产阶级文学的反对者，是社会主义文学的拥护者。社会主义文学的奠基人高尔基说过：“如果敌人不投降，就消灭他！”
    上海市革命残废工作人员蔡成之、苏辉来信：当全国人民正在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，兢兢业业地建设社会主义的时候，国内外的反革命分子，为了挽救自己垂死的命运，也就猖狂地打钉子、派坐探，阴谋破坏我们的社会主义建设。胡风反党、反人民、反革命集团的被揭露，充分说明了目前阶级斗争的激烈和尖锐。
    我们是革命残废工作人员，在多年革命斗争中，深切地体会到祖国的辉煌成就是由于无数革命先烈的牺牲奋斗和千百万劳动人民的流血流汗换来的。而反革命的胡风集团却千方百计地来破坏革命；做出许多反党、反人民、反革命的有利于蒋介石匪帮的种种罪行，这是我们每个爱国人民所万分恨痛的。
    从“人民日报”先后所揭露的材料看，胡风反动集团的罪恶，不是和苏联当年的托洛茨基、布哈林一样吗？因此我们全国各党各派和各阶层的爱国人民，为了维护党与人民事业，为了保卫祖国的社会主义建设，必须对这个有计划、有组织、有纲领的胡风反革命集团大张挞伐。
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂全体创作人员来信：当“人民日报”揭露了关于胡风反党、反人民、反革命的罪行以后，激起了我们极大的愤怒。
    罪恶昭彰的反革命分子胡风，在无可辩驳的铁证面前，暴露了他反党、反人民的丑恶面目。事实证明，胡风并不是什么“在思想认识上犯了错误的人”，更不是什么“站在党底周围的文学工作的组织者”，而是一个阴险、毒辣、对革命的破坏无所不用其极的政治阴谋家。他长期用马克思主义文艺理论家的招牌，欺骗党和人民，就在这个冠冕堂皇的幌子下，进行着他的反革命的活动，企图颠覆革命，因此，胡风是一个最狡猾的敌人。对这样的阶级敌人，必须进行无情的斗争，不达到彻底的胜利，决不收兵。
    我们完全拥护和支持中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议对胡风所作的决议，完全拥护郭沫若所提出的依法处理胡风的建议。同时，我们要求进一步坚决、彻底地追查胡风反革命集团的罪行，要这一反动集团的分子，把他们反党、反人民的一切罪恶活动作彻底的交代。应当坚决警告所有的胡风分子们，不管你们施展多么狡猾的“退却”，不管你们如何隐蔽，都不能遮掩住人民的耳目，你们唯一的出路，就是向党、向人民缴械投降。（附图片）
