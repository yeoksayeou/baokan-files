Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 9th: According to the "Worker Daily" report, some social groups in the United States are recently calling for the easing of international tensions.

    The "National Congress of Parents and Teachers," with 9.5 million members, held a national convention with 3,000 participants in Chicago at the end of May. Leonard, the chairman of this organization, called on American students' parents and teachers at the meeting to step up their efforts to strive for easing international tensions. Leonard said that our responsibility is to establish a solid and lasting peace, and we should insist that American diplomats sit down and negotiate unresolved international issues. Leonard emphasized that the "National Congress of Parents and Teachers" should take the initiative in every social unit to promote peace activities, so that every American family, school, and social group becomes an integral part of the common effort to strive for peace.
    The Congregational Christian Churches of the United States, with organizations in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, held a meeting at the end of May. The resolution passed at the meeting expressed concern about the threat of atomic war and called for the reduction of conventional armaments by all countries.
    The signature campaign launched by the American Labor Party to demand a summit conference of major powers to resolve international disputes is currently continuing. Those responsible for collecting signatures for the Labor Party said that a few years ago, many Americans were afraid of signing peace petitions, and even of accepting pamphlets advocating peace. This situation has now changed, and the Labor Party's signature campaign has received almost 100% favorable responses in some places.

    美国社会团体要求缓和国际紧张局势
    新华社九日讯　纽约消息：据“工人日报”报道，美国有一些社会团体正在最近提出要求缓和国际紧张局势。
    拥有九百五十万会员的“全国家长与教师大会”五月底在芝加哥举行了一次有三千人参加的全国代表大会。这个组织的主席伦纳德在会上号召美国学生的家长们和教师们加紧为争取缓和国际紧张局势而努力。伦纳德说，我们的责任是建立巩固而持久的和平，我们应该坚持要求美国的外交家坐下来就悬而未决的国际问题进行谈判。伦纳德强调“全国家长与教师大会”应该在每一个社会单位中采取主动来促进和平活动，以便使美国每一个家庭、学校、和社会团体都变成争取和平的共同努力中的组成部分。
    美国教会组织公理会在新泽西州、特拉华州、马里兰州、弗吉尼亚州和哥伦比亚特区的组织，五月底举行了一次会议。会议通过的决议对原子战争的威胁表示忧虑，并且要求裁减各国常规军备。
    美国劳工党发动的要求举行大国高级会议解决国际纠纷的签名运动目前正在继续展开。劳工党负责征集签名的人说，在几年前，许多美国人对于和平签名，甚至对于接受一些主张和平的小册子，都感到害怕，现在这种情况有了转变，劳工党的签名运动在某些地方差不多得到了百分之百有利的响应。
