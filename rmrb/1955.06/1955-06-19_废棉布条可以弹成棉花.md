    The employees of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company in Jinan City use waste cotton cloth strips to make cotton wadding, saving the country a large amount of raw cotton.
    In February of this year, the employees of the raw cotton section of this company entrusted a private cotton ginning factory to gin the scrap cloth strips cut from the processing of cotton cloth eight times using a cotton ginning machine. The cotton wadding produced was of good color and cotton lint, and could be used to spin 10-count yarn. In April, they used more than 30,000 jin of waste cloth strips purchased from clothing factories to produce 15,000 jin of cotton wadding, and planned to produce another 15,000 jin of cotton wadding in May. After these 30,000 jin of cotton wadding are produced, they can replace the raw cotton used for cotton wadding and supply it to yarn mills for spinning. This company plans to turn all the scrap cloth strips left over from processing cotton cloth into cotton wadding in the future.

    废棉布条可以弹成棉花
    中国花纱布公司济南市公司的职工利用废棉布条弹成棉花，为国家节省大量原棉。
    今年二月份，这个公司原棉科的职工把加工棉布裁下来的碎布条，委托私营弹花厂用弹花机弹了八遍，弹出的棉花色泽、棉绒都相当好，可供纺十支纱用。四月份他们又用从被服厂收购来的三万多斤废布条弹出一万五千斤棉花，并计划在五月份再弹出一万五千斤棉花。这三万斤棉花弹出以后，可替换出作棉絮用的原棉供应纱厂纺纱。这个公司计划今后把加工棉布剩下的碎布条全部弹成棉花。
