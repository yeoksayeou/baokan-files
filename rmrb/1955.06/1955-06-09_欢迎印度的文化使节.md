    Welcome the Cultural Envoys of India
    Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of Culture, People's Republic of China

    From the northern mountains capped with snow year-round to Cape Comorin where the turquoise waves crash against the weathered cliffs; from the western gateway of Elephanta Island and the Seven Pagodas, to the eastern economic and cultural hub of Calcutta, the diverse songs and dances of the people have sprung from the ever-changing climate and colorful land. These rich and varied musical and dance forms, passed down since the dawn of human memory, constitute the radiant essence of Indian culture and art. These musical and dance forms possess healthy and beautiful content and forms and are constantly being discovered—just as Chinese folk music and dance are constantly being discovered. Who knows how many excellent musical and dance forms are still hidden in remote corners, circulating only among a few people, but once discovered, they receive the attention of the masses and are promoted and popularized.

    I heard the "Nightingale of South India" sing in Madras. It was a special performance for our Chinese cultural delegation. We couldn’t understand a single lyric, but we felt the greatest joy and admiration from the singer's expression and voice. One moment her voice soared to the clouds, sharp as tearing silk, the next she descended from the highest point, gradually transitioning into a drawn-out and lingering melody. The strength, the richness, and the excellence of her voice, with two or three minutes of vocalization and modulation, were truly admirable. In terms of dance, we witnessed even more grand and wonderful scenes, where Indian artists demonstrated outstanding creative abilities.

    We traveled through India for a month and a half, covering the "Five Indies," and met many musicians, dancers, writers, film directors and actors, and playwrights in major Indian cities. On the one hand, we performed Chinese dramas, music, and dance, and on the other hand, we actively learned Indian music and dance. Thanks to the warm and dedicated instruction of Indian artists, our learning achieved some success. This is a concrete manifestation of cultural exchange between China and India.

    Now, the Indian Cultural Delegation has come to China for a "return visit." The head of the delegation, Mr. Chand, is very familiar to us. He hosted our welcome when we arrived in Delhi and our farewell when we left Calcutta. Many of the delegation members are friends we became acquainted with in various parts of India. When we excitedly welcomed them, seeing familiar faces, we couldn't help but reveal the joy of a long-awaited reunion.

    We believe that this visit and performance by the Indian Cultural Delegation will greatly inspire artists across China. With their rich and diverse, profound and exquisite art, they will bring great joy and admiration to the broad masses of the Chinese people.

    Through this visit and performance by the Indian Cultural Delegation, we can say with certainty that it will strengthen the cause of cultural exchange between China and India, thereby further promoting the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of China and India. And what a tremendous force the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of China and India will be in safeguarding peace in Asia and the world!

    We welcome the cultural envoys from India with excitement and enthusiasm; we wish them a successful performance!

    Long live China-India cultural exchange!
    Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and India!

    欢迎印度的文化使节
    中华人民共和国文化部副部长　郑振铎
    从终年戴着白雪的尖帽的北部山地到碧波一阵阵的碰碎在苍岩下的柯摩林海角；从西方的门户象岛和七星塔，到东方的经济，文化的重镇加尔各答，在千变万化的气候和千红万紫的土地上，产生出来多种多样的人民的歌和舞。这些丰富多采的、从人类有记忆之日起就流传下来的音乐和舞蹈，构成了印度的文化、艺术里光芒万丈的精英。这些音乐和舞蹈具有健康而美丽的内容和形式，还正在不断地被发现中，——正像中国的民间音乐、舞蹈正在不断地被发现中一样；不知道有多少优秀的音乐、舞蹈还隐藏在山涯海角里，仅仅流传于少数的人民之间，但一旦被发现了之后就受到广大群众的注意而加以宣传和推广。
    我在马特拉斯听过“南印度的夜莺”的歌唱，那是特地为我们中国文化代表团举行的一次歌唱，我们听不懂一句歌词，但从那位大歌唱家的表情和歌声里感到最大的喜悦和赞赏。她一会儿高唱入云，音若裂帛，一会儿从最高处转折而下，逐渐的转入曼长而袅袅不绝的调子中，足足有两三分钟的运腔转调，那力量的厚重，歌喉的卓越，令人赞赏不已。在舞蹈方面，我们所见到的弘伟和精彩的场面更多，在那里，印度的艺术家们表现了十分优秀的创作能力。
    我们在印度游历了一个半月，跑遍了“五印度”，结识了印度各大城市中的许多音乐家们、舞蹈家们、作家们、电影导演和演员们、戏剧家们。一方面表演中国的戏剧、音乐和舞蹈，同时，也在积极地学习印度的音乐和舞蹈。由于印度艺术家们的热忱的专心一志的教导，我们的学习获得了若干成就。这是中国和印度两国之间的文化交流的一个具体的表现。
    现在，印度文化代表团到中国来“报聘”了。代表团的团长钱达先生，和我们是很熟悉的，我们到达德里，和离开加尔各答时，都是他主持迎送；许多团员们也都是我们在印度各地就熟悉了的朋友们。当我们带着兴奋欢迎他们的时候，看到一张张熟悉的脸孔，彼此不自禁的都会流露出久别重逢的喜悦。
    我们相信，印度文化代表团这次的访问演出，将会给中国各地的艺术家们以很大的鼓舞。他们将会以其丰富多采，深厚精湛的艺术，给予中国广大人民以很大的喜悦和赞赏。
    通过这次印度文化代表团的访问演出，我们可以肯定地说，必会加强中国和印度两国之间的文化交流事业，从而更加推进中国和印度两国人民之间的友谊和合作，而中国和印度两国人民之间的友谊和合作将是如何巨大的保卫亚洲和世界和平的力量啊！
    我们以兴奋而热烈的心情来欢迎从印度远道而来的文化使节；我们预祝他们的演出的成功！
    中国、印度文化交流万岁！
    中国、印度两国人民的友好万岁！
