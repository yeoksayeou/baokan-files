Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: The National Conference on Cultural and Educational Work, which opened on May 19th, victoriously concluded today.

Through this conference, all representatives clarified the basic guidelines and policies for current cultural and educational work. They further revised the cultural and educational section of the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy in accordance with the new guidelines and policies. They also focused on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), conducting an in-depth ideological critique of certain leaders of the Ministry of Health.

The conference believes that, based on the overall task of the country during the transition period and the basic tasks stipulated in the draft of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, and in conjunction with the situation of cultural and educational work, the current focus of all cultural and educational work should be on improving quality, developing steadily with a plan and focus. At the same time, the principle of rational deployment and overall planning should be implemented so that cultural and educational undertakings can more effectively serve economic construction, national defense construction, and the improvement of the people's cultural life.

This conference focused on discussing the issue of improving the quality of higher education. The conference believes that great achievements have been made in training cadres in the past, but there was a one-sided emphasis on the need for quantity, without seriously paying attention to ensuring quality. In the future, higher education should focus on improving teaching and raising and ensuring quality. While ensuring quality, efforts should be made to strive for the quantity of cadres trained. To this end, the formulation of enrollment plans in the future should take into account quantity requirements on the premise of ensuring quality. Students admitted to universities and colleges must be politically reliable, physically healthy enough to persevere in their studies, and academically able to keep up with the class. Universities and colleges should vigorously admit young worker-peasant cadres and children of workers and peasants. Young cadres from government organs should be allowed to apply, but the admission requirements should not be lowered as a result. Regarding the length of schooling in universities and colleges, the conference believes that in the past few years, it was necessary to adopt the policy of focusing on developing short-term training programs in order to train a large number of cadres, but students graduating from these programs are not up to the level of a high-level construction talent. Therefore, these programs should be discontinued as soon as possible, except for those that are necessary. In the future, the task of training such talents should be solved by vigorously running secondary technical schools. The conference believes that the current higher industrial schools in our country have basically adopted the Soviet five-year teaching plan, but the study period is only four years, which increases the burden on students and makes it difficult for them to learn well. Therefore, it is necessary for higher industrial schools to gradually change from a four-year system to a five-year system. The length of schooling in other schools such as comprehensive universities and higher agricultural, forestry, finance, economics, political science, law, medicine, teacher training, and art schools should also be appropriately changed according to different circumstances and with reference to Soviet experience, with distinctions and steadily. The conference believes that the most important aspect of ensuring quality is the improvement of the quality of teaching work. In the future, attention must be paid to implementing the educational policy of all-round development, and special attention should be paid to strengthening the theoretical education and political and ideological education of Marxism-Leninism; the school's production internship and experimental work should be strengthened; the excessive academic burden on students should be reduced; sports and recreational activities in schools should be actively carried out, and food management should be improved to improve the health of teachers and students. In order to improve teaching, teaching plans should also be correctly revised and teaching syllabuses should be modified; the school's teaching organization and teaching methods should be improved; and scientific research work should be strengthened. The conference believes that the key to improving teaching work is to vigorously cultivate and improve the teaching staff. In this regard, the strength of Soviet experts and the role of veteran teachers should be fully and rationally utilized. The conference especially pointed out that it is a very important method of training cadres to use correspondence courses or evening universities to absorb on-the-job learning by cadres, technicians, and skilled workers from industrial and mining enterprises. The Higher Education Department should cooperate with various business departments to run various part-time technical schools and be responsible for leading, rectifying, and improving the quality of various types of secondary technical schools.

The conference believes that concrete measures should also be taken in general education, culture, and health undertakings to strive to improve quality. In terms of general education, in the future, the educational policy of all-round development should be further implemented, school leaders and teachers should be improved in a planned way, and editing and revising primary and secondary school teaching materials should be taken as one of the central tasks. In order to meet the needs of the country to train high-level construction talents, high schools should also be vigorously developed and run well according to needs and possibilities.

The conference emphasized that the cultural education of workers, peasants, and worker-peasant cadres should be vigorously carried out, but the policy of focusing on spare-time study must be resolutely implemented. A large number of regular spare-time worker-peasant schools from primary school to university should be established. Full guarantees must be given in terms of teachers, time, funding, and leadership. A large number of worker-peasant children should be admitted to ordinary middle schools. The cultural education of cadres should be strengthened. The existing worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools, although they have made great efforts in the past, have difficulties that are difficult to overcome in various aspects due to the method of allowing the backbone of industrial workers and worker-peasant cadres to leave their jobs for a long time to study and to undergo short-term accelerated training. Therefore, enrollment should be stopped from this year. The existing worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools must continue to be run well, and the length of schooling should be extended by one year; some of the worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools with conditions can recruit worker-peasant cadre classes and gradually be converted into ordinary middle schools.

The conference also pointed out that in the future, all levels of schools should continue to overcome the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic, strictly enforce learning discipline, strictly implement the reward and punishment system, and resolutely oppose certain illegal and undisciplined behaviors.

Regarding the issue of improving the quality of cultural work, the conference believes that concrete steps should be taken in the future to effectively organize forces, develop literary and artistic creation, strengthen artistic practice, better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and gradually improve the quality of artistic creation. This improvement should be based on popularization and should not start from the preferences of a few people; attention must be paid to both ideological and artistic qualities, and technical skills should not be emphasized one-sidedly, while neglecting politics. The conference pointed out that vigorously promoting the policy of enterprise management of art undertakings is an important step to develop creation and artistic practice, improve quality, and cultivate talents, and must be resolutely implemented.

Regarding improving the quality of health work, the conference believes that the ideological education of medical personnel should be done well first, the sense of responsibility of medical personnel should be strengthened, medical efficiency should be improved, and medical accidents should be reduced or eliminated as much as possible. The patriotic health campaign should continue to be carried out under leadership. The prevention and control of various endemic diseases and parasitic diseases should be vigorously strengthened. Special attention should be paid to implementing the Party Central Committee's policy on uniting Chinese and Western medicine, conscientiously strengthening the work of researching and developing traditional Chinese medicine, and thoroughly correcting the wrong ideas and practices toward traditional Chinese medicine. Grassroots health institutions should be effectively rectified.

The conference pointed out that improving quality should be gradually improved on the original basis, and should not be required to be too high or too urgent, but there should be a minimum limit; attention should be paid to the imbalance of objective conditions, and uniformity should not be forced; attention should be paid to cultivating key units so that key units can play a leading and exemplary role, and general units should make creative efforts according to their own conditions.

The conference discussed the issue of rational deployment and believed that in the past, the plans for cultural and educational undertakings accommodated the existing foundation more in terms of regional arrangement and development speed, and the overall planning was insufficient. Too much financial and human resources were allocated to culturally developed areas, and too little to culturally underdeveloped areas. The conference pointed out that in the future, the development of national cultural and educational undertakings should be rearranged according to the distribution and development speed of the national economy—especially industry. The speed of cultural development in the Northwest, Southwest, and general minority areas and old liberated areas should be appropriately increased in a planned manner.

Regarding the overall planning of public and private cultural and educational undertakings, the conference believes that in the future, the plans of government cultural and educational departments should include the plans of cultural and educational undertakings in industrial and mining enterprises and implement varying degrees of unified leadership over cultural and educational undertakings in industrial and mining enterprises according to different circumstances. Industrial and mining enterprises must also actively cooperate with government cultural and educational departments and shoulder the responsibilities they should bear. Regarding the grassroots cultural education and health undertakings run by the masses themselves in cities and rural areas, as long as they are indeed voluntary by the masses, the masses raise funds themselves, and there are necessary manpower, the masses should be allowed to run them themselves, and government cultural education departments should strengthen their leadership and assistance. The conference also affirmed that joint clinics are social welfare undertakings of a cooperative nature voluntarily organized by independent mental workers in the medical profession. In the future, joint clinics should be developed in a planned, steady, and well-led way, and existing joint clinics should be rectified. For existing private middle and primary schools, a policy of rectification and quality improvement should be adopted according to the circumstances. Private cultural supplementary schools should be rectified and strengthened in management according to the circumstances. For existing privately run cultural undertakings and cultural enterprises, they should be actively led, managed, utilized, and transformed. Private hospitals should generally be regarded as social welfare undertakings independently or jointly operated by independent mental workers in the medical profession. Private practicing doctors should be actively led, helped to solve specific difficulties, and their role should be fully utilized.

The conference discussed ideological criticism in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The conference believes that it is extremely necessary for all cultural and educational workers to criticize bourgeois idealism. It is not only an effective method to promote scientific and cultural progress, but also an important key to improving and raising the level of cultural and educational work. The conference pointed out that Dewey's reactionary pragmatism still has a considerable influence in today's school education. Correct steps must be taken to systematically and thoroughly criticize Dewey's reactionary educational ideology in connection with the reality of current educational work and eliminate its residual influence in schools at all levels.

The conference also criticized the bourgeois ideas of certain leaders of the Ministry of Health who discriminated against and eliminated traditional Chinese medicine, pointing out that the Ministry of Health had adopted wrong policies on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine in recent years, which was an extremely serious directional error in the work of the health department.

The conference also reviewed the subjectivism, bureaucracy, and decentralism that existed in the leadership work of cultural and educational departments. The conference believes that these shortcomings must be overcome, investigation and research and inspection work must be strengthened, the revolutionary sense of responsibility of staff must be strengthened, the study of theory and policy must be strengthened, the method of the mass line and the style of mass work must be adhered to, strict obedience to the leadership of the Party and the government must be maintained, organization and discipline must be strengthened, and bourgeois individualism and complacency must be resolutely overcome in order to improve the level of leadership work. The conference also pointed out that in improving their own leadership work, all cultural and educational departments must also pay attention to uniting and improving the cultural and educational team. Communist Party members in cultural and educational departments should be modest and cautious, and use exemplary actions and reasoning to help everyone improve politically and ideologically; non-Party intellectuals should also further learn Marxism-Leninism with the attitude of masters, criticize bourgeois ideas, improve their awareness, and actively strengthen the unity of the cultural and educational team; everyone should work diligently and conscientiously, overcome difficulties, practice thrift, and strive to complete the glorious tasks given by the Party and the state.

Finally, Lin Feng, Director of the Second Office of the State Council, made a summary of the conference.

During the conference, Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi and Director of the First Office of the State Council Luo Ruiqing made important reports to the conference; the representatives also listened to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on comprehensively increasing production and practicing economy. All the representatives held heated discussions on the above reports and instructions, unanimously expressed their support, and were determined to implement the spirit of the conference into all practical work.

    全国文化教育工作会议闭幕
    新华社十日讯　全国文化教育工作会议自五月十九日举行，已在今日胜利闭幕。
    经过这次会议，全体代表明确了当前文教工作的基本方针和政策，按照新的方针、政策进一步修订了发展国民经济第一个五年计划草案中的文化教育部分，并以中医问题为中心，重点深入地开展了对卫生部某些领导人的思想批判。
    会议认为，根据国家在过渡时期的总任务和发展国民经济第一个五年计划草案规定的基本任务，结合文教工作情况，当前各项文教工作都应以提高质量为重点，有计划、有重点地稳步发展，同时贯彻合理部署和统筹安排的方针，使文教事业更有效地为经济建设、国防建设和提高人民文化生活水平服务。
    这次会议着重讨论了提高高等教育质量的问题。会议认为过去在培养干部方面是有很大成绩的；但曾片面地强调数量方面的需要，没有认真注意保证质量。今后高等教育应以改进教学，提高与保证质量为中心任务。在保证质量的条件下，努力争取培养干部的数量。为此，今后制定招生计划应在保证质量的前提下，照顾数量要求。高等学校录取学生必须政治上可靠，身体健康能坚持学习，学业能跟上班。高等学校应大力吸收工农青年干部和工农子女入学，允许机关青年干部投考，但入学条件不能因此降低。关于高等学校的学制，会议认为过去几年为了大量培养干部，采取着重发展短期训练的专修科的方针，在一定条件下是必要的，但专修科毕业的学生不够一个高级建设人材的水平，因而专修科除必要者外应早日停办。今后培养此类人材的任务应用大力办好中等技术学校的办法来解决。会议认为，现在我国高等工业学校基本上采用了苏联五年制的教学计划，但学习年限却是四年，这就使学生负担加重，而且学不好；因此高等工业学校有必要逐步由四年制改为五年制。其它如综合大学和高等农林、财经、政法、医药、师范、艺术等学校的学制也应根据不同情况，参考苏联经验，有区别地和稳步地适当改变。会议认为，确保质量最主要的一环是教学工作质量的提高，今后必须注意贯彻全面发展的教育方针，特别应注意加强马克思列宁主义的理论教育和政治思想教育；应加强学校的生产实习和实验工作；应减轻学生过重的课业负担；要积极开展学校的体育、文娱活动，并改进伙食管理，增进师生健康。为了改进教学，还应正确地改订教学计划和修改教学大纲；改善学校的教学组织和教学方法；加强科学研究工作。会议认为改进教学工作的关键是大力培养和提高师资。在这一方面应充分合理地发挥苏联专家的力量和老教师的作用。会议特别指出，用函授或举办夜大学等办法吸收工矿干部、技术人员和熟练工人进行在职学习，是一项极其重要的培养干部的方法。高等教育部应和各业务部门配合，举办各种业余的技术学校，并对各类中等技术学校负责地加以领导，认真整顿，提高质量。
    会议认为在普通教育、文化、卫生事业方面也都应采取具体措施，努力提高质量。在普通教育方面，今后应进一步贯彻全面发展的教育方针，有计划地提高学校领导干部和教师，并把编辑和修改中、小学教材作为中心任务之一。为了适应国家培养高级建设人材的需要，还应根据需要和可能大力发展和办好高中。
    会议强调指出，工农群众和工农干部的文化教育应大力进行，但必须坚决贯彻业余学习为主的方针。大量举办正规的从小学到大学的业余工农学校。在师资、时间、经费和领导四个方面，均须给以充分的保证。在普通中学大量吸收工农子女入学。加强干部文化教育。现有的工农速成中学，过去虽作了很大努力，但这种使产业工人中的骨干和工农干部，大量长期离职学习和短期速成的办法在各方面有难于克服的困难，因此从今年起应即停止招生。对现有工农速成中学必须继续办好，学制延长一年；其中一部分有条件的工农速成中学可以招工农干部班，并逐步改为普通中学。
    会议还指出，今后各级学校都应继续克服忙乱现象，严肃学习纪律，严格执行奖惩制度，坚决反对某些违法乱纪行为。
    关于提高文化工作的质量问题，会议认为今后应采取具体步骤，切实组织力量，发展文艺创作，加强艺术实践，更好地为工农兵服务，并逐步提高艺术创作的质量。这种提高应以普及为基础，不能从少数人偏爱出发；必须同时注意思想性和艺术性，不能片面强调技术，忽视政治。会议指出，大力推行艺术事业企业化的方针，是发展创作和艺术实践、提高质量、培养人材的重要步骤，必须坚决贯彻。
    关于提高卫生工作的质量，会议认为首先应作好对医务人员的思想教育工作，加强医务人员的责任心，提高医疗效率，尽力减少以至消灭医疗责任事故。应继续有领导地开展爱国卫生运动。大力加强对于各种地方病与寄生虫病的防治工作。应特别注意贯彻党中央关于团结中西医的政策，认真加强研究和发扬祖国医学的工作，彻底纠正对待中医的错误思想和作法。基层卫生机构，应切实加以整顿。
    会议指出，提高质量应在原有基础上逐步提高，不能要求过高过急，但应有一个最低限度；应注意客观条件的不平衡性，不应强求一律；应注意培养重点单位，使重点单位起带头示范的作用，一般单位应就自己的条件，作创造性的努力。
    会议讨论了合理部署问题，认为过去文教事业计划，在地区安排和发展速度上较多地迁就了现有基础，通盘筹划不够。在财力、人力分配上文化发达的地方分得过多，文化不发达的地方分得过少。会议指出，今后全国文教事业的发展，应按照国民经济——特别是工业的分布和发展速度，作新的安排。西北、西南以及一般少数民族地区和老解放区的文化发展速度，应有计划地适当地提高。
    关于公私文教事业的统筹安排，会议认为今后政府文教部门的事业计划应包括工矿的文教事业计划，并根据不同情况，对工矿文教事业实行程度不同的统一领导。工矿企业部门也必须与政府文教部门主动配合，担当起应负的责任。关于城市和农村群众自己举办的基层文教、卫生事业，只要确实出于群众自愿，群众自己筹款，并有必要的人力，就应允许群众自办，政府文教部门应加强对它们的领导和帮助。会议还肯定：联合诊所是由独立脑力劳动的医务人员自愿组织起来的合作社性质的社会福利事业。今后联合诊所应有领导、有计划、稳步地发展，现有的联合诊所应加以整顿。对现有私立中、小学，应分别情况，采取整顿、提高质量的方针。对私立文化补习学校应根据情况分别进行整顿，加强管理。对现有的私人举办的文化事业和文化企业，应积极加以领导、管理、利用和改造。对于私人医院，一般地应视为独立脑力劳动的医务人员独立或联合经营的社会福利事业。对私人开业的医生，应积极加以领导，帮助解决具体困难，充分发挥他们的作用。
    会议以批评和自我批评的精神讨论了思想批判问题。会议认为，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想对全体文教工作者，极为必要。它不仅是推动科学和文化进步的有效方法，而且是改进和提高文教工作的重要关键。会议指出，杜威的实用主义反动思想在今天的学校教育中还有相当浓厚的影响，必须采取正确的步骤，联系当前教育工作的实际，对杜威派的反动教育思想作系统的和彻底的批判，清除其在各级学校中的残余影响。
    会议还批判了卫生部某些领导人歧视和消灭中医的资产阶级思想，指出几年来卫生部对中医问题采取了错误的政策，是卫生部门工作中一项极为严重的方针性的错误。
    会议还检查了文教部门领导工作中存在的主观主义、官僚主义、分散主义。会议认为，必须克服这些缺点，加强调查研究和检查工作，加强工作人员的革命责任心，加强理论和政策学习，坚持群众路线的方法和群众工作的作风，严格服从党和政府的领导，加强组织性、纪律性，坚决克服资产阶级个人主义和骄傲自满情绪，以提高领导工作的水平。会议还指出，各文教部门在改进自己领导工作中，还必须注意团结和提高文教队伍。文教部门的共产党员应谦虚谨慎，以模范行动和说理精神来帮助大家在政治上思想上提高；非党知识分子也应进一步以主人翁态度，认真学习马克思列宁主义，批判资产阶级思想，提高觉悟，并主动地加强文教队伍的团结；大家都兢兢业业，努力工作，克服困难，厉行节约，为完成党和国家给予的光荣任务而奋斗。
    会议最后由国务院第二办公室主任林枫作了总结。
    会议期间，国务院副总理陈毅、国务院第一办公室主任罗瑞卿曾到会作了重要报告；代表们并听取了中共中央关于全面增产节约的指示。全体代表就上述报告和指示进行了热烈的讨论，一致表示拥护，并决心把会议的精神贯彻到各项实际工作中去。
