Farmers in the cotton-producing areas of Jiangxi Province have sown more than 577,000 mu of fine-staple cotton. Currently, the cotton seedlings are generally growing well. The early-sown seedlings are already six or seven inches tall, and the general ones are three or four inches tall. Cotton farmers are actively carrying out seedling protection work. Jiujiang and Pengze counties have thinned the seedlings once on more than 12,000 mu of cotton fields. Duchang and Xingzi counties have applied the first fertilizer to 1,400 mu. In the Jiangbei district of Pengze County, ditching and drainage in cotton fields have been done better than in previous years. In the cotton fields of the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative, large ditches are connected to small ditches. In the Xiqi Agricultural Cooperative in Fuyong Township, a two-li long drainage ditch was opened. Cotton farmers are also actively carrying out pest control work. In Zhuling Township, Duchang County, an 87-member pest control team was formed, and in four days, it wiped out many cutworms, red spiders, cotton aphids, and other pests.
