    The more that is distributed for each labor day, the better the agricultural producers' cooperative is run. However, the value of each labor day must never be "increased" by any false or unreasonable means. Some agricultural producers' cooperatives ask members to do a portion of uncompensated "voluntary labor," which is one such method.
    In the Eighteenth Township of Bijie County, Guizhou Province, eight agricultural producers' cooperatives were established around the autumn harvest last year. After these agricultural producers' cooperatives were established, the responsible comrades of the Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party asked the members to do a portion of "voluntary labor" (without compensation) in production. They attempted to reduce the total number of labor days of the members and increase the remuneration for each labor day in this way, in order to demonstrate the superiority of the agricultural producers' cooperative. The "voluntary labor" done by the members of these eight agricultural producers' cooperatives included carrying river sand, building river embankments, leveling field ridges, collecting manure, preparing rice paddies, fighting drought by drawing water, digging ditches, building toilets, and artificial pollination of corn, etc. Each member had to do twelve to fifteen "voluntary labor" days a year, accounting for about fifteen percent of the total number of days worked by each member. One agricultural producers' cooperative stipulated that twenty percent of the members' annual labor days would be deducted as "voluntary labor." Later, this method was promoted in all forty-eight agricultural producers' cooperatives in the Second District of Bijie County (including agricultural producers' cooperatives in key townships of the county).
    The result of doing "voluntary labor" was exactly the opposite of what these comrades had hoped. The members saw that they could not get grain for doing voluntary labor, their enthusiasm for production declined, and they did the work very carelessly. In the Qianjin Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, a paddy field with a yield of 2.4 dan used to be filled by two people working for one day; now the cooperative sent four people to draw water for one day, and it was still not full. Xu Changrong, a member of the Wusi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, ran away after scooping water a few times when he was assigned to do it, in order to avoid "voluntary labor." Some heavy work could not be done by those with weak labor, so only those with strong labor took turns; the members with strong labor suffered losses and were very dissatisfied. The members with strong labor in the Yongjin Agricultural Producers' Cooperative saw that they had suffered losses, so they asked women and members with weak labor to do the same "voluntary labor" as them; if they could not do it, they were asked to withdraw from the cooperative, causing disunity; many women and members with weak labor had to request to withdraw from the cooperative. The cooperative staff found it difficult to arrange "voluntary labor" tasks. In order to carry out the "tasks" assigned by the district committee, they had to take the lead when they saw that the members were unwilling to do it; therefore, they did more "voluntary labor" than the members, some even doing half as much again as the members. The mutual aid teams and individual farmers became suspicious of the agricultural producers' cooperatives when they saw this situation. The members of the Wu Weixian joint team, who were preparing to establish a cooperative, said: If running an agricultural producers' cooperative is like this, we will wait and see.
    Obviously, this is an incorrect practice, which violates the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and the negative consequences for production are serious. To demonstrate the superiority of the agricultural producers' cooperative and increase the value of each labor day, the correct approach can only be to carry out arduous and meticulous work, give full play to the potential of labor and land, increase production, and reduce costs. Formalism that only seeks appearance and does not seek reality is very harmful.

    不能用做“义务工”的办法来提高劳动日的价值
    李真瑞
    每一个劳动日分得的东西越多，就说明农业生产合作社办得越好。可是，决不可用任何虚假或者不合理的办法来“提高”每个劳动日的价值。有些农业生产合作社要社员做一部分不取报酬的“义务工”，就是这种办法。
   贵州省毕节县十八乡，去年秋收前后成立了八个农业生产合作社。这些农业生产合作社成立后，中共第二区区委的负责同志就叫社员们在生产中做一部分“义务工”（不给报酬）。他们企图用这种办法，来减少社员的劳动日总数，增加每个劳动日的报酬，以显示农业生产合作社的优越性。这八个农业生产合作社的社员做的“义务工”，包括挑河沙、砌河埂、整田埂、出粪、打秧田、抗旱车水、挖沟、修厕所、玉米人工授粉等。每个社员一年要做十二个到十五个“义务工”，约占每个社员出工数的百分之十五左右。其中有一个农业生产合作社规定：在社员全年的劳动日中扣出百分之二十，作为“义务工”。后来，在毕节县第二区的四十八个农业生产合作社（其中包括县委重点乡的农业生产合作社）都推行了这种办法。
    做“义务工”的结果，恰恰同这些同志的愿望相反。社员们看到做义务工分不到粮食，生产情绪低落，做活路很毛糙。前进农业生产合作社有二石四斗产量的秧田，以往只要两个人车一天水就灌满；现在社里派了四个人去车了一天水，还没灌满。五四农业生产合作社社员徐长荣，为了逃避“义务工”，在派他戽水时，戽了几下就溜走了。有些重活路，劳动力弱的不能做，只有劳动力强的轮流做；劳动力强的社员吃了亏，很不满意。勇进农业生产合作社中劳动力强的社员，看到自己吃了亏，就叫妇女、劳力弱的社员和他们做一样的“义务工”；如果干不了，就叫退社，闹不团结；很多妇女和劳力弱的社员只好要求退社。社的工作人员安排“义务工”的活路感到困难，为了执行区委布置的“任务”，看到社员不愿干，只好自己带头；因此，他们做的“义务工”比社员多，有的比社员多做一半。互助组和单干农民，看到这种情形，对农业生产合作社也发生了怀疑。准备办社的吴维先联组的组员们说：办农业生产合作社要像这个样子，我们要等一等再说。
    很显然，这是一种不正确的做法，是违背自愿互利原则的，给生产带来的恶果是严重的。显示农业生产合作社的优越性，提高每个劳动日的价值，正确的做法只能是切实地进行艰苦细致的工作，充分发挥劳动和土地的潜力，提高生产，降低成本。只图表面、不求实际的形式主义，是十分有害的。
