Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Sichuan provinces, which account for more than 80% of the country's silk cocoon production, have largely completed their spring cocoon purchase work. Guangdong Province has completed 120% of its first batch of improved white cocoon purchase plan, Zhejiang Province has completed 108%, and Jiangsu Province and Sichuan Province are also close to completing their plans.

This year's spring cocoon production and quality have both improved significantly compared to 1954. In Guangdong Province, the average cocoon production per silkworm seed card for improved white cocoons is 35 jin, an increase of 24% compared to 1954. Zhejiang Province estimates it will reach 52 jin, an increase of 6% compared to 1954. Jiangsu Province averages 57 jin per card, an increase of 14% compared to 1954, and Sichuan Province's average production also increased by 10.4% compared to 1954. The unit yield of agricultural production cooperatives in various regions is even higher, with some reaching over 60 jin.

Due to the bumper harvest of spring cocoons and the improvement in cocoon quality, the income of silkworm farmers has generally increased, thereby increasing their enthusiasm for production. Currently, silkworm farmers are using the income from selling cocoons to purchase agricultural tools and fertilizers, and order summer and autumn silkworm seeds in order to expand reproduction.

    广东四川等四省春茧收购计划大体完成
    占全国蚕茧产量百分之八十以上的广东、浙江、江苏、四川四省，春茧收购工作已大体完成。广东省已完成第一造改良白茧收购计划的百分之一百二十，浙江省完成百分之一百零八，江苏省和四川省也都接近完成计划。
    今年春茧的产量和质量都比一九五四年提高很多，广东省改良白茧平均每张蚕种产茧三十五斤，比一九五四年增加百分之二十四，浙江省估计可达五十二斤，比一九五四年增加百分之六，江苏省平均每张五十七斤，比一九五四年增加百分之十四，四川省平均产量也比一九五四年增加了百分之十点四。各地农业生产合作社的单位产量更高，有些达到六十斤以上。
    由于春茧丰收和蚕茧质量的提高，蚕农收入普遍增加，因而提高了生产积极性。目前蚕农正用卖茧收入购买农具、肥料，订购夏秋蚕种，以便扩大再生产。　（徐淑英）
