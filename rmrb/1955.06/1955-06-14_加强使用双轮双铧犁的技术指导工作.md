    Strengthen Technical Guidance on the Use of Two-Wheel, Two-Furrow Plows
    Wang Yuting
    This year, the national plan is to promote 400,000 two-wheel, two-furrow plows, but only about 70,000 were promoted in the first quarter. One of the reasons why the promotion plan is not being completed well is that technical guidance work is not keeping up. Because technical guidance work has not been done well, many farmers are unwilling to buy two-wheel, two-furrow plows; some farmers who have bought plows do not know how to use them. An agricultural production cooperative in Zhongyuedian Township, Changge County, Henan Province, bought a two-wheel, two-furrow plow and used two castrated oxen and a strong mule to pull it for plowing, but because they did not know how to use it, the plow did not dig into the soil. The cooperative members said the new plow was not good and did not want it. Some agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong Province bought two-wheel, two-furrow plows, but because they did not understand the technology, they planned to wait a year before using them. The two-wheel, two-furrow plows planned for promotion this year will be supplied to farmers mostly during the summer planting, autumn plowing, and winter plowing seasons. To make these two-wheel, two-furrow plows work, technical instruction and guidance must be strengthened now.
    Last winter, all regions trained some farmer technicians in the use of two-wheel, two-furrow plows; however, many of these technicians still do not understand the technology. Because the weather was cold and the ground was frozen during the winter, training could only be taught through oral explanations, demonstrations, and other methods, and no field trials could be conducted. Now, these trained technicians are encountering many difficulties in actual use. Taking Henan Province, which has done a relatively good job in training, as an example, more than 10 percent of the more than 60,000 technicians trained throughout the province have not mastered the technology of using two-wheel, two-furrow plows. Some technicians do not know how to raise the tail wheel when plowing, and they do not know how to operate the plowing depth adjuster. Some do not even know to tighten the screws when they are loose. Therefore, agricultural leading organs at all levels should not be satisfied with the achievements made in winter training, but should include technical instruction as a regular task. Agricultural technicians in all regions should pay special attention to going to the countryside and fields to provide on-site guidance, helping farmer technicians overcome difficulties in actual use, and consolidate and improve the technology they have already learned.
    In order to enable more farmers to master the technology of using two-wheel, two-furrow plows, all regions can organize farmers to teach and learn from each other. Teng County, Shandong Province, organized trained farmer technicians who had mastered a certain degree of technology to teach others using the method of taking apprentices, and trained a total of 291 new technicians. Some regions organized farmer technicians into technical research groups and compiled technical networks. Technical guidance personnel provided guidance through the technical networks. Some small problems were solved after everyone studied them at group meetings, and problems that could not be solved were smoothly solved after guidance from technical guidance personnel. This not only overcame the difficulty of insufficient technical guidance personnel, but also stimulated the enthusiasm of farmer technicians for studying technology.
    To do a good job in technical guidance, agricultural departments and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must equip themselves with a certain number of technical guidance personnel. Some counties in Henan and Shandong Provinces have set up a full-time technical worker in each district to be responsible for providing technical instruction and guidance. Some counties have trained production assistants of district people's committees to master the technology of using two-wheel, two-furrow plows and assist technical personnel in their work. It is best not to transfer technical guidance personnel casually. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Siyang, Shuyang, and other four counties in Jiangsu Province originally had 23 staff members who understood the technology of using new-style animal-drawn farm tools; however, more than half of these people have been assigned to do other work. This phenomenon should be changed.
    In order to do a good job in the supply of two-wheel, two-furrow plows, the staff of the supply and marketing cooperatives responsible for supplying agricultural tools must overcome the idea of "only caring about supply and not about technology" and actively learn the technology of using two-wheel, two-furrow plows. The experience of many regions proves that: if you do not understand the technology, you cannot correctly publicize the benefits of new-style animal-drawn farm tools, and therefore you cannot do a good job in supply. The Yannan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huai'an County, Jiangsu Province, had three two-wheel, two-furrow plows, but because the people selling agricultural tools did not understand the technology and could not tell the farmers how to use them, the plows could not be sold. Many supply and marketing cooperative salespersons in Shanxi Province understand the technology of using two-wheel, two-furrow plows and can explain the benefits and usage methods of two-wheel, two-furrow plows to farmers, so they have done a very good job in promoting animal-drawn farm tools.

### 加强使用双轮双铧犁的技术指导工作

    加强使用双轮双铧犁的技术指导工作
    王玉廷
    今年全国计划推广双轮双铧犁四十万部，但第一季度仅推广了七万部左右。推广计划完成得不好的原因之一，是技术指导工作跟不上。由于技术指导工作没做好，许多农民都不愿买双轮双铧犁；有些农民买了犁也不会用。河南省长葛县中岳店乡有一个农业生产合作社买回去一部双轮双铧犁，用两头犍牛和一头壮骡拉着去耕地，因为不会使用，结果犁不吃土；社员们说新犁不好使，不愿要。山东省有的农业生产合作社买了双轮双铧犁，因不懂技术，准备放一年再说。今年计划推广的双轮双铧犁大部分将在夏种、秋耕、冬耕季节供应给农民，要使这批双轮双铧犁发挥作用，现在就必须加强技术传授和指导工作。
    去年冬天，各地都训练了一些使用双轮双铧犁的农民技术手；但是相当多的技术手仍然不懂技术。由于冬季天寒地冻，训练时只能用口头讲解、表演等方式教授，不能进行实地试验，现在这些经过训练的技术手在实际使用时，就遇到了很多困难。就以训练工作做得较好的河南省说，全省训练的六万多名技术手中，有百分之十以上不能掌握双轮双铧犁的使用技术。有的技术手在耕地时不知道抬尾轮，不会操纵耕深调节器，有的甚至连螺丝松了也不知道上紧。因此，各级农业领导机关不能满足于去冬训练中所取得的成绩，而应当把技术传授工作列为一项经常的工作。现在各地农业技术人员特别要注意下乡、下田实地进行指导，帮助农民技术手克服实际使用时的困难，巩固和提高已经学到的技术。
    为了使更多的农民掌握双轮双铧犁的使用技术，各地可以组织农民互教互学。山东滕县组织受过训练的掌握了一定技术的农民技术手用带徒弟的方法，向别人传授技术，共培养了二百九十一名新技术手。有的地区把农民技术手组织成技术研究小组，编成技术网，技术指导人员通过技术网进行指导，有些小问题，在小组碰头会上经过大家研究就解决了，不能解决的问题，经过技术指导人员指导，也就顺利解决了。这样既克服了技术指导人员不足的困难，又发挥了农民技术手钻研技术的积极性。
    要做好技术指导工作，各级农业部门和供销合作社必须配备一定的技术指导人员。河南、山东有些县内每区设一个专职的技术工作人员，负责传授技术和技术指导工作。有的县训练了区人民委员会的生产助理员，使他掌握双轮双铧犁的使用技术，协助技术人员进行工作。对技术指导人员最好不要随便调动，江苏省泗阳、沭阳等四个县的供销合作社本来有二十三名懂得新式畜力农具使用技术的工作人员；可是这些人有一多半被分配去做其他工作了。这种现象应该改变。
    为了做好双轮双铧犁的供应工作，供销社负责供应农具的工作人员要克服“只管供应、不管技术”的思想，积极学会双轮双铧犁的使用技术。很多地区的经验证明：不懂技术就不能正确宣传新式畜力农具的好处，因而也不能做好供应工作。江苏省淮安县盐南供销社有三部双轮双铧犁，因为卖农具的人不懂技术，不能告诉农民怎样使用，犁就一直卖不出去。山西省有不少供销社的业务员懂得双轮双铧犁的使用技术，能够向农民讲解双轮双铧犁的好处和使用方法，他们推销畜力农具的工作就做得很好。
