Absolutely No Counter-Revolutionary Elements Allowed to Hide Among the People
Shen Junru

The Hu Feng incident, thanks to the exposure by the people of the whole country, has come to light. After tearing off their masks, Hu Feng and his gang have revealed their hideous and terrifying true faces. From the "Third Batch of Materials Regarding the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" published in the "People's Daily" on June 10th, it can be seen that Hu Feng and the core members of his group were originally a counter-revolutionary black gang, who had been lurking within the people's democratic united front for a long time, and committed countless evil deeds that endangered the people and the country! The exposure of this shocking and evil incident is, without a doubt, another major victory for the people of our country on the political front.

For me, the Hu Feng incident is a startling and serious lesson. I knew Hu Feng very early on, but I never expected him to be so insidious, vicious, anti-communist and anti-people.

Although the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have often instructed us to be vigilant at all times, our political sensitivity is still not sharp enough. Our China Democratic League has discovered hidden traitors in the past, and now, after the Hu Feng incident has been exposed, we should accept this serious lesson even more. In particular, intellectuals should strengthen ideological remolding, raise their political consciousness, strictly distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and distinguish right from wrong, so as not to be deceived by counter-revolutionary secret agents. Only when the people of the whole country unite around the Chinese Communist Party, raise their political and ideological understanding, and wage a resolute struggle against enemies at home and abroad, can our people's democratic dictatorship be consolidated day by day, and the great cause of socialist construction can be quickly successful. Even though the enemy is launching overt and covert attacks inside and outside us, thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will surely be able to crush all the enemy's sabotage attempts and embark on the bright road to victory. As long as we are vigilant at all times and strengthen our fighting will, we have full confidence in the bright future of our motherland.

The Hu Feng clique's crimes of being anti-communist and anti-people are very serious and unforgivable. I hope that the People's Government will punish them most severely according to the law, and I believe that the People's Government will certainly do so. I also hope that the people of the whole country, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations will take the Hu Feng incident as a warning, and that all patriotic elements will unite to wage a merciless struggle against hidden enemies, and absolutely not allow any counter-revolutionary secret agents to hide within the people's democratic united front!

    决不容许反革命分子隐藏在人民内部
    沈钧儒
    胡风事件，由于全国人民的揭发，已经真相大白了。胡风和他的一伙，揭去假面具之后，已经显露出了狰狞可怕的真面目。从六月十日“人民日报”所公布的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”中可以看出：胡风和他的集团的核心分子，原来都是反革命黑帮，长期埋伏在人民民主统一战线内部，干了无数危害人民危害国家的罪恶勾当！这一惊人罪恶事件的揭发，毫无疑问，是我国人民在政治战线上又一次的重大胜利。
    对于我来说，胡风事件是一次惊心怵目的严重教训。我很早就认识胡风，却没有想到他是这样阴险恶毒，反共反人民的。
    虽然中国共产党和毛主席经常指示我们，要时刻提高警惕，但是我们的政治嗅觉仍然是不够灵敏的。我们中国民主同盟，过去曾经发现了暗藏的叛国分子，现在胡风事件揭发以后，我们更应该接受这一严重的事实教训。特别是知识分子，都应当加强思想改造，提高政治觉悟，严格地分清敌我，明辨是非，才不至受反革命特务分子的蒙蔽欺骗。只有全国人民团结在中国共产党周围，提高政治思想认识，向内外敌人进行坚决的斗争，我国的人民民主专政，才能日益巩固，伟大的社会主义建设事业才能迅速成功。尽管敌人在我们内部和外部，进行公开的和隐蔽的进攻，由于共产党毛主席的英明领导，中国人民一定能够粉碎敌人一切的破坏企图，走上光明的胜利道路。只要我们时刻提高警惕，加强战斗意志，我们对于祖国的光辉前途是有充分信心的。
    胡风集团反共反人民的罪行是十分严重的，是不可宽恕的。我希望人民政府依法予以最严正的惩治，并且我相信人民政府也一定会这样做。我更希望全国人民，各民主党派，各人民团体，都要以胡风事件为戒，一切爱国分子都要团结起来，向隐蔽的敌人作无情的斗争，决不能容许任何反革命特务分子，隐藏在人民民主统一战线内部！
