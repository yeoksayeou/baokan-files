To the Editor:

    In the Sunan Yugur Autonomous Region of Gansu Province, there is a team of young people, riding horses, driving camels, carrying medical equipment, medicine chests, and food, busily travelling between dense forests and deserts. When they encounter areas with a relatively high concentration of herdsmen, they set up tents made of yak hair and canvas, open their medicine chests, take out medical instruments and drugs, and conduct health and hygiene education. This is the Gansu Provincial National Medical Team serving the herdsmen.

    Once, in order to treat the herdsmen of Sidalong Township and Yangge Township, the medical team members climbed over nine mountains in five or six consecutive days. The mountains were covered with a dark, dense forest, in which various wild animals were hidden. There was only a narrow path in the forest, wide enough for one person to pass through, winding and twisting. But the team members were not intimidated by these difficulties, and finally passed through the high mountains and dense forests, and arrived at their destination. These two townships are inhabited by more than 500 households of Yugur, Tibetan, and Mongolian herdsmen. Due to the obstruction of the mountains, few people had ever entered, and even fewer doctors. A long time ago, a person carrying a medicine bag came there, gave a child an injection of penicillin, and asked the family for twenty sheep as medical expenses. Foreign doctors had left a very bad impression among the local people. However, now things are different, and the medical team has brought happiness to the herdsmen. An old lady named Lamousidan in the fourth village of Sidalong Township was already sixty-five years old. Unfortunately, she went blind in her left eye two years ago, and her only right eye was also facing danger: the conjunctiva was congested and red, and the edges of the upper eyelid had ulcerated. However, after the medical team's patient treatment, it has now recovered as well as a normal person's.

    The herdsmen warmly welcomed the medical team every time to thank them for their treatment. When the medical team was about to leave, the herdsmen would find some of their favorite things to give to the medical team. Many herdsmen, shedding tears of farewell, accompanied them for a long distance.

    一支为牧民服务的医疗队编辑同志：
    在甘肃省肃南裕固族自治区里，有一队青年，骑着马，赶着骆驼，驮着医疗器械、药箱和食物，忙碌地奔走在密林和沙漠之间。遇到牧民比较集中的地方，他们就张起牛毛和帆布的帐篷，打开药箱，取出医疗用具和药物，进行保健卫生的宣传。这就是一支为牧民服务的甘肃省民族医疗队。
    有一次，医疗队为了给寺大隆乡、杨格乡的牧民治病，队员们接连五六天翻越了九座大山。山上是一片黑呼呼的大森林，森林中隐藏着各种野兽。森林里只有可容一人通过的小道，弯弯曲曲。但是队员们没有被这些困难所吓倒，终于通过了高山密林，到达了目的地。这两个乡，居住着五百多户裕固族、藏族、蒙族的牧民，由于大山阻隔，一向很少有人进去，更少有医生进去。在很早以前，有个提药包的人到过那里，给小孩注射了一针盘尼西林，向这家要了二十只羊的医药费用。外来的医生在当地人民中留下了很坏的印象。可是，现在不同了，医疗队给牧民们带来了幸福。寺大隆乡四村拉茅斯丹老太太已经六十五岁了，不幸，两年前她的左眼瞎了，仅有的一只右眼，也面临着危险的地步：结膜充血发红，上眼皮边沿已经溃烂。但是，经过医疗队的耐心治疗，现在已恢复得和常人一样。
    牧民们为了感谢医疗队的救治，每次都热情地接待他们。当医疗队将要离开的时候，牧民们找出一些心爱的东西来送给医疗队。不少的牧民，流着惜别的眼泪，一直把他们送到很远的地方。
