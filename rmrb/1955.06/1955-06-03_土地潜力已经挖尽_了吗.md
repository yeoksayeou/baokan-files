Has the Potential of the Land Been Fully Tapped?
Song Jie
The Lianzhong First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Chengpo Village, Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, were all established in 1952. Ninety percent of the village's farmers joined these four cooperatives. In the two years following the establishment of the cooperatives, crop yields increased year by year, and the village was recognized as one of Shouzhang County's model production villages.

After the increase in production, some cooperative staff members believed that "the potential of the land had been fully tapped." To continue increasing production and income, they needed to find other production avenues. Thus, in the third year after the establishment of the cooperatives—1954—the four agricultural production cooperatives in Chengpo Village partnered with four people from Yanggu County who were engaged in chicken hatching for more than half a year.

That spring, farmers in other villages in Chengpo Township actively dug wells and accumulated fertilizer to prepare for spring plowing, but the agricultural production cooperatives in Chengpo Village were busy making adobe bricks, building kangs (heated platforms), and constructing chicken hatching houses. That year, in order to hatch chickens, the four agricultural production cooperatives in Chengpo Village not only mobilized all cooperative members to invest 900 yuan, but also used all 425 yuan of the national loan allocated for purchasing waterwheels, livestock, and fertilizer for chicken hatching expenses. Each cooperative also drew more than ten laborers for chicken hatching. As a result, the 700 mu of farmland of these four cooperatives were not renovated as scheduled, and 280 mu of irrigated land were not watered in time. Millet, corn, and other crops grew yellow and short, resulting in significant yield reductions. The 540 mu of soybeans also received two fewer weedings, resulting in a yield reduction of 20 jin per mu. The Lianzhong Sixth Agricultural Production Cooperative, which had more poor peasant members, suffered the most significant yield reduction. This cooperative had very little capital to begin with. After using the members' investments and national loans for chicken hatching, they had little capital left for land management. That year, 90 mu of corn and 31 mu of millet in the Lianzhong Sixth Agricultural Production Cooperative were not densely planted due to lack of fertilizer and received two fewer weedings, resulting in a yield reduction of 80 jin per mu. The 151 mu of soybeans sown in the summer were also planted six days late on 64 mu due to lack of money to buy seeds, resulting in a yield reduction of 45 jin per mu. Although the four agricultural production cooperatives in Chengpo Village received some income from chicken hatching that year, the agricultural production plans of each cooperative were not completed, resulting in a total estimated reduction of more than 36,300 jin of grain. Overall, it was a losing proposition.

What lessons should the four agricultural production cooperatives in Chengpo Village learn from the production in 1954? Judging from the above facts, the main reason for the decline in grain yield and the losses suffered by these four cooperatives was that they relaxed the processing and management of the land and used all the national loans and most of the production investment for chicken hatching. To increase income, old cooperatives can and should, according to their own conditions, try to increase some production content and diversify their operations, such as developing horticulture, forestry, animal husbandry, and livestock and poultry breeding. However, after two consecutive years of increased production, these four cooperatives mistakenly believed that the potential of the land had been fully tapped and made chicken hatching the main production content, relaxing the processing and management of the land (which is the main aspect of agricultural production).

Has the potential of the land of these four cooperatives been fully tapped? This spring, with the help of the Chengpo Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, these four cooperatives discussed this issue. During the discussion, the members found that on the same land, yields would vary depending on the difference in farming techniques or crop varieties. For example, last year the corn yield in Chengpo Village was generally more than 200 jin per mu, but the 90 mu of corn in the Lianzhong Sixth Agricultural Production Cooperative yielded only more than 130 jin per mu because it was not densely planted and received two fewer weedings. Last year, 60 percent of the farmland of these four cooperatives was planted with improved varieties such as "Huanong No. 4" millet, "Golden Queen" corn, and "Victory No. 100" sweet potato, and the yields were generally about 20 percent higher than local varieties. After carefully calculating this account, the members realized that as long as they continued to improve farming techniques, select superior varieties, and increase investment, the yield of the land could continue to increase, and they believed that the view that "the potential of the land has been fully tapped" was wrong.

This year, these four cooperatives plan to renovate the farmland with wells but no irrigation facilities, convert it into ridge fields, and expand the irrigated land by 175 mu. In order to make full use of the land, they plan to intercrop soybeans in sorghum fields and mung beans in corn fields. All millet, corn, and other crops will be densely planted. They will increase the planting of high-yielding crops such as upland rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and corn, and universally select improved varieties such as "Golden Queen" corn, "Huanong No. 4" millet, and "Victory No. 100" sweet potato. In addition, they will improve farming techniques, deep plow and finely rake, and increase the application of natural fertilizers. It is estimated that the four agricultural production cooperatives in Chengpo Village will increase grain production by 82,700 jin in 1955 compared to 1954. The members of each cooperative are happy with this plan. They further understand that as long as they are willing to use their brains to find solutions and do not go down the wrong path, there is still no end to the increased production of old cooperatives.

### “土地潜力已经挖尽”了吗

    “土地潜力已经挖尽”了吗
    宋杰
    山东省寿张县城坡村的联众第一、第四、第五和第六等四个农业生产合作社，都是在一九五二年组成的。全村百分之九十的农户都参加了这四个社。在社成立后的头两年，庄稼的产量一年比一年提高，这个村被评为寿张县的生产模范村之一。
    产量提高以后，一部分社的工作人员认为“土地的潜力已经挖尽”，要想继续增加生产，增加收入，就得找别的生产门路。这样，在建社后的第三年——一九五四年，城坡村的四个农业生产合作社就和阳谷县四个经营孵鸡的人，合伙经营了半年多的孵鸡生产。
    这年春天，城坡乡其他村的农民，都积极地打井、积肥，迎接春耕生产，但城坡村的农业生产合作社却忙着打坯、修炕、盖孵鸡房。这一年，城坡村的四个农业生产合作社为了孵鸡，除动员全体社员投入九百元资金外，又把国家贷给购买水车、牲口和肥料的四百二十五元，全部用作经营孵鸡的费用了；各社为孵鸡还抽出了十多个劳力。结果，这四个社的七百多亩农田没能如期整修，二百八十亩水浇地没能及时浇水，谷子、玉米等作物长得又黄又矮，减产很多；五百四十多亩大豆都少锄两遍，每亩减产二十斤。减产最多的是贫农社员较多的联众第六农业生产合作社。这个社的资金本来就很少，他们把社员的投资和国家的贷款用来孵鸡后，经营土地就没有什么资金了。这一年，联众第六农业生产合作社的九十亩玉米和三十一亩谷子因缺肥没有密植，又少锄了两遍，结果每亩减产八十斤。这个社夏季播种的一百五十一亩大豆，也因没钱买豆种，有六十四亩晚种了六天，每亩减产四十五斤。这一年，城坡村的四个农业生产合作社虽然从孵鸡中得到了一部分收入，可是，各社的农业生产计划都没有完成，约计共减产粮食三万六千三百多斤，整个说来是得不偿失。
    城坡村的四个农业生产合作社从一九五四年的生产中应该取得什么教训呢？从上面的事实看来，这四个社放松了对土地的加工管理，把全部国家贷款和绝大部分的生产投资用到孵鸡方面，这是这四个社粮食产量降低、生产受到损失的主要原因。老社为了增加收入，按照本身的条件，尽量设法增加一些生产内容，进行多种经营，如发展园艺、林业、牧业、家畜家禽饲养业等生产是可以的，也是必要的。但是这四个社在连续两年得到增产以后，就认为土地的潜力已经挖尽，把孵鸡作为主要生产内容，放松了对土地的加工管理（这是农业生产的主要方面），这是错误的。
    这四个社的土地的潜力是不是已经挖尽了呢？今年春天，在中共城坡乡支部委员会的帮助下，这四个社对这个问题进行了讨论。社员们在讨论中发现：在同样的土地上，因为耕作技术或作物品种有差别，收成就会两样。例如去年城坡村的玉米一般每亩都收获二百多斤；但联众第六农业生产合作社的九十亩玉米，因没有密植，又少锄两遍，每亩仅收
  一百三十多斤。去年这四个社有百分之六十的农田播种“华农四号”谷、“金皇后”玉米和“胜利百号”甘薯等良种，产量一般的都高出当地品种百分之二十左右。细算了这笔账以后，社员们认识到只要不断改进耕作技术、选用优良品种、增加投资等，土地的产量还可以继续提高，认为“土地潜力已经挖尽”的看法是错误的。
    这四个社今年计划把有井而没有浇到的农田普遍进行整修，改成畦田，扩大水浇地一百七十五亩；为了充分利用地力，准备在高粱地里间种小豆，玉米地里间种绿豆；谷子、玉米等作物全部采用密植办法；增种旱稻、马铃薯、甘薯、玉米等高产作物，并普遍选用“金皇后”玉米、“华农四号”谷和“胜利百号”甘薯等良种。此外，还要提高耕作技术，深耕细耙，增施自然肥料。估计城坡村的四个农业生产合作社一九五五年共可比一九五四年增产粮食八万二千七百斤。各社的社员们都为这个计划感到高兴。他们更进一步地懂得了：只要肯动脑筋想办法，不走错路，老社的增产仍是没有止境的。
