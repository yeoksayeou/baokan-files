Unforgettable Indian Music and Dance
Zhou Erfu, Deputy Head of the People's Republic of China's Cultural Delegation to India

From December 6, 1954, when we arrived in Delhi, the capital of India, until January 29, 1955, when we left Calcutta, India's largest city, our hosts arranged wonderful evenings to welcome and entertain us in every place we visited. At these evenings, we saw Indian dances with distinctive characteristics and high levels of technique, and beautiful Indian music.

Indian classical dance originated from religion and was used to worship gods. The Hindu god of destruction, Shiva, is considered the originator of Indian classical dance. There are four main schools of Indian classical dance, prevalent in various parts of India: North India has Kathak and Manipuri dances, and South India has Kathakali and Bharatanatyam dances. Kathakali is popular in the Malabar region, and Bharatanatyam is popular in Madras. Kathakali is the most dramatic, not just a simple dance, but an art of expressive movement, with sixty-four hand gestures that can express more than five hundred meanings, and even tell a complete story. Its content is mostly taken from the two major epics, "Ramayana" or "Mahabharata." Dance, music, and poetry are combined to form a unique art form. This dance requires a soft and agile body, mastering subtle symbolic movements of the eyes, eyebrows, lips, head, and chest. This dance is almost entirely performed by men, and female roles are also played by men. Head decorations and face painting are very important. We can distinguish between good, evil, civilian, and military roles from the facial makeup, which is somewhat similar to the facial makeup in our Peking Opera. Bharatanatyam dance is performed in the temple of Shiva, and it is a dance with tradition, high style, and strict rules. This dance includes two types, one is a pantomime and the other is pure dance. It is generally performed solo by women because the dance was originally to worship gods, so it must be performed solo. Now it is widely performed publicly. To meet the requirements of stage art, it is sometimes danced by a man and a woman, or a group of two or three women dancing together. Kathak dance is deeply influenced by Islamic art, focusing on detailed footwork performance. Manipuri dance is soft and beautiful, but the softness reveals perseverance, and the beauty carries boldness. It is a classical dance originating in the eastern frontier of India.

We had the opportunity to see these four schools of classical dance during our visit to India. On the second day of the Republic of India's National Day, I also visited the folk dance performance held at the Delhi National Stadium to celebrate the National Day. Dancers from twenty-three provinces and cities performed the most exciting folk dance programs from their respective provinces and cities. After watching this folk dance performance, I had some preliminary understanding of Indian dance. Indian dance art not only has its unique and outstanding position in the world of dance art with its classical dance, but also its folk dance is very rich and has a bright and splendid future. Folk dance is full of life, very lively, healthy, simple, and beautiful. After processing and sorting, its future will be broader.

During our visit to India, every place we visited illustrated one fact: Indian dance and music are of a very high standard, which can be seen not only in cities but also in rural areas; not only adults love dance and music, but also children love dance and music. Often six- or seven-year-old children participate in three- or four-hour evening parties with us, quietly sitting there to appreciate. We are often immersed in the beautiful Indian dance and music.

Because of our love for Indian dance and music, even during such busy days during our visit to India, our dancers and musicians squeezed out time to learn from Indian dancers and musicians. Comrade Dai Ailian learned Bharatanatyam classical dance and Manipuri classical dance. The dancers learned Ajanta's Dream, South Indian folk dance - Gypsy Dance, Indian Orissa folk dance - Three Fishermen, etc.; the singers learned Ox Cart Song and Wedding Song, etc.; the musicians also learned some Indian musical instruments. We brought back the programs we learned from Indian artists to our motherland and performed them in Beijing, which was widely welcomed by the Chinese people.

When we visited India, everyone had a common hope: it would be best if the Indian side sent a cultural delegation to visit China, so that the vast Chinese people could directly see India's great and excellent art. As we were about to end our visit to India, we learned that the Indian government had accepted the invitation of the People's Republic of China and would send a cultural delegation to visit China. This was such exciting news. When we left India, we expressed our hope to welcome the Indian cultural delegation in Beijing as soon as possible. After we returned to Beijing, we looked forward to the arrival of the Indian cultural delegation every day.

Now, the Indian cultural delegation headed by Mr. Anil Kumar Chanda has finally arrived in Beijing. This is a major event in the cultural exchange between China and India. The mutual visits of cultural delegations from the two countries not only spread their respective excellent cultures, but also enhance mutual feelings and understanding. Friendship between peoples is the best guarantee of peace. Friendly cooperation between China and India is a major force in maintaining peace in Asia and world peace.

Please allow me to express my warm welcome to you here - messengers of culture, messengers of friendship, and messengers of peace! And I wish you a successful visit and performance!

    难忘的印度音乐和舞蹈
    中华人民共和国访问印度文化代表团副团长　周而复
    从一九五四年十二月六日到达印度首都德里那天起，到一九五五年一月二十九日离开印度最大的城市——加尔各答止这一期间，我们每到一个地方，主人都安排了非常精彩的晚会欢迎我们，招待我们。在晚会上，我们看到富有鲜明特色和高度技术的印度舞蹈和优美的印度音乐。
    印度古典舞蹈起源于宗教，作敬神用的，印度教中破坏神湿婆被认为印度古典舞蹈的始祖。印度古典舞主要有四个学派，盛行于印度各个地方：北印度是卡塔克舞和曼尼普利舞，南印度是卡塔卡利舞和巴拉达那蒂亚舞。卡塔卡利舞流行于马拉巴尔地区，巴拉达那蒂亚舞流行于马德拉斯。卡塔卡利最富有戏剧性，不是单纯的舞蹈，而是一种表情动作的艺术，共有六十四种手指表情姿势，能表达五百宗以上的意思，甚至完全可以表达一个完整的故事。其内容多半取自“拉马雅纳”或“墨哈勃赫勒特”两大史诗。舞蹈、音乐和诗歌结合起来，成为一种具有独特风格的艺术形式。这种舞蹈需要有柔和敏捷的身材，掌握眼、眉、唇、头和胸等各种示意性的微妙的动作。这舞蹈差不多全由男子表演，剧中女角也由男子扮演。头部装饰和画脸非常重要，我们可以从角色的脸谱中分辨出善、恶、文、武。这同我们的京剧的脸谱有些近似。巴拉达那蒂亚舞蹈是在湿婆神的庙里跳的，它是一个有传统有高度风格和严谨规律的舞蹈。这个舞蹈包括两种，一种是哑剧形式的，一种是纯舞蹈的。一般由女子单独表演，因当初舞蹈是敬神的，故要单独表演，现在已普遍公开表演。为了适合舞台艺术的要求，有时由一男一女跳，或者二三女子组成一组同舞。卡塔克舞受回教艺术的影响很深，着重细致的步法表演。曼尼普利舞柔和而优美，但柔和里又现出坚毅，优美中带有豪放，是产生在印度东部边疆的古典舞。
    这四个学派的古典舞蹈我们在访问印度期间都有机会看到了。印度共和国国庆的第二天，我在德里国立体育场又参观了为了庆祝国庆而举行的民间舞蹈会演，有二十三个省市的舞蹈家演出了各省市最精彩的民间舞蹈节目。看了这次民间舞蹈会演以后，我对印度的舞蹈才算有了一些初步的认识。印度的舞蹈艺术，不但它的古典舞在世界舞蹈艺术中有它独特的卓越的地位，而且民间舞蹈更是非常丰富且具有光辉灿烂的前途。民间舞蹈充满了生活气息，非常生动、健康、朴素、优美，经过加工整理以后，它的前途将更广阔。
    在我们访问印度期间，每到一个地方都说明一个事实：印度的舞蹈和音乐是具有很高水平的，不但在城市里，而且在农村里也可以看出这个事实；不仅成年的人爱好舞蹈和音乐，而且小孩子也喜爱舞蹈和音乐，常常有六七岁的小孩子和我们一道参加三四小时的晚会，静静地坐在那儿欣赏。我们经常沉醉在印度优美的舞蹈和音乐里。
    由于我们对印度舞蹈和音乐的爱好，即使在访问印度期间那样繁忙的日子里，我们的舞蹈家和音乐家也挤出时间来向印度的舞蹈家音乐家学习。戴爱莲同志学会了巴拉达那蒂亚古典舞和曼尼普利古典舞，舞蹈演员们学会了阿旃塔的梦幻、南印度民间舞——吉普赛舞、印度奥瑞萨民间舞——三个渔夫等；歌唱家学会了牛车之歌和结婚之歌等；音乐家还学习了一些印度乐器。我们把向印度艺术家学习的节目带回了祖国，在北京演出，受到中国人民普遍的欢迎。
    我们在访问印度的时候，大家都有一个共同的希望：最好是印度方面派一个文化代表团到中国来访问，广大的中国人民就可以直接看到印度的伟大的优秀的艺术了。在我们快要结束印度访问的时候，我们知道了印度政府接受中华人民共和国的邀请，将要派一个文化代表团访问中国。这是多么令人兴奋的消息。在我们离开印度的时候，我们就表示希望早日能够在北京欢迎印度文化代表团。我们回到北京以后，更是每天期待印度文化代表团的到来。
    现在，以阿尼尔·库玛尔·钱达先生为首的印度
  文化代表团终于到达了北京。这是中印两国文化交流的一件大事。两国文化代表团的相互访问，不但传播了各自的优秀的文化，而且会增进相互之间的感情和了解。人民之间的友谊是和平的最好的保证。中印两国的友好合作是维护亚洲和平和世界和平的重大力量。
    请允许我在这儿对你们——文化的使者、友谊的使者和和平的使者表示热烈的欢迎！并预祝你们访问演出成功！
