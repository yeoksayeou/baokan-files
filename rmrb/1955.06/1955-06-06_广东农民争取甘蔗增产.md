Guangdong Farmers Strive for Increased Sugarcane Production

    The 1.26 million mu of sugarcane planned to be planted in Guangdong Province this year has been basically completed. The planting area this year has exceeded the pre-war level by 35%; it has also expanded by more than 100,000 mu compared to last year, which will increase the production of raw sugarcane by 6 million dan. Currently, the seedlings of ratoon cane have generally grown to more than two chi (Chinese foot) high, and newly planted sugarcane has also sprouted tender green shoots. Farmers are busy checking seedlings, replanting, eliminating insects and weeds, and applying top dressing. This year, the enthusiasm of sugarcane farmers for production is much higher than in previous years. In the Pearl River Delta region, which grows the most sugarcane in the province, farmers have set large-scale production increase plans averaging more than 6,000 jin of sugarcane per mu. Farmers in Xinshisong and thirteen other townships in Shunde County have all expressed their intention to strive for the title of "10,000-jin township" this year. In order to support sugarcane farmers' production and increase the yield and sugar content of sugarcane, the state will supply sugarcane farmers with 79,500 mu of improved sugarcane varieties this year. State-owned sugar factories have successively entrusted more than half of the advance purchase deposits to supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties to purchase soybean cakes and ammonium sulfate fertilizers for sugarcane farmers. At the same time, during the sugarcane planting period, sugarcane technology training classes, mainly for cadres of production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, have been held successively in various places to further implement advanced cultivation techniques.

    广东农民争取甘蔗增产
    广东省今年计划种植的一百二十六万亩甘蔗已基本种植完毕。今年种植面积已超过战前水平百分之三十五；比去年也扩大了十万多亩，将增产六百万担原料甘蔗。目前宿根蔗的蔗苗已普遍长至二尺多高，新植蔗也已吐出嫩绿的新芽，农民们正忙着查苗补苗，除虫除草和追肥。今年蔗农的生产积极性比往年大大提高，全省种蔗最多的珠江三角洲地区，农民都订出平均每亩甘蔗产量六千多斤的大面积增产计划。顺德县新石松等十三个乡的农民都表示今年要争取获得“万斤乡”的称号。为了支持蔗农生产，提高甘蔗的收获量和糖份，国家今年供应蔗农七万九千五百亩的甘蔗良种。各国营糖厂已陆续将一半以上的预购定金委托各县供销合作社代购大豆饼及硫酸铵等肥料供蔗农使用。同时各地在种植甘蔗期间，先后举办了以生产合作社互助组干部为主的甘蔗技术训练班，进一步贯彻先进的栽培技术。　（萧俊城）
