    Actively Participate in the Great Struggle to Eliminate All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    Hu Yaobang
    The editorial department of "People's Daily" has handed over the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to the "People's Publishing House" for publication. I believe that all Youth League members and patriotic youth who are able to read will definitely have a copy; and through careful reading and serious discussion, they will greatly enhance their socialist consciousness, greatly enhance their revolutionary vigilance, learn the ability to fight against all counter-revolutionary elements, and contribute their strength to the great socialist cause.
    We say that we must greatly enhance our socialist revolutionary consciousness, because only in this way can we avoid being fooled by all counter-revolutionary elements, and strictly distinguish ourselves from all counter-revolutionary elements who disguise themselves as revolutionaries. Our broad masses of Youth League members and youth are full of socialist revolutionary enthusiasm. All hidden counter-revolutionary elements are clear that they cannot lure young people away from the revolutionary road by blatant means. However, all counter-revolutionary elements also know that young people have the weakness of insufficient knowledge and experience, and it is entirely possible to deceive and hoodwink young people into being fooled. Therefore, all counter-revolutionary elements pay special attention to carrying out evil activities among young people. Counter-revolutionary elements always take advantage of the ignorance of some young people, spread all kinds of reactionary views, paralyze and diminish the revolutionary will of these young people, and then capture them; counter-revolutionary elements always take advantage of the individualistic emotions of some young people, luring these young people step by step into the deep pit of anti-Party and anti-people; counter-revolutionary elements always take advantage of the psychology of some young people who are pursuing unhealthy sentimentalities, and use various despicable means to drag these young people into the counter-revolutionary conspiracy groups. These conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements are clearly recorded in the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique continuously published in the "People's Daily." We must be seriously vigilant. All young comrades who have only been ideologically influenced by Hu Feng's elements but are willing to make revolution should wake up in time and learn lessons from it. All young comrades who have not been fooled by counter-revolutionary elements should not be proud either. Not being fooled by counter-revolutionary elements today still requires that they never be fooled by counter-revolutionary elements. To achieve this, one should never neglect politics at any time, always put the interests of the people and the collective above personal interests, and strive to understand the laws of class struggle, combining revolutionary enthusiasm with revolutionary firmness.
    We say that we must greatly enhance our revolutionary vigilance, because only in this way can we eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is only a preliminary victory in the serious struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Because not only have all the criminals of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique not been completely caught; but also many other counter-revolutionary groups or individual counter-revolutionary elements have not been investigated and cleared out. The reason why all hidden counter-revolutionary elements can still temporarily escape justice is mainly because our eyes are not bright enough. Therefore, every revolutionary youth must learn from the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique the ability to distinguish all counter-revolutionary elements. We have all the possibilities to clear out all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. The reason why we can clear out all hidden counter-revolutionary elements is because the strength of counter-revolutionary elements is very small compared to the strength of our people. The reason why we can clear out all hidden counter-revolutionary elements is also because all counter-revolutionary elements have insurmountable contradictions. Any most cunning counter-revolutionary element may disguise a revolutionary face, but can never hide his counter-revolutionary tail. Any stubborn counter-revolutionary element may destroy the reactionary evidence around him, but can never destroy other evidence besides him. As long as we keep our eyes open, strengthen our revolutionary sense of responsibility a thousand times, and tell the organization about the crimes we hear and smell that can be determined as the activities of counter-revolutionary elements, we can make the counter-revolutionary elements hidden in our revolutionary ranks reveal their true colors and have nowhere to hide.
    The great struggle to thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements to ensure socialist construction has unfolded. A solemn task before all Youth League members and all patriotic youth is to, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, bravely and actively, calmly and firmly, carry out this struggle to the end and achieve complete victory.

    积极参加清除一切暗藏反革命分子的伟大斗争
    胡耀邦
    “人民日报”编辑部把关于胡风反革命集团的材料交由“人民出版社”出版了。我相信，一切有阅读能力的青年团员和爱国青年，必然会人手一册；并且通过仔细的阅读，认真的讨论，把自己的社会主义觉悟大大地提高起来，把自己的革命警惕性大大地提高起来，学会同一切反革命分子作斗争的本领，为伟大的社会主义事业贡献自己的力量。
    我们说，必须大大地提高自己的社会主义革命的自觉性，是因为只有如此，才能不上一切反革命分子的当，才能同一切伪装革命的反革命分子严格划清界限。我们的广大团员和青年是充满着社会主义革命热情的，一切暗藏的反革命分子都清楚，用明目张胆的办法是不能勾引青年人离开革命道路的，但是一切反革命分子又懂得，青年人有着知识不足经验不足的弱点，完全可能用欺骗蒙蔽的办法使青年人上当的。因而一切反革命分子特别重视在青年人中进行罪恶的活动。反革命分子总是利用某些青年人的无知，散布各色各样的反动观点，麻痹和消失这些青年的革命意志，然后对他们加以俘掳；反革命分子总是利用某些青年个人主义的情绪，引诱这些青年一步一步地堕落到反党反人民的深坑中去；反革命分子总是利用某些青年追寻那些不健康的温情的心理，用各种卑鄙的手法把这些青年拖入到反革命的阴谋集团中去。反革命分子的这些阴谋，在“人民日报”连续发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料中载得明明白白。我们必须严重地警惕。一切只是受了胡风分子思想影响但是愿意革命的青年同志应该及时猛省，从中吸取教训。一切没有上反革命分子的当的青年同志也不应该骄傲，今天没有上反革命分子的当，还要做到永远不上反革命分子的当。要做到这一点，任何时候都不应该忽视政治，任何时候都要把人民的利益、集体的利益放在个人利益之上，都要努力通晓阶级斗争的规律，把革命的热情和革命的坚定性结合起来。
    我们说，必须大大地提高自己的革命警惕性，是因为只有如此，才能把一切暗藏的反革命分子清除干净。胡风反革命集团的被揭露，对于清除一切暗藏的反革命分子这一严重的斗争来说，还只是初步的胜利。因为不仅胡风反革命集团的全部罪犯还没有统统落网；而且还有许多其他的反革命集团或者单干的反革命分子没有被清查出来。一切暗藏的反革命分子之所以还能暂时逍遥法外，主要是由于我们的眼睛不亮的缘故。因而每个革命青年都必须从关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料中学会辨别一切反革命分子的能力。我们是有着一切的可能把一切暗藏的反革命分子清查出来的。我们之所以能够把
  一切暗藏的反革命分子清查出来，是因为反革命分子的力量同我们人民的力量比起来毕竟是非常渺小的。我们之所以能够把一切暗藏的反革命分子清查出来，还因为一切反革命分子有着不可克服的矛盾。任何最狡诈的反革命分子虽然可能伪装起一副革命的嘴脸，但绝不能掩盖起他的反革命的尾巴。任何一个顽固的反革命分子虽然可能毁去它身边的反动罪证，但绝不能毁去它身边以外的其它的罪证。只要我们擦亮眼睛，千百倍地加强自己的革命责任感，把听到的和嗅到的而可以断定是反革命分子活动的罪行告诉给组织，就可以使隐藏在我们革命队伍中的反革命分子原形毕露，无法躲藏。
    彻底清除胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏反革命分子以保障社会主义建设的伟大斗争展开了。摆在全体青年团员和一切爱国青年面前的一项庄严的任务，就是要同全国人民一道，在伟大的中国共产党领导下，英勇积极，沉着坚定，把这个斗争进行到底，取得完满的胜利。
