    The Mingxing First Agricultural Production Cooperative of He Zhuang Township, Xuchang County, Henan Province, has improved the cooperative’s busy season nursery based on the principles of proceeding from reality and saving expenses. The nursery had made mistakes last year such as extravagance and formalism, like uniformly making clothes for the children, and collectively purchasing tea sets and toys. In the winter of 1954, the cooperative expanded. In order to concentrate efforts on doing a good job in production and increasing the actual income of the members, it was necessary to save unnecessary expenses in all aspects; at the same time, mothers also felt that the previous way of managing children was inconvenient. Therefore, they studied a method of voluntarily combining according to the distance of the members' residences, and flexibly implemented the management of children by teams, groups, and households. That is, some are uniformly managed by dozens of households, with the cooperative and the mothers providing appropriate work points to the caregivers; some neighbors help each other, taking turns to take care of the children, with an elderly person taking care of the children of several neighbors, with the caregiver receiving one point each day from the cooperative's public welfare fund and the child's mother; or the elderly in each household take turns to take care of the children and do farm work in turn, without additional remuneration; some households have elderly people who are willing to take care of their own children alone, and they are allowed to do so at their own discretion. In this way, it not only saves the cooperative's expenses, but also eliminates the trouble for mothers of having to send and pick up their children from afar every day, and all members of the cooperative are very satisfied.

    许昌县明星第一农业社改进农忙托儿所工作
    河南省许昌县贺庄乡明星第一农业生产合作社，本着从实际出发和节省开支的原则，改进了社里的农忙托儿所。这个托儿所去年曾犯过铺张浪费、追求形式的毛病，像统一给孩子们做衣服，集体购买茶具、玩具等。一九五四年冬天合作社扩大了，为了集中力量搞好生产，增加社员的实际收入，要从各方面节省不必要的开支；同时母亲们也嫌过去那种管理孩子的方式不方便。因此他们研究出按照社员居住远近自愿结合的办法，灵活地实行分队、分组、分户看管孩子。即有的是几十户统一看管，由社内和母亲们双方补给保育员适当的工分；有的邻里互助，轮流看管，几家邻居的小孩由一个老人看管，每天由社内公益金中和孩子的妈妈各出一分给看管人；或者由各户的老人轮流看管，轮流下地做活，不另给报酬；有的户有老年人愿单独看管自己的孩子的，也由其自便。这样，既节省了社内开支，也免去了母亲们每天远路送接孩子的麻烦，全社户户社员都很满意。　（本报驻郑州记者）
