Fushun Tiger Tail Mine No. 6 Coal Mining District Completes First Half Production Plan Ahead of Schedule

    The workers of the No. 6 Coal Mining District of the Fushun Tiger Tail Mine completed the state plan for raw coal production for the first half of the year more than a month ahead of schedule on May 21. When the news of their production victory spread throughout the mine, workers from other units even greeted them out of the mine with gongs and drums. Now, they are preparing to increase raw coal production by another 30,000 tons for the country before the end of June, as a gift to the Party's birthday - "July 1st."
    The No. 6 Coal Mining District of the Tiger Tail Mine conscientiously promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet "intensive pillar support" and eliminated "roof collapse" accidents. Yang Baojiang, a coal mining expert, and his Third Coal Mining Team conscientiously promoted the advanced experience of drilling deep holes of 1.7 meters, which enabled the average progress of the entire district to reach more than 3.5 meters, and overproduced 210 tons of raw coal. This enabled the entire district to complete the raw coal production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. (Tong Chaorong)

    抚顺老虎台矿第六采煤区提前完成上半年生产计划
    抚顺市老虎台矿第六采煤区职工，在五月二十一日提前一个多月完成了上半年原煤生产的国家计划。当他们的生产捷报在全矿传开的时候，别的单位的职工曾经打着锣鼓去迎接他们升井。现在，他们正准备在六月底以前再为国家增产三万吨原煤，作为给党的生日——“七一”的献礼。
    老虎台矿第六采煤区认真推广了苏联“密集支柱”的先进经验，消灭了“冒顶”事故。采煤能手杨宝江所在的第三采煤班认真地推广了一点七公尺的深打眼的先进经验，使全区平均进度达到三点五公尺以上，超额生产原煤二百一十吨。这样就使全区提前完成了上半年的原煤生产计划。  （佟朝荣）
