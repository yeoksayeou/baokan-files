Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo's Speech

Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is a great honor for Mrs. Sastroamidjojo and myself to welcome all of you, the Premier of the People's Republic of China, distinguished government officials, distinguished leaders of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, diplomatic envoys, and all the distinguished guests present tonight.

Although we are not yet leaving Chinese territory and will still enjoy the hospitality of the Chinese government and people for a few more days, at this moment, on the eve of our departure from the capital of the People's Republic of China, the great ancient city of Beijing, please allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the Chinese government and people. I also express my gratitude on behalf of Mrs. Sastroamidjojo and our entire entourage for your warm hospitality.

The spontaneous and enthusiastic welcome we saw everywhere, from leaders and officials in the reception rooms, students in the universities, to workers and farmers in the streets, factories, and rural areas, all demonstrate the sincere desire of the new China to establish the closest relations with the government and people of Indonesia.

In fact, when I left Indonesia, I thought the purpose of my visit should be twofold: first, to strengthen the existing friendship between our two countries, and second, to promote general international understanding to establish world peace. These ideas are nothing more than a true expression of the spirit within the scope of the Bandung Conference, which was attended by twenty-nine Asian and African countries.

Regarding the first purpose of my visit, as I have already mentioned, the public's welcome is a strong proof of our existing friendship and the desire to strengthen this friendship in the future. Moreover, in the discussions between the Chinese Premier and myself personally, agreement has been reached on the basic principles of our trade and cultural relations, and some issues regarding the implementation of the dual nationality treaty have been studied and mutual understanding has been achieved, so that future difficulties may be avoided or reduced.

In promoting general international cooperation, we also discussed the recent developments in international affairs, especially those related to the security and welfare of our part of the world. In this regard, as with the expression of Indonesia's willingness to help mediate, mutual understanding has been established. We reiterate once again our willingness to do everything in our power to ease tensions existing anywhere and to cooperate in eliminating the remnants of colonialism, one of the serious threats to world peace, by peaceful means.

Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

In the pursuit of peace and comprehensive international cooperation, my visit to China should not be seen as an isolated event. Almost at the same time as my visit to this great country, other leading Asian statesmen are also making significant visits to other parts of the world. Indian Prime Minister Nehru will soon arrive in Moscow and the capitals of Yugoslavia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, on his way to the United States, will also visit Britain, Yugoslavia, and other Western European countries. The simultaneous occurrence of these visits is purely coincidental and has not been pre-arranged in any way. Therefore, all these activities should be seen as a concerted effort by Asian countries and peoples to achieve mutual understanding in the world and cooperation with everyone on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

I know this is a heavy responsibility for all of us, but we should always remember that assuming the responsibility for peace and world cooperation is not only the right of the peoples of Asia and Africa, but also their obligation.

We Asians and Africans believe that following the ten principles stated in the Bandung Declaration is the only chance for humanity to avoid being destroyed by modern civilization and its own creations.

We must promote the spirit of these principles, and we must expand our understanding of the composition of our current world. In addition, in our efforts to eliminate the final discord, we should not only show patience, tolerance, and perseverance, but more importantly, we humans all over the world have our common ties, our common desire for peace and a decent life. If these common ties and common desires are carefully utilized, they will surely help to make our differences secondary.

Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Tomorrow we will leave Beijing to visit other parts of this great and beautiful country. In these days of mine on Chinese soil, I have seen and observed a lot. We have traveled long distances and visited many places. We have had the opportunity to speak to many people in various professions, and wherever we go, the hospitality is always very warm.

We have the opportunity to see the great progress that the new China is making in agriculture, irrigation, light and heavy industry, transportation, science, education, social welfare, and other fields. This progress is transforming a vast country into a great nation.

We are deeply impressed by the spirit of the Chinese people, their willingness to cooperate in well-organized efforts to achieve common goals, and their awareness of participating in great common tasks that benefit everyone. The unity of purpose and action, and the firm determination of the entire nation to eliminate backwardness, are truly worthy of sincere admiration, even though our views on the basic principles of dealing with political and economic issues are different.

In addition, the universal desire for peace is widely expressed by people of all walks of life.

Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

After my visit and discussions, I have no doubt that the relations and cooperation between our two countries will develop in the right direction. Especially after the issue of dual nationality is resolved, the ambiguity and confusion among overseas Chinese can be eliminated, so that Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent can serve the welfare of their new motherland, and choosing Chinese nationality should in no way prevent them from complying with the rules of production and commerce.

Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Four days later, I will bid farewell to you and the hospitable Chinese people.

I wish you, Mr. Premier, and the Chinese people prosperity and happiness. I can assure you that I look forward to our further cooperation, which had a very good start in Bandung and Jakarta, and has continued to develop here in Beijing.

Finally, Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen, please raise your glasses to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong.

### 沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理的讲话

专栏：

    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理的讲话阁下，诸位女士，诸位先生，
    能够欢迎诸位全体，中华人民共和国总理，政府杰出官员，全国人民代表大会常务委员会的杰出领导人员，外交使节，以及今晚到场的所有贵宾，沙斯特罗阿米佐约夫人和我本人都感到莫大的荣幸。
    虽然我们还不离开中国领土，而且还要享受中国政府和人民几天的款待，但是在这个时候，在我们离开中华人民共和国的首都，伟大的古老的北京城的前夕，请允许我对中国政府和人民表示真挚的感谢。我也代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约夫人和我们一行全体人员，对你们给予我们的盛情招待，向你们表示感谢。
    我们在各处，从接待室中的领导人员和官员、大学里的学生，直到街头、工厂和农村中的工人和农民，所看到的自发的热烈欢迎，都证明了新中国要同印度尼西亚政府和人民建立最密切关系的真挚愿望。
    事实上，我在离开印度尼西亚的时候，我想我的访问的目的应有两个，第一是加强我们两国之间现有的友谊，第二是促进一般的国际谅解以建立世界和平。这些想法无非是在有二十九个亚非国家参加的万隆会议范围内的精神的真正表现。
    关于我的访问的第一个目的，像我已经提过的，公众的欢迎是我们现有的友谊及希望在将来加强这种友谊的愿望的一个强有力的证明。而且，在中国总理和我个人进行的讨论中，已就我们的贸易和文化关系的基本原则达成协议，同时就关于执行双重国籍条约方面的一些问题进行了研究并取得了相互的谅解，这样，将来的困难就可能避免或减少。
    在促进一般的国际合作方面，我们也讨论了国际事务的最近发展，特别是与世界上我们这一部分地区的安全和福利有关的发展。对于这一点，就像对于印度尼西亚愿意帮忙进行斡旋的表示一样，已建立了相互的谅解。我们再一次重申，我们愿意尽我们的一切力量来缓和任何地方存在的紧张局势，并进行合作，以和平方法消除作为对世界和平的严重威胁之一的殖民主义的残余。阁下，诸位女士，诸位先生，
    在寻求和平和全面国际合作的过程中，我这次访问中国不应当被看做是一个孤立的事件。几乎就在我访问这个伟大的国家的同时，亚洲的其他首要政治家也在对世界上其他地区进行具有重大意义的访问。印度总理尼赫鲁先生不久将到达莫斯科和南斯拉夫、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的首都，而在前往美国途中的缅甸吴努总理也将访问英国、南斯拉夫和西欧其他国家。这些访问的同时进行纯粹是一种巧合，没有经过任何事先的安排。因此，这一切活动应当被看做是亚洲国家和人民为了在世界上实现相互谅解和在平等互利的基础上同每一个人的合作而作的联合一致的努力。
    我知道这对我们大家来说都是一个沉重的责任，但是我们应当经常记住，担当和平和世界合作的责任不仅是亚非两洲人民的权利，而且是他们的义务。
    我们亚洲和非洲的人相信，遵循万隆宣言中陈述的十项原则，才是人类不致为人类现代文明和人类自己的创造所毁灭的唯一机会。
    我们要发扬这些原则的精神，我们要扩大对我们现今世界组成状况的谅解。此外，我们在争取消除最后的不和的努力中应当不但表现耐心、容忍和坚韧的精神，而且更重要的是，我们全世界的人类有着我们共同的联系，我们对于和平和像样的生活的共同愿望，这些共同的联系和共同的愿望如果加以谨慎的利用，就一定会有助使我们的分歧退居次要地位。阁下，诸位女士，诸位先生，
    明天我们将离开北京，去参观这个伟大而美丽的国家的其他地方。在我在中国国土上的这几天里，我看到和观察了不少东西。我们作了很长距离的旅行，参观了许多地方。我们有机会对各种职业的许多人讲话，而且我们不论到什么地方，招待总是十分热烈的。
    我们获得机会看到新中国在农业、灌溉、轻工业和重工业、交通、科学、教育、社会福利和其他方面正在取得的伟大进展，这些进展把一个幅员广大的国家改造成一个伟大的国家。
    我们对于中国人民的精神、在为了达到共同目标而进行的很有组织的努力中合作的意愿，以及参加对大家有益的伟大的共同工作的觉悟，都有非常深刻的印象。目的和行动的一致、全国人民要消灭落后现象的坚定决心，真正值得真诚的钦慕，虽然我们在处理政治和经济问题的基本原则上的观点是不同的。
    除此之外，各地各阶层人民普遍表现了争取和平的真挚愿望。阁下，诸位女士，诸位先生，
    在我参观和讨论以后，我毫不怀疑，我们两国的关系和合作将朝正确的方向发展。特别是在双重国籍问题解决后，华侨之间的含糊和混乱就可以消除，这样一来，中国血统的印度尼西亚公民可以为他的新的祖国的福利服务，而选择中国国籍丝毫不应当妨碍他们遵守生产和商业方面的规则。阁下，诸位女士，诸位先生，
    四天以后我将向你们和殷勤好客的中国人民告别了。
    我祝您，总理先生，和中国人民繁荣和幸福。我可以向你们保证，我期望着我们的进一步合作，我们这种合作在万隆、雅加达有了十分良好的开端，而在北京这里又继续得到了发展。
    最后，阁下，诸位女士，诸位先生，请你们举杯为毛泽东主席的健康干杯。
