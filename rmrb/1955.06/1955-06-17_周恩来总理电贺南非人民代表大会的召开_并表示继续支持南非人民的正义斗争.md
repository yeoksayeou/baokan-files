Xinhua News Agency, June 16th. The People's Congress jointly initiated by four organizations in the Union of South Africa, the African National Congress, the South African Indian Congress, the South African Congress of Democrats, and the South African Coloured People's Organisation, will be held in South Africa from June 25th to 26th. The Secretariat of the Congress sent a letter to Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China on May 17th, requesting support for the Congress. Premier Zhou Enlai replied to the Secretariat of the Congress on June 15th, congratulating the convening of the People's Congress and expressing continued support for the just struggle of the South African people.

The letter from the Secretariat of the South African People's Congress and Premier Zhou Enlai's reply are as follows:

Secretariat of the South African People's Congress to Premier Zhou Enlai:
To the Premier of the Government of the People's Republic of China,
Dear Sir:

The African National Congress, the South African Indian Congress, the South African Congress of Democrats, and the South African Coloured People's Organisation, have jointly initiated the convening of a congress of representatives elected by the South African people on June 25th and 26th, 1955, to formulate a "Freedom Charter." For the first time in the history of this country, millions of people from all walks of life, regardless of race or color, will be able to participate in formulating a charter of their own rights. Through their elected representatives, they will be able to express their wishes and write down their demands in the Charter. Therefore, these demands will be of great importance to South Africa; they will guide the people in their struggle for a better and happier life.

The Government of the Union of South Africa is not based on the expression of the will of the broad masses of the people. A small section of the people have seized the exclusive right to govern the country. The racial discrimination practiced by successive South African governments has caused indescribable suffering and enslavement to the non-white people. Under the apartheid policy implemented by the current government, oppression is even more blatant. The current government openly and shamelessly advocates universally condemned ideas such as racial supremacy and white superiority.

Persecution on an unprecedented scale has aroused resistance from the people. The resistance movement of 1952, and other actions against the government, have strengthened the liberation front. In recent years, the government, under the pretext of curbing popular resistance, has seized fascist-style powers and turned our country into a police state. Today, people from all walks of life are endangered; because fascism does not even respect the boundaries of race and color.

The trend of the international situation has encouraged us. The decision of the Asian-African Conference on eradicating all traces of racial discrimination is of utmost significance. The warm sympathy and support expressed for the victims of racial discrimination in South Africa has become a source of inspiration and encouragement for our people. Racial discrimination, imperialist domination, and colonial exploitation can no longer be tolerated, and eliminating them from the earth is a noble cause. All countries and good people can and must unite to participate in this cause to end oppression and suffering.

The main task of the People's Congress will be to formulate a "Freedom Charter" for all the people and all ethnic groups of South Africa. A declaration will be issued from this congress, inspiring our people to have new hope for the future. We in South Africa are seeking to consolidate and expand the prospects for democracy and freedom. In this spirit, on the eve of the convening of the People's Congress, we request you, as an important participant in the Asian-African Conference, to send a telegram of support.

Please reply at your earliest convenience and we thank you in advance.

Secretariat of the People's Congress

Premier Zhou Enlai's Reply to the South African People's Congress:
To the Secretariat of the South African People's Congress, forwarded to the People's Congress:

On behalf of the Chinese people, I warmly congratulate the convening of the People's Congress and wish the Congress new achievements in uniting the people of all ethnic groups and strata in South Africa to oppose racial discrimination and strive for freedom and democratic rights.

The Asian-African Conference solemnly condemned colonialism and racial discrimination. The Chinese people will, together with the people of Asian and African countries and the people of the world, continue to support the just struggle of the South African people.

Zhou Enlai
Beijing, June 15, 1955

    周恩来总理电贺南非人民代表大会的召开
    并表示继续支持南非人民的正义斗争
    新华社十六日讯　南非联邦的非洲人国民大会、南非印度人大会、南非民主大会和南非有色人组织等四个团体联合发起召开的人民代表大会将于六月二十五日至二十六日在南非举行。大会秘书处于五月十七日致函中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来，要求对大会予以支持。周恩来总理于六月十五日复电大会秘书处祝贺人民代表大会的召开，并对南非人民的正义斗争表示继续予以支持。
    南非人民代表大会秘书处来函和周恩来总理复电全文如下：
    南非人民代表大会秘书处致周总理函中华人民共和国政府总理亲爱的先生：
    非洲人国民大会、南非印度人大会、南非民主大会和南非有色人组织，联合发起于一九五五年六月二十五日至二十六日召开一个南非人民选举出来的代表大会，来制定一个“自由宪章”。在这个国家的历史上第一次，不分种族或肤色、来自各方面的几百万人民，将能参与制定他们自身权利的宪章。通过他们所选出的代表，他们将能表达他们的愿望并在宪章中写下他们的要求。因此，这些要求对南非将有非常的重要性；它们将引导人民在为争取较好和幸福生活的斗争中前进。
    南非联邦政府并不是以广大人民的意愿的表示为基础的。人民中的一小部分擅取了治理国事的专有权。历届的南非政府所实行的种族歧视，使非白种人民遭到无法形容的痛苦和奴役。在现政府所执行的种族隔离政策之下，压迫更为露骨。现政府竟公然和无耻地主张主宰民族论和白人优越论等人所共愤的思想。
    空前规模的迫害激起了人民的反抗。一九五二年的反抗运动，以及其他反对政府的行动，加强了解放阵线。近年来，政府在遏制人民反抗的借口下，夺取了法西斯式的权力，并把我国变成一个警察国家。今天，各方面的人民都受到了危害；因为法西斯主义甚至不顾种族和肤色的界限的。
    国际形势的趋向鼓舞了我们。亚非会议关于根除种族歧视的一切痕迹的决定是具有极其重大的意义的。对在南非的种族歧视的受害者所表示的热烈同情和支持，成了我国人民激励鼓舞的泉源。种族歧视、帝国主义支配和殖民剥削已不能再予容忍，把它们从地球上消灭掉是一个崇高的事业。一切国家和善良的人们能够而且必须团结起来参加这个事业，以结束压迫和痛苦。
    人民代表大会的主要任务将是为南非全体人民和各族人民制定一个“自由宪章”。从这次大会将发出一项宣言，鼓舞我国人民对未来抱有新的希望。我们在南非的人正谋求巩固并扩大民主和自由的前景。从这种精神出发，我们在人民代表大会召开的前夕请求你，作为亚非会议的一个重要参加者，能来电支持。
    请早日赐复并预致谢意。
                    人民代表大会秘书处
                      一九五五年五月十七日
                          南非约翰内斯堡
    周恩来总理复南非人民代表大会电南非人民代表大会秘书处转人民代表大会：
    我代表中国人民热烈地庆贺人民代表大会的召开，祝贺大会在团结南非各民族各阶层人民反对种族歧视、争取自由和民主权利的斗争中获得新的成就。
    亚非会议严正地谴责了殖民主义和种族歧视。中国人民将同亚非各国和全世界人民一道，继续支持南非人民所进行的正义斗争。
                    周恩来
              一九五五年六月十五日于北京。
