Prime Minister Nehru and his party arrived in Sverdlovsk on the evening of the 17th. The next day, they visited the workshops and workers' residences of the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, and talked with the plant director Glebovsky and the workers. Glebovsky presented Prime Minister Nehru with a model of an automatic mobile excavator that can replace the labor of 7,000 to 10,000 workers, and a photo album illustrating the factory's production situation. When Nehru left, he wrote in the guestbook: "We found the visit to this huge factory very interesting and informative."

On the same day, the guests visited the Ural Geological Museum, which houses the world's largest collection of minerals. Prime Minister Nehru, who studied geology as a student, was very interested in the exhibits. He also expressed his desire to study the well-collected mineral specimens in more detail. Then, the guests went to the Sverdlovsk Young Pioneers Palace, where they visited the various rooms decorated with folk tale themes and the model of an atomic power station built by the Young Pioneers.

On the 19th, Nehru and his party flew from Sverdlovsk to Leningrad. At the airport, he said to the people who came to see him off: I have visited some of your large factories, and we will have dealings with these factories in the future, because these factories will manufacture a large amount of equipment for India's steel joint venture. I am very grateful for your warm hospitality.

After arriving in Leningrad, Prime Minister Nehru and his party visited the State Museum of Antiquities on the afternoon of the 19th. When Nehru visited the museum's exhibition hall of Indian culture and art from the 17th to the 20th centuries, Soviet scientist Grek welcomed the guests in Hindi.

    新华社二十日讯  据塔斯社消息：印度共和国总理尼赫鲁连日在斯维德洛夫斯克和列宁格勒参观访问。
    尼赫鲁总理等于十七日晚到达斯维德洛夫斯克。第二天访问了乌拉尔重型机器制造厂各车间和工人住宅，同工厂厂长格列鲍夫斯基和工人交谈。格列鲍夫斯基送给尼赫鲁总理一个可以代替七千到一万工人的劳动的自动移动挖掘机的模型和说明工厂生产情况的照片册。尼赫鲁离开时在留言簿上写道：“我们认为参观这个巨大的工厂是非常有兴趣和有教益的。”
    同日，客人们前往乌拉尔地质博物馆参观了世界上最大量的矿物收藏。曾在学生时代学过地质学的尼赫鲁总理对这里的展品感到莫大的兴趣。他并表示想对这里收集得很好的矿物标本进行更仔细的研究。接着客人们前往斯维德洛夫斯克少年先锋宫，参观了那里按照民间故事主题装饰的各个房间和少先队员们建筑的原子电力站的模型。
