    A batch of 542 construction workers, the first group from Jinan City to participate in the construction of Lanzhou, arrived in Lanzhou on May 29th. Responsible persons from the Gansu Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau and other units, along with representatives of construction workers, welcomed them at the station. On the evening of the 30th, the Gansu Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, the Gansu Provincial Labor Bureau, and four other units jointly held a welcoming meeting. They have now taken up their posts.

    The vast majority of these workers who have come to Lanzhou to participate in key construction projects are young and middle-aged people who have long been engaged in construction work in Jinan City. Before their departure, the Jinan Municipal Labor Bureau and other units helped them solve many personal problems and held a send-off meeting for them.

    济南一批建筑工人到达兰州
    到兰州参加建设的济南市的第一批建筑工人五百四十二人，在五月二十九日到达兰州。甘肃省建筑工程局等单位的负责人和建筑工人代表到车站欢迎。三十日晚，甘肃省建筑工程局、甘肃省劳动局等六个单位联合举行了欢迎大会。现在，他们已走上工作岗位。
    这一批到兰州参加重点建设的工人，绝大多数是青壮年，他们在济南市曾经长期从事建筑工作。他们出发以前，济南市劳动局等单位曾经帮助他们解决了许多切身问题，并曾开会欢送他们。
