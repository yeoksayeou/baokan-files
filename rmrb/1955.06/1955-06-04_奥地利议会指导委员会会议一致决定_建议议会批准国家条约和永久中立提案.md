Xinhua News Agency report: The Austrian Parliamentary Steering Committee held a meeting on June 1st to discuss the full text of the Austrian State Treaty and the joint proposal on Austria's permanent neutrality put forward on May 25th by the chairmen of the four parliamentary groups - the People's Party, the Socialist Party, the League of Independents, and the Austrian People's Opposition League.

Austrian Chancellor Raab, who attended the meeting, said in his speech: "We can heartily welcome the signing of the State Treaty. And I want to emphasize that voting in favor of the State Treaty means taking responsibility for every chapter in the treaty. When voting on this issue, each member of parliament must indicate whether they agree with all the articles and every chapter of the treaty." Raab then pointed out that the State Treaty is a contribution to easing international tensions. He said: "We advocate neutrality. We are now a neutral country like Switzerland. Parliament will be able to formulate a corresponding constitution. Neutrality should become the principle of Austria's policy in the future."

After discussing the State Treaty article by article, the Steering Committee unanimously decided to recommend that Parliament approve the full text of the treaty in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Constitution. Subsequently, the Parliamentary Steering Committee began to discuss the joint proposal of the chairmen of the four parliamentary groups on Austria's permanent neutrality. The Steering Committee unanimously decided to recommend that Parliament adopt this proposal.

Parliament will meet on June 7 (National Council) and June 8 (Federal Council) to discuss and approve the full text of the State Treaty and the proposals of the chairmen of the four parliamentary groups.

Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd, Vienna Dispatch from TASS, June 2nd: Koplenig, chairman of the parliamentary group of the Austrian People's Opposition League, issued a statement regarding the decision passed by the Parliamentary Steering Committee on the 1st, recommending that Parliament approve the Austrian State Treaty and adopt the proposal on Austria's permanent neutralization put forward by the chairmen of the four parliamentary groups.

The statement said: The members of the Austrian People's Opposition League were elected based on a campaign platform that called for the establishment of Austria's neutrality. Therefore, they are satisfied to welcome the current development. Austria's non-participation in any military alliances and treaties, and its pursuit of an independent and neutral policy, can save our country and our people from being involved in international conflicts and disputes.

The statement said: After Austria declares a policy of neutrality, it will, in accordance with the will of the people, guarantee to coexist peacefully with all nations and promote the consolidation of peace in Europe. For many years, our people have been looking forward to the signing of a state treaty and guaranteeing national independence. Now this desire has been realized, and we are convinced that from now on, our people will safeguard our national sovereignty and neutrality to promote the cause of consolidating peace.

    奥地利议会指导委员会会议一致决定
    建议议会批准国家条约和永久中立提案
    据新华社讯　奥地利议会指导委员会六月一日举行会议，讨论奥地利国家条约全文和四个议会党团——人民党、社会党、独立者联盟和奥地利人民反对派联盟——主席五月二十五日提出的关于奥地利永久中立的联合提案。
    出席会议的奥地利总理拉布发言说：“我们可以衷心地欢迎国家条约的签订。而我要着重指出，投票赞成国家条约就意味着对条约中的每一个章节负责。在就这一问题表决时，每一个议员都要表示是否同意条约中的所有条文和每一章节。”拉布接着指出，国家条约对于缓和国际紧张局势是一个贡献。他说：“我们主张中立。我们现在已经是像瑞士那样一个中立国家。议会将有可能制定一部相应的宪法。中立应当成为今后奥地利政策的原则。”
    指导委员会在逐条讨论了国家条约之后，一致决定建议议会按照宪法规定的手续批准条约全文。接着，议会指导委员会开始讨论四个议会党团主席关于奥地利永久中立的联合提案。指导委员会一致决定建议议会采纳这一建议。
    议会将在六月七日（国民院）和八日（联邦院）开会讨论并批准国家条约全文和四个议会党团主席的提案。
    新华社三日讯　据塔斯社维也纳二日讯：奥地利人民反对派联盟的议会党团主席柯普勒尼希就议会指导委员会一日通过关于建议议会批准奥地利国家条约以及采纳四个议会党团主席提出的关于奥地利永久中立化的提案的决定，发表了一项声明。
    声明说：奥地利人民反对派联盟的议员是根据要求建立奥地利中立的竞选纲领而当选的。因此，他们满意地欢迎目前局势的发展。奥地利不参加任何军事同盟和条约、奉行独立和中立的政策，就能使我国和我国人民免于卷入国际冲突和纠纷中。
    声明说：奥地利在宣布中立政策后，根据人民的意志将保证同所有各国人民友好共处和促进欧洲和平的巩固。许多年来我国人民就期待着签订国家条约和获得国家独立的保障。现在这种愿望已经实现了，我们确信：从今以后，我国人民将维护我们国家的主权和中立以促进巩固和平的事业。
