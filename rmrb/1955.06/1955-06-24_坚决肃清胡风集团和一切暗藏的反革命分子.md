**Resolutely Eliminate the Hu Feng Group and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionaries**

**Learning from the Hu Feng Incident**

**He Xiangning**

From the three batches of materials published in the "People's Daily" about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, it is clear that this group of hidden counter-revolutionaries is extremely cunning and vicious. After reading these three batches of materials, I am extremely angry. I demand the severe suppression of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a vicious enemy of our entire nation. Open enemies who commit arson and murder are easy to identify, but hidden counter-revolutionaries are more difficult to detect. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a group of hidden counter-revolutionaries. However, falsehoods are eventually exposed, and the people's eyes are sharp. The evil activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group have finally been exposed. Hu Feng elements have infiltrated many departments of our revolutionary forces, including the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, the Democratic Parties, and various government agencies and schools. The Hu Feng incident has given us a serious lesson. In the future, our entire nation must be even more vigilant, keep our eyes open, and be clear-headed to further expose and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, ensuring the success of our socialist construction.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, our country has achieved great success in recent years. Many foreign friends who have visited our country have also praised it. The vast majority of overseas Chinese have a correct understanding of our country's progress. However, overseas, many imperialist lackeys and members of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique have been continuously spreading rumors and slandering us, trying to sow discord between overseas Chinese and their motherland. Therefore, millions of overseas Chinese who love their country should also learn from the Hu Feng incident, strengthen unity, and be vigilant, not giving the imperialist lackeys any opportunity to exploit, and smashing all slander and sabotage against our great motherland.

**The Essence of Hu Feng**

**Huang Yanpei**

I have never met Hu Feng. Hu Feng's original name is Zhang Guangren, and I have never met him either.

When the Hu Feng incident was first reported in the newspapers, I, like some others, thought it was a matter of ideology. Later, as I carefully read batch after batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group published in the newspapers, totaling 169 letters, I finally realized that this is not an ideological issue but a political issue with a huge background. It involuntarily aroused my intense hatred and anger.

Now I understand. After reading the article published by the "Hubei Daily" reporter exposing Hu Feng's consistent counter-revolutionary stance towards the landlord family, I realized that Hu Feng was originally a member of a bloodthirsty, stinking, and extremely evil landlord family that engaged in usury, raped countless women, ruthlessly exploited farmers, miners, and fishermen, beat farmers to death, killed farmers, raped the wives of poor farmers, and seized public fields and lakes. It is not surprising that Hu Feng engaged in such wicked deeds, for this is the essence of Hu Feng.

The evil activities of counter-revolutionaries are varied. They exploit human psychological weaknesses; people dislike ugliness, so they disguise themselves as monsters to frighten people; people love beauty, so they disguise themselves as beauties to seduce people. The latter is more cunning and vicious. The cunning and vicious Hu Feng is of the latter type. Hu Feng knew that Marxism-Leninism was gaining faith among the people, and that this faith was growing stronger every day, so he donned the cloak of Marxism-Leninism. He did not expect that Marxism-Leninism, in the hands of the extremely evil Hu Feng, would be used to deceive those who do not understand it and those who want to understand it.

Hu Feng's tactics are those of a "two-faced" person, engaging in "heart-digging warfare." Hu Feng's strategy sometimes shifts from attack to retreat, seeking "rebirth in endurance." Hu Feng is good at using the strategy of "Monkey King entering the belly" to infiltrate the Party. However, no matter how cunning and vicious Hu Feng is, today, under the intense sunlight and the angry gaze of millions of people, all his monstrous forms have been completely exposed.

The Hu Feng incident, as it has developed to this day, must see the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng dealt with according to law, and the Hu Feng elements dealt with according to law; for the remaining hidden Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group members, a thorough search must be conducted in all aspects to dig them out as much as possible, not letting a single one escape.

Everyone must be more vigilant in the future, treating the Hu Feng incident as a profound educational material, learning to distinguish between hypocrisy, eliminating Hu Feng-like reactionaries, and preventing all hidden reactionaries. Of course, we cannot wrong a good person, but we must not let a single bad person go.

I personally would like to propose one point: Hu Feng, having donned the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, may have deceived some young people who believe in Marxism-Leninism and those who are studying it, and who, without cultivating the ability to distinguish between good and bad, true and false, were deceived and dragged in, having some relationship with Hu Feng. Such people, who were deceived but do not want to follow Hu Feng forever, must come forward sincerely and truthfully confess today. As long as they confess voluntarily and honestly, I believe that our people's government, which loves young people and values talent, will give them legal leniency.

**Completely Eliminate the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group**

**Tan Ping Shan**

From the three batches of materials exposed by the "People's Daily" about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, it can be fully proven that the Hu Feng group is an enemy that has been organized, planned, and hidden within the revolutionary camp for a long time, engaging in counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. Their despicable, shameless, cunning, and vicious methods have aroused the extreme anger of the entire nation. I fully agree with thoroughly exposing and settling the accounts of the Hu Feng group's harmful actions against the people and the nation, and revoking the positions of Hu Feng and other ringleaders in state agencies and other work departments, and severely punishing their counter-revolutionary crimes according to law.

The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a great victory in our class struggle. This incident proves that in the process of our country's socialist industrialization and the construction of socialism, class struggle has become even more acute and complex. Counter-revolutionaries will not give up easily; they will use every means to sabotage our revolutionary cause. However, we have a powerful revolutionary force and will definitely smash all counter-revolutionary conspiracies. We should learn from this incident, never be complacent, and must solidly arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism, continuously improve our political and ideological level and revolutionary vigilance, draw a clear line between enemies and ourselves, and resolutely eliminate the Hu Feng group and all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

**It is Necessary to Thoroughly Settle the Accounts of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group's Crimes**

**Xiong Kewu**

Exposing the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a sharp struggle to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries. We must learn from this serious incident and always be vigilant politically.

The three batches of materials published by the "People's Daily" fully prove that Hu Feng and the members of the Hu Feng group have long pretended to be revolutionary, engaging in the most cunning sabotage of the Party-led literary movement and the entire revolutionary cause, and are our most vicious political enemies. Hu Feng and his followers adopted a hidden approach to infiltrate various fronts of our revolutionary camp, even mixing into the Communist Party to engage in anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. This shows that the Hu Feng group is not just a small group of ambitious individuals in the cultural circle but is a well-organized, well-planned spy organization of counter-revolutionaries, traitors, and spies. The political background of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is very clear. Many key members of Hu Feng and his group have long been loyal lackeys of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, having close ties with them, and collaborating with them to engage in criminal activities to sabotage the people's regime.

This shocking reactionary group has been hiding within the people's camp, engaging in activities harmful to the state and the people for a long time before being exposed, which shows that our political vigilance is far from sufficient. Hu Feng, disguised as a progressive, deceived the nation into obtaining a seat in the National People's Congress. I and he belong to the Sichuan delegation, and I am particularly angry about the criminal acts of this cunning and vicious counter-revolutionary. I firmly support the suggestion of people from all walks of life nationwide to immediately revoke his status as a National People's Congress representative and impose severe legal sanctions on him. We should also continue to fight relentlessly to thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

Exposing the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and removing this batch of counter-revolutionaries from the people's ranks is a major victory for the Chinese people in their struggle against internal and external enemies under the leadership of the Communist Party. However, as our people's democratic regime becomes stronger and our construction projects advance rapidly, internal and external enemies will inevitably become more jealous and hateful of us, continuing to engage in open or hidden sabotage activities against us. Therefore, we must strengthen political learning, improve revolutionary vigilance, strictly distinguish between enemies and ourselves, and learn deeply from the incident of settling the accounts of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group's crimes.

**Actively Participate in the Struggle Against the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group**

**Zhao Puchu**

Regarding the Hu Feng incident, we Buddhists initially thought it was just a problem in the literary circle, unrelated to the religious circle, so we paid little attention. It was not until the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group were published in the "People's Daily" that we were shocked and reminded: the Hu Feng problem, in terms of its nature, is by no means just an ideological problem; in terms of its scope, it is by no means just a problem within the literary circle, but a serious political incident. We Buddhists, like people from other strata, must not adopt a bystander attitude and stay out of the matter.

From Hu Feng's letters and the materials exposed from various aspects, it is clear that Hu Feng is a resolute counter-revolutionary who has always been hostile to the Party and the people. The methods he adopted are even more vicious than those of open enemies. For many years, he donned the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, mixing into the revolutionary ranks, using the tactic he himself called "Monkey King entering the belly" to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

This situation is like a story in the Buddhist scriptures: the demon king told the Buddha, "In the future, my descendants will wear your clothes and destroy your teachings." Hu Feng is exactly the demon who wears the clothes of revolutionaries to destroy the revolutionary cause.

The third batch of materials published in the "People's Daily" on June 10 further proves that Hu Feng and his gang have close ties with the imperialist Kuomintang spy agencies. This cannot but make us extremely angry. We Buddhists firmly advocate that Hu Feng and his gang of counter-revolutionaries be punished according to law.

The Hu Feng incident has greatly educated us religious people. It has corrected our attitude of not caring about politics and taught us to be vigilant at all times, not only to guard against open enemies but also to guard against hidden enemies, to expose their disguises in time, and to eliminate them, not allowing them to harm the people.

Buddhists should fully value this incident and seriously carry out learning to improve their level of understanding, distinguish right from wrong, and distinguish enemies from ourselves, and together with the people of the entire nation, unite more closely around the Party and the government, and in the struggle to defend the motherland's construction and resist internal and external enemies, better fulfill our responsibilities.

**Prevent Counter-Revolutionaries from Infiltrating the Religious Circle**

**Dapu Sheng**

After reading the materials published by the "People's Daily" exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, I was shocked and extremely angry. The Hu Feng group was originally a group of counter-revolutionaries who, under the guise of progress, had long been hiding in various departments of the revolutionary ranks, even infiltrating the Communist Party, carrying out planned and step-by-step conspiratorial activities for their American Chiang Kai-shek masters. Their goal is to sabotage the people's democratic dictatorship, sabotage the democratic united front, sabotage the people's cultural undertakings, sabotage the motherland's economic construction, sabotage socialist transformation, and collaborate with the dying struggles of the Chiang bandits in Taiwan, in the vain hope of achieving their counter-revolutionary restoration through internal and external coordination.

The Chinese people who believe in Islam have long suffered oppression, insults, massacres, and trampling in the areas of nationality and religion by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The ferocious faces of the reactionaries are forever etched in our hearts. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is the mortal enemy of our people of all ethnic groups. I, on behalf of the Chinese Islamic religious circle, firmly support the thorough investigation of the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and the severe punishment according to law. We religious circle members must strengthen unity, improve vigilance, prevent Hu Feng counter-revolutionaries and all counter-revolutionaries like Hu Feng from infiltrating the religious circle, and fight to thoroughly and completely eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionaries.

I hate this group of counter-revolutionary black gangsters to the core!

**Shi Xiaomei**

In the past, I thought that Hu Feng and his group were just some unscrupulous writers who had nothing to do with us workers. However, when I heard someone read the materials published by the "People's Daily," especially the third batch, I realized that this group of people was originally a spy group of the American Chiang bandits. They wanted to overthrow the people's democratic regime led by the working class and wanted the Kuomintang reactionaries to oppress us again. I hate these heartless and treacherous counter-revolutionaries to the core!

I am a 66-year-old old worker who retired this year and am enjoying a happy retirement. However, I will never forget the bitter days of the past. During the Great Revolution, for the liberation of the people of the entire nation, countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives, not hesitating to give up their own lives. At that time, the Chiang bandits tried to capture me several times, and I had to hide and move secretly, engaging in underground activities. My eldest son, Shi Liangcai, was killed by the Chiang bandits on September 3, 1928, along with many revolutionary martyrs; he was still a young man at the time of his sacrifice.

Today's revolutionary victory was won by the blood of countless martyrs. Now, the enemies with guns have been defeated by us; however, the hidden enemies are using even more vicious means, trying every possible way to sabotage our socialist cause and our happy life. We will not allow this. I demand that the government completely eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. We, the entire working class, should actively respond to the Party's call, participate in this struggle, and through this struggle, greatly improve our revolutionary vigilance, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, defend the fruits of victory, defend our socialist construction cause, and avenge the martyrs!

**The Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group is the Mortal Enemy of Our People**

**Guo Yuren**

I am a laboring farmer and a representative of the National People's Congress. When I saw the "People's Daily" continuously expose the counter-revolutionary, anti-Party, and anti-people crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, I was extremely angry. I fully support the decision of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers' Association to expel Hu Feng from the organization and remove all his positions. As a representative of the National People's Congress, I request the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to revoke Hu Feng's status as a representative of the National People's Congress according to the constitution and request the Supreme People's Procuratorate to handle the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group as necessary. From the three batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, it is clear that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has close ties with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and is the mortal enemy of the people. For more than twenty years, he has adopted the most cunning and treacherous attitude towards the Party, strongly resisting and sabotaging, using every means to expand his anti-Party and anti-people activities, seriously harming the interests of the people and sabotaging the socialist construction cause. He is dissatisfied with the happy socialist society built by the laboring people under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and hates the victory achieved by our struggle. He has long been hiding in the revolutionary ranks, engaging in anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is the mortal enemy of our entire nation, so we must resolutely and thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and consolidate our revolutionary victory. Today, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been exposed by the people, which is a great victory for our socialist construction cause. It once again shows the complexity and sharpness of class struggle in the transitional period. All of us laboring people must mobilize together, improve revolutionary vigilance, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, and eliminate all hidden enemies. We actively respond to the call of the Party and the people's government, strive to do a good job in agricultural production cooperatives, increase production, seriously implement the Party's class line, improve the ideological awareness and revolutionary vigilance of the members, and prevent the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries.

**Eliminate All Hidden Enemies**

**Gong Zizhi**

The third batch of materials published by the "People's Daily" about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group further proves that this group has long had close ties with the imperialist Kuomintang spy agencies, consistently anti-Party and anti-people, and are loyal lackeys of the Chiang bandits. They have long disguised themselves as progressives, secretly engaging in sabotage activities. Seeing the great victories of New China today, to collaborate with their masters who fled to Taiwan and still dream of restoration, their sabotage and conspiracies have become even more active, and their methods have become even more cunning and vicious. The reactionary face and political background of Hu Feng, which have long been hidden, have now been exposed, which further arouses our extreme anger. We, together with the people of the entire nation, condemn and demand the timely and legal punishment of Hu Feng, the thorough smashing of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, and the timely identification and elimination of all hidden counter-revolutionaries to defend our revolutionary victory and socialist construction.

The characteristic of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary activities is his skill in disguise and concealment, his skill in playing the double-faced and treacherous role of sabotaging the revolution. He has long used his disguised progressive side to cover up his side that sabotages the revolution. Due to the continuous exposure of materials, facts have fully proven that the reactionary literary theories that Hu Feng has been spreading for many years are exactly what he arrogantly intends to expand his influence to achieve the reactionary effect of sabotaging the revolution. He is using literary theories as a cover to disguise his spy activities, serving the evil rule of the Americans and the Chiang Kai-shek. Such hidden enemies are more cunning than those who openly commit arson and murder. However, the people's eyes are sharp. Through criticism and exposure, stripping off his disguise, the result is that his ugly true form is completely revealed. This shows that as the class struggle intensifies and deepens today, the die-hard elements of the class that is to be eliminated will inevitably make their last desperate struggles before their demise. It also shows that such resisting reactionaries, no matter how they come openly or secretly, will ultimately not escape the grasp of the people and will inevitably be crushed by the wheels of history. The Hu Feng incident is a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionaries and another great victory for our socialist revolutionary cause.

From the Hu Feng incident, we should draw profound lessons: our revolutionary vigilance must be further improved, and our political sense must be further strengthened. We cannot see only the progressive side of people like Hu Feng and not see the side that sabotages the revolution. We should not be vigilant only when the enemy sabotages and then become complacent when the enemy hides. In fact, the enemy is not to be feared; what is truly to be feared is our own complacency. If the Hu Feng incident is not exposed in time, allowing him to continue his rampage, allowing him to "break through the gap" and "probe the direction" to engage in secret subversive activities, it will cause great damage to the revolutionary cause of the Party and the people. The harm of the hidden enemy's sabotage activities is so serious. Improving vigilance, strengthening our sense of smell, and further distinguishing between enemies and ourselves politically, organizationally, and ideologically to eliminate all hidden enemies is completely necessary and of great significance in action. This is a fierce and profound class struggle on the political and ideological frontlines for the people of the entire nation. We must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, strengthen unity, strive to reform ourselves, and fight to thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and resolutely strike all hidden counter-revolutionaries, to further establish the dialectical materialist worldview of the working class, deeply criticize the reactionary idealist worldview of the bourgeoisie!

**Lessons from the Hu Feng Incident**

**Hu Zhaoheng**

The struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is underway, and I, during this period, am working in the heart of the Great Xing'an Mountains, but I am participating in the struggle with the same spirit as when the country was liberated and I participated in the various battles in Northeast China.

This is the Party's call! This is a revolutionary task! This is in the fundamental interests of the state and the people!

Against the Hu Feng group and similar groups of "wolves in sheep's clothing," we must resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate them from the revolutionary ranks and give them the punishment they deserve. However, the question arises: why have we "slept with the tiger" for so long? Now, is there still a tiger lurking by our bedside? All revolutionaries must learn from this incident.

There are many lessons, but the most important one is: the class struggle in the transitional period is more acute and complex, and we must always maintain revolutionary vigilance. Revolutionary vigilance can only be tempered by actively participating in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and gradually improving. All revolutionaries must take action and participate in this great struggle.

We must examine ourselves. The Hu Feng incident teaches us: political complacency, liberalism, and the lack of thoroughness in ideological struggle are the conditions that allow enemies like the Hu Feng group to hide and operate within revolutionary organizations for a long time. Conducting serious self-criticism and overcoming these shortcomings is completely necessary.

To carry the struggle to the end, we cannot be satisfied with the current achievements. Taking the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as an example, in recent years, we have also struggled against similar literary thoughts of the Hu Feng group to defend the Party's literary policy. All our Party, government, military, and civilian organizations are strongholds and fortresses of the socialist revolution and must be pure and solid, not allowing the enemy to seize them from within. All revolutionaries and those who truly sympathize with the revolution should unite, sweep away complacency, improve vigilance, and, like the central leadership of the nation's struggle against the Hu Feng group, carry out the struggle step by step in various regions, giving the enemy a crushing blow, and completely eliminating them.

Finally, the lesson we must remember is not to neglect the struggle on the theoretical front and not to separate theoretical struggle from political struggle. Marxism-Leninism is our invincible weapon. The Hu Feng group was first broken and defeated on this front, and thus completely collapsed. Shouldn't comrades who neglect theoretical learning learn some basic knowledge of Marxism from this struggle?

**Never Rest Until Complete Victory**

**Hu Ke**

The counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng group are being continuously exposed, and we are beginning to see their true colors. Those who once disguised themselves as having some "revolutionary spirit and stance of the petty bourgeoisie," even deceiving the title of Party member, were originally a group of despicable, cunning, and vicious American Chiang spies!

When Hu Feng sensed that the situation was not good, he sent his instructions to his henchmen, Zhang Zhongxiao and others, telling them to look at what "should not be touched" in his fake confession. What these people considered "most untouchable" seems to be what the "People's Daily" has published in these batches of materials, especially the third batch of materials that "touch" their true colors? Indeed, if the bandits themselves reveal their identity, background, and who their masters are, how could they "seek rebirth in endurance"? The Party and the people are not as Hu Feng hoped, also "blinded by optimism," and relaxed the pursuit of counter-revolutionaries. No! What the bandits consider "most untouchable" is exactly what we consider must be "touched"! We will continue to "touch" this group of bandits' entire conspiracy! Their entire root! Their entire roster!

Reading the third batch of materials "touching" these filthy deeds, one truly has to "endure physiological disgust." The secret letters of this group of bandits make us smell the bloody and pus-like odors emanating from the "Joint US-China Cooperation Office," "Cave Military University," "Zhong-side," and "Snake's Den." We hear the sound of whips beating prisoners, the sound of spies laughing through their teeth when they are "confident" and "optimistic," the sound of cursing after failing on the mainland, and the sound of plotting to "lay the foundation," "consolidate the base," "probe the direction," and "find the gap" in their conspiratorial activities. These despicable and cunning letters are the most "sincere" "works" of the spy bandits Hu Feng and others! These "sincere" expressions of their ugly and ferocious faces are very likely the materials they prepared to invite rewards when they dream of the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek regime. They reveal the "intentions" of the bandits so "openly"!

These secret letters use all vile words to curse our country, curse our Party, curse the works of our leaders, and hate the social order we have established with our blood. Everything we love and are willing to sacrifice our lives to defend is what they hate to the core. As a citizen, as a revolutionary soldier, as a Party literary worker, I cannot suppress my sense of humiliation, I cannot suppress my anger!

Just by smelling the odors emanating from these secret letters, anyone can immediately distinguish who these people are. They are enemies! They are a group of bandits who are not on the same side as us and are fighting to the death! We are not unfamiliar with these people. What "recovery" and "fall," "national army" and "bandit army," "evil communists," these words are not in the same tune as the vile and filthy propaganda of the Chiang bandits and the Americans? The makers of these goods are not the ones we have dealt with before? The "political workers" of the Chiang bandits who pretended to be dead on the battlefield and then jumped up to shoot, the reactionary officers who tore off their epaulettes to disguise as soldiers and then tried to escape from the group of prisoners, the die-hard spies who fought to the death and refused to surrender, the evil landlords who fled abroad and then led the Chiang bandit army to return to slaughter farmers, are they not the same group?

On the battlefield, during the land reform movement, we were highly vigilant against such enemies. When we achieved victory and began construction, this group of bandits took advantage of the arrogance and complacency of some of our comrades, the negligence of some of our comrades who focused on their work and forgot politics, and acted recklessly! This group of bandits wore official uniforms, used the cover of literature, used a few Marxist terms, deceived people's trust, and secretly engaged in the evil deeds of being "liaison officers," "winning over people," gathering intelligence, stealing documents, setting up bases, and collaborating with war conspiracies for the Chiang bandits and American imperialism. For a long time, they engaged in such evil activities, which is a great lesson for us!

We must be a hundred times more vigilant and never be complacent again! To defend the victories we have achieved, for our socialist cause, for the peace of our mothers and children, we must bravely participate in this battle! Eliminate all counter-revolutionaries hiding in the people's ranks! Never rest until complete victory!

**Severely Punish the Enemy**

**Sun Weishi**

The "People's Daily" published the third batch of secret letters of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, proving that the Hu Feng group has close ties with the American Chiang spy agencies. In the past, I only considered them a group of bad eggs in the literary circle, which was truly complacent. We are too kind-hearted, and we must be ruthless towards the enemy—kindness towards the enemy is cruelty towards the revolution! We must resolutely suppress this group of American Chiang spy thugs and not let a single counter-revolutionary slip through the people's net!

The Party and Chairman Mao, through countless hardships, led us to victory. The martyrs' bodies are still warm, and today's free and happy life is so hard to come by! We must improve our vigilance and defend the fruits of our victory. The American Chiang spies want to infiltrate our vitals, disintegrate us, poison us, and carry out the conspiracy to restore the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime. They use two-faced tactics, perform various magical tricks, and put on fake smiles in front of us, and hit us from behind. They hate the revolution, hate the people, hate the Party, and hate our leaders. When the revolution was in a difficult environment, when we retreated from Yan'an, carrying our bags and marching, it was the time when the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was clapping their hands in joy; when the nation was liberated, and the people were celebrating victory, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was secretly gnashing their teeth in hatred. Now, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has revealed their ferocious and despicable true colors in front of the people's magic mirror, and they cannot escape the judgment of the people's law!

In our revolutionary ranks, there are still counter-revolutionaries hiding, and they have no way out except to surrender to the people and honestly confess their problems to the organization. The people's eyes are sharp and will root them out one by one!

**Learn to Identify Counter-Revolutionaries**

**Feng Naichao**

The dark secrets of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group have finally been exposed. They are a group of counter-revolutionaries closely linked with American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. They hate the laboring people and the people's revolutionary cause. They do not want to see a prosperous and happy new China and oppose China's socialist construction and socialist transformation. The three batches of materials strongly prove one thing: counter-revolutionaries disguise themselves as revolutionaries and infiltrate the revolutionary ranks to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. These facts give us a wake-up call: "We cannot be complacent any longer!"

Hu Feng's infiltration into the Chinese revolutionary literary circle is now clear. He wanted to sabotage the relationship between the revolutionary literary circle and the Party. He tried to sow discord between the then leader of the revolutionary literary circle, Mr. Lu Xun, and the Communist Party, to weaken the literary front led by the Party with a relatively large influence. Mr. Lu Xun expressed his pain over the chattering in the literary circle before his death, which was actually the result of Hu Feng's stirring up trouble.

At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the "July" magazine was published in Wuhan. We suggested that Hu Feng abandon the policy of a personal magazine and expand the scope of contributions to unite more writers, which was firmly rejected by him. At that time, we did not see his ulterior motives. Soon, his factional activities attracted the attention of writers. He showed extreme contempt for the popular literature work of the newly established National Writers' Anti-Enemy Association and caused unnecessary disputes. Writers were deceived by Hu Feng's two-faced tactics and welcomed the publication of "July," but Hu Feng never stopped saying that "July" was cold-shouldered or suppressed. I did not understand Hu Feng's actions at that time, but now, with the facts, I know that he was creating divisions.

Some people doubt: revolutionary literary workers have been entangled with Hu Feng for twenty years, why didn't they notice his flaws at all? This, of course, is because we lacked social knowledge and class struggle experience. The counter-revolutionary smell emanating from Hu Feng, we sometimes smelled it, but due to complacency, we were still deceived by him. Hu Feng once hinted to me that Aling had a connection with a certain aspect of the Party, and this connection was through Hu Feng himself. In this way, Hu Feng dressed Aling up as a "revolutionary" and also dressed himself up as a "revolutionary." Hu Feng was like this and that, and he often played deceitful tricks. The Hu Feng group is a counter-revolutionary gang, and this judgment is one hundred percent correct. They are rich in class struggle experience, while we are "full of bookishness."

We must learn to identify these bandits from this shocking struggle!

**Scientific and Technological Workers Should Actively Participate in the Struggle to Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group**

**Qian Zhonghan**

The third batch of materials published by the "People's Daily" about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group further exposed the counter-revolutionary conspiracies and political background of the Hu Feng group. It turns out that many key members of the Hu Feng group are disguised American Chiang spies who, in collaboration with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, engage in organized and planned sabotage activities. We scientific and technological workers unanimously demand the thorough exposure and smashing of such counter-revolutionary organizations and the severe suppression of the extremely evil counter-revolutionary Hu Feng.

I, like many of my colleagues in the scientific and technological community, have not been sufficiently concerned about the condemnation of the Hu Feng reactionary group in the past, thinking that this is an internal matter of the literary circle and has nothing to do with me; even after seeing Hu Feng's anti-Party literary manifesto, I still did not feel the counter-revolutionary political intentions behind it. This fully exposes our political complacency and dull sense of smell!

We scientific and technological workers should stand up and actively participate in the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. First, the matter is now clear: this is not a matter of literary ideology but a serious struggle against a counter-revolutionary group closely linked with American imperialism and the Kuomintang spy agencies. Moreover, due to our low vigilance, the matter has developed to such a serious extent. These hidden counter-revolutionaries have infiltrated our Party and state agencies, certain schools, and mass organizations, and are recklessly sabotaging our revolutionary cause. Although, due to the strength of the Party and the awakening of the people, these hidden counter-revolutionaries have finally been exposed by us, we must not be complacent again. In addition to resolutely investigating and eliminating these poisonous snakes and ferocious beasts, we must not forget the reality of the sharp and complex class struggle in the imperialist countries and the transitional period, and we must maintain constant high vigilance against all disguised counter-revolutionary activities.

Second, facts have proven: the objects that Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group members try to win over and exploit are mostly those small-bourgeois intellectuals who are not actively seeking self-reform. Hu Feng praises the "spontaneity" of the petty bourgeoisie, which is the same reactionary tactic as the "white paper" of American imperialism hoping that "individual freedom-loving people" can play an "independent" role in the new China after liberation. Therefore, in all intellectuals—including scientific and technological workers—struggling against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is of great significance. We must thoroughly investigate the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng and other hidden counter-revolutionaries.

Finally, unlike the reactionary scholars in the current imperialist countries, Hu Feng uses the cloak of revolution and progress to hide his extremely reactionary idealist theories and counter-revolutionary conspiracies. Hu Feng uses the distortion of Marxism to oppose Marxism and the revolution. This approach can have a great misleading effect on the backward part of the petty bourgeoisie intellectuals. Therefore, on the one hand, we must organizationally smash the Hu Feng reactionary group; on the other hand, in this struggle, we must seriously study Marxism and strive to criticize the bourgeois idealist thoughts in our own field of science, so that we can distinguish true and false Marxism in various specific issues, and block all loopholes in theory and academia to prevent being fooled by counter-revolutionaries in these issues. This is of great significance to our own reform and the socialist construction cause of the state.

**Do Not Give Hidden Counter-Revolutionaries Any Opportunity**

**Zhu Yan**

The "People's Daily" continuously published the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, fully proving that the Hu Feng group is the most cunning and vicious counter-revolutionaries. They use extremely despicable and cunning two-faced tactics, infiltrating our government agencies, educational institutions, troops, newspapers, factories, unions, and Party organizations, engaging in planned and organized sabotage of the people's revolutionary cause, arousing my uncontrollable anger!

Before the three batches of materials were published, I, with dull political senses, still naively thought that the Hu Feng problem was just a matter of literary ideology. Little did I know that in today's China, where socialist construction is increasingly victorious, everyone is joyful, while the Hu Feng group is so bitterly hating the Party, the revolutionary regime, and even everyone? Now I have realized that many key members of the Hu Feng group have had close ties with the American Chiang spy agencies since a long time ago. They are loyal lackeys of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, hiding within the people's revolutionary ranks, constantly seizing opportunities to move, to sabotage the people's revolutionary construction cause. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is our most dangerous enemy!

Every one of us, including us medical and pharmaceutical scientific researchers, should learn from the Hu Feng incident, continuously strengthen theoretical learning and ideological tempering, improve political vigilance, and prevent hidden counter-revolutionaries from having any opportunity.

**Resolutely Suppress and Severely Punish the Hu Feng Group**

**Shu Mo**

The "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, exposing the last layer of skin of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. To ask who Hu Feng and the Hu Feng group's masters are, it is very clear: they are the American imperialist lackeys, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan, who cheer for and support them. Because of this, Hu Feng and the Hu Feng group have such deep "hatred" for today's new society, cursing the people's revolutionary regime with vicious words; also because of this, they "hate everything" that fights for the construction of a socialist society under the leadership of the Communist Party. Originally, what they sought was the "greater future," which was the restoration of the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the "demise" of the people's revolutionary regime. They want the Chinese people, who are striving to move towards a happy future every day, to return to the dark age, to become slaves of imperialism again, to live a life of suffering and exploitation again.

As the editorial note of the "People's Daily" says: "They do not understand the laws of the objective world; the methods they use to think are subjective and metaphysical, so their estimates are always wrong." They thought they could make the wheels of history turn back with their "subjective fighting spirit." Wrong! What was "shattered" was not the "iron wall" built by six hundred million people but their "filthy" counter-revolutionary group.

Now it is truly clear. For these counter-revolutionaries, they must be resolutely suppressed and punished according to law. At the same time, we must improve our vigilance, especially in the cultural circle, facing such complex and sharp class struggles, we must not have liberalism and complacency, but must improve our political vigilance a hundredfold, and together with the people of the entire nation, resolutely eliminate the hidden Hu Feng group members and all counter-revolutionaries like the Hu Feng group from our people's ranks.

**Punish the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Group According to Law**

**Letter from 40 people including Guan Zhaozhi and Qi Jingtai from the Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences:** After reading the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we feel extremely angry. These materials fully prove that the Hu Feng group has close ties with imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. We demand that the government severely punish the Hu Feng group members who are stubbornly evil and unrepentant counter-revolutionaries according to law.

We must learn from the Hu Feng incident, strive to study dialectical materialism, criticize bourgeois idealist thoughts, improve political sense, and strengthen revolutionary vigilance. We must also resolutely and thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionaries like the Hu Feng group hiding in our revolutionary ranks to ensure the victory of the great socialist construction cause!

**Letter from Deng Wenlin from the Personnel Department of the Palace Museum, Beijing:** The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is the most vicious and ferocious enemy of the people. It is more treacherous and vicious than those counter-revolutionaries who carry guns and knives.

They tried to use the "tactic of Monkey King entering the belly" to overthrow the people's democratic regime and realize their masters' dream of "restoration" in mainland China.

Now, the true faces of these treacherous and vicious enemies have been exposed. This is a victory for our Party and the people. We demand to continue the victory, thoroughly investigate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, and give firm and severe suppression to the Hu Feng members who have always been enemies of the people and are stubbornly evil and unrepentant!

This incident has educated me. We must improve our vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen political learning, improve political sense, and completely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries in our revolutionary ranks!

**Letter from nine people including Fang Yiju and Lü Yanjie from the Jinxing Chemical Plant, Liaoning Province:** From the third batch of materials exposed by the "People's Daily," it can be seen that Hu Feng has long had close ties with the Kuomintang spy organizations such as the "Central Investigation Bureau" and the "US-China Cooperation Office," plotting and engaging in counter-revolutionary criminal activities. Therefore, Hu Feng is not just an ordinary counter-revolutionary but the most cunning and vicious counter-revolutionary leader.

Although we are engaged in technical work, we must not stand by and watch this political struggle. Participating in this complex and sharp class struggle is everyone's responsibility. We demand the severe punishment of the unrepentant Hu Feng members and the guarantee of the smooth progress of our country's socialist construction cause!

**Letter from seven people including Zhou Ruichang and Ma Huifang from the Jianhua Iron Works, Beijing:** When we finished reading the materials exposed by the "People's Daily" about the Hu Feng group's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities, we were filled with extreme anger.

Hu Feng and his followers are counter-revolutionaries who, under the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, have been hiding in the revolutionary camp.

We must resolutely defend the fruits of the people's victory and absolutely not allow these reactionaries to remain in our ranks.

We demand the severe punishment of Hu Feng according to law.

Title: Letters to the Editor: Expose and Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique

All faculty, staff, and students of the Central Institute of Physical Education wrote: From the three batches of materials published in the "People's Daily" exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we can clearly see that the masterminds behind the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique are imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is extremely fearful and hateful of the revolutionary cause and the victories we have achieved. They infiltrate the Communist Party, government agencies, mass organizations, factories, mines, and schools, steal documents, gather intelligence, recruit members, and establish bases for conspiracy activities, conducting sabotage from within. However, no matter how cunning they are, they have ultimately been exposed by the people.

The counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique against the Party and the people have aroused our extreme anger. We held a general meeting of all faculty, staff, and students and unanimously passed a resolution, demanding that the government severely suppress the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

Through this incident, we have a clearer understanding that class struggle is more acute and complex during the transitional period. We must respond to the Party's and the government's call, actively participate in this battle, and resolutely and thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. We must also strengthen political study, heighten vigilance, and resolutely expel all hidden counter-revolutionaries to consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship, so as to successfully complete socialist construction.

The Secretariat of the Creation Committee of the Chinese Writers' Association wrote: The publication of the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has further exposed the political background and counter-revolutionary conspiracies of these counter-revolutionaries. It turns out that these Hu Feng elements, who are firmly against the Party and the people, are all of dubious origin. As members of the Writers' Association, we were not only unaware of the enemy's activities among us but were also, to varying degrees, deceived and used by the enemy. This is a bitter and painful lesson!

We must turn our anger into the strength of action. On the one hand, we must learn from this struggle, raise our political awareness and sensitivity; on the other hand, we must resolutely stand at the forefront of the struggle, mercilessly expose all enemies, and root out this group of vicious counter-revolutionaries from every dark corner, so that they have no place to hide, to maintain the purity of our revolutionary ranks. Therefore, we propose the following demands:

1. Thoroughly investigate the history and criminal activities of each Hu Feng element, resolutely and thoroughly smash their counter-revolutionary organizations, and not let a single hidden counter-revolutionary escape.

2. Recommend that the Chinese Writers' Association expel the core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, such as Lü Yuan, A Leng, Lu Ling, Lu Dian, and Fang Ran, from the association, and recommend that the court arrest and prosecute all die-hard counter-revolutionaries.

3. Request the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to recommend that the original election unit immediately revoke Hu Feng's status as a representative of the National People's Congress, and request the relevant authorities to give him severe punishment.

The Research Office of the East China Institute of Political Science and Law, including Pan Nianzhi and Shi Guoqiang, wrote: We have once again read with extreme anger the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily." The issue is now clearer. Hu Feng and many key members of the Hu Feng clique, such as A Leng and Lü Yuan, were originally "anti-communist" political workers of the Kuomintang reactionaries, Kuomintang officers, and special agents of the "China-U.S. Cooperation Society." They were "optimistic" about the civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek but showed deep hatred for the new society and the people's revolutionary regime after liberation, "almost hating everyone." This is no surprise.

Today, the truth has been revealed. We demand that the original election unit immediately revoke Hu Feng's status as a representative of the National People's Congress in accordance with the law, and immediately have the judicial authorities severely punish Hu Feng, A Leng, and Lü Yuan, the key counter-revolutionaries, according to the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." At the same time, we also warn all members of the Hu Feng clique to quickly repent and confess their crimes to seek leniency from the people. Under the people's regime, any hidden or open counter-revolutionaries have no other way out except to repent and reform as soon as possible. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a powerful example.

The Finance Department Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee wrote: The three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily" have proven that the Hu Feng clique is a counter-revolutionary organization with close ties to imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, a gang of thugs engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, and the most treacherous and cunning class enemies of the Chinese people. Their crimes cannot but arouse our extreme anger.

The members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, disguised as Marxists, used literature as a cover, infiltrated our agencies, troops, enterprises, and organizations, and some even deceived the title of "Communist Party member." Many key members of the Hu Feng clique have long been united with imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, fiercely attacking the Party, the people, and our revolutionary cause. Their heinous counter-revolutionary crimes must be severely punished by state laws and regulations. We demand the immediate revocation of Hu Feng's status as a representative of the National People's Congress and his arrest and prosecution; at the same time, we demand the thorough elimination of all Hu Feng elements and counter-revolutionaries hidden in our revolutionary ranks, not letting a single one escape.

From the Hu Feng incident, we have further recognized the complexity and acuteness of class struggle during the transitional period. Internal and external enemies will do everything possible to sabotage our revolutionary cause. We must heighten vigilance, expose and report the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique from all sides, and prevent all counter-revolutionaries from infiltrating our ranks. We must contribute all our strength and, together with the people of the entire country, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, fight to the end to defend our revolutionary regime and our free and happy lives.

The Fifth Editorial Department of the People's Literature Publishing House, including Zhao Qifeng, Wang Lijie, and Huang Suqiu, wrote: After reading the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily," we were filled with extreme anger and hatred. The key members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique include imperialist Kuomintang elements, reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and defectors who have betrayed the revolution. For twenty years, they have accumulated countless debts of blood against the people. After liberation, they hid within the people, engaging in extensive activities, attempting to overthrow our revolutionary regime and cause. This is something we cannot tolerate. We demand that the people's government thoroughly investigate the crimes of this group of counter-revolutionaries and punish them according to the law, not letting a single one escape.

Zhang Hongde from the Bohai Engineering Office Longshan Work Area wrote: I am a harbor construction worker. After seeing the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the newspaper, I could not suppress my anger. While the people of the entire country are engaged in the hot and heavy work of socialist construction, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is secretly plotting counter-revolutionary activities. The Hu Feng clique is the public enemy of the Chinese people. Such counter-revolutionaries can only be suppressed and severely punished.

Tan Hongxiang from the Technical School of the Mining Machinery Factory in Shenyang's Da Dong District wrote: On June 10th, I read the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," and I was filled with indignation. Now it is clearer to see: the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique are no different from those of the Kuomintang bandits. They want to overthrow the people's democratic regime, but the power of the people is great, and no matter how cunning they are, they cannot escape the people's net. Now I demand that the government severely punish the key members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique to ensure the smooth progress of our country's socialist construction.

Wang Difan, an electrical technician from the First Power Plant in Taiyuan, wrote: After seeing the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I felt extreme hatred. Some key members of the Hu Feng clique are thorough special agents. They hate the new society and new system and dream of the restoration of the Kuomintang reactionaries, fully exposing their reactionary nature and true face.

From Ou Yangzhuang's letter to Hu Feng, I, as a person of intellectual origin, cannot help but be extremely vigilant. Because a person with weak willpower, a person who commits liberalism, is most likely to fall into the trap of Hu Feng and other counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, in addition to demanding the severe punishment of the Hu Feng clique, I am also determined to study Marxism-Leninism diligently, heighten political vigilance, and expose all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

Li Longhai, a member of the Red Star Collective Farm, wrote: I have continuously read the three batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. Those anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary secret letters have aroused my boundless hatred. After reading these materials, I have fully recognized that Hu Feng, A Leng, and others are loyal dogs of the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek traitors, who have long disguised themselves as revolutionaries and carried out counter-revolutionary activities within the revolutionary ranks, attacking the Party and the people. This is truly despicable. We must be vigilant at all times and resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries.

Yang Yurong from the Chinese Youth Society wrote: The third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique exposed by the "People's Daily" is ironclad evidence of the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique. These materials have exposed their true nature—they are special agents of the U.S.-KMT spy agencies and loyal dogs of Chiang Kai-shek. No wonder they have such great "hatred" for the revolution and "hate" the people's democratic dictatorship, slandering the great campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries as "feudal forces running amok and killing people." They are the original targets of suppression. They are the enemies of the people. I demand the resolute suppression of these counter-revolutionaries!

The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has made me further realize the sharpening and complexity of class struggle during the transitional period. Counter-revolutionaries will use every means to exploit the non-firm elements within the revolutionary ranks, infiltrate our "liver," and carry out sabotage. Therefore, I feel that I should better raise my awareness, not give counter-revolutionaries any opportunity, and resolutely smash all counter-revolutionary activities!

Li Chi from the Democratic Women's Federation of Beijing's Dongsi District wrote: The materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique have been published in three batches, and people can no longer suppress their angry hearts. Today, several housewives and women representatives from the street committee meeting in Dongsi District's Tao Tian Hu Tong, filled with extreme anger and hatred, denounced the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and demanded that the government severely punish these counter-revolutionaries who are firmly against the people, and continue to pursue and thoroughly smash this reactionary clique. Women's representative Zheng Ying (a family member of a coal mine worker) said: "I am just a housewife and have no education. At first, I thought the radio broadcast was about the ideological problems of the literary circle, which had nothing to do with us. Now the facts have shown that the enemy is everywhere. They steal secret documents from the Party, slander the Communist Party, and want to disarm the people ideologically. These counter-revolutionaries want to destroy the happy life of the people. Therefore, this struggle also concerns us women." Deputy Director Li Qianjin said: "Previously, I thought that only armed enemies could destroy us, but Hu Feng, he is more vicious than armed enemies. He is a cunning plotter. We must mobilize our sisters to protect our good days and thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique." Sixty-three-year-old Old Lady Wu Ruilian said: "This incident has educated me. In the future, I will be more vigilant, expose bad people and bad deeds, and work hard on street work."

The Party's wisdom and greatness have timely exposed the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique, which is another great victory of the Party in the construction period. Everyone expressed the need to be a hundred times more vigilant and to bring street women to study hard, raise awareness, so that no enemy can escape the people's judgment.

Liao Boshu from the Central Meteorological Bureau wrote: I am a communications soldier on the meteorological post. Previously, I did not know much about Hu Feng, this cunning and color-changing lizard. But after this study, I was filled with extreme anger. From the three batches of materials exposed by the "People's Daily," we can see how Hu Feng and his henchmen are hostile to the Party and the people; how they use cunning and vicious means to sabotage the revolutionary cause. This is a reflection of the sharpening class struggle in real life.

The counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique have already caused damage to the revolutionary cause and influenced many young people. There are also young people in our meteorological department who have been influenced by members of this clique. Why did Hu Feng advise Lu Ling's wife (Yu Mingying) to continue working in our bureau? It was precisely to expand the "base" into the meteorological field. Due to these relationships, some comrades in our bureau have not been influenced by this clique? There are such comrades who, in the past, enthusiastically admired A Leng's (Yi Men) works and maintained close contact with Lu Ling and others, and even recently wrote letters to comfort these loyal followers of Hu Feng in a sympathetic tone. The facts are too clear. We cannot naively think that the Hu Feng clique will only cause trouble in the "literary world." It also wants to infiltrate various departments to spread its influence. We must be vigilant! Do not let the enemy find any loopholes.

The Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe wrote: We thank the Party for layer by layer peeling off the disguise of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, revealing their true face. They are composed of reactionary officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and defectors as their core members.

In the past, we were indeed too naive and numb. The enemy has already infiltrated our "liver," step by step, layer by layer, organizing, and fiercely launching "heart-digging wars" against us, but we have been unaware of the pain for a long time? The true face of the enemy has been exposed, and we are surprised by our numb political thoughts. Comrades! We must cure this political "influenza," be vigilant against the enemy at all times. We must learn from the Hu Feng incident, study Marxism-Leninism diligently, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary policies, and eliminate the evil tendencies of being detached from politics, detached from struggle, and detached from life. "Learn from one incident, gain one wisdom," we can no longer be politically numb and indifferent.

Cai Zhengmo from the People's Government of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province wrote: The materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique continuously exposed by the "People's Daily" prove that Hu Feng is the enemy of all our ethnic groups. They use all kinds of despicable means, disguised as Marxists-Leninists, infiltrating the revolutionary ranks, carrying out organized and planned counter-revolutionary activities. Their goal is to make all ethnic groups return to the dark days of reactionary rule, which we cannot allow. I am a Korean youth who grew up in the embrace of my motherland, together with the youth of all brotherly ethnic groups, I will participate in the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. We do not allow such counter-revolutionaries to hide in the revolutionary ranks and sabotage our socialist construction. All brotherly ethnic groups must heighten vigilance, for the sake of our beloved motherland and the future happiness, we must unite and fight to the end.

The Literary and Art Workers' Union of Fushun City wrote: After reading the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" published in the "People's Daily," we felt extremely indignant!

The facts are now very clear: many key members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique have long been loyal dogs of the Kuomintang bandits, having close ties with the imperialist Kuomintang spy agencies, long disguised as revolutionaries, hiding within the revolutionary ranks, and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. However, any hidden counter-revolutionaries and counter-revolutionary cliques will inevitably be smashed by the people's mighty hand, and the cause of justice is unbreakable by any enemy.

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident has given us a great lesson. We must be more closely united around the Party, study Marxism-Leninism diligently, be a hundred times more vigilant, and resolutely fight against all hidden enemies.

All workers of the Fengtai Power Plant, Fengtai Railway Bureau, Beijing Railway Bureau wrote: After seeing the materials about the Hu Feng clique's anti-Party and anti-people activities exposed in the newspaper, we knew that they are our class enemies, and we cannot stand on the sidelines of the struggle. We are citizens of the People's Republic of China and members of the working class. We must resolutely participate in this struggle, study politics diligently, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and fight against all counter-revolutionaries.

Renshouqin from the Muslim Association of Jinzhou wrote: The crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique have been exposed to the world. We demand that Hu Feng and the key members of his clique be severely punished according to the law.

The Hu Feng clique is the common enemy of all ethnic groups in the country. We Hui people suffered a life worse than cattle under the rule of the Kuomintang bandits, and we did not even have political status to speak of. Due to the leadership of our savior, Chairman Mao, leading the people of the country to struggle, we were liberated, and we have stood up in politics, economy, and culture. However, the special agents of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits—the Hu Feng clique—want to destroy our happy life. We will not allow it. We must heighten vigilance, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and defend our good life and the great socialist construction cause.

Li Changlai, a clerk from the Chinese Medicinal Materials Company in Bengbu, Anhui Province, wrote: After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I felt extreme anger. I demand that the government severely punish the evil special agent Hu Feng, thoroughly investigate the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and expel the Hu Feng elements who have infiltrated the Party. We must heighten vigilance and thoroughly eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

Wang Sihui from the Foreign Business Department of the People's Bank of China wrote: After reading the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the "People's Daily," I felt extreme hatred.

The materials prove: Hu Feng and the Hu Feng clique serve the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek and imperialism. Hu Feng and the Hu Feng elements have deep hatred for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, dreaming of the "demise" of the revolutionary regime.

The materials prove: the Hu Feng clique is an organized, led, and strategically planned counter-revolutionary clique. Their strategies and tactics are despicable, shameless, and vicious!

The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is another major victory of the Party and the Chinese people in the struggle against the enemy. We should respond to the Party's call, actively participate in this serious political struggle, expose all hidden counter-revolutionaries.

The Trade Union and Party Branch of Beijing's 36th Middle School wrote: After reading the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily," we felt extremely indignant.

These materials have powerfully proven: the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has close ties with American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, and this clique is part of the Kuomintang bandits' counter-revolutionary organization. They are the most despicable, treacherous, and vicious enemies. We cannot allow the enemies of the people, like bacteria, to spread further. We request the government to resolutely suppress them and completely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries.

From the Hu Feng incident, we must learn a lesson. In the cause of socialist construction, class struggle has become more acute, and counter-revolutionaries will inevitably carry out sabotage activities. All teachers and staff unanimously agree that in the future, we must heighten political vigilance, arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism, and together with the people of the country, under the leadership of the Party, fight to the end against all enemies of the people for our happy and beautiful future.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Construction Workers' Union wrote: After the "People's Daily" published the first and second batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, all construction workers in Beijing were extremely angry about the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and unanimously demanded a thorough investigation of the criminal activities and political background of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and severe punishment. On June 10th, the "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, which further proved that Hu Feng and his gang are a group of counter-revolutionaries with close ties to imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. They showed deep hatred for the new society and the people's revolutionary regime, cursing the "demise" and "failure" of the people's revolutionary regime, fiercely opposing and sabotaging our socialist construction and socialist transformation cause, which is intolerable to the working class and all laboring people!

We represent the 70,000-plus members of the Beijing Municipal Construction Workers' Union and all construction workers, resolutely demanding that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members be punished according to the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries."

We must learn a lesson from this serious incident, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and more closely unite around the Communist Party of China, thoroughly and completely expel all hidden counter-revolutionaries like the Hu Feng clique.

Xu Boyuan and Chen Chengqing from the Research Office of the Ministry of Heavy Industry wrote: During the process of criticizing and exposing the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we have been very complacent, thinking that this is a matter of the literary circle and has little to do with us. After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, our anger reached its peak. It turns out that Hu Feng and the members of his counter-revolutionary clique are people of dubious origin, who have long been colluding with the American and Kuomintang reactionaries, hiding within the people, and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. Look, how cunning and vicious they are! They want to overthrow the revolutionary achievements we have already achieved, making six hundred million people suffer the darkness, poverty, and pain of the past. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is the common enemy of every patriotic citizen.

We are determined to join the ranks of this battle, heighten vigilance, expose the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden bad elements, and smash those "tigers" that eat people without spitting out bones.

Wuhangzhi and seven others from the Technical Group of the Fourth Construction Area of the Wuhan Steel Construction Company, Wuchang Branch wrote: We are technical personnel of a basic construction unit. Through the Hu Feng incident, we have further recognized the complexity of class struggle during the transitional period and the conspiratorial activities of reactionary remnants. Can we still be complacent and negligent? In the future, we must strengthen revolutionary vigilance, raise our level of Marxism-Leninism, and always be able to identify all hidden enemies infiltrating the revolutionary cause and give them a crushing blow.

Wang Feng and nineteen others from the Beijing Railway Institute's Attached Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School wrote: Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the exposure of the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a great victory in the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. Because a counter-revolutionary clique like the Hu Feng clique, hiding within the revolutionary ranks, if allowed to develop, would definitely cause incalculable damage to the socialist construction cause of our motherland.

We deeply feel that the exposure of the crimes of the Hu Feng clique is a very concrete education on class struggle for us. The Party has repeatedly taught us that during the transitional period, class struggle will become more complex and acute. Therefore, we must always maintain a high degree of political vigilance. From the already exposed materials, we can see that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionaries often choose those with ideological problems and low vigilance as targets, attempting to lure and win them over, making these people fall into their trap. Therefore, every one of us, especially Party members and Youth League members, must heighten vigilance, study Marxism-Leninism diligently, arm our minds, and avoid being deceived by counter-revolutionaries.

Sun Suqing from No. 264, Shuncheng Street, Beiguan District, Shenyang wrote: I am a housewife and a mother of three children. I saw in the newspaper the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and knew that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has long been loyal dogs of imperialism and the Kuomintang. I am filled with indignation that cannot be expressed in words. Hu Feng has long disguised himself as a progressive, hiding within the people, engaging in treacherous and vicious counter-revolutionary activities, attempting to destroy our revolutionary regime. Hu Feng is the enemy of the people. I demand that the government severely punish Hu Feng and the key counter-revolutionaries in his clique. As a housewife, I have also raised my awareness from this incident. I will raise my children to be good children who love the country and the people, and I will always be vigilant against hidden counter-revolutionaries.

Overcome complacency and learn the skills to fight against two-faced elements.

Pei Wenzhong and Jia Lanpo from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences wrote: After reading the three batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we felt an uncontrollable anger. We demand that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique be thoroughly smashed and severely punished!

As natural scientists of our motherland, we cannot ignore politics. The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has made us realize: while contributing our strength to the scientific cause of our motherland, we must also strengthen political theory study, heighten revolutionary vigilance, overcome complacency, and fight against all kinds of counter-revolutionaries attempting to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks!

Ding Xin, Wan Weizhou, and Wang Xin from the Staff Training Class of the Central Conservatory of Music wrote: We are a group of music workers currently studying at the Central Conservatory of Music. After seeing the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the "People's Daily," we were filled with extreme anger. We clearly saw the ugly and treacherous face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. This is a fierce struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, so we cannot think that it has nothing to do with the music circle. We hope that all patriotic music workers will stand up and fight against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. We should learn a profound lesson from the Hu Feng incident. Any political complacency and liberalism, any reduction in enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause, will give the enemy an opportunity to exploit. Therefore, we must be a hundred times more vigilant, more closely unite around the Party's banner, and fight for the completion of our great socialist cause.

Long Ting and Shi Jun from the Training Class for Agricultural Cooperatives in Liaoning Province wrote: The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is part of the American and Kuomintang special agents. They have counter-revolutionary political programs, organizational principles, and plans and tactics for struggle. They disguise themselves and infiltrate the revolutionary ranks to carry out sabotage work. They are more treacherous and vicious than armed enemies. They are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people. We can no longer be deceived by the Hu Feng clique. We must open our eyes, heighten vigilance, and expel the counter-revolutionaries.

Zhang Zhucun, a disabled soldier, wrote: I am a disabled soldier now working at the Central Institute for Nationalities. Previously, I did not know what Hu Feng was doing. After seeing the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the newspaper, I knew that Hu Feng and his henchmen were originally loyal dogs of Chiang Kai-shek.

We disabled soldiers have shed blood for the victory of the people's revolution. Some comrades have sacrificed their lives. The treacherous enemies want to destroy the victory fruits we have won with our blood and lives, which is what we hate the most! I hope to thoroughly clean up the Hu Feng clique and all counter-revolutionaries hiding in the revolutionary ranks and give them severe punishment.

The truth about Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary activities has been exposed, giving me a great lesson. Counter-revolutionaries are everywhere. We must always be vigilant and strengthen political study. As long as our vigilance is high, no matter how cunning the counter-revolutionaries are, we will definitely expose them.

Zhang Ying, a worker from the Shanghai Foguang Electric Machinery Manufacturing Factory, wrote: After the newspaper published the first and second batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, my understanding of their political background was still somewhat vague. After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I was shocked to realize that the backers of the Hu Feng clique are the enemies of the Chinese people—the Kuomintang bandits! I deeply feel that my political sense of smell is too dull! Thank you to the Party for sounding the alarm. Yes, the dying enemy will not easily accept their failure, and they will make their last struggle. To defend our victory fruits, we must always be vigilant and not let counter-revolutionaries find any loopholes. I demand that the government arrest the Kuomintang bandits' lackeys—Hu Feng, A Leng, and other counter-revolutionaries—and punish them according to the law.

The Administrative Cadres Training Class of the Ministry of Health, Industrial Hygiene Class wrote: We are students from the Administrative Cadres Training Class of the Ministry of Health, studying in major industrial departments across the country. After seeing the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the "People's Daily," we felt extreme hatred!

The Hu Feng clique is a counter-revolutionary clique against the Party, the people, and the revolution, loyal dogs raised by American imperialism and the traitorous Kuomintang. They conspire to carry out subversive activities, dreaming of the collapse of the people's government and the failure of the people's revolutionary cause, making us suffer again. We absolutely cannot tolerate it!

We must also learn a lesson from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident, heighten revolutionary vigilance. Counter-revolutionaries are everywhere. Therefore, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, arm our minds, and resolutely fight against all counter-revolutionary activities without mercy!

The Staff, Faculty, and Students of the Central Academy of Drama's Performance Training Class wrote: The "People's Daily" published three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, exposing the true face of the Hu Feng clique. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members, in collusion with the Kuomintang bandits, infiltrated our revolutionary agencies, schools, and organizations, carrying out conspiratorial activities, just like worms living in people's intestines, absorbing people's fat to nourish themselves, making people's minds confused and suffering from weakness, harming our socialist revolutionary cause. We are currently using Gorky's outstanding play "The Little Bourgeois" as our teaching material, and thus have a deeper understanding of the decadent and despicable bourgeois individualism that hates the growth of socialist forces.

Through the lesson of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident, we have realized that in the past, we did not fully recognize the conspiratorial activities of such worm-like enemies. Thank you to the Party newspaper for opening our eyes. We are determined to study Marxism-Leninism diligently in the future, enhance our ability to distinguish right from wrong and identify enemies, not allowing counter-revolutionaries to peddle their goods in front of us again. We are determined to carry out ideological reform, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary policies, eliminate the influence of reactionary literary thoughts, and firmly oppose liberalism, preventing the mistake of neglecting politics while focusing on business.

The entire class of the Preparatory Class of Renmin University of China wrote: After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, we had a discussion. The crimes of the Hu Feng clique aroused our extreme anger in our hearts.

The twenty-six of us, although still young, each have a segment of tragic life experience. In the old society, some of us entered factories at the age of ten, engaging in heavy labor and living inhuman lives; some of us worked for landlords since childhood, doing odd jobs; some of us spent our childhood under the brutal rule of Japanese imperialism. None of us had a few days of a full stomach. Fortunately, under the leadership of the Party, we were liberated and stood up, becoming masters of the country. The Party sent us to Renmin University of China to study. Our classmate Chen Shulan was even elected as a representative of the National People's Congress. These are things we never dared to dream of in the past, but now they have all been realized.

We are very clear about how these happinesses were obtained. Can we allow the counter-revolutionaries to restore power and oppress and exploit us again? No! Absolutely not! We demand the severe punishment of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique that destroys our happy life. We are also determined to learn a lesson from the Hu Feng incident, study hard, raise political awareness, and always be loyal to the Party. We not only want to learn the skills to build our country but also want to learn the skills of class struggle, so that we can contribute our youth and strength to building and defending our country.

Thoroughly eliminate hidden enemies and defend national construction.

The members of the Chinese Writers' Association, Xi'an Branch, including Du Pengcheng, Wei Gangyan, and the cultural workers of the People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps, including Xiao Pin, wrote: We are a group of cultural workers experiencing life on the railway construction site. During the time we lived with the People's Railway Corps, we personally felt the revolutionary heroism of the people's railway soldiers. No matter in the scorching summer, freezing winter, or storms, they are always full of high fighting spirit, rushing to build the railways of our motherland; many railways have left their indelible footprints and sweat. We deeply regret not fully reflecting the heroic and moving deeds of the heroes. But when we were about to encourage ourselves to deeply experience life and create works worthy of the heroic troops, we saw Hu Feng's anti-Party and counter-revolutionary "opinions." This treacherous counter-revolutionary did not hesitate to make people abandon the Party's stance in literature, discard the principles of socialist realism, and leave the people's interests and fiery struggles to "self-expand," thus achieving his evil goal of destroying the people's literary cause. This is how vicious it is!

Recently, we have seen the several batches of materials published by the "People's Daily," making us know that the Hu Feng clique is an organized, planned, and highly ambitious counter-revolutionary organization that is irreconcilable with the people's revolutionary cause. We absolutely cannot tolerate the slander and defamation of Hu Feng and his ilk against the Party and the people's revolutionary cause! We must resolutely smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, defend our country's construction cause, and defend our ideals! We demand the legal punishment of the evil counter-revolutionary Hu Feng and the unrepentant Hu Feng elements in his counter-revolutionary clique!

Zhuang Jianguo from a construction site in the frontline of Fujian wrote: After reading the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the "People's Daily," I could not suppress my anger! I demand that the government severely punish the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng!

On the frontline of Fujian, we have seen enemy planes hovering over our heads, seen enemy ships on the sea attacking our beautiful hometown, heard the enemy's "counterattack the mainland" from across the sea, and also suffered the sabotage of special agents infiltrating or hiding within us. We fully understand the treachery, ferocity, and viciousness of the enemy and also understand that only by eliminating the enemy can we defend the revolution and socialist construction.

The crimes of the Hu Feng clique are not different from the coordination of the Kuomintang traitorous clique's aerial and artillery bombardment? Is it not the coordination of the Kuomintang traitorous clique's "counterattack the mainland" call? Hu Feng and our enemies across the sea are exactly the same. We must resolutely and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique. We must heighten vigilance and be ready at any time to smash all armed and unarmed enemies.

Huang Xiu and four others from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army wrote: After reading the third batch of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the "People's Daily," all comrades here were extremely indignant. We demand that the people's government thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and severely punish the most heinous and unrepentant diehards!

We declare: in the future, we must be a hundred times more vigilant to defend the socialist construction of our motherland, resolutely smash all counter-revolutionaries and imperialist elements' conspiracies, and not only learn the skills to fight against armed enemies but also, together with the people of the entire country, learn the skills to fight against counter-revolutionaries hiding within the people, thoroughly clean them out of the people, so that our motherland can smoothly transition to a socialist society under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

The Trade Union Committee of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau wrote: After the three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique were published, the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was exposed to the world. We resolutely demand that the government severely punish the unrepentant Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members according to the law.

Through the Hu Feng incident, we have received another practical class education. We have a deeper understanding of the complexity and acuteness of class struggle during the transitional period. We are determined to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, more closely unite around the Communist Party of China, heighten vigilance, overcome complacency, actively participate in this serious struggle, further do a good job at our posts, and together with the people of the entire country, resolutely and thoroughly clean out all counter-revolutionaries to ensure the successful completion of the socialist construction cause of our motherland.

Fanzhaozhai from the China General Corporation wrote: The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is another great victory in the leadership of the Party in the process of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. After the criticism of Hu Feng's thoughts began, I thought that as a staff member of the state-owned commercial department, the Hu Feng incident was just a matter of the literary circle and had nothing to do with us state-owned commercial department staff. After reading the third batch of materials published in the "People's Daily," I realized that my political vigilance was not high. Now, our thoughts can no longer be complacent. We must actively participate in the battle, clean out this group of counter-revolutionaries, and thoroughly, completely, and thoroughly clean out all hidden counter-revolutionaries in our ranks!

Qian Ying from the procurement station in Hengjing, Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province wrote: I have read all three batches of materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the "People's Daily." I share the same hatred for this counter-revolutionary clique as the people of the entire country.

From the Hu Feng incident, I have a deeper understanding of the sharpening and complexity of class struggle at present. If we do not heighten political vigilance, the enemy will infiltrate our ranks to carry out sabotage. I am a young person from a rural area and also a core militia member (currently working temporarily at the procurement station), I will do a good job in local security work, monitor bad elements, and prevent their sabotage activities, so as to defend our production and socialist construction.

Chen Xi and Xu Licheng, sailors from Changsha, wrote: From the Hu Feng incident, we have realized that hidden counter-revolutionaries will use every means to infiltrate and conspire to sabotage our construction cause. Therefore, we must heighten vigilance, fully understand the complexity and acuteness of class struggle during the transitional period, and deeply understand the various forms of struggle, learning the skills to identify disguised and hidden enemies. We must closely unite around the Party, strengthen the Party's forces, and fight against all counter-revolutionary activities to defend our socialist construction.

Sutu Fensheng from the Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction wrote: I am an overseas Chinese who grew up abroad. In 1950, I returned to my motherland. After returning to my motherland, I personally saw the people of my motherland, under the leadership of the Party, overcome all difficulties at the fastest speed, restore the national economy that was left in ruins by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and begin the great cause of socialist construction. I saw my motherland becoming more prosperous and stronger every day, and my heart was truly excited and happy. I felt that after returning to my motherland, I was truly living a meaningful life, truly living a free and happy life. However, towards such a great and beloved new motherland, towards such a new society full of beautiful life, the Hu Feng elements are full of hatred, saying things like "I hate this social order" and "I almost hate everyone." It is clear that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is fervently hoping for the "demise" of our people's regime, fervently dreaming of the restoration of the reactionaries, rolling back the tide, and attempting to make the people of our country fall back into the abyss of endless suffering, making overseas Chinese lose their beloved motherland again. But we must shout at the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique: Hu Feng, this is your dream! Our people of the entire country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are building socialism victoriously. The ones that will "demise" are not us, but you, these counter-revolutionaries and your masters—the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits.

Sun Jianhua, a convalescent soldier from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, wrote: I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, a patient lying on a sickbed. After undergoing surgery, my wound has not healed, and my pain is imaginable, but I can endure it. However, after seeing the third batch of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, the cunning and viciousness of the Hu Feng clique made me feel more uncomfortable than the disease. I really could not suppress my anger.

This group of counter-revolutionaries is more despicable than armed enemies. They are "inspired" and "optimistic" about the counter-revolutionary civil war launched by the Kuomintang bandits, saying things like "because the national army frequently recaptured, the people's hearts are settled." Can history be distorted by them? We are witnesses to this segment of history. My hometown was once occupied by the Kuomintang bandits. The brutality of the enemy is still very clear in my memory. In a county of less than four hundred thousand people, they killed more than ten thousand civilians in just three months, sometimes burying hundreds of people in one pit. They used inhuman methods such as "machine-gun naming," "beheading to warn," and "burial alive" to deal with revolutionary people. While the Hu Feng elements say this is "the people's hearts are settled." Besides showing that they are the accomplices of the Kuomintang bandits, what else can it show? I demand the severe punishment of these counter-revolutionary criminals and am also determined to recover my health, learn skills, and be ready at any time to respond to the Party's call to annihilate all enemies!

The entire staff of the Developmental Biology Department of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute wrote: After reading the materials about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published by the "People's Daily," we were filled with boundless anger and hatred for the criminal activities of these counter-revolutionaries. We demand the resolute suppression of these human-faced beasts, the class enemies, and the thorough elimination of these counter-revolutionaries.

Under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the entire country are selflessly working to strive for the industrialization of our motherland. These counter-revolutionaries infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, secretly carry out conspiratorial sabotage activities, attempting to disarm us ideologically, make us deviate from the track of socialist construction, and restore the reactionary regime. Their intentions are so treacherous! We absolutely cannot tolerate it!

The exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has made us clearly realize: as citizens who love our motherland and are willing to contribute all our strength to the Party's cause, we must better raise our political awareness and vigilance. We must learn the skills to identify hidden enemies. No matter how cunning the enemy is, how well they hide, we will definitely be able to expose and punish them in time.

Li Shixian and Han Shiming, ethnic Tibetan cadres from the People's Government of the Directly Administered Township of Luoda, Zouqu County, Gansu Province, wrote: The truth about the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has been exposed. It turns out that they have close ties with the American and Kuomintang bandits. Whenever we mention the American and Kuomintang bandits' past bloody rule over our ethnic minorities, every Tibetan compatriot cannot help but feel indignant. We Tibetan compatriots, like other ethnic brothers, have enjoyed equal rights and a free, happy, and friendly life in the big family of our motherland after gaining liberation. We do not want the American and Kuomintang bandits to come back and oppress us again. But Hu Feng hopes for the return of the American and Kuomintang bandits, so he is our mortal enemy. We demand that the government severely punish him.

### 坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子

专栏：
坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
    从胡风事件中吸取教训
    何香凝
    从“人民日报”所公布的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料里，可以清楚地看出这一伙暗藏的反革命分子的阴险狠毒。看了这三批材料，我十分愤怒。我要求严厉镇压胡风反革命集团。
    胡风反革命集团，是我们全国人民的凶恶的敌人。杀人放火这样公开的敌人是易于识别的，而暗藏的反革命分子就比较难于发现，胡风反革命集团就是隐藏的反革命分子。可是，假的终究是假的，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动终于被揭露了。胡风分子打进了我们革命队伍里的许多部门，在共产党里，在解放军中，在民主党派内，在机关学校里，都发现了胡风分子。胡风事件，给我们严重的教训，全国人民今后一定要分外提高警惕，擦亮眼睛、清醒头脑，进一步揭发和肃清所有暗藏的反革命分子，保障我们的社会主义建设事业。
    我们的国家，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，几年来有了很大的成就，许多来我国参观过的外国朋友们，也都同声赞扬。极大多数的海外侨胞们，对祖国的进步面貌，是有正确认识的。但是在海外，许多帝国主义的走狗和蒋介石卖国集团分子，对我们伟大的祖国，不断地造谣诬蔑，想挑拨侨胞和祖国的关系。因此，千百万热爱祖国的侨胞们也应从胡风事件中吸取教训，要加强团结，提高警惕，不要使帝国主义的走狗们有可以利用的机会，粉碎一切对我们伟大祖国的造谣诬蔑和破坏。
    胡风的本质就是这样的
    黄炎培
    胡风我从没有认识过。胡风原名张光人，张光人我也没有认识过。
    胡风事件最初揭载于报纸的时候，我还和有些人同样地认为是思想问题。后来从报纸上细细地看到了一批又一批关于胡风反革命集团的材料，统共一百六十九封信，看完了才恍然大悟，这不是思想问题，中间有那么大的政治背景，不自觉地激起我高度的仇恨和愤怒。
    我现在明白了。读到了“湖北日报”记者所揭发的胡风对地主家庭的一贯的反革命立场那篇文章，我认识了胡风原来是：放高利贷，强奸无数妇女，残酷剥削农民、窑民、渔民，毒打农民，杀死农民，奸占贫农妻子，霸占公田、公湖，这样罪大恶极的血腥臭的大恶霸地主家庭的一个成员，胡风做出这种种勾当，并不奇怪，胡风的本质就是这样。
    反革命分子的罪恶活动，是多种多样的。它抓住了人类心理上的弱点，人类厌丑，装做丑鬼来吓弄人；人类爱美，装做美貌来诱惑人。后者的阴险狠毒，超过于前者。阴险狠毒的胡风正是这后者一流。胡风知道马克思列宁主义在人民中间获得的信仰，在一天加高一天，就把马克思列宁主义当做外衣披上身来了。料不到马克思列宁主义到了万恶的胡风手里，被利用来欺骗不懂和不懂而想懂马克思列宁主义的人。
    胡风的手法是“两面派”，搞的是“挖心战”，胡风的战略有时会从进攻转变为退却，“在忍受中求得重生”。胡风是善于“用孙行者钻进肚皮去”的策略钻进党的。但是，任凭胡风那么样阴险狠毒，到今天在强烈的太阳光照射之下，在人民群众千千万万只眼睛怒视之下，一切一切凶形怪相完全暴露了。
    胡风这一事件，发展到现在，只有将反革命的胡风依法处理，将胡风分子依法分别处理；对于隐藏着的胡风反革命集团残余分子，必须各方各面严密搜查，尽量发掘出来，勿让一个漏网。
    大家今后必须更加提高警惕，把胡风这一事件当做深刻的教育资料，要善于辨别伪善，肃清胡风之类的反动分子，并慎防一切反动分子的潜藏。当然，我们不能冤枉一个好人，但绝对不能放过一个坏人。
    我个人只想提出一点：胡风既经披着马克思列宁主义外衣，可能有些信仰马克思列宁主义和正在学习马克思列宁主义的青年，在没有养成高度的辨别好的和坏的、真的和伪的能力的时候，被炫惑了，拖进去了，发生或多或少的关系了。这种被欺骗而不愿永远跟着胡风走的人，今天必须趁早真诚地坦白地交代，只要老老实实地自动交代，相信我们爱护青年、珍惜人才的人民政府会予以合法的宽恕的。
    彻底消灭胡风反革命集团
    谭平山
    从“人民日报”所揭发的胡风反革命集团的三批材料看，可以完全证实胡风集团乃是一个有组织、有计划、有纲领而长期隐蔽在革命阵营之内进行反革命破坏活动的敌人。它们这种卑鄙无耻阴险毒辣的手段，已引起全国人民的无比愤怒。我完全同意彻底揭露和清算胡风集团危害人民危害国家的罪恶行为，并撤销胡风等首恶分子在国家机关和其他工作部门的一切职务，对于他们的反革命罪行依法严惩。
    胡风反革命集团的被揭露，是我们在阶级斗争中的一大胜利。这一事件证明了在我国社会主义工业化和建成社会主义的过程中，阶级斗争的更加尖锐和复杂。反革命是不会甘心的，他们会想尽一切办法来破坏我们的革命事业。但是我们有强大的革命力量，一定能够粉碎一切反革命的阴谋活动。我们应从这个事件吸取教训，绝不能麻痹大意。必须扎扎实实地以马克思列宁主义来武装自己的头脑，不断地提高政治思想水平和革命警惕性，划清敌我界限，坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子。　（原载“光明日报”）
    必须彻底清算胡风反革命集团的罪恶
    熊克武
    揭发胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动，是一场清除暗藏的反革命分子的尖锐斗争。我们必须从这一严重的事件中吸取教训，随时提高我们的政治警惕性。
    “人民日报”先后发布的三批材料，完全证实了胡风及胡风集团分子长期地伪装革命，对党所领导的文艺运动和整个革命事业，进行最阴险的破坏活动，是我们政治上的最凶恶的敌人。胡风及其分子采取隐蔽的方式渗入到我们革命阵营的各个战线上，甚至混入共产党内干着反党、反人民、反革命的勾当，这说明胡风集团决不是一个文化界少数野心分子的小集团，而是反革命分子、奸细、叛徒们的有领导、有计划的特务组织。胡风反革命集团的政治背景是很清楚的，胡风及其集团中的许多骨干分子很早就是帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮的忠实走狗，他们同帝国主义和蒋匪帮有着密切的联系，同它们里应外合地进行破坏人民政权的罪恶活动。
    这个惊人的反动集团，潜伏在人民阵营内部，干了许久危害国家、危害人民的勾当才被揭露出来，说明了我们在政治上的警惕性是非常不够的。胡风伪装进步骗取了全国人民代表大会代表的光荣席位，我和他同属四川省区，对于这个阴险毒辣的反革命分子的罪行，尤感愤怒。我坚决拥护全国各界人民的建议，立即撤销他全国人民代表大会代表的资格，依法予以严厉的制裁。我们并应为彻底肃清胡风反革命集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子而继续不断地斗争。
    揭发胡风反革命集团的罪行，把这批反革命分子从人民队伍中清除出去，是中国人民在共产党领导下进行反对内外敌人斗争中的一次重大胜利。不过，随着我们人民民主政权的日益强大和建设事业的突飞猛进，内外敌人必然会更加嫉视和仇恨我们，要继续对我们进行公开的或隐蔽的破坏活动，所以我们必须加强政治学习，提高革命警惕，严格分清敌我界限，从清算胡风反革命集团罪行这一事件中，吸取深刻的教训。　（原载“光明日报”）
    积极参加对胡风反革命集团的斗争
    赵朴初
    关于胡风的事件，我们佛教徒起初以为只是文艺界的问题，同宗教界无关，因此多不加注意。等到关于胡风反革命集团的材料在“人民日报”发表之后，才使我们吃了一惊，才提醒了我们：胡风的问题，从它的性质来说，决不仅仅是思想问题，从它的范围来说，决不仅仅是属于文艺界的问题，而是一个严重的政治事件。我们佛教徒和其他各阶层人民一样，决不能采取旁观态度，置身事外。
    从胡风的信件以及各方面所揭发的关于他的材料来看，胡风完全是一个一贯仇视党、仇视人民的坚决的反革命分子。而他所采取的手段比明显的敌人还要毒辣。多少年来，他披着马克思列宁主义外衣，混在革命队伍里，运用他自己所说的“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，来进行反革命活动。
    这种情况，正如佛经上这样一个故事：魔王对佛说“将来我的子孙，穿着你的衣服，破坏你的教”。胡风正是穿革命者的衣服，破坏革命事业的恶魔。
    六月十日“人民日报”发表的第三批材料，更完全证明胡风和他的一伙，同帝国主义国民党特务机关有着密切的联系，这不能不使我们万分愤怒。我们佛教徒坚决主张对胡风及其一伙反革命分子，依法加以惩办。
    胡风事件，大大地教育了我们宗教徒，它纠正了我们不关心政治的态度，教育我们要随时随地提高警惕，不仅要提防公开的敌人，还要防备隐藏的敌人，及时识破他们的伪装，及时予以清除，不许他们危害人民。
    佛教徒应当充分重视这一事件，并且认真展开学习，以提高自己的认识水平，明辨是非，分清敌我，和全国人民一道更加紧密团结在党和政府的周围，在保卫祖国建设，反对内外敌人的斗争中，更好地尽到自己的责任。
    严防反革命分子钻入宗教界
    达浦生
    读了“人民日报”陆续发表的揭露胡风反革命集团的材料之后，真是使人怵目惊心，愤恨不已。胡风集团原来是一伙打着进步的幌子，长期钻在革命队伍的各个部门中以至钻进共产党内，替他们的美蒋主子进行有计划、有步骤的阴谋活动的反革命分子。他们的目的在破坏人民民主专政，破坏民主统一战线，破坏人民文化事业，破坏祖国经济建设，破坏社会主义改造，配合蒋匪帮在台湾的垂死挣扎，妄想里应外合达到他们反革命复辟的狂妄企图。
    中国信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民，过去长期在民族和宗教方面所遭受到的国民党反动派的欺压、侮辱、屠杀和践踏，像是昨天的事一样记在我们心中。反动派恶狠狠的狰狞面目，我们永远是忘不了的。胡风反革命集团是我们各族人民的死敌。我代表中国伊斯兰宗教界坚决拥护彻查胡风反革命集团的罪行，依法予以严厉惩处。我们宗教界人士必须加强团结，提高警惕，严防胡风反革命分子和一切类似胡风的反革命分子钻入宗教界，并为彻底全部肃清胡风反革命分子而斗争。
    我恨透了这一伙反革命黑帮
    施小妹
    过去我还以为胡风这一帮人不过是些不三不四的文人，和我们工人没啥关系。可是当我听人家读了“人民日报”公布的材料，尤其是第三批材料后，才知道这一帮人原来是属于美蒋匪帮的一个特务集团。他们想推翻我们工人阶级领导的人民民主政权，想叫国民党反动派再来骑在我们头上压迫我们，我恨透了这帮狼心狗肺的反革命分子！
    我是一个六十六岁的老工人，今年才告老退休，过着幸福的晚年生活。可是我永远也不会忘记过去的苦难日子，一想起过去我就觉得心酸。在大革命时期，为了全国人民的解放，多少革命先烈抛头颅、洒热血，不惜牺牲自己的生命。那时候，蒋匪帮几次要捉我，我只得天天东躲西藏，秘密活动。我的大儿子施良才就是在一九二八年九月初三那天，和许多革命烈士一起被蒋贼杀害的；牺牲时，他还是个年轻的小伙子。
    今天的革命胜利就是无数烈士用鲜血换来的。现在，拿枪的敌人被我们打倒了；但是暗藏的敌人却用更恶毒的手段，千方百计地要破坏我们的社会主义事业，破坏我们的幸福生活，我们决不允许。我要求政府彻底把胡风反革命集团消灭干净，我们全体工人要积极响应党的号召，参加这一斗争，通过这一斗争，大大提高革命警惕性，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，保卫胜利果实，保卫我们的社会主义建设事业，为烈士们报仇！
                      （原载上海“劳动报”）
    胡风反革命集团是我们人民的死敌
    郭玉恩
    我是一个劳动农民，是全国人民代表大会的代表。当我看到“人民日报”连续揭发了胡风反革命集团的反党反人民反革命的罪恶事实时，我非常痛恨，我完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议开除胡风会籍及解除一切职务的决议。我以一个全国人民代表大会代表的身份，要求全国人民代表大会常务委员会按照宪法撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并要求最高人民检察院对胡风反革命集团的罪行进行必要的处理。从揭发胡风反革命集团的三批材料来看：胡风反革命集团是同美帝国主义蒋介石卖国集团有密切联系的，是人民的死敌。二十多年来他用了最阴险最狡猾的态度，对党采取了十分顽强的抗拒破坏，想尽一切办法来扩大他的反党反人民的活动，严重地危害了人民的利益，破坏了社会主义建设事业。他不满意我们劳动人民在党和毛主席的领导下建成幸福的社会主义社会，他憎恨着我们用斗争获得的胜利成果。他长期暗藏在革命队伍中进行反党、反人民、反革命的勾当。胡风反革命集团是我们全国人民的死敌，因此我们必须坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，巩固我们革命的胜利成果。今天胡风反革命集团被人民揭露出来，这是我们社会主义建设事业中的一大胜利，它再一次说明过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性。我们全体劳动人民必须一致动员起来，提高革命警惕，分清敌我，肃清一切暗藏的敌人。我们积极响应党和人民政府的号召、努力搞好农业生产合作社，增加生产，认真贯彻党的阶级路线，提高社员思想觉悟和革命警惕，严防反革命分子的破坏。

    清除一切暗藏的敌人
    龚自知
    “人民日报”发表的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，进一步证明胡风这一伙，很早就同帝国主义国民党特务机关有着密切联系，一贯反党反人民，是蒋匪帮的忠实走狗。他们长期伪装进步，秘密进行破坏活动，看到新中国今天越来越多的伟大胜利，为了里应外合，效忠他们逃到台湾、还在梦想复辟的主子，他们的阴谋破坏，也就更为积极，手法也就更为阴险毒辣。胡风一向隐藏着的反动面貌及其政治背景，现在已经揭穿了，这就更加激起我们的无比愤怒。我们和全国人民一致进行声讨，要求及时依法严惩胡风，彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团；并及时辨别清除一切暗藏的反革命分子，来保卫我们革命胜利果实、保卫我们社会主义建设。
    胡风反革命活动的特点，在于善于伪装隐藏，善于玩弄两面三刀破坏革命的险毒手法。他长期一贯以他伪装进步的一面，来掩护他破坏革命的一面。由于材料的不断揭露，事实充分证明，原来胡风多年来所散播的反动文艺理论，就是他所狂妄企图扩大影响，来起到破坏革命的反动作用的。他就是以文艺理论来做骗人幌子，掩护他的特务活动，来为美蒋万恶统治服务的。如他这样的暗藏敌人，比之公开杀人放火的匪特，更为阴险。但人民眼睛是雪亮的，通过批判揭发，剥掉他的伪装，结果也就完全现出他的丑恶原形。这说明由于今天阶级斗争的激化深入，将被消灭阶级的死硬顽固分子，必然有他垂死以前的最后顽强挣扎，也说明这样的顽抗反动分子，不论怎样明来暗来，对领导我们的党猖狂进攻，但是终于难逃人民的巨掌，必然为历史车轮所辗碎。胡风事件，对反革命分子是一个沉重打击，对我们社会主义革命事业是又一次的重大胜利。
    从胡风事件我们应该吸取的深刻教训，主要是我们的革命警惕性必须进一步提高，我们的政治嗅觉，必须进一步加强。我们不能对胡风这样的人，只看见他伪装进步的一面，而不看见他破坏革命的一面。不要表现为敌人破坏一下，我们就警觉一番，敌人藏躲下去，我们就重新麻痹起来。其实敌人并不可怕，真正可怕的还是我们自己的麻痹。胡风事件，如果不及时揭发，让他照旧猖狂下去，让他“突破缺口”、“窥测方向”，进行秘密颠覆活动，会给党和人民的革命事业造成重大损失。暗藏敌人的破坏活动，其危害性是这般地严重，提高警惕，加强嗅觉，从政治上组织上思想上进一步分清敌我，清除一切暗藏敌人，这在行动上是完全必要，在意义上是无比重大的。这是全国人民在政治战线上思想战线上一场激烈深刻的阶级斗争。我们必须在中国共产党领导下，加强团结，努力改造自己，为彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团、坚决打击一切暗藏的反革命分子而斗争，为进一步树立工人阶级辩证唯物主义世界观，深入批判资产阶级反动唯心主义世界观而斗争！
    胡风事件给我们的教训
    胡昭衡
    对胡风反革命集团的战斗正在开展着，我这时期虽然正远在大兴安岭腹心地带工作，但也抱着祖国解放前夕参加东北历次战役的心情，来参加战斗。
    这是党的号召！这是革命任务！这是国家和人民的根本利益所在！
    对胡风集团以及类似胡风集团的“人面兽心”的豺狼，我们必须坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把他们从革命队伍中清除出去，予以应得的惩处。但是问题跟着出来了，我们为什么“同老虎睡在一起”这么久？现在卧榻之旁，是否还有老虎窥伺呢？一切革命者，均须从这事件中吸取教训。
    教训很多，首要的是：过渡时期的阶级斗争是更尖锐更复杂的，我们必须经常保持革命警惕。革命警惕性只有积极参加对反革命的斗争才能受到锻炼，才能逐步提高。一切革命者必须行动起来，参加这次伟大的斗争。
    我们必须检查自己。胡风事件教育我们：政治麻痹、自由主义和思想斗争的不彻底性，是胡风集团这类敌人能长期在革命组织内潜伏活动的条件。对这些毛病，进行严肃的自我批评，加以克服，是完全必要的。
    要将斗争进行到底，不能满足于当前战果。以内蒙古自治区来说，几年来也曾同类似胡风集团的文艺思想进行过斗争，来维护党的文艺方针。所有我们的党政军民各种组织，都是社会主义革命的阵地和堡垒，必须使它纯洁、巩固，不能让敌人自内部夺取。一切革命者和真正同情革命的人，团结起来，扫除麻痹，提高警惕，对胡风集团及其他形形色色的暗藏敌人，乘胜追击，要像中央领导全国对胡风集团的斗争一样，在各地区也步步深入，给敌人以歼灭性打击，把他们全部肃清。
    最后，我们必须记取的教训，就是不要忽视理论战线的斗争，不要把理论斗争和政治斗争隔离起来。马克思列宁主义是我们的战无不胜的武器，胡风集团就是首先在这条战线上被我们突破、击溃，因而全线瓦解的。轻视理论学习的同志，不应该再从这次斗争中学习一点马克思主义基本知识么！
    不获全胜，决不收兵
    胡可
    胡风集团的反革命活动正陆续被揭露出来，我们开始看到了这些家伙们的原形。那曾经装扮得像有些“小资产阶级的革命性和立场”的、甚至骗取党员称号的“作家”，“诗人”，“理论家”，“革命干部”，原来是一伙卑劣阴险狠毒的美蒋特务！
    当胡风预感到形势不妙的时候，曾把他的假检讨要点通知他的爪牙张中晓等，叫他们看看里面
  “不能涉及的是什么”，这些家伙们认为最最“不能涉及的”，看来就是“人民日报”所发表的这几批材料里“涉及”的这些，特别是第三批材料所“涉及”到的他们的原形吧？是啊，如果匪徒们自己把身份、履历、主子是谁都说出来，岂不是不可能
  “在忍受中求得重生”了么？党和人民并非胡风所盼望的那样，也“为乐观估计所蔽”，放松对于反革命分子的追究。不！匪徒们认为最“不能涉及的”，恰恰是我们认为必须“涉及”的！我们还要继续“涉及”下去！要“涉及”这伙匪帮的全部阴谋！全部根柢！全部花名册！
    阅读第三批材料“涉及”到的这些肮脏行径，那是真要“忍受生理上的厌恶”才行。这批匪徒们的密信，使我们嗅到那从“中美合作所”、“山洞陆军大学”、“中字方面”、“蛇窟”等处发散出来的血腥味，脓味！使我们听到那“打囚徒的鞭子”声，听到那特务们在“自信”的时候和“乐观”的时候从牙缝里发出的狞笑声，听到那在大陆上失败以后所发出的狺狺咒骂，听到那商议打“基础”“巩固阵地”“窥测方向”“找缺口”等阴谋活动的嘁嘁喳喳声。这些卑鄙阴险的信件，是胡风等特务匪徒们最“真诚”的“作品”！这些“真诚”地表现了他们的丑恶凶残面目的“私房话”，很可能就是他们作为梦想蒋介石王朝复辟时拿来邀赏的材料，它们把匪徒们的“心迹”表现得多么“坦荡”啊！
    这些密信，用着一切恶毒字眼来咒骂我们的国家，咒骂我们的党，咒骂我们领袖的著作，憎恨我们流够了血建立起来的社会秩序。一切我们所热爱的、愿献出生命来保卫的，都是他们恨之入骨的。作为一个公民，作为一个革命军人，作为一个党的文艺工作者，我难以抑制受辱的心情，我难以抑制我的愤怒！
    只要嗅嗅这些密信散发出来的气味，每个人都能立即分辨出来这是什么人。这是敌人！这是一伙同我们不共戴天的要拚个你死我活的匪帮！我们对这些家伙原来并不陌生，什么“收复”“陷落”呀，“国军”“匪军”呀，什么“万恶的共匪”呀这些字眼，同蒋匪美帝的那些卑劣龌龊的宣传品，不是一个调门吗？这些货色的制造者们的原形，不是我们曾经打过交道的吗？那在战场上装死又跳起来开枪的蒋匪“政工人员”，那撕去肩章冒充士兵又企图从俘虏群里逃跑的反动军官，那“一不做，二不休”负隅顽抗拒不交枪的死心特务，那逃亡在外又领着蒋匪军回来屠杀农民的恶霸地主，不正是他们一伙吗？
    在战场上，在土地改革运动中，我们对这样的敌人曾经是有着高度的警惕的。当我们取得了胜利，开始进行建设的时候，这伙匪徒们却利用了我们一些同志的骄傲自满和麻痹大意的缺点，利用了我们一些同志的顾了业务忘记政治的缺点，猖狂地活动起来！这伙匪徒们穿上干部服，打起文艺的幌子，使用几个马克思主义的名词，骗取着人们的信任，暗地里干着替蒋贼和美帝国主义“联络人”“争取人”、刺探情报、窃取文件、按设据点、配合战争阴谋的罪恶勾当。长期以来他们进行这种罪恶的活动，这对我们不能不是一个极大的教训！
    我们要百倍地警惕起来，再不能麻痹大意了！为了保卫我们已经取得的胜利，为了我们的社会主义的事业，为了我们母亲和孩子的安宁，我们要勇敢地参加这场战斗！根除潜藏在人民队伍中的一切反革命分子！不获全胜，决不收兵！
    严惩敌人
    孙维世
      “人民日报”公布了胡风反革命集团的三批密信，证明了胡风集团是同美蒋特务机关有密切联系。我过去只把他们看成文艺界的一群坏胚，真是太麻痹大意了。我们太善良了，对待敌人要狠——对待敌人的善良就是对待革命的残忍！我们要坚决镇压这群美蒋的特务恶棍，不让一个反革命分子漏过人民的法网！
    党和毛主席在千辛万苦中领导着我们走向了胜利，烈士们的尸骨未寒，我们今天自由幸福的生活得来是多么不易！我们要提高警惕，保卫我们胜利的果实。美蒋特务想钻进我们的内脏，瓦解我们，毒害我们，进行蒋介石反动政权复辟的阴谋。他们耍着两面派的手腕，变着五花八门的魔术，在我们面前装出虚伪的笑容，在我们的脑后打闷棍。他们仇恨革命、仇恨人民、仇恨党、仇恨我们的领袖。当革命处于艰巨的环境，我们从延安撤退，背着包袱行军时，正是胡风反革命集团拍手称快的时候；当全国解放，人民在庆祝胜利的时候，胡风反革命集团在暗中恨得咬牙切齿。如今胡风反革命集团在人民的照妖镜前现出了他们凶狠卑鄙的原形，他们逃不了人民法律的判裁！
    在我们革命队伍中，还有反革命分子在暗暗潜伏着，他们除了老老实实向人民投降，向组织坦白交代问题外，别无出路。人民的眼睛雪亮，是会把他们一个个的连根拔出来！对不向人民缴械投降的反革命分子，人民是决不会饶恕的！
    学会识别反革命分子的本领
    冯乃超
    胡风反革命黑幕终于被揭发出来了。他们是一群同美帝国主义蒋匪帮有着密切联系的反革命分子。他们憎恶劳动人民，仇恨人民革命事业。他们不愿意看见一个富强幸福的新中国，反对中国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业。三批材料有力地说明了一件事，即反革命分子伪装革命，钻进革命队伍里面来，进行反革命的勾当。这些事实给我们当头棒喝：“不能再麻痹下去了！”
    胡风钻进中国革命文艺界的目的，今天对证事实，是很清楚的。他要破坏革命文艺界同党的关系。他企图挑拨当时革命文艺界的领导者鲁迅先生同中国共产党的关系，以削弱党所领导的有较大影响的文艺阵线。鲁迅先生逝世前对文艺界的吱吱喳喳现象，曾表示痛心，其实是胡风的兴风作浪。
    抗日战争初期，“七月”杂志在武汉出版。我们建议胡风放弃同人杂志的方针，扩大约稿范围，团结更多的作家，遭到他坚决的拒绝。当时还看不出他别有企图的阴谋。不久，他的宗派活动便引起作家们的注意。他对刚成立的全国作家抗敌协会的通俗文艺工作表示极度的蔑视，并引起不必要的论争。作家间受了胡风两面派手法的欺骗，对“七月”的出版，是表示欢迎的，而胡风却无时无刻不说“七月”遭到冷淡或打击。我当时对胡风这种作法，很不了解，现在对证事实，才知道他是在制造分裂。
    有人怀疑：革命的文艺工作者同胡风纠缠了二十年，为什么一点也不发觉他的破绽。这当然要怪我们太缺乏社会知识和阶级斗争经验。从胡风身上散发出来的反革命气味，我们也有时候闻到了，但由于麻痹大意，仍然给他欺骗过去了。胡风曾向我暗示，阿垅和党的某一方面有联系，而这个联系就是通过胡风本人。这样，胡风把阿垅打扮成“革命者”，也把自己打扮成“革命者”。胡风是这样那样地而且经常地玩弄欺骗手段的。胡风集团是一个反革命黑帮，这个判决是百分之百的正确。他们富有阶级斗争经验，而我们却“书生气十足”。
    必须从这次惊心动魄的斗争中学会识别这些匪徒！
    科学技术工作者要积极参加粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争
    钱钟韩
    “人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，更进一步暴露了胡风集团的反革命阴谋活动和政治背景。原来，胡风集团的许多骨干分子乃是伪装着的美蒋特务，他们配合美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团，进行着有组织、有计划的暗害行为。我们科学技术工作者一致要求彻底揭露和打垮这样的反革命组织，并严厉镇压罪大恶极的反革命分子胡风。
    我自己，和许多科学技术界的同志一样，过去一向对胡风反动集团的声讨不够关心，认为这是文艺界内部的事，同我无涉；在看到了胡风的反党文艺纲领之后，还感觉不出其中的反革命政治意图。这充分暴露出了我们在政治上的麻痹和嗅觉不灵！
    我们科学技术工作者应起来积极参加对胡风反革命集团的斗争。第一，现在事情已很清楚，这不是什么文艺思想的问题，而是同美帝国主义、国民党特务机关有着密切联系的反革命集团斗争的一个严重问题。而且，由于我们警惕性不高，事情已发展到这样严重的程度，这些反革命分子已经钻进了我们的党和国家机关，钻进了某些学校和群众团体，猖狂地破坏我们的革命事业。虽然由于党的坚强和人民的觉悟，这些暗藏的反革命分子终于被我们揭发出来了，但我们不能再麻痹大意，我们除了坚决地查明和清除这些毒蛇猛兽外，更不要忘了帝国主义的包围和过渡时期中尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的现实，对一切伪装的反革命活动应保持经常的高度警惕。
    第二，事实已证明：胡风反革命集团分子竭力拉拢和设法利用的对象，大多是那些不积极要求改造自己的小资产阶级知识分子。胡风歌颂小资产阶级的“自发性”，同美帝国主义的“白皮书”中希望“个人自由主义分子”能在解放后的新中国起“独立”作用，正是一脉相传的反革命手法。因此，在一切知识分子中——包括科学技术工作者在内，同胡风反革命集团进行战斗，是有着重大意义的。我们必须彻底清查反革命分子胡风和其他暗藏的反革命分子。
    最后，同目前帝国主义国家中的反动学者不同，胡风是以革命、进步的外衣来掩藏其极端反动的唯心理论和反革命阴谋的，胡风是以歪曲马克思主义来反对马克思主义、反对革命的。这种做法对小资产阶级知识分子中的落后部分能起很大的迷惑作用。因此我们一方面要在组织上粉碎胡风的反动集团；另一方面，在这一斗争中，还要认真学习马克思主义，努力批判本门科学中的资产阶级唯心主义思想，才能在各种具体问题上辨别真的和假的马克思主义，才能在理论战线上和学术战线上堵住一切漏洞，以免在这些问题上上反革命分子的当。这对我们自己的改造，和对国家的社会主义建设事业是有着重大的意义的。
                    （原载南京“新华日报”）
    不要给暗藏的反革命分子有机可乘
    朱颜
    “人民日报”连续公布了关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，完全证实了胡风集团是最阴险、最恶毒的反革命分子。他们耍弄极其卑鄙狡猾的两面派手法，混入了我们政府机关、教育机关、部队、报馆、工厂、工会及党组织，有计划、有组织地暗害着人民革命事业，激起了我心中不可抑制的愤怒！
    在三批材料没有发表以前，政治嗅觉迟钝的我，还天真地认为胡风问题不过是文艺思想问题，岂知在祖国社会主义建设日趋胜利的今天，人人都在欢欣鼓舞，而胡风集团竟这样咬牙切齿地仇恨党、仇恨革命政权、乃至仇恨一切人呢？现在我恍然大悟了，原来胡风集团中许多骨干分子，在很早以前就同美蒋特务机关有密切联系。他们是蒋介石卖国集团的忠实走狗，暗藏在人民革命阵营内部，不断乘机蠢动，来破坏人民的革命建设事业，胡风反革命集团是我们最危险的敌人！
    我们每一个人，包括我们医药科学研究工作者在内，应当从胡风事件中吸取教训，要不断加强理论学习和思想锻炼，提高政治警惕，使暗藏的反革命分子再无机可乘。
    坚决镇压，依法严惩胡风集团
    舒模
    “人民日报”发表了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，将胡风反革命集团的最后一层鬼皮揭开了。要问胡风和胡风集团的主子究竟是谁？很清楚：就是在台湾为他喝彩、捧场的美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮。正因为是这样，所以胡风和胡风集团才对今天的新社会有着刻骨的“憎恨”，对人民革命的政权加以恶毒的诅咒；也正因为这样，所以他们才“恨一切”在共产党领导下为建设社会主义社会而奋斗的“人”。原来他们所企求的“更远大的未来”，就是蒋介石匪帮反动统治的复辟和人民革命政权的“灭亡”。他们想要一天天走向幸福未来的中国人民，再回到黑暗时代里去，再去做帝国主义的奴隶，再去过被剥削和被压榨的苦难生活。
    正如“人民日报”编者按语所说：“他们不懂得客观世界的规律，他们用以想事的方法是主观主义的和形而上学的方法，因此他们的估计总是错误的。”他们以为用他们的“主观战斗精神”就可以使得历史前进的车轮倒转回去。错了！被“击碎”的，不是六万万人民筑成的坚强“铁壁”，而是他们那个“脏臭”的反革命集团。
    现在是真像大白了。对于这些反革命分子，要坚决镇压，依法惩处。同时我们更应该提高警惕，尤其我们文化界，面对着这样复杂的尖锐的阶级斗争，不能再有自由主义和麻痹思想了，而要百倍地提高政治警惕性，和全国人民一道，把隐藏着的胡风集团分子及类似胡风集团的一切反革命分子，坚决地从我们人民队伍中清除出去。
    依法惩处胡风反革命集团
    中国科学院数学研究所关肇直、齐景泰等四十
  人来信：看了关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，我们感到无比的愤怒。这些材料完全证明了胡风集团是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的。我们要求政府依法严厉制裁胡风集团中的怙恶不悛的反革
  命的匪徒们。
      我们一定要从胡风事件中吸取教训，要努力学
  习辩证唯物主义，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，提高政治嗅觉，加强革命警惕性。我们也要把类似胡风集团的一切暗藏在我们革命队伍里的反革命分子坚决地彻底地清除出去，以保证伟大的社会主义建
  设事业的胜利！
    北京故宫博物院人事科邓文林来信：胡风反革命集团，是人民的最恶毒、最凶狠的敌人，它比那些拿着枪、带着刀的反革命分子更加险恶和毒辣。
  他们企图用“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”来推翻人民民主政权，实现他们的主子帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮企图在我国大陆进行“复辟”的阴谋。
    现在，这些阴险毒辣的敌人的真面目已被揭露了。这是我们党和人民的胜利。我们要求乘胜追击，将胡风反革命集团彻底查清，对一贯同人民为敌的怙恶不悛的胡风分子，给以坚决的严厉的镇压！
    这次事件教育了我。我们一定要百倍地加强警惕，加强政治学习，提高政治嗅觉，把暗藏在我们革命队伍中的一切反革命分子坚决地、彻底地消灭干净！
    辽宁省锦西化工厂方以矩、吕彦杰等九人来信：从“人民日报”揭露的第三批材料来看，胡风老早就同国民党特务组织——“中统局”“中美合作所”等有着密切的联系，策划着和进行着反革命的罪恶活动。因此胡风决不是一个一般的反革命分子，而是最阴险、最毒辣的反革命大头子。
    我们虽然是些搞技术工作的人，但对于这样一场政治斗争，也决不能袖手旁观。参加这个复杂的尖锐的阶级斗争，是人人有责的。我们要求严惩死不悔悟的胡风分子，保障我国社会主义建设事业的顺利进行！
    北京市建华铁工厂周瑞昌、马慧芳等七人来信：当我们读完了“人民日报”揭发的胡风集团反党反人民反革命的材料时，激起了无比愤怒。
    胡风及其党羽们，是披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，潜伏在革命阵营内的反革命分子。
    我们要坚决保卫人民的胜利果实，绝对不能让这些反动分子留在我们队伍里边。
    我们要求依法严厉惩办胡风。
    中央体育学院全体师生员工来信：从“人民日报”所揭露的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料中，我们可以清楚地看出，胡风反革命集团的主子就是帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮。胡风反革命集团对革命事业，对我们所获得的胜利是极端恐惧和仇恨的。他们打入共产党内、打入机关、群众团体、厂矿、学校的内部，窃取文件，探听情报，争取人，建立阴谋活动的“据点”，从内部进行破坏。但是，无论他们怎样狡诈，终于被人民揭露了。
    胡风反革命集团反党反人民的罪恶活动，激起了我们无比的愤怒，我们举行了全体师生员工大会，一致通过决议，要求政府严厉镇压胡风反革命集团。
    通过这一事实，我们更清楚地认识到，在过渡时期阶级斗争更加尖锐更加复杂了。我们一定响应党和政府号召，积极投入这一战斗，坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团，并进一步加强政治学习，提高警惕，坚决地把一切隐藏的反革命分子清除出去，巩固我们人民民主专政，以便胜利地完成社会主义建设。
    中国作家协会创作委员会秘书室全体工作人员来信：胡风反革命集团的第三批材料的公布，更进一步揭穿了这批反革命分子的政治背景和他们反革命的阴谋活动。原来这些坚决同党和人民为敌的胡风分子都是些别有来历的家伙。我们做为作家协会的工作人员，对于敌人在自己身边的活动，不但毫无所知，反而或多或少地受过敌人的欺骗和利用，这是一个刻骨铭心的惨痛的教训！
    我们要把愤怒化为行动的力量。一方面从斗争中吸取教训，提高自己的政治觉悟和政治敏感；一方面更要坚决地站在斗争的前列，无情地揭露一切敌人，一定要将这一帮万恶的反革命分子从各个阴暗的角落里抓出来，使他们再也无处容身，以保持我们革命队伍的纯洁。因此我们提出几点要求：
    一、彻底追查每个胡风分子的历史和罪恶活动，坚决彻底地粉碎他们的反革命组织，不让一个暗藏的反革命分子漏网。
    二、建议中国作家协会开除胡风反革命集团的骨干分子绿原、阿垅、路翎、芦甸、方然等的会籍，并建议法院将所有死心塌地的反革命分子逮捕法办。
    三、要求全国人民代表大会常务委员会建议原选举单位立即撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会的代表资格，并要求有关机关给以严厉的镇压。
    华东政法学院研究处潘念之、石国强等七人来信：我们又一次以无比愤怒的心情看完了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料。问题是更清楚了，胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子如阿垅、绿原等人，原来就是国民党反动派的“剿共”政治工作者、国民党的军官和“中美合作所”的特务。他们对蒋介石发动的内战充满了“乐观”，而对解放后的新社会、对人民革命政权却表现了刻骨的仇恨，“几乎恨一切人”。这就没有什么奇怪的了。
    今天，真相已经大白，我们要求原选举单位立即依法撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，立即由司法机关按照“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”严厉惩办胡风、阿垅和绿原等反革命首要分子，同时我们也警告一切胡风集团分子，必须赶快悔过认罪，争取人民的宽大处理。在人民政权之下，任何隐藏的或公开的反革命分子除及早悔罪自新之外，决无其他生路。胡风反革命集团的破获，就是一个有力的例证。
    中国国民党革命委员会财政部支部全体同志来信：“人民日报”先后发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，已经确切证明胡风集团是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有着密切联系的反革命组织，是一伙进行反革命勾当的黑帮匪徒，是我们中国人民的最阴险、最狡猾的阶级敌人。他们的罪行不能不激起我们无比的愤怒。
    胡风反革命集团分子，披着马克思主义的外衣，以文艺工作为幌子，混入我们机关、部队、企业、团体，有些甚至骗得“共产党员”的称号。胡风集团的许多骨干分子同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，很久以来就结成一体，向党、向人民、向我们的革命事业，疯狂地进行进攻。他们这种滔天的反革命罪恶，必须受到国家法纪的严厉制裁。我们要求立即撤销胡风全国人民代表大会的代表资格，并逮捕法办；同时要求彻底清除暗藏在我们革命队伍中的胡风分子和一切反革命分子，决不让一个漏网。
    我们从胡风事件中，进一步认识到在过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性。内外敌人是要千方百计来破坏我们革命事业的。我们必须提高警惕，从各方面揭露和检举胡风反革命集团的罪恶，并严防一切反革命分子混入我们的内部。我们一定要贡献一切力量，和全国人民一道，在中国共产党的英明领导下，为保卫我们的革命政权，保卫我们的自由幸福的生活斗争到底。
    人民文学出版社第五编辑室赵其文、王利器、黄肃秋等九人来信：我们读了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料以后，激起了无比的愤怒和仇恨。胡风反革命集团中的基本骨干，有的是帝国主义国民党分子，有的是反动军官，有的是托洛茨基分子，有的是革命叛徒和自首变节分子，二十年来，不知欠下了人民多少血债。解放以后，他们潜伏在人民内部，大肆活动，企图颠覆我们的革命政权和事业，这是我们所不能容许的。我们要求人民政府彻底清查这一群反革命分子的一切罪行，依法给予惩处，不让有一个漏网。
    渤海工程处长山工区张鸿德来信：我是一个筑港工人。我看到了报纸上所公布的关于胡风反革命集团的材料后，怎么也压抑不住自己的愤怒。当全国人民展开热火朝天的社会主义建设的时候，胡风反革命集团却暗地里进行着反人民的阴谋勾当。胡风集团是中国人民的公敌。对这样的反革命分子只有镇压、严办。
    沈阳市大东区矿山机器厂技工学校谭洪祥来信：我在六月十日看到了“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”，愤慨万分。现在更清楚地看到：胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动，和蒋介石匪徒没有什么两样。他想推翻人民民主政权，可是人民的力量是强大的，不管他再怎样阴险，也是逃不出人民的法网的。现在我要求政府给予胡风反革命集团的首要分子以坚决的镇压，以保障我国的社会主义建设事业顺利进行。
    提高警惕，粉碎一切反革命阴谋活动
    太原第一发电厂电气技术员王迪凡来信：看到关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，我感到无比的愤恨。胡风集团中的一些骨干是一些彻头彻尾的特务分子。他们憎恨新社会新制度，梦想着蒋介石反动派复辟，这充分暴露了他们的反动本质和真面目。
    从欧阳庄给胡风的信里，使我这样知识分子出身的人不得不引起百倍的警惕。因为一个意志不坚定的人，一个犯了自由主义的人，最容易堕入胡风等反革命分子的圈套。为此，我除了坚决要求严厉惩治胡风集团外，并决心加紧学习马克思列宁主义，提高政治警惕性，揭露一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    红星集体农庄庄员李龙海来信：我连续看到了揭露胡风反革命集团的三批材料，那些反党、反人民、反革命的密信，激起了我的无限愤恨。看了这些材料，使我充分认识到胡风、阿垅等是国民党蒋介石卖国贼的忠实走狗，他们长期地披着伪装混在革命队伍里，向党和人民进攻。这真令人痛恨。我们要时时刻刻提高警惕，坚决镇压一切反革命分子。
    中国青年社杨誉戎来信：“人民日报”揭发的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，是胡风集团反革命活动的铁的证据。这批材料，使他们露出了原形——美蒋特务机关的特务，蒋介石的忠实走狗。难怪他们对革命有那样大的“仇恨”，“憎恨”人民民主专政，把伟大的镇压反革命运动污蔑为“封建潜力在疯狂的杀人”，原来他们就是被镇压的对象。他们是人民的大敌。我要求坚决镇压这批反革命分子！
    胡风反革命集团的被揭露，使我进一步认识到过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐化和复杂化。反革命分子千方百计的利用革命队伍中的不坚定分子，钻到我们的“肝脏”里破坏。因此我感到应该更好地提高自己的觉悟，不给反革命分子任何可乘之机，坚决粉碎一切反革命分子的活动！
    北京市东四区民主妇女联合会李驰来信：关于胡风反革命集团的材料一批，二批，三批连续地发表了，人们再也按不住这颗愤怒的心。今天，东四区桃条胡同几个家庭妇女、街道妇女代表会议的主任，她们怀着无比的愤怒和仇恨声讨胡风反革命集团，要求政府严厉惩办这些坚决同人民为敌的反革命分子，并继续追剿，彻底粉碎这个反动集团。妇女主任郑英（煤矿局职工家属）说：“我是个家庭妇女，又没文化，开始听到无线电广播，觉得这是文艺界的思想问题，和咱没关系。现在事实说明了，敌人是无孔不入的，他们盗窃党内的秘密文件，辱骂共产党，他们要从思想上解除人民的武装。这些反革命分子想要破坏人民的幸福生活。因此，这个斗争和我们妇女也是有关系的。”副主任李千锦说：“以前我认为拿枪的敌人能破坏我们，可是胡风，他比拿枪的敌人还凶恶，他是诡计多端的阴谋家。咱们要发动妇女姐妹们一起保卫我们的好日子，彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团。”五十三岁的吴瑞莲老太太说：“这件事教育了我，今后要更加提高警惕，揭发坏人坏事，努力作好街道工作。”
    党的英明伟大，及时地揭发了胡风集团的反革命活动，是党在建设时期的又一次的伟大胜利。大家都表示要百倍地提高警惕，并带动街道妇女努力学习，提高觉悟，让任何敌人也逃不脱人民的审判。
    中央气象台廖伯偕来信：我是气象岗位上的一个通讯兵。以前我很不了解胡风这个阴险的变色的蜥蜴。但经过这次学习，激起了我无比的愤怒。从“人民日报”揭发的三批材料中，可以看出胡风和他的爪牙是怎样地敌视党和人民；怎样地用阴险毒辣的手段来破坏革命事业。这是现实生活中阶级斗争日益尖锐化的又一次反映。
    胡风集团的反党活动已经给革命事业造成了损失，并且影响了不少的青年。我们气象部门中也有受了这个集团分子影响的青年。为什么胡风劝路翎的妻子（余明英）继续留在我们台上工作呢？也就是为了把“据点”扩充到气象领域中来。由于这些关系，我们局内的个别同志不正受了很坏的影响吗？就有这样的同志在过去狂热地崇拜阿垅（亦门）的作品，并且和路翎等密切地取得联系，还在不久以前用同情的口吻写信去安慰这些胡风的忠实党羽们。事实太明显了，我们不能天真地认为胡风集团只会在“文坛”上兴风作浪，它也要到各个部门来散布影响的。我们要警惕啊！绝不要让敌人来钻空子。
    上海越剧院来信：我们感谢党一层一层地剥掉了胡风反革命集团的外衣，使我们看出他们的原形。他们，原来是以反动军官、托洛茨基分子、革命叛徒、自首变节分子为骨干而组成的。
    过去，我们实在太老实也太麻木了。敌人已钻在我们“肝脏”里，步步深入，层层组织，狠命的向我们展开“挖心战”了，我们却长期地不知痛从何来？敌人的真面目被揭露了，我们才为我们的麻痹思想而吃惊。同志们！我们要治好这种政治上的流行性感冒，随时警惕敌人。我们一定要从胡风事件中吸取教训，刻苦地学习马克思列宁主义，坚决贯彻毛主席的文艺方针，铲除脱离政治、脱离斗争、脱离生活的恶劣倾向。“经一事长一智”，我们再不能在政治上麻木不仁了。
    吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区人民政府蔡正默来信：“人民日报”连续揭露的关于胡风反革命集团的材料，证明胡风是我们各族人民的敌人。他们用尽各种卑鄙手段，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，混在革命队伍里，有组织、有计划地进行反革命活动。他们的目的是企图要各族人民再回到那反动派统治的黑暗日子里，这是我们决不能允许的。我是在祖国的怀抱里长大的朝鲜族青年，同各兄弟民族青年一起，我要参加对胡风反革命集团的斗争。我们不容许这样反革命分子再混在革命队伍里，破坏我们的社会主义建设。我们各兄弟民族都要提高警惕，为了可爱的祖国和将来的幸福，我们要团结一致，奋斗到底。
    抚顺市文学艺术工作者联合会来信：我们看了“人民日报”发表的“关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料”以后，感到了极大的愤慨！
    事实已经十分明显：胡风反革命集团的许多骨干分子很早以来就是蒋介石国民党匪帮的忠实走狗，他们同帝国主义国民党特务机关有着密切联系，长期地伪装革命，潜藏在革命队伍内部，干着反革命勾当。然而，任何隐蔽的反革命分子和反革命集团一定要被人民的巨掌所粉碎，正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。
    胡风反革命集团的事件给了我们很大的教训。我们要更加紧密地团结在党的周围，努力学习马克思列宁主义，百倍地提高革命警惕性，坚决地同一切暗藏的敌人展开斗争。
    北京铁路管理局丰台运输分局丰台变电厂全体工人来信：看到了报纸所揭露的胡风集团的反党、反人民的材料，知道了他们是我们的阶级敌人，我们不能站在斗争的外面。我们是中华人民共和国的公民和工人阶级的成员，我们要坚决参加到这一斗争中来，努力学习政治，提高革命警惕，同一切反革命分子进行斗争。
    锦州回民联合会任绍勤来信：胡风反革命集团的罪行，已大白于世了。我们要求依法严办胡风及其集团中的骨干分子。
    胡风集团是全国各个民族的死敌。我们回族过去在蒋介石匪帮的统治下，过着牛马不如的生活，政治地位更谈不到。由于我们各族人民的救星毛主席领导全国人民进行斗争，我们才得到了解放，我们在政治、经济、文化各方面都翻了身。美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮的特务——胡风集团却要破坏我们的幸福生活，我们决不答应。我们一定要提高警惕，清除一切暗藏的反革命分子，来保卫我们的好生活和伟大的社会主义建设事业。
    中国药材公司安徽省蚌埠市公司收发员李长年来信：我看了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料以后，感到极大的愤怒。我要求政府严厉惩办万恶的特务头子胡风，彻底追查胡风反革命集团的一切罪行，并要求把混入党内的胡风分子清除出去。我们要提高警惕，彻底肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    中国人民银行总行国外业务局王思曙来信：读了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，使我感到极大的愤恨。
    材料证明：胡风和胡风集团是为蒋贼卖国集团和帝国主义服务的。胡风和胡风分子对中国共产党和中国人民有着深仇大恨，他们妄想革命政权“呜呼完蛋”。
    材料证明：胡风集团是一个有组织、有领导、有战术战略的严密的反革命集团。他们的战略战术是卑鄙无耻而又凶狠毒辣的！
    胡风反革命集团终于被揭发，是党和中国人民在对敌斗争上又一次的重大胜利。我们应该响应党的号召，积极参加这一严重的政治斗争，揭发一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    北京市第三十六中学教育工会和教职员团支部来信：我们看了“人民日报”连续发表的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料以后，感到万分愤慨。
    这些材料，有力地证明了：胡风反革命集团是同美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的，这个集团是属于蒋介石匪帮反革命组织的一部分。他们是最卑鄙、最阴险、最凶恶的敌人。我们决不允许人民的死敌，像细菌一样再蔓延下去。我们请求政府要坚决的予以镇压，要把所有的反革命分子坚决彻底消灭干净。
    从胡风事件中，我们要吸取教训。在社会主义建设事业中，阶级斗争更加尖锐了，反革命分子必然要进行破坏活动。我们全体教职员工，一致认为今后要提高政治警惕性，以马克思列宁主义武装自己，和全国人民一道，在党的领导下，为了我们幸福美好的未来，同一切人民的死敌坚决斗争到底。
    中国建筑工会北京市委员会来信：当“人民日报”公布了关于胡风反革命集团的第一、二批材料以后，全北京市建筑职工对胡风反革命集团的罪行都感到极大的愤怒，并一致要求彻底查清胡风反革命集团的一切罪恶活动和政治背景，从严处理。六月十日“人民日报”又公布了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，这批材料进一步证明了胡风和他的一伙，是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的一群反革命分子。他们对新社会、对人民革命政权表现了刻骨的仇恨，咒骂人民革命政权的“灭亡”“完蛋”，疯狂地反对和破坏我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，这是我们工人阶级和全体劳动人民所不能容忍的！
    我们代表北京市建筑工会七万多会员和全体建筑职工，坚决要求根据“惩治反革命条例”，惩处胡风反革命集团分子。
    我们必须从这次的严重事件中吸取教训，提高革命警惕性，更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，把类似胡风集团的一切暗藏的反革命分子，坚决地、彻底地清除出去。
    重工业部研究室徐伯元、陈澄清来信：在批判和揭露胡风反革命集团罪行的过程中，我们一直很麻痹，认为这是文艺界的事，同自己关系不大。看了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，我们的愤怒到了极点。原来胡风和他的反革命集团分子是些别有来历的人，是早就同美蒋反动派有勾结、有联系、长期潜伏在人民内部的反革命分子。看，他们是多么阴险毒辣啊！他们要推翻我们已经取得的革命成果，使六万万人民重过黑暗、贫穷和痛苦的生活。胡风反革命集团是我们每一个爱国公民的共同敌人。
    我们决心参加到这一战斗的行列里来，提高警惕，揭露胡风反革命集团和一切隐藏的坏分子，把那些吃人不吐骨的“老虎”一个个打死。
    武汉钢铁建设公司武昌分公司第四工区施工技术组于洪志等八人来信：我们是基本建设单位的技术人员。通过胡风事件，我们进一步认识了过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性，及反动残余的阴谋活动。我们还能够再麻痹大意吗？今后一定要加强革命警惕性，提高马克思列宁主义水平，随时辨别混入革命事业中的一切隐蔽的敌人，并给以毁灭性的打击。
    北京铁道学院附设工农速成中学王凤等十九人来信：在英明的中国共产党的领导下，对胡风反革命集团罪行的揭露，是革命对反革命斗争的一次巨大胜利。因为像胡风集团这样一个隐藏在革命队伍内的反革命集团，如果让它发展下去，就一定会给祖国社会主义建设事业造成不可计算的损失。
    我们深刻地感到，对胡风集团的罪行的揭露，对我们是一次非常具体的阶级斗争的教育。党屡次教导我们，在过渡时期，阶级斗争是要更加复杂化和尖锐化的。因此我们就必须经常保持高度的政治警惕性。从已经揭露的材料来看，胡风反革命分子经常选择那些思想上有毛病和警惕性差的人作为对象，进行引诱拉拢，使这些人坠入他们的圈套。因此我们每个人，尤其是党员、团员必须提高警惕，必须刻苦地学习马克思列宁主义，武装我们的头脑，以免上反革命分子的当。
    沈阳市北关区顺城街二六四号孙素清来信：我是一个家庭妇女，三个孩子的妈妈。我从报上看到关于胡风反革命集团的材料，知道胡风反革命集团很早就是帝国主义、蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，我心里有说不出来的愤怒。胡风长期以来伪装进步，潜藏在人民的内部，从事阴险的恶毒的反革命活动，妄想摧毁我们的革命政权。胡风就是人民的公敌。我要求政府给胡风和他的集团中的主要反革命分子以严厉的镇压。作为一个家庭妇女，从这个事件里，我也提高了认识，我要将我的小孩培养成爱国家、爱人民的好儿女，还要时刻警惕暗藏的反革命分子。
    克服麻痹思想，学会对两面派分子斗争的本领
    中国科学院古脊椎动物研究所裴文中、贾兰坡等十一人来信：看了揭发胡风反革命集团的三批材料，我们感到无法抑制的愤怒。我们要求一定要把胡风反革命集团彻底粉碎和给以严厉的镇压！
    作为祖国的自然科学工作者，我们不能不问政治。胡风反革命集团的被揭发，使我们认识到：在为祖国的科学事业贡献自己力量的同时，我们还必须加强政治理论学习，提高革命警惕，克服麻痹思想，同各种各样企图潜入革命内部的反革命分子进行斗争！
    中央音乐学院干部进修班丁辛、万苇舟、王莘等十八人来信：我们是一群音乐工作者，目前正在中央音乐学院学习。当我们看到“人民日报”所公布的三批关于胡风反革命集团的材料之后，激起了无比的愤怒。我们清楚地看到了胡风反革命集团的丑恶、阴险的面貌。这是一场革命同反革命之间的激烈斗争，因此绝不能认为同音乐界无关。我们希望一切爱国的音乐工作者都起来同胡风反革命集团进行斗争。我们应从胡风事件中吸取深刻的教训，任何政治上的麻痹和自由主义，对革命事业热情的减低，都会给敌人以可乘的空隙。因此我们要百倍的提高警惕，更紧密地团结在党的旗帜下，为完成我们伟大的社会主义事业而斗争。
    辽宁省农业生产合作社训练班龙亭、师君来信：胡风反革命集团是美蒋特务的一部分，他们有反党反人民反革命的政治纲领、组织原则、斗争的计划和战略战术。他们把自己伪装起来，钻进革命队伍里进行破坏工作。他们比拿枪的敌人更阴险更毒辣。他们是中国人民的死敌，我们再也不能被胡风集团欺骗了。我们要睁大眼睛，提高警惕，把反革命分子清除出去。
    革命残废军人张竹村来信：我是一个残废军人，现在中央民族学院附属中学当工人，以前不知道胡风是干什么的，看到报纸上先后公布的关于胡风反革命集团的材料，才知道胡风和他的喽啰们原来都是蒋介石的忠实的走狗。
    我们革命残废军人，为了人民革命的胜利，曾经流过鲜血。有些战友牺牲了生命。阴险的敌人要破坏我们用生命鲜血换来的胜利果实，是令我们最愤恨的！我希望彻底肃清胡风集团和潜伏在革命队伍中的一切反革命分子，并给予严厉的惩处。
    胡风反革命的真相被揭露了，使我得到了很大的教训。反革命分子是无孔不入的。我们应当时刻提高警惕，努力加强政治学习。只要我们的警觉性很高，不管反革命分子怎样诡计多端，都一定会被我们揭露的。
    上海福光电机制造厂工人张英来信：当报上公布了关于胡风反革命集团的第一、第二批材料后，我对他们的政治背景的认识还是比较模糊的。看了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，才使我猛吃一惊，原来胡风集团的靠山，就是中国人民的死敌——蒋贼！我深深地感到自己的政治嗅觉是太不灵了！感谢党给我们敲起了警钟。是的，垂死的敌人是不会甘心他们的失败的，他们还要作最后挣扎。为了保卫我们的胜利果实，我们必须时刻警惕着，不让反革命分子钻空子。我要求政府逮捕蒋贼的狗腿——胡风、阿垅等反革命分子，依法严惩。
    卫生部行政干部训练班工业卫生班全体学员来信：我们是来自全国各地主要工业部门的在卫生行政干部训练班学习的学员。当我们看到“人民日报”先后公布的关于胡风反革命集团的材料后，感到万分的愤恨！
    胡风集团是一个反党、反人民、反革命的集团，是美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国贼豢养的忠实走狗。他们阴谋进行颠覆活动，妄想使人民政府倒台，使人民革命事业归于失败，使我们再度受到蹂躏。我们绝对不能容许！
    我们也要从胡风反革命集团事件中吸取教训，提高革命警惕。反革命分子是无孔不入的。因此，我们要加强马克思列宁主义的学习，武装自己的头脑，坚决同一切反革命活动作无情的斗争！
    中央戏剧学院表演干部训练班全体教职学员来信：“人民日报”公布了三批关于胡风反革命集团的材料，暴露了胡风集团的真面目。跟蒋介石匪帮一鼻孔出气的胡风反革命集团分子，钻进我们革命机关、学校、团体内部，进行阴谋活动，正如高尔基所比喻的那样，像条虫寄生在人们的肠子里，吸取人们的脂膏滋养着自己，使人们的头脑昏晕而患衰弱症，危害了我们社会主义革命事业。我们表演训练班正以高尔基的杰出的剧本“小市民”做学习的教材，因而对腐朽卑贱的资产阶级个人主义仇视社会主义力量的成长，有了进一步的认识。
    通过胡风集团反革命事件的教训，我们警觉到过去对胡风反革命集团这种绦虫似的敌人的阴谋活动认识不足。感谢党报给我们擦亮了眼睛，我们决心在今后努力学习马克思列宁主义，增强明辨是非、分清敌我的能力，不容反革命分子再在我们面前贩卖私货。我们决心努力进行思想改造，坚决贯彻毛主席的文艺方针，清除反动的文艺思想影响，并且坚决地反对自由主义，防止顾了业务，忘了政治的错误倾向。
    中国人民大学预科一班全体同学来信：我们看了关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，进行了座谈。胡风集团的罪行，激起了我们心中无比的愤怒。
    我们二十六名同学，虽然都还年轻，但每一个人都有过一段悲惨的生活经历。在旧社会里，我们有的在十多岁时走进了工厂，从事繁重的劳动，过着非人的生活；有的从小就给地主扛活，打短工；有的人是在日本帝国主义残酷统治下度过他们童年的。我们没有一个人得到过几天温饱的生活。好容易在党的领导下，我们得到了解放，翻了身，当家做了主人。我们被党送到了中国人民大学来学习。我们之中的陈树兰同志还被选为全国人民代表大会的代表。这些，都是我们过去连想也不敢想的事情，但现在都实现了。
    我们非常清楚这些幸福是怎样得来的，难道我们能容反革命复辟再来重新压迫剥削我们吗？不能！万万不能！我们要求严惩破坏我们幸福生活的胡风反革命集团。并决心从胡风事件中吸取教训，努力学习，提高政治觉悟，永远对党忠诚。我们不仅要学会建设祖国的本领，而且要学会阶级斗争的本领，以便为建设祖国，保卫祖国而贡献出我们的青春和力量。
    彻底消灭暗藏敌人，保卫祖国建设
    中国作家协会西安分会会员杜鹏程、魏钢焰及人民解放军铁道兵文艺工作者冼频等二十七人来信：我们是在铁路工地上体验生活的一批文艺工作者。在我们和铁道兵部队生活在一起的日子里，亲身感受到人民铁道兵的革命英雄气概。他们不论在酷夏严寒、狂风暴雨里，都是以高昂的战斗精神，抢建着祖国的铁路；很多铁路上，都留下他们那不可磨灭的脚迹指印，都洒过他们的汗水。我们深以没有充分反映出英雄们可歌可泣的伟大业绩而自责。但当我们正策励自己深入生活、创作无愧于英雄部队的作品的时候，看到了胡风的反党、反革命的“意见书”。这个阴险的反革命分子不遗余力地要人们放弃文学的党性立场，抛弃社会主义现实主义的原则，离开人民利益和火热的斗争去“自我扩张”，从而达到其断送人民文学事业的恶毒目的。这是多么狠毒呵！
    最近，我们看到了“人民日报”公布的几批材料，更使我们知道胡风集团是个有组织，有计划的，有极大野心的同人民革命事业誓不两立的反革命组织。我们决不能容忍反革命分子胡风之流对党和人民革命事业的侮辱和污蔑！我们要坚决粉碎胡风反革命集团，保卫我们祖国的建设事业，保卫我们的理想！我们要求依法惩办万恶的反革命分子胡风及其反革命集团中死不悔悟的胡风分子！
    福建前线某建设工地庄建国来信：读了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的材料，我抑制不住心中的愤怒！我要求政府严惩反革命分子胡风！
    在福建前线，我们看到过盘旋在我们头上的敌机，看到过海面上的敌舰向我们美丽的家乡进行轰击，听到过隔海敌人的“反攻大陆”的叫嚣，也受到过钻进或潜伏在我们内部的特务分子的破坏。我们完全懂得敌人的阴险、凶狠和毒辣，也懂得只有消灭敌人，才能保卫革命，保卫社会主义的建设。
    胡风集团的罪恶不就是配合蒋介石卖国集团飞机、大炮的轰击吗？不就是配合蒋介石卖国集团
  “反攻大陆”的叫嚣吗？胡风和我们隔海的敌人是完全一样的。我们要坚决彻底地粉碎胡风反革命集团的活动。我们要提高警惕，随时准备粉碎一切拿枪的和不拿枪的敌人。
    中国人民解放军某部战士黄修仁、王来同等五人来信：看了“人民日报”公布的胡风反革命集团的三批材料后，我们这里所有的同志，都感到非常愤慨。我们要求人民政府对胡风反革命集团给以彻底的粉碎，对其中罪大恶极的和执迷不悟的顽固分子加以坚决镇压！
    我们表示：今后一定要更加百倍警惕地保卫祖国的社会主义建设，坚决摧毁一切反革命分子及帝国主义分子的任何阴谋，我们不仅要练好同持枪的敌人作斗争的本领，而且也要和全国人民一道学会同暗藏在人民内部的反革命分子作斗争的本领，把他们彻底地从人民内部清洗出去，使我们的祖国能顺利地在党和毛主席的领导下过渡到社会主义社会。
    广播事业局机关工会委员会来信：关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料公布以后，胡风反革命集团的真实面目大白于天下了。我们坚决要求政府依法严惩怙恶不悛的胡风反革命集团分子。
    通过胡风事件，我们又受到一次实际的阶级教育。我们更深刻地体会到过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性。我们决心加强马克思列宁主义的学习，更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，提高警惕，克服麻痹思想，积极地投入到这个严重斗争中来，进一步做好本岗位的工作，和全国人民一道，坚决彻底地把一切反革命分子肃清，以保证胜利完成祖国的社会主义建设事业。
    中国百货公司樊陶斋来信：胡风反革命集团的被揭发，是党领导中国人民进行革命斗争过程中所取得的又一次巨大胜利。在胡风思想批判展开后，我曾以为自己是国营商业部门的工作人员，胡风事件不过是文艺界的事，和我们国营商业部门工作人员是没有关系的。看了“人民日报”上公布的第三批材料，我才感到自己的政治警惕性是不高的。现在，我们的思想再不能麻痹了。我们要积极参加战斗，把这批反革命分子清除出去，并把其他一切暗藏在我们队伍中的反革命分子坚决、彻底、干尽、全部地清除出去！
    江苏省震泽县横泾收购站钱英来信：“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的三批材料，我已经全部阅读过。我和全国人民一样，对这个反革命集团有着无比的痛恨。
    从胡风事件中，我更深刻地体会到目前阶级斗争的尖锐化和复杂性。如果不提高政治警惕性，敌人就会钻到我们的内部来进行破坏。我是一个农村青年，又是基干民兵（目前，在收购站做临时工作），我一定做好地方治安工作，监视坏分子，防止他们的破坏活动，这样才能保卫我们的生产和社会主义建设。
    长沙海员工人陈熙、徐礼成来信：从胡风事件中，我们认识到暗藏的反革命分子是千方百计无孔不入地在阴谋破坏我们的建设事业的。因此我们必须提高警惕，充分认识过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂和尖锐，必须更深刻地认识斗争形式的多种多样，学会辨别伪装的和暗藏的敌人的本领。我们要紧密地团结在党的周围，加强党的力量，为粉碎一切反革命活动，保卫我们的社会主义建设而斗争。
    建筑工程部设计总局司徒奋生来信：我是生长在国外的一个侨民。一九五○年我才回到祖国来。回到祖国后，我亲眼看到了祖国的人民在党的领导下以最快的速度，克服了一切困难，恢复了被国民党反动派弄得残破不堪的国民经济，并且开始了伟大的社会主义建设事业。我眼看着祖国一天比一天繁荣，一天比一天更富强，心里真是兴奋、快乐。我觉得回到祖国以后才真正是过着有意义的生活，才真正是过着自由幸福的生活。可是，对这样伟大、可爱的新生的祖国，对充满着这样美好的生活的新社会，胡风分子却充满了仇恨，说什么“对这个社会秩序，我憎恨”，他们还“几乎恨一切人”。很明显，胡风反革命集团是狂热地希望我们的人民政权“呜呼完蛋”的，狂热地幻想着反动派能复辟，卷土重来，企图使我国人民重陷于万劫不复的痛苦之中，使海外华侨重又失去自己亲爱的祖国。可是，我们要向胡风反革命集团大喝一声：胡风，这是你们的梦想！我们全国人民在共产党的领导下正胜利地建设着社会主义。“呜呼完蛋”的不是我们，而正是你们这些反革命分子和你们的主子——蒋介石残余匪帮。
    中国人民解放军某部休养员孙建华来信：我是人民解放军的一个战士，是个躺在病床上的病人。重病施手术后刀口未愈，我的痛苦是可想而知的，但是这一切我都能忍耐。可是看到揭露胡风反革命集团的第三批材料后，胡风集团的阴险恶毒，却使我感到比疾病给我的折磨更难受。我实在压不住我的愤怒了。
    这批反革命分子比拿枪的敌人还可恶。他们对蒋贼发动的反人民的内战感到“鼓舞”和“乐观”，说什么“因国军频频收复，人心已定”。历史难道是他们能歪曲的么？我们很多人都是这段历史的见证人。我的家乡就曾一度被蒋匪侵占。敌人的残暴现在在我的记忆里也还异常清晰。他们在一个不到四十万人的县里仅三个月就杀了上万的老百姓，有时一坑埋数百人。他们用“机枪点名”“杀头示众”“活埋”等等惨无人道的办法来对付革命的人民。而胡风分子竟说这是“人心已定”。这除了说明他们是蒋贼的同伙之外，还能说明什么呢？我要求严惩这些反革命罪犯，并决心努力养好身体，学好技术，随时准备着响应党的号召，去歼灭一切敌人！
    华北农业科学研究所发育生物学系全体职工来信：看了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的材料以后，我们对这些反革命分子的罪恶活动，感到无限的愤怒和痛恨。我们要求坚决镇压这批人面兽心的阶级敌人，把这些反革命分子彻底肃清。
    全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，为争取我们祖国的社会主义工业化而忘我地劳动着。这些反革命分子却钻进革命队伍里，暗中进行阴谋破坏活动，企图从思想上解除我们的武装，使我们脱离社会主义建设的轨道，使反动政权复辟。这种用心是多么阴险啊！我们绝对不能容忍！
    胡风反革命集团的被揭发，使我们清楚地认识到：作为热爱祖国的公民，愿把一切力量贡献给党的事业的人们，必需更好地提高自己的政治觉悟和警惕性，我们要学会善于辨别隐藏的敌人的本领。这样不论敌人多么狡猾，隐蔽的多么严密，我们也一定能够及时地揭发他们，惩办他们。
    甘肃省舟曲洛大直属乡人民政府藏族干部李世馨、韩世明来信：胡风反革命集团的真相被揭穿了。原来他们是同美蒋匪帮有着密切联系的。一提起美蒋匪帮过去对我们少数民族的血腥统治，我们每个藏族同胞都无不切齿痛恨。获得了解放的我们藏族同胞，同各兄弟民族一样，享受到了民族平等权利，生活在自由、幸福、友爱的祖国大家庭里，决不愿意让美蒋匪帮再来压在我们头上。但胡风却希望美蒋匪帮卷土重来，因此他就是我们的死敌，我们要求政府严厉地惩处他。
