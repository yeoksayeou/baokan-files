At the Dalian Paint Factory, there was such an "engineer": When he first arrived, he seemed very active, proactively made plans, and even offered a suggestion. But after a while, when the leadership showed trust in him and put him in charge of key production links, he slowly revealed his true colors. For example, upon hearing of an important order, he would try to take it over, and then delay delivery with various excuses. When an urgent task came, all the workers actively tried to find ways to ensure its completion, but he tried every possible means to sabotage it. When an accident occurred, all the workers were very sad, but he secretly rejoiced, and stirred up trouble among the workers. His technical skills were no problem when not displayed, but once displayed, accidents affecting production would occur somewhere, and at first glance, it seemed the problem lay in "objective reasons"... This "engineer" was named Sun Yishan. Recently, he was stripped of his technical personnel disguise and revealed to be a downright counter-revolutionary. Based on reports from the masses, the Lüda Public Security Bureau arrested him according to law on December 24, 1954. After public prosecution by the Lüda Municipal People's Procuratorate, the Lüda District Intermediate People's Court of Liaoning Province held a public trial on April 9 this year. Based on Sun Yishan's counter-revolutionary crimes, he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison and deprived of political rights for five years.

The counter-revolutionary Sun Yishan joined the Three People's Principles Youth League in 1938 and the Kuomintang in 1944. Before liberation, he served as a lecturer and professor at Northeastern University, and held positions such as technical specialist in the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Construction of the Kuomintang, director of the Industrial Experiment Institute, engineer of an enterprise company, and director of a chemical factory. After liberation, during the land reform, the land he rented out in Faku County, Liaoning, was confiscated and distributed to the peasants. This counter-revolutionary, who had long relied on imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to oppress the people, could neither arbitrarily bully the people in a country where the people were in power, nor was he willing to reform himself and start anew. He vainly attempted to restore his past life, dreaming day and night of Chiang Kai-shek's "counter-attack on the mainland." Therefore, when American imperialism launched the war of aggression in Korea, he secretly rejoiced. At that time, a counter-revolutionary asked him to find a job, and he said: "The Korean War will be won by the United Nations within two or three months, and the Central Army will definitely return to the Northeast. At that time, I can guarantee you a county magistrate, and I'm only afraid you won't like being one!"

In 1951, disguised as a technical personnel, he went to the Dalian Paint Factory as chief engineer. Because Sun Yishan used his position to sabotage production, the factory failed to complete the trial production of new products in two years, and almost none of the old products met the quality standards.

Sun Yishan exploited the factory leaders' lack of technical knowledge, using his legal position to sabotage production in a crazy manner using covert means. Once, the factory accepted the urgent task of trial-producing an important paint used in a national construction project. At the beginning of production, the workshop director and workers raised concerns to Sun Yishan, reflecting that the paint quality did not meet specifications and would change color. Sun said, "Let's study it." Until the entire task was completed, he didn't "study" anything. After the paint was shipped, the workshop director, technicians, and engineers inspected the remaining finished products in the warehouse and found that they had all changed color. In August 1953, the factory accepted the task of trial-producing a coating. Sun Yishan knew this was a major matter, so he deliberately concocted a rough formula, deceiving the state organs into accepting this non-guaranteed paint. The technicians did not trust the formula and insisted on successful trial production before production; the trial production task should be carried out quickly. But Sun Yishan deliberately said that this formula was foolproof, first preventing trial production, and then delaying it in every possible way, finally causing the task to fail.

Sun Yishan not only issued formulas that had not been successfully trial-produced to the workshop for mass production, but also secretly altered formulas that had already been successfully trial-produced, resulting in a large number of substandard products, deliberately damaging state property and hindering the completion of tasks. Once, the factory needed to produce a batch of clear varnish, and workshop technician Shi Yuzhang sent the already successfully trial-produced formula to Sun Yishan for review. Sun Yishan picked up a pen and changed the formula: increasing the amount of gasoline by more than double and reducing the amount of turpentine by half. Shi Yuzhang disagreed, pointing out that using too much gasoline would affect the quality. Seeing that Shi Yuzhang insisted on his opinion, Sun Yishan was forced to change it back and told Shi Yuzhang to explain it if the factory director asked. But Sun Yishan was not reconciled and still looked for opportunities to actively sabotage. Technician Yu Yongxue had previously experimented with tung oil to make clear oil, using only 25% tung oil, but the resulting clear oil was too viscous and unusable. Yu Yongxue told Sun Yishan about this result. But soon when a certain company and the Lüda Coal Construction Company ordered clear oil, Sun Yishan secretly opened a formula using 30% tung oil, while the factory director was away from home, and let the workshop produce it. As a result, 32.5 tons of clear oil were produced, all of which were unqualified, delaying the urgent needs of the two companies.

Sun Yishan often deliberately delayed the state's urgent orders with various excuses. When the factory accepted an urgent order, he also shouted that the task was "important," but he did not try to produce it at all. When the ordering department urged him, he often used excuses such as "no raw materials" to prevaricate. Although some raw materials were not easy to buy at that time, the raw material problem was not unsolvable in reality. For example, for a certain spray paint, Sun Yishan insisted that a certain raw material must account for about 44%. Because this raw material could not be bought for a while, the ordering party asked whether it could be used less or not at all, but Sun flatly refused. Later, technicians' actual tests proved that this raw material only needed to be used 15%, and even the required paint could be manufactured without using this raw material. But Sun Yishan insisted that it was not possible to use so little. Because the ordering department urgently needed paint, the deputy director convened a meeting, explaining that the state needed it urgently, and the technicians also proved that it could be used less. Sun had no answer and was forced to agree to do an experiment. But after the meeting, he did not do the experiment, so this batch of urgent orders was delayed from August 1953 to July 1954, causing great losses to the state. When accepting another batch of urgent orders for high-grade spray paint, Sun Yishan also claimed that production was impossible without a certain raw material. Technician Wang Xichang studied the use of another raw material as a substitute, and after experimenting, sent two samples to Sun Yishan, one using a certain raw material and one using a substitute raw material. The results of the two were similar, and theoretically there was sufficient basis for substitution. Sun replied at the time, "Let's study it." The second time Wang Xichang went to Sun Yishan, Sun Yishan flatly said: "No!" But he couldn't give a reason. After delaying for more than a month, it was finally possible to buy a certain raw material. Sun Yishan then asked another technician to study whether Wang Xichang's research on the substitute raw material could replace the certain raw material. However, the technician knew the chemical properties and similarities and differences between these two raw materials, and Sun Yishan also understood it long ago. He did this just to deliberately deceive people!

In fact, even if the supply of raw materials was sufficient, he would still delay the task. In October 1952, a batch of nitro putty needed to be trial-produced. The task was very important, but Sun Yishan did not ask or hear about it during the trial production period. After five months of trial production, a factory had already stopped work and was waiting for materials due to a lack of nitro putty. The ordering department requested the Dalian Paint Factory to first borrow data from the Shenyang Paint Factory (which had produced it in the past), manufacture some for emergency use, and then continue to trial-produce nitro putty with better quality. Sun Yishan refused to do so and still pushed it off as "experimentation." The factory director instructed the clerk to write a letter to request the data, but Sun openly prevented the clerk from writing the letter.

In order to achieve the purpose of sabotaging production, Sun Yishan also often suppressed rationalization proposals. Once, when producing oil-based varnish, Sun Yishan stipulated the use of a certain crude oil. Workshop director Pan Laiming believed that this crude oil had many shortcomings based on past experience and suggested using a refined No. XX clear oil instead. But Sun Yishan did not consider Pan's correct opinion, nor did he conduct small-scale experiments, and ordered the workshop to produce with crude oil, resulting in waste products and great losses. When producing a certain product, Sun Yishan insisted on using iron oxide with a content of 52%, but it was not available on the market. Someone suggested using iron oxide with a content of 40+ % instead, but Sun said no. The inspection section chief saw that production would stop and supply would be affected if this continued, and considering that qualified products had been made in the past without using 52% iron oxide, he decided to use iron oxide with a content of 40+ % for testing first, and the results met the specifications. When producing other products, many employees also put forward various rationalization proposals, but all rationalization proposals were unreasonably opposed by Sun Yishan. In this way, Sun Yishan used his position as an engineer to stifle the enthusiasm and creativity of employees and hinder the improvement of production.

But Sun Yishan actively supported unreasonable suggestions that had a destructive effect on production. For example, a product produced by the paint factory was for rust prevention. Anyone with a little scientific knowledge would know that things containing salt tend to rust metal. But once the factory received a batch of raw materials that were of poor quality. At this time, someone suggested adding a little salt when melting it into a liquid. At that time, the workshop technician disagreed, but he approved it and made a batch. As a result, the products made with this raw material not only could not prevent rust, but would cause rust. Later, fortunately, the factory director discovered it and corrected it.

In order to sabotage production, Sun Yishan not only supported other people's wrong suggestions, but also deliberately put forward some suggestions that harmed production himself. For example, after a certain furnace was overhauled, the temperature did not meet the requirements. At this time, everyone was busy looking for problems, but he proposed a risky method—adding fire to burn the empty furnace. If his suggestion was followed, the entire furnace would have to be burned down and production would have to stop. Fortunately, everyone opposed it and avoided this loss. Later, after inspection, it was found that there was only a problem with the flue. Obviously, as an engineer, putting forward this obviously unreasonable suggestion was by no means an accidental mistake, but a manifestation of a premeditated conspiracy to sabotage production.

    反革命分子孙移山在大连油漆厂所进行的技术破坏
    程维君　先智
    在大连油漆厂里，有这样一个“工程师”：刚来的时候，表现得很积极，主动作过计划，还提出过一项建议。可是过了不久，当领导上对他表示信任并让他掌握了生产关键环节的时候，他就慢慢地露出真面目来了。比如，听到有重要订货，他就想法包揽来，然后以各种借口拖延不交货。来了紧急任务，全体职工都积极想办法保证完成任务，他却千方百计地从中破坏。出了事故，全体职工都很难过，他却暗暗喜欢，并且在职工中间进行挑拨。他的技术不施展便罢，一施展，就不知会在哪个地方出现影响生产的事故，而且冷丁一看似乎毛病出在“客观原因”身上……。这位“工程师”叫孙移山，最近被剥去了技术人员的外衣，原来是一个不折不扣的反革命分子。旅大市公安局根据群众的检举，在一九五四年十二月二十四日依法将他逮捕了，后经旅大市人民检察院提起公诉，今年四月九日，辽宁省旅大地区中级人民法院举行公判庭，根据孙移山的反革命罪行，判处他十五年徒刑，剥夺政治权利五年。
    反革命分子孙移山在一九三八年参加三青团，一九四四年参加国民党。解放前，他担任过东北大学的讲师和教授，做过国民党陕西省建设厅技正，工业试验所所长，企业公司工程师兼化学厂厂长等职务。解放后，实行土地改革，他在辽宁法库县出租的土地被没收分给农民。这个长期依赖帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的反革命统治以压迫人民为生的反革命分子，在人民当权的国家里，既不能任意鱼肉人民，横行霸道，又不愿改造自己重新作人，他就妄想恢复过去的生活，日日夜夜做着蒋介石“反攻大陆”的梦。因此，当美帝国主义在朝鲜发动了侵略战争时，他暗中非常喜欢。正在那时，有一个反革命分子托他找职业，他说：“朝鲜战争在两三月以内，联合国一定会胜利，中央军一定会回东北，到那时我可保证你当个县长，还只怕你不喜欢当呢！”
    一九五一年，他披着技术人员的外衣，到大连油漆厂当上了主任工程师。由于孙移山利用职权，破坏生产，这个厂在两年中都没有完成新产品的试制任务，而旧产品中也几乎没有一种在质量上是合乎标准的。
    孙移山钻了厂的领导干部不懂技术的空子，利用合法地位，采取隐蔽的手段来疯狂地破坏生产。有一回，这个厂接受了试制国家某项建设中用的一种重要油漆的紧急任务，生产一开始，车间主任和工人都向孙移山提出意见，反映油漆质量不合乎规格，会变颜色。孙说：“研究研究看。”直到全部任务完成，也没见他“研究”了什么。油漆发走以后，车间主任、技术员和工程师在仓库检查剩下的成品，一看都变了色。一九五三年八月，这个工厂接受了试制一种涂料的任务。孙移山知道这是关系重大的事情，就故意马马虎虎弄了个配方，欺骗国家机关把这种不保用的油漆接收去。技术员不相信这个配方，提出一定要试制成功然后再生产；试制任务应该赶快进行。但孙移山却故意说这个配方有十分把握，先是不让试制，以后又百般拖延，终于使任务没完成。
    孙移山不但把未经试制成功的配方发给车间去大批生产，有时还偷改已经试制成功的配方，以致造成大量产品不合规格，故意损害国家财产，阻碍任务的完成。一次，厂里要生产一批清漆，车间技术员石玉章把已经试制成功的配方送给孙移山审查。孙移山拿起笔来把配方涂改了：把汽油量增加了一倍多，松节油减少了一半。石玉章不同意，指出汽油用多了会影响质量。孙移山见石玉章坚持意见，才被迫改了回来，并告诉石玉章，厂长如果问起，给解释一下。但孙移山并不甘心，还是寻找机会积极破坏。技术员余永斅过去试验用桐油做清油，仅用了百分之二十五的桐油，做出来的清油黏度太大，不合用。余永斅把这个结果告诉了孙移山。但不久当某公司和旅大煤建公司订购清油时，孙移山趁厂长不在家，偷偷地开了用桐油百分之三十的配方，让车间生产，结果生产出三十二点五吨清油全部不合格，耽误了两家公司的急用。
    孙移山时常以各种口实故意耽误国家的紧急订货。工厂接受了紧急订货，他也叫嚷任务“重要”，可是他根本不去试制。订货部门催了，他就常常以
  “没有原料”等借口来搪塞。当时有些原料虽然不容易买到，但实际上原料问题并不是不能解决的。如有一种喷漆，孙移山坚持某种原料须占百分之四十四左右，因为一时买不到这种原料，订货方面提出是否能少用或者不用，孙一口拒绝。以后由技术员实际试验证明这种原料只用百分之十五就可以了，甚至不用这种原料也可以制造所需要的漆。但是孙移山却硬说非用那末多不行。因订货部门急等用漆，副厂长召开了一次会议，说明国家需要迫切，技术人员也证明可以少用，孙无言答对，被迫同意作一次试验。但是会议结束后，他也没有作试验，以致把这批紧急订货从一九五三年八月直拖到一九五四年七月，使国家受到莫大的损失。在接受另一批高级喷漆的紧急订货时，孙移山也提出没有某种原料不能生产。技术员王喜昌研究用另一种原料代替，并且作了试验后送了两块样板给孙移山看，一块是用的某种原料，一块是用代用原料，两块的结果是差不多的，同时从理论上说也有足够的根据可以代替。孙当时回答“研究研究”。第二次王喜昌又去找孙移山，孙移山斩钉截铁地说：“不行！”可又说不出理由。拖延了一个多月，好容易买到某种原料了，孙移山却又让另一技术员去研究王喜昌研究的代用原料能不能代替某种原料。然而这两种原料的化学性能和异同点，技术员知道，孙移山也早明白，他这样做只不过是故意遮人耳目罢了！
    其实，即使原料供应充足，他也照样要拖延任务的。一九五二年十月间需要试制一批硝基腻子，任务很重要，试制期间孙移山不问不闻。一直试制了五个月，有一个工厂已经因缺硝基腻子而停工待料。订货部门要求大连油漆厂先借沈阳油漆厂的资料（过去生产过）一面制造一些以应急用，一面再继续试制质量较好的硝基腻子。孙移山不肯这样做，仍推说“试验试验”。厂长指示文书写信去索取资料，孙还明目张胆不让文书写信。
    为了达到破坏生产的目的，孙移山还经常压制合理化建议。有一次在生产油性清漆时，孙移山规定用某种原油，车间主任潘来铭根据过去的经验，认为这种原油有很多缺点，建议改用精制过的某号清油。但孙移山不考虑潘的正确意见，又不进行小型试验，即令车间用原油生产，结果造成废品，损失很大。在生产一种产品时，孙移山坚持要用含量百分之五十二的氧化铁，但市场上买不到。有人建议用百分之四十几的氧化铁代替，孙说不行。检查科长看到这样下去要停止生产、影响供应，并考虑到过去不用百分之五十二的氧化铁也做出过合格的产品，于是便决定用含量百分之四十几的氧化铁先进行试验，结果达到了规格。在生产其他产品时，也有许多职工提出了各种各样的合理化建议，但是所有的合理化建议都遭到了孙移山的无理反对。孙移山就这样利用工程师的职权，扼杀职工的积极性和创造性，阻碍生产的改进。
    但是对生产起破坏作用的不合理建议，孙移山却积极支持。如油漆厂生产的一种产品是为了防锈用的。稍有一点科学知识的人都会知道，含有盐质的东西容易使金属生锈。但是有一次工厂来了一批原料，质量不好。这时有人提出在溶化成液体的时候加一点盐的办法。当时车间技术员不同意，而他却批准这样做，并且做了一批。结果，用这种原料做出的产品不但不能防锈，反而会生锈。后来幸亏被厂长发现了，才把它纠正过来。
    孙移山为了破坏生产，不但支持别人错误的建议，而且自己也有意提出一些危害生产的建议。如某号炉检修之后，温度达不到要求。这时大家都忙着找毛病，而他却提出冒险的办法——加火烧空炉。如果照他的意见做，整个炉子得烧垮，生产得停顿下来。幸亏经大家一致反对，才避免了这次损失。后来经过检查，发现只是烟道有毛病。很显然，身为工程师提出这种很明显不合理的建议，决不是偶然的过失，而是处心积虑破坏生产的阴谋的表露。
