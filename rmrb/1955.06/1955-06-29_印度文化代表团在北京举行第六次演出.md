    印度文化代表团在北京举行第六次演出
    新华社二十八日讯印度文化代表团二十八日晚在北京举行第六次演出。
    首都四千多人今晚在劳动剧场再次欣赏了印度优美的艺术表演。自从他们在劳动剧场举行卓越成功的演出后，北京各界人民询问和盼望他们再次公演的电话，就接连不断地打到劳动剧场来。印度艺术家们从东北返京后，这种盼望他们演出的电话，更加频繁起来。当他们将再次在京公演的消息传出后，从二十七日清晨直到二十八日黄昏，前来购票的人始终络绎不绝。可是，戏票在二十七日中午一小时内就全部售完。
    舞蹈家克·库蒂的表演，今晚再次把观众带进了奇幻多变而又有趣动人的意境中。他在暴风雨般的掌声中，曾向观众谢了七次幕。
    今晚，印度艺术家们演出了包括流行印度各地的十三个舞蹈和音乐节目。其中有充满了快乐的幻想的提拉纳舞，柔和轻盈的卡塔克舞，优雅的纱里舞，快乐的曼尼普利舞和来自民间的兰巴第民间舞及那加族舞；有抒情的瑟路达独奏，嘹亮的萨朗基独奏，典雅的锡达尔独奏和快乐、豪放的各种民歌独唱。演出毕，一群北京青年艺术工作者走上台来向他们献花。这时全场起立，无数人拥向台前，鼓掌达数分钟，向印度艺术家们杰出的表演表示敬意。
