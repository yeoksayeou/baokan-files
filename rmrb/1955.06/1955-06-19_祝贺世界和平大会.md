    Congratulations to the World Peace Congress
    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    The World Peace Congress is about to open in Helsinki. The Chinese trade unions warmly endorse this congress and support it.
    The imperialists are painstakingly preparing for wars of aggression, while the people of the world are resolutely opposed to war and demand peace. The struggle between the forces of world peace and the forces of aggression is extremely acute.
   The forces of peace have compelled the imperialist elements to stop the Korean War and the war in Indochina, but they—the imperialists—are not reconciled. Since the Geneva Conference, American imperialism has intensified its interference in our country's liberation of Taiwan in the East, and has cobbled together the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization; in the West, it has concluded the Paris Agreements, actively reviving West German militarism. The situation in the East and West has been made very tense by them again. However, the development of the forces of peace has not lagged behind them, but has surpassed them. The holding of the Asian-African Conference, the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between the Eight European Countries, the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, and the further close and improved relations between countries upholding peace... all these have excited and encouraged the peace-loving people of the world.
    More and more people in the world have come to understand the language of the imperialist elements. People understand that what they call "defense" is aggression; what they call "aid" and "cooperation" is controlling other countries' economies, interfering in other countries' internal affairs, and abolishing other countries' independence. The clearer people see the true colors of the imperialist elements, the more difficult it will be for their conspiracies and tricks to succeed.
    The convening of this World Peace Congress will further strengthen the forces of peace and make a great contribution to the cause of peace. The convening of the World Peace Congress will attract and mobilize more people to participate in the peace movement and confidently subdue the warmongers.
    The working class in all countries has always been the strongest fighter for peace. The trade union organizations in many countries are also sincere supporters of the cause of peace. In May of this year, 213 representatives from 71 trade union organizations in 15 countries of Asia and Africa held a friendly and harmonious forum in Beijing. The representatives expressed the common aspirations of the working class of Asia and Africa, which are: to defend peace and oppose wars of aggression; to advocate striving for and defending national independence and opposing colonialism; to demand the prohibition of the manufacture, stockpiling and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and to advocate the peaceful use of atomic energy for the benefit of mankind; and to demand the strengthening of the international friendly unity of the working class in Asian and African countries. These are also the common aspirations of all peace-loving and just people in the world. This World Peace Congress will express this noble and sacred aspiration of the people of the world.
    The Chinese trade unions are working hard to strengthen contacts and solidarity with the working class and trade union organizations of all countries, and striving to fulfill their responsibilities in the cause of defending peace. We firmly stand with the peace-loving people of the world and faithfully implement the resolutions of the World Peace Congress.
    I wish the congress success.

### 祝贺世界和平大会

    祝贺世界和平大会
    中华全国总工会主席　赖若愚
    世界和平大会就要在赫尔辛基开幕了。中国工会热烈地拥护这个大会，支持这个大会。
    帝国主义者处心积虑地准备侵略战争，全世界人民却是坚决地反对战争，要求和平。世界和平力量和侵略势力的斗争是十分尖锐的。
   和平的力量曾迫使帝国主义分子停止了朝鲜战争和印度支那战争，但是它们——帝国主义并不甘心。自从日内瓦会议以后，美帝国主义在东方加紧了对于我国解放台湾的干涉，并且拼凑了所谓东南亚防御集团，在西方缔结了巴黎协定，积极地复活西德军国主义。东方和西方的局势又被他们弄得很紧张。不过，和平力量的发展，并没有落在他们后面，而且超过了他们。亚非会议的举行，欧洲八国友好合作互助条约的签订，奥地利国家条约的签订，拥护和平的国家之间的关系进一步密切和改善，……都使全世界爱好和平的人民为之兴奋鼓舞。
    世界上，已经有越来越多的人懂得了帝国主义分子的语言。人们懂得：他们所说的“防御”就是侵略；他们所说的“援助”、“合作”，就是控制别国的经济，干涉别国的内政，取消别国的独立。人们越是看清楚帝国主义分子的嘴脸，他们的阴谋、诡计就越是难以得逞。
    这次世界和平大会的召开，将更加壮大和平力量，将对和平事业作出巨大的贡献。世界和平大会的召开，将吸引、动员更多的人参加到和平运动中来，满怀信心地去制服好战分子。
    各国的工人阶级，始终是最坚强的和平战士。许多国家的工会组织，也是和平事业的衷心拥护者。今年五月间，亚洲和非洲十五个国家的七十一个工会组织的二百一十三位代表，在北京举行了一个友好、融洽的座谈会。代表们表达了亚非工人阶级的共同愿望，这就是：要求保卫和平，反对侵略战争；主张争取和保卫民族独立，反对殖民主义；要求禁止制造、储存和使用原子武器和氢武器，主张和平利用原子能以造福于人类；要求加强亚非各国工人阶级的国际友好团结。这些，也是世界上一切爱好和平和正义的人民的共同愿望。这次世界和平大会将表达全世界人民的这种高尚的、神圣的愿望。
    中国工会正在努力加强和各国工人阶级、工会组织的联系和团结，努力在保卫和平的事业中尽到自己的责任。我们坚决地和全世界爱好和平的人民站在一起，忠实地执行世界和平大会的决议。
    祝大会成功。
