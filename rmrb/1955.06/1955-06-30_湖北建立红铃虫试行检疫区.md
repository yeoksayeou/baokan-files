Hubei Province's cotton production has been significantly reduced each year due to the pink bollworm infestation. After the severe floods of 1954, the pink bollworm in some flooded areas was completely eradicated. Taking advantage of this favorable condition, Hubei Province has decided this year to establish a "Pink Bollworm Trial Quarantine Zone" (i.e., "Pink Bollworm-Free Demonstration Zone") in eight counties, including Jianli, Huangmei, and Hanchuan, and the suburban area of Wuhan. These areas have already demarcated the boundaries of the quarantine zone and the surrounding buffer zones. The total cultivated cotton field within the quarantine zones amounts to more than 1.34 million mu, accounting for 15.7% of the province's total cultivated cotton field. It is estimated that ensuring such a large area is free of pink bollworm will increase cotton production by more than 6.05 million jin. Within the quarantine zone, all improved cotton seeds that have been sterilized by fumigation have been sown this year. The local seeds purchased by some cotton farmers themselves, because they have not been fumigated, have been purchased or exchanged by the government. Each quarantine zone has also inspected the warehouses of cotton ginning mills and oil companies within the zone to prevent overwintering pink bollworms. To ensure the safety of the quarantine zone, the provincial supply and marketing cooperative plans to supply more than 1 million jin of "666" and "DDT" and 10,000 sprayers and other pesticides, one-third of which have already been shipped to the quarantine zones.

    湖北建立红铃虫试行检疫区
    湖北省棉花因受红铃虫的危害，每年减产很多。一九五四年大水以后，部分被淹地区的红铃虫全部死亡。利用这个有利条件，湖北省今年决定在监利、黄梅、汉川等八个县和武汉市郊区，建立“红铃虫试行检疫区”（即“无红铃虫示范区”）。这些地区已经划定了检疫区的范围，以及检疫区四周的保护带，各地检疫区的实播棉田一共有一百三十四万多亩，占全省实播棉田百分之十五点七，预计这样大的面积确保无红铃虫，将可以增产皮棉六百零五万多斤。在检疫区的范围内，今年全部播种了经过药剂薰蒸灭虫的改良棉种，部分棉农自己购进的土种，因为没有经过薰蒸，已经由政府收购或换回。各检疫区还检查了区内轧花厂和油脂公司的仓库，防治越冬的红铃虫。为了确保检疫区的安全，省供销合作社计划供应的一百多万斤“六六六”和“滴滴涕”和一万部喷雾器等药械，已经有三分之一运到了各检疫区。　（袁军）
