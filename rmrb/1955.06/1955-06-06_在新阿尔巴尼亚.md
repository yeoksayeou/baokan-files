    In New Albania
    By De Shutriqi, Chairman of the Albanian Writers' Association

    Whenever I travel in my country, I often recall a trip I took more than thirty years ago. At that time, my father had just received an appointment to teach at a middle school in the city of Korçë in southern Albania. We traveled from our hometown of Elbasan. My father hired three horses to move our small family. My sister and I sat in two wooden boxes placed on the saddles. Although it was a bit crowded, it was comfortable, and especially interesting. However, this move took three days and was really tiring. We spent two nights in mountain village inns during the journey. I will always remember these small inns: a large room, the only room, without windows or a ceiling, the roof made of rows of black rafters. A large fire burned in the middle of the room, and travelers slept around the fire. The horses rested and neighed nearby, and the room was full of choking smoke and pungent manure. My sister and I snuggled at our mother's knees in a dark corner, while my father chatted with the men. Among these men was one who told the story of "The Wonderful Little Bird and the Most Beautiful Girl in the World." The men listened to him like children. I listened and fell asleep, but I will never forget the last few words of this storyteller: "There is no poorer country than ours." It was not until many years later that I understood the meaning of the last few words of this wonderful story...

    Two weeks ago, I and several fellow writers traveled from Tirana to my hometown of Elbasan to attend a literary evening. I took my five-year-old son along to visit his great-grandmother. More than thirty years ago, I made such a trip, on horseback, and it took more than three days to arrive, but when my son was born, trains had already been running in our beautiful country for three years. My son also likes to hear the story of "The Wonderful Little Bird and the Most Beautiful Girl in the World," but now no one will say that their country is the most unfortunate country in the world after telling the story. My son grew up with the new Albania. Today's Albania is already a socialist Albania, one of the happiest countries in the world.

    To talk about life in the new Albania, I must first tell you about our capital, Tirana. Ten years ago, there were only two cinemas in Tirana, a dilapidated library and museum, two middle schools, four or five primary schools, and two or three small factories. Today, it has a dozen middle schools, dozens of junior high schools and primary schools, six institutions of higher learning (Albania had no institutions of higher learning in the past), an Academy of Sciences, a drama theater, an opera and ballet theater, an open-air theater, a children's theater, four large museums, a national library, dozens of cinemas and clubs... Indeed, Tirana has expanded more than threefold in the past ten years, and it has become our country's largest industrial center. Here are the Stalin Textile Factory, the Hoxha Steel Plant, the "Guerrilla" Steel Plant, and building materials factories, shoe factories, tobacco factories, etc., employing thousands of workers. Among the workers in these factories, there are many women workers. The state has built comfortable dormitories with convenient water and electricity for the workers. Seventy percent of the workers in Tirana are shock brigade workers or Stakhanovite workers. They operate the most modern machines, which even workers in Lyon or Birmingham would have to envy. They have mastered the latest technologies and are using the most advanced Soviet working methods. Among them, there are rationalization proposers and innovators. Thanks to their intelligent efforts, they have saved the state millions of balangs, and some workers are already working not for the 1953 plan, but for the 1958 plan. …

    Let us take a train and a bus together on a trip from Tirana to Elbasan and then to Korçë. Ten years ago, Albania's main port, Durrës, was just a pile of ruins. The Nazis blew it up when they retreated, just as they blew up the bridges and culverts on Albania's highways. Today, Durrës is one of our country's most important industrial centers. Here, one can see not only ships from the relatively nearby Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries in Europe, but also machines, fabrics, and grains from faraway China that we need. These ships also bring the brotherly sympathy and support of our nine hundred million dearest friends across mountains and rivers. When they leave here with the pleasant feeling of coming again next time, they take away the respect and gratitude of our country's brave and hardworking people who are steadfastly creating a new life.

    But if these ships had come to our coast, to Durrës, ten years ago, people would have heard much more Italian spoken here than Albanian. In 1939, Fascist Italy mainly invaded our country through this port. At that time, there were only two or three primary schools here, but today secondary education has become compulsory. There is also a stadium, a professional theater named after Albania's great playwright Alexander Moisiu, and an excellent opera company. Albania's first shipyard after liberation was also built in Durrës, and the first train also departed from here to Tirana and Elbasan.

    Elbasan, in central Albania, is an ancient city with an oriental flavor. There are many mosques, many houses buried in thick-walled courtyards, and winding alleys. It is a typical city of feudal Albania. One of our country's great feudal chieftains, Akif Pasha, once held sway here and ruled everything. This person was the head of the Albanian puppet government established after the Italian fascists occupied our country. After liberation, his property was confiscated. The property of another great feudal chieftain not far from the city, Ibrahim Biçakçiu, was confiscated to build a huge oil refinery. Another new city, Çelik, has been established. It has become the center of the prefecture. This is one of the four or five new small cities that have been added to the map of Albania in the past ten years. The other four cities are the industrial and highway center of Rrogozhinë, the city of Stalin, the oil industry center of Patos, and the sugar industry center of Maliq.

    Maliq is a new type of small city, located near Korçë. It is located on a wide plateau 800 meters above sea level. Most of this plateau is a lake, or rather, a large swamp, covering an area of about ten thousand hectares. The feudal chieftains and wealthy bourgeoisie of Korçë used to occupy the land on the shores of the lake. They dreamed of drying up this swamp to expand their property and had even established a joint-stock company for this purpose. But they did nothing for many years. After liberation, however, in less than four years, our people reclaimed this large swamp and used it to plant sugar beets and wheat. Now a large-scale state-owned farm has been established here, surrounded by dozens of agricultural cooperatives. The latest machines cultivate these fertile lands, and most of the harvesting work is also done by machines. The yields of sugar beets and wheat increase every year. The village of Maliq, which used to have only twenty or so small houses, has now become a beautiful small city. A large sugar factory here produces sugar for the entire country of Albania. The city has a workers' club, which is one of the most beautiful workers' clubs in the country.

    Not far from here, Korçë was the most beautiful city in old Albania, and today it is even more beautiful. There is a professional theater and an opera company here, as well as Albania's first glass factory. There are more than fifty agricultural cooperatives nearby. Dozens of villages and cooperatives here have now been supplied with electricity. Some say that the cooperatives in the Korçë region have already been socialistized, and this statement is not an exaggeration. The rural cooperative undertakings here are a model for the whole country. They have long since eliminated illiteracy. Albanian peasants today can proudly turn their eyes to the cooperative peasants of the Korçë region. This used to be the area where guerrilla warfare was the most intense, and it was also the area where the invaders did the most damage; today, everything has been rebuilt, and it is even more beautiful. Light, joy, and happiness have come to every family. The shadows of feudal chieftains and bourgeois landlords no longer loom over the countryside.

    Dear Chinese comrades, profound changes have taken place in our country, and profound changes have also taken place in the lives of our people. This is because we have such great and powerful friends as the Soviet Union and China! (Attached picture)

    在新阿尔巴尼亚
    阿尔巴尼亚作家协会主席  德·舒特里基
    每当我在国内旅行的时候，往往会回想起三十多年前的一次旅行来。那时，我的父亲刚接到去我国南部的科尔察城中学担任教员的任命。我们从故乡爱尔巴桑前往。父亲雇了三匹马来搬我们的小家庭。我的妹妹和我两个人坐在放在马鞍上的两只木箱里。虽然有些挤，但是还舒适，尤其是很有趣。可是这次迁家花了三天时间，实在很累人。旅途中有两天我们是在山村小客店里宿夜的。我永远记得这些小客店：一间宽大的屋子，那是唯一的一间屋子，没有一扇窗，也没有天花板，房顶是几排乌黑的屋椽。屋子中间的地上烧着一堆大火，旅客们就围着火睡觉。马匹就在旁边休息嘶叫着，屋子里满是呛人的烟和刺鼻的粪臭。我和妹妹偎着妈妈的膝头睡在一个黑暗的角落里，父亲和那些男人们聊天。这些人中间有一个讲着“奇妙的小鸟和世界上最美丽的姑娘”的故事。那些男人们像孩子一样听着他讲。我听着听着就睡着了，可是我永远忘不了这个说故事的人最后几句话：“像我们这样穷的国家是再也没有了。”直到好几年以后，我才懂得这个美妙的故事的最后几句话的意义……
    两个星期以前，我和几个作家同志由地拉那到我的故乡爱尔巴桑去参加一个文艺晚会。我顺便带了我五岁的男孩一起去看望他的外曾祖母。三十多年前我也作过这样一次旅行，是骑马去，走了三天多才到达，可是我儿子出生的时候，火车已在我们美丽的祖国奔驰了三年了。我儿子也喜欢听人讲“奇妙的小鸟和世界上最美丽的姑娘”的故事，但现在再也不会有人在讲完故事后，说自己的祖国是世界上最不幸的国家了。我的儿子是和新的阿尔巴尼亚一道生长起来的。今天的阿尔巴尼亚已经是建设社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，是世界上最幸福的国家之一了。
    要谈谈新阿尔巴尼亚的生活，就得先向你谈一谈我们的首都地拉那。十年以前，在地拉那只有两家电影院，一个破破烂烂的图书馆兼博物馆，两所中学，四五所小学，两三家小工厂。今天，它有着十来所中学，几十所初级中学和小学，六所高等学校（过去阿尔巴尼亚是没有一所高等学校的），一所科学院，一座话剧院，一座歌舞剧院，一座露天剧场，一座儿童剧院，四个大博物馆，一个国立图书馆，几十家电影院和俱乐部……真是，十年来地拉那已扩展了三倍多，它已成为我国最大的工业中心了。在这里有斯大林纺织工厂，霍查钢铁厂，
  “游击队”钢铁厂，以及拥有几千个工人的建筑材料厂、皮鞋厂、烟草厂等等。这些工厂的工人中间，有不少是女工。国家为工人们建筑了水电方便的舒适的宿舍。百分之七十的地拉那工人是突击队工人或斯塔哈诺夫工作者。他们操作着最新式的机器，就是里昂或伯明翰的工人也不得不羡慕他们。他们掌握了最新的技术，运用着最先进的苏联的工作法。在他们中间，有的是合理化建议者，革新者。靠了他们的聪明的努力，他们替国家节约了几百万巴朗，有的工人已经不是为一九五三年的计划工作，而在为一九五八年的计划工作了。……
    让我们一起坐上火车和公共汽车作一次从地拉那到爱尔巴桑再到科尔察的旅行罢。十年以前，阿尔巴尼亚主要的港口都拉斯港，只是一堆断垣残壁。纳粹撤退时把它炸毁了，正如同他们炸毁阿尔巴尼亚各公路的桥梁涵洞一样。今天都拉斯已是我国最重要的工业中心之一了。这里不但有来自比较近的苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家的船只，而且还可以看到从遥远的中国运来的我们需要的机器、布匹和粮食。这些船只还带来了隔着千山万水的九亿最亲爱的朋友的兄弟般的同情和支持。当它们怀着下次再来的愉快心情离开这里的时候，又带去了坚定地创造着新生活的勇敢勤劳的我国人民的敬意和感激。
    但是如果这些船只十年前来到我们的海岸，来到都拉斯的话，人们在这里听到讲意大利话要比讲阿尔巴尼亚话多得多。一九三九年法西斯意大利主要就是通过这个港口侵略我国的。那时这里只有两三所小学，而今天接受中等教育已成为义务的了。这里还有一个体育场，一个以阿尔巴尼亚的伟大戏剧家亚历山大·摩伊西命名的职业剧院和一个优秀的歌剧团。解放后阿尔巴尼亚第一个造船厂也在都拉斯建造起来了，第一列火车也是由这里开出到地拉那和爱尔巴桑去的。
    我国中部的爱尔巴桑是个具有东方色彩的古城。这里有许多回教寺院，许多埋藏在厚墙深院里的房屋，弯弯曲曲的小巷。它是封建时代的阿尔巴尼亚的典型城市。我国的大封建头子之一阿訇倍·浮拉茨曾在这里作威作福统治过一切。此人即是意大利法西斯侵占我国后所建立的阿尔巴尼亚伪政府的魁首。解放以后，他的产业已被没收。离城不远的另一个大封建头子伊勃拉希姆·皮察古的产业则被没收来建造了一个巨大的石油炼油厂。另一个新的城市柴里克，已经建立起来了。它已成为本州的中心。这是阿尔巴尼亚地图上十年来新添上去的四五个新的小城市之一。其余四个城市就是工业和公路中心洛果奇那，斯大林城，石油业中心巴托斯，糖业中心马利克。
    马利克是个新型的小城市，就在科尔察附近。地处拔海八百公尺的宽广的高原上。这高原的大部分是个湖，正确些说，是一大片沼泽地，大概有万把公顷的面积。科尔察的封建头子和有钱有势的资产阶级过去占有着湖滨的土地。他们曾梦想把这片沼泽之地弄干来扩大他们的产业，并曾为此而设立了一个股份有限公司。但是他们许多年来什么也没有做。而解放以后，在四年不到的时间内，我国人民却把这一大片沼泽地治好了，并且用来种上了糖萝卜和小麦。现在这里已建立了一个大规模的国营农场，在它周围是数十个农业合作社。最新式的机器耕种着这些肥沃的土地，收割工作大部分也是用机器进行的。糖萝卜和小麦的产量每年都往上升。以前只有二十来个小屋子的马利克村，现在已经成为一个美丽的小城市了。一家大制糖厂在这里为阿尔巴尼亚全国生产着食糖。城里有一座工人俱乐部，是全国最漂亮的工人俱乐部之一。
    离此不远的科尔察，是旧时阿尔巴尼亚最美丽的一个城市，而今天它更为美丽了。这里有一座职业剧院和一个歌剧团以及阿尔巴尼亚的第一家玻璃厂。附近有五十多个农业合作社。这里的几十个村子和合作社今天已经得到了电力的供应。有人说科尔察区的合作社已经是社会主义化了，这种说法也不算得如何夸张。这里的农村合作事业是全国的模范。在扫除文盲方面，这里早就完成了。阿尔巴尼亚农民今天可以骄傲地把眼光转向科尔察区的合作社农民。这里过去是游击战最剧烈的地区，也是侵略者破坏最厉害的地区；今天一切已重建起来了，而且更为美丽了。光明、欢乐和幸福临到了每个家庭。封建头子和资产阶级大地主的黑影已经不再笼罩着农村了。
    亲爱的中国同志们，我们这个国家已经发生了深刻的变化，我国人民的生活也已经起了深刻的变化。这是因为我们有着像苏联和中国那样伟大和强大的朋友啊！（附图片）
