    Explaining National Grain Policy in Conjunction with Reality
    Tie Yi

    Using various articles and propaganda materials, combining them with the actual situation of the locality, closely linking them with the thinking of local cadres and the masses, and explaining the national policy to the broad masses of cadres and the masses in a popular and systematic way is an important method for newspapers to promote various tasks; it is also an important method for newspapers to promote the work of rectifying grain unified purchase and sales. At present, some newspapers are doing this when publicizing the policies for rectifying grain unified purchase and sales, and Guangxi Daily is one of the better ones.

    Since April, Guangxi Daily has continuously published editorials, short commentaries, essays, and propaganda materials, systematically explaining the great significance and specific content of the policies for rectifying grain unified purchase and sales, the issue of mobilizing the masses, the issue of improving the thinking of cadres, the issue of combining with spring plowing and production, and other aspects in a popular way. These explanations in Guangxi Daily are relatively closely linked to reality. This is not only reflected in the fact that the newspaper often pays attention to analyzing local situations, using vivid examples, and comparing the issues in the thinking of cadres and the masses to explain the important significance of the policy when explaining the policy, but also in the fact that the newspaper often pays attention to the new situations and new problems, deviations and errors in the actual work progress, to explain the policy in a timely and specific manner, in order to help cadres and the masses to have a better understanding of the policy and implement it correctly.

    The first method of Guangxi Daily in explaining the policy in conjunction with reality is to start with an analysis of the local situation and the current problems; in the explanation, it also combines the interpretation of the spirit of the policy with the work of dispelling the ideological concerns of the masses. A propaganda material published by the newspaper systematically explaining the policy to the peasants is a typical example in this regard. This propaganda material first analyzes the situation of the province's bumper harvest in the summer and autumn of last year for the peasants, and specifically and concisely calculates the three accounts of production, purchase, and sales in the province. The result of the calculation proves that Guangxi Province is indeed not short of grain. The grain purchased by the state from the province last year not only did not exceed the amount of surplus grain of the peasants, but also did not exceed the amount of grain increased in the province last year; on the other hand, the grain that the state has sold in the province has long been more than enough for the grain-deficient households in the province. After the newspaper calculated the accounts, it immediately raised the question that the peasants are eagerly concerned about: Since the whole province is not short of grain, why are people everywhere in the countryside shouting for grain shortage, and in fact there are still a very small number of grain-deficient households? The newspaper answered this question. It cited examples of shortcomings in grain unified purchase and sales work and examples of farmers who have surplus grain at home but still want to buy grain, indicating that the grain shortage is artificial, and the main reason is that the national grain unified purchase and sales policy has not been implemented well enough in the past, and the grain supply has not been reasonable enough. The newspaper pointed out that as long as the grain unified purchase and sales work is rectified and as long as a reasonable supply is achieved, the problem of grain supply for grain-deficient households can be completely guaranteed. In this way, the newspaper launched a systematic explanation of the content of the policy. The newspaper closely combined the various ideological concerns of the masses when explaining the various specific contents of the policy. For example, every time the newspaper cited a kind of ideological concern of the masses, it then specifically explained the relevant policies, indicating that as long as they earnestly abide by this policy, this concern is completely unnecessary. In this way, the newspaper analyzed the various ideological concerns of the masses, and also took the opportunity to explain and explain the specific content and spirit of the various policies.

    It is precisely because the newspaper clearly outlined a local life profile and cited examples familiar to the masses before explaining the policy; it is precisely because the newspaper combined and analyzed the ideological concerns of the masses in this regard in the explanation of the policy, that made this explanation have a relatively attractive power, the newspaper seems to be discussing their own problems with the peasants, so the newspaper's final request to the masses, to respond to the various calls of the policy with positive actions, is naturally more easily accepted by the masses. This shows that combining local actual conditions and the thinking of the masses to explain the policy can make policy propaganda lively and easy to be understood and accepted by the masses, and turn the policy into the practical force of the masses.

    The second method of Guangxi Daily in explaining the policy in conjunction with reality is to explain according to the needs of actual work development. That is, when the newspaper finds that the actual situation has developed, and some of its original explanations of the policy can no longer meet the current needs, or when the newspaper finds that some people do not understand a certain important aspect or a certain important link of the policy deeply enough and comprehensively enough, it will especially further explain this aspect or this link of the policy. For example, after the rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work was launched, the newspaper found that some staff members in some places only paid attention to the specific practices stipulated in the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, but ignored the ideological and political work that should be carried out among the masses, which was specially emphasized in the instructions. Therefore, these people only paid attention to investigating the situation and calculating the accounts in their work, but did not pay attention to explaining the policy to the masses. This not only cannot eliminate the tension of the masses, but will increase the suspicion of the masses. In response to this situation, the newspaper focused on explaining the issue of mobilizing the masses in an editorial. The editorial analyzed several concerns still existing in the thinking of the masses, and after pointing out the harm of abandoning ideological work to simply investigate the situation and calculate the accounts, it further explained the original text of the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the emphasis on mobilizing the masses. The newspaper cited the original text of the instructions to show that any view that only pays attention to the specific practices in the instructions, but ignores the ideological mobilization work of the masses, is a one-sided understanding of the central policy. The newspaper opposes using any reason as an excuse to underestimate the importance of ideological work, and further pointed out that not only in the difficult times of work, but even when the work seems to be very smooth, the ideological work of the masses should not be neglected. The advantage of this explanation method is that although the newspaper repeatedly talks about the clauses and articles of the policy, but each time it supplements new situations, and each time it is aimed at new problems, it makes people feel different and fresh every time they read it, and each time it makes people have a deeper understanding of the policy, which helps to fully implement the policy.

    The third method of Guangxi Daily in explaining the policy in conjunction with reality is to further explain the policy while fighting against errors that violate the policy, in order to help cadres in various places further distinguish the policy boundaries and specifically grasp and implement these policies. For example, the newspaper found that staff members in some areas violated the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. They did not use the method of compressing grain that should not be supplied to reduce the grain sales volume, but concentrated their main efforts to make the surplus grain farmers take out more surplus grain. Later, the newspaper found that some areas also mistakenly went to all those who had purchased more grain to ask for the grain back when implementing the compression of grain that should not be supplied. These all increased the confusion in the grain work. The newspaper then used two editorials to correct these errors and solve these problems. The newspaper did not simply criticize these errors in the editorial, but while criticizing these views and practices that violated the policy, while analyzing the nature and harm of these errors, it also actively expounded the relevant policies. The newspaper cited the relevant original text of the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in an editorial to show that the rectification of grain unified purchase and sales work, "first and foremost, is to compress the parts that should not be supplied, to ensure a reasonable supply, and to ensure that the national sales targets are not broken through." The newspaper used the work results of many areas to prove that this instruction of the Central Committee is completely correct, and it is wrong for some places not to do so. In another editorial, the newspaper cited a page of the original text of this instruction to prove that the so-called "compression of the parts that should not be supplied" should be to pay attention to reducing those unreasonable requirements when evaluating the new supply quantity, instead of going to all those who have bought more grain to ask for the grain back. The newspaper further pointed out that as for those who have falsely reported and bought more grain, except for those profiteers, rich peasants, and landlords who deliberately carry out speculation and sabotage and falsely report more purchases must be returned in full, for ordinary farmers, it is only those who "have bought more in the past and are now able to withdraw," to persuade them to voluntarily withdraw a part. After such elucidation and development by the newspaper, it not only makes it easier for those staff members who have made mistakes, but also makes it easier for staff members in other places to specifically grasp the policy.

    The propaganda of any economic policy in the newspaper is not only to achieve the economic goals directly stipulated by the policy, but also to achieve the political goals of improving the ideological style of cadres and raising the awareness of the masses. The above-mentioned propaganda of Guangxi Daily is not only to achieve the purpose of rectifying grain unified purchase and sales work, but also to help cadres improve their policy level and help the masses improve their political awareness.

    结合实际讲解国家粮食政策
    铁衣
    运用各种文章和宣传材料，结合当地实际情况，密切联系当地干部和群众思想，向广大干部和群众通俗地系统地讲解国家政策，是报纸宣传各项工作的一个重要方法；当然也是报纸宣传整顿粮食统销工作的一个重要方法。目前，有些报纸对整顿粮食统销工作政策的宣传，就是这样做的，而广西日报是其中做得较好的一个。
    从四月份起，广西日报就不断发表社论、短评、杂文和宣传材料，有系统地对整顿粮食统销工作政策的重大意义和具体内容，对发动群众的问题、对提高干部思想的问题、对结合春耕生产以及其他方面的问题等都作了通俗的讲解。广西日报的这些讲解是比较紧密结合实际的。这不仅表现在报纸在讲解政策时，经常注意用分析当地情况、用生动事例、用干部和群众思想上的问题来对比说明政策的重要意义，而且表现在报纸经常注意针对实际工作进展中的新情况和新问题、偏差和错误，来及时地具体交代政策，以帮助干部和群众对政策作更进一步的了解和正确地贯彻。
    广西日报结合实际讲解政策的第一种方法是先从分析当地情况、提出当前问题入手；在讲解中，它又使政策精神的阐释同消释群众思想顾虑的工作结合起来。报纸发表的一篇向农民系统讲解政策的宣传材料，在这方面是一个典型的例子。这个宣传材料，首先向农民分析了全省去年夏秋两季丰收的情况，具体而扼要地算了全省产、购、销三笔账。算账的结果证明广西省确是不缺粮的。国家去年向全省统购的粮食，不仅没有超出农民余粮的数额，而且没有超出全省去年增产粮食的数额；而另一方面，国家已经销售在全省的粮食，对全省缺粮户来说，早就绰绰有余了。报纸在算账以后，立即提出了农民迫切关心的问题：既然全省并不缺粮，为什么现在农村里还到处有人喊缺粮，而且实际上也还有极少一部分缺粮户呢？报纸回答了这个问题。它举出有关粮食统销工作缺点方面的例子和农民中家有余粮还要买粮的例子，说明粮食紧张状况是人为的，其主要原因是过去对国家粮食统销政策贯彻得不够好，粮食供应得不够合理。报纸指出，只要整顿好粮食统销工作，只要做到了合理供应，缺粮户的吃粮供应问题是完全可以得到保证的。报纸就这样展开了对政策内容的系统讲解。报纸在讲解政策的各项具体内容时，是密切结合群众的各种思想顾虑进行的。比如，报纸每举出群众的一种思想顾虑，便接着具体交代有关的政策，说明只要认真去遵守这个政策，这种顾虑是完全不必要的。就这样，报纸分析了群众的各种思想顾虑，也借以交代和讲解了各项政策的具体内容和精神。
    正是由于报纸在交代政策之前，清楚地勾划出了一个当地生活的轮廓，并举出了为群众所熟悉的例子；正是由于报纸在讲解政策中结合和分析了群众在这方面的思想顾虑，就使这种讲解具有比较引人的力量，报纸像是同农民在讨论他们自己的问题，因此报纸最后向群众发出的要求，要他们用积极行动响应政策的各项号召，自然也就比较容易被群众所接受。这说明结合当地实际情况和群众思想来讲解政策，就可以使政策宣传生动活泼，比较易于被群众理解接受，使政策变为群众的实践力量。
    广西日报结合实际讲解政策的第二种方法，是根据实际工作发展的需要去讲解。这就是当报纸发现实际情况发展了，自己原来对政策所作的讲解，有些已不能满足当前的需要的时候，或者当报纸发现有些人对政策的某个重要方面或某个重要环节还了解得不够深刻和不够全面的时候，它就特别再对政策的这一方面或这一环节作进一步的讲解。例如，当整顿粮食统销工作展开以后，报纸发现有些地方的工作人员，只注意国务院和中共中央指示中所规定的具体作法，却忽略了指示中所特别强调的应该对群众进行思想政治工作。因此，这些人在工作中只注意摸底算账，却不注意向群众交代政策。这不仅不能消除群众的紧张心理，反而会增加群众的疑惧。报纸便针对这种情况，在一篇社论里着重讲解了发动群众的问题。社论分析了群众思想上还存有的几种顾虑，在指出放弃思想工作去单纯地摸底算账的害处以后，又把国务院和中共中央指示中关于强调发动群众的那一段原文，做了进一步的讲解。报纸引证指示原文来说明：任何只注意指示中的具体作法，而忽略对群众的思想发动工作的看法，都是对中央政策的片面理解。报纸反对以任何理由作借口来低估思想工作的重要性，并进一步指出，不仅是在工作困难的时候，即使在工作看来十分顺利的时候，也不可忽视对群众的思想工作。这种讲解方法的好处，在于报纸虽然是在反复地多次地谈论政策的某些段落的条文，但由于每次都补充了新的情况，都针对着新的问题，就使人每次读来，都有不同的新鲜感觉，每次都使人对政策的理解更深入一步，这就有助于政策的全面贯彻。
    广西日报结合实际讲解政策的第三种方法，就是在同违犯政策的错误作斗争时，进一步讲解政策，以帮助各地干部进一步分清政策界限，具体掌握和贯彻这些政策。例如，报纸发现，有些地区的工作人员违犯了国务院和中共中央的指示，他们不是用压缩不应供应的粮食来使粮食销售量下降，而是集中主要力量去使余粮户农民再拿出余粮来。后来报纸又发现，还有些地区执行压缩不应供应的粮食时，错误地去向所有已经多购了粮食的人索回粮食。这些都增加了粮食工作上的混乱。报纸便先后在两篇社论里来纠正这些错误和解决这些问题。报纸在社论里并不只是对这些错误进行单纯的批评，而是在批评这些违犯政策的观点和作法的同时，在分析这些错误的性质和危害性的同时，又积极地阐述了有关政策。报纸在一篇社论里引证国务院和中共中央指示的有关原文，来说明整顿粮食统销工作，“首先是而且主要是压缩不应供应的部分，来保证合理的供应，保证国家销售指标不被突破。”报纸根据许多地区的工作结果，来证明中央这个指示是完全正确的，一些地方不这样做是错误的。在另一篇社论里报纸又引证了这个指示的一页原文，来证明所谓“压缩不应供应的部分”应是在评定新的供应数量时，注意减去那些不合理的要求，而不是去向所有已经多买了粮的人索回粮食来。报纸进一步指出至于对已经冒报多买了粮食的人，除了那些存心进行投机破坏而冒报多购的奸商、富农、地主等必须全部退回外，对于普通农民就只是对那些“过去多买了现在有条件退出的”，才去说服他们自愿退出一部分来。经过报纸这样的阐明和发挥，就不仅使那些犯了错误的工作人员，而且也使其他地方的工作人员，更便于具体掌握政策了。
    报纸对于任何一项经济政策的宣传，都不只是为了达到政策所直接规定的经济目的，而且要达到改进干部思想作风和提高群众觉悟程度的政治目的。广西日报的上述宣传，正是不仅可以达到整顿粮食统销工作的目的，而且也可以帮助干部提高政策水平，帮助群众提高政治觉悟。
