    Kailuan Coal Mine recently formulated a comprehensive conservation plan based on the waste phenomena exposed by employees. According to this plan, just in the item of pit timber consumption alone, more than one million yuan can be saved by the end of the year.

Therefore, the plan first stipulates the need to rectify labor organization, promote the mine production work team system, fix job quotas, reduce non-production personnel in various auxiliary units above and below ground, and at the same time rectify labor discipline, requiring an increase in attendance rate of more than two percent. Regarding the shortcomings of low mechanical utilization rate, the mine's leadership also plans to increase the utilization rate of combined coal mining machines and coal cutting machines by more than 50 percent in June compared with May, and reduce the ash content of coal by 0.77 percent from the national plan. The plan also stipulates many specific conservation measures. (Xinhua News Agency)

    开滦煤矿订出全面节约计划
    开滦煤矿最近根据职工们揭发出来的浪费现象，制定了一个全面的节约计划。按照这个计划，只是坑木消耗一项，到年底就可节约一百多万元。
    这个矿过去因为劳动组织不合理，制度不严密，今年第一季度缺勤就达二十万多个工。因此，计划中首先规定要整顿劳动组织，推行矿井生产工作队的制度，固定工种定员，缩减井上井下各辅助单位的非生产人员，同时整顿劳动纪律，要求提高出勤率百分之二以上。煤矿的领导方面，也针对机械利用率不高等缺点，计划在六月份把联合采煤机和截煤机的使用率比五月份提高百分之五十以上，煤的灰份要比国家计划降低百分之零点七七。计划中还规定了很多节约的具体措施。　（新华社）
