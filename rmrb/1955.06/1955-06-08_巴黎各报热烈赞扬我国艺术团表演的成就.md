Xinhua News Agency, July 7th -- According to Agence France-Presse on the 6th, all Parisian newspapers on the 6th emphasized the outstanding achievements of the Chinese Art Troupe's premiere performance at the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre on the 4th while participating in the International Drama Festival. The 5th was a Sunday, and the newspapers were not published. However, a day of reflection did not diminish the enthusiasm of the commentators.

According to Agence France-Presse, what impressed most critics was the dance artistry and martial arts skills of the Chinese Peking Opera. The Peking Opera programs performed included "San Cha Kou," "The Broken Bridge," "Havoc in Heaven," and "Mount Yandang."

Louis Aragon, in "l'Humanité," enthusiastically praised the accuracy of the martial arts performers' movements, the humor of the mimetic actions, and the vibrancy of the costumes. He said, "This is a great art: the subtlest movements are performed with astonishing skill."

Guy Leclerc, in "l'Humanité," said that such a significant event surprised traditional theater critics. He pointed out that "what aroused the greatest enthusiasm from the Parisian audience was the actors' martial arts skills."

Robert Kemp, in "Le Monde," said that it was "a dazzling scene... overwhelming... the achievements of Peking Opera are enormous... undoubtedly the beautiful, vivid, and magnificent performance of the Paris Drama Festival."

Max Favalelli, in "Parisien Libéré," added:
"The Chinese actors are such perfect mime artists that even the most subtle movements in their performances are understandable to us... The enthusiastic audience gave Peking Opera a warm welcome—as it should be."

Jean-Jacques Gautier, in "Le Figaro," also expressed the same enthusiasm in his article. He wrote: "The performance is not only original; it is rare and extraordinary."

Ghislaine de Diesbach, in "Libération," wrote that the martial arts performance of the Chinese actors also left a deep impression on him. He said that although the performance was fresh and dazzling, it was easy to appreciate and understand.

Gaston Jollivet, in "l'Aurore," said that although this art has its traditions and unique style, it expresses "humanity" and "a certain degree of flexibility in a rigorously stylized performance."

"Combat" published an article by Magnien, who was very pleased with the great success of the Chinese actors. "Paris has recognized the authenticity of this art that it knew nothing about until now."

"France-Soir," the newspaper with the largest circulation in France, said: "I have rarely seen such a scene of a standing, entranced audience applauding the Chinese actors at the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre." Critic Paul Gordeaux said, "From the first act, Peking Opera captured the audience's hearts—this is a performance that cannot be missed."

Agence France-Presse said: This is how the success of the Chinese Art Troupe is highly praised by all critics. This was a definite fact from the very beginning. The four performances held at the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre were all sold out.

    巴黎各报热烈赞扬我国艺术团表演的成就
    新华社七日讯　据法新社六日报道：所有的巴黎报纸六日都强调指出参加国际戏剧节的中国艺术团四日在萨拉·伯纳特剧院首次演出所取得的卓越的成就。五日是星期日，各报都没有出版。可是一天的沉思并没有冲淡评论员们的热情。
    据法新社说：使大多数评论家印象很深的主要是中国京剧的舞蹈艺术和武术绝技。这次演出的京剧节目有“三岔口”、“断桥”、“闹天宫”和“雁荡山”等。
    路易·阿尔加齐在“义勇军报”上热烈地称赞了武术表演者的动作的准确、摸拟动作的幽默感和服装的鲜艳。他说“这是一个伟大的艺术：最细微的动作都是以惊人的绝技表演出来的。”
    居伊·勒克莱克在“人道报”上说，这样一个重大事件使得传统戏剧批评家们大吃一惊。他指出“引起巴黎观众最大热情的是演员们的武术表演的绝技。”
    罗伯·肯在“世界报”上说，这是“一个令人眼花缭乱的情景……令人目不暇接……京剧的成就是巨大的……无疑地这是巴黎戏剧节中的优美的、生动的和雄壮的伟大表演。”
    马克斯·法瓦列利在“巴黎激进新闻”上又说：
  “中国的演员们是非常完美的哑剧表演者，以致他们表演中的极细致的动作都是我们所能理解的……热心的观众给京剧以热烈的欢迎——这是完全应该的。”
    让·雅盖·戈蒂埃在“费加罗报”发表文章，他也表现了同样的热情。他写道：“表演不仅是独出心裁的而已，它是罕见的而且是奇异的。”
    纪涅伯特在“解放报”发表文章说，中国演员的武术表演也给他留下深刻印象。他说，虽然表演是新鲜的和令人目眩神迷的，但是它是可以很容易体会和了解的。
    加斯顿·若利在“震旦报”说，虽然这种艺术有它的传统性和特有的风格，但是它表现了“有人情味”和“在一种有严格程式的表演中有一定程度的灵活。”
    “战斗报”刊载了马涅安的文章，他对中国演员们取得的巨大成功感到非常高兴。“巴黎承认了到现在为止它还一点不知道的这种艺术的真实性。”
    法国销数最大的报纸“法兰西晚报”说：“我很少见到像萨拉·伯纳特剧院中站起来、入了迷的观众向中国演员们鼓掌欢迎的情景。”批评家保罗·果尔多说，“从第一场开始，京剧就抓住了观众的心——这是不能不看的一场表演。”
    法新社说：这就是中国艺术团的成功备受一切批评家推崇的情形。这从一开始时就是一个肯定的事实。他们在萨拉·伯纳特剧院举行的四次演出的票都卖光了。
