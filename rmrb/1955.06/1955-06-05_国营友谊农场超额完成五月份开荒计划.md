The state-run Friendship Farm exceeded its May land reclamation plan, despite continuous overcast and rainy weather in the last four days of May, which forced most tractors to stop working. As of the end of the month, a total of 14,655 hectares of land had been reclaimed, completing 66.6 percent of the total land reclamation task. This creates favorable conditions for completing the total task of reclaiming more than 21,000 hectares of land before July 1st.

	Since the start of land reclamation on May 2nd, all employees of the farm have been engaged in intense labor competition. In the first half of May, the Seventh Production Team won the rotating red flag with excellent results, completing 185 percent of the land reclamation plan and reducing fuel consumption by 14.5 percent. After the mid-month evaluation, the farm's labor competition movement reached a new climax. Each production team more carefully studied the progress of land reclamation, promptly corrected shortcomings, and continuously improved work efficiency. Now, the Eleventh Production Team has surpassed the Seventh Production Team, which had won the rotating red flag, and has moved to the forefront of the labor competition. This production team has completed 85.7 percent of its total land reclamation task (the general farm's required target is 60 percent). (Our correspondent stationed in Fulitun)

    国营友谊农场超额完成五月份开荒计划
    尽管五月的最后四天连日阴雨，迫使大部拖拉机停车，国营友谊农场的拖拉机手和农具手们仍超额完成了五月份开荒计划，截至月底为止，计开荒一万四千六百五十五公顷，已完成全部开荒任务的百分之六十六点六。给“七一”前全部完成开荒两万一千余公顷的总任务创造了有利条件。
    自五月二日开荒开始后，全场职工就投入紧张的劳动竞赛中了。五月上半月，第七生产队以完成开荒计划百分之一百八十五，降低油料消耗百分之十四点五的优异成绩获得了流动红旗。经过月中评比后，全场劳动竞赛运动又走向新的高涨。各生产队都更加认真研究开荒进行中的情况，及时改正缺点，不断提高工作效率。现在，第十一生产队已越过获得流动红旗的第七生产队而走到劳动竞赛的最前列。这个生产队已完成本队全部开荒任务的百分之八十五点七（总场要求的指标为百分之六十）。　（本报驻福利屯记者）
