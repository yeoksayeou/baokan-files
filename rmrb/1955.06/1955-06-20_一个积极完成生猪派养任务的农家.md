    A Farming Family Actively Completes Pig Raising and Procurement Tasks
    Liang Minzhi
    In January of this year, when Gaoling Township, Ninth District of Changsha, implemented the pig raising and procurement system, poor peasant Hu Hairu proactively requested to be assigned the task of raising four fattened pigs. Hu Hairu's father, Hu Helin, was originally skilled at raising pigs. After accepting the task of raising and selling pigs to the state, the father and son became even more active in feeding the pigs. They always chopped the pig feed finely and cooked it thoroughly. The two pigs they fed in the first quarter grew to over 120 catties each by late March.
    After these two pigs were sold to the state, four piglets were raised in their pigsty again. Soon after, they used these four piglets to exchange for two more half-grown pigs, which have now grown to over 120 catties each. Some time ago, one of the pigs developed red spots on its body, and the father and son quickly invited a veterinarian to diagnose and treat it, and they also separated the two pigs for feeding. Because it was treated early, the sick pig has gradually recovered.
    When people praised his family's fattened pigs for growing well, Hu Helin happily replied, "Don't underestimate these few fattened pigs, they are also the capital for national construction! Since we have accepted the task of selling pigs to the state, we must find ways to feed the pigs well and not let the state's plan fall through." Raising pigs has also brought great benefits to Hu Hairu's family. His family has eight mu of paddy fields, as well as miscellaneous grain fields and vegetable gardens in front of and behind the house. The manure from the pigs solves a large part of the fertilizer needed for these fields. The clothing and pocket money for the family of ten are also subsidized by the money from selling pigs.
    Some people in the countryside feel that feed is scarce, but Hu Hairu's family does not lack feed. Hu Hairu's family has planted feed crops in front of and behind the house. Currently, there are potatoes that are about to be harvested in the mountain land behind his house, sweet potato vines that are growing vigorously, and various vegetables in the vegetable garden next to the house, all of which can be used to feed the pigs. Hu Hairu's family did not require the state to supply any feed and fattened four pigs. In the first quarter of this year, the farmers of Gaoling Township have already completed the state's pig raising and procurement plan, selling forty-three fattened pigs that meet the purchase standards to the state on time. Currently, everyone is actively raising the pigs for the second quarter's pig raising and procurement plan. Raising pigs is beneficial to both the country and the individual. Hu Hairu and his son decided that after the two pigs they are currently raising are sold, they will buy four more piglets, which are expected to be ready for slaughter by the end of September, and they can raise another four in the fourth quarter. The father and son expressed with confidence: We must over fulfill the state's pig raising and procurement plan.

    一个积极完成生猪派养任务的农家
    梁敏之
    今年一月，长沙九区高岭乡实行生猪派养派购时，贫农胡海如主动要求给他家派养四头肥猪的任务。胡海如的父亲胡合林本是个养猪能手。接受派养派购的任务以后，他们父子俩喂猪就更积极了。他们每次总是把猪食切得细细的，也煮得很烂。他们第一季度喂的两头猪，到三月下旬每头都长到一百二十多斤了。
    这两头猪卖给国家以后，他家猪栏里又喂起四头小猪。不久，又用这四头小猪换回了两头架子猪，现在每头又长到一百二十斤以上了。前些时有一头猪身上长了红斑点，父子俩连忙请了兽医来诊治，并把两头猪隔离开喂养，由于治得早，病猪已渐渐好起来了。
    当人们称赞他家的肥猪长得好时，胡合林就高兴地回答说：“别小看这几头肥猪，它们也是国家建设的本钱哩！我们接受了派购的任务，就得想办法把猪喂好，不能让国家计划落空。”喂猪也使胡海如家得到很大的收益。他家有八亩稻田，屋前屋后还有杂粮地和菜园。这些田地所需要的肥料，靠猪粪就解决了一大半。全家十口人的穿衣和零用钱，也靠卖猪的钱来补贴。
    农村中有些人感到饲料困难，可是胡海如家却不缺饲料。胡海如家屋前屋后都种有饲料作物。目前他家屋后的山地里有快要收的马铃薯，有正长得茂盛的甘薯藤，屋旁的菜园里还有各样蔬菜，都可以用来喂猪。胡海如家没要国家供应一点饲料，就喂肥了四头猪。今年第一季度，高岭乡的农民已经完成了国家派养派购的计划，把四十三头合乎收购标准的肥猪按时卖给了国家，目前大家正在积极喂养第二季度派养派购的猪。养猪是利国又利己的事，胡海如父子决定等现在喂养的两头猪卖出去后，再买进四头小猪，预计九月底可以出栏，第四季度还可再养四头。父子俩充满信心地表示：一定要超额完成国家派养派购的计划。
