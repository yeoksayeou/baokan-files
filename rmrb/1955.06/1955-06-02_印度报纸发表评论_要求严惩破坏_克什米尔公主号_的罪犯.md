Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 1st. "Statesman" columnist Viditi wrote on May 29th: After the publication of the summary of the Indonesian investigation committee's report, a wave of anger and disgust has once again been stirred up in India. He said that now, the responsibility for sabotaging the "Kashmir Princess" has been determined quite accurately, and the next obvious step is to resolve the litigation procedures so that those suspects can be brought to trial.

The article said that a Kuomintang member who reportedly fled from Hong Kong to Taiwan is an important link in a chain of evidence. This person must be brought in for further investigation.

The article said that the Indian people, and probably people elsewhere, are now watching the US government with anxious hearts to see if it intends to use its influence on Chiang Kai-shek. The person responsible for this terrible act of sabotage is not an ordinary criminal. He has caused considerable international animosity, and therefore he cannot be protected as a political refugee.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 1st. Indian newspapers continue to denounce the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in sabotaging the "Kashmir Princess" aircraft.

The Urdu "New Century Daily" published an editorial on May 31st saying: "With the publication of the Indonesian investigation committee's report, the despicable act of sabotaging the aircraft is being condemned by all sides. Everyone demands that the criminals be punished after a thorough trial, and that those who are responsible for this most vile political assassination case be exposed."

The "Tribune" editorial on May 30th said that such a large-scale premeditated murder case with vile political motives has shocked India and the rest of the civilized world. The editorial hoped that the Hong Kong government would be able to capture the criminals.

The "Assam Tribune" editorial on May 29th said that the incident of sabotaging the "Kashmir Princess" aircraft was "the most lawless crime in the history of international diplomacy. The grief felt over the loss of life in this incident becomes even deeper after people know that everything was done by saboteurs." The editorial pointed out that "the purpose of this conspiracy was to bomb Chinese leaders and sabotage the entire Bandung Conference."

The "National Herald" editorial on May 28th said: "The culprit is Chiang Kai-shek, and to avoid more tragic events in the future, he must be eliminated."

The editorial pointed out that Hong Kong is "a center for espionage and subversive activities against the People's China." People will be watching closely the results of the Hong Kong authorities' investigation and the actions to be taken.

The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" editorial on May 28th condemned the sabotage as a "political act." The editorial believes that the preventive measures taken by the Hong Kong authorities were insufficient, and advocated that "those who were actually responsible for placing the time bomb at the airport must be found, and for this purpose, a thorough investigation must be conducted in Hong Kong immediately."

The "Free Press Journal" editorial on May 28th pointed out that the report of the Indonesian investigation committee "is only the beginning of the work of clarifying this terrible tragedy." It called for an immediate and thorough investigation.

    要求严惩破坏“克什米尔公主号”的罪犯
    新华社新德里一日电　“政治家报”专栏作家维迪蒂五月二十九日写道：在印度尼西亚调查委员会的报告摘要发表以后，印度国内再度掀起了愤怒和嫌恶的浪潮。他说，现在，对于破坏“克什米尔公主号”的责任已经相当准确地确定了，下一个明显的步骤就是要解决诉讼程序问题，使那些嫌疑犯受审。
    文章说，据说由香港逃到台湾的一个国民党分子，是一连串证据中的一个重要一环。必须把这个人弄来进行进一步调查。
    文章说，印度人民，大概还有其他地方的人民，现在怀着焦急的心情注视着美国政府，看它是否打算对蒋介石使用它的影响力量。对这种可怕的破坏行动负责的人不是一个普通的罪犯。他引起了相当大的国际恶感，因此他不能够作为政治难民受到保护。
    新华社新德里一日电　印度报纸继续斥责蒋介石特务分子破坏“克什米尔公主号”飞机的罪行。
    乌尔都文“新世纪报”五月三十一日发表社论说：“随着印度尼西亚调查委员会的报告的发表，破坏飞机的卑鄙行为正受到各方面的谴责。大家都要求在进行彻底审讯之后，对罪犯们予以惩办，并揭露那些应对这种最肮脏的政治谋杀案负责的人们。”
      “论坛报”五月三十日的社论说，怀有卑鄙的政治目的的这样大规模蓄意谋杀案，使印度和文明世界的其他地方都感到震惊。社论希望香港政府能够捕获罪犯。
      “阿萨姆论坛报”五月二十九日的社论说，破坏“克什米尔公主号”飞机的事件是“国际外交史上最无法无天的罪行。人们在知道一切都是破坏分子干的以后，对这个事件中的生命损失感到的悲痛变得更为深切了。”社论指出“这个阴谋的目的是要炸死中国领袖，并破坏整个万隆会议”。
      “国民先驱报”五月二十八日的社论说：“罪魁祸首是蒋介石，要避免以后发生更多的悲惨的事件，就必须把他消灭。”
    社论指出，香港是“反对人民中国的间谍和颠覆活动的中心”。人们将注意地等待着香港当局调查的结果和将要采取的行动。
      “甘露市场报”五月二十八日的社论谴责这次破坏是“政治行动”。社论认为香港当局所采取的预防措施是不够的，并主张“必须找出那些实际负责在机场上安置定时炸弹的人，为了这个目的，必须在香港立即进行仔细的调查。”
      “自由新闻”五月二十八日的社论指出，印度尼西亚调查委员会的报告“仅仅是澄清这个可怕的悲剧的工作的开始”。它要求立即进行彻底的调查。
