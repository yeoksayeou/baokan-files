    To strengthen petroleum exploration and oilfield development in Qinghai, Sichuan, Jiuquan in Gansu and other regions, the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry has decided to abolish the Drilling Bureau and Geological Bureau located in Xi'an, and establish the Qinghai Exploration Bureau in Xining City and the Sichuan Exploration Bureau in Chengdu City to be responsible for petroleum geological survey, drilling and oilfield development in Qinghai and Sichuan; at the same time, it has been decided to transfer the Jiuquan Geological Team, originally under the leadership of the Geological Bureau, and the Jiuquan Drilling Office, originally under the leadership of the Drilling Bureau, to the leadership of the Yumen Mining Bureau, and to establish the Geological Office and Drilling Office of the Yumen Mining Bureau to strengthen the development of the Yumen Oil Mine and the exploration of new oilfields in the Jiuquan area. In addition, the Petroleum Administration Bureau has also established a Geological Survey Office in Xi'an to lead petroleum geological surveys in northern Shaanxi and other regions. At present, the Qinghai Exploration Bureau and the Sichuan Exploration Bureau have been established.
    The petroleum exploration workload in Jiuquan, Qinghai and Sichuan this year is very large. The drilling workload in the Jiuquan area this year will increase by 14.5 percent compared with 1954. The geological workload in the Qinghai area has increased by 152 percent compared with 1954, and preparations are now underway for the drilling work to begin next year. The drilling workload in the Sichuan area has also increased by 118 percent compared with 1954. This adjustment of exploration organizations by the Petroleum Administration Bureau will be conducive to the development of exploration work in these regions. (Li Huixin)

    青海等地石油探勘机构加强
    燃料工业部石油管理总局为了加强青海、四川和甘肃酒泉等地区的石油探勘和油田开发工作，决定撤销设立在西安的钻探局和地质局，在西宁市设立青海探勘局，在成都市设立四川探勘局，负责青海和四川两地的石油地质调查、钻探工作和油田开发工作；同时，决定将原地质局领导的酒泉地质大队和原钻探局领导的酒泉钻探处划归玉门矿务局领导，成立玉门矿务局地质处和钻井处，以加强玉门油矿的开发工作和酒泉地区新油田的探勘工作。另外，石油管理总局还在西安市设立地质调查处，领导陕北和其他地区的石油地质调查工作。现在，青海探勘局和四川探勘局已经成立。
    酒泉、青海、四川今年的石油探勘工作量都很大，酒泉地区今年的钻探工作量比一九五四年增加百分之十四点五。青海地区的地质工作量比一九五四年增加百分之一百五十二，现在并已着手准备明年开始的钻勘工作。四川地区的钻探工作量也比一九五四年增加百分之一百一十八。石油管理总局这次调整探勘机构，将有利于这些地区探勘工作的开展。（李惠新）
