Xinhua News Agency, 12th June: The Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China held the Fourth National Supervision Work Conference in April. The conference summarized the supervision work of 1954 and, based on the new situation, defined the basic tasks for future supervision work and the central tasks for 1955.

    A total of 129 people attended the conference, including heads of supervision departments (bureaus) of various provinces and cities, and supervision offices of various departments of the State Council.

    The conference heard a report by Liu Jingfan, Vice Minister of Supervision, on the supervision work of 1954; a report by Qian Ying, Minister of Supervision, on the tasks and specific work of supervision work in 1955; and a report by Vice Minister Wang Han on several issues regarding learning from the experience of supervision work on the China Changchun Railway.

    The conference earnestly discussed the aforementioned reports, affirmed the achievements of supervision work in 1954, and put forward many critical opinions on the shortcomings in supervision work. In 1954, supervision organs at all levels across the country made many achievements. In rural areas, in coordination with relevant business departments, they carried out many key inspections of unified purchase and sale, agricultural production, mutual aid and cooperation, flood prevention and drainage, and production and disaster relief. This played a certain role in implementing agricultural production increase policies, educating cadres, and improving rural work. At the same time, supervision organs at all levels also focused on inspecting the material supply work of more than 500 enterprises and institutions in the industrial, construction and other departments, inspected more than 23,000 grain depots and the warehousing and storage work of many commercial departments, as well as the financial management work of banks and other departments. After inspection, various units handled many stockpiled assets and grains about to be damaged, saved losses, strengthened management, and established and improved some systems.

    In 1954, the supervision organs of the national railway system also universally promoted the experience of supervision work on the China Changchun Railway, and piloted this experience in twenty-four enterprises and institutions in the heavy industry, First Ministry of Machine Building, Second Ministry of Machine Building, textile industry, fuel industry, construction, transportation, commerce, and grain systems. All units achieved good results, proving that it is very necessary to promote this experience in enterprise departments.

    In addition, the supervision organs have improved work efficiency in handling citizen complaints due to the clear division of labor with relevant departments and the improvement of working methods. Over the past year, people's supervision organs at all levels have also conducted serious and prudent handling of personnel who violated laws and neglected their duties, strengthened the education of organ staff, and maintained state discipline.

    The conference criticized the shortcomings in supervision work, such as bureaucracy, red tape, insufficient understanding of the situation, and weak ideological leadership; in addition, some supervisory personnel had an unclear understanding of the purpose of supervision work, and did not understand that the purpose of supervision work is to help the supervised departments correct shortcomings and avoid mistakes, so as to ensure the correct implementation of state laws and policies, and ensure the completion or over fulfillment of plans. As a result, more or less subjective, one-sided and formalistic tendencies were produced in the work. Some only pay attention to formal supervision, but not to actual results; some supervisory personnel lack vigilance against bad tendencies, and turn a blind eye; some have unhealthy thoughts, care about personal gains and losses, and dare not adhere to the principled struggle, and individual supervisory personnel condone and accommodate bad people and bad deeds, and even shield them. The conference pointed out that these are irresponsible and wrong behaviors towards the people's cause, and must be seriously criticized and corrected.

    The conference pointed out: According to the general task of the state during the transition period and the constitution of the state, the basic task of supervision organs at all levels in the future must be to supervise administrative organs at all levels, state-owned enterprises and their staff to correctly implement the resolutions and orders of the State Council, resolutely implement the state's laws and policies, effectively complete the state plan, carefully protect state property, and faithfully fulfill their duties, so as to consolidate state discipline, ensure the thorough realization of the general task of the state during the transition period, and ensure the smooth completion of the socialist construction and socialist transformation cause.

    The conference pointed out that, according to the basic tasks of supervision organs in the future, the central task of supervision organs at all levels in 1955 is to supervise and inspect the implementation of this year's national economic development plan, inspect the situation of tightening the establishment and streamlining the institutions of administrative organs at all levels, and supervise administrative organs and enterprise staff at all levels to abide by the state discipline stipulated in the constitution. The specific work in 1955 is: in supervising and inspecting the implementation of this year's national economic development plan, focusing on inspecting the more serious and prominent problems in industry, especially heavy industry and basic construction, as well as agriculture, transportation, commerce and other departments.

    The conference particularly pointed out that at present, in inspecting the tightening of establishments and streamlining of institutions, supervision organs at all levels must assist administrative organs and institutions at all levels to inspect the existing institutions and establishments from top to bottom. The inspection should achieve the purpose of streamlining institutions, rationally using talents, improving leadership, improving work, establishing and improving systems, overcoming bureaucracy, and improving work efficiency.

    In supervising the observance of state discipline stipulated in the constitution, supervision organs at all levels must safeguard the state's centralized and unified leadership, give play to the supervisory role of the broad masses of people over administrative organs and enterprise staff at all levels, protect the people's democratic rights, and oppose the suppression of criticism and retaliatory behavior.

    The conference believes that in order to effectively complete the main tasks in 1955, it is first necessary to universally learn from the experience of supervision work on the China Changchun Railway, so as to further improve the level of supervision work and more effectively play the role of supervision organs; secondly, it is necessary to adjust the organization of supervision organs and appropriately change the leadership relationship, so as to concentrate the use of strength and strengthen the supervision and inspection of economic construction; thirdly, it is necessary to vigorously train and train supervision work cadres, strengthen punishment work and the handling of citizen complaints.

    The conference finally emphasized that in order to continuously improve supervision work, supervision organs at all levels must continuously educate supervision work cadres, be vigilant at all times, and not become proud and complacent because of a little achievement in their work, nor lose confidence because of shortcomings or difficulties encountered in their work; they must be educated to be modest and prudent, diligently and conscientiously loyal to their duties, and bravely adhere to the truth and adhere to principles, and do a good job in supervision work.

    监察部召开第四次全国监察工作会议
    确定监察工作今后的基本任务
    新华社十二日讯　中华人民共和国监察部在四月间举行了第四次全国监察工作会议。会议总结了一九五四年的监察工作，并根据新的情况，确定了监察工作今后的基本任务和一九五五年的中心任务。
    参加会议的有各省、市监察厅（局）和国务院各部门监察室的负责人等共一百二十九人。
    会议听了监察部副部长刘景范所作的关于一九五四年监察工作的报告，监察部部长钱瑛所作的关于一九五五年监察工作的任务和具体工作的报告，副部长王翰所作的关于学习中长铁路监察工作经验的几个问题的报告。
    会议认真讨论了上述报告，肯定了一九五四年监察工作的成绩，并对监察工作中的缺点提出了许多批评的意见。全国各级监察机关一九五四年内作出了很多成绩。在农村曾协同有关业务部门，对统购统销、农业生产、互助合作、防汛排涝、生产救灾等项工作，进行了很多次重点检查，这对贯彻农业增产政策、教育干部、改进农村工作起了一定的作用。同时，各级监察机关还有重点地检查了工业、建筑等部门的五百多个企业单位的物资供应工作，检查了两万三千多个粮食仓库和许多商业部门的仓储保管工作，以及银行等部门的财务管理工作。各单位经过检查，处理了许多积压的资财和将要损坏的粮食，挽救了损失和加强了管理工作，建立和健全了一些制度。
    一九五四年内，全国铁路系统的监察机关还普遍推行了中长铁路监察工作的经验，并在重工业、第一机械工业、第二机械工业、纺织工业、燃料工业、建筑、交通、商业、粮食等系统的二十四个企业单位内试行了这一经验。各单位都收到了很好的成效，证明在企业部门中推行这一经验是十分必要的。
    另外，监察机关在处理公民控诉工作上由于同有关部门进行了明确的分工，改进了工作方法，使工作效率有了提高。一年来，各级人民监察机关还对违法失职人员进行了严肃慎重的处理，加强了对机关工作人员的教育和维护了国家纪律。
    会议批评了监察工作中存在的官僚主义、文牍主义作风和情况了解不够、思想领导不强的缺点；另外有些监察人员对监察工作的目的认识不清，不了解监察工作的目的就是为了帮助被监督部门纠正缺点，避免错误，以保证国家法令、政策的正确执行，保证计划的完成或超额完成，因而在工作中产生了或多或少的主观片面和形式主义倾向。有的只注意形式上的监督，不注意实际效果；有些监察人员对不良倾向缺乏警惕，熟视无睹，有的思想不健康，计较个人得失，不敢坚持原则的斗争，有个别监察人员对坏人坏事姑息迁就，甚至于包庇。会议指出，这些都是对人民事业不负责任的错误行为，必须严肃地批判纠正。
    会议指出：根据国家过渡时期的总任务，根据国家的宪法，今后各级监察机关的基本任务必须是监督各级行政机关、国营企业及其工作人员正确地执行国务院的决议和命令，坚决地贯彻国家的法令政策，切实地完成国家计划，认真地爱护国家财产，忠实地履行自己的职责，以巩固国家纪律，保证国家过渡时期总任务的彻底实现，保证社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利完成。
    会议指出，根据监察机关今后的基本任务，一九五五年各级监察机关的中心任务是监督和检查今年发展国民经济计划的执行情况，检查各级行政机关、事业机关紧缩编制精简机构的情况，并监督各级行政机关、企业工作人员遵守宪法规定的国家纪律。一九五五年的具体工作是：在监督和检查执行今年发展国民经济计划方面，着重检查工业，特别是重工业和基本建设，以及农业、交通运输、商业等部门中较为严重和突出的问题。
    会议特别指出，当前在检查紧缩编制精简机构方面，各级监察机关必须协助各级行政机关、事业机关，从上而下地检查现有机构和编制的情况。检查时要达到精简机构，合理使用人材，改善领导，改进工作，建立和健全制度，克服官僚主义，提高工作效率的目的。
    在监督遵守宪法规定的国家纪律方面，各级监察机关必须维护国家集中统一的领导，发挥广大人民群众对各级行政机关、企业工作人员的监督作用，保障人民民主权利，反对压制批评和打击报复的行为。
    会议认为，为了切实完成一九五五年的主要任务，首先必须普遍学习中长铁路监察工作经验，以进一步提高监察工作水平，更有效地发挥监察机关的作用；其次必须调整监察机关的组织，适当改变领导关系，以便集中使用力量，加强对经济建设的监督和检查；再次必须大力培养、训练监察工作干部，加强惩戒工作和公民控告的处理工作。
    会议最后强调指出，为了不断提高监察工作，各级监察机关必须不断地教育监察工作干部，要时刻警惕自己，不要因工作中获得一点成绩就滋长骄傲自满情绪，也不要因为工作中有了缺点或遇到困难就失掉信心；要教育他们谦虚谨慎、勤勤垦垦地忠于自己的职责，勇敢地坚持真理，坚持原则，做好监察工作。
