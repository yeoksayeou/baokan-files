In the upper reaches of the Jing River and Wei River in Gansu Province, and along the banks of the Zuli River, a tributary of the Yellow River, nearly 100,000 mu of water conservation forests have been created this spring. This year's water conservation forests are mostly being created in gullies, steep slopes, and small tributary areas where soil erosion is severe. In many places, farmers are concentrating on afforestation in a single gully or on a single mountain, and are interplanting pasture grasses in the gaps between the trees.

During this year's afforestation efforts, key agricultural producers' cooperatives and key demonstration areas for soil and water conservation work in the aforementioned regions have received assistance from local state agricultural and forestry leadership organizations. Cadres dispatched by local state agricultural and forestry organizations have surveyed suitable afforestation land before afforestation begins and have helped various cooperatives and demonstration areas formulate longer-term afforestation plans. Local state-owned nurseries have also supplied farmers with more than 10 million tree seedlings. (Xinhua News Agency)

    甘肃营造水源林近十万亩
    甘肃省泾河、渭河上游地区和黄河支流祖厉河等河流的两岸，今年春季已营造水源林近十万亩。今年营造的水源林多在水土流失严重的沟壑、陡坡和小型支流地区。许多地方农民在一条沟壑、一个山头进行集中造林，并在林间的空隙地混种了牧草。
    今年造林时，上述地区的重点农业生产合作社和水土保持工作的重点示范区都得到了当地国家农林领导机关的帮助。当地国家农林机关派出的干部在造林前对宜林地作过调查，并帮助各社和示范区制定了较长时期的造林规划。各地的国营苗圃还供应了农民一千万多株林苗。　（新华社）
