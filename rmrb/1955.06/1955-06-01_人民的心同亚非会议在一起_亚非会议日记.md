The People's Hearts Are With the Asian-African Conference
--Asian-African Conference Diary

(Continued from yesterday)
A Day Without Agreement

Friday, April 22nd

The first major event in Bandung today did not occur within the confines of the Asian-African Conference venue.

The "Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on the Question of Dual Nationality" was signed this morning at the official residence of the Governor of West Java.

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai signed on behalf of the People's Republic of China. Foreign Minister Sunarjo signed on behalf of the Republic of Indonesia.

The brief twenty-minute signing ceremony marked the resolution of a problem that had lingered between the two countries for decades. As Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai stated in his address: "This is another good example of how our Asian and African countries can resolve difficult issues in the spirit of friendly consultation."

Foreign Minister Sunarjo later told reporters: "Although this treaty was signed by individual countries and is unrelated to the Asian-African Conference, it is a good sign and has sparked a spirit of mutual trust among the countries participating in the Asian-African Conference."

Today began with such good news, but as people turned their attention to the Merdeka Building, they couldn't help but feel apprehensive.

The tense atmosphere could be seen from the increased number of reporters in the hallways. More than one person was predicting that the top news from today's meeting would be a debate between Zhou Enlai and Kotelawala.

However, the news received at noon was that Zhou Enlai had only made a brief statement today. He said that, as he had expressed in the plenary session, the Chinese delegation was not prepared to participate in discussions about ideology here, as this was not the purpose of the conference. He told everyone that he had already exchanged views with the Prime Minister of Ceylon outside the meeting. He pointed out that he disagreed with the Prime Minister of Ceylon's interpretation of so-called new colonialism. Then, he said that although this was the case, after studying the Prime Minister of Ceylon's speech, he still found some common ground in it, which was the Prime Minister of Ceylon's call for all countries with colonies and dependencies to grant them independence within ten years, and he supported this positive spirit.

Kotelawala also stated that his speech yesterday only expressed his own different views, and he had no intention of causing a debate, let alone leading the conference to failure.

The Prime Minister of Burma, U Nu, appealed to everyone at the beginning of the meeting:

"Our conference has already taken a positive step in the direction of promoting world peace, and we must not allow this effort to be undermined by differing views in the final stages."

However, the attempt to expand "differing views" to undermine the conference did not willingly give up.

The head of the Turkish delegation, Zoru, disagreed with not holding a discussion and immediately read out a pre-prepared "nine-nation proposal" demanding

"Condemnation of all forms of colonialism, including international doctrines based on force, infiltration, and subversion." The nine countries were: Turkey, Iraq, the Philippines, Pakistan, Lebanon, Iran, Libya, Sudan, and Liberia.

The representative of South Vietnam followed up by saying that for them, "communist infiltration" was the "greatest imperialism," so he supported the nine-nation proposal.

The ensuing debate was said to be quite heated. Representatives from India, Syria, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pakistan, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, and Japan all spoke. It was not until the Chairman ruled to establish a separate drafting group on the issue of colonialism to conduct specialized research that a consensus was reached.

Because today was Friday—the Muslim day of prayer—the morning session ended particularly early. At just 11:45, many representatives of the Muslim faith withdrew from Conference Room No. 2.

To welcome this historic conference, a magnificent mosque had been newly built opposite the alun-alun square. Today, the first grand prayer was to be held here. When the co-religionists from almost all parts of Asia and Africa arrived, Muslims from all over Bandung had been waiting for a long time.

Among these far-flung co-religionists were Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser, Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali...and also the Chinese delegation's Imam Da Puhsheng.

At exactly 12:00 noon, loud verses of scripture were transmitted through loudspeakers, and Muslims began to lower their heads, praying for the success of the Asian-African Conference and for world peace.

The afternoon's Heads of Delegation meeting moved on to the next item on the agenda: world peace and cooperation, without waiting for the results of the colonialism issue group. Many issues were listed on this agenda: the question of coexistence, the question of Aden and the Southern Yemen region, the question of weapons of mass destruction, the question of disarmament, and certain aspects of the United Nations.

It was later learned that more than ten countries expressed their opinions on the issue of peace and coexistence at the afternoon meeting, and six countries put forward their own proposals.

All the speakers unanimously emphasized that today humanity is threatened by hydrogen bomb warfare and that every effort must be made to maintain peace.

However, different voices emerged when discussing how to achieve peace and prevent war.

It is said that the longest speech this afternoon was given by Indian Prime Minister Nehru. He said that he advocated a policy of neutrality. He disagreed with the Turkish representative's defense of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Pakistani representative's defense of the Manila Treaty. He denounced the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as one of the most powerful protectors of colonialism. He said that Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia have not yet gained freedom because the North Atlantic Treaty Organization wants to establish bases there.

However, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Zoru said that if his country had not joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it would not exist now and would not have come to participate in today's conference. He said he didn't understand what "coexistence" really entailed.

Nehru was surprised why the word "coexistence" would cause such unease in some people's minds. Nehru supported the proposal put forward by Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, which included the five principles of coexistence and the spirit of the United Nations Charter.

During the discussion, representatives from most countries expressed their support for the Burmese proposal and the spirit of peaceful coexistence.

However, due to the existence of different opinions, the discussion did not yield results by the end of the afternoon meeting. The discussion of the "colonialism" group also remained without results.

This was the first day since the start of the Heads of Delegation meeting that no agreement had been reached.

However, the Cultural Committee and the Economic Committee had already concluded their work this morning and afternoon respectively. Representatives from twenty-nine countries had reached a consensus on economic and cultural cooperation.

What is still hindering the progress of the conference is that black hand that appeared at the beginning of the conference, stubbornly trying to shift the conference's focus from opposing colonialism to opposing communism, and trying to cloak aggressive military blocs in a guise of peace.

Will this attempt ultimately succeed?

There are only forty-eight hours left until the scheduled closing of the conference. Tomorrow's meeting must answer this question.

Tonight is a night when social activities reach their peak.

As soon as the meeting adjourned, the Chinese delegation held a banquet at the villa to entertain representatives from Indonesia, Ceylon, Pakistan, Thailand, the Philippines, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Syria.

At 9:30 PM, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia also held a banquet at the Homann Hotel to entertain delegations from various countries.

At 11:00 PM late at night, Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser also attended a dinner hosted by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.

For reporters, tonight was not lonely either. The Chinese delegation held a special cocktail party to entertain reporters, where people tasted Maotai and Shaoxing wine; at the same time, the Japanese delegation also held a film reception, introducing Japan's export industries and landscapes.

It is almost impossible to record all the banquets held in Bandung during the Asian-African Conference. However, this is a very important aspect of the Asian-African Conference. At various tea parties, cocktail parties, and banquets, understanding not only began or increased between people and between countries, but also agreements were reached and even contracts were signed. Bandung's contribution in this regard is worth thanking.

The night has passed halfway. The news sent out from here has already changed the dateline to "23rd," as if all the activities in Bandung today have ended. However, a message suddenly came from the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Deputy Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, and the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Katay Don Sasorith, just held friendly talks at the Indian delegation's villa. At the end of the talks, the two sides issued a joint statement saying that the two governments will "develop and coordinate the good-neighborly relations that exist and should exist between the two countries" within the scope of the five principles of peaceful coexistence.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai were also present during the talks.

No matter what misunderstandings, distortions, or even slanders "peaceful coexistence" may be subjected to, the application and influence of the five principles in international life are constantly expanding.

This good news from midnight makes people greet the dawn with hope. (To be continued)

    人民的心同亚非会议在一起
    ——亚非会议日记
    李慎之　张彦
    （续昨）
    没有协议的一天
    四月二十二日星期五
    今天万隆的第一件大事并不是发生在亚非会议的会场内。
    “中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国关于双重国籍问题的条约”今天早晨在西爪哇省长官邸签字。
    代表中华人民共和国签字的是周恩来外交部长。代表印度尼西亚共和国签字的是苏纳约外交部长。
    短短的二十分钟的签字仪式，标志着解决了几十年来两国间悬而未决的一个问题。正如周恩来外长在致词时所说：“这是我们亚洲和非洲各国之间以友好协商的精神解决繁难问题的又一个良好的事例。”
    苏纳约外交部长后来对记者发表谈话说：“虽然这个条约是个别国家签订的，跟亚非会议无关，但是它是一个良好的迹象，并且在亚非会议与会各国之间激发起了互相信任的精神。”
    今天是以这样的喜讯开始的，然而当人们转到红白旗大厦的时候，心里还是不能不怀着忧虑。
    紧张的空气可以从走廊上记者人数的增加看出来。不止一个人在预言：今天会上的第一条新闻一定是周恩来和科特拉瓦拉的论战。
    但是，中午所得到的消息是：周恩来今天只作了简短的发言。他说，像他在全体会议上所表示过的那样。中国代表团并不准备在这里参加关于意识形态的讨论，因为这不是会议的目的。他告诉大家，他已经在会外同锡兰总理交换过意见。他指出他不同意锡兰总理对于所谓新式殖民主义的解释，接着，他说，虽然如此，他在研究了锡兰总理的发言以后，仍然在里面找到了一点共同之处，那就是锡兰总理所说的要求一切拥有殖民地附属国的国家在十年之内给它们独立，他支持这个积极的精神。
    科特拉瓦拉也接着表示，他昨天的发言只不过表示他自己不同的见解，并没有意思引起一场争论，更没有意思把这个会议引向失败。
    缅甸总理吴努在会议开始时就向大家呼吁：
  “我们的会议已经沿着促进世界和平的方向迈进了积极的一步，不要让这种努力在最后阶段中被分歧的见解所摧残。”
    然而，那种想扩大“分歧的见解”来摧残会议的企图并没有因此就甘愿罢休。
    土耳其代表团团长佐鲁不同意不展开讨论，并且随即宣读了事先拟就的一个“九国提案”，要求
  “谴责一切形式的殖民主义，包括凭借武力、渗透和颠覆活动的国际学说”。这九国是：土耳其，伊拉克，菲律宾，巴基斯坦，黎巴嫩，伊朗，利比亚，苏丹和利比里亚。
    跟上来附和的南越代表还说，对他们来说，“共产主义的渗透”才是“最大的帝国主义”，因此他支持九国提案。
    接着发生的争论据说是相当激烈的。印度，叙利亚，越南民主共和国，巴基斯坦，黎巴嫩，伊拉克，伊朗和日本等国的代表都发了言。直到主席裁决单独成立一个关于殖民主义问题的起草小组来专门进行研究为止，并没有得出一致的结论。
    因为今天是星期五——回教的祷告日，上午的会散得特别早。才十一点三刻，许多信仰回教的代表们就从第二号会议室里退出来了。
    为了迎接这个历史性的会议，特别在亚伦亚伦广场对面新建了一座堂皇的清真教堂。今天要在这里举行第一次盛大的祷告。当几乎从整个亚洲和非洲各地来的教友们到达时，从万隆全城来的穆斯林们已经迎候多时了。
    在这批远来的教友中，有埃及总理纳赛尔，巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里………也有中国代表团的达浦生阿訇。
    十二点正，扩音器里传出了宏亮的经词，穆斯林们开始低下头去，他们为亚非会议的成功祈祷，为世界和平祈祷。
    下午的团长会议没有等殖民主义问题小组的结果就进入了下一项议程：世界和平和合作问题。列在这项议程上的有许多问题：共处问题、亚丁和也门南部地区问题、大规模毁灭性武器问题、裁减军备问题，以及关于联合国的某些方面的问题。
    后来知道，在下午的会议上有十个以上的国家就和平与共处问题发表了意见，有六个国家提出了自己的提案。
    所有的发言者都一致强调，今天人类正遭到氢弹战争的威胁，必须尽一切努力来保持和平。
    但是，在讨论到应该如何实现和平和制止战争的时候，却又出现了不同的声音。
    据说，今天下午发言最长的是印度总理尼赫鲁。他说他主张中立的政策。他不同意土耳其代表为北大西洋公约和巴基斯坦代表为马尼拉条约所作的辩护。他斥责北大西洋公约是殖民主义的最有力的保护者之一。他说，阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯之所以至今还未获得自由，就是因为北大西洋公约要在那里建立基地。
    然而，土耳其的副总理佐鲁却说，他的国家如果没有参加北大西洋公约，就不会存在到现在，而且不会来参加今天的这个会议。他说，他不懂“共处”究竟包含些什么内容。
    尼赫鲁感到惊奇，为什么“共处”这个字在某些人心中会引起这样的不安？尼赫鲁支持缅甸总理吴努所提出的包含共处的五项原则和联合国宪章的精神的提案。
    在讨论中，大多数国家的代表表示了支持缅甸提案和和平共处的精神。
    但是，由于存在着不同的意见，到下午会议结束时，讨论并没有得到结果。“殖民主义”小组的讨论也仍然没有结果。
    这是代表团团长会议开始以来第一个没有达成任何协议的日子。
    不过，今天上午和下午，文化委员会和经济委员会已经先后结束了工作。二十九国的代表已经在经济和文化合作方面取得了一致的意见。
    阻挠会议进展的仍然是在会议一开始就出现了的那只黑手，它顽固地想把会议的锋芒从反对殖民主义转向反对共产主义，想给侵略性的军事集团披上和平的外衣。
    这种企图是否会在最后得逞呢？
    离预定会议闭幕的时间不过四十八小时了。明天的会议必须回答这个问题。
    今晚，是交际活动达到高峰的一晚。
    会刚一散，中国代表团就在别墅举行宴会招待印度尼西亚、锡兰、巴基斯坦、泰国、菲律宾、阿富汗、尼泊尔、叙利亚各国的代表们。
    九点三十分，沙特阿拉伯的王太子也在豪曼饭店举行宴会招待各国代表团。
    深夜十一点，埃及总理纳赛尔又出席了中国总理周恩来的晚宴。
    对于记者们，今夜也不寂寞，中国代表团举行了专门招待记者的酒会，人们在这里尝到了茅台和花雕；同时，日本代表团也举行了电影招待会，介绍了日本的出口工业和山川风物。
    要记录下亚非会议期间在万隆举行的一切宴会，几乎是不可能的，然而，这却是亚非会议十分重要的一面。在各种各样的茶会，酒会和宴会上，人与人间，国家与国家间不但是开始了或者增进了了解，而且达成了协议以至签订了合同。万隆在这方面的贡献是值得感谢的。
    夜已过半，从这里发出去的新闻已经换上了“二十三日”的电头，似乎万隆今天的一切活动都已经结束了。但是，忽然从越南民主共和国代表团那里传来了一个消息。越南民主共和国的范文同副总理和老挝王国的克特·萨索里斯首相刚才在印度代表团的别墅里举行了友好的会谈。在会谈结束的时候，双方发表了一个联合声明说：两国政府将在和平共处的五项原则的范围内“发展和协调在这两个国家之间存在着和应当存在的睦邻关系”。
    会谈时，印度总理尼赫鲁和中国总理周恩来也在场。
    不论“和平共处”受到什么样的误解、歪曲以至诽谤，五项原则在国际生活中的应用和影响却总是不断在扩大。
    这个从子夜来的喜讯使人们怀着希望去迎接黎明。　（待续）
