Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 31st: V.K. Krishna Menon, the Chief Representative of India to the United Nations, held a press conference in New Delhi on the 30th after recently returning to New Delhi from a visit to Beijing.

Menon said that the Chinese government's release of four U.S. Air Force personnel who intruded into Chinese airspace for provocative activities was a "major step" leading to the relaxation of tensions in the Far East. He said, "In my opinion, this opens the door. We will very likely see the issue of national restrictions on the other side resolved."

Menon said that one of the two or three factors causing difficulties was the lack of contact between China and the United States. "I have reason to believe that if more Americans with a spirit of exploration personally went to China to see, it would help promote reconciliation."

Menon said that Premier Zhou Enlai has publicly announced his attitude towards negotiations with the United States. Prime Minister Nehru has said that the other side is aware of this desire for negotiations. And now this desire has further developed and has been publicly announced in the report submitted by this Chinese leader to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. He said that China's willingness to negotiate with the United States is a "beneficial factor" for direct talks between the United States and China.

Menon said that negotiations must be conducted on the international stage between the two parties – the United States and the Chinese government. If the two parties are the Chinese government and Chiang Kai-shek, that is debatable. He also said that the Chinese government considers this to be "internal affairs," and they do not object to negotiating as "internal affairs." But negotiations must develop "at its own pace." China has never said, "We should not talk to anyone. This is an internal matter, and they are prepared to talk to them."

Menon stated that he will arrive in London on June 3rd and will meet with British Prime Minister Eden. After this, he will also visit the United States to participate in meetings of United Nations organizations. He will very likely meet with U.S. government officials.

    梅农访问我国回印度后举行记者招待会
    新华社新德里三十一日电　最近访问北京后返回新德里的印度驻联合国首席代表维·克·克里希纳·梅农三十日在新德里举行了记者招待会。
    梅农说，中国政府释放四名侵入中国领空进行挑衅活动的美国空军人员是导致缓和远东紧张局势的“重大步骤”。他说，“在我看来，这使得大门敞开了。我们将十分有可能见到对另一方面的国家限制的问题能得到解决。”
    梅农说，造成困难的两三个因素之一就是中国和美国之间缺乏接触。“我有理由相信，如果有更多的具有探索精神的美国人亲自到中国去看看，那将会有助于促成和解。”
    梅农说，周恩来总理已公开宣布了他对于同美国谈判的态度。尼赫鲁总理说过，另一方是知道这种谈判的愿望的。而现在这种愿望已有了进一步的发展，并且在这位中国领袖向本国全国人民代表大会常务委员会提出的报告中公开宣布了。他说，中国愿意同美国谈判是美国和中国直接会谈的“有益的因素”。
    梅农说，谈判必须在双方——美国和中国政府——之间在国际的范围内进行。如果说双方是中国政府和蒋介石，那是可以辩论的。他又说，中国政府认为这是“内政”，他们并不反对作为“内政”来谈判。但是谈判必须“以它自己的步调”发展。中国从未说过“我们不应同任何人谈。这是内政问题，他们准备同他们谈”。
    梅农表示，他将在六月三日到达伦敦并将同英国首相艾登会面。在这以后，他还将访问美国，参加联合国机构的会议。他很可能将同美国政府人士会面。
