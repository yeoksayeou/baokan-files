    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Hold Wholesale Commodity Exhibition
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas of Jiangsu Province have held wholesale commodity exhibitions, expanding wholesale business and invigorating rural markets. According to statistics from only nineteen counties including Yancheng, Hai'an, and Danyang, sixty-nine grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have held wholesale commodity exhibitions. According to statistics from thirty-four of these grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, the wholesale volume at the commodity exhibitions reached more than 200,000 yuan. On the day of the exhibition, the transaction volume of the Fangxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Danyang County increased more than thirteen times compared with the average daily wholesale volume in the past. In Longgang District, Yancheng County, three private merchants who previously thought that the supply and marketing cooperatives offered very few varieties for wholesale, and had never purchased goods from the supply and marketing cooperatives, purchased a lot of goods after seeing the exhibition. Zhou Jifu, a private merchant in Libao District, Hai'an County, originally planned to purchase only 50 yuan of goods from the supply and marketing cooperative, but purchased 138 yuan of goods after seeing the exhibition. Through the exhibition, the supply and marketing cooperatives further understood the needs of the market and increased the supply of goods. The Motou Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Rugao County expanded its wholesale varieties of general merchandise from fifty to one hundred and five.

    供销社举办批发商品展览会
    江苏省不少地区的供销合作社举办批发商品展览会，扩大了批发业务，活跃了农村市场。仅据盐城、海安、丹阳等十九个县的统计，已有六十九个基层供销合作社举办了批发商品展览会。据其中的三十四个基层供销合作社的统计，在批发商品展览会上，批发额达二十多万元。丹阳县访仙供销合作社在展览会的当天，成交额较过去平均每天批发额增加了十三倍以上。盐城县龙冈区有三户私商过去以为供销合作社批发的品种很少，一次也未向供销合作社进过货，看了展览会后，他们都购买了许多货物。海安县李堡区私商周吉甫原计划只向供销合作社进货五十元，看了展览会后，即进了一百三十八元的货。通过展览会，供销合作社进一步了解了市场的需要，增加了货源。如皋县磨头供销合作社由原百货批发品种五十种扩大到一百零五种。
