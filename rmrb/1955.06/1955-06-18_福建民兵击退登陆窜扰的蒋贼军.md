Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 17th. The militia of Zhangpu County, Fujian Province, repulsed a group of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who attempted an armed landing.

Before dawn on the 14th, more than ten Chiang Kai-shek bandits, aboard a wooden boat and under the cover of gunboats, sneaked into the sea area near Zhengwei in Zhangpu County, and then landed on the beach at Shangcai Bay, northeast of Zhengwei. Our militia immediately discovered them and resolutely resisted. After a brief battle, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled in disarray. We killed one Chiang Kai-shek bandit and seized one revolver, four U.S.-made grenades, and some other military supplies.
