    Oppose False Self-Criticism
    Mou Lan
    In January of this year, the Tangshan Steel Plant's converter workshop failed to meet its steel ingot production plan. The deputy director in charge of production convened a meeting, and with the approval of the plant director, decided to extend the time limit for delivering steel ingots to the warehouse as stipulated by the higher authorities, and to use scrap steel ingots to replace qualified products, in order to deceive the state and fraudulently obtain the honor of "completing the plan."
    This practice is, of course, completely wrong. Therefore, on March 13, the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily published an article criticizing this matter. Logically, the leading staff of the Tangshan Steel Plant should have learned a lesson from this and improved their work. In fact, they also made a public "self-criticism" in the newspaper in the name of "Tangshan Steel Plant," stating that they would "conduct a serious education on the national policy for all relevant personnel in the plant." Although this self-criticism was not profound, no one would doubt that some leading personnel in this plant would use the collective name of the steel plant to deceive the People's Daily and the vast number of readers. At the very least, their leadership positions were still worthy of trust.
    However, who could have imagined that they would engage in falsehood again on the issue of criticism and self-criticism? In March, when repairing the round kiln roof in the refractory workshop, they again used 4,338 kilograms of refractory bricks that had been confirmed as waste products and 46,366 kilograms of untested refractory bricks as qualified products; in order to complete the March production plan, they deliberately falsified and put 9,668 kilograms of untested refractory bricks into the warehouse as qualified products.
    Falsely reporting achievements, making false self-criticisms, and consciously engaging in deception have nothing in common with the qualities that leading personnel of socialist enterprises should possess. Leading staff in socialist enterprises should not only do their duty to complete the national plan, but also have the responsibility to continuously improve management and technical levels and strive to overfulfill the national plan. When there are shortcomings, we should realistically investigate the reasons, find out the lessons, and seek solutions for correction; there is no other shortcut. Judging from the behavior of certain leading staff in the Tangshan Steel Plant, it should be said that they do not understand what socialist business ideology and methods are, nor do they understand the importance of criticism and self-criticism; all they think about is the reputation of the plant and individuals. All enterprises should learn a lesson from this incident, and it is hoped that those who made false self-criticisms in the Tangshan Steel Plant will turn around and take the right path, and no longer move towards the cliff!

    反对虚假的检讨
    牟澜
    今年一月，唐山钢厂转炉车间未完成钢锭生产计划。管生产的副厂长召开会议讨论，经厂长批准，决定把上级规定的钢锭交库时间延长，并用废钢锭代替合格品，以此蒙骗国家，骗取“完成计划”的荣誉。
    这种做法当然是完全错误的。因此，三月十三日人民日报“读者来信专页”上，发表了文章，对此事进行了批评。照理，唐山钢厂的领导工作人员应该从中吸取教训，改进工作的。事实上，他们也用“唐山钢厂”的名义在报上作了公开的“检讨”，表示将“对厂内有关人员，普遍进行一次严肃对待国家政策的教育。”虽说这个检讨不深刻，也绝不会有人怀疑这个厂里的某些领导人员会用钢厂的集体名义欺骗人民日报，欺骗广大读者。至少，他们所处的领导岗位还值得信任的。
    但是，谁能想到他们却又在批评和自我批评这个问题上弄虚作假呢？三月份，耐火车间修圆窑窑顶时，又将已证实为废品的耐火砖四千三百三十八公斤、未经检验的耐火砖四万六千三百六十六公斤当作合格品使用；为了完成三月份生产计划，故意作假，把未经检验的耐火砖九千六百六十八公斤当作合格品入库了。
    虚报成绩、作假检讨、有意识地进行欺骗，这和社会主义企业的领导人员应有的品质是没有丝毫共同之处的。社会主义企业中的领导工作人员，不但要为完成国家计划尽职，而且有责任不断提高管理水平、技术水平、争取超额完成国家计划。有了缺点，应实事求是地查明原因，找出教训，寻求改正的办法，另外的捷路是没有的。从唐山钢厂某些领导工作人员的行为来看，应该说他们不了解什么叫社会主义经营思想和方法，也不了解批评和自我批评的重要性，所想到的只是本厂和个人的名誉。一切企业都应从这件事吸取教训，也希望唐山钢厂作假检讨的人回过头来走正道，再不要向悬崖的方向前进了！
