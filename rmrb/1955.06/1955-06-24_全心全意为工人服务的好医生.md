    A Good Doctor Who Serves the Workers Wholeheartedly
    Feng Yudong
    In the health station of the Iron Smelting Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, there is a good doctor. As soon as you mention him, everyone praises him as truly selfless and dedicated. This person is the model medical worker Gao Hua. Gao Hua has many exemplary deeds. During this year's model selection, many people questioned why the things he proposed were not written in the materials. The members of the model selection committee had to explain: "Our writing materials have limited space, how can we write down so many things!" Checking the original records, Gao Hua made as many as 1,347 off-duty house calls in 1954 alone; and off-duty medical treatment is not part of his job!

    Outpatient Visits Over Long Distances
    Zhang Keliang, a worker operating the hoist on the No. 2 blast furnace, lives in Nanzhai Village, more than twenty miles away from the factory. There are only three people in his family. His child has measles, and his wife is also sick. How can he go to work? But thinking that the factory is in the midst of a competition and there are few people on the hoist, Zhang Keliang still dragged his tired body to work, but he felt uneasy.
    At this time, Gao Hua had only recently been transferred to the Iron Smelting Department. When he heard about Zhang Keliang's difficult situation, he took the initiative to find him. Zhang Keliang said embarrassedly: "It's more than twenty miles away from the factory, how can I ask a doctor to come? You are also working now. After work, who doesn't want to rest?" Gao Hua firmly replied: "Don't say twenty miles, even forty miles, I can go to treat the illness." After work, they went to Nanzhai Village together to treat Zhang Keliang's wife and children.
    Chen Qiang, a material warehouse worker who lives in Zhangzitou in the East Mountain, has a child who is seriously ill. It's more than ten miles away from the factory, and the road is very difficult to walk. Chen Qiang also works the night shift and doesn't get off work until twelve o'clock at night. He asked Gao Hua to see the child early the next morning; or he would ask for leave and walk with Gao Hua at six o'clock after he got off work. Gao Hua said: "If the child is very sick, going tomorrow may be too late; if you ask for leave to go, it will affect production. Let's go together after you get off work!"
    At twelve o'clock at night, they set off from the factory. It had just snowed, and they were walking on a mountain road. Gao Hua was not familiar with the road and slipped several times on the way. He fell, got up and continued to move forward without any complaints. Chen Qiang said very gratefully: "It's really too hard for you!" Gao Hua replied calmly: "The child's life is important. What does it matter if a doctor falls a few times!"
    When they arrived at Chen Qiang's house, it was already two o'clock in the morning. Gao Hua immediately diagnosed and treated the child and told Chen Qiang the treatment methods. The child's condition improved significantly. Chen Qiang repeatedly asked him to stay overnight, but he insisted on going home, saying: "Think about how many workers are waiting for me to see a doctor tomorrow, how can I not rush back to work?"
    On the way back, the cold wind was biting. Although Gao Hua felt the severe cold of the winter night and felt very tired, he was very excited in his heart. He thought: "Another little life has been saved by my own hands. This is truly a doctor's joy."

      Yan Shiduo's Transformation
      Yan Shiduo, a mud worker in the No. 1 blast furnace, was originally a backward worker. He had some back pain, and he could have gone to work; but in order to move his house, he pretended that his condition had worsened and sent a note to the factory asking for two days off to rest.
    Gao Hua checks the attendance of employees every day. This day, seeing that Yan Shiduo had asked for sick leave, he thought that his back pain was really serious. So he agreed with his foreman to go to see him after work.
    At seven o'clock in the afternoon, they arrived at Yan Shiduo's house. As soon as they entered the door, the room was empty and there was nothing left. After inquiring from the neighbors, they went to Yan Shiduo's new home. At this time, Yan Shiduo was tidying up his housework. When he saw the doctor and the foreman, he was ashamed and speechless. Gao Hua strictly criticized him for his dishonest behavior, but still checked his back pain. Yan Shiduo was ashamed and moved. After returning to the Iron Smelting Department, he wrote a review and made a guarantee. Since then, he has never been absent from work, and he arrives early and leaves late every day, working hard in production, transforming from a backward worker into an activist.

      Amiable and Affectionate
    In the workshop, workers don't call Gao Hua "Doctor Gao," they affectionately call him "Old Gao." They can tell him their conditions thoroughly and in detail. Gao Hua never knows fatigue when seeing patients, and he is never impatient. He asks carefully and examines patiently. The workers are unrestrained with him, like their own relatives, and can fully disclose their conditions. This allows him to find out the source of the disease, prescribe the right medicine, and easily cure the disease. Therefore, although Gao Hua is not particularly outstanding in medicine and drug therapy, he sees more patients than others, and he cures more patients than others.

    Improving Environmental Sanitation and Preventing Diseases
    Gao Hua not only actively serves the injured and sick, but also puts more effort into preventing diseases.
    The iron smelting department, as a smelting and production department, has a lot of dust, smoke, and complex raw materials, making it difficult to improve environmental sanitation. However, Gao Hua knows that as long as the masses are mobilized, no difficulties cannot be overcome. He suggested that the leaders of the Iron Smelting Department establish a sanitation system, with a major cleaning every Wednesday. When the time comes, Gao Hua always goes to the workshop to sweep in person. When the workers see the doctor picking up a broom, who can stand by and watch? In this way, in 1954 alone, the Iron Smelting Department was liberated from the dirty and chaotic accumulation of dust and became a clean workshop.
    The mineral powder in the bottom of the material section warehouse in the raw material work section flies around, seriously affecting the health of workers. Gao Hua, along with repair workers Zheng Hua, Fu Yongqing, and others, discussed and mobilized the workers to use waste materials to install a water pipe in their spare time, and regularly spray water, which largely solved the dust problem.
    Gao Hua also attaches great importance to health propaganda work. Gao Hua's voice is often heard on the workshop broadcasts, materials written by Gao Hua are often seen on the blackboards, and Gao Hua is often seen explaining health knowledge to the workers during rest periods. He often says: "Disease prevention is more important than treatment, and health care is more important than diagnosis and treatment."
    One winter night, he had already gone to bed to rest when he suddenly heard the news that a cold wave was coming. He knew that the blast furnace workers were not prepared, and even if they heard the cold wave news, they often didn't pay attention, so he immediately ran to the factory and told the night shift workers to put on their clothes. The workers said with emotion: "With a good doctor like Gao Hua caring about us, how can we not care about production!"

    Eliminating Historical Occupational Diseases
    Iron smelting workers often have personal accidents in high-temperature operations and near gas operations. To this end, Gao Hua held first aid training classes to teach first aid methods; and according to the nature of the work sections, he established five first aid stations and trained 37 qualified workers to serve as first aid personnel. More than 100 people were treated in 1954 alone. For example, when hot blast furnace worker Zhang Bunian and others suffered coal poisoning, they received immediate first aid and were out of danger.
    Due to the heat of molten iron, many blast furnace workers suffer from interdigital erosion. Whether they are smelting iron, lifting iron, or casting molds, workers often feel uncomfortable in their toes and have difficulty walking. This is a historical occupational disease.
    As soon as Gao Hua arrived at the Iron Smelting Department, he noticed this occupational disease. He thought: If the workshop doctor cannot solve the occupational diseases in production, how can he talk about serving production? So he studied hard day and night and finally formulated a drug. Three hundred and four people with interdigital erosion have been treated with this medicine, and two hundred and ninety-one have been completely cured. Occupational diseases on the blast furnace have been basically eliminated.

    Serving the Workers Wholeheartedly
    Gao Hua leads the health station and has made great contributions to maintaining the health of more than 1,300 people and their families of four to five thousand people in the Iron Smelting Department in the past year, improving the attendance rate of the employees of the Iron Smelting Department, winning the praise of the leaders, and receiving the love of the masses. The workshop director praised him as the healthy nanny of the Iron Smelting Department, and the party general branch secretary said: "Gao Hua is really a good example for medical personnel!"
    When the production bonus was issued in the third quarter of 1954, the workers wanted to extract a portion to give to Gao Hua. The workers in Group A wanted to buy him a bicycle tire. They said: "Old Gao treats us, and the tires on his bike are almost worn out. Let's replace them with new ones to show our appreciation!" The workers in Group B wanted to buy him leather shoes. They said: "Gao Hua runs so diligently that many shoes are worn out." The workers in Group C said: "No matter what we send, it can't express our love for him. Let's buy a commemorative album and write our names on it to show that so many workers are always grateful to him!" Gao Hua did not accept any material gifts. He said: "This is my due responsibility!" Only the commemorative album was left behind. Later, the three groups of workers jointly presented him with a red flag with the words: "You are really a good doctor of our working class!"
    In early 1955, someone visited Gao Hua and asked him to talk about his experience. Gao Hua said sincerely: "I really can't talk about any experience. I just firmly remember Chairman Mao's words: Serve the people wholeheartedly."

    全心全意为工人服务的好医生
    冯育栋
    太原钢铁厂炼铁部保健站有一个好医生。只要一谈到他，谁都称道他真正是为公忘私、舍己为人。这个人就是模范医士高华。高华的模范事迹很多，今年评选模范中，不少人质问为什么不把他提出的事情写在材料上，评选模范的委员只好解释说：“咱们写材料的篇幅有限，怎么能把这么多事情都写上！”查查原始记录，高华仅业余出诊，一九五四年一年中就有一千三百四十七次；而业余诊疗，并不是他分内的工作哩！
    远路出诊
    二高炉上开卷扬机的工友张克亮，住在离厂二十多里的南寨村。全家只有三个人，小孩患了麻疹，爱人也生了病，他怎么能上班呢？但一想到厂里正搞竞赛，卷扬机上人手又少，张克亮还是拖着疲倦的身子上了班，但心里总不安定。
    这时候，高华调到炼铁部还不久，他听到张克亮的困难情况，便主动去找他。张克亮很为难地说：“离厂二十多里，怎么能请大夫去？你们现在也是工作时间，下了班谁不想休息休息？”高华坚决地回答道：“不要说二十里，就是四十里，我也可以去治病。”下了班，他们相偕到南寨村。给张克亮的老婆孩子治了病。
    住在东山丈子头的料仓工陈强的小孩得了重病。那里离厂十几里，路很难走。陈强又是晚班，夜十二点才下班。他请高华第二天早晨去看；或者他请假，在六点钟高华下班后一块走。高华说：“如果孩子病很重，明天去怕耽误了；如果你请假去，又影响生产。等你下班后一起走吧！”
    夜十二点，他们从厂出发。这时刚下过雪，走的又是山路，高华路不熟，途中滑了几跤。他跌倒了，爬起来再前进，丝毫没有怨言。陈强非常感激地说：“真太难为你了！”高华平静地回答：“孩子的性命要紧，当医生的跌几跤算什么呢！”
    到了陈强家，已是深夜两点。高华立即给小儿诊治，又告给陈强治疗的方法，小孩的病情显著好转了。陈强一再留他住宿，他坚持要回家去，说：
  “你想明天还有多少工人等我看病，我怎么能不赶回上班呢？”
    在归途中，寒风凛冽，高华虽然感到冬夜的严寒，觉得身体十分困倦，但心里很兴奋。他想：“又有一条小生命，由自己的手挽救过来了，这真是当医生的一种快乐。”
      阎世铎的转变
      一高炉泥工阎世铎原来是个落后的工人。他有些腰疼，本来是能够上班的；但他为了搬家，假装病情加重，给厂里捎去个条子，请两天假休息。
    高华每天都检查职工出勤情况。这天，见阎世铎请了病假，以为他的腰疼当真严重起来了。于是相约他的工长，下班后给他去看病。
    下午七点钟，他们到了阎世铎家里。一进门，屋里空洞洞地已经一无所有。问明邻居，他们又到阎世铎的新居。这时阎世铎正整顿他的家务，一见大夫和工长，羞惭得无话可说。高华严格地责备了他不老实的行为，但仍旧看了他的腰疼。阎世铎又惭愧又感动。他回炼铁部后写了检讨，作了保证。从此，再没有旷过工，而且每天早来迟走，努力生产，由落后的工人，转变为积极分子。
      和蔼、亲切
    高华在车间，工人们不称他“高大夫”，都亲切地叫他“老高”。他们有一点病情都能彻底、详细地告诉他。高华看病从来不知疲倦，从来不会厌烦。他问得仔细，看得耐心，工人和他无拘无束，像对自己的亲人一样，完全能把病情和盘托出。这就使他能把病源闹清，对症下药，容易把病治好。因此，高华在医学上、在药疗技术上，虽然并不怎么超群出众，但是他看过的病人要比别人多，他看好的病人更比别人多。
    整顿环境卫生，预防疾病
    高华不仅积极地为伤患者服务，而且用更多心力，做了预防疾病的工作。
    炼铁部这种冶炼生产部门，灰尘大，烟气多，原料复杂，本来是不容易搞好环境卫生的。但是，高华知道，只要发动起群众，没有克服不了的困难。他建议炼铁部领导上建立了卫生制度，每星期三大扫除。到时候，高华总要到工场上亲自洒扫。工人们见大夫还拿起笤帚，那一个还能袖手旁观？这样，一九五四年一年，炼铁部就从肮脏混乱的灰尘堆积中解放出来，成为整洁清净的车间。
    原料工段科仓底矿粉飞扬，严重影响工人健康。高华和修理工人郑华、傅永庆等一块商量，发动工人利用废料，在业余时间安装了一条水管，经常放水喷洒，粉尘问题大部获得解决。
    高华更重视卫生宣传工作。车间广播中常听到高华的声音，黑板报上常见高华写的材料，休息时间常看到高华给工人们讲解卫生常识。他常说：“防病要重于治病，保健要重于诊疗。”
    一个冬天的夜晚，他已上床休息，突然听到寒潮即将到来的消息。他知道高炉工人们没有准备，即使听到寒潮消息也常不注意，于是立即跑到厂里，告诉夜班工人们穿好衣服。工人们感动地说：
  “有高华这样的好医生关心我们，我们怎能不关心生产呢！”
    消灭历史性的职业病
    炼铁工人在高温作业和接近煤气操作情况下，常常发生人身事故。为此，高华举办了急救训练班，传授急救方法；并根据工段的性质，建立了五个急救站，训练合格的三十七个工人兼充急救员。一九五四年一年中经过救治的有一百多人。如热风炉工友张补年等四人中煤毒后，立即得到急救，脱离险境。
    高炉工人由于受铁水热气蒸腾，很多人害趾间糜烂症。不论炼铁、抬铁、铸模工人都经常感到足趾难受，行走困难。这是历史性的职业病。
    高华一到炼铁部，就注意到了这种职业病。他想：车间医生要解决不了生产上的职业病，怎又能谈到为生产服务？于是日夜苦心钻研，终于配制了一种药品。用这种药治疗过趾间糜烂症的有三百零四人，有二百九十一人彻底治愈，高炉上的职业病基本上消灭了。
    全心全意为工人服务
    高华领导着保健站，一年来对维护炼铁部一千三百多人及其眷属四、五千人的健康有很大贡献，提高了炼铁部职工的出勤率，获得领导的表扬，受到群众的爱戴。车间主任称赞他是炼铁部健康的保姆，党总支书记说：“高华真是医务人员的好榜样！”
    一九五四年第三季发生产奖励金时，工人们要提取一部分给高华。甲班工人要给他买自行车带。他们说：“老高给我们看病，把车带也快磨光了，换一付新的表表咱们的心吧！”乙班工人要给他买皮鞋。他们说：“高华跑得这样勤，多少鞋也磨烂了。”丙班工人说：“送什么也表达不出我们热爱他的心，买上一本纪念册，把我们的名字都写上，表示有这么多工人时刻感激他哩！”高华对于物质赠品，都没接受。他说：“这是我应尽的责任！”光把纪念册留下了。后来三班工人一起赠送他一面红旗，上写：“你真是我们工人阶级的好大夫！”
    一九五五年初，有人访问高华，请他谈谈经验。高华诚恳地说：“我实在谈不上什么经验，我只是牢牢地记住了毛主席的话：全心全意为人民服务。”
