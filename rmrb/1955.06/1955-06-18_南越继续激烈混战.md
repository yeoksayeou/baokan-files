Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 17th: Saigon Dispatch: The troops of the American puppet Ngo Dinh Diem and the Hoa Hao army engaged in fierce battles on the south bank of the Mekong River. Ngo Dinh Diem concentrated fifteen battalions of troops, supported by some aircraft, artillery, and warships, in an attempt to encircle and annihilate the Hoa Hao army under the command of Le Quang Vinh in the Thu Luc area between Can Tho and Long Xuyen. In the two days of fighting on the 15th and 16th, more than one hundred people were killed or wounded on both sides.

It is reported that many Hoa Hao troops have crossed the Mekong River, infiltrated the Dong Thap Muoi plain about seventy miles west of Saigon, and shelled Cao Lanh city on the edge of this plain on the evening of the 14th. Agence France-Presse said that the terrain of the vast Dong Thap Muoi plain is "ideal" for guerrilla warfare.

With American support, Ngo Dinh Diem continues to take measures to eliminate opposing forces. Due to the pressure from Ngo Dinh Diem elements, the Bao Dai "Royal Family Council" in Hue, Central Vietnam, announced on the 16th that it was stripping Bao Dai of his "Head of State" title and demanding that Ngo Dinh Diem serve as the "Provisional President" of South Vietnam. Prior to this, the so-called "Revolutionary Committee" organized by Ngo Dinh Diem elements in Hue had entered Bao Dai's palace, confiscated Bao Dai's "national seal," and closed his office. Several members of Bao Dai's royal family have been imprisoned.

In Saigon, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, again under the pretext of "colluding with rebels," ordered the confiscation of the property of sixteen of his political enemies, including the property of Nguyen Van Hinh, the former Chief of Staff of the South Vietnamese Army.

    南越继续激烈混战
    新华社河内十七日电　西贡消息：美国傀儡吴庭艳的军队同和好教军队在湄公河南岸发生激烈的战斗。吴庭艳集中了十五个营的军队，在一些飞机、大炮和舰艇的支援下，企图围歼芹苴和龙川之间秃碌地区的属于黎光永指挥的和好教军队。双方在十五日、十六日两天战斗中已经有一百多人伤亡。
    据报道，已有不少和好教军队渡过湄公河，渗入西贡西面约七十英里的同塔梅平原，并曾在十四日晚炮轰这个平原边缘的高岭城。法新社说，广阔的同塔梅平原的地形对于游击战是“理想的”。
    得到美国支持的吴庭艳继续采取铲除反对势力的措施。由于吴庭艳分子的压力，在中越顺化的保大“皇族议会”已在十六日宣布剥夺保大的“元首”职权，并要求吴庭艳出任南越的“临时总统”。在这以前，由顺化吴庭艳分子组织的所谓“革命委员会”曾进入保大的皇宫没收保大的“国玺”，封闭了他的办公室。保大皇族多人已被关进监牢。
    在西贡，吴庭艳当局又以“和叛乱分子勾结”的名义，下令没收他的十六个政敌的财产，其中包括前南越陆军参谋长阮文馨的财产。
