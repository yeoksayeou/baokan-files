    Hangzhou Hongfeng Silk Factory Improves Silkworm Chrysalis Oil Yield
    Workers in the oil refining workshop of the Zhejiang Provincial Local State-Owned Hangzhou Hongfeng Silk Factory are actively learning advanced methods for extracting silkworm pupa oil, continuously increasing the oil yield. Currently, the oil yield has reached a record of 32.12 percent.
    The oil refining workshop of this factory was newly built after learning advanced experience from silk factories in Suzhou, and it was put into production in November 1954. In the first three months, the oil yield was only about 20 percent, 3.67 percentage points lower than planned. The workers further studied the advanced experience of other factories in extracting silkworm pupa oil and the methods of Li Chuanjiang. In February of this year, the oil yield reached 28.42 percent. At this time, the workers found that the key to improving the oil yield was: raw wet silkworm chrysalises must be processed quickly to prevent rot; the moisture content of the silkworm chrysalises should not exceed 6 percent; oil and water must be separated clearly using an "oil-water separator"; silkworm chrysalises must be crushed before being put into the leaching tank, etc. After mastering these key points and modifying the improperly installed mechanical equipment, the oil yield increased significantly. In March and April, it reached over 31 percent, and in May, it exceeded 32 percent.
    Calculated from the annual planned oil yield of 25 percent reported by the factory in 1955, this factory can increase the production of silkworm pupa oil by more than 89,800 jin for the country throughout the year. (Xu Dejing)

    杭州鸿丰丝厂蚕蛹出油率提高
    浙江省地方国营杭州鸿丰丝厂炼油间职工，积极学习先进的提炼蚕蛹油方法，不断提高出油率。目前，出油率已经达到百分之三十二点一二的纪录。
    这个厂的炼油间是学习了苏州的丝厂的先进经验以后新建的，从一九五四年十一月投入生产。头三个月，出油率只是百分之二十左右，比计划低三点六七。职工们进一步学习了其他厂提炼蚕蛹油的先进经验和李川江的方法，今年二月间出油率达到百分之二十八点四二。这时职工们找到了提高出油率的关键是：原料湿蚕蛹要迅速处理，防止污烂，蚕蛹含水量不能超过百分之六；必须用“油水分离器”分清油和水；蚕蛹在未放入浸出桶之前就要进行破碎，等等。掌握了这些关键，并对装置不当的机械设备作了改装以后，出油率更显著提高，三、四月份达到百分之三十一以上，到五月间突破百分之三十二。
    从一九五五年上报年度计划出油率百分之二十五计算，这个厂全年可为国家增产蚕蛹油八万九千八百多斤。　（徐德径）
