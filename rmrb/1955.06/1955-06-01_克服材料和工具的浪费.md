    Overcoming Waste of Materials and Tools
    Zhong Qu
    The Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company exceeded its construction plan by eight percent last year. However, the accumulation and waste of materials and tools were also very serious. According to the requirements of the higher authorities, this year the company's construction cost should be reduced by ten percent compared with the budget quota issued by the state last year. In order to complete this task, the company recently combined the anti-waste campaign and focused on checking the waste of materials and tools.

    The facts revealed by the inspection team and the masses show that the waste of materials and tools in the company is serious and widespread. Due to random use and chaotic management, more than 500 iron shovels were lost when the first phase of the project was completed last year. Before October, more than 140 pieces of mechanical equipment and tools were lost. The No. 2 construction site used precast floor slabs from other construction sites to support the concrete platform formwork, and the No. 3 construction site cut off whole scaffolding boards to support the septic tank formwork. During the construction of the second phase of the project, the plaster falling from the indoor plastering was generally five or six centimeters thick, and after drying, it was thrown away as waste soil. Many bricklayers, in order to speed up bricklaying, pushed the half bricks picked up on the scaffolding down. When half bricks were needed, they broke the whole bricks. After the workers finished their work, the remaining materials were discarded in the field at will. Once, when the processing plant was making concrete prefabricated components, seven bags of cement were lost. When they were found, they had become hard lumps like stones. Carpenters often cut off and use high-quality, whole and long materials. Last year, the board heads, square timbers, and bark sawn off were sold as firewood for more than 1.284 million catties. The employees said: "We have simply become a firewood company."

    After the completion of the project, the material and tool recovery and property inventory work were also very rough and careless. Before the completion of the second phase of the project last year, the scattered materials on the site were not counted, stacked, and returned to the warehouse, so that the plumbing outer line team buried a large number of materials underground when burying the trenches and bulldozers leveled the site. During this inspection, 33 cubic meters of pure sand, 50 cubic meters of pebbles, more than 60 scaffolding boards, a flat iron cart, and more than 3,000 kilograms of steel bars and iron wires were excavated, as well as many hollow bricks, blue machine bricks, ridge tiles, plumbing iron fittings, pipes, and iron bars. The total value of these discarded and buried materials and tools was more than 13,000 yuan. This is only a part of what was discovered. It is estimated that there are still many materials and tools that have not been discovered and excavated.

    The accumulation of materials and tools is also serious. Last year, the Hydropower Section purchased 1,252 water test rubber plugs, but only 50 were used, and the accumulated water test rubber plugs were worth more than 15,800 yuan. During the rainy season construction last year, the No. 2 construction site proposed to purchase more than 6,000 feet of tarpaulin, but only more than 900 feet were received, and the rest were accumulated in the warehouse. When the third phase of the project started, 20,000 kilograms of waterproof powder were needed. The construction site bought it themselves and notified the company to purchase it. As a result, the purchase was duplicated, and the accumulated funds were 8,967 yuan.

    The main reasons for the accumulation and waste of materials and tools are, first of all, each construction site blindly reserves materials and blindly adds to the number of materials in order to catch up with the progress and rush the work. They often buy them back and then don't need them. Originally, materials and tools were managed centrally by the company, but each construction site almost established a small warehouse for their own convenience.

    Secondly, most construction sites lack the concept of economic accounting, and the management system of various materials and tools cannot be implemented. The quota for material requisition has become a formality. When the production team does not have enough materials, they can requisition them at any time, and the surplus materials are not returned to the warehouse. Engineering and technical personnel also lack accounting when using materials, and they do not actively try to use by-products of materials (such as bean dregs stone, etc.) and usable waste materials.

    Each construction site has not done enough education for workers on saving materials. Some workers, in order to catch up with the progress and get extra money, do not requisition materials in accordance with the material management system. They are willing to requisition more or use whatever they can get, and the foremen do not ask, and even think that the team's production is not bad, and it doesn't matter if some materials are wasted!

    The waste of materials and tools has a great impact on construction. Last year, during the rainy season, when the main projects of the south and north auxiliary buildings of the second construction period were under intense construction, the supply of pebbles suddenly could not keep up, and it was about to stop work and wait for materials. The relevant staff of the construction site and the company were anxious. In order not to delay the construction period, the manager personally went to the equipment company and other places to negotiate materials, but because of the difficulties in transportation during the rainy season, distant water could not quench the immediate thirst. At this time, unexpectedly, the construction site dug out more than 100 cubic meters of gravel in the courtyard.

    In order to learn from past lessons, reverse the chaotic phenomenon of material and tool management, overcome and eliminate accumulation and waste, save funds, and effectively complete this year's target of reducing construction costs, the company decided to strengthen material and tool management in this anti-waste campaign, and also handled the accumulated materials and tools in the past.

    The specific methods are: The accumulated materials and tools caused by design changes will be jointly resolved by the client and the company; those caused by inadequate material planning will be transferred by the company to other fraternal companies, or transferred to other units through the Construction Bank. Now 270,000 blue machine bricks have been transferred to other places, and white iron pipes and other items worth about 50,000 yuan have been transferred and processed. Other accumulated materials and tools are also being continuously processed.

    In terms of strengthening material and tool management, first of all, the management organization of materials and tools was reorganized, and necessary adjustments were made to the material and tool management personnel. The material and tool supply section of the company added a finance group, specializing in the capital management of materials and tools and began to implement material and tool cost accounting. It is currently preparing to promote the project acceptance system in order to further control the use of materials in the project. In order to promote the reduction of material loss rate and properly handle old and residual materials, it is determined in the construction organization technical measures plan that old wood should be fully used on the premise of not affecting the quality of the project. At the same time, the quota system for material requisition was fully implemented. Each construction site implemented quota for material requisition for materials such as sand and stone that were stored in large piles outdoors. Sand and stone were cleared when they were used up. A centralized management method was adopted for wood in order to adjust the use and allocate materials according to the specific needs of the project.

    In order to implement the above measures, each construction site held a mobilization meeting for the anti-waste campaign. Each production team launched heated criticisms and self-criticisms against the waste of materials and tools in the past. Many teams submitted letters of guarantee for saving materials to the leaders, guaranteeing that the operating site would never drop materials after finishing the work. On the premise of not affecting the quality of the project, the method of piecing together one new material and one old material was adopted, and a total of 984 cubic meters of old wood was used. There were also great savings in bricklaying. The staff dormitory buildings built by the seventh and eighth construction sites were expected to use 64,400 bricks per floor according to the design quota, but only 59,600 bricks were actually used.

### 克服材料和工具的浪费

    克服材料和工具的浪费
    仲曲
    北京市第三建筑工程公司去年曾超额百分之八完成了施工计划。但是材料、工具的积压、浪费现象也非常严重。根据上级的要求，今年这个公司的建筑成本要比去年国家颁布的预算定额降低百分之十。为了完成这项任务，最近公司结合反浪费运动，着重检查了材料、工具的浪费情况。
    检查组和群众揭发出来的事实说明，公司材料工具的浪费是严重而普遍的。由于乱拉乱用，管理混乱，去年一期工程完工时，铁锨少了五百多把，在十月份以前，机械用具、工具丢失了一百四十多件。二工地曾使用别的工地的预制楼板支混凝土平台模板，三工地曾截断整块的脚手板支化粪池模板。二期工程施工时，室内抹灰掉下的灰浆普遍有五、六公分厚，干后都当废土扔掉了。有不少瓦工砌砖时为了快，把挑到架子上的半头砖推下去，需用半头砖时又把整块的砖打碎。工人做完了活以后，剩余材料随便丢弃在场地上。一次，加工厂在做混凝土预制构件时，丢下七袋水泥，发现时，已变成石头似的硬块了。木工们经常把优材、整材、长料截断使用。去年光锯断的板子头、方楞、板皮等，就当劈材卖掉了一百二十八万四千多斤，职工说：
  “我们简直成了劈材公司了。”
    在工程完工以后，材料、工具回收和清产核资工作做得也是非常粗糙马虎的。去年第二期工程交工前，没有把现场零散材料清点码垛和退库，以致水暖工外线队在埋沟时和推土机平整现场时，把大量材料埋在地下。这次检查时，挖出纯沙三十三立方公尺，卵石五十立方公尺，脚手板六十多块，平板铁车一辆，钢筋、铁丝等三千余公斤，还有很多空心砖、蓝机砖、脊瓦、水暖铁活、管子、铁筋等。这些被丢弃、埋掉的材料工具共值一万三千余元。这还仅是发现的一部分。未被发现挖掘的材料工具估计还有很多。
    材料工具的积压也是严重的。去年水电科购进试水胶堵一千二百五十二个，只用了五十个，积压的试水胶堵价值一万五千八百多元。去年雨季施工时，二工地提出要购买油布六千多尺，但实际上只领了九百余尺，其余都积压在仓库里。第三期工程开工时，需要防水粉两万公斤，工地自己买了，又通知公司采购，结果因买重了，积压资金八千九百六十七元。
    造成材料工具的积压、浪费的主要原因，首先是各工地为了赶进度、抢工，盲目储备材料，盲目追加材料数额，常常买回来以后又不要了。本来材料工具是由公司集中管理的，但各工地为了自己方便，差不多都各自建立一个小仓库。
    其次是多数工地缺乏经济核算思想，各种材料工具的管理制度不能贯彻，限额领料变成了形式，生产小组材料不够时，可以随时提领，余料也不退库。工程技术人员用材料时也缺乏核算，对材料的副产品（如豆碴石等），以及可以利用的废料，都不积极设法利用。
    各工地对工人进行节约材料的教育也做得不够，有些工人为了赶进度，超额多拿钱，不按照材料管理制度领料，愿意多领一些或随手拈来就用，而工长也不过问，甚至认为小组生产还不错，糟蹋些材料没啥！
    材料工具的浪费对施工的影响是很大的。去年雨季，第二工期南、北配楼主体工程正在紧张施工时，突然卵石供应不上了，眼看要停工待料，工地、公司的有关工作人员急得团团转。为了不延误工期，经理亲自出马到器材公司等处交涉材料，但因雨季运转困难，远水不解近渴。正在这时，想不到工地却在大院内挖出了一百余立方公尺石子。
    为了吸取过去的教训，扭转材料工具管理的混乱现象，克服和杜绝积压、浪费，节约资财，切实完成今年降低建筑成本指标，公司在这次反浪费运动中，决定要加强材料工具管理，把过去积压的材料、工具也作了处理。
    具体做法是：积压的材料和工具，因为设计变更所造成的，由委托单位和公司共同解决；因为材料计划不周造成的，由公司负责向其他兄弟公司调拨，或通过建设银行向其他单位调拨。现在已将积压的蓝机砖向外调拨了二十七万块，白铁管等向外调拨处理了价值约五万余元，其他积压的材料工具也正在继续设法处理。
    在加强材料工具管理方面，首先改编了材料工具的管理组织，对材料、工具管理人员进行了必要的调整。公司的料、具供应科增设了财务组，专门负责材料、工具的资金管理并开始实行材料、工具成本核算。目前正准备推行工程验收制度，以进一步控制工程用料。为了推动降低材料损耗率，妥善处理旧料、残料，在施工组织技术措施计划中确定在不影响工程质量的前提下，充分使用旧木料。与此同时，又全面推行了限额领料制度。各工地对沙、石等大堆露天存放的材料都实行了限额领料，沙、石等使用完时都做了清底工作。对木料采取了集中管理的办法，以便调剂使用，按照工程的具体需要配料。
    为了贯彻以上措施，各工地分别召开了反浪费运动动员大会。各生产小组针对以往材料工具的浪费情况，展开了热烈的批评和自我批评。许多小组纷纷向领导方面提出节约材料的保证书，保证做完活以后，操作场地绝不拉掉材料。在不影响工程质量的条件下，采取一块新料一块旧料的办法拼凑使用，共利用了旧木料九百八十四立方公尺。在砌砖方面也有很大节省，第七、第八工地承建的职工宿舍楼，按设计预计定额，每一层楼需用砖六万四千四百块，实际只用了五万九千六百块。
