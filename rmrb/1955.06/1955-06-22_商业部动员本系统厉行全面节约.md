Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The Ministry of Commerce has mobilized all units within its system to practice comprehensive economy. On the 14th, the Ministry of Commerce, its affiliated specialized companies, and the Central Commercial Cadre School jointly held a staff meeting. Wang Xingrang, Vice Minister of Commerce, conveyed the central government's spirit and requirements for comprehensive economy, and pointed out the current waste existing within the state-owned commercial system. Wang Xingrang also said that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy within the Ministry of Commerce system is significant. If savings of one percent in expenses can be achieved in the commodity circulation process, it could save the country several hundred million yuan annually. In terms of capital construction, if non-productive construction projects can be reduced and building standards appropriately lowered, a large amount of capital can also be saved. Wang Xingrang called on the commercial system's employees to strive to complete the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy in accordance with the state's requirements.
    Currently, the Ministry of Commerce system, with the China Food Company as the focal point, has launched a labor emulation campaign to increase production and practice economy. Other specialized companies will also formulate specific plans based on their own circumstances to carry out comprehensive economy.
    After careful study, the Ministry of Commerce has proposed a plan to reduce capital construction investment by 50 million yuan over the three years from 1955 to 1957, and has issued instructions to its subordinate units, requiring them to conduct a thorough review of this year's capital construction plans within ten days and propose appropriate arrangements. In order to successfully complete this work, the Ministry of Commerce has dispatched inspection teams to various regions to inspect and assist in revising capital construction plans.

    商业部动员本系统厉行全面节约
    新华社二十日讯　商业部动员本系统各单位厉行全面节约。十四日，商业部和所属各专业公司、中央商业干部学校联合举行了职工大会。商业部副部长王兴让在会上传达了中央关于全面节约的精神和要求，并指出国营商业系统中目前存在着的浪费情况。王兴让并说，商业部系统实行增产节约的潜力很大，如果在商品流转过程中能节约费用百分之一，一年就可为国家节省费用几亿元，在基本建设方面如能减少非生产性建筑的项目，并适当降低建筑标准，也可节约大量资金。王兴让号召商业系统的职工要按照国家的要求，努力完成增产节约任务。
    目前，商业部系统以中国食品公司为重点，开展了增产节约劳动竞赛，其他各专业公司也将根据本身情况，制定具体方案，开展全面节约。
    商业部经过细致的研究，已提出在一九五五年到一九五七年三年中减少基本建设投资五千万元的计划，并向所属发出指示，要求在十日内对今年的基本建设计划进行周密的审查，提出适当的安排办法。为了顺利完成这一工作，商业部已派出检查组分赴各地检查和协助修订基本建设计划的工作。
