    Northwest Metal Structure Factory Under Construction
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
    Surrounded by the endless golden wheat fields on the outskirts of Xi'an, the first permanent metal structure factory in the Northwest is under construction.
    Previously, there were no metal structure factories in the Northwest region. Steel roof trusses, crane beams, and other components used for new factory buildings were often transported from other regions, or temporarily processed using old production methods, which often affected project progress due to untimely supply. In the future, many large-scale factories will be built in the Northwest region, and most of the factory buildings will be metal structures. Without a permanent metal structure factory, it would bring great difficulties to the construction of these new factories.
    Large-scale industrial construction must adopt the advanced experience of factory construction. The establishment of this metal structure factory is one of the most important measures to adopt factory construction in the Northwest region's construction. This factory produces a large number of heavy and medium-sized steel roof trusses, crane beams, steel columns and other main products, as well as auxiliary products such as boilers and water tanks. The steel roof trusses it produces annually (calculated on a two-shift production basis) can build two to three hundred thousand square meters of factory buildings. These steel roof trusses can be installed without processing after being transported to the construction site. This can ensure the quality of steel components and ensure the timely supply for the needs of new factory construction.
    The Northwest Metal Structure Factory is designed according to the advanced Soviet metal structure factory design. The factory has preparation, processing, assembly, painting, and mechanical repair workshops. Various new types of machinery and equipment will be installed in the workshops. Each workshop is arranged according to the advanced assembly line method, and these workshops are connected into a whole by small-scale railways. When production starts, steel will be transported directly by train to the factory's preparation workshop, where the workshop workers will conduct quality inspection and straighten and flatten the steel with straightening machines and flattening machines, and then transport it to the processing workshop via small-scale railways. In the processing workshop, workers will perform numbering, cutting, drilling, and straightening of the steel according to the drawings, and then transport it to the assembly workshop. The workers in the assembly workshop first piece together the steel, and then use automatic welding machines to carry out welding work, and various steels are made into finished products here. After the finished products are painted with anti-rust paint in the painting workshop, they are directly loaded onto trains and transported to various construction sites.
    This factory started construction on November 15 last year. The original East China Third Engineering Company, which supports the construction of Xi'an, is responsible for the construction. Almost all the workers had just arrived in Xi'an and participated in the construction of this arduous project. At that time, there was nothing on the construction site except building materials. They lived in temporary thatched sheds, and even the drinking water was transported from outside. Especially when the cold winter was just beginning, it was quite difficult for the workers who grew up in the south. However, these difficulties were also expected by them long ago. Many people thought when they set off from Shanghai: It is not an easy task to build huge factories from the ground up in the interior of the motherland, and all kinds of difficulties will be encountered in the construction. Therefore, they did not complain in the face of difficulties, but attacked the difficulties with a heroic attitude. The young people organized youth shock brigades and launched labor competitions throughout the construction site to fight against the cold season and carry out winter construction tenaciously.
    Here, heroic deeds appear almost every moment. These deeds quickly spread on the construction site, and inspired all the workers to create new heroic deeds. For example, the news that "the young workers digging earthwork exceeded the quota by an average of 80 percent per person..." was soon followed by the good news that "the sampling workers completed 180 channel steels in three hours, exceeding the quota by 9.6 tons..."
    During the intense winter construction, all the workers proposed: no matter how great the difficulties are, we must ensure the quality and progress of the project. They know that this project is the beginning of large-scale industrial construction in the Northwest, and many huge factories rely on it to supply steel components. If this project is delayed, it is equivalent to prolonging the progress of large-scale industrial construction; if the quality of this project cannot be guaranteed, it may affect the quality of many projects. Therefore, the quality of the project must not be careless; the progress of the project must not be delayed. The vast number of workers completed their tasks with the most serious attitude. After intense winter construction, the huge factory building was built. Now, the machine installation project has begun.
    The Northwest Metal Structure Factory plans to officially start production in October this year. At that time, newly manufactured steel frames, steel beams and columns, and crane beams and other components will be transported from here to construction sites in Xi'an, Lanzhou and other regions.

### 正在建设的西北金属结构工厂

    正在建设的西北金属结构工厂
    本报记者　朱波
    在西安郊区一望无际的金黄色麦浪的环抱中，正在建设着西北第一座永久性的金属结构工厂。
    以前，西北地区没有金属结构工厂。新建厂房所用的钢铁屋架、吊车梁等构件，很多是从其它地区运来的，或者是用旧的生产方法临时加工的，常常因为供应不及时而影响工程进度。今后，西北地区将要建设许多巨型的工厂，厂房大部分是金属结构，如果没有一座永久性的金属结构工厂，将会给这些新厂的建设带来很大的困难。
    大规模的工业建设，一定要采取工厂化施工的先进经验。这座金属结构工厂的建立，就是在西北地区的建设中采用工厂化施工的最重要的措施之一。这个厂大量生产重型和中型的钢铁屋架，吊车梁、钢柱等主要产品，以及锅炉、水箱等辅助产品。它每年生产的钢铁屋架（按两班生产计算），可以建筑二、三十万平方公尺的厂房，这些钢铁屋架运到工地后，用不着加工就可以安装。这就能保证钢铁构件的质量，并且可以保证及时供应新厂建设的需要。
    西北金属结构工厂是按照苏联先进的金属结构工厂设计的。全厂有准备、加工、装配、油漆及机械修理等车间。车间里将安装各种新型的机器设备。每个车间都是按着先进的流水作业法分布的，并由小型的铁轨把这些车间连成一个整体。等到开工生产时，直接用火车把钢材运到工厂的准备车间，由这个车间职工进行质量检查，并用调直机和压平机把钢材调直压平，然后就经小型铁轨运往加工车间。在加工车间里，职工根据图纸进行号料、剪切、钻孔以及用矫直机把钢材整理好，就运到装配车间。装配车间的工人先把钢材拼镶起来，然后就用自动电焊机进行焊接工作，各种钢材在这里就制成了成品。成品再经油漆车间刷上防锈油漆后，直接装上火车运往各个工地。
    这个工厂是在去年十一月十五日开始修建的。负责施工的是支援西安建设的原华东第三工程公司。职工们差不多都刚刚来到西安，就参加建设这项艰巨的工程。当时，施工现场除了建筑材料外什么都没有。他们住的是临时搭起来的草棚，连吃的水都是从外边运来的。特别是刚刚开工就遇到寒冷的冬天，这对生长在南方的职工来说是相当大的困难。但是，这些困难也是他们早就意料到的。许多人从上海动身时就曾想过：在祖国的内地，要把一座一座巨大的工厂从平地上建设起来，这不是一件容易的事情，在建设中什么样的困难都会遇到。因此，他们在困难面前并没有叫苦，而是以英雄的姿态向困难进攻。青年们组织了青年突击队，并在整个工地上发起劳动竞赛，来对抗寒冷的季节，顽强地进行冬季施工。
    在这里，差不多每时每刻都出现着英雄的事迹。这些事迹很快地在工地上传播开来，又鼓舞着全体职工创造新的英雄事迹。例如：“挖土方的青年工人平均每人超过定额百分之八十……”的消息传出不久，就又传来“出样工人三小时完成了一百八十根槽钢，超额完成九点六吨……”的捷报。
    在紧张的冬季施工中，全体职工提出：不管有多大的困难，一定保证工程的质量和工程进度。他们知道这项工程是西北进行大规模工业建设的开始，许多巨大的工厂要靠它供给钢铁构件。如果这项工程延期就等于拖长了大规模的工业建设的进度；如果这项工程的质量不能保证，就有可能影响许多工程的质量。因此，工程质量一点都不能马虎；工程的进度一点都不能拖延。广大职工都以最认真的态度来完成自己的工作任务。经过紧张的冬季施工，巨大的厂房建设起来了。现在，又开始了机器安装工程。
    西北金属结构工厂计划在今年十月正式开工生产。那时候，新制造的钢铁房架、钢铁梁柱以及吊车梁等构件，将从这里运到西安、兰州等地区的工地上去。
