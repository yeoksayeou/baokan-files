Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. "Pravda" published a report from its Belgrade correspondents Yu. Zhukov and V. Mayevsky on the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet talks.

They said: The just-concluded Sino-Soviet talks are the focus of attention for people of all countries. Yugoslav newspapers are enthusiastically commenting on the conclusion of the talks. For example, the Skopje newspaper "New Macedonia" emphasized that the Belgrade talks will be recorded in international history as a valuable contribution to the settlement of relations between countries, and as a basis for further improvement of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.

The "Pravda" reporter pointed out that the results of the Sino-Soviet talks have been unanimously supported in people's democratic countries.

Communist newspapers in many countries have also emphasized the great international significance of the Belgrade talks. Many newspapers in India, Germany and Egypt have emphasized the positive results of the Sino-Soviet talks.

The reporter said: Those bourgeois figures who can calmly assess international events and who, for some reason, are concerned about easing international tensions, have also given positive comments on the results of the Sino-Soviet talks. Agence France-Presse clearly reflected the sentiments of these people. It pointed out that the just-concluded Sino-Soviet talks are a great victory in maintaining peace.

The "Pravda" reporter said: However, those bourgeois figures who do not want peace but are keen on constantly intensifying the "Cold War" have undisguisedly expressed frustration and resentment at the results of the Belgrade talks. Many American newspaper reporters stubbornly refuse to consider the facts, deliberately poison the international atmosphere, and spread seeds of distrust and malice everywhere.

The reporter said: "The New York Times" is advising the Yugoslav leaders not to agree to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union under any circumstances. This newspaper obviously knows that this advice will not produce the desired effect, so it immediately adopts the most rude and shameless pressure, and brazenly insists that Yugoslavia relies on the West. It is not difficult to see that this statement by the American newspapers is detrimental to those who are willing to obstruct the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations at any cost, because "The New York Times" blurted out what they wanted in their hearts. The "Pravda" reporter said: British bourgeois newspapers have different comments. London comforts itself with the hope that Yugoslavia will agree to play the role of a mediator. Reuters, for example, said that Yugoslavia will try to make the Soviet leaders accept the views of Western countries. This speculation reflects their obvious lack of understanding of the significance of the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, which is built on the basis of complete equality of rights and mutual respect for sovereignty.

### “真理报”记者关于苏南会谈结束的报道

    “真理报”记者关于苏南会谈结束的报道
    新华社三日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：“真理报”刊载了它在贝尔格莱德的记者尤·茹科夫和维·马耶夫斯基关于苏南会谈结束的报道。
    他们说：刚刚结束的苏南会谈是一切国家的社会人士注目的中心。南斯拉夫报纸都在热烈地评论会谈的结束，例如斯科普里的报纸“新马其顿”着重指出：贝尔格莱德会谈将载入国际史中，成为对解决国家和国家之间的关系的宝贵贡献，成为南斯拉夫和苏联之间的关系进一步改善的基础。
    “真理报”记者指出，苏南会谈的结果在人民民主国家中得到一致的拥护。
    许多国家的共产党报纸也强调指出贝尔格莱德会谈的巨大国际意义。印度、德国和埃及的许多报纸强调指出苏南会谈的积极结果。
    记者说：那些能够冷静地估计国际事件，同时因某种原因关心缓和国际紧张局势的资产阶级人士，也对苏南会谈的结果作了好评。法新社明显地反映了这些人士的情绪。它指出：刚刚结束的苏南会谈是维护和平方面的一个巨大胜利。
    “真理报”记者说：但是，那些不要和平而热中于不断加紧“冷战”的资产阶级人士，对于贝尔格莱德会谈的结果却毫不隐蔽地表示丧气和怨恨。许多美国报纸记者就顽固地不愿考虑事实，故意毒化国际气氛，到处散布不信任和恶意的种子。
    记者说：“纽约时报”正在劝告南斯拉夫领袖无论如何不要同意同苏联建立友好关系。这家报纸显然知道这种劝告不会产生预期的效果，因此立刻采取最粗鲁的和无耻的压力，大言不惭地硬说南斯拉夫是依靠西方的。不难看出，美国报纸的这种说法对于那些愿意不惜任何代价阻挠苏南关系正常化的人们反而不利，因为“纽约时报”脱口说出了他们心目中所想望的东西。“真理报”记者说：英国资产阶级报纸有不同的评论。伦敦用这种希望来安慰自己：南斯拉夫将同意扮演一种调停人的角色，像路透社就说，南斯拉夫将设法使苏联领袖们接受西方国家的观点。这种推测反映出他们显然不了解苏联和南斯拉夫关系正常化的意义，这种关系是建筑在权利完全平等和互相尊重主权的基础之上的。
