    The 149,000 mu of cotton planted by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps this year are generally growing well. The temperature in various reclamation areas this year is more normal than in previous years, which is very beneficial to cotton growth. According to records from a certain unit in the Manas Reclamation Area, cotton emergence was 15 days earlier than in 1954, and budding was 20 days earlier than in 1954. By mid-June, all cotton fields had been cultivated twice, with some reaching three or four times, and fertilizer was applied and watered once. Now the cotton is growing lush with branches and leaves, the plants are generally 15 to 30 centimeters high, and 7 to 8 flower buds have grown. In mid-June, most areas began to remove the lower leaves from the cotton plants, and this work is expected to be completed by the end of the month.

    新疆各垦区棉花生长良好
    新疆生产建设部队今年种植的十四万九千多亩棉花，普遍生长良好。今年各垦区气温较往年正常，对棉花生长十分有利。据玛纳斯垦区某部记载，棉花出苗比一九五四年提早了十五天，现蕾期比一九五四年提早二十天，到六月中旬，全部棉田已中耕二次，最多的达三、四次，追肥、浇水一次。现在棉花长得枝叶茂盛，植株一般高达十五到三十公分，生长出七到八个花蕾、六月中旬，大部地区开始进行棉花脱裤腿工作，这一工作预计月底可全部结束。
