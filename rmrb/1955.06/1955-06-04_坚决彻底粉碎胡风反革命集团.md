Resolutely and Thoroughly Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
We Must Investigate the Political Background of the Hu Feng Group

Letter from Meng Guangshan, a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: After the exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party group's criminal facts, the coastal defense soldiers gnash their teeth and hate him to the bone. Hu Feng, the counter-revolutionary culprit lurking in our ranks, not only deployed troops to deal with us with "strength" when the revolution was going through a difficult period, but also actively cooperated with imperialism to carry out internal and external attacks on our Party after the national liberation, when 600 million people were united as one around the Party and Chairman Mao, full of confidence in carrying out socialist construction. How vicious and shameless!

In the early days of liberation, while our Party was busy with economic recovery work, Hu Feng intensified his organizational activities for restoration and formulated a complete anti-Party organizational program. Who else besides Chiang Kai-shek, imperialism, and counter-revolutionaries has such determination to oppose the Party and the people? Didn't Chiang Kai-shek boast in Taiwan about "one year of preparation, two years of counter-attack, three years of mopping up, and five years of success"? What is the difference between this and what Hu Feng said? The anti-Party culprit Hu Feng, "never gives up until he reaches the Yellow River," and is determined to be an enemy of the Party and the people to the end. His "far-reaching future" is no different from the "future" that the American imperialist spies are waiting for every day.

We warn Hu Feng and those who follow him: We have the strong leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and we have a powerful modernized national defense army. Your expectation of Chiang Kai-shek's restoration will forever only be a dream.

Letter from Xu Shouchang and Zhang Shouen, base point work team of the Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hebei Province: We are rural workers. At first, we mistakenly believed that the "opinions" submitted by Hu Feng to the Party Central Committee were merely issues of literary thought, and naively thought: Hu Feng is idle and bored, instead of writing more than 100,000 words of "opinions," why not use this effort to write a good novel for young people. Later, after seeing the two batches of materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party group continuously exposed in the "People's Daily," we became sober. It turned out that Hu Feng was a thorough anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary element. He viciously slandered the Party's literary and artistic policies, slandered the responsible comrades of the Party, and cursed the Party member writers and all progressive writers in literary and art circles. He painstakingly expanded his "strength," organized an anti-Party group, and launched a frantic attack on the literary and artistic front led by the Party. On the surface, he followed the Party and the people, but secretly accelerated "sharpening my sword, spying on the direction," and carrying out counter-revolutionary activities. He instigated his anti-Party group members to infiltrate the Party and revolutionary organizations to establish strongholds, and used despicable and shameless means to steal Party documents. He encouraged his group members to "seek rebirth in suffering" and pinned their hopes on the restoration of the counter-revolutionary regime. From this point of view, Hu Feng, this counter-revolutionary fellow, is determined to be an enemy of the revolution and the people. Therefore, we suggest that Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress be revoked, and we demand that Hu Feng, this counter-revolutionary element, be severely punished according to law.

Letter from Shao Sen and Lingshi, Huzhou Middle School, Zhejiang Province: We are students. Although we do not understand the profound theories of politics and literature, we at least know what is good and what is bad. We can at least clearly understand who our friends are and who our enemies are. We often talk about every true writer with admiration. But when we mention Hu Feng, we gnash our teeth, and we feel incomparable hatred and anger. Because he is our enemy!

Hu Feng spent a lot of time weaving a coat for himself that he thought could cover him up—"My Self-Criticism." He thought he could cover up his tail, thought he could cover up his hideous face. However, the evidence is as solid as a mountain, no matter how cunning an old fox he is, he cannot escape the sharp eyes of the people.

We watched with great patience the materials exposed by the "People's Daily" about the Hu Feng anti-Party group. From these materials, we smelled a gloomy, bloody smell like that of a fascist's secret service agency. Our patience has reached its maximum limit, and we will thoroughly smash all the conspiracies and tricks of Hu Feng and his group!

Letter from Huang Bixuan, No. 4 Zhengjue Temple, Beijing: I am a meteorological worker. After reading the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group" published in the "People's Daily" on May 24, I could no longer suppress my increasing anger towards Hu Feng for many days. I fully agree to immediately revoke all the positions held by Hu Feng in our literary and art circles, and fully agree to revoke Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress through legal procedures.

From dozens of secret letters from Hu Feng to his anti-Party members, it can be seen that Hu Feng's image can only be found among the chief culprits of counter-revolution, and the methods they use can only be found among secret agents, hooligans, and spies. Therefore, I believe that Hu Feng's true face should be thoroughly clarified, and the political background of all their conspiratorial activities should be resolutely clarified. Hu Feng's secret letters are evasive, and he must have more cunning "tactics" than these coded secret letters, and he should be urged to confess to the people as soon as possible.

It should not be assumed that the Hu Feng anti-Party group is only using "pen" as a weapon to launch a rampant attack on us. From his secret letters, we can fully see that Hu Feng's consistent anti-Party and anti-people activities are aimed at subverting the revolutionary regime and destroying our construction undertakings.

Hu Feng wants us to know that "people in the world cannot be deceived completely," but we want Hu Feng to know that the people are even more uninsultable. I think it is now necessary to submit Hu Feng's anti-Party materials to the People's Procuratorate for research. We cannot let this wolf continue to use deception and fraud. For more than 20 years, Hu Feng has regarded us as "enemies." Today, we should not be overly "tolerant" of him. We demand severe punishment of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.

Letter from Dong Defang, Electric Machinery Knitting Factory, Baoding City, Hebei Province: I am a worker in charge of cultural education, and also a young man who loves literature and art. The materials of the Hu Feng anti-Party group exposed in the "People's Daily" aroused my great anger. These materials fully prove that Hu Feng is carrying out anti-Party and anti-people conspiratorial activities in an organized and planned way. This kind of criminal behavior is intolerable. The resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association is completely correct. In addition to supporting this resolution, I also request the People's Government to deal with the Hu Feng anti-Party group according to law. We must thoroughly expose and smash the conspiratorial activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party group so that our people's regime will be more consolidated.

Letter from Zhang Ruiting and two others, Kaifeng Vegetable Oil Factory, Henan Province: After reading the first and second batches of materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party group and some articles criticizing Hu Feng, we felt great anger. Through these materials, we are convinced that Hu Feng is a criminal element who is anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary. He and his group, wearing the cloak of Marxism, have been engaging in criminal activities for 20 years, destroying the Party's literary and artistic undertakings. Now that his disguise has been stripped off, and his conspiracy and ugly face have been completely exposed, this is a great victory for the Party and the people. We fully support the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on the handling of Hu Feng.

Hu Feng Members Must Confess Honestly to the Party and the People

Letter from Shen Shu, Han Chao, Ji Yun and 25 other members of the Chinese People's Volunteers: We are a group of propaganda and cultural workers from various units of the Chinese People's Volunteers who came to Beijing on official business. After reading the two batches of materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party group exposed in the "People's Daily," we could hardly suppress the anger in our hearts.

The people of the whole country love the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, which leads us to achieve such great victories today. But Hu Feng hates our Party so much, viciously calling the literary and art front led by our Party a "literary world ruled by zombies." He wants to "use Sun Wukong to drill into the stomach" tactics to destroy our literary and artistic undertakings and even the revolutionary cause.

When we were fighting bloody battles against the invading troops of American imperialism in Korea, Hu Feng and his reactionary group were frantically doing anti-Party and anti-people deeds in the motherland. In Korea, American imperialism launched "strangulation warfare" and "bacteriological warfare" against us, while in the motherland, Hu Feng launched "heart-digging warfare" and "nerve warfare" against us. Hu Feng wanted to use "cluster grenades" to deal with us. Hu Feng and American imperialism have the same goal, which is to strangle the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and help the counter-revolutionary regime to restore.

In the past, we welcomed Lu Ling, one of Hu Feng's members who wore the cloak of revolution, to Korea, thinking that it was a gratifying thing for him to experience life in our troops. We treated him like a relative, provided him with all the convenient conditions in work, and looked forward to him writing excellent works with enthusiasm. The facts are completely opposite. It turned out that he went to Korea not voluntarily and enthusiastically to experience the noble qualities and feelings of the volunteer soldiers, not to participate in the struggle against American imperialism, but to take the opportunity to "cultivate his spirit" so that he could "fight more" against the Party and the people. Today, we understand why Lu Ling slandered the discipline of our revolutionary army and distorted the heroic image of our volunteer soldiers in his works. It turned out that Hu Feng and his reactionary group had their own "cause" and their own "greater future." Their theories and works serve their reactionary conspiracies.

Thank our Party newspaper for brightening our eyes. We have seen clearly the naked anti-Party and anti-people true face of Hu Feng. Hu Feng's "My Self-Criticism" is full of thorough lies. We have encountered some enemies who feigned surrender on the Korean front. They waved white flags in their hands and walked towards us. When we approached them, they shamelessly fired at us. Hu Feng's "Self-Criticism" is the white flag of feigned surrender.

For such a reactionary and incorrigible Hu Feng, we cannot tolerate him any longer. Therefore, we fully support the five resolutions of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association. At the same time, we also suggest that the relevant authorities should continue to urge Hu Feng's members to make a thorough confession and confess their crimes to the Party and the people; the Party organizations of the relevant authorities should conduct strict reviews of Party members who participated in the Hu Feng group and give them Party disciplinary actions. Any Hu Feng member who dares to refuse to confess and resists to the end should be dealt with according to law.

Letter from Wang Jinsheng, Preparatory Committee of the China First Machinery Trade Union, Locomotive and Rolling Stock Working Committee: I am a trade union cadre from a worker background. I finished reading the "Second Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Anti-Party Group" with unparalleled anger. These materials clearly show what kind of person Hu Feng is. Hu Feng is not only not worthy of being called a writer, but also not worthy of being called a Chinese. He is a counter-revolutionary conspirator mixed in the ranks of the people, and a loyal running dog of the reactionary bourgeoisie. I suggest that Hu Feng be immediately purged from all our organizations and not be allowed to continue to defile the glorious title of deputy to the National People's Congress. We must continue to thoroughly investigate all the conspiracies of the Hu Feng anti-Party group.

When I read the first batch of anti-Party materials of Hu Feng, I thought it was the past materials; after reading the second batch of materials, I fully understood that Hu Feng was a leader of a counter-revolutionary group who had been mixed in the revolutionary ranks for a long time, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities with purpose, plan, and organization.

The Hu Feng anti-Party group and all members with the same conspiracy should know that today, the people under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party are not to be deceived, and any anti-Party and anti-people group will be thoroughly crushed by the people.

Letter from Li Zhihua, Zhao Xun and 19 other members of the Script Creation Office of the China Dramatists Association: The criminal activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party group have been exposed to the people. The "secret letters" full of murderous intent clearly reveal Hu Feng's deep hatred for the Party and the people. They are always peeking at revolutionary work with thief-like eyes, and they will destroy it whenever they have the opportunity. When we criticized the mistakes of the "Literary Gazette" in order to improve our work, they were so ecstatic that they went crazy, saying that "the gap has been opened" and "it looks good enough." They used despicable means to steal Party documents, saying that these documents were "very useful" to them. Are not all these behaviors the same as those adopted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang? As the editor's note of the "People's Daily" pointed out, the Hu Feng anti-Party group "places its hope on the restoration of the counter-revolutionary regime and the collapse of the people's revolutionary regime."

We cannot tolerate Hu Feng, the chief culprit of counter-revolution, raging on. In order to purify our front and safeguard the interests of the people, we demand that Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress be immediately revoked and continue to investigate his counter-revolutionary criminal activities. He is an enemy of the Chinese people. He cannot enjoy any rights of the Chinese people.

The members of the Hu Feng anti-Party group must confess thoroughly to the people; whoever stubbornly opposes the people will reap the consequences, and conspiracy and disguise cannot save you.

Letter from Sun Jie and Li Guo, Fengjie Military Service Bureau, Sichuan Province: We are young soldiers. After reading the materials about Hu Feng recently published in the newspapers, we have a clear understanding of "Hu Feng," the cunning old fellow who is engaging in sabotage in the revolutionary camp under the guise of revolution. All his activities make every conscientious young man who loves the motherland feel incomparable resentment. We will never tolerate his criminal behavior. We must resolutely give a fatal blow. We express to the Party: We resolutely support this struggle led by the Party and congratulate the victory of the struggle with full confidence. At the same time, we must warn the Hu Feng group members: Our Party is a long-tested, wise and great vanguard of the Chinese working class, a strong fortress that no reactionary force can destroy. Even the mad dogs of imperialism armed to the teeth are afraid of such a powerful force. How much ability does Hu Feng have to dare to continue to resist stubbornly. Surrender quickly!

Long-distance telephone from Hanzhong Newspaper, Shaanxi Province: All the staff of our Hanzhong Newspaper want to resolutely and thoroughly smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group together with the people of the whole country.

Hu Feng, the wolf in sheep's clothing, did not deceive the sharp eyes of the Party and the people after all. His conspiracy was finally discovered. We demand that Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress be revoked quickly and severely punished according to law.

Tell Hu Feng that the People's Republic of China is the people's own country, and the regime belongs to the people. All eight million Chiang Kai-shek bandits were wiped out by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Your attempt to smash the people's "iron wall" with your "head" is completely a dream. Honestly confess your master and await the judgment of the people!

Raise Vigilance to Defend the Socialist Revolution

Letter from Xue Gongwei, Tongliao County Health Center, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: I am a doctor. After reading the two batches of materials of the Hu Feng anti-Party group, I felt great anger. From these materials, we can clearly see the conspiratorial activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party group. Hu Feng eats the people's food and wears the people's cloth. But he is doing anti-Party and anti-people deeds. How shameful and despicable this is! The extremely sinful Hu Feng is full of reactionary thoughts, and Hu Feng's blood is also poisonous. As a citizen of the People's Republic of China, I demand that the government give Hu Feng severe legal sanctions, and we are determined to eliminate the Hu Feng anti-Party group.

From the exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party group incident, our medical departments must also draw experience and lessons, raise vigilance, and defend our great socialist revolutionary cause.

Letter from Zou Jiaming, Health Station of the Fourth Tunnel Team, Tunnel Engineering Company of the Ministry of Railways: I am a medical worker participating in the construction of the Baocheng Line. Hu Feng's 20 years of anti-Party and anti-people conspiratorial activities made me feel extremely resentful. The two batches of materials disclosed in the newspapers are the most powerful ironclad evidence, which made me clearly realize Hu Feng's true face. It turned out that Hu Feng was not a "writer" at all, but a bloodless killer mixed in the revolutionary ranks. Hu Feng "smiles with contempt" and "shakes hands and talks happily" with revolutionaries, but secretly uses a "whip with a rubber-covered steel wire to beat prisoners," which is absolutely intolerable.

For 20 years, the Party has been caring for him and uniting him, but Hu Feng has acted against his conscience and done bad things. After his reactionary thoughts were criticized, Hu Feng not only did not bow his head to the people and honestly confess his problems, but also tried his best to write his fake review, trying to deceive the people. We neither believe this kind of nonsense nor will we be deceived by this kind of deception anymore. Hu Feng's bloodless conspiracy has been seen through by the Party and the people. We must thoroughly smash this counter-revolutionary group, and we must always be vigilant to prevent all hidden enemies from undermining our revolutionary cause.

Letter from Zhou Huasheng, No. 18 North Fourth Malu, Taiyuan Street, Heping District, Shenyang City, Liaoning Province: I am a cleaner. The materials on the Hu Feng anti-Party group published in the "People's Daily" stung my heart and aroused my anger and hatred.

Hu Feng has deceived us for more than 20 years. He spread poison in newspapers and books to anesthetize our thoughts, and he even dared to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, instructing his lackeys to infiltrate revolutionary agencies and organizations, steal Party documents, inquire about the situation, establish "strongholds," and expand "strength." Do not touch the open ones, but secretly accelerate "sharpening my sword, spying on the direction, when I am sure, I am willing to cut off my head and throw it out." If Hu Feng was standing in front of me, I would really raise my hand and break his head.

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, Hu Feng was exposed. We must deeply accept this lesson, raise our vigilance anytime and anywhere, and fight to the end to thoroughly eliminate and expose the conspiratorial activities of all counter-revolutionary elements.

I suggest that Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress be revoked. I suggest that the government impose severe legal sanctions on Hu Feng.

Letter from Kang Zhihua and Xiao Chunfu, Second Branch of the Hebei Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School: We are educators working in the Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School. After the "People's Daily" exposed Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary materials twice, we suddenly realized that Hu Feng was a class enemy who extremely hated the Party, hated the people, and hated the revolution.

The Hu Feng group is a counter-revolutionary organization, and this pile of stinky garbage must be swept out.

Through this incident, we further realized that the class struggle during the period of socialist construction is more profound and extensive than the past struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. At the same time, the means adopted by class enemies are more diversified. They try everything to infiltrate our interior and destroy the cause of our Party and the people. We must raise our vigilance and eliminate the hidden counter-revolutionary elements around us.

Letter from Guo Shaoyu, Nursery of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, Sichuan Province: I am a childcare worker. The materials of the Hu Feng anti-Party group published in the newspapers aroused my anger and made me realize that Hu Feng is not just a person with ideological problems, but a conspirator who has consistently engaged in anti-Party and anti-people activities. We know that as long as the enemy exists for one day, we will not have a peaceful day. The enemy Hu Feng said: "Let them know that the world is not easy to be 'peaceful'." Therefore, we should learn a lesson from the criminal activities of the Hu Feng anti-Party group and deeply realize that the enemy is everywhere, just as Hu Feng himself said, to "use Sun Wukong to drill into the stomach tactics," but this is only one of the enemy's tactics.

At a time when the people of the whole country are actively fighting for the liberation of Taiwan and working hard to realize the first five-year plan, we do not allow any enemy to sabotage. I firmly demand that Hu Feng be punished by law.

Letter from Fan Junhong, Wang Xizhu and 13 other members of the Literature Group of the China Peking Opera Theater: We are staff members of the China Peking Opera Theater. Recently, we read two batches of materials exposing the crimes of the Hu Feng anti-Party group, and we clearly realized that what they are carrying out is not a debate on literary and artistic ideas, but an organized and planned opposition to the revolution, an attempt to overthrow the Party's leadership over the revolution, and a conspiratorial activity to subvert the revolution from within. These materials fully show that they are not only our ideological enemies, but also our political irreconcilable enemies!

For more than 20 years, the Hu Feng anti-Party group has been wearing the cloak of Marxism, wearing a "promotion" face, mixing into our revolutionary literary and art ranks, expanding the organization in an organized and planned way, establishing strongholds, constantly spying on intelligence, studying strategies, and changing tactics; not hesitating to use all kinds of cunning and vicious conspiratorial means in order to achieve their anti-Party, anti-people subversive revolutionary goals.

We should draw experience and lessons from this incident. The Hu Feng anti-Party group has been mixed in the revolutionary literary and art camp for more than 20 years, and his followers have infiltrated the Party's organization and implemented the "Sun Wukong drilling into the stomach tactics," but we have not discovered it for a long time. It was not until the Party exposed it again and again that we gradually realized the truth of this criminal anti-Party group. This fully shows that we are too paralyzed and careless about the conspiracies and tricks of class enemies, and our vigilance is not enough.

In the process of socialist construction, our enemies will use even more despicable, more shameless, and more hidden means to undermine our cause. We must raise our vigilance and be prepared to give the enemy a thorough and devastating blow at any time!

Letter from Wu Boxiao, Zhang Bi, Chen Bochui and 36 other members of the People's Education Publishing House: We are editors of the Chinese language textbook and "Chinese Language Learning" of the People's Education Publishing House, and we feel great anger at the Hu Feng and Hu Feng group's anti-Party and anti-people criminal activities. Hu Feng and the Hu Feng group have long been carrying the banner of revolution, infiltrating the Communist Party, troops, agencies, and organizations, and using various insidious and vicious means to undermine the literary and artistic movement and the entire revolutionary cause led by the Party. Hu Feng is a public enemy of the Chinese people. If we do not raise our vigilance, thoroughly expose his counter-revolutionary crimes, remove him from the revolutionary ranks, punish him according to law, and thoroughly smash his anti-Party group, it will cause serious damage to the cause of socialist construction.

Therefore, we unanimously support the resolution of the joint meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association. We request that Hu Feng's qualifications as a deputy to the National People's Congress be revoked, and we request the Supreme People's Procuratorate to take necessary action on Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes.

The serious ideological and political struggle against the Hu Feng group has once again carried out profound ideological and political education for the whole Party and the people of the whole country, making the whole Party and the people of the whole country greatly improve ideologically and politically.

专栏：

    坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    一定要追查胡风集团的政治背景
    中国人民解放军战士孟广山来信：胡风反党集团的罪恶事实被揭发后，海防战士无不咬牙切齿，恨之入骨。胡风这个潜伏在我们队伍里的反革命罪魁，不仅在革命进行得正艰苦的时期调兵遣将以“实力”对付我们，而且在全国解放以后，当六亿人民坚如磐石地团结在党和毛主席的周围满怀信心进行社会主义建设的时候，他还更积极地配合了帝国主义对我党实行内外夹攻，这是多么恶毒和无耻！
    解放初期，胡风趁着我们的党正在忙于经济恢复工作的时候，他就加紧了复辟的组织活动，制定了一个完整的反党的组织纲领。除了蒋介石、帝国主义和反革命分子外，谁还有这么大的决心来反党反人民？蒋介石在台湾不就吹过“一年准备，二年反攻，三年扫荡，五年成功”的牛皮吗？这和胡风的话有什么区别呢？反党罪魁胡风“不到黄河心不死”地坚决同党和人民为敌到底，他的“远大的未来”和美帝国主义特务天天等待的“未来”是没有两样的。
    我们警告胡风和跟着胡风的人：我们有党和毛主席的坚强领导，我们有强大的现代化的国防军，你们所期待的蒋介石的复辟，永远只能是一个梦想。
    中共河北省张家口地委基点工作组徐守常、张守恩来信：我们是农村工作人员。起初，我们错误地认为胡风向党中央提出的“意见书”仅仅是文艺思想问题，并且天真地想：胡风闲暇无聊，与其写十多万字的“意见书”，不如用这点功夫为青年写一部好小说呢。后来，看到了“人民日报”连续揭发的关于胡风反党集团的两批材料后，我们才清醒了。原来胡风是个彻头彻尾的反党、反人民、反革命的分子。他恶毒地污蔑党的文艺方针、污蔑党的负责同志，咒骂文艺界的党员作家和一切进步作家。他处心积虑地扩充“实力”，组织反党集团，向党所领导的文艺战线猖狂进攻。表面上他是顺着党和人民，暗中却加紧“磨我的剑，窥测方向”，进行反革命活动。他唆使他的反党集团分子打进党内、打进革命团体内建立据点，用卑鄙无耻的手段盗窃党内文件。他鼓励他的集团分子“在忍受中求得重生”、把希望寄托在反革命政权的复辟上。由此看来，胡风这个反革命家伙已经是死心塌地与革命、人民为敌。因此我们建议撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并要求严肃地依法处理胡风这个反革命分子。
    浙江省湖州中学少森、灵石来信：我们是学生。我们虽还不懂得政治、文学的高深理论，可是我们至少知道什么是好的，什么是坏的。我们至少能清楚地明白谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人。我们常常以敬佩的心情来谈论每一位真正的作家。可是我们一提起胡风，便会咬牙切齿，便会感到无比的憎恨和愤怒。因为他是我们的敌人！
    胡风费了好多时间替自己织了一件自以为能遮得住自己的外套——“我的自我批判”。他自以为能罩得住自己的尾巴了，自以为能遮住他那狰狞的面目了。可是，铁证如山，任他是怎样的一只老奸巨猾的狐狸也逃不过人民雪亮的眼睛。
    我们以极大的忍耐看完了“人民日报”所揭发的关于胡风反党集团的材料，从这些材料里我们闻到了像法西斯主义者的特务机关那样阴森森的血腥气味。我们的忍耐已经达到了最大的限度，我们要彻底粉碎胡风及其集团的一切阴谋诡计！
    北京市正觉寺四号黄必选来信：我是一个气象工作者。读了五月二十四日“人民日报”发表的
  “关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”后，更加抑止不住我多天来对胡风的日益增加的愤怒情绪。我完全同意立即撤销胡风在我们文艺界所担负的一切职务，完全同意经过法定手续撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格。
    从胡风给他的反党分子的几十封密信中可以看出：胡风的形象是只能在反革命首恶分子中才能找到，而他们所使用的手段，也是只有在特务、流氓、间谍分子那里才能找到的。因此我认为应当彻底弄清胡风的真面目，坚决把他们的一切阴谋活动的政治背景弄清楚。胡风的密信是躲躲闪闪的，他一定还有比这些密信隐语更狡猾的“战术”，应该赶紧要他向人民交代。
    不能认为胡风反党集团仅仅只是用“笔杆”为武器向我们作猖狂的进攻的。从他的密信中，我们完全可以看出胡风一贯的反党、反人民的活动，是想颠覆革命政权，破坏我们的建设事业的。
    胡风要使我们知道“世上人不能尽欺”，但我们要使胡风知道人民更是不可轻侮的。我认为现在已有必要把胡风的反党材料提交人民检察机关研究，我们不能让这只恶狼再施行欺骗诈术。二十多年来，胡风把我们当“敌人”看待，今天我们不应当对他过份“容忍”，我们要求严惩胡风反革命集团。
    河北省保定市电机针织厂董德芳来信：我是一个职工文化教育工作者，也是一个爱好文艺的青年。“人民日报”上所揭露出的胡风反党集团的材料，激起了我极大的愤怒。这些材料充分证明了胡风是有组织、有计划地进行反党反人民的阴谋活动。这种罪恶行为是不能令人容忍的。中国文联主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议是完全正确的。我除拥护这一决议外，并要求人民政府依法处理胡风反党集团。我们要彻底揭露粉碎胡风反党集团的阴谋活动，使我们的人民政权更加巩固。
    河南省开封市植物油厂张瑞庭等三人来信：我们看了关于胡风反党集团的第一、第二两批材料和其他一些批判胡风的文章以后，我们感到很大的愤怒。通过这些材料，我们确切地认识到胡风是一个反党反人民反革命的罪恶分子。他和他的集团披着马克思主义的外衣，二十年来处心积虑进行罪恶活动，破坏党的文艺事业，现在被剥去了伪装，彻底暴露了他的阴谋丑恶面目，这是党和人民的一次大胜利。我们完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议对胡风处理的决议。
    胡风分子必须向党和人民坦白交代
    中国人民志愿军申述、韩潮、纪云等二十五人来信：我们是一群因公来北京的中国人民志愿军各部队的宣传文化工作人员。我们看了“人民日报”揭露的关于胡风反党集团的两批材料后，简直不能抑制住我们内心的愤怒。
    全国人民都热爱领导着我们取得今天这样伟大胜利的伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党。而胡风却如此仇视我们的党，恶毒地称我们党所领导的文艺战线是“僵尸统治的文坛”。他要“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，来破坏我们的文艺事业以至革命事业。
    当我们在朝鲜同美帝国主义的侵略军队浴血苦战的时候，胡风及其反动集团却在祖国疯狂地干着反党反人民的勾当。在朝鲜，美国帝国主义曾对我们开展了“绞杀战”、“细菌战”，而在祖国，胡风则对我们开展了“挖心战”、“神经战”。胡风要用“集束手榴弹”来对付我们。胡风和美帝国主义的目的是一致的，就是想扼杀中国人民的革命事业，帮助反革命政权复辟。
    过去，我们曾欢迎过披着革命外衣的胡风分子之一路翎到朝鲜来，认为他到我们部队中体验生活是一件可喜的事情，我们像接待亲人似地招待他，在工作上给他一切方便的条件，并且用热烈的心情期待着他写出优秀的作品。事实完全相反，原来他到朝鲜去，并不是自愿地满怀热情地去体会志愿军战士们的高贵品质和感情，并不是参加对美帝国主义的斗争，而是借机
  “养得精神”，以便对党对人民“更能斗争”。今天，我们才明白了，在路翎的作品里，为什么污蔑我们革命军队的纪律，为什么歪曲我们志愿军战士的英雄形象，原来胡风及其反动集团有他们自己的“事业”，有他们自己的“更远大的未来”，他们的理论和作品是为他们的反动阴谋服务的。
    感谢我们的党报把我们的眼睛擦亮了。我们已看清了胡风的赤裸裸的反党反人民的真面目。胡风的“我的自我批判”满篇都是彻头彻尾的谎言。我们在朝鲜前线曾遇到过一些诈降的敌人，他们手里摇着小白旗向我们走来，当我们走近他们的时候，他们就无耻地向我们狠狠地开枪。胡风的“自我批判”就是诈降的小白旗。
    对于这样反动透顶、怙恶不悛的胡风，是不能再姑息容忍下去了。因此，我们完全拥护中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的五项决议，同时，我们还要建议有关机关应该继续促使胡风分子作彻底交代，向党和人民坦白认罪；各有关机关的党组织，应该对参加胡风集团的党员作严格的审查，并予以党纪处分。任何一个胡风分子如果胆敢拒不坦白、顽抗到底，那就应该依法处理。
    中国第一机械工会筹备委员会机车车辆工作委员会王金生来信：我是一个工人出身的工会干部。我怀着无比的愤怒，读完了“关于胡风反党集团的第二批材料”。这些材料十分明白地说明了胡风是一个什么样的人。胡风不但不配称为一个作家，也不配称为一个中国人。他是混在人民队伍中的一个反革命的阴谋家，反动的资产阶级的忠实走狗。我建议立刻把胡风从我们一切组织中清洗出去，不能让他继续玷污全国人民代表大会代表的光荣称号。我们要继续彻底追查胡风反党集团的一切阴谋。
    当我读了胡风反党的第一批材料时，我还以为是过去的材料；读了第二批材料，我全都明白了，原来胡风是一个长期混在革命队伍中，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，有目的、有计划、有组织地从事反革命活动的反革命集团的头子。
    胡风反党集团和一切怀着同样阴谋的分子，应当晓得，今天，在伟大的中国共产党领导下的人民是不可欺的，任何反党反人民的集团都要遭到人民彻底的粉碎。
    中国戏剧家协会剧本创作室李之华、赵寻等十九人来信：胡风反党集团的罪恶活动已经暴露在人民面前了。那些充满杀气的“密信”里十分明显地表露着胡风对党对人民的深仇大恨。他们对革命工作时时都在贼眉鼠眼地窥伺着，一有机会便来破坏。当我们为了改进工作，批评“文艺报”的错误时，他们简直狂喜到发疯的程度，说是“缺口已打开了”“够好看的”。他们使用卑鄙的手段盗窃党的文件，说这些文件对他们“很有用”。所有这些行为不正是蒋介石匪帮所要采取的行为吗？正如“人民日报”编者按语所指出的，胡风反党集团“是把希望寄托在反革命政权的复辟和人民革命政权的倒台的”。
    我们不能容忍胡风这个反革命的首恶分子猖獗下去，为了纯洁我们的阵线，保卫人民的利益，我们要求立即撤销胡风全国人民代表大会的代表资格，继续追查他的反革命的罪恶活动。他是中国人民的敌人。他不能享受中国人民的任何权利。
    胡风反党集团的分子们，必须彻底向人民交代；谁要死硬地与人民为敌，谁将自食其果，阴谋和伪装是拯救不了你们的。
    四川省奉节兵役局孙洁、李果来信：我们是年青的战士，读了最近报纸上刊登的有关胡风的材料，对“胡风”这个老奸巨猾打着革命的招牌，混在革命阵营中从事破坏的反动分子有了清楚的认识。他的一切活动，使我们每一个有良心的热爱祖国的青年感到无比的愤恨。他的罪恶行为，我们决不能容忍。我们要坚决给予致命的打击。我们向党表示：坚决支持党领导的这一斗争，并充满信心地祝贺斗争的胜利。同时要警告胡风集团分子；我们党是久经考验的英明伟大的中国工人阶级的先锋队，是任何反动势力摧毁不垮的坚强堡垒，帝国主义武装到牙齿的疯狗们，尚且惧怕这样强大的力量，胡风能有多大的本领敢于继续顽抗。赶快投降吧！
    陕西省汉中报社长途电话：我们汉中报社的全体职工，要同全国人民一道坚决彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团。
    胡风这只披着羊皮的狼，到底没有瞒过党和人民的雪亮的眼睛。他的阴谋终于被发现了。我们要求迅速地把胡风全国人民代表大会的代表资格取消，并依法严惩。
    告诉胡风，中华人民共和国是人民自己的国家，政权是属于人民的。八百万蒋贼军全叫中国人民解放军消灭了，你妄想用你的“头颅”来击碎人民的“铁壁”，那完全是梦想。老老实实地供出你的主子吧，听候人民的裁判吧！
    提高警惕保卫社会主义革命事业
    内蒙古自治区通辽县卫生院薛公维来信：我是一个医生。读了胡风反党集团的两批材料以后，我感到极大愤怒。从这些材料里可以清楚地看到胡风反党集团的阴谋活动。胡风吃的是人民的粮食，穿的是人民的布匹。但是他却干反党反人民的勾当，这是多么可耻，多么卑鄙！罪大恶极的胡风，满脑子是反动思想，胡风的血液也是有毒素的。我以中华人民共和国一个公民的资格，要求政府给胡风以严厉的法律制裁，我们坚决要肃清胡风反党集团。
    从胡风反党集团事件的揭露中，我们医务部门，也必须吸取经验教训，提高警惕，保卫我们伟大的社会主义革命事业。
    铁道部隧道工程公司第四隧道队保健站邹家明来信：我是一个参加宝成线建设的医务工作者。胡风二十年来反党反人民的阴谋活动，使我无比愤恨。报上披露的两批材料是最有力的铁证，使我清楚认识到胡风的本来面目，原来胡风不是什么“作家”，而是混进革命队伍中的杀人不见血的刽子手。胡风“用微笑包着侮蔑”和革命者“握手言欢”，暗中却用“橡皮包着钢丝打囚徒的鞭子”打我们，这是绝不能容忍的。
    二十年来，党一直关心他，团结他，但是胡风却昧着良心作坏事。他的反动思想被批判后，胡风不但不向人民低头，老老实实交代问题，还费尽心机写他的假检讨，企图欺骗人民。我们既不相信这种鬼话也不再受这种欺骗。胡风这种杀人不见血的阴谋诡计，已经被党被人民看穿了。我们要彻底粉碎这个反革命集团，我们要时刻提高警惕，防止一切暗藏敌人来破坏我们的革命事业。
    辽宁省沈阳市和平区太原街北四马路十八号周化生来信：我是一个清扫员。“人民日报”发表的关于胡风反党集团的材料刺痛了我的心，激起了我的愤怒和仇恨。
    胡风欺骗我们二十多年了，他在报刊和书籍里散布毒素，麻醉我们的思想，而且还胆敢进行反革命活动，指使他的走狗混入革命机关、团体内，偷窃党的文件，探听情况、建立“据点”，扩大“实力”。公开的不要碰，而暗中却加紧“磨我的剑，窥测方向，到我看准了的时候，我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去”。假若胡风站在我的跟前，我真会举手打破他的头颅。
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，胡风被揭穿了。我们要深刻地接受这次教训，随时随地提高警惕，为彻底肃清和揭穿一切反革命分子阴谋活动而斗争到底。
    我建议撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格。建议政府对胡风加以严厉的法律制裁。
    河北省革命残废军人学校第二分校康治华、萧春富来信：我们是在革命残废军人学校工作的教育工作者。当“人民日报”两次揭发胡风的反革命材料以后，使我们恍然大悟，认识到胡风是一个极端仇恨党、仇恨人民、仇恨革命的阶级敌人。
    胡风集团是一个反革命的组织，必须把这一堆臭气冲天的垃圾扫出去。
    通过这事件，使我们进一步认识到在社会主义建设时期阶级斗争比过去反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争更加深刻和广泛了。同时阶级敌人所采用的手段更多样化了。他们想尽一切办法打入我们内部、破坏我们党和人民的事业。我们必须提高警惕，肃清我们周围的暗藏的反革命分子。
    四川省重庆市商业局托儿所郭绍虞来信：我是一个保育工作者。报上公布的胡风反党集团的材料激起了我的愤怒，使我认识了胡风不只是有思想问题的人，而且是一个一贯反党反人民的阴谋活动者。我们知道，敌人存在一天，我们就不会有安静的一天。敌人胡风说：“使他们知道天下不容易‘太平’”。因此，我们应该从胡风反党集团罪恶活动这一事实中得到教训，深刻地体会到敌人是无孔不入的，正如胡风自己所说的，要“用孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，而这不过是敌人的战术之一。
    正当我们全国人民积极地为解放台湾而斗争，为实现第一个五年计划而努力的时候，我们不容许任何敌人的破坏，我坚决要求给胡风以法律制裁。
    中国京剧院文学组范钧宏、王颉竹等十三人来信：我们是中国京剧院的工作人员。最近以来，我们读了两批揭发胡风反党集团罪行的材料，清清楚楚地认识了他们所进行的不是什么文艺思想上的争论，而是有组织、有计划的反对革命，企图推翻党对革命的领导，从内部来颠覆革命的阴谋活动。这些材料充分地说明了：他们不仅仅是我们思想上的敌人，而且是我们政治上的势不两立的敌人！
    二十多年来，胡风反党集团披着马克思主义外衣，戴着“加官”脸，混入我们的革命文艺队伍，有组织、有计划地扩大组织，建立据点；不断地刺探情报、研究策略、改变战术；不惜用种种狡猾、凶恶的阴谋手段，以求达到他们的反党、反人民的颠覆革命的目的。
    我们应该从这一事件中取得经验教训。胡风反党集团混入革命文艺阵营二十多年了，而且，他的党羽打入党的组织，实行着“孙行者钻进肚皮去的战术”，而我们竟长期没有发觉，直到党一次又一次地揭发出来，我们才逐渐认清了这个罪恶的反党集团的真相。这就充分说明我们对于阶级敌人的阴谋诡计是过于麻痹大意，警惕性太不够了。
    在社会主义建设的过程中，我们的敌人还会用更卑鄙、更无耻、更隐蔽的手段来破坏我们的事业，我们必须提高警惕，准备随时给敌人以彻底的、毁灭性的打击！
    人民教育出版社吴伯箫、张毕来、陈伯吹等三十六人来信：我们是人民教育出版社语文课本和
  “语文学习”的编辑工作者，对胡风和胡风集团反党反人民的罪恶活动，感到极大的愤怒。胡风和胡风集团长期以来打着革命的招牌，打入共产党、部队、机关、团体，以种种阴险毒辣的手段破坏党所领导的文艺运动和整个革命事业。胡风是中国人民的公敌，如果我们不提高警惕，彻底揭露他的反革命罪行，把他从革命队伍里清除出去，根据法律加以制裁，并且彻底粉碎他的反党集团，那就会给社会主义建设事业造成严重的损害。
    因此，我们一致拥护中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，我们要求撤销胡风全国人民代表大会代表的资格，要求最高人民检察院对胡风的反革命罪行进行必要的处理。
    对胡风集团的严重的思想斗争和政治斗争，又一次对全党和全国人民进行了深刻的思想政治教育，使全党和全国人民在思想上和政治上大大提高了一步。（附图片）
