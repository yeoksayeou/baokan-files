To the Editor:

The reconstruction of the Liu Shan Inclined Shaft is a major part of the overall reconstruction of Fushun. The Liu Shan Engineering Office of the Fushun Mining Bureau (hereinafter referred to as Party A) is fully responsible for the reconstruction of the Liu Shan Inclined Shaft; the Northeast Coal Mine Design Institute in Shenyang (hereinafter referred to as the Design Institute) is responsible for the entire project design; and the Fushun Mining Bureau Civil Engineering Company (hereinafter referred to as Party B) is responsible for the civil construction. This project is very arduous, and these three units need to strengthen cooperation to complete the task. To achieve this, both the Design Institute and Party A have representatives stationed at the construction site. However, at present, some of these representatives are not only unable to discover and solve problems at any time, but have become "imperial envoys" on the construction site.

Ma Qi, the special representative of the Design Institute stationed at the construction site, should have a lot of work to do. This is because the Design Institute is full of errors and problems, which seriously affect the smooth progress of the construction. For example, the auxiliary hoisting rear car room has a construction area of only 84 square meters, but the construction department found 27 problems after review. Many designs have been changed repeatedly. The design of the east exhaust substation has been changed 89 times, the joint welfare administrative building has been changed 36 times before construction, and the design of the regional substation has been recalled and reworked with 12 drawings due to calculation errors, which has thrown the construction budget and material preparation into chaos. In many designs, the sum of the dimensions does not equal the total dimension, and the design of the same project is different in several drawings, which makes the construction department at a loss. The design of doors and windows does not take into account the standard sizes commonly used by the supply department, and many need to be custom-made, which increases the cost. In some projects, the old and new mortar grades are used interchangeably, which increases the difficulty for the construction department. In addition, most of the design drawings are incomplete and not comprehensive, and the supply is neither timely nor very chaotic. Among the more than ten pieces of engineering drawings that have arrived, none have construction instructions; civil engineering and auxiliary water, electricity, and heating projects are carried out simultaneously, but none of the Design Institute's drawings have arrived for civil engineering and water, electricity, and heating at the same time; even the drawings of doors, windows, and door and window lintels, which originally had standard drawings, cannot arrive on time. The Design Institute also sent many blank drawings, with no cover text or any drawings, only a large stamp and many signatures of "chiefs," which confused the construction site. The drawings of the underground culvert that Party B urgently needs for construction were mistakenly sent to the irrelevant Transportation Department of the Fushun Mining Bureau; while the joint welfare administrative building, which originally had no picture rail, was attached with a picture rail detail drawing. In the projects to be started in April and May, the industrial square drainage ditch, sewer, chimney, east exhaust earthwork, material warehouse, and cement warehouse, etc., did not even have a shadow of the drawings by the end of April.

How did the special representative of the Design Institute deal with these problems? He rarely went deep into the construction site to contact workers and technicians, but said: "My office is in the Liu Shan Engineering Office. You can come to the Liu Shan Engineering Office to find me if you have any questions." However, once a technician at the construction site was preparing a construction budget, and because there were many problems in the drawings, he went to find Ma Qi. But he said impatiently: "Don't you have a superior? What qualifications do you have to come to me? If you have any questions, you should submit them to your superior, who will transfer them to the company, who will summarize them and submit them to the Liu Shan Engineering Office, and the Engineering Office will uniformly submit them to the Design Institute. The Design Institute is only responsible to the Liu Shan Engineering Office, not to the Civil Engineering Company." Another time, someone suggested shortening the journey of the documents because the Design Institute's drawing issuing procedures were cumbersome and had to go through many agencies that did not review the drawings at all. Ma Qi's reply was: "This requires the Mining Bureau to make a request to the Design Bureau, it is not something you can say will work!" As for the problems and errors in the design that seriously hindered the progress of the construction, Ma Qi considered them all to be minor problems. He had two shields: one was evasive words such as "still needs to be studied and decided," "still needs to be replied to by the institute," and "detail drawings will be supplemented later," but he neither decided nor replied afterward, let alone supplemented the drawings; the other was to emphasize the low technical level, but in fact, problems such as dimensional errors are a matter of responsibility to the country, not a technical issue.

The work style of some representatives of the Liu Shan Engineering Office is also problematic. When handling design change procedures, they always do not follow the national contract regulations to handle engineering change certificates, but directly write orders and issue instructions to the work sections, without going through the company or the competent department of the construction site. The attitude of individual representatives towards the workers is very bad.

I suggest that the relevant units should check the work style of these representatives, and ask them to put down the airs of "imperial envoys" and solve some practical problems in the work for the construction units.

### 抚顺工地上的“钦差大臣”

    抚顺工地上的“钦差大臣”编辑同志：
    刘山斜井改建工程是抚顺整体改造中的一个主要部分。对刘山斜井改建工程负整个责任的是抚顺矿务局刘山工程处（以下简称甲方）；负责整个工程设计的是沈阳东北煤矿设计院（以下简称设计院）；负责土建工程施工的是抚顺矿务局土建公司
  （以下简称乙方）。这项工程任务很繁重，需要这三个单位加强协作，才能完成这个任务。为了做到这一点，设计院和甲方都派有代表驻在工地。但是目前，这些代表中有一部分同志不但不能做到随时发现问题、解决问题，而且成为工地上的“钦差大臣”。
    住在工地的设计院特派代表马琦本来应该有很多工作要做，这是因为设计院的错误百出，问题很多，严重影响了施工的顺利进行。例如，辅助提升后车房这个工程建筑面积只八十四平方公尺，但经过施工部门审查就有问题二十七项。很多设计一再变更，东排气变电所设计变更了八十九次，联合福利行政大楼未开工前变更了三十六项，区域变电所的设计因计算错误而有十二张图纸收回返工，这就使施工预算和材料准备陷于混乱状态。很多设计中分尺寸加起来老是不等于总尺寸，同一工程的设计在几张图样中不一样的情况也很多，这就使施工部门无所适从。设计门窗不考虑供应部门习用的成材规格，很多需要特制，因而提高了成本。有些工程中沙浆标号新旧互用，增加了施工部门的困难。此外，设计图纸大部分是不完整的、不全面的，供应得既不及时，又很混乱。在已经到达的十多件工程图纸中，没有一件是有施工说明书的；土建工程和附属的水电暖工程是同时进行的，但是设计院的图纸却没有一份是土建和水电暖同时到达的；甚至门窗及门窗过梁的图纸本来有现成的标准图的，但也不能按时到达。设计院还曾发来了许多白图，既没有封面字样，也无任何图样，只有一个大戳和许多“长”的签字，把工地弄得莫名其妙。乙方急待施工的地下涵洞的图纸，被错发到毫不相关的抚顺矿务局运输部；而联合福利行政大楼本来没有挂镜线却附来了挂镜线大样。在准备四、五月份开工的工程中，工业广场排水沟、下水道、烟筒、东排气土方、材料仓库和水泥仓库等工程，到四月底为止，连图纸的影子都没有。
    设计院的特派代表是怎样对待这些问题的呢？他很少深入工地同工人和技术人员接触，却说：
  “我的办公室就在刘山工程处，你们有问题可以到刘山工程处来找我。”但是，有一次工地一位技术人员编制施工预算，因为图纸中有许多问题，就去找马琦。他却很不耐烦地说：“你有上级没有？你有什么资格找我？你有问题应提给上级，由上级转给公司，由公司汇总统一提给刘山工程处，由工程处统一提给设计院，设计院只对刘山工程处负责，不对土建公司负责。”另外一次，有人因为设计院发图手续繁琐，要经过很多根本不审查图纸的机关，就建议缩短文件的旅程。马琦的答复是：
  “这需要矿务局向设计局提出请求，不是你一说就行的事！”至于严重阻碍着施工进展的设计中的问题和错误，马琦都认为是小问题。他有两个挡箭牌：一个是“尚须研究决定”“尚须回院答复”
  “大样图后补”等搪塞的话，但是事后既不决定，又不答复，更不补图；另一个是强调技术水平不高，实际上尺寸错误等问题是对国家责任感的问题，而不是技术问题。
    刘山工程处有些代表的工作作风也是有问题的。他们在办理设计变更手续的时候，总是不按国家包工条例，办理工程更改证书，直接向工段写命令、发指示，既不通过公司，又不通过工地主管部门。个别代表对工人的态度很不好。
    我建议有关单位应检查一下这些代表的工作作风，要他们放下“钦差大臣”的架子，多替施工单位解决一些工作中的实际问题。
