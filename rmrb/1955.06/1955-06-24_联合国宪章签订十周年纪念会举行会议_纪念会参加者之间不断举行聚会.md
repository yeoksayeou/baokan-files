Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd, dispatch from TASS, San Francisco, June 22nd: The Tenth Anniversary Commemorative Meeting of the United Nations Charter held a meeting on the 21st.

　　At the morning session, representatives from Belgium, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Syria, Denmark, Chile, and Liberia delivered speeches.

　　Belgian Foreign Minister and former President of the First Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Spaak, called for the implementation of the principle of peaceful coexistence between nations. Spaak welcomed the "improvement of international relations" and said that the upcoming negotiations between the heads of government of the Four Great Powers should help further ease international tensions. Spaak expressed concern about the arms race and called on all countries to follow a policy of "supervised universal disarmament." Spaak continued, "It is not enough to just pay lip service to peaceful coexistence, we must make it a reality with our actions." Spaak pointed out the universal desire of people of all countries for peace, and he called on the member states of the United Nations to work to consolidate world peace.

　　British Foreign Secretary Macmillan then spoke. He said that the existence of countries belonging to "two camps" within the United Nations seemed to make it impossible for the United Nations to guarantee "collective security." Macmillan attempted to defend the establishment of aggressive blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Macmillan said that until recently, the tensions that existed in East-West relations seemed endless, but recently the international situation has "cleared up." However, Macmillan expressed doubts about the possibility of close cooperation between major powers. Macmillan concluded by saying that Britain would make its contribution to consolidating the United Nations as an instrument of international cooperation.

　　The head of the Brazilian delegation, Valli, said in his speech that in the atomic age, war should not be used as an instrument of foreign policy. Politicians of all countries must recognize that they should resolve their contradictions through negotiations.

　　Syrian Foreign Minister Azem pointed out the rise of the liberation movement in Asia and Africa. He said: "Ten years ago, the voices of the people of Asia and Africa were hardly heard... But recently this voice has come out clearly and inspiringly from Bandung." Azem pointed out that the Bandung Conference was a positive contribution to consolidating peace. He said: "The rise of national liberation movements is an indestructible force. It is impacting the coast of Arab North Africa. Hundreds of millions of people have achieved freedom at the cost of sacrifice and sweat, fighting against huge internal difficulties and external interference. These people have replaced foreign rule with international cooperation. The rise of the liberation movement is an iron-like objective reality. This is a characteristic of our time, and the people of all countries must recognize this."

　　Chairman Van Kleffens attempted to interrupt the Syrian representative's speech, but Azem continued to deliver his speech with the support of the meeting representatives. Azem concluded by expressing his hope that the upcoming meeting of the heads of government of the Four Great Powers would promote the end of the Cold War and live up to the expectations of the people of the world.

　　Danish Foreign Minister Hansen then spoke. He called on the United Nations organization to resolve the issues of disarmament, peaceful use of atomic energy, and technical assistance to backward countries as soon as possible.

　　Chilean Foreign Minister Olson said that the people of all countries demand peace, and he hoped that countries with different social systems could find a basis for peaceful coexistence.

　　At the afternoon session, representatives from Israel, Pakistan, New Zealand, Denmark, Greece, Colombia, Panama, and Iceland spoke. They called for strengthening the United Nations organization and continuing to work to ease international tensions. Icelandic representative Thorrs pointed out that the international situation had greatly improved in recent months. He said that the people of all countries demand peace. They are faced with two paths: one path is the path of division and conflict, which will inevitably lead to war and destruction. The other path is the path of peaceful coexistence and cooperation of all countries.

Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd, dispatch from TASS, San Francisco, June 22nd: During the United Nations Commemorative Meeting, many gatherings were constantly held among the meeting participants.

　　On the 21st, US President Eisenhower held a reception to entertain the heads of delegations from various countries attending the United Nations Commemorative Meeting. The head of the Soviet delegation, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Molotov, attended the reception.

　　On the afternoon of the 21st, Molotov held talks with French Foreign Minister Pinay.

　　On the evening of the 21st, US Secretary of State Dulles hosted a banquet to entertain the heads of delegations from various countries attending the United Nations Commemorative Meeting. The head of the Soviet delegation, Molotov, attended the banquet.

　　On the evening of the 21st, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held talks here with British Foreign Secretary Macmillan. They exchanged views on current international issues during the talks.

    联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会举行会议
    纪念会参加者之间不断举行聚会
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社旧金山二十二日讯：联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会二十一日举行会议。
    在上午会议上，比利时、英国、巴西、叙利亚、丹麦、智利和利比里亚的代表发表了演说。
    比利时外交大臣、前联合国大会第一届会议主席斯巴克呼吁实行各国之间和平共处的原则。斯巴克对“国际关系的改善”表示欢迎，并且说：即将举行的四大国政府首脑的谈判应当有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势。斯巴克对军备竞赛表示忧虑，他要求所有国家遵循“有监督的普遍裁减军备”的政策。斯巴克接着说，“光是口头上说可以和平共处还是不够的，我们必须以自己的行动来使它成为现实。”斯巴克指出了各国人民要求和平的普遍愿望，他要求联合国各会员国为巩固世界和平而努力。
    英国外交大臣麦克米伦接着讲话。他说什么联合国内存在着属于“两个阵营”的国家似乎就使联合国不可能保证“集体安全”。麦克米伦力图为建立北大西洋集团、东南亚条约组织这一类侵略集团辩护。麦克米伦说，直到不久以前为止，在东西方关系中所存在的紧张局势看来仍然是无止境的，然而最近国际局势“晴朗”起来了。但是，麦克米伦又对大国密切合作的可能性表示怀疑。麦克米伦最后说，英国将作出它的贡献来巩固作为国际合作的工具的联合国。
    巴西代表团团长瓦利在发言中说，在原子时代，战争不应当被用来作为外交政策的工具。各国政治家都得承认：他们应当以谈判的方式解决他们之间的矛盾。
      叙利亚外交部长阿泽姆指出亚非国家解放运动的高涨。他说：“十年前，亚非各国人民的声音几乎听不见……但是最近这种声音清晰地和令人振奋地从万隆传出来了。”阿泽姆指出，万隆会议是对巩固和平的一个积极贡献。他说：“民族解放运动的高涨是不可摧毁的力量。它冲击着阿拉伯北非沿岸。数亿人民在同巨大的内部困难和外部干涉作斗争中以牺牲和血汗的代价，取得了自由。这些人民以国际合作代替了外国统治。解放运动的高涨是铁一般的客观现实。这是我们时代的特点，各国人民都必须认识这一点。”
    主席范克里芬斯企图打断叙利亚代表的发言，但是阿泽姆在会议代表们的支持下继续发表他的演说。阿泽姆最后表示希望即将举行的四大国政府首脑会议能够促成冷战的结束，不辜负全世界人民的期望。
    丹麦外交大臣汉森接着发言。他要求联合国组织尽快解决裁军问题、和平利用原子能问题和对落后国家的技术援助问题。
    智利外交部长奥尔逊说，各国人民要求和平，他希望不同社会制度的国家能够找到和平共处的基础。
    在下午会议上，以色列、巴基斯坦、新西兰、丹麦、希腊、哥伦比亚、巴拿马和冰岛的代表发言。他们呼吁加强联合国组织，为缓和国际紧张局势而继续努力。冰岛代表托尔斯指出，在最近几个月里，国际局势有了很大的改善。他说，各国人民要求和平。他们面前摆着两条道路：一条道路是分歧和冲突的道路，它必然会导致战争和破坏。另一条道路是一切国家和平共处和合作的道路。
    新华社二十二日讯　塔斯社旧金山二十二日讯：在联合国纪念会举行期间，会议参加者之间不断举行许多聚会。
    二十一日，美国总统艾森豪威尔举行招待会，招待出席联合国纪念会的各国代表团团长。苏联代表团团长、苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫出席了招待会。
    二十一日下午，莫洛托夫同法国外交部长比内举行了会谈。
    二十一日晚上，美国国务卿杜勒斯设宴招待出席联合国纪念会的各国代表团团长。苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫出席了宴会。
    二十一日晚，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫同英国外交大臣麦克米伦在这里举行了会谈。他们在会谈中就当前的国际问题交换了意见。
