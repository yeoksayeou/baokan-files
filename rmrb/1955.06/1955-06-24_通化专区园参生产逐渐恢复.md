    Garden Ginseng Production Gradually Recovering in Tonghua Prefecture
    Tonghua Prefecture in Jilin Province, including Fusong, Ji'an, Tonghua, Jingyu, Changbai, and other counties, cultivates garden ginseng, with Fusong and Ji'an counties producing the most, followed by Tonghua, Jingyu, and Changbai counties. Fusong County has a history of ginseng cultivation for over a hundred years, with peak annual production reaching over 370,000 jin. Later, under Japanese puppet rule, it suffered destruction, and annual production dropped to around 60,000 jin. Since liberation, garden ginseng production has gradually recovered. Fusong County alone has over 188,000 zhang (each zhang of area is one zhang in length and five chi in width) of garden ginseng this year, and it is expected to produce over 120,000 jin of dried ginseng this year. According to statistics from seven counties near Changbai Mountain in late May, the current garden ginseng area is over 250,000 zhang, and the total garden ginseng production this year is expected to exceed 160,000 jin.

    通化专区园参生产逐渐恢复
    吉林省通化专区共有抚松、辑安、通化、靖宇、长白等县栽培园参，其中抚松、辑安两县出产为最多，通化、靖宇、长白等县次之。抚松县栽参已有一百多年历史，最高年产量曾达到三十七万多斤。后在日伪统治下遭受摧残年产量降到六万斤左右。解放以来，园参生产逐渐恢复，抚松全县今年已有园参十八万八千多丈（每丈面积是长一丈、宽五尺），今年可出产干参十二万多斤。根据长白山附近的七个县五月下旬的统计，现在园参面积二十五万多丈，今年共可出产园参十六万多斤。
