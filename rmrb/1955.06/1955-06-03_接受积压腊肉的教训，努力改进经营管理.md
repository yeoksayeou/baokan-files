    Accepting the Lesson of Stockpiled Cured Meat and Striving to Improve Business Management
    Shang Zijin, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce
    On May 11th, the People's Daily published an article entitled "Blind Purchases Inevitably Lead to Stockpiles," which criticized the Hunan Provincial commercial departments for failing to study market needs, blindly purchasing goods, and causing a large backlog of cured meat. This event shows that the problems in the operation and management of state-owned commerce in Hunan Province are quite serious.
    The stockpiling of cured meat occurred mainly because we have serious bureaucracy and fail to implement the instructions of our superiors conscientiously. As early as September of last year, the Ministry of Commerce decided that, to avoid causing confusion, the China Food Company would be responsible for the main operation of meat products. However, we did not abide by this decision, only agreeing in principle that the Food Company would be in charge, and at the same time, we approved the plan for the Native Produce Company to operate 570,000 catties of cured meat. Moreover, we neither thoroughly reviewed the planned figures beforehand nor carefully checked them afterward. It was not until mid-February, when the cured meat backlog had become very serious, that we discovered this problem. This is a concrete manifestation of the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce's superficial work and satisfaction with general bureaucratic leadership. At the same time, the managers of the Native Produce and Food Companies were busy with daily affairs, lacking in-depth leadership, and did not clearly explain the policies and purchasing authority to their subordinate branches and the procurement personnel they dispatched. They also lacked specific checks on the procurement personnel's purchases. The policy understanding of the procurement personnel is generally very low, and under bureaucratic leadership, a purely task-oriented viewpoint detached from policy is bound to arise. In addition, the lack of unified control over procurement work, with "purchasers flying everywhere," further fueled the blindness in business operations.
    Capitalist business ideology and practices are also one of the main roots of the stockpiling of cured meat. Seeing that cured meat was in short supply and selling well at high prices, the Food and Native Produce Companies competed to operate it. They did not consider their own resources or the market capacity, purchasing not only within the province but also from Guizhou and Sichuan, believing that "the more the better" and "with goods, there is no worry about selling." Before the holidays, seeing brisk market sales, they conservatively hoarded goods; after the holidays, with a flood of goods, cured meat flooded the market, so they promoted sales inside and outside the province, disrupting the normal circulation of goods. These are all capitalist operating methods, which have nothing in common with the socialist commercial requirements of organizing supply according to plan.
    Chaotic systems, lack of close contact between superiors and subordinates, and an unsound statistical system are also important reasons for the stockpiling of cured meat.
    In order to learn from the stockpiling of cured meat, we have decided to do the following:
    First, strengthen political and ideological education and oppose capitalist business ideology and practices. Our bourgeoisie still exists, and we are often in contact with capitalist enterprises in our work; some of our employees still retain remnants of capitalist ideology; and political and ideological education within state-owned commerce is very weak. Therefore, capitalist ideology can grow. We plan to use the discussion of the cured meat stockpiling incident to clarify to all employees the nature and tasks of socialist commerce, draw a clear line between the operating principles of socialist commerce and the operating principles of capitalism, and strengthen education on cherishing public property, gradually learning to use socialist economic laws to guide all economic work of the enterprise.
    Second, strengthen investigation and research, grasp market capacity and people's needs, improve the planning of commodity purchase and sales, and oppose subjective business operations. The main operating company should take on the responsibility of planning and arranging the entire market, reversing the tendency to only consider the business of its own unit, disregard market changes, not be responsible to production and the market, and only care about quantity without quality.
    Third, immediately change the bureaucratic style of only sitting in the office to read documents and issue orders. When assigning work, it is necessary to clearly explain the policies, and the assigned work must be organized with planned, step-by-step, and focused in-depth inspections, not only checking the amount but also checking the goods and the implementation of policies.
    Fourth, improve various systems and improve the quality of work. Due to the unsound internal systems, lack of close contact between superiors and subordinates and inside and outside, and unclear division of labor in various state-owned companies in Hunan Province, discrepancies between accounts, inconsistencies between accounts and goods, and extra losses often occur. Statistical and financial accounting work cannot promptly and correctly reflect business operations. We must strive to eliminate this serious chaotic phenomenon. In this way, we can make up for the serious losses we have suffered in the cured meat stockpiling incident and other aspects, and further play the role of socialist commerce.

    接受积压腊肉的教训，努力改进经营管理
    湖南省商业厅厅长  尚子锦
    五月十一日，人民日报发表了“盲目进货必定积压”一文，批评了湖南省商业部门不研究市场需要，盲目进货，造成大量积压腊肉的事件。这个事件说明湖南省国营商业经营管理上的问题是相当严重的。
    积压腊肉的事件所以发生，主要是由于我们存在着严重的官僚主义和不认真执行上级的指示。商业部在去年九月曾经决定，为了避免造成混乱，由中国食品公司负责主营肉类。但我们没有遵守这个决定，只是在原则上同意食品公司主营，和这同时，也批准了土产公司经营腊肉五十七万斤的计划。而且，事先对计划数字既未深入审核；事后又疏于检查。直到二月中旬，腊肉积压已十分严重，才发现这一问题。这是商业厅工作不深入，满足于
  一般化的官僚主义领导的具体表现。同时，土产、食品两公司经理忙于日常事务，缺乏深入领导，对所属分支单位及其所派出的采购人员没有明确交代政策和采购权限，对采购人员的进货缺乏具体检查。而采购员的政策水平一般很低，在官僚主义的领导下，就必然会产生脱离政策的单纯任务观点。加上采购工作没有统一掌握，“采购员满天飞”，就更加助长了经营上的盲目性。
    资本主义的经营思想和作风也是产生积压腊肉事件的主要根源之一。食品、土产两公司看到腊肉供不应求，价高畅销，便争着经营。也不问家底，也不问市场容量。不但在省内，而且向贵州、四川进货。认为“越多越好”、“有货不愁卖”。节前看到市场旺销，保守惜售；节后货源涌到，腊肉充斥市场，于是又向省内外推销，打乱了商品的正常流转。这些，都是资本主义经营方式，和社会主义商业要求按计划组织供应毫无共同之点。
    制度混乱、上下联系不密切、统计制度不健全，也是积压腊肉事件发生的重要原因。
    为了接受积压腊肉事件的教训，我们决定要做好下面几项工作：
    一、加强政治思想教育、反对资本主义经营思想作风。我国资产阶级还存在，在工作中又经常同资本主义企业发生接触；我们的职工中还有一些人保存着资本主义思想的残余；国营商业内部的政治思想教育工作又很薄弱；因此，资本主义思想就得以滋长。我们准备通过积压腊肉事件的讨论，使全体职工明确社会主义商业的性质和任务，划清社会主义商业经营原则和资本主义经营原则的界限和本质的差别，加强爱护公共财物的教育，逐渐学会运用社会主义经济法则来指导企业的全部经济工作。
    二、加强调查研究，掌握市场容量和人民需要，提高商品购销的计划性，反对主观主义的经营。主营公司应担负起计划和安排整个市场的责任，扭转只考虑本单位业务、不顾市场变化、对生产对市场不负责任和只顾数量不顾质量的偏向。
    三、立即改变只坐在办公室里看公文、发号施令的官僚主义作风。布置工作时必须明确交代政策，对所布置的工作，必须组织力量有计划有步骤有重点地进行深入检查，不但要检查金额，而且要检查商品，检查执行政策的情况。
    四、健全各项制度，提高工作质量。湖南省各国营公司由于内部制度不健全，上下内外联系不密切和分工不明确，常常发生账同账不符、账同货不符以及额外损耗等现象。统计和财务会计工作不能及时地正确地反映业务经营情况。这种严重的混乱现象我们要努力消除。这样，才可以弥补我们在积压腊肉事件上和其他方面所发生的严重损失，进一步发挥社会主义商业的作用。
