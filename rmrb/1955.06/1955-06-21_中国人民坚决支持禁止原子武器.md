The Chinese People Firmly Support the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons
    Cheng Guangrui

    Five months ago, the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, held in Vienna, issued an "Appeal to the People of the World," calling on the people of all countries to launch a large-scale signature campaign to demand the destruction of all atomic weapons, an immediate halt to the production of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of atomic war. At that time, the North Atlantic aggressive bloc council had already approved plans for atomic warfare in Europe, the American aggressive bloc intended to arm the West German militarists' army with atomic weapons, and openly propagated the notion that atomic war was inevitable. This situation posed a grave threat to world peace and security. The World Peace Council's call was very timely, drawing the attention of the people of the world to these circumstances and pointing out that they must mobilize to prevent the catastrophe of an atomic war from occurring. A large-scale movement to sign the World Peace Council Standing Committee's "Appeal to the People of the World," demanding the prohibition of all atomic weapons, rapidly unfolded in dozens of countries.

    The Chinese people fully support the World Peace Council's call. From February 14th to April 10th this year, in the short period of less than two months, over 400 million people across the country signed their names. This not only demonstrates the Chinese people's strong anger at the American's sinister atomic war plans, but also demonstrates the Chinese people's powerful strength in defending peace and opposing war.

    As everyone knows, the American aggressive bloc ultimately did not dare to use atomic weapons in the Korean War and the Indochina War as they had shouted and planned. The powerful force of the people, as expressed in the more than 500 million signatures on the Stockholm Appeal against atomic weapons, restrained them. As World Peace Council President Joliot-Curie assessed, the will of the people of all countries expressed in the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign played a major role in preventing the use of atomic weapons in Asia and easing international tensions. And over 220 million Chinese people signed this declaration.

    American atomic maniacs once specifically threatened the Chinese people with atomic weapons. They clamored that the American Seventh Fleet, constantly provoking the Chinese people in the Taiwan area, was equipped with atomic weapons, and threatened to bomb Chinese coastal cities with atomic bombs. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also openly threatened that the United States intended to intervene in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan with naval and air forces equipped with atomic weapons. The imperialists hated the liberated Chinese people with a vengeance. However, they helplessly saw that none of their shouts and threats could intimidate the Chinese people who had already stood up. The American "Washington Post" admitted that the Chinese people are not afraid of atomic bombs. The Chinese people answered the atomic maniacs' clamor by signing the World Peace Council Standing Committee's "Appeal to the People of the World" with twice the strength they showed when endorsing the Stockholm Appeal.

    Faced with two completely different paths on the issue of atomic energy, the Chinese people's position is very clear. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the manufacture and use of atomic weapons, and advocate vigorously developing the peaceful use of atomic energy for the benefit of mankind. The Soviet Union's achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy, its sincere willingness to publicize its experience in the peaceful use of atomic energy to the world, and its practical actions in helping China and other people's democracies peacefully utilize atomic energy have created the most favorable conditions for international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. Not long ago, the Soviet Union once again put forward new proposals for reducing armaments, prohibiting atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of new wars, including concrete proposals and feasible methods for abolishing atomic weapons. The Chinese people fully support the Soviet Union's constructive proposals and warmly welcome the Soviet Union's initiative in using atomic energy for the benefit of the people.

    Recently, the efforts of the world's peace forces have had a significant impact on the international situation. The success of the Asian-African Conference, the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and other major actions by peace-loving countries aimed at strengthening world peace have eased international tensions to some extent. The upcoming Four-Power Conference provides an extremely favorable opportunity to further ease international tensions, increase international trust, and thereby strengthen world peace. The people have reason to demand that the Four-Power Conference reach agreements on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the peaceful use of atomic energy, as well as other pressing international issues. However, people see that the practitioners of the "policy of strength" led by the United States are moving in the opposite direction. They are creating difficulties and obstacles for the Four-Power Conference and delaying the discussion of the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals. American aggressive forces are still constantly advocating atomic warfare.

    The United States has indicated that it will continue to conduct atomic weapons tests in the Pacific. In the next fiscal year, the United States will also increase its atomic weapons appropriation in order to expand the production of atomic weapons. Out of a clear intention to create an atmosphere of atomic war, the United States, a few days ago, under the personal command of the U.S. President, held a three-day nationwide "largest-ever" atomic war drill. This shows that although the American atomic maniacs have lost their monopoly on atomic weapons and the "advantage" of hydrogen weapons, they have no intention of abandoning atomic intimidation and preparations for atomic war. They are also trying their best to make people believe that atomic war will definitely come. In this regard, it is worth noting that the American monopoly capital's newspapers have recently been spreading a false argument, insisting that the Soviet Union is preparing a "sudden attack." People smell a strong gunpowder smell from this fabricated propaganda. The politically increasingly isolated imperialist war forces are betting on the false hope of launching a sudden attack with atomic weapons to achieve a lightning victory.

    This is a serious situation threatening world peace and security. This makes the struggle against atomic weapons of even more urgent significance. The World Peace Council rightly pointed out in its recent communique: The signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons must continue, so that the people of all countries will not relax their vigilance for a minute.

    The World Peace Congress, with the participation of representatives from all walks of life in various countries, to be held in Helsinki, will freely discuss the current important issue of banning atomic weapons and other pressing issues. This is of particular significance in the current situation. Undoubtedly, the contributions made by the Congress will further promote the anti-atomic weapons movement currently unfolding on a large scale in various countries. The Chinese people, like the peace-loving people of all countries, fully support the World Peace Council's call and resolutely continue to fight against the use of atomic weapons. Past facts have proved that as long as the world's peace forces are united and mobilized, they can block the American aggressive group's path to atomic war.

    中国人民坚决支持禁止原子武器
    程光锐
    五个月以前，在维也纳召开的世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议，发布了“告全世界人民书”，号召各国人民发动一次大规模的签名运动，要求毁掉一切原子武器，立刻停止制造原子武器并消除原子战争的威胁。那时候，北大西洋侵略集团理事会已经批准了在欧洲进行原子战争的计划，美国侵略集团打算以原子武器武装西德军国主义者的军队，并公开宣传原子战争是不可避免的论调。这种情况对于世界和平与安全形成了严重的威胁。世界和平理事会的号召是非常适时的，它及时提起世界人民注意到这些情况，并且指出他们必须动员起来，阻止一场原子战争的灾祸发生。大规模的在世界和平理事会常务委员会“告全世界人民书”上签名、要求禁绝一切原子武器的运动迅速地在几十个国家里展开了。
    中国人民完全支持世界和平理事会的号召。从今年二月十四日开始到四月十日结束，在不满两个月的短短的时期中，全国就有四亿多人签了名。这不仅表现出中国人民对美国罪恶的原子战争计划的强烈愤怒，而且也表现出中国人民保卫和平、反对战争的强大力量。
    大家知道，美国侵略集团终于没有敢于按照它叫喊和策划的那样，在朝鲜战争和印度支那战争中使用原子武器。反对原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上的五亿多签名所表现的人民的强大力量遏止了他们。正像世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里所评价的，在斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动中所表现出来的各国人民的意志，在阻止原子武器在亚洲被使用和缓和国际紧张局势方面起了主要的作用。而在这个宣言上就有两亿两千多万中国人民签了名。
    美国原子狂人曾经特别以原子武器恐吓中国人
  民。他们扬言不断在台湾地区向中国人民挑衅的美
  国第七舰队装备有原子武器，又威胁说要用原子弹
  来轰炸中国沿海的城市。美国国务卿杜勒斯也公开
  恫吓说美国打算用配备有原子武器的海空军部队来
  干涉中国人民解放台湾。帝国主义者对获得了解放
  的中国人民切齿痛恨。然而，他们无可奈何地看到，他们的任何叫喊和威胁都吓不倒已经站起来的中国人民。美国的“华盛顿邮报”就承认，中国人民是不怕原子弹的人。中国人民以比拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言时加倍的力量在世界和平理事会常务委员会
  “告全世界人民书”上签名，来回答原子狂人的叫嚣。
    在原子能问题的截然不同的两条路线面前，中国人民的立场是十分鲜明的。中国人民坚决反对制造和使用原子武器，而主张全力发展原子能的和平利用，为人类造福。苏联在和平利用原子能方面的成就，它愿意向全世界公布它和平利用原子能经验的真诚态度，以及它帮助中国和其他人民民主国家和平利用原子能的实际行为，为在和平利用原子能方面进行国际合作创造了最有利的条件。不久前，苏联再一次提出关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的新建议，其中包括了废除原子武器的具体建议和切实可行的办法。中国人民完全支持苏联的建设性建议，并且热烈地欢迎苏联在以原子能为人民造福方面的创导。
    最近，世界和平力量的努力对国际局势起了重大的影响。亚非会议的成功，奥地利国家条约的签订，苏联和南斯拉夫关系的正常化，以及爱好和平国家另外一些旨在加强世界和平的重大行动，已使国际紧张局势有所缓和。即将召开的四大国会议为进一步缓和国际局势、增加国际间的信任从而加强世界和平提供了极为有利的机会。人民有理由要求四大国会议就禁止原子武器和和平使用原子能问题以及其他当前国际上迫切的问题达成协议。然而，人们看到，以美国为首的“实力政策”的奉行者正在背道而驰。他们正在为四大国会议制造困难和障碍，并且拖延苏联裁军新建议的讨论。美国侵略势力仍在不断地鼓吹原子战争。
    美国表示它将继续在太平洋进行原子武器试验。在下一财政年度中，美国还要增加原子武器拨款，以便扩大制造原子武器。出于明显的制造原子战争气氛的意图，美国前几天还在美国总统亲自指挥下举行了为期三天的全国性的“有史以来规模最大的”原子战争演习。这表明：美国原子狂人们虽然已经失去了原子武器的垄断地位和氢武器的“优势”，却丝毫也没有打算放弃原子恫吓和原子战争的准备。他们并且还竭力要使人相信原子战争一定会要到来。在这方面，值得注意的是美国垄断资本的报刊近来正在散布一种虚妄的论调，硬说苏联在准备“突然的攻击”。人们从这种无中生有的宣传中嗅到浓重的火药气味。政治上日趋孤立的帝国主义战争势力是在把赌注压到用原子武器发动突然袭击以取得闪电胜利的虚妄希望上。
    这是一种威胁世界和平和安全的严重情况。这使得反对原子武器的斗争具有了更加迫切的意义。世界和平理事会在最近发表的公报中正确地指出：反对使用原子武器的签名运动必须继续进行，使各国人民一分钟也不放松警惕。
    即将在赫尔辛基举行的、有各国各阶层公众代表参加的世界和平大会，将对禁止原子武器这个当前重要问题和其他一些迫切问题进行自由讨论。这在目前情况下具有特别重大的意义。无疑地，大会作出的贡献将会进一步推动目前在各国大规模展开的反对原子武器运动。中国人民和各国爱好和平的人民一样，完全支持世界和平理事会的号召，并坚决地为反对使用原子武器而继续斗争。过去的事实证明，只要世界和平力量一致动员起来，就能够堵住美国侵略集团走向原子战争的道路。
