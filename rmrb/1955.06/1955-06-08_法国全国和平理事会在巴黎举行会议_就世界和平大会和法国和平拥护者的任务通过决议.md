    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, TASS, Paris: The French National Peace Council held a meeting in Paris from the 4th to the 6th of June. French National Assembly member Delavigne made a report at the meeting on the tasks of the movement to defend peace. He emphasized the great significance of the Bandung Conference, the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, and the Soviet-Yugoslav talks for strengthening peace.

    The meeting elected the Presidium and Executive Committee of the French National Peace Council and passed two resolutions.

    The resolution regarding the upcoming World Peace Congress stated that the congress would help seek ways to ease international tensions, and the French public would send a large delegation to participate in the congress.

    The second resolution addressed the tasks of French peace advocates, emphasizing the dangers of the policy of arming West Germany, expanding armaments, and preparing for atomic warfare. The resolution particularly stressed: the ratification of the Paris Agreements has seriously damaged France's position in Europe and the world as a whole. France's vital interests require the Four Power Heads of Government Conference to achieve success.
