The Party Branch of Government Organs Must Conscientiously Lead Theoretical Study
Zhang Shihong

For more than two years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Party organizations in government organs in various places have made great achievements in leading the theoretical study of cadres. These achievements are inseparable from the efforts of the Party's primary organizations – the branches – because the theoretical study of staff in government organs in various places is carried out under the direct leadership of the Party branches.

However, there are still some government organ branches that have not effectively taken on the responsibility of leading theoretical study. Some branch committees have not studied the theoretical study issues of their own organs for a long time, and have assigned this important work only to the propaganda committee member. Some propaganda committee members are also not very responsible, and push this important work to one or two study secretaries. Some branches, although they have formulated study plans, do not seriously check the implementation of the plans. Usually, they just issue notices based on the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, or occasionally listen to reports. What is the learning situation of the staff? What difficulties are there in learning? The branch either does not know, or knows but does not try to solve them. Some branches are satisfied with general mobilization, and vaguely assign so-called "principal leadership." Obviously, this situation should be corrected.

The reason for this situation is that these branches still have some incorrect views on theoretical study.

Some branches believe that the branch has too much work, and leading theoretical study is not the main work of the branch, so they have relaxed the leadership of theoretical study. This view is obviously wrong. They do not know that theoretical education is the foundation of the Party's ideological construction. The strength of the Party's ideological leadership is inseparable from the strength of the Party's Marxist-Leninist theoretical education, and the strength of theoretical education depends on the actual leadership of Party organizations at all levels over this work. If the Party organization of a department strengthens the theoretical education of Party members and non-Party members, the Party's ideological leadership in that department will be fundamentally strengthened, and the Party's work will be carried out smoothly; conversely, the Party's ideological leadership in that department must be in a weak state, which is precisely the fundamental reason for various loopholes in the work. Because of this, Comrades Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong repeatedly taught us that we must care about the theoretical study of the staff. We must recognize that carrying out Party education and supervising that Communist Party members have the necessary minimum knowledge of Marxism-Leninism is the most important task of all Party organizations. Therefore, the Party branch must not shirk its responsibility. We must regard theoretical education as one of our main tasks.

Some branches believe that our work here is too busy, and theoretical study has to be relaxed. This idea is also wrong. In special circumstances, it is possible and permissible that busy work affects theoretical study, but in general, it is wrong to use busy work as an excuse to not adhere to theoretical study for a long time. Just comparing the leadership of the theoretical study of the Railway Ministry's Locomotive Bureau branch with the Labor and Wage Bureau branch can show the problem. The work of these two bureaus is relatively busy, but the Locomotive Bureau's theoretical study can be maintained, while the Labor and Wage Bureau's theoretical study is not good. What is the reason? Please look at the facts: The Locomotive Bureau's branch often studies learning issues at branch committee meetings, arranges learning, and the branch propaganda and education committee member is also practically responsible, grasping the learning system and the work of the counselors tightly, and also cares about the learning of the attending cadres. Because of the importance attached to it by the branch, the theoretical study of Party members and non-Party members in this unit is also more serious. The Labor and Wage Bureau branch is weak in its ideological and organizational leadership of theoretical study. The learning core group gradually loses its core role, the counselors are frequently replaced, and many Party members (including branch committee members) are busy with their work and have little interest in learning. They more or less have the mistaken idea that "if the work is not done well, you will be criticized, but if you don't learn well, there is nothing." It can be seen that the key to the problem is still whether the branch attaches importance to the leadership of theoretical study, and not whether the work is busy.

Some branches also believe that if the administrative leadership does not support it, the branch itself is powerless. This is a wrong view that deviates from the Party's leadership principles. It is a fact that some administrative responsible staff are not concerned and supportive enough of the branch's theoretical education work. However, theoretical education work must be directly led by the Party organization and cannot be pushed to the administration. The work of the branch is to actively and actively strive for the support of the administrative responsible staff, rather than relying on the administrative responsible staff. Of course, if these administrative responsible comrades who do not attach importance to theoretical study are Communist Party members, the branch should supervise these Party members and correct their wrong attitudes. For example, Wei Hengcang, deputy director of the Labor and Wage Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and a Communist Party member, has an attitude of indifference to the theoretical study of the bureau, and often arranges some tasks before the study, requiring the staff to complete them in a short time. In order to complete these tasks, the staff has to take up the study time. However, the branch has not adhered to the Party's principles to fight against this bad phenomenon. In this way, the responsibility is not only on Comrade Wei Hengcang, but the branch is also responsible. Why did it not criticize Comrade Wei Hengcang's wrong attitude of not attaching importance to theoretical study and supervise him to correct it?

Some branches believe that the branch leaders themselves have a low theoretical level and it is no wonder that they do not lead theoretical study well. This statement is also untenable. Although a low theoretical level will cause difficulties for the branch to lead theoretical study, this should never be an excuse for the branch not to lead theoretical study well. Because the branch is a Party organization, the branch should use the power of the organization to carry out organizational work and ideological work on theoretical study to solve various organizational forms, study time, and ideological problems in theoretical study. As for the difficulties and problems of theoretical study itself, the branch can organize theoretical teachers, counselors, and comrades in senior groups to solve them. If necessary, it can also ask the higher-level Party committee to help solve them. In fact, this is also an organizational work in the branch's leadership of theoretical study. As long as this organizational work is done well, even if the theoretical level of the branch leaders is low, it is still possible to lead theoretical study well.

According to the experience of various places, the branch should grasp the following links in leading theoretical study.

First of all, the supervision of the theoretical study of Party members should be strengthened to eliminate the abnormal phenomenon of backward learning of some Party members in some units. This is not only because studying theory is the primary task of Party members, but also because doing a good job in Party member study is a key to doing a good job in the study of all staff. Experience in various places has proved that if the branch is good at combining theoretical education with the ideological life within the Party, inspiring Party members' interest and awareness in learning, and carrying out necessary criticism and self-criticism, it can enable each Party member to play a backbone role in learning. For example, the Guiyang Municipal Party Committee's organ branch first criticized Party members who were overly ambitious, unrealistic, and did not read seriously in the Party's organizational life, and called on Party members to read seriously and take the lead in learning well, which greatly promoted learning. It should be pointed out that administrative responsible comrades must also abide by the branch's decisions on learning issues. Although the comrades who participate in the senior groups in some departments are not directly led by the Party branch, the comrades in the senior groups should report their learning situation to their affiliated branches, and the Party branch should also conduct inspections and supervision of their learning situation at certain times, with no exceptions.

Secondly, in order to strengthen the ideological leadership of theoretical study, the branch committee should regularly study the ideological situation and various problems in learning, make resolutions, and hand them over to the propaganda committee member for execution. Comrades who truly attach importance to the leadership of theoretical study should be selected to serve as the propaganda committee member of the branch to ensure the implementation of the branch's resolutions. Some branches elect two propaganda committee members, and designate one propaganda committee member to specifically lead theoretical study; some branches are responsible by the propaganda committee member, and establish a special organization to lead daily study, which is effective for the branch to strengthen the leadership of theoretical study. In order to exchange learning experiences, improve learning enthusiasm, the branch can use various effective methods, such as organizing comrades in senior study groups to report to comrades in the next level study group, convening various seminars, holding wall newspapers, cultivating advanced study groups or individuals, and so on. It should be recognized that only by strengthening ideological leadership can we consolidate the learning system and learning discipline. Some branches do not pay attention to ideological enlightenment work, one-sidedly emphasize the system and discipline, and even use disguised administrative methods to force everyone to learn, these deviations should be prevented and corrected.

Indeed, it is not easy for the organ branch to lead theoretical study, there are many difficulties. If the branch wants to lead theoretical study well, it must carry out a lot of arduous ideological work and organizational work. For example, how to organize the theoretical indicators, how to implement the principle of combining theory with practice, how to make the study plan realistic and complete it on schedule, and so on, have not been solved very well. At present, we do not have much experience, and there are even fewer typical successful experiences. This requires us to summarize experience well and improve this work.

At present, the high and intermediate groups of staff in government organs across the country have successively entered the final stage of studying Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union". In the process of studying Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union", Party branches have accumulated a lot of experience in leading theoretical study. Therefore, doing a good job in this summary work conscientiously and practically will be of great help to improving the future leadership of theoretical production by the branch. Government organ branches and Party committees at all levels should attach importance to this summary work, and use the experience of this summary to educate government organ branches and help government organ branches further improve the level of leading theoretical study.

    机关党支部必须认真领导理论学习
    章世鸿
    两年多来，在党中央领导下，各地机关党组织在领导干部理论学习方面取得了很大的成绩。这些成绩的取得是和党的基层组织——支部的努力分不开的，因为各地机关工作人员的理论学习是在党支部直接领导下进行的。
    但目前还有一些机关支部，并没有切实负起领导理论学习的责任。有的支部委员会长期不研究本机关的理论学习问题，把这项重要工作仅仅交给宣传委员去负责，有些宣传委员也不大负责，把这项重要工作推给一两个学习干事去做。有些支部虽然制定了学习计划，但却不认真检查计划执行情况，平时只是根据上级党委的指示发发通知，或偶然听听汇报。工作人员的学习情况怎样？学习中还有什么困难？支部或者是不知道，或者知道了也不设法解决。有的支部则满足于一般的动员、笼统地布置一类的所谓“原则领导”。显然，这种情况是应该纠正的。
    这种情况所以产生，是因为这些支部对理论学习还有一些不正确的看法。
    有的支部认为：支部的工作太多，而领导理论学习并不是支部的主要工作，因而放松了对理论学习的领导。这种看法显然是不对的。他们不知道，理论教育工作是党的思想建设的根本。党的思想领导的强弱，和党的马克思列宁主义理论教育的强弱是分不开的，而理论教育的强弱则又决定于各级党组织对这一工作的实际领导。那一个部门的党组织加强了党员和非党员的理论教育，那一个部门党的思想领导就会从根本上加强起来，党的各项工作才会顺利开展；相反，则那一个部门党的思想领导一定处于薄弱的状态，而这恰巧是工作中发生各种漏洞的根本原因。正因为如此，列宁、斯大林和毛泽东同志屡次教导我们，必须关心工作人员的理论学习。必须认识：进行党的教育，以及监督共产党员具备马克思列宁主义必要的起码知识，是一切党组织的头等重要的任务。因此，党的支部决不能推诿自己的责任。必须把理论教育看作是自己的主要任务之一。
    有的支部认为：我们这里业务太忙，理论学习只好放松些。这种想法也是不对的。在特殊情况下，业力忙影响理论学习是可能的，也是可以允许的，但在一般情况下，藉口业务忙，长期不坚持理论学习，那就是错误的了。只要把铁道部机务局支部同劳动工资局支部的领导学习情况对照一下即可看出问题的所在。这两个局的业务都是比较繁忙，但机务局的理论学习却能够坚持，而劳动工资局的理论学习就不好。原因在那里呢？请看事实：机务局的支部常在支委会上研究学习问题，安排学习，支部宣教委员也切实负责，对学习制度和辅导员的工作抓得较紧，对出勤干部的学习也很关心。由于支部的重视，这个单位的党员和非党员的理论学习也较认真。而劳动工资局支部对理论学习的思想领导和组织领导都薄弱，学习核心组逐渐失去核心作用，辅导员经常更换，不少党员（包括支部委员在内）忙于业务，学习兴趣不高，他们或多或少存在着“工作做不好要受批评，学习学不好没有什么”的错误想法。由此可见，问题的关键，仍然在于支部是否重视对理论学习的领导，而不在于业务是否忙碌。
    还有的支部认为：行政领导不支持，支部本身也无能为力。这是离开了党的领导原则的错误看法。某些行政负责工作人员对支部理论教育工作的关心和支持不够是事实。但理论教育工作必须由党组织直接领导，不能推给行政。支部的工作是主动地、积极地争取行政负责工作人员的支持，而不是依赖行政负责工作人员。当然，如果这些不重视理论学习的行政负责同志是共产党员，支部就应该对这些党员进行监督，纠正他们的错误态度。如铁道部劳动工资局副局长、共产党员魏恒仓同志对该局的理论学习抱着不闻不问的态度，还经常在学习之前布置一些任务，要工作人员在很短时间内完成。工作人员为了完成这些任务，不得不占用学习时间。但支部却没有坚持党的原则同这种不良现象作过斗争。这样，责任就不仅仅在于魏恒仓同志了，支部也要负责，为什么不对魏恒仓同志这种不重视理论学习的错误态度提出批评，监督他改正呢？
    有的支部认为：支部领导同志本身理论水平低，领导不好理论学习是难怪的。这种说法也是不能成立的。理论水平低虽然会造成支部领导理论学习的困难，但这绝不应该成为支部领导不好理论学习的藉口。因为支部是党的组织，支部应该运用组织的力量对理论学习进行组织工作和思想工作，来解决理论学习中的组织形式，学习时间以及思想上的种种问题。至于理论学习本身的疑难和问题，支部可以组织理论教员、辅导员、高级组的同志去解决，必要时还可以请上级党委帮助解决，实际上这也是支部领导理论学习中的一项组织工作。只要把这一组织工作作好，即使支部领导同志的理论水平较低，还是有可能把理论学习领导好的。
    根据各地的经验，支部领导理论学习应该抓住下面几个环节。
    首先，应该加强对党员的理论学习的监督，清除目前某些单位某些党员的学习落后的不正常现象。这不但因为学习理论是党员的首要主务，也因为搞好党员学习是搞好全体工作人员学习的一个关键。各地经验证明，支部善于把理论教育和党内的思想生活结合起来，启发党员的学民兴趣和自觉性，开展必要的批评和自我批评，就能使每个党员在学习中起骨干作用。如贵阳市委机关支部首先在党的组织生活中对好高鹜远、不切合实际、不认真读书的党员进行批评，号召党员认真读书带头学好，对学习起了很大的推动作用。应该指出，行政负责同志同样必须遵守支部有关学习问题的决定，尽管有些部门参加高级组的同志不直接由党支部领导，但高级组同志应该向所属支部汇报学习情况，党支部也应该在一定时期对他们的学习情况进行检查和监督，不能例外。
    其次，为了加强理论学习的思想领导，支部委员会应该定期研究学习中的思想情况和各种问题，做出决议，交宣传委员负责执行。应该挑选切实重视理论学习领导的同志来担任支部的宣传委员，以保证支部决议的贯彻。有的支部选举两个宣传委员，指定一个宣传委员专门领导理论学习；有的支部由宣传委员负责，成立领导日常学习的专门机构，这对支部加强理论学习的领导是有作用的。为了交流学习心得和经验，提高学习热情，支部可以运用各种有效的方式，如组织高级学习组的同志向下一级学习组的同志作报告，召集各种座谈会，举办墙报，培养先进的学习小组或个人等等。应该认识，只有加强思想领导，才能巩固学习制度和学习纪律。有的支部不重视思想启发工作，片面地强调制度和纪律，甚至用变相的行政方式强制大家学习，这些偏向都是应该防止和纠正的。
    的确，机关支部领导理论学习并不是轻而易举的事，困难是很多的，支部要领导好理论学习，必须进行很多艰苦的思想工作和组织工作。比如，如何组织理论指标力量的问题，如何贯彻理论联系实际的问题，如何把学习计划订得切合实际并按期完成的问题等等都还不是解决得很好的。目前，我们的经验还不多，典型的成功经验更少。这就需要我们很好地总结经验改进这一工作。
    目前，全国各地机关工作人员高、中级组已先后进入“联共（布）党史”九章至十二章学习的结束阶段。在学习“联共（布）党史”九章至十二章这一过程中，党支部都积累了不少领导理论学习的经验，因此，认真地切实地做好这次总结工作，对改进今后支部对理论学产的领导会有很大帮助。机关支部和各级党委都应该重视这次总结工作，要运用这次总结的经验，来教育机关支部，帮助机关支部把领导理论学习的水平进一步提高。
