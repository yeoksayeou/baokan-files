    The delegation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences concluded its visit to China and left Beijing on the 23rd in two groups to return home.
    Academician Bardin, head of the delegation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and members Academician Betechtin, Academician Kostenko, Corresponding Academician Tananayev, Professor Voronin, and Researcher Astafiev returned home by train. Those who saw them off at the station included Chen Boda, Zhang Jiafu, Zhu Kezhen, and Wu Youxun, vice presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as responsible persons from relevant government departments and scientists in Beijing, totaling more than 80 people.
    Delegation members Academician Gerasimov, Corresponding Academician Belousov, Corresponding Academician Mishustin, and Researcher Cherkashen returned home by plane. Those who saw them off at the airport included Zhu Kezhen, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as responsible persons from relevant government departments and scientists, totaling more than 30 people.
    On the eve of the delegation's departure from Beijing, the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a farewell banquet. Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, responsible persons from relevant government departments, and scientists in Beijing, totaling more than 100 people, attended the banquet.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: The delegation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences held a press conference in Beijing on the afternoon of the 22nd to express their impressions of their visit to China.
    Academician Bardin, head of the delegation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, first expressed on behalf of all members the common impression they had gained during their visit to China. He said: "We have seen here that the Chinese people and their government are making every effort to advance China's scientific undertakings; the scientific research work in both the scientific departments and the industrial and economic departments is large in scale, and the speed of industrial development is very fast. We have seen many factories that did not exist before and some new-style workshops that are rare even in the Soviet Union." This outstanding metallurgist, who has been engaged in scientific work for more than 40 years, specifically mentioned the names of the seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and other new-type factories, pointing out that these factories have the most advanced automated equipment in the world.
    The old scientist, who has twice won the Stalin Prize, said excitedly: "The members of our delegation were surprised that the scientific research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, government industrial departments, and universities and colleges have developed so rapidly; the funding and equipment are so abundant; and a large number of young people are embarking on scientific work with boundless enthusiasm. In order to master complex science and technology, they have shown indomitable will in their research work. We feel that all the Chinese scientists and working people we have come into contact with are displaying boundless enthusiasm in the construction of their own country."
    Bardin believes that the current problems in China's scientific research work are: the foundations in biology and agronomy are relatively good, but the foundations in some sciences are very weak, such as the exploration and exploitation of mineral resources; there are currently a large number of new forces in China's scientific research work, but there are fewer scientific cadres leading the research work.
    Corresponding Academician Belousov, a geologist, said: "The large-scale development of mineral resources and other natural resources currently underway in China is in the hands of a group of scientists and prospectors who are full of enthusiasm for their work." He estimated that valuable mineral deposits and abundant natural resources are buried in many areas of China that have not yet been discovered. He said that the geological experts in their delegation have discussed with Chinese scientists how to develop these resources in a planned way.
    Corresponding Academician Mishustin, a microbiologist, said: "Before liberation, China's microbiological research work was limited to medical microbiology, and the strength was very small. After liberation, Chinese scientists' research work in microbiology has developed to agriculture, soil science, and the food industry." He particularly mentioned China's major achievements in antibiotic research, saying that China's achievements in medical microbiological research have greatly reduced the incidence of infectious diseases among the Chinese people.
    Corresponding Academician Tananayev, a chemist, said: "China has made great progress in chemistry. For example, the research on using physical and chemical methods for analysis in analytical chemistry has made great progress; theoretical and practical application research has also been carried out in inorganic chemistry, such as new methods for using mineral fertilizers, etc., and have been applied in industrial production."
    Professor Voronin, a physiologist, said that he and physiologist Cherkashen felt that Chinese physiologists had achieved great achievements in their research work. Here he mentioned research results on the effects of high temperature on various functions of the organism, the effects of the nervous system on tumors, electrophysiological phenomena, and the psychological states of children of different ages. He believes that China attaches great importance to physiological science, especially the research on Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity.
    Astafiev, an Orientalist, is very concerned about China's historical research work and economic research work. He said: "Chinese historians and economists have waged a sharp struggle against idealist ideology and have made irrefutable achievements." He pointed out that China's historical research work has laid a scientific foundation due to the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, thus greatly developing this science. He believes that the achievements in this area are prominently reflected in the works of Guo Moruo, Fan Wenlan, Jian Bozan, and others.
    Their talks all pointed out that although the foundation of Chinese science is generally relatively weak, with the support and care of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, with good working conditions, and with a large number of scientific workers enthusiastically engaged in the scientific cause of the motherland, the development of China's scientific undertaking is very rapid, and it has a very great future; the cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientists is of great significance for the development of the scientific undertakings of the two countries and for defending world peace.
    Finally, Cherkashen, a physiologist who served as the secretary of the delegation, expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the warm reception given to the delegation by the Chinese government and scientific community in his speech.

    苏联科学院代表团离开北京回国
    离京前举行记者招待会发表访华观感
    据新华社讯　苏联科学院代表团结束了在中国的访问，二十三日离开北京分两批返国。
    苏联科学院代表团团长巴尔金院士，团员——别捷赫金院士、科斯琴科院士、塔纳纳耶夫通讯院士、沃罗宁教授和阿斯塔菲耶夫研究员等乘火车返国。到车站欢送的有中国科学院副院长陈伯达、张稼夫、竺可桢、吴有训以及政府各有关部门负责人和在京科学家等八十多人。
    代表团团员——格拉西莫夫院士、别洛乌索夫通讯院士、米舒斯金通讯院士和契尔卡申研究员乘飞机返国。到机场欢送的有中国科学院副院长竺可桢以及政府有关部门负责人和科学家等三十多人。
    代表团离京前夕，中国科学院举行了送别宴会。国务院副总理陈毅和政府有关部门负责人、在京科学家等一百多人出席了宴会。
    新华社二十三日讯　苏联科学院代表团二十二日下午在北京举行记者招待会，发表访华观感。
    苏联科学院代表团团长、苏联科学院副院长巴尔金院士他首先代表全体团员表达了他们在访问中国期间所得到的共同印象。他说：我们在这里看到了中国人民和他们的政府正在尽一切努力把中国的科学事业推向前进；不论是科学部门或工业、经济部门的科学研究工作，规模都很大，工业发展的速度很快，我们看到了许多以前没有的工厂和一些在苏联也少有的新式车间。这位从事科学工作已有四十多年的杰出的冶金学家特别提到了鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂和其他一些新型工厂的名字，他指出这些工厂有着世界上最先进的自动化设备。
    这位曾经两次荣获斯大林奖金的老科学家兴奋地说：我们代表团的团员们感到惊奇的是：中国科学院、政府产业部门以及高等学校的科学研究机构是发展得这样迅速；经费和设备是这样的充足；大批青年正怀着无限热情走上科学工作岗位，他们为了掌握复杂的科学技术，在研究工作中表现了不屈不挠的坚强意志；我们感觉到凡我们所接触的中国科学家和劳动人民在自己国家的建设事业中都发挥了无限的热情。
    巴尔金认为目前中国科学研究工作中的问题是：生物学、农学方面基础较好，但有些科学的基础却很薄弱，例如矿藏的勘探和开采；目前中国科学研究工作中有大批新生力量，但领导研究工作的科学干部则较少。
    地质学家别洛乌索夫通讯院士说：中国正在大规模地进行着的矿产资源和其他自然资源的开发工作正掌握在一批对自己的工作充满了热情的科学家和勘探人员手里。他估计中国在许多地区埋藏着尚未发现的宝贵的矿藏和丰富的自然资源。他说他们代表团中的地学专家已和中国科学家讨论了怎样有计划地开发这些资源的问题。
    微生物学家米舒斯金通讯院士说：中国的微生物研究工作在解放前只限于医学微生物方面，而且力量很小，解放后中国科学家在微生物学方面的研究工作已发展到农业、土壤学和食品工业等方面。他特别提到中国在抗生素研究方面的重大成就，他说中国在医学微生物研究工作中的成就已使中国人民的传染病发病率大大降低。
    化学家塔纳纳耶夫通讯院士说：中国在化学方面的进步是很大的，例如在分析化学方面使用物理化学方法进行分析的研究已有很大的发展；在无机化学方面也进行了理论的和实际应用的研究，例如利用矿物肥料的新方法等，并已应用在工业生产中。
    生理学家沃罗宁教授说：他和生理学家契尔卡申感到中国生理学家在研究工作中得到了很大的成就。这里他提到了关于高温对有机体各种机能的影响、神经系统对瘤肿的影响、电生理学现象、不同年龄儿童的心理状态等方面的研究成果。他认为中国对生理科学是很重视的，特别是对巴甫洛夫高级神经活动学说的研究。
    东方学家阿斯塔菲耶夫很关心中国的历史研究工作和经济学研究工作。他说：中国历史学家和经济学家对唯心主义思想进行了尖锐的斗争，已有了不可辩驳的成就。他指出中国的历史研究工作由于接受了马克思列宁主义思想的指导，已打下了科学的基础，因而使这门科学得到了很大发展，他认为这方面的成就突出地表现在郭沫若、范文澜、翦伯赞等人的著作中。
    他们的谈话都指出：中国科学的基础一般说来虽然比较薄弱，但有着中国共产党与人民政府的支持和关怀，有着良好的工作条件，有着热心地从事祖国科学事业的大批科学工作者，所以中国科学事业的发展是很迅速的，它有着非常伟大的前途；中苏两国科学家的合作对发展两国科学事业，保卫世界和平有重要意义。
    最后，担任代表团秘书的生理学家契尔卡申在谈话中对中国政府和科学界给予代表团的热情招待，表示衷心感谢。
