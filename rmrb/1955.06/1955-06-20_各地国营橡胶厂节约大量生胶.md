    State-Owned Rubber Factories in Various Locations Save Large Amounts of Raw Rubber

    From January to April, state-owned rubber factories across the country saved a total of 207 tons of raw rubber.

    When manufacturing car tires, the State-Owned Rubber Factory No. 1 considered that the cushioning rubber inside the tire was partially wider than necessary, and experimented with narrowing the cushioning rubber, saving raw rubber without affecting the tire quality. For example, tire flaps used to contain 30% raw rubber. Now, reclaimed rubber and recycled waste rubber are used instead, which saves 200 centimeters of raw rubber per flap. State-Owned Rubber Factory No. 4 and State-Owned Rubber Factory No. 8 used to wrap a very long piece of raw rubber around the opening of rubber boots, but these wrappings were completely unnecessary and have now been completely cut off. The middle soles of rubber shoes have a smaller friction surface, and reclaimed rubber is now used instead, saving the original raw rubber. State-Owned Rubber Factory No. 4 alone saved 24 tons of raw rubber from January to April.

    Due to the workers' efforts to improve production technology, rubber factories have not only saved raw rubber, but also other raw materials, such as carbon black, cord fabric, and zinc oxide. From January to April, state-owned rubber factories across the country saved a total of 1,357,700 yuan for the country.

    各地国营橡胶厂节约大量生胶
    全国国营橡胶厂，一月到四月，共节约生胶二百零七吨。
    国营橡胶一厂，在制造汽车轮胎时，考虑到轮胎里的缓冲胶宽出一部分，试验把缓冲胶减窄，节约了生胶，但并不影响轮胎质量。又如轮胎垫带，过去是加进百分之三十的生胶，现在使用再生胶和回收的废胶代替，每条垫带就可以节约二百公分生胶。国营橡胶四厂和国营橡胶八厂过去制造胶靴，都在靴统口包进很长的生胶，而这些包边完全是多余的，现在统统截去。胶鞋的中底摩擦面比较小，现在已经改用再生胶，把原用的生胶节约下来。仅国营橡胶四厂一月到四月就节约了二十四吨生胶。
    由于职工们努力改进生产技术，各橡胶厂不仅节约了生胶，同时还节约了其他原材料，如炭黑、帘子布、氧化锌等。一月到四月，全国国营橡胶厂共为国家节约了一百三十五万七千多元。
