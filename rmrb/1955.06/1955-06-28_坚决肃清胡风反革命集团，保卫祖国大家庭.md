    Resolutely Purge the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique and Defend the Great Family of the Motherland
    Sun Gebaton
    The three batches of materials concerning the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily" have made me shockingly aware that the Hu Feng clique was originally connected to the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret service and was a thorough counter-revolutionary clique. It is extremely infuriating.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Tibetan people have received strong assistance from all fraternal ethnic groups across the country over the past four years. The political, economic, and cultural lives of the Tibetan people are gradually improving, and they are working together to build a new Tibet in the motherland, with the aim of steadily advancing towards a prosperous and happy life. However, the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, disguised as literary and art workers, was hiding in the revolutionary ranks, painstakingly and systematically engaging in counter-revolutionary conspiracies and sabotage activities, attempting to overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship of our country, and undermine our great socialist construction, so that our people of all ethnic groups would once again suffer the trampling of imperialist iron hooves. This is something we hate to the core and absolutely cannot tolerate.
    Now that we have clearly recognized that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is the mortal enemy of our people of all ethnic groups, we must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in order to defend the great socialist cause of the motherland's big family.

    坚决肃清胡风反革命集团，保卫祖国大家庭
    孙格巴顿
    “人民日报”发表的胡风反革命集团的三批材料，使我怵目惊心地认识到胡风集团原来是同美蒋特务机关有联系的，彻头彻尾的反革命集团。令人非常忿恨。
    我们西藏人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，四年来得到全国各兄弟民族人民的大力帮助，西藏人民的政治经济和文化生活正在逐步提高，并正在为建设祖国的新西藏而共同努力，以期稳步前进，达到繁荣幸福的美好生活。可是胡风反革命集团挂着文艺工作者的幌子潜藏在革命队伍里，处心积虑地有组织有计划地从事反革命阴谋破坏活动，妄图推翻我国的人民民主专政的政权，破坏我们伟大的社会主义建设事业，使我们各族人民再度遭受帝国主义铁蹄的践踏。这是我们切齿痛恨而绝对不能容忍的。
    我们既已清楚地认识到胡风反革命集团是我们各族人民的死敌，我们就要坚决把胡风反革命集团彻底消灭，以保卫祖国大家庭的社会主义伟大事业。
