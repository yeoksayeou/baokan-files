Thoroughly Destroy the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
    Sheng Pihua

    After reading the first and second batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, I couldn't suppress the anger in my heart. It turns out that the Hu Feng clique is such an insidious and vicious counter-revolutionary group that is hostile to the people. Once their Marxist-Leninist cloak is stripped away, their faces are so hideous and hateful. They play the two-faced trick of deceiving the people, using the tactic of "Sun Wukong钻进肚皮去 [Sun Wukong (Monkey King) drilling into the stomach]" to undermine the revolution. Undoubtedly, they are enemies of the Party and the people. However, from the first and second batches of materials, their origins were not clear. Although it seemed that they not only wanted to seize the literary and art front, but also had greater ambitions, it was not until the third batch of materials was published that their true form was revealed. They really are not a simple "literary and art" group, but a counter-revolutionary political group under the guise of "literature and art." They have close ties with the imperialist Kuomintang secret service organs, and they hate all people's revolutionary forces like mad dogs. They hate the Communist Party, they hate progressive people, and they are all treated with contempt, abuse and opposition, even to the point of "hating almost everyone."

    This is exactly the face of the loyal lackeys of the imperialist Kuomintang. In the past, some people in our industrial and commercial circles regarded the struggle to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique as merely a matter for the literary and art circles or merely a matter of ideology; after the publication of the third batch of materials, the truth has become clear. Now everyone can see clearly that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a thorough counter-revolutionary clique, and the struggle to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is an important part of our national people's struggle against domestic and foreign enemies.

    The exposure of the counter-revolutionary nature of the Hu Feng clique is a great victory for the people of the whole country. We in the industrial and commercial circles must resolutely participate in the struggle together with the people of the whole country. The old nest of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is in Shanghai, and their destructive activities in Shanghai are very rampant. Therefore, it is even more important for us in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles to carry out the struggle to smash the Hu Feng clique. We must heighten our vigilance, thoroughly investigate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, severely punish those unrepentant chief culprits according to law, and for those Hu Feng elements who have been anesthetized and deceived by Hu Feng, we must make them thoroughly confess, repent, and thoroughly destroy this counter-revolutionary clique. We must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, sincerely accept socialist transformation, and carry out a resolute struggle against all hidden enemies.

    彻底摧毁胡风反革命集团
    盛丕华
    我看了关于揭发胡风反革命集团的第一、第二批材料，无论如何也抑制不住心中的愤怒。原来胡风集团竟是一个如此阴险毒辣同人民为敌的反革命集团。一剥掉他们所披的马克思列宁主义外衣，他们的面目是如此狰狞可恶。他们玩的是欺骗人民的两面派伎俩，用“孙行者钻进肚皮去”的战术来瓦解革命，无疑的他们是党和人民的敌人。不过从第一和第二批材料中，还看不清他们的来历，虽然觉得他们不仅是要夺取文艺阵地，而且有更大的野心，直至公布了第三批材料，才看清了他们的原形。他们果真不是什么简单的“文艺”集团，而是一个以
  “文艺”为幌子的反革命政治集团，他们同帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切联系，他们像疯狗一样仇恨一切人民革命力量。他们仇恨共产党，他们仇恨进步人士，一律加以轻蔑，谩骂和反对，乃至“几乎恨一切人”。
    这正是十足的帝国主义国民党的忠实走狗的嘴脸。过去我们工商界中间还有一些人把粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争，仅仅看作是文艺界的事情或者仅仅认为是思想问题；第三批材料公布后，真相是已经大白了。现在我们每个人都看得清清楚楚，胡风反革命集团是一个彻头彻尾的反革命集团，粉碎胡风反革命集团的斗争是我们全国人民反对国内外敌人斗争的一个重要部分。
    揭露了胡风集团反革命的本质，这是全国人民很大的胜利，我们工商界人士必须和全国人民一起坚决参加到斗争中去。胡风反革命集团的老家是在上海，他们在上海的破坏活动是很猖狂的。因此，我们上海工商界开展粉碎胡风集团的斗争就更其重要。我们必须提高警惕，彻底追查胡风反革命集团，对那些怙恶不悛的首恶分子必须依法严厉惩办，对那些被胡风所麻醉欺骗的胡风分子，则要他们彻底交代、悔悟，把这个反革命集团加以彻底摧毁。我们要更加团结在中国共产党的周围，真诚接受社会主义改造，要同一切隐藏的敌人进行坚决的斗争。
