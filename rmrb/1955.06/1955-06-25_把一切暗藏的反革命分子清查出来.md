Uncover All Hidden Counter-Revolutionaries
廖经天

The ugly and ferocious face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has now been completely exposed, and the people of the whole country can see it clearly. This is a great victory for the people's revolutionary struggle.

For more than twenty years, we have treated Hu Feng and his gang as friends, and regarded their counter-revolutionary activities as ideological errors of our friends, as problems within our own camp. However, things are somewhat strange: after a long period of Marxist study, after the continuous victories of the people's revolution over the past twenty years, and the steady progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation in recent years, the gradual improvement of people's lives and a series of other facts have educated many friends who had erroneous ideas in the past, why have the thoughts of this group of so-called "friends" not progressed at all, and are still stubbornly opposing us? Now things are completely clear: it turns out that they are not our friends, but counter-revolutionaries hidden in the people's ranks. Marxism is a class-based science, a weapon for the proletariat to fight for its own liberation; those who do not stand on the proletariat's position cannot learn it; if they do not abandon their reactionary class stand, the more the people win, the greater the achievements of socialist construction, and the better the people's lives are, the more it will only increase their growing hatred. Enemies who adhere to the reactionary class stand will never accept your education. If the enemy does not surrender, resolutely eliminate it!

The reason why the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has a particularly dangerous and particularly disgusting nature is that it is cloaked in the guise of Marxism and flaunts the banner of progressive artists. It not only drilled into our internal organs to carry out a "heart-digging war," but also used the words and phrases of Marxist-Leninist classics to decorate its reactionary program, which deceived many kind people and poisoned many pure youths. Therefore, today we must not only punish Hu Feng and his gang of die-hard counter-revolutionaries according to law, but also conduct extensive and in-depth ideological education to draw a clear line between ideological boundaries, so as to better eliminate the Hu Feng clique and all other counter-revolutionaries similar to the Hu Feng clique.

Hu Feng's anti-socialist program is fundamentally and completely opposed to Marxism-Leninism, completely opposed to Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and completely in line with the requirements of the reactionary bourgeoisie and counter-revolutionaries. However, because it is disguised with the words and phrases of Marxist-Leninist classics, it can also confuse some petty-bourgeois intellectuals. One of the reasons why this group of petty-bourgeois intellectuals are confused is that their own thinking also has problems. All friends with erroneous ideas must wake up suddenly, truly and practically transform their thinking with Marxism, and resolutely stand on the position of the working class.

Raising vigilance, keeping our eyes open, and clearing out all the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique members and all hidden counter-revolutionaries hidden in the people's ranks is a serious political task for our people across the country today. The existence of all unhealthy thoughts, the low level of Marxist-Leninist theory, the tendency to blindly engage in professional work without asking about politics, and the bureaucratic style of work are all major obstacles to raising vigilance. We must learn from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique incident, use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to eliminate the toxins on our bodies that have paralyzed our nerves for a long time; we must constantly raise vigilance and clear out the Hu Feng clique members and all hidden counter-revolutionaries around us.

    把一切暗藏的反革命分子清查出来
    廖经天
    胡风反革命集团的狰狞丑恶的面目，现在已经完全揭露出来，全国人民都看得清清楚楚了。这是人民革命斗争的一个大胜利。
    二十多年来，我们一直把胡风和他的一伙人当做朋友，把他们的反革命活动当做是自己的朋友们的思想错误，当做是自己阵营内部的问题。但是，事情倒也有些奇怪：经过长期的马克思主义的学习，经过这二十多年来人民革命的不断胜利，这几年来社会主义建设和社会主义改造的着着进展，人民生活的逐渐改善等等一连串的事实的教育，许多过去有错误思想的朋友们都进步了，为什么这一伙所谓“朋友”的思想却丝毫也没有进步，还在死死和我们作对呢？现在事情完全清楚了：原来他们并不是我们的朋友，而是暗藏在人民队伍中的反革命分子。马克思主义是有阶级性的科学，是无产阶级争取自身解放斗争的武器，不站在无产阶级立场上的人就学不进去；如果他不抛弃反动的阶级立场，人民越胜利，社会主义建设的成绩越大，人民的生活过得越好，只有增加他越来越深的仇恨。坚持反动阶级立场的敌人，决不会接受你的教育。敌人，如果不投降，就坚决消灭它！
    胡风反革命集团所以具有特别危险、特别令人憎恶的性质，就在于它披着马克思主义的外衣，打着进步文艺家的幌子，不但钻进了我们肝脏里来进行“挖心战”，而且它以马克思列宁主义经典著作中的辞句装饰起来的反动纲领，还欺骗了许多善良的人们，毒害了许多纯洁的青年。所以我们今天不但要把胡风和他的一伙死不改悔的反革命分子依法惩办，而且还要广泛深入地进行思想教育，划清思想界限，才能更好地肃清胡风集团及其他一切类似胡风集团的反革命分子。
    胡风的反社会主义纲领是从根本上完全同马克思列宁主义站在敌对地位的，是同毛泽东同志的文艺思想完全敌对的，是完全符合反动资产阶级反革命的要求的。但是，由于它用马克思列宁主义经典著作的辞句伪装起来，所以它也能迷惑一部分小资产阶级知识分子。这部分小资产阶级知识分子被迷惑的原因之一，就是他们自己的思想上也有毛病。所有有错误思想的朋友们，必须猛然惊醒，切切实实用马克思主义来改造自己的思想，坚决站到工人阶级的立场上来。
    提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，把暗藏在人民队伍里边的胡风反革命集团分子及一切反革命分子全部清查出来，清除出去，是我们全国人民当前的一个严重的政治任务。一切不健康的思想的存在，马克思列宁主义理论水平的低下，盲目搞业务不问政治的倾向和官僚主义作风，都是提高警惕性的重大障碍。我们必须从胡风反革命集团的事件中吸取教训，用批评和自我批评的武器，肃清我们肌体上长期以来麻痹了我们的神经的毒菌；要不断提高警惕性，把周围的胡风集团分子和一切暗藏的反革命分子清查出来。
