The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of leading personnel from factories and enterprises throughout the city on June 8th to mobilize all factories and enterprises to further launch a comprehensive thrift campaign.

In the past, Shanghai's factories and enterprises have made certain achievements in conservation. For example, cotton textile factories have universally reduced cotton consumption per yarn unit by paying attention to saving cotton. In the first quarter of this year, state-owned cotton textile factories have reduced their average cotton consumption per yarn unit from 394 jin in 1954 to 386 jin. Private cotton textile factories have also reduced it from 394.28 jin to 389.88 jin. This year, four state-owned oil factories produced 680,000 jin more edible oil with the same raw materials compared to 1954. Many light industrial and chemical factories have paid attention to promoting substitutes. Many factories have also made considerable achievements in saving electricity and coal. However, the development of thrift work in Shanghai's factories and enterprises is still very uneven, and there is still great production potential. Waste is still quite common and serious. For example, some cotton textile factories have reduced cotton consumption per yarn unit to 386 jin, but some factories still consume more than 392 jin. After the staff and workers of the jointly owned Da Fu Rubber Factory promoted the "dug-out skin" conservation method, they could save enough rubber for one pair of shoes for every twenty-four pairs of rubber shoes produced. If this method is universally promoted throughout the city, 100 tons of rubber can be saved in a year, but some factories are still unwilling to promote it.

In response to these situations, Ma Tianshui, Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, requested at the meeting that Shanghai's factories and enterprises further deepen the comprehensive thrift campaign. He emphasized that the thrift campaign must be combined with improving product quality and improving enterprise management. He also proposed that private factories and small factories should also participate in the thrift campaign. All factories and enterprises must oppose all wasteful phenomena, and pay special attention to opposing the waste of food.

### 上海市委动员工厂企业开展全面节约运动

    上海市委动员工厂企业开展全面节约运动
    中共上海市委员会在六月八日召开了全市工厂企业负责人员会议，动员全市工厂企业进一步开展全面性的节约运动。
  上海市各工厂企业过去已在节约方面作出一定成绩。例如，棉纺织各厂由于注意节约用棉，每件棉纱的用棉量已经普遍下降。国营各棉纺织厂今年第一季度每件纱的用棉量已经从一九五四年的三百九十四市斤平均下降到三百八十六市斤。私营各棉纺织厂也从三百九十四点二八市斤下降到三百八十九点八八市斤。四个国营油脂厂今年用同样的原料比一九五四年多生产了六十八万斤食油。不少轻工业工厂和化工工厂注意推广了代用品。许多工厂在节约用电、节约用煤方面也取得不少成绩。但是上海市工厂企业的节约工作开展得还很不平衡，生产潜力还很大。浪费情况还相当普遍和严重，如有的棉纺织厂每件纱的用棉量已经下降到三百八十六市斤，但是有的厂用棉量还在三百九十二市斤以上。公私合营大浮橡胶厂职工推广“挖口皮”的节约办法以后，每生产二十四双胶鞋可以节省一双鞋的橡胶。这个办法如在全市普遍推广，一年就可节约一百吨橡胶，但是有的厂至今还不愿意推广。
    针对这些情况，中共上海市委副书记马天水在会议上要求上海市各工厂企业进一步深入开展全面性的节约运动。他强调指出，节约运动必须和提高产品质量、提高企业管理水平相结合。他并且提出，私营厂和小厂也应当参加节约运动，各工厂企业必须反对一切浪费现象，特别要注意反对浪费粮食。　　　　　（本报驻上海记者）
