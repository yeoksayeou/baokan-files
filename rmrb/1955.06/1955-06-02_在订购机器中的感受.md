    Feelings on Ordering Machines
    Ji Ge, Deputy Director of the Machine Tool Division of the China National Machinery Import Corporation

    Czechoslovakia's industry is highly developed, especially in machine manufacturing. Besides supplying domestic needs, it can also export a large quantity. Over the past few years, Czechoslovakia has supplied China with a large number of machines. There are more than two hundred types of metal cutting machine tools, forging equipment, and woodworking machinery alone. Many of these machine tools are equipped with advanced electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic transmissions and automatic loading equipment. With these devices, labor productivity has been greatly improved.

    During the ordering negotiations, we felt the fraternal country's meticulous help everywhere. In order to make the supplied machine tools suitable for China's needs, they sent experts and our ordering personnel to their factory workshops to study together and specially designed and manufactured machine tools for China. They also specially translated many Chinese samples for us. They told us not to buy things that were not necessary. For example, when we ordered universal milling machines in 1953, we ordered a universal milling head and a vertical milling head as accessories. After the Czechoslovakian representative learned about it, he told us that it was not necessary to buy a vertical milling head, and the universal milling head could be used instead. Sometimes, even after the contract was officially signed, but the cost of manufacturing the machine was reduced, they would take the initiative to return the overcharged money to us. Taking 1954 as an example, they returned several million yuan to us.

    After the machine tools were shipped to China, they often learned about the use of the machine tools through the representatives of the Commercial Counselor's Office in China and sent us many technical instructions. When encountering special difficulties, they also sent experts to Chinese factories to provide specific help. For example, in 1953, six experts were sent to work in Tianjin, Shanghai and other places.

    After the Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia opened in Beijing, six experts introduced the exhibits to the merchandisers of our company. The experts sacrificed their rest time, and some even explained to us while sick. After the exhibition closed, they specially explained the performance of the machines to the merchandisers of our First Division. During the exhibition, the heavy-duty lathe of our Dalian Shipyard had technical problems in installation, and the OKH35 gear milling machine of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant also had operational difficulties. After experts Manwora and Saint Dora learned about it, they took the time to go to the site to assist in solving the problems. Machine tool expert Majkus, milling machine expert Manwora, electrical expert Radik, automatic lathe expert Rabernisek and hydraulic press expert Marelik are preparing to go to industrial cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, and Tianjin to explain the structure, performance, and operation of machine tools to the workers of our machine and motor manufacturing factories. Czechoslovakia's selfless support and assistance has played a certain role in China's first five-year construction plan. We sincerely thank you for this help.

    在订购机器中的感受
    中国机械进口公司机床工具处副处长　吉戈
    捷克斯洛伐克工业很发达，特别在机器制造业方面，除了供应国内需要外，还可以大量出口。几年来，捷克斯洛伐克供应了我国大批的机器。仅金属切削机床、锻压设备及木工机械就有二百多种。这些机床有不少都装有先进的电气、油压、气压传动及上料等自动装备，有了这些设备，大大提高了劳动生产效率。
    在订货谈判中，我们处处感到兄弟国家对我们无微不至的帮助。为了使供应机床适合我国的需要，他们派专家和我国订货人员到他们工厂的车间一同研究，并专门为我国设计制造机床。他们还专门为我们翻译了很多中文样本。不必要买的东西，他们就告诉我们不要买。如一九五三年我们在订购万能铣床时，在附属设备中订了万能铣头，又订了立式铣头。捷克斯洛伐克代表知道后就对我们说，不必买立式铣头，用万能铣头代替就可以了。有时合同已经正式签订了，但机器制造出来，成本降低了，他们就主动的将多收的钱退给我们。拿一九五四年来说，他们就退给我们数百万元。
    机床运到我国后，他们通过驻我国商务参赞处的代表经常了解机床的使用情况，并寄给我们许多技术说明。碰到特殊的困难问题，还派专家来我国工厂具体帮助。如一九五三年就曾派了六位专家到天津、上海等地工作。
    捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会在北京开幕后，有六位专家给我们公司的商品员介绍展品，专家牺牲休息时间，有的甚至带病给我们讲解。展览会闭幕后，又专门为我们第一处的商品员讲解机器性能。展览会期间，我们大连造船厂的重型车床在安装上发生了技术问题，沈阳重型机器厂的OKH35型铣齿机在操作上也发生了困难，专家曼渥拉及圣道拉同志知道后，就抽空赶到现场去协助解决。工具机专家玛伊库斯、铣床专家曼渥拉、电气专家拉第克、自动车床专家拉伯尼斯克和水压机专家玛热利克五位同志准备前往沈阳、哈尔滨、天津等工业城市，给我们的机器和电机制造工厂的职工讲解机床构造、性能和操作。捷克斯洛伐克的这种无私的支援和帮助，对我国第一个五年建设计划起一定作用。我们衷心地感谢这种帮助。
