    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 6th: On the eve of the start of negotiations for the normalization of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Japan Council for the Protection of Peace and the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association issued statements on this issue.
    The statement of the Japan Council for the Protection of Peace pointed out that the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union would ease international tensions, conform to the interests of the Japanese people, and be conducive to Japan's independence and the development of a peaceful economy. The people of Japan all over the country expect the resumption of diplomatic negotiations to be successful.
    The Peace Council requested the Japanese government to: negotiate with the Soviet Union independently; the purpose of the negotiations should not be limited to establishing official relations, but also to establishing peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries; first restore diplomatic relations between the two countries, and then negotiate and resolve specific issues between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
    The statement of the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association also called on the Japanese government to adopt a peaceful, friendly, and independent attitude in negotiations with the Soviet Union. The statement pointed out that the Japanese government showed concern for the United States on the negotiation issue, and demanded that the Japanese government not impose preconditions for the resumption of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, because this would only delay the resumption of diplomatic relations and the resolution of outstanding issues between the two countries.
    The Japan-Soviet Friendship Association stated that it would launch a mass movement to realize the above requirements.

    日本拥护和平委员会和日苏亲善协会分别发表声明表示
    日本人民期待恢复日苏邦交谈判能够成功
    新华社六日讯　东京消息：日本拥护和平委员会和日苏亲善协会，在日苏两国关系正常化的谈判开始前夕，曾经分别就这个问题发表了声明。
    日本拥护和平委员会的声明指出：日苏邦交的正常化将会缓和国际紧张局势，符合于日本人民的利益，有利于日本的独立和和平经济的发展。日本全国人民都期待恢复邦交谈判能够成功。
    和平委员会要求日本政府：自主地同苏联进行谈判；谈判的目的不应限于建立事务上的关系，而且要建立两国间的和平友好关系；首先恢复两国邦交，然后根据平等、互利的原则协商解决两国间悬而未决的具体问题。
    日苏亲善协会的声明也要求日本政府在同苏联的谈判中，采取和平、友好、自主的态度。声明指出日本政府在谈判问题上表现出对美国有所顾虑，并且要求日本政府不要对恢复日苏邦交提出先决条件，因为这样只有使恢复邦交和解决两国间悬而未决的问题拖延下去。
    日苏亲善协会表示，它将展开群众运动来使上述要求实现。
