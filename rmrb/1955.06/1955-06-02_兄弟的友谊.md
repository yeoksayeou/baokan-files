    The Friendship of Brothers
    Liu Renxu, First Deputy Director of Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant
    We have long known that Czechoslovakia's mechanical industry is relatively developed. After visiting the Exhibition of Achievements in Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia, we further understood that in the past ten years, thanks to the help of the great Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia's industry and technology, especially the mechanical industry and technology, have progressed extremely rapidly.
    The workers and technicians of our factory have visited the exhibition several times. We saw that the machine tools made in Czechoslovakia are very exquisite and beautiful. The machines run with very little noise, and the operation is very flexible and convenient. There are many unique features in the design.
    During the exhibition, we listened to a lecture by Engineer Majkus, a Czechoslovak expert in working machine tools. He told us that in order to rapidly develop the machine tool industry, Czechoslovakia has its own machine tool design and process research institute. This institute has done a lot of work in improving machine tool efficiency, economy, processing accuracy, vibration resistance, and shortening auxiliary time. We know that Czechoslovak machine tool products are being improved day by day with new and higher technology. Every year's products are more sophisticated than the previous year. This is the result of the close combination of scientific research institutions and industrial production.
    Czechoslovak machine tools are very popular and loved by the workers in our factory. However, because we lack technical knowledge, the usage is not very good. The machining workshop of our factory has a Czechoslovak gantry planer, and the electrical part has a problem. We don't understand the principle of this machine, and the adjustment method is not very clear. We repaired it several times, but it was not completely repaired. We told the Czechoslovak expert about this situation. At that time, the exhibition had not yet opened, and it was in a stage of intense machine installation. We estimated that the expert could not come to the factory, so we only asked him to give us some oral guidance. Who knew that after the expert heard about it, he was afraid of delaying our production and rushed to our factory early the next morning. The expert arrived at the factory, went to the workshop, rolled up his sleeves, and repaired it himself, explaining as he repaired, until after two o'clock in the afternoon before eating. After the meal, he rushed to adjust it again. At five o'clock, he was still unwilling to leave and wanted to systematically explain the principle of the machine tool to our workers and technicians. After the exhibition closed, Czechoslovak experts Kosak and Vasak also came to our factory to personally guide us in the installation of the GV201 high-frequency induction furnace, all the way to the test run, and set the operating procedures. The enthusiastic help of the Czechoslovak experts gave our workers and technicians a new internationalist education.
    Now the exhibition is over, but the rapid development of the Czechoslovak machine manufacturing industry that we have witnessed will inspire the labor enthusiasm and confidence of the workers in China's machine manufacturing industry for a long time. May the friendship between us and our Czechoslovak worker brothers continue to develop and consolidate in peaceful labor.

    兄弟的友谊
    北京第一机床厂第一副厂长  刘任需
    我们早就知道，捷克斯洛伐克的机械工业是比较发达的。参观了捷克斯洛伐克十年社会主义建设成就展览会以后，我们进一步了解到，十年来，由于伟大苏联的帮助，捷克斯洛伐克的工业和技术、尤其是机械工业和技术的进步是极为迅速的。
    我们工厂的工人和技术员曾经几次参观了展览会。我们看到，捷克斯洛伐克的机床做得都是非常精致、美观，机器在运转当中声音非常小，操纵都很灵活方便。设计上有很多独到的地方。
    展览会展出期间，我们曾听了捷克斯洛伐克工作母机专家玛依库斯工程师的讲演。他告诉我们，为了使机床工业得到迅速发展，捷克斯洛伐克有自己的机床设计和工艺研究院。这个研究院在提高机床效率、经济性、加工精度、抗震坚度和缩短辅助时间等方面，已做了不少工作。我们知道，捷克斯洛伐克的机床产品，正日新月异地用新的、更高的技术在改进着，每年的产品都比前一年更精巧，这是科学研究机关和工业生产密切结合的结果。
    捷克斯洛伐克机床在我们厂里是非常受到工人们的欢迎和热爱的。但因为我们缺乏技术知识，使用情况并不良好。我厂加工车间有部捷克斯洛伐克龙门刨床，电气部分发生了毛病，我们不懂这部床子的原理，调整方法不太清楚，修理了好几次，也没彻底修好。我们就把这情况告诉了捷克斯洛伐克专家。那时展览会还没开幕，正在紧张安装机器的阶段，我们估计专家不可能下厂，因此只要求他给我们一些口头的指导。谁知专家听了以后，生怕耽误了我们的生产，第二天一早就赶到我们厂里来了。专家来到厂里，就下车间去，挽起袖子，亲自动手修理，边修边讲，一直到下午两点多钟才吃饭。饭后又赶来调整，到了五点多钟，还不肯走，还要系统的为我们的工人和技术人员讲解机床原理。展览会闭幕以后，捷克斯洛伐克专家柯萨克和瓦萨奇还来到我们厂里亲自指导我们安装GV201型高周波电炉，一直到试车，订出操作规程。捷克斯洛伐克专家对我们的热情帮助，使我们的工人和技术人员受到了一次新的国际主义教育。
    现在展览会结束了，但我们亲眼看到的捷克斯洛伐克机器制造工业的飞跃发展的情景，将会长时期的鼓舞着我们中国机器制造业的工人的劳动热情和信心。愿我们和捷克斯洛伐克工人兄弟的友谊，在和平劳动中不断发展和巩固。
