Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Following the rectification of grain unified purchase and supply work in rural areas, various cities have also put the rectification of grain unified purchase and supply work on the agenda. Cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Nanjing have successively adopted preliminary rectification measures. Before taking these measures, various cities launched a grain saving campaign in March and April. Statistics from the Ministry of Food show that the blind exceeding of the state plan in urban grain sales in the eight months before April was not significantly changed in this movement. In May, the grain sales of 240 large and medium-sized cities nationwide decreased by only 110 million catties compared with April. This does not mean that there is no waste of grain in the cities. As reported by local newspapers, the phenomenon of wasting grain in cities is very serious. Many organizations and groups falsely report the population and fraudulently claim grain. From September last year to April this year, the rate of increase in grain sales in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and other cities exceeded the rate of population increase by more than double.

Currently, several large cities have taken preliminary measures to rectify the work of unified grain purchase and supply, and have strengthened the management of planned supply. In Shanghai, 10,000 catering units, including factories, schools, government agencies, and organizations, as well as industries using grain as raw materials, have all prepared grain purchase plans. After residents formulated grain purchase plans, more than 1.3 million new grain purchase certificates have been issued to residents. From June, units such as government agencies, organizations, schools, and factories in Beijing have implemented a strict system of pre-budgeting and final accounting for grain supply. The grain demand plans declared by more than 3,000 collective catering units have been carefully calculated and carefully reviewed by the heads of the agencies and units. When submitting their grain consumption plans for June, all catering groups first verified the number of people and cleared their grain inventory. The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee passed a temporary method for preliminary improvement of grain unified purchase and supply work. The method stipulates that in the future, planned supply will be implemented after verification based on the actual needs of each household. This method has already been implemented. Twelve medium-sized and small cities, including Nanjing, Changzhou, Xuzhou, and Hangzhou, have generally begun to improve the work of unified grain purchase and supply. Most collective catering units have formulated plans to save grain. More than 8,000 government employees in Hangzhou assisted 120,000 households in formulating grain purchase plans. Simultaneously with these measures, publicity and education work for residents is also being carried out. In Shenyang, about 10,000 government employees conducted publicity activities among residents. In Wuhan, more than 1,000 government employees cooperated with residents' committees and street activists to carry out in-depth education work. The work of educating residents to save grain in Shanghai is carried out by work teams in each district.

    各城市开始整顿粮食统销工作
    新华社二十日讯　继农村整顿粮食统销工作以后，各城市也把整顿粮食统销工作提到日程上来了。北京、上海、沈阳、武汉、南京等城市已相继采取初步的整顿措施。在采取这些措施以前，各城市三、四月间就开展了节约粮食运动。粮食部的统计标明，四月份以前的八个月内城市粮食销售盲目突破国家计划的情况，在这个运动中没有得到显著改变，五月份全国二百四十个大、中城市的粮食销售量比四月份只减少了一亿一千万斤。这并不是城市没有浪费粮食，如各地报纸报道，城市浪费粮食的现象十分严重。不少机关、团体虚报人口，冒领粮食。北京、天津、上海等市从去年九月到今年四月的八个月中，粮食销售增加的速度超过人口增加速度的一倍多。
    目前，几个大城市为整顿粮食统销工作采取了初步措施，加强了计划供应的管理工作。上海市全市工厂、学校、机关、团体等一万个伙食单位以及以粮食为原料的行业，都编制了购粮计划。在居民订出购粮计划后，一百三十多万份新购粮证已发到居民手中。北京市机关、团体、学校、厂矿等单位从六月份起实行严格的粮食供应预决算制度，三千多个集体伙食单位申报的需粮计划，都经过仔细计算，并由机关单位负责人认真审核。各伙食团在提报六月份用粮计划时，首先核实人数，清理了粮食库存。武汉市人民委员会通过了一个初步改进粮食统销工作的暂行办法。办法规定，今后将按每户实际需要，经过核实后，实行计划供应。这个办法已经开始实行。南京、常州、徐州、杭州等十二个中、小城市普遍开始改进粮食统销工作，多数集体伙食单位订出了节约用粮计划。杭州市八千多名机关工作人员协助十二万户居民订出了购粮计划。和采取这些措施同时，对居民的宣传教育工作也在展开。沈阳市约有一万名机关工作人员在居民中进行了宣传活动。武汉市一千多个机关工作人员配合居民委员会和街道积极分子，展开了深入的教育工作。上海市教育居民节约粮食的工作，是由各区工作队进行的。
