How Taigu County Rectified Rural Grain Unified Sales Work
Zhang Lianjiang

According to the instructions of the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on intensifying the rectification of grain unified sales work, Taigu County, Shanxi Province, carried out the rectification of rural grain unified sales work from April 25th to May 15th. After this rectification, the unreasonable grain supply situation and "tension" in rural areas were eliminated, and the farmers' production mood was stabilized. According to statistics from 25 townships including Chaoyang, the original supply coverage rate of 42.6% was reduced to 29%; the largest supply coverage rate decreased from the original 80% to 40%. According to the situation in the previous period, it was necessary to exceed the supply plan; now, the supply problem of grain-deficient households can be solved without increasing the supply amount at all.

	Clear Head, Unified Understanding

From January to June, Taigu County supplied more than 2.5 million jin of grain to rural areas. If we calculate that grain-deficient farmers lack grain for an average of three months and each person is supplied with 90 jin of grain, it can supply more than 27,000 people, accounting for 24% of the total agricultural population of the county. It can be seen that the grain supplied by the state to rural areas is sufficient to supply grain-deficient households. However, in the previous stage, the county party committee overestimated the grain shortage area in rural areas and blindly believed in certain staff members at the grassroots level who said "last year's disaster" and "too heavy unified purchase", etc., so the lower levels wanted to give it once and increase the supply up to four times. As a result, the farmers believed that the state's grain supply was "as much as you want"; the village staff also believed that "the county has grain to ask for," and thus abandoned the ideological education work for the masses. The farmers shouted, the staff wanted, and as a result, more and more "grain-deficient households" who were actually not short of grain, and the supply increased more and more, wasting the state's grain. If the unreasonable part of the total supply is calculated at 20%, the county wasted more than 500,000 jin of grain.

Before the start of this rectification of the unified sales work, the county party committee first studied the instructions of the higher authorities and realized that the "tension" in the rural "grain shortage" was mainly caused by the failure of the work. Then, a meeting of the leaders of the work groups in each township was held. At the meeting, the county party committee reviewed the shortcomings in the unified sales work and analyzed the grain situation in the county. The comrades who attended the meeting unanimously realized that it was not that there was less grain, but that the supply was unreasonable, and they were determined to rectify the grain supply work. After the work group for rectifying the grain unified sales entered the townships, it relied on the party branches, and after analysis and calculation, unified the thinking of party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and grassroots cadres, reversed their idea of reaching out to the state for grain, and carried out the work in the spirit of ensuring supply under the principle of saving grain. In this way, the rectification of rural grain unified sales work was successfully completed in a short period of time.

	Settle the Accounts, Find out the Facts

In the previous stage, many township work groups and village staff could not settle the accounts, which led to the phenomenon of wanting grain even when there was grain, only looking at the indicators and not at the inventory, and constantly asking the county to add to the supply. To this end, while convening the work group leaders' meeting, the county party committee convened a meeting of the directors and accountants of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to settle the accounts with the grain bureau and find out the facts of the inventory. In this way, the work groups and grassroots staff knew exactly what was going on, realized that the grain shortage time was short and the inventory of grain was sufficient, which not only enhanced their confidence in doing a good job in rectifying the unified sales work, but also saved the state's grain by settling the accounts and clearing the inventory. For example, the supply target for Baicheng Township from January to June was 75,090 jin, but only 42,342 jin were supplied from January to April, and 32,748 jin were still stored in the warehouse. After mastering this situation, after rectification, it was determined that another 17,014 jin would be supplied until the wheat harvest, and more than 15,000 jin of grain could be returned to the state's inventory. At the same time, it also cleared out that the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives generally had some "black grain", such as the Chaoyang Township supply and marketing cooperative clearing out 5,469 jin, and the Baicheng Township also clearing out 3,998 jin. As a result of this rectification, 11 townships including Fancun returned a total of 250,000 jin of unreasonably supplied grain, which was supplemented to 15 townships including Zhujiabao with insufficient supply, achieving a balance of income and expenditure and complete self-sufficiency in the county.

	Classify Types, Clarify Guidelines

The county party committee first further analyzed the situation of each township and determined to take production as the center and do a good job in rectifying the unified sales work. In terms of practice, the county party committee classified each township into three types according to their different situations: The first type was those that had undergone preliminary rectification and whose mood of the masses was normal, such as 17 townships including Chaoyang, and it was determined to focus on doing a good job in production and periodically end the rectification of the unified sales work. The second type was those that had not undergone rectification but whose mood of the masses was relatively normal, such as 24 townships including Beikang, and it was decided to adopt the policy of rectifying unified sales with production as the center. The third type was those with chaotic grain supply and abnormal mood of the masses, which seriously affected production, such as 13 townships including Shuiqiao, and it was decided to focus on rectifying unified sales while doing a good job in production. After the work groups went down, they classified the different situations of each village, classified them by type, and assigned special personnel to be responsible for the rectification. In this way, the balanced development of the work was guaranteed, and all townships except for four townships including Dunfang ended the rectification of the unified sales work on May 20th, while the rest ended on May 15th.

On the basis of mastering the situation of each township, the county party committee put forward requirements to each township separately, announcing which townships should be self-sufficient within the supply target, which townships should return how much from the over-supplied part, and which townships could increase the supply target by how much. The advantage of doing this is that the county party committee knows exactly what is going on, and the work groups and grassroots staff can also understand the supply situation of the county, and the illusion of "how much can be given by the county" will not occur again.

	Clean Hands and Feet, Justified and Confident

The reason why the farmers' grain seemed so "tight" in the previous period was inseparable from the fact that some grassroots staff members, party members, and members of the Communist Youth League engaged in malpractice for personal gain and had unclean hands and feet. They bought more grain themselves or "took care" of relatives and neighbors, so they felt soft-spoken and unjustified, and dared not persuade the masses. It is understood that in Zhujiabao Township, 14 party members and members of the Communist Youth League were supplied even though they were not short of grain; Bai Quanrong, the director of the Beikang Township supply and marketing cooperative, supplied 600 jin to his uncle who was a rich peasant; Bai Yunlin, the brother of deputy township chief Bai Yunxiang, was supplied 300 jin even though he was not short of grain. Individual grassroots staff members themselves took the "leading role" in making a big fuss about "grain shortage". For example, Guo Songlin and Jia Peishu, staff members of Jiajiabao Township, were not short of grain, but they shouted "it must be supplied" among the masses. As a result, more than 80% of the farmers in the township requested supply.

From these situations, it seems that rectifying the grain supply of party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and grassroots staff is a prerequisite for reversing the unreasonable phenomenon in grain supply. Therefore, the work groups in each township convened meetings of party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and grassroots staff, and first rectified the grain supply to them. In Chaoyang Township, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and staff members were organized to study the instructions of the Central Committee and conduct self-criticism in light of the actual situation. The township women's federation chairman, deputy township chief, and production committee member took the initiative to admit to the masses that they should not have been supplied and bought more grain, and automatically returned 600 jin of supplied grain on the spot. When the masses saw them doing this, they knew that they could not fool them anymore, so they all reported the actual number of grain shortages. This township originally requested an increase in the supply of 20,000 jin, but not only did it not increase, it returned 15,000 jin of grain to the state.

	Rely on Poor Peasants, Unite with Middle Peasants

The fundamental shortcoming in the grain unified sales work in Taigu County in the past was that it did not implement the Party's class line in rural work very well. Poor peasants supported the policy of unified purchase and unified sales the most, but in the unified sales work, their advantages were not established. Middle peasants had concerns about the Party's policy of unified purchase and unified sales, and they contacted the staff very closely, so they pretended to be "grain-deficient". Among the more than 30 people in Beidun Village who contacted the staff to request supply, only two were poor peasants, and the rest were middle peasants. They strongly advocated "the supply coverage should be broadened, even if the amount is less", the purpose was to hang a "grain-deficient household" "brand" to make the government feel that there was no grain to buy. Under this circumstance, rich peasants and counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to spread rumors, even beat up staff members, and openly carry out sabotage. Grassroots staff members did not analyze problems from a class point of view, did not find a reliance, "dancing with bare hands", could not distinguish the boundary between surplus and deficiency, were deceived by superficial phenomena, and thought that "whoever comes to ask for it and makes trouble is a grain-deficient household", so they did not cherish the state's grain and supplied it casually. In the previous stage, the supply coverage of Zhujiabao Township had reached 67%, but the staff still felt that the problem had not been solved. Bai Quanrong, the director of the Beikang Township supply and marketing cooperative, secretly took grain from the warehouse and supplied it to whoever contacted him closely. Peasant Zhi Guidan was not short of grain, but he was issued a supply certificate; when he returned the certificate, the staff asked him: "Are you really not short?"

To correct the unreasonable supply, ensure the supply of truly grain-deficient households, and make the rural grain unified sales reasonable, it is necessary to implement the Party's class line in rural work and fully mobilize the masses. In this rectification of unified sales work, the work groups in Taigu Township relied on poor peasants to find out the situation of surplus and deficiency, explained the policies to poor and middle peasants, mobilized poor and middle peasants to discuss ways to reasonably solve the grain problem, and cracked down on the sabotage activities of rich peasants and counter-revolutionaries. After mass discussion and rectification of unreasonable supply, the mood of the masses stabilized, the supply coverage narrowed, the supply became reasonable, and grain was saved. For example, the supply coverage of Zhujiabao Township decreased from the original 67% to 32%; the supply coverage of Beiguo Township decreased from the original 43% to 20.8%. These facts fully illustrate that the grain supplied by the state to rural areas is sufficient; many farmers say that they are "short of grain" because the work is not done well, the supply is unreasonable, and the masses have concerns; as long as the masses are relied on to find out the situation, the indicators are announced to the masses, political education work is done well, and democratic appraisal by the masses is relied on, the grain unified sales work can be done well without breaking through the original supply plan.

    太谷县怎样整顿好了农村粮食统销工作
    张连江
    根据国务院和中共中央关于加紧整顿粮食统销工作的指示，山西省太谷县从四月二十五日到五月十五日，进行了整顿农村粮食统销的工作。经过这次整顿，消除了农村粮食供应不合理和“紧张”的情况，稳定了农民的生产情绪。根据朝阳等二十五个乡的统计，原来供应面达百分之四十二点六，现在降低到百分之二十九；其中供应面最大的由原来的百分之八十降到百分之四十。按照前一个时期的情况来看，势必要突破供应计划；现在，不必增加一点供应数就可以解决缺粮户的供应问题了。
      清醒头脑，统一认识
    太谷县一月份至六月份供应农村的粮食，共达二百五十万多斤。如以缺粮农民平均缺粮三个月、每人供应九十斤粮食来计算，可以供应二万七千余人，占全县农业人口总数的百分之二十四。由此可见，国家供应给农村的粮食是足够供应缺粮户的。但是，在前一阶段，县委对农村的缺粮面估计过大，盲目听信基层某工作人员乱说“去年受灾”“统购太重”等等，因而下边要一次就给一次，增加供应达四次之多。这样，就使农民认为国家的粮食供应是“要多少有多少”；乡村工作人员也认为“县里有粮可要”，因而放弃了对群众的思想教育工作。农民群众喊，工作人员要，结果，实际上不缺粮的“缺粮户”越来越多，供应越来越增加，浪费了国家的粮食。全部供应量中不合理的部分如以百分之二十计算，全县浪费的粮食就在五十万斤以上。
  这次整顿统销工作开始以前，县委首先学习了上级的指示，认识到农村“缺粮”的“紧张”空气，主要是因为工作没作好而造成的。然后，召开了各乡工作组长会议。在会议上，县委检查了统销工作中的缺点，分析了全县的粮食情况。到会的同志一致认识到，不是粮食少，而是供应不合理，决心把粮食供应工作整顿好。整顿粮食统销的工作组入乡后，依靠党的支部，经过分析、算帐，统一了党员团员和基层干部的思想，扭转了他们伸手向国家要粮食的想法，本着在节约粮食的原则下保证供应的精神进行工作。这样，在短时间内就顺利地完成了整顿农村粮食统销的工作。
    算清帐目，摸清底子
    前一阶段，有许多乡的工作组和乡村工作人员算不清帐，以致形成了有粮还要粮，光看指标不看库存，一直要求县里追加供应的现象。为此，县委在召开工作组长会议的同时，召开了基层供销社主任和会计会议，同粮食局算清帐目，摸清了库存的底子。这样，工作组和基层工作人员做到了心中有数，认识到缺粮时间已短、库存粮食够用，不但增强了做好整顿统销工作的信心，而且通过算帐清库，给国家节约了粮食。如白城乡一月份至六月份的供应指标是七万五千零九十斤，一月份至四月份只供应出四万二千三百四十二斤，库内还存有三万二千七百四十八斤。掌握了这个情况以后，经过整顿，确定到麦收再供应一万七千零一十四斤，可以交回国家库存粮食一万五千多斤。同时，还清理出基层供销社普遍存有若干“黑粮”，如朝阳乡供销社清理出五千四百六十九斤，白城乡也清理出三千九百九十八斤。这样整顿的结果，范村等十一个乡共交回供应不合理的粮食二十五万斤，补给了朱家堡等十五个供应不足的乡，做到了全县收支平衡，全部自给。
      划分类型，明确方针
    县委首先对各乡的情况进一步进行了分析，并确定以生产为中心，做好整顿统销工作。在做法上，根据各乡的不同情况，划分为三种类型：第一类是已经经过初步整顿，群众情绪正常的，如朝阳等十七个乡，确定以搞好生产为主，定期结束整顿统销工作。第二类是没有经过整顿，但群众情绪比较正常的，如北洸等二十四个乡，采取以生产为中心整顿统销的方针。第三类是粮食供应混乱，群众情绪不正常，严重影响生产的，如水乔等十三个乡，以整顿统销为重点，同时搞好生产。工作组下去以后，根据各村的不同情况，分别类型，分别指定专人负责进行整顿。这样，保证了工作的平衡发展，全县除敦坊等四个乡的整顿统销工作是在五月二十日结束外，其余各乡都是在十五日结束的。
    县委在掌握了各乡情况的基础上，向各乡分别提出要求，宣布哪些乡应在供应指标内自给，哪些乡应从多供应的部分交回多少，哪些乡可再增加供应指标多少。这样做的好处是：县委心中有数，工作组和基层工作人员也都可以摸清全县供应的底子，不会再发生“向县里要多少可以给多少”的错觉了。
      洗净手脚，理直气壮
    前一时期农民的粮食显得那样“紧”，是同部分基层工作人员、党员、团员徇私舞弊、手脚不干净分不开的。他们自己多买了粮食，或者“照顾”了亲朋邻舍，所以就觉得嘴软理短，不敢去说服群众。据了解，朱家堡乡就有十四个党员团员不缺粮食也供应了；北洸乡供销社主任白全荣的姑夫是富农成分，不缺粮食，也供应了六百斤；白云林是副乡长白云祥的兄弟，不缺粮，也供应了三百斤。个别基层工作人员本身就起了大闹“缺粮”的“带头作用”，如贾家堡乡工作人员郭松林、贾培书本来不缺粮，却在群众中大喊“非供应不可”，于是，全乡就有百分之八十以上农户要求供应。
    从这些情况看来，把党员团员和基层工作人员的粮食供应整顿好，是扭转粮食供应中的不合理现象的先决条件。因此，各乡工作组都召开了党员团员和基层工作人员会议，首先整顿了对他们的粮食供应。在朝阳乡，组织党员团员工作人员学习了中央的指示，联系实际进行了检查，乡妇联主席、副乡长、生产委员主动地向群众检讨了自己不该供应而多买了粮食的错误，并当场自动交回供应粮六百斤。群众看到他们这样做，知道自己哄不过去了，就都把缺粮数报实了。这个乡原来要求增加供应两万斤，结果不但没增加，反而给国家交回一万五千斤粮食。
    依靠贫农，团结中农
    太谷县过去粮食统销工作中的根本缺点，就是没有很好地贯彻党在农村工作中的阶级路线。贫农最拥护统购统销政策的，可是，在统销工作中，他们的优势没有树立起来。中农对党的统购统销政策有顾虑，加上找工作人员又找得紧，便越装做“缺粮”。北敦村找工作人员要求供应的三十多人当中，除二人是贫农外，其余都是中农。他们极力主张“供应面要放宽些，哪怕量少些”，目的是挂个“缺粮户”的“牌子”，让政府觉得无粮可购。在这种情况下，富农和反革命分子就乘机造谣，甚至殴打工作人员，明目张胆地进行破坏。基层工作人员不用阶级观点分析问题，没有找到依靠力量，“光杆跳舞”，划不清余缺界线，被表面现象所迷惑，认为“凡是来找的、闹的就都是缺粮户”，因而不爱惜国家粮食，随便供应。朱家堡乡前一段供应面已达百分之六十七，工作人员还认为没解决问题。北洸乡供销社主任白全荣，看谁找得紧了，就私自从库内取出粮食，供应给他。农民智桂丹本来不缺粮，也发给他供应证；当他把证退回时，工作人员反问他说：“真的不缺吗？”
    要纠正不合理的供应，保证真正缺粮户的供应，使农村粮食统销做到合理，就必须贯彻党在农村工作中的阶级路线，充分发动群众。在这次整顿统销工作中，太谷各乡工作组依靠贫农摸清了余缺情况，对贫农中农讲清政策，发动贫农中农共同讨论了合理解决粮食问题的办法，打击了富农和反革命分子的破坏活动。经过群众讨论和对不合理的供应进行整顿，群众情绪安定了，供应面缩小了，供应合理了，粮食节约了。如朱家堡乡的供应面由原来的百分之六十七，降低到百分之三十二；北郭乡由原来的百分之四十三，降低到百分之二十点八。这些事实充分说明了：国家供应农村的粮食是够用的；许多农民说“缺粮”，是因为工作没做好，供应不合理，群众有顾虑；只要依靠群众摸清情况，向群众宣布指标、做好政治教育工作，并且依靠群众民主评议，就能在不突破原定供应计划的条件下把粮食统销工作做好。
