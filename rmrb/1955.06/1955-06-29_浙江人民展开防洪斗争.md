    The people of the Jinhua, Jiande, and Wenzhou regions of Zhejiang Province have recently experienced continuous torrential rains. The water levels of major rivers such as the Fuchun River, Xin'an River, Puyang River, and Ou River have risen sharply. In the Jinhua region, the water levels at all seven flood reporting stations in Jinhua, Lanxi, and other areas have exceeded the warning levels. Towns and villages along the rivers in Longyou, Lanxi, Jiande, Tonglu, and other places have been hit by floods. Local Party organizations and People's Governments are leading the masses in fighting the floods. On the evening of the 19th, Lanxi County organized more than 1,000 cadres, workers, and urban residents to brave the rain and carry out emergency repairs, adding more than 10,000 sacks to the dikes, saving 50,000 mu of rice fields from flooding. Jinua and Yiwu counties have both mobilized the masses to carry out rescue work.
    The Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee convened an emergency flood control meeting on June 21 to study the serious situation of the current floods in some areas and to determine emergency measures for flood fighting and prevention. The meeting required leading cadres at all levels to quickly mobilize and organize the masses, and to fully utilize all available boats, rafts, and other equipment to devote themselves to the flood fighting struggle. After the meeting, a group of cadres was drawn from provincial-level organizations to form a flood control work team. The first group of work teams left that evening for the Jinhua region to guide flood control work. (Our correspondent in Hangzhou)

    浙江人民展开防洪斗争
    浙江省金华、建德、温州地区近来连降暴雨，富春江、新安江、浦阳江、瓯江等主要河流，水势暴涨，金华地区的金华、兰溪等七个报汛站的水位全部超过警戒水位。龙游、兰溪、建德、桐庐等沿江城乡已遭到洪水侵袭。当地党组织和人民政府正领导群众与洪水斗争。十九日晚，兰溪县组织了一千多名机关工作人员、工人、城市居民冒雨抢险，在堤上加了一万多条麻袋，使五万亩稻田免受水灾；金华和义乌两县都发动群众进行了抢救。
    浙江省人民委员会于六月二十一日召开了防汛紧急会议，研究了当前部分地区发生洪水的严重情况，并确定抗洪、防洪的紧急措施。会议要求各级领导工作人员迅速发动群众、组织群众，运用当时当地一切可能运用的船只、木排等器材全力投入抗洪斗争。会后由省级机关抽调一批工作人员组成抗洪工作队，第一批工作队已于当晚赶往金华地区指导防洪工作。（本报驻杭州记者）
