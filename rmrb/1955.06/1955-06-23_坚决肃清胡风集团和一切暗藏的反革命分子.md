    Resolutely Purge the Hu Feng Clique and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    Thoroughly Crush the Hu Feng Clique
    Liu Wenhui
    Hu Feng and his clique have been secretly engaging in counter-revolutionary activities within the revolutionary ranks for a long time. This was the case before liberation, and it became even more rampant after liberation. This shows that Hu Feng and his clique are consistent, stubborn, planned, organized, strategic, and thoroughly anti-Communist and anti-people reactionary organizations. From the third batch of materials, we can see their ugly true colors more clearly and recognize the essence of the Hu Feng clique. Many of the key members of Hu Feng and his clique were originally loyal lackeys of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and they had close ties with the imperialist Kuomintang secret service agencies. They were hostile to the Chinese Communist Party, hostile to the Chinese people, hated the new China, and hated the people's democratic regime. All their activities revolved around one center: to attempt to overthrow the People's Republic of China led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Opposing the leadership of the Party on the literary and art front is only a component of the entire counter-revolutionary conspiracy activities of Hu Feng and his clique. The publication of the third batch of materials clearly proves that the problem of Hu Feng and his clique is not a matter of ideology but a serious political problem, not a matter of the people but a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution.
    Hu Feng and his clique knew that the fortress is easy to break from within. Therefore, they used Sun Wukong's tactics, hid in the revolutionary ranks for a long time, pretended to be revolutionaries, and actually engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. They vainly attempted to usurp the leadership of the Party, to destroy the people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Party, thereby undermining the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country. This is how they showed their loyalty to their masters—imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people are united around the Chinese Communist Party, have been tempered in the long-term revolutionary struggle, and cannot be deceived by Hu Feng and his clique who are wearing revolutionary cloaks; and the Chinese people have enough power to give any enemy a fatal blow. The current nationwide mass struggle against Hu Feng and his clique just illustrates this point. This is another great victory in our struggle against domestic and foreign enemies.
    The socialist revolution is a more extensive and profound revolution than the new democratic revolution. Therefore, the class struggle will inevitably be sharper and more complex. The resolute counter-revolutionary elements in the classes that have been eliminated and will be eliminated will never be willing to automatically withdraw from the stage of history. On the contrary, the closer the enemy gets to death, the more madly they will struggle. We must thoroughly crush the Hu Feng clique and demand that those who are unrepentant in Hu Feng and his clique be severely punished according to the law. At the same time, we must also be vigilant, expose all counter-revolutionary elements who have sneaked into the revolutionary ranks, and deal with them seriously.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party." "The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." We must strengthen our study under the leadership of the Party, study dialectical materialism more deeply and systematically, transform our thinking, draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, improve our political sensitivity, and in the sharp and complex struggles of the transition period, defeat all domestic and foreign enemies to ensure the smooth progress of the people's revolutionary achievements and socialist construction.
    The Sinister Activities of Hu Feng Elements in "Wen Hui Bao" and "Literary World" Weekly
    "Wen Hui Bao" Editorial Department
    Recently, we examined the reactionary articles published by Hu Feng clique members in Wen Hui Bao's literary and art weekly over the years. We found that at every critical juncture of revolutionary struggle, Hu Feng elements would write articles to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, slandering the Party and the revolutionary literary and art front led by the Party. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, shortly after the resumption of publication of this newspaper, Hu Feng elements Geng Yong and Yuemu, at the critical juncture of the anti-Chiang struggle in Shanghai, wormed their way into the then "New Literature" weekly of this newspaper to publish articles slandering progressive writers and engaging in ulterior divisive activities. Hu Feng element Geng Yong, in his articles "Briefly on Unease" and Yuemu's "Thoughts on the Bad Atmosphere in Literary Circles" (published in the March 17, 1947 "New Literature" weekly of this newspaper), provoked disunity in literary circles and attacked progressive writers Ba Jin and Tang Tao. They viciously called them "editors and debaters," with "servility and the style of setting up a ring," almost like "soldiers who have crossed the river," etc. At that time, the situation in Shanghai was: the white terror was serious, and the tragic case of the Quangong Building had only recently occurred. At this time, Hu Feng elements wrote articles in the newspaper to slander progressive writers, create chaos, and engage in ulterior provocation, causing a great uproar in literary circles. Comrade Guo Moruo wrote an article in the "New Literature" weekly, "Remembering the Story of Chopping Down the Cherry Tree," criticizing the articles of Hu Feng elements Geng Yong and Yuemu for randomly attacking progressive writers. Unexpectedly, this well-intentioned criticism was met with even more frantic attacks by Hu Feng elements, and Guo Moruo was insulted with extremely vicious and vile words. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique slandered progressive writers in the environment of white terror in Shanghai at that time, created chaos, colluded with Kuomintang secret agents, and engaged in despicable provocative activities, which shows that they were completely a group of chameleons, a group of people with ulterior motives and origins.
    During the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique on the one hand asked Zhang Yu to continuously submit articles to "Literary Gazette," repeatedly asking the leading comrades of the Party's literary and art work in Shanghai to make self-criticisms, in order to achieve their goal of attacking the leading comrades of literary and art work; on the other hand, other Hu Feng elements, through Mei Lin, published articles in "Literary World" opposing learning. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique conspired to use this "gap," using the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" as a pretext, to carry out personal attacks, expand the scope of attack, shift the target of ideological struggle, and attempt to point the spearhead at the Party, at the Party's literary and art leadership, and at the Party's literary and art policy, in order to achieve their goal of undermining the people's revolutionary cause. Hu Feng clique members Geng Yong, Zhang Yu, Luo Shi, Luo Luo, etc., successively wrote articles in "Literary World" opposing the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," flatly denying the necessity of criticizing Wu Xun, The Life of Wu Xun, and the spirit of Wu Xun, saying that Wu Xun was a person who had "long been buried in the dust of history," that Mr. Lu Xun had criticized him more than ten years ago, and that the mistakes of "The Life of Wu Xun" were entirely the responsibility of Sun Yu and the Party's literary and art leading comrades. Therefore, Hu Feng elements proposed to "carry out thorough criticism" only of the author, saying that "between Wu Xun and Mr. Sun Yu, there exist things that are essentially the same and interconnected," attempting to turn the struggle into personal attacks and confuse the front of ideological struggle. At the same time, they clamored that anyone who advocated criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun" and drew lessons from this ideological movement was a kind of "unlucky thinking" and "contempt for the people's ability to discern" (all of the above can be found in the 71st issue of "Literary World" on June 4, 1951). Hu Feng clique members used the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" to concentrate their efforts and launch a frantic attack on the Party's literary and art leading comrades in an extremely vicious manner. At that time, the editorial board of "Literary World" was very dissatisfied with the rampant behavior of Hu Feng elements, but Mei Lin did not accept criticism and even planned to continue publishing Luo Shi's counter-criticism article, but it was not published because "Literary World" was suspended. From the above materials, it can be seen that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique completely and purposefully turned the spearhead of struggle towards the Party and the Party's literary and art leading comrades, conspiring to undermine the ideological criticism movement called for by the Party. Due to the Hu Feng clique's frantic sabotage, it did indeed affect the in-depth development of the criticism movement against "The Life of Wu Xun" in Shanghai at that time.
    Hu Feng clique members not only openly attacked the Party, slandered the Party's literary and art leading comrades and progressive writers, but also extremely secretly carried out "piecemeal" attacks on the revolution in many articles, slandering the revolution and slandering the working people. Some articles, under the guise of introducing the experience of literary and art creation in factories, exaggerated the backwardness of the workers, advocated going to the "latrines" of factories to experience the lives of the workers, and even equated the working class with alien elements who had infiltrated the ranks of the working class, spreading reactionary fallacies such as "the workers are backward and should be criticized... and cannot be blurred by the general concept of the working class." Counter-revolutionary ringleader Hu Feng himself, in his "Postscript to 'Literary Talks'" in the 63rd issue of "Literary World" (published on April 9, 1951), even more brazenly attacked the so-called "vulgar atmosphere" draped over the revolutionary realism, slandering revolutionary literature and art as "mechanical materialism." Hu Feng element Zhang Yu, in his article "On 'Rushing Tasks'" in the same issue, attacked the "Literary Gazette"'s discussion on the issue of "rushing tasks," and used the shortcomings in some works written by writers for political movements to viciously slander many writers who actively participated in political struggles at that time, saying that this was "a kind of irresponsible, degenerate, and intolerable behavior for people's literature." At that time, the editorial department of this newspaper had replaced manuscripts in the "Literary World" weekly that had significant errors, and Mei Lin protested to Ke Ling, the then editor-in-chief of this newspaper, using resignation as a threat; and wrote a letter to Comrade Feng Xuefeng, scolding Tang Tao, the then chief writer of this newspaper, as a "petty bourgeois." From the above materials, it can be seen how much the Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary clique hated the working class, how much they hated the Chinese Communist Party, and how much they hated the revolutionary literary and art cause led by the Party.
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique used the "Literary World" weekly as one of their strongholds for carrying out anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities, selling a large number of counter-revolutionary goods. There were as many as thirteen articles opposing the discussion of the "Life of Wu Xun" issue alone. These facts truly make us shudder! In this incident, it was deeply exposed that we had lost our vigilance against counter-revolutionary elements, that we did not sufficiently recognize the enemy's use of double-dealing tactics to deceive us, and that we were insensitive to the counter-revolutionary elements' various tactics of "avoiding being too sharp," "not necessarily saying empty words," and "letting a little bit out through him (i.e., Hu Feng element Mei Lin)." Therefore, we were actually used by counter-revolutionary elements for two years. We must learn a lesson from the Hu Feng incident, increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, improve our ability to distinguish counter-revolutionary elements, eliminate all loopholes, and never be fooled by counter-revolutionary elements; and, we must give play to the role of the people's newspapers, constantly educate readers, raise vigilance, strengthen the battle, and struggle to thoroughly crush the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and its ideological influence! Struggle to thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements!

    坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
    彻底粉碎胡风集团
    刘文辉
    胡风和胡风集团长期以来一直暗藏在革命阵营内进行反革命活动，解放前是这样，解放后更加猖狂。这说明胡风和胡风集团是一贯的，顽强的，有计划、有组织、有战略的，彻头彻尾的反共反人民的反动组织。我们从第三批材料里，更清楚地看出他们丑恶的本来面目，认清了胡风集团的本质。胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子原来是蒋匪帮的忠实走狗，他们同帝国主义国民党特务机关都有密切联系。他们敌视中国共产党，敌视中国人民，仇恨新中国，仇恨人民民主政权。他们的一切活动都围绕着一个中心，就是企图推翻工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的中华人民共和国。在文艺战线上反对党的领导，这只是胡风和胡风集团整个反革命阴谋活动的一个组成部分。第三批材料的发表，更明显地证明胡风和胡风集团的问题，不是思想问题而是严重的政治问题，不是人民内部的问题而是革命同反革命斗争的问题。
    胡风和胡风集团知道堡垒是容易从内部攻破的，因此，他们施展孙悟空的战术，长期隐身在革命队伍里面，伪装革命，实际干着反革命勾当。妄想篡夺党的领导权，妄想破坏党领导下的人民民主统一战线，从而破坏我们国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业。这样来效忠于他们的主子——帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮。这是全中国人民绝对不能容忍的。中国人民团结在中国共产党周围，在革命斗争中受过长期的锻炼，不是披着革命外衣的胡风和胡风集团所能欺骗的；而且中国人民具有足够的力量，给予任何敌人以致命的打击。现在全国展开反胡风和胡风集团的群众性斗争，正好说明这点。这是我们反对国内外敌人的斗争中的又一个伟大胜利。
    社会主义革命是比新民主主义革命更广泛、更深刻的革命，因此，阶级斗争必然会更尖锐、更复杂。已被消灭和将被消灭的阶级中的坚决反革命分子，绝不会甘心自动退出历史舞台，相反地，敌人越接近死亡，越会带有垂死挣扎的疯狂性质。我们要彻底粉碎胡风集团，对胡风和胡风集团中死不改悔的分子，要求依法给予严厉惩处。同时，还要提高警惕，把混入革命阵营的一切反革命分子揭发出来，认真处理。
    毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”我们要在党的领导下，加强学习，更深入地有系统地学习辩证唯物主义，改造思想，划清敌我界限，提高政治嗅觉，在过渡时期尖锐复杂的斗争中，战胜一切国内外敌人，以保障人民革命的成果和社会主义建设事业顺利地进行。
    胡风分子在“文汇报”“文学界”周刊的罪恶活动
    “文汇报”编辑部
    最近我们检查了胡风集团分子历年在文汇报文艺周刊上所发表的反动文章。我们发现在每个革命斗争的紧要关头，胡风分子必写文章，同蒋介石匪帮里应外合，污蔑党和党所领导的革命文艺战线。抗日战争胜利以后，本报复刊不久，胡风分子耿庸和曰木在上海反蒋斗争的紧要关头，钻到当时本报的“新文艺”周刊上发表文章，污蔑进步作家，进行别有用心的挑拨活动。胡风分子耿庸在“略说不安”和曰木的“从文艺界恶劣风气想起”两篇文章中（载于一九四七年三月十七日本报“新文艺”周刊），挑拨文艺界的团结，攻击进步作家巴金和唐弢同志。恶毒地称他们为“编辑家和论客”，“奴性和摆擂台作风”，同“过河卒子”差不多等等。当时上海的情况是：白色恐怖严重，劝工大楼惨案发生还不久。胡风分子这时候就在报上写文章污蔑进步作家，制造混乱，进行别有用心的挑拨，在文艺界引起了很大的风波。郭沫若同志为此在
  “新文艺”周刊写了一篇文章“想起了斫樱桃树的故事”，批评了胡风分子耿庸和曰木对进步作家乱加攻击的文章。不料这种善意的批评竟遭到胡风分子更疯狂的攻击，并且用极恶毒极下流的词句辱骂郭沫若同志。胡风反革命集团在当时上海白色恐怖的环境下，污蔑进步作家，制造混乱，同国民党特务里应外合，进行卑鄙的挑拨活动，这说明他们完全是一伙变色的蜥蜴，是一伙别有用心别有来历的人。
    在批判电影“武训传”期间，胡风反革命集团一方面叫张禹接连向“文艺报”投稿，一再要求上海党的文艺工作领导同志作检讨，以便达到他们打击文艺工作的领导同志的目的；另一方面其他胡风分子通过梅林，在“文学界”发表文章反对学习。胡风反革命集团阴谋利用这个“缺口”，借批判“武训传”为名，进行人身攻击，扩大打击面，转移思想斗争的目标，企图把矛头指向党、指向党的文艺领导和党的文艺政策，达到他们破坏人民革命事业的目的。胡风集团分子耿庸、张禹、罗石、罗洛等纷纷在“文学界”写文章反对批判“武训传”，一口否认有批判武训、武训传和武训精神的必要，说武训这个人是“早就在历史的尘埃中埋葬了的”，鲁迅先生十多年前已经批判过，“武训传”的错误完全是孙瑜和党的文艺领导同志的责任。因此胡风分子提出只对作者“展开彻底的批评”，说“武训和孙瑜先生之间，存在着本质上相同又相通的东西”，企图把斗争转为人身攻击，混乱思想斗争的阵线。同时又叫嚣谁要是提倡批判“武训传”，并从这一思想运动中吸取教训，那就是一种“倒楣思想”和“对于人民鉴别能力的轻蔑”（以上均见一九五一年六月四日第七十一期“文学界”）。胡风集团分子利用“武训传”的批判，极其狠毒地集中力量对党的文艺领导同志展开了疯狂的攻击。当时“文学界”的编委们对胡风分子的猖狂很不满意，但是梅林并不接受批评，还打算将罗石的反批评文章继续发表，后来因为“文学界”停刊，终未刊出。从以上的材料可以看出，胡风反革命集团完全是有计划有目的地把斗争的锋芒转向党和党的文艺领导同志，阴谋破坏党所号召的思想批判运动。由于胡风集团的疯狂破坏，确实曾经影响了当时上海对“武训传”批判运动的深入开展。
    胡风集团分子不但公开地向党进攻，污蔑党的文艺领导同志和进步作家，并且极其隐秘地在许多文章中对革命进行“点滴”的进攻，污蔑革命，污蔑劳动人民。有的文章在介绍工厂文艺创作经验的幌子下，夸大工人的落后，提倡到工厂的“茅坑里”去体验工人生活，甚至将工人阶级同混入工人阶级队伍的异己分子混为一谈，散布所谓“工人落后，应该予以批判……而不能为工人阶级笼统的观念模糊”等反动谬论。反革命头子胡风本人在第六十三期“文学界”（刊于一九五一年四月九日）的“‘文艺笔谈’后记”一文中，更大肆攻击所谓罩在革命的现实主义头上的“庸俗的气氛”，污蔑革命文艺是“机械唯物论”。胡风分子张禹在同期“论‘赶任务’”一文中，攻击“文艺报”关于“赶任务”问题的讨论，并利用作家为政治运动所写的一些作品中的缺点，恶毒地谩骂当时许多积极参加政治斗争的作家，说这是“一种毫无责任感的、堕落的、为人民文学所不能容忍的行为”。当时本报编辑部曾撤换过“文学界”周刊有显著错误的稿件，梅林为此竟向当时本报总编辑柯灵抗议，以辞职要挟；并写信给冯雪峰同志，大骂当时本报主笔唐弢为“市侩”。从以上的材料可以看出，胡风及其反革命集团，是多么仇视工人阶级，多么仇视中国共产党，多么仇视党所领导的革命文艺事业。
    胡风反革命集团利用“文学界”周刊，作为他们进行反党、反人民、反革命活动的据点之一，大批贩卖反革命的私货。仅仅反对讨论“武训传”问题的文章即有十三篇之多。这些事实，真使我们不寒而栗！在这一事件中，深刻暴露了我们对反革命分子是丧失警惕的，对于敌人用两面派的手法欺骗我们是认识不足的，对于反革命分子用“避免太尖锐”、“也不必说空话”、“通过他（即胡风分子梅林）漏一点东西出去”的种种战术是不敏感的。因此，我们竟被反革命分子利用了两年。我们一定要从胡风事件中吸取教训，百倍地提高革命警惕性，提高自己对反革命分子的辨别能力，杜绝一切漏洞，决不上反革命分子的当；并且，要发挥人民报纸的作用，不断教育读者，提高警惕，加强战斗，为彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团及其思想影响而斗争！为彻底清除一切反革命分子而斗争！
