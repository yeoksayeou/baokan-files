The publication of the first and second batches of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has aroused great indignation among the broad masses of the people nationwide against the counter-revolutionaries. People demand to know the political background of the Hu Feng clique. They ask: Who is the mastermind behind Hu Feng? Regarding this question, the People's Government has obtained a large amount of materials. Part of these materials is published in this "Third Batch." Hu Feng and many key members of the Hu Feng clique have long been loyal lackeys of the Kuomintang. They have had close ties with the Imperialist Kuomintang secret service agencies. For a long time, they have disguised themselves as revolutionaries, hiding within progressive circles, and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities.

In the following materials, one can see the true faces of those whom Hu Feng praises as "revolutionary writers who have pursued revolution for more than a decade," such as A Lang, and Hu Feng himself, who claims to have followed the revolution for twenty years. In a letter to Hu Feng, A Lang expressed great optimism about the nationwide counter-revolutionary civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek in July 1946, believing that the "main force" of the People's Liberation Army could be defeated in three months and "eliminated" in a year. He also boasted about Chiang Kai-shek's "speeches," saying that his "confidence" made everyone more inspired. A Lang regarded the revolutionary forces of the people as "pus," believing that it must be "drained out," and that the attack on the revolutionary forces of the people must be decisive and thorough, "not doing it halfway."

Why were they so decisive? It turns out that Hu Feng, A Lang, and others are people with hidden backgrounds.

A Lang, also known as Chen Yimen and Chen Shumei, is from Zhejiang. He was originally a Kuomintang officer. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he stayed in Yan'an for a few months at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University but did not go to the front lines. Instead, he went to Hu Zongnan's "War College Fourth Regiment" to serve as a junior military instructor. The letter published here was written by him in July 1946 from the Army University in Chongqing's Shandong Cave. He had already transferred from Hu Zongnan to this place for training and was later appointed as a tactics instructor after graduation. "Shandong Cave" is the location of Chiang Kai-shek's Army University and also Chiang Kai-shek's residence in Chongqing during his time there.

Hu Feng, also known as Zhang Guangren and Gu Fei, is from Hubei. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, he joined the Communist Youth League. In 1925, in Beijing, the white terror under the rule of Warlord Wu Peifu frightened him out of his wits, and he insisted on the party allowing him to withdraw from the league. Later, he worked as an anti-communist political officer in the "Anti-Communist" army in Jiangxi and went to Japan for a while, engaging in some unspeakable activities. After returning to the country, he infiltrated left-wing cultural organizations in Shanghai, conducting various split and sabotage activities from within. During the Wuhan and Chongqing periods, he had connections with many Kuomintang secret service chiefs. From the letter published here from Hu Feng to A Lang, one can also see Hu Feng's relationship with Chen Zhen, one of the Kuomintang secret service chiefs. Hu Feng's brief history was only recently discovered. Because he concealed it so cleverly, everyone was deceived by him.

Before the liberation of the entire country, the Hu Feng clique fervently hoped for the victory of Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war and the failure of the people's revolutionary forces. After Chiang Kai-shek's defeat and the liberation of the entire country, they continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities with even more treacherous two-faced tactics while hiding on the mainland.

They expressed deep hatred for the new society and the people's revolutionary government after liberation, saying, "I hate this social order," and cursing the "demise" and "collapse" of the people's revolutionary government!

After this newspaper published the first and second batches of exposés, some people still said: The Hu Feng clique is just a small group of ambitious individuals in the cultural circle, and they may not have any reactionary political background. Those who say such things either sympathize with them from a class instinct or are politically insensitive, thinking too naively; some are hidden reactionaries, or even members of the Hu Feng clique, such as Lü Yi in Beijing.

Now is the time to thoroughly expose the true face of this batch of counter-revolutionary black gangsters! The Chinese people will no longer allow them to continue playing tricks! The people of the entire country must be vigilant! All hidden counter-revolutionaries must be exposed! Their counter-revolutionary crimes must be punished!

1. Hu Feng and members of the Hu Feng clique have long had close ties with the Kuomintang secret service agencies. Hu Feng, A Lang, and others are loyal lackeys of the Kuomintang. They wholeheartedly supported or actively participated in Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war. They dreamed of "eliminating" the People's Liberation Army and showed strong hatred and fear towards the victory of the Chinese people's revolution.

1. September 26, 1947, Hu Feng's letter to A Lang (from Shanghai)

   It is Chen Zhuo. He served as the police chief of Beijing last year. Please find him immediately and ask for his help. I guarantee that he has no such connection. This point can be reported to Chen. I suspect it was done by a small woman who lived in his house (they recently had a falling out), either because of the student incident mentioned in the previous letter or because he is a writer, and that's all. Please let Chen proceed immediately (the word in the middle), let them return, and if there are any difficulties, at least let the wife return. It is ridiculous to keep a housewife.

   [Chen Zhuo] is Chen Zhen, one of the Kuomintang secret service chiefs. Hu Feng member Jia Zhi Fang was arrested by the Kuomintang in 1947 due to a misunderstanding. The reason for the arrest, as mentioned in another letter from Hu Feng to A Lang, was that Jia Zhi Fang "lived in a place where several students had lived before, and he used their mailbox." Hu Feng wrote to A Lang, asking A Lang to find Chen Zhen and report to Chen that Hu Feng "guaranteed" Jia Zhi Fang had no connection with the revolution. From these letters, one can see the close relationship between Hu Feng and his clique members with the Kuomintang secret service agents. [Zhi Ge] refers to Jia Zhi Fang. [Middle word] refers to the Kuomintang "Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau." The word "Chen" in the letter all refers to Chen Zhen. "Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau" is the abbreviation for the "Kuomintang Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau."

2. September 28, 1947, Hu Feng's letter to A Lang (from Shanghai)

   Zhi Ge's wife returned yesterday, and there was a phone call. It was just about the matter of their house being rented to students. Chen's telegram proved it, and they can return. Of course, she will directly ask someone to seek Chen, and if your side has a good relationship, you can also urge him. I think the sooner the better, to avoid more dreams.

   [Chen] refers to Chen Zhen. (The notes in the letter are original, and the same below.)

3. October 1, 1947, Hu Feng's letter to A Lang (from Shanghai)

   The letter has been received. Yesterday, I visited Ren Min. The situation is of course not serious (it is just the student incident), (they treated him very politely), I don't know if he can return immediately. That is the matter of the "Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau," and she is looking for someone on the same side here.

   [Ren Min] is Jia Zhi Fang's wife. [Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau] refers to the Kuomintang "Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau," which is the abbreviation for the "Kuomintang Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau." [Same side people] refers to people on the same side of the "Central Investigation and Statistics Bureau."

4. July 15, 1946, A Lang's letter to Hu Feng (from Chongqing Army University in Shandong Cave)

   As for the overall situation, everything here is full of optimism. So, I also tell you to be optimistic. The main force can be defeated in three months, and it will be eliminated in a year. A meeting of battalion commanders and above was convened, and he gave a speech. His confidence also inspired everyone. At the same time, the mechanical troops here were airlifted to Jinan, and the anti-tank troops were airlifted to Guihua. There is no turning back, it is pus, and it must be drained out!

   [He] refers to Chiang Kai-shek.

   Note: From this kind of letter, one can see that the Hu Feng clique is not a simple "literary" clique but a counter-revolutionary political clique disguised as "literary." They hate all revolutionary forces of the people. Hu Feng member Zhang Zhongxiao said, "I almost hate everyone." Many people think that "Hu Feng is just a cultural figure, and the Hu Feng incident is just a cultural event, unrelated to other circles," but after seeing this kind of material, they should have woken up!

5. May 13, 1944, Lü Yuan's letter to Hu Feng (from Chongqing)

   I have been transferred to work at the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, located at Cizhou Port, and will start on the 15th; I will not go to the Aviation Commission.

   ... There are many Americans here, and life may change a bit.

   I seem to have really started living, and it is indeed difficult to get along with people, just as you said: going into battle bare-chested is not our tactic. In the future, I think I should learn a bit of "dark wisdom" (?), and I am only afraid of myself.

6. September 23, 1947, Lü Yuan's letter to A Lang and Liu Dexin (from Wuhan)

   Bai Han's letter said that the evil bandits are stirring up his hometown, and he may have to flee again.

   [Liu Dexin] is Hua Tie, a member of the Hu Feng clique. [Bai Han] is Fang Ran. [His hometown] refers to Anqing.

   Note: From these two letters, one can see the true face of Hu Feng's key member Lü Yuan, and the Hu Feng clique is composed of such people. In May 1944, Lü Yuan was "transferred to" the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" to "work." The "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" is the abbreviation for the "Sino-American Special Technical Cooperation Organization," which is a dark and sinister secret service agency jointly run by American imperialism and the Kuomintang, known for its brutal torture and massacre of communists and progressive elements. Who could transfer Lü Yuan to this secret service agency? The secret service agency could "transfer" whom to "work"? This is self-evident. In the latter letter, in September 1947, Lü Yuan still cursed the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary forces of the people as "evil bandits," but in early 1948, he was introduced by another Hu Feng key member, Zhang Zuo, as a Communist Party member, infiltrating the underground party organization. Later, Lü Yuan suddenly fled. When Wuhan was liberated, he suddenly returned to Wuhan with Zhang Zuo, claiming to be "Communist Party members," and took over the "Da Gang Newspaper." In 1950, he infiltrated the party again (see item 28 in this material). This is how the members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique "followed the revolution" and infiltrated the Communist Party.

7. November 21, 194X, Zhuang Yong's letter to Hu Feng (from Chongqing)

   ... I heard that the magazine you are editing will be published by Zhengzhong Bookstore. It's okay, I guess!

   [Zhuang Yong] is a landlord counter-revolutionary. When the Liberation Army temporarily withdrew from his hometown, Jiangsu Province's Pizhou County, in 1946, he privately set up a court to torture peasants, carried out a counter-revolutionary restoration, and forced many peasants to death.

   [Zhengzhong Bookstore] is a bookstore run by Kuomintang CC members.

8. September 15, 1947, Lu Ling's letter to Hu Feng (from Nanjing)

   Tongcheng fell, I don't know how Guan Ge is doing? But he probably couldn't get out, this is really a bit embarrassing.

   [Tongcheng fell] refers to the People's Liberation Army temporarily liberated Tongcheng County, Anhui Province. Hu Feng members were terrified. On October 11 of the same year, Lu Ling wrote to Hu Feng, asking, "Has Tongcheng been recovered?" [Guan Ge] is Shu Wu, who was then a member of the Hu Feng clique.

9. September 10, 1947, Fang Ran's letter to Hu Feng (from Anqing)

   These two days, this small city is in great chaos, and the bandit army is about to approach. We are helpless in the chaos, leaving everything to fate.

   [Bandit army] see the note in the next letter.

10. September 26, 1947, Fang Ran's letter to Hu Feng (from Anqing)

    Recently, due to the frequent recovery by the national army, people's hearts have settled down. ... Guan Ge's place has become a tug-of-war, and I don't know his whereabouts. Have you heard from Mr. Hu? I miss him very much.

    [Bandit army] [National army] Hu Feng members in secret letters slander the People's Liberation Army as "bandit army," refer to the Kuomintang reactionary army as "national army," and call the temporarily occupied places by the Kuomintang reactionary army "recovered," and say "people's hearts have settled down." Here, their true faces are completely exposed.

11. January 31, 1949, Lu Ling's letter to Lü Yuan (from Nanjing)

    The issues of the Great River supplement have all been received. Generally, they are in a vague and confusing state, full of muddled arguments. But a new storm is brewing, and people's hearts are too busy to care about these things. We hope to welcome hardships and do better, more solid work.

    [Great River supplement] refers to the supplement of the "Da Gang Newspaper" in Hankou. [New storm] refers to the imminent liberation of Nanjing; at that time, the people of the whole country were excited and inspired, while the Hu Feng members were preparing to "welcome hardships." [Better, more solid work] refers to more concealed and disguised counter-revolutionary work.

2. The Hu Feng clique secretly discussed and formulated counter-revolutionary strategies and plans after the liberation of the entire country, launching a fierce attack on the Party and the people.

12. March 21, 1950, Lu Ding's letter to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

    After the second critical article came out, I was really stunned at the time: A Lang made a wrong and unjust accusation, but this is a serious mistake! Because of this, many people have doubts about your past theories, which is a very bad thing! Therefore, I suggest that he goes to see Zhou Yang and explains the cause of this mistake, explaining that it is his personal matter, and I think this is not a surrender in theory, but a matter of integrity. Because no matter what, you cannot be implicated, and other friends ...

    [The second critical article] refers to the article by Shi Dusong in the "People's Daily" on March 1950 criticizing A Lang's "On Positive and Negative Characters." In that article, A Lang distorted and forged Marx's works, recommending spy literature as an "example" and "direction" to readers. Shi Dusong pointed out A Lang's evil deeds, making A Lang and the Hu Feng clique members very embarrassed. [This is not a surrender in theory, but a matter of integrity] These two sentences are the ironclad evidence of the anti-Party activities of the Hu Feng clique member Lu Ding who infiltrated the Party. Here, he frankly says that in his view, admitting mistakes to the Party is "surrender," while being loyal to Hu Feng is "integrity." Because A Lang and Hu Feng appeared in the guise of "literary theorists," Lu Ding said in pain: "Many people have doubts about your past theories, which is a very bad thing!"

13. June 21, 1950, Lü Yi's letter to Hu Feng (from Qingdao)

    Regarding Shou Mei Ge's writings, I have seen them all, and I think Shou Mei Ge should write a "Distortion and Forgery is not Criticism" to respond. (Of course, the quotation is wrong)

    [Shou Mei Ge's writings] Shou Mei is A Lang, and "writings" refer to A Lang's letter to the "People's Daily." After the "People's Daily" published Chen Yong and Shi Dusong's criticism of his article in March 1950, A Lang wrote a letter admitting his mistake of distorting the translation of Marx's works. Hu Feng clique member Lü Yi suggested in this letter that "distortion and forgery" is not A Lang but the Party newspaper. Lü Yi incited A Lang to counterattack the Party newspaper and even suggested the title of the article. At the joint expanded meeting of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers' Association, which was attended by more than 700 people, to discuss the expulsion of Hu Feng's membership and the revocation of all his positions, it was Lü Yi who stood up to defend Hu Feng.

14. June 26, 195X, Zhang Zhongxiao's letter to Mei Zhi (Hu Feng's wife) (from Shaoxing)

    Ask you: Is this Xue Wei representing the official side? Or is he close to the official side? Or is he familiar with the official side?

    Mei Lin said he hopes I can communicate with Fang Dian and Geng Yong, but can you introduce them to me? For example, what are they doing? I remember that in "Hope" Volume 3, Issue 3, there is an article "How do you think the smell of the smoked fish is?" I don't know if it is this Geng Yong?

    [Official side] refers to the Party leadership. [Fang Dian] is Wang Yuanhua. In this letter, Zhang Zhongxiao inquired about the situation of several people, aiming to establish connections among their clique members. [Xue Wei, Mei Lin, Geng Yong] are all members of the Hu Feng clique.

15. July 31, 195X, A Lang's letter to Luo Luo (from Tianjin)

    You, if you can go to Xue Wei, that would be great. This person, although I have not had much contact with him, I have been close to him in Yan'an, and he is a strong and serious person. Going to him, work and other things will be more beneficial. It seems that Fei Ge, Yuanhua, have been transferred there, probably to do some things, and it is also a manifestation of determination and courage.

    [Fei Ge, Yuanhua] are Luo Fei and Wang Yuanhua. In this letter, A Lang highly praised Liu Xuewei, indicating that he and Liu Xuewei had a relationship as early as 1938 in Yan'an. A Lang thought that Luo Luo, Luo Fei, Wang Yuanhua, and others could be transferred to the Shanghai New Literature Publishing House, which was run by Liu Xuewei, and there would be a lot to do. In fact, it turned out to be the case. After the Hu Feng clique occupied this publishing house, they used it as a base to carry out many counter-revolutionary activities.

16. August 16, 1951, A Lang's letter to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

    Now we need to help Xue Wei to establish a foundation in Shanghai, work hard, and do good work among the masses. This is how we start; so, we cannot easily, seemingly having the opportunity to publish, write casually. Before the position is strong, we cannot start shooting. Especially, we cannot make Xue Wei suffer from not being able to work, and this result is not good.

    [Xue] refers to Liu Xuewei.

17. August 30, 195X, A Lang's letter to Luo Luo (from Tianjin)

    Therefore, we need to help Xue Wei. The main thing is: prepare conditions, more conditions, and even more conditions! This is how we can truly help Xue Wei, and this is beneficial to the embryo of the new era.

18. August 24, 1951, A Lang's letter to Mei Zhi (from Tianjin)

    I just think that it is best to work hard and build a good foundation among the masses. If you want to criticize, then find a big target, and the points must be organized and considered more strictly; small things and small matters are best not to deal with. I think there are many friends in Shanghai, and it is better to discuss and do it together. I think Xue Wei is there, and the foundation is good, with conditions. First, do this.

    [Friends] refers to the followers of the Hu Feng clique.

    Note: From A Lang's letters, one can see that the Hu Feng members understand some strategies of counter-revolutionary underground work. He said: "Do not shoot before the position is strong." But "the main thing is to prepare conditions, more conditions, and even more conditions!" Work hard and do good work among the masses, build a good foundation among the masses, and then "find a big target," that is, aim at the vital points of the revolution to attack. When attacking, discuss more with "friends," organize and consider the points more strictly, and small things and small matters are best not to deal with. Counter-revolutionaries are not so clumsy, and their strategies are very cunning and vicious. All revolutionary comrades must not underestimate them and must greatly enhance the people's political vigilance to deal with and eliminate them.

19. February 3, 1952, Lü Yuan's letter to Hu Feng (from Wuhan)

    Struggle requires energy and strategy. In addition to principles, all details should be considered within the scope of strategy. Our environment requires us to be more serious and calm.

    You know, due to long-term "worship," many young and capable forces gradually became numb from panic, which is what you said, "moldy." But doesn't this phenomenon increase our sense of responsibility? At the same time, doesn't it also heighten our vigilance in struggle?

    [Worship] This is the Hu Feng members' slanderous remark about the broad masses of the people supporting the Party and the Party leadership.

20. March 11, 1952, Lu Ling's letter to Hu Feng (from Beijing)

    Bai Shan taking over that mess is really difficult. Ding Ge said: It's best not to take on these things now! But I think he can also fight with the phenomena inside and expose more locusts. Active construction is now impossible, so I hope he won't be dragged down by that black mass and unable to move.

    [Bai Shan] is Peng Baishan, a Hu Feng member in Shanghai. [Taking over that mess] refers to Peng Baishan obtaining the position of Deputy Minister of Culture of the former East China Military and Political Committee. Beijing Hu Feng members regarded this as a big event for the Hu Feng reactionary clique and paid great attention to it. [Ding Ge] refers to Lu Ding, a Hu Feng member in Tianjin. [Those phenomena] [Locusts] [That black mass] These are all Hu Feng members' curses against revolutionary cultural work and cultural workers. [Active construction] refers to the counter-revolutionary business of the Hu Feng clique.

21. May 3, 195X, A Lang's letter to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

    Lu Ge talked today about how to sweep away the petty bourgeoisie. He also wants to write a poem, implying criticism of He Laoye, so he will be active.

    I went to the Normal College again today. According to the feedback, interest in literature has been aroused. Today, except for the people in the literature and history department, chairs were placed at the door, and four or five people sat there. Ding Ge also gave two lectures at Nankai Middle School, with very good results. ... Plan to continue and expand.

    [Lu Ge] refers to Hu Feng member Lu Li. [Petty bourgeoisie] is a slanderous remark about Party and non-Party cultural workers. [He Laoye] refers to Comrade He Qifang. [Normal College] refers to Tianjin Normal College. A Lang and Lu Ding were active in Tianjin, giving lectures everywhere to spread and expand their influence.

22. May 7, 1952, Lu Ding's letter to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

    I discussed with Ning, Xu, and Yan, hoping you can write to Zhou soon, expressing your desire to come to Beijing and work; if he doesn't reply, write again to urge him; if he still doesn't reply, come to Beijing to find him. ... Next, we should adopt an offensive strategy, that is, not wait for them to raise your issue, but you first raise your views on the current literary movement to them, giving them a surprise.

    [Ning, Xu, and Yan] refer to Hu Feng members Lu Ling, Xu Fang, and Yan Wang. At that time, Hu Feng was still in Shanghai, and some Hu Feng members in Beijing discussed letting Hu Feng come to Beijing to command his followers to attack the Party and planned the strategy and tactics for attacking the Party. [Zhou] refers to Comrade Zhou Enlai. [Not wait for them to raise your issue ...] "They" refer to comrades leading literary work in the Party. [Above] refers to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    Note: Lu Ding's strategy of attacking to defend later became a reality for Hu Feng, which is Hu Feng coming to Beijing to ask for a job, asking to discuss his issue, a 300,000-word petition, and finally seizing the "Literary Gazette" issue to launch a big attack. Representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current survival and benefit future development, they often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend. Either fabricate rumors in front of them; or seize a few surface phenomena to attack the essence of things; or praise a part of people, attack a part of people; or take advantage of the opportunity, "open a gap," making us in a difficult position. In short, they are always studying strategies to deal with us, "observing the direction," seeking to succeed. Sometimes they will "pretend to be dead and lie down," waiting for the opportunity to "counterattack." They have long experience in class struggle, and they will fight in various forms—legal and illegal struggles. We revolutionary comrades must understand their tricks, study their strategies, and defeat them. We must not be too naive, treating complex class struggles too simply.

23. May 18, 1952, Lü Yuan's letter to Hu Feng (from Wuhan)

    Mei Ge passed through Wuhan not long ago and went back to Tianjin. His beard and hair are already gray, and his mood is not bright. Going back, he happened to encounter the rectification campaign. With his sincerity, I think nothing unexpected will happen. But, dealing with these gentlemen, one must go deep into their hearts, otherwise, one may encounter some unexpected blows. I am therefore worried that he will handle these trivial relationships with his loyalty to us, resulting in some trouble. This is naturally my overthinking, but the struggle indeed does not allow any negligence.

    [Mei Ge] refers to A Lang. [Rectification] refers to the literary rectification. [Ning Ge] refers to Lu Ling. In this letter, Lü Yuan thought that A Lang should have a strategy to deal with the literary rectification and play a two-faced role to "go deep into their hearts."

    Note: Due to the arrogance and complacency of revolutionary comrades, negligence, or focusing on work and forgetting politics, many counter-revolutionaries have "gone deep into our hearts." This is not just the Hu Feng members, but more other spy or bad elements have also infiltrated. This should be a lesson for all Party organizations. These counter-revolutionaries are deceiving us after using all their tricks to infiltrate the Party. They regard this as a "struggle" and they have won! They have come in!

24. May 5, 1954, Fang Ran's letter to Hu Feng (from Hangzhou)

    Make an effort and finish it soon. But I think the attitude at this time is also important. In short, it must be an active and close attitude: ? Submit the theory and the application for party membership at the same time; ? Actively participate in all literary and social activities, for example, accept invitations to attend various symposiums, do not decline, do not remain silent; ? Do not complain to anyone, etc. The reason is self-evident.

    [Submit the theory] The "theory" refers to Hu Feng's 300,000-word "opinion book" to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, launching a major attack on the Party. In this letter, Fang Ran advised Hu Feng on how to adopt a cunning two-faced attitude to deceive the Party when attacking the Party, even suggesting that he submit an "application for party membership."

    Note: Hu Feng clique members and many other hidden counter-revolutionaries generally adopt Fang Ran's two-faced strategy in this letter, especially his ? and ? strategies, which can deceive many people. But they always have loopholes that can be found by people. The exposure of the Hu Feng clique is an example. Especially when the awareness and vigilance of the majority of people have been improved, their two-faced strategy is easier to be exposed.

25. August 29, 1954, Ou Yang Zhuang's letter to Hu Feng (from Nanjing)

    I have an idea, suggesting that you write a few more new characters to clarify your intentions and be open-minded ...

    [New characters] Ou Yang Zhuang advised Hu Feng to write a few more feature articles about heroes to serve as a cover for supporting the new society. From here, it can be fully seen that Hu Feng and Hu Feng members regard their hypocritical praise of the new society as a means to cover up their counter-revolutionary activities.

26. November 15, 1954, A Lang's letter to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

    The movement is long-term, and there will be one to two years of reckoning, starting with Hu Shi as the leader of the bourgeois academic thought.

    In the literary field, it is also starting like this.

    Therefore, I feel that, regarding the "schedule," first, we must seek an understanding, and then we can proceed. Two key points: it must not contradict the overall steps; it must not be blinded by smoke and miss the opportunity to raise the issue. There is a contradiction and difficulty here.

    If it contradicts the overall steps, it will give the impression of just a personal issue. People, of course, cannot say it is wrong. However, it will cause the business to encounter other obstacles.

    If it is blinded by smoke and misses the timely raising of the issue, it will also have the same result, causing the business to encounter obstacles.

    We must understand and study the situation.

    We must be good at following the overall steps to determine our steps.

    Liu Ge's arrival may be helpful.

    ["Schedule"] refers to the activity plan of the Hu Feng clique in the cultural circle during the criticism of Hu Shi. In the face of this struggle against bourgeois idealist thought, the counter-revolutionary activities of the Hu Feng clique encountered difficulties. They hated this struggle and called this struggle "smoke" and "smoke screen," but they did not dare to openly oppose this struggle. Therefore, A Lang advised Hu Feng: "Understand and study the situation," "be good at following the overall steps to determine our steps," meaning to follow the surface of this struggle and take the opportunity to attack the Party. [Liu Ge] refers to Lu Ding. At this time, Lu Ding came to Beijing to help Hu Feng plan their counter-revolutionary activities.

    Note: From here, one can also see the importance and necessity of our struggle against Hu Shi's bourgeois idealism. Some people claim to believe in Marxism-Leninism but do not attach importance to this struggle against idealism, or say they have no idealism, or say they have nothing to do with Hu Shi, so it is best to avoid it. But the Hu Feng clique is very concerned about it, and they are studying how to deal with it. "There is a contradiction and difficulty here." The criticism of idealism indeed gave the Hu Feng clique "contradiction and difficulty," which shows that the criticism is correct. Is there also "contradiction and difficulty" in the revolutionary ranks?

27. February 14, 1955, Zhang Zhongxiao's letter to Ji Heng (from Shanghai)

    It seems that we have entered the stage of showing our cards.

    Now we must do the following: First, everyone's problem is their own problem, and everything must be seen from their own labor; they cannot be mixed up with Gu Gong's problem, this is the premise. Second, when forced to speak, one can criticize Gu Gong; third, under this premise, one can check one's own work defects.

    Everything cannot deviate from this premise.

    Please inform Ju Ge when convenient, and I don't have time to write to him.

    [Showing our cards stage] refers to the criticism of Hu Feng's thoughts has been launched, and in Hu Feng's letter to Zhang Zhongxiao on January 20, 1955, he instructed the response to this criticism, that is, "regarding those who have friendship with me, that is a different matter from me, and it should be seen from each person's labor," that is, they should each find a way to deceive and pass the test. Zhang Zhongxiao conveyed Hu Feng's instructions to the Hu Feng members in this letter. [Friends] refers to the followers of the Hu Feng clique. [Gu Gong] refers to Hu Feng. [Ju Ge] refers to Fang Ran, also known as Zhu Sheng. 3. Hu Feng members used every means to infiltrate the Communist Party, obtain the title of party member, steal party documents, spy on party situations, report to Hu Feng, express unlimited loyalty to Hu Feng, and deceive the party, working together inside and outside to carry out various counter-revolutionary activities.

28. July 23, 1950, Lü Yuan's letter to Hu Feng (from Hankou)

    My probationary period will be completed in March this year, but it has not been fully resolved until today. I have sincerely written three reports, each more detailed and honest than the last. Except for the criticism of "literary thought" which is not satisfactory, the rest is generally qualified. This process is indeed a struggle for us.

    [Probationary period] refers to the probationary period of new party members in the Communist Party.

    Note: The infiltration of a large number of Hu Feng members into the Party to obtain the title of party members should be noted by all Party organizations. Lü Yuan, before liberation, had once infiltrated our underground party organization and later lost his party membership due to fleeing. In 1950, this counter-revolutionary infiltrated our party organization again and "wrote three reports, each more detailed and honest than the last," except for literary thought, "the rest is generally qualified," and was later accepted as a "party member." Such things, should they not be noted by all Party organizations? These counter-revolutionaries are deceiving us after using all their tricks to infiltrate the Party. They regard this as a "struggle" and they have won! They have come in!

29. June 24, 1951, Ou Yang Zhuang's letter to Hu Feng (from Nanjing)

    There is a comrade in Suzhou who can be talked to (working in the municipal committee, a party member). This person was struck in the early days of liberation ("liberalism"), and his fighting spirit may be weak, but it is worth a try.

    [A comrade in Suzhou] Ou Yang Zhuang reported to Hu Feng that he found a "contactable" person in Suzhou. They found party members who had made mistakes and regarded them as "talkable," that is, they were "controllable" objects.

    Note: The liberal tendencies of Communist Party members were criticized, and Hu Feng members called it "being struck." If this person's "fighting spirit" was not "weak" but "strong," that is, if this person insisted on the liberal stance, then this person would have the danger of being pulled away. Hu Feng members were going to "try" once. They had already called this person "comrade." Such a situation, should it not be a lesson? All Communist Party members with ideological and political errors, when they are criticized, should adopt what attitude? Here, there are two paths to choose from: one is to correct the error and become a good party member; the other is to degenerate and even fall into the counter-revolutionary pit. The latter path indeed exists, and counter-revolutionaries may be beckoning there!

30. January 30, 1952, Lu Ling's letter to Hu Feng (from Beijing)

    Regarding the news about Ding Ge, it is just a general telegram, right? I haven't seen it, and it is probably that some comrades, such as who, who, etc., defended the wrong thoughts. Ding Ge went back to Tianjin for the New Year, and when he returns, I will talk to him. His discussion meeting was not too bad, the leaders turned a bit, he also concealed a bit, and it slipped by, it seems that there will be no more trouble.

    [News about Ding Ge] "Ding Ge" refers to Lu Ding, a Hu Feng member who infiltrated the Party. In another letter to Hu Feng on January 20, Lu Ling mentioned that "the party magazine 'Construction' has published the saying that he (Lu Ding) 'defended' Mei Ge (A Lang), which seems to have been reported internally and passed up." The "news" and "telegram" mentioned here refer to this. The Hu Feng members who infiltrated the Party once stole the party magazine "Construction" and showed it to Hu Feng and Lu Ling. [His discussion meeting] refers to the party's discussion of Lu Ding's literary thoughts. In the letter to Hu Feng on January 20, Lu Ling reported that "Lu Ding was 'rectified' again," which also refers to this. [Concealed a bit] [Slipped by] all refer to Lu Ding's deception tactics.

    Note: From this kind of letter, we should be alert and not let them "slip by."

31. April 4, 1952, Lu Ding's letter to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

    I heard about the printed materials in Beijing, but I have no way to see them. If there is an opportunity to return to Beijing, I will go to Hui Jun's place to see if there is any.

    [Printed materials] refers to a certain party internal material. In a letter to Lu Ling on March 27 of the same year, Hu Feng ordered Lu Ling to order Yan Wang, Xu Fang, and Lu Ding to steal this material. From this letter and some following letters, one can see how Lu Ding followed Hu Feng's orders and used every means to steal this material. [Hui Jun] refers to Comrade Ai Ying.

32. April 7, 1952, Lu Ding's letter to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

    I saw the report on Chen's speech on Ai and others from Lu Ge, and from this, one can see that the leadership has fully felt the dogmatism in general theoretical work, and the figures being criticized are the so-called outstanding figures at present. ... Chen's report will be sent to you, and another copy will be sent to Ling Ge when going to Beijing, ...

    [Lu Ge] refers to Lu Li, a Hu Feng member who infiltrated the Communist Party. [Chen's speech on Ai and others] refers to a piece of party internal material. Hu Feng once ordered the Hu Feng member Lu Ding who infiltrated the Party to steal this material and give it to the Hu Feng clique. [Ling Ge] refers to Lu Ling.

33. April 18, 1952, Lu Ding's letter to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

    Did you receive the previous letter and the enclosed Chen's article? ... Mei Ge wrote from Hunan, saying that he can only return to Tianjin by the end of June, which is good, as the literary rectification in Tianjin will start on May 1st, and Mei Ge can avoid some unnecessary entanglements. I have not received a letter from Ning Ge recently, and I don't know his recent situation. ... I have sent Chen's article to Ning Ge by mail.

    [Chen's article] refers to the piece of party internal material mentioned in the previous letter. Lu Ding stole this material and gave it to Hu Feng and Lu Ling. [Mei Ge] refers to A Lang. [Ning Ge] refers to Lu Ling.

    Note: From this kind of letter, one can see that the hidden counter-revolutionaries in the revolutionary ranks are very afraid of rectification, which shows that rectification is beneficial. Those who are afraid of rectification are not all counter-revolutionaries. The absolute majority (more than 90%) are people who have made some ideological or political mistakes, and the policy towards them is to help them correct their mistakes. But counter-revolutionaries are very afraid of rectification, and the policy towards them is to further expose their counter-revolutionary roots. The true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was gradually exposed in the several rectifications before and after liberation, that is, the past several ideological struggles. Due to these rectifications, there was a split within the Hu Feng clique, forcing the Hu Feng clique to adopt the strategy of attacking to defend—300,000 words of petitioning and finally the big exposure.

34. May 7, 1952, Lu Ding's letter to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

    I saw the printed materials from Hui Jun's place, and I have shown them to Ning Ge. He will write to tell you the details.

    [Printed materials] refers to the piece of party internal material mentioned in the 31st letter.

    [Ning Ge] refers to Lu Ling.

35. June 9, 1952, Lu Ding's letter to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

    The printed materials have been received, and I have shown them to Ning Ge. He will write to tell you the details.

    [Printed materials] refers to the piece of party internal material mentioned in the 31st letter.

The following is a collection of letters exchanged between Hu Feng and his followers, revealing the counter-revolutionary nature of the Hu Feng clique. These letters were intercepted and published by the People's Daily to expose the true intentions and activities of the Hu Feng clique.

### 1952-06-29 Ke Dian to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

There is no need to waste time on that despicable soul. We need to focus on future actions. The policy of "pressing down" is essentially a policy of assassination, as they are unable to engage in a direct battle. This is their masterpiece. I believe we should express our stance to higher authorities, demand an open discussion, and request a meeting. If the higher authorities also endorse that verdict, then it becomes a "historical" issue. In the past, we suffered because we did not investigate thoroughly and underestimated the situation, acting too kindly. To be honest, I am so angry that my words are incoherent. Please consider this carefully.

[That despicable soul] refers to Shu Wu after his self-criticism. Ke Dian wrote this letter the day after the People's Daily published Shu Wu's self-criticism article.

[Pressing down] refers to the editorial note added by the People's Daily on June 8, 1952, when it published Shu Wu's self-criticism article. Ke Dian even cursed the editorial note of the central organ of the Communist Party as an "assassination policy."

[Higher authorities] refers to the Central Committee of the Communist Party.

Note: From these letters, we can see that in the face of the powerful revolutionary forces of the people, that is, the people's democratic dictatorship, as long as this dictatorship raises the consciousness of the masses and adopts correct policies, it can split even the most tightly organized counter-revolutionary groups. This split is beneficial to the people. Shu Wu's split from the Hu Feng clique caused the Hu Feng clique great trouble, which is a testament to this. Recently, many Hu Feng members across the country have voluntarily or under pressure handed over secret documents and exposed the truth, which is a continuation of this struggle.

### 1952-06-26 Hu Feng to Ke Dian

I received your letter dated June 26. I am very happy that there are people who dare to "stand up." However, in terms of methods, I suggest not signing jointly, as this can easily lead to accusations of forming a "small clique." Therefore, it is best for each person to write their own letter, taking responsibility for the issues they raise. This way, they will not implicate each other and fall into a passive position.

[Suggest not signing jointly] Hu Feng instructed his followers to organize a group of people to jointly write a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party, accusing the party's leaders in the literary field. Ke Dian here advises Hu Feng not to sign jointly to avoid exposing the face of the Hu Feng clique.

### 1952-10-20 Lu Yuan to Hu Feng (from Wuhan)

I sent a letter this morning and then received yours. It is like a whip, making me both hurt and sober. So far, I have not written anything. I wrote a piece, but it only talked about myself and did not meet the requirements, so I put it down. First, I blame myself for ignorance, lack of experience, and weak will. But that's okay, and I am struggling with myself. Please believe in my loyalty; I have no ulterior motives like Wu Zhi. However, my views and actions are almost disastrous, and I feel ashamed.

Wu Zhi first published an article, and here the concern for me began. From the three-anti campaign criticism, it was said to be only for internal self-criticism. But after the letter and the People's Daily's call to publish, it was said that I had to write an article to participate. I dragged it on, but I couldn't drag it any longer. I wrote a piece, but it did not pass. The main idea was: the past is the past, with limitations and weaknesses (my own); the important thing is the present, and now there is leadership. The whole article was from myself to myself. Now it is stuck, waiting for the responsible comrades to return from Beijing to say something. The general process is like this.

[Received your letter...] After Shu Wu published his "Open Letter to Lu Ling," he wrote to Lu Yuan asking for his opinion. Lu Yuan, in his reply to Shu Wu, was not firm enough in defending Hu Feng's reactionary "literary theory." Lu Ling saw this letter and told Hu Feng, who then wrote a letter severely reprimanding Lu Yuan and demanding that he "reply immediately and make it clearer." Lu Yuan immediately wrote this letter to Hu Feng, expressing his "loyalty" and explaining how he deceived the party and covered up for the Hu Feng clique.

[Written a piece] refers to Lu Yuan's fake self-criticism.

[Wu Zhi] sometimes written as "Wu Chi," both refer to Shu Wu after his self-criticism.

[Wu Zhi's first article] refers to Shu Wu's article "Learning from the 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' from the Beginning."

[The letter and the People's Daily's call] "The letter" refers to Shu Wu's "Open Letter to Lu Ling"; "The People's Daily's call" refers to the People's Daily's editorial note when it reprinted Shu Wang's self-criticism article.

### 1954-08-31 Fang Ran to Hu Feng (from Hangzhou)

I have not yet discussed the issue of writing something with Luo brother. If it is only about Cao Quan, it is simple; if it is more, then how can it avoid being similar and giving the impression of "attacking together"? What points should be raised? It needs to be discussed before starting. Luo brother's opinion is not to write much, just about Cao Quan; my opinion is to write more and focus on two key points. After considering it thoroughly, I will strive to complete it within September and send it to you for review first.

[Writing something] Hu Feng instructed his followers to write letters to the Central Committee of the Communist Party to "accuse" the party's leaders in the literary field. Fang Ran and Luo Luo (referred to as "Luo brother" in the letter) were both candidate party members (later stripped of their candidate party member status due to their bad character) and were carrying out this conspiracy under Hu Feng's instruction from within the party.

[Cao Quan] refers to Comrade Shao Quanlin. Fang Ran planned to attack Comrade Shao Quanlin in his letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party.

### 1954-10-11 Fang Ran to Hu Feng (from Hangzhou)

I have finished writing the letter to Lu. After discussing it with Zhong brother, I am somewhat hesitant: ① The content of the letter only discusses one issue, which is "completely defending Hu," and the tone is too harsh; ② It is sudden and seems coordinated. Zhong brother's opinion is to delay sending it, but I think, forget it, I will copy and send it within a few days.

[Lu] refers to Comrade Lu Dingyi. Fang Ran's "accusation" letter was indeed sent to Comrade Lu Dingyi.

[Zhong brother] refers to Hu Feng's follower Ji Hong.

[Defending Hu] means defending Hu Feng.

[Seems coordinated] This sentence and the previous sentence's mention of "avoiding similarity and the impression of 'attacking together'" show their fear of the party discovering that their attacks are organized and planned.

### 1955-01-28 Ou Yang Zhuang to Hu Feng (from Nanjing)

I am sending you a set of notes for reference. This is a party directive transmitted by Comrade Lin Mo Han to the Party Group of the Ministry of Higher Education.

[Notes] refers to a party directive, transmitted by Comrade Lin Mo Han on December 11, 1954, to the Party Group of the Ministry of Higher Education. Ou Yang Zhuang stole these notes from the transmission and sent them to Hu Feng. This letter includes nine pages of carbon copies of the full notes.

Note: From these letters, we can see that there are people stealing secrets in our organizations, troops, enterprises, or groups. These people are counter-revolutionary elements infiltrating these organizations, troops, enterprises, or groups, and some liberal elements are good friends of these counter-revolutionary elements. Shouldn't this situation be a serious concern for all workers and the people?

The Hu Feng clique, from their counter-revolutionary stance and reactionary "theory," defames the party's literary policy and cultural policy, hates the party's criticism of bourgeois ideology and propaganda of Marxism-Leninism.

### 1951-08-22 Zhang Zhong Xiao to Hu Feng (from Shaoxing)

To write, I read "On Literature and Art" by Mao. But after reading it, I didn't want to write. Now I will tell you some of my opinions on this book:

The writer and the object struggle in the creative process. I feel this is the dividing line between true and false realism, but he only says: "observe, experience, study, analyze," how cold!

The "utilitarianism" and so on. This standard suppresses true criticism and suppresses new things. Regarding the three sections on "exposure" and "praise," they are wrong. This is a purely formal understanding and mechanical view. I dislike the terms "exposure" and "praise" (this meaning should be opposite to "exposure"). I feel it should be rewritten as pain, joy, pursuit, and dreams. I feel that realism should drive out these vulgar and evil terms.

Regarding the section on Lu Xun's miscellaneous writings, it is completely wrong. Miscellaneous writings are a sharp hoe that digs out all new ideas from the demands of real life. If it is only seen as "under the rule of dark forces, without freedom of speech, hence fighting with satirical miscellaneous writings" is "correct," then it fundamentally does not understand Lu Xun.

Of course, there are still several other points. The above points I feel are particularly important and deeply feel they are wrong. Overall, the essence of the book is anti-realism!

This book may have been useful in Yan'an, but now, I feel it is not. According to the current situation, it can kill living beings. No wonder the sycophants worship it like a totem!

For example, "observe, experience, study, analyze..." Qiao Mu has quoted it.

Of course, there are some correct points, such as "not writing philosophical treatises in works," and what you quoted on page 10 of "On the Road of Realism." But I feel these should be common sense of Marxism-Leninism.

I really can't imagine what those who think this book is the "most complete" literary policy and preach to others are thinking!

[Mao's "On Literature and Art"] refers to Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Hu Feng's follower Zhang Zhong Xiao, in this letter, defames many contents of this great work by Comrade Mao Zedong and slanders this book as "anti-realism" and "killing living beings." [Sycophants] is a derogatory term used by Hu Feng's followers to refer to revolutionary cadres and revolutionary literary workers. [Totem] in primitive society, people worshipped a certain animal or other natural object as sacred, and this worshipped object was called a "totem." [Qiao Mu] refers to Comrade Qiao Guan Hua, who in 1948 used the pen name "Qiao Mu" to write an article titled "Literary Creation and Subjectivity," criticizing Hu Feng's literary thoughts.

Note: From this letter, we can see that the Hu Feng clique firmly opposes the literary direction determined by the Communist Party and hates Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Because the party and Comrade Mao Zedong call on literary workers to sing the praises of workers, peasants, and soldiers and to expose the enemies of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Hu Feng clique is precisely the enemy of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They feel that exposing the enemies of workers, peasants, and soldiers will make them unable to survive and will "kill" them and their so-called "new things." But they do not dare to openly oppose this speech and even instruct their followers to "follow it" and sometimes quote some of its sentences. These are the disguises of the Hu Feng followers. But in this secret letter, their true face of hating this speech and opposing the party is completely exposed. Zhang Zhong Xiao said: "This book (referring to Comrade Mao Zedong's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'), may have been useful in Yan'an, but now, I feel it is not." "Now it is not useful," in the literary circle, isn't there still someone who has said this? Those who have said this kind of thing, please read Zhang Zhong Xiao's letter carefully! Of course, some who say this kind of thing are still holding bourgeois literary views and therefore cannot recognize the importance of this speech. But the Hu Feng follower, Zhang Zhong Xiao, with his counter-revolutionary sensitivity, deeply understands that this speech, after the national liberation, will grasp the masses in an even wider range and have a destructive effect on various reactionary literary thoughts. Therefore, they are eager to stop and sabotage the expansion of the influence of this speech. Their so-called "now... it is not useful," the reason is here.

### 1951-02-14 Zhang Zhong Xiao to Hu Feng (from Shaoxing)

Regarding the current situation, I personally discovered a very serious phenomenon, that is, the current public opinion has a "reactionary" tendency. At least, consciously or unconsciously, it compromises with old things and secretly advocates "Eastern spiritual civilization." Scholars are trying to "praise China's historical culture and civilization," but they forget that they will become mummies.

Of course, these will disappear like bubbles in the great tide of the people. But at present, it is a serious fact that in the abstract of workers, peasants, and soldiers and vulgar patriotism, how much vitality is being destroyed...

As for its manifestation in propaganda, it is even more despicable... turning the butcher's cruelty into a smile!

["Reactionary" tendency] Hu Feng's followers hate China's cultural heritage and hate the patriotism of the people, so they slander our public opinion as having a "reactionary" tendency and "secretly advocating 'Eastern spiritual civilization'." [Mummy] ancient Egyptians used spices to embalm the dead body to prevent it from decaying, and this dead body is called a "mummy." Hu Feng's followers here curse those who conduct patriotic education as becoming corpses.

### 1951-07-17 Zhang Zhong Xiao to Mei Zhi (from Shaoxing)

"Literary World" saw an article by someone named Xiao Dai, who seems to want me to "start from reality."

I forgot where I saw it, but this person named Xiao originally participated in the editing of "Youth Literature" with Mei Lin and Yuan Hua, whether friend or foe, is still uncertain. But regarding you, I will casually talk: I feel that the "Wu Xun Transmission" issue, if you want to gain something, you must not talk about reform or surrenderism, but should focus on Sun Yu. But this person named Xiao says my proposal will weaken the debate, as if you must criticize Wu Xun from "theory" (?) to enrich or develop the debate. But in fact, what role can Wu Xun play? Our current "whats" are not more servile than Wu Xun? Xiao's so-called "development" (?) is just empty talk with eyes to the sky and feet off the ground. If we really follow his proposed "reality" to start, I am afraid besides wasting paper and ink, there will be nothing else.

This kind of article that does not consider strategic requirements, I think must be the enemy.

Can Wang Yuan Hua be trusted? Can we freely discuss something? Reading his letter is enthusiastic, but seems a bit fake. Of course, one letter cannot determine a person, but to avoid unnecessary trouble, it is necessary to be careful.

["Literary World"] is the supplement of the "Wenhui Daily" in Shanghai. [Xiao Dai] is a literary worker in Shanghai. Hu Feng's follower Zhang Zhong Xiao, in this letter, defames the party's significant "Wu Xun Transmission" criticism movement and asks Hu Feng who are their "friends" and who are their "enemies." [Yuan Hua] is Wang Yuan Hua, who was then working at the Shanghai New Literature Publishing House.

### 1952-06-16 A Ling to Mei Zhi (from Tianjin)

Recently, I have been quite busy. There are more affairs, and I have participated in some symposiums, such as the Wu Xun symposium. Sometimes it is funny, those old gentlemen, after singing hymns for an hour, turn around and become unrecognizable, to the extent that they have to use the innocent repentance of others to wash their own bath. So it is not funny, too despicable. Luo brother sent some materials, which seem to indicate that Shanghai is a chaotic center.

[Those old gentlemen] is a derogatory term used by the Hu Feng clique to refer to party and non-party revolutionary cadres. A Ling, in this letter, uses the fact that some revolutionary cadres had mistakenly praised "Wu Xun Transmission" to slander and oppose the party's criticism of "Wu Xun Transmission." [Luo brother] refers to Luo Luo, a member of the Hu Feng clique.

### 1950-11-15 Zhang Zhong Xiao to Hu Feng (from Shanghai)

...But in newspapers and periodicals, it is all mechanical theory, such as "Learning." I have also thought about it, and on the 21st of last month, I wrote to "Learning," raising questions...

According to my idea, it should be a movement in the entire ideological field... otherwise, if mechanical theory monopolizes, even if a great work is born, people will not have the strength to feel it. Now it seems to be the most popular time for old tastes plus mechanical theory! No matter in what field!

["Learning"] refers to the "Learning" magazine. [In the entire ideological field] refers to launching an attack on the entire revolutionary ideological field.

### The Hu Feng clique members unanimously use various malicious and vulgar words to curse the party's leadership in the revolutionary literary field, curse revolutionary literary workers and their works, and curse the party and the revolutionary literary field's criticism of them.

### 1951-12-27 Ke Dian to Lu Yuan (from Tianjin)

Today, in the field of literature and art, there is hardly a piece of clean land. Those who hold the banner or are grabbing the banner are rarely not petty bourgeois. Because of this, the battle is determined to be arduous and long-term.

Note: From these letters, we can see that the attack on a few people by counter-revolutionary elements is just an excuse, a strategy. Their real intention is "hardly a piece of clean land." Because of this situation, they "determine the arduousness and long-term nature of the battle." Since the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, when Wu Wang Liu Pi invented the famous strategy of asking to kill Li Ling (a key figure in Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty) to clean the court, many ambitious people have regarded it as a treasure. The Hu Feng clique has also inherited this legacy. In their 300,000-word petition, they only attacked Lin Mo Han, He Qi Fang, and Zhou Yang and a few others, saying that these few people ruined everything. Some people, in their class instincts, sympathize with Hu Feng and blindly praise him, saying that this is just a struggle for leadership between Zhou Yang and Hu Feng. We must pay attention to this point in the struggle to eliminate Hu Feng elements and other counter-revolutionary elements.

### 1950-04-05 Lu Yuan to Hu Feng (from Wuhan)

The day before yesterday, I saw Mei's "Notice," which is very painful. I originally thought I did not need to speak, but it seems that there are some admonitions and considerations. Mei is too sincere and frank, unable to bear such threatening slander; but I feel that it is better to counterattack those who show their true colors. After seeing Shi's "Proclamation," I wrote a short article and wanted to send it; but to reduce trouble here and also seeing Mei's "Letter," I put it down. The situation has changed, and the method of struggle should also change; the essence of the object is still the same, but the clothes have changed seasons. We must first stand firm and strive to reduce the misunderstanding of the innocent and naive, not to expand this possibility...

Regarding some who are ignorant of the past and naive "mantises," it is nothing; what is despicable is some "lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha immediately" crawling worms!

[Mei's Notice] [Mei's Letter] "Mei" refers to A Ling. "Notice" and "Letter" both refer to the letter A Ling wrote to the People's Daily acknowledging his mistakes in March 1950. [Those who show their true colors] refers to party member writers and non-party progressive writers. [Shi's "Proclamation"] refers to Comrade Shi Du's article criticizing A Ling, published in the People's Daily in March 1950. [Mantises] refers to revolutionary young literary workers. [Crawling worms] refers to literary workers who accept the party's literary direction and are willing to reform themselves.

### 1951-06-21 Lu Yuan to Hu Feng (from Wuhan)

...The main thing is that I am about to become a "scallop." From morning to night, thinking about this and researching that, it is all about those "laws of development."...

I am shocked that I am still living in the heavy Asian stupor, truly "those who enter the fish market do not smell the fish." Stupor itself is not to be feared, but what is to be feared is that stupor infects the awakened things. It is originally the time of "shouting loudly," but "shouting loudly" only has "one shout," and the rest is just a humming echo that makes one want to sleep. These humming people even think they are also "shouting loudly" and must be listened to unconditionally. As a result, the stupor is more at ease, as if there is a guarantee. You understand this completely.

["Scallop"] in ancient China, there was a saying: "Entering the fish market, one does not smell the fish." Scallop is a stinking fish. Lu Yuan here curses our entire revolutionary team as "scallops."

### 1952-04-01 Lu Yuan to Hu Feng (from Wuhan)

The incident itself has nothing to do with me, but it is actually trying to drag me into it. This kind of ambiguous attitude is just a prelude, of course, I will not care. If it is pulled open, I will not be afraid either. Although I have only studied Marxism-Leninism for a few days, it is enough to deal with these old gentlemen.

[The incident itself...] At this time, the entire literary circle is carrying out the rectification movement. Lu Yuan works in the "Changjiang Daily" and the newspaper asks him to examine his thoughts. In this letter, he shows his counter-revolutionary hostile attitude. [Studied Marxism-Leninism for a few days...] This sentence exposes that Hu Feng's followers sometimes randomly quote some Marxist-Leninist phrases, and their purpose is to oppose the party and Marxism-Leninism.

### 1947-04-03 Lu Ling to Hu Feng (from Nanjing)

Have you seen that old man's cherry tree and other bastard articles? Brother Ji directly wrote a letter to him and scolded him. But silence is also equally "pleasant."

[That old man's cherry tree and other bastard articles] "Old man" refers to Comrade Guo Moruo. Guo Moruo at this time published an article in "Wenhui Daily" criticizing Hu Feng's followers Gong Yong and Ri Mu, titled "Remembering the Story of Chopping Down the Cherry Tree." First, Gong Yong wrote an article "A Little Uneasy," and Ri Mu wrote an article "From the Bad Wind in the Literary Circle," attacking Ba Jin, Tang Tao, and other comrades. Guo Moruo's article uses the story of George Washington, the first president of the United States, chopping down a cherry tree in his youth as an analogy to criticize Hu Feng's followers for attacking progressive writers. This well-intentioned criticism was met with vulgar and unworthy curses from Hu Feng's followers Lu Ling and Ji Hong (Ji Hong's letter is seen later). [Brother Ji] refers to Ji Hong.

### 1947-06-24 Ji Hong to Hu Feng (from Nanjing)

Today, I read Guo Moruo's "Remembering the Story of Chopping Down the Cherry Tree" in "Wenhui Daily," which really made me speechless. He is simply like the emperor of the literary world, issuing edicts there... Throughout the world, from ancient times to the present, there has never been such a lawyer and litigator! Truly a bastard, a son of a bitch! I want to send a letter to him directly and "offend" the emperor's dignity a little. It really makes one angry. The faces and hearts of these people are reflected in a funhouse mirror, very strange!

["Remembering the Story of Chopping Down the Cherry Tree"] This is the title of Guo Moruo's article criticizing Gong Yong and Ri Mu, published in "Wenhui Daily," see the annotation of the previous 50th letter.

### 19××-××-×× Li Deng Tai to Hu Feng

Zhi Fang brother is nearby, and I often approach him. From him, I have also been elevated. His life content is truly complex, and there are some places I do not believe he can do such things. We have analyzed Mr. Guo Moruo in detail, and the conclusion is "the evil child of Chinese culture in the past hundred years."

I have seen Li You Cai's board talk, which is propaganda produced from dogma. The characters in real life also act according to dogma...

[Li Deng Tai] Hu Feng clique member and spy, already sentenced. [Zhi Fang brother] refers to Jia Zhi Fang. [Li You Cai's board talk] refers to Comrade Zhao Shu Li's novel "Li You Cai's Board Talk."

### 1947-05-07 Lu Ling to Hu Feng (from Nanjing)

The script will start rehearsals next week... It is indeed good, and Wan Jia Bao will invite me to "play" this Sunday. I am prepared to "play," but with such a hypocrite, there is nothing to say. I will not make them "happy" either.

[Script] refers to Lu Ling's reactionary play "Lark," which was then performed by the theater troupe led by Hu Feng's follower Huang Ruo Hai in Nanjing. Hu Feng wrote an article praising it and personally went to Nanjing to "boost morale." [Wan Jia Bao] refers to the playwright Cao Yu. Lu Ling, in another letter to Hu Feng, insults Cao Yu, saying: "Wan Cai Zi met, extremely boring!" and so on.

### 1950-06-15 Lu Ling to Hu Feng (from Beijing)

I read Lao She's script yesterday. It is very bad. I think this is one of his headaches. But of course, it will be performed. Yesterday, after listening to the recitation of this script, I was quite happy with schadenfreude, thinking that I can give the theory of comedy a blow.

[Lao She's script] refers to "Fang Zhen Zhu," which was performed by the China Youth Art Theater. Hu Feng's follower Lu Ling is happy with the flaws in this play.

[He] refers to Comrade Liao Cheng Zhi, the then director of the China Youth Art Theater.

Note: From these letters, we can see that the Hu Feng clique, in their 300,000-word petition and all their other public statements, seem to be mainly opposing the Communist Party's writers and not opposing others. They, of course, never oppose Chiang Kai-shek and other figures of the Nationalist Party (only sometimes curse a few words as a cover, that is, the so-called "small curse, big help"), but not opposing others is false. Originally, they despise, curse, and oppose Lu Xun, Wen Yi Duo, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, Huang Yao Mian, Cao Yu, Lao She, and these many revolutionaries and democratic personages. This kind of not recognizing anyone outside their own clique is not the style of Chiang Kai-shek's fascist Nationalist Party?

### 1946-05-18 Ji Hong to Hu Feng (from Nanjing)

Recently, I want to publish a poetry magazine. To fight, you must have a base. Striking east and west will not have results. And "Tu-style" poetry and "dialect poetry" are so arrogant, just like the stage is full of demons and ghosts, and the music stage is full of "strange songs" and "bull's head not matching the horse's mouth."

["Tu-style" poetry and "dialect poetry"] Ji Hong insults poetry, drama, and mass songs that exposed the Nationalist Party's reactionary rule before liberation, showing that the Hu Feng clique is full of hostility towards anti-Nationalist Party literary works before liberation. Here, "Tu-style" poetry and "dialect poetry" refer to the poetry against the Nationalist Party written by Comrade Ma Fan Tu and others at that time. "Strange songs" and "bull's head not matching the horse's mouth" are two songs that were very popular in the Nationalist Party's ruled areas at that time, exposing the rotten and reactionary rule of the Nationalist Party, cursing the Nationalist Party's spies running rampant, persecuting the people, and carrying out anti-people civil war. At that time, the masses often sang these songs when holding meetings and parades.

### 1948-05-23 Zhu Guo Hui to Hu Feng

Yesterday, I borrowed "People and Literature" from a friend and briefly read a few articles, feeling that those bastards are becoming more and more crazy.

["People and Literature"] This is one of the "Mass Literature Series" published in Hong Kong under the party's leadership in 1948, which includes articles criticizing the Hu Feng clique.

### 1953-09-01 Fang Ran to Ni Zi Ming, Wang Jing Bo (from Hangzhou)

...Some things, in terms of their content, tendency, and influence, are really intolerable, such as "Three Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains"... and so on. As a reader, one cannot remain silent. We cannot let corpses and ghosts calmly and triumphantly control people's emotions!

["Three Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains"] refers to Comrade Yang Zhao's novel reflecting the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

### 1955-01-11 Li Zheng Lian to Hu Feng (from Shanghai)

You can imagine the noise I have heard in these days, making even the only ear that can appreciate music deaf. The discordant sounds here and there, and the lack of tonality, really make one curse...

[Noise] refers to the criticism of Hu Feng.

### 1955-02-16 Hua Tian to Gong Yong (from Nanjing)

Here, I am about to make a situation of criticizing the manifestation of bourgeois literary thought in teaching. Someone is already pointing and gesturing, demanding that I do so. The terrible "Niu Er Bu Dao" style of wind has spread. Really boring. You say it is eating too much and having nothing to do, but it is not; you say it is a character that likes to join the crowd, but it is not entirely that; it is strange and deformed.

I am shallow, but I still have a conscience. I will "drag" for one more day. Endurance is still needed!

[Here] refers to the Nanjing Industrial Accounting Statistics School. Hua Tian teaches Chinese at this school. [Niu Er Bu Dao] refers to the story in "Water Margin" where Yang Zhi sells a sword and the thug Niu Er bullies him without reason, and Yang Zhi kills Niu Er in anger. Here, the Hu Feng clique member Hua Tian compares our criticism of bourgeois ideology to the bullying of a thug.

### The Hu Feng clique is crazy with hatred for the people's democratic dictatorship and the new society, dreaming of the destruction of the Communist Party and the people's revolutionary government.

### 195×-05-23 A Ling to Luo Luo (from Tianjin)

Good, let people go crazy, and let them perish in their craziness.

### 195×-07-31 A Ling to Luo Luo (from Tianjin)

This is also good. The grave is dug deeper and deeper, and the stage is built higher and higher; so, if one side is a deep grave and the other side is a high stage, one will fall to their doom when they fall down.

### 195×-06-20 Ke Dian to Hu Feng (from Tianjin)

Currently, those yellow leaves are falling one by one, falling on the sprouts, trying to smother the sprouts. But they do not realize that they themselves are rotting; they do not realize that the sprouts are breaking through their rotting corpses and growing vigorously. Of course, some fragile sprouts will be smothered.

[Yellow leaves] [They themselves are rotting] [Rotting corpses] These are all the Hu Feng clique's slander of our revolutionary team.

[Sprouts] This is the Hu Feng clique referring to themselves.

Note: Just as we often estimate the situation of the international and domestic class struggle, the enemy also often estimates this situation. But our enemy is a backward, rotten, and reactionary group, destined to perish. They do not understand the laws of the objective world, and the methods they use to think are subjective and metaphysical. Therefore, their estimates are always wrong. Their class instincts guide them to always think: they are so great, while the revolutionary forces are no good. They always overestimate their strength and underestimate ours. We have seen many counter-revolutionaries: the Qing government, the Beiyang warlords, Japanese militarism, Mussolini, Hitler, Chiang Kai-shek, one by one, they have fallen. They have made and cannot avoid making mistakes in their thoughts and actions. The current imperialists will definitely make this kind of mistake. Isn't this funny? According to the Hu Feng clique, the revolutionary forces led by the Communist Party are to "perish," and this force is just "yellow leaves" and "rotting corpses." And the counter-revolutionary forces represented by the Hu Feng clique? Although "some fragile sprouts will be smothered," a large number of sprouts will "break through" something and grow vigorously. If, as some say, there are still representatives of the Bourbon dynasty in the French National Assembly today, then after the complete annihilation of all exploiting classes on Earth for many years, it is very likely that there will still be representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek regime active in various places. The most hard-core among these people will never admit their defeat. This is because they need to deceive others and also need to deceive themselves, otherwise they cannot live. We see, why is the Hu Feng clique so arrogantly funny? Originally, they are walking according to the tune of their class instincts.

### 1952-02-03 Niu Han to Hu Feng (from Shenyang)

Perhaps after a few decades, I think that in China, people will have no contradictions; the dignity and truth of people will not be damaged. Today, however, because a person is dignified and truthful, they are damaged... Today, in China, people still do not respect each other, people still defile each other. People still do not respect a laborer, people still do not respect the creation of one's own labor. This is China's shame. I am very angry.

Note: This Hu Feng follower is quite pessimistic. He says "perhaps" after "a few decades" it will be possible for "people to have no contradictions," which means that there is hope for the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek regime after a few decades. After a few decades, the Chiang Kai-shek regime returns, and all revolutionary forces are suppressed, then "people will have no contradictions." "The dignity and truth of people will not be damaged," this "person" refers to all counter-revolutionary people, including the Hu Feng followers, but does not include a single revolutionary person. "Today, in China, people still do not respect each other..." The upper person refers to revolutionary people, and the lower person refers to counter-revolutionary people. The Hu Feng followers write articles, even in writing secret letters, and there will be some illogical sentences. This is also determined by their class nature, and they cannot, like us when we annotate for them, make the logic very clear.

### 1950-04-16 Xie Tao to Hu Feng (from Beijing)

For the past two weeks, I have really become a teacher, teaching all day. The new teaching method makes people exhausted. Teaching is originally a job that uses the brain, but now it has become almost completely unnecessary to use the brain.

[New teaching method] Hu Feng follower Xie Tao teaches at Renmin University of China, and here he openly opposes the new education method and slanders today's education work as "unnecessary to use the brain."

### 1951-02-18 Zhang Zhong Xiao to Hu Feng

I have always been suspicious of so-called "organizational life." What is required there is the "average score of thought"; the training method is probably not far from Hitler's. After training, it is not necessary to say that the spirit is messed up.

I think that some of the things A. Gide said in that book are quite appropriate for now.

[Not far from Hitler] "Hitler" refers to Hitler. Zhang Zhong Xiao slanders our training of cadres as similar to Hitler. [A. Gide said in that book...] The French declining bourgeois writer A. Gide wrote a book "Returning from the Soviet Union," shamelessly slandering and opposing the Soviet Union. The Hu Feng follower Zhang Zhong Xiao thinks it can be used to slander New China, which fully exposes the Hu Feng clique's hatred for New China.

### 1951-05-25 Zhang Zhong Xiao to Hu Feng (from Shaoxing)

You have not written an article. But I also feel that silence in a certain environment is enough to perish.

Of course, I know that your not writing an article is a matter of estimating the enemy situation and strategic and tactical issues.

I know that the whole of China has undergone a thorough upheaval; and those feudal forces are crazily killing people. The breadth of the scope is unprecedented in history, and the events that have occurred are also unprecedented. The struggle must inevitably deepen.

Note: The "those feudal forces are crazily killing people" in this letter is the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's expression of horror at our country's people's revolutionary forces' great struggle to suppress counter-revolutionary forces, which represents all counter-revolutionary classes, groups, and individuals. The things they are horrified by are precisely the things that the revolutionary masses are happy about. "Unprecedented in history" is also correct. All previous revolutions, except for the replacement of the slave system by the primitive commune system, which was the replacement of a non-exploitative system by an exploitative system, were all the replacement of one exploitative system by another exploitative system. They had no need and no possibility to carry out a thorough suppression of counter-revolutionary forces. Only we, only the proletarian revolution led by the Communist Party and the people's masses, is a revolution aimed at the final elimination of any exploitative system and any class. The classes that are eliminated will inevitably come out to resist through their counter-revolutionary parties, groups, or individuals, and the people's masses must unite to resolutely, thoroughly, and completely suppress these resisting forces. Only at this time, is there such a necessity, and only at this time, is there such a possibility. "The struggle must inevitably deepen," this is also correct. It is just that the words "feudal forces" are wrong, which is the opposite of the phrase "the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and the Communist Party based on the worker-peasant alliance." Just as their so-called "mechanism" is the opposite of "dialectical materialism."

### 1950-07-27 Zhang Zhong Xiao to Hu Feng (from Shaoxing)

I have written some miscellaneous writings and poems in the past, and now that my body is a bit better, I plan to write again. In the past two years, my temper has changed a lot, almost hating everyone... I hate this social order.

Note: It is still this Zhang Zhong Xiao, whose counter-revolutionary feelings are very acute, compared to many in our revolutionary ranks, including some Communist Party members, the high and low of class consciousness, and the sharpness of political sensitivity, are greatly different. In this comparison, many of our people, compared to the people in the Hu Feng clique, are far behind. Our people must learn, must raise their class alertness, and their political sensitivity must be more acute. If the Hu Feng clique can give us something positive, it is to raise our political awareness and political sensitivity through this shocking struggle, to resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionary elements, and to make our revolutionary dictatorship greatly consolidated, so as to carry out the revolution to the end and achieve the goal of building a great socialist country.

### 关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料

1955-06-10
第2版()
专栏：

    关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料
    编者按：胡风反革命集团第一、第二两批材料的公布，激起了全国广大人民群众对反革命分子的极大的愤怒。人们要求追究胡风集团的政治背景。他们问：胡风的主子究竟是谁？关于这个问题，人民政府已经获得大批材料。其中的一部分，我们把它放在这个“第三批材料”中发表出来。胡风和胡风集团中的许多骨干分子很早以来就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，他们和帝国主义国民党特务机关有密切联系，长期地伪装革命，潜藏在进步人民内部，干着反革命勾当。
    在下面的材料中，人们可以看出那被胡风捧为“追求革命十多年的革命作家”的阿垅和自称追随革命二十年的胡风本人的真实面目。阿垅在一封给胡风的信里，对蒋介石在一九四六年七月开始的在全国范围发动的反革命内战“充满了乐观”；认为中国人民解放军的“主力”“三个月可以击破”，“一年肃清”；并对蒋贼的“训话”，加以无耻的吹嘘，说什么“他底自信”“使大家更为鼓舞”。阿垅把人民革命力量看做是“脓”，认为“总要排出”，并认为进攻人民革命力量必须坚决彻底，“一不做，二不休”！
    他们为什么这样坚决呢？原来胡风，阿垅等人都是别有来历的人物。
    阿垅，即陈亦门、陈守梅，浙江人。原是国民党的军官，抗日初期混入延安抗日军政大学读了几个月，不上前线，却到胡宗南的“战干四团”做少校军事教官去了。这里发表的一封信是他在一九四六年七月从重庆山洞陆军大学写的，他已从胡宗南那里转到这里受训，毕业后任战术教官。“山洞”这个地方，是蒋介石的陆军大学所在，也是蒋介石本人在重庆期间的住地。
    胡风，即张光人、又名谷非，湖北人。在第一次国内革命战争时期，他曾经加入过共产主义青年团。一九二五年他在北京，当时段祺瑞统治下的白色恐怖把他吓昏了头脑，坚决要求党允许他退出了团。后在江西“剿共”军中做过反共的政治工作，又去日本混了一个时候，干了一些不可告人的勾当。回国以后，他在上海混进了左翼文化团体，从内部进行了种种分裂破坏活动。在武汉和重庆时期，他和国民党的许多特务头子有联系。从这里发表的胡风给阿垅的一封信里，也可看出胡风和国民党特务头子之一的陈焯的关系。胡风的这篇简单的历史是最近才查明的。因为他隐瞒得很巧妙，大家被他骗过了。
    胡风集团在全国解放以前狂热地把希望寄托在蒋介石反人民内战的胜利和人民革命力量的失败上；而当蒋匪溃败，全国解放以后，他们就潜伏在大陆上以更加阴险的两面派手法继续进行反革命活动。
    他们对解放后的新社会、对人民革命政权，表现了刻骨的仇恨，他们说“对这个社会秩序，我憎恨”，他们诅咒人民革命政权的“灭亡”“完蛋”！
    当本报公布了第一、二批揭露材料之后，还有一些人在说：胡风集团不过是文化界少数野心分子的一个小集团，他们不一定有什么反动政治背景。说这样话的人们，或者是因为在阶级本能上衷心地同情他们；或者是因为政治上嗅觉不灵，把事情想得太天真了；还有一部分则是暗藏的反动分子，或者就是胡风集团里面的人，例如北京的吕荧。
    现在，已到了彻底弄清胡风这一批反革命黑帮的面目的时候了，中国人民再也不容许他们继续玩弄欺骗手段！全国人民必须提高警惕！一切暗藏的反革命分子必须揭露！他们的反革命罪行必须受到应有的惩处！
    一、胡风和胡风集团分子同国民党特务机关早就有密切联系，胡风阿垅等是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗，他们衷心拥护或者积极参与了蒋匪发动的反人民的内战，他们妄想“肃清”中国人民解放军，对中国人民革命的胜利表现了强烈的仇恨和恐惧
    一、一九四七年九月二十六日胡风给阿垅信（自上海）
    就是陈卓，他去年做过北平警局长的。望马上找他恳托，至祷。直兄消息全无。但我担保他毫无此种姻缘，此点可向陈报告。我疑为寄居他家之小女人（近来彼此闹翻）所为，一则以上信所说学生事，一则以直为文人，如此而已。请陈马上进行（疑在中字处），让他们回来，万一困难，也得先让太太回来，一家庭妇女，留之不放，可笑之至。
    〔陈卓〕即陈焯，国民党特务头子之一。胡风分子贾植芳在一九四七年因误会被国民党逮捕。误捕的原因，据胡风在给阿垅的另一信中说，是因为贾植芳“住的地方他住进之前有几个学生住过，他沿用过他们定的信箱”。胡风写信给阿垅，要阿垅去找陈焯，向陈“报告”，胡风“担保”贾植芳同革命“毫无姻缘”。从这些信里可以看出胡风及其集团分子同国民党特务们的亲密关系。〔直兄〕即贾植芳。〔中字处〕指国民党“中统”特务机关。信内“陈”均指陈焯。“中统”为“国民党中央调查统计局”的简称。
    二、一九四七年九月二十八日胡风给阿垅信（自上海）
    直兄太太昨天回来了，有电话来。只是他们房子住过学生的事情，陈来电证明就可以回来云。她当然要直接找人求陈，你们那面如果关系好，也可催促，我以为愈快愈好，免得梦多。
    〔陈〕指陈焯。（信中旁点原有，下同。）
    三、一九四七年十月一日胡风给阿垅信（自上海）
    信收到。昨天去看了任敏。情形当然毫无严重之处（就是学生的事情），（他们对他很客气），不知能否马上回来。那是中字方面的，她在这里找同方面的人。
    〔任敏〕贾植芳之妻。〔中字方面〕指国民党“中统”，即“国
         民党中央调查统计局”的简称。〔同方面的人〕即同是“中统”
         方面的人。
    四、一九四六年七月十五日阿垅给胡风信（自重庆山洞陆军大学）
    至于大局，这里一切充满了乐观。那么，也告诉你乐观一下。三个月可以击破主力，一年肃清。曾经召集了一个独立营长以上的会，训话，他底自信也使大家更为鼓舞。同时，这里的机械部队空运济南，反战车部队空运归绥。一不做，二不休，是脓，总要排出！
    〔他〕指蒋贼。
      按：从这一类信里可以看出，胡风集团不是一个简单的“文艺”集团，而是一个以“文艺”为幌子的反革命政治集团。他们仇恨一切人民革命力量。胡风分子张中晓说，他“几乎恨一切人”。许多人认为“胡风不过是一个文化人，胡风事件不过是文化界的事件，和其他各界没有关系”，看了这类材料，应当觉悟过来了罢！
    五、一九四四年五月十三日绿原给胡风信（自重庆）
    我已被调至中美合作所工作，地点在磁器口，十五号到差；航委会不去了。
    ……这边美国人极多，生活或者有点改变。
    我仿佛真的开始做人了，处世确是不易，正如您说的：赤膊上阵不是我们底战术。以后，我觉得应该学习一点“阴暗的聪明”（？），我所畏惧的只是我自己。
    六、一九四七年九月二十三日绿原给阿垅、刘德馨信（自武汉）
    柏寒兄来信，谓万恶的共匪搅动他的故乡，恐怕又要跑反了。
    〔刘德馨〕即化铁，胡风集团分子。　〔柏寒〕即方然。　〔他的故乡〕指安庆。
      按：从以上两封信里可以看到胡风骨干分子绿原的真面目，胡风集团就是由这  样一批人组成的。绿原在一九四四年五月“被调至”“中美合作所”去“工作”。“中美合作所”就是“中美特种技术合作
  所”的简称，这是美帝国主义和蒋介石国民党合办的由美国人替美国自己也替蒋介石训练和派遣特务并直接进行恐怖活动的阴森黑暗的特务机关，以残酷拷打和屠杀共产党员和进步分子而著名的。谁能够把绿原“调至”这个特务机关去呢？特务机关能够“调”谁去“工作”呢？这是不言而喻的了。在后一封信里，在一九四七年九月，绿原还在骂中国共产党和人民革命的力量是“万恶的共匪”，可是，一九四八年初他就由另一胡风骨干分子曾卓介绍为共产党党员，打入了地下党的组织。后来绿原突然潜逃。武汉解放时又突然回到武汉，与曾卓一起自称是“共产党”，接收“大刚报”。一九五○年再度钻进党来（参看本材料第二十八条）。胡风反革命集团的分子就是这样来“追随革命”和钻进共产党里面来的。
    七、一九四×年×月二十一日庄涌给胡风信（自重庆）
    ……听说你办的杂志要在正中书局出。其实也好吧！
    〔庄涌〕地主反革命分子。当一九四六年解放军一度撤出他的本乡
         江苏省邳县时，他私设公堂拷打农民，实行倒算，逼死农民多人。
　〔正中书局〕国民党CC分子所办的书店。
    八、一九四七年九月十五日路翎给胡风信（自南京）
    桐城陷落，不知管兄如何？但大约没有能够出来，这真是颇狼狈的事情。
    〔桐城陷落〕指人民解放军一度解放安徽省的桐城县，胡风分子
         对此感到恐慌。同年十月十一日路翎给胡风信，探问“桐城究竟
        收复了没有”。　〔管兄〕即舒芜，当时是胡风集团分子。
    九、一九四七年九月十日方然给胡风信（自安庆）
    这两天，这个小城纷乱至极，匪军行将迫近。我们是束手于混乱之中的，听天由命。
    〔匪军〕见后信注。
    十、一九四七年九月二十六日方然给胡风信（自安庆）
    近日此间，因国军频频收复，人心已定。……管兄那里已成拉锯，不知其下落如何？先生处有讯否？念甚。
    〔匪军〕〔国军〕胡风分子在密信中诬蔑中国人民解放军为“匪
          军”，称呼国民党反动派的军队为“国军”，把解放了的地方暂
          时被国民党反动派军队侵占叫作“收复”，并且说“人心已定”
           ，在这里完全暴露出来了他们的本来面目。
    十一、一九四九年元月三十一日路翎给绿原信（自南京）
    寄来大江副刊均见到。一般的都是模糊的情形，夹缠不清的议论。但新的风暴起来，人们的心情已不暇顾及这些了。我们当希望能迎接苦难，而做到坚实的，更好的工作。
    〔大江副刊〕汉口“大刚报”副刊。　〔新的风暴〕指南京即将
           解放；当时全国人民兴奋鼓舞，而胡风分子却准备“迎接苦难”
           。　〔坚实的更好的工作〕即荫蔽和伪装得更好的反革命工作。
    二、胡风集团在全国解放后不断地秘密商议、制定反革命的策略和计划，向党和人民猖狂进攻
    十二、一九五○年三月二十一日芦甸给胡风信（自天津）
    第二篇批评文章出来后，当时我简直给弄呆了：亦门犯了一个冤枉的错误，但，这是一个严重的错误！由于这样，就使得很多人对你们过去的理论也发生怀疑了，这是非常糟糕的事！所以我主张他去找周扬一趟，说明发生这个错误的原因，说明事情是他个人的，我认为这不是理论上投降，这倒是一个气节问题。因为无论如何不能牵连到你，和别的朋友们……。
    〔第二篇批评文章〕指一九五○年三月“人民日报”上史笃同志
          对于阿垅的“论正面人物与反面人物”一文的批评。阿垅在他那
         篇文章里，歪曲和伪造马克思的著作，把特务文学作为“范例”
        和“方向”来向读者推荐。史笃同志指出了阿垅的这一罪恶勾当，
        使阿垅和胡风集团的人们大为狼狈。〔这不是理论上投降，这倒是
        一个气节问题〕这两句话是打进党内的胡风集团分子芦甸反党的铁
       证。他在这里直率地说出，在他看来，向党检讨自己的错误是“投
       降”，而矢忠于胡风是“气节”。因为阿垅和胡风是胡风集团中以
     “文艺理论家”的面目出现的，所以，芦甸痛心地说：“很多人对你
       们过去的理论也发生怀疑了，这是非常糟糕的事！”
    十三、一九五○年六月二十一日吕荧给胡风信自青岛）
    关于守梅兄的文字，都看到了，我觉得守梅兄该写一篇“歪曲和伪造不是批评”来答复的。（自然，引文是错了）
    〔守梅兄的文字〕守梅即阿垅，“文字”指阿垅写给“人民日报
        ”的一封信。一九五○年三月“人民日报”发表陈涌，史笃同志
       批评他的文章后，阿垅写一封信承认他歪曲地引用马克思著作的
       译文的错误。胡风集团分子吕荧在这封信里向胡风献策，认为“
       歪曲和伪造”的不是阿垅而是党报。吕荧鼓动阿垅向党报反攻，
       并且连文章的题目都代拟好了。在最近中国文联主席团和中国作
       家协会主席团召开的有七百多人到    会的联席扩大会议讨论开
       除胡风的会籍和撤销他的一切职务的时候，站起来替胡风辩护的
      就是这个吕荧。
    十四、一九五×年六月二十六日张中晓给梅志（胡风妻）信（自绍兴）
    问你：这位雪苇是代表官方的呢？还是接近官方呢？还是熟悉官方的呢？
    梅林说希望我和方典、耿庸两位通讯，不知你可否给我介绍他们底一点什么否？譬如说：他们在干什么事。记得“希望”一卷三期有一篇“你们以为那熏鱼的味道怎样”，不知道是不是这位耿庸？
    〔官方〕指党的领导。　〔方典〕即王元化。张中晓在这封信里
         询问几个人的情形，目的是在建立他们集团分子之间的联系。　
       〔雪苇、梅林、耿庸〕均胡风集团分子。
    十五、一九五×年七月三十一日阿垅给罗洛信（自天津）
    你，如果能够到雪苇那里，极好。这个人，虽然我接触得不多，在延安曾经接近过，是一个强有力的、严肃的人物，到他那里，工作和别的，都有更大的益处的。看样子，飞兄，元化，调到那里，大概是要做一些事情，而且还是决心和魄力的表现的。
    〔飞兄、元化〕即罗飞、王元化。阿垅在这封信里竭力赞美刘雪
         苇，说明他和刘雪苇早在一九三八年在延安的时候就有了关系。
          阿垅认为罗洛、罗飞、王元化等能调到刘雪苇所主持的上海新
         文艺出版社去工作，是大有可为的。事实果真是这样，胡风集团
         霸占了这个出版社后，就以此为据点进行了许多反革命的活动。
    十六、一九五一年八月十六日阿垅给胡风信（自天津）
    现在是得帮助雪苇，把上海打一个基础，埋头工作，在群众中做好工作，这样开始；所以，不能轻易地，似乎有了发表机会，就随感地写，在阵地未强固前就放起枪来。特别不能使雪因之受到不能工作之苦，这个结果是不好的。
    〔雪〕即刘雪苇。
    十七、一九五×年八月三十日阿垅给罗洛信（自天津）
    所以，要帮助雪苇。主要是：准备条件，多一些条件，再多一些条件！……是这样才能真正帮助雪苇，是这样才有利益于新时代底胚芽。
    十八、一九五一年八月二十四日阿垅给梅志信（自天津）
    我只是想到，最好埋头工作，把群众基础弄好。如果要批评，那就找大的对象，而且得把论点组织和考虑得更严密些；小东西和小事情最好不理。我想，上海朋友多，商量了做，总好些。
    我想雪苇在，搞好基础，有了条件的。先做这个。
    〔朋友〕指胡风集团的党羽。
    按：由阿垅这些信里可以看出，胡风分子是很懂得一些反革命的地下工作的策略的。他说：不要“在阵地未强固前就放起枪来”。而“主要是准备条件，多一些条件，再多一些条件！”要“埋头工作，在群众中做好工作”，把“群众基础弄好”，然后“就找大的对象”，即对准革命的要害加以攻击。在进攻时，要多同“朋友”“商量了做”，把“论点组织和考虑得更严密些，小东西和小事情最好不理。”反革命分子不是那样笨拙的，他们的这些策略，是很狡滑很毒辣的。一切革命党人决不能轻视他们，必须大大提高人民的政治警惕性，才能对付和肃清他们。
    十九、一九五二年二月三日绿原给胡风信（自武汉）
    斗争是要精力的，要讲究策略的。在原则以外的一些枝节都应该放在策略范围以内来考虑。我们所处的环境要求我们更严肃、更冷静。
    你知道，由于长久的“敬神”，多少年青可为的力量逐渐从惶惶然而沦于麻痹，也就是你所说的
  “发霉”。但，这个现象不正能增加我们的责任感么？同时也不正提高了我们的斗争的警惕么？
    〔敬神〕这是胡风分子对于广大人民群众拥护党、拥护党的领导
         的污蔑的说法。
    二十、一九五二年三月十一日路翎给胡风信（自北京）
    柏山接那摊子，实在是很难的。甸兄说：现在不接这些玩意最好！不过我以为，他也可以和那里面的那些现象打一仗，揭露出更多的蝗虫来的。积极的建设，现在是不可能的，那么，就希望他不致于被那黑压压的一大片拖得不能动弹。
    〔柏山〕即在上海的胡风分子彭柏山。　〔接那摊子〕指彭柏山
          获得了前华东军政委员会文化部副部长的位置，北京胡风分子们
          把这看成是胡风反动集团的一件大事，对此十分注意。　〔甸兄
           〕指天津胡风分子芦甸。　〔那些现象〕〔蝗虫〕〔黑压压的一
          大片〕这些都是胡风分子咒骂革命的文化工作和文化工作者的说法。
   　〔积极的建设〕指胡风集团的反革命事业。
    二十一、一九五×年五月三日阿垅给胡风信（自天津）
    鲁兄今日谈，要怎样才能扫清市侩们。而且想写一诗，暗含刺何老爷之意，那么，他会积极起来的。
    我今天又到师范学院去。据反映，激起来了对文学的兴趣。今天，除文史系的人，门口都摆了小凳子，坐了四五个人。芦兄也到南开中学讲了两次，效果极好。……打算继续和扩大。
    〔鲁兄〕指胡风分子鲁藜。　〔市侩们〕对党和非党的文艺工作
        者们的污蔑的说法。　〔何老爷〕指何其芳同志。　〔师范学院
          〕即天津师范学院。　〔芦兄〕指芦甸。阿垅和芦甸在天津大肆
        活动，到处演讲，以散布和扩大他们的影响。
    二十二、一九五二年五月七日芦甸给胡风信（自天津）
    和宁、徐、严诸兄在一块谈了一下，希望你早点写信给周，表示要来北京，要工作；他迟不回信，又写信催；他再不回信，就来京找他。……其次要采取进攻的战略方针，即不等他们提出你的问题，你先到上面提出你对目前的文艺运动的意见，给他们来一个闷棍吃吃。
    〔宁、徐、严诸兄〕指胡风分子路翎、徐放、严望。当时胡风还
        在上海，在北京的一些胡风分子们集议，让胡风到北京来，以便
        统率他的党羽们向党进攻，并为他谋划向党进攻的战略和策略。
　  〔周〕指周恩来同志。　〔不等他们提出你的问题……〕“他们
       ”指党的领导文艺工作的同志。　〔上面〕指中共中央。
      按：芦甸这种以攻为守的策略，后来胡风果然实行了，这就是胡风到北京来请求派工作，请求讨论他的问题，三十万字的上书言事，最后是抓住“文艺报”问题放大炮。各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。或者无中生有，当面造谣；或者抓住若干表面现象，攻击事情的本质；或者吹捧一部分人，攻击一部分人；或者借题发挥，“打开一个缺口”，使我们处于困难地位。总之，他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，“窥测方向”，以求一逞。有时他们会“装死躺下”，等待时机，“反攻过去”。他们有长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会做各种形式的斗争——合法的斗争和非法的斗争。我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便将他们战而胜之。切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。
    二十三、一九五二年五月十八日绿原给胡风信     （自武汉）
    梅兄前不久路过武汉，回天津去了。他的须发都已斑白，心情也很不开朗。回去，恰又遇上整风。以他的诚恳，我想不会发生什么意外的。但，和这些老爷们纠缠，也得深入到他们的肝脏里面去，不然会碰上一些意想不到的打击的。我因此担心他会以对我们自己的忠诚来处理这些无聊的关系，结果招致一些麻烦。这自然是我的过虑，但斗争的确不容丝毫疏忽啊。
    宁兄近况如何？我想他是懂得怎样斗争的，但也很怀念。
    〔梅兄〕即阿垅。　〔整风〕指文艺整风。〔宁兄〕即路翎。在
       这封信里，绿原认为阿垅对付文艺界整风要有策略，要耍两面派
      态度，以便“深入到他们的肝脏里面去”。
      按：由于我们革命党人骄傲自满，麻痹大意，或者顾了业务，忘记政治，以致许多反革命分子“深入到”我们的“肝脏里面”来了。这决不只是胡风分子，还有更多的其他特务分子或坏分子钻进来了。
    二十四、一九五四年五月五日方然给胡风信     （自杭州）
    望加一把劲，早日搞完。但我以为，同样重要的，是此时的态度问题。总之，一定要是积极的、无“距离”的态度：?送上理论，同时送上入党申请书；?应参加的文艺活动与社会活动都是积极的参加，例如，奉邀出席什么座谈会之类，不推托，不沉默；?不对任何人发什么牢骚，等等。此中道理，毋庸多言。
    〔送上理论〕“理论”指胡风向中共中央写的那个三十万字的向
        党大举进攻的“意见书”。方然在这封信里向胡风献计如何在向
        党进攻的时候采取巧妙的两面派的态度欺骗党，甚至要他向党递
       “入党申请书”。
      按：胡风集团分子和其他许多暗藏的反革命分子，大都采取方然在这封信里所讲的两面派策略，特别是他的?、?两条策略，很可以欺骗许多人。但他们总有漏洞可以给人们找到，胡风集团的被揭露，就是一个证据。特别是在大多数人的觉悟程度和警惕性提高了以后，他们的两面派策略就更易被揭露了。
    二十五、一九五四年八月二十九日欧阳庄给胡风信（自南京）
    有一个想法，建议你再写几篇新人物，以明心迹坦荡……
    〔新人物〕欧阳庄向胡风献计，再写几篇记述英雄人物的特写
          ，作为拥护新社会的幌子。从这里充分可以看出，胡风和胡风
         分子把他们对新社会的虚伪的歌颂当作掩蔽他们的反革命活动
        的手段。
    二十六、一九五四年十一月十五日阿垅给胡风信（自天津）
    运动是长期的，将有一年到两年。各方面地清算以胡适为首的资产阶级学术思想。
    在文艺方面也如此开始。
    因此我感到，关于“日程”，首先得求得一个理解，然后进行才行。两个要点：既不能和总的步骤矛盾；也不能被烟雾蒙蔽而耽误问题的提出。这里存在着矛盾和困难。
    如果和总的步骤有矛盾，将给以仅仅的个人问题的印象。人们当然不能说不对。不过会使事业受到别的阻碍的。
    如果被蒙蔽于烟幕，而耽误问题及时的提出，也会有同一结果，使事业受到阻碍。
    要了解研究情况。
    要善于符合总的步骤而定我们的步骤。
    刘兄来或许有帮助。
    〔“日程”〕指胡风集团在文化界批判胡适期间的活动计划。在
        这个反对资产阶级唯心主义思想的斗争面前，胡风集团的反革命
        活动遇到了困难。他们憎恨这个斗争，把这个斗争说成是“烟雾
         ”、“烟幕”，但是，他们又不敢公开地反对这个斗争。因此，
        阿垅为胡风献计：“要了解研究情况”、“要善于符合总的步骤
    而定我们的步骤”，意思是，要在表面上顺着这个斗争形势乘机
        向党进攻。〔刘兄〕指芦甸。这时芦甸来到北京，帮助胡风策划
        他们的反革命活动。
      按：从这里也可以看到我们批判胡适派资产阶级唯心论这一斗争的重要性和必要性。有些人口称相信马克思列宁主义，却不重视批判唯心论这一斗争，或者说自己没有唯心论，或者说自己和胡适无关系，因而最好避开不谈。但胡风集团却是重视的，他们在研究如何对付的方法。“这里存在着矛盾和困难”。批判唯心论果然给了胡风集团以“矛盾和困难”，这就可见批判的对了。革命队伍里的人，难道也有“矛盾和困难”吗？
    二十七、一九五五年二月十四日张中晓给冀汸信（自上海）
    大概已进入摊牌阶段了。
    现在必须这样做的：第一，朋友们各人的问题是自己的问题，一切要从自己的劳动去看；不能和古公的问题混为一谈，这是前提。第二，在这个前提下，被迫讲话时可对古公批判；第三，在这个前提下，可以检查自己工作中的缺点。
    一切不能离开这个前提。
    便时希告朱兄，来不及同他写信了。
    〔摊牌阶段〕指对胡风思想的批判已经展开、胡风在一九五五年
        一月二十日给张中晓的信中，指示了应付这次批判的方针，即“
       至于和我有友谊的同志们，那和我是两回事，应该是就各人底劳
       动去看的”，就是说，要他们各自设法蒙混过关。张中晓在这封
      信里向胡风分子们传达胡风的指示。　〔朋友们〕指胡风集团的党
      羽们。　〔古公〕指胡风。　〔朱兄〕指方然，即朱声。三、胡风
      分子千方百计打入共产党内，取得党员称号，以便窃取党内文件，
     探听党内情况，报告胡风，向胡风表示无限忠诚，对党采取欺骗手
    段 ，里应外合地从事各种反革命活动
    二十八、一九五○年七月二十三日绿原给胡风信（自汉口）
    今年三月，我的候补期就满了，但迟到今天仍未彻底解决。我曾用最大诚恳写过三次报告，一次比一次详尽而老实。除了检讨“文艺思想”很难令人满意外，其余大体合格。这个过程对于我们实在是一场斗争。
    〔候补期〕指共产党新党员的候补期。
  按：一大批胡风分子打入党内取得党员称号这一件事，应当引起一切党组织注意。绿原解放前曾经一度钻进我们的地下党组织，后因潜逃失去党籍。在一九五○年，这个反革命分子又对我们的党组织“用最大诚恳写过三次报告，一次比一次详尽而老实”，除了文艺思想而外，“其余大体合格”，果然后来又被接受为“党员”了。这样的事，难道还不应当引起一切党组织的注意吗？这些反革命分子是在用尽心思欺骗了我们之后爬进党内来的，他们把这当作“一场斗争”看待，他们斗胜了我们，他们进来了！
   二十九、一九五一年六月二十四日欧阳庄给胡风信（自南京）
    苏州有一个同志可谈（在市委工作，党员），此人在解放初期受了打击（“自由主义”），可能斗志较差，但可一试。
    〔苏州一个同志〕欧阳庄向胡风报告他发现了在苏州有一个可以
        “联络”的人。他们发现犯了错误的共产党员，就认为是“可谈
         ”的，也就是可“争取”的对象。
      按：共产党员的自由主义倾向受到了批判，胡风分子就叫做“ 受了打击”。如果这人“斗志较差”，即并不坚持自由主义立场，而愿意接受党的批判转到正确立场上来的话，对于胡风集团来说，那就无望了，他们就拉不走这个人。如果这人坚持自由主义立场的“斗志”不是“较差”而是“较好”的话，那末，这人就有被拉走的危险。胡风分子是要来“试”一下的，他们已经称这人为“同志”了。这种情况，难道还不应当引为教训吗？一切犯有思想上和政治上错误的共产党员，在他们受到批评的时候，应当采取什么态度呢？这里有两条可供选择的道路：一条是改正错误，做一个好的党员；一条是堕落下去，甚至跌入反革命坑内。这后一条路是确实存在的，反革命分子可能正在那里招手呢！
     三十、一九五二年一月三十日路翎给胡风信（自北京）
    关于芦兄的那消息，只是一般的简讯之类吧。我未见到，大约是，某些同志例如谁谁等袒护了错误的思想。芦兄回天津过年去了，待他回来当找他谈谈。他的讨论会，结果还不太恶劣，领导者转了点弯，他也含蓄了些，滑过去了，看来不致于再有什么。
    〔关于芦兄的那消息〕“芦兄”指芦甸，打入党内的胡风分子。
        一月二十日路翎致胡风的另一信中，曾提到党刊“建设”中“
       有关于他（芦甸）‘袒护’梅兄（阿垅）的那一套说法发表出
       来了，想是内部汇报中传上去的”云云。这里所说的“消息”
          、“简讯”，指此。打入党内的胡风分子曾把党刊“建设”
        偷给胡风、路翎看。〔他的讨论会〕指党内讨论芦甸文艺思想
       的会议。一月二十日路翎致胡风信报告“芦甸重新遭‘整’”，
       亦指此。　〔含蓄了些〕〔滑过去了〕均指芦甸的欺骗手段。
      按：从这一类的信里，应当引起我们的警觉，不要让他们“滑过去了”。
    三十一、一九五二年四月四日芦甸给胡风信（自天津）
    铅印的东西我在北京就听说，苦无法看到。有机会回京时，到晦君处看看是否有。
    〔铅印的东西〕指某一党内材料。胡风在同年三月二十七日给路
         翎的信中，曾要路翎转令严望、徐放、芦甸偷窃这一个材料。从
         这一封和以下一些信里，可以看到芦甸怎样遵从胡风的命令，千
         方百计地来偷窃这个材料。　〔晦君〕指阿英同志。
    三十二、一九五二年四月七日芦甸给胡风信（自天津）
    从鲁兄处见到陈对艾等言论所作的报告，从这，可以看出，在一般理论工作上的教条主义，领导上已充份地感觉到了，所批评的人物，都是现时所谓突出的人物的。……陈的报告打一份给你看，去京时，另给一份翎兄，……。
    〔鲁兄〕指鲁藜，混进了共产党的胡风分子。〔陈对艾等言论所作的
        报告〕指一件党内材料。胡风曾指使打进党内的胡风分子芦甸将这个
        材料偷给胡风集团。〔翎兄〕指路翎。
    三十三、一九五二年四月十八日芦甸给胡风信        （自天津）
    前信及附寄的陈文不知收到否？……梅兄从湖南来信，他要到六月底才可回津，也好，天津五月一日即开始进行文艺整风，梅兄即可避免一些无谓的纠缠。近来未接宁兄来信，不知他的近况怎样？……我已把陈文用信寄给宁兄了。
    〔陈文〕即前信所指一件党内材料。芦甸把这个材料偷给胡风和路
        翎。　〔梅兄〕指阿垅。　〔宁兄〕指路翎。
      按：从这类信里可以看出，暗藏在革命队伍里的反革命分子很怕整风，可见整风是有益的。怕整风的人不都是反革命分子，绝对大多数（百分之九十几）是思想上或政治上犯有某些错误的人，对他们的方针是帮助他们改正错误。但反革命分子很怕整风，对他们的方针则是进一步挖出他们的反革命根子。胡风反革命集团的面目，是在解放前和解放后的几次整风，即过去的几次思想斗争中逐步地暴露出来的。由于那几次整风，才产生了胡风集团内部的分化，才迫使胡风集团采取以攻为守的策略——三十万字的上书言事，才有最后的大揭露。
    三十四、一九五二年五月七日芦甸给胡风信（自天津）
    从晦君处见到了铅印的东西，我已拿给宁兄看过，详情他会写信告诉你。
    〔铅印的东西〕即第三十一信所指一件党内材料。
    〔宁兄〕指路翎。
    三十五、一九五二年六月九日芦甸给胡风信（自天津）
    不必为那个卑劣的灵魂伤脑筋，考虑今后的做法要紧。“按”是一个暗杀政策，因为无力打阵地战。这是他们的得意杰作。我以为，应当再向上面表示态度，要求公开讨论，要求面谈，如果上面也肯定那个判决词，那，就是“历史”问题了。过去吃亏在不摸底，对于一切情况的估计不够，做法还是太善良了。……说老实话，我因为太气愤，说得语无伦次，望你慎重考虑一下。
    〔那个卑劣的灵魂〕指检讨后的舒芜。芦甸的这封信是在“人民
        日报”上发表了舒芜的检讨文章的第二天写出的。　〔“按”〕
        指一九五二年六月八日“人民日报”在登载舒芜检讨文章时加的
       编者按语。芦甸竟咒骂党中央机关报的按语是“暗杀政策”等等。 　〔上面〕指中共中央。
      按：从这类信里可以看出，在强大的人民革命力量即人民民主专政面前，只要这个专政提高了群众的觉悟，采取了正确的政策，那就不管有多少暗藏的反革命集团，也不管每个反革命集团的内部纪律如何森严，攻守同盟如何坚固，总有一些人可以分化出来的，而这种分化是于人民有利的。舒芜从胡风集团分化出来一事使得胡风集团大伤脑筋，就是一证。近日各地许多胡风分子们纷纷坦白，自动地或被迫地交出密件，揭露内情，是这个斗争的继续发展。
    三十六、一九五二年六月二十九日芦甸给胡风信（自天津）
    六月二十六日来信收到了。很高兴，居然有了敢于“挺身而出”的人们！但在做法上，我建议不要联名，因为这样容易被加上罪名，即组织“小集团”的罪名，……因此，最好是各人写各人的，各人对自己所提的问题负责，这样就不会互相牵扯，陷于被动。
    〔建议不要联名〕为反对党对文艺工作的领导，胡风曾指示他的
        党羽组织一批人联名写信给中共中央，控告文艺工作方面党的负
        责人。芦甸在这里向胡风“建议不要联名”，以免暴露胡风集团
        的面目。
    三十七、一九五二年十月二十日绿原给胡风信（自武汉）
    早晨发一信，接着收到你的信。是鞭子，叫我痛，更叫我清醒。
    至今为止，没有写什么。已写一篇，只谈了自己，不合要求，放下了。
    首先，怪我无知，没有经验以及意志薄弱。但没有什么，而且正在和自己作斗争。请相信我的一点忠贞，没有吴止的动机；但看法和做法都几乎坏事，也感到羞耻。
    吴止第一次文发表后，这里就开始了对我的关怀。从三反批判起，原说只在内部检讨；但到信和日报号召发表后，就说要写文参加了。一直拖，拖不下去，写了一篇，没有通过。大意是：过去就是那样的过去，有限制，有弱点（自己的）；要紧是现在，而现在是有领导的。全文是从自己谈到自己为止。现在是僵住，说等负责同志自京回后再说。大体过程如此。
    〔收到你的信……〕舒芜发表“致路翎的公开信”后，曾写信问
         绿原的意见。绿原在给舒芜的回信中对胡风的反动“文艺理论”
         辩护得不够坚决。路翎看到了这封信，告诉胡风，胡风写信严厉
         地责备绿原，并且要求他“即回信说得清楚一些”。绿原立即写
         这信向胡风表示“忠贞”，并且说明他是怎样欺骗党，怎样掩护
         胡风集团的。　〔已写一篇〕指绿原写的假检讨。　〔吴止〕有
         时写作“无耻”，均指检讨错误以后的舒芜。　〔吴止第一次文
         〕指舒芜的“从头学习‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’”一文、
       〔信和日报号召〕“信”指舒芜的“致路翎的公开信”；“日报
    号召”指人民日报转载舒芜检讨错误的文章时的编者按语。
    三十八、一九五四年八月三十一日方然给胡风信（自杭州）
    我写个东西问题，洛兄也未带来意见商量。如专写草全事，那很简单；如多写，则怎样写方可避免雷同与“一齐攻上去”的看法？提那些意见？尚要商量一下才动手。洛兄意不多写，专写草全；我意应多写，而抓住两个重点。待考虑成熟后，九月份内努力写成，寄先生先阅。
    〔写个东西问题〕胡风指使他的党羽们分别写信给党中央“控告
         ”文艺界党的负责同志。方然、罗洛（信内称“洛兄”）当时都
         是候补党员（后因品质恶劣先后被取消候补党员资格），在胡风
        指使下从党内进行这一阴谋活动。〔草全〕指邵荃麟同志。方然
       打算在给中共中央的信中攻击邵荃麟同志。
    三十九、一九五四年十月十一日方然给胡风信（自杭州）
    给陆的信已写好，同忠兄研究了一番，有些踌躇：①信的内容专谈一个问题，即“完全是为胡某辩解”，且火气太大；②突然，形似串通。忠兄之意，缓发，……但我意，不管这些了，日内即抄发。
    〔陆〕指陆定一同志。方然所写的“控告”信后来果然寄给陆定
         一同志。　〔忠兄〕胡风分子冀汸。
    〔为胡某辩解〕即为胡风辩解。　〔形似串通〕这句话和前信中
         说的“怎样写方可避免雷同与‘一齐攻上去’的看法”，是他们
         怕被党发现他们的进攻是有组织、有计划的。
    四十、一九五五年一月二十八日欧阳庄给胡风信（自南京）
    寄去笔记一份，请参考。此系默涵在高教部党组的传达。
    〔笔记〕指一党内指示，由林默涵同志在一九五四年十二月十一日
        向高等教育部党组作传达。欧阳庄窃得这一传达的笔记后，寄给胡
        风。在这封信里附有稿笺九纸，是复写的传达笔记全份。
      按：从这类信里可以看出，我们的机关、部队、企业或团体里是有人偷窃机密的。这种人就是混入这些机关、部队、企业或团体内的反革命分子，有些自由主义分子则是这些反革命分子的好朋友。这种情况，难道还不应该引起全体工作人员和全体人民的严重注意吗？
     四、胡风集团从他们的反革命立场和反动“理论”出发，诋毁党的文艺方针、文化政策，仇视党所发动的对于资产阶级思想的批判和关于马克思列宁主义的宣传
    四十一、一九五一年八月二十二日张中晓给胡风信（自绍兴）
    为了想写一写，看了一遍毛著“论文艺问题”，但，看了之后，就不想写了，现在告诉你一些我对这本书的意见：
    作家与对象在创作过程进行搏斗，在我觉得这是真假现实主义的分歧点，但，他只说：“观察，体验，研究，分析”，多冷静！
    “功利主义”云云。这个标准压杀了真正的批评，压杀了新的东西。对于“暴露”，“歌颂”的三小段，是不对的，这完全是形式的理解和机械的看法。我讨厌“暴露”，“歌颂”（这含义应该与“暴露”相对）这类说法，我觉得，应该换写为痛苦，欢乐，追求和梦想，我觉得，现实主义应该驱逐这些庸俗的恶劣的说法。
    关于鲁迅杂文的一段，是完全不对的。杂文，是从现实人生要求中随处发掘出一切新思想的锋利的锄头，假如仅仅把他看作“处在黑暗势力统治之下，没有言论自由，故以冷嘲热讽的杂文形式作战”才“正确”，那就根本没有懂得鲁迅。
    其他当然还有好几点。以上的一些，我觉得特别重要，而且深刻的感觉得它是不对的。总观全书，其本质是非现实主义！……
    这书，也许在延安时有用，但，现在，我觉得是不行了。照现在的行情，它能屠杀生灵，怪不得帮闲们奉之若图腾！
    譬如“观察，体验，研究，分析……”乔木就引用过。
    当然，里面有一些是对的，譬如“不是在作品中写哲学讲义”，以及你在“论现实主义的路”第十页所引的一些。但，我觉得这些都该是马列主义的常识。
    我真不敢想那些以为这本书是“最完整”的文艺方针而且谆谆教训别人的指导家们心中作何想头！
    〔毛著“论文艺问题”〕指毛泽东同志“在延安文艺
    座谈会上的讲话”。胡风分子张中晓在这封信里对毛泽东同志的这个伟大著作中的许多内容一一加以诋毁，并污蔑这本书为“非现实主义”的和“屠杀生灵”的。　〔帮闲们〕这是胡风分子对革命干部和革命文艺工作者的污蔑的说法。　〔图腾〕原始社会的人把一种动物或其他自然物当作神圣来崇拜，这种被崇拜的东西叫作“图腾”。〔乔木〕指乔冠华同志，他在一九四八年用“乔木”这一笔名写了一篇题名为
  “文艺创作与主观”的文章，批评了胡风的文艺思想。
    按：从这封信里可以看见，胡风集团坚决反对共产党所确定的文艺方向，极端仇恨毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”。因为党和毛泽东同志号召文艺工作者要歌颂工农兵，要暴露工农兵的敌人，而胡风集团恰是工农兵的死敌，他们觉得暴露工农兵的敌人就会使他们混不下去，就会“屠杀”他们这伙反革命的所谓“生灵”，就会“压杀了”他们这伙反革命的所谓“新的东西”。但是他们不敢公开地反对这个讲话，而且胡风还教唆他的党羽在表面上要“顺着它”，有时并引用其中的一些字句。这些，都是胡风分子伪装自己的假面具。而在这封密信里，就完全暴露了胡风分子仇恨这个讲话和反党的真面目。张中晓说：“这书（指毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话），也许在延安时有用，但，现在，我觉得是不行了”。“现在不行了”，在文艺界里面不是还有一些人也这样说过么？说过这种话的人，请注意读读张中晓这封信吧！当然，有些说这样话的人，他们还只是抱着资产阶级的文艺观点，所以不能认识这个讲话的重要性。但是，张中晓这个胡风分子，凭着他的反革命的敏感，却深深地了解这个讲话在全国解放以后会在更广大的范围内掌握群众，并对各种反动的文艺思想起摧毁性的作用，所以他们就急于想阻止和破坏这个讲话的影响的扩大。他们所谓“现在……不行了”，道理就在这里。
    四十二、一九五一年二月十四日张中晓给胡风信（自绍兴）
    对于目前情形，我个人发现了一个极严重的现象，就是现在的舆论都有着“复古”的倾向。至少，有意无意和旧东西妥协，变相的鼓吹着“东方精神文明”，教授们都竭力在“表扬我国历史的文化和文明”，但他们却忘记了要变成木乃伊。
    当然，这些将像泡沫一样的消失在人民底大流里的罢。但在目前，却是一个严重的事实，在抽象的工农兵和庸俗的爱国主义的包庇下，多少的有生力量受到了摧残？……
    至于表现在宣传上，那当然更其恶劣，……把屠户的凶残化为一笑！
    〔“复古”的倾向〕胡风分子仇视祖国文化遗产，仇视人民群众
        的爱国主义，所以污蔑我们的舆论有“‘复古’的倾向”，“变
        相的鼓吹着‘东方精神文明’”。　〔木乃伊〕古代埃及人用香
        料殓死人尸体，使它久不腐烂，这种尸体叫“木乃伊”。胡风分
       子在这里咒骂进行爱国主义教育的人们要变成死尸。
    四十三、一九五一年七月十七日张中晓给梅志信（自绍兴）
      “文学界”看到了，有一位叫做萧岱的，仿佛要我“从实际出发”。
    我忘记了不知在什么地方看到过，这位姓萧的本来原和梅林、元化等参与“青年文学”的编辑的，是友是敌，还不能确定。不过对你，我就随便的谈谈：我觉得“武训传”问题，假如想有所得，决不能高谈什么改良、投降主义之类，而应该集中对孙瑜。但这位姓萧的说我底这一主张会削弱论争，好像必须从“理论”（？？）上去批判武训，才算丰富或开展论争。但其实，武训能起什么作用呢？我们现在的一些什么们，不是比武训更奴性十足么？姓萧的所谓“展开”（？）只不过双眼向天，两脚悬空的壮言大语而已，假如我们真的依照他所主张的
  “实际”去出发，恐怕除了糟塌些纸墨之外，其他是一无用处的。
  这种不顾战略要求的文章，我想一定是敌人。
    王元化是不是可以信任的？可不可以纵情的谈些什么？读他底来信是热情的，但似乎有点做作，当然，一封信是并不能判定一个人的，不过，为了避免不必要的纠纷，当然应该小心。
    〔“文学界”〕上海“文汇报”的副刊。　〔萧岱〕一位上海的
        文艺工作者。胡风分子张中晓在这封信里诋毁党所发动的具有重
        大意义的“武训传”批判运动，并向胡风请示谁是他们的“友人
       ”，谁是他们的“敌人”。　〔元化〕即王元化，当时在上海新
       文艺出版社工作。
    四十四、一九五二年六月十六日阿垅给梅志信（自天津）
    近来比较忙。多了一些事务，参加了一些座谈会，例如武训座谈会。有时有些好笑，那些老爷，一个钟头以前唱赞美诗，一个钟头才过去又翻脸六亲不认，以至连自己底澡都得用旁人以无辜的忏悔来为他们洗。所以又笑不出来，太恶劣。洛兄寄了些材料来，看起来似乎上海是个混乱的中心。
    〔那些老爷〕这是胡风集团谩骂党和非党的革命干部的话。阿垅
        在这封信里利用曾有部分的革命干部错误地称赞过“武训传”这
        一情况来污蔑和反对党所发动的对于“武训传”的批判。　〔洛
       兄〕指罗洛，胡风集团分子。
    四十五、一九五○年十一月十五日张中晓给胡风信（自上海）
    ……但报纸上，期刊上，都是机械论，譬如“学习”。我也曾想到过，上月二十一日我去信“学习”，提出了问题……
    照我底想法，总该在整个思想领域上发动……不然，假如借机械论独占下去，即是有伟大的作品出世，人们也是没有力量感受的，现在似乎是旧趣味加机械论最吃香的时候！无论任一领域！
    〔“学习”〕即“学习”杂志。　〔在整个思想领域上发动〕即
        发动对整个革命思想领域的攻击。
    五、胡风集团分子异口同声地用种种恶毒的和下流的词句咒骂革命文艺界的党的领导，咒骂革命文艺工作者和他们的作品，咒骂党和革命文艺界对于他们的批评
    四十六、一九五一年十二月二十七日芦甸给绿原信（自天津）
    今天，在文艺这一领域，几乎没有一块干净的土地，执掌大旗或正在抢夺大旗的就很少不是市侩，由于这，也就规定了战斗的坚苦性和长期性。
      按：从这类信里可以看出，反革命分子的攻击少数人不过是他们的借口，他们的一种策略。他们的本意是“几乎没有一块干净的土地”。由于这种情况，他们“就规定了战斗的坚苦性和长期性”。自从汉朝的吴王刘濞发明了请诛鼂错（汉景帝的主要谋画人物）以清君侧的著名策略以来，不少的野心家奉为至宝，胡风集团也继承了这个衣钵。他们在三十万字上书中只攻击林默涵、何其芳、周扬同志等几个人，说这几个人弄坏了一切事。有些在阶级本能上同情胡风的人，也照着这样替胡风瞎吹，说什么“这不过是周扬和胡风争领导权的个人之间的斗争”。我们在肃清胡风分子和其他反革命分子的斗争中，这一点也是应当注意的。
    四十七、一九五○年四月五日绿原给胡风信（自武汉）
    前天看到梅兄的“启事”，非常痛苦。我原以为可以不必做声的，但看来其中或有若干劝戒和考虑的。梅兄太真诚，太坦白，不能承担这种威吓性的诬蔑；不过我觉得总该对那些原形们反刺一下才好。看了史某的“檄文”，我曾写了一篇短文，想寄去；但为了在此减少麻烦，同时也看到梅兄的
  “信”，就放下来了。形势变化了，斗争方法也应该变化；对象底本质虽然依旧，但衣装换季了。我们首先必先站稳，努力做到减少天真无“邪”的误解，不使扩大这个可能。……对于一些无知于过去的天真的“螳螂们”，是无所谓的；可鄙的是一些
  “放下屠刀立地成佛”的向上爬的蛆虫们！
    〔梅兄的启事〕〔梅兄的信〕“梅兄”即阿垅。“启事”和“信
       ”均指一九五○年三月他被批评后，写给“人民日报”承认错误
      的信。　〔原形们〕指党员作家和非党的进步作家。　〔史某的
     “檄文”〕指史笃同志一九五○年三月发表在“人民日报”上的批
      评阿垅的文章。　〔螳螂们〕指革命的青年文艺工作者。
      〔向上爬的蛆虫们〕指接受党的文艺方向，愿意改造自己的文
      艺工作者。
    四十八、一九五一年六月二十一日绿原给胡风信（自武汉）
    ……主要恐怕自己快变成“鲍鱼”了。一天到黑，考虑这，研究那，无非是那些“发展规律”。……
    我吃惊的是我仍然生活在沉重的亚细亚的麻木里，真是“取木乃伊的，变成了木乃伊”。麻木本身尚不足惧，足惧者乃是麻木传染了清醒的东西。本来是“大喝一声”的时代，但“大喝”只有“一声”，余下者只是嗡嗡不休，令人欲睡的回响。这些回响者们偏又以为自己也是“大喝”，必须无条件倾听。结果，麻木者麻木得更加心安理得，以致有了保障。这一点，你是完全了解的。
    〔“鲍鱼”〕我国过去有一句成语：“如入鲍鱼之肆，久而不闻
        其臭”。鲍鱼，就是腐臭的鱼。绿原在这里骂我们整个革命队伍
        是“鲍鱼”。
    四十九、一九五二年四月一日绿原给胡风信（自武汉）
    事件本身和我毫无牵连，但居然想这样扯上去。这种阴阳怪气只是前奏，当然干脆不理。一定要拉开，我也毫不畏惧的。虽然只学了几天马列主义，也足以应付这些老爷们了。
    〔事件本身……〕这时全国文艺界进行整风运动，绿原在“长江
        日报”社工作，报社要他检查思想，他在这封信里表现出来了他
        的反革命的敌对态度。　〔学了几天马列主义……〕这句话暴露
        出来了胡风集团分子有时胡乱地引用一些马克思列宁主义的词句，
        其目的正在反对党和反对马克思列宁主义。
    五十、一九四七年四月三日路翎给胡风信（自南京）
    你看见那老头子的樱桃树之类的王八蛋文章吧。汸兄直接给他写了一封信去，轰了一顿。但沉默也是同样“愉快”的。
    〔那老头子的樱桃树之类〕“老头子”指郭沫若同志。郭沫若同
        志这时在“文汇报”上发表了一篇批评胡风分子耿庸和曰木的文
        章，题目为“想起了斫樱桃树的故事”。先是耿庸写了一篇“略
        说不安”，曰木写了一篇“从文艺界恶劣风气想起”，其中攻击
        巴金、唐韬等同志，郭沫若同志文中引用十八世纪美国总统华盛
        顿幼年乱斫樱桃树的故事作比喻，批评胡风分子对进步作家乱加
        攻击。这种善意的批评竟遭到胡风分子路翎和冀汸的下流不堪的
        谩骂（冀汸信见后）。〔汸兄〕即冀汸。
    五十一、一九四七年六月二十四日冀汸给胡风信（自南京）
    今天在“文汇报”上读了郭沫若底“想起了斫樱桃树的故事”，真把人气哑了，他简直像文坛皇帝，在那里下诏令。……普天之下，古往今来，从没见像这样的律师和讼棍的！……真是混蛋，王八旦！我想直接寄一封信给他，把皇帝底尊严“冒犯”一下。实在使人愤怒。这些家伙们底面孔和心肠都照在哈哈镜里，古怪极了！
    〔“想起了斫樱桃树的故事”〕这是郭沫若同志批评耿庸和曰木
         的文章的题目，发表在“文汇报”上，详见前第五十封信注文。
    五十二、一九××年×月×日逯登泰给胡风信
    植芳兄离近，我时常接近他，从他我也被提高了，他的生活内容真复杂，有些地方我不相信他会做出那样的事情来，我们详细的分析过郭沫若先生，结论是“近百年中国文化的罪恶的产儿”。
    我看过李有才的板话，那是从教条中产生出来的宣传品，人物在实际的生活里也是依照教条来动的，……
    〔逯登泰〕胡风集团分子、特务，已判刑。　〔植芳兄〕即贾植
         芳。　〔李有才的板话〕指赵树理同志的小说“李有才板话”。
    五十三、一九四七年五月七日路翎给胡风信（自南京）
    剧本下星期一开始排……果然不错，万家宝君听说了，要约我本星期日“玩玩”。预备去“玩玩”，但对这样的伪君子，是不能说什么话的罢。我也总不会使他们“愉快”的。
    〔剧本〕路翎的反动剧本“云雀”，当时由胡风分子
    黄若海领导的剧团在南京上演，胡风曾著文吹捧，并
    亲到南京去“打气”。　〔万家宝〕即剧作家曹禺同
    志。路翎在另一封给胡风的信里辱骂曹禺同志，说：
    “万才子会见了，无聊透顶！”云云。
    五十四、一九五○年六月十五日路翎给胡风信（自北京）
    老舍的剧本昨天念了。很坏。我想这也是他底头痛问题之一。但当然，演是会演的。昨天听了这剧本的朗诵，我就颇有点幸灾乐祸地高兴，我想，可以给喜剧之说打一棍子了。
    〔老舍的剧本〕指“方珍珠”，中国青年艺术剧院曾
    上演。胡风分子路翎为该剧的部分缺点而幸灾乐祸。
    〔他〕指当时的中国青年艺术剧院院长廖承志同志。
      按：从这类信里可以看出，胡风集团在他们的三十万字上书和其他一切的公开言论中，好像他们主要只是反对共产党的作家而不反对其他的人。他们当然从来不反对蒋介石和国民党的其他人物，（只在有时小骂几句以作幌子，即所谓“小骂大帮忙”），但不反对其他的人则是假的。原来他们对鲁迅、闻一多、郭沫若、茅盾、巴金、黄药眠、曹禺、老舍这许多革命者和民主人士都是一概加以轻蔑、谩骂和反对的。这种不要自己集团以外的一切人的作风，不正是蒋介石法西斯国民党的作风吗？
    五十五、一九四六年五月十八日冀汸给胡风信（自南京）
    最近，我想弄一个诗刊出来。要作战，总得有阵地。东游西击，总是不会有战果的。而“陀式”诗和“方言诗”又这样狂妄，一如剧坛上只有妖魔鬼怪一样，乐坛上只有“古怪歌”和“牛头不对马嘴”一样。
    〔“陀式”诗和“方言诗”〕冀汸对解放前暴露国民党反动统治的
        诗歌、戏剧和群众歌曲肆意辱骂，从这里看得出胡风集团对解放前
        的反对国民党的文艺作品是充满敌意的。这里提到的“陀式”诗、
       “方言诗”，指当时马凡陀同志等所作的反对国民党的诗歌。“古
    怪歌”和“牛头不对马嘴”两首歌曲当时在国民党统治区很流行、
        内容暴露国民党的腐朽反动统治，痛斥国民党特务横行，迫害人民，
        进行反人民的内战。当时群众在举行集会游行的时候常常唱这些歌。
    五十六、一九四八年五月二十三日朱谷怀给胡风信
    昨天从朋友处借来了“人民与文艺”，略看了几篇，觉得那批混虫愈来愈疯狂了。

    ……有些东西，就其内容，就其倾向，就其影响，实令人难以容忍的，如“三千里江山”……等等，作为读者，是不能不讲话的。不能让僵尸与鬼影就这末安然无事，就这末得意扬扬地统治着人底血肉情绪！

    五十八、一九五五年一月十一日李正廉给胡风信（自上海）
    你可以想像这些日子所听到的噪音，是怎样使唯一能欣赏音乐的耳朵也失灵了。这里、那里的不协和音，和无基调性，简直令人诅咒。……
    〔噪音〕指对于胡风的批判。
    五十九、一九五五年二月十六日华田给耿庸信（自南京）
    我这里，正在要做出批判资产阶级文艺思想在教学上的表现的形势来。已有人指手划脚的在“要求”我。可怕的牛二买刀式的风气漫开了。真无聊。您说是吃饱饭无事做，却也不是，说是凑热闹的性格，倒是有的，但也不全是；奇形怪状。
    我虽浅薄，良心还有。活一天就他妈的“拖”一天。韧性还需要！
    〔我这里〕指南京工业会计统计学校。华田在这个学校教语文。
    　〔牛二买刀〕指“水浒传”中杨志卖刀、流氓牛二向他无理取闹，
        杨志怒杀牛二的故事。这里，胡风集团分子华田把我们对资产阶
        级思想的批判，比做流氓的无理取闹。
    六、胡风集团疯狂地仇恨人民民主专政和新社会的一切，梦想中国共产党和人民革命政权的灭亡
    六十、一九五×年五月二十三日阿垅给罗洛信（自天津）
    好的，让人们疯狂，从疯狂里灭亡。
    六十一、一九五×年七月三十一日阿垅给罗洛信（自天津）
    这也好。坟是愈挖愈深的，台是愈搭愈高的；那么，如果一面是深坟而另一面是高台，跌下来时就呜呼完蛋了。
    六十二、一九五×年六月二十日芦甸给胡风信（自天津）
    目前，那些枯黄的叶子正纷纷下落，落在芽子身上，想把芽子压死。可是它们没有想到，它们自己正在腐朽；它们没有想到，芽子正冲开它们腐朽的尸体茁壮地生长起来。自然，也有些脆弱的芽子会被压死的。
    〔枯黄的叶子〕〔它们自己正在腐朽〕〔腐朽的尸体〕这些都是
         胡风分子污蔑我们革命队伍的说法。
    〔芽子〕这是胡风分子指他们自己。
      按：如同我们经常在估计国际国内阶级斗争力量对比的形势一样，敌人也在经常估计这种形势。但我们的敌人是落后的腐朽的反动派，他们是注定要灭亡的，他们不懂得客观世界的规律，他们用以想事的方法是主观主义的和形而上学的方法，因此他们的估计总是错误的。他们的阶级本能引导他们老是在想：他们自己怎样了不起，而革命势力总是不行的。他们总是高估了自己的力量，低估了我们的力量。我们亲眼看到了许多的反革命：清朝政府，北洋军阀，日本军国主义，莫索里尼，希特勒，蒋介石，一个一个地倒下去了，他们犯了并且不可能不犯思想和行动的错误。现在的一切帝国主义也是一定要犯这种错误的。难道这不好笑吗？照胡风分子说来，共产党领导的中国人民革命力量是要“呜呼完蛋”的，这种力量不过是“枯黄的叶子”和“腐朽的尸体”。而胡风分子所代表的反革命力量呢？虽然“有些脆弱的芽子会被压死的”，但是大批的芽子却“正冲开”什么东西而要“茁壮地生长起来”。如果说，法国资产阶级的国民议会里至今还有保皇党的代表人物的话，那末，在地球上全部剥削阶级彻底灭亡之后多少年内，很可能还会有蒋介石王朝的代表人物在各地活动着。这些人中的最死硬分子是永远不会承认他们的失败的。这是因为他们不但需要欺骗别人，也需要欺骗他们自己，不然他们就不能过日子。我们看，胡风分子为什么狂妄得那么可笑呢？原来他们是按着他们阶级本能的曲调走路的。
  六十三、一九五二年二月三日牛汉给胡风信（自沈阳）
    也许再过几十年以后我想在中国才可以办到人与人没有矛盾；人的庄严与真实，才不受到损伤。今天，却正因为一个人庄严，真实，才受到损伤。……今天中国，人还是不尊敬人的，人还是污损人的。人还是不尊敬一个劳动者，人还是不尊敬创造自己劳动。这是中国的耻辱。我气愤得很。
      按：这个胡风分子是比较悲观的。他说“也许”要“再过几十年”才“可以办到人与人没有矛盾”，即是说，要有几十年时间，蒋介石王朝才有复辟的希望。几十年之后，蒋介石王朝回来了，一切人民革命力量都被压倒了，那就是“人与人没有矛盾”了。“人的庄严与真实，才不受到损伤”了，这个“人”指的是一切反革命的人，包括胡风分子在内，但是一个也不包括革命的人。“今天中国，人还是不尊敬人的……”上人指革命的人，下人指反革命的人。胡风分子写文章，即使是在写密信，也会有些文理不通的。这也是被他们的阶级本质所决定的，他们无法像我们替他们作注解的时候这样，把文理弄得很清楚。
    六十四、一九五○年四月十六日谢韬给胡风信（自北京）
    两周来，真成了教书匠了，整天上课下课。新教学法把人弄得精疲力竭。教书本来是用头脑的工作，现在变成几乎完全可以不用脑袋了。
    〔新教学法〕胡风分子谢韬在中国人民大学任教，这里他公然反
         对新的教育方法，并污蔑今天的教育工作“可以不用脑袋”。
    六十五、一九五一年二月十八日张中晓给胡风信
    本来我对于所谓“组织生活”是非常疑惑的事。在那里所要求的是“思想的平均分数”；其训练方法，恐怕是和希相去无几的。受训之后，精神弄得瘟头瘟脑是不必说的了。
    我想，A·纪德在那本书中说过的有些话，用在现在是相当恰当的。
    〔和希相去无几〕“希”即希特勒。张中晓污蔑我们训练干部的
         方法和希特勒差不多。〔A·纪德在那本书中……〕法国没落资
         产阶级作家A·纪德曾写过一本“从苏联归来”，无耻地污蔑和
         反对苏联，胡风分子张中晓认为可以借用A·纪德污蔑苏联的话
        来污蔑新中国，这里完全暴露了胡风集团对新中国的仇恨。
    六十六、一九五一年五月二十五日张中晓给胡风信（自绍兴）
    你没有写文章。但我也感到，某种环境下的沉默，足以灭亡的。
    当然，我知道你的不写文章，是对于敌情的估计和战略、战术上的问题。
    我知道，整个中国起了彻底的搅动；而那些封建潜力正在疯狂的杀人。范围底广大，固然史无前例，而发生的事件也是史无前例的。斗争必然地深化了。
    按：这封信里所谓“那些封建潜力正在疯狂的杀人”乃是胡风反革命集团对于我国人民革命力量镇压反革命力量的伟大斗争感觉恐怖的表现，这种感觉代表了一切反革命的阶级、集团和个人。他们感觉恐怖的事，正是革命的人民大众感觉高兴的事。“史无前例”也是对的。从来的革命，除了奴隶制代替原始公社制那一次是以剥削制度代替非剥削制度以外，其余的都是以一种剥削制度代替另一种剥削制度为其结果的，他们没有必要也没有可能去作彻底镇压反革命的事情。只有我们，只有无产阶级和共产党领导的人民大众的革命，是以最后消灭任何剥削制度和任何阶级为目标的革命，被消灭的阶级无论如何是要经由它们的反革命政党、集团或某些个人出来反抗的，而人民大众则必须团结起来坚决、彻底、干尽、全部地将这些反抗势力镇压下去。只有这时，才有这种必要，也才有这种可能。“斗争必然地深化了”，这也说得一点不错。只是“封建潜力”几个字说错了，这是“无产阶级和共产党领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政”一语的反话，如同他们所说的“机械论”是“辩证唯物论”的反话一样。
  六十七、一九五○年七月二十七日张中晓给胡风信（自绍兴）
    我过去曾写过一些杂文和诗，现在待身体较再好一点，我准备再写。二年来，我脾气变了许多，几乎恨一切人……对这个社会秩序，我憎恨。
    按：还是这个张中晓，他的反革命感觉是很灵的，较之我们革命队伍里的好些人，包括一部分共产党员在内，阶级觉悟的高低，政治嗅觉的灵钝，是大相悬殊的。在这个对比上，我们的好些人，比起胡风集团里的人来，是大大不如的。我们的人必须学习，必须提高阶级警觉性，政治嗅觉必须放灵些。如果说胡风集团能给我们一些什么积极的东西，那就是借着这一次惊心动魄的斗争，大大地提高我们的政治觉悟和政治敏感，坚决地将一切反革命分子镇压下去，而使我们的革命专政大大地巩固起来，以便将革命进行到底，达到建成伟大的社会主义国家的目的。
