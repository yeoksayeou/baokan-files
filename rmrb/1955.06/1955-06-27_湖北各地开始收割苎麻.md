Hubei Province, the largest ramie producer in the country, has begun harvesting its first crop of ramie (the first harvest of the plant). According to estimates from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the 47 counties in the province that produce ramie will generally see a 5% increase in the yield of the first crop compared to 1954, with the province-wide yield of the first crop reaching 12 million jin. In the E'nan region, where ramie planting area accounts for 60% of the province, the best first crop ramie in ten counties including Yangxin, Daye, and Puchi, is six to seven chi tall, and the yield per unit area can reach 120 to 130 jin. Although the first crop ramie in Enshi, Jianshi, Lichuan and other counties in the western Hubei region suffered from frost damage this spring, the general yield can still reach the level of 1954.

    湖北各地开始收割苎麻
    全国产苎麻最多的湖北省，已经开始收割头麻（第一次收割的麻）。据省农业厅估计，全省产苎麻的四十七个县，今年的头麻一般能比一九五四年增产百分之五，全省头麻产量在一千二百万斤。苎麻种植面积占全省百分之六十的鄂南地区阳新、大冶、蒲圻等十个县，最好的头麻有六、七尺高，单位面积产量可以达到一百二、三十斤。鄂西地区的恩施、建始、利川等县，头麻虽然在今年春季受了冻害，但一般产量还可以达到一九五四年的水平。（袁军）
