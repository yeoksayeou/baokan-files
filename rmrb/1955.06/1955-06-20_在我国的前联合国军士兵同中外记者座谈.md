Xinhua News Agency, June 18th. On June 18th, the nineteen former UN soldiers currently in China held a symposium with Chinese and foreign journalists after issuing a statement at the Chinese Red Cross. A spokesman for the Chinese Red Cross emphasized that as they voluntarily chose to remain in China, the Red Cross will continue to provide all possible assistance. However, at any time, any of them can freely leave China, and the Red Cross will provide assistance in the same way.

The nineteen former UN soldiers remaining in China said they regretted that the five people would be leaving. While these five people were in China, they were their friends, and even though they are leaving, they still consider them friends. These nineteen tanned men came together from different parts of China. Twelve of them are studying at the China People's University in Beijing, and seven are working in the state-owned paper mill in Jinan, Shandong. The five who wish to leave had worked on a state-owned farm and later in an agricultural machinery factory in Henan.

Lowell Skinner said that he lives well in the paper mill in Shandong. He said that when he arrived at the factory, he did not know much about machines, but now he has been promoted to a first-class mechanic and will soon be promoted again. He said that there were difficulties at first, but the Red Cross and the workers helped him overcome them. "After living in China for more than a year, I believe I made a good decision."

Richard Tennyson spoke at the meeting about how his mother could not come to China. "Around Thanksgiving last year, my mother tried to come here. She asked me what the chances were. I asked the Red Cross what arrangements could be made. In about five days, I received a reply that she could reside in China." The Chinese Red Cross told him that they would bear all her expenses. But the U.S. State Department prevented her from coming to China.

A reporter asked why the five people who are leaving China did not attend the symposium. The spokesman for the Chinese Red Cross replied that they had been invited to attend the meeting, but they did not come. "They are free to come or not. If the reporters wish, and if these people are willing, the reporters can visit them at their hotel."

    在我国的前联合国军士兵同中外记者座谈
    新华社十八日讯　六月十八日，现在中国的十九名前联合国军士兵在中国红十字会发表声明之后，同中外记者进行了座谈。中国红十字会发言人强调指出，当他们自愿选择留在中国的时候，红十字会将继续予以一切可能的协助；但任何时候，他们之中的任何人都可以自由离开中国，红十字会将同样地予以协助。
    留在中国的十九个前联合国军士兵们说，他们对这五个人将离开这里表示遗憾，当这五个人在中国的时候，他们是他们的朋友，虽然他们将离开，他们仍旧认为他们是朋友。这十九个晒得黑黑的人是从中国的不同地方来到一起的。其中十二个人正在北京的中国人民大学学习，七个人正在山东济南的国营造纸厂中工作，希望离开的五个人曾在一个国营农场中工作，随后又在河南的一个农业机器厂中工作。
    洛威尔·斯金纳说，他在山东造纸厂中生活得很好。他说，当他到工厂去的时候，他不大懂机器，可是现在已被提升为一级机工，不久还会再被提升。他说，起初是有困难的，可是红十字会和工人们帮助他克服了困难。“在中国住了一年多之后，我相信我作出了一个好的决定。”
    理查德·坦尼逊在会上谈到他的母亲如何不能到中国来。“在去年感恩节前后，我的母亲曾设法来此。她问我机会怎样。我问红十字会可以作些什么安排。在大约五天之内，我就得到答复说，她可以在中国居留。”中国红十字会告诉他，他们将负担她的全部费用。但是美国国务院阻止她到中国来。
    一个记者问，为什么要离开中国的五个人没有参加这个座谈会。中国红十字会发言人回答说，曾邀请他们参加这个会，但是他们没有来。“他们可以随便来或者不来。如果记者们希望，而且这几个人也愿意的话，记者们可以到他们的旅馆去访问他们。”
