      The Second Day in Jakarta
    April 27, Wednesday
    From 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia, Vice President Hatta, Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, Foreign Minister Sunarjo, and Indonesian Ambassador to China Mononutu held talks with Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu, and Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Huang Zhen at the Merdeka Palace.
    It is hoped and believed that by the end of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit, the friendly relations between China and Indonesia will be further solidified.
    At 11:15 AM, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by Indonesian Foreign Minister Sunarjo, visited the Indonesian Parliament and held a 45-minute meeting with Speaker Sardjono, Deputy Speakers Tambunan and Arudji Kartawinata, and Chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, Moise.
    Afterwards, Speaker Sardjono told reporters that Premier Zhou Enlai had formally invited a delegation of Indonesian parliamentarians to visit China.
    Soon after, Antara News Agency also reported that following the talks this morning, Ali Sastroamidjojo had accepted the formal invitation from Premier Zhou Enlai and agreed to visit China in the near future.
    Every moment of the Chinese delegation's stay here makes people feel that the friendship between Indonesia and China is constantly growing.
    The Chinese delegation's program for the afternoon was to meet with overseas Chinese.
    Since learning that the delegation of the People's Republic of China was going to visit Indonesia, more than 600 representatives of overseas Chinese from all over Indonesia have been sent to Jakarta. Their common purpose is: to meet the relatives from the great motherland and to pay their respects to the people of the motherland through them.
    They came from every corner of this archipelago, from Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, from the Lesser Sunda Islands, from more than a hundred cities on all these islands. They represent all strata of overseas Chinese society, including those from the business and education sectors; workers, youth, women, and respected elders. Many of them have been waiting in Jakarta hotels for days, even ten days to half a month, just to welcome the representatives of the motherland this afternoon.
    More than two million overseas Chinese in Indonesia, regardless of region or class, elected so many representatives, united together, to hold such a grand meeting, which is the first time in history.
    The venue was borrowed from the Chinese Embassy. At 2:00 PM, Premier Zhou Enlai and Jakarta Mayor Sudiro arrived, and the reception began.
    Hong Yuanyuan, Chairman of the Indonesian Chinese General Association, delivered the first speech. He paid tribute to Premier Zhou Enlai and the members of the delegation on behalf of all overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Finally, he said: "Respected Premier Zhou, all of us overseas Chinese in Indonesia love our motherland, and we guarantee to work hard to strengthen the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese themselves and to strengthen the patriotic unity with the Indonesian people."
    Premier Zhou Enlai then addressed the audience amidst warm applause: As he did at the reception for overseas Chinese in Bandung two days ago, he explained in detail the international status and foreign policy of New China to the overseas Chinese. He repeatedly asked overseas Chinese not to become arrogant because China has stood up and become strong, but to respect the people of the countries where they reside, and to get along with them in friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation. His more than one-hour long, calm and thorough speech always captivated the audience and repeatedly aroused warm applause.
    Mayor Sudiro was then invited to speak. He first said that he had quoted Napoleon in the past, saying that China was a sleeping lion, and once it woke up, it would shake the world; now China has woken up and shaken the world. However, its rise and strength will not invade others. He said that he was very moved by Premier Zhou's warning to overseas Chinese not to be arrogant. Finally, he shouted "Long live Indonesian-Chinese friendship!"
    In the Chinese-style hall of the embassy, ​​a feeling of reunion was filled. All the overseas Chinese enthusiastically sought out people from the motherland or compatriots who they rarely had the opportunity to meet to talk. Everyone felt that under this roof, they were in their own home.
    The reception ended at 4:00 PM, and Premier Zhou personally shook hands with the overseas Chinese who were leaving at the door. Some overseas Chinese had tears of joy in their eyes when they left the embassy.
    At 8:00 PM, Ambassador Huang Zhen held another reception at the embassy, ​​and the Chinese delegation was about to say goodbye to Indonesian friends.
    This was another rare event, attended by 800 people.
    President Sukarno personally attended the reception. Antara News Agency reported: "The guests present believed that President Sukarno's attendance at this reception was 'unusual', as this was the first time the President had attended a public gathering at a foreign embassy."
    In the evening, Indonesian Radio broadcast Premier Zhou Enlai's broadcast speech to the Indonesian people.
    Premier Zhou Enlai praised the enthusiastic and wise people and the beautiful and rich land of Indonesia, and praised the important role played by the Indonesian government and people in promoting the success of the Asian-African Conference.
    He said: "China and Indonesia... both need a lasting and peaceful international environment to build our countries. At the same time, China and Indonesia, like Indonesia, have not yet achieved complete independence and unity. Our territory of Taiwan, like West Irian in Indonesia, has not yet been liberated. ...The Chinese people cherish the friendship of the Indonesian people very much. The Chinese people are willing to work hand in hand with the Indonesian people to safeguard their respective national rights and the great cause of safeguarding world peace."

    人民的心同亚非会议在一起
    ——亚非会议日记

      在雅加达的第二天
    四月二十七日　星期三
    上午九点钟到十一点钟，印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺、副总统哈达、总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约、外交部长苏纳约和印度尼西亚驻中国大使莫诺努图，同中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来、副总理陈毅、对外贸易部长叶季壮、外交部副部长章汉夫和中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇在独立宫举行了会谈。
    人们期望而且深信，在周恩来总理这次访问结束的时候，中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的友好关系将进一步确定下来。
    十一点十五分，周恩来总理和陈毅副总理由印度尼西亚外交部长苏纳约陪同访问了印度尼西亚国会，同议长沙多诺、副议长谭布兰、阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔和国会外交小组委员会主席莫伊斯作了四十五分钟的会谈。
    事后，沙多诺议长告诉记者们说，周恩来总理已经正式邀请印度尼西亚国会议员代表团访问中国。
    不久，安塔拉通讯社也发表消息说，在今天早上的会谈以后，阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约已经接受周恩来总理提出来的正式邀请，同意在最近期间访问中国了。
    中国代表团在这里的每一个时刻都叫人感到印度尼西亚和中国间的友谊在不断生长。
    中国代表团下午的节目是同华侨见面。
    自从知道中华人民共和国代表团要访问印度尼西亚以后，印度尼西亚各地华侨已经陆续派遣了六百多名代表到雅加达来。他们的共同目的是：见一见从伟大的祖国来的亲人，并且通过他们向祖国人民致敬。
    他们从这个千岛之国的每一个角落，从爪哇、从苏门答腊、从加里曼丹、从苏拉威西、从小巽他，从所有这些岛上的一百多个城市来到这里。他们代表了华侨社会的各个阶层，有工商界的，文教界的；有职工、青年、妇女，也有年高望重的老人家。他们中间很多已经在雅加达的旅馆里等了好几天，甚至十天半个月了，就为的要在今天下午来招待祖国的代表们。
    全印度尼西亚二百多万华侨，不分地区和阶层，推选这么多名代表，团结在一起，举行这样的盛会，在历史上还是第一次。
    地点是借的中国大使馆。下午两点钟，周恩来总理和雅加达市长苏迪罗都到了，招待会也就开始了。
    印度尼西亚华侨总会主席洪渊源首先致辞。他代表全印度尼西亚侨胞向周恩来总理和代表团团员致敬。最后他说：“敬爱的周总理，我们印度尼西亚华侨都是热爱祖国的，我们保证为加强华侨本身的爱国大团结，为加强同印度尼西亚人民的爱国大团结而努力。”
    周恩来总理接着在热烈的掌声中同大家讲话：同两天以前在万隆华侨的招待会上一样，他向侨胞们详细说明了新中国的国际地位和外交政策，他一再要求海外侨胞不要因为中国站起来了，强大了，就骄傲起来，而要尊重侨居国的人民，同他们友好相处，互助合作。他的一个多钟头安详、透彻的发言始终吸住了听众，并且一再引起了热烈的掌声。
    苏迪罗市长接着应邀发言。他首先说，我过去曾引用过拿破仑的一句话，说中国是一只睡狮，一旦醒来的时候就会震动全世界；现在中国是已经醒来而且震动了全世界了。但是，他的兴起和强大都不会去侵略别人。他说他对周总理告诫海外华侨不要骄傲感到非常感动。最后他高呼“印中友好万岁！”
    在大使馆的中国式的大厅里，充满了一种骨肉团聚的感情。所有的侨胞都热情地找祖国来的人或者找平时难得见面的同胞谈话。大家都感到，在这个屋顶下，就是在自己家里。
    酒会到四点钟结束，周总理亲自在门口同辞别出去的侨胞握手。有的侨胞在离开大使馆时，眼睛里噙着欢喜的泪水。
    晚上八点钟，黄镇大使在大使馆举行了另一个招待会，中国代表团要同印度尼西亚的朋友告别了。
    这又是一个稀有的盛会，到会的有八百人。
    苏加诺总统亲自来参加了招待会。安塔拉通讯社报道说：“与会的来宾们都认为，苏加诺总统参加这次招待会是‘不平常的’，这是总统前往一国使馆参加公开性聚会的第一次。”
    晚上，印度尼西亚电台广播了周恩来总理对印度尼西亚人民的广播演说。
    周恩来总理赞扬了印度尼西亚热情而智慧的人民和美丽而富饶的土地，赞扬了印度尼西亚政府和人民在推动亚非会议取得成就方面所起的重大作用。
    他说：“中国和印度尼西亚……都需要有一个持久和平的国际环境来建设我们的国家。同时，中国和印度尼西亚一样还没有取得完全的独立和统一，我国的领土台湾像印度尼西亚的西伊里安一样还没有解放，……中国人民十分珍视印度尼西亚人民的友谊。中国人民愿意和印度尼西亚人民为维护各自的民族权利和保障世界和平的伟大事业携手并进。”         （待续）
