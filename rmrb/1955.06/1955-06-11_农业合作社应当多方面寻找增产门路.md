Agricultural cooperatives have many superior conditions for developing production that mutual aid teams and individual farmers do not have when implementing collective management. Everyone knows this. However, if these conditions are not well utilized, they cannot have any effect. For example, many newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Licheng and other counties in Shandong Province only focus on the existing few plots of land and do not seek other ways to increase production. There is surplus labor and animal power, and other means of production cannot be fully utilized. As a result, some cooperatives are forced to have "shifts" because there are "more people than work"; some cooperatives send a cart of manure with many people following, and everyone records a work point; some cooperatives have too little work, and the cooperative staff assigns more work to poor peasants and less to middle peasants, causing dissatisfaction among middle peasants; some individual cooperative members are afraid that women's participation in labor will divide work points, so they restrict female members from participating in cooperative labor; individual cooperative members are afraid of not getting work points, so they let the cattle be idle and use manpower to plow the land.

In agricultural production cooperatives where these phenomena occur, members doubt whether they can increase their income and are emotionally unstable. They say: If we don't do much work, what will we get in the autumn? The cooperative staff are troubled by the lack of a solution to this problem, and the unity of the poor and middle peasants has also been affected to a certain extent.

The root cause of these phenomena is that the leaders of the cooperatives have not appropriately arranged production and sought ways and means to increase production from multiple aspects according to the new situation after the cooperative was established. In fact, there are many ways to increase production, not to mention the diverse sideline productions. Even regarding the basic construction of land, there are many things to do. For example, agricultural production cooperatives in mountainous areas can create conditions for increasing production by improving land and developing forestry and animal husbandry; agricultural production cooperatives in plain areas can create conditions for increasing production by digging wells and opening canals, processing land, and cultivating intensively. The Liming First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liwanhe Village, Changli County, has an average of just over two mu of land per person, and even during the busiest farming season, there is surplus labor. Later, the cooperative organized a part of the labor force to find fertilizer sources and exchange pit soil. The labor force changed from surplus to insufficient, the fertilizer increased, the work points earned by the members also increased, and the emotions were generally high.

Newly established cooperatives have begun to change from "small farmers" to "large farmers," and it is difficult to arrange large-scale collective production. Especially in areas with more people and less land, leaders need to spend more brainpower. However, it must be recognized that the conditions for further developing production are fully present. Many old cooperatives can continue to advance on the basis of continuous years of increasing production, and the production potential and conditions for increasing production in new cooperatives are even richer. If these conditions are not seen and the old leadership methods are adopted, it will definitely cause dissatisfaction among the members and the disintegration of the cooperative. Farmers join the cooperative to develop production and increase income. Finding ways to increase production and letting members see these ways, confirming that increasing production is possible, is an important material factor in consolidating agricultural production cooperatives.

    农业合作社应当多方面寻找增产门路
    仲夏
    农业生产合作社实行集体经营，有许多互助组和个体农民所不能有的发展生产的优越条件，这是人人都知道的道理。但是，如果不能很好地运用这些条件，它是不能发生什么作用的。例如，山东历城等县就有不少新建立的农业生产合作社，只在现有的几块土地上打主意，不找寻其它的增产门路，劳力畜力都有剩余，其他生产资料也不能充分发生作用。结果，有些社因“人多活少”而被迫“轮班”干活；有些社送一车粪要跟上很多人，每人都记一工；有些社活路太少，社的工作人员给贫农多派工，给中农少派工，引起中农不满，有些社怕妇女参加劳动分了工分，就限制女社员参加社内劳动；个别社社员怕得不到工分，让牛闲着，却用人力刨地。
    发生这些现象的农业生产合作社，社员对于能否增加收入发生怀疑，情绪动荡不安。他们说：干不了多少活，秋后分什么？社的工作人员苦于没有办法解决这个问题，中贫农的团结也受了一定的影响。
    产生这些现象的根本原因，是社的领导人员没有根据合作以后发生的新情况，适当地安排生产，多方面找寻增产的方法和门路。其实，增产的门路是很多的。且不说多种多样的副业生产。就是关于土地的基本建设，也有许多事情可做。例如，山区的农业生产合作社可以从改良土地、发展林牧业等方面来创造增产条件；平原地区的农业生产合作社可以打井开渠、土地加工、精耕细作等方面来创造增产的条件。昌黎县犁湾河村黎明第一农业生产合作社每人平均只有二亩多地，就在农活最紧张时，劳力也有剩余。后来社里组织一部分劳动力找肥源换坑土，劳动力由剩余变为不足，肥料增加了，社员得的工分也多了，情绪普遍高涨。
    新建立的社开始由“小农户”变为“大农户”，安排集体的大生产，是有一定困难的。特别是在人多地少的地区，领导人员更要多花费些脑筋。但是，必须认识到进一步发展生产的条件是充分存在的。许多老社在连年增产的基础上还能不断前进，新社的生产潜力和增产条件，更要丰富一些。看不见这些条件，采用老一套的领导方法，是一定会引起社员的不满和社的涣散的。农民入社就是为的发展生产增加收入，找寻增加生产的门路，让社员看到这些门路，确信增产是可能的，这是巩固农业生产合作社的重要的物质因素。
