    Eliminate Counter-Revolutionaries and Guarantee the Victory of National Construction
    Shang Yue
    The revolution has achieved great victory, and the socialist construction of the motherland is developing rapidly. This is what each of us cheers for, and also what all counter-revolutionaries hate. Therefore, all counter-revolutionaries, including the Hu Feng group, harbor hatred. They hate this social order and hate all of us.
    We actively unite under the banner of the Party, working hard, studying, and building. They, on the other hand, are actively engaged in division, creating dissatisfaction, and carrying out sabotage. Judging from the large amount of material exposed in the "People's Daily," wherever there are members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, there is unrest, and work cannot proceed smoothly. In the past, some comrades were careless, thinking it was a matter of ideology or personal style. Now the facts prove that this view is completely wrong.
    Now, we realize that Hu Feng's cunning two-faced tactics are precisely the means by which the American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents are waging a "heart-digging war" against us.
    The Party's timely exposure of the crimes of this counter-revolutionary group is a great victory for our revolutionary cause. But on the other hand, this incident has seriously educated us: If we do not firmly and actively stand under the banner of the Party, if we do not enthusiastically unite around the Party, if we do not overcome our liberalism and individual heroism, if we do not study theory and correct our principled stance, we are always in danger of being dragged into the quagmire of counter-revolution by class enemies.
    We should raise our revolutionary vigilance, and we must realize that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is by no means the only poisonous arrow that undermines our revolutionary cause. Therefore, we request the People's Government to resolutely and thoroughly suppress the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and eliminate all hidden enemies. On the other hand, we must seriously distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and actively help the government and the Party to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries. Only in this way can we guarantee the victorious success of the socialist construction cause of our great motherland.

    消灭反革命分子，保证祖国建设的胜利
    尚钺
    革命取得了伟大的胜利，祖国社会主义建设在一日千里地发展着。这是我们每一个人所欢呼的，同时也是一切反革命分子所仇视的。所以，包括胡风集团在内的一切反革命分子都在憎恶。他们憎恶这个社会秩序，憎恨我们一切人。
    我们积极团结在党的旗帜之下，努力工作、学习和建设。他们却在积极地搞分裂、制造不满，进行破坏。从“人民日报”上揭发的大量材料看，什么地方有胡风反革命集团分子，什么地方就不安宁，工作就不能顺利进行。过去有些同志麻痹大意，以为是思想问题，个人作风问题。现在事实证明了，这种看法是完全错误的。
    现在，我们认识到：胡风这种狡猾的两面派手法，恰恰是美蒋特务对我们进行“挖心战”的手法。
    党及时地揭发了这个反革命集团的罪行，这是我们革命事业的一大胜利。但另一方面，这一事件却严肃地教育了我们：我们如果不坚决积极地站在党的旗帜之下，不热情地团结在党的周围，不克服我们的自由主义、个人英雄主义的毛病，不学习理论端正我们的原则立场，随时都有被阶级敌人拉到反革命的泥坑里去的危险。
    我们应该提高革命的警惕性，要认识到胡风反革命集团，决不是破坏我们革命事业的唯一的毒箭。因此，我们请求人民政府坚决彻底地镇压胡风反革命集团，消灭一切暗藏的敌人。另方面，我们要严肃分清敌、我，积极地帮助政府和党肃清一切反革命分子。只有这样，才能保证我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业的胜利成功。
