    Against Exclusive Military Blocs
    Aina
    The World Peace Conference opens in Helsinki today. One of the important issues to be discussed at the conference is the issue of military blocs. The root of the current international tension is the "strength" policy of the United States, and the establishment of military blocs and aggressive alliances is precisely the military-political manifestation of the US "strength" policy. Therefore, peace-loving people around the world rightly believe that in order to maintain peace, it is necessary to oppose and stop the policy of exclusive military blocs.

    In the decade since the war, the American ruling group, according to Wall Street's strategy of establishing a world empire, has intensified its pursuit of a policy of military blocs. The United States has established military bases around the world aimed primarily at the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China; according to the US government's own disclosure, there are 950 of them. The various military blocs and aggressive alliances that the United States has been and is putting together cover almost the entire world.

    Looking at a map, from Latin America to Western Europe, from the Middle East to Southeast Asia, there is no place without the threat of American military blocs and aggressive alliances. Here is a summary of the military blocs or aggressive alliances established by the United States in recent years:

    (1) The earliest military bloc established by the United States after the war was the "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance," signed in Rio de Janeiro in September 1947. This treaty strengthened American military control over Latin American countries.

    (2) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established in April 1949. This group includes the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Portugal, Greece, and Turkey. With the signing of the US-Spanish Pact in September 1953, Spain has in fact been brought into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization through the back door. Now, with the ratification of the Paris Agreements, militarized West Germany has become the fifteenth official member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This has greatly strengthened the aggressiveness of this bloc and has deepened the threat of war in Europe.

    (3) The so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," signed in September 1954, has an even more blatant colonial nature. Apart from the three Asian countries that have signed military aid agreements with the United States, none of the participants in this treaty are Asian countries. This military alliance not only supports the US policy in the Far East, which is primarily directed against the People's Republic of China, but also facilitates US aggression against other Asian countries.

    (4) In the Middle East, American imperialism is adopting a roundabout approach, drawing Middle Eastern countries individually or in pairs into various war alliances under its protection. For example, the Turkish-Pakistani Agreement of 1954 and the Turkish-Iraqi Military Treaty of February 1955 were both concluded under American arrangement. Everyone understands that it is not the countries of the Middle East that need to establish military blocs in this region, but precisely the US aggressive bloc. It attempts to eventually turn these alliances into subordinate parts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    (5) In addition, there are other series of various military treaties, such as the "ANZUS Security Treaty" signed in 1951; a series of treaties signed with Japan from 1951 to 1954; the US-ROK treaty of 1953; the US-Chiang treaty of 1954, etc. These military treaties have nothing to do with the need to maintain peace and security; they are entirely out of the aggressive "strength policy" and for the purpose of preparing for a new war.
                ×××

    The American aggressive bloc is using the policy of establishing military blocs of some countries against other countries to counter the policy of peaceful coexistence (regardless of their socio-political systems) pursued by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all peace-loving countries for the purpose of peace and security. They also create all kinds of false pretexts to confuse public opinion, in order to cover up their aggressive conspiracies and facilitate the organization of military blocs. They wear the cloak of the United Nations Charter, insisting that their actions of trampling on the United Nations Charter and creating aggressive military blocs are for the purpose of upholding the United Nations Charter. They use words like "defense," "peace," "freedom," and "security" to mask their aggressive essence. They also greatly promote the myth of a "communist threat," insisting that the task of these military blocs they are putting together is to prevent the "threat of communism." In order to conceal its ulterior motives of aggression, the American aggressive bloc has had to consistently resort to hypocritical words. But although liars endlessly tell lies, ruthless facts have long exposed these lies and exposed the cunning face of the American aggressive bloc.

    First of all, the US pursuit of a policy of military blocs is a gross violation of the United Nations Charter. The basic spirit of the United Nations Charter is to maintain world peace and security, while the military blocs put together by the United States only exacerbate international tensions and deepen the war crisis. The American aggressive bloc's distorted use of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter regarding the right of collective self-defense cannot deceive anyone, because people know that the right of self-defense stipulated in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter can only be exercised when a country is subjected to armed attack. However, when the United States organized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, there was no situation of being subjected to armed attack or threat of armed attack. Facts have proved that the United States is only using the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Manila Pact as tools for carrying out "cold war" and aggression, completely undermining the spirit of the United Nations Charter. The United States also distorts Chapter 8 of the United Nations Charter regarding regional arrangements and regional agencies as a pretext for putting together military blocs. But the North Atlantic Treaty Organization includes countries from two hemispheres, and the member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are scattered across four continents, and without the participation of the major countries in this region, what kind of regional arrangement or agency is this?

    Not only that, but the actions of the organizers of these military blocs in trampling on the United Nations Charter are also manifested in seizing the powers that should only belong to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. Everyone knows that only the Security Council has the right to determine the state of aggression or the threat of aggression, but the organizers of these military blocs—the United States—unjustifiably seize these most important powers into their own hands, using this power to legalize American interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

    Secondly, the military blocs and alliances put together by the United States are all exclusive. It does not want the participation of countries that are truly working for peace, but only gathers countries that can serve its war policy. The United States rejected the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty, but hastily dragged West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is clear evidence. Everyone knows that rearming West Germany and dragging it into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can only seriously threaten peace and security in Europe.

    Third, facts have proved that greatly promoting the non-existent "communist threat" is the banner used by the United States to put together military blocs and expand American hegemony. This old black banner was stolen by American monopolists from Hitler. Over the years, we can see that the United States uses this black banner to organize military blocs and carry out political and military expansion in all parts of the capitalist world. Under the cover of this black banner, it has put shackles on Latin American countries, bound its North Atlantic Treaty partners to the American war chariot with West Germany as the core, and controlled old colonial countries, colluding with them to suppress the Southeast Asian national liberation movement...

    Fourth, all military blocs under American control are unequal alliances. American officials hypocritically speak of fine words such as the "free world family" and the "pan-European family," only to cover up the irreconcilable contradictions within it. These military blocs are like any monopoly organization, operating entirely according to the will of the "major shareholder" (the United States). Any country dragged into a military bloc by the United States will have its internal affairs subjected to American interference; its territory will directly or indirectly become American military bases; its economy will be controlled by the US dollar.

    The history of modern international relations proves that the formation of aggressive military blocs often leads to large-scale bloody wars. Before the First World War, there was the German-Austrian alliance, which later developed into the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy; before the Second World War, there was the "Berlin-Rome Axis," which later developed into the Anti-Comintern Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan. These blocs all became tools for launching world wars. Now, American imperialists are once again following the old path of Wilhelm II and Hitler, attempting to drag the world into a new slaughter by establishing exclusive military blocs.

    However, today's international situation is completely different. Historical experience has made people learn their lessons. They realize that preventing any exclusive military bloc is a necessary condition for preventing a new danger of war. The twenty-nine Asian and African countries unanimously opposed the organization of aggressive military blocs at the historic Bandung Conference; the eight European countries took measures to prevent war and strengthen security at the Warsaw Conference, and called on all European countries (regardless of their systems) to establish a European collective security system. After the Asian-African Conference and the Warsaw Conference, the idea of peaceful coexistence has increasingly taken root in the hearts of the people. More and more people understand that peaceful coexistence between different social systems is possible. The increasingly widespread public concern for peace is forming the basis for an effective struggle against the establishment of any military bloc. The people of the world, having learned from history, are determined and confident that their demands will be realized.

    反对排他性的军事集团
    艾纳
    世界和平大会今天在赫尔辛基开幕了。大会将要讨论的重要问题之一就是军事集团问题。目前国际紧张局势的根源是美国的“实力”政策，而建立军事集团和侵略性的联盟，正是美国“实力”政策在军事—政治方面的表现。因之，世界爱好和平的人民正当地认为，为了维护和平，必须反对和制止排他性的军事集团的政策。
    战后十年来，美国统治集团根据华尔街建立世界帝国的战略，加紧推行着军事集团的政策。美国在全世界建立以苏联和中华人民共和国为主要敌对目标的军事基地，据美国官方自己透露就有九百五十个。美国已经和正在拼凑的各种各样的军事集团和侵略联盟，几乎遍及全世界。
    翻开地图看看，从拉丁美洲到西欧，从中、近东到东南亚，没有一处不存在着美国军事集团和侵略联盟的威胁。这里综述美国近年来建立的军事集团或侵略联盟如下：
    （一）战后美国最早建立的军事集团是一九四七年九月在里约热内卢签订的“西半球防御公约”，这个公约加强了美国对拉丁美洲国家的军事控制。
    （二）一九四九年四月成立了北大西洋集团。这个集团包括美国、英国、法国、意大利、加拿大、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、丹麦、挪威、冰岛、葡萄牙、希腊和土耳其，而由于一九五三年九月美西之间协定的签订，西班牙事实上已被从后门拉进了北大西洋集团。现在，由于巴黎协定的批准，军国主义化的西德已成为北大西洋集团的第十五个正式会员国。这就使得这个集团的侵略性大大加强，使欧洲战争的威胁日益加深。
    （三）一九五四年九月签订的所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”更具有露骨的殖民性质。参加这条约的，除了三个同美国订有军事援助协定的亚洲国家以外，都不是亚洲国家。这个军事同盟不但支持美国在远东以中华人民共和国为主要敌对目标的政策，而且还便利美国对其它亚洲国家的侵略。
    （四）在中、近东，美帝国主义采取一种迂回的办法，把中、近东国家单独地或成对地拉入它庇护下的各种战争联盟，如一九五四年的土巴协定、一九五五年二月的土伊军事条约，都是在美国摆布下缔结的。谁都明白，需要在这个地区建立军事集团的并不是中近东的国家，而正是美国侵略集团。它企图把这些联盟最后变成北大西洋集团的附属部分。
      （五）除此之外，还有其他一系列各种各样的军事条约，例如一九五一年签订的“美澳新安全条约”；一九五一年到一九五四年跟日本订的一系列条约；一九五三年的美李条约；一九五四年的美蒋条约等等，这些军事条约对于维持和平和安全的需要毫不相干，完全是出于侵略的“实力政策”、为了准备新战争的目的。
                ×××
    美国侵略集团拿建立一些国家反对另一些国家的军事集团的政策，来对抗苏联、中华人民共和国以及一切爱好和平国家以和平和安全为目的的和平共处（不问其社会政治制度如何）的政策。他们还制造种种虚妄的借口，迷惑舆论，以掩饰其侵略阴谋，便于进行军事集团的组织。他们披着联合国宪章的外衣，硬把他们蹂躏联合国宪章，制造侵略军事集团的行动说成是为了维护联合国宪章。他们用“防御”、“和平”、“自由”和“安全”等等字样来掩饰其侵略的实质。他们又大事宣传“共产主义威胁”的神话，硬说他们这些拼凑起来的军事集团的任务是防止“共产主义的威胁”。美国侵略集团为了掩饰其不可告人的侵略动机，不得不一贯地借助于虚伪的言辞。但是说谎者尽管无休止地说着谎言，无情的事实却早已揭穿了这些谎言，暴露了美国侵略集团狡猾的面目。
    首先，美国推行军事集团的政策，正是对联合国宪章粗暴的破坏。联合国宪章的基本精神是维护世界和平和安全，而美国拼凑的军事集团则只有加剧国际紧张局势，加深战争危机。美国侵略集团歪曲地利用联合国宪章第五十一条关于集体自卫权利的规定，这是骗不了谁的，因为人们都知道，联合国宪章第五十一条规定的自卫权利，只有在一国遭到武力攻击时才能行使。可是，美国组织北大西洋集团和东南亚集团等等，并没有任何受到武力攻击或武力攻击威胁的情况。事实证明美国只是拿北大西洋集团和马尼拉集团来作为进行“冷战”和侵略的工具，完全破坏了联合国宪章的精神。美国又曲解联合国宪章第八章关于区域协定和区域机构的规定，来作为拼凑军事集团的借口。但是北大西洋集团包括了两个半球的国家，东南亚集团的成员国分散在四大洲，而且没有这个区域中主要国家的参加，这算得什么区域性的协定或机构呢？
    不但如此，这些军事集团的组织者蹂躏联合国宪章的行动，还表现在攫夺了应该只能属于联合国大会安全理事会的职权。谁都知道只有安全理事会才有权决定侵略的状态或侵略威胁，但这些军事集团的组织者——美国，却无理地把这些最重要的职权攫夺到自己的手里，利用这个职权来使美国干涉他国内政成为合法化。
    其次，美国拼凑的军事集团和联盟都是排他性的，它不要真正为和平努力的国家参加，而一味集合能够为它的战争政策服务的国家。美国拒绝了苏联参加北大西洋公约，却急不及待地把西德拉进了北大西洋集团，就是明证。谁都知道，重新武装西德并把它拉入北大西洋集团，其结果只能是严重地威胁欧洲的和平与安全。
    第三，事实证明，大事宣传根本不存在的“共产主义的威胁”，是美国借以拼凑军事集团，扩大美国霸权的旗帜。这个陈旧的黑色旗帜是美国垄断资本家从希特勒那里窃取来的。历年以来，我们可以看到美国利用这面黑色旗帜组织军事集团，在资本主义世界各处进行政治、军事的扩张。在这面黑色旗帜的掩护下，它给拉丁美洲国家加上了镣铐，把它的北大西洋公约的伙伴缚在以西德为核心的美国战车上并且控制老牌的殖民国家，伙同它们镇压东南亚民族解放运动，……。
    第四，美国控制下的一切军事集团，都是不平等的联盟。美国当政人士假惺惺地说着什么“自由世界大家庭”“全欧大家庭”等等好听的言辞，只是为了掩饰它内部无法克服的矛盾。这些军事集团好比是任何垄断组织一样，完全按照“大股东”
  （美国）的意志办事。凡是被美国拉入军事集团的国家，它的内政就要横遭美国干涉；它的领土就直接或间接变成美国的军事基地；它的经济就受美元的控制。
    现代的国际关系历史证明：侵略性的军事集团的形成往往导向大规模的流血战争。第一次大战前有德奥同盟，后来发展成为德国、奥匈帝国和意大利的三国同盟；第二次世界大战前有“柏林—罗马轴心”，后来发展成为德、意、日三国反共公约。这些集团都成了挑起世界大战的工具。现在，美帝国主义者又在走威廉二世和希特勒的老路，正在用建立排他性军事集团的办法，妄图把世界拖向新的屠杀。
    但是，今天的国际形势是完全不同了。历史的经验使得人民记取了教训。他们认识到阻止任何排他性的军事集团乃是制止新的战争危险的必要条件。亚非二十九国在历史性的万隆会议中一致反对组织侵略性的军事集团；欧洲八国在华沙会议中不但采取了防止战争和加强安全的措施，并且号召所有欧洲国家（不问制度如何）建立欧洲集体安全体系。亚非会议和华沙会议以后，和平共处的思想已日益深入人心。越来越多的人们懂得，不同社会制度之间是能够和平共处的。日益广泛的公众关怀和平的思想，正在形成反对建立任何军事集团的有效斗争的基础。记取了历史教训的全世界人民，是有决心也有信心使他们的要求得以实现的。
