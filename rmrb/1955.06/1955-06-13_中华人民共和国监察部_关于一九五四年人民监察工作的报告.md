Report of the Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China on the Work of People's Supervision in 1954
(Report by Vice Minister Liu Jingfan at the Fourth National Supervision Work Conference on April 7, 1955)
(Approved by the Tenth Plenary Session of the State Council on May 31, 1955)

In 1954, based on the work of the past few years, people's supervision organs at all levels studied the general task of the state during the transition period, summarized the supervision work of 1953, and convened the Third National Supervision Work Conference. According to the requirements of realizing the general task of the state during the transition period, this conference proposed to take the supervision and inspection of the implementation of various policies and laws and regulations of the state during the transition period and the implementation of the state construction plan, especially the economic construction plan, as the central task; and proposed to actively study the advanced experience of Soviet supervision work in combination with China's actual situation, and to promote the experience of supervision work of the China-Changchun Railway in a planned and step-by-step manner; it emphasized the use of the method of concentrating efforts on key inspections to further combat illegal and derelict behaviors in state administrative organs, enterprises and their staff. Over the past year, supervision organs at all levels have implemented the spirit of this conference, which has advanced and improved the supervision work and achieved great results.

(1) Conducted supervision and inspection with emphasis. Over the past year, people's supervision organs at all levels, in coordination with relevant business departments, have conducted multiple key inspections on unified purchase and sale, agricultural production mutual assistance and cooperation, flood prevention and drainage, and production disaster relief in rural areas. They exposed some cadres' irresponsible work or forced orders in the execution of tasks, as well as acts of corruption, theft, and violation of laws and discipline. These problems were inspected and dealt with, and suggestions were made to relevant departments to take measures to help them make corrections, which played a certain role in implementing the policy of increasing agricultural production, educating cadres, and improving rural work. At the same time, key inspections were conducted on the material supply work of more than 500 enterprise units in the financial and economic enterprise sectors, especially in the industrial and construction sectors, the warehousing and storage work of more than 23,000 grain warehouses and many commercial departments, and the financial management work of banks and other departments, and the following aspects were found:

In the inspection of material supply work, it was revealed that some enterprise departments only paid attention to completing tasks and did not pay attention to saving state property, unclear responsibilities, unsound systems, supply plans that did not conform to reality, generous budgeting and tight use, blind procurement, and wrong or repeated purchases, resulting in serious backlogs. According to the preliminary statistics of more than 300 supervision organs in the eight central industrial and construction departments in the second half of 1954, a total of more than 350 million yuan (calculated in new RMB, the same below) of raw materials were found to be backlogged. According to reports from supervision organs in various provinces and cities, the phenomenon of material backlog in local state-owned enterprise departments is also very serious. According to reports from the supervision committees of Liaoning, Hunan, and Tianjin alone, commercial departments had a backlog of more than 81 million yuan of commodities. Due to material backlog, poor storage, and improper use, serious losses and waste were caused. For example, preliminary statistics from 94 enterprise unit supervision offices under the construction, fuel industry, and first machinery industry departments showed that waste and losses amounted to more than 10 million yuan. Statistics from 25 enterprise supervision offices under the heavy industry and textile industry departments revealed materials outside the books and black warehouse materials worth 2.86 million yuan.

In the inspection of grain and commodity warehousing and storage work, it was also revealed that due to poor storage, chaotic systems, and disregard for warehouse safety, serious losses of grain and commodities occurred. According to incomplete statistics from the inspection reports of 27 provinces and cities, including Shanxi, Henan, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, in 1954, a total of more than 466.6 million catties of grain were found to be infested with insects, sprouted, moldy, rotten, burned, embezzled, stolen, and damaged by birds and mice. According to statistics from the Supervision Office of the Ministry of Commerce based on inspection materials from ten provinces and cities, commodity spoilage losses amounted to more than 7 million yuan.

In the inspection of financial management work, it was revealed that failure to pay attention to financial management, chaotic cash management, unclear accounts, and lax systems caused serious backlogs, waste, and embezzlement of state funds. According to the inspection by the Supervision Office of the People's Bank of China on 35 provincial and municipal branches and 160 affiliated units, it was found that there were false and unreasonable phenomena in non-business occupation of funds, resulting in a large amount of funds being backlogged. Due to undercollection of interest, compensation, fines, and teller shortages, 13 branches in Shanghai and five sub-branches affiliated to the Liaoning Provincial Branch suffered a total loss of 1.27 million yuan. According to incomplete statistics from the People's Bank of China, a total of 2,050 cases of embezzlement and theft occurred, with an embezzled and stolen amount of 400,500 yuan.

The above-mentioned problems, after inspection and exposure, aroused the vigilance of the inspected units, attached importance to material supply, warehousing and storage, and financial management work, promoted the competent departments to handle many backlogged properties and grains that were about to be damaged, saved losses, strengthened management work, and established and improved some systems. According to statistics from 44 units under the textile industry, the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and the heavy industry departments, after the supervision office reviewed the financial, material, and supply plans, it was recommended that the unrealistic parts of the plan be reduced by 10.98 million yuan and the necessary parts be increased by more than 139,000 yuan. The Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and its seven supervision offices promoted business departments to handle 2.9 million yuan of backlogged materials. According to the reports of 27 provinces and cities, including Hebei, Fujian, Henan, and Shanghai, a total of more than 3.69 billion catties of dangerous grain were saved.

(2) Promote the experience of supervision work of the China-Changchun Railway. In 1954, the experience of supervision work of the China-Changchun Railway has been widely promoted in various railway administrations of the Ministry of Railways, and was piloted in 24 enterprise units in the heavy industry, First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, textile industry, fuel industry, construction, transportation, commerce, and grain systems. Most of these units that promoted and piloted the work, with the active assistance of the higher-level supervision organs and competent departments, first went deep into the enterprises to understand the situation, learned while doing and accumulated experience, formulated rules and regulations, trained cadres, enriched the organization, and widely publicized the superiority of this experience. Then, they started one after another in the second half of 1954.

These promoting and piloting units adopted the method of "easy first and then difficult, learning while doing," starting with the inspection of financial work, focusing on the prior review of cash expenditures, contract signing, write-offs of consumption and obsolescence, and the formulation of production and financial plans for some units; at the same time, focusing on the follow-up inspection of the implementation of production and financial plans and the storage, statistics, and use of cash, commodities, and materials; individual units have already analyzed the production and financial final accounts reports. The units that promoted and piloted earlier have achieved preliminary results.

Since the units under the Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Railways promoted this experience, through prior review and follow-up inspection, they have uncovered losses, waste, unreasonable expenditures, and under-collection and missed collection of 7.3 million yuan, and over-budget and unplanned expenditures of 830,000 yuan. Revealed off-book materials, inflated materials, and black treasuries of 2,086,000 yuan. Through review and handling, they prevented and recovered losses of 2,530,000 yuan, and prevented over-budget and unplanned expenditures of 510,000 yuan. Among them, through prior review of various documents (including contracts), 14,800 documents were stopped from payment, with an amount of 2,640,000 yuan. Through follow-up inspections, more than 1,500 letters of recommendation were also issued, and enterprise management agencies took measures based on these recommendations, issuing more than 490 orders and instructions related to correcting shortcomings and improving work. For example, the Jilin Railway General Supervision conducted a prior review of the 1955 production and financial plan of the railway administration, and reduced unreasonable expenditures by more than 900,000 yuan. The Qiqihar Railway Administration established a statistical analysis system for under-loaded trains based on the letter of recommendation, and the number of under-loaded trains issued in the third quarter decreased by one-third compared with the second quarter.

Other pilot units have also achieved certain results. For example, after the Tianjin Second Cotton Textile Factory's financial revenue and expenditure, technical measures, major repairs, and basic construction plans in 1955 were reviewed by the supervisory personnel, the working capital was reduced and unreasonable construction projects were cancelled, saving a total of 470,000 yuan. After implementing prior review of the write-off of material consumption in the Mudanjiang Department Store, a responsibility system was established, the sense of responsibility of the staff was generally strengthened, and the consumption rate was reduced by 75%.

The results of implementing this experience prove that: in terms of giving play to the role of supervision work, it has great advantages. Because it supervises and inspects the production and financial plans of enterprises, it grasps the key issues of enterprises; because its supervision method is to conduct prior and follow-up supervision and inspection, it makes the supervision work more rigorous and powerful; because it implements vertical leadership, it avoids the influence and restriction of business units and can actively and systematically carry out work. In terms of strengthening enterprise management work, it also has great advantages. The main manifestations are: it can effectively supervise enterprise departments to implement national policies and laws, correctly implement national plans, rationally use state assets, prevent losses and waste, strengthen the accuracy of enterprise plans, and improve the sense of responsibility and discipline of staff.

(3) Handling people's complaints and accusations and disciplinary work. Over the past year, the supervision organs have clarified the division of labor with relevant departments in handling people's letters, improved working methods, and improved work efficiency. According to incomplete statistics, people's supervision organs at all levels have independently investigated and dealt with and transferred to relevant departments for investigation and handling of more than 316,000 cases of various kinds. Those with minor errors were given criticism and education and corrected; those with serious errors were given appropriate punishment according to the circumstances of the error. Those who had corrected their errors and were subject to disciplinary action were reviewed and the disciplinary action was revoked. This has played a certain role in maintaining state discipline, educating cadres, and improving the sense of responsibility.

(4) Training cadres. The Ministry of Supervision and some enterprise department supervision offices, in order to promote the experience of supervision work of the China-Changchun Railway, have held special training classes to train some cadres. Many other supervision organs, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection on strengthening on-the-job cadre business learning, have formulated learning plans, carried out on-the-job cadre business learning, and held short-term training classes or business lectures on their own or entrusted other organs to do so, which has greatly helped in improving the business level of supervision cadres and promoting the experience of supervision work of the China-Changchun Railway.

However, in the work of 1954, supervision organs at all levels still have many shortcomings:

(1) The bureaucratic and red tape style in our work has not been conscientiously overcome. There is too little inspection of the work of lower-level supervision organs, and the situation is not well understood. Many problems in the work cannot be solved in time, and the division of labor between dual leadership is not clear, which increases the difficulties in the work of lower-level supervision organs. There is insufficient political and ideological leadership for supervision cadres. There is little systematic investigation and research on the situation of the supervised departments, and it is impossible to discover and help them solve the main problems existing in their work in a timely manner. Some people's complaints and accusations are not seriously and responsibly inspected and handled, and are transferred layer by layer, delayed and backlogged; many new experiences in the work cannot be systematically summarized; the problems found are not reported to the higher authorities in time; and they are not good at using the materials exposed in the inspection to carry out publicity and education work.

(2) Some supervisory personnel do not have a sufficient understanding of the purpose of supervision work. They do not understand that the purpose of supervision work is to help the supervised departments correct their shortcomings and avoid mistakes, so as to ensure the correct implementation of state policies and laws and ensure the completion or over-completion of plans. As a result, there are more or less subjective, one-sided, and formalistic tendencies in their work. Some only pay attention to formal supervision and inspection, and do not pay attention to practical results. The number of inspection work and the problems found are not small, but they do not pay attention to improving the quality of inspection. Some problems are not inspected deeply and thoroughly and are not handled well or are not handled thoroughly and in a timely manner, or even delayed and backlogged, and cannot be handled after the fact; some only pay attention to exposing problems, and do not pay attention to handling problems. Although some problems have been inspected and handled, they do not pay attention to reviewing the improvement situation. Some even fail to actively expose the shortcomings and mistakes of the business departments and sincerely help them correct them, but let them develop. This point of view is wrong. In promoting and piloting the experience of supervision work of the China-Changchun Railway, some do not recognize the integrity of this experience, but one-sidedly believe that this experience is mainly to check finances and block financial loopholes, and do not pay attention to understanding and checking production problems; others believe that prior review is the main form of this experience, and isolatedly review documents, relaxing follow-up inspections. In the prior review, they do not distinguish between primary and secondary; they use their forces equally, which affects the supervision and inspection of major issues.

(3) Some supervisory personnel lack vigilance against bad tendencies and turn a blind eye. Some supervisory personnel have unhealthy thoughts and care about personal gains and losses. Some have many concerns about exposing and dealing with the shortcomings and mistakes of responsible personnel, fearing retaliation, and dare not expose or deal with them. Some mistakenly believe that supervision work is offensive, and the exposure and criticism are not sharp, the handling of problems is not serious, they get by, and they are amiable. In addition, individual supervisory personnel do not criticize, expose, or deal with bad people and bad deeds, condone and tolerate them, or even shield them.

In addition, it must also be pointed out that supervision work covers a wide range, the business is complicated, many institutions are set up, each unit has few personnel, and the forces are scattered and cannot meet the needs of the work. In addition, cadres lack production and financial knowledge, which also increases many difficulties in our work. These shortcomings and difficulties must be corrected and overcome in the future.

    中华人民共和国监察部
    关于一九五四年人民监察工作的报告
    （一九五五年四月七日刘景范副部长在第四次全国监察工作会议上的报告）
    （一九五五年五月三十一日国务院全体会议第十次会议批准）
    一九五四年各级人民监察机关在过去几年工作的基础上，学习了国家过渡时期总任务，总结了一九五三年的监察工作，召开了第三次全国监察工作会议。这次会议根据实现国家过渡时期总任务的要求，提出了以监督检查国家过渡时期的各项政策法令的贯彻执行和国家建设计划，特别是经济建设计划的执行为中心任务；并提出结合我国实际情况积极地学习苏联监察工作的先进经验，有计划有步骤地推行中长铁路监察工作的经验；强调运用集中力量重点检查的方法，进一步地和国家行政机关、企业及其工作人员中的违法失职行为进行斗争。一年来各级监察机关贯彻了这次会议的精神，使监察工作向前发展和提高了一步，并获得了很大的成绩。
    （一）有重点地进行了监督与检查。一年来，各级监察机关在农村方面协同有关业务部门，对统购统销、农业生产互助合作、防汛排涝、生产救灾等项工作，进行了多次重点检查。揭发了一些干部工作不负责任或在执行任务强迫命令以及贪污盗窃、违法乱纪的行为。这些问题，经过检查与处理，并建议有关部门采取了措施，帮助他们进行了纠正，这对贯彻农业增产政策，教育干部，改进农村工作，起了一定的作用。同时，对财经企业部门特别是工业、建筑等部门的五百多个企业单位的物资供应工作，两万三千多个粮食仓库和许多商业部门的仓储保管工作，以及银行等部门的财务管理工作进行了重点检查，并发现以下几方面的情况。
    在检查物资供应工作中，揭发了一些企业部门由于只注意完成任务不注意节约国家资财，责任不清，制度不健全，供应计划不切合实际，宽打窄用，盲目采购，错购重购等所造成的严重积压现象。据一九五四年下半年中央工业、建筑等八个部门中的三百多个监察机关的初步统计，共揭发出积压的原材料三亿五千余万元（以新人民币计，下同）。据各省市监察机关报告，地方国营企业部门的物资积压现象也很严重。仅据辽宁、湖南、天津三个省市监委报告，商业部门积压商品八千一百余万元。由于物资积压、保管不善和使用不当，造成了严重的损失浪费。例如：建筑、燃料工业、第一机械工业等部门所属九十四个企业单位监察室的初步统计，浪费损失达一千余万元。重工业、纺织工业等部门所属二十五个企业监察室统计，共揭发账外材料和黑仓库物资价值二百八十六万元。
    在检查粮食和商品仓储保管工作中，也揭发了由于保管不善，制度混乱，忽视仓库安全造成的粮食、商品损失的严重现象。据山西、河南、浙江、上海等二十七个省市监委一九五四年检查报告不完全的统计，共发现粮食生虫、发芽、霉烂、烧毁、贪污、被盗、鸟鼠损耗四亿六千六百多万斤。据商业部监察室根据十个省、市检查材料统计，商品霉坏损失七百多万元。
    在检查财务管理工作中，揭发了不重视财务管理，现金管理混乱，账目不清，制度不严，造成积压、浪费和贪污盗窃国家资金的严重现象。据人民银行监察室对三十五个省、市分行及一百六十个所属单位的检查，发现非营业占款中虚假不合理现象，积压了大量资金。上海等十三个分行和辽宁省分行所属五个支行，由于少收利息、赔偿、罚款、出纳短款等差错事故，共损失一百二十七万元。人民银行不完全材料统计，共发生贪污盗窃案件二千零五十起，贪污被盗金额四十万五千元。
    上述问题，经过检查揭发，引起了被检查单位的警惕，重视了物资供应、仓储保管、财务管理工作，推动主管部门处理了许多积压的资财和将要损坏的粮食，挽救了损失，加强了管理工作，建立与健全了一些制度。据纺织工业、第二机械工业、重工业等部门所属四十四个单位统计，经监察室审核财务、材料、供应计划，建议削减了计划中不切合实际的部分达一千零九十八万元，增加了必要的部分十三万九千余元。建筑工程部东北建筑工程局七个监察室推动业务部门处理了积压物资二百九十万元。据河北、福建、河南、上海等二十七个省、市监察机关的报告统计，共挽救了危险粮三十六亿九千多万斤。
    （二）推行中长铁路监察工作经验。一九五四年已在铁道部各管理局普遍推广中长铁路监察工作经验，并在重工业、第一机械工业、第二机械工业、纺织工业、燃料工业、建筑、交通、商业、粮食等系统的二十四个企业单位内试行。这些推广和试行的单位，在上级监察机关和主管部门的积极协助下，多半是经过首先深入企业了解情况，边做边学积累经验并制定规章，训练干部，充实组织，广泛宣传这一经验的优越性等准备工作后，于一九五四年下半年先后开始的。
    这些推广和试行的单位，都采取“先易后难，边做边学”的办法，从检查财务工作入手，有重点地对现金的开支、合同的签订、耗损报废的注销以及对某些单位的生产财务计划的制定，进行了事先审核；同时，有重点地对生产财务计划的执行情况和现金、商品、材料等的保管、统计、使用，进行了事后检查；个别单位已作到了对生产财务决算报告的分析。推广和试行较早的单位已经收到了初步的成效。
    铁道部监察局所属单位自推广这一经验以来，通过事先审核与事后检查，共揭发损失、浪费、不合理开支及少收、漏收七百三十万元，无计划超计划支出八十三万元。揭发账外材料、物资浮多及黑金库二百零八万六千元。经过审核与处理，防止和挽回了损失二百五十三万元，防止超计划、无计划开支五十一万元。其中通过事先审核各项单据文件（包括合同），停止支付的单据有一万四千八百件，金额为二百六十四万元。通过事后检查还发出一千五百余件建议信，企业管理机关根据这些建议，采取了措施，发出有关纠正缺点改进工作的命令和指示四百九十余件。例如：吉林铁路总监察对该铁路管理局一九五五年的生产财务计划进行了事先审核，削减了不合理的支出九十余万元。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局根据建议信，建立了不满轴列车统计分析制度，第三季度发出不满轴列车比第二季度减少了三分之一。
    其他试办单位，同样也取得了一定的成效。例如：天津第二棉纺厂一九五五年财务收支、技术措施、大修理与基本建设计划，经监察人员审核后，削减了流动资金和取消不合理工程项目等，共节省了资金四十七万元。牡丹江百货商店对物品耗损注销实行事先审核以后，建立了责任制，工作人员责任心普遍加强，耗损率降低了百分之七十五。
    实行这一经验的结果证明：就发挥监察工作的作用方面来说，有很大的优点。由于它对企业的生产财务计划进行监督与检查，这就抓住了企业的关键问题；由于它在监察方法上是进行事先与事后的监督与检查，这就使监察工作更加严密有力；由于它实行垂直领导，这就避免了业务单位的影响和限制，能够主动地有计划地进行工作。就对加强企业管理工作方面来说，也有很大优点。主要的表现在：能够有力地监督企业部门贯彻国家政策法令，正确地执行国家计划，合理使用国家资财，防止损失浪费，加强企业计划的准确性，提高工作人员的责任心和纪律观念。
    （三）处理人民检举控告和惩戒工作。一年来，监察机关在处理人民来信工作上与有关部门进行了明确的分工，改进了工作方法，提高了工作效率。据不完全的材料统计，各级人民监察机关自行查处和交有关部门查处结案的各种案件三十一万六千余件。对错误较小的给以批评教育，予以纠正；对错误严重的，根据错误情节给予适当的处分。对已改正了错误的受处分人员经审理撤销处分。这对维护国家纪律，教育干部，提高责任心，起了一定的作用。
    （四）培养训练干部。监察部和一些企业部门监察室，为了推广中长铁路监察工作经验，举办了专门训练班，训练了一些干部。还有不少的监察机关，遵照中监委所发的加强在职干部业务学习的指示，制定了学习计划，开展了在职干部业务学习，并自己举办或委托别的机关代办了短期训练班或业务讲座，这对于监察干部业务水平的提高与中长铁路监察经验的推广上，有很大的帮助。
    但是在一九五四年的工作中，各级监察机关还存在着许多缺点：
    （一）在我们工作中的官僚主义和文牍主义作风还没有认真克服。对下级监察机关的工作，检查的少，情况了解不够，工作中的许多问题不能及时得到解决，双重领导的分工不明确，给下级监察机关增加了工作中的困难。对监察干部的政治思想领导不够。对被监督部门的情况很少进行有系统的调查研究，不能及时地发现和帮助他们解决工作中所存在的主要问题。对一些人民检举控告案件不认真负责的检查处理，层层照转，拖延积压；对工作中许多新的经验不能有系统地总结；对所发现的问题不及时向上级反映；不善于利用检查揭发的材料进行宣传教育工作。
    （二）有些监察人员对监察工作的目的认识不够，不了解监察工作的目的就是为了帮助被监督部门纠正缺点，避免错误，以保证国家政策、法令的正确执行，保证计划的完成或超额完成，因而在工作中产生了或多或少的主观片面和形式主义偏向。有的只注意形式上的监督检查，不注意实际效果。检查工作的次数和发现的问题不少，但不重视提高检查质量，有些问题检查的不深不透不好处理或处理的不彻底不及时，甚至拖延积压，时过境迁不能处理；有的只注意揭发问题，不注意处理问题，有些问题虽然作了检查与处理，但不注意复查改进情况，甚至有的对业务部门的缺点和错误，不积极地揭发和诚恳地帮助其改正，而是听任其发展，这种观点是错误的。在推广和试办中长铁路监察工作经验中，有的不认识这一经验的完整性，而片面地认为这一经验主要是检查财务，堵塞财务上的漏洞，不注意去了解和检查生产上的问题；还有的以为事先审核是这一经验的主要形式，而孤立地审核单据，放松了事后检查。在事先审核中，不分主次；平均使用力量，影响监督检查主要问题。
    （三）有些监察人员对不良倾向缺乏警惕，熟视无睹。有些监察人员思想不健康，计较个人得失。有的对负责人员的缺点错误的揭发处理，顾虑多端，怕打击报复，不敢揭发，不敢处理。有的错误地认为监察工作是得罪人的工作，揭发批评不尖锐，处理问题不严肃，得过且过，一团和气。另外，有个别监察人员对坏人坏事不批评、不揭发、不处理，姑息迁就，甚至于包庇。
    此外，还必须指出，监察工作面宽，业务复杂，机构设置的很多，每一单位人员很少，力量分散不能适应工作的需要，加之干部缺乏生产财务知识，也增加了我们工作中不少的困难，这些缺点和困难今后必须设法加以纠正和克服。（新华社）
