    Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries' Construction
    Significant Achievements of the Soviet Union in Utilizing Atomic Energy in Agriculture
    The Institute of Plant Physiology and Agricultural Chemistry of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences has increased crop yields by using radioactive isotopes of phosphorus, zinc, sulfur, calcium, etc., to irradiate seeds before sowing. Test results show that winter wheat yields can be increased by 3 to 5 quintals per hectare (15 mu), and sugar beets can be increased by 20 to 35 quintals per hectare. The sugar content of sugar beets can be increased by 0.7 to 1.2 percent. Isotopes also have a positive effect on corn and vegetables, without harming the nutritional value of the crops.
    The Institute of Botany of the Armenian Academy of Sciences used tracer atoms to study some valuable but short-lived forage crops. The study revealed that the rapid aging of some forage crops (such as clover and rye) is related to their vigorous development process and the close mutual influence between vegetative and floral branches. Therefore, the conclusion was drawn that the lifespan of such crops can be extended by adjusting the harvest period and mineral nutrition.
    The Institute of Agricultural Chemistry of the Armenian Academy of Sciences has mastered and used tracer atom methods to study rational fertilization methods for wheat, the effect of foliar fertilization on cotton and tomatoes, and the characteristics of applying phosphorus fertilizer to grapevines.
    Soviet Scientists Have Designed Many New Agricultural Machines
    Soviet scientists and engineers have designed a new set of machines for wasteland reclamation. This machine includes a shrub remover, a root collector, and a soil loosener. When the machine starts working, the horizontally mounted blade on the shrub remover quickly removes shrubs and small trees from the wasteland. Then, the root collector gathers the removed shrubs into a pile and digs out the tree roots it encounters, while also collecting large rocks. A large soil loosener then loosens the soil. The wasteland is transformed into loose and even soil. It can clear two and a half hectares of wasteland in one shift.
    A new type of mountain tractor has been successfully manufactured in the Soviet Union. This new tractor has a special device that ensures normal operation on slopes of up to 30 degrees.
    The self-propelled compound bucket ditch digger, equipped with a 54-horsepower engine, is one of the new machines used in the Soviet Union for irrigation projects. It is sturdy, lightweight, and flexible. Operated by only one person, it can excavate 140 cubic meters of soil per hour. It can work on very complex terrains. In addition to being used for irrigation projects, it can also be used to dig trenches for tap water pipes, gas pipes, sewer pipes, etc.
    The Progress of Water Conservancy and Irrigation Projects in South Pyongan Province, North Korea, is Very Rapid
    After the completion of the first phase of the water conservancy and irrigation project in South Pyongan Province, North Korea, the second phase (final phase) of the project is progressing rapidly.
    The second phase of the project consists of 1,550 facilities of various sizes, aiming to introduce water from the Taedong River into the Yeonpung Reservoir for irrigation. After the completion of the second phase of the project, another 15,000 jeongbo of farmland will be irrigated.
    The concrete foundation project for the Yeonpung Reservoir dam has been 95 percent completed, and the basic construction of various waterways is also nearing completion.
    The workers participating in the construction of the second phase of the project are working hard, determined to achieve the engineering goals for the end of August before August 14 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation.
    More Than 200 Townships in Four Provinces of North Vietnam Complete Land Reform
    The land reform movement has been completed in 235 townships in the four provinces of Vinh Phuc, Bac Giang, Phu Tho, and Son Tay in North Vietnam.
    According to preliminary reports, 100,9196 Vietnamese mu (1 Vietnamese mu equals 5 Chinese mu) of land have been confiscated, requisitioned, and purchased from feudal landlords and distributed to 96,537 landless and land-poor farmers. In addition, farmers also received nearly 8,000 head of livestock and more than 73,000 pieces of agricultural implements.
    Great Development in Romania's Agricultural Collectivization Undertaking
    Romania's agricultural collectivization undertaking has achieved further success. From the end of 1954 to the present, the number of collective farms and cooperative farms nationwide has increased from nearly 5,000 to 5,500. The number of households they include has increased from 318,000 to 350,000, and the cultivated land they own has increased from 1.1 million hectares (15 mu per hectare) to approximately 1.3 million hectares.
    The development of collective farms themselves is also remarkable. At present, the public property of collective farms nationwide has increased by 33.3 percent compared to 1953. Many collective farms in Bucharest, Arad, and Păuliș counties have become wealthy million-dollar collective farms.
    In terms of improving cultural living standards, collective farms in various places have established 2,000 cultural palaces, clubs, and other cultural facilities for farmers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联在农业方面利用原子能的显著成就
    乌克兰科学院植物生理学和农业化学研究所利用磷、锌、硫、钙等放射性同位素来照射播种前的种子，提高了农作物的产量。试验结果表明，冬麦的产量每公顷（十五市亩）可以增加三到五公担（每公担合二百市斤），甜菜每公顷可增加二十到三十五公担。甜菜的含糖量可以增加百分之零点七到一点二。同位素对于玉蜀黍、蔬菜也能发生良好的影响，并且丝毫不损害作物的营养价值。
    亚美尼亚科学院植物研究所利用示踪原子对一些很有价值但是生命短促的饲料作物进行了研究。研究结果得知有些饲料作物（如三叶草和黑麦）所以衰老得快是同它们的发育过程旺盛有关系，同营养枝和花枝之间的密切互助影响也有关系，因此得出结论：可以依靠调整收割期和矿质营养来延长这种作物的寿命。
    亚美尼亚科学院农业化学研究所已掌握了并且使用了示踪原子法来研究对小麦合理施肥的方法、研究对棉花和番茄施行根外追肥的效果以及对葡萄蔓施磷肥的特点。
    苏联科学家又设计了许多新式农业机器
    苏联科学家和工程师为荒地的清理工作设计了一套新机器。这种机器包括灌木铲除机、除根收集机、松土机几部分。机器开始工作时，灌木铲除机上横装的刀子轻快地铲除荒地上的灌木和小树。接着除根收集机把铲下的灌木集成一堆，并且挖掉它碰到的树根，同时把大石块也收集起来。大型松土机接着松土。荒地便变成了松匀的土壤。它在一班工作时间内能够清理两公顷半的荒地。
    一种新式的山地拖拉机已经在苏联制造成功。这种新式的拖拉机有一种特别的装置，能够保证在三十度的斜坡上正常工作。
    装有五十四匹马力的自动推进复式吊斗挖沟机，是苏联兴建灌溉工程用的新机器中的一种。它结实、轻便、灵活，只要一个人操作，每小时可以挖掘一百四十立方公尺的泥土。它能够在十分复杂的地形上进行工作。除了用它来兴建灌溉工程外，还可以用来为自来水管、煤气管、下水道管等挖掘沟渠。
    朝鲜平安南道水利灌溉工程进展很迅速
    朝鲜平安南道水利灌溉工程第一阶段完成之后，第二阶段（最后阶段）工程正在迅速进展。
    第二阶段工程共有一千五百五十个大小设施，要把大同江的水引进延丰贮水池，进行灌溉。第二阶段工程全部完工后，将再使一万五千町步的农田得到灌溉。
    延丰贮水池堤坝建筑的混凝土基础工程已经完成了百分之九十五，各种水道等的基本工程也已接近完成。
    参加第二阶段工程建设的工人们正在加紧工作，决心在八月十四日以前达到八月底的工程目标来庆祝“八·一五”解放十周年纪念日。
    北越四省二百多个乡完成土地改革
    土地改革运动已经在北越的永福、北江、富寿和山西四个省的二百三十五个乡完成。
    据初步报告，已经从封建地主手中没收、征收和征购了十万零九千一百九十六越亩（一越亩等于五华亩）的土地，分配给九万六千五百三十七户无地、少地的农民。此外，农民还得到将近八千头耕畜和七万三千多件农具。
    罗马尼亚农业集体化事业有很大发展
    罗马尼亚农业集体化的事业进一步取得了成就。从一九五四年年底到现在，全国集体农庄和共耕社的数目从将近五千个增加到五千五百个，它们所包括的农户从三十一万八千户增加到三十五万户，它们所拥有的耕地从一百一十万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）增加到约一百三十万公顷。
    集体农庄本身的发展也很显著。目前，全国集体农庄的公有财产比一九五三年增加了百分之三十三点三。布加勒斯特、阿拉德和培亚马勒等州的许多集体农庄已经变成富裕的百万集体农庄。
    在提高文化生活水平方面，各地集体农庄为农民们建立了两千个文化宫、俱乐部和其他一些文化设施。  （据新华社讯）
