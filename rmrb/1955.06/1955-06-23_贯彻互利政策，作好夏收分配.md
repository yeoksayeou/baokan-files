    Implement a Mutually Beneficial Policy and Do a Good Job in Summer Grain Distribution
    Zhong Xia
    The summer harvest has already begun, and members of agricultural producers' cooperatives are very concerned about the summer grain distribution issue, wondering if they will be at a disadvantage in the summer distribution. Therefore, how to specifically implement a mutually beneficial policy in the summer distribution has become an extremely important link in consolidating agricultural cooperatives at present.

    This year's summer grain distribution in agricultural cooperatives is a rather complex issue. This is because, even within the same region, newly established cooperatives since last winter and this spring have different situations: some have unified planting and unified distribution, some have members planting their own land which is then put into the cooperative for unified management and unified distribution, and some have whoever plants it harvests it; expanded old cooperatives have different situations within a single cooperative, such as old members planting collectively and new members planting their own land; and there are also many problems with the handling of wheat fields of a small number of households that have withdrawn from the cooperative. In addition, some newly established cooperatives have unsound financial accounting systems, which further increases the difficulty of distribution. If these specific situations are not considered, it will be difficult to do a good job in summer distribution, and it will damage the economic interests of some members, affecting the consolidation of the cooperative.

    At present, many regions have strengthened their leadership over summer grain distribution work, and have conducted detailed research from policy principles to specific methods; some regions with earlier harvest seasons have also gained preliminary experience in summer pre-distribution. However, there are still many rural workers who do not pay enough attention to the summer grain distribution work. They believe that summer distribution is only an "advance payment," and it doesn't matter if it's done well or poorly, thinking "if the wheat distribution isn't good, there's still the autumn harvest," and therefore they no longer pay attention to the ideological situation of the members and the specific problems in the distribution, especially the specific economic issues related to the unity of poor and middle peasants in the distribution.

    Although the summer grain distribution methods cannot be uniform due to the specific conditions of different regions and cooperatives, in terms of policy principles, it must be guaranteed to be conducive to unity, conducive to production, fair and reasonable, and must not be ignored because summer distribution is a pre-distribution advance payment. In the distribution ratio of wheat fields that are uniformly planted and distributed by the cooperative, the principle of "mainly based on labor, taking into account land" must be conscientiously implemented, so that members with more labor and less land, and those with more land and less labor can receive reasonable benefits. If the original distribution method is unreasonable, it should be changed through democratic discussion. It is necessary to reward labor and take care of the land. Practices such as excessively lowering the land benefit ratio or distributing equally according to population, which are detrimental to the interests of middle peasants, should be resolutely corrected. For members who plant their own land and put it into the cooperative for unified management and unified distribution, reasonable remuneration must be given for the processing investment, etc., before the wheat seedlings enter the cooperative, and one part of the members should not be disadvantaged in order to take care of another part of the members. Cooperatives that adopt the method of whoever plants the wheat field harvests it, the wheat field owner should also give the cooperative a reasonable price if the cooperative has processed and invested in the wheat field. The pre-retention of wheat field seeds for the coming year and the deduction of public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, etc., should be handled with caution in cooperatives with unified distribution of wheat fields. Fearing "too much deduction and too little distribution" is a more common ideological concern among members. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of collectivism for members, and on the other hand, the number of deductions must be very appropriate, and disaster-stricken areas should pay attention to taking care of the living difficulties of members first. For the summer requisition and summer purchase work, attention should also be paid to it during the distribution. Whether it is paid uniformly by the cooperative or by individual members, the policy should be earnestly explained to the members to dispel their ideological concerns. This is good for correctly solving the distribution problem and completing the requisition and purchase tasks.

    The summer grain distribution problem is a rather complex policy issue. If the summer grain distribution is handled well, it can consolidate the unity of the poor and middle peasants in the cooperative, and greatly improve the production enthusiasm of the vast number of members, especially the middle peasant members, which is very important for the consolidation of the cooperative. In the entire distribution process, attention must be paid to taking care of the economic interests of the poor and middle peasants, and strengthening political education for them. At the same time, attention should also be paid to arranging summer production in the distribution, and guiding the enthusiasm of the members to summer production, so that summer distribution can become the driving force of summer production. The practice of opposing and separating summer grain distribution work from summer production work is wrong.

    It must be noted that, no matter what method of distribution is adopted, attention should be paid to mobilizing members to discuss democratically and negotiate together, and administrative methods should not be used to carry out the distribution. In terms of organizational leadership, if necessary, consideration may be given to establishing temporary organizations such as pre-distribution committees through democratic means to assist the leading backbone of the cooperative in doing a good job in the liquidation of labor days and work accounts, as well as the clean-up of financial accounting work, and promptly formulate distribution plans and make various preparations. It must be fully estimated that many agricultural cooperative backbones still lack experience in such complex work, which further increases the responsibility of the higher-level leading organs. It is necessary to educate the leading backbone of the cooperative so that they understand both the policies and have specific methods, so that the degree of consolidation of the cooperative can be improved a step further through summer grain distribution, and the leadership ability of the cooperative backbone can also be improved a step further.

    贯彻互利政策，作好夏收分配
    仲夏
    夏收已经开始了，农业生产合作社的社员都非常关心夏收分配问题，考虑自己在夏收分配中会不会吃亏？因此，在夏收分配中如何具体贯彻互利政策，就成为当前巩固农业合作社的一个极为重要的环节。
    今年农业合作社的夏收分配是一个相当复杂的问题。这是因为即使在同一个地区，去冬今春新建立起来的社，有的是统一种植统一分配，有的是社员自种入社统一经营统一分配，有的是谁种谁收；扩大了的老社，一个社内即有老社员伙种新社员自种等不同情况；少数退社户的麦田处理，问题也很多。再加上某些新建社财务会计制度不健全，这就更增加了分配的困难。如果不考虑这些具体情况，夏收分配工作就会很难做好，就会使部分社员的经济利益受到损害，影响社的巩固。
    目前，不少地区已经加强了对夏收分配工作的领导，从政策原则到具体办法都进行了详细研究；有些收获季节较早的地区，夏季预分也已取得初步经验。但是，仍有不少农村工作人员对夏收分配工作不重视，他们认为夏季分配只是“借支预分”，作好作坏没啥关系，认为“麦分不好还有秋”，因而就不再注意社员的思想情况以及具体分配中的问题，特别是分配中有关贫、中农团结的具体经济问题。
    夏收分配虽然因地因社的具体情况不同，办法不能强求一致，但在政策原则上一定要保证做到有利团结，有利生产，公平合理，决不能因为夏收分配是预分借支而有所忽视。麦田由社统一种植统一分配的，在分配比例上，必须认真贯彻“以劳力为主，兼顾土地”的原则，要使劳力多地少，地多劳力少的社员都能得到合理分益。原订分配办法不合理的，应经民主讨论加以改变。要做到既能奖励劳动，又能照顾土地。对于某些过分压低土地分益比例或按人口平均分配等有损中农利益的作法，应切实加以纠正。社员自种入社由社统一经营统一分配的，对于麦苗入社前的加工投资等必须给以合理报酬，不应因照顾一部分社员而使另一部分社员吃亏。采取麦田谁种谁收办法的社，社内对麦田有加工和投资的，麦田主也应给社内以合理代价。麦田统一分配的社对来年麦田种籽的预留和公积金、公益金等的扣除，都应慎重处理。怕“扣多分少”是社员较为普遍的思想顾虑，因此，一方面要加强对社员进行集体主义的思想教育，另一方面确定扣除的数目必须十分恰当，受灾地区更应注意首先照顾社员的生活困难。对于夏征夏购工作，在分配时要同时加以注意，不论由社统一缴纳或由社员个人缴纳都应向社员认真交代政策，解除社员思想顾虑。这对于正确解决分配问题和完成征购任务都有好处。
    夏收分配问题是一个相当复杂的政策问题。夏收分配如果处理得好，可以巩固社内贫、中农的团结，可使广大社员特别是中农社员的生产积极性大大提高，这对社的巩固是十分重要的。在整个分配过程中必须同时注意照顾贫、中农的经济利益，加强对他们进行政治教育。同时在分配中还应注意安排夏季生产，把社员的热情引导到夏季生产中去，使夏收分配成为夏季生产的推动力量。那种把夏收分配工作同夏季生产工作对立、脱节的作法是错误的。
    必须注意，不论采取何种方式分配，都应注意发动社员民主讨论，共同协商，不能采取单纯行政方式去进行。在组织领导方面，必要时，可考虑通过民主方式建立预分委员会等临时组织，协助社内领导骨干作好劳动日、工账的清算以及财务会计工作的清理等，及时拟定分配方案，作好各种准备。必须充分估计到，许多农业合作社的骨干对于这样复杂的工作还缺乏经验，这就更加重了上级领导机关的责任。必须教育社内领导骨干，使之既懂得政策又有具体办法，要经过夏收分配使社的巩固程度提高一步，使社内骨干的领导能力也提高一步。
