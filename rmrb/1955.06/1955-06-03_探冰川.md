    Exploring Glaciers
    By Our Reporter Fu Dong

    In June 1954, a glacier cut off the Kangzang Highway near "Gu" (a place name). The glacier, like mud, rushed out of the mountain gully with overwhelming force, carrying stones the size of houses, roaring like dozens of heavy bombers circling overhead, shaking the area for miles around. The stones collided with each other, emitting flashes of sparks.

    The glaciers came frequently, every five or six hours. Cloudy days were a little better, but sunny or rainy days brought even more frequent occurrences. Before long, the main stream of the Pelung Zangbo River next to the highway was blocked, shifting it a considerable distance south.

    What to do? Engineer Qi Shuchun and the road-building comrades were worried, unable to come up with a prevention method. But goods had to be transported! They had no choice but to erect a suspension bridge with steel cables across the glacier surface, which was several tens of meters wide, and have people carry goods back and forth. This suspension bridge was twenty-four meters high. However, after just over a month, the mud and sand brought by the glacier filled the space below the bridge. Helpless, they built another bridge eighteen meters high in a higher location, but it was filled with mud and sand again in a few days.

    Some engineers suggested rerouting the highway to the south bank of the Pelung Zangbo River. Others suggested moving the highway to the mouth of the glacier gorge and building a higher bridge there.

    Would rerouting the road and building a bridge solve the problem? Engineer Qi Shuchun thought about this all day long. He couldn't sleep or eat well. He recalled the scenes of glacier collapses in 1950 and 1953. They were also very violent, especially the one at the end of September 1953, which instantly destroyed a large forest of three kilometers in size, and more than a hundred residents of Suo Waka were swept away. Afterwards, he went there and investigated in detail, thinking at the time that it would pass in a while, so he continued to build the road according to plan. Little did he know that the glacier would come again this year, and for more than two months.

      "Glaciers cause such great harm to the highway; no matter what, we should explore them and understand the situation. This is our responsibility." Qi Shuchun thought day and night: "Didn't I once propose to the organization to go to the most difficult places to test myself? Now that the difficulty has come, let the Party test me!" He made up his mind.

    He arranged his work and went to Comrade Rang Mingde, the political commissar of the construction headquarters, to tell him his wish.

    Rang Mingde considered it for a long time and said, "You are too old."

    But Qi Shuchun was determined to go. The organization finally agreed.

    The news of exploring the glacier spread like wildfire, and many people were worried about Qi Shuchun because they had heard that there were bandits in the mountains, many leopards and bears, and the mountains were steep. A Tibetan hunter had gone before and fallen to his death.

    However, Qi Shuchun had considered all these things. He felt that it was worth sacrificing his life for the Party and for the people. He didn't hesitate at all.

    He held a forum, explained the importance of exploring the glacier, and also made the dangers clear. Twenty or thirty young people listened and scrambled to go: "Engineer Qi is almost fifty years old and still so determined, what are we afraid of?" Qi Shuchun finally chose nine young men to go with him.

    On October 2nd, they set off after breakfast. Soon after leaving, they began to climb the mountain. The mountain was very high. Standing at the foot of the mountain and looking up, one couldn't see the top, only a gloomy, dark forest floor. It was very damp. At night, they spread a lot of branches on the ground, covered it with oilcloth, and it was still cold. They climbed and climbed in the forest until the afternoon of the next day before reaching the top.

    There were no trees on the top of the mountain. White snowflakes swirled in the air. Looking north from the top of the mountain, it was a vast expanse of silver sea. Qi Shuchun knew that there were three straight peaks soaring into the clouds above that mountain. These peaks were all around six thousand meters above sea level.

    Nothing could be seen. Only every half hour or so, a rumbling sound like thunder came from the opposite mountain, and he didn't know where the mountain was collapsing.

    Qi Shuchun looked down at the glacier's drainage area in the valley, which was only six kilometers long and three kilometers wide.

    Everyone divided up the work: Qi Shuchun, a surveyor, and a guard took the lead. The other comrades followed when called.

    The next day, at daybreak, Qi Shuchun and the others took a gun, some ropes, and knives, and set off.

    It was a sunny day. The morning sun shone on the opposite peak, emitting a dazzling light.

    They walked around the glacier's drainage area and began to follow the glacier's lower river channel.

    The channel was very deep, with extremely steep cliffs on both sides, plunging straight to the bottom of the channel, as high as seventy or eighty meters. Rolling waves rushed through the channel. There was no road at all, not even a stone indentation to step on. They pressed their bodies tightly against the rocks, using their hands to grab the cracks in the rocks, moving down little by little. From
  one rock to another, they had to stop and study for a long time each time to see which rock was closer and safer to move to.

    But the difficulty was not just that. In many places, there were no cracks in the rocks at all. They had no choice but to grab the rocks with their left hand and use a knife in their right hand to dig a stone indentation to step on. They moved down little by little. Several hours passed, but they still couldn't reach the bottom. Qi Shuchun felt his mouth was dry and his eyes were burning. He stopped and looked up, the mountain was so steep that it seemed like it was about to collapse. He shuddered and had some difficulty breathing.

    He quickly closed his eyes. After a while, he looked down again. Now everything below the river was clearer. The water flowed down from above, hitting the rocks in the middle of the river, stirring up splashes. As he watched, he suddenly felt his legs were weak, and his body felt like it was suspended in mid-air.

    The scene of Communist Party member Cui Ximing exploring the Nu River suddenly flashed through Qi Shuchun's mind. Didn't Cui Ximing also move down slowly like a gecko clinging to the rock face?

    They climbed tenaciously. Finally, they reached the bottom. Now they began to wade through the water. The water was very deep, and in some places, only their heads were exposed. The icy water rushed, making it difficult for him to stand steady, and he shivered with cold. But at this time, he felt that he was doing a most magnificent undertaking - creating happiness for the people. He gritted his teeth and waded in the icy water for more than three hours.

    The cliffs on both sides of the channel were getting closer and closer. Now, looking up from the mountain channel, only a narrow strip of sky remained. Ahead were three waterfalls of seven to ten meters, the water flowing down like thousands of horses galloping, deafening. They couldn't move forward any further.

    But, good, all the information had been grasped. They decided to turn back. But Qi Shuchun suddenly felt his legs were frozen and couldn't move.

    The two comrades traveling with him decided to carry him. But he refused no matter what. He felt that everyone had been walking for a whole day and was tired enough. He must not add to the burden of others. So he crawled in the water. Only in deep water would he ask to be carried for a section.

    After wading through the water, everyone began to climb back up the cliffs along the original route. At this time, Qi Shuchun felt like he was carrying a mountain on his back, but he didn't show any weakness. He climbed tenaciously for another full six hours.

    On the way back, they met four comrades. Everyone looked at the cracks in the glacier with a "plane table." The cracks were two hundred and fifty meters thick, as high as an eighty-story building!

    It was already dark, and the distant peaks were flashing with snow. Back at the camp, everyone was too tired to eat and only drank some ginger water. This trip was not in vain. They collected information about the glacier - the stones on the mountain had been broken by years of erosion by ice and snow. The earthquake in 1950 collapsed half of the mountain and crushed the glacier. In 1953, the weather was warm, and the ice on the mountain gradually melted. It was possible that the ice and the stones on the mountain cracked and smashed on the glacier, plus the pressure from the glacier collapse in 1950, plus the earthquake, it collapsed again. After the glacier collapsed in 1953, a gray alluvial layer of sand and stone appeared. This alluvial layer was eroded by rainwater for a long time, and the water content was saturated into mud, which turned into mud-like things and flowed out when it rained. When it was sunny, the ice melted and flowed out too.

    Qi Shuchun saw that the cracks in the glacier were very large, and there were broken places in the middle, so he deduced that the glacier might collapse again. In that case, it would be useless to build the highway on the south bank of the Pelung Zangbo River. The soil on the south bank was unstable, and at the same time, two large bridges had to be built to take the south road. Such bridges were difficult to build and not safe.

    The slopes of the mountain gullies and rivers are very steep; once out of the mountain gullies, the slopes are relatively flat and open, so he concluded that the mud and stones would gradually accumulate once out of the mountain gullies. In this way, building a higher suspension bridge at the mouth of the gorge would not help, and the glacier collapse could still break the bridge. The best way now is to take the original highway, build a temporary road and bridge, or maintain seasonal traffic.

    For five years, Qi Shuchun has traveled more than 16,000 li on the Kangzang Plateau, climbed more than 100 large mountains, and trekked through countless rivers and grasslands...

    Now he is busy measuring the highway from Lhasa to Xigaze again.

    When the reporter recently interviewed him at the National Highway Model Representative Conference, he said: "It's hard, of course, but when you see that your work brings so much joy to the Tibetan compatriots, when you think that the Kangzang Plateau will also be as prosperous as other parts of the motherland in the future, do you still feel hard?"

    探冰川
    本报记者　傅冬
    一九五四年六月，冰川把“鸪”（地名）附近的康藏公路冲断了。冰川像泥浆一样，排山倒海地从山沟里冲出，飘着房屋大的石头，轰隆隆直响，就好像几十架重轰炸机在头顶回旋，震得附近几里的地方都在动。石头互相撞击，发出闪闪的火花。
    冰川来得很勤，隔五、六个钟头就来一趟，阴天还好一点，碰上晴天或雨天，来的次数就更多。这样没有多久，就把公路旁的迫龙藏布江的主流堵得往南移了好大一截。
    怎么办呢？工程师齐树椿和修路的同志都发了愁，想不出个防治的办法。但东西不能不运啊！他们只好在这几十公尺宽的冰川面上用钢丝绳架了个吊桥，由人来回背东西。这个吊桥有二十四公尺高。可是只过了一个多月，冰川带来的泥沙就把桥下面填满了。没办法，他们又在地势高的地方架座十八公尺高的桥，同样没几天，就又塞满了泥沙。
    有的工程师建议改道，把公路线改到迫龙藏布江的南岸。也有人建议把公路移到冰川峡口，在那里搭一个更高的桥。
    改了道，架了桥，是不是就没问题了呢？工程师齐树椿整天想着这件事。他睡不好觉，也吃不下饭。他想起一九五○年和一九五三年冰川崩溃时的情景。那来势也很猛，特别是一九五三年九月底那一次，一下来把三公里大小的一个大树林打得光光的，索瓦卡的居民被冲走了一百多人。事后他到了那里，详细调查了一番，当时以为一阵子就会过去的，于是仍按计划修路。那晓得今年冰川又来了，而且拖了两个多月。
      “冰川对公路的危害这样大，无论如何应当去探一探，弄清情况。这是自己的责任。”齐树椿日夜想着：“我不是曾经向组织上提出要到最艰苦的地方去考验自己吗？现在困难来到了，就让党来考验自己吧！”他下了决心。
    他把工作安顿停当，就跑去找修建司令部的政治委员穰明德同志，讲了自己的心愿。
    穰明德考虑了很久说：“你年纪太大了。”
    可是齐树椿决心要去。组织上最后答应了。
    探冰川的消息风一样地传开了，很多人替齐树椿担心，因为都听说山里有土匪，豹子和熊很多，山势也险峻，以前有个藏族猎人去过，摔死了。
    但是，齐树椿把这一切事情都考虑到了。他觉得为了党，为了人民，牺牲了性命也值得。他一点没有犹豫。
    他召开了个座谈会，把探冰川的重要性讲了讲，同时也把危险性说清楚。有二、三十个年轻人听了争着要去：“齐工程师快五十岁了，还这样坚决，我们怕什么？”齐树椿最后选出九个小伙子一道去。
    十月二日，他们吃过早饭就出发了。一出门没多久就爬山。山很高，站在山脚下往上看，看不见顶，看到的只是一片阴森森的黑树林地非常湿，晚上在地上铺了很多树枝，上面铺了油布，睡上去还冷冰冰的。他们在树林里爬了又爬，直到第二天下午才爬到顶。
    山顶没有树。白皑皑的雪花在空中旋舞。从山顶向北边的山上望去，白茫茫一片银海。齐树椿知道那山的上面有三座笔直的高峰耸入云端。这些山峰都是拔海六千公尺上下。
    什么都看不见。只是隔半个钟头对面山上就传来一阵轰隆声，像打雷一样，不知哪儿山在塌。
    齐树椿低头看看山谷里的冰川的汇水面积，只有六公里长，三公里宽。
    大家分了分工：齐树椿和一位测工、一位警卫员打头阵。其他的同志听招呼前进。
    第二天天一亮，齐树椿他们拿了一支枪和一些绳子、刀子，就动身了。
    这是一个晴天。早晨的太阳照在对面的高峰上，发出夺目的光辉。
    他们绕冰川汇水面积走了一圈，就开始沿着冰川下河沟。
    沟很深，两边峭壁极陡，直插沟底，足有七、八十公尺高，翻滚的浪花从沟中奔驰而过。根本没有路，连踏一个脚尖的石凹都没有。他们把身子紧紧贴在石头上，用手扒住石缝一点一点地往下挪。从
  一块石头挪到另一块石头，每次他们都要停下来研究半天，看挪到那块石头上更近更安全。
    但困难不仅仅是这样。有许多地方连石缝都没有，他们只好左手抓住石头，右手拿刀子挖一个能踏脚尖的石凹，就这样一点一点往下挪。几个钟头过去了，还是下不到底。齐树椿觉得嘴里发干，眼睛直冒火星。他停下来向上看看，山陡得好像马上就要塌下来似的。他打了个寒噤，呼吸都有些困难了。
    他赶紧闭住眼睛。停一会，他又低下头去。现在河下面一切看得更清楚了。水从上面流下来，撞在河心的石头上，激起了水花。望着望着，他忽然觉得两腿发软，身子像悬在半空中。
    齐树椿脑子里忽然掠过共产党员崔锡明在怒江探险时的情景。崔锡明不也是这样像壁虎似地把身子贴在石壁上慢慢地往下挪动吗？
    他们顽强地爬着。终于下到了底。现在他们开始淌水了。水很深，有的地方，人走到里面只露出个头。冰水奔流着，冲得他站不稳脚，冻得他直打寒战。但这时他觉得自己是在干着一件最壮丽的事业——为人民创造幸福。他就这样，咬紧牙关在冰水里淌了三个多钟头。
    沟两旁的峭壁越靠越近，现在从山沟抬头望上去，天只剩了窄窄的一条。前面是三个七公尺到十公尺的瀑布，流下去的水像万马奔腾，震耳欲聋。他们再不能前进一步了。
    但是，好了，整个的资料都已经掌握到手里了。他们决定转回去。但是齐树椿忽然觉得两腿像冻住似的，不能动弹了。
    同行的两位同志决定背着他走。可是他说什么也不肯。他觉得大家走了这么一天，累得都够受的。他决不能给别人加累。于是他就在水里爬着走。只在水深的地方叫人背一截。
    淌过水，大家又开始沿着原路往峭壁上爬去。这时，齐树椿觉得身上就像背着座山似的重，但他一点没有示弱，他又坚韧地爬了整整六个钟头。
    归路上，他们碰见四个同志，大伙拿着“平板仪”看了一下冰川的裂纹，裂纹有二百五十公尺厚，和八十层楼一样高！
    天已黑尽了，远处的山峰上闪着雪光。回到营地，大伙累得吃不下饭，只喝了点姜水。这一趟没有白走，他们收集到了关于冰川的资料——原来山上的石头受冰雪多年的浸蚀，破碎了。一九五○年地震，塌了半个山，把冰川砸垮了。一九五三年天气暖和，山上的冰逐渐溶化，可能是冰和山上的石头裂开砸在冰川上，加上一九五○年冰川崩溃给的压力，再加上地震，就又崩溃了。一九五三年冰川崩溃以后出现了一个灰色的沙和石的冲积层。这个冲积层受到雨水长期的浸蚀，含水量饱和成泥，一下雨就变成泥浆一样的东西往外流。天晴，冰化了，也往外流。
    齐树椿看见冰川的裂纹很大，中间有破碎的地方，因此推断冰川还可能再崩溃。那样，就是把公路修在迫龙藏布江的南岸也没有用。南岸土质不稳定，同时走南路要修两座很大的桥，这样的桥既难修，也不保险。
    山沟河川的坡很陡；出了山沟，坡就比较平缓开阔，所以他断定泥和石头出了山沟一定逐渐淤积。这样，在峡口修上再高的吊桥也不顶事，冰川崩溃还是可能把桥打断。现在最好的法子，还是走原先的公路，修个便道便桥，或者维持季节通车。
    五年来，齐树椿就是这样在康藏高原上奔走了一万六千多里路，翻越了一百多座大山，跋涉了无数的河流和草地……
    现在他又忙着去测量从拉萨到日喀则的公路了。
    当记者最近在全国公路模范代表大会上访问他时，他这样说：“苦，当然有一点，可是当你看到自己的工作给藏胞带来了那么多的欢乐时，当你想到将来康藏高原也将像祖国其他地方一样繁荣兴盛时，你还会觉得苦吗？”
