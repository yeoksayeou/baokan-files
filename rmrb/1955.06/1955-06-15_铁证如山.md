    Ironclad Evidence
    Zhang Nanxian
    The third batch of materials concerning the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, published by the "People's Daily," completely exposes the true face of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary gang: they are a group of counter-revolutionary elements with close ties to imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. On this point, the evidence is ironclad, leaving no room for doubt, let alone for Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary elements to deny.
    Judging from the materials revealed by the "People's Daily," this group of fellows who call themselves "revolutionary writers" turns out to be people with ulterior motives. Hu Feng betrayed the revolution early on, engaging in anti-communist and anti-people activities. After returning to China from Japan, he contacted many Kuomintang secret service chiefs while pretending to be a revolutionary, hiding within the people, and engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. A Long was a tactics instructor at the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's Army University. Lü Yuan "worked" in the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" – the sinister and dark spy agency where the American and Chiang reactionaries trained and dispatched secret agents and directly carried out terrorist activities. They were already loyal running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. Therefore, they were "filled with optimism" about the counter-revolutionary civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek throughout the country, believing that the "confidence" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit leader "further encouraged" them. Therefore, they hated the people's revolutionary forces, regarding them as "pus" that "must be drained," thinking "since we've started, we must finish the job." After the national liberation, this group of counter-revolutionary elements constantly held secret meetings to discuss and formulate counter-revolutionary strategies and plans, and madly attacked the ruling party of the state – the Communist Party and the people. They tried every means to infiltrate the Communist Party, steal Party documents, inquire about Party affairs, and engage in various counter-revolutionary activities in collusion with each other, adopting two-faced deceptive tactics. They slandered the Party's literary and artistic policies and cultural policies, and hated the Party's criticism of bourgeois ideology and the promotion of Marxism-Leninism. They fanatically hated the people's democratic dictatorship and everything in the new society, dreaming of the "destruction" of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's revolutionary regime. They wanted to be enemies of the people's revolution to the very end.
    The fact that the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique deceived our people for so long before being exposed is a great lesson. As the "People's Daily" pointed out: "Many of our people are not vigilant enough against hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and many have simply lost their vigilance." "Now, the time has come to thoroughly clarify the faces of this group of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary black gang, and the Chinese people will no longer allow them to continue playing deceptive tricks!" We must strengthen the study of Marxism, heighten our vigilance, thoroughly crush the Hu Feng clique, and eliminate this group of counter-revolutionary elements from the ranks of the people! At the same time, we must resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements similar to the Hu Feng clique who are hidden in our people's ranks.
    We demand that the National People's Congress revoke Hu Feng's delegate qualifications, and request the Supreme People's Procuratorate to further investigate the political background of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and severely punish their counter-revolutionary crimes according to the law!

    铁证如山
    张难先
    “人民日报”公布的关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料，完全揭露出胡风这个反革命黑帮的真实面目：他们是同帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮有密切联系的一伙反革命分子。对这一点，铁证如山，不容任何人怀疑，更不容胡风反革命分子抵赖。
    从“人民日报”揭露的材料来看，胡风这群自称为“革命作家”的家伙原来是别有来历的人物。胡风早年就背叛革命，干着反共反人民的勾当。后来从日本回国后，就一方面同国民党的许多特务头子有联系，一方面却伪装革命，潜藏在人民内部，干着反革命的活动。阿垅是蒋介石匪帮的陆军大学的战术教官。绿原是在“中美合作所”——美蒋反动派训练和派遣特务并直接进行恐怖活动的阴森黑暗的特务机关“工作”。他们早就是蒋介石国民党的忠实走狗。因此，他们对蒋介石在全国范围内发动的反革命内战才“充满了乐观”，认为蒋介石匪首的“自信”，对他们“更为鼓舞”。因此，他们仇恨人民革命力量，把人民革命力量看做是“脓”，认为“总要排出”，“一不做，二不休”。当全国解放后，这一群反革命分子不断地秘密开会商议，制定反革命的策略和计划，向国家领导阶级的政党——共产党和人民猖狂进攻。他们千方百计地打入共产党内，窃取党内文件，探听党内情况，并采取两面派的欺骗手法，里应外合地从事各种反革命活动。他们诋毁党的文艺方针、文化政策，仇视党所发动的对于资产阶级思想的批判和关于马克思列宁主义的宣传。他们疯狂地仇恨人民民主专政和新社会的一切，梦想中国共产党和人民革命政权的“灭亡”。他们要同人民革命为敌到底。
    胡风反革命集团竟欺骗了我们人民这么久才被揭发出来，这是一个很大的教训。正像“人民日报”所指出的：“我们的很多人对于暗藏的反革命分子，警惕性是不高的，许多人简直丧失了警惕性。”“现在，已到了彻底弄清胡风这一批反革命黑帮的面目的时候了，中国人民再也不容许他们继续玩弄欺骗手段！”我们要加强马克思主义的学习，提高警惕，彻底粉碎胡风集团，把这批反革命分子从人民队伍中清除出去！同时也要把类似胡风集团的一切暗藏在我们人民队伍中的反革命分子坚决清除出去。
    我们要求全国人民代表大会撤销胡风的代表资格，要求最高人民检察院进一步清查胡风反革命集团的政治背景，并对他们的反革命罪行依法予以严惩！
