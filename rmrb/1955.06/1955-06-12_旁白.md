    Aside
    Soviet Union, Saslavsky
    In ancient times, playwrights used a technique called the aside, which is no longer common today. For example, a rogue wooing a wealthy widow might say:
      "How I love you! (Aside) I can't stand the sight of her!"
    This assumes that the aside is only heard by those it is intended for, while others pretend not to hear it.
    You won't find this kind of aside in modern plays. Because everyone thinks this technique is too naive and ridiculous. But, strangely enough, this technique has been resurrected in contemporary American diplomatic practice. It has been habitually used by some of America's leading decision-makers. A government spokesperson might say at a press conference:
    "What we need most is peace. (Aside) We must have war."
    The first sentence is addressed to the general public, while the second is addressed to the monopoly capitalists. The audible statement is meant to reassure people alarmed by obvious war preparations. The aside is meant to allay the capitalists' panic caused by the first statement.
    However, while many contemporary diplomats are indeed not very different from actors, international affairs are, after all, not a stage. Thus, a new but simple technique has emerged. The statement and the aside are delivered by different characters. For example, Dulles issues a grand declaration proclaiming a desire for peace, while the mouthpiece of big capital, "Business Week," provides the aside. The most recent example of a performance of this nature is this.
    Dulles declared at a press conference that the US government is pursuing a policy of peace and fully supports easing international tensions.
      "Business Week" (May 14, 21) immediately gave the capitalists an aside: Don't take him seriously, there's nothing to be alarmed about.
    The magazine even makes no secret of the fact that the slightest easing of international tensions frightens capitalists, because it could lead to a reduction in military spending and military orders, and the accompanying huge profits.
      While America's most authoritative diplomatic leader has publicly stated that his only concern is international peace, "Business Week" publicly tells arms manufacturers not to believe a word of it: "Military orders for the 1956 fiscal year will not be changed."
    Washington's voice resounds around the world: "We will support every step that opens up prospects for peace!"
    But "Business Week" whispers, covering its mouth: "The prospects do not worry the capitalists. They say: 'We don't believe it, we don't need to be alarmed.'"
    The aside is supposedly spoken in a very low voice, so that those from whom the truth is being concealed cannot hear it. But the words of "Business Week" do not only reach the ears of the audience it wants to tell, these words also fly around the world. The public is of course not so easily fooled as to take Washington's diplomatic statements as genuine.
  "Business Week's" diligent service has discredited the words of peace coming from the American capital.
    This faithful mouthpiece of big business has done Dulles a disservice. It confirms the fact, well-known at home and abroad, that American diplomatic statements are utterly insincere. It's a double game. In the newspapers, on radio and television networks, the general public is told about the desire for peace; while in the aside to big business, the real policy is stated directly: prepare for war.
    This double game is not as easy as actors imagine. It requires tightrope walking skills. Walking on a taut rope between peace assurances and war preparations is risky. That's why American foreign policy has suffered so many setbacks, and in the end it doesn't get much trust from anyone.
      "Business Week" tells the capitalists that they have no reason to worry, because the government is not seriously considering the issue of peace, and on the contrary, is striving to increase international tensions, so their generous profits will continue to roll in. Entrepreneurs trust their government, but they are still not very reassured. This unease is reflected in their magazine. It tells us that some entrepreneurs, upon hearing talk of easing international tensions, say: "I'll believe it when I see it. It's too early to think about the prospect of international peace now."
    This is what a representative of the Eastern Electric Company said, and the magazine uses him as an example of a business optimist.
    However, there are also those who are very worried about business, even pessimists. The magazine's report shows the unease of entrepreneurs in the far west of the United States, where the "new arms industry" is making huge profits. These gentlemen have already "foreseen thorns ahead" and are worried.
    Why? They trust Dulles completely. They understand him, and he understands them. But they fear that the State Department may be forced to revise its current policy. They fear that a new factor may appear on the American political horizon - the American people.
    Up to now, the American people have not been counted on in Washington's political ledger. Neither the banks nor the government departments take public opinion seriously. They think that some empty promises are enough to keep the people quiet. But it has proven impossible to isolate the American people from the world. Like people all over the world, they hate war. So, when the asides spoken to big business arouse the greatest indignation, the peace declarations to please the audience can no longer reassure people.
    The result is an undisguisable embarrassment. We can even find this embarrassment in the pages of "Business Week." It tries to reassure others, but it is uneasy itself.
    Of course, "Business Week" does not doubt the warmongering nature of Washington's policy, but the problem is that Washington itself cannot help but worry about the prospects of the arms industry. "Business Week" writes: "What Washington fears is that something that will disrupt this prospect is a sudden and violent upheaval in the psychology of the American people."
    Why have big businesses and their political agents begun to talk about the people in shock? It seems that they made a mistake: they thought that they could lull the people to sleep with some beautiful statements promoting peaceful intentions, but in fact, the people are showing signs of awakening.
    A prominent American general made it clear to "Business Week":
  "Americans may imagine, as in 1946, that peace will prevail from now on. When that happens, then not only will we all have to demobilize. We will be finished."
    It is this concern about the possibility of the strength of the American people appearing on the American political stage that makes the heads of war advocates swell. They feel strong pressure from public opinion at home and abroad. They are forced to use tactics, but this still leaves them at a loss. They are simply like dancing a St. Vitus' Dance. Statements made to the public and asides spoken to entrepreneurs are mixed into an unpleasant cacophony, which even annoys the State Department's faithful allies - the once adept Western European diplomats.

### 旁白

    旁白
    苏联　萨斯拉夫斯基
    古时候的戏剧家惯用一种手法——旁白，这种手法现在已经不通行了。举例说，一个无赖之徒向有钱的寡妇求爱，他会说：
      “我是多么地爱你啊。（旁白）我简直看见她就讨厌！”
    这是假设旁白只能为那些要他们听的人所听到，而旁的人则装作没有听见的。
    你在现代戏剧中已经找不到这种旁白了。因为大家都认为这种手法未免太天真可笑。但是，奇怪得很，这种手法却在当今美国的外交实践中起死回生。它已为美国一些首要的决策人所惯于施用。一个政府发言人可能在记者招待会上说：
    “我们最需要的是和平。（旁白）我们必须有战争。”
    第一句话是向一般公众讲的，而第二句话则是讲给垄断资本家听。那句清晰可闻的话是为了要使被明显的备战活动所震惊了的人民安心的。而旁白则是用来消除资本家们由于第一句道白而引起的恐慌。
    然而，虽然许多当今的外交家的确和演员没有太大的区别；国际事务毕竟不是舞台。于是一种新的然而简单的技艺问世了。道白和旁白由不同的角色来担任。比方说，杜勒斯发表一篇堂堂皇皇的声明宣扬和平愿望，而大资本家的喉舌“商业周刊”来作旁白。这就是这种性质的演出的最近例子。
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上宣称，美国政府正在遵循一种和平政策，并且完全赞成缓和国际紧张局势。
      “商业周刊”（五月十四日、二十一日）就立即向资本家说了一句旁白：不必认真地去听他，没有什么可惊慌的。
    这家杂志甚至毫不掩饰，国际紧张局势的一丝缓和都是使资本家心惊胆跳的，因为它就可能导致军事开支的缩减，以及军事订货和与之俱来的丰厚利润的减少。
      美国最权威的外交领袖才公开说过他唯一关心的就是国际和平，而“商业周刊”就公开向军火制造商说，一个字也不用信他的：“一九五六财政年度的军事订货不会有所更动”。
    华盛顿的声音响彻全世界：“我们将支持打开和平前景的每一个步骤！”
    但是，“商业周刊”捂着嘴私语道：“前景并不使资本家们担心。他们说：‘我们是不相信的，我们无须乎惶然。’”
    旁白是假定用极低的声调说的，目的是要使对他们隐瞒真相的人听不到。但是“商业周刊”的话并不仅仅到达它所要告诉的听众的耳朵，这些话同样飞遍全世界。公众当然不可能易于受骗到这种程度，以致把华盛顿的外交声明当作是真货色的。
  “商业周刊”的殷勤的效劳，使得从美国首都传出来的和平言辞信誉扫地了。
    这家大企业的忠实的喉舌给杜勒斯干了一件不好的事情。它肯定了在美国国内外众所周知的事实，即美国的外交声明是绝无诚意的。这是一种两面把戏。在报章上，从无线电和电视网中，对一般公众大谈和平愿望；而在对大企业的旁白中，则直说真实的政策：准备战争。
    这种两面把戏并不是像演员们所想像的那样容易的。这需要施展走绳索的绝技。在一条介乎太平保证和战争准备之间的拉紧了的绳索上行走是要冒着滑跌的危险的。这就是为什么美国的对外政策会遭到这么多的挫折，而到最后它得不到任何人多大的信任了。
      “商业周刊”告诉资本家们说，他们没有担心的理由，因为政府并不是认真考虑和平问题的，而相反，是在力求加剧国际紧张局势，所以他们的优厚的利润会继续滚滚而来。企业家们是信任他们的政府的，但是他们到底不太安心。这种不安的情绪反映在他们的杂志上。它告诉我们说，有些企业家在听到谈及国际紧张局势的缓和时说：“我看到才会相信。现在去想国际和平的前景未免太早了。”
    这是东方电气公司的一个代表讲的话，而这家杂志是以他作为一个商业的乐天派来示范的。
    但是，也有对商业忧虑重重，甚至是悲观者。这家杂志的报道表明了美国极西部的企业家的不安情绪，那里的“新军火工业”正在获得巨大的利润。这些老爷们已经“预见到前途荆棘”而忧心忡忡了。
    为什么呢？他们对杜勒斯是充分地信任的。他们理解他，他也理解他们。但是他们怕国务院可能会被迫修改它的现行政策。他们怕在美国政治的地平线上出现新的因素——美国人民。
    迄今为止，在华盛顿的政治帐本上是不把美国人民作数的。不论是银行和政府各部门对于公众舆论都不当一回事。它们以为，只要用一些空洞的诺言就足以使人民安安静静。但是事实证明是不能够把美国人民与世隔绝的。和全世界人民一样，他们憎恶战争。所以，当那些说给大企业听的旁白激起人们最大的愤慨时，讨好观众的和平宣言就不再能安定人心了。
    结果是无法掩盖的狼狈。我们甚至在“商业周刊”的篇页中也可以发现这种狼狈的情景。它力图叫别人安心，而自己却惶惶不安。
    当然，“商业周刊”并不怀疑华盛顿政策的好战性质，但问题是，华盛顿本身也不能不为军火企业的前景而担忧。“商业周刊”写道：“华盛顿害怕，会打乱这种前景的事情就是美国人民在心理上的一次突然而激烈的动荡。”
    为什么大企业和它们的政治代理人竟开始震惊地谈论起人民来了呢？看来是他们犯了错误：他们原以为用一些宣扬和平意愿的动听的声明就能够使人民睡大觉，但是事实上人民却显出了觉醒的标志。
    一位显赫的美国将军明白对“商业周刊”说：
  “美国人可能会像一九四六年那样设想，从此和平将保持下去。当这样的事情发生时，那么，我们不仅都要复员。我们将要完蛋。”
    正是这种对于美国人民的力量可能出现在美国政治舞台的顾虑使得战争拥护者的脑袋发胀。他们感到国内外公众的强大压力。他们被迫运用策略，但是这仍然使他们无所适从。他们简直就像是在跳圣维他舞。对公众所发表的声明和对企业家所说的旁白混合成了一片不入耳的杂音，这甚至使国务院的忠实的盟友——曾经是善施诈术的老手的西欧外交家们也感到恼怒了。（冯之丹译自苏联“新时代”  一九五五年第二十二期）
