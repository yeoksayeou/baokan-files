    Why Doesn't the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate Accept the Liu Zhiying Counter-Revolutionary Case?

    To the Editor:

    In early May, our organization submitted the case of counter-revolutionary element Liu Zhiying and bad elements Liang Xingcai and Tao Linxuan, who had infiltrated the organization to conspire and sabotage, to the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate for handling. However, the Procuratorate has been slow to accept the case.

    Is it because the case should not be handled by the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate? Absolutely not. Please consider the criminal facts of counter-revolutionary element Liu Zhiying and bad elements Liang Xingcai and Tao Linxuan.

    Bad element Liang Xingcai managed to get into the Film Script Creation Institute in May 1951 through personal connections, and successively obtained positions such as Deputy Director of the Secretary's Office and Head of the Administrative Section. Soon after arriving at the Institute, Liang organized a small clique to resist the Party and administrative leadership and attack those with upright work styles. At the same time, he had illicit relations with the counter-revolutionary element hidden in the organization, Liu Zhiying, who was a health worker, and systematically provided Liu Zhiying with state secrets (such as the unified purchase and sale of grain) and information about our organization's security work, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of all Party members and cadres. He consistently concealed his history, forged documents, and hid a Browning pistol, eighteen bullets, and thirty Mauser pistol bullets, and failed to confess for a long time.

    Bad element Tao Linxuan is a Party dropout with serious political suspicions. His main crimes are: (1) having illicit relations with Liu Zhiying, a counter-revolutionary element and married woman who was a health worker hidden within the organization, and enticing backward elements, behaving despicably; (2) stealing and leaking state secrets, opening Zhao Zengxiang's drawer late at night to steal and read Zhao's notes and draft reports, and shielding the counter-revolutionary element Liu Zhiying; (3) killing a fetus and mistreating his wife and children; and (4) sowing discord, using public office for private gain, directing their small clique, and doing their utmost to create dissatisfaction with the Party and the leadership among the masses.

    Liu Zhiying, a counter-revolutionary element hidden in our organization, is an element who defected to the enemy in 1945. In 1946, Liu joined the action team of the Investigation and Statistics Office of the Baoding branch of the Kuomintang secret service organization, the Central Statistics Bureau, serving as a direct intelligence officer. In 1948, Liu fled to Beijing, had relations with secret service chiefs Wang Tiezheng and Fu Jian, and was introduced by Wang Tiezheng to the Fengtai puppet army hospital to carry out counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of a nurse. In October 1951, Liu forged her history and changed her name, infiltrating the health worker training class of the Third Clinic of the Ministry of Health. After graduating, she was assigned to work at the Creation Institute. After arriving at the Creation Institute, she used her sexuality to lure bad elements Liang Xingcai and Tao Linxuan to inquire about the activities of our Party organization and the major measures of state organs, and conspired with Tao Linxuan to murder a fetus, destroying Tao's marital relationship.

    Based on the above circumstances, we accepted the request of all staff members of the organization to not only purge Liang Xingcai, Tao Linxuan, Liu Zhiying, and others, but also filed a complaint with the state procuratorial and judicial organs in early May, demanding that they be dealt with according to law. Initially, we submitted a report to the Xidan District People's Court, where our organization is located, and the responsible comrade of our institute discussed the matter with Judge Yang of the Criminal Court in person. They believed that the case could not be directly handled by the court and that a complaint must first be filed with the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, which would investigate and initiate a public prosecution, and then the court would handle the case. When we went to the Municipal People's Procuratorate, Section Chief Hou, who received us, said that the case should be handled by the court or the public security organs, and the Procuratorate could not accept it. So we contacted the Xidan District Court again, and the Xidan District Court consulted the Beijing Municipal People's Court, which still insisted on its original opinion. We accepted the court's opinion and once again requested the Municipal People's Procuratorate to handle the case. After a few days, they replied that the case was very serious and complicated, and involved political issues, and must be investigated by the public security organs. If the public security organs wanted them to handle it, they would accept it. To this end, we also found the Ministry of Public Security. After they carefully verified all the case materials, they believed that the case should be submitted to the Procuratorate as a criminal offense. In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Public Security also sent a comrade to the Municipal Procuratorate with the person in charge of our organization to study the matter. Comrades Wang Huizhi and a Mr. Tian from the Procuratorate reluctantly accepted our complaint and all the materials. Unexpectedly, in less than two days, they pushed the case back, arguing that the problems were revealed during our internal review of cadres and did not constitute a crime; moreover, the Creation Institute was under the central government system and should be handled by the Supreme People's Procuratorate. At that time, we disagreed with this approach. They then argued that it would be best for you to handle it in the People's Court. In order to eliminate these bad elements as soon as possible, comrades from the Ministry of Public Security, the Film Bureau, and our organization went to consult with that comrade Tian from the Procuratorate. We repeatedly explained to him and criticized his "instructions" as unreasonable. Although he knew he was wrong, he still insisted on his original opinion, stating that there was no room for consideration. Moreover, when he learned that we were going to file a complaint with the higher procuratorial organs and the People's Daily, he said barbarously: "I'm not afraid of going anywhere. I just won't accept it!" He even attempted to tear up that "instruction."

    As a result, this case was delayed for a month without being dealt with in a timely manner (it has now been accepted by the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court). We feel that the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate should bear the main responsibility for this delay. As staff members of the state procuratorial organs, they should have a high degree of political vigilance. To treat cases of bad elements and counter-revolutionary elements who infiltrated state organs in the past as internal problems of the organization is nothing but a manifestation of a loss of revolutionary vigilance. We believe that the political numbness and irresponsible and bad work style shown by relevant personnel of the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate in dealing with this case have truly failed the trust and confidence of the people.

### 北京市人民检察院为什么不受理刘志英反革命案件

    北京市人民检察院为什么不受理刘志英反革命案件编辑同志：
    五月初，我们机关把反革命分子刘志英和坏分子梁兴才、陶霖轩等混进机关阴谋破坏的事件提请北京市人民检察院处理，而检察院却迟迟不受理这个案件。
    是不是因为这个案件不该由北京市人民检察院受理呢？完全不是。请看反革命分子刘志英、坏分子梁兴才、陶霖轩的犯罪事实。
    坏分子梁兴才于一九五一年五月通过私人关系混到电影剧本创作所，先后骗取了秘书室副主任、行政科长等职。梁到创作所不久，就组织小集团对抗党和行政领导，打击作风正派的人。同时和隐藏在机关中的反革命分子——保健员刘志英通奸，并有计划地把国家的机密（如粮食统购统销办法）和我们机关保卫工作情况、全体党员干部的优点、缺点、告诉刘志英。他一贯隐瞒历史，伪造证件；并隐藏白朗宁手枪一支、子弹十八颗、盒子枪弹三十颗，长期不作交代。
    坏分子陶霖轩是一个有严重政治嫌疑的脱党分子，他的主要罪行是：（一）和隐藏在机关内部的反革命分子、有夫之妇的保健员刘志英通奸，诱骗落后分子，行为卑污。（二）盗窃、泄漏国家机密，深夜打开赵增祥的抽屉偷阅赵的笔记和报告底稿，包庇反革命分子刘志英。（三）杀害胎儿，虐待妻、子。（四）挑拨离间，假公济私，指挥他们的小集团，极力在群众中制造对党对领导不满的情绪。
    隐藏在我们机关的反革命分子刘志英，是一个在一九四五年叛变投敌的分子。刘犯一九四六年参加国民党特务组织中统保定分局调查统计室行动队，担任直属情报员。一九四八年潜逃到北京，同特务头子王铁铮、特务傅建等发生关系，并由王铁铮介绍到丰台伪陆军医院在护士名义的掩护下进行反革命活动。一九五一年十月，刘犯伪造历史和改换名字，混入卫生部第三门诊部保健员训练班，毕业后分配到创作所工作。到创作所后，利用色情引诱坏分子梁兴才、陶霖轩探听我们党组织活动及国家机关重大措施等情况，并和陶霖轩共同谋杀胎儿，破坏陶的夫妇关系。
    根据以上情节，我们接受机关全体工作人员的请求，除将梁兴才、陶霖轩、刘志英等清洗出去以外，并于五月初向国家检察机关、司法机关提出控诉，要求依法处理。开始，我们向机关所在地的西单区人民法院提出报告，并由我所负责同志到法院和刑事庭杨庭长当面商谈。他们认为这件案子不能直接由法院处理，必须先向北京市人民检察院提出控诉，由检察院侦察后提起公诉，然后再由法院处理。我们到市人民检察院，接谈的侯科长说此案应由法院或公安机关处理，检察院不能受理。于是我们又和西单区法院联系，并由西单区法院请示了北京市人民法院，法院仍然坚持原来的意见。我们接受了法院的意见，又一次请求市人民检察院处理，过了几天，他们答复说此案问题很严重复杂，而且牵涉到政治问题，必须经过公安机关审理，如公安机关要他们办，他们才受理。为此，我们又找到公安部，经他们详细对证了全部案情材料，认为此案应作刑事罪提交检察院处理。为了解决这个问题，公安部还派了一个同志和我们机关的负责人一同到市检察院去研究，检察院王会之同志和一位姓田的同志才勉强接受了我们的控告书和全部材料。谁知不到两天，他们又把这件案件推出来，理由是：这是属于我们内部审查干部所揭露出来的问题，不能构成犯罪；而且创作所是中央机关系统，应由最高人民检察院处理。当时我们不同意这样做，他们又推说最好你们到人民法院去处理。为了早日清除这些坏分子，又由公安部、电影局和我们机关各派了一位同志，再去同检察院那位田同志商量，我们再三对他解说并批评他们的“批示”不合理，虽然他自知理屈，但还是坚持原来的意见，表示毫无考虑的余地。而且当他知道我们要向上级检察机关和人民日报提出控告时，竟横蛮地说：到什么地方也不怕，不受理就不受理，甚至企图把那张批示撕毁。
    这样，这件案子就拖了一个月没有得到及时处理（现在已由北京市中级人民法院受理）。我们觉得这事拖得这样久，北京市人民检察院应负主要责任。作为国家检察机关的工作人员，应有高度的政治警觉性，对于过去混进国家机关的坏分子和反革命分子的案件，还当做机关内部的问题来处理，难道这不是失去革命警惕性的表现吗？我们认为北京市人民检察院有关人员在对待这个案件上所表现出来的政治麻痹和不负责任的恶劣作风，实在辜负了人民的委托和信任。
