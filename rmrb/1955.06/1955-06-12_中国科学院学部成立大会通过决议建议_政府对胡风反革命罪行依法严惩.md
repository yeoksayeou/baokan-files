Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences General Assembly today passed a resolution suggesting that the government severely punish Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes according to law.

The resolution stated: The three batches of materials recently published continuously by the "People's Daily" and other materials have revealed the conspiracy activities of Hu Feng and his counter-revolutionary group with irrefutable evidence, confirming that Hu Feng and his group are extremely vicious and insidious class enemies of the Chinese people and the Chinese revolution. They wore the cloak of Marxism, hid in the revolutionary camp, and used despicable and malicious double-dealing political tactics to sabotage the Chinese revolution and the socialist cause of the Chinese people. It is clear that the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is not only a matter for the literary and art circles, but also for the people of the whole country and all our scientific workers. We absolutely cannot tolerate such incorrigible counter-revolutionary elements continuing to do evil, and we resolutely demand the complete smashing of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. To this end, we suggest that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress immediately revoke Hu Feng's qualification as a representative of the National People's Congress in accordance with the provisions of Article 38 of the Constitution; and suggest that the government severely punish Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes according to law.

The resolution stated: Exposing and smashing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is a great victory for the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. We must strive to draw experience and lessons from this struggle. With the development of the socialist construction cause, class enemies will inevitably carry out counter-revolutionary activities in a more insidious and cunning manner using double-dealing tactics. Therefore, we call on all scientific workers to redouble their political vigilance, work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, strengthen ideological transformation and ideological criticism, unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party, and resolutely struggle to expose and smash the Hu Feng group and all other hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and to build our great socialist motherland.

This newspaper reports: The four departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences - the Department of Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry, the Department of Biology and Earth Sciences, the Department of Technical Sciences, and the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences - held meetings on the morning of the 10th to discuss and criticize bourgeois idealist ideology, denounce the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, and demand severe punishment.

At the meetings, a total of sixty-six academicians from the four departments, including Zhu Kezhen, Wu Youxun, and Jian Bozan, spoke enthusiastically. Chen Wangdao, president of Fudan University, and Professor Su Buqing revealed that Jia Zhifang, a core member of Hu Feng, had been teaching at Fudan University, and his teaching work had always been irresponsible, but he was intent on carrying out "winning over" and "liaison" work among young teaching assistants and students. This Hu Feng element had monthly living expenses as high as 2,000 yuan, and some people suspected that he had other sources of income. Yang Shixian, vice president of Nankai University, revealed that two core members of the Hu Feng group, A Long and Lu Dian, had both lectured at Nankai University, and they spread various kinds of idealist literary and artistic ideas among the students. Wang Yanan, president of Xiamen University, said that Xiamen University had also discovered Hu Feng elements. Many natural scientists criticized their own lack of political sensitivity and their past lack of concern about the Hu Feng issue, and were shocked after seeing the three batches of materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. Chemist Huang Ziqing said that the political background of the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng should be thoroughly investigated and sentenced according to law. Chemical engineer Hou Debang said that the counter-revolutionary crimes of the reactionary Hu Shih were visible, while the counter-revolutionary face of Hu Feng was disguised, which was more vicious and terrifying. He said that today's exposure of this hidden counter-revolutionary group is a victory for the Party and the country. Many scientists proposed that in the future, they should raise their vigilance, work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, and thoroughly examine and criticize idealism in connection with the research work of each discipline, and eliminate the hidden counter-revolutionary elements in all scientific departments.

    中国科学院学部成立大会通过决议建议
    政府对胡风反革命罪行依法严惩
    新华社十日讯　中国科学院学部成立大会今日通过了一项决议，建议政府依法严惩胡风反革命罪行。
    决议说：“人民日报”最近连续公布的三批材料及其他方面的材料，已经以无可辩驳的证据揭发了胡风及其反革命集团的阴谋活动，证实了胡风及其集团是中国人民、中国革命极凶恶、极阴险的阶级敌人。他们披着马克思主义的外衣，暗藏在革命阵营内，以卑鄙恶毒的两面派的政治手段，破坏中国革命，破坏中国人民的社会主义事业。很明显，反对胡风反革命集团的斗争，不仅是文艺界的事情，而且是全国人民和我们全体科学工作者的事情。我们绝对不能容忍这种怙恶不悛的反革命分子继续为非作歹，我们坚决要求彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团。为此，我们建议全国人民代表大会常务委员会依据宪法第三十八条的规定立即撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表资格；建议政府对胡风反革命罪行依法严惩。
    决议说：揭露和粉碎胡风反革命集团，是中国人民革命斗争的巨大胜利。我们必须从这个斗争中努力吸取经验教训。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，阶级敌人必然更阴险、更狡猾地以两面派的手法进行反革命活动。因此，我们号召全体科学工作者必须百倍地提高政治警惕性，努力学习马克思列宁主义，加强思想改造和思想批判的工作，紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，为揭露和粉碎胡风集团及其他一切暗藏的反革命分子，为建设我们社会主义的伟大祖国而坚决斗争。
    本报讯　中国科学院物理学数学化学部、生物学地学部、技术科学部、哲学社会科学部四个学部十日上午分别召开会议，讨论和批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，声讨胡风反革命集团罪行，要求给以严厉惩办。
    在会议上，四个学部共有竺可桢、吴有训、翦伯赞等六十六位学部委员热烈发言。复旦大学校长陈望道、教授苏步青揭露胡风骨干分子贾植芳在复旦大学教书，教学工作一贯不负责任，却一意在青年助教和学生中进行“争取”、“联络”的工作。这个胡风分子每月生活费用高达二千元，有人就怀疑过他别有来源。南开大学副校长杨石先揭露了胡风集团的二个骨干分子阿垅和芦甸都曾经在南开大学讲过课，他们在学生中散布各种各样唯心主义的文艺思想。厦门大学校长王亚南说厦门大学也发现了胡风分子。许多自然科学家都批判了自己政治嗅觉不高、过去对胡风问题不够关心，看到胡风反革命集团先后三批材料以后才大吃一惊。化学家黄子卿说应彻底清查反革命分子胡风的政治背景，依法判罪。化学工程学家侯德榜说反动的胡适的反革命罪恶是看得见的，而胡风的反革命面目却伪装起来，这是更毒辣、更可怕的。他说今天能够把这个暗藏的反革命集团揭露，是党和国家的胜利。许多科学家提出今后要提高警惕，努力学习马克思列宁主义，结合每门科学研究工作深入地检查和批判唯心主义，并清除暗藏在所有科学部门中的反革命分子。
