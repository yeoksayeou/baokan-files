Hebei Solves Drinking Water Problems for People in Mountainous Areas

    In order to solve the problem of lack of drinking water for people in mountainous areas, Hebei Province has invested a total of 425,000 yuan this year to help people in 43 counties build more than 1,200 water pools, water cellars, water pipes, and wells. As of May 25, according to statistics from 35 counties, more than 140 water pools and wells have been completed. Most of the projects will be completed by the end of June. After all these projects are completed, the drinking water problem for more than 69,700 people and 27,100 large livestock can be solved.
    Most of the mountainous areas in Hebei Province are arid mountain ravines. Every spring, when there is a drought, the mountain ditches dry up and the groundwater level is deep, making it difficult to get water from wells. People in these areas have to travel three, five, or even more than 20 miles to fetch water for drinking. Since 1952, with the help of the People's Government, the drinking water problem for more than 250,000 people and more than 40,000 livestock has been solved. The drinking water problem for the remaining tens of thousands of people and tens of thousands of livestock is also planned to be basically solved within three years.

    河北解决山区人民饮水问题
    河北省为了解决山区人民缺乏饮用水的问题，今年共投资四十二万五千元，帮助四十三个县的人民修建水池、水窖、引水管、水井等一千二百多处。截至五月二十五日止，据三十五个县的统计，已完成了水池、水井等一百四十多处。到六月底大部工程可完工。这些工程全部完工后，可解决六万九千七百多口人和二万七千一百多头大牲畜的饮水问题。
    河北省的山区大部系干涸山壑，每到春季天旱时，山沟枯竭，地下水层又深，打井不易得水，这些地区的群众就须到三、五里，甚至二十多里以外的地方去取水饮用。从一九五二年以来，在人民政府帮助下，共已解决了二十五万多口人和四万多头牲口的饮水问题，其余还有十几万人口和几万头牲畜的饮水问题，也计划在三年内基本上求得解决。
