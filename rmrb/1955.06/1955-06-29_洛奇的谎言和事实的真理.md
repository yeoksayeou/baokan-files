Following Dulles' provocation against the Chinese people, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, Lodge, cursed China again in San Francisco on the 26th. He shouted the lies that the United States has said a thousand times, saying that China is not a peace-loving country, that China detains prisoners of war, and then, as usual, the conclusion: China should not be allowed to restore its legitimate status in that world organization.

These American masters are so nervous because they are increasingly losing control of the United Nations gate. Both inside and outside the United Nations, the call for restoring China's legitimate status in the United Nations is gathering into a magnificent wave. U.S. officials are very flustered. They want to close the door, they are nervous, and they threaten to launch a campaign against China's entry into the United Nations and to "extinguish" China's "influence."

However, liars, as usual, do not ask about the logic of facts. Since Lodge said that China is "not a peace-loving" country, then the United States itself seems to be a peace-loving country. However, the strange thing is that China, which is called "not peace-loving," has not sent a single soldier to U.S. territory, but the United States has invaded Taiwan, a Chinese territory 11,000 kilometers away from the U.S. border. China is willing to establish normal relations with all countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but the United States wants to attack China from "three fronts." Isn't it obvious who wants peace and who is aggressing?

Lodge falsely accused China of forcibly detaining prisoners of war in the Korean War. He was referring to a group of American spies captured by the Chinese people. But what else does Lodge have to say about these spies? Since the United States sent spies to China to make trouble, the Chinese people, of course, have to enforce their own country's laws to deal with these captured spies. As for the real prisoners of war, even if they voluntarily chose not to be repatriated and wanted to come to China, if some of them want to leave China, the Chinese people are prepared to send them out of the country. Now, people want to ask Lodge, where are the more than 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained by the United States at the time of the Korean armistice? People have not forgotten the report submitted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on this issue.

In order to ease the tension in the Far East, our country has repeatedly expressed its willingness to sit down and negotiate with the United States. Our sincerity is very clear to all countries and people who uphold justice. Therefore, the world, including some American bourgeois journalists, is becoming increasingly impatient with the evasive and closed-door attitude of the United States. The New York Post said that the United States is "fooling itself." But Lodge and his gang do not pay any attention to these things at all. The more the world wants to ease the situation, the more nervous the United States becomes. Dulles and Lodge launched a movement to "extinguish" China's "influence," and the United States is pursuing a six-point plan to occupy Taiwan for a long time.

No matter how Lodge and his like lie, the truth revealed by these facts is that the United States persists in aggression and refuses to ease the situation. The Asian people and peace-loving people all over the world have seen this very clearly.

Romulo, a confidant of the United States, said: "The United States has no prestige among many Asians and Africans."

    洛奇的谎言和事实的真理
    蒋元椿
    紧跟着杜勒斯向中国人民挑衅之后，美国驻联合国代表洛奇二十六日又在旧金山诅咒中国。他叫喊着美国已经讲了一千遍的谎话，说中国不是爱好和平的国家，说中国扣留战俘，然后，照例的结论：不许联合国恢复中国在那个世界组织中的合法地位。
    这些美国老爷们如此紧张，是因为他们越来越把不住联合国的大门了。在联合国内外，恢复中国在联合国的合法地位的呼声，正在汇成壮阔的浪潮。美国官员们慌乱得很，他们要关门，要紧张，他们扬言要展开一个反对中国进入联合国的运动，要“扑灭”中国的“影响”。
    可是，撒谎的人照例是不问事实的逻辑的。洛奇既然说中国不是爱好和平的国家，那末，美国自己似乎就是爱好和平的国家了。然而，奇怪的事情是：被称为“不是爱好和平”的中国并没有派一兵一卒到美国领土上去，反倒是美国侵占了离美国国境一万一千公里的中国领土台湾。中国愿意根据和平共处的五项原则，同一切国家建立正常关系，美国却要从“三条战线”上进攻中国。谁要和平，谁在侵略，不是很明显么？
    洛奇诬蔑中国强迫扣留了朝鲜战争中的战俘。他指的是被中国人民捕获的一批美国间谍。但是，关于这批间谍，洛奇还有什么好说的呢？美国既然派间谍来中国捣乱，中国人民当然要执行自己国家的法律处理这些落网的间谍。至于真正的战俘，即使是自愿不遣返要到中国来的，其中有人要离开中国，中国人民也准备送他们出境。现在，人们倒要问问洛奇，在朝鲜停战时被美国强迫扣留的四万八千多名朝中被俘人员现在都在哪里？人们并没有忘记中立国遣返委员会关于这个问题提出的报告。
    为了和缓远东紧张局势，我国已经多次表示愿意同美国坐下来谈判。我们的诚意所有主张正义的国家和人民都看得很清楚，因此，世人，包括美国一些资产阶级记者在内越来越对美国闪灼其辞、关门阖户的态度感到不耐烦。纽约邮报就说美国是“自己骗自己”。可是洛奇和他的一伙，却把这些完全不放在眼底。世人越要缓和，美国就越要紧张。杜勒斯和洛奇发动运动，想“扑灭”中国的“影响”，美国在搞六点计划，要长期侵占台湾。
    任凭洛奇他们怎样撒谎，这些事实所表明的真理是美国坚持侵略，不肯缓和局势。亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民已经把这一点看得非常清楚。
    美国的亲信人物罗慕洛说：“美国在许多亚洲人和非洲人当中是没有威信的。”
    这就是洛奇的谎言的注脚。
