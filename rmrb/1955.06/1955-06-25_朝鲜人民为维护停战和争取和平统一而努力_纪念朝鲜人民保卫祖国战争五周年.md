    The Korean People Strive to Maintain the Armistice and Strive for Peaceful Reunification
     -- Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Korean People's War to Defend the Fatherland
    Li Xiangchao, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese Side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission
    Lieutenant General of the Korean People's Army

    Since the liberation of Korea by the great Soviet army, the Korean people have taken all possible measures and made sincere efforts to establish a peaceful, unified, democratic, and independent state.

    However, the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang launched a sudden armed attack on the northern half of the Republic on June 25th, five years ago, provoking an unprecedentedly barbaric war in human history. According to a pre-determined plan, the U.S. imperialists deployed their land, sea, and air forces to the Korean battlefield, attempting to strangle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at once, and then to invade the People's Republic of China.

    The U.S. imperialists' calculation was completely wrong. All the people in the northern half of the Republic, who had become masters of their country, responded to the call of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic government, and the respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, and rose up unitedly to heroically participate in the sacred war against aggression, to defend the fatherland, and to defend peace.

    The Korean people's just war has won the active sympathy and assistance of fraternal countries headed by the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as peace-loving people all over the world. The Korean people, fighting side by side with the outstanding sons and daughters of the great Chinese people, the Chinese People's Volunteers, repelled the attacks of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and forced them to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    The Korean armistice, won with blood and flesh by the people of China and Korea, is a glorious victory for the people of China and Korea and a great victory for the forces of world peace.

    Since the armistice, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people have consistently and thoroughly abided by and maintained the Korean Armistice Agreement, and faithfully fulfilled the various obligations stipulated in the armistice agreement. At the same time, in order to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward fair and reasonable proposals and has taken a series of practical measures for peaceful contact between the people of North and South Korea. At the Geneva Conference, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward a plan for restoring the unification of the Korean state and holding free elections throughout Korea. This plan proposed holding general elections on the basis of the free expression of the will of all Korean residents to establish a unified Korean government, and to withdraw all foreign troops from the entire Korean territory within a time limit. This plan has won widespread sympathy from peace-loving people all over the world.

    Due to the sabotage activities of the U.S. government and the Syngman Rhee gang, the Geneva Conference failed to reach any agreement on the resolution of the Korean issue. Later, in October 1954, the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea adopted a letter of appeal to all workers, farmers, young students, entrepreneurs, merchants, religious figures, members of the National Assembly, civil servants, officers and soldiers of the National Defense Forces, and members of various political parties and social organizations in South Korea. The letter of appeal proposed holding a joint conference of representatives from political parties, social organizations, and all sectors of North and South Korea, or a joint meeting of the North and South Korean parliaments, in Pyongyang or Seoul to discuss the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    Following this, in order to create the possibility of rapprochement between North and South Korea, the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic issued a statement on November 17, 1954, protecting the personal safety of people traveling to and from the northern and southern regions of Korea, and guaranteeing their freedom of movement within the Republic. On November 22 of the same year, the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, in order to ensure the free movement of the Korean people for non-military purposes between North and South Korea, suggested that both sides of the Military Armistice Commission authorize them to pass through the demilitarized zone and the military demarcation line.

    In March 1955, the ninth session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward a series of proposals to promote peaceful reunification, once again emphasizing the need for North and South Korea to negotiate for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, convene an international conference, withdraw all foreign troops, and reduce the number of troops in North and South Korea to 100,000 each.

    This series of measures by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are concrete manifestations of its sincere efforts to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    At the same time, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic government, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the people of the northern half of the Republic rose up unitedly to fight for the restoration and development of the post-war people's economy. The implementation of the "Three-Year Plan for the Restoration and Development of the Post-War People's Economy" is the material basis for establishing a peaceful, unified, and independent motherland.

    With the selfless material and technical assistance of the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as the people's democratic countries, the Korean people, with their patriotic, selfless spirit and creative labor, overfulfilled the 1954 annual people's economic plan. In 1954, more than 120 enterprises, including the North Jung Machine Factory, were completely or almost completely restored; more than 40 modern enterprises, including the Heechon Machine Factory, were newly built; and the production of many machines and daily necessities that had been suspended during the war or could not be produced in the past began. In 1954, state-owned and cooperative industries overfulfilled the total production plan by 107.3 percent, with their output increasing 1.7 times compared to 1953, reaching the pre-war level of 1949.

    In agriculture, the cultivated area was also expanded, crop yields were increased, and many irrigation facilities were restored. In particular, agricultural cooperatives established in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation by farmers have greatly developed, and by the end of March 1955, the number of farm households participating in agricultural cooperatives accounted for 41 percent of all farm households.

    At the same time, many schools and houses, cinemas and hospitals have also been restored and newly built.

    With the rapid development of various sectors of the people's economy, the people's income in 1954 increased by more than 40 percent compared to 1953, and the people's material and cultural life has been significantly improved.

    As mentioned above, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic government, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have made consistent efforts to maintain the armistice and strive for peaceful reunification.

    However, the U.S. imperialist warmongers and the Syngman Rhee gang are unwilling to consolidate the Korean armistice and are unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

    The U.S. side violated the provisions of the armistice agreement regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war, forcibly detained tens of thousands of prisoners of war from the Korean-Chinese side, and used them as cannon fodder for the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs; and seriously violated the Korean Armistice Agreement by continuously dispatching armed agents to infiltrate the northern half of the Republic to carry out hostile acts; dispatching military aircraft to infiltrate our rear areas for reconnaissance activities; and illegally transporting war materials to expand the Syngman Rhee puppet army. The number of incidents of enemy aircraft violating the agreement alone, from the armistice to the end of March 1955, totaled 450 incidents, involving 964 sorties.

    The U.S. imperialist warmongers and the Syngman Rhee gang also concocted various conspiracies; planned to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that supervises the Korean armistice; and even openly clamored to tear up the Korean Armistice Agreement itself.

    The U.S. imperialist warmongers and the Syngman Rhee gang also clamored for "unification by force," violated the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops, signed a military treaty between the United States and the Syngman Rhee gang, and allowed the U.S. aggressor army to continue to occupy South Korea indefinitely, turning South Korea into a U.S. military base.

    At the Geneva Conference, the U.S. government and the Syngman Rhee gang rejected the legitimate proposals put forward by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but demanded that general elections be held under the supervision of the "United Nations," which had launched a war of aggression against Korea. They rejected the draft joint declaration by the countries participating in the Geneva Conference, proposed by the Soviet delegation, that they should undertake obligations not to take any actions that might threaten the cause of maintaining peace in Korea; and also rejected the sincere request by the delegation of the People's Republic of China that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference should continue to make efforts in the future to reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    The warmongering policy of splitting Korea pursued by the U.S. imperialist warmongers and the Syngman Rhee gang has completely destroyed the people's economy of South Korea, forcing the people of South Korea into a state of hunger and unemployment.

    The Syngman Rhee group, which is divorced from the people and completely isolated, is implementing a cruel fascist police rule in order to maintain its own "regime" and status. However, even in South Korea, which is under the mad terrorist rule of the Syngman Rhee group, the broad masses of the people warmly support the policy of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and are waging a tenacious struggle for its realization.

    The Korean people's struggle to maintain the Korean armistice and strive for peaceful reunification not only conforms to the interests and aspirations of the Korean people, but also fully conforms to the wishes and interests of peace-loving people all over the world. Therefore, this struggle of the Korean people is supported by peace-loving people all over the world. The struggle waged by the Korean people under this support will grow stronger and stronger, and will surely achieve final victory.

    朝鲜人民为维护停战和争取和平统一而努力
     ——纪念朝鲜人民保卫祖国战争五周年
    朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员
    朝鲜人民军中将  李相朝
    自从伟大的苏联军队解放朝鲜以后，朝鲜人民为了建立和平统一的民主独立国家，曾采取了一切可能的办法并真诚地进行了努力。
    但是，美帝国主义侵略者和李承晚匪帮，在五年前的六月二十五日向共和国北半部进行了突然的武装攻击，挑起了人类历史上空前野蛮的战争。美帝国主义者按照既定计划，将其陆海空军投入朝鲜战场，妄图一下扼杀朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并进而侵略中华人民共和国。
    美帝国主义者的盘算完全错了。成为国家主人的共和国北半部的全体人民，响应朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府及敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的号召，一致奋起，英勇地参加了反对侵略、保卫祖国、保卫和平的神圣战争。
    朝鲜人民的正义战争博得了以伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国为首的兄弟国家及全世界爱好和平人民的积极的同情和援助。朝鲜人民同伟大的中国人民的优秀儿女中国人民志愿军并肩作战，击退了美帝国主义侵略者的进攻，迫使他们签订了朝鲜停战协定。
    朝中两国人民以血肉取得的朝鲜停战，是朝中人民的光辉胜利，是世界和平力量的巨大胜利。
    停战以来，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民一贯地彻底遵守并维护了朝鲜停战协定，忠实地执行了停战协定所规定的各项义务。同时，为了争取祖国的和平统一，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国提出了公正合理的方案，并为南北朝鲜人民间的和平接触采取了一系列的实际措施。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上，曾提出了关于恢复朝鲜国家的统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举的方案。这个方案提议在全朝鲜居民自由表达意志的基础上，举行大选，建立朝鲜的统一政府，限期从全朝鲜地区撤退一切外国军队。这个方案得到全世界爱好和平人民的广泛同情。
    由于美国政府和李承晚匪帮的破坏行为，日内瓦会议对朝鲜问题的解决未能达成任何协议。后来，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议在一九五四年十月通过了致南朝鲜全体工人、农民、青年学生、企业家、商人、宗教人士、国会议员、公务员、国防军将士及各政党、社会团体的成员的号召书。号召书提议为协商祖国的和平统一问题，在平壤或汉城举行南北朝鲜的各政党、社会团体和各界代表的联席会议或南北国会的共同会议。
    在这之后，共和国内务相为造成南北朝鲜之间接近的可能性，在一九五四年十一月十七日发表声明：保护由南朝鲜来往于北朝鲜地区的人士的人身安全，并保障他们在共和国地区内的活动自由。同年十一月二十二日军事停战委员会朝中方面，为了保障朝鲜人民为非军事目的自由来往于南北朝鲜，建议军事停战委员会双方特许他们通过非军事区和军事分界线。
    一九五五年三月，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第九次会议提出一系列促进和平统一的方案，再一次强调：有必要为祖国的和平统一由南北朝鲜进行协商，并召开国际会议，撤退一切外国军队，将南北朝鲜军队的数目各缩减至十万人。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这一系列措施，是为争取和平统一祖国的真诚努力的具体表现。
    同时，共和国北半部人民在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成元帅的领导下，一致奋起为恢复与发展战后人民经济而进行斗争。医治战争创伤的“战后人民经济恢复与发展三年计划”的实现，就是建立和平、统一、独立的祖国的物质基础。
    朝鲜人民在伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国以及人民民主国家的无私的物质和技术援助下，以爱国的忘我精神和创造性劳动，超额完成了一九五四年度人民经济计划。在一九五四年，完全或几乎完全地修复了北中机器厂等一百二十多个企业；新建了熙川机器厂等四十多个现代化企业；并开始生产在战争时期曾经停止生产或过去完全不能生产的许多机器和生活必需品。一九五四年国营和合作社工业超额完成总生产计划的百分之一百零七点三，其产量增为一九五三年的一点七倍，达到战前一九四九年的水平。
    在农业方面，也扩大了耕地面积，增加了农作物产量，并恢复许多灌溉设备。尤其是按照农民自愿参加的原则所建立的农业合作社有了很大发展，到一九五五年三月底参加农业合作社的农户已占全部农户的百分之四十一。
    同时，还修复和新建了许多学校和房屋，影院和医院。
    随着人民经济各部门的迅速发展，一九五四年的人民收入比一九五三年增加百分之四十以上，人民的物质和文化生活有了显著的改善。
    如上所说，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成元帅的领导下，为维护停战和争取和平统一作了始终一贯的努力。
    但是美帝国主义好战分子和李承晚匪帮不愿意巩固朝鲜停战，不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题。
    美方破坏停战协定有关遣返战俘的规定，强迫扣留了数万朝中方面的战俘，使他们充当李承晚和蒋介石匪帮的炮灰；并严重违反朝鲜停战协定，不断派遣武装特务侵入共和国北半部，进行敌对行为；派遣军用飞机侵入我大后方进行侦察活动；非法运进作战物资，扩大李承晚伪军。仅仅敌机违反协定事件一项，自停战以来至一九五五年三月底，即共达四百五十起，九百六十四架次。
    美帝国主义好战分子和李承晚匪帮还布置各种阴谋；策划要破坏监督朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会；甚至于公开叫嚣要撕毁朝鲜停战协定本身。
    美帝国主义好战分子和李承晚匪帮并叫嚣要进行“武力统一”，违反朝鲜停战协定有关撤退一切外国军队的规定，签订美国和李承晚匪帮的军事条约，由美国侵略军无限期地继续占领南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成美国的军事基地。
    在日内瓦会议上，美国政府和李承晚匪帮拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团所提出的正当方案，却要求在对朝鲜进行侵略战争的“联合国”的监督下进行大选。他们拒绝了苏联代表团关于参加日内瓦会议的国家承担义务，不采取任何可能威胁维护朝鲜和平事业的行动的联合宣言草案；也拒绝了中华人民共和国代表团所提出的关于参加日内瓦会议的国家为就和平解决朝鲜问题达成协议，今后应继续努力的有诚意的要求。
    美帝国主义好战分子和李承晚匪帮奉行的分裂朝鲜的好战政策，完全破坏了南朝鲜的人民经济，迫使南朝鲜人民陷于饥饿和失业的境地。
    脱离人民、完全孤立的李承晚集团为了维持自己的“政权”和地位，正在施行残酷的法西斯警察统治制度。但是，即使在李承晚集团疯狂恐怖统治下的南朝鲜，广大人民群众，也热烈地支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和平统一祖国的政策，并为其实现而进行着顽强的斗争。
    朝鲜人民维护朝鲜停战，争取和平统一的斗争，不但符合于朝鲜人民的利益和愿望，而且完全符合于全世界爱好和平人民的愿望和利益。因此，朝鲜人民的这一斗争，受到全世界爱好和平人民的支持。朝鲜人民在这种支持下所进行的斗争，将日益壮大起来，一定会取得最后的胜利。
