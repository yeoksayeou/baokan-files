    Turpan: An Excellent Production Area for Long-staple Cotton
    Wang Binsheng
    The Turpan Basin lies between the Bogda Mountains and the Jueluo Tagh Mountains, encompassing the three counties of Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun. The basin is surrounded by high mountains ranging in altitude from one thousand to four thousand meters, while the basin floor is more than two hundred and eighty meters below sea level, making it the lowest and hottest place in China.
    In 1954, Soviet expert Titov studied the natural conditions of the Turpan Basin and concluded that the region's hot and dry climate, long growing season (with a frost-free period of about two hundred days), and availability of water for irrigation were suitable for the growth of long-staple cotton. Based on the expert's recommendation, the local government established a cotton experiment station in Turpan to conduct variety trials and small-scale pilot planting of long-staple cotton. The results of last year's pilot planting showed that the yield of long-staple cotton was equivalent to about 530 jin per mu. The experiment demonstrated that, under proper cultivation and rational management, the proportion of pre-frost cotton bolls could reach about 80%, an exceptionally high yield rarely seen in other provinces across the country.
    Due to the success of the 1954 pilot planting, Soviet experts suggested that a large quantity of long-staple cotton seeds be imported from the Soviet Union in 1955. 1,200 mu of long-staple cotton have been planted in Turpan, and these cotton seedlings now have five true leaves. People are working diligently to strengthen field management, preparing to apply advanced Soviet agricultural techniques to strive for a bumper harvest of long-staple cotton.
    In the near future, this famous grape-producing area of Turpan will be able to ship out large quantities of long-staple cotton, meeting the needs of various textile factories.

    长绒棉优良产地——吐鲁番
    王彬生
    吐鲁番盆地位于博格多山和觉罗塔格山之间，包括吐鲁番，鄯善，托克逊三县。盆地周围高山环列，高度在一千至四千公尺，盆底低于海面二百八十多公尺，是我国地势最低、气温最高的地方。
    一九五四年苏联专家提托夫研究了吐鲁番盆地的自然条件，认为这个地区气候炎热而干燥，生长季节较长（无霜期在二百天左右），有水可供灌溉，适合于长绒棉的生长。当地政府根据专家建议，便在吐鲁番成立棉作试验场，进行长绒棉的品种试验以及小面积的试种。去年的试种结果，长绒棉的产量折合每亩五百三十市斤左右。试验中证明，在适当栽培及合理管理的条件下，长绒棉的霜前花可以达到百分之八十左右，这样优越的产量是全国其他各省所少有的。
    由于一九五四年试种的成功，苏联专家建议一九五五年由苏联引入大量长绒棉的种子，在吐鲁番播种了长绒棉一千二百亩，现在这些棉苗已有五片真叶。人们正在辛勤地加强田间管理，准备运用苏联先进的农业技术，争取长绒棉的丰收。
    不久的将来，在这著名的葡萄产地吐鲁番，便可以运出大量的长绒棉，供应各纺织工厂的需要。
