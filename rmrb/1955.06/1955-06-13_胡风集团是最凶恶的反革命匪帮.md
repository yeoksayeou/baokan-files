    The Hu Feng Group is the Most Vicious Counter-Revolutionary Bandit Gang
    Hu Yuzhi
    Some time ago, some comrades raised the following question:
    "What exactly is Hu Feng?"
    After the "People's Daily" published the first and second batches of materials, this question should have been answered. However, some people are still unclear about this issue.
    Now it is good. After the "People's Daily" published the third batch of materials, this question should no longer be a problem.
    What is Hu Feng?
    He does not work in literature and art, nor does he engage in theory, and he is different from ordinary counter-revolutionaries.
    He is engaged in espionage. He is a spy. He is Chiang Kai-shek's spy, or an imperialist spy, or both.
    Now it is also clear: Hu Feng and his gang are neither a so-called literary and ideological sectarian group, nor a small number of individual careerists. It is a counter-revolutionary group, but it is not equal to a general counter-revolutionary group. It is the most vicious special agent bandit gang.
    This kind of special agent bandit gang is different from ordinary counter-revolutionary groups because its members are intellectuals and have ugly histories of betraying the Party and the people. It is hidden in the cultural work team, carrying out counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of revolution. It is not a special agent engaged in murder, arson, and poisoning, but the most vicious special agent organization that kills without bloodshed.
    Because of these characteristics, it is more brutal, more insidious, and more vicious than ordinary counter-revolutionary groups.
    Because of these characteristics, it can lurk within the people for a long time, blinding and deceiving many people, especially many intellectuals.
    As long as a Chinese person with good intentions sees the revealed materials, he will hate the Hu Feng bandit gang. However, it is not enough to just hate and be indignant. What is more important is to learn from the experience and lessons of this incident.
    Until recently, didn't some people think that the criticism of Hu Feng's thought was a bit excessive? Didn't some people think that this was just a sectarian dispute in the literary and art circles and not worth paying attention to? And there are many people outside the literary and art circles who hold the attitude of "it doesn't concern me, so I don't care."
    I do not doubt that the vast majority of people who have these views still have good intentions.
    The number of people participating in the Hu Feng group now seems to be quite large. Among this large number of people, there must be core members and peripheral members of the Hu Feng bandit gang, and it can be determined that there must be naive deceived members who are neither core nor peripheral. The number of these deceived members will not be small. Because if only a small number of people were deceived, it would be inconceivable that the Hu Feng group could carry out counter-revolutionary activities in secret for a long time without being exposed.
    What ability does the Hu Feng group have to deceive so many people? The materials published in the "People's Daily" have already explained: Those who have made mistakes in ideology and politics and are unwilling to resolutely correct them, those who hold a resolute liberalist stand, those who start from individualism and are dissatisfied with the Communist Party, and those who are arrogant and complacent, negligent, or only care about their work and forget politics, are easily trapped by the Hu Feng bandit gang.
    There is no doubt that among us intellectuals who are being transformed or have not been transformed, the number of people who possess one or another of the above-mentioned conditions will not be small. The whole secret of why the Hu Feng bandit gang can lurk within the people for a long time and play a huge role in harming the people and harming the revolution lies here, and the most worthy fact for us to be vigilant about is also here.
    There is no doubt that the exposure of the Hu Feng bandit gang's towering crimes of harming the revolution and harming the people is a great victory on the political front and a great victory in the struggle of the Chinese people against enemies at home and abroad. However, we must not assume that after the Hu Feng incident is exposed, the enemy has no way to use its tricks and everything is fine. In the period of China's transition to a socialist society, class struggle will only become increasingly sharp. Chinese intellectuals, especially comrades on the cultural front, can only fully learn from the Hu Feng incident, criticize bourgeois idealist thought, strengthen education on distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, and increase vigilance a hundredfold, so that we can consolidate the victories we have won and strive for greater victories on the political and ideological fronts.

    胡风集团是最凶恶的反革命匪帮
    胡愈之
    前些日子，有的同志曾经提出这样的一个问题：
    “胡风到底是算干什么的？”
    当“人民日报”发表了第一、二批材料之后，这问题本来应该已有了答复。可是有一些人对这个问题仍然闹不清。
    现在好了。“人民日报”发表了第三批材料以后，这个问题应该不再成为问题了。
    胡风是干什么的呢？
    他不是干文艺工作的，不是搞理论的，他也不同于一般的反革命分子。
    他是干特务工作的。他是特务。他是蒋介石的特务，或者是帝国主义的特务，或者两者都是。
    现在也弄明白了：胡风这一伙既不是所谓文艺思想上的宗派集团，也不是少数个人野心家集团。它是反革命集团，但又不等于一般的反革命集团。它是最凶恶的特务匪帮。
    这种特务匪帮所以和一般反革命集团不同，就是因为它的党羽是知识分子出身，而又都有过叛党反人民的丑恶历史的；它是隐藏在文化工作队伍中间挂着革命的幌子来干反革命的勾当的，它不是一般干杀人、放火、放毒这一类的特务，而是杀人不见血的最毒辣的特务组织。
    由于它有这些特点，所以它比一般反革命集团更加凶残，更加阴险，更加恶毒。
    由于它有这些特点，所以它能够长期潜伏在人民内部，使许多人，特别是许多知识分子受它的蒙蔽和欺骗。
    只要是一个有善良意志的中国人，看到了已经揭发的材料，对于胡风匪帮是不会不切齿痛恨的。但是单是痛恨和愤慨是不够的，更重要的是从这次事件的揭发，吸取事实的经验教训。
    直到最近为止，不是有一些人以为对胡风思想的批判未免过火吗？不是有人以为这只是文艺界的宗派纠纷，不值得重视吗？并且还有不少文艺界以外的人，抱着“事不关己，高高挂起”的态度。
    我并不怀疑，有这一些看法的人，其中极大部分，都还是抱有善良意志的。
    参加胡风集团的人数现在看来是不少的。在这不少的人数中，一定有胡风匪帮的骨干分子和外围分子，并且可以断定其中一定还有既非骨干又非外围而是天真的被骗分子。这些被骗分子的人数是不会很少的。因为假如只有很少的人被骗，胡风集团长期隐蔽进行反革命活动而没有被揭发，是不可设想的。
    胡风集团有什么本领使许多人受骗？“人民日报”发表的材料已经有了说明：思想上政治上曾经犯了错误而不愿坚决改正的，抱坚决的自由主义立场的，从个人主义出发，对共产党不满的，还有是骄傲自满，麻痹大意，或者顾了业务，忘记政治的，这一些人就很容易落入胡风匪帮的圈套。
    毫无疑问，在我们这些正在改造中或者未经过改造的知识分子中间，具备上列这一条或那一条的人们，不会是为数很少的。胡风匪帮所以能够长期潜伏在人民内部，起危害人民危害革命的巨大作用，整个秘密就在这里，而最值得我们警惕的事实也在这里。
    毫无疑义，胡风匪帮危害革命，危害人民的滔天罪行的揭发，是政治战线上一次极大的胜利，是我国人民反对内外敌人斗争中一次极大的胜利。但是决不能设想，胡风事件揭发以后，敌人已经无所施其技了，已经万事大吉了。在我国向社会主义社会过渡的时期中，阶级斗争只有越来越尖锐。中国知识分子特别是文化战线上的战友们，只有从胡风事件充分吸取教训，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，加强分清敌我的教育，更加百倍地提高警惕，我们才能巩固已得的胜利，并争取政治战线思想战线上更大的胜利。
