Xinhua News Agency, June 14th. TASS, Moscow, June 13th: TASS issued the following statement:

    U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Dulles recently made a statement to the press regarding the upcoming summit conference of the four governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. The statement insisted that the success of the meeting would depend primarily on whether the Soviet Union was willing to adopt a "new constructive spirit" in resolving international problems. Mr. Dulles attempted to cast doubt on the sincerity of the Soviet government regarding this meeting. Mr. Dulles also said in his talk that the United States intends to submit issues such as "the problem of Eastern European countries" and "international communist activities" for discussion at the meeting.

    Regarding this, Soviet authoritative figures expressed the following opinions:

    Mr. Dulles's talk is a continuation of the policy pursued in past statements by American leaders, a policy which was pointed out as unworkable in the Soviet government's note to the U.S. government on May 26, 1955. Mr. Dulles and some other American politicians, proceeding from the infamous "position of strength" policy viewpoint, treat the upcoming four-power summit conference and state that the success of the meeting depends primarily on the attitude of the Soviet Union. This shows that their efforts are not to promote the work of the meeting but to complicate the situation and create difficulties for the work of the meeting on the eve of the meeting. However, the success of any international conference depends on whether all participants of the meeting are sincere in promoting the resolution of outstanding issues while duly considering the interests of all participants of the meeting. The idea of presenting certain negotiating conditions to one party is absurd. In any case, it should not be forgotten that, as in the past, it is impossible to succeed by adopting such methods against the Soviet Union.

    The claim that the meeting should discuss issues such as "the problem of Eastern European countries" or "international communist activities" cannot have anything in common with the desire to achieve constructive results at the meeting. There is no "problem of Eastern European countries" because the people of these countries have overthrown the rule of the exploiters and established people's democratic regimes in their own countries, and they will never allow anyone to interfere in their internal affairs. This should be very clear to everyone.

    As for the question of "international communist activities," then please tell me: if someone raises the issue of, say, "international capitalist activities" at the Four-Power Conference, what attitude would Mr. Dulles take?

    All these arguments by Mr. Dulles cannot be viewed in any other way except as an attempt to divert public attention from truly pressing issues in international life, such as disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, the establishment of a European collective security system, guaranteeing peace and security in Asia and the Far East, and restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, etc. Is this not obvious?

    The new steps taken by the Soviet Union to ease international tension have had a profound impact on the international situation. These steps are: the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty, the Soviet government's proposal on reducing armaments, banning atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of a new war, the Soviet-Yugoslav talks that normalized and improved relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the proposal to establish diplomatic and trade relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Soviet-Japanese negotiations that have begun, etc. All of this is a huge contribution made by the Soviet Union in promoting mutual trust and consolidating peace between countries.

    In this situation, if the American leaders still consider it appropriate to emphasize that the United States does not intend to participate in the summit conference with any constructive proposals aimed at easing international tension, but expects the Soviet Union to make some "concessions," then this only shows that not everyone likes the easing of international tension that has begun due to the efforts of the Soviet government. On the contrary, some people hope to maintain this tension and further expand the arms race that is causing a heavy burden on the people of all countries.

    The Soviet government has repeatedly stated that it believes the task of the Four-Power Summit Conference is to ease international tension and promote trust between countries. If all relevant countries strive, not in words but in deeds, to achieve constructive results at the meeting, such results can be achieved.

    就杜勒斯对四国政府首脑会议问题的别有用心的谈话
    塔斯社发表声明引述苏联权威人士的评论
    新华社十四日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：塔斯社发表声明如下：
    美国国务卿杜勒斯先生最近就即将举行的苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑会议向报界发表了一篇谈话。谈话中硬说，会议成功与否首先将取决于苏联是不是愿意在解决国际问题方面采取“新的建设性的精神”。杜勒斯先生企图使人怀疑苏联政府对这次会议所抱的诚意。杜勒斯先生在他的谈话中还说，美国打算把“东欧国家问题”和“国际共产主义活动”这样一些问题提交会议讨论。
    关于这一点，苏联权威人士发表了如下的意见：
    杜勒斯先生的谈话是美国领导人物在过去的言论中所奉行的那种方针的继续，在一九五五年五月二十六日苏联政府给美国政府的照会中，已经指出这种方针是行不通的。杜勒斯先生和美国其他一些政治家，从臭名远扬的“实力地位”政策观点出发，来对待即将举行的四国政府首脑会议，并把事情说成是会议成功与否首先取决于苏联的态度，这就表明，他们的努力不是要促进会议的工作，而是要在会议前夕使局势复杂起来，给会议的工作制造困难。然而，任何一次国际会议能否成功，取决于会议的所有参加者是不是有诚意在适当考虑到会议全体参加者的利益的情况下促进悬而未决的问题的解决。向一方提出某些谈判条件的想法是荒诞的。无论如何都不应该忘记，像过去一样，对苏联采用这类手段是不可能得到成功的。
    所谓会议应该讨论“东欧国家问题”或是“国际共产主义活动”问题之类问题的说法，也不可能同想要使会议取得建设性结果的愿望有任何共同之处。并不存在任何“东欧国家问题”，因为这些国家的人民已经推翻了剥削者的统治，在自己国家中建立了人民民主政权，他们决不会容许任何人来干涉他们的内政。这一点对一切人来说，也应该是很清楚的。
    至于“国际共产主义活动”的问题，那末请问：如果有人在四国会议上提出譬如“国际资本主义活动”的问题，杜勒斯先生会采取什么态度呢？
    对杜勒斯先生的所有这些论调不能有其他看法，只能把这些论调看作是企图转移公众对国际生活中真正迫切的问题的注意，如像裁减军备和禁止原子武器、建立欧洲集体安全体系、保证亚洲和远东的和平和安全、恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利等等，这一点难道还不明显。
    苏联为了缓和国际紧张局势而采取的新步骤对国际局势发生了深刻的影响。这些步骤是：奥地利国家条约的缔结，苏联政府关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的建议，使苏联同南斯拉夫之间的关系正常化和得到改善的苏南两国会谈，关于在苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间建立外交和贸易关系的建议，已经开始的苏日谈判等等。所有这一切都是苏联在促进国与国之间的相互信任和巩固和平方面所作的巨大贡献。
    在这种情况下，如果美国的领导人物还认为宜于强调说明，美国不打算带着目的在于缓和国际紧张局势的任何建设性建议来参加政府首脑会议，而是期待苏联作出某种“让步”，那末，这只是说明，并不是所有的人都喜欢由于苏联政府的努力而开始了的国际紧张局势的缓和的，相反的，某些人希望保持这种紧张局势，进一步扩大使各国人民遭到沉重负担的军备竞赛。
    苏联政府曾经一再声明，它认为四国政府首脑会议的任务是缓和国际紧张局势和促进国与国之间的信任。如果一切有关的国家不是在口头上、而是在行动上努力使会议取得建设性的结果，会议是可以得到这种结果的。
