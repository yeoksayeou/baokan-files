Seize the Time to Prepare for Flood Prevention Work

The flood season this year is approaching. After the Central Flood Control Headquarters issued instructions on flood prevention work for 1955 on April 25, the People's Committees of various provinces have successively held flood prevention meetings and have begun to deploy flood prevention work based on the specific conditions of their respective provinces. This is very necessary. The tense flood prevention struggle is now upon us. The current task is to seize the time, concentrate our efforts, and do a good job in preparing for flood prevention, striving to safely get through the flood season and ensure increased agricultural production.

Last year, the people of our country overcame a flood unprecedented in a century. After the flood receded, the Party and government leading organs in various localities led the broad masses of people along the rivers, along the rivers, and along the lakes in engaging in huge projects such as drainage, breach closure, and routine maintenance of dikes; the dike sections where dangers occurred have been vigorously heightened and strengthened. These works have created favorable conditions for this year's flood prevention struggle. However, it would be completely wrong to think that we can be complacent because we have repaired these projects this year.

The flood control capacity of the dikes of the main rivers has indeed been strengthened after years of continuous renovation, especially the huge earthwork projects carried out last winter and this spring. However, it should be recognized that in some areas, due to the excessive task of breach closure and dike restoration last year, the flood receded very late, and coupled with excessive rain and snow last winter and this spring, many dike sections were repaired in a short period of time amidst the rain and snow. Therefore, the quality of some dike projects is not up to standard. For example, in the maintenance project of the Yangtze River's main dike in the Sixth District of Hanyang, work was rushed during the freezing period, and the soil material had a high moisture content. Some dike sections have developed cracks or collapses on the dike slope. During the dike repair period in the West Dongting Lake area of Hunan, due to the thick silt accumulation on the dike foundation and the large amount of water accumulated in the lake, the soil material on the dike was relatively wet, resulting in the collapse of a 700-meter-long section of the dike body. Moreover, the existing dikes in our country are mostly renovated on the basis of old dikes, and various hidden dangers in the old dike foundation and dike body constantly threaten the safety of the dikes. Although the water conservancy departments at all levels have led the broad masses in carrying out large-scale cone penetration and reconstruction work over the years, it is impossible to eliminate all hidden dangers completely. If we encounter extraordinarily large floods, some dikes may still be in danger of accidents or even breaches. Therefore, the idea that the existing dikes are already foolproof is unfounded.

Some people think that since an extraordinarily large flood occurred last year, how could it happen again this year? Even if the dikes are not as ideal as they could be, who can say that problems will definitely occur? In most cases, major floods do not occur year after year. However, the Yellow River, Yangtze River, Han River, Daqing River and other rivers have all had records of relatively large floods occurring in consecutive years. At present, our meteorological forecasting work cannot fully grasp the laws of changes in weather and water conditions. What reason is there to determine that there will definitely be no major flood this year?

There is an old saying in our country: "Water and fire are merciless." In fact, floods are not terrible, because they can be prevented and controlled. However, complacency is very terrible, because it will make people lose vigilance and not make adequate preparations. As a result, avoidable disasters may occur, and small disasters may turn into large disasters. In 1954, the flood prevention agencies in Hebei Province underestimated the possibility of an early arrival of floods and failed to seize the time to arrange flood prevention work early. Only when they discovered that the Hutuo River, Ziya River, and Daqing River had all experienced floods exceeding the guaranteed water level did they begin to prepare for flood prevention work. They were caught off guard in a hurry and fell into a passive position. Some dike sections breached because they could not be blocked in time. In Henan, Anhui, Liaoning and other regions, there have been incidents of dike breaches due to carelessness and lax defense. For a considerable period of time, before the fundamental treatment of the main rivers is completed, flood prevention work will always be an important task to defend the socialist construction of the country, protect the lives and property of the people along the rivers and lakes, and ensure the completion of agricultural production increase tasks. Therefore, in the flood prevention struggle, we must immediately overcome all kinds of complacency and wishful thinking, envision the most serious situation, and make the most adequate preparations.

At present, some dike projects in some areas have not yet completed the established plan, and we must immediately seize the opportunity to complete them within the deadline. If it is necessary to reduce the amount of work due to the approaching flood season, we should also concentrate the existing manpower and material resources on key projects and strive to complete the construction before the flood season. Necessary repairs and reinforcements must be carried out on dike sections with poor quality that are prone to danger.

Planning temporary flood diversion measures in advance is also a very important task. Now, the dikes of many rivers cannot withstand extraordinarily large floods. Under the leadership of the local Party committees and governments, flood prevention agencies at all levels should immediately carry out the necessary preparatory work so that they can proactively carry out temporary flood diversion in case of an extraordinarily large flood, minimizing the disaster. When determining the temporary flood diversion plan, we must do a solid job in specific planning and make proper arrangements for various issues related to the vital interests of the masses in the flood diversion area.

The flood season has arrived in the southern provinces. The flood prevention command organizations and mass flood prevention organizations in these areas should be formed immediately, and responsibility areas should be clearly divided, so that each dike section has dedicated personnel responsible for patrolling and defense. In the past, although some areas had established flood prevention organizations, the division of responsibilities was unclear, and the tasks were not clearly explained. When the flood came, the command was ineffective. This situation must be prevented. To overcome floods, we must rely on the strength of the broad masses of the people; and whether the strength of the masses can be fully exerted depends on whether the mobilization work is thorough and whether the organization work is meticulous, scientific, and specific. This is the main experience of the flood prevention struggle in recent years, and it should be well applied to this year's flood prevention work. In order to solve various problems in the flood prevention preparation work in a timely manner, the Party committees and governments of various provinces and regions should urge the water conservancy departments to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the existing preparation work so as to truly do a good job in the flood prevention preparation work.

Our Party and government leading organs at all levels and the broad masses of the people have been tested by the struggle to overcome extraordinarily large floods in 1954, and our experience in flood prevention has become richer and our confidence in overcoming floods has increased a hundredfold. As long as we thoroughly eliminate complacency and systematically and meticulously prepare for flood prevention, then we will surely be able to overcome floods.

### 抓紧时间做好防汛准备工作

    抓紧时间做好防汛准备工作
    今年的汛期就要到来了。中央防汛总指挥部在四月二十五日发出关于一九五五年防汛工作的指示以后，各省人民委员会已先后召开了防汛会议，根据本省的情况，着手布置防汛工作，这是很必要的。紧张的防汛斗争现在已经临到我们的面前了。当前的任务是抓紧时间，集中力量，做好防汛准备工作，力争安全渡过汛期，保证农业的增产。
    去年，我国人民战胜了百年少有的洪水。洪水退落以后，各地党政领导机关又领导沿江、沿河、沿湖的广大人民，从事排涝、堵口、堤防岁修等巨大工程；发生过险情的堤段，都已大力加高加固。这些工作给今年的防汛斗争创造了有利的条件。但是，如果认为今年修了这些工程，就已有恃无恐，那就完全错误了。
    各个主要河流的堤防，经过几年来不断的整修，特别是在去冬今春进行了巨大的土方工程，它的防汛力量的确是比过去加强了。但是，应该认识，在若干地区，由于去年堵口复堤任务过大，洪水退落很晚，加以去冬今春雨雪过多，许多堤段是用短促的时间在雨雪之中修复的。因此，堤防工程的质量有的不合标准。如汉阳六区长江干堤的培修工程，在上冻期全力赶工，土料含水量很大，有的堤段堤坡已发生裂缝或塌陷现象。湖南西洞庭湖区堤防修复时期，由于堤基积淤很厚，湖地积水甚多，上堤的土料较湿，以至有七百多公尺长的一段堤身发生塌陷现象。而且，我国现有的堤防多是在旧堤的基础上整修起来的，旧堤堤基和堤身的各种隐患经常威胁着堤防的安全。几年以来，各级水利部门虽然领导广大群众进行了大规模的锥探、翻筑工作，但还不可能把一切隐患消除净尽。如果遇到特大洪水，有些堤防仍有发生险情甚至溃决的危险。因此，那种认为现有堤防都已经万无一失的思想是没有根据的。
    有些人认为，去年既然发过了特大洪水，今年那里还会再发呢？即使堤防没有理想的那么好，谁能说一定发生问题呢？在多数情况下，大水确实不是连年发生的。但黄河、长江、汉水、大清河等河流，都有过连年发生较大洪水的记载。目前，我们的气象预报工作还不能充分掌握天时变化和水情变化的规律，有什么理由能断定今年必然不会有大洪水呢？
    我国有句古话：“水火无情”。其实，洪水并不可怕，因为它是可以防治的。麻痹思想却很可怕，因为它会使人失掉警惕，不作充分的准备，结果，可以避免的灾害就可能发生了，小的灾害也可能变成大的灾害。一九五四年，河北省的防汛机关对洪水可能提早到来估计不足，没有争取时间及早布置防汛工作；发现滹沱河、子牙河、大清河都已发生超过保证水位的洪水，方才开始作防汛准备工作，仓促应战，陷于被动，有的堤段因抢堵不及，竟至决口。河南、安徽、辽宁等地区都曾发生过因麻痹大意、防守不严而致堤防溃决的事情。在相当长的时期以内，在完成各主要河流的根本治理以前，防汛工作始终是保卫国家的社会主义建设事业，保护江、河、湖岸人民生命财产，保证农业增产任务完成的重要工作。因此，在防汛斗争中，必须立即克服各种麻痹思想和侥幸心理，设想到最严重的情况，进行最充分的准备。
    目前有些地区的堤防工程还没有完成既定的计划，必须立即抓紧时机限期完成。如果因为汛期迫近必须削减工程数量，也应该把现有的人力、物力集中在重点工程上，力争在汛期以前修建完工。对于质量太差、容易发生险情的堤段，必须进行必要的修补和加强。
    事先妥善筹划临时性的分洪措施也是一项非常重要的工作。现在许多河流的堤防，遇到特大的洪水，还是不能抵御的。各级防汛机关要在当地党委和政府领导下，立即进行必要的准备工作，以便在万一遇到特大洪水的时候，能主动地进行临时性的分洪，缩小灾害到最低的限度。确定临时性分洪计划的时候，要切实做好具体的规划，对有关分洪区群众切身利益的各种问题，进行妥善的安排。
    现在南方各省已到汛期，这些地区的各级防汛指挥机构和群众的防汛组织要立即组成，并明确划分责任区，做到每一堤段都有专人负责巡逻、防守。过去，有些地区虽然建立了防汛组织，但职责划分不清，任务交代不明，洪水到来，指挥不灵，这种情况必须加以防止。要战胜洪水必须依靠广大群众的力量；而群众的力量能否充分发挥出来，则取决于动员工作是否深入，组织工作是否细致、科学、具体。这是几年来防汛斗争的主要经验，应该把它很好地运用到今年的防汛工作中来。为了及时解决防汛准备工作中的各种问题，各个省区党委和政府应该督促水利部门，对现有的各项准备工作进行一次全面的检查，以便把防汛准备工作真正做好。
    我们的各级党、政领导机关和广大人民经过了一九五四年战胜特大洪水的斗争考验，防汛的经验更加丰富了，战胜洪水的信心百倍地提高了。我们只要彻底肃清麻痹思想，系统地、周密地做好防汛准备工作，那末，我们就一定能够战胜洪水。
