Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 19th: Under the strong demands of the Cambodian people, the Royal Cambodian Government announced through Phnom Penh Radio on the 10th the U.S.-Cambodia military aid agreement, which was signed in mid-May.

The main points of this agreement are: the United States will provide Cambodia with direct military aid; U.S. military mission personnel sent to Cambodia will enjoy privileges and immunities; equipment and materials transported by the United States to Cambodia, and all equipment and materials passing through Cambodian territory to other countries receiving U.S. military aid, will be exempt from customs duties and other domestic taxes; Cambodia will supply the U.S. government with Cambodian currency as administrative expenses and activity funds for implementing the military aid plan; Cambodia will supply the U.S. or other governments with equipment, materials, services, and all other assistance determined by both parties to enhance so-called "defense capabilities" or facilitate their effective participation in the "collective security system."

Vietnam News Agency reported on the 19th that this military aid agreement has been strongly opposed by the Cambodian people. Vietnam News Agency quoted a commentary from the "Solidarity Newspaper" published in Phnom Penh, saying: U.S. aid is merely a noose around the neck of the Cambodian people. The Cambodian people realize that U.S. aid will lead them to danger. U.S. imperialists say that it will help Cambodia fight against "communist aggression," but in fact, there is no "communist aggression" at all. Obviously, the United States is attempting to drag Cambodia into war, using the Cambodian people as cannon fodder to protect U.S. interests, and attempting to turn Cambodian territory into a springboard for attacking China.

The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article on the 19th, pointing out that the U.S.-Cambodia military aid agreement clearly shows that Cambodia will become a U.S. imperialist military base and powder keg in Indochina, which completely violates the Geneva Accords. The article pointed out that the Royal Cambodian Government's signing of this military agreement with the United States also violated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which Sihanouk announced he supported during his visit to India; at the same time, it forfeited Cambodia's national sovereignty. The article said that Vietnam is one of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference and has the responsibility to work with other countries to ensure peace in Indochina. Vietnam cannot but be concerned about the situation created by the military aid agreement signed between the United States and Cambodia. Vietnam, together with responsible countries attending the Geneva Conference and all peace-loving countries, demands that the armistice agreement must be strictly implemented in Cambodia and that the final declaration of the Geneva Conference must be respected, and demands an immediate end to actions aimed at sabotaging peace in Cambodia.

    柬埔寨王国政府公布美国——柬埔寨军事援助协定
    越“人民报”指出美柬协定违背日内瓦协定
    新华社河内十九日电在柬埔寨人民的强烈要求下，柬埔寨王国政府十日通过金边电台公布了早在五月中旬签订的美国—柬埔寨军事援助协定。
    这个协定的要点是：美国将给予柬埔寨以直接的军事援助；美国派往柬埔寨的军事代表团人员将享有特权和豁免；美国运往柬埔寨的装备、物资和一切经过柬埔寨领土运往其他接受美国军事援助的国家的装备和物资，免收关税和其他国内捐税；柬埔寨将以柬埔寨货币供给美国政府，作为实现军事援助计划的行政开支和活动费；柬埔寨将以装备、物资、服务和一切双方协议确定的其他援助，供给美国或他国政府，名义上是增强所谓“防御能力”或便于它们有效地参加“集体安全体系”。
    越南通讯社十九日报道说，这个军事援助协定遭到柬埔寨人民的强烈反对。越南通讯社引述了金边出版的“团结报”的评论说：美国援助只是套在柬埔寨人民颈项上的绳圈。柬埔寨人民认识到美援将把他们引向危险。美帝国主义者说，它将帮助柬埔寨对“共产党侵略”战斗，事实上根本没有“共产党侵略”。显然，美国企图把柬埔寨拖入战争，利用柬埔寨人民作为炮灰，来保护美国的利益，并且企图把柬埔寨领土变为进攻中国的跳板。
    越南“人民报”十九日发表文章指出，美国—柬埔寨军事援助协定清楚地显示柬埔寨将变为美帝国主义在印度支那的军事基地和火药库，这完全违背了日内瓦协定。文章指出，柬埔寨王国政府同美国签订这个军事协定，也违背了西哈努克在访问印度时宣布支持的五项和平共处原则；同时，丧失了柬埔寨的民族主权。文章说，越南是参加日内瓦会议的国家之一，有责任同其他国家一起保障印度支那的和平。越南不能不关心由于美国同柬埔寨签订的军事援助协定所造成的局势。越南同出席日内瓦会议的有责任的国家和一切热爱和平的国家，要求在柬埔寨必须严格履行停战协定和尊重日内瓦会议最后宣言，要求立即停止阴谋破坏柬埔寨的和平的行动。
