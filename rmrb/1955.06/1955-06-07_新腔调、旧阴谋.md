    New Tune, Old Conspiracy
    Qin Benli

    In the past year, some noteworthy tones have emerged in the pronouncements of American officials regarding Asian policy. One of them is expressing "concern" for Asia's economic development.

    This argument began to be put forward by American officials after the Geneva Conference, and later it became more and more lively. Before and during the Asian-African Conference, it was greatly publicized around President Eisenhower's proposed "Mutual Security Program" for the next fiscal year. It is no accident that the United States is singing this tune so loudly at this time.

    During the period from the Geneva Conference to the Asian-African Conference, many events occurred in Asia that were encouraging: despite American interference, the Indochina War finally reached a ceasefire agreement; many major Asian countries refused to join the military aggression bloc against the People's Republic of China organized by the United States; the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly issued by China and India, and China and Burma, were warmly praised by the people of the world; despite the United States' attempts to undermine it, the Asian-African Conference, without the participation of Western colonial countries, was finally successfully held and achieved significant results. All of these greatly promoted the development of peace in the Asian region, causing the United States' "policy of strength" in Asia to suffer repeated failures. The prestige of the United States in Asia has declined. This view is also reflected within the American ruling circles. Senator Mansfield of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee admitted: "In the minds of many people throughout Asia, our overemphasis on force has relegated normal and accepted methods of negotiation in human relations to a secondary position. This undermines our dignity and prestige." Obviously, with the rising awareness of the Asian people, the American ruling circles, while continuing to promote strength, have had to consider changing their tune.

    On the other hand, it is the urgent desire of the people of Asian countries to get rid of backwardness and establish and develop national industries. At the same time, the economic development of countries in the democratic camp, led by the Soviet Union, especially the fact that the People's Republic of China has achieved tremendous economic achievements in just a few years, and the increasingly developing economic and trade relations between countries in the democratic camp and Asian countries based on equality, mutual benefit, and respect for national sovereignty, are having an increasingly greater impact on the people of Asian countries. This has aroused the unease of American imperialists. An Associated Press reporter said in his year-end review on December 31, 1954, that China's "rate of industrialization has caused government personnel to feel surprised and make decisions for their new plans." In order to resist the ever-expanding influence of the economic development of peaceful and democratic camp countries, and to use the urgent desire of the Asian people to deceive them, the colonialists in Washington also felt the need to play some new tricks in propaganda.

    "Time Magazine" in the United States said last December: "The United States is preparing to open a new front in the Cold War... Stassen, director of the Foreign Operations Administration, which is scheduled to end next summer, has proposed an ambitious plan." Washington's new tone is born out of the needs of the Cold War under the new situation. This is clear.

    A simple examination of the economic situation in the United States can clearly show the complete hypocrisy of the United States' new tune.

    In the past two years, the American economy, which has embarked on the path of militarization, has become increasingly unstable. The US industrial production index (with 1947-1949 as 100) fell from 134 in 1953 to 125 in 1954, a decrease of 9 percent. After falling from the post-war peak of 137 in July 1953 to 123 in March 1954, it remained at this low level from March to August 1954. Private enterprise investment in 1954 decreased by 6 percent compared with 1953, and is expected to decrease by another 5 percent this year. Agricultural products accumulated in the hands of the US government are currently worth nearly 7.5 billion US dollars; according to the current trend, they will increase a lot by the end of this year. The number of unemployed workers is about 5 million, and as many as 9 million people suffered from unemployment of varying lengths in 1954. Farmers' income has been declining continuously since 1952. Farmers' income in 1954 decreased by 5 percent compared with 1953, and the trend of farmers' income decline is still developing this year. In order to alleviate the economic crisis and postpone the approaching economic storm, the government of American monopoly capitalists is doing everything possible to stimulate production, such as expanding loans, maintaining a high level of military spending, and other measures that benefit large enterprises, such as abolishing the excess profits tax. At the same time, it is also stepping up the development of overseas commodity and investment markets to digest surplus products and ensure the maximum profits of monopoly capital. This is the economic background of the United States' great fanfare about "helping" Asian countries with its "new plan."

    American officials often cite Eisenhower's recently proposed "Mutual Security Program" for the next fiscal year as an example of the United States' willingness to help other countries develop their economies. However, it is enough to illustrate the actual value of the above statement by simply mentioning that out of the total appropriation of 3.53 billion US dollars, more than 2.7 billion US dollars are formally and directly used for military purposes.

    In order to dilute the military nature of this plan, the US government has listed 1.7 billion US dollars directly used by the United States for the direct delivery of military manufactured products, or for providing training expenses, and part of the overseas military order expenditures under the military "aid" project; and actually used for military purposes. The supply of raw materials, daily industrial products, machine tools, agricultural products, building materials, warehouse equipment, medical equipment, etc. to the "aided" countries totals 1 billion US dollars, which are all listed under the so-called "economic assistance" items. Here is an example of this "economic assistance" item: "Pakistan - 92 million US dollars, including 20 million US dollars for direct troop support, 63 million US dollars for defense support, and 9 million US dollars for technical cooperation." The so-called "direct troop support" in these projects is the supply of daily necessities for the army, etc.; the so-called "defense support" is "to assist in establishing a country's civilian economy," but the purpose is still to "support the expanded military machine." It seems that the purely economic "technical cooperation" and other "assistance" are first and foremost for the United States to obtain the strategic materials it needs from the "aided" countries.

    Former "Marshall Plan" executor Hoffman said very frankly: "In the current situation, military assistance and economic assistance are essentially the same." He also said: "Both are actually economic assistance; but both are mainly for military purposes. One mainly contains military equipment produced by the United States, while the other is mostly to enable recipient countries to engage in more military production."

    The economic significance of foreign "aid" to the United States can be said a little more. With the increasing decline in overall economic activity in the United States, American monopoly capitalists are eagerly seeking to increase capital exports. Eisenhower emphasized in his foreign economic policy message to Congress in January this year the importance of expanding US overseas investment to support US domestic economic activities in crisis. The US government's foreign "aid" serves this purpose at the same time. Since the implementation of the "aid" plan, American capital investment in Asian (including Australia) and African countries has increased significantly, from 1.086 billion US dollars in 1949 to 2.085 billion US dollars in 1953, an increase of nearly 100 percent. Eisenhower specifically emphasized increasing investment in backward regions in his "Mutual Security Program" message, which is completely understandable. Because the cheap labor and raw materials in backward countries enable American monopoly capitalists to obtain mythically high profits. For example, in 1953, the average profit obtained from American investment in Asian and African countries was 25.6 percent, with individual countries as high as 30 percent or more. This greatly exceeded the general profit rate in the United States. New Jersey Mobil Oil Company, one of the largest oil companies in the United States, earned two-thirds of its total net profit in 1952 from companies operating outside the United States. The profit rate of foreign investment is almost three times that of domestic investment. Obviously, this kind of investment for the purpose of plunder and exploitation has nothing in common with the real development of the industries of backward countries. On the contrary, the consequence of this increased investment is to colonize the "aided" countries and turn them into appendages of American imperialism for selling goods and supplying raw materials.

    American "aid" also helps build some industries, but they can only be subsidiary enterprises of the American economy, and cannot be independent national industries in backward countries. Eisenhower explained this point in his report to Congress on January 20: "The increase in foreign investment will accelerate the development of foreign industries, whose products are necessary to meet our growing need for raw materials and other products."

    The facts are very clear. The American propaganda machine wants to make it seem as if the focus of the United States' policy toward Asia has shifted from military to economic, and as if the United States is now concerned about the economic development of Asian countries. This tune cannot deceive the Asian people. Its content is still that old conspiracy, to ensure the highest profits of American monopoly capital, enslave the Asian people, and prepare for new wars. The Asian people have already seen through the tricks of American colonialism. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said: "We cannot use American money to make ourselves prosperous." Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, who refused to accept this so-called "aid" from the United States, also said: "Even if there are no conditions attached, we still believe that if we do not accept economic assistance, we can work better for peace."

    新腔调、旧阴谋
    钦本立
    一年以来，在美国官员对亚洲政策的言论中，出现了一些值得注意的调子。其中之一：就是对亚洲的经济发展表示“关心”。
    这种论调，在日内瓦会议以后就开始被美国官员提出来了，以后越唱越热闹，在亚非会议前和会议期间，围绕着美国总统艾森豪威尔提出的下一个财政年度“共同安全计划”又大大张扬了一阵。美国在这样的时间大唱起这种调子来不是偶然的。
    从日内瓦会议到亚非会议这段时间，在亚洲发生的许多事件是令人鼓舞的：不顾美国的干涉，印度支那战争终于达成停战协议；亚洲许多主要国家拒绝参加美国组织的针对中华人民共和国的军事侵略集团；中国和印度、中国和缅甸联合发表的和平共处五项原则受到世界人民热烈赞扬；尽管美国怎样设法破坏，没有西方殖民国家参加的亚非会议终于胜利召开，并取得重大成就。所有这些，大大地促进了亚洲地区和平事业的发展，使得美国在亚洲的
  “实力政策”接二连三地遭到失败。美国在亚洲的威信日益低落了。美国统治集团内部也反映了这种看法。美参议院外交委员会委员曼斯菲尔德就承认：“在全亚洲的许多人心中，由于我们过分强调武力，因此把人类关系中的正常的和公认的谈判办法放在次要地位。这破坏了我们的尊严和威信。”显而易见，在亚洲人民的觉醒日益高涨的情形下，美国统治集团一面继续宣扬实力，一面又不得不考虑改变一下腔调。
    另一方面，摆脱落后状态，建立和发展民族的工业，是亚洲国家人民的迫切愿望。同时，以苏联为首的民主阵营各国的经济发展，特别是中华人民共和国在短短几年中获得巨大经济成就的事实，以及民主阵营各国在平等互利、尊重国家主权的基础上和亚洲国家日益发展着的经济关系和贸易关系，对亚洲国家的人民正在发生越来越大的影响。这引起了美国帝国主义分子的不安。美联社记者在一九五四年十二月三十一日所发的年终回顾中就说：中国“工业化速度的数字已使政府人员在感觉惊讶之下要为他们的新计划作出决定。”为了抵制和平民主阵营国家经济发展的事实日益扩大的影响，为了利用亚洲人民的迫切愿望来欺骗亚洲人民，华盛顿的殖民主义者也感到需要在宣传上耍些新花招。
    美国“时代周刊”在去年十二月说过：“美国正在准备开辟一个冷战的新战线……预定在明年夏天结束的援外事务管理署署长史塔生曾经提出一个雄心勃勃的计划。”华盛顿的新论调就是在新的形势下，出于冷战的需要。这是明明白白的。
    对美国的经济情况作一番简单的考察就可以清楚地看到美国的新腔调的全部虚伪性。
    近两年来，走上军事化道路的美国经济显得愈来愈不稳定。美国工业生产指数（以一九四七—一九四九年为一○○）由一九五三年的一三四下降到一九五四年的一二五，下降了百分之九，从一九五三年七月的一三七战后高峰降到一九五四年三月的
  一二三后，在一九五四年三月到八月始终维持在这个低水平上。一九五四年私人企业投资额比一九五三年减少百分之六，预期今年将再减少百分之五，积压在美国政府手上的农产品目前就有价值已近七十五亿美元；按目前趋势到今年年底还要增加很多。失业工人数字约有五百万，有九百万之多的人在一九五四年遭受时间长短不等的失业。农民收入自一九五二年起就不断减少，一九五四年农民收入就比一九五三年减少百分之五，今年农民收入减少的趋势仍在继续发展。为了缓和经济危机，推延逼近中的经济风暴，美国垄断资本家的政府正在竭尽一切办法，诸如扩大贷款、维持高度军事开支水平以及其他一些有利于大企业的措施如取消过分利得税等，来刺激生产。同时它也加紧开辟海外的商品和投资市场，来消纳过剩的生产品，保障垄断资本的最大利润。这就是美国大事宣扬要“帮助”亚洲国家的“新计划”的经济背景。
    美国官员常常举出艾森豪威尔最近提出的下一个财政年度“共同安全计划”作为美国愿意帮助其他国家发展经济的例子，但是只要举出：在三十五亿三千万美元拨款总数中，有二十七亿美元以上正式直接用在军事目的上，就足以说明上述说法的实际价值了。
    为了冲淡这个计划的军事性质，美国政府把由美国为直接运交军事制成品、或提供训练费用以及一部分在海外军事订货支出的十七亿美元，列入军事性“援助”项目下；而把实际上是用于军事目的的供应受“援”国的原料、日用工业品、机器工具、农产品、建筑器材、仓库设备、医药器材等共计十亿美元都列入所谓“经济援助”项下。这里可以举出这种“经济援助”项下的一个例子：“巴基斯坦—九千二百万美元，包括直接部队支持二千万美元、防御支持六千三百万美元和技术合作九百万美元。”这些项目中的所谓“直接部队支持”就是供应军队的日用品等；所谓“防御支持”是“要协助建立一个国家的民用经济”的，但目的还在于“支持扩大的军事机器”。看来似乎纯粹经济性的“技术合作”之类“援助”，也首先和主要是为美国从受“援”国家取得它所需要的战略物资。
    前“马歇尔计划”执行人霍夫曼曾说得很坦白：“在目前情况下，军事援助和经济援助在基本上是一样的。”他又说：“两者实际上都是经济援助；但两者主要都是为了军事目的。一种内容主要是美国所生产的军事装备，而另一种则大部分是使受援国家从事更多的军事生产。”
    对外“援助”对美国的经济意义，还可以多说一点。在美国整个经济活动日益衰退的情况下，美国垄断资本家急切谋求增加资本输出。艾森豪威尔今年一月间向国会提出的对外经济政策咨文中，就曾强调扩大美国向海外投资对于支持美国国内的处在危机中的经济活动的重要性。美国政府的对外“援助”就同时为这一目的服务。执行“援助”计划以来，美国资本在亚（包括澳洲）、非国家的投资有了显著的增加，一九四九年为十亿八千六百万美元；一九五三年增加到二十亿八千五百万美元，增加近一倍。艾森豪威尔在他的“共同安全计划”咨文中，特别强调增加对落后地区的投资，这是完全可以了解的。因为落后国家中的廉价劳动和原料，使美国垄断资本家获得神话般的高额利润。例如，一九五三年，美国在亚、非国家的投资得到的平均利润为百分之二十五·六，其中个别国家竟高达百分之三十以上。这大大超过了美国国内一般的利润率。美国最大的石油公司之一的新泽西美孚油公司，一九五二年的净利总额中有三分之二靠在美国以外经营的公司赚来的。国外投资的利润率几乎为国内投资利润率的三倍。显然，这种以掠夺和剥削为目的的投资和真正发展落后国家的工业是毫无共同之处的。而且恰恰相反，这种投资增加的后果，就是使受“援”国的殖民地化，变成美国帝国主义销售商品、供应原料的附属物。
    美国的“援助”也帮助建设一部分工业，但那只能是美国经济的附属企业，而不能够是落后国家独立的民族工业。艾森豪威尔在一月二十日向国会的报告里就说明了这一点：“对外投资的增加将加速外国工业的发展，它们的产品是为满足我们对原料和其他产品的日益增长的需要所必需的。”
    事实非常清楚。美国宣传机器想把事情说成似乎美国对亚洲政策重点已从军事方面转到经济方面，似乎美国现在对亚洲国家经济的发展关心起来，这种腔调骗不了亚洲人民。它的内容还是那个老阴谋，保证美国垄断资本的最高利润，奴役亚洲人民，并准备新战争。亚洲人民已经看穿了美国殖民主义的花招。印度总理尼赫鲁就说：“我们不能用美国的钱来使自己繁荣。”拒绝接受美国这种所谓“援助”的缅甸总理吴努也说过：“纵然不附有什么条件，我们仍然认为如果不接受经济援助，我们可以更好地为和平而工作。”
