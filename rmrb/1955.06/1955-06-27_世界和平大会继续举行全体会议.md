Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, June 25th: According to TASS, the World Peace Congress held a plenary session on the afternoon of the 24th. The session was chaired by Abdoulaye Diallo, the representative of Sudan.

    Finnish representative Von Bonsdorff spoke first, discussing the issue of peaceful coexistence between different types of countries.

    Le Dinh Tham, representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, spoke about the Vietnamese people's struggle and efforts to achieve peace and develop friendly relations with all countries.

    Syrian parliamentarian Salih Aqil spoke in his address about the Syrian people's struggle to achieve peace and defend their country's independence and sovereignty.

    Soviet representative Nesterov, in his speech, called for the development of international trade as a basis for easing international tensions.

    Former French parliamentarian and representative of French West Africa, D’Arboussier, spoke about the African people's movement for freedom and independence. He said that easing international tensions, banning weapons of mass destruction, and disarmament were of great significance to the African people. D’Arboussier pointed out that Africa was unwilling to be a plaything in the hands of colonial countries and hoped to actively participate in resolving international problems.

    Deuski, Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Polish Parliament, said that people all over the world unanimously demanded the prohibition of atomic weapons and the prevention of a new war. Humanity yearns for a peaceful resolution of all disputes with respect for the sovereignty of all countries and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. He said: Two world wars have taught us; without a collective security system, aggressors will be emboldened. It is precisely for this reason that eight European countries recently concluded the Warsaw Treaty, which is open to all countries. This treaty is a warning to aggressors. Deuski called on the German people to abandon the policy of military blocs. He said that the Polish people hope to be friendly with all the German people and hope to establish a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany.

    French National Assembly member d'Astier de la Vigerie spoke about the achievements of the peace movement in the past two years. He went on to say that the US government agreed to hold high-level talks because it had to take into account the mood of public opinion in Western Europe, especially the hostility of the French and German people towards the arming of West Germany. This meeting was convened in an atmosphere of demanding a relaxation of tensions, and at a time when the public was strongly demanding negotiations.

    D'Astier de la Vigerie then spoke about the shortcomings that still exist in the peace movement in terms of broadly uniting all peace forces. He said that in capitalist countries there are still some peace forces that have not joined the movement. He stressed that it is necessary to try to reach many groups that still stand outside the peace movement. For example, the Christian movement, the British Labour movement, and the huge social democratic organizations in many countries of Germany, France, and Scandinavia. D'Astier de la Vigerie concluded by saying that advocating unity is not a temporary tactic for us. Peace is neither ours nor yours, but everyone's. However, universal peace is only guaranteed when common goals are determined and we act together for these goals that represent the will of the majority. This common goal is to strive to ensure that the Four-Power Conference does not disappoint the expectations of the world and strives to ensure that this conference takes a step forward on the road to satisfying the demands of the people of all countries for disarmament, security, and peace.

    The last speaker at the meeting was former Mexican Minister Heriberto Jara. He spoke about how American imperialists plunder the wealth of Latin America under the guise of so-called economic "aid" and other "aid." He said, however, that in our countries the forces of peace are growing, so we must not allow ourselves to be turned into an arsenal for the United States to prepare for a new world war. He called for not stopping at the achievements already made, but striving to find new ways to fight the warmongers and to strengthen the unity of peace forces around the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, June 26th: According to TASS, the committees of the World Peace Congress continued their work on the 25th. These committees are: the Disarmament and Atomic Weapons Committee, the Military Blocs and Security Committee, the National Sovereignty and Peace Committee, and other committees.

    The World Peace Congress will hold a plenary session on the 26th.

    世界和平大会继续举行全体会议
    新华社二十五日讯  据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：世界和平大会在二十四日下午举行了全体大会。由苏丹代表阿卜杜拉·迪亚洛担任主席。
    芬兰代表邦斯多夫首先发言，他谈到了各种不同类型的国家和平共处的问题。
    越南民主共和国代表黎廷探讲述了越南人民为争取和平和发展同各国之间的友好关系所进行的斗争和努力。
    叙利亚议员萨勒哈·阿基尔在发言中讲到叙利亚人民为争取和平和保卫祖国的独立和主权而进行的斗争。
    苏联代表湼斯捷罗夫在发言中呼吁发展国际贸易以作为缓和国际紧张局势的基础。
    前法国议会议员、法属西非洲代表达波赛在发言中谈到非洲人民争取自由和独立的运动。他说，缓和国际紧张局势、禁止大规模毁灭性武器、裁减军备，对非洲人民来说有很大的意义。达波赛指出，非洲不愿成为殖民国家手中的玩物，而希望积极参加解决国际问题。
    波兰议会外交委员会副主席德乌斯基说，全世界的人都一致要求禁止原子武器和防止发生新战争。人类渴望着在尊重各国主权和不干涉他国内政的情况下和平解决一切纠纷问题。他说：两次世界大战教育了我们；没有集体安全体系，就会使侵略者胆大妄为。正因为如此，欧洲八个国家在不久以前缔结了华沙条约，而这一条约是一切国家都可以参加的。这一条约对侵略者来说是一个警告。德乌斯基呼吁德国人民弃绝军事集团政策。他说，波兰人民希望同全体德国人民友好，希望建立一个统一、民主、和平的德国。
    法国国民议会议员达斯迪埃·德拉维热里在发言中谈到和平运动近两年来的成就。他接着说，美国政府所以同意举行高级谈判，是因为它不得不考虑到西欧舆论的情绪，尤其是法国人民和德国人民对武装西德所抱的敌视态度。这一会议是在要求和缓紧张局势的气氛中，在公众十分强烈地要求举行谈判的时候召开的。
    达斯迪埃·德拉维热里接着谈到了和平运动在广泛团结一切和平力量方面还存在的缺点。他说，在资本主义国家里还有些和平力量没有参加这一运动。他强调指出，必须设法接近那些至今还站在和平运动之外的许多团体。例如，基督教运动，英国工党运动，以及德国、法国和斯堪的纳维亚半岛许多国家的巨大的社会民主党组织。达斯迪埃·德拉维热里最后说，主张团结对我们来说不是一时的策略。和平，不是我们的，也不是你们的，而是大家的。但是，只有在确定了共同的目的并且为这代表了大多数人意志的目的而共同行动的情况下，普遍的和平才有保障。这种共同的目的就是努力争取使四国会议不辜负全世界的期望，争取使这一会议在满足各国人民要求裁军、安全及和平的愿望的道路上前进一步。
    会议上最后一个发言的是墨西哥前部长艾里伯尔托·哈拉。他谈到美国帝国主义者如何在所谓经济“援助”以及其他“援助”的借口下掠夺拉丁美洲的财富。他说，可是，在我们这些国家中和平力量正在成长，因此我们一定不让把我们变成为美国准备新世界大战的兵工厂。他号召不要停留在已取得的成就上，要努力寻找新的反对战争贩子的斗争方式，要加强全世界和平力量的团结。
    新华社二十六日讯  据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：世界和平大会各委员会二十五日继续进行工作。这些委员会是：裁减军备和原子武器问题委员会、军事集团和安全问题委员会、民族主权和和平问题委员会及其他委员会。
    世界和平大会将在二十六日举行全体会议。
