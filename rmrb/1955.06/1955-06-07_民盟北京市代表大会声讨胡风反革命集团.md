The China Democratic League Beijing Municipal Congress Denounces the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique

(Our report) The first congress of the China Democratic League Beijing Municipal Committee was held in Beijing on May 28th and 29th. The congress unanimously adopted a telegram denouncing the anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary crimes of Hu Feng and the Hu Feng clique. The content of the telegram is as follows:

The materials exposing the Hu Feng anti-Party, counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily" on May 13th and 24th prove that Hu Feng and the Hu Feng clique, under the guise of revolution, have long been engaged in conspiracies against the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, and the revolution. They used various insidious and vicious means to undermine the literary movement led by the Party and the entire revolutionary cause, causing serious damage to the revolutionary cause. The entire body of representatives attending the first congress of the China Democratic League Beijing Municipal Committee, like the people of the whole country, are extremely indignant at the crimes of Hu Feng and the Hu Feng clique. All representatives present unanimously support the resolution of the joint expanded meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, and call on all members of the League in the city to heighten their vigilance, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and fight to the end to completely smash the conspiracies of Hu Feng and the Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, counter-revolutionary clique!

    本报讯　五月二十八、二十九日，中国民主同盟北京市第一次代表大会在北京召开。大会一致通过声讨胡风和胡风集团反党、反人民、反革命罪行的代电。代电内容如下：
    “人民日报”五月十三日和二十四日揭发的胡风反党、反革命集团的材料，证明胡风与胡风集团，长期地打着革命的招牌，进行反对中国共产党、反对中国人民、反对革命的阴谋活动，以种种阴险毒辣手段，破坏党所领导的文艺运动及整个革命事业，给革命事业以严重的损害。中国民主同盟北京市第一次代表大会全体代表，和全国人民一样，对胡风与胡风集团的罪行，非常愤慨。到会全体代表一致支持中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席扩大会议的决议，并号召全市盟员，提高警惕，分清敌我，为彻底粉碎胡风与胡风的反党、反人民、反革命集团的阴谋活动而斗争到底！
