The construction project of Jiangxi Province's first modern Zhangshu Lumberyard has been basically completed. The main completed projects include the mechanized river extraction machine put into production on May 23, as well as telecommunications and searchlight equipment, a dedicated railway line, flatcar transportation equipment, office buildings, dormitories, medical clinics, and other labor protection buildings. The Zhangshu Lumberyard is a lumber collection and distribution center in the lower reaches of the Gan River. In the past, most of the timber rafts from the Gan River basin had to be manually carried on shoulders, up slopes, and loaded onto vehicles here, resulting in very low efficiency. Now, with the newly equipped mechanized river extraction and flatcar transportation equipment, a thousand laborers can be saved to support the production of the province's forest industry and other sectors.

During the construction process, assistance was received from Soviet experts. A suggestion to renovate the dedicated railway line alone doubled the loading rate. Support was also received from many machine manufacturing plants across the country during the construction.

    江西现代化樟树贮木场建成
    江西省第一座现代化的樟树贮木场建场工程基本完工。完工的主要工程除机械化出河机在五月二十三日投入生产以外，还有电讯探照、铁路专用线，平车道运输等设备，以及办公楼、宿舍、医疗所和其他劳动保护建筑。樟树贮木场是赣江下流的木材集散中心。过去来自赣江流域的大部分木排，必须在这里用人力肩运、起坡，装车效率很低，现在新备了机械化出河和平车道运输等设备，可以节省一千个劳动力支援省内森林工业和其他部门的生产。
    在建场过程中曾经得到苏联专家的协助，只改建铁路专用线一项建议，就提高了装车率一倍。建场中还得到全国很多机器制造厂的支援。
