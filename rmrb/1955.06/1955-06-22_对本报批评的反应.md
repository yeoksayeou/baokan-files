Responses to the Newspaper's Criticism

    Letter from the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau: After the People's Daily published Chen Hongxiang's article on April 26th, we immediately conducted an in-depth inspection of the use of university graduates in our bureau's technical departments in conjunction with the reorganization work and made the following arrangements.

      I. In accordance with the principle of "integration of learning and application," and in conjunction with the current reorganization work, the ten cadres who graduated from the telecommunications department and originally worked in the design department will be transferred to other departments for work or study. Those who are not suitable for any of our bureau's business will be transferred externally. Other departments will also be adjusted successively, and preparations are being made to transfer cadres who are not suitable for working in our bureau to suitable positions.

    II. In the reorganization work, the proportion of university graduates and secondary technical personnel in our bureau's design, maintenance and other departments will be determined to correct and prevent the phenomenon of excessive allocation of university graduates to various departments in the future.

    III. Strengthen cadre management, understand the use of cadres and their opinions in a timely manner, and overcome bureaucratic styles of work in cadre work.

    对本报批评的反应
    广播事业局来信：四月二十六日人民日报发表了陈鸿翔的文章后，我们即结合整编工作，对我局技术部门使用高等学校毕业生的情况进行了深入的检查，并作了如下的处理。
      一、按照“学用一致”的原则，结合目前正在进行的整编工作，将原在设计部门工作的十位电讯系毕业的干部调配到其他部门工作或学习；我局各项业务对他们都不适合的则外调；其他部门也将陆续调整，并准备将不适合在我局工作的干部外调到适宜的工作岗位上去。
    二、在整编工作中确定我局设计、维护等部门高等学校毕业生和中等技术人员的比例，纠正并防止今后各部门对高等学校毕业生配备过多的现象。
    三、加强干部管理工作，及时了解干部使用情况和干部意见，克服干部工作中的官僚主义作风。
