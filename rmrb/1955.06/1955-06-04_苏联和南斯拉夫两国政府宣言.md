Mićunović, Deputy Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, held talks in Belgrade and Brioni from May 27 to June 2, 1955. The talks proceeded in a friendly and mutually understanding atmosphere. During the talks, the two sides exchanged views on international issues of concern to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and comprehensively studied the issues of political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries.

(1)

The starting point of the talks was the common desire of the two governments to peacefully resolve international issues through negotiations and to strengthen cooperation between the peoples and countries of all nations.

The peoples and armed forces of the two countries, together with the freedom-loving peoples of other countries, particularly enhanced their friendship and combat cooperation in the years when they fought against the fascist aggressors.

The two governments agreed to take further measures to normalize relations and develop cooperation between the two countries. The two governments are convinced that this is in the interest of the peoples of both countries and is a contribution to easing tensions and consolidating the cause of world peace. During the talks, the two governments expressed a sincere desire to further develop comprehensive cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, which is fully in line with the interests of both countries and the interests of peace and socialism, and there are now objective conditions for realizing this desire.

In discussing the various issues that were the subject of the talks, the two governments proceeded from the following principles with the aim of strengthening international trust and cooperation:

	Peace is indivisible, and collective security can only be established on the basis of peace;

	In their relations with each other and with other countries, the two countries shall respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and mutual equality of other countries;

	Recognizing and developing peaceful coexistence between nations, regardless of differences in ideologies and social systems, means cooperation between countries in general international relations, particularly in economic and cultural fields;

	Mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs for any reason (economic, political, or ideological). Because the issue of domestic systems, the differences in social systems, and the different specific forms of developing socialism are matters for the people of each country themselves;

	Developing bilateral and international economic cooperation to eliminate all factors in economic relations that hinder the exchange of goods and impede the development of productive forces in the world and within the economic scope of each country;

	Providing assistance to countries and economically underdeveloped regions through the relevant bodies of the United Nations and in other ways that conform to the principles of the United Nations, in the interests of the development of the peoples of these regions and the world economy;

	Ending the dissemination of distrust and any form of propaganda, misreporting, and other actions that in any way impede the creation of constructive international cooperation and an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence among nations;

	Condemning any aggression and any attempt to establish political and economic control over other countries;

	Believing that the policy of military blocs exacerbates international tensions, undermines trust between peoples, and deepens the threat of war.

(2)

The policy of the two governments proceeds from the principles of the United Nations Charter. Both sides agreed that further efforts must be made to strengthen the role and prestige of the United Nations, which will be particularly affirmed by granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate status in the United Nations. It is equally important to accept all countries that meet the requirements of the United Nations Charter as members of this organization.

The two governments agreed that the peoples of all countries should make new efforts to achieve positive results and agreements in negotiations on such important world issues. These issues are: the reduction and limitation of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, the establishment of universal collective security, including a European collective security system based on treaties, and the issue of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

Through such efforts, an atmosphere can be created in which many pressing international issues can be resolved peacefully, such as the resolution of the German question on a democratic basis in accordance with the wishes and interests of the German people and in accordance with the interests of universal security, and the satisfaction of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China over Taiwan.

The two governments welcomed the results of the Bandung Conference, considering it a significant contribution to the idea of international cooperation, a support for the efforts of the peoples of Asian and African countries to strengthen their political and economic independence, and believing that all this contributes to the consolidation of world peace.

(3)

Great importance was attached to the analysis of the current relations between the two countries and the prospects for the future development of relations between the two countries. Taking into account the significant inconsistencies in the relations between the two countries in recent years, which have caused damage to both parties concerned and to international cooperation, the governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia express their determination to develop future relations in a spirit of friendly cooperation and, based on the principles set forth in this declaration, agree on the following points:

	1. The two countries will take all necessary measures to establish a normal treaty status. On this basis, they will adjust and ensure the normal development of relations in order to expand cooperation between the two countries in all areas of concern to both governments.

	2. It is necessary to strengthen the economic ties and expand economic cooperation between the two countries.

	To this end, the two governments agree to take all necessary measures to eliminate the consequences of the rupture of the normal treaty status in the economic relations between the two countries.

	The two governments also agree to conclude the necessary treaties to adjust and promote economic relations in the above-mentioned direction.

	3. In order to develop cultural relations, the two governments express their readiness to conclude a cultural cooperation agreement.

	4. The two governments believe that reporting news to the public is of great significance for developing friendly cooperation between nations, and in order to enable the public to obtain accurate and objective news, they agree that it is necessary to conclude a news reporting agreement in the spirit of the United Nations resolution and on the principle of reciprocity regarding the status and privileges of establishing such news reporting agencies in the territory of either contracting party.

	5. The two governments support the United Nations' proposal on cooperation among countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy - which is of great significance for consolidating peace and for the progress of the world - and therefore agree to establish mutual cooperation in this regard.

	6. The two governments agree to take measures to conclude treaties to resolve the issue of nationality or repatriation, respectively, of citizens of one contracting party residing in the territory of the other. The two governments agree that, for personnel related to the above issues, the treaty must be based on respect for humanitarian principles and on the generally recognized principle of voluntariness.

	The two governments also agree to guarantee the exercise of one party's right to protect its citizens in the territory of the other party, which also means guaranteeing citizens the right to retain their nationality before arriving in the territory of the other contracting party.

	7. In the spirit of the peace-loving principles stated in this declaration, and in order for the peoples of the two countries to better know and understand each other, the two governments agree to support and assist social organizations of the two countries to cooperate by establishing contacts, exchanging socialist experiences, and freely exchanging opinions.

	8. The two governments agree that, in order to further develop mutual understanding between the two countries, to develop international cooperation, and to consolidate world peace, they will make the greatest efforts to achieve the tasks and decisions of this declaration.

    由苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员、苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫，苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁，苏联部长会议第一副主席阿·伊·米高扬，苏联最高苏维埃民族院外交委员会主席、苏联共产党中央委员会委员、“真理报”总编辑德·特·谢皮洛夫，苏联外交部第一副部长安·安·葛罗米柯和苏联对外贸易部副部长帕·尼·库米金组成的苏联政府代表团和由南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统约瑟夫·布罗兹·铁托，联邦执行委员会副主席爱·卡德尔，亚·兰科维奇和斯·伏克曼诺维奇—泰波，联邦执行委员会委员米·托多罗维奇，外交秘书长科·波波维奇，外交副秘书长维·米丘诺维奇组成的南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国政府代表团从一九五五年五月二十七日到六月二日在贝尔格莱德和布莱俄尼岛举行了会谈。会谈在友好和互相谅解的气氛中进行。在会谈过程中，双方就苏、南两国所关心的国际问题交换了意见，并且全面地研究了两国政治、经济和文化关系的问题。
    （一）
    会谈的出发点是，两国政府对于用谈判方式来和平解决国际问题并且加强各国人民与各个国家间的合作的共同愿望。
    两国人民和两国武装部队在他们同其他各国爱好自由的人民共同对法西斯侵略者作战的年月中特别增进了彼此的友谊和战斗合作。
    两国政府同意采取进一步的措施，以便使两国的关系正常化和发展两国的合作，两国政府确信：这是符合两国人民利益的，是对缓和紧张局势以及对巩固世界和平事业的一个贡献。在会谈过程中，两国政府对进一步发展苏联和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的全面合作表现了真诚的愿望，这完全符合两国的利益以及和平和社会主义的利益，而且现在也存在着实现这个愿望的客观条件。
    在讨论作为会谈的题目的各项问题时，两国政府本着加强国际信任和合作的目的，从下列原则出发：
    和平不可分割，集体安全只能建立在和平的基础上；
    两国在彼此的关系中以及在同其他国家的关系中都应尊重他国的主权、独立、领土完整和互相平等；
    承认和发展国际间的和平共处，而不问各国间的思想体系的不同和社会制度的不同，这就是指各国在一般国际关系方面特别是在经济和文化方面的合作；
    互相尊重并且互不以任何（经济上的、政治上的或是思想体系上的）理由干涉内政。因为国内制度的问题、社会制度的不同和发展社会主义的具体形式的不同是各国人民自身的事；
    发展双边的和国际的经济合作，消除经济关系中一切妨碍商品交换和阻滞世界上以及在各国经济范围以内的生产力发展的因素；
    通过联合国的相应的机构以及用符合于联合国原则的其他方式对各国的经济以及对经济落后的地区给予帮助，以利于这些地区的人民和世界经济的发展；
    终止散布不信任和在任何方面有碍于造成建设性的国际合作和各国和平共处气氛的任何形式的宣传、错误报道以及其他行动；
  谴责任何侵略和任何对其他国家建立政治和经济控制的企图；
    认为军事集团的政策加剧国际紧张局势，破坏各国人民间的信任和加深战争威胁。
    （二）
    两国政府的政策是从联合国宪章的原则出发的，双方同意必须进一步努力以加强联合国的作用和威信，而这一点将特别由于给予中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位而得到肯定。接受一切符合于联合国宪章要求的国家为这个组织的会员国也是同样重要的。
    两国政府一致认为，各国人民应当作新的努力，争取这一类世界性的重要问题在谈判中取得积极的结果和协议。这一类的问题是：裁减和限制军备以及禁止原子武器建立普遍的集体安全，其中包括以条约为基础的欧洲集体安全体系，以及把原子能用于和平目的的问题。
    经过这种努力，就可以创造一种气氛，使许多头等迫切的国际问题得以和平处理，例如德国问题的按照德国人民的愿望和利益以及按照普遍安全的利益在民主的基础上取得各方都同意的解决，中华人民共和国对台湾的合法权利的满足。
    两国政府欢迎万隆会议的结果，认为这是对国际合作思想的重大贡献，是对亚非各国人民加强自己的政治和经济独立的努力的支持，并且认为这一切有助于巩固全世界的和平。
    （三）
    对两国到目前为止的关系以及两国关系今后发展前途的分析受到了十分重视。考虑到最近几年来两国关系中有很大的不协调，而这点无论是对有关双方或者是对国际合作都造成了损害，苏联和南斯拉夫两国政府表示决心本着友好合作的精神发展今后的关系，并且依据本宣言中所阐明的原则同意下列几点：
    一、两国将采取一切必要措施来建立正常的条约状态，它们将在这个基础上调整和保证关系的正常发展，以便两国在双方政府所关心的一切方面扩大合作。
    二、必须加强两国的经济联系和扩大两国的经济合作。
    为了这一目的，两国政府同意采取一切必要措施来消除由于两国经济关系中正常条约状态的破裂而产生的后果。
    两国政府还同意缔结必要的条约以调整和促进经济关系朝着上述方向发展。
    三、为了发展文化关系，两国政府表示准备缔结一项文化合作公约。
    四、两国政府认为向公众报道消息对发展国际间的友好合作有很大的意义，并且为了使公众能得到确切、客观的消息，一致认为有必要本着联合国决议的精神和关于在缔约国任何一方的领土上设立这种新闻报道机构的地位和特权的互惠原则缔结一项新闻报道公约。
    五、两国政府支持联合国提出的关于各国在和平使用原子能方面进行合作的建议——这对巩固和平、对全世界的进步有重大意义，因此同意在这方面建立相互的合作。
    六、两国政府同意采取措施缔结条约，以便解决关于居住在对方国土上的缔约国一方的公民的国籍，或者相应地遣返的问题。两国政府同意，对于同上述问题有关的人员，条约必须以尊重人道原则和以公认的自愿原则为基础。
    两国政府还同意保证一方行使在对方领土上保护一方公民的权力的行使，这也指保证公民有权保留他们在到达缔约国另一方国土以前的国籍。
    七、两国政府本着本宣言中所陈述的爱好和平的原则的精神，并且为了两国人民更好地互相认识和了解，同意支持和协助两国社会团体通过建立接触、交流社会主义经验和自由交换意见等方式进行合作。
    八、两国政府同意，为了进一步发展两国之间的相互了解，为了发展国际合作和巩固世界和平，将尽最大努力来实现本宣言的任务和决定。
