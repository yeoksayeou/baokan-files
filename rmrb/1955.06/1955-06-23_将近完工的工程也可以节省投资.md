    Projects Nearing Completion Can Still Save Investment
    Wang Pu
    Since the Party Central Committee proposed resolutely lowering the standards of non-productive construction, many construction units have re-examined their construction plans, revised their designs, and proposed specific methods for economizing. Some units have saved more investment than the central government's target. This is a new atmosphere in national construction.
    However, in some units where projects have already started or are nearing completion, some comrades believe that it is too late for them to save money, and they can no longer consider, nor is it easy to consider, lowering standards. They say, "We can't tear down the houses that have been built." "Let the past be the past, we will correct it in the future." "It is too late to regret, let's not do it again!"
    Of course, there is indeed no need to tear down houses that have already been built. It is more difficult to consider lowering construction standards when a project has already started or is nearing completion than it is to lower construction standards before the project has even started. But this does not mean that these projects cannot lower construction standards.
    The worker dormitory project of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau is nearing completion. Initially, the comrades in the Mining Bureau's design office also felt that there was no way to modify the design or save money. Later, the leading staff of the Mining Bureau said to them: "Many dormitories have been built to the roof. The biggest workload in the future is plastering the walls. Think about it, is there a problem with the plastering design?" At this time, some people still thought that the walls had to be plastered anyway, so what could be the problem. Later, after the design office carefully studied and learned the method of plastering walls by farmers, it proved that even the plastering design could be modified and saved. According to the original design, the plastering project used white lime hemp plaster and then a layer of white wash. Later, it was changed to a layer of wheat straw mud and then a layer of white lime hemp plaster, which reduced the cost by four yuan and nine jiao per square meter. The dormitories built this year by the Fengfeng Mining Bureau's State-owned Mines No. 1, No. 2, No. 4 and the Mining Headquarters alone can save more than 82,000 yuan in investment after adopting this method.
    Of course, the plastering project is just one example. There are also many places to save money in the installation of other facilities such as water, electricity, heating and sanitation, and in the selection of doors, windows and various small hardware materials. For example, removing the heating equipment in places where heating is not needed can reduce the cost by eight yuan per square meter. Some projects have return water equipment in their heating equipment, and simply removing the return water equipment can reduce the cost by sixteen yuan per square meter. For another example, changing wooden floors to cement floors can reduce the cost by two yuan per square meter. As for changing the brass handles on doors to other substitutes and changing steel windows to wooden windows, a lot of money can also be saved. Therefore, even if the houses are almost built and the project is nearing completion, there are still many ways to lower the standards. Recently, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, in its deployment of comprehensive savings, first considered how to modify the doors, windows, sanitation, heating equipment, as well as the interior and exterior painting, flooring, and roof of these projects that have already started and those that are about to start, without changing the building structure, so as to ensure that these projects can still meet the prescribed cost reduction targets.
      Those who believe that it is impossible to save money when a project is nearing completion have not deeply understood the spirit of the central government's policy of comprehensive savings, and are not resolute and thorough in implementing the central government's instructions to lower the standards of non-productive construction. This reserved attitude must be resolutely changed. All non-productive construction projects that have already started, or even are nearing completion, must also lower standards and reduce costs as much as possible, and save the country's construction funds in this last opportunity.

### 将近完工的工程也可以节省投资

    将近完工的工程也可以节省投资
    王朴
    党中央提出坚决降低非生产性建筑的标准以后，很多建筑单位都重新审查了建筑计划，修改了设计，提出了节约的具体办法。有些单位节约的投资，已超过中央的指标。这是国家建设中的新气象。
    可是，在一些工程已经开始或一些工程已将近完工的单位中，有一些同志认为，对他们说来，节约已来不及了，他们可以不再考虑、也很难再考虑降低标准。他们说：“总不能把垒起来的房子再拆掉。”“过去的就算过去了，今后改正就是。”“悔之已晚，下不为例吧！”
    当然，已经垒起来的房子，的确用不着再拆掉它。在工程已经开始，甚至将近完工的时候，再来考虑降低建筑标准，比之工程还没有开始时就降低建筑标准也是困难一些。但这决不等于这些工程就不可能降低建筑标准。
    峰峰矿务局的职工宿舍工程已经接近完工了。最初，矿务局设计室的同志们也是觉得没有办法修改设计，没有办法节约的。后来矿务局的领导工作人员对他们说：“很多宿舍都盖到房顶了，今后最大的工作量是抹墙，你们考虑考虑，抹墙的设计是不是有问题。”这时也还有人认为墙反正得抹，还能有什么问题。后来经过设计室认真研究、学习农民盖房子抹墙的方法，证明就是抹墙工程的设计，也有可以修改、可以节约的地方。按照原来的设计，抹墙工程中抹了白灰麻刀泥，还要刷一层大白。后来改为抹一层麦秸泥，再抹一层白灰麻刀泥，这就使每平方公尺的造价降低四元九角。仅峰峰矿务局国营一矿、二矿、四矿和矿本部今年修建的宿舍，采用这个办法后就可以节省投资八万二千多元。
    抹墙工程当然还只是一个例子。其他如水、电、暖气和卫生设备的安装，门、窗及各种小五金器材的选用上，也有许多可以节省的地方。例如在可以不用暖气的地方取消暖气设备，每平方公尺的造价可以降低八元。有些工程的暖气设备中还有回水设备，单取消回水设备，每平方公尺的造价可以降低十六元。再如把木地板改成水泥地面，每平方公尺的造价可以降低二元。至于把门上的铜把手改成其他代用品，把钢窗改成木窗，也可以节省很多钱。因此，即使是房子都快垒起来了，工程将近完工了，还是有很多办法可以降低标准的。最近，建筑工程部在布置全面节约中，首先就是考虑已经开工的工程和马上就要开工的工程，如何在不改变建筑结构的情况下，修改这些工程的门窗、卫生、采暖设备，以及室内外的粉刷、地板、屋顶等部分的设计，以保证这些工程仍能达到规定的降低造价的指标。
      那些认为工程将近完工就不能节约的人，实际上是没有深刻领会中央关于全面节约的方针的精神，对贯彻中央降低非生产性建筑标准的指示不坚决，不彻底，这种有所保留的态度必须坚决改变。一切已经开工、乃至将近完工的非生产性建筑工程也必须尽可能降低标准、降低造价，在这最后的机会里节省国家的建设资金。
