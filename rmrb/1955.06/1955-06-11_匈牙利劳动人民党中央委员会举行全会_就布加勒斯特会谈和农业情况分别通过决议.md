Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 10th: According to a Hungarian News Agency report, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party held a plenary session on June 7th and 8th, discussing and approving the report by Hegedüs on the tasks of future socialist transformation of agriculture and increasing agricultural production, and the report by Rákosi on the talks held in Bucharest by representatives of the Soviet Union, Romania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. The plenary session also passed resolutions on these two reports.

The resolution on the Bucharest talks stated that the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party hopes and believes that, due to the joint declaration of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, sound, sincere, and friendly cooperative relations will be established between other countries of the socialist camp and Yugoslavia. The resolution emphasized that the Hungarian Working People's Party will strive in every way and with all its strength to establish and strengthen sound and sincere friendly relations between the Hungarian People's Republic and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as between their peoples, as soon as possible.

The resolution on the agricultural situation pointed out that the tasks in agriculture are: first, to develop the cooperative movement on a voluntary basis so that socialist elements will dominate agriculture by the end of the second Five-Year Plan; and second, to increase agricultural production and make it more economically sound. The resolution called on all party members, especially those in rural areas, to make unremitting efforts to accomplish these tasks. The resolution requested two hundred activists (capable of providing guidance, politically advanced, and excellent organizers) to assist in rural work.
