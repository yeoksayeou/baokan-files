    Farmers in the mountainous areas of Xingtai Prefecture Cultivate Fruit Trees
    On the basis of being organized, farmers in the mountainous areas of Xingtai Prefecture, Hebei Province, have begun to cultivate a large number of fruit trees in a planned way by utilizing barren hills and wastelands. This year, the eleven districts in the mountainous parts of the prefecture have sown 14,600 mu of walnuts and transplanted 21,800 mu of two-year-old walnut seedlings to orchards. In the past two years, the three mountainous districts of Xingtai County have cultivated more than 700 mu of various fruit tree nurseries. This spring, more than 50,000 walnut seedlings have been transplanted to the mountains. In the fifth district, one village, Fangjiapu, transplanted more than 10,000 seedlings. The Dongchuankou Agricultural Production Cooperative, with only 60 households, planted 3,000 walnut trees. In order to cultivate orchards, mountainous areas have also launched a terracing movement. Now many fruit trees have been planted in the newly built terraces.
