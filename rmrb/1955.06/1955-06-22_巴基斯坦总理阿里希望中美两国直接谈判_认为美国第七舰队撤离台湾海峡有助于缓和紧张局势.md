Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th -- The "Hindu" newspaper reported from Calcutta on the 18th that Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali suggested that the United States and the People's Republic of China should hold talks at the highest level—probably at the foreign minister level—to resolve the tense situation in the Taiwan area and take general steps to ease international tensions. Ali made these remarks to reporters on the 18th while passing through Calcutta airport on his way from Karachi to Dhaka.

Muhammad Ali said that the world situation has greatly improved since the Bandung Conference. He said that an important factor in promoting the easing of tensions in the region and the general improvement of the world situation was the successful conclusion of the Bandung Conference.

In response to how to eliminate the current tensions, Ali said that there were many reasons for these tensions. However, he pointed out that the complete restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, the withdrawal of the Kuomintang from the coastal islands of China, and the withdrawal of the US Seventh Fleet from the Taiwan Strait would help ease tensions.

He said, "We all long for a satisfactory solution to be found. Threats to world peace must be avoided, so it is absolutely necessary to find comprehensive solutions to all these problems."

    巴基斯坦总理阿里希望中美两国直接谈判
    认为美国第七舰队撤离台湾海峡有助于缓和紧张局势
    新华社新德里二十日电　“印度教徒报”记者十八日从加尔各答发的消息说，巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里建议：美国和中华人民共和国应在最高级——大概是在外长级——举行会谈来解决台湾地区的紧张局势和普遍采取步骤来缓和国际紧张局势。阿里是在十八日从喀喇蚩去达卡途中经过加尔各答机场时对记者说的。
    穆罕默德·阿里说，现在世界形势已比万隆会议以前大大改善了。他说，促进这个地区紧张局势的缓和以及世界形势的普遍改善的一个重要因素，是万隆会议的胜利结束。
    在回答如何消除目前紧张局势时，阿里说，造成这种紧张局势是有许多原因的。但是，他指出，完全恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位、国民党从中国沿海岛屿撤退和美国第七舰队撤离台湾海峡将会帮助缓和紧张局势。
    他说：“我们大家都渴望一定能找到令人满意的解决办法。对世界和平的威胁必须避免，因此，绝对有必要在所有这些问题上找出全面的解决办法。”
