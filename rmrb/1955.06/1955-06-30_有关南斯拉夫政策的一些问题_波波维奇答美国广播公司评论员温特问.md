Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, June 27th: Yugoslav Foreign Secretary Popović answered some questions raised by William Winter, a commentator for the American Broadcasting Company.

    Winter asked whether Yugoslavia intended to make any changes to its foreign policy after the visit of Soviet representatives to Yugoslavia. Popović replied: There is no need to make any changes. The Belgrade talks are a practical application of Yugoslavia's foreign policy principles aimed at consolidating peace and strengthening good relations with all countries with the same desire. The Soviet-Yugoslav talks and their final declaration are undoubtedly a major contribution to the consolidation of universal peace.

    In response to a question about whether the new developments in Soviet-Yugoslav relations would affect the internal development of Eastern European countries, Popović said: Like the internal development of other countries, the internal development of Eastern European countries is and should be their internal affair.

    Winter asked whether Yugoslavia would feel less secure if the proposal for the neutralization of Germany were accepted and American troops were required to withdraw from German territory. Popović replied: I am unwilling to interpret the policies of other countries, especially to answer such hypothetical questions. However, I do not believe that this hypothetical proposal will be accepted, and the possibility of this plan being implemented is even smaller. But if, through joint efforts, international relations are improved and peace is guaranteed, Yugoslavia and other countries will feel very secure.

    In response to the question of whether Yugoslavia is a communist country, Popović said: Yugoslavia is an independent country and an equal member of the United Nations. The people of Yugoslavia have decided, according to their own will, to develop Yugoslavia into a socialist country, or, if you like, a communist country, and they are doing so in their own way. Popović added that we do not tend to divide regimes, let alone countries, into two categories such as capitalist and communist. Such a simple classification using labels that are not fully understood by everyone cannot correctly explain or illustrate the full complexity and differences of the existing social systems in the world. We are particularly unwilling to agree with this approach if it means that lasting peaceful coexistence and cooperation between different social systems is impossible.

    有关南斯拉夫政策的一些问题
    波波维奇答美国广播公司评论员温特问
    新华社二十八日讯　据塔斯社贝尔格莱德二十七日讯：南斯拉夫外交秘书长波波维奇回答了美国广播公司评论员威廉·温特提出的一些问题。
    温特问，在苏联代表访问南斯拉夫以后，南斯拉夫的外交政策是否打算作任何改变？波波维奇回答说：不需要作任何改变。贝尔格莱德会谈是南斯拉夫旨在巩固和平、同一切具有同样愿望的国家巩固彼此间的良好关系的外交政策原则的实际运用。苏南会谈及其最后宣言无疑是对巩固普遍和平的一个重大贡献。
    波波维奇在回答关于苏南关系中的新发展会不会影响东欧各国的内部发展的问题时说：同其他国家的内部发展一样，东欧各国的内部发展是而且应该是它们内部的事情。
    温特问，如果德国中立化的建议被接受，美国军队被要求撤出德国领土，南斯拉夫是否会觉得没有以前那样安全呢？波波维奇回答说：我不愿意解释其他国家的政策，特别是答复这种假设的问题。然而，我不以为这个假设的建议是会被接受的，这种计划能够执行的可能性就更小了。但是如果通过共同的努力，使国际关系获得改善，和平得到保障，南斯拉夫和其他国家就将会感到非常安全。
    波波维奇在回答南斯拉夫是不是共产主义国家的问题时说：南斯拉夫是一个独立的国家，联合国的一个平等的会员国。南斯拉夫人民按照自己的意志决定把南斯拉夫发展为一个社会主义国家，或者，如果你喜欢的话，一个共产主义国家，而且他们正在按照自己的方式这样作。波波维奇又说，我们不倾向于把政权、更不要说把国家分为譬如资本主义的和共产主义的两类。这样一种以各人了解不尽相同的标签来简单分类的办法，并不能正确地解释或是说明世界上现有的社会制度的全部复杂性和区别。我们特别不愿意同意这种办法，如果这种办法意味着不同的社会制度之间不可能保持持久的和平共处和合作的话。
