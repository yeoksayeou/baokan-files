Peace is the Common Language of All Peoples
—On the Eve of the Helsinki World Peace Congress
Zi Gang

The World Peace Congress, with the participation of representatives from a wide range of strata in various countries, is about to open here—in Helsinki, the beautiful capital of Finland. This is another grand gathering of international significance because its topic is peace, peace that is as necessary to people as air, sunshine, and water, peace that is needed by newborn infants and by the elderly who have worked their entire lives and wish to live out their twilight years in tranquility. Therefore, it attracts the attention of people all over the world.

I know that today, billions of people around the world are yearning for the center of this "Land of a Thousand Lakes"—Finland. In this clear and bright capital city of 400,000 people, more than two thousand representatives from over ninety countries are gathering to promote world peace.

Although the United States held an atomic exhibition here last month and British warships sometimes come to visit, there is an atmosphere of peace here. The Finnish people deeply understand the value of peace because of the painful lessons they have learned from war. Their unanimous demand is that Finland not participate in wars but develop trade and cultural exchanges with all countries. Finland can supply foreign countries with high-quality timber, pulp, and cheese; at the same time, its underground resources are scarce, and it needs to import many things from foreign countries.

The southern and western parts of Finland are coastal lowlands, exposed to the sea. Soon there will be a fountain in Helsinki, symbolizing the city emerging from the seabed. Perhaps people visiting there will have a feeling of a beautiful myth about fairies coming from the Dragon Palace! In Helsinki, it is difficult to distinguish between rural and urban areas. It is said that there are 1.8 million cattle in the country, as for how many trees there are, it is difficult to count. Saying it is dense or lush is not accurate; newcomers will have this feeling: the city was opened up from a vast sea of trees. In addition to the famous Parliament Building, the Academy of Sciences Building, the Lutheran Nicholas Church, the Greek Church Cathedral, and the National Museum, the city is dotted with forest research institutes, botanical research institutes, and flower gardens. Whether in the city or in the suburbs, there are rocks from the seabed everywhere, and squirrels are as common as birds, jumping around on pine trees and playing in the grass, appearing not afraid of people at all.

This Finland, known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," actually has no fewer than 35,000 lakes of all sizes. Upon entering Finnish territory from the Soviet-Finnish border, the train often runs alongside mirror-like lakes. The Finns pride themselves on being proficient in swimming. In coastal cities like Helsinki, on average, one in every two adults owns a light wooden boat. Some people commute to work by boat on weekdays and take tents out for excursions on holidays.

Peace is the common aspiration, the common language, and the medium of emotional exchange of all peoples. The representatives from Vietnam, Japan, and New Zealand attending the World Peace Congress who were on the same train from Beijing as us got along very well with us. At the welcome ceremonies in Beijing-Moscow's major stops and in Leningrad, besides bouquets of flowers, how much encouragement and blessing did we receive? It's really hard to remember. Workers, students, women, artists... are all active workers in the peace movement. The Young Pioneers of Molotov City were also unwilling to give up the opportunity to say a few words on stage. Some women spoke of peace with tears in their eyes. Needless to say, memories of wartime scenes touched them.

During our one-day stay in Moscow, we not only visited the Lenin and Stalin Mausoleums, but also visited the large-scale Agricultural Exhibition and toured Moscow University, with its thirty-two-story building on Lenin Hills and twenty-two thousand students. Even more precious was that Zoya's mother was with us from morning till night. When talking about the war, what appeared between her brows was more than just gnashing hatred! When talking about her heroic daughter and son, talking about her books, no one would feel that she was a stranger but would feel as if they had known her for a long time. She embraced Chinese peace workers. She kissed the brave Vietnamese female guerrillas with tears in her eyes. She left a message for everyone who asked her to sign: to work hard in their own positions to serve the realization of peace on earth. None of us can forget her tall figure in black clothes and a gray coat standing on the platform of the Moscow train station.

Just arriving at Vainikkala, the first station in Finland, the train stayed for two hours, and we "chatted" with the staff and children on the platform. Saying "chat" is not accurate, because they don't understand Chinese, and they can't find anyone who understands other languages. But when they heard clearly that we were going to Helsinki, they understood, and in a few words we learned the Finnish word for "peace": "Rauha."

With peace, with "Rauha," emotions are exchanged, learning to sing to each other, those children with flaxen hair and brightly colored clothes are not afraid of strangers either.

When the train arrived in Helsinki at more than eleven o'clock at midnight, the sky was not completely dark yet. The sun had just set on the Gulf of Finland, and the afterglow of the sunset reflected a reddish hue on the horizon. People from the Finnish-Chinese Friendship Association welcomed us with the Chinese words "Long live Finnish-Chinese friendship!" and "Hello!" We also tried to say "Rauha," and thus we also felt like we had known each other for a long time.

The venue of the World Peace Congress is in the former Exhibition Hall. Finnish workers are rushing to prepare for the congress. There is a tall pine tree on the rostrum, with a small wooden bird's nest on it, and more than a hundred peace doves made of wood chips flying on the roof. The list of the presidium will be passed at the opening ceremony. Joliot-Curie will speak. Today, the Finnish "People's Labor News" published an editorial welcoming this congress, congratulating it on discussing without prejudice how to maintain and strengthen issues of common interest to all countries and nations. It expressed its satisfaction that the congress would acknowledge that different economic systems and different worldviews can coexist peacefully, and believed that the desire to ease the international situation fully conformed to the greatest interests of their small country.

The fact is that Finland is a country that trades with sixty or seventy countries in the world, and it is difficult for it to survive without peace. Many countries and peoples with different socio-political systems and different ideologies in the world can and should coexist peacefully. Apart from the warmongers, everyone will agree with the topics of this conference: disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, opposition to military blocs, the establishment of international cooperation, national independence and peace, economic and cultural exchanges between countries, and cooperation and activities between peace movements in various countries.

Cultural exchange includes scientific, literary, and sports exchanges, as well as exchange trips, and also includes the issue of youth education. How broad and far-reaching this implication is! When people talk about the common cultural achievements of mankind, it will arouse mutual respect. When we travel to each other's countries, we will feel that other people's countries are also very lovely. This is true in terms of the precious cultural traditions of various countries, in terms of the natural environment, and in terms of pure young people and children. Isn't it a beautiful wish for the people of all countries to exchange emotions, exchange intelligence and creative experiences?

Yes, such a wish can be realized, and the army of peace defenders is growing stronger and stronger. This conference is proof of that. In order to defend the cause of peace and eliminate the threat of new wars that are growing, what is needed now is the strengthening of the unity of the people of all countries and the further expansion of the movement to defend peace. People believe that this conference will make a huge contribution in this regard.

    和平是各国人民共同的语言
    ——赫尔辛基世界和平大会前夕
    子冈
    包括各国极广泛阶层的代表人物参加的世界和平大会就要在这里——芬兰的美丽都城赫尔辛基开幕了。这是国际间又一次盛会，因为它的议题是和平，是空气、阳光、水一样为人们所需要的和平，是刚出生的婴儿到劳动了一生、愿意安度晚年的老人所需要的和平，因此它吸引全世界人民的注意。
    我知道，今天世界上有多少亿人民在向往着这个“千湖之国”——芬兰的中心，在这个有四十万人口的明净都城，今天有九十多个国家的两千多代表为推进世界和平而会聚一堂。
    虽然美国上月在这里举行过原子展览会，英国军舰也有时来访问，这里却有着和平气氛。芬兰人民由于经历过战争的痛苦教训而深切体会和平的可贵。他们一致的要求是，芬兰不参加战争而同各国发展贸易和文化交流。芬兰能供给外国优质的木材纸浆和乳酪；同时它的地下资源缺乏，需要从外国输入许多东西。
    芬兰的南部和西部是沿海低地，露出海面。不久在赫尔辛基将有一处喷泉，象征这个城市从海底涌出。人们在那里游览或许会有一种仙女来自龙宫的美丽神话的感觉吧！在赫尔辛基，村区和市区难以分辨。全国据说有牛一百八十万头，至于有树多少就难计数了，说是茂密或者葱郁都不确切；初来的人会有这个感觉：城市是从茫茫树海中开辟出来的。城中除了著名的国会大厦、科学院大厦、路德新教的尼古拉教堂、希腊教会的大礼拜堂、国立博物馆外，还点缀着森林研究所、植物研究所和花圃。无论在市区或在郊外，到处是海底的岩石，而松鼠像雀鸟一样普遍地在松树上跳来跳去，在草堆里玩耍，显得一点也不怕人的样子。
    这号称“千湖之国”的芬兰，实际上有大小湖泊不下三万五千个。从苏联芬兰交界处一入芬兰国境，火车就不时地开驰在明镜一样的湖泊旁边。芬兰人以熟谙水性自豪。在赫尔辛基这样的沿海城市，成年人平均每两个人中就有一只轻便的小木船。有人在工作日驾了船上班下班，假日带了帐篷摇船出外旅行。
    和平是各国人民共同的愿望，共同的语言，感情的交流器。同车自北京来的越南、日本、新西兰的出席世界和平大会的代表们和我们都很融洽。在北京——莫斯科的沿线大站和列宁格勒的欢迎会上，除了大束大束鲜花，我们接受了多少鼓舞和祝福呢？实在记不清了。工人、学生、妇女、艺术家……都是积极的和平运动工作者。莫洛托夫城的少年先锋队队员们也不愿放弃到台上来说两句话的机会。有些妇女是含泪谈到和平的。不用说是对战时情景的回忆触痛她们了。
    在莫斯科停留的一天，我们不只谒见了列宁、斯大林陵墓，也参观了规模宏大的农业展览馆，游览了列宁山上三十二层高楼、拥有二万二千学生的莫斯科大学。更可珍贵的是，卓娅的母亲自早到晚和我们在一起，谈起战争来，在她眉宇间浮现的何止切齿的痛恨！谈起她英雄的女儿和儿子，谈起她的书，任何人也不会觉得她是陌生人而是一见如故。她拥抱中国和平工作者。她含着热泪亲吻越南的英勇的女游击队员。她留言给每一个要她签字的人：要在自己的岗位上努力为和平在人间实现而服务。我们谁也忘怀不了在莫斯科车站站台上站着的她的穿玄色衣衫外罩灰大衣的高大的身影。
    刚抵达芬兰第一站梵茵卡拉，火车有两小时勾留，我们同站台上的工作人员和孩子“闲谈”。说“闲谈”还不确切，因为他们不懂中国话，也找不到懂其他国家语言的人。但是当听清我们是往赫尔辛基去的时候，他们明白了，三言两语我们就学会了“和平”两个字的芬兰话：“劳乌哈”。
    有了和平，有了“劳乌哈”，感情交流了，彼此学着唱歌，那些有着亚麻色头发、穿了鲜艳衣衫的孩子们也不怕生人了。
    当火车在午夜十一时多到达赫尔辛基时，天色犹未全黑，芬兰湾海面上太阳方落，晚霞在地平线上映着晕红。芬中友好协会的人们用中国话“芬中友好万岁！”和“您好！”来欢迎我们。我们也试着说“劳乌哈”，于是也一见如故了。
    世界和平大会会址在前博览会大楼中。芬兰工人们在为大会赶工。主席台上有高大的松树一棵，上面还有木头小鸟巢一个，屋顶上飞翔着用木片扎成的和平鸽一百多只。开幕式上要通过主席团名单。约里奥·居里要发言。今天芬兰“劳动人民报”发表社论，欢迎这个大会，祝贺在这个会上无成见地讨论如何维护和加强对各国和各民族都有共同利益的问题。它为大会会承认不同的经济制度和不同的世界观可以和平共处而表示欣慰，并且认为缓和国际局势这一愿望完全符合他们小国的最大利益。
    事实就是如此，芬兰是一个和世界上六七十个国家通贸易的国家，没有和平它是难以生存的。世界上有着不同社会政治制度和不同意识形态的许多国家和人民，是可以也应当和平共处的。除了战争贩子们，谁都会赞同这次大会的议题：裁减军备和禁止原子武器，反对军事集团，建立国际合作，民族独立和和平，各国经济文化交流，各国和平运动之间的合作和活动。
    文化交流中包括科学、文学、体育交流和交换旅行，也包括青年教育的问题。这有多么广泛深远的含义！当人们讲述着人类共同的文化成果的时候，会引起彼此间的尊重。当我们到彼此的国家中旅行时，会觉得别人的国家也很可爱。在各国可贵的文化传统方面，在自然环境方面，在纯正的青少年和孩子方面，都是这样。各国人民情感交流，交换聪明才智和创造经验，不是够美好的愿望么？
    是的，这样的愿望是能够实现的，和平保卫者的大军正越来越壮大，这次大会就是一个证明。为了保卫和平事业和消除正在生长的新战争的威胁，现在所需要的就是各国人民的加强团结和更加扩大保卫和平运动。人们相信这次大会定会在这方面作出巨大贡献。
