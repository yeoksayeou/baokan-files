    台湾报纸透露
    胡风早就和蒋贼特务有关系
    新华社二十九日讯　六月二十五日的蒋贼“中央日报”发表了蒋贼立法委员、蒋贼中国文艺协会负责人陈纪滢的一篇文章。这篇文章透露了反革命分子胡风老早就和蒋贼特务有了勾结。陈纪滢是蒋贼的一个文化特务，他曾经是一九五四年八月发起查封台湾十家报纸、杂志的首脑。他的文章中透露说：还在一九三七年，胡风就和他在武汉发生了联系。当时胡风出版的“七月”杂志中的一部分稿件，就是他供给的。一九四一年陈纪滢在重庆大公报编副刊的时候，胡风曾介绍一个编辑给他。陈纪滢在文章中说：在重庆的时候，“尽管有许多人骂胡风，骂他偏颇，自立门户等等，我除了同情外，当时我却钦佩他的为人”。这个蒋贼文化特务并承认他钦佩胡风的理由是因为“他言论严守立场”。
