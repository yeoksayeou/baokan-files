Anshan Iron and Steel Works Creates New Daily Output Record
    On the 12th, workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Works created the highest daily output record since the factory opened, surpassing the record set on March 5th by 1.79%.
    On this day, the iron produced by the ironworkers exceeding the plan for the country was enough to make four to five thousand double-wheeled double-share plows or six to seven hundred harvesters. The quality of the iron was very good, with first-grade steel exceeding the plan by 7.47%, and defective products were eliminated.
    With the help of Soviet experts, the Iron Works workers universally implemented the advanced Soviet steam blasting operation method in each blast furnace, which increased the hot blast temperature and ensured the smooth operation of the blast furnaces.
    On the 13th, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company wrote a letter to all the workers of the Iron Works, congratulating them on this achievement. (Xinhua News Agency)

    鞍钢炼铁厂创日产量新纪录
    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂职工于十二日创造开厂以来日产量的最高纪录，比三月五日所创造的纪录还多百分之一点七九。
    这一天，炼铁工人为国家超计划生产的铁，足可以做四五千台双轮双铧犁或六七百台收割机。铁的质量很好，制钢铁一级品超过计划百分之七点四七，并且消灭了废品。
    炼铁厂的职工在苏联专家帮助下，各高炉普遍推行了苏联蒸气鼓风的先进操作法，提高了热风的温度，保证了高炉的快料顺行。
    十三日，鞍山钢铁公司写信给炼铁厂的全体职工，祝贺他们的这一成就。　　　　（新华社）
