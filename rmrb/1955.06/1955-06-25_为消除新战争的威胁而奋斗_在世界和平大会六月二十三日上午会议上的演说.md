    Striving to Eliminate the Threat of a New War
    ——Speech at the Morning Session of the World Peace Congress on June 23
    Mr. Chairman, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, Guo Moruo, dear friends!

    First, please allow me to convey the best wishes of the 600 million peace-loving Chinese people to the Congress, and through the delegates attending the Congress, to the peace-loving people of all countries; and please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to the host of this Congress – the Finnish people, and wish the peace-loving Finnish nation and people prosperity and happiness.

    The Chinese people wholeheartedly welcome the convening of this World Peace Congress. They see that this World Peace Congress is being held at an important moment when the people of all countries are demanding further easing of international tensions. The various agendas of the Congress generally reflect the characteristics of the current international situation. The Chinese people sincerely hope that this Congress can achieve satisfactory results and lay a more solid foundation to meet the deep desire of the people of all countries to fundamentally eliminate the threat of new wars.

    Since the World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna in December 1952, the movement for lasting peace has made significant achievements. The demand to stop existing wars put forward by the Vienna World People's Peace Congress has been basically realized. The war in Korea and the threat of war expansion in the Indochina Peninsula have long been stopped. The Chinese people are gratified that they, together with the peace-loving people of the world, have made certain contributions to these peace efforts.

    Regarding the current international situation, we fully agree with the analysis made by Chairman Joliot-Curie in his inspiring opening speech, especially in the past few months, which has shown developments favorable to peace.

    I come from Asia, please allow me to introduce the recent events in Asia first.

    As everyone knows, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence first proposed by China and India—mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence—have been recognized and accepted by more and more countries. In April, the successive convening of the historic Asian Countries Conference and the Asian-African Conference, the frequent contacts and mutual visits between government officials of Asian and African countries during this period, the rise of the Japanese people’s nationwide peace movement demanding national independence and opposing atomic warfare, and the heroic struggles of the peoples of the Middle East, North Africa, and Arab countries against colonialism and racial discrimination all demonstrate that the efforts of the peoples of Asian and African countries to maintain peace and respect friendly cooperation relations among themselves have achieved great success.

    The Asian Countries Conference was held in New Delhi from April 6th to 10th, under the enthusiastic hosting and thoughtful arrangements of our dear Indian friends. More than 200 representatives from 16 countries including Cambodia, the Mongolian People's Republic, India, Burma, Ceylon, Japan, Nepal, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Pakistan participated in the conference, including many members of parliament. Although they represented different nationalities, political views, religious beliefs, and classes, they reached a common understanding on all issues discussed at the conference. The conference unanimously adopted resolutions on important issues in the political, cultural, economic, social, and religious fields.

      During the conference, the representatives of the participating countries felt a deep emotional connection between their countries through frequent contacts. They need peaceful coexistence and can unite more closely, because their destinies have been linked together in the past and present. As the conference's "Message to the People of Asia" pointed out: "In the past, we had a long history of connection. We have experienced glorious times... We have also experienced periods of stagnation, exploitation, and national humiliation together... Now we have emerged from the valley, and we millions of people have new impetus and inspiring power in our hearts."

    A week after the Asian Countries Conference, from April 18th to 24th, the Asian-African Conference, initiated by the five countries of the Colombo Conference—India, Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, and Pakistan—was held in Bandung, Indonesia. This conference was organized by senior government officials from 29 Asian and African countries. The delegation of our country, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, participated in the conference. Among these countries, some have established diplomatic relations or are friendly to each other, while some have no relationship at all, or even have estrangement. Needless to say, the leaders of many countries were meeting for the first time at this conference. Despite significant differences in social systems and ideologies, because they have common experiences and aspirations, and because the representatives of most countries adopted an attitude of seeking common ground while reserving differences at the conference, the conference finally overcame the obstruction and sabotage of external forces and achieved a common understanding on many important issues, and made unanimous resolutions.

    The convening of the Asian-African Conference itself has major historical significance. Such a conference without the participation of colonial countries did not exist in the past. It was unimaginable in the past that the leaders of countries that have been or are being oppressed would gather together to discuss and solve international affairs and issues related to their own vital interests. Because in the past, Asian and African countries could not control their own destiny under the shackles of colonialism and could not handle their own problems independently. Now the Asian-African Conference declares that the era—the era in which no problems can be solved without the participation of colonial countries—is over. We will see that this era will end forever in all regions of the world.

    Dear friends, the Asian Countries Conference and the Asian-African Conference are different in nature. One is a people's conference, and the other is a government conference. However, the agreements reached by the two conferences are basically consistent.

    The basic spirit of both conferences is to demand peaceful coexistence and oppose war; to demand universal disarmament and oppose arms expansion and war preparations; to demand the peaceful use of atomic energy and oppose the production, storage, testing, and use of atomic weapons, nuclear weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction; to demand respect for national independence and oppose colonialism; to demand the promotion of normal economic exchanges between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and to oppose embargoes and monopolies exclusively for the service of a major power; to demand the exchange of experiences and mutual learning in science and technology, culture and education, to promote friendly cooperation between nations, and to oppose the so-called "cosmopolitan" cultural aggression and racial discrimination.

    The consistency of these important resolutions precisely shows that the two conferences equally expressed the common aspirations of the Asian and African people, and we believe that these aspirations are also unanimously shared by all peace-loving and kind people in the world. Apart from a very small number of greedy bloodsuckers—those who want to obtain bloody super profits by launching wars or preparing for wars—who is willing to be destroyed themselves and their children? Who is willing to see their nation enslaved and remain in a backward and impoverished situation for a long time?

    We believe that the achievements of the Asian Countries Conference and the Asian-African Conference have contributed to the cause of peace. The agreements reached by these two conferences, especially the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we believe should be the basic principles for further easing international tensions and eliminating the roots of new wars today. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were fully supported at the Asian Countries Conference, and were further expanded into the Ten Principles of Peaceful Coexistence at the Asian-African Conference, but there was no change in the basic spirit. Mr. Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, once said: "We have the right to ask the governments and parliaments of all countries: Why can't these peace principles put forward by India and China in the June 28, 1954 statement become a common program for the people of all countries in the cause of safeguarding and consolidating peace?" Based on the results of the Asian Countries Conference and the Asian-African Conference, the answer to this question should be affirmative. The day before yesterday, the 21st, Marshal Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, also clearly answered this question at a gathering to welcome Indian Prime Minister Nehru: "The Soviet government also agrees with these five principles and believes that these five principles can serve as a common program for the people of all countries in the cause of safeguarding and consolidating peace."

    We believe this is a key issue. If the people and governments of all countries accept the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, then universal disarmament, especially the prohibition of the production, storage, testing, and use of atomic weapons, nuclear weapons, etc., becomes a problem that is not impossible to handle. If national sovereignty is mutually respected, then all colonial measures, the organization of antagonistic military blocs, and military bases established abroad will naturally have to be abolished.

    Dear friends, the achievements of the Asian people in the cause of peace in recent years should be affirmed, but the same or more brilliant achievements are not limited to Asia. The series of facts favorable to the cause of peace that have recently emerged in Europe are undoubtedly a great encouragement to us Chinese and Asian people. The Chinese and Asian people, together with the people of Europe and other countries, are constantly and closely concerned about the situation in Europe, just as they care about the situation in Asia. Peace is indivisible. The peace and security of all regions of the world are like hundreds of rivers flowing to the sea.

    Now please allow me to first congratulate the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty signed by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Austria more than a month ago. Due to the signing of this treaty, the Austrian issue, which had been pending for ten years, has been successfully resolved.

    The successful resolution of the Austrian issue has created favorable conditions, especially for the successful resolution of the German issue. Germany can obviously also embark on a peaceful and independent path that conforms to the wishes of the people and national interests. The Austrian issue was resolved through prior contact between the Soviet Union and Austrian government leaders and consultations between the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Now the Soviet government has notified the West German government, inviting Mr. Adenauer and any representatives the West German government is willing to send to Moscow to jointly consider the issue of establishing direct diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between the two sides. The West German government has also issued a formal statement welcoming this proposal. We hope that this will become a new and good start to solving the German issue. Leading to the solution of the reunification issue that the German people have long hoped for, thereby establishing a unified and peaceful Germany. Needless to say, this will be of great help to ensuring peace and security in Europe and the world. The Chinese people welcome the talks between the Soviet government and the West German government and support the wishes of the German people that conform to their national interests and state interests.

    The achievements of the talks between the leaders of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are also unanimously hailed by the Chinese people. The results of this talk increased mutual understanding between countries, created an atmosphere of mutual trust between countries, had a positive impact on the international situation, and vigorously promoted the cause of peace.

    Here I cannot fail to mention the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed at the Warsaw Conference more than a month ago by eight European countries—the People's Republic of Albania, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the People's Republic of Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the People's Republic of Poland, the People's Republic of Romania, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Czechoslovak Republic. The Chinese people fully support this treaty. This treaty is a necessary action taken by the contracting states to strengthen their defense capabilities and safeguard peace in Europe and the world under the serious threat of armed aggression inevitably caused by the North Atlantic Treaty and the Paris Agreement. This treaty is completely different from the treaties of antagonistic military blocs. The provisions of the treaty have been made as clear as possible. It reaffirms in its preamble that the contracting states hope to establish a European collective security system on the basis of the participation of all countries in Europe. It does not exclude any country. The treaty stipulates that all other countries, regardless of their social and state systems, can join this treaty; and stipulates that this treaty will become invalid from the date of entry into force of the All-Europe Treaty. It is obvious that this treaty has nothing in common with the treaties of antagonistic military blocs. As is well known, the North Atlantic Treaty refuses the Soviet Union to participate.

    Here, I cannot fail to mention the Soviet government's proposal on May 10 regarding the issue of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of new wars. This proposal detailed and thoughtfully put forward the necessary conditions and specific plans that should be created to achieve broad disarmament. If countries can reach an agreement on the basis of this proposal, it will relieve the broad masses of people of the military burden, allow the people of all countries to enjoy a peaceful and peaceful life, and avoid the catastrophe of new wars. The people of the world are waiting for the governments of all countries to respond to this proposal. We hope that our conference can study this proposal and effectively launch public opinion to urge the governments of all countries to reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of new wars as soon as possible.

    We Chinese people are willing to do our utmost for this, especially to oppose atomic warfare. Here, I would like to report that, in response to the World Peace Council's call to oppose atomic warfare this January, 405,059,997 people in our Chinese people signed the Appeal to the People of the World.

    Dear friends, we believe that this series of facts in Europe that are favorable to the cause of peace are the brilliant results caused by the strong will of the people of European countries to demand peace. This is a victory for the people of European countries, and also a common victory for all peace-loving people in the world.

    Public opinion based on the will of the people has great power. The summit meeting of great powers that the people have consistently demanded for many years will be initially realized.

    On July 18, the heads of government of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France will hold a meeting in Geneva, which is undoubtedly a development in the international situation that is conducive to peace. We Chinese people hope that the summit meeting of the four countries can contribute to the cause of peace. Many problems cannot be solved by one meeting. We hope that such meetings can be held more than once. We also do not hope that the heads of government of various countries will solve one fragmented problem after another, but should lay the foundation on fundamental principles and open up a broad road for peaceful consultation.

      Another noteworthy event in international affairs is the tenth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter. During our conference, the leaders of many countries are gathering in San Francisco for commemoration. The purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are worth commemorating. As one of the founding countries of the United Nations, the Chinese people have always supported the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. But it is very regrettable to us that the United Nations Charter has been repeatedly trampled on. Many unfair resolutions of the United Nations have been passed under the manipulation of individual countries. In particular, what cannot but arouse people's anger is that the United Nations has even been used as a tool to carry out a war of aggression against Korea. The legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China, which represents 600 million people, has been deprived for more than five years, and it has been occupied by a small group of traitors of Chiang Kai-shek, who are spurned by the Chinese people. There are still many countries in the world that are also being rejected outside the gates of the United Nations. On this tenth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, we cannot but express our greatest regret for the United Nations' own violation of the United Nations Charter. We hope that the United Nations can strictly abide by the Charter and play its due role as an organization for peaceful consultation among the people of all countries in the world.

    We read President Eisenhower's congratulatory message to the United Nations General Assembly on the 20th. He is calling for efforts for world peace, and is also talking about the peaceful use of atomic energy. He encourages everyone to come forward with sincerity to welcome the "new dawn." That was a very beautiful speech, very clever in rhetoric. But when reading this beautiful speech, one cannot but be reminded of many not-so-beautiful realities. I am reminded of the astronomical military expenses of the United States. I am reminded that the US government is actively producing atomic weapons and nuclear weapons and is constantly conducting disastrous tests. I am reminded that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, which the US government participated in in mid-December last year, publicly announced that it would conduct atomic warfare. I am reminded that the United States has about a thousand military bases around the world. I am even more reminded that the US armed forces have invaded and occupied our Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, which are 11,000 kilometers away from the United States. When I think of these realities, the "dawn" that President Eisenhower wants to evoke in my spirit has a feeling of dusk instead.

    It is also necessary to seriously solve hunger. A full bottle of beautiful flowers is not as good as a plate of boiled potatoes.

    I mentioned the Taiwan issue here. Please allow me to briefly explain.

    The Taiwan issue is the focus of the current tension in Asia, which is the issue that peace-loving friends are most concerned about.

    Regarding this issue, our Premier Zhou Enlai said in a speech to the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on May 13 after returning to Beijing from Bandung: "Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the people living in Taiwan are Chinese people. The liberation of Taiwan by the Chinese people is China's internal affair. The United States' occupation of Taiwan has created tension in the Taiwan region, which is an international issue between China and the United States. These two issues cannot be confused. There is no war between China and the United States, and there is no so-called ceasefire issue. The Chinese and American people are friendly, and the Chinese people do not want to fight with the United States. In order to ease the tension in the Taiwan region, the Chinese government is willing to sit down and negotiate with the US government. Regarding the form of negotiations, the Chinese government supports the Soviet proposal to convene a ten-nation meeting, and is also willing to consider other forms of negotiations. However, any negotiations cannot affect the Chinese people's exercise of their sovereignty—the just demands and actions to liberate Taiwan; at the same time, the Chinese government cannot agree to the Chiang Kai-shek group participating in any international meetings at any time. There are two possible ways for the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, namely, the way of war and the way of peace. The Chinese people are willing to strive to liberate Taiwan in a peaceful way under possible conditions."

    This is our attitude towards the Taiwan issue. Regarding "sitting down and negotiating with the US government," we are waiting for a clear and sincere response from the US government.

      There is no mistake, "the Chinese and American people are friendly." The American people also love peace, and we have no doubt about that. We remember very clearly that three years ago, when Mr. Eisenhower was running for president, he won many votes because he promised American voters to cease fire in Korea. We believe that President Eisenhower must remember this historical fact very clearly. We also hope that Mr. Dulles, the President's "close friend and colleague," had better not forget it either.

    Dear friends, the will of the people is powerful, and public opinion launched according to the will of the people is powerful. We have constantly called for a ceasefire in Korea, which was finally realized two years ago. We have constantly called for a ceasefire in Indochina, which was finally realized a year ago. We have constantly called for the holding of a great power meeting, which will finally be initially realized in a month. We want to congratulate that international tensions have a tendency to ease. But we have no reason to be satisfied in the slightest, and there is no reason to alleviate the tension of our own work in the slightest. The practitioners of "policy of strength" have not changed their policies. They are still obstructing the realization of the peace aspirations of the people of the world, and are still trying their best to deceive the people in order to maintain the tense situation. In particular, the continuous increase in the production of nuclear weapons has also increased the possibility of sudden incidents. For the happiness of mankind, we must be more vigilant and make further efforts to strive for peace without slackening. We must completely isolate the very few warmongers, comprehensively serve atomic energy for peace, and eliminate war forever.

    The people of the world are expressing such a strong demand. We want to live, to live better, and also to let others live, and let others live better. We must further respect the will of the people, constantly strengthen the power of public opinion, and make unyielding struggles to realize a beautiful world of peaceful coexistence.

    War must be completely eliminated, and peace must win the final victory.

    为消除新战争的威胁而奋斗
    ——在世界和平大会六月二十三日上午会议上的演说
    世界和平理事会副主席  中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长  郭沫若主席先生，亲爱的朋友们！
    首先请允许我把爱好和平的六亿中国人民的最好祝贺转达大会，并通过出席大会的各位代表，带给爱好和平的各国人民；再请允许我特别对这次大会的主人——芬兰人民表示衷心的感谢，祝爱好和平的芬兰国家和人民繁荣和幸福。
    中国人民衷心欢迎这次世界和平大会的召开，他们看到，这次世界和平大会是在各国人民要求进一步缓和国际紧张局势的重要时刻举行的，大会的各项议程总体地反映了目前国际形势的特点，中国人民衷心希望这次大会能够得到美满的成就，能够奠定更加坚实的基础，以满足各国人民对于根本消除新战争威胁的深切愿望。
    自从一九五二年十二月在维也纳举行世界人民和平大会以来，争取持久和平的运动是有重大成就的，维也纳世界人民和平大会所提出的停止现有战争的要求，已经在基本上实现了，在朝鲜和印度支那半岛的战争和战争扩大的威胁，已经早被制止了。中国人民引以自慰的是，他们和世界爱好和平的人民一道在这些和平努力中做出了一定的贡献。
    当前的国际局势，我们完全同意约里奥—居里主席在他的富有启发性的开幕词中的分析，特别是在最近几个月间，呈现出来有利于和平的发展。
    我是从亚洲来的，请允许我首先把亚洲最近事态介绍一下吧。
    如大家所周知，由中国和印度首先倡议的和平共处五项原则——互相尊重主权和领土完整，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处——已经得到了愈来愈多的国家的承认和接受。在四月间，具有历史性的亚洲国家会议和亚非会议的连续召开，亚洲和非洲各国政府要人在这个时期内的频繁接触和互相访问，日本人民要求民族独立、反对原子战争和全国性和平运动的高涨，中近东、北非和阿拉伯人民的反对殖民主义、反对种族歧视的英勇斗争，凡此一切都表明了亚非各国人民为维护和平和尊重彼此间友好合作关系的努力取得了巨大的成就。
    亚洲国家会议是今年四月六日到十日在新德里在我们亲爱的印度朋友热心的主持和周到的安排下召开的。参加会议的有柬埔寨、蒙古人民共和国、印度、缅甸、锡兰、日本、尼泊尔、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国、苏联、埃及、黎巴嫩、约旦、叙利亚、巴基斯坦十六个国家的二百多位代表，其中包括很多的议会议员。虽然他们所代表的民族、政治观点、宗教信仰和阶层各不相同，但在会议所讨论的全部问题上都取得共同的认识。会议一致通过了政治、文化、经济、社会和宗教各方面的重要问题的决议。
      在会议期间与会各国代表通过频繁的接触，大家都感受到彼此国家之间有着深厚的感情上的联系。他们需要和平共处而且能够团结得更加紧密，因为不论在过去和现在他们的命运都是连在一起的。正如会议的“告亚洲人民书”所指出：“过去我们有过悠久的历史联系。我们经历过光荣的时期……我们也一起经历过停滞不前、遭受剥削和民族蒙受耻辱的时期……现在我们已经走出了幽谷，我们千百万人的心中有了新的推动力和使人鼓舞的力量。”
    在亚洲国家会议以后一个星期，就是四月十八日至二十四日，科伦坡会议的五个国家——印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰、巴基斯坦——所创议的亚非会议，在印度尼西亚的万隆召开了。这次会议是有二十九个亚非国家的政府高级负责人所组织起来的。我国以周恩来总理为首的代表团参加了这次会议。这些国家之间，有的是建立了外交关系，或者互相友好的，有的确是什么关系也没有，或者还存在着隔阂的。好些国家的领袖们在这个会议上不用说还是初次见面。尽管在社会制度上和思想意识上有着很显著的差异，但是，由于他们有共同的遭遇和愿望，由于多数国家的代表在会议上采取了求同存异的态度，会议终于在许多重要的问题上克服了外来势力的阻挠和破坏而取得了共同认识，并作出了一致决议。
    亚非会议能够召开，这本身就有重大的历史意义。像这样的没有殖民国家参加的会议是过去所没有的，像这样的受过或者正在受着压迫的国家的领袖们聚集在一起商讨和解决国际大事和同自己切身利益有关的问题是过去所不可想象的。因为过去亚非国家在殖民主义枷锁下不能掌握自己的命运，不能独立自主地处理自己的问题。现在亚非会议宣布这样的时代——没有殖民国家参加就不能解决任何问题的时代已经结束了。我们将要看到这样的时代在世界各个地区都将要永远结束。
    亲爱的朋友们，亚洲国家会议和亚非会议在性质上是有所不同的，一个是人民性的会议，另一个是政府性的会议。但是这两个会议在所获得的协议上却基本上是一致的。
    两个会议的基本精神，都是要求和平共处，反对战争；要求普遍裁减军备，反对扩军备战；要求和平利用原子能，反对原子武器、核子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的生产、储藏、试验和使用；要求尊重民族独立，反对殖民主义；要求在平等互利的基础之上促进国与国之间的正常的经济交流，反对专为某一大国服务的禁运和独占；要求在科学技术、文化教育上交流经验，互相学习，促进民族间的友好合作，反对所谓“世界主义”的文化侵略和种族歧视。
    这些重要决议的一致性正表示两个会议同样表达了亚非人民的共同愿望，这些愿望我们相信也是全世界爱好和平的善良人民所一致共同的。除掉极少数贪婪的吸血者——想靠发动战争或准备战争来获得血腥的超额利润的人之外，谁甘心自己和自己的子女被毁灭？谁甘心自己的民族遭受奴役、长久陷于落后和贫困的境遇呢？
    亚洲国家会议和亚非会议的成就，我们认为对于和平事业是有所贡献的。这两个会议所获致的协议，特别是和平共处的五项原则，我们认为应该是今天进一步缓和国际紧张局势、消除新战争的根源的基本原则。和平共处五项原则在亚洲国家会议上是得到全面支持的，在亚非会议上更扩大成为和平相处的十项原则，但在基本精神上并没有改变。苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫先生曾经说过这样的话：“我们有权利向各国的政府和议会问一句：为什么印度和中国在一九五四年六月二十八日的声明中提出的这几项和平原则，不能成为各国人民在维护和巩固和平的事业中的共同纲领呢？”根据亚洲国家会议和亚非会议的结果，对于这一问题的回答应该是肯定的。前天，二十一日，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁元帅在欢送印度总理尼赫鲁先生的集会上也明确地回答了这个问题：“苏联政府也赞同这五项原则，并认为这五项原则可以作为各国人民在维护和巩固和平的事业中的共同纲领。”
    我们认为这是一个关键性的问题。假如各国人民和政府都接受和平共处五项原则，那末普遍裁减军备，特别是禁止原子武器，核子武器等的生产、储藏、试验和使用便成为不是不能处理的问题。民族主权既得到互相尊重，那末一切殖民主义的措施，对立性的军事集团的组织，国外建立的军事基地等也就自然而然地必须加以废除了。
    亲爱的朋友们，亚洲各国人民近年来在和平事业上的成就是应该肯定的，但同样的或更有光辉的成就，并不限于亚洲。最近在欧洲方面所出现的有利于和平事业的一连串事实，对于我们中国人民和亚洲人民无疑同样是巨大的鼓舞。中国人民和亚洲人民一道，也像欧洲和其他国家人民关心亚洲的局势一样，经常密切地关心着欧洲局势。和平是不能分割的。全世界各地区的和平安全就如像百川殊途而同归于大海。
    现在请允许我先对一个多月以前由苏联、美国、英国、法国和奥地利所签订的奥地利国家条约表示庆贺。由于这个条约的签订，拖延了十年之久悬而未决的奥地利问题获得圆满解决了。
    奥地利问题的圆满解决，特别为圆满解决德国问题创造了有利条件。德国显然也可以同样走上符合于人民愿望和民族利益的和平独立的道路。奥地利问题是通过苏联和奥地利政府领袖事先的接触和苏、美、英、法四国的协商而解决的。现在苏联政府已照会西德政府，邀请阿登纳先生和西德政府愿意派遣的任何代表前往莫斯科共同考虑关于双方之间建立直接的外交、贸易和文化关系的问题。西德政府对这个建议也已经发表了正式声明，表示欢迎。我们希望这将成为解决德国问题的新的良好的开端。导向解决德国人民长期盼望的统一问题，从而建立一个统一和平的德国。这样对于保障欧洲及世界的和平和安全不用说是有很大帮助的。中国人民欢迎苏联政府和西德政府进行会谈，并支持德国人民所怀抱的符合于他们民族利益和国家利益的愿望。
    苏联和南斯拉夫两国领袖会谈的成就同样是中国人民所一致欢呼的。这个会谈的结果增加了国家间的互相谅解，创造了国家间的互相信任的气氛，对于国际局势产生着有利的影响，有力地促进了和平事业。
    在这里我是不能不提到一个多月以前欧洲八个国家——阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、波兰人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和捷克斯洛伐克共和国在华沙会议上所签订的友好合作互助条约。中国人民完全支持这个条约。这个条约是缔约国在严重地受到由北大西洋公约和巴黎协定所必然导致的武装侵略威胁之下，为加强自己的防御力量和保障欧洲和世界和平而采取的必要行动。这个条约完全有别于对立的军事集团的条约。条约的条文已经规定得再明白也没有了。它在开宗明义就重申缔约国希望在欧洲所有国家参加的基础上建立欧洲集体安全体系。它并不排斥任何国家。条约规定所有的其他国家，不问它们的社会和国家制度如何，都可以加入这一条约；并规定这个条约将在全欧条约生效之日起失效。显而易见，这个条约同对立的军事集团的条约没有丝毫相同之处。如所周知，北大西洋公约是拒绝苏联参加的。
    我在这里更不能不提到苏联政府于五月十日提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议。这个建议详细而周到地提出了为实现广泛的裁军所应创造的必要条件和具体方案。各国如果能在这个建议的基础上达成协议，就将解除广大人民的军事负担，使各国人民得到安宁和平的生活，免遭新战争的浩劫。全世界人民在等待着各国政府对这个建议的回答。我们希望我们的大会能够研究这个建议，有效地发动舆论督促各国政府迅速就裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题达成协议。
    我们中国人民是愿为此而尽其最大的努力的，特别是反对进行原子战争。我在这里要附带报告一下，我们中国人民响应世界和平理事会今年一月的反对原子战争的号召，在告全世界人民书上的签名的有四亿零五十万五千九百九十七人。
    亲爱的朋友们，在欧洲方面这一连串有利于和平事业的事实，我们认为，是欧洲各国人民要求和平的强烈意志所导致的辉煌的成果。这是欧洲各国人民的胜利，同时也是全世界爱好和平的人民的共同胜利。
    以人民意志为基础的公众舆论是有强大力量的。多少年来人民所一致要求的大国会议将要得到初步的实现了。
    七月十八日，美、苏、英、法四国政府首脑将要在日内瓦举行会议，这无疑也是国际局势的有利于和平的发展。我们中国人民希望四国政府首脑会议对和平事业能够有所贡献。不少的问题并不是一次会议所能解决的，这样的会议我们希望能够不止一次地召开。我们也并不希望各国政府首脑来解决一个一个的零碎的问题，但应该在根本原则上奠定基础，为和平协商开辟出广阔的道路。
      国际事务中另一个引人注意的事件是联合国宪章的签订满十周年了。在我们大会开会期间，许多国家的领袖们正聚集在旧金山进行纪念。联合国宪章的宗旨和原则是值得纪念的，作为联合国创始国家之一，中国人民一贯支持联合国的宪章的宗旨和原则。但是使我们感到非常遗憾的是，联合国宪章一再被人糟踏。联合国许多不公平的决议是在个别国家操纵之下通过的。特别不能不引起人们愤怒的是：联合国竟曾经被利用为对朝鲜进行侵略战争的工
  具，代表六亿人民的中华人民共和国的合法席位五年多来一直被剥夺，而竟让中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石一小撮卖国集团所霸占。世界上还有好多国家也还被拒绝在联合国大门之外。在这纪念联合国宪章签订十周年的时候，不能不使我们为联合国自己违背了联合国宪章而表示最大的遗憾。我们希望联合国能够严格遵守宪章，发挥它作为世界各国人民和平协商机构的应有作用。
    我们读到了美国总统艾森豪威尔先生二十日在联合国大会上的贺词。他在呼吁着为世界和平而努力，也在谈说着和平利用原子能，他鼓励大家拿出诚意来迎接“新的黎明”。那是一篇十分美丽的演说，在修辞上是很巧妙的。但是读到这篇美丽的演说时，却不能不令人联想到许多不那么美丽的现实。我联想到美国天文数字般的军事费用。我联想到美国政府正在积极生产原子武器和核子武器，并经常不断地在进行灾难性的试验。我联想到去年十二月中旬美国政府所参加了的北大西洋公约组织会议公开宣布要进行原子战争。我联想到美国在全世界各国有一千个左右的军事基地。我更联想到美国的武装部队侵占了离开美国一万一千公里的我们的台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡。我一联想到这些现实，艾森豪威尔总统在我的精神上所要唤起的“黎明”倒反而有了黄昏的感觉了。
    也要认真解决饥饿，满瓶美丽的鲜花倒不如一盘白水煮的洋山芋。
    我在这儿说到了台湾问题。请允许我简单地交代一下。
    台湾问题是目前亚洲紧张局势的焦点，这是爱好和平的友人们所最关心的问题。
    关于这个问题，我们的周恩来总理由万隆回到北京后在五月十三日对中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会扩大会议发表的演说中说：“台湾是中国的领土，生活在台湾的人民是中国的人民，中国人民解放台湾是中国的内政问题。美国侵占台湾造成了台湾地区的紧张局势，这是中美之间的国际问题。这两个问题不能混为一谈。中美之间并没有战争，不发生所谓停火问题。中国人民和美国人民是友好的，中国人民不要同美国打仗。为了和缓台湾地区的紧张局势，中国政府愿意同美国政府坐下来谈判。谈判的形式，中国政府支持苏联提出的召开十国会议的建议，也愿意考虑其它的谈判形式。但是任何谈判都丝毫不能影响中国人民行使自己的主权——解放台湾的正义要求和行动；同时，在任何时候中国政府都不能同意蒋介石集团参加任何国际会议。中国人民解放台湾有两种可能的方式，即战争的方式和和平的方式，中国人民愿意在可能的条件下，争取用和平的方式解放台湾。”
    我们对于台湾问题的态度就是这样。关于“同美国政府坐下来谈判”，我们在等待着美国政府明确而有诚意的回答。
      一点也不错，“中国人民和美国人民是友好的”。美国人民同样爱好和平，我们丝毫也不怀疑。我们还记得很清楚，三年前艾森豪威尔先生在竞选总统的时候是由于对美国选民保证在朝鲜停战而得到了很多选票的。这个历史事实我们相信艾森豪威尔总统一定是记得很清楚的。我们也希望总统先生的“亲近的朋友和同僚”杜勒斯先生最好也不要忘记。
    亲爱的朋友们，人民的意志是有力量的，根据人民的意志所发动的公众舆论是有力量的。我们曾经不断地呼吁朝鲜停战，这终于在两年前实现了。我们曾经不断地呼吁印度支那停战，这终于在一年前实现了。我们曾经不断地呼吁举行大国会议，这终于在一个月后也将初步实现了。我们要为国际紧张局势有了走向缓和的倾向表示庆贺。但我们没有丝毫理由可以表示满足，没有丝毫理由可以缓和一 下我们自己工作的紧张。“实力政策”的奉行者并没有改变他们的方针。他们依然在阻挠着世界人民的和平愿望的实现，依然在想尽方法欺骗人民，以便维持紧张的局势。特别是核子武器的不断增加生产，也就有不断增加的突然事变发生的可能性。为了人类的幸福，我们还必须提高警惕，毫不懈怠地为争取和平作更进一步的努力。我们要把极少数的好战分子完全孤立起来，要把原子能全面地为和平服务，永远消灭战争。
    全世界人民都表示着这样强烈的要求。我们要活，要活得更好，也要让别人活，让别人活得更好。我们必须更进一步尊重人民的意志，不断加强公众舆论的力量，为实现和平共处的美满的世界而作不屈不挠的斗争。
    战争必须彻底消灭，和平必须得到最后的胜利。　（新华社赫尔辛基二十四日讯）
