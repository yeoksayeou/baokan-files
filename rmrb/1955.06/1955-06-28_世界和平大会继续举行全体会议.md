Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, June 27th: The World Peace Congress held a plenary session on June 26th, according to TASS. The Soviet writer Fadeyev presided over the meeting.

The first speaker was Professor Lota Radaceanu, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Romanian National Assembly. In his speech, he condemned the United States' attempt to interfere in Romania's internal affairs. He also pointed out that the interests of peace and international cooperation require the establishment of a European collective security system.

British social activist Monica Felton pointed out that the decision to hold a meeting of the four heads of government was the result of the tenacious efforts of people of all countries in the world. She said that now that the meeting has become a reality, peace defenders should launch a struggle to win the victory of the ideas of peaceful coexistence and mutual understanding.

Australian representative Jessie Street pointed out in her speech that the establishment of military blocs threatening peace by some countries, especially the United States, is a gross violation of the United Nations Charter. She pointed out that depriving the People's Republic of China of its legitimate seat in the United Nations is also a serious example of violating the United Nations Charter.

Italian Senator Emilio Sereni spoke about the huge scale of Italy's struggle for peace. Some politicians and parliamentarians who previously stood outside the struggle have also begun to participate in this struggle. Sereni then spoke about the proposal made by French parliamentarian Vallon in his speech on the 23rd to establish neutral countries in Central Europe. He said that in Italy, this plan has also been proposed and has been supported by the famous politician Parri. Sereni said that the most important task at present is to ensure European security and mobilize public opinion in various countries to prevent the four-nation conference from being undermined.

Deb-Bride, Vice Chairman of the International Federation of Resistance Fighters and Victims of Fascist Persecution and Imprisonment, expressed the hope that the World Peace Congress would express its opinion on the German question. He said that we should take practical decisions to ease international tensions, and we should prepare public opinion to create an atmosphere of trust.

Giapelli, a member of the National Committee of the Youth Organization of the Italian Christian Democratic Party who attended the conference as an observer, said that he was one of those who had long held a cautious attitude towards the peace movement. In his speech, he agreed with the peaceful unity of European countries on a democratic basis and opposed US interference in the internal affairs of European countries. He called on the peace forces of European countries to unite broadly.

British scientist Professor Bernal pointed out that US citizens were prevented from attending the Peace Congress because someone was trying to avoid a danger: fearing that US citizens would hear suggestions on how to build peace. Bernal went on to emphasize that the most urgent task for peace advocates is disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. He said that we believe that the vast majority of people in the world agree with us on the issue of banning atomic weapons. Someone here said that we condemned one side without condemning the other. We answer that we condemn any country that refuses to express its determination to renounce the use of atomic weapons and in fact opposes the conclusion of an agreement banning such weapons.

Next, Soviet writer Ehrenburg spoke.

Ehrenburg pointed out that in some countries, very powerful people are trying to prolong and even strengthen the atmosphere of mistrust and create difficulties for the upcoming negotiations. The intentions of some politicians are disturbing, they are trying to make the upcoming negotiations lose the nature they should have, and put forward various demands in advance.

Ehrenburg said: Some politicians insist that the military alliance of the West is inevitable because "the Communists are deeply convinced of the ultimate victory of communism." Ehrenburg said: Yes, we Soviets believe that the future belongs to a society in which the means of production are not privately owned. But does this mean that our worldview threatens any country? He said that no Communist has ever said that in order for a country to transition to a higher stage of social development, it is necessary to launch a war, but on the contrary, all Communists have always believed that wars that destroy material and cultural wealth hinder social progress.

Ehrenburg then pointed out that, unlike the North Atlantic Group, the national alliance established in Warsaw is open to all countries, and if Britain or France wants to join, they will not be opposed in any way. The North Atlantic Treaty is a permanent organization, while the Warsaw Treaty will be abolished after the establishment of a European collective security system. Ehrenburg emphasized that we have always opposed dividing the world into two military blocs. We have always advocated the establishment of collective security and the cooperation of all countries and peoples.

He said that this is the only way out for those who hope for peace in Europe.

Ehrenburg then spoke about the Soviet people's goodwill towards the American people. He said that the Soviet people hope to cooperate with them in all aspects, and we hope to cooperate with them in organizing European collective security. Now is the time to end the bad tradition of the "Cold War" and it is time to work together, meet and be friendly.

Speaking of the German issue, Ehrenburg said that the withdrawal of occupying forces from the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic will help solve the German issue. In order to make German reunification possible, we must abandon the attempt to have Germany join any military alliance. The Soviet Union has always advocated the establishment of a unified and autonomous Germany in which German militarism will not rise again. The Soviet Union will do everything possible to promote this unity. Of course, the reunification of Germany should be achieved through free elections.

Ehrenburg then spoke about the issue of neutrality, saying, "I should say on behalf of the Soviet delegation: we understand those who advocate neutrality. The Soviet Union will solemnly respect the sovereignty and security of any country that wants to independently pursue a peaceful policy."

Ehrenburg concluded by saying that convening a meeting of the four heads of government itself shows how great the power of public opinion is. Whether the meeting can achieve the results desired by the people of the five continents of the world depends to a large extent on the people of all countries in the world. The people of all countries will never allow any participant in the talks to use the talks to cover up the "position of strength" policy. We will strive for the victory of the cause of peace.

Next, Baltasar Castro, head of the Chilean delegation, spoke. After Castro's speech, Vianna, the personal representative of Helio, spoke, conveying Helio's thanks for being elected honorary chairman of the conference.

French writer Jean-Paul Sartre also spoke at the meeting.

    世界和平大会继续举行全体会议
    新华社二十七日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：世界和平大会六月二十六日举行了全体会议。苏联作家法捷耶夫担任主席。
    第一个发言的是罗马尼亚国民议会外交委员会主席洛塔·拉达齐亚努教授。他在发言中斥责了美国企图干涉罗马尼亚内政的打算。他并且指出，和平和国际合作的利益要求建立欧洲集体安全体系。
    英国社会活动家蒙尼卡·费尔顿夫人指出，四国政府首脑即将举行会议的决定是世界各国人民顽强努力的结果。她说，但是，现在当这个会议已经成为现实的时候，和平保卫者就应该展开斗争，争取和平共处和相互谅解的思想获得胜利。
    澳大利亚代表杰西·斯崔特夫人在发言中指出，一些国家、特别是美国建立一些威胁和平的军事集团，是对联合国宪章的粗暴破坏。她指出，剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，也是严重地破坏联合国宪章的事例之一。
    意大利参议员埃米略·塞伦尼在发言中谈到了意大利争取和平的斗争的巨大规模。一些以前站在斗争之外的政治家和议会人士也开始参加了这种斗争。塞伦尼接着又谈到法国议员伐隆在二十三日发言中提出的在中欧建立中立国家的主张。他说，在意大利，这种计划也有人提出来了，并且还得到著名的政治家帕里的支持。塞伦尼说，目前最主要的任务就是：保障欧洲的安全，动员各国的舆论，不使四国会议遭到破坏。
    抵抗运动战士及受法西斯迫害与囚禁者国际联合会副主席德布—布里德表示，希望世界和平大会能够就德国问题表示意见。他说，我们应当采取使国际紧张局势趋于缓和的实际决定，我们应当准备舆论以造成信任的气氛。
    以观察员身分出席大会的意大利天主教民主党青年组织全国委员会委员贾普利说，他是对和平运动长期抱着慎重态度的那类人之一。他在发言中赞成欧洲国家在民主的基础上和平团结，反对美国干涉欧洲国家内政。他号召欧洲国家的和平力量广泛地团结起来。
    英国科学家贝尔纳教授指出，美国公民被阻止参加和平大会，是因为有人企图避免一种危险：恐怕美国公民听到关于建立和平的道路的建议。贝尔纳接着着重指出，和平拥护者的最迫切的任务是裁减军备和禁止原子武器。他说，我们相信，世界绝大多数的人们在禁止原子武器的问题上是同意我们的。这里有人说我们谴责一方，而没有谴责另一方。我们回答说，我们谴责拒绝表示决心放弃使用原子武器并且实际上反对缔结禁止这种武器的协议的任何一国。
    接着，苏联作家爱伦堡发言。
    爱伦堡指出，在某些国家里，十分有势力的人们企图延续甚至加强不信任的气氛，并且为即将举行的谈判造成困难。某些政治家的意图是令人不安的，他们企图使即将举行的谈判丧失谈判所应有的性质，预先提出各种要求。
    爱伦堡说：某些政治家硬说，西方的军事联盟是不可避免的，因为“共产党人深信共产主义最终胜利”。爱伦堡说：是的，我们苏联人相信未来是属于生产工具不为私人占有的社会的。但是，这是否意味着我们的世界观威胁着任何一个国家呢？他说，从来没有一个共产党员说过，为了使某一个国家过渡到更高的社会发展阶段，就需要发动战争，而是相反，所有的共产党员过去和现在都一直认为，破坏物质和文化财富的战争是阻挠社会进步的。
    爱伦堡接着指出，同北大西洋集团不同，在华沙所建立的国家同盟是对一切国家都开着大门的，如果英国或者法国要参加，它们是不会遭到任何反对的。北大西洋公约是一个永久性的组织，而华沙条约则是在欧洲集体安全体系建立起来后就要被废除的。爱伦堡着重说，我们一直反对把世界分裂为两个军事集团。我们一直主张建立集体安全，主张一切国家和人民进行合作。
    他说，这是希望欧洲和平的人的唯一出路。
    爱伦堡接着谈到苏联人民对美国人民的善意的感情。他说，苏联人民希望和他们在各方面合作，我们希望在组织欧洲集体安全方面也同他们合作。现在是终止“冷战”的恶劣传统的时候了，是共同工作、会晤和友好的时候了。
    爱伦堡在谈到德国问题时说，从德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国撤退占领军，将有助于德国问题的解决，为了使德国统一成为可能，必须放弃要德国参加任何军事联盟的企图。苏联过去和现在都主张建立这样一个统一和自主的德国：在这个德国中德国军国主义不会再起。苏联将尽一切力量促进这个统一。当然，德国的统一应该通过自由选举来实现。
    爱伦堡接着谈到中立的问题，他说，我应当代表苏联代表团说：我们了解拥护中立的人。苏联将庄严地尊重想独立执行和平政策的任何一个国家的主权和安全。
    爱伦堡最后说，召开四国政府首脑会议本身表明了舆论的力量是如何巨大。会议能否得到世界五大洲人民所渴望的结果，在很大程度上有赖于世界所有各国的人民。各国人民将永远不允许，会谈的任何一个参加者用会谈来掩盖“实力地位”政策。我们将努力争取和平事业的胜利。
    接着，智利代表团团长巴尔塔沙尔·卡斯特罗发言。在卡斯特罗发言后，由赫里欧的个人代表维安纳发言，他传达了赫里欧对选他为大会名誉主席的谢意。
    在会议上发言的还有法国作家让·保罗·萨特。
