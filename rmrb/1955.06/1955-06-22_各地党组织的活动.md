Activities of Party Organizations in Various Regions

    Mobilizing Workers' Families Flowing into Cities to Return to Their Hometowns for Production
    Since late March of this year, many family members of workers from the Jinlong Glass Factory in Hongkou District, Shanghai, have come to Shanghai from the countryside, citing fears of food shortages in rural areas. This not only affected the workers' production morale but also increased the city's grain supply burden. The factory's Party Branch Committee considered this a serious issue and convened a meeting of branch members for research. They found that these family members came to Shanghai not because they genuinely lacked food; the vast majority were motivated by selfish considerations.
    Subsequently, the branch assisted the trade union in organizing a discussion meeting for these family members. Through patient guidance and education, they all revealed their true intentions. It turned out that many families had enough grain to last until the summer harvest, but they came to Shanghai to have a more comfortable food situation at home. For example, worker Liu Xunzheng's family had over a hundred catties of grain, but his wife claimed they had nothing to eat.
    The branch used these actual cases to conduct propaganda and education for all the factory's workers, enabling them to have a correct understanding of the grain situation in rural areas. Then, together with the workers, they persuaded and educated the family members who had come to Shanghai, mobilizing them to return to their hometowns for production and increase grain production for the country. Sixty family members have returned to their hometowns.

    Resolving Difficulties in Mass Production
    In Dongyantou Township, Shunyi County, Hebei Province, some agricultural production cooperatives lacked funds to buy seeds, and some grain-deficient households did not have money to buy food, encountering significant difficulties in production and life, which seriously affected the spring sowing.
    In light of these circumstances, the township's Party Branch immediately convened a meeting of branch committee members to study the problem. The branch decided to hold a special discussion meeting for demobilized soldiers and other households with surplus funds. At this meeting, everyone was informed of the importance of investing in agricultural cooperatives and depositing in credit cooperatives for solving the capital shortage during spring plowing and the living difficulties of individual farmers. Investments and deposits would not only be repaid on time but also accrue interest, which was beneficial to everyone, including themselves. Wu Zhiwang, a demobilized soldier, immediately decided to contribute 400 yuan from his demobilization production subsidy, investing 150 yuan in the agricultural cooperative and depositing 250 yuan in the credit cooperative. Two other demobilized soldiers also voluntarily invested and deposited part of their demobilization subsidies in the agricultural cooperative and credit cooperative, respectively. With the active leadership of the demobilized soldiers and the subsequent door-to-door mobilization by township cadres, households with surplus funds all invested in agricultural cooperatives and deposited in credit cooperatives. In just three or four days, the credit cooperative received 1,725 yuan in deposits, and the agricultural cooperative received 470 yuan in investments. This fund played a significant role in supporting spring sowing and resolving the living difficulties of grain-deficient households. For example, the Zhang Zhizhong Agricultural Cooperative used the members' investment funds to buy 400 catties each of corn and soybean seeds, ensuring timely sowing. He Gui, a member with a family of five, had previously been unable to eat enough due to a lack of money to buy grain, affecting production. Since the credit cooperative lent him ten yuan to buy grain, the whole family has actively participated in production.

    Lectures on Promoting Materialism Achieve Results
    The work of lecturing on promoting materialistic thought and criticizing bourgeois idealistic thought in Guangzhou has achieved significant results. Over 21,000 staff members have attended the lectures, and the number of lecture districts has increased from the original fifteen to nineteen, but it still cannot meet the demands of those who wish to attend. The success of the lectures is due to two reasons: first, most district committees, organ party committees, and branches have conducted relatively thorough ideological mobilization, calling on party members to actively participate in the lectures themselves and influence and encourage the masses to voluntarily participate. Therefore, the number of participants from each unit has increased compared to the originally reported figures. Second, most speakers' lectures have generally been specific, vivid, popular, and easy to understand, so most staff members who have attended the lectures have broken away from the past incorrect thinking that "philosophy is profound and difficult to understand," "not daring to sign up for lectures," and "irrelevant to oneself," etc., arousing interest in studying philosophy and increasing confidence in studying philosophy. For example, many staff members of the Guangzhou Food Company were initially unwilling to attend lectures, but after attending the first lecture, they felt it was very helpful, and the number of people attending the lectures subsequently increased. Also, many staff members were often unaware of their past idealistic tendencies in their work, but after attending the lectures, they realized that subjectivism, bureaucracy, and empiricism in their work were actually manifestations of idealism. All of this has laid the foundation for further studying materialism and criticizing bourgeois idealism in the future. (Guang Wen)

    Rectifying Backward Rural Branches
    In the Heze Special District of Shandong, 96 percent of the townships have Communist Party branches, with a total of 44,060 party members. They have become the leading core and backbone force for the socialist transformation of agriculture. According to statistics, 80 percent of party members have joined mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and party branches have been established in more than 1,000 cooperatives.
    In the past six months, the CPC Heze District Committee has attached great importance to the consolidation and rectification of rural party organizations. It has successively sent 118 cadres to rural areas to rectify backward branches, and the work of many backward branches has undergone great changes. For example, the CPC Lvlou Township Branch in Yuncheng, with a total of 20 party members, previously had four members with backward thinking who did not work, and nine members who were passive in their work. The branch was unable to form a core leadership in various tasks. After rectification and education, not only did every party member become active in their work, but they also drove the collectivization movement throughout the township, consolidating all three previously problematic agricultural production cooperatives and thirty-nine mutual aid teams.

    各地党组织的活动
    动员流入城市的工人家属回乡生产
    今年三月下旬以来，上海市虹口区金龙玻璃厂有不少职工家属，借口农村吃粮恐慌，陆续从乡下来到了上海。这不但影响了职工们的生产情绪，还增加了城市的粮食供应。该厂党支部委员会认为这是一个严重问题，就召开支部党员大会进行研究，发现这些家属来到上海并不是真正没有粮食吃，绝大部分是出于自私自利的打算。
    接着支部又帮助工会组织这些家属开了个座谈会，经过耐心地启发和教育，他们都说出了真心话。原来很多家属的存粮足够吃到夏收，但是为了使家里粮食宽裕一点才来到上海的。比如工人刘训正的家里还有一百多斤粮食，妻子就叫着说没有吃粮了。
    支部就用这些实际事例向全厂职工进行了宣传教育，使职工对农村的粮食情况有了正确的认识。然后同职工一起对来到上海的家属进行了说服和教育，动员他们回乡生产，为国家增产粮食。先后已有六十个家属回乡去了。

    解决群众生产中的困难
    河北省顺义县东沿头乡有些农业生产合作社缺乏资金，买不起种籽，有些缺粮户没有钱买粮食，在生产和生活上遇到了很大的困难，严重地影响着春播的进行。
    根据这些情况，乡的党支部立即召开了支部委员会议，研究了这个问题。支部确定专门召开一次转业军人和其他有余资农户的座谈会。在这次座谈会上，向大家说明向农业社投资和向信用社存款对解决春耕中的资金和个别农户生活困难的重要意义，投资和存款不但会按时偿还，还有利息，这是对大家有利，对自己也有利的好事。转业军人吴志旺，当场决定拿出转业生产补助金四百元，一百五十元投入农业社，二百五十元存入信用社。另外还有两名转业军人也自动把自己的一部分转业补助金分别向农业社和信用社投资和存放。经过转业军人的积极带动，加上会后乡干部的挨户动员。有余资户都向农业社投资和向信用社存款了。只三、四天，信用社就收到存款一千七百二十五元，农业社收到投资四百七十元。这笔款对支持春耕播种和解决缺粮户的生活困难起了很大作用。如张志忠农业社利用社员投资款买了玉米和黄豆种各四百斤，保证了适时播种。社员何贵一家五口，过去因无钱买粮，吃不饱饭，影响了生产。自信用社借给他十元钱买了粮食，全家都积极地参加生产了。

    宣传唯物主义的演讲有成绩
    广州市宣传唯物主义思想批判资产阶级唯心主义思想的演讲工作，已经收到很大效果。参加听讲的工作人员已达两万一千多人，讲区已由原来的十五个增加到十九个，但仍不能满足愿意听讲者的要求。演讲工作所以取得成绩有两个原因：一个是绝大多数区委、机关党委和支部都作了比较充分的思想动员，号召党员除自己积极参加听讲而外，还应影响和带动群众自愿参加听讲，因此，各单位参加听讲的人数都比原报数字增多。其次，大多数报告员的演讲基本上作到了具体、生动、通俗、易懂，因此，使大多数听过演讲的工作人员都打破了过去认为“哲学深奥难懂”“不敢报名听讲”，“与自己无关”等等不正确的思想，引起了学习哲学的兴趣，增加了学习哲学的信心。如广州市食品公司很多工作人员，开始不愿参加听讲，但听过第一次演讲后，觉得有很大帮助，以后参加听讲的人数便增多了。还有不少工作人员对自己过去在工作中表现的唯心主义倾向常常不自觉，经过听讲以后认识到工作中的主观主义、官僚主义、经验主义等等，实际上就是唯心主义的表现。这些都给今后进一步学习唯物主义批判资产阶级唯心主义打下了基础。（广文）
    整顿农村落后支部
    山东菏泽专区百分之九十六的乡有了共产党的支部，共有党员四万四千零六十人。他们已成为当前对农业实行社会主义改造的领导核心和骨干力量。据统计百分之八十的党员参加了互助组和农业生产合作社，并在一千多个社中建立了党支部。
    近半年来，中共菏泽地委会非常重视农村党组织的巩固和整顿工作。曾先后派一百一十八名干部深入农村整顿落后支部，不少落后支部的工作已有很大转变。如中共郓城侣楼乡支部，共有党员二十人，过去有四人思想落后不做工作，有九人工作消极，支部在各种工作中不能形成核心领导。经过整顿教育后，不但每个党员工作都积极起来，而且带动了全乡的合作化运动，使原来问题很多的三个农业生产合作社和三十九个互助组全部巩固下来。
