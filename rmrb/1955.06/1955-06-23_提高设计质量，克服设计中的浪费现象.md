Improve Design Quality and Overcome Waste in Design
Li Ruhong, Acting Director of the Design Bureau, First Ministry of Machine Building

The design institutions under the Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building have been centralized for more than two years. In the past two years, the state has transferred more than 2,000 technical personnel to us, equipped us with a group of leaders, and hired more than 20 Soviet and Czech experts. Generally speaking, we have formed a relatively strong design force. In the past two years, we have completed preliminary designs for 24 factories (15 of which are effective), technical designs for 14 factories (9 of which are effective), and construction drawings for several engineering projects, and have undertaken design coordination work for 31 foreign design projects at various stages. This has played a certain role in ensuring the realization of the state's basic construction plan. However, our current design work is far from meeting the requirements of national construction. The main shortcomings are poor quality and slow progress, which generally lead to significant waste and poor results in the enterprises we design.

There are many reasons for the poor design quality and significant waste, but the most fundamental reason is the failure to correctly solve the following three issues:

First, the lack of a clear and rational design philosophy. Our designs for newly built and renovated factories are generally based on the design tasks prepared according to the long-term needs of the state. However, in the design process, we often consider the needs of the state in isolation from a single factory; we rarely consider how to meet the requirements of the state plan on an economically rational basis by connecting similar factories. In our designs, we blindly pursue the future expansion and development goals of the enterprise, which leads to excessive reservation of open space and development area, resulting in the waste of expanding the factory area and increasing basic construction investment. For example, the initial design plan for the Shanghai Motor Factory had a factory area one-third larger than the current plan, required the demolition of more than 100 civilian houses, and increased transportation routes and pipelines by several hundred meters, which would have increased investment by several million yuan. Another example is the Wuhan Boiler Factory, where the design task stipulated that the development goal was to cooperate with the production of the Shanghai Turbine Factory. However, the design plan we prepared not only reserved development area near the station, but also inappropriately left a large area of open space within the factory area, resulting in significant waste. Later, when we reviewed the design, we reduced the factory area, which saved tens of thousands of yuan in investment. In the original design plan for the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, too much development area was reserved between the front area of the factory and the workshops, resulting in a distance of more than 150 meters between the office building and the nearest workshop.

The lack of a clear and rational design enterprise philosophy is also reflected in the unreasonable layout of enterprises. Especially for the layout of renovated factories, we often make decisions subjectively instead of starting from the actual situation on site. For example, in the preliminary design plan for the renovation of the Dalian Locomotive Factory, the iron casting workshop had to be moved, many large pieces of equipment had to be relocated, 32 kilometers of railway lines had to be demolished, and more than 30,000 square meters of old buildings had to be demolished, while the potential for the factory to produce locomotives after renovation was not fully realized. After research and revision, it was proved that this plan was wasteful. Another example is that in order for the Shenyang Transformer Factory to meet the needs of producing large transformers, the possibility of renovating the fourth workshop, which has a low load, should be considered first. However, in our design, we were keen on building a heavy and small fifth workshop. This factory had two welding workshops in the design, the indicators of unit area were very low, and we did not carefully consider how to merge them into one welding workshop to improve the indicators of unit area and save production site area. Another example is that in the design plan of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, it was decided to move the large vertical lathe and spiral milling machine, which could not be moved, into the new span, and to demolish and rebuild the 24-meter-high chimney, which could not be demolished. If these mistakes were not corrected by Soviet experts, a lot of investment would have been wasted.

The lack of a clear and rational design enterprise philosophy is also reflected in the lack of attention to economic effects, with the simple view of completing the design task. For example, we designed the renovation projects of two locomotive and rolling stock factories. One factory only increased the production of passenger cars by two hundred and several tens, and the investment was 30 million yuan; the other factory only increased the production of locomotives by 120, and the investment was more than 80 million yuan. If the design plans of these two factories were considered together, not only could the same number of passenger cars and locomotives be produced, but also a lot of investment could be saved. Another example is that three electrical factories in the Shenyang area of the Electrical Industry Bureau wanted to build three casting workshops. If they were merged into one factory for production, tens of thousands of yuan in investment could be saved. Although this involves the arrangement of design tasks, if our design institutions can consider the economic effects of each factory's design, combined with the situation of similar factories and the needs of the state, and actively propose comparative plans, the design tasks can be stipulated more reasonably.

Second, in the application of advanced technical experience, there is a tendency to blindly adopt mechanized advanced equipment regardless of economic effects and whether it can improve productivity. For example, even a small boiler room was designed with automated coal crushing, screening, and selection equipment. Automatic lifting equipment is used for transformer assembly racks regardless of size. Many of the equipment lists listed in the design documents are copied from magazines or taken from books. We even choose these equipment without knowing their performance, how to operate them, whether they can be ordered, where to order them, and what the specifications are. For example, in the design of the iron casting workshop of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, a static electric sand separator was once selected to separate waste sand and coke powder. This equipment was only seen in magazines and could not be ordered at all; it was only changed to a general separator after being pointed out by Soviet experts. Another example is that when designing the large motor workshop of the Harbin Motor Factory, steam curtain doors were adopted. Now that the workshop has been built, the steam curtain doors are left empty, and it is still unknown how to design them. We also often choose other equipment that is not related to production, such as snow sweepers and automatic window opening and closing equipment, without thinking. This increases a lot of non-production investment.

We are enthusiastic about selecting new and advanced equipment, and we have relaxed the full utilization of old equipment. We are not very willing to adopt existing equipment that can be utilized or slightly modified, and we are not very interested in general equipment that can be manufactured or substituted domestically, on the grounds that "domestic equipment and old equipment cannot guarantee to achieve advanced indicators." This erroneous view has caused great waste in design.

But on the other hand, we emphasize objective difficulties for advanced process methods and advanced construction methods that may be possible, and are unwilling to actively adopt them. For example, in terms of process design, the heavy metalworking workshop of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory is of a single-piece, small-batch production nature. When designing, we should consider selecting universal equipment and preparing for product rotation, but we mechanically selected too many vertical lathes, which was only corrected after expert guidance. According to advanced process methods, the division of workshops in electrical factories should be based on similar product objects, but in our design, we adopted the method of dividing by parts and components. On the issue of building construction, we repeatedly emphasized that the quality of steel is not good, there is a lack of welding rods, and the welding technology cannot be mastered, and we are not actively adopting advanced welding methods; in fact, boiling steel cannot be welded on all structures, the welding rods produced by the Dalian Locomotive Factory meet the technical requirements, and many engineering companies can master the welding technology.

There is also a harmful idea. Some people say: "Adopting advanced technology will cost more money, and if you want to spend less money, you have to be more backward." This is obviously a wrong view that opposes technical advancement and economic rationality. Originally, the adoption of advanced technology is to achieve greater economic results. The adoption of advanced technology without economic results is mainly due to the failure to distinguish specific circumstances and blindly move. Therefore, the correct application of advanced technology is not only an important issue to ensure the technical advancement of the design plan, but also an important factor to make the design plan economically rational.

Third, the overall view of design work is not enough. Design departments often care about how to complete design tasks and deliver design documents and drawings according to the basic construction plan, but rarely consider how to rationally arrange the construction process according to the national production plan. Therefore, several factories we designed have built processing and assembly workshops, but the casting workshop has not yet been designed, or the tool workshop has not yet been built, which cannot enable the completed workshops to be put into production in advance. We have not seriously considered how to adapt to the needs of the basic construction period during the construction process and build woodworking, riveting, and welding workshops first to reduce the investment in temporary projects. In terms of equipment ordering, non-standard equipment design, and building materials procurement, we also often emphasize objective difficulties and lack the spirit of actively negotiating and cooperating with construction units to solve problems. Therefore, design is often modified or the quality and progress of design is affected due to changes in equipment and materials.

In order to improve design work, improve design quality, improve economic results, and save national investment, we must first effectively grasp the advanced Soviet design experience, quickly improve design quality, continuously improve political and ideological level and technical level, conscientiously study and grasp the state's construction policies, resolutely implement the central government's policy of practicing thrift, and check and overcome waste in design. Secondly, we must strengthen technical and economic work so that the design plan is based on sufficient technical basis, so as to improve quality and improve the design level. Therefore, in the next few years, we must gradually and systematically study and collate the technical and economic data of foreign designs, gradually formulate various technical standards and compile typical designs and reusable designs. In order to have a sufficient basis for future design plans, we should conduct investigations and studies on existing factories under the guidance of the planning department, prepare long-term development capacity planning plans; at the same time, we must actively and systematically learn and master advanced technology and establish economic analysis work. Thirdly, we must improve the organization and leadership of design work. We must transform the design organization work according to advanced design procedures and design methods, so that the work system and mutual relations of each design section are established on an orderly and coordinated basis. Overcome the current confusion and disconnect between insufficient contact, unclear responsibility, inconsistent systems, and inconsistent steps, so that the design quality and progress can be effectively and reliably guaranteed by the organization. Finally, we must further rely on the guidance of Soviet experts, strengthen political and ideological education, fully use and cultivate the existing technical force, so that the factory design institutions gradually grow into professional design institutions with independent design capabilities to meet the new, major and glorious construction tasks.

    提高设计质量，克服设计中的浪费现象
    第一机械工业部设计总局代局长　李如洪
    第一机械工业部设计总局的设计机构集中起来已有两年多了。两年来，国家给我们调集了二千多技术人员，配备了一批领导人员，聘请了二十多位苏联专家和捷克专家，一般地说已经组成了比较强的设计力量。两年来，我们共完成二十四个厂的初步设计（其中有效的十五个厂），十四个厂的技术设计（其中有效的九个厂）和若干工程项目的施工图纸，并负担了三十一个国外设计项目的各个不同阶段的设计配合工作。这对于保证国家基本建设计划的实现，是起了一定作用的。但是，我们目前的设计工作还远赶不上国家建设的要求，其中主要的缺点是质量不好和进度缓慢，因而我们所设计的企业，一般是浪费很大，效果不好。
    设计质量不好，浪费很大的原因是多方面的，其中最基本的原因是没有正确地解决以下三个问题：
    第一、没有明确树立经济合理的设计思想。我们设计的新建厂和改建厂，一般是按照国家长远需要所编的设计任务书进行的。但在设计过程中，我们往往孤立地从一个厂来考虑国家需要；很少把同类厂联系起来考虑如何在经济合理的基础上适应国家计划的要求。我们在设计当中，盲目追求企业将来的扩大发展目标，就过多地预留空地和发展面积，造成了扩大厂区面积，增加基本建设投资的浪费现象。例如上海电机厂最初的设计方案，厂区比现在的方案要大三分之一，民房要拆除一百多间，运输路线及管路要增加几百公尺，投资就要增加几百万元。又如武汉锅炉厂，设计任务书规定是以配合上海汽轮机厂的生产为发展目标的。可是我们编制的设计方案中不仅在车站附近留了发展面积，而且在厂区内也不适当地留了一大块空地，造成很大的浪费。后来我们在审核设计时，缩小了厂区面积，就可以节省投资数十万元。太原重型机器厂的原设计方案中，厂前区和车间之间预留了过多的发展面积，使办公大楼和最近的车间之间的距离远达一百数十公尺。
    没有明确树立经济合理的设计企业的思想，还表现在没有合理地安排企业的布局上。尤其对改建厂的布局，往往不从现场的实际情况出发，而是主观地作决定。例如改建大连机车厂的初步设计方案中，铸铁车间要搬家，许多大设备要搬动，铁路线要拆除三十二公里，旧建筑要拆除三万多平方公尺，而该厂改建后生产机车的潜力尚没有充分发挥。后来经过研究修正后，证明这个方案是浪费的。又如为了使沈阳变压器厂能满足生产大变压器的需要，应该首先考虑改建负荷不高的第四厂房的可能性，但是我们在设计中却热中于盖一个重型的而面积又不大的第五厂房。这个厂设计中有两个焊接车间，单位面积的指标都很低，而未很好地考虑如何合并为一个焊接车间，提高单位面积的指标，节省生产场地面积。再如沈阳重型机器厂设计方案中，决定把可以不搬的大立车床和螺旋铣床搬入新跨度，把可以不拆的二十四公尺高的烟囱拆除新建。这些错误如果不经过苏联专家纠正，就要浪费很多投资。
    没有明确树立经济合理的设计企业的思想，还表现在对于经济效果不够重视，有单纯完成设计任务的观点。例如，我们设计了两个机车车辆厂的改建工程，一个厂只增加客车产量二百几十台，投资要三千万元；另一个厂，只增产机车一百二十台，投资要八千多万元。如果把这两个厂的设计方案一起考虑，不仅可以增产同样多的客车和机车，还可以节省很多投资。又如电器工业局沈阳地区三个电工厂要建造三个铸工车间，如果合并于一个厂生产，就可以节省数十万元的投资。虽然这要牵涉到设计任务的安排问题，但如果我们设计机构能从各厂设计的经济效果，结合各同类厂的情况和国家的需要来考虑，积极提出比较方案，就能使设计任务规定得更合理。
    第二、在运用先进技术经验方面，有不计经济效果，不问能否提高生产率，盲目采用机械化的先进设备的偏向。例如：设计一个不大的锅炉房也采用了自动化的碎煤、筛煤、选煤设备。变压器的装配架不论大小都采用自动升降。设计文件中开列的设备清单，有不少是从杂志上抄下来的，也有从书上摘出来的。我们甚至连这些设备的性能如何，如何操作，能否订货，在哪里订货，规格型号如何都不知道，就选用上了。如太原重型机器厂铸铁车间的设计中，曾选用了静电型砂分离器来分离废砂枯焦粉末。这种设备只是在杂志上见到过，根本无法订货；后经苏联专家指出，才改用一般的分离器。再如设计哈尔滨电机厂的大型电机车间时，采用了暖汽门帘，现在这车间早已建成，而暖汽门帘却留下空位，至今尚不知如何设计。其他同生产无关的如扫雪机，自动开关窗门的设备等，我们也常常不加思索地选用了。这就增加了很多非生产投资。
    我们热心选择新的先进的设备，对于旧设备的充分利用就放松了。对能够利用或者稍加改装即可利用的原有设备就不大愿意采用，对国内可以制造或者可以代用的一般设备，也不大感到兴趣，理由是“国内设备和旧设备不能保证达到先进指标”。这种错误的看法造成了设计中很大的浪费。
    但另一方面，我们对可能做到的先进的工艺方法和先进的建筑施工方法却又强调客观困难，不愿意积极采用。例如在工艺设计方面，沈阳重型机器厂重型金工车间是单件小批生产性质的，设计时应该多考虑选用万能性设备，准备产品轮换，但是却机械地选用了过多的立车，经过专家指导后才纠正了。电器工厂的车间划分，按照先进工艺方法，应该按同类产品对象来划分，我们在设计中却采用了按零件和部件对象划分的方法。在建筑施工问题上，我们一再强调钢材质量不好，缺乏焊条，电焊技术掌握不住，而不积极地采用先进的焊接方法；实际上，沸腾钢并不是在所有结构上都不能焊接，大连机车厂出产的电焊条就合乎技术要求，电焊技术也有不少工程公司能够掌握。
    还有一种想法也是有害的。有人说：“采用先进技术就要多花钱，要想少花钱只好落后一些”。这显然是把技术先进性和经济合理性对立起来的错误看法。本来，采用先进技术就是为了达到更大的经济效果，采用先进技术而不能收到经济效果，主要是由于没有区别具体情况，盲目搬运所造成的。因此，正确地运用先进技术，不仅是保证设计方案技术先进的重要问题，也是使设计方案经济合理的重要因素之一。
    第三、设计工作的全面观点不够。设计部门经常关心如何完成设计任务，按照基本建设计划交付设计文件和图纸，却很少考虑如何按国家生产计划合理地安排建设程序。因而我们设计的好几个厂，加工装配车间建造起来了，铸造车间却还没有设计完，或者工具车间还没有建造，这就不能使已建车间提前投入生产。对于在建设过程中如何适应基本建设时期的需要，先建木工、铆焊等车间以减少暂设工程的投资，也不曾认真考虑。在设备订购，非标准设备的设计和建筑材料等的采购方面，我们也往往强调客观困难，缺乏主动和建设单位协商合作来解决问题的精神，所以常因设备、材料的变更就要修改设计或影响设计的质量和进度。
    为了改进设计工作，提高设计质量，提高经济效果，节约国家投资，我们首先要切实掌握苏联先进设计经验，迅速改进设计质量，不断提高政治思想水平和技术水平，认真研究并掌握国家建设的政策，坚决贯彻中央关于厉行节约的方针，检查和克服设计中的浪费。其次，要加强技术经济工作，使设计方案建立在有充分技术根据的基础上，以便改进质量，提高设计水平。因此，今后几年必须逐步地、系统地研究和整编国外设计的技术经济资料，逐步拟定各项技术标准和选编典型设计以及可以重复使用的设计。为使今后的设计方案有较充分的根据，应在计划部门指导下，对现有工厂进行调查研究，编制长远发展能力的规划方案；同时要积极地、系统地学习并掌握先进技术，建立经济分析工作。再次，要改进设计工作的组织领导，要按照先进的设计程序和设计方法，改造设计组织工作，使各设计科的工作制度、相互关系，建立在有秩序的、协调一致的基础上。克服目前存在的联系不够，责任不明，制度不一，步调不一的混乱脱节现象，使设计质量和进度获得切实可靠的组织保证。最后，要进一步依靠苏联专家的指导，加强政治思想教育工作，充分使用和培养现有技术力量，使工厂设计机构逐步成长为有独立设计能力的专业设计机构，以迎接新的、重大而光荣的建设任务。
