Resolutely Purge the Hu Feng Clique and All Hidden Counter-Revolutionary Elements
We Can No Longer Be Complacent Liang Xi
The materials and editor's notes on the Hu Feng clique published in the "People's Daily" between May 13th and June 10th have opened our eyes. It clearly tells us that Hu Feng was a special agent, and many important members of the Hu Feng and Hu Feng clique were loyal lackeys of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. They have long been waving the banner of revolution, wearing the cloak of Marxism, and pretending to be revolutionaries; but in fact, they are lurking within the revolutionary people, using double-dealing tactics to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. They have one set of words and deeds for public consumption and another set for private action. "They do not refuse or remain silent when invited to attend any symposiums," and "they do not complain to anyone." Behind the backs of the Party and the people, they provoke dissension everywhere, engage in conspiracies and tricks, "win people over," "contact people," expand "strength," "engage in pioneering work," and carry out counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy activities. Can we still be careless about such a group? No, absolutely not! We must actively participate in this serious political struggle to smash the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

Smashing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique is a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. It is a major event in the political life of the people and a responsibility that all revolutionary people should fulfill. No one can stand idly by. However, in our team of natural science workers, there are still varying degrees of the erroneous view of "it has nothing to do with me." This politically apathetic mood and indifferent attitude is a concrete manifestation of a lack of revolutionary vigilance. The reason for this phenomenon is, of course, due to the lack of political experience of many of us and the lack of understanding of the inseparable relationship between production struggle and class struggle; but the main reason is that we only care about our work, forget about politics, are arrogant and complacent, and are negligent. As a result, we do not have a deep understanding of the class struggle environment we are in, we do not have a clear understanding of the current class struggle situation, and we have forgotten that foreign imperialism is still surrounding us, and the resolute counter-revolutionaries among those classes that have been eliminated and will be eliminated in the country will still collude with imperialism, trying every possible means to sneak into the revolutionary camp to undermine our socialist construction cause, subvert our people's democratic power, and jointly carry out counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy activities. Obviously, if we forget the struggle against domestic enemies, we will naturally not feel the harm of counter-revolutionary activities, and we will not be able to recognize those hidden counter-revolutionaries who play double-dealing tactics. The counter-revolutionary Hu Feng took advantage of the political complacency of many of us to become rampant. Isn't this worthy of our deep vigilance?

We revolutionary people must be educated from this thrilling struggle, thoroughly correct the tendency of separating work from politics, raise revolutionary vigilance, and learn something from the Hu Feng incident. We must inspire revolutionary enthusiasm, learn to distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and gradually eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements from all fronts to ensure the complete victory of our socialist construction cause.

The struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has sounded the alarm for us. We must not turn a blind eye to the destructive activities of class enemies, and we must not be indifferent to the current political struggle. We must always remember Chairman Mao's sincere instructions to us in the opening speech of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will still make a final struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must not relax our vigilance."

My Accusation and Demands Deng Fangzhi
I was extremely angry when I heard and saw the various evils of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique on the radio and in the newspapers. I could no longer bear it, and I wanted to accuse this group of vicious counter-revolutionary elements.

It turns out that Hu Feng and his wolves were lackeys who stood on the side of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang and faithfully served them. As early as before liberation, they worked in Chiang Kai-shek's special agent organs and learned anti-people skills. They extremely hated the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party that led the Chinese people to gain liberation. After the national liberation, their masters collapsed, but they were still determined to serve their masters. They knew that open resistance would be suppressed by the people, so they adopted the cunning method of pretending to be good people, putting on a revolutionary coat, infiltrating the revolutionary camp, infiltrating the Chinese Communist Party, stealing Party secrets, and launching a large-scale offensive against the people in a strategic and planned way, intending to cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek to attack and defeat our people's regime and destroy our happy life. They are not human beings, but a group of poisonous snakes in human skin and with human heads. We lived with this group of snakes and scorpions for many years, and now we have finally discovered them and pulled them out of the crowd. This is another victory for us!

I know that our current happy life was achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party, after decades of heroic struggle, experiencing countless hardships, and bloodshed sacrifices. The people of the whole country protect it as they protect their own eyes. Everyone is working selflessly for its consolidation and greater prosperity, and some people are still holding guns and guarding the high mountains and the sea day and night. I myself gave my flesh and blood - my beloved sons Huang Jiguang and Huang Jishu - to the country, just to ensure that our happy life would never be damaged in the slightest. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique wanted to destroy our happy life in every possible way. The Hu Feng clique and his boss are the deadly enemies of the Chinese people.

Jiguang's blood was not shed in vain. The dreams of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang can only be dreams forever. The Hu Feng group of hidden counter-revolutionaries has finally been cleared out by the people. In the future, I will encourage Jishu to listen to the leaders in the army, hold the weapons in his hands tightly, and be vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies and sabotage at all times, and not let go of any enemies, whether they are open enemies or hidden counter-revolutionaries like the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. I also want to tell the boys and girls all over the country who warmly recognize me as their mother that I hope you will all work and study hard in your own posts and actively participate in the struggle to denounce the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

I am a people's representative, and Hu Feng's mask once deceived me. When electing representatives to the National People's Congress, I also mistakenly voted for him. Now, I demand that Hu Feng's qualifications as a representative of the National People's Congress be revoked, and I demand that the government punish the counter-revolutionary leader Hu Feng and other Hu Feng clique members who stubbornly follow Hu Feng, in accordance with the law.

The Face of Hu Feng I Have Seen Song Zhidi
I have known Hu Feng since 1936, and it has been almost 20 years now. Looking back now, for the past 20 years, Hu Feng has been sharpening his sword and watching the direction at all times. This is by no means the first time he has stretched out his dirty, bloody hand to the people. People who are familiar with Hu Feng will remember that Hu Feng has always been a person who is inherently prone to sowing discord. He is good at using the individual shortcomings in our work and the individual shortcomings of our individual comrades to carry out his conspiracies, exaggerating individual shortcomings, and pointing the finger at the Party and the people. Just like this group of his group said in their articles that they were adhering to the Party's principles while actually attacking the Party, just like he instructed his henchman Lu Ling to pretend to "be determined to write about the working people" while actually slandering the working people, Hu Feng's conspiracy to sow discord is often carried out through the spies he has placed in the Party among the masses. This is where its viciousness lies.

When the Pacific War broke out in 1941, the Party instructed the East River Column, which insisted on the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare on the border of Hong Kong, to make great efforts to rescue the cultural figures who had fallen into Hong Kong. Anyone who was rescued by the East River Column should still remember the self-sacrificing spirit with which the East River Column organized the evacuation at that time. In order to organize the evacuation, they risked their lives, and many comrades sacrificed heroically; in order to organize the evacuation, they had to take out their only rations and pawn everything, so that they could only eat grass roots and bark to maintain their fighting lives when they were attacked by the enemy later. How can anyone with a little conscience not be moved?! But Hu Feng launched a frenzied attack on the Party when the Party was helping him. People who escaped together at that time should remember how Hu Feng took advantage of the difficult environment at that time and the emotions of some comrades who could not endure hardship to incite dissatisfaction with the Party and launched his vicious attacks on the comrades of the East River Column. The fact that his incitement could only expose his despicable nature proved that he retreated and claimed that he was acting impulsively. Of course, he succeeded in retreating that time. His ugly face was not completely exposed, and the comrades mistakenly thought that this was just his individualism at work, so they forgave him.

After the Southern Anhui Incident in 1941, as a protest and as a preparation for refuge, progressive cultural figures in Chongqing left one after another. At the same time as the progressive cultural figures left for Hong Kong, two people came, one was Hu Feng, and the other was the film director He. Hu Feng came with the travel expenses aided by the Communist Party in the posture of a progressive cultural figure, and He came with a large amount of activity funds from the Kuomintang Film Studio in the posture of an important member of the Kuomintang Film Studio. After He arrived in Hong Kong, he used the strong power of Tianyi Company, a special agent film company in Hong Kong at that time, to launch attacks and persecutions on the progressive film and drama circles. Obviously, this He was sent to Hong Kong by the Kuomintang at that time, specifically to be responsible for persecuting the progressive drama and film circles. Can it be imagined that Hu Feng, who claimed to be a revolutionary writer, could cooperate with He, a notorious person whom everyone avoided and whose name alone made people shiver? But a strange thing actually happened. Although it was extremely confidential, the news was still leaked, saying that the "revolutionary writer" Hu Feng was secretly writing a film script for the special agent director He. When this strange thing was finally leaked, someone questioned Hu Feng, asking him what exactly this was all about! I remember that Hu Feng answered with a red face and ears: he and He were familiar with each other and knew each other when they were studying in Japan. He was just confused and not necessarily as bad as some comrades thought. Even if he was bad, he asked for his help, and he could also do some good through him, right? Anyway, even if he didn't help him, he could still make movies, wouldn't that be even worse? and so on. What a strange thing! Of course, now it seems that this is not surprising at all. Now it seems that these two were originally the same kind of people who followed different paths. However, He was openly dispatched, while Hu was secretly dispatched.

For the past 20 years, Hu Feng has been flaunting the banner of helping young people in society. But what kind of people are the young people he has helped? For a long time, although I was familiar with him, I never understood. And as far as I know, there doesn't seem to be a single young person who really wants to do something for the revolution and for the people. As for the people I don't know, who secretly come and go with Hu Feng, such as the group that has now been exposed, Hu Feng has never been willing to introduce them to others. Even if they meet sometimes, Hu Feng never introduces them. Therefore, a sentence is circulating among friends, saying that Hu Feng's people are in Hu Feng's pocket. And who Hu Feng comes and goes with, Hu Feng keeps it a secret and is very afraid of people knowing. I remember that in Chongqing back then, there was a small circle in the drama circle, and the leader of that small circle was a person who was dissatisfied with the Party. Once, this person accidentally leaked that they had just invited Hu Feng to give a report. Later, when I saw Hu Feng, I asked him what report he had given them. Hu Feng immediately looked very embarrassed and tried his best to deny that such a thing had happened. At that time, I was very surprised and talked to my friends, thinking that it was normal for a "celebrity" like Hu Feng to give a report to young people. What was the need to hide it? At that time, we thought that Hu Feng's secretiveness was just the result of sectarianism. Who knew that our thinking was too naive and too childish. He was actually using the name of helping young people to "win people over," "contact people," and entice those young people with more serious individualistic emotions to cultivate wings for his counter-revolutionary group. What he did was shameful, so he had to be so secretive, putting his henchmen in his pocket so that they wouldn't leak any information one day. But the painted skin ghost is still a ghost after all, and ghosts always want to eat people, so Hu Feng, who is good at pretending, has finally become overworked and "obscured by optimistic estimates," thinking that the Communist Party and the people can be deceived, and "finally made a reckless advance," stretching out his sinful hand to the Party and the people and exposing his counter-revolutionary ugly face in broad daylight.

Now it can be clearly seen that at the end of the Liberation War, when the Party comrades in Hong Kong were worried that Hu Feng's living in the harsh environment of Shanghai was dangerous and advised him to go to Hong Kong to transfer to the liberated areas, why he hated saying that he was being "forced." He actually knew very well in his heart that living in Shanghai under the rule of his master was the safest and least dangerous for him. Here, what Hu Feng said to his henchmen was his true words. But Hu Feng was finally kindly invited to the liberated areas. The reason why he was willing to come must have been under the orders of his master! His master knew very well that only by sending this disguised counter-revolutionary element into the liberated areas could their "digging heart war" be more effective and their "cluster grenade" be more effective! But with the great victory of the Party and the people, Hu Feng became more and more crazy. He was so crazy that he became overworked, and finally peeled off his beautiful painted skin and revealed his hideous ghost face!

Hu Feng and all the stubbornly unrepentant and resolute counter-revolutionary elements who followed Hu Feng must be severely punished in accordance with the law. No matter how clever the disguise is, it is useless. This time, the people have seen through your dirty hearts and will no longer be deceived! This time, the people will resolutely and thoroughly dig up your bottom! Investigate your household registration! This is another great victory for our Party and the people in the cruel class struggle. We must consolidate this great victory and use the resolute and merciless struggle against Hu Feng and Hu Feng elements to consolidate this victory!

Raise Vigilance and Strengthen the Study of Marxism Yu Pingbo
After the "People's Daily" successively published three batches of materials from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, the truth about Hu Feng's anti-Party, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities has been revealed to the world. This is no longer just a question of literary thought, but a political question. In addition to "verbal criticism and written denunciation," we must also ask the government to thoroughly investigate, severely punish them in accordance with the law, and remove these hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique: first, wears the cloak of Marxism-Leninism; second, dares to launch a rampant attack on the Party; and third, engages in organized, planned, and step-by-step counter-revolutionary activities. It is so cleverly hidden, so deeply hidden, so vicious, and so sinister. It has layers of smoke screens, and it is not easy to see through at a glance. We initially mistakenly regarded Hu Feng as a "progressive writer," but later we recognized the essence of his reactionary literary theory, and finally we learned that he had long been colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek gang and was a thorough counter-revolutionary element. By gradually clarifying, we have come to a thorough understanding. This process is enough to illustrate our complacency. But the true colors of this group have finally been exposed, and this is a major victory for the Party and the people recently.

In these layers of smoke screens, the Hu Feng clique promotes its counter-revolutionary activities through bourgeois subjective idealism literary theory. I think this is the most worthy of attention from our literary and art circles, and I, especially, should be very vigilant. Although I recognized the errors of subjective idealism literary theory in the past, I did not fully estimate how it harmed the interests of the people. Now I am alarmed by the counter-revolutionary incident of the Hu Feng clique. Now let's imagine, if there were no bourgeois idealism rampant in our literary and art circles and education circles, Hu Feng would have nowhere to build his base, and these counter-revolutionary group members would have nowhere to use their tricks to "be ghosts and goblins." Who do they want to "win over"? Who do they want to confuse? Conversely, if reactionary literary and artistic thought continues to be rampant in the cultural and educational circles, then even if the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements have been eliminated, similar Hu Feng counter-revolutionary elements will still have room for their activities.

The current problem is how to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism so that everyone can master this weapon, and the influence of bourgeois idealism can be eliminated. This is the way to get to the root of the problem. We intellectuals must carry out ideological remolding, and of course, we must be very vigilant against counter-revolutionary elements like Hu Feng; we should also draw more and deeper experiences and lessons from the Hu Feng incident. We must fight to the death with all counter-revolutionary elements.

Plug the Loopholes in Our Thinking Chen Bohua
Before the materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique were published, many people thought that the Hu Feng issue was a "minor issue in literary theory debate." Because I didn't understand what Hu Feng was at all in the past, and at the same time, my literary cultivation, especially my political cultivation, was very poor, I couldn't criticize this kind of "minor issue" statement.

Soon, the "People's Daily" successively published three batches of materials from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. These materials peeled off the disguise of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique layer by layer like sharp blades, not only clearing away all incorrect views on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, but also giving people with such views the most realistic education.

Why were there all kinds of popular sayings such as "this is a minor issue in literary theory debate" and "this is a petty-bourgeois ideological issue"... before the materials were published? This is because our revolutionary vigilance is not high and our political cultivation is poor. Some of these statements were smoke screens released by Hu Feng elements in order to prevent their counter-revolutionary clique from being exposed. Because our revolutionary sense of smell is not sensitive, we cannot expose the enemy's conspiracy in time, but instead help the enemy spread the smoke screen among the people.

Now, things are not over! American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang will never be reconciled to this failure, and they will send more and more cunning special agents to undermine our socialist construction cause. Our opera workers must step up the study of Marxism-Leninism, improve political vigilance, and learn to distinguish all hidden enemies.

To prevent the enemy from having any opportunity to take advantage of, we must first plug the loopholes in our thinking.

    坚决肃清胡风集团和一切暗藏的反革命分子
    决不能再麻痹了  梁希
    “人民日报”在五月十三日至六月十日之间所发表的关于胡风集团的材料和编者按语，把我们大家的眼睛都打开了。它明确地告诉我们：胡风是一个特务，胡风和胡风集团的许多重要分子都是帝国主义和蒋介石的忠实走狗。他们长时期打起革命的招牌，披着马克思主义的外衣，伪装革命；实际上却潜藏在革命人民内部，采取两面派的手法干着反革命勾当。他们是明一套，暗一套。“奉邀出席什么座谈会之类，不推托，不沉默”，“不对任何人发什么牢骚”。他们背着党、背着人民，到处挑拨离间，施展阴谋诡计，“争取人”，“联络人”，扩充“实力”，“从事开辟工作”，进行反革命复辟的阴谋活动。对这样的集团，我们还可以马虎过去吗？不，绝对不能！我们必须积极投入粉碎胡风反革命集团的这场严重的政治斗争，来肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子。
    粉碎胡风反革命集团，是一场革命同反革命的斗争，是全国人民政治生活中的一件大事，是一切革命人民应尽的责任，谁也不能袖手旁观。但是在我们自然科学工作者的队伍中还存在着不同程度的“与我无关”的错误看法，这种在政治上的麻痹情绪和漠不关心的态度，就是缺乏革命警惕性的具体表现。其所以产生这种现象，固然是由于我们许多人的政治经验不足，对生产斗争和阶级斗争不可分割的联系缺乏理解；但主要的还是由于我们只顾业务，忘记政治，骄傲自满，麻痹大意。因而对我们所处的阶级斗争的环境体会不深，对当前的阶级斗争形势认识不清，忘记了国外的帝国主义还在包围着我们，国内的那些已经被消灭的和将被消灭的阶级中间的坚决反革命分子仍然会同帝国主义勾结起来，千方百计地企图钻进革命阵营内部来破坏我国的社会主义建设事业，颠覆我国人民民主政权，共同进行反革命复辟的阴谋活动。很显然，忘记了反对国内敌人的斗争，自然就感觉不到反革命分子活动的危害性，就认识不到那些玩弄两面派手法的暗藏的反革命分子。反革命胡风正是利用我们许多在政治上的麻痹而猖狂起来的，这难道还不值得我们深深警惕吗？
    我们革命人民必须从这次惊心动魄的斗争中受到教育，彻底地纠正那些业务脱离政治的偏向，提高革命警惕，从胡风事件学得一些东西。我们要激发革命热情，学会区别敌我，从各个战线上把一切反革命分子一步一步地清除干净，确保我们社会主义建设事业的彻底胜利。
    肃清胡风反革命集团的斗争，给我们大家敲起了警钟，我们对阶级敌人的破坏活动决不能熟视无睹，对当前的政治斗争决不能漠不关心。我们要时刻记着毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上的开幕词中对我们的恳切指示：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    我的控诉和要求  邓芳芝
    我从收音机和报纸听到和看到胡风反革命集团的种种罪恶，心里气愤极了，我再也忍耐不住了，我要控诉这群恶毒的反革命分子。
    原来胡风和他的狼群，是站在帝国主义和蒋匪帮一边，忠实为他们服务的走狗。早在解放前，他们就在蒋匪特务机关里干事，学习反人民的本领。他们极端仇恨中国人民和领导中国人民获得解放的中国共产党。全国解放了，他们的主子垮台了，但他们仍死心蹋地为他们的主子卖命。他们知道公开抗拒会遭到人民的镇压，就采取假装好人的鬼办法，披上革命外衣，打入革命阵营，打入中国共产党，盗窃党的机密，有策略有计划地向人民大举进攻，打算同蒋介石里应外合，攻垮我们的人民政权，破坏我们的幸福生活。他们不是人，是一批披着人皮、长着人头的毒蛇。我们同这批蛇蝎在一堆住了好多年，现在终于发现了，把它从人群中抓了出来。这是我们的又一次胜利！
    我知道我们现在的幸福日子，是在共产党的领导下，经过了几十年的英勇斗争，经历了无数艰难困苦，流血牺牲才取得的。全国人民像爱护自己的眼睛一样地保护它。大家都为了它的巩固和更加繁荣而忘我地劳动着，有的人还拿着枪杆日夜守卫在高山上和大海边。我自己也就是为了我们的幸福生活永远不受到一点破坏，才把我的血肉——我最心爱的儿子黄继光、黄继恕先后交给了国家。胡风反革命集团却要千方百计破坏我们的幸福生活，胡风集团和他的老板是中国人民的死敌。
    继光的鲜血没有白流，美帝国主义和蒋匪帮的梦想永远只能是梦想，胡风这批暗藏的反革命分子终于被人民清出来了。今后我更要鼓励继恕在部队好好听首长的话，握紧手中武器，时时刻刻警惕敌人的阴谋破坏，不论是公开的敌人，还是像胡风反革命集团这样隐蔽起来的反革命分子，都丝毫不放过。我还要告诉全国各地亲热地认我为妈妈的男女孩子们，希望你们都在你们自己的岗位上，努力工作和学习，并踊跃参加声讨胡风反革命集团的斗争。
    我是一个人民代表，胡风的假面目曾经蒙混了我。在选举全国人民代表大会代表时，我也错投了他的票。现在，我要求撤销胡风的全国人民代表大会代表的资格，并要求政府依法惩办反革命头子胡风及其他死心蹋地跟着胡风跑的胡风集团分子。
                        （原载“四川日报”）
    我所看见的胡风的嘴脸  宋之的
    我从一九三六年认识胡风，到现在快二十年了。现在回忆起来，二十年来，胡风是无时无刻不在磨他的剑，窥测方向的。这决不是他第一次向人民伸出了他那只肮脏的血腥的手。熟悉胡风的人，都会记忆起来，胡风从来就是一个挑拨离间成了本性的人。他善于利用我们工作中的个别缺点，利用我们个别同志的个别缺点，进行他的阴谋活动，把个别缺点夸大，把矛头指向党，指向人民。正像他们集团这一群在写文章的时候，口口声声地说自己是坚持党的原则而实际上是攻击党一样，正像他指示其党羽路翎伪装“立志要写劳动人民”而实际是污蔑劳动人民一样，胡风这种挑拨离间的阴谋活动，也常常总是通过他打进党内的奸细分子，在群众中间进行的。其毒辣处就在于此。
    一九四一年太平洋战争爆发的时候，党指示在香港边境坚持抗日游击战争的东江纵队，要用绝大努力，援救沦陷在香港的文化人出险。凡是经东江纵队的援救而脱险的人谅来都还记得，东江纵队当时是以怎样的自我牺牲精神，组织了那次撤退的。他们为了组织撤退，自己甘冒生命的危险，有不少同志英勇地牺牲了；他们为了组织撤退，不能不拿出自己仅有的口粮，典尽卖绝，以至到以后遭到敌人的进攻时，只能吃草根树皮来维持他们的战斗的生命。稍有人心的人能不感动吗？！但胡风却在党这样援助他的时候，向党进行了疯狂的攻击。那次一齐脱险的人应该记得，胡风在当时是怎样利用当时艰苦的环境，利用某些同志吃不了苦的情绪，煽动对党的不满，对东江纵队的同志进行了他的恶毒的攻击。事实证明了他的煽动只能暴露他的卑鄙时，他才实行退却，诡称自己意气用事。当然，那一次他退却是成功了，他的丑恶的嘴脸并未完全暴露，同志们误认为这只是他的个人主义在作怪，也就原谅了他。
    一九四一年皖南事变以后，作为一种抗议，也作为一种避难的准备，在重庆的进步的文化人纷纷出走。和进步的文化人出走香港同时，来了两个人，一个是胡风，一个是电影导演何某。胡风是以进步文化人的姿态拿了共产党援助的旅费来的，何某是以国民党电影制片厂的要员姿态拿了国民党的大批活动资金来的。何某到达香港以后，即运用当时香港的特务电影公司天一公司的雄厚力量向进步的电影戏剧界展开了攻击和迫害。很明显，这位何某是当时国民党派到香港，专门负担迫害进步的戏剧电影界的任务的。能不能设想，以革命作家自居的胡风，能够跟这样一个臭名远扬人人避之惟恐不及言之都要齿冷的何某合作呢？但怪事竟然发生了，虽然极为机密，消息却还是泄露出来了，说“革命作家”胡风正在为特务导演何某偷偷地写作电影剧本。当这件怪事到底泄露出来了的时候，有人曾质问胡风，问他这究竟算怎么一回子事！记得当时胡风面红耳赤地回答说：自己和何某熟识，在日本留学的时候就认识，何某只是糊涂，不一定像某些同志所设想的那么坏，即使是坏吧，他求到自己的门下，自己帮他写剧本，不是也可以通过他做些好事吗？反正自己不去帮他，他一样也能拍电影，岂不更坏吗？云云。真是咄咄怪事！当然，现在看起来，这一点也不奇怪了。现在看起来，这两位原是殊途同归的一票货色。不过何某是公开派遣的，而胡某是秘密派遣的吧了。
    二十年来，胡风是一直打着帮助青年的旗号在社会上招摇的。但受他帮助的青年究竟是些什么人呢？很长的一个时期，虽然我跟他是熟人，却一直弄不清。而我所知道的，真正想为革命，为人民做一些事情的青年，似乎一个也没有。而我所不知道的，跟胡风诡秘地来往，如像现在已经暴露的这一批，胡风是从来不肯给人介绍认识的。即使有时候碰到，胡风也从不介绍。因之，朋友中流传着一句话，说胡风的那些人，是揣在胡风的口袋里的。而胡风究竟同什么人来往，胡风是保守机密的，很怕人知道。记得当年在重庆，戏剧界有个小圈子，那个小圈子的首领，是个对党有不满情绪的人。有一次，这个人偶然泄露，说他们刚刚约胡风作了报告。以后我见到胡风，问他给他们做了什么报告，胡风马上很狼狈，极力否认有这末一件事。当时我很惊奇，也同朋友谈过，觉得像胡风这样的“名人”给青年去做次把报告，也是常事，有什么瞒人的必要呢？当时，我们以为胡风的这种诡秘，不过是宗派主义在作祟，谁知我们的想法是太天真，太幼稚了。他其实是借帮助青年之名，在“争取人”，“联络人”，诱买那些个人主义情绪比较严重的青年，为他的反革命集团培养羽翼。他做的事是见不得人的，因之，他不能不那么诡秘，把他的党羽揣在他的口袋里，以免有一天会透了气。但画皮的鬼终归是鬼，而鬼总是要吃人的，所以善于作伪的胡风，这次倒底是心劳日拙“被乐观估计所蔽”，以为共产党和人民是可欺而“终于冒进”，猖狂地向党和人民伸出了他那只罪恶的手，把他反革命的丑脸暴露在光天化日之下了。
    现在可以清楚地看出，解放战争末期，当在香港的党员同志为了担心胡风住在环境恶劣的上海有危险，劝他到香港转解放区时，他为什么会那样仇恨的说是在“逼”他了。他其实自己心里明白，住在他主子统治下的上海，对他来说，是最安全，最没有危险了。在这儿，胡风对他党羽所讲的，倒是他自己的真心话。但胡风却终于被好心好意的请到解放区来了，他之所以肯来，想来是受了他主子的命令吧！他的主子很清楚，只有把这个伪装的反革命分子送进解放区，才更能发挥他们的“挖心战”的力量，才更能发挥他们的“集束手榴弹”的力量！但随着党和人民的伟大的胜利，胡风是越来越疯狂了，他疯狂得心劳日拙，终于剥下了美丽的画皮，露出了他那副狰狞的鬼脸！
    必须依法严惩胡风，以及一切跟了胡风跑的死不悔悟的坚决反革命分子。任何巧妙的伪装，都是没有用的，人民这一次是看透了你们肮脏的心，再不会受骗了！人民这一次要坚决彻底地挖掉你们的底！追查你们的户口！这是我们党和人民在残酷的阶级斗争里又一次伟大的胜利，我们要巩固这一伟大胜利，用跟胡风和胡风分子进行坚决无情的斗争来巩固这一胜利！
    提高警惕，加强马克思主义的学习  俞平伯
    “人民日报”陆续公布了胡风反革命集团的三批材料后，胡风他们的反党，反人民，反革命的真相已大白于天下了。这已不止是文艺思想的问题，而是一个政治问题。我们在“口诛笔伐”以外还要请求政府彻底追究，依法严惩，把这些暗藏的反革命分子清除出去。
    胡风反革命集团一，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，二，敢于向党猖狂地进攻，三，进行有组织、有计划、有步骤的反革命活动。它隐蔽得这样巧妙，潜伏得这样长远，这样的毒辣，又这样的阴险。它有重重的烟幕，不容易一眼看穿。我们起初误认胡风为“进步作家”，后来才认明他的反动文艺理论的本质，最后才知道他跟蒋匪帮久有勾连，是个地地道道的反革命分子。逐步地澄清，才得到彻底的认识。这个经过足以说明我们的麻痹。但这个集团的原形终于被揭露出来了，这是党和人民最近的一大胜利。
    胡风集团在这重重的烟幕里，通过资产阶级主观唯心主义的文艺理论来推进它的反革命活动。我认为这一点最值得我们文艺界同志注意，像我这样，尤其应该十分警惕才对。我对于主观唯心主义的文艺理论，过去虽认识它的错误，但对它怎样危害到人民的利益，估计得却非常不够，现在从胡风集团的反革命事件才使我警觉起来。今且试想，我们的文艺界、教育界若没有资产阶级唯心主义在泛滥着，胡风将无处建立他的阵地，这些反革命集团分子，“为鬼为蜮”也将无所施其伎。他们要“争取”，争取谁？要迷惑，又迷惑谁？反过来说，假如反动的文艺思想还继续在文教界泛滥着，那末胡风反革命分子纵已肃清，而类似胡风的反革命分子依然有他活动的余地。
    当前的问题是怎样加强马克思列宁主义的学习，使人人都能掌握这个武器，资产阶级唯心主义的影响就能得到肃清，这才是正本清源的办法。我们知识分子要进行思想改造，对于像胡风这样的反革命分子，当然要十分的警惕；我们更应该从胡风事件里吸取更多更深的经验和教训。我们必须跟一切反革命分子作殊死的斗争。
    堵塞我们思想中的漏洞  陈伯华
    在胡风反革命集团的材料未公布以前，不少人认为胡风问题是一个“文艺理论争论上的小问题”。我由于过去根本不了解胡风是什么东西，同时自己在文学修养上、尤其是在政治修养上都很差，因而对这种“小问题”的说法也不能加以批判。
    不久，“人民日报”连续发表了三批胡风反革命集团的材料。这些材料像利刃一样把胡风反革命集团的伪装一层一层地剥了开来，不仅扫清了一切对胡风反革命集团不正确的看法，而且也使具有这类看法的人们受了一次最现实的教育。
    为什么在材料发表以前会有“这是一个文艺理论争论上的小问题”、“这是一个小资产阶级思想意识问题”……等形形色色的流行说法呢？这是因为我们革命警惕性不高、政治修养差。有的这一类的说法还是胡风分子为了不使他们的反革命集团暴露所放的烟幕。由于我们革命嗅觉不灵，就不能即时揭露敌人的阴谋，反而帮助敌人把烟幕在人民当中散开了。
    现在，事情并没有完！美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮决不会因这一次失败而甘心的，他们将会派遣更多的更狡猾的特务来破坏我们的社会主义建设事业。我们戏曲工作者必须加紧学习马克思列宁主义，提高政治警惕性，学会辨别一切暗藏的敌人。
    要想使敌人无隙可乘，首先要堵塞我们思想上的漏洞。
