Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, June 24th: The tenth anniversary commemorative meeting of the signing of the United Nations Charter continued on June 23rd.

    Polish Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski spoke. He pointed out that the serious shortcomings in the UN's work over the past decade have arisen because some major powers have attempted to turn the UN into a tool to force others to accept decisions that violate the UN Charter, hindering the resolution of many international issues. He said that even now, some people are obstructing the great Chinese people from obtaining their legitimate rights in the UN, which weakens the work of the UN. He said that the UN has not yet been able to resolve a series of important issues, including the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and disarmament.

    Skrzeszewski emphasized that the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed by the participating countries of the Warsaw Conference is a treaty of a defensive nature. It was signed entirely for the sake of peace in Europe and is fully in line with the UN Charter. This treaty is open to all countries in Europe, which strongly demonstrates our belief that countries with different social and political systems can coexist peacefully and cooperate.

    Mexican Foreign Minister Nájera expressed welcome to the convening of the four-power summit conference. He said: "To solve all problems, first and foremost the problem of establishing lasting peace, requires solving a fundamental problem: reaching an agreement among the major powers. … The upcoming four-power summit is a very promising event. Perhaps the time has come for the people of all countries to expect an agreement to be reached.”

    The head of the French delegation, Pinay, said that the UN "should first" "concentrate its efforts on solving the issues of disarmament and the peaceful use of atomic energy." He said, "In recent months, a lot of work has been done in the area of disarmament," and all parties "are working hard to find a new plan that is acceptable to all countries." Pinay defended the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, insisting that the activities of this group "will not intensify international tension."

    Belarusian Foreign Minister Kiselev said that there are still many countries without representation in the UN, and this situation hinders the normal work of the UN. The absence of the People's Republic of China in the UN makes it difficult to smoothly resolve the most important international issues, especially those related to Asia and the Far East. When talking about the issue of disarmament, Kiselev said that the key to the problem now does not lie with the Soviet Union, but with the Western countries. The Western countries should agree not to use atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and agree to completely prohibit these weapons. Peace-loving people of all countries are expecting the Western countries to take this step, expecting them to do it in practice rather than just saying it.

    Thai representative Prince Wan Waithayakon said that starting from the basic principles of the UN Charter and the ten principles adopted by the Bandung Asian-African Conference, "any ideological differences between countries should not preclude the possibility of establishing peaceful relations between them."

    Dutch Foreign Minister Luns, in his speech, reflected the anxiety felt by colonial countries about the growing national liberation movements in Asia and Africa.

    The head of the Norwegian delegation, Norwegian Minister of Commerce Skaug, in his speech, called on the representatives of all countries to more actively use the UN as a "tool to improve international relations."

    联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会继续举行会议
    波兰墨西哥等国代表就国际关系问题发言
    新华社二十五日讯　据塔斯社旧金山二十四日讯：联合国宪章签订十周年纪念会在二十三日继续举行会议。
    波兰外交部长斯克热歇夫斯基发言。他指出，联合国过去十年的工作中的严重缺点的产生，是由于某些大国企图把联合国变成强迫别人接受违背联合国宪章的决定的工具，阻挠了许多国际问题的解决。他说，直到现在仍然有人在阻挠伟大的中国人民获得他们在联合国中的合法权利，这削弱了联合国的工作。他说，联合国至今还没有能够解决一系列的重要问题，其中包括禁止原子武器、氢武器和裁减军备问题。
    斯克热歇夫斯基着重指出，华沙会议的参加国签订的友好合作互助条约，是防御性质的条约，它完全是为了欧洲的和平而签订的，也是完全符合联合国宪章的。这一条约是向欧洲所有的国家打开着大门的，这一点就有力地表明了我们对于各种不同社会、政治制度的国家可以和平共处和合作的信念。
    墨西哥外交部长纳孚对四国政府首脑会议的召开表示欢迎。他说：“要解决一切问题，首先是确立持久和平的问题，就需要解决一个基本问题：各大国之间达成协议。……即将举行的四国政府首脑会议是一件很有希望的事情。可能，各国人民所期待的达成协议的时机已经到来了。”
    法国代表团团长比内说，联合国“首先”应该“集中力量来解决裁军及和平使用原子能的问题”。他说，“最近几个月来，在裁军方面做了很多工作”，各方“都在努力寻求一个各国都能接受的新的方案”。比内为北大西洋集团辩护，硬说这一集团的活动“不会加紧国际紧张局势”。
    白俄罗斯外交部长基谢廖夫说，至今还有许多国家在联合国中没有代表，这种情况妨碍联合国的正常工作。联合国中没有中华人民共和国，就使得最重大的国际问题，尤其是有关亚洲和远东的问题，难于顺利解决。基谢廖夫谈到裁军问题时说，现在问题的关键不在于苏联，而在于西方国家，西方国家应该同意不使用原子武器和氢武器，同意完全禁止这种武器。爱好和平的各国人民正在期待着西方国家采取这一步骤，期待着不在嘴上说而是要实际去做。
    泰国代表那拉底亲王发言说，从联合国宪章的基本原则和万隆亚非会议所通过的十项原则出发，“国同国之间的任何意识形态上的不同都不能排斥在它们之间建立和平关系的可能性”。
    荷兰外交大臣伦斯发言时反映了殖民国家对亚非各国日益壮大的民族解放运动所感到的不安。
    挪威代表团团长、挪威商务大臣斯科格在发言中呼吁各国代表们更加积极地利用联合国作为“改善国际关系的工具”。
