Make Full Use of Temporary Sheds
Wang Pu
    The Ministry of Railways recently decided to upgrade some of the existing temporary sheds on basic construction sites into formal houses, and hand them over to the operating railway units for use when the railway project is completed and put into operation. Construction units are not allowed to demolish them arbitrarily; and it was decided to re-regulate the construction standards of temporary sheds. This decision is correct.
    Temporary sheds, as the name suggests, are temporary buildings. After the completion of the project, they will have completed their mission. However, many construction units build temporary sheds that are excessively elaborate, and they have actually become permanent or semi-permanent buildings. The 30,000 square meters of temporary sheds built by the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways in the first half of last year all used wooden structures, and were also paved with cement and brick floors. The walls were all whitewashed, and the cost per square meter was as high as 41 yuan; even temporary toilets cost as much as 40 yuan per square meter. It is estimated that these so-called "temporary sheds" and "temporary toilets" can be used for at least 20 years. Local residents, based on their own construction standards, believe that "they may not collapse for a hundred years."
    It is obviously a waste to build temporary sheds so elaborately. What is more serious is that many units demolish all of these temporary sheds regardless of whether they are still useful. For example, after the completion of the project in the Gulang area by the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, the Gulang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Gansu Province requested to buy a batch of temporary sheds for use as offices. However, the construction unit ignored this in order to recover the wood and glass, and took the liberty of dismantling the doors, windows, and roof frames. It seems that the construction unit recovered the wood and glass, which can be used for new temporary sheds, as if to save investment for the country; but in fact, it is the biggest waste. Houses built by the state at a cost of tens of yuan per square meter, which can be used for a considerable period of time, are thus demolished. Can the loss be compensated by the construction unit recovering a little wood and glass? On the one hand, the usable sheds are demolished, and on the other hand, units that need houses, such as the Gulang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, have to build new houses, which requires another investment; operating railway units will also need state investment to build staff dormitories here in the future. What is the need for one unit to demolish perfectly good houses, and another unit to rebuild them soon after?
    With the development of the country's construction industry, the shortage of houses has become a common phenomenon. In order to concentrate its efforts on developing heavy industry, the state cannot invest heavily in general housing construction. In this case, making full use of existing temporary sheds and transferring them to production units along with production equipment after the completion of the project, or handing them over to other units in need, is a good way to save state investment and is a measure that is completely in line with the interests of the state and the masses.
    All competent departments should, like the Ministry of Railways, inspect the construction of temporary sheds. In future construction, formal houses should be built first instead of temporary sheds, so as to save all the expenses. If it is necessary to build temporary sheds, the cost per square meter should be reduced as much as possible. As for the existing temporary sheds, after the completion of the project, except for those that are indeed unusable, they should be transferred to the production units for use as much as possible along with the production equipment.

### 充分利用临时工棚

    充分利用临时工棚
    王朴
    铁道部最近决定把一些基本建设工地原有的临时工棚升级为正式房屋，在将来铁路工程完工交付营业时，一并交给营业铁路单位使用，施工单位不准任意拆除；并决定重新规定临时工棚的建筑标准。这个决定是正确的。
    临时工棚，顾名思义就是临时性的建筑。工程完工后，也就完成了自己的任务。可是，却有许多施工单位把临时工棚建设得过分讲究，实际上已经变成永久性或半永久性的建筑了。铁道部第六工程局去年上半年修建的三万平方公尺临时工棚，全部采用木结构，还铺了水泥地坪、青砖地坪，墙壁上都用白粉刷过，每平方公尺造价高达四十一元；甚至临时厕所，每平方公尺的造价也高达四十元。这些所谓“临时工棚”、“临时厕所”，据估计至少可以使用二十年，当地的居民根据自己的建筑标准来衡量，认为“一百年也不一定倒塌”。
    把临时工棚建造得这样讲究，显然是一种浪费。而更严重的，是有许多单位不管这些临时工棚还有用没有，都一律拆除。例如铁道部第一工程局在古浪地区的工程完工后，中共甘肃古浪县委会要求出钱买一批临时工棚作办公室，施工单位为了回收木材、玻璃，竟置之不理，迳自把门窗和屋架拆走了。看来，施工单位回收了木材、玻璃，可以用到新的临时工棚上去，好像是为国家节省了投资；实际上却是最大的浪费。国家在每个平方公尺上花了几十元建造起来的、可以相当长时期使用下去的房屋，就这样拆掉。这个损失，难道是施工单位回收一点木材和玻璃能够抵偿的吗？一方面把可用的工棚拆除了，另一方面诸如中共古浪县委会等需要房屋的单位还得另建房屋，又需要一笔投资；营业铁路单位将来在这里经营运输业务，也需要国家投资另建职工宿舍。有什么必要让这一个单位把好好的房子拆掉，另一个单位不久再来重新建造呢？
    随着国家建设事业的发展，房屋供不应求已成为一个普遍的现象。国家为了集中力量发展重工业，不可能大量投资于一般房屋建筑。在这种情况下，充分利用现有的临时工棚，在工程完工后随同生产设备移交给生产单位，或交给其他需用单位使用，这是节约国家投资的一个好办法，是完全符合国家利益和群众利益的措施。
    各个主管部门也应该像铁道部一样，检查临时工棚的建造情况。在今后的建设中，能够先造正式房屋的，应该先造正式房屋代替临时工棚，全部节省这笔费用。必须建造临时工棚的，也应该尽可能地降低每平方公尺的造价。至于现有的临时工棚，在工程完工后，除了确已不能使用的外，应尽可能随同生产设备移交生产单位使用。
