    Advancing Together in the Competition
    Qing Ping
    On the evening of April 15th, the office of the copper electrolysis workshop at the Kunming Smelter was packed with dozens of workers. They were from Team B and Team C, competitors in the labor competition, as well as close comrades and friends who helped and learned from each other. Now, they were sitting together, exchanging experiences from the labor competition.
    In the past, Team C was a relatively backward team, failing to comprehensively meet state targets on multiple occasions. In early April, the workers of this team, united around the Communist Party members, worked hard to improve their work and finally became the winners of the entire workshop's competition. How could they most quickly share their experience with Team B? This was the question that the workers of Team C cared about most.
    Zhang Guomin, the shift leader of Team C, knew best the reasons for his team's progress. Before the meeting, he had organized his team's experiences, and now, he was the first to introduce the team's production experience. He said, "Our relatively good completion of the production tasks in early April was mainly due to the leadership of the Party and everyone's efforts, and the sense of responsibility of every comrade in the team improved. For example, in the past, it was stipulated that the starter sheets had to be strictly inspected, and no unqualified ones were allowed. However, the comrades responsible for inspecting the starter sheets did not understand the harm that would be caused by using unqualified starter sheets for production, so they always inspected them carelessly. As a result, before March, the appearance quality of electrolytic copper was poor. Later, we organized everyone to visit and experiment, and the concrete facts made everyone understand the importance of strict inspection. We carried out production based on our experimental experience, and the number of cases where the appearance quality of the products failed to meet the standards was greatly reduced." He went on to cite many more examples to prove the importance of controlling technical conditions. Then, the washing tank workers of Team C also introduced their experiences.
    These experiences immediately attracted the attention of Team B workers. Zhao Jiashun, the shift leader of Team B, said, "The labor competition is to comprehensively complete the state plan by having the advanced drive the backward. I used to be not humble and only wanted to come up with my own set of experiences for others to learn, and I was unwilling to learn from the experiences created by other teams. This exchange of experience has educated me, and we should establish an overall concept and learn from each other in the future."
    After this meeting, some workers in Team B still did not believe that following the example would be beneficial. However, the shift leader and the activists in the team understood the importance of learning from Team C's experience. In order to make every worker believe in the benefits of advanced experience, they organized the entire team to actually visit and analyze the reasons. After everyone's visit, the shift leader said, "The electrolytic copper in our team has blisters because the comrades who put the starter sheets into the electrolytic tank were careless and pried the starter sheets. Wherever it is pried up, blisters will grow there. Team C requires strictness, and both the workers who flatten the starter sheets and the workers who put the starter sheets guarantee not to pry the sheets and supervise each other, so their team rarely has blistered electrolytic copper." The workers of Team B also felt that this analysis was very reasonable, so they started to follow suit. Sure enough, after one cycle, when the electrolytic copper was taken out to look at, it proved that Team C's experience was effective. As a result of learning from Team C's experience, the appearance quality of the electrolytic copper was improved, and the number of unqualified products was reduced from ninety-seven in early April to seventy-five in mid-April.
    Since Team C's experience reached Team B, the workers who control the temperature of the electrolyte also had ways to keep the electrolyte temperature normal. Before the exchange of experiences, the workers in Team B who measured the voltage found that the voltage was too high and did not meet the specifications on the technical condition cards, but there was no way to lower the voltage. Now, they have learned Team C's method and kept the voltage normal and stable. Therefore, the production of Team B is gradually improving.
    The exchange of experience has enriched the content of the entire workshop's labor competition and promoted the development of production. Many workers have realized that advanced driving the backward is a principle that must be followed in the labor competition. (Originally published in Yunnan Daily)

    在竞赛中一同前进
    清平
    四月十五日黄昏，在昆明冶炼厂铜电解车间的办公室里，挤着几十个工人。他们是乙、丙两班，是劳动竞赛的对手，也是互相帮助、互相学习的亲近的同志和朋友。现在，他们坐在一起交流自己在劳动竞赛中的经验。
    过去，丙班是比较落后的一个班，多次都没有全面完成国家指标。四月上旬，这个班的工人团结在共产党员们的周围，努力改进工作，终于成了全车间竞赛的优胜者。怎么让自己的经验最迅速地交流给乙班呢？这是丙班工人们最关心的一个问题。
    丙班值班主任张国民最清楚他们全班进步的原因。会前，他整理好了自己班上的经验，现在，他就第一个把全班的生产经验介绍出来。他说：“我们在四月上旬完成生产任务比较好，主要是依靠党的领导和大家的努力，全班每个同志的责任感提高了。比如：过去规定要严格检验始极片，不允许有不合规定的。但是，负责检验始极片的同志不懂得用不合格的始极片生产究竟有什么坏处，总是马马虎虎地检验。因此三月份以前，电解铜外形质量差。后来，我们组织大家参观、实验，具体的事实使大家懂得要严格检验的道理。根据我们实验的经验进行生产，产品外形质量不及格的情况就减少得多了。”他谈到这里，又接连举出了很多事例证明控制技术条件的重要。接着，丙班洗槽工人也介绍了自己的经验。
    这些经验立即吸引了乙班工人的注意。乙班值班主任赵家顺说：“劳动竞赛是通过先进带动落后来全面完成国家计划的，我过去不虚心，只想自己搞出一套经验让人家学习，不愿学习别班创造的经验。这次交流经验教育了我，今后我们应该树立整体观念，互相学习。”
    乙班工人们在这次会后，有些工人还不相信照着做会有好处。但是，值班主任和班里的积极分子懂得了学习丙班经验的重要。他们为了使每个工人都相信先进经验的好处，就组织全班工人实际参观，分析原因。值班主任在大家参观后说：“我们班的电解铜长疱疱，是因为放始极片到电解槽里的同志不小心，把始极片搞撬了，那个地方撬起，那里就会长疱疱。人家丙班要求严格，打平始极片的工人和放始极片的工人都保证不把片子搞撬，互相监督，所以他们班很少有长疱疱的电解铜。”乙班工人也觉得这种分析很合理，于是开始照着做。一点也不假，经过一个周期，把电解铜取出来看，证明丙班的经验是有效的。由于他们学习丙班的经验，电解铜的外形质量提高了，不合格品由上旬的九十七块减到中旬的七十五块。
    自从丙班的经验到了乙班以后，控制电解液温度的工人们也有办法使电解液温度保持正常了。在没有交流经验以前，乙班量电压的工人发现电压太高，不合技术条件卡片的规定，但是没有办法使电压降低。现在，他们学习了丙班的办法，使电压保持了正常平稳。因此，乙班的生产在逐步好转着。
    经验交流丰富了全车间劳动竞赛的内容，推动了生产向前发展。很多工人都体会到：先进带动落后是劳动竞赛中一个必须遵守的原则。                            （原载云南日报）
