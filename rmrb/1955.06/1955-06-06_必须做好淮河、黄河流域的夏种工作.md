    We Must Do a Good Job of Summer Planting in the Huaihe and Yellow River Basins

    The farmers in the Huaihe and Yellow River basins are now facing a tense summer planting season. It has an important impact on whether this year's national agricultural production increase plan can be completed. The national agricultural production increase target for this year is to increase total grain output by 20 billion jin compared to 1954, and oilseed production by about one-third compared to 1954. However, during this year's spring plowing season, there were many rural work tasks, and the spring-sown crops in some areas were not planted meticulously enough; in addition, some areas suffered from natural disasters such as frost and drought, rape was damaged by frost, and the sowing tasks for some spring-sown crops were not completed. Therefore, we must do our best to plant summer crops well and strive to fully complete this year's agricultural production increase plan.

    The Huaihe and Yellow River basins are the main wheat-producing areas in our country, and also one of the main producing areas of miscellaneous grains and oilseeds. Most of these two regions implement a two-year, three-crop system. After the wheat harvest each year, about two-thirds or more of the wheat fields, that is, more than 200 million mu of cultivated land, must be replanted with late autumn crops, mainly miscellaneous grains and oil crops. These two regions are generally low-yielding grain crop areas, and the grain harvested each year is never enough to meet the needs of the local people. Making the greatest effort to do a good job in summer planting in these areas is not only of great help to completing this year's agricultural production increase tasks, especially the increase in grain and oilseed production; it is also of great significance for solving the grain supply problem in these two areas.

    The time for summer planting is very short, and the farm work during this period is very crowded. The spring sowing time in the Huaihe and Yellow River basins can often last for more than a month, but the suitable time for summer planting is only about half a month. Moreover, the summer planting tasks are carried out simultaneously with thinning and weeding, pest control, and summer harvesting and cleaning work, which can easily hinder and affect each other. Therefore, properly arranging the various farm activities during this stage is a prerequisite for smoothly completing the summer planting task. The county Party committees and county people's committees of each county should distinguish the importance and urgency of each farm activity during the summer planting stage, and formulate specific production plans. Matters that can be handled later should be postponed until after summer planting, and only matters that must be handled urgently should be listed before summer planting, and guide the farmers to do them separately; we must cherish the farmers' production time, and all activities that are not related or not closely related to summer planting should be postponed until after summer planting. Whether the sowing of summer crops is timely has a great impact on the level of yield. According to experiments by the Nanyang Special District Farm in Henan, under the same cultivation management conditions, corn sown on June 27 (the local farmers' customary sowing period) yielded 332 jin per mu, while corn sown on June 6 increased production by 57 percent, corn sown on June 13 increased production by 15 percent, and corn sown on July 2 decreased production by 13 percent. The same is true for sweet potatoes transplanted after the wheat harvest. Early transplanting yields one-third more than late transplanting.

    Agricultural producers' cooperatives should rationally organize labor, overcome the difficulties of crowded farm work, and plant all summer-sown crops well. This is not only an important way to increase the income of agricultural cooperatives, but also a good opportunity for them to demonstrate their superiority to the farmers; only in this way can they play a leading role in summer planting.

    An important difficulty in this year's summer planting is that some farmers lack seeds and fertilizers. Some areas in the Huaihe and Yellow River basins suffered floods last year, and some farmers ate the seeds as food in the spring. From past experience, seeds are an important factor determining the size of the summer planting area and the quality of summer planting. Therefore, solving the seed problem should be listed as one of the main items in the summer planting preparation work. In general areas, the basic method of solving the seed shortage problem is to mobilize the masses to adjust each other. In addition to farmers raising their own funds, local agricultural production leading departments are responsible for organizing the supply of seeds in disaster areas; the supply and transfer of seeds should be done sooner rather than later to avoid delaying the farming season. The previous crops of summer crops are mostly wheat fields, and the soil fertility is not high, so as much fertilizer as possible should be applied. However, fertilizer is quite scarce this year. Farmers have accumulated some fertilizer from after spring sowing to before summer planting, but it is estimated that it is still insufficient; the method of fertilization should be improved to maximize the effect of the existing fertilizer. Experience has proved that when applying base fertilizer, changing broadcast application to strip application can increase the fertilizer effect by more than two times. This method can be tested and adopted in various places. At the same time, we must make full use of the gaps in farm work to step up fertilizer accumulation so as to be used as topdressing for summer-sown crops.

    In order to ensure the good growth of summer crops, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance to farmers. The agricultural technology extension stations in various places should lead farmers to carefully select seeds and implement seed soaking and seed dressing to ensure the quality of sowing and prevent missing seedlings. When sowing in the spring of this year, many areas experienced widespread missing seedlings due to rough sowing. This lesson must be remembered. Rationally utilizing land and appropriately increasing the number of crop plants in summer-sown fields is an important method of increasing production. Summer-sown corn and sweet potatoes have a relatively short growing period and should be appropriately densely planted. Under normal circumstances, the number of corn plants per mu can be increased to 3,000 to 4,000, and the number of sweet potatoes can be increased to 3,000. Farmers in most areas do not have the experience of appropriately increasing the number of crop plants in summer-sown fields, and the technology extension stations should help and guide them. This summer, a large amount of soybeans will be planted in the Huaihe and Yellow River basins. In areas where soybean rhizobium inoculant can be supplied, the agricultural technology extension stations should publicize the benefits of rhizobium inoculant to farmers and teach the technology of inoculation in order to overcome the difficulty of fertilizer shortage.

    In order to increase grain production, it is necessary to actively promote the planting of high-yielding corn and sweet potatoes. However, when promoting it, we must consider local conditions and the farmers' habits of rational crop rotation (that is, changing the stubble). It is wrong to use coercive orders to force farmers to plant a certain crop. According to the experience of many areas, intercropping corn and beans produces a higher total yield than monoculture of corn or beans; at the same time, because leguminous crops have nitrogen-fixing effect, it is also beneficial to the next crop. This practice can also change the local farmers' habit of not wanting to plant corn, and other areas with conditions can also promote this practice.

    This year, many areas in the Huaihe and Yellow River basins should also increase the area of summer-sown sesame. Farmers in some wheat-producing areas in Shaanxi and Shanxi often do not want to replant after a bumper wheat harvest. This year, the wheat in these areas is growing well, and this idea of not wanting to replant has occurred again. Farmers should be educated to gradually change this habit and explain to them that appropriately increasing the replanting area is beneficial to both the country and themselves. The Longju Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, implemented wheat field replanting last year and harvested a total of 51,000 jin of autumn grain, which is a good example.

    During the summer planting season, rural work is busy. The busier the work, the more specific leadership should be strengthened for the farmers, and they should be effectively helped to solve various difficult problems to ensure the overfulfillment of the summer planting plan.

### 必须做好淮河、黄河流域的夏种工作

    必须做好淮河、黄河流域的夏种工作
    淮河和黄河流域的农民，现在面临着紧张的夏种季节。它对于今年全国农业增产计划的能否完成是有重要影响的。全国今年农业增产指标，粮食总产量要比一九五四年增产二百亿斤，油料要比一九五四年增产三分之一左右。但在今年春耕期间，农村工作任务很多，各地都有一些春播作物种得不够精细；加以部分地区遭受了霜冻、干旱等自然灾害的袭击，油菜受冻，有些春播作物的播种任务没有完成。因此，我们必须把夏种作物尽力种好，争取今年农业增产计划全面完成。
    淮河和黄河流域是我国主要的产麦区，也是我国杂粮和油料的主要产区之一。这两个区域大部实行两年三熟耕作制，每年麦收以后，约有三分之二以上的麦田，即二亿亩以上的耕地，要回种晚秋作物，其中主要是杂粮和油料作物。这两个区域一般是粮食作物低产区，每年收获的粮食，总是不够本地人民的需要。尽最大的力量把这一地区的夏种工作做好，不仅对完成今年的农业增产任务，特别是粮食和油料的增产任务有很大作用；对于解决这两个区域的粮食供应问题，也有重要的意义。
    夏种的时间是非常短促的，这一时期的农活又是非常拥挤的。淮河和黄河流域的春播时间，常常可以延续到一个月以上，而夏种的适宜时间却不过半个月光景。而且，夏种任务是同间苗锄草、防治虫害和夏收清理工作同时进行的，很容易互相牵掣和影响。因此，妥善地安排这一阶段的各项农活，乃是顺利完成夏种任务的先决条件。各县的县委和县人民委员会要分别夏种阶段各项农事活动的轻重缓急，订出具体的生产计划，可以缓办的事应该推迟到夏种以后，必须急办的事才列在夏种之前，领导农民分别做好；一定要珍惜农民的生产时间，凡是同夏种没有关系或关系不大的活动，都应该推迟到夏种以后去做。夏种作物播种是否适时，对产量的高低影响极大。据河南南阳专区农场的试验，在同样的栽培管理条件下，六月二十七日播种的（当地农民习惯的播种期）玉米每亩收获三百三十二斤，六月六日播种的增产百分之五十七，六月十三日播种的增产百分之十五，而七月二日播种的减产百分之十三。麦收后扦插的甘薯也是这样，早插的要比迟插的增产三分之一。
    农业生产合作社要合理地组织劳动，克服农活拥挤的困难，把夏播作物全部种好。这不仅是增加农业社的收入的重要办法，而且是它运用本身的优越条件向农民示范的良好时机；只有这样，它才能在夏种中起带头作用。
    今年夏种中的一个重要困难是有些农民缺乏种籽和肥料。淮河、黄河两流域的部分地区去年发生水灾，有些农民在春季把种籽作为食粮吃掉了。而从历年的经验看来，种籽是决定夏种面积大小和夏种质量好坏的重要因素。因此，解决种籽问题，应该列为夏种准备工作的主要项目之一。在一般地区，解决缺种问题的基本办法是发动群众互相调剂。灾区缺少的种籽，除农民自行筹集以外，当地的农业生产领导部门有责任组织供应；供应和调运种籽，宜早不宜迟，以免延误农时。夏种作物的前茬多是麦田，地力不厚，应该尽量多施肥料。但今年肥料相当缺乏，春播以后到夏种以前，农民已积聚部分肥料，估计仍然是不足用的；应该改进施肥方法，使现有的肥料发生最大的作用。经验证明，在施用基肥的时候，改撒施为条施，可以增加肥效二倍以上。这种办法各地都可试验采用。同时要尽量利用农事间隙加紧积肥，以便作为夏播作物的追肥。
    为了保证夏种作物生长良好，必须对农民加强技术指导。各地的农业技术推广站要领导农民精选种籽并实行浸种、拌种，以保证播种质量，防止缺苗。今年春季播种的时候，许多地区由于播种粗糙，普遍发生缺苗现象，这种教训必须记取。合理利用土地，适当增加夏种田的作物株数，是一项重要的增产办法。夏种玉米、甘薯的生长期比较短，应该适当实行密植。按一般情况，玉米每亩株数可增到三千到四千株，甘薯可增到三千株。多数地区的农民没有在夏种田中适当增加作物株数的经验，技术推广站要对他们进行帮助和指导。今年夏季淮河、黄河两流域要种植大量的黄豆，在能够供应大豆根瘤菌拌种剂的地区，农业技术推广站应该向农民宣传根瘤菌拌种的好处和传授拌种的技术，以克服缺肥的困难。
    为了提高粮食的产量，积极提倡多种高产量的玉米和甘薯是必要的。但在推广的时候，必须考虑当地条件和农民对耕地的合理轮作（即倒换茬口）的习惯。用强迫命令的方法让农民多种某种作物的作法是错误的。据许多地区的经验，玉米和豆类作物间作，总产量比单种玉米或豆类作物都高；同时由于豆科作物有固氮作用，对下茬作物也有好处。这种作法还可以改变当地农民不愿种玉米的习惯，其他有条件的地区也可以提倡这种做法。
    今年淮河、黄河流域不少地区还应该增加夏种芝麻的面积。陕西、山西部分产麦区的农民在小麦丰收后常常不愿回茬。今年这些地区的小麦生长不坏，这种不愿回茬的思想又发生了。应该教育农民逐步改变这种习惯，向他们说明：适当增加回茬面积，对国家对自己都有好处。山西解虞县龙居村农业生产合作社去年实行麦田回茬，共收获五万一千斤秋粮，就是很好的例子。
    在夏种期间，农村工作是繁忙的。工作越是繁忙，对农民越要加强具体领导，切实帮助他们解决各种疑难问题，保证超额完成夏种计划。
