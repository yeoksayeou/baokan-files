    Three Million Yuan Flying Out of the Chimney Every Year
    To the Editor:
    There are several peculiar chimneys in Tangshan City that spew out a kind of ash-grey powder day and night. This powder not only affects production safety but also adds a lot of trouble to people's lives. Workers dare not stroll or drink tea in the courtyard in the dusty air. If it's windy season, even places ten or twenty miles away from Tangshan City have to close their curtains to prevent the invasion of this powder.
    Where does this powder come from? It turns out that it is emitted from the jointly owned Tangshan Qixin Cement Factory. This powder is none other than cement and raw material powder, valuable building materials.
    According to rough calculations, the cement and raw material powder that flies out of the chimneys of the rotary kiln and grinding mills of the Qixin Cement Factory accounts for about 10% of the daily output. The cement lost in one year could build 264,700 square meters of concrete buildings. That is to say, more than three million yuan worth of RMB flies out of the Qixin Cement Factory's chimneys every year. Of course, these losses are included in the cost, so the cost of some national buildings has increased due to the use of cement from the Qixin Cement Factory. The dust from the Qixin Cement Factory has a great impact on the health of employees. In 1954, 789 employees suffered from occupational diseases such as bronchitis and asthma, losing 15,597 workdays, and the loss in wages alone was 37,432 yuan.
    The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Bureau of Building Materials Industry instructed the Qixin Cement Factory to solve this problem long ago. However, for a long time, the leadership has not paid enough attention to implementing the technical instructions of the higher authorities on vigorously preventing dust, and it has not been resolved until now. The installation of dust removal equipment has long been approved, but the leaders of the Qixin Cement Factory have repeatedly emphasized the difficulties, and even the design work has not been actively carried out, nor is there anyone specifically responsible for restoring the original dust removal equipment.
    We remind the leaders of the Qixin Cement Factory: Wasting the people's wealth is a crime against the country and the people. You must take immediate measures to correct this phenomenon of wasting national wealth and hindering people's health.

### 每年从烟囱里飞掉三百万元

    每年从烟囱里飞掉三百万元编辑同志：
    唐山市有这么几个古怪的大烟囱，夜以继日地吐散出一种草灰色的粉末，这种粉末，不但影响到生产的安全，同时也给人们的生活添了很多苦恼。工人们在粉末的空气里，不敢在院子里散步、喝茶。要是遇到刮风季节，远离唐山市东西一、二十里的地方，在屋里都得拉上窗帘，防止这一股子粉末的侵袭。
    这种粉末究竟从那里来的呢？原来它是从公私合营唐山启新水泥工厂散放出来的，这种粉末不是别的，而是一种建筑用的贵重材料——水泥和生料粉。
    根据粗略的计算，启新水泥工厂每天从回转窑的烟囱和磨机里飞散出来的水泥、生料粉，约占日产量百分之十，一年飞散的水泥就可以建筑二十六万四千七百平方公尺的混凝土建筑物。这就是说，每年从启新水泥工厂烟囱里要飞掉人民币三百多万元。当然，这些损失都是计入了成本的，因此国家某些建筑物由于使用了启新水泥厂的水泥，造价也就增加了。启新水泥厂的粉尘对职工的健康影响很大。一九五四年职工患气管炎、气喘等职业病的就有七百八十九人次，损失一万五千五百九十七个工作日，只是工资一项就损失三万七千四百三十二元。
    中央重工业部建筑材料工业管理局早就指示启新水泥厂解决这个问题；但是，长期以来，由于领导上对于贯彻上级大力防尘工作的技术指示，重视不足，直到现在还没有解决。上级早已批准安装吸尘设备，可是启新水泥工厂的领导人员却一再强调困难，连设计工作都没有积极进行，对于恢复原有的吸尘设备工作，也没有专人负责。
    我们提醒启新水泥工厂的领导人员：浪费人民的财富是对国家和人民的一种罪过，你们必须立即采取措施，纠正这种浪费国家财富和妨碍人们健康的现象。
