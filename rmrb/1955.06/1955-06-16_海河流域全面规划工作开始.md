Comprehensive Planning Work for the Hai River Basin Begins

    In order to fundamentally control floods in the Hai River Basin and further develop and utilize its water and land resources, the Ministry of Water Resources has begun comprehensive planning work for the Hai River Basin. The entire planning work will be completed by 1957. In early March this year, the Beijing Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources and other relevant units transferred a large number of technical personnel and organized survey teams for river courses, soil and water conservation, hydrology, irrigation, and drainage to conduct on-site investigations and collect data for each river system. Based on the results of the investigations, they will propose temporary flood and waterlogging prevention measures for each river this year, as well as permanent flood prevention measures for the Hutuo River in the Ziya River system.

    The Hai River is the largest river system in North China, including the five major tributaries of the North Grand Canal, Yongding River, Daqing River, Ziya River, and South Grand Canal, with a drainage area of approximately 240,000 square kilometers. The general characteristics of each river are that the upstream tributaries are numerous, with steep slopes and rapid flows, resulting in large water volumes; the downstream mainstreams have narrow river channels, gentle slopes and slow flows, and small discharge capacities. Coupled with the influence of climatic conditions, the Hai River Basin often experiences droughts in the spring due to lack of rain and snow, while in the autumn, concentrated heavy rainfall causes rivers to swell rapidly, easily leading to floods and disasters. Therefore, it has a significant impact on agricultural production in the basin, especially in Hebei Province, and sometimes even threatens the safety of important cities and transportation lines. In recent years, although the state has built many water conservancy projects to manage the Hai River, most of them are only stopgap measures and cannot completely prevent floods. After the completion of this Hai River Basin plan, it will provide a design basis for fundamental control projects for each river and fundamentally eliminate the threat of floods in the Hai River.

    海河流域全面规划工作开始
    为了根治海河流域水灾和进一步开发利用海河流域的水利和土地资源，水利部已开始着手进行海河流域的规划工作。全部规划工作，将在一九五七年内完成。今年三月初，水利部北京勘测设计院和其他有关单位抽调了大批技术人员，组织了河道、水土保持、水文、灌溉排水等勘察队，分别到各河系勘查搜集资料，并根据勘查的结果，提出今年各河的临时的防洪、防涝措施和子牙河系滹沱河的永久性的防洪措施。
    海河是华北地区最大的河系，包括北运河、永定河、大清河、子牙河、南运河五大干流，流域面积约有二十四万平方公里。各河的一般特点是上游支流多，坡陡流急，来水量大；下游干流河槽狭窄，坡平流缓，泄水量小，加以气候条件的影响，每年春季海河流域的地区常因雨雪缺少，发生干旱现象，而秋季又因暴雨集中，河道宣泄不及致使洪水暴涨，极易泛滥成灾。因此，对流域内特别是河北省的农业生产影响很大，有时甚至威胁重要城市和交通干线的安全。这几年来，国家虽然修建了许多治理海河的水利工程，但多是治标性的，不能完全避免水灾。这次海河流域规划完成后，将能提供各河治本工程的设计依据，根治海河水患。　（林烽）
