Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 3rd: New York morning papers prominently published the Soviet-Yugoslav joint declaration. The papers' Washington correspondents also reported on reactions to the conclusion of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks. These reactions demonstrate that certain American figures are not only dissatisfied with the results of the talks but also with the talks themselves.

Reporters and commentators made various conjectures and speculations about the role of the talks and their impact on the international situation. These conjectures and speculations revealed the intentions of the US diplomatic authorities: they do not regard Yugoslavia as an independent and autonomous factor on the international stage but as a country that must follow US foreign policy.

Some newspapers' comments revealed poorly concealed threats and hints that the US might resort to economic pressure. Due to the recall of the US Ambassador to Belgrade for "reporting," some newspapers believe that the US, Britain, and France will hold talks with Yugoslavia in the near future.

A Reuters reporter reported from Washington: "The joint Soviet-Yugoslav declaration upholding Communist China's right to Taiwan and its admission to the United Nations has caused surprise and some disappointment among Washington officials and members of Congress."

The reporter went on to point out that there is a strong trend among members of Congress to demand pressure on Yugoslavia. Senator Homer Capehart (Republican), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the declaration "will not promote Tito's relationship with the United States."

Associated Press commentator William Ryan complained that the declaration "supports the Soviet Communist and worldwide Communist positions on both the German and Chinese issues."

    美国统治集团不满苏南会谈结果
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社纽约三日讯：纽约各晨报以显著地位刊载苏南两国政府宣言。各报驻华盛顿记者还报道了对苏南会谈结束的反应，这些反应证明某些美国人士不仅不满意苏南会谈结果，而且不满意会谈本身。
    记者们和评论员们对会谈的作用和会谈对国际局势的影响作了种种揣测和臆想。这些揣测和臆想流露出美国外交当局的心意：它不是把南斯拉夫看作国际舞台上一个独立自主的因素，而是把它看作一个必须跟着美国外交政策走的国家。
    有些报纸的言论流露出掩饰得不好的威胁和暗示，说美国方面可能采取经济的压力。由于美国驻贝尔格莱德大使奉召返国“报告”，有一些报纸认为美、英、法三国将在最近将来同南斯拉夫举行会谈。
    路透社记者从华盛顿报道说：“苏、南两国联合宣布维护共产党中国对台湾的权利和接受它进入联合国，这引起了华盛顿官方人士和国会人士的惊奇和某种失望。”
    这个记者接着指出：在国会人士中可以看出有一种要求对南斯拉夫施压力的强烈趋向。参议院外交委员会委员、参议员霍默·凯普哈特（共和党）说，这个宣言“不会促进铁托同美国的关系”。
    美联社评论员威廉·雷扬抱怨说，这个宣言“在德国问题和中国问题上都是支持苏联共产党和全世界共产党的立场的”。
