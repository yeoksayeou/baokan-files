    The Tongxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Should Seriously Handle the Incident of Suppressing Criticism

    In February and March of this year, residents of Dengjiayao Village, Gongzhufen Township, Eighth District, Tongxian County, Hebei Province, reported to our newspaper's visitors' room that Dong Defu, the secretary of the township party branch, was engaging in illegal and undisciplined behavior and shielding bad people. After investigation and verification by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Tongxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, it was decided on April 25th to give Dong Defu the punishment of dismissal from his post. However, as of May 14th, the Eighth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Tongxian County had not yet implemented this decision. Dong Defu was still relying on his power to oppress those who criticized him.

    Li Zhensheng, a staff member of the Tongxian Special District Cinema, actively assisted the masses in reporting Dong Defu and therefore became the target of oppression. On one occasion (April 10th), Li Zhensheng went to Dengjiayao Village to collect materials on Dong Defu. When Dong Defu heard this news, he secretly discussed it with Township Head Wang Xing, District Staff Member Zhao Guangqing, and others, and decided to send Wang Xing to first question Li Zhensheng about whether he had a "letter of introduction." Then, he searched Li Zhensheng's person and took him to the Township People's Committee. Later, because they could not find any fault with Li Zhensheng, they sent Li Zhensheng back to the Tongxian Special District Cinema the next morning under the pretext of a "misunderstanding," escorted by militiamen.

    After the incident, Zhao Guangqing talked about it with Jiang Hongchun, Deputy Secretary of the District Committee. Comrade Jiang Hongchun not only did not point out the mistakes of Dong Defu and others, but also said without principle: "Since that person didn't have a letter of introduction, why didn't you tie him up and send him to the district!" On the afternoon of May 7th, Li Zhensheng went to the newspaper to complain about this matter, and the newspaper immediately wrote a letter asking the Discipline Inspection Committee of Tongxian County to handle it. On his way back, Li Zhensheng was met by Zhao Guangqing. Zhao Guangqing asked him again if he had a "letter of introduction" to the village. When Zhao Guangqing saw the newspaper's letter, he loudly rebuked Li Zhensheng, saying: "You went to Beijing to complain again, aren't you deliberately making trouble?" Then he called Jiang Hongchun, the Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, and sent Li Zhensheng to the district. That evening, Jiang Hongchun assigned a district civil affairs assistant to have an individual "talk" with Li until late at night. Because they still could not find any fault with Li Zhensheng, they released him under the pretext of "misunderstanding." As for the letter from the newspaper to the County Discipline Inspection Committee, it was withheld.

    Jiang Hongchun, Deputy Secretary of the Eighth District Party Committee, not only failed to correct the illegal actions of Dong Defu and others, but also listened one-sidedly, condoned and shielded certain district and township staff members, detained people and withheld letters, and fostered Dong Defu's serious mistakes of violating laws and discipline and systematically attacking critics.

    We hope that the Tongxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tongxian People's Committee will seriously handle this incident and give appropriate punishment to the relevant personnel who violated laws and discipline. 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Our Newspaper's Reader's Visiting Room

### 中共通县县委会应当严肃处理压制批评事件

    中共通县县委会应当严肃处理压制批评事件
    今年二、三月间，河北通县八区公主坟乡邓家窑村群众向本报来访室检举该乡党支部书记东德福违法乱纪、包庇坏人的行为。这件事，经过中共通县县委纪律检查委员会调查证实后，已在四月二十五日决定给东德福以撤销工作的处分。但是，直到五月十四日中共通县八区区委会还没有执行这个决定。东德福仍在依仗权势欺压批评他的人。
    通县专区电影院工作人员李振声是积极协助群众检举东德福的，因此，他就成为被欺压的对象。有一次（四月十日），李振声到邓家窑村搜集东德福的材料，东德福听到这个消息，就和乡长王兴、区工作人员赵广清等秘密商量，决定派王兴先去盘问李振声有没有“介绍信”，接着他又搜查了李振声的身上，以后就把李振声带到乡人民委员会。后来，因为他们找不出李振声有什么罪过，到第二天上午，才在“出于误会”的托词下，派民兵把李振声送回了通县专区电影院。
    事后，赵广清向区委副书记姜洪春谈过这件事，姜洪春同志不仅没有指出东德福等人的错误，反而毫无原则地说：“那个人既然没有介绍信，为什么不把他捆送到区里来！”五月七日下午，李振声到报社控诉这件事，报社随就写了一封信请中共通县纪律检查委员会处理。李振声在回去的路上又被赵广清遇见了。赵广清又问他到村里有没有“介绍信”。当赵广清一看到报社的信以后，就大声责备李振声说：你又到北京嘀咕去啦，这不是存心捣乱吗？接着就打电话告诉区委副书记姜洪春，把李振声送到区里去了。当天晚上，姜洪春指定区民政助理员和李个别“谈话”，直到深夜。因为仍然找不出李振声有什么错误，又在“误会”的托词下把他释放。至于报社给县委纪律检查委员会的信，却被扣留了。
    八区党委副书记姜洪春对于东德福等人的非法行为，不但没有加以纠正，反而偏听偏信，纵容和包庇某些区乡工作人员，扣人扣信，助长了东德福违法乱纪，有计划地打击批评者的严重错误。
    我们希望中共通县县委会和通县人民委员会严肃处理这个事件，并对违法乱纪的有关人员给以适当的处分。  　本报读者来访室
