Tongdao Dong Autonomous County is Flourishing

The largest Dong autonomous region in the country—Tongdao Dong Autonomous County in Hunan Province—is becoming increasingly prosperous. Now, state-owned commercial organizations and supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in many market towns. In the communities and villages inhabited by the Dong, Yao, and Miao ethnic groups, the "peddlers" of state-owned trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives have become frequent visitors.

Tongdao Dong Autonomous County was established on May 7, 1954. The autonomous county is located in southwestern Hunan Province. It has dense forests and is one of the timber producing areas in Hunan Province. The county has a population of more than 80,000, including Dong, Han, Miao, and Yao ethnic groups, with more than 50,000 Dong people. Farmers of all ethnic groups mostly engage in agricultural production. In recent years, with the help of the state, farmers of all ethnic groups have built many small reservoirs and ponds, expanding the irrigated area of paddy fields by six or seven thousand mu. When the autonomous county was first established, there was only one agricultural production cooperative in the county. Now, the county has developed to twenty-six agricultural production cooperatives and forestry production cooperatives, as well as more mutual aid teams, with about half of the farmers organized. In 1954, the county's rice production increased by 8.4 percent compared to 1953. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    通道侗族自治县日益繁荣
    全国最大的一个侗族自治区域——湖南省通道侗族自治县正日渐繁荣起来。现在，许多集镇上都设有国营商业机构和供销合作社，在侗族、瑶族和苗族聚居的团、寨里，国营贸易公司和供销合作社的“货郎担”成了经常来往的客人。
    通道侗族自治县是一九五四年五月七日成立的，自治县位于湖南省西南部。这里有茂密的森林，是湖南省木材产地之一。全县有八万多人口，包括侗、汉、苗、瑶等族，其中侗族有五万多人。各族农民大都从事农业生产。几年来，在国家的帮助下，各族农民兴修了许多小型水库和塘坝等，扩大了稻田灌溉面积六、七千亩。刚成立自治县时，全县只有一个农业生产合作社，现在全县已发展到二十六个农业生产合作社和林业生产合作社以及更多的互助组，组织起来的农户已有一半左右。一九五四年全县的稻谷产量比一九五三年增产了百分之八点四。  （据新华社讯）
