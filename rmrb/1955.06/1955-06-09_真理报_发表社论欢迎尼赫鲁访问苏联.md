Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 7th: TASS reports: "Pravda" published an editorial on July 7th entitled "May the Friendship Between the People of the Soviet Union and India Develop and Strengthen Daily!"

The editorial stated: The Head of Government of the Republic of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, will arrive in our country today. The Soviet people heartily welcome this outstanding son of our friend, the Indian people, and shout to him: Welcome!

The editorial cited historical facts to illustrate that the relations between the Soviet Union and India have always been friendly. In the struggle for a better future, they have always received each other's moral support.

The editorial said: The founder of the Communist Party and the Soviet state—the great Lenin—was deeply convinced of the creative power of the Indian people, and that their struggle for freedom and independence would surely be victorious. When the Soviet people learned that India, after decades of tenacious struggle, had finally overthrown colonial rule and embarked on the road of independent national development, they felt very satisfied. All this created the necessary prerequisites for further consolidating and expanding Soviet-Indian friendship.

The Indian people and the Soviet people have different national structures. Their social and political systems are also different. But the people of the Soviet Union and India have many things in common—they are both peace-loving people. Our common desire is to live in harmony and friendship with all countries. Both our countries advocate resolving international disputes peacefully through negotiations. This unites the people of the Soviet Union and India.

The editorial said: The joint efforts of the people of the Soviet Union and India, together with all other peace-loving people, for peace are producing positive results. Thanks to the very active participation of the Soviet Union and the Republic of India, two flames of war in Asia (in Korea and Indochina) were extinguished.

The Soviet people always give due consideration to the opinions expressed by Indian representatives at international conferences and international organizations on issues of peace in Asia and world peace. The Soviet public has always closely followed the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Indochina, headed by Indian representatives.

India has won the deep praise of all peace-loving people for its unwavering struggle, together with the Soviet Union, to restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations Organization. The satisfaction of this just demand of the People's Republic of China will not only promote the consolidation of peace in the Far East, but will also promote the consolidation of world peace, the easing of international tensions, and the enhancement of the role and prestige of the United Nations Organization.

Our two countries' opposition to military aggression blocs that threaten the people of all countries, the struggle to abolish these blocs, and the struggle to remove military bases on foreign territories also unite the people of our two countries and deepen mutual trust.

The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union deeply sympathize with the Indian people's struggle to liberate Indian territories still under the yoke of colonialism and to develop the national economy. The Soviet people express sympathy for the Indian government's efforts to develop its own industry, because their own experience tells them that industrialization is important for independent survival. Soviet men and women support the Indian people's struggle against racial discrimination, especially against the discrimination suffered by Indians within the Union of South Africa.

Mutual understanding and consolidated cooperation between the Soviet people and the Indian people are manifested in the struggle to save mankind from another disastrous war and to stop the arms race. The heavy burden of the arms race weighs on the shoulders of working people and is increasingly becoming an obstacle to improving the welfare of the people of all countries. For many years, the Soviet Union has advocated reducing and limiting armaments, prohibiting the manufacture and use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and advocating effective supervision of the implementation of these decisions. Soviet men and women are deeply gratified to note that the Indian people also advocate stopping the arms race, banning atomic and hydrogen weapons, reducing armaments, and conducting appropriate supervision.

The editorial emphasized: The friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and India are built on the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. These principles have been, and still are, firmly applied to the relations between the Soviet Union and the Republic of India.

The basis of the famous joint statement by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, and Nehru, Prime Minister of India, is these principles of peaceful coexistence. The ever-growing friendship between the people of the People's Republic of China and India is an invaluable contribution to world peace.

The editorial concluded that there is no doubt that the visit of Indian Prime Minister Nehru to the Soviet Union will promote the further consolidation of friendly relations between our two countries, will be conducive to the cause of universal peace, and will help to ease international tensions throughout the world.

    “真理报”发表社论欢迎尼赫鲁访问苏联
    新华社七日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”七日以“祝苏联和印度两国人民之间的友谊日益发展和巩固！”为题，发表了社论。
    社论说：印度共和国政府首脑贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁今天就要来到我国。苏联人民衷心欢迎我们的朋友印度人民的这位优秀的儿子，并且向他高呼：欢迎！
    社论举出历史事实说明苏联和印度的关系从来一直是友好的。他们在争取一个更好的未来的斗争中，一向得到对方的道义上的支持。
    社论说：共产党和苏维埃国家的缔造者——伟大的列宁深信印度人民的创造力量，深信他们争取自由和独立的斗争必然会胜利。当苏联人民得悉印度在进行了好几十年的顽强的斗争之后终于推翻了殖民政权，走上独立的民族发展的道路时，心中感到非常满意。所有这一切创造了进一步巩固和扩大苏印友谊的必要前提。
    印度人民和苏联人民有着不同的国家结构。他们的社会和政治制度也不相同。但是苏联和印度两国人民有许多共同的东西——他们都是热爱和平的人民。我们共同的愿望是同一切国家和睦友好地相处。我们两国都主张用和平方法、通过谈判来解决发生争执的国际问题。这就把苏联和印度两国人民团结在一起。
    社论说：苏联和印度两国人民同所有其他爱好和平的人民一起为争取和平所作的联合努力正在产生积极结果。由于苏联和印度共和国的十分积极的参加，亚洲两场战火（在朝鲜和印度支那）被扑灭了。
    苏联人民对印度代表们在国际会议和国际组织中就争取亚洲和平和世界和平的问题所表示的意见总是给予适当的评价。苏联公众始终密切注视着以印度代表为首的印度支那国际监督和监察委员会的活动。
    由于印度同苏联一起为恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的合法地位而进行坚持不渝的斗争，印度得到了一切爱好和平的人民的深深赞扬。中华人民共和国这种正当要求的满足不仅将促进远东和平的巩固，而且也将促进世界和平的巩固，促进国际紧张局势的缓和和联合国组织的作用和威信的提高。
    我们两国对威胁着各国人民的军事侵略集团所抱的反对态度，为争取取消这些集团所进行的斗争，为争取撤除在别国领土上的军事基地而进行的斗争，也使我们两国人民团结一致，并加深了相互的信任。
    苏联各族人民深切地同情印度人民为解放仍旧处在殖民主义枷锁下的印度领土和发展国民经济所进行的斗争。苏联人民对于印度政府旨在发展本国工业的努力表示同情，因为他们本身的经验告诉他们，工业化对独立的生存是很重要的。苏联男女支持印度人民反对种族歧视、特别是反对南非联邦境内的印度人所遭到的歧视的斗争。
    苏联人民和印度人民之间的相互谅解和巩固合作表现在争取人类免遭另一次灾难性战争和制止军备竞赛的斗争中。军备竞赛的沉重负担压在劳动人民的肩上，并且越来越成为阻碍各国人民福利提高的障碍。多年以来，苏联一向主张裁减和限制军备，禁止制造和使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，并且主张对这些决定的执行进行有效的监督。苏联男女深为满意地注意到，印度人民也主张停止军备竞赛，禁止原子武器和氢武器，裁减军备和进行适当的监督。
    社论着重指出：苏联和印度之间的友谊和合作是建筑在互相尊重领土完整和主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利和和平共处等项原则之上的。这些原则一直，并且现在仍然坚定不移地应用在苏联和印度共和国之间的关系上。
    中华人民共和国总理周恩来和印度总理尼赫鲁的著名的联合声明的基础就是这些和平共处的原则。中华人民共和国和印度两国人民之间的不断增长的友谊是对世界和平的一个无可估量的贡献。
    社论最后说，毫无疑问，印度总理尼赫鲁的访问苏联将促进我们两国间的友好关系的进一步巩固，将有利于普遍和平的目的，并且将有助于缓和全世界的国际紧张局势。
