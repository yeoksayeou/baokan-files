    Visiting the General Station of Aerial Forest Protection
    By our reporter Jin Yukun
    During the busy forest fire prevention season, I visited the Nenjiang General Station of Aerial Forest Protection of the Ministry of Forestry. Whenever the young pilots and observers returned from patrolling in their silver forest protection aircraft, they would enthusiastically tell me about the situation of aerial forest protection.
    Pilots Wu Zidan and Han Jiaqi described their experience of an aerial patrol: Once, while patrolling over Yichun, the weather was clear and there were no signs of fire anywhere. Just as they were about to turn back, they suddenly noticed several white clouds appearing on the top of a mountain to the left of the flight path. Experience told them that this was a sign of a forest fire! They immediately flew towards the clouds, and the shape of the clouds became more and more distinct. Below was a black cloud of smoke, and the plane circled outside the thick smoke, seeing flames rolling in the dense forest. They immediately dropped fire report communication bombs to nearby villages and sent a telegram to the fire prevention headquarters. The ground firefighters were dispatched... The next day when we flew there for patrol again, we found that the fire had already been extinguished, and the fire had only spread to a very small area.
    Once, we took a forest protection plane from Nenjiang to Heilongjiang, passing through the hinterland of the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area. The forest protection personnel told me: Right here, there was once a major fire that spread for hundreds of miles, mobilized thousands of people, and took more than ten days to extinguish. In this fire-fighting struggle, the plane participated in the command work for the first time. The plane scouted the location, direction, and possible development of the fire every day, so that the headquarters could keep abreast of the fire situation and the headquarters' orders could be transmitted to the front-line fire fighting teams in time. When the fire broke through the Kora River, the county magistrate of Nenjiang County led a cavalry to chase after it. As soon as the fire crossed the river, the direction changed, and the fire spread from northeast to northwest. However, after the cavalry crossed the river, they still groped around in the northeast direction to find the source of the fire. The plane promptly informed the cavalry of this situation, and the cavalry rushed to stop its development. Sometimes the fire was very dangerous, and the thick smoke rose like a tornado in the desert, rising to a height of more than 2,500 meters. Often, a change in the wind direction would engulf people in the flames, causing casualties. The plane often paid attention to guiding them to evacuate in time to ensure the safety of the firefighters.
    The fire fighting teams are very hardworking, and most of the places they pass through are uninhabited and have no roads. In every fire fight, the plane has to transport a large amount of dry food, shoes and other supplies to the fire fighting teams. As soon as the fire fighting teams hear the sound of the plane, they know that they don't have to worry about the supply problem.
    Whenever the spring snow melts and the autumn grass withers, when the sound of aircraft engines rings over the forest, the residents of the villages on the edge of the forest area know that the fire prevention season has arrived. Residents organize themselves to check whether pedestrians are carrying lighters or other flammable materials into the mountains. When there is a strong wind, the village raises a warning flag to cooperate with the plane in forest protection work.
    This aerial forest protection station was established in 1952. In the past few years, it has done a lot of work. Now they are experimenting with chemical agents to extinguish fires, so that planes can directly participate in fire fighting and play a greater role.

    访问航空护林总站
    本报记者　金雨困
    在紧张的护林防火季节里，我访问了林业部嫩江航空护林总站。每当年青的飞行员和观察员们，驾着银色的护林飞机巡逻归来的时候，总是热情地为我介绍航空护林的情形。
    飞行员吴子丹和韩家骐同志介绍了他们一次空中巡逻的经历：有一次，在伊春上空巡逻，天气晴朗，四处皆无火情，他们正打算转回的时候，忽然发现在航线左方的山头上，出现了几朵白云，经验告诉他们，这是森林起火的征候！他们马上向有云的地方飞去，云的形状就越来越分明了，下边是一片黑色的烟雾，飞机在浓烟外盘旋，看到火苗在密林中翻滚着。于是他们立即向附近村屯投下了火报的通讯弹，并向防火指挥部发出了电报。地面上的打火人员出动了……。第二天我们再飞去那里巡逻的时候，发现火场早已熄灭，火只蔓延了很小的一块地方。
    我们有一次坐着护林飞机从嫩江往黑龙江航行，穿过大兴安岭林区的腹部。护林人员告诉我：就在这里，曾经发生过蔓延数百里、动员数千人、经十余天才扑灭的一次大火灾。在这次灭火斗争中，飞机第一次参与了指挥工作。飞机每天侦察火的位置、方向和火势的发展可能，使指挥部能够及时掌握到火情，并使指挥部的命令及时传达到前哨的打火队伍去。当火头突破了科拉河，嫩江县县长带着马队前去追赶时，火一过河方向就变了，火势由向东北转向西北发展。而马队过河后仍向东北方向到处摸索火头，飞机及时把这个情况告诉了马队，马队赶上去制止了它的发展。还有的时候火势很危险，浓烟像沙漠里的龙卷风一样，直升到二千五百多公尺的高空，往往由于风向一倒就把人卷入火舌的包围中，造成伤亡事故。而飞机就经常注意及时指点他们转移出来，来保证打火人员的安全。
    打火队伍是非常艰苦的，所走过的地方大部是没有人烟没有道路的地方。每次打火中，飞机总要为打火队伍输送大量的干粮鞋子等接济品，打火队伍只要一听到飞机声音，就知道供应的问题不用担心了。
    每当春雪融化秋草枯黄，森林上空响起了飞机马达声音时，林区边缘村屯的居民就知道防火季节已经来到。居民就组织起来检查行人有没有带自来火等易燃品入山，遇到刮大风时，村里就升起警旗，配合飞机进行护林工作。
    这个航空护林站是一九五二年建立的，在过去几年中做了许多工作，现在他们正在试验研究采用化学药剂灭火的办法，使飞机能直接参与到灭火工作中去发挥更多的作用。
