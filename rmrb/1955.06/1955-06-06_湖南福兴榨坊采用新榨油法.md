Hunan Fuxing Oil Mill Adopts New Oil Extraction Method

The Xiangtan branch of the Hunan Provincial Oil Company, Fuxing Oil Mill, has adopted a new oil extraction method, which has increased the oil yield of rapeseed oil. This new oil extraction method is the "single-ring, thin-cake, mixed-bran, re-pressing method," which is simple and easy to implement and does not require additional equipment.

The Fuxing Oil Mill has used this new oil extraction method twice, and both times it has achieved good results. The first time, using the new method to extract 132 jin of rapeseed, each 100 jin produced two jin more oil than the old method (double-ring, thick-cake extraction method). The second time, using the new method to extract 126 jin of rapeseed, each 100 jin produced two and a half jin more oil than the old method. After adopting this new method, if re-pressing is carried out, each 100 jin of rapeseed will produce three jin and four liang more oil than the old method. (Our correspondent in Changsha)

    湖南福兴榨坊采用新榨油法
    湖南省油脂公司湘潭分公司福兴榨坊采用新的榨油法，提高了菜油的出油率。这个新的榨油法就是“单圈、薄饼、搀粗糠、翻榨法”，这种榨油法简便易行，不要增加设备。
    福兴榨坊两次试用这种新的榨油法，都收到很好的效果。第一次，用新法榨一百三十二斤菜籽，每百斤比老法（双圈、厚饼的榨法）多榨出二斤油。第二次，用新法榨一百二十六斤菜籽，每百斤比老法多榨出二斤半油。采用这种新法以后，如果再翻榨，每百斤菜籽要比老法多榨出三斤四两油。                   （本报驻长沙记者）
