Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania have recently uncovered and sentenced a number of special agents sent by spy organizations from the United States, Britain, and West Germany to these countries.

Poland has recently uncovered several espionage cases in succession. The Warsaw Garrison Military Court sentenced F. Dubelyak and A. Borichka, special agents sent to Poland by American and British spy agencies, to death in early June and late May, respectively. The Szczecin Military Court sentenced Grishinsky and three others, spies from the center of an American spy organization, to prison terms in late May. According to the interrogation, Dubelyak was originally a Polish criminal who fled to West Berlin in 1949 and established contact with the spy centers of the United States, Britain, and West Germany, helping them dispatch special agents and saboteurs to Poland in order to organize spy networks, carry out sabotage, and engage in espionage activities. Borichka was a member of a spy organization serving American and British spy agencies, belonging to the so-called Free and Independent Corps organized in various Western European countries after the war. He carried out sabotage activities against People's Poland. A pistol, poison, and forged documents were found on his person.

During the recent period, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Interior organs uncovered and arrested thirteen American special agents who had infiltrated the country, as well as a group of spies working for American spy agencies. After investigation and the confessions of those arrested, they had collected intelligence on the Czechoslovak armed forces and national economy for American spy agencies, taken photographs of the most important industrial buildings, military targets, and transportation hubs, etc. These arrestees had been trained in specialized spy training classes led by American instructors. The interrogation work is still ongoing.

In Romania, two American-parachuted special agents, G. Georgiou and G. Cristescu, recently surrendered to the state security organs, and handed over weapons, radio transceivers, codes, ciphers, and all their American-made equipment to the state security organs. These two special agents were recruited by American intelligence agencies abroad to carry out espionage work among Romanian expatriates. Later, they were trained in two special agent schools in France, and one night, on the orders of American spy agencies, they were parachuted by an American plane into the territory of the Romanian People's Republic to engage in special agent activities. Considering the honesty of their confessions, the Romanian Ministry of Interior has granted them the right to reside freely and the opportunity to participate in labor.

    波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚
    接连破获并判处美英间谍组织的特务分子
    新华社十七日讯　波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚在最近一个时期破获并判处了一些从美国、英国和西德的间谍组织派到这些国家来的特务分子。
    波兰最近连续破获了好几起间谍案。华沙卫戍军事法庭在六月初和五月下旬分别判处美英间谍机关派到波兰的特务弗·杜贝利亚克和阿·博里奇卡以死刑。斯才新军事法庭在五月下旬对美国间谍组织中心的间谍格里辛斯基等四人，判处了徒刑。据审讯证明，杜贝利亚克原是波兰刑事犯，一九四九年逃到西柏林后与美国、英国和西德的间谍中心建立了联系，帮助它们把特务和破坏分子派遣到波兰，以便组织间谍网、进行破坏活动和谍报活动。博里奇卡是为美国和英国间谍机关服务的间谍组织的人员，他属于战后在西欧各国中组织的所谓自由独立团。他对人民波兰进行破坏活动。在他身上搜出了手枪、毒药和伪造文件等。
    捷克斯洛伐克内务部机关最近期间破获并逮捕了潜入国境的十三名美国特务及一批替美国间谍机关工作的间谍分子，经过侦查和被捕者的供认，他们曾替美国间谍机关收集关于捷克斯洛伐克武装部队和国民经济方面的情报，摄制最重要的工业建筑和军事目标以及交通枢纽的照片等等。这些被捕者在美国教官所领导的专门训练间谍的训练班中受过训练。审讯工作还在继续进行。
    在罗马尼亚，最近有两个美国空投特务格·格奥尔吉乌和格·克里斯特斯库向国家保安机关自首，并向国家保安机关缴出了武器、无线电收发报机、密码、暗号以及他们所有的美国制的装备品。这两个特务在国外时曾被美国情报机关招募去在罗马尼亚侨民中进行间谍工作。后来，他们在法国境内的两所特务学校受训，于一天晚上奉美国间谍机关命令被美国飞机空投在罗马尼亚人民共和国境内，从事特务活动。罗马尼亚内务部考虑到他们两人供词的诚实，已给予他们自由居住的权利和参加劳动的机会。
