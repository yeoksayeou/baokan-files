    Today, a huge banner with the words "Welcome Indian Cultural Delegation" was hung on the platform of Dalian Railway Station, and countless colorful flags fluttered in the wind. As the train carrying the distinguished guests slowly entered the station, the welcoming crowd on the platform applauded warmly, waving bouquets to greet the guests.

    After the distinguished guests stepped out of the carriages, the welcoming people surged forward to present flowers to the delegation members. Delegation head Chand and his wife accepted large bouquets of flowers presented by two Young Pioneers wearing red scarves, and they shook hands with the welcomers. Subsequently, Fang Bing, Director of the Lüda Municipal People's Committee Cultural Bureau, accompanied the distinguished guests to their residence for rest. Before getting into the cars to leave the station, the delegation members waved to the welcoming crowd all the way, enthusiastically shouting "Friendship! Friendship!" in Chinese.

    After a short rest, the distinguished guests visited the Xigang District to learn about handicraft production. Delegation head Chand and his wife inquired in detail about the workers' production and living conditions during the visit.

    At 3:00 PM, the entire delegation visited the Lüda natural bathing beach - Fujiazhuang Beach, where they were warmly welcomed by local fishermen and workers recuperating in the sanatorium there. When the vast expanse of the sea was displayed before the artists' eyes, they couldn't help but cheer. Dancer Indrani Rahman was the first to take off her shoes with great enthusiasm, stepping over the pebbles on the beach, singing lyrics in a low voice as she walked towards the deep blue sea. Many people jumped into the sea to swim, many people floated on the sea in boats, and some were fishing there. Many people on the shore sang songs of Sino-Indian friendship. Dancer K. Kuti also excitedly performed his clever and varied gestures and diverse dance postures. Dancer Indrani Rahman also took a group photo on this beautiful and moving seaside with a group of miners and PLA soldiers recuperating at the seaside, with the blue sky and green peaks and a distant view of a sanatorium as the background.
