Heartfelt Joy
Liu Baiyu, Director of the Chinese Writers Association

The Indian cultural delegation brought us very beautiful and moving music and dance, which aroused a warm welcome from our Chinese audience. Indian art is so rich in color, like spring flowers, as bright and dazzling as the stars on a summer night. When it unfolds before you, it immediately attracts you.

When we think about it, the sound of the sitar is so loud and melodious that it surprises and delights you. I really admire Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan, this outstanding artist. When he plays, he not only immerses himself deeply in the beautiful music, but also guides everyone in the entire venue to blend into his beautiful musical melody. From the strings of his sitar, a true voice of the heart is emitted. Indrani Rahman's dance is so simple and beautiful, and some of the most beautiful movements can be said to be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and unforgettable forever. Also, in the "Holi Dance", the dance of the shepherd god in the distant sound of the shepherd's horn at dawn, so serene, and when the shepherd god splashes colored water on his lover Radha, the dance is so pleasant and joyful. Indian art is implicit and profound; at the same time, it is also rich and varied. It often suddenly reveals the heroic mood of the Indian people. On the night I went to see the cultural delegation's performance, the "Handkerchief Dance" was greeted with enthusiastic cheers from the audience for its amazing brilliance and agility; Debabrata Biswas's "Tagore's Ode" sang the enthusiasm and longing for freedom of the entire Indian nation. All of these are gifts brought to us by outstanding Indian artists, and at the same time, they are also the profound friendship they bring to us.

As a Chinese cultural worker, I have visited India. I personally saw this great, solemn and beautiful country. Now, every time I see Indian dance, or hear Indian songs, sitar music, or drum sounds, I immediately think of the entire beautiful country that I love. People describe ancient India as a land of gold and honey. We say that today's India is full of the people's enthusiasm for maintaining peace and justice. I remember being warmly received by Prime Minister Nehru in Delhi. I remember the journey from Delhi to Mumbai, then through the Deccan Plateau to Madras, to Cape Comorin at the southernmost tip, and the sincere welcome I received from the Indian people along the way. I remember that our companions said at the time: "Connecting the garlands given to us by Indian friends can simply cover the roads we have traveled in India." We cannot forget India. When you face this country full of flowers, face the lights in Mumbai Bay that are arranged like pearls, face the dawn of Cape Comorin, face the white Taj Mahal mausoleum, the ancient Ajanta excavated from the sandy plains, such amazing artistic creations, you cannot help but admire the Indian people who created these creations, how excellent the people are, with such profound creativity and such great魄力. And now, the music and dance presented before us are exactly what this country and its people have enriched through years of creation. We believe that it will inevitably leave an indelible impression in the hearts of our audience. And this impression is growing and strengthening the friendship between China and India. After watching the performances of the Indian artists, I could not restrain myself from writing down my thoughts and my heartfelt joy. I would like to end with a few lines of poetry sung by a young Indian poet at a night party in Agra, India. He sang:

"The friendship between India and China,
Will be as strong as the Himalayas;
In the hearts of the people of both countries,
Love will flow forever like the Ganges."

Yes, from the Yellow River to the Ganges, it is far away, but also very close. Let our free torrent flow forever in our hearts.

### 衷心的喜悦

    衷心的喜悦
    中国作家协会理事　刘白羽
    印度文化代表团给我们带来非常优美的，非常动人的音乐和舞蹈，这引起了我们中国观众热烈的欢迎。印度的艺术，色彩是如此的丰富，像春天的鲜花一样，像夏夜的繁星一样灿烂夺目，当它在你面前展开的时候，它立刻就把你吸引着了。
    我们想一想，那锡达尔的声音，是多么嘹亮，而又多么委婉，它使你惊讶，也使你喜悦。我真羡慕阿卜杜勒·哈利姆·贾法尔·康恩，这一位出色的艺术家，当他演奏时，他不但自己完全深入地和那美妙的音乐相融合，同时也引导着整个会场上的人，一下子都融合在他的美妙的音乐旋律中了，在他的锡达尔的琴弦上，发出了真正的心声。印德拉尼·拉赫曼的舞姿，是那样单纯、优美、其中若干最优美的动作，可以说是深入人心，永远难忘的。还有“洒红节之舞”中，黎明，悠远的牧角声中，牧神的那一段舞蹈，那样宁静，而当牧神把彩色的水，向他的恋人拉达身上泼洒时，那舞蹈，那样愉快，欢乐。印度的艺术，是含蓄的，深刻的；同时，也是丰富的，变化的，它常常把印度人民豪迈的心情，突然展现出来。在我去看文化代表团表演的那晚上，“手帕舞”以它惊人的光彩、矫捷，受到观众十分热烈的欢呼；德巴布拉塔·毕斯瓦斯的“泰戈尔的颂歌”，唱出整个印度民族的热情和向往自由的精神。这一切，都是优秀的印度艺术家们带来给我们的礼物，同时，也是他们带来给我们的深厚的情谊。
    作为一个中国的文化工作者，我访问过印度。我亲自看到这个伟大、庄严而又美丽的国家。现在，当我每一次看到印度的舞蹈，或者听到印度的歌声、琴声、鼓声的时候，我立刻想起我所爱的那整个美丽的国家来了。人们形容古代的印度，是遍地黄金和蜂蜜的国土，我们说今天的印度，充满着人民维护和平和正义的热情。我记得在德里，受到尼赫鲁总理的亲切的招待。我记得从德里到孟买，而后经德干高原，到马德拉斯，到最南端的哥摩林海角的路程，以及沿途受到印度人民诚挚的欢迎。我记得，当时我们的同伴曾说过：“把印度朋友给我们的花环连接起来，简直可以铺遍我们在印度走过的路程。”我们无法忘记印度。当你面对着这个满地是鲜花的国家，面对着孟买海湾那像珍珠一样排列的灯火，面对着哥摩林海角的黎明，面对着白色的大吉玛哈陵寝，从沙原上发掘出来的、古老的阿旃陀，那样惊美的艺术创作品时，你不能不羡慕创造出这种创作品的印度人民，是多么优秀的人民，有着多么深刻的创造性，多么巨大的魄力。而现在，在我们眼前展现出来的音乐和舞蹈，就正是这个国家、人民，经过多年创造而丰富起来的。我们相信，它，将必然地在我们观众心中，留下永不磨灭的印象。而这种印象，正生长着、茁壮着我们中国和印度之间的情谊。在看了印度艺术家们的演出之后，我不可抑制地写出我的感想，写下我的衷心的喜悦。我想用在印度亚格拉一次夜会上，一位印度青年诗人，唱出的几句诗作为结束，他唱：
    “印度和中国的友谊，
    将像喜马拉雅山一样的坚牢；
    在两国人民的心中，
    爱会如同恒河一样永远地奔流。”
    是的，从黄河到恒河，遥远，但也很近，让我们的自由的激流，在我们心中永远奔流吧。
