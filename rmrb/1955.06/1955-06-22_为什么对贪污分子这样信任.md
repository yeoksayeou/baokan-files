Why such trust in embezzlers
Lian Yunshan

Not long ago, the People's Procuratorate of Urumqi City, Xinjiang Province, investigated and found a recidivist embezzler from the Urumqi City Trading Company named Qiu Guifu. During the "Three-Anti" movement, he was sentenced to two years in prison for embezzling more than 1,100 yuan of state funds, later changed to supervision by the organization. During his supervision, Qiu Guifu did not thoroughly recognize his own shameful ideology. The leading personnel of the Urumqi City Trading Company were aware of these circumstances. However, before Qiu Guifu's supervision was lifted, the company put this embezzler and thief back in charge of state finances. Not only that, but Qiu Guifu was also made both accountant and cashier. The reason was that this thief was "familiar with the business" and "had a knack for the work." After being rehired, the company trusted Qiu Guifu very much and never made a serious inspection of his work. As a result, in less than half a year, the state's property was smoothly stolen by this shameless thief for more than 5,000 yuan.

After the public security and procuratorial organs solved this embezzlement case, Qiu Guifu has been sentenced according to law.

In April, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau solved the embezzlement case of Xu Puzhen, a staff member of the Savings Department of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China. Xu Puzhen had been given a warning during the "Three-Anti" movement for embezzlement; but after the "Three-Anti" movement, the Shanghai Branch Savings Department still completely trusted him, so that in less than a year, this thief began to steal again. When he saw that no one was checking his work and he became bolder and bolder in his theft, and lived a corrupt life, his leaders thought he was "capable and very active" and promoted him to deputy leader of the bill group. In this way, he successfully stole more than 7,500 yuan of state property. Even when the public security organs had already grasped the conclusive evidence of Xu Puzhen's embezzlement, the leaders of the Shanghai Branch Savings Department still suspected that the Public Security Bureau was "wronging" a good person, saying: "Would Xu Puzhen do such a thing?"

Faced with these painful and infuriating facts, any citizen of New China has the right to ask the Urumqi City Trading Company and the Shanghai Branch Savings Department of the People's Bank of China: Why do you unconditionally trust those thieves who have shamelessly embezzled and stolen state property? Does your organization have a system for employing people? Do you have principles? What are your systems and principles for employing people?

Everyone understands that the staff of New China's state organs must be honest and devoted to public service. This is a basic condition; those who do not meet this condition cannot serve as staff of state organs, let alone hold positions directly in charge of state funds. Embezzlers who have been discovered and sanctioned during the "Three-Anti" movement, even if some of them have not embezzled many times or large sums of money and have been treated "leniently," still have problems with their character, and the Party and state organs must thoroughly reform these people. It is good that they have examined their mistakes and expressed their determination to correct them. However, if they are to be put in charge of managing money, they must be tested in practice, and their promises and temporary "performance" cannot be easily believed. Specifically, this means: first, they must absolutely not be given responsible work quickly; second, their work must be closely checked at all times; third, the masses must be organized to supervise them in all aspects, including their life and style. Without these measures, it is difficult to guarantee that these people will not take advantage of opportunities to do evil again.

However, the Urumqi City Trading Company and the Shanghai Branch Savings Department of the People's Bank of China have not done this at all. One person serving as both accountant and cashier is not allowed for general staff under normal circumstances; but the embezzler Qiu Guifu has obtained this extraordinary trust and entrustment. What basis does this company have to trust Qiu Guifu so extraordinarily? The Shanghai Branch Savings Department arbitrarily promoted the embezzler Xu Puzhen, and even after the Public Security Bureau had obtained conclusive evidence of Xu Puzhen's re-embezzlement, they still did not believe that Xu Puzhen would embezzle. What is the basis for this unlimited trust? Based on their work ability? This is difficult to explain, because everyone knows that having ability does not mean that one will not embezzle. Some people think this way when using these bad guys: they have already been sanctioned and punished, and they probably won't embezzle again! But why not think the other way around: What if they still dare to embezzle? Precisely because they didn't think this way, they took state property to "gamble," blindly handing over state property to former thieves to manage. In the minds of some other people, there is actually another perhaps less clear idea, which is that it doesn't matter if some thieves embezzle some state property, as long as they can do things for "me" or "our" small unit. Whatever their thoughts, we demand a thorough investigation of these types of incidents: thieves should certainly be punished, and those leaders who intentionally or unintentionally created various convenient conditions and environments for the thieves must also be severely condemned and even punished.

Recently, the Tianjin Higher People's Court made a statistic: In the embezzlement cases accepted by the court in 1954, more than 50 percent of the embezzlers had embezzled before the "Three-Anti" movement and then re-engaged in embezzlement after the "Three-Anti" movement. There are also some similar statistics in other regions. It can be seen that this situation is not isolated. We demand that the supervisory organs at all levels, and even the Party and government leading organs, pay close attention to this intolerable problem, and take effective measures to expose and eliminate this intolerable phenomenon.

    为什么对贪污分子这样信任
    连云山
    不久以前，新疆省乌鲁木齐市人民检察院从乌鲁木齐市贸易公司里检察出一个“三反”后重犯贪污罪行的分子，名字叫邱桂馥。他在“三反”运动中，就曾经因为贪污了国家一千一百多元而被判处两年徒刑，以后改为机关管制。在管制期间，邱桂馥对他自己的可耻的思想意识并没有彻底地认识。这些情况，乌鲁木齐市贸易公司的领导人员都知道。但是，在邱桂馥的管制还没有撤销的时候，这个公司就又把这个贪污盗窃分子重新放到掌管国家财务的岗位上了。不仅如此，而且还让邱桂馥身兼会计和出纳两职。理由是这个盗贼“业务熟悉”，“工作上有一套”。重新起用以后，这个公司对邱桂馥非常信任，对他的工作一直没有作过认真的检查。这样，不到半年，国家的财产就又被这个无耻的盗贼顺利地盗去了五千多元。
    这件贪污案经公安、检察机关破获以后，邱桂馥已被依法判刑了。
    四月间，上海市公安机关破获了中国人民银行上海分行储蓄部工作人员徐浦珍的贪污案。徐浦珍在“三反”运动中曾经因为贪污受过警告处分；但在“三反”以后，上海分行储蓄部对他仍然完全信任，以致不到一年，这个盗贼就又重新开始盗窃。当他看见没有人检查他的工作而越盗越胆大，并且过着腐烂生活的时候，他的领导人却认为他“能力不错，也很积极”，把他提拔为票据组的副组长了。这样，他先后得心应手地盗窃了国家财产七千五百多元。甚至当公安机关已经掌握了徐浦珍贪污的确凿证据以后，上海分行储蓄部的领导人还在怀疑公安局“冤枉”好人，说：“徐浦珍会干这种事吗？”
    面对着这些令人痛心和令人愤怒的事实，任何
  一个新中国的公民都有权利向乌鲁木齐市贸易公司和中国人民银行上海分行储蓄部发问：你们为什么对那些曾经无耻地贪污盗窃过国家财产的盗贼那么无条件地信任？你们机关用人有没有制度？有没有原则？你们用人的制度和原则是什么？
    谁都懂得：新中国的国家机关工作人员必须是廉洁奉公的。这是一个起码的条件，不具备这个条件的就不能充当国家机关工作人员，更不能担任直接掌管国家钱财的工作。“三反”期间已经发现、并且受过制裁的贪污分子，即使有些人贪污的次数和钱财数目不多，被“从宽”处理过了，但这些人的品质是有问题的，党和国家机关对这些人必须进行彻底地改造。他们检讨了错误，表示了改正的决心，这是好的。但是，如果让他们担任管理钱财的工作，则必须经过实际的考验，而不能轻易地相信他们的诺言和一时的“表现”。具体说，就是：第一、绝对不能很快就给他们以负责的工作；第二、必须随时随地严密检查他们的工作；第三、组织群众对他们实行各方面的监督，包括生活和作风的监督。没有这些措施，就很难保证这些人不再乘隙作恶。
    但是，乌鲁木齐市贸易公司和中国人民银行上海分行储蓄部却完全没有这样做。一人兼任会计和出纳两职，在正常状况下，对一般工作人员都是不允许的；但贪污分子邱桂馥却取得了这种超乎一般的特别信任和委托。这个公司有什么根据可以这样超乎一般地信任邱桂馥呢？上海分行储蓄部随意提升贪污分子徐浦珍的职位，而且在公安局已经得到徐浦珍重新贪污的确凿证据之后，还不相信徐浦珍会贪污，这种无限度的信任又是根据什么？根据他们的工作能力吗？这是很难解释通的，因为谁都知道：有能力不等于不会贪污。有的人在使用这些坏家伙时这样想：他们已经受过制裁，受过处分，大概不会再贪污了吧！但是不反过来想想：如果他们还敢贪污呢？正因为没有这样想，所以他们就拿国家财产来“打赌”，闭着眼睛把国家财产交给不久以前的盗贼去管。在另一些人的脑子里，实际上还有另外一个也许是不太明确的想法，就是认为让一些盗贼贪污盗窃一些国家的财产不要紧，只要他们能给“我”或“我们”这个小单位办事就行了。不管他们的想法是什么，我们要求彻底检查这类事件：盗贼固然应该受到惩罚，那些有意无意地给盗贼们创造了各种便利条件和环境的领导人，也必须受到严厉的谴责以至处分。
    最近天津市高级人民法院作了一个统计：在一九五四年该院受理的贪污案件中，有百分之五十以上的贪污犯是在“三反”以前就贪污过而在“三反”以后又重新发生贪污行为的。其他地区也有一些类似的统计。可见这种情况并不是个别的。我们要求各地监察机关以至党政领导机关切实注意能容忍这一问题，并采取有效的措施来揭发和消除这类不能容忍的现象。
