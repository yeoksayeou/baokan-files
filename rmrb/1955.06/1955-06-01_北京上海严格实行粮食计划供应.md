Xinhua News Agency, May 31st: The Beijing Municipal People's Committee approved the Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau's "Provisional Measures for Planned Grain Supply to Government Organs, Organizations, Schools, Hospitals, Factories, and Enterprises" and notified all units to implement a strict grain budgeting system from June 1st. It requires each unit to compile a grain demand plan at the beginning of each month, based on the actual number of people eating in the mess hall. This plan must be verified and signed by the head of the unit and submitted to the local district People's Committee for verification and issuance of a grain purchase certificate. No grain will be purchased without a submitted demand plan and a certificate. At the end of each month, each unit must check the implementation of the plan, calculate and statistically record the actual number of people eating, the amount of grain purchased, consumed, remaining, and saved, and submit the grain demand plan for the following month. For temporary grain needs, such as for meetings, additional grain can be requested based on actual needs. Grain management departments must conduct regular inspections of grain usage in each unit. Each unit must assign a specific person to be responsible for studying methods of saving grain and overcoming waste, and for checking the implementation of the unit's plan. Furthermore, they must strengthen education on grain conservation for employees, cadres, mess hall managers, and cooks. The measures also stipulate that anyone who violates the provisions of the provisional measures for grain supply will be subject to disciplinary action as appropriate.
    The Beijing Municipal People's Committee has decided to establish grain sections in each district People's Committee, specifically responsible for managing the planned grain supply for government organs, organizations, hospitals, schools, factories, enterprises, and citizens in their respective districts.
    Xinhua News Agency: Shanghai has begun to rectify its planned grain supply work.
    On May 16th, the Municipal People's Committee held a meeting and approved the "Provisional Measures for Planned Grain Supply by Household in Shanghai." The implementation of these measures is to ensure a rational grain supply in the city, eliminate grain speculation, and conserve grain usage. From May 21st, work teams in each district began conducting publicity and education work among the city's residents. Many residents have now established monthly grain purchase plans, and more than 1.3 million new grain purchase certificates have been issued to urban residents. Residents have begun purchasing grain from designated grain supply stores according to their plans. At the same time, grain-deficient farmers in the suburbs have also established grain purchase plans and obtained grain purchase certificates.
    All industries in the city that use grain as a raw material have also formulated monthly grain usage plans based on their actual needs. Recently, relevant departments jointly formed a grain conservation group to study and supervise the rational conservation of grain in industrial production.
    Prior to this, nearly 10,000 mess hall units in factories, schools, government organs, and organizations throughout the city had already prepared grain purchase plans at the beginning of May.

    新华社讯　上海市开始整顿粮食计划供应工作。
    五月十六日，市人民委员会开会讨论通过了
  “上海市粮食按户计划供应暂行办法”。实行这个办法是为了保证本市粮食合理供应，取缔粮食投机并节约用粮。从五月二十一日开始，各区的工作队向全市居民进行宣传教育工作。现在许多居民已订出了月份购粮计划，一百三十多万份新购粮证已发到市区居民手中，居民开始向指定的粮食供应店按计划购粮。同时，郊区的缺粮农民也已订出购粮计划并领得了购粮证。
    全市以粮食为原料的行业也根据实际需要编制了每月用粮计划。最近，各有关部门联合组成了一个节约用粮小组，研究和督促在工业生产中合理地节约用粮。
    在此以前，全市工厂、学校、机关、团体等将近一万个伙食单位，已于五月初首先编制了购粮计划。
