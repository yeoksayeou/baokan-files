    The Big Salt Lake in the Desert
    By Our Reporter Kang Weizhong
    From Lanzhou, take a train to Wuwei, then a bus 250 kilometers north to the foot of the Yabrai Mountains, where you will see a large, glaringly white depression. At the eastern end of the depression stand rows of new-style bungalows. This is the location of the Yabrai Natural Salt Lake, the richest in Northwest China—the state-owned Yabrai Saltworks.
    The area and output of this salt lake had never been accurately surveyed before. In 1954, the Northwest Salt Affairs Bureau conducted a preliminary survey and discovered that the total area of the lake is approximately 90 square li, of which the proven salt-bearing area is 40 square li, with an estimated reserve of about 400 million dan (one dan equals 100 jin). In the current extraction area, the salt layer is covered with a 15-centimeter-thick brine crust. Below the crust is a salt layer about two meters thick, as hard as rock. When the salt workers extract the salt, they first use pickaxes and iron spades to uncover the brine crust, then use iron drills to break up the salt layer, from which brine seeps out. They then use leaky iron ladles to scoop out the salt. The characteristic of Yabrai salt is that it regenerates continuously after extraction. Generally, within 20 years after extraction, it will be filled with new salt after wind and sun exposure. Therefore, it is an inexhaustible treasure of the motherland. The quality of the salt is also very pure, containing 97 to 98 percent sodium chloride, and the production cost is low, making it popular among the people.
    During the years of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang, the production of Yabrai salt was monopolized by several contractor bosses. In order to pursue high profits, they drove the workers to dig and extract salt indiscriminately, destroying the salt lake into a honeycomb-like surface, seriously reducing its utilization rate. They cruelly exploited the salt workers. Many salt workers could not get enough to eat or wear, and were constantly threatened with dismissal. "Eating like piglets, working like oxen, sleeping like stray dogs, and earning only two or three dou of wages a month" is how the salt workers described their lives.
    After liberation, the People's Government took over the salt lake, abolished the contracting system, and gradually implemented a method of planned salt extraction by zones. This not only protected the salt fields but also gradually improved the working and living conditions of the salt workers. In 1953, more than 1,400 square meters of new-style bungalows and a relatively well-equipped clinic were built. Workers now wear long rubber boots when they go down to the lake to extract salt, unlike in the past when they were barefoot. The output of the salt lake has been increasing year by year. The output of salt in 1952 nearly doubled compared to 1951. Especially during the production season from April to November 1954, all the staff and workers of the saltworks enthusiastically launched a labor competition. Salt workers Yuan Zongguo, Wang Suoshi, and others put forward rationalization proposals for improving the "bai xi" (a tool used for sifting salt in water), which was immediately promoted and used by all the salt workers in the saltworks, increasing output by 15 percent. The first production team of the third production group increased production from 55 dan per person per day to more than 101 dan. As a result, the annual production plan for 1954 was overfulfilled. In order to meet the growing needs of the people, the planned total output of the saltworks this year will be four times higher than the actual output last year; the number of employees has also increased accordingly from 100 to more than 400. Now that the production season has arrived, the saltworks is launching an increase-production movement of "masters teaching apprentices" to improve the salt extraction skills of the new salt workers.
    After the completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway from Lanzhou to Wuwei, it greatly facilitated the transportation of Yabrai salt. After the highway from Wuwei to the salt lake was opened in November last year, a large number of trucks, fully loaded with Yabrai salt, were transported and sold to all parts of the province. In addition, tens of thousands of camels helped with the transportation, enabling consumers to quickly get high-quality and low-priced Yabrai salt.
    This year, the state-owned Yabrai Saltworks plans to expand the housing area by 2,100 square meters; in order to prevent sandstorms, trees will be planted on a 6,000-meter-long strip of land; and one of the two pressure water wells to solve the drinking water problem for the entire saltworks has already been completed. After these constructions are completed, the working and living conditions of the staff and workers will be further improved.

    沙漠中的大盐池
    本报记者　康伟中
    从兰州乘火车到武威，然后改乘汽车北行二百五十公里，就看到雅布赖山脚下有一大片白得刺眼的洼地，洼地东头立着一排排新式平房，这就是西北最丰富的雅布赖天然盐池——国营雅布赖盐场所在地。
    这个盐池的面积和产量，以前从未进行过精确的勘查。一九五四年，西北盐务管理局作了初步勘查，才知道全池面积在九十平方里左右，其中已探出的藏盐面积有四十平方里，估计藏量有四亿万担左右（一担为一百斤）。在目前的捞产区，盐层上面结有十五公分厚的卤盖，在卤盖下面，就是厚有两公尺左右、坚如石块的食盐了。盐工们在捞盐时，先用镢头、铁铣将卤盖揭开，用铁钻钻碎盐层，里面渗透出卤水，再用漏水的铁杓把盐掏出。雅盐的特点是能循环不息地随掏随生。一般在掏后二十年内，经过风吹日晒，就可生满新盐，因之它是祖国取之不尽用之不竭的宝藏。盐的质量也很纯洁，含氯化钠百分之九十七至九十八，且产制成本低，一向为人民所喜爱。
    在国民党反动统治的年代里，雅盐生产被几家包工头子独占，他们为了追逐高额利润，驱使工人乱挖乱捞，把盐池破坏成蜂窝麻面，严重地降低了它的使用率。他们对盐工进行了残酷剥削。许多盐工吃不饱穿不暖，经常遭受解雇的威胁。“吃饭像猪娃，作活如牛马，夜宿似野狗，一月工资只得二三斗。”这就是盐工们对自己生活的描写。
    解放后，人民政府接管了这个盐池，取缔了包工制度，逐步实行了分片计划捞盐的办法；不仅保护了盐田，而且也逐步改善了盐工的工作条件和生活条件。一九五三年兴建了一千四百多平方公尺新式平房和一所比较完善的诊疗所。工人下池捞盐，全都穿着长统胶靴，再不像过去那样赤手光足了。盐池的产量年年增加。一九五二年盐的产量比一九五一年增加将近两倍。特别在一九五四年四月到十一月的生产季节中，盐场全体职工轰轰烈烈地开展了劳动竞赛。捞盐工人袁宗国、王所恃等提出了改进摆铣（在水里摆盐用的工具）的合理化建议，当即为全场盐工推广使用，使产量提高百分之十五。第三生产小组的第一个生产班，由每人每天生产五十五担，提高到一百零一担多。因而使一九五四年全年生产计划超额完成了。为了满足人民日益增长的需要，今年全场的计划总产量要比去年实际产量增加四倍；职工人数也相应地由一百人增加到四百多人。现在生产季节已到，为了提高新盐工的捞盐技术，全场正开展“师傅带徒弟”的增产运动。
    兰新铁路由兰州通往武威后，大大便利了雅盐外运。去年十一月从武威到盐池的公路修通后，数量众多的汽车满载着大批雅盐运销全省各地。加上上万头骆驼协助运送，使广大消费者能迅速吃到物美价廉的雅盐了。
    今年，国营雅布赖盐场计划扩建二千一百平方公尺的住宅；为防范沙患，将在六千公尺长的地带试种树木；解决全场吃水问题的两口压水机井，有一口已经打好。这些建设完成之后，职工的工作条件和生活条件将得到进一步的改善。
