Correcting the Phenomenon of Land Waste
Shaanxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs

The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs inspected the land requisition by basic construction units in Xianyang, Baoji, Lintong, and other counties and found that the phenomenon of land waste was very serious. Twenty-four units, including the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and Northwest Institute of Technology, requisitioned more than 1,280 mu of land from 1951 to August 1954 that was not used. According to the land-use units, some were preparing for construction, while others did not plan to build in the next few years. For example, the former Northwest Textile Workers' Union Sanatorium (now under the leadership of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions) purchased 104 mu of land near Huaqing Pool in Lintong in May 1953, but has not yet started construction. Of these more than 1,000 mu of land, more than 950 mu were private land, costing a total investment of more than 150,000 yuan.

Of these more than 1,000 mu of requisitioned but unused land, 205 mu were wasteland. Calculated at an annual grain yield of 350 jin per mu, the annual grain production was reduced by more than 71,700 jin. Some of the land was given to cadres' families or the masses for free cultivation or rented by the masses, and some was cultivated by the institutions themselves. However, due to short-term cultivation, they were not well managed, and there were varying degrees of reduced production, with more severe reductions in areas cultivated by family members.

Some land-use units built houses that were too scattered, thus wasting land. For example, the No. 6 Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways requisitioned more than 163 mu of land for the construction of schools, cultural palaces, bathhouses, canteens, supply stores, and hospitals, with a building area of only more than 11.8 mu, and vacant land accounting for more than 92 percent. Some units also issued compensation fees for land requisitioned that already had seedlings growing on it, even though construction would not begin immediately, and all the seedlings were removed, which wasted investment and reduced grain production. After our research with relevant units, the above requisitioned but unused land has been basically dealt with. In addition to the land that has been started for construction or allocated to other units, the remaining land that will not be built on for more than three months will be taken back by the local county (city) people's committee and handed over to the masses for cultivation (to be taken back free of charge when the state needs it).

The emergence of the above problems is, of course, related to the lack of experience and the objective difficulties in design and construction, but the main reasons are that land-use units do not pay attention to saving land, the project design is inaccurate, there is no precise plan, and the leadership is bureaucratic and does not conduct detailed reviews, resulting in land waste. For example, the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory requisitioned 1,108 mu of land in Xianyang City in 1951, but only used 717 mu. Some land-use units requisitioned too much land simply for the purpose of occupying land and using the construction funds allocated by higher authorities. For example, the Baoji Timber Branch Company planned to build more than 30 houses, which only required 5 mu of land, but the higher authorities allocated a lot of construction funds, so in order to spend all the money, it requisitioned 49 mu of land. The civil affairs departments at all levels did not strictly implement the approval system for land requisition by construction units, and only relied on the plans submitted by the land-use units during the approval process, and did not conduct serious inspections after requisition.

In order to rationally handle the land requisitioned but unused by various units in the future and prevent the continued occurrence of waste and barrenness, we suggest:

1.  All land for which the land-use unit has no construction plan or does not intend to build should be taken back by the local county (city) people's committee and handed over to the landless or land-poor masses for cultivation, and appropriate rent should be charged as local fiscal revenue. However, it must be explained to the farmers that when the state needs it, it will be taken back free of charge. If the seedlings planted by the masses must be removed due to urgent construction, the construction unit shall be responsible for compensation. This land can also be allocated to other units for use free of charge, but the original land-use unit should be contacted in advance, and if the original land-use unit submits reliable data proving that it is indeed needed, it should be retained. For unused land that has been enclosed by walls, the local people's committee should study with the land-use unit and hand it over to the masses for cultivation without affecting the security work.

2.  Land-use units should make careful plans based on actual needs and the principle of saving land, and truly requisition as much as needed. The civil affairs departments at all levels should also earnestly implement the approval system, strictly review it, and strictly prohibit the behavior of removing seedlings without construction.

3.  The special commissioner's offices and county people's committees at all levels should conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the land that has been requisitioned within their jurisdictions. If any barrenness or waste of land is found, it should be handled according to the above opinions.

    纠正浪费土地的现象
    陕西省民政厅
    陕西省民政厅曾在咸阳、宝鸡和临潼等县检查了基本建设单位征用土地的情况，发现浪费土地的现象很严重。国营西北第一棉纺织厂和西北工学院等二十四个单位，自一九五一年至一九五四年八月，征而未用的土地达一千二百八十多亩。据用地单位谈：有的准备修建，有的在几年内却不打算修建。如前西北纺织工会疗养院（现归陕西省总工会领导）一九五三年五月在临潼华清池附近购买了土地一百零四亩，至今没有修建。在这一千多亩土地中，征用的私人土地有九百五十多亩，共花了十五万多元的投资。
    在这一千多亩征而未用的土地中，荒芜了的土地有二百零五亩，按每亩年产粮食三百五十斤计算，每年少产粮食七万一千七百多斤。还有一部分土地是交给干部家属或群众无价耕种或由群众租种，也有些是由机关自种的。但是由于是短时期耕种，都没有很好地经营，都有程度不同的减产，其中由眷属耕种的减产更为严重。
    也有些用地单位建筑的房子过于分散，因而浪费了土地。如铁道部第六工程局修建的学校、文化宫、浴室、食堂、供应商店、医院等，共征用土地一百六十三亩多，建筑面积只有十一亩八分多，空地达百分之九十二以上。还有的单位征用的土地上已长出青苗，虽不马上施工，也发了补偿费，把青苗全部铲除了，既浪费了投资，又减产了粮食。以上征而未用的土地，经我们同有关单位研究，基本上得到处理。除已开始修建或调拨给其他单位使用的土地外，其余土地只要在三个月以上暂不修建的，由当地县（市）人民委员会收回，交给群众耕种（国家需要时，无偿收回）。
    以上问题的产生，固然同缺乏经验，设计和施工存在客观困难有关，但主要原因是用地单位不重视节约用地，工程设计不准确，没有精密的计划，加以领导方面存在官僚主义，没有详细审核，以致造成土地的浪费。例如国营西北第一棉纺织厂一九五一年在咸阳市征用土地一千一百零八亩，实际上只用了七百一十七亩。也有的用地单位单纯为了占地和使用上级拨给的建设经费，而征用了过多的土地。例如宝鸡木材支公司拟修建房屋三十余间，只需要五亩地，但上级拨发的建设经费很多，为了把这些钱都用掉，就征用了四十九亩土地。各级民政部门对建设单位征用土地的审批制度也执行得不严格，审批时只凭用地单位所提的计划，征用后又没有认真检查。
    为了今后合理地处理各单位征而未用的土地，防止浪费和荒芜现象继续发生，我们建议：
    一、凡是用地单位没有建筑计划或不准备修建的土地，一律由当地县（市）人民委员会收回，交给无地或少地的群众耕种，并酌情收适当租金，作为地方财政收入。但交给农民耕种时必须说明，当国家需要时即无偿收回。群众种植的青苗，如因急于施工必须铲除时，由施工单位负责补偿。这些土地也可以无偿地拨给其他单位使用，但事先应同原用地单位联系，若原用地单位提出可靠资料证明确实需用时，应予保留。对已用围墙圈起来的没有使用的土地，应该由当地人民委员会同用地单位研究，在不影响保卫工作的原则下，交给群众耕种。
    二、用地单位应该根据实际需要和节约用地的原则，周密计划，确实做到用多少征多少。各级民政部门也应该认真执行审批制度，严格审核，不施工而铲除青苗的行为要严加禁止。
    三、各专署和县人民委员会对境内已经征用的土地，应作一次全面深入的检查，如发现有荒芜、浪费土地的情况，应根据上述意见加以处理。
