The livestock team of a certain unit in the Manas Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps has successfully used cottonseed hulls to make fermented feed for dairy cows. By using this feed, the livestock team saved about one-half of the concentrated feed daily. After feeding for a week, milk production generally increased by one to two pounds. Cow No. 28 increased from 8 pounds of milk per day to 19 pounds, and cow No. 37 increased from 9 pounds of milk per day to 22 pounds. This experiment not only saved limited concentrated feed and reduced the cost of animal husbandry, but also effectively utilized cottonseed hulls, which were otherwise useless waste on the farm. More importantly, it overcame the difficulty of lacking feed for the large-scale development of animal husbandry in the future.

The method of making this feed is as follows: first, boil the cottonseed hulls for 30 minutes to soften them, then put them in wooden buckets, add 40% wheat bran, and add salt according to the needs of each cow, stir well, cover the wooden bucket, ferment for 12 to 18 hours, and then briefly dissipate heat to release the large amount of strong acidic irritating odor accumulated during the fermentation process before feeding. Well-processed cottonseed hulls have a strong fragrance and a slight, excellent silage corn acid taste, which livestock love to eat.

    玛纳斯垦区某部畜牧队试用棉桃壳作饲料获得成功
    新疆军区生产部队玛纳斯垦区某部畜牧队，试用棉桃壳制成发酵饲料喂奶牛获得成功。这个畜牧队试用这种饲料，每天节省了精料二分之一左右，饲养一周后，产奶量普遍提高了一至二磅，二十八号牛并由日产奶八磅增至十九磅，三十七号牛由日产奶九磅增至二十二磅。这一试验结果，不仅节省了有限的精料饲料，降低了畜牧业的成本，并使农场中作为废物无法处理的棉桃壳得到有效利用，更为今后大量发展畜牧业克服了缺乏饲料的困难。
    这种饲料的制法是：先把棉桃壳煮沸三十分钟使它软化，然后盛入木桶，加入百分之四十的小麦麸，再按每头牛的需要量加入食盐，搅拌均匀，将木桶盖好，发酵十二至十八小时，再给短时间的散热，使发酵过程中积蓄的大量强度酸性刺激气味散发出去，即可饲用。处理得好的棉桃壳，带有浓厚的香味和轻微的优良青贮玉米酸味，牲畜很爱吃。　（本报集体通讯员新疆日报编辑部）
