Parts of Hubei Province Launch Fight Against Drought

Since May, Hubei Province has experienced prolonged drought and little rainfall. Mountainous and hilly areas already experiencing drought are launching a campaign to prevent and combat drought. Drought-stricken areas are paying special attention to developing new water sources. In Xinzhou County, Xingzha and Hedong townships mobilized 1,200 people to build two large weirs and enclose seven bottom weirs in two days, ensuring that 10,000 mu of paddy fields in five townships will not lack water for fifty days. In the Ma'anshan area of ​​Jiangling County, seven townships opened a total of fourteen water sources, enhancing the drought resistance capacity of more than 2,100 mu of paddy fields. At the same time, drought-stricken areas have established and improved water management organizations, paying attention to rational water use. In Chengguan District of Jingshan County, thirteen townships have established water conservation and drought resistance committees. All 290 large weirs and dams in the district are managed by dedicated personnel, and covenants for saving water have been established. After implementing rational irrigation in Changsheng Township, Fang County, all of the more than 150 mu of fields that were originally unable to transplant rice seedlings have been planted. For drought-stricken dry crops such as cotton, farmers in various places are carrying out watering to protect seedlings and cultivating seedlings for transplantation.

    湖北部分地区展开抗旱斗争
    五月份以后，湖北省久旱少雨，已经发生旱象的山区和丘陵地区，正在展开防旱抗旱斗争。各受旱地区特别注意开辟新的水源。新洲县刑榨、河东两个乡发动了一千二百人两天修两个大堰，围七个底堰，保证了五个乡一万亩水田五十天不缺水。江陵县马山区有七个乡，一共开辟了十四处水源，增强了二千一百多亩水田的抗旱能力。和这同时，受旱地区都建立和健全了管水组织，注意合理用水。京山县城关区有十三个乡建立了保水抗旱委员会，全区二百九十多口大堰和大壋，都有专人管理，订立了节约用水的公约。房县长胜乡实行合理灌水以后，原来无水插秧的一百五十多亩田，全部插上了秧。对于受旱的棉花等旱作物，各地农民都在进行浇水保苗、育苗移栽等工作。
