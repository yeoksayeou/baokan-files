Eliminate All Covert Saboteurs
　　Chen Wen
The three batches of materials concerning the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique published in the "People's Daily" have thoroughly exposed the political background of this counter-revolutionary clique. This clique is a mixture of rotten "dregs," and literary activities are only their guise; counter-revolution is their real work.

This gang of insidious and venomous, incorrigible counter-revolutionary thugs have consistently and resolutely opposed the Chinese people for twenty years. They used cunning and deceitful double-dealing tactics, disguised as "progressive writers who followed the revolution," wore the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, and on the one hand, openly promoted reactionary subjective idealism to poison the Chinese people, and on the other hand, infiltrated the revolutionary ranks to carry out various organized and planned sabotage and divisive activities. This counter-revolutionary clique frantically hated the people's democratic dictatorship and everything in the new society, and dreamed of the demise of our Party and the people's revolutionary regime. Of course, this was done according to the will of their masters.

The destructive activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique were all-pervasive. They not only infiltrated government organs, economic departments, and cultural publishing organs, etc., but also infiltrated some organs of the People's Army, committing many unspeakable deeds. Hu Feng element Niu Han had infiltrated our People's Air Force for as long as two years. At the end of 1950, this loyal follower of Hu Feng, under the cover of the solemn banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, infiltrated a leading organ of our People's Air Force. He put on the uniform of a soldier of the Chinese People's Air Force and published his poem "Window" "praising" the heroic struggle of the Korean people. See how much he looks like a soldier with the spirit of internationalism and patriotism! But all of this was false. At the same time, he maintained close contact with the counter-revolutionary culprit Hu Feng. In his letter to Hu Feng, he gritted his teeth and cursed the new society and the revolutionary ranks, and even regarded the revolutionary people's resolute suppression of counter-revolutionary elements as "China's shame," and he was "very angry." Hu Feng once conducted counter-revolutionary education on this "relatively pessimistic" (People's Daily note on June 10) counter-revolutionary element, in a way of explaining through his own experience, and asked Niu Han to learn Hu Feng's "sharpening my sword, watching the direction, and when I am sure, I am willing to cut off my head and throw it out..." such counter-revolutionary spirit. Niu Han did not fail the education of this culprit after all. He deceived the position of a member of a branch of the Chinese Communist Party, actively disrupted the normal progress of the "Three-Anti" movement in his unit, attacked the leadership, and carried out other destructive activities. Look, how insidious and cunning the Hu Feng elements are, they are truly the offspring of a mixed marriage between jackals and foxes!

Despite the fact that these counter-revolutionary elements were very clever in their disguise and concealment, they finally could not escape the discerning eyes of the people. The exposure of this counter-revolutionary clique is a major victory we have achieved in the new historical period, in a more acute and complex class struggle. However, there must still be Hu Feng elements who continue to play double-dealing tactics, for their counter-revolutionary "cause" and "greater future," "seeking rebirth in endurance," in order to seize the opportunity to counterattack. We must expand the fruits of victory, completely annihilate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, and completely eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements!

    清除一切暗害分子
  　陈文
    “人民日报”发表的三批关于胡风反革命集团的材料，已经彻底揭穿了这个反革命集团的政治背景。这个集团是一堆腐朽的“渣子”的混合体，文艺活动只是他们的幌子，反革命才是他们的工作。
    这批阴险毒辣，怙恶不悛的反革命黑帮，二十年来始终坚决地同中国人民为敌，运用狡诈欺骗的两面派手法，伪装成“追随革命的进步作家”，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，一方面公开宣传反动的主观唯心论，毒害中国人民，一方面打入革命队伍内部，进行种种有组织有计划的暗害、分裂活动。这个反革命集团疯狂地仇恨人民民主专政和新社会的一切，梦想我们的党和人民革命政权的灭亡。当然，这是按照他们主子的意旨去做的。
    胡风反革命集团的破坏活动，是无孔不入的。他们不仅钻进了政府机关、经济部门，以及文化出版机关等等，而且也钻进了人民军队的某些机关，干下了许多不可告人的勾当。胡风分子牛汉就曾经混进到我人民空军达两年之久。一九五○年底，这个胡风的忠实走卒，在庄严的抗美援朝的旗帜掩蔽下，混入了我人民空军某领导机关。他穿起了中国人民空军战士的服装，发表了他那“歌颂”朝鲜人民英勇斗争的诗：“窗口”。你看他多么像一个具有国际主义和爱国主义精神的战士！可是，这些都是假的。与此同时，他同反革命罪魁胡风保持着紧密的联系。在他给胡风的信中，咬牙切齿地咒骂新社会和革命队伍，竟把革命人民对于反革命分子坚决镇压的行动，认为“是中国的耻辱”，他“气愤得很”。对于这个“比较悲观的”（六月十日“人民日报”按语）反革命分子，胡风曾经以现身说法的方式，进行了反革命的教育，让牛汉学习胡风“磨我的剑，窥测方向，到我看准了的时候，我愿意割下我的头颅抛掷出去……”这样的反革命精神。牛汉到底没有辜负这个罪魁的教育。他骗取了中国共产党一个支部的委员的职务，积极地破坏所在单位“三反”运动的正常进行，攻击领导，施展其他破坏活动。看，胡风分子多么阴险狡猾，他们真是豺狼和狐狸的混血儿！
    尽管这些反革命分子伪装和隐蔽得十分巧妙，终于逃不出人民的慧眼。这个反革命集团的被揭穿，是我们在新的历史时期，在更加尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中取得的一次重大胜利。但是，一定还有胡风分子继续玩弄两面派手法，为了他们反革命的“事业”和“更远大的未来”，“在忍受中求得重生”，以便伺机反扑。我们必须把胜利战果扩大下去，使胡风反革命集团全军覆没，并把一切暗藏的反革命分子完全清除干净！
