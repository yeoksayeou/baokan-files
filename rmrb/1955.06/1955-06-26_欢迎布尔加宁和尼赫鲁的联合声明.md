Welcoming the Joint Statement of Bulganin and Nehru

Indian Political Figures

    The "Hindustan Times" wrote that political figures in Delhi welcomed the joint statement issued by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru, considering it a historically significant document that will become an important factor in easing international tensions and promoting understanding between countries with different social and political systems.

    Indian Minister of Home Affairs, Pant, welcomed the Soviet-Indian joint statement, pointing out that this statement is in line with India's policy of peace.

    The General Secretary of the Indian National Congress, Shriman Narayan Agarwal, believed that this statement is a historically significant document that will play a huge role in guaranteeing peace. He said: "Although there are some fundamental differences in economic and social ideologies between India and the Soviet Union, they can cooperate with each other in many aspects. We look forward to Marshal Bulganin's visit to India with great interest."

Pakistani Prime Minister

    Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali told reporters in Calcutta on the 24th, on his way back to Karachi from Dhaka, that he welcomed the joint statement of Bulganin and Nehru.

    Ali said that this statement definitely showed a sincere attitude towards world peace.

    Ali mentioned that the statement supplemented the third item of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—"non-interference in internal affairs"—with: "non-interference in internal affairs for any reason of an economic, political or ideological nature." He said that this principle is "more comprehensive and a step further than the Bandung Conference declaration."

Sri Lankan Government and Political Figures

    Sri Lankan officials welcomed the joint statement of Nehru and Bulganin, considering it an "auspicious sign for world peace."

    A spokesperson for the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs told a reporter from the Indian Press Trust that "this is encouraging news."

    The Leader of the Opposition in the Sri Lankan House of Representatives, Bandaranaike, said that the statement affirmed the principles of peaceful coexistence and "reiterated the strongest desire for peace." He said, "It is hoped that Western countries will also take action following this peace initiative."

    The leader of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka, Pieter Keuneman, said, "The most populous countries in the world, representing more than half of humanity, have accepted the 'Five Principles' as an effective basis for achieving peaceful coexistence. This strengthens the forces of peace."

Burmese Newspapers

    Major Burmese newspapers all published news about the joint statement issued by Bulganin and Nehru on the 24th. The "Burma New Era" newspaper specifically mentioned that the joint statement talked about the necessity to ban thermonuclear weapons, restore the seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and return Taiwan to the People's Republic of China. The Burmese-language "Tun Daily" published an article on this news with the title: "From the Volga to the Ganges." The article said that the joint statement issued by Bulganin and Nehru was possible because the people of India and the Soviet Union earnestly hoped to prevent a new world war.

Indonesian Newspapers

    Indonesian newspapers prominently published the joint statement of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru. The "People's Daily" pointed out that Nehru's visit to the Soviet Union, Sastroamidjojo's visit to Beijing, and the visit of the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by Ho Chi Minh to Beijing and Moscow, "are a series of major events in consolidating the cause of peace in Asia and the world."

    欢迎布尔加宁和尼赫鲁的联合声明
    印度政界人士
    “印度斯坦时报”写道，德里政界人士欢迎苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和印度总理尼赫鲁所发表的联合声明，认为这是一个具有历史意义的文件，它将成为缓和国际紧张局势、促进不同社会和政治制度的国家之间的谅解的重要因素。
    印度内政部长潘特欢迎苏印联合声明，他指出，这个声明符合印度的和平政策。
    印度国大党总书记希里曼·纳拉扬·阿葛尔瓦认为这个声明是一个具有历史意义的文件，它将在保障和平方面起巨大的作用。他说：“虽然印度和苏联两国在经济和社会意识形态方面存在着一些基本的原则上的差异，但是它们在许多方面是可以互相合作的。我们以极大的兴趣期待着布尔加宁元帅访问印度。”
    巴基斯坦总理
    巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里二十四日在从达卡返回喀喇蚩途中经过加尔各答时，对记者表示欢迎布尔加宁和尼赫鲁的联合声明。
    阿里说，这个声明肯定地表明了对世界和平的真诚态度。
    阿里提到声明把和平共处五项原则的第三项——“互不干涉内政”——补充为：“互不借任何经济、政治或意识形态性质的理由干涉内政”。他说，这项原则“更加全面，比万隆会议宣言更进一步”。
    锡兰政府和政界人士
    锡兰官方人士对尼赫鲁和布尔加宁的联合声明表示欢迎，认为这是“世界和平的吉兆”。
    锡兰外交部的发言人对印度报业托辣斯记者说，“这是一个令人鼓舞的消息”。
    锡兰众议院反对党领袖班达拉纳克说，声明申明了和平共处的原则，并“重申对和平的最强烈的愿望。”他说，“希望西方国家也将继这种和平的倡议以后采取行动。”
    锡兰共产党领袖彼得·克尼曼说，“代表半数以上人类的世界上人口最众多的国家已经接受‘五项原则’作为实现和平共处的有效基础。这就加强了和平的力量。”
    缅甸报纸
    缅甸各大报二十四日都刊载了关于布尔加宁和尼赫鲁发表联合声明的消息。“缅甸新时代报”特别提到联合声明中谈到必须禁止热核子武器，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的席位，并把台湾还给中华人民共和国的那一部分。缅甸文“吞日报”就这一消息刊载了一篇文章，标题是：“从伏尔加河到恒河”。文章说，布尔加宁同尼赫鲁发表联合声明之所以成为可能，是由于印度和苏联两国人民热切地希望防止发生新的世界大战。
    印度尼西亚报纸
    印度尼西亚各报以显著地位刊载了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和印度总理尼赫鲁的联合声明。“人民日报”指出，尼赫鲁访问苏联，沙斯特罗阿米佐约访问北京和以胡志明为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团访问北京和莫斯科，“是巩固亚洲和世界和平事业的一系列重大事件”。
