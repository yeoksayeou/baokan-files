Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 7th: The US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique have recently intensified the training of so-called "special forces" on Jinmen (Quemoy) Island to carry out armed harassment, sabotage, and reconnaissance activities against our coastal areas.

According to confessions from Chen Chuming, Zhou Mengwu, Li Guoguo, and Chen Mingxing, soldiers of the search platoon of the 206th Regiment of the 69th Division of the Chiang bandit army, who were captured by our army in the Haicheng County area, the Chiang bandit army on Jinmen Island extensively expanded and newly established "search regiments," "search companies," and "search platoons" and other "special forces" in late March. Personnel from the "Special Squadron" trained by the US intelligence agency "Western Enterprises Corporation, Dachen Branch" served as instructors and conducted training. The training content mainly included methods of sabotage and special techniques used after armed landing. Chen Chuming and others attended a training class of the Chiang bandit 69th Division for more than a month. During the training period, Yu Boyin, commander of the Chiang bandit 69th Division, deputy commander Chen Weinuo, and personnel from the Chiang bandit "Kinmen Defense Department" constantly went to give speeches. These Chiang bandit officers emphasized in their speeches that armed landing was a "comprehensive action" of the Chiang bandit army, and they should learn the techniques as soon as possible in order to carry out harassment and sabotage activities on the mainland.

According to Chen Chuming and others, their armed landing in the Haicheng County area on May 20 was the beginning of this "comprehensive action." Before the landing, the Chiang bandit army made many preparations for them. Liu Biao, a major intelligence officer of the Chiang bandit 69th Division, flew over the landing site to view the terrain. The personnel participating in the landing conducted multiple exercises. When departing, there were warships and gunboats to provide cover. The ship was equipped with two radios and two walkie-talkies in order to report the situation to the Chiang bandit "Kinmen Defense Department" and the Taiwan Chiang bandit army command in a timely manner and listen to instructions. Guo Yong, commander of the Chiang bandit 8th Army, personally went to the pier to see them off when they departed, encouraging them to "achieve results and set an example." However, due to our strict coastal defense, this group of Chiang bandit troops was captured alive by our local armed forces and militiamen shortly after landing.

    美国和蒋贼训练“特别部队”
    企图武装骚扰我沿海地区
    新华社福州七日电　美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团最近在金门岛上加紧训练对我国沿海地区进行武装骚扰、破坏和侦察活动的所谓“特别部队”。
    据在海澄县境被我军俘掳的原蒋贼军六十九师二零六团搜索排士兵陈初明、周梦武、李郭国和陈明兴等供认，金门岛上蒋贼军在三月下旬普遍扩充和新建了“搜索团”“搜索连”“搜索排”等“特别部队”，由美国特务机关“西方企业公司大陈分公司”训练出来的“特别中队”的人员充任教官，进行训练。训练内容主要是武装登陆后所使用的破坏方法和特种技术。陈初明等曾在蒋贼六十九师的训练班里学了一个多月。受训期间，蒋贼六十九师师长俞伯音、副师长陈威挪和蒋贼“金门防卫部”人员曾不断去训话。这些蒋贼军官在训话中都强调武装登陆是蒋贼军的一个“全面行动”，要他们早日学好技术，以便到大陆进行骚扰、破坏活动。
    据陈初明等供认，他们五月二十日在海澄县境的武装登陆就是这个“全面行动”的开始。登陆前蒋贼军曾为他们进行了许多准备工作。蒋贼军六十九师少校情报官刘彪曾坐飞机来登陆地点上空看过地形，参加登陆的人员曾进行过多次演习。出发时，有军舰、炮艇掩护，船上装有两部电台和两部步行机，以便及时向蒋贼“金门防卫部”和台湾蒋贼军指挥机关报告情况，听取指挥。蒋贼第八军军长郭永在他们出发时还亲到码头送行，勉励他们“获得成绩，做个榜样”。但由于我海防守卫严密，这批蒋贼军登陆后不久就被我地方武装和民兵活捉。
