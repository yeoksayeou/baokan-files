Xinhua News Agency, June 21st dispatch from Budapest: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) has called on youth worldwide to launch a powerful protest movement to force the West German authorities to release persecuted West German youth peace fighters Jupp Angenfort and Wolfgang Seiffert.

Angenfort and Seiffert are both leaders of the Free German Youth League of West Germany. They were sentenced by the West German Federal Constitutional Court on June 4, 1955, to five years of hard labor and four years of imprisonment, respectively, for fighting for peace and opposing war preparations and conscription.

The WFDY Secretariat's appeal stated that Angenfort and Seiffert embodied the unwavering will of German youth to fight for peace and friendship. The appeal called for launching a powerful movement like the one to rescue French youth Henri Martin and others, to restore freedom to Angenfort and Seiffert.

In Germany, a movement demanding the release of Angenfort and Seiffert is underway. The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League, with 3.5 million members, has issued a statement demanding the immediate release of Angenfort and Seiffert. Hannes Köhler, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Free German Youth League, also called on "all parties, organizations, and international democrats" to fight for the freedom of Angenfort and Seiffert. Workers throughout East Germany have widely launched movements to support Angenfort and Seiffert. Workers and youth in West Germany have also protested against the sentencing of Angenfort and Seiffert, and many university students have written letters to the two young peace fighters expressing their support.

    世界民主青联书记处号召全世界青年
    展开要求释放西德青年和平战士的运动
    新华社二十一日讯　布达佩斯消息：世界民主青年联盟书记处呼吁全世界青年展开强有力的抗议运动，迫使西德当局释放被迫害的西德青年和平战士尤普·安根福特和沃尔夫冈·塞弗特。
    安根福特和塞弗特都是西德自由德国青年联盟的领导人，他们由于争取和平，反对备战和征兵，在一九五五年六月四日被西德联邦宪法法院分别判处了五年苦役和四年监禁。
    世界民主青年联盟书记处的呼吁书指出：安根福特和塞弗特体现了德国青年为争取和平和友谊而斗争的不可动摇的意志。呼吁书号召展开像营救法国青年亨利·马丁等人那样强有力的运动，来使安根福特和塞弗特恢复自由。
    在德国，要求释放安根福特和塞弗特的运动正在展开。拥有三百五十万盟员的自由德国青年联盟中央委员会已经发表声明，要求立即释放安根福特和塞弗特。自由德国青年联盟中央委员会书记汉奈斯·柯希并且呼吁“一切党派、团体和国际民主人士”进行斗争，以使安根福特和塞弗特获得自由。民主德国各地的工人广泛地展开了声援安根福特和塞弗特的运动。西德的工人和青年也纷纷抗议对安根福特和塞弗特判刑，许多大学生写信给这两个青年和平战士，表示支持他们。
