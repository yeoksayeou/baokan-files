Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo delivered a radio address on June 2nd. The recording of the speech was broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station on the 7th. The full text is as follows:
    Friends:
    It is a great honor for me to have this opportunity to extend the warmest greetings on behalf of the Indonesian people to our friendly neighbor, the Chinese people.
    Indonesia and China have been friendly neighbors since long before our two countries first had maritime trade routes. Chinese ships not only brought goods, but also many Chinese merchants, workers, and artisans who settled in our country, bringing Chinese technology and ancient culture. Even now, many of our islands still retain the essence of this Chinese culture.
    Not long ago, both China and Indonesia achieved victory after long and arduous revolutionary struggles, and our two countries have inherited our previous friendly relations. However, this time, the friendly and cooperative relationship between Indonesia and China is built on a new foundation.
    Two new independent and sovereign nations have emerged in the world. Both of our countries are striving for a legitimate position in the world, and especially for the sake of our two peoples, we need peace and prosperity.
    Because we have common aspirations, the friendly relations between our two countries are even closer, even though we have different political and economic systems.
    Therefore, although our views may differ, we can reach agreements on matters of common interest. For example, our two countries have already concluded a trade agreement, and have also reached an agreement on the complex issue of dual nationality for overseas Chinese in Indonesia.
    The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung not long ago fully demonstrated that our two countries, as well as twenty-seven other Asian and African countries, need peace. This point was also reflected in the resolutions and recommendations formulated by the Asian-African Conference on how to achieve peace. Our two countries can further lay the foundation for promoting economic and cultural cooperation. This cooperation will benefit all Asian and African countries.
    My visit to China this time is at the invitation of your government and Premier Zhou Enlai. Your Premier, with his conciliatory attitude and wisdom, made a great contribution to the success of the Bandung Conference. The purpose of my visit this time is to continue the negotiations on the issues that your Premier discussed with me in Indonesia. On the other hand, I am very eager to further understand your great country. In both of these aspects, my visit has been very successful.
    Your Premier and I had several very friendly and warm meetings. I am convinced that we have once again made a considerable contribution to consolidating the friendship between our two countries. At the same time, we exchanged valuable opinions on important current world issues, especially those related to Asia.
    Moreover, as I just said, my visit to China this time is to further understand our great neighbor and all its achievements in seeking the happiness of its people.
    In this regard, our visit has also been very successful. Thanks to your country's hospitality, we have seen your tremendous efforts in building your country. In China, I have visited many places and scenic spots, and have had talks with people from all walks of life. Wherever I went, I was surrounded by friendship and warmth. We have learned a lot.
    I can say with certainty that your achievements in labor and the spirit shown by your people in achieving a common goal have left me with an extremely deep impression.
    Friends, in my personal name and on behalf of the people who came with me this time, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the government of the People's Republic of China and to our Chinese friends for your warm hospitality and sincere friendship.
    I wish you happiness and prosperity, and I am confident that the friendly relations existing between our two countries will be increasingly consolidated and strengthened, and will continue forever.
    Thank you!

    沙斯特罗阿米佐约发表广播演说
    新华社七日讯　印度尼西亚共和国总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约六月二日发表广播演说，演说词录音已由中央人民广播电台在七日播送，全文如下：朋友们：
    我这次能有机会代表印度尼西亚人民向我们友好的邻邦，中国人民，致以最热诚的问候，是十分荣幸的。
    远在我们两国第一次通航有海上贸易以来，印度尼西亚便和中国一直是友好的邻邦。中国的航船不仅带来了货物，随之而来的还有许多中国商人、工人、手工业者，他们在我国定居下来，带来了中国的技术和古老的文化，直到现在，我国许多的岛屿上还保留着这些中国文化的精华。
    不久以前，中国和印度尼西亚都经过长期艰巨的革命斗争，才获得了胜利，我们两国又继承了以往的友好关系。但是，这次印度尼西亚和中国的友好合作关系，是建立在新的基础上的。
    两个独立自主的新国家出现在世界上。我们两国都在争取在世界上的合法地位，尤其为了我们两国的人民，我们都需要和平，需要繁荣。
    因为我们具有共同的愿望，我们两国的友好关系便更加密切，尽管我们所采取的政治经济制度是不同的。
    因此，虽然我们的观点各有不同，我们对于有关共同利益的问题，是可以达成协议的。例如，我们两国已经缔订了贸易协定，对印度尼西亚的华侨双重国籍的繁难问题也取得了协议。
    不久以前在万隆举行的亚非会议，充分地证明了我们两国以及其他二十七个亚非国家是需要和平的。这一点在亚非会议对如何得到和平所拟定的决议和建议中也表现了出来。我们两国可以更进一步地为促进经济文化合作奠定基础。这个合作将会使一切亚非国家蒙受利益。
    我这次到中国访问是应贵国政府和周恩来总理的邀请。你们的总理以和解的态度和智慧曾对于万隆会议的成就作出了巨大的贡献。我这次访问的目的，是对你们总理在印度尼西亚和我所谈的问题，再作继续的谈判。另一方面，我是非常想更进一步地了解你们伟大的国家。从这两方面来说，我这次的访问是十分成功的。
    你们的总理和我几次的会谈都是很友好的，很热诚的。我确信，我们又一次对巩固两国之间的友谊作了相当大的贡献。同时，我们对于世界目前重要问题，尤其是有关亚洲的问题，交换了宝贵的意见。
    不仅如此，我刚才已经说过，我这次访问中国是要更进一步地了解我们这个伟大的邻邦，它在谋求人民幸福各方面所有的成就。
    在这方面，我们的访问也是十分成功的。由于贵国的盛情款待，我们看到了你们在建设你们的国家的巨大努力。在中国我访问过了许多地方和名胜，并曾和各界人士会谈过，无论我到那里，处处都充满着友谊和热诚。我们学习了很多的东西。
    我肯定地说，你们的劳动成就，和你们人民为实现一个共同的目标所表现的精神，都给我留下了极其深刻的印象。
    朋友们，我以个人的名义并且代表这次和我同来的人们，向中华人民共和国政府，向中国的朋友们，对我们这次盛情的款待，诚挚的友谊，表示万分感激。
    我敬祝你们快乐和繁荣，而且我敢肯定地说，在贵我两国之间所存在着的友好关系，将要日益巩固与加强，永永远远地继续下去。
    谢谢！
