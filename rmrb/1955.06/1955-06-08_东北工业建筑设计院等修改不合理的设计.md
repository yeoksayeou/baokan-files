The Northeast Industrial Architectural Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the East China Industrial Architectural Design Institute, and the Design Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, in conjunction with studying the documents of the All-Soviet Conference of Architectural Workers, have revised unreasonable design drawings that have not yet been implemented, avoiding substantial waste. According to statistics from the Northeast Industrial Architectural Design Institute on May 5, the departments have already reduced project costs by more than 1.61 million yuan for the state by eliminating excessive decoration and using local materials. Among them, the standardized design for employee dormitories in 1955, after modification, is not only more economical but also more suitable for living. Based on an annual calculation of 400,000 square meters of this type of standardized employee dormitory, the state can save more than 766,000 yuan. The East China Industrial Architectural Design Institute, by modifying the design drawings of the Hangzhou Pingfeng Mountain Sanatorium, the Shanghai Metal Processing Factory, the Shenyang Technical School building, and six dormitories of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant alone, has saved the state more than 172,000 yuan. The Design Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau has already modified approximately 400 drawings, removing some unnecessary decorations from the original designs. For the Jiangsu Provincial Foreign Affairs Office's Peace Building architectural drawings alone, after three revisions, the 600 cubic meters of glass tile roofing and some purely decorative features such as eaves and brackets were eliminated, and the inefficient ancillary buildings were reduced, saving the state approximately 300,000 yuan in wealth.

    东北工业建筑设计院等修改不合理的设计
    建筑工程部东北工业建筑设计院、华东工业建筑设计院和江苏省建筑工程局设计室，结合学习全苏建筑工作者会议文件，修改尚未施工的不合理的设计图纸，避免了大量浪费。东北工业建筑设计院据五月五日统计，各部门在取消过分装饰以及采用地方材料项目上，已经为国家降低工程造价一百六十一万多元。其中一九五五年职工宿舍定型设计经过修改后既省钱，又更适宜于居住。这种职工定型宿舍全年按四十万平方公尺计算，可为国家节约七十六万六千多元。华东工业建筑设计院仅对杭州屏风山疗养院、上海金属加工厂、沈阳技工学校的建筑物和第一汽车制造厂的六幢宿舍的设计图纸进行修改后，就为国家节约十七万二千多元。江苏省建筑工程局设计室已经修改图纸约四百张，去掉了原设计中的一些不必要的装饰。仅江苏省交际处和平大楼的建筑图纸，经过三次修改，取消了六百公方玻璃瓦屋面和一些出檐、斗拱等虚饰，削减了使用效率不大的附属建筑，就共为国家节省约三十万元的财富。
