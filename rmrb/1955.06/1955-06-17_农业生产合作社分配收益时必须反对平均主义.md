In the process of rectifying agricultural producers' cooperatives in the Yanbei region of Shanxi Province, it was discovered that many core members and some cooperative members had egalitarian ideas. Some practices adopted under the domination of this ideology have fostered laziness, dampened enthusiasm for labor, and infringed upon the interests of some cooperative members.

Some cooperatives have distorted and violated the distribution principles of "more work, more gain" and reasonable remuneration for land and means of production. These cooperatives have confused the "four retentions" standard in grain unified purchase with the principle of income distribution within the cooperative. Regardless of how much labor remuneration each household should receive and how much remuneration should be given for land and other means of production, grain was distributed to each household according to the number of people in the household.

The Houbali Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Zuoyun County distributed grain based on a standard of 22 *dou* per person, withholding the remainder for investment in the coming year and temporary borrowing by cooperative members. Households that participated in less labor and should have received less remuneration were also given 22 *dou* of grain per person, with three households receiving an overpayment of 860 *jin* of grain beyond their entitlement. After the sixteen households of cooperative members distributed grain according to the "four retentions" standard, there was still cash from the sale of 2,405 *jin* of grain, all of which was withheld by the cooperative. Farmers inside and outside the cooperative called this method "raising the low and padding the bottom." Many people complained, "No matter how much you work, it's always two *shi* and two *dou*; no matter how much more you work, beyond two *shi* and two *dou*, you won't see a penny. If you don't work, you still get that amount, so who has the mind to work actively?" As a result, eight cooperative members were unwilling to work in the cooperative and went outside to "find cash." The egalitarian method of distribution used by the Heizhouwan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Youyu County resulted in reduced income for middle peasants. Before joining the cooperative in 1953, cooperative member Zhang Baozhong produced 8,000 *jin* of yams and 14 large *shi* of grain; after joining the cooperative in 1954, based on the workdays he did and the remuneration for land and production investment, he should have received 75 *yuan* in cash in addition to the 1,050 *jin* of grain distributed according to the "four retentions" standard. However, he only received grain, and all the cash was withheld by the cooperative. Cooperative members were dissatisfied with this method and worked half-heartedly, without actively producing.

The situation in the Malianzhuang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Daren County was even more serious. Regardless of how much labor cooperative members performed or how much remuneration was due for means of production, each person was given 300 *jin* of grain. All 6,740 *yuan* from the sale of surplus grain by the entire cooperative was withheld and not distributed. The 7,993 *yuan* remuneration for cooperative members' privately owned means of production and the 16,082 *yuan* production investment were not returned. What were cooperative members to do for a living after this was done? The cooperative took care of everything using a supply system. When cooperative members had no vegetables to eat, the cooperative sent carts to buy 87,000 *jin* of turnips from other villages, distributing them according to the number of people in each household, and anyone who wanted more could take as much as they wanted. When cooperative members had no firewood, carts were sent to bring back charcoal, distributing 100 *jin* to each stove based on the number of stoves per household. When cooperative members got married, it was stipulated that the cooperative would lend them 50 to 70 *yuan* in cash and 200 *jin* of millet. (The entire cooperative spent a total of 1,400 *yuan* and 2,800 *jin* of millet on marriage expenses.) Even the money for women to buy thimbles and thread, and for elementary school students to buy paper, ink, brushes, and inkstones, was temporarily borrowed from the cooperative. Middle peasant Li Guoxian said, "This is truly the year of eating from the big pot!" As a result, cooperative members were not actively engaged in labor.

The mobile grain that the state left for surplus grain households during unified purchase was not distributed to cooperative members by many agricultural cooperatives but was used as the cooperative's "mobile grain" or "reward grain." Some cooperatives withheld a portion of the remuneration due to cooperative members in the name of helping impoverished households. In reality, the living problems of truly impoverished households were not solved, but instead, it created opportunities for favoritism and waste among the core members of the cooperative. For example, in the Malianzhuang cooperative, except for Deputy Director Li Ke, other committee members rarely worked. They borrowed large sums of money from the cooperative and arbitrarily spent it. Among them, Deputy Director and warehouse keeper Liu Ming only worked six workdays in a year but was given 65 workdays because of work delays for the cooperative; however, he embezzled 200 *yuan* of public funds and borrowed 100 *yuan* for personal use, spending it on smoking, drinking, and extravagance. Every core leader in the cooperative borrowed money from the cooperative, and the amounts were very large. Cooperative members complained, "No matter how much more is produced, those same few people are the ones eating it all; it seems these lazy people are squandering everything!"

Reasonable income distribution is a major aspect of implementing the principle of mutual benefit and is a decisive condition for promoting production and consolidating agricultural cooperatives. After discovering these problems, the Yanbei District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed all counties to deal with the distribution issues left over from the old cooperatives within a limited time. It is necessary to formulate reasonable distribution ratios for labor and land according to local conditions and specific cooperatives, to ensure that means of production invested in the cooperative receive reasonable remuneration, and to ensure that the amount of public funds retained is also appropriate. After the harvest, distribution should be completed within a limited time, and the entire distribution result should be announced to cooperative members and reported to the county for record-keeping. No one is allowed to withhold or delay the payment of remuneration due to cooperative members (including physical objects and cash from the sale of agricultural and sideline products), and no "mobile grain" or "reward grain" should be retained beyond the stipulated distribution items. Cooperatives that have not clearly settled the distribution work from the previous year should appoint a dedicated person to clarify the situation and settle the accounts during the rectification process.

Regarding the labor remuneration part of agricultural producers' cooperatives, it is imperative to adhere to the fundamental principles of "distribution according to work" and "more work, more gain," and resolutely oppose the ideological tendency of egalitarianism. Everyone must understand that socialist society is by no means a complete uniformity in life and absolutely does not allow those who do not work or are lazy to receive the same remuneration as those who work actively. Egalitarian methods can only destroy production and cannot develop it; they can only lead to the failure of the socialist transformation cause and will not bring any shadow of a socialist society at all. Some cooperatives have an egalitarian bias because the core members are trying to use this method to solve the problems of impoverished households. Of course, every agricultural cooperative should actively find ways to help impoverished households overcome difficulties in production and life; however, this problem should mainly be solved by organizing impoverished households to participate in production. For impoverished households who need help in life, cooperative members can be educated to establish a viewpoint of unity and mutual assistance, and the problem can be solved through mutual lending and the use of public welfare funds within the cooperative on a voluntary basis; if these methods still cannot solve the problem, the government should provide appropriate relief, and it is absolutely forbidden to withhold the remuneration due to some cooperative members as "mobile grain" for relief. Otherwise, it will inevitably affect the unity of poor and middle peasants and damage the cause of agricultural cooperation.

    农业生产合作社分配收益时必须反对平均主义
    马石纪
    山西省雁北地区在整顿农业生产合作社中，发现不少社的骨干分子和部分社员有平均主义思想。在这种思想支配下采取的一些做法，助长了懒惰，打击了劳动积极性，侵害了部分社员的利益。
    有些社歪曲和违反了“多劳多得”及土地、生产资料取得合理报酬的分配原则。这些社把粮食统购中的“四留”标准同社内分配收益的原则混淆了起来，不管各户应该得到劳动报酬多少和土地及其他生产资料的报酬多少，而按各户的人口给各户分配粮食。
    左云县后八里农业生产合作社，按每人二十二斗的标准分了粮食，把其余的扣留下来作为来年的投资和社员临时支借之用。参加劳动少、理应少得报酬的户，也照样每人分了二十二斗粮食，有三户超出其应得报酬而多分了八百六十斤粮食。十六户社员按“四留”标准分了粮食以后，还有卖出二千四百零五斤粮食的现金，都被扣留在社里。社内外农民把这个办法叫做“起高垫低”。好多人不满地说：“劳动多少，都是两石二；劳动再多，除了两石二，一个钱也见不上。不劳动也少不了这个数，谁还有什么心思积极干活？”因此，有八户社员不愿在社里干活，而到外边去“找现钱”去了。右玉县黑洲湾农业生产合作社用平均主义的办法分配的结果，使中农减少了收入。社员张保中一九五三年入社前生产了八千斤山药、十四大石粮食；一九五四年入社以后，按他做的劳动日和土地、生产投资的报酬计算，除按“四留”标准分得一千零五十斤粮食外，还应分取七十五元现金。但只分给粮食，现金全部被扣在社内。社员对这种办法不满，干半天歇半天，不积极生产。
    大仁县马连庄农业生产合作社的情况更为严重，不管社员劳动多少，生产资料报酬多少，每人都分给三百斤粮食，全社卖余粮款六千七百四十元，全部扣在社里未分，社员私有的生产资料的报酬七千九百九十三元和生产投资一万六千零八十二元都未归还。统购时国家给余粮户多留的百分之二十的机动粮五万三千三百斤也被扣留在社里。这样做了之后，社员的生活怎么办呢？就用供给制的办法由社包揽起来。社员没有菜吃，社里就派大车从外村买回萝卜八万七千斤，先按各户人数分了之后，余下的谁愿要多少就要多少。社员没烧柴，就派车拉回炭来，按户数灶，每个灶分给一百斤。社员结婚，规定由社借给现金五十到七十元，黍子二百斤。（全社共借支出结婚费一千四百元，黍子二千八百斤。）连妇女买顶针、针线，小学生买纸、墨、笔、砚花的钱，也都到社里临时借支。中农李果仙说：“这才是吃大锅饭的年头到了！”因此，社员都不积极劳动。
    统购时国家给余粮户留的机动粮，不少农业合作社没有分配给社员，而做了社里的“机动粮”或“奖励粮”。有些社以帮助困难户为名，扣留社员应得的报酬的一部分。实际结果，真正困难户的生活问题并未解决，反而造成了社内骨干分子的营私和浪费。如马连庄社，除副社长李科外，其他社务委员都很少劳动，他们在社里大量借款，任意借款。其中副社长兼保管员刘明，一年只做了六个劳动日，因为为社误工，给评了六十五个劳动日；但他却私自挪用公款二百元，借款一百元，抽烟喝酒胡花了。社内领导骨干人人向社借款，而且数额很大。社员反映：“再生产的多，吃东西的还是那几个人，光景都被这些懒汉蹧踏了！”
    合理地分配收益，是贯彻互利原则的一个主要方面，是促进生产、巩固农业合作社的决定性条件。中共雁北地委发现了上述这些问题以后，已经指示各县，限期处理老社的分配遗留问题。要因地因社制宜规定劳力和土地的合理分配比例，要使入社生产资料取得合理报酬，留出公共基金的数目也要适当；在收获结束后，应限期分配完结，并把全部分配结果向社员公布，报县备查；任何人不准扣留或拖欠、支借社员的应得报酬（包括实物和出卖农副业产品后的现金），不准在规定的分配项目之外，再留什么“机动粮”、“奖励粮”。目前没有一清二白地结束上年度的分配工作的社，应指定专人，在整顿过程中澄清情况，结清账目。
    对于农业生产合作社的劳动报酬的部分，必须坚持“按劳取酬”和“多劳多得”的根本原则，坚决反对平均主义的思想倾向。要使大家了解：社会主义社会绝不是生活上的完全划一，绝不允许不劳而食或偷懒的人也和积极劳动的人取得同样报酬。平均主义的办法，只能破坏生产，而不能使生产发展；只能使社会主义改造事业失败，而根本不会带来任何社会主义社会的影子。有些社发生平均主义的偏向，是社内骨干分子试想用这种办法解决困难户的问题。当然，任何农业合作社都应积极设法帮助贫苦户克服生产和生活上的困难；但是，这个问题主要应从组织困难户参加生产方面来解决。对于生活上需要帮助的贫苦户，可教育社员树立团结友爱的观点，在自愿条件下通过互相借贷和利用社内公益金去解决；用这些办法仍然解决不了问题时，应由政府给予适当的救济，绝对不可扣留一部分社员应得的报酬作为“机动粮”来救济。不然，就必然影响贫农中农的团结，损害农业合作化事业。
