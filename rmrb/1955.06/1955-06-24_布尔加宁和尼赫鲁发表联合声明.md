Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd dispatch from Moscow: TASS Moscow, June 23rd: On the 23rd, Soviet newspapers published the joint statement of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N. A. Bulganin, and the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. The full text of the statement is as follows:

At the invitation of the Soviet Government, the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited the Soviet Union. During his stay in Moscow, he held several talks with the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N. A. Bulganin, and other members of the Soviet Government. These talks took place in a friendly and sincere atmosphere and covered many issues of common concern to both countries and major issues of international significance in the current international situation.

Relations between the Soviet Union and India are fortunately built on a solid foundation of friendship and mutual understanding. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister believe that the following principles must continue to be followed in the relations between the two countries:

I. Mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

II. Mutual non-aggression.

III. Mutual non-interference in internal affairs for any economic, political, or ideological reasons.

IV. Equality and mutual benefit.

V. Peaceful coexistence.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister believe that these principles, which are recently gaining wider recognition, can be applied more broadly; and believe that the main hope for easing international tensions lies in all countries observing these principles in their mutual relations, thereby eliminating fear and doubt from the minds of all peoples. Wider recognition of these principles can expand the area of peace, help build mutual trust between countries, and pave the way for closer international cooperation. In a peaceful environment established in this way, it is possible to seek peaceful solutions to international problems through negotiation and reconciliation.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister believe that small and weak countries in various parts of the world have a vague, perhaps unfounded, fear of big countries. They believe that this fear must be eliminated by all possible means. The best way to do this is to strictly adhere to the above-mentioned principles of coexistence.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister welcome the results of the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April this year. This conference is of historical significance because it is the first of its kind in history: independent countries of various different political and social systems from two continents gathered together, their common purpose being to seek ways and means to establish fuller economic, cultural and political cooperation. The results of the conference are noteworthy and are of great significance not only to the participating countries, but also to the cause of world peace.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister are particularly pleased to express their satisfaction with the declaration on the promotion of world peace and cooperation adopted by the conference. The idea of peaceful coexistence is embodied and clarified in this declaration.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister believe that there are now signs of an improvement in the overall international situation. They particularly welcome: the easing of tensions in the Far East; the restoration of Austria's independence; the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia; and the increasingly keen and widespread understanding of the dangers of war in the atomic age that can be felt everywhere. However, fear and suspicion still dominate the consciousness of individuals and some countries in vast areas, poisoning international relations. In the Far East, although tensions have eased somewhat, the causes of the tensions remain.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister sincerely hope that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China to Taiwan will be satisfied through peaceful means. At the same time, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister reiterate their belief that the continued exclusion of the People's Republic of China from the United Nations is the root cause of many troubles in the Far East and other regions. They believe that the People's Republic of China must be granted its legitimate status in the United Nations, and that the role and prestige of the United Nations will thereby be enhanced. They also believe that it is important that all countries that meet the principles of membership in the United Nations Charter should be admitted to the United Nations.

The Soviet Union, as the country whose representative is one of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and India, as the country that provided the three chairmen to all three international commissions in Indochina, bear a special responsibility for the implementation of the Geneva Accords. These agreements are outstanding examples of resolving international conflicts through negotiation; and the extent of the achievements in implementing these agreements should be considered as a measure of the value of using negotiation as a means of resolving international differences. Therefore, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister have particularly studied the situation in Indochina. Despite various difficulties, which are sometimes of a serious nature, the overall situation of the implementation of the agreement to date is satisfactory.

The further implementation of this agreement is now under some threat of being undermined by some sudden new events. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister are willing to call upon the governments of all countries related to the implementation of the terms of the agreement to do everything possible to fulfill their obligations so that the goals of these agreements can be fully achieved. They particularly urge that, in places where elections should be a prerequisite for a political solution, the governments concerned should strive to fully implement the terms of the agreement.

Among the international issues of deep concern to all countries, the most urgent, that is, the issue that will have more serious consequences for war and peace, is the issue of disarmament. The trend of expanding conventional and atomic armaments has deepened the fears and suspicions of countries and diverted their resources from their proper purpose, namely, from improving the welfare of the people. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister believe that nothing should be allowed to hinder the complete prohibition of the production, testing and use of atomic and thermonuclear weapons. They also believe that conventional armaments should be reduced simultaneously and substantially, and that effective international supervision should be established and maintained over the implementation of such disarmament and prohibition. In this regard, the recent Soviet proposal on the issue of disarmament is considered a major contribution to the cause of peace.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister believe that, starting from the five principles announced in this statement, there is a wide range of activities for the development of cultural, economic, and technical cooperation between the two countries. The fact that each country implements a system formulated according to its own wisdom, traditions, and environment should not hinder this cooperation. Indeed, the foundation of true coexistence, as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister are convinced, is that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully and harmoniously and can work for common interests.

Remarkable progress has already been made in cultural and economic cooperation between the two countries, and the trade agreement signed not long ago has promoted this development. The recent agreement on Soviet government assistance to India in building a steel plant is a typical example of such cooperation. In view of the mutually beneficial nature of this cooperation, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister will strive to develop and consolidate the relations between the two countries in the economic and cultural fields, and in scientific and technological research.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister expressed their satisfaction at having this opportunity to personally discuss and exchange views on issues of common concern to them, and believe that the results of their talks and the friendly contacts that have been established will help to further consolidate and develop the relations between the two countries and the two peoples, and will contribute to the interests of world peace.

    布尔加宁和尼赫鲁发表联合声明
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和印度总理尼赫鲁联合声明的签字仪式，二十二日在大克里姆林宫在恳切友好的气氛中举行。
      二十时十五分，布尔加宁和尼赫鲁走向放着联合声明俄文和英文本的桌子，分别在声明上签字，签字后并且互相热烈地握手。参加联合声明签字仪式的人鼓掌表示欢迎。
    苏联方面出席仪式的有：卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、萨布罗夫、别尔乌辛、赫鲁晓夫、波斯伯洛夫、苏斯洛夫、苏联国防部长朱可夫，苏联元帅索科洛夫斯基，苏联外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯、库兹涅佐夫，“真理报”总编辑谢皮洛夫。

    新华社二十三日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十三日电：二十三日，苏联各报刊载了苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁和印度总理贾·尼赫鲁的联合声明。声明全文如下：
    印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁应苏联政府的邀请访问了苏联。他在莫斯科停留期间，曾同苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁和苏联政府其他人员进行了几次会谈。这些会谈在友好诚挚的气氛中进行，涉及了对两国共同关心的许多问题和目前国际局势中具有国际意义的重大问题。
    苏联同印度之间的关系有幸建立在友好和互相谅解的巩固基础上。部长会议主席和总理认为，在两国的关系中必须继续遵循下列原则：
    一、互相尊重彼此领土的完整和主权；
    二、互不侵犯；
    三、互不借任何经济、政治或意识形态性质的理由干涉内政；
    四、平等互利；
    五、和平共处。
    部长会议主席和总理认为，最近得到越来越普遍的承认的这些原则，可以更广泛地加以应用；并认为，消除各国人民意识中的恐惧和疑虑，从而缓和国际紧张局势的主要希望就寄托在各国在它们的相互关系中遵守这些原则上。这些原则得到更广泛的承认可以扩大和平地区，有助于树立各国之间的相互信任，并为更紧密的国际合作铺平道路。在这样建立起来的和平环境中，就有可能用谈判及和解的办法谋求国际问题的和平解决。
    部长会议主席和总理认为，世界各地的小国和弱国对大国有一种模糊的、可能是没有根据的恐惧。他们认为，必须用一切可能的办法来消除这种恐惧。在这方面最好的办法就是严格遵守上述的共处原则。
    部长会议主席和总理欢迎今年四月在万隆举行的亚非会议的结果。这次会议具有历史意义，因为这次会议就其类型来说在历史上还是第一次：两个洲的各种不同政治和社会制度的独立的国家聚集在一起，它们的共同目的是为建立更加充分的经济、文化和政治方面的合作而寻求道路和方法。会议的结果是值得注意的，这些结果不仅对于会议的参加国，而且对于全世界的和平事业都具有巨大的意义。
    部长会议主席和总理特别愿意对会议所通过的关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言表示满意。在这个宣言中体现和阐明了和平共处的主张。
    部长会议主席和总理认为，现在已经出现了总的国际局势趋于改善的迹象。他们特别欢迎：远东紧张局势的缓和；奥地利独立的恢复；苏联和南斯拉夫之间的关系的改善；以及随处都可觉察到的对于原子时代的战争的危险性的日见敏锐和日见普遍的了解。然而，恐惧和怀疑仍然在广大的地区的个人的意识中和一些国家中占着优势，毒害着国际关系。在远东，虽然紧张局势曾经有所缓和，但是造成紧张局势的原因依然存在。
    部长会议主席和总理真诚地希望，中华人民共和国对台湾的合法权利将有可能通过和平的方法得到满足。同时，部长会议主席和总理重申自己的信念，认为继续不让中华人民共和国进入联合国这种情况，是在远东和其他地区造成许多麻烦的根源。他们认为必须给予中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，联合国的作用和威信将因此而得到提高。他们还认为重要的是，一切符合于联合国宪章关于会员资格的原则的国家都应当被吸收入联合国。
    苏联，作为它的代表是日内瓦会议的两个主席中的一个主席的国家，印度，作为向印度支那所有三个国际委员会提供了三个主席的国家，对日内瓦协定的实现负有特别的责任。这些协定是利用谈判方法解决国际冲突的卓越范例；而在实现这些协定中所取得的成就的大小应当被认为是衡量用谈判的方法作为解决国际分歧的手段的价值的尺度。因此，部长会议主席和总理特别研究了印度支那的情况。虽然有种种困难，而且这些困难有时具有严重的性质，但执行协定的整个情况到现在为止是令人满意的。
      这个协定的进一步实现现在由于突然发生的一些新事件而有受到破坏的某种威胁。部长会议主席和总理愿意号召同实现协定的条款有关的各国政府竭尽一切可能去履行它们的义务，以使这些协定的目标得以完全达到。他们特别极力呼吁，在应以进行选举作为政治解决的先决条件的地方，有关政府应当努力促使完全实现协定的条款。
    在对各国有深切关系的国际问题中，最迫切的、即对战争与和平的问题会产生较严重后果的问题，莫过于裁军问题。扩充常规军备和原子军备的趋势加深了各国的恐惧和怀疑，使各国的资源离开应有的目的，即离开提高人民福利的目的。部长会议主席和总理认为，不应允许有任何东西阻挠完全禁止原子武器和热核子武器的生产、试验和使用。他们还认为，应当同时地和大量地裁减常规军备，应当对这种裁军和禁令的实施建立和保持有效的国际监督。在这方面，苏联最近提出的关于裁军问题的建议被认为是对和平事业的一个重大贡献。
    部长会议主席和总理认为，从本声明中所宣布的五项原则出发，两国的文化、经济和技术合作的发展就有了广泛的活动范围。每一个国家实行着根据它自己智慧、传统和周围环境所制定的制度，这一事实不应阻碍这种合作。的确，部长会议主席和总理所深信的真正共处的基础是：社会制度不同的国家可以和平和协调地密切共处，可以为共同的利益而工作。
    两国在文化和经济方面的合作已经取得了显著的发展，不久以前签订的贸易协定促进了这种发展。最近签订的关于苏联政府帮助印度建设炼钢厂的协定就是这种合作的一个典型的例子。部长会议主席和总理鉴于这种合作相互有利，将尽力发展和巩固两国在经济和文化方面、在科学和技术研究方面的关系。
    部长会议主席和总理对他们有此机会亲自就他们共同关心的问题进行讨论和交换意见表示满意，并相信：他们会谈的结果和已经建立起来的友好接触将有助于进一步巩固和发展两国和两国人民的关系，并将有助于世界和平的利益。
