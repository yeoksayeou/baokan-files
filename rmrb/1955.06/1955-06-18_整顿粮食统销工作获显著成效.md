Xinhua News Agency, 17th. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued instructions on stepping up the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale work, the trend of rising national grain sales began to ease after only twenty-odd days. According to statistics from the Ministry of Food, national grain sales in May decreased by 12.82% compared to April. Currently, wheat harvesting has begun in the Yellow River basin, and the easing of grain sales will continue. May is historically the month with the highest grain sales. Due to the existence of unreasonable phenomena in grain sales in various regions during the spring, national sales in April reached a peak. The decrease in sales in May is the result of local Party organizations and government departments mobilizing hundreds of thousands of staff to rectify unified purchase and sale in rural areas, reducing the unreasonable surge in sales in April.

At present, the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale in Jiangsu, Hubei, Henan, and Guangxi has been completed, and most of the townships in other provinces have also completed their work successively. Now, not only are there fewer voices calling for "grain shortage" in these areas, but many farmers are also taking their surplus grain to the state grain market for sale. In the state grain markets of Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, 30,000 to 40,000 jin of grain are traded every week. In the 42 state grain markets in the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province, more than 4 million jin of grain have been put on the market from the rectification of grain unified purchase and sale to the end of May. After the rectification of unified purchase and sale in 85 townships in Fusui County, Guangxi Province, the state's grain supply decreased. From May 1st to 18th, the grain department also purchased more than 110,000 jin of grain in the state grain market. In May, grain departments in various regions purchased a batch of surplus grain from the state grain market. According to statistics at the end of May, 95.66% of the national grain requisition and purchase plan for the 1954-1955 grain year has been completed.

    整顿粮食统销工作获显著成效
    新华社十七日讯　中共中央和国务院关于加紧整顿粮食统销工作的指示下达二十几天后，全国粮食销售量上升的趋势即开始缓和。据粮食部统计，五月份全国粮食销量比四月份下降了百分之十二点八二，目前，黄河流域已开始收麦，粮食销售缓和的情况还将继续下去。五月份是历年粮食销量最高的月份，春季由于各地粮食销售存在不合理现象，四月份全国销量即达到高峰，五月份出现销量下降的情况，是各地党组织和政府部门动员数十万名工作人员，在农村整顿统销，减少了四月份销量中不合理激增部分的结果。
    目前，江苏、湖北、河南、广西粮食统销的整顿工作已经结束，其他省份也有大部分乡相继结束。现在这些地区不但叫喊“缺粮”的声音少了，而且有许多农民把保存的余粮拿到国家粮食市场出售。湖北襄阳专区各地国家粮食市场上，每个星期都成交三万斤到四万斤粮食。青海省农业区的四十二个国家粮食市场，从整顿粮食统销到五月底，上市粮食达四百多万斤。广西省扶绥县八十五个乡整顿统销后，国家粮食供应量减少，五月一日到十八日内，粮食部门还在国家粮食市场上收购了十一万多斤粮食。五月份各地粮食部门收购了一批国家粮食市场上剩市的粮食。到五月底的统计，一九五四—一九五五粮食年度内国家粮食征、购计划已完成百分之九十五点六六。
