Esteemed Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Chairman of the Moscow Soviet, dear friends!

    Please forgive me for not being able to address you in your native language, Russian. Therefore, you must listen to the translation.

    We arrived in the Soviet Union two weeks ago, and soon we will be leaving this great country. During this period, we have traveled about 13,000 kilometers, visited many famous cities, and seen many moving things. But the most moving thing is the welcome we have received everywhere and the enthusiasm that the people have poured on us. We are infinitely grateful for such feelings and enthusiastic hospitality, and I can hardly express my gratitude to the Soviet people in words (stormy and prolonged applause). However, I would still like to express our gratitude to you, Mr. Chairman of the Council of Ministers, to your government, and to your people, and I ask you to convey this expression of our deep feelings to the Soviet people who have treated us so kindly (applause).

    We have come here to convey the respect and congratulations of the Indian people to the people of this great country (prolonged applause). We are returning full of your enthusiasm and wishes for our country and people (prolonged applause).

    We did not come here as strangers, because many of us have been watching with deep interest the tremendous changes and developments that have taken place in the Soviet Union.

    Almost at the same time as you carried out your October Revolution under the leadership of the great Lenin, we in India also began a new stage in the struggle for freedom. Our people have been engaged in this struggle for many years and have bravely and persistently dealt with heavy repression. Although we were following a different path of struggle under the leadership of Gandhi, we admired Lenin and were influenced by his example (prolonged applause). Despite our differences in method, there has never been any unfriendly feeling towards the Soviet people among our people. We were not very familiar with certain developments in your country, just as you may not have been very familiar with what we were doing. We wish the Soviet Union success in the great and novel experiment it is undertaking and wish to learn from it where possible.

    Our two countries have different backgrounds: their geography, history, traditions, culture, and the environments in which they are situated are all different.

    We believe that it is not good for one country to dominate another, and therefore, as we fought for our own freedom, we sympathized with the efforts of other countries suffering under foreign or autocratic rule to liberate themselves. Every country and people is limited by its own history and the experiences it has gone through, and therefore has a certain character. Under foreign rule, or if something is imposed on them from the outside, they cannot progress. They can only grow when they practice self-reliance, build their own strength, and maintain their own integrity. We must all learn from others and not isolate ourselves, but if this learning is compulsory, it cannot be effective.

    We believe in democracy, equality, and the elimination of privilege, and we have set ourselves the goal of building a socialist type of society in our country by peaceful means (stormy applause). Whatever type of socialism or democracy it may be, it must enable everyone to have knowledge and equal opportunities. It is precisely because of the recognition that every country has the right to determine its own destiny that the Indian government and the People's Government of China have agreed to guide mutual relations with five principles. These five principles are: mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. Later, Burma and Yugoslavia accepted these principles, and the Soviet government also expressed its approval of these principles (stormy applause). At the Bandung Conference, these principles were extended to ten principles and included in a declaration on world peace and cooperation. In this way, more than thirty countries have accepted these principles. I am convinced that if these principles of international conduct are accepted and observed by all countries in the world, they will greatly help to end the fear and doubt that overshadow the world.

    The development of science and its product, technology, has changed the world in which we live, and recent scientific achievements are changing people's views of themselves and the world.

    Even the concepts of time and space have changed, and a vast world is unfolding, asking us to explore the mysteries of nature and use our knowledge to improve human life. Science and technology have freed mankind from many of the burdens it has borne and have given us this new vision and enormous power. If wisdom guides our actions, then this power can be used for the benefit of all mankind, but if this world is mad or foolish, it can destroy itself when great progress and victory are almost within reach.

    Therefore, if our world is to progress, or indeed even survive, the issue of peace becomes of paramount importance. We believe that peace is not merely the absence of war, but a positive and affirmative attitude towards international relations, first promoting the easing of current tensions and efforts to resolve our problems through consultation, and then promoting increasing cooperation in all aspects of international relations. Cultural and scientific contacts can be increased, just as trade and the communication of ideas and the exchange of experiences and information can be increased. We should strive to eliminate all barriers and obstacles that hinder the development of our minds, as well as anything that hinders international cooperation. As long as there is no mutual interference and no forced attempts to dominate each other, there is no reason why countries with different political, social, or economic systems cannot cooperate in this way.

    Wherever I have been in the Soviet Union, I have found a love for peace.

    I believe that the vast majority of people in every country are eager for peace, but fear of others often clouds their reason and makes them act in different ways. We must eradicate this fear and hatred and try to cultivate an atmosphere of peace. Peace cannot be produced from war or the threat of war or continuous military build-up.

    In India, we have always been committed to the cause of peace, and even in our struggle, we have always strived to adopt peaceful methods. Peace is essential for our own progress and for the causes we cherish. Therefore, we will do our utmost to strive for peace and cooperate with other countries in this extremely important work.

    I would like to congratulate the Soviet government for several steps it has taken in recent months that have eased world tensions and contributed to the cause of peace (stormy applause). I particularly believe that the Soviet Union's recent proposals on disarmament will promote progress towards resolving this difficult issue. Disarmament is necessary if fear is to be eliminated and peace is to be guaranteed. We are planning the material and cultural progress of our own countries. Let us also plan for the peaceful cooperation of different countries for the common good and the elimination war.

    Some countries conclude treaties and alliances, often because they are afraid of some other country or countries. We should come together because we like each other and want to cooperate, not because we hate others and want to hurt them (applause).

    As I speak to you, the United Nations is holding a special meeting in San Francisco to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The United Nations is based on a charter written in lofty words for the purpose of peaceful cooperation. The hopes that the peoples of the world have placed in this world organization have not been fully realized, and many things have happened that are contrary to the ideals of the charter. I sincerely hope that these hopes will be realized in the new decade of the United Nations that is now beginning (applause and prolonged applause). However, if certain countries continue to be kept outside the scope of the United Nations, the United Nations cannot represent the people of all countries in the world. In particular, we have long felt that the practice of the United Nations not recognizing the great People's Republic of China is not only an anomaly and does not conform to the spirit of the charter, but is also a threat to promoting peace and resolving world problems (applause and prolonged applause).

    One of the most important issues today is the issue of the Far East, and this issue cannot be resolved without the goodwill and cooperation of the People's Republic of China.

    I am confident that we will soon see the People's Republic of China obtain its legitimate place in the United Nations (thunderous applause), and that attempts to resolve the issues in the Far East will become increasingly successful.

    We live in a vibrant and evolving world that is moving towards new discoveries and new victories, where mankind possesses ever greater power.

    We hope that this power will be controlled and mastered by wisdom and tolerance, and that every country will contribute to the common good.

    I am deeply impressed by the Soviet Union's tremendous achievements. I see the changes that have taken place in this vast land due to the diligence of the people and the great impetus that drives them to improve their conditions. I appreciate the music and dance and the wonderful ballet that I have seen. I am most impressed by the great care that the state and the people show for the children and the younger generation of this great country.

    Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to thank you again, thank your government and your people. Thank you for your spirit of friendship and generous hospitality. The people of India wish you well and look forward to cooperating with you in many areas in promoting the interests of our respective countries and the greater cause of mankind (stormy applause).

    Long live the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of our two countries and other countries of the world for the benefit of mankind! (stormy applause)

### 尼赫鲁在莫斯科群众大会上的演说

    尼赫鲁在莫斯科群众大会上的演说
    尊敬的苏联部长会议主席先生，莫斯科苏维埃主席先生，亲爱的朋友们！
    请原谅我不能用你们本国的语言——俄语向你们演说。因此你们必须听翻译。
    两星期以前我们来到苏联，不久我们就要离开这个伟大的国家。在这个时期中，我们旅行了约一万三千公里，访问了许多有名的城市，看到了许多动人的事物。但是最令人感动的是，我们在各地所受到的欢迎和人民倾注在我们身上的热情。我们无限地感谢这样的情感和热诚的招待，我简直难以用语言表达我对苏联人民的感谢（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）。但是，我仍愿意向您，部长会议主席先生，向你们的政府，你们的人民表示我们的感激，并且我请求你们把我们这个深刻情感的表示转达给这样款待我们的苏联人民（掌声）。
    我们是到这里来向这里伟大国家的人民转达印度人民的敬意和祝贺的（经久不息的掌声）。我们满载着你们对我们的国家和人民的热情和祝愿回去
  （经久不息的掌声）。
    我们并不是作为陌生人到这里来的，因为我们当中很多人一直怀着深刻的兴趣注视着苏联所发生的巨大变化和发展。
    差不多就在你们在伟大的列宁领导下实行你们的十月革命的同时，我们也在印度开始了一个争取自由的斗争的新阶段。我们的人民从事这个斗争有许多年之久，并且勇敢地坚韧地对待沉重的镇压。虽然我们在甘地的领导下走着一条不同的斗争道路，我们还是敬佩列宁，并受到他的榜样影响（经久不息的掌声）。尽管我们在方法上有所不同，但在我们的人民当中从来没有对苏联人民不友好的感情。我们对于你们国家的某些发展不大了解，正如你们可能对于我们所做的事也不大了解一样。我们愿苏联在它正在实行的伟大和新奇的实验中顺利，并愿在可能的地方向它学习。
    我们两国的背景是不同的：它们的地理、历史、传统、文化以及它们所处的环境都不同。
    我们认为，一个国家支配另外一个国家是不好的，因此，在我们为争取我们自己的自由而进行斗争的时候，我们对在外国或专制统治下受苦的其他国家争取解放的努力表示同情。每个国家和人民都受到他们自己的历史以及他们经历过的经验的限制，因此都具有某种特性。在外国统治下，或是外面把某种东西强加在他们身上，他们就不能进步。只有当实行了自力更生，建立了自己的力量，并保持着自己的完整的时候，他们才能成长。我们大家都必须向别人学习，而且不能使自己孤立起来，但是如果这种学习是强制性的，那就不可能收到效果。
    我们信仰民主、平等和特权的消除，我们已经为自己规定了用和平的方法在我们国家中建立社会主义类型的社会的目标（暴风雨般的掌声）。不论那种类型的社会主义或是民主，它必须使人人都能够得到知识和平等的机会。正是由于承认每一个国家都有决定自己命运的权利，印度政府和中国人民政府已经同意以五项原则来指导相互间的关系。这五项原则是：互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处。后来缅甸和南斯拉夫接受了这些原则，苏联政府也表示赞成这些原则（暴风雨般的掌声）。在万隆会议上，这些原则被引伸为十项原则，并包含在一个关于世界和平和合作的宣言中。这样，已经有三十多个国家接受了这些原则。我确信，这些国际行为的原则如果为全世界所有国家接受和遵守，将大大有助于终止给全世界蒙上阴影的恐惧和疑虑。
    科学和它的产物技术的发展已经改变了我们生活中的世界，最近的科学成就正在改变人们对自己和对世界的看法。
    连时间和空间的概念也改变了，广阔的天地展开着，要我们去探索自然的秘奥和运用我们的知识来改善人类的生活。科学和技术已经把人类从他们所承受的许多重担下解放出来，并且给予了我们这种新的远景和巨大的力量。如果智慧支配着我们的行动的话，那末这种力量可以用来为全人类造福，而如果这个世界是疯狂或愚蠢的话，这个世界就能够在巨大的进展和胜利几乎垂手可得的时候毁灭自身。
    因此，如果我们这个世界要获得进展，或的确甚至要生存下去的话，和平问题变成具有头等重要意义。我们认为，和平不仅仅是没有战争，而且是用一种积极的和肯定的态度处理国际关系，首先促成目前紧张局势的缓和和用协商方法解决我们问题的努力，然后促成国际间各方面的日益增长的合作。文化方面的和科学方面的接触可以增加，就像贸易和思想的沟通以及经验和消息的交流可以增加
  一样。我们应当努力消除妨碍我们心智发展的一切壁垒和障碍，以及妨碍国际合作的东西。只要不互相干涉和不强行企图支配对方，具有不同的政治、社会或经济制度的国家之间是没有理由不能这样合作的。
    在苏联我不论到什么地方都发现有一种对和平的热爱。
    我相信每个国家的极大多数人民都是渴望和平的，但是对其他的人的恐惧常常使他们的理智蒙上暗影，并使他们以不同的方式行事。我们必须革除这种恐惧和仇恨，设法培养和平气氛。从战争或战争的威胁或继续不断的备战活动中，是产生不出和平来的。
    在印度，我们一直致力于和平事业，甚至在我们的斗争中，我们也一直努力采取和平的方法。对于我们自己的进步以及为我们所珍视的事业来说，和平是必不可少的。因此，我们将尽我们的最大努力争取和平，并在这种极为重要的工作中同其他国家合作。
    我愿意为了苏联政府最近几个月来所采取的已经缓和了世界紧张局势并且对和平事业有贡献的好些步骤向苏联政府致贺（暴风雨般的掌声）。我特别相信苏联最近关于裁减军备的建议将促使这个困难问题的解决获得进展。如果要消除恐惧和保证和平，裁减军备是必要的。我们策划着我们各自国家的物质和文化的进步。让我们也来策划不同国家为了共同的好处和消除战争而和平地合作。
    一些国家缔结条约和同盟，常常是由于害怕其他某个国家或某些国家。我们聚在一起应该是由于我们彼此喜欢和希望进行合作，而不是由于我们厌恶他人和希望伤害他人（掌声）。
    在我向你们讲话的时候，联合国正在旧金山举行特别会议，庆祝联合国成立十周年纪念。联合国是以一个用崇高的字眼写成的、以和平合作为目的的宪章为基础的。世界各国人民对这个世界组织所怀抱的希望没有完全得到实现，而且发生了许多违背宪章的理想的事情。我衷心地希望在现在开始的联合国的新的十年中这些希望将能得到实现（掌声经久不息）。但是，如果某些国家继续被阻留在联合国范围以外，联合国就不能代表世界上所有国家的人民。特别是，我们早就感到：联合国不承认伟大的中华人民共和国的做法，不仅是一种反常的现象和不符合宪章的精神，而且也是对促进和平和解决世界问题的一种威胁（掌声经久不息）。
    今天最重要的问题之一就是远东问题，而这个问题如果没有中华人民共和国的善意和合作是不能解决的。
    我确信我们不久就会看到中华人民共和国取得它在联合国中的合法地位（掌声如雷），设法解决远东问题的尝试也将得到愈来愈大的成功。
    我们生活在一个生气勃勃、不断发展的世界中，它正走向新的发现和新的胜利，在那里人类拥有愈来愈大的力量。
    我们希望这种力量将为智慧和容忍精神所控制和掌握，每一个国家都将为共同的利益作出贡献。
    苏联的巨大成就给我深刻的印象。我看到这片辽阔的国土由于人民的勤劳和驱使他们改善自己的条件的伟大推动力而发生的变化。我赞赏我所看到的音乐和舞蹈和绝妙的巴蕾舞。给我印象最深的是国家和人民对这个伟大国家的孩子们和年轻的一代的巨大关怀。
    总理先生，我想再次谢谢你，谢谢贵国政府和贵国人民。感谢他们的友好精神和慷慨的招待。印度人民祝你们好，并且期望在促进我们各自国家的利益以及人类更大的事业的共同努力的许多方面同你们合作（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    我们两国人民和世界其他国家之间为人类利益而建立的友谊和合作万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
