    Take Action to Thoroughly Smash the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique
    Chen Qiyou
    The thorough exposure of the Hu Feng anti-Party, counter-revolutionary, and anti-people reactionary clique, and the resolute struggle against it, is not only a victory on our country's revolutionary literary and art front but also a major victory in our country's political struggle during the transition period.
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, composed of a group of Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary military officers, Trotskyites, revolutionary traitors, and turncoats, has for twenty years been playing a despicable two-faced trick, infiltrating the revolutionary ranks in the guise of Marxism-Leninism, to carry out their consistent counter-revolutionary activities. Ostensibly waving the banner of literary and artistic theoretical debates, they were actually plotting to organize their counter-revolutionary clique and expand their counter-revolutionary base; ostensibly supporting the Chinese Communist Party, they were actually opposing the Chinese Communist Party; ostensibly supporting the revolution, they were actually opposing the revolution.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, especially after Chiang Kai-shek openly colluded with the Japanese invading army and attacked the New Fourth Army, one of the main forces in the people's Anti-Japanese War, the people of the whole country expressed unparalleled indignation at Chiang Kai-shek's crime. When the Chinese Communist Party's organization in Chongqing was waging a difficult struggle against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Hu Feng and his followers not only did not stand around the Communist Party, accept the Party's leadership, and exert some strength on the literary and art front, but also colluded with the Kuomintang secret service newspaper, attacking the Party with open and hidden weapons. While superficially contacting some working comrades of the Party, they turned around to sabotage the Party and slander the comrades within the Party who were engaged in literary and artistic work. In addition, they also published fallacies, even denouncing Mr. Wen Yiduo, who gave his precious life for the cause of democracy, as a "speculator," attempting to slander and obstruct intellectuals from moving towards progress and aligning with the Chinese Communist Party. In short, at the most acute juncture of the revolutionary struggle, Hu Feng and his followers always tried every means to sabotage the revolutionary cause.
    After liberation, this group of counter-revolutionary elements continued their counter-revolutionary activities even more rampantly and insidiously. They infiltrated some of our government organs, some educational organs, some cultural publishing organs and newspapers, some economic organs, and the leading organs of some mass organizations such as trade unions and the Communist Youth League. Some even deceived their way into fairly important positions, striving to expand their counter-revolutionary base in all aspects to intensify their criminal acts of sabotaging the revolution and harming the people. They also tried every possible means to infiltrate the Communist Party, steal Party documents, inquire about Party information, and engage in various counter-revolutionary activities in coordination with each other, frantically hating the people's democratic dictatorship and everything in the new society. They constantly secretly discussed and formulated counter-revolutionary strategies and plans, launching a frantic attack on the Party, the revolution, and the people. After their crimes were exposed, they even tried to defend their position and preserve their "strength" to await the opportunity. These facts show that the Hu Feng clique is a thorough and complete counter-revolutionary clique, and this group of counter-revolutionary elements is sworn to be enemies of the Chinese people. We are extremely indignant and cannot tolerate these ringleaders and their heinous crimes any longer.
    We must take action to thoroughly investigate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and resolutely wage a tenacious and unremitting struggle against them, wiping them out cleanly and completely. We must also earnestly heighten our vigilance, always and everywhere prevent the enemy's conspiracies, so as to ensure the rapid progress of the revolutionary cause.

    行动起来，彻底粉碎胡风反革命集团
    陈其尤
    对胡风反党、反革命、反人民的反动集团的彻底揭露，并对它展开坚决的斗争，不仅是我国革命文艺战线上的胜利，更是我国在过渡时期政治斗争中的重大胜利。
    由一伙国民党特务，反动军官，托洛茨基分子，革命叛徒，自首变节分子为骨干组成的胡风反革命集团，二十年来，一直耍着卑鄙的两面派手法，披着马克思、列宁主义的外衣混进革命队伍里，来进行他们一贯的反革命活动。表面上摇着进行文艺理论论战的幌子，实际上进行组织其反革命集团扩大其反革命阵地的阴谋；表面上拥护中国共产党，实际上反对中国共产党；表面上拥护革命，实际上反对革命。
    在抗日战争时期，特别是在蒋介石公开同日本侵略军勾结，对人民抗日战争中的主力部队之一的新四军进行进攻以后，全国人民对蒋介石这一罪行表示无比愤恨。当中国共产党在重庆的组织正对国民党反动统治进行艰巨斗争的时候，胡风及其追随者，不仅没有站在共产党的周围，接受党的领导，来在文艺战线上发挥一些力量，却和国民党特务机关报，狼狈为奸，明枪暗箭，向党进攻，表面上和党的一些工作同志们接触，转过头来，破坏党，污蔑党内从事文艺工作的同志们；此外还发表谬论，甚至把为民主事业而付出宝贵生命的闻一多先生，也骂为是“投机”，企图以此来污蔑和阻挠知识分子走向进步和靠拢中国共产党。总之，在革命斗争最尖锐的关头，胡风及胡风分子，总是想尽方法来破坏革命事业。
    解放后，这批反革命分子，更猖狂地同时也更阴险地继续进行其反革命活动，分头混进我们的某些政府机关，某些教育机关，某些文化出版机关和报馆，某些经济机关，以及某些工会、青年团等群众团体的领导机关，有的还骗到了相当重要的职务，力图从各方面扩大其反革命阵地，来加紧他们破坏革命，祸害人民的罪恶勾当。他们还千方百计打入共产党内，窃取党内文件，探听党内情况，里应外合地从事各种反革命活动，疯狂地仇恨人民民主专政和新社会的一切，不断地秘密商议，制定反革命策略和计划，向党，向革命，向人民猖狂进攻。当其罪行被揭发以后，还要以守为攻，保存“实力”，以待时机。这些事实说明，胡风集团是个彻头彻尾的反革命集团，这批反革命分子，是誓死与中国人民为敌的。对这批罪魁祸首，对这些滔天罪行，我们愤恨已极，忍无可忍。
    我们必须行动起来，彻查胡风反革命集团及一切暗藏的反革命分子，坚决向他们作顽强不懈的斗争，将他们干净彻底一网打尽。更要认真提高警惕，随时随地防范着敌人的阴谋活动，以保障革命事业的高速进展。
