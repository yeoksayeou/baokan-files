Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Elements
Zhou Jianren

I read with extreme indignation the third batch of materials concerning the Hu Feng anti-Party, anti-people, counter-revolutionary group published in the "People's Daily." This gang of vermin of the Hu Feng group will not "fight alone." How exactly did they rely on the forces of the reactionary class? Who are their masters? The third batch of materials answers this question. It turns out that Hu Feng and his loyal followers have been faithful running dogs of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries for quite some time. It turns out that the basic backbone of the Hu Feng group is composed of Kuomintang secret agents, revolutionary traitors, and all kinds of the most vile and dirty social scum. These reactionary elements, cloaked in progressive garb, clamored madly as early as 1946, saying that "the main force can be broken in three months, and the country can be cleared in a year." Their vicious slander against the Party and the people, and their embarrassment and panic in the face of the People's Liberation Army's great advance, what difference is there between them and public enemies like Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Lifu? No wonder these figures have such deep hatred for the Party and the people, no wonder they cursed all progressive writers as "maggots," smeared Mr. Wen Yiduo as "opportunistic," commemorating Lu Xun as if suffering a "disaster," no wonder they "hate everyone!" What else can be expected from the executioners from "Sino-American Cooperative Organization"?

The thorough exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is another major victory for the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party in their struggle against the enemy. This victory not only exposed a counter-revolutionary group that had been hiding in the people's camp for a long time and stopped their criminal activities, but also gave the people valuable experience and lessons. This event once again proves that no dying class will automatically withdraw from the stage of history. They are trying every means to restore themselves. After the victory of the revolution, it is impossible to carry out counter-revolutionary activities openly, so the enemy must use all kinds of despicable two-faced methods, deceive the people, infiltrate the various fortresses of the revolutionary camp, hide themselves, and carry out sabotage from within. The Hu Feng group provides us with a typical example. First, they infiltrated the revolutionary headquarters – the great Communist Party of China; second, they wanted to infiltrate various democratic parties, armies, institutions, schools, etc., everywhere searching for their "comrades," establishing "strongholds," and "penetrating" into our "livers." They have a set of precise counter-revolutionary tactics, such as not firing "before the position is strong," "burying their heads in work, getting a good mass base," and then "finding a large target" to attack. Look, how insidious and vicious the enemy is! It is certain that there must be other counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated our ranks and have not been discovered. Therefore, everyone must learn a profound lesson from the Hu Feng incident. As a member of a democratic party, our members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy must better study Marxism-Leninism, improve our political consciousness and strengthen our political sense of smell, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, and, under the leadership of the Communist Party, fight to eliminate the Hu Feng group and all other counter-revolutionary elements mixed in our ranks.

We tell all members of the Hu Feng group: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the power of the people is infinitely powerful, your "cause" has completely failed, and you have no "future"! Only by surrendering to the people, confessing thoroughly, and exposing your own and others' crimes can you have a chance to be a new person.

Resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary elements of the Hu Feng group, and severely punish all stubborn counter-revolutionary elements!

    坚决镇压反革命分子
    周建人
    我以极愤慨的心情看了“人民日报”公布的关于胡风反党、反人民、反革命集团的第三批材料。胡风集团这一群蟊贼是不会“孤军作战”的，他们究竟如何依靠反动阶级力量？他们的主子是谁？第三批材料答复了这个问题。原来胡风及其忠实党羽相当长的时期以来就是帝国主义、国民党反动派的忠实走狗。原来胡风集团的基本骨干就是由国民党特务、革命叛徒以及托洛茨基分子等形形色色最卑鄙、最肮脏的社会渣滓所组成的。这些披着进步外衣的反动分子，早在一九四六年就疯狂地叫嚣着“三个月可以击破主力，一年肃清”。他们对党和人民作凶恶的污蔑，以及他们在人民解放军大进军面前所感到的狼狈和恐慌的情况，同蒋介石、陈立夫等人民公敌有什么区别？难怪这批人物对党对人民有着那样的深仇大恨，难怪他们诅咒所有的进步作家为“蛆虫”，污蔑闻一多先生为“投机”，纪念鲁迅如同受到“灾难”，难怪他们“恨一切人”！对于来自“中美合作所”的刽子手们，还能期待什么别的东西？
    胡风反革命集团的被彻底揭露，是中国人民在党的领导下对敌斗争所取得的又一重大胜利。这一胜利不但揭露了一个长期隐蔽在人民阵营中的反革命集团，制止了他们的罪恶活动，而且给了人民以宝贵的经验和教训。这一事件再一次证明：任何垂死的阶级都不会自动地退出历史舞台的。他们正在千方百计地企图复辟。革命胜利之后，公开地进行反革命活动是不可能了，敌人就必然使用各种卑鄙的两面手段，欺骗人民，打入革命阵营的各个堡垒，隐蔽起来，从内部进行破坏。胡风集团给我们提供了一个典型的例子。他们首先打入革命的司令部——伟大的中国共产党内去，其次，他们要打入各民主党派、军队、机关、学校等等，到处搜罗他们的“同志”，建立“据点”，“深入”我们的“肝脏里面”。他们有着“在阵地未强固前”不放枪，“埋头工作，把群众基础弄好”然后再“找大的对象”加以攻击等等一套精密的反革命策略。看，敌人是如何的阴险和狠毒！可以肯定，一定还有其他的反革命分子打入我们的队伍而未被发现。因此，每一个人都必须从胡风事件吸取深刻的教训。我以一个民主党派的成员来说，我们中国民主促进会的全体会员们一定要更好地学习马克思列宁主义，提高政治觉悟和加强政治嗅觉，百倍地提高警惕，在共产党的领导下为肃清胡风集团及其他一切混在我们队伍里的反革命分子而斗争。
    我们告诉所有胡风集团分子：在中国共产党的领导下，人民的力量是无比强大的，你们的“事业”是彻底失败了，你们没有什么“未来”！只有向人民投降，彻底坦白，揭发自己和别人的罪行，才有重新作人的机会。
    坚决镇压胡风集团的反革命分子，严厉惩处一切顽固不悟的反革命分子！
