Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 15th: Indian newspapers are paying attention to the work of the Hong Kong authorities in investigating the perpetrators of the "Kashmir Princess" plane crash.

　　The "Hindustan Times" editorial on the 14th commented on the Hong Kong authorities' reward for the arrest of the perpetrators who destroyed the Indian plane, saying, "This huge reward has produced disappointing results." The editorial said that the unfortunate plane crash had caused serious diplomatic repercussions. "Indeed, only when the criminals are arrested and brought to justice and the entire conspiracy is revealed will the tensions caused by this mass murder be eased." The editorial also said, "The honor of Britain depends on whether the most vicious political murder in history can be thoroughly investigated."

　　The "Hindustan Standard" also published an editorial saying that the Hong Kong authorities "appear not to have provided much help in tracking down the criminals." The editorial said: "Political crimes of such magnitude and international significance are never committed by ordinary individuals. As long as Hong Kong continues to be a center of international conspiracy, the authorities there cannot hope to cut off the spies there."

　　The editorial also said, "This case cannot be treated as an ordinary crime. This is not a case of individual criminals seeking refuge in another country. Therefore, if the Kuomintang government attempts to create obstacles to hinder the proper investigation of this case, appropriate political action must be taken at the international level to ensure that political banditry is not used as a tool of the Cold War."

    印度报纸重视香港当局追查飞机事件的凶手
    新华社新德里十五日电　印度报纸重视香港当局追查破坏“克什米尔公主号”飞机的凶手的工作。
      “印度斯坦时报”十四日的社论中评论香港当局悬赏缉拿破坏印度飞机的凶手说，“这一巨额悬赏产生了令人失望的结果。”社论说，飞机失事的不幸事件在外交上引起了严重的反应。“的确，只有当罪犯被逮捕归案，全部阴谋被查明以后，由于这次集体谋杀所引起的紧张气氛才会得到缓和。”社论又说，“能否把历史上最恶毒的一次政治谋杀查个水落石出，关系到英国的荣誉。”
    “印度斯坦旗报”也发表社论说，香港当局
  “看来在追查罪犯方面是没有提供很多帮助的。”社论说：“像这样重大和有国际意义的政治罪行决不会是普通的个人所干的。只要香港继续成为国际阴谋的中心，那里的当局就不可能希望断绝那里的特务。”
    社论又说，“这个案件不能被当作普通的罪行来处理。这并不是个人罪犯在另一国家寻求避难所的案件。因此，如果国民党政府设法制造障碍来阻挠对这个案件进行正当的调查，那就必须在国际一级采取适当的政治行动来保证不让政治上的匪徒行为被用来作为冷战的手段。”
