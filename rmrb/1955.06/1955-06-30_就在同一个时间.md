At The Same Time
Shao Yanxiang

I ask the young lovers,
Do you know: at the very same time,
You just mailed a letter full of light and passion,
Agreeing to meet next Sunday;
While Hu Feng's wife is throwing a batch of black letters
Into the mailbox, hurrying into the alley,
Xie Tao is rushing into the city from outside,
Running to a secret rendezvous point.
I ask the exploration team member, you are carrying newly mined samples
Rushing from the remote mountains to Beijing,
Do you know: Lu Dian is also squeezing onto the same train,
He is going to receive instructions from Hu Feng.
I ask the work zone director, you are opening the construction blueprints,
Looking, thinking, stroking the dots and lines,
Do you know: a volume of Party documents
Has been secretly delivered to Ouyang Zhuang's hand.
I ask the students, you walk into the library in the evening,
Spreading out the day's notes under the lamp,
Do you know: in a secret room
Who is under the lamp, at this same time?
Lü Yuan, Xu Fang, one article for you, one for him,
Secretly copying Party documents for Hu Feng;
At this time, under the lamp in another secret room,
A list of developing counter-revolutionary organizations is being approved.
At the same time, on the distant grasslands,
The aerial magnetic survey plane has just returned,
Beside the open-hearth furnace that produced the first heat of boiling steel,
Everyone chats and laughs, wiping the sweat from their faces;
Do you know: Hu Feng is holding a secret meeting,
One moment with a grimace, the next moment jumping with rage,
Lowering his voice to praise, pounding his chest and stamping his feet to scold,
Arranging: to infiltrate the Party, infiltrate the army, infiltrate cultural organizations
And economic institutions!
Mothers: how sweetly your children sleep,
Don't let him have nightmares, this is your wish,
Here, chubby little hands, deep dimples;
There, Hu Feng is grinding his teeth, sharpening his sword!
Hu Feng triumphantly announces: "The time has begun!"
But we did not fall into a deep sleep:
"Shut up! It's over—your time!"
...On our vast land,
There are millions upon millions of patriotic people!
But there will never be just one Hu Feng, one A Long...
Nor will there be only one Hu Feng clique.
Dear people, be vigilant,
Purge all counter-revolutionaries!
No matter if they are black-skinned and black-hearted, red-skinned and white-hearted, gloomy-faced or sunny-faced,
No matter if they flee to the ends of the earth,
Or burrow into the middle of our fortress!

    就在同一个时间
    邵燕祥
    我问年轻的情人们，
    你们可知道：就在同一个时间，
    你们刚寄出一封充满光明和热情的信，
    相约在下一个星期天见面；
    而胡风的老婆正把一批黑信
    丢进邮筒，匆匆拐进了小胡同，
    谢韬正从城外赶进城来，
    跑到秘密碰头的地点。
    我问勘探队员，你带着新采的矿样
    从遥远的山野奔向北京，
    你可知道：芦甸也挤上同一列车，
    他是去领取胡风的指令。
    我问工区主任，你正打开施工的图纸，
    看着、想着，抚摸着点点线线，
    你可知道：一卷党内的文件
    已经暗地里送到欧阳庄的手边。
    我问同学们，傍晚你们走进图书馆，
    在灯下摊开一天的笔记，
    你们可知道：有一间密室里
    灯下是谁，在这同一个时间？
    绿原，徐放，你一篇，他一篇，
    替胡风偷抄党内文件；
    这时在另一间密室的灯下，
    正在通过发展反革命组织的名单。
    在同一个时间，远方的草原上，
    航空磁测的飞机刚刚归来，
    在炼出第一炉沸腾钢的炼钢炉旁，
    大家谈笑着擦去满脸的汗；
    你们可知道：胡风正召开秘密会议，
    一忽儿满脸狞笑，一忽儿暴跳如雷，
    压低嗓门表扬，搥胸顿脚痛骂，
    布置着：打进党，打进军队，打进文化团体
    和经济机关！
    母亲们：你们的孩子睡得多甜，
    别让他作恶梦，这是你们的心愿，
    这里，肥胖的小手，深深的酒涡；
    那里，胡风在磨着牙齿磨着剑！
    胡风得意地宣布：“时间开始了！”
    但是我们并没有沉睡不醒：
    “住嘴！结束了——你们的时间！”
    ……在我们广阔的国土上，
    爱国的人民千千万万！
    但是也决不只有一个胡风，一个阿垅……
    也决不只有一个胡风集团。
    亲爱的人们，提高警惕，
    肃清一切反革命分子！
    不管他黑皮黑心，红皮白心，阴脸阳脸，
    不管他潜逃到天边地角，
    还是钻到了我们的堡垒中间！
