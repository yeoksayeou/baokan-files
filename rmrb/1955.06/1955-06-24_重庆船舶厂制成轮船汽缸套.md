Chongqing Shipyard has successfully manufactured marine cylinder liners.
    The marine cylinder liners successfully trial-produced by the workers of Chongqing Shipbuilding & Repair Plant are performing well, strongly supporting the Yangtze River shipping work.

    In 1954, the workers of Chongqing Shipbuilding & Repair Plant began trial-producing marine cylinder liners. The new product had high technical requirements and a complex casting structure, but the workers and technicians jointly overcame various difficulties in technology, materials, and equipment. They conducted 69 tests on the performance of casting materials and more than ten trial productions of castings. After more than five months of repeated research and manufacturing, they finally succeeded. Practical use has proven that the performance of the domestically produced cylinder liners exceeds that of imported goods. According to preliminary calculations, the cost is only about one-seventh of the price of imported goods.

    Cylinder liners are essential accessories for most ships sailing on the Yangtze River. In the past, China could not manufacture them and relied entirely on imports. Due to the lack of these accessories, some ships were unable to sail because the cylinder liners were damaged and could not be replaced.

    Currently, in addition to mass-producing cylinder liners, Chongqing Shipbuilding & Repair Plant is actively trial-producing several other shipping materials.

    重庆船舶厂制成轮船汽缸套
    重庆船舶修造厂的职工们试制成功的轮船汽缸套使用情况很好，有力地支援了长江航运工作。
    一九五四年重庆船舶修造厂的职工们开始试制轮船汽缸套。新产品的技术要求较高，铸件结构复杂，但工人、技术人员们共同克服了技术、材料、设备等方面的种种困难，进行了六十九次关于铸造材料性能的试验和十几次铸件试制，经过五个多月的反复研究制造，终于成功了。根据实际使用结果证明，自制的汽缸套性能超过进口货；据初步计算，成本只相当于进口货价格的七分之一左右。
    汽缸套是在长江航行的多数轮船所必需的重要配件，过去我国不能制造，全靠进口。因为这种配件的缺乏，有的船也就因为汽缸套损坏了得不到更换而不能航行。
    目前，重庆船舶修造厂除了进行汽缸套的大批生产外，正在积极试制另外几种航运器材。
