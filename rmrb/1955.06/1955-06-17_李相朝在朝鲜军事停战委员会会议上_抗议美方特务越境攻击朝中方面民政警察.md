Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 16th. According to the Korean Central News Agency's Kaesong dispatch: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 14th, Li Sang-cho, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, strongly protested against the US side for dispatching “CIC” ("Counter Intelligence Corps") special agent Hong Seong-gak (transliteration) and about ten other armed special agents on June 2nd to sneak into the area under the jurisdiction of the Korean-Chinese side to attack Korean-Chinese civil police.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho enumerated the personal and material evidence obtained during the joint investigation at the scene, refuting the US Chief Commissioner Parks' distortion of the facts in his letter of June 9th. Parks described the incident as if US personnel had not crossed the Military Demarcation Line into the Korean-Chinese side's area at all, and that those crossing the border, as "civil police," had not taken any hostile actions.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho pointed out that the US's action in violation of the Armistice Agreement was another hostile action taken by the US despite repeated requests from the Korean-Chinese side in the past. He also demanded that the US severely punish the instigators and relevant personnel involved in this incident, and take measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    Regarding the US's proposal for a joint measurement of the incident site and the addition of signs on the Military Demarcation Line, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho said that although our side does not consider this necessary, our side agrees to this proposal in order to prevent the US from having any excuse to violate the Armistice Agreement and then try to cover it up.

    李相朝在朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上
    抗议美方特务越境攻击朝中方面民政警察
    新华社平壤十六日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将十四日在军事停战委员会会议上，强硬抗议美方在六月二日派遣“CIC”（“反间谍队”）特务洪成觉（译音）和另外十名左右武装特务潜入在朝中方面管辖下的地区攻击朝中方面民政警察。
    李相朝中将列举在现场进行联合调查时所得到的人证、物证，反驳了美方首席委员帕克斯少将在他的六月九日信中的歪曲事实的说法。帕克斯在信中把这件事说成好像美方人员根本没有越过军事分界线侵入朝中方面地区，那些越境的人员作为“民政警察”也没有采取什么敌对行动。
    李相朝中将指出，美方这种违反停战协定的行动是美方不顾朝中方面过去一再提出的要求而采取的又一次敌对行动。他并要求美方严惩这次事件的教唆者和有关人员，并且采取措施防止以后发生类似的事件。
    关于美方要求联合测量出事地点和增设军事分界线上的标志的建议，李相朝中将说，虽然我方认为这并不是必要的，但是我方同意这个建议，以免使美方得到任何借口来违反停战协定然后再加以掩饰。
