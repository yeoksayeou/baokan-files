Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 27th (TASS): Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited U.S. Secretary of State Dulles in San Francisco on June 25th and issued a statement regarding the incident of American military aircraft intruding into Soviet territory and a conflict involving Soviet aircraft.

The statement said that, according to reports from Soviet authorities, on June 23rd of this year, at 12:57 Moscow time (7:57 in Blagoveshchensk time), a "Neptune" military aircraft with U.S. Air Force markings intruded into Soviet territory in the Bering Strait region east of Cape Chaplin (Chukotka).

When Soviet fighter planes approached this aircraft to inform it that it had entered Soviet territory and suggest it immediately leave Soviet airspace, the American and Soviet aircraft began firing at each other.

The statement continued, the Soviet government has previously called the attention of the American government to the need for the American military command to take measures to preclude the possibility of the recurrence of unpleasant incidents arising from the repeated violations of the Soviet border by American military aircraft in the past. The fact that an American aircraft has once again violated the Soviet border proves that the American authorities have not taken the necessary measures to prevent similar unpleasant incidents. At the same time, the aforementioned Soviet authorities reported that the encounter of the aircraft occurred in conditions of heavy clouds and loss of observation direction. In this case, it cannot be denied that the incident may have been the result of inaccurate determination of the position of the aircraft by both sides when approaching. Nor can it be denied that the incident of the American aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace may have been the result of the actions of certain representatives in the U.S. military command who obviously had no intention of preventing such incidents. Regardless of which of these two situations is the cause of this incident, the Soviet military command has strict orders to avoid taking any action outside the Soviet border when carrying out the task of defending the Soviet border. This order was specifically issued at the time of the American aircraft incident on June 23rd, and the Soviet government hopes that the American government will issue strict orders to its military command to prevent American military aircraft from intruding into Soviet territory.

The statement concluded that the Soviet government expresses its regret over the incident that has occurred.

Given the circumstances under which the incident of this American military aircraft occurred, which do not preclude the possibility of errors on one side or the other, the Soviet government declares that it is willing to compensate the American side for 50 percent of the losses suffered, with the remaining 50 percent of the losses to be borne by the American side.

    就美国军用飞机侵入苏联国境和苏联飞机发生冲突事件
    莫洛托夫外长访问杜勒斯并发表声明
    新华社二十八日讯据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：苏联外交部长莫洛托夫六月二十五日在旧金山访问了美国国务卿杜勒斯，就美国军用飞机侵入苏联国境和苏联飞机发生冲突事件，发表了声明。
    声明说，根据苏联主管机关报告，今年六月二十三日莫斯科时间十二时五十七分（伯力时间七时五十七分），一架带有美国空军标记的“海王星式”军用飞机在查普林诺角（楚科特卡）以东白令海峡地区侵入苏联国境。
    当苏联的战斗机飞近这架飞机，以便告知它已飞入苏联国境并建议它立即离开苏联领空的时候，美国和苏联的飞机互相射击起来。
    声明接着说，苏联政府曾经提请美国政府注意：美国军事司令部必须采取措施，以杜绝过去由于美国军用飞机屡次侵犯苏联国境而发生的不愉快事件重新发生的可能。这次美国飞机又一次侵犯苏联国境的事实证明，美国当局没有采取必要的措施来杜绝类似的不愉快事件。同时上述苏联机关报告，飞机的相遇是在云层很厚、失去观察方向的情况下发生的。在这种情况下，不能否定这事件可能是由于双方飞机在接近时对飞机的位置确定得不准确的结果。也不能否定美国飞机侵入苏联领空的事件可能是美军司令部中某些显然无意防止这类事件的代表们的行动结果。不论这两种情况中的哪一种是造成这次事件的原因，苏军司令部有严格的命令规定，在执行苏联国境的防卫任务时，应避免在苏联国境范围以外采取任何行动。在六月二十三日美国飞机事件发生的时候曾经特别下达过这一命令，苏联政府希望：美国政府将对自己的军事司令部下达严格的命令，不让美国军用飞机侵入苏联国境。
    声明最后说，苏联政府对已经发生的事件表示遗憾。
    鉴于这架美国军用飞机的事件发生时的情况不能否定一方或另一方发生错误的可能性，苏联政府声明它愿意赔偿美国方面所受损失的百分之五十，其余百分之五十的损失应由美国方面负担。
