    The Labor of Workers
    —Notes on Yugoslav Industry
    By Fú. Mǎyēfūsījī, Soviet Union
    Recalling the impressions of my trip to Yugoslavia, I cannot help but think of the question that most concerns everyone who cares deeply about the country's development: How are the Yugoslav people building their industry? What achievements have they made in the cause of industrialization, which is urgently needed to maintain and strengthen national independence, enhance national power, and improve the material well-being of the people?

    During our stay in Yugoslavia, it was not enough time to study these issues in depth and comprehensively. However, cordial meetings with the Yugoslav people, numerous conversations with various figures, and travels within Yugoslavia enabled us to gain a relatively clear understanding of the essence of the issues.

    I remember the meeting with the workers of the Rade Končar electrical machinery factory in Zagreb, named after the Yugoslav People's Hero. This factory is one of the largest enterprises, rebuilt and equipped to the level of modern technological achievements. Before the war, this factory was a small, semi-handicraft assembly plant that only assembled small generators from the German Siemens and Schuckert companies. Now, the Rade Končar factory, built by the Yugoslav people, manufactures generators for hydroelectric power stations, powerful transformers, and engines. The output of the factory's products is also considerable.

    The following detail is worth noting: this factory began construction in 1945, immediately after the victory over the fascist aggressors. The Yugoslav people were determined to create a developed heavy industry for their motherland. The massive project of national electrification began: according to scientists' statistics, Yugoslavia has total hydropower resources with a generating capacity of over six million kilowatts, and now it is necessary to utilize this capacity.

    In 1949, the Rade Končar factory went into production. It made a significant contribution to the cause of electrification in Yugoslavia. Engineer Filip Knežević, the factory director, said that the production of generators is increasing more and more, and that next year, the Rade Končar factory alone will be able to produce as much power as the entire old Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

    At the Zagreb factory, we met with fitters, planers, and electrical technicians, ordinary people who talked about their factory and their labor. Each of them had almost experienced the years of heroic struggle against the fascist aggressors, had been tempered in the guerrillas, and served in the heroic People's Liberation Army. In the firm handshake when we parted with the workers, we clearly felt the strength of the workers' hands—hands that smashed the Hitlerite occupiers, developed Yugoslavia's national economy from the ruins, and day after day contributed to the cause of developing Yugoslav industry.

    The old Kingdom of Yugoslavia was a backward agricultural country, bound by the chains of foreign capital. The country's textile, mining, and machine-building enterprises belonged to foreign companies or were closely linked to them. Yugoslavia's natural resources were plundered and transported abroad at low prices. The fascist occupation brought great damage to Yugoslav industry, with almost all enterprises either severely damaged or completely destroyed. A heavy legacy fell upon the working people of Yugoslavia.

    After the end of the war, the Yugoslav working class devoted themselves wholeheartedly to the work of restoring the industry that had become the property of the people and further developing it. In Yugoslavia, the means of production of large and medium-sized industries and the transportation industry are publicly owned. Banks, credit institutions, and wholesale trade are controlled by the state. Previously foreign property has been nationalized. The proportion of the private sector (handicraft production and small business) in Yugoslav industry and commerce is less than ten percent.

    Between 1946 and 1954, Yugoslavia built and put into operation approximately 250 new enterprises, including 55 power stations with a total generating capacity of 420,000 kilowatts, 53 machine-building factories, 23 chemical enterprises, 7 metallurgical plants, 2 coking chemical complexes, 24 enterprises producing electrical equipment, 21 textile factories, and other factories.

    In recent years, over sixty percent of Yugoslavia's total investment has been in industry, and the investment in heavy industry has been increasing year by year.

    During our trip to Yugoslavia, we saw some new enterprises: power stations and factories built by the hands of Yugoslav workers under the leadership of Yugoslav engineers. In the mountains of Horvacia, we saw the Vinodol hydroelectric power station equipped with large-scale advanced technology. In the city of Rijeka, we saw the rebuilt (or rather, reconstructed) shipyard, which builds ships with a displacement of 10,000 tons. In Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, we visited a new heavy machinery manufacturing plant called "Litostroj," a factory that the Yugoslav working people can rightly be proud of.

    A few years ago, the outskirts of Ljubljana were still fields of maize. Now, spacious and bright factory workshops have been built here, with engines humming non-stop. This factory manufactures turbines, cranes, and other equipment for domestic industry and export. This enterprise was built according to the design of experienced architect Edo Mihevc. Concrete and reinforced concrete were widely used in the construction of the workshops. Everything was done in a masterly, economical, and convenient way. Wide asphalt roads lead to the workshops, and the factory area is being greened—near the walls of the factory buildings, tower-shaped poplars are striving upwards.

    In the suburbs of Ljubljana, the vast workers' residential area and the "Litostroj" factory grew simultaneously, with many good rows of housing built for the workers. The factory is developing, and the labor force is increasing.

    In 1939, Yugoslavia had 300,000 industrial workers. According to Yugoslav press materials, in 1954, this number had increased to more than 685,000. The majority of industrial workers (nearly 400,000) work in the light industrial sector, with a small proportion working in the heavy industrial sector.

    In addition to the "Litostroj" factory, among the large enterprises that have started operations in recent years, one can mention the Železnik machine-building factory, the Sevojno copper smelter, and other factories. In 1954 alone, ten power stations with a generating capacity of 5,000 to 20,000 kilowatts each, blast furnaces with a smelting capacity of 200,000 tons of pig iron, open-hearth furnaces, rolling mills, and two coke oven batteries in Zenica, a thin-plate rolling mill at the Smederevo metallurgical plant, open-hearth furnaces at the Sisak metallurgical plant, and a rolling mill capable of producing 60,000 tons of seamless steel pipes went into production. In the post-war period, Yugoslavia re-established industrial sectors that did not exist in the past, such as heavy machinery manufacturing, the oil extraction and refining industry, and the radio equipment industry.

    Due to the opening of new enterprises and the extensive renovation of old factories, Yugoslavia's industrial output has expanded significantly compared to pre-war levels.

    According to official data, with the 1939 industrial output level as 100, the total index of Yugoslav industrial production in 1954 had reached 208. The plan stipulates that this year's industrial production index will reach 240.

    Although Yugoslav industry did not complete the first five-year plan for many reasons, the production of Yugoslavia's most important heavy industries (except copper) has greatly increased. The comparison table from the Yugoslav statistical monthly "Index" (Issue 3, 1955), extracted from the period from 1939 to 1954, illustrates this. (In thousands of tons)

                                                        1939  　　　　1954
    Coal                              7,032  　　　13,645
    Oil                                1.1  　　　　216.3
    Pig iron                           101  　　　　356
    Steel                              235  　　　　616
    Copper                             41.6  　　　　30.3
    Lead                               10.6  　　　　66.7
    Zinc                                 5    　　　　13.6
    Electricity (in millions of kWh)
                                     1,173  　　　3,440

    Calculated per capita, industrial production in 1954 increased compared to 1939: electricity increased from 73 kWh to 199 kWh, coal from 437 kg to 790 kg, steel from 15 kg to 36 kg, paper from 2.6 kg to 3.4 kg, cotton cloth from 7 square meters to 10 square meters, and leather shoes from 0.6 pairs to 0.8 pairs.

    Due to the selfless labor of the Yugoslav working class, industry has become the most important source of Yugoslavia's national income. Industry accounts for 42.1 percent of national income, agriculture accounts for 30.3 percent, commerce and public utilities account for 7.5 percent, construction accounts for 7.3 percent, handicrafts account for 4.8 percent, and transportation accounts for 4.6 percent.

    Naturally, the development of Yugoslav industry also has its difficulties. Our Yugoslav interlocutors—experts and representatives of the press—also frankly talked about this. Some industrial sectors are almost entirely dependent on raw materials imported from foreign countries. For example, 96 percent of the cotton required by the textile industry is reliant on imports. The rubber industry is completely dependent on foreign raw materials. Yugoslavia also has to import coking coal, high-quality coal, and other raw materials.

    If one considers that, in addition to various industrial raw materials, Yugoslavia also has to import large quantities of food, especially grain (several crop failures in recent years), it is not difficult to see why Yugoslavia's trade has an unfavorable deficit; in 1953, Yugoslavia's exports were 55.8 billion dinars, while imports were 118.6 billion dinars. Yugoslavia's trade with the United States is particularly unfavorable, as the United States accounts for 9.7 percent of Yugoslavia's exports and 27.8 percent of its imports.

    Last month, the Yugoslav magazine "Economic Policy" reported that Yugoslavia had concluded trade agreements with the Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia for the first quarter of 1955, with a total trade volume of 87 million US dollars. The magazine called on Yugoslav trade organizations to be active in restoring and developing mutually beneficial commercial ties with the Soviet Union.

    In our conversations with Yugoslav workers, we were very interested in their material lives. Facts show that the material living standards of many working-class families are improving, and living conditions are gradually improving. The state takes special care of the children of working people. However, our Yugoslav friends did not hide their difficulties, for example, due to many circumstances, food prices remain high, which affects the budgets of working-class families.

    But the difficulties have not daunted the Yugoslav workers. The people who have built new factories with their own hands, the people who feel that they are the masters of the country, are filled with a firm determination to overcome these difficulties.

    I remember a worker named Stjepan Kunčević, who is the chairman of the factory workers' committee at the Rade Končar factory. Standing in front of the monument to the hero Rade Končar, he told comrades Ni. Se. Khrushchev, Ni. Ya. Bulganin, and A. I. Mikoyan, who were visiting the factory, about the selfless labor of his comrades, and he concluded:

      "We work for the happiness of our country. We have difficulties—we are solving them. There will be no life without struggle!"

    I warmly hope that the workers of the Rade Končar factory, the workers of the "Litostroj" factory, the workers of the "May 3rd" shipyard in Rijeka, and the workers of hundreds of other enterprises in Yugoslavia will achieve new successes in the development of the national economy.

    工人的劳动
    ——记南斯拉夫的工业
    苏联  弗·马耶夫斯基
    回想起在南斯拉夫旅行的印象，不由得就会想到那使每一个非常关心这个国家的发展的人所最注意的问题：南斯拉夫人民在怎样建设着自己的工业？在维护和巩固国家的民族独立、增强国家的威力以及提高人民的物质福利所迫切需要的工业化事业中，他们获得了怎样的成就？
    我们在南斯拉夫逗留的期间，对于深刻和全面地研究这些问题来说，是不够的。但是，同南斯拉夫人民的亲切会晤、同各种不同人物的多次谈话、在南斯拉夫国内的旅行，使我们能够比较清楚地认识一下问题的实质。
    我想起了同萨格勒布以南斯拉夫人民英雄拉捷·康恰尔命名的电机工厂的工人们的会见。这个工厂是以现代技术成就水平装备的、重建起来的一个最大的企业。战前这个工厂是一个小型的、半手工业的装配工厂，只装配一些德国西门子、舒其特公司的小型发电机。现在这个由南斯拉夫人民建设的拉捷·康恰尔工厂制造着水电站用的发电机、强大的变压器和发动机。工厂产品的输出数量也不少。
    下面这个细节是值得指出的：这个工厂是在一九四五年，即在战胜法西斯侵略者以后立刻开始建设的。南斯拉夫人民满怀着决心创立发达的祖国的重工业。国家电气化的巨大工程开始了：根据科学家的统计，南斯拉夫所拥有的水力资源总发电能力达六百万瓩时以上，现在就是要利用这个能力。
    一九四九年拉捷·康恰尔工厂投入生产了。它给南斯拉夫电气化事业以重大的贡献。工厂厂长菲利普·克涅热维奇工程师说，发电机的生产越来越增加了，到明年仅仅拉捷·康恰尔工厂一个厂就能够生产出等于旧日的南斯拉夫王国全国那么多的动力。
    在萨格勒布工厂我们同钳工、刨工、电机技术员会晤，这些普通人谈到他们的工厂，他们的劳动。他们之中的每一个人都几乎经历过反抗法西斯侵略者的英勇斗争的年代，都在游击队里受过锻炼和在英勇的人民解放军部队中服务过。在同工人们分别时的紧紧握手中，我们清楚地感觉到工人们的手的力量——这些手粉碎了希特勒占领者，从废墟上发展了南斯拉夫的国民经济，并且日复一日地把自己的贡献带给发展南斯拉夫工业的事业中去。
    旧日的南斯拉夫王国是一个落后的农业国家，外国资本的锁链束缚着它。国内的纺织、采矿和机器制造企业都是属于外国公司的，或者是同外国公司有密切联系的。南斯拉夫的自然富源都被盗窃了，并以低廉的价格运到国外去。法西斯分子的占领给南斯拉夫工业带来了巨大的损害，几乎所有的企业，或是遭受严重的破坏，或是彻底被毁了。落到南斯拉夫劳动人民身上的是一个沉重的遗产。
    战争结束以后，南斯拉夫的工人阶级忘我地投身于恢复已经成为人民财产的工业和进一步发展工业的工作之中。在南斯拉夫，大型和中型工业的生产工具以及运输业都是公有的。银行、贷款机构和批发贸易都掌握在国家手中。以前外国的财产都已经收归国有。南斯拉夫的工业和商业中私有部分（手工业生产和小商业）的比重不到百分之十。
      一九四六年到一九五四年间，南斯拉夫已经建成和投入生产的新企业约有二百五十个，其中有五十五个发电站，总发电能力为四十二万瓩时，有五十三个机器制造工厂，二十三个化学企业，七个冶金工厂，两个焦炭化学联合工厂，二十四个生产电气设备的企业，二十一个纺织工厂，以及其他工厂。
    最近几年，南斯拉夫全部投资额的百分之六十以上是投在工业方面的，而且重工业方面的投资额在逐年增加。
    在南斯拉夫旅行的时候，我们看到了一些新的企业：在南斯拉夫工程师的领导下，由南斯拉夫工人的双手建成的发电站和工厂。在霍尔瓦齐亚山我们看到了有大型先进技术装备的维诺多尔水力发电站。在里卡城我们看到了被恢复的（更正确地说是重新建成的）造船厂，这个造船厂建造排水量一万吨的船舰。在斯洛文尼亚的首都卢布尔雅纳我们参观了一所新的重型机器制造厂——“里托斯特罗依”，它是南斯拉夫劳动人民理当引以自豪的工厂。
    几年以前，在卢布尔雅纳郊区还是玉蜀黍的田野。现在这儿建设起来宽敞而明亮的工厂车间的厂房，发动机不停息地轰轰地响着。这个工厂制造涡轮机、起重机和其他的装备，供本国工业和输出之用。这个企业是按照有经验的建筑工程师埃多·米赫维茨的设计建成的。在建筑车间的时候广泛地应用了混凝土和钢筋混凝土。一切都是以主人翁的态度，节约而便利地做成的。广阔的柏油马路通向车间，工厂地区正在绿化起来——在工厂厂房的围墙附近，塔形的白杨树在竭力向上钻。
    在卢布尔雅纳郊区，广大的工人住宅区和“里托斯特罗依”工厂同时成长起来，为工人们建筑了许多良好的一排排的住房。工厂在发展着，劳动大军也增加着。
    一九三九年南斯拉夫有三十万工业工人，根据南斯拉夫报刊的材料，一九五四年已经增加到六十八万五千多人。大部分工业工人（近四十万人）在轻工业部门工作，一小部分在重工业部门工作。
    除“里托斯特罗依”工厂以外，在最近几年中已开工的大企业中，可以举出来的有热列兹尼克的机器制造工厂、谢沃依诺的炼铜厂和其他工厂。仅在一九五四年这一年间，开始生产的就有十个发电能力从五千至二万瓩的发电站、熔铸量为二十万吨生铁的熔铁炉、平炉、辗压机和捷尼茨的两个炼焦炉组、斯米捷列沃的冶金工厂的薄板辗压机、西萨克的冶金工厂的平炉，以及能生产六万吨无缝钢管的辗压机。战后时期，南斯拉夫重新建立了过去实际上没有的工业部门，像重型机器制造业、采油工业和炼油工业以及无线电器材工业等等。
    由于新企业的开工和广泛改建旧工厂，南斯拉夫的工业产量和战前比较显著地扩大了。
    根据官方的材料，以一九三九年工业产量水平为一百，一九五四年南斯拉夫工业生产的总指数已经达到二百零八。计划上规定，今年的工业生产指数将达到二百四十。
    虽然因为许多原因，南斯拉夫工业没有完成第一个五年计划，南斯拉夫的各种最重要的重工业（铜除外）的生产大大地提高了。我们从南斯拉夫的统计月刊“指数”（一九五五年第三期）摘出来的、从一九三九年到一九五四年这一期间的对照表就可以说明这一点。（以千吨为单位）  一九三九年    　一九五四年
    煤      　七、○三二  　一三、六四五
    石油　          一·一　     二一六·三
    生铁    　一○一　      三五六
    钢　      二三五　      六一六
    铜　            四一·六　   三○·三
    铅　            一○·六   　六六·七
    锌              　五         一三·六
    电力（以百万瓩时为单位）
              一、一七三　  三、四四○
    按照人口计算，一九五四年的工业生产比一九三九年扩大了：电力从七十三瓩时增加到一百九十九瓩时，煤从四百三十七公斤增加到七百九十公斤，钢从十五公斤增加到三十六公斤，纸从二点六公斤增加到三点四公斤，棉布从七平方公尺增加到十平方公尺，皮鞋从零点六双增加到零点八双。
    由于南斯拉夫工人阶级的忘我劳动，工业已经成为南斯拉夫国民收入的最主要的源泉。工业在国民收入中占百分之四十二点一，农业占百分之三十点三，商业和公用事业占百分之七点五，建筑业占百分之七点三，手工业占百分之四点八，运输业占百分之四点六。
    自然，南斯拉夫工业的发展也有它的困难。我们的南斯拉夫的交谈者——专家和新闻界的代表——也坦白地谈到了这一点。某些工业部门几乎完全依赖从外国输入的原料。例如，纺织工业所需棉花的百分之九十六都是依靠输入。橡胶工业是完全仰仗外来的原料。南斯拉夫也不得不输入焦煤、质量好的煤炭和其他原料。
    如果估计到，除各种工业原料以外，南斯拉夫也不得不输入大量的粮食，特别是谷物（最近几年有几次歉收），那就不难看到，为什么南斯拉夫的贸易会有对它不利的逆差；一九五三年，南斯拉夫的输出是五百五十八亿第纳尔，而输入是一千一百八十六亿第纳尔。南斯拉夫同美国的贸易形成一种特别不利的情况，因为美国在南斯拉夫的输出比例中占百分之九点七，而在输入比例中占百分之二十七点八。
    上月，南斯拉夫“经济政策”杂志报道，南斯拉夫同苏联、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克缔结了一九五五年第一季度的贸易总额为八千七百万美元的贸易协定。该杂志曾号召南斯拉夫的贸易组织在恢复和发展同苏联的有利于双方的商业联系方面表现积极性。
    在我们同南斯拉夫工人的谈话里，我们对于他们的物质生活很感兴趣。事实说明，许多工人家庭的物质生活水平在提高，居住条件在逐渐改善。国家对劳动人民的子女特别关怀。但是我们的南斯拉夫的朋友也没有隐瞒他们的困难，例如，由于许多情况，粮食的价格仍然高，这是要影响到劳动人民家庭的预算的。
    但是困难并没有吓倒南斯拉夫的工人。亲手建起新工厂的人们，感到自己是国家主人的人们是充满了克服这些困难的坚定决心的。
    我想起一位名叫斯切潘·昆季赫的工人，他是拉捷·康恰尔工厂的工厂工人委员会的主席。他站在拉捷·康恰尔这位英雄的纪念碑面前，对着参观这个工厂的尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫、尼·亚·布尔加宁和阿·伊·米高扬同志讲述他的同志们的忘我劳动，他最后说道：
      “我们为了我们国家的幸福而工作。我们有困难——我们在解决它们。没有斗争就不会有生活！”
    我热烈地希望拉捷·康恰尔工厂和“里托斯特罗依”工厂的工人、里卡的“五月三日”造船厂的工人，以及数以百计的南斯拉夫其他各企业的工人在国民经济的发展方面获得新的成就。
