    Changes in Hongha Village
    Yunnan Provincial Health Department Information Research Group
    Hongha Village is located in Laozhai Township, Xichou County, Wenshan Special District, in the southern border region of Yunnan Province. The village is inhabited by the Nong and Han ethnic groups, totaling 31 households and 171 people. Before liberation, diseases were prevalent here, seriously endangering the health and production of the people, and many fields were left barren. After the patriotic health campaign was launched in the winter of 1952, people of all ages in the village took action, consciously abided by the patriotic health pledge, established regular health systems, and did a good job in sanitation. They closely combined production and health work, taking manure and grass to the fields when they went to work in the morning, and carrying soil back to fill in the sewage pits in the village when they returned home in the evening. Because the sanitation work was done well, and it also served production well, few people in the village got sick, and production continued to increase. In 1953, grain production increased by 42 percent compared to 1952, and in 1954, grain production increased by another 55 percent compared to 1953. In 1954, the village had a surplus of 16,400 jin of grain, all of which was voluntarily sold to the state.
    When you arrive at Hongha Village, you can immediately see: beside the dense bamboo forest on the hillside, herds of fat cattle and sheep are grazing, and in the terraced fields on the mountain, groups of farmers are happily cultivating. The roads are clean and tidy, and the slopes in front of and behind the houses are planted with many banana groves and indigo sheds, a lush green, which looks particularly beautiful. The houses of every household are also arranged neatly, the walls, tables, chairs, and floors are very clean, and portraits of the beloved leader Chairman Mao are hung in the main hall. The pots, pans, bowls, and chopsticks in the kitchen are washed very clean. Many livestock pens have also been built outdoors, and the manure pits in the toilets are covered. Some people use bamboo to draw spring water from the mountains into the toilets for washing hands after defecation. Some families also use bamboo pipes to draw water and make shower facilities. At the public water source, there are bamboo-woven sand filter tanks, filled with sand, stones, and palm leaves, and the drinking water is filtered through the sand, making it particularly clean. In the past, five elderly people in the village who were bedridden year-round have recovered their health after receiving treatment. The children have also been freed from the entanglement of malaria, and their faces are rosy, lively, and lovely.
    These situations are vastly different from the past. People still remember the suffering of past years: every year in the summer and autumn seasons, diseases were prevalent, and 60 to 70 percent of the villagers would fall ill. There wasn't even a single toilet in the entire village, and everyone defecated everywhere, making the village filthy. The land in the village was all controlled by the despotic landlord in Lao Jie, ninety li away from the village. The peasants worked hard all year round, but they lacked food and clothing, and they were whipped when they paid rent. How could they have the heart to pay attention to hygiene? Listening to the lies of the landlord class, "Little people fear rain, and adults fear the ripening grain," people blamed their suffering, the forest, the water, the fog, the rain, and the harvest for their illnesses. They killed chickens and sheep to worship the mountains and ghosts, or blamed Zhang and blamed Li, causing disagreements among the villagers. In this way, one or twenty people would die unjustly every year, and some land would be abandoned.
    But now? Everything has changed. The people in the village have eliminated the landlord class and defeated the disease. Young people have turned it into a song and sing:
    "Thinking of the past! When the cogongrass blooms and the grain turns yellow, malaria is like a tiger and wolf! Fortunately, we have the Communist Party, leading us to fight against disasters, tens of thousands of people work together, villages and villages pay attention to hygiene, people are healthy and livestock are strong. Men, women, old and young are full of joy..."
    People have turned the story of Hongha Village's attention to hygiene into stories that spread everywhere, saying, "The masses coming and going to Hongha Village must be checked to see if they have lice." It spread to Tanshanzhai in Malipo, to Wufeng Village in Wenshan, to Mazhelong in Qiubei, and to surrounding counties, becoming a good example for farmers of all ethnic groups to learn from. The Xichou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party commended the sanitation work of Hongha Village, and the Wenshan Special Commissioner's Office awarded Hongha Village a model banner. The Yunnan Provincial Health Department summarized Hongha Village's experience of sanitation work serving production and compiled it into slides, pictures, comic strips, and films, promoting this experience to all parts of Yunnan Province.

    哄哈村的变化
    云南省卫生厅资料研究组
    哄哈村在云南省南部边疆文山专区西畴县老寨乡，村里居住着侬、汉两族人民，共有三十一户，一百七十一人。解放前这里疾病流行，严重危害着人民的健康和生产，曾有不少的田地荒芜了。一九五二年冬天开展爱国卫生运动后，这里的各族人民从老到少都行动起来，自觉地遵守爱国卫生公约，订立了经常的卫生制度，做好了卫生工作。他们把生产和卫生工作紧密地结合着进行，早上去生产时把粪草顺便带到田地里，傍晚回家时，又把泥土挑回来填平村中的污水坑。因为卫生工作做好了，又能很好地为生产服务，村子里很少有人生病，生产也不断提高。一九五三年粮食比一九五二年增产了百分之四十二，一九五四年粮食又比一九五三年增产了百分之五十五。一九五四年全村有余粮一万六千四百斤，都自动地卖给了国家。
    当你到哄哈村，一眼就可以看到：山坡上浓密的竹林旁，放牧着成群肥壮的牛羊，山地梯田里，三五结伴的农民们，正在愉快地耕作。大路两旁干干净净的，房前屋后的斜坡上，培植起许多芭蕉林、蓝靛棚，一片葱绿，显得格外美丽。家家户户的屋子里也摆设得整整齐齐，墙壁、桌椅和地面都很清洁，正堂上都悬挂着人人敬爱的领袖毛主席的像片。厨房里的锅盆碗筷洗刷得非常干净。室外还修盖了许多牲畜圈，厕所里的粪坑上都加了盖子，有的用竹子将山上的泉水引到厕所里，供大便后洗手用。有的人家还用竹管引水，做成了淋浴设备。在公共取水处，备有竹子编制的沙滤缸，里面放些沙石和棕叶，食用的水都经过沙滤，格外洁净。过去村子里五个长年卧病在床的老人，因为得到诊治，都恢复了健康。孩子们也摆脱了疟疾的纠缠，
  一个个脸色红润，活泼可爱。
    这些情形比起过去真是天渊之别。人们还都记得往年的苦难生活：每年一到夏秋两季，疾病流行，全村农民总要病倒十分之六、七。全村连一个厕所也没有，大家到处屙野屎，肮脏遍地。村子里的土地都是掌握在离村九十里以外老街的恶霸地主手里，农民终年勤劳，缺衣少吃，上租时还要挨皮鞭，哪里有心肠去讲究卫生。“小人怕雨水，大人怕谷黄”，听信地主阶级的这些谎言，人们有病就怨命苦、怨森林、怨水、怨雾、怨雨、怨秋收。杀鸡宰羊，祭山祭鬼；或怪张怪李，一村人互相闹意见。这样每年总要冤枉死去一、二十人，丢荒一些土地。
    可是现在呢？一切都变了，村里的人们消灭了地主阶级，战胜了病魔。年青人把它编成歌曲歌唱：
    “想往年啊！斑茅开花谷子黄，闷头摆子似虎狼！幸亏有了共产党，领导我们把灾抗，千万人民齐动手，村村寨寨讲卫生，人又健来畜又壮。男女老少喜洋洋。……”
    人们把哄哈村讲究卫生的事迹编成故事到处流传，说什么：“来往哄哈村的群众都要经过检查，看身上有没有虱子”。传到麻栗坡炭山寨，传到文山五峰村，传到邱北马者竜，传到周围各县，成为各族农民学习的好榜样。中共西畴县委会表扬了哄哈村的卫生工作，文山专署奖给了哄哈村模范旗。云南省卫生厅总结了哄哈村卫生工作为生产服务的经验，编制成幻灯、图片、连环画、电影片，把这个经验推广到云南全省各地。
