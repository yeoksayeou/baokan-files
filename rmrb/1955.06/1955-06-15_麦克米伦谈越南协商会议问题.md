Xinhua News Agency, London, June 14th: British Foreign Secretary Macmillan answered questions in the House of Commons on the 13th regarding the issue of a consultative conference between the authorities of the two regions of Vietnam.

Labor MP William Warbey asked Macmillan what work he had done to ensure the holding of a meeting between representatives of North and South Vietnam to prepare for the general election to be held in Vietnam in 1956.

Macmillan replied that the final declaration of the Geneva Conference on Indochina stipulated that the relevant authorities in North and South Vietnam should begin consultations on the issue of holding a general election in Vietnam from July 20th. He said: Organizing such consultations is not the responsibility of the British government, "but they naturally hope that such consultations can be held."

Another Labor MP, Christopher Mayhew, said that the British government bore a much closer responsibility than the Foreign Secretary stated. He said that because Eden and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov were the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the British government should take strong initiative to promote an agreement.

Macmillan stated: "Of course, the government bears full obligations for the final declaration of this conference." But, he said, "Sometimes it is best to let those who bear the primary responsibility handle this matter, and the main parties responsible in this issue are the authorities of North and South Vietnam."

    麦克米伦谈越南协商会议问题
    新华社十四日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣麦克米伦十三日在下院回答了议员们所提出的关于越南双方地区当局举行协商会议的问题。
    工党议员威廉·华贝问麦克米伦已经做了些什么工作，以保证举行南北越代表的会议而为将在一九五六年举行的全越普选进行准备。
    麦克米伦回答说，日内瓦会议就印度支那问题所发表的最后宣言规定，南北越双方有关当局应该从七月二十日开始举行关于在越南举行普选的问题的协商。他说：组织这种商谈并不是英国政府的责任，“可是他们自然希望这种商谈能够举行”。
    另一个工党议员克里斯托弗·梅林说，英国政府所负的责任比外交大臣所说的要密切得多。他说，因为艾登和苏联外交部长莫洛托夫是日内瓦会议的主席，英国政府应该采取强有力的主动以促使达成
  一项协议。
    麦克米伦声明说：“当然，政府对于这个会议的最后宣言承担着全部义务”。但是，他说：“有
  些时候最好是让负主要责任的人们来作这件事，在这个问题上的主要负责人是南北越双方当局”。
