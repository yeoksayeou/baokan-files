    On June 5th, the Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial entitled "Warsaw Treaty Enters into Force," saying that just as the Western aggressors and the West German fascist forces, who are rearming, are clamoring about their "policy of strength," the entry into force of the Warsaw Treaty will tie the hands of these new war instigators, preventing them from engaging in war adventures as they please. The "People's Tribune" emphasized that "the Warsaw Treaty has the full support of the powerful People's Republic of China, which is a major contribution to the consolidation of world peace."

    新华社华沙五日电　罗马尼亚人民共和国驻波兰大使扬尼斯库在六月四日向波兰人民共和国政府交存了五月十四日在华沙缔结的八国友好合作互助条约的批准书。
    至此，这个条约的所有缔约国都已经交存了批准书。根据条约第十条的规定，华沙条约已从六月四日起开始生效。
    六月五日，波兰“人民论坛报”以“华沙条约生效”为题发表社论说，正当西方侵略者和正在重新武装的西德法西斯势力口口声声叫喊他们的“实力政策”时，华沙条约的生效将束缚这些新战争制造者的手脚，使他们不能为所欲为地从事战争冒险。“人民论坛报”强调说“华沙条约有强大的中华人民共和国的全力支持，这是对巩固世界和平事业的重大贡献。”
