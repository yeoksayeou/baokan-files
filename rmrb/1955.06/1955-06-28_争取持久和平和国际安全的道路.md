These past few days, people of all countries have been attentively listening to the speeches at the United Nations Tenth Anniversary Commemorative Meeting. The speeches of representatives of many countries have expressed an earnest hope for easing international tensions and promoting international cooperation. In particular, the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was warmly welcomed. In this speech, Foreign Minister Molotov, based on the spirit of the United Nations Charter, pointed out the road to consolidating peace and building international trust. This speech has aroused a good response from all sides, and even some Western newspapers cannot help but admit that it has "attraction."

Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out that the United Nations Charter begins by stipulating that the goal of the United Nations is "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind." He solemnly declared: "'To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war'—this is the fundamental and highest task of the United Nations." Starting from this task, Foreign Minister Molotov emphasized that the United Nations can and must play a huge role in the struggle to consolidate peace and expressed that the Soviet Union is doing everything in its power to support all activities of the United Nations to ensure lasting peace and international security.

In his speech, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also mentioned the United Nations Charter repeatedly, but he dared not say that the task of the United Nations is to achieve the lofty goal of avoiding war. He promoted the United States' acts of aggression against Korea, against China, and in many places, including the overthrow of the governments of Guatemala and Costa Rica, saying that these were all implementing the principles of the United Nations Charter. He distorted Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, insisting that the right of United Nations member states to exercise individual and collective self-defense when subjected to armed attack can be used by so-called "like-minded countries" to organize military aggression groups. Dulles also disregarded the principle of "promoting international cooperation" stipulated in the United Nations Charter and vigorously promoted the "common security treaties" and so-called "collective security arrangements" that the United States had signed with forty-four other countries in order to create hostility and division. Every word of Dulles was promoting the United States' "policy of strength," and this "policy of strength" of threatening other countries with force violates the United Nations Charter.

The world demands the easing of international tensions, which first requires disarmament and a halt to the arms race. In order to strive to realize the people's demands, Molotov once again emphasized the Soviet government's proposal of May 10 on the issues of reducing armaments, prohibiting atomic weapons, and eliminating the threat of new wars. This proposal is a major contribution to the cause of consolidating peace. It puts forward what should be done to provide opportunities for implementing a broad disarmament plan and has eliminated the obstacles that have always existed in this regard in terms of specific measures for reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons. The Soviet proposal adopted all the claims of the United States, Britain, France, and Canada regarding the reduction of conventional armaments, and also approached the opinions of Western countries on the issue of atomic weapons. This makes it impossible for Western countries to use the so-called advantages of the Soviet Union and China in conventional armaments as an excuse to delay the resolution of the atomic weapons issue, and at the same time, it also leaves them with no reason to refuse to assume the solemn obligation to guarantee not to use nuclear weapons. The Soviet proposal also provides practical and feasible solutions to the issue of establishing effective international supervision and advocates convening a world conference before the first half of 1956 to discuss the various measures for implementing universal disarmament and to decide on the disarmament and troop levels of countries other than the five major powers.

The Soviet proposal has been warmly welcomed and widely supported by the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. Even the representatives of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France could not help but admit that the Soviet proposal has "narrowed" the differences existing on the disarmament issue and is "an encouraging development in many ways." However, because it was afraid that this proposal would be detrimental to its rapid rearmament of Germany, and in order to prevent countries that truly care about disarmament from participating in disarmament discussions, the United States tried its best to delay and obstruct the discussion of this proposal. Dulles even declared that he opposed the convening of a disarmament conference. At the United Nations Commemorative Meeting, Dulles pretended to say that he did not want an arms race, but in reality, he promoted the expansion of armaments and war preparations. He even insisted that the expansion of armaments and war preparations and the organization of military blocs promoted and implemented by the United States have "reduced armaments." In fact, just as Dulles was clamoring for expanding armaments and war preparations in disguise, the North Atlantic Group controlled by the United States was conducting large-scale so-called atomic bombing exercises in Europe. Besides deteriorating the atmosphere and triggering an arms race, what good can such exercises do? Can it create an atmosphere conducive to disarmament?

The United Nations Charter recognizes the principle of coexistence and peaceful cooperation between countries with different social and economic systems. Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out that this principle has been brutally violated, especially in the case of China, which is even more obvious. Foreign Minister Molotov believes that the failure to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is intolerable; the fact that Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands of China, these inseparable territories of China, have not yet been returned to China is also intolerable. The United Nations has a responsibility to take corresponding measures to resolve this issue as soon as possible. The joint statement between the Soviet Union and India also believes that China's legitimate rights to Taiwan must be satisfied, and the United Nations must restore China's legitimate status. Resolving these issues will help strengthen the status of the United Nations and help consolidate peace.

However, the United States is firmly hostile to China. Everyone knows that it is the United States that occupies China's territory of Taiwan, and it is the United States that claims to fight against China from the three fronts of Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina. But Dulles once again used the United Nations platform to conduct "cold war" provocations against our country, falsely accusing China of being an aggressor. It is well known that our country has repeatedly stated that it can ease tensions through negotiations. More and more people disapprove of the United States' actions of armed interference in our country's internal affairs. The Prime Minister of Pakistan recently stated that the U.S. Seventh Fleet should withdraw from the Taiwan Strait. What is the United States' response to these expressions of peace? Should it continue to slander China and continue to "formulate long-term plans to make Taiwan a powerful link in the Western (American) defense chain"? The United States is doing its best to undermine the Geneva Accords, attempting to undermine the general election in Vietnam, and accelerating the transformation of Laos and Cambodia into its military bases. This action of the United States in Indochina has aroused widespread concern among peace-loving countries and people. The joint statement between the Soviet Union and India pointed out that the further implementation of the Geneva "Accords is now under some threat of being undermined due to some sudden new events." The joint statement between the Prime Ministers of India and Poland also emphasized that the Geneva Accords should be fully implemented. The obvious threat to peace and security can never be covered up by Dulles alone; at the same time, it can never be tolerated by peace-loving people.

Recently, due to a series of proactive measures taken by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, the international situation has shown some easing. The overall situation has forced the United States to agree to convene a Four-Power conference. The speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov correctly pointed out the path to further easing international tensions and striving for lasting peace and international security. This is in line with the deep aspirations of the people of the world. The Chinese people warmly welcome this speech. Dulles attempted to block this road by threatening and slandering the Chinese people. But this is impossible. No threats or clamors can intimidate the Chinese people. It can only place the war merchants in an increasingly isolated position and eventually lead to a shameful failure.

### 争取持久和平和国际安全的道路

    争取持久和平和国际安全的道路
    最近这些天，世界各国人民都在注意地倾听着联合国十周年纪念会上的言论。许多国家的代表的演说，都表示了对于缓和国际局势和促进国际合作的殷切期望。特别是苏联外交部长莫洛托夫的演说受到了热烈的欢迎。在这个演说中，莫洛托夫外长根据联合国宪章的主旨，指出了巩固和平和建立国际间信任的道路。这个演说引起了各方面的良好反应，甚至有一些西方报纸也不能不承认它有“吸引力”。
    莫洛托夫外长指出，联合国宪章一开头就规定了联合国成立的目标是“欲免后世再遭近代人类两度身历惨不堪言之战祸”。他严正宣布：“‘欲免后世再遭战祸’——这就是联合国根本的、最高的任务。”从这个任务出发，莫洛托夫外长强调指出，联合国能够而且必须在争取巩固和平的斗争中起巨大作用，并表示苏联正在尽它的一切力量来支持联合国的一切活动，保证持久和平和国际安全。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在他的演说中也口口声声提到联合国宪章，但是他却不敢说联合国的任务是在于实现避免战祸这个崇高目的。他宣扬美国对朝鲜，对中国，对许多地方的侵略行为，包括推翻危地马拉和哥斯达黎加政府在内，把这些都说成是实施联合国宪章的原则。他歪曲联合国宪章第五十一条的规定，硬把联合国会员国家在受到武力攻击时得行使单独和集体自卫的权利说成是可以由所谓“志同道合的国家”来组织军事侵略集团。杜勒斯还不顾联合国宪章规定的“促成国际合作”的原则，极力鼓吹美国为了制造敌对和分裂同其他四十四个国家签订的“共同安全条约”和所谓“集体安全安排”。杜勒斯的每一句话都是在宣扬美国的“实力政策”，而这种以武力威胁其他国家的“实力政策”是违反联合国宪章的。
    全世界要求缓和国际紧张局势，这首先就要求实行裁军，停止军备竞赛。为了争取实现人民的要求，莫洛托夫再一次着重提出了苏联政府在五月十日提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议。这个建议是对巩固和平事业的重大贡献。它提出了为实施广泛的裁军计划提供机会而应当做到的事情，并在裁减军备和禁止原子武器的具体措施上，消除了一向在这方面存在着的障碍。苏联的建议采纳了美、英、法和加拿大关于裁减常规军备的一切主张，并在原子武器的问题上也接近了西方国家的意见。这样就使西方国家再也不能以所谓苏联和中国在常规军备方面的优势为借口来拖延原子武器问题的解决，同时，这也使它们再没有理由来拒绝承担保证不使用核子武器的庄严义务。苏联的建议对建立有效的国际监督的问题也提供了切实可行的办法，并主张在一九五六年上半年以前召开一次世界会议，来讨论实施普遍裁军的各项措施以及决定五大国之外的其他国家裁减军备和军队水平的问题。
    苏联的建议受到了中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎和广泛的支持。甚至美、英、法三国政府的代表，也不能不承认苏联的建议已使裁军问题上存在的分歧“缩小了”，并且“在许多方面是令人鼓舞的发展”。可是，因为害怕这个建议会不利于它迅速重新武装德国，为了不让真正关心裁军的国家参加裁军讨论，美国竭力拖延和阻挠对这个建议的讨论。杜勒斯而且声言他反对召开裁军会议。杜勒斯在联合国纪念会上假装说不要军备竞赛，但是他实际上却宣传扩军备战。他甚至硬说美国所倡导和推行的扩军备战和组织军事集团活动使“军备减少”。事实上正当杜勒斯这样变相叫嚣扩军备战的时候，美国控制的北大西洋集团却在欧洲大举进行所谓原子轰炸演习。难道这种演习除了恶化气氛，挑起军备竞赛之外，还能有什么好作用？难道它能够造成有利于裁军的空气吗？
    联合国宪章承认了不同社会和经济制度的国家共处以及和平合作的原则。莫洛托夫外长指出，这个原则遭到了粗暴的破坏，特别是在中国的情形上更为显然。莫洛托夫外长认为中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利仍未恢复，是不能容忍的；台湾、澎湖及中国沿海岛屿这些中国的不可分割的领土至今还没有归还中国的这种情况，也是不应当容忍的。联合国有责任从速采取相应措施来解决这个问题。苏印两国联合声明也认为中国对台湾的合法权利必须满足，联合国必须恢复中国的合法地位。解决这些问题就有助于联合国地位的加强，有助于和平的巩固。
    但是，美国却坚决同中国为敌。人人知道，是美国侵占中国领土台湾，是美国宣称要从台湾、朝鲜、印度支那的三条战线来对中国作战。可是杜勒斯却再一次利用联合国的讲坛对我国进行“冷战”挑衅，诬蔑中国是侵略者。人所共知，我国已经多次表示可以经过谈判来缓和紧张局势。越来越多的人不赞成美国武装干涉我国内政的行动。巴基斯坦总理最近就表示，美国第七舰队应该撤离台湾海峡。美国对于这些和平表示的答复是什么呢？难道应该是继续诬蔑中国，继续“制订长远计划，使台湾成为西方（美国）防御锁链中强大的一环”？美国竭力破坏日内瓦协议，企图破坏越南普选，加紧把老挝和柬埔寨变成它的军事基地。美国在印度支那的这种行动，已经引起了爱好和平的国家和人民的广泛忧虑。苏印联合声明就指出：日内瓦“协定的进一步实现，现在由于突然发生的一些新事件而有受到破坏的某种威胁”。印波两国总理联合声明也强调日内瓦协议应该全部实施。人所共见的对和平和安全的威胁，决不是杜勒斯一手能够掩盖过去的；同时也决不是爱好和平人民所能容忍的。
    最近，由于苏联和其他爱好和平国家所采取的一系列的主动措施，国际局势出现了一些缓和。整个局势迫使美国不能不同意召开四大国会议。苏联外交部长莫洛托夫的演说正确地指出了进一步和缓国际紧张局势、争取持久和平和国际安全的道路。这是符合于世界人民的深切愿望的。中国人民热烈欢迎这个演说。杜勒斯企图用威胁和诬蔑中国人民的办法来堵塞这条道路。但，这是办不到的。任何威胁和叫嚣都吓不倒中国人民。它只能使战争贩子处于日益孤立的地位，而最后走向可耻的失败。
