    Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture Conducts Self-Criticism for Defending Localism
    A letter from the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture states: The People's Daily articles "Moving the Vineyard" published on January 9th and "Why is the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture Defending Localism?" published on April 17th are correct, and we have conducted further investigations based on the Party newspaper's criticism. After investigation, we realized that Comrade Jia Rongshu, in handling the transfer of the Dalai Fishery, one-sidedly emphasized taking care of the department he was about to lead, and indeed had the error of localism. However, because we did not analyze and examine the problem from its essence, we did not help educate Comrade Jia Rongshu to improve his understanding, point out the essence of the problem, and criticize his erroneous thinking. Instead, we emphasized "factual discrepancies" and hastily replied to the Party newspaper. This was not only unhelpful to Comrade Jia Rongshu, but also extremely unfavorable to improving work and raising the level of staff. In short, this criticism has given us a further improvement in understanding. We plan to strengthen education against localism among all staff in the department, establish a spirit of collectivism and a solid work style, and prevent such problems from happening again.

    黑龙江省农业厅检讨替本位主义者辩护的错误
    黑龙江省农业厅来信：人民日报于一月九日发表的“葡萄园搬家”和四月十七日发表的“黑龙江省农业厅为什么替本位主义者辩护”是应该的，我们根据党报的批评作了进一步的检查。经过检查认识到贾荣澍同志在处理大赉渔场的移交工作中，片面地强调照顾自己将要领导的部门，确有本位主义的错误。但是由于我们没有从问题的本质来分析、检查，因此没有帮助教育贾荣澍同志提高认识，指出问题的实质和批判他的错误的思想，反而强调了“事实有出入”，草率地答复党报。这不但对贾荣澍同志没有帮助，而且对改进工作和提高工作人员的水平都是极端不利的。总之，这次批评使我们在认识上有了进一步的提高，准备在全厅工作人员中加强反对本位主义思想的教育，树立集体主义精神和踏实的工作作风，防止今后再发生这类问题。
