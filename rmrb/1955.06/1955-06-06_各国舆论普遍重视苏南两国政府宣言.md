    Korea
    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" editorial stated: The declaration issued by the Soviet and Yugoslav governments after talks conducted in a spirit of friendship and mutual understanding demonstrates that the delegations of the two governments have achieved significant results in easing international tensions and safeguarding and consolidating world peace and the security of all nations. The editorial pointed out that the success of the talks between the two countries is a blow to the "position of strength" policy that exacerbates international tensions, and a major contribution to the forces of peace and socialism.
    Poland
    The Polish "People's Tribune" wrote that the principles of the declaration are the principles of peaceful coexistence. "People's Tribune" continued, Polish public opinion is very satisfied with the part of the declaration that addresses the German question, which states: the German question should be resolved in accordance with the wishes and interests of the German people, and in accordance with the interests of universal security.

They see in this declaration the strengthening of the unity of the working people in the struggle for peace, collective security and socialism.
    Romania
    The Romanian "Spark" wrote: The significance of the Belgrade Declaration lies in the fact that it is based on principles of great international value upon which the two governments base their foreign relations; in the common views on how to resolve some of the most pressing international problems; and in the practical measures that establish how to strengthen future cooperation and friendship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. "Spark" wrote that the Joint Declaration of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments emphasizes the need to strengthen the role and prestige of the United Nations, in this regard it suggests restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and accepting other countries that meet the requirements of the UN Charter as members. Among these countries, the Romanian People's Republic has an undeniable right to be admitted into the United Nations organization. "Spark" also said that the agreement reached in Belgrade can only have a beneficial impact on the continuous improvement of relations between the people's democratic countries and Yugoslavia.
    Czechoslovakia
    The Czechoslovak "Red Right Newspaper" said that our people wholeheartedly welcome the declaration agreed upon by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, considering it a new great victory for the cause of peace, democracy and progress.

The Czechoslovak people hope that further progress will be made in the complete normalization of relations with Yugoslavia.
    Hungary
    The Hungarian "Free People's Daily" believes that the joint declaration of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments is "a document of particularly great significance for consolidating peace and establishing trust and cooperation between all peoples and all countries." The newspaper said that the common views of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments on some of the most pressing international issues are an extremely important contribution to the consolidation of peace. "People's Voice" pointed out that the declaration of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments disrupts the war plans of the imperialists and the proponents of the "position of strength" policy.
    Bulgaria
    The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" wrote: The road between Belgrade and Moscow has been opened. This permanent road is based on mutual trust and respect for each other's interests. This is a road towards peace and comprehensive cooperation.
    Albania
    The Albanian "People's Voice" emphasized that the successful conclusion of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks is a victory for peace and democracy, a failure for the forces advocating war and oppression of the people, and a failure for the imperialists. The newspaper said that the Albanian people welcome the results of the talks, considering it a great achievement. After the declaration was published, we saw that new possibilities have arisen for further developing our relations with Yugoslavia.

    The "Berlin Daily" wrote that the agreement reached between the Soviet and Yugoslav governments means a victory for all peace-loving mankind and a defeat for the warmongers. The newspaper went on to say that the Germans welcome the mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia because it is in the interests of peace and is another proof, after the resolution of the Austrian question, that a peaceful resolution of the German question is possible.
    West Berlin newspapers have published editorials commenting on the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks. "Telegraph" affirmed that the Bonn government and the opposition parties "both welcome the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks, considering it a sign of easing tensions."
