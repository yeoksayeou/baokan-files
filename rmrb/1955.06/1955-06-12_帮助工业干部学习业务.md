    Helping industrial cadres learn business is one of the most pressing tasks in current industrial construction. We must strive to cultivate and educate industrial cadres so that they can not only continuously improve their theoretical knowledge and policy understanding, but also continuously improve their professional and technical skills, making them experts in their fields.
    The fact that the professional level of many industrial enterprises' leading staff cannot meet objective requirements is a very acute problem. This problem is even more prominent in newly built factories. Some newly constructed factories and mines, due to the lack of professional knowledge of the leading staff, cannot be put into production on schedule after completion. Even if they are put into production on schedule, the lack of professional knowledge among the cadres managing these brand-new equipments leads to various chaotic phenomena in production. The efficiency of the new equipments cannot be fully utilized, and even causes huge losses to the country. Therefore, strengthening the training of existing industrial cadres is an urgent task.
    At present, many industrial departments have not paid enough attention to the training of cadres. They have not formulated long-term plans for cadre training based on the needs of production development, nor have they vigorously implemented them. Some leading staff in industrial departments are satisfied with the status quo, do not pay attention to training cadres, and even regard cadre training as being in opposition to completing production tasks, using the excuse of heavy workload to abandon organizing cadres to study. This approach lacks foresight. It is a fact that production tasks are heavy, but spending some time today, investing some manpower, and even putting aside some work that can be delayed, to organize cadres to study, can fundamentally improve the work situation. This is a very obvious principle.
    Some enterprises ask the higher authorities for cadres when they lack them, instead of paying attention to training their own cadres. This practice must be corrected. We should see that the country is building a large number of new factories and mines, which require many cadres. Under normal circumstances, today we should not only refrain from casually asking the higher authorities for personnel, but also continuously draw core forces from existing cadres to support newly built factories and mines. This further illustrates how urgently the training of existing cadres needs to be strengthened.
    We should adopt various effective methods to help existing industrial cadres study their professions diligently. There is already a lot of experience in this area, which should be studied and summarized. Organizing industrial cadres for professional study can take various forms. For example, local industrial departments can hold specialized lectures and spare-time cultural and technical schools, or they can mobilize and organize factory and mine technical personnel and certain cadres to sign teaching contracts. These spare-time studies, if well organized and led, will achieve significant results. In 1954, the Heavy Industry Management Department of the Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau held a business management study class, organizing enterprise cadres to conduct systematic study, which yielded good results. Eighty-five percent of the students passed the examination, improving their ability to manage socialist enterprises.
    It is also necessary to transfer some cadres away from production for short-term rotational training. In 1954, the Coal Mine General Bureau and the Electric Power General Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry held training classes for cadres at the level of bureau chiefs, factory directors, and mine directors for more than one year, and research classes for several months. Soviet experts gave lectures, combined with summarizing work and exchanging experience. Everyone felt that they had gained a lot. Those who originally lacked confidence in their work and wanted to change careers greatly increased their confidence after studying. This year, the Ministry of Fuel Industry will also plan to train 600 cadres above the level of factory and mine directors. This is a very good method.
    In order to help cadres study their professions diligently, it is necessary to first help some older cadres with lower cultural levels, as well as new cadres promoted from workers, to carry out certain cultural studies. At present, many enterprise cadres have low cultural levels. According to statistics from the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, among the responsible staff at the level of factory, mine director, and workshop director, those with an educational level below primary school account for 76.1 percent. The cultural level of grassroots staff is even lower. Among the engineering and technical personnel in the coal mine system, 30 percent have a cultural level below primary school, and illiterates account for 5.4 percent. The low cultural level of the staff increases the difficulty of learning technology. Modern industry is built on a high degree of science and technology. Without cultural and scientific knowledge, one cannot thoroughly understand production. Therefore, various industrial departments should also formulate plans to improve the cultural level of cadres.
    Learning from the Soviet Union and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts is an important part of the professional study of industrial cadres. To manage socialist enterprises well, industrial cadres must arm themselves with socialist enterprise management knowledge and advanced scientific and technological knowledge. Today, many of our factories and mines have direct guidance from Soviet experts, who are very enthusiastic about training cadres. There are also many sets of advanced Soviet experience that can be learned from in factories and mines without experts. We should be good at using these favorable conditions to carry out learning activities among cadres.
    Many industrial cadres are now developing a dangerous sense of complacency, which is affecting their learning. In 1954, the Industry Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee held a "Lecture on Professional Knowledge of Industrial Enterprise Management" to help cadres in the industrial system learn from the advanced Soviet experience in socialist enterprise management. The listeners were very enthusiastic, but some factory leaders were absent for a long time. Some industrial cadres were able to learn humbly at the beginning, but became arrogant as soon as they gained some knowledge. This is very wrong. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The enemy of learning is one's own satisfaction. To learn something seriously, one must start from not being complacent." These comrades should understand this instruction well. If you initially started from not being complacent and therefore learned some knowledge, then you should continue to humbly be a primary school student and always maintain a humble attitude.
    Some comrades have shown a lack of confidence in learning, and this attitude must also be corrected. Of course, learning industry is relatively complicated, but it is not impossible to learn well. Today, we have many good conditions for learning. As long as we are determined, we can definitely learn well. Many facts can prove this. Wu Yunduo is a vivid example. In frequent battles, thanks to the education and cultivation of the Party and his own efforts, he transformed from an ordinary worker into a leading staff member with rich technical knowledge. Now our learning conditions are much better than those of Wu Yunduo in those years. We have schools, books, and teachers everywhere. What good conditions these are! Every industrial cadre should cherish these superior conditions and step up their learning. As long as we study hard, we will definitely be able to learn many skills.

### 帮助工业干部学习业务

    帮助工业干部学习业务
    努力培养和教育工业干部，使他们不但能够不断提高自己的理论修养和政策水平，而且还能够不断提高自己的业务技术水平，使他们成为内行，成为专家。这是当前工业建设中最迫切的任务之一。
    现时有许多工业企业的领导工作人员的业务水平不能适应客观的要求，这是十分尖锐的问题。在新建的工厂中这个问题更为突出。有一些新建设的厂矿，由于领导工作人员缺乏业务知识，在建成后不能按期投入生产。有的即使按期投入了生产，由于管理这些全新设备的企业干部缺乏业务知识，以至在生产中造成种种混乱现象，新设备的效能不能充分发挥，甚至给国家造成巨大的损失。因此，加强对于现有工业干部的培养和训练的工作已是刻不容缓的了。
    现在有不少的工业部门对培养干部的工作没有引起足够重视，没有根据生产发展的需要制定出培养干部的长远计划，并大力贯彻执行。有些工业部门的领导工作人员满足于现状，不注意培养干部，甚至把培养干部的工作和完成生产任务对立起来，借口工作任务繁重就放弃组织干部进行学习。这种做法是缺乏远见的。生产任务繁重是事实，但是今天花费一些时间，付出一些人力，甚至放下一些可以缓办的工作，组织干部学习，就可以从根本上改善工作状况。这是很明显的道理。
    有些企业缺少干部就伸手向上级要，而不注意自己培养干部，这种做法必须纠正。我们应当看到，国家正在建设大批新的工厂和矿山，需要很多干部。在一般的情况下，今天我们不但不应当随便地再向上级伸手要人，而且还应该不断地从现有干部中抽调骨干力量去支援新建厂矿。这就更加说明了对现有干部的培养和训练工作是多么迫切需要加强的了。
    我们应当采用各种有效的方法帮助现有的工业干部钻研业务。在这方面已有不少的经验，应当加以研究和总结。组织工业干部的业务学习可以采取多种多样的形式。例如可以由当地的工业部门举办专门讲座和业余文化技术学校，也可以动员和组织厂矿技术人员和某些干部签订教学合同。这些业余学习只要很好加以组织和领导就会收到显著的效果。天津市地方国营工业局重工业管理处在一九五四年举办了企业管理学习班，组织企业干部进行系统的学习，收效很好，百分之八十五的学员都考试及格，提高了他们管理社会主义企业的能力。
    抽调一些干部脱离生产，实行短期轮训也很必要。燃料工业部煤矿总局和电业总局一九五四年举办了局长、厂长和矿长一级的干部一年以上的训练班和几个月的研究班，由苏联专家进行讲授，并结合着总结工作，交流经验，大家都觉得收获很大；原来工作没有信心，要求改行的，经过学习以后，信心大大地提高了。今年燃料工业部还将有计划地训练厂矿长以上干部六百人。这是一个很好的方法。
    为了帮助干部钻研业务，对于一些文化水平较低的老干部，以及从工人中提拔起来的新干部，首先需要帮助他们进行一定的文化学习。目前企业干部中有许多文化水平是低的。据燃料工业部煤矿管理总局的统计，在厂、矿长及车间主任一级的负责工作人员中，文化程度在小学以下的占百分之七十六点一，至于基层工作人员文化水平就更低。在煤矿系统中的工程技术人员中，也有百分之三十是小学以下的文化程度，文盲还占百分之五点四。工作人员文化水平不高，就增加了学习技术的困难。近代工业是建筑在高度的科学技术基础上的，没有文化科学知识，就不能透彻地了解生产。因此，各工业部门也应该制定提高干部文化水平的计划。
    学习苏联、执行苏联专家建议是工业干部业务学习的一个重要内容。要管好社会主义的企业，工业干部就必须用社会主义的企业管理知识和先进的科学技术知识来武装自己。今天，我们的许多厂矿都有苏联专家直接指导，他们对培养干部是十分热情的。没有专家的厂矿也有许多成套的苏联先进经验可以借鉴，我们应该善于利用这些有利条件，在干部中开展学习活动。
    有不少的工业干部现在滋长着一种危险的自满情绪，影响着他们的学习。一九五四年中共沈阳市委工业部曾举办了一个“工业企业管理业务知识讲座”，帮助工业系统中的干部学习苏联先进的社会主义企业管理经验，听讲者十分踊跃，但是也有一些工厂负责干部长期缺席。有些工业干部在开始的时候还能虚心学习，但稍微摸到一些门路就骄傲起来。这是非常错误的。毛泽东同志教导我们：“学习的敌人是自己的满足，要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始。”这些同志应当很好地体会这一指示，如果当初你是从不自满开始因而学习到一点知识的话，那末现在就应当继续虚心地做一个小学生，永远保持谦虚的态度。
    有些同志在学习中表现了信心不足，这种态度也要纠正。当然，学习工业是比较复杂的，但也不是不能学好的。今天我们有着进行学习的许多良好条件，只要下定决心，一定可以学习得好的。许多事实都可以证明这一点。吴运铎就是一个生动的例子。在频繁的战斗中，由于党的教育培养和自己的努力，他由一个普通的工人变成了一个具有丰富技术知识的领导工作人员。现在我们的学习条件比当年的吴运铎要好得多，我们到处都有学校、有书籍、有教员，这是多么好的条件啊！每一个工业干部都要珍惜这些优越条件，加紧学习；只要我们努力学习，我们就一定能够学会许多本领。
