    The US Wants to Turn South Vietnam into a Second South Korea
    Cui Qi

    On May 18th, French newspaper "Le Monde" published a dispatch from Saigon by its special correspondent, Robert Guillain, stating that the United States is adopting a "Korean-style policy" in South Vietnam. This report is noteworthy. In order to threaten the peace of Vietnam and oppose the democratic unification of Vietnam, the United States is trying every possible means to split Vietnam, so as to turn South Vietnam into a second South Korea. A simple comparison of the United States' past practices in Korea and its activities in South Vietnam in recent years will clearly show this.

    After the end of World War II, Korea was liberated from the control of Japanese militarism, and it was entirely possible at that time to establish an independent, democratic, and unified country in accordance with its national aspirations. The Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, held in December 1945, reached an agreement on the Korean issue. In order to rebuild Korea into an independent state and develop Korea in accordance with democratic principles, the conference decided to establish a unified Korean provisional government. However, the United States did not implement this solemn international agreement, but adopted a path of splitting Korea. On May 10, 1948, the United States used the "United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea" as its tool of intervention to hold separate "elections" in South Korea, imposing its agents on the people of South Korea and establishing the dictatorial rule of the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea, deepening the division of Korea. The situation created by the United States greatly facilitated its subsequent launch of a war of aggression in Korea. Although this war has been stopped by peace-loving forces, the issue of Korean unification has not been resolved to this day due to the obstruction of the United States.

    Now, people see that the United States is moving this despicable trick to Vietnam to implement. Ngo Dinh Diem was chosen to play the role of Syngman Rhee in Vietnam, and his political relationship with the United States is beyond doubt. The French "Forum of the Nation" reported on July 30, 1954, that before taking office, Ngo Dinh Diem had met with Cardinal Spellman of New York, "In these talks, the general political line of the new government was decided, and certain details of cooperation between the Vietnamese government and the US representative in Indochina were confirmed."

    The Geneva Conference agreements reached on the basis of respecting the national demands of the Vietnamese people have stipulated the solution of military issues as a prerequisite for the realization of Vietnam's political self-determination, and Vietnam should achieve democratic unification through free general elections. However, for eleven months, the United States has continuously undermined the Geneva Accords, attempting to intensify the situation in Vietnam, destabilize the ceasefire in Vietnam, and prevent the unification of Vietnam. As early as shortly after the signing of the Geneva Accords, on August 6, 1954, a reporter for the American "Christian Science Monitor" reported that the United States "can only expect Indochina to be almost permanently divided. In other words, the US government does not believe that the national elections stipulated in the ceasefire agreement can be realized." The reporter wrote that the United States insisted that "elections should be held under the auspices and supervision of the United Nations" because this would allow "any plan to hold general elections to be broken." The American "Time" magazine, published on April 4 this year, admitted more frankly that "the United States and South Vietnam must implement a policy of division" in order to maintain "two Vietnams." In order to cover up its undermining of the Geneva Accords and obstructing Vietnam from achieving unification through free general elections, the United States spread various lies slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In November 1954, former US Special Envoy to South Vietnam, Collins, openly stated that "it is inconceivable to hold free elections" in North Vietnam. On March 8 this year, US Secretary of State Dulles also said: "It would be difficult to create conditions in North Vietnam that would allow people to have genuine elections." While slanderously slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, they put forward the so-called argument of UN-supervised elections, which is obviously a violation of the provisions of the Geneva Agreement, in an attempt to complicate the issue.

    Under the instigation and support of the United States, concrete actions to undermine Vietnam's general elections have begun in South Vietnam. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique has unilaterally announced "election laws," preparing to create so-called "National Assembly" elections in South Vietnam in an atmosphere of terror, according to the American blueprint for splitting Korea. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique also declared that South Vietnam "has no obligation" to participate in next year's all-Vietnam elections, and they want to use the "government produced" by the separate elections in South Vietnam to "bind" the Vietnamese people. Now, because the Democratic Republic of Vietnam insists on negotiating general elections in accordance with the ceasefire agreement, and because peace-loving countries and people resolutely demand the fulfillment of the provisions of the Geneva Accords, it is rumored that Dulles has also expressed the hope that the Vietnamese general election can be held. People believe that Dulles's words should count. Words spoken under the pressure of the people cannot be practically swallowed back through various obstructive and destructive shady behaviors.

    At the same time, the United States supports its agents in establishing a police terror regime, trampling on civil rights, and using force to eliminate dissidents. This is exactly the same as its approach in South Korea. In South Korea, after the United States supported the Syngman Rhee clique, it made every effort to strengthen its violent rule over the people of South Korea. The Syngman Rhee clique massacred countless people in South Korea, and even those "members of parliament" who had the slightest dissatisfaction were persecuted, arrested, and assassinated. In South Vietnam, the United States is trying to strengthen the dictatorial rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in order to turn South Vietnam into a US military base. In the half year after the ceasefire in Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique massacred more than 800 people and arrested more than 13,000 people in order to suppress the demands of the South Vietnamese residents for freedom and democracy. Recently, the United States has again instigated the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to create a civil war in South Vietnam to eliminate dissidents. After visiting South Vietnam at the end of March, "The Times of India" reporter Reddy came to the strong impression that South Vietnam "is gradually forming a military dictatorship similar to that of South Korea."

    In South Korea, the United States, through the reactionary rule of Syngman Rhee, used military "aid" to turn it into a US supply base for cannon fodder and a military bridgehead. Now, the United States is carrying out the same activities in South Vietnam. The United States has taken over the "training rights" of the South Vietnamese army from France, expanded the US military advisory group, and directly "aided" the Ngo Dinh Diem clique with large amounts of money and weapons. According to the so-called Collins plan formulated by the United States this year, the United States wants to reorganize the existing South Vietnamese troops into an army of 140,000 people by the end of the year, and establish a "reserve force" of 150,000 people and many "local police forces." Collins openly admitted that this plan was carried out according to the "experience gained by the United States in Korea and Greece."

    These steps taken by the United States to recruit cannon fodder and establish military bridgeheads are related to its plans to prepare for a war of aggression. The facts in Korea have most clearly illustrated this point. In June 1950, before the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, Roberts, the head of the US "Military Advisory Group" stationed in South Korea, said: "The Military Advisory Group is living proof that with the wisdom and intensive 'investment' of 500 seasoned American officers and soldiers, 100,000 people can be trained to fight for you." Now, in South Vietnam, Collins has also openly declared, "If the South Vietnamese army is encouraged, they will also fight the Communists." The British "Tribune" reported that the United States will "encourage" the South Vietnamese authorities to "violate the terms of the Geneva Accords and re-launch the Indochina War" when "necessary."

    It is very clear that the United States' pursuit of these divisive plans and war plans is to make the tragedy and disaster of Korea replay in Vietnam. Therefore, an article published in the Indian "Delhi Times" weekly on June 10 expressed legitimate anxiety about the US interference in South Vietnam. The author of the article wrote, "Political observers fear that the good work done in Geneva to promote a ceasefire and achieve a final settlement in Indochina may be completely undermined by something happening in South Vietnam."

    Today, the military part of the Geneva Conference agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam has been basically realized. The major tasks facing the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people are: to continue to stabilize the ceasefire in Vietnam, resolutely implement the political terms of the Geneva Accords, and complete the peaceful unification of Vietnam. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has long declared that it is ready to hold consultative meetings with the representative responsible authorities of South Vietnam from July 20, 1955, to discuss the organization of free general elections throughout Vietnam in July 1956. It is very clear that all parties concerned who have obligations to implement the Geneva Accords should be concerned about and support the smooth progress of this consultation work. At such a time, people cannot but be particularly vigilant and oppose the US conspiracy to split Vietnam. This conspiracy must be exposed and broken, and efforts must be made to fully realize the Geneva Accords.

    美国想把南越变成第二个南朝鲜
    崔奇
    五月十八日，法国“世界报”刊载的该报特派记者罗伯·纪兰发自西贡的通讯说：美国正在南越采取“朝鲜型的政策”。这个报道是值得注意的。美国为了威胁越南的和平，反对越南的民主统一，正想方设法，要分裂越南，以便把南越变成第二个南朝鲜。只要对美国过去在朝鲜的做法和它近年来在南越的活动作一简单的比较，就能清楚地看到这一点。
    第二次世界大战结束后，朝鲜从日本军国主义的控制下获得了解放，那时它本来完全有可能按照自己的民族愿望建立一个独立、民主和统一的国家。一九四五年十二月在莫斯科召开的苏英美三外长会议，曾就朝鲜问题达成协议。为了重建朝鲜成为独立国家，并依据民主原则发展朝鲜，会议决议设立一个统一的朝鲜临时政府。但是，美国不执行这个庄严的国际协议，而采取了分裂朝鲜的路线。一九四八年五月十日，美国以“联合国朝鲜临时委员会”为其干涉工具，在南朝鲜举行了单独的“选举”，把它的代理人强加在南朝鲜人民的头上，建立起李承晚集团在南朝鲜的独裁统治，加深了朝鲜的分裂。美国所一手造成的这种局面，大大地便利了它后来在朝鲜发动侵略战争。虽然这个战争已被爱好和平的力量所制止，但是由于美国的阻挠，朝鲜的统一问题迄今未得解决。
    现在，人们看到，美国正在把这套卑劣的手法搬到越南来施展。吴庭艳被选择来担当越南的李承晚的角色，他和美国的政治关系是无可怀疑的。一九五四年七月三十日的法国“民族论坛报”曾报道，吴庭艳在上台之前曾和纽约红衣主教史培尔曼会谈过，“在这些会谈中决定了新政府的总政治路线，并且肯定了越南政府与美国驻印度支那代表间合作的某些细节”。
    日内瓦会议在尊重越南人民的民族要求的基础上所达成的协定，已经规定了军事问题的解决，是实现越南政治自决的前提，越南应通过自由普选以达成民主统一。但是，十一个月以来，美国却不断地破坏日内瓦协定，企图使越南局势紧张化，使越南的停战不得稳定，使越南的统一不能实现。还在日内瓦协定刚刚签订之后，一九五四年八月六日，美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者就报道说，美国“只能期待印度支那差不多是永久地分裂下去。换句话说，美国政府并不认为停火协定所规定的（越南）全国选举能够实现”。这个记者写道，美国坚持“选举应在联合国的主持及监督下”进行，因为这样就可以使“任何进行普选的计划都将被打破”。今年四月四日出版的美国“时代”杂志更坦白承认，“美国和南越肯定要实行分治政策”，以便保持“两个越南”。为了掩护它破坏日内瓦协定，阻挠越南经过自由的普选实现统一，美国散布了诽谤越南民主共和国的各种谎言。一九五四年十一月，前美国驻南越特使柯林斯公开说，在北越“举行自由选举是不可思议的”。今年三月八日，美国国务卿杜勒斯又说：“要在北越创造可以让人们有真正选举的条件会是困难的。”他们在信口诬蔑越南民主共和国的同时，又提出显然是违反日内瓦协议的规定的所谓由联合国监督选举的论调，想使问题复杂化。
    在美国的指使和支持下，在南越已开始采取破坏越南普选的具体行动，吴庭艳集团曾经片面宣布了“选举法令”，准备在恐怖的气氛中，按照美国分裂朝鲜的蓝图，在南越制造所谓“国民议会”选举。吴庭艳集团并宣称，南越“没有义务”参加明年的全越选举，他们要用南越的单独选举“产生的政府”，来“约束”越南人民。现在，由于越南民主共和国坚持按照停战协定，协商普选，由于爱好和平的国家和人民坚决要求履行日内瓦协定的规定，据传杜勒斯也表示希望越南大选能够举行了。人们认为杜勒斯说话应该算数。在人民的压力之下说出来的话，不能用各种阻挠和破坏的阴暗行为来在实际上把它吞回去。
    与这同时，美国扶持它的代理人建立警察恐怖统治，摧残公民权利，并用武力排除异己。这也和它在南朝鲜的作法一模一样。在南朝鲜，美国把李承晚集团扶植上台以后，就竭力加强它对南朝鲜人民的暴力统治。李承晚集团在南朝鲜屠杀了无数的人民，甚至它的“国会议员”中稍有不满情绪者，也遭到迫害、逮捕和暗杀。在南越，美国正力图加强吴庭艳集团的独裁统治，以便把南越变成美国的军事基地。在越南停战后的半年内，吴庭艳集团为了压制南越居民的自由民主的要求，屠杀了八百多人，逮捕了一万三千多人。最近，美国又指使吴庭艳集团在南越制造内战以排除异己势力。“印度时报”记者雷迪在三月底访问南越后就得出一个强烈印象说：南越“正在逐步形成一种类似南朝鲜的……那种军事独裁”。
    在南朝鲜，美国通过李承晚的反动统治，利用军事“援助”，把那里变成了美国的炮灰供应地和军事桥头堡。现在，美国正在南越进行同样的活动。美国已经从法国手中接收了南越军队的“训练权”，扩大了美国军事顾问团，并以大量金钱和武器直接“援助”吴庭艳集团。根据美国今年制定的所谓柯林斯计划，美国要在年底前把南越现有部队改编为包括十四万人的陆军，并建立一支十五万人的“后备部队”和许多“地方警察部队”。柯林斯公开承认，这个计划是按照美国“在朝鲜和希腊取得的经验进行的”。
    美国这些搜罗炮灰和建立军事桥头堡的步骤，是和它的准备侵略战争的计划有关的。朝鲜的事实已经最清楚地说明了这点。一九五○年六月，在美国发动侵略朝鲜战争前，美国驻南朝鲜“军事顾问团”团长罗伯茨曾说：“军事顾问团就是一个活的证据，说明了只要有五百个久历战场的美国官兵的颕慧而紧张的‘投资’，就可以训练出十万个为你打仗的人”。现在，在南越，柯林斯也曾公开宣称，“南越军队如果予以鼓励的话，他们也将会和共产党作战”。英国“论坛报”报道说：美国在“必要时”，将“鼓励”南越当局“破坏日内瓦协定条款，并重新发动印度支那战争”。
    事情很明白，美国搞这些分裂计划和战争计划，就是想使朝鲜的悲剧和灾难在越南重演。因此，六月十日印度“德里时代”周刊发表的文章对美国在南越的干涉行为表示正当的焦虑。文章的作者写道，“政治观察家们担心，在日内瓦所完成的促成停火和在印度支那取得最后解决的良好工作，可能由于在南越发生的某种情况而遭到彻底的破坏”。
    今天，日内瓦会议关于越南停止敌对行动的协定的军事部分，已经基本实现。摆在越南人民和一切爱好和平人民面前的重大任务是：继续稳定越南的停战，坚决执行日内瓦协定的政治条款，完成越南的和平统一。越南民主共和国早已宣布它准备从一九五五年七月二十日起，同南越有代表性的负责当局举行协商会议，讨论在一九五六年七月在越南全国举行自由普选的组织问题。很显然，对于执行日内瓦协定负有义务的各个有关方面，完全应该关心和支持这个协商工作的顺利进行。在这样的时候，人们不能不特别警惕和反对美国分裂越南的阴谋。必须揭露和打破这种阴谋，必须争取使日内瓦协定全部实现。
