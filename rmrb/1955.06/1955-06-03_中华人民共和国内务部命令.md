Marriage Registration Measures
(Approved by the State Council on May 20, 1955)
(Promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on June 1, 1955)

The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates that marriage, divorce, and restoration of marriage must be registered with the local people's government. The purpose of registration is to safeguard freedom of marriage and prevent forced marriage; to safeguard the one-husband-one-wife system and prevent bigamy and concubinage; to safeguard the health of both men and women and future generations, prevent early marriage and marriages between relatives that should not occur, prevent the spread of diseases that should not be transmitted through marriage, and prevent other acts that violate the Marriage Law. To this end, these Marriage Registration Measures are formulated as follows:

1.  Marriage Registration Authorities

(1) The authorities for handling marriage registration are the street offices in cities, or the municipal people's committee or district people's committee where there are no street offices; in rural areas, they are the township or town people's committees.

(2) The authorities for handling divorce and restoration of marriage registration are the people's committees of districts under the jurisdiction of cities and the people's committees of cities not divided into districts in cities; in rural areas, they are the district offices, or the county people's committee where there are no district offices.

2.  Both men and women who marry shall personally go to the marriage registration authority in their locality to fill out a marriage application form and apply for registration. If the parties cannot fill it out, they may apply orally, and the registration staff shall fill it out on their behalf.

3.  The marriage registration authority shall carefully examine the marriage application forms of both men and women applying for marriage, and shall clarify any unclear points with the parties. When necessary, it may conduct investigations and research or require the parties to provide certificates, but it is not allowed to deliberately delay.

4.  When handling marriage registration, the marriage registration authority shall clearly explain to the parties the provisions of the Marriage Law regarding marriage and the provisions prohibiting marriage.

If the marriage registration authority finds that both men and women applying for marriage do meet the requirements of the Marriage Law regarding marriage, it shall approve the registration and issue a marriage certificate.

If it does not meet the requirements of the Marriage Law regarding marriage, the registration shall not be granted, and the reasons for not granting the registration shall be explained to the parties.

5.  Both or one of the men and women who divorce shall personally go to the marriage registration authority in their locality to fill out a divorce application form and apply for registration. If the parties cannot fill it out, they may apply orally, and the registration staff shall fill it out on their behalf. If the marriage registration authority finds that both men and women applying for divorce are indeed voluntary and have properly handled the issues of children and property, it shall approve the divorce and issue a divorce certificate. If one party files for divorce and the other party firmly refuses to divorce, or if one party avoids appearing because he/she is indeed unwilling to divorce, the marriage registration authority may transfer the matter to the local people's court for handling.

6.  If both parties to a divorce obtain a divorce mediation agreement or a divorce judgment from the court, the marriage registration authority shall no longer register or issue a divorce certificate.

7.  After a divorce, when both men and women voluntarily restore their marital relationship, they shall apply to the marriage registration authority in their locality for restoration of marriage registration. The procedures for restoration of marriage registration shall apply to the provisions for marriage registration. However, the words "restoration of marriage" must be added to the application form for reference.

When issuing the marriage certificate, the original divorce certificate shall be canceled.

8.  Both men and women applying for marriage, divorce, or restoration of marriage registration shall truthfully inform the marriage registration authority of the information that must be understood regarding marriage registration. If the marriage registration authority discovers that a party has violated the Marriage Law and deliberately conceals it, it shall criticize and educate him/her, and if the circumstances are serious, it shall request the local people's court to handle it according to law.

9.  Marriage registration staff shall perform marriage registration work with a serious and responsible attitude in accordance with the provisions of the Marriage Law and these Measures.

It is forbidden to interfere with the autonomy of marriage; it is forbidden to solicit property or engage in other illegal activities from the parties.

10. If a dispute arises between the marriage registration authority and the parties regarding registration matters that cannot be resolved by themselves, or if the parties disagree with the handling by the marriage registration authority, they may report to the people's committee at the next higher level (if the marriage registration authority is the township or town people's committee, they may report to the district office) or to the local people's court for handling.

11. Marriage certificates and divorce certificates shall be uniformly printed by the county and municipal people's committees in accordance with the provisions of the appendix to these Measures. A cost fee shall be charged for both marriage certificates and divorce certificates.

12. If the people's committees of provinces and the autonomous organs of autonomous regions find that these Measures are not applicable to marriage registration in areas inhabited by minority nationalities, they may make other flexible provisions and report them to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ethnic Affairs Commission for the record.

13. These Measures shall be promulgated for implementation by the Ministry of Internal Affairs after being approved by the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and the same shall apply when amending them.

    中华人民共和国内务部命令
    婚姻登记办法已由本部报经中华人民共和国国务院于一九五五年五月二十日批准，现予公布施行。                                            
    部长　谢觉哉                                                          
    一九五五年六月一日
    婚姻登记办法
    （一九五五年五月二十日国务院批准）
    （一九五五年六月一日内务部公布）
    中华人民共和国婚姻法规定结婚、离婚和恢复结婚都要到当地人民政府去登记，目的是为了通过登记来保障婚姻自由，防止强迫包办；保障一夫一妻制，防止重婚纳妾；保障男女双方和下一代的健康，防止早婚和亲属间不应结婚的婚姻，防止患有不应结婚的疾病传染和其他违反婚姻法的行为。为此，特制定婚姻登记办法如下：
    一、婚姻登记机关
    （一）办理结婚登记的机关，在城市是街道办事处，没有街道办事处的是市人民委员会或者是区人民委员会；在农村是乡、镇人民委员会。
    （二）办理离婚和恢复结婚登记的机关，在城市是市辖区人民委员会和不设区的市人民委员会；在农村是区公所，没有区公所的是县人民委员会。
    二、结婚的男女双方，都要亲到所在地的婚姻登记机关填写结婚申请书申请登记。如果当事人不会填写，可以用口头申请，由登记工作人员代为填写。
    三、婚姻登记机关应当认真审查结婚男女双方的结婚申请书，不清楚的地方应当向当事人问清楚。必要的时候，可以进行调查了解或者要当事人提供证件，但不许故意拖延。
    四、婚姻登记机关在办理结婚登记的时候，应当把婚姻法中关于结婚的规定和禁止结婚的规定，向当事人讲解清楚。
    经婚姻登记机关查明申请结婚的男女双方确系合于婚姻法关于结婚的规定，就应当准予登记，并发给结婚证。
    如果不合于婚姻法关于结婚的规定，则不予登记，并且应当向当事人说明不予登记的理由。
    五、离婚的男女双方或者一方，要亲到所在地的婚姻登记机关填写离婚申请书申请登记。如果当事人不会填写，可以用口头申请，由登记工作人员代为填写。经婚姻登记机关查明申请离婚的男女双方确系自愿并对于子女和财产问题确有适当处理，就应当准予离婚，并发给离婚证。一方提出离婚他方坚决不愿意离婚，或者一方确因不愿意离婚避而不到的时候，婚姻登记机关可以转请当地人民法院处理。
    六、离婚双方在法院领得离婚调解协议书或者离婚判决书以后，婚姻登记机关不再予登记和发给离婚证。
    七、离婚后，男女双方自愿恢复夫妻关系的时候，应当向所在地的婚姻登记机关申请恢复结婚登记。恢复结婚登记的手续适用结婚登记的规定。但申请书上须附注“恢复结婚”四字，以备查考。
    在发给结婚证的同时，原离婚证件应当缴销。
    八、申请结婚、离婚或者恢复结婚登记的男女双方，对于有关婚姻登记必须了解的情况，都应当忠实地告诉婚姻登记机关。婚姻登记机关如果发现当事人有违反婚姻法的行为而故意隐瞒的，应当予以批评教育，情节严重的，应当提请当地人民法院依法处理。
    九、婚姻登记工作人员，应当以严肃负责的态度，遵照婚姻法和本办法的规定，做好婚姻登记工作。
    禁止干涉婚姻自主；禁止向当事人索取财物或者其他违法行为。
    十、婚姻登记机关与当事人间，对于登记事项发生争议，自己不能解决的时候，或者当事人不同意婚姻登记机关处理的时候，都可以报上一级人民委员会（如果婚姻登记机关是乡、镇人民委员会，可以报区公所）或者当地人民法院处理。
    十一、结婚证、离婚证由县、市人民委员会依照本办法附件的规定，统一印制。结婚证和离婚证都应当收取工本费。
    十二、省人民委员会和自治区的自治机关对于少数民族聚居地区的婚姻登记，如果不适用本办法的时候，可以另作变通规定，分报内务部和民族事务委员会备案。
    十三、本办法经中华人民共和国国务院批准后，由内务部公布施行，修改时同。
