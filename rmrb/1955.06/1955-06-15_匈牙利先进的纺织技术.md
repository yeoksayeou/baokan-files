Hungary's Advanced Textile Technology

Textile Industry Ministry Research Office Deputy Director Gui Shizhi

The Hungarian Textile Testing Instrument Exhibition held in Beijing has introduced the great achievements of the Hungarian people in textile technology over the past decade to the Chinese people. It will play a good role in improving the level of textile industrial technology in our country. All of the more than 220 exhibits are brand new, precision instruments made in Hungary. These instruments fully demonstrate that, among our fraternal countries in the peace and democracy camp, the manufacturing scope of precision instruments has been greatly expanded.

This professional exhibition has aroused great interest and attention from textile technicians all over the country. After the opening of the exhibition, batches of experts, professors, technicians, model workers, and advanced workers in textile engineering from various textile industrial cities across the country, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Harbin, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Shijiazhuang, nearly 10,000 people, conducted careful professional visits and participated in special lectures.

People in the Chinese textile technology community attended the 14 technical exchange seminars hosted by the Dean of the Hungarian Textile Research Institute, Mr. Foldes, and other experts with great interest, and listened to academic reports on textile abrasion resistance tests, wool yarn fatigue, and several classifications of Chinese wool quality characteristics. This kind of planned and systematic academic report and seminar is a characteristic of this exhibition.

Although the exhibition time was very short, we have learned a lot from the exhibition, which has a certain impact and help on the improvement of textile industrial technology and the development of research and experiments in our country.

First, the inspection and testing of textile raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products is still a weak link in our country's current textile technology work. Although China's textile industry also has testing work, it is generally simple in terms of items, lacks new instruments, or the instrument equipment is incomplete and inconsistent; the inspection methods are also generally outdated and unscientific. This shows that our understanding of the importance and purpose of inspection and testing work is not clear. We only care about production, and once production is completed, we consider the task completed. We generally do not pay much attention to inspections and tests on production and the quality of finished products.

The exhibition displayed various Hungarian-made inspection and testing instruments and introduced systematic and complete inspection and testing methods, allowing us to see how the Hungarian textile industry uses highly precise and scientific instruments to test product quality, thereby ensuring that it meets the people's quality requirements for textiles. This gives us great inspiration. Textile technicians in our country feel that we should learn well from Hungary and strengthen our sense of responsibility for serving the people in our work.

Second, at present, there are still some practical difficulties in the inspection and testing of textile raw materials in our country, such as the grading of cotton, the classification and quality determination of Chinese wool, and the determination of the silk yield of silkworm cocoons, which have not yet been reasonably resolved; or, although they have been resolved, there is still a lack of mature experience. The exhibition and technical lecture reports helped us clarify the general direction for solving these problems. For example, using cotton fiber maturity to determine cotton grade is both simple and correct. This method and using cotton fiber strength to evaluate the quality of cotton are the most scientific methods.

Third, at the exhibition, we saw that the high level of development of Hungary in the scientific technology of textile testing instruments greatly enriched our knowledge in this area. For example, the inspection of cotton fiber length, fineness, strength, impurity content, and moisture content in our country is still largely based on the experience of sensory organs such as sight and touch to evaluate grades. Some factories or inspection institutions use certain testing instruments, but the equipment is very backward.

The polarized microscope for determining cotton maturity, designed according to the mature advanced experience of the Soviet Union and improved, simplifies the interference color of cotton fiber birefringence, greatly reduces artificial eye fatigue, and improves work efficiency. The "automatic cotton grader," which was further developed from this principle, raises the work of inspecting cotton fiber maturity and its grade to a higher degree of automation, eliminating the need to distinguish fiber colors and count fiber roots with the eyes. Just clamp a small number of cotton fiber samples on a glass slide, insert it into the instrument, and after three or four minutes, the percentage of mature fibers and the grade of cotton can be seen on the instrument.

Understanding cotton, understanding cotton, and mastering its characteristics in order to rationally determine its use value is a very important thing in technical work. Only when the relative content of cotton fiber length is fully understood can the effective fiber be fully utilized. And fully utilizing effective fibers is an important principle for saving raw materials. Among the exhibits, the automatic cotton fiber length tester can accurately and quickly measure the length of cotton fibers. In addition, the exhibition also displayed many new instruments for testing wool quality and flax textiles.

China's silk textiles have a history of thousands of years, but the problem of measuring the cocoon layer rate or silk yield of silkworm cocoons has not been resolved. The exhibition displayed a new instrument to solve this problem, the "silkworm cocoon firmness tester." It does not need to cut open the cocoon, nor does it need to be boiled in boiling water. It uses spring pressure to first measure the hardness of the silkworm cocoon. The tightness of the silkworm cocoon can be measured from the hardness, and then the length and quantity of silk can be deduced. The "universal loom regulator" displayed at the exhibition represents the achievements of the Hungarian textile industry in preserving machines. Using this machine not only simplifies the work of calibration, but also improves the efficiency of the cloth machine.

The Hungarian testing instruments exhibited at the exhibition are very practical and can be used not only by scientific research institutes, but also by factories and general inspection institutions. For example, the "automatic cotton grader" is small in size. When purchasing cotton from cotton farmers, it can be taken to the countryside, and as long as it is connected to the circuit, it can solve the grading of cotton on the spot and implement the policy of high-quality cotton at a good price. The operation and use of the instrument are very simple and easy to learn and master. During the exhibition, more than 20 commentators in our country basically learned the explanation and operation methods in a very short time.

During the exhibition, Hungarian experts were invited by some fiber inspection institutions, cotton processing factories, printing and dyeing factories, cotton spinning factories, and wool spinning factories in Beijing and Tianjin to personally go to the factories and enthusiastically and tirelessly help to do various experiments. They also answered various difficult questions in detail at technical seminars, provided various related technical data, and put forward specific opinions on technical cooperation between the two countries, fully demonstrating the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people jointly advancing towards the great goal of socialism.

    匈牙利先进的纺织技术
    纺织工业部研究室副主任　桂实之
    在北京展出的匈牙利纺织试验仪器展览会，向中国人民介绍了十年来匈牙利人民在纺织工业技术方面的巨大成就。它对提高我国纺织工业技术的水平将起良好的作用。全部展览品共二百二十多件，都是匈牙利制造的崭新的精密仪器。这些仪器充分显示了，在我们和平民主阵营的兄弟国家中，精密仪器的制造范围已经有了很大扩展。
    这次专业性质的展览会，引起了全国各地纺织技术人员极大的兴趣和重视。展览会开幕以后，一批一批的来自北京、上海、青岛、天津、哈尔滨、西安、武汉、石家庄等全国各个纺织工业城市的纺织工程方面的专家、教授、技术人员、劳动模范和先进工作者，将近一万人，进行了仔细的专业参观和参加了专题讲座。
    中国纺织技术界的人们怀着很大的兴趣出席了由匈牙利纺织研究院院长弗尔德士和其他专家主持的十四个技术交流的专题讲座，听了纺织品抗擦损试验，羊毛纱疲劳度，中国羊毛品质特性的几种分类等学术报告。这种有计划的系统的学术报告和座谈，是这次展览会中的一个特色。
    展览会展出时间虽然很短，但我们从展览会中学习到的东西却很多，它对我国纺织工业技术的提高和开展研究、试验工作，都有一定的影响和帮助。
    第一，纺织原料、半成品和成品的检验和试验，在我国目前纺织技术工作中还是一个薄弱环节。我国纺织工业虽也有试验工作，但一般都是项目简单，缺少新式仪器，或是仪器设备不完整、不
  一致；检验的方法一般也陈旧，不科学。这说明我们对检验和试验工作的重要性和目的性不明确，只管生产，生产完了就算完成任务，在生产上以及生产成品质量的检查和试验上大都不太讲究。
    展览会中陈列着各种匈牙利制造的检验和试验仪器，介绍了系统的完整的检验和试验方法，使我们看到，匈牙利纺织工业是怎样运用高度精密和科学的仪器，来检验产品的质量，从而保证满足人民群众对纺织品的质量要求的。这给我们以很大的启发。我国纺织技术工作者都感到应当向匈牙利很好的学习，应当在自己的工作中加强为人民服务的责任感。
    第二，目前我国对纺织原材料的检验和试验工作中，还有一些实际困难，如棉花的分等分级，中国羊毛的分类和品质测定以及蚕茧出丝率的测定等，都还没有得到合理的解决；或是虽已解决，但仍然没有成熟的经验。展览会和技术讲座报告，帮助我们弄清了解决这些问题的大体方向。例如以棉纤维成熟度来测定棉花等级，既简便又正确。用这种方法和用棉纤维强度等来评定棉花好坏都是最科学的方法。
    第三，在展览会中我们看到，匈牙利在纺织试验仪器科学技术方面的高度发展水平，大大地丰富了我们在这方面的知识。例如我国有关棉花纤维长度、细度、强度、含杂、含水等质量指标的检验，很大的部分都还是凭目力、凭手触等感官的经验，来评定等级。有些厂或检验机构采用某些试验仪器，但设备都很落后。
    根据苏联在这方面成熟的先进经验所设计并加以改进的匈牙利测定棉花成熟度的偏光显微镜，简化了棉纤维双折射的干涉色彩，大大减少了人工目力疲劳，提高了工作效率。从这个原理进一步发展的“自动棉花分级器”，把检验棉纤维成熟度及其等级的工作提到更高的自动化的程度，不再需要用目光去分辨纤维颜色，计数纤维根数，只要将很少数量棉纤维样品夹在玻璃片上，插进仪器，三、四分钟后就能在仪表上看出成熟纤维所占的百分率和棉花的等级。
    认识棉花，了解棉花，从而掌握棉花的特性，以便合理确定它的使用价值，是技术工作上一件很重要事情，只有当棉纤维长度相对含量完全弄清楚以后，才能充分利用有效纤维。而充分利用有效纤维，是节约原料的重要原则。展览品中，自动棉纤维长度试验器，能够准确迅速地测定棉纤维的长度。另外，展览品中也陈列了很多关于测验羊毛质量以及麻纺织方面的新仪器。
    我国蚕丝纺织有着几千年的历史，但对于测验蚕茧的茧层率，或产丝率问题却一直没有解决。展览会中为我们陈列了解决这个问题的新仪器，“蚕茧坚密性试验器”，它不用把茧切开，也不用沸水煮练，它利用弹簧加压，先测定蚕茧的坚硬度，从坚硬度上就能测出蚕茧的紧密度，再推算出蚕丝的长度和数量。展览会上陈列的“万能织机调节器”，代表着匈牙利纺织工业在保全机器方面的成就。使用这种机器，不但可以使校车工作简单化，而且可以把布机的效率提高。
    展览会中展出的匈牙利试验仪器实用性很强，不仅科学研究院可用，在工厂以及一般检验机构都能使用。如“自动棉花分级器”式样小巧，在向棉农收购皮棉时，提到农村，只要接上电路，就能当场解决棉花的分等分级，贯彻优棉优价的政策。仪器的操作和使用都很简便，很容易学习和掌握。展览会中我国二十多位讲解员在很短时间内大体就都学会了讲解和操作方法。
    展览期间，匈牙利专家应北京和天津的一些纤维检验机构、棉花加工工厂、印染厂、棉纺厂、毛纺厂的邀请，亲自下厂，热情地不辞劳苦地帮助做各种实验，他们还在技术座谈会上详细解答各种疑难问题，供给各种有关的技术资料，并提出有关两国技
  术合作的具体意见，充分表明了共同携手向社会主义伟大目标迈进的中匈两国人民牢不可破的友谊。
