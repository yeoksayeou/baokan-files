Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 22nd: Italian Prime Minister Segni's attempt to reorganize his cabinet has failed. On June 22nd, he formally submitted his resignation to Italian President Gronchi. Gronchi has accepted this request and has begun consultations with leaders of various political parties regarding the selection of a successor.

Segni decided to resign after the steering committee of his own Christian Democratic Party rejected his plan to reorganize the cabinet on the evening of June 21st and withdrew its support for him. The communique issued by the steering committee after its meeting on the evening of June 21st stated that Segni "has not been able to bring all the political parties back into the coalition government and parliamentary majority, and therefore has not achieved the desired clarification." The communique stated that reorganization could not be considered "a method of rebuilding understanding between the political parties in the coalition government."

The collapse of the Segni government is the result of the increasingly deepening political crisis it faces. Because it pursues domestic and foreign policies that violate national interests, it has been opposed by the broad masses of the people, and the Segni government's position has become increasingly unstable. At the same time, divisions within the coalition government and within the Christian Democratic Party have continued to deepen. For several months, Segni has made every effort to woo and negotiate between the various parties in the government alliance and the various factions within the Christian Democratic Party, attempting to achieve internal compromises to stabilize the cabinet's position, but he has not achieved his goal. Segni's plan to use cabinet reorganization as a way to overcome the difficulties on the eve of the Italian parliament's vote on the motion of no confidence in the government on June 23rd has also failed.

Reuters reported that the fall of the Segni government "will cause deep divisions within the Christian Democratic Party." According to a report by United Press International, the initial reaction of Western diplomats was one of "disappointment" and "anxiety."

    意大利谢尔巴政府垮台
    新华社二十二日讯　罗马消息：意大利总理谢尔巴改组内阁的企图失败，二十二日正式向意大利总统格隆基提出辞职。格隆基已经接受这一请求，并开始同各政党领袖商谈继任人选问题。
    谢尔巴是在他所属的天主教民主党的指导委员会二十一日晚拒绝他的改组内阁计划、撤销对他的支持以后决定辞职的。指导委员会在二十一日晚举行会议后发表的公报中说：谢尔巴“没有能使所有的政党回到联合政府和议会多数中，因而没有得到所希望的澄清”，公报说，不能认为改组是“重建联合政府中各政党之间的谅解的方法”。
    谢尔巴政府的垮台是它所面临的政治危机日益深刻化的结果。由于它奉行违反民族利益的内外政策，遭到广大人民的反对，谢尔巴政府的地位越来越不稳；同时联合政府内部和天主教民主党内部的分裂也不断加深。几个月来，谢尔巴曾经竭尽一切力量在政府联盟各党派之间和天主教民主党内部各派之间进行拉拢和谈判，企图取得内部的妥协来稳定内阁的地位，但是他并没有达到目的。谢尔巴在意大利议会六月二十三日表决对政府的不信任动议的前夕，企图用改组内阁的办法来度过难关的计划也失败了。
    路透社消息说，谢尔巴政府的倒台，“在天主教民主党内部将发生很深的分裂”。据合众社报道，西方外交家的初步反应是对此感到“失望”和“焦虑”。
