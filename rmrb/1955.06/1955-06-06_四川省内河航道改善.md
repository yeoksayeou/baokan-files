Sichuan Province's inland waterways underwent a large-scale dredging and improvement project before the start of summer. During the improvement process, 112 kilometers of wooden boat waterways were opened in Meixi, Daxi, and Guanhe, 556 kilometers of steamboat waterways and 169 kilometers of wooden boat waterways were improved, and deepening and maintenance were carried out on a total of more than 5,200 kilometers of waterways along 23 rivers including the Jialing River and the Min River. In addition, more than 1,000 navigation markers were installed.

After the improvement, the water depth of the inland rivers generally increased, the carrying capacity of ships increased by 10% to 50%, and the navigation efficiency increased by 10% to 30%. The low-water depth of the Jialing River from Hechuan to Chongqing increased by 0.2 meters, the carrying capacity of wooden boats increased from 25 tons to 40 tons, and the towing capacity of steamboats upstream also increased from 25 tons to 45 tons, maintaining year-round navigation. After the opening of the Meixi and Daxi mountain rivers in Fengjie County, wooden boats of about 2 tons can navigate, which facilitates the transportation of coal, iron, tung oil, grain and other goods along the coast, saving more than 1.05 million yuan in transportation costs every year. The opening of Guanhe in Yibin improved transportation between Sichuan and the Yunnan border, facilitating the supply of tea, salt, cloth and other goods to the Yi and Miao people in the mountainous areas. After the opening of the upstream channel of the Jialing River from Lueyang to Huangsha River, wooden boats of 3 to 6 tons can travel smoothly throughout the entire line, with a monthly transportation volume of more than 36,000 tons, which increased the supply of road construction materials and grain for the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.

    四川省内河航道改善
    四川省内河航道在入夏以前进行了一次较大规模的整治疏浚工作。整治过程中，开辟了梅溪、大溪、关河一百一十二公里的木船航道，改善了五百五十六公里轮船航道和一百六十九公里的木船航道，并在嘉陵江、岷江等二十三条河流全长五千二百多公里的航线上进行了淘深维修。另外，设立了航行标志一千多个。
    经过整治后，各内河一般都增加了水深，船只载重量提高了百分之十到五十，航行效率提高了百分之十到三十。嘉陵江合川到重庆段枯水深度提高二公寸，木船载重量由二十五吨增加到四十吨，轮船上水拖带量也由二十五吨增加到四十五吨，保持了终年通航。奉节县梅溪、大溪两条山间小河经过开辟，可通航二吨左右的木船，便利了沿岸煤、铁、桐油、粮食等物品的运输，每年可节约运费一百零五万多元。宜宾的关河整治开辟后，沟通了四川和云南边界的交通，便利了对山区彝族、苗族人民供应茶叶、盐巴、布匹等物品。嘉陵江上游略阳到黄沙河段的航道经过开辟，三到六吨的木船全线畅行，每月运量达三万六千多吨，增加了宝成铁路南段筑路器材和粮食的供应。（王立显　秦乃鼎）
