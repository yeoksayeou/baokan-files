    Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries Construction
    Great Increase in Soviet Electrical Equipment Production
    The production of electrical equipment in the Soviet Union has increased to 2.3 times the level at the beginning of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955). This was stated by Soviet Minister of Electrical Engineering Industry, Skidanenko, at a meeting of electrical equipment industry workers in Moscow.
    The staff of various enterprises producing electrical equipment are implementing the overall mechanization and automation of production in order to continuously explore new potential. This year, 57 factories across the Soviet Union are organizing assembly line workshops and conveying devices for the production of motors, generators, transformers, and household electrical appliances. In some factories, automatic operating devices for processing motor shafts have been put into production. As a result, the labor required to manufacture these parts has been reduced by half, and the labor productivity of workers has greatly improved.
  Soviet Union Holds Conference on Wind Power Utilization
    Scientists from some Soviet scientific research institutes and experimental stations, and representatives from various industrial ministries and technical agencies, recently held an All-Union conference in Moscow to discuss the utilization of wind power in the national economy.
    Soviet scientists have calculated the intensity of air currents in different regions of the Soviet Union, and designed various types of machines to convert wind power into electricity. Among these machines is a multi-blade high-speed windmill with a rotor diameter of 18 meters. Using this machine to generate electricity can produce 150,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. Dozens of wind power equipment to mechanize and electrify agricultural production are also being produced in large quantities.
    In the past two or three years, the Soviet industry will produce more than 80,000 wind power equipment, each with a power generation capacity ranging from 100 watts to 10 kilowatts.
  Vietnam Rural Areas Begin Eighth Phase of Rent Reduction Campaign
    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has begun its eighth phase of the rent reduction campaign. This phase of rent reduction covers more than 480 villages in the seven provinces of Lang Son, Bac Giang, Bac Ninh, Hung Yen, Quang Binh, Thai Binh, and Hai Duong.
    At the same time, the third phase of land reform in 466 villages in Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and other provinces is about to be completed. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is planning to carry out the fourth phase of land reform in more than 1,000 villages in Phu Tho, Vinh Phuc, Bac Ninh, and other provinces. In the third phase of land reform, which began this year, according to statistics from 307 completed villages, a total of more than 140,000 Vietnamese mu (one Vietnamese mu is approximately equal to five Chinese mu) of landlords' land, more than 12,000 head of draught cattle, and more than 91,000 pieces of farm implements were confiscated, requisitioned, and purchased, enabling more than 143,000 households and 587,000 people to be allocated land and farm implements. After the completion of the land reform, the enthusiasm of farmers for production has greatly increased, and the number of mutual aid teams and reclaimed wasteland is constantly increasing.
    According to statistics, after seven phases of rent reduction and three phases of land reform, rent has been reduced in areas with a population of 5.67 million in northern Vietnam, and land reform has been completed in areas with a population of 1.98 million.
  Poland's Achievements in Atomic Energy Research
    "New Road," the theoretical and political organ of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, published an article by M. Lesz, Vice-Chairman of the Polish State Economic Planning Commission, discussing Poland's achievements in atomic energy research.
    The article points out that Polish scientists are conducting various research work for the establishment of an atomic pile. Since the establishment of an atomic pile requires particularly pure raw materials, Polish chemists have already developed a very ingenious experimental method in 1954 to test for extremely small amounts of impurities such as boron or cadmium in the raw materials used for atomic piles.
    In order to ensure the so-called regulators that maintain chain reactions in the atomic pile are manufactured with graphite, Polish scientists have studied several methods of extracting very pure graphite from domestic raw materials. The graphite extracted by these methods can meet all the requirements of the regulators.
    In terms of generating electricity with atomic piles, geologists in Poland have recently discovered mineral deposits of chemical elements for manufacturing such atomic piles in the country. The work of thoroughly purifying them is now underway.
    Finally, the article, in discussing the important significance of Soviet assistance, said that the agreement on Soviet assistance will enable Poland to begin building its own atomic pile before the end of this year.
  Development of Bulgaria's Rubber Industry
    Bulgaria's rubber industry is developing rapidly. By the end of 1954, the output of rubber products had increased approximately three times compared to 1948.
    At present, Bulgaria's rubber industrial enterprises are able to produce rubber parts for agriculture and other machinery, battery boxes and other complex rubber products, motorcycle and bicycle tires, and the production of conveyor belts for mines has also greatly increased. The national economy's need for trapezoidal belts can be completely met by domestic production. The production of daily-use rubber products has also diversified. Now, the country is able to produce various rubber boots and rubber shoes, medical supplies and many sporting goods.
    This year, the production of Bulgaria's rubber industry will be further increased. By the end of this year, it is scheduled to begin production of five types of heavy-duty automobile rubber tires, two types of tractor tires, and other new products. The production of colored micro-cellular rubber soled shoes will also be greatly increased.
  Albania Digs Nearly Two Hundred Irrigation Canals
    Albania is vigorously building irrigation systems. Since April, four large irrigation canals have been completed. These four irrigation canals are the Viosa-Levan-Fier Irrigation Canal, the Postriba Irrigation Canal, the Lezhe-Koplik Irrigation Canal, and the Milot-Gurez Irrigation Canal, which are more than 100 kilometers long and can irrigate more than 20,000 hectares of land (each hectare is equal to 15 Chinese mu).
    Since liberation, Albania has dug a total of 193 irrigation canals, with a total length of more than 4,000 kilometers, increasing the area of irrigated land in the country to several times that before the war. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联电力工业设备产量大大增加
    苏联电力工业设备的产量已增为第五个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）开始时的两点三倍。这是苏联电工器材工业部长斯基达年科在莫斯科举行的电工器材工业工作人员会议上说的。
    生产电力工业设备的各企业工作人员，为了不断地发掘新的潜力，正实行着生产的全盘机械化和自动化。今年，全苏联有五十七个工厂正在组织生产电动机、发电机、变压器和日用电气器材的流水作业工段和传送装置。在有些工厂中，加工电动机轴的自动作业装置已经投入生产。结果使制造这些部件的劳动量减少了一半，工人的劳动生产率大大地提高了。
  苏联举行利用风力的会议
    苏联一些科学研究所和实验站的科学家、各工业部和技术机关的代表，最近在莫斯科举行了一个全苏性的会议，讨论在国民经济中利用风力的问题。
    苏联科学家们计算了苏联不同地区的气流的强度，设计了把风力变为电力的各种类型的机器。这些机器当中有一种多叶轮的快速风车，叶轮直径达十八公尺。用这种机器来发电，每年可以生产十五万瓩时的电力。还有几十种使农业生产机械化和电气化的风力设备正在大批生产中。
    在最近两三年中，苏联工业将要生产八万多个风力设备，每一个设备的发电能力从一百瓦到十瓩不等。
  越南农村开始第八期减租运动
    越南民主共和国已经开始进行第八期的减租运动。这一期实行减租的地区包括谅山、北江、北宁、兴安、广平、太平、海阳七省的四百八十多个乡。
    同时，在清化、义安等省四百六十六个乡进行的第三期土地改革即将完成。越南民主共和国政府正计划在富寿、永福、北宁、等省的一千多个乡中进行第四期土地改革。在今年开始的第三期土地改革中，根据已完成的三百零七个乡的统计，一共没收、征收、征购了地主土地十四万多越亩（一越亩约等于五市亩），一万二千多头耕牛和九万一千多件农具，使十四万三千多户、五十八万七千多人分得了土地和农具。完成土地改革后，农民的生产积极性大为提高，组织变工组和开垦荒地的数字不断在增加。
    据统计，经过七期减租和三期土地改革，在越南北部就有五百六十七万人口的地区减过租，一百九十八万人口的地区完成土地改革。
  波兰在原子能研究方面的成就
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会的理论和政治机关刊物“新路”刊载了波兰国家经济计划委员会副主席米·莱什的一篇文章，论述波兰在原子能研究方面的成就。
    文章指出：波兰的科学家们正在为建立一个原子堆而进行各种研究工作。由于建立原子堆要求特别纯粹的原料，波兰的化学家们已经在一九五四年研究出了一种非常巧妙的试验方法，以便在用于原子堆的原料中检验出极微小的硼或镉等杂质。
    为了保证用石墨来制造原子堆中维持连锁反应的所谓调节器，波兰的科学家们已经研究出从本国的原料中取出非常纯的石墨的几种办法。用这些办法取出的石墨可以满足调节器对它的一切要求。
    在用原子堆发电方面，不久以前波兰的地质学家在国内已经发现了制造这种原子堆的化学元素的矿藏。现在正在进行彻底纯化它们的工作。
    文章最后在谈到苏联的帮助的重要意义时说，关于苏联援助的协定将使波兰能够在今年年底以前开始建立自己的原子堆。
  保加利亚橡胶工业的发展
    保加利亚的橡胶工业正在迅速发展。到一九五四年年底，橡胶产品的产量约增为一九四八年的三倍。
    目前，保加利亚的橡胶工业企业已能生产用于农业和其他机器的橡胶零件、蓄电池的盒子及其他复杂橡胶制品，摩托车和自行车轮胎和矿井用运输带的生产也大大增加。国民经济对梯形引带的需要已经完全可以由本国的生产来满足。日用橡胶品的生产也多样化了。现在，国内能够生产各种胶皮靴和橡胶鞋，医药用品和许多体育用品。
    今年，保加利亚橡胶工业的生产将进一步增加。到今年年底，预定要开始生产五种重型汽车橡皮轮胎、两种拖拉机用的轮胎和其他新的产品。带有颜色的微孔橡胶鞋底的鞋的生产也将大大增加。
  阿尔巴尼亚开凿近两百条灌溉渠
    阿尔巴尼亚在大力兴修灌溉系统。自四月到现在已经有四条大灌溉渠竣工。这四条灌溉渠是维窝萨—勒范—费埃灌溉渠、波斯特里巴灌溉渠、列赫—科泼立克灌溉渠和米洛特—古列兹灌溉渠，它们共长一百多公里，可灌溉两万多公顷土地（每公顷合十五市亩）。
    自解放以来，阿尔巴尼亚共开凿了一百九十三条灌溉渠，共长四千多公里，使全国受灌溉土地的面积增加为战前的几倍。　（据新华社讯）
