    Don't Let Hu Feng Group and Other Counter-Revolutionary Elements Slip Through the Net

    We have continuously seen three batches of materials exposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group in the "People's Daily". We are more and more angry each time, and we see the true face of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group more and more clearly each time. It turns out that this group of people are counter-revolutionary elements who have close ties with the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents. Some of them are agents of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," some are reactionary officers of the Kuomintang, and some are reactionary landlords. They use literature and art as a cover, burrowing into the revolutionary ranks to carry out "heart-digging warfare," trying every possible means to undermine our revolutionary cause. Their methods are very vicious. They delve deep into the "livers" of the people, "bury themselves in work, and do a good job of establishing a mass base," luring a group of people, expressing "sincerity" and "honesty" to the Party on the surface, in order to sneak into the Party, steal Party secrets, and carry out counter-revolutionary activities. All these crimes make us extremely angry. We believe that the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is by no means just a struggle on the cultural front. The Hu Feng group is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people. Every one of us should participate in this fierce struggle. We women workers lived a poor life under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek in the past. Now we are liberated and living a happy life. We can also study in schools. Our enemies are not reconciled. What the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group is doing is trying to make our people return to the poor life of the past. We must not allow it. Their fantasy will never be realized, and their conspiracy has been exposed. We must continue to investigate all the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group. We must uproot the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and other counter-revolutionary elements from our revolutionary ranks completely and cleanly, and thoroughly eliminate them, not letting a single one slip through the net, and not allowing them to take root and sprout again and continue to undermine our revolutionary cause.
    In this struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we deeply realize the power of the people and the wisdom of the Party. We also feel the importance of strengthening political study and improving revolutionary vigilance. In the future, we will not only redouble our efforts to learn scientific knowledge, but we will also redouble our efforts to improve our political consciousness. In any situation, we must be vigilant, prevent and expose any counter-revolutionary elements.

    不让胡风集团和其他反革命分子漏网
    郝建秀　杭佩兰　常永芬  高素香  孙素珍
    我们连续在“人民日报”上看到揭露胡风反革命集团的三批材料，我们一次比一次更加气愤，一次比一次更加看清了胡风反革命集团的真正面目。原来这一帮人是和美蒋特务有密切联系的反革命分子，他们有的是“中美合作所”的特务，有的是国民党的反动军官，有的是反动的地主。他们以文艺为幌子，钻在革命队伍里，来进行“挖心战”，千方百计破坏我们的革命事业。他们的手段是十分毒辣的，他们深入到人民的“肝脏里”，“埋头工作，把群众基础弄好”，拉拢一批人，表面上对党表示“诚恳”“老实”，以便混进党内，盗窃党的机密，进行反革命的活动。这种种罪恶，使我们万分气愤。我们认为，同胡风反革命集团的斗争，决不只是文化战线上的斗争，胡风集团是我们中国人民的死敌，我们每个人都应该参加这场激烈的斗争。我们女工们，过去在蒋介石统治下，都过着贫苦的生活，现在我们解放了，生活幸福了，我们还能在学校里学习，我们的敌人是不甘心的。胡风反革命集团所干的勾当，就是企图要我们人民回到过去的贫苦生活里去，我们决不能允许。他们的幻想是永远也不会实现的，他们的阴谋被揭穿了。我们要继续追查胡风反革命集团的一切罪行，我们要把胡风反革命集团和其他反革命分子从我们革命队伍里连根拔掉，彻底干净地肃清他们，一个也不让他们漏网，不能让他们再生根发芽，继续破坏我们的革命事业。
    在这一次同胡风反革命集团的斗争中，我们深深体会到人民力量的强大，党的英明，我们更感到加强政治学习、提高革命警惕性的重要。今后，我们不但要加倍努力学习科学知识，我们要更加倍提高政治觉悟，在任何场合下，都要提高警惕，防备和揭露任何反革命分子。
