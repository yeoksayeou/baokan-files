    It is Imperative to Do a Good Job in This Year's College Enrollment Work

    The national college entrance examination work is proceeding intensely. This year is the third year of China's First Five-Year Plan, and the students enrolled this year are to supply the needs of the Second Five-Year Plan's construction. The rapid development of China's socialist construction has increased the requirements for the quality of construction talent. Therefore, the government has stipulated the policy of "guaranteeing quality and taking care of quantity" for this year's college enrollment work. It is imperative to conscientiously implement this policy and smoothly complete this year's enrollment plan.

    There are many factors that improve the quality of cadres trained by colleges and universities, and the gradual improvement of the quality of new students is one of the important factors. In the past few years, due to insufficient student sources, college enrollment work has paid more attention to quantity and not enough attention to quality. As a result, many students could not keep up with classes due to their low academic level. Many students entered school with illnesses and could not persist in their studies. Even some bad elements infiltrated the colleges and universities. These caused a serious phenomenon of high student turnover in colleges and universities. In the 1953-1954 academic year alone, more than 7,000 students nationwide suspended or dropped out of school due to illness, poor academic performance, or other reasons, accounting for 3.53 percent of the total number of students, which caused losses to the state's work of training construction talent. This year, we must resolutely correct this bias of insufficient attention to quality, appropriately improve the quality of new students, and admit new students who are politically reliable, healthy enough to persist in their studies, and academically able to keep up with classes. Only in this way can we cultivate cadres who are loyal to the cause of socialism, master advanced scientific knowledge and technological achievements, and can smoothly engage in arduous work.

    In this year's enrollment work, colleges and universities should strive to attract applications from young workers and peasants, children of workers and peasants, and young cadres on the job; however, standards should not be lowered, and admissions should not be lenient. This would not only affect the quality of cadres trained by the state, but also be of no benefit to those who enter school reluctantly. This year, it is stipulated that graduates of workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools, industrial workers in factories, mines, and farms, cadres of worker-peasant origin, demobilized construction soldiers, transferred soldiers, minority students, and overseas Chinese students should be given priority for admission when their examination scores reach the admission standards of the major they are applying for, and when their scores are the same or similar to those of general applicants. This will make it easier for them to enter their desired majors and schools, which is correct.

    Improving the quality of admitted new students cannot be unilaterally understood as only paying attention to quality and not paying attention to quantity. China's technology is backward, and colleges and universities need to supply a large number of various talents. All kinds of talents must have a certain quality, but also a certain quantity. The quantity and quality of cadre training should be correctly combined, and neither should be neglected. Due to the increase in student sources this year, especially the increase in the proportion of high school graduates in student sources, and because they have improved their political, health, and cultural and scientific knowledge to a certain extent due to the Party's education in recent years, it is fully possible to complete the requirements of ensuring quality and taking care of quantity as long as necessary measures are taken and enrollment methods are actively improved.

    In the process of enrollment work, attention should be paid to ideological education for young applicants, so that they understand the significance of colleges and universities improving the quality of admitted new students, and correctly understand the issue of college application aspirations. Young people choosing college application aspirations is choosing a specific path for serving the socialist construction cause of the motherland for a lifetime. Our social system also gives young people full possibility to realize their aspirations. Colleges and universities should take care of their college application aspirations as much as possible when admitting new students, in order to give full play to their enthusiasm for learning after entering school. It is wrong to disregard or even obliterate the college application aspirations of young people. However, on the other hand, college enrollment is planned, while the choice of college application aspirations by young people is spontaneous, and it is impossible to fully meet the overall needs of the college enrollment plan, especially under the current situation where student sources are not yet sufficient, the contradiction between the enrollment plan and student application aspirations exists. Some applicants lack understanding of the country's overall needs, and cannot realistically choose college application aspirations in combination with their specific conditions, which also exacerbates this contradiction. Applicants should be made aware that the needs of the country are a concentrated expression of the interests of all working people, and when personal college application aspirations conflict with enrollment needs, they should obey the needs of the country. Since it is unified enrollment, a certain degree of unified allocation is inevitable. Of course, colleges and universities should take care of the college application aspirations of young people as much as possible. For young people whose politics, health, and examination scores all meet the requirements of the major and school they are applying for, they should be admitted according to their aspirations; for those who meet the conditions but cannot be admitted according to their desired major and school, they should be carefully admitted and allocated in combination with the specific circumstances of each applicant, fully considering the possibility of their learning after entering school. In addition, applicants should also be informed that in order to adapt to the needs of national economic construction and gradually change the unreasonable distribution of schools left over from old China, the enrollment tasks of inland colleges and universities have increased this year, and young people are welcome to apply to inland schools.

    Now the date of the college entrance examination is approaching. In order to do a good job in this year's college enrollment work, all relevant departments should, in accordance with the "Decision on Ensuring the Completion of the 1954 National College Enrollment Plan" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to party committees at all levels on May 20, 1954, expand student sources and mobilize young people who meet the application conditions to apply for colleges and universities. This year, all high school graduates and graduates of workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools should apply for colleges and universities. The relevant departments of the Central Government have decided to select and send outstanding graduates of secondary vocational schools, primary school teachers, and professional cadres on the job who apply for colleges and universities, and they should ensure the quality and quantity of their transfers. For young cadres on the job who apply, their agencies should give them active support and enthusiastic help if they meet the conditions. At the same time, demobilized construction soldiers, transferred soldiers, returned overseas Chinese students, and social educated youth who meet the application conditions are also welcome to apply in order to expand the source of candidates and expand the scope of admission choices.

    The abolition of the large administrative region institutions, which served as the link for the unified enrollment organization of colleges and universities in the past few years, has an impact on this year's enrollment work. Because the enrollment work cannot be done entirely by the colleges and universities themselves, the provinces and cities must strengthen their leadership over the college enrollment work. On the other hand, due to the imbalance between the sources of students in the provinces and cities and the enrollment tasks of colleges and universities, and the distribution of colleges and universities in the provinces and cities is not completely rational, it is necessary to carry out necessary allocation basically within the scope of the original large administrative regions. This particularly requires the education departments of Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hubei, and Liaoning provinces and the Shanghai Higher Education Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Higher Education to organize and lead the enrollment institutions within the scope of the original large administrative regions to undertake this work. Relevant departments of provinces and cities and the Communist Youth League organizations should actively cooperate.

    All colleges and universities across the country, under the leadership of relevant departments of provinces and cities, should be fully responsible for the enrollment work. Recruiting new students is the responsibility of every college and university, and the school should be responsible for handling it itself. The current unified enrollment is only a transitional measure under certain periods and certain conditions. It is the normal track for colleges and universities to organize enrollment separately; in the future, the enrollment methods should be improved, and colleges and universities should gradually enroll students separately. This year, with the tight schedule and the relatively lack of experience in organizing college enrollment work in the provinces and cities, colleges and universities across the country especially need to actively participate in the enrollment work. The president, dean, or above-level responsible cadres of the school should take the initiative to participate in the leadership of the enrollment work; the school is also responsible for selecting competent cadres to participate in various tasks according to the needs of the enrollment agencies at all levels, in order to accumulate experience and train cadres, and create conditions for separate enrollment by each school in the future.

    College enrollment work is a heavy and meticulous organizational work that requires close cooperation and coordinated action from all relevant departments. This year, the state has stricter requirements for college enrollment, and the time is tight, and the leadership of provinces and cities lacks experience. Party committees at all levels should pay special attention to this work during this period, and strengthen leadership and supervision. Local education administrative departments, Communist Youth League organizations, and colleges and universities across the country should closely cooperate and strive to improve the quality of admitted new students and achieve this year's college enrollment plan.

### 必须做好今年高等学校的招生工作

    必须做好今年高等学校的招生工作
  全国高等学校的招考新生工作正在紧张进行。今年是我国执行第一个五年计划的第三年，今年招收的学生，是供应第二个五年计划建设需要的。我国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，提高了对于建设人才的质量的要求，所以政府对今年高等学校的招生工作，规定了“保证质量，照顾数量”的方针；必须认真执行这一方针，顺利地完成今年的招生工作计划。
    提高高等学校培养干部质量的因素很多，新生质量的逐步提高，是重要因素之一。过去几年在学生来源不足的情况下，高等学校的招生工作比较多的照顾了数量，而对于质量则注意不够，以致有不少学生由于学科程度过低，学习跟不上班，有不少学生带病入学，不能坚持学习，甚至有个别坏分子混入了高等学校，这些就造成了高等学校学生流动率较大的严重现象。仅一九五三——一九五四年度因患病、学习成绩过差或其他原因而休学、退学的学生，全国就有七千余人，占在校学生总数百分之三点五三，使国家培养建设人才的工作受到了损失。今年应该坚决纠正这种对质量注意不够的偏向，适当地提高新生质量，录取政治上可靠、身体健康能坚持学习、学业能跟上班的新生入学。只有这样，才能够培养出忠实于社会主义事业，掌握先进的科学知识和技术成就，能顺利地从事艰巨工作的干部。
    在今年的招生工作中，高等学校应该努力吸收工农青年、工农子女和在职青年干部报考；但不应当降低标准，不能从宽录取。因为这不仅会影响国家培养干部的质量，而且对勉强入学的人也没有好处。今年规定工农速成中学毕业生，工厂、矿山、农场等产业部门的产业工人，工农子女、工农成份的干部，复员建设军人、转业军人，少数民族学生，华侨学生的报考者，当其考试成绩达到所报考专业的录取标准，在与一般报考青年成绩相同或相近时，应优先录取，使其易于进入志愿的专业和学校，这是正确的。
    提高录取新生的质量，不能被片面地理解为只注意质量不注意数量。我国技术落后，需要高等学校大量地供应各种人才；不论那一种人才，都要有一定的质量，同时也要有一定的数量，应当使培养干部的数量和质量正确地结合起来，不能偏废。由于今年学生来源增加，特别是高中毕业生在学生来源中的比重增大，而他们由于几年来党的教育，政治、健康和文化科学知识水平都有一定程度的提高，只要采取必要措施，积极改善招生办法，是有充分可能来完成保证质量，照顾数量的要求的。
    在招生工作过程中，要注意对报考的青年进行思想教育，使他们了解高等学校提高录取新生质量的意义，并正确地认识升学志愿问题。青年选择升学志愿，是选择一生为祖国社会主义建设事业服务的具体道路。我们的社会制度，也给予了青年实现他们志愿的充分可能。高等学校在录取新生的时候，应该尽可能地照顾他们的升学志愿，以发挥他们入学后学习的积极性。不照顾甚至抹煞青年的升学志愿，是不对的。但另一方面，高等学校招生是有计划的，而报考的青年选择升学志愿是自发的，不可能完全符合高等学校招生计划的全面需要，特别在目前学生来源还不充分的情况下，招生计划和学生报考志愿的矛盾是存在的。部分报考的青年对国家的全面需要缺乏了解，不能结合自己的具体条件实事求是地选择升学志愿，也加重了这个矛盾。应该使报考的青年知道，国家的需要是全体劳动人民利益的集中表现，当个人升学志愿同招生需要发生矛盾的时候，应该服从国家的需要。既是统一招生，在一定程度上的统一调配就是不可避免的。当然，高等学校应该尽可能地照顾青年的升学志愿，对于政治、健康、考试成绩都够所报考志愿专业和学校的青年，应该按照他们的志愿来录取；对于条件合格而不能按志愿专业和学校录取的，应该结合每个报考青年的具体情况，充分考虑到他们入学后学习的可能性，来慎重地录取和分配。此外，还应该向报考的青年说明，为着适应国家经济建设需要，逐步改变旧中国遗留下来的学校地区分布不合理的状况，今年内地高等学校招生任务增加，欢迎青年报考内地的学校。
    现在高等学校招生考试的日期已经迫近。为了做好今年高等学校的招生工作，各有关部门应当根据中共中央一九五四年五月二十日向各级党委发出的“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”，扩大学生来源，动员合乎报考条件的青年，报考高等学校。今年高中毕业生和工农速成中学毕业生应该全部报考高等学校。中央各有关部门已经决定选送报考高等学校的中等专业学校的优秀毕业生、小学教师、在职专业干部，应该保证质量、保证数量地如数调足。对于投考的在职青年干部，凡是合乎条件的，他们的所在机关应该予以积极的支持和热情的帮助。同时，也要欢迎合乎报考条件的复员建设军人、转业军人、归国华侨学生和社会知识青年报考，以扩大考生来源，扩大录取选择的余地。
    作为以往几年高等学校统一招生组织工作纽带的大行政区机构的撤销，对今年招生工作是有影响的。因为招生工作不能全部由高等学校自己去做，各省、市必须加强对于高等学校招生工作的领导。另一方面，由于各省、市学生来源和高等学校的招生任务不平衡，各省、市高等学校的分布也不完全合理，又必须基本上以原来的大行政区为范围，进行必要的调配。这就特别要求陕西、四川、湖北、辽宁四省教育厅和高等教育部上海高等教育管理局组织和领导原来大行政区范围内的招生机构，以担负这一工作。省、市的有关部门和青年团组织，应该予以积极配合。
    全国高等学校，在省、市有关部门领导之下，要对招生工作全面负责。招考新生是每一所高等学校的责任，应该由学校自己负责办理。现时的统一招生，只是在一定时期、一定条件下的过渡办法。各校自行单独组织招生是高等学校招生的正常轨道；今后应该改善招生办法，逐步由各校单独招生。今年在时间紧迫，省、市组织高等学校招生工作比较缺乏经验的情况下，全国高等学校尤其需要积极参加招生工作。学校的校长、院长或教务长以上的负责干部，应主动参加招生的领导工作；学校还有责任根据各级招生机构的需要，选派称职的干部参加各项工作，以便积累经验，培养干部，为以后各校单独招生创造条件。
    高等学校招生工作是繁重细致的组织工作，须要各有关部门密切配合，协同动作。今年国家对于高等学校招生的要求比较严格，而时间紧迫，省、市领导比较缺乏经验，各地党委在这个时期应该特别重视这件工作，加强领导和监督。各地教育行政部门、青年团组织、全国高等学校应该密切配合，为提高录取新生质量，实现今年高等学校的招生计划而努力。
