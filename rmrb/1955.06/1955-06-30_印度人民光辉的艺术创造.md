    The world echoes with such a voice: The people of India and China are brothers. A new dawn appears on the earth, the sky is full of dawn. ... No one can sever our ancient brotherhood, and we will never be separated in the future. We, the warriors of peace, advance hand in hand, wholeheartedly and firmly fighting against the warmongers. --Indo-China Friendship Song

    The visit and performance of the Indian Cultural Delegation headed by Mr. Anil Kumar Chanda as envoys of friendship from the Indian people is an event of great significance in our people's cultural life, and we welcome their arrival with immense joy.

    The several performances given by this Indian Cultural Delegation, composed of famous Indian dancers and musicians, in Beijing have left us with extremely deep and vivid impressions. The beautiful and moving music and colorful dances performed by the artists fully demonstrate the genius and wisdom and rich creativity of the Indian people, and embody the spiritual outlook of the peace-loving, brave, and tenacious Indian people.

    We deeply admire the glorious artistic achievements of the Indian people with their long history and excellent traditions. Here I will only talk about my experiences in music.

    The chorus "Indo-China Friendship Song" is an inspiring program. The singing of the lead singer Biswas and the choir is expressive and full of emotion, and is very infectious. Especially when decorative phrases with praising emotions appear: it gives people a profound and moving feeling.

    Paluskar's "Rain Song" is also an extremely beautiful program. The singer used his superb vocal skills to depict the scenes of dark clouds, thunder and lightning, and the joyful emotions of the spring breeze bringing sweet rain. Here, the singing and accompaniment instruments reached a high degree of unity, and they were combined so naturally and closely that it was seamless. With the singer's rich imagination and dramatic expression, the audience was also brought into the realm of poetry.

    At the performance gala, we also heard Biswas singing "Tagore's Ode", which was created by the great Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore combined the best parts of Indian folk music and classical music to enrich the expressive power of poetry and music. In India, it is considered to be his outstanding contribution to Indian contemporary music. In Biswas's full singing, we heard Tagore's beautiful and sincere musical creations.

    "Punjab Song" reflects the patriotic feelings of the Indian people who are "ready to sacrifice everything for the motherland at any time" with its simple and solid melody. The rough singing and singing and dancing performance form is strong and powerful.

    The instrumental program is also very outstanding and characteristic. Many Indian stringed instruments, such as the Sarod, Sitar, and Sarangi, have many resonating strings. When the main strings of these instruments sound, many resonating strings also vibrate at the same time, thus enriching the color of the instruments. It is only natural that the sitar soloist Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan and the sarod soloist Radhika Mohan Maitra were warmly welcomed by the audience at the performance. Each of them used their superb skills, lyrical techniques, and delicate expressions to play the instruments as if they were singing, moving people's hearts.

    The instrumental ensemble has rich expressive power, especially with the addition of tuned drums arranged in a certain scale (sometimes used for melodic progressions), which is very characteristic. Although the instrumental ensemble, as the program says, is still in the experimental stage in India, it can be seen that it has great development prospects.

    The musical programs performed by the Indian Cultural Delegation have distinct national characteristics, but they are also very cordial to us. The reason, I think, is very simple. As early as thousands of years ago, the people of China and India began close cultural exchanges. This exchange had a certain degree of influence on the development of music in the two countries, and enriched their respective musical cultures, so that we can still find signs of mutual influence today. For example, in the accompaniment music of the Bharata dance "Tillana", we found a melody similar to the tune of Chinese folk songs:

    And the Indian singer Paluskar, after listening to our Mongolian folk songs, also felt that its tone was similar to that of South Indian folk songs.

    Of course, this sense of intimacy between the people of our two countries is not only due to some similarities in music. The main reason is that the music expresses the common aspirations of the people of our two countries for happiness and a peaceful life.

    We thank the Indian Cultural Delegation for their excellent performance, which gave us the opportunity to appreciate and learn from the glorious artistic creations of the Indian people. We believe that the visit and performance of the Indian Cultural Delegation in our country will surely make an important contribution to enhancing the understanding and friendship between the people of China and India, and thus benefit the common cause of defending world peace.

    印度人民光辉的艺术创造
    中国音乐家协会副秘书长　孙慎
    世界各个角落都响着这样的声音：印中人民是兄弟。新的黎明出现在地球上，天空满布着晨曦。………没有人能够隔断我们古老的兄弟情谊，在将来我们也永不分离。我们，和平战士携手前进，一心一意地，坚定地同战争贩子斗争。——印中友好歌
    以阿尼尔·库马尔·钱达先生为首的印度文化代表团作为印度人民友谊的使者来到我国进行访问演出，这是我国人民文化生活中具有重要意义的事件，我们怀着无比的喜悦欢迎他们的到来。
    这个由印度著名舞蹈家和音乐家所组成的印度文化代表团在北京的几场演出，给我们留下极其深刻和鲜明的印象。艺术家们所表演的优美动人的音乐和美丽多采的舞蹈，充分地显示了印度人民的天才智慧和丰富创造，体现了爱好和平、勇敢坚韧的印度人民的精神面貌。
    我们非常欣佩印度人民的有着悠久历史和优秀传统的光辉艺术成就。这里仅就音乐方面谈谈我的体会。
    合唱“印中友好歌”是一个令人鼓舞的节目。领唱者毕斯瓦斯和歌队的歌声是富有表情和情绪充沛的，非常有感染力。特别是有着歌颂情绪的装饰乐句出现的时候：更予人以意味深长和动人心弦的感觉。
    帕卢斯卡尔的“雨之歌”，也是一个极其美妙的节目。演唱者以其娴熟的声乐技巧，描绘了阴云四起、雷电闪鸣的情景以及春风带来甘雨的欢乐情绪，在这里歌声和伴奏乐器达到了高度的一致，它们结合得那样自然、紧密，简直天衣无缝。随着演唱者的丰富想像和戏剧性的表达，听众也被带入了诗的境界。
    在演出晚会上我们还听到了毕斯瓦斯演唱的
  “泰戈尔的颂歌”，这是印度大诗人拉宾德拉·泰戈尔创作的音乐，泰戈尔把印度民间音乐和古典音乐的最好部分结合起来，丰富了诗歌和音乐的表现能力。在印度被认为是他对印度当代音乐方面的卓越贡献。在毕斯瓦斯的丰满的歌声中我们听到了优美真挚的泰戈尔的音乐创作。
      “旁遮普之歌”以朴素、坚实的旋律，反映了印度人民“随时准备为祖国牺牲一切”的爱国主义感情。粗犷的歌声和载歌载舞的演唱形式是健壮有力的。
    器乐节目也是非常杰出和具有特色的。印度好些弦乐器如瑟路达、锡达尔、萨朗基等都有许多共鸣的弦。在这些乐器的主要琴弦发声的时候，许多共鸣弦也同时随着震响，因之丰富了乐器的色彩。锡达尔独奏家阿卜杜勒·哈利姆·贾法尔·康恩和瑟路达独奏家拉迪卡·莫汉·马伊特拉在演出会上受到听众的热烈欢迎是很自然的。他们各以其纯熟的技巧，抒情的手法，和细致的表情把乐器演奏得像歌唱一样地打动人心。
    乐器合奏具有丰富的表现能力，特别是在其中加入了按一定音阶排列的定音鼓（有时用它来作旋律式的进行），很有特色。虽然乐器合奏如节目单所说在印度还在实验阶段，但已可以看出是有远大的发展前途的了。
    印度文化代表团所演出的音乐节目，具有鲜明的民族色彩，但对于我们又是非常亲切的。其原因我想是很简单的，远在几千年前，中印两国人民就开始了亲密的文化交流关系，这种交流便在两国音乐的发展上发生某种程度的影响，并丰富了各自的音乐文化，以致在今天我们还可以发现互相影响的迹象。例如在婆罗多舞“提拉纳”的伴唱音乐中，我们发现了近似中国民歌音调的旋律：
    而印度歌唱家帕卢斯卡尔在听了我们的蒙古民歌后，也觉得它和印度南方民歌的音调相似。
    当然，我们两国人民的这种亲切之感，并不仅仅由于音乐上的某种近似。主要的，还由于在音乐上表达了我们两国人民对于幸福、对于和平生活的共同愿望。
    我们感谢印度文化代表团的优秀表演，使我们获得欣赏和学习印度人民光辉的艺术创造的机会。我们相信，印度文化代表团在我国的访问演出，一定会对增进中印两国人民之间的了解和友谊，作出重要的贡献，从而有益于保卫世界和平的共同事业。
