Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 16th. Jilin Province public security organs recently arrested a group of escaped counter-revolutionary elements hiding in the forestry industry sector according to law.

The arrested criminals were mostly backbone counter-revolutionary elements with numerous crimes and blood debts. The criminal Zheng Dianming alone had six lives on his hands; the criminal Dong Wendian had killed twenty-one Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and people. In addition, there were counter-revolutionary elements such as Li Zhi'an, who frequently fabricated rumors and incited the masses to carry out sabotage activities.

These counter-revolutionary elements took advantage of the lax examination when our forestry industry sector recruited workers and sneaked in. They all changed their names and made clever disguises. For example, the counter-revolutionary element Tao Longchang, who had once captured and killed our revolutionary cadres, shaved his head and took slimming medicine to change his appearance after entering the forest area. They pretended to be "progressive," some infiltrated the Communist Party and Communist Youth League organizations, and some became cadres. Zheng Dianming used the alias Zhang Youqian and fraudulently obtained the position of vice chairman of a trade union unit. These heinous counter-revolutionary elements also used their powers to carry out arson, subvert trains, and other sabotage activities. For example, a materials warehouse was set on fire by these counter-revolutionary elements, causing the state to lose 70,000 yuan in wealth. The local people demand that the government severely punish these heinous counter-revolutionary elements.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 16th. With the active assistance of the masses, public security organs in various counties of Zhangjiakou District, Hebei Province, recently uncovered six cases of reactionary secret societies carrying out counter-revolutionary activities. The criminals in these cases mostly hid after the People's Government explicitly banned reactionary secret society organizations, and then restored reactionary organizations, developed followers, and continued to plot various sabotage activities as counter-revolutionary elements.

The names of these reactionary secret society organizations that were uncovered are "Great Buddhism," "Mingyan Sect," "Principle of Heaven," "Yiguandao," and "Central Dao." These reactionary organizations privately established "national titles," proclaimed emperors and appointed officials, and carried out various counter-revolutionary activities. Li Zhu, the leader of "Yiguandao" in Shangdu County, proclaimed himself "emperor," established a "national title," and formulated a "national flag." Ma Xuan, the leader of "Central Dao," also proclaimed himself "emperor," and also appointed a "crown prince" (Ma Xuan's son) and "three palaces and six courts," and established his own "national title." These reactionary secret society organizations have very strict internal control. All followers who have been developed into the sect must "confess" and make "vows," and some implement decentralized leadership. Their methods of developing organizations and conducting activities are very secretive. They use open occupations as a cover, or build underground caves and dark rooms for long-term concealment. Twenty-seven underground caves and dark rooms used by these reactionary organizations for secret activities have been discovered. In Zhang Yiliang Village, Shangdu County, a large cave that can accommodate more than 30 people was cleared out. There was also an iron furnace in the cave, ready to make murder weapons. These lurking leaders and their henchmen often conduct reactionary activities such as "liaison," "connecting lines," and "passing on altar instructions" by means of visiting relatives and friends, doing business, transportation, seeing doctors, and fortune-telling.

These counter-revolutionary elements carried out various sabotage activities against agricultural production cooperatives. They took advantage of the complacency of some cadres or the masses to infiltrate agricultural production cooperatives. In Shangdu County, five leaders of the sect infiltrated an agricultural production cooperative. These leaders restored more than 30 followers in the cooperative and attempted to undermine the cooperative by poisoning livestock and other means in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary goal of sabotaging the socialist transformation cause. In the seventh district of Zhangbei County, more than 30 altar masters infiltrated six agricultural production cooperatives. Two altar masters also became directors of the cooperative, one became the deputy director, and one became the accountant. They spread rumors and slandered the policies of the People's Government. In Xuanhua, Yanqing, Zhangbei and other counties, it was also found that Yiguandao leaders and followers organized fake mutual aid groups and cooperatives. For example, in Nanrangdi Village, Baimiaotan Township, Zhangbei County, there was an agricultural production cooperative composed of twelve Yiguandao leaders and followers. The director of the cooperative was a preacher with current counter-revolutionary activities.

Now, this group of counter-revolutionary elements has been publicly tried by the court. Some have been sentenced to death according to law, some have been sentenced to imprisonment, and those with lighter crimes have been handed over to the masses for control.

    吉林逮捕一批潜伏的反革命分子
    张家口专区破获会道门的反革命活动案件
    新华社长春十六日电　吉林省公安机关最近依法逮捕了一批潜伏在森林工业部门中的漏网的反革命分子。
    被逮捕的这些罪犯大都是罪恶多端、血债累累的反革命骨干分子。罪犯郑殿铭一人便有六条人命血债；罪犯董文典曾经杀害过共产党员、青年团员和人民群众二十一人。另外，还有经常制造谣言、煽动群众进行破坏活动的反革命分子李治安等六人。
    这些反革命分子是乘我森林工业部门招募工人时审查不严趁机混入的。他们都更改姓名并进行了巧妙的伪装。如曾经捕杀我革命干部的反革命分子陶隆长，混进林区后就剃光头，吃消瘦药，改变了自己的容貌。他们伪装“进步”，有的混入到共产党、青年团组织内，有的当了干部。郑殿铭化名为张友潜，骗取了某单位工会副主席的职务。这些罪大恶极的反革命分子还曾经利用职权，进行放火、颠覆列车以及其他各种破坏活动。例如有一个物资仓库就曾经被这些反革命分子纵火烧掉，使国家损失七万元财富。对于这些罪大恶极的反革命分子，当地人民要求政府给以严厉的惩罚。
    新华社保定十六日电　河北省张家口专区各县公安机关在群众的积极协助下，最近破获了六起反动会道门进行反革命活动的案件。这些案件的罪犯大都是在人民政府明令取缔反动会道门组织以后隐蔽起来，又恢复反动组织，发展道徒，继续阴谋进行各种破坏活动的反革命分子。
    被破获的这些反动会道门组织的名称是“大佛教”、“明眼教”、“原理天道”、“一贯道”、“中央道”。这些反动组织私立“国号”，称帝封官，进行各种反革命活动。商都县“一贯道”道首李柱自封“皇帝”，并立了“国号”，制定了“国旗”。“中央道”大道首马选也自封“皇帝”，还封有“皇太子”（马选的儿子）和“三宫六院”，自立了“国号”。这些反动会道门组织内部控制很严，凡是已被发展入道的道徒，都要“忏悔”，并立下“誓愿”，有的实行分片领导。它们发展组织进行活动的方法十分诡密，都是以公开职业为掩护，或造地洞、暗室长期隐蔽。已发现这些反动组织借以进行秘密活动的地洞、暗室有二十七处。在商都县张义良村曾清查出一个可容三十多人的大地洞，洞内还设有打铁炉，准备制作杀人凶器。这些潜伏道首和他的爪牙还时常以走亲访友、行商、运输、看病、算命等方法，进行“串连”、“接线”、“传递坛训”等反动活动。
    这些反革命分子对农业生产合作社进行了各种破坏活动。他们利用当地某些干部或群众的麻痹大意，钻进了农业生产合作社。商都县有一个农业生产合作社内被混入五个道首，这些道首在社内恢复道徒三十多人，他们以毒害牲畜等手段企图搞垮合作社，以达到他们破坏社会主义改造事业的反革命目的。张北县七区六个农业生产合作社就混入坛主三十多人，有两个坛主还当了社长，一个当了副社长，一个当了会计。他们散布谣言，污蔑人民政府的政策。在宣化、延庆、张北等县还发现有一贯道道首和道徒组织假的互助组和合作社。如张北县白庙滩乡南壤底村有十二户一贯道道首和道徒组成的一个农业生产合作社，社长是有现行反革命活动的点传师。
    现在，这批反革命分子已由法院公开地进行了审理，有的依法被判处死刑，有的被判处徒刑，犯罪较轻的交给群众管制。
