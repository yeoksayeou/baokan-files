    Recently, we have received many letters from demobilized construction soldiers, farmers, social intellectuals, on-the-job cadres, and students, suggesting that the government should launch immigration and land reclamation projects, and requesting solutions to the specific problems of them going to the border areas of the motherland to reclaim wasteland and participate in labor production, fully expressing their enthusiasm for the construction of the motherland.

    Immigration and land reclamation is a major undertaking that must be carried out in our country's economic construction. It plays a significant role in developing agricultural production and increasing grain output. In the northeast, northwest, and southwest regions of our country, land is vast and sparsely populated, and the soil is fertile, making it very suitable for immigration and land reclamation. Therefore, the suggestion of immigration and land reclamation is correct. The state has begun to pay attention to this work and is in the process of trial implementation. For example, this spring, Shandong Province, in order to help the Northeast develop agricultural production and solve the difficulties of people's production and life in the Yellow River riverbed, flood storage areas, and poor mountainous areas of the province, relocated more than 12,000 households, a total of more than 55,000 people, to Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and other places to participate in agricultural production. This kind of immigration measure can regulate the labor force and land in rural areas inside and outside the pass and help farmers in production. This work will continue to be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner in the future.

    However, large-scale immigration and land reclamation is a complex, meticulous, and arduous task, and full preparations must be made in all aspects beforehand, and it must not be done hastily. Therefore, large-scale immigration and land reclamation can only be carried out in a planned and led manner, adapting to the needs of the country and based on possible conditions. It is difficult to carry out large-scale immigration and land reclamation on a large scale at present.

    Many people have written letters requesting to participate in land reclamation work, and this enthusiasm is commendable. We hope that everyone who has the aspiration to develop the frontier will consider their aspirations from the current actual situation, under the general spirit of the state's advocacy and encouragement of immigration work. If the local people's committee has not yet organized immigration work, the enthusiasm for developing the border areas of the motherland should be used in the current production and work at their posts, and do not be too hasty, so as not to be uneasy about the work at the existing production posts, or blindly sell things, borrow travel expenses, and prepare to leave. Otherwise, it will not only affect production, but also increase avoidable difficulties. As for those who have relatives and friends to rely on in sparsely populated areas, and who can indeed participate in agricultural production there, they can go there on their own.

### 关于移民到边疆进行开垦的问题

    关于移民到边疆进行开垦的问题
    最近我们收到不少复员建设军人、农民、社会知识青年、在职干部和学生的来信，建议政府举办移民垦荒事业，并要求解决他们到祖国边疆去开垦荒地，参加劳动生产的具体问题，充分表现了他们关怀祖国建设事业的热情。
    移民垦荒是我们国家经济建设当中必须进行的一项重大事业。它对发展农业生产，增加粮食产量，有很大作用。在我国东北、西北、西南地区，地广人稀，土地肥沃，很适宜于移民垦荒。因此，建议移民垦荒的意见是正确的。现在国家已开始重视这一工作，并正在着手进行试办。例如今春山东省为了帮助东北发展农业生产和解决本省黄河河床上、蓄洪区和贫瘠山区人民生产生活的困难，迁移一万二千多户共五万五千多人，到吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古自治区等地，参加农业生产。这种移民措施，可以调节关内外农村的劳力、土地，扶助农民生产。这个工作今后将要有计划、有步骤地继续举办下去。
    但是，大规模地移民垦荒，是一件复杂、细致而繁重的工作，必须事先做好各方面的充分准备，决不能草率从事。因此，大规模地移民垦荒事业，只能有计划、有领导地进行，既要适应国家的需要，又要根据可能的条件。目前要急于大规模地进行移民垦荒是有困难的。
    许多人来信要求参加垦荒工作，这种热情是可贵的。我们希望每个具有开垦边疆志愿的人在国家提倡和鼓励移民工作的总的精神下，从当前实际情况出发，考虑自己的志愿。如果当地人民委员会还没有组织移民工作，应当把开垦祖国边疆的热情，用在目前的生产和所在岗位的工作上，不要过急，以致不安于现有生产岗位的工作，或是盲目地卖东西，借路费，准备出发。否则，不但会影响生产，并且会增加可以避免的困难。至于在地广人稀的地区有亲友可投的，到那里又确实能够参加农业生产的，都可以自行前去。
