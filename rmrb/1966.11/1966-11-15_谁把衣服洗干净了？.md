We are students from Nanjing who came to Beijing to participate in the "revolutionary linking-up" activities. We were assigned to stay at the reception center of the Beijing Brick and Tile Factory. The workers, cadres, and family members of the factory were all very enthusiastic and took care of us in every possible way. Among them, there was one outstanding family member of a model worker who left a deep impression on us.

In the morning, the students went out for the "revolutionary linking-up" activities. This family member came to our dormitory and saw some dirty clothes and socks. She took them back, washed them clean, folded them neatly, and even mended the torn socks. Without saying a word, she returned them to the dormitory, locked the door, and left. In the evening, when the students returned, they found their clothes and socks clean and neatly folded. They asked her about it, but she still did not admit that she had done it! The students were very moved by this incident and said: We must learn from this outstanding family member of a model worker.

    谁把衣服洗干净了？
    我们是从南京来北京串连的学生，被分配住在北京市砖瓦总厂的接待站里。工厂的职工、干部和家属们都非常热情，对我们照料得无微不至。其中有一位五好职工家属，给我们印象最深。
    上午，同学们外出串连去了。这位家属同志来到宿舍里，看到有一些脏衣服和脏袜子，她就拿了回去，洗得干干净净，摺得平平整整，把破袜子还补好，不声不响地送回宿舍，锁上门就走了。晚上，同学们回来，发现衣服袜子洗得干干净净，就问她怎么回事，她还不肯承认是自己做的呢！同学们对这件事非常感动，说：我们一定要好好向这位五好职工家属学习。
