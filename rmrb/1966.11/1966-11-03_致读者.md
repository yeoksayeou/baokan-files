In the midst of the tumultuous Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the entire Party and the people of the nation are enthusiastically responding to the call of Comrade Lin Biao to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights. In response to the broad readership's request, in addition to ensuring that all propaganda is infused with the red line of Mao Zedong Thought, and strengthening the promotion of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works across all pages of the newspaper, we will also dedicate the third page to publishing the experiences and insights of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and Red Guards in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, particularly in the current Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. This will include sharing and exchanging experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works, publishing guidance materials for studying Chairman Mao's works, and articles that analyze practical and ideological issues using Mao Zedong Thought.

We eagerly hope that all readers will write to us with your insights, experiences, questions, and opinions on studying Chairman Mao's works. Let us all work together to promote the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Regarding submissions on studying Chairman Mao's works, please send them to the Propaganda Department for Studying Chairman Mao's Works at this newspaper.
