Mao Zedong Thought is a great thought, and the Chinese people, relying on Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved one victory after another.

	A Burmese writer said: The Chinese people, by mastering missile and nuclear weapons, have made a great contribution to world peace. This is a heavy blow to American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism's monopoly on nuclear weapons, and it is also a great encouragement to all the peoples of the world who are fighting against American aggression and for national liberation.

A Nepalese farmer said, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world. China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has achieved such great victories, this is our pride." A Nepalese worker said: "We love Chairman Mao because Chairman Mao is the red sun of the East. China has Chairman Mao, so China has won one great victory after another."

	A Nepalese student named Shrestha said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "China's successful missile and nuclear weapons test is a victory of the great thought of the world's great leader, Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought is the most important spiritual nuclear weapon of the revolutionary peoples of the world."
