The masses lack firewood for cooking, and Comrade Jie Jianbao volunteers his rest time to help the masses gather firewood. This is a good deed. However, Comrade Jie Jianbao did not stop there. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works, seriously examined his thoughts, and discovered that he did good deeds to receive praise, wanting to achieve both "self-interest" and "benefit to others." This idea does not align with Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely selfless and dedicated to others." Therefore, he resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions, launching an attack on the self-interest thoughts in his mind.

We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, just like Comrade Jie Jianbao, honestly and without any discount. Chairman Mao teaches us to be "completely selfless," so we must not have even a trace of self-interest; Chairman Mao teaches us to be "dedicated to others," so we must not have any motive or action that is not beneficial to others. We should have no private thoughts or ulterior motives.

Some comrades think that having a bit of private thoughts is a small matter, nothing to worry about. Even if these comrades do good deeds, they still drag along a tail of individualism. To be honest, their "benefit to others" ultimately is still for "self-interest." This is a serious mistake. Self-interest is a bourgeois worldview, benefiting others is a proletarian worldview, the two are incompatible. Without using the idea of benefiting others to overcome self-interest, without cutting off the tail of individualism, self-interest will emerge to hinder benefiting others. Today, if you retain a bit of self-interest, tomorrow it might develop into serious individualism. Here, we cannot have any "public-private partnership" or "merging the two." Comrade Jie Jianbao realized through practice: the more self-interest there is, the less benefit to others; only by being completely selfless can one be dedicated to others.

Self-interest thoughts have dominated people's minds for thousands of years, and it is not easy to eliminate them. If one does not, like Yu Gong moving mountains, make a firm decision, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties, it will be impossible to completely eradicate them. Comrade Jie Jianbao's experience tells us: to transform one's thoughts, one must use the yardstick of "completely" and "thoroughly." Only by completely and thoroughly casting aside the "I," can one completely and thoroughly serve the people.

    利己少一分　利人多一分
    立影
    群众缺柴烧，解建保同志牺牲休息时间帮助群众打柴。这是一件好事。但是，解建保同志并未以此为满足。他反复地学习毛主席著作，认真检查思想，发现自己做好事是为了受表扬，是想“利己”和“利人”两全其美。这个想法同毛主席教导的“毫不利己专门利人”对不上口。于是他坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，向头脑里的利己思想开火。
    我们要按照毛主席的指示办事，就要像解建保同志那样，老老实实，不打折扣。毛主席教导要“毫不利己”，我们就不能有一丝一毫的利己之心；毛主席教导要“专门利人”，我们就不能有一点不利人的动机和行动。我们应该做到没有一点私心杂念。
    有的同志以为，有点儿私心杂念是小事，没什么关系。这些同志即使是做好事，也要拖着一条个人主义的尾巴。说实在的，他们的利人，归根结底，还是为了利己。这是非常错误的。利己是资产阶级世界观，利人是无产阶级世界观，两者是水火不相容的。不用利人去克服利己，不割掉个人主义的尾巴，利己就会跑出来妨碍利人。今天保留了这点小的利己，明天就可能发展成为严重的个人主义。这里不能搞什么“公私合营”、“合二而一”。解建保同志在实践中体会到：利己多一分，利人就少一分；只有毫不利己，才能专门利人。
    利己思想统治人们的头脑已有几千年了，要消灭它是件不容易的事。如果不像愚公移山那样，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，就不可能彻底清除它。解建保同志的体会告诉我们：改造自己的思想，必须运用“完全”和“彻底”这个尺子，只有完全、彻底地丢开“我”字，才能完全、彻底地为人民服务。
