The joyous news of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao's seventh reception and inspection of the Cultural Revolution Army has spread across the country, and everywhere there is a festive atmosphere. Revolutionary masses in various places have held meetings and discussions, joyously celebrating the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the great situation of the Cultural Revolution and production construction. They expressed with the happiest and most heroic feelings that they will definitely not disappoint the trust and expectations of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and make the Cultural Revolution even better, achieving new and even greater victories.

Chairman Mao said to some responsible comrades on Tiananmen Rostrum, "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Cultural Revolution even better." This warm instruction from our great leader has given unlimited encouragement and strength to cadres nationwide. They said: Chairman Mao cares most about the masses and is heart to heart with them, always with the broad masses. This is forever our most brilliant example to learn from. At present, when the Cultural Revolution is developing more deeply, broadly, and healthily, we must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to go to the masses, be with the broad masses, resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely implement the Sixteen Articles, making the Cultural Revolution even better.

Workers and peasants in various places who are laboring in factories and fields heard the joyous news of Chairman Mao's seventh inspection of the Cultural Revolution Army and excitedly said: The current great situation of the Cultural Revolution and production construction in our country fully shows that Chairman Mao's correct line has deeply entered people's hearts, and following Chairman Mao forward is victory. They expressed their determination to implement Chairman Mao's instructions to seize the revolution and promote production. The entire crew of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive said: We will definitely take the Cultural Revolution as the main task, seize the revolution, and promote production, forever holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and on the revolutionary track indicated by Chairman Mao, full steam ahead, forging ahead bravely.

Farmers and herdsmen of various ethnic groups expressed that during the harvest season, when we are celebrating the red fruits of Mao Zedong Thought, the joyous news of Chairman Mao inspecting the Cultural Revolution Army has arrived, truly a double blessing. Members of the Dazhai-style advanced unit in Guangxi, Luocheng County, Xiongying Commune, Chelu Production Team said, we follow Chairman Mao's words, seize the revolution, and promote production, achieving a good harvest. Now, we must seriously study the "Three Old Articles," achieve ideological transformation, and do a good job in autumn harvest and winter sowing.

What is the reddest in the world? The sun on Tiananmen is the reddest. Who is the closest person in the world? The great leader Chairman Mao is the closest. Revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards in various places enthusiastically celebrated Chairman Mao's seventh reception of the Cultural Revolution Army, saying, Chairman Mao, even if we use all the water from the five lakes and four seas, we cannot express our love for you. Only a great leader like you can initiate and lead such a great revolutionary mass movement. You are with us every second, and you nurture us every moment. You are the reddest sun in our hearts, and we are the sunflowers that always face the red sun. We will forever be loyal to you, forever follow you in the great winds and waves of the revolution, advancing further. We will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform our subjective and objective worlds. With Mao Zedong Thought guiding us forward, we will have red hearts, bright eyes, brave spirits, and strong bones, daring to think, dare to venture, dare to rebel, and dare to revolutionize, never losing our direction. We will forever remember Chairman Mao's teachings, care about national affairs, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Many revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guard youngsters who are traveling on foot heard this joyous news, and their fatigue from many days was forgotten, and their confidence increased. They all expressed their determination to struggle lifelong on the revolutionary path opened by Chairman Mao, tempering themselves into good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The joyous news of our greatest leader Chairman Mao's seventh reception and inspection of the Cultural Revolution Army spread like a spring breeze throughout the People's Liberation Army units. The officers and soldiers of various units held celebration meetings, discussion meetings, and artistic performances, joyously celebrating the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, celebrating the brilliant achievements and great situation of the Cultural Revolution, and determined to follow Chairman Mao closely, resolutely implement and defend the proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and make the Cultural Revolution even better.

Chairman Mao said on Tiananmen Rostrum, "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Cultural Revolution even better." Chairman Mao's latest instructions greatly encouraged the cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army at all levels. Everyone unanimously agreed that this is the greatest concern, greatest care, and greatest encouragement from the great leader, illuminating the road to accelerate the realization of ideological transformation, and at the same time, it is the new mobilization order given by the great leader in the new stage of the socialist revolution, urging them to advance to a higher standard of revolutionization. The Kunming Military Region Party Committee immediately convened an emergency meeting of the Party Committee attended by responsible comrades from various major units to seriously study and discuss Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The Xinjiang Military Region Party Committee immediately convened an expanded meeting of the Standing Committee to study and discuss. These old cadres who have followed Chairman Mao in countless battles north and south said, Chairman Mao's teachings have grasped the essence. This is not only a guarantee for carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end but also the fundamental guarantee for our army to never change color.

Leaders of the Shenyang, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Wuhan, and many other units expressed: Our army is the people's army created by Chairman Mao. We will definitely, with the deepest class feelings for Chairman Mao, the most sincere attitude, the strongest party spirit, the most thorough revolutionary spirit, and the most resolute actions, execute Chairman Mao's great instructions, raise the self-awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works, insist on studying and applying them actively, take the "Three Old Articles" as a motto to study, and carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls. We will honestly go to the masses, humbly learn from the masses, be with the masses, make the Cultural Revolution even better, and in the mass movement, transform and temper ourselves, forever preserving our revolutionary youth.

At 10 o'clock on the morning of the 10th, when the majestic military music "The East is Red" played on Tiananmen Square, and Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao stepped onto Tiananmen Rostrum, the officers and soldiers who gathered around the loudspeakers and radios to listen to the joyous news from Beijing could not contain their excitement and joy, singing "The East is Red" and "The Great Ship Sails on the Ocean" with the Cultural Revolution Army on Tiananmen Square, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

When the loudspeaker broadcasted the great leader Chairman Mao's powerful voice shouting "Long live comrades!" the people immediately boiled over. Soldiers of a certain border defense unit stationed in the southwestern border, holding hands, sang a song they wrote themselves: "The rising sun, why is it so bright today? Because Chairman Mao has ascended Tiananmen; we border defense soldiers face Beijing and sing, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

Navy, Air Force, and soldiers of Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Jinan, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, as well as Railway Corps and Engineering Corps in many units said in discussions that Chairman Mao inspected and reviewed the Cultural Revolution Army for more than six hours continuously on the 10th on Tiananmen Rostrum, and on the 11th, he continued the inspection in an open-top car. This most powerfully shows that Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, wholeheartedly supports the revolutionary mass movement, and shares the same destiny and breathes the same air with the masses.

Many soldiers expressed in discussions: We must definitely follow Chairman Mao closely, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!
