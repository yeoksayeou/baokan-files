	The Head of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition Delegation Issues a Statement: The Friendship Between the Peoples of China and Japan Cannot Be Destroyed

	The Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition Delegation will definitely achieve final victory with the support of the Japanese people

	New China News Agency, November 25th: Nagoya News: On the evening of the 25th, Spokesperson of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition Delegation, Ren Jianxin, held a press conference and read out a statement from the Head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation, Xiao Xiangqian. The statement pointed out that the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan cannot be destroyed, and the exhibition will proceed as originally planned until the scheduled date.

	The statement pointed out that during the exhibition in Kitakyushu, the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition achieved unprecedented success due to the widespread support of the Japanese people. This exhibition in Nagoya has also received enthusiastic support from the people and friends in Nagoya and the Kansai region, and was successfully opened on the 19th. In recent days, the exhibition has received even broader support from the Japanese people.

	The statement said: "After the regrettable incidents on November 21st and 22nd, the number of Japanese friends visiting the exhibition did not decrease but instead increased. This once again vividly proves that no matter what kind of sabotage and disruption comes from any direction, it can only expose their hostile attitude towards the People's Republic of China and their ugly intentions to destroy the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and cannot harm the traditional fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan in the slightest."

	The statement concluded by saying that the Chinese Exhibition Delegation is determined to continue the exhibition according to the original plan until the scheduled date, and firmly believes that with the support of the Japanese people and friends, it will definitely achieve final victory.

    新华社二十五日讯  名古屋消息：中国经济贸易展览团发言人任健新二十五日晚举行记者招待会，宣读了中国展览团团长萧向前的声明。声明指出，中日两国人民的友谊是破坏不了的，展览会将按原计划进行到预定的日期。
    声明指出，中国经济贸易展览会在北九州展出期间，由于日本人民广泛的支持，获得了空前的成功。这次在名古屋展出也得到名古屋、关西地区的日本人民和各方面的朋友的热情支持，已于十九日胜利地开幕。连日来展览会得到了更广泛的日本人民的支持。
    声明说：“十一月二十一、二十二日连续发生了令人遗憾的事情之后，参观展览的日本朋友不但没有减少而且越来越多。这再一次雄辩地证明无论来自任何方面的破坏和捣乱，都只能暴露出他们敌视中华人民共和国和破坏中日两国人民友谊的丑恶面目，对中日两国人民之间的传统的战斗友谊，损坏不了一根毫毛。”
