The people of various circles in the capital solemnly celebrate the 22nd anniversary of Albania's liberation. Comrades Kang Sheng and Chen Yi attend. Chu Tu-nan and Dode enthusiastically praise the great friendship and fighting unity between China and Albania.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated November 28, more than a thousand people from various circles in the capital gathered this afternoon to solemnly celebrate the 22nd anniversary of Albania's liberation.

	Kang Sheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Chen Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the meeting. The meeting was held in the Hall of Nationalities. Portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, as well as the national flags of China and Albania, were hung on the rostrum.

	Before the meeting began, everyone read aloud the following text of the telegram sent by Chairman Mao to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party:

		"Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the glorious Albanian Labor Party is firmly holding high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism in the midst of the encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism.

		Heroic Albania, the people's Albania, has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe."

		"'In the world, there are friends, and across the seas, they are like neighbors.' Although the two countries are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected. We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We are not those false friends who are sweet-tongued but treacherous. We are not those two-faced people. Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests."

	The meeting began with Albanian Ambassador to China Vasili Nataneli and the head of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, P. Dode, escorted by Kang Sheng, Chen Yi, and others, walking onto the rostrum. At this moment, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly for a long time. More than a thousand people held up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Mao Tse-tung—Enver," "Enver—Mao Tse-tung," "Long live Mao Tse-tung," "Long live Enver."

Chu Tu-nan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and P. Dode, head of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, delivered enthusiastic speeches at the meeting.

	Chu Tu-nan, in his speech, warmly praised the heroic Albanian people for firmly holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Labor Party, bravely smashing the blockade and sabotage by imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership group, and the Tito clique, and achieving great successes in the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

	Chu Tu-nan praised the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people for consistently holding high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism and engaging in a head-on struggle with imperialism and revisionism. He said that the Albanian Labor Party has always been at the forefront of the struggle against revisionism, upholding principles and fighting unyieldingly, exposing and criticizing modern revisionism without mercy, defending and developing Marxism-Leninism, and making outstanding contributions to the great cause of the world proletarian revolution.

	Chu Tu-nan spoke about the recent Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party. He said that this was a revolutionary congress that firmly held high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. This congress will certainly push Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction to a new high tide and make greater contributions to the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

	Chu Tu-nan then spoke about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, is being carried out vigorously in our country, shaking the entire world. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has great historical and international significance, is a new stage of our socialist revolution that is deeper and broader, a great innovation of the communist movement, and a great innovation of the socialist revolution.

	Chu Tu-nan said, "The fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, forged by the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Tse-tung and the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, and tested in the revolutionary struggle for common ideals. We are true class brothers, and our friendship is a true proletarian class friendship. In the future, no matter what storms and tempests we encounter on our march forward, the peoples of the two countries will always stand together, fight together, and win together. Let us raise the banner of revolution against imperialism and modern revisionism even higher, and together with the revolutionary peoples of the world, strive together to overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, and overthrow the reactionaries of all countries!"

	Comrade P. Dode, head of the delegation, spoke about the great achievements of the Albanian people in overcoming the numerous difficulties created by imperialism and revisionism under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Labor Party, in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

	Comrade P. Dode said that the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party is a historic event for our party and people.

He said that Comrade Mao Tse-tung's telegram is a great encouragement and impetus to all party members and people of our country under the correct leadership of our party. Comrade Mao Tse-tung is the greatest and most respected friend of our people, so his words inspire our people to further consolidate the fruits of our socialist revolution.

	Comrade P. Dode said that the Albanian people congratulate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is currently being carried out extensively and deeply in China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of the thoughts of Chairman Mao.

	Comrade P. Dode pointed out that the role and contribution of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China in the struggle of the international proletariat and the revolutionary cause of the peoples of the world are extraordinarily great. It is an indestructible fortress of socialism, a strong base of revolution, a standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, a firm pillar and reliable guarantee of our common revolutionary cause.

He said that the great friendship and fighting unity between our people and party and the fraternal seven hundred million Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Tse-tung are indestructible, because they are firmly based on the lofty principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, born and tempered in the struggle against common enemies, and have shown their might in times of difficulty. Our two parties, two peoples, and two countries have always been shoulder to shoulder, advancing together in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique.

Dode's speech, on behalf of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, he presented a scroll with the words "The fighting brotherly friendship between Albania and China will last forever" to the meeting.
