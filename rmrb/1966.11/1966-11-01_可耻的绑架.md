A delegation led by Guinea's Foreign Minister Lansana arrived in Addis Ababa on October 29 to attend the Ministerial Council meeting of the Organization of African Unity. While passing through Ghana, the delegation was illegally abducted by the Ghanaian authorities. This is an unprecedented international crime of abduction orchestrated by U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Ghanaian authorities.

U.S. imperialism is the mastermind behind the coup in Ghana and the overthrow of the Nkrumah government. This most vicious enemy of the people of the world not only seeks to strangle the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Ghanaian people but also aims to strangle the entire national liberation movement in Africa. The government and people of the Republic of Guinea sympathize with and support the just cause of their Ghanaian brothers, opposing imperialism's savage counterattack on the African national liberation movement. U.S. imperialism hates this deeply. Taking advantage of the opportunity when the Guinean delegation was passing through Ghana on an American plane, U.S. imperialism colluded with the Ghanaian authorities to stage this abduction. As pointed out by the National Political Bureau of the Guinea Democratic Party and the Guinean government's communiqué: "The U.S. government must bear full responsibility for the illegal and premeditated actions of the Accra authorities."

This atrocity by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is not only a shameless provocation against the Guinean people but also a shameless provocation against all African people! Public opinion and the media in various African countries have strongly condemned this banditry by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The Guinea Democratic Party and government have lodged a protest with the U.S. government and sternly demanded that the U.S. government "fulfill its obligations" to safely escort the entire Guinean delegation to Addis Ababa. Otherwise, Guinea will "take all corresponding measures" against the U.S. government. This is the voice of justice in defending the dignity of the Guinean nation!

The Chinese people strongly condemn the despicable crime of abduction by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against the Guinean delegation and firmly support the just actions taken by the Guinea Democratic Party and government against U.S. imperialism.

    可耻的绑架
    本报评论员
    由几内亚外交部长朗萨纳率领的几内亚代表团，十月二十九日赴亚的斯亚贝巴出席非洲统一组织部长理事会会议，途经加纳，被加纳当局非法绑架。这是美帝国主义及其走卒加纳当局串通好的一件史无前例的国际绑架罪行。
    美帝国主义是加纳政变集团的后台老板，是颠覆恩克鲁玛政府的元凶。美帝国主义这个全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，不仅要扼杀加纳人民的反帝革命斗争，而且还企图扼杀整个非洲的民族解放运动。几内亚共和国政府和人民，同情和支持他们兄弟的加纳人民的正义事业，反对帝国主义对非洲民族解放运动的猖狂反扑。美帝国主义对此是恨之入骨的。美帝国主义趁几内亚代表团乘美国飞机路过加纳的机会，同加纳当局策划了这次绑架事件。正如几内亚民主党全国政治局和几内亚政府公报所指出的：“美国政府要对阿克拉当局所犯下的这种非法的和预谋的行动，承担全部责任。”
    美帝国主义及其走卒的这一暴行，是对几内亚人民的无耻挑衅，也是对全体非洲人民的无耻挑衅！非洲各国公众和舆论纷纷谴责美帝国主义及其走卒的这一强盗行为。
    几内亚民主党和政府已向美国政府提出抗议，并严正要求美国政府“履行自己的义务”，把几内亚代表团全体成员安全送往亚的斯亚贝巴，否则，几内亚将要“对美国政府采取一切相应的措施”。这是维护几内亚民族尊严的正义的声音！
    中国人民对美帝国主义及其走卒绑架几内亚代表团的卑鄙罪行，表示强烈愤慨，并坚决支持几内亚民主党和政府所采取的反对美帝国主义的正义行动。
