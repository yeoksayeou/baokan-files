Revolutionary soldiers must dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the revolution, putting everything in the service of the revolution. By prioritizing the interests of the revolution, one can achieve the goal of doing whatever the Party assigns.

I joined the army not long ago and was soon transferred to the company headquarters to serve as a medic. At the time, I thought: This job is both hygienic and easy, and I can also learn some skills, so I should do a good job!

Soon, I went to the regiment to participate in medic training, and I was very happy. However, after a month, because of my low education level, I couldn't understand what the instructors were teaching, and I felt that being a medic was a hard job, too taxing on the brain, and not as easy as being an infantryman. Just as my thoughts were wavering and I was pondering the question of "how to approach this," the medic team leader asked me to study Chairman Mao's works. I opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and repeatedly pondered Chairman Mao's words: "Many people are irresponsible in their work, shirking heavy tasks and pushing them onto others, taking on only the light ones. When faced with a task, they first think of themselves and then of others." I felt a burning sensation in my heart. I thought, am I not someone who first thinks of myself when faced with a task? At the crossroads of doing or not doing, I felt I should follow Chairman Mao's words and take on the heavy tasks. I constantly used Chairman Mao's teachings to struggle against my individualistic thoughts and finally won the first round, completing my studies with excellent results and returning to the company.

Less than two weeks after returning to the company, the old medic retired. At that time, several cases of dysentery occurred in the company. I had to check the patients' stools in the latrine more than ten times a day, and each time I felt nauseous. My thoughts began to waver again. I thought, there are so many tasks in the company, which one is dirtier than mine? Not only is it dirty, but if I'm not careful, I might get infected with a disease. Why do I have to do this dirty, smelly, and somewhat "dangerous" job? At this point, I regretted becoming a medic. My thoughts were "stuck," and my work couldn't be done well. Many patients gave me feedback, saying I didn't care about them. At this point, the question of "how to approach this" was once again before me. I opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again. Chairman Mao said: "An internationalist spirit, a communist spirit, every Chinese Communist Party member should learn this spirit." Reading this, I made up my mind to learn from Norman Bethune and to inject his spirit into my mind.

Later, I read an article by Shanghai Garrison Area Hospital nurse Shen Yuying, who studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" three times, which inspired me greatly. I used Shen Yuying as a mirror, comparing myself to her, and found that the difference between us was that I didn't treat the patients as my own family, so I felt they were dirty and smelly and didn't want to be near them. I thought, revolutionary soldiers are our class brothers, and for the people's revolutionary cause, they are willing to sacrifice their lives. Serving them is the most glorious thing in the world. This way, I no longer felt dirty or smelly. My thoughts and feelings changed, and my work enthusiasm was different. In the past, I was afraid to be near the patients, but now I actively seek them out, feeling that if I can help them reduce their pain, it is my happiness.

Through the process of how to approach the work of a medic, I deeply felt: All revolutionary work is ordinary, yet it is also extraordinary. No matter what work one does, one must start from the interests of the people and the revolution, and not from personal interests. Starting from personal interests, one always feels that one mountain is higher than another, and there will never be a suitable job. Starting from the interests of the revolution, one can achieve the goal of doing whatever the Party assigns, loving the work one does, and making extraordinary contributions in ordinary work.

    怎样对待所谓平凡的工作？
    革命战士要一心为革命，一切为革命。从革命的利益出发，就能做到党叫干啥就干啥。
                      卫生员　白玉才
    我入伍不久，就调到连部当卫生员。当时我想：这工作既卫生又轻松，还可以学点技术，可要好好干啊！
    不久，我到团部参加卫生员集训，心里很高兴。可是过了一个月，因为自己文化低，教员讲的接受不了，就又觉得卫生员这碗饭好吃难消化，太费脑子，还不如当步兵省事。正在我思想动摇，发生
  “怎样对待”这个问题的时候，卫生队长要我学习毛主席著作。我翻开《纪念白求恩》，反复琢磨毛主席的这几句话：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”心里觉得火辣辣的，我想，自己不就是一事当前，先替自己打算的人吗？在干或不干的“十字路口”，我觉得我应该听毛主席的话去挑重担子。我不断用毛主席的教导同我的个人主义思想作斗争，终于获得了第一个回合的胜利，以优秀的成绩结束学习，回到了连队。
    回到连里不到两个星期，老卫生员就退役了。那时候连队发生了几个痢疾病号，我一天要十几次地到厕所检查病人的大便，每次检查，就感到恶心。这时我的思想又动摇起来了。我想，连队里这么多工作，哪一桩能比得上自己的工作脏呢？不单是脏，弄不好还会感染疾病，干哪样不好，为什么偏要干这个又脏又臭还有点“危险”的工作呢？这时我后悔不该当卫生员了。思想“抛了锚”，工作就不可能干好，不少病号给我提意见，说我对病号不关心。这时，“怎样对待”的问题又摆在我面前了。我再一次翻开《纪念白求恩》，毛主席说：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。”读到这里，我就下定决心要向白求恩学习，一心要把白求恩精神“注射”到我的头脑里。
    后来，我又读了上海警备区某部医院护士沈玉英三学《纪念白求恩》的文章，对我很有启发。我把沈玉英当镜子，对照自己，发觉我和沈玉英的差距，就在于没有把病人当作自己的亲人，因此才觉得他们又脏又臭，不乐意接近他们。我想，革命战士是我们的阶级兄弟，阶级兄弟生了病，嫌他们脏和臭，这是什么样的阶级感情？这样反过来调过去一想，觉得自己原来的想法错了。此后，遇到脏和臭的事，我就想，我们的阶级兄弟为了人民的革命事业，乐于献出自己的生命，侍候他们是世界上最光荣不过的事。这样，脏也就不觉得脏了，臭也就不觉得臭了。思想感情变了，工作的劲头也就不同了。过去我是怕和病人接近，现在是主动去找病人，觉得如果能够帮助他们减少一分痛苦，就是我的一分幸福。
    通过怎样对待卫生员工作的前后过程，我深深体会到：所有的革命工作，都是平凡的，又都是不平凡的。一个人不论干什么工作，都要从人民的利益、革命的利益出发，而不能从个人利益出发。从个人利益出发，老觉得那山又比这山高，总不会有合适的工作。从革命利益出发，就能做到党叫干啥就干啥，干一行爱一行，在平凡的工作当中作出不平凡的贡献。
