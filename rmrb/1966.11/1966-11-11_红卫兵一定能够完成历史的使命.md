I am a Burmese youth, but my heart yearns for China. Every day we listen to the heroic deeds of the Chinese Red Guards, daring to rebel and daring to revolt, and we feel extremely excited and admiring. Red Guards, you are doing well, you are doing the right thing. You are truly the good students and good youths taught by Chairman Mao. You are the reddest, most revolutionary, and most proletarianized intellectuals in history. You are the world's first batch of red revolutionary successors. With you Red Guard youngsters, the proletarian dictatorship of the Chinese people will forever be an ironclad fortress.

You are not only the Red Guards of the Chinese people, but also the most reliable and advanced revolutionary vanguard of the world's proletariat. We firmly believe that the Red Guards armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will surely overcome all difficulties and obstacles, surely fulfill the mission entrusted by history, and surely not disappoint the expectations of the world's people.

We must bury all imperialists and modern revisionists!

    红卫兵一定能够完成历史的使命
    我是一个缅甸青年，我的心却向往中国。我们每天收听中国红卫兵们敢闯、敢造反的英雄事迹，心里感到非常之激动与佩服。红卫兵们，你们干得好，干得对，你们不愧是毛主席教导出来的好学生、好青年。你们是有史以来最红、最革命、最无产阶级化的知识分子，你们是世界上第一批红色的革命接班人。有了你们红卫兵小将，中国人民的无产阶级政权将永远成为铁打江山。
    你们不仅是中国人民的红卫兵，同时也是全世界无产者的最可靠、最先进的革命先锋队。我们坚信用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵，一定能够战胜一切困难和障碍，一定能够完成历史赋予你们的使命，一定不辜负世界人民对你们的期望。
    我们一定要把帝国主义者和现代修正主义者全部埋葬！
  　〔缅甸〕一青年
