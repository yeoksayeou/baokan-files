Edition: 3

Time: October 30, 1966, after dinner
Place: Clubhouse
Participants: All comrades of the 9th Platoon, "Tiantai Mountain Assault Company," of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army

Content: Study a passage from "In Memory of Norman Bethune" about criticism and self-criticism

Platoon Leader Xu Yongjie announced the start of the lecture meeting.

Mao Zedong Thought Study Instructor Lan Bingxiang led everyone in reciting Chairman Mao's words:

"Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings. As long as we persist in what is right for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our ranks will definitely grow stronger."

Platoon Leader Xu Yongjie then said, "Comrades, based on Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently, we have focused on this passage from Chairman Mao in the previous stage to address the main problems in our platoon. We have repeatedly studied, applied, understood, and implemented it, achieving some results. Today, we will hold a lecture meeting on the theme of 'Listen to Chairman Mao's Words, Actively Carry Out Criticism and Self-Criticism' to share our study experiences and insights. What do you all think?"

"Good!" All comrades in the platoon responded in unison.

Soldier Lin Shuiming:

Chairman Mao teaches us that since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings. I feel that:

Fear or lack of fear of criticism reflects two different worldviews.

Previously, I had a bad habit: I felt happy when I heard praise but turned red when I received criticism. For example, last Saturday, I went on a mission to repair a pigpen and got my clothes dirty. When I returned, everyone was cleaning their weapons. To quickly go wash my clothes, I hurriedly finished cleaning my gun. Comrade Lan Bingxiang saw this and criticized me. At that time, I was not happy and thought: Everyone has been busy all day, covered in mud, and you didn't notice, but you nitpick over such small things. Later, under the guidance of the platoon leader, through studying Chairman Mao's works, I realized that being careless with gun cleaning is an irresponsible act towards the people. I felt very regretful and asked myself: Why am I always afraid of others' criticism?

After studying this passage from Chairman Mao, I found the root cause. I did not first examine whether I served the people well but felt that others did not understand the situation and that "I" was wronged. The fundamental reason I was afraid of criticism was that deep in my soul, the "I" was at play.

Fear or lack of fear of criticism reflects two different worldviews. A person must establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people to not be afraid of others' criticism. From then on, I strictly demanded of myself with the two measures of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, gradually overcoming this bad habit.

Soldier Lan Bingxiang:

Chairman Mao wants us to persist in what is right for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests. Therefore:

Daring or not daring to criticize also reflects two different worldviews.

That day, Lin Shuiming returned from repairing the pigpen, and I saw him cleaning his gun carelessly, knowing he wanted to hurry to wash his clothes. I felt he was wrong and pointed out that this was an irresponsible act towards the people. However, seeing that he was not happy to accept the criticism, I swallowed my words halfway. Later, the platoon leader criticized Lin Shuiming, and my face felt hot, making me uncomfortable and regretful for not fulfilling my duty to my comrade.

That evening, during "Daily Reflection," reflecting on Chairman Mao's teaching of "persisting in what is right for the people's interests and correcting what is wrong for the people's interests," I realized that I did not dare to insist on the correct opinion to the end because I had selfish motives and was afraid of offending people. Through this incident, I deeply felt that only by being selfless can one be fearless, and only by thinking of the people's interests can one have the courage to fight against all bad tendencies to the end. Daring or not daring to criticize others' shortcomings also reflects two different worldviews.

Deputy Platoon Leader Wang Xuezhang:

Criticism should not have selfish motives; it must have the correct guiding ideology. That is:

Criticism must start from the people's interests.

Once, during "Daily Training," the platoon leader went to a meeting. The battalion commander saw us practicing bayonet combat, and everyone was very serious, except for Comrade Liang Xizhen, who was not focused, holding the gun with one hand and looking around, sometimes even missing the commands. At that time, I was very angry and blamed him for not representing our "Four Good" platoon in front of the battalion commander. I criticized him harshly, saying he was lazy and had no sense of danger. Who would have thought that this made his mood even worse, and his actions became even more careless. Why was the effect of the criticism so bad?

After studying Chairman Mao's teaching of "we persist in what is right for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests," I realized that Liang's shortcomings had been discovered by me long ago, but I always thought he was a new comrade and indulged him. This time, for the sake of the battalion commander's face and to add some glory to myself, I immediately put several hats on him, which he naturally could not accept. The root cause of the problem was that my guiding ideology for criticism was not correct; it was not for the people's interests and the comrade's progress but was mixed with selfish motives. Usually, I did not insist on the people's interests and help comrades progress, but when problems arose, I considered my own "face" and put hats on comrades. This is wrong. Therefore, I actively checked my shortcomings with Comrade Liang, and he was very moved, also actively checking with me.

Through this incident, I deeply felt that when criticizing others, one must first correct one's motives and attitudes, truly starting from the people's interests to achieve good results.

Veteran Soldier Zhou Xicheng:

In our minds, there will always be a struggle between "public" and "private." Only by constantly engaging in self-criticism can we overcome various selfish motives and establish the thought of serving the people. Therefore:

The more self-aware the self-criticism, the more self-aware the service to the people.

Half a month ago, I received a letter saying my mother was seriously ill and wanted me to return home to visit. However, at that time, the company's work was busy, and I could not return immediately, making me a bit upset. The platoon leader found out and talked to me, caring about what was on my mind. I was afraid to reveal my thoughts, fearing it would look bad, so I did not speak my mind. Later, with the help of the leadership and comrades, although I recognized my shortcomings, I had already caused some damage to the party's work, making me very sad and resentful for not correcting my shortcomings quickly.

After studying Chairman Mao's teaching of "since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings," I suddenly understood. I realized that the struggle between "public" and "private" thoughts will constantly appear in our minds, reflecting class struggle. Fearing ugliness and not daring to reveal it is not the way. Only by actively exposing it, through self-criticism, and thoroughly defeating it, can we establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. The more self-aware the self-criticism, the more self-aware the service to the people. From then on, whenever I had problems I could not understand, I actively brought the problems to study Chairman Mao's works and consciously engaged in self-criticism. This indeed solved problems more timely.

Recently, during the construction of water conservancy projects in the commune, the leadership appointed me as the surveyor. During the labor, I saw comrades carrying stones and swinging large hammers, working until they were covered in sweat, while I held a measuring rod, running here and there, feeling a bit uneasy, as if I was shorter than others. But I immediately realized that the "I" was at play again. Therefore, I actively reported my thoughts to the platoon leader. With the platoon leader's help, through studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I consciously criticized my selfish motives. This way, my initiative and enthusiasm for work greatly increased, and I successfully completed the surveying task.

Platoon Leader Xu Yongjie:

The appearance of a platoon depends on many factors. Through the previous stage of work, I deeply felt that:

Criticism and self-criticism will make our ranks stronger.

Previously, I had a confused idea that the appearance of a platoon's good or bad depended only on whether it was united. Under this understanding, I one-sidedly emphasized that everyone should pay attention to unity, neglecting necessary criticism and self-criticism. As a result, everyone lacked regular ideological exchanges and timely ideological struggles, which instead affected unity. For a period, several incidents of disunity occurred in the platoon, making me very troubled. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works, I finally understood.

Chairman Mao said: "As long as we persist in what is right for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our ranks will definitely grow stronger." This tells us that to do a good job, to lead a unit or department well, we must advocate for serious criticism and self-criticism. I deeply realized that previously, I one-sidedly emphasized unity, neglecting necessary ideological struggles, which was wrong. To carry out ideological struggles, we must achieve the goal of unity. From then on, I changed my previous approach, advocating for serious criticism and self-criticism in the platoon, and after everyone's research, chose this passage from Chairman Mao as the main content for everyone to study and apply during this period. This way, the appearance of the platoon indeed changed greatly. Through ideological struggles, everyone became more united, and now there is true unity. From this, I deeply felt that the appearance of a platoon, although depending on many factors, is a very important factor in whether there is serious criticism and self-criticism.

Now, the good atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism in our platoon has basically formed, and everyone's speeches fully demonstrate this. However, we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and never have any arrogance. In the future, we must all use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, more seriously and actively carry out criticism and self-criticism. Through criticism and self-criticism, constantly transform our worldview. Some comrades said well: Criticism and self-criticism are not just a matter of method; they themselves are a reflection of two different worldviews. Fear or lack of fear of criticism, daring or not daring to criticize and engage in self-criticism, all have the struggle between "public" and "private." We must all consciously master this Marxist-Leninist weapon, eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, strive for ideological revolutionization, build our platoon into a solid "Four Good" platoon, defend the motherland, and contribute to the world revolution!

### 听毛主席的话，积极开展批评与自我批评

专栏：活学活用“老三篇”讲用会

    时　间：一九六六年十月三十日晚饭后
    地　点：俱乐部
    参加者：解放军某部“天台山突击连”九班
              全体同志
    内　容：学习《为人民服务》中一段关于批
            评与自我批评的语录
    班长徐永捷宣布讲用会开始。
    毛主席著作学习辅导员兰炳祥带领大家背诵毛主席语录：
      “因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。……只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”
    接着班长徐永捷说：“同志们，我们根据林副主席活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫的指示，在前一阶段针对咱们班存在的主要问题，选用毛主席这条语录，反复学，反复用，反复领会，反复落实，收到了一定效果。今天，我们就以‘听毛主席的话，积极开展批评与自我批评’为主题，开一个讲用会，谈谈自己的学习心得和体会，大家说好不好？”
      “好！”全班同志齐声回答。战士　林水明：
    毛主席教导我们，因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。　我觉得：
  怕不怕批评，是两种世界观的反映
    以前，我有一个毛病，听了恭维话，心里乐滋滋的，受了批评就面红耳赤。譬如上星期六，我出公差去修猪栏，衣服弄得很脏，回来时，大家正在擦拭武器。为了早点去洗衣服，我三两下就把枪擦完了。兰炳祥同志看到这种情景，向我提出批评。当时我听了，很不服气，心想：人家忙了半天，弄得一身泥，你们看不见，一星半点的小事却抓得那么认真。后来在班长启发下，通过学习毛主席著作，我才认识到擦枪马虎是对人民不负责任的表现。我很后悔，暗暗责问自己：为什么总是害怕别人的批评呢？
    学习了毛主席这段语录，我才找到了病根子。我不是先检查自己为人民服务得好不好，而是先觉得别人不了解情况，“我”受了委屈。自己所以怕批评，根本原因在于自己灵魂深处有“我”字在作怪。
      “怕”与“不怕”批评，是两种世界观的反映。一个人必须树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，才不怕别人批评。从此，我处处用“完全”“彻底”为人民服务这两把尺子严格要求自己，这个毛病也就逐渐克服了。战士　兰炳祥：
    毛主席要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的。所以：
    敢不敢批评，也是两种世界观的反映
    那天，林水明修猪栏回来，我见他擦枪很马虎，知道他是想赶着去洗衣服。我觉得他这样做不对头，向他指出这是对人民不负责任的表现。可是，看见他不大乐意接受批评，我话说了半截就咽下去了。后来，班长批评林水明，我脸上也火辣辣的，心里很不自在，懊悔自己对同志没尽到责任。
    当晚“天天照”时，对照毛主席“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”的教导检查自己，我才认识到，自己所以不敢把正确的意见坚持到底，是因为自己有私心，怕得罪人。通过这件事，我深深体会到：无私才能无畏，一心想着人民的利益，才会有同一切不良倾向坚决斗争、一斗到底的勇气。敢不敢批评别人的缺点，这也是两种世界观的反映。副班长　王学章：
    批评不能有私心杂念，要有正确的指导思想。　这就是：
    批评必须从人民的利益出发
    有一次“天天练”，班长开会去了。营长同志看我们练刺杀，大家都很认真，只有梁锡贞同志精力不够集中，手端着枪，两眼却一个劲地东瞅西望，有时连口令也听错了。当时，我真窝火，暗暗埋怨他在营首长面前也不为我们这个“四好班”争口气。下来就狠狠地批评了他一顿，说他稀稀拉拉，没有一点敌情观念。谁知这样一来，他的情绪更低落了，动作越发不认真了。为什么批评的效果这样糟呢？
    学习了毛主席“我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”的教导，我才认识到：小梁的缺点，我早已经发现了，但总认为他是新同志，迁就了他。这次训练，为了在营首长面前给班里争口气，自己脸上添点儿光彩，我一下子就扣给他几顶大帽子，他当然接受不了。发生问题的原因还在于自己批评的指导思想不正确，不是为了人民的利益和同志的进步，而是掺杂着私心杂念。平时不坚持人民的利益，帮助同志进步，发生了问题，却考虑自己的“面子”，给同志扣帽子。这是错误的。于是，我主动向小梁检查了自己的缺点，他很受感动，也主动对我作了检讨。
    通过这件事，我深深体会到：批评别人时，首先要端正自己的动机和态度，要真正从人民的利益出发，才能收到好的效果。老战士　邹昔成：
    在我们脑子里随时都会有“公”与“私”的斗争，只有经常地进行自我批评，才能不断地克服各种私心杂念，树立起为人民服务的思想。　因此：
    自我批评越自觉，为人民服务就越自觉
    半个月前，我收到一封家信说母亲病重，要我赶紧回家探望。但是，当时连队工作正紧，不能马上回去，我有些想不开。班长发现后，找我谈心，关切地问我有什么思想疙瘩。我怕把思想亮出来，脸上不好看，就没有说出心里话。后来，在领导和同志们的帮助下，我虽然认识了自己的缺点，但已经使党的工作受到一定损失，我很难过，暗暗痛恨自己改正缺点太慢。
    经过学习毛主席“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出”的教导，才豁然开朗了。我认识到：“公”与“私”两种思想的斗争是会经常在我们脑子里出现的，这是阶级斗争的反映。对待自己的私心杂念，怕丑不敢亮是不行的，越怕就会越丑。只有主动揭露它，通过自我批评，彻底斗倒它，才能树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想。自我批评越是自觉，为人民服务就越自觉。从此以后，每当有什么问题想不通时，我就主动带着问题学习毛主席著作，自觉地进行自我批评。这样做，果然问题解决得及时多了。
    最近到公社修水利时，领导叫我当测量员，在劳动中，我看到同志们搬石头、抡大锤，干得汗流浃背，自己却拿着根标杆，这里跑跑，那里晃晃，就有些不安，觉得自己好像比别人矮了半截。但我马上意识到，这又是“我”字在作怪了。于是，就主动找班长汇报了自己的思想。在班长的帮助下，通过学习《为人民服务》，自觉批判了自己的私心杂念，这样，工作的自觉性和积极性大大提高了，最后圆满地完成了测量任务。班长　徐永捷：
    一个班的面貌如何，取决于许多因素，通过前阶段的工作，我还
    深深体会到：批评与自我批评
    会使我们的队伍兴旺过去，我有一个糊涂观念，认为一个班的面貌好坏，只要看它团结得好不好。在这种认识的指导下，我片面地强调大家要注意团结，忽视了必要的批评与自我批评。结果，大家因为缺乏经常的思想见面和及时的思想交锋，反倒影响了团结。有一段时间，班里连续发生了几次不团结的现象，我感到很苦恼。后来，学习了毛主席著作，我心里才亮堂了。
    毛主席说：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”这就是告诉我们，要想把工作搞好，要想把一个单位或部门领导好，就必须提倡认真的批评与自我批评。我深刻认识到，过去自己片面地强调团结，忽视必要的思想斗争是错误的，要开展思想斗争，才能达到团结的目的。从此，我改变了原来的做法，在班里提倡了认真的批评与自我批评，并且经过大家研究，选择了毛主席这一条语录作为这个时期大家学用的主要内容。这样一来，班里的面貌果然发生了很大的变化，通过思想斗争，大家更齐心了，现在才真正有了团结。从这里，我深深体会到：一个班的面貌如何，虽然取决于多方面的因素，但是，有无认真的批评与自我批评，是一个很重要的因素。
    现在，批评和自我批评的良好风气在咱们班已经基本形成，大家的发言，充分地说明了这一点。但是我们要牢记毛主席的教导，决不能有丝毫骄傲情绪。今后，咱们大家一定要以毛泽东思想为武器，更加认真、更加积极地开展批评与自我批评。通过批评与自我批评，不断地改造世界观。有些同志说得好，批评与自我批评不单是方法的问题，它本身就是两种世界观的反映。怕不怕批评，敢不敢批评与自我批评，都有“公”和“私”的斗争。我们大家要自觉地掌握这个马克思列宁主义的武器，灭资兴无，破私立公，努力实现思想革命化，把咱们班建设成一个梆梆硬的四好班，保卫祖国，为世界革命作出贡献！
