Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary initiative of the masses the most. He is forever united with the hearts of the masses. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will turn your trust and care for us into boundless strength and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, is applauding for us. We will forever keep in our hearts the care and hope that Chairman Mao has for us! We will forever march forward on the path that you have shown us, daring to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, with every red heart turned towards the Party!
