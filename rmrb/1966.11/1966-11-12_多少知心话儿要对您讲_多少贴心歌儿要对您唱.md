Many heartfelt words to tell you,
Many heartfelt songs to sing for you.

Revolutionary teachers and students, as well as Red Guards from all over the country who have come to Beijing, have written to this newspaper, enthusiastically describing their boundless love and respect for our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. Below are excerpts from some of these letters. — Editor

Chairman Mao, we compare you to the red sun. But how can the sun be as bright as you? The sun in nature illuminates the east but cannot illuminate the west at the same time. Your thoughts illuminate the hearts of revolutionary people all over the world. — A Red Guard from the East China Institute of Technology

The moon follows the Earth, the Earth follows the sun. We will forever follow the Party and our beloved leader, Chairman Mao. We will never turn back, even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble. — A Mongolian student from Inner Mongolia University

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! With you as our helmsman, we fear neither stormy seas nor mountains of knives and seas of fire. We dare to tread paths where no one has gone before and scale peaks that no one has climbed. We will surely follow you from victory to victory! — Revolutionary teachers and students from Longnan Junior Middle School, Jiangxi

No matter how unpredictable the winds and clouds in the world may be, no matter how many cold currents the Arctic Ocean brings, no matter how high the waves in the Taiwan Strait surge, we will surely follow you, leveling mountains and parting seas, and eliminating all demons and monsters in the world. — A student from Guangxi Normal University

The first slogan we, the people of Ruijin, shouted was “Long live Chairman Mao!” The first song we sang was “The sun rises red, and Mao Zedong appears in China.” The stories we love to hear the most are about Chairman Mao leading the people of the old revolutionary base in Jiangxi to make revolution. Chairman Mao was, is, and will forever be our revolutionary guide. — Some revolutionary teachers and students from Ruijin, Jiangxi

Beloved Chairman Mao, as we come to your side, we seem to see the red flag on Jinggang Mountain, the torches on the Long March, and the lights in Zhaoyuan. Chairman Mao, it is you who led our fathers to fight south and north, winning the country. We will surely follow you, forever defending the revolutionary mountains and rivers, and keeping them unchanged for generations to come! — A Red Guard from Nanchang's August 1st School

Most beloved Chairman Mao, there are so many heartfelt words to tell you, so many heartfelt songs to sing for you. Thousands of songs and millions of words cannot express our love for you. In one sentence: We will surely forever read your books, listen to your words, and follow you forward in the great winds and waves, becoming revolutionary pioneers who are never satisfied. — A Red Guard from Liaoning University

Beloved Chairman Mao, we have traveled thousands of miles from Hainan Island to bring you eight large characters made from rubber tree seeds: “Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life.” This is the most sincere wish of all the people of Hainan Island and our report to you. We are following your teachings, becoming a red seed, taking root, blooming, and bearing fruit in Hainan Island. — Some revolutionary teachers and students from the South China Institute of Tropical Crops

A lamp cannot light up without electricity, and our light for serving the people is Mao Zedong Thought. Once revolutionary people grasp the four volumes of great works, they are like the Yangtze River, surging and roaring, releasing boundless energy. Chairman Mao, I will surely read your books for a lifetime, drawing courage and wisdom from your treasure trove, and tirelessly struggling for the cause of communism, shining wherever there is a spark of heat. — A Red Guard from Jinan, Shandong
