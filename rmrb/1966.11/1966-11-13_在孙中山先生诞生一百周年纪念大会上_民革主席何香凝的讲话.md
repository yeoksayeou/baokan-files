Today marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the initiator and leader of the Xinhai Revolution. He led the movement to overthrow the Qing government, opposed the theory of constitutional monarchy, and advocated the establishment of a democratic republic in China. In his later years, he took a further step forward. He developed the old Three Principles of the People, which emphasized national independence, democracy, and the equalization of land rights, into a new Three Principles of the People that advocated unity with the Soviet Union under Lenin, unity with the Communist Party of China, and unity with the workers and peasants. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, through long-term revolutionary practice, increasingly advocated relying on armed struggle and combining the mass movement of workers and peasants as a means to achieve the Chinese democratic revolution. The goal of the revolution was directly aimed at imperialism and domestic feudal warlords.

Dr. Sun was the first person in China's modern history to propose "revolution." He began using the term "revolution" more than seventy years ago.

Dr. Sun was born into a peasant family in Cuiheng Village, Zhongshan County, Guangdong. While studying medicine in Hong Kong, Macau, and later in Hawaii, Southeast Asia, and Europe, he propagated anti-imperialist and anti-Qing dynasty thoughts among his fellow students and friends, organized revolutionary groups, and prepared for revolution. In 1903, in Japan, he often held meetings with Zhu Zhixin, Li Zhongshi, Li Zhangda, and Ma Junwu at our home. In 1905, the Chinese Alliance, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, was established in Tokyo, Japan. Many Chinese students studying in Japan joined this revolutionary organization and actively carried out anti-Qing revolutionary activities. Dr. Sun firmly opposed the reformist faction advocating constitutional monarchy. He advocated overthrowing the emperor through revolutionary military means and establishing a democratic republic. Under Dr. Sun's leadership, the Chinese people, through the Xinhai Revolution, finally ended China's more than two-thousand-year-old feudal imperial system. This is one of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great historical achievements.

After the establishment of the republic, Dr. Sun led the struggle against Yuan Shikai, and against the feudal warlords Wu Peifu, Duan Qirui, and others. In this series of struggles, especially after the victory of the Russian October Revolution led by Lenin and the emergence of the Chinese proletariat on the historical stage, he gradually clarified the need to adapt to the new situation of the Chinese revolution and develop the old Three Principles of the People into the new Three Principles of the People. With the help of the Communist Party of China, he reorganized the Kuomintang and proposed the famous "unity with the Soviet Union, opposition to imperialism, unity with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants" three major policies. This laid the political foundation for the First United Front between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which is another great historical achievement of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen dared to propose the slogan "Down with imperialism," dared to unite with the first proletarian state in the world, and dared to cooperate with the vanguard of the Chinese proletariat. This is precisely the manifestation of his great revolutionary spirit of adapting to the world's trend and meeting the needs of the people, progressing with the times. He also implemented the policy of assisting workers and peasants and proposed the idea of "land to the tiller," which had progressive significance at that time. Although Dr. Sun was not a scientific socialist or a Marxist, he dared to revolutionize and oppose imperialism, which is something that old revisionists and Soviet modern revisionists cannot compare with.

The greatest characteristic of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life is his continuous progress and insistence on revolution, becoming more resolute in his later years. Dr. Sun's later years are admired by all.

After Dr. Sun's death, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique completely betrayed Dr. Sun's will. They not only did not implement Dr. Sun's three major policies of unity with the Soviet Union, opposition to imperialism, unity with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants, but also betrayed the revolutionary new Three Principles of the People. They even brutally suppressed the revolutionary movement, massacring hundreds of thousands of revolutionary fighters, and delaying the victory of the Chinese revolution by more than twenty years.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people not only thoroughly completed the democratic revolution that Dr. Sun had not completed but also immediately carried out the socialist revolution. Through land reform, agricultural cooperatives, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and the Great Leap Forward, a series of miracles appeared in China. Under the guidance of the general line for socialist construction, the Chinese people have developed agriculture, built industry, and achieved great successes. Just a few days ago, we successfully conducted the test of missile and nuclear weapons, which made the people of the world who oppose imperialism praise in unison and made the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists who rely on nuclear blackmail tremble with fear. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have achieved in just seventeen years what capitalist countries in Asia took a hundred years and in Europe took two hundred years to achieve. The ideal of building China by Dr. Sun Yat-sen has been far surpassed by the great people of China under the leadership of Chairman Mao. I am ninety years old, and I am fortunate to have witnessed and personally participated in the two great revolutions led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen: the overthrow of the Qing government and the Northern Expedition by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. I am also fortunate to have witnessed and personally participated in the completion of the Chinese democratic revolution and the thorough implementation of the socialist revolution led by Chairman Mao, laying the foundation for communism in the future. I am so happy!

What particularly inspires me on the occasion of commemorating the 100th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth is that Chairman Mao, not content with the increasing strength of our motherland, and in order to ensure that our motherland will never change color and to set an example for revolutionary people all over the world, personally led the unprecedented Cultural Revolution. How fast the wheels of history are turning in China! Just as people are marveling at how quickly the Chinese people have mastered the technology of manufacturing atomic bombs, China has produced an even greater event—the Cultural Revolution! The Chinese people, with a brand-new spiritual appearance, have appeared on the world stage, shocking the world. Revolutionary people are cheering. Counter-revolutionary reactionaries are losing their souls. Everyone is increasingly seeing how the birth and growth of New China are profoundly influencing the course of world history. Looking back a hundred years to China, looking back fifty-five years to the time of the Xinhai Revolution, looking back forty-one years to the time of Dr. Sun's death, today's China is so different!

I am old. What slightly consoles me is that in the stage of democratic revolution, I followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and in the stage of socialist revolution, I followed Chairman Mao. Now, I learn from Dr. Sun Yat-sen and strive to maintain the integrity of a revolutionary. Now, the Cultural Revolution has come. This is a great revolution that decides the fate of China and influences the future of the world. Although I am ninety years old, I still have the determination to keep up with the requirements of the times in the Cultural Revolution and continue to maintain my revolutionary integrity in this great revolution. I call on all comrades who have followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen not to be discouraged, not to rely on seniority, not to sit on the baggage of old experience and make no progress. We must be determined to follow Chairman Mao to the end, continue to reform ourselves, and continue to strive forward. I believe that only in this way can we best commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen and countless revolutionary martyrs and predecessors.

    在孙中山先生诞生一百周年纪念大会上
    民革主席何香凝的讲话
    今天是孙中山先生诞生一百周年纪念日。孙中山先生是辛亥革命的创始人和领导人。他带头提倡推翻清朝政府的运动，反对君主立宪论，提出要在中国建立民主主义的共和国的主张。在他的晚年，他更前进了一步，他把民族独立、民主主义、平均地权的旧三民主义，进一步发展为联合列宁时代的苏联，联合中国共产党，联合工人农民的新三民主义。孙中山先生从长期的革命实践中越来越明确地主张，依靠武装斗争，结合工人农民的群众运动，作为达成中国民主革命的手段，革命的目标直接指向帝国主义和国内的封建军阀。
    孙先生是中国近百年史中，第一个提出“革命”的人。他开始使用“革命”这两个字，是在七十多年前了。
    孙先生生自广东中山县翠亨村一个农民的家庭。他在香港澳门学医的时候，以及到檀香山、南洋、欧洲各地时，就已在同学及友人中宣传反对帝国主义，反对清皇朝的思想，筹组革命团体，准备进行革命。一九○三年他在日本，朱执信、黎仲实、李章达、马君武等人常常在我们家中开会。一九○五年由孙中山先生领导的中国同盟会在日本东京成立，我们很多留学日本的中国青年学生都参加了这个革命组织，积极进行反清革命活动。孙先生坚决反对主张君主立宪的改良派，他主张用革命军事手段推翻皇帝，建立民主共和国。在孙先生领导之下，中国人民经过辛亥革命，终于结束了中国两千多年的封建帝制。这是孙中山先生的一个伟大的历史功绩。
    共和国成立以后，孙先生又领导了反对袁世凯，反对陆荣廷、陈炯明、沈鸿英、杨希闵以及反对吴佩孚、段祺瑞等封建军阀的斗争。在这一系列的斗争中，特别是在列宁领导下的俄国无产阶级十月革命胜利和中国无产阶级登上历史舞台之后，他逐步明确了要适应中国革命的新形势，把旧三民主义发展为新三民主义。他在中国共产党帮助下，改组了国民党，提出了著名的“联俄反帝、联共、扶助农工”三大政策。这就奠定了第一次国共合作的政治基础，这是孙中山先生又一个伟大的历史功绩。
    孙中山先生当时敢于提出“打倒帝国主义”的口号，敢于联合世界上第一个无产阶级专政的国家，敢于同中国无产阶级的先锋队实行合作，这正是他能够“适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要”，随着时代的进步而进步的伟大革命精神的表现。他还实行扶助农工的政策和提出“耕者有其田”的主张，这在当时，也是有进步意义的。孙先生虽然不是科学社会主义者，不是马克思主义者，但是他敢于革命，敢于反对帝国主义，这是老修正主义者和苏联现代修正主义者根本不能比拟的。
    孙中山先生一生最大的特点是他的不断进步，坚持革命，越到晚年越坚决。孙先生的晚节是万人共仰的。
    孙先生去世之后，蒋介石反动派完全背叛了孙中山先生遗志。他们不仅不执行孙先生联俄反帝、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，出卖了革命的新三民主义，而且甚至血腥镇压革命运动，屠杀了几百万革命战士，使中国革命的胜利推迟了二十多年。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，不但彻底完成了孙先生没有完成的民主革命，并且紧接着进行了社会主义革命。经过土地改革、农业合作化、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造和大跃进，在中国出现了一系列的奇迹。在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，中国人民发展农业，建设工业，取得了伟大的成就。前几天，我们又成功地完成导弹核武器的试验，使全世界反帝国主义的人民同声赞扬，使全靠核讹诈过日子的美国帝国主义和苏联修正主义吓得发抖。由于毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导，中国人民在短短的十七年内，做到了亚洲资本主义国家经历一百年、欧洲资本主义国家经历两百年才能做到的事。孙中山先生的建设中国的理想已经被伟大的毛主席领导下的中国人民远远地超过了。我九十岁了，我能目睹并亲自参加孙中山先生领导下的中国人民推翻清朝政府和国共合作举行北伐的两次大革命，又能目睹并亲自参加毛主席领导下的中国人民完成中国民主革命，彻底进行社会主义革命，为将来的共产主义打下基础，我是如何地幸福呵！
    特别使我在纪念孙中山先生诞生一百周年的时候，感到振奋的是，毛主席不以祖国的日益强大为满足，而且为了保证我们的祖国永远不变色，为了给全世界革命人民树立样板，他还亲自领导了史无前例的文化大革命。在中国，历史的车轮是前进得多么快啊！正当人们赞叹中国人民这样迅速掌握制造原子弹技术的时候，中国又出现了比原子弹试验更大的事件——文化大革命！中国人民以崭新的精神面貌，出现在世界舞台，全世界都在震惊。革命的人民在欢呼。反对革命的反动派在失魂丧魄。大家越来越清楚地看到，新中国的诞生和壮大，是在怎样深刻地影响着世界历史的进程。回想一百年前的中国，回想五十五年前辛亥革命时的中国，回想四十一年前孙先生逝世时的中国，今天的中国是多么不同啊！
    我老了。我能稍稍自慰的是，在民主主义革命阶段，我追随了孙中山先生，在社会主义革命阶段，我追随了毛主席。我现在学习孙中山先生，努力保持一个革命者的晚节。现在，文化大革命来了。这是决定中国命运，影响世界前途的大革命。尽管我九十岁了，我仍然有决心在文化大革命中努力跟上时代的要求，在这次大革命中继续保持革命晚节。我号召所有追随过孙中山先生的战友们，不要自馁，不要倚老卖老，不要一屁股坐在老资格的包袱上而寸步不前。我们要决心跟毛主席跟到底，继续改造自己，继续努力前进。我认为，只有这样，才是我们对孙中山先生和无数革命先烈、革命前辈的最好的纪念。（附图片）
