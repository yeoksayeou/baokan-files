Many Nepalese friends have warmly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

A writer recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Chairman Mao is the red sun that has risen in the East, illuminating wherever it shines. The Cultural Revolution in China is a brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Great Mao Zedong Thought will certainly triumph all over the world."

Another friend named Govinda said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has great significance for the people of the world. It gives hope and confidence to the people of the world who are fighting against imperialism and revisionism. He said, "Imperialism and modern revisionism, as well as all reactionaries, hope that the younger generation in China will undergo a 'peaceful evolution.' The Cultural Revolution has shattered the imperialists' and revisionists' foolish dreams. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, China will never change color; it will forever remain red and will forever be the center of opposition to imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism."

Govinda said: "I love the Red Guards very much. They are Chairman Mao's good soldiers. They are the excellent youth of the world's revolutionary people. Their actions are praiseworthy."

A worker from southern Nepal said, "I love Chairman Mao dearly. Chairman Mao is the greatest leader in the world. The Chinese people have shown fearless revolutionary spirit in the Cultural Revolution, which inspires all the people of the world."

    尼泊尔朋友热情赞扬毛主席的好战士
    红卫兵是世界人民的优秀青年一代
    新华社加德满都十八日电　许多尼泊尔朋友热烈赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    一位作家最近对新华社记者说，毛主席是在东方升起的红太阳，照到那里那里亮。中国的文化大革命是毛泽东思想的辉煌胜利。伟大的毛泽东思想一定会在全世界胜利。
    另一位名叫戈文达的朋友说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命对世界人民有巨大意义。它给予正在进行反对帝国主义和修正主义斗争的世界人民以希望和信心。他说，帝国主义和现代修正主义以及一切反动派希望中国的年青一代发生“和平演变”，文化大革命打破了帝国主义和修正主义的这个痴心妄想。在毛主席的领导下，中国永远不会改变颜色，它将永远保持红色，永远是反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义和反对修正主义的中心。
    戈文达说：“我很爱红卫兵。他们是毛主席的好战士。他们是世界革命人民中优秀的青年一代。他们的行动是值得赞扬的。”
    尼泊尔南部的一位工人说，我无限热爱毛主席。毛主席是世界上最伟大的领袖。中国人民在文化革命中显示了无畏的革命精神，这种精神是对全世界人民的鼓舞。
