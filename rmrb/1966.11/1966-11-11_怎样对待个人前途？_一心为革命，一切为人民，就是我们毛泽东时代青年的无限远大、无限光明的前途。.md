How to view one's personal future?

	To dedicate oneself wholeheartedly to the revolution and to serve the people wholeheartedly is the boundless and bright future of the youth in the era of Mao Zedong.

	Class Leader ZHAO Yingtang

	I come from a poor peasant family. In 1962, when I was about to graduate from high school and prepare for college entrance exams, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were loudly calling for a counterattack against the mainland. I volunteered to join the People's Liberation Army. At that time, on one hand, I hated the old society and the Kuomintang reactionaries, who wanted to return to power. I would not allow it, and I wanted to fulfill my duty to defend the motherland and repay the Party and Chairman Mao for liberating my family. On the other hand, I thought that serving for three years and then returning to take the college entrance exams would not be too late, and that after a few years of training in the army, I would have better conditions for taking the college entrance exams. Because of these selfish thoughts, for a long time after enlisting, I could not concentrate all my energy on revolutionary work.

	Later, with the help of leaders and comrades, I repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." Chairman Mao's teachings made me understand that as a revolutionary soldier, to correctly view one's personal future, one should be like Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, living for the people and dying for the people; one should wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people and the people of the world, and carry the proletarian revolution through to the end. From then on, I concentrated all my energy on studying Chairman Mao's works, strengthening my ideological transformation, and doing a good job on all the tasks assigned by the Party. Last year, I was evaluated as an outstanding soldier for the first time, and recently I was honored to join the Communist Party of China.

	Why did I, a poor boy, not want to be an ordinary soldier? The nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution helped me find the answer: I am a victim of the old educational system. In school, some bourgeois intellectuals often instilled in us the reactionary idea of "all professions are inferior, only reading is superior," advising us to "study hard now, go to college in the future, and become experts," leading us down the path of bourgeois individualism. The reason I did not want to be an ordinary soldier and looked down on so-called ordinary work was that I had been poisoned by their ideas. The bourgeoisie is trying to use these things to pull young people away through "peaceful evolution," cultivate their successors, and create conditions for the restoration of capitalism. If we are not vigilant and do not resolutely fight against bourgeois ideology, then as Chairman Mao said: "In a few years or a dozen years, or in several dozen years, it will inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration... the whole of China will change color." Upon careful consideration, Chairman Mao's words are very correct.

	Once poisoned, one must be thoroughly detoxified. The bourgeoisie launches an attack on us, and we must thoroughly smash it. Recently, in connection with the current class struggle situation, I have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and I feel much clearer in my mind. I am determined to redouble my efforts to study Chairman Mao's works, arm my mind with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly eliminate individualist thoughts from my mind, always listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, and wholeheartedly serve the people. I deeply feel that: dedicating oneself wholeheartedly to the revolution and to the people is the boundless and bright future of the youth in the era of Mao Zedong.

    怎样对待个人前途？
    一心为革命，一切为人民，就是我们毛泽东时代青年的无限远大、无限光明的前途。
    班长  赵应堂
    我出身贫农家庭。一九六二年，正当我高中毕业准备考大学的时候，蒋匪帮疯狂地叫嚣要反攻大陆，我报名参加了人民解放军。当时，一方面，痛恨旧社会，痛恨国民党反动派，它们要卷土重来，我决不答应，我要履行保卫祖国的职责，报答党和毛主席解放我全家的恩情；另一方面，我想，服役三年回来考大学还不晚，而且在部队锻炼几年，考大学更有条件了。由于存在这种私心杂念，入伍以后很长一段时间，不能把精力完全集中到革命工作上。
    后来，在领导和同志的热情帮助下，我反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《将革命进行到底》等文章。毛主席的谆谆教导，使我懂得作为一个革命战士，要正确对待个人前途，就应该像张思德、白求恩那样，为人民而生，为人民而死；就应该全心全意地为中国人民和全世界人民服务，把无产阶级革命进行到底。从此，我就把全部精力集中到学习毛主席著作上，加强自己的思想改造，努力做好党交给的各项工作。去年，我第一次被评上了五好战士，最近又光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    像我这样的穷孩子，为什么会不安心当普通一兵呢？全国轰轰烈烈开展的无产阶级文化大革命，使我进一步找到了答案：我是旧教育制度的受害者。学校里一些资产阶级知识分子，经常向我们灌输“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的反动思想，劝我们“现在好好读书，将来考大学，当专家”，把我们向资产阶级个人主义的道路上引导。我所以不愿当普通一兵，看不起所谓平凡的工作，就是中了他们的毒。资产阶级就是企图通过这些东西，用“和平演变”的方法，把青年拉走，培养他们的接班人，为资本主义复辟准备条件。如果我们不警惕，不坚决同资产阶级思想作斗争，那就正如毛主席所说：“少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟……整个中国就要改变颜色了。”仔细一想，毛主席说的很对。
    中了毒，就要彻底消毒。资产阶级向我们发动进攻，我们就要彻底粉碎它。最近，我结合当前阶级斗争的情况，反复地学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，觉得心里更亮堂了。我决心加倍努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，彻底扫除自己头脑中的个人主义思想，永远听党和毛主席的话，全心全意地为人民服务。我深深地体会到：一心为革命，一心为人民，这就是我们毛泽东时代青年的无限远大、无限光明的前途。
