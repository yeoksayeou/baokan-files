Title: Setting Out from Tiananmen Square

Edition: 2

The red flag billows, and the song resounds,
Spirits soar, and willpower is high.
The young pioneers of the Long March are setting out,
Once again, they arrive at Tiananmen Square.

Revisiting the directive to "resolutely carry out the task,"
Singing once more, "Mao Zedong Thought is the sun that never sets!"
Bathed in the radiant sunlight from the Tiananmen Gate,
Steel-like vows echo by the Golden Water Bridge:
The Little Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao's words,
Bravely stepping into the classroom of class struggle!
Through storms and tempests, we press on,
Unfazed by towering waves and surging tides!

Forever loyal to the most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!
Forever loyal to the greatest Mao Zedong Thought!

    从天安门前出发
    陈诗信诗　吴敏画红旗漫卷歌声扬，意气风发斗志昂。长征小将要上路，再一次来到天安门广场。重温一次“下定决心”的最高指示，再唱一遍“毛泽东思想是不落的太阳！”披着天安门城楼射出的灿烂阳光，钢铁的誓言在金水桥畔回响：红小兵最听毛主席的话，勇敢地迈进阶级斗争的大课堂！狂风暴雨不回头，惊涛骇浪无阻挡！永远忠于最敬爱的领袖毛主席！永远忠于最伟大的毛泽东思想！
