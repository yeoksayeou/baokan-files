The current struggle of revolutionary people worldwide against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries is in a very favorable situation. China, which insists on revolution, will never be isolated, the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people will never be extinguished, and the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries will definitely be victorious.

New China News Agency, November 29th: Premier Zhou Enlai said tonight that we are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The days of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are getting worse. The future of the world belongs to the people of the world, and our prospects are limitless and bright.

Premier Zhou Enlai strongly condemned the intensified collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people and isolate revolutionary China. He said, "We must warn the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership: your plots will never succeed."

Premier Zhou Enlai made these remarks at a reception held by the Albanian Ambassador to China tonight to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of Albania's liberation.

Premier Zhou said in his speech, "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The current struggle of revolutionary people worldwide against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries is in a very favorable situation.

"The ranks of Marxism-Leninism are continuously expanding and growing stronger. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America is achieving one victory after another. The revolutionary movements of the people in various countries, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are flourishing. The days of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are getting worse."

Premier Zhou pointed out, "In order to prolong its precarious existence on the Vietnamese battlefield, U.S. imperialism is intensifying its counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. The Manila Conference and Johnson's visit to Asia are new steps to further expand the war in Vietnam and peddle the 'peace talks' deception."

He said, "The Soviet revisionist leadership actively serves as a henchman for U.S. imperialism, intensifying its collusion with the United States, 'easing' the European situation, helping the United States increase troops in Vietnam; plotting and promoting various 'peace talks' deceptions; and conspiring to use so-called 'joint actions' to control Vietnam, sow discord among the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples' fighting unity, and undermine the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America from within. Recently, the Soviet leadership has also used some party congresses to launch a new wave of anti-China attacks, attempting to cooperate with the United States to realize the plot to isolate and strike China."

Premier Zhou emphasized, "We must warn the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership: your plots will never succeed. China, which insists on revolution, will never be isolated, the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people will never be extinguished, and the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries will definitely be victorious. The future of the world belongs to the people of the world, and our prospects are limitless and bright."

    周恩来总理严正警告美帝和苏修  你们的反革命阴谋永远不会得逞
    当前全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，呈现着一片大好形势。坚持革命的中国永远不会孤立，越南人民的革命战火永远扑灭不了，各国人民的革命斗争一定要胜利。
    新华社二十九日讯　周恩来总理今晚说，我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的日子越来越不好过。世界的未来是属于世界人民的，我们的前途是无限光明的。
    周恩来总理强烈谴责美苏加紧勾结，妄图扑灭越南人民的革命战火，孤立坚持革命的中国。他说：“我们要正告美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团：你们的阴谋是永远不会得逞的。”
    周恩来总理是在阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使今晚举行的庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十二周年招待会上讲这些话的。
    周总理在讲话中说：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。当前全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，呈现着一片大好形势。
    “马克思列宁主义的队伍正在不断发展壮大，越南人民的抗美救国战争取得一个又一个的胜利，世界各国特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民的革命运动，正在蓬勃发展。美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的日子越来越不好过。”
    周总理指出：“美帝国主义为了苟延在越南战场上岌岌可危的命运，正在加紧推行反革命两手策略。马尼拉会议和约翰逊的亚洲之行，就是进一步扩大侵越战争和兜售‘和谈’骗局的新步骤。”
    他说：“苏联修正主义领导集团积极充当美帝国主义的帮凶，加紧同美国勾结，‘和缓’欧洲局势，帮助美国增兵越南；策划和推销种种‘和谈’骗局；并且阴谋用所谓‘联合行动’来控制越南，挑拨中越人民的战斗团结，从内部来破坏越南人民的抗美救国战争。最近，苏共领导集团还利用一些党的代表大会，大肆攻击中国共产党，掀起新的反华浪潮，妄图配合美国实现孤立和打击中国的阴谋。”
    周总理强调说：“我们要正告美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团：你们的阴谋是永远不会得逞的。坚持革命的中国永远不会孤立，越南人民的革命战火永远扑灭不了，各国人民的革命斗争一定要胜利。世界的未来是属于世界人民的，我们的前途是无限光明的。”
