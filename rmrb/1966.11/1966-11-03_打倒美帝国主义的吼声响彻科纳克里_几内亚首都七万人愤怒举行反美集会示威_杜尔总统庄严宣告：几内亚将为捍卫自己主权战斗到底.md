	The shouts to overthrow American imperialism echoed through Conakry. Seven hundred thousand people in the capital of Guinea held an angry rally and demonstration against the U.S.

	On November 1, 70,000 citizens of Conakry gathered at the "September 28th" Stadium to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Army of Guinea. The people of Guinea expressed their firm resolve to fight American imperialism to the end and to defend their national sovereignty and dignity.

	The rally began with shouts of "Down with imperialism!" "Down with colonialism!" "Down with neo-colonialism!" and "Long live the revolution!" The crowd expressed their great anger and strong protest against the bandit-like actions of the U.S. government in colluding with the reactionary regime of Ghana to kidnap the Guinean delegation.

	President Sekou Toure, in his speech at the rally, angrily denounced the U.S. government for ignoring the demands of the Guinean government and refusing to fulfill its obligations. He said that the U.S. government had unlawfully abducted the Guinean delegation, which was passing through Accra, the capital of Ghana, and refused to send them safely to Addis Ababa. President Sekou Toure continued, "The Political Bureau of the Democratic Party of Guinea and the Guinean government will take necessary measures. If the U.S. government forces us to do so, Guinea, like the people of other countries, will not allow anyone to trample on our dignity and sovereignty."

	President Toure solemnly declared, "Guinea will fight to the last person to defend its sovereignty and national dignity."

	After the rally, a grand military parade and mass procession were held. Over 5,000 men and women in military uniform, armed with weapons, marched in orderly rows past the central review stand. They held up banners with slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with the American bastards!" "The African people will be victorious!" and "Smash the plots and tricks of American imperialism and its Accra puppets!"

	Currently, Ghanaians in Guinea also participated in the procession. They held up portraits of President Sekou Toure and Dr. Nkrumah, as well as banners with slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with the American bastards!" and "American bastards, get out of Africa!" They marched past the central review stand, expressing their determination to join their Guinean brothers in overthrowing their common enemy, American imperialism.

    打倒美帝国主义的吼声响彻科纳克里
    几内亚首都七万人愤怒举行反美集会示威

    新华社科纳克里一日电　几内亚首都科纳克里七万多市民一日在“九月二十八日”体育场举行盛大集会，庆祝几内亚人民军建军八周年。会上，几内亚人民表达了坚决同美帝国主义斗争到底和捍卫国家主权和民族尊严的坚强意志。
    集会在高呼“打倒帝国主义！”“打倒殖民主义！”“打倒新殖民主义！”和“革命万岁！”等口号声中开始，到会群众对美帝国主义伙同加纳反动当局绑架几内亚代表团的强盗行径表示极大愤怒和强烈抗议。
    塞古·杜尔总统在集会上讲话时，愤怒谴责美国政府不顾几内亚政府的要求，无理拒绝履行它应承担的义务，把路过加纳首都阿克拉被非法绑架的几内亚代表团安全送到亚的斯亚贝巴去。塞古·杜尔总统接着说：“几内亚民主党全国政治局和几内亚政府将采取必要的决定，如果美国政府迫使我们这样做的话，几内亚像其他国家人民一样，决不容许别人蹂躏自己的尊严和主权。”
    杜尔总统庄严宣告：“几内亚将为捍卫自己的主权和民族尊严战斗到最后一个人。”
    集会以后，举行了盛大的阅兵式和群众游行。五千多名身穿军装、手持武器的男女民兵，迈着整齐的步伐，一队接一队地从中央检阅台前通过。他们高举着的标语牌上写着：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒美国佬！”“非洲人民必胜！”“粉碎美帝国主义及其阿克拉傀儡的阴谋诡计！”等口号。
    目前正在几内亚的加纳人也参加了这次游行。他们举着塞古·杜尔总统和恩克鲁玛博士的画像和“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒美国佬！”“美国佬滚出非洲去！”等标语牌，从中央检阅台前面通过，表示他们与兄弟的几内亚人民一起打倒他们共同的敌人美帝国主义的决心。
