Our brigade has high mountains and steep slopes, all of which are dry fields with thin soil, and the production conditions are very poor. When it comes to changing the production situation, some community members say, "Our conditions are poor, what if things don't go well?" In response to this situation, we repeatedly organized community members to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and combined it with our actual situation for discussion. The community members' socialist consciousness and revolutionary spirit were greatly enhanced. They said: "We are not poor in conditions, but poor in ideology." "It doesn't matter if the place is poor, but we must not let our ideology be poor." "If our ideology is not poor, a poor place can become a rich place; if our ideology is poor, a poor place will remain poor forever."

"The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" educated the broad community members. After repeated discussions, we formulated a seven-year plan for the construction of Yingpan Head. Starting from 1964, we worked hard and diligently to gradually solve the three problems of drought, thin soil, and lack of arable land. In 1964 and 1965, grain production achieved a bumper harvest, and there was enough for self-sufficiency. Last year, we also sold 6,000 pounds of surplus grain to the state. The living standards of the community members have also improved, and now most families have savings.

This spring, the drought is severe. Should we be defeated by this "enemy," or should we unite to overcome it? Most people believe that we must overcome the drought and achieve a bumper harvest. But a few people lack confidence. To fight, we must first start with people's ideology. In response to the few community members' fear of difficulties, we studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" again, studying it more than ten times. Everyone's ideology became unified, and their willpower became consistent. Community member Ran Guangqiang said: "In the most difficult times, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Achieving a bumper harvest in a drought year is true skill."

In this way, we searched all the nearby eight caves on the mountain and found water. Everyone carried water buckets up the mountain. The community members were very enthusiastic, and this year, although it was a drought year, we started sowing twenty days earlier than in previous years.

    听毛主席的话，把困难斗倒
    贵州思南县三溪公社营盘头生产队队长  冉光祥
    我们队山高坡陡，都是旱田薄土，生产条件很不好。一说改变生产面貌，有些社员就说，咱们条件差，闹不好。针对这个情况，我们反复组织社员学习《愚公移山》，结合实际，进行讨论。社员们的社会主义觉悟和革命干劲大大提高了，他们说：“我们不是条件差，是思想差。”“地方穷不要紧，就怕人的思想穷。”“思想不穷，穷地方能变成富地方，思想穷，穷地方就会永远穷下去。”
    《愚公移山》教育了广大社员，经过大家反复讨论，我们制定了一个建设营盘头的七年规划。从一九六四年起，穷干苦干，逐步解决干旱、土薄、耕地少三个问题。一九六四年和一九六五年粮食获得了大丰收，自给有余，去年还卖了六千斤余粮给国家。社员生活也提高了，现在大多数人家都有存款。
    今年春天天旱，是被这个
  “敌人”压倒，还是大家齐心把它斗倒呢？大多数都认为，必须斗倒干旱，夺取丰收。但有少数人信心不足。斗，首先要从人的思想斗起。针对少数社员中的畏难思想，我们又学习了《愚公移山》，一连学了十几次。大家思想一致了，意志统一了。社员冉光强说：“在最困难的时候，更要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。干旱年夺取丰收，才算真本领。”
    这样，我们跑遍了附近山上的八个溶洞，找到了水，每个人都担着水桶上山挑水。社员们干劲很大，今年虽然天旱，却比往年提前二十天下种。
