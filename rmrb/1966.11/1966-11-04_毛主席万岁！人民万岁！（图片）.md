Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao come to Tiananmen Gate. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the eternal red sun in our hearts. We will always follow you, daring to brave mountains of knives and seas of fire!

Chairman Mao ascends Tiananmen Gate, and a red sun rises in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. A thousand words and ten thousand words cannot express our love for you. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. March forward with the red flag held high, our hearts unchanging even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble.

Dearest Leader Chairman Mao, please rest assured, we will resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line that you represent, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely follow your instructions: pay attention to national affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.
