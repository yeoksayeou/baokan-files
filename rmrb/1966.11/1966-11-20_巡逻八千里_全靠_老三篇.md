The editorial board: With boundless excitement, we introduce an excellent article on the practical application of the "Three Articles" in the struggle. Red Guards who are preparing to travel the entire country on foot and revolutionary young people across the nation, after reading this article, you will surely benefit greatly.

Look! This small detachment of the People's Liberation Army, with such strong class feelings, with such astonishing willpower, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works in the midst of their duties! They were able to endure extreme fatigue, overcome countless difficulties, and successfully complete the honorable task of patrolling 8,000 li on foot in deserts and saline-alkali areas with scarce water sources, all thanks to the invincible great thought of Mao Zedong.

The glorious deeds of this detachment once again prove: Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength for us to overcome any difficulty and achieve every victory.

Today, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of our country have achieved great victories in the people's revolutionary wars and have made tremendous achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past seventeen years. At the same time, under the personal leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out victoriously. The revolutionary situation across the country is excellent, and our future is bright and boundless.

Chairman Mao often teaches us: The road ahead is not smooth. We must be prepared to overcome one difficulty after another and seize one great victory after another. This requires us to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high tide, to draw boundless strength from Chairman Mao's works, to firmly establish the great aspirations of the proletariat, to dare to tread paths where no one has gone before, and to dare to scale peaks that no one has reached. We must build our socialist China, which has one-fourth of the world's population, into an iron fortress of the proletariat that will never change color.

Red Army Not Afraid of Long March Difficulties

When I was a soldier in the guard company, I participated in a patrol mission with a small detachment. This patrol covered over 8,000 li, all through deserts, salt flats, and marshes, where vehicles could not pass, and we had to rely on foot travel. The commanding officers briefed us on the mission, saying: This mission is very important and arduous, and we must be prepared to endure great hardships and labor. In the course of executing the mission, we will definitely encounter many difficulties. What should we do when faced with difficulties? The only way is to study Chairman Mao's works and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

After receiving the mission, I felt both happy and worried. I was happy because I was the only new soldier in the detachment. The leadership trusted me and assigned me such an arduous mission; I was worried because I lacked training, and could I really walk 8,000 li? The places we were going to were desolate, with no water sources, what should we do? What if we got sick? What if we encountered wild beasts? A series of questions swirled in my mind. With the fear of not completing the mission and the fear of sacrifice, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people's interests." I thought, this patrol mission is a serious test for me, and I must follow Chairman Mao's teachings to truly serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." As for the issue of sacrifice, Chairman Mao said: "To struggle is to sacrifice," and "to die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists, to die for those who exploit and oppress the people, is lighter than a feather." Comrade Zhang Zedong, after the Long March of 25,000 li, went to make charcoal for the people's needs and sacrificed himself. Chairman Mao said his death was heavier than Mount Tai. I should learn from the revolutionary martyrs, strive to learn their spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, and bravely overcome any great difficulties.

Nothing is Impossible, as Long as You Dare to Strive

We began to execute the patrol mission. First, we found a place with a water source and established a living point. We stored our food and other items that were not needed immediately there. On the first day, we set out from the living point, each carrying guns, ammunition, bedding, food, etc., with a total load of over seventy jin. The weather was very hot, and we walked under the scorching sun. By noon, the two bottles of water we carried had been drunk dry. We found a water source in the afternoon and cooked a meal. However, the water was bitter and salty, and no one wanted to eat the cooked rice. The commander ordered everyone to treat eating as a mission to be completed. Due to the inability to adapt to the bitter water, everyone had diarrhea. By evening, we gathered to study Chairman Mao's works and summarize the experiences of the first day's patrol.

On the second day, we continued our march. As soon as I put on my backpack, I felt it was very heavy. Along the way, I kept thinking, can we really endure this day after day? I even fantasized that the commanding officers would suddenly change their minds and cancel the patrol mission. During a rest, I studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Chairman Mao said: "Have the courage to face any difficulties and to overcome every obstacle to win victory." The seventeen shining words were like spring thunder, awakening me. Should I follow Chairman Mao's teachings to overcome difficulties and strive for victory? Or should I be crushed by difficulties and not be able to hold my head up? I thought: The Party and Chairman Mao, for the liberation of the working people, endured countless hardships and overthrew the three great mountains that had been oppressing the Chinese people. I had only patrolled for a day or two and was already frightened by difficulties. How could I be called a revolutionary soldier taught by Chairman Mao? Chairman Mao's words gave me boundless strength. I walked and recited these seventeen words, and by evening, I did not feel too tired. That night, the weather suddenly changed, and a cold front brought a strong wind of about level ten. Surrounding us was a vast plain with no place to shelter from the wind. When we set up camp, we lay on a layer of felt and covered ourselves with a yellow quilt, but we were still frozen and curled up. The next morning, we found that the quilt was almost completely buried by sand and small stones. Although the wind had stopped, the sound of the wind still echoed in our ears.

In this way, we patrolled for five or six days, and everyone became thin. The water became more bitter, and the difficulties increased. In this situation, we insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works every day and used Chairman Mao's teachings to encourage ourselves. Although the environment was harsh, everyone was full of revolutionary optimism. Everyone said: "The revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people. Today, losing a few jin of flesh is nothing!"

On May 1st, we celebrated the great International Labor Day in a distant border area. That day, we gathered together and held a commemorative meeting. When comrades talked about how our Party and Chairman Mao led the people of the whole country to overcome numerous difficulties and achieve great successes in socialist revolution and socialist construction, we felt boundless joy and excitement. We wished Chairman Mao eternal life and wished our socialist motherland prosperity and prosperity.

This stage of the patrol gave me great training and testing. I summarized one experience: No matter how great the difficulties, as long as we have Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome them. No matter how difficult the desert is, as long as we study Chairman Mao's works, we can walk through it.

The Ten Thousand Rivers and Mountains Are Just a Joke

Later, the patrol missions became more arduous, and the difficulties increased. The places we walked through sometimes had a foot-deep layer of old alkali, sometimes required crossing several mountain ridges, and sometimes were endless reed marshes. One day, we waded through forty-eight streams, most of which were about ten meters wide, and the deepest places were impassable with our belongings. To avoid one stream, we had to walk for several hours. For many years, the reeds grew and rotted, rotted and grew, all rotting in the water. The water was black and smelly. There were many mosquitoes, and they bit our faces swollen. In the evening, the wind blew again, and soon it rained heavily. We covered our weapons, ammunition, backpacks, and food with raincoats. Everyone huddled together, sitting in the pouring rain. Unable to sleep, we talked about our family histories and denounced the darkness of the old society. That night, I told my comrades about my own family history: When I was young, I went begging with my mother, and we also encountered such heavy rain. Mother and child had no place to hide and stood under the eaves of a landlord's house with the door tightly closed, soaked to the skin. In the past, the suffering of being oppressed by the exploiting class had nowhere to vent. Today, although the rain is heavier, the nature of the suffering is completely different. I have turned over, become a soldier of the people, and for the revolutionary interests of the people of the whole country and the world, and for the sake of our descendants not suffering, no matter how hard and tired I am, my heart is happy.

The next day, the rain had not stopped. We lifted the raincoats to find that everything was soaked, the flour and biscuits in the food bag had turned into porridge, and the weight of the quilt had doubled. On the way back, each person carried over a hundred jin of belongings. There was a section of saline-alkali land, and after the rain, the surface was hard, but the bottom turned into mud, sinking to the knees, and it was hard to pull out the legs. At this time, we sang Chairman Mao's Long March poem: "The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of the Long March, ten thousand rivers and mountains are just a joke..." We used revolutionary optimism to encourage ourselves.

For the next few days of the patrol, it was all marshland, with endless reed marshes. The reeds were very dense, and we had to use both hands to part them, and only after trampling them down could we move forward. The reed leaves were like knives, cutting our hands and tearing our military uniforms. One comrade's two trouser legs were completely torn off, and the medical orderly wrapped his legs with gauze.

Under such difficult conditions, we never stopped studying Chairman Mao's works. Each time we studied, we gained a little more strength to overcome difficulties. Every time we thought of Chairman Mao leading the Red Army on the Long March and the revolutionary martyrs fighting bravely, we suddenly felt full of strength, as if Chairman Mao was standing in front of us, encouraging us to move forward.

In Front of Those Armed with Mao Zedong Thought

Hardships Must Bow Their Heads, Difficulties Must Give Way

One day, we went to patrol an ancient kingdom's ruins. This ancient fortress was twenty kilometers away from the water spring. Each of us carried two bottles of water and decided to return to the water spring to camp at night. The terrain in that area was particularly complex, with reed marshes, deep gullies, and primitive forests. After many years of weathering, the trees were all withered and crumbly, and a footstep would sink a foot deep. It took us thirteen hours to reach the destination. The two bottles of water were almost finished, and although our stomachs were growling with hunger, no one could eat the hard biscuits.

After completing the patrol mission, we decided to return to the water spring immediately. At this time, it was already a starry night. On the desert, it was difficult to distinguish directions during the day, and at night, it was hard to see far, and there were no landmarks to judge the position. We relied on the compass and the North Star to walk through the night. When it was dawn, we looked at the terrain and found it was wrong. We had lost our way and walked into a completely unfamiliar area. This place was equally distant from the water spring and the ancient fortress. We had not eaten for a day and a night, and the entire detachment was left with only half a bottle of vinegar-like sour water. Everyone was tired and hungry, and if they sat down, they could not stand up without help.

Serious difficulties were in front of us. The party cell held an emergency meeting, requiring everyone to continue to insist and seek guidance from Chairman Mao's works when faced with difficulties. The party organization's words reminded us, and everyone took out the selected readings of Chairman Mao's works for soldiers. As soon as we saw the red cover, we immediately gained boundless strength. This red and shining book has guided us to overcome so many difficulties! Today, only Mao Zedong Thought can guide us to break through all difficulties and achieve victory. Although I was so thirsty that I could not speak, I still read aloud several times a passage from Chairman Mao's teachings: "Thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests and bravely fought in front of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward in their blood!" Chairman Mao is right. Countless martyrs' sacrifices are for the liberation of all mankind. We should continue to hold high the revolutionary banner and march forward. For the sake of completing the mission assigned by the Party, we will crawl forward even if we have to, and even if we die, our bodies will fall forward. The commander gave the order to set out, and everyone was spirited and marched towards the water spring.

After walking for a while, some comrades had fallen several times. The remaining half bottle of water was drunk under the commander's order, with everyone pushing and letting each other. After resting, we studied Chairman Mao's works and recalled the heroic deeds of the Shangganling Battle. The heroes who defended Shangganling had no water to drink, and two apples were passed around the entire battlefield, but no one took a bite, and they still insisted on fighting against American imperialism. What are our difficulties compared to this? Insist, and victory is ours.

By the afternoon, we were only two or three kilometers away from the water spring, and the marker of the water spring was already visible. However, these two or three kilometers were so far away! We really had no strength to walk any further. I proposed to the commander: I and two other comrades will go to fetch water empty-handed, and the others will wait here. However, no one was willing to stay. Everyone stood up with difficulty, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands, looking at the red cover, and letting the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought guide us forward. The two or three kilometers took us three hours to walk.

When we reached the water spring, we dipped our heads in the water and drank our fill, and ate some biscuits. At this time, I thought, Chairman Mao, you seemed to know decades ago that we would undertake this arduous patrol mission and wrote a treasure book for the successors of our revolution. Without your teachings, we would not have been able to complete this mission. I deeply felt: Revolutionary soldiers can go without water when thirsty, without food when hungry, and without rest when tired, but not for a moment can they be separated from Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, any hardship and difficulty can be overcome, and any miracle in the world can be created.

In the six months of the patrol mission, we walked over 8,400 li, and each person wore out seven pairs of shoes. It was also in this arduous patrol mission that I was honored to join the great Communist Party of China. This is an event in my life that I will never forget.

    巡逻八千里  全靠“老三篇”
    解放军某部班长　潘友功
    编者按：我们以无限兴奋的心情，向大家介绍一篇在斗争中活学活用“老三篇”的好文章。准备全程步行串连的红卫兵战士和广大革命青少年们，你们看了这篇文章，一定可以得到教益。
      请看！这支解放军的小分队，他们怀着多么强烈的阶级感情，以多么惊人的毅力，坚持在执勤中活学活用毛主席著作啊！他们所以能够忍受极度疲劳，战胜千难万苦，在缺少水源的沙漠和盐碱地带，胜利完成了徒步巡逻八千里的光荣任务，完全靠的是战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想。
    这支小分队的光辉事迹，再一次证明：毛泽东思想是我们战胜任何困难，取得一切胜利的力量源泉。
    今天，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我国人民已经取得了人民革命战争的伟大胜利，取得了十七年来的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就。同时，在伟大统帅毛主席的亲自领导下，一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利开展。全国的革命形势大好，我们的前途无限光明。
      毛主席经常教导我们：前进的道路并不是平坦的。我们还要准备战胜一个又一个困难，夺取一个又一个更加伟大的胜利。这就特别需要我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新高潮，从毛主席著作中汲取无穷的力量，大立无产阶级的雄心壮志，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。我们一定要把占世界人口四分之一的社会主义中国建设好，使它成为无产阶级的铁打的江山，永不变色。
        红军不怕远征难
    我在警卫连当战士的时候，参加了一次小分队巡逻任务。这次巡逻行程八千多里，全是沙漠、碱滩和沼泽，不能行车，全靠步行。部队首长向我们交代任务时说：这个任务很重要，很艰巨，要准备吃大苦耐大劳。在执行任务的过程中，一定会遇到很多困难。有了困难怎么办？唯一的办法，就是学习毛主席著作，按照毛主席的指示去办。
    受领任务以后，我又高兴又担心。高兴的是小分队里，只有我是新兵。领导上信任自己，才让我执行这样艰巨的任务；担心的是自己缺乏锻炼，步行八千多里，能走得下来吗？去的地方荒无人烟，没有水怎么办？生了病怎么办？遇上野兽怎么办？一系列的问题在我脑子里打转。我带着怕完不成任务和怕牺牲的问题，学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我想，这次巡逻任务就是对我的一次严重考验，我一定要按照毛主席的教导，真正做到
  “完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务。至于牺牲的问题，毛主席说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲”，“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”张思德同志经过二万五千里长征，为了人民需要去烧炭，牺牲了。毛主席说他死的比泰山还重。我应该以革命先烈为榜样，努力学习他们一不怕苦二不怕死的革命精神，勇于克服任何巨大的困难。
        世上无难事，只要肯登攀
    开始执行巡逻任务了。我们首先找了个有水源的地方，建立了生活点。把粮食和暂时不用的东西放在那里。第一天，我们从生活点出发，每人携带枪支、弹药、被服、粮食等，共荷重七十多斤。天气很热，顶着烈日走呀走呀，到中午时刻，随身携带的两壶水已经喝得净光。下午才找到了水源，支锅做饭。但是水是苦咸苦咸的，做出的饭谁也不想吃。队长要求大家把吃饭当作任务来完成。由于不适应苦水，大家都泻起肚子来。到了傍晚，我们一起学习了毛主席著作，总结了第一天巡逻的经验。
    第二天继续行军，我一背起背包就觉得很沉。一路走一路想，这样一天天地走，能坚持下来吗？我甚至幻想过，首长会突然改变决心，取消巡逻任务。休息时，我学习了《愚公移山》。毛主席说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”十七个闪闪发光的字，像春雷一样惊醒了我。是按照毛主席的教导，去排除万难争取胜利呢？还是让困难压得抬不起头来？我想：党和毛主席为了争取劳动人民的解放，吃尽千难万苦，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，我才巡逻了一天多，就被困难吓住，怎么能称得起是毛主席教导的革命战士呢？毛主席的话，给我增添了无穷的力量。我边走边念这十七个字，走到傍晚也没觉得太累。晚上，天气突然变化，寒流袭来，刮起了十级左右的大风。周围一片平川，连个避风的地方也没有。宿营的时候，身下垫一层羊毛毡，上面盖一床黄被子，还冻得缩成一团。第二天一看，被子几乎全被沙土和小石子埋住了。风虽然停了，耳朵里仍然响着呼呼的风声。
    就这样巡逻了五、六天，同志们都消瘦下来。水越来越苦，困难也越来越多。在这种情况下，我们每天坚持学习毛主席著作，用毛主席的教导鼓励自己。虽然环境艰苦，大家却充满了革命乐观主义精神。同志们都说：“革命先烈为人民献出了生命，我们今天掉几斤肉，又算得了什么！”
    五月一日，我们在遥远的边疆度过了伟大的国际劳动节。那天，大家围坐在一起，开了个纪念会。当同志们谈到，我们党和毛主席领导全国人民，战胜重重困难，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面，取得了巨大成就的时候，感到无限欢欣鼓舞。我们敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，祝社会主义祖国繁荣昌盛。
    这一阶段的巡逻，使我受到极大的锻炼和考验。我总结了一条体会：困难再大，只要有了毛泽东思想就能克服，沙漠再难走，只要学了毛主席著作就能走过去。
          万水千山只等闲
    以后的巡逻任务更艰巨，困难更多。我们走的地方，有时踏下去是一脚深的老碱皮，有时要连续翻过几道山岭，有时是一片茫无边缘的苇塘沼泽。有一天，我们整整涉过四十八道水，一般有十几米宽，最深的地方，带着东西就过不去。为了绕一道水，就要走好几个小时。多少年的芦苇长了又烂，烂了又长，都沤在水里。水又黑又臭。蚊子特别多，把我们的脸全咬肿了。傍晚又刮起了风，不久就下起大雨。我们用雨衣把武器弹药和背包、粮食全盖好。大家紧靠在一起，坐在大雨地里。没法睡觉，就谈家史，控诉旧社会的黑暗。在那天晚上，我向同志们讲了自己的家史：小时候跟着母亲去讨饭，也碰到过这样的倾盆大雨。母子俩没处藏身，站在紧闭着大门的地主的屋檐下，浑身淋得透湿。过去受剥削阶级的压迫，有苦没处诉。今天雨虽然更大，但是和旧社会受的苦性质完全不一样。自己已经翻了身，当了人民战士，为了全国人民和世界人民的革命利益，为了子孙后代不受苦，再苦再累，心里也是愉快的。
    第二天，雨还没停。我们掀起雨衣一看，东西全都湿透了，粮食袋里的面粉和饼干，已经成了浆糊，被子的重量也增加了一倍。在归途中，每人背了一百多斤重的东西。有一段盐碱地，下雨后，上面是硬的，下面变成泥浆，陷下去就没到膝盖，拔不出腿来。这时候，我们就唱毛主席的长征诗：“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲……”。用革命的乐观主义精神来鼓舞自己。
    以后几天的巡逻，完全是沼泽地带，一片苇塘望不到边。芦苇长得很密，得用双手拨开，把它踩倒后才能前进。苇叶像利刀一样划破了我们的双手，刮破了我们的军衣。有一个同志的两条裤腿完全被刮掉了，卫生员就用纱布把他的腿裹了起来。
    在这样困难的条件下，我们从未间断学习毛主席著作。每学习一次，就增加一分克服困难的力量。每一想到毛主席领导红军长征和革命先烈前赴后继英勇斗争的情形，顿时觉得浑身充满了力量，好像毛主席就站在我们面前，亲切地鼓励着我们前进。
    在用毛泽东思想武装起来的人面前
      艰苦就得低头，困难只能让路
    有一天，我们到一座古代王国的遗址去巡逻。这个古堡遗址离水泉二十多公里。我们每人带了两壶水，决定晚上返回水泉宿营。那一带地形特别复杂，除了苇塘，就是深沟断壁，原始森林。经过多少年的风化，树木全部枯酥了，一踩一脚深的风化层。走到目的地，就足足花了十三个小时。带的两壶水快要喝完了，虽然肚子饿得直叫，干硬干硬的饼干谁也吃不下去。
    我们完成了巡逻任务后，决定马上返回水泉。这时已经是满天星斗。在沙漠上，白天就很难辨别方向，晚上看不远，又没有地物可以判断方位，我们就依靠指北针和看着北极星走了一夜。天明了，一看地形不对，原来是迷失了方向，走到了一个完全陌生的地带。这里离水泉和古堡离水泉的距离几乎相等。一天一夜没吃东西了，整个小分队只剩下了半壶对了醋精的酸水，大家又累又饿，坐下去没有人扶就站不起来。
    严重的困难摆在面前。党小组召开了紧急会议，要求大家继续坚持，有了困难就向毛主席著作请教。党组织的话提醒了我们，大家拿出了毛主席著作战士选读本。一看到那红色的书面，立刻增添了无穷的力量。这本红光闪闪的书，指导着我们克服了多少困难！今天，也只有毛泽东思想才能指引我们冲破万难，夺取胜利。我虽然口渴得念不出声音，仍然小声地反复读了毛主席教导的一段话：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”毛主席说得对，无数先烈的牺牲，为的是获得全人类的解放。我们应该继续高举革命的旗帜前进。为了完成党交给的任务，我们就是爬着也要前进，就是死了也要身体倒向前方。队长说了声出发，大家又精神抖擞地向水泉前进了。
    走了没有多远，有的同志就摔倒了几次。剩下的半壶水，在队长的命令下，你推我让地喝完了。休息一次，我们就学习一次毛主席著作，回忆上甘岭战役的英雄事迹。坚守上甘岭的英雄们没有水喝，两个苹果传遍了整个阵地，谁也没有咬一口，仍然坚持和美帝国主义作战。我们这点困难算得了什么？坚持下去，就是胜利。
    走到下午三点多钟，离水泉只有两三公里，水泉的标记已经看到了。可是，这两三公里的路是多么遥远呵！实在没有力气再走了。我向队长提出：我和另外两个同志空身去取水，让其他同志坐在那里等。可是，谁也不肯留下。大家艰难地站起来，手里举着《毛主席语录》，看着红色的封面，让毛泽东思想的光辉引导着我们前进。两三公里路，我们一步一步地足足走了三个小时。
    到了水泉，我们把头浸在水里，饱饱地喝了一顿，吃了一些饼干。这时我想，毛主席呀毛主席，你老人家好像在几十年前就知道我们今天要执行艰巨的巡逻任务，为我们革命事业的接班人写下了宝书。要是没有你老人家的教导，我们就不可能完成这次任务。我深深地体会到：革命战士渴了可以不喝水，饿了可以不吃饭，累了可以不休息，但是一时一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想。只要有了毛泽东思想，什么艰苦困难都可以战胜，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。
    在六个月的巡逻任务中，我们步行了八千四百多里路，每个人磨破了七双鞋子。也就是在这次艰巨的巡逻任务中，我光荣的加入了伟大的中国共产党。这是我一生中永远不能忘怀的事。
