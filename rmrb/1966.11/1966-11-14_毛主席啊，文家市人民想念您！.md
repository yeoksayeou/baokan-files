Chairman Mao, the people of Wenjiashi miss you!

A twenty-mile-long red inspection avenue is adorned with waving flags and thunderous cheers. Millions of excited faces and millions of fervent hearts all turn towards the red sun in our hearts.

When Chairman Mao's open-top car slowly approached the entrance of the National Hotel, over forty revolutionary teachers and students from Wenjiashi, Hunan Province's Xiangtan County, looked up at the great leader's benevolent smile. They were so moved that their blood boiled and tears welled up in their eyes. They shouted and jumped, expressing a thousand words in one sentence: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Wenjiashi is the starting point of the march of the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops led by Chairman Mao to Jinggangshan.

In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, and dark clouds covered the entire country. In this critical moment, Chairman Mao led the famous Autumn Harvest Uprising. In September, Chairman Mao, dressed in a blue cloth jacket and wearing straw shoes, came to Wenjiashi. On September 20, he gathered the troops and gave a speech. With a powerful voice, he analyzed the situation at the time, pointed out the bright future, and emphasized the importance of building a strong revolutionary armed force. He encouraged everyone not to be disheartened, saying, "Everything is difficult at the beginning." To make a revolution, one must not fear difficulties. As long as we grit our teeth and get through this, the revolution will have a day to shine! A few days later, Chairman Mao personally led the troops from here, went through the Sanwan reorganization, and arrived at Jinggangshan in October, establishing China's first rural revolutionary base, opening the path to victory for the Chinese revolution.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, has been away from heroic Wenjiashi for over thirty years. However, every brick and tile here records Chairman Mao's great achievements, and every blade of grass and tree is bathed in the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, the revolutionary people here miss you every moment!

In mid-October this year, the revolutionary teachers and students of Wenjiashi Middle School were selected to send representatives to Beijing to visit Chairman Mao. This good news quickly spread throughout the villages. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Wenjiashi ran to tell each other, cheering and jumping. Some production teams even specially convened meetings of poor and lower-middle peasants to have their children convey the feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants to Chairman Mao. Sixty-something Old Lady Qiu, hearing that Wu Huazhen was going to see Chairman Mao, rushed to her house in the middle of the night, excitedly saying, "Huazhen, you are truly blessed! Tell Chairman Mao that this old woman without children is also living a happy life, and ask him to rest assured!" Junior three student Chen Shuying's grandfather, seventy-four-year-old poor peasant Chen Shiyin, had seen Chairman Mao in person during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. He had told his grandchildren many times about the joy of seeing Chairman Mao. When he learned that his granddaughter was going to visit the most beloved person, he couldn't help but shed tears of joy. He affectionately told Shuying, "Child, when you see Chairman Mao, represent this old poor peasant and shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' many times."

Over forty revolutionary teachers and students, with their boundless love for the great leader, brought the deep affection of over forty thousand people from Wenjiashi to Chairman Mao's side. Today, November 11, they finally saw the person they had been longing for day and night. Listen, their singing is so powerful and moving; their applause is so long-lasting. In their hearts, they harbor such deep class feelings for the great leader!

In the crowd, the young man who kept shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" is named Liu Jiaxi. His grandfather Liu Yiyuan and two uncles were both killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. His grandmother, who was doing women's work at the time, was also arrested and executed with her husband and son. From the time Liu Jiaxi was old enough to understand, his young heart had already planted seeds of hatred for the class enemy. Before coming to Beijing, his seventy-something grandmother told him, "The class enemy killed our relatives, and Chairman Mao led the people of the whole country to defeat the enemy, avenging this blood debt. When you go to Beijing, be sure to thank Chairman Mao!" Today, seeing Chairman Mao, how could he not be deeply moved!

Chairman Mao! The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students of Wenjiashi have so many heartfelt words to say to you, so many heartfelt songs to sing to you! But they know that even if they exhaust all the praise in the world, they still cannot express your warm care; even if they sing all the songs of praise in the world, they still cannot express your great wisdom.

What gifts can be used to express the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students' love for the great leader? Before coming to Beijing, everyone had a heated discussion. After careful consideration, they made two banners, one embroidered with "Long live Chairman Mao!" and the other with "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" They also brought photos of the site where the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops gathered, letting Chairman Mao see the changes in the places he had stayed. They also specially brought seven jin of chestnuts picked from the two chestnut trees that Chairman Mao had planted.

These two chestnut trees were planted in a place called Tielu Chong. Some of the older generation of farmers still remember some scenes of Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities there. Chairman Mao stayed in Tielu Chong for many days, often visiting the fields and farmers' homes, sometimes even working with the farmers. He understood the masses very well and cared for them the most. The chestnut trees that Chairman Mao planted with his own hands have long grown into towering trees; the revolutionary seedlings nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought here have also grown generation after generation.

Fifteen-year-old Zhang Jihua grew up near the chestnut trees that Chairman Mao planted and is an active participant in the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the entire district. He learned from Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" and always acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Last November, a classmate had a foot injury and could not go to school. He thought of Chairman Mao's teaching, "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other," and voluntarily carried this classmate to school, carrying him back and forth over ten miles for four or five days. After seeing Chairman Mao, he wrote excitedly, "I will study Mao Zedong Thought more diligently and truly do as the heroes of the 32111 drilling team do, imprinting Mao Zedong Thought in my mind, dissolving it in my blood, and implementing it in my actions."

Chairman Mao's open-top car drove eastward for a long time, but the revolutionary teachers and students of Wenjiashi still stood there, waving the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and looking eastward. A thousand words echoed in their hearts:

Dearest Chairman Mao! Thirty-nine years ago, you led the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops from our hometown to Jinggangshan, relying on rural revolutionary bases to open the path for the Chinese revolution. Today, you personally initiated and led us in carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Your line is, was, and will forever be the only correct line. We will follow you in making revolution forever, from victory to greater victories!

### 毛主席啊，文家市人民想念您！

    毛主席啊，文家市人民想念您！
    二十多里红色检阅大道上，彩旗招展，欢声雷动。千万张激动的脸，千万颗火热的心，一齐迎向我们心中最红最红的红太阳。
    当毛主席乘坐的敞篷汽车缓缓驶近民族饭店门前的时候，来自湖南浏阳县文家市的四十多名革命师生，仰望着伟大领袖慈祥的笑颜，一个个激动得热血沸腾，热泪盈眶。他们欢呼着，跳跃着，千言万语并成一句：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    文家市，是毛主席领导秋收起义部队向井冈山进军的起点。
    一九二七年，蒋介石背叛了革命，乌云笼罩着全国。在危急关头，毛主席领导了著名的秋收起义。九月间，毛主席身穿老蓝布衣服，脚踏草鞋，来到文家市，于九月二十日，集合部队讲了一次话。他以宏亮的声音，向红军战士们分析了当时的形势，指出了光明的前途，强调建立一支坚强的革命武装的重要性。他鼓励大家不要气馁，“万事起头难”，要革命，就不能怕困难。只要我们咬咬牙，把这一关挺过去，革命总有出头的一天！几天以后，毛主席亲自带领这支部队，从这里出发，经过三湾改编，十月到达井冈山，创立了我国第一个农村革命根据地，为中国革命开辟了胜利的道路。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席离开英雄的文家市，已经三十多年了。可是，这里的一砖一瓦都记录着毛主席的伟大功绩，一草一木都沐浴着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。毛主席啊毛主席，这里的革命人民每时每刻都在怀念着您！
    今年十月中旬，文家市中等学校的革命师生，要选派代表上北京看望毛主席，这喜讯迅速传遍了各个村庄。文家市的贫下中农奔走相告，欢呼跳跃，有的生产队还专门召集贫下中农开会，让自己的子弟把贫下中农的心意，带给毛主席。六十多岁的邱老大娘，听到吴华珍要去见毛主席，连夜赶到她家，激动地对她说：“华珍，你真是太幸福了！你告诉毛主席他老人家，我这个无儿无女的孤老婆子，也和大家一样，过着幸福生活，请他老人家放心！”初三学生陈淑英的祖父、七十四岁的老贫农陈世引，当年曾经见过毛主席。他不止一次地给儿孙们讲述见到毛主席时的幸福心情。当他知道孙女要去看望最敬爱的亲人，禁不住流出了喜悦的眼泪。他深情地对淑英说：“孩子，你见了毛主席，要代表我这个老贫农，多喊几声‘毛主席万岁！’”
    四十多名革命师生，怀着对伟大领袖的无比热爱，带着文家市四万多人民的深情厚意，来到了毛主席的身边。今天，十一月十一日，他们终于见到了日夜想念的亲人。听，他们的歌声，是那样宏亮激动；他们的掌声，又是那样经久不息。在他们心中，蕴藏着对伟大领袖的多么深厚的阶级感情啊！
    人群中那位不停地喊着“毛主席万岁”的青年，名叫刘家喜。他的祖父刘裔元和两个伯父，都是第二次国内革命战争时期，被国民党反动派杀害的。当时做妇联工作的祖母，也被抓去，给自己的丈夫和儿子陪斩。刘家喜从懂事的时候起，小小的心田里，就埋下了仇恨阶级敌人的种子。来京之前，七十多岁的祖母对他说：“阶级敌人杀害了亲人，毛主席领导全国人民打败了敌人，报了这血海深仇。你上北京，要好好谢谢毛主席啊！”今天，他见到了毛主席，怎能不激动万分呢！
    毛主席啊！文家市的贫下中农和革命师生，有多少知心话儿要对您说，多少贴心的歌儿要对您唱啊！可是他们知道，即使说尽了世界上所有的赞语，都说不尽您的亲切关怀；唱完了世界上所有的颂歌，也难以表达您的英明伟大。
    用什么礼物来表达贫下中农和革命师生热爱伟大领袖的心意呢？来京之前，大家进行了热烈的讨论。经过再三考虑，制做了两面锦旗，一面绣着“毛主席万岁！”一面绣着“祝福毛主席万寿无疆！”他们还捎来了秋收起义部队会师旧址的照片，让毛主席他老人家看看当年他住过的地方起了哪些变化。他们还特意捎来了毛主席亲手栽的两棵板栗树上摘下的七斤栗子。
    这两棵板栗树，栽种在一个叫铁炉冲的地方。老一辈的农民，有的还记得当年毛主席在那里从事革命活动的一些情景。毛主席在铁炉冲住过好些日子，经常到田边，到农民家里访问，有时还和农民一起劳动。他非常了解群众，也最关心群众。毛主席亲手栽培的板栗树，早已长成参天大树；毛泽东思想在这里培育的革命苗子，也一代一代地成长起来了。
    十五岁的张继华，是在毛主席栽种的板栗树附近长大的，是全专区活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子。他学了毛主席写的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》，就处处照毛主席的指示办事。去年十一月，班里有个同学脚痛不能上学，他想起毛主席“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，便主动去背这个同学上学，在来回十多里的路上，连续背了四五天。见到毛主席以后，他激动地写道：“我要更加努力学习毛泽东思想，真正做到像32111钻井队的英雄们那样，把毛泽东思想印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。”
    毛主席乘坐的敞篷汽车，向东驶去很远了，文家市的革命师生，还站在那里，摇着红色的《毛主席语录》，翘首东望。千言万语在他们心中回荡：
    最敬爱的毛主席啊！三十九年前，您从我们的家乡，带领着秋收起义部队，走上井冈山，依靠农村革命根据地，开辟了中国革命前进的道路。今天，您又亲自发动和领导我们开展了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。您的路线，过去是、现在是、将来也永远是唯一正确的路线。我们要世世代代跟着您闹革命，从胜利走向更大的胜利！
