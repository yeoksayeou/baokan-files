The Chinese Communist Party delegation, led by Kang Sheng, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, and Li Xiannian, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, visited Durres, the largest port in Albania, on the morning of the 30th. They were accompanied by Ramiz Alia, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Secretary of the Central Committee, Spiro Koleka, a member of the Political Bureau, and Adil Carcani, a member of the Central Committee. The delegation received a warm welcome from the party and government leaders of the Durres region and the entire city's population.

When the delegation's car entered the city of Durres, thousands of citizens lined the streets, enthusiastically shouting "Enver—Mao Zedong." Ramiz Malec, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the First Secretary of the Durres Regional Committee, and Ymer Reka, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Durres Regional People's Assembly, welcomed the Chinese Communist Party delegation at the entrance of the Moisiu Cultural Palace in the city center. Young Pioneers presented flowers to the guests. Malec said in his welcome speech, "The people of the entire Durres region, the Durres Regional Committee of the Party of Labour, and the Executive Committee of the Regional People's Assembly warmly welcome the Chinese Communist Party delegation to this region. Our people, like all Albanians, love the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Mao Zedong."

Kang Sheng enthusiastically praised the series of revolutionary measures taken by the Party of Labour of Albania in the political, ideological, and military fields. He said that many of the revolutionary measures taken by the Party of Labour of Albania are worth learning from.

Malec and Kang Sheng both enthusiastically praised the eternal friendship between the two parties and the peoples of China and Albania, forged by Comrade Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha.

Subsequently, the Chinese guests, accompanied by the Director of the Cultural Palace, Rezi Kriliro, visited the Cultural Palace and the ancient city ruins discovered underground during its construction in the 2nd century AD. They watched revolutionary performances by the amateur song and dance troupe.

The Chinese Communist Party delegation also visited the Sino-Albanian Friendship Port of Durres, where they were warmly welcomed by the port workers, the Chinese and Albanian staff of the Sino-Albanian Shipping Company, and the sailors on the Chinese ships docked at the port. When the delegation entered the port, the ships docked there blew their horns in salute to the guests. Fejzi Mataj, the Director of the Durres Port, who had just returned from a visit to China, briefed Kang Sheng, Li Xiannian, and other comrades on the achievements of the port workers in smashing the imperialist and revisionist blockade and completing the tasks assigned by the Party.

Before leaving Durres, all members of the Chinese Communist Party delegation climbed a small hill to the west of the city to overlook the entire city and the beautiful Adriatic Sea.

During their visits to the Moisiu Cultural Palace and the Durres Port, the Chinese Communist Party delegation presented copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the staff of both units.

Accompanying the delegation on their visit to Durres were Wang Jinchuan, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania.
