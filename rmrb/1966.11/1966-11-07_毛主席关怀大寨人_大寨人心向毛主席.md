Old Hero Jia Jincai has returned from Beijing. He brought back to the people of Daqing the great care of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

On October 13, as soon as Jia Jincai entered the village, he was surrounded by people. Everyone rushed to shake hands with Jia Jincai, asking in unison, "Is Chairman Mao in good health?"

Jia Jincai smiled and said to everyone, "Chairman Mao is very healthy! His face is radiant, and his spirit is vigorous."

Everyone heard this and was so happy they almost jumped up. Tears of joy and excitement welled up in the eyes of many people. They said, "As long as Chairman Mao is healthy, we are at ease!"

On the second evening, Jia Jincai reported to the cadres and members of Daqing Brigade about his experience in Beijing seeing Chairman Mao and participating in the National Day celebrations. He first told everyone, "Chairman Mao is in very good health!" Then, he began to talk about his feelings and experiences in Beijing.

He said, "On the morning of September 28, I arrived in our great capital, the center of the proletarian revolution—Beijing, and I was by the side of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao."

On the 29th, the escorting comrades told us that we would move to the location of the Central Committee of the Party the next day. I was stunned when I heard this. I thought, I am just an old man in my fifties who has been dealing with stones in the mountains all day, how could I go there to live? Someone standing next to me said, "This is Chairman Mao's love for us workers and peasants!" That night, I was so happy thinking about this that I couldn't sleep all night.

On the morning of the 30th, we moved into the location of the Central Committee of the Party. In the afternoon, Premier Zhou Enlai received us and spoke to us. In the evening, we attended a grand National Day reception hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai at the Great Hall of the People. I never dreamed that I, a person who has suffered generation after generation, could sit in the Great Hall of the People in the capital with Premier Zhou Enlai and other Party and state leaders, and with friends from the five continents, to have a meal. After the reception ended, Premier Zhou Enlai, who had been busy all day, personally came to see us at our residence. The Premier came to me and firmly shook my hand, asking, "Are you Jia Jincai from Daqing?" I was so happy I didn't know what to say. I said, "I am Jia Jincai." The Premier then asked, "Has Daqing suffered another disaster this year?" I told the Premier, "Not just once, we have suffered five natural disasters. Yet, we still had a bumper harvest this year. We people of Daqing follow Chairman Mao's words and rely on Mao Zedong Thought. We can do anything, overcome any disaster, and eliminate any harm!" The Premier listened and smiled, very satisfied, saying, "Daqing has developed relying on Mao Zedong Thought. Every time there is a disaster, you use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome it. In the future, you must study Chairman Mao's works even better!" The Premier was very affectionate when he met with us, like family. That night, I didn't close my eyes all night.

On October 1, the happy moment I had been longing for finally arrived. In the morning, I and the other representatives participating in the National Day celebrations ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum together. At 10 o'clock, Chairman Mao, radiant and spirited, smiled and walked towards us, waving. As soon as I saw our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, my heart was so excited it almost jumped out of my chest. I kept shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Tears of joy streamed down my face. Even if I shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" a thousand times or ten thousand times, it would not be enough to express my boundless love and gratitude for Chairman Mao! What made me even happier was that Chairman Mao was so healthy and spirited. This is the greatest happiness for the poor and lower-middle peasants of Daqing and all the people of China, and it is the greatest happiness for the oppressed people of the world. In the old society, landlords stepped on us poor and lower-middle peasants like we were grass. In New China, Chairman Mao treats us poor and lower-middle peasants like a treasure, discussing state affairs with us. Heaven and earth are great, but not as great as Chairman Mao's kindness; parents are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao...

Before Jia Jincai could finish speaking, the entire audience erupted in applause. Some people jumped up, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!"

Jia Jincai finally expressed his determination: to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, daring to brave knife mountains and fire seas, and remaining steadfast through droughts and floods.

Jia Jincai's report stirred a strong response among the members of Daqing. They said, Daqing has had three major happy events in recent years: in 1964, Chairman Mao inquired about the people of Daqing and Jia Jincai when he met with Chen Yonggui, the secretary of the Daqing Brigade Party Committee; in 1965, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Daqing, praising the self-reliant revolutionary spirit of the people of Daqing, and encouraging us to be humble and press forward; now, Chairman Mao has received old hero Jia Jincai when he met with advanced figures from various fronts across the country in Beijing.

The "Iron Shoulders" of Daqing, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee Liang Bianliang, said excitedly, "I never dreamed that we, ordinary farmers, could go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's heart is connected with ours, the poor and lower-middle peasants. I will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, advancing through storms and waves."

The chairwoman of the Women's Federation of Daqing and Jia Jincai's wife, Song Liying, said, "An old man who breaks stones in the mountains goes to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. This is a great happy event that our ancestors never even dreamed of! Everyone says the sun is warm, but I say it is not as warm as Mao Zedong Thought; everyone says mothers are dear, but I say the Party is even dearer. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! I will make my descendants remember you forever, generation after generation following you!"

The "Iron Girl" of Daqing, Secretary of the Youth League Branch Guo Fenglian, said, "Chairman Mao values us poor and lower-middle peasants the most, cares for us the most, and protects us the most. He is our dearest person. The people of Daqing listen to his words, people change, mountains change, land changes. The people of Daqing read his books, old Daqing becomes new Daqing. Chairman Mao's books are the most precious treasure, the lifeblood of revolutionary people. We will read them for a thousand years, ten thousand years, generation after generation. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, opposes Mao Zedong Thought, is our enemy, and we will overthrow him!"

Seventy-three-year-old poor peasant community member Jia Genyuan has always had deep feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. After hearing Jia Jincai's report, he was so happy he couldn't close his mouth, telling everyone, "Chairman Mao loves us poor and lower-middle peasants more than his own children. In the old society, I worked as a long-term laborer for landlords for over twenty years, eating husks and vegetables all year round, enduring scoldings and cold. It was Chairman Mao who saved me from the fire pit and gave me a good life. Parents are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao! Everything is good because Chairman Mao leads us well. Chairman Mao's books are books for revolution. I will study them until I am old, forever following Chairman Mao forward." This old man, after hearing Jia Jincai's report, seemed to have rejuvenated by several decades. Now, he picks up over a hundred pounds of manure for the team every day. He says, picking manure and fertilizing is also for the revolution.

Fifty-eight-year-old poor peasant woman community member Han Heini's husband worked in a coal mine for a capitalist in the old society and was tortured to death. Chairman Mao came, and this poor old woman finally stood up. She loves the new society and the great leader Chairman Mao. She bought five portraits of Chairman Mao and hung them on the walls of her new cave dwelling. She said, "Every time I look up, I can see Chairman Mao. Seeing him, I know that sweetness comes from Chairman Mao. Even if I die, I will make my descendants never forget Chairman Mao's kindness!" After hearing Jia Jincai's report, her heart bloomed with joy. She said, "Chairman Mao's kindness to us poor and lower-middle peasants is endless, even if we use the sky as paper and the sea as ink, we cannot write it all down! Those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who want to oppose Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Party, we poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree! I will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, generation after generation!"

Chairman Mao's great care and Premier Zhou Enlai's warm greetings have greatly inspired the people of Daqing. They enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, determined to make Daqing a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. They raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, rolled up their sleeves, and sped up production and construction, determined to build Daqing even more beautifully. After returning from Chairman Mao's side, Jia Jincai felt full of energy. He said, "Chairman Mao values us so much, is so close to us, even if we risk our lives, follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, we cannot repay his kindness!" Now, he has returned to the stone pit of Jinshipo, swinging his iron hammer weighing over thirty pounds to break stones. To build terraces and build new cave dwellings, he and his comrades break more than thirty loads of stones every day compared to before. The "Iron Girls" wield their shiny sickles, and in a few days, they have harvested all the millet in the entire brigade. The "Iron Shoulders" wrote Chairman Mao's instructions on their carrying poles: "Resolutely, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They carried the golden millet load by load along the winding mountain roads to the threshing ground. A group of experts in building stone dams are reinforcing the stone dam and improving the land in Langwopai, striving for an even greater harvest next year.

The heroes of Daqing, Jia Jincai, and his comrades, their hearts all turn towards Beijing, towards our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao! They sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life!

The people of Daqing, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have overcome one disaster after another, becoming a model for Chinese farmers to build a new socialist countryside through self-reliance. This is them studying Chairman Mao's works. (Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter)

### 毛主席关怀大寨人  大寨人心向毛主席

    毛主席关怀大寨人  大寨人心向毛主席
    老英雄贾进才从北京回来了。他给大寨人带来了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的巨大关怀。
    十月十三日，贾进才刚进村，就被人们围起来。大家抢着跟贾进才握手，异口同声地问：“毛主席他老人家身体可好！”
    贾进才笑着对大伙说：“毛主席身体可壮实哩！红光满面，神采焕发。”
    大伙听了，高兴得几乎要跳起来。幸福和激动的热泪，在许多人的笑脸上夺眶而出。他们说：“毛主席身体好，我们就放心了！”
    第二天晚上，贾进才向大寨大队的干部、社员们报告了他在北京见到毛主席和参加国庆观礼的情况。他先告诉大家：“毛主席他老人家身体很健康！”然后，才讲起他去北京观礼的种种感受。
    他说，九月二十八日早上，我到了我们伟大祖国的首都、无产阶级革命的中心——北京，到了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的身边。
    二十九日那天，带队的同志对我们说，明天要搬到党中央机关所在地去住。我一听，愣住了。我想，我这个整天在山沟里和石头打交道的五十多岁的老头子，还能到那里去住呀！站在我一旁的人说：“这是毛主席热爱咱工农兵嘛！”那天晚上，我想着这桩事，高兴得一夜没有睡着觉。
    三十日上午，我们搬进了党中央机关所在地。下午，周总理接见了我们，向我们讲了话。晚上，我们在人民大会堂，参加了周总理举行的盛大国庆招待会。我真是连作梦也没有想到，我这个世世代代的受苦人，能同周总理等党和国家领导人，同五大洲的朋友们一道，坐在首都的人民大会堂里吃饭。招待会结束以后，周总理忙了一天，又亲自到我们住的地方看我们。总理走到我跟前，紧紧地握住我的手，问我：“你就是大寨的贾进才吗？”我高兴得不知说啥才好。我说：“我就是贾进才。”总理又问我：“大寨今年又遭了一次灾害吗？”我对总理说：“不止一次，是遭了五次天灾。就这样，我们今年还是大丰收。我们大寨人听毛主席的话，靠毛泽东思想，啥事都能办，啥灾都能抗，啥害都能除！”总理听了笑着，非常满意地说：“你们大寨就是靠毛泽东思想发展起来的。每次遭灾，都用毛泽东思想把它制服了。以后，你们更要好好学习毛主席著作呀！”总理同我们见面时，像亲人一样，非常亲热。这一晚，我又通宵没有合眼。
    十月一日，我昼思夜盼的幸福时刻，终于来到了。早上，我和参加国庆观礼的其他代表一起，登上了天安门城楼。十点钟，毛主席红光满面，神采奕奕，微笑着向我们走来，向我们招手。我一看见我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，心激动得快要跳出来了。我一个劲地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”眼里的热泪扑簌扑簌地直往下掉。真是喊一千声一万句毛主席万岁，也表达不尽我对毛主席无限热爱无限感激的心情啊！更使我高兴的是，毛主席他老人家那样健康，那样精神。这是咱大寨贫下中农和全中国人民的最大幸福，是全世界被压迫人民的最大幸福。在旧社会，地主把咱贫下中农踩在脚底下，不当一根草。在新中国，毛主席把咱贫下中农当作一块宝，和咱们一起商量国家大事。天大地大，没有毛主席的恩情大；爹亲娘亲，没有毛主席亲，……
    没等贾进才把话说完，全场掌声雷动。有的人跳起来，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    贾进才最后表示：要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，刀山火海也敢闯，海枯石烂不变心。
    贾进才的这个报告，在大寨社员中引起了强烈的反响。他们说，大寨这几年有三件大喜事：一九六四年，毛主席在接见大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵时，问候大寨人民，问候贾进才；一九六五年，周总理视察大寨时，赞扬大寨人民自力更生的革命精神，勉励咱们戒骄戒躁，继续前进；如今，毛主席在北京接见全国各条战线上先进人物的时候，又接见了老英雄贾进才。
    大寨的“铁肩膀”、党支部副书记梁便良激动地说：“我作梦也没想到，咱这些庄稼人，还能到北京去见毛主席。毛主席和咱贫下中农心连心，我要永远跟着毛主席闹革命，在大风大浪中向前进。”
    大寨妇代会主任、贾进才的爱人宋立英说：“一个在山沟里打石头的老头子，到北京见了毛主席，这真是咱老几辈想也没有想到的大喜事啊！人人都说太阳暖，我说它比不上毛泽东思想暖；人人都说母亲亲，我说党比母亲更加亲。毛主席啊毛主席！我要叫俺儿孙万代都记住您，世世代代跟着您！”
    大寨的“铁姑娘”、团支部书记郭凤莲说：“毛主席最看得起咱贫下中农，最关心咱，最爱护咱，是咱的贴心人。大寨人听了他老人家的话，人变，山变，土地变。大寨人读了他老人家的书，旧大寨变成新大寨。毛主席的书是宝中宝，是革命人民的命根子，我们要读它一千年、一万年，世世代代都要读。谁要是反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，谁就是我们的敌人，我们就要打倒他！”
    七十三岁的贫农社员贾根元，对伟大领袖毛主席一直怀着无比深厚的感情。他听了贾进才的报告，喜得整天合不上嘴，逢人便说：“毛主席爱咱贫下中农，胜过爱自己的亲生儿女。我在旧社会，给地主扛了二十多年长工，一年到头吃糠咽菜，挨骂受冻。是毛主席把我从火坑中救了出来，过上了好生活。爹亲娘亲，哪有毛主席对俺亲！千好万好，都因为毛主席他老人家领导得好。毛主席的书是闹革命的书，我要活到老，学到老，永远跟着毛主席向前走。”这位老人听了贾进才的报告，好像年轻了几十岁。现在，他每天都要给队里拾上百斤的粪。他说，拾粪积肥，也是为了革命。
    五十八岁的贫农女社员韩黑妮，她的丈夫在旧社会给资本家下煤窑，被折磨死了。毛主席来了，这位贫农老大娘才翻了身。她热爱新社会，热爱伟大的领袖毛主席。她买了五张毛主席像，挂在她住的新石窑洞的墙壁上。她说：“我一抬头，就能看到毛主席。看到他老人家，我就知道，甜是从毛主席那里来的。我就是死了，也叫我的后代永远不忘毛主席的恩情啊！”她听了贾进才的报告，心里乐开了花。她说：“毛主席对咱贫下中农的恩情，就是把蓝天当纸，海水当墨，也写不完啊！那些地、富、反、坏、右分子，想要反对毛主席、反对党中央，我们贫下中农一万个不答应！我要永远跟着毛主席闹革命，子子孙孙不变心！”
    毛主席的巨大关怀，周总理的亲切问候，给大寨人民以极大的鼓舞。他们热烈地响应林彪同志的号召，掀起了一个新的活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，决心要把大寨办成毛泽东思想的大学校。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，鼓足干劲，加紧生产建设，要把大寨建设得更美好。贾进才从毛主席的身边回来以后，觉得浑身上下都是劲。他说：“毛主席这样瞧得起咱，对咱这样亲，咱就是豁出老命，跟毛主席干一辈子革命，也报答不完他老人家的恩情！”现在，他又进了金石坡的石窝里，抡起他那三十多斤重的铁榔头打石头了。为着修梯田和砌新的窑洞，他和他的战友们每天打出的石头，比以前增加了三十多抬。“铁姑娘”们挥动银光闪闪的镰刀，没有几天工夫，就把全大队的谷子收割完了。“铁肩膀”们在扁担上写上毛主席的指示：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们沿着蜿蜒曲折的盘山道，把金黄色的谷子一担担地运到了打谷场上。一伙修筑石坝的能手，正在狼窝掌里加固石坝，整修土地，为夺取明年更大的丰收而努力。
    大寨的英雄们，贾进才和他的战友们，颗颗红心朝向北京，朝向最最敬爱的领袖毛主席！他们衷心地祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！
