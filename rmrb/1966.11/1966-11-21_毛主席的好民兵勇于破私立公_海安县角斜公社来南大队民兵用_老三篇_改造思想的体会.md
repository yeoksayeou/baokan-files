Editor's Note: Every militiaman has many tasks to accomplish, but the most important task is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Once armed with Mao Zedong Thought, militiamen can accomplish all their tasks. The militiamen of Lainan Brigade, Jiao Xie People's Commune in Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province, have grasped this point. The brigade's study sessions on Chairman Mao's works are well-organized. The following are a few accounts of how militiamen have applied "Three Articles" to transform their worldviews, which are instructive to everyone.

Militiamen have the glorious mission of building and defending our motherland. To accomplish these missions, they must first study and apply Chairman Mao's works, earnestly transform their thoughts, break away from bourgeois "self-interest," establish proletarian "public spirit," and train themselves to become Chairman Mao's good militiamen.

Whether a matter is big or small, one should not just look at the surface but examine the root cause. Some shortcomings and errors, though seemingly small, have deep roots. If one considers them as "trivial matters" and relaxes the struggle in one's mind, the "self" will run rampant.

In January this year, the community elected me as the work points recorder. After working for a month, when I settled the work points account, I found that I had fewer points than community members of equal labor capacity. My mind immediately started calculating: I am not shorter than others, and my strength is not less than others, so why do I have fewer work points? After thinking it over, I concluded that this was because of the disadvantage of being a work points recorder. When this thought emerged, I also recalled Chairman Mao's teaching: "Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and dedication is manifested in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." However, I did not examine myself according to Chairman Mao's instructions but instead thought: although my thoughts are wrong, they have not affected my work and are not a big problem. By forgiving myself in this way, the problem developed, and the knots in my mind became tighter. Later, I did not record work points seriously and even requested the leadership to "find someone else," causing some damage to the work.

My erroneous thoughts developed so seriously mainly because I forgave the "trivial matter." The thought of being disadvantaged as a work points recorder has its root in "self." This root is deep. I treated such a big problem as a trivial matter and let it pass, resulting in the "self" worm boring a big hole in my mind. Learning from this experience, under the guidance of the leadership and comrades, I re-studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People." This time, with my own problems in mind, I used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a fierce attack on "self," significantly raising my ideological level.

This incident made me realize that one should examine problems from the root. As long as the root is "self," one must fight it fiercely and never forgive it. Forgiving it is actually indulging and encouraging it. In the end, "self" will flood the mind. "Self" is the complete and thorough enemy. Only by completely and thoroughly defeating "self" can one completely and thoroughly serve the people.

To fight "self," one must fight fiercely, dare to confront and struggle, not fear pain, and not put on a show.

This spring, the commune dug a river that happened to pass through our production team, dividing our team into east and west parts. The west side has more people but less land, while the east side has fewer people but more land. People from the west side going to the east side have to travel farther and take a ferry, which is time-consuming and troublesome. The team leadership asked me to take the lead in going to the east side to work. I was unhappy about this. The leadership discovered my active thoughts and encouraged me to consult Chairman Mao's works. In the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao criticizes those who "in the face of a matter, first think of themselves and then think of others," saying, "they are actually not Communists, at least not pure Communists." I read this passage and felt that I had the problem of "first thinking of myself." However, I did go to the east side, which shows that I also "thought of others"; thinking this way was like scratching an itch through clothes, not even touching the surface of "self." In fact, although I went to the east side, my thoughts were still in the west. Once, while planting cotton in the east side, a sudden thunderstorm caught me off guard, and I got soaked. "Self" took the opportunity to emerge again. I thought, if I hadn't taken the lead, I wouldn't have been caught in the rain! This way, "self" gained the upper hand, and I became even lazier about going to the east side. Just as my thoughts were drifting further away, the leadership and comrades helped me study "Serve the People" with my problems in mind, guiding me to launch an attack on "self." I thought, I didn't want to go to the east side, and even when I went, I didn't work hard, first thinking of myself and then still thinking of myself, how far am I from being "complete" and "thorough"? This time, I fought fiercely with "self" and achieved victory. After that, I no longer cared whether I worked in the east or west.

Through this repeated struggle, I gained an insight: "self" can sneak into the mind unnoticed, but it cannot sneak out unnoticed. To defeat "self," one must be resolute, use great strength, be ruthless, fear no pain, and show no weakness. In battle, one must dare to fight; in the struggle against "self," one must have the same spirit.

How to deal with selfish thoughts? Should one change them secretly or fight them openly? Regarding this question, I had to go through a process to understand it clearly.

I have been a platoon leader for six years. Some who were originally in my platoon are now my leaders, which gave me a great shock. I doubted that the leadership did not trust me and worried that the militiamen looked down on me. Later, I got stuck in a corner, thinking it would be simpler not to be a platoon leader, avoiding these troubles. Later, I studied "Serve the People" and realized that this thought did not meet the requirement of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and it was "self" playing tricks. However, I was afraid that others would laugh at me for having backward thoughts, so I wanted to change secretly.

Can one change secretly? Once, during a militiamen's activity, a militiaman retorted at me, and my thought of "it would be simpler not to be a platoon leader" resurfaced. Secretly changing did not work, so I studied "Serve the People" again. Chairman Mao said: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings." I was afraid to reveal my thoughts because I was afraid of being laughed at. Fighting "self" with selfish thoughts, how can one defeat "self"? Chairman Mao's instructions gave me courage. In a militiamen's meeting, I revealed my thoughts and asked everyone to criticize me. Everyone saw my sincere attitude and enthusiastically helped me analyze and fight against "self," helping me clean up the dust in my mind thoroughly.

Whether one dares to fight "self" openly or not ultimately depends on whether one has the resolve for self-revolution. Transforming thoughts requires fearing neither ugliness nor pain. Not daring to reveal one's thoughts is fearing ugliness. Fear of ugliness necessarily leads to fear of pain. Fear of ugliness and pain means one cannot defeat "self." Only by revealing one's thoughts, fighting oneself, and letting everyone help, can one clean up the dust in the mind. In other words, revealing thoughts makes thoughts bright.

The militiamen of Jiao Xie People's Commune in Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province, regard studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as the top priority in militiamen training. This is an old militiaman and production team leader, Xu Zhenglong, explaining Chairman Mao's quotations to militiamen and community members in the field.

    毛主席的好民兵勇于破私立公
    海安县角斜公社来南大队民兵用“老三篇”改造思想的体会
    不能光看苗子，要看根子
    基干民兵　吴志友
    编者按：每个民兵有许多事要做，但是，头等重要的大事，是活学活用毛主席著作。用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，民兵的一切任务都能够带动起来。
    江苏省海安县角斜公社来南大队的民兵把这一条抓住了。这个大队组织的民兵学习毛主席著作讲用会开得好。这里选登的几篇活学活用“老三篇”在改造世界观上狠下功夫的体会，对我们每个人都有教育意义。
    民兵同志们负有建设祖国、保卫祖国的光荣任务，要完成这些任务，就得首先活学活用毛主席著作，认真改造自己的思想，破资产阶级的“私”字，立无产阶级的“公”字，把自己锻炼成为一个毛主席的好民兵。
    事情是大是小，不能光看苗子，要看根子。有的缺点、错误，苗子虽小，但根子很大。如果认为是
  “小事”，放松思想斗争，“我”字就会在头脑里自由泛滥。
    今年一月间，社员选我当记工员。干了一个月，一结算工分账目，我比同等劳力的社员少了几分工，我脑子里马上盘算起来：我个子不比别人矮，力气不比别人小，工分为什么比别人少了呢？想来想去，认为这是吃了当记工员的亏。在这种想法露头的时候，我也曾想到过毛主席的教导：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”可是，我没有按照毛主席的指示来检查自己，反而认为：自己这种想法虽然不对，但没有影响工作，算不了什么大问题。这样原谅自己，问题就发展了，思想上的疙瘩越结越实。到后来，工分也不认真记了，还要求领导“另请高明”，给工作带来了一些损失。
    我的错误思想发展得这样严重，主要是吃了原谅“小事”的亏。当记工员吃亏的想法，根子是“我”字。这个根子很大。对于这样一个大问题，我却把它当作小事放过去了，结果叫“我”字这个大蛀虫，在脑子里钻了个大洞。吃一堑，长一智。在领导和同志们的帮助下，我重新学习了《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》。这次带着自己的问题，采取牵藤抓根的方法，以毛泽东思想为武器，向“我”字猛烈开火，使自己的思想大大提高了一步。
    这件事情使我认识到，看问题要从根子上看。只要根子是“我”字，就要狠斗，千万原谅不得。原谅它，实际上就是纵容它，鼓励它，到后来，“我”字必定在脑子里泛滥成灾。“我”字是“完全”“彻底”的死对头，只有完全、彻底地斗倒“我”字，才能做到完全、彻底地为人民服务。
    要敢打敢拚，不要耍花架子
    民兵排政治干事　吴志秀
    同“我”字斗，要斗得狠，就是要敢打敢拚，不要怕痛，不要耍花架子。
    今年春天，公社开了一条河，正好从我们生产队通过，把我们队劈成东西两半。河西人多地少，河东人少地多。河西的人到河东去，多跑路，还要乘渡船，既费时，又麻烦。队委会要我带头到河东去干活，我心里不高兴。领导上发现我有这个活思想，启发我向毛主席著作请教。在《纪念白求恩》一文中，毛主席批评那些“一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算”的人，“其实不是共产党员，至少不能算一个纯粹的共产党员。”我读了这一段，觉得我有“先替自己打算”的问题，但是我到底到河东去了，这说明我也“替别人打算”了；这样一想，就像隔着衣服搔痒一样，连“我”字的皮毛都没有触及到。其实，人到河东去了，思想还在河西。有一次在河东种棉花，突然下起雷阵雨，没来得及回家，浑身淋透了，“我”字又乘机钻了出来。心想，不叫我带这个头，哪会遭雨淋！这样一来，“我”字占了上风，更懒得到河东去了。正当我的思想越岔越远的时候，领导和同志们帮助我带着问题学习《为人民服务》，引导我向“我”字开火。我想，我不愿到河东去，去了又不出力干，先替自己打算，然后还是替自己打算，离“完全”“彻底”相差多远啊！这次，我同“我”字狠狠地斗了，并且取得了胜利。以后，我再也不计较是到河东还是到河西干活了。
    经过这样一个反复，我得出一条体会：“我”字可以不知不觉地钻进脑子里来，但它决不可能不知不觉地从脑子里溜走。要把“我”字斗倒，要下狠心，用大力，不留情，不怕痛，耍不得半点花架子。打仗，要敢打敢拚，同“我”字斗，打思想仗，也要有这种精神。
    敢于亮思想，才能思想亮
    民兵排长　张志锁
    有了私心怎么办？是自己悄悄改呢，还是公开斗？对于这个问题，我是经过一个反复才认识清楚的。
    我当排长六年了，有的原来是我排里的民兵，现在当起我的领导来了，这对我刺激很大。我怀疑领导不信任我了，顾虑民兵看不起我了。后来钻进了牛角尖，认为不当排长倒干脆，省得有这些烦恼。以后我学习《为人民服务》，察觉到这个思想不符合“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务的要求，是“我”字作怪。可是，我又怕说出来别人笑话我思想落后，便想悄悄地改。
    悄悄地改能改掉吗？有一次搞民兵活动，有个民兵顶了我两句，我的那种“不当排长倒干脆”的思想就又抬起头来。悄悄改行不通，我又学习《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”我不敢亮思想，就是怕人笑话。带着私心斗“我”字，怎能把“我”字斗倒呢？毛主席的指示，给了我勇气，在一次民兵会议上，我把自己的思想亮了出来，请大家批评。大家看我态度诚恳，热情帮助我分析，帮助我同“我”字斗，使我痛痛快快地打扫了一次思想上的灰尘。
    敢不敢公开同“我”字斗，归根到底是有没有自我革命的决心的问题。改造思想要一不怕丑，二不怕痛。不敢亮思想，就是怕丑。怕丑必然怕痛。怕丑怕痛，就不能斗倒“我”字。只有把思想亮出来，自己斗，让大家帮助斗，才能把脑子里的灰尘打扫干净。这也就是说，亮思想，才能思想亮。（附图片）
    江苏省海安县角斜公社的民兵们，把活学活用毛主席著作，当作民兵训练的头等大事。这是老民兵、生产队长徐正龙在田头给民兵和社员讲解毛主席语录。
