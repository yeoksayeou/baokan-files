The current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent. The basic characteristic of this excellent situation is that the masses have truly been mobilized. As Chairman Mao said, "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological transformation of the people of the whole country."

The broad masses of revolutionary people have a deeper understanding of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Their direction of struggle is clearer, and their fighting spirit is more ardent. In their struggle, they study Chairman Mao's works actively and practically, pushing the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new high. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing more deeply, more broadly, and more healthily.

Recently, the broad masses have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "care about state affairs" and have seriously considered the struggle between the two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have launched a mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line. This mass criticism has spread throughout the country, in all provinces, cities, departments, and schools. All errors that go against Chairman Mao's line and all manifestations of the bourgeois reactionary line have been exposed and criticized by the broad masses.

The broad masses rising up to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line is an important manifestation of the broad masses being truly mobilized and of the current excellent situation. This shows that the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is increasingly winning the hearts of the people, and the bourgeois reactionary line is declared bankrupt.

Chairman Mao's correct line is directly grasped by the masses, and the mass criticism of the wrong line is widely and deeply carried out. The hundreds of millions of people caring about state affairs in this way is a great thing. This is a great impetus for those comrades who do not understand, are not serious about, and are ineffective in leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is also a great help for those comrades who execute the bourgeois line to correct their mistakes. This is an important guarantee for further correcting the wrong line, eliminating its pernicious influence, correctly implementing the proletarian revolutionary line, and correctly implementing the "Sixteen Points" of the Cultural Revolution.

The struggle between the two lines has always revolved around the issue of what attitude to take towards the masses. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao believes in the masses, relies on the masses, respects the masses' spirit of initiative, and lets the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves. It mobilizes the masses to struggle against the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to struggle against all the ghosts and monsters in society, carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation. The bourgeois reactionary line, however, does the opposite. Those who propose this line oppose the masses educating themselves and liberating themselves. They bring out the Kuomintang's "tutelage" to deal with the masses, treating the masses as Liu Bei and themselves as Zhuge Liang. They suppress the masses and stifle the masses' spirit of initiative. They shift the target of struggle, directing the spearhead at the revolutionary masses, labeling revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-Party elements," "rightists," "fake leftists, real rightists," and so on.

These two lines are diametrically opposed. One is Chairman Mao's mass line, and the other is the bourgeois line of opposing and suppressing the masses. One is the line of the proletarian revolution, the line of carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and the other is the bourgeois line of opposing the revolution, the line of leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution down the opposite path, making the Cultural Revolution aborted.

Without destruction, there can be no construction. Without opposing the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminating the influence of this wrong line, it is not possible to correctly implement the proletarian revolutionary line.

Eliminating the pernicious influence of the bourgeois reactionary line requires a lot of work. The bourgeois reactionary line has its social base. This social base is mainly the bourgeoisie. This wrong line has a certain market within the Party because there is a handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These few people regard the wrong line as their talisman; because within the Party there are still quite a number of people whose worldview has not been transformed or has not been thoroughly transformed, these comrades need a process to return to the correct line from the wrong line.

For those who have made line errors, distinctions should be made. Those who proposed the wrong line (only one or two or a few people) should be distinguished from those who executed it, those who consciously executed it (this is a minority) should be distinguished from those who unconsciously executed it (this is the majority), the degree of executing the wrong line should be distinguished, and those who insist on the error should be distinguished from those who are willing to correct it and actually correct the error.

Generally speaking, comrades who have made line errors, their contradictions with the Party and the masses are still contradictions within the people. As long as they can correct their errors and return to the correct position, executing the Party's correct line, they can not only become second- or third-class cadres but also have the possibility of becoming first-class cadres. However, it must be shouted at these comrades: no matter who, no matter how great their past merits, if they insist on the wrong line, the nature of their contradictions with the Party and the masses will change, and they will slide onto the path of anti-Party and anti-socialism.

The mark of distinguishing between correcting errors and insisting on errors is the attitude towards the masses, whether or not to publicly admit to the masses that the wrong line was executed, whether or not to seriously rectify the cases of revolutionary masses who were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-Party elements," "rightists," "fake leftists, real rightists," and restore their reputations, and support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary masses.

A communist who has made a line error should have the courage to admit the error, criticize the error, and stand with the masses to criticize his own error. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?"

In the criticism of the wrong line, for comrades who have made line errors, we should follow Chairman Mao's consistent advocacy of the policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the person," "to achieve the two goals of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades." Revolutionary masses and revolutionary youth who actively rise up to criticize the wrong line should pay attention to Chairman Mao's teachings. As for some masses who are temporarily deceived by the wrong line, they should not be blamed, nor should they be labeled with hats like "royalist," but should be patiently helped and united with.

Comrades who have made line errors should sincerely and wholeheartedly listen to the masses' criticisms, as Chairman Mao often teaches, "put down your airs and be a good student." They should stand with the revolutionary masses and together eliminate the pernicious influence caused by the bourgeois reactionary line. For certain over-the-top language and actions in the masses' criticism, they should not have any antagonistic sentiment, should see that their general direction is correct, should understand their feelings, should believe in the majority of the masses, and believe that the masses are reasonable.

Comrades who have made errors should get rid of many "fears" in their minds. These "fears" ultimately amount to fearing the masses and fearing the revolution. They should follow Chairman Mao's instructions, change "fear" to "dare," change "I" to "public," and change "believing in oneself" to "believing in the masses." Only in this way can they correct their errors, turn passive into active, and lead the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution according to Chairman Mao's line.

All comrades who want revolution, let us unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, on the basis of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forward.

    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利
    《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十四期社论
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命是一片大好形势。形势大好的基本特点是：广大群众真正发动起来了。正如毛主席所说，“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”
    广大革命群众对于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线更加了解。他们的斗争方向更加明确，斗志更加昂扬。他们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动推向了新的高潮。无产阶级文化大革命运动，正在更深入、更广阔、更健康地向前发展。
    近来，广大群众响应毛主席“要关心国家大事”的号召，认真思考无产阶级文化大革命中两条路线的斗争，对资产阶级反动路线展开了群众性的批判。这种群众性的批判遍及全国各省市，各部门，各学校。一切违背毛主席路线的错误，资产阶级反动路线的各种表现形式，都遭到广大群众的揭露和批判。
    广大革命群众起来批判资产阶级反动路线，这是广大群众真正发动起来和当前形势大好的重要表现。这说明了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线日益深入人心，资产阶级反动路线宣告破产。
    毛主席的正确路线直接为群众所掌握，广泛深入地开展群众性的对错误路线的批判，亿万群众这样地关心国家大事，是一件极大的好事。这对于那些领导无产阶级文化大革命很不理解、很不认真、很不得力的同志，是一个很大的推动力，对于那些执行资产阶级路线的同志改正错误，也是一个很大的帮助。这对于进一步纠正错误路线，清除它的恶劣影响，正确贯彻执行无产阶级革命路线，正确贯彻执行文化大革命的十六条，是一个最重要的保证。
    两条路线的斗争，一直围绕着对待群众采取什么立场，采取什么态度的问题上。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，是相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，放手发动群众去斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，放手让群众斗争社会上的一切牛鬼蛇神，进行斗、批、改。资产阶级反动路线却反其道而行之。提出这条路线的某些代表人，反对群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，他们搬出国民党的“训政”来对待群众，把群众当成阿斗，把自己当成诸葛亮，他们压制群众，扼杀群众的首创精神，他们转移斗争目标，把矛头指向革命群众，把革命群众打成“反革命”、“反党分子”、“右派分子”、“假左派，真右派”等等。
    这两条路线是针锋相对的。一条是毛主席的群众路线，另一条是资产阶级的反对群众、镇压群众的路线。一条是无产阶级革命的路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的路线，另一条是资产阶级反对革命的路线，要把无产阶级文化大革命引到相反的道路，使文化大革命夭折的路线。
    不破不立。不反对资产阶级反动路线，不清除这条错误路线的影响，就不能正确贯彻执行无产阶级的革命路线。
    清除资产阶级反动路线的恶劣影响，需要做很多工作。资产阶级反动路线有它的社会基础。这个社会基础主要是资产阶级。这条错误路线在党内有一定的市场，因为党内有一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这一小撮人把错误路线当作他们的护身符；因为党内还有相当一批世界观没有改造和没有改造好的糊涂人，这些同志从错误路线回到正确路线上来是需要一个过程的。
    对于犯路线错误的人，应当加以区分。应当把提出错误路线的（只不过是一两个或几个人）和执行错误路线的区别开来，把自觉执行的（这是少数的）和不自觉执行的（这是大量的）区别开来，把执行错误路线的轻重程度区别开来，把坚持错误的和愿意改正并且实行改正错误的区别开来。
    一般说来，犯了路线错误的同志，他们同党同群众的矛盾，还是人民内部的矛盾。只要他们能够改正错误，回到正确立场上来，执行党的正确路线，那就不仅可能是二类干部、三类干部，也还可能发展成为一类干部。但是，必须向这些同志大喝一声：无论什么人，无论过去有多大功绩，如果坚持错误路线，他们同党同群众的矛盾的性质就会起变化，就会从非对抗性矛盾变成为对抗性矛盾，他们就会滑到反党反社会主义的道路上去。
    区别改正错误或坚持错误的标志，是对群众的态度，是否公开向群众承认执行了错误路线，是否给被打成“反革命”、“反党分子”、“右派分子”、“假左派，真右派”的革命群众，认真平反，公开给他们恢复名誉，并且支持革命群众的革命行动。
    一个共产主义者，犯了路线错误，应当有勇气承认错误，检讨错误，同群众站在一道批判自己的错误。毛主席教导我们：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”
    在批判错误路线当中，对于犯了路线错误的同志，要本着毛主席一贯主张的“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针，“达到既要弄清思想又要团结同志这样两个目的”。起来积极进行批判错误路线的革命群众，革命的青少年，都要注意毛主席的这个教导。至于一时受错误路线蒙蔽的某些群众，则不应该责怪他们，也不要给他们扣“保皇派”之类的帽子，而应该耐心地帮助他们，团结他们。
    犯了路线错误的同志，应当虚心地诚恳地全心全意听取群众的批评，像毛主席经常教导的那样，“放下臭架子、甘当小学生”。应当同革命群众站到一起，共同清除资产阶级反动路线造成的恶劣影响。对于群众批判中某些过头的语言和做法，不应当产生任何对抗的情绪，应当看到他们的大方向是正确的，应当理解他们的心情，应当相信群众的大多数，相信群众是通情达理的。
    犯错误的同志，要去掉脑子里的许多“怕”字。这些“怕”字，归根到底，就是怕群众，怕革命。应当根据毛主席的指示，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“我”字换成“公”字，把“相信自己”换成“相信群众”。这样，才能纠正错误，变被动为主动，按照毛主席的路线，把无产阶级文化大革命领导起来。
    一切愿意革命的同志，让我们在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的基础上，团结起来，把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进。
