	The bugle blows, the battle flags dance,
	Facing the morning sun, we read the precious book.
	Soldiers are all sunflowers,
	Chairman Mao's quotations shine in our hearts!

	Facing the morning sun, we read the precious book,
	Every word is like an axe that splits mountains;
	It shatters all difficulties and perils,
	And sweeps away all obstacles!

	Facing the morning sun, we read the precious book,
	Every line is like a pillar that holds up the sky;
	No matter how fierce the evil winds and poisonous mists,
	The red light shines for ten thousand miles on our path!

	Facing the morning sun, we read the precious book,
	Every page is like a drum that marches forward;
	Thousands and thousands of soldiers charge ahead,
	Forge a revolutionary path!

	Facing the morning sun, we read the precious book,
	The winds and clouds of the five continents rush before our eyes;
	The Earth revolves in our hearts,
	We paint a grand picture of world revolution!

	Facing the morning sun, we read the precious book,
	The more we read, the more strength we gain;
	Forever following Chairman Mao,
	We raise the red flag and stride forward!

    毛主席语录照心头
    解放军某部　姚成友　钟永华　黄计钧
    军号吹，战旗舞，
    迎着朝阳读宝书。
    战士都是向阳花，
    毛主席语录照心头！
    迎着朝阳读宝书，
    字字都是开山斧；
    劈碎千难和万险，
    横扫一切拦路虎！
    迎着朝阳读宝书，
    行行都是擎天柱；
    任凭妖风毒雾起，
    红光万里照征途！
    迎着朝阳读宝书，
    页页都是进军鼓；
    千军万马齐奔腾，
    闯出一条革命路！
    迎着朝阳读宝书，
    五洲风云眼前扑；
    地球在咱胸中转，
    世界革命绘宏图！
    迎着朝阳读宝书，
    越读越觉劲头足；
    永远跟着毛主席，
    高举红旗迈大步！
