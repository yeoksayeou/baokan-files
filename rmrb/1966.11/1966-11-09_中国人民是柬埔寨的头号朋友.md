Zhang Qi conveyed Chairman Mao's greetings to Prince Sihanouk and expressed that the Chinese people resolutely support Cambodia's just struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

	New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 8 - On the evening of November 7, the Head of State of Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk, and his wife hosted a banquet to receive Zhang Qi, Vice Chairman of the China-Cambodia Friendship Association, and the entire delegation of the China-Cambodia Friendship Delegation led by her.

	Prince Sihanouk had a very cordial and friendly conversation with Zhang Qi and others during the reception. Zhang Qi conveyed the greetings of Chairman Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders to Prince Sihanouk and handed him a letter from Premier Zhou Enlai.

	Prince Sihanouk and Zhang Qi both spoke at the banquet.

	Prince Sihanouk said in his speech, "You often say that Cambodia is a very sincere and close friend of China. Then I want to tell you that Cambodia considers China and the Chinese people to be its most beloved friends, its number one friends. No matter what happens in the future, we will always be inseparably united with our sister country - China."

	He said, "The Chinese people achieve new successes every year, making your enemies deeply uneasy, but winning the praise of your friends."

	Prince Sihanouk said, "Cambodia will forever be united with China, always marching forward side by side with the Chinese people and all the people who are fighting against old and new colonialism and imperialism."

	"Cambodian people are absolutely convinced that we will achieve joint victory, making the entire Asia belong to the Asians. The Americans and their running dogs and traitors will definitely be defeated."

	Prince Sihanouk proposed a toast to the health and longevity of Chairman Mao Zedong, to the unbreakable Cambodian-Chinese friendship, and to the fighting unity between the peoples of the two countries.

	Zhang Qi, in her speech, warmly praised the achievements of the Kingdom of Cambodia in all aspects under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and warmly praised Cambodia's victorious struggle against the provocations and threats of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to maintain independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

	She said, "Cambodia is clear-cut in its international affairs, pursuing a truly peaceful and neutral policy. You resolutely oppose the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, resolutely uphold the cause of unity against imperialism by the peoples of Indochina and Afro-Asian countries. You speak out justly and uphold justice on major international issues. You have always unequivocally supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression. Because of all this, the Kingdom of Cambodia has made outstanding contributions to the cause of maintaining peace in Southeast Asia and the world, winning the respect and praise of all peace-loving countries and peoples around the world."

	Zhang Qi spoke about the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the brilliant achievements in national construction. She then also spoke about the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism.

	Zhang Qi said, "At a time when U.S. imperialism is plotting to expand the war of aggression on the one hand and concocting a new 'peace talk' deception on the other, and modern revisionism is active everywhere, running around to serve the U.S. 'war-for-peace' grand conspiracy, Cambodia once again stands up and issues a voice of justice."

	Zhang Qi said, "Chairman Mao Zedong said, 'Our common enemy is U.S. imperialism, we are all on the same front, and we all need to unite and support each other.' The Chinese people have always followed Chairman Mao's instructions, always standing with the Cambodian people, resolutely supporting the Cambodian people's just struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and maintaining independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity."

	Zhang Qi expressed her belief that the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries, which has gradually developed on the basis of mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, mutual trust, and mutual support in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism, will continue from generation to generation.

	The speeches of Prince Sihanouk and Zhang Qi were repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

	The banquet was held in a very harmonious and friendly atmosphere.

	Those who attended the reception and banquet also included: Chairman of the Cambodia-China Friendship Association Lan Neth and State Secretary for Health and Arts Didi Nanna, Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Chen Shuliang and his wife.

    中国人民是柬埔寨的头号朋友
    张茜转达了毛主席对西哈努克亲王的问候，表示中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨反对美帝及其仆从侵略的正义斗争。
    新华社金边八日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王和夫人七日晚上接见并设宴招待了中国柬埔寨友好协会副会长张茜和由她率领的中柬友好代表团全体团员。
    西哈努克亲王在接见时同张茜等进行了极其亲切和友好的谈话。张茜向西哈努克亲王转达了毛泽东主席和中国其他领导人对西哈努克亲王的问候，并向他转交了周恩来总理的一封信。
    西哈努克亲王和张茜在宴会上先后讲了话。
    西哈努克亲王在讲话时说：“你们经常说，柬埔寨是中国非常真诚和亲密的朋友。那么我要对你们说，柬埔寨认为中国和中国人民是它最亲爱的朋友，是它的头号朋友。不管将来发生什么事情，我们将永远不可分离地同姐妹般的国家——中国团结在一起。”
    他说，“中国人民每年都取得新的成就，使你们的敌人深感不安，但是却赢得了你们的朋友们的一片赞扬。”
    西哈努克亲王说，“柬埔寨将永远同中国团结在一起，始终同中国人民、同所有为反对新老殖民主义和帝国主义而斗争的人民并肩前进。
    “柬埔寨人民绝对相信，我们将共同取得胜利，使整个亚洲都属于亚洲人，美国人及其走狗和叛徒一定会被打败。”
    西哈努克亲王建议为毛泽东主席的健康和长寿，为牢不可破的柬中友谊，为柬中两国人民之间的战斗团结干杯。
    张茜在讲话中热烈赞扬柬埔寨王国在诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王的领导下，在各方面取得的巨大成就，热烈赞扬柬埔寨为了维护独立、主权和领土完整，对美帝国主义及其走狗的挑衅和威胁，针锋相对地进行的胜利的斗争。
    她说：“柬埔寨在国际事务中，敌友分明，奉行真正的和平中立政策。你们坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决维护印度支那和亚非各国人民团结反帝事业。你们在国际重大问题上，仗义执言，主持公道。你们一直毫不含糊地支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。由于这一切，柬埔寨王国在维护东南亚和世界和平的事业中作出了卓越的贡献，博得了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的尊敬和赞扬。”
    张茜谈到了中国人民，在毛泽东主席领导下，在社会主义文化大革命中所取得的伟大胜利，以及在国家建设方面所取得的辉煌成就。她接着还谈到了越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    张茜说，正当美帝国主义一面阴谋扩大侵略战争，一面策划“和谈”新骗局，现代修正主义四出活动，到处奔走，为美国“以战迫和”的大阴谋效劳的时候，柬埔寨又一次挺身而出，发出正义的呼声。
    张茜说，毛泽东主席说：“我们共同的敌人是美帝国主义，我们大家都是站在一条战线上，大家需要互相团结互相支持。”中国人民一贯遵循毛主席的这一指示，永远同柬埔寨人民站在一起，坚决支持柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其仆从的侵略，维护独立、中立和领土完整的正义斗争。
    张茜表示深信中柬两国人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，在两国互相尊重独立、主权和互相信任、互相支持的基础上，逐步发展起来的战斗友谊，必将世世代代发展下去。
    西哈努克亲王和张茜的讲话都一再被热烈的掌声所打断。
    宴会是在极为和谐和亲切友好的气氛中进行的。
    陪同接见和出席宴会的还有：柬中友协主席兰·涅特和柬埔寨卫生和艺术国务秘书狄弟娜夫人，中国驻柬埔寨大使陈叔亮和夫人。
