Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union have resolved to throw themselves into the fiery Cultural Revolution. They issued a statement pointing out: The more fiercely the Soviet revisionist clique attacks China, the faster they will meet their failure.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 3rd, all Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union issued a statement at a grand welcoming rally held on the 2nd in the capital by revolutionary masses from various sectors and revolutionary students and teachers from various places. The statement expressed extreme indignation and the strongest protest against the new steps taken by the Soviet revisionist leadership to oppose China, and their new crimes of sabotaging Sino-Soviet relations and the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The statement also expressed firm support for the protest note issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Soviet Embassy in China on the 22nd of October.

The statement said: "The real reason the Soviet revisionist leadership expelled us is not that our government wants Soviet students in China to graduate early, but because they are afraid that we will spread Mao Zedong Thought in the Soviet Union, afraid that we will expose their lies of opposing China, afraid that we will tell the Soviet people the truth about China's Cultural Revolution, and afraid that we will establish and develop friendships with the Soviet people. In a word, they fear the people, fear the truth, and fear the revolution."

The statement said: "We want to warn the Soviet revisionist bosses: You can expel us, but you can never expel Mao Zedong Thought that has already entered the hearts of the Soviet people, nor can you expel the friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people from their hearts. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic.' The Soviet revisionist bosses will not escape this logic. Your despicable anti-China actions can only further expose your traitorous faces. The more fiercely you oppose China, the faster you will meet your failure. We firmly believe that one day, the great people nurtured by Lenin will rise up to rebel against Soviet revisionism and throw Soviet revisionism into the dustbin of history."

The statement said: "When we returned to the heart of our great motherland—revolutionary capital Beijing—we were filled with immense excitement. We express our deepest gratitude to our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, for his meticulous care for us, and to the people of our motherland for their firm support and warm welcome. We will definitely follow the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will learn from the people of our motherland and revolutionary youth, and throw ourselves into the great cause of socialist construction and the fiery torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, contributing everything we have to the socialist revolution and construction of our great motherland."

    我留苏学生决心投入到火热的文化大革命中去
    发表声明指出：苏修集团反华愈凶，失败愈快
    据新华社三日讯　我全体留苏学生十一月二日在首都各界革命群众和各地革命师生代表举行的盛大欢迎集会上发表声明，对苏联修正主义领导集团反华的新步骤、破坏中苏两国关系和两国人民友谊的新罪行表示万分愤慨和最强烈的抗议，对我国外交部十月二十二日给苏联驻华大使馆的抗议照会表示坚决支持。
    声明说：“苏联修正主义领导集团赶走我们的真实原因，不是我国政府要苏联留华学生提前毕业，而是他们害怕我们在苏联传播毛泽东思想，害怕我们揭露他们的反华谎言，害怕我们向苏联人民说明中国文化大革命的真相，害怕我们同苏联人民建立和发展友谊。一句话，他们怕人民，怕真理，怕革命。”
    声明说：“我们要正告苏联修正主义老爷们：你们可以把我们赶走，但是绝对赶走不了已经深入苏联人心的毛泽东思想，赶走不了苏联人民心中对中国人民的友谊。毛主席教导我们说：‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。’苏联修正主义老爷们也逃脱不了这个逻辑。你们卑鄙的反华行径，只能进一步暴露你们的叛徒面目。你们反华愈凶，失败也就愈快。我们深信，终有一天，伟大列宁哺育的苏联人民要起来大造苏联修正主义的反，把苏联修正主义扔进历史的垃圾堆。”
    声明说：“当我们回到伟大祖国的心脏——革命首都北京的时刻，我们以万分激动的心情，感谢我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席对我们的无微不至的关怀，感谢祖国人民对我们的坚决支持和热烈欢迎。我们一定要遵照林彪同志的指示，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，向祖国人民和革命青年学习，投身到伟大的社会主义建设事业中，投身到火热的无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中，为我们伟大祖国的社会主义革命和建设事业贡献出我们的一切。”（附图片）
