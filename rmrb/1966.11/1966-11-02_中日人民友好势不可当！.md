	The irresistible momentum of Sino-Japanese friendship!
	Recently, the majority of the leaders of the Japan-China Friendship Association have resolutely fought against a small clique within the association that undermines Sino-Japanese friendship, declared a severance of relations with them, and expressed their determination to fight to the end to maintain and develop Sino-Japanese friendship. At the same time, Japanese businesspeople advocating Sino-Japanese friendship dissolved the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, which was controlled by anti-China elements, and established a new organization. The chairman of the Japan Press Club, Koyama Yuichi, who insists on Sino-Japanese friendship, also resigned from the Japan Press Club. Their just actions have struck a blow to the anti-China plots of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, modern revisionists, and their various followers, defended the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship, and have been warmly welcomed by all who advocate Sino-Japanese friendship. The Chinese people deeply admire and firmly support their fighting spirit in overcoming all difficulties and vigorously promoting the Sino-Japanese friendship movement.

	The Japanese people fully understand that the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan is not only related to the fundamental interests of the Japanese and Chinese peoples but also to peace in Asia and the world. Over the years, the broad masses of the Japanese people and those dedicated to the Sino-Japanese friendship movement have broken through the numerous obstacles set up by U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, made tremendous efforts, and continuously pushed the Sino-Japanese friendship movement forward. With the vigorous development of this movement, the Sino-Japanese friendship movement in Japan has become deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

	U.S. imperialism, the pro-American monopolies, militarists, and other reactionaries in Japan, as well as modern revisionists and their various followers, are extremely alarmed and terrified by the rapid development of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. They are constantly trying to sabotage it. In recent times, they have gone even further, inciting and supporting a small clique of anti-China elements within the Japan-China friendship organizations to carry out anti-China activities under the banner of "Sino-Japanese friendship." They not only use various means to obstruct Japanese youth from coming to China to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival but also obstruct the development of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement in every possible way, attempting to strangle the Sino-Japanese friendship movement and undermine the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

	The broad masses of the Japanese people are the true friends of the Chinese people. They are the ones who insist on the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. Although the reactionaries at home and abroad in Japan have used every means to sabotage the Sino-Japanese friendship movement, the broad masses of the Japanese people have resisted this anti-China current and pushed the movement forward. Recently, the joint statement of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association delegation and the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation, and the statements of the leaders of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement who insist on the correct stance, have been warmly supported by the broad masses of the Japanese people. This fully shows that the historical trend of Sino-Japanese friendship is irresistible.

	The cause of friendship between the Chinese people and the Japanese people is just. Chairman Mao said, "A just cause enjoys abundant support." We believe that the broad masses of the Japanese people and those dedicated to the Sino-Japanese friendship movement, working together, overcoming obstacles, will certainly push the Sino-Japanese friendship movement to a new stage and achieve even greater victories!

    中日人民友好势不可当！
    本报评论员
    最近，日中友好协会的多数领导人，同这个协会中破坏日中友好的一小撮人进行了坚决的斗争，宣布同他们断绝关系，并且表示为维护和发展日中友好而斗争到底。与此同时，日中友好贸易界人士解散了由反华分子把持的日中贸易促进会，成立了新组织。坚持日中友好的日本记者会议主席小林雄一也退出了日本记者会议。他们这种正义的行动，打击了美帝国主义、日本反动派、现代修正主义者及其形形色色追随者的反华阴谋，捍卫了日中友好事业，受到一切主张日中友好的人的热烈欢迎。中国人民对他们这种排除万难、大力推进中日友好运动的斗争精神，表示衷心的敬佩和坚决的支持。
    日本人民完全了解，日中两国人民的友好不仅关系到日本人民和中国人民的根本利益，而且关系到亚洲和世界和平。多年来，日本广大人民和致力于日中友好运动的人士，冲破美帝国主义和日本反动派设置的重重障碍，进行了巨大的努力，把日中友好运动不断地向前推进。随着这个运动的蓬勃开展，日本人民的日中友好运动在日本已深入人心。
    美帝国主义、日本的亲美垄断资本、军国主义者等等反动派和现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者，对于日中友好运动的迅速发展，十分惊慌，怕得要死，无时无刻不在进行破坏。最近以来，他们更变本加厉，唆使和支持日本日中友好机构中的一小撮反华分子，打着“日中友好”的旗子，进行反华活动。他们不仅采取种种手段，阻挠日本青年前来中国参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢，而且在每一件事情上都阻挠日中友好运动的开展，企图扼杀日中友好运动，破坏日中两国人民的战斗友谊。
    广大的日本人民是中国人民的真正朋友。他们是坚持中日友好运动的。虽然日本国内外反动派千方百计破坏日中友好运动，但是，日本广大人民仍然抗住了这股反华逆流，推动这个运动继续前进。最近，中日友协代表团和日中友协代表团的共同声明和坚持正确立场的日中友好运动的领导人的声明，受到日本广大人民的热烈拥护。这充分说明中日友好的历史潮流是不可阻挡的。
    中国人民同日本人民友好的事业，是正义的。毛主席说：“正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”我们相信，日本广大人民和致力于日中友好运动的人士，共同努力，排除障碍，一定能把日中友好运动推向新的阶段，取得更大的胜利！
