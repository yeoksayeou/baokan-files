Today, November 8th, marks the 25th anniversary of the founding of the glorious Albanian Party of Labour.

Twenty-five years ago, on November 8, 1941, the Albanian Party of Labour was born. From that day forward, the heroic Albanian people had a guiding light and a reliable helmsman. Over the past twenty-five years, under the leadership of the Party of Labour headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have written a brilliant chapter in the history of Albania.

The Albanian Party of Labour was born in the midst of the Albanian people's struggle against fascist aggression. At that time, the Albanian people were suffering under the occupation of Italian fascist bandits. As soon as the Party was established, it stood at the forefront of the anti-fascist struggle, calling on the Albanian people to take up arms and wage a resolute fight against the fascist occupiers and traitors. Under the leadership and organization of the Party, the Albanian people ignited the flames of armed resistance. After three years of bloody battles, they finally drove out the German-Italian fascist bandits and became the masters of their own country.

After the end of World War II, the heroic Albanian Party of Labour led the Albanian people onto the path of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The successful completion of three five-year plans has transformed Albania, which was economically backward before liberation, into an advanced socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture. In recent years, the Albanian people have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, bravely smashing the blockade and sabotage by the imperialists, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and the Tito renegade clique. This has made socialist Albania stand firmly on the shores of the Adriatic Sea, becoming a strong red fortress in Europe.

While the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and other countries led by revisionists have already or are in the process of changing colors, from proletarian dictatorship to bourgeois dictatorship, the Albanian Party of Labour has led the Albanian people to uphold proletarian dictatorship. In the political, economic, military, and cultural spheres, a series of revolutionary measures have been taken to prevent capitalist restoration and to resolutely carry the socialist revolution to the end.

The heroic Albanian Party of Labour has raised the banner of opposing revisionism and has engaged in a head-on struggle with modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership clique and its followers. It has unyieldingly exposed and criticized modern revisionism and firmly defended Marxism-Leninism. It has fearlessly stood against violence and threats, adhering to principles and struggling, becoming a strong assault force in the fight against modern revisionism.

The heroic Albanian people have always been at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and reactionaries of all countries, supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. They have consistently and resolutely opposed the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, firmly supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and firmly supported the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They have made outstanding contributions to world peace and the progress of humanity.

For twenty-five years, the Albanian Party of Labour has led the Albanian people with the heroic spirit of "preferring to die standing rather than live kneeling." They have broken through countless difficulties and obstacles, achieving one victory after another. Their fearless spirit, unyielding to intimidation and crushing pressure, and daring to fight against all brutal enemies in the world, has earned the admiration of revolutionary people all over the world.

Chairman Mao's telegram to the Albanian Party of Labour states: "The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, the Yugoslav Tito clique, and all kinds of traitors and scabs, compared to you, are but a handful of yellow earth, while you are soaring mountains. They are slaves and henchmen who kneel before imperialism, while you are daring revolutionaries who dare to fight against imperialism and its running dogs, and dare to fight against all enemies in the world."

Chinese Communists and the Chinese people feel immense honor and pride in having the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people as close comrades-in-arms!

Today, the whole world is watching Tirana. There, the glorious Albanian Party of Labour is holding its Fifth National Congress. We are deeply convinced that this congress, which raises high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, is not only a major historical event in the political life of the Albanian people but will also make significant contributions to the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries.

    耸入云霄的高山
    ——庆祝阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立二十五周年
    欧明
    今天，是光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立二十五周年纪念日。
    二十五年前，一九四一年十一月八日，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党诞生了。从此，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，有了指路的明灯和可靠的舵手。二十五年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的领导下，写下了阿尔巴尼亚历史上光辉灿烂的篇章。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是在阿尔巴尼亚人民反抗法西斯侵略的斗争烈火中诞生的。当时，阿尔巴尼亚人民正处在意大利法西斯强盗占领下的苦难时刻。劳动党一成立，就站在反法西斯斗争的最前列，号召阿尔巴尼亚人民拿起枪杆子，同法西斯占领者和卖国贼进行了坚决的斗争。在劳动党的领导和组织下，阿尔巴尼亚人民燃起了武装反抗的烽火，经过三年的浴血战斗，终于赶走了德意法西斯强盗，自己作了国家的主人。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导阿尔巴尼亚人民，走上了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的道路。三个五年计划的胜利完成，已经把解放前经济落后的阿尔巴尼亚，建成了具有现代工业、集体农业的先进的社会主义国家。近年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，英勇地粉碎了帝国主义、苏共修正主义领导集团、铁托叛徒集团的封锁和破坏，使社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚巍然屹立在亚得里亚海边，成为欧洲的一个坚强的红色堡垒。
    当苏联、南斯拉夫等修正主义集团当权的国家已经或者正在改变颜色，从无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政的时候，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导着阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持无产阶级专政，在政治、经济、军事、文化等领域内采取了一系列革命化措施，防止资本主义复辟，下定决心把社会主义革命进行到底。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，高举反对修正主义的旗帜，同以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义及其追随者，进行了针锋相对的斗争，并且始终站在这一斗争的前列。它无情地揭露和批判了现代修正主义，坚定地捍卫了马克思列宁主义。它不畏强暴、不怕威胁，坚持原则，坚持斗争，是反对现代修正主义的一支坚强的突击队。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在反对帝国主义和各国反动派、支持世界人民革命的斗争中，一向是敢字当头，天不怕，地不怕。它始终不渝地坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争，为世界和平和人类进步事业，作出了卓越的贡献。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党二十五年来领导着阿尔巴尼亚人民，以“宁愿站着死，不愿跪着生”的英雄气概，冲破无数艰难险阻，取得了一个又一个的胜利。它这种吓不倒，压不垮，敢于同世界上一切残暴敌人战斗的大无畏精神，博得了全世界革命人民的敬佩。
    毛主席给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的贺电中说：“苏联修正主义领导集团，南斯拉夫铁托集团，一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，比起你们来，他们都不过是一杯黄土，而你们是耸入云霄的高山。他们是跪倒在帝国主义面前的奴仆和爪牙，你们是敢于同帝国主义及其走狗战斗、敢于同世界上一切暴敌战斗的大无畏的无产阶级革命家。”
    中国共产党人和中国人民，以能有阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民这样的亲密战友，感到无比的光荣，无比的自豪！
    今天，全世界都在注视着地拉那。在那里，光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党正在举行第五次代表大会。我们深信，这一次高举马克思列宁主义红旗的大会，不仅是阿尔巴尼亚人民政治生活中的重大历史事件，而且定将对各国人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派的斗争，作出重大的贡献。
