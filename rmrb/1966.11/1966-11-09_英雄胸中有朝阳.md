	Heroes Have the Morning Sun in Their Hearts

	"The Taking of Tiger Mountain" is a wonderful play that praises Mao Zedong Thought.

	The story of this play takes place in the depths of the forests around Mudanjiang in Northeast China during the Liberation War of 1946, twenty years ago. However, when we watch the play, we do not feel that it is outdated; instead, we find it very familiar and fresh, and we are deeply moved and educated. This is because the play truly highlights Mao Zedong Thought, allowing us to see the victory of Mao Zedong's people's war strategy and to see that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, led personally by Chairman Mao, is a people's army that serves the people completely and thoroughly.

	There are many heroic figures in "The Taking of Tiger Mountain," including Xiao Jianbo, Sun Dacheng, and others, but the most outstanding among them is the reconnaissance platoon leader, Yang Zhirong. Yang Zhirong is wise and very brave. He is loyal to the Party and the people, and for the needs of the revolution, he fears neither sacrifice nor danger. He ventures alone into the bandit stronghold of Tiger Mountain. As the saying goes, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger cub?" Yang Zhirong is indeed a revolutionary hero who knows there are tigers in the mountain but still goes there! He spends the whole day dealing with the bandit leader in Tiger Mountain, facing a very dangerous situation, but relying on his wisdom and bravery, he finally successfully completes the task given to him by the Party. How was this victory achieved? Where did his wisdom and bravery come from? In a word, it is the great Mao Zedong Thought that has armed him!

	When Yang Zhirong was preparing to disguise himself as a bandit and go to Tiger Mountain alone, he requested a mission from Xiao Jianbo. Xiao Jianbo asked him if he was sure. He replied that he had four favorable conditions. After explaining three of them, he told Xiao Jianbo, "The fourth condition is the most important..." Xiao Jianbo, knowing his close comrade-in-arms very well, quickly stepped forward and said for him, "It is the revolutionary soldier's loyalty to the Party and the people!" This part of the play is very good. From this, we can see that Yang Zhirong is indeed a proletarian revolutionary soldier trained and cultivated by Chairman Mao. His heart is filled with the people, and he always thinks of the revolution. Yang Zhirong also sings in the play, "The Party gives me wisdom and courage," and explains that in his struggle against the enemy, "I have the morning sun in my heart." This morning sun in his heart, this source of strength, is the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	Seeing the heroic image of Yang Zhirong in "The Taking of Tiger Mountain," I think: to do revolution, one must be prepared for struggle. Without being prepared to struggle at all times, one cannot talk about revolution. Looking back at the path our village has taken, it is also filled with struggle. On the road to collectivization, the struggle between the two paths was very fierce. Was it the socialist path or the capitalist path? This was a serious class struggle. It was because we poor and lower-middle peasants listened to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely took the socialist path that, through continuous struggle, we achieved today's victory. Even now, this struggle has not stopped. As a revolutionary, in the face of class struggle, whether one dares to struggle or not, and whether one has the spirit of fearlessness, is the key to testing whether one is genuinely loyal to the revolution, whether one is a true revolutionary or a false one, and whether one has truly mastered Mao Zedong Thought.

	We cannot do revolution without Mao Zedong Thought, especially in a situation where class struggle is sharp and complex. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. This is the fundamental reason for all our victories. Yang Zhirong's heroic deeds have set an example for us. In the face of class enemies, he showed the spirit of revolutionary backbone, daring to struggle, being good at struggling, daring to win, and truly deserving to be a glorious Communist Party member. We can be inspired by him and the heroes of the pursuit team!

	In the final scene of "The Taking of Tiger Mountain": The Feast of a Hundred Chickens, Seizing the Tiger on the Mountain.

    英雄胸中有朝阳
    河北省安平县南王庄大队大队长　王玉坤
    《智取威虎山》是一出歌颂毛泽东思想的好戏。
    这出戏的故事，发生在一九四六年解放战争时期的东北牡丹江一带的林海深山中，距离现在已经有二十年了。但是，我们在看戏的时候，并不感觉到事隔久远，相反倒觉得非常亲切、新鲜，很受感动，很受教育。这是因为在这出戏里真正突出了毛泽东思想，让我们看到了毛主席人民战争思想的胜利，看到了由毛主席亲自领导的中国人民解放军，是完全彻底为人民服务的人民军队。
    《智取威虎山》中的英雄人物很多，少剑波、孙达得等等，其中又以侦察排长杨子荣最为突出。杨子荣有智谋，又非常勇敢。他对党和人民忠心耿耿，为了革命的需要，他不怕牺牲，不怕危险，单枪匹马，打进了匪巢威虎山。俗话说，不入虎穴，焉得虎子？杨子荣就是个明知山有虎，偏往虎山行的革命好汉！他在威虎山整天与匪首打交道，处境很险恶，但他凭着智谋和勇敢，终于胜利地完成了党交给他的任务。这胜利是怎么取得的，他的智谋和勇敢又是从哪儿来的呢？一句话，是伟大的毛泽东思想武装了他！
    当杨子荣准备化装成土匪、只身上威虎山的前夕，他向少剑波请求任务。少剑波问他有没有把握？他回答自己有四个有利条件。讲完三个以后，他跟少剑波说：“这第四个条件最重要……”少剑波对自己的亲密战友非常了解，连忙抢上一步替他说了出来：“就是革命军人对党、对人民的赤胆忠心！”这段戏真好，从这里可以看出，杨子荣正是毛主席教导和培养出来的无产阶级革命战士，他的心里装着人民，处处想到的是革命。杨子荣在戏里也唱道：“党给我智慧给我胆”，还说明自己在和敌人斗争中“胸中有朝阳”，这胸中的朝阳，这力量的源泉，就是伟大的毛泽东思想。
    看到《智取威虎山》中杨子荣的英雄形象，我想到：干革命就要准备斗争，没有时时刻刻要参加斗争的准备，也就谈不上革命。回想我们村走过来的道路，也是充满了斗争的。在集体化的道路上，两条道路的斗争是很激烈的。走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路，这是一场严重的阶级斗争。我们贫下中农正是听了毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义的道路，经过不断的斗争才取得了今天的胜利。到现在，这个斗争并没有停止。作为一个革命者，在阶级斗争面前敢不敢去斗争，有没有不怕死的精神，正是考验一个人对革命是不是赤胆忠心，是真革命还是假革命，是不是真的把毛泽东思想学到了手的关键。
    我们干革命是离不开毛泽东思想的，特别是在阶级斗争比较尖锐、复杂的形势下，要时时刻刻记住毛主席的教导，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。这是我们取得一切胜利的根本。杨子荣的英雄事迹为我们树立了榜样。他在阶级敌人面前，表现了革命的硬骨头精神，敢于斗争，善于斗争，敢于胜利，不愧是个光荣的共产党员，我们可以从他和追剿队英雄们的身上受到鼓舞！（附图片）
