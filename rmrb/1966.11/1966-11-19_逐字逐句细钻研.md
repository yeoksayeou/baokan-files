	Study Each Word and Sentence Thoroughly
	Stand Firm

	In the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao praised Comrade Norman Bethune for having "no selfish motives," for being "selfless and dedicated to the welfare of others," and for having "no selfishness or self-interest." These three sentences each use the word "not a bit."

	Comrade Wang Jianshi, in his study, repeatedly pondered over these three words and three sentences, carefully analyzing them. He felt that these three "not a bit" words are Chairman Mao's highest praise and summary of Comrade Norman Bethune's great communist spirit; at the same time, they are the highest standard for our ideological transformation: to revolutionize, one must thoroughly eliminate personal interests and establish public interests, without the slightest personal consideration; one must thoroughly transform the bourgeois worldview and truly establish a selfless proletarian worldview. Comrade Wang Jianshi takes these three "not a bit" words as a standard, using Chairman Mao's words to examine himself every day. Even the slightest trace of selfish thoughts hidden deep in the soul can be exposed in time, leaving no room for them to hide, thus continuously achieving new victories in ideological transformation.

	Every word and sentence in Chairman Mao's books are truths. Each word, each sentence, contains the richest thoughts and the deepest revolutionary principles; each word, each sentence, is the highest guideline for our actions and the most powerful weapon to strike the enemy. To read Chairman Mao's books, one must study each word and sentence thoroughly, ponder over them again and again, and truly understand their essence. One must let every word and sentence Chairman Mao said penetrate one's thoughts and be put into action. Comrade Wang Jianshi's serious and diligent learning spirit is truly worthy of great promotion.

    逐字逐句细钻研
    立影
    在《纪念白求恩》这篇文章里，毛主席赞扬白求恩同志“毫无利己的动机”，“毫不利己专门利人”，“毫无自私自利之心”。三句话用了三个“毫”字。
    王建世同志在学习中，对这三个字、三句话反复琢磨，仔细钻研。他体会到：这三个“毫”字，是毛主席对白求恩同志伟大共产主义精神的高度评价和高度概括；同时，也是对我们每个同志提出的思想改造的最高标准：要革命，就要彻底地破“私”立“公”，不能有丝毫个人打算；就要彻底改造资产阶级世界观，真正树立一心为公的无产阶级世界观。王建世同志把这三个“毫”字当作标准，天天用毛主席的话检查自己。哪怕是隐藏在灵魂深处的一丝一毫的私心杂念，也能及时地把它揪出来，不给它任何藏身之地，从而使自己的思想改造，不断取得新的胜利。
    毛主席的书，字字句句都是真理。每一个字，每一句话，都包含着最丰富的思想内容，最深刻的革命道理；每一个字，每一句话，都是我们行动的最高准则，都是打击敌人的最有力的武器。读毛主席的书，就要逐字逐句地仔细钻研，一遍又一遍地反复琢磨，认真领会精神实质，把毛主席说的每一个字，每一句话，都渗透在自己的思想里，贯彻到自己的行动中去。王建世同志这种认真、刻苦的学习精神，值得大大提倡。
