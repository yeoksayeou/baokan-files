North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement Denouncing U.S. Imperialist Military Provocations
North Korean People Will Completely Annihilate Invaders

According to Xinhua News Agency in Pyongyang, on the 6th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 5th denouncing the new military provocations by U.S. imperialism along the military demarcation line. The statement said that recently, the invading forces of U.S. imperialism and the puppet forces of South Korea have brazenly trampled on the Korean Armistice Agreement and further intensified their armed attacks and various military provocations against North Korea.

The statement said that on October 20th, the invading forces of U.S. imperialism and the puppet forces of South Korea mobilized several tanks and shelled the North's Magi Island. On the same day, they also fired hundreds of various bullets in the eastern and central parts of the demilitarized zone. On November 3rd, in several places along the military demarcation line, dozens of U.S. puppet armed personnel separately invaded the North's territory, threw hand grenades at sentry posts, fired thousands of bullets, and set fires, carrying out planned armed attacks.

The statement emphasized that the armed attacks by the invading forces of U.S. imperialism and the puppet forces of South Korea along the military demarcation line against North Korea have reached 33 times from October 20th to November 3rd.

The statement said that due to the North's adoption of corresponding self-defense measures, the armed attacks by the invading forces of U.S. imperialism have all been repelled.

The statement sternly warned U.S. imperialism and the Park Chung-hee puppet clique that no matter when and where they invade North Korea, the North Korean people will give them annihilating blows and completely annihilate them.

    朝鲜外务省发表声明谴责美帝军事挑衅
    朝鲜人民将彻底消灭入侵者
    据新华社平壤六日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省五日就美帝国主义在军事分界线一带进行新的军事挑衅发表声明说，最近，美帝国主义侵略军和南朝鲜傀儡军粗暴地蹂躏朝鲜停战协定，并进一步加强反对朝鲜北半部的武装攻击和各种军事挑衅行动。
    声明说，十月二十日，美帝国主义侵略军和南朝鲜傀儡军动员了好几辆坦克，炮击了朝方的鹊岛，同日，又在非军事地区东部和中部地区发射了数百发各种枪弹。十一月三日，在军事分界线的好几个地点，数十名美伪武装人员分别侵入朝方地区，向岗哨投掷手榴弹、发射数千发子弹和放火等，进行有计划的武装攻击。
    声明强调指出，美帝国主义侵略军和南朝鲜傀儡军在军事分界线向朝鲜北半部进行的这种武装攻击，仅从十月二十日到十一月三日就达三十三次。
    声明说，由于朝方采取相应的自卫措施，美帝国主义侵略者的这种武装攻击都一一被击退了。
    声明严厉警告美帝国主义和朴正熙傀儡集团，不管它们在任何时刻侵入朝鲜北半部的任何地方，朝鲜人民都将给予歼灭性的打击，彻底加以消灭。
