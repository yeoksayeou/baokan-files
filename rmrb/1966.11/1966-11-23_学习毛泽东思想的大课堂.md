Edition: 6

Our "Long March Red Guards" set out from Liaoning Chaoyang in the afternoon of October 25, carrying our luggage, holding the "Long March Red Guards" banner, and heading towards the capital.

Along the way, we distributed leaflets to the masses, spreading Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We armed ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, overcame various difficulties, and arrived at the place where our most beloved leader Chairman Mao resides—Beijing—at around 3:00 AM on November 7. We walked 1,200 li on foot.

Our successful long march is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought. Our determination is to face the wind and rain, see the world, and study Mao Zedong Thought. On the long march, we had the best political class.

On the road, our feet blistered, our legs ached, and our luggage seemed to get heavier. But we thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." We spontaneously recited this passage and sang it. Chairman Mao's teachings became our daily spiritual nourishment. We recited and sang it dozens of times every day. Each recitation and each song gave us boundless strength, forgetting fatigue, boosting our courage, and striding forward.

When we reached the border between Liaoning Province and Hebei Province, we encountered a steep and slippery mountain. What should we do? Thinking of the poem "The Red Army is not afraid of the long march's difficulties, ten thousand waters and mountains are just trivial matters..." we gained energy and decided to cross it. After about two hours of climbing, we finally succeeded.

November 6 was our most tiring day. We summarized our achievements according to Chairman Mao's teachings: we had walked 1,000 li, and there were only about 200 li left to Chairman Mao. Hearing that we were close to Chairman Mao, we were even more encouraged and decided to fight continuously. We sang songs like "The Great Sea Voyage Needs a Helmsman," "Strive for Victory," and "The Workers' Hard Bones" as we walked. In the most difficult times, we encouraged each other. Some said, "This little difficulty is nothing; Jiang Jing had ten fingers pierced with bamboo splinters and was not afraid; Liu Hulan was fearless under the guillotine." Others said, "Chairman Mao told us: 'The most beautiful scenery is on the dangerous peaks.'" A classmate with blistered feet found it hard to walk, but after hearing this poem, he quickened his pace, took the red flag, and walked to the front of the team. We all had a common belief: every step brings us closer to Tiananmen Square. As long as we don't stop, we will definitely arrive. We walked and walked, our eyes fixed on the front, and finally, we arrived!

When Chairman Mao met with us, we were so happy that we couldn't express it. We wanted to tell Chairman Mao that we came according to your teachings. We wanted to say so many things, but we couldn't say them all at once. We just shouted loudly, "Long live Chairman Mao!" ...

The long march is a great classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought and learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Along the way, we met many workers and peasants who asked us to greet Chairman Mao on their behalf. A 60-year-old old community member excitedly said, "When you go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, please shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' for me many times!" A 20-something young community member asked us, "When you return from Beijing, come to my house again, tell us about seeing Chairman Mao, and let me share your happiness." When we ate at the home of an old woman named Shi, the old woman said to us, "The food we eat is all given by Chairman Mao. We poor and lower-middle peasants can stand up because of Chairman Mao's leadership. In the past, landlords ate well and dressed well, while poor and hired peasants only had to work for them. Now it is the people's world. You young people can go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, which is too happy. If it were the past, you would have to work hard for the landlords." The old peasant woman's words made us deeply understand that today's happy life is the result of Chairman Mao leading the Chinese working people's struggle. These words are so profound!

One day, we stayed at a production brigade and saw the community members fertilizing. We also helped with the work. A community member said to us, "You are like the PLA. Wherever you go, no matter how tired you are, you put down your luggage and start working. You are really great." At dinner, the brigade leader personally served us food, which moved us so much that we didn't know what to say. Along the way, no matter where we stayed, the poor and lower-middle peasants warmly received us, boiled water for us, heated the kang (brick bed) for us, and gave us quilts. We deeply felt the class feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the warmth of the socialist big family. Truly: "Father and mother are not as close as Chairman Mao, the river is not as deep as class love."

Our personal experience proves that walking for revolutionary linkage is great! We are determined to always follow Chairman Mao in the great winds and waves, to grow stronger, to study Chairman Mao's books more diligently, to listen to Chairman Mao's words, and to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will care about national affairs, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and always follow Chairman Mao's teachings on the revolutionary road, always advancing!

    学习毛泽东思想的大课堂
    辽宁朝阳师范长征红卫队七个红卫兵
    我们“长征红卫队”，于十月二十五日下午由辽宁朝阳出发，背着行李，怀揣宝书，举着“长征红卫队”的旗帜，向首都前进。
    我们沿途向群众散发传单，宣传毛泽东思想，宣传无产阶级文化大革命。我们用毛泽东思想武装自己，战胜了种种困难，于十一月七日凌晨三点多钟，胜利地到达了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席居住的地方——北京。我们一路步行一千二百里。
    我们这次长征的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。我们的决心是经风雨，见世面，学习毛泽东思想。在长征路上，我们上了一堂最好的政治课。
    在路上，脚打泡了，腿酸了，行李好像越背越重。但是，我们想到毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”就不约而同地念起这段语录，唱了起来。毛主席的这个教导，成了我们每天的精神食粮，我们每天都几十遍地念，几百遍地唱。每念一遍、唱一遍都增加无穷的力量，忘掉了疲劳，提高了勇气，大踏步地向前迈进。
    我们走到辽宁省和河北省的交界处，遇到一座大山，又陡又滑，怎么办呢？一想到“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲……”这首诗，我们就来了劲，下定决心翻过去。经过约两小时的攀越，我们终于胜利了。
    十一月六日，是我们最疲劳的一天。我们按照毛主席的教导总结了一下成绩：已走完一千里路了，离毛主席只有二百多里路了。一听说快到毛主席身边了，就更加鼓起勇气，决定来个连续作战。我们边走边唱《大海航行靠舵手》《争取胜利》《工人阶级硬骨头》等歌曲。我们在最困难的时候互相鼓励。有的说：“咱这点困难算什么？江姐十个手指钉竹签子都不怕；刘胡兰在铡刀下都毫不畏惧。”有的说：“毛主席告诉我们：‘无限风光在险峰’。”有的同学脚起泡了，走路很费劲，听了这句诗，加紧了脚步，接过红旗，走到队伍最前边去。我们都有一个共同的信念：走一步，就离天安门近一步，只要不停，一定会到的。我们走哇，走哇，眼睛望着前方走哇，终于走到了！
    在毛主席接见我们红卫兵的时候，我们欢乐的心情不知怎样说才好。我们想对毛主席说，我们照您的教导，走来了。我们想说许许多多话，但是一时都说不出来，只是使劲地喊：“毛主席万岁！”……
    长征是学习毛泽东思想的大课堂，也是向工农兵学习的大课堂。路上接触许多工农群众，都让我们替他们向毛主席问好。一个六十多岁的老社员激动地说：“到北京见到毛主席，可要替我多喊几声万岁！”一个二十多岁的青年社员要求我们：“从北京回来后，再到我家住，给我们介绍见到毛主席的情形，让我同享你们的幸福。”我们在一个姓石的老大娘家吃饭的时候，大娘对我们说：“我们吃的饭都是毛主席给的，咱们贫下中农能翻身，都是毛主席领导的。过去地主吃好的，穿好的，贫雇农只得给人家扛活。现在是人民的天下，你们年青人能到北京见到毛主席，太幸福了。要是过去，都得给地主扛大活去。……”贫农老大娘这些话，使我们更深刻地懂得了今天的幸福生活是毛主席领导中国劳动人民斗争得来的。这些话意味多么深长啊！
    有一天，我们在一个大队住宿，看到社员正在起粪，我们也就帮着干起来。一个社员对我们说：“你们跟解放军一样，到哪里，不管怎样累，放下行李就干活，真是好样的。”晚上吃饭的时候，队长亲自给我们端菜，使我们感动得不知说什么好了。一路上，我们不论住在哪里，贫下中农都热情招待我们，给我们烧热水、烧炕、送被子，使我们深深地体会到了贫下中农的阶级感情，体会到了社会主义大家庭的温暖。真是：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，河深海深不如阶级友爱深。”
    我们亲身的体验证明：徒步进行革命串连，好得很！我们决心永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪里锻炼成长，更加努力地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。我们要关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，要在革命路上永远照毛主席的教导去做，永远前进！
