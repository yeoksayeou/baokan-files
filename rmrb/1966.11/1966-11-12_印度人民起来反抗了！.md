The Indian people have risen up in rebellion! In New Delhi, a massive demonstration of 700,000 people took place. This is a major outbreak of anti-government sentiment among the Indian people, a necessary result of the reactionary policies pursued by the Indian reactionaries both domestically and internationally, and a reflection of the sharpening class contradictions within India.

The Indian reactionaries have been increasingly aligning themselves with American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, becoming their obedient lackeys. Domestically, they have been implementing a policy of intensified plunder and suppression against the people, driving the country's economy to the brink of collapse and plunging the people into a state of misery. Oppression inevitably leads to resistance. The Indian people have risen up in rebellion!

In recent times, the storm of student anti-government struggles in India has been surging, wave after wave. Four cities in the south have seen anti-government uprisings. Almost all the cities in Andhra Pradesh have witnessed school strikes, worker strikes, and market closures in a mass movement. The unprecedented large-scale demonstration in New Delhi is a continuation and development of the people's resistance across the entire country.

Faced with the Indian people rising up in rebellion, the Indian government has resorted to all the usual methods of reactionaries: brutal suppression. In this incident alone, over 500 people were killed or injured in the capital. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi shouted hysterically that she was prepared to "suppress it at any cost." This further exposes the savage and reactionary nature of the Congress Party government.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The various reactionaries in the world... whatever oppression the reactionaries inflict on the revolutionary people, in the final analysis, can only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." The more the Indian government suppresses the people, the more it will provoke strong resistance from the people. This is an objective law that cannot be changed by human will.

India belongs to the great Indian people. The forward march of the Indian people is unstoppable by any force.

    印度人民起来反抗了！
    本报评论员
    新德里发生了七十万人参加的反政府大示威。这是印度人民反抗政府情绪的大爆发，是印度反动派所奉行的内外反动政策的必然结果，是印度国内阶级矛盾尖锐化的反映。
    印度反动派对外加紧投靠美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团，死心塌地充当它们的卑顺的奴才；对内实行加紧掠夺和镇压的反人民政策，使国家的经济濒于破产，人民生活在水深火热之中。有压迫，就有反抗。印度人民起来反抗了！
    最近以来，印度学生反政府斗争的风暴，此伏彼起，一浪高过一浪。南部四个城市爆发了反政府的暴动。安得拉邦几乎所有的城市里，发生了学校罢课，工人罢工，商店罢市的群众运动。新德里这次规模空前的大示威，是全印各地人民群众反抗怒潮的继续和发展。
    面对奋起反抗的印度人民，印度政府采取了一切反动派所惯用的办法：武力镇压。仅在印度首都，这一次就打死打伤了五百多人。印度政府总理英迪拉·甘地还声嘶力竭地说，准备“不惜代价把它镇压下去”。这就进一步暴露了国大党政府的反动凶残面目。
    毛主席教导我们：“各国反动派……对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”印度政府对人民镇压得越凶，就越会激起人民强烈的反抗。这是不以人们的意志为转移的客观规律。
    印度是属于伟大的印度人民的。印度人民前进的步伐，是任何力量也阻挡不住的。
