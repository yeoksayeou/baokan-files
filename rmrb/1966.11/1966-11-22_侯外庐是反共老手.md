For a long time, Hou Wailu has been parading around as a "Marxist historian" authority. But once you peel off the mask, he turns out to be an old hand at anti-communism, flattering Chiang Kai-shek, and idolizing the United States.

As far back as the Anti-Japanese War, Hou Wailu viciously attacked the great Chinese Communist Party and madly opposed many of the wise directives of our great leader Chairman Mao. At the same time, he beautified the fascist rule of Chiang Kai-shek and imperialism in every possible way.

In May 1937, Chairman Mao delivered the report "The Tasks of the Chinese Communist Party in the Period of Resistance Against Japan" and "Struggle for the United Front of the Anti-Japanese National United Front with Hundreds of Millions of People." Chairman Mao clearly pointed out that to establish a genuine and solid anti-Japanese national united front, mobilize the people to enter the anti-Japanese war, and achieve victory in defending the motherland and recovering lost territories, it is necessary to immediately begin democratic reforms, abolish the reactionary dictatorship of one party and one class by the Kuomintang, and implement the freedom of speech, assembly, and association for the people. He also pointed out, "Democracy is the guarantee of resistance against Japan, and resistance against Japan provides favorable conditions for the development of the democratic movement." At that time, Hou Wailu jumped out to fiercely attack Chairman Mao's directives. He ranted, "The so-called 'resistance against Japan above all else' is to say that the struggle for internal democracy does not hinder the struggle for external democracy. Specifically, internal democracy is definitely a lower form... There is no value in the debate between 'resistance against Japan first, democracy first.' Because the subjective proposal of an extremely high level of democracy is indeed detrimental to the resistance movement." He also tried his best to whitewash Chiang Kai-shek, saying, "China does not have the social conditions for fascism, so naturally, there is no fascist dictatorship." Since there is no fascist dictatorship, isn't the struggle for democracy a meaningless slogan? This is a blatant attack on the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, defending the fascist dictatorship of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries.

In 1938, the Kuomintang reactionaries openly shouted "One Doctrine," intending to use their reactionary Three Principles of the People to oppose communism. The bandit Ye Qing immediately came out to assist, saying, "The Three Principles of the People can satisfy all the requirements of China now and in the future. Once realized, China will no longer need socialism, and thus, there will be no need to organize a party to struggle for socialism." In this wave of arrogant anti-communism, Hou Wailu also closely followed, applauding and echoing. He ranted that the Three Principles of the People have "the same nature and development as socialism and communism," "the Principle of the People's Livelihood is the theoretical leadership system of the objective development of Chinese society," "communism is a part of the Principle of the People's Livelihood, and socialism is an even larger part of the Principle of the People's Livelihood." He also ranted that "the success of the Russian revolution is the realization of the Russian-style Three Principles of the People." Hou Wailu and the likes of Ye Qing, under the banner of "One Doctrine," sang the same tune. Their evil intentions, as Chairman Mao criticized, "The essence is the stubborn elements' bourgeois dictatorship. Denying communism is actually denying the united front. The stubborn elements precisely want to implement their one-party doctrine, deny the united front, and thus create those absurd statements denying communism."

In January 1940, Chairman Mao published the great historical document "On New Democracy," refuting the reactionary dream of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries to establish a bourgeois dictatorship and pointing out that China cannot follow the path of developing capitalism. At this time, Hou Wailu came out to oppose again. He shouted, "Some people often say that China's state-building is 'non-capitalist,' which is like saying it is neither cow nor horse, without specifying the issue." Just as Chiang Kai-shek launched three waves of anti-communist campaigns, the Kuomintang reactionaries' hired penmen all came out, vigorously preparing public opinion, and under the name of "mass organizations," demanded the dissolution of the Chinese Communist Party. Hou Wailu also, according to Chiang Kai-shek's needs, openly shouted, "The various parties and factions united in the Anti-Japanese National United Front, led by the Kuomintang to resist Japan, is based on the people's demands; the Communist Party, which declares to struggle for the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, participates in the anti-Japanese struggle under the unified structure of the National Government, and performs the task of national liberation, is also the people's demand." Left and right, "the people's demand," merely to confirm the Kuomintang's political leadership position. He also threatened the Communist Party, saying, "If a party betrays its historical mission and goes against the people's demands, that party is the enemy of the people." Hou Wailu's passage is his confession of anti-communism and anti-people, exposing his ugly face as a henchman for the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek.

Hou Wailu's flattery of Chiang Kai-shek reached the point of shamelessness. In 1940, Chiang Kai-shek was closely colluding with the Japanese invaders and traitors, and his reactionary face of actively opposing communism was already known to all. Hou Wailu, in May of that year, actually praised this tyrant and traitor to the nation. He said, "The Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, use the strength of the entire nation to engage in a decisive battle with the Japanese invaders... wash away national humiliation and strive for an independent democratic republic of China!" Even after Chiang Kai-shek had launched several waves of anti-communist campaigns in 1942, Hou Wailu still said, "The Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, have made contributions to resisting global tyranny by linking their interests with the bright life of all humanity."

Hou Wailu spared no effort to whitewash and sing praises for the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek. He even claimed that living in such a fascist environment was a "blessing" and worthy of "pride." He said, "Our government is now leading the youth in war and nation-building, leading the youth in revolution, leading the youth in the anti-fascist war. Our spirit is not painful. Compared to the youth in fascist countries living in a dark hell, we are still proud."

Hou Wailu turned Chiang Kai-shek, this arch-criminal of anti-communism and betrayal of the nation, into a national hero; he tried his best to beautify the hell on earth under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang into a paradise. This is truly reactionary to the extreme, the most shameless!

Hou Wailu also went to great lengths to beautify the aggression of imperialism. He ranted, "China, 'progressive Asia,' thanks to the imperialist opium holy medicine mixed with the input of democratic freedom into China, and even more thanks to the fascist heroin syringe combined with the construction of socialism's brightness input into China." The fundamental reason for the Japanese imperialists to turn China into their colony is the invasion of China by the Japanese invaders. Hou Wailu, however, turned black into white, blaming the invasion of the Japanese invaders on the Chinese Communist Party, even saying, "China's internal strife aroused the invasion of the Japanese invaders." He even praised the treasonous treaties signed by Chiang Kai-shek with British and American imperialism, the Sino-American and Sino-British treaties, as "a new page in modern Chinese history, also a valuable contribution to international relations, and an indispensable step towards the ideal world of humanity." He shamelessly said that these unequal treaties had "removed the shackles and unreasonable burdens imposed on the Chinese people for a hundred years." Where does Hou Wailu have any backbone as a Chinese? He has completely degenerated into a running dog and servant of imperialism.

The so-called "consistently progressive" Hou Wailu is originally a henchman of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries and imperialist invaders. Our great country has been established for seventeen years, but the bourgeois reactionary historians like Hou Wailu still occupy the historical field, spreading poisonous weeds, and preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. In this great proletarian cultural revolution, we must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strike back at Hou Wailu, this consistently anti-communist, flattering Chiang, and idolizing America counter-revolutionary, and drive him out of the Marxist historical field!

    侯外庐是反共老手
    史红兵
    长期以来，侯外庐一直以“马克思主义史学权威”的面目到处招摇撞骗。但是揭开画皮一看，他原来是个反共、媚蒋、崇美的老手。
    远在抗日战争时期，侯外庐就恶毒地攻击伟大的中国共产党，疯狂地反对我们伟大领袖毛主席的许多英明指示。与此同时，他对蒋介石的法西斯统治和帝国主义却百般美化。
    一九三七年五月，毛主席作了《中国共产党在抗日时期的任务》及《为争取千百万群众进入抗日民族统一战线而斗争》的报告。毛主席明确指出，为了建立真正的坚实的抗日民族统一战线，动员人民进入抗日战争，取得保卫祖国和收复失地的胜利，必须立即开始实行民主改革，废除国民党一党、一阶级的反动独裁政体，实行人民的言论、集会、结社自由。并且指出：“民主是抗日的保证，抗日能给予民主运动发展以有利条件。”那时候，侯外庐却跳出来大肆攻击毛主席的指示。他胡说什么：“所谓抗日高于一切，是指对内民主的奋斗不妨害于对外民主的争取，具体讲来，对内民主一定是一个低级的形式，……没有什么‘抗日第一，民主第一’的争论价值。因为极高度民主形式的主观提出，实在有碍于抗日运动的。”他还竭力为蒋介石涂脂抹粉，说什么：“中国没有法西斯的社会条件，自然亦没有法西斯的独裁。”既然没有法西斯独裁，争取民主岂不成了一个无的放矢的口号？这是明目张胆地攻击共产党和毛主席，为蒋介石反动派的法西斯独裁统治进行辩护。
    一九三八年，国民党反动派公开叫嚷“一个主义”，要以他们的反动的三民主义来反对共产主义。托匪叶青立即出来效劳，他说：“三民主义可以满足中国现在和将来的一切要求，它一实现，中国便不需要社会主义了，从而组织一个党来为社会主义而奋斗的事也就不必要了。”在这嚣张的反共声浪中，侯外庐也紧紧跟上，捧场帮腔。他胡说什么三民主义“有社会主义、共产主义的同一性与发展性”，“民生主义是客观中国社会发展的理论领导系统”，“共产主义是民生主义的一部分，社会主义是民生主义更大的一部分”。他还胡说什么“俄国革命成功是俄国性的三民主义的实现”。侯外庐和叶青之流在“一个主义”的招牌下，唱的完全是一个调子。他们的险恶用心，正如毛主席批驳的：“其本质就是顽固分子们的资产阶级专制主义。”“否认共产主义，实际上就是否认统一战线。顽固派也正是要奉行其一党主义，否认统一战线，才造出那些否认共产主义的荒谬说法来。”
    一九四○年一月，毛主席发表了具有伟大历史意义的《新民主主义论》，驳斥了蒋介石反动派想搞资产阶级专政的反动梦想，指出中国决不能走发展资本主义的道路。这时候，侯外庐又出来反对了。他叫嚣：“有些人常说，中国建国是‘非资本主义的’，这等于说是非牛的，非马的，而没有规定了的问题。”正当蒋介石发动三次反共高潮时，国民党反动派的御用文人纷纷出动，极力准备舆论，以所谓“民众团体”的名义，要求解散中国共产党。侯外庐也按照蒋介石的需要，公然叫嚷：“团结在抗日民族统一战线之各党各派，由国民党领导抗日，是基于民众的要求；宣布为实行革命的三民主义而奋斗的共产党在国民政府统一机构下参加抗日，执行民族解放任务，亦是民众的要求。”左一个“民众的要求”，右一个“民众的要求”，无非是要肯定国民党的政治领导地位。他还威胁共产党说：“如果有一党违背历史的使命，违反民众的要求，这一党便是人民的公敌。”侯外庐的这一段文字，是他反共反人民的自白书，把他为人民公敌蒋介石充当帮凶的丑恶嘴脸暴露无遗了。
    侯外庐吹捧蒋介石，达到了厚颜无耻的地步。一九四○年，蒋介石与日寇、汉奸紧密勾结，积极反共的反动面目，已经是路人皆知了。侯外庐在这年五月，竟对这个独夫民贼、民族败类大肆吹捧。他说：“中国人民用全民族的团结力量，在蒋委员长领导之下，和日寇决战，……洗清国耻，而为独立的中华民主共和国而奋斗！”及至蒋介石已经发动了几次反共高潮以后的一九四二年，侯外庐还说：“中国人民在蒋委员长领导之下，对于反抗世界暴政的贡献，是把自己的利益和全世界人类的光明生活联系无间。”
    侯外庐挖空心思地为国民党蒋介石的反动统治涂脂抹粉，歌功颂德。他居然声称生活在那种法西斯统治的环境中是一种“幸福”，值得“自傲”。他这样说：“我们的政府现在领导青年抗战建国，领导青年革命，领导青年反法西斯战争，我们的精神是不痛苦的，我们比之世界上法西斯国家的青年在黑暗地狱中过生活，我们还是自傲的。”
    侯外庐把蒋介石这样一个反共卖国的罪魁，着意改扮成为民族英雄；把国民党的反动统治下的人间地狱，竭力美化为天堂乐园。这真是反动透顶，无耻之尤！
    侯外庐对帝国主义的侵略，也极尽美化之能事。他胡说什么：“中国，‘进步的亚洲’，感谢帝国主义的鸦片圣品麻醉剂夹着民主主义的自由输入中国，更感谢法西斯主义的海洛英吗啡针配合着社会主义建设的光明输入中国。”日本帝国主义要变中国为它的殖民地，这是日寇侵略中国的根本原因。侯外庐却颠倒黑白，把日寇的侵略归罪于中国共产党，竟然说什么“中国的内乱，唤起日寇的侵略”。他甚至把蒋介石与英美帝国主义所签订的卖国的中美、中英条约，吹捧成“中国近代史的新页，亦是国际关系间的宝贵贡献，更是人类理想世界所必不可忽视的一步境界”。他无耻地说这些不平等条约是：“已将百年来加于中国人民的枷锁与不合理的负荷，由此解除。”侯外庐哪里还有一点中国人的骨气？他已经完全堕落为帝国主义的走狗和奴才了。
    所谓“一贯进步”的侯外庐，原来是蒋介石反动派和帝国主义侵略者的帮凶。我们伟大的国家成立十七年了，但是侯外庐之流的资产阶级反动史学“权威”，仍霸占着史学阵地，大放毒草，为资本主义复辟进行舆论准备。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，迎头痛击侯外庐这个一贯反共、媚蒋、崇美的反革命分子，把他从马克思主义历史学的阵地上清除出去！
