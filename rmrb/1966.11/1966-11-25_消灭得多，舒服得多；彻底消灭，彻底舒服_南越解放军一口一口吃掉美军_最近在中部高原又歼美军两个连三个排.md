The South Vietnamese Liberation Army is eating away at the American forces bit by bit. Recently, in the Central Highlands, they annihilated two companies and three platoons of American troops.

The day of burial for American imperialism and all other harmful elements is not far off, as they have already prepared their own gravediggers.

	HANOI, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the military and people of Kontum Province in South Vietnam completely annihilated two companies of U.S. aggressor troops on Nov. 19.

	The battle took place on the banks of the Sa Thay River, about 28 kilometers northwest of Pleiku. On Nov. 19, two companies of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, invaded the area northwest of Pleiku. The Liberation Armed Forces bravely and cleverly gave the invading enemy a crushing blow, completely and thoroughly annihilating them. The enemy's reinforcements, fearing they would meet the same fate, hurriedly retreated.

	Thus, from Oct. 26 to Nov. 19, the Liberation Armed Forces of Kontum Province, in close coordination with the Liberation Armed Forces of Pleiku Province, consecutively annihilated an entire battalion and six companies, two artillery companies, and one mortar platoon of U.S. infantry in the areas northwest of Pleiku and east and west of the Sa Thay River; destroyed 17 artillery pieces and mortars; completely annihilated four companies of the puppet special forces, shot down four enemy aircraft, and seized a large quantity of weapons and war materials.

	HANOI, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) — According to reports from Saigon, the Liberation Army of South Vietnam completely annihilated three platoons of U.S. aggressor troops near Pleiku City in the Central Highlands on Nov. 21.

	According to reports from Western news agencies, three platoons of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) were heavily attacked by the Liberation Army near the Cambodian border. The surviving U.S. soldiers admitted that "almost everyone in these three platoons was either killed or wounded."

	It is also reported that the battle in Pleiku is still continuing. The command post of a regiment of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division came under heavy artillery fire from the Liberation Army on Nov. 22. In addition, the puppet military command in Saigon admitted that on the same day, the Liberation Army also attacked a puppet military outpost more than 120 kilometers southwest of Saigon, causing heavy casualties among the defending forces.

	HANOI, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) — The Liberation Radio of South Vietnam recently commented that the brilliant victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam in the first half of November are a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors' second "dry season offensive" plan.

	The commentary pointed out that up to now, the United States has sent more than 350,000 troops to South Vietnam, but it is still in a state of confusion and unable to cope. The U.S. troops are running around, but in the end, they still cannot escape the punishment they deserve in the Central Highlands, the Central Coast, and the Southeast.

	The commentary said that the military failures of the U.S.-puppet clique have made their political situation even more chaotic, and the morale of the U.S. and puppet troops has plummeted even more.

	The commentary said that the above situation further proves an indisputable fact: even if the United States sends 400,000, 500,000, or more troops to the South, it cannot reverse the situation. On the contrary, the more troops it sends, the less it finds a way out. Whether in strategy or tactics, it finds no way out.

	The commentary concluded that the military and people of South Vietnam will certainly achieve greater victories. The U.S. second "dry season offensive" plan will end in an even more disastrous failure than the previous dry season.

    消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服
    南越解放军一口一口吃掉美军
    最近在中部高原又歼美军两个连三个排
    美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。
    新华社河内二十三日电　据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方昆嵩省军民十九日全歼美国侵略军两个连。
    战斗发生在波来吉浪西北约二十八公里的沙太河畔。十九日中午，美国第二十五步兵师的两连军队在飞机大炮的掩护下进犯波来吉浪西北面地区。解放武装力量英勇机智地给来犯的敌人以迎头痛击，全部、彻底、干净地消灭了敌人。敌军增援部队也被吓得害怕遭到同样的命运，慌忙撤走。
    这样，从十月二十六日到十一月十九日，昆嵩省解放武装力量在嘉莱省解放武装力量的紧密配合下，接连在波来吉浪西北和沙太河东部和西部全歼美国步兵一个整营和六个连、两个炮兵连和一个迫击炮排；击毁大炮和迫击炮十七门；全歼伪军别动队四个连，打落敌机四架，缴获大量武器和作战物资。
    新华社二十三日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放军二十一日在中部高原波来古市附近全歼美国侵略军三个排。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国第一空中骑兵师的三个排在靠近柬埔寨附近的地方遭到解放军的沉重打击。幸存的美国兵承认，“这三个排中几乎每个人都被打死或打伤”。
    另据报道，西宁的战斗在继续进行，美国第二十五步兵师一个旅的指挥所，二十二日遭到解放军炮火的猛烈袭击。此外，南越伪军司令部承认，在同一天，解放军还进攻了距西贡西南一百二十多公里的一个伪军据点，守军遭到严重伤亡。
    新华社河内二十日电　越南南方解放电台最近发表评论指出，越南南方军民在十一月份上半月接连取得的辉煌战绩，是对美国侵略者的第二个“旱季反攻”计划的迎头痛击。
    评论指出，到目前，美国向越南南方派遣了三十五万多名军队，但它还是手忙脚乱，无法应付。美国军队东奔西跑，可是到头来，仍然未能逃脱在西原区、中部中区和南部东区遭到应有的惩罚。
    评论说，美伪集团在军事上的悲惨失败，使它们的政治局面更加混乱，美军和伪军的士气更加严重低落。
    评论说，上述情况更加证明了这样一个不可辩驳的事实：即使美国向南方增派四十万、五十万或更多的军队，它也不能扭转局势。相反，它越增兵，就越找不到出路。无论是在战略上，还是在战术上，都找不到出路。
    评论最后指出，越南南方军民必将取得更大的胜利。美国的第二个“旱季反攻”计划，必将以比前一个旱季更为惨重的失败而告终。
