	The Free Barber Shop
	He Yongdu, Militiaman of Lianhe Brigade, Hele Township, Wuxi City

	I learned a bit of barbering when I was young. Every time I saw community members wasting work time to get a haircut, I thought: if I could give them haircuts, wouldn't this both reduce lost work time and save community members' expenses? But then I thought: no, this way I'd have less rest, and it would also cause a lot of trouble. Never mind!

	Once, the team organized us to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "We should all learn from his spirit of selflessness.... A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a person of high moral character, a person of purity, a person of integrity, a person who has cast off vulgar pursuits, a person of benefit to the people." I thought: Comrade Bethune was a foreigner, and for the sake of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, he even risked his life; but I am not even willing to sacrifice a bit of my rest time to give community members haircuts, this is truly a big difference. Chairman Mao calls on us to learn from Comrade Bethune, so I should act according to Chairman Mao's words. The next day, I found a few barbering tools, and bought a few more with my own money, piecing together a makeshift "free barber shop" at home. From then on, no matter who came to the door, whether adult or child, I never said "no." Sometimes when it was windy or raining, I would proactively go to community members' homes to give them haircuts; during busy farming seasons, I would bring my barbering tools to the fields, no matter how tired I was, I never complained, never stopped.

	Through this experience, I realized: serving the people cannot have even a hint of selfishness, to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve everyone, one must "completely" and "thoroughly" eliminate selfishness. In a word, one must have a single-minded devotion to everyone, to the collective!

    “义务理发店”
    无锡市河埒公社联合大队民兵　何永度
    我小时候学过几天理发。每当看到社员因为理发耽误了上工时间，心里就想：要是自己能为社员们理理发，这不是既减少了误工，又节约了社员的开支吗？可是再一想：不行，这样自己少休息不算，而且还会增加不少麻烦。干脆算了吧！
    有一次，队里组织我们学习《纪念白求恩》。毛主席说：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。……一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”我想：白求恩同志是个外国人，为了中国人民的革命事业，连生命都不顾；而我却连牺牲一点休息时间，为社员理理发都不愿意，这真差得太远了。毛主席叫我们向白求恩同志学习，我就应该照着毛主席的话去做。于是，第二天我就找出几件理发工具，又用自己的钱添了几件，拼拼凑凑，在家里开了个“义务理发店”。从此，全队不管大人小孩，只要一上门，我从没有说个“不”字。有时刮风下雨，我就主动上门给社员理发；农忙时，我把理发工具带到田头，不管多累，从不叫苦，从不间断。
    通过这件事，我体会到：为人民服务，不能有半点私心，要“完全”、“彻底”为大家服务，就要“完全”、“彻底”破除私心，一句话，就是要一个心眼里想着大家，想着集体！
