He had a cordial conversation with them.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the State Council, extended warm greetings and a warm welcome to the glorious students returning to their motherland. He praised our students in the Soviet Union for their firm proletarian stance and tenacious fighting spirit in the struggle against modern revisionism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi encouraged them to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and to participate enthusiastically in the great proletarian cultural revolution. In the great waves of class struggle, they should temper themselves into staunch successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.
