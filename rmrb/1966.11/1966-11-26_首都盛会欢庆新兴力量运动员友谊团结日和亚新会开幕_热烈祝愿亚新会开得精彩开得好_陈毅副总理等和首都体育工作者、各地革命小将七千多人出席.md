Thousands of sports workers from the capital and revolutionary students and Red Guards from various regions gathered at the Beijing Gymnasium this evening to hold a grand meeting, celebrating the New Emerging Forces Athletics Friendship and Unity Day and the successful opening of the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games.

Vice Premier Chen Yi and other responsible officials from relevant departments attended the meeting.

A large portrait of Chairman Mao hung prominently in the center of the venue. Around the hall, large banners read: "Celebrate the New Emerging Forces Athletics Friendship and Unity Day!" "Celebrate the Opening of the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games!" "Resolutely Defend the Proletarian Revolutionary Line Represented by Chairman Mao!" "Resolutely Carry the Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the End!"

Before the meeting began, the 7,000 attendees, each holding a red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," collectively recited passages and sang "The East Is Red," fully demonstrating the deep love of the Chinese people and athletes for the great leader, Chairman Mao.

Wu Qinglu, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the State Sports Commission, spoke at the meeting. He said that the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games is not only a grand review of the sports achievements of the Asian people but also a grand demonstration of the Asian people's opposition to American imperialism. The people of Cambodia, with a glorious anti-imperialist tradition, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, have made outstanding contributions to the preparation and hosting of the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games. He, on behalf of Chinese athletes and sports workers, expressed gratitude to the Cambodian government and people, and to Prince Sihanouk.

Wu Qinglu pointed out that the development of the sports cause of the new emerging forces fully proves that unity against imperialism and independence and self-reliance are the only correct paths for the people of all countries to develop their sports. Only by resolutely opposing the interference, monopoly, and control of American imperialism, modern revisionism led by the Soviet Communist Party, and the reactionaries of various countries in international sports activities, can the people's sports cause be developed.

He concluded by saying, "Let us wish the First Asian New Emerging Forces Games, under the guidance of the spirit of enhancing friendship, mutual promotion, common development, and unity against imperialism, to be a great success and a spectacular event."

The New Emerging Forces Athletics Friendship and Unity Day was established at the second council meeting of the New Emerging Forces Games Federation held in Beijing in September 1965. The meeting declared November 25, the founding day of the New Emerging Forces Games Federation, as the New Emerging Forces Athletics Friendship and Unity Day.

The celebration meeting this evening was jointly organized by the Chinese National Committee of the New Emerging Forces Games, the State Sports Commission, and the All-China Sports Federation. Young Chinese table tennis and gymnastics athletes performed exciting table tennis and gymnastics routines at the meeting.

    首都盛会欢庆新兴力量运动员友谊团结日和亚新会开幕
    热烈祝愿亚新会开得精彩开得好
    陈毅副总理等和首都体育工作者、各地革命小将七千多人出席
    新华社二十五日讯　首都体育工作者和各地来京的革命师生和红卫兵七千多人，今晚在北京体育馆举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝新兴力量运动员友谊团结日和第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会胜利开幕。
    国务院副总理陈毅和各有关方面的负责人出席了大会。
    会场正中高挂着毛主席的巨幅画像。四周悬挂的大幅标语上写着：“庆祝新兴力量运动员友谊团结日！”“庆祝第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会开幕！”“坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！”“坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    大会开始前，全场七千多人个个手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》集体朗读，并且齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，充分显示了我国人民和运动员对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱。
    国家体委政治部副主任武清禄在会上讲了话。他说，第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会不仅是亚洲各国人民体育成就的一次大检阅，而且也是亚洲各国人民反对美帝国主义的一次大示威。具有光荣反帝传统的柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王的领导下，为筹备和主办第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会作出了杰出的贡献。他代表中国运动员和体育工作者向柬埔寨政府和人民，向西哈努克亲王表示感谢。
    武清禄指出，新兴力量体育事业的发展进程充分证明，团结反帝、独立自主，是世界各国人民发展体育事业的唯一正确的道路。只有坚决反对美帝国主义、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派对国际体育活动的干涉、垄断和控制，人民的体育事业才能得到发展。
    他最后说，让我们共同祝愿第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会在增进友好、互相促进、共同发展、团结反帝的精神指导下，开得好，开得精彩。
    新兴力量运动员友谊团结日，是一九六五年九月在北京召开的新运会联合会第二次理事会确定的。会议宣布把十一月二十五日——新运会联合会成立日，作为新兴力量运动员友谊团结日。
    今晚的庆祝大会是由中国新运会全国委员会、国家体委和中华全国体育总会主办的。我国年青的乒乓球和体操运动员，在会上分别进行了精彩的乒乓球和体操表演。
