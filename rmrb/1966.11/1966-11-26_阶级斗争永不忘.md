Those who do not understand oppression and exploitation do not understand revolution; those who do not know the bitterness and sweetness, hatred and love of the laboring people cannot distinguish who our enemies are and who our friends are. Many foreign friends, in order to familiarize themselves with and grasp this truth of revolution, despite the fatigue after labor, repeatedly visit poor and lower-middle peasants, asking them to tell their family histories and village histories, and to compare the old and new societies.

In a production brigade, after foreign friends listened to the family history of old poor peasant Zhao Grandpa, everyone spontaneously went to Zhao Grandpa's home. As soon as they entered the courtyard, a young man and woman came out to greet them. Zhao Grandpa pointed to the young man and introduced him to the guests, saying, "This is the son who nearly starved to death before liberation." Then he pointed to the young woman beside him and said, "This is my daughter-in-law."

The guests warmly congratulated them on gaining liberation and happiness under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The friends were deeply moved by the tremendous changes in Zhao Grandpa's home before and after liberation.

Pakistani friend Feiz Ahamed firmly shook Zhao Grandpa's hand and said, "Your home has changed so much! Without political liberation, such changes would be impossible. This is due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. I believe that your descendants will definitely remember the past sufferings and today's happiness forever."

One evening after dinner, Malaysian friend Sharada Salma and Austrian friend Zaili visited Li Wenxiu, a poor peasant who had once been a maidservant to a capitalist before liberation.

When Sharada learned about Li Wenxiu's tremendous changes before and after liberation, she excitedly said, "Chairman Mao not only brought happiness to the Chinese people but also showed the way to a bright future for workers and peasants all over the world. Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary teacher in the world, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time."

After listening to the old poor peasants' recollections of bitterness and sweetness, some foreign friends thought of their own countries and the many people suffering in the world from the two destinies of Chinese peasants in the old and new societies. Colombian friend Ailiviya deeply felt, "Here, when I see with my own eyes that Chinese peasants have shaken off their sufferings and are living a happy life, I think of my country's people and peasants who are now in extreme misery. I feel very sad. But we have the great thought of Mao Zedong, we have the revolutionary example of the Chinese people. The liberation struggle of my country's people against imperialism and domestic reactionary rule will definitely achieve victory."

The light in poor peasant Bi Youzhen's home was bright, and foreign friends and the Bi Youzhen family sat together as usual to chat. French friend Anna Banong and Belgian friend Lu Sairete Greichebei introduced the miserable lives of workers and peasants in France and Belgium. Bi Youzhen took Anna and Lu's hands and said:

"If the laboring people of the world do not seize power, everywhere they will be oppressed in the same way." Bi Youzhen's husband said:

"Since the Chinese people have been liberated and stood up, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, not forget the brothers and sisters in other countries who are still suffering, and we must do a good job in production to support the world revolution."

One day, foreign friends and community members picked bok choy together. The daughter of an American farmer, Kaiwen, and a few female community members talked about the lives of American farmers. Kaiwen leaned on the shoulders of the girls and said with confidence, "The miserable lives of American farmers will definitely come to an end, and the changes in China will definitely occur in the United States and other countries."

Several foreign experts from the United States, France, and Belgium who helped build our country participated in labor as ordinary community members.

### 阶级斗争永不忘

    阶级斗争永不忘
    不懂得压迫，不懂得剥削，就不懂得革命；不了解劳动人民的苦和甜、憎和爱，就不能分清谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友。许多外国朋友为了熟悉和掌握这个革命的真理，不顾劳动后的疲劳，一次又一次地访问贫下中农，请他们讲家史、村史，讲新旧社会的对比。
    在一个生产队里，外国朋友听了老贫农赵大爷的家史后，大家都不约而同地来到了赵大爷的家。刚一进院，一对男女青年迎了出来。赵大爷指着小伙子向客人们介绍说：“这就是我解放前差一点饿死了的儿子。”接着又指着身边的女青年说：“这是我的儿媳妇。”
    客人们热烈祝贺他们在毛主席和共产党领导下，获得了解放和幸福。朋友们看了赵大爷家解放前后的巨大变化，都非常激动。
    巴基斯坦朋友费兹·阿罕默德紧紧握着赵大爷的手说：“你的家变化太大了！如果没有政治上的解放，这种变化是不可能的。这是由于毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导。我相信，你们的后代一定会永远记住过去的痛苦和今天的幸福的。”
    一天晚饭后，马来亚朋友莎拉达·萨尔玛和奥地利朋友蔡尔尼，访问了在解放前曾给资本家当过丫头的贫农李文秀。
    当莎拉达知道李文秀解放前后的巨大变化时，就激动地说：“毛主席不仅给中国人民带来了幸福，而且也给全世界的工人和农民指出了光明前途。毛主席是全世界最伟大的革命导师，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。”
    听过老贫农的忆苦思甜，有些外国朋友从中国农民在新旧社会的两种命运中，想到了自己祖国和全世界许多正在受难的人民。哥伦比亚朋友艾黎维娅深有感触地说：“在这里，当我亲眼看到中国农民摆脱了苦难，过上了幸福生活的时候，我就想到我国人民和农民现在还处在极端痛苦的境地。我感到很痛心。但是，我们有了伟大的毛泽东思想，有了中国人民的革命榜样，我国人民反对帝国主义和国内反动统治的解放斗争，是一定会获得胜利的。”
    贫农毕有珍家里灯光雪亮，外国朋友和毕有珍一家，又像往日一样围在一起交谈起来。法国朋友安娜·巴农和比利时朋友吕赛特·葛莱希贝，介绍了法国和比利时工人、农民的悲惨生活。毕有珍拉着安娜和吕赛特的手说：
  “天下的劳动人民要是不掌权，到处都是一样地受压迫。”毕有珍的爱人说：
  “中国人民解放了，翻了身，我们一定遵照毛主席的教导，不忘记世界上其他国家还在受苦的兄弟姐妹，我们一定要把生产搞好，支援世界革命。”
    一天，外国朋友和社员们一起摘菠菜，美国农民的女儿克艾文和几个女社员谈起了美国菜农的生活。克艾文扶着姑娘们的肩膀，充满信心地说：“美国农民的苦难生活一定会结束，中国的变化一定会在美国和其他国家发生。”（附图片）
    几位来自美国、法国和比利时的帮助我国建设的外国专家，以普通社员的身份参加劳动。
