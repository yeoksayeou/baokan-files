I feel that a revolutionary should dedicate all his life and energy to the cause of human liberation—communism. I live only for one purpose: to be a person of use to the people.

		— Lei Feng

To engage in revolution, one must not fear sacrifice; fearing sacrifice means one cannot persist on the revolutionary path to the end, and thus there is no talk of revolutionary steadfastness. ... As long as it is truly necessary, when the time for sacrifice comes, a revolutionary thinks not of fear, but of striving to achieve greater victories.

		— Wang Jie

If it is necessary to sacrifice for the communist ideal, each one of us should and can do it—without changing expression or faltering.

		— Ou Yang Hai

Although a person's life is only one, the value of life is not as precious as the motherland. As long as I dedicate myself wholeheartedly to the motherland, to the people, and to the truth, even if I sacrifice my life and lose my youth, I will still feel proud and honored, and it will be a blessing.

		— Liu Yingjun

Fear of death means no revolution; engaging in revolution means no fear of death. As long as it is for the people, even if it means climbing a mountain of knives or entering a sea of fire, I will do so willingly.

		— Wang Ping, Martyr of the 32111 Hero Drilling Team

The purpose of war is primarily to annihilate the enemy, and secondarily to preserve oneself. The purpose of preserving oneself is to better annihilate the enemy. Sacrificing oneself for the people's interests is the most glorious.

		— Mai Xian De

I can only dedicate my entire life to the people and to the cause of communism. In my work, I will do more, do even more. For my comrades, I will do a good deed, do even more good deeds, until my last breath.

		— Wei Fengying

    学用警句
    我觉得一个革命者活着就应该把毕生精力和整个生命为人类解放事业——共产主义全部献出。我活着，只有一个目的，就是做一个对人民有用的人。
                        ——雷锋
    干革命就不能怕牺牲；怕牺牲就不能在革命的道路上坚持到底，就无所谓革命的坚定性。……只要真正需要，当牺牲的时候，革命者想到的不是害怕，而是努力以此来换得更大的胜利。
                        ——王杰
    如果需要为共产主义理想而牺牲，我们每一个人都应该也可以做到——脸不变色，心不跳！

    虽然人的生命只有一条，但是生命的宝贵比不上祖国更宝贵。只要我一心一意为了祖国，为了人民，为了真理，那怕牺牲了自己的生命，失去了自己的青春，我也感到骄傲和自豪，也是光荣的，也是幸福的。
                        ——刘英俊
    怕死就不革命，干革命就不怕死。只要为人民，那怕上刀山，进火海，我也心甘情愿。

                              王　平
    战争的目的，消灭敌人是最主要的，保存自己是第二位的，而保存自己的目的，也是为了更好地消灭敌人。为人民利益而牺牲自己是最光荣的。

    我只有为人民、为共产主义事业，献出一生的一切，在工作上，多做一点工作，再做一点工作，为同志们多做一件好事，再做一件好事，直到最后的一个活动。
                        ——尉凤英
