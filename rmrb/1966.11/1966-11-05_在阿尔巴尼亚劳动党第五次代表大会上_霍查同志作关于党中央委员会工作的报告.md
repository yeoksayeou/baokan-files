At the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha delivered a report on the work of the Party Central Committee.

On November 3, the New China News Agency reported from Tirana that Comrade Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, delivered a report on the work of the Party Central Committee at the Party's Fifth Congress on November 1.

Comrade Hoxha said in his report: Since the Fourth Congress to the present, this period has been the most difficult but also the most glorious in the 25-year history of our Party. During this period, a fierce, principled, and life-and-death struggle was waged against the shameful betrayal of the revolution and socialist cause, against Khrushchev revisionism, and this struggle has been recorded in history. In this struggle, our Party and people emerged victorious, while the modern revisionist enemies of the Albanian people and communism suffered a fatal defeat.

The Party and the people, united as one, smashed the arrogant attacks, blockade, and evil plots of the American imperialists and the Khrushchev-Tito revisionists, overcame the various difficulties and obstacles they created with selfless spirit, bravely defended the people's revolutionary victories, and successfully completed the basic tasks set by the Fourth Congress, pushing the socialist construction of Albania to a new stage of victory.

The Party welcomes its Congress with the magnificent task of firmly completing the new five-year plan, continuously advancing Albania's socialist cause, and, as always, with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other a gun, this is the symbol of our country's victorious revolution.

(I) International Situation and the Foreign Policy of Socialist Albania

The balance of international forces has changed and will continue to change. These changes are favorable to the revolutionary forces fighting for national and social liberation, for the establishment of a new world without capitalism and colonialism; they are unfavorable to imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism. Imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism are on the decline, fragmented, riddled with contradictions, besieged by the peoples of all countries, and constantly suffering blows from them. The tide of struggle by the peoples of all countries is rising day by day.

American imperialism is the common, cunning, and vicious enemy of the peoples of the whole world. Opposing this enemy is the lofty international task of all revolutionary forces today. Without resolutely fighting against American imperialism and smashing its plans of plunder and conspiracy, it is impossible to win and defend peace, freedom, independence, and socialism. The attitude towards American imperialism is the touchstone for all political forces in the world, the dividing line between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists.

The aggressive, warmongering, oppressive, and plundering behavior of American imperialism, as well as its weakness and unsolvable contradictions, show that the peoples of all countries can and should wage an unrelenting struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, fearing neither imperialism nor its nuclear blackmail, daring to defy imperialist power, daring to rise up in struggle, and being filled with unshakable confidence in the ultimate victory of their just cause.

The struggle against imperialism, for the victory of the just cause of the peoples of all countries, and the process of the world revolution are not, and cannot be, developed on a straight path. Revolutionaries do not become disheartened and lay down their arms because of temporary setbacks. On the contrary, revolutionaries draw useful lessons from them, prepare and brew future victories, and continue to push forward the revolution and anti-imperialist struggle within the country and internationally. As long as capitalism and imperialism, which exploit and oppress the workers and peoples of all countries, exist, the rise of revolutionary high tides is inevitable, and the victory of the revolution is unavoidable. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again... till their doom—this is the logic of the imperialists and all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the people's cause... Organize struggle, fail, organize struggle again, fail again... till their doom—this is the logic of the people, and they too will not avoid it. This is a Marxist law."

Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the current centers of revolutionary storms. These places strike heavy and direct blows at imperialism. The Albanian people welcome and fully support the just struggle of the peoples of these regions against imperialism and colonialist slavery, and regard this struggle as having great historical significance for the fate of the world revolution and socialism.

The Soviet revisionist leaders have formed a "holy alliance" with the greatest enemy of the peoples of the world, American imperialism. Soviet-American friendship and comprehensive cooperation are one of the basic features of the current international situation. The Soviet leadership sacrifices and is always ready to sacrifice the vital interests of the peoples and socialism of all countries. It not only abandons all effective struggles against imperialism but also plays the shameful role of extinguishing all people's liberation struggles.

The policy of not opposing imperialism and reactionaries, of surrendering to them and colluding with them, emboldens imperialism, enabling it to intensify its aggressive activities, to gather pro-imperialist reactionary forces everywhere, thereby exacerbating the international situation in recent years.

Comrade Hoxha then exposed and criticized the deceptive and dangerous nature of Khrushchev revisionism's policies of "peaceful coexistence," "complete and thorough disarmament," and "peaceful transition."

Comrade Hoxha said: Our Party and government have exposed and will continue to vigorously expose the conspiracies of the imperialists and revisionists behind the endless negotiations on disarmament. When the imperialists and revisionists not only do not want to disarm but continue to arm themselves with the most modern weapons, the freedom-loving peoples and socialist countries have only one way out: to arm themselves, not to let imperialism tie their hands, and to defend themselves from imperialist aggression. We congratulate the successful nuclear explosion and missile test of the People's Republic of China. This is a great victory. It has made the peoples of the world happy, strengthened the cause of peace, and thoroughly shattered the imperialist and revisionist nuclear monopoly.

The struggle against imperialism headed by the United States is inseparable from the struggle against modern revisionism headed by the Soviet leaders. Without exposing and opposing the deception and betrayal of revisionism, it is impossible to defeat imperialism and advance the world revolution.

The Vietnam War has become the focus of the current international situation. The Vietnamese people are waging a life-and-death struggle against the common enemy of all peoples of the world. The attitude towards this struggle is the touchstone for all political forces and parties. The Soviet leaders are playing a double game over the heads of the Vietnamese people: verbally opposing the American aggression on Vietnam and loudly proclaiming their certain "aid" to Vietnam; on the other hand, they are allowing the imperialist aggressors to continue to burn and kill the Vietnamese people, expanding their barbaric aggression against the Vietnamese people.

To cover up their betrayal, the Khrushchev revisionists talk a lot about so-called unity and solidarity on the Vietnam issue. But when the Soviet leaders take joint action with the American imperialists against Vietnam and the revolution, what unity and solidarity can there be between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists on the Vietnam issue? What are those who echo the lies of revisionism and those who pursue "united action" on the Vietnam issue seeking? Do they want us Marxist-Leninists and socialist countries to act in unison with the American imperialists like the Khrushchev revisionists and become their accomplices in opposing the Vietnamese people? No, this will never happen.

We are fully convinced that neither armed aggression nor revisionist deception, nor the "olive branch" of imperialism, can conquer and deceive the fraternal Vietnamese people.

The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people is a great inspiration to the peoples and international proletariat of all countries and has become a shining example of striking at imperialism, fighting against imperialism, and defeating imperialism. The Party of Labour of Albania, the Albanian people, and the government resolutely stand with the fraternal Vietnamese people, opposing the savage American aggressors, and fully supporting them.

The Central Committee reported to the Congress that, in accordance with the agreement reached with the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam will establish a permanent representative office in Tirana. Our Party and government congratulate this major event and believe it is a contribution to further strengthening the friendship and fighting unity between the Albanian people and the heroic people of South Vietnam.

Comrade Hoxha said: The developments in the international situation in recent years have convincingly proven that American imperialism is directing its global strategy against the socialist power that raises the banner of revolution and opposes imperialism—the People's Republic of China. American imperialism is doing everything it can to contain and isolate People's China, to disrupt and hinder its progress on the road of revolution and socialist construction, to encircle it with a network of fire, and to prepare for a "full-scale" war against it. The strategic plan of the United States is to maintain temporary peace in Europe and wage war in Asia; to maintain temporary peace with the Soviet Union and wage war against China. The Khrushchev revisionists not only completely cater to this strategy but also compete with their American partners in implementing it.

However, all the hostile activities of American imperialism, the reactionary forces of various countries, and the Khrushchev traitor clique against the great People's Republic of China have already suffered and will forever suffer a thorough defeat in the face of the invincible economic, political, military, and spiritual power of the 700 million Chinese people, who are united as one under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Today, supporting People's China, defending it from the aggression of the imperialists and their revisionist lackeys, is the historic task and a matter of life and death for all revolutionary and freedom-loving forces and peoples. Our people, our Party, and our government will march forward with the great people of China and the Communist Party of China on the common road of revolution, whether in peaceful times or in stormy weather, and will always stand shoulder to shoulder with them in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, for the victory of the revolution and socialism.

In the great life-and-death struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and all its lackeys, the People's Republic of China and the glorious Communist Party of China play a decisive role. Today, People's China is an unshakable fortress of socialism and the world revolution, a powerful and loyal pillar of the liberation and revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. It is a great and indomitable fighter against American imperialism, an insurmountable obstacle to the imperialist and revisionist plans for world hegemony, and an invincible Marxist-Leninist banner-bearer against revisionist betrayal.

Comrade Hoxha said: The People's Republic of Albania, under the leadership of the Party of Labour, has always and will always consistently pursue a revolutionary foreign policy based on Marxism-Leninism; it pursues a friendly policy towards the peoples of all large and small countries of the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit; it opposes imperialism headed by the United States, actively supports all countries and peoples struggling for freedom, democracy, and social progress, and actively supports the peoples of all countries and all revolutionary forces struggling to defend peace and achieve the victory of socialism. Today, Albania is stronger than ever, it has many loyal friends, and it enjoys great and well-deserved international prestige.

In its relations with socialist brother countries, the Party and government have always adhered to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, which are the only correct and inviolable basis for these relations. The relations with the People's Republic of China are a shining example of the correctness and power of these principles. In recent years, the close revolutionary friendship and comprehensive relations between Albania and China have developed greatly and fruitfully. The Albanian people feel honored and proud that, whether in good times or difficult times, they have the fraternal Chinese people and the People's Republic of China as such loyal and steadfast friends and comrades-in-arms. Our Party and government warmly congratulate the great victories achieved by the People's Republic of China at home and abroad, and regard them as our own victories; we firmly support its right to liberate Taiwan and other Chinese islands from American occupation, and support the principled revolutionary foreign policy of the People's Republic of China. Our people and our Party will continue to defend and strengthen the great fighting friendship between Albania and China, for the benefit of our people and the great communist cause. The Party of Labour of Albania will continue to hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, the banner of revolution and proletarian internationalism.

(II) Completion of the Third Five-Year Plan and Main Directions for Economic and Cultural Development in the Next Five Years

To complete the tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan, the Party and the people have worked and struggled under the difficult conditions created by the Khrushchev revisionist traitor leadership and their lackeys. Under the wise, far-sighted, and courageous leadership of the Party, due to the revolutionary enthusiasm and high patriotism of the working masses, socialist Albania has advanced, smashed the blockade, and waged a tit-for-tat struggle with the revisionists and imperialists, and, as always, achieved victory.

Comrade Hoxha said in discussing the achievements of the Third Five-Year Plan: Compared to the Second Five-Year Plan, investment increased by 43 percent, construction volume increased by 67 percent, 430 new industrial, agricultural, and socio-cultural projects were completed and put into production. The total industrial output value increased by 39 percent compared to 1960. The total agricultural output value increased by 36 percent compared to 1960. National income increased by 44 percent compared to the Second Five-Year Plan. Cultural education and health care have also developed significantly and continuously.

The achievements of economic and cultural development during the five-year plan period most convincingly prove the correctness of the Party's line in socialist construction.

During the years of our Party and people's heroic struggle to complete the tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan, we have better understood our true friends and enemies. In these years, our true allies, genuine revolutionaries, and comrades-in-arms—the great Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong—stood by our side. The People's Republic of China, when it was in difficulty and had to overcome the serious difficulties caused by natural disasters and the blockade of the Khrushchev revisionists, American imperialism, and all reactionaries, gave us internationalist, fraternal, and selfless aid. This was of great significance for the completion of the tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan, the smashing of the economic blockade, and the strengthening of national defense forces.

Allow me to express our deep gratitude on this solemn platform of the Congress to the fraternal Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong for the immeasurable aid they have given and are giving us in the socialist construction of our country.

Comrade Hoxha said in discussing the main directions and tasks of socialist construction during the new five-year plan period from 1966 to 1970:

The basic task of the Party's general line for building a socialist society, which was in the past and remains now, is: to continuously develop the productive forces and, on this basis, to improve the welfare of the people; to perfect the socialist relations of production on the correct revolutionary path; to deepen the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural spheres; to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and the unity of the people with the Party; to wage fierce and irreconcilable class struggle against domestic and foreign enemies and all alien influences, to strengthen national defense forces. At the same time, the Party adheres to the line of gradually narrowing the differences between the working class and the peasantry, between the cities and the countryside, between industry and agriculture, and between mental and physical labor.

Based on this general line, during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary to ensure the further development of our productive forces to accelerate the establishment of the material and technical base of socialism.

The total industrial output value in 1970 will be 50 to 54 percent higher than in 1965.

The total agricultural output value during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period will be 41 to 46 percent higher than during the Third Five-Year Plan. The basic task of agriculture during this period is, first of all, to increase the production of grain, potatoes, rice, and edible oil.

The total investment for the Fourth Five-Year Plan is expected to be approximately 34 percent higher than the previous five-year plan.

The national income in 1970 will be 45 to 50 percent higher than in 1965.

Comrade Hoxha discussed several major issues in the development of the economy during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period. They are: (1) Continuing the national industrialization remains one of the urgent tasks of socialist construction; (2) Developing agriculture is the most important link in completing the main economic tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan; (3) Increasing accumulation and using it most effectively; (4) Improving the welfare of the people, combining personal interests with collective interests, and current interests with long-term interests; (5) Further strengthening economic management on the basis of democratic centralism.

Comrade Hoxha said: Our Party adheres to the principle that: each socialist country should first rely on its own strength, on the wealth and resources of the country, to build a developed economy with a strong industry and advanced agriculture, to ensure the independence of the country and its continuous development on the socialist path.

The line that our Party adheres to is: we should not only have a developed industry but also an advanced agriculture; to make our economy a strong and independent one, we must walk on two legs. We must rely on both industry and agriculture. Without the rapid development of agriculture, it is unthinkable to improve the national economy more quickly. During the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, agriculture will play a leading role in the overall development of the national economy.

Increasing grain production is a basic task of agriculture and the entire national economy. Therefore, the struggle for self-sufficiency in grain has always been and will continue to be a struggle for socialism. Under the banner of "Struggle for Grain Self-Sufficiency," the peasant laborers have achieved very good results this year. Although the planned grain output is higher than any other year, the task has been successfully completed. The experience of this year is very encouraging, and the task of increasing grain production proposed by the Fourth Five-Year Plan will definitely be completed.

During the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, the Party will, as always, firmly implement the correct revolutionary line of self-reliant socialist construction.

To further implement democratic centralism in economic leadership, to strictly adhere to the principle of emphasizing politics and the mass line, the Party has taken important steps to expand the powers and roles of various levels of state and economic organs, to further strengthen democracy in economic management, and to eliminate bureaucratism in economic management.

The Party has always paid attention to the fact that, whether in the form of remuneration or in the measures of remuneration, it should conform to the socialist principle of distribution according to labor, to raise the socialist consciousness and communist education of the working people, and to correctly combine personal interests with collective interests, spiritual encouragement with material rewards. Therefore, the Party's measures to reduce high wages to prevent the phenomenon of extravagant living and the formation of a privileged class are of great significance and special meaning in this regard.

The achievements in the first year of the new five-year plan are encouraging and are a reliable guarantee for the successful completion of the tasks of the five-year plan in the coming years. The people have been mobilized as never before, and everywhere there is an unprecedented enthusiasm for labor.

The Central Committee is convinced that, united as one, our Communist Party members and the entire people, inspired by the great ideal of the Party and the bright prospects shown by the Fourth Five-Year Plan, will always advance on the correct path of building socialism according to Marxism-Leninism, making the motherland stronger, richer, and more civilized.

(III) Further Strengthening the Party and Its Leadership Role

Comrade Hoxha said: The historical experience of our Party has proven the Leninist idea that: without a revolutionary party of the working class, without a party that is loyal to Marxism-Leninism, without an organized party that can lead and guide the working masses in struggle and labor, the proletariat cannot defeat the bourgeoisie, build socialism, and communism.

Throughout its life, our Party has strictly adhered to the basic ideological, political, and organizational principles of Marxism-Leninism. In general, our Party has correctly implemented these principles according to the conditions and development of the situation, and has adopted new, more revolutionary ways of working. This has made our Party a lively, fighting party, always linked with the people, and the leader who inspires, guides, and educates the working masses to struggle, overcome difficulties, and achieve victory. In the future, we should continue to pay great attention and be wholeheartedly concerned with constantly tempering our Party, developing and strengthening the fighting revolutionary spirit of the Party, and strengthening its leadership role in all aspects of socialist construction.

The Central Committee of our Party has continuously taken a series of major historical measures aimed at further revolutionizing the entire life of the state, with the aim of advancing and deepening the socialist revolution in the political, economic, ideological, and cultural spheres, thoroughly smashing any basis for the spread of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, strengthening national defense forces, ensuring the victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction for this generation and future generations, making our country prosperous and progressive, and forever holding high the banner of socialism and Marxism-Leninism.

These revolutionary measures have been warmly welcomed and fully supported by all workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and intellectuals, because they have once again seen the correctness of the Party's line, the strength and revolutionary steadfastness of the Party, and understood that these measures are for the benefit of the people, the motherland, and the socialist cause.

These measures have caused a great response among all our friends—the Communist Party of China, the Marxist-Leninist parties and forces of various countries, and all revolutionaries. They regard these measures as the creative application of Marxism-Leninism under our conditions, as a contribution to the common revolutionary cause of the proletariat.

Comrade Hoxha then discussed four issues: continuously improving the composition and distribution of the Party, maintaining the purity of the Party's ranks; enhancing the leadership role of grassroots Party organizations and further activating the internal life of the Party; improving the Party's work with mass organizations and further implementing the mass line; rooting out bureaucratism and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Comrade Hoxha said: Our Party has 66,327 members, of whom 3,314 are probationary members. The total number of members has increased by 12,668 compared to the Fourth Congress. This is an important sign of the close ties between the Party and the working masses, indicating that the working masses enthusiastically support our Party's correct line.

In the future, Party organizations should continue to adhere to this main policy: the majority of those admitted to the Party should come from the production sector, from the working class and laboring peasants. At the same time, more attention should be paid to the work of recruiting Party members from the ranks of women and our brave youth.

The Party needs new blood, but it needs pure blood. What we need first and foremost is a Party that is strong in quality. Therefore, we should not pursue quantity.

Revolution and socialism are the cause of the people under the leadership of the communists. The successful completion of the tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the further advancement of comprehensive socialist construction, the defense of the socialist motherland from foreign enemy aggression, the maintenance of our socialist system to prevent it from degenerating into capitalism and revisionism, the prevention of the restoration of capitalism—all these depend on the political and ideological awareness of the people, on their socialist consciousness and their activism in all aspects.

In all its activities, our Party has always and will always adhere to the principle of "learning from the masses first, then educating the masses."

The task of the Party is to correctly and consistently implement the principle of "from the masses, to the masses," making it the working method of all Party organizations, state organs, economic organs, mass organizations, and all Communist Party members and cadres working on all fronts of socialist construction.

One of the most important issues we face is to temper the younger generation with revolutionary and class spirit, to strengthen the work of the Youth League. This is a major issue related to the fate of our revolution and socialist cause in the future. We must never forget that the communist education of the younger generation is carried out in the context of acute class struggle at home and abroad, especially in the complex and great ideological struggle. We should not overlook the fact that today's youth do not know the cruel class oppression and exploitation, nor do they know the sacrifices made to achieve the current situation. They have grown up in a relatively peaceful environment and have not been tempered in the school of life and productive labor. On the other hand, the influence of bourgeois and revisionist ideas, through various means, often in very cunning and indirect ways such as literature, film, music, and fashion, is infiltrating our youth.

The Party should help the youth to understand the past well, to draw revolutionary lessons from it. The youth should be engaged in various major activities, allowing them to be tempered in the school of labor and life.

The attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat is one of the most vital issues in the development of socialism.

To prevent our people's power from being threatened by the danger of degeneration into revisionism and capitalism, to strengthen the Party and the people's main weapon for building a socialist and communist society—the people's power, the Party has recently taken a series of major measures. Their purpose is, on the one hand, to root out the bureaucratic evil winds in state organs, to further effectively promote and expand the socialist democracy of the broad masses of the people; on the other hand, to further strengthen the national defense of the socialist motherland and strengthen the organs of struggle against the enemy.

One of the main issues that Party organs and organizations should grasp in their working methods in correctly leading state organs is to fundamentally improve the political and ideological work that the Party does among the people and cadres, to explain the tasks to them, to make them clear about the future and the path forward, to check and assist in the completion of the set tasks.

(IV) Further Deepening the Ideological and Cultural Revolution

Without further deepening the ideological and cultural revolution, it is impossible to talk about the further revolutionization of national life. Revolutionization is carried out on the basis of the ideological and cultural revolution.

Comrade Hoxha said in discussing the issue of struggling for the victory of socialist ideology, which is struggling for the victory of socialism and communism:

In our country, proletarian socialist ideology is the dominant ideology. However, we are aware that this struggle is long-term and arduous.

As long as the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural sphere does not achieve complete victory, the victory of the socialist revolution in the political and economic spheres is not guaranteed. Therefore, the struggle to thoroughly eliminate bourgeois and revisionist ideology in the ideological sphere is ultimately a matter of whether to build socialism and communism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, or to open the door wide for the spread of bourgeois and revisionist ideology and return to capitalism.

Whether to acknowledge or not to acknowledge the class struggle in socialist society is a principle issue, a dividing line between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists, between revolutionaries and traitors to the revolution. Any abandonment of class struggle will have fatal consequences for the fate of socialism. Therefore, while struggling to increase production and develop culture and education, while struggling against foreign enemies—imperialists and revisionists—we must not abandon and forget the class struggle at home. Otherwise, history will punish us.

The task of the Party is not to close our eyes to this inevitability, not to numb the revolutionary vigilance of communists and the masses, but to vigorously and unshakably wage this class struggle until the final victory. Without class struggle, it is impossible to understand and achieve the progress of our society and the revolutionary education of the working people.

In practice, we often encounter narrow views on class struggle and class enemies, seeing only the former exploiting class members or foreign imperialists and Tito, Khrushchev revisionists as class enemies, seeing only their anti-socialist activities as class struggle. The struggle against these enemies will always be our Party, state, and Albanian working people's primary task. However, we should have a broader understanding of class struggle. This is a comprehensive struggle, and currently, it is first and foremost an ideological struggle, a struggle to occupy people's minds and souls, a struggle against the corruption of bourgeois and revisionist ideas, against the remnants and phenomena that exist to a greater or lesser extent in all of us, a struggle for the victory of our communist ideology and spirit.

The primary task of all the Party's ideological work is to make communists and all workers establish a correct understanding of class struggle in our country, to educate them with an irreconcilable class struggle spirit, to make them master the only method of correctly recognizing and solving all problems—the method of class analysis, to educate them not only to acknowledge the necessity of class struggle in words but to wage class struggle in every domain of life every day.

The Party's ideological work should make us clear about the nature of the contradictions in socialist society and the correct ways to resolve these contradictions. Comrade Mao Zedong said, in socialist society, "There are two types of social contradictions, namely, the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions among the people. These are completely different types of contradictions." "The former is the question of distinguishing between the enemy and us, the latter is the question of distinguishing between right and wrong."

Any phenomenon that confuses these two types of contradictions is an error that leads to opportunism or sectarianism.

Another very important aspect of the Party's ideological work is to conduct education on the new socialist attitude towards labor.

Cadres, communists, and every worker should live like revolutionaries, struggle hard, sacrifice first, and enjoy later.

Comrade Hoxha said in discussing the two issues of further developing and deepening the revolutionary spirit of people's culture and education, thoroughly improving the methods and style of educational work:

Now, new tasks have been proposed in the development of socialist culture. The tasks proposed by the Party are: literature and art should become a powerful weapon for the Party to educate workers with socialist and communist spirit; literature and art should struggle to cultivate youth who are pure in thought and morality; the entire artistic creation should have a high ideological level, should permeate the revolutionary fighting spirit of the Party and the healthy national spirit. The Party requires literature and art to widely reflect the struggle, labor, and life of the working people, their ideals and aspirations, noble feelings, heroic characters, simplicity and greatness, revolutionary enthusiasm; to truly reflect the objective reality of our country and its revolutionary development; the center of creation should be the heroes of our time—workers, peasants, soldiers, people's intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, as well as the youth educated by the Party, who are selflessly and bravely laboring and struggling to build socialism, defend, and prosper the socialist motherland; cultural and artistic organs should always be guided by the Party's political and ideological requirements, oppose and expose bourgeois ideology, so that literature and art have a revolutionary and educational influence on the masses, and make literature and art come from the people and serve the people.

Only when writers and artists strive to master Marxism-Leninism, not only through books but also by implementing the Party's line and reflecting the Party's line in their literary works; only when they maintain a high degree of ideological vigilance in the struggle against the influence and views of bourgeois and revisionist ideas from abroad, in defending the ideological purity of our entire creation; only when they are closely linked with the people and their labor, struggle, and life, and regard this link as the decisive factor in their creation, these tasks can be accomplished.

Our Party firmly adheres to the Leninist principle of proletarian party spirit in the fields of art, culture, and the entire spiritual life of society. Just as in other aspects, in this field, the struggle between Marxist-Leninist materialist thought and feudal, bourgeois idealist thought is also fierce. The decaying bourgeois culture and art are incompatible with socialism, we oppose it and abandon it, everything that is progressive, democratic, and revolutionary from the perspective of proletarian thought, we value it and use it.

To better adapt to the major task of educating and tempering the younger generation, we must further revolutionize our education and schools. This revolutionization should be comprehensive, including the educational system itself, the content of teaching and education, and the methods of teaching and education.

Comrade Hoxha said: The Party should spare no effort to activate creative thought in the field of Marxist social sciences, propaganda work, and the entire ideological and cultural work.

The revolutionization of the entire content and style of ideological work and its close connection with life should first help our Party members and all workers to grasp Marxism-Leninism more deeply and consciously. Grasping Marxist-Leninist thought and turning it into a daily weapon of struggle for our workers is a basic feature of the further deepening of the ideological and cultural revolution process in our country.

The historical task of the Party is to rely on the masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and intellectuals, to guide them to actively participate in creative revolutionary activities, to continuously deepen the ideological and cultural revolution, and to carry this revolution through to the end.

(V) The Party of Labour of Albania's Struggle Against Modern Revisionism and the Defense of the Purity of Marxism-Leninism

During the period from the Fourth Congress to this Congress, our Party has waged a resolute and principled struggle to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, waging a tit-for-tat struggle against the Khrushchev, Tito revisionists, and their followers.

I. Modern Revisionism—The Product and Ally of the Bourgeoisie and Imperialism

The Party of Labour of Albania believes that waging an open struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership is one of the main tasks of all Marxist-Leninists, because modern revisionism is the main enemy of the international communist movement, its strategic goal is to preserve capitalist rule forever in places where capitalism rules; to restore capitalist rule in places where capitalist rule has been overthrown.

The history of the birth, development, and victory of Marxism-Leninism is the history of continuous struggle against all its ideological and political enemies, against traitors and splitters, against all kinds of opportunists and revisionists. In the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and opportunism and revisionism, victory always belongs to Marxism-Leninism. Every struggle against opportunism and revisionism has brought about great historical victories for the communist movement, and Marxism-Leninism has developed and risen to a higher stage.

In the history of the international communist movement, there has never been such a widespread and dangerous revisionism as Khrushchev's modern revisionism. Marxist-Leninists should not only be good at struggling against revisionism in power but also be good at preventing the Soviet revisionist tragedy from repeating itself in countries that are currently building socialism or will take the socialist road in the future.

II. The Strategic Goals of Khrushchev Revisionism

Revisionists direct their main spearhead against the reliable theory of the world revolution, against the elimination of imperialism and capitalism—Marxism-Leninism, and replace it with opportunist and counter-revolutionary theory serving the bourgeoisie and imperialism. The goal of the revisionists is to disarm the Party and the working class ideologically, to pave the way for the degeneration and betrayal of socialism and the international communist movement.

The second target of the revisionists' struggle is to corrupt and destroy Marxist-Leninist parties, turning them into social democratic parties to support counter-revolution, sabotage socialism, and restore capitalism.

Another goal of the Khrushchev revisionists is to degenerate the socialist system, abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the banner of the "people's state," the Khrushchev revisionists abolished the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union, establishing the dictatorship of their new bourgeois class.

The Khrushchev revisionists have always tried and are trying to destroy the greatest revolutionary achievement of the world working class and all laboring masses—the socialist camp, to sabotage the Marxist-Leninist fraternal relations between socialist countries, replacing them with hegemonic and chauvinistic relations, and the blackmail and pressure of big countries over small countries, strong countries over weak countries in the economy, politics, and military.

In the international arena, destroying the internationalism of the workers, sabotaging the international communist movement, making the communist parties of various countries subordinate to the Soviet revisionist leadership, this also occupies an important position in the strategy of the Khrushchev revisionists. The Soviet leadership group does not direct its entire struggle against the bourgeoisie, against the enemies of the working class, but against the Marxist-Leninist parties, first of all, against the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania.

The essence of the Khrushchev revisionist line, their dream and highest ideal is Soviet-American friendship and cooperation, the establishment of a new alliance of American imperialism and Soviet revisionist imperialism to rule the world. The Khrushchev revisionists led by the Soviet leaders unite with imperialism, oppose socialism, unite with the United States, oppose the peoples of all countries, unite with all reactionaries, oppose revolutionaries, unite with the Tito clique and all traitors of the working class, oppose Marxism-Leninism, and oppose the parties and forces that are loyal to Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary cause.

III. The Struggle of the Party of Labour of Albania and All Marxist-Leninists Against Revisionism and Its Achievements

In the face of the great betrayal of Khrushchev revisionism, the glorious Communist Party of China, the Party of Labour of Albania, other Marxist-Leninist parties, and all true revolutionary communists have risen up, ordered revisionism to "stop," and begun a fierce, principled, and uncompromising struggle against revisionism.

This is a struggle to defend Marxism-Leninism and communism, a struggle to defend the vital interests of the working class and the peoples of all countries.

Our Party's fierce and unrelenting struggle against Khrushchev revisionism has been going on for more than six years. During these years, the high moral qualities and character of our Party: clarity of thought, the iron-like unity between the Party and the people, the revolutionary courage of the Party have once again been powerfully demonstrated. Our Party has adhered to the principle of principle, resolutely opposed modern revisionism, which has aroused the hatred of the enemy revisionists, and won the love and respect of our friends, all Marxist-Leninists, and revolutionaries around the world. We cherish this greatly, we will always be humble, and we will unshakably stand on the correct revolutionary position and make our contribution in the great struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism today.

The struggle against revisionism and the struggle against imperialism, in the past and now, have developed in waves and in a tortuous manner. However, the general trend of this struggle, in the past and now, is the continuous rise of the anti-revisionist tide and the Marxist-Leninist forces, and the continuous decline of the revisionist and anti-Marxist forces. Khrushchev revisionism is on the decline. Due to the open resistance and struggle against it, the revisionists have suffered heavy losses and fallen into a deep overall crisis.

What are the main achievements of this historic struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism?

First, the struggle of the Marxist-Leninist parties and forces has torn off all the masks of the Khrushchev revisionists, exposing their traitorous faces.

Second, now, the internal and external policies of the revisionists have completely failed. The Khrushchev revisionists have fallen into deep and irreconcilable contradictions with the communists and the people of the Soviet Union; they have fallen into total conflict with all anti-imperialist forces in the world.

Third, the revisionist front has been fundamentally shaken. They are like a pack of hungry wolves ready to devour each other at any moment. The baton can no longer direct the entire revisionist orchestra.

Fourth, now everyone can see that the revisionist group is weak, unstable, and in a shaky position. The weakness of the Soviet leadership group in all aspects is clearly shown in the shameful failure of its leader and propagandist, the number one traitor, Khrushchev. The successors of Khrushchev not only inherited Khrushchevism but also inherited all the unresolved problems left by Khrushchev. Their revisionist line continues to produce various difficulties and contradictions. These difficulties and contradictions are becoming more and more serious.

Fifth, due to the struggle of the Marxist-Leninist parties and forces, the counterattack against the revisionist line and methods, in the domestic and international arenas, various forces are undergoing a process of great division towards Marxism-Leninism or modern revisionism. In the world, including some socialist countries, dozens of new Marxist-Leninist parties and groups have been established. We heartily congratulate these Marxist-Leninist parties and groups, wishing them success in their just struggle for the great revolutionary ideal of the proletariat. The Party of Labour of Albania does not care about the slander and accusations of the revisionists that we are engaged in so-called "sectarian" and "splittist" activities. She has done and will do everything possible and with all her strength to support the new Marxist-Leninist forces and all those who oppose imperialism, oppose revisionism, and advocate revolution. We regard this as our sacred internationalist duty. Because we believe that the growth and development of these new revolutionary forces is the only correct way to achieve the victory of Marxism-Leninism and crush revisionism.

From the results of the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism so far, it can be clearly seen that revisionism has fallen into a crisis with no way out, and the final defeat of revisionism is inevitable. Like all true revolutionaries, our Party's task is to further strengthen the defense of the Marxist-Leninist position and the struggle to expose revisionism.

IV. Strengthening the Struggle Against Khrushchev and Tito Modern Revisionism

Further developing and strengthening the struggle against revisionism is linked to resolutely refuting the illusions of so-called changes, transformations, and corrections of the errors of N. Khrushchev by the new Soviet leadership. These illusions are very harmful. Marxist-Leninists will not be deceived by superficial phenomena or the deceptive propaganda of the new Soviet leadership at any cost. The current Soviet leaders have not changed and do not want to change; they are determined to continue down the path of betrayal. Therefore, it is absolutely not possible to expect any transformation from the revisionist traitors.

Those who have illusions about the so-called "changes" and "transformations" of the new Soviet leadership have they seen these "changes" and "transformations"? If they are not deceived by Khrushchev-style deception and fall unconsciously into its trap, then they have not seen any specific "changes" and "transformations." It should be admitted that in deception, the new Soviet leadership is more cunning and more skillful than their teacher. They swear allegiance to Leninism with their mouths and allow a "more objective" evaluation of Stalin, but at the same time, they swear allegiance to the 20th, 21st, and 22nd Congresses of the Soviet Communist Party. Is this a "transformation"?

The new Soviet revisionist leaders shout about the "unity" of the "big family" of the communist movement and socialist countries, but at the same time, they declare that on any principle issue of foreign policy and the international communist movement, they have no differences with N. Khrushchev. Are these words also so-called "transformations"? Absolutely not.

The Soviet revisionists loudly proclaim anti-imperialist "joint action." Many facts show that the Khrushchev revisionists only oppose imperialism in words, but in action, they are pro-imperialist.

The anti-imperialist front of the peoples of the world should be established on a healthy basis. It should be a true anti-imperialist front. In this front, all forces that effectively oppose imperialism headed by the United States in one way or another should be united. The Khrushchev revisionists, with their entire policy and actions, have placed themselves outside the anti-imperialist front. In reality, cooperating with the revisionists, engaging in "joint action" with them, means gradually sliding to the position of revisionism, accepting their line of betrayal.

We believe that it is time to draw a clear line with modern revisionists, especially with the Soviet leadership group, and to wage the most fierce struggle to isolate the Soviet leadership group among the communists and revolutionary communists of the Soviet Union.

As in all other issues, in the struggle against modern revisionism, the only correct position is the principled position. Principles cannot be traded, the struggle to defend principles cannot be half-hearted, and a wavering and opportunist position should absolutely not be taken. The struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism is a manifestation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism. In this struggle, there is no middle ground. Whoever takes this line in their attitude towards the traitors of Marxism-Leninism will sooner or later have the danger of sliding to the position of traitors.

Our Party believes that the sharp and realistic issue on the agenda today is not to reconcile and unite with the revisionists but to completely separate and break away from them. Facing the united front of imperialism and revisionism and their attacks, conspiracies, and war threats, Marxist-Leninists should strengthen their unity within the country and internationally, and strengthen the struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

The glorious Communist Party of China, led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, and the great People's Republic of China are firmly and unshakably standing in the forefront of the current struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism headed by the Soviet leadership group. This is an undeniable historical fact, a great fortune for the peoples of all countries and the international communist movement. The role and contribution of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China in the struggle for the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the peoples of the world are enormous. The Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China are today an indestructible fortress of socialism, a strong revolutionary base, the banner-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, the steel pillar and reliable rear guard of our common revolutionary cause.

The imperialists and revisionists are trying to destroy the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China because the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China are their strongest enemies, an insurmountable obstacle to their plans to conquer and rule the world. They are trying to isolate the Communist Party of China from the peoples, revolutionaries, and Marxist-Leninists of all countries, to isolate it and easily destroy us. World imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism are attacking People's China together, slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China. The enemy's attempt to defame the great People's China is in vain. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the great People's China is advancing to victory. The Party of Labour of Albania welcomes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China aims to mercilessly oppose the bourgeois and revisionist ideas that exist in people's minds, in the cultural sphere, and in all aspects of state life, to oppose the class enemies and all open and hidden revisionist elements who try to drag People's China onto the capitalist road, to oppose American imperialism, Khrushchev revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

The Party of Labour of Albania believes that all Marxist-Leninist parties and forces in an equal and independent position should unite closely with the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China and build an iron wall that makes all our enemies bleed.

The Party of Labour of Albania, as an active member of the world Marxist-Leninist forces, is fully aware that today the communist movement faces the great historical task of defending Marxism-Leninism, advancing the revolutionary and socialist cause. In the future, the Party of Labour of Albania will, as always, stand shoulder to shoulder with the great Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong and all Marxist-Leninist parties and forces in the world, resolutely opposing imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism headed by the Soviet leadership group, fully supporting the just revolutionary struggles of the Marxist-Leninist parties and forces, and making tireless efforts to strengthen the unity of the Marxist-Leninist movement in the anti-revisionist struggle and the unity of the peoples of the world in the anti-imperialist struggle. She believes that victory will belong to Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and the peoples of all countries.

    在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上
    霍查同志作关于党中央委员会工作的报告
    新华社地拉那三日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志，一日在党的第五次代表大会上作了关于党中央委员会工作的报告。
    霍查同志在报告中说：自第四次代表大会到现在这个时期，是我党二十五年生活中最困难，但也是最光荣的时期。这个时期，进行了激烈的、原则性的、你死我活的斗争，反对对革命和社会主义事业的可耻背叛，反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义，并以此而载入史册。在这场斗争中，我党和人民赢得了胜利，而阿尔巴尼亚人民的和共产主义的凶恶敌人现代修正主义者却遭到了致命的失败。
    党和人民团结一致，粉碎了美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫、铁托修正主义者的猖狂进攻、封锁和罪恶阴谋，以忘我的精神克服了他们制造的各种困难和障碍，英勇地捍卫了人民的革命胜利，顺利地完成了第四次代表大会所规定的基本任务，把阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设事业推向一个新的胜利阶段。
    党以坚定地完成新的五年计划的宏伟任务来迎接自己的代表大会，不断地推进阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义事业，和以往一样，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，这是我国胜利的革命象征。
    （一）国际形势和社会主义阿尔巴尼亚的对外政策
    国际力量的对比已经发生了变化，并将继续不断地发生变化。这些变化有利于为民族和社会解放、为建立没有资本主义和殖民主义的新世界而斗争的革命力量；不利于帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义。帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义日薄西山，四分五裂，矛盾重重，内外交困，陷于各国人民的包围之中，并不断遭到他们的打击。各国人民的斗争浪潮一天一天地高涨。
    美帝国主义是全世界人民的凶恶、阴险的共同大敌。反对这一敌人是当代一切革命力量的崇高的国际任务。不同美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，不粉碎美帝国主义的掠夺计划和阴谋，就不可能赢得和捍卫和平、自由、独立和社会主义。对美帝国主义的态度是对全世界一切政治力量的试金石，是马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者的分界线。
    美帝国主义的侵略成性、好战、压迫和掠夺他人的野蛮行为及其虚弱性和无法解决的矛盾表明，各国人民能够而且应该同以美帝为首的帝国主义进行无情的斗争，不怕帝国主义和它的核讹诈，敢于蔑视帝国主义的力量，敢于起来斗争并对自己正义事业的最后胜利充满不可动摇的信心。
    反对帝国主义、争取各国人民正义事业胜利的斗争和世界革命的进程，不是、也不可能是在笔直的道路上发展的。革命者不为暂时的挫折而气馁和放下武器。相反，革命者从中吸取有益的教训，准备和酝酿未来的胜利，继续不断地把国内和国际范围的革命和反帝斗争推向前进。只要剥削和压迫各国劳动者和人民的资本主义和帝国主义存在，革命高潮的兴起就不可阻挡，革命的胜利就不可避免。毛泽东同志说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。……斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是马克思主义的又一条定律。”
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲是当前革命大风暴的中心。这些地方给帝国主义以沉重和直接的打击。阿尔巴尼亚人民欢迎和全力支持这些地区的人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义奴役的正义斗争，并把这个斗争看作是对世界革命和社会主义的命运具有重大历史意义的斗争。
    苏联修正主义领导人同全世界各国人民的最大敌人美帝国主义结成了“神圣同盟”。苏美友好和全面合作是当前国际形势的基本特点之一。苏联领导牺牲了并随时准备牺牲各国人民和社会主义的切身利益。它不仅自己放弃了各种有效的反对帝国主义的斗争，而且扮演着扑灭一切人民解放斗争的可耻角色。
    不反对帝国主义和反动派、在它们面前投降和同它们进行勾结的修正主义背叛政策，助长了帝国主义的气焰，使它能够加紧进行侵略活动，到处纠集亲帝国主义的反动势力，从而加剧了这几年的国际局势。
    霍查同志接着揭露和批判了赫鲁晓夫修正主义的“和平共处”、“全面彻底裁军”和“和平过渡”政策，指出这些政策的欺骗性和危险性。
    霍查同志说：我们党和政府揭露了、并将继续大力地揭露帝国主义者和修正主义者在关于裁军的无休止的谈判幕后，策划反对各国人民和社会主义的阴谋。当帝国主义者和修正主义者不仅不想裁军，反而用最现代化的武器继续武装自己的时候，爱好自由的各国人民和社会主义国家只有一条出路，即武装起来，不让帝国主义束缚自己的手脚，并保卫自己不受帝国主义侵略。我们祝贺中华人民共和国的核爆炸和发射导弹核武器试验成功，这是一个伟大胜利。它使世界各国人民高兴，巩固了和平事业，并彻底粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义的核垄断。
    反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争同反对以苏联领导人为首的现代修正主义的斗争是不可分割的。不揭露和不反对修正主义的欺骗性和背叛，就不能胜利地反对帝国主义和推进世界革命。
    越南战争已经成了当前国际形势的焦点。越南人民正在同全世界各国人民的共同敌人进行着一场你死我活的斗争。对待这场斗争的态度是对一切政治力量和政党的试金石。苏联领导人在越南人民头上玩弄两面把戏：在口头上反对美国侵略越南，并大肆喧嚷其对越南的某些“援助”；而另一方面则放手让帝国主义侵略者不断地烧杀越南人民，扩大对越南人民的野蛮侵略。
    为了掩盖背叛活动，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在越南问题上大谈所谓团结一致。但是，当苏联领导人同美帝国主义者采取反对越南和反对革命的联合行动时，马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者在越南问题上又有什么团结一致可谈呢？修正主义者和那些附和修正主义者的谎言，在越南问题上搞“统一行动”的人追求些什么呢？难道要我们马克思列宁主义者和社会主义国家像赫鲁晓夫修正主义者那样同美帝国主义者联合行动，并成为他们反对越南人民的帮凶吗？不，这永远办不到。
    我们完全相信，无论是武装侵略还是修正主义的欺骗，或者帝国主义的“橄榄枝”，都不能征服和欺骗兄弟的越南人民。
    越南人民的英勇斗争，是对各国人民和国际无产阶级的巨大鼓舞，并成了打击帝国主义、同帝国主义斗争和打败帝国主义的光辉榜样。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民和政府坚决同兄弟的越南人民站在一起，反对野蛮的美国侵略者，并全力地支持他们。
    党中央向代表大会报告，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会根据同阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府达成的协议，将在地拉那设立常驻代表处。我国党和政府祝贺这一重大事件，认为这是对进一步加强阿尔巴尼亚人民和英雄的越南南方人民之间的友谊和战斗团结的一个贡献。
    霍查同志说：近几年来，国际形势的发展令人信服地证明，美帝国主义把它的全球战略指向高举革命和反对帝国主义的旗帜的社会主义强国——中华人民共和国。美帝国主义千方百计地企图遏制和孤立人民中国，破坏和阻挡她在革命和社会主义建设道路上前进，用火力网包围她，并准备发动一场反对她的“全面”战争。美国的战略计划是在欧洲暂时保持和平，在亚洲进行战争；同苏联暂时保持和平，对中国进行战争。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不仅完全迎合了这一战略，而且在推行这一战略方面同它的美国伙伴展开了竞赛。
    但是，美帝国主义、各国反动势力和赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团反对伟大的中华人民共和国的所有这一切敌对活动，在万众一心地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党周围的七亿中国人民的不可摧毁的经济、政治、军事和精神力量面前，已经遭到、并将永远遭到彻底的失败。
    今天，支持人民中国、保卫她免受帝国主义者及其走狗修正主义者的侵犯，是一切革命的和爱好自由的力量和人民的历史性任务和生死攸关的问题。我国人民、我们党和政府同伟大的中国人民和中国共产党在共同的革命道路上前进，无论在和平的日子里，还是在暴风雨的时刻，都将永远同他们肩并肩地站在一起，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义、争取革命和社会主义胜利的斗争中共同前进。
    在决定人类命运的各国人民同帝国主义及其一切走狗的伟大的殊死斗争中，中华人民共和国和光荣的中国共产党起着决定性的作用。今天，人民中国是社会主义和世界革命的坚不可摧的堡垒，是各国人民及其解放和革命斗争的强大的和忠实的支柱。她是反对美帝国主义的伟大的和不屈不挠的战士，是帝国主义和修正主义实行世界霸权计划的不可逾越的障碍，是反对修正主义背叛的战无不胜的马克思列宁主义旗手。
    霍查同志说：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在劳动党领导下，过去和将来都始终不渝地奉行建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的革命的外交政策；根据平等互利的原则对世界大小国家人民奉行友好的政策；反对以美国为首的帝国主义，积极支持为争取自由、民主和社会进步而斗争的所有国家和人民，并积极支持为保卫和平、争取社会主义胜利而斗争的各国人民和一切革命力量。今天，阿尔巴尼亚比任何时候都更加强大，她有许多忠实的朋友，并享有巨大的和当之无愧的国际威望。
    在她同社会主义兄弟国家的关系中，党和政府一贯遵循马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则，这是这种关系的唯一正确和不可侵犯的基础。同中华人民共和国的关系是这些原则的正确性和威力的光辉范例。近几年来，阿尔巴尼亚和中国之间亲密的革命友谊和全面的关系得到了巨大的和卓有成效的发展。阿尔巴尼亚人民感到光荣和自豪的是，无论在美好的日子里还是在困难的日子里，有兄弟的中国人民和中华人民共和国作自己的这样忠实和坚定的朋友和战友。我们党和政府热烈祝贺中华人民共和国在国内和国际范围取得的伟大胜利，并像对待自己的胜利一样感到高兴；坚决支持她把台湾和中国其它岛屿从美国霸占下解放出来的权利，支持中华人民共和国的原则性的革命外交政策。我国人民和我们党将继续捍卫和加强阿中伟大的战斗友谊，以造福于我国人民和伟大的共产主义事业。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党今后仍将高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，高举革命和无产阶级国际主义旗帜。
    （二）第三个五年计划完成情况和今后五年内经济和文化发展的主要方向
    为了完成第三个五年计划的任务，党和人民在苏联修正主义叛徒领导及其走狗制造的困难条件下进行了工作和斗争。在党的英明的、卓有远见的和勇敢的领导下，由于劳动群众发挥了革命干劲和高度的爱国主义精神，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚前进了，粉碎了封锁，同修正主义者和帝国主义者进行了针锋相对的斗争，和以往一样取得了胜利。
    霍查同志在谈到完成第三个五年计划所取得的成果时说：
    与第二个五年计划相比，投资额增加了百分之四十三，建筑量增加了百分之六十七，建成了四百三十个工业、农业、社会文化等新项目并投入了生产。工业总产值与一九六○年相比增长了百分之三十九。农业总产值比一九六○年增长了百分之三十六。国民收入比第二个五年计划增长了百分之四十四。文化教育和卫生事业也有了显著的和持续不断的发展。
    五年计划期间经济和文化发展所取得的成果，最令人信服地证明了党在社会主义建设中所遵循的路线的正确性。
    我们党和我国人民在为完成第三个五年计划而进行英勇斗争的年代里，更好地认清了自己的真正朋友和敌人。在这些年代里，真实的盟友、真正的革命者和战友——伟大的中国人民和以毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党站在我国人民和我党一边。中华人民共和国在自己处于困难和不得不克服严重的自然灾害及赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、美帝国主义和一切反动派的封锁所造成的困难的时候，给了我们以国际主义的、兄弟般的和无私的援助。这对于完成第三个五年计划的任务、粉碎经济封锁和加强国防力量具有重大的意义。
    请允许我在这个代表大会的崇高的讲坛上，向兄弟的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席表示我们深切的感谢，感谢他们过去和现在在我国社会主义建设中所给予我们的不可估量的援助。
    霍查同志在谈到一九六六年——一九七○年新的五年计划期间社会主义建设的主要方向和任务时说：
    党的建成社会主义社会总路线的基本任务，过去是、现在仍然是：不断发展生产力，并在此基础上提高人民的福利；在正确的革命道路上，完善社会主义生产关系；深入开展思想和文化领域里的社会主义革命；加强无产阶级专政和人民同党的团结；同国内外敌人和各种格格不入的影响进行激烈的和不可调和的阶级斗争，加强国防力量。与此同时，党遵循逐步缩小工人阶级和农民，城市和乡村，工业和农业以及体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别的路线。
    根据这条总路线，在第四个五年计划期间，应该保证我国生产力的进一步发展，以加速建成社会主义的物质技术基础。
    一九七○年工业总产值将比一九六五年增长百分之五十至五十四左右。
    第四个五年计划期间，农业总产值将比第三个五年计划增长百分之四十一至四十六。这个时期农业的基本任务，首先是增加粮食、土豆、大米和食用油的生产。
    第四个五年计划的投资总额预计比上一个五年计划大约增加百分之三十四。
    一九七○年的国民收入将比一九六五年增加百分之四十五到五十。
    霍查同志谈到了第四个五年计划期间发展经济的几个主要问题。它们是：（1）继续进行国家工业化仍然是社会主义建设的迫切任务之一；（2）发展农业是完成第四个五年计划主要经济任务的最主要的环节；
  （3）增加积累和最有效地使用积累；（4）提高人民的福利，个人利益与集体利益、当前利益与长远利益相结合；（5）在民主集中制的基础上进一步加强经济管理。
    霍查同志说：我们党坚持这样的原则，即：每个社会主义国家首先应该依靠自己的力量，依靠国内的财富和资源建立一个具有强大工业和先进农业的发达的经济，以保证国家的独立和在社会主义道路上不断发展。
    我们党所遵循的路线是：我们不仅应该有一个发达的工业，而且应该有一个先进的农业；为了使我国经济成为强大独立的经济，必须两条腿走路。既依靠工业，也依靠农业。没有农业的迅速发展，更快地改善国民经济状况就不能设想。在第四个五年计划期间，农业在整个国民经济发展中占主要地位。
    增加粮食生产是农业和整个国民经济的基本任务。因此，为粮食自给而斗争，过去和现在都始终是为社会主义而斗争。在“争取粮食自给”口号的鼓舞下，今年劳动农民取得了很好的成果。尽管粮食的计划产量比任何一年都高，但是，任务是胜利地完成了。今年的经验是十分鼓舞人心的，而第四个五年计划所提出的增产粮食的任务一定能够完成。
    第四个五年计划期间，党将一如既往地坚决执行自力更生建设社会主义的革命的正确方针。
    为了进一步贯彻在经济领导方面的民主集中制，严格坚持突出政治和群众路线，党采取了重要步骤以扩大各级国家机关和经济机关的权力和作用，进一步加强经济管理中的民主，消灭经济管理中的官僚主义。
    党一向注意到，无论是报酬形式，还是报酬的措施，都要符合社会主义的按劳分配的原则，要提高劳动人民的社会主义觉悟和共产主义教育，正确地把个人利益和集体利益、精神鼓励和物质奖励结合起来。因此，在这个问题上，党为了防止出现生活的铺张现象和形成特权阶层而采取的降低高工资的措施是具有重要意义和特殊含义的。
    在新的五年计划的头一年中所取得的成果是令人鼓舞的，是胜利地完成五年计划今后几年任务的可靠保证。人民都空前动员起来了，到处呈现出一片空前未有的劳动热情。
    中央委员会深信，我国共产党人和全体人民团结一致，在党的伟大理想和第四个五年计划所展示的光辉前景的鼓舞下，将永远在马克思列宁主义的建设社会主义的正确道路上前进，把祖国建设得更加强大、更加富强和更加文明。
    （三）进一步加强党和党的领导作用
    霍查同志说：我们党的历史经验证明了列宁主义的这样一种思想，即：没有一个工人阶级的革命党，没有一个忠于马克思列宁主义的党，没有一个能够在斗争和劳动中领导和指导劳动群众的有组织的党，那么，无产阶级要战胜资产阶级，建设社会主义和共产主义是不可能的。
    我们党在她的整个生活中严格地忠实于马克思列宁主义的基本的思想、政治和组织原则。总的说来，我们党根据条件和发展的形势，并采取了新的、越来越革命的工作方式方法，正确地贯彻了这些原则。这使我们党变成一个生气勃勃的、战斗的党，使她永远同人民联系在一起，并成为鼓舞、指导和教育劳动群众进行斗争、克服困难、取得胜利的领导者。今后，我们仍然应该最大地关心和一心一意地重视不断锻炼我们党，发扬和加强党的战斗的革命精神，加强她在社会主义建设各个环节上的领导作用。
    我们党中央委员会不断采取了一系列旨在使整个国家生活进一步革命化的具有重大历史意义的措施，其目的在于在政治、经济、思想和文化各条战线上推进和深入开展社会主义革命，彻底粉碎散布修正主义和复辟资本主义的任何基础，加强国防力量，保证这一代和后代胜利地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，使我国繁荣和进步，永远高举社会主义和马克思列宁主义的旗帜。
    这些革命措施受到了全体劳动者，工人、农民、战士、干部和知识分子的热烈欢迎和完全拥护，因为他们从这些措施中再一次看到了党的路线的正确性，看到了党的力量和革命坚定性，懂得了这些措施都是为了人民、祖国和社会主义事业的利益。
    这些措施引起了我们所有的朋友——中国共产党、各国马克思列宁主义政党和力量以及全体革命者的很大反响。他们把这些措施看作是马克思列宁主义在我国条件下的创造性运用，是对无产阶级的共同革命事业所作的贡献。
    霍查同志随后论述了四个问题，它们是：不断改善党的成分和分布情况，维护党的队伍的纯洁性；提高基层党组织的领导作用和进一步活跃党的内部生活；改进党对群众组织的工作和进一步深入贯彻群众路线；根除官僚主义和巩固无产阶级专政。
    霍查同志说：我们党有六万六千三百二十七名党员，其中三千三百一十四人是预备党员。党员总数比第四次代表大会增加了一万二千六百六十八人。这是党和劳动群众密切联系的重要标志，它表明劳动群众热烈拥护我们党的正确路线。
    今后，党组织仍应该贯彻这个主要方针：被接收入党的多数人应来自生产部门，来自工人阶级和劳动农民。同时，应该更加重视从妇女和我国英勇青年的队伍中吸收党员的工作。
    党需要新的血液，但需要的是纯洁的血液。我们要的首先应该是在质量上坚强的党，因此不应该追求数量。
    革命和社会主义是在共产党人领导下的人民群众自己的事业。成功地实现第四个五年计划的任务，进一步进行全面的社会主义建设，保卫社会主义祖国不受外来敌人的侵犯，维护我们的社会主义制度，使之不蜕化变质为资本主义和修正主义，不出现资本主义复辟，这一切都取决于人民群众的政治思想觉悟程度，取决于他们的社会主义觉悟和他们在各方面的积极性。
    我们党在整个活动中过去和现在都一贯坚持“先向群众学习，然后再教育群众”的原则。
    党的任务就是要正确地、始终不渝地贯彻“从群众中来，到群众中去”的原则，使它成为所有党组织、国家机关、经济机关、群众组织以及在社会主义建设各个战线上工作的全体共产党员和干部的工作方法。
    我们面临的一个最重大的问题是以革命的、阶级的精神来锻炼青年一代，加强青年联盟的工作。这是关系到我国革命事业和社会主义事业今后的命运的重大问题。我们任何时候都不能忘记，对青年一代的共产主义教育是在国内外尖锐的阶级斗争，特别是在复杂的、巨大的思想斗争的情况下进行的。不应该忽视，今天的青年不了解残酷的阶级压迫和剥削，也不了解为了争取今天的局面所作出的牺牲，他们生长在比较和平的环境中，没有在生活和生产劳动的学校中经受过锻炼。另一方面，资产阶级和修正主义的思想影响，通过种种方式，往往是通过文学、电影、音乐和时装等十分狡猾和间接的方式向我国青年进行渗透。
    党要使青年很好地了解过去，帮助青年从中吸取革命教益。应该使青年投入到各项重大的活动中去，让他们在劳动和生活的学校里受到锻炼。
    对待无产阶级专政的态度问题，是社会主义发展的最切身攸关的问题之一。
    为了使我国人民政权不受到向修正主义和资本主义蜕化变质的危险，为了加强党和人民为建成社会主义和共产主义社会的主要武器——人民政权，党最近采取了一系列重大措施。它们的目的一方面是要根除在国家机关中的官僚主义的歪风邪气，进一步有效地发扬和扩大广大人民群众的社会主义民主；另一方面，要进一步巩固社会主义祖国的国防和加强对敌斗争机关。
    党的机关和组织在正确领导国家机关时的工作方法中应该抓住的主要问题之一，是根本改进党在人民和干部中所进行的政治思想工作，向他们讲明任务，使他们明确前途和前进的道路，检查和协助完成既定的任务。
    （四）进一步深入开展思想文化革命
    不进一步深入开展思想文化革命就谈不上国家生活的进一步革命化。革命化就是在思想文化革命的基础上进行的。
    霍查同志在谈到为社会主义思想胜利而斗争就是为社会主义和共产主义的胜利而斗争的问题时说：
    在我们这里，无产阶级社会主义思想是占统治地位的思想。但是，我们意识到，这方面的斗争是长期而艰巨的。
    只要思想文化领域里的社会主义革命不获全胜，那么，政治和经济领域里的社会主义革命胜利也就没有保证。因此，在思想战线上彻底消灭资产阶级和修正主义思想的斗争，归根到底关系到：是建设社会主义和共产主义，防止资本主义复辟，还是为散布资产阶级和修正主义思想大开方便之门，重新回到资本主义的问题。
    承认还是不承认社会主义社会的阶级斗争，是一个原则问题，是马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者、革命者和革命的叛徒之间的分界线。任何放弃阶级斗争的表现都会给社会主义的命运带来致命的后果。所以，在进行增加生产、发展文化教育的斗争的同时，在同国外敌人——帝国主义者和修正主义者进行斗争的同时，绝不应该放弃和忘记国内的阶级斗争。否则，历史将严惩我们。
    党的任务不是在这一必然性面前闭起眼睛，不是麻痹共产党员和群众的革命警惕性，而是大力地和毫不动摇地进行这场阶级斗争，直到取得最后胜利为止。离开了阶级斗争就无法理解、也不能实现我国社会的进步和劳动人民的革命教育。
    我们在实践中往往会遇到对阶级斗争和对阶级敌人的狭隘的观点，仅仅把过去的剥削阶级分子或者国外的帝国主义者和铁托、赫鲁晓夫修正主义者看作是阶级敌人，仅仅把他们的反社会主义活动看作是阶级斗争。同这些敌人进行斗争永远是我们党、国家和我国劳动人民的首要的任务。但是，我们应该更广义地来理解阶级斗争。这是一场全面的斗争，当前它首先是一场思想斗争，是一场占领人们头脑和灵魂的斗争，是一场反对资产阶级和修正主义的腐蚀、反对在我们所有人身上或多或少地保存和表现的格格不入的残余和现象的斗争，是一场争取我们共产主义思想和精神胜利的斗争。
    党的全部思想工作中的首要任务是使共产党员和全体劳动者树立对我国阶级斗争的正确观念，以不调和的阶级斗争精神教育他们，使他们掌握正确认识和解决所有问题的唯一的方法——阶级分析的方法，教育他们不仅在口头上承认阶级斗争的必要，而且要在生活的每个领域里天天进行阶级斗争。
    党的思想工作应该使我们明确社会主义社会矛盾的性质和正确解决这些矛盾的途径。毛泽东同志说，在社会主义社会中，“有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”“前者是分清敌我的问题，后者是分清是非的问题。”
    任何混淆这两类矛盾的现象都是导致机会主义或宗派主义的错误。
    党的思想工作另一个十分重要方面是进行新的社会主义劳动态度的教育。
    干部、共产党员、每个劳动者都应该像革命者一样生活，艰苦奋斗，牺牲在前，享受在后。
    霍查同志在谈到发扬和加深人民文化教育的革命精神、彻底改进教育工作方法和作风这两个问题时说：
    现在，在发展社会主义文化方面提出了新的任务。党提出的任务是：文学和艺术应该成为党以社会主义和共产主义精神教育劳动者的有力武器；文学和艺术应该为培养在思想和道德上纯洁的青年而斗争；整个艺术创作应该具有高度的思想水平，应该贯串党的革命的战斗精神以及健康的民族精神，党要求文学和艺术广泛地反映劳动人民的斗争、劳动和生活、他们的理想和愿望、高尚的感情、英雄的性格、朴实和伟大、革命的热情；真实地反映我国的客观现实及其革命的发展；创作的中心应该是我们时代的英雄——工人、农民、战士、人民知识分子和革命干部以及党教育出来的青年人，他们为建设社会主义、保卫和繁荣社会主义的祖国在忘我地和英勇地劳动和斗争；文化和艺术机关任何时候都应该以党的政治思想要求为指导，反对和揭露资产阶级思想，以便使文学和艺术在群众中发生有教育意义的革命影响，并使文学和艺术来自于人民，为人民服务。
    只有当作家和艺术家努力掌握马克思列宁主义，不仅通过书本，而且通过执行党的路线和在自己的文艺作品中反映党的路线来学习马克思列宁主义；只有当他们在反对资产阶级和修正主义的外来影响和观点，保卫我们整个创作的思想纯洁性的斗争中保持高度的思想警惕；只有当他们同人民及其劳动、斗争和生活紧密地联系起来并把这种联系看作是自己创作的决定性因素的时候，这些任务才能完成。
    我们党坚决遵循艺术、文化和整个社会精神生活领域内无产阶级党性的列宁主义原则。就像在其他方面一样，在这个领域里马克思列宁主义唯物思想和封建主义、资产阶级唯心思想之间也在进行着一场激烈的阶级斗争。没落的资产阶级文化艺术同社会主义是格格不入的，我们反对它和抛弃它，一切从无产阶级思想的批判眼光来看是进步的、民主的和革命的东西，我们就重视它和利用它。
    为了更好地适应我们面临的教育和锻炼年青一代的重大任务，必须使我们的教育和学校进一步革命化。这种革命化应该是全面的，它包括教育制度本身、教学和教育工作的内容以及教学和教育的方法。
    霍查同志说：党应该全力以赴地活跃马克思主义社会科学领域、宣传工作以及整个思想和文化工作中的创造性思想。
    整个思想工作及其内容和作风的革命化以及它同生活的密切联系，首先应该有助于我国党员和全体劳动者更深刻和更自觉地掌握马克思列宁主义。掌握马克思列宁主义思想并把它变为我国劳动者的日常斗争的武器，是标志我国思想文化革命过程进一步深入的基本特点。
    党的历史任务是依靠工人、农民、战士、干部和知识分子群众，引导他们积极参加创造性的革命活动，不断深入开展思想和文化革命并把这场革命进行到底。
    （五）阿尔巴尼亚劳动党反对现代修正主义、保卫马克思列宁主义纯洁性的斗争
    从第四次代表大会到这次代表大会这一期间，我们党为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性进行了坚决的和原则性的斗争，同赫鲁晓夫、铁托修正主义分子及其追随者进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    一、现代修正主义——资产阶级与帝国主义的产物和同盟者
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党认为，同以苏联修正主义领导为中心的现代修正主义不断进行公开的斗争是所有马克思列宁主义者的主要任务之一，因为现代修正主义是国际共产主义运动的主要敌人，它的战略目的是要在资本主义统治的地方，永远保存资本主义统治；在资本主义统治被推翻了的地方，恢复资本主义统治。
    马克思列宁主义产生、发展和胜利的历史，就是同它的一切思想上和政治上的敌人，同叛徒和分裂者，同形形色色的机会主义者和修正主义者不断进行斗争的历史。在马克思列宁主义同机会主义和修正主义的斗争中，胜利永远属于马克思列宁主义。每经过一场反对机会主义和修正主义的斗争，共产主义运动就取得历史性的伟大胜利，马克思列宁主义就得到了发展并提高到一个更高的阶段。
    在国际共产主义运动历史上，从来没有出现过像赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义散布得这样广和危险性这样大的修正主义。马克思列宁主义者不仅应该善于同掌权的修正主义作斗争，而且还应该善于防止苏联的修正主义悲剧在当前建设社会主义的国家或今后将要走上社会主义道路的国家里重演。
    二、赫鲁晓夫修正主义的战略目的
    修正主义者把他们斗争的主要矛头指向关于世界革命、关于消灭帝国主义和资本主义的可靠的理论——马克思列宁主义，并代之以为资产阶级和帝国主义服务的机会主义的和反革命的理论。修正主义者的目的就是要解除党和工人阶级的思想武装，以便为实现社会主义和国际共产主义运动的蜕化变质开辟道路。
    修正主义者的第二个斗争目标是腐蚀和消灭马克思列宁主义政党，把它们变成社会民主党，以支持反革命，破坏社会主义，维护和复辟资本主义。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的另一个目标是使社会主义制度蜕化变质，取消无产阶级专政。在“全民国家”的幌子下，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在苏联取消了无产阶级专政，建立了他们新兴资产阶级阶层的专政。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者过去和现在都企图消灭世界工人阶级和全体劳动群众的最伟大的革命成果社会主义阵营，企图破坏社会主义国家之间马克思列宁主义的兄弟关系，代之以霸权和沙文主义的关系，以及大国对小国、强国对弱国进行的讹诈，在经济、政治和军事上施加的压力。
    在国际范围内破坏工人的国际主义团结，破坏国际共产主义运动，使各国共产党屈从苏联修正主义领导，这在赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的战略中也占着一个重要的位置。苏联领导集团不是把整个斗争矛头指向资产阶级，指向工人阶级的敌人，而是指向马克思列宁主义政党，首先指向中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的实质，他们的美梦和最高理想是苏美友好和合作，是建立美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的帝国主义主宰世界的新同盟。以苏联领导人为首的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者联合帝国主义，反对社会主义，联合美国，反对各国人民，联合一切反动派，反对革命者，联合铁托集团和工人阶级的一切叛徒，反对马克思列宁主义以及忠于马克思列宁主义和革命事业的政党和力量。
    三、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和所有马克思列宁主义者反对修正主义的斗争及其成果
    在赫鲁晓夫修正主义的大背叛面前，光荣的中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、其它马克思列宁主义政党和所有真正革命的共产党人奋起，喝令修正主义“住手”，开始了一场激烈的、原则性的和毫不妥协的反对修正主义的斗争。
    这是一场捍卫马克思列宁主义和共产主义的斗争，是捍卫工人阶级和各国人民的切身利益的斗争。
    我们党反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的激烈、不断的斗争已进行了六年多了。在这几年中，我们党的高尚素质和品德：思想明确性，党的队伍、党和人民间的钢铁般的团结，党的革命勇敢精神又一次有力地表现出来。我们党坚持原则立场，坚决反对现代修正主义，引起了敌人修正主义者的仇视，赢得了我们的朋友、全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命者的热爱和尊敬。我们十分珍贵这一点，我们要永远谦虚，毫不动摇地站在正确的革命立场上，在当前马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间所进行的伟大斗争中作出我们的贡献。
    反对修正主义的斗争和反对帝国主义的斗争，过去和现在都是波浪式地、曲折地发展着的。但是，这一斗争发展的总趋势，过去和现在都是反修浪潮和马克思列宁主义力量的不断高涨，修正主义和反马克思主义的力量不断下降。赫鲁晓夫修正主义在走下坡路。由于对它的公开反抗和斗争，修正主义者遭受了重大的损失，陷入了深刻的总危机之中。
    马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间的这一历史性的斗争的主要成果是什么？
    第一，马克思列宁主义政党、马克思列宁主义力量的斗争扯下了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的一切假面具，暴露了他们的叛徒真面目。
    第二，现在，修正主义者的内外政策完全遭到了失败。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者陷入了同苏联共产党人、苏联人民的深刻的和不可调和的矛盾之中；陷入了同世界一切反帝力量的总冲突之中。
    第三，修正主义阵线已从根本上动摇。他们就像一群饿狼随时都可能互相吞噬。指挥棒已经不能再指挥整个修正主义乐队了。
    第四，现在大家都已看到，修正主义集团是虚弱的，不稳定的，地位是动摇的。苏联领导集团各方面的虚弱清楚地表现在它的头子和鼓吹者、头号大叛徒赫鲁晓夫的可耻的破产中。赫鲁晓夫的继承人不但继承了赫鲁晓夫主义，而且继承了赫鲁晓夫遗留下来的各种没有解决的问题，他们的修正主义方针不断产生各种困难和矛盾。这种困难和矛盾变得越来越严重。
    第五，由于马克思列宁主义政党、马克思列宁主义力量进行了斗争，对修正主义路线和方法进行了回击，在国内和国际范围，各种力量正经历着向马克思列宁主义或现代修正主义大分化的过程。在世界上，包括有些社会主义国家，建立了几十个马克思列宁主义新党和小组。我们向这些马克思列宁主义政党和小组表示衷心的祝贺，祝它们为工人阶级的伟大革命理想而进行的正义斗争取得成就。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，对修正主义者诬蔑和指责我们在进行所谓“宗派活动”和“分裂活动”这一点，毫不介意，她过去和将来都尽一切可能和力量来支持马克思列宁主义的新生力量和所有反对帝国主义、反对修正主义、主张革命的人们。我们把这看成是我们崇高的国际主义义务。因为我们认为，这些新生的革命力量的成长和发展是争取马克思列宁主义胜利和粉碎修正主义的唯一正确的道路。
    从马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间迄今所进行的斗争的上述结果，可以清楚地看到，修正主义已经陷入没有出路的深刻危机之中，修正主义的最后失败是不可避免的。和所有真正的革命者一样，我们党的任务是要更加加强捍卫马克思列宁主义阵地和揭露修正主义的斗争。
    四、加强反对赫鲁晓夫和铁托现代修正主义的斗争
    进一步发展和加强反对修正主义的斗争，同毫不犹豫地驳斥所谓苏联新领导人起了“变化”、有了“转变”、他们正在“改正”尼·赫鲁晓夫的错误等等幻想是联系在一起的。这种幻想是十分有害的。马克思列宁主义者不会被表面现象所迷惑，不会被苏联新领导人不惜代价地进行的欺骗宣传所迷惑。苏联现领导人根本没有变，也不想变，他们决心沿着背叛的道路走下去，因此，绝对不能指望修正主义叛徒会有任何转变。
    那些对苏联新领导人的所谓“变化”和“转变”抱有幻想的人是否看到了这种“变化”和“转变”呢？如果不是受到赫鲁晓夫式的欺骗，自觉不自觉地陷入了它的圈套的话，那么，他们就根本没有看到什么具体的“变化”和“转变”。应该承认，在欺骗这方面，苏联新领导人比他们的老师更为狡猾，手段更巧妙。他们口头上发誓忠于列宁主义，而且允许“更客观地”评价斯大林，但同时又发誓忠于苏联共产党第二十次、二十一次和二十二次代表大会。难道这是“转变”吗？
    苏联修正主义新领导人叫嚷共产主义运动和社会主义国家“大家庭”的“团结”，但同时又宣称在对外政策和国际共产主义运动的任何一个原则问题上，他们同尼·赫鲁晓夫没有任何分歧。难道这些话也是所谓的“转变”吗？绝对不是。
    苏联修正主义者大肆宣传反帝“联合行动”。许多事实说明，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者只是在口头上反帝，而在行动上是亲帝的。
    全世界人民的反帝战线应该建立在健康的基础上。它应该是真正的反帝战线。在这个战线中，应该团结一切以这种或那种方式有效地反对以美国为首的帝国主义的力量。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者以其全部政策和活动，把自己置于反帝战线之外。实际上，同修正主义者进行合作，同他们搞“联合行动”，就意味着自己逐渐滑到修正主义的立场上去，接受他们的背叛路线。
    我们认为，是同现代修正主义者，特别是同苏联领导集团划清界限的时候了，是进行最激烈的斗争使苏联领导集团在苏联人民和苏联革命的共产党人中间完全孤立的时候了。
    同在其它所有问题上一样，在反对现代修正主义的斗争中，唯一正确的立场是原则性的立场。不能拿原则作交易，维护原则的斗争不能半途而废，绝不应该采取动摇的和机会主义的立场。马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间的斗争是无产阶级和资产阶级之间、社会主义和资本主义之间的阶级斗争的表现。在这场斗争中，不可能有中间路线。谁在对马克思列宁主义的叛徒的态度上坚持这条路线，他迟早也会有滑到叛徒立场上去的危险。
    我们党认为，今天突出地摆在日程上的尖锐的现实问题，不是同修正主义者调和和团结，而是同他们彻底脱离和分开。面对帝国主义和修正主义的统一战线以及它们的攻击、阴谋活动和战争威胁，马克思列宁主义者应该加强他们国内和国际范围的团结，加强坚决反对帝国主义、修正主义的斗争。
    以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党和伟大的中华人民共和国坚定地和毫不动摇地站在当前反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义的斗争最前列，这是不可否认的历史事实，是各国人民和国际共产主义运动的莫大幸运。中国共产党和中华人民共和国在为国际无产阶级和全世界人民的革命事业而进行的斗争中所起的作用和作出的贡献是巨大的。中国共产党和中华人民共和国今天是社会主义的不可摧毁的堡垒，强大的革命根据地，马克思列宁主义的旗手，我们共同的革命事业的钢铁般的支柱和可靠的后盾。
    帝国主义者和修正主义者企图搞垮中国共产党和中华人民共和国，因为中国共产党和中华人民共和国是他们最强大的敌人，是他们实现霸占和统治世界的企图的不可逾越的障碍。他们企图把各国人民、革命者和马克思列宁主义者同中国共产党隔离开来，以便把她孤立起来，并轻易地消灭我们。世界帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义正在一起攻击人民中国，诬蔑中国的无产阶级文化革命。敌人妄想诋毁伟大的人民中国，这是徒劳的。伟大的人民中国在中国共产党的领导下和毛泽东思想的指导下，正在胜利前进。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党欢呼中国的无产阶级文化革命。中国的无产阶级文化革命，旨在无情地反对人们思想意识中、文化领域和国家生活的一切方面存在的资产阶级思想和修正主义思想，反对阶级敌人和一切企图把人民中国拉到资本主义道路上去的公开的和隐蔽的修正主义分子，反对美帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义和各国反动派。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党认为，处于平等和独立地位的一切马克思列宁主义政党和力量应该同中国共产党和中华人民共和国紧密地团结起来，并且同中国共产党和中华人民共和国筑成一条使我们的一切敌人碰得头破血流的铜墙铁壁。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，作为世界马克思列宁主义力量的积极的一员，她完全意识到，今天共产主义运动面临着保卫马克思列宁主义、推进革命和社会主义事业的伟大历史任务。今后阿尔巴尼亚劳动党将一如既往，同毛泽东的伟大的中国共产党和世界所有的马克思列宁主义政党和力量团结一致，肩并肩地站在一起，全力反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义，毫无保留地支持马克思列宁主义政党和力量的正义革命斗争，并为巩固和加强马克思列宁主义运动在反修斗争中的团结和世界人民在反帝斗争中的团结进行不倦的努力。她相信，胜利必将属于马克思列宁主义、社会主义和各国人民。（附图片）
