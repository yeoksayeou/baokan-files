I would like to talk about the situation of the Chinese technical delegation in our own city—Djerma. The simple and polite Chinese technical personnel have blended in with the residents; they exchange ideas with our people; they are willing to help anyone, they are very simple and clever, and they are completely different from other Western experts who have come to our country.

    中国专家和我们打成一片
    我想谈谈中国技术代表团在我们自己的城里——捷尔马的情况。简朴而有礼貌的中国技术人员和居民打成一片，和我们的人民群众交流思想；他们愿意帮助任何人，他们非常简朴和聪明能干，他们和其他来我国的西方专家截然不同。
