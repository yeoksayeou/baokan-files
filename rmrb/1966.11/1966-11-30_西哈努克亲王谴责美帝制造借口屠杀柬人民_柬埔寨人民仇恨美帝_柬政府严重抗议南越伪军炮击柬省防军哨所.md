Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia Denounces U.S. Imperialism's Fabrication of Excuses to Massacre Cambodian People
Cambodian People Hate U.S. Imperialism
Cambodian Government Strongly Protests South Vietnamese Puppet Army's Shelling of Cambodian Provincial Defense Post

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Phnom Penh on the 26th, Prince Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, delivered a speech in Sihanoukville on the 23rd, condemning U.S. imperialism's aggressive actions against Cambodia and reaffirming Cambodia's resolve to reject U.S. "aid."

According to a report from the Cambodian News Agency, Prince Sihanouk said that he had recently discussed with Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Takeo Miki. He said, "Miki tried to persuade me that Americans are fundamentally sincere peace-lovers, but I proved the opposite to him."

Sihanouk said, "These imperialists have done so many bad things in our country and are still doing so. These imperialists, under the pretext of striking at the South Vietnamese liberation forces, 'are massacring our people every day. How can I not hate them?'"

Sihanouk also said, "These imperialists are saying that they are searching for a regiment of 'Viet Cong' (referring to the South Vietnamese liberation forces) who have fled to the Cambodian border. 'This is another excuse for invading us and killing more Cambodians.'"

Prince Sihanouk said, "Cambodia continues to be the victim of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and mercenaries."

Prince Sihanouk also pointed out that Miki believed that Asians should first seek peace so that our countries can develop rapidly. Sihanouk replied, "Everyone loves peace, but to put peace before complete independence is to put the cart before the horse, because independence is the first thing that should be achieved or consolidated, the first foundation that should be established or strengthened."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Phnom Penh on the 25th, the Cambodian News Agency issued a statement on the 25th, strongly protesting the shelling of a provincial defense post in the Peamontay area of North Lbok, Banteay Meanchey Province, by the South Vietnamese puppet army on the evening of the 22nd.

Some foreign military attachés, many journalists, and members of the International Control Commission arrived at the scene of the serious incident on the 24th and saw for themselves that the boundary line in the area was very clear.

    据新华社金边二十六日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二十三日在西哈努克港发表谈话，谴责美帝国主义对柬埔寨的侵略行动，重申柬埔寨拒绝接受美“援”的决心。
    据柬埔寨新闻社报道，西哈努克亲王说，他最近同日本通商产业大臣三木武夫交谈过。他说，三木“试图说服我，美国人本质上是真诚的和平主义者，可是我却向他证明相反。”
    西哈努克说，这些帝国主义者在我国干了那么多坏事，并且还在不断地干，这些帝国主义者以打击南越解放武装力量为借口，“天天在屠杀我国人民，对于他们，我怎能不仇恨？”
    西哈努克还说，这些帝国主义者昨天还说什么，他们是在搜索逃往柬埔寨边境的一师“越共”（按指南越解放武装力量）。“这又是为再次侵略我们，为杀害另一些柬埔寨人而制造的一个借口。”
    西哈努克亲王说，柬埔寨继续是美帝国主义及其走狗和雇佣军的受害者。
    西哈努克亲王还指出，三木武夫认为，亚洲人首先应当谋求和平，以便使我们的国家迅速发展。西哈努克亲王答复说：“人人都爱和平，但是把和平摆在完全独立之前，这就是本末倒置，因为独立是应当获得的或者应当巩固的第一件事，是应当建立或者应当加强的第一个基础。”
    据新华社金边二十五日电　柬埔寨新闻社二十五日发表了柬埔寨王国政府的一项公报，公报严重抗议南越伪军二十二日晚间炮击柬埔寨波萝勉省北略白县佩昂蒙特亚地方的省防军哨所。
    一些外国使馆的武官、许多记者和国际委员会人员二十四日到达发生这个严重事件的地方，亲眼看到当地的边界线是非常明确的。
