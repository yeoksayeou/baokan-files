Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, an unprecedented undertaking in the history of international communism and human history.

This great revolution, primarily conducted in the realm of ideology, fundamentally aims to eliminate the private ownership concepts that have persisted for thousands of years and to establish socialist public ownership concepts.

Comrade Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, repeatedly instructed us to vigorously advocate for the "public" character, to promote revolutionary and people-oriented thinking, and to cultivate a communist worldview of selflessness. This instruction holds immense and far-reaching significance.

Ideology, culture, customs, habits, political views, legal views, artistic views, and so on—all these constitute the superstructure of society, collectively referred to as culture. Why is a cultural revolution necessary during the socialist period? This is because the economic foundation has undergone fundamental changes. A fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is that the spirit comes from matter, and social consciousness arises from social existence, from the social economic foundation and social ownership system. Social consciousness is secondary, but it also exerts a profound influence on social existence. In our country, the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been achieved, and a socialist public ownership economy has been established. Since the economic foundation has changed, the superstructure of ideology must also change and keep pace. Otherwise, it will hinder the consolidation of socialist ownership, impede the development of new social productive forces, lead to the loss of revolutionary achievements, result in the rule of revisionism, and cause a capitalist restoration, pushing our country back to the old path of colonialism, semi-colonialism, feudalism, and semi-feudalism.

The proletariat rises in revolution to overthrow what? To strive for what? Politically, it is to overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. Economically, it is to abolish the ownership of the landlords and capitalists, gradually transform individual ownership, and establish socialist public ownership. Ideologically, it is to eliminate private ownership concepts and establish socialist public ownership concepts. After the proletariat seizes power, in addition to carrying out the socialist revolution on the economic front, it must also thoroughly carry out the socialist revolution on the ideological and cultural front. Throughout history, any ruling class has established ideological rule that represents its class interests. The proletariat, having seized power, has the right and necessity to establish an ideological rule that represents the interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers, i.e., the rule of Marxist-Leninist thought, and to completely eliminate the old ideology, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, and all ideological forms based on private ownership. Only in this way can the dictatorship of the proletariat be further consolidated, the socialist economy developed, and conditions created for the gradual transition to communism.

What is the essence of old ideology, old culture, old customs, and old habits? The essence of these old things, ultimately, is private ownership. In summary, it is "private." Since the advent of culture, human society for thousands of years has been a class society, characterized by private ownership. All old cultures have been in defense of and service to private ownership. We establish public ownership and consolidate it by eliminating old culture and various private ownership concepts. Private ownership concepts are the root of capitalism and revisionism. The more thoroughly private ownership concepts are eliminated, the more the dictatorship of the proletariat will be consolidated, and the more the socialist economy will develop.

The new ideology, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat can be summarized in one word: "public." We must advocate for the concept of selflessness to consolidate public ownership and build socialism and communism.

A new society needs new people to create it. In a certain sense, communism is selflessness, it is public-mindedness. We must cultivate and mold selfless communist new people. Such people are those whom Chairman Mao has called on us to learn from—people like Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, Liu Huilan, and Lei Feng. Such people are noble, pure, moral, and detached from lowly interests; they are beneficial to the people. They have no selfish motives and dedicate themselves entirely to the people. With a large number of such communist new people, we can successfully carry out the socialist revolution and construction and gradually advance towards communism.

To establish the new, we must destroy the old. To establish the public, we must eliminate the private. Human thought reflects existence, is full of contradictions and struggles, and is class-based. In the socialist period, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between the two roads, will inevitably be reflected in the minds of each of us. When faced with any issue, the question of whether to serve the people or oneself, the collective or the individual, the public or the private, is one that each of us encounters and must answer at every moment. Public or private—this is the psychology, thought, and worldview of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the two classes. In a battle, there is always a winner and a loser. It is either the public overcoming the private or the private overcoming the public. If one is selfish, only seeking personal fame, profit, power, position, and to stand out, always thinking only of oneself or one's small unit, one will forget the whole, forget the people, forget the seven hundred million people, forget the three billion people in the world. Such people have only themselves in mind; their worldview is a "self-centered" view, seeing the world from a self-centered perspective, from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie. Unless we eliminate, overcome, and defeat this bourgeois "self-centered" view, we cannot establish the proletarian worldview of serving all the people of China and the world.

The proletariat must eliminate the private ownership concepts and all ideological forms of the exploiting classes that have been passed down for thousands of years and establish its own ideological rule. To do this, we must thoroughly study Chairman Mao's works and establish Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, the contemporary communist ideological system, and the concentrated expression of proletarian thought. The true representative of new thought, capable of opposing old thought, is the great Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is fundamentally opposed to private ownership concepts and all ideological forms of the exploiting classes; it is the most powerful ideological weapon for transforming people's souls.

Under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, selfless communist new people are growing and emerging in large numbers. Lei Feng is such a person. Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, Mai Xiande, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, and others are such people. The advanced units like the Good Eighth Company, the Hard Sixth Company, and the Red Ninth Company, and the heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team are such people. Throughout the army and the country, on various different posts, there are countless communist heroes who do not seek fame or profit, who are not afraid of hardship or death, and who dedicate themselves to the revolution and the people. They are the pride of our era and the hope for the future new world of communism.

Chairman Mao said, "Among all things in the world, man is the most precious." We build socialism and communism through people. In all our work, we emphasize the human factor and put people at the center. We focus on the superstructure, on ideology, on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, doing work on people, on political and ideological work, on educating, transforming, and arming people with Mao Zedong Thought. We build the army and the country not like modern revisionists, who focus one-sidedly on material things, mechanization, and modernization. We primarily focus on the ideological revolutionization of people, using revolutionization to guide, lead, and promote mechanization and modernization. We must spread Mao Zedong Thought throughout the Party, the army, and the people, promote the ideological revolutionization of people, and unify people's thoughts and actions. This is the fundamental direction and task of political work.

In the deepening development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the deepening of the socialist revolution, the question of whether to be public or private becomes increasingly prominent and sharp, standing before each of us. Breaking the private and establishing the public is the core issue of transforming the worldview. To thoroughly break the "private" and establish the "public," we must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Constantly Read Articles." The "Three Constantly Read Articles" are our compulsory course for transforming the worldview. Every Communist Party member and every cadre and soldier must, according to Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a motto. Comrade Lin Biao proposed that each of us should regard ourselves as both the motive force of the revolution, making the greatest efforts to contribute to the people, and the object of the revolution, constantly engaging in self-criticism and continuously transforming ourselves. We must have a high degree of revolutionary consciousness, liberating ourselves from "self" and from the limitations of localism and factionalism, truly becoming a complete Communist Party member, a proletarian revolutionary fighter who understands the big picture, considers the overall situation, and is selfless.

In the new stage of the army's movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly break the bourgeois "private" character, and establish the proletarian "public" character, taking big strides forward on the path of the army's revolutionary construction!

    再论提倡一个“公”字
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是国际共产主义运动和人类历史上前所未有的创举。
    这场主要在意识形态领域里进行的大革命，从根本上说，是破除几千年来的私有观念，建立社会主义公有观念的大革命。
    林彪同志根据毛主席的教导，一再指示我们，必须大力提倡一个“公”字，提倡为革命、为人民的思想，树立一心为公的共产主义世界观。这个指示，具有极其重大和深远的意义。
    思想，文化，风俗，习惯，政治观点，法律观点，艺术观点，等等，这些都是社会意识形态，概括起来叫文化。社会主义时期，为什么要搞文化革命？这是因为社会经济基础发生了根本变化。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的一个根本原理，就是精神从物质来，社会意识从社会存在来，从社会经济基础、社会占有制度来。社会意识是第二性的，同时，又给予伟大影响和作用于社会存在。在我国，已经实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，建立了社会主义公有制经济。经济基础既然发生了变化，意识形态这个上层建筑一定要跟着变化，要赶上去。否则，就会妨碍社会主义所有制的巩固，就会使新的社会生产力不能得到发展，就会丧失革命的既得成果，就会出现修正主义的统治，出现资本主义复辟，使我国退回到殖民地半殖民地、封建半封建的老路上去。
    无产阶级起来革命，推翻的是什么？争取的是什么？在政治上，是推翻资产阶级的统治，建立无产阶级专政。在经济上，是废除地主、资本家的占有制，逐步改造个体所有制，建立社会主义公有制。在思想上，是破除私有观念，建立社会主义公有观念。无产阶级取得政权后，除了进行经济战线上的社会主义革命以外，还必须把思想文化战线上的社会主义革命进行到底。历史上任何统治阶级，都要建立代表本阶级利益的思想的统治。取得了政权的无产阶级，有权力、有必要建立代表无产阶级和广大劳动人民利益的思想，即马克思列宁主义思想的统治，把剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，把一切在私有制基础上形成的意识形态统统打掉。只有这样，才能进一步巩固无产阶级专政，发展社会主义经济，为逐步过渡到共产主义创造条件。
    旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的本质是什么？这些旧东西的本质，说来说去，归到私有观念上。概括到一个字，就是“私”。自有文化以来，几千年的人类社会，都是阶级社会，它的共同点，就是私有制。一切旧文化，都是为私有制辩护，为私有制服务的。我们建立公有制，巩固公有制，必须破除旧文化，破除形形色色的私有观念。私有观念是产生资本主义、修正主义的根子。私有观念破得愈彻底，无产阶级的政权才能愈巩固，社会主义经济才能愈发展。
    无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，可以概括到一个“公”字上。我们要巩固公有制，建设社会主义和共产主义，就必须提倡一心为公的观念，提倡一个“公”字。
    新社会需要新人来创造。在某种意义上讲，共产主义就是无私，就是为公。我们要培养和塑造一心为公的共产主义新人。这样的人，就是毛主席号召我们学习的张思德、白求恩、刘胡兰、雷锋式的人。这样的人，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。他们毫无自私自利之心，全心全意为人民，完全彻底为人民。有了大量的共产主义新人，才能胜利地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，才能逐步地到达共产主义。
    不破不立。立公，必须破私。人的思想是存在的反映，是有矛盾和斗争的，是有阶级性的。在社会主义时期，无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，必然要反映到我们每个人的脑子里来。一事当前，是为人民还是为自己，为集体还是为个人，为公还是为私，这是每个人每时每刻都会遇到，都要回答的问题。为公、为私，这是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的心理，两个阶级的思想，两个阶级的世界观。两军对战，总有胜负。不是这个克服那个，就是那个克服这个。不是为公，就是为私。为私，只顾个人争名，争利，争权，争位，争出风头等等，处处只想到自己，只想到自己一个小单位，就会忘记了整体，忘记了人民，忘记了七亿人口，忘记了世界上三十亿人口。这种人，心目中只有自己一口，他们的世界观，是“一口观”，站在一口上看世界，站在资产阶级立场上看待一切。不破除、不克服、不打倒这种资产阶级“一口观”，就不能确立为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的无产阶级世界观。
    无产阶级要破除几千年来遗留下来的私有观念和一切剥削阶级的意识形态，确立自己思想的统治，就要大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是当代的共产主义思想体系，是无产阶级思想的集中表现。真正代表新思想的，足以对抗旧思想的，就是伟大的毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是同私有观念和一切剥削阶级意识形态根本对立的，是改造人们灵魂的最强大的思想武器。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育下，一心为公的共产主义新人，正在大量地成长和涌现出来。雷锋，是这样的人。欧阳海、王杰、焦裕禄、麦贤得、刘英俊、蔡永祥等等，是这样的人。好八连、硬六连、红九连等先进单位的先进人物和32111钻井队的英雄们，是这样的人。在全军和全国各地，在各种不同的岗位上，有着许许多多不为名、不为利、不怕苦、不怕死、一心为革命、一心为人民的共产主义英雄。这是我们时代的骄傲。这是未来的新世界——共产主义世界的希望。
    毛主席说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。”我们建设社会主义，建设共产主义，都靠人。我们做一切工作，都突出人的因素，都以人为中心。我们抓上层建筑，抓意识形态，抓无产阶级文化大革命，就是做人的工作，做政治思想工作，做用毛泽东思想教育人、改造人、武装人的工作。我们建设军队，建设国家，不是像现代修正主义者那样，片面地搞物质，搞机械化、现代化。我们主要是搞人的思想革命化，以革命化统帅、引导和推动机械化、现代化。把毛泽东思想贯彻到全党全军全国人民中去，促进人的思想革命化，统一人们的思想和行动，这是政治工作的根本方向，根本任务。
    在无产阶级文化大革命更加深入发展，社会主义革命更加深入发展的情况下，为公还是为私的问题，越来越突出、越来越尖锐地摆在我们每个同志的面前。破私立公，是改造世界观的核心问题。要大破“私”字，大立“公”字，就要活学活用毛主席著作，特别是活学活用“老三篇”。“老三篇”是我们改造世界观的必修课。每个共产党员，每个干部战士，都要按照林彪同志的指示，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学。林彪同志提出，我们每个同志既要把自己当作革命的动力，尽最大努力为人民作出贡献，同时又要把自己当作革命的对象，经常进行自我批评，不断革自己的命。我们一定要有高度的革命自觉性，把自己从“我”字中解放出来，从本位主义、山头主义的局限性里面解放出来，使自己真正成为一个完全的共产党员，一个识大体、顾大局、大公无私的无产阶级革命战士。青年同志应当这样，老同志更应当兢兢业业，克己奉公，忠心耿耿，保持晚节，为下一代作出榜样。
    在我军活学活用毛主席著作运动的新阶段，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，在我军革命化建设的道路上大踏步地向前迈进！
