Late at night, a few young people came to the square in front of the Beijing Municipal Reception Station. They searched among the crowds of revolutionary teachers and students who had just gotten off the train from outside. Soon, they talked with a couple of Red Guards, woke up their drowsy comrades, and sent them onto buses. Then, they asked a few students with thin clothes, draped their own cotton coats over them, and sent them to the same bus. Once a bus was full, the driver immediately took these new arrivals to their accommodations, then returned to pick up another group.

Who were these young people? Who were they picking up? They were students from the reception office of the Central Conservatory of Music. Every day, they weren't looking for their friends or guests who had arranged to visit their school in advance. Instead, they were looking for Red Guards who had lost contact with their large teams after traveling from afar to Beijing, and students who were thinly clad and urgently needed a place to rest.

As soon as you step into the Central Conservatory of Music, you will find many such revolutionary youngsters.

Look, that lively and rosy-cheeked student is the son of a poor peasant from Ganjiawan in Lanzhou. He originally came to Beijing with his school's team. However, after boarding the train, due to the large number of people, he lost contact with his classmates. When he arrived in Beijing and stood at the square in front of the Municipal Reception Station, he was anxious. At that moment, students from the Central Conservatory of Music came and took him in.

That female student wearing a thick cotton coat is the child of a revolutionary cadre from Fuzhou. Fuzhou people coming to Beijing remember to bring thick cotton coats, thinking ahead, right? No, it was precisely because she came with thin clothes that she was specially taken in by the students of the Central Conservatory of Music. The coat she was wearing was borrowed from a student at the reception station of the Central Conservatory of Music.

Over there are two students from Liuzhou. As soon as they got off the train, they found that Beijing's weather was very cold and that many students from outside had come. They regretted coming at the wrong time, but students from the Central Conservatory of Music noticed them and took them in. They had asked the students of the Central Conservatory of Music how they thought of taking them in. The students of the Central Conservatory of Music said, "Seeing that you have few clothes, we know you must be cold. You being cold is like us being cold, so we want to quickly find a place for you to stay."

Since November 10, the Central Conservatory of Music has received nearly five thousand revolutionary teachers and students from outside, most of whom are such guests. These guests come from all over the country, from hundreds of schools, which brings many difficulties to the reception work. However, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Central Conservatory of Music, with their sky-high enthusiasm and meticulous work, overcame various difficulties and received them all quite satisfactorily.

Before carrying out the reception work, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Central Conservatory of Music seriously studied the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee on the revolutionary big link-up. They recognized the great significance of the big link-up and decided to further do a good job in receiving revolutionary teachers and students from outside. This school originally had only over three hundred students, and now there are still over a hundred people linking up outside. With fewer hands, they find ways to do the work of several people. The reception place is small, so they made a big adjustment to the offices and dormitories, freeing up as much space as possible. Many students sleep on the ground instead of beds to free up more rooms for outside students.

Initially, some people suggested only receiving those large teams coming to Beijing. After studying and discussing, and understanding the situation at the Municipal Reception Station, they still decided to voluntarily take on the heavy burden of receiving "scattered" guests.

The Central Conservatory of Music originally did not have a Muslim canteen. However, there are Muslim students among those coming from outside. They invited Muslim cooks from outside to prepare Muslim meals.

The revolutionary teachers and students of the Central Conservatory of Music pay attention to helping their guests politically and ideologically. They organize the "scattered" guests into classes and platoons, elect a study commissioner for each platoon, organize everyone to study the "Three Articles," and call on everyone to do good deeds; they also often use broadcasts and other means to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the young revolutionaries. They make use of their strengths to organize several performances for revolutionary teachers and students from outside, singing revolutionary songs together with outside students. Usually, they plan to teach outside students to sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. Revolutionary songs often echo throughout the entire campus.

    他们主动挑了一副重担子
    ——记中央音乐学院革命师生热情接待外地革命师生
    深夜，几个青年人来到北京市接待站前的广场上，在刚下火车的外地革命师生队伍中找来找去。一会儿，他们同一两个红卫兵谈谈，叫醒他们朦胧入睡的伙伴，送他们登上汽车；一会儿，他们又问问另外几个衣衫单薄的学生，把自己的棉衣披在他们身上，送他们坐到同一辆汽车上去。一辆车坐满了，司机同志立即开车把这些新来的客人送到住宿地点，然后，再把车开回来，接另一车客人。
    这些青年人是谁？他们来接些什么人呢？他们是中央音乐学院接待室的学生。他们每天来找的，既不是他们的亲友，也不是事先约好要到他们学校去的客人，而是那些远道来京、同大队失去联系的红卫兵和那些衣衫单薄急需住下来休息的学生。
    一跨进中央音乐学院的大门，你就会发现许多这样的革命小将。
    你看，那个活蹦乱跳，两颊绯红的学生，是来自兰州市共家湾的一个贫农的儿子。他本来随着学校的队伍一块坐火车来北京。可是，上车以后，因为人多，就同其他同学失去了联系。当他一个人来到北京，来到市接待站前的广场上，正在着急的时候，中央音乐学院的学生就把他接来了。
    那个穿着厚棉大衣的女学生，是福州市一个革命干部的孩子。福州人来北京，记着带厚棉大衣，想的可真周到啊。不，她正是因为来的时候穿得单薄，才被中央音乐学院的同学特意接来的。她穿的大衣，是中央音乐学院接待站的一位同学借给她的。
    那边是两个从柳州来的学生。他们一下火车就发现北京的天气很冷，外地的同学来得很多。他们正后悔来得不是时候，中央音乐学院的同学就发现了他们，把他们接来了。他们曾经问过中央音乐学院的同学，怎么想到要把他俩接到这里来？音乐学院的同学说：“看你们穿的衣服很少，知道你们一定很冷。你们冷，就像我们冷一样，所以想赶快给你们找个地方住下。”
    从十一月十日起，中央音乐学院已经先后接待将近五千名外地师生，其中大部分是这样的客人。这些客人，来自山南海北，来自成百上千个学校，这就给接待工作带来了许多困难。但是，中央音乐学院的革命师生以冲天的干劲，以周到细致的工作，克服了种种困难，把他们接待得都相当满意。
    中央音乐学院的革命师生在开展接待工作以前，认真学习了毛主席、党中央关于革命大串连的指示。他们认清了大串连的伟大意义，决心进一步作好接待外地革命师生的工作。这个学校原来只有三百多学生，现在还有一百多人在外地串连。人手少，就设法一个人干几个人的事。接待的地方小，就把办公室、宿舍来个大调整，尽量腾出地方来。许多同学不睡床铺睡地铺，多腾房间给外地同学住。
    开初，有的人也主张只接待那些大批来京的队伍，经过学习讨论，并且到市接待站了解情况以后，他们还是决定主动挑起接待“零散”客人的重担子。
    中央音乐学院原来没有回民食堂。但是，外地来的师生当中有回民。他们就从外边请来回族炊事员，做起了回民饭菜。
    中央音乐学院的革命师生，注意从政治思想方面帮助自己的客人们。他们把“零散”的客人编成班、排，每个排选出一个学习委员，组织大家学习“老三篇”，号召大家做好人好事；他们还经常通过广播等方式，向小将们宣传毛泽东思想。他们发挥自己的特长，为外地革命师生组织了几次演出会，同外地同学一起大唱革命歌曲。平时，他们有计划地教外地同学唱毛主席语录歌。革命的歌声，经常响彻整个校园。
