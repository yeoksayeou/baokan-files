Mountains cannot block the way of the determined, and difficulties cannot frighten heroes. No matter how big the waves, they are beneath our ship. No matter how high the mountains, they are under our feet. With great enthusiasm, we navigate through storms and charge ahead on the Long March. Difficulties are always present, but we must never bow our heads. Face the difficulties head-on, and they will flow away like water. In the face of heroes, there are no difficulties. In the face of difficulties, heroes are forged.

  汉。
