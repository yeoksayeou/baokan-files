	Guangdong is striving to produce more high-quality sugar for the country. Despite a widespread drought this year, most sugarcane areas in Guangdong have still managed to increase production. Sugar factories that have already started processing have met the planned targets for both the quantity and quality of sugar produced.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 25th: The 1966-1967 sugarcane processing season in Guangdong has begun. Workers in the sugar industry are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, combining revolution with production in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and striving to produce more and better sugar for the country.

	Since mid-October, many sugar factories in Guangdong Province have started processing. Other sugar factories will also begin processing in late November or early December. Sugar industry workers have actively responded to the call of Comrade Lin Biao, deeply engaging in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionization of workers' thoughts has promoted production. Sugar factories that have already started processing have met the planned targets in terms of sugarcane processing volume, extraction rate, production safety rate, and the quantity and quality of sugar produced.

	Although Guangdong Province experienced a widespread drought this year, most regions still managed to produce more sugarcane than in previous years. Currently, large quantities of sugarcane are being continuously transported to the factories.

    广东努力为国家多榨好糖
    今年广东普遍受旱，大部蔗区仍然增产。已开榨的糖厂，蔗糖产量、质量等都达到了计划要求
    据新华社广州二十五日电　广东一九六六年至一九六七年榨糖季节已经开始。制糖工业战线职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命中，抓革命，促生产，努力为国家多产糖，产好糖。
    十月中旬以来，广东省许多糖厂已经先后开榨。另外一些糖厂也将在十一月下旬或十二月初陆续开榨。制糖工业职工积极响应林彪同志的号召，深入开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。职工思想革命化促进了生产，已经开榨的糖厂，在榨蔗量、压榨收回率、生产安全率和蔗糖产量、质量等方面，都达到了计划要求。
    今年广东省虽然普遍受旱，但是大部分地区甘蔗仍然比往年增产。目前大批甘蔗正源源不断地运进工厂。
