Prince Sissowath Essaroth of Cambodia, representative of the Cambodian Royal Government to the Sports Bureau and vice-chairman of the Cambodian National Organizing Committee for the First Asian New Forces Games, recently issued a statement saying: The First Asian New Forces Games will definitely foil the imperialists' sabotage plots, will be held as scheduled in Phnom Penh, and will certainly achieve great success. He pointed out that imperialism thought it could intimidate us with threats, but they have miscalculated again.

Prince Essaroth said: The First Asian New Forces Games will strengthen the unity of the new emerging forces in Asia, and this unity will foil the imperialists' tyranny. He pointed out that imperialism attempts to impose their will on us, but the era of colonialism has long passed. He condemned the International Olympic Committee and the international sports federations under its control for harboring malicious intentions, using despicable plots and exerting pressure on many countries to prevent them from participating in the games to be held in Phnom Penh. He finally pointed out: Cambodia is willing to act as a bridge to strengthen friendship among peoples of various countries and to demonstrate to the world the unity of the new emerging forces in Asia.
