The entire staff of the Chinese Embassy in Ghana, led by Chargé d'Affaires Huang Shixian, returned to Beijing on the evening of November 11th. They had left Accra on November 5th after the reactionary military junta in Ghana unilaterally announced the severance of relations between China and Ghana. The Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Accra also returned to Beijing on the same flight.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, along with relevant officials Qi Pengfei, Li Qiang, Li Yingji, and Wang Weizhen, were at the airport to warmly welcome them. The welcoming crowd presented the returning comrades with copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."
