A brand-new "Sports City" has recently emerged with dazzling splendor in the southwestern part of the beautiful city of Phnom Penh. This "Sports City," with a construction area of 19,000 square meters, is the crystallization of the combined wisdom, labor, and deep friendship of the peoples of China and Cambodia. It is a gift to the First Asian New Force Games.

The birth of this "Sports City" is a new song of Sino-Cambodian friendship. The director of the "Sports City," Colonel Pol Serei, told reporters: The decision to hold the Asian New Force Games in Phnom Penh was made at a very urgent time. We are fortunate to have received the help and cooperation of the Chinese government and Chinese experts, who completed this perfect "Sports City" in just five to six months at a high speed. This is another symbol of Cambodian-Chinese friendship.

During the construction period, it was the rainy season in Cambodia. To save every second and ensure progress, the construction site saw a moving scene of Chinese experts and Cambodian workers fighting side by side under the torrential rains of Southeast Asia.

The Chinese experts, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, worked tirelessly on the "Sports City" construction site, overcoming difficulties and contributing their strength to the friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia. Even under the scorching heat with temperatures reaching 48 degrees Celsius, they did not rest for a single day. When building the foundation of a building, a deep muddy pit appeared. The Chinese experts studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, brought out the spirit of the foolish old man. They took the lead in jumping into the muddy pit up to their waists to drain water and dig out the mud, completing the task in three days. Some experts fainted under the scorching sun, but after being revived by doctors, they immediately requested to return to the construction site. To ensure quality, the Chinese experts learned from Mao Zedong's emphasis on White's pursuit of technical excellence, combining the assurance of project quality with teaching technical knowledge to Cambodian workers, thereby improving the technical skills of Cambodian workers.

The song of Sino-Cambodian friendship in the construction of the "Sports City" quickly spread throughout Phnom Penh. When the Chinese experts went to and from work, many Cambodians on the street raised their thumbs and shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" A small factory through which the Chinese experts frequently passed had workers who wrote a sign saying "Hello, Chinese experts!" and held it up to greet the Chinese experts whenever they passed by. One day, a Cambodian woman suddenly ran to the construction site to greet the Chinese experts with folded hands. It turned out that her nephew was injured at work on the construction site, and the Chinese experts not only treated his injury but also cared for his life, so she specially came to thank the Chinese experts. She said, moved, "You are truly good experts sent by Chairman Mao. I will never forget this!"

    中柬友谊的一曲新歌
    一座崭新的“体育城”最近以夺目的光辉出现在美丽的金边市区西南部。这座建筑面积达一万九千平方米的“体育城”，是中柬两国人民共同智慧、共同劳动和深厚友谊的结晶，是对第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会的献礼。
    这座“体育城”的诞生是中柬友谊的一曲新歌。“体育城”主任波烈赛少校对记者说：决定在金边举行亚新会的时间是十分紧迫的。我们庆幸得到中国政府和中国专家的帮助和合作，以五、六个月时间的高速度建成这座完善的“体育城”。这是柬中友谊的又一个象征。
    工程进行期间正是柬埔寨的雨季，为了争分秒，保进度，在工地上出现了中国专家和柬埔寨工人冒着东南亚热带倾盆大雨，并肩奋战的动人场面。
    毛泽东思想武装起来的中国专家，在“体育城”工地上，不怕困难，辛勤劳动，为中柬两国人民的友谊贡献自己的力量。他们在地面温度高达摄氏四十八度的酷热下也没有休息过一天。在修建一座楼房的地基时，出现很深的泥塘，中国专家们学习了《愚公移山》，按照伟大的领袖毛主席的教导，拿出老愚公的精神来干，带头跳下泥水齐腰的泥塘排水挖泥，三天就完成了任务。有的专家在烈日下昏倒，经医生救醒后，又马上要求重上工地。为了保证质量，中国专家学习毛主席指出的白求恩对技术精益求精的精神，把保证工程质量和向柬埔寨工人讲解技术知识结合起来，使柬埔寨工人技术能力得到提高。
    修建“体育城”这曲中柬友谊的新歌，很快就传遍金边市。在中国专家上下班时，街上许多柬埔寨人竖起大拇指高呼“毛泽东万岁！”有一家中国专家来往必经的小工厂的工人，写了一个“中国专家，你好！”的牌子，每当中国专家过路的时候就把牌子举出来向中国专家致意。一天有一个柬埔寨妇女突然跑到工地向中国专家合十致意。原来她的侄子在工地工作因工受伤，中国专家给他治好了伤，又十分关怀他的生活，因而她特地跑来向中国专家致谢。她感动地说：你们真是毛主席派来的好专家，我永远忘不了！
