On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, I would like to share some of my thoughts on the life and activities of this great son of the Chinese people.

He was born before the era of imperialist monopoly capitalism. At the time of his birth, the domestic feudal dynasty had just been shaken by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolution, and the Chinese people had just begun to come into contact with capitalist countries.

When he left this world, the forces of imperialism were at their zenith. European powers were scheming to carve up China's territory, and the militarism of neighboring Japan was constantly threatening the very existence of our entire nation. The country was divided into several parts by warlords, each of whom directly or indirectly colluded with an imperialist country, monopolizing the import of weapons and ammunition in their respective territories. China, which was then fragmented, had become a prey for imperialist powers to fight over.

Today, China has undergone such a great and historically significant transformation! Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have removed the three mountains of imperialist aggression, feudal rule, and bureaucratic capitalist monopoly. The Chinese people have not only successfully completed the new democratic revolution but have also achieved brilliant successes in the socialist revolution and construction. The Chinese people are closely united. Our political system, social organization, and economy are fundamentally more advanced than those of Western capitalist countries, while imperialism is beginning to disintegrate and is facing unavoidable political and economic crises.

So, why do we still commemorate Sun Yat-sen today? I think it is to forever remember this steadfast and indomitable revolutionary of the Chinese democratic revolution, the great pioneer of the Chinese revolution.

First, let me talk about Sun Yat-sen's character.

Sun Yat-sen was a man of far-sighted vision and profound foresight. Therefore, his life was that of a tenacious revolutionary. From the beginning, he did not believe in the feudal dynasty, and as the revolution developed, he gained increasing confidence in the people. He saw the corruption in officialdom, the rulers' tyranny over the people, and their subservience to imperialism, so he decided to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. In stark contrast to him were his contemporaries such as Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and Yan Fu, who, although fully aware of the various shortcomings of the monarchical system, did not trust the people and dared not carry out a revolution or establish a republican system. They advocated constitutional monarchy. Kang Youwei even participated in a small group that attempted to restore the Qing Emperor.

More than sixty years ago, in July 1905, Sun Yat-sen, in a speech to overseas Chinese and students in Tokyo, refuted the program of constitutional monarchy. He said: "Moreover, the world's constitutionalism must be achieved through bloodshed to be genuine. Since bloodshed is inevitable, why not opt for a straightforward republic instead of an incomplete constitutional system?" Sun Yat-sen had the confidence and courage to proclaim this because he firmly believed that the Chinese people could surpass Japan, and even Western capitalist countries, in a relatively short time. Reformists like Liang Qichao, however, insisted that the Chinese people could only imitate and follow the West and had no ability to surpass it. In the face of Western countries, Liang Qichao and all the reformists were simply cowards.

At that time, conservatives and reformists mocked Sun Yat-sen as "Sun the Cannon." This only showed that they themselves were shortsighted, lacked courage and confidence, and lacked sympathy for the people who always seek progress. We know that ideals and foresight are necessary prerequisites for revolution. Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolution.

A revolutionary, a person who dedicates himself entirely to the interests of the people, is always tireless and always sees the future as bright. In 1913, long before he began corresponding with Lenin (these letters were delivered by Comrade Malin, who still lives in Leningrad), Lenin spoke about the "backward Europe and advanced Asia" from the perspective of revolutionary spirit and revolutionary prospects. Lenin was a great encouragement to Sun Yat-sen. Lenin was also full of confidence in the victory of the Chinese revolution that was then underway.

Sun Yat-sen understood China's history very well. He had a clear view of the exploiters and the exploited under the feudal system.

According to Ma Xiang (Ma Xiang was originally an overseas Chinese worker in the United States, later participated in the revolution, and from 1916 onwards served as Sun Yat-sen's bodyguard, chief bodyguard, and adjutant until Mr. Sun's death), in 1916 in Shanghai, "once, I followed Mr. Sun on foot to Yu Garden Road. He suddenly pointed to the rows of houses by the roadside and said to me: 'Look! This area of Yu Garden Road was once a graveyard, and now it is full of luxurious houses. These houses are built by our warlords. They control the land, levy heavy taxes, open opium dens and gambling houses, commit all kinds of evil, and drain the people's blood and sweat to build houses here, marry concubines, play mahjong, drink foreign liquor, and eat Western food, making workers and peasants unable to eat their fill and keep warm. How can China not perish? Therefore, we must overthrow the warlords.'"

In October 1921, Sun Yat-sen visited Nanning, Guangxi, and gave a speech at a mass rally. He told the audience: "Revolution is to make workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life live a good life... You are the masters, and the governor is the servant. A servant must do his job to satisfy the master, and that is a good governor, a good servant. Governor Ma (Junwu) should first retrieve the cash deposited by Lu Rongting and Tan Haoming (local warlords) in foreign banks in Shanghai and take out all their property in the province to distribute to everyone, so that everyone has clothes to wear and shoes to put on."

In 1923, in Guangzhou, one day he went to Baiyun Mountain, and a group of ragged peasants followed him. He said to them: "I just saw the villages near the foot of the mountain below; they are either thatched huts or mud-walled houses, so I can infer that your livelihood is not sufficient. The reason for this is that the land system is not good, and the farmers have to pay a large amount of rent every year. This problem I will definitely solve."

From his personal life of simplicity, we can see another great aspect of Sun Yat-sen. He never owned a house. When he lived in Shanghai, he first lived at 63 Huanlong Road, which was a rented house, and later moved to 29 Molilai Road, which is now the Sun Yat-sen Memorial House. This small residence was given to him by overseas Chinese members of the Kuomintang.

The Yong'an Company in Shanghai was founded by overseas Chinese from Australia. The manager, Guo Biao, once sent someone to give Sun Yat-sen a fur coat. When this matter was reported to Sun Yat-sen, Ma Xiang recalled: "Mr. Sun was surprised and said: 'Shanghai is not very cold, and it is even less cold in Guangdong. I don't go to the north, so I won't accept it. You take it back and return it to him!' Two days later, Guo Biao came to see Sun Yat-sen, and Sun Yat-sen thanked him for his good intentions but bluntly said that he had no reason to accept such a luxurious gift.

In 1924, Sun Yat-sen lectured on the Three Principles of the People in Guangzhou. The lecture venue was Guangdong University. Each time, more than ten cadres accompanied him from the Presidential Palace to the other side of the Pearl River and then took three cars to the venue. Sun Yat-sen inquired and found out that the cars took four or five miles round trip and cost fifteen yuan. After that, he no longer took the car but walked with the cadres.

Sun Yat-sen's lifelong love of learning is something that everyone who knew him admires and respects. From 1913 to 1916, he was in Tokyo. Old member of the Alliance Society, Qiu Ao, recalled: "His residence was filled with books on all four walls, including the Thirteen Classics, the Twenty-Four Histories, political and economic books from China and abroad, and various maps. He often read books and never put them down; he understood them thoroughly and grasped the essence." Sun Yat-sen's study was filled with books, and he often read them, never putting them down. He understood them thoroughly and grasped the essence.

I myself remember that whenever he had a moment of spare time, he would spread a large map on the floor in his study, holding a dark pencil and an eraser, marking out railways, rivers, harbors, etc. He subscribed to a British-published shipping annual, knowing a lot about ship tonnage, draft, and the like. Once, when he inspected Haicheng on a cruiser, he told the first officer that the waterway was shallow and that the ship should be driven along the outer line. But this first officer thought he knew the situation better, and as a result, the ship ran aground.

Finally, I would like to use a passage from the Filipino writer Mariano Ponce to illustrate that Sun Yat-sen saw very early on that the revolutionary problems of the countries in Asia were an integral whole. Ponce met Sun Yat-sen in Japan in 1899-1900, when the Philippines had just broken free from Spanish colonial rule and was engaged in a fierce armed struggle against the predatory American imperialism. Ponce wrote: "Sun Yat-sen was familiar with the situation in the Philippines and closely followed its development with great interest. He had studied with great enthusiasm the deeds of Rizal, Del Pilar, and other great figures of our country.... In Sun Yat-sen's view, the problems of the Far East were so closely related that to understand the problems of each country separately, one must explore these countries as a whole.... Therefore, Sun Yat-sen was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the 'East Asia Youth Association.' This association was organized by students from Korea, China, Japan, India, Siam, and the Philippines in Tokyo... Sun Yat-sen showed genuine concern for all issues related to East Asia. He studied these issues and helped the relevant parties find solutions." Ponce also quoted his correspondence with Sun Yat-sen in 1899, discussing the funding and weapons for the anti-imperialist armed struggle.

Such contacts were continuous. I remember that in 1915 and the following period, our residence in Tokyo was often filled with revolutionaries from Asia and around the world.

Now, let me talk about some episodes in Sun Yat-sen's life and how these experiences influenced his life.

Sun Yat-sen was born into a poor peasant family, sometimes not having enough food to eat, and had to fill his stomach with sweet potatoes. In his childhood, storytellers often told stories about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and other peasant uprisings in the evenings, which fascinated him. His family background, his shared life with the oppressed masses, and the stories of the people's struggle to break free from oppression left an indelible impression on his mind. Later developments proved that these childhood experiences played a decisive role in his decision to dedicate his life to the revolution.

He could not afford to go to school in his home country. Because he had a brother farming in Hawaii, he had the opportunity to go abroad to study. Although he was in a foreign land for a long time, separated from his motherland, his thoughts and feelings never left his homeland. When he left Honolulu to return to China, his thoughts had already progressed, believing that the only way out for China was to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. When formulating a political program as the basis for spreading revolutionary ideas, he proposed the first slogan: "The sacred right is not eternal!"

When he began to rally comrades, he considered that for survival, he needed a profession to cover up his revolutionary activities. He chose the profession of a doctor. On the one hand, he studied at the Guangzhou Bo Ai Medical School, and on the other hand, he advocated revolution. In the school, he met Zheng Shiliang, who enthusiastically agreed with Sun Yat-sen's proposal. The two began to rally more young people to join the revolution and constantly discussed the strategy of struggle. A year later, Sun Yat-sen transferred to the Hong Kong College of Western Medicine because the curriculum there was more complete. In Hong Kong, he met Chen Shaobai, You Shaowen, Yang Heliang, and Lu Haodong, his comrades-in-arms.

After graduation, Sun Yat-sen practiced medicine in Macao, and according to the original plan, his main purpose was still to carry out the revolution. He organized a secret society, the "Xingzhonghui," which was officially established in Honolulu in 1894. At the same time, he established "Qianhenghang" in Hong Kong and "Nongxuehui" in Guangzhou, which were actually the revolutionary leadership organizations.

The incompetence of the Qing court led to the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War. Sun Yat-sen could no longer wait, feeling that only revolution could save the motherland. The time to launch the first strike had come. In October 1895, Sun Yat-sen prepared to launch an armed attack on the Qing officials in Guangzhou, but he suffered the first failure. The original plan was to give the revolutionary party 600 guns, which were intercepted by the Qing officials on the ship. His two close comrades, Lu Haodong and Zhu Guifu, were martyred, and another 70 comrades were arrested and imprisoned. The Qing court ordered the arrest of Sun Yat-sen, who escaped from the clutches of the enemy, fled to Hawaii, and later went to the United States, Britain, and various parts of Europe.

As soon as he arrived overseas, Sun Yat-sen immediately resumed revolutionary activities. He went everywhere among the overseas Chinese and students to propagate and organize. From 1896 to 1899, he visited all the European centers where there were Chinese living and studying—London, Paris, Brussels, Geneva, Berlin. When propagating nationalism, he found that people were very receptive. Although the Manchu dynasty had ruled China for more than two hundred years, among the overseas Chinese, the national consciousness of the Han people had not been extinguished because after the fall of the Ming Dynasty in 1644, some scholars fled overseas and established secret organizations, passing down the national consciousness from generation to generation. Sun Yat-sen not only obtained moral support from the overseas Chinese for his proposals but also obtained a large amount of funds to support his business of overthrowing the Qing government.

It was during this period of overseas activities that Sun Yat-sen, based on his understanding at the time, formulated his nationalism, people's rights, and people's livelihood. He knew Marx and Engels, and he also heard news about Lenin and the revolutionary activities of Russian workers. As early as then, socialism had attracted him. He urged students to study Marx's "Capital" and the "Communist Manifesto" and to read contemporary socialist publications.

While engaging in these activities, Sun Yat-sen's life was hard, and he often risked his life. But his belief in the revolution never wavered, and he never relaxed in seeking opportunities to strike at the oppressors of the Chinese people. In October 1896, when he was engaged in revolutionary activities in London, he once narrowly escaped death. On October 11, he passed by the Chinese consulate and was recognized by the consulate staff, who then kidnapped him. The Qing officials imprisoned him strictly in the consulate, waiting for a ship to send him back to China to be beheaded. The only person he could contact was an old female servant who brought him water every day.

Fortunately, not long before, when Sun Yat-sen was in Honolulu, he once walked on the road and saw a carriage coming towards him. Unexpectedly, the person sitting in the carriage was his teacher, Dr. James Cantlie, and his wife, whom he had known in Hong Kong. They told him that they had retired and were on their way back to their country, and they also left him their address in London.

After many attempts, Sun Yat-sen finally obtained the old female servant's agreement to send a note to Dr. Cantlie. Upon receiving the news, Dr. Cantlie immediately tried to rescue him. After Sun Yat-sen was released, he lived with these British friends. But the danger had not passed, and wherever he went, someone was always following him. Many times, he had to disguise himself to shake off the enemy's pursuit.

In 1899, he took a route to Japan and actively prepared for the second uprising. The uprising was launched in Huizhou soon after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, and Sun Yat-sen personally organized this uprising. However, due to the failure to deliver the military supplies to the designated location on time, it also failed.

Although he failed twice, Sun Yat-sen was not discouraged. In the following years, he led the struggle against the monarchists, defeated their views, and at the same time, he traveled abroad to raise funds for the revolution among the overseas Chinese and to gain more support. To develop the revolutionary organization, he went to Japan in 1905. There, he merged the Xingzhonghui with two other anti-Qing organizations (Huang Xing and Song Jiaoren's Huaxinghui and Xu Xilin and Zhang Binglin's Guangfuhui) to form the Tongmenghui. Thus, a united front organization of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie revolutionary groups was born, with the program of overthrowing the Qing court, establishing a bourgeois democratic republic, and equalizing land rights.

In 1906, more than 6,000 coal miners in the border areas of Lianyuan, Liling, and Pingxiang counties staged another uprising. These miners joined the Tongmenghui shortly before taking up arms. One of the leaders, Liu Dao, was captured and martyred in this uprising.

In 1907, Sun Yat-sen set up a leadership organization in neighboring Vietnam (then called Annam, a French colony) and launched four uprisings. Two were in the eastern part of Guangdong Province, one in the southwestern part of Guangdong Province, and another led by Sun Yat-sen himself to attack the Friendship Pass (now renamed "Friendship Pass") near Vietnam in Guangxi Province. The revolutionary army captured three forts, but the reinforcements did not arrive, and they were forced to retreat.

In 1908, two more uprisings were launched in the southwestern part of Guangdong Province and in Hekou, Yunnan. But these uprisings also failed because, like many other times, the political aspect of the revolution was completely ignored. Relying solely on military means was bound to lead to failure.

To complete his mission, he had already experienced eight failures. Due to repeated requests from the Qing court, the French expelled Sun Yat-sen from Vietnam. He went to Singapore and in 1909 went to the United States to raise funds. In 1910, when he was still in the United States, his comrades attacked Guangzhou but suffered a heavy defeat. After returning to Singapore, Sun Yat-sen found that his comrades were discouraged due to repeated setbacks. He convened a meeting in Penang Island to rekindle everyone's revolutionary spirit and courage and to continue the struggle. The meeting also discussed future revolutionary strategies.

Due to the lack of revolutionary funds, Sun Yat-sen spent a lot of time and energy raising funds. He went to the United States again and carried out propaganda and fundraising among the overseas Chinese and students. When he was away, his comrades attempted to seize Guangdong Province, which was the uprising of the martyrs of Huanghuagang on March 29, 1911. Although the uprising seemed to have failed, in fact, due to the continuous attacks of the revolutionary forces, the Qing court's rule was increasingly shaken.

In 1911, Sun Yat-sen and his comrades launched the eleventh uprising. The result of this uprising was different from the previous ones, changing the course of Chinese history. On October 10, 1911 (the year of Xinhai), the armed forces led by the revolutionary party occupied Wuhan in the Wuhan Uprising. From then on, various provinces responded in support of the revolutionary movement. The Qing court, which was deeply hated by the people nationwide, was finally driven out, and the two-thousand-year-old feudal autocratic system came to an end. From the beginning of the revolution, Sun Yat-sen grasped the necessity of solving the main contradiction in the situation at that time in China, that is, to overthrow the feudal dynasty by force.

After the uprising army occupied Wuhan, Sun Yat-sen immediately returned to the country and was elected as the first president. However, his term was short because the real power was in the hands of the military led by Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai was a big warlord and bureaucrat who had been a slave of the Qing Dynasty until its abdication. With the support of conservatives and imperialists, Yuan Shikai forced Sun Yat-sen to resign and took over. Later, I once asked Sun Yat-sen why he resigned from the presidency in Nanjing. He told me that he had no revolutionary army and no revolutionary cadres. He regretted not organizing the most patriotic and reliable Chinese sailors. At that time, even one of Sun Yat-sen's close collaborators in the anti-Qing revolution, Wang Jingwei, was bought over by Yuan Shikai.

Yuan Shikai used his presidential power to establish a military dictatorship and even wanted to become an emperor. The Kuomintang (the predecessor of the Tongmenghui) was declared illegal, the parliament was dissolved, and many of Yuan's political opponents were assassinated. In 1913, Yuan sent troops south to attack the armies that had risen during the Xinhai Revolution. Sun Yat-sen wanted these armies to resist, but they all failed due to their weakness. Sun Yat-sen and many comrades fled to Japan.

The initial victories of the Xinhai Revolution were due to the support of the bourgeoisie, workers, peasants, and urban petty bourgeoisie. Its failure was due to the vacillation of the Kuomintang leadership (which was caused by its class composition), and the main reason was the failure to correctly handle the peasant question. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The national revolution needs a great upheaval in the countryside. The Xinhai Revolution did not have this upheaval, so it failed." The Xinhai Revolution did not reduce the oppression suffered by the peasants. On the contrary, after the revolution, the power fell into the hands of those who blindly obeyed the feudal class and imperialism, and they intensified the oppression of the peasants.

This means that the fundamental problem of China—overthrowing feudalism and imperialist rule—was not solved, and the revolutionary struggle must continue. Sun Yat-sen saw this and took action based on this understanding. His tenacious spirit became a model for all patriotic and revolutionary Chinese at that time. His spirit further awakened the people, making them realize the humiliating position of the country and the people and strengthening their determination to liberate the motherland with all their might.

In 1914, Sun Yat-sen established the Revolutionary Party of China in Japan. This new party split from the Kuomintang. Its establishment showed that Sun Yat-sen was dissatisfied with the Kuomintang's policy of compromise, which paved the way for Yuan Shikai. But this new party was still an alliance of representatives of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, the difference being that it insisted on anti-Yuan. Through this new party, Sun Yat-sen launched armed uprisings in Shanghai in 1914 and 1916, the second of which he secretly returned to the country to lead personally. Under his influence, the naval forces in Shanghai launched another revolutionary uprising. Just at this time, Yuan Shikai suddenly died, and other warlords rushed to seize his position.

In 1917, Sun Yat-sen led the uprising of naval vessels from Shanghai to Guangzhou. He formed an alliance with the southern warlords and established a government opposing the northern warlords. The parliament, which was dissolved by Yuan Shikai, was reconvened, and Sun Yat-sen was elected as the president of the Guangzhou Protection Government. He immediately planned and prepared for the Northern Expedition. In 1921, the Northern Expeditionary Army set out from Hunan and Guangxi. In 1922, the southern warlord Chen Jiongming colluded with the northern warlords to stage a rebellion, threatening the rear of the Northern Expeditionary Army. In 1924, the mercenary army of the "Guangzhou Commercial Corps," led by the comprador Chen Lianbo and subsidized by the British Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, opposed the Guangzhou government. Sun Yat-sen led the revolutionary army to defeat the enemy.

Under the unequal treaties, the customs of China were originally controlled by foreigners. When the Guangzhou Protection Government took over the customs, Britain, the United States, and even Portugal all sent warships into the Pearl River to threaten with cannon fire. Sun Yat-sen was not moved. He appealed to the British and American sailors, exposing the unjust actions of the British and American governments, and pointing out that their ancestors had also fought against tyranny and oppression. He tried to awaken the sailors' consciences. He told the American sailors that they should remember the principle of "no taxation without representation" and should remember that their ancestors had dumped British tea into the sea in Boston Harbor. As far as I can remember, these were the first batch of leaflets he personally drafted in English. For the matter of distributing leaflets, the British consul came to the Chinese government's location to protest, and Sun Yat-sen sternly rebuked him.

At that time, the two factions of the warlords in the north, Fengtian and Zhili, were fighting each other. Sun Yat-sen immediately mobilized the army and prepared to launch another Northern Expedition. After Feng Yuxiang overthrew the warlord "President" Cao Kun, he invited Sun Yat-sen to go north to discuss state affairs. Sun Yat-sen accepted the invitation, but soon after arriving in Tianjin, he fell seriously ill. On his sickbed, he received the representative of the warlord in Beijing, Duan Qirui. Duan insisted that the round-table conference invited by the northern warlords to discuss anti-imperialism should not be discussed. Sun Yat-sen angrily expressed that if so, he would rather return to Guangzhou and not preside over this "unification" conference. He said that the abolition of unequal treaties and resistance to imperialist aggression should be the main agenda of the conference. This was completely consistent with the position he publicly and clearly announced in his talk with the English "Yuebao" reporter before going north. In that talk, he said, "Imperialism... is not only the main obstacle to our country's realization of independence and freedom but also the strongest factor in the counter-revolutionary forces."

Just at this time, his liver disease worsened, and he could not walk when he entered Beijing. On March 12, 1925, an incurable disease took Sun Yat-sen's life. Before his death, he left a testament to those who would inherit his revolutionary cause. The head of the right-wing of the Kuomintang and the agent of imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek, betrayed his testament in 1927. These traitors continued to oppress the people and launched a civil war, delaying the liberation of the Chinese people by more than twenty years and bringing in the invasion of Japanese militarism and American imperialism, causing incalculable losses to the country's wealth and the lives of countless sons and daughters of the motherland. They made American imperialism still occupy our territory of Taiwan to this day.

Sun Yat-sen's testament was his Three Principles of the People and the Three Great Policies. This was developed in the process of his dedication to completing the bourgeois democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism in China. Chairman Mao once said, "For a hundred years, imperialism has oppressed China, and the Chinese people have been fighting against it. But it was only from Sun Yat-sen that we began to have a relatively clear bourgeois democratic revolution." Chairman Mao accurately evaluated Sun Yat-sen's contribution, pointing out that the Xinhai Revolution "had its victories and its failures." It was a victory because it abolished the court system and drove away the emperor, and it was a failure because it did not drive away imperialism and feudalism. Sun Yat-sen realized this and demanded the continuation of the revolution. In his will, he said, "The revolution is not yet successful, and comrades must still strive!"

Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to promoting the revolution. This is still worth learning from today. There are still two-thirds of the people in the world who have not been liberated. We must continue the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and the revolutionary struggle to build socialism and communism, so that our country can achieve modernization in all aspects and strive to reach the peak of science. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary aspirations were not limited to China. He paid special attention to the revolutions against imperialism in various countries. Since 1900, he has maintained close contact with revolutionary patriots from various Asian countries—Indians and Burmese fighting against British rule, Koreans fighting against Japanese rule, Vietnamese fighting against French rule, Indonesians fighting against Dutch rule, and Aginaldo and other patriots in the Philippines fighting against American imperialism. At the same time, he also had contact with Belgian and French socialists, including Jean Jaurès, who was assassinated during World War I for calling on European workers not to kill each other for the purposes of imperialism. He established all these relationships to serve the revolution in China and other countries. Foreign friends helped Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause with loans, communication, and the purchase of weapons, and Sun Yat-sen also helped their cause financially and in other ways. As for the friendship and fruitful communication and cooperation between Sun Yat-sen and Lenin, I have already mentioned it earlier.

Sun Yat-sen had another aspect worth learning from. To adapt himself politically to the needs of the current revolutionary tasks, he insisted on self-education. He never stopped exploring theoretically and practically, seeking the path to revolutionary victory, the liberation of China, and the equal status of China in the world, and the freedom of the Chinese people.

We may say that Sun Yat-sen's political maturity is concentrated in this question: in the long and tortuous process of revolutionary practice, he increasingly realized the importance of mastering armed forces and that "the first step is to combine the armed forces with the people, and the second step is to make the armed forces the people's armed forces." Today, in our view, this is a simple question. But when we evaluate Sun Yat-sen and his contribution to the Chinese revolution, we must start from the premise that the world and revolutionary practice have undergone tremendous changes in the hundred years since Sun Yat-sen's birth, especially in the past fifty years. Why must there be a revolution, what kind of revolution should be carried out, and how to carry out the revolution—on these questions, our current understanding comes from the successes and failures of our predecessors. They acted based on their inherited understanding of the laws of revolution; it was only when they encountered obstacles in applying these laws and could not achieve the expected results that they had to explore new laws. They paid a high price, but their goals led to our goals, so we think they are glorious even in defeat.

As for those who finally realized their mistakes and bravely and resolutely corrected these mistakes, they are even more glorious. Sun Yat-sen's later life and revolutionary activities were like this. In June 1924, when he spoke to the faculty and students of the Whampoa Military Academy, he said: "In the decades of revolutionary work, we have gained both successful experiences and failed lessons. The reason why the Chinese revolution has not been successful for so long is that we have not had our own revolutionary armed forces and a broad base of the people... Now, in order to complete our revolutionary mission, I have decided to reorganize the Kuomintang and establish our own revolutionary army... This is the purpose of establishing the Whampoa Military Academy."

Learning is a gradual process. Learning revolution is also like this. Only through step-by-step exploration can we understand what to do and how to do it. China in Sun Yat-sen's time was very complicated. The class contradictions in this semi-feudal, semi-colonial society, especially after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, had developed to a white-hot degree due to the rule of warlords and military division. And these warlords each had an imperialist country as their backer, with Japan, Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, Germany, and others all getting involved. Sun Yat-sen wanted to liberate the Chinese people from their suffering, but he did not yet understand that the people could only liberate themselves with their own hands, so he once tried to use one warlord against another.

This was a road full of painful failures, but the final result was to give Sun Yat-sen and other Chinese revolutionaries an important lesson. He seriously explored the causes of failure. When he found that the parties he established all lacked a solid foundation, he did not shrink back. Through strict self-examination of this issue and the help of many new friends, he began to see the light. He realized that he must follow Lenin's path, learn from Russia, and follow the path of the Communist Party of China in arousing the masses and leading the national revolution. The revolution could only rely on the most oppressed people, the masses of the people. After he realized this, he was no longer deceived by the beautiful facade of bourgeois democracy, and he saw through it as a trick. Today, the reactionaries try to deceive the people of the world, especially the youth, telling them not to make a revolution and not to believe in Marxism-Leninism, saying that these are all "outdated." They want to induce the people to believe that the revolution can be completed without a revolution! But more than forty years ago, Sun Yat-sen had already concluded that bourgeois democracy itself had been outdated for a hundred years, and in fact, the bourgeoisie had long abandoned it. The only solution is to carry out a revolution based on the masses.

In this way, Sun Yat-sen, in his later years, clearly saw the truth about the Chinese revolution. He was always like this, and as soon as he saw the truth, he took action. He welcomed the cooperation of the Communist Party of China and the assistance of the newly born Soviet Union. He worked hard to reorganize the party he led, aiming to arouse the masses and take revolutionary action. When some people in the Kuomintang refused to follow him, he told them with a firm attitude of principle: either revolution or retreat; if they did not retreat, he would retreat. Moreover, he openly declared that if he retreated, he would join the Communist Party of China and be with those who truly wanted China to enjoy freedom and equality in the world.

Regarding his revolutionary political program, Sun Yat-sen took action with the same determination. He re-interpreted his Three Principles of the People and added the Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants. At the first National Congress of the Kuomintang in 1924, he declared: The Three Principles of the People and the Three Great Policies as the foundation of the Chinese revolution are indivisible and unchangeable. Forty years ago, such a program was very radical, and to realize this program required severe and sustained struggle.

Chairman Mao pointed out very early on: "This Three Principles of the People of the Three Great Policies, the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, the new Three Principles of the People, the true Three Principles of the People, is the Three Principles of the People of the new democratic revolution, the development of the old Three Principles of the People, and the great contribution of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which was produced in the era when the Chinese revolution was part of the world socialist revolution." While pointing out the differences between Sun Yat-sen's program and the program of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao explained that the two were basically the same in the tasks of the democratic revolution. This made it possible for the Three Principles of the People and communism to form a united front and for the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which won the support of the people throughout the country and realized the Great Revolution of 1924-27. Then, Chiang Kai-shek abandoned Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary testament and betrayed the revolution, while the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, took on the responsibility of carrying the new democratic revolution to the end.

Sun Yat-sen, in his will, urged all revolutionaries to continue the struggle until victory. The Communist Party of China led the Chinese people to realize this will and far surpassed it. If Sun Yat-sen were still alive, he would be proud of the Communist Party of China uniting the people of the whole country and all nationalities, leading the people to achieve great successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and firmly upholding the truth of Marxism-Leninism in the current world.

The goals of Sun Yat-sen's lifelong struggle have been achieved and even surpassed. But his name and spirit still live in our hearts. We are proud of his forty years of selfless struggle. His words "We must awaken the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally" are still correct today.

Our people have achieved unprecedented unity, striving to develop production and scale new heights in science, education, and culture. With the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our socialist revolution has entered a deeper and broader new stage. In the severe struggle against imperialism, especially the main enemy of the people of all countries, American imperialism, our unity with the working people of the world and the unity with the oppressed nations and peoples are strengthening day by day. The world is presenting a great revolutionary situation. Sun Yat-sen's firmness and tenacity in the revolutionary struggle often inspire us. With an unshakable determination for our struggle goals, a strong belief in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and an infinite confidence in our strength to win victory, we, together with all those who strive for a world without human exploitation, without national oppression, and without racial discrimination, advance hand in hand in the struggle.

    孙中山——坚定不移、百折不挠的革命家
    宋庆龄
    在这纪念孙中山诞辰一百周年的时候，我想就这位中国人民伟大儿子的生平和活动，谈谈我的一些感想。
    他生在帝国主义垄断资本开始统治世界之前。他出生的时候，国内的封建王朝刚刚受到太平天国农民革命的震撼，我国人民还刚刚同资本主义国家发生接触。
      当他离开人间的时候，帝国主义力量正不可一世，欧洲列强处心积虑要瓜分我国领土，近邻日本的军国主义也不断威胁着我们整个国家的生存。国家被军阀们分割成几部分，他们各自直接或间接地同一个帝国主义国家相勾结，在他们割据的地区垄断军械弹药的进口。当时四分五裂的中国，已成为帝国主义肆意争夺的猎物。
    今天，中国发生了多么伟大的具有历史意义的变化！在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，中国人民已经搬掉了帝国主义侵略、封建统治和官僚资本垄断这三座大山。中国人民不但胜利地完成了新民主主义革命，并且在社会主义革命和建设中取得了光辉的成就。中国人民紧密地团结一致。我们的政治制度、社会组织和经济在本质上比西方资本主义国家先进，而帝国主义则开始瓦解，并且正面临着无可逃避的政治和经济危机。
    那末，我们现在为什么还要来纪念孙中山呢？我想，这是为了使我们永远怀念中国民主革命时期这位坚定不移、百折不挠的革命家，中国伟大的革命先行者。
    我想先谈一谈孙中山的性格。
    孙中山是一个有远大目光和深刻预见的人。因此，他的一生是一个顽强的革命者的一生。他一开始就不相信封建王朝，而随着革命的发展，他对人民则产生越来越大的信心。他看到了官场的腐败，统治者对人民作威作福、对帝国主义则俯首贴耳，于是他决心推翻清朝。同他成为鲜明对照的是一些他的同时代人如康有为、梁启超、严复等，他们虽然充分了解君主政体的种种弊端，但是不信任人民，不敢进行革命和建立共和政体。他们主张的是君主立宪。康有为后来甚至于参加了妄图拥戴清帝复辟的小集团。
    六十多年前，一九○五年七月，孙中山在对东京华侨和学生发表的演说中，驳斥了君主立宪的纲领。他说：“且世界立宪，亦必以流血得之，方能称为真立宪。同一流血，何不为直截了当之共和，而为此不完不备之立宪乎？”①孙中山有信心和勇气宣布这个主张，因为他坚信中国人民能够在较短的时间内超过日本，甚至西方资本主义国家。像梁启超这样的改良主义者却硬说中国人民只能模仿和追随西方，没有能力超过西方。在西方国家面前，梁启超和所有改良主义者简直是懦夫。
    当时的保守派和改良派嘲称孙中山为“孙大炮”。这只能说明他们自己鼠目寸光，缺乏勇气和信心，缺乏对永远要求进步的人民的同情。我们知道，理想和远见是干革命的必要前提。没有革命的理论，就不可能有革命。
    一个革命者，一个全心全意为人民利益奋斗的人，总是不知道疲倦的，总是把未来看作是光明的。列宁在一九一三年，早在他和孙中山开始通讯之前（这些信件由马尔林同志传递，他现仍住列宁格勒）就从革命精神和革命前景方面谈到了“落后的欧洲和先进的亚洲”。②列宁对孙中山是一个巨大的鼓舞。列宁对那时正在进行的中国革命的胜利也充满着信心。
    孙中山很了解中国的历史。他对封建制度下的剥削者和被剥削者有明确的看法。
    据马湘（马湘原为旅美华侨工人，后参加革命，自一九一六年起历任孙中山先生的卫士、卫士长、副官等职，直到中山先生逝世。）回忆，一九一六年在上海时，“有一次，我跟随先生步行至愚园路，他忽然指着路旁一幢幢的洋房对我说：‘你看！愚园路这一带地方，以前都是坟墓，现在都是华丽的洋房了。这些洋房都是我国军阀建筑的。他们割据地方，横征暴敛，开烟开赌，无恶不作，吸尽民脂民膏，来到这里盖起洋房，娶小老婆，打麻雀牌，饮洋酒和吃大菜，弄得工人农民都吃不饱，穿不暖。这样，中国还能不亡国？所以我们非打倒军阀不可。’”③
    一九二一年十月，孙中山到广西南宁视察时，曾在一次群众大会上讲话。他对听众说：“革命就是要使工人、农民以及各界人士都过好生活……你们是主人，省长是仆人。仆人必定要做到使主人满意，才是一个好省长、一个好仆人。马（君武）省长现在首先要把陆荣廷、谭浩明等（本省军阀）存在上海外国银行的现款设法取回，连同他们在省内的产业一齐拿出来分给大家，使大家有衣穿、有鞋着。”④
    一九二三年在广州时，有一天他去白云山，一群衣衫破旧的农民跟踪而至。他对他们说：“我刚才所见山下附近的乡村，不是茅棚便是泥墙小屋，可以料定你们的生计是不充裕的。这原因都是地权制度不好，耕田的人每年要付出很大的田租，这个问题我一定要把它解决。”⑤
    从他个人生活的简朴，我们可以看到孙中山的伟大的另一方面。他没有置过一座住宅。寓居上海时，他先住在环龙路六十三号，这是租赁的房子，以后搬到莫利爱路二十九号，就是现在作为中山故居的地方。这所小宅是华侨国民党员送给他的。
    上海永安公司是澳洲华侨创办的。经理郭彪有一次派人送给孙中山一件皮大衣。当时把这件事报告孙中山的马湘回忆道：“先生惊讶地说：‘上海不算十分冷，回广东更不冷，我又不到北方去，我不受他的，你拿回去还给他吧！’”⑥两天以后，郭彪来见孙中山，孙中山感谢他的好意，但直截了当地说，他没有理由接受这样奢侈的礼物。
      一九二四年，孙中山在广州讲三民主义，讲演的地点是广东大学。每次都有十多个干部陪他从大元帅府出发到珠江对岸，再乘三辆汽车前往。孙中山打听了一下，知道汽车来回四五里路要花十五元钱。以后他就不坐车，同干部们一起步行而去。
      孙中山的毕生好学精神，是所有认识他的人都称道和钦佩的。一九一三年到一九一六年，他在东京。老同盟会员仇鳌回忆道：“他的寓所内，四壁图书，琳琅满目，十三经、二十四史、中外政治经济书籍、各种地图，应有尽有。他经常读书，手不释卷；融会贯通，能得要领。”⑦
    我自己记得，他只要有一点空，就在书房里把大地图铺在地上，手里拿着深色铅笔和橡皮，在上面标绘出铁路、河道、海港等等。他订阅了一种英国出版的航运年鉴，知道很多关于船只吨位、吃水等这一类的事情。有一次他乘巡洋舰视察海宁时，告诉大副，航道水浅，把船靠外行驶。但这位大副自以为他更熟悉情况，结果船搁了浅。
    最后，我想用菲律宾作家马利亚诺·庞塞的一段话来说明，孙中山很早就明确地看到亚洲各国的革命问题是一个整体。庞塞是一八九九——一九○○年间在日本同孙中山结识的，当时菲律宾刚刚摆脱西班牙殖民统治的桎梏，正在为反抗掠夺成性的美帝国主义而进行剧烈的武装斗争。庞塞写道：“孙中山熟悉菲律宾的时局，以最大的兴趣密切注视它的发展。他曾以极大的热情研究里萨尔、德尔·皮拉尔等我国最伟大的人物的事迹。……在孙中山看来，远东各国的问题是如此密切关联，要各别了解每个国家的问题，必须把这些国家作为一个整体来进行全面的探讨。……因此，孙中山是‘东方青年协会’的最热心的赞助者之一。这个协会是由朝鲜、中国、日本、印度、暹罗和菲律宾等国留学生在东京组织的……孙中山对有关远东的一切问题都表现出真正的关心。他研究这些问题，并且帮助有关方面找出解决的办法。”庞塞还引述了他和孙中山在一八九九年的通信，讨论反帝武装斗争的经费和武器问题。
    类似这样的接触是一直不断的。我记得，在一九一五年及其后一段时期，我们在东京的寓所里经常坐满来自亚洲和世界各地的革命者。
    下面我再谈一谈孙中山生平的一些经历，以及这些经历对他一生的影响。
    孙中山出生在一个贫农家庭，有时饭不够吃，只好以甘薯充饥。童年时代，当地说书人常在晚上讲关于太平天国和其他农民起义事迹的故事，使他听得入迷。他的家庭出身、他和下层被压迫人民的共同生活，以及他所听到的人民企图挣脱压迫者的斗争故事，在他的思想上留下了不可磨灭的印象。以后的发展证明，这些童年的经历对于他决心终生献身革命起了决定的影响。
    他在国内上不起学。因为他有一个哥哥在夏威夷务农，他才有机会到国外念一点书。虽然他身处异地长时期与祖国分离，但他的思想感情并没有一刻同祖国分开。当离开檀香山回国时，他的思想已很进步，认为中国的唯一出路就是推翻清朝帝制。在制定一个政治纲领作为传播革命思想的基础时，他提出了第一个口号：“神圣的权利不是永恒的！”
    在着手联络同志时，他考虑到为了生存必须有一种职业来掩护他的革命活动。他选择了医生作为职业。他一方面在广州博济医学校就学，一方面鼓吹革命。在学校里，他结识了郑士良，郑热烈赞同孙中山的主张。他们两人开始联络更多的青年参加革命，并不断讨论斗争的策略。一年后，孙中山转学到香港西医书院，因为这里的课程更完备些。在香港，他又结识了陈少白、尤少纨、杨鹤龄和陆皓东等战友。
    毕业后，孙中山在澳门开业，根据原定计划，他的主要目的仍然是进行革命。他组织的秘密团体“兴中会”于一八九四年在檀香山正式宣告成立。同时又在香港和广州分别设立“乾亨行”和“农学会”，这两个组织事实上就是革命的领导机关。
    清廷的无能导致甲午战争的失败。孙中山不能再等待了，他感到革命，只有革命才能拯救祖国。发动第一次打击的时机到了。一八九五年十月，孙中山准备发动对广州清吏衙门的武装进攻，但遭到了第一次失败。原来打算给革命党人的六百支手枪在船上为清吏截获，他的两位亲密的同志陆皓东、朱贵全遇难，另有七十个同志被捕入狱。清廷下令缉捕孙中山，他逃出魔掌，潜往夏威夷，以后又到美国、英国及欧洲大陆各处。
    一到海外，孙中山立即恢复革命活动。他到处在华侨和留学生中间进行宣传和组织工作。从一八九六年到一八九九年，他访问了有中国人在那里生活和学习的一切欧洲中心城市——伦敦、巴黎、布鲁塞尔、日内瓦、柏林。在宣传民族主义时，他觉得人们是很听得进去的。满族统治中国虽已两百多年，在华侨中间，汉族的民族意识并未消灭，因为一六四四年明朝亡后，一些学者逃亡海外，建立了秘密组织，把民族意识一代代传留下来。孙中山从华侨那里不但得到了对他的主张的道义上的支持，而且得到了大量款项来支持他推翻清朝政府的事业。
    就在这一海外活动时期，孙中山根据他当时的理解，制定了他的民族主义、民权主义和民生主义。他知道马克思和恩格斯，他也听到了关于列宁和俄国工人革命活动的消息。早在那个时候，社会主义就对他发生了吸引力。他敦促留学生研究马克思的《资本论》和《共产党宣言》并阅读当时的社会主义书刊。
    在进行这些活动时，孙中山的生活是艰苦的，而且常常冒着生命危险。但他对革命的信念从不动摇，也从未放松过寻找机会给中国人民的压迫者以打击。一八九六年十月，当他在伦敦进行革命活动时，曾经险遭毒手。十月十一日，他途经中国公使馆，被使馆人员认出后遭到绑架。清朝官员把他严密地囚禁在公使馆里，等有了船就送回国去斩首。他唯一能接触到的人是每天给他送水的一个年老的女佣人。
    幸运的是，不久前孙中山在檀香山时，有一次在路上步行，看见一辆马车迎面而来，想不到坐在车里的竟是他在香港时的老师詹姆士·康德黎医生夫妇。他们告诉他，他们已经退休，正在回国途中，还给他留下了他们在伦敦的地址。
      孙中山经过多次尝试之后，终于赢得那个年老的女佣人的同意，送一张字条给康德黎医生。康得讯后立即设法营救。孙中山被释后，就同这些英国朋友住在一起。但危险并没有过去，他无论走到什么地方，背后总有人钉梢。有好多次，他不得不化装，以摆脱敌人的追踪。
    一八九九年，他取道往日本，积极准备第二次起义。起义是一九○○年义和团运动爆发后不久在惠州发动的，孙中山亲自组织了这次起义，但因军械未能按时运到指定地点，又告失败。
      虽然失败了两次，孙中山毫不气馁。在以后的几年里，他领导了对保皇党的论战，击败了他们的观点，他同时在国外到处奔走，在华侨中为革命活动筹募款项并争取更多的支持。为了发展革命组织，他在一九○五年到日本。在那里他把兴中会同另外两个反清团体（黄兴和宋教仁领导的华兴会以及徐锡麟和章炳麟所属的光复会）合并组成了同盟会。这样就产生了一个资产阶级和小资产阶级革命团体的统一战线组织，它的纲领是推翻清廷、建立资产阶级民主共和国、平均地权。
    一九○六年，浏阳、醴陵和萍乡三县交界处六千多煤矿工人举行了另一次起义，这些矿工是在拿起武器前不久加入同盟会的。领导人之一刘道一在这次起义中被捕牺牲。
    一九○七年，孙中山在紧邻中国的越南（当时称作安南，是法国殖民地）设置了领导机关，发动了四次起义。两次是在广东省东部，一次在广东省的西南部，另一次由孙中山亲自领导攻打靠近越南的广西省镇南关（现改名为“友谊关”）。革命军夺取了三座炮台，但援军迟迟不至，又被迫撤退。
    一九○八年，在广东省西南部和云南河口又举行了两次起义，但这些起义又失败了，因为像在其他许多时候一样，完全忽视了革命的政治方面。单纯依靠军事手段，不可避免地要导致失败。
    为了完成他的使命，他已经历八次失败了。由于清廷屡次要求，法国人把孙中山逐出越南。他到了新加坡，一九○九年再赴美国筹款。一九一○年，当他还在美国的时候，他的同志攻打广州但遭到惨重失败。孙中山赶回新加坡后，发现同志们因屡受挫折，意气消沉。他在槟榔屿召集了一次会议，来重新鼓起大家的革命精神和勇气，把斗争继续进行下去，会上并讨论了未来的革命策略。
    由于革命经费常感不足，孙中山把很多时间和精力用于筹款。他又去美国，在华侨和留学生中进行宣传和筹款工作。他不在的时候，他的同志们又企图夺取广东省，这就是一九一一年三月二十九日黄花岗烈士的起义。起义虽然看来又失败了，但事实上由于革命力量不断的进攻，清廷统治日趋动摇。
    一九一一年，孙中山和同志们举行第十一次起义。这次起义的结果与前不同，它改变了中国历史的进程。一九一一年（辛亥年）十月十日，革命党领导的武装力量，在武昌起义中，占领了武汉三镇。自此以后，各省纷纷响应，支持革命运动。为全国人民深恶痛绝的清廷终于最后被赶下台去，两千年封建专制政体至此告终。孙中山从开始革命的时候起，就抓住了解决当时中国情况下存在的主要矛盾的必要性，那就是用武力推翻封建王朝的统治。
    起义军占领武汉之后，孙中山立即回国，当选为首任大总统。但他任职时间很短，因为真正的权力落在以袁世凯为首的军人手中。袁世凯是一个大军阀、大官僚，直到清廷退位他一直是清朝的奴才。在保守分子和帝国主义的支持下，袁世凯迫使孙中山辞职，由袁继任。后来我曾问过孙中山，他为什么在南京辞去总统职位。他告诉我，他没有革命军队，也没有革命的干部。他很后悔，没有把他认为最爱国、最可靠的中国海员组织起来。当时，甚至于孙中山在反清革命中亲密的合作者之一汪精卫也被袁世凯收买了过去。
    袁世凯利用总统职权建立起军事独裁，后来居然还想当皇帝。孙中山领导的国民党（它的前身即同盟会）被宣布为非法，国会被解散，许多袁的政敌被暗杀。一九一三年，袁派兵南下，进攻那些在辛亥革命中崛起的军队。孙中山想使这些军队坚持抵抗，但它们都因势单力薄而告失败。孙中山和许多同志避居日本。
    辛亥革命初期所取得的胜利是由于资产阶级取得了工人、农民和城市小资产阶级的支持。它的失败是由于国民党领导的摇摆不定（这是它的阶级成分造成的），主要原因则是由于未能正确处理农民问题。毛主席指出：“国民革命需要一个大的农村变动。辛亥革命没有这个变动，所以失败了。”（《湖南农民运动考察报告》）辛亥革命丝毫没有减轻农民所受的压迫。相反地，在革命后，政权落到了那些一味听命于封建阶级和帝国主义的人们手里，他们加紧了对农民的压迫。
    这就是说，中国的根本问题——推翻封建主义和帝国主义统治——并没有得到解决，革命斗争必须继续。孙中山看到这一点，并且根据这一认识采取了行动。他这种坚韧不拔的精神，成为当时一切爱国的、革命的中国人学习的榜样。他这种精神进一步唤醒了人民，使他们认识到国家和人民所处的屈辱地位，并加强了他们不遗余力地解放祖国的决心。
      一九一四年，孙中山在日本建立中华革命党。这个新党是从国民党分裂出来的。它的成立说明孙中山不满国民党的妥协政策，正是这种政策为袁世凯扫清了道路。但这个新党仍然是资产阶级和小资产阶级代表的联盟，所不同的是它坚持反袁。通过这个新党，孙中山在一九一四年和一九一六年两次在上海发动武装起义，第二次是他秘密回国亲自领导的。在他的影响下，在上海的海军部队发动了另一次革命起义。正在这时，袁世凯猝毙，其他军阀纷起争夺他的权位。
      一九一七年，孙中山率领起义的海军舰只由上海去广州。他同南方军阀结成联盟，并建立了一个反对北方军阀的政府。被袁世凯宣布解散的国会重新召开，选举孙中山为广州护法政府的大总统。他立即筹划和准备北伐。一九二一年，北伐军自湘桂出动。一九二二年，南方军阀陈炯明勾结北方军阀进行叛变，使北伐军的后方受到威胁。一九二四年，受英国汇丰银行津贴、由买办陈廉伯率领的雇佣军广州“商团”反对广州政府。孙中山领导革命军队打败了敌军。
      在不平等条约下，中国海关原来都由外国人控制。当广州护法政府接管海关时，英国、美国、甚至葡萄牙都调集兵舰开入珠江，以炮轰相威胁。孙中山不为所动。他对英美水手发出呼吁，揭露英美政府的非正义行为，指出他们自己的祖先也曾为抵抗暴政压迫而斗争。他努力唤醒水手们的良心。他对美国水手们说，他们应该记得“没有代表权就不纳税”的原则，应该记得他们的祖先曾在波士顿港口把英国人迫使他们接受的印度茶倒进海中。就我记忆所及，这是他亲自用英文起草的第一批传单。为了散发传单这件事情，英国领事曾到中国政府所在地来提出抗议，孙中山严厉地训斥了他一顿。
    这时，北方奉直两系军阀交战，自相残杀。孙中山立即动员军队，准备再度北伐。冯玉祥推翻了军阀
  “总统”曹锟后，邀请孙中山北上，共商国事。孙中山接受了邀请，但抵天津不久即告病重。在病床上，他接见了当时占据着北京的军阀段祺瑞的代表。段坚持在北方军阀邀请孙中山参加的圆桌会议上，不谈反帝。孙中山怒不可遏地表示，如果这样，他宁愿回广州，不主持这次“统一”会议。他说，废除不平等条约和抵抗帝国主义侵略应该是会议的主要议程。这同他在北上前对英文《粤报》记者谈话中所公开和明确宣布的立场是完全一致的。他在那篇谈话中说，“帝国主义……不仅为我国实现独立自由的主要障碍，而且是反革命势力中最强大的因素。”
    就在这时，他的肝病越重了，进北京时已不能步行。一九二五年三月十二日，不治之症夺去了孙中山的生命。在逝世之前，他给继承他的革命事业的人留下了遗训。国民党内右派和帝国主义代理人的总头目蒋介石，在一九二七年背叛了他的遗训。这些叛徒从此成为历史的罪人，他们继续压迫人民并发动内战，使中国人民的解放推迟了二十多年，并且引来了日本军国主义和美帝国主义的侵略，使国家财富受到无可计量的损失，千千万万祖国的儿女丧失了宝贵的生命。他们使美帝国主义至今仍霸占着我国领土台湾。
    孙中山的遗训就是他的三民主义和三大政策。这是他在致力于完成中国反帝反封建的资产阶级民主革命的过程中发展而成的。毛主席曾说，一百年来帝国主义压迫中国，中国人民一直坚持反抗，“但是从孙中山先生开始，才有比较明确的资产阶级民主革命。”（《青年运动的方向》）毛主席对孙中山的贡献作了精确的估价，指出辛亥革命“有它胜利的地方，也有它失败的地方”。说它胜利是因为它废除了宫廷制度赶跑了皇帝，说它失败是因为它没有赶跑帝国主义和封建主义。孙中山认识到这一点，并要求继续革命。他在遗嘱中说，“革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力！”
    孙中山一生致力于推动革命。这一点今天仍然值得我们学习。世界上还有三分之二的人民没有获得解放，我们必须坚持反对帝国主义的革命斗争，坚持为建设社会主义和共产主义而进行的革命斗争，使我国在各方面实现现代化，并努力攀登科学高峰。孙中山对革命的抱负并不限于中国。他对各国反对帝国主义的革命特别注意。从一九○○年以来，他同亚洲各国的民族革命志士保持密切的联系——为反对英国统治而斗争的印度人和缅甸人、反对日本统治的朝鲜人、反对法国统治的越南人、反对荷兰统治的印度尼西亚人以及在菲律宾反抗美帝国主义的阿吉纳尔多和其他爱国者。同时，他也同比利时和法国的社会党人有联系，包括在第一次世界大战期间因号召欧洲工人不要为帝国主义的目的互相残杀而遇刺的让·饶勒斯。他建立所有这些关系都是为中国及各国的革命服务的。外国友人用贷款、通信联络、购运军火等行动帮助孙中山的革命事业，孙中山也在财政上和其他方面帮助他们的事业。至于孙中山和列宁相互之间的友谊和富有成果的通讯和合作，我在前面已经谈到过了。
    孙中山还有另一方面值得我们学习。为了使自己在政治上适应当前革命任务的需要，他坚持不懈地进行自我教育。他不停地从理论和实践上进行探索，寻找引向革命胜利、中国获得解放以及使中国在国际上取得平等地位、中国人民得到自由的道路。
    我们也许可以说，孙中山政治上的成熟集中表现在这样一个问题上：在长期而曲折的革命实践过程中，他越来越深刻地认识到，掌握武装的重要性，必须“第一步使武力与国民相结合，第二步使武力为国民之武力”。今天在我们看来，这是一个简单的问题。但我们在估价孙中山及其对中国革命的贡献时，必须从这样一个前提出发，即整个世界和革命实践在孙中山诞生后的一百年、特别是最近的五十年中，已经发生了巨大的变化。为什么必须革命，应该进行什么样的革命，怎样进行革命——在这些问题上，我们今天的认识来自我们的前人成功和失败的经验。他们当时是根据他们所继承下来的对革命规律的认识行事的；只是在运用这些规律碰了壁，不能得到预期的结果时，他们才不得不去探寻新的规律。他们付出了很高的代价，但他们的目标导向我们的目标，所以我们认为，他们是虽败犹荣的。
    至于那些最后认识了自己的错误，而且勇敢地、坚决地改正这些错误的人，就显得更加光荣。孙中山晚年的生活和革命活动正是这样。一九二四年六月，他对黄埔军官学校的教职员和学生讲话时曾说：“在几十年的革命事业中，既取得了成功的经验，也取得了失败的教训。中国革命所以迟迟不能成功的原因，就是没有自己的革命武装，没有广大人民的基础……现在为了完成我们革命的使命，所以我才下定决心改组国民党，建立自己的革命军队……这就是创办黄埔军校的宗旨。”⑧
    学习是一个逐步前进的过程。学习革命也是这样。只有经过一步一步的摸索，我们才能懂得应该做什么、应该怎样去做。孙中山时代的中国是十分复杂的。这个半封建半殖民地社会的阶级矛盾，特别是在清朝被推翻之后，由于军阀统治和军事割据发展到白热化的程度。而这些军阀又各有一个帝国主义国家作为后台，日本、英国、美国、法国、比利时、德国等都插手进来。孙中山要把中国人民从苦难中解放出来，但还不懂得人民只有用自己的双手才能赢得解放，因此他曾企图利用一个军阀反对另一个军阀。
    这是一条充满惨痛失败的道路，但最后的结果却是给了孙中山和其他中国革命者一个重要的教训。他对失败的原因进行了严肃的探讨。当他发现他所建立的政党都缺乏坚实基础时，他并不畏缩。通过对这一问题的严格的自我检查和许多新朋友的帮助，他开始看到了光明。他认识到，必须走列宁的道路，以俄为师，走中国共产党唤起民众、领导国民革命的道路。革命只能依靠那些最迫切要求解放的人，即被压迫的人民群众。他明白了这一点以后，就不再为资产阶级民主那一套漂亮的装饰所迷惑了，他看穿了这不过是骗局。今天，反动派力图欺骗全世界人民，特别是青年，叫他们不要搞革命，不要相信马克思列宁主义，说这些都已经“过时”了。他们妄想诱使人民相信，革命是可以通过不革命而完成的！但四十多年前孙中山已经得出结论，资产阶级民主本身已过时了一百年，而且实际上资产阶级自己也早把它抛掉了。唯一的解决办法就是进行以群众为基础的革命。
    这样，孙中山到了晚年清楚地看到了关于中国革命的真理。他总是这样，一旦看清楚了真理就立即行动起来。他欢迎中国共产党的合作和新生的苏联的援助。他全力进行改组他所领导的政党，目的是要唤起民众，采取革命行动。当国民党内有人拒绝跟他走的时候，他以坚强的原则性态度告诉他们：要末革命要末就退出；如果他们不退出，他就退出。而且他公开表明，如果他退出，就去加入中国共产党，和那些真正要使中国在世界上享有自由和平等的人在一起。
    关于他的革命的政治纲领，孙中山以同样的决心采取行动。他重新解释了他的三民主义，并且增加了联俄、联共和扶助农工三大政策。在一九二四年中国国民党第一次全国代表大会上，他声明：三民主义和三大政策作为中国革命的基础是不可分割的，也是不容改变的。四十年前，这样一个纲领是很激进的，要实现这个纲领需要进行严峻的、持续的斗争。
    毛主席很早就指出：“这种三大政策的三民主义，革命的三民主义，新三民主义，真三民主义，是新民主主义的三民主义，是旧三民主义的发展，是孙中山先生的大功劳，是在中国革命作为社会主义世界革命一部分的时代产生的。”（《新民主主义论》）在指出孙中山的纲领和中国共产党的纲领不同之处的同时，毛主席说明，两者在民主革命的任务上，是基本上相同的。这为三民主义和共产主义结成统一战线以及第一次国共合作提供了可能，这种合作赢得了全国人民的支持并且实现了一九二四——二七年的大革命。接着，蒋介石抛弃了孙中山的革命遗训，背叛了革命，而中国共产党在毛泽东主席领导下却负起了把新民主主义革命进行到底的重担。
    孙中山在遗嘱中要求所有革命者继续斗争，直到胜利。中国共产党领导中国人民实现了这一遗志，并远远超过了它。如果孙中山还健在，他会为中国共产党团结全国人民和全国各民族、领导人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得巨大成就并在当前世界上坚持马克思列宁主义真理的坚决立场而感到骄傲。
    孙中山一生奋斗的目标已经实现并且已经超过了。但他的名字和他的精神仍然活在我们心中。我们为他四十年的忘我斗争而感到骄傲。他的遗言“必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族”，今天听来仍然是正确的。
    我国人民实现了空前的团结，鼓足干劲发展生产和攀登科学、教育和文化的新高峰。随着无产阶级文化大革命的开展，我国的社会主义革命进入了一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。我们在反对帝国主义、特别是各国人民的主要敌人美帝国主义的严峻斗争中，同全世界劳动人民的团结，同被压迫民族和被压迫人民的团结正在日益加强。全世界呈现着一片大好革命形势。孙中山在革命斗争中表现出来的坚定性和坚韧性经常鼓舞着我们。怀着对我们的奋斗目标的不可动摇的决心，对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的坚强信念以及对我们赢得胜利的力量的无限信心，我们同一切为了实现一个没有人剥削人、没有民族压迫、没有种族歧视的世界而努力的人们，在斗争中携手前进。
