Recently, the members of Flowing Camel Village Brigade in Xizhuang Commune, Ding County, Hebei Province, held a meeting to discuss their experiences in studying and applying the "Three Articles" (Quotations from Chairman Mao). Everyone agreed that only by studying and applying them in the midst of struggle, and by earnestly transforming one's thoughts, can one truly master Mao Zedong Thought and see immediate results. They said that in recent years, by persistently studying and applying in the midst of struggle, repeatedly studying and applying, the more one studies, the more one understands, and the more one understands, the more one is transformed. The sandy land has been turned into a granary. Below are the summaries of some of the speeches by cadres and members:

**Aligning Mao Zedong's Teachings with One's Own Thoughts**

Old livestock keeper Zhen Xizhen said: When I first studied the "Three Articles," I was very happy. The livestock were well-fed, and I collected manure every day. I thought the brigade leader would surely praise me. But when I wasn't praised, I felt discouraged and didn't clean the pens on time or feed the livestock properly. The members criticized me for having personal motives, but I didn't admit it.

The brigade organized the members to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and it hit me hard. Chairman Mao said: "Some people, after doing a little good, think they have done a great deed and like to boast, fearing that others won't know." I pondered over these words and compared them with my own thoughts. Once I did, I realized my mistake. Studying from the standpoint of personal interests, how could I study well and apply it? Raising livestock is for the revolution, not for praise. Studying with personal motives is something one can never do well. Afterwards, I studied "In Service of the People" and decided to transform my thoughts. This summer, two of the brigade's donkeys gave birth to foals. One foal didn't have enough milk, so I fed it gruel. The other foal had milk, so I let both foals drink from one donkey. When the milk wasn't enough, I fed them the rice I brought from home. Because my thoughts had improved, the more I studied, the more energetic I became, and I no longer felt discouraged about work.

Thirteen Brigade accountant Zhen Shuanbao said: This summer, our brigade had a good harvest, and I was happy to report the actual yield to the higher authorities. Some people said I was currying favor with the higher authorities; others said I was "not smart." At that time, I had a struggle in my mind: Should I hide some of the yield, which would be dishonest to the country, or not hide it and face unpleasant remarks? What should I do? I thought of Chairman Mao's words: "Don't think of yourself first in everything you do." I decided to report the actual yield. Some people with heavy personal motives were not satisfied, so I guided everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and criticized those with heavy personal motives. I said: We listened to Chairman Mao's words and achieved this harvest; if we don't tell the truth to the country, how can we be honest to Chairman Mao! After I said this, those with heavy personal motives made self-criticisms.

**Focusing on the "Application"**

Brigade Communist Youth League secretary Zhen Yingmin said: For a long time, I was puzzled: I did many good deeds, but the masses always had opinions about me. What was the reason? According to Chairman Mao's teachings, I seriously thought about it and found the root cause: When doing heavy work, I would take the lead for a moment but soon slack off and do lighter work; sometimes I would do a good deed and boast about it, wanting others to know. Chairman Mao said: "Some people, after doing a little good, think they have done a great deed and like to boast, fearing that others won't know." Isn't this exactly what I did? Although I memorized many of Chairman Mao's quotations, I still acted against his teachings when doing things, because I didn't focus on the "application"! Understanding this, I paid attention to studying and applying. After studying Chairman Mao's teaching of "picking the heavier burden," I took on heavy and dirty work like watering the fields, turning the waterwheel, and cleaning the manure pits. When the brigade leader gave me light work, I refused. After doing this for more than half a year, the members said: Yingmin has finally blended in with us this year. I realized that to study Chairman Mao's works well, one must study earnestly, apply diligently, and dare to suffer for the revolution.

Thirteen Brigade women's team leader Yang Lingyan said: This spring, I was elected as the women's team leader, but I felt I couldn't do it because I was illiterate and couldn't speak well, so I wanted to pass it on to someone else. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I realized my thoughts were wrong. Chairman Mao said: "Many people are irresponsible in their work, picking the light and avoiding the heavy, pushing the heavy burden to others, and thinking of themselves first in everything." Isn't this exactly what I was doing? I thought: Being a team leader has difficulties, but should I face the difficulties or avoid them? This is a question of being revolutionary or not. I made up my mind: I will listen to Chairman Mao's words and face the difficulties! After starting the work, there were indeed many difficulties. I couldn't take notes at meetings, and I couldn't remember a few sentences after listening; I couldn't read Chairman Mao's books because I was illiterate. What should I do? At a meeting, I heard another quotation from Chairman Mao: "In the world, the most feared thing is the word 'serious.' The Communist Party is the most serious." After pondering over these words, I realized: Studying also requires seriousness. First, let others teach me, and I will work hard to memorize; after memorizing, I will compare it with the book, learn to write, and learn to recognize characters. When encountering difficulties, I would review Chairman Mao's teachings and persist seriously. After more than two hundred days, looking back, I was amazed. An illiterate person, after this period of effort, can now read the "Three Articles," take simple notes at meetings, and help members study Chairman Mao's works. Through this, I deeply realized that in the world, the most feared thing is indeed the word "serious"! As long as one works seriously, one can understand and apply it.

**Eliminating Personal Motives to Apply Seriously**

First Brigade leader Zhen Chouhuo said: After our brigade harvested peanuts, a cadre led a few members to gather peanut leaves, putting the picked peanuts into their own pockets. I saw this and was about to speak up, but my heart wavered. I thought: If I speak up, I might offend people; if I don't, I know this is wrong. At this time, I thought of Chairman Mao's words in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "We should all learn from his selfless spirit." Isn't fearing to offend people having personal motives? I then confidently pointed out their mistakes to them. Some people were not happy, so I propagated Chairman Mao's teachings to them, and everyone realized their mistakes. I realized that studying Chairman Mao's works, one must eliminate personal motives to apply seriously.

Thirteen Brigade female member Zhen Chengduan said: When studying "In Service of the People," seeing everyone's enthusiasm, I also expressed my willingness to contribute to the revolution. The members elected me as the manure collector, and I agreed at that time. But when I actually started, my thoughts changed, feeling that this job was dirty, and I wanted to quit. But I was also afraid of being laughed at. At this time, the instructor helped me study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "Many people are irresponsible in their work, picking the light and avoiding the heavy, pushing the heavy burden to others, and thinking of themselves first in everything." After hearing these words, I thought: Cleaning manure is a dirty job, and if I don't do it, someone else has to do it. Isn't this pushing the heavy burden to others? After eliminating personal motives, I not only cleaned the manure but also made high-temperature compost, mixed the manure soup, and collected urine from every household, determined to be a person beneficial to the people. The members praised me, saying I had turned from a "delicate girl" into a "good girl."

Work points recorder Zhen Maosheng said: Regarding the work points for cleaning manure in our brigade, the members had a debate for a while. Some members said: "Those who clean manure are careless and unclear." After an investigation, it was found that some manure collectors were lazy, calculating by the bucket and not caring about the quality, resulting in those with personal motives benefiting. I wanted to raise this issue, but I also thought: I am in charge of work points, and this is not my responsibility. Should I manage it or not? Thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, I decided not to think from a personal interest standpoint and worked with the manure collectors to find the quality standards, reasonably evaluate, and the members were satisfied, and those with personal motives also made self-criticisms.

**Continuously Studying and Applying**

Livestock keeper Zhen Jinmang said: To study Chairman Mao's works well, one must study and apply endlessly, find gaps endlessly, and do good deeds endlessly. Last spring, three of our brigade's livestock were weak, and I was appointed as the livestock keeper. I saw this and scratched my head. What should I do?

At this time, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people. I felt that as a Communist Party member, feeding the livestock well is serving the people. Chairman Mao also said: "The more difficult the place, the more one should go, this is a good comrade." Just like this, I took on the task and carefully fed them according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "seeking perfection." After a few months, I fed the few livestock to be fat and strong, and I felt sweeter than eating sugar!

After the work reached this level, the workload decreased. My mother said: "You should find some time to do other work in the brigade and earn more work points." Mother's words made me hesitate. But after picking up the "Three Articles" to study, I thought: In everything, one cannot only think of oneself. The workload is less, and one should still find work for the collective. I then started to collect manure vigorously. But sometimes I was still idle. This is not good! Serving the people wholeheartedly, one cannot be idle. The brigade bought fifteen pigs, and I became the pig keeper. I went to the fields to dig weeds and collect manure, going empty-handed, and thought: Why not bring a few sheep to graze? I then became the shepherd. Later, the brigade bought a group of chickens, and I became the poultry keeper. One person became five or six, creating wealth for the collective.

The members of our brigade often sing: "Chairman Mao's book is what I love to read, studying it ten thousand times with effort..." It is exactly like this, studying once increases knowledge, increases gains, the "Three Articles" are forever the "New Three Articles."

    去掉一个“私”字　突出一个“公”字
    ——流驼庄大队干部、社员座谈活学活用“老三篇”的体会
    河北省定县息塚公社流驼庄大队社员，最近集会座谈活学活用“老三篇”的体会。大家一致认为，只有认真地在斗争中学，在斗争中用，认真地改造思想，才能真正把毛泽东思想学到手，收到立竿见影的效果。他们说，近几年来，由于坚持在斗争中学，在斗争中用，反复学，反复用，越学越新，越学越亲，硬是学得人换思想地换装，沙滩变成了米粮仓。下面是一部分干部和社员的发言纪要：把毛主席的教导同自己思想对上号
    老饲养员甄喜振说：我刚学习“老三篇”，心里挺高兴，牲口喂得好，还天天积肥。心想，队长一定得表扬表扬。那知没有被表扬，这下我可泄气了，圈也不及时垫了，牲口也不好好喂了。社员们批评我有私心，我还不认账。
    队上组织社员学习《纪念白求恩》，可把我将了一军。毛主席说：“出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道。”我一字一板地琢磨，把毛主席的教导同自己的思想对号。这一对，我就发现自己错了。站在个人私利的立场上去学习，怎么能学好、用上啊！养牲口是为了革命，决不是为了受表扬。抱着私利的目的来学习，是八辈子也学不好的。以后，我又学了《为人民服务》，决心改造自己的思想。今年夏季，队上的两头驴生了驹。先生的一头没奶吃，我就喂它粥。后生的一头有了奶，我就叫两驹吃一头驴的奶。奶不够吃，我就把家里端来的饭喂它们。因为思想提高了，越学越有劲，工作再不泄气了。
    十三队会计甄栓宝说：今年夏季俺队收成不错，我高兴地准备向上级报实产。个别人说我是向上级“讨好”；还有的说我“不聪明”。这时，我的思想有了斗争：瞒点产吧，对不住国家；不瞒吧，有人说难听的话。怎么办呢？想到毛主席说的，不要一事当前，先替个人打算，我还是当机立断，报了实产。个别私心重的人不满意，我就引导大家学习毛主席著作，并对私心重的人提出了批评。我说：咱们听毛主席的话，才得来了丰收；不向国家说实话，怎么对得住毛主席！我这样一说，一些私心重的人都做了检讨。关键是在“用”字上狠下功夫
    大队团支书甄英民说：有很长一段时间，我很纳闷：自己干了不少好事，群众总是对我有意见，这是什么原因呢？按照毛主席的教导，我认真地想起来，才找到了根子：干重活时自己一时带了头，但往往很快就松下来，又拣轻的干；有时做点好事，也好嚷嚷，想让别人知道。毛主席说：“出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道。”他老人家说的不正是我吗？我虽然把毛主席的许多语录背得烂熟，但干起来还是违反毛主席的教导，就是因为没有在“用”字上狠下功夫啊！懂得了这个道理，我就注意活学活用了。学了毛主席“担子拣重的挑”的教导，我就拣浇地拧辘轳、掏大粪等重活、脏活干。队长给轻活，我就拒绝。这么一连闯了半年多，社员们说：英民今年算跟大伙合上流了。我体会到，要想学好毛主席著作，必须认真地学，刻苦地用，敢于为革命吃苦。
    六队妇女队长杨灵彦说：今年春天选我当妇女队长，我觉着自己一不识字，二不会说，怕干不了，想推给别人。学习了《纪念白求恩》，才知道自己的思想不对头。毛主席说：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”毛主席说的正是像我这样的人。我就想：当队长有困难，看着困难是闯，还是躲呢？这是革命不革命的问题。我下了决心：听毛主席的话，闯！干起来后，困难确实不少。开会不会记录，听完记不住几句；读毛主席的书，又不识字。这怎么办呢？在一次会议上，又听了毛主席一段语录：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲
  ‘认真’。”一琢磨毛主席这段话，心里刷啦亮了：学习，也必须认真才行。先让别人教，自己下功夫背；背会了，再同书上对号，学写，学认。有时碰上困难，就重温毛主席的教导，认真坚持下去。一连二百多天，回头一看，一想，我也楞了。一个大字不识的人，经过这一段的努力，现在能看“老三篇”，开会能作简单的记录，还能帮助社员学习毛主席著作了。通过这件事，我深深体会到世界上怕的硬是“认真”二字啊！只要认真下功夫，就能学懂，用上。去掉私心才能认真地用
    一队队长甄丑货说：我们队里收完花生后，有个干部带着几个社员搂花生叶，把拾的花生装进个人的口袋里。我一看这不对，正要开口，心又动起来了。我想：要说吧，怕得罪人；不说吧，明明知道这事不对。这时我想起毛主席在《纪念白求恩》这篇文章里说的话：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。”我怕得罪人，不正是有私心吗？我就理直气壮地向他们提了意见。有的人不高兴，我就向他们宣传毛主席的教导，大伙都知道自己不对了。我体会到学习毛主席著作，只有丢掉私心，才能认真地用。
    十三队女社员甄趁端说：学习《为人民服务》这篇文章时，见到大家那股热情劲儿，我也表示要为革命贡献力量。社员们选我当了积肥员，我当时答应下来。可是一实干，思想起了变化，嫌这个活脏，想辞了不干。可又怕别人笑话。这时候，辅导员帮助我学了《纪念白求恩》。毛主席说：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。”我一听这话，就想：掏大粪是脏活，我不干别人也得干，这不是把重担子推给人家吗？去掉私心以后，我不光掏大粪，还搞高温沤肥，和粪汤子，并到各户收尿，决心作个有益于人民的人。社员们表扬我，说我是“娇姑娘”变成了“好姑娘”。
    记工员甄茂申说：对我们队的掏大粪记工分问题，社员们有一阵子有争论。有的社员说：“掏粪的人马马虎虎，不清不楚。”一调查，发现有的积肥员怕麻烦，论桶算账，质量不管好歹，结果让有私心的人沾了便宜。我想把这个问题提出来，但又想，自己是管记工的，这不是份内的事，管不管呢？想起毛主席的教导，我决定不从私利着想，就和积肥员一起试验，找出了检验质量的标准，合理评定，社员们满意了，有私心的人也作了检讨。要没完没了地活学活用
    饲养员甄金忙说：要学好毛主席著作，就得没完没了地学，没完没了地用，没完没了地找差距，没完没了地做好事。去年春天，俺队上的三头牲口瘦弱，让我当饲养员。我一看，就抓了脑瓜皮。这可怎么办呢？
    这时候，我想起毛主席为人民服务的教导来。我觉得自己是共产党员，把牲口喂好了，就是为人民服务。毛主席还说：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”就这么着，我把任务担当起来，紧紧按照毛主席“精益求精”的教导，精心喂养。一连几个月，把几头牲口喂得膘肥体壮，我觉得比吃糖还甜哩！
    工作做到这种地步，工作量少了。我娘说：“你抓个空到队上干点别的活，不多挣点工分吗？”娘一说，我倒动了心思。可是拿起“老三篇”来学，心想：一事当前，不能光替个人打算。活少了，还得给集体找活干。我就大力积起肥来。可是，有时还闲着。这不行啊！全心全意为人民服务，就不能偷闲。队上买了十五头猪，我又当了猪的饲养员。我去地里铲草积肥，去时空着手，就想何不带几只羊捎着放？我又当上了羊倌。以后，又给队里买了一群鸡，当上了家禽饲养员。一员变成了五员、六员，为集体创造了财富。
    我们队里的社员常常唱：“毛主席的书我最爱读，千遍那个万遍下功夫……”正是这样，下一次功夫增一次见识，增一分收获，“老三篇”永远是“新三篇”。
