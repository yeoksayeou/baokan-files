De Gaulle Demands U.S. Troops Withdraw from South Vietnam
But Avoids Mentioning the Just Demands of the Vietnamese People, Advocates for "Neutralization" in Southeast Asia

	New China News Agency, Paris, October 31

	French President Charles de Gaulle held a press conference on October 28, discussing issues such as the Vietnam problem, Franco-American relations, and East-West relations. De Gaulle emphasized that the main goal of French foreign policy is to oppose American hegemony and "restore France to the ranks of the great powers."

	Regarding the Vietnam issue, De Gaulle said that the continuous bombing of Vietnam by the United States is "extremely despicable." On one hand, he stated, "We believe that there is no military victory for the Americans over the Vietnamese people," but on the other hand, he said, "We do not believe that the Vietnamese people have the ability to destroy the power of the United States."

	From this perspective, although this French president said that France does not propose any kind of mediation for the Vietnam War "because no one welcomes such mediation, and such mediation will not lead to any results," he also said, "We also want to make it as clear as possible what, in our view, are the conditions that will one day allow negotiations to stop the war."

	The conditions proposed by De Gaulle are: the United States adheres to and implements the principle of the Vietnamese people solving their own problems themselves; the Americans withdraw the troops they sent to Vietnam in batches after the French withdrew from Vietnam.

	It is well known that to achieve these conditions and solve the Vietnam problem, the only way is for the American aggressors to completely accept the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. However, this French president avoids mentioning the just demands of the Vietnamese people and, from the perspective of France's own interests, proposes that the Americans must withdraw their troops from South Vietnam and establish a "genuine supervised neutrality" in Southeast Asia, as well as provide "aid" to Southeast Asia, as the "basis for future solutions."

	De Gaulle went on to say: "The United States must acknowledge that in Asia, any agreement and any important treaty will not be effective without the participation of China; they must draw conclusions from this in establishing relations with this great power and in restoring this great power's legitimate seat in the United Nations."

	De Gaulle said at the press conference: "The current policies and public opinion of the United States are not developing in this (French-proposed) direction," therefore, France's position is "in conflict with the United States."

	De Gaulle's above-mentioned proposals, in fact, reaffirmed the stance he advocated during his visit to Cambodia in September and later by the French representative at the United Nations General Assembly: once the United States takes on the "obligation" to withdraw troops from South Vietnam, political negotiations should immediately begin. On this point, world public opinion has long pointed out that, given the United States' consistent stance of refusing to leave South Vietnam, even if the United States agrees to unconditional withdrawal, it would only be a promise from a swindler.

	Regarding Franco-American relations, he expressed his disagreement with "mixing its currency with the Washington monetary fund (organization), merging its individuality into the United Nations, etc." He said that the United States "dominates these organizations... these organizations are merely a facade for us to submit to American hegemony."

	After France withdrew from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under U.S. control, the United States still attempted to control the French military and maintain bases in France through other means. In response to these attempts, De Gaulle said, the French military is no longer "subordinate to any foreign authority," and "five months later, there will be no staff, troops, or bases of any allied country on our territory." He also emphasized that France will continue to develop its own nuclear capabilities.

	De Gaulle also criticized the United States for courting West Germany and undermining Franco-German relations. He said: "The relationship between Bonn and Washington, which is constantly developing, has already deprived (the Franco-German treaty signed four years ago) of its basis and substance."

	Regarding relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, De Gaulle expressed that France will continue to pursue a policy of "peaceful evolution" for these countries. He said that he visited the Soviet Union this summer, and Soviet leaders will also visit France. He also said that France's relations with Eastern European countries are also "undergoing profound changes," and the "cold war seems trivial, while organizing increasingly large friendly cooperation" with these countries.

### 戴高乐要美国军队从南越撤出去  但是避而不提越南人民的正义主张，鼓吹在东南亚实现“中立化”

    戴高乐要美国军队从南越撤出去
    但是避而不提越南人民的正义主张，鼓吹在东南亚实现“中立化”
    新华社巴黎三十一日电　法国总统戴高乐十月二十八日举行记者招待会，谈到越南问题、法美关系、东西方关系等问题。戴高乐强调法国外交政策的主要目标是反对美国霸权，“使法国重新出现于大国的行列之中”。
    戴高乐在谈到越南问题时说，美国对越南人民的不断轰炸“是极其可恶的”。他一方面说：“我们相信，不存在能使美国人征服越南人的军事胜利”，同时，却又说什么“我们更不相信越南人有可能摧毁美国的力量”。
    从这一观点出发，这位法国总统虽然说法国对越南战争“并不提出任何种类的调解，因为任何人都不欢迎这种调解，而这种调解也不会导致任何结果”；但是，他又说：“我们也要尽可能明确地指出，在我们看来，什么是有朝一日将能使人进行谈判以便停止战争的各种条件。”
    戴高乐所提出的条件是：美国遵守和履行由越南人民自己解决自己问题的原则；美国人把他们在法国从越南撤军后一批一批地派到越南去的军队撤回美国。
    众所周知，要实现这些条件，要解决越南问题，唯一的途径是，美国侵略者必须完全接受越南民主共和国关于解决越南问题的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。可是，这位法国总统对于越南人民的这些正义主张避而不提，却从法国本身利益出发，提出要美国人必须把什么东南亚的“真正有监督的真正中立化”以及向东南亚提供“援助”，作为“将来解决办法的基础”。
    戴高乐接着说：“美国必须承认，在亚洲如果没有中国参加，任何协议和任何重要条约都不会是有效的，他们在同这个大国建立关系上，在恢复这个大国在联合国的合法席位问题上，必须从中得到结论。”
    戴高乐在记者招待会上说：“美国的政策和舆论目前不是朝着这个（法国所提出的）方向发展”，因此，法国的立场同美国“相抵触”。
    戴高乐的上述主张，事实上是重申了他在今年九月份访问柬埔寨时和此后法国代表在联合国大会上所鼓吹的立场：一旦美国承担了从南越撤退军队的“义务”，就立即开始政治谈判。对于这一点，世界公正舆论早已指出，从美国要赖在南越不走的一贯行径来看，即使美国答应无条件撤军，也只不过是骗子手的诺言。
    在谈到法美关系时，他表示不能同意“把它的货币混同在华盛顿货币基金（组织）中，把它的个性融化在联合国中，等等。”他说，美国“在这些组织中占统治地位……这些组织只不过是要我们屈从于美国霸权的一种幌子罢了。”
    美国在法国退出美国控制下的北大西洋集团司令部以后，还企图用其他方法控制法国军队和在法国保持基地。针对美国这些企图，戴高乐说，法国军队不再“隶属于任何外国当局”，“五个月以后，我们的领土上不会再有任何盟国军队的任何参谋部、部队和基地”。他还强调法国要继续发展自己的核力量。
    戴高乐还抨击美国拉拢西德，破坏法国同西德的关系。他说：“波恩和华盛顿结成的和不断发展的关系已经剥夺了（四年前签订的）法德条约的根据和实质。”
    戴高乐在谈到同苏联和东欧国家关系时，表示法国要继续推行使这些国家“和平演变”的政策。他说，他今年夏天访问了苏联，苏联领导人也将回访法国。他还说，法国同东欧国家的关系也在“深刻地更新”，法国同这些国家的“冷战看来已微不足道了，而在组织越来越大的友好合作”。
