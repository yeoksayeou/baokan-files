The entire staff of the Chinese Embassy in Ghana, led by Chargé d'Affaires Huang Shixian, departed Accra for China on the morning of November 5th. The Xinhua News Agency correspondent also left Ghana on the same flight.

The Chinese Embassy staff in Ghana were originally scheduled to leave on November 3rd, but the reactionary military junta in Ghana unreasonably obstructed their departure at the Accra airport. The Chinese Chargé d'Affaires protested this multiple times. It was not until November 5th that the Chinese personnel were allowed to leave the country.

At 7:00 AM on November 5th, the entire staff of the Chinese Embassy, wearing badges with Chairman Mao's portrait, held a solemn flag-lowering ceremony before boarding the plane for the airport.

At the Accra airport, Huang Shixian distributed a farewell statement to Ghanaian and foreign friends as well as reporters. The statement pointed out that since February of this year, the Ghanaian government has been pursuing an anti-China policy and, with ulterior motives, has taken a series of measures to deteriorate relations between China and Ghana. The Chinese government has only adopted a restrained attitude towards the Ghanaian government's anti-China policy out of a desire to maintain the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. However, the Ghanaian government has gone too far, even to the point of using their propaganda machine to viciously attack the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, who is deeply respected by the Chinese people. Now, they have taken the action of severing diplomatic relations between China and Ghana, thus fully exposing their role as lackeys of American imperialism. All these facts show that the responsibility for disrupting Sino-Ghanaian relations lies entirely with the Ghanaian side. The Ghanaian government's attempt to shirk its responsibility is in vain and will deceive no one.

The statement said that the Chinese Embassy in Ghana has made unremitting efforts over the past six years to strengthen the friendship between the peoples of China and Ghana; the Ghanaian people, with a tradition of opposing imperialism and colonialism, have also contributed to this cause. We are firmly convinced that the deep friendship between our two peoples, built up over many years, cannot be destroyed by any force. Imperialism and reactionaries can only lift a stone to drop on their own feet, reaping the consequences of their own evil deeds.

Huang Shixian, in his farewell statement, wished the Ghanaian people victory in their just cause of defending national independence and maintaining national dignity. The statement concluded by saying, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history.' We believe that the clouds in the sky are only a temporary phenomenon, and the sun will soon break through these clouds, and the flower of Sino-Ghanaian friendship will bloom more luxuriantly than ever.

At the Accra airport, the Chinese Embassy staff were warmly seen off by Ghanaian friends and diplomatic envoys from friendly countries. A Ghanaian friend said to the Chinese staff, "Please convey our respect to Chairman Mao." Over the past week, many Ghanaian friends have expressed their dissatisfaction with the reactionary Ghanaian government's alignment with American and British imperialism and the unreasonable severing of Sino-Ghanaian relations. They expressed their boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep friendship for the Chinese people to the Chinese staff. Two Ghanaian youths came to the Chinese Embassy and requested a large portrait of Chairman Mao, expressing their intention to keep it forever. They said that although the Ghanaian government could force the Chinese staff to leave, it could not restrict the Ghanaian people's love for Chairman Mao and the Chinese people.

When bidding farewell to the Chinese staff, many Ghanaian friends cherished the badges with Chairman Mao's portrait given to them by the Chinese staff and expressed their reluctance to part. One Ghanaian friend said, "The clouds will surely disperse. We firmly believe that this day will come, and you will return again." A retired Ghanaian official encountered the Chinese staff on the street and, with tears in his eyes, said, "When I saw the Chinese flag lowered at the Chinese Embassy, I couldn't help but cry. It was China that gave us such friendly help, and it was China that sent experts to help Ghana build. China has never done anything wrong to Ghana, and this is something we Ghanaians are very clear about." Some Ghanaian friends also enthusiastically congratulated the Chinese staff on China's successful test launch of a missile-carrying nuclear weapon. A Ghanaian said that although the Ghanaian newspapers, under the orders of the government, tried to downplay the great significance of this event, the Ghanaian people saw it clearly and were inspired by it.

On October 29th, Huang Shixian held a farewell reception and exposed to the Ghanaian friends and envoys from friendly countries the series of crimes committed by the reactionary Ghanaian government in disrupting Sino-Ghanaian relations.

On November 1st, the Pakistani High Commissioner to Ghana held a farewell reception for the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires.

    我驻加纳使馆全体人员离阿克拉回国
    加纳人民对毛主席的热爱是无法限制的
    我临时代办行前发表声明谴责加纳反动当局片面中断两国关系
    加纳朋友和友好国家的外交使节在机场热情欢送我使馆人员
    新华社六日讯　阿克拉消息：中国驻加纳大使馆临时代办黄世燮和使馆的全部人员在加纳反动军事政变当局片面宣布中断中加两国关系后，于五日上午乘飞机离开阿克拉回国。新华社驻阿克拉记者也同机离开加纳。
    中国驻加纳大使馆人员原定在本月三日乘飞机离开加纳的，但在阿克拉机场，加纳反动当局无理阻挠，不让我国人员离开。为此，我国临时代办多次提出了抗议。直到五日，我国人员才被同意离境。
    五日上午七点钟，胸前佩戴着毛主席像纪念章的中国使馆全体人员举行了庄严的降旗仪式，然后登车前往机场。
    黄世燮临时代办在阿克拉机场向送行的加纳和外国朋友以及记者散发了告别声明。声明指出，加纳当局自从今年二月以来一直奉行反华政策，并且怀着不可告人的动机采取了一系列措施来恶化中国和加纳的关系。中国政府只是出于维护中加两国人民友谊的愿望，才对加纳当局的反华政策一直采取克制的态度。但是，加纳当局越走越远，甚至到了开动他们的宣传机器恶毒攻击中国人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的地步。现在，他们终于采取了中断中加两国关系的行动，从而使他们充当美帝国主义走卒的本来面目完全暴露无遗。这一切事实表明，破坏中加两国关系的责任完全是在加纳方面。加纳当局想逃避自己的责任完全是徒劳的，欺骗不了任何人。
    声明说，中国驻加纳大使馆在过去六年中作出了不懈的努力来增强中国和加纳人民的友谊；具有反对帝国主义和殖民主义传统的加纳人民也为这一事业作出了贡献。我们坚信，我们两国人民多年来建立的深厚友谊是任何力量都破坏不了的。美帝国主义和反动派只能搬起石头砸自己的脚，自食其恶果。
    黄世燮在告别声明中祝加纳人民在保卫民族独立和维护民族尊严的正义事业中获得胜利。声明最后说，毛泽东主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”我们相信，天空中出现的乌云，只不过是暂时的现象，太阳必将会很快突破这些阴云，中加人民的友谊之花将再度更繁茂地开放。
    在阿克拉机场，中国大使馆人员受到加纳朋友和友好国家的外交使节的热情欢送。一位加纳朋友对中国人员说：“请转达我们对毛主席的敬意。”在过去一个多星期以来，很多加纳朋友对加纳反动当局投靠美、英帝国主义，无理中断中加两国关系表示不满。他们向中国人员表达了对毛泽东主席的无限热爱和对中国人民的深厚友情。两个加纳青年来到中国大使馆，向使馆人员要求把毛主席的大幅肖像赠送给他们，并且表示将把这肖像永远珍藏起来。他们说，加纳当局虽然可以迫使中国人员离开，但无法限制加纳人民对毛主席和中国人民的热爱。
    在和中国人员告别时，很多加纳朋友都对中国人员赠送给他们的毛主席像纪念章非常珍爱，对中国人员表示依依惜别。一位加纳朋友说，“乌云总会消散。我们坚信这一天终将到来，你们将再回来。”一位退休的加纳官员在街上遇到了中国人员，他激动地对他们说：“当我看到中国使馆悬挂的中国国旗降落下来时，我忍不住地哭了。是中国给了我们极为友好的帮助，是中国派遣专家来帮助加纳建设。中国没有做过任何一点点对不起加纳的事情，这一点我们加纳人都非常清楚。”一些加纳朋友还热情地向中国人员祝贺中国发射导弹核武器试验成功。一个加纳人说，尽管加纳报纸在当局指使下尽力贬低这一事件的伟大意义，但加纳人民都看得很清楚，并为此感到鼓舞。
    十月二十九日，黄世燮临时代办举行了告别酒会，并向出席酒会的加纳朋友和友好国家的使节揭露了加纳反动当局破坏中加两国关系的一系列罪行。
    十一月一日，巴基斯坦驻加纳高级专员为中国临时代办举行了送别酒会。
