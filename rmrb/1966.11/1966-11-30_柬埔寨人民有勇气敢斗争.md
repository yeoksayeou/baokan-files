On November 22, the U.S. imperialists and their South Vietnamese lackeys shelled Cambodian territory. Prior to this, they had also dispatched aircraft to violate Cambodian airspace. This is a new act of aggression committed by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against the Cambodian people.

For a long time, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in South Vietnam and Thailand have been constantly provoking and invading Cambodia. This is because Cambodia resolutely defends its national sovereignty and independence, supports the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, opposes U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and Laos, and insists on developing friendly relations with China. This policy, which is in the interests of the Cambodian people, has greatly infuriated U.S. imperialism. Therefore, U.S. imperialism has been trying to use military pressure to force Cambodia to change its policy.

Recently, the Cambodian government and people have made great efforts, together with the peoples of various Asian countries, to resolutely frustrate the sabotage plots of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. They successfully held the First Asian New Forces Games in Phnom Penh. This games was a grand demonstration of the unity of Asian peoples against imperialism. On the eve of the opening of the games, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys once again launched a military invasion against Cambodia, which was certainly not accidental.

U.S. imperialism thinks: The United States is a big country; a small country like Cambodia cannot withstand American pressure and will definitely surrender.

Facts have proven that U.S. imperialism's thinking is completely wrong.

Chairman Mao said, "All the peoples of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the peoples of the world must dare to struggle, must not be afraid of difficulties, must advance bravely and unyieldingly, and then the whole world will definitely be the world of the people. All the devils will be thoroughly wiped out."

Cambodia is not afraid of the U.S. imperialist giant. It has the courage to stand up to U.S. imperialism. Despite years of various pressures from U.S. imperialism, Cambodia has not been intimidated. In his speech on the 22nd, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the head of state of Cambodia, pointed out that U.S. imperialism's attempt to force Cambodia to surrender through aggression is "stupid and futile" because the Cambodian people "will never be afraid and will never retreat." In his speech on the 25th, Prince Sihanouk strongly condemned the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against Cambodia, firmly supported the just struggles of the peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and the Arabs. He emphasized that the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have only one way out, that is, to struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The Chinese people highly admire the spirit of the Cambodian people who are not afraid of powerful enemies and firmly support the just struggle of the Cambodian people against U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people are fully convinced that in the face of the Cambodian government and people who insist on maintaining national sovereignty and independence, U.S. imperialism will definitely suffer a crushing defeat.

    柬埔寨人民有勇气敢斗争
    本报评论员
    十一月二十二日，美帝国主义及其南越走狗炮击柬埔寨领土，在此以前，还出动飞机侵犯柬埔寨领空。这是美帝国主义及其走狗对柬埔寨人民犯下的新的侵略罪行。
    长期以来，美帝国主义和它在南越和泰国的走狗，不断对柬埔寨进行挑衅和侵略。这是因为，柬埔寨坚决维护自己国家的主权和独立，支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的反帝斗争，反对美帝国主义对越南和老挝的侵略，坚持发展同中国的友好关系。这种符合柬埔寨人民利益的政策，却使美帝国主义大为恼火。因此，美帝国主义一直企图用军事压力来迫使柬埔寨改变自己的政策。
    最近，柬埔寨政府和人民进行了巨大的努力，同亚洲各国人民一起坚决地粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗的破坏阴谋，在金边举行了第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会。这次运动会就是亚洲各国人民团结反帝的一次大示威。在运动会开幕前夕，美帝国主义及其走狗再一次对柬埔寨进行军事侵略，这决不是偶然的。
    美帝国主义认为：美国是一个大国；柬埔寨这样一个小国家，在美国的压力面前是顶不住的，是一定会屈服的。
    事实证明，美帝国主义这种想法是大错特错了。
    毛主席说：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    柬埔寨就是不害怕美帝国主义这个庞然大物的，是有勇气顶美帝国主义的。尽管几年来美帝国主义不断对柬埔寨施加各种压力，但是柬埔寨并没有被吓倒。柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王在二十二日的谈话中就指出：美帝国主义要想用侵略来迫使柬埔寨屈服是“愚蠢和徒劳的”，因为柬埔寨人民“永远不会害怕，永远不会后退”。西哈努克亲王在二十五日的谈话中，强烈谴责了美帝国主义及其走狗对柬埔寨的侵略，坚决支持越南、老挝和阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。他并且强调说，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民只有一条出路，那就是同美帝国主义斗争。
    中国人民十分钦佩柬埔寨人民不畏强敌的精神，坚决支持柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。中国人民完全相信，在坚持维护国家主权和独立政策的柬埔寨政府和人民面前，美帝国主义是一定会碰得头破血流的。
