The plot of "Two Chinas" is bound to fail.

The Canadian representative at the UN General Assembly debate on the so-called "Chinese representation issue" proposed an absurd "three-point plan." This plan advocates that the legitimate representatives of the Chinese people and the "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan should both participate in the UN General Assembly as "member states" representing the territories they effectively control. Meanwhile, the legitimate representatives of the Chinese people should "participate in the Security Council as a permanent member." This is, to date, the most blatant plan openly proposed in the United Nations to serve the U.S. imperialists' "Two Chinas" plot.

The U.S. imperialists have long been pushing the "Two Chinas" plot. In essence, "Two Chinas" means legalizing the U.S. occupation of Chinese territory Taiwan and continuing to deprive the People's Republic of China of its legitimate rights in the United Nations. The Canadian representative insisted that his "three-point plan" "in no way implies the existence of two Chinas." However, this ridiculous claim cannot deceive anyone. The Canadian representative had to resort to such a clumsy trick of "denying the existence of silver when there is none," which precisely exposes his guilty conscience.

To carry out its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and to deprive China of its legitimate seat in the United Nations, the U.S. imperialists have racked their brains. In this session of the United Nations General Assembly, first, Italy and other countries proposed the establishment of a "committee" to "study" the so-called "Chinese representation issue." Then, they came up with the trick of requiring a two-thirds majority to pass what they call an "important issue." Now, they are using Canada as a front to push the "Two Chinas" plot. This clearly shows that the U.S. imperialists are in an increasingly desperate and isolated situation.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out that our enemies "still want to bully the People's Republic of China. They still want to dominate the world. But comrades, I can assure you that their ambitions are delusional, futile, and impossible to achieve."

The United Nations has long become a tool for American aggression. The question today is that the United Nations must break away from American control and thoroughly correct its mistakes. China does not seek anything from the United Nations. China's legitimate rights in the United Nations are inviolable. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the Chinese people's stance on liberating Taiwan is unshakable. Various plots of "Two Chinas" are doomed to fail and will never succeed. Those who serve this plot of U.S. imperialism can only expose their shameful faces as accomplices in front of the people of the world.

    “两个中国”的阴谋必定破产
    本报评论员
    加拿大代表在联大辩论所谓中国代表权问题的会议上，提出了一个荒唐透顶的“三点计划”，主张中国人民的合法代表同台湾蒋介石匪帮的“代表”都作为“代表一块它有效地管辖的土地”的“成员国”参加联合国大会，而由中国人民的合法代表“作为常任国参加安全理事会”。这是迄今为止，在联合国公开提出的一个最露骨地为美帝国主义的“两个中国”阴谋效劳的计划。
    美帝国主义推行“两个中国”的阴谋，由来已久。所谓“两个中国”，说穿了，就是要使美国霸占中国领土台湾的强盗行为合法化，就是要继续剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。加拿大代表竭力表白说，它的“三点计划”，“决无暗示存在两个中国的意思”。但是，这种无聊的表白是骗不了任何人的。加拿大代表不得不玩弄这种“此地无银三百两”的拙劣把戏，恰恰暴露了它的作贼心虚。
    美帝国主义为了推行它敌视中国人民的政策，剥夺中国在联合国的合法席位，真是绞尽了脑汁。在这届联合国大会上，先是由意大利等国提出要成立一个“委员会”来“研究”所谓“中国代表权问题”的提案，接着又搞必须经三分之二多数通过的所谓“重要问题”的花样。现在，又通过加拿大出面，推行“两个中国”的阴谋。这正好表明，美帝国主义的处境，是越来越狼狈，越来越孤立了。
    毛主席早就指出，我们的敌人“还想欺负中华人民共和国，他们还想称霸世界。但是，同志们，我可以断定，他们的想法是狂妄的，是徒然的，是不可能达到目的的。”
    联合国早已成为美国的侵略工具。今天的问题，是联合国必须摆脱美国的控制，彻底纠正自己的错误。中国无求于联合国。中国在联合国的合法权利，是任何人剥夺不了的。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，中国人民解放台湾的立场，是任何人动摇不了的。各式各样的
  “两个中国”的阴谋，是注定要破产的，是决不能得逞的。为美帝国主义这一阴谋效劳的人，只能在全世界人民面前，暴露自己的可耻的帮凶面目。
