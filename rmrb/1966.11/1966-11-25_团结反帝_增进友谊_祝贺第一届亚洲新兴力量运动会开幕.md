		United Against Imperialism, Strengthening Friendship
		—Celebrating the Opening of the First Asian New Forces Games

		November 25 is the day of friendship and unity among athletes of the new forces. The first Asian New Forces Games also opened on this day in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, in a grand ceremony. The Chinese people, sports workers, and athletes warmly celebrate this festival of strengthening friendship, and warmly celebrate this conference of unity against imperialism.

		This Asian New Forces Games is being held amidst the surging struggle of the Asian people against American imperialism. Therefore, it will inevitably become a grand demonstration of Asian people uniting to oppose American imperialism, and a grand review of the common will and powerful strength of the Asian people in opposing American imperialism.

		All decaying forces in the world are afraid of the new forces, and all reactionary forces are afraid of revolutionary forces.

		Chairman Mao said: “In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish always make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces.”

		American imperialism, modern revisionism of the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of various countries are extremely afraid of the awakened revolutionary people of various countries. They spare no effort in using various tricks to sabotage their united revolutionary cause. Now, they are attempting to sabotage the first Asian New Forces Games.

		However, American imperialism and all the fools in the world always “pick up stones to hit their own feet.” Their sabotage of the sports cause of the new forces can only promote this cause to develop even more vigorously.

		The people of various Asian countries, in their struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs, gradually realize that unity against imperialism and independence are the only correct paths for developing the people’s sports cause. They bravely break through the monopoly and control of American imperialism and its running dogs, hold the Asian New Forces Games, and open up a vast new horizon for the sports cause of the people of various Asian countries. This allows the athletes of various Asian countries to fully display their talents, gives them the opportunity to learn from each other, exchange experiences, and jointly improve, creating excellent results. This is a major victory for the cause of unity against imperialism among the people of various Asian countries, and a major victory for the people of various Asian countries in independently developing their sports cause.

		The unity of the people of various Asian countries is something that no force can destroy. The sports cause of the new forces in Asia is also something that no force can destroy. We are confident that the people of various Asian countries, who have been bravely fighting against American imperialism, have the confidence and strength to smash all the sabotage plots of American imperialism and its running dogs. Under the banner of unity against imperialism and strengthening friendship, they will definitely hold the first Asian New Forces Games successfully and make it a complete success.

		The Chinese athletes, carrying the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the people of various countries, gather with the athletes of various Asian countries in our friendly neighboring country, Cambodia. This is a grand event. Our athletes should firmly remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, insist on the four firsts, carry forward the spirit of the May 30th Movement, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, excellently completing the important mission entrusted by the Party and the people of the motherland.

		Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people, sports workers, and athletes resolutely stand together with the people, sports workers, and athletes of various Asian countries. We will strive together to oppose American imperialism, to strengthen the friendship and unity of the people of various Asian countries, to successfully hold the first Asian New Forces Games, and to further develop the sports cause of the people of various Asian countries.

    团结反帝　增进友谊
    ——祝贺第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会开幕
    十一月二十五日，是新兴力量运动员友谊团结日。第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会，也在这一天，在柬埔寨首都金边隆重开幕。中国人民、体育工作者和运动员，热烈庆祝这个增强友谊的节日，热烈庆祝这个团结反帝的大会。
    这次亚洲新运会，是在亚洲人民风起云涌地反对美帝国主义的斗争中举行的。因此，它就必然成为一次亚洲人民团结起来反对美帝国主义的大示威，成为亚洲人民反对美帝国主义的共同意志和强大力量的大检阅。
    世界上一切腐朽势力总是害怕新兴力量的，一切反动势力总是害怕革命力量的。
    毛主席说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。
    美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派，十分害怕觉醒了的革命的各国人民，不惜采取种种阴谋诡计来破坏他们的团结革命的事业，现在又妄图破坏第一届亚洲新运会。
    然而，美帝国主义和世界上的一切蠢人们，总是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。他们对新兴力量体育事业的破坏，只能促进这一事业更加蓬勃发展。
    亚洲各国人民在同美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，逐渐认识到，团结反帝，独立自主，是发展人民体育事业的唯一正确的道路。他们英勇地冲破了美帝国主义及其走狗的垄断和控制，举办亚洲新运会，为亚洲各国人民体育事业开辟了一片广阔的新天地。这就使亚洲各国运动员的才能有可能得到充分的发挥，使他们有机会互相学习，交流经验，共同提高，创造出优良的成绩来。这是亚洲各国人民团结反帝事业的一个重大胜利，是亚洲各国人民独立自主地发展体育事业的一个重大胜利。
    亚洲各国人民的团结，是任何力量也破坏不了的。亚洲新兴力量体育事业，也是任何力量破坏不了的。我们深信，一向为反对美帝国主义而英勇斗争的亚洲各国人民，完全有信心，有力量，粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的各种破坏阴谋，在团结反帝，增进友谊的旗帜下，一定会把第一届亚洲新运会开好，使它取得圆满成功。
    中国运动员满载着中国人民对各国人民的深厚友情，在我们友好的邻邦柬埔寨同亚洲各国选手聚会一堂，这是一件盛事。我国选手应当牢记我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，出色地完成党和祖国人民所交给的重大使命。
    在毛泽东思想教导下的中国人民、体育工作者和运动员，坚决地同亚洲各国人民、体育工作者和运动员在一起，为反对美帝国主义，为增进亚洲各国人民的友谊和团结，为开好第一届亚洲新运会，为进一步发展亚洲各国人民的体育事业而共同奋斗。
