In ten days of joint labor, foreign friends and commune members seemed like one family, living in a revolutionary big family. Their most affectionate language was the shared expression of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They exchanged portraits of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao badges, took photos together in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, and vowed to forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, aiming to liberate the entire world completely.

This shared revolutionary camaraderie bound everyone together. The commune members, following Chinese custom, affectionately called the foreign friends "Old Xiao" and "Old Wen"; the foreign friends warmly called the commune members "peasant brothers" and "Chinese comrades." Every time after labor, the commune members would always inquire about the foreign friends' well-being, offering them water and tea. Some foreign friends, emulating the "Old Eighth Route Army" style, carried water for the masses, swept the floors, and helped with cooking. Some female experts, after finishing work, rushed to wash clothes and mend quilts for the commune members. The commune members, while they were working in the fields, quietly cleaned the foreign friends' shoes. Sometimes, when foreign friends visited the commune members' homes, if they were dressed lightly, the commune members would take off their own padded clothes and put them on the friends.

During the time foreign friends spent with the commune members, the commune members often told them: "Our lives are getting better and better, but we will never forget the past, and we will never forget the people of the world who have not yet been liberated. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, with our hearts in our country and our eyes on the world, to make revolution with the people of the world and seek liberation."

One evening, the Indonesian friend Mudiro visited the poor peasant Zhang Qisheng's home. When they discussed the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people, Zhang Qisheng said to Mudiro: "The Chinese people will forever support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people." Mudiro, moved, took Zhang Qisheng's hand and said, "The common revolutionary ideal unites our two peoples. With the great support of the Chinese people, the Indonesian people's revolution will definitely achieve victory. China will forever be our example."

One day, a New Zealand friend met an over eighty-year-old old man on the road and had a friendly conversation with him. The old man thought he was an American and smiled, saying, "We welcome you. The American people are our friends, but the American aggressors are our enemies." The New Zealand friend was very moved and said, "Even an elderly Chinese peasant can distinguish so clearly between the people of an imperialist country and its rulers. This is truly a good lesson in internationalism for me."

Many foreign friends, like this New Zealand friend, saw with their own eyes the noble proletarian internationalist spirit of the Chinese people in these ordinary peasants and personally felt that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are a powerful backbone for the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world.

One evening, the American friend Milton, upon invitation, spoke to the commune members about the struggle of African Americans against racial discrimination. When he mentioned Chairman Mao's strong support for the African American struggle and the victories of the African American struggle, everyone applauded enthusiastically. Finally, Milton presented a world map to the production team. He hoped that the commune members would hang this map in the production team's office, and whenever a country's revolution was victorious, they would color that country red, until the entire world was red.

    世界革命记心头
    在十天的共同劳动中，外国朋友和社员群众好像一家人，生活在一个革命的大家庭里。他们最亲切的语言，就是共同表达对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。他们互相赠送毛主席像和毛主席像纪念章，在毛主席像前合影留念，表示要永远跟着毛主席干革命，要使全世界获得彻底的解放。
    这种共同的革命情谊把大家紧紧联系在一起。社员们按照中国的习惯，亲切地称外国朋友为“老索”、“老文”；他们也亲热地称社员们为“农民兄弟”、“中国同志”。每次劳动回来，社员们总是关切地问寒问暖、送水送茶。有些外国朋友学着“老八路”的作风，给群众担水、扫地，帮助烧饭。有些女专家，下工回来抢着给社员洗衣服、缝褥子。社员趁她们下地劳动的时候，也悄悄地把她们的鞋子刷洗干净。有时候，外国朋友到社员家去串门，衣服穿得少了，社员就把自己身上的棉衣脱下来，给朋友们披上。
    外国朋友在和社员们相处的日子里，社员们经常对他们说：“我们的日子越过越好，但是我们绝不会忘记过去，绝不会忘记世界上还没有解放的人民。我们一定听毛主席的话，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，同世界人民一起闹革命，求解放。”
    印度尼西亚朋友穆迪罗，一天晚上到下中农常启生家去串门。当他们谈论到印度尼西亚人民的革命斗争的时候，常启生对穆迪罗说：“我们中国人民永远支持印度尼西亚人民的革命斗争。”穆迪罗激动地一把握住常启生的手说：“革命的共同理想，把我们两国人民联结在一起。有中国人民的巨大支持，印度尼西亚人民的革命一定会取得胜利。中国永远是我们的榜样。”
    有位新西兰朋友，一天在路上遇到一位八十多岁的老大爷，便亲切地交谈起来。老人以为他是美国人，笑着对他说：“我们欢迎你。美国人民是我们的朋友，美国侵略者才是我们的敌人。”这位新西兰朋友听了非常感动，他说：“这样大年岁的中国农民，都能把帝国主义国家的人民和统治者分得如此清楚。这对我来说，真是一次很好的国际主义教育。”
    许多外国朋友都和这位新西兰朋友一样，在这些普普通通的农民身上，亲眼看到了中国人民高尚的无产阶级国际主义精神，亲身体会到用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，是全世界被压迫人民革命斗争的强大后盾。
    一天晚上，美国朋友密尔顿，接受邀请向社员群众讲了美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争情况。当他谈到毛主席对美国黑人斗争的有力支持和美国黑人斗争的胜利时，大家热烈鼓起掌来。最后，密尔顿把一幅世界地图送给了生产队，他希望社员们把这幅地图挂在生产队的队部，那个国家革命胜利了，就把那个国家涂上红色，直到把全世界涂红了为止。
