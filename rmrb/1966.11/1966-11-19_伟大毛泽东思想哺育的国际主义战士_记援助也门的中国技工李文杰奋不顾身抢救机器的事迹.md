On February 4 this year, a Friday, which is a traditional day of worship for Muslims in Yemen, the construction site of the road between the port of Hodeidah and the capital Sana'a was unusually quiet. Li Wenjie and Zhou Fuling, technicians from the Chinese expert team assisting in the repair of this road, were using the day off to inspect and maintain the roller machine with Yemeni workers.

A Yemeni worker, while using gasoline to clean the diesel engine, accidentally touched the spark plug with a brush wrapped in iron, causing a fire. This ignited a large basin of gasoline placed under the roller machine. If the fire was not extinguished immediately, the roller machine, which had been transported from China, the diesel engine full of oil, and four barrels of diesel oil nearby would all catch fire and explode. Zhou Fuling, who was working under the machine, would be in even greater danger. At this critical moment, Communist Youth League member Li Wenjie, without hesitation, jumped down from the roller machine, picked up the burning basin of gasoline, and moved it several meters away from the machine.

The fire was extinguished, the machine was saved, and a serious fire was averted. However, the fire had already spread to Li Wenjie, who was covered in gasoline. His body, neck, arms, and legs were all on fire. Enduring the intense pain of his burning skin, he rolled on the ground covered with scattered stones, extinguishing the flames on his body.

When comrades rushed to rescue and comfort him, he said, "As long as the Yemeni friends are not injured and the machine is not burned, I am fine."

Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi sent a telegram to express his condolences to Li Wenjie, praising his fearless and selfless proletarian spirit and revolutionary heroism, as well as his internationalist spirit of serving the people of China and the world.

The Director-General of the Office of the Ministry of Public Works of Yemen, Ali, also visited Li Wenjie in the hospital, wishing him a speedy recovery.

The people of Yemen also highly praised Li Wenjie's heroic deeds. Ibrahim, the section chief of the road construction team who had worked with Li Wenjie, said, "Li Wenjie's spirit will never be forgotten. The shared experiences of the past and the common tasks of anti-imperialist struggle and national construction today have brought the peoples of the two countries closer together." The Deputy Director-General of the Office of the Ministry of Public Works of Yemen, Muhammad Mahdi Al-Lawrafi, called on Yemeni youth to learn from Li Wenjie's selfless spirit. He said, "The Chinese experts and technicians have set an example for us." The Yemeni worker Muhammad Ali, who worked with Li Wenjie, said, "Seeing Li Wenjie injured, I was so sad that I cried. Li Wenjie is too good to us."

When Li Wenjie heard these praises, he modestly said, "This is a small matter. Compared to heroes like Huang Jiguang, Dong Cunrui, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie, I am far behind."

Li Wenjie suffered extensive burns over his entire body. However, during his treatment, he cooperated well with the doctors. In the first few days after the burn, when his wounds were washed with saltwater, he never uttered a sound.

Li Wenjie comes from a poor peasant family. When the organization decided to send him to Yemen last March, he told the Party, "I will definitely follow the Party's instructions: wherever the Party points, I will rush to that direction. Whatever the revolution needs, I will do it."

Indeed, in less than a year since arriving in Yemen, he has been working selflessly and enthusiastically in every position.

Comrade Li Wenjie is a fearless proletarian internationalist warrior nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. He has repeatedly studied Mao Zedong's brilliant works, such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," with a strong sense of class. He said, "The more I read Chairman Mao's books, the more I enjoy them, and the more I want to read them. I always feel that I haven't learned enough." Although he was very busy in Yemen, he never neglected his ideological transformation. He studied Mao Zedong's works diligently and paid great attention to putting them into practice. He once said to someone, "Bethune was an ordinary foreigner, and Zhang Tiede was an ordinary revolutionary soldier. If they can do it, I can do it too."

After being injured while saving the roller machine, comrades asked him, "What were you thinking at that moment?" He said, "I have seen gasoline burns before, and I know how dangerous they are. But I thought, a soldier cannot lose his gun, and a worker cannot let the machine burn!"

After recovering from his injuries and returning to work, Li Wenjie studied Chairman Mao's works even more diligently and worked even harder. When talking about his understanding of the article "On the Chongqing Negotiations," he said, "Under those circumstances, Chairman Mao went to Chongqing for negotiations, risking his personal safety. Why? It was all for the hundreds of millions of Chinese people! Chairman Mao said: 'What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties.' This sentence points out a clear path for our lives and work."

He often said: The essence of the Chinese working class is not to fear difficulties and to find ways to overcome them. Li Wenjie, through his actions, fully demonstrated the lofty character of the working class.

    伟大毛泽东思想哺育的国际主义战士
    ——记援助也门的中国技工李文杰奋不顾身抢救机器的事迹
    今年二月四日，星期五，是信仰伊斯兰教的也门传统的礼拜日，荷台达港和首都萨那之间的公路修建工地上显得格外安静。中国援助也门修复这条公路的专家组技工李文杰和周孚龙，正利用休息日和也门徒工一起在公路旁边检查维修轧石机。
    一个也门徒工在用汽油洗刷柴油机的引擎时，不慎将包有铁皮的刷子触及电瓶马达的火线，引起失火，使放在轧石机下面的一大盆汽油熊熊地燃烧起来。如果不立即把火扑灭，远从祖国运来的轧石机和加满油的柴油机以及旁边放着的四桶柴油都会燃烧、爆炸，在机器下面工作的周孚龙就更危险了。在这个万分紧急的关头，共青团员李文杰奋不顾身，从轧石机上一跃而下，用手抱出着火的汽油盆，把它端离机器几米以外。
    火，扑灭了，机器保住了，一场严重的火灾避免了。可是，火却在身上沾满汽油的李文杰的身上、脖子上、胳臂和腿上燃烧起来。他忍受着烧伤皮肤的剧痛，在散搁着碎石的土地上接连来回打滚，才把身上的火滚灭了。
    当同志们赶来抢救和慰问他时，他说：“只要没有伤着也门朋友，没有烧着机器，我没有关系。”
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长曾打电报向李文杰表示慰问，热烈赞扬他不怕苦、不怕死的无产阶级忘我精神和革命英雄主义，为中国人民和世界人民服务的国际主义精神。
    也门公共工程部办公室总主任阿里也曾到医院探望李文杰，祝他早日恢复健康。
    也门人民也热烈赞扬李文杰的英勇事迹。同李文杰一起工作过的工路段长易卜拉欣说：“李文杰的这种精神使我们永远忘不了。中也两国人民的过去的共同遭遇和今天共同反帝斗争和建设各自国家的共同任务，使我们两国人民更密切地团结在一起了”。也门公共工程部办公室副主任穆罕默德·马赫迪·阿卢拉菲要求也门青年学习李文杰奋不顾身的精神。他说：“中国专家、技术人员给我们树立了榜样”。李文杰带的那位也门徒工穆罕默德·阿里说：“看到李文杰被烧伤，我难过得哭了。李文杰对我们太好了”。
    当李文杰听到这些赞誉时，他谦逊地说：“这点小事没什么。我同英雄黄继光、董存瑞、雷锋和王杰比起来，差远了。”
    李文杰全身烧伤面积很大。但在治疗过程中，他同医生们合作得很好。在烧伤的头几天，用盐水洗伤口时，他从不叫唤一声。
    李文杰出身于贫农家庭。当去年三月组织上要调他来也门时，他向党表示：“一定听党的话，像雷锋那样：党指向那里，就奔向那里，革命需要做什么，就做什么。”
    正是这样，他在来到也门不到一年的时间里，无论在什么岗位上，他都是热情忘我地进行工作。
    李文杰同志是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的不怕苦、不怕死的无产阶级国际主义战士，他带着强烈的阶级感情在实践中多次学习了毛主席的光辉著作：《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》等文章，他说：“毛主席的书，越读越有味道，越有味道越想读，老觉得学不够。”他在也门尽管工作很忙，但从不放松自己的思想改造，他刻苦学习毛主席著作，并且很注意在“用”字上下功夫。他曾对人说：“白求恩是一个普通的外国人，张思德也是一个普通的革命战士，他们能做到的，我也一定要做到。”
    这次抢救轧石机受伤后，同志们问他：“你当时是怎样想的呢？”他说：“汽油烧伤的事情，我亲眼看到过，我知道它的厉害。可是，我想的是，当兵的不能丢了枪，工人怎能让机器烧掉！”
    李文杰伤好恢复工作后，学习毛主席著作更加努力，工作更加刻苦。他在谈到学习《关于重庆谈判》这篇文章体会时说：“毛主席在那种情况下，不顾个人安危去重庆谈判，为了什么呢？还不是为了中国几亿人民！毛主席说：‘什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。’这句话给我们的生活和工作指出了一条明确的道路。”
    他常常说：中国工人阶级的本色就是不怕困难，想办法克服困难。李文杰用自己的行动，充分表现了工人阶级这种崇高的品德。
