Even with few people, we must propagate

During the Long March, the young cadres of the Shengpu Railway Middle School Long March Propaganda Team first propagated Mao Zedong Thought. Whenever there was an opportunity, they would propagate.

Once, the young cadres arrived at Baijia Dian Station, beating drums and striking gongs. After a long time, only three workers' family members carrying infants and a group of children came. They waited and waited, but no one else came. It turned out that everyone on the station had gone to the production team to help with drought relief. Should they perform or not? Someone muttered softly, "There are too few people. Performing would only waste time. It's better to move on." But they looked at the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands and the eager expressions of the family members, and felt they shouldn't leave. At this moment, 17-year-old Zhang Shun stood up, holding a erhu in his left hand and waving his right hand forcefully, loudly asking, "What is our mission for coming out?" The comrades in arms answered in unison, "We come out to propagate Mao Zedong Thought." Zhang Shun then asked, "Do the people need Mao Zedong Thought? Can we not propagate?" "No, we can't. Even if there is one person, we must propagate. One more person understanding Mao Zedong Thought brings one more bit of strength to the revolution." This was the unanimous response of all the comrades. The drums began to beat again, and the young cadres, full of spirit, sang "Chairman Mao Personally Drawn the Blueprint." The family members and children watched in awe. As soon as the performance ended, the three family members brought bowls of hot water to the young cadres' mouths. They pulled this one's hand, patted that one's shoulder, repeatedly saying, "You've worked hard. The performance spoke to our hearts." When the young cadres left and walked far away, looking back, the three family members were still standing at the roadside, waving in the wind.

Even if exhausted, we must propagate

Another day, they walked from Xuzhou to Han Zhuang, covering eighty li, performing three shows, and by evening, they reached the banks of Weishan Lake without having had lunch, truly hungry and tired. But looking at the vast Weishan Lake and thinking of the iron road guerrilla fighters of the past, they were spiritually invigorated and moved forward. As soon as the team entered the village, the children shouted, "The Red Guards Propaganda Team is here, come and see..." Some people ran over with bowls of rice, and some who had just gotten off the fishing boat also ran over, and in an instant, three or four hundred people gathered. The young cadres said to each other, "The revolutionary forerunners shed blood and toiled, we, for the sake of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, what is a little hunger and fatigue?" "Perform, perform, we must perform well. Not eating is fine, but not propagating Mao Zedong Thought is not acceptable." They put down their bags, took out the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and loudly shouted, "Comrades, open to the first page, first study a passage from Chairman Mao." Many fishermen took out their little red books and read aloud. The children also proudly recited along. The firm and powerful voices shook the entire village.

Workers love the Red Guards

It was a drizzly morning, and the young cadres were about to leave Han Zhuang Station. Five workers who had just finished their night shift hurried to see them off. The workers praised the young cadres' propaganda the previous night, saying, "After watching your performance, it's like a fire was lit in our hearts, bright and clear. We must better study Chairman Mao's works and propagate Mao Zedong Thought." They sent them off again and again. The young cadres repeatedly persuaded them, and just before parting, the worker comrades solemnly took out a red envelope from their pockets and gave it to the Red Guards. It was written, "Red Guards' hearts are connected, open it when you encounter difficulties." Team leader Yuan Guangshui carefully took it and hid it in his innermost pocket.

Later, one day, due to continuous marching and rehearsing performances, everyone hadn't slept well. Plus, it was hot, and by evening, everyone sat under a tree, truly exhausted. Someone suggested, "Let's open the letter and see."

"Yes, let's see the letter." The young cadres gathered around. The letter was opened, and it read in bright red characters, "Carry forward the spirit of bravery in battle, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." "Make up your mind, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The young cadres read it over and over. They seemed to see Chairman Mao standing by their side, and they seemed to see the worker comrades coming to see them off in the rain. A warm current spread throughout their bodies, and everyone shouted in unison, "March on!"

At one station, there was another incident. A young worker, on a business trip to Nan Sha He, heard that the Red Guards were coming to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, so he helped guide the way. He also arranged good food and lodging for the young cadres and then disappeared. After watching the performance, during the send-off, he held a paper package and a letter, excitedly saying, "This is my most precious item, given to you." After saying this, he turned and left. The young cadres opened the package, and their eyes lit up. It turned out to be a full-body plaster statue of Chairman Mao. The young cadres jumped and laughed, making a vow to Chairman Mao's statue: "Chairman Mao, we will cross mountains and rivers, spreading Mao Zedong Thought everywhere, illuminating all of China and the world in red."

    做毛泽东思想的宣传员
    ——蚌埠铁路中学“毛泽东思想长征宣传队”故事三则

    人少也要宣传
    在长征途中，蚌埠铁路中学长征宣传队的小将们首先做的事是宣传毛泽东思想。只要有机会，他们就进行宣传。
    有一次，小将们来到白家店车站，敲起锣，打起鼓，好一会儿，才来了三位抱着幼儿的职工家属和一群孩子。等啊，等，再也不见人来了。原来，站上的人都到生产队帮助抗旱去了。是演还是不演？有人低声咕哝着：“人太少了，演了反而耽误时间，不如往前走。”可是他们望望手中鲜红的《毛主席语录》，看看家属们渴望的神情，又觉得不该走。这时，十七岁的张顺站出来，左手提着二胡，右手用力地挥舞着，大声地问：“我们出来，任务是什么？”战友们异口同声：“我们出来宣传毛泽东思想。”张顺接着问：“人们需要毛泽东思想，我们能不能不宣传？”“不能，不能。有一个人也要宣传，多一个人掌握毛泽东思想，就给革命多带来一分力量。”这是全体同志的回答。鼓又重新敲响了，小将们精神抖擞，唱起了《毛主席亲手绘蓝图》。家属和孩子们看得出了神。演出刚结束，三个家属就把一碗碗的热水端到了小将的嘴边。他们拉拉这个手，摸摸那个肩，再三重复着：“你们辛苦了，演的节目说出了我们心里话。”当小将们离开这里，走出了很远，回头一望，三位家属还迎风站在路口。
    再累也要宣传
    另一天，他们从徐州往韩庄走，走了八十里地，演出了三场，到了傍晚，走到微山湖边，还没有吃午饭，真是又饿又累。但是望着浩荡的微山湖。想起了当年铁道游击队，他们精神振奋地又往前进。队伍一进庄，孩子们就叫：“红卫兵宣传队来了，快去看……”有人端着饭碗就跑来了，有人刚下渔船也跑来了，呼啦啦一下围了三四百人。小将们暗暗地说：“革命先辈抛头颅，洒热血，我们为了宣传毛泽东思想，饿点，累点怕什么？”“演，演，一定要演好，不吃饭可以，不宣传毛泽东思想不行。”他们撂下背包，掏出鲜红的《毛主席语录》，响亮地喊：“同志们，打开第一页，先学习一段毛主席语录。”很多渔民掏出了语录本，高声朗读。孩子们也跟着自豪地背诵着。坚定有力的声音，震动了整个山村。
    工人热爱红卫兵
    那是个细雨蒙蒙的清晨，小将们正准备离开韩庄车站，有五个工人刚下夜班，就赶来送行。工人们称赞小将昨晚的宣传说：“看了你们的演出，就像心里点了一把火，亮堂堂。我们要更好地学习毛主席著作，宣传毛泽东思想。”他们送了一程又一程。小将们再三劝阻，工人同志临分手前，郑重地从怀里掏出一个红信封送给红卫兵。上面写着“红卫兵战士心连心，遇到困难再拆开看。”队长袁广水小心翼翼地接过来，把它藏在最贴身的口袋里。
    后来有一天，由于连续行军，赶排节目，大家都没睡好觉。再加上天热，走到傍晚，大家在树底下一坐，真是精疲力尽。有人提议，“把信拆开看看吧。”
  “对，看看信吧。”小将们围在一起。信拆开了，只见纸上写着鲜红的字：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”小将们读了一遍又一遍。他们仿佛看见毛主席正站在身边，仿佛又看见工人同志们正冒雨来送行，一股暖流传遍了全身，大家齐声喊出一个字：“走！”
    在一个站上，还有一段事儿。有一个青年工人，到南沙河出差，听说红卫兵来宣传毛泽东思想，就帮着带路。他还帮着给小将张罗好食宿，就不见了。看了演出后，在送行的时候，他双手捧着一个纸包和一封信，激动地说：“这是我最珍贵的物品，送给你们。”说完转身就走。小将们打开纸包，眼前顿时一亮，原来是一座毛主席全身石膏塑像。小将们跳啊，笑啊，对着毛主席像立下誓言：毛主席啊毛主席，我们要越过千山万水，到处传播毛泽东思想，把全中国、全世界照得一片通红。
