The armed forces of the liberation movement in South Vietnam recently held their third guerrilla warfare conference. This conference summarized the rich experiences of the people's guerrilla warfare in South Vietnam, set up models, and decided to launch a campaign of learning, catching up, and surpassing, further unleashing the limitless power of people's war, and thoroughly defeating the American aggressors. We are deeply convinced that the results of this conference will lead to even more brilliant victories for the people's guerrilla warfare in South Vietnam.

Chairman Mao has succinctly summarized the strategy and tactics of people's war in four phrases: "You fight your way, I fight mine; when you can win, fight; when you can't win, retreat." A people's army that fights for the people's interests and relies on the broad masses of the people, employing such strategy and tactics, can always seize the initiative in war, can turn many small victories into a great victory, gradually develop and consolidate its own strength, change the situation between the enemy and ourselves, and ultimately defeat the enemy. The armed forces of the South Vietnamese people have grown stronger and more numerous in the process of annihilating and wearing down the American aggressors, fully demonstrating the immense power of people's war.

The people of South Vietnam are further developing and enriching the experiences of people's war in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. The experiences they have gained with their blood are also useful to the oppressed nations and peoples of the world. In the face of the South Vietnamese people, who dare to struggle and are good at struggling, no matter how many cannon fodders the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys add, or how many tricks they play, they can absolutely not save themselves from complete failure.

    人民战争威力无穷
    本报评论员
    越南南方解放武装力量，最近举行了第三次游击战争会议。这次会议总结了越南南方人民游击战争的丰富经验，树立了典型，决定开展学赶超竞赛运动，进一步发挥人民战争的无穷威力，彻底打败美国侵略强盗。我们深信，这次会议的成果，将使越南南方人民游击战争，取得更加辉煌的胜利。
    毛主席把人民战争的战略战术高度地概括为四句话：你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走。为人民利益而战、依靠广大人民群众的人民军队，实行这种战略战术，就能始终掌握战争的主动权，就能集合许多小胜化为大胜，逐步地发展和巩固自己的力量，转变敌我形势，最后战胜敌人。南越人民武装力量在歼灭和消耗美国侵略军的过程中不断壮大发展了自己，充分表现了人民战争的巨大威力。
    越南南方人民在抗美救国斗争中，正在进一步发展、丰富人民战争的经验。他们用鲜血换来的经验，对全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民，也是有用的。在敢于斗争、善于斗争的越南南方人民面前，不管美帝国主义和它的仆从走狗再增加多少炮灰，再玩弄多少花招，都绝对挽救不了它们彻底失败的命运。
