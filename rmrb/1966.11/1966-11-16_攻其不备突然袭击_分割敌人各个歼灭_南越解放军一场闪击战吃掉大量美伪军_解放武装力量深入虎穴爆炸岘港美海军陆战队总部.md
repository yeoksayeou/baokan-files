The Liberation Army of South Vietnam launched a swift and decisive battle on November 12 in the northwestern region of Bo La Giang, Kun Son Province, inflicting a heavy blow on the invading forces of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division and the puppet army of South Vietnam. The victory resulted in the complete annihilation of an American infantry battalion, an artillery company, an artillery platoon, and a puppet special forces company.

The report states that on November 11, the U.S. aggressors used helicopters to airlift a unit of the 4th Infantry Division to the western bank of the Ho Bo La Giang River, approximately 23 kilometers northwest of Bo La Giang, for a "sweeping" operation. Simultaneously, they dispatched a contingent of puppet special forces and some artillery units to support the operation.

On the afternoon of November 12, before the enemy could secure their positions, the Liberation Army seized the opportunity to launch a sudden and fierce attack with heavy artillery fire. The various calibers of artillery shells accurately struck the American command post, causing the enemy to be disoriented and confused. At this moment, the Liberation Army bravely charged into the enemy's camp, dividing the American invaders into small groups and annihilating them one by one. They also destroyed an entire company of puppet special forces.

The American invaders' artillery and mortar positions were completely disabled by the Liberation Army's artillery fire. Many cannons were destroyed before they could even be fired.

The Liberation Army also shot down seven American aggressor aircraft that were sent to reinforce the enemy, including five helicopters, one fighter jet, and one reconnaissance plane.

According to Western news agencies, after suffering a heavy blow from the Liberation Army on November 12, the U.S. invaders were terrified and feared further attacks. They dispatched several American companies to "search" the area. On the afternoon of November 13, as a company from the 25th Infantry Division was moving towards the western part of Bo La Giang, they were ambushed by the Liberation Army. Several American soldiers were killed and wounded. The Associated Press reported that the losses of this 200-man company were so severe that it was no longer a combat-ready unit.

Xinhua News Agency, November 15: Saigon news: On the night of November 14, the Liberation Army of South Vietnam successfully detonated explosives at the headquarters of the U.S. Marine Corps in Da Nang, causing severe damage to the enemy's stronghold. The U.S. Marine Corps commander, Walter, narrowly escaped death.

According to Western news agencies, the explosion occurred at the center of the Marine Corps base, near a building where weapons and ammunition were stored. The American aggressors admitted that on November 14, there were "several medium-sized explosions" inside the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters.

Another report stated that a U.S. military ammunition depot in the eastern part of Da Nang was also bombed on November 13. Western news agencies reported that the explosion "completely destroyed" the ammunition depot.

Under the fierce attacks of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, the U.S. aggressors suffered heavy casualties and were in a state of disarray.

    攻其不备突然袭击　分割敌人各个歼灭
    南越解放军一场闪击战吃掉大量美伪军
    解放武装力量深入虎穴爆炸岘港美海军陆战队总部
    据新华社河内十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量十二日在昆嵩省波来吉浪西北地区再次痛击美国第四步兵师的侵略军和南越伪军，取得全歼美军一个步兵营、一个炮兵连、一个炮兵排和伪军一个别动连的重大胜利。
    报道说，十一月十一日，美国侵略者用直升飞机把第四步兵师的一支部队空降到离波来吉浪西北约二十三公里的赫波来河西部地区“扫荡”，同时还派遣一股伪别动队和一些炮兵部队配合作战。
    十二日下午五时，当敌军还没有站稳脚跟的时候，解放武装力量便抓住这一有利战机，用猛烈的炮火向敌人发动迅雷不及掩耳的突然进攻。解放武装力量的各种口径的炮弹，准确地射向美军指挥所，打得敌人蒙头转向，茫然不知所措。这时，解放武装力量英勇地冲进敌人阵地，把美国侵略军分割成许多小块，逐个加以歼灭，同时还歼灭伪别动队一个整连。
    美国侵略军的大炮和迫击炮阵地也被解放武装力量的炮火打得完全瘫痪。许多大炮还没有打响就被击毁。
    解放武装力量还当场打落前往增援的美国强盗飞机七架（其中包括直升飞机五架，战斗机和侦察机各一架）。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国侵略军在十二日遭到解放武装力量的痛击后，胆战心惊，深怕解放武装力量再要发动进攻，于是派遣一些美军连四出“搜索”。十三日中午，当第二十五步兵师的一个连正在向波来吉浪西部移动时，遭到解放武装力量的截击，一些美军被打死打伤。合众国际社的消息透露，这个有二百个人的连的损失是“如此之重”，以致“不复再是一支能够作战的部队了”。
    新华社十五日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量十四日晚上成功地爆炸了美国海军陆战队的岘港总部，使敌人的巢穴遭到严重破坏。美国海军陆战队头目沃尔特险些丧命。
    据西方通讯社报道，这次爆炸正好发生在海军陆战队基地中心，在放武器和弹药的一座房屋旁边“发现放了好几个炸药包”。基地的美国侵略者承认，十四日，在美海军陆战队总部里“发生了好几次中级爆炸”。
    另据报道，岘港东部的一座美军武器库十三日也发生了爆炸。西方通讯社的消息说，爆炸结果“把这个武器库完全炸毁了”。（附图片）
