Chairman Mao said: “This cooperative of three poor peasant households has had a great impact on the rural areas of the entire country in the past few months. Everyone knows that there is such a remarkable heroic cooperative in Hebei Province, which has given the poor peasants courage.”

Ten years ago, the cooperative of three poor peasant households in Nanwang Village, Hebei Province, which was highly praised by Chairman Mao, is now the Nanwang Brigade of the Nanwang Commune with over three hundred households. Over the past ten years, it has truly been a shining red banner for upholding the socialist collective economy.

In 1954, Nanwang Village established an initial-level cooperative with seventy-eight households. Due to the sabotage by rich middle peasants, it quickly split into seven small cooperatives, and then six of them dissolved, leaving only the six-household small cooperative of poor peasants Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, Wang Xiaopang, and three other middle peasant households.

When the wheat was ripening, the three middle peasant households saw that their wheat was growing well and also withdrew. At this critical moment of difficulty, Wang Yukun firmly said: “Chairman Mao thinks big and looks far ahead, and he is right. Chairman Mao wants us to organize, so we must organize. If they don’t do it, we will.” With this, Xiaoqi and Xiaopang also became spirited. Xiaoqi said: “Let them dissolve if they want to. We three will definitely not dissolve again.” Xiaopang said: “Let Yukun be the director, Xiaoqi be the accountant, and I will be the production team leader. If they don’t do it, we will still do it.”

This news reached Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao highly praised the heroic deeds of these three poor peasant households in his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization": “The direction shown by these three poor peasants is the direction of the five hundred million peasants of the entire country. All individual peasant households will eventually follow the path that these three poor peasants have resolutely chosen.”

Chairman Mao’s words greatly encouraged and strengthened these three poor peasants. That autumn, the small cooperative of three poor peasants demonstrated the superiority of the collective economy, increasing the yield per mu from the usual hundred catties to one hundred and seventy-five catties, surpassing all individual households in the village. That winter, all the peasants of Nanwang Village joined the cooperative, and the initial-level cooperative was transformed into a higher-level cooperative.

The cooperative developed and grew stronger, but the class struggle continued.

In the autumn of 1960, a rich peasant element in Nanwang Village spread the wind of individual farming on the main street, advocating the system of contracting production to the group and labor to the household, and feeding livestock by the group. The Party branch seized this issue and educated all Party and League members to recognize that so-called “contracting production to the group and labor to the household” was essentially individual farming and taking the capitalist road. The Party’s education raised everyone’s awareness and resisted this individual farming trend.

Nanwang Village’s oil mill processed cotton seeds, originally only charging a processing fee. Someone suggested buying cotton seeds to press oil, making money and fertilizer cakes at the same time. When this was discussed at the cadre meeting, some thought that buying cotton seeds to press oil was of a commercial nature and reflected capitalist management thinking. Others said, for the sake of collective production, it’s not speculation, so what’s wrong with it? Wang Yukun said: “Let’s study first.” Everyone then studied Chairman Mao’s discussions on class struggle and Party policies, clarifying the minds of those who were previously confused and avoiding a directional error.

Over the past ten years, Nanwang Village has changed every year, but the extent of the changes has varied. The poor and lower-middle peasant members of Nanwang Village deeply felt that the more they studied Chairman Mao’s works, the more vigorous their revolutionary spirit, the greater their enthusiasm, and the faster their production developed.

In 1963, Nanwang Village suffered a severe flood disaster. At that time, some cadres and members had a pessimistic attitude. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanwang Village, with the question of whether to overcome difficulties or yield to them, studied Chairman Mao’s works. “Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage.” Chairman Mao’s words greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanwang Village. The fields were flooded and rebuilt, the pens and sheds were destroyed and reconstructed, and life was difficult, but they self-relied. People’s spiritual appearance changed, and the material production appearance followed. After a year of hard struggle, they completely healed the wounds of the flood disaster and achieved a good harvest of five hundred and forty-five catties of grain per mu.

The hard struggle of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanwang Village won them the title of advanced, but this advancement also became a mental burden for some people. Some cadres and members thought that it was not easy for Nanwang Village to reach the current level of production. As long as this level was maintained, it would be fine. Therefore, many places in production that should be reformed were not actively reformed. Nanwang Village had over five hundred mu of cultivated land to the south of the village. After the establishment of the cooperative, it was always planted with cotton. People clearly knew that it was time to rotate crops, but they dared not, always fearing that if cotton fields were rotated with other crops, the yield would decrease, and they would lose face, so it was better to maintain the status quo and be stable.

In the winter of 1964 and the spring of 1965, the Party branch led the entire brigade to study Chairman Mao’s works and conducted a major debate, criticizing the conservative thinking of merely maintaining the status quo and not daring to continue the revolution. They carried out a series of reforms in agricultural production, and production further developed.

After the autumn harvest last year, the Party branch of Nanwang Brigade guided the commune members to recall and compare. In 1942, they suffered a drought disaster, and eighty households went begging, several households sold their wives and daughters, and thirteen people starved to death. Last year was also a severe drought year with over three hundred days without rain. Due to the Party’s leadership, the state’s support, and the collective’s strength, they achieved a bumper harvest. With one recall and one comparison, the commune members of Nanwang Village loved the Party, Chairman Mao, and the socialist society even more. They proposed four things not to forget: do not forget where the current happy life comes from, do not forget the Party and Chairman Mao, do not forget class and class struggle, and do not forget that three-thirds of the laboring people in the world are not yet liberated. They must always insist on studying Chairman Mao’s works and always follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

### 英雄合作社在阶级斗争中成长

    英雄合作社在阶级斗争中成长
    毛主席说：“这个三户贫农的合作社，几个月以来，在全国农村中产生了很大的影响，大家都知道河北省有这么一个了不起的英雄的合作社，给贫农壮了胆。”
    十年前受到毛主席高度赞扬的河北省南王庄三户贫农的合作社，现在是南王庄公社的三百多户的南王庄大队。十年来，它不愧为坚持社会主义集体经济的一面光辉的红旗。
    一九五四年，南王庄成立了一个七十八户的初级社。由于富裕中农的捣乱，很快就化成了七个小社，接着又散了六个，最后只剩下贫农王玉坤、王小其、王小庞和另外三户中农的一个六户的小社了。
    到麦子黄梢的时候，三户中农见自己地里的麦子长得好，也退出去了。就在这个困难的关键时刻，王玉坤坚定地说：“毛主席想得大，看得远，量事没错。毛主席让咱们组织起来，就要组织起来，他们不干，咱们干。”这样一讲，小其、小庞也鼓起劲来了。小其说：“他们散让他们散，咱三个，反正不能再散了。”小庞说：“玉坤给咱当社长，小其当会计，我当生产队长，他们不干，咱们照样干。”
    这个消息传到毛主席那里，毛主席就在《关于农业合作化问题》的报告中，对这三户贫农坚持办社的英雄事迹作了极高的评价：“这三户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国五亿农民的方向。一切个体经营的农民，终归是要走这三户贫农所坚决地选择了的道路的。”
    毛主席的话给这三户贫农极大的鼓舞和力量。这年秋后，三户贫农的小社，显示了集体经济的优越性，把一向百斤上下的亩产量提高到了一百七十五斤，赛过了村里所有的单干户。这年冬天，南王庄的农民全体入了社，并把初级社转成了高级社。
    合作社发展了，壮大了，阶级斗争还在继续着。
    一九六○年秋后，一个富农分子在南王庄的大街上刮单干风，说实行包产到组，包工到户，牲口分组喂养办法好。党支部抓住这个问题，教育全体党团员认识所谓“包产到组，包工到户”，实质上是要单干，是走资本主义道路。党的教育提高了大家的认识，顶住了这股单干风。
    南王庄油房加工棉籽，本来只收加工费，有人建议自己买棉籽榨油，既赚钱又赚饼肥。到干部会上研究的时候，有人认为买棉籽榨油属于商业性质，是资本主义经营思想。也有人说，为了集体生产，又不是投机倒把，怕什么呢？王玉坤说：“来，咱先学习学习吧。”大家就学习毛主席关于阶级斗争和党的政策的论述，使原来认识模糊的人头脑清醒了，避免了一次方向性的错误。
    十年来，南王庄每年都有变化，但是变化的大小却不一样。南王庄的贫农下中农社员深深体会到，什么时候学习毛主席的著作最好，什么时候的革命精神就最旺盛，干劲就最大，生产的发展也就最快。
    一九六三年南王庄遭受了严重水灾，当时部分干部社员有悲观情绪。南王庄的贫农下中农在党支部的领导下，带着是战胜困难还是向困难低头的问题，学习毛主席著作。“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的话，大大鼓舞了南王庄贫农下中农的斗志，园田冲坏了，重整，圈、棚冲毁了，重修，生活有困难，自救。人的精神面貌变了，物质生产面貌也就跟着变。经过一年的苦斗，就完全治好了涝灾的创伤，夺得了粮食亩产五百四十五斤的好收成。
    南王庄贫下中农的艰苦奋斗赢得了先进，可是先进又成了一些人的思想包袱。有些干部和社员认为，南王庄能够达到目前的生产水平，已经不容易了。只要保住这个水平，就行了。因此，生产上许多应当改革的地方，也不积极改革。南王庄村南有五百多亩耕地，建社后总是种棉花。人们明明知道该倒茬了，可是不敢，总怕棉花地倒种别的庄稼，减了产，丢了人，不如维持现状，稳稳当当。
    一九六四年冬和一九六五年春，党支部领导全大队学习毛主席著作，进行了一场大辩论，批判了只是维持现状，不敢继续革命的保守思想，在农业生产上进行了一系列改革，生产也就得到了进一步的发展。
    去年秋收结束后，南王庄大队党支部引导社员回忆对比。一九四二年遭了旱灾，外出讨饭的就有八十户，卖妻卖女的有十几户，饿死了十三口人。去年又是三百多天没下透雨的大旱之年，由于党的领导，国家的支持，集体的力量，夺得了大丰收。一忆一比，南王庄的社员更加热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义社会。他们提出了四不忘：不要忘记现在的幸福生活是哪里来的，不要忘记党和毛主席，不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争，不要忘记世界上还有三分之二的劳动人民没有解放。要永远坚持学习毛主席著作，永远跟着毛主席干革命。
