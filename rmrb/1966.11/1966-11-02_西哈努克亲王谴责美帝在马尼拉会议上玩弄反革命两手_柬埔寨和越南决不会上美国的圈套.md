Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia denounces U.S. imperialism's two-faced counter-revolutionary tactics at the Manila Conference
Cambodia and Vietnam will never fall into the U.S. trap

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 1 (New China News Agency) -- In a speech delivered on Oct. 29, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, denounced the U.S. policy of playing the "carrot and stick" game in its dealings with Vietnam and other Asian countries.

	Prince Sihanouk said that at the Manila Conference, the U.S. "wants the Vietnamese people to give up their complete independence, their right to self-determination, and even their resolve to unify their own country." He pointed out that for such an unacceptable goal, the U.S. is playing the "carrot and stick" game.

	He went on to say that at the same Manila Conference, the U.S. shamelessly peddled this "carrot" policy to the neighboring countries of Vietnam, aiming to place Southeast Asia under the evil new colonialist rule of imperialists from across the Pacific.

	Prince Sihanouk said, "It is certain that neither the Kingdom of Cambodia and its people nor the Vietnamese people will accept such a dishonorable gift."

	In his speech, Prince Sihanouk stressed that Cambodia "will forever resist imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism from wherever they come, no matter what the cost of such resistance may be."

    西哈努克亲王谴责美帝在马尼拉会议上玩弄反革命两手
    柬埔寨和越南决不会上美国的圈套
    新华社金边三十一日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王在二十九日发表的一次讲话中，谴责美国在越南问题上和向亚洲国家玩弄“胡萝卜”和“大棒”的反革命两手政策。
    西哈努克亲王说，美国在马尼拉会议上“要越南人民放弃完全的独立，放弃他们的自决权，甚至放弃统一自己祖国的决心。”他指出，为了这样一种不可接受的目的，美国正在玩弄“胡萝卜”和“大棒”政策。
    他接着指出，美国在同一个马尼拉会议上，竟然无耻地向越南的邻国也推销这种“胡萝卜”政策，以便把东南亚地区置于“来自太平洋彼岸”的帝国主义者的罪恶的新殖民主义统治之下。
    西哈努克亲王说，“可以肯定，无论是柬埔寨王国和它的人民还是越南人民，都不会接受这样不光彩的赠品。”
    西哈努克亲王在讲话中强调，柬埔寨“永远要反抗不论来自哪里的帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义，不管这种抵抗会付出多少代价。”
