November 12th marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a great pioneer of China's democratic revolution. He dedicated his life to the struggle against imperialism and feudalism. He played an outstanding role in modern Chinese history. We commemorate him with boundless admiration.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "During the preparatory period of the Chinese democratic revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen took a clear stand as a Chinese revolutionary democrat and waged a sharp struggle against the Chinese reformists. In this struggle, he was the banner of the Chinese revolutionary democrats." Dr. Sun Yat-sen began his revolutionary activities at the end of the 19th century, when China was entering a great era of change. On the one hand, China was being exploited, oppressed, and carved up by all the imperialists in the world. The foreign imperialists and the Chinese feudal forces colluded with each other to rule China and wanted to keep the Chinese people in a state of permanent slavery. On the other hand, the Chinese people were awakening and were continuously waging a struggle against imperialism and feudal forces. It was at this critical historical juncture that Dr. Sun Yat-sen stood on the side of the revolutionary people and waged a resolute struggle against all kinds of monarchists and reformists. He advocated the use of revolutionary means to overthrow the autocratic emperor and establish a democratic republic. He organized and led several armed uprisings. Through the Xinhai Revolution, he finally ended China's more than two-thousand-year-old feudal imperial system, making an immortal contribution to the modern Chinese democratic revolution.

After the Xinhai Revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the struggle against Yuan Shikai and the northern and southern warlords. He experienced a very difficult and tortuous road, learned from many failures, and gradually realized that to overthrow imperialism and feudal forces, one must rely on genuine revolutionary forces. Especially after the October Revolution of the Russian proletariat and the emergence of the Chinese proletariat on the historical stage, with the help of the Communist Party of China, he bravely carried out a major transformation that was "in line with the world trend and the needs of the people." He developed the old Three People's Principles into the new Three People's Principles, proposed the famous three policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and aid to workers and peasants, reorganized the Kuomintang, and waged a resolute struggle against the right-wing bourgeoisie that opposed these proposals. He firmly and unshakably cooperated with the Communist Party of China. Thus, the great revolution from 1924 to 1927 emerged, which was another great achievement of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the Chinese democratic revolution.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life was a life of struggle for the liberation and democracy of China. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was great not only because he fought tirelessly for the revolution all his life, but also because he had a far-sighted vision and made continuous progress. At every major turning point in the revolution, he could stand with the broad masses of the people, making his thoughts and policies adapt to the needs and requirements of historical development. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of continuous progress with the times is an important factor in his ability to make significant contributions to modern Chinese history. Although Dr. Sun Yat-sen was not a scientific socialist or a Marxist, he dared to make a revolution, dared to oppose imperialism, and dared to wage armed struggle, which is something that the old revisionists who kowtowed to imperialism and the modern revisionists cannot compare with.

Today, as we commemorate the 100th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, we are greatly excited to see that our motherland has undergone tremendous changes. Under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have not only thoroughly completed the democratic revolution that Dr. Sun Yat-sen did not complete but have also achieved decisive victories in the socialist revolution and made brilliant achievements in socialist construction. Now the whole country is in the midst of a surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is a new stage of deeper and broader development of the socialist revolution in our country. The people of China are fighting with high spirits to sweep away all the corrupt old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left over from the old world and make their own brilliant contribution to opening up a new era in human history. Chairman Mao taught us seventeen years ago, "The Chinese people will see that once the fate of China is in the hands of the people themselves, China will shine like the rising sun in the east and illuminate the world with its brilliant radiance..." Now a great new China not only stands tall in the East but has also become the center and stronghold of the world people's revolution. All this is the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Chairman Mao is not only the most beloved leader of the Chinese people but also the most beloved leader of the revolutionary people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the brightest red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people but also the brightest red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. We must take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all our work. We must enthusiastically respond to the great call of Comrade Lin Biao and earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must thoroughly criticize all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes and thoroughly establish the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat, which is to thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought.

Human history is an unceasing march forward. In the face of the advancing wheel of history, a small handful of people who resist revolution will inevitably be eliminated. We are facing a great era and must learn from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of continuous progress, constantly reform our thinking, and keep up with the rapidly developing situation. We must always follow the Communist Party, always follow Chairman Mao, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! We must carry the socialist revolution through to the end!

    学习孙中山先生不断进步的革命精神
    熊克武
    十一月十二日是孙中山先生诞生一百周年纪念日。孙中山先生是我国民主革命伟大的先行者，他毕生致力于反对帝国主义和封建主义的斗争。他在中国近代历史上起过卓越的作用。我们怀着无限敬仰的心情来纪念他。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说，孙中山先生“在中国民主革命准备时期，以鲜明的中国革命民主派立场，同中国改良派作了尖锐的斗争。他在这一场斗争中是中国革命民主派的旗帜。”孙中山先生是在十九世纪末开始他的革命活动的，当时中国正进入一个大变动的时代。一方面，中国正受着世界上所有帝国主义的剥削，压迫和宰割，外国帝国主义和中国封建势力相勾结，统治着中国，想使中国人民永远处于被奴役的地位；一方面中国人民大众正在觉醒，正在不断开展反对帝国主义和封建势力的斗争。就在这个历史转变关头，孙中山先生站在革命人民一边，同形形色色的保皇派、改良派进行了坚决的斗争，并且主张用革命的手段推翻专制皇帝，建立民主共和国。他组织和领导了多次武装起义，经过辛亥革命，终于结束了中国两千多年的封建帝制，对中国近代民主革命，建立了不朽的功绩。
    在辛亥革命以后，孙中山先生领导进行了反对袁世凯，反对南北军阀的斗争，经历了十分艰难曲折的道路，接受了多次失败的教训，使他逐步认识到要打倒帝国主义和封建势力，必须依靠真正的革命力量。特别是在俄国无产阶级十月革命和中国无产阶级登上了历史舞台以后，在中国共产党的帮助下，他勇敢地实行了一个“适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要”的重大转变，把旧三民主义发展为新三民主义，提出了著名的联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策，改组了国民党，并且和反对这些主张的资产阶级右派进行了坚决的斗争，坚定不移地同中国共产党合作，这样，就出现了一九二四年到一九二七年的轰轰烈烈的大革命，这是孙中山先生在中国民主革命过程中所建立的又一个伟大的功绩。
    孙中山先生的一生，是为中国的解放和民主自由而斗争的一生。孙中山先生之所以伟大，不仅在于他终生为革命奋斗不懈，更在于他眼光远大，不断进步，在革命发展的每一个重大关头，能够同广大人民站在一起，使他的思想和政策，适合于历史发展的需要和要求。孙中山先生这种随着时代不断进步的精神，是他能够对近代中国历史作出重大贡献的重要因素。孙中山先生虽然不是科学的社会主义者，不是马克思主义者，但是他敢于革命，敢于反对帝国主义，敢于进行武装斗争，是那些向帝国主义屈膝投降的老修正主义者们，现代修正主义者们根本不能比拟的。
    今天，当我们纪念孙中山先生诞生一百周年的时候，我们无比兴奋地看到，我们祖国已经发生了翻天覆地的变化。中国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，不仅彻底完成了孙中山先生没有完成的民主革命，并且取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利，取得了社会主义建设的辉煌成就。现在全国正处在热火朝天的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，这是我国社会主义革命发展的一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。我国人民正在斗志昂扬地涤荡着旧世界遗留下来的一切腐朽的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，为开创人类历史的新纪元作出自己的光辉贡献。毛主席在十七年前教导我们，“中国人民将会看见，中国的命运一经操在人民自己的手里，中国就将如太阳升起在东方那样，以自己的辉煌的光焰普照大地……”。现在一个伟大的新中国，不但已经屹立在世界的东方，而且已经成为世界人民革命的中心和坚强的堡垒。这一切都是毛主席英明领导的结果，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利！毛主席不只是中国人民最敬爱的领袖，而且是世界革命人民最敬爱的领袖。毛泽东思想不仅是我国人民心中最红最红的红太阳，而且是全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。我们必须以毛泽东思想作为我们一切工作的指导方针。必须热烈地响应林彪副主席的伟大号召，认真地活学活用毛主席的著作，大破一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，大立无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，也就是要大立毛泽东思想。
    人类历史是永不停止地前进的。在前进的历史车轮面前，总是要把一小撮抗拒革命的人淘汰掉的。我们面临着伟大的时代，一定要学习孙中山先生那种不断进步的精神，不断改造自己的思想，跟上飞跃发展的形势。我们要永远跟着共产党，永远跟着毛主席，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！把社会主义革命进行到底！
