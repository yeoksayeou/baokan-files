The first Asian New Emerging Forces Games have just begun, and various competitions are underway. However, the new style, new appearance, and new spirit displayed by Chinese athletes armed with Mao Zedong Thought have already received high praise from Cambodian friends and athletes from various countries.

Decisive Action to Save Others at the Risk of One's Own Safety

On the morning of the 19th, Chinese female cyclist Fang Guirong and her teammates were practicing on the cycling track, racing against each other. As she crossed the bend and sped forward, she suddenly saw a Cambodian child about four or five meters ahead on the track. Fang Guirong was startled: if she continued straight ahead, the child would be in danger; if she tried to stop, the racing bike had no brakes, what should she do? In that critical moment, Fang Guirong made a decisive choice:

"Rather be injured myself, but protect this lovely Cambodian child!" She quickly turned the handlebars to the left, the bicycle lost balance, and she fell heavily from the bike, injuring her head and losing consciousness. Her teammates quickly took Fang Guirong to the hospital. When she regained consciousness, her first question was: "How is the child?" She was told that the child had only a slight scratch on the face, and Fang Guirong then smiled and went to sleep peacefully.

The story of Fang Guirong's selfless act of saving the child spread widely. On the 23rd, Fang Guirong was discharged from the hospital after receiving careful treatment and care from Cambodian medical staff. She humbly said:

"White sought to save the Chinese people and gave his life, I got injured to protect a Cambodian child, this is nothing."

Loving Labor and Being Approachable

The University of the People's Socialist Alliance in Phnom Penh is where female athletes from various countries are staying. Every day, enthusiastic Cambodian service staff would go to each room to collect and wash clothes. However, they found no laundry in the rooms of the Chinese female athletes. This was the case on the first day, the second day, and every day. Later, they discovered that the Chinese athletes washed their own clothes. This deeply moved the Cambodian service staff.

Once, a Cambodian female service staff member was moving a large cabinet and was about to call for male service staff to help, but the Chinese female athletes, upon hearing this, rushed over to help move it.

The Cambodian service staff knew that the Chinese sports delegation was a very strong team in the world, with many world-class athletes among the female athletes, yet they were so approachable.

Not only that, but Chinese male and female athletes and staff members also served themselves food during meals. On various competition venues, people often saw Chinese athletes helping the hosts clean the site. This spirit of loving labor deeply moved Cambodian friends and athletes from various countries. Some athletes from other countries, seeing the Chinese athletes do this, also followed suit.

Rather Lose a Ball Than Injure a Person

During the China vs. Palestine football match on the evening of the 26th, both sides were fiercely competing, but the match was filled with deep friendship. At one point, the Chinese athlete Hu Denghui had passed the ball to a position very close to the opponent's goal and was about to make a powerful shot. At this critical moment, the Palestinian goalkeeper pounced forward and fell to the ground. If Hu Denghui had kicked the ball at that moment, the goalkeeper might have been injured. Therefore, Hu Denghui immediately withdrew his leg, stopped the shooting action, and nimbly jumped over the Palestinian goalkeeper. The Chinese athletes' noble action of rather losing a ball than injuring a person deeply moved the Palestinian friends and won the enthusiastic applause of the entire audience. Many Cambodian friends and athletes from various countries praised, "The Chinese athletes are truly noble people brought up by Chairman Mao!"

    毛主席教导出来的高尚的人
    ——中国运动员在亚洲新兴力量运动会上的故事
    第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会刚刚开始，各项比赛正在紧张进行，但用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国运动员们所表现出来的新风格、新面貌、新精神，已经受到了柬埔寨朋友和各国运动员的高度赞扬。
    当机立断舍己救人
    那是十九日清晨，中国女自行车运动员房桂荣和她的战友们正在自行车场上你追我赶地进行练习。当她跨过弯道，加速前进时，前面四五米远的跑道上突然出现了一个柬埔寨儿童。房桂荣不禁一惊：直冲过去，小孩就有危险；想停车，赛车是没有制动器的，怎么办呢？在这紧急的一刹那，房桂荣当机立断：
  “宁肯自己负伤，也要保护这个可爱的柬埔寨儿童！”她赶紧向左扭动车把，自行车失去了平衡，人从车子上重重地摔了下来，头部受伤，顿时失去了知觉。同伴们很快把房桂荣送进了医院。当她清醒过来时，首先问道：“那个小孩怎样？”别人告诉她，小孩只是脸上划破了一点皮，房桂荣才宽慰地含笑入睡了。
    房桂荣舍己救人的事迹被广泛地流传开来。二十三日，房桂荣在柬埔寨医护人员的精心治疗护理下伤愈出院了。她谦虚地表示：
  “白求恩为了中国人民献出了生命，我为了保护柬埔寨小孩而受了点伤，这算不了什么。”
    热爱劳动　平易近人
    金边人民社会同盟大学是各国女运动员集中居住的地方，每天，热情的柬埔寨服务员都要到各个房间取换下来的衣服洗。可是，她们到中国女运动员住的房间，却一件换洗衣服也找不到。第一天是这样，第二天也是这样，一直都是这样。后来她们才发现，中国运动员都是自己洗衣服。这使柬埔寨的服务员非常感动。
    有一次，柬埔寨女服务员要搬一个大柜子，正准备找男服务员帮忙，中国女运动员知道了，一拥上前去帮助搬。
    柬埔寨的服务员都知道，中国体育代表团是世界上一支实力很强的运动队伍，女运动员中有不少世界名手，然而她们是那样平易近人。
    不仅如此，中国男女运动员和工作人员在吃饭的时候，都是自己取饭菜。在各个比赛场地上，人们也常常看见中国运动员在帮主人清理场地。这种热爱劳动的精神，使柬埔寨朋友和各国运动员十分感动。其他国家的一些运动员看到中国运动员这样做，也跟着做起来。
    宁失一球不伤一人
    在二十六日晚上中国对巴勒斯坦的足球比赛中，双方争夺非常激烈，但却充满着深厚的友谊。有一次，中国运动员已把球传到离对方球门很近的地方，中国运动员胡登辉正准备作猛力射门的动作。在这紧急的时刻，巴勒斯坦的守门员猛扑过来，并倒在地上。这时，胡登辉如果举脚射球，这位守门员很可能受伤，于是胡登辉马上收腿，停止射门动作，敏捷地从巴勒斯坦守门员身上跳过。中国运动员这种宁可失一球，决不伤一人的高尚的行动，使巴勒斯坦朋友深受感动，并博得了全场观众的热烈掌声。不少柬埔寨朋友和各国运动员都赞扬说：“中国运动员不愧是毛泽东教导出来的高尚的人！”
