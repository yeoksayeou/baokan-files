The Bulgarian revisionist leadership clique, in order to follow the Soviet revisionist leadership clique in its anti-China stance, has recently taken a series of discriminatory actions against the Xinhua News Agency's correspondent in Sofia, brutally stripping the Xinhua correspondent of the right to cover the Ninth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

On November 12, the Bulgarian side held a press conference for the BCP's Ninth Congress, but did not invite the Xinhua correspondent to attend. That day, the Xinhua correspondent called the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Press Bureau multiple times to inquire about covering the BCP's Ninth Congress, but the other party evaded the question. It was not until 7 PM that evening that they notified our correspondent that they could go to the BCP's Ninth Congress press center to pick up the entry pass for the opening ceremony of the Congress.

On the morning of the 13th, at the BCP's Ninth Congress press center, the head of the Foreign Press Section of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Press Bureau, Dinkov, issued an entry pass for the Xinhua correspondent to cover the opening ceremony of the BCP's Ninth Congress. Our correspondent immediately questioned him why he did not issue an entry pass and relevant materials for the Xinhua correspondent to cover the BCP's Ninth Congress. Dinkov actually claimed: "The central directive is not to issue passes to Chinese journalists." Our correspondent immediately protested this discriminatory behavior on the spot.

That evening at 8:45 PM, two people claiming to be "staff from the Central Propaganda Department of the BCP" came to the Xinhua News Agency's Sofia branch office and told our correspondent: "There is an error in the entry pass for the opening ceremony of the BCP's Ninth Congress that we issued to you, and it needs to be corrected; otherwise, you will have difficulty entering tomorrow." But after they took our correspondent's entry pass, they changed their tune and said: "Because your party did not send a delegation to participate in our party's Ninth Congress, our central decision is to withdraw your entry pass." They finished speaking and left. At that time, our correspondent was very indignant at the Bulgarian side's despicable behavior, not letting them leave, and called the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately send someone to handle the matter, but they delayed sending someone. After three phone calls urging them, it was not until 10 PM that the Bulgarian side sent three Ministry of Internal Affairs officials. These people claimed to be there to "handle the problem." Although they admitted that the BCP Central Committee had sent two people to the Xinhua News Agency's Sofia branch, the names they provided did not match the names of the two unidentified individuals who had introduced themselves. Therefore, the Xinhua correspondent had to call the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs again to urge them to send someone to the scene to handle the matter. But the other party delayed again and again, and it was not until 1:05 AM the next morning, after the correspondent's continuous six phone calls urging them, that a representative was sent to the Xinhua branch.

The Xinhua correspondent explained the situation to the representative of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and protested the Bulgarian side's use of illegal means to deceive the Xinhua correspondent into handing over the entry pass for the opening ceremony of the BCP's Ninth Congress. The representative of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the director of the Fifth Bureau, Petef, said on the spot: "These two people were sent by our central committee, but they made mistakes in their execution..." and so on, and expressed that he would take these two people back to handle the matter.

However, what is intolerable is that the representative of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs still used the excuse that the Communist Party of China did not send a delegation to participate in the BCP's Ninth Congress to forcibly take back the official entry pass issued to the Xinhua correspondent to attend the opening ceremony of the BCP's Ninth Congress. The Xinhua correspondent expressed great indignation at the Bulgarian side's behavior of going back on their word and seriously discriminating against our journalists and protested again.

On the afternoon of the 16th, Chinese Ambassador to Bulgaria Xie Bangzhi lodged a serious protest with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Baseshev over the Bulgarian side's despicable behavior. Xie Bangzhi pointed out: "Your flip-flopping, stripping the Xinhua correspondent of the right to conduct normal reporting activities, is a vicious act of serious discrimination against Chinese journalists, a serious incident of serving the Soviet revisionists in their anti-China stance and worsening relations between the two countries. Your excuses are absurd, and your methods are despicable."

Xie Bangzhi demanded that the Bulgarian side apologize and guarantee the normal working conditions for the Xinhua correspondent, and immediately restore the Xinhua correspondent's right to cover the BCP's Ninth Congress on an equal footing with other journalists.

    保加利亚修正主义领导集团粗暴剥夺我国记者正常采访活动权利
    我驻保加利亚大使严重抗议保方的卑劣行为
    保方对中国记者的歧视是为苏修反华效劳、恶化两国关系的严重事件
    新华社索非亚十八日电　保加利亚修正主义领导集团为了追随苏联修正主义领导集团反华，最近竟对新华通讯社驻索非亚记者采取了一系列歧视行动，粗暴地剥夺了新华社记者采访保加利亚共产党第九次代表大会的权利。
    十一月十二日保方为保共“九大”举行记者招待会，但不请新华社记者参加。当天，新华社记者多次打电话给保加利亚外交部新闻司，询问关于采访保共“九大”的事宜，对方均推辞不答，一直拖到当晚七时，才通知我记者，可以到保共“九大”新闻中心领取“九大”开幕式入场证。
    十三日上午十时，在保共“九大”新闻中心，保加利亚外交部新闻司外国记者科科长丁科夫发给我记者采访保共“九大”开幕式的入场证。我记者当即质问他为什么不发给新华社记者采访保共“九大”会议的入场证和保共“九大”有关材料。丁科夫竟宣称：“中央指示，不发给中国记者”。我记者对这种歧视行为当场提出了抗议。
    当天晚上八时四十五分，有两名自称是“保共中央宣传部工作人员”的人到新华社索非亚分社办公处，对我记者说：“我们发给你的保共‘九大’开幕式入场证里边有错，需要改一下，否则明天入场有困难。”但当他们拿到我记者入场证后，却又改口说：“因为你们党没有派代表团参加我们党‘九大’，所以我们中央决定，将你的入场证收回。”他们说完拔腿就走。当时我记者对保方这种卑劣行为十分愤慨，不让他们溜掉，并打电话要保加利亚外交部马上派人来处理，但他们迟迟不派人来。经过三次电话催促，直到晚上十时，保方竟然派来了三名内务部人员。这些人声称是为“处理问题”而来的。他们虽然承认保共中央曾派过两个人来新华社索非亚分社，但所提供的姓名与那两个身份不明的人自报的姓名不符。为此，新华社记者不得不再次打电话催促保加利亚外交部派人到现场处理。但对方一拖再拖，经记者连续六次电话催促，迟至次日凌晨一时零五分才派代表到新华社分社。
    新华社记者向保加利亚外交部代表介绍了事情经过，并对保方用这种非法手段向新华社记者诈取保共“九大”开幕式入场证提出了抗议。保加利亚外交部代表、第五司司长培泰夫当面说：“这两个人是我们中央派来的，但他们在执行任务中有错误……”等等，并表示要把这两个人由他带回处理。
    但是使人不能容忍的是，保加利亚外交部代表仍然以中国共产党没有派代表团参加保共“九大”为借口，将官方正式发给新华社记者出席保共“九大”开幕式入场证强行收去。新华社记者对保方这种出尔反尔、严重歧视我记者的行为，表示极大的愤慨并再次提出了抗议。
    中国驻保加利亚大使谢邦治十六日下午就保方这种卑劣行为向保加利亚外交部长巴谢夫提出了严重的抗议。谢邦治大使指出：“你们出尔反尔，剥夺新华社记者进行正常采访活动权利的恶劣行为，是对中国记者的严重歧视，是为苏联修正主义者反华效劳、恶化两国关系的严重事件。你们的借口是荒谬的，手段是卑劣的。”
    谢邦治大使要求保方道歉，并保证新华社记者的正常工作条件，立即恢复新华社记者同其他记者一样采访保共“九大”的权利。
