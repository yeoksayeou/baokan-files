	Following in the Footsteps of Heroes
	Jiangxi Province Jian Second Middle School Red Guards  Guo Hongbing

	Comrade Cai Yongxiang sacrificed himself to rescue a train crossing the Qiantang River Bridge. I was one of the Red Guards on that train.

	On the morning of October 9, sixty Red Guards from our school boarded the special train for Red Guards from Nanchang to Beijing. Our hearts were already with Chairman Mao, and we felt the train was too slow, wishing we could fly to Beijing immediately.

	The next day, early in the morning, after the autumn rain, the night was dark. Around 2 a.m., the train arrived at the misty Qiantang River. Suddenly, the train made an emergency stop. I felt my body lurch forward, and then I heard the wheels screeching, "Screech, screech." The train stopped on the bridge... Shortly after, the train started moving again. The train attendant excitedly told us that on the Qiantang River Bridge, a soldier named Cai Yongxiang saw a large piece of wood lying across the tracks. To protect the safety of the young Red Guards and the bridge, in that critical moment, he fearlessly moved the wood, bravely sacrificing his precious life. We were all in tears, deeply saddened by Comrade Cai Yongxiang's sacrifice. Everyone excitedly said: "Comrade Cai Yongxiang saved our lives. We will never forget him. He is truly a good soldier of Chairman Mao." "Mao Zedong Thought has truly taken root in his mind. He is a hero like Ouyang Hai and Wang Jie. The PLA has produced so many heroes. We must learn from the PLA..."

	Comrade Cai Yongxiang died completely for the people's interests. His death is heavier than Mount Tai. The source of Comrade Cai Yongxiang's bravery is that he could seriously follow Chairman Mao's instructions. He set a shining example for us. I will learn from him with practical actions, love the Party and the people like he did, bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought, love it, believe in it, and worship it without limit. Whoever dares to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, I will smash them to pieces. I will dedicate everything to the Party and the people. Wherever the Party points, I will rush there. As long as it benefits the Party and the people, even if it means sacrificing, I am willing.

	We Red Guards will forever follow Chairman Mao's teachings, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow in the footsteps of revolutionary martyrs, and resolutely be the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    踏着英雄的足迹前进
    江西省吉安第二中学红卫兵  郭红兵
    蔡永祥同志舍身抢救了驰过钱塘江大桥的列车。我就是乘坐那次列车的红卫兵中的一个。
    十月九日上午，我校六十名红卫兵，登上从南昌开往北京的红卫兵专车。我们的心早已飞向毛主席的身边，总觉得列车太慢，巴不得马上就飞到北京。
    第二天凌晨，秋雨刚过，夜色昏黑。大约两点多钟，列车到达雾气蒙蒙的钱塘江畔。这时列车突然来了个紧急刹车，我只觉得身子猛向前倾了一下，又听到列车的轮子“刹刹”直叫，火车停在大桥上了……不久，车又开了，列车员同志激动地告诉我们，在钱塘江大桥上，一位名叫蔡永祥的解放军同志看见一根大木头横在铁轨上，他为了保卫红卫兵小将们的安全，为了保卫大桥，在那千钧一发的紧急关头，奋不顾身地搬去木头，英勇地献出了自己宝贵的生命。我们听了都热泪满眶，为蔡永祥同志的牺牲感到万分悲痛。大家都激动地说：“蔡永祥同志救了我们的生命，我们永远也不能忘记，他真是毛主席的好战士。”“毛泽东思想真正在他脑子里扎了根，他是欧阳海、王杰式的英雄。解放军里出现了那么多的英雄人物，我们一定要向解放军学习……。”
    蔡永祥同志完全是为人民的利益而死的，他的死比泰山还重。蔡永祥同志勇敢的源泉，是由于他能够认真按照毛主席的指示办事。他为我们树立了一个光辉的榜样。我要以实际行动向他学习，像他那样热爱党，热爱人民，像他那样勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想，对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。谁敢反对毛泽东思想，我就一定把谁砸得粉身碎骨。我要把一切都献给党和人民，党指向哪里，我就奔向哪里，只要对党对人民有益，哪怕牺牲，我也心甘情愿。
    我们红卫兵要永远遵照毛主席的教导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，踏着革命烈士的足迹，坚决做无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋！
