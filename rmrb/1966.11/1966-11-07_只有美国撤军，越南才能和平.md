New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcock denounces the Soviet revisionist clique for promoting the U.S. imperialist "peace talks" deception
Only the withdrawal of U.S. troops can bring peace to Vietnam
Strong condemnation from Asian and African public opinion against Johnson's Manila meeting to plot the expansion of the war

New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcock, in a statement, denounced the Soviet revisionist leadership for assisting U.S. imperialism in promoting the "peace talks" deception on the Vietnam issue.

The statement by Wilcock was published in the New Zealand Communist Party's organ, the weekly "People's Voice," on November 2. The statement pointed out that the leaders of modern revisionism have become friends of U.S. imperialism in advocating "peace" on the Vietnam issue. The statement said that they ignore the fact that only the victory of the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle can achieve peace.

The statement exposed the collusion of Soviet government officials and newspapers and magazines with U.S. imperialism in the "bombing halt and deception" plot. It emphasized that "the only way to achieve peace is through the people's victory over U.S. imperialism." Only the withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops can bring peace to Vietnam.

Wilcock strongly condemned the recent gathering of U.S. lackeys in Manila by the United States. He pointed out that the "peace" conditions proposed by this meeting are aimed at enabling U.S. imperialism to "continue to rule in South Vietnam and take action in Southeast Asia at any time." Wilcock said, "We must not be deceived by U.S. imperialism's call for 'peace.'"

The public opinion of Laos, Pakistan, and other countries continues to strongly condemn Johnson's Manila meeting for plotting to escalate the war of aggression in Vietnam.

Laos' "Pathet Lao Radio" recently issued a commentary stating that the war criminal Johnson's Manila meeting exposed the U.S. imperialist's plot to cobble together a new military alliance to suppress the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia.

The commentary said: The people of Laos will, together with the peoples of various Asian countries, resolutely smash any new military alliance cobbled together by the United States and thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism.

The commentary pointed out that world public opinion is firmly demanding that U.S. imperialism withdraw all U.S. troops and mercenary forces from South Vietnam.

The commentary also warned the U.S. lackeys: They will definitely not escape the punishment of the peoples of Asia if they stubbornly follow their American masters to betray their country and people.

A recent editorial in the Pakistani port city of Karachi's "Unity" newspaper pointed out that at the Manila meeting, Johnson spoke of "Asian peace" but thought of escalating the war.

Tanzania's Swahili-language newspaper "Thunder" published an editorial on November 4 condemning Johnson's recent Manila meeting to plot the intensification of the aggression against Vietnam. The editorial emphasized that the fighting people of Vietnam will win the final victory in the war against U.S. aggression.
