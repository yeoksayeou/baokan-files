Tibet's liberated farmers, who have seen a bumper harvest for the eighth consecutive year, are inspired by their success and are actively reforming their old farming tools. As a result, eighty percent of the farmland in the region is now using new plows for autumn plowing. This marks a significant change in Tibet's agricultural production.

In the past, Tibetan villages primarily used wooden plows for farming, which were slow and produced poor results. Since liberation, the Party and the government have supplied a large number of new plows each year. This year, the area using new plows for autumn plowing has increased by more than thirty percent compared to previous years. Consequently, the pace of autumn plowing has accelerated, and the quality of tillage has significantly improved.

    西藏广泛使用新式步犁
    连续获得第八年丰收的西藏翻身农民，在丰收的鼓舞下，积极改革旧式农具，使全区百分之八十的农田使用新式步犁秋耕，这是西藏农业生产上的一个大变化。
    过去，西藏农村大都用木犁耕田，犁得慢，质量差。解放后党和政府每年都供应大批新式步犁。今年使用新式步犁秋耕的面积，比往年扩大了百分之三十多。因而使秋耕进度加快。耕作质量也有显著提高。
