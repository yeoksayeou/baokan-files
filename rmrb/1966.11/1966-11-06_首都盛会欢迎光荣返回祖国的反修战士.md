Highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the struggle against revisionism through to the end!

The capital held a grand gathering to welcome the honorable anti-revisionist warriors returning to the motherland. The Soviet revisionist leadership's frenzied anti-China actions are nothing more than a few stinking flies buzzing around, causing no harm to us whatsoever, and cannot obstruct the rolling wheels of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution or the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought among the revolutionary peoples of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: 15,000 revolutionary masses and Red Guards from various sectors of the capital held a grand rally at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium this afternoon to express the warmest welcome to all Chinese students who were unjustly ordered to return by the Soviet government, and to strongly protest the despicable actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership in further worsening Sino-Soviet relations and undermining Sino-Soviet friendship. The meeting solemnly declared: To oppose imperialism, we must oppose revisionism. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the struggle against modern revisionism, with the Soviet Communist Party leadership as its center, through to the end!

Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Premier Chen Yi, member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group Mu Xin, Deputy Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua, Deputy Minister of Higher Education Duan Luofu, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Office Song Yiping, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Wu Youxun, and Vice Mayor of Beijing Wang Kunlun, as well as other relevant leaders, attended the meeting.

Many foreign friends in Beijing also attended the meeting.

At 3:30 PM, all Chinese students returning from the Soviet Union ascended the stage to thunderous applause. Red Guards from the capital, holding framed color portraits of Chairman Mao, rushed onto the stage to present the portraits to the honorable anti-revisionist warriors. At this moment, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly for a long time, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" without stopping.

After the welcome rally began, all 15,000 people in the audience sang "The East is Red" and recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "The people of the whole world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, our cause is just, the enemy is bound to be defeated, but it is not easy to achieve final victory. We must not forget class struggle! We must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance bravely along the road of socialism!"

Deputy Minister of Higher Education Duan Luofu was the first to speak at the meeting, expressing the warmest greetings to the victorious returning anti-revisionist warriors and the strongest protest against the Soviet government's new crimes of worsening Sino-Soviet relations. In his speech, he enthusiastically praised all the students studying in the Soviet Union for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely fighting against Soviet modern revisionism, and resolutely safeguarding the friendship between Chinese and Soviet students and between the two peoples. He said that in the face of difficulties and threats, they dared to fight and dared to win, showing the heroic spirit of Chinese youth nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.

Duan Luofu encouraged the returning students to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, care about state affairs, and actively participate in the current fierce class struggle, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Vice Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation Wei Zhanglin, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation, spoke at the meeting, extending a warm welcome to all Chinese students returning from the Soviet Union and strongly protesting the Soviet government's shameless anti-China actions. She said that the rapid spread and deep-rooted influence of the great Mao Zedong Thought around the world is an irresistible historical trend that no one can stop. The reckless actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership will only "lift a rock to drop on their own feet," and their plots will surely fail completely! She enthusiastically praised the Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union for their heroic and resolute struggle against Soviet revisionism, their firm stance, fearlessness in the face of difficulties, and their daring to fight and win, showing the revolutionary spirit of rebellion of the proletariat. She said that to oppose imperialism, we must oppose revisionism. We must hold higher the revolutionary banner of opposing American imperialism, opposing Soviet revisionism, and opposing reactionaries of all countries, and fight bravely to the end for the great cause of world revolution!

Representatives of the capital's universities and colleges Red Guards, representatives of the capital's middle schools Red Guards, and representatives of the "Long March Red Guards" from Dalian Maritime University, who walked to Beijing for revolutionary linkage, spoke at the meeting in succession. They expressed the warmest welcome and the most cordial greetings to the honorable anti-revisionist warriors, paying revolutionary respects to them in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and strongly protesting the Soviet government's unreasonable behavior. They said in their speeches:

"The Soviet revisionist leadership's unreasonable expulsion of all Chinese students is like a poisoned arrow in their hearts and cowardice in their bones. They are afraid of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of our country. Their slander, defamation, and attacks are nothing to us, who are armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They are like a few stinking flies buzzing around, causing no harm to us whatsoever, and cannot obstruct the rolling wheels of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution or the widespread dissemination of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought among the revolutionary peoples of the world!"

"The Soviet revisionists are in cahoots with American imperialism, committing crime after crime against the peoples of the world, and owing debt after debt. One day, this debt will be settled, and the peoples of the world will never forgive them. They will only hurt themselves by lifting a rock to drop on their own feet. Their reckless actions will only lead to their own downfall, and they will surely be crushed to pieces by the wheels of history."

"American imperialism dreams of China's 'peaceful evolution' and places this hope on our younger generation. The Soviet revisionist leadership also hopes that we will abandon the cause of the proletarian revolution and take the road of revisionism. We will give a loud shout: Your tricks will never succeed, and your dreams are doomed to fail. We are Red Guards and revolutionary youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Our hearts are filled with the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We are determined to train ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We will follow the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution, thoroughly smash the old world, and build a new world of brilliant Mao Zedong Thought!"

Following this, Chinese students returning from the Soviet Union, Hong Gang, Zhang Pengya, and Hu Debao, spoke in succession amidst thunderous applause. With extremely excited hearts, they expressed their heartfelt thanks to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the people of our motherland for their boundless concern. They said that they had returned from the Soviet Union, where the Soviet Communist Party revisionist leadership is in power, to our great motherland, to the side of Chairman Mao, and felt boundless warmth. They said that in the days since their return, they had seen the great motherland filled with a revolutionary atmosphere, and were greatly inspired. They expressed their determination to hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end with the revolutionary people, youth, and Red Guards of the whole country, and to carry the struggle against modern revisionism, with the Soviet Communist Party leadership as its center, through to the end!

In their speeches, they also listed facts, angrily exposing and denouncing the various restrictions, harassment, and persecution of Chinese students by the Soviet authorities, and exposing the numerous crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership in restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union. They used a large number of vivid facts to show that the despicable anti-China actions of the Soviet Communist Party leadership are extremely unpopular in the Soviet Union.

They happily said that the Soviet people have boundless love for the great leader of the revolutionary peoples of the world, Chairman Mao, boundless respect for the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and boundless deep affection for the Chinese people. They mentioned that some Soviet people had told them that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the Soviet people. The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will one day fly over the Kremlin in Moscow. They also pointed out that no matter how the Soviet revisionist leadership acts recklessly and commits crimes, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is something they cannot destroy, and the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought is something they cannot stop. The Soviet revisionist leadership's heinous crimes of destroying the cause of the proletarian revolution and the world revolution will surely be punished by history.

All the speeches at the meeting aroused wave after wave of long, enthusiastic applause. During the speeches, people repeatedly shouted with raised arms: "Strongest protest against the shameful anti-China actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Carry the struggle against modern revisionism, with the Soviet Communist Party leadership as its center, through to the end!" "Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

At the end of the welcome rally, the entire audience stood up and sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" in unison. All the returning students from the Soviet Union walked around the venue, greeting all the comrades attending the meeting. At this moment, people eagerly shook hands with the honorable anti-revisionist warriors, and some Red Guards handed them letters of greeting written on the spot, enthusiastically praising their firm stance and fearlessness in the face of violence, showing the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. Some Red Guards presented the most precious "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the students returning from the Soviet Union, hoping that their comrades would better read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The entire venue, with 15,000 people, continuously and rhythmically shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years!"

    欢迎大会开始后，全场一万五千人高唱《东方红》，齐声朗读毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    高等教育部副部长段洛夫首先在大会上讲话，向胜利归来的反修战士们表示最亲切的慰问，对苏联政府的恶化中苏关系的新罪行表示最强烈的抗议。他在讲话中热烈赞扬全体留苏学生高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决同苏联现代修正主义进行斗争，坚决维护中苏两国学生和两国人民的友谊，在困难和威胁面前敢于斗争，敢于胜利，表现了毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的中国青年的英雄气概。

    “苏联修正主义者同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，对世界人民犯下了一桩又一桩的罪行，欠下了一笔又一笔的账，这笔账总有一天要清算，世界人民是绝对不会饶恕他们的。他们搬起石头只能砸他们自己的脚，他们这样的胡作非为，只会自食其果，必将被历史的车轮砸个粉身碎骨。”

    他们在讲话中还列举事实，愤怒地揭露和控诉了苏联当局对我国留学生的种种限制、刁难和迫害，揭露了苏联修正主义领导集团在苏联复辟资本主义的大量罪行。他们以大量的生动事实说明，苏共领导集团卑劣的反华行径，在苏联是非常不得人心的。
    他们高兴地说，苏联人民对全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限崇敬，对中国人民充满了无限的深情厚谊。他们谈到，有的苏联人曾经对他们说，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是苏联人民的伟大领袖。毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，终有一天将飘扬在莫斯科克里姆林宫的上空。他们还指出，不管苏联修正主义领导集团怎样倒行逆施，胡作非为，中苏人民的友谊是他们破坏不了的，毛泽东思想的广泛传播是他们阻挡不了的。苏联修正主义领导集团破坏无产阶级和世界人民革命事业的滔天罪行，必将受到历史的惩罚。
