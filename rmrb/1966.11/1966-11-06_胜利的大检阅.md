	A Great Victory Parade
	Chairman Mao's sixth inspection of the Cultural Revolution army is a great victory parade, a grand celebration of the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Amidst the triumphant songs of victory, we look back on the situation of our Cultural Revolution over the past few months. Our hearts are stirred, and we have so much to say to our beloved leader, Chairman Mao!

	Revolution has always been the business of the broad masses of the people, not something that a few individuals can monopolize. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is even more so. However, on the issue of how to treat the masses, a struggle between two diametrically opposed lines has emerged. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao fully trusts the masses, relies on the masses, respects the masses' initiative, and lets the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves. The bourgeois reactionary line, on the other hand, does not trust the masses, regards the masses as fools, sees itself as a savior, and even suppresses and attacks revolutionary masses.

	A thunderclap! The Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was announced! This is the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! This is Chairman Mao standing up for us, speaking for us, and encouraging us! We were overjoyed and ecstatic! We used willow branches as flagpoles and red paper as flags, and marched in the rain on the campus. The rain soaked our clothes and red flags, and the red flags dyed our clothes red. We kept shouting and moving forward. We felt that Chairman Mao was by our side, and we were full of strength! August 8, what an unforgettable night! How many people were so excited that they couldn't sleep all night!

	"Since the Cultural Revolution is a revolution, it is inevitable that there will be resistance." The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee proclaimed the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line. However, the poison of this reactionary line has not been completely eliminated. We clearly realized that without thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, it would be impossible to carry out genuine struggle, criticism, and transformation, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution would be in danger of failure! We overcame various difficulties and pressures and persisted in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line.

	In the struggle, the beacon that guided us was Mao Zedong Thought. At the most intense and difficult times, we held the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in our hands and thought of Chairman Mao's teachings in our hearts. "Dare to sacrifice oneself and dare to pull the emperor off his horse," "Be determined, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." This is the source of our strength! "In times of difficulty, our comrades should see achievements, see light, and boost our courage." "When the twilight is gloomy, look at the sturdy pine; even when the clouds are chaotic, remain composed." "No matter how the wind blows or the waves beat, it is like a leisurely stroll in the courtyard." These sayings greatly boosted our fighting spirit! It is the great thought of our great leader that inspired and encouraged us to overcome the difficult struggle.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The problems of China are complex, and our minds should be a bit more complex as well." Mao Zedong Thought is the truth, and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao will inevitably achieve thorough victory. However, the evil influence of the bourgeois reactionary line has not yet been eliminated. Revolutionary comrades must remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "pursuing the fleeing enemy with remaining courage" and deeply criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. We have made up our minds to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and swear to carry the struggle between the two lines to the end, ensuring the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 胜利的大检阅

    胜利的大检阅
    毛主席第六次检阅文化革命大军，这是一次胜利的大检阅，是一次欢呼毛主席的革命路线取得伟大胜利的大检阅。在这胜利的凯歌声中，回顾几个月来我院文化大革命的情况，我们心情激荡，有多少心里话要向我们敬爱的领袖毛主席倾吐呀！
    革命，从来就是广大人民群众自己的事情，决不是少数人所能包办的。无产阶级文化大革命更是如此。但是，就在对待群众的问题上，出现了两条截然相反的路线的斗争。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，充分相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。资产阶级反动路线，却是不相信群众，把群众看成阿斗，把自己看成救世主，甚至压制群众，打击革命群众。
    一声春雷，党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定公布了！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利！这是毛主席在为我们撑腰，是毛主席在为我们说话，是毛主席在给我们鼓劲！我们顿时心花怒放，欢喜若狂！我们用柳条当旗杆，用红纸做旗子，在校园里冒雨游行。雨水淋湿我们的衣服和红旗，红旗染红我们的衣服，我们不停地欢呼着前进。我们感到毛主席就在我们身旁，我们浑身充满了力量！八月八日，多么难忘的夜晚啊，有多少人激动得彻夜未眠！
    “文化革命既然是革命，就不可避免地会有阻力。”党的八届十一中全会宣告了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产，可是这条反动路线的流毒并没有一下子消除。我们清楚地意识到，不彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，就不可能进行真正的斗批改，无产阶级文化大革命就有夭折的危险！我们又战胜种种非难和压制，坚持了批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争。
    斗争中，指引我们的灯塔是毛泽东思想。在斗争最激烈、最困难的时候，我们手里捧的是《毛主席语录》，心里想的是毛主席的教导。“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这是我们力量的源泉！“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”“暮色苍茫看劲松，乱云飞渡仍从容。”“不管风吹浪打，胜似闲庭信步”，这些名言则大大鼓舞了我们斗争的勇气！正是我们伟大领袖的伟大思想，鼓舞和激励着我们度过了艰苦斗争的时期。
    毛主席教导我们：“中国的问题是复杂的，我们的脑子也要复杂一点。”毛泽东思想是真理，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线必然会获得彻底胜利。但是，目前资产阶级反动路线的恶劣影响还没有肃清，革命同志必须记住毛主席“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的教导，深入开展对资产阶级反动路线的批判。我们已经下定决心，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓把两条路线的斗争进行到底，保证无产阶级文化革命的伟大胜利！
