The Shanghai Chinese Record Factory has produced and published a large number of records promoting Mao Zedong Thought.

		Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 28th — Chairman Mao's three brilliant works, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," have been produced as reading records by the Shanghai Chinese Record Factory. On the 25th, all revolutionary workers of the Chinese Record Factory held a grand meeting to celebrate the formal production of the reading records of the "Three Articles," marking a new achievement in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

		Previously, record production was controlled by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, who produced a large number of bad records that promoted decadent bourgeois and feudal ideas. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the Chinese Record Factory have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, raised their class consciousness, and exposed and overthrown the capitalist-roaders within the Party, sweeping away all monsters and demons. Through struggle, all revolutionary workers in the factory have deeply realized that records should not be cultural entertainment products but political propaganda tools. They must use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy this position. Starting from October, they have produced and published a large number of records promoting Mao Zedong Thought, including records with music for Chairman Mao's quotations, live recordings of Chairman Mao's three receptions of revolutionary teachers and students, and recordings of Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai's speeches at the reception of revolutionary teachers and students from all over the country.

		Last month, when the workers learned that they would produce reading records for Chairman Mao's works, everyone was overjoyed, considering it a great joy for the people of the entire country. They prepared meticulously. They resolved to produce the records with the fastest speed, the best quality, the lowest cost, and the highest output to meet the needs of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as revolutionary teachers and students. When the tape of the reading of Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" was brought from Beijing to the factory, workers from all departments immediately sprang into action, working day and night, completing in two days what usually took more than a week. By noon on the 25th, they had produced the first batch of fine and coarse reading records. After testing, the sound quality was excellent.

		At the celebration meeting held that day, workers from all departments expressed their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works earnestly, to be like the heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team, to imprint Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, melt it into their blood, and put it into action. They vowed to turn the record factory into a red factory for promoting Mao Zedong Thought, to produce a large number of records promoting Mao Zedong Thought, and to let the voice of Mao Zedong Thought resound across the country and the world.

    让毛泽东思想的声音响遍全国全世界
    上海中国唱片厂制作出版了大量宣传毛泽东思想的唱片
    新华社上海二十八日电　毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇光辉著作，已由上海中国唱片厂制成朗读唱片。二十五日，中国唱片厂全体革命职工，为“老三篇”朗读唱片正式投入生产举行了隆重集会，热烈庆祝无产阶级文化大革命中的这一新成果。
    过去，唱片生产为一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派把持，生产了大量宣扬腐朽的资产阶级和封建主义思想的坏唱片。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，中国唱片厂广大革命群众，活学活用毛主席著作，提高了阶级觉悟，擦亮了眼睛，斗倒了党内走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。通过斗争锻炼，全厂革命职工深刻地认识到，唱片不应该是文化娱乐品，而应该是政治宣传品，一定要用毛泽东思想去占领这个阵地。从十月份开始，他们制作出版了大量宣传毛泽东思想的唱片，其中有为毛主席语录谱曲的唱片，毛主席三次接见革命师生的实况录音片，以及林彪同志和周恩来同志在接见全国各地来京革命师生大会上的讲话录音片等。
    上个月，当职工知道要为毛主席著作制作朗读唱片时，个个欢欣鼓舞，认为这是全国人民的一件大喜事，并认真地做好准备工作。他们下定决心，要用最快的速度，最好的质量，最低的成本，最高的产量，把它生产出来，以满足广大工农兵群众和革命师生的需要。当毛主席著作“老三篇”的朗读录音胶带，由北京带到厂里，各个部门的职工立即行动起来，夜以继日连续作战，只花了两天的时间，做完了过去需要一个多星期的工作，在二十五日中午生产出第一批密纹和粗纹两种朗读唱片。经过试听，音质很好。
    在当天举行的庆祝大会上，各个部门的职工都纷纷表示：要努力活学活用毛主席著作，像32111钻井队的英雄们那样，把毛泽东思想印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，把唱片厂办成宣传毛泽东思想的红色工厂，大量出版宣传毛泽东思想的唱片，让毛泽东思想的声音响遍全国，响遍全世界。
