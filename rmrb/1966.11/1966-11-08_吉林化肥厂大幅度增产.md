The revolutionary workers of the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have smashed the foreign frameworks and the authority of the bourgeoisie, leading to a significant increase in fertilizer production. Since this year, the average monthly production of ammonia and ammonium nitrate in the entire plant has increased by more than twenty percent compared to the same period last year. The coal and coke consumption per ton of ammonia has also been significantly reduced, saving the country a large amount of coal and coke.

    吉林化肥厂大幅度增产
    吉林化肥厂广大革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，大破洋框框，大破资产阶级“权威”，促使化肥产量大幅度增加。今年以来，全厂合成氨和硝酸铵的平均月产量都比去年同期增长了百分之二十以上。每吨合成氨消耗的煤炭和焦炭都显著降低，为国家节约了大量煤炭和焦炭。
