The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam continues to publish a black book exposing the war crimes of American chemical warfare. The Vietnamese people have an unyielding hatred for the inhuman American aggressors.

Editor's Note: The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's black book, which exposes the war crimes of American imperialism in Vietnam, has been published in its second volume. This further proves that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the people of the world.

American imperialism is a mad beast in its death throes, attempting to use inhuman methods to salvage its failing war in Vietnam. However, the outcome of a war is determined by people, not weapons. The heinous crimes of American imperialism only deepen the Vietnamese people's hatred for American imperialism, making them more resolute and powerful in striking back at the American aggressors. The victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in their anti-American war fully demonstrate this.

Chairman Mao has pointed out, "No matter what kind of inhuman weapons the American imperialists use, ... the American imperialists will inevitably be driven out of South Vietnam." The failure of American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is inevitable. Its doom is also inevitable. The more evil deeds it commits, the sooner it will be buried.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on November 23, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported: The "Committee to Accuse the War Crimes of American Imperialism and Its Puppets in South Vietnam" of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently published the second volume of the black book titled "It Is More Brutal Than Hitler."

(The first volume, "The Greatest War Criminal of the Contemporary World," was published in July of this year.) This further exposes the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in its use of chemical warfare in South Vietnam.

The black book states that, despite the opposition of the people of the world, American imperialism has already and is increasingly using chemical warfare tools on a large scale in its aggression against Vietnam. The lives and property of countless people in South Vietnam have been savagely destroyed! Its heinous crimes must be exposed before progressive humanity.

The black book states that American imperialism, in order to force the people of South Vietnam to submit, has openly used chemical poisons, war gases, napalm bombs, and phosphorus bombs to kill people.

On December 1, 1958, American imperialism and the puppet government of Ngo Dinh Diem simultaneously used chemical poisons to poison 6,000 patriots imprisoned in the Phu Quoc Prison in the province of Phu Quoc, many of whom were women.

The Phu Quoc incident was condemned by all humanity. However, American imperialism and its puppets continued to use poisons in many other places in South Vietnam.

The black book states that since the end of 1961, American imperialism has also used chemical poisons to destroy crops, create a terror atmosphere, and cause famine, attempting to force the people of the South to move to so-called "strategic hamlets" to live.

To accelerate the implementation of the policy of concentrating people to build "strategic hamlets," from 1962 to 1964, they expanded the scope of chemical poison spraying every year in the Central South and South regions. The area of destroyed fields, gardens, and trees, the number of poisoned people, and the number of poisoned livestock all increased exponentially each year.

According to incomplete statistics from the medical department of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, in 1965, the number of provinces affected by chemical poison spraying increased to 26 (one-third of all provinces in South Vietnam), the area destroyed reached 700,000 hectares, the number of poisoned people reached 146,274, which is 13 times that of 1964 and 80 times that of 1961.

American planes often dropped gas bombs while spraying chemical poisons or dropped destructive bombs and napalm bombs after spraying chemical poisons, with the aim of maximizing slaughter and destruction.

In recent months, it has been spraying chemical poisons in the Central South, Western Highlands, and Southern regions. In September of this year, it also brazenly sprayed chemical poisons in the southern part of the demilitarized zone and in the minority areas of the northern part of the demilitarized zone.

The black book points out that when the American aggressors used various gases to kill people, in 1963 and 1964, the American aggressors repeatedly used gas bombs and gas bombs to shell and bomb the villages of some counties in the provinces of Binh Dinh, Quang Ngai, Kien Giang, Quang Nam, Phu Yen, and Quang Ngai.

Since the end of 1964, in order to salvage the continuous defeats of the puppet army it commanded and to deal with the increasingly intense anti-American struggle in various cities in the South, the American aggressors, while strengthening the spraying of chemical poisons, also strengthened the use of various gases, and the scale became larger and larger.

In early 1965, on January 25, 26, and 27, American planes consecutively dropped destructive bombs, napalm bombs, and a large number of gas bombs on Phu Loc village in Phu Yen province, causing serious losses to the people. Just the gas bombs alone caused 80 deaths and hundreds of serious injuries, most of whom were elderly, women, and children.

On September 5, 1965, a U.S. Marine Corps unit, while "sweeping" through the village of Vinh Long in the district of Suoi Trau, province of Binh Dinh, sprayed 48 canisters of poison gas into the people's houses and hiding holes, killing 35 people on the spot and seriously poisoning 19.

Three days after the Vinh Long incident, the U.S. military again threw poison gas grenades into the people's hiding holes in Ba Lang An, province of Quang Ngai, on September 8, poisoning 78 innocent people to death.

In the "sweep" launched in the area of Bau Thang, province of Kien Giang, on January 2, 1966, the American bandits used poison gas bombs and chemical poisons fired by light weapons.

On January 10, 1966, the American bandits, while "sweeping" through the village of Kim Chien in the province of Binh Dinh, committed a large-scale and extremely brutal massacre. They herded 42 villagers into a cave and then poisoned them to death with gas. In January 1966, more than 10,000 U.S., Australian, New Zealand, and puppet troops launched a "sweep" in the villages of Nhon Duc, Duc Hiep, and Phu My Hiep in the district of Go Vap, province of Gia Dinh. They sprayed poison gas into the people's hiding holes, killing more than 100 people and seriously poisoning hundreds.

On February 1, 1966, the American bandits sprayed poison gas into 141 people's hiding holes in the village of Ky Nghia, district of Tam Ky, province of Quang Nam, killing many people. On February 3 and 4, 1966, U.S. helicopters dropped 800 gas bombs in the area of Phu My, province of Binh Dinh. By March 1966, they had exploded 3,000 gas bombs in this area, killing and injuring many people.

From April 23 to May 9, 1966, U.S. planes also dumped 15 tons of volatile poisons in some areas of the province of An Xuyen, killing and poisoning many people, and causing the death of a large number of livestock and poultry. The poisons fell into the rivers of Ong Doc and Lo Go, poisoning more than 300 kilograms of fish.

Even within the city of Saigon, the American aggressors and their puppets used poison gas to suppress the people's demonstrations at the end of May this year.

The black book states that from the end of 1961 to the present, the American aggressors and their puppets have dropped napalm bombs on more than 1,000 villages in South Vietnam.

The black book further exposes the heinous crimes of American imperialism in blatantly violating international law and using war gases against the people of South Vietnam. Since the end of 1964, especially since the 1965-1966 dry season, the U.S. military, mercenary troops, and puppet troops have used many kinds of war gases. American officials have been forced to admit that they have used various gases such as CN, CS, and DM in South Vietnam. In addition, the United States also uses various lethal mixed gases and other suffocating gases.

The black book emphasizes that although American imperialism is using chemical poisons and other chemical warfare tools on a large scale, it cannot cause famine in South Vietnam or "reverse the situation." The people of South Vietnam have a strong will to fight, carry on the tradition of resisting natural disasters and enemy invasions, and if the rice fields are destroyed, they immediately replant or plant other crops instead of rice, or increase the area of double cropping, and raise livestock and poultry again and replant fruit trees. The medical department of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the local Red Cross personnel work day and night to go to various places to personally treat the poisoned, and to popularize anti-poison and anti-poison experience for the people of South Vietnam.

The black book states that American imperialism has been and is strengthening the production of various chemical weapons and biological weapons, and is storing a large number of these weapons in many places in the United States. The U.S. budget for research on chemical and biological warfare has increased from $3.63 million in 1959 to $170 million in 1964.

Because American imperialism has tarnished the reputation of American and world science, American and world scientists have strongly protested against it.

People of the world, governments of various countries, and various international organizations and international conferences all strongly condemn it. In the United States, the opposition of the American people is also becoming more and more intense.

The black book points out that the prohibition of the use of various chemical poisons and gases as weapons of war has become an international custom. The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 also recognize this prohibition.

According to international law, the use of various chemical warfare tools by the American aggressors in South Vietnam is a war crime and a crime against humanity.

The purpose of American imperialism in using chemical weapons as a tool of war is to trample on the sacred national rights of the Vietnamese people. Its crimes are becoming more and more numerous, more and more serious, and unforgivable.

The crimes of American imperialism against the Vietnamese people are as high as mountains. It is more brutal, despicable, and brazen than Hitler's fascism. Hitler only secretly used chemical poisons in concentration camps, but American imperialism today is brazenly using them, and the scale is getting bigger and bigger. Its crimes are international crimes, a brutal provocation to humanity.

The black book concludes by saying that now, American imperialism is not willing to give up its plot to invade Vietnam, but instead is accelerating preparations for a new "escalation" of the war. As revealed by U.S. newspapers many times, it will increase the use of poisons, gases, and other chemical warfare tools in South Vietnam many times over.

The Vietnamese people, united as one, deeply harbor an unyielding hatred for the American aggressors. Millions of people around the world, including the American people, who love peace, freedom, and justice, are all outraged by the savage crimes of the United States.

The Vietnamese people, with deep hatred, are determined to fight to thoroughly frustrate all the evil plots of American imperialism. The Vietnamese people are confident that every person in the world with a conscience will stand up and join the Vietnamese people to actively fight to severely condemn the American imperialist aggressors and stop their evil claws.

    南越民族解放阵线继续发表黑皮书揭露美帝进行化学战争的罪行
    越南人民同灭绝人性的美国侵略者不共戴天
    编者按：越南南方民族解放阵线揭露美帝国主义侵略越南的战争罪行的黑皮书第二卷，再一次证明了美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
    美帝国主义是一只垂死挣扎的疯狂的野兽，它妄想用灭绝人性的手段来挽救它在侵越战争中的败局。但是，决定战争胜负的是人，不是武器。美帝国主义的滔天罪行，只能激起越南人民对美帝国主义的更深刻的仇恨，从而更坚决、更有力地打击美国侵略者。越南南方人民在反美战争中取得的一个又一个的胜利，充分说明了这一点。
    毛主席曾经指出，“不论美帝国主义使用什么样的灭绝人性的武器，……美帝国主义终将从越南南方滚出去。”美帝国主义侵略越南的失败是注定了的。它的灭亡也是注定了的。它干的坏事越多，它被埋葬的日子就一定来得越快。
    据新华社河内二十三日电　越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线“控诉美帝国主义及其走狗在越南南方的战争罪行委员会”最近发表了题为《它比希特勒还要残暴》的黑皮书第二卷
  （黑皮书第一卷《当代最大的战争罪犯》已在今年七月间发表），进一步揭露了美帝国主义在越南南方进行化学战争所犯下的滔天罪行。
    黑皮书说，美帝国主义不顾世界人民的反对，在侵越战争中，已经和正在日益大规模地对越南南方使用化学战争工具。无数越南南方人民的生命和财产遭到极端野蛮的摧残！它的滔天罪行必须在进步人类面前予以揭露。
    黑皮书说，美帝国主义为了迫使越南南方人民屈服，公然使用了化学毒药，战争毒气，凝固汽油弹，磷质弹等杀害人民。
    一九五八年十二月一日，美帝国主义和吴庭艳走狗政权在同一时间里，就用化学毒物毒害被监禁在土龙木省富利监狱里的六千名爱国者，其中有许多是妇女。
    富利惨案遭到了全人类的谴责。然而，美帝国主义及其走狗仍然继续在越南南方的其他许多地方使用毒药。
    黑皮书说，美帝国主义从一九六一年年底起，还使用化学毒药破坏庄稼，制造恐怖气氛和饥饿现象，妄图迫使南方人民迁到以“战略村”为名的集中营里生活。
    为了加紧推行集中人民建立“战略村”的政策，从一九六二年到一九六四年，它们每年都在中部南区和南部加强和扩大撒放化学毒药的范围。被破坏的田地、园圃和树木的面积、中毒的人数和毒死的家畜，每年都成倍地增加。
    据越南南方民族解放阵线医务部门的不完全统计，在一九六五年，被撒放化学毒药的省份增加到二十六个（占越南南方全部省份的五分之三），被破坏的面积达七十万公顷，中毒人数达十四万六千二百七十四人，相当于一九六四年的十三倍，一九六一年的八十倍。
    美国飞机经常在撒放化学毒药的同时，还投下毒气囊，或者在撒放化学毒药之后，还投下破坏性炸弹和凝固汽油弹，其目的是为了最大限度地进行屠杀和摧毁。
    近几个月来，它疯狂地在中部南区、西原区和南部地区撒放化学毒药。今年九月间，它还明目张胆地在非军事区南部地区和非军事区北部的少数民族地区撒放化学毒药。
    黑皮书在揭露美国侵略者用各种毒气杀害人民时指出，在一九六三和一九六四年间，美国侵略者曾经多次用毒气炮弹和毒气炸弹炮击和轰炸槟椥、鹅贡、芹苴、金瓯、富安和广南等省的一些乡。
    从一九六四年底起，为了挽救由它指挥的伪军的连续失败和对付南方各城市日益高涨的反美斗争，美国侵略者在加强撒放化学毒药的同时，还加强使用各种毒气，而且规模越来越大。
    一九六五年初，在一月二十五日、二十六日和二十七日三天里，美国飞机接连地向富安省的富乐村投下破坏性炸弹、凝固汽油弹和大量的毒气炸弹，给人民造成严重损失。仅仅是毒气炸弹，就使八十人死亡和几百人重伤，其中大部分是老人、妇女和儿童。
    一九六五年九月五日，一支美国海军陆战队在向平定省绥福县荣光村进行“扫荡”的时候，曾经向人民的房屋和隐蔽洞喷射了四十八筒毒气，使三十五人当场死亡和十九人严重中毒。
    荣光村事件发生后三天，美国军队又在九月八日向广义省巴浪安角人民的掩蔽洞投掷毒气手榴弹，一下子毒死七十八名无辜人民。
    今年一月二日在堤岸省保寨地区发动的“扫荡”中，美国强盗使用了用轻武器发射的毒气弹和化学毒药。
    今年一月十日，美国强盗在向平定省金才村进行“扫荡”的时候，曾经犯下了大规模屠杀的极其野蛮的罪行。它们把四十二个村民赶进地洞，然后用毒气把他们毒死。一九六六年一月，一万多名美军、澳大利亚军、新西兰军和伪军向嘉定省古芝县润德、德协和富美兴等乡发动“扫荡”。它们向人民的隐蔽洞喷射毒气，使一百多人死亡和数以百计的人严重中毒。
    今年二月一日，美国强盗在广南省三岐县岐英乡向人民的一百四十一个隐蔽洞喷射毒气，使许多人死亡。一九六六年二月三日和四日，美国直升飞机向平定省蓬山地区投下八百颗毒气弹，到一九六六年三月，它们又在这个地区爆炸了三千颗毒气弹，使许多人死亡和受伤。
    从一九六六年四月二十三日到五月九日，美国飞机也向西宁省一些地区倾泻了十五吨挥发性毒药，使许多人死亡和中毒，家畜和家禽大量死亡。毒药落在鹅盖河和罗鹅河上，毒死了三百多公斤鱼。
    就是在西贡市内，美国侵略者及其走狗也使用毒气来镇压今年五月底的人民示威斗争。
    黑皮书说，仅从一九六一年底到现在，美国侵略者及其走狗就向越南南方的一千多个村庄扔下凝固汽油弹。
    黑皮书接着揭露美帝国主义悍然破坏国际公法，对南越人民使用战争毒气的滔天罪行。从一九六四年底以来，尤其是从一九六五年——一九六六年旱季以来，美军、帮凶军和伪军曾使用了许多种战争毒气。美国官方人士曾被迫承认说，它们在越南南方曾用过CN、CS和DM等各种毒气。此外，美国还使用各种杀人的混合气体，和其他一些窒息性气体。
    黑皮书强调指出，虽然美帝国主义这样大规模地撒放化学毒药和使用其他各种化学战争工具，但是，它不能使越南南方人民造成饥饿，也不能“扭转局势”。越南南方人民有着坚强的斗争意志，发扬抗御天灾敌祸的传统，稻子被毁坏了，就立刻重新种上，或者种植作物代替稻子，或者增加复种面积，重新饲养家畜、家禽和重新种植果树。越南南方民族解放阵线卫生部门和地区的解放红十字分会的人员夜以继日地来到各地，亲自治疗中毒的人，为越南南方人民普及防毒和抗毒经验。
    黑皮书说，美帝国主义已经和正在加强各种化学武器和细菌武器的生产，并在美国的许多地方，大量地储存着这些武器。美国在研究化学和细菌战争方面的经济预算，从一九五九年的三千六百三十万美元，增加到一九六四年的一亿七千万美元。
    由于美帝国主义污辱了美国和全人类科学的声誉，所以美国和世界的科学家们向它提出了强烈的抗议。
    世界人民、各国政府以及各个国际组织和国际会议都一致强烈谴责它们。在美国本土，美国人民的反对也越来越激烈。
    黑皮书指出，禁止把各种化学毒药和毒气用作战争工具，已经成了国际惯例。一八九九年和一九○七年的海牙公约也都公认这条禁例。
    根据国际法，美国侵略者在越南南方使用各种化学战争工具，是战争罪行，也是反对人类的罪行。
    美帝国主义用化学武器作为战争工具的目的，是践踏越南人民神圣的民族权利。它的罪行越来越多，越来越严重和不可宽恕。
    美帝国主义对越南人民犯下的罪行比山还高。它比希特勒法西斯还要残暴、卑鄙和明目张胆。希特勒只是偷偷摸摸地在集中营里使用化学毒药，美帝国主义今天却明目张胆地使用，而且规模越来越大。它的罪行是国际性的罪行，是对人类的横蛮挑衅。
   黑皮书最后说，现在，美帝国主义还不肯放弃它侵略越南的阴谋，相反，它正在加紧为新的战争“升级”作准备。正如美国报纸多次透露的那样，它在越南南方使用毒药、毒气和其他各种化学战争工具将会成倍地增加。
    越南人民万众一心，深深地记下了对美国侵略者的不共戴天之仇。世界上包括美国人民在内的千百万的爱好和平、自由和主持正义的人民，都对美国的野蛮罪行表示愤怒。
    越南人民怀着刻骨仇恨，为彻底挫败美帝国主义的一切罪恶阴谋而坚决斗争。越南人民坚信，世界上每一个有良知的人，都必将站起来同越南人民一道，为严厉谴责美帝国主义侵略者和制止其罪恶魔爪而进行积极的斗争。
