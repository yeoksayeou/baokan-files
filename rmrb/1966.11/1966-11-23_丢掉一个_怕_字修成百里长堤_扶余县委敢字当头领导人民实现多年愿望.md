The people of Fuyu County, Jilin Province, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, built a hundred-li long dike this year, ensuring a bumper harvest for vast tracts of farmland.

Fuyu County is surrounded by rivers on three sides. In the northern part of the county, there is a vast plain with fertile soil. However, every year during the flood season, the fields are submerged by the river water. The local people have long been eager to build a large dike to hold back the river water.

In recent years, the leading cadres of the Fuyu County Committee of the Communist Party of China have been planning to build the dike, but they were held back by the word "fear." The dike to be built requires excavating 26 million cubic meters of earth, crossing water surfaces at nine points, and moving ten hills. Moreover, the dike construction must be completed in one go before the flood season arrives; otherwise, a single flood could undo all the work. Therefore, for several years, the county committee leaders were afraid to take the risk and could not make a decision. Later, the county committee leaders, with this problem in mind, studied Chairman Mao's works earnestly, established the spirit of "daring to do," and decided to lead the people of the entire county to build this dike.

This spring, more than 15,000 workers entered the construction site. The county committee immediately organized the leadership to study Chairman Mao's works with the workers. In the dormitories, along the roads, and on the walls, Chairman Mao's quotations were hung everywhere. The workers seized every opportunity to study Chairman Mao's works, and the entire construction site became a large school of Mao Zedong Thought. "Building the dike for the revolution" became the shared voice of more than 10,000 workers.

Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength. Once the people have read Chairman Mao's books and grasped Mao Zedong Thought, they dare to think and dare to act, and they can overcome all difficulties.

The project, originally planned to be completed in two seasons, spring and autumn, was finished in three months by the workers' efforts. During this year's flood season, outside the hundred-li long dike was a vast expanse of water, but inside the dike, more than 100,000 mu of crops grew well and were unaffected, resulting in a bumper harvest. The early completion of this dike project educated the Fuyu County Committee and the broad masses of the people, making them deeply realize that as long as they grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can promote everything, transform everything, and overcome everything.

    丢掉一个“怕”字修成百里长堤
    ——扶余县委敢字当头领导人民实现多年愿望
    吉林省扶余县人民，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，今年修建了一条百里大堤，保证了大片农田获得丰收。
    扶余县三面环江，县境北部有一大片平原，土质肥沃，但每年汛期一到就被江水淹没。当地群众迫切要求修一条大堤，挡住江水。
    最近几年来，中共扶余县委的领导干部虽然一直在酝酿要修堤，但却被“怕”字束缚了手脚。要修的大堤，需挖二百六十多万方土，在九个地方横越水面，还要搬走十个山包。同时修堤工程必须一鼓作气在汛期到来之前完成，否则，一场大水便会前功尽弃。因此，几年来县委领导干部总是怕担风险，下不了决心。以后县委领导干部带着这个问题，认真学习了毛主席著作，树立了“敢”字当头的思想，决心领导全县人民把这条大堤修起来。
    今春，一万五千多名民工开进工地，县委立即组织领导民工们大学毛主席著作。在工棚里、道路旁、墙壁上，到处都挂有毛主席语录。民工们抓紧一切时间，学习毛主席著作，整个工地，成了一所毛泽东思想的大学校。“为革命筑堤”成了一万多民工共同的声音。
    毛泽东思想是力量的源泉。人民群众一旦读了毛主席的书，掌握了毛泽东思想，就敢想敢干，就能战胜一切困难。
    原计划分春秋两季完成的工程，在民工们的努力下，三个月就完成了。今年江水汛期，百里大堤外边一片汪洋，堤内十多万亩庄稼却安然无恙，长得很好，秋季获得了丰收。这个堤防工程的提前竣工，教育了扶余县委，也教育了广大人民，使他们深深体会到，只要掌握了毛泽东思想，就能推动一切，改造一切，战胜一切。
