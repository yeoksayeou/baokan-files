	Washington, November 29 (New China News Agency) — The U.S. State Department announced on November 28 that the United States has decided to upgrade its diplomatic relations with Bulgaria and Hungary from the level of chargé d'affaires to the level of ambassador, and this will be implemented immediately.

	State Department spokesman McCloskey said that this decision was made by U.S. President Johnson in accordance with his stated desire to "improve" U.S. relations with Eastern European countries.

	In a speech delivered in New York on October 7, Johnson revealed the U.S.'s grand conspiracy to collude with the Soviet Union in promoting counter-revolutionary strategies worldwide. He lavishly praised the "changing winds" rising in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, advocating that U.S. imperialism and "all Europeans" have "common ties beyond political differences," "a common civilization," and "common interests."

	McCloskey said that the United States believes that "it is obviously in our interest to have representatives at this (ambassadorial) level to effectively and appropriately handle our relations with (Hungary and Bulgaria) those countries."

	He added, "We hope that our (relations with these two countries) will be improved as a result of this step."

    约翰逊赞赏匈保演变之风
    决定把公使馆升为大使馆
    新华社二十九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院二十八日宣布，美国决定将它同保加利亚和匈牙利的外交关系从公使级提升到大使级，并且立即实行。
    国务院发言人麦克洛斯基说，这个决定是美国总统约翰逊根据他宣布的“改善”美国同东欧国家关系的愿望而采取的。
    约翰逊十月七日在纽约发表的一篇演说里，和盘托出了美国勾结苏联在全世界推行反革命策略的大阴谋，他大肆赞扬在苏联和东欧国家正在兴起的“改变之风”，鼓吹美帝国主义和“所有的欧洲人”之间有着“超越政治分歧的共同联系”、“共同的文明”、“共同的利益”。
    麦克洛斯基说，美国相信，“由（大使）这一级的代表来有效地和适当地处理我们同
  （匈、保）那些国家的关系，显然是符合我们的利益的”。
    他还说，“我们希望我们（与这两个国家）的全面关系将由于这一步骤而有所改善”。
