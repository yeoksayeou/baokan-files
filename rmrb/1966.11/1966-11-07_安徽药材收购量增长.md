The medicinal herb departments in Anhui Province have prioritized political work and focused on promoting the production of traditional Chinese medicines, ensuring effective procurement and supply. This year, the procurement volume of many major traditional Chinese medicines in Anhui Province has significantly increased compared to the same period last year. For example, the procurement volume of white peony has exceeded last year's annual procurement by 40%, and the procurement of poria has increased by 30%. Currently, the annual procurement tasks for various traditional Chinese medicines have been completed by more than 75%.

Additionally, some commonly used medicines that previously had to be sourced from other provinces, such as coptis, ophiopogon, yam, and magnolia bark, have also been procured.

    安徽药材收购量增长
    安徽省药材部门突出政治，从促进中药材生产入手，做好收购和供应工作。今年以来安徽省许多主要中药材的收购量比去年同期显著增加。如白芍的收购量比去年全年的收购量还多百分之四十，茯苓也比去年增长百分之三十。目前全年各种中药材的收购任务已经完成百分之七十五以上。
    此外，还收购到了一些原来靠外省调进的常用药材，如黄连、麦冬、芋肉、厚朴等。
