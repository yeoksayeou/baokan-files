India is in a state of great turmoil. Since the beginning of this year, the struggles of the Indian people have been escalating, and the reactionary rule of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie has become increasingly unstable.

	Class Struggles Becoming Sharper

India was originally a British colony. After gaining independence in 1950, the big landlords and big bourgeoisie imposed a dictatorship over the broad masses of the people. Chairman Mao, in analyzing China's landlord class and comprador class, pointed out, "These classes represent China's most backward and most reactionary production relations, obstructing the development of China's productive forces. ... Especially the big landlord class and big comprador class, they always stand on the side of imperialism, are the most extreme counter-revolutionaries." The big landlords and big bourgeoisie in India are precisely such reactionaries.

India is a country with a population of over 400 million, with a hardworking people and abundant resources. However, in India, only 15% of the rural population, the landlords and rich peasants, own 85% of the arable land, ruthlessly exploiting and oppressing the 85% of the rural population who are poor peasants and middle peasants. Therefore, Indian agriculture is backward, and there are food shortages every year; the lives of the vast majority of peasants are extremely miserable.

The big bourgeoisie in India, together with the big bureaucrats and foreign capitalists, monopolize the economic lifelines of the country, also obstructing the development of the Indian economy. Workers are ruthlessly exploited and live in misery. Even the officially acknowledged unemployed number one million. General intellectuals also have no way out, and life is very difficult.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The struggles between the Indian workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the big landlords and big bourgeoisie have never stopped and have become increasingly intense.

	Kicking the Stone to Hit One's Own Feet

The Indian reactionaries, in order to maintain their reactionary rule, have leaned on U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, hoping to rely on their "aid" to live. At the same time, they eagerly serve U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, crazily anti-China, attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to realize their own expansionist ambitions.

So far, India has borrowed tens of billions of dollars and 40 million tons of grain from the United States, and a large amount of money from the Soviet Union, becoming the country with the most debt in the world. However, a large part of the money India borrows every year has to be used to repay debts, pay interest, and transport costs for grain. U.S. grain "aid" has destroyed Indian agriculture, making Indian grain production even less. As a result, the more U.S. "aid" is needed, the more difficult it becomes, and the more difficult it becomes, the more U.S. "aid" is needed. U.S. imperialism takes the opportunity to extend its aggressive forces into India, step by step turning India into its colony.

The Indian reactionaries have always had ambitions for China's Tibet. With the support of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, they provoked the Sino-Indian border conflict, crazily anti-China. They use anti-China as an excuse to engage in large-scale military buildup, ruthlessly plundering the blood and sweat of the people. However, the result of the Indian reactionaries' anti-China is that they kicked the stone to hit their own feet, only making the domestic situation in India more chaotic, the economy more difficult, and the people more dissatisfied.

	People's Struggles Continue to Develop

Last year and this year, India suffered from droughts, and the evil consequences of the Indian reactionaries' reactionary policies were more clearly exposed. Serious famines occurred throughout India, and many people starved to death. Since the beginning of this year, workers, peasants, and intellectuals in various parts of India have launched large-scale mass struggles against hunger and for survival. The Indian government carried out brutal suppression, which further aroused the strong resistance of the masses. Recently, the scale of mass struggles has become even larger. The broad masses have put forward the demand to overthrow the reactionary government. On November 7, a demonstration of 700,000 people against the government took place in the Indian capital, New Delhi, forcing the Indian government to dismiss the Minister of the Interior.

The Indian government wants to use brutal suppression and political deception to extinguish the people's struggles. However, as the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out, "The brutal suppression, frenzied attacks, and bribery and deception of the revolutionary masses by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various countries cannot save them from their doom, but can only further promote the revolutionary awakening of the people of various countries." No matter how many difficulties and twists and turns lie ahead, the struggles of the Indian people will definitely continue to develop.

### 印度在大动荡中

    印度在大动荡中
    印度出现了大动荡的局面。从今年年初开始，印度人民斗争越来越高涨，印度大地主大资产阶级的反动统治越来越不稳了。
        阶级斗争越来越尖锐
    印度本来是英国的殖民地，一九五○年独立以后，大地主大资产阶级对广大人民实行专政。毛主席在分析中国的地主阶级和买办阶级的时候曾经指出，“这些阶级代表中国最落后的和最反动的生产关系，阻碍中国生产力的发展。……特别是大地主阶级和大买办阶级，他们始终站在帝国主义一边，是极端的反革命派。”印度的大地主大资产阶级，也就是这样的反动派。
    印度是一个有四亿多人口的大国，人民勤劳，资源丰富。但是，在印度只占农村人口百分之十五的地主富农，占有了全国百分之八十五的耕地，残酷剥削压迫占农村人口百分之八十五的贫雇农和中农。因此，印度农业生产落后，年年闹粮荒；广大农民生活痛苦极了。
    印度的大资产阶级同大官僚和外国资本家勾结到一起，垄断国家经济命脉，也阻碍了印度经济的发展。工人受到残酷剥削，生活很苦。失业的光是官方承认的就有一千万人。一般知识分子也没有出路，日子非常难过。
    有压迫，就有反抗。印度工人、农民、知识分子同大地主、大资产阶级之间的斗争，一直没有断过，并且越来越激烈了。
        搬起石头砸自己的脚
    印度反动派为了保住自己的反动统治，投靠美帝、苏修，想靠它们的“援助”过日子。同时它竭力替美帝苏修效劳，疯狂反华，企图乘机实现自己的扩张野心。
    到现在为止，印度已经向美国借了几十亿美元、四千万吨粮食，向苏联也借了大量的钱，成了世界上欠债最多的国家。但是，印度每年借来的钱，很大一部分要用来还债、付利息和粮食的运费。美国的粮食“援助”摧残了印度农业，弄得印度粮食产量更少了。结果，越要美“援”越困难，越困难越要美“援”，美帝国主义就乘机把它的侵略势力伸进了印度，一步一步地把印度变成它的殖民地。
    印度反动派对中国的西藏一向是有野心的。它在美帝、苏修支持下挑起中印边境冲突，疯狂反华。它拿反华当借口，大搞扩军备战，拚命搜刮人民的血汗。但是，印度反动派反华的结果是搬起石头砸了自己的脚，只是使印度国内局势更加混乱，经济更加困难，人民更加不满。
        人民斗争在继续发展
    去年和今年印度遇到旱灾，印度反动派反动政策的恶果就更清楚地暴露出来了。印度全国发生严重饥荒，饿死了大批人。从今年年初起，印度各地的工人、农民、知识分子掀起了大规模的反饥饿、求生存的群众斗争。印度政府进行疯狂镇压，更激起了群众强烈的反抗。最近，群众斗争的规模更大了。广大人民提出了打倒反动政府的要求。十一月七日，印度首都新德里发生了七十万人的反对政府的大示威，迫使印度政府不得不罢了内政部长的官。
    印度政府想用疯狂镇压和政治欺骗的两手，来扑灭人民的斗争。但是，正如中国共产党八届十一中全会公报所指出的，“美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗对革命群众的残酷镇压、疯狂进攻和收买欺骗，都不能挽救他们灭亡的命运，相反，只能进一步地促进各国人民的革命觉醒。”不管前面还有多少困难和曲折，印度人民的斗争一定还要继续发展下去。（附图片）
    七日，印度首都新德里爆发反政府大示威。愤怒的群众放火焚烧议会大厦附近印度政府的一些部门，议会大街上浓烟滚滚。
