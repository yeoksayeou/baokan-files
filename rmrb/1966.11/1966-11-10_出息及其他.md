What is prosperity? To strive for communism, to strive for world revolution, that is prosperity. Only when the world revolution succeeds will the poor of the world be completely liberated.

The workplace is not a ladder for pursuing personal fame and gain, but a battlefield for the communist revolution. In this battle, the greater the contribution to the Party, the more prosperous and glorious one is.

Revolutionary soldiers endure the hardships of revolution so that the broad masses of the people can enjoy the sweetness of revolution; this generation endures the hardships of revolution so that future generations can enjoy the sweetness of revolution.

Hardship is a test for revolutionary soldiers.

Hardship, if one only thinks of oneself, is bitter; if one thinks of the people, it becomes sweet. Hardship, if one fears it, is bitter; if one despises it and consciously overcomes it, it becomes joy. To contribute to the great cause of communism is the greatest sweetness.

In facing hardships and difficulties, there is only one word: fight!

To be able to serve the people, to do the dirtiest, hardest, most tiring, and most difficult work for the revolution, is one's greatest happiness in life. For the people, for the revolution, the steeper the mountain, the more enjoyable it is to climb; the stronger the wind, the more refreshing it is to feel on one's body; the colder the water, the more intimate it is to wade through; the greater the difficulties and the harsher the environment, the happier one feels.

The transformation of one's thoughts is like this: on one side is the public, on the other side is the private. The more private thoughts, the less public; the fewer private thoughts, the more public; to be completely selfless is to be completely for the public.

    什么是出息？搞共产主义，搞世界革命，就是出息。只有世界革命成功，才有天下穷人的彻底解放。
    工作岗位不是追求个人名利的台阶，是搞共产主义革命的战场。在这场战斗中，为党作的贡献越大，就越有出息，越光荣。
    革命战士吃尽革命的苦，广大人民才能得到革命的甜；这辈人吃尽革命的苦，后辈人才能得到革命的甜。
    苦，是对革命战士的考验。
    苦，只想到个人，是苦；想到人民，就是甜。苦，怕它，就是苦；藐视它，自觉战胜它，就是乐。能为共产主义伟大事业献出力量，就是最大的甜。
    对待艰苦困难，只有一个字：斗！
    能为人民服务，能为革命做最脏、最苦、最累、最难的工作，是自己一生最大的幸福。为了人民，为了革命，山陡，爬起来感到愉快；风大，吹到身上感到轻松；水凉，趟起来感到亲切；困难越大，环境越艰苦，越感到高兴。
    人的思想改造就是这样子：一面是公，一面是私。私多了，公就少；私少了，公就多；彻底无私，就能完全为公。
