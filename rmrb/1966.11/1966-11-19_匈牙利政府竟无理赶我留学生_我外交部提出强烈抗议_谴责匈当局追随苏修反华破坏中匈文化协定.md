The Hungarian government has unreasonably expelled our students. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a strong protest. We condemn the Hungarian authorities for following the Soviet revisionists in their anti-China stance and for sabotaging the Sino-Hungarian cultural agreement.

New China News Agency, November 18th: On November 17th, Yu Zhen, Director of the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country, summoned the Hungarian Ambassador to China, Hela Si, and read out a memorandum to him. The memorandum strongly protested against the Hungarian government's sabotage of cultural cooperation between the two countries, its deterioration of Sino-Hungarian relations, and its unreasonable decision to prevent five of our students from continuing their studies in Hungary. The full text of the memorandum is as follows:

Memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China to the Hungarian Embassy in China

On November 2, 1966, the Deputy Director of the International Liaison Department of the Hungarian Ministry of Education, Hegesu, met with the Second Secretary of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Hungary, Deng Pei, to respond to the memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China to the Hungarian Embassy in China dated October 17, 1966. He stated that five Chinese students would not be allowed to continue their studies in Hungary and ordered them to vacate the student dormitories by November 6. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China strongly protests against this unilateral action by the Hungarian government, which sabotages cultural cooperation between the two countries and deteriorates Sino-Hungarian relations.

In order to uphold the cultural cooperation agreement between China and Hungary, the Chinese side has repeatedly made efforts to resolve the issue of students from both countries continuing their studies. Although the Hungarian Embassy in China stated in its memorandum dated August 24, 1965, regarding the dispatch of five students to China for a one-year study of Chinese in the 1965-1966 academic year, that their study period was one year, and the Hungarian side had no right to request that two students continue their studies in China on Xixia history and classical Chinese, the Chinese side repeatedly expressed its willingness to consider the Hungarian side's request. In the memorandum dated October 17, 1966, the Chinese side clearly stated: "We welcome these two students to continue their studies in China," believing that "the dispute over the interpretation of the memorandum dated August 24, 1965, has no practical significance and should not continue," and further stated:

"If the Hungarian side is willing, not only can we consider sending two students, but even if more students are requested to come to China to study, we can consider it." Unfortunately, the Hungarian government not only did not consider the Chinese side's pragmatic approach to solving the problem, but even before it had read the full text of the Chinese memorandum, it hastily notified the Chinese side that it insisted on stopping the Chinese students' studies in Hungary. This fully exposes your intention to expel Chinese students and your determination to sabotage the Sino-Hungarian cultural cooperation agreement. Your talk of "having the desire to develop cultural relations between the two countries," "not closing the door," and "reconsidering" the issue of students from both countries continuing their studies is completely hypocritical, and your purpose is to cover up your actions that sabotage relations between the two countries.

It should also be pointed out that your expulsion of our students is not accidental but is closely related to your consistent following of Soviet revisionist anti-China policies. Recently, when the Soviet revisionist leadership expelled our students, you also expelled our students; when the Soviet revisionists launched a large-scale anti-China campaign, you also published a large number of anti-China articles, viciously attacking our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and domestic and foreign policies. We honestly tell you that you will not get good results by doing this.

    匈牙利政府竟无理赶我留学生
    我外交部提出强烈抗议
    谴责匈当局追随苏修反华破坏中匈文化协定
    新华社十八日讯　十一月十七日我国外交部苏联东欧司司长余湛召见匈牙利驻华大使郝拉思，向他宣读了一份备忘录，对匈牙利政府破坏中匈两国文化合作，恶化中匈两国关系，无理决定不准我五名留学生继续在匈牙利学习，提出强烈抗议。备忘录全文如下：
    中国外交部给匈牙利驻华大使馆的备忘录
    一九六六年十一月二日，匈牙利文教部国际联络司副司长赫格居斯约见中华人民共和国驻匈牙利大使馆二等秘书邓培，答复中华人民共和国外交部一九六六年十月十七日致匈牙利驻华使馆的备忘录，表示中国五名留学生不能继续在匈学习，并限令他们于十一月六日前撤出匈牙利学生宿舍。中华人民共和国外交部对匈牙利政府这一片面破坏两国文化合作、恶化中匈两国关系的行为，提出强烈的抗议。
    中国方面为了维护中匈两国的文化合作协定，曾经一再努力寻求解决两国留学生继续在对方学习的问题。尽管匈牙利驻华使馆在一九六五年八月二十四日就匈牙利派遣五名留学生于一九六五——一九六六年度到中国进修中文的备忘录中明明白白地说，他们的学习期限为一年，匈方本已无权要求两名留学生继续在中国学习西夏史和古代汉语，中国方面仍然一再表示愿意考虑匈方的要求。在一九六六年十月十七日的备忘录中，中国方面明确表示：“我们欢迎你们这两个留学生继续到中国学习”，认为“关于如何解释一九六五年八月二十四日的备忘录的争论已经没有任何实际意义，这种争论不应当继续下去”，并进一步表示：
  “如果匈牙利方面愿意，不要说派两个，即使要求派更多的留学生来华学习，我们也可以考虑”。但令人遗憾的是，匈牙利政府不仅不考虑中国方面这种实事求是解决问题的意见，甚至连中国的备忘录的全文都还没有看，就匆匆忙忙通知中国方面，坚持要中国学生停止在匈牙利的学习。这就充分地暴露了你们蓄意要赶走中国留学生，决心破坏中匈文化合作协定的真面目。你们所说的什么“抱有发展两国文化关系的愿望”，“不关死”“重新考虑”解决两国留学生继续学习问题的“门”，完全是虚伪的，其目的是为了替你们破坏两国关系的行为打掩护。
    还应该指出，你们赶我们的留学生绝不是偶然的，是同你们一贯追随苏联修正主义反华分不开的。最近，苏联修正主义领导集团赶我们的留学生，你们也跟着赶我们的留学生；苏联修正主义大肆反华，你们也跟着发表了大量反华文章，恶毒地攻击我国文化大革命和国内外政策。我们愿意老实告诉你们，你们这样做是决不会得到好结果的。
   　一九六六年十一月十七日于北京
