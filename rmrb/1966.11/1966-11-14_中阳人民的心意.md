On November 10, at the southwestern corner of Tiananmen Square, one group stood out particularly excited. They gazed up at the Tiananmen Gate, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

This group was composed of student representatives from Zhongyang County, Shanxi Province. Before setting out, they specially selected the largest and reddest dates from the Sanjiao Commune, packaging them in transparent plastic bags as a gift from the 130,000 people of the entire county to Chairman Mao. On each bag, they wrote in red paint:

	"Ten thousand red dates, ten thousand hearts,
	Each red heart turns to Beijing,
	The revolutionary people love you the most,
	Great leader Mao Zedong!"

The students and teachers of Zhongyang County specially chose the dates from Sanjiao Commune to present to Chairman Mao with a special intention. In February 1936, after the 25,000-mile Long March, the Red Army of workers and peasants crossed the Yellow River from Shaanxi to the north to resist Japan, and it was in Sanjiao that they landed. This time, the people of Zhongyang used the specialty product of Sanjiao, the big red dates, as a gift to Chairman Mao to express their determination to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the Red Army of workers and peasants, to carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, and to carry out the socialist revolution to the end.

    中阳人民的心意
    十一月十日，在天安门广场的西南角，有一支队伍显得格外激动。他们仰望着天安门城楼，不停地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    这支队伍是山西省中阳县的学生代表。他们动身以前，特意从三交公社选了一些最大最红的红枣，分装在透明的塑料袋里，作为全县十三万人民送给毛主席的礼物。每个袋子上面，还用红漆写了四句话：
      “万颗红枣万颗心，
    颗颗红心向北京，
    革命人民最爱您，
    伟大领袖毛泽东！”
    中阳县革命师生特意选三交公社的红枣献给毛主席，是有一番心意的。一九三六年二月，经过二万五千里长征的工农红军，从陕西东渡黄河北上抗日的时候，就是在三交上岸的。这次，中阳人民用三交的特产大红枣作为献给毛主席的礼物，是要向伟大领袖毛主席表示决心，要继承和发扬工农红军的革命精神，在毛主席亲自领导下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底。
