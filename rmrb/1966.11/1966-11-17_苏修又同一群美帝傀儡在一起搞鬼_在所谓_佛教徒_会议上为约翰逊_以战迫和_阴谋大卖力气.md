The Soviet revisionist leadership group has once again sent representatives to sit alongside the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the puppet regimes of South Vietnam, South Korea, "Malaysia," and others. They participated in the so-called "World Buddhist Fellowship Conference" held from November 6 to 12 in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. This is the sixteenth time since last October that Soviet representatives have sat together with American imperialist puppets in Southeast Asia.

As the vice-chairman of this "World Buddhist Fellowship Conference," the Soviet representative Dikov publicly aligned himself with American imperialism after the conference, speaking to the press. He did not condemn the American aggressors who are slaughtering the Vietnamese people but instead irresponsibly claimed that "mutual slaughter" is occurring in Vietnam. He did not demand that the American aggressors withdraw unconditionally from South Vietnam but instead, in accordance with the so-called "withdrawal proposal" concocted by U.S. President Johnson at the Manila conference, which calls for the Vietnamese people to surrender to American bandits, he shouted that "the best way to end the war is for the armies of all countries to withdraw from Vietnam." This once again exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists.

    苏修又同一群美帝傀儡在一起搞鬼
    在所谓“佛教徒”会议上为约翰逊“以战迫和”阴谋大卖力气
    新华社十五日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道：苏联修正主义领导集团又派出代表，同蒋介石匪帮和南越、南朝鲜、“马来西亚”等傀儡集团的代表坐在一起，出席了十一月六日到十二日在泰国北部清迈府举行的所谓“世界佛教徒联谊会”会议。这是从去年十月以来，苏联代表第十六次在东南亚地区同美帝国主义的傀儡坐在一起勾勾搭搭。
    作为这个“世界佛教徒联谊会”副主席的苏联代表迪科夫在会后向报界发表谈话时，公然同美帝国主义一个鼻孔出气，为美国的“以战迫和”阴谋效劳。他不去谴责屠杀越南人民的美国侵略者，却不分是非地胡说什么“在越南发生了互相残杀”。他不要求美国侵略者无条件撤出南越，竟然按照美国总统约翰逊在马尼拉会议上炮制的要越南人民向美国强盗投降的所谓“撤军建议”，叫嚷什么“消弭（战争）的最佳方法，便是各国军队应撤离越南”。这就再一次暴露了苏联修正主义者的叛徒嘴脸。
