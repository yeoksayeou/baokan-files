U.S. and Chiang KMT Tighten Collusion and Plot New Schemes

Bundy in Manila Meeting After Going to Taiwan to Plot New Conspiracies with Chiang KMT Leaders

New China News Agency, November 5th: Johnson's advisor, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs William Bundy, recently went to Taiwan to engage in conspiratorial activities, promoting Johnson's government's policy of aggression, and madly issuing war threats.

Bundy, following Johnson in the "Manila Meeting" to plot the expansion of the war of aggression, went to Taiwan from November 2nd to 4th to engage in activities, "promoting" the Chiang KMT's understanding of the various contents of the "Manila Meeting," and discussing "other issues in Asia." Bundy in Taipei madly issued war threats, saying, "We must resolutely continue the Vietnam War, for as long as necessary, we will continue it"; at the same time, he said, "The U.S. is currently in contact with the Soviet Union regarding the current situation," and "will continue to seek peace in Vietnam."

During Bundy's stay in Taiwan, he held secret talks with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and other Chiang KMT leaders such as Yen Chia-kan, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Wei Tao-ming, discussing further collusion between the U.S. and Chiang KMT to "cope with the new situation" and other issues, plotting new conspiracies to expand the war of aggression.
