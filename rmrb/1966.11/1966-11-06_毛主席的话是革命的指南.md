Chairman Mao Zedong is the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world. I am determined to take his words as my guide in world affairs.

I will dedicate myself to uniting a group of young people, arming them with Mao Zedong Thought, and leading them on the revolutionary path to fight all forms of imperialism and colonialism to the very end, until final victory.  A teacher from Nigeria
