	Relying on the Masses to Be Invincible
	Vice Commander of a Certain Division of the Air Force, Zhao De'an

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous, not understanding this, one cannot gain even the most basic knowledge." We must firmly remember this instruction and resolutely carry it out.

	Believe in the Masses, Rely on the Masses to Win Battles

	Some people think that military commanders are "imposing and formidable," and that everything is done by command. This is a bourgeois military ideology, a reflection of bourgeois individual heroism. Our great model of proletarian military commanders is our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and respects the masses' pioneering spirit the most. We must learn from the great leader's shining example, first learn from the masses, then issue commands; and pay special attention to bringing out the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity.

	Last year, Comrade Gao Changji shot down an enemy RF-101 supersonic reconnaissance aircraft. This is a good example. Before the battle, the commander and the pilots, navigators, and others studied Chairman Mao's works together, came up with ideas, thought of ways, and formulated a relatively complete battle plan. During the battle, because Gao Changji had been chasing for a long time, the fuel in his plane was running low, so the commander ordered him to return. However, Gao Changji saw that he was about to catch up with the enemy plane and decided that he would rather sacrifice himself than fail to destroy the enemy. He acted decisively, maneuvering the plane to continue the pursuit, and finally shot down the enemy plane, and safely landed at a nearby airfield.

	Pilots are the direct participants in the battle. They understand the actual situation of the battle the best, feel the changes in the situation the quickest, and make judgments and decide on actions. Therefore, a good commander must rely on the masses, fully practice democracy, listen to the masses' opinions, and then make decisions.

	Every victory in our air battles is achieved by practicing democracy and bringing out the masses' creativity. In the eyes of bourgeois military commanders, the masses are merely mechanical "machines" that execute commands. In our eyes, the masses are heroes with boundless creativity. Without these heroes, there would be no victories; relying on these heroes, we are invincible.

	Learn Humble from Revolutionary "Youngsters"

	The more battles one fights, the more experience one accumulates, and gradually one seems to think that one is more clever than others. In fact, at any time, the most clever are the masses.

	When I was a squadron commander, a batch of new pilots was assigned to me. At first, I thought that whatever I taught the new pilots would seem fresh to them, and all I had to do was "pour" the knowledge into them. After the new pilots arrived, I soon realized that my original idea was wrong. Although they had less experience, they studied Chairman Mao's works well, dared to think, dared to speak, dared to act, dared to venture, and dared to make revolution. New pilot Gao Guangfei spoke less in meetings. Once, when I proposed a new tactic, Gao Guangfei spoke up. He said, "This tactic is wrong!" I immediately felt my face flush. But then I thought, he dared to oppose my opinion, which shows that he dares to think. I paid special attention to listening to his speech. As he spoke, other comrades added to it, and the more I listened, the more I felt he was right, and the more I felt my own brain was becoming smarter. I felt that under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, one generation is indeed stronger than the next. Finally, I said, "Your opinion is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, I will follow your opinion." This incident taught me that one must never believe in one's own cleverness and must never look down on the "youngsters." Believing in the masses means believing in both the old and the new; the "youngsters" have their own strengths. Chairman Mao said, "Officials should learn from the soldiers, turning others' experiences into their own, and their abilities will be greater." We must honestly listen to Chairman Mao's words and firmly believe in the masses at all times, treating the masses as our teachers.

    依靠群众　所向无敌
    空军部队某师副师长　赵德安
    毛主席教导我们说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我们必须牢记这一指示，坚决执行这一指示。
  相信群众、依靠群众
      才能打胜仗
    有人认为，军事指挥员是“威风凛凛”的，一切靠命令行事。这是资产阶级的军事思想，是资产阶级个人英雄主义的反映。我们无产阶级军事指挥员的伟大典范，是我们的伟大统帅毛主席。毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众，最尊重群众的首创精神。我们要学习伟大统帅的光辉榜样，先向群众学习，再发命令；并且十分注意发挥群众的革命积极性和创造性。
    去年高长吉同志打下敌RF—101超音速侦察机的战斗，就是这样的情况。临战前，指挥员和飞行员、领航员等一起学习毛主席著作，出主意，想办法，制定了比较完善的作战方案。在战斗中，由于高长吉追击的时间较长，飞机上的油不多了，指挥员命令他返航。但是，高长吉同志眼看就要追上敌机，决心宁可牺牲自己，也一定要消灭敌人。他当机立断，操纵飞机继续追击，终于将敌机击落，并且安全地在友邻机场着陆。
    飞行员是战斗的直接参加者。他们最了解战斗的实际情况，最迅速地感觉到情况的变化，并作出判断，决定作战的行动。因此，一个好的指挥员，必须依靠群众，充分发扬民主，听取群众的意见，然后作出决定。
    我们空战的每一次胜利，都是靠发扬民主、发挥群众的创造性而取得的。在资产阶级军事指挥员的眼里，群众只是机械地执行命令的“机器”。在我们无产阶级军事指挥员的眼里，群众是具有无限创造力的英雄，没有这些英雄就没有胜利，依靠这些英雄就所向无敌。虚心向革命“小将”学习
    仗打得多一点，经验也累垒得多了，慢慢地好像觉得自己比别人更高明一些。其实，不管任何时候，最高明的还是群众。
    我当大队长的时候，调来一批新飞行员。起初我想，给新飞行员讲什么他们都会感到新鲜，只要“灌”就行了。新飞行员来到之后，我很快觉得原来的想法不对头。他们虽然经验少，但是学习毛主席著作好，敢想，敢说，敢干，敢闯，敢革命。新飞行员高光飞，开会发言比较少。有一次，我提出一种新的打法时，高光飞发言了。他说：“这种打法不对！”我顿时脸上发红。但我又一想，他敢于反对我的意见，说明他肯于动脑筋。我就特别注意听他的发言。他一说，其他同志再补充，我越听越觉得他讲的对，越听越觉得自己的脑子也变得聪明起来。我觉得在毛泽东思想的哺育下，真是一代比一代强。最后我表示：“你的意见符合毛泽东思想，我服从你的。”这件事教育了我，千万不能迷信自己高明，千万不要轻视“小将”。相信群众不仅要相信老的，也要相信新的，“小将”有
  “小将”的特长。毛主席说：“当官的要向战士学习，把别人的经验变成自己的，他的本领就大了。”我们要老老实实地听毛主席的话，任何时候都坚定地相信群众，拜群众为师。
