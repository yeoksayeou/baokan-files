The United States Plays a New Trick of "Two Chinas" in the UN
Rallying Some Followers to Continue Obstructing the Restoration of China's Legitimate Rights

	NEW YORK, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations General Assembly began debating the so-called issue of Chinese representation on Nov. 18.

	This session of the United Nations General Assembly on the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights is being held at a time when China's international prestige and influence are at an unprecedented height, and when the calls from countries around the world to restore China's legitimate rights in the United Nations are becoming increasingly strong. On one hand, the United States has rallied Japan, Thailand, and a few other lackey countries to once again propose the so-called "important question" (referring to the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights, which requires a two-thirds majority to decide), attempting to use this old trick to continue excluding China's legitimate representatives from the United Nations. At the same time, it has instigated Canada, Italy, and other countries to play a new trick of creating "two Chinas" as a "second line of defense" to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate representation.

	On Nov. 18, at the beginning of the debate, the Italian representative Pizzioni threw out a proposal that essentially advocates for "two Chinas." On Nov. 21, Italy, together with Brazil, Bolivia, Belgium, and other countries that proposed the "important question" with the United States, formally submitted a proposal to the General Assembly. The proposal advocates for the establishment of a "committee" by the General Assembly to "explore and study" various aspects of the so-called "Chinese representation issue" under the premise of "considering the current situation and political realities in this region" (referring to China), and to make "appropriate recommendations" to the next session of the General Assembly on a "fair and practical solution" to this issue.

	This is a serious step taken by U.S. imperialism to create "two Chinas" within the United Nations. The Italian ambassador to the United Nations, Finzi, bluntly advocated for the idea that there should be "two Chinas" representatives within the United Nations when explaining this proposal.

	The purpose of the United States in drafting such a proposal is also to shift the blame for the United States continuing to manipulate the United Nations to exclude China's legitimate representatives onto the Chinese people who are being excluded. China's stance on the United Nations controlled by the United States and the Soviet Union is well known, but Pizzioni said in his speech on Nov. 18 that the "committee" to be established is supposed to "explore and study" the so-called "Beijing's ideas on representation in the United Nations and whether it is willing to abide by the San Francisco (United Nations) Charter." It is obvious that the United States intends to, under the condition that China rejects the "two Chinas" trap and rejects the situation where the United States and the Soviet Union manipulate and control the United Nations, blame China's deprivation of legitimate rights on China's "self-isolation" from the United Nations.

	Goldberg, after Italy and other countries formally submitted this proposal on Nov. 21, made a speech clearly stating that "the United States will vote in favor" of this proposal.

	To justify the United States' increasingly unpopular policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, this U.S. representative once again used the logic of imperialist bandits, shamelessly slandering China. He put all sorts of strange accusations on the Chinese people and specifically attacked the revolutionary actions of the "Red Guards" during China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He admitted that the revolutionary actions of the "Red Guards" made the United States "anxious."

	The new conspiracy plotted by the United States has been widely exposed and opposed since its inception. The representatives of Albania, Cambodia, Guinea, Tanzania, Burma, and Congo (Brazzaville) in their speeches firmly refuted the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to create "two Chinas." They unanimously demanded the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and the expulsion of the so-called "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek remnants from the United Nations.

    美国在联大玩弄“两个中国”新阴谋
    纠集一些追随者千方百计继续阻挠恢复中国的合法权利
    据新华社二十二日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会十八日开始辩论所谓中国代表权问题。
    这届联合国大会关于恢复中国合法权利问题的辩论，是在中国的国际威望和影响空前高涨，世界上主持正义的各国要求恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的呼声越来越强烈的情况下举行的。美国一方面纠集日本、泰国等一小撮仆从国家，再次提出了所谓“重要问题”（按指恢复中国合法权利的问题是一个需要三分之二的多数才能决定的问题）的提案，妄图利用这个老手法来继续排斥中国人民的合法代表于联合国之外；与此同时，它又唆使加拿大、意大利等国玩弄制造“两个中国”的新花招，作为阻挠恢复中国合法代表权的“第二道防线”。
    意大利代表皮齐奥尼在十八日辩论一开始就抛出了实质上是鼓吹“两个中国”的荒谬主张。二十一日，意大利又伙同追随美国一道提出所谓“重要问题”提案的巴西、玻利维亚、比利时等五国，正式向大会提出了一项提案，鼓吹在“考虑这个地区（按指中国）目前存在的局势和政治现实情况”的前提下，由联大指定一些国家成立一个“委员会”来“探讨和研究”所谓“中国代表权问题”的“各个方面”，并就这个问题的“一项公正和切实的解决办法”向下届联大提出“适当的建议”。
    这是美帝国主义企图在联合国内制造“两个中国”的一个严重的步骤。意大利驻联合国大使芬奇在解释这个提案时露骨地鼓吹，联合国内应该有“两个中国”的代表。
    美国策划这样一个提案的目的还在于把美国继续操纵联合国排斥中国人民的合法代表的罪责转嫁在受排斥的中国人民头上。中国对美苏控制下的联合国的立场是尽人皆知的，但是皮齐奥尼在十八日的发言中却说什么建议成立的这个“委员会”所要“探讨和研究”的是所谓“北京对联合国中代表权的想法，以及它是否愿意遵守旧金山（联合国）宪章”的问题。很显然，美国妄图在中国拒绝接受“两个中国”的圈套，拒绝接受美苏操纵、控制联合国的局面的情况下，把中国的被剥夺合法权利，说成是中国“自我孤立”于联合国之外。
    戈德堡在二十一日意大利等国正式提出这项提案后发言，明确表示“美国将投票赞成”这项提案。
    为了给美国坚持敌视中国人民的这种越来越不得人心的政策辩解，这个美国代表又一次运用帝国主义的强盗逻辑，横肆诬蔑中国。他在中国人民头上加了种种稀奇古怪的“罪名”，并且特别对中国无产阶级文化大革命中“红卫兵”小将们的革命行动进行攻击。他承认，“红卫兵”小将们的革命行动使美国“感到不安”。
    美国一手策划的这个新阴谋一出笼就遭到了广泛的揭露和反对。阿尔巴尼亚、柬埔寨、几内亚、坦桑尼亚、缅甸、刚果（布）等国代表在发言中坚决驳斥了美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。他们一致要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，把蒋介石残余匪帮的所谓“代表”驱逐出联合国。
