The Guanghua Ship Holds a Grand Meeting to Warmly Welcome the Second Batch of Indonesian Overseas Chinese Victims Returning to the Motherland

Chairman Mao cares deeply for overseas Chinese; overseas Chinese love Chairman Mao endlessly. The reception team members solemnly distributed "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao badges to the victims. The victims expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's works diligently and contribute their strength to the socialist motherland.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 24th: Guanghua Ship News: On the 21st, a grand meeting was held on the Guanghua Ship during its return voyage to warmly welcome the second batch of Indonesian overseas Chinese victims returning to the motherland.

This was a meeting filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the great socialist motherland. Under the giant portrait of Chairman Mao and the five-starred national flag on the deck, the head of the reception team on board said to the victims: "Our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao cares deeply for overseas Chinese. The crew of the Guanghua Ship is entrusted by Chairman Mao and the 700 million people of the motherland to go to Indonesia to bring you back to the motherland!" At this moment, the entire scene was filled with excitement, and many victims shed tears of emotion. Everyone spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Thank you, Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland for your care!"

During the meeting, the reception team members solemnly distributed "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao badges to the victims. Forty-one young victims who had been imprisoned and suffered political persecution by the Indonesian reactionaries but had broken free and returned to the motherland received "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao badges first. The crew of the Guanghua Ship specially made red bookmarks with "Serve the People" printed on them and placed them in the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" books to give to them. The forty-one young people held up the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and solemnly swore before Chairman Mao's portrait: "We will resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao!" Following this, this combat unit armed with Mao Zedong Thought sang the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" song with great enthusiasm.

Among the forty-one young people, Yu Yazhou spoke on behalf of all the victims at the welcome meeting. He said excitedly: "The victory of the anti-persecution struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia is a victory of great Mao Zedong Thought. We have a powerful socialist motherland and 700 million people of the motherland who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought as a strong backing, and we are not afraid of anything!"

Yu Yazhou said that the Indonesian reactionaries arbitrarily arrested and tortured us. However, we did not surrender to the enemy and carried out a hunger strike. We collectively recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory." At the most difficult moment, when we thought of the affectionate instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, we gained boundless confidence and strength. Our struggle's victory once again proved Chairman Mao's wise judgment: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."

Yu Yazhou said that great Mao Zedong Thought is our spiritual atomic bomb. After returning to the great motherland, we will definitely study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, learn the revolutionary rebel spirit of the Red Guards of the motherland, and contribute all our strength to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland.

When the victims received "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao badges, they were extremely excited, and one by one, they raised their arms and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" The victims said that as soon as they boarded the motherland's reception ship, they received "Quotations from Chairman Mao." This is a joyous event that we will never forget in our lifetime. Female victim Huang Ruqiao held up "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and solemnly said: "I am determined to truly master Mao Zedong Thought!"

During the meeting, the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and slogans like "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed continuously. Many victims immediately opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gazing affectionately at Chairman Mao's portrait in front of the text, and then read Chairman Mao's quotations aloud. Some victims also wrote down this memorable happy moment on the front page of "Quotations from Chairman Mao": "November 21, 1966, on the Guanghua Ship."

    毛主席非常关心华侨  华侨无限热爱毛主席
    接侨工作人员向难侨隆重分发《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。难侨们表示决心努力活学活用毛主席著作，为社会主义祖国贡献力量
    据新华社二十四日讯　光华轮消息：在返航途中的光华轮上，二十一日举行了盛大集会，热烈欢迎第二批回国的受害印度尼西亚华侨。
    这是一次充满着对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大社会主义祖国无限热爱的大会。在挂着毛主席巨幅画像和五星国旗的船顶甲板上，随船接侨工作组负责人向难侨们说：“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席非常关心华侨。光华轮船员是受毛主席和祖国七亿人民的重托，到印尼接你们回国的！”这时，全场情绪沸腾，许多难侨流下了激动的热泪。大家情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“感谢毛主席和祖国人民的关怀！”
    会上，接侨工作组工作人员向难侨们隆重地分发了《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。粉碎了印尼反动派的政治迫害阴谋，胜利出狱回国的四十一名难侨青少年，首先领受《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。光华轮船员特地为他们制作了印有“为人民服务”的红色书签，夹在《毛主席语录》本里送给他们。四十一名青少年举起红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：“我们坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士！”接着，这个用毛泽东思想武装起来的战斗集体，纵情高唱了刚学会的毛主席语录歌。
    四十一名青少年中的余亚周，代表全船难侨在欢迎大会上讲话。他激动地说：“印度尼西亚爱国华侨反迫害斗争的胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。我们有强大的社会主义祖国和高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的祖国七亿人民作坚强的后盾，什么也不怕！”
    余亚周说，印尼反动派无理逮捕我们，严刑拷打我们。但是，我们决不在敌人面前屈服，进行了绝食斗争。我们集体背诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在最困难的时刻，我们一想起伟大领袖毛主席对我们的亲切教导，就增加了无限的信心和力量。我们斗争的胜利，再一次证明了毛主席的英明论断：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”。
    余亚周说，伟大的毛泽东思想是我们的精神原子弹。我们回到伟大的祖国后，一定更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，学习祖国红卫兵小将的无产阶级革命造反精神，为祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献一切力量。
    难侨们在领受《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章时，心情十分激动，一个个振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”难侨们说，我们登上祖国接侨船就领到《毛主席语录》，这是我们终身难忘的大喜事。难侨女青年黄女娆举起《毛主席语录》庄严地说：“下定决心，我一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手！”
    在大会进行中，《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声和“毛主席万岁！”等口号声连绵不断。许多难侨立即展开《毛主席语录》，深情地看着语录正文前的毛主席像，然后高声朗读毛主席语录。有些难侨还在《毛主席语录》扉页上记下了这个值得纪念的幸福时刻：“一九六六年十一月二十一日于光华轮上”。
