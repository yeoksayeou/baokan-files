Comrade Cai Yongxiang injured his left foot during labor and was hospitalized for nine days. During these short nine days, he did many good deeds. These ordinary actions reflected the excellent qualities of a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

He is a person who "can't sit still." On the second day of his hospitalization, before dawn, he quietly got up to mop the floor and fetch water, working until he was covered in sweat. The night shift nurse saw this and asked him, "Comrade Cai Yongxiang, why did you get up so early?" He smiled and said, "I thought of work, and I couldn't sleep."

Comrade Cai Yongxiang is extremely enthusiastic towards his comrades. There was a patient with appendicitis who had difficulty getting out of bed after surgery. Cai Yongxiang endured his own intense pain and brought food, water, and a urine bottle to the patient. The patient was so moved that he said with tears in his eyes, "Comrade Cai Yongxiang, you are also sick, yet you still take care of me!" Cai Yongxiang said, "This is what Chairman Mao taught me to do. Chairman Mao said: 'All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other.'" The other patients present unanimously said, "You do as Chairman Mao says. You care for others more than you care for yourself."

A soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest. Cai Yongxiang is a strong person. Due to an infection in his wound, his foot became red and swollen, and the pain was like being stabbed with needles. However, he never cried out in pain. Sometimes, the doctor would ask him, "Little Cai, does it hurt? Would you like a painkiller?" Cai Yongxiang would always say, "Chairman Mao's words are like ginseng, a soldier reads it and forgets all pain!" According to his condition at the time, he should have received first-class care. However, when the nurse brought him a basin of water to wash his face, he declined, saying, "I'm fine, I can get out of bed to wash my face. You should go take care of the seriously ill comrades." When the nurse brought him meals, he always declined, gritting his teeth and sweating profusely as he hobbled to the dining hall.

No matter how much his foot hurt or how severe his illness was, Cai Yongxiang never neglected studying Chairman Mao's works. He seized every moment of his hospitalization to eagerly study Chairman Mao's works. Sometimes, the doctor and nurse would advise him to rest, but he would seriously reply, "Studying Chairman Mao's works cannot be rested from, ideological reform cannot be rested from, serving the people cannot be rested from; as long as one is alive, one must study, and having studied, one must act." Cai Yongxiang loves Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought immensely. During his hospitalization, when he heard from the radio about anti-party, anti-socialist, and counter-revolutionary elements opposing Mao Zedong Thought, he was so angry that he felt his lungs would burst. He supported his body and participated in the denunciation meeting.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang, you did not die, you will forever live in our hearts. We must be like you, actively applying Chairman Mao's works, better reforming our worldview, and dedicating everything to the revolutionary cause.

    关心别人胜于关心自己
    解放军驻浙某医院外一科医护小组
    蔡永祥同志在劳动中左脚受伤，来我们医院住院治疗九天。在这短短的九天中，他做了不少好事。这些平凡的行动，体现了这个毛主席的好战士的优秀品质。
    他是一个“闲不住”的人。住院的第二天，天蒙蒙亮，他就轻轻地起床擦地板、打开水，忙得满头大汗。夜班护士看到后，关心地问他：“蔡永祥同志，你起得这么早？”他笑了笑说：“想起工作，就睡不着觉了。”
    蔡永祥同志对同志极端热忱。有一个患阑尾炎的病员，手术后下床不方便。蔡永祥同志便忍受着自己伤口的剧烈疼痛，给病员端饭、送水、提小便壶。这个病员感动得含着泪花说：“蔡永祥同志，你也生病呀，还来照顾我！”蔡永祥说：“这是毛主席教导我这样做的。毛主席说：‘一切革命队伍的人，都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。’”在旁的病员听了后，异口同声地说：“毛主席怎么说，你就怎么做。你关心他人就是比关心自己为重。”
    毛泽东思想武装起来的战士最坚强，蔡永祥同志就是一个坚强的人。由于伤口受了感染，他的脚又红又肿，痛得像针扎一样。可是他从没喊过一声痛。有时，医生问他：“小蔡，痛吧？吃片止痛药？”蔡永祥同志总是说：“嗨，毛主席的话是灵芝草，战士读它疼痛全忘掉！”按照他当时的病情是“一级护理”，可是当护士长把洗脸水端到他面前时，他就推辞说：“我很好嘛，能自己下床洗脸，你去多照顾重病员同志吧！”护士把饭菜端到他床边，他总是谢绝，总是咬咬牙，脸上淌着豆大的汗珠，一步一拐地支撑着到饭厅里去。
    脚再痛，病再重，蔡永祥同志学习毛主席著作从不放松。他抓住住院的点滴时间，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。有时，医生和护士劝他休息，他总是认真地回答说：“学习毛主席著作不能休息，思想改造不能休息，为人民服务不能休息；活着就要学，学了就要干。”蔡永祥同志无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想。在住院期间，当他从广播里听到反党反社会主义反革命分子反对毛泽东思想的时候，他的肺都要气炸了。他支撑着身体参加了声讨会。
    蔡永祥同志，你没有死，你永远活在我们心里。我们一定要像你那样活学活用毛主席著作，更好地改造世界观，为革命事业献出一切。
