Red Guards from all over the country have flocked to the banks of the Qiantang River to solemnly pledge: "We will forever be revolutionaries of the Mao Zedong era."

The heroic deeds of Cai Yongxiang, who sacrificed his life to save the Red Guards, have sparked a wave of learning and emulation in his hometown.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 18th: "Comrade Cai Yongxiang, we pledge to you: We will definitely learn from your selfless communist spirit; like you, we will use the revolutionary spirit of 'seizing the day' to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, transform our worldview, and train ourselves to be the red successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

This is the solemn pledge made by the Red Guards from Jian Second Middle School in Jiangxi Province and Longxi Normal School in Fujian Province after visiting the unit where Cai Yongxiang served before his martyrdom. It expresses the hearts of countless revolutionary youths.

Since the day Cai Yongxiang sacrificed his life to save the Red Guards special train, the banks of the Qiantang River have been filled with red flags and surging crowds. Red Guards from the front lines of the East China Sea, the foothills of the Tian Shan Mountains, the banks of the Pearl River, and the slopes of the Changbai Mountains have all come here to study Chairman Mao's works and to set off on their revolutionary journeys. In the unit where Cai Yongxiang served before his martyrdom, they wrote down their pledges to learn from the hero and carry on the martyr's will in the guestbook, filled with excitement.

The Red Guards from Jian Second Middle School and Longxi Normal School, after being reviewed by the great leader Chairman Mao in Beijing, immediately returned to Hangzhou. With reverence in their hearts, they visited the unit where Cai Yongxiang served before his martyrdom to express their respect and condolences. They presented the unit with Mao badges and photographs of Chairman Mao receiving a million revolutionary teachers and students, and they also paid their respects to the relics of Cai Yongxiang. When they saw the two portraits of Chairman Mao that Cai Yongxiang bought just days before his martyrdom and the handwritten quotations from Chairman Mao, the young guards were moved to tears. They recalled Cai Yongxiang's heroic deed of sacrificing his life to save the train, ensuring their safety. With tears in their eyes, they raised their hands in front of Cai Yongxiang's portrait and swore: "Comrade Cai Yongxiang will forever live in our hearts. We will take Cai Yongxiang as our example, learn better from the People's Liberation Army, and forever be revolutionaries of the Mao Zedong era."

A group of Red Guards from Liaodong who were on their way south for revolutionary linking-up, upon seeing the report of Cai Yongxiang's deeds, were deeply moved and hurried to Hangzhou. They asked Cai Yongxiang's former comrades-in-arms and his elder brother Cai Yongsheng, who had just enlisted, to introduce in detail the deeds of the martyr studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They decided that in their actual revolutionary linking-up to the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, they would take the hero as their example, learn from the PLA's "Three-Eight" style, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, overcoming difficulties, and marching on foot to their destination. To show their determination to learn from the PLA, they spent two days picking up white porcelain shards in the rain and laid out the words "Comrade Cai Yongxiang will live forever" in large characters at the site of the unit where Cai Yongxiang served before his martyrdom.

Sixteen Red Guards and revolutionary students from Jiamusi, Heilongjiang Province, who had previously visited the unit where Liu Yingjun served before his martyrdom, also rushed to Hangzhou upon hearing the news. They framed a photograph of Liu Yingjun given to them by his former comrades-in-arms and inscribed it with Chairman Mao's quotation: "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai." They presented this to the unit where Cai Yongxiang served before his martyrdom. The comrades-in-arms of Cai Yongxiang presented them with a portrait of Cai Yongxiang. They excitedly said: "This precious photograph, like the photograph of Liu Yingjun, will inspire us to learn better from the PLA and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution. We will firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, starting from here, and march on foot to various places for revolutionary linking-up, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

The Red Guards and revolutionary students from Zhejiang University, forming a Long March team, marched across the Qiantang River Bridge, holding high red flags and marching in unison. At the place where Cai Yongxiang sacrificed himself, they distributed the Long March Declaration. The declaration read: We will take up Cai Yongxiang's gun, hold high the banner dyed red with the blood of the martyrs, and advance in the footsteps of the heroes! We will declare to the world with our actions that the Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless of heaven, earth, hardship, and death. We will smash the old world and create a new world shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought!

One team after another of Red Guards, drawing new spiritual strength from here, set off on their revolutionary linking-up journey. Many people left poems full of revolutionary spirit before their departure. They wrote:

	Hero Cai Yongxiang, sacrificed himself to save the young guards,
	His deeds will be remembered forever, etched in everyone's heart.
	Red flags flutter over the Qiantang River, Red Guards fear no distant journey,
	Thinking of hero Cai Yongxiang, our spirits soar higher than the sky.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, November 18th: The news of the selfless communist warrior Cai Yongxiang sacrificing his life to save the Red Guards special train spread to his hometown—Hubei Province, Feidong County, Hukou Commune. The commune members and school teachers and students immediately launched a campaign to learn from the hero Cai Yongxiang.

	Cai Yongxiang's home is in Huaguang Brigade, Dacai Village. On the day the news of Cai Yongxiang's martyrdom was announced, all the villagers rushed to the martyr's home to express their condolences to the martyr's parents. They said: "Cai Yongxiang saved the Red Guards in the critical moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, preserving the Qiantang River Bridge. He is truly a good soldier of Chairman Mao. His death is heavier than Mount Tai! This is the glory of all the poor and lower-middle peasants in our commune!" The militia members of the militia class that Cai Yongxiang once led wrote letters of resolve, firmly declaring that they would learn from Cai Yongxiang's selfless spirit and daring to sacrifice, becoming communist warriors like Cai Yongxiang. The entire village's militia, influenced by Cai Yongxiang's noble character, think of the "public" in everything, love the collective, care for others, and many people do good deeds without leaving their names.

	The heroic deeds of Cai Yongxiang sacrificing his life to save the Red Guards special train caused a great shock among the revolutionary teachers and students of Chaohu Middle School in his hometown. They formed teams to visit the martyr's home, presenting the martyr's family with a plaster statue of Chairman Mao brought from Beijing, a quotation board of Chairman Mao's words brought from Shanghai, and a complete set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The primary school where Cai Yongxiang once studied, upon hearing the news of his heroic sacrifice, was immediately moved and launched a campaign to learn from Cai Yongxiang.

	Recently, the six brigades of Hongguang, Yingxia, Hukou, Huaguang, Heishi, and Yujin in Hukou Commune jointly held a meeting to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, with over five thousand people participating. At the meeting, activists who study Chairman Mao's works all took Cai Yongxiang as their example, resolving to study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, apply them for a lifetime, and transform their thoughts for a lifetime.

    红卫兵小将纷纷来到钱塘江畔庄严宣誓：
    永当毛泽东时代革命闯将
    蔡永祥烈士家乡掀起学习英雄事迹热潮
    新华社杭州十八日电  “蔡永祥同志，我们向你宣誓：我们一定要学习你一心为公的共产主义精神；像你那样，用‘只争朝夕’的革命精神，活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的红色接班人。”
    这是乘坐蔡永祥同志舍身抢救的七六四次直达北京的红卫兵专车的江西省吉安第二中学和福建省龙溪师范学校的红卫兵们，访问蔡永祥生前所在连队后，立下的庄严誓言，它表达了千千万万革命小将的颗颗红心。
    自从蔡永祥为抢救红卫兵专车而英勇献身那一天起，钱塘江畔，红旗招展，人海如潮。来自东海前线、天山脚下、珠江之滨、长白山麓的红卫兵们，都把这里作为活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，作为步行串连的出发地。他们在蔡永祥生前所在的连队里，在留言簿上激动地写下了学习英雄、继承烈士遗志的誓言。
    吉安第二中学和龙溪师范学校的红卫兵，在北京接受伟大的领袖毛主席的检阅以后，立即赶回杭州，怀着崇敬的心情，来到蔡永祥生前所在连队表示敬意和慰问。他们把从北京带来的毛主席像纪念章和毛主席接见百万革命师生的照片，赠给连队，还瞻仰了蔡永祥烈士的遗物。当他们看到了蔡永祥在牺牲的前几天买来的两张毛主席像和他亲笔缮写的毛主席语录时，小将们见景生情，回忆起当天蔡永祥舍身抢救列车，用生命保护了他们安全的壮举，个个热泪盈眶，激动地在蔡永祥遗像前举手宣誓。他们说：蔡永祥同志永远活在我们心中，我们要以蔡永祥为榜样，更好地向解放军学习，永当毛泽东时代的革命闯将。
    正在由北向南进行革命串连的旅大市的一批红卫兵，在途中看到蔡永祥事迹的报道以后，万分激动，提前赶到杭州。他们请蔡永祥生前战友和刚入伍的蔡永祥的哥哥蔡永胜，详细介绍了烈士生前活学活用毛主席著作的事迹，决心在去革命圣地延安进行革命串连的实际行动中，以英雄为榜样，学习解放军的三八作风，不怕苦，不怕累，克服困难，步行到达目的地，把自己锻炼成为解放军的坚强后备军。为了表示他们学习解放军的决心，他们用了两天时间，冒雨外出，拣来白瓷片，在蔡永祥生前所在连队的驻地，铺砌了“蔡永祥同志永垂不朽”九个大字。
    曾经到刘英俊生前所在连队访问学习过的黑龙江省佳木斯的十六名红卫兵和革命学生，闻讯后也赶到杭州，把刘英俊生前战友送给他们的刘英俊照片，装在镜框里，写上毛主席语录：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”，送给蔡永祥生前所在连队。蔡永祥烈士的战友们，向他们赠送了蔡永祥遗像。他们激动地说：“这张珍贵的照片，将像刘英俊的照片一样，鼓舞着我们更好地向解放军学习，永远跟着毛主席干革命。我们坚决遵循毛主席的教导，从这里开始，徒步到各地进行革命串连，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
    浙江大学的红卫兵和革命学生组成的长征队，高举着红旗，迈着整齐的步伐，走过钱塘江大桥，在蔡永祥献身的地方，散发了长征宣言书。宣言书上写道：我们决心接过蔡永祥的枪，高举烈士鲜血染红的旗帜，踏着英雄的足迹前进！我们要用自己的行动向全世界庄严宣告，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国青年，天不怕、地不怕、苦不怕、死不怕，我们要砸烂旧世界，创造一个毛泽东思想光辉照耀的通红通红的新世界！
    一队又一队的红卫兵，从这里吸取了新的精神力量，踏上了革命串连的征途。很多人在出发前留下了充满革命豪情的诗句。他们写道：
    英雄蔡永祥，舍身救小将，
    事迹万古传，人人记心上。
    钱塘江上红旗飘，红卫兵不怕征途遥，
    想起英雄蔡永祥，浑身干劲比天高。

    据新华社合肥十八日电　一心为公的共产主义战士蔡永祥为抢救运送红卫兵的专车而壮烈牺牲的消息，传到他的家乡——安徽省肥东县湖滨公社以后，社员们和学校师生们立即掀起学习英雄蔡永祥的活动。
    蔡永祥的家在湖光大队大蔡村，全村社员在得知蔡永祥壮烈牺牲消息的当天，就涌到烈士家里，向烈士的父母慰问。他们说：
  “蔡永祥在危急关头抢救了无产阶级文化大革命中的小将红卫兵，保住了钱塘江大桥，他真是毛主席的好战士。他死得比泰山还重！这是我们全公社贫下中农的光荣！”蔡永祥生前当过班长的基干民兵班的民兵们，纷纷写决心书，坚决表示要学习蔡永祥一心为公，敢于牺牲的精神，做一个蔡永祥式的共产主义战士。全村民兵受到蔡永祥高尚风格的影响，遇事想到“公”字，热爱集体，关心他人，许多人做了好事，都不留姓名。
    蔡永祥为抢救红卫兵专车而光荣牺牲的英雄事迹，在烈士家乡巢湖中学革命师生中引起巨大的震动。他们结队来到烈士家中，把从北京带来的毛主席石膏像，新从上海带来的毛主席语录牌和整套的《毛泽东选集》，赠给烈士家属。蔡永祥读过书的肆顶山小学，听到他英勇牺牲的消息以后更是激动，立即开展了学习蔡永祥的活动。
    最近湖滨公社的虹光、迎霞、湖滨、湖光、黑石、跃进六个大队，联合召开了有五千多人参加的学习毛主席著作讲用会。会上，学习毛主席著作积极分子都以蔡永祥作为学习的范例，决心学一辈子，用一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想。
