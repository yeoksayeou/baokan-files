Vientiane, November 13 (Xinhua) – Recent reports from Vientiane indicate that the Laotian regime in Vientiane has been actively following the U.S. imperialist plot to create "two Chinas." They support and tolerate KMT elements in Vientiane, while simultaneously engaging in extensive anti-China propaganda in their publications.

Since May of this year, the Vientiane regime has repeatedly sent pseudo-parliamentary delegations to Taiwan. In mid-September, the vice-chairman of the Laotian pseudo-parliament, Khamphai Apai, also traveled to Taiwan. The right-wing official publication of Vientiane, "Lao News," even published news of KMT elements' activities in Taiwan. The Laotian national radio station also propagandized for the KMT, conspiring to create "two Chinas." The Vientiane regime also allowed KMT elements to hold a pseudo-national day reception in Vientiane, with numerous Vientiane "government" ministers and police chiefs attending the reception.

While intensifying their collusion with KMT elements and conspiring to create "two Chinas," Laotian official publications and media have been publishing a large number of anti-China articles, conducting extensive anti-China propaganda. Recently, they have been continuously slandering China's Cultural Revolution, even spreading the absurd claim that the September floods in Laos were caused by China's nuclear tests.

The Chinese Embassy in Vientiane has lodged a strong protest with the Vientiane regime regarding the aforementioned anti-China activities.

    追随美帝　勾结蒋帮　加紧反华
    万象当局阴谋制造“两个中国”
    我驻万象大使馆向万象当局严正抗议
    新华社十三日讯　万象消息：老挝万象当局最近积极追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，支持和纵容蒋帮分子在万象进行活动，同时在报刊上大肆进行反华宣传。
    万象当局从今年五月以来，不断派伪议员代表团到台湾活动，老挝伪议会副主席坎派·阿沛在九月中旬也到台湾活动。万象右派官方刊物《老挝新闻》竟然刊登蒋帮分子在台湾活动的消息，老挝国家广播电台也为蒋帮进行宣传，制造“两个中国”的阴谋。万象当局还纵容蒋帮分子在万象举行伪国庆招待会，万象“政府”大臣和军警头目等多人出席了这个招待会。
    在加紧与蒋帮分子勾结并制造“两个中国”的阴谋的同时，老挝官方报刊舆论大量刊登反华文章进行反华宣传，如最近不断对中国文化大革命进行诬蔑，甚至大肆散布所谓老挝九月洪水泛滥是由于中国核试验所造成等荒唐的滥调。
    中国驻万象大使馆已就上述反华活动向万象当局提出了严正的抗议。
