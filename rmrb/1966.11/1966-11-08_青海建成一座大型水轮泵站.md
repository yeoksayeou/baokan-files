Qinghai Province's Datong County, in the Houzihe area, has recently completed the province's first large-scale, high-lift, high-flow water turbine pumping station. This has transformed over 10,000 mu of dry land in the foothills into irrigated fields.

In recent years, the various ethnic communities in Qinghai have taken advantage of the province's rugged terrain, abundant water resources, and significant elevation drops in irrigation channels. They have built over 260 small-scale electric irrigation stations and water turbine pumping stations, expanding the irrigated area by over 90,000 mu.

    青海建成一座大型水轮泵站
    青海省大通县后子河地区各族社员，最近建成全省第一座高扬程、大流量的水轮泵站，使一万多亩低山旱地变成水浇田。
    近年来，青海各族社员，利用青海沟壑纵横，水源丰富，渠道落差大的特点，已建成小型电灌站、水轮泵站等二百六十多处，扩大灌溉面积九万多亩。
