The wheel of history rolls forward.

The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution rolls forward.

On November 10, the East-West Avenue across Tiananmen Square was filled with a continuous stream of cars. Six thousand vehicles, packed with revolutionary students and Red Guards, once again received Chairman Mao's inspection.

On November 11, this avenue was filled with a sea of people. Chairman Mao again inspected over 1.5 million cultural revolutionaries.

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao has now received revolutionary youngsters from all over the country for the seventh time.

Chairman Mao's repeated receptions have allowed millions of revolutionary youngsters to see the reddest sun in their hearts. Chairman Mao's repeated receptions have each time been the greatest encouragement to hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao's repeated receptions have pushed the Cultural Revolution to new heights, wave after wave.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is like a sudden storm, sweeping across the land of China.

Billions of people have been mobilized. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters in society have been dragged out into the open. Revolutionary people are proud and confident, while the reactionary bourgeoisie are disgraced.

Brave Red Guards have emerged. They have left their schools and taken to the streets, breaking the old and establishing the new. They have taken up iron brooms to sweep away the filth and remnants of the old society. Many bloodsuckers and parasites have been exposed, and many treasures and accounts of rebellion have been displayed. The Red Guards have become the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a gentle spring rain, is transforming the face of Chinese society and the spiritual outlook of the people.

Every household hangs a portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, and everywhere is a sea of red with the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." More and more people are studying Chairman Mao's works, and more and more people are taking the "Three Articles" as their guiding principles. The entire nation is becoming a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is becoming more widespread and deeply rooted in people's hearts, becoming the unified ideology of the entire nation.

The revolutionary young generation, in the Cultural Revolution and in the storms of class struggle, has tempered itself in wind and rain, gaining experience and becoming red revolutionary successors.

China's unprecedented Cultural Revolution, like lightning and thunder, has shaken the world.

All revolutionary people enthusiastically cheer for China's Cultural Revolution, saying, "It's excellent!"

This Cultural Revolution has stirred and inspired the oppressed and exploited people of various countries. They enthusiastically praise: "This is the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, a new development of Marxism-Leninism," "It is a great revolution of world-historical significance related to the people of the entire world."

A Latin American friend recently visiting China said: "Without China, without this Cultural Revolution, humanity might face several hundred years of reactionary rule. No country has successfully adapted the superstructure of socialism to the economic base of socialism; without this, they would return to capitalism. But now I have seen China's Cultural Revolution and its Red Guards, and I know that a quarter of humanity is marching forward."

An Asian trade union leader said: China's Cultural Revolution "is epoch-making, and it will take centuries to fully understand its influence."

However, imperialism, modern revisionism, and their various followers curse China's Cultural Revolution, saying, "It's terrible!"

From Washington to Moscow, from New Delhi to the Vatican, various reactionaries, like facing the end of the world, nervously watch China. They curse China's Cultural Revolution as "a real threat to the world." They cry out that China's Red Guards are "the most disturbing."

The thunder of China's Cultural Revolution, the war drums of the Red Guards, and the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought have frightened all the ghosts and monsters in the world, making them dizzy and confused.

Why are these ghosts and monsters so afraid of China's Cultural Revolution? A Swedish high school teacher said it best: "The American ruling class has long hoped that China's third generation would betray the cause. But now, it is precisely China's third generation that has joined the Red Guards, and the American hope is dashed. The hopes of all anti-China heroes have also been dashed!"

The wheel of history rolls forward.

The torrent of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution rolls forward.

Anyone who dares to obstruct the forward march of the wheel of history, anyone who dares to obstruct the forward surge of the revolutionary torrent, will be crushed by the wheel and drowned by the torrent.

The Great Commander, the Most Brilliant Example

Our beloved Chairman Mao is the supreme commander of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that has shaken the world.

Chairman Mao! It is with great courage and the greatest resolve that you have initiated a massive mass movement to carry out this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only a great Marxist-Leninist like you, only a great genius like you, dares to initiate this magnificent and world-shaking revolutionary mass movement. You are the greatest proletarian revolutionary. You are always with the masses, fully trusting the masses, sharing their breath and fate, wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary mass movement. You have set the most brilliant example for all Party comrades and for the younger generation.

"From a single spark, a prairie fire may burst into flame."

On May 25, seven comrades from Peking University, including Nie Yuanzi, posted the first revolutionary big-character poster, immediately receiving Chairman Mao's strong support. It spread like a seagull before a storm, and the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution quickly and fiercely burned across the nation.

In the days of stormy waves and changing class struggles, how people longed to see the red lamp of Zhongnanhai and to hear Chairman Mao's voice!

At this critical moment, the Party Central Committee issued the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, making a decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This decision is a new development of Marxism-Leninism, a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great program for a new stage of socialist revolution in our country, a lighthouse illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a battle cry to destroy the old world, and a mobilization order to build a new world!

The good news resounded like spring thunder across the nation. From cities to villages, from the Tumen River to the South China Sea, from the front lines of the East China Sea to the Pamir border, everywhere was a festive atmosphere. People of all ethnic groups sang and danced in celebration of the Party's brilliant victory.

The revolutionary masses of the capital were even more ecstatic. They beat drums and gongs, day and night, rushing to the reception station of the Communist Party of China to report the good news.

"Chairman Mao has come! Chairman Mao has come!"

On August 10, this unforgettable day, will forever shine in the memory of the capital's people. That evening at 7:15, our beloved Chairman Mao, smiling, came to the reception station, came to the people. Ten thousand people cheered and jumped with joy.

Chairman Mao walked onto the platform amidst the cheers and said to everyone:

"You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

The people of the entire nation enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call. The unprecedented storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered a new high tide.

The flames of revolution burned across the nation.

Daring revolutionaries and rebels, the Red Guards, were born in the flames of revolution.

Our great leader immediately seized this great trend, this new thing full of boundless vitality, enthusiastically supporting it, nurturing it, promoting it, making it take root, grow strong, and bloom across the land of the motherland!

Our great commander, on August 18, at Tiananmen, inspected a million revolutionary youngsters from Beijing and all over the country, the cultural revolutionary army, for the first time. He happily told the Red Guards of Tsinghua University Middle School:

"I firmly support you!"

That day, the Red Guards gave the great commander a red armband. The youngsters excitedly spread the news:

"Chairman Mao has joined our Red Guards!"

"Chairman Mao is the red commander, and we are Chairman Mao's red soldiers!"

At that moment, how many hearts burned with excitement, how many eyes shone with tears of emotion. Chairman Mao, your warm smile contains boundless trust and expectation for us. Your earnest teachings have given us the greatest encouragement and strength. Chairman Mao, we will definitely always follow your words and go into the storms of revolution as revolutionary pioneers!

The parade, like the surging Yangtze River, flowed past Chairman Mao, past Tiananmen Square. Ten thousand people looked up, ten thousand people bathed in the light of happiness, ten thousand red hearts turned to the sun, ten thousand people cheered and sang.

Looking at the revolutionary masses before him, full of passion, Chairman Mao said to his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao:

"This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological revolution of the people of the entire nation."

The great leader's high evaluation of the revolutionary mass movement is a great encouragement and support for the revolutionary masses, powerfully promoting the Cultural Revolution to develop more broadly and deeply.

Chairman Mao most believes in the masses, most relies on the masses, and practices what he preaches. He is the most brilliant example. This time, on the Tiananmen City Tower, he also kindly told some responsible comrades participating in the reception meeting:

"You must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better."

The great commander's repeated receptions of the revolutionary masses are direct education and mobilization for the broad revolutionary masses. Each reception brings a new high tide to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Some say that Tiananmen Square has now become a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. When people see Chairman Mao's healthy body and kind smile, when people read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together, when people hear the speeches of Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai, when people take the revolutionary sparks and revolutionary experiences back to the entire nation, what immense spiritual and material strength will be generated!

A youngster from the grasslands of the Khorchin Right Front Banner, Inner Mongolia, named Shagder, said: "Chairman Mao understands us the most, cares for us the most, and supports us the most. Chairman Mao has received us seven times, which is the greatest encouragement for us. I will not disappoint Chairman Mao's hopes. I will definitely follow the victorious path indicated by Chairman Mao, like an eagle in the sky, like a steed on the grasslands, and plunge into the storm of the Cultural Revolution!"

Chairman Mao's line is the line of victory.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is like a lighthouse on the sea, illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary pioneers who have received Chairman Mao's repeated inspections, tempered by the flames of revolution, feel even more intimately that doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought!

Every time there is an inspection, the revolutionary pioneers come with joy and love for Mao Zedong Thought, respecting it deeply. On Tiananmen Square, on the viewing platform, in the parade, in the inspected cars, and on both sides of the red avenue inspecting the cultural revolutionary army, countless revolutionary pioneers enthusiastically cheer for the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Just as the flames of the Cultural Revolution were forming a prairie fire, those who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line were terrified. They went against the current, directing the struggle against the revolutionary masses. Some revolutionary masses were suppressed.

Our great leader Chairman Mao promptly corrected the wrong line. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, convened and presided over by Chairman Mao, proclaimed the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the guidance and inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary pioneers who were fighting a tough battle against the bourgeois reactionary line at that time, stood up straight, raised their chests, and launched a mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line. The arrogance of the bourgeois reactionary line was brought down, and the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution burned even more fiercely.

The revolutionary pioneers, with boundless love, sang: Our great leader Chairman Mao has always represented the correct line. Chairman Mao's line, past, present, and future, is and will forever be an invincible line!

On November 11, a representative of middle school students from Wenjiamarket, Liuyang County, Hunan, accepted Chairman Mao's inspection on Xichang'an Street. They brought a banner embroidered with "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" and chestnuts from the tree planted by Chairman Mao, presenting them to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Wenjiamarket is the starting point of Chairman Mao's leadership of the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops marching to Jinggangshan. At that time, after the failure of the first domestic revolutionary war, the "left" opportunist line within the Party seriously threatened the future of the Chinese revolution. At this critical juncture, it was Chairman Mao who led the famous Autumn Harvest Uprising and led the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops to Jinggangshan, establishing the first rural revolutionary base area and opening the path to victory for the Chinese revolution.

The revolutionary youngsters from Wenjiamarket often pass by the place where Chairman Mao spoke to the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops in those days and are familiar with the story of Chairman Mao saving the Chinese revolution. Today, they saw Chairman Mao in the capital, saw Chairman Mao waving to them from an open car, and excitedly said: Our Chairman Mao always points the way for the Chinese revolution at critical moments. In this Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has again promptly corrected the bourgeois reactionary line, promoting the healthy development of the Cultural Revolution. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution and forever defend and uphold Chairman Mao's correct line!

On November 10, representatives of middle school students from Zunyi stood on the viewing platform of Tiananmen and saw Chairman Mao. They looked at the endless, majestic car procession on the square and joyfully said: Chairman Mao's leadership of the Zunyi Conference successfully ended the rule of various wrong lines in the Party Central Committee. From then on, the Chinese revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, moved from victory to victory. This is our greatest happiness!

Revolutionary youngsters from all over the country cited countless facts, proving a truth: At every critical moment of the revolution, it is our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao who comes to correct the course, point the direction, and leads us to sail against the wind and waves, hoist the sails, and reach the shore of victory!

The several million cultural revolutionary troops who have been received by Chairman Mao have a common belief: Chairman Mao's line is the line of victory. As long as we use Mao Zedong Thought to further purge the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line and correctly, completely, and thoroughly carry out Chairman Mao's line, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be carried through to the end in victory!

Long live Chairman Mao! Long live comrades!

Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, at 3:03 PM on November 10, stood in front of the loudspeaker on the Tiananmen City Tower and shouted:

"Long live comrades!"

This resounding, warm voice, like spring thunder, echoed across the motherland, warming the hearts of 700 million people.

Instantly, cheers like tidal waves surged higher and higher.

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!"

This is the voice of the young generation. This loud voice is full of boundless love for the great leader and expresses unparalleled loyalty to the great commander!

This voice, from Tiananmen Square, crossed the Great Wall, crossed the Yangtze River, and merged with the cheers of the people of the entire nation, forming a powerful wave, flying in all directions.

Looking at this red youth generation, looking at the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution army marching forward, Chairman Mao smiled.

Our successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause have grown up. They have been tempered in the great storms of the three great revolutionary movements. The cause of the Chinese revolution will be even more prosperous, and the victory of the world revolution has hope.

Our revolutionary youth, our Red Guard warriors, were born under the red flag and grew up under the red flag. Mao Zedong Thought has given them red souls. Most of them are teenagers under 17 years old, growing up with New China. The first song they learned to sing was "The East Is Red," the first sentence they learned to write was "Long live Chairman Mao!" The first truth they understood was: Mao Zedong Thought is victory.

The new generation of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is the most selfless, the most intelligent, the bravest, and the strongest.

On the viewing platform on the east side of Tiananmen, there is a worker's daughter named Liu Aihua, a middle school student from Hunchun City, Jilin. On the morning of July 28 this year, she risked her life to save a child playing on the railway tracks just as a speeding train was approaching. The train stopped urgently, and the dispatcher comrade asked her with admiration, "Who gave you such great courage?" Liu Aihua proudly replied, "It's Chairman Mao!" Her mother asked her, "Aren't you afraid?" She said, "People will die, but death can be as heavy as Mount Tai or as light as a feather!"

Jia Huilan from Dazhai Agricultural Middle School is the daughter of Jia Jincai, the director of the poor peasants' association of Dazhai Brigade. She stared at Tiananmen, waving and cheering to Chairman Mao. She brought greetings from the Dazhai youth to Chairman Mao. This daughter of a poor peasant is firm in her class stance and clear in her hatred and love. Last autumn, she bravely confronted a rich peasant element face to face. Someone said she did not respect the elderly. She said proudly, "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of revolution. What courtesy can there be with the enemy?"

In this Cultural Revolution, revolutionary young people are the eagles charging into the ranks of all ghosts and monsters.

"We will overthrow anyone, no matter how high their position or how old their credentials, as long as they are against the Party and socialism. We will rebel against them!"

"Whoever loves Mao Zedong Thought, we will be close to them; whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight them!"

Our young generation is fearless, noble, and steadfast!

Chairman Mao said: "The world belongs to you, to us, but in the end, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor, in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you." Today, the revolutionary youth, with excited hearts, sing songs composed with these words, over and over again. This magnificent song expresses the great leader Chairman Mao's boundless hopes and trust in the youth, and also embodies the young generation's firm belief in following Chairman Mao to make revolution for life.

Under Chairman Mao's loving care and in the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, the red youth generation has grown up. Stars gather around the North Star, sunflowers all turn to the sun, the hearts of revolutionary youth forever turn to our great leader Chairman Mao!

    毛主席永远和群众在一起
          震撼世界的风暴
    历史的车轮滚滚向前。
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前。
    十一月十日，横穿天安门广场的东西大道上，车如流水，六千辆汽车满载着革命师生和红卫兵，又一次接受毛主席的检阅。
    十一日，这条大道上，人如海潮，毛主席又乘车检阅了一百五十多万文化革命大军。
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，已经是第七次接见了来自全国各地的革命小将。
    毛主席一次又一次的接见，使几百万革命小将都看到了自己心中最红最红的红太阳。毛主席一次又一次的接见，每一次都是对亿万革命群众的最大鼓舞。毛主席一次又一次的接见，把文化大革命一浪又一浪地推向新的高潮。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，有如急风骤雨，正在涤荡着中国的大地。
    亿万人民群众被发动起来了。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，社会上的牛鬼蛇神，一个个地被揪到光天化日之下。革命人民扬眉吐气，反动资产阶级威风扫地。
    英勇的红卫兵出现了。他们从学校走上街头，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新。他们拿起铁扫帚，横扫旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水、残渣余孽。许多吸血鬼、寄生虫都被搞得狼狈不堪，许多金银财宝、变天账被拿出来展览。红卫兵成了文化大革命中的急先锋。
    无产阶级文化大革命，有如春风化雨，正在改变着中国社会的面貌和人的精神面貌。
    家家挂起伟大的领袖毛主席的像，处处是《毛主席语录》的红色海洋。越来越多的人大学毛主席著作，越来越多的人把“老三篇”作为“座右铭”。全国正在成为毛泽东思想的大学校。毛泽东思想更加普及，更加深入人心，正在成为全国人民统一的思想。
    革命的年青一代，在文化大革命中，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，经风雨，见世面，把自己锻炼成为红色的革命接班人。
    中国史无前例的文化大革命，有如电闪雷鸣，震撼世界。
    一切革命的人民，都热烈欢呼中国文化大革命“好得很”。
    这场文化大革命，激动着、鼓舞着各国被压迫、被剥削的人民。他们热烈赞扬：“这是毛泽东思想的光辉，是马克思列宁主义的新发展”，“是关系到全世界人民的、具有世界历史意义的大革命”。
    一位最近在中国访问的拉丁美洲朋友说：“没有中国，没有这次的文化革命，人类可能会面临几百年的反革命统治的黑夜。没有一个国家曾成功地使社会主义的上层建筑适应于社会主义的经济基础；做不到这一点，他们就又退回到资本主义。但是，现在我看到了中国的文化革命和它的红卫兵，我知道人类的四分之一是在迈步前进。”
    一位亚洲的工会领导人说：中国文化大革命“是具有划时代意义的，需要几个世纪才能充分认识到它的影响。”
    然而，帝国主义、现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者，咒骂中国文化大革命“糟得很”。
    从华盛顿到莫斯科，从新德里到梵蒂冈，各种各样的反动派，像面临着末日似的，提心吊胆地注视着中国。他们咒骂中国文化大革命“是威胁着世界的真正危险”。他们惊呼中国的红卫兵“最令人不安”。
    中国文化大革命的雷鸣，中国红卫兵的战鼓，毛泽东思想的不可战胜的力量，把世界上形形色色的牛鬼蛇神吓得晕头转向。
    这些牛鬼蛇神为什么对中国文化大革命如此害怕？瑞典的一位中学女教师一语道破：“美国统治集团多少年来一直希望中国的第三代出现变节。但是，现在正是中国的第三代参加了红卫兵，美国的希望完蛋了。”一切反华的英雄好汉们的希望也都完蛋了！
    历史的车轮滚滚向前。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前。
    任何妄想阻挡历史车轮前进的人，任何妄想阻挡革命洪流前进的人，都将被这车轮辗碎，被这洪流淹没。
    伟大的统帅　最光辉的榜样
    我们最敬爱的毛主席，是震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命的最高统帅。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您以巨大的魄力、最大的决心，发动大规模的群众运动，来进行这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。只有您这样伟大的马克思列宁主义者，只有您这样伟大的天才，才敢于发动这场轰轰烈烈、震撼全国和全世界的革命群众运动。您是最伟大的无产阶级革命家。您总是和群众在一起，充分地信任群众，和群众同呼吸，共命运，全心全意支持革命的群众运动，您给全党同志、给青年一代，树立了最光辉的榜样。
      “星星之火，可以燎原。”
    五月二十五日，北京大学聂元梓等七同志贴出了第一张革命的大字报，立刻得到毛主席的极力支持。它像暴风雨前的海燕飞遍全国，无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，迅速猛烈地燃烧起来。
    在大浪滔天的日子里，在风云多变的阶级斗争中，人们多么渴望见到中南海的红灯，多么期望听到毛主席的声音呵。
    就在这个时候，党中央发布了八届十一中全会的公报，作出了关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定。这个决定是马克思列宁主义的新发展，是毛泽东思想的新胜利，是我国社会主义革命新阶段的伟大纲领，是照亮无产阶级文化大革命道路的灯塔，是摧毁旧世界的进军号，是建设新世界的动员令！
    喜讯像春雷震荡全国。从城市到乡村，从图们江到南海边，从东海前哨到帕米尔边防，到处一片欢腾。各族革命人民载歌载舞游行，庆祝党的光辉的胜利。
    首都的革命群众，更是狂欢不已。他们敲锣打鼓，日夜不绝地奔向中共中央群众接待站去报喜。
    “毛主席来了，毛主席来了！”
    八月十日，这个难忘的日子，永远闪烁在首都人民的记忆里。这天下午七时十五分，我们敬爱的毛主席，满面笑容，来到接待站，来到群众中。千万人欢呼着，跳跃着。
    毛主席在欢呼中走上讲台，对大家说：
    “你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    全国人民热烈响应毛主席发出的伟大号召。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，进入新的高潮。
    革命的烈火，在全国燃烧。
    敢于革命造反的红卫兵，在革命烈火中诞生了。
    我们伟大的领袖，立刻抓住冒出地平线的这一伟大苗头，这一具有无限生命力的新事物，热情地支持它，哺育它，推广它，使它在祖国的大地上，生根、壮大、开花！
    我们的伟大统帅，八月十八日，在天安门接见北京和来自全国各地的百万革命小将，首次检阅文化革命大军时，高兴地对清华大学附中的红卫兵说：
    “我坚决支持你们！”
    这天，红卫兵给伟大统帅戴上了红袖章。小将们激动地奔走相告：
    “毛主席参加了我们的红卫兵！”
    “毛主席是红司令，我们是毛主席的红小兵！”
    这时，多少颗火热的心在激烈跳动，多少双眼睛闪着感动的泪花。毛主席呵，毛主席，您亲切的微笑，包含着对我们的无限信任和期待，您的谆谆教导，给了我们最大的鼓舞和力量。毛主席呵，我们一定要永远听您的话，到大风大浪里去当革命的闯将！
    游行的队伍，像奔腾的长江，浩浩荡荡，走过毛主席面前，走过天安门广场。千万人抬头仰望，千万人沐浴着幸福的目光，千万颗红心向太阳，千万人欢呼歌唱。
    望着眼前充满豪情的革命群众，毛主席对他的亲密战友林彪同志说：
    “这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”
    伟大领袖对革命群众运动的高度评价，是对革命群众极大的鼓舞和支持，有力地推动了文化大革命更广阔深入地发展。
    毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众，身体力行，他是最光辉的榜样。这一次，他在天安门城楼上，还亲切地对参加接见大会的一些负责同志说：
      “你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    伟大统帅一次又一次接见革命群众，是对广大革命群众的直接教育和发动。每接见一次，无产阶级文化大革命就出现了新的高潮。
    有人说，天安门广场，现在变成了毛泽东思想的大学校。当人们看到毛主席健康的身体，慈祥的笑容，当人们齐声朗读《毛主席语录》，当人们听到林彪同志、周恩来同志的讲话，当人们把革命火种、革命经验带到全国去的时候，将会产生多么巨大的精神力量和物质力量啊！
    来自内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟科右前旗草原上的小将沙格德尔说：“毛主席最了解我们，最关心我们，最支持我们。毛主席七次接见我们，是对我们的最大鼓舞。我决不辜负毛主席的希望，我一定照着毛主席指引的胜利方向，像高空中的雄鹰，像草原上的骏马，投入到文化大革命的风暴中去！”
    毛主席的路线是胜利的路线
    伟大的毛泽东思想犹如大海上的灯塔，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的航道。
    接受毛主席历次检阅的革命闯将们，经过革命烈火的锤炼，他们更加亲切地感到，干革命靠的就是毛泽东思想！
    每逢接见的日子，革命闯将们都带着胜利的喜悦，怀着对毛泽东思想的无限热爱、无限崇敬的心情，来见自己的伟大统帅。在天安门广场，在观礼台上，在游行队伍当中，在受检阅的汽车上，在检阅文化革命大军的红色大道两旁，许许多多革命闯将都在热情地欢呼毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利。
    就在文化大革命的烈火正在形成燎原之势的时候，那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的人吓破了胆，他们倒行逆施，把斗争的矛头指向革命群众。一些革命群众受到了打击。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席及时纠正了错误路线。毛主席亲自主持召开的党的八届十一中全会，宣告了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产。在毛泽东思想的指引、鼓舞下，正在同资产阶级反动路线进行艰苦斗争的革命闯将们，这时候，伸直了腰杆，挺起了胸膛，向资产阶级反动路线展开了群众性的批判。资产阶级反动路线的威风被打下去了，无产阶级文化大革命的烈火燃烧得更猛更旺。
    革命闯将们怀着无限爱戴之情歌颂道：我们的伟大领袖毛主席历来都代表着正确的路线。毛主席的路线，过去是，现在是，将来也永远是战无不胜的路线！
    湖南浏阳县文家市的中学生代表，十一月十一日在西长安街，接受了毛主席的检阅。他们受当地贫下中农的委托，带来了绣着“祝福毛主席万寿无疆！”的锦旗，带来了毛主席亲手栽的板栗树上结的栗子，献给伟大领袖毛主席。
    文家市，是毛主席领导秋收起义部队向井冈山进军的起点。当时，在第一次国内革命战争失败之后，党内的“左”倾盲动主义路线，严重威胁着中国革命的前途。在这危急的关头，是毛主席领导了著名的秋收起义，并且领导秋收起义部队走上井冈山，创立了第一个农村革命根据地，为中国革命开辟了胜利的道路。
    文家市来的革命小将们，经常经过当年毛主席给秋收起义部队讲话的地方，都熟悉当年毛主席挽救中国革命的故事。今天，他们在首都见到了毛主席，看到毛主席在敞篷汽车上亲切地向他们招手，他们兴奋地说：我们的毛主席总是在紧要关头，为中国革命指明方向。在这次文化大革命中，毛主席又及时纠正了资产阶级反动路线，推动了文化大革命的健康发展。我们要永远跟着毛主席闹革命，永远执行和捍卫毛主席的正确路线！
    十一月十日，遵义的中学生代表在天安门观礼台上见到了毛主席。他们望着行驶在广场上的连绵不断的雄壮的车队，兴高采烈地说：毛主席领导的遵义会议，胜利结束了各种错误路线在党中央的统治。从此，中国革命在毛主席正确路线的指引下，从胜利走向胜利。这是我们最大的幸福！
    来自五湖四海的革命小将们，举出了许许多多的事实，这些事实证明着一个真理：在每一个革命的关键时刻，都是我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席，他老人家来拨正船头，指明航向，带领我们乘风破浪，扬帆远航，直达胜利的彼岸！
    先后受到毛主席接见的几百万文化革命大军，有一个共同的信念：毛主席的路线就是胜利的路线。只要用毛泽东思想去进一步肃清资产阶级反动路线的影响，正确地、完全地、彻底地执行毛主席的路线，无产阶级文化大革命就能胜利进行到底！
    毛主席万岁！同志们万岁！
    我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席，十一月十日下午三时零三分，在天安门城楼上，走到扩音器前高呼：
    “同志们万岁！”
    这宏亮、亲切的声音，像春雷，回响在祖国上空，温暖着七亿人民的心。
    顿时，欢呼声有如海潮，一浪高过一浪。
    “毛主席万岁！”
    “毛主席万岁！”
    “毛主席万万岁！”
    这是年青一代发出的声音。这响亮的声音，充满了对伟大领袖的无限热爱，表达了对伟大统帅的无比忠诚！
    这声音从天安门广场越过长城，跨过长江，同全国人民的欢呼汇成强大的声浪，飞向四面八方。
    望着这红色的青年一代，望着这浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军向前挺进，毛主席笑了。
    我们的无产阶级革命事业的接班人成长起来了，他们在三大革命运动的大风大浪中锻炼成长。中国的革命事业会更加兴旺，世界革命的胜利有了指望。
    我们的革命青年，我们的红卫兵战士，在红旗下生，在红旗下长，毛泽东思想给了他们红色的灵魂。他们多数是十七周岁以下的青少年，同新中国一起成长。他们会唱的第一支歌是《东方红》，他们会写的第一句话是“毛主席万岁！”他们懂得的第一个真理是：毛泽东思想就是胜利。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国青年，最无私，最聪明，最勇敢，最坚强。
    在天安门东侧观礼台上，有一个工人的女儿，她叫刘爱武，是吉林浑江市的一个初中的学生。今年七月二十八日上午，她冒着生命危险，当飞快的火车临近的一刹那，当机立断地抢救了一个在铁路上玩耍的儿童。火车紧急刹住，调度员同志以钦佩的心情问她：“谁给你这么大的勇气？”刘爱武响亮地回答：“是毛主席！”她的妈妈问她：“你不怕吗？”她说：“人总是要死的，但死有重于泰山，有轻于鸿毛！”
    来自大寨农业中学的贾惠兰，是大寨大队贫协主任贾进才的女儿。她目不转睛地望着天安门，不断地向毛主席招手，欢呼。她带来了大寨青年对毛主席的问候。这个贫农的女儿，在阶级斗争中立场坚定，爱憎分明。去年麦秋，她勇敢地向一个富农分子展开了面对面的斗争。有人说她不尊重老年人。她理直气壮地说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这是革命的首要问题。对敌人还有什么客气可讲？”
    在这次文化大革命当中，革命青少年是向一切牛鬼蛇神冲锋陷阵的雄鹰。
    “不管你地位多高，资格多老，只要你反党反社会主义，我们就要革你的命，造你的反！”
    “谁热爱毛泽东思想，我们就和他亲；谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就和他拚！”
    我们的青年一代，就是这样无畏，这样高尚，这样坚定！
    毛主席说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”今天，革命青年以激动的心情，唱着用这段话谱写的歌曲，一遍又一遍。这豪迈的歌声，表达了伟大领袖毛主席对青年人的无限期望，无限信任，也体现了青年一代紧跟毛主席闹一辈子革命的坚定信念。
    在毛主席的亲切关怀下，在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，红色的青年一代成长起来了。众星拱卫北斗星，葵花朵朵向太阳，革命青年的心啊，永远向着我们伟大的领袖毛主席！
