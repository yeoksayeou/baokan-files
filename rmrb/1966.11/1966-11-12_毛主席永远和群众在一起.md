The wheel of history rolls forward.

The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution rolls forward.

On November 10, the East-West Avenue across Tiananmen Square was filled with a continuous stream of cars. Six thousand vehicles, packed with revolutionary students and Red Guards, once again received Chairman Mao's inspection.

On November 11, this avenue was filled with a sea of people. Chairman Mao again inspected over 1.5 million cultural revolutionaries.

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao has now received revolutionary youngsters from all over the country for the seventh time.

Chairman Mao's repeated receptions have allowed millions of revolutionary youngsters to see the reddest sun in their hearts. Chairman Mao's repeated receptions have each time been the greatest encouragement to hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao's repeated receptions have pushed the Cultural Revolution to new heights, wave after wave.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is like a sudden storm, sweeping across the land of China.

Billions of people have been mobilized. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters in society have been dragged out into the open. Revolutionary people are proud and confident, while the reactionary bourgeoisie are disgraced.

Brave Red Guards have emerged. They have left their schools and taken to the streets, breaking the old and establishing the new. They have taken up iron brooms to sweep away the filth and remnants of the old society. Many bloodsuckers and parasites have been exposed, and many treasures and accounts of rebellion have been displayed. The Red Guards have become the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a gentle spring rain, is transforming the face of Chinese society and the spiritual outlook of the people.

Every household hangs a portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, and everywhere is a sea of red with the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." More and more people are studying Chairman Mao's works, and more and more people are taking the "Three Articles" as their guiding principles. The entire nation is becoming a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is becoming more widespread and deeply rooted in people's hearts, becoming the unified ideology of the entire nation.

The revolutionary young generation, in the Cultural Revolution and in the storms of class struggle, has tempered itself in wind and rain, gaining experience and becoming red revolutionary successors.

China's unprecedented Cultural Revolution, like lightning and thunder, has shaken the world.

All revolutionary people enthusiastically cheer for China's Cultural Revolution, saying, "It's excellent!"

This Cultural Revolution has stirred and inspired the oppressed and exploited people of various countries. They enthusiastically praise: "This is the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, a new development of Marxism-Leninism," "It is a great revolution of world-historical significance related to the people of the entire world."

A Latin American friend recently visiting China said: "Without China, without this Cultural Revolution, humanity might face several hundred years of reactionary rule. No country has successfully adapted the superstructure of socialism to the economic base of socialism; without this, they would return to capitalism. But now I have seen China's Cultural Revolution and its Red Guards, and I know that a quarter of humanity is marching forward."

An Asian trade union leader said: China's Cultural Revolution "is epoch-making, and it will take centuries to fully understand its influence."

However, imperialism, modern revisionism, and their various followers curse China's Cultural Revolution, saying, "It's terrible!"

From Washington to Moscow, from New Delhi to the Vatican, various reactionaries, like facing the end of the world, nervously watch China. They curse China's Cultural Revolution as "a real threat to the world." They cry out that China's Red Guards are "the most disturbing."

The thunder of China's Cultural Revolution, the war drums of the Red Guards, and the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought have frightened all the ghosts and monsters in the world, making them dizzy and confused.

Why are these ghosts and monsters so afraid of China's Cultural Revolution? A Swedish high school teacher said it best: "The American ruling class has long hoped that China's third generation would betray the cause. But now, it is precisely China's third generation that has joined the Red Guards, and the American hope is dashed. The hopes of all anti-China heroes have also been dashed!"

The wheel of history rolls forward.

The torrent of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution rolls forward.

Anyone who dares to obstruct the forward march of the wheel of history, anyone who dares to obstruct the forward surge of the revolutionary torrent, will be crushed by the wheel and drowned by the torrent.

The Great Commander, the Most Brilliant Example

Our beloved Chairman Mao is the supreme commander of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that has shaken the world.

Chairman Mao! It is with great courage and the greatest resolve that you have initiated a massive mass movement to carry out this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only a great Marxist-Leninist like you, only a great genius like you, dares to initiate this magnificent and world-shaking revolutionary mass movement. You are the greatest proletarian revolutionary. You are always with the masses, fully trusting the masses, sharing their breath and fate, wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary mass movement. You have set the most brilliant example for all Party comrades and for the younger generation.

"From a single spark, a prairie fire may burst into flame."

On May 25, seven comrades from Peking University, including Nie Yuanzi, posted the first revolutionary big-character poster, immediately receiving Chairman Mao's strong support. It spread like a seagull before a storm, and the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution quickly and fiercely burned across the nation.

In the days of stormy waves and changing class struggles, how people longed to see the red lamp of Zhongnanhai and to hear Chairman Mao's voice!

At this critical moment, the Party Central Committee issued the communiqu√© of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, making a decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This decision is a new development of Marxism-Leninism, a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great program for a new stage of socialist revolution in our country, a lighthouse illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a battle cry to destroy the old world, and a mobilization order to build a new world!

The good news resounded like spring thunder across the nation. From cities to villages, from the Tumen River to the South China Sea, from the front lines of the East China Sea to the Pamir border, everywhere was a festive atmosphere. People of all ethnic groups sang and danced in celebration of the Party's brilliant victory.

The revolutionary masses of the capital were even more ecstatic. They beat drums and gongs, day and night, rushing to the reception station of the Communist Party of China to report the good news.

"Chairman Mao has come! Chairman Mao has come!"

On August 10, this unforgettable day, will forever shine in the memory of the capital's people. That evening at 7:15, our beloved Chairman Mao, smiling, came to the reception station, came to the people. Ten thousand people cheered and jumped with joy.

Chairman Mao walked onto the platform amidst the cheers and said to everyone:

"You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

The people of the entire nation enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call. The unprecedented storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered a new high tide.

The flames of revolution burned across the nation.

Daring revolutionaries and rebels, the Red Guards, were born in the flames of revolution.

Our great leader immediately seized this great trend, this new thing full of boundless vitality, enthusiastically supporting it, nurturing it, promoting it, making it take root, grow strong, and bloom across the land of the motherland!

Our great commander, on August 18, at Tiananmen, inspected a million revolutionary youngsters from Beijing and all over the country, the cultural revolutionary army, for the first time. He happily told the Red Guards of Tsinghua University Middle School:

"I firmly support you!"

That day, the Red Guards gave the great commander a red armband. The youngsters excitedly spread the news:

"Chairman Mao has joined our Red Guards!"

"Chairman Mao is the red commander, and we are Chairman Mao's red soldiers!"

At that moment, how many hearts burned with excitement, how many eyes shone with tears of emotion. Chairman Mao, your warm smile contains boundless trust and expectation for us. Your earnest teachings have given us the greatest encouragement and strength. Chairman Mao, we will definitely always follow your words and go into the storms of revolution as revolutionary pioneers!

The parade, like the surging Yangtze River, flowed past Chairman Mao, past Tiananmen Square. Ten thousand people looked up, ten thousand people bathed in the light of happiness, ten thousand red hearts turned to the sun, ten thousand people cheered and sang.

Looking at the revolutionary masses before him, full of passion, Chairman Mao said to his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao:

"This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological revolution of the people of the entire nation."

The great leader's high evaluation of the revolutionary mass movement is a great encouragement and support for the revolutionary masses, powerfully promoting the Cultural Revolution to develop more broadly and deeply.

Chairman Mao most believes in the masses, most relies on the masses, and practices what he preaches. He is the most brilliant example. This time, on the Tiananmen City Tower, he also kindly told some responsible comrades participating in the reception meeting:

"You must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better."

The great commander's repeated receptions of the revolutionary masses are direct education and mobilization for the broad revolutionary masses. Each reception brings a new high tide to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Some say that Tiananmen Square has now become a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. When people see Chairman Mao's healthy body and kind smile, when people read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together, when people hear the speeches of Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai, when people take the revolutionary sparks and revolutionary experiences back to the entire nation, what immense spiritual and material strength will be generated!

A youngster from the grasslands of the Khorchin Right Front Banner, Inner Mongolia, named Shagder, said: "Chairman Mao understands us the most, cares for us the most, and supports us the most. Chairman Mao has received us seven times, which is the greatest encouragement for us. I will not disappoint Chairman Mao's hopes. I will definitely follow the victorious path indicated by Chairman Mao, like an eagle in the sky, like a steed on the grasslands, and plunge into the storm of the Cultural Revolution!"

Chairman Mao's line is the line of victory.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is like a lighthouse on the sea, illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary pioneers who have received Chairman Mao's repeated inspections, tempered by the flames of revolution, feel even more intimately that doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought!

Every time there is an inspection, the revolutionary pioneers come with joy and love for Mao Zedong Thought, respecting it deeply. On Tiananmen Square, on the viewing platform, in the parade, in the inspected cars, and on both sides of the red avenue inspecting the cultural revolutionary army, countless revolutionary pioneers enthusiastically cheer for the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Just as the flames of the Cultural Revolution were forming a prairie fire, those who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line were terrified. They went against the current, directing the struggle against the revolutionary masses. Some revolutionary masses were suppressed.

Our great leader Chairman Mao promptly corrected the wrong line. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, convened and presided over by Chairman Mao, proclaimed the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the guidance and inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary pioneers who were fighting a tough battle against the bourgeois reactionary line at that time, stood up straight, raised their chests, and launched a mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line. The arrogance of the bourgeois reactionary line was brought down, and the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution burned even more fiercely.

The revolutionary pioneers, with boundless love, sang: Our great leader Chairman Mao has always represented the correct line. Chairman Mao's line, past, present, and future, is and will forever be an invincible line!

On November 11, a representative of middle school students from Wenjiamarket, Liuyang County, Hunan, accepted Chairman Mao's inspection on Xichang'an Street. They brought a banner embroidered with "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" and chestnuts from the tree planted by Chairman Mao, presenting them to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Wenjiamarket is the starting point of Chairman Mao's leadership of the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops marching to Jinggangshan. At that time, after the failure of the first domestic revolutionary war, the "left" opportunist line within the Party seriously threatened the future of the Chinese revolution. At this critical juncture, it was Chairman Mao who led the famous Autumn Harvest Uprising and led the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops to Jinggangshan, establishing the first rural revolutionary base area and opening the path to victory for the Chinese revolution.

The revolutionary youngsters from Wenjiamarket often pass by the place where Chairman Mao spoke to the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops in those days and are familiar with the story of Chairman Mao saving the Chinese revolution. Today, they saw Chairman Mao in the capital, saw Chairman Mao waving to them from an open car, and excitedly said: Our Chairman Mao always points the way for the Chinese revolution at critical moments. In this Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has again promptly corrected the bourgeois reactionary line, promoting the healthy development of the Cultural Revolution. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution and forever defend and uphold Chairman Mao's correct line!

On November 10, representatives of middle school students from Zunyi stood on the viewing platform of Tiananmen and saw Chairman Mao. They looked at the endless, majestic car procession on the square and joyfully said: Chairman Mao's leadership of the Zunyi Conference successfully ended the rule of various wrong lines in the Party Central Committee. From then on, the Chinese revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, moved from victory to victory. This is our greatest happiness!

Revolutionary youngsters from all over the country cited countless facts, proving a truth: At every critical moment of the revolution, it is our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao who comes to correct the course, point the direction, and leads us to sail against the wind and waves, hoist the sails, and reach the shore of victory!

The several million cultural revolutionary troops who have been received by Chairman Mao have a common belief: Chairman Mao's line is the line of victory. As long as we use Mao Zedong Thought to further purge the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line and correctly, completely, and thoroughly carry out Chairman Mao's line, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be carried through to the end in victory!

Long live Chairman Mao! Long live comrades!

Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, at 3:03 PM on November 10, stood in front of the loudspeaker on the Tiananmen City Tower and shouted:

"Long live comrades!"

This resounding, warm voice, like spring thunder, echoed across the motherland, warming the hearts of 700 million people.

Instantly, cheers like tidal waves surged higher and higher.

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!"

This is the voice of the young generation. This loud voice is full of boundless love for the great leader and expresses unparalleled loyalty to the great commander!

This voice, from Tiananmen Square, crossed the Great Wall, crossed the Yangtze River, and merged with the cheers of the people of the entire nation, forming a powerful wave, flying in all directions.

Looking at this red youth generation, looking at the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution army marching forward, Chairman Mao smiled.

Our successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause have grown up. They have been tempered in the great storms of the three great revolutionary movements. The cause of the Chinese revolution will be even more prosperous, and the victory of the world revolution has hope.

Our revolutionary youth, our Red Guard warriors, were born under the red flag and grew up under the red flag. Mao Zedong Thought has given them red souls. Most of them are teenagers under 17 years old, growing up with New China. The first song they learned to sing was "The East Is Red," the first sentence they learned to write was "Long live Chairman Mao!" The first truth they understood was: Mao Zedong Thought is victory.

The new generation of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is the most selfless, the most intelligent, the bravest, and the strongest.

On the viewing platform on the east side of Tiananmen, there is a worker's daughter named Liu Aihua, a middle school student from Hunchun City, Jilin. On the morning of July 28 this year, she risked her life to save a child playing on the railway tracks just as a speeding train was approaching. The train stopped urgently, and the dispatcher comrade asked her with admiration, "Who gave you such great courage?" Liu Aihua proudly replied, "It's Chairman Mao!" Her mother asked her, "Aren't you afraid?" She said, "People will die, but death can be as heavy as Mount Tai or as light as a feather!"

Jia Huilan from Dazhai Agricultural Middle School is the daughter of Jia Jincai, the director of the poor peasants' association of Dazhai Brigade. She stared at Tiananmen, waving and cheering to Chairman Mao. She brought greetings from the Dazhai youth to Chairman Mao. This daughter of a poor peasant is firm in her class stance and clear in her hatred and love. Last autumn, she bravely confronted a rich peasant element face to face. Someone said she did not respect the elderly. She said proudly, "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of revolution. What courtesy can there be with the enemy?"

In this Cultural Revolution, revolutionary young people are the eagles charging into the ranks of all ghosts and monsters.

"We will overthrow anyone, no matter how high their position or how old their credentials, as long as they are against the Party and socialism. We will rebel against them!"

"Whoever loves Mao Zedong Thought, we will be close to them; whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight them!"

Our young generation is fearless, noble, and steadfast!

Chairman Mao said: "The world belongs to you, to us, but in the end, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor, in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you." Today, the revolutionary youth, with excited hearts, sing songs composed with these words, over and over again. This magnificent song expresses the great leader Chairman Mao's boundless hopes and trust in the youth, and also embodies the young generation's firm belief in following Chairman Mao to make revolution for life.

Under Chairman Mao's loving care and in the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, the red youth generation has grown up. Stars gather around the North Star, sunflowers all turn to the sun, the hearts of revolutionary youth forever turn to our great leader Chairman Mao!
