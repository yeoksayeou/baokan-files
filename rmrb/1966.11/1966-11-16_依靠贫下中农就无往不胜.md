Title: Relying on Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Leads to Invincibility

Chairman Mao said: "The leadership of the cooperatives must establish the leadership of the existing poor peasants and new lower-middle peasants in the leadership organs, and use the old lower-middle peasants and the new and old upper-middle peasants as auxiliary forces, in order to implement the Party's policy of uniting the poor and middle peasants, consolidating the cooperatives, developing production, and correctly completing the entire rural socialist transformation. Without this condition, the middle peasants and poor peasants cannot be united, the cooperatives cannot be consolidated, production cannot be developed, and the entire rural socialist transformation cannot be realized."

Over the past ten years, the original Wutang Agricultural Cooperative and later the Chunhuashan Commune Wutang Brigade have followed Chairman Mao's instructions to establish and develop the leadership of poor peasants and new lower-middle peasants, firmly uniting the middle peasants, and achieving one victory after another in revolution and construction.

The facts of Wutang Brigade show that poor and lower-middle peasants are the backbone of class struggle in the countryside. The landlord Hu Gengshan seized collective land, incited members to go it alone, and even passed on the "account of changing times" to his children. Such destructive activities were all exposed and struck down by the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, he did not give up and launched a fierce attack in the ideological realm. Starting from 1960, he set up a "black cultural room" in his own home, spreading the reactionary and decadent ideas of the landlord class, attempting to make the youth undergo a "peaceful evolution." During the socialist education movement in 1963, the poor and lower-middle peasants actively exposed Hu Gengshan's new crimes and fought resolutely against him. The Party and Youth League branch also timely conducted class education for the youth and organized them to study Chairman Mao's works. The class consciousness of the broad masses of young people was raised, and they resolved to become successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The facts here also strongly prove that only by establishing the leadership of poor peasants and new lower-middle peasants can the socialist direction be upheld. Wutang Production Team has a large area of wasteland that can be reclaimed. The broad masses of poor peasants advocated collective reclamation, while a few well-off middle peasants advocated private reclamation. They said: "Rely on the collective for food, rely on oneself for money." The poor peasants did not agree, believing that advocating private reclamation would affect collective production and lead to the capitalist road. Under the leadership of the poor peasants, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants united as one, repelled the attack of spontaneous capitalist forces, actively developed wasteland, strengthened the collective economy, and increased the income of all members.

In recent years, the grain crops of the Vanguard Production Team have averaged over 1,000 jin per mu annually, making it the highest-yielding production team in the entire brigade. With increased collective income, the poor and lower-middle peasants advocated retaining more accumulation and building a pig farm. Some well-off middle peasants opposed this, saying: "Money in hand is spent again, there's no point." The broad masses of poor peasants and new lower-middle peasants said with righteous indignation: "Our production team has little land and no dry land. Developing the collective economy relies on farming, raising pigs, and self-reliance. Even if we get less money, we must expand the collective property and develop the collective economy." They think broadly and see far, always considering the country and the collective. The team management committee, based on their opinions, actively developed the collective economy. Now, the Vanguard Production Team's production has developed, the collective assets are becoming more robust, the poor and lower-middle peasants are full of vigor, and the general middle peasants are also convinced.

Wutang Brigade has 49 households of middle peasants, and the brigade's poor peasants pay great attention to uniting them. The Self-Reliance Production Team is a merger of two production teams. When merging, one of the production teams had more middle peasants and stronger labor force, and was unwilling to merge, saying things like "merging will be a loss." The deputy head of the brigade's poor peasants' association, Shi Xin Yun, organized the cadres and members of the two production teams to study the annotations written by Chairman Mao, making everyone recognize the role of poor and lower-middle peasants, and persuading some middle peasants. After the two teams merged, the poor and lower-middle peasants played a revolutionary backbone role, working hard with the middle peasants for a year, achieving a grain crop yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, an increase of over 30% compared to before the merger.

Now, the broad masses of poor peasants in Wutang Brigade have recognized from their own experiences: to thoroughly liberate themselves and make a revolution, they must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They are determined to, on the basis of agricultural collectivization, accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization and accelerate the construction of a new Wutang in socialism.

### 依靠贫下中农就无往不胜

    依靠贫下中农就无往不胜
    毛主席说：“合作社的领导机关必须建立现有贫农和新下中农在领导机关中的优势，而以老下中农和新老两部分上中农作为辅助力量，才能按照党的政策实现贫农和中农的团结，巩固合作社，发展生产，正确地完成整个农村的社会主义改造。没有这个条件，中农和贫农就不能团结，合作社就不能巩固，生产就不能发展，整个农村的社会主义改造就不能实现。”
    十年来，原来的武塘农业社和后来的春华山公社武塘大队，正是按照毛主席的指示，建立和发展贫农和新下中农的领导优势，牢固地团结中农，取得革命和建设的一个又一个胜利的。
    武塘大队的事实表明，贫下中农是农村阶级斗争的中流砥柱。地主胡庚珊侵占集体土地，煽动社员单干，还把“变天账”传交给他的儿女，如此种种破坏活动，都受到贫下中农有力的揭露和打击。但是，他并不死心，又在意识形态领域发动了猖狂进攻。从一九六○年起，他在自己家里开设
  “黑色文化室”，宣扬地主资产阶级的反动腐朽的思想，企图使青年“和平演变”。在一九六三年社会主义教育运动期间，贫下中农又积极起来揭发胡庚珊的这些新罪行，对他进行了坚决斗争。党团支部还及时对青年进行阶级教育，组织他们学习毛主席著作。广大青年阶级觉悟提高了，立志做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    这里的事实还有力地证明，只有树立贫农和新下中农的优势，才能坚持社会主义方向。武塘生产队有大片荒山可以垦殖。广大贫农主张由集体垦殖，少数富裕中农却主张私自垦殖。他们说：“吃饭靠集体，用钱靠自己。”贫农不答应，认为提倡私人垦殖，就会影响集体生产，就会走上资本主义的邪路。在贫农的带头下，广大贫下中农团结一致，打退了资本主义自发势力的进攻，积极开发荒山，壮大集体经济，增加了全体社员的收入。
    近几年来，先锋生产队的粮食作物，年年平均亩产千斤以上，是全大队单产最高的一个生产队。集体收入多了，贫农下中农便主张多留些积累，兴建养猪场。一部分富裕中农反对这样做，他们说：“到了手的钱又把它用掉，没有搞头。”广大贫农和新下中农理直气壮地说：“我们生产队田少，又没旱土，发展集体经济靠种田，靠养猪，更靠自力更生。即使少分一些钱也要扩大集体家当，发展集体经济。”他们想得宽，看得远，处处为国家为集体着想。队管理委员会根据他们的意见，积极发展集体经济。现在，先锋生产队生产发展了，集体家底越来越雄厚，贫下中农意气风发，一般中农也心悦诚服了。
    武塘大队有四十九户中农，队里的贫农十分注意团结他们。自力生产队是由两个生产队合并起来的。在并队的时候，其中一个生产队中农多，劳力强，不愿意合并，说什么“合了队，要吃亏”。大队贫协副主任石新云就组织这两个生产队的干部和社员学习毛主席写的按语，使大家认识到贫下中农的作用，说服了部分中农。两个队合并以后，贫下中农发挥了革命的骨干作用，和中农一起大干了一年，粮食作物亩产量超过一千斤，比并队前增长了三成多。
    现在，武塘大队广大贫农群众从自己的切身经验中认识到：要彻底翻身闹革命，必须读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。他们决心在农业集体化的基础上，加速实现农业机械化，加速建设社会主义的新武塘。
