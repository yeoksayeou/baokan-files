The sun rises in the east, the sky is red all over, the mountains and rivers are joyful and harmonious. Chairman Mao ascends Tiananmen Gate, the mountains are red, the waters are red, and the people are even redder. The red roads and red seas, trains of red guards form a long dragon. Chairman Mao inspects the Red Guards seven times, the Cultural Revolution reaches new heights. Every smiling face is red and glowing, every red heart is beating. Day and night we think of Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao is among the masses. Chairman Mao smiles at us, our hearts surge with passion. "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times long live!" The cheers shake the heavens and the earth. Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand, revolutionary spirit soars like a rainbow. Following the revolutionary path opened by Chairman Mao, we hack through thorns and brambles to be the vanguard. Completely smash the old world, Chairman Mao's teachings are in our hearts. The revolutionary tide never stops, each wave is more powerful than the last.

    革命洪流永不停东方日出满天红，千山万水乐融融，毛主席登上天安门，山红水红人更红。红色的大路红色的海，一列列车队排成龙。毛主席七次检阅红卫兵，文化革命推向新高峰。张张笑脸红彤彤，颗颗红心在跳动。日夜想念毛主席，毛主席就在群众中。毛主席对咱微微笑，心头激情似潮涌。“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”欢呼声震得天地动。毛主席向咱挥巨手，革命豪气贯长虹。沿着毛主席开辟的革命路，披荆斩棘打先锋。彻底打垮旧世界，毛主席教导记心中。革命洪流永不停，一浪更比一浪猛。
