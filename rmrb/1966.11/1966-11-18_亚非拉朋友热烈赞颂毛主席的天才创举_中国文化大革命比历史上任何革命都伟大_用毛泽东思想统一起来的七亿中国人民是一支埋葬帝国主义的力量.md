	Asian, African, and Latin American friends who recently visited China have enthusiastically praised and highly evaluated the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution being carried out by the Chinese people. They pointed out that the Chinese cultural revolution has strengthened the revolutionary resolve of the world's people, inspiring all revolutionary people around the world to fight against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. This cultural revolution is greater than any revolution in history and will greatly accelerate the historical process of world revolution.

	The head of the 13th delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association, Fuzhu Li Meishi, said: "After the proletariat seizes power and changes the system of ownership, it must also carry out a revolution in ideology. After the Soviet Union seized power and laid the foundations of socialism, it did not carry out a revolution in thought, and thus modern revisionism appeared, causing the Soviet Union to regress towards capitalism. The proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao is to solve the problem of preventing revisionism in socialist countries, ensuring that China will never change color. This has great significance for the world revolution." Fuzhu Li Meishi said: "The cultural revolution is being carried out under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The cultural revolution is to eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology. The core of the ideological revolution is to eliminate selfishness. It is not enough to just talk about 'eliminating selfishness'; the Chinese people use the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate selfishness. The Red Guards born in the cultural revolution are loyal executors of the destruction of the old bourgeoisie and the establishment of the new proletariat."

	Fuzhu Li Meishi said: "The cultural revolution in China is being carried out vigorously, which is a necessary step to establish proletarian literature and art in China. In a class society, literature and art have class characteristics and serve a certain politics. Chairman Mao further developed this theory in the cultural revolution, which is a contribution to the world revolution."

	Samaranaika, a member of the delegation from the Sri Lanka China Friendship Association, said: "The proletarian cultural revolution in China not only defends China's socialist system but has also had an impact worldwide. He also said: "We heard the Red Guards reciting Chairman Mao's quotations everywhere, singing songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The Red Guards' boundless love for Chairman Mao and revolutionary enthusiasm have greatly inspired everyone."

	Adama, the commercial manager of the state-owned import-export company of Mali, who was invited to participate in the China Export Commodities Fair, said: "The proletarian cultural revolution in China is Chairman Mao's brilliant new initiative, which is an outstanding contribution to the international communist movement." Adama said: "We have seen with our own eyes the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Chinese Red Guards and the great cultural revolution led by the great and wise Chairman Mao, which is continuously achieving victories. More importantly, we have understood that the proletarian cultural revolution being carried out in China has extremely profound historical significance and is a very important historical event in the international communist movement." He said: "The young Red Guards enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought increasingly widespread and deeply rooted in people's hearts, giving us great encouragement."

	Mohammed Hawrani, deputy director of the Sana'a Radio Station in Yemen, said: "The proletarian cultural revolution currently being carried out in China is entirely in line with the wishes of the Chinese people and is very timely and necessary. It will make China's old face completely renewed."

	Mohammed Oulashi, director of the Planning and Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Interior and Local Administration of Yemen, said: "The cultural revolution in China was initiated by Chairman Mao, and the Red Guards are led by Chairman Mao. We were warmly welcomed by the Red Guards and revolutionary people everywhere in China."

	Luis Oya, head of the Chilean cultural delegation, said: "The proletarian cultural revolution is the greatest mass movement in Chinese history. Chairman Mao has further developed, comprehensively, and creatively Marxism-Leninism. The cultural revolution is an extremely profound revolution, which will have a far-reaching impact on the world revolution and is a major step in promoting the world revolution."

	A member of the delegation, Kalmona, said: "The proletarian cultural revolution in China has made imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries afraid, while people all over the world are overjoyed. This is what Chairman Mao said, 'Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.' He said: "The Chinese people have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, making the socialist revolution never change color. The cultural revolution is uniting the 700 million Chinese people with Mao Zedong Thought, making them as united as one person. This is a force to bury imperialism, an invincible force." Another member, Monteiro, said: "The Chinese people have sounded the bugle call for the cultural revolution, strengthening the revolutionary resolve of the people of the world."

	Eliseo Salvador Portela, head of the delegation from the Uruguay China Cultural Association, said: "Chairman Mao personally led and initiated the cultural revolution to prevent the remnants of the bourgeoisie from counterattacking the proletarian dictatorship, pushing the proletarian revolution to a deeper stage that socialist countries have never reached. The cultural revolution has profound significance for the proletarian revolution. After the proletariat seizes power, class struggle still exists. Without the cultural revolution, the fruits of revolutionary victory may slip away like fish from an unknotted net, and the revolution may be half-hearted. Therefore, the cultural revolution must be carried out to the end, and the 'shark' of the bourgeoisie must be caught, so that the fruits of revolutionary victory can be consolidated. We have seen in China that through the cultural revolution, the Chinese people have generated tremendous power." Portela also highly praised the Red Guards, saying: "The Red Guards are not only the vanguard of the Chinese revolution but also the vanguard of the world revolution. The Red Guards are creating history."

    亚非拉朋友热烈赞颂毛主席的天才创举
    中国文化大革命比历史上任何革命都伟大
    用毛泽东思想统一起来的七亿中国人民是一支埋葬帝国主义的力量
    据新华社十七日讯　最近访问中国的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的各国朋友在回国前纷纷发表访华观感，热情地赞扬和高度评价我国人民进行的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。他们指出，中国文化大革命增强了世界人民的革命决心，鼓舞着全世界革命人民反对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的斗争。这场文化大革命比历史上任何革命都更加伟大，它必将大大加快世界革命的历史进程。
    日中友协第十三次访华代表团团长足立梅市说：“无产阶级在夺取政权和改变所有制后，还必须进行意识形态的革命。苏联在夺取政权、奠定社会主义基础后，由于没有进行思想革命，因而出现了现代修正主义，使苏联向资本主义倒退。毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，就是为了解决社会主义国家不出修正主义的问题，使中国永远不变颜色。这对世界革命具有重大意义。”足立梅市说：“中国文化大革命是在毛泽东思想指引下进行的。文化大革命就是要消灭资产阶级思想残余。思想革命的核心是灭私。光是口头上讲‘灭私’是不行的，中国人民用毛泽东思想的强大武器来灭私。文化大革命中诞生的红卫兵，是大破剥削阶级四旧，大立无产阶级四新的忠实执行者。”
    足立梅市说：“中国的文化大革命搞得轰轰烈烈，这是在中国确立无产阶级文学艺术的必然步骤。在阶级社会里，文学艺术是有阶级性的，是为一定的政治服务的。毛主席在文化大革命中进一步发展了这一理论，这是对世界革命的贡献。”
    锡兰中国友好协会代表团团员萨马拉纳亚克说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命，不仅捍卫了中国的社会主义制度，并已在全世界范围内发生了影响。他还说：“我们到处听到红卫兵朗读毛主席语录，唱赞颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌和宣传毛泽东思想。红卫兵对毛主席的无比热爱和革命热情，人人都受到极大的感染。”
    应邀参加中国出口商品交易会的马里国营进出口公司商业经理阿达玛说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命是毛泽东主席天才的伟大的新创举，这是对国际共产主义运动的卓越贡献。”阿达玛说：“我们亲眼看到了中国红卫兵的革命热情，亲眼看到了伟大英明的毛泽东主席亲自领导的文化大革命正在不断取得胜利。更加重要的是，我们了解了中国进行的这场无产阶级文化大革命具有无比深远的历史意义，是国际共产主义运动中的一个极为重要的历史事件。”他说：“年轻的红卫兵热情地宣传毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想正在越来越广泛地深入人心，使我们感到巨大的鼓舞。”
    也门萨那电台副台长穆罕默德·豪兰尼说：“中国正在进行的这场无产阶级文化大革命是完全出于中国人民的愿望，是非常适时的、必要的。它将使中国的旧面貌焕然一新。”
    也门内务和地方行政部计划检查局局长穆罕默德·奥拉希说：“中国的文化大革命是毛泽东主席亲自发动的，红卫兵是毛主席亲自领导的。我们在中国各地，都受到红卫兵和革命人民的热烈欢迎。”
    智利文化代表团团长路易斯·奥亚顺说：“无产阶级文化大革命是中国历史上最伟大的群众运动。毛泽东主席更好地、全面地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。文化大革命是一场极其深刻的革命，它必将对世界革命产生深远意义，是促进世界革命的一个重大步骤。”
    这个代表团的团员卡尔蒙纳说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命使得帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派害怕，而全世界人民都感到欢欣鼓舞。这就是毛主席所说的‘被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事’。”他说：“中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，就使社会主义革命永远不会变颜色。文化大革命正把七亿中国人民用毛泽东思想统一起来，团结得像一个人一样。这是一支埋葬帝国主义的力量，一支不可战胜的力量。”另一位团员蒙特罗说：“中国人民吹响了文化大革命的号角，增强了世界人民革命的决心。”
    乌拉圭中国文化协会代表团团长埃利塞奥·萨尔瓦多尔·波尔塔说：“毛主席亲自领导和发动文化大革命，防止资产阶级残余势力向无产阶级政权反扑，把无产阶级革命继续推进到世界各社会主义国家从来没有到达的一个更深的阶段。文化大革命对无产阶级革命具有深刻的意义。无产阶级在取得政权后，阶级斗争仍然存在。没有文化大革命，革命胜利的成果就有可能像鱼从没有打结的网底溜掉一样保不住，革命就要半途而废。因此，必须把文化大革命进行到底，把资产阶级这条‘鲨鱼’抓住，革命胜利的成果才能巩固。我们在中国看到，通过文化大革命，使中国人民产生了巨大的力量。”波尔塔还高度赞扬红卫兵说：“红卫兵不仅是中国革命的闯将，也是世界革命的闯将，红卫兵正在创造历史。”
