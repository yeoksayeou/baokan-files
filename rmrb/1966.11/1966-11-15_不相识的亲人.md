Recently, we arrived at the birthplace of the Cultural Revolution—Beijing, and everyone was overjoyed. However, shortly after arriving in Beijing, I suddenly fell ill. The teachers from Dongfanghong Primary School heard that I was sick, and several female teachers took turns pedaling a tricycle to take me to Beijing First Hospital for treatment.

Since I fell ill, many strangers who were like family members have been by my side, asking after my health. Some teachers even specially made dumplings for me. The mobile medical team's doctors came to treat me four or five times a day. One teacher, who is a mother of several children, treated me better than her own children. She often stayed with me until very late before going home, and came back very early in the morning. Sometimes when I fell asleep, she would quietly cover me with a blanket.

When she came to take care of me, I couldn't help but say a word of thanks to her, but she replied: "This is the care of the Party and Chairman Mao. It is Chairman Mao who told us to do this. You know how much hope Chairman Mao has placed in you young people!" These words are so moving!

    不相识的亲人
    最近，我们来到了文化大革命的策源地——北京，大家高兴极了。可是到北京不久，我突然得了病。东方红小学的老师们听说我病了，几个女同志轮流蹬着三轮车，把我送到北京市第一医院去诊疗。
    自从我病倒以后，身边就来了许多不相识的亲人，对我问寒问暖。有的老师还特地为我包了饺子。巡回医疗组的大夫，每天四五次来治疗。有一位老师，她是几个孩子的妈妈，对我比她自己的孩子还亲，经常侍候我到很晚才回去，早上很早又来了。有时我睡了，她就主动给我盖好被子。
    当她来照料我的时候，我禁不住要说一句谢她的话，可是她这样回答：“这是党和毛主席对你们的关怀，是毛主席要我们这样做的，你知道毛主席对你们青年人是寄托了多么大的希望！”这一段话，听了多使人感动啊！
