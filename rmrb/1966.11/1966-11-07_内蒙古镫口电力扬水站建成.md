Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the newly constructed Diankou (near Baotou City) powered irrigation station on the northern bank of the Yellow River in Inner Mongolia has been completed and has officially started production, pumping water for irrigation.

This is a large-scale powered irrigation station equipped with thirty-four large water pumps. It can draw water from the Yellow River to irrigate 550,000 mu (approximately 36,670 hectares) of farmland in the Tuoketuo River region and the suburbs of Baotou City, which is one of the major grain-producing areas in the autonomous region.
