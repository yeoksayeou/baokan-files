One evening after dinner, the Tan family of Longtan Brigade's Chongxing Temple Production Team in Nanchao County, Henan, held a study session to apply Chairman Mao's teachings. Tan Fulin, an impoverished farmer, said to his family, "Since our brigade started the campaign to study Chairman Mao's works, everything has changed. We can't fall behind! Tonight, let's have a study session to learn the article 'In Memory of Norman Bethune,' and see who studies the best."

Tan Fulin then discussed his thoughts on the phrase "completely selfless and devoted to others." He said, "In the past, I always thought: with you brothers and sisters working for the collective, it's fine. I'm over fifty, I should stay home and do some housework, enjoy a bit of comfort, it's only fair. I spent all day in my private plot, sometimes even spreading good fertilizer there. This selfish behavior was completely wrong. In the old society, our family lived on gruel and wild vegetables. In 1942, we fled to Deng County to beg for food, and our family nearly starved to death. Now, our lives are better than ever. This is all thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao, and to the collective economy of the people's commune. In the past, I only thought about our little 'home,' and didn't think about the country and the collective, the big 'home.' This was because my private interests were too heavy, and I didn't listen to Chairman Mao's words. After learning about Comrade Bethune's spirit, using the eight characters 'completely selfless and devoted to others' as a mirror, I was able to shake off some of my private interests and care more about the collective. Recently, I actively participated in the anti-drought efforts, carrying water for several days. The team leader cared for me, saying I was old and disabled, and should do some lighter work. I said: fighting the drought is for the revolution, doing the revolution means to be like Bethune, giving it our all; picking the light work and avoiding the heavy, how can that be truly devoted to the revolution?"

As soon as the old man finished speaking, his eldest son, Tan Zhenlang (the brigade accountant), began to examine himself in light of Comrade Bethune's two "extremes." He said, "The other day, I went out to work in the morning and was busy until the sun was setting. Just as I was about to go home for dinner, comrade Li Jinceng asked me to go to the brigade office to write him a certificate so he could go out to collect sideline income for the team. At that time, I was tired and hungry, and I unwillingly replied: 'The person is public, but the stomach is not public, wait a moment, I have to go home to eat!' With that, I turned and left. Walking along, I thought, that's not right: the comrade is doing work for the collective, and I didn't do it for him. Can this be considered taking extreme responsibility for work and having extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people? Thinking of this, I felt very ashamed, and quickly turned back, calling Jinceng to go to the brigade office with me. On the way, I made a self-criticism to him. I finished his paperwork, and although it was very late, my heart was very comfortable. Because I once again used Chairman Mao's thoughts to overcome private thoughts and did something beneficial to the people."

Tan Fulin's wife, Yan Rongfu, after listening to the two of them speak, hurriedly said to her children, "In the past, I had the same thoughts as your father. The team regulations said to pen in the chickens and pigs, but I didn't want to, often letting them out to eat the collective's crops when no one was looking. Through study, comparing myself to Comrade Bethune's spirit of 'completely selfless and devoted to others,' I felt very ashamed and hated myself for being a selfish person. Now, I pen in the chickens and pigs very securely. One day, the pig pen door wasn't closed properly, and the pig ran out to eat the team's crops. When I saw it, it was like it was eating my heart, and I quickly chased it back. Because of this, I also actively made a self-criticism at the community meeting."

The old woman's progress made the whole family very happy. Thirteen-year-old daughter Tan Zhenling said with satisfaction, "Mom studied Chairman Mao's works and made such quick progress. In the past, she always complained that I was lazy at home and diligent outside, but now she urges me to go to work early every day and do more collective work."

Zhenlang's wife, Du Changfen, also spoke up, "The other day, we few female community members were weeding sweet potatoes. The sister from the front yard only rushed forward and didn't weed the grass cleanly. I wanted to point out her mistake, but before the words left my mouth, I thought, this person is hard to deal with, she's called 'untouchable,' so I thought I wouldn't say anything. But then I thought of 'completely selfless and devoted to others' and the two 'extremes,' and immediately pointed out her mistake to her. Sure enough, she didn't accept the criticism, and instead said, 'Don't be like a dog biting a mouse—mind your own business.' I thought: I am a member of the people's commune, I must take extreme responsibility for my work and have extreme enthusiasm for my comrades, so I smiled and said to her: 'You're not studying Chairman Mao's works? You're not listening to Chairman Mao's words? Comrade Bethune took extreme responsibility for his work, treating the wounded with meticulous care, how is the quality of your weeding?' This made her admit her mistake."

Tan Fulin's second son, Tan Zhensong, is a middle school student who returned home on vacation. He shared his recent labor experience with the whole family. He said, "As soon as I got home, I saw that there was a lot of grass in the fields, so I went to weed the corn. The first two days were fine, but by the third day, I couldn't take it anymore. My waist hurt, my legs were weak, and my arms were sore. I really wanted to ask the team leader to let me turn the sweet potato seedlings and rest my hands and feet. But as soon as I went out, I saw on the blackboard the phrase 'completely selfless and devoted to others,' and I thought: I must overcome this thought of picking the light work and avoiding the heavy, and of being selfish. I am a member of the Communist Youth League, I should go to the hard places to temper myself. Thinking of this, I went back to weed the corn. Others cared for me, saying they would let me do some lighter work, but I said: it's okay, Chairman Mao's works have given me unlimited strength."

After everyone spoke, Tan Fulin suggested to the family, "In the future, all of us should often compare ourselves to Comrade Bethune's spirit. When it comes to collective matters, we must take extreme responsibility, and we must care for and help our class brothers. Only then can we truly do 'completely selfless and devoted to others.' Only when socialist construction is done well can our lives be even sweeter. Everyone agreed with the old man's suggestion.

    甩掉“一口观”  事事想集体
    ——记一家贫农社员的一次家庭讲用会
    有一天晚饭后，河南南召县龙潭大队崇兴寺生产队贫农社员谭福林一家人，开了一次活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。谭福林老汉对全家人说：“咱队自从开展学习毛主席著作运动以来，各方面都变样了。咱们可不能落后啊！今天晚上咱开个讲用会，学习《纪念白求恩》这篇文章，看谁学得好？”
    接着，谭福林谈起了自己学习“毫不利己专门利人”八个字前后的思想变化。他说：“以前我老是想：有你们兄妹几个干集体活就行了，我五十多岁啦，在家搞点家务事，享两天福，也是应该的。我就整天在自留地里干活，有时把好粪往自留地上。这种自私自利的行为，真是错误极了。在旧社会，咱一家人过着吃糠咽菜的日子，一九四二年出外逃荒要饭，几口人差一点饿死在邓县。现在咱的生活比旧社会好到天上了。这都是托了党和毛主席的福，托了人民公社集体经济的福。过去我老想着咱们这个小‘家’，心里没有国家、集体这个大‘家’。这就是私心太重，没有听毛主席的话。学了白求恩同志的精神后，用‘毫不利己专门利人’八个大字作镜子，才把私心甩掉了一些，对集体比过去操心了。最近，我积极参加抗旱，一直担了几天水。队长关心我，说我年纪大、有残疾，要我干点轻活。我说：抗旱是为了革命，干革命就要像白求恩那样尽心尽力；拣轻躲重，那还能算真心真意地干革命吗？”
    老汉的话刚落音，他的大儿子谭振堂（大队会计），对照白求恩同志两个“极端”的精神，检查起自己来了。他说：“大前天，我早晨外出工作，一直忙到日头偏西，正要回家吃饭时，社员李金城要我到大队部给他开个证明，他好出外给队里收副业款。当时我又累又饿，不高兴地回答：‘人是公的，肚子不是公的，你等等罢，我得回去吃饭哩！’说罢扭头走开了。走着走着，我想想不对头：社员为集体办事，我没有给他办，这能算对工作极端负责任，对同志对人民极端热忱吗？想到这里，我心里很惭愧，连忙回头，喊了金城一块到大队部去，路上我向他作了检讨。我给他办完手续，天虽然很晚了，可是，我心里却很舒坦。因为我又一次用毛主席的思想战胜了私心杂念，做了一件有益于人民的事。”
    谭福林的老伴阎荣福，听罢两个人的发言，忙对儿女们说：“我过去和你爹是一号思想，队里规定叫圈鸡、圈猪，我不愿意，往往在别人看不见的时候，把鸡、猪放开去吃集体的庄稼。通过学习，对照白求恩‘毫不利己专门利人’的精神，我十分惭愧，痛恨自己不该做个损公利私的人。现在我把鸡猪圈得可牢实了，有一天猪圈门没上好，猪跑出来啃队里的庄稼，我一见真像是啃自己的心一样，赶紧把它撵回来。为这事我还主动在社员会上作了检讨。”
    老大娘的进步，使全家人格外高兴。十三岁的女儿谭振玲满意地说：“妈学习了毛主席著作，进步真快，以往老是嚷我在家懒在外勤，现在天天催我早上工，多干集体活。”
    振堂的爱人杜长凤也开腔了：“前天俺们几个女社员锄红薯，前院嫂子只顾往前赶，没把草锄净，我想给她提意见，话还没吐口，心里就想着这人不好惹，人称‘惹不起’，于是就想不提了。可是，我想起了
  ‘毫不利己专门利人’和两个‘极端’，就立即给她指出错误。果然，她不接受意见，反说：‘别狗咬老鼠——多管闲事。’我想：我是人民公社社员，我要对工作极端负责，对同志极端热忱，便笑着对她说：‘你不是学习了毛主席著作吗？你不是要听毛主席的话吗？白求恩同志对工作极端负责任，给伤员治病精益求精，你锄的地质量怎么样？’这一说，她才承认了错误。”
    谭福林的二儿子谭振松，是放假回乡的中学生。他向全家人谈了他最近参加劳动的体会。他说：“我一到家，看到地里草多，就下地锄玉米，头两天还行，到第三天就支持不住了，腰痛、腿软、胳膊酸，真想向队长要求去翻红薯秧，歇歇手脚。可是一出门，我看到黑板报上写着‘毫不利己专门利人’的语录，心里想：我这拣轻怕重、专门利己的思想必须克服。我是共青团员，应该到艰苦的地方去锻炼。想到这里，我又去锄玉米了。别人关心我，说给我换点轻活干，我说：不要紧，毛主席著作给我增添了无限力量。”
    全家人都讲了一遍，谭福林老汉给大家提出建议：以后咱一家人都要经常对照白求恩精神，遇到集体的事，一定要极端负责任，对阶级兄弟一定要关心帮助，真正做到“毫不利己专门利人”。只有社会主义建设搞好了，我们的日子才能更甜。大家都同意老汉的意见。
