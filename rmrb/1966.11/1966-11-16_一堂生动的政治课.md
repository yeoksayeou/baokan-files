We, the "Long March Red Guards," marched from Dalian to Beijing on foot. Along the way, we learned many things from the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals that we could not learn in the classroom. One month of marching on foot was like attending a vivid political lesson.

What educated us the most was the boundless love, respect, and worship that the broad masses have for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Everywhere we went, the masses eagerly asked us to convey their greetings to Chairman Mao, wishing him eternal life! Many people stayed up all night to write letters to Chairman Mao, which they handed to us with both hands, asking us to deliver them to the great leader.

In Jin County, we visited Ma Yucheng, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants. When he learned that we were marching to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, he immediately enthusiastically instructed us, "When you see Chairman Mao, be sure to convey our greetings to him. Also, please tell Chairman Mao: Since the Cultural Revolution began, all the villagers in our village have launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Every Tuesday and Thursday, the villagers study together, and every Saturday, the militia company studies together. The rest of the time, we study in families and in the fields. This way, we study every day and apply what we learn at all times. The villagers' consciousness has been raised, and good deeds are constantly emerging. Production is getting better and better, and this year we achieved a bumper harvest."

Ma Yucheng has been persistently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works for many years and resolutely following Chairman Mao's instructions. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, he pays attention to doing ideological work among the villagers. When the village was digging wells, the bourgeois "experts" scared the villagers, saying that water could not be found there. He then organized the villagers to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," educating everyone to have the courage to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. The villagers fought bravely against the earth, finally digging several good wells. This turned the previously water-scarce area into a place where not only the drinking water problem was solved, but also most of the land had irrigation water.

After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Ma Yucheng treated the villagers' difficulties as his own. During the period of economic difficulties, he himself saved money to help others. He once risked his life to stop a frightened horse-drawn carriage, resulting in the others escaping, but his two front teeth were knocked out. He also once risked his life to jump into a well to save someone. The reason is that he firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: to die for the people is a most glorious death.

Along the way, we visited many active learners of Chairman Mao's works, all of whom educated us greatly. Their words and deeds increased our love for Chairman Mao and inspired us to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

We also visited class education exhibitions, paid tribute to the revolutionary martyrs of the Battle of Tashan, listened to old soldiers of the Eighth Route Army recount revolutionary struggle history, and listened to old workers and poor peasants recall bitterness and sweetness. All of these gave us a profound class education.

The one-month march from Dalian to Beijing was a bit tiring, but we gained a great harvest in our thoughts. We are determined to learn the revolutionary spirit of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and to resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    一堂生动的政治课
    我们“长征红卫队”从大连步行来到北京，一路上向广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子学习了许多在课堂上学不到的东西。徒步行军一个月，等于上了一堂生动的政治课。
    使我们受教育最深的，是广大群众对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱、无限敬仰和无限崇拜。
    每到一处，群众都纷纷要求代问毛主席好，祝他老人家万寿无疆！有不少人连夜赶写给毛主席的信，双手递给我们，让我们带给伟大领袖。
    在金县，我们访问了学习毛主席著作积极分子、贫协代表马玉成同志。当他知道我们是步行去北京见毛主席的，马上热情地嘱咐我们：“你们见到毛主席，千万要代我们向他老人家问好。还请告诉毛主席：从开展文化大革命以来，我们全村社员掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，每星期二、四，社员集体学习，星期六，民兵连集体学习，其余时间就家庭学，地头学。这样天天学，时时用，社员觉悟都有提高，好人好事不断出现。生产搞得越来越好，今年夺得了一个大丰收。”
    马玉成同志多年来坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚决照毛主席的指示办事。他根据毛主席的教导，注意在社员中做思想工作。村里打井的时候，资产阶级“专家”吓唬社员，说当地打不出水来。他就组织社员学习《愚公移山》，教育大家树立排除万难，去争取胜利的勇气。社员们斗志昂扬地向地球开战，终于打成了好几口水井，使这个过去的缺水地区，不仅解决了吃水问题，还使大部分土地有了灌溉用水。
    马玉成学了《为人民服务》以后，把社员的困难当作自己的困难，经济暂时困难时期，他自己省吃俭用帮助别人。他曾不顾一切拦截受惊的马车，结果别人脱险，自己的门牙被撞掉两个。他还曾不顾生命危险，跳到井里救人。原因是他牢牢记着毛主席的教导：为人民而死，就是死得其所。
    一路上，我们访问了好多位学习毛主席著作积极分子，都使我们受到很大教育。他们的言行事迹，使我们增加了对毛主席的热爱，鼓舞着我们更好地活学活用毛主席著作。
    我们在路上还参观过阶级教育展览，瞻仰了塔山阻击战革命烈士纪念塔，请八路军的老战士讲革命斗争史，请老工人、老贫农忆苦思甜。这都使我们受到了深刻的阶级教育。
    从大连步行到北京的一个月，虽然辛苦一点，但是思想上获得了一个大丰收。我们决心学习工农兵的革命精神，努力活学活用毛主席著作，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
