We are commemorating Lu Xun during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has profound significance both domestically and internationally.

Lu Xun's life was one of struggle and rebellion.

He fought relentlessly against feudalism, imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, fascism, and the modern revisionism represented by Zhou Yang's "whole nation literature."

Our great leader Chairman Mao has given Lu Xun the highest evaluation. Chairman Mao said:

"Lu Xun is the main leader of the Chinese cultural revolution. He is not only a great literary figure but also a great thinker and a great revolutionary."

"Lu Xun is the most correct, bravest, most resolute, most loyal, most enthusiastic, and unprecedented national hero who, on the cultural front, represents the majority of the nation and charges into the enemy's ranks."

"The direction of Lu Xun is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation."

Of course, Lu Xun's life had a definite developmental process. He was a practitioner of Chairman Mao's revolutionary theory. In the course of continuous struggle, he was influenced by the developing revolutionary forces of China, which promoted his own continuous progress; in turn, he promoted the continuous progress of Chinese revolutionary culture with his own continuous progress.

In his later years, Lu Xun achieved brilliant results in the cultural "encirclement and suppression" by the Kuomintang reactionary forces. He progressed from a democrat to a communist.

Chairman Mao said: "The communist Lu Xun became a great figure in the Chinese cultural revolution in this 'encirclement and suppression.'"

Chairman Mao also said: "Lu Xun's later essays are the most profound and powerful, and they are not one-sided, precisely because at this time he had mastered dialectics."

Lu Xun's spirit of learning and revolution are inseparable. He can truly be said to be "insatiable in learning and tireless in fighting." Learning is for the revolution, and the revolution is for the people. Chairman Mao often teaches us: revolutionaries must believe in the people, rely on the people, and serve the people wholeheartedly; first be a student, then a teacher. Lu Xun truly followed this instruction.

Lu Xun has two famous lines of poetry: "With a stern brow, I face a thousand accusers; with a bowed head, I am willing to be an ox for the children," which is a very outstanding self-portrait of Lu Xun.

Chairman Mao particularly appreciates these two lines of poetry, believing that "they should become our motto."

Today, we commemorate Lu Xun to follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "Learn from Lu Xun's example, be the 'ox' for the proletariat and the masses, work tirelessly, and strive until death."

Lu Xun has always been obedient to the correct leadership of the Party. He believed that the Communist Party of China is the general headquarters of the cultural revolution.

In a letter dated June 9, 1936 (about four months before Lu Xun's death), Lu Xun repeatedly praised Chairman Mao and denounced the Trotskyites of that time. Lu Xun frankly said:

"I, even if I am not very capable, am definitely far removed from you (Trotskyites). Those who are steadfast, with their feet firmly on the ground, and who are fighting and shedding blood for the survival of the Chinese people today, I consider them comrades, and I am proud of it."

Lu Xun was willing to regard Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's close comrades-in-arms as comrades and to consider it an honor. In my opinion, this can be regarded as Lu Xun's application to join the Party shortly before his death. Chairman Mao later affirmed Lu Xun as a "communist," which can also be regarded as Lu Xun's application having been approved by the Party.

Two months later, on August 6, 1936, in the letter "Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front," Lu Xun said:

"The current revolutionary party in China has proposed to the people of the whole country the policy of the anti-Japanese united front. I have seen it, I support it, and I unconditionally join this front."

Lu Xun always listened to the Party's words and unconditionally supported the Party's policies, sang the praises of the Party, and especially had a fervent belief in Chairman Mao.

We should learn from Lu Xun, that is, learn from the good example he left for us. Today, our era is completely different from the time when Lu Xun was alive in every respect. Almost everyone has Chairman Mao's quotations, Chairman Mao's selected works, and Chairman Mao's poems. What we see is glorious achievements. What we hear is a surging chorus. We can also see Chairman Mao with our own eyes and hear Chairman Mao's instructions with our own ears. How fortunate we are! We should strive even harder to "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao."

Today, we are very happy to see that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has become the unified ideology of the 700 million people of the whole country and will also become the action guide for all our work for generations to come. In this way, we will have unified understanding, unified will, and unified feelings, not only to make our iron-clad mountains and rivers unchangeable, but also to see that the people of the whole world who strive for liberation and progress will walk with us on the same path.

If Lu Xun were still alive today, he would be so happy! He would definitely stand at the forefront of the cultural revolution, charge into the enemy's ranks with us, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, tread a path that no one has ever trodden before, and scale a peak that no one has ever climbed.

Finally, I would like to mention one thing and ask comrades to pay attention. September 25 this year marks the 85th anniversary of Lu Xun's birth. Some countries also hold commemorations on this day. Lu Xun is respected by international friends, and we feel inspired. However, it is undeniable that some people use the pretext of commemorating Lu Xun to distort Lu Xun and engage in rampant anti-China activities. The modern revisionists in the Soviet Union are an example.

From what I have seen, the Soviet Union has a magazine that, in a column titled "Celebrating the 85th Anniversary of the Birth of the Great Chinese Writer Lu Xun," published an article titled "The Writer Continues to Fight."

In an article of about 2,400 to 2,500 words, not a single word about Chairman Mao's praise for Lu Xun is mentioned. It deliberately distorts and obliterates Lu Xun's revolutionary fighting spirit, saying that the "writer (Lu Xun) has deep humanity and love for people."

So, "the writer continues to fight," against whom and what is he fighting?

Another small newspaper in the Soviet Union also published an article titled "Remembering Lu Xun," using the same tricks.

These lackeys of modern revisionism arrogantly use the pretext of commemorating Lu Xun to distort Lu Xun, attempting to achieve their evil goal of rampant anti-China, anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

We warn these buzzing flies and seemingly powerful bears and tigers: you pests, in the era of "the seas churn and the clouds rage, and the winds and thunder shake the five continents," the day when you will be thoroughly swept away by the people of all countries is not far off!

Lu Xun's spirit of rebellion is immortal!

Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great leader, great supreme commander, great helmsman, and great teacher Chairman Mao!

    纪念鲁迅的造反精神
    郭沫若
    我们在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中来纪念鲁迅，对于国内国外都有深远的意义。
    鲁迅的一生是战斗的一生，造反的一生。
    他对于封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义、法西斯主义以及周扬的“全民文学”所代表的现代修正主义，毫不放松地战斗着，战斗着，一直战斗到他最后的一刻。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席对于鲁迅作了极高度的评价。毛主席说：
    “鲁迅是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家和伟大的革命家。”
    “鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。”
    “鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。”
    当然，鲁迅的一生是有一定的发展过程的。他是毛主席革命理论的实践者。他在不断斗争中受到了发展着的中国革命势力的影响，促进了自己的不断进展；回头又以自己的不断进展，促进了中国革命文化的不断进展。
    鲁迅在他的晚年，在国民党反动势力的文化“围剿”中，战果是十分辉煌的。他由民主主义者跃进而为共产主义者了。
    毛主席说：“共产主义者的鲁迅，却正在这一‘围剿’中成了中国文化革命的伟人。”
    毛主席又说：“鲁迅后期的杂文最深刻有力，并没有片面性，就是因为这时候他学会了辩证法。”
    鲁迅的学习精神和革命精神是相为表里的。他真可以说是“学而不厌，战而不倦”。学习是为了革命，革命是为了人民。毛主席经常教导我们：革命者必须相信人民，依靠人民，全心全意为人民服务；先做学生，后做先生。鲁迅正切实地做到了这一指示。
    鲁迅有两句脍炙人口的诗：“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”，这是很杰出的鲁迅自画像。
    毛主席特别欣赏这两句诗，认为“应该成为我们的座右铭”。
    我们今天来纪念鲁迅，就是要照着毛主席的指示办事：“学鲁迅的榜样，做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”
    鲁迅一向是服从党的正确领导的。他认为中国共产党就是文化革命的总司令部。
    在一九三六年六月九日（离鲁迅逝世前四个多月），鲁迅在《答托洛斯基派的信》中，一再地称颂毛主席而痛斥当时的托洛斯基分子。鲁迅光明磊落地这样说：
    “我，即使怎样不行，自觉和你们（托派）总是相离很远的罢。那切切实实，足踏在地上，为着现在中国人的生存而流血奋斗者，我得引为同志，是自以为光荣的。”
    鲁迅愿意把毛主席和毛主席的亲密战友“引为同志”而能“自以为光荣”，在我看来，这可以认为是鲁迅临死前不久的申请入党书。毛主席后来肯定鲁迅为“共产主义者”，这也可以认为鲁迅的申请书已经得到了党的批准。
    再晚两个月的一九三六年八月六日，鲁迅在《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》的信里面又说：
    “中国目前的革命的政党向全国人民所提出的抗日统一战线的政策，我是看见的，我是拥护的，我无条件地加入这战线”。
    鲁迅就是始终听党的话，无条件地拥护党的政策、歌颂党，特别是热烈信仰毛主席。
    我们要学习鲁迅，就是要学习鲁迅替我们留下来的这种良好的榜样。今天我们的时代比起鲁迅在生的当时，在一切条件上都有天渊之别了。我们每一个人差不多都有毛主席的语录、毛主席的选集、毛主席的诗词。入目有辉煌的成绩。入耳有浩荡的歌声。我们还可以亲眼看到毛主席，亲耳听到毛主席的指示。我们是多么幸运呵！我们就应该更加百倍努力地“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”
    我们今天很高兴地看到战无不胜的毛泽东思想已经成为全中国七亿人民的统一思想，而且还要成为我们世世代代一切工作的行动指南。这样我们便有统一认识、统一意志、统一感情，不仅会使我们铁打的江山永不变色，而且会看到全世界要求解放、要求进步的人民会和我们走到同一条道路上来。
    鲁迅如果还活在今天，他是会多么高兴啊！他一定会站在文化革命战线的前头行列，冲锋陷阵，同我们一起，在毛主席的领导下，踏出前人所没有走过的道路，攀上前人所没有攀登过的高峰。
    最后我想顺便提到一件事情，请同志们注意。今年九月二十五日是鲁迅诞生八十五周岁。有的国家也有人在这个日子里举行纪念的。鲁迅受到国际友人的尊重，我们是感到鼓舞的。但不容讳言，有的人却是假借纪念鲁迅之名，而进行歪曲鲁迅、猖狂反华之实。苏联现代修正主义者便是一个例子。
    就我所见到的材料来说，苏联有一个杂志，在所谓《迎接中国伟大作家鲁迅诞生八十五周年》栏中，发表一篇文章，题目叫《作家在继续斗争》。
    在约有二千四五百字的文章中，对于毛主席评赞鲁迅的话一个字也没有提到，故意歪曲和抹杀鲁迅的革命战斗精神，而说什么“作家（鲁迅）怀着深刻的人性和对人们的爱”。
    那么“作家在继续斗争”，是在向谁斗争，向什么斗争呢？
    另外苏联还有一个小报，发表了一篇什么《忆鲁迅》的文章，完全玩弄着同样的手法。
    这些现代修正主义者的小娄罗们，他们狂妄地假借纪念鲁迅来歪曲鲁迅，以企图达到猖狂反华、反共、反人民、反毛泽东思想的罪恶目的。
    我们要警告这些嗡嗡叫的苍蝇和比它们貌似强大的熊罴虎豹：你们这些害人虫，在“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”的时代，被各国人民彻底扫荡干净的日子，已经不远了！
    鲁迅的造反精神不朽！
    把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！
