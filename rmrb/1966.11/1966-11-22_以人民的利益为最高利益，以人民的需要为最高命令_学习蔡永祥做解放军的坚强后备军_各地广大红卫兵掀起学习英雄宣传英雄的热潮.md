In recent days, broad masses of Red Guards in many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have, with hearts full of respect, extensively launched activities to learn from Comrade Cai Yongxiang, a selfless communist warrior and a loyal defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The young Red Guards have expressed their determination to follow in Cai Yongxiang's footsteps, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to put the people's interests above all, to follow the people's needs as the highest command, to fear neither hardship nor death, to seek neither fame nor gain, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Broad masses of Red Guards have launched a wave of learning from and propagating heroes. In the hero's hometown of Hefei, Anhui Province, 5,000 Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students held a meeting to learn from and commemorate the hero, inviting Cai Yongxiang's elder brother, Cai Yonglong, to introduce Cai Yongxiang's life story. Red Guards in remote cities such as Lhasa, Urumqi, and Hohhot have, in recent days, gathered with Red Guards from inland areas for meetings and discussions to learn from Cai Yongxiang. In Shenyang, many schools' Red Guards have cut out Cai Yongxiang's photos and study notes from newspapers, pasted them in their notebooks, and used them as mirrors to constantly reflect on themselves, pushing themselves to study Chairman Mao's works and transform their worldviews. Some cities' Red Guards have also created and performed various artistic programs, such as poems, quick-talk, and couplets, to sing the praises of the hero. They said: Cai Yongxiang sacrificed his life to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We learn from Cai Yongxiang to deeply study the hero, sing the praises of the hero, and perform the hero, so that Cai Yongxiang's selfless communist spirit can deeply enter people's hearts and be known to every household.

Broad masses of Red Guards believe that Cai Yongxiang is a new communist person nurtured by the great crucible of the People's Liberation Army, which Chairman Mao personally created. While learning from Cai Yongxiang's noble qualities, they must further deeply carry out learning from the People's Liberation Army, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizes proletarian politics. Red Guards from many schools in the capital and from various provinces and municipalities who came to the capital for revolutionary linkage said: "In this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, the People's Liberation Army, Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang and other communist warriors have been nurtured, setting one shining example after another for us. As the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army, Red Guards must forever learn from the People's Liberation Army, like the People's Liberation Army, to make studying Chairman Mao's works the first need in life, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher." In Shanghai, Red Guards from East China Normal University said: "Defending the Party Central Committee, defending Chairman Mao, and defending Mao Zedong Thought is our sacred duty as Red Guards. We learn from the People's Liberation Army and must, like Cai Yongxiang, act in the interests of the Party, the people, and the state, daring to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, resolutely defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and thoroughly criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line." Red Guards in Hefei said: "In the turbulent waves of class struggle, we are determined to take the People's Liberation Army as our example, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to consciously temper ourselves in class struggle, to become steadfast proletarian revolutionary warriors, and to become far-sighted and courageous revolutionary pioneers." Red Guards from Beijing, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and other places who went to Lhasa for revolutionary linkage said, in a discussion meeting to learn from Cai Yongxiang's deeds, that the People's Liberation Army is the best army in the world, the People's Liberation Army loves Red Guards the most, and we resolutely learn from and carry forward the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, strictly observe the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention, and with the thorough revolutionary spirit of "not a true hero until one reaches the Great Wall," we carry out revolutionary linkage, learn, implement, propagate, and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Broad masses of Red Guards, from Cai Yongxiang's deeds of becoming a selfless communist warrior in just eight months of enlistment, have seen more clearly the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought in nurturing a new generation. They resolutely declared that they would cultivate the high consciousness of Cai Yongxiang, who said, "One can go a day without eating, but one cannot go a day without studying Chairman Mao's works." Red Guards in Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Nanjing, Xi'an, Chengdu, and other cities, in conjunction with learning from Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds, launched a new wave of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many Red Guards carried the "Three Articles" with them to study and reflect on their thoughts and actions at any time. Red Guards who were about to set out on a long march for linkage also formulated plans to study Chairman Mao's works, determined to use the spirit of "seizing the day" on the march, to race against time, to read Chairman Mao's books, to learn as they go, and to temper themselves into steadfast and fearless successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. In Changchun, broad masses of Red Guards from universities and colleges such as Jilin University and Jilin Industrial University have, in recent days, been inspired by Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds to study the "Three Articles" over and over again. They said, Cai Yongxiang is a hero nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought, like Ouyang Hai. To learn from Cai Yongxiang, one must grasp the fundamental task of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, transform one's thoughts, and establish a selfless communist worldview. Only in this way can one, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fear no setbacks, fight bravely, and, under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, complete the tasks of "one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms."

    以人民的利益为最高利益，以人民的需要为最高命令
    学习蔡永祥做解放军的坚强后备军
    各地广大红卫兵掀起学习英雄宣传英雄的热潮
    据新华社二十一日讯　连日来，全国许多省、市、自治区的广大红卫兵小将，怀着崇敬的心情，广泛地开展了向一心为公的共产主义战士、无产阶级文化大革命的忠诚保卫者蔡永祥同志学习的活动。小将们纷纷表示：一定要像蔡永祥那样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以人民的利益为最高利益，以人民的需要为最高命令，不怕苦，不怕死，不为名，不为利，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    广大红卫兵小将掀起了学习英雄、宣传英雄的热潮。在英雄的家乡安徽省合肥市五千名红卫兵和革命师生，举行了学习和悼念英雄的大会，邀请蔡永祥的大哥蔡永龙介绍了蔡永祥生前事迹。我国边远城市拉萨、乌鲁木齐、呼和浩特的红卫兵，连日与来自内地的红卫兵一起集会座谈，向蔡永祥学习。在沈阳，许多学校的红卫兵，把蔡永祥的照片和学习心得笔记日记摘抄从报上剪下来，贴在自己的本子上，当作镜子，经常对照自己，推动自己努力学习毛主席著作，改造自己的世界观。有些城市的红卫兵小将，还连夜创作并演出歌颂英雄的诗歌、快板、对口词等各种文艺节目。他们说：蔡永祥为了保卫无产阶级文化大革命，献出了生命，我们学习蔡永祥，就要用最深厚的阶级感情学英雄、唱英雄、演英雄，让蔡永祥一心为公的共产主义思想深入人心，家喻户晓。
    广大红卫兵小将认为：蔡永祥是毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军这个大熔炉培育出来的一代共产主义新人。在学习蔡永祥高贵品质的同时，必须更深入地继续开展向高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、突出无产阶级政治的中国人民解放军学习。首都许多学校的红卫兵和来首都进行革命串连的各省市红卫兵说：“在解放军这个毛泽东思想大学校里，培养出雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊、蔡永祥等共产主义战士，给我们树立了一个又一个光辉的榜样，作为解放军后备军的红卫兵，要永远学习解放军，像解放军那样，把学习毛主席著作作为生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗高举再高举。”在上海，华东师范大学的红卫兵说：
  “保卫党中央、保卫毛主席、捍卫毛泽东思想是我们红卫兵的神圣职责，我们学习解放军，就要像蔡永祥那样处处从党的利益出发，从人民的利益出发，从国家的利益出发，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。”合肥市的红卫兵们说：“在阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪中，我们决心以解放军为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自觉地在阶级斗争中锻炼，使自己成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士，成为远见卓识、智勇双全的革命闯将。”从北京、内蒙古自治区等地到拉萨进行革命串连的红卫兵小将们，在学习蔡永祥事迹的座谈会上说，解放军是世界上最好的军队，解放军最爱红卫兵，我们坚决学习和发扬解放军的光荣传统，严格遵守三大纪律八项注意，用“不到长城非好汉”的彻底革命精神，进行革命串连，学习、贯彻、宣传、捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    广大红卫兵小将们，从蔡永祥入伍只有八个月就成长为一心为公的共产主义战士这个振奋人心的事迹中，更清楚地看到了毛泽东思想培育一代新人的无比威力。他们坚决表示，要养成蔡永祥那样
  “一天不吃饭可以，一天不学毛主席著作万万不行”的高度自觉性，狠学狠用毛主席著作。天津、广州、武汉、南京、西安、成都等城市的红卫兵们，结合学习蔡永祥的英雄事迹，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，许多红卫兵把“老三篇”带在身上随时学，随时对照自己的思想行动。即将出发长征串连的红卫兵，还制订了学习毛主席著作的计划，决心在征途中用“只争朝夕”的精神，争分夺秒，读毛主席的书，走一路、学一路，把自己锻炼成坚强无畏的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。在长春，吉林大学、吉林工业大学等大中院校的广大红卫兵，最近几天在蔡永祥英雄事迹的感召下，一遍又一遍地学习“老三篇”。他们说，蔡永祥是伟大毛泽东思想哺育起来的欧阳海式的英雄。学习蔡永祥，一定要抓活学活用毛主席著作这个根本，改造自己的思想，树立一心为公的共产主义世界观。只有这样，才能在无产阶级文化大革命中，不怕挫折，勇敢战斗，在伟大统帅毛主席的领导下，胜利完成“一斗、二批、三改”的任务。
