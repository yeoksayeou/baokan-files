Madrid, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) - The Franco fascist traitor government in Spain has blatantly persecuted Spanish anti-imperialist patriotic revolutionary fighter Paulino Garcia Moia and his comrades.

Paulino Garcia Moia fought in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) on the side of the Republican People's Army. He later went into exile for many years. He is a Marxist-Leninist who has dedicated himself to opposing U.S. imperialism, opposing the traitorous and reactionary policies of the Franco government, opposing the revisionist line led by the Spanish Communist Party, and fighting for Spanish independence and democracy. This April, he and several of his comrades were arrested and imprisoned in Madrid. The Franco fascist traitor government, in order to maintain its criminal reactionary rule, has blatantly persecuted Paulino Garcia Moia and his comrades, sentencing them to imprisonment. The Franco government's counter-revolutionary atrocity has sparked strong protests from revolutionary people in Spain and many European countries.

    抗议对反帝战士莫亚等的迫害
    新华社讯　马德里消息：西班牙佛朗哥法西斯卖国政府公然对西班牙反帝爱国革命战士保林诺·加西亚·莫亚和他的战友进行政治迫害。
    保林诺·加西亚·莫亚曾在西班牙内战时期（一九三六年至一九三九年）在共和国人民军方面进行革命斗争，后流亡国外多年。他是个马列主义者，致力于反对美帝国主义、反对佛朗哥政府的卖国反动政策、反对西班牙共产党领导的修正主义路线、争取西班牙独立和民主。今年四月他在马德里和他的几位战友同时被捕入狱。佛朗哥法西斯卖国政府为了维持罪恶的反动统治，公然对保林诺·加西亚·莫亚和他的战友进行迫害，判处他们徒刑。佛朗哥政府的这一反革命暴行激起了西班牙和欧洲许多国家革命人民的强烈抗议。
