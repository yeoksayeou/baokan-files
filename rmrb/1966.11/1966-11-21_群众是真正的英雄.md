The masses are the true heroes. Chairman Mao said: “The masses are the true heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and laughable.” The great victory achieved by the workers and young technicians of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in product design powerfully proves this truth.

The masses originally have rich practical experience and boundless wisdom. Once they are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they will be invincible. Those bourgeois “authorities” who merely copy and paste “foreign frameworks” and “foreign doctrines” are naive and laughable in the face of these people who possess true knowledge.

Our motherland has undergone earth-shaking changes. For countless years, workers and other laboring masses who were oppressed at the bottom of society have, in New China, not only become the masters of politics but also the masters of culture and science and technology. Some products designed by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory have been able to quickly catch up with and even surpass the world's advanced level precisely because the workers and young technicians there have become the masters of product design. These worker masses are the true heroes. With them, any miracle can be created.

    群众是真正的英雄
    毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。上海机床厂广大工人和青年技术人员在产品设计上取得的胜利，有力地证明了这个真理。
  群众本来有丰富的实践经验，又有无穷的聪明才智，他们一旦被毛泽东思想武装起来，更会无所不能。那些照抄、照搬“洋框框”“洋教条”的资产阶级“权威”们，在他们这些具有真知的人的面前，简直是幼稚得可笑。
    我们的祖国已经发生了翻天覆地的变化。过去多少年来被压在社会底层的工人以及其他劳动群众，在新中国，不但做了政治上的主人，也做了文化的主人，科学技术的主人。上海机床厂有些产品设计所以能迅速赶上和超过世界先进水平，就是因为那里的工人和青年技术人员做了产品设计的主人。这些工人群众是真正的英雄。有了他们，什么奇迹都可以创造出来。
