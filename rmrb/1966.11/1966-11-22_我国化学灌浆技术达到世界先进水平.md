    Hoisting High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought to Boost the Morale of the Chinese People
    China's Chemical Grouting Technology Reaches Advanced World Level

    A new type of chemical grouting material, Jiazhu, and a chemical grouting pump have been developed. Jiazhu is thinner than water and can be injected into cracks in concrete or stone that are thinner than a hair, effectively sealing them. This new product has significant implications for the maintenance of buildings and other structures.

    Our reporter informs that several hydropower engineering units and scientific research institutions in China, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have broken away from foreign frameworks, adhered to the spirit of self-reliance, and collaborated to successfully develop a new type of chemical grouting material and China's first chemical grouting pump. This has brought China's chemical grouting technology to an advanced world level.

    This chemical grouting material is called Jiazhu. It is thinner than water. Using a grouting pump, it can be injected into cracks in concrete or stone that are thinner than a hair, quickly seeping into the sides of the cracks by three to six millimeters, and firmly bonding them like rivets. This new product has significant implications for the maintenance of concrete hydropower engineering structures, buildings, bridges, railway slopes, wharves, and stone cultural relics.

    The average age of the personnel involved in the development of Jiazhu is only twenty-five. Most of them have recently started working and have no experience in producing chemical grouting materials. Due to the technological blockade imposed by imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists on China, there are no resources to refer to. During their work, some bourgeois technical "authorities" in China have strongly obstructed the experiments, saying, "Foreign countries have been working on this for so long and haven't achieved much, what can you achieve?" However, these obstacles and the numerous difficulties encountered in the work did not deter the revolutionary heroes with great aspirations. The experimenters, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dared to take the lead, determined to fight for the honor of the Chinese people, to catch up with and surpass the advanced world level, and persisted in the experiment.

    The process of experimenting with Jiazhu chemical grouting material is a process of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Initially, indoor experiments in Beijing lasted for nine months with slow progress and little achievement. The experimenters, with this problem in mind, studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and, following Chairman Mao's instructions, started field experiments at a certain hydropower site from June 1964, working with the workers to overcome difficulties.

    Jiazhu chemical grouting material is both water- and oxygen-sensitive. Water affects its bonding strength, and oxygen causes it to polymerize explosively. How to solve this problem? They encountered failures in the experiments. Later, they studied "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," gaining great inspiration. They changed their previous approach of only considering the material's performance in isolation and one-sidedly, boldly adopting measures to remove water and oxygen from the concrete cracks and dry them, pushing the experiment forward significantly.

    The field experiment of Jiazhu chemical grouting material could only be conducted under low-temperature conditions in winter. The experimenters and workers, to save time and increase speed, despite it not being winter, broke the rules and utilized the early morning when the temperature was lower to continue the experiments, accumulating a large amount of reliable data.

    Jiazhu chemical grouting material was finally successfully experimented with. However, many fine cracks on concrete structures are generally less than 0.3 millimeters, and without a specialized chemical grouting pump, Jiazhu still could not be injected. The party committee of a certain hydropower site assigned this task to its repair shop. This repair shop is small in scale and has poor equipment, making it difficult to complete the task. However, the workers, technicians, and cadres involved in the development of the chemical grouting pump studied Chairman Mao's works, liberated their minds, and carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to venture, and dare to revolutionize. They implemented the "three-in-one combination," after more than one hundred repeated experiments, and within twenty days, they manufactured China's first chemical grouting pump, ensuring that Jiazhu chemical grouting material could be applied to production on a large scale in a timely manner.

### 我国化学灌浆技术达到世界先进水平

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　大长中国人民的志气
    我国化学灌浆技术达到世界先进水平
    制成新型化学灌浆材料甲凝和化学灌浆泵。甲凝比水还稀，把它灌入混凝土或石头上比头发丝还细的裂缝，能把裂缝牢牢粘合。这种新产品对维修建筑物等具有重大意义。
    本报讯　我国一些水利工程单位和科学研究单位，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，破除洋框框，坚持自力更生精神，共同协作，最近试制成功一种新型化学灌浆材料和我国第一台化学灌浆泵，使我国化学灌浆技术达到了世界先进水平。
    这种化学灌浆材料名叫甲凝。它比水还稀，用灌浆泵把它灌入混凝土或石头上比头发丝还细的裂缝，能很快地渗入裂缝两侧三至六毫米，像铆钉一样把裂缝牢牢粘合。这种新产品，对维修混凝土的水利工程建筑、房屋、桥梁、铁道边坡、码头和石质古文物等等，具有重大的意义。
    参加试制甲凝的人员，平均年龄只有二十五岁。他们中间的多数人参加工作不久，对于生产化学灌浆材料毫无经验。由于帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义者对我国进行技术封锁，也没有任何资料可以参考。他们在进行工作中，国内某些资产阶级技术“权威”曾极力阻挠试验，说什么“外国搞了那么久，都没搞出什么名堂，你们能搞出个啥？”但是，这些阻力和工作中出现的无数困难，并没有把具有雄心壮志的革命者吓倒。参加试验的人员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢字当头，决心为中国人民争口气，赶超世界先进水平，坚持试验。
    甲凝化学灌浆材料的试验过程，就是试验人员活学活用毛主席著作的过程。开始，在北京的室内试验了九个月，进展不快，成绩不大。试验人员带着这个问题学习了毛主席的《实践论》，并遵照毛主席的教导，从一九六四年六月起，深入某水利工地，和工人一起，排除困难，进行了现场试验。
    甲凝化学灌浆材料既怕水，又怕氧。水会影响它的粘结程度，氧会使它发生爆聚现象。怎样解决这个问题呢？他们在试验中曾遭到失败。以后，他们学习了《实践论》《矛盾论》，从中得到很大启发，改变了过去只是孤立地、片面地从材料性能方面想办法的作法，大胆采取了把混凝土裂缝中的水和氧排掉、烘干的措施，使试验工作向前推进一大步。
    甲凝化学灌浆材料现场试验，只能在冬季低温条件下进行。试验人员和工人，为抢时间，争速度，尽管不是冬季，也打破常规，利用凌晨气温较低的时候，继续进行试验，从而积累了大量可靠的数据。
    甲凝化学灌浆材料终于试验成功了。可是，许多混凝土工程上的细微裂缝，一般在零点三毫米以下，没有专门的化学灌浆泵，甲凝仍然无法灌入。某水利工地党委把这项任务交给了自己的修配厂。这个修配厂规模小，设备差，完成任务困难很大。但是，参加试制化学灌浆泵的工人、技术人员和干部，学习了毛主席著作，解放了思想，发扬敢想、敢闯、敢革命的精神，实行“三结合”，经过一百多次反复试验，在二十多天内，就把我国第一台化学灌浆泵制造出来了，保证了甲凝化学灌浆材料及时地、大规模地应用于生产。
