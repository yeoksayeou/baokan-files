The sky and seas of our motherland sing the praises of young heroes. The glorious image of martyr Cai Yongxiang soars like a red seagull, forever in flight. The rushing waters and towering pines sing of the martyr who gave his life to defend the Red Guards. The heroic deeds stem from great thoughts; Cai Yongxiang is a role model for Red Guards! Ah, the iron Qiantang River Bridge stands tall, as if the hero is guarding it; the surging waters of the Qiantang River sing for the heroic soldier day and night. Ah, the nourishing rain of Chairman Mao's works has cultivated our young heroes, whose eighteen-year-old youth shines with the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. The People's Liberation Army loves the Red Guards, and the Red Guards learn from the PLA's example. Class solidarity runs deep as the sea, and revolutionary strength is as firm as steel! The train of the times is rushing forward, carrying the soldiers' thoughts to Beijing. Following the direction pointed by Chairman Mao, the red seagulls are soaring through the winds and clouds.
