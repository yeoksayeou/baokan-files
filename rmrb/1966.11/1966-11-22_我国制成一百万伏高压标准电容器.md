Workers at the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, break through foreign constraints, and forge their own path in industrial development. This capacitor is entirely made of domestic materials, has an advanced structure, reliable performance, and is on par with the world's advanced level.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Xi'an on the 21st, the revolutionary workers of the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory, with the heroic spirit of surpassing the Western bourgeoisie, recently successfully developed China's first one-million-volt high-voltage standard capacitor, which is on par with the world's advanced level. The workers proudly say: Mao Zedong Thought is the golden ladder to scaling the heights of science and technology. With Mao Zedong Thought, we dare to tread paths where predecessors have not ventured and dare to scale peaks where predecessors have not reached. We must race against time and leave the Western bourgeoisie far behind.

The one-million-volt high-voltage standard capacitor is an important device for measuring the electrical performance of ultra-high voltage electrical equipment, transformers, power cables, and conducting related scientific research. This equipment was developed during the peak of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, primarily by a group of ordinary workers and young, unknown technicians. The speed, quality, and level of this development are beyond the imagination of any bourgeois "authorities." From the start of the design to completion, it took only eleven months; and it was successfully assembled and tested on the first attempt. This new product, made entirely of domestic materials, has been evaluated as having an advanced structure, reliable performance, and is on par with the world's advanced level in the 1960s.

The birth of the one-million-volt high-voltage standard capacitor marks a significant leap forward in China's ultra-high voltage measurement technology equipment manufacturing, providing extremely favorable conditions for China's independent development of ultra-high voltage electrical products and equipment.

Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." To realize Chairman Mao's great call, we must not follow the old path of scientific and technological development of various countries, crawling step by step behind others. We must break through foreign constraints and forge our own path in industrial development, striving to catch up and surpass.

All revolutionary workers of the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, break through foreign constraints, and forge their own path in industrial development. The personnel involved in the development first organized to study Chairman Mao's works. Everyone discussed their thoughts, politics, and their boundless love for Chairman Mao, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify everyone's thinking. Everyone believed that the development team should not just be a simple technical team; it should first be an advanced collective that actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's works. The "three-in-one" team in the factory must first be unified by Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, the workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and other brilliant works, with their enthusiasm soaring higher and higher. Everyone, with boundless love, respect, and admiration for Chairman Mao, bravely marched towards the world's scientific peaks, racing against imperialism and revisionism for time and comparing heights.

Before this year's National Day, the product was fully installed and tested, completely meeting the specified requirements. During the development process, this factory received strong support from various relevant units in Xi'an, Shenyang, and other places.

    我国制成一百万伏高压标准电容器
    西安电力电容器厂职工，坚决听毛主席的话，打破洋框框，走自己工业发展的道路。这台电容器全部采用国产材料，结构先进，性能可靠，具有世界先进水平。
    据新华社西安二十一日电　西安电力电容器厂革命职工以立志超过西方资产阶级的英雄气概，最近试制成功具有世界先进水平的我国第一台一百万伏高压标准电容器。职工们自豪地说：毛泽东思想是攀登科学技术高峰的金梯，有了毛泽东思想，前人没有走过的路我们敢走，前人没有攀登过的高峰我们敢攀登。我们要和时间赛跑，把西方资产阶级远远地抛在后边。
    一百万伏高压标准电容器是测量超高压电器、变压器、电力电缆等产品电气性能和进行有关科学研究的重要设备。这台设备是在我国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，主要由一群普通工人和不知名的年轻技术员试制成功的。其进度之快，质量之好和水平之高，是任何资产阶级“权威”老爷们无法想像的。它从正式着手设计到制成，总共才花了十一个月时间；而且是一次装配，一次试验成功。这台全部采用国产材料制成的新产品，经过鉴定，认为结构先进，性能可靠，具有六十年代世界先进水平。
    一百万伏高压标准电容器的诞生，标志着我国超高压测量技术设备的制造水平又大大地向前跨进了一步，为我国独立发展超高压电器产品和设备提供了极为有利的条件。
    毛主席说：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”为了实现毛主席这一伟大号召，我们决不能走世界各国科学技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行，我们必须打破洋框框，走我国自己工业发展的道路，力争后来居上。
    西安电力电容器厂全体革命职工，坚决听毛主席的话，打破洋框框，走自己工业发展的道路。参加试制的人员首先组织起来学习毛主席著作，大家谈思想，谈政治，谈对毛主席的无限热爱，用毛泽东思想来统一大家的思想。大家认为，试制小组不应该是一个简单的技术小组，首先应该是一个活学活用毛主席著作的先进集体。工厂里的“三结合”小组，首先必须用毛泽东思想统一起来。就这样，职工们一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的“老三篇”和其他光辉著作，干劲一次比一次高涨。大家怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限崇拜的心情，勇敢地向世界科学高峰进军，和帝国主义、修正主义抢时间，比高低。
    今年国庆前夕，这台产品全部安装完毕，进行了试验，完全达到了规定的要求。在试制过程中，这个厂得到了西安、沈阳等地各有关单位的大力协助。
