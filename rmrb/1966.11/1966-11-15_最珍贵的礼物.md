We met two Red Guards from Beijing's Miyun County on the train back to our hometown from Beijing. We had a long chat about our experiences of linking up and shared our insights on studying Chairman Mao's works. During the conversation, I mentioned that I really wanted to buy a set of the four-volume "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

Upon hearing this, the two Red Guards eagerly said, "We have plenty of them where we come from." They generously promised to buy a set and send it to our school as soon as they got back home.

Not long after, I indeed received a letter and the four volumes from the two Red Guards in Beijing. When I opened the package, I couldn't help but shed tears, with a thousand words in my heart but unable to utter a single one.

What a precious gift! They, to help me master Mao Zedong Thought, sent the precious books to me from thousands of miles away. What is more valuable in the world than this revolutionary camaraderie? I must strive a hundredfold to study Chairman Mao's works well, to repay the most precious concern from these two unnamed classmates.

    最珍贵的礼物
    我们在从北京回家的火车上，遇到了北京市密云县的两个红卫兵。我们在一起漫谈了串连的经验，交流了学习毛主席著作的心得。交谈中，顺便谈到，自己很想买一套《毛泽东选集》四卷本。
    这两位红卫兵听我说完，热心地说：“我们那里正大量出售呢。”她们爽快地答应回家以后就给我买一套寄到我们学校。
    不久，我果然接到了这两位红卫兵从北京寄来的信和四卷宝书。当我打开纸包，禁不住眼泪夺眶而出，心里有千言万语，却一句也说不出来。
    这是多么珍贵的礼物呵！她们为了帮助我把毛泽东思想学到手，不远千里把宝书送到我手上。世界上还有什么东西比这种革命情谊更可贵的呢？我一定要百倍努力，学好毛主席著作，来回答这两位不知姓名的同学给我的最可贵的关怀。
