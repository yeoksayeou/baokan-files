Now, a large number of revolutionary students and Red Guards from various parts of the country have come to Beijing. What is Beijing's winter climate like? Here is a brief introduction, hoping that the revolutionary youngsters can, during their stay in Beijing, pay attention to their clothing and diet according to the weather changes, prevent diseases, and successfully complete their revolutionary linking-up tasks.

Beijing usually enters winter by the end of October, about a month earlier than the Yangtze River region. At this time, the average daily temperature is often below 10 degrees Celsius, and the lowest temperature can reach around -5 degrees Celsius. After that, the weather continues to get colder, and it is not until the end of March the following year that the temperature returns to the level of early winter, entering spring. Beijing's winter lasts about five months.

Due to the frequent southward movement of cold air from the Mongolian Plateau, November is the month with the most noticeable temperature drop in the entire year. By the end of November, the average daily temperature has dropped from around 10 degrees Celsius at the beginning of the month to 0 degrees Celsius, entering the coldest period. At this time, the lowest temperature can sometimes reach around -10 degrees Celsius.

Throughout December, Beijing is in the coldest period. The lowest temperature in the morning is often below -6 or -7 degrees Celsius, and after the invasion of cold air from the north, the lowest temperature can drop to below -10 degrees Celsius. The extreme lowest temperature in late December has reached -18 or -19 degrees Celsius.

January is the coldest month in Beijing, with the temperature mostly below 0 degrees Celsius for most of the time. Historically, there have been temperatures as low as -22.8 degrees Celsius. However, such cold weather only occurs after the rare invasion of a strong cold wave.

In February, Beijing begins to warm up, but it is still in the cold period. By March, the temperature rises more noticeably, and by the end of March, people already feel the arrival of spring.

Beijing is located on the main path of the southward-moving cold air from the north. The cold air from Mongolia that invades southward in winter often passes through the North China region, bringing dry and cold windy weather to Beijing. This dry cold air from the north sometimes has a relative humidity of only a few percent, feeling very dry. However, usually, the average relative humidity of the air is still around 50-60%, which is more humid than in spring.

Beijing's first snow usually falls in early November, but the total snowfall throughout the winter is very little, less than 5% of the annual total precipitation. Especially in December and January, the average monthly snowfall is only 2 or 3 millimeters. Therefore, Beijing's winter is often clear and sunny.

    同来京的革命小将们谈谈北京的冬季气候
    现在，从祖国各地来北京的外地革命师生和红卫兵人数很多。北京的冬季气候如何？这里作一简单介绍，希望革命小将们在留京期间，能够根据天气变化规律，注意自己的衣着饮食，防止发生疾病，以便胜利完成革命串连的任务。
    北京通常在十月底就开始进入冬季，比长江流域一带大约要早一个月。这时的日平均气温经常在摄氏十度以下，最低气温可达摄氏零下五度左右。此后，天气不断转寒，到第二年三月底，才能回复到初冬的程度而进入春季。北京冬季，大约长达五个月之久。
    由于蒙古高原上的冷空气频频南下，十一月是全年气温下降最明显的月份。到十一月末，日平均气温已从月初的摄氏十度左右降到零度，从而进入了严寒期。这时的最低气温，有时可达零下十度左右。
    整个十二月，北京都处在严寒期。早晨的最低气温经常在摄氏零下六七度以下，每当北方冷空气侵入以后，最低温度可降到摄氏零下十度以下。十二月下旬的极端最低气温，曾达零下十八九度。
    一月份是北京最寒冷的时期，大部时间的气温都在零度以下，历史上曾出现过摄氏零下二十二点八度的低温。不过这样寒冷的天气，只有历史上罕见的强大寒潮侵袭之后，才有可能出现。
    北京二月份开始回暖，但仍处在严寒时期；到三月份，气温才有比较明显的回升，三月底，人们已颇有春天的感觉了。
    北京处在北方南下的冷空气的主要通道上。冬季从蒙古高原向南方侵袭的冷空气，其主力经常经过华北地区，这时往往给北京带来干寒的大风天气。这种干寒的北方冷空气，其相对湿度有时只有百分之几，颇感干燥。但平时，空气的相对湿度平均仍可达百分之五六十，反比春季来得湿润。
    北京的初雪在十一月初，但整个冬季的降雪很少，还不到全年总降水量的百分之五。尤其在十二月和一月，平均月降雪量只有两三个毫米。所以，北京的冬季经常是晴朗天气。
