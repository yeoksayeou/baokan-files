Norman Bethune (1890–1939) was a member of the Communist Party of Canada. He was a renowned doctor who made significant contributions to the treatment and theory of tuberculosis and was one of the world's outstanding thoracic surgeons. However, he was not satisfied with his achievements. In pursuit of truth and a revolutionary path, he decided to dedicate his life to the revolutionary cause of the world's proletariat. He joined the Communist Party of Canada and became an excellent communist fighter.

In 1936, when the fascist bandits of Germany and Italy invaded Spain, Comrade Bethune, risking his life, led the Canadian Medical Team to Spain to actively serve the Spanish people who were bravely resisting fascism.

After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in our country in 1937, Comrade Bethune was dispatched by the Communist Party of Canada and the Communist Party of the USA, overcoming various difficulties, crossing the ocean, and leading a medical team to China to help the Chinese people's revolution. In April 1938, Comrade Bethune arrived in Yan'an. Soon, eager to work on the battlefield, he crossed the Yellow River and reached the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in mid-June, serving as the health advisor for the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region. In the early days of his work in the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, in addition to treating wounded soldiers, he actively worked on establishing a model hospital, setting an example for the border region's hospitals and training cadres. Later, he founded a specialized surgical hospital, promoting the further development of battlefield surgery in the border region at that time. In September 1938, when the enemy launched a "mopping-up" operation, he soon left the military region hospital to participate in frontline rescue work.

Comrade Bethune had no selfish motives and regarded the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. His internationalist and communist spirit became an excellent example for comrades to learn from. Comrade Bethune was extremely responsible for his work, extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people, and pursued perfection in medical technology. The military and civilians of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region who had personally received his treatment and seen his work were deeply moved.

In October 1939, when the enemy launched a "mopping-up" operation in the liberated areas, while he was busy performing surgery on wounded soldiers, his finger became infected with bacteria, and his condition rapidly worsened. Despite various rescue efforts, he unfortunately passed away on November 12 at the age of 50. Although Comrade Bethune has left us, his noble internationalist and communist spirit will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

    诺尔曼·白求恩
    诺尔曼·白求恩同志（一八九○年——一九三九年）是加拿大共产党党员。他是一个著名的医生，在肺结核的治疗和理论方面有很大贡献，是世界上卓越的胸外科专家之一。但是，他并不满足于自己所取得的成就。为了寻求真理，摸索一条革命的道路，他决心把自己毕生的精力献给世界无产阶级的革命事业。他参加了加拿大共产党，成为一个优秀的共产主义战士。
    一九三六年，当德意法西斯匪徒侵犯西班牙时，白求恩同志冒着生命危险，率领了加拿大医疗队到西班牙去，积极地为英勇反抗法西斯斗争的西班牙人民服务。
    一九三七年，我国抗日战争爆发后，白求恩同志又受加拿大共产党和美国共产党的派遣，克服了种种困难，远渡重洋，率领一个医疗队到中国来，帮助中国人民革命。一九三八年四月，白求恩同志到达延安。不久，他急于要到战地工作，就渡过黄河，于六月中旬到达远在敌人后方的晋察冀边区，任晋察冀军区的卫生顾问。他在晋察冀军区工作初期，除治疗伤员外，还积极从事于模范医院的建立，为边区的医院树立了榜样，培养了干部。后来又创办特种外科医院，推动了当时边区野战外科的进一步发展。一九三八年九月日寇发动“扫荡”，不久，他就离开军区医院到前线参加了战地救护工作。
    白求恩同志毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作自己的事业。他这种国际主义精神和共产主义精神成了同志们学习的好榜样。白求恩同志对工作极端的负责任，对同志对人民极端的热忱，对医疗技术精益求精。晋察冀边区的军民，凡亲身受过他的治疗和亲眼看过他的工作的，都非常感动。
    一九三九年十月，敌人向解放区进行“扫荡”，当他忙于为伤员作手术时，手指感染了毒菌，病势迅速恶化，用各种方法抢救无效，不幸于十一月十二日逝世，享年五十岁。白求恩同志虽然已经离开了我们，但他那种高尚的国际主义、共产主义精神，却永远活在中国人民和世界人民的心里。
