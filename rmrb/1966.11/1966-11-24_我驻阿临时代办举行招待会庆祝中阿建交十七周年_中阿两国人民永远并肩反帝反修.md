Chinese and Albanian Peoples Will Forever Stand Together Against Imperialism and Revisionism

	NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) — Wang Jinchuan, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, held a reception on the evening of the 22nd to celebrate the 17th anniversary of Sino-Albanian diplomatic relations (November 23).

	Albanian Foreign Minister Nesti Nas, Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Commission Prokop Murra, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army Dilaver Poci, Chairman of the Albanian Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee Mistre Treska, Deputy Minister of Trade Vasil Kati, and Deputy Minister of Industry and Mines Zenel Hamiti were invited to attend the reception. Also present were Chen Weiji, the leader of the Chinese Science and Technology Delegation visiting Albania, and Cai Yuren, the leader of the Chinese Journalists Delegation.

	At the reception, filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere, Wang Jinchuan and Nesti Nas both spoke. In their speeches, they highly praised the revolutionary friendship, combat unity, and brotherly relations between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of China and Albania, which have been continuously strengthened and developed over the past 17 years in their common cause and joint struggle. They expressed that the peoples of the two countries will continue to maintain and strengthen this great combat friendship, and will forever stand together in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and for the victory of Marxism-Leninism and communism in the world.

	Nas said in his speech, "The great and brilliant Chinese people, under the leadership of the long-tested Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong, have achieved brilliant achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The fraternal Chinese people, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, are now carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to further revolutionize national life, blocking the road to revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China. Great People's China today is an indestructible fortress of socialism, defending the peace of Asia and the world, a powerful and unshakable pillar of revolution, and a great example for the progressive and revolutionary peoples of the world."

	Wang Jinchuan pointed out in his speech that Comrade Mao Zedong's recent message to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and Comrade Enver Hoxha's enthusiastic praise and firm support for our party and people in this congress have elevated the friendship and unity between the two parties and the two countries to a new level. The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will forever follow the teachings of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, passing down our Marxist-Leninist friendship and unity from generation to generation, and forever standing together with the fraternal Albanian people. We will unite with all revolutionary peoples of the world, firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, support the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations, and fight to the end to overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries.

	The speeches by Wang Jinchuan and Nas were repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

	During the reception, the Chinese large-scale color stage documentary "The East Is Red" was screened.
