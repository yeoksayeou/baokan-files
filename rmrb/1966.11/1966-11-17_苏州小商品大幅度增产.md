The broad masses of handicraft workers and members of handicraft cooperatives in Suzhou City are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, seizing the revolution, and promoting production. This has led to a new wave of small commodity production in the city. From January to September this year, the city's production of small commodities, on the basis of two consecutive years of increased production, has increased by 27 percent compared to the same period last year. The production of cultural and educational supplies, daily-use hardware, wooden furniture, clothing and hats, plastic products, and other items has all seen significant increases. Product quality has also improved. At the same time, a large number of new products have been developed. Currently, this city has over 36,000 types of small commodities, which are sold throughout the country. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
