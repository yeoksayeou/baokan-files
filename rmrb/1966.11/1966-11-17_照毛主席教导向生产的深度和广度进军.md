Chairman Mao said: "Socialism not only frees the laborers and means of production from the old society, but also frees the vast natural world that the old society could not utilize. The people have boundless creativity. They can organize themselves, advance to every place and sector where they can exert their strength, march forward to the depth and breadth of production, and create more and more welfare for themselves."

Ten years ago, in his book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," Chairman Mao wrote a comment for the article "Excess Labor Force Finds an Outlet," which greatly inspired the cadres and members of Chenxi and Chendong Production Brigades in Feidong County, Anhui Province. They resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instructions, marching forward to the depth and breadth of production. Not only did they solve the problem of excess labor force, but they also achieved significant victories in developing production and consolidating the collective economy.

The predecessors of Chenxi and Chendong Production Brigades were the Qingchun and Chenci Agricultural Production Cooperatives. Ten years ago, when the cooperatives were first established, the advantages of collective organization began to emerge. Work that previously required three people could now be done by two, leaving one-third of the labor force idle. To solve this problem, they decided to adopt methods such as increasing agricultural production, applying more fertilizer, fine tillage, growing technical crops, and developing sideline production, thus providing an outlet for the excess labor force. The Feidong County Shitang District Committee of the Communist Party of China wrote the article "Excess Labor Force Finds an Outlet" in 1955, introducing their experiences.

Chairman Mao wrote a comment for this article, which greatly inspired the cadres and members of the two villages. They excitedly said: "Chairman Mao's instructions are like a guiding light, showing us a broad and smooth path." From that time on, they firmly followed Chairman Mao's instructions, leveraging the advantages of collective organization, relying on their own creativity, and marching forward to the depth and breadth of production.

To march forward to the depth and breadth of production, we must first have a collective economy as a guarantee. Due to severe natural disasters and the betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership, the national economy faced temporary difficulties. Some capitalists took the opportunity to stir up a wave of individual farming, aiming to dismantle the collective economy. At this critical juncture, the Party branch led the majority of poor and lower-middle peasants to resolutely fight against capitalist forces. Yellow Changfu, a poor peasant who had begged for food and worked as a laborer for over a decade before liberation, along with other poor peasants like Chen Jiafa, Chen Jiakuan, and Huang Changfu, became pillars in defending the collective economy. Huang Changfu, a poor peasant from Chenxi Production Brigade, rallied twelve households of poor and lower-middle peasants to join the fight. Through the struggle, they defended the collective economy, upheld the socialist direction, and provided a guarantee for marching forward to the depth and breadth of production.

To march forward to the depth and breadth of production, we must adopt new technologies and implement fine tillage; we must develop sideline production and practice diversified operations. However, class enemies seize every opportunity to stir up trouble. Some well-off middle peasants are also eager to take the capitalist road.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasant members resolutely fought back against the class enemies' attacks. One autumn, some poor and lower-middle peasant members conducted experiments in rice fields to control stem borers with pesticides. Class enemies spread rumors saying, "Stem borers are divine insects; the more you treat them, the more they multiply." The members on the field immediately exposed their sabotage activities. That evening, the production brigade held a members' meeting to expose the enemies' plots, introduce the benefits of using pesticides to control stem borers, and give the members a vivid class education. Poor and lower-middle peasant members said: "Everything the Party and Chairman Mao say is the truth. We must never forget class struggle; class enemies must work honestly and are not allowed to spread rumors and cause trouble."

They also conducted reasoning struggles against some well-off middle peasants who ran private tofu shops and other sideline businesses for speculation. For a period, they specifically studied the Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee communiqué, Chairman Mao's instructions on class and class struggle, and Chairman Mao's comment for the article "Excess Labor Force Finds an Outlet," and held a great debate on this issue. Chen Jiafa, a poor peasant from Chendong Production Brigade, said at the members' meeting: "Chairman Mao teaches us to organize ourselves and march forward to the depth and breadth of production. Yet, some people want to take the capitalist road; we firmly do not agree. We must follow Chairman Mao's words; whatever Chairman Mao instructs, we will do. We will develop the collective economy and resolutely take the socialist road." After this great debate, the members' enthusiasm for developing collective production soared.

Over the past ten years, the cadres and members of these two production brigades have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, marching forward to the depth and breadth of production and achieving tremendous results. They have vigorously developed water conservancy projects, making 478 mu of farmland all-weather harvest fields. Under the gradually improving water conservancy conditions, they have carefully cultivated the land, applied more fertilizer, reformed the cultivation system, practiced intercropping, and reclaimed wasteland. In 1966, the total grain output of the two brigades was more than double that of 1955. In recent years, they have annually delivered large quantities of grain and cotton to the state.

The water area here is not small; they raise fish and ducks in over 60 mu of water, plant lotus roots and water chestnuts, and also raise pigs, operate tofu and starch mills. Diversified operations have gone from nonexistent to thriving. Now, there are eight types of sideline businesses, with the output value accounting for about one-third of the total agricultural and sideline output value, making the entire collective economy continuously develop and grow stronger.

The cadres and members of the two brigades, looking back on the journey of the past ten years, all believe that the victories achieved in these ten years are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the socialist direction, and march forward to the depth and breadth of production, we will achieve even greater victories.

### 照毛主席教导向生产的深度和广度进军

    照毛主席教导向生产的深度和广度进军
    毛主席说：“社会主义不仅从旧社会解放了劳动者和生产资料，也解放了旧社会所无法利用的广大的自然界。人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”
    毛主席十年前在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中为《多余劳动力找到了出路》一文所写的按语，极大地鼓舞了安徽省肥东县解集公社陈西、陈东两个生产队的干部和社员。他们坚决地执行毛主席的指示，向生产的深度和广度进军，不仅解决了多余劳动力的问题，而且在发展生产上、在巩固集体经济上取得了重大的胜利。
    陈西、陈东两个生产队的前身是青春、陈祠两个农业生产合作社。十年以前，合作社初成立，组织起来的优越性开始发挥，过去三个人做的工作，合作化以后两个人做就行了，多余了三分之一的劳动力。为解决这个问题，他们决定采取农业生产多加工施肥、精耕细作，多种技术作物，发展副业生产等办法，使多余的劳动力基本上有了出路。中共肥东县石塘区委员会于一九五五年写了《多余劳动力找到了出路》这篇文章，介绍了他们的经验。
    毛主席为这篇文章写了按语，使两个村子的干部、社员受到极大鼓舞。他们兴奋地说：“毛主席的指示像指路明灯，给我们指引了一条康庄大道。”从这时候开始，他们坚定地按照毛主席的指示，发挥组织起来的优越性，依靠自己的创造力，向生产的深度和广度进军。
    向生产的深度和广度进军，必须首先有集体经济作保证。由于严重的自然灾害和苏修领导集团的背信弃义，国家经济出现了暂时的困难。有些资本主义分子乘机活动，刮起了一股单干风，要搞垮集体经济。在这严重的关头，党支部领导绝大多数贫农下中农，与资本主义势力作坚决的斗争。解放前讨过饭、帮工十多年的贫农黄昌福，贫农陈家发、陈家宽、黄昌甫等许多人，成了维护集体经济的顶梁柱。陈西生产队贫农黄昌甫串连了十二户贫农和下中农，一道起来斗争。经过斗争，他们保卫了集体经济，坚持了社会主义方向，为向生产的深度和广度进军提供了保证。
    向生产的深度和广度进军，必须采用新技术，实行精耕细作；必须发展副业生产，实行多种经营。可是，阶级敌人一遇机会，就兴风作浪。少数富裕中农也热中于走资本主义道路。
    广大贫农下中农社员，对阶级敌人的进攻，进行了坚决的回击。有一年秋天，一些贫农下中农社员在水稻田里进行用农药防治螟虫的试验。阶级敌人就造谣说：“螟虫是神虫，越治越多。”在田间的社员当场揭穿了他的破坏活动。当天晚上，生产队又召开社员大会，揭露敌人的阴谋，介绍了用药剂治螟的好处，使社员上了一次生动的阶级教育课。贫下中农社员说：党和毛主席讲的句句是真理，我们千万不能忘记阶级斗争，只许阶级敌人老老实实地劳动，不让他们乱说乱动。
    他们对一些搞私人豆腐坊等副业，进行投机倒把的富裕中农，也进行了说理斗争。有一个时期，他们专门学习了党的八届十中全会公报，毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的指示，以及毛主席为《多余劳动力找到了出路》一文写的按语，并就这个问题展开了大辩论。陈东生产队贫农陈家发在社员大会上说：“毛主席教导我们组织起来，向生产的深度和广度进军。可是，有的人竟想走资本主义道路，我们坚决不答应。我们要听毛主席的话，毛主席怎样指示，我们就怎样做，我们要发展集体经济，坚决走社会主义道路。”社员们经过这场大辩论，发展集体生产的积极性更加高涨。
    这两个生产队的干部和社员，十年来按照毛主席的教导，向生产的深度和广度进军，取得了巨大的成绩。他们大力兴修水利，使四百七十八亩耕地全部成了旱涝保收的农田。在水利逐渐改善的条件下，精心耕作，增施肥料，改革耕作制度，实行套种间种，并且开垦荒地。一九六六年，两个队的粮食总产量比一九五五年增加了一倍多。近几年来，他们每年向国家交售大批粮食和皮棉。
    这里水面面积不小，他们在六十多亩水面放养鱼、鸭，种植菱、藕，另外，还养猪，开豆腐坊和粉坊。多种经营从无到有，从小到大。现在共有了八种副业，产值约占农副业总产值的三分之一，使整个集体经济不断发展壮大。
    两个队的干部社员回顾十年来走过的路程，都认为十年所取得的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。今后只要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持社会主义方向，向生产的深度和广度进军，就会取得更大的胜利。
