Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, October 31st: More than 600,000 people from various circles in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City held a solemn memorial meeting today to mourn Cai Yongxiang, a selfless communist warrior, a hero in the mold of Ou Yanghai, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, and a loyal defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and out-of-town Red Guards and revolutionary students who came to Hangzhou for revolutionary linkages, as well as Cao Xiangren, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, Wu Xian, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor of Zhejiang Province, Long Qian, responsible person of the Zhejiang Military Region, Wang Zida, Deputy Secretary of the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee and Mayor of Hangzhou City, and other party, government, and military leaders attended the memorial meeting.

Also present were Lin Weixian, responsible person of the Nanjing Military Region, and Li Mingzhe, representative of the Ministry of Railways.

Xiong Chuanzhong, Deputy County Magistrate of Feidong County, Anhui Province, the hometown of Cai Yongxiang, Cai Baoyu, the father of the martyr, Cai Yongsheng, the second elder brother of the martyr, and Lian Peizhao, the platoon leader of the unit where the martyr served, also attended the memorial meeting.

The memorial meeting began at 9:00 AM. The entire audience stood in solemn silence and recited Chairman Mao’s quotations: “To struggle is to sacrifice. Death is a common occurrence. But we think of the interests of the people, of the sufferings of the great majority of the people, and we are ready to shed our blood and sacrifice our lives. To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai. But to strive for the people’s interests, for the interests of the great majority of the people, to die for the people’s interests—that is weightier than Mount Tai.” They then sang in unison a song with lyrics based on Chairman Mao’s quotation, “To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai.”

Long Qian, responsible person of the Zhejiang Military Region, delivered the eulogy. He said, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is surging forward. Domestic and foreign class enemies are trying every means to sabotage this great revolutionary movement. At a critical moment when a special train for Red Guards encountered a sudden danger, Cai Yongxiang, fearless and selfless, removed obstacles and foiled the class enemies’ political plot. He sacrificed his young life to protect the vital transportation link, the Qianjiang Bridge, to protect the Red Guards going to Beijing to receive Chairman Mao’s inspection, and to protect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao said, “To die for the people’s interests is weightier than Mount Tai.” Cai Yongxiang died for the highest interests of the people. His death is weightier than Mount Tai. We are proud and honored to have such a great warrior.

Long Qian said, Cai Yongxiang had Mao Zedong Thought engraved in his mind, studied Mao Zedong Thought diligently, practiced Mao Zedong Thought, and vowed to defend Mao Zedong Thought with his life. His heroic image will forever live in our hearts, and his brilliant thoughts and lofty qualities will forever be our examples to learn from.

Wu Xian, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor of Zhejiang Province, said in his speech, Cai Yongxiang’s heroic deeds vividly prove that the People’s Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao, is a great school and a great smelting furnace. It is the best place to educate people, temper people, and raise people’s consciousness. Cai Yongxiang has set a shining example of a communist warrior for us. All the people of the province should learn well from the heroic Cai Yongxiang. We must be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people; we must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao’s call to promote the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao’s works to a new stage; we must follow Chairman Mao’s words, serve the people wholeheartedly, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Lin Weixian, responsible person of the Nanjing Military Region, announced at the memorial meeting the decision of the Nanjing Military Region Party Committee to posthumously recognize Cai Yongxiang as a formal member of the Communist Party of China and award him the First-Class Merit. He expressed deep sorrow on behalf of the Nanjing Military Region Party Committee and all the officers and soldiers to the martyr Cai Yongxiang and extended deep condolences to the martyr’s family. He said, Cai Yongxiang is indeed a hero of the great era of Mao Zedong, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, and a good son of the people. He called on the troops to learn from Cai Yongxiang’s activities, resolutely implement Comrade Lin Biao’s instructions to promote the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao’s works to a new stage, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deepen the feelings of studying Chairman Mao’s works, create a stronger atmosphere of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, and work harder on transforming one’s worldview. We must truly master and grasp Mao Zedong Thought and turn our troops into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. We must strive for greater victories in China’s socialist revolution and socialist construction, for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, for resolutely opposing American imperialist aggression, for resolutely opposing modern revisionism, for resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people’s struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and for the world revolution, and for the ultimate victory of the great cause of communism.

Shen Youxin, a representative of the Red Guards and revolutionary students, said at the meeting: Cai Yongxiang sacrificed his young life to protect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The glorious name of Cai Yongxiang will forever be engraved in the hearts of us Red Guards and revolutionary students. His heroic deeds will forever inspire us, educate us, and drive us forward on the great road of Mao Zedong Thought. We will learn from the hero, never forget class struggle, and forever follow Chairman Mao in the great waves of class struggle.

Cai Baoyu, the father of the martyr Cai Yongxiang, an old poor peasant who suffered deeply in the old society, spoke emotionally at the meeting. He thanked the Party and Chairman Mao for cultivating his son into a good soldier of Chairman Mao and a good son of the people. He said, I lost a good son, but seeing everyone learning from him, I feel honored and happy. I will definitely educate his elder brother and younger brother to be like him, read Chairman Mao’s books, listen to Chairman Mao’s words, and act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Although my wife and I are old, we will read Chairman Mao’s books for life, listen to Chairman Mao’s words for life, and execute Chairman Mao’s instructions for life. We will follow the revolutionary road pointed out by Chairman Mao for generations to come.

Cai Yongsheng, the second elder brother of Cai Yongxiang, wrote a letter of determination with tears of joy after learning of his younger brother’s sacrifice for the revolution, resolutely requesting to enlist and carry on his younger brother’s revolutionary cause, forever following Chairman Mao to make the revolution. This 20-year-old youth made another request to enlist at the memorial meeting today. The military leadership announced the approval of his request at the meeting. Cai Yongsheng immediately put on a new olive-green military uniform. Then, He Yiqian, responsible person of the Zhejiang Military Region, presented Cai Yongsheng with “Selected Readings from Mao Zedong’s Works,” “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” and a gun. Cai Yongsheng expressed his determination to enlist, resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao’s call, study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. At this moment, the audience was deeply moved, shouting: “Learn from the good soldier of Chairman Mao, Cai Yongxiang!” “Learn from Cai Yongxiang’s great communist spirit!” “Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!” “Long live the great Communist Party of China!” “Long live, long live, and ten thousand years live the great leader Chairman Mao!”

Today, Li Mingzhe, Wang Zida, Xiong Chuanzhong, Lian Peizhao, and provincial and municipal representatives Chen Yousheng also spoke at the memorial meeting. They all expressed their determination to learn from the hero, be like the hero, learn from the People’s Liberation Army, and ensure that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally led by Chairman Mao, is carried through to the end.

    蔡永祥烈士的父亲蔡宝余，这个在旧社会苦大仇深的老贫农社员，激动地在会上讲了话。他在讲话中感谢党和毛主席把他儿子培养成为毛主席的好战士、人民的好儿子。他说，我失去了一个好儿子，但看到大家都在向他学习，我感到光荣和高兴。我一定要教育他哥哥和他弟弟像他那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。我和他妈妈虽然都是上了年纪的人，但是毛主席的书，我们要读一辈子，毛主席的话，我们要听一辈子，毛主席的指示，我们要执行一辈子，毛主席指出的革命道路，我们要千年万代走下去。
    蔡永祥的二哥蔡永胜，得到弟弟为革命牺牲的消息后，曾含着热泪写下了决心书坚决要求入伍，继承弟弟的革命遗志，永远跟着毛主席干革命。这个二十岁的青年，今天在追悼大会上，再一次提出入伍请求。部队领导机关在会上宣布批准了他的要求。蔡永胜当场穿上崭新的草绿色军装。接着，浙江省军区负责人何以祥把《毛泽东著作选读》、《毛主席语录》和一支枪发给了蔡永胜。蔡永胜表示，入伍以后，一定像弟弟一样，坚决响应林彪同志号召，活学活用毛主席著作，做毛主席的好战士。这时，会场群情激动，高呼：“向毛主席的好战士蔡永祥同志学习！”“学习蔡永祥同志伟大的共产主义精神！”
