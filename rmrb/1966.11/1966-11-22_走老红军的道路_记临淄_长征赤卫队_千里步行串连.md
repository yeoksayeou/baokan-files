**Editor's Note:** The news that our great leader Chairman Mao supports the Red Guards and revolutionary students in long-distance marches has greatly inspired the revolutionary youth across the country. Revolutionary students and teachers are actively conducting pilot long-distance marches. The experience of the "Long March Red Guards" from Jingzhong Agricultural Middle School, which we introduce today, is worth reading.

The "Long March Red Guards" are most worthy of learning from because they voluntarily endure hardships and labor; they voluntarily follow the three main disciplines and eight points for attention, blending with the masses; they voluntarily use the advanced deeds of the working-class and peasantry and the communist spirit to examine their own thoughts, promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts. This is the result of their practice in the struggle, insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and is the result of their strict self-discipline, taking revolutionary predecessors as examples.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has led the Chinese people in decades of arduous revolutionary struggles and personally led the Red Army on the unprecedented Long March of 25,000 li, cultivating a large number of cadres for the Chinese revolution. Today, our great commander Chairman Mao once again calls on revolutionary youths to conduct long-distance marches, showing great concern and expectations for the growth of revolutionary youth. Revolutionary youths should raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and more consciously roll in the mud of the people's struggles thousands of times, forging themselves into steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Among the students and teachers who marched to Beijing, there is a small team consisting of thirteen youths. In late October, they set out with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "weathering storms and seeing the world," crossing mountains and rivers, and marching over a thousand li. On the day after they arrived in the capital, they happened to attend Chairman Mao's sixth reception of revolutionary students and teachers from various places. They spent more than seven hours happily on the reviewing stand in front of the great leader. This small team is the "Long March Red Guards" from Jingzhong Agricultural Middle School in Linzi County, Shandong Province.

**Personally Tasting the Hardships of Revolutionary Predecessors**

Hardship and fatigue are the first obstacles in long-distance marches. The youths of the "Long March Red Guards" face them with one word: struggle! They rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the heroic spirit of the Red Army's "not fearing the difficulties of the long march," and firmly resolve to be the red successors of the old Red Army, overcoming one difficulty after another.

To cultivate the spirit of enduring hardships and labor, they often voluntarily seek out difficulties. Starting from the departure, they originally planned to set out during the day, but later felt that night marches would be more beneficial for their training, so they chose to depart at night. To learn from the old Red Army's practice of cooking on the march, they brought their own food and cooking utensils.

That night, each of them carried a backpack weighing about twenty jin, pulled a ground cart with marching pots and enough food for a month, and set out in the night. The youths walked with high and low steps, covering forty to fifty li in one breath. Some had swollen ankles, and some felt their legs were filled with lead. Just at this time, they encountered a section of road under repair, and each step sank into half a chi of muddy water. Should they continue or not? Some hesitated. At this moment, the political instructor led everyone in reciting Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely carry out the decision, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The propagandist directed everyone to sing in unison: "...you young people...like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. The hope is placed on you." The great Mao Zedong Thought gave everyone immense courage and strength. The youths were spirited, taking big steps, pulling the ground cart, shouting the slogan "Persistence is victory," and advancing bravely again.

That night, the youths marched about a hundred li. When the sun rose, although they were very tired, their spirits were high. They lined up in neat rows, singing "The East is Red, the Sun Rises...", and triumphantly arrived at the first campsite.

The victory of the initial march encouraged the youths to face more arduous tests with unwavering confidence. One dawn, just as they were about to set out, it suddenly started raining, and a cold wave from the north made the temperature drop suddenly. Local community members suggested they wait until the rain stopped, but the youths excitedly said: "This is a great opportunity for us to train!" They wrapped Chairman Mao's works with raincoats, braved the storm, and set out on the march again. The rain fell heavier; the wind, from level four or five, gradually increased to level eight or nine. The ground cart, which usually required two people to pull, now needed five or six people to pull and push, and every step forward required great effort. They fought bravely against the wind and rain, encouraging each other: "If we can't endure a little wind and rain from nature, how can we withstand the storms of class struggle? How can we carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end?!"

At noon one day, they arrived at a vast saline-alkali depression, with no villages within forty to fifty li. They set up their pots and stoves on the saline-alkali land, using firewood picked up along the way and water from a nearby river, to boil water and cook. The water boiled, but when everyone scooped it to drink, it tasted salty and bitter. Someone looked at the bucket of water and shook their head. Seeing this, the political instructor told everyone a story about the Red Army eating grass roots and tree bark during the Long March, meaningfully saying: "Comrades, today's water is not very good to drink, but compared to the hardships our revolutionary predecessors endured, it is still much sweeter!" These words made everyone happy. The youths talked and laughed, drank the bitter water, and had their meal. Later, a female student deeply felt: "We, who have grown up drinking sweet water, if we do not personally taste the hardships our revolutionary predecessors endured, how can we understand that happy life does not come easily?!"

**We Are the People's Servants**

"Respect the masses, unite with the masses, propagate among the masses, and help the masses do everything possible, so that the masses feel that the students educated by Chairman Mao serve the people and revolution everywhere." This is a task that the "Long March Red Guards" set for themselves in their manifesto, and it is something they learn from the old Red Army. They said it, and they did it.

Before setting out, the youths discussed: What meaningful gifts should they send to the people along the way? The result of the discussion was that they used the income from their labor-study program to buy more than 1,200 copies of Chairman Mao's selected works. Chairman Mao's books are the lifeblood of the working people and the priceless treasure of the revolution! The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses along the way, receiving this batch of precious gifts from their hands, were all overjoyed and deeply moved!

The youths propagated Mao Zedong Thought and the Party Central Committee's Sixteen Points along the way. They propagated in one village, one household; they helped production teams put up blackboard newspapers, studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with community members, and taught peasants to sing songs composed with Chairman Mao's quotations.

Along the way, the youths, taking Lei Feng as an example, voluntarily did many good deeds for the masses. Whenever they arrived at a place, no matter how tired they were, they would put down their backpacks and go to draw water, cut hair, and sweep the courtyards for the poor and lower-middle peasants and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers.

One day, when they arrived at the campsite, they were already very tired and sleepy. The community members let them rest and even hid the brooms and water buckets, not telling them where the well was. They did not rest but went everywhere looking for sweeping and water-drawing tools. An old woman saw the youths sweeping her alley and wanted to enter her courtyard to sweep, so she tried every means to stop them. The youths had to leave temporarily to sweep other courtyards. Soon, the youths rushed back into the old woman's door, sweeping her courtyard clean.

Zhang Hongjie, who was in charge of voluntary haircutting, once saw a herdsman with very long hair and crawled into the herdsman's shed to ask him to come out for a haircut. The old herdsman knew they were very tired on the road and repeatedly declined. Zhang Hongjie persuaded him again and again, and the old man finally agreed. After the haircut, the old man held his hand, excitedly saying: "You are truly Chairman Mao's good students!"

In this way, the youths used their limited rest time to draw water for 650-plus poor and lower-middle peasant households, sweep courtyards, and cut hair for 130-plus people.

**Strictly Observing the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention**

On the march, the youths took the PLA as an example, strictly observing the three main disciplines and eight points for attention. They said: "We are the people's servants, with only the duty to serve the people, and no right to harm the people's interests!"

Drinking a cup of boiled water, the youths would pay for the tea; even if they were thirsty to the point of smoking, they would not pluck a single radish by the roadside.

When passing through a village in Bin County, the youths stayed at the home of an old man surnamed Zhao, burning a few bundles of firewood. They paid for the firewood according to the price, but Old Man Zhao refused to accept it. The next day, when they were about to leave, they secretly placed the money under an oil lamp. However, when they had walked four or five li, Old Man Zhao caught up with them on a bicycle. His eyes were filled with tears, and he said excitedly in a reproaching tone: "Burning a few bundles of firewood, and you are still so formal, truly not understanding the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants!" The youths were deeply moved, but they still patiently explained: "We are Chairman Mao's Little Red Guards, the reserve army of the PLA. We appreciate your kindness, but we cannot violate the three main disciplines and eight points for attention!" Old Man Zhao had no choice but to accept the money. When the youths had walked far away, he was still standing in the original place, waving his hand.

The youths specially prepared a notebook, and whenever they arrived at a village, they would ask the local production team and community members to criticize and give opinions. However, from the thick notebook, people saw only such warm words of praise: "Promising!" "Truly Chairman Mao's Little Red Guards!"

**Reflecting on the Way, Transforming Thoughts**

On the Long March, the youths humbly learned the excellent qualities of the working-class and peasantry, absorbing nutrients from them. They often compared their thoughts with the advanced deeds of the working-class and peasantry, promoting their own thought transformation. They said: This is Chairman Mao's teaching, and this is the example set by the old Red Army and the PLA for us.

After setting out, they saw that every household had posters of Chairman Mao, and in the fields and work sites, there were posters of Chairman Mao's quotations everywhere. Some community members recited Chairman Mao's quotations more fluently than they did. The thick political atmosphere in the vast rural areas and the high learning enthusiasm of the working-class and peasantry shocked the youths' thoughts. Before setting out, some students thought they might be better at studying Chairman Mao's works than peasants; now, after comparing, they only felt their faces burning. "If we do not strive, we will fall far behind!" This was the common feeling of the youths. "Catch up and never fall behind!" This was their unanimous resolution. They seriously examined themselves and quickly put it into action. On the way, they tested each other on reciting Chairman Mao's quotations; upon arriving at the campsite, they insisted on writing study notes. Learning and applying as they went, they saw immediate effects.

The deep class feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants for Chairman Mao, and their advanced deeds of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, deeply educated and influenced the youths.

One night, the youths stayed in Renmin Production Brigade of Chengguan Commune, Bin County. When the community members knew they were going to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, they were all excited. An old poor peasant in his seventies, wearing old glasses, wrote a letter under the dim oil lamp all night, asking them to take it to Chairman Mao. The next morning before dawn, he came to see them off and repeatedly instructed: "When you reach Tiananmen, please shout 'Long live Chairman Mao' for this old poor peasant a few more times! His longevity is the greatest blessing for us poor and lower-middle peasants!" In another village called Zhifang Brigade, female students were embroidering a banner to present to Chairman Mao by the lamp. Several poor peasant women knew about it and insisted on embroidering together. While embroidering, they also said deeply: "Stitch by stitch, thread by thread, also embroidering our poor and lower-middle peasants' love for the great leader!"

Every time they arrived at a village, as soon as they put down their backpacks, many poor and lower-middle peasants came to ask about their health and busily helped to cook. One night, the youths, because they were too tired, did not tidy up the marching cart and went to sleep. The next morning at dawn, they found the pots and bellows already placed on the cart. Lifting the pot lid, they found it still filled with half a pot of red dates. The youths were so moved that they almost cried. Another time, the youths took a wrong path, and the local people led them, walking more than ten li of winding paths, all the way sending them onto the main road. Every time they thanked the poor and lower-middle peasants, the community members would say: This is Chairman Mao's teaching. You should thank Chairman Mao!

"How have we done ourselves?" In front of the clear mirror of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the youths repeatedly compared themselves, asking themselves. Some said: "Chairman Mao teaches us to be extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people. This sentence has been read countless times, but compared to the poor and lower-middle peasants, the gap is too great." They resolved to have more contact with the masses, serve the people better, and thoroughly transform their thoughts and feelings with Mao Zedong Thought, forging themselves into truly qualified red successors of the old Red Army!

    走老红军的道路
    ——记临淄“长征赤卫队”千里步行串连
    编者按：我们伟大领袖毛主席支持红卫兵和革命师生步行串连的喜讯，给了全国各地革命小将极大的鼓舞。广大革命师生正在积极进行长征式步行串连的试点。今天本报介绍的敬仲农业中学“长征赤卫队”的经验，值得一读。
    “长征赤卫队”最值得学习的是，他们自觉地吃大苦耐大劳；自觉地遵守三大纪律八项注意，和群众打成一片；自觉地用工农群众的先进事迹和共产主义风格对照检查自己的思想，促进思想革命化。这是他们在实践斗争中，坚持活学活用毛主席著作的结果，是他们处处以革命前辈为榜样，严格要求自己的结果。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席领导中国人民进行了几十年艰苦卓绝的革命斗争，并亲自率领红军进行了史无前例的二万五千里长征，为中国革命事业培养了一大批骨干。今天，我们伟大的统帅毛主席又号召革命小将们进行长征式的全程步行串连，对革命青少年的成长寄予了极大的关怀和期望。革命小将们应该更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更自觉地在群众斗争的泥巴里滚过千百次，把自己锤炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    在步行来京串连的革命师生中，有一支由十三名小将组成的小分队。十月下旬，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱，遵循毛主席“经风雨，见世面”的教导，跋山涉水，步行一千多里。到首都的第二天，就赶上毛主席第六次接见各地革命师生。他们在观礼台上，在伟大领袖跟前，幸福地度过七个多小时。这支小分队，就是山东临淄县敬仲农业中学的“长征赤卫队”。
        亲自尝尝革命前辈吃过的苦
    苦和累，是步行串连的头一个拦路虎。“长征赤卫队”的小将们对待它的态度是一个字：斗！他们依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，学习“红军不怕远征难”的英雄气魄，抱定做老红军的红色接班人的坚强决心，斗倒了一个又一个的困难。
    他们为了锻炼吃大苦耐大劳的精神，常常自觉地找困难。就从出征说起吧。原先他们是打算白天启程的，后来觉得夜行军对自己锻炼更大，就找了个夜晚出发。为了学习老红军在行军过程中埋锅做饭，就自带粮食和炊事用具。
    那天晚上，他们每人背起一二十斤重的背包，用地排车拉着行军锅灶和够吃一个来月的粮食，连夜出发了。小将们高一脚低一脚，一气走了四五十里路。有的人脚脖子肿了，有的人腿像灌了铅。偏偏在这个时候，遇上一段正在翻修的公路，一迈脚就陷进半尺多深的泥水里。走还是不走呢？有人犹豫起来。这时候，大家选的政治辅导员领着背诵毛主席语录：
  “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”宣传员指挥大家齐声高唱：“……你们青年人……好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”伟大的毛泽东思想给了大家无比的勇气和力量。小将们精神抖擞，迈着大步，拉着地排车，喊着“坚持就是胜利”的口号，又奋勇前进了。
    这一夜，小将们走了一百来里。当一轮红日冉冉升起的时候，一个个虽然很劳累，情绪却很饱满。他们排着整齐的队形，高唱“东方红，太阳升……”，胜利地到达了第一个宿营地。
    初征的胜利，鼓舞着小将们信心百倍地去迎接更艰苦的考验。一天拂晓，正当他们整装待发的时候，突然下起雨来，加上寒潮南下，天气骤然变冷。当地社员群众建议他们雨停了再走，小将们却兴奋地说：“这正是我们锻炼的好机会！”他们用雨布裹好毛主席著作，冒着狂风暴雨，又踏上了征途。雨，越下越急；风力，由四五级逐渐增大到八九级。平常只要两个人拉的地排车，现在五六个人又拉又推，每前进一步都要费很大力气。他们斗志昂扬地同风雨搏斗着，并且互相鼓励：“这么一点自然界的风雨都受不了，怎么能抗住阶级斗争的大风雨，怎么能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底呢？！”
    一天晌午时分，他们来到了一片荒碱大洼，周围四五十里没有村庄。他们就在盐碱地上，支起锅灶，用沿途拾来的柴禾，从附近取来河水，烧水做饭。水烧开了，可是，当大家舀来喝的时候，水味发咸发苦。有人看着这桶水直摇头。看到这情景，政治辅导员给大家讲了一段红军在长征途中吃草根吃树皮的故事，意味深长地说：“同学们，今天的水不大好喝，可是跟革命前辈们吃过的苦比起来，还是甜得多呢！”一席话，说得大家高兴起来。小将们又说又笑，喝着苦水，吃了这顿饭。事后一位女同学深有感触地说：“我们这些喝甜水长大的年青人，不亲自尝尝革命前辈吃过的苦，怎能理解幸福生活来之不易啊！”
        “我们是人民的勤务员”
    “要尊重群众，联系群众，宣传群众，帮助群众做一切可能做到的事情，让群众感到毛主席教育的学生，处处为人民服务，处处为革命。”这是“长征赤卫队”在宣言书里给自己规定的一项任务，这是他们向老红军学习的一项内容。他们这样说了，也是这样做的。
    出征前，小将们商议着：给沿途群众送点什么有意义的礼物呢？商议的结果，他们用勤工俭学的收入，买了一千二百多本毛主席著作单行本。毛主席的书是劳动人民的命根子，是革命的无价之宝啊！沿途的贫下中农和革命群众，从他们手里接过这批珍贵的礼物，一个个莫不欢天喜地，激动万分！
    小将们沿途宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党中央的十六条。他们到一村，宣传一村；到一户，宣传一户。有的帮助生产队出黑板报，有的和社员一起学习《毛主席语录》，有的教农民唱用毛主席语录谱写的歌曲。
    一路上，小将们以雷锋为榜样，自觉地为群众做了大量好事。他们每到一地，无论多么劳累，背包一放，就去给贫下中农和烈军属挑水，理发，扫院子。
    有一天，他们到达宿营地的时候，已经又困又累。社员让他们休息，并且把扫帚、水桶藏起来，还故意不告诉他们水井在哪里。他们没有休息，而是到处去找扫地、打水用具。有一位老大娘，看到小将们给她扫了胡同，还要进门给她扫院子，就想方设法劝阻他们。小将们只得暂时离开，去扫别的院子。不一会，小将们又拥进大娘的门来，把她家的院子打扫得干干净净。
    担任义务理发员的张洪杰同学，有一次看到一位饲养员头发很长，便钻进饲养棚去请他出来理发。这位老饲养员知道他们一路很劳累，便再三谢绝。张洪杰一再劝说，老人总算答应了。理完发，老人拉着他的手，激动地说：“你们真是毛主席的好学生！”
    就这样，小将们利用有限的休息时间，给六百五十多户贫下中农挑了水，扫了院子，给一百三十多个人理了发。
        严格遵守三大纪律八项注意
    在征途中，小将们处处以解放军为榜样，严格遵守三大纪律八项注意。他们说：“我们是人民的勤务员，只有为人民服务的义务，没有损害群众利益的权利！”
    喝杯开水，小将们要付茶水费；路边种着水萝卜，即使渴得喉头冒烟，也没人去拔一个。
    路过滨县一个村庄时，小将们住在一位姓赵的大爷家里，烧了他家几把柴草。他们照价付给柴火费，赵大爷说什么也不肯收。第二天临走的时候，他们偷偷地把钱压在一盏煤油灯下。可是，当他们走出四五里路，赵大爷骑着自行车赶上来了。他眼里闪着晶莹的泪花，用责备的口吻激动地说：“烧几根柴禾，你们还这样见外，真是太不了解咱贫下中农的心了！”小将们深受感动，但是，他们还是耐心地解释说：“我们是毛主席的红小兵，是解放军的后备军，我们感谢您的盛意，可我们不能违犯三大纪律八项注意啊！”赵大爷听了，只得把钱收下。当小将们走出很远，他还站在原地不住地挥手。
    小将们专门备了一个本子，每到一村，都要请当地生产队和社员群众，对他们提批评和意见。但是，从厚厚的本子上，人们看到的都是这样一些热情的赞语：“有出息！”“真是毛主席的红小兵！”
      一路“照镜子”，一路改造思想
    长征路上，小将们虚心学习工农群众的优秀品质，从工农群众中吸收养料。他们经常对照工农群众的先进事迹检查自己的思想，促进自己的思想改造。他们说：这是毛主席的教导，这是老红军、解放军为我们做出的样子。
    出发以后，他们看到家家户户张贴着毛主席像，田间、工地，到处插着毛主席语录牌。有些社员背诵毛主席语录，比他们还熟。广大农村浓厚的政治空气，工农群众高涨的学习热情，使小将们思想上大受震动。出发之前，有的同学曾经以为自己学习毛主席著作，可能比农民好一些；如今一对比，只觉得脸上火辣辣的。“再不努力，就要大大落后了！”这是小将们的共同感受。“迎头赶上，决不掉队！”这是大家的一致决心。他们认真作了检查，并且迅速落实到行动上。走在路上，互相测验背诵毛主席语录；到达宿营地，坚持写学习笔记。边学边用，收到了立竿见影的效果。
    贫下中农对毛主席的无比深厚的阶级感情，贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作的先进事迹，深深地教育和感染着小将们。
    一天晚上，小将们住在滨县城关公社人民生产大队。当社员们知道他们是上北京看望毛主席的，一个个兴奋异常。一位七十多岁的老贫农，戴着老花眼镜，在昏暗的油灯下，连夜写了一封信，托他们捎给毛主席。第二天天不亮，又赶来送行，并且一再叮嘱：“到了天安门，可要替我这个老贫农，多喊几声‘毛主席万岁’啊！他老人家万寿无疆，就是我们贫下中农的最大的福气！”在另一个叫纸坊大队的村子里，女同学正在灯下绣一面献给毛主席的锦旗，几位贫农妇女知道了，硬是争着要一起绣。一边绣，一边还深情地说：“一针针，一线线，也绣上我们贫下中农对伟大领袖的热爱！”
    他们每到一村，背包刚刚放下，就有许多贫下中农来问寒问暖，忙着帮助烧火做饭。有天晚上，小将们因为太疲劳，没有收拾好行军车，便躺下睡觉了。第二天拂晓起来，锅灶，风箱，早安放在车上了。一揭锅盖，里面还盛着大半锅红枣。小将们感动得几乎流下泪来。还有一次，小将们走差了道，当地群众领着他们，走了十多里崎岖小道，一直把他们送上大路。每当他们向贫下中农道谢的时候，社员们总是说：这是毛主席的教导。你们要谢，还是感谢毛主席他老人家吧！
      “我们自己做得怎样呢？”在贫下中农这面通明透亮的镜子面前，小将们一再对照自己，反问自己。有的说：“毛主席教导我们，对同志对人民要极端热忱。这句话念过不知多少遍，和贫下中农一对比，做的就差得太远了。”他们决心更多地接触群众，更好地为人民服务，用毛泽东思想彻底改造自己的思想感情，把自己锻炼成真正够格的老红军的红色接班人！
