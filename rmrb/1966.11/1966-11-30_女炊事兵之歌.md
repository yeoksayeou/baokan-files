In a telephone company of the Shenyang Military Region, there is a female cooking squad. Whenever people pass by their kitchen, they always hear the bold song "I Am a Cook." How did this song come about? It's quite a story!

Last autumn, Wang Yiweng, Zhang Lianrong, Chang Chunju, Gao Guijin, Yin Yanzhen, and Huang Shunxin, six female soldiers, became the cooks of this company.

At the farewell meeting, the Party branch gave them copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," instructing them to turn the cooking squad into a classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought. Comrades pinned big red flowers on them, dressed them in white uniforms, and sent them off to the kitchen with drums and gongs. The female cooks stood tall and sang "I Am a Cook"!

Singing is easy, but doing is hard. These female cooks were originally city students, aged only eighteen or nineteen, with the oldest being just twenty-one. They had always eaten ready-made meals at home and had no idea how to cook for a hundred people. However, squad leader Wang Yiweng didn't care about any of that. This sturdy, outgoing, and straightforward Communist Party member had a fearless spirit. She rolled up her sleeves and led everyone into battle.

Unfortunately, the first pot of rice didn't pass inspection: some were raw, some burnt, some dry, some watery—it was a mess. For a while, the female cooks worked through the night, exhausted and struggling to get into bed; some had cut their hands four or five times, with many small wounds, and the alkali in the dough stung like mad. Besides all that, if the comrades couldn't eat well, that was a big problem! At this point, laughter in the kitchen became scarce, and no one sang "I Am a Cook" anymore.

With the help of the Party branch, the female cooks re-studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." They thought, in the face of difficulties, if one wavers, it's not because of technical issues but because one's resolve and spirit of serving the people are not strong enough. Zhang Lianrong said, "Both my mother and I have spent our lives around the stove, but the meaning is different. Before, she cooked for the family; now, I cook for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution." Everyone decided to broaden their scope of service to the people and cleanse their minds of selfish thoughts.

After that, the song "I Am a Cook" echoed from the kitchen again.

Sometimes, if they made burnt or undercooked rice, the cooking squad would keep the leftovers for themselves to eat; if there was not enough food, they would rather go hungry themselves to ensure the comrades ate their fill. To improve living conditions, they walked seven or eight miles to grind rice. Soon, they learned the "quick cooking method," able to cook a meal in just an hour. At this point, comrades praised them, saying they were almost as good as veteran cooks.

After passing the food inspection, the cooking squad started a revolution on the stove. They said, "If we don't pay attention to saving coal, a year's worth of coal could be wasted up the chimney." After studying Chairman Mao's teaching, "Save every penny for the war and revolutionary cause," they further realized that saving coal also required a broad vision for the country and the world.

Where to save coal? The cooking squad studied "On Contradiction" and found that the main contradiction was the firewood problem, and the principal aspect of the contradiction was the person tending the fire. Huang Shunxin, who tended the fire, said, "Yes, I am the principal aspect of the contradiction!"

After a period of experimentation, Huang Shunxin not only mastered the rules of tending the fire but also, together with other comrades, worked during the day and improved the stove at night, modifying it thirty-one times. Finally, the cooking squad reduced the coal consumption for the entire company to about three taels per person per day. This revolutionary young pioneer, who had been in the army for less than two years, joined the Communist Party of China. Comrades affectionately called her "Huang Satisfied."

The comrades in the cooking squad were not satisfied with these achievements. They decided to become all-around cooks. Once, during a festival, the company planned to slaughter two pigs. At first, everyone was at a loss—pigs had to be slaughtered to be eaten! But then they thought, since they were cooks, they should be able to do everything, so what was the big deal about slaughtering pigs! Wang Yiweng volunteered, "I'll do it!" The quartermaster shook his head, and cooks from other companies came to watch the spectacle. Wang Yiweng thought of battle: American devils were bigger than pigs, so why not dare to slaughter them? With that thought, she rolled up her sleeves and gave a fierce chop. Due to the force, the knife slipped and hit the bone, causing the pig to scream and struggle. The quartermaster feared she couldn't handle it and wanted to replace her. Wang Yiweng thought, this is also a revolution; if it were Chiang Kai-shek or American devils, wouldn't she dare to slaughter them? She eased the knife and gave another chop, and the pig was slaughtered. After this, many people volunteered to learn how to slaughter pigs.

In the past, buying grain and coal required a truck, which was wasteful and troublesome. The cooking squad decided to use tricycles instead of trucks. The first to learn to ride a tricycle was squad leader Wang Yiweng. She had just learned to ride a bit wobbly when she rode the tricycle to the street to buy vegetables.

That day, the street was busy with people and vehicles. Children and adults saw a young female soldier riding a tricycle and came to watch. Little Wang panicked and, while turning a corner, the tricycle flipped over.

Back at the company, someone called her the "King of Acrobatics." Wang Yiweng steeled her heart and thought, so what if I ride a tricycle! This is also about breaking old customs and establishing new ones.

Later, she specifically went to crowded places to practice, although she flipped the tricycle a few more times, she still learned to ride. All the comrades in the squad also learned to ride tricycles. Once, they carried seven or eight hundred pounds and rode for dozens of miles without any problem.

The comrades in the cooking squad did not become arrogant with their achievements. They came out of the "small classroom" and went into the "big world" to face wind and rain, gain experience, and decided to temper themselves into revolutionaries with strong bones.

This April, even though it was still quite cold in Northeast China, the unit went out for labor. The cooking squad volunteered to send four people to cook for over a hundred people.

The kitchen there was a tent set up in the wilderness, open on three sides. The first thing they did upon arrival was to paste several copies of Chairman Mao's quotations inside the tent and write them on the stove.

At that time, the weather was very cold, and the radish strips froze as soon as they were cut. A brother unit had prepared a blower, but they said, "During war, can we prepare a blower?" They did not use it. A few people gathered together, facing the quotations in the tent, as if Chairman Mao were right in front of them, and their bodies gained boundless strength.

While cooking, the fire tender Huang Shunxin knelt on the ground, blowing on the fire with her mouth when it was small, her face blackened, tears streaming down, thawing the frozen soil, her clothes covered in wet mud, but she did not move. Finally, they cooked the meal.

After the labor ended, on the way back, comrades saw that the cooking squad was very tired and wanted them to ride in the car; but they did not ride in the car and insisted on marching with the unit.

The six female cooks all became model soldiers. The cooking squad was rated as a model canteen. Squad leader Wang Yiweng also attended the Shenyang Military Region's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works. But they had not finished singing their song "I Am a Cook." They decided to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively for life, ride the wind and waves, and march forward forever!

    女炊事兵之歌
    施兆平　关景杰
    沈阳部队一个电话兵连里，有个女炊事班。每当人们路过她们的伙房，总会听到《我是一个炊事员》的豪迈歌声。这支歌是怎么唱起来的呢？说起来，还有一段曲折哩！
    去年初秋，王宜文、张连荣、常春菊、高桂琴、尹彦珍、黄顺新这六个女兵当上了这个连的女炊事员。
    欢送会上，党支部给她们发了《毛主席语录》，嘱咐她们要把炊事班办成学习毛泽东思想的大课堂。同志们给她们戴上大红花，穿上雪白的工作服，敲锣打鼓地送她们进伙房。几个女炊事兵挺着胸膛，《我是一个炊事员》唱起来啦！
    唱起来容易做起来难。这些女炊事兵原来都是城市里的学生，年龄只有十八、九岁，最大的也不过二十一岁，在家尽吃现成饭，根本不知道这百十来号人的饭菜该怎么做。可是，班长王宜文不管那一套，这个身材壮实、性格爽朗、作风泼辣的共产党员，有股子天不怕、地不怕的闯劲儿，捋胳膊，挽袖子，就领着大家上阵干起来了。
    没想到，第一锅饭就没过关：生的、糊的、干的、稀的，弄了个五、六样。开始一个时期，女炊事兵们披星星，戴月亮，累得上床都费劲儿；有的手上挨了四、五刀，裂了很多小口子，和面时碱水一泡，钻心疼。这些不说，同志们吃不好可是大事啊！这时候，伙房里的笑声少了，《我是一个炊事员》也没人唱了。
    在党支部的帮助下，几个女炊事兵重新学习了《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》。她们想，在困难面前动摇，不是技术不行，是自己的锻炼决心、为人民服务的思想不过硬。张连荣同志说：“我和我妈都是围着锅台转，但转的意义可不同。从前，她是为家里转；现在，我是为中国革命、世界革命转。”大家表示，要把为人民服务的尺寸放得长长的，把私心杂念挖得净净的。
    从那以后，《我是一个炊事员》的歌声，又从伙房里传出来了。
    有的时候，做出了糊饭或夹生饭，炊事班就把剩下的留给自己吃；饭少了，宁肯自己挨饿，让同志们吃饱。为了改善生活，她们走出七、八里地推磨碾米。不久，学会了“快速做饭法”，一小时之内，就能把饭做出来。这时，同志们都夸她们快赶上老师傅的水平了。
    饭菜过了关，炊事班又在炉灶上闹革命。大家说，不注意节约煤，一年就会从烟囱里跑掉一口大肥猪。学习了毛主席“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，……”的教导，她们进一步认识到，节煤也要胸怀祖国，放眼世界。
    从哪儿节煤呢？炊事班学习了《矛盾论》，找到了主要矛盾是烧火问题，矛盾的主要方面是烧火的人。烧火的黄顺新同志说：
  “对！我就是矛盾的主要方面！”
    经过一段时间的摸索，黄顺新不但掌握了烧火的规律，而且还和其他同志一起，白天做饭，晚上改灶，一连改了三十一次，终于使全连的炊事用煤，每人每天下降到三两左右。这个不到十九岁的革命小闯将，入伍不到两年，就加入了中国共产党。同志们都亲切地管她叫
  “黄满意”。
    炊事班的同志并不满足这些，她们决心当个什么都能干的炊事兵。有次过节日，连里准备杀两口猪。开始大家都为难了，猪不杀不能吃啊！又一想，既然当炊事员，就什么都能干才行，杀猪有什么难的！王宜文自告奋勇地说：“我干！”司务长听了直摇头，别的连的炊事员也来看热闹。王宜文同志就往打仗上想：美国鬼子比猪个儿还大，敢不敢杀呀，当然敢！想到这儿，她一捋胳膊，上去狠狠给了一刀。由于用力过猛，刀子一偏，扎到骨头上了，猪一个劲儿叫喊、挣扎，司务长怕她不行，要换她。王宜文想，这也是革命，要是蒋介石、美国鬼子的脑袋，还能不杀吗？刀子一缓，又给了一下子，猪杀死了。在这以后，很多人都抢着学杀猪。
    过去，买粮、买煤，都要用汽车，浪费大，麻烦多，炊事班想用三轮车代替汽车。第一个学蹬三轮车的是班长王宜文，她刚会歪歪扭扭的骑一点儿，就骑车上街去买菜。
    这天，街上车马行人很多，大人小孩见一个年轻女兵蹬三轮，都过来瞧热闹。小王一慌，拐弯的时候，车子来了个大翻身。
    回来，有人说她是“杂技大王”。王宜文心一横，管它呢，三轮车骑定了！这也是破旧俗，立新风嘛。
    后来，她专门到人多的地方去练，虽然又翻了几次车，还是学会了。全班同志也都蹬开了三轮车。一次拉个七、八百斤，走它几十里地也不在话下了。
    炊事班的同志，有了成绩不骄傲。她们从“小课堂”走出来，到“大天地”里经风雨，见世面，决心为革命炼就一身硬骨头。
    今年四月，东北还是挺冷的时节，部队外出劳动。炊事班主动要求去四个人，承做一百多人的饭菜。
    那里的伙房，是一个搭在野外、三面透风的帐篷。她们到这儿的第一件事，是把十几条毛主席语录，贴在帐篷里，写在锅台上。
    当时，天气很冷，萝卜条切出来就上冻了。兄弟连队原来准备了一台吹风机，她们说，“打仗的时候，难道还能准备上一台吹风机吗？”没有用它。几个人凑在一起，面对帐篷上的语录，好像毛主席就在眼前，身上增添了无穷的力量。
    做饭的时候，烧火的黄顺新，跪在地上，火小了就用嘴吹，脸上熏黑了，眼泪一个劲儿淌，冻土都被她暖化了，衣服上沾满了湿泥，可她一动都不动。大家终于把饭做好了。
    劳动结束，回来的时候，同志们看炊事班很辛苦，要求她们坐车走；但她们不坐车，坚决跟着部队步行上了路。
    六个女炊事兵，个个当上了五好战士。炊事班被评为五好食堂。班长王宜文，还出席了沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议。可她们《我是一个炊事员》的歌子还没有唱完，她们决心一辈子活学活用毛主席著作，乘风破浪，永远前进！
