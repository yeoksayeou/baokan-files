The Japanese edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" has been published in Tokyo and received a warm welcome.

Japanese friends say: We also want to carry "Quotations" with us like the Chinese people, study it well, and study it every day.

A Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tokyo reports: The Japanese edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" has recently been published in Tokyo and has been enthusiastically welcomed by a wide readership in Japan.

The Japanese edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was translated and published by the "Mao Zedong Quotations Study Group," organized by Japanese Socialist Party friends who visited China this summer, to meet the demand of the broad masses of the Japanese people for studying Chairman Mao's works.

The book includes all the contents of the Chinese edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," with a red cover. The frontispiece also features a photograph of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. Before the main text of the quotations, there is a photograph of Mao Zedong's close comrade-in-arms, Lin Biao, and Lin Biao's inscription: "Study Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

In the preface to the book, Japanese friends from the "Mao Zedong Quotations Study Group" wrote: Mao Zedong Thought today shines like a star, illuminating the entire world.

Within a few days of its publication, the first print run of 50,000 copies was pre-ordered by thousands of bookstores. A major bookstore in Tokyo, which restocked twice in three days, saw all copies sold out. Currently, readers in various cities outside Tokyo, Osaka, and Kitakyushu are writing to publishers in Tokyo to purchase the book and are willing to pay for the postage themselves.

Several readers who have just purchased "Quotations from Chairman Mao" said: We have been eagerly awaiting this book. We also want to carry it with us like the revolutionary masses in China and study it well, every day. (Accompanying picture)
