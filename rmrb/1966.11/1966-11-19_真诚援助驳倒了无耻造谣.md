Sincere Aid Refutes Shameless Slander

The imperialists of the United States and their lackeys have been continuously slandering China. However, the facts known to all are: it is not China that interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, but the American Johnson.

Your country has provided us with unconditional and interest-free aid; this has, in practice, refuted the slander of the American imperialists and the French and British colonialists. Their loans, which come with high interest rates, cannot compare with China's aid.

    真诚援助驳倒了无耻造谣
    美帝国主义和它的走狗不断对中国进行诽谤。但是，人所共见的事实是：干涉别国内政的并不是中国，而是美国佬约翰逊。
    你们国家给我们提供无条件、无偿的援助；这就在实际上驳斥了美国佬和法英殖民主义者的造谣。他们附有很高利息的贷款是不能和中国的援助相比的。　刚果（布）　毕龙盖·保尔
