Zhou Yang says that to implement the "Two Hundred" policy, "the first issue is to create a democratic atmosphere." However, what frustrates Zhou Yang is that, reportedly, there is still an atmosphere in today's society that hinders the implementation of the "Two Hundred" policy. This is the atmosphere of "dogmatism, sectarianism, and bureaucratic administrative command methods in dealing with scientific and artistic work." In Zhou Yang's view, with these atmospheres, the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of scientists and artists will be suppressed and frustrated, "flowers will not bloom, and may even wither," truly a heinous crime.

In the socialist era, who feels the atmosphere is "oppressive" and "uncomfortable"? It is only a small group of reactionary classes and their intellectuals who have been overthrown by the people. If these people feel the atmosphere is "oppressive" and "uncomfortable," that's great in the eyes of revolutionary people. With their "comfortable feelings," there will be no comfort for us. Only by suppressing their dark winds and evil spirits can socialist flowers breathe fresh air. For anti-party and anti-socialist weeds, not only should they feel "oppressed," but they should not even get a bit of "air," making them all "wither"!

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, Zhou Yang's gang's dream of restoring capitalism is difficult to realize. Therefore, Zhou Yang fiercely attacks Chairman Mao's literary line, cursing the party's leadership of literary work as "feudal patriarchal rule," and so on. He wants to overturn the lifeline of our proletarian literature and "create" an atmosphere conducive to the spread of weeds and the movement of ghosts and demons.

For more than a decade, Zhou Yang's gang has been implementing bourgeois dictatorship in the literary world, making the entire literary world chaotic. Anti-party and anti-socialist bad films, bad plays, bad articles have emerged one after another, while revolutionary modern dramas and heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers have been beaten down by the "formulaic" and "conceptual" sticks. It can be seen that Zhou Yang is "boosting" the morale of anti-party and anti-socialist elements and "inflating" the "political zombies" that have already been overthrown by the people. At the same time, it is also releasing "cold air" into the socialist garden and "poisonous gas" into the revolutionary people.

"Air" is very important. The proletariat needs to create a revolutionary atmosphere, and the bourgeoisie and revisionists also need to create a counter-revolutionary atmosphere. The "air" that Zhou Yang is grasping is to replace the proletarian and socialist atmosphere with a bourgeois and revisionist atmosphere. This "air" makes weeds grow everywhere when inhaled, and flowers wilt when inhaled. If we let this "air" fill today's society, our country will change color! In this current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must sweep away the evil winds and spirits of Zhou Yang's gang, make the air of studying Mao Zedong Thought thick, and make the political air of the proletariat thick!

    周扬要“创造”什么样的“空气”
    班长　张宗荣
    周扬说，贯彻“二百”方针，“头一个问题，就是创造民主的空气”。可是，使周扬恼火的是，据说今天社会上还有一种阻碍贯彻“二百”方针的“空气”，这就是“教条主义、宗派主义和对待科学艺术工作的官僚主义的行政命令方法。”照周扬看来，有了这些“空气”，科学家、艺术家的积极性、主动性、创造性就会受到压抑、挫折，“花就放不出来，甚至还会枯萎”，真可谓是“罪大恶极”了。
    在社会主义时代，什么人感到空气“压抑”，“心情不舒畅”呢？只是一小撮被人民专了政的反动阶级和他们的知识分子。让他们这些人感到空气“压抑”，“心情不舒畅”，在我们革命人民看来好得很。有了他们的“心情舒畅”，就没有我们的心情舒畅。只有把他们那股黑风妖气压下去，社会主义的百花才能得到新鲜的空气。对于反党反社会主义的毒草，不仅要使它们感到“压抑”，而且连一点“空气”也不能给它们，叫它们统统“枯萎”！
    在无产阶级专政的条件下，周扬一伙复辟资本主义的梦想是很难实现的。因此，周扬才疯狂地攻击毛主席的文艺路线，咒骂党对文艺工作的领导是“封建家长统治”等等。他想反掉我们无产阶级文艺的命根子，“创造”出一种有利于毒草泛滥，有利于牛鬼蛇神蠢动的“空气”。
    十几年来，周扬一伙在文艺界实行着资产阶级专政，把整个文艺界搞得乌烟瘴气：反党反社会主义的坏电影、坏戏、坏文章，纷纷出笼，革命现代剧、工农兵英雄形象，被“公式化”、“概念化”几条棍子打得抬不起头来。可见，周扬是在给那些反党反社会主义分子打“气”，给那些早被人民打倒了的“政治僵尸”灌“气”。同时，也是在向社会主义花圃大放“冷气”，向革命人民大放“毒气”。
    “空气”很重要。无产阶级需要创造革命的“空气”，资产阶级、修正主义也需要创造反革命的“空气”。周扬抓的“空气”，就是要以资产阶级、修正主义的“空气”来代替无产阶级、社会主义的“空气”。这种“空气”，毒草吸了四处丛生，香花吸了就要枯萎。如果让他这种“空气”充满今天的社会，我们的国家就会变颜色！在当前这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要横扫周扬一伙的妖风邪气，把学习毛泽东思想的空气搞得浓浓的，把无产阶级的政治空气搞得浓浓的！
