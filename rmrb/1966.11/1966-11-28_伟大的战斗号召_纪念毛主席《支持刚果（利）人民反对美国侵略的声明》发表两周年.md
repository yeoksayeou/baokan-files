Two years ago, at the critical moment when U.S. imperialism was launching a military invasion of the Congo (Leopoldville), our great leader Chairman Mao issued an important declaration.

Chairman Mao's declaration is a great call to arms for all the people of the world to stand up against U.S. imperialism. This call to arms has dealt a heavy blow to the arrogance of U.S. imperialism, strongly supported the just struggle of the Congolese people, and boosted the fighting spirit of all oppressed peoples of the world. It has pointed out the direction of their struggle and enhanced their confidence in victory.

Chairman Mao said: "All the people of the world, unite! Oppose the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world should dare to struggle, dare to win! The people of the world are invincible!"

U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of all the people of the world. It kills and burns wherever it goes, acting arrogantly and committing all sorts of evil deeds. It looks frightening, but it is actually nothing to be afraid of. The more you fear it, the more ferocious it becomes. If you do not fear it, dare to provoke it, dare to confront it, dare to fight it, this ferocious beast of U.S. imperialism will be subdued and defeated. In the face of revolutionary people who dare to fight, U.S. imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger.

Imperialism and all reactionaries rely on what to bully and oppress people? In a word, they hold knives in their hands. U.S. imperialism is the same. It invades and enslaves the world, relying solely on its bayonets, its guns, and its entire war machine. Therefore, the oppressed people who want to resist U.S. imperialism and achieve a thorough victory in the revolution must also take up arms. This is the great truth of Marxism-Leninism and the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao has always taught us that if the enemy holds a knife, we must also take up a knife. Chairman Mao said: "Seeing that others have something in their hands, we must investigate what it is. What is it? It's a knife. What is the use of a knife? It can kill people. Who does he want to kill with the knife? He wants to kill the people. After investigating these matters, investigate further: The Chinese people also have hands and can hold knives. If there are no knives, we can make some. The Chinese people, after long-term investigation and research, have discovered this truth. War lords, landlords, local tyrants and evil gentry, imperialists, all hold knives in their hands and want to kill people. The people have understood this and will act accordingly."

All oppressed nations and peoples, as long as they understand this truth, their revolutionary cause will have genuine hope. As long as they have the courage to fight, dare to take up arms if they have none, learn to fight if they do not know how, establish revolutionary bases if they have none, and gradually develop and strengthen their forces, no matter how ferocious the enemy is, no matter how many difficulties, obstacles, twists, and turns, and failures they encounter on the revolutionary path, the spark will eventually become a prairie fire, and the revolutionary people will ultimately achieve final victory.

A few years ago, U.S. imperialism assassinated the Congolese national hero Lumumba, overthrew the legal government of the Congo (Leopoldville), and subsequently carried out naked military intervention, causing the Congolese national independence movement to suffer a serious setback. However, the Congolese people have paid a bloody price and learned a bitter lesson. They resolutely took up arms and, on the vast plains of their own country, launched a heroic armed struggle. From then on, the Congolese people found the path to victory and liberation.

The heroic Vietnamese people, fearing neither heaven nor earth, fought bravely and grew stronger, making hundreds of thousands of U.S. aggressor troops suffer in the flames of people's war. The great struggle of the Vietnamese people in resisting U.S. aggressor bandits has set a heart-stirring example for the oppressed peoples of all countries.

The aggression of U.S. imperialism has met with the brave resistance of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the brave resistance of the peoples of all countries in the world. U.S. imperialism has fallen into the encirclement of the peoples of the world.

What U.S. imperialism fears most is the awakening of the peoples of all countries, especially when the peoples of all countries take up arms and engage in long-term struggle against it. U.S. imperialism is using every means to try to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the peoples of all countries, but the result is only to promote the awakening of the peoples of all countries and force them to take the path of armed struggle. Every place U.S. imperialism invades, it puts a noose around its own neck.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, pursuing the policy of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," has become an accomplice of U.S. imperialism in suppressing the revolutionary movements of the peoples of all countries. However, this gang of traitors cannot help U.S. imperialism, nor can they stop the revolutionary tide of the peoples of all countries. Our era is a new era of world revolution. The struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries is rising like a storm, swift and irresistible, and cannot be stopped.

Chairman Mao's declaration "Support the Congolese People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression" is a great battle call to the peoples of the world and a scientific prophecy about the future of the world revolution. This prophecy is being realized step by step through the revolutionary practices of the peoples of all countries. The lifespan of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries will not be long. They will all be overthrown, defeated, and annihilated by the revolutionary peoples. In the end, the peoples of all countries will lose an old world in the great revolutionary struggle and gain a brilliant new world. The world should belong to the people, and it will definitely belong to the people!

    伟大的战斗号召
    ——纪念毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》发表两周年
    东明
    两年以前，正当美帝国主义武装侵略刚果（利）的严重时刻，我们伟大的领袖毛主席发表了一个重要声明。
    毛主席的声明，是号召全世界人民起来反对美帝国主义的一篇伟大的檄文。这篇檄文，沉重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略气焰，有力地支持了刚果（利）人民的正义斗争，振奋了全世界被压迫人民的战斗精神，指出了他们的斗争方向，提高了他们的胜利信心。
    毛主席说：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。它到处杀人放火，横行霸道，干尽了坏事。看样子吓人，其实没有什么了不起。你越是怕它，它就越凶。你不怕它，敢于惹它，敢于碰它，敢于顶它，敢于同它交锋，敢于同它搏斗，美帝国主义这只张牙舞爪的野兽，就会被制服，被打败。在敢于战斗的革命人民面前，美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎。
    帝国主义和一切反动派，靠什么来欺侮人、压迫人呢？归结成一句话，就是他们的手里拿着刀。美帝国主义也是这样。它在全世界进行侵略和奴役，无非就是靠它的刺刀，靠它的枪炮，靠它的全套战争机器。因此，被压迫的人民要反抗美帝国主义，要取得革命的彻底胜利，就必须自己也拿起武器来。这是马克思列宁主义的伟大真理，是毛泽东思想的伟大真理。
    毛主席一向教导我们，敌人手里拿着刀，我们也要拿起刀来。毛主席说：“看到人家手里拿着东西了，我们就要调查一下。他手里拿的是什么？是刀。刀有什么用处？可以杀人。他要拿刀杀谁？要杀人民。调查了这几件事，再调查一下：中国人民也有手，也可以拿刀，没有刀可以打一把。中国人民经过长期的调查研究，发现了这个真理。军阀、地主、土豪劣绅、帝国主义，手里都拿着刀，要杀人。人民懂得了，就照样办理。”
    一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民，只要懂得了这一条真理，他们的革命事业就有了真正的希望。只要有勇气，敢于战斗，没有武器可以拿起武器，不会打仗可以学会打仗，没有革命根据地可以建立革命根据地，力量弱小可以逐步发展壮大。不管敌人多么凶恶，不管在革命的征途上会遇到多少艰难险阻、曲折和失败，星星之火终将燎原，革命人民终将取得最后胜利。
    几年前，美帝国主义谋杀了刚果（利）民族英雄卢蒙巴，颠覆了刚果（利）的合法政府，以后又一再进行赤裸裸的武装干涉，使刚果（利）民族独立运动遭到了严重的挫折。然而，刚果（利）人民付出了血的代价，吸取了沉痛的教训。他们坚决地拿起武器，在自己祖国辽阔的原野上，展开了英勇的武装斗争。从此，刚果（利）人民就找到了走向胜利、走向解放的光明道路。
    英雄的越南人民，不怕天，不怕地，越战越勇，越战越强，使几十万美国侵略军在人民战争的烈火中烧得焦头烂额。越南人民英勇抗击美国侵略强盗的伟大战斗，给各国被压迫人民树立了一个振奋人心的榜样。
    美帝国主义的侵略，遭到了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的英勇抵抗，遭到了世界各国人民的英勇抵抗。美帝国主义已陷入世界人民的重重包围之中。
    美帝国主义最害怕的是各国人民的觉悟，特别是各国人民拿起武器，同它展开长期的战斗。美帝国主义千方百计地企图扑灭各国人民的革命烈火，其结果只能促进各国人民的觉悟，并且迫使各国人民走上武装斗争的道路。美帝国主义每侵略一个地方，就把一条绞索套上它自己的脖子。
    苏联修正主义领导集团推行“美苏合作主宰世界”的政策，充当了美帝国主义镇压各国人民革命运动的帮凶。但是，这伙叛徒帮不了美帝国主义的忙，阻挡不住各国人民革命斗争的洪流。我们的时代，是世界革命的一个新时代。反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，正在全世界范围内兴起，其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，不可抵挡。
    毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》，是向全世界人民发出的一个伟大的战斗号召，也是对于世界革命前途的科学预言。这个预言，正在通过各国人民的革命实践，一步一步地变为现实。帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派的寿命，不会很长了。它们通通将被革命人民所推翻，所打倒，所消灭。归根结底，各国人民在伟大的革命斗争中，失去的将是一个旧世界，赢得的将是一个光辉灿烂的新世界。全世界应当属于人民，也一定属于人民！
