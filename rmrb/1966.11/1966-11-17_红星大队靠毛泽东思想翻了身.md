Mao Zedong said: "Can the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country keep pace with the progress of national industrialization? Can the cooperative movement develop healthily, with fewer problems and guaranteed increases in production? It all depends on whether the leading cadres at various levels can quickly and correctly shift their focus to this aspect. ... In this county in Guizhou, since December 1954, when they changed their work attitude, they have achieved great results in just over five months. They did not rely on work teams but took the initiative themselves, and the Party members were no longer afraid of difficulties."

The current Red Star Production Brigade of Yong'an Commune was part of Chongxin Township in the former Fenggang County, Guizhou Province. Over the past ten years, the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and their spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes, with production increasing year by year. When the commune members talk about the ten-year transformation of "Red Star," they all unanimously say, "Water has a source, trees have roots; Mao Zedong Thought has turned 'Red Star' around."

In 1962, this area suffered a severe natural disaster, and class enemies took the opportunity to stir up trouble, spreading a wind of individual farming. At this time, the Party branch of the Red Star Brigade organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's comments on the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Chongxin Township. Through the study, people's minds became clear. Some said, "Chairman Mao's instructions are our compass, and the socialist direction indicated by the compass must not be changed!" Others said, "The land reform confiscated the landlords' land, but it did not confiscate their brains, and they will always try to sabotage." At this time, the resolution of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was transmitted, and the Party branch immediately shifted its focus to class struggle, leading the masses to repel the class enemies' fierce attacks, and making the collective economy embark on a path of consolidation and development.

In 1963, the broad masses of the Red Star Brigade, inspired by the Da Zhai spirit, together with a few other brigades, raised and strengthened the water reservoir dams and built irrigation canals to expand the irrigated farmland area. At that time, this place was just after suffering a natural disaster, and there were many difficulties. The Party branch led the masses to study Chairman Mao's comments and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" on the construction site again. Chairman Mao said in the comments, "They did not rely on work teams but took the initiative themselves, and the Party members were no longer afraid of difficulties." Everyone thought that in the past, we took the initiative, overcame difficulties, and now, as long as we take the initiative, difficulties can also be overcome. Chairman Mao's instructions inspired everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm. In the bitter cold of winter, everyone got up early and worked late, throwing themselves into the battle. As a result, the water reservoir dams were completed ahead of schedule, and the irrigation canals were also completed ahead of schedule, expanding the irrigated area to over 3,000 mu.

In 1964, the collective economy here developed significantly. However, among the nine production teams, the development was unbalanced. In terms of water conservancy, sunlight, and soil conditions, the Zhuanfang Production Team was relatively good, but this team's production was always lagging behind, and the rice yield per mu was about one-fourth lower than that of the advanced teams. To solve this problem, the brigade Party branch studied Chairman Mao's comments again. The comments said that whether the cooperative society can guarantee increased production depends on the leadership of the Party committee. Therefore, the brigade Party branch decided to strengthen the leadership of the Zhuanfang Production Team. Secretary Pu De Gao went to the Zhuanfang Production Team for a work visit. After investigation and research, it was found that the fundamental reason for the team's backwardness was that the landlord element Zhu Ke Li was plotting to sabotage the collective economy, and some cadres of the production team were blinded by family relationships and showed weakness in the face of serious class struggle, failing to give the class enemies the necessary blows. After finding the root cause of the backwardness, Pu De Gao organized the cadres and commune members to study Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle, mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to fight against the lawless landlord Zhu Ke Li face to face. Through the struggle, everyone's awareness was raised, and their enthusiasm grew stronger, promoting the rapid development of all production and construction undertakings. Now, the Zhuanfang Production Team has become an advanced team in the entire brigade.

The Party members of the Red Star Brigade regard Chairman Mao's comments as a revolutionary family treasure. Not only do they never forget this instruction for a moment, but they also often tell the revolutionary successors about Chairman Mao's teachings. The more than 200 young people in this brigade, under the leadership of the Party branch, organized Mao Zedong Thought study groups. They said they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance faster on the socialist road.

Secretary Pu De Gao of the Red Star Brigade Party branch always acts according to Chairman Mao's teachings. In 1964, he went to a backward team for a work visit, relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out class struggle, raised the class awareness of the commune members, promoted production, and turned the backward team into an advanced team. During the winter water conservancy construction, he was the first to jump into the icy water and thin mud, leading the masses to insist on construction. He also led the masses through the Party branch to carry out scientific experiments, achieving remarkable results.

### 红星大队靠毛泽东思想翻了身

    红星大队靠毛泽东思想翻了身
    毛主席说：“我国的农业的社会主义改造能不能和国家工业化的进度相适应，合作化运动能不能健康地发展，少出毛病，保证增产，就看各级地方党委的领导重心是不是能够迅速地和正确地转移到这一方面来。……贵州的这个乡，自从一九五四年十二月转变工作态度以来，只有五个多月，就取得了很大的成绩。他们不是依赖工作组，而是自己动手了，党员也不怕困难了。”
    现在的永安公社红星生产大队，是原贵州省凤冈县崇新乡的一部分。十年来，这个大队的干部和贫下中农，牢牢记住毛主席的教导，按照毛主席的指示办事，精神面貌发生巨大变化，生产年年上升。社员们谈起“红星”的十年巨变，都异口同声地说，水有源，树有根，毛泽东思想使“红星”翻了身。
    一九六二年，这里遭受了严重的自然灾害，阶级敌人乘机兴风作浪，刮起一股单干风。这时，红星大队党支部组织大家学习毛主席为崇新乡开展互助合作运动写的按语。通过学习，人们的思想亮堂了。有的说：“毛主席的指示是我们的指南针，指南针所指的社会主义方向决不能变！”有的说：“土改没收了地主的土地，并没有没收他们的脑壳，他们总是要破坏的。”这时，正好党的八届十中全会决议传达下来了，党支部就立即把领导重心转移到阶级斗争上来，领导群众打退了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，使集体经济走上了巩固发展的道路。
    一九六三年，红星大队的广大社员，在大寨精神鼓舞下，同几个大队一起，加高加厚水库堤坝，修建引水渠道，以扩大农田灌溉面积。那时，这个地方正是遭受自然灾害之后，困难很多。党支部领导群众在工地上又一次学习了毛主席写的按语和《愚公移山》。毛主席在按语中说：“他们不是依赖工作组，而是自己动手了，党员也不怕困难了”。大家认为，当年我们自己动手，克服了困难，现在，只要自己动手，困难也是能够克服的。毛主席的指示鼓舞了大家的革命干劲，在数九寒天，大家起早贪黑，投入战斗，结果，水库堤坝提前竣工，还提前建成了引水渠道，使灌溉面积扩大到三千多亩。
      一九六四年这里的集体经济有了很大发展。但是，在九个生产队中，发展是不平衡的。论水利、阳光、土质条件，数砖房生产队较好，而这个队的生产一直落后，水稻单产比先进队约低四分之一。为了解决这个问题，大队党支部又一次学习了毛主席写的按语。按语说，合作社能不能保证增产，要看党委的领导。于是，大队党支部决定加强对砖房生产队的领导，支部书记蒲德高到砖房生产队去蹲点。经过调查研究，发现这个队生产落后的根本原因，是地主分子朱克利在搞破坏集体经济的阴谋活动，而生产队的一些干部，被家族关系所蒙蔽，在严重的阶级斗争面前，表现软弱无力，没有及时给予阶级敌人以应有的打击。落后的根子找到了，蒲德高便组织干部、社员学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述，深入发动贫下中农，向不法地主朱克利展开了面对面的斗争。通过斗争，大家的觉悟提高了，干劲越来越大，使各项生产建设事业都得到迅速的发展。现在，砖房生产队已经成为全大队的一个先进队了。
    红星大队的党员，把毛主席的按语当作革命的传家宝。不但自己一时一刻不忘这一指示，还经常向革命后代讲毛主席的教导。这个大队的两百多个青年，在党支部的领导下，组织起毛主席著作的学习小组。他们表示，一定要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得更高，在社会主义大道上更快地前进。

    红星大队党支部书记蒲德高，处处按照毛主席的教导办事。一九六四年，他到后进队蹲点，依靠贫下中农，大搞阶级斗争，提高了社员的阶级觉悟，促进了生产，使后进队变成先进队。冬季兴修水利，他第一个跳到刺骨的冷水、稀泥中，带动群众，坚持施工。他还通过党支部，带领群众大搞科学实验，取得显著成就。这是蒲德高（右）在油菜试验田里教青年社员选留良种。
