To achieve having only "public" in one's heart,

Comrade Cai Yongxiang is only eighteen years old, yet he has accomplished such inspiring deeds. What is the secret? It lies in the thought of Mao Zedong, in the "Three Articles." If we carefully consider Comrade Cai Yongxiang's growth and progress, we can see: whether a person can contribute to the revolution and the people does not depend on age, position, or the length of time one has been in the revolution. It depends on whether one has a completely selfless mindset to serve the people. The "Three Articles" are the principles by which revolutionaries live. Whoever studies and applies the "Three Articles" the best, and applies them the most thoroughly, will have the strongest worldview of serving the people, and will make the greatest contribution to the revolution.

How should one walk the revolutionary path? Comrade Cai Yongxiang has set an example for us: as long as one is alive, one should study the "Three Articles" every day, walk the path of serving the people every day, do things for the people every day, and study and fight until one is old. One should fight until one has only "public" in one's heart, until Mao Zedong's thought truly becomes one's soul, and until one establishes a "public" spirit for the revolution to the end.

    要做到心里只有一个“公”字
    团长　葛振海
    蔡永祥同志只有十八岁，能够作出那样振奋人心的事迹，靠的是什么？靠的是毛泽东思想，靠的是“老三篇”。仔细想想蔡永祥同志成长进步的过程，就可以发现：一个人能不能对革命对人民作出贡献，不在于年龄大小，不在于职务高低，也不在于参加革命时间长短，而在于有没有完全彻底为人民服务的思想。“老三篇”是我们革命者作人的依据。谁活学活用“老三篇”好，用的最彻底，谁为人民服务的世界观就树立的最牢，对革命贡献就最大。
    革命的道路应该怎样走？蔡永祥同志给我们作出了榜样，那就是：活着一天，就要学习一天“老三篇”，走一天为人民服务的道路，做一天为人民服务的事情，活到老，学习到老，战斗到老，一直战斗到心里只有一个“公”字，战斗到把毛泽东思想真正化为自己的灵魂，树立为革命到底的“公”心。
