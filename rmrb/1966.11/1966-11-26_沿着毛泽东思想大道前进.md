An unforgettable ten days have passed. Many friends shed tears of reluctance as they bid farewell to the peasant brothers. The villagers, young and old, accompanied them for mile after mile, giving them countless reminders and instructions: "Come visit us again if you have the time."

The Belgian friend, Beihu, and the French friend, Zuolinmu, planted an apple tree in front of the door of the household that hosted them. They affectionately named it the "Revolutionary Friendship Tree."

Although the foreign friends have left the countryside, the memories of the ten days still linger in their minds. They said, "These precious ten days will be unforgettable for the rest of our lives. In these ten days, we learned more than we did in the past ten years. In these ten days, we learned the excellent qualities of the community members, we learned about class struggle and production struggle. In short, we learned the Mao Zedong Thought that we have long yearned for day and night."

A Latin American friend named Miguel Barba said, "Intellectuals always think they are superior to others, but in reality, only the working masses can achieve great things. I am determined to dedicate myself to the revolution, to unite with the working masses, and to stand with my people to eliminate the common enemy of the world's people, American imperialism, and to contribute everything for the liberation of the working people of my country!"

The French friend, Zuolinmu, said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history.' 'The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous, not understanding this point, we cannot gain even the most basic knowledge.' Unfortunately, I have received a bourgeois education in the past, my theory is empty theory, my practice is blind practice. Only by following Chairman Mao's instructions, wholeheartedly going to the revolutionary masses, learning from the masses, can I see clearly."

The Belgian friend, Monike, shared her thoughts on going to the countryside for labor practice: "A revolutionary cadre must never leave the masses, especially the working masses. The current state of the Soviet Union is a serious lesson. We want revolution, not revisionism. We must often go to the laboring masses, to the practice of class struggle and production struggle, so that we can avoid revisionism."

The Italian youth friend, Yibandeluo Beierduqiluo, said, "Chairman Mao said, looking at whether a young person is revolutionary is to see if they are willing to and actually combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants. This practice has given me a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings. A young person must go to the masses, become one of them, and blend in with them, only then can they truly understand the working people, and better learn Chairman Mao's works, and transform their worldview."

Many foreign friends believe that their ten days of labor in the countryside is just the beginning of their combination with the working masses, the "first step of a long march." They expressed that they will continue to combine more closely with the working masses and learn from them. They excitedly said, "Chairman Mao has paved this revolutionary path for us, and we will forever steadfastly march forward on it."

    沿着毛泽东思想大道前进
    难忘的十天过去了，许多朋友在和农民兄弟告别时，都依依不舍地流下了眼泪。村里的男女老少也是送了一程又一程，千叮咛万嘱咐：有时间再到我们这里来看看。
    比利时朋友贝湖和法国朋友佐林姆，在接待他们住宿的社员家门前，满怀深情地栽了一棵苹果树，他们把它称做“革命友谊树”。
    外国朋友虽然离开了农村，可是十天的生活还在他们脑海中翻腾。他们说，这宝贵的十天，我们终生难忘。这十天学到的东西，比过去十年学的东西还要多。这十天，我们学习了社员们的优秀品质，学习了阶级斗争和生产斗争，一句话，是学习了我们日夜渴求的毛泽东思想。
    一位叫米盖尔·巴尔巴的拉丁美洲朋友说：“知识分子总觉得比别人高明，但实际上只有工农群众才能实现伟大的事业。我决心献身于革命，和工农群众结合，和我国人民站在一起去消灭世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义，为我国劳动人民的解放而贡献出一切！”
    法国朋友佐林姆说：“毛主席教导我们：‘人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。’‘群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。’不幸的是我过去受到的是资产阶级教育，我的理论是空洞的理论，我的实践是盲目的实践。只有照毛主席的指示，全心全意地到革命群众里去，向群众学习，我才能心明眼亮。”
    比利时朋友莫尼克在畅谈她下乡劳动锻炼的感想时说：“一个革命干部，一刻也不能脱离群众，更不能脱离工农群众，苏联的现状就是一个严重的教训。我们要革命，不要修正主义。我们要经常到劳动群众中去，到阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践中去，这样，我们才可能免除修正主义。”
    意大利青年朋友伊万德罗·贝尔杜乔里说：“毛主席说过，看一个青年是不是革命的，就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。这次实践，使我对毛主席的教导有了更深刻的体会。一个青年人，只有到群众中去，成为群众的一员，和群众打成一片，才能真正了解劳动人民，才能更好地学习毛主席著作，改造自己的世界观。”
    许多外国朋友认为，这次他们下乡劳动十天，仅仅是他们和工农群众相结合的开始，是“万里长征的第一步”。他们表示，以后还要更多更好地和工农群众结合，向他们学习。他们激动地说：“毛主席为我们铺设了这条革命的康庄大道，我们将永远坚定不移地走下去。”
