The road of revolution has always been one of unyielding advance, where one person falls and ten thousand stand up. In the past, when we followed Chairman Mao on the Long March, the Kuomintang dispatched hundreds of thousands of troops to block us from the front and rear. But our Red Army soldiers were fearless, enduring hardships without complaint, fearing death not at all. We crossed snow-capped mountains and grasslands, endured wind and rain, and followed Chairman Mao's words to revolutionize. The hearts of Red Army soldiers had only the people, no "I"; only the public, no private. They sacrificed their heads and spilled their blood. When those in front fell, those behind charged forward. Ultimately, we achieved the great victory of the Long March. From Comrade Cai Yongxiang, we once again saw the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, the spirit of the Red Army soldiers of yore, and the future and hope of the world. One Cai Yongxiang may fall, but ten thousand Cai Yongxiangs will emerge. With tens of millions of such fearless, public-spirited communists dedicated to Chairman Mao, we will surely defeat all armed and unarmed enemies.

The life of a revolutionary is a life of struggle, overcoming countless difficulties and obstacles, and advancing unceasingly. To be a thorough revolutionary, one must always be prepared to sacrifice everything for the revolution. The cause of communism is arduous and long. The road of revolution ahead is still very long. We must carry forward the revolutionary tradition, tread in the footsteps of heroes, fear no sacrifice, strive hard, and carry the revolution through to the end.

    革命的路就是前赴后继的路
    红军战士、副师长　袁天禄
    我们学习蔡永祥同志，就要学习他为了革命敢于豁出命的大无畏精神。
    革命的路从来就是前赴后继的路，就是一个人倒下去，亿万人站起来的路。当年，我们跟随毛主席长征，蒋匪帮出动了几十万、上百万的军队前堵后击，可是，我们红军战士“敢”字当头，一不怕苦，二不怕死，爬雪山，过草地，风餐露宿，坚决听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席闹革命。红军战士的心里只有人民，没有“我”；只有“公”，没有私，抛头颅，洒热血，前面的倒下了，后面的又冲上去，终于取得了长征的伟大胜利。从蔡永祥同志身上，我们又一次看到了毛泽东思想的光辉，看到了当年红军战士的气概，看到了全世界的未来和希望。一个蔡永祥牺牲了，千万个蔡永祥将出现。有了千百万个这样无所畏惧，“公”心耿耿向着毛主席的共产主义新人，我们就一定能战胜一切拿枪的敌人和不拿枪的敌人。
    革命者的一生是战斗的一生，是排除万难，克服阻力，不断前进的一生。要作一个彻底的革命者，就要时刻准备为革命豁出自己的一切。共产主义事业任重道远，今后革命的路还很长，我们要发扬革命的传统，踏着英雄的血迹，不怕牺牲，艰苦奋斗，把革命进行到底。
