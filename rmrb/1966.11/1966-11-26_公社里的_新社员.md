These friends from twenty countries have crossed thousands of mountains and rivers to come to Beijing to help build our country. During the height of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they are filled with revolutionary fervor and determined to follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, to combine with the workers and peasants, and voluntarily go to the countryside for labor training. They came to the communes of Lugouqiao, Huangtugang, and Nanyuan in the suburbs of Beijing, and stayed in the homes of the commune members, working alongside them for ten days.

They appeared in the guise of ordinary commune members, starting various farm work as soon as they arrived, without asking for any special treatment. Every day, before dawn, they sang "The East is Red" with the commune members as they went to the fields, and in the evening, they sang "Father and Mother are Dear, but Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" as they finished work. They harvested cabbages, pulled radishes, dug vegetable pits, and built windbreaks—whatever work there was, they did it. Some friends even dug outhouses and worked barefoot in the mud with the commune members.

Many foreign friends were participating in such labor for the first time. However, they took the commune members as their teachers, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, always striving to match the commune members' efforts. On the first day of labor, the brigade cadres and commune members, fearing that they might not be able to endure the physical demands, arranged for an extra rest period. When the foreign experts learned that this was to accommodate them, they refused to take the extra rest. They said, "We 'new commune members' should be the same as the 'old commune members' and absolutely cannot have such special treatment." Some experts even said, "No, we must 'rebel'!" With that, they picked up their baskets and continued working.

One foreign friend participating in carrying soil was already sweating profusely but continued to run back and forth with a full basket. The commune members gestured for him to rest, but he took out his bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read, "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, daring to sacrifice, daring to endure hardships, and daring to engage in continuous battles (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." After finishing, he quickly ran off with his companions carrying the soil baskets. The Colombian friend Li Zhiqiang had his shoulder swollen from carrying the basket, but when others offered to replace him, he refused. He said, "The more tired I am, the more I want to work. The more swollen I am, the more I want to train. I think of the future when I will make revolution with the people of our country, and I have more energy."

The three daughters of the New Zealand friend Ray were going to travel with Chinese students for revolutionary activities. Comrades advised him to return to Beijing the night before to see them off. Ray, fearing that he would miss work, refused to leave early. Only on the morning of the day his daughters were leaving did he and his wife, Ruth Ray, return to the city. After seeing their daughters off, they immediately returned to the brigade, and in the afternoon, they went to work as usual.

The weather was getting colder, and the ground was covered with frost in the morning. In one brigade, someone suggested that the foreign friends should not go to work before breakfast. When the foreign friends heard this, they strongly criticized the idea, saying that taking care of them would lower the standards for them. As a result, the suggestion to take care of them was rejected halfway.

The commune member Yin Hongqi's home housed four foreign female experts. The old lady of the house thought that these foreign sisters, coming from so far away to China and sincerely working in the countryside, were closer than relatives and should be well treated. She tried to prepare good food for the friends at every meal. The American friend Erin repeatedly dissuaded her, saying, "We came to the countryside to train and to reform our thinking. We do not need to eat well. We appreciate your kindness, but we cannot have special treatment." The Chinese comrades, fearing that the foreign friends might catch a cold, prepared more quilts and blankets for them. Many foreign friends also refused to accept them, demanding that the Chinese comrades treat them like Chinese cadres, seeing them as revolutionary comrades who can withstand the wind and rain.

    公社里的“新社员”
    这些来自二十个国家的朋友，是越过千重山，跨过万道水，来北京帮助我国建设的部分外国专家。在我国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，他们满怀革命激情，决心遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，和工农群众相结合，自愿下乡进行劳动锻炼。他们来到北京郊区的芦沟桥、黄土岗、南苑三个人民公社，分头住在社员家里，和社员们一起，参加了十天的劳动。
    他们完全以普通社员的姿态出现，一来就干起了各种农活，从不要任何特殊照顾。每天，天蒙蒙亮，他们和社员一起唱着《东方红》下地，傍晚，他们和社员一起唱着《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》收工。收白菜，拔萝卜，挖菜窖、架风障，什么活儿他们都干。有些朋友还和社员一起掏茅坑，光着脚和泥。
    许多外国朋友参加这样的劳动，还是第一次。但是，他们以社员们为师，不怕苦，不怕累，处处要向社员们看齐。第一天劳动时，生产队的干部和社员们怕他们体力撑不住，就多安排了一次休息时间。当外国专家们知道这是为了照顾他们的时候，怎么也不肯多休息。他们说：“我们‘新社员’应该和‘老社员’一样，绝不能有这样的特殊待遇”。有的专家还连声说：“不行，我们要‘造反’！”说罢，拿起箩筐又去干起活来。
    一位参加抬土的外国朋友，干得已是满头大汗，仍然抬着满筐土来回奔跑。社员们打着手势硬要他休息。他掏出红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》念道：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战
  （即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”念完后，他又和伙伴们抬着土筐飞快地跑了。哥伦比亚朋友李志强抬筐把肩压肿了，别人要换他，他怎么也不肯。他说：“越累越要干，越肿越要锻炼。我想到将来同我国人民一起闹革命，需要培养不怕艰苦的精神，我就有劲了。”
    新西兰朋友雷克的三个女儿要同中国同学到外地进行革命串连，同志们劝他前一天晚上回北京看看。雷克怕耽误劳动，说什么也不肯早走，直到女儿要走的那天清晨，才和他夫人露丝·雷克一起返回城里。他们送走了女儿，马上又赶回了生产队，下午照常出工参加劳动。
    天气渐渐冷起来，早晨大地铺满白霜。在一个生产队里，有人提议让外国朋友以后早饭前不要出工。这一想法被外国朋友知道了，他们提出了严厉的批评，说照顾他们就是降低了对他们的要求。结果，这个想要照顾他们的意见，被半路上顶了回来。
    社员尹洪奇家里住了四位外国女专家。这家的老大娘想，这些外国姐妹，从那么远的外国来到中国，还实心实意地到乡下来劳动，这比亲戚还亲，可得好好招待招待。她每顿饭都想法为朋友们做点好菜。美国朋友艾琳一次又一次地劝阻说：“我们是下乡来锻炼的，是来改造思想的，我们不需要吃好的。大娘的心意我们领了，但是我们不能特殊。”中国同志怕外国朋友受凉，为他们多准备了些褥子和毯子，许多外国朋友也拒绝接受，还要求中国同志把他们当中国干部一样看待，把他们看做是能够经风雨的革命同志。（附图片）
