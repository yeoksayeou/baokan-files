	Comrades Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Chen Yi, and others attended the meeting. Comrades Yao Wenyuan and four others spoke, and Comrade Chen Boda delivered the closing remarks.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 31st, in the unprecedented high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution, over seven hundred thousand cultural revolutionaries from the capital and various parts of the country, including Red Guards, workers, peasants, and representatives of literary and artistic circles, held a grand rally today to solemnly commemorate the great banner of the proletarian cultural front, Lu Xun. The revolutionary masses present were full of spirit and fighting enthusiasm, determined to take Lu Xun as their model, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, inherit and carry forward Lu Xun's fearless, thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit of rebellion, brow knitted, defying U.S. imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism led by the Soviet Communist Party, and reactionaries of all countries, head bowed, a willing ox for the revolutionary people of the whole of China and the world, vow to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to the death, thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line, carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, and make greater contributions to the world proletarian revolutionary cause.

	Leaders and representatives from various sectors, including Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Chen Yi, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Jiang Qing, Liu Zhijian, Zhang Chunqiao, Liu Jianxun, Zhao Yimin, Guo Moruo, Xu Guangping, Chu Tunan, Xie Zhenzhong, Wang Li, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Mu Xin, Yao Wenyuan, Wang Dongxing, Zhou Rongxin, Tang Pingzhu, Hu Chi, Chen Yading, Cao Yiyou, Jin Jingmai, Yuan Mingzhu, Nie Yuanzi, Zhang Ben, Qu Xian, Li Lifang, Qian Haoliang, Zhang Yingzhe, Wei Fengying, Zheng Shuyu, attended the meeting. They and representatives of the capital's Red Guards ascended the stage to thunderous applause.

	Foreign friends invited to attend the meeting and seated on the stage included the famous American writer Anna Louise Strong, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Senanayake, General Secretary of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association Chard, Deputy Head of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's Permanent Representative Office in China Nguyen Minh Phuong, Japanese citizen Kinzaburo Kanazawa, British citizen Hong Ruoshi, Angolan citizen Dakru, Chilean citizen Pablo Cortes, and New Zealand citizen Rewi Alley.

	The meeting venue was adorned with red flags. Opposite the stage stood a giant board with Chairman Mao's quotations: "Lu Xun is the bravest, most resolute, most loyal, and most ardent national hero who, on the cultural front, represents the majority of the nation, charging into the enemy's ranks. The direction of Lu Xun is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation." "Lu Xun's two lines, 'Brow knitted, defying the world's scorn, head bowed, a willing ox for the young,' should be our motto. 'The world' here refers to the enemy. We will never yield to any vicious enemy. 'The young' here refers to the proletariat and the masses. All Communists, all revolutionaries, all revolutionary literary and artistic workers should learn from Lu Xun's example, be the ox for the proletariat and the masses, devote themselves to the cause, and strive until death."

	The memorial meeting for Lu Xun was presided over by Comrade Chen Boda, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group.

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan delivered a lengthy speech titled "Memorializing Lu Xun's Revolution to the End" (full text on page 2). Yao Wenyuan said: Lu Xun's contributions are multifaceted. His essence, his core, is the proletarian revolutionary spirit pointed out by Chairman Mao. Memorializing Lu Xun, first and foremost, is to follow the great Mao Zedong Thought and greatly carry forward this fearless, thorough revolutionary spirit, and fight to the end against U.S. imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism led by the Soviet Communist Party, those who shout and jump in the anti-China chorus, domestic and foreign reactionary forces, and all ghosts and monsters.

	Yao Wenyuan said, in February of this year, Comrade Lin Biao entrusted Comrade Jiang Qing to convene a symposium on military literary and artistic work. In the "Minutes" of this symposium, which has profound historical significance, Mao Zedong Thought answered many major problems of the cultural revolution in the socialist period, defended the proletarian literary and artistic line, thoroughly exposed the bourgeois literary and artistic line represented by Zhou Yang in the 1930s, and exposed and criticized Zhou Yang's conspiracy to distort history and attack Lu Xun. This is a struggle to defend Mao Zedong Thought and the correct line represented by Chairman Mao. Today, in the proletarian cultural revolution, the struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois lines continues, and as the struggle deepens, it takes on certain new forms. We must resolutely defend and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and overthrow the bourgeois reactionary line!

	Yao Wenyuan said: In the battle legacy left by Lu Xun, there are many profound thoughts that summarize the historical experience of class struggle on the cultural front, worthy of our learning and carrying forward. Now I will mention a few points:

	First, we must carry forward Lu Xun's spirit of "beating a fallen dog." Second, we must carry forward Lu Xun's persistent, enduring revolutionary spirit. Third, we must learn Lu Xun's dialectical viewpoint in observing problems. Fourth, the most important and fundamental thing is to learn Lu Xun's great communist spirit of devoting himself to the proletarian revolutionary cause until death.

	Yao Wenyuan concluded: We must, like Lu Xun, constantly transform our thoughts, keep up with the ever-developing situation, forever follow the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao in making revolution, forever be with the revolutionary people, eagerly learn new things, enthusiastically support new things, and forever advance in the fiery class struggle of the socialist revolution, advance to the end, never retreat halfway, never fall behind, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be a good student and good soldier of Chairman Mao!

	Beijing Geological Institute student Huang Ping'an spoke at the meeting with the topic "Learning from Lu Xun, Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao" (full text on page 3). He said: We must learn Lu Xun's spirit of daring to struggle and daring to make revolution, learn Lu Xun's tenacious fighting spirit, firmly stand under the great banner of Chairman Mao, thoroughly and completely criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

	Down with conciliationism, down with compromise, down with servility! We must definitely take over the revolutionary cause, take over Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the revolution through to the end!

	Beijing Changzheng Middle School (formerly the 44th Middle School) student Liu Lu spoke at the meeting with the topic "Refuting Simonov" (full text on page 3). She said, Simonov is a great traitor to the Soviet revolution. Under the pretext of memorializing Lu Xun, he slanders the great communist warrior Lu Xun and attacks our proletarian cultural revolution. We will never allow this traitor to defile Lu Xun's glorious name.

	Liu Lu said: We, the little red soldiers of Chairman Mao, must take Lu Xun as our model and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. We must make the sky Mao Zedong's sky, the earth Mao Zedong's earth, and the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought! We must plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world!

	Comrade Xu Guangping spoke at the meeting with the topic "The Sun of Mao Zedong Thought Shines on Lu Xun" (full text on page 3).

	Xu Guangping said: I deeply feel that, whether in the past or today, the one who cares most about Lu Xun, understands Lu Xun the most, and gives the most correct, most comprehensive, and most profound evaluation of Lu Xun is not someone else, but our most beloved and greatest leader, Chairman Mao.

	Chairman Mao praises Lu Xun as the commander of the cultural revolution, but Lu Xun always regards himself as a small soldier of the Party. Lu Xun has unlimited respect and unlimited love for our most beloved Chairman Mao. In the white terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries, he fearlessly declared that he could be a comrade of Chairman Mao, which was a great honor. At that time, Lu Xun and Chairman Mao, though living in distant places, Lu Xun's heart yearned for Chairman Mao and followed Chairman Mao. Our great leader Chairman Mao is the red sun in Lu Xun's heart.

	Guo Moruo spoke at the meeting with the topic "Memorializing Lu Xun's Spirit of Rebellion" (full text on page 4). Guo Moruo said: This year, September 25th, is the 85th anniversary of Lu Xun's birth. Some countries also hold memorials on this day. Lu Xun is respected by international friends, which we find inspiring. But it must be admitted that some people, under the pretext of memorializing Lu Xun, actually distort Lu Xun and engage in frenzied anti-China activities. The Soviet modern revisionists are an example. We warn these buzzing flies and seemingly stronger bears and tigers: you pests, in the era of "the seas churn and the clouds rage, the winds howl and the thunder roars," the day when you are thoroughly swept away by the people of all countries is not far off!

	As the memorial meeting for Lu Xun was about to conclude, Comrade Chen Boda delivered the closing remarks (full text on page 1). His speech was met with wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

    七万多文化革命大军集会，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬鲁迅的大无畏革命造反精神，横眉冷对美帝苏修和各国反动派，俯首甘为全中国和全世界革命人民的牛，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为世界无产阶级革命事业作出更大贡献。
    周恩来、陶铸、陈伯达、陈毅等同志出席，姚文元等五位同志讲话，陈伯达同志致闭幕词
    据新华社三十一日讯　在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，首都和来自全国各地的红卫兵、工农兵和文艺工作者的代表共七万多文化革命大军，今天下午举行盛大集会，隆重纪念无产阶级文化战线上的伟大旗手鲁迅。到会革命群众意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心以鲁迅为榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继承和发扬鲁迅的大无畏的、彻底的无产阶级革命造反精神，横眉冷对以美国为首的帝国主义，横眉冷对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，横眉冷对各国反动派，俯首甘为全中国和全世界革命人民的牛，誓死捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为世界无产阶级革命事业作出更大贡献。
    各方面的负责人和各界代表周恩来、陶铸、陈伯达、陈毅、谢富治、刘宁一、萧华、杨成武、江青、刘志坚、张春桥、刘建勋、赵毅敏、郭沫若、许广平、楚图南、谢镗忠、王力、关锋、戚本禹、穆欣、姚文元、汪东兴、周荣鑫、唐平铸、胡痴、陈亚丁、曹轶欧、金敬迈、阮铭、聂元梓、张本、瞿希贤、李丽芳、钱浩梁、张映哲、尉凤英、郑淑玉等，出席了大会。他们和首都红卫兵的代表走上主席台的时候，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
    应邀出席大会并在主席台上就座的外国朋友，有美国著名作家斯特朗、亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克、亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多、越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳、日本人士金泽幸雄、英国人士洪若诗、安哥拉人士达克鲁斯、智利人士巴佛罗·柯尔特斯、新西兰人士艾黎。
    大会会场到处红旗招展。主席台对面矗立着巨大的毛主席语录牌，上面写着：“鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。”“鲁迅的两句诗，‘横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛’，应该成为我们的座右铭。‘千夫’在这里就是说敌人，对于无论什么凶恶的敌人我们决不屈服。‘孺子’在这里就是说无产阶级和人民大众。一切共产党员，一切革命家，一切革命的文艺工作者，都应该学鲁迅的榜样，做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”
    纪念鲁迅大会由中共中央政治局常委、中央文化革命小组组长陈伯达同志主持。
    姚文元同志在会上作了题为《纪念鲁迅革命到底》的长篇讲话（全文见第二版）。姚文元说：鲁迅的贡献是多方面的。它的灵魂，它的核心，就是毛主席指出的无产阶级的革命精神。纪念鲁迅，首先和主要的，就是要按照伟大的毛泽东思想，大大发扬这种大无畏的、彻底的革命精神，同以美国为首的帝国主义、同以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义、同那些反华大合唱中乱跳乱叫的啦啦队、同国内外的反动势力、同一切牛鬼蛇神战斗到底。
    姚文元说，今年二月，林彪同志委托江青同志召开部队文艺工作座谈会。在这个有深远历史意义的座谈会的《纪要》中，用毛泽东思想回答了社会主义时期文化革命许多重大问题，捍卫了无产阶级文艺路线，彻底揭露了三十年代以周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺路线，揭露、批判了周扬篡改历史、打击鲁迅的阴谋。这是一场保卫毛泽东思想、保卫以毛主席为代表的正确路线的斗争。今天无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级和资产阶级两条路线的斗争还在继续，并且随着斗争的深入发展而采取了某些新的形式，我们要坚决保卫和贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，打倒资产阶级的反动路线！
    姚文元说：在鲁迅留下的战斗的遗产中，有许多很深刻的思想，概括了文化战线上阶级斗争的历史经验，值得我们学习和发扬。现在只举出几点：
    第一，我们要发扬鲁迅“打落水狗”的战斗精神。第二，我们要发扬鲁迅坚韧、持久的革命精神。第三，要学习鲁迅观察问题时的辩证的观点。第四，最重要、最根本的，是要学习鲁迅为无产阶级革命事业鞠躬尽瘁、死而后已的伟大的共产主义精神。
    姚文元最后说：我们一定要像鲁迅那样不断改造自己的思想，跟上不断发展的形势，永远跟着伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席闹革命，永远同革命的人民在一起，努力学习新事物，热情支持新事物，在社会主义革命的阶级斗争的烈火中，永远前进，革命到底，永不中途退却！永不掉队！永远忠于毛主席，永远做毛主席的好学生和好战士！
    北京地质学院学生黄平稳以《学习鲁迅，永远忠于毛主席》为题在会上发言（全文见第三版）。他说：我们要学习鲁迅敢于斗争、敢于革命的精神，要学习鲁迅的“韧”的战斗精神，坚定地站在毛主席的伟大旗帜下，全面地彻底地批判资产阶级的反动路线，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    打倒调和主义，打倒折衷主义，打倒奴隶主义。我们一定接革命的班，接毛泽东思想的班，将革命进行到底！
    北京长征中学（原四十四中）学生刘路在会上作了题为《斥西蒙诺夫》的发言（全文见第三版）。她说，西蒙诺夫是苏联革命的大叛徒。他借口纪念鲁迅，诬蔑伟大的共产主义战士鲁迅，攻击我国的无产阶级文化大革命。我们绝不允许这个大叛徒玷污鲁迅的光辉名字。
    刘路说：我们毛主席的红小兵要以鲁迅为榜样，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们要让天是毛泽东的天，地是毛泽东的地，人是毛泽东思想武装起来的人！要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全世界！
    许广平同志在会上以《毛泽东思想的阳光照耀着鲁迅》为题发表了讲话（全文见第三版）。
    许广平说：我深深感到，无论在过去和今天，最关心鲁迅，最了解鲁迅，对鲁迅作出最正确、最全面、最深刻的评价的，不是别人，正是我们最最敬爱最最伟大的领袖毛主席。
    毛主席称赞鲁迅是文化革命的主将，但鲁迅总是以党的一名小兵自命。鲁迅对我们最最敬爱的毛主席是无限地崇敬和无限地热爱。他在国民党反动派的白色恐怖中，不顾个人生命安危，公开宣告自己能作为毛主席的一个同志，是很大的光荣。当时鲁迅和毛主席虽然住在天南地北，但鲁迅的心，向往着毛主席，跟随着毛主席，我们伟大的领袖毛主席，是鲁迅心中最红最红的红太阳。
    郭沫若在会上作了题为《纪念鲁迅的造反精神》的讲话（全文见第四版）。郭沫若说：今年九月二十五日是鲁迅诞生八十五周岁。有的国家也有人在这个日子里举行纪念的。鲁迅受到国际友人的尊重，我们是感到鼓舞的。但不容讳言，有的人却是假借纪念鲁迅之名，而进行歪曲鲁迅、猖狂反华之实。苏联现代修正主义者便是一个例子。我们要警告这些嗡嗡叫的苍蝇和比它们貌似强大的熊罴虎豹：你们这些害人虫，在“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”的时代，被各国人民彻底扫荡干净的日子，已经不远了！
    在纪念鲁迅的大会将要结束时，陈伯达同志致闭幕词（全文见第一版）。他的讲话在全场激起一阵又一阵热烈的掌声。
