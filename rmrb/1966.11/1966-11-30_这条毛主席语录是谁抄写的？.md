This quote from Chairman Mao was copied by whom?

Stenyan Li Ming Machinery Manufacturing Company	Wáng Yùxīn

Young machinist Zhang Wu did not sleep all night.

In the midst of the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all members of the lathe group responded enthusiastically to the call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They participated in the criticism of the bourgeoisie while also rolling up their sleeves to trial-manufacture a new product. However, after several attempts, it still failed. Yesterday, they tried again, but there were still problems. Zhang Wu returned from the workshop to the dormitory and immediately read "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When he read, "People want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the expected results, they must make their thoughts conform to the laws of objective reality. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice..." his face lit up with joy. He raised his "Quotations from Chairman Mao" high and said, "Chairman Mao, I have heard your words, and I am full of energy. I will definitely be able to produce the new product!"

Looking out the window, it was already dawn. He lay down on the bed, wanting to rest for a while. But as soon as his head touched the pillow, he asked himself, "Have all the members of the group learned this quote?" He thought, "Write it on the quote board, and everyone can learn it as soon as they start work." He got out of bed and rushed to the factory.

The workshop was still empty. Zhang Wu hurried to the quote board to copy this quote, but he was surprised to see that someone had already written it. "People want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the expected results..." He read it aloud and scolded himself for coming late. But then he thought, "This shows that everyone has learned this quote and thought of Chairman Mao's teachings. This is very good!" He decided to go and check on the new product. After walking past several rows of machines, he heard someone talking. He walked a bit further and saw two senior workers squatting in front of the box containing the new product. One was Party cell leader Old Wang, and the other was production team leader Old Li. He heard Old Li say, "The problem has been found. This is because we listened to Chairman Mao's words, overcame all difficulties, and strove for victory; we grasped the objective laws..." Zhang Wu was very happy and thought, "Old Wang and Old Li probably didn't sleep last night either and found the problem with the new product. The quote must have been written by them."

Just as he was thinking, he heard Old Li say, "Let's have a meeting first when we start work and announce the good news. This batch of new products can be made quickly."

Old Wang thought for a long time before answering, "I think we shouldn't announce it yet." He turned and asked Old Li, "Do you think everyone has learned the quote on the quote board?"

Zhang Wu was anxious and thought, "Why is Old Wang bringing up this issue? Why not announce the good news to everyone?"

At this time, Old Li answered Old Wang's question, "In my opinion, everyone has learned it. I know these young people, they treat Chairman Mao's words as their lifeblood. Whatever Chairman Mao says, they do it. You think, at this critical moment, how can they not seriously read Chairman Mao's book?"

Zhang Wu thought, "Old Li understands us, he's right!"

At this time, Old Wang smiled and asked, "Have they all understood it and truly applied it after learning it?"

"That's not necessarily true," Old Li replied thoughtfully. Zhang Wu thought, "Right, I learned this quote, but can I make our thoughts conform to the objective situation of the new product? This is indeed a problem."

Zhang Wu was still thinking when suddenly Old Li, as if discovering something, said loudly, "Old Wang, you've asked a key question. Just announcing to everyone that the new product has been made is not enough. If we guide everyone to understand the problem according to Chairman Mao's teachings and find the problem with the new product, that would be significant." Old Li seemed very excited. Old Wang also smiled and said, "You think the same as I do. We not only teach the young people how to solve one or two technical problems but also teach them how to grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought."

"Yes, we must do everything possible to guide everyone to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively. This is a matter of great importance for the revolution for thousands of years! So, let's do this: as soon as we start work, first organize everyone to study and discuss Chairman Mao's quotes. I believe that through study and discussion, they will definitely be able to make the new product themselves." Old Li said, standing up. Zhang Wu heard these words and felt that he still needed to work harder on the "application" of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. He walked up to them and greeted them. The two senior workers knew he had come to copy the quote and were both happy, smiling.

    这条毛主席语录是谁抄写的？
    沈阳黎明机械制造公司　王玉鑫
    青年车工张武，一夜没睡。
    在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，车工组的全体同志们，积极响应“抓革命，促生产”的战斗号召，参加对资产阶级的批判，同时鼓足干劲，参加试制一种新产品。但试了几次都失败了，昨天又试验了一次，还是有毛病。张武从车间回到宿舍，就读《毛主席语录》，当他读到“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。……”他的脸上现出喜悦的光彩，他把《毛主席语录》本往高一举说：“毛主席啊，我听了您的话，浑身都是劲，我一定能够把新产品搞出来！”
    望望窗外，天已经蒙蒙亮了，他往床上一躺，想歇一会儿。可是，头一挨枕头，他问自己：“小组的同志们都学了这条语录了吗？对，写在语录板上，一上班，大家就能学起来。”他翻身下床，就往工厂飞奔。
    车间，还没人。张武匆忙地奔向语录板前想去抄写这条语录，但是望了一眼就吃了一惊，不知谁已经抄写出来了。“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，……”他一边念着，一边暗暗责备自己来得晚了，可是又一想：“这说明大家都学了这一条，想到毛主席这条教导了，这样很好！”他决定去看看新产品。绕过几排机床，忽听有人说话，他又往前走走，看见有两个老工人蹲在装新产品的箱子前谈话。一个是党小组长老王，一个是生产组长老李。只听老李说：“毛病找到了，这是因为听了毛主席的话，排除万难，去争取胜利；抓住了客观规律……”张武听了非常高兴，他想：“老王和老李可能一宿也没睡，把新产品的毛病找出来了。语录也一定是他们抄写的。”正想着，又听老李说：“上班先开个会，把好消息公布公布，这批新产品很快就能干出来。”
    老王寻思了半天才回答：“我看先不公布。”他反过来问老李说：“你认为语录板上写的那段语录大家都学过了吗？”
    张武心急地想：“老王把问题扯到哪去了，为什么不向大家公布这个好消息呢？”
    这时，老李回答老王的问题说：“照我看，大家都学了，这帮小青年我了解，他们把毛主席的话当作命根子，毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。你想，在这个节骨眼上，他们怎能不认真地读毛主席的书？”
    张武想：“老李了解我们，说得对！”
    这时，老王又笑着问：“学了以后，都能领会，都能真正用上吗？”
      “那可就不一定了。”老李一边寻思一边回答。张武想：“对呀，我学了这段语录，能不能使我们的想法符合新产品的客观情况，这可确实是个问题。”
    张武正在想着。突然老李像发现了什么似的，大声说：“老王，你这个问题算问到点子上了。光向大家公布新产品搞出来，这还不算完全抓得够劲儿。要是引导大家按照毛主席的教导去认识问题，把新产品的毛病找出来，这意义就大啦。”老李显得非常兴奋。老王也笑着说：“你想的和我想的一样，我们不光教会青年人怎样解决一两个技术关键，而且要教会他们怎样掌握和运用毛泽东思想。”
    “对呀，千方百计引导大家活学活用毛泽东思想，这是关系到千百年革命的大事！那就这样，一上班，就先组织大家学习、讨论毛主席语录，我相信，通过学习和讨论，他们自己也一定能把新产品搞出来。”老李说着站起来。张武听了这些话，觉得自己活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫还不够劲，一定要好好地向老工人学习。他走上前去和他们两人打招呼，两个老工人知道他是赶来抄写语录的，都高兴地笑了。
