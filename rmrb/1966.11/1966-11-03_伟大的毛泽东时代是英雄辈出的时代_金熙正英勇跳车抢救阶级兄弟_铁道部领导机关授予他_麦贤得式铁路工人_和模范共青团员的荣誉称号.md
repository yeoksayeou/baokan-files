The great era of Mao Zedong is an era of heroes. Jin Xizheng, a railway worker from Jilin Province, demonstrated extraordinary bravery in a critical and severe accident. He risked his life to save his class brothers and protect state property, showing the iron will and revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. The Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the Communist Party of China's Ministry of Railways awarded Jin Xizheng the honorary title of "Makhan De-style Railway Worker" and presented him with a medal. The National Railway Committee of the Communist Youth League of China awarded him the honorary title of Model League Member and presented him with a certificate. The Ministry of Railways also called on all railway workers, students, and family members across the country to learn from Jin Xizheng.

Jin Xizheng's heroic deeds once again vividly demonstrate that all heroic actions stem from the great thought of Mao Zedong. Only by seriously, diligently studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the thoughts of Mao Zedong, and working hard to transform one's worldview, can one forge oneself into a strong revolutionary fighter of the proletariat.

The incident occurred in the early summer of this year. A section of the railway from Mudanjiang to Tumen was undergoing intense maintenance and construction. One day, Jin Xizheng, along with his foreman, was driving a railway motorcycle to transport sleepers to the work site. Six track maintenance workers and three children were also on the vehicle. As the car approached a downhill slope where it should have slowed down, due to a malfunctioning brake, the speed did not decrease but instead accelerated like a wild horse down the slope. The car sped past the planned stopping point, heading straight for a mountain tunnel, and was about to enter the "dead track" of the next station. A major accident that would endanger the lives of eleven people and damage state property was about to occur.

At this critical moment, Jin Xizheng had an idea: jump off the car immediately, go to the mountain tunnel guard post, and call the next station to open the main line, avoiding the "dead track." This would prevent the accident from happening. However, this area is a mountainous railway, with trees, deep gullies, cliffs, and construction materials like rails, sleepers, and tools on both sides. Jumping off the car was dangerous. The car continued to rush towards the mountain tunnel. At this urgent moment, Jin Xizheng's blood boiled. The teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao echoed in his ears: "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai." Chairman Mao's teachings gave him boundless strength. To rescue his class brothers on the car and to prevent state property from being damaged, he put his personal safety aside. At this moment, an older worker on the car also wanted to jump off, but Jin Xizheng pulled him back. Jin Xizheng said, "You are older, it's dangerous!" As soon as the words left his mouth, he dashed to the car door and jumped off the speeding vehicle.

Jin Xizheng was injured in multiple places and suffered severe concussion. He felt dizzy and in intense pain all over. However, he firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and his responsibility to "save people" and "save the car." He endured the pain and stood up, crossed the railway, jumped over the high barrier, and rushed straight to the mountain tunnel guard post. When he heard the soldiers at the mountain tunnel guard post make the call, he fainted.

Due to Jin Xizheng's brave jump off the car and timely phone call, the next station opened the line; combined with the efforts of the people on the car, the motorcycle stopped safely, thus avoiding this major accident.

Jin Xizheng is a railway motorcycle worker from the Tumen Engineering Section of the Jilin Railway Bureau, a League member, 24 years old, and comes from a poor farming family of the Korean ethnicity. He loves the Party, socialism, and the great leader Chairman Mao deeply. With profound class feelings, he studies and applies Chairman Mao's works. Over the years, he has not only repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Moving the Mountains" and other brilliant works but also read more than 30 articles from "Selected Works of Mao Zedong (Type B)." He studies Chairman Mao's books, especially the "Three Constantly Read Articles," as his motto, learning a bit, using a bit, repeatedly learning, and repeatedly using, seriously transforming his worldview. He wrote in his notes: Chairman Mao said, "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it is thoroughly for the people's interests." Comrade Zhang Side died for the people's interests, so his death is heavier than Mount Tai. He is a true hero and my role model. I want to be like him, do more things beneficial to the people when alive, and be a person beneficial to the people. If the Party and the people need me to sacrifice my life, I will step forward without fear of sacrifice. He also said, "Comrade Zhang Side, Comrade Norman Bethune, and many other revolutionary fighters sacrificed themselves for the revolutionary cause of China. We young people should inherit their cause and achieve living for the people and dying for the people." Jin Xizheng is not only saying this but also doing it.

After being injured, Jin Xizheng was sent to the hospital. Under the care of the Party, and with the timely rescue and proper treatment by the medical staff, his external injuries have now fully healed, and his concussion is gradually improving.

    伟大的毛泽东时代是英雄辈出的时代
    金熙正英勇跳车抢救阶级兄弟
    铁道部领导机关授予他“麦贤得式铁路工人”和模范共青团员的荣誉称号
    据新华社长春二日电　伟大的毛泽东时代，是英雄辈出的时代。吉林省铁路工人金熙正在一次紧急的严重事故中，为了保卫阶级兄弟的生命安全和国家财产，临危不惧，舍身跳车，带伤坚持战斗，表现了无产阶级的钢铁意志和革命硬骨头精神。铁道部和中共铁道部政治部授予金熙正以“麦贤得式铁路工人”的荣誉称号，并发给他奖章；共青团全国铁道委员会授予他模范共青团员荣誉称号，并发给他奖状。铁道部还号召全国铁路职工、学生和家属向金熙正学习。
    金熙正的英雄事迹，再一次生动地表明：一切英雄行为，无一不来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。只有认真地、刻苦地学习“老三篇”，学习毛泽东思想，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，才能把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士。
    事情发生在今年初夏。从牡丹江到图们的一段铁路正在紧张地进行养护施工。一天，金熙正随师傅驾驶铁路摩托车向作业地点运送枕木。随车前往的还有六名养路工人和三名搭乘儿童。车行至一个应该减速的下坡道上，由于车闸失灵，车速不但没有减慢，反而像脱缰的野马一样，飞快地沿着坡道向下冲去。车越跑越快，已经越过了预计的停车地点，眼看就要穿过一座山洞，闯入下一个车站的“死道”，一场危及十一个人生命和损坏国家财产的翻车事故，就要发生了。
    就在这千钧一发的时刻，金熙正脑子里闪过一个念头：马上跳下车去，从山洞哨所给下一个车站打电话，联系开通正线，不进“死道”，这样，就可以避免事故的发生。但是，这一带是盘山铁路，沿线有树木、深沟、峭壁，两侧还有施工用的钢轨、枕木、工具……，跳车有生命危险。车继续冲向山洞。在这紧急关头，金熙正周身热血沸腾。伟大领袖毛主席的教导在他耳边回响：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。毛主席的教导给了他无穷的力量。为了抢救车上的阶级兄弟，为了使国家财产不受损失，他把个人安危置之度外。这时车上的一个老工人也想跳车，但是被金熙正一把拉住。金熙正说：“你年纪大，危险！”话音刚落，他一个箭步窜到车门，从疾驰的车上跳了出去。
    金熙正多处被摔伤，造成了严重的脑震荡。他觉得天旋地转，周身剧痛。但是，他牢牢记着毛主席的教导，记着“救人”、“救车”的责任。他忍着剧痛挺起身来，越过铁路，跨过高栏，直奔山洞哨所。当他听到山洞哨所的战士打通了电话，就昏迷过去了。
    由于金熙正勇敢地跳车，及时打通了电话，下边车站开通了线路；加上车上的人积极采取措施，使摩托车安全停下，终于避免了这场重大事故。
    金熙正是吉林铁路局图们工务段摩托车工人，共青团员，今年二十四岁，出身于朝鲜族一个贫农家庭。他无限热爱党，热爱社会主义，热爱伟大的领袖毛主席。他怀着深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作。几年来，他不仅反复地学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等光辉著作，还通读了《毛泽东著作选读》（乙种本）的三十多篇文章。他读毛主席的书，特别把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，学一点、用一点，反复学、反复用，认真改造世界观。他在笔记中写道：毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”张思德同志是为人民的利益而死的，所以，他的死比泰山还重，他是真正的英雄，是我学习的榜样，我要像他那样，活着多做有利于人民的事情，做一个有益于人民的人。党和人民需要我献出生命，我就挺身而出，不怕牺牲。他还说：“张思德、白求恩等许许多多革命战士为了中国的革命事业牺牲了，我们年轻人就应该继承他们的事业，做到生为人民生，死为人民死。”金熙正是这样说的，也是这样做的。
    金熙正受伤后，被送进医院。在党的关怀下，经过医务人员抢救和妥善治疗，现在外伤已全愈，脑震荡也在逐渐好转。
