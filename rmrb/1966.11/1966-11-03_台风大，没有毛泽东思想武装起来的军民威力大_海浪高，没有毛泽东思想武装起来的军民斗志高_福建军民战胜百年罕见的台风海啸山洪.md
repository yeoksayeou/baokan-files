The editor's note: Mao Zedong Thought is the source of all our victories. The brilliant deeds of the military and civilian population of Fujian in overcoming a once-in-a-century typhoon, tsunami, and flood once again prove this unshakable truth.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Chairman Mao's words are the highest in level, the highest in prestige, and the greatest in power. Every sentence is a truth, and one sentence is worth ten thousand." It is Chairman Mao's "Firmly make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" these seventeen golden words that have given the million military and civilian population of the Fujian coast boundless encouragement and ignited their high fighting spirit. In the face of extremely serious natural disasters, they fear neither heaven nor earth, are not blown down by a level-12 typhoon, and can withstand towering waves. After more than twenty days of heroic struggle, they finally made the typhoon retreat, the tsunami bow its head, and the flood surrender, and production was restored.

The process of Fujian's victory over the "three disasters" was a grand review of the power of the broad military and civilian population armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The facts fully prove that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and truly grasp it, then all class enemies and all natural disasters will be "paper tigers" and will be of no consequence.

The typhoon is strong, but the military and civilian population armed with Mao Zedong Thought are even stronger.
The waves are high, but the military and civilian population armed with Mao Zedong Thought have even higher morale.
The military and civilian population of Fujian have defeated a once-in-a-century typhoon, tsunami, and flood.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 2nd: The million military and civilian population of the eastern coastal region of Fujian, united under Mao Zedong Thought, have overcome a once-in-a-century typhoon, tsunami, and flood during the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, creating the miracle of "great disaster, small loss." They have added another magnificent song of Mao Zedong Thought to our era.

In August and September of this year, the eastern coastal region of Fujian suffered three major natural disasters in just over twenty days. A level-12 typhoon, a tsunami one or two zhang high, torrential rain like iron pellets, and rolling floods attacked simultaneously, fiercely and unusually. Trees as thick as several people could hug were uprooted, fishing boats weighing several tons were blown from the harbor onto land, and stone dams ten meters wide were cut in half. However, the typhoon was strong, but the power of the million military and civilian population united under Mao Zedong Thought was even stronger; the waves were high, but the morale of the million military and civilian population united under Mao Zedong Thought was even higher. With the fearless spirit of "if the sky falls, we will prop it up; if Mount Tai collapses, we will lift it up," they fought against the typhoon, hacked through the giant waves, and battled the floods, ultimately defeating the "three disasters." According to many elderly people in the area, in 1915, a typhoon struck, and after the disaster, corpses lay everywhere. In Luoyuan County alone, more than 300 people died in one place called Jianjiang, and out of 90 fishing households, only 9 remained. This time, the disaster was much more severe, but all 170 households and more than 800 people in Jianjiang were safely evacuated.

I

Mao Zedong Thought was the most powerful ideological weapon guiding the million military and civilian population in fighting against this major natural disaster. After the alert was issued that a level-12 typhoon would make landfall in the eastern coastal region of Fujian, the party, government, and military leadership at all levels in the region held emergency meetings overnight, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "not fight unprepared battles, not fight battles without assurance." They started with themselves, checked their preparedness, arranged work, and issued tasks. The commune members, fishermen, and soldiers all hurried to study the "Three Old Articles" and Chairman Mao's quotations on promoting revolutionary heroism. The million military and civilian population united under Mao Zedong Thought immediately took action before the disaster struck, quickly and orderly preparing for various tasks.

All material preparations were being made rapidly, but people knew that natural disasters are unpredictable, and more spiritual preparation was needed. So, they studied the "Three Old Articles" over and over, carried the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, and with the spirit of "reporting a level-12 typhoon, preparing for a level-24 typhoon," they stood guard at their battle stations, ready to launch a full-scale attack as soon as the typhoon made landfall.

II

The level-12 typhoon made landfall, bringing with it heavy rain and giant waves, sweeping everything in its path.

The local party, government, and military leadership at all levels issued Chairman Mao's great call through telegrams, telephones, and broadcasts: "Firmly make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

These seventeen shining words were the most powerful mobilization order. They crossed mountains and rivers, pierced through the storm and rain, reaching the coast, the villages, the docks, the barracks, the ships, and the heart of every person.

The million military and civilian population used these seventeen shining words to pull fishing boats back from the rolling waves; to move grain in the night of flying bricks; to protect fields and reservoirs from under the floods.

The million military and civilian population used these seventeen shining words to create earth-shattering achievements...

The village of Liping was trapped by the flood, and more than a thousand people were in danger. Sergeant Yang Changheng, Squad Leader Tu Zhonghong, and Wu Guozhen of a certain unit went to scout and rescue. They had just walked a short distance when they were blocked by a three-hundred-meter-wide current. This was the confluence of two rivers into the sea. Going around would take more than a thousand meters from upstream? Impossible, every second now was crucial to the safety of people's lives and property. "For the people, fear no sacrifice, charge ahead!" They dove into the water one by one. Three waves in a row almost swept Tu Zhonghong into the sea. At that moment, Tu Zhonghong's mind flashed with these seventeen shining words, and suddenly his strength doubled, his body full of energy, and he swam towards Liping Village with all his might.

A fishing boat was about to be swallowed by the raging waves. The "Sea Tiger Boat" of a certain naval unit tried to approach it several times to tie a rope, but failed. What to do? They looked at the quotation board with the shining seventeen words and tried again! In the blink of an eye, as the boat approached the fishing boat, Deputy Political Instructor Dai Xueming leaped onto the fishing boat, successfully rescuing it.

The million military and civilian population had these seventeen shining words engraved in their minds, and wherever the wind and waves were the fiercest, they charged ahead. A thousand-meter-high peak called Guanling had its power lines cut off, and it was urgent to restore them. The narrow path to the peak was steep and slippery, and one false step would send a person tumbling down the mountain. Three members of the Red Guards from Chixi Brigade, Yang Xiangxiu, Fu Jianggui, and Chen Xutian, took on this task. They climbed the cliffs and steep walls, unyielding, and pressed forward. When they were blown down and slid backwards, they took a deep breath and leaped up again, continuing to climb. After more than forty rounds of struggle, they finally reached the top of Guanling Peak and restored the telephone line. They said: "With Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, even a level-12 typhoon is just a paper tiger." "Following Chairman Mao's words, even if it's a mountain of knives, we dare to climb!"

III

"...Caring for the party and the masses is more important than caring for oneself, and caring for others is more important than caring for oneself." Chairman Mao's teaching became the common principle of action for the million military and civilian population in fighting against the "three disasters," shining brilliantly.

When the property of the state, the collective, and the individual were all destroyed at the same time, the million military and civilian population instinctively and consciously first rescued the property of the state and the collective. Some rushed to save state grain when their own houses collapsed, and rushed to the coast to protect the dikes...

The director of the power plant of a certain naval unit, Zhou Chongxiu, led soldiers to repair power lines in the storm. Passing by his home, he saw his roof blown off by the typhoon. The soldiers were worried for him, but Zhou Chongxiu pointed to the hillside and said, "Repair the high-voltage power line, quickly!" Without looking back, he led the soldiers up the hillside. That day, Zhou Chongxiu passed by his home eight times, each time seeing his house more damaged, but he never stepped into his home, always saying, "The most important thing now is to rescue people's lives and property."

A tsunami with waves one or two zhang high surged towards a certain machine gun company of the army. The soldiers could have climbed up the mountain behind them. But they shouted, "Even if we die, the people must live," and rushed towards a production team. Soldier Li Jiyou saved five commune members in a row, catching his breath, and then saw a teenager holding a child floating on the water, sinking and rising, in great danger. At that moment, Li Jiyou made a lightning-fast decision: to die for the people is a worthy death, to be a mountain, not a feather. Suddenly full of energy, he swam towards the teenager. The entire company fought for three hours, rescuing more than 120 drowning commune members.

On the dark, windy, and wavy Huangqi Peninsula, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the half-mountain brigade, Lin Zhenxing, rescued three comrades one after another and was already exhausted. At that moment, the team leader was swept away by the waves, so he struggled towards the team leader. The waves pushed him back several times, but he struggled forward several times, determined to get close to the team leader. When he got close to the team leader, he had no strength left, but he disregarded his own safety and resolutely handed the only bamboo pole he had to the team leader, and was swallowed by the waves, sacrificing his life to rescue his class brother.

Thus, the million military and civilian population united under Mao Zedong Thought, fought bravely and tenaciously, and won the great victory of fighting against the typhoon, tsunami, and flood.

IV

The "three disasters" were subdued. However, the anti-disaster struggle did not stop. The million military and civilian population launched an unprecedented large-scale production campaign to strive for a bumper harvest.

The eastern coastal and mountainous areas of Fujian, stretching hundreds of kilometers, from cities to villages, were filled with the songs of labor and a bustling scene. The million military and civilian population had one resolve: "Turn the year of great disaster into the year of bumper harvest." The wind had not stopped, but the fishermen had already set sail to chase after the fish; the water had just receded from the fields, but the commune members had already watered the submerged seedlings with fresh water; as soon as the sky cleared, people started cultivating new tea gardens on the hillsides. The damaged sea dikes were quickly repaired, and the crops were fertilized once to three times.

In the struggle to restore production and rebuild homes, the million military and civilian population united under Mao Zedong Thought, through the tempering of fighting against the "three disasters," greatly promoted communist ideology, and created a moving scene of "one household in difficulty, four neighbors come to help, one place affected, eight directions support."

Twenty-nine students from Minhou Middle School in Minhou County carried grain, cooking utensils, and production tools, marched more than a hundred miles, and rushed to the disaster-stricken Nituan Brigade in Luoyuan County, immediately joining the anti-disaster production.

After the disaster, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who fought side by side with the people carried the quotation boards of Chairman Mao, tools, and dry rations, and once again came to the disaster area to help the people drain the sea water, repair the sea dikes, and build houses. They came without reporting and left without leaving their names. The commune members said, "They are truly good soldiers of Chairman Mao."

V

The typhoon retreated, the tsunami bowed its head, the flood surrendered, and production was restored. When the million military and civilian population conducted a battle summary, they all said that the great victory came from the great Mao Zedong Thought. They loved, believed in, and worshipped Chairman Mao without limit. When they received the alert that the typhoon was about to make landfall, the first thing they did was to wrap Chairman Mao's portrait in a raincoat, put Chairman Mao's works in their chest, and place the quotation board in the safest place. Lan Xingping, a She ethnic female commune member from Xilan Commune, ran out of a house that was about to collapse, holding only a portrait of Chairman Mao, and nothing else. She said, "Before liberation, our She people suffered the most. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the pit of suffering and gave us a happy life. Chairman Mao is our savior, and Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Today, losing some things is nothing, having Mao Zedong Thought is having everything." After repairing the house, she entered her home with joy and hung up the portrait of Chairman Mao.

"Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, having Mao Zedong Thought is having everything." This expresses the heartfelt words of the million military and civilian population. This is the only source of their victory in the anti-disaster struggle.

### 台风大，没有毛泽东思想武装起来的军民威力大  海浪高，没有毛泽东思想武装起来的军民斗志高  福建军民战胜百年罕见的台风海啸山洪

专栏：

    编者按：毛泽东思想是我们取得一切胜利的源泉。这次福建沿海军民战胜百年罕见的台风、海啸和山洪的光辉事迹，再一次证明了这一颠扑不破的真理。
    林彪同志说：“毛主席的话，水平最高，威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。”正是毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这十七个金光闪闪的大字，给了福建沿海百万军民无限的鼓舞力量，激发了他们高昂的战斗意志。在极端严重的自然灾害面前，他们天不怕，地不怕，十二级台风吹不倒，滔天巨浪能顶住。经过二十多天的英勇奋战，终于使台风滚蛋了，海啸低头了，山洪制服了，生产恢复了。
    福建这次战胜“三害”的过程，是对于以毛泽东思想武装起来的广大军民力量的一次大检阅。事实充分说明了：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是无敌的。只要我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来，那么，一切阶级敌人，一切自然灾害，统统都是“纸老虎”，统统都不在话下。
    台风大，没有毛泽东思想武装起来的军民威力大
    海浪高，没有毛泽东思想武装起来的军民斗志高
    福建军民战胜百年罕见的台风海啸山洪
    据新华社福州二日电　用毛泽东思想统一起来的福建东部沿海地区百万军民，在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，战胜百年罕见的台风、海啸、山洪三大自然灾害，创造了“灾害特大，损失特小”的奇迹，为我们时代谱出又一曲响彻云霄的伟大的毛泽东思想的凯歌。
    今年八九月间，福建东部沿海地区，在二十多天内，连续遭到三次特大自然灾害的侵袭。十二级的强台风，一、二丈高的海啸，铁珠般的暴雨，翻滚的山洪，相互交袭，凶猛异常。数人合抱的大树连根拔起，几十吨的渔船从港口吹上陆地，十多米宽的石坝被切成两段。但是，风大，没有用毛泽东思想统一起来的百万军民的威力大；浪高，没有用毛泽东思想统一起来的百万军民的斗志高。他们以“天塌下来我们顶回去，泰山有环我们拎得起”的大无畏精神，抗狂风、劈巨浪、战山洪，胜利制服了“三害”。据当地许多老年人回忆，一九一五年刮了一次台风，灾后死尸遍野，单是罗源县鉴江一处就死了三百多人，九十户渔民，只剩下九户；这次灾害比那次严重得多，鉴江一百七十户渔民，八百多口人，全部安全脱险。
    一
    毛泽东思想是指导百万军民抗击这次特大自然灾害最强大的思想武器。当十二级台风，将从福建东部沿海正面登陆的警报传出以后，闽东沿海地区党政军各级领导机关，连夜召开紧急会议，纷纷按照毛主席“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”的指示，从自己开始，检查备战观念，布置工作，下达任务；公社社员们，渔民们，解放军的指战员们也都抓紧时间学习了“老三篇”和毛主席有关发扬革命英雄主义的语录。用毛泽东思想统一起来的百万军民，在大灾来临之前，立即行动起来，紧张而有秩序地做好各项准备工作。
    一切物资准备在飞快地进行着，但是人们知道自然灾害是个变化无常的怪物，更需要有应付一切的精神准备。于是，他们一遍又一遍地学习“老三篇”，把《毛主席语录》带在身边，以“预报十二级台风，要做好抗击二十四级台风的准备”的精神，严守在各自的战斗岗位上，只待台风登陆，全线出击。
    二
    十二级台风正面登陆了，它夹着暴雨，推着巨浪，排山倒海而来。
    当地党政军各级领导机关，通过电报、电话和广播不断发出毛主席的伟大号召：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    这十七个闪闪发光的大字，是最有力的动员令。它越过高山峻岭，穿过狂风暴雨，传到海边，传到山村，传到码头，传到营房，传到舰艇，传到每一个人心窝。
    百万军民，用这十七个闪闪发光的大字，从滚滚的浪涛里，拖回渔船；从砖瓦乱飞的黑夜里，转移了粮食；从山洪底下，保住了良田、水库。
    百万军民，用这十七个闪闪发光的大字，创造了惊天动地的业绩……。
    利埕村被洪水困住了，一千多名群众生死不明。解放军某部排长杨昌亨，班长屠忠洪、吴国珍，前去侦察抢救。他们刚走出不远，就被一股三百多米宽的激流挡住了。这里正是两河入海的汇集点。绕道一千多米，从上游走？不能，现在一秒钟都关系到人民的生命财产的安全。“为人民不怕牺牲，冲过去！”他们一个个跃入水中。一连三个浪头，眼看把屠忠洪卷向大海。就在这时候，屠忠洪脑子里闪出了这十七个闪闪发光的大字，顿时力气倍增，浑身是劲，向利埕村奋力游去。
    一条渔船，眼看要被狂浪吞没，海军某部“海上猛虎艇”几次准备靠上去系缆绳，都失败了。怎么办？他们看看语录牌上写着的闪闪发光的十七个大字，再上！说时迟那时快，当舰艇向渔船接近的一瞬间，副指导员戴学明纵身跃上渔船，胜利地把渔船抢救回来。
    百万军民脑子里刻上了这十七个闪闪发光的大字，哪里风浪最猛，他们就冲向哪里。一千多米高的官岭顶峰上的电线被刮断了，急需把它接通。通往顶峰的一条羊肠小道，山壁陡峭，风急路滑，人一不小心，就会被风推下山坑。赤溪大队民兵杨享秀、傅江贵和陈徐田三人，抢过了这个任务。他们攀悬崖爬陡壁，身不转，头不回，勇往直前。当他们被风刮倒往下滑的时候，他们就吸足气，猛地跃起，继续往上爬，苦战四十多个回合，终于爬上官岭顶峰，接通电话线。他们说：“脑子里有了毛泽东思想，台风再大也是纸老虎。”“听了毛主席的话，就是刀山，我们也敢上！”
    三
    “……关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。”毛主席这一教导，在抗击“三害”的搏斗中成了百万军民共同行动的准则，闪耀出灿烂的光辉。
    当国家、集体和个人的财产，同时受到破坏的时刻，百万军民自觉地，本能地首先抢救国家和集体的财物。有的在自己房子倒塌的时候，去抢救国家的粮食，奔向海边保护海堤……。
    海军某部发电厂厂长周崇修，带着战士在暴风雨中检修电线，路过家门，看到自己的屋顶被台风掀掉，战士们为他着急，周崇修却手往山坡一指说：“抢修高压电线，快！”头也不回，就率领战士奔向山坡。这一天，周崇修八次经过家门口，每次都看到自己房屋被破坏得越来越厉害，但他一脚也没踏进家门，总是说：“现在最要紧的，是抢救人民的生命财产。”
    浪头一两丈高的海啸，向陆军某部机枪连扑来。战士们完全可以爬上紧靠后面的山头。可是，他们却喊着“宁愿自己死，也要人民生”，向一个生产队冲去。战士李计友一连救出五个社员，喘息未定，水上又漂来一个少年抱着一个小孩，时漂时沉，万分危急。这时李计友闪电一般地下定决心：为人民而死，死得其所，要当泰山，不做鸿毛。顿时浑身是劲，向那个少年游去。全连搏斗三个小时，抢出落水社员一百二十多人。
    在天昏，风急，浪高的黄歧半岛上，半山大队共青团支部书记林振兴，一连抢救出三个同志，已经精疲力尽。就在这时，生产队长被风浪卷走了，于是他拚命向队长游去，浪头几次把他顶回来，他几次奋力游上去，硬是要靠近队长。当他靠近了生产队长时，身上一点力气也没有了，但他不顾个人安危，毅然地把自己手中唯一的一根竹竿塞到队长手中，自己却被海浪吞没，为抢救阶级兄弟而光荣牺牲。
    就这样，用毛泽东思想统一起来的百万军民，前赴后继，英勇顽强，赢得了抗击台风、海啸、暴洪的伟大胜利。
    四
    “三害”被制服了。但是，抗灾斗争并没有停止。百万军民又掀起了一个空前规模的争取丰收的大生产运动。
    纵横几百公里的福建东部沿海和山区，从城镇到农村，到处是劳动的歌声，到处是一片热气腾腾的景象。百万军民一个决心：“变大灾之年为丰收之年”。风还没有停止，渔民已经扬帆出海追捕鱼群；山洪，海水刚从田里退完，社员们就把被淹的秧苗用淡水浇了一遍；天刚放晴，人们就在山坡上开垦了一片片新茶园。被冲坏的海堤，很快就全部修复，农作物也追施了一次到三次肥料。
    在恢复生产，重建家园的新的斗争中，用毛泽东思想统一起来的百万军民，通过抗击“三害”的锻炼，共产主义思想大大发扬，出现了“一户有困难，四邻来相帮，一处受灾，八方支援”的动人场面。
    闽侯县闽侯中学的二十九名学生，带着粮食、炊具和生产用具，急行军一百多里，赶到受灾的罗源县泥田大队，并立即投入抗灾生产。
    灾后，与人民群众并肩作战的解放军指战员们扛着毛主席语录牌，带着工具和干粮，再一次来到灾区，帮助群众排海水，修海堤，盖房子。他们来时不报到，去时不留名。社员们说：“他们真是毛主席的好战士。”
    五
    台风滚蛋了，海啸低头了，山洪制服了，生产恢复了。当百万军民进行战斗总结时，都说伟大的胜利来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。他们无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜毛主席，当接到台风即将登陆的警报后，做的第一件事就是把毛主席像包在雨衣里，把毛主席著作揣在胸口上，把毛主席语录板放到最安全的地方。西兰公社畲族女社员兰兴俤，从刮得快倒的房子跑出来时，双手只捧一张毛主席像，别的什么也没有拿。她说：“解放前，咱畲族人民受苦最深，是毛主席把咱从火坑里救出来的，给咱幸福生活。毛主席是咱救命恩人，毛泽东思想是咱的命根子。今天，我损失点东西不要紧，有了毛泽东思想就有了一切。”修好了房子，她一进家门，就满怀喜悦心情，把毛主席像挂起来。
    “毛泽东思想是咱们的命根子，有了毛泽东思想就有了一切。”表达了百万军民的贴心话。这是他们取得抗灾胜利的唯一的源泉。
