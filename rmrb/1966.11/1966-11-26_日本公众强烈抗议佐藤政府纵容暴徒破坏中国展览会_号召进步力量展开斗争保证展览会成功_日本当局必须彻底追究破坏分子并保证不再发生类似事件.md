The All-Japan Cooperation Committee for the Economic and Trade Exhibition of the People's Republic of China, the Central Japan Cooperation Committee, and various democratic organizations in Japan have issued statements or made speeches in recent days, strongly protesting the Sato government's tolerance of right-wing groups and thugs who disrupted and vandalized the Chinese exhibition in Nagoya on the 22nd.

The All-Japan Cooperation Committee for the Economic and Trade Exhibition of the People's Republic of China held an emergency expanded meeting of its standing directors in Tokyo on the 24th. Chairman Kawase Kazuo pointed out at the meeting that the right-wing group's thugs disrupting the Chinese exhibition is a serious incident aimed at obstructing and sabotaging the friendly relations and trade between China and Japan. He stated that in order to ensure the success of the exhibition, all reactionary forces' obstruction and sabotage activities must be overcome.

The resolution passed at the meeting pointed out that on the day after the incident, the 23rd, the number of visitors to the Chinese exhibition exceeded 200,000, which shows the broad support and welcome of the Japanese people for the Chinese exhibition.

The Central Japan Cooperation Committee for the Chinese Exhibition held an emergency meeting of its standing directors on the 23rd and unanimously passed a statement strongly protesting and condemning the Sato government's tolerance of right-wing groups disrupting and vandalizing the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition, as well as the Japanese police's use of violence against Chinese personnel and other illegal acts.

The statement said that the attitude of the Japanese police authorities is absolutely unacceptable. The police authorities must immediately admit their mistake and apologize, punish the police and their superiors who harmed the Chinese exhibition team members, thoroughly investigate the right-wing vandals, and take appropriate measures to ensure that there will be no more interference with the Chinese exhibition in the future.

The headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) issued a statement on the 24th pointing out that the right-wing group's violence is a result of the Japanese government's policy of hostility towards China.

Vice Chairman Kenji Kameda of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation said that this incident is absolutely unacceptable. The Japanese government must take full responsibility for this incident. Vice Chairman Minoru Takahashi of the All-Japan Metalworkers' Union said, "The Japanese reactionaries are afraid that the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition will be successful, and the right-wing group's sabotage is a planned action by the Japanese reactionaries." He pointed out that the progressive forces in Japan must strongly protest and fight against the Japanese police's illegal actions and regard this struggle as an important action to develop the friendly cause between the peoples of China and Japan.

Commissioner Toshimatsu Banba of the Asian-African Solidarity Committee of Japan said that the Japanese police's use of violence against the Chinese exhibition team is completely illegal and unacceptable.

On the 23rd, Chairman Risho Hori of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation expressed great indignation at the Japanese authorities' repeated tolerance of right-wing groups disrupting and vandalizing the Chinese exhibition.

On the 23rd, Secretary-General Tomomi Narita and International Secretary Kazuichi Yamamoto of the Japan Socialist Party submitted a request to the Japanese Cabinet Secretariat Chief Aichi Kisei, demanding that the Sato government punish the police who used violence against the Chinese exhibition team members and take measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

On the same day, Chairman Kenichiro Tanaka of the Central Japan Cooperation Committee for the Chinese Exhibition, Socialist Party Diet member Yoshiaki Yokoyama, and Socialist Party Aichi Prefecture Chairman Kazuo Ota all went to the Aichi Prefectural Police Headquarters to protest.

The Osaka Cooperation Committee for the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition also held a protest meeting on the 24th, strongly condemning the Sato government's tolerance of right-wing groups disrupting the Chinese exhibition.
