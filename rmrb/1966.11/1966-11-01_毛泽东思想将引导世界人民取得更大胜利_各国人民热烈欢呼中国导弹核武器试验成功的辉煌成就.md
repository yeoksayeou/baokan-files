	People's Daily Comprehensive Report: People around the world have enthusiastically celebrated China's great victory in successfully launching nuclear missiles.

	The director of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe in Japan, Seishiro Shimizu, said, "This is a piece of great news for all anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist revolutionary people and all oppressed people around the world. All the members of the troupe were extremely excited upon hearing this news and shouted, 'Long live Chairman Mao!'"

	Seishiro Shimizu said, "China's development in nuclear testing over the past two years has been unprecedented in the world. This is a new victory in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

	On the 29th, Mrs. Tegah Gunawadana, a renowned peace activist from Ceylon, gave a written statement to the Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Colombo, saying: "The successful launch of China's nuclear missile test is not only a victory for the Chinese people but also a great victory for all anti-imperialist forces in the world. It is a powerful weapon for defending world peace."

	She said, "This new achievement shows that 'Chairman Mao's thoughts have generated tremendous power and influence among the people.'"

	Abdul Rahman Abukus, a Syrian figure and secretary of the Asian-African Journalists Association, told the Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "This achievement of China is the result of the Chinese people studying Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions. This is a great achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao."

	Mancanda, a friend from India and secretary of the Britain-Vietnam Solidarity Front in London, said: "This is very exciting news. It is a major blow to the anti-China conspiracies of American imperialists and Soviet revisionists. It is also a direct blow to the Manila Conference."

	He pointed out: "This historic event also demonstrates the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have greatly demonstrated their creative genius in strengthening national defense."

	Ahmed Ibrahim, a representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), said: "The successful test of China's nuclear missile is a great achievement of the people armed with Chairman Mao's thoughts. We believe that Chairman Mao's thoughts will guide us to greater victories in dealing with the dying imperialism and old and new colonialism. Long live the people's missiles! Long live the Chinese people! Long live Chairman Mao's thoughts!"

	Ali Mohammed Osoble, General Secretary and Member of Parliament of the Somali Socialist National Congress, said: "We wish Chairman Mao, who has made great contributions to the world, eternal life." He said: "Because the Chinese people listen to Chairman Mao, resolutely support the people in struggle, especially the Vietnamese people, the people of the world are even more pleased with this achievement. Western countries try to monopolize everything and do not want to see any achievements of the Chinese people. However, we are grateful for this test."

	A British worker said: "The world is extremely excited about the great achievements made by the Chinese people in such a short period. Only under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought can such achievements be made." He said, "Progressive people around the world support China's position on nuclear weapons."
