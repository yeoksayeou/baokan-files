Remember the Truth That "Chicken Feathers Can Fly to the Sky"

Chairman Mao said: "'Chicken feathers cannot fly to the sky' is an ancient truth, but in the socialist era, it is no longer a truth. The poor will rise up. The old system will perish, and a new system will emerge. Chicken feathers will indeed fly to the sky."

We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Nan Cuizhuang, were truly destitute in the old society. In 1953, when we established the cooperative, our land was infertile, our livestock was weak, and our tools were scarce. Transporting fertilizer and crops was mostly done by hand and by pulling. At that time, some well-off middle peasants mocked us, saying we were running a "poor cooperative" with "grasshopper donkeys." They even publicly declared, "Beggars want to start a cooperative, they've never seen chicken feathers fly to the sky." Under the guidance of the party branch, relying on revolutionary spirit and hardworking hands, we gradually changed the face of the "poor cooperative," proving the great truth that "chicken feathers can fly to the sky."

After the establishment of the advanced cooperative, the poor and lower-middle peasants actively advocated for the reclamation of saline-alkali land. Some well-off middle peasants blew cold wind again: "Saline-alkali land can be reclaimed, our ancestors have already done it, and it won't happen in our generation." This is still the old tune of "not seeing chicken feathers fly to the sky." We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, with a spirit of self-reliance, worked hard for two years and built a drainage system in the low-lying saline-alkali land. The groundwater level quickly dropped, and the area of saline-alkali land gradually decreased. What our ancestors could not do, we have accomplished, once again proving the great truth that "chicken feathers can fly to the sky."

Due to some party members and cadres believing that the well-off middle peasants had superior production techniques and were "crop experts," for a period, the well-off middle peasants held the leadership in production techniques. As a result, improved seeds could not be promoted, and technology could not be improved, affecting the development of production. This belief in the production techniques of the well-off middle peasants and disbelief in the poor and lower-middle peasants is essentially the idea of "not seeing chicken feathers fly to the sky" at work. The party branch led everyone to study Chairman Mao's comments on the article "Who Says Chicken Feathers Cannot Fly to the Sky," raising awareness. Thus, relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, we conducted extensive scientific experiments and comprehensively improved farming techniques, achieving a significant increase in grain production. Once again, we proved the great truth that "chicken feathers can fly to the sky."

The past ten years have been a decade of struggle between the two viewpoints of whether chicken feathers can fly to the sky or not, a decade of struggle between two roads. Each time a struggle is won, people's thoughts are elevated, and the team's production advances. Whenever we think of Chairman Mao's comments that chicken feathers will fly to the sky, we are filled with confidence and strength. Every victory of Nan Cuizhuang Brigade, in the end, is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 牢记“鸡毛能上天”的真理

    牢记“鸡毛能上天”的真理
    河南省安阳县南崔庄大队党支部书记　崔凤梧
    毛主席说：“‘鸡毛不能上天’这个古代的真理，在社会主义时代，它已经不是真理了。穷人要翻身了。旧制度要灭亡，新制度要出世了。鸡毛确实要上天了。”
    我们南崔庄的贫下中农，在旧社会真正是穷得叮当响。一九五三年办社时，我们土地薄，牲口弱，工具缺。送粪运庄稼，大部分靠手推人拉。当时一些富裕中农讽刺我们办的是“穷大社”，使的是“蚂蚱驴”，还公开扬言：“穷光蛋想办合作社哩，没有见过鸡毛能上天。”在党支部教育下，靠着革命的志气，靠着勤劳的双手，逐步改变了“穷大社”的面貌，证明了“鸡毛能上天”的伟大真理。
    高级合作化后，贫下中农积极要求改造盐碱地，一些富裕中农又在吹冷风：“盐碱地能改造，老祖宗早办了，还能临到咱这辈”。这还是“没有见过鸡毛能上天”的老调。我们贫下中农，发挥自力更生的革命精神，大干了两年，就在低洼盐碱地上建成了排水系统，地下水位很快降低，盐碱地面积逐步缩小。老祖宗没有办到的我们这一辈办到了，又一次证明了
  “鸡毛能上天”的伟大真理。
    由于我们有些党员和干部，迷信富裕中农的生产技术高，是“庄稼精”，在一段时间里，富裕中农掌握了生产技术的领导权。结果良种不能推广，技术不能改进，影响了生产的发展。这种在生产技术方面迷信富裕中农，不相信贫下中农，实质上还是
  “没有见过鸡毛能上天”的思想在作怪。党支部就领导大家学习毛主席为《谁说鸡毛不能上天》一文所写的按语，提高了觉悟，于是依靠贫下中农，大搞科学实验，全面改进耕作技术，使粮食得到大幅度增产。再一次证明了“鸡毛能上天”的伟大真理。
    过去的十年，是鸡毛能上天还是不能上天这两个观点斗争的十年，是两条道路斗争的十年。每经过一次斗争，人们的思想就提高一步，队里的生产也就前进一步。大家一想起毛主席写的鸡毛要上天的按语，就充满了信心和力量。南崔庄大队的每一个胜利，说到底，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。
