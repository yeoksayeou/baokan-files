The masses have great creative power. The saying "Three cobblers with their wits combined
Exceed the skill of Zhuge Liang" means that the masses have great creative power. Among the
Chinese people, there are indeed tens of thousands of "Zhuge Liang." In every village and every
town, there are "Zhuge Liang" there. We should go among the masses, learn from them, and
combine their experiences into better, more systematic theories and methods. Then, we should
tell the masses (propagate) and call on them to implement these methods to solve the masses'
problems, liberate them, and bring them happiness.

We have been cadres for more than ten years, but it is only in recent years, after seriously
studying Chairman Mao's works, that we have frequently thought about the issue of believing in
and relying on the masses. Recently, we have reread Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Organize
them," and reflecting on the experiences and lessons of the past ten years, we have come to
understand more deeply the profound and great significance of Chairman Mao's teachings on
"the masses have great creative power."

The laboring people are the most wise

Over the past ten years, the members of the Yinxi Brigade in Fucheng County, Fujian Province,
have listened to Chairman Mao's words and, with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong,
removed dozens of small hills, filled hundreds of abandoned ponds and ditches, transformed
thousands of acres of low-yielding fields, built hundreds of water conservancy projects, and
turned a place that was once plagued by droughts and floods and lagging in production into a
flat, drought- and flood-resistant, water- and dry-land rotating, triple-cropping, high-yielding
Dazhai-style advanced unit.

Every construction project in our brigade is a manifestation of the wisdom of the masses, and
every victory is the result of following Chairman Mao's teachings and taking the mass line.

In the first year of cooperation, we wanted to thoroughly uproot poverty and build a water
conservancy project on a barren slope. The rich middle peasants strongly opposed it, saying:
"Since ancient times, it has never been heard of that water flows uphill. It's better to do a bit of
business than to do this thankless job." At that time, we had no money, no technology, what
should we do? We went among the masses, discussed with the poor and lower-middle peasants,
and studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "On Practice" with them. Poor peasant Wu
Wumei said: "With the Party, with Chairman Mao, with the cooperative, what can't we do?"
Many poor and lower-middle peasants offered us advice: no loans, no subsidies, just rely on
everyone's hands and shoulders. Truly, "Three cobblers with their wits combined exceed the
skill of Zhuge Liang." With no funds, we went up the mountain to engage in sideline
production to increase our cash income; with no technology, we sent people to other places to
learn; with no cement, we burned shell ash ourselves; with no stones, we went to the bottom of
the stream to fish for them, and carried them from dozens of miles away. Originally, it was
planned to take five years and 57,000 yuan to complete; in the end, it only took a few thousand
yuan and six months to build this water conservancy project. The water really flowed uphill,
and the rich middle peasants were convinced.

Yinxi Brigade is a place with many people and little land. We often looked at the large pebble
beach in front of Xiqian and Xiasheng villages and thought: "If that could be turned into
cultivated land, Yinxi could plant another hundred acres of crops every year." When we went
there to work with the masses, we found that what we had in mind was already beginning to
happen there. The Guo Tianshun production team had long had experience in enclosing streams
to create fields, and they had opened more than an acre of land on the stream bank, where the
crops grew very well. We held a meeting there, and the entire brigade immediately launched a
campaign to enclose streams and create fields, and in just one winter and spring, more than a
hundred acres of cultivated land were opened.

Facts have repeatedly taught us: the laboring masses, especially the broad poor and lower-middle
peasants, are the vanguard, the pioneers, and the main force in the three great revolutionary
movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. They are the
most courageous, the most diligent, and the most wise. Without them, nothing can be done. The
changes in Yinxi Brigade are the result of developing step by step under the guidance of Mao
Zedong Thought, relying on the wisdom of the masses and the spirit of self-reliance. Today's
Yinxi has crisscrossing irrigation channels that have reached the barren hills of the past; wide
paths between fields have replaced the narrow paths of the past; electric water pumps, rice
hullers, wheat grinders, and oil presses have replaced the heavy water wheels, wooden
mortars, and stone mills of the past. Lush sugarcane and orchards have appeared on the past
stream banks and slopes. In the past, we poor and lower-middle peasants lived in low,
thatched huts, and today we have built new houses, hospitals, schools, factories, and
warehouses ourselves. The great changes in Yinxi Brigade prove: the people, and only the
people, are the motive force of world history.

Cadres must combine with the masses

We used to feel that we were cadres, understood policies, had experience, and had many
methods. But when we encountered key problems, we often had no solution and could not make
decisions. Sometimes, we hastily made decisions and often encountered setbacks. Why? The
main reason is that we substituted our subjective views for objective reality and detached
ourselves from reality and the masses. Later, we overcame this flaw and achieved good results.

This summer, more than two thousand acres of early rice ripened almost simultaneously and
needed to be harvested immediately; more than three hundred acres of late rice seedlings also
needed to be transplanted on time; various agricultural tasks were all crowded together. We
were very anxious and immediately convened a meeting of the brigade's production team leaders,
poor and lower-middle peasant association chairmen, and women cadres, proposing several
methods to solve this problem. But we thought: although there are many grassroots cadres, they
are still a minority compared to the masses. Only by listening to the opinions of the broad
masses can our leadership thoughts be in line with reality. The masses will implement what we
cadres agree to, but the masses may not agree, and how can they do a good job if they are asked
to do something they disagree with? So, we handed this problem over to the masses. The
masses discussed it and came up with more active solutions. They made more than a hundred
grain-carrying carts themselves and installed twenty electric threshers, greatly improving
labor efficiency. As a result, not only was the season not delayed, but the summer harvest and
planting tasks were also completed ahead of schedule.

In his brilliant work "Organize them," Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists should
experience storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of the masses' struggle, and
this world is the great world of the masses' struggle." Communists should do this, and all cadres
and experts should do the same.

Lin Hongda, a young intellectual who has settled in our Yinxi Brigade, is a university student
and also a student of agriculture. When he first came, the masses called him a "foreign expert."
Once, he went to Longtian Commune to learn about sweet potato planting methods and returned
to tell us that Longtian Commune used the method of wide ridges, sparse plants, and flat
planting to plant sweet potatoes, and asked if it could be promoted in Yinxi. We decided to
first promote it in three hundred acres. However, because we did not consider that Longtian is
sandy soil and Yinxi is clay soil, we blindly promoted their experience, resulting in the sweet
potatoes growing very small, and the community members had many complaints.

After Lin Hongda encountered this setback, he actively studied Chairman Mao's works. Through
study, he understood that intellectuals must learn well from the masses and combine with the
masses to do a good job. Since then, he has been among the masses, rolling in the mud, and
combining with the old farmers and cadres. Over the past ten years, he has created a complete
set of water- and dry-land rotating, intercropping high-yield experience with the masses, which
has been welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Recently, Lin Hongda said happily
while studying and discussing "Organize them" with us: "I have only now truly understood what
science is and how to do science. If I leave the masses and leave practice, there is no science."

Use the "Three Articles" to transform oneself

Going among the masses and being a student of the masses is easy to say but hard to do. When
encountering difficulties and setbacks, one can still pay attention to this. But once there are
achievements and praise from the leadership, one often forgets the masses and only sees
oneself, always thinking that one's opinions are correct. Over the past ten years, Yinxi Brigade
has continuously achieved increased production and income, and has been praised by the
leadership every year, so this aspect has been particularly prominent.

Last year, the brigade expanded the oil mill. We thought of many ways to complete the project
ahead of schedule and saved four thousand yuan. We thought that this time the masses should be
satisfied. But when we went there, we found that the air was not good and the light was not
sufficient, and the masses had to work with lights during the day, so the masses criticized us,
and we immediately improved it and made a firm decision: to consult with the masses on all
matters in the future.

Recently, we have studied the "Three Articles," opened the door for rectification, eliminated
"selfishness" and established "publicness," exposed our thoughts to the masses, and conducted
self-criticism. We have realized that if we do not overcome the "self," we will not establish the
thought of "completely and thoroughly" serving the people, and we will only see ourselves and
not see the masses. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, forever be students of the
masses, temper ourselves in the great storms of the masses' struggles, forever be with the
masses, share their joys and sorrows, and strive for greater victories.

    群众有伟大的创造力
    福建省福清县音西公社音西大队党总支书记　陈德顺
    “三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮”，这就是说，群众有伟大的创造力。中国人民中间，实在有成千成万的“诸葛亮”，每个乡村，每个市镇，都有那里的“诸葛亮”。我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来，成为更好的有条理的道理和办法，然后再告诉群众（宣传），并号召群众实行起来，解决群众的问题，使群众得到解放和幸福。
    我们当了十多年干部，但相信群众、依靠群众这个问题，还是近年来认真学习毛主席著作后，才经常放在脑子里思考的。最近我们重读毛主席《组织起来》这篇光辉著作，联想十多年来的经验教训，更深刻地认识到毛主席关于“群众有伟大的创造力”的教导，有着多么深刻的伟大意义。
      劳动人民最有智慧
      十多年来，我们音西大队的社员听毛主席的话，用愚公移山的精神，搬走了几十座小山丘，填平了数百处废池、废沟，改造了千多亩低产田，修了上百处水利工程，将原来是旱涝不断、生产落后的地方，建设成为一个地势平坦，旱涝保收，水旱轮作，一年三熟，项项高产的大寨式先进单位。
    我们的每一处建设都是群众智慧的体现，每一个胜利都是按照毛主席的教导走群众路线的结果。
    合作化头一年，我们为了彻底挖掉穷根，要在荒坡修一个水利工程，那些富裕中农极力反对，他们说：自古以来没有听说水往高处流，干这吃力不讨好的事情，还不如去搞点小买卖。当时，我们要钱没钱，要技术没技术，咋办？我们到群众中去，同贫下中农商量，同他们一起学习《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》。贫农吴乌妹说：“有党，有毛主席，有合作社，什么事情干不成？”许多贫下中农向我们出谋献策：一不靠贷款，二不靠补助，就靠每人一双手，一副肩膀。真是“三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮”。没有资金，我们上山搞副业，增加现金收入；没有技术，派人到外地参观学习；没有水泥，自己烧壳灰；没有石头，下溪底去捞，到几十里外的山上去挑。原来计划要五万七千元钱，三年时间，才能修成；结果只花几千元，干六个月，就建成了这一处水利工程。水真的往高处流了，富裕中农也服气了。
    音西大队是个人多地少的地方。我们常常对着溪前、下盛两个自然村那一大片鹅卵石滩想：“要是那里能变成耕地，那音西每年又可以扩种百来亩庄稼了。”当我们到那里同群众一起劳动时，发现我们所想的已开始在那里变成现实。郭天顺生产队老早就有围溪造田的经验，他们在溪滩开了一亩多地，庄稼长得很好。我们在那里召开了一个现场会，全大队立即掀起围溪造田的热潮，只用一个冬春，就开出一百多亩耕地。
    事实一再教育我们：劳动群众，特别是广大贫下中农，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，是急先锋，是闯将，是主力军。他们最勇敢，最勤劳，最有智慧。离开了他们，什么事情也办不成。我们音西大队的变化，就是在毛泽东思想指引下，靠群众的智慧，靠自力更生的精神，一步一步地发展起来的。今天的音西，纵横交错的灌溉渠道，伸进了过去的瘦地荒坡；宽阔的田间大道，代替了过去的羊肠小径；电动抽水机、碾米机、磨麦机和榨油机，代替了过去笨重的水车、木砻和石碾。茂密的甘蔗、果林，在过去的溪滩、坡地出现了。过去，我们贫下中农住的是低矮的茅舍，今天自己动手盖起了新的住宅、医院、学校、厂房和仓库……。音西大队的巨变说明了：人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。
    干部要同群众相结合
    我们过去总感到自己是干部，懂政策，有经验，办法多。可是，一碰到关键问题，往往束手无策，拿不出主意，有时匆忙拿出主意，又常常碰钉子。为什么呢？主要是主观代替客观，脱离实际、脱离群众。以后，我们克服了这个毛病，收到了良好效果。
    今年夏季，二千多亩早稻几乎是同时黄熟，要马上抢收；三百多亩晚稻秧也必须按时栽插；各种农活都挤在一起。我们很着急，连忙召开了全大队生产队长、贫协主任、妇女干部会议，提出了几个办法解决这个问题。但是我们想：基层干部虽多，比起群众来，毕竟还是少数。只有倾听广大群众的意见，领导思想才能符合实际。事情要群众来办，我们干部同意了的意见，群众不一定同意，让群众去干自己不同意的事，怎么能干好呢。于是，我们把这个问题交给群众。群众一讨论，提出了更积极的解决办法。他们自己动手制造了一百多辆运谷板车，安装了二十部电动脱谷机，大大提高了劳动效率。结果不但没有耽误季节，反而提前完成了夏收夏种任务。
    毛主席在《组织起来》这篇光辉著作中教导我们：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”共产党员要这样做，一切干部、专家也都应该如此。
    在我们音西大队安家落户的知识青年林鸿达，是大学生，又是学农的，刚来时群众称他“洋专家”。有一次他到龙田公社参观学习种甘薯的经验回来，我们问他，龙田公社采用畦大、株疏、平插的方法种植甘薯，在音西能不能推广，他一口肯定说能。我们就决定先推广三百亩。但是，由于没有考虑人家龙田是沙质地，我们音西是粘质地，盲目推行人家的经验，结果，甘薯长的很小，社员意见很大。
    林鸿达碰了这个钉子以后，积极学习毛主席著作。通过学习，他懂得了知识分子要做好工作，必须很好地向群众学习，同群众相结合。以后一直在群众中，在泥巴里滚，同老农、干部相结合。十多年来，他同群众一起，创造了一整套水旱轮种、套种的稳产高产经验，受到了贫下中农的欢迎。最近林鸿达同我们一起学习讨论《组织起来》这篇著作时高兴地说：“我现在才真正懂得什么是科学，怎样搞科学。如果离开了群众，离开了实践，那就没有科学。”
      用“老三篇”来改造自己
    到群众中去，当群众的小学生，这个问题说起来容易，做起来不容易。遇到困难，碰了钉子，还能注意这样做。但是一当有了成绩，受到领导上赞扬时，又往往会忘记了群众，只看到自己，总觉得自己的意见正确。十多年来，音西大队连续取得增产增收，年年受到领导上表扬，因此在这方面表现得特别突出。
    去年，大队扩建了榨油厂，我们想了许多办法，使工程提早完成，还节省了四千元钱。我们想，这一下群众该满意了。可是到那里一看，空气不好，光线不足，白天工作还要点灯，群众提出了批评，我们立即改进，并下定决心：今后凡事和群众商量。
    最近，我们大学“老三篇”，开门整风，破“私”立“公”，向群众亮思想，进行自我批评。我们认识到，不斗倒“我”字，不树立“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想，就会只看到自己，看不到群众。我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，永远当群众的小学生，在群众斗争的大风雨里锻炼自己。永远与群众在一起，同呼吸，共甘苦，争取更大胜利。
