    毛主席启发了世界人民的智慧
    据新华社加德满都二十二日电　尼泊尔观众在这里举行的中国无产阶级文化大革命图片展览会上，表示对毛主席的无限热爱，并热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵。这个展览会从十九日至二十一日举行了三天。
    一位参观者阿查里雅在留言簿上写道：“毛主席像早晨的红太阳，把被压迫人民从苦难中解救出来，启发了全世界人民的智慧。”另一位参观者沙阿写道：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的灯塔，而且也是全世界人民的灯塔。在毛主席的领导下，世界人民一定能把帝国主义者、反动派和现代修正主义者清除掉。”还有许多观众热情洋溢地写道：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    许多观众欢呼中国的无产阶级文化大革命。一位参观者巴塔拉伊写道：“目前在中国开展的无产阶级文化大革命，在向共产主义过渡方面起着重要的作用。”他说：“没有文化革命运动，社会主义国家就不能完全消灭资本主义思想，就要走向错误的方向。对于受资产阶级思想之害的全体被压迫和被剥削的人民说来，中国的无产阶级文化大革命是重要的指针。中国的无产阶级文化大革命将继续胜利进行到底。”
    观众还热烈赞扬红卫兵。一位名叫纳拉扬的参观者写道：红卫兵教育了世界人民，我们万分感谢他们。另一位参观者布拉马说：“为了铲除帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派，为了建设社会主义，在通向共产主义的道路前进，伟大的战士红卫兵的行动是值得称赞的。”
