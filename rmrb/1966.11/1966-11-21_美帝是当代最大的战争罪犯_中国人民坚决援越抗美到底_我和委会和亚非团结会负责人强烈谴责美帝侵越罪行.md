The U.S. is the Greatest War Criminal of the Contemporary Era
The Chinese People Resolutely Support Vietnam in Resisting the U.S. to the End
The Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament and the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity Strongly Condemn U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, a responsible person from the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament made a statement today, expressing resolute support for the just stance of the Vietnam Democratic Republic's Committee for Investigating U.S. Imperialist War Crimes in Vietnam in its October 31st statement. They strongly condemn the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people.

The responsible person from the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the greatest and most brutal war criminal of the contemporary era. It has committed countless crimes against the Vietnamese people, far surpassing the atrocities of German fascism and Japanese militarism. He said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's recent call to the nation's military and civilians fully expresses the unshakable will of the 31 million Vietnamese people to resist aggression, and is the loudest response to the U.S. imperialists' peace fraud.

He emphasized that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and U.S. imperialism are actively working together on "joint actions," eagerly serving the U.S. imperialists' peace fraud, providing false support and true betrayal to the Vietnamese people. Their evil deeds will not save U.S. imperialism from its inevitable defeat, nor can they deceive the Vietnamese people who persist and are skilled in struggle. The result will be that they will lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet, and they will not have a good ending.

The responsible person from the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament finally said, "The Chinese people will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, support the Vietnamese people's just struggle, and fight to the end against U.S.-led imperialism and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership clique. U.S. imperialism must get out of Vietnam!"

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, a responsible person from the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity made a statement today, saying that the Vietnam Democratic Republic's Committee for Investigating U.S. Imperialist War Crimes in Vietnam issued a statement on October 31st, severely condemning the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam, and resolutely continuing the struggle against the U.S. to save the nation. The Chinese people firmly support the Vietnamese people's just stance.

This responsible person said, "U.S. imperialism is the most vicious and brutal enemy of all peoples of the world. Its brutal war crimes in the Vietnam aggression have aroused severe condemnation from the peoples of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving peoples of the world. However, the Soviet leadership clique identifies enemies as friends, striving to collaborate with U.S. imperialism in the Vietnam issue to carry out the conspiracy of 'forcing peace through war.' Their actions fully expose their traitorous faces and can only make the peoples of the world see more clearly their accomplice faces, but they will never save U.S. imperialism from its inevitable defeat.

This responsible person said, "At present, the situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S. to save the nation is very good and getting better. The Chinese people's resolute support for the Vietnamese people's stance of continuing the struggle against the U.S. to save the nation to the end is unshakable."

    美帝是当代最大的战争罪犯
    中国人民坚决援越抗美到底
    我和委会和亚非团结会负责人强烈谴责美帝侵越罪行
    据新华社二十日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会负责人今天发表谈话，表示坚决支持越南民主共和国调查美帝国主义在越南的战争罪行委员会十月三十一日声明的正义立场，愤怒谴责美帝国主义对越南人民犯下的滔天罪行。
    中国和委会负责人指出，美帝国主义是当代最大、最凶残的战争罪犯。它对越南人民犯下了罄竹难书的罪行，其残暴程度大大超过了德国法西斯和日本军国主义者。他说，不久前胡志明主席再一次向全国军民发出的号召，充分表达了三千一百万越南人民坚定不移的反抗侵略的钢铁意志，也是对美帝国主义的和谈骗局最响亮的回答。
    他强调指出，苏联修正主义领导集团和美帝国主义大搞“联合行动”，积极奔走为美帝国主义的和谈骗局效劳，对越南人民实行假支持，真出卖，他们的这种罪恶勾当挽救不了美帝国主义一定失败的命运，也骗不了坚持斗争和善于斗争的越南人民，结果必将是搬起石头打自己的脚，是决不会有什么好下场的。
    中国和委会负责人最后说，中国人民将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为支援越南人民的正义斗争，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义而斗争到底。美帝国主义必须从越南滚出去！
    据新华社二十日讯　中国亚非团结委员会负责人今天发表谈话说，越南民主共和国调查美帝国主义在越南的战争罪行委员会十月三十一日发表声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义在越南犯下的滔天罪行，并决心将抗美救国斗争进行到底，中国人民坚决支持越南人民这一正义立场。
    这位负责人说，美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶、最残暴的敌人。它在侵越战争中犯下的残暴的战争罪行，已激起亚非人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的严厉谴责。但是，苏共领导集团却认敌为友，竭力配合美帝国主义在越南问题上搞“以战迫和”的阴谋。他们的这种行为完全暴露了他们的叛徒面目，只能使全世界人民更加认清他们的帮凶嘴脸，而绝挽救不了美帝国主义必然失败的命运。
    这位负责人说，当前越南人民的抗美救国斗争形势好得很，而且越来越好。中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底的立场是坚定不移的。
