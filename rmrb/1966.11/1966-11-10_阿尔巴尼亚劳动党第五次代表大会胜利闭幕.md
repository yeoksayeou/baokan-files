The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour triumphantly concluded this morning amidst the singing of the "Internationale" and a chorus of enthusiastic cheers.

This congress is of great historical significance in the political life of the Albanian Party of Labour and the entire nation. During the congress, over 700 delegates, with immense revolutionary enthusiasm and a high sense of responsibility, listened to and discussed the report on the work of the Central Committee by Comrade Enver Hoxha and the directive on the fourth five-year plan for the development of Albania's economy and culture by Comrade Mehmet Shehu. They then passed the relevant resolutions. The congress determined the program and tasks for the Party's future work; it demonstrated the ironclad unity of the entire Party around the Central Committee led by Comrade Enver Hoxha; it expressed the resolve of the Albanian communists and the entire people to uphold the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, to emphasize proletarian politics, and to carry the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism through to the end.

The delegation of the Communist Party of China, led by Kang Sheng, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat, and Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat, as well as delegations from other communist parties, workers' parties, and Marxist-Leninist organizations attended the closing ceremony.

At today's meeting, the list of 61 full members and 36 alternate members of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, elected by the congress delegates yesterday afternoon, was announced. The list of members and alternate members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, members of the Secretariat, and the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and members of the Central Committee of Inspection and Control of the Albanian Party of Labour, elected at the first plenary meeting of the newly elected Central Committee this morning, was also announced.

When the congress announced that Comrade Enver Hoxha had been re-elected as the First Secretary of the Central Committee, the entire audience stood up and cheered enthusiastically for a long time, expressing the Albanian people's unbounded support and love for their beloved leader and the rock-solid unity of the Party and the people.

Comrade Hoxha then delivered the closing speech.

Comrade Hoxha first, on behalf of all the comrades elected to the Central Committee, expressed gratitude to the congress delegates and all Party members for their great trust and confidence. He pledged that in the future work and struggle, they would not betray this trust and the great honor.

Comrade Hoxha said, "We swear to our heroic Party, to all Party members, and to our dear people: for the cause of the Party and Marxism-Leninism, for the cause of socialism, freedom, and independence of our country, for the cause of proletarian internationalism, and for the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by Khrushchev, we will spare no effort, and if necessary, even sacrifice our lives."

He said, "The Fifth Congress of our Party is a high manifestation of the Party's ironclad unity, indestructible strength, and maturity. It brilliantly demonstrates the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian communists to forge ahead and carry the socialist revolution through to the end. It embodies our Party's loyalty to the invincible teachings of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and our Party's consistent stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and the modern revisionism of Khrushchev and Tito, and our determination to achieve the complete victory of revolution and socialism worldwide."

Comrade Hoxha pointed out that the Fifth Congress proved that, due to the Party of Labour's principled stance and resolute struggle, it has won the respect and affection of all true friends, Marxist-Leninists, and revolutionary forces worldwide who cherish the ideals of freedom, democracy, and socialism. On behalf of all Albanian communists and the entire people, he once again expressed revolutionary thanks to the representatives of the communist parties, workers' parties, and Marxist-Leninist organizations from various countries who were invited to attend the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour. He assured them that the Albanian Party of Labour and people would forever uphold the banner of proletarian internationalism and honorably fulfill their obligations to the common great cause—the victory of the world socialist revolution.

Comrade Hoxha emphasized that the congratulatory message from the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, our beloved comrade Mao Zedong, to the congress, made us, the entire Albanian people and Party, feel boundless joy and inspiration. Chairman Mao's congratulations are a vivid and powerful embodiment of the revolutionary, combative, and unbreakable unity and eternal friendship between the two parties, two peoples, and two countries of Albania and China.

Comrade Hoxha continued, "At the Fifth Congress, our Party once again declared that, whether in good times or in stormy seas, we will resolutely stand with the Communist Party of China, continuously strengthen our great unity and friendship, for the benefit of the peoples of our two countries and for the cause of world freedom and socialism."

Comrade Hoxha said that the congress, in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, correctly determined our path and the great tasks ahead in all aspects of life—both domestic and foreign policy. The congress armed us with a clear and correct program of work and struggle. This is a great victory.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out that the new five-year plan for the development of the national economy and culture discussed and adopted at the congress marks a new giant step for Albania towards building a socialist society. It opens up magnificent prospects for the Albanian people in all aspects. The new five-year plan is a bold, mobilizing, and revolutionary plan, and it is also a completely feasible plan.

Comrade Hoxha stressed the need to strengthen the Party, strengthen the Party's leadership in all aspects of socialist construction, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, resolutely implement the mass line, carry out class struggle, always emphasize the Party's proletarian politics, strengthen the revolutionary class education of the working people, strictly adhere to the principle of self-reliance, enhance the revolutionary vigilance and war preparedness of the armed forces and the entire people, and forever uphold the banners of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

Comrade Hoxha finally called on the entire Party and the people to arm themselves with the historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, to arm themselves with the high revolutionary spirit of the Party, to advance along the path indicated by the Fifth Congress, to turn Albania into an even more invincible bastion of revolution and socialism, to forever uphold the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and to forever be the invincible vanguard in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism.

Comrade Hoxha's closing speech was repeatedly interrupted by long, enthusiastic applause and shouts of "Enver Hoxha," "Party of Labour," and "Enver Hoxha—Party of Labour, we are always ready."

When Comrade Hoxha mentioned in his closing speech the congratulatory message from the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, signed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the delegates stood up three times, giving thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers. The entire audience shouted in unison, "Enver—Mao Zedong," "Long live the Communist Party of China." This once again demonstrated the Albanian Party of Labour and people's fervent admiration and boundless respect for Chairman Mao, and the combative unity and revolutionary friendship between the two parties and peoples of Albania and China.

Before Comrade Hoxha delivered the closing speech, the Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania awarded red banners and certificates to the winners of the socialist labor competition held to welcome the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour and the 25th anniversary of the Party's founding.

The congress finally concluded amidst the singing of the "Internationale" and cheers that lasted for more than twenty minutes.
