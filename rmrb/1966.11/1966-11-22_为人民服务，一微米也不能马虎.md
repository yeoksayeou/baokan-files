A repairman at a certain oil station, Liu Guoyi, spent the entire day fixing an oil pump. By five in the afternoon, he was still working, covered in sweat and oil. He hadn’t even had lunch. He was busy around the motor, showing no signs of fatigue. I urged him to hurry up and go home for a meal. He said, “Don’t rush, I just need to increase the bearing clearance by one micrometer and then I’ll go.” I said, “It’s already dark, is it worth all this effort for just one micrometer? Besides, it won’t affect the normal operation of the pump.” But he told me, “Being meticulous is our consistent style. To be responsible to the people, we must be meticulous.” Hearing Liu’s words, I was deeply moved. Chairman Mao taught us to always put the people’s interests first. My way of thinking did not align with the people’s interests. Neglecting just “one micrometer” means a vast difference in the spirit of serving the people. I joined Liu in the effort to increase the clearance by one micrometer until the task was completed.

    为人民服务，一微米也不能马虎
    维修工　谈文琪
    某油站输油泵进行检修，工长刘国义围着油泵干了一整天，累得汗流满面，一身油泥。已经下午五点钟了，还没吃午饭。他围着电机忙来忙去，没有一点疲劳的样子。我催他快些回去吃饭。他说：“不要着急，轴承间隙再提高一微米就回去。”我说：天已黑了，为一微米值得费那么大劲吗？再说又不影响泵的正常运转。可是他对我说：“认真是咱们一贯的作风，对人民负责就必须认真。”听了老刘的一番话，我很受感动，毛主席教育我们，一切从人民的利益出发。我的这种思想就不合乎人民的利益，忽视的是“一微米”，为人民服务的思想可就相差十万八千里。我和老刘一同投入了为提高一微米的战斗，直到完成了任务。
