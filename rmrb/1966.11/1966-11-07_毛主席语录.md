It is not difficult for a person to do a few good deeds, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, to avoid doing evil, to consistently benefit the broad masses, to consistently benefit the youth, to consistently benefit the revolution, and to struggle hard for decades without wavering. This is truly the most difficult thing!
