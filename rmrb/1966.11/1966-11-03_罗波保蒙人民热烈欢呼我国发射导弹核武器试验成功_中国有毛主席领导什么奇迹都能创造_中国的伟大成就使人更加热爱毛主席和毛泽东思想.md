The people of Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, and Mongolia have enthusiastically celebrated China's successful test of missile and nuclear weapons, pointing out that "this is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

A Romanian cadre excitedly said, "This is a remarkable achievement and a great victory for the Chinese people."

A worker said, "This great achievement by the Chinese people is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists who are intensifying their aggression."

A youth said, "Wonderful! This is your achievement, and it is also ours."

A female university student who was writing a letter to a friend in another city immediately wrote the good news into her letter upon hearing the news.

A Polish clerk congratulated a Chinese friend, saying, "This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao Zedong trusts the people the most. It is precisely because of relying on the people that this great achievement has been made. China's successful nuclear test makes people love Chairman Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought even more." He pointed out that China's test this time proves that China's industrial and scientific and technological level has reached a new height. All the working people in the world are extremely happy about this. The stronger China is, the more secure world peace and the interests of the working people will be.

A staff member of a cultural institution in Warsaw said to a Chinese friend, "This is a great thing. You have achieved great success. This should be attributed to the wise leadership of Mao Zedong."

After learning the news of China's successful test of missile and nuclear weapons, the Bulgarian people expressed their warm congratulations to Chinese comrades on the morning of the 28th, saying, "Excellent, excellent." A clerk said, "China has made great progress in science and technology, which has made new contributions to the defense of world peace." A soldier said, "This is a great support for the Vietnamese people and a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors." An agronomist said, "China has manufactured missiles and nuclear weapons on its own without relying on others, truly a great nation. China's achievement is a great encouragement to the oppressed peoples of the world." A worker said, "China has every reason to master missile and nuclear weapons to consolidate its national defense. I admire China's self-reliance in manufacturing such weapons."

After the news of China's successful test of missile and nuclear weapons reached Ulaanbaatar, the Mongolian people were extremely happy. Every day, Mongolian friends expressed their warm congratulations to Chinese comrades.

A Mongolian worker said, "This is a miracle created by the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought." A Mongolian youth said, "With Chairman Mao leading, China can achieve anything." Some Mongolian friends said, "I will definitely study Mao Zedong Thought well." Some women told their children, "Read Chairman Mao's books and work to promote the friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples when you grow up."

An elderly Mongolian woman happily said, "China has become strong under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Those who slander China will one day be overthrown." She also said, "The great Chairman Mao will always be with the revolutionary people."
