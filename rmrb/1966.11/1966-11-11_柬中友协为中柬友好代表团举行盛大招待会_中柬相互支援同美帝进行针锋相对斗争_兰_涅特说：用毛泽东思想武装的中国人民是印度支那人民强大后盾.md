The Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association's Guidance Committee held a grand reception on the evening of the 8th here for the Chinese-Cambodian Friendship Delegation led by Zhang Qi, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese-Cambodian Friendship Association.

About six hundred people attended the reception.

The banquet hall was brightly lit and decorated like a festival. The orchestra played the music "Salute to China," composed during King Sihanouk's sixth visit to China, and "Song of Sino-Cambodian Friendship," composed by the Chinese Frontline Song and Dance Troupe during their visit to Cambodia last year. When the Chinese-Cambodian Friendship Delegation arrived, they were warmly welcomed by the members of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association's Guidance Committee standing in a line.

At the reception, Lan Neth, President of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association, gave a passionate speech. He said, "This year, the visit of the Chinese-Cambodian Friendship Delegation to Cambodia marks another great step forward in the development of traditional friendship between our two countries. There is no doubt that we all hope this friendship will be strengthened and last forever. No force in the world can weaken this friendship, and no devil can separate us. In the face of threats from war-mongers, aggressors, and American imperialism, we are more united than ever before."

Lan Neth praised the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, as well as the achievements in various fields. He pointed out: "The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the thoughts of the highly respected Chairman Mao Zedong, are a powerful backbone for the people of Indochina and the people of the world in defending peace, an inexhaustible source of progress in science, economy, and culture, and a reason for us to be full of hope for the future, prosperity, and happiness of humanity."

Zhang Qi spoke amid warm applause. She first extended her most sincere greetings and festive wishes to the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association and the Cambodian people.

She said: "American imperialism is persistently pursuing a policy of aggression and war worldwide. Currently, American imperialism is intensifying its aggression against Vietnam, threatening your Cambodia and also threatening our China. Therefore, to firmly grasp our own destiny, the Chinese people and the Cambodian people need to strengthen unity and support each other in a head-on struggle against the common enemy, American imperialism."

Zhang Qi said: "China and Cambodia have always sympathized with and supported each other. The Chinese people will never forget that when American imperialism and its followers were fiercely anti-China, Prince Sihanouk stood up and declared to the world: 'The Cambodian people regard the People's Republic of China as their best friend.' The Chinese people have always unwaveringly supported the Cambodian people in their just struggle against the aggression of American imperialism and its lackeys, defending independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity." She said: "We are willing to reiterate once again: if American imperialism dares to bring the flames of aggression to the peaceful Kingdom of Cambodia, the seven hundred million Chinese people will definitely provide full support to our Cambodian brothers."

Zhang Qi emphasized: "All peace-loving and justice-seeking countries and peoples around the world are pleased to see the strengthening and development of Sino-Cambodian friendship. Only American imperialism and its followers are not pleased. Chairman Mao Zedong teaches us: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' American imperialism opposes Sino-Cambodian friendship, which precisely proves that Sino-Cambodian friendship is a good thing, and we must do it and do it better. The Chinese people must continue to be friends with the Cambodian people for generations to come." She said: "Let the friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Cambodia flow like the Lancang River and the Mekong River, never ceasing, everlasting!"

Those present included: Su Nan, First Vice-Chairman of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association, Hu Ning, Second Vice-Chairman, Secretary-General Pu Cai, and other members of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association. Also present were: Chou Samouth, President of the Cambodian National Assembly, Prince Kantol, Vice-Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Throne, Lan Neth, member of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association and First Vice-President of the National Assembly, Pithana, (National) Secretary of State for Education, Madame Dethina, and other notable figures.

Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Chen Shuliang and his wife, diplomatic officials from the Chinese Embassy, and some members of the Chinese sports delegation to the First Asian New Forces Games also attended the banquet.

The delegation visited the People's Social Alliance Achievement Exhibition in the afternoon of the 8th. Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Mau Say and the Director of the Royal University of Fine Arts, Wang Moli Wang, gave explanations to the delegation. Zhang Qi presented gifts to the People's Social Alliance Exhibition after the visit and signed the guest book.

    中柬相互支援同美帝进行针锋相对斗争
    兰·涅特说：用毛泽东思想武装的中国人民是印度支那人民强大后盾
    据新华社金边九日电　柬埔寨—中国友好协会指导委员会八日晚上在这里为由中国—柬埔寨友好协会副会长张茜率领的中柬友好代表团举行盛大招待会。
    参加招待会的约六百人。
    宴会大厅里灯火辉煌，装饰得像欢庆节日一样。乐队演奏西哈努克第六次访问中国时所谱写的《向中国致敬》的音乐和中国前线歌舞团去年访问柬埔寨时所谱写的《中柬友谊之歌》。当中柬友好代表团到达的时候，受到柬中友好协会指导委员会成员列队热烈欢迎。
    在招待会上，柬中友好协会会长兰·涅特作了热情洋溢的讲话。他说，今年中柬友好代表团访问柬埔寨，标志着我们两国在发展我们两国人民的传统友谊中又向前迈出了巨大的一步。毫无疑问，我们都希望这种友谊巩固和万古长青。世界上任何力量都不能削弱这种友谊，任何魔鬼都不能把我们分开。在战争贩子、侵略者、美帝国主义的威胁面前，我们比以往任何时候都团结得更加紧密。
    兰·涅特赞扬中国文化大革命和红卫兵的革命行动，以及各方面所取得的成就。他指出：“用威望很高的领袖毛泽东主席的思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，是印度支那人民和世界各国人民保卫和平的强大后盾，是在科学、经济和文化方面取得进步的取之不尽的源泉，也是我们对人类的前途、繁荣和幸福充满希望的理由。”
    张茜在热烈的掌声中讲话。她首先向柬中友协和柬埔寨人民，致以最真诚的祝愿和节日的祝贺。
    她说：“美帝国主义在全世界坚持推行侵略政策和战争政策。目前，美帝国主义正在加紧扩大侵略越南的战争，威胁着你们柬埔寨，也威胁着我们中国。因此，为了牢牢地掌握自己的命运，中国人民和柬埔寨人民需要加强团结、相互支援，对共同的敌人美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争。”
    张茜说：“中国和柬埔寨是一贯相互同情、相互支持的。中国人民永远不会忘记，当美帝国主义及其追随者大肆反华的时候，西哈努克亲王挺身而出，向全世界宣布：‘柬埔寨人民把中华人民共和国看作是最好的朋友。’中国人民也始终不渝地支持柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其仆从的侵略，捍卫独立、中立和领土完整的正义斗争。”她说：“我们愿意再一次重申：如果美帝国主义胆敢把侵略战火烧到爱好和平的柬埔寨王国，七亿中国人民一定全力支援兄弟的柬埔寨人民。”
    张茜强调指出：“全世界一切爱好和平、主持正义的国家和人民，都为中柬友谊日益巩固和发展感到高兴。只有美帝国主义及其追随者才不高兴。毛泽东主席教导我们：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’美帝国主义反对中柬友好，这恰恰证明中柬友好是好事，我们一定要做，而且要做得更好。中国人民一定要同柬埔寨人民世世代代友好下去。”她说：“让中柬两国人民的友谊和团结像澜沧江和湄公河一样，奔流不息，万古长青！”
    出席招待会的有：柬中友协第一副主席苏南，第二副主席胡宁，秘书长蒲才和柬中友协的其他理事。出席宴会的还有：柬埔寨国民议会议长周桑科萨，王位最高委员会副主席康托尔亲王，柬中友协理事、国民议会第一副议长皮田列，（国民）教育国务秘书狄弟娜夫人和其他著名人士。
    中国驻柬埔寨大使陈叔亮和夫人，中国大使馆的外交官员以及参加第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会的中国体育代表团的一些成员也出席了宴会。
    代表团八日下午参观了人民社会同盟成就展览会。柬埔寨内阁第二副首相毛赛和王家美术大学校长旺·莫利旺给代表团作了讲解。张茜在参观之后向人民社会同盟展览会赠送了礼物并在留言簿上签了名。
