Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long Attend the Cambodian Ambassador's Reception

Peking, November 9 (New China News Agency) - Ambassador Zhang Kang of Cambodia held a reception tonight to celebrate the thirteenth anniversary of Cambodia's complete independence.

Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, Vice Premiers He Long and Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Cai Tingkai, President of the Supreme People's Court Yang Xiufeng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, were invited to attend the reception.

Prince Norodom Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who is in Beijing, also attended the reception.

Ambassador Zhang Kang and Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the reception.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech that Chairman Mao had pointed out long ago: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victories, and they give enthusiastic support and sympathy to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles." Vice Premier Chen Yi reiterated that in the struggle of the Cambodian people against the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the 700 million Chinese people will always stand on the side of the Cambodian people. Our position will not change. We are convinced that this fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia will be further consolidated and developed in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, expressed his gratitude to the Kingdom of Cambodia for its consistent sympathy and support for the just cause of the Chinese people, and for Prince Sihanouk's sympathetic attitude towards the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

At the beginning of the reception, Ambassador Zhang Kang spoke. He introduced Cambodia's achievements. He said that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys thought that without the "U.S. aid" that our country had already rejected three years ago, our country could not develop or make progress. However, our achievements were made precisely without "U.S. aid."

The ambassador introduced Cambodia's foreign policy of following a neutral path. He severely condemned the United States and the expansionists in Saigon and Bangkok for deliberately pursuing a policy of hostility towards Cambodia. The ambassador said that if they force our entire people to fight, then the Cambodian people will fight to the end, just like the Vietnamese people, regardless of the cost of the fight.

When talking about the friendly relations between the two peoples of Cambodia and China, the ambassador said that the People's Republic of China absolutely respects Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, neutrality policy, and territorial integrity. The two countries of Cambodia and China jointly observe the principles of mutual benefit and mutual respect. The relationship between the two countries is unbreakable. Our cooperation between the two countries is sincere, frank, and trustworthy. All of the above make China and Cambodia inseparable friends, although the two countries have different social systems.

The ambassador congratulated China on its achievements in all aspects. He especially enthusiastically said that we wish our great Chinese friends a complete victory in the cultural revolution launched by the Chinese youth, young pioneers, and Red Guards. He said that in order to cultivate capable assistants for the construction of the country, to build an iron wall of national defense forces, and to support the countries in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Cambodia, that are suffering from U.S. imperialist aggression, this cultural revolution is indispensable.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the Cambodian people for their spirit of self-reliance and hard work under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, especially after rejecting "U.S. aid," overcoming many difficulties and obstacles, and resisting U.S. imperialist economic pressure, and for insisting on the path of independent development.

He also praised the Cambodian people for their efforts to maintain their national dignity, peace, and neutrality, to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to continuously expose and smash various political conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese and Thai lackeys; and for resolutely countering the aggression and provocation of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. He said that the Cambodian people's heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is a great encouragement to all nations and peoples who are bullied and oppressed by U.S. imperialism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi stressed that the Kingdom of Cambodia has always sympathized with and supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and has made outstanding contributions to strengthening the anti-imperialist unity of the peoples of Indochina. He said that recently, U.S. imperialism, while intensifying the war of aggression against Vietnam, has also colluded with its followers to stage a big "peace talk" farce, attempting to achieve the plot of "forcing peace through war." In this situation, Prince Sihanouk, in response to Johnson's so-called Manila "Seven-Nation Summit," made a stern statement, pointing out that on the Vietnam issue, "there is no question of holding negotiations, nor is there any question of mediation, because the only thing necessary is for the United States to withdraw from Vietnam and respect the self-determination rights of the Vietnamese people, and these are things that do not require negotiations and mediation." The prince's statement shows the just position of the Cambodian people, powerfully exposes and strikes at the plots of U.S. imperialism and its followers, supports the Vietnamese people's just struggle, and is of great significance to the world's peoples in understanding the truth of the Vietnam issue and recognizing the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that at present, our country is carrying out a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution. This great revolution is personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong. Through this cultural revolution, the socialist construction of our country will be greatly accelerated, so that the Chinese people can more powerfully support and help the peoples of various countries who are suffering from U.S. imperialist aggression. Prince Sihanouk's sympathetic attitude towards our country's proletarian cultural revolution, as well as his enthusiastic congratulations and high evaluation of our country's successful launch of missiles and nuclear weapons, are powerful support for the Chinese people.

Those who were invited to attend the reception also included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong, leaders of other government departments, the People's Liberation Army, and other sectors.

Envoys from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

    中国文化大革命支持了遭受美帝侵略的各国人民
    周恩来总理贺龙副总理等出席了柬大使招待会
    新华社九日讯　柬埔寨驻中国大使张岗今晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝柬埔寨王国完全独立十三周年。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理贺龙、陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若、杨明轩，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民，国防委员会副主席蔡廷锴，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，应邀出席了招待会。
    在北京的诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王的儿子纳拉迪波王子，出席了招待会。
    张岗大使和陈毅副总理先后在招待会上讲话。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，毛主席早就指出：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”陈毅副总理重申，在柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其仆从的侵略和干涉的斗争中，七亿中国人民始终站在柬埔寨人民一边，我们的这个立场是不会改变的。我们深信，中柬两国人民的这种战斗友谊必将在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中不断巩固和发展。
    陈毅副总理代表中国政府和中国人民，感谢柬埔寨王国对中国人民的正义事业一贯给予同情和支持，感谢西哈努克亲王对中国无产阶级文化大革命的同情态度。
    张岗大使在招待会开始时讲话。他介绍了柬埔寨取得的成就。他说，美帝国主义和它的仆从，认为没有三年前我国已经拒绝了的“美援”，我国不可能有所发展，有所进步，但是，我们的成就正是在没有“美援”的情况下取得的。
    大使介绍了柬埔寨遵循中立道路的对外政策。他严厉谴责美国以及西贡和曼谷的扩张主义者蓄意推行敌视柬埔寨的政策。大使说，如果它们迫使我们全国人民起来战斗，那么柬埔寨人民将和越南人民一样抗战到底，而不问抗战的代价多高。
    在谈到柬中两国人民的友好关系时，大使说，中华人民共和国绝对尊重柬埔寨的独立主权、中立政策和领土完整。柬中两国共同遵守互惠互利、互相尊重的原则，两国之间的关系是牢不可破的。我们两国之间的合作是真诚、坦白和守信的。以上一切使中国和柬埔寨成为不可分离的朋友，虽然两国有着不同的社会制度。
    大使祝贺中国在各方面取得的成就。他特别热情地说，我们预祝伟大的中国朋友在中国青年、少先队员和红卫兵们展开的文化革命中取得彻底的胜利。他说，为了培养建设国家的得力助手，为了建立铜墙铁壁的国防力量，为了支持受美帝国主义侵略的包括越南和柬埔寨在内的东南亚地区的各国，这场文化大革命是不可少的。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中赞扬柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王的领导下，特别是在拒绝“美援”以后，以奋发图强、自力更生的精神，克服了许多困难和障碍，抵制了美帝国主义的经济压力，坚持了独立发展的道路。
    他还赞扬柬埔寨人民为维护自己的民族尊严、和平中立，捍卫国家主权和领土完整，不断地揭露和粉碎了美帝国主义及其南越、泰国仆从施展的各种政治阴谋；坚决回击了美帝国主义及其仆从的侵略和挑衅行动。他说，柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其仆从的英勇斗争，对一切受美帝国主义欺侮和压迫的民族和人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    陈毅副总理强调指出，柬埔寨王国一贯同情和支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，为加强印度支那人民的团结反帝事业作出了卓越的贡献。他说，最近，美帝国主义一面加紧扩大侵略越南的战争，另一方面伙同它的追随者大搞“和谈”骗局，企图实现“以战迫和”的阴谋。在这种情况下，西哈努克亲王针对约翰逊策动的所谓马尼拉“七国首脑会议”，发表了义正词严的谈话，指出在越南问题上，“谈不上举行谈判，也谈不上进行调停，因为唯一必需的是美国从越南撤走，并尊重越南人的自决权利，而这些都是无需举行谈判和进行调停的”。亲王的讲话表明了柬埔寨人民的公正立场，有力地揭露和打击了美帝国主义及其追随者的阴谋，支持了越南人民的正义斗争，对于世界人民了解越南问题的真相，认清美帝国主义的侵略面目，具有重要的意义。
    陈毅副总理说，目前，我国正在进行轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命。这场大革命，是毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的。通过这次文化大革命，将大大地加速我国的社会主义建设，从而使中国人民能够更加有力地支持和帮助正在遭受美帝国主义侵略的各国人民。西哈努克亲王对我国无产阶级文化大革命的同情态度，以及对我国成功地发射导弹核武器给予的热烈祝贺和高度评价，都是对中国人民的有力支持。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有外交部副部长韩念龙，政府其他各部门、中国人民解放军的负责人，以及其他各方面的人士。
    各国驻中国的使节也应邀出席了招待会。
