The Chinese Red Cross Society today issued a statement protesting the U.S. and Soviet manipulation of the Red Cross Society in playing the "peace talks" deception in Vietnam. This statement has been sent to the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Lion and Sun societies of various countries.

The statement said that the 86th Executive Committee of the Red Cross Society, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, disregarded the repeated warnings of the Chinese Red Cross Society delegation before and during the opening ceremony, and forced the "representatives" of the South Vietnamese puppet regime's Red Cross into the meeting as observers. This was done to cater to the needs of the U.S. imperialists and their chief accomplice, the Soviet revisionist leadership, in playing the "peace talks" deception in Vietnam. After the Chinese delegation issued a statement and withdrew from the meeting, the conference passed a resolution on "Red Cross and Peace" to serve the plot of "peace talks" in Vietnam and distributed this illegal resolution to various governments. What is even more intolerable is that they also sent this so-called resolution to the Kuomintang clique, which has already been overthrown by the Chinese people. The Chinese Red Cross Society expresses great indignation and strong protest against this.

The statement said that the dirty dealings at the 86th Executive Committee of the Red Cross Society further exposed the weakness of U.S. imperialism and the ugly face of Soviet revisionism, and also showed that the actions of the 86th Executive Committee of the Red Cross Society were purely to exonerate the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism.

The statement also condemned the Red Cross Society for once again blatantly creating the "Two Chinas" in its conference news bulletin and openly opposing the Chinese people. The statement pointed out that anyone who opposes the 700 million Chinese people will not have a good ending.

The statement said that at the 86th Executive Committee of the Red Cross Society, the representatives of the Soviet revisionist leadership's Red Cross not only openly sat with the "representatives" of the South Vietnamese puppet regime's Red Cross to hold a meeting, but also directly played the role of the vanguard in slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on behalf of U.S. imperialism. They proposed the so-called "Red Cross and Peace" motion to serve the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam. This once again exposed that their so-called "united action" is actually a united action with U.S. imperialism, opposing China, opposing the Vietnamese people, and betraying and strangling the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is doomed to fail. A resolution from the Red Cross Society cannot save it. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic."

The statement said that the Chinese Red Cross Society, together with the Chinese people, firmly supports the just struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people.

The statement finally solemnly declared that the Chinese Red Cross Society, in view of the Red Cross Society's willingness to serve the war policies of U.S. imperialism and turn the international conference of the Red Cross into a place for U.S.-Soviet collusion to conduct political transactions, will have to reconsider its relationship with the Red Cross Society.

    我红十字会声明谴责红十字会协会制造“两个中国”阴谋
    抗议美苏操纵红十字会协会玩弄和谈骗局
    鉴于该协会为美帝效劳，我将重新考虑和它的关系
    据新华社三十一日讯  中国红十字会今天发表声明，抗议美苏操纵红十字会协会玩弄越南“和谈”骗局。这个声明已发给各国红十字会、红新月会、红狮和太阳会。
    声明说，红十字会协会第八十六次执委会，在美帝国主义操纵下，不顾中国红十字会代表团在会前及开幕式上的一再警告，把南越傀儡政权红十字会“代表”以观察员身份塞进了会议，以迎合美帝国主义及其头号帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团在会议上玩弄越南“和谈”骗局的需要，在中国代表团发表声明退席之后，会议通过了为越南“和谈”阴谋效劳的所谓“红十字与和平”的决议，并把这项非法的决议分发给各国政府。更不能令人容忍的是，它们还把这个所谓的决议发给早已为中国人民推翻的蒋介石集团。对此，中国红十字会表示极大的愤慨和强烈的抗议。
    声明说，红十字会协会第八十六次执委会上这种肮脏勾当，进一步暴露了美帝国主义的虚弱与苏联修正主义的丑恶嘴脸，也说明红十字会协会第八十六次执委会的所作所为是不折不扣地为美帝国主义的侵略政策开脱。
    声明还谴责红十字会协会在它的会议新闻公报中又一次明目张胆的制造“两个中国”，公开与中国人民为敌。声明指出，任何与七亿中国人民为敌的人都不会有好下场。
    声明说，在红十字会协会第八十六次执委会会议上，苏联修正主义领导集团红十字会的代表，不仅公然同南越傀儡政权的红十字会“代表”坐在一起开会，而且直接扮演了美帝国主义诬蔑越南民主共和国及越南南方民族解放阵线的急先锋，提出为美帝国主义侵略越南效劳的所谓“红十字与和平”的提案。这就再一次暴露了他们大肆鼓吹的所谓“联合行动”，实际上是联合美帝国主义，反对中国，反对越南人民，出卖和扼杀越南人民的抗美救国斗争。声明指出，美帝国主义对越南的侵略是注定要失败的。红十字会协会的一纸决议，是救不了它的命的。中国人民的伟大的领袖毛泽东主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    声明说，中国红十字会和中国人民一道，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民的正义斗争。
    声明最后郑重表示，中国红十字会鉴于红十字会协会甘心为美帝国主义推行战争政策效劳，把红十字会国际会议变为美苏勾结进行政治交易的场所，中国红十字会将不得不重新考虑它和红十字会协会的关系。
