	Most Brazenly Serving U.S. Imperialism's Anti-China Policy
	Canadian Foreign Minister Publicly Advocates "Two Chinas" Scheme

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated November 24: New York: Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, Canadian Foreign Minister Martin, on November 23, during the United Nations General Assembly debate on the so-called "Chinese representation issue," proposed a "three-point plan" that openly advocates for "two Chinas." This further exposed the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to intensify the creation of "two Chinas."

	The UN General Assembly's debate on this issue began on November 18. On November 21, Italy and five other countries, acting on behalf of the United States, had already proposed a draft resolution that, while appearing more covert, essentially aimed to create "two Chinas." This draft resolution advocated for the establishment of a "committee" to "study" the so-called "Chinese representation issue." Despite the fact that this new trick by U.S. imperialism was immediately exposed and criticized by Albania and many Asian and African countries, it remained undeterred and even more brazenly pushed forward with this dirty conspiracy.

	In his speech on November 23, Martin expressed support for the draft resolution proposed by Italy and other countries. He even found that the anti-China draft resolution "did not go far enough." He openly advocated for using a barefaced "two Chinas" theory as the "basis" for solving the so-called "Chinese representation issue." His "three-point plan" absurdly proposed that the legitimate representatives of the Chinese people and the "representatives" of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique should both participate in the General Assembly as "member states" representing "the territory they effectively control," while the legitimate representatives of the Chinese people should "participate in the Security Council as a permanent member."

	This is a serious provocation against the great Chinese people and is, to date, the most brazen plan openly serving U.S. imperialism's anti-China policy proposed at the United Nations. However, the Canadian representative tasked with this highly discreditable mission insisted that this plan "in no way implies the existence of two Chinas."

	According to a report by the American News Agency, Martin, before proposing this "plan," had secret consultations with the U.S. government. He had also "visited Moscow and Rome for consultations and sought support for his plan through diplomatic contacts in Washington, Tokyo, and other places."

### 最露骨地为美帝反华政策效劳  加外长公开鼓吹“两个中国”的方案

    最露骨地为美帝反华政策效劳
    加外长公开鼓吹“两个中国”的方案
    据新华社二十四日讯  纽约消息：在美帝国主义的指使下，加拿大外交部长马丁二十三日在联合国大会辩论所谓中国代表权问题时，抛出了一个公开鼓吹“两个中国”的所谓“三点计划”，它进一步暴露了美帝国主义阴谋加紧制造“两个中国”的罪恶企图。
    联大关于这个问题的辩论是从十八日开始的；二十一日，意大利等六国秉承美国的意旨，已经提出过一个形式上较为隐蔽、而实质上也是制造“两个中国”的提案，鼓吹成立一个“委员会”来“研究”所谓“中国代表权问题”。尽管美帝国主义的这一新花招一开始就遭到了阿尔巴尼亚和许多亚非国家的揭露和抨击，但是，它贼心不死，更加变本加厉地推行这个肮脏的阴谋。
    马丁在二十三日的发言中，表示支持意大利等国的提案，而且还嫌那个敌视中国的提案“走得还不够远”。他公然鼓吹以一个赤裸裸的“两个中国”的理论作为解决所谓“中国代表权问题”的“基础”。他就此提出的一个“三点计划”，荒谬地主张中国人民的合法代表同蒋介石卖国集团的“代表”都作为“代表一块它有效地管辖的土地”的“成员国”“参加大会”，而由中国人民的合法代表“作为常任国参加安全理事会”。
    这是对伟大的中国人民的严重挑衅，是迄今为止，在联合国公开提出的一个最露骨地为美帝国主义反华政策效劳的计划。然而，担负这一极不光彩任务的这个加拿大代表，却硬说这个计划“决无暗示存在两个中国的意思”。
    据美国通讯社透露，马丁在提出这个“计划”之前，同美国政府进行过密商，他还“曾经到莫斯科、罗马去进行过磋商，并且通过在华盛顿、东京及其他地方的外交接触为他的计划争取支持。”
