Hundreds of thousands of revolutionary students and Red Guards have traversed mountains and rivers to come to the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing, to be by the side of our great leader Chairman Mao. The revolutionary people of the capital have welcomed the revolutionary youngsters with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, providing them with meticulous care in every aspect, from political ideology to daily life. They regard the task of receiving Chairman Mao's guests as a glorious political mission and the most fervent support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At the reception stations, in schools, on buses and trams, in shops, everywhere is filled with the warmth of the socialist big family, everywhere is the concern of comrades. Revolutionary students praise the reception comrades as "good servants sent by Chairman Mao."

Here, we introduce a few episodes from the reception work.

Chairman Mao's Guests Arrive at Our Village

The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants of Nangao Production Brigade in the Joyous Days of Welcoming Revolutionary Cadres

"Chairman Mao's guests are coming to our village!"

At noon on October 31, this joyous news spread like wildfire through the Nangao Production Brigade of the China-Albania Friendship People's Commune. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants bustled about like they were preparing to welcome a dear relative: female commune members were busy cleaning the rooms, male commune members were busy moving straw mats, old women took out the cleanest bedding, young men prepared drums and gongs for the welcome... Every family was joyous, and everyone's face was lit up with smiles.

This lively scene reminded people of the early winter of 1948. At that time, the soldiers who liberated Beijing came to the Nangao Production Brigade. The villagers had stayed up all night pushing rice, grinding flour, boiling water, carrying straw mats, and carrying horse feed. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants poured their love for the Party and Chairman Mao into the People's Liberation Army, the army of Chairman Mao.

Today, Chairman Mao's loyal little red soldiers, the reliable reserve force of the People's Liberation Army—the Red Guards—are coming here. How could the commune members not be happy? Many commune members said well: These revolutionary youngsters have crossed thousands of mountains and traversed ten thousand rivers from the five lakes and four seas to the capital of our motherland. Why? It is to ensure that the country won by the revolutionary forerunners will never change color, to ensure that we poor and lower-middle peasants will forever be the masters! We were born in Beijing, living by the side of Chairman Mao, we should, like welcoming our own soldiers, warmly welcome the Red Guards from other places who have come to Beijing!

"Red Guards have arrived!"

At eleven o'clock at night, car after car, batch after batch of Red Guards arrived at the China-Albania Friendship People's Commune. Joyous songs, enthusiastic slogans, and warm greetings blended into a symphony of friendship.

The Nangao Production Team instantly became lively. Commune member Zhao Bozhen enthusiastically invited six revolutionary youngsters from Shanghai to his home. He thought: Our own children have also gone out to make connections. We are all class brothers and should care for, love, and help each other. These are guests invited by Chairman Mao, and we must not let them catch a cold. He arranged for the six youngsters to sleep on the heated kang, while he and his two granddaughters slept on a makeshift bed on the floor.

The chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association, Cui Wenzhi's wife, had been waiting from noon until after two in the morning before two young female Red Guards arrived. The old woman welcomed them like seeing her long-lost daughter, pouring tea, offering water, asking about their health, and being very affectionate. She pulled a Red Guard from Shanghai to her side, examined her, and found that she was dressed lightly. With concern, she asked, "Child, it's almost winter, why didn't you wear a cotton coat?" Saying this, she took out a new cotton coat from the wardrobe and draped it over her. A warm current immediately warmed the Red Guard's entire body.

So many Red Guards received such warmth here. They thanked the commune members with tears in their eyes. The commune members said: Don't thank us, thank Chairman Mao instead!

People's Liberation Army Academy emphasizes politics in reception work and enthusiastically propagates Mao Zedong Thought. This is a scene where the reception team visits the dormitory of Red Guards and revolutionary students from a work-study school in Nanjing, studying Chairman Mao's quotations together.

Just after the revolutionary teachers and students from other places had settled down, the officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison came to perform a comfort show.

    成千上万的革命师生和红卫兵，越过万水千山，来到无产阶级文化大革命的中心北京，来到我们伟大领袖毛主席的身边。首都革命人民，以最大的革命热情欢迎革命小将们，从政治思想以至生活等方面给以无微不至的关怀。他们把接待好毛主席请来的客人，作为一项光荣的政治任务，作为对无产阶级文化大革命最热烈的支持。
    在接待站，在学校里，在公共汽车和电车上，在商店里，到处洋溢着社会主义大家庭的温暖，到处是同志式的关怀。革命师生赞扬接待同志是“毛主席派来的好服务员”。
    这里，我们介绍的是接待工作中的几个片断。

    毛主席的客人到咱村
    ——南皋大队贫下中农在接待革命小将的欢乐日子里
    “毛主席的客人要到咱们村来了！”
    十月三十一日中午，这个喜讯像长了翅膀，飞快地传遍了中阿友好人民公社南皋大队。广大贫下中农，像准备迎接亲人似地忙碌开了：女社员忙着打扫房子，男社员忙着搬运铺草，老大娘把最干净的铺盖拿出来，小伙子们准备了欢迎的锣鼓……。家家欢欢喜喜，人人笑容满面。
    这热闹的场面，使人们想起了一九四八年初冬。那时候，解放北京城的子弟兵来到了南皋大队。老乡们曾经整宿整宿地忙着推米，磨面，烧开水，抬铺草，背马料。广大贫下中农对党和毛主席的热爱，都倾注在毛主席的军队——人民解放军身上。
    今天，毛主席的忠实的红小兵、解放军可靠的后备部队——红卫兵战士，就要到这里来了，社员们怎能不高兴呢？许多社员说得好：这些革命小将，跨千山，涉万水，从五湖四海来到祖国的首都，是为了什么呢？就是为了使革命前辈打下的江山永不变色，使我们贫下中农世世代代永作主人！我们生在北京，住在毛主席身边的贫下中农，应该像当年迎接我们的子弟兵一样，热烈欢迎外地来京的红卫兵！
      “红卫兵来了！”
    深夜十一点钟，一车车，一队队的红卫兵来到了中阿友好人民公社。欢乐的歌声，热烈的口号，亲切的问候，汇成了一支友谊的交响曲。
    南皋生产队，顷刻之间欢腾起来了。社员赵伯珍热情地把来自上海的六个革命小将请到自己家里。他想：我们自己的孩子也出外串连了。大家都是阶级兄弟，应该互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。这是毛主席请来的客人，千万不能让他们着凉。他把这六位小将安排在热炕上，自己和两个外孙女另外搭了个地铺。
    贫协主任崔文志的老伴，从中午一直等到深夜两点多，才等来了两个年轻的女红卫兵。老大娘像见到了久别的亲闺女一样，又是倒茶，又是送水，问寒问暖，亲亲热热。她把一个上海来的红卫兵拉到自己身边，端详了一番，发现她衣衫单薄，心疼地问道：“孩子，快十冬腊月了，你怎么没穿棉衣来？”说着，便从衣柜里，把自己闺女的一件新棉大衣拿出来，披在她身上。一股暖流，立刻温暖了这个红卫兵的全身。
    多少个红卫兵，都在这里得到了这样的温暖。他们含着眼泪，向社员们致谢。社员们说：不要谢我们，还是感谢毛主席他老人家吧！
