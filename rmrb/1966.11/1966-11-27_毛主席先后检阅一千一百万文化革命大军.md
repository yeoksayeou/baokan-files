In the unprecedented and great revolutionary movement of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has shaken the entire nation and the world, and in the midst of the excellent situation where hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are advancing along Chairman Mao's correct line, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, on November 25 and 26, received in the capital over 2.5 million revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country.

This was the eighth time Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, received the revolutionary youth. It was also the last reception before next spring, summarizing the victories of the revolutionary link-ups and studies of students over the past three months. This reception will promote the revolutionary link-ups of students nationwide.

In the past three months since August 18, including National Day, Chairman Mao has received over 11 million revolutionary students and Red Guards. In such a short period, our great leader, Chairman Mao, has met with so many revolutionary masses, which is an unprecedented great revolutionary feat in the history of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement.

At the eighth reception held on November 25 and 26, the 2.5 million revolutionary youth, with boundless happiness and excitement, said, "Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts! Only you, the great Marxist-Leninist, only you, the great genius, have the courage and determination to launch this great revolutionary mass movement that has shaken the world. You are the greatest revolutionary of the proletariat in the world. You love the masses the most, believe in the masses the most, and support the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses the most. Your heart is closely connected with the hearts of the revolutionary masses. You have set the most brilliant example for all Marxist-Leninists in the world and for our younger generation."

The revolutionary youth said, Chairman Mao's continuous eight receptions of us, revolutionary students, and Red Guards, is the greatest encouragement and support for the revolutionary youth and broad revolutionary masses nationwide, especially the main force of the Cultural Revolution—the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao's repeated receptions have driven the Proletarian Cultural Revolution to surge forward, achieving one victory after another. They expressed their determination not to disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations, to quickly take his care and instructions back, to summarize the experiences of revolutionary link-ups and studies, to learn better from the People's Liberation Army and the worker-peasant masses, to study Chairman Mao's works more deeply, to work hard on the "word" aspect, to change their worldview with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," to firmly defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and to carry out the Cultural Revolution in their regions and units deeply and thoroughly, making it better.

On November 25, although the temperature dropped to around zero degrees Celsius, the news of Chairman Mao receiving the revolutionary youth warmed everyone's heart. Over 600,000 revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country gathered in the capital, taking the PLA as an example, emphasizing politics, and following Chairman Mao's personally formulated Three Main Styles and Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention as their guidelines. They formed Red Guard brigades, regiments, and divisions by class, platoon, and company, each holding a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing revolutionary songs, and facing the biting cold wind before dawn, they gathered from all directions to Tiananmen Square and the east side of the square, forming a vast red tide. When the sun rose from the eastern horizon, the revolutionary youth, full of vigor, read Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again, turning the entire Tiananmen Square into a magnificent and grand classroom of Mao Zedong Thought.

At 11:30 AM, the music "The East Is Red" played, and the hearts of millions of people surged, with millions of eyes looking up at Tiananmen.

"Chairman Mao is here! Chairman Mao is here!"

Amidst the roaring cheers, Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao stepped onto Tiananmen Gate. Central and other leaders such as Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Deng Xiaoping, Kang Sheng, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Song Qingling, Chen Yi, He Long, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xu Xiangqian, Ye Jianying, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Xiao Hua, Jiang Qing, and Wu De also ascended Tiananmen Gate.

In an instant, the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!" echoed like rolling thunder, shaking the heavens and the earth.

Member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and advisor to the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Comrade Kang Sheng, announced the beginning of the meeting. He, on behalf of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, extended proletarian cultural revolutionary combat greetings to the revolutionary youth. Comrade Kang Sheng said to everyone: Chairman Mao receiving us is the greatest encouragement and our greatest honor!

Following that, the grand parade began with the music "The Boat Needs a Helmsman."

The revolutionary youth lined up on the east side of Tiananmen Square, with the powerful posture of the reserve army of the PLA, holding high red flags and portraits of Chairman Mao, marching with vigorous steps, waving the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and passing through Tiananmen Square with high spirits, accepting the inspection of the highest commander of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao.

On that day, Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao stayed with the revolutionary students and Red Guards in the biting cold wind for four hours. As each team of revolutionary youth passed through the square, they shouted enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao, with a benevolent smile, repeatedly waved and greeted them.

After the parade, the cultural revolutionary army gathered in front of Tiananmen, jumping and cheering for Chairman Mao's longevity. Chairman Mao walked to the east and west ends of Tiananmen Gate, repeatedly waving his hat to the cheering crowd. At this moment, the entire observation platform and the crowd below were in a state of great joy, with the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" resonating through the sky.

On November 26, our most respected great leader, Chairman Mao, continued to receive and inspect the cultural revolutionary army.

On that day, over 180,000 revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country lined up on Tiananmen Square and the wide roads on both sides of the square, as well as at Xijiao Airport, forming a vast red river.

At 2:30 PM, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, along with central and other leaders, arrived among the revolutionary youth in open-top cars to the music of "The East Is Red."

Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, radiant and towering, stood on the first open-top car, repeatedly waving warmly to the crowd lining the streets.

Wherever Chairman Mao's car went, there was a surge of joy. Countless people had tears of excitement, and countless people waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." A million red hearts burst forth with the same resounding slogan: "Long live Chairman Mao!" The revolutionary youth, with boundless affection, watched Chairman Mao's car drive past. At this moment, the red road was filled with songs, and people were immersed in boundless joy and infinite happiness.

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you on the revolutionary Long March!" At the reception held on November 25 and 26, over 500 teams of Red Guards who had marched from Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Liaoning, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Jilin, and Jiangxi provinces to Beijing saw their long-awaited great leader, Chairman Mao. A team of 39 Red Guards from Zhaoyuan County, Shandong Province, saw Chairman Mao and were extremely excited, wanting to present a shoulder pole that had accompanied them on their 1,700-mile march to the great leader. The pole had the words "Successors dare to bear heavy burdens" written on it. The youth said that the pole represented their determination not to disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations, to care about state affairs, and to bravely shoulder the burden of revolution, carrying the Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Nine male and female marchers from the Zhengzhou School of Health, carrying the banner of the "White Seekers Long March Team," marched in the middle of the queue. During their march, they specially went to the tomb of White Seekers in Shijiazhuang City to review Chairman Mao's article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," expressing their determination to learn from the internationalist spirit of White Seekers, who were extremely responsible for their work and extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people. They also went to Qixian County, Henan Province, where Chairman Mao had inspected, to labor and study Chairman Mao's works with the commune members.

"Chinese sons and daughters have great aspirations, loving red clothes but preferring military uniforms." Some teams of female Red Guards were particularly eye-catching. More than ten female warriors from a "Red Long March Team" in Inner Mongolia swore before their departure: "We want to be seagulls in the storm, not flowers in the greenhouse." With a fearless and unyielding spirit, they set out on their journey and came to Chairman Mao's side. When Chairman Mao waved to them, the youth shed tears of happiness. They expressed their determination to march back on foot, bringing Chairman Mao's warm care to the revolutionary people of the grasslands and carrying the Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

In the ranks of the Red Guards being inspected, revolutionary youth from Feidong County, Anhui Province, the hometown of the communist warrior Cai Yongxiang, reported to Chairman Mao the new achievements of the entire county in learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, taking Cai Yongxiang as an example. They saw Chairman Mao and said excitedly, "Cai Yongxiang could become a selfless communist warrior because of the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. All the people of our county are determined to be like Cai Yongxiang, to study and apply the 'Three Constantly Read Articles,' and to consciously establish a selfless communist worldview." The children of revolutionary martyrs from Jinggangshan, Yan Hong, and a Red Guard from Hangzhou No. 8 Middle School, before coming to Beijing, specially went to the Qianjiang Bridge to listen to Cai Yongxiang's comrades-in-arms introduce Cai Yongxiang's moving stories of studying and applying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" to transform his soul. They said they would definitely become a selfless Red Guard of Chairman Mao like Cai Yongxiang.

Part of the revolutionary students from military academaffiliated with the People's Liberation Army brought their victories in establishing Mao Zedong Thought in the Cultural Revolution to report to Chairman Mao. They resolutely responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, taking the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, learning from Cai Yongxiang, speeding up their ideological transformation, and firmly planting Mao Zedong Thought in their minds.

Eighteen students from Yonghong Middle School in Fengfeng Mining Area, Hebei Province, crossed the Taihang Mountains twice to learn from Dazhai. The students saw the heroic spirit of the Dazhai people in changing the heavens and the earth and their ideological struggle to break down "self" and establish "public," receiving great education and inspiration. The students said that seeing Chairman Mao gave them strength, and they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the worker-peasant masses, temper and transform themselves, and achieve ideological revolutionization. Wang Yueqing, the son of the Iron Man of Daqing, Wang Jinxi, a junior high school student, saw the long-awaited Chairman Mao and excitedly said, "I saw Chairman Mao! I saw Chairman Mao!" This 15-year-old Little Red Guard had long memorized "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and practiced it wherever he went. Wang Yueqing said: I will listen to Chairman Mao's words like my father, do revolution for life, and be a lifelong old yellow cow for the people.

Before the end of the meeting on November 25, Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao happily went among the foreign guests and had a cordial meeting with them. The foreign friends gathered around Chairman Mao, took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and asked Chairman Mao to sign. They excitedly shouted over and over again: "Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

    毛主席先后检阅一千一百万文化革命大军
    毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，第八次接见二百五十万革命小将。这是明年春暖以前的最后一次接见，是三个多月来革命师生进行革命串连的胜利总结
    革命小将们激动地说，毛主席啊，我们心中的红太阳，只有您才有这样巨大的魄力和决心，发动这场震撼世界的伟大革命群众运动。您为全世界的马列主义者，为我们青年一代，树立了最光辉的榜样
    新华社二十六日讯　在震撼全国和全世界的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，在全国亿万革命群众沿着毛主席的正确路线胜利前进的大好形势下，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，十一月二十五日和二十六日，在首都接见了来自全国各地的二百五十万革命师生和红卫兵。
    这是毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志对革命小将的第八次接见，也是明年春暖以前的最后一次接见。这次接见，显示了伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，是三个多月来革命师生进行串连和学习的一次胜利的总结，它将促进全国革命师生实行全程步行革命大串连。
    从八月十八日以来的三个多月中，连同国庆节在内，毛主席已经接见了一千一百多万革命师生和红卫兵。在这样短的时间内，我们的伟大领袖毛主席同这样众多的革命群众见面，这在中国革命历史上，在国际共产主义运动的历史上是前所未有的伟大的革命创举。
    在二十五日和二十六日连续两天举行的第八次接见大会上，二百五十万革命小将怀着无比幸福、无比激动的心情说，毛主席啊，我们心中的红太阳！只有您这样伟大的马克思列宁主义者，只有您这样伟大的天才，才有这样巨大的魄力和决心，发动这场震撼世界的伟大的革命群众运动。您是世界上最伟大的无产阶级革命家，您最最热爱群众，最最相信群众，最最支持群众的革命首创精神，您的心和革命群众的心紧紧相连，您为全世界的马克思列宁主义者，为我们青年一代，树立了最光辉的榜样。
    革命小将们说，毛主席连续八次接见我们革命师生和红卫兵，是对全国革命青少年和广大革命群众，特别是文化大革命主力军——工农兵群众的最大鼓舞、最大支持。毛主席一次又一次的接见，推动着无产阶级文化大革命汹涌澎湃地向前发展，取得一个又一个巨大的胜利。他们表示，决不辜负毛主席的殷切期望，一定要把毛主席的关怀和指示迅速带回去，很好地总结革命串连和学习的经验，更好地向人民解放军学习，向工农群众学习，更加深入地活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神改造世界观，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把本地区本单位的文化大革命搞深搞透，搞得更好。
    二十五日这天，虽然气温降到摄氏零度左右，但毛主席接见革命小将的喜讯，温暖着每个人的心。从五湖四海云集首都的六十多万革命师生和红卫兵，以解放军为榜样，突出政治，把毛主席亲手制定的三八作风和三大纪律八项注意作为行动的指南，他们按照班、排、连组成红卫兵师、团，人人手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱革命歌曲，迎着黎明前刺骨的寒风，从四面八方汇集到天安门广场和广场东侧的条条大道上，结成一支支波澜壮阔的红色巨流。当太阳从东方地平线上升起的时候，英姿焕发的革命小将们一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席语录，整个天安门广场成了一所雄伟壮丽的毛泽东思想大课堂。
    十一点三十分，《东方红》乐曲奏响了，千万人心潮澎湃，千万双眼睛仰望着天安门。
      “毛主席来啦！毛主席来啦！”
    毛主席和林彪同志，在海啸般的欢呼声中，健步登上天安门城楼。中央和其他方面的领导同志周恩来、陶铸、陈伯达、邓小平、康生、刘少奇、朱德、李富春、宋庆龄、陈毅、贺龙、李先念、谭震林、徐向前、叶剑英、谢富治、刘宁一、萧华、江青、吴德等登上了天安门城楼。
    顷刻间，“毛主席万岁”、“毛主席万万岁”的欢呼声，像滚滚春雷，震天动地。
    中共中央政治局常委、中央文化革命小组顾问康生同志宣布大会开始。他代表毛主席、党中央和中央文化革命小组，向革命小将们致无产阶级文化大革命的战斗的敬礼。康生同志对大家说：毛主席接见我们，这是对我们最大的鼓舞，是我们的最大光荣！
    接着，盛大的游行在《大海航行靠舵手》的乐曲声中开始。
    排列在天安门广场东侧大道上的革命小将，以解放军强大后备军的战斗姿态，高举红旗和毛主席画像，迈着矫健的步伐，挥舞着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，意气风发地通过天安门广场，接受无产阶级文化大革命的最高统帅毛主席的检阅。
    这一天，毛主席和林彪同志，在凛冽的寒风中一直和革命师生和红卫兵在一起，持续达四小时。一队队革命小将在通过广场时，尽情地欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席含着慈祥的微笑，不断地向大家招手致意。
    游行结束以后，聚集在广场上的文化革命大军涌向天安门前，狂欢跳跃，祝毛主席万寿无疆。毛主席走向天安门城楼东西两端，向欢呼的人群频频挥帽致意。这时，观礼台上下，万众欢腾，“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声，响彻云霄。
    二十六日，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，继续接见并检阅了文化革命大军。
    这一天，来自全国各地的一百八十多万革命师生和红卫兵小将，排列在天安门广场和广场西侧的宽广大道两旁，以及西郊机场上，整个队伍像奔腾浩荡的红色长江。
    下午两点三十分，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央和其他方面领导同志，在《东方红》乐曲声中，分乘敞篷汽车，来到了革命小将中间。
    毛主席身穿军装，容光焕发，巍然屹立在第一辆敞篷汽车上，向夹道欢呼的人群不断地亲切招手。
    毛主席乘着汽车走到哪里，哪里就一片欢腾。多少人含着激动的泪花，多少人挥舞着《毛主席语录》，百万颗红心里迸发出同一个嘹亮的口号：“毛主席万岁！”革命小将们怀着无限深情，目送毛主席乘车驰过去。这时，红色大道上歌声四起，人们一直沉浸在无比欢腾、无限幸福中。
      “毛主席呀毛主席，我们永远跟着您在革命的长征路上勇往直前！”在二十五日和二十六日连续两天举行的接见大会上，从河北、山西、内蒙古、山东、辽宁、河南、安徽、湖北、湖南、陕西、江苏、吉林、江西等省区徒步来到北京的五百多支红卫兵长征队的小将们，见到了日夜思念的伟大领袖毛主席。来自山东省招远县的一支长征队的三十九名小将见到了毛主席，万分激动，要把伴随他们步行长征了一千七百多里路的一条扁担献给伟大领袖。扁担上写着：“接班人敢挑重担”几个大字。小将们说，这扁担，表示了我们绝不辜负毛主席的殷切期望，关心国家大事，勇敢地挑起革命的重担子，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。来自郑州卫生学校的九名男女长征队队员，扛着“白求恩长征队”的大旗走在队伍中间。他们在长征途中，特意到石家庄市的白求恩墓前，重温毛主席写的《纪念白求恩》的文章，表示要坚决学习国际主义战士白求恩同志对工作极端负责任，对同志对人民极端热忱的共产主义精神。他们还到毛主席曾经视察过的河南省新乡县七里营公社去劳动，和社员一起学习毛主席著作。
      “中华儿女多奇志，不爱红装爱武装。”一些由女红卫兵小将组成的长征队，特别引人注目。内蒙古的一支“红色长征队”的十多个女战士，出发前宣誓说：我们要做暴风雨中的海燕，不做温室里的花朵。她们以天不怕、地不怕的豪迈气概，踏上征途，来到了毛主席的身边。当毛主席向她们招手致意的时候，小将们流下了幸福的热泪。她们表示，一定再步行回去，把毛主席的亲切关怀带给草原上的革命人民，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在接受检阅的红卫兵行列中，来自共产主义战士蔡永祥的家乡安徽省肥东县的革命小将们，带着肥东县人民以蔡永祥为榜样，轰轰烈烈地开展活学活用毛主席著作的新成绩向毛主席汇报。他们见到了毛主席，激动地说，“蔡永祥能够成为一心为公的共产主义战士，是毛泽东思想哺育的结果，我们全县人民都决心像蔡永祥那样，活学活用‘老三篇’，自觉地建立一心为公的共产主义世界观。”井冈山的革命烈士子弟岩红和杭州市第八中学的一个红卫兵，来京前曾经特地前往钱塘江大桥，在蔡永祥英勇献身的地方，去听蔡永祥生前的战友介绍蔡永祥活学活用“老三篇”改造自己灵魂的动人事迹。他们说，我们一定要做一个蔡永祥式的一心为公的毛主席的红小兵。
    中国人民解放军所属军事院校的部分革命师生带着他们在文化革命中大立毛泽东思想的胜利成果，来向毛主席汇报。他们坚决响应林彪同志的把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段的号召，将“老三篇”作为座右铭，以蔡永祥为榜样，加速思想改造，让毛泽东思想在头脑中牢固扎下根子。
    来自河北峰峰矿区永红中学的十八名小将，两次翻越太行山，到大寨去学习。小将们看到了大寨人改天换地的英雄气概，看到了大寨人破“私”立“公”的思想斗争，受到了很大教育和鼓舞。小将们说，见到了毛主席，我们浑身增添了力量，我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，到工农群众中去，锻炼自己，改造自己，实现思想革命化。大庆铁人王进喜的儿子、初中学生王月亭，见到了日夜想念的毛主席，激动得连声说：“我见到了毛主席啦，见到毛主席啦！”这个只有十五岁的红小兵，早就背熟了《为人民服务》，走到哪里就用到哪里。王月亭说：我要像爸爸那样，坚决听毛主席的话，干一辈子革命，做一辈子人民的老黄牛。
    毛主席和林彪同志在二十五日大会结束前，高兴地来到各国来宾中间，同他们亲切会见。各国朋友们聚在毛主席周围，拿出《毛主席语录》，请毛主席签字。他们激动地一再高呼：“毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
