Comrade Lin Biao has called on us to make every effort to truly learn and master Mao Zedong Thought.

To truly master Mao Zedong Thought is a requirement of the times, a requirement of the revolution, and a fundamental condition for becoming a conscious revolutionary fighter of the proletariat. Without mastering Mao Zedong Thought, one cannot distinguish right from wrong, friend from foe, or good from bad; one is a confused person. Without mastering Mao Zedong Thought, even if one has a sincere heart for Chairman Mao and the people, one cannot truly do a good job and is bound to make mistakes of one kind or another. The more Mao Zedong Thought one learns and the better one uses it, the more steadfast one's proletarian stand will be, the higher one's ideological and political level will be, and the more skilled one will be in revolution. Striving to master Mao Zedong Thought is our lifelong combat mission.

At present, the vast majority of our comrades are not faced with the question of whether to learn Mao Zedong Thought or not, but with the question of whether they have truly learned it and whether they can truly use it. To truly master Mao Zedong Thought means to truly understand it and to be proficient in applying it. To truly master Mao Zedong Thought means to consciously and unconditionally do as Chairman Mao says. This is the direction and goal of struggle that the new stage of the campaign to study Chairman Mao's works has set for us.

Chairman Mao said: "Learning is not an easy thing, and using it is even more difficult." "To say that learning and using it are not easy is to say that it is not easy to learn it thoroughly and to use it proficiently." Mao Zedong Thought is the science of proletarian revolution, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in our time. To truly understand it and to be proficient in applying it, one must make every effort to study it seriously and diligently. One must combine it with practice, focus on key points, study it repeatedly, and use it repeatedly, concentrating on the application.

The principle of combining theory with practice is fundamental. Whether one studies well or not depends entirely on whether one uses it well. To use it is the sole purpose and the sole means of studying Mao Zedong Thought. We must study with a purpose, study what we need to do, and use what we have learned. If we do not combine it with practice, learn it but do not use it, get a hundred points in reading but fail in action, what good is it!

To use Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's soul and guide practice is a long-term task for every comrade, requiring repeated and intense struggle. Whether one can achieve the unity of theory and practice depends first of all on whether one has a thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit. Without the determination to transform oneself, without the courage to expose one's thoughts and fight errors, without uprooting bourgeois ideology, one cannot firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. Without a thorough revolutionary spirit, without the willingness to live a hard life, without going deep into the grassroots, without linking up with the masses, without investigation and study, without striving for practice, to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the subjective and objective worlds can only be an empty phrase.

Focusing on key points is also an important principle. Mao Zedong Thought is a comprehensive development of Marxism-Leninism, covering politics, economics, military affairs, culture, and other aspects, with extremely rich content. Food must be eaten one mouthful at a time, and battles must be fought one by one. In studying Mao Zedong Thought, we must concentrate our forces to fight annihilation battles. In a given period, according to the needs of the revolution and the situation, and according to one's own ideological and work situation, we must grasp a few basic viewpoints and study them in depth. We must not adopt an egalitarian approach. Egalitarianism is not dialectical. Without focusing on key points, one will expend a great deal of effort but achieve little.

A correct understanding often requires repeated cycles of practice and cognition. The process of mastering Mao Zedong Thought is a process of repeated study and practice. Basic viewpoints, such as the viewpoint that class struggle must never be forgotten, the viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly, the viewpoint of believing in and relying on the masses, the viewpoint that correct ideas come only from social practice, and the viewpoint of two-line struggle, must be studied repeatedly and applied repeatedly. Key articles must be read many times, some of them dozens of times. As for the "Three Articles," they must be studied as mottoes, studied for a lifetime, and used for a lifetime.

Repetition is not the same as repetition, nor is it staying at the original level. Practice is constantly developing, and thoughts are changing every day. By constantly combining new situations, studying diligently and practicing frequently, one will constantly have new understandings and new gains. In this way, one can gradually deepen one's understanding of Mao Zedong Thought and truly learn and use it.

Chairman Mao said: "When we first began to study Marxism, our ignorance or limited knowledge of Marxism was in contradiction with our knowledge of Marxism. However, through diligent study, one can transform ignorance into knowledge, limited knowledge into extensive knowledge, and the blindness towards Marxism into the ability to freely apply Marxism."

How well one studies Mao Zedong Thought depends on whether one studies it out of a high degree of revolutionary consciousness, with the deepest proletarian feelings, and with a hunger and thirst for knowledge. It depends on whether one studies diligently and with the right methods. As long as we make every effort, combine it with practice, focus on key points, study repeatedly, use repeatedly, and concentrate on application, over time, we will definitely be able to better understand Mao Zedong Thought, better apply Mao Zedong Thought, and gradually truly learn and master Mao Zedong Thought.

### 尽最大努力把毛泽东思想真正掌握起来

    尽最大努力把毛泽东思想真正掌握起来
    林彪同志号召我们，要尽最大的努力，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来。
    把毛泽东思想真正掌握起来，是时代的需要，是革命的需要，是做一个自觉的无产阶级革命战士的根本条件。没有掌握毛泽东思想，就分不清青红皂白，分不清敌我，分不清是非，就是糊涂人。没有掌握毛泽东思想，即使有着对毛主席、对人民的一片忠心，也不可能真正做好工作，还难免会犯这样那样的错误。毛泽东思想学得越多，用得越好，无产阶级立场就越坚定，思想和政策水平就越高，干革命的本事就越大。努力掌握毛泽东思想，是我们毕生的战斗任务。
    现在，我们绝大多数同志，对毛泽东思想，不是学不学的问题，而是真正学到没学到，真正会用不会用的问题。真正掌握毛泽东思想，就是要做到真正理解，熟练运用。真正掌握毛泽东思想，就是要自觉地无条件地做到：毛主席怎样说，我就怎样做。这是学习毛主席著作运动的新阶段向我们提出的努力方向和奋斗目标。
    毛主席说：“学习不是容易的事情，使用更加不容易。”“说学习和使用不容易，是说学得彻底，用得纯熟不容易。”毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命的科学，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。要真正理解它，熟练运用它，就要尽最大的努力，认真地学，刻苦地学。就要结合实际，抓住重点，反复学，反复用，在用字上狠下功夫。
    理论联系实际是一个根本原则。学得好不好，全看用得好不好。用，是学习毛泽东思想的唯一目的，也是掌握毛泽东思想的唯一途径。我们就是要带着问题学，有目的地学，做什么学什么，学了就用。不结合实际，学了不用，读书得一百分，行动不及格，顶什么事！
    用毛泽东思想改造灵魂，指导实践，对每个同志来说，都是一个长期的事情，都要经过反复不断的激烈的斗争。能不能做到理论和实际的统一，首先取决于有没有无产阶级彻底的革命精神。没有自我改造的决心，亮思想怕丑，斗错误怕痛，资产阶级思想的根子挖不掉，毛泽东思想的根子就扎不牢。没有彻底的革命精神，不愿过艰苦生活，不深入基层，不联系群众，不调查研究，不努力实践，要运用毛泽东思想改造主观世界和客观世界，那只能是一句空话。
    抓住重点也是一个重要原则。毛泽东思想是全面发展了的马克思列宁主义，政治、经济、军事、文化等等各方面都有，内容极其丰富。饭要一口一口地吃，仗要一个一个地打。学习毛泽东思想，也要集中力量打歼灭战。在一定时期，要根据革命的需要，形势的需要，根据自己的思想情况和工作情况，抓住几个基本观点，有重点地学，学深学透。不要搞平均主义。平均主义不合辩证法。没有重点地学，必然费力很大，成效甚少。
    一个正确的认识，往往要经过由实践到认识，由认识到实践的多次反复，才能完成。掌握毛泽东思想的过程，就是一个反复学习，反复实践的过程。基本观点，例如千万不要忘记阶级斗争的观点，全心全意为人民服务的观点，相信群众、依靠群众的观点，正确思想只能从社会实践中来的观点，一分为二的观点等等，要反复学，反复用。重点文章要多读、有的要读几十遍。至于“老三篇”，更要当作座右铭来学，学到老，用到老，学一辈子，用一辈子。
    反复并不是重复，并不是停留在原来的水平上。实践经常在发展，思想天天在变化。不断地结合新的情况，勤学多练，就会不断地有新的体会，新的收获。这样，对毛泽东思想，就能逐步加深认识，做到真正学到，真正会用。
    毛主席说：“当着我们刚才开始研究马克思主义的时候，对于马克思主义的无知或知之不多的情况，和马克思主义的知识之间，互相矛盾着。然而由于努力学习，可以由无知转化为有知，由知之不多转化为知之甚多，由对于马克思主义的盲目性改变为能够自由运用马克思主义。”
    毛泽东思想学得怎么样，就看你是不是出于高度的革命自觉，怀着最深厚的无产阶级感情，如饥似渴地学，认真刻苦地学。就看你用功不用功，方法对头不对头。只要我们尽最大的努力，结合实际，抓住重点，反复学，反复用，在用字上狠下功夫，时间长了，就一定能够更好地理解毛泽东思想，更好地运用毛泽东思想，逐渐地把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来。
