On November 3, Tiananmen Square was filled with joyous crowds as our great leader Chairman Mao received various revolutionary students and Red Guards for the sixth time. On the eastern viewing platform, a group of young revolutionaries was particularly excited. With tears of happiness, they gazed at Chairman Mao's benevolent smile, sometimes bursting into cheers and sometimes singing loudly. This group of young revolutionaries was the "Mao Zedong Thought Long March Propaganda Team" from Bengbu Railway Middle School.

This Long March Propaganda Team consisted of eleven students, with an average age of eighteen, including three female students. On the morning of September 11, this group of young revolutionaries set out from the banks of the Huai River, following the Jingpu Railway, walking for forty-four days, covering two thousand miles, passing through four provinces, and arriving in the red capital. Today, they finally saw the great leader Chairman Mao, whom they had longed for day and night!

The Duty of the Red Guards

These eleven young revolutionaries set out with the determination to experience the hardships and see the world among the masses.

They said: To be a revolutionary, one must first roll in the mud of poor and lower-middle peasants, first sweat like a worker, and undergo a tough test.

They said: Rather be a pine tree on the cliff than a flower in the greenhouse!

They practiced the Long March with a lofty purpose: to be propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

They said: We are the descendants of the working class, Red Guards nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Propagating Mao Zedong Thought is our duty!

Their main form of propaganda was through artistic performances.

Initially, someone proposed this idea, and a few students expressed doubt: "Most of us have never performed before. Can we do it?"

Everyone took this question to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Reading is learning, using is also learning, and it is more important learning.... Often it is not learning first and then doing, but doing and then learning. Doing is learning." Chairman Mao's teachings instantly boosted everyone's confidence.

One student said: "We sing with red hearts to praise Chairman Mao. Even if our skills are poor, we will definitely be welcomed by the workers and peasants."

With this boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, they took drums, erhu, and a few simple instruments and started their propaganda performances. With no prepared programs, they wrote their own; unable to compose music, they used local tunes like Suzhou dialect, Liuqin melody, and Hubei flower drum to write lyrics.

Along the way, they performed at every station, especially paying attention to performances at small stations with few cultural activities. They said: "Even if there is only one person watching, we will perform. One more person understanding Mao Zedong Thought adds one more force for the revolution."

One day, they arrived at Baijiazhuang Station. The workers were all on duty, and only three workers' family members came to watch their performance. They still performed seriously. The three family members were moved and said: "After watching your performance, we understand many truths. We should also learn from you, study Chairman Mao's works, and care about national affairs."

Once, they had been walking all day, everyone was tired and hungry. But upon entering Hanzhuang Town, the crowd demanded a performance. After discussing, they decided that their own fatigue and hunger were nothing compared to the need to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and meet the crowd's demands. They put down their bags, started beating the drums, and performed on the spot. They performed enthusiastically, the audience watched happily, and the performance lasted nearly an hour, forgetting all fatigue. The crowd, seeing their enthusiasm in propagating Mao Zedong Thought, rushed forward to encourage them: "Like you, who love Chairman Mao and can endure hardships, you are truly worthy of being Chairman Mao's Red Guards!"

In over forty days, they performed over one hundred and twenty times for more than a hundred stations and villages along the railway. Over ten thousand people watched their performances. They also distributed tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda leaflets and slogans, and four hundred booklets on the Cultural Revolution. Their enthusiastic propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought's revolutionary spirit was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers and peasants. Along the way, they received over one hundred and fifty letters of praise.

The process of propagating Mao Zedong Thought was also a process of learning Mao Zedong Thought. After each performance, they studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with the masses. Each time they performed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda piece, they deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's related teachings. Each time they performed a piece praising Chairman Mao, they added a bit more love for the great leader. When they encountered difficulties in propaganda, they consulted Chairman Mao's works.

On September 12, it was their first performance. At that time, everyone lacked experience and was very nervous, resulting in singing off-key, the erhu strings not matching, and the reed pipe breaking. This made some people a bit discouraged and their confidence wavered. What to do? That night, everyone opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades must see achievements and see light in difficult times, and raise our courage." Everyone's hearts brightened, and those whose confidence had wavered became firm again.

This was learning and using combined. They felt that Chairman Mao's works were particularly solid on this journey.

The Deepest Education

Along the way, they had extensive contact with the masses. The broad masses of workers and peasants' boundless love for Chairman Mao and boundless admiration for Mao Zedong Thought deeply moved them. This was the deepest education they received during their Long March.

In Tengxian Station, there was an electrician named Han Yang. After watching their performance, he went home and brought out his cherished Mao Zedong plaster statue, giving it to them, and said excitedly: "I give you my most precious gift. With Chairman Mao's statue, you will have boundless strength; with Chairman Mao's statue, you will never lose your way. I hope you listen to Chairman Mao's words and forever follow the path Chairman Mao points out!"

Once, when the No. 1785 locomotive from Jinan passed by, the crew members specially threw down a letter. The letter said: "We heard you are walking to Beijing, and we are moved. We congratulate you. We wish you a victorious arrival in Beijing. When you see our leader Chairman Mao, please convey our greetings to him on behalf of us workers."

When performing in Botou Station, team member Zhang Shun's coat buttons fell off. A careful auntie in the audience noticed this. As soon as the performance ended, the auntie came with needle and thread. Unfortunately, both buttons were missing, and he had no spare ones. The auntie then took two buttons from her own clothes and sewed them on. Zhang Shun was so grateful he didn't know what to say. The auntie said while sewing: "Doing this little thing for you is right. Chairman Mao said, all revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other! When you get to Beijing, please convey my greetings to Chairman Mao. That is my greatest wish."

When the Long March Propaganda Team left Hanzhuang Station, the railway workers sent them off again and again, and repeatedly instructed them to persist to the end, walk to Beijing, and convey the station workers' greetings to Chairman Mao. When parting, they also handed a letter to the leader of the Long March Propaganda Team, instructing: "When you encounter difficulties, open this letter." Once, they rehearsed programs late into the night, got up early the next day, and walked until eight or nine o'clock, everyone felt very tired. At this time, the leader opened the workers' letter. It contained two quotations from Chairman Mao: "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous combat (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." "Resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings and the workers' sincere expectations brought great strength to the Long March Propaganda Team. Everyone rallied their spirits, recited these two quotations along the way, and walked over eighty miles, finally reaching their destination.

Vivid and Lively Learning

The two-thousand-mile journey was a two-thousand-mile political classroom. The members of the Long March Propaganda Team organized various vivid and lively learning activities along the way, greatly tempering and raising their thoughts. They said: "Leaving school for forty-four days, we learned things we hadn't learned in over ten years in school."

Before setting out, they recited Chairman Mao's quotations by the Huai River, gazed at Beijing and took an oath; in Tai'an, they visited the revolutionary martyrs' cemetery and learned about the martyrs' heroic deeds; in Yanzhou, they listened to a report from an advanced production team's member on how they actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, raised their ideological awareness, and significantly increased wheat production; in Fengtai, they met with all members of the heroic "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew. All these experiences gave them vivid education. As they themselves felt: "With every step forward, we are closer to Chairman Mao, and our thoughts are raised a step higher."

Team member Xu Jie, on the first day of leaving Bengbu, walked fifty-four miles, and his feet were swollen and red. At night, lying down, he felt a burning sensation. The question of whether he could persist arose in his mind. Going forward, there were still two thousand miles, and he was worried about enduring the hardship; going back, he felt it was not good for his face. At this moment, he remembered the quotation from Chairman Mao he read on the Huai River dike: "Tens of thousands of martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us raise their banners and march forward in their blood!" Chairman Mao's words gave him the courage to move forward again. He confessed his wrong thoughts to his comrades and set out again with renewed spirit. The hardworking and struggling deeds of the workers and peasants along the way and the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs prompted him to constantly consider this question: If one cannot endure hardships, how can one carry on the revolution? Seeking comfort, isn't this putting "me" first? He realized that although he came from a worker's family, he must not relax his ideological transformation. Along the way, he strictly demanded of himself, no matter how many blisters his feet had, how painful it was to walk, he did not complain, and he finally walked to Beijing in victory.

Li Tianyou was an only child and had never left his mother's side. In the first few days of setting out, he dreamed of his mother every night, and when he tried his two legs, they ached and sometimes he couldn't help but shed tears. After visiting the martyrs' cemetery in Tai'an, he thought of those who sacrificed their lives for the people's liberation cause and felt very ashamed. At this time, he realized that he was a young sapling that had not experienced wind and rain and needed to be tempered. Afterwards, he no longer thought of his mother but of his parents' history of begging for food. He resolved to inherit the glorious tradition of revolutionary martyrs and laboring people, tempering himself into a staunch successor of the revolutionary cause. He not only walked without fearing hardship and fatigue but also actively helped others carry things, took care of comrades with poor health, and when staying, he actively swept the floor and fetched water, doing everything first.

Xu Jie and Li Tianyou's progress was a microcosm of the entire Long March Propaganda Team's progress. The two-thousand-mile journey made their feet tough and their thoughts red. They resolved to carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end with a spirit of daring to think and act, and to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life. The workers and peasants along the way also praised: "Only young people tempered in this way will be reliable successors of the revolutionary cause!"

    毛泽东思想引导我们长征
    ——蚌埠铁路中学十一名小将长征记
    十一月三日，天安门广场万众欢腾，我们伟大领袖毛主席第六次接见了各地革命师生和红卫兵。在东观礼台上，一群革命小将特别激动。他们含着幸福的眼泪，仰望着毛主席的慈祥笑容，一会儿纵情欢呼，一会儿放声高歌。这群革命小将，是蚌埠铁路中学的“毛泽东思想长征宣传队”。
    这个长征宣传队由十一名学生组成，平均年龄十八岁，其中还有三个女同学。九月十一日黎明，这群小将从淮河边上出发，沿着津浦铁路，步行四十四天，走了二千里路，经过四个省份，来到红色首都。今天，他们终于见到了日夜想念的伟大领袖毛主席！
            红卫兵的天职
    这十一名革命小将，是怀着到群众中经风雨、见世面的决心踏上征途的。
    他们说：要做革命人，就要先滚一身贫下中农的泥巴，先出一身工人阶级的汗水，经受一番艰苦的磨炼。
    他们说：宁做山崖上的青松，不做温室里的花朵！
    他们演习长征，还抱着一个崇高的目的，就是做一名毛泽东思想的宣传员。
    他们说：我们是工人阶级的后代，是毛泽东思想哺育成长的红卫兵，宣传毛泽东思想是我们的天职！
    他们宣传的主要形式是文艺演出。
    开始有人提出这个建议，也有个别的同学表示怀疑：“咱们多数人没有演过节目，能行吗？”
    大家带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。……常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”毛主席的教导，一下子使大家增强了信心。
    有的同学说：“我们是用红心歌颂毛主席，技巧再差，也一定会受到工农群众的欢迎。”
    他们就是这样怀着对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限热爱，带上锣鼓、胡琴等几件简单的乐器，就搞起宣传演出来了。没有节目，就自己编写；不会作曲，就用泗洲调、柳琴腔、湖北花鼓等地方曲调填词。
    一路上，站站都演，特别注意为平时文娱活动少的小站演出。他们说：“就是有一个人看也要演。多一个人掌握毛泽东思想，就为革命多增加一分力量。”
    有一天，他们来到白家店车站，工人都在值班，只有三个工人家属来看他们表演。他们照样十分认真地演了一场。三个家属感动地说：“看了你们的节目，懂了很多道理。俺们也要向你们学习，好好学习毛主席著作，关心国家大事。”
    有一次，他们长途跋涉了一整天，大家又累又饿。可是一进韩庄镇，群众就要求演出。大家一商量，认为自己累一点饿一点没有什么，宣传毛泽东思想，满足群众的需要，就是我们的最大幸福。他们便放下背包，敲起锣鼓，就地演了起来。他们演得起劲，观众看得得意，演出将近一个小时，什么疲劳也忘掉了。群众看到他们这么热心宣传毛泽东思想，纷纷上前鼓励他们：“像你们这样热爱毛主席，又能吃大苦的人，真正不愧是毛主席的红卫兵！”
    四十多天中，他们为铁路沿线的上百个车站和村镇演出了一百二十多场，有上万人看了他们的演出。他们还散发了上万张宣传毛泽东思想的传单标语，散发了四百册宣传文化大革命的小册子。他们热情宣传毛泽东思想的革命精神，受到广大工农群众的热烈欢迎。一路上，收到表扬信一百五十多封。
    宣传毛泽东思想的过程，也是学习毛泽东思想的过程。每次演出，他们都和群众一起学习《毛主席语录》。每逢演出一次宣传毛泽东思想的节目，就对毛主席的有关教导有了进一步的理解。每逢演出一次歌颂毛主席的节目，就增加一分对伟大领袖的热爱。宣传中遇到了困难，他们就向毛主席著作请教。
    九月十二日，是他们第一次演出的日子。当时，大家没有经验，心情特别紧张，结果唱不成调，胡琴对不好弦，笛膜也弄坏了。这样一来，有人有点泄气，信心发生动摇。怎么办呢？当天晚上，大家打开《毛主席语录》，学习毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”大家的心都亮堂了，信心动摇的人又坚定了。
    这是学用结合，学了就用。他们感到，这一路上毛主席著作学得特别扎实。
          最深刻的教育
    一路上，他们广泛接触了群众。广大工农群众对毛主席的无限热爱，对毛泽东思想的无限崇拜，使他们深受感动。这是他们长征途中受到的最深刻的教育。
    滕县车站有个电务工人叫韩阳，看完他们的演出以后，转身回家把自己心爱的毛主席石膏像拿出来，送给他们，并且激动地说：“我把最珍贵的礼物送给你们，你们带上毛主席的像，会增加无穷的力量；带上毛主席的像，永远不会迷失方向。希望你们听毛主席的话，永远沿着毛主席指引的道路前进！”
    有一次，济南一七八五号机车经过他们身边的时候，包车组的同志特地投下了一封信。信里说：“听说你们步行上北京，我们很感动，我们向你们祝贺。祝你们胜利到达北京。希望你们见到我们的领袖毛主席时，代我们工人向他老人家问好。”
    在泊镇车站演出的时候，队员张顺的上衣钮扣掉了两个，被台下一位细心的大娘发现了。刚演完戏，这位大娘就拿了针线来找他。不巧，两个扣子都不见了，他身边又没有现成的。大娘便顺手拆下自己身上的两个扣子，给他钉上。张顺感激得不知道说什么才好。这位大娘边缝边说：“给你们干这点事，是应该的。毛主席说过，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助嘛！你们到了北京，替我问候问候毛主席，就是我最大的心愿。”
    长征宣传队离开韩庄车站的时候，铁路工人们送了一程又一程，并且再三嘱咐他们一定坚持到底，走到北京，代全站工人向毛主席问好。临别的时候，他们还把一封信交给长征宣传队队长，嘱咐说：“你们遇到了困难的时候，再拆开看。”有一次，头天晚上排练节目，很晚才睡，第二天一大早就赶路，走到八九点钟的时候，大家都感到很疲劳。这时候，队长打开了工人们的信。一看，里面是两条毛主席语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的亲切教导，工人阶级的殷切期望，给长征宣传队的同志们带来了巨大的力量。大家振作精神，一路上不停地轮流背诵这两条语录，一连走了八十多里路，胜利到达目的地。
          生动活泼的学习
    两千里征途，就是两千里路的政治课堂。长征宣传队的同志们，沿途组织了各种生动活泼的学习活动，使自己的思想得到了大锻炼、大提高。他们说：“离开学校四十四天，学到了在校十多年没有学到的东西。”
    临出发，他们在淮河边朗诵毛主席语录，遥望北京宣誓；在泰安，他们瞻仰了革命烈士陵园，学习了烈士英雄事迹；在兖州，他们听了一个先进生产队的社员活学活用毛主席著作，提高了思想觉悟，使小麦产量显著提高的经验介绍；在丰台，他们会见了英雄的“毛泽东号”机车包乘组全体同志。这一切，使他们受到了生动的教育。就像他们自己所体会的那样：“每前进一步，就靠近毛主席一步，思想就提高一步。”
    队员徐杰，从蚌埠出发的头一天，走了五十四里路，两脚就磨得充血发红，晚上躺下来觉得火辣辣的。能不能坚持到底的问题，在脑子里活动起来了。往前走吧，还有两千里，担心吃不下这个苦；往后走吧，又觉得面子上不好看。就在这个时候，他想起了在淮河堤上宣誓时读过的毛主席语录：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”毛主席的话，使他重新鼓起了前进的勇气。他向同志们检讨了自己的错误想法，又精神抖擞地上路了。沿途工农群众艰苦奋斗的事迹和革命先烈的革命精神，促使他不断考虑这样一个问题：不能吃苦耐劳，怎能接好革命的班？贪图安逸，这不是“我”字当头吗？他意识到自己虽然出身于工人家庭，但也决不能放松思想改造。一路上，他严格要求自己，脚上泡再多，走起路来多么痛，他也不哼一声，一直胜利地走到了北京。
    李天友是个独生子，从来没有离开过母亲身边。出发头几天，他每天晚上，都梦见妈妈，再试试两条腿，又痠又疼，有时不禁暗暗流下眼泪。他在泰安参观了烈士陵园以后，想想那些为了人民解放事业而贡献出自己生命的先烈们，感到非常惭愧。这时候，他才认识到自己是一棵没有经过风雨的幼苗，需要加紧锻炼。以后，他不再想妈妈了，想的是父母逃荒讨饭的苦史。他下定决心继承革命先烈和劳动人民的光荣传统，把自己锻炼成坚强的革命事业接班人。他不但走起路来不再怕苦，怕累，而且主动帮助别人背东西，照顾身体不好的同志，住下来就主动扫地，打水，样样事情抢着干。
    徐杰、李天友的进步过程，正是长征宣传队全体队员进步的缩影。两千里路的征途，使他们脚板开始走硬了，思想开始炼红了。他们决心以敢想敢干的精神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，决心跟着毛主席革命一辈子。沿途工农群众也赞扬说：“这样锻炼出来的青年人，才会是可靠的革命事业接班人！”
