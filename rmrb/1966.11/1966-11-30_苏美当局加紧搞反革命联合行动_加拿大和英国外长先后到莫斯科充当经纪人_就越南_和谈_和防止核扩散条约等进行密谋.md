Moscow, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- At the invitation of the Soviet leadership, Canadian Foreign Minister Martin and British Foreign Secretary Brown recently visited Moscow in succession. They held talks with the Soviet authorities on how to find a way out for the U.S. war in Vietnam and the non-proliferation treaty that the Soviet Union and the United States are urgently seeking to conclude.

Martin and Brown arrived in the Soviet Union on Nov. 9-13 and Nov. 22-25 respectively. During their visits, they held talks with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, discussing issues such as the Vietnam problem, non-proliferation, disarmament, and the European situation. According to Tass, Gromyko said at a banquet held for Martin on Nov. 12 that he was "satisfied to note" that on "some issues related to these problems," the Soviet and Canadian sides "either agreed or were very close" in their views. Regarding the Soviet-British talks, Brown said in a statement to reporters on Nov. 25 that during his extensive discussions with Soviet leaders, he had received "the closest cooperation" from the Soviet leaders, and that the talks were "very harmonious" and "very encouraging."

The common plot to suppress the Vietnamese people's anti-American national liberation struggle is the current focus of Soviet-American cooperation in jointly suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, and it is also the most important issue in the current Soviet-Canadian and Soviet-British talks.

According to reports, before Brown's visit to the Soviet Union, he had exchanged views with Johnson's special envoy Harriman in London on the "Vietnam peace strategy" and had brought a message from the United States on the Vietnam issue to the Soviet authorities: "If Hanoi agrees to negotiations, even informal negotiations, the United States will stop bombing." In addition, Canadian Foreign Minister Martin brought a new peace plan on the Vietnam issue when he visited Moscow.

As for the Soviet side, it is reported that during the Soviet-Canadian and Soviet-British talks, the Soviet leaders did not mention the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam but only proposed that "the United States stop bombing North Vietnam as a condition for starting talks" as "the first step towards peace in Vietnam."

In addition to the Vietnam issue, the non-proliferation treaty that the Soviet Union and the United States are urgently seeking to conclude, as well as disarmament, comprehensive cessation of nuclear tests, and freezing the European situation, were also important topics in the talks with Martin and Brown. According to various reports, during the discussions on these issues, the Soviet leaders repeatedly expressed their eagerness to the Canadian Foreign Minister and the British Foreign Secretary, hoping to "make progress" on these issues, and believed that concluding the non-proliferation treaty was particularly "urgent and important."

    苏美当局加紧搞反革命联合行动
    加拿大和英国外长先后到莫斯科充当经纪人
    就越南“和谈”和防止核扩散条约等进行密谋
    据新华社二十八日讯  莫斯科消息：应苏联领导集团的邀请，加拿大外交部长马丁和英国外交大臣布朗最近先后到莫斯科，同苏联当局就如何为美国侵越战争寻求出路和苏美正在急谋成交的防止核扩散条约等问题进行会谈。
    马丁和布朗是先后于本月九日到十三日和二十二日到二十五日期间接踵到苏联的。在访苏期间，他们同苏联部长会议主席柯西金和外交部长葛罗米柯等人举行会谈，共同讨论了越南问题、防止核扩散、裁军、欧洲局势等问题。据塔斯社报道，葛罗米柯十二日在为马丁举行的宴会上谈到这次苏加会谈时，“满意地指出”，“在同这些问题有关的一些问题上”，“在这些问题的一些方面”，苏加双方“的观点要么是吻合的，要么是非常接近的”。关于苏英会谈，布朗二十五日也对记者发表谈话，说在他同苏联领导人进行的范围广泛的讨论中，他“得到了苏联领导人最密切的合作”，双方谈得“非常投机”、“非常令人鼓舞”。
    共同策划扑灭越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是当前苏美合作共同镇压世界人民革命斗争的重点，也是这次苏加、苏英会谈的一个最主要的问题。
    据报道，布朗这次到苏联以前，曾同约翰逊的特使哈里曼在伦敦就“越南和平战略”交换过意见，并在这次来苏时给苏联当局“带来了美国关于越南问题的口信：如果河内同意进行谈判，即使非正式的谈判，美国也将停止轰炸”。此外，加拿大外长马丁这次到莫斯科时，也“携带了一个新的关于越南问题的和平计划”。至于苏联方面，据透露，在这次苏加、苏英会谈中，苏联领导人都只字不谈要美国侵略军立即从越南撤出去，而只提出，“要求以美国停止轰炸北越作为开始进行和谈的条件”，作为“走向越南和平的第一步”。
    除越南问题以外，苏美两国正在急于成交的缔结防止核扩散条约问题，以及裁军、全面停止核试验、冻结欧洲局势等问题在这次同马丁和布朗的会谈中也占重要地位。据各方面报道，在讨论这些问题时，苏联领导人对加拿大外长和英国外交大臣曾一再表示了急不可待的心情，希望在这些问题上
  “取得进展”，而且认为，缔结防止核扩散条约尤其是“迫在眉睫的和重要的”。
