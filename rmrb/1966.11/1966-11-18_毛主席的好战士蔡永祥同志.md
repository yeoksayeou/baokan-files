Edition: 4

Comrade Cai Yongxiang sacrificed his precious life to smash the political plots of the class enemy, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to defend the highest interests of the people. He is a hero of the great era of Mao Zedong, a loyal soldier of Chairman Mao, and a good son of the people.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang emerged during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a selfless communist new person who devoted himself to the public. His brilliant life was one of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. It was a life completely and thoroughly devoted to the people.

Cai Yongxiang was only eighteen years old and had been in the army for just eight months. He was able to grow so rapidly into a communist soldier entirely because of the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang followed Chairman Mao's teachings, never forgetting class bitterness and always remembering class hatred. He was born into a poor peasant family with deep grievances. After joining the army, he underwent a series of class education, especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, where he studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. He truly understood class and class struggle, transforming from a son of a poor peasant into a conscious proletarian revolutionary soldier. He stood tall and looked far, always keeping class struggle and proletarian dictatorship in mind, firmly holding his gun, and following Chairman Mao in making revolution.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang studied and applied the "Three Articles" diligently, using them as his guiding principles to transform his worldview. With deep proletarian feelings, he studied Chairman Mao's works day and night, with great enthusiasm. He said, "Studying Chairman Mao's works must touch the soul. A revolutionary's mind must not have any selfish thoughts." He deeply understood that ideological transformation means eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. When he achieved something, he looked for shortcomings; when he was criticized, he found the reasons; when he encountered problems, he studied Chairman Mao's works and applied what he learned. He put his ideological transformation under the supervision of the masses, treating others' criticisms as the greatest class friendship, and fought against selfishness. He always demanded of himself to be completely and thoroughly selfless, striving to be a noble person, a pure person, a person of morality, a person free from lowly interests, and a person beneficial to the people.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang lived for the revolution and died for the revolution. He was extremely devoted to his comrades and the people, always helping others and putting others before himself, doing many good deeds without seeking recognition. He worked diligently, took on heavy responsibilities, and considered doing more work as the greatest happiness. In his mind, there were only comrades, only others, only the revolution, and no self. He devoted himself to the revolution and to the people, daring to climb mountains of knives and walk through fires, and when the people's interests required his sacrifice, he willingly gave his life.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang loved Chairman Mao immensely and was extremely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "It is because of Chairman Mao that there is Cai Yongxiang. Chairman Mao is forever the red sun in my heart." He kept Mao Zedong Thought in his mind, studied it diligently, practiced it, and was willing to die defending it. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he had deep hatred for a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who opposed Mao Zedong Thought, repeatedly stating, "Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our revolution. Whoever dares to oppose it, we will smash them to pieces!" When the cunning class enemy placed obstacles on the tracks, attempting to kill a train of Red Guards at a critical moment, he stepped forward, fearless of sacrifice, and rescued the special train carrying Red Guards, making a significant contribution to defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

Although Comrade Cai Yongxiang has left us forever, his heroic image will forever live in our hearts. His selfless communist morality will forever be our example to learn from. By learning from Comrade Cai Yongxiang, we will definitely respond most resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call, care about state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We will firmly support the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, guard our posts, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

By learning from Comrade Cai Yongxiang, we will definitely implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, take the "Three Articles" as our guiding principles, thoroughly break down the bourgeois "self," thoroughly establish the proletarian "public," completely transform our worldview, and turn our army and militia organizations into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

By learning from Comrade Cai Yongxiang, we will forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Let us stride forward boldly on the great road of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely!

    毛主席的好战士蔡永祥同志
    浙江省军区政治委员　龙潜
    蔡永祥同志为了粉碎阶级敌人的政治阴谋，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫人民的最高利益，献出了宝贵的生命。他是伟大毛泽东时代的英雄，是毛主席的忠诚战士，人民的好儿子。
    蔡永祥同志是在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，涌现出来的一心为公的共产主义新人。他的光辉的一生，是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，活学活用毛主席著作的一生，是完全、彻底为人民的一生。
    蔡永祥只有十八岁，入伍仅仅八个月，他所以能如此迅速地成长为共产主义战士，完全是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。
    蔡永祥同志遵照毛主席的教导，不忘阶级苦，牢记阶级仇。他出生在一个苦大仇深的贫农家庭里。入伍后，经过了一系列的阶级教育，特别是在无产阶级文化大革命的风浪中活学活用毛主席著作，真正懂得了阶级和阶级斗争，从一个贫农的儿子，成为一个自觉的无产阶级革命战士。他站得高，看得远，身在连队，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，紧握手中枪，跟着毛主席闹革命。
    蔡永祥同志狠学狠用“老三篇”，以“老三篇”为座右铭，改造自己的世界观。他以深厚的无产阶级感情，废寝忘食，如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作。他说：“学习毛主席著作，必须触及灵魂。革命战士的头脑里，容不得半点私心杂念。”他深刻地认识到思想改造就是破私立公。他有了成绩找缺点，受了批评找原因，遇到问题就学习毛主席著作，学了就用；他把自己的思想改造放在群众监督之下，把别人的批评当作最大的阶级友爱，狠斗“私”字。他时时刻刻都用“完全”、“彻底”和两个“极端”来要求自己，努力做一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
    蔡永祥同志生为革命生，死为革命死。他对同志对人民极端热忱，助人为乐，舍己为人，做了大量的好事而不留姓名。对工作勤勤恳恳，勇于挑重担子，把多做工作看成是最大的幸福。在他的头脑里，只有同志，只有他人，只有革命，就是没有自己。他一心为革命，一心为人民，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，为了人民的利益需要他牺牲的时候，毫不犹豫地献出自己的生命。
    蔡永祥同志，无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想。他说：“有了毛主席，才有我蔡永祥，毛主席永远是我心中的红太阳。”他脑子里铭记的是毛泽东思想，刻苦学习的是毛泽东思想，身体力行的是毛泽东思想，誓死保卫的是毛泽东思想。他在无产阶级文化大革命中，对一小撮反对毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子，有刻骨的仇恨，一再表示：“毛泽东思想是我们革命的命根子，谁敢反对，就砸它个粉身碎骨！”当阴险的阶级敌人在铁轨上设下障碍，妄图扼杀一列车红卫兵的紧急关头，他挺身而出，不怕牺牲，抢救运送红卫兵的专车，为保卫毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命作出了重大的贡献。
    蔡永祥同志虽然和我们永别了，但是他的英雄形象永远活在我们的心中。他的一心为公的共产主义品德，永远是我们学习的榜样。学习蔡永祥同志，我们一定最坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。坚决拥护以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，坚守岗位，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级专政。
    学习蔡永祥同志，我们一定坚决贯彻林彪同志的指示，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，把“老三篇”作为座右铭，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，彻底改造世界观，把部队和民兵组织办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    学习蔡永祥同志，我们一定永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想！让我们在毛泽东思想的大道上，昂首阔步，奋勇前进！
