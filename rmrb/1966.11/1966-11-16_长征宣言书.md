We are the Long March Red Guards of Dalian Maritime University. We are infinitely loyal to the Party and infinitely love Chairman Mao. Our hearts yearn for the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the holy land of world revolution—Beijing. We eagerly hope to fly to the side of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. However, to carry forward the glorious tradition of the old Red Army and to liberate the army, we have formed the Long March Red Guards and set out on foot towards Beijing! We solemnly declare: the Long March Red Guards set out from Dalian at dawn on August 25!

In the past, countless revolutionary forerunners sacrificed their lives to liberate us from suffering, fighting bravely and shedding blood. Today, for the happiness of future generations and to ensure that our great motherland will never change color, we are also ready to endure hardships and shed our last drop of blood at any time. The idea that one can engage in revolution without undergoing hardships and that victory can be achieved with just a moment of enthusiasm is extremely wrong and extremely harmful. Not only in the years of war, but also now and in the future, there will still be countless obstacles. To make a revolution, to strive, there will be difficulties, there will be sacrifices.

Currently, under the personal leadership of our great commander Mao Zedong, an unprecedented, mass-scale Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is rapidly developing with the momentum of a surging tide. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death struggle between the bourgeoisie's plot to restore power and the proletariat's counterattack. It is a great class struggle. In this great revolution that touches people's souls, not only does one need fearless revolutionary spirit and abundant revolutionary enthusiasm, but one also needs iron-willed revolutionary perseverance, with an unshakable determination and will to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Revolutionary students and teachers must never forget the glorious traditions of our Party and army, and must never forget the spirit of hard struggle. Just as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing vigorously, it is even more necessary to carry forward the Long March spirit of the old Red Army and to cultivate the spirit of the People's Liberation Army in enduring hardships and hard work. For this reason, we have finally decided to take this arduous path.

Our Long March Red Guards are facing a great revolutionary test. Since we were born, from primary school to university, in our more than twenty years of life, have we ever faced such a test? In the span of one month, we carry our luggage and set out with our two feet, studying and propagating along the way, covering more than two thousand miles without taking the train or bus. Since our departure, we do not know how many blisters have formed on our feet, how much sweat we have shed, crossing mountains and rivers, undeterred by wind and rain. If you ask us young people whether we have ever experienced such hardships, the answer is no, never! This is the first time in our lives!

What is the significance of our Long March? Our Long March is a declaration. It proclaims to the world: the Red Guards of the Mao Zedong era and all revolutionary youth are heroes, fearing neither hardship nor death, seeking neither fame nor gain. They can take over the revolutionary cause, and Chairman Mao can rest assured! It shows that they have an indestructible revolutionary will. To seek revolutionary truth and learn from revolutionary experience, they can endure great hardships and hard work, and face all kinds of severe tests. It sends a vow to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: the revolutionary heirs will closely follow Chairman Mao, determined to temper themselves into thorough proletarian revolutionaries in the face of storms and waves, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Our Long March is a powerful demonstration against all ghosts and monsters. Landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, listen up: we are the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, the good descendants of the old Red Army and the Eighth Route Army, and the strong reserve force of the People's Liberation Army. History will declare the complete failure of your plot of "peaceful evolution," and your calculations will be completely wrong! We will pass down the revolutionary red flag from generation to generation, never forgetting class struggle, never forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forgetting to emphasize politics, never forgetting to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, so that our great motherland will always be revolutionary, will never change color, and will always move forward!

Our Long March is both a pilgrimage for scriptures and a propaganda team. Along the way, we will tirelessly study, implement, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, defend Mao Zedong Thought. We will study and apply the Sixteen Points, propagate and apply the Sixteen Points. We will humbly learn from the Red Guards and revolutionary masses along the way, first learning their spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, gaining revolutionary experience, and preparing to make the cultural revolution in our units and regions better after the Long March. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that if Chinese youth do not combine with the workers and peasants, they will achieve nothing. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the same. In the movement to sweep away the old and establish the new, the Red Guards and revolutionary youngsters have played a certain leading role, but the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is still the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The Long March Red Guards insist on combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learning the class feelings of old workers, old poor peasants, and old revolutionaries along the way, learning their revolutionary spirit and style. We strive to gain their support for revolutionary students and teachers, bringing their revolutionary feelings, sincere hearts, and sincere love for the Party and Chairman Mao to Beijing and back to the school. We feel extremely honored to undertake such a mission!

Our Long March is also a seed-sowing machine. It first touches our souls, sowing revolutionary seeds deep in our thoughts, which will surely yield a great harvest in the future. It will ignite the revolutionary torch in our hearts, making it unforgettable for life! We also sincerely hope that our actions will have an impact on those few revolutionary forerunners who have forgotten hardships, are content with enjoyment, and are accustomed to sitting in offices. We ask you not to forget the days of war and fire! We ask you, in the name of revolution, to think of the past, think of the days when you followed Chairman Mao through thousands of miles of marches and countless battles, and most sincerely hope that you will bravely stand up and revolutionize! Forgetting the past means betrayal!

The Long March Red Guards are loyal defenders of Mao Zedong Thought. We will resolutely resist and fight against anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. If counter-revolutionaries dare to sabotage and disrupt us, we will mercilessly suppress them! The Long March Red Guards strictly adhere to the three main disciplines and eight points for attention personally formulated by Chairman Mao, and always cultivate the three-eight work style of the People's Liberation Army.

Since our departure, we have faced wind and rain, seen the world, liberated and educated ourselves, and have made great gains in our thoughts and increased our revolutionary abilities. Along the way, we have received great support and enthusiastic encouragement from the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and all revolutionary masses. They have expressed their hope that we will persist in walking to Beijing and greet Chairman Mao.

However, there are still some comrades who do not understand the revolutionary significance of our Long March, our revolutionary spirit, and perseverance, saying, "Modern transportation is so convenient and free, why bother?" "This is self-inflicted suffering, a waste of time." Some even doubt whether we can persist to the end. Indeed, there will be many difficulties on our way forward. But compared to the conditions and roads the Red Army faced, we are infinitely stronger, and compared to the 25,000-li Long March, it is simply not comparable. Our country is a socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and we are revolutionary youth of the Mao Zedong era. What difficulties can we not overcome?

The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of a long march; ten thousand waters and mountains are as nothing.
The Long March Red Guards once again solemnly declare: we will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for us, we will not disappoint the expectations of the revolutionary masses along the way, and we will not stop until we reach Beijing!

Tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed themselves for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us raise high their red revolutionary flags and march forward bravely on their bloodstained paths!

Long live the revolutionary spirit of the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March!
Long live the spirit of proletarian revolutionary hard bones!
Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    长征宣言书
    大连海运学院船电61级长征红卫队
    我们是大连海运学院的长征红卫队。我们无限忠于党，无限热爱毛主席，颗颗红心向往无产阶级文化大革命的中心、世界革命的圣地——北京，日夜盼望着一下子飞到党中央和毛主席的身边。但为了发扬老红军的光荣传统，大学解放军，我们特此组成了长征红卫队，迈开我们的双脚，步行走向北京！我们庄重宣告：长征红卫队已经在八月二十五日清晨从大连出发了！
    过去，无数革命前辈为了解除我们的苦难，抛头颅，洒热血，前赴后继，流血牺牲。今天，我们为了下一代的幸福，为了使我们伟大的祖国永不变色，也随时准备经受千辛万苦，不惜流尽最后一滴血。那种认为现在干革命就可以不经过艰苦的考验，只凭一时的热情就能胜利的想法，是极端错误、极端有害的。不仅在战争年代里，就是在现在，在将来，还仍然会有重重险阻，要革命，要奋斗，就会有困难，就会有牺牲。
    当前，由我们伟大的统帅毛主席亲自领导的史无前例的、群众性的无产阶级文化大革命，正在以排山倒海之势迅猛地开展。无产阶级文化大革命，是资产阶级阴谋复辟和无产阶级反复辟的一场你死我活的斗争，是一场阶级大搏斗。在这场触及人们灵魂的大革命中，不仅要有大无畏的革命精神和充沛的革命热情，而且还要有钢铁般的革命毅力，以不可动摇的决心和意志，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。革命师生万万不可忘记我党我军的光荣传统，决不能忘记艰苦奋斗的作风。正当无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈开展着的时候，更需要百倍地发扬老红军的长征精神，大力培养解放军吃大苦、耐大劳的作风。正因为如此，我们终于决定走这一条艰苦的道路。
    我们长征红卫队，正在面临着巨大的革命考验。自从我们出生到现在，从小学到大学，在二十几年的人生历史中曾有过这样的考验吗？在一个月的光阴中间，我们背着行李，要开动每个人的两只脚，边学习，边宣传，不乘火车，不坐汽车，长驱二千余里。自从出发以来，我们脚上不知磨出了多少血泡，不知流了多少汗，跋山涉水，风雨无阻。若问我们这些年青人，曾经历过这样的艰难吗？没有，从来没有！这是有生以来第一次！
    我们这次长征有什么意义呢？我们的长征是宣言书。它向全世界宣告：毛泽东时代的红卫兵和所有革命青年是英雄好汉，他们不怕苦，不怕死，不图名，不图利，他们能够接好革命的班，请毛主席他老人家放心！它说明，他们有不可摧毁的革命意志，为了寻求革命真理，取革命之经，他们能够吃大苦，耐大劳，经受一切艰难困苦的严峻考验。它向党中央和毛主席发出我们的誓言：革命的红后代，紧紧跟着毛主席，决心在大风大浪中，把自己造就成彻底的无产阶级革命硬骨头，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我们的长征是对一切牛鬼蛇神的一次强有力的示威。地、富、反、坏、右五类分子你们听着：我们是无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是老红军、老八路的好后代，是解放军的强大后备军。历史必将宣告你们“和平演变”阴谋的彻底破产，你们在我们身上打的如意算盘完全打错了！我们誓把革命红旗一代一代地传下去，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，使我们伟大的祖国永远革命，永不变色，永远向前！
    我们的长征是取经队，同时又是宣传队。我们一路上要不知疲倦地学习毛泽东思想，执行毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想。学习熟悉十六条，宣传运用十六条。我们要向沿途的红卫兵和革命群众虚心地学习，首先学习他们无产阶级的革命造反精神，取得革命经验，以待长征结束之后，将本单位本地区的文化大革命搞得更好。毛主席曾多次教导我们，中国青年如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。这场无产阶级文化大革命，也同样如此。在扫四旧、立四新的运动中，红卫兵们、革命小将们起到了某种带头作用，但是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军仍然是广大的工农兵群众。长征红卫队坚持与工农兵相结合，沿路努力学习老工人、老贫农、老革命的阶级感情，学习他们的革命精神和革命作风。争取他们对革命师生的支持，把他们的革命感情、一片丹心以及热爱党和毛主席的真挚感情，带到北京去，带回学校去。我们为能担任这样的使命而感到无比的光荣！
    我们的长征又是播种机。它首先触及我们每个人的灵魂，在思想的深处撒下了革命的种子，将来必定会大有收获。它将给我们点燃心中的革命火把，它将使我们终生难忘！我们又衷心地希望我们的行动对少数忘记艰苦，安于享受，惯于坐办公室的革命前辈们有所触动。我们请你们不要忘记战火纷飞的年代吧！请你们以革命的名义，想想过去，想想你们当年跟着毛主席行军万里、南征北战的艰苦岁月，最恳切地希望你们勇敢地站出来革命！忘记过去就意味着背叛！
    长征红卫队，是毛泽东思想的忠实捍卫者。凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，我们都要坚决地进行抵制和斗争。如果反革命分子胆敢对我们进行破坏和捣乱，我们将最无情地镇压他们！长征红卫队严格地遵守毛主席亲自制定的三大纪律、八项注意，随时培养解放军的三八作风。
    长征红卫队自从出发以来，经风雨，见世面，自己解放自己，自己教育自己，已经在思想上有了极大的收获，大增革命的才干。我们在沿途中，到处受到广大工农兵、红卫兵及所有革命群众的极大支持和热情鼓励，他们纷纷表示，希望我们坚持走到北京，向毛主席问好。
    但是也有个别同志对我们长征的革命意义，对我们的革命精神和毅力还很不理解，说什么“现代交通工具如此方便，又可免费，何苦呢？”“这是自讨苦吃，浪费时间。”甚至有人怀疑我们能否坚持到底。的确，在我们前进的道路上，还将有很多困难。但是比起当年红军所处的条件、所走的道路，真不知强了多少倍，与二万五千里长征相比，简直不能相提并论。我国是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，我们是毛泽东时代的革命青年，又能有什么困难不可战胜呢？
    红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲。
    长征红卫队再一次庄严地宣告：我们决不辜负毛主席对我们的期望，决不辜负沿途革命群众对我们的期望，不走到北京非好汉！
    成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们鲜红的革命旗帜，踏着他们的血迹奋勇前进吧！
    红军二万五千里长征的革命精神万岁！
    无产阶级革命硬骨头精神万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    无产阶级的革命造反精神万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
                  一九六六年九月十日
