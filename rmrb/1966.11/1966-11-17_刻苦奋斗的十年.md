Chairman Mao said: "The cooperative led by Liu Yuru is similar to the cooperative led by Wang Guozhan in Hebei Province. Both were looked down upon because of their poverty, but through hard work and struggle, they finally overcame their difficulties. There are many such examples in every province, and they should be widely publicized to encourage everyone."

Chairman Mao's comments have inspired us in a way that words cannot express. We have engraved them in large golden letters, framed them, and hung them on the wall of the brigade office so that the commune members can see and read them every day and follow Chairman Mao's instructions in everything they do.

Over the past ten years, the history of our Xiaoguang Brigade has been a history of class struggle, a history of promoting the ideological transformation of people according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and a history of hard work and struggle.

In 1956, we transitioned to a higher-level cooperative, and in 1958, we achieved the establishment of the people's commune. Although our collective has grown larger and the situation has changed, our spirit of hard work and struggle has not changed at all. All the undertakings of our brigade, including setting up a blacksmith forge, a mill, and engaging in sideline productions such as weaving and quarrying, as well as buying carts and horses, digging wells and building dikes, and transforming barren mountains, have all been achieved through self-reliance and thrift. When funds were insufficient, we raised them ourselves; when tools were broken, we repaired them ourselves. We paid attention to saving both in big and small ways. From 1956 to 1962, the collective did not buy a single sack for delivering public grain; instead, commune members voluntarily lent their own sacks to the brigade for use. In meetings discussing the brigade's production expenses, commune members always emphasized: "We must not forget the old tradition of hard work and struggle!"

Last winter, commune members braved the cold and worked hard for three months to dig a mechanized well and ten earthen wells. Building the well shaft required more than four hundred cartloads of stones. Our brigade had never quarried stones before, and someone suggested buying them from outside. After studying Chairman Mao's works, everyone unanimously felt that we should, as Chairman Mao taught, place our policy on the basis of our own strength and insist on self-reliance. With this spirit, we organized manpower to go to the nearby mountains to quarry stones. Not only did we solve the problem of stones for building the well shaft, but we also prepared a large amount of stones for building river dikes and pig pens.

After completing this task, we studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and launched a discussion on "maintaining what has been achieved or creating new achievements." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, everyone decided to transform more than two hundred mu of barren mountains and wastelands, thoroughly changing the face of Xiaoguang Brigade. Since last winter, commune members have used their spare time to go to the mountains with Chairman Mao's works, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and struggle, and in one go turned over the barren mountains and wastelands. Some planted trees, and some prepared to turn them into fields, further developing production.

Because we resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, the great spiritual power has turned into tremendous material wealth. The once-ridiculed poor cooperative has, through hard work and struggle, become a proud and prosperous brigade. Grain yield per mu has increased from one hundred and seventy or eighty jin to four hundred and ten jin, exceeding the grain production target set by the Agricultural Development Outline, and cotton production has more than doubled compared to the great leap forward year of 1958. Collective sideline productions have also greatly developed, presenting a situation of comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline productions, and fisheries.

Recently, we held a meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's comments on Xiaoguang Commune. We studied the People's Daily editorial "The Whole Country Should Become a Big School of Mao Zedong Thought." The broad masses of commune members and cadres expressed their determination to turn our brigade into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought, making the broad masses of commune members into conscious communists who can farm, work, fight, and write articles criticizing the bourgeoisie, and passing down Chairman Mao's instructions and teachings from generation to generation.

    刻苦奋斗的十年
    辽宁锦县晓光人民公社晓光大队党支部书记　刘玉如
    毛主席说：“刘玉如领导的这个合作社，同河北省的王国藩合作社相似，都是因为穷，被人看不起，经过刻苦奋斗，终于战胜了困难的。各省都有许多这样的例子，应当广为传播，鼓励大家。”
    毛主席的这个批语对我们的鼓舞，是千言万语都无法表达的。我们把它刻成大金字，用镜框镶起来，挂在队办公室墙上，让社员们天天看，天天念，事事照毛主席指示去做。
    十年来，我们晓光大队发展的历史，是阶级斗争的历史，是按照毛主席的教导促进人的思想革命化的历史，也是刻苦奋斗的历史。
    一九五六年，我们转入了高级合作社，一九五八年，又实现了人民公社化。虽然家大业大了，情况变化了，可是，我们的刻苦奋斗的精神一点也没有变。我们这个大队办的一切事业，包括办铁匠炉，办粉坊，开展编织、采石一类的副业生产，以及添车买马，打井修堤，改造荒山等等，都是靠自力更生，靠勤俭创业。资金不够自己筹，农具坏了自己修，不但注意从大处节约，也注意从小处节约。一九六二年以前的八年中间，集体送公粮没有买过一条麻袋，都是社员主动把自己的麻袋借给队里使用的。在讨论队里的生产开支问题的会议上，社员们总是强调：“我们可不能忘掉刻苦奋斗的老传统！”
    去年冬天，社员们冒着严寒，苦战三个月，打了一眼机井和十眼土井。砌井筒需要四百多车石头，我们大队过去没有采过石头，有人主张出外去买。经过学习毛主席著作，大家一致感到，要像毛主席教导的那样，把我们的方针放在自己力量的基点上，坚持自力更生。本着这一精神，我们组织人力到附近的山上去打，不但砌井筒的石头全部解决了，还为修河堤、修猪圈准备了大量石头。
    这项任务完成以后，我们又学习了《愚公移山》和《将革命进行到底》等文章，展开了“守业还是创业”的讨论。在毛泽东思想的指引下，大家决心把二百多亩荒山和荒草淀子治好，彻底改变晓光大队的面貌。社员们去冬以来，利用农闲时间，带着毛主席著作上山，发扬刻苦奋斗的革命精神，一鼓作气把荒山和草淀翻过来，有的栽上树，有的准备修成田，进一步发展生产。
    由于我们坚决照毛主席的指示办事，伟大的精神力量变成了巨大的物质财富。原来被一些人讥笑的穷合作社，经过刻苦奋斗，已经成为值得自豪的一个富裕大队了。粮食亩产由一百七、八十斤增加到四百一十斤，超过了农业发展纲要规定的粮食产量指标，棉花也比大跃进的一九五八年增产一倍多。集体副业也大大发展，出现了农林牧副渔全面发展的局面。
    最近，我们举行了纪念毛主席给晓光社的批语发表十周年大会，学习了人民日报社论《全国都应该成为毛泽东思想的大学校》。广大社员和干部表示，决心把我们大队办成毛泽东思想的大学校，使广大社员成为又会种地、又会做工、又会打仗、又会写文章批判资产阶级的有觉悟的共产主义新人，把毛主席的指示和教导世世代代传下去。
