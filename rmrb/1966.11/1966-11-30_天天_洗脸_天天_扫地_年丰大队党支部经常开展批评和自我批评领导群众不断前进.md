The party branch of Nianfeng Production Brigade, the earliest collective production unit organized in Jiangxi Province after liberation—Luxi Commune, Pingxiang City—follows Chairman Mao's teachings, frequently engages in self-criticism, humbly listens to the opinions of the masses, and earnestly corrects shortcomings and errors, leading the masses to make continuous progress. Over the past decade, this brigade, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of "organizing together," has relied on its own efforts and worked hard to achieve one victory after another. The once poor Nianfeng is now a place where there is no fear of drought when it is sunny and no fear of floods when it rains. Low-yield fields have become high-yield fields, and there have been consecutive bumper harvests. Every household has electric lights, and machines are humming everywhere. The poor village has become a rich village, and the fields have been transformed. The villagers sing, "Chairman Mao points the way, organizing together gives us strength. People change their minds, the land changes its appearance, and happiness will last for a thousand years."

Nianfeng Brigade Party Branch Secretary Yi Ruisheng is a nationally renowned agricultural labor model. Since 1951, when he became the leader of a mutual aid group, he has always been the leader of this collective production unit. Yi Ruisheng firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teaching in the article "Organizing Together": "Comrades, you are the leaders of the people, your work has achieved great results, but I hope you will not be complacent." He constantly examines the shortcomings and errors in his work and constantly fights against the tendencies of complacency and arrogance.

In 1965, despite a major disaster, the brigade achieved a bumper harvest. Some people became complacent and relaxed their preparations for the next year's production. Yi Ruisheng seized this opportunity and, together with the branch members, reviewed Chairman Mao's article "Organizing Together." Chairman Mao said: "We must not become complacent and self-satisfied at the sight of achievements. We should curb complacency and constantly criticize our shortcomings, just as we wash our faces and sweep the floor every day to keep clean and remove dust."

Yi Ruisheng became more and more uneasy as he studied. He said excitedly, "Chairman Mao clearly teaches us that we should not be complacent when we achieve success, but we became arrogant and complacent after the harvest. If we do not thoroughly solve this problem and let it develop, our work will regress." He seriously conducted self-criticism, and other branch members also engaged in criticism and self-criticism. On this basis, the brigade cadres went out multiple times to observe, learn, compare with advanced units, find gaps, revise production plans, increase production measures, and actively prepare for the 1966 production. As a result, this year's production scale and labor efficiency both surpassed the great leap year of 1958. Early rice achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a total output 20% higher than in 1965. Diversified operations also developed.

To frequently listen to the opinions of the masses and engage in criticism and self-criticism, the Nianfeng Brigade Party Branch has also adopted and formulated many measures and systems. For example, they insist on prioritizing politics, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, relying on the masses in everything, and believing in the masses in everything; they use Chairman Mao's dialectical approach to examine and summarize work, constantly finding gaps, and so on.

Recently, the cadres and members of Nianfeng Brigade held a meeting to commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Organizing Together." Everyone recalled the tremendous changes before and after liberation and before and after organizing together, unanimously agreeing that "organizing together has boundless power, collective production turns poverty into wealth." At the meeting, Party Branch Secretary Yi Ruisheng read over and over again a passage from Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Organizing Together," encouraging everyone: "But we should not be complacent. We still need to continue self-criticism and continue to seek progress. Our production also needs to continue to seek progress."

The masses of Xipu Brigade, Shenzhou Commune, Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, remember Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the "poor stick" spirit, and engage in large-scale water conservancy projects, turning a large number of barren lands into fertile fields. Now, the irrigated land in Xipu Brigade has increased from more than 20 mu ten years ago to over 800 mu, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total cultivated land in the brigade.

    天天“洗脸”  天天“扫地”
    年丰大队党支部经常开展批评和自我批评领导群众不断前进
    江西省解放后最早组织起来的集体生产单位——萍乡市芦溪公社年丰大队的党支部，遵照毛主席的教导，经常开展自我批评，虚心听取群众意见，认真改正缺点错误，使工作和生产不断前进。十多年来，这个大队在毛主席“组织起来”的方针指导下，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，取得了一个又一个的胜利。过去人穷地穷的年丰，现在是：天晴不怕旱，落雨不怕洪，低产变高产，连年保丰收，户户电灯亮，处处机器响，穷村变富村，田园换新装。社员们歌唱道：“毛主席，指方向，组织起来有力量，人换思想地换装，幸福生活万年长。”
    年丰大队党支部书记易瑞生，是全国著名的农业劳动模范，他从一九五一年担任互助组长起，一直是这个集体生产单位的带头人。易瑞生牢牢记住毛主席在《组织起来》这篇文章中的这一教导：“各位劳动英雄和模范生产工作者，你们是人民的领袖，你们的工作是很有成绩的，我希望你们也不要自满。”他不断地检查工作中的缺点错误，不断地向骄傲自满思想开火。
    一九六五年，这个大队大灾之年获得丰收，有些人自满起来，放松了第二年生产的准备工作。易瑞生抓住这件事，与支部的同志一道重新学习了毛主席的《组织起来》一文。毛主席说：
  “我们决不能一见成绩就自满自足起来。我们应该抑制自满，时时批评自己的缺点，好像我们为了清洁，为了去掉灰尘，天天要洗脸，天天要扫地一样。”易瑞生越学心里越不平静，他激动地说：“毛主席明确地教导我们，有成绩不要自满，可是我们得到了丰收，就骄傲自满，故步自封。这个问题不彻底解决，让它发展下去，我们的工作就会倒退。”他严肃地进行了自我批评，其他支委也进行了批评和自我批评。在这个基础上，大队干部多次外出参观、学习，比先进，找差距，修订生产计划，增加生产措施，积极为一九六六年生产做好准备。结果，今年的生产规模，劳动效果，都超过了大跃进的一九五八年。早稻获得了空前大丰收，总产量比一九六五年增长百分之二十。多种经营也有了发展。
    为了经常听取群众的意见，经常开展批评和自我批评，年丰大队党支部还采取和制定了许多措施、制度。例如，坚持突出政治，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，事事依靠群众，事事相信群众；注意用毛主席一分为二的观点检查和总结工作，时刻找差距等等。
    最近，年丰大队的干部社员召开座谈会，纪念毛主席的光辉著作《组织起来》发表二十三周年。大家回忆了解放前后和组织起来前后的巨大变化，一致认为：“组织起来，威力无穷，集体生产，由穷变富。”座谈会上，党支部书记易瑞生一遍又一遍地读着毛主席在《组织起来》这篇光辉著作中说的一段话，鼓励大家：“但是我们不应该自满，我们还要继续作自我批评，还要继续求进步。我们的生产也要继续求进步。”

    河北省遵化县建明公社西铺大队广大社员，牢记毛主席的教导，发扬“穷棒子”精神，大搞水利建设，使大批坏地变成了良田。现在西铺大队的水浇地由十年前的二十多亩发展到八百多亩，占全大队的耕地面积的三分之二以上。这是西铺大队社员在修渠引水。
