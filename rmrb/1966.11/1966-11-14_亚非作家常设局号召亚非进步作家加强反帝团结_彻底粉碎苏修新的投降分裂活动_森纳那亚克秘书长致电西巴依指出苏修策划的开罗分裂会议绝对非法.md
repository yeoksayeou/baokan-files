The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau today issued a strong statement denouncing and exposing the new plot by Soviet splitters in Cairo to further split the Afro-Asian writers' movement. The statement of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau on the Cairo Afro-Asian Writers' Fake Third Congress Preparatory Committee is as follows:

In accordance with the decision of the emergency meeting in Beijing, which represents 53 Afro-Asian countries (including 20 out of 23 executive committee member countries) and regions and five Afro-Asian international organizations, the Colombo Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau and the Beijing Executive Secretariat have formulated a comprehensive plan for the preparations for the successful convening of the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Congress to be held in China next year.

In the process of formulating this plan, the Colombo Bureau and the Beijing Executive Secretariat have respectfully considered the suggestions put forward by many writers' organizations in Afro-Asian countries.

The Bureau is pleased to announce that in the past two to three months, it has issued a series of statements and telegrams supporting the struggles of the peoples of Afro-Asian countries, such as the Vietnamese people, the Guinean people, and the Malaysian people, exposing and condemning the splitters' meeting in Baku planned by the Soviet splitters.

In accordance with the resolution passed by the Beijing emergency meeting to promote Afro-Asian writers' literary activities and strengthen the creative conditions of Afro-Asian writers, preparations are being made to establish an Afro-Asian Writers' Publishing House. The Bureau's publication "Call" has been published in English, French, and Arabic. The Afro-Asian Literature Series is also being continued in English and French. An Afro-Asian Writers' Sanatorium has also been established in China.

To further strengthen the friendship between Afro-Asian writers and promote the exchange of Afro-Asian literature and culture, the Bureau is preparing to send two delegations to visit some Afro-Asian countries.

Just as the Bureau is successfully implementing the decisions and resolutions of the Afro-Asian Writers' Congress and the Beijing emergency meeting and preparing for the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Congress to be held in China, the Soviet revisionists, who have lost their position in our movement due to their betrayal and splitter activities in accordance with their capitulationist line, are desperately trying to counter our movement by holding an illegal preparatory committee meeting in Cairo this month. They are preparing to hold an illegal "Third Congress" in Beirut, Lebanon, in February-March next year, further creating splits and further sabotaging the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of Afro-Asian writers and peoples, serving the interests of American imperialism. They are preparing to hold a meeting in Beirut attended by traitors, revisionists, that is, the running dogs and lackeys of American imperialism, and reactionaries, and are trying to deceive some people who do not know the truth into participating in this meeting.

The Bureau considers it its duty to expose these plots of the Soviet revisionists. Thus, all Afro-Asian writers who oppose imperialism, old and new colonialism, and stand on the side of developing national culture will take necessary actions to thoroughly criticize and strongly denounce them, making this splitter meeting attended only by the aforementioned reactionaries, isolating them, heavily striking them, and smashing their splitter activities.

The Bureau's position has been clearly expressed in the statements issued recently, repeatedly condemning the splitter activities planned by the Soviet revisionist writers' leadership in Cairo and Baku.

All anti-imperialist Afro-Asian writers have recently defeated the splitter plot centered in Moscow. While once again congratulating them, the Bureau calls on all patriotic and progressive Afro-Asian writers to hoist high the banner of our anti-imperialist revolution, expose their new plot being planned in Cairo this month, and give a fatal blow to those traitors and revisionists, the number one running dogs of American imperialism, and the reactionary leaders, further strengthening our anti-imperialist unity.

New China News Agency, November 12th: After the failure of the splitter meeting in Baku organized by Soviet splitters, they decided to hold a fake Afro-Asian Writers' Third Congress Preparatory Committee in Cairo this month, attempting to further split the Afro-Asian writers' movement. To maintain unity and oppose splits, the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, S. N. Senanayake, sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Congress UAR Liaison Committee, Sibai, on the 12th of this month, pointing out that the fake preparatory committee planned by Soviet revisionists in Cairo is absolutely illegal and instructing Sibai to immediately come to Beijing to participate in the preparations for the "Third Congress" to be held in China next year. The text of the telegram from Senanayake to Sibai is as follows:

According to reports from member countries, they have received invitations from the fake preparatory committee issued by you. The fake preparatory committee planned by Soviet splitters is absolutely illegal and will not have a good outcome. I am currently working with member countries to implement the resolutions of the emergency meeting in Beijing, which was attended by 53 Afro-Asian countries and regions and five Afro-Asian organizations, and actively preparing for the "Third Congress" to be held in China. As the Secretary-General of the Bureau, I instruct you to immediately come to Beijing to participate in the preparations for the "Third Congress" to be held in China next year.

    亚非作家常设局号召亚非进步作家加强反帝团结
    彻底粉碎苏修新的投降分裂活动
    森纳那亚克秘书长致电西巴依指出苏修策划的开罗分裂会议绝对非法
    新华社十二日讯　亚非作家常设局今天发表强有力的声明，谴责和戳穿苏联分裂主义者在开罗策划进一步分裂亚非作家运动的新阴谋。亚非作家常设局关于开罗亚非作家伪三大筹备委员会的声明如下：
    根据代表着五十三个亚非国家（其中包括有二十三国执行委员会成员国中的二十国的代表）和地区及五个亚非国际组织的北京紧急会议的决定，科伦坡亚非作家常设局和北京执行书记处已为明年将在中国召开的第三届亚非作家大会的胜利召开制定了一个全面的筹备工作的计划。
    在制定这个计划的过程中，科伦坡常设局和北京执行书记处尊重地考虑了许多亚非国家的作家组织提出的建议。
    常设局高兴地宣布：在这两三个月里，常设局发表了一系列的声明、电报支持亚非人民的斗争，比如越南人民、几内亚人民、马来亚人民的斗争，揭露和谴责苏联分裂主义者所策划的巴库分裂会议。
    根据北京紧急会议通过的关于促进亚非作家文学活动和加强亚非作家创作条件的决议，为建立亚非作家出版社的安排工作正在进行之中。常设局刊物《号召》已用英、法、阿三种文字出版。亚非文学丛书也用英、法文在继续出版。亚非作家疗养院也已在中国建立。
    为了进一步加强亚非作家之间的友谊和促进亚非文学、文化的交流，常设局正准备派出两个代表团到一些亚非国家进行友好访问。
    正当常设局在胜利地执行亚非作家会议和北京紧急会议的决定和决议并为在中国召开的第三届亚非作家大会作准备的时候，由于按照他们的投降主义路线进行破坏和分裂活动而丧失了他们在我们运动中的地位的苏联修正主义者，疯狂而绝望地企图通过策划本月中在开罗召开非法的筹委会会议，与我们运动对抗，为明年二——三月在黎巴嫩的贝鲁特召开非法的“三大”作准备，从而制造进一步的分裂，以便进一步破坏亚非作家、亚非人民的反帝革命事业，为美帝国主义效劳。他们正准备在贝鲁特召开一个由叛徒、修正主义分子也就是美帝国主义的帮凶、走狗以及反动派参加的会议，还企图欺骗一些不明真相的人参加这个会议。
    常设局认为有责任揭露苏联修正主义者策划的这些阴谋。这样，反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和站在发展民族文化的立场上的一切爱国的、进步的亚非作家将采取必要行动，彻底批判和强烈公开谴责他们，使这一分裂会议只有和他们沆瀣一气的上述反动派参加，孤立他们，沉重地打击他们，粉碎他们的分裂活动。
    常设局的这一立场，已在不久前不断发表的谴责苏联修正主义作家领导集团在开罗和巴库策划的分裂活动的声明中表达得十分清楚了。
    一切反帝的亚非作家最近击败了以莫斯科为中心的分裂阴谋。常设局在再一次对他们表示祝贺的同时，呼吁所有爱国的、进步的亚非作家高举我们反帝革命的战斗旗帜，揭露他们本月中正在开罗策划的新阴谋，给予那些叛徒、修正主义者，也就是美帝国主义的头号帮凶同反动派头目们以致命的打击，进一步加强我们的反帝团结。
    新华社十二日讯　苏联分裂主义者召开的巴库分裂会议遭到惨败后，又决定在本月中在开罗召开伪亚非作家第三届大会筹委会，企图进一步分裂亚非作家运动。亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克为了维护团结，反对分裂，特于本月十二日电亚非作家会议阿联联络委员会秘书长西巴依，指出苏联修正主义者阴谋召开开罗伪筹委会是绝对非法的，指示西巴依立刻到北京参予筹备明年在中国召开“三大”事。森纳那亚克秘书长给西巴依的电文如下：
    根据成员国向我报告：他们已接到你发出的伪筹委会的邀请。在苏联分裂主义者策划下的伪筹委会是绝对非法的，不会有任何的好下场。我正同成员国在执行有五十三个亚非国家和地区及五个亚非组织参加的北京紧急会议的决议，积极筹备在中国召开“三大”，作为常设局秘书长，我指示你立即来北京参予筹备明年在中国召开“三大”事。
