The French Marxist-Leninist Communist Movement's central organ, "New Humanity Daily," recently published a statement saying: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China, and the actions taken by the Red Guards under the inspiration of the thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong, the contemporary Lenin, "continuously inspire the French people, especially the youth."

The statement emphasizes that in France, "everyone is showing the strongest concern for the People's Republic of China, for its heroic Red Guards, and for the source of all revolutionary theory and practice of the contemporary proletariat—Mao Zedong Thought."

The statement mentions that the Lyon branch of the French Marxist-Leninist Communist Movement recently distributed a newsletter it edited, which reprinted the decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution adopted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 8, 1966. This received an especially warm welcome from university students and ordinary youth.

The statement of "New Humanity Daily" says that the executive committee of the French Marxist-Leninist Communist Movement in the Rhone Delta published a pamphlet in Marseille. These pamphlets directly refute the shameful rumors and slanders spread by reactionaries and revisionists against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The pamphlets emphasize that what they are attacking is the socialist world fortress, the unity of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world in their victories against American imperialism. It is not surprising that fascists, Social Democrats, and revisionists have joined forces, as their common goal is to oppose communism and hate revolution.

Not long ago, the French Marxist-Leninist Communist Movement held a report meeting in Paris to introduce the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong were hung on the stage, along with a banner reading, "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" and "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!"

    法国《新人道报》发表公报说
    中国文化大革命激励着法国人民
    据新华社巴黎电　法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）中央机关报《新人道报》最近发表公报说：中国目前进行的文化大革命，以及红卫兵在当代的列宁——毛泽东主席的思想鼓舞下带头采取的行动，“不断地激励着法国人民，特别是青年”。
    这篇公报强调指出，在法国，“到处都对中华人民共和国、对它的英勇的红卫兵、对当代无产阶级一切革命理论和实践的源泉——毛泽东思想，表示最强烈的关心”。
    公报谈到，法国共产主义运动里昂支部最近散发了它编辑的新闻公报，其中转载了中国共产党中央委员会一九六六年八月八日通过的关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，受到了大学生和普通青年的特别热烈的欢迎。
    《新人道报》的公报说，法国共产主义运动罗纳河口区执行局在马赛出版了小册子。这些小册子针锋相对地回击了反动派和修正主义者对中国文化大革命散布的可耻的造谣和诽谤。小册子强调指出：他们所攻击的是社会主义的世界堡垒，是越南人民、中国人民和全世界人民反对美帝国主义的胜利的团结。法西斯分子、社会民主党人、修正主义分子汇合在一起，是并不令人奇怪的，他们的共同点就是反对共产主义和仇视革命。（附图片）
    不久前，法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）在巴黎举行报告会，介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的情况。主席台上悬挂着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛泽东的像和一幅写着“中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”的标语。　新华社发
