The first plenary session of the Asian Committee of the Games of the New Emerging Forces was held in Phnom Penh on November 23, 24, and 27, and concluded today. The meeting was presided over by Huang Zhong, acting chairman of the committee. Representatives and observers from 17 countries and regions attended the meeting. The chairman of the Games of the New Emerging Forces Federation, Maladi, also attended the meeting.

The meeting adopted a communiqué.

The communiqué first enthusiastically supported the first Asian Games of the New Emerging Forces being held in Phnom Penh. The communiqué stated that this event is a major demonstration by the peoples and athletes of Asian countries against imperialism and neo-colonialism led by the United States, marking a significant milestone in the history of Asian and world sports. This event will further promote the development of sports among the peoples of Asian countries. The meeting highly praised the efforts made by the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Cambodian people, under the patronage of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the head of state of Cambodia, to ensure the success of this event.

The communiqué stated that the meeting strongly condemned the actions of a small group of imperialist elements within the International Olympic Committee and other reactionary international sports organizations, who obstructed friendly exchanges between athletes from various countries, infringed upon national sovereignty, and attempted to sabotage the first Asian Games of the New Emerging Forces. The meeting solemnly declared that it is the inalienable right of the peoples of all countries to develop sports independently, to organize all international competitions freely, and to allow all new emerging forces to participate in such international competitions without any restrictions.

The communiqué also pointed out that the era of imperialism imposing its will on others has passed; the will of the peoples of all countries to be masters of their own fate is an irresistible historical trend that no force can stop.

The communiqué pointed out that for Asian countries that have long suffered from foreign rule and oppression, in order to achieve and defend national independence, it is necessary to carry out the struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism to the end. Only under such conditions can sports truly belong to the people and develop and improve continuously.

The meeting was pleased to note that the peoples of Asian countries have made remarkable progress in sports over the past year and called for: in the spirit of enhancing friendship, mutual promotion, and common development, and unity against imperialism, to continuously promote the independent development of sports in Asian countries, strengthen sports exchanges, encourage invitations and organization of more sports competitions; mutual visits between various sports teams and sports leaders, and on the basis of self-reliance and strengthening joint training, develop mutual assistance and cooperation.

The communiqué stated that the meeting issued an urgent call to Asian athletes, hoping that they would widely publicize the spirit of unity against imperialism and the independent development of the Games of the New Emerging Forces, actively prepare for the second Asian Games of the New Emerging Forces, and enthusiastically participate in the second Games of the New Emerging Forces to be held in 1967.

    新运会亚委会大会胜利闭幕发表公报指出
    亚洲各国必须把反帝反殖斗争进行到底
    紧急号召亚洲运动员积极筹备第二届亚新会和踊跃参加第二届新运会
    据新华社金边二十七日电　新兴力量运动会亚洲委员会第一届全体大会，二十三日、二十四日和二十七日在金边举行了三天会议后，今天宣告闭幕。
    今天的大会由委员会代理主席黄中主持，来自十七个国家和地区的代表和观察员出席了会议。
    新兴力量运动会联合会主席马拉迪也出席了会议。
    会议通过了一项公报。
    公报首先热烈支持正在金边举行的第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会。公报说，这届运动会是亚洲各国人民和运动员反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的一次大示威，是亚洲和世界体育运动史上的划时代的重大事件。这届运动会将进一步推动亚洲各国人民的体育运动的发展。大会高度赞扬了柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨人民在柬埔寨国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王的赞助下，为使这次运动会圆满成功而作出的努力。
    公报说，大会严厉谴责了国际奥林匹克委员会等反动国际体育组织的一小撮帝国主义分子阻挠各国运动员之间友好交往、损害各国主权、企图破坏第一届亚洲新运会的阴险行径。大会庄严宣告：完全独立地发展体育运动，自由地组织一切国际比赛，并允许一切新兴力量不受任何限制地参加这种国际比赛，是各国人民不可剥夺的权利。
    公报还指出，帝国主义继续把它的霸道强加于人的时代已经一去不复返了；各国人民当家作主的意志，是任何力量也阻挡不了的历史的潮流。
    公报指出，对于长期遭受外国统治和奴役的亚洲国家来说，为了获得和捍卫民族独立，就必须把反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争进行到底。只有在这种条件之下，体育运动才能真正属于人民，才能得到发展和不断提高。
    大会满意地指出，亚洲各国人民过去一年在体育运动方面获得了突飞猛进的发展，并号召：本着增进友好，互相促进，共同发展，团结反帝的精神，不断促进亚洲各国体育事业的独立发展，加强体育交流，鼓励邀请和组织更多项目的体育比赛；各种运动队和体育运动领导人之间相互访问，在自力更生和加强共同训练的基础上发展互助和合作。
    公报说，大会向亚洲运动员们发出紧急号召，希望他们广泛宣传团结反帝和新运会的独立发展的精神，积极筹备第二届亚洲新运会，并踊跃参加将在一九六七年举行的第二届新运会。
