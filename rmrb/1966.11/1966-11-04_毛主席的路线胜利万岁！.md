What is the reddest in the world?
The sun on Tiananmen is the reddest.
What is the most beloved in the world?
Chairman Mao is the most beloved.
What is the happiest in the world?
Seeing Chairman Mao is the happiest.

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, amidst the triumphant songs of the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line, on November 3, for the sixth time, received revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards from all over the country.

At 10:10, the song "The East is Red" stirred the hearts of ten thousand people and the hearts of hundreds of millions of people across the country. Our most beloved and respected person—Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform, radiant, and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central leaders, appeared on Tiananmen. Ten thousand excited hearts flew towards Chairman Mao, ten thousand hands holding up "Quotations from Chairman Mao" stretched towards Chairman Mao, ten thousand pairs of eyes filled with tears of joy looked up at Chairman Mao, and ten thousand people shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

In the surging sea of people, there were Red Guards from Shanghai, revolutionary teachers and students from Hunan, revolutionary youngsters from Zunyi, and revolutionary descendants from Yan'an. Shanghai is where the First National Congress of the Party was held. Since the First National Congress, Chairman Mao has always represented the Party's correct line. Hunan is where Chairman Mao went to the masses and initiated the peasant movement the earliest. Chairman Mao's correct line has won victory after victory in the struggle against various erroneous lines. Zunyi is where the historic Zunyi Conference was held. At the Zunyi Conference, Chairman Mao's leadership over the entire Party was established. Yan'an is the radiant revolutionary holy land. Chairman Mao led the people of the entire country to achieve brilliant victories in the Chinese revolution. Historical experience proves that following Chairman Mao's line is victory. The experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution also proves that only by following Chairman Mao's line can the Cultural Revolution be carried through to the end. These revolutionary teachers and students who came from places where Chairman Mao left his glorious history to Beijing, to Chairman Mao's side, today saw Chairman Mao, with boundless passion, cheered for the victory of Chairman Mao's correct line, and resolved to forever follow Chairman Mao's correct line forward.

A Red Guard from Xi'an No. 4 Middle School, short in stature and far away, could not see clearly and cried. His classmates lifted him high above their heads, passing him from one to another to the front of the Golden Water Bridge. A soldier from the People's Liberation Army took him and held him high, allowing him to see Chairman Mao clearly. At this moment, he smiled with happiness.

At this unforgettable moment, three students from Shanghai Blind School on the viewing platform held up the braille edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and cheered towards Tiananmen Gate Tower. They faced Chairman Mao, feeling a red sun rising in their hearts, and a thousand rays of red light shining in front of their eyes. Chairman Mao, radiant and smiling, was walking towards them. The Red Guards beside them told them: "Chairman Mao has seen you." They said: "We came to Beijing like people with sight, and we came to Chairman Mao's side like soldiers. Chairman Mao saw us, and we also saw Chairman Mao."

The Most Glorious Example

The meeting began, and Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, spoke amidst enthusiastic applause.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee proclaimed the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line. In the past two months, Chairman Mao's correct line has met with the broad masses and been grasped by the broad masses, launching a criticism of the erroneous line. Chairman Mao's call for everyone to care about state affairs has truly become the action of the broad masses. This is a great thing. This is an important guarantee for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." As soon as Comrade Lin Biao's words fell, the entire venue erupted in enthusiastic cheers.

Revolutionary teachers and students from the front lines of struggle, especially those revolutionary pioneers who had been suppressed by the bourgeois reactionary line, deeply felt that it was Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that supported them, that it was Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that liberated them. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is a line that is heart to heart with the broad masses!

In the past two months, revolutionary pioneers have all personally participated in the mass criticism of the erroneous line. They deeply felt that the bourgeois reactionary line is just a paper tiger. As long as they press on and pursue victory, they can defeat it. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is an invincible line!

With deep affection for Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the revolutionary youngsters continuously cheered for the great victory of this golden, shining revolutionary line!

A team of Red Guards from Lanzhou, amidst the surging revolutionary tide, passed through Tiananmen Square and in front of Chairman Mao. They held up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which they had studied hundreds of times, high above their heads, and with tears in their eyes, shouted over and over again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

This team had been suppressed by the bourgeois reactionary line. In those days of arduous struggle, every time the sun rose, they faced the sun, looked towards Beijing, and expressed their determination to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, for the sake of defending the great thought of Mao Zedong, we will fear neither climbing mountains of knives nor crossing seas of fire!" Every time night fell, they looked at the Big Dipper, thought of Tiananmen, and longed for the great leader: "Chairman Mao, we really want to see you! If you, Chairman Mao, know the situation here, you will surely give us the greatest support!"

Yes, in those days of arduous struggle, it was Chairman Mao who supported them. Every time they opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read: "Darkness is about to pass, dawn is just ahead," they saw a thousand rays of light before their eyes; every time they recited: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," they were full of energy. Chairman Mao's every instruction on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gave them great encouragement and strength.

Now, they have come to the side of the great leader and walked in front of the great leader. They were excited and moved, with a thousand words surging to their hearts. Many of them, as soon as they walked out of Tiananmen Square, wrote down their common resolve in their diaries: Resolutely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

In the parade, there were two "Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought" from out of town. As soon as they walked out of Tiananmen Square, they rushed to the Telegraph Building and sent a telegram to their Red Guard headquarters, reporting that they had seen the great leader Chairman Mao and that Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao were in good health, letting their comrades-in-arms share this greatest happiness.

When they were planning to expose the capitalist-roaders in power within the school, the first big-character poster by Nie Yuanzi and six others, supported by Chairman Mao, gave them courage. A fire ignited the revolutionary flames throughout the school.

When they were making revolution and faced criticism, obstacles, and even being labeled as "rightists" by some people, the "Sixteen Points" formulated under Chairman Mao's leadership gave them the sharpest weapon for revolutionary rebellion, removing the stumbling blocks of the movement.

When they were organizing the Red Guards and some people attacked them as "forming small groups" and "engaging in underground activities," Chairman Mao, on August 18, received the Red Guards at Tiananmen and wore a red armband, strongly supporting this new thing that had appeared on the horizon. Four days later, their representatives rushed to Tiananmen Square and took an oath in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, establishing their Red Guard organization in a dignified manner.

These two revolutionary pioneers excitedly said: Our situation, our demands, Chairman Mao always knows clearly! He, Chairman Mao, is like always being by our side!

From the coast of the South China Sea to the north and south of the Tian Shan Mountains, from the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, revolutionary youngsters from all over the country said with immense excitement: Our great leader Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and mobilizes the masses the most. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has most resolutely supported the pioneering spirit of the revolutionary masses.

They said: Today, Comrade Lin Biao expressed our common feelings that we cannot express: "Chairman Mao is the greatest proletarian revolutionary, always with the masses, fully trusting the masses, breathing with the masses, sharing destiny with the masses, and wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary mass movement. Chairman Mao has set the most glorious example for the entire Party and the younger generation." Chairman Mao, we, the younger generation, will definitely learn from you forever, learn, and learn again. We hope that the older generation of revolutionaries will also seriously learn from our great leader, learn, and learn again!

Great Democracy is Excellent

On Tiananmen Square, the great army of the proletarian cultural revolution, composed of revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards, like a vast and magnificent red river, surged forward. A new generation of people in our country's history, with "dare" as their motto, with Chairman Mao as the supreme commander, and with the People's Liberation Army as a glorious example, fear neither heaven nor earth, dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, and are now, with their wonderful youth, surging through the world.

Those who fear revolution and fear the masses are not saying they are arrogant? Red Guard warriors firmly answer: We are "arrogant"! "Pointing at the rivers and mountains, stirring up words, treating the nobles of a thousand households in the past as dung and soil."

Some people are not saying their ambitions are too great? Revolutionary youngsters firmly answer: Our "ambitions" are great! "For the sake of great sacrifices and great aspirations, daring to make the sun and moon change to a new sky."

"Truly lawless!" Those who cannot stand revolutionary behavior comment. Red Guard warriors decisively answer: We are "lawless," we "want to sweep away all harmful creatures, completely without enemies"!

Our revolutionary youngsters and the broad revolutionary masses, with the world as their responsibility, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, have created new experiences of developing great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This great democracy is the Party fearlessly allowing the broad masses to use the forms of big debates, big-character posters, big connections, and big discussions to criticize and supervise the Party and state organs at all levels and leaders at all levels.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past few months has fully proven: With this great democracy, it is possible to truly mobilize the masses, touch the depths of people's souls, and uproot the poisonous sprouts of revisionism as soon as they appear. A Red Guard from Henan said well: "Great democracy, for the enemy, is a people's war without guns, not missing a single ghost or snake. Great democracy, for the masses, is a revolutionary school without classes, where everyone can be educated and trained."

A Red Guard from Harbin introduced how they used great democracy to expose anti-Party elements. In mid-July, the masses touched the tails of those in power who were taking the capitalist road, and they jumped up, slandering it as "anti-Party." At this time, it was the great leader Chairman Mao's saying "Rebellion is justified" that encouraged everyone. Big-character posters, one after another, like cannon fire, aimed at the target; big debates, one sentence after another, refuted them to silence; big connections, you go east, I go west, concentrating the wisdom of the revolutionary masses, pushing the movement to a higher climax, exposing the ugly faces of ghosts and snakes in broad daylight.

Great democracy is a new form of combining Mao Zedong Thought with the broad masses, a new contribution of Chairman Mao to Marxism-Leninism on the theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. Revolutionary teachers and students in front of Tiananmen shouted: Great democracy is excellent!

At 4:30 PM, Chairman Mao put on a green military overcoat and waved to the crowd from Tiananmen.

On the eastern viewing platform, there was a team of revolutionary teachers and students who walked to Beijing. They were the "Long March Red Guards" from Jingzhao Agricultural Middle School in Linzi County, Shandong. The thirteen team members had an average age of less than eighteen.

Eight days ago, they set out on their journey with boundless love for the great leader, carrying backpacks weighing twenty or thirty pounds, pulling their own military pots and enough food for a month, and embarking on the journey. Along the way, they encouraged themselves with the heroic spirit of "The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of the Long March," marching in the rain, crossing the Yellow River against the wind, sleeping in haystacks at night, and cooking in salty fields. Their shoulders were swollen, and their feet were blistered, but they gritted their teeth and walked over a thousand one hundred miles in eight days. Along the way, they studied Chairman Mao's works, propagated Mao Zedong Thought, and used the money they earned from labor to buy over a thousand copies of Chairman Mao's single-volume works, giving them to the poor and lower-middle peasants along the way. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, widely contacted the masses, and learned the experiences of class struggle and production struggle from the poor and lower-middle peasants wherever they went; wherever they stayed, they helped the masses cut hair, carry water, and sweep the courtyard, receiving enthusiastic praise from the people along the way.

On the journey, three female students in the team used their rest time to sew a banner with the words "Long March Red Guards" on it. This is a red flag symbolizing revolution and victory. Today, they came to accept the inspection of the great leader with this red flag. To express their determination to forever inherit the revolutionary tradition of the Long March and follow the great leader to do revolution for life, they presented this red flag to Chairman Mao.

On the viewing platform, there was also a team of eleven youngsters from Bengbu Railway Middle School in Anhui, forming the "Long March Propaganda Team of Mao Zedong Thought." In forty-four days, they walked over two thousand miles. Along the way, they used performances and other forms to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Whether it was at stations, fields, offices, or schools, as long as there were people watching, they performed seriously, performing up to eight shows a day, averaging three shows a day. They said: "Even if there is one person watching, we will perform. The more people who grasp Mao Zedong Thought, the more strength we add for the revolution."

Walking and connecting, this is a new thing that has just emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Young people go to the masses, to society, absorb endless nourishment, further understand Mao Zedong Thought, and understand Chairman Mao's correct line.

Today, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, from morning to evening, continuously for more than seven hours, received revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards. This is the sixth reception since August 18, including National Day, and also the largest-scale reception. Looking across the country, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is even more deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the revolutionary tide of the masses is surging forward, rolling on. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance along Chairman Mao's correct line, and the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely achieve thorough victory!

    毛主席的路线胜利万岁！
    见到毛主席最幸福
    世界上什么最红？
    天安门上的太阳最红。
    世界上什么人最亲？
    毛主席最亲。
    世界上什么最幸福？
    见到毛主席最幸福。
    我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，在无产阶级革命路线取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，十一月三日第六次接见了来自全国各地的革命师生和红卫兵。
    十点十分，一曲《东方红》激动着万千人的心弦，激动着全国亿万人民的心。我们最亲近的人、最敬爱的人——毛主席身穿草绿色军装，容光焕发地和他亲密的战友林彪同志，以及中央其他负责同志，来到天安门上。千万颗激动的心一齐飞向毛主席，千万双高举《毛主席语录》的手一齐伸向毛主席，千万双含着喜悦泪花的眼睛一齐仰望着毛主席，千万人高呼着一个共同的声音：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    在沸腾的人山人海中，有上海的红卫兵，有湖南的革命师生，有遵义的革命小将，有延安的革命后代。上海，是党的第一次代表大会召开的地方。从党的第一次代表大会以来，毛主席一直代表党的正确路线。湖南，是毛主席到群众中去，发动农民运动最早的地方。毛主席的正确路线在同各种错误路线斗争中取得一次又一次的胜利。遵义，是具有伟大历史意义的遵义会议召开的地方。在遵义会议上确立了毛主席在全党的领导地位。延安，是光芒四照的革命圣地。毛主席在延安领导全国人民取得了中国革命的辉煌胜利。历史经验证明，执行毛主席路线就是胜利。无产阶级文化大革命的经验也证明，只有执行毛主席的路线，才能把文化大革命进行到底。这些从毛主席留下光辉史迹的地方来到北京，来到毛主席身旁的革命师生，今天看到了毛主席，怀着无限的激情，欢呼毛主席正确路线的胜利，决心永远遵循毛主席的正确路线前进。
    来自西北大学的一位红卫兵，呼喊“毛主席万岁”的声音特别响亮。他出生在革命圣地延安。他说：“毛主席在延安住过的杨家岭、枣园，我一千次、一万次地看见过；毛主席在延安种过的菜园，我在那里劳动过。可是，我一次也没有亲眼见过毛主席，我日夜想念他老人家啊！今天，我终于见到了心中最红最红的太阳，我要把这最幸福的日子永远铭刻在心，变成推动自己永远前进的动力。”
    毛主席走到天安门城楼东边来，手持军帽，向革命群众致意。
    东边观礼台上的群众沸腾了。一位身穿粉红色绸袍的蒙古族红卫兵小将，久久仰望着毛主席，不住地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    许多人请这位蒙古族小将在自己的《毛主席语录》本上签名，她总是先用蒙古文恭恭敬敬地写上“毛主席万岁”，然后用汉文签上自己的名字：“龙梅”。
    龙梅，多么熟悉的名字！人们想起了两年多前草原英雄小姐妹的动人事迹。那时，龙梅还只有十一岁，她和七岁的妹妹玉荣一起，在一个暴风雪的夜晚，冒着严寒，英勇地与风雪搏斗了一天一夜，保护了公社的羊群。
    是毛主席“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，鼓舞着她们完成了这样的英雄业绩。多年来，她们一直想念着毛主席，日夜盼望见到毛主席。此刻，龙梅见到了毛主席。她激动地说：“我看见了，毛主席身体好极了。这是我们各族人民的最大幸福。我一定好好学习毛主席著作，做红色的接班人！”
    西安四中一个同学，个子矮，离得又远，看不清楚，急得哭了。同学们把她高举过头，一节一节递到金水桥前。一位解放军战士把她接过来，高高举起，让她清清楚楚地看到了毛主席，这时她幸福地笑了。
    在这令人难忘的时刻里，三个来自上海盲人中学的学生，在观礼台上高举着《毛主席语录》盲文本，向天安门城楼欢呼。他们面向着毛主席，感到一轮红日在胸中冉冉升起，眼前射来万道红光，毛主席神采奕奕微笑着向自己身边走来了。旁边的红卫兵告诉他们：“毛主席看到你们了。”他们说：“我们像明人一样来到北京，像战士一样来到毛主席身边。毛主席看到我们，我们也看到了毛主席。”
    最光辉的榜样
    大会开始，毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志在热烈的掌声中讲话。
    林彪同志说：“党的八届十一中全会，宣告了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产。两个多月来，毛主席的正确路线同广大群众见面，为广大群众所掌握，展开了对错误路线的批判。毛主席号召大家关心国家大事，真正变成了广大群众的行动。这是极大的好事。这是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的重要保证。”林彪同志的话音一落，全场就爆发了热烈的欢呼。
    来自斗争最前线的革命师生，特别是那些受过资产阶级反动路线压制的革命闯将们，他们深切地体会到：是毛主席的革命路线支持了他们，是毛主席的革命路线解放了他们。毛主席的革命路线是同广大群众心连心的路线！
    两个多月来，革命闯将们都亲身参加了群众性的对错误路线的批判。他们深切地体会到：资产阶级反动路线不过是纸老虎，只要乘胜追击，就可以把它打垮。毛主席的革命路线是战无不胜的路线！
    革命小将们怀着对毛主席、对毛主席的革命路线的深厚爱戴之情，不断地欢呼这条金光闪闪的革命路线的伟大胜利！
    来自兰州的一队红卫兵，随着沸腾澎湃的革命洪流通过天安门广场，经过毛主席面前的时候，他们把学了千百遍的《毛主席语录》高高地举过头顶，热泪盈眶地一遍一遍高呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    这支队伍曾经受到资产阶级反动路线的压制。在那艰苦斗争的日子里，每当旭日东升，他们迎着朝阳，遥望北京，向毛主席表示决心：“毛主席啊毛主席，为了捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，上刀山，下火海，我们在所不辞！”每当夜幕降临，他们望着北斗星，想着天安门，思念着伟大领袖：“毛主席啊毛主席，我们多想见到您！您老人家知道了这里的情况，一定会给我们最大的支持！”
    是的，在那艰苦斗争的日子里，是毛主席支持了他们。每当他们翻开《毛主席语录》，读到：“黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头”，他们眼前便出现了万丈霞光；每当念到：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，他们就浑身是劲。毛主席对无产阶级文化大革命的每一次指示，都给了他们极大的鼓舞和力量。
    现在，他们来到了伟大领袖身边，走在伟大领袖面前，他们兴奋，激动，千言万语涌上心头。不少人走出天安门广场，就在日记本上写下共同的决心：坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    在游行队伍当中，有两个外地来的“毛泽东思想红卫兵”的战士。他们一走出天安门广场，就赶到电报大楼，向他们的红卫兵总部拍发电报，报告见到了伟大领袖毛主席，报告毛主席和林彪同志的身体非常健康，让战友们共享这最大的幸福。
    当他们酝酿揭发学校的党内走资本主义道路当权派的时候，毛主席支持的聂元梓等七同志的第一张革命的大字报，给他们壮了胆。一把火，把全校的革命烈火点了起来。
    当他们闹革命受到某些人的非议、阻难，甚至有的人被打成“右派”的时候，毛主席主持制定的十六条，给了他们革命造反的最锐利的武器，搬开了运动的绊脚石。
    当他们着手组织红卫兵，某些人攻击他们是“闹小集团”、“搞地下活动”的时候，毛主席八月十八日在天安门接见了红卫兵，戴上了红袖章，极力支持这一在地平线上出现的新生事物。过了四天，他们的代表便赶到天安门广场，在毛主席像前宣誓，堂堂正正地成立了自己的红卫兵组织。
    这两位革命闯将激动地说：我们的处境，我们的要求，毛主席总是知道得清清楚楚，他老人家就像经常在我们身边一样！
    从南海之滨到天山南北，从黑龙江畔到康藏高原，来自祖国四方的革命小将们，都怀着无比激动的心情说：我们的伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最放手发动群众。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席最坚决地支持了革命群众的首创精神。
    他们说：林彪同志今天说出了我们表达不出的共同心意：“毛主席是最伟大的无产阶级革命家，他总是同群众在一起，充分地信任群众，和群众同呼吸，共命运，全心全意支持革命的群众运动。毛主席给全党同志，给青年一代，树立了最光辉的榜样。”毛主席啊毛主席，我们青年一代一定要永远向您学习，学习，再学习。我们希望老一辈的革命者也都认真地向我们伟大领袖学习，学习，再学习！
    大民主好得很
    天安门广场上，由革命师生和红卫兵组成的无产阶级文化革命大军，有如一条波澜壮阔的红色长河，浩浩荡荡地向前挺进。我国历史上一代“敢”字当头的新人，有毛主席作最高统帅，有解放军作光辉榜样，他们天不怕，地不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，正以其美妙之青春磅礴于世界。
    那些怕革命怕群众的人不是说他们狂妄吗？红卫兵战士坚定地回答：我们就是“狂妄”！“指点江山，激扬文字，粪土当年万户侯。”
    有些人不是说他们野心太大吗？革命小将们坚定地回答：我们的“野心”就是大！“为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。”
    “真是无法无天啊！”看不惯革命行为的人这样议论。红卫兵战士斩钉截铁地回答：我们就是“无法无天”，我们“要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌”！
    我们的革命小将和广大革命群众以天下为己任，在毛主席正确路线的指引下，创造了无产阶级专政下发展大民主的新经验。这种大民主，就是党无所畏惧地让广大群众运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连的形式，批评和监督党和国家各级领导机关和各级领导人。
    几个月来的无产阶级文化大革命运动，充分地证明了：有了这种大民主，就可以真正地发动群众，就可以触及人们的灵魂深处，就可以在修正主义的毒苗一露头就把它铲掉。一位来自河南的红卫兵说得好：“大民主对于敌人来讲，是不拿枪的人民战争，牛鬼蛇神一个也漏不掉，一个也跑不了。大民主对于群众来讲，是不上课的革命学校，每个人都可以受到教育，得到锻炼。”
    一位来自哈尔滨的红卫兵，介绍了他们是如何运用大民主揪出反党分子的。七月中旬，群众摸了那些走资本主义道路当权派的老虎屁股，他们就跳起来了，诬蔑是“反党”。这时，是伟大领袖毛主席的“造反有理”的名言鼓舞了大家。大字报，你一张，我一张，像排炮一样地对准目标开火；大辩论，你一句，我一句，驳得他们哑口无言；大串连，你走东，我走西，集中革命群众的智慧，把运动推向更高的高潮，使牛鬼蛇神的丑恶面貌暴露在光天化日之下。
    大民主，是毛泽东思想同广大群众相结合的新形式，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的新贡献。广大革命师生在天安门前高呼：大民主好得好！
    沿着毛主席的路线前进
    下午四时半，毛主席穿上草绿色的军大衣，在天安门上向群众招手致意。
    在东观礼台上，有一队徒步来京的革命师生，高举红色语录本，向着毛主席尽情欢呼。他们是山东临淄县敬仲农业中学的“长征赤卫队”。十三名队员平均年龄不到十八岁。
    八天以前，他们怀着对伟大领袖的无限热爱，背起一二十斤重的背包，自己用车拉着行军锅灶和够吃一个来月的粮食，踏上征途。一路上，他们用“红军不怕远征难”的英雄气概激励自己，冒着大雨急行军，顶着狂风过黄河，在草垛旁打盹过夜，在盐碱地里支锅做饭。肩压肿了，脚磨破了，还是咬紧牙关，在八天之内走了一千一百多里。他们一路学习毛主席著作，一路宣传毛泽东思想，用自己勤工俭学得来的钱买了一千二百多本毛主席著作单行本，送给沿途的贫下中农。他们遵循毛主席的教导，广泛接触群众，接触社会，走到哪里，就向哪里的贫下中农学习阶级斗争和生产斗争的经验；住到哪里，就帮助哪里的群众理发、挑水、扫院子，受到沿途群众的热烈赞扬。
    在征途上，这支队伍中的三位女同学，利用休息时间，一针一线地缝做了一面写着“长征赤卫队”几个大字的队旗。这是一面象征着革命和胜利的红旗。今天他们就是打着这面红旗来接受伟大领袖检阅的。为了表示要永远继承红军长征的革命传统，跟着伟大领袖干一辈子革命的坚强决心，他们把这面红旗献给了毛主席。
    在观礼台上，还有安徽蚌埠铁路中学十一名小将组成的“毛泽东思想长征宣传队”。他们在四十四天的时间里，走了两千多里。一路上，他们以文艺演出等形式，宣传毛泽东思想。不论是车站、田头、机关、学校，只要有人看，他们就认真地演，最多一天演八场，平均每天演三场。他们说：“有一个人看也要演，多一个人掌握毛泽东思想，就为革命多增加一分力量。”
    步行串连，这是无产阶级文化大革命中刚刚露头的新事物。年轻人到群众中去，到社会里去，吸取无穷无尽的养料，进一步领会毛泽东思想，领会毛主席的正确路线。
    今天，我们的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，从上午到傍晚，持续七个多小时接见革命师生和红卫兵。这是从八月十八日以来，连同国庆节在内的第六次接见，也是规模最大的一次接见。放眼全国，无产阶级文化大革命的形势大好，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，群众的革命浪潮正在方兴未艾，滚滚向前。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席的正确路线前进，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命一定能取得彻底胜利！　本报记者
