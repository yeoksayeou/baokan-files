The Vietnam Committee for the Investigation of U.S. War Crimes held a press conference for domestic and foreign journalists in Hanoi on November 31 and issued a statement severely condemning the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. war in Vietnam is the most savage and brutal war of aggression in history. It has mobilized the entire modern warfare machinery of the most powerful economic and military potential in the imperialist camp against a nation determined to fight to the end to defend its sacred national rights.

The statement said that to subjugate the Vietnamese people, U.S. imperialism has resorted to the most inhuman means of warfare. It has used artillery, air force, and navy to conduct massive bombardments in various places; it has used napalm, phosphorus bombs, cluster bombs, and various chemical poisons and gases. It has collectively tortured and killed people, regardless of whether they are old, women, or children; it has tortured and tortured captured liberation army soldiers and innocent civilians. It has destroyed villages, towns, cities, and a series of public welfare projects; it has destroyed crops, dikes, and water conservancy projects, attempting to make millions of people suffer from hunger and cold. U.S. imperialism is so savage and brutal that it uses the Vietnamese battlefield as a testing ground for its military strategies, tactics, and various modern killing weapons.

The statement emphasized that the above-mentioned crimes of the war-mongering and inhuman U.S. imperialism, in terms of their severity, savagery, and brutality, far surpass the crimes of the Hitler clique. Because of the crimes of aggression, anti-peace, and anti-humanity, the U.S. government has committed the greatest international crime.

The statement said that as the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has pointed out, U.S. imperialism is the greatest war criminal of the contemporary world. It is not only the direct and eternal enemy of the Vietnamese nation but also the most dangerous enemy of all peoples of the world.

The statement said that the Vietnamese nation has a tradition of courageous and unyielding struggle against foreign aggression and for the defense of the independence, freedom, and unity of the motherland. At present, facing the savage aggression of U.S. imperialism, which is threatening the survival of the nation, and facing the extremely dangerous plot of U.S. imperialism to continue to clamor for "peace talks" while intensifying the preparation for strengthening and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, the entire Vietnamese people, from south to north, are determined to fight to the end to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggression and enslavement and to defend their right to live independently and freely. The current task is to defeat the enemy's impending dry-season strategic counteroffensive. The Vietnamese people, united as one, will use all their spiritual and material strength to realize the call of Chairman Hu: "To defend the independence of the motherland, to fulfill the obligation to the peoples who are fighting against U.S. imperialism, our entire people and army will unite as one, endure hardships and sacrifices, and fight resolutely to final victory."

The statement finally called on all peace-loving and justice-seeking peoples of the world to more strongly condemn the U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam and to resolutely and thoroughly support the just stance of the Vietnamese people.

The statement demands that U.S. imperialism must stop its war of aggression against Vietnam, stop bombing and other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, must withdraw all U.S. military bases, and withdraw all U.S. and its puppet troops and weapons from South Vietnam, allowing the Vietnamese people to decide their own fate.

    严厉谴责美帝在越南犯下的滔天罪行

    新华社河内三十一日电　越南民主共和国调查美帝国主义在越南的战争罪行委员会三十一日在这里举行的国内外记者招待会上发表一项声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义在越南犯下的滔天罪行。
    声明指出，美国在越南的战争是历史上最野蛮、最残暴的侵略战争，它开动了帝国主义阵营中有着最强大的经济潜力和军事潜力的国家的整个现代化战争机器，反对一个为了保卫自己神圣的民族权利而决心战斗到底的民族。
    声明说，为了使越南人民屈服，美帝国主义不惜采取了极其灭绝人性的战争工具和战争手段。它用炮兵、空军、海军大规模地在各地进行狂轰滥炸；它使用了凝固汽油弹、磷质弹、珠型炸弹和各种化学毒剂和毒气等。它集体虐待和残杀人民，不管他们是老人、妇女还是小孩；它折磨和拷打被它抓到的解放军战士和无辜人民。它摧毁了村庄、市镇、城市和一系列公共福利工程；它毁坏了庄稼、堤坝和水利工程，企图使成千百万人过着饥寒交迫的生活。美帝国主义是如此野蛮残暴，以至用越南战场作为它的军事战略、战术和各种现代化杀人武器的试验场所。
    声明强调指出，好战的和丧失人性的美帝国主义的上述罪行，从其严重程度、野蛮和残暴程度来看，都远远超过了希特勒魔群的罪行。由于所犯的是侵略、反和平和反人类之罪，美国政府已犯了最大的国际罪。
    声明说，正如越南南方民族解放阵线所指出的，美帝国主义是当代最大的战争罪犯。它不仅是越南民族直接的世世代代的敌人，而且也是全世界各民族的最危险的敌人。
    声明说，越南民族有着反对外来侵略，捍卫祖国的独立、自由和统一的英勇不屈的斗争传统。目前，面对着美帝国主义进行的、正威胁着民族存亡的残暴侵略，面对着美帝国主义一面继续叫嚷“和平谈判”，一方面加紧准备强化和扩大侵略越南战争的这一极其危险的阴谋，全体越南人民，从南到北，决心为打败美帝国主义的侵略和奴役，为捍卫自己独立和自由地生活的权利而战斗到底，而当前则是打败敌人即将进行的旱季战略反攻。越南人民万众一心，将用自己的全部精神力量和物质力量来实现胡主席的号召：“为了保卫祖国的独立，为了履行对正在反对美帝国主义的各个民族所承担的义务，我国全民和全军团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。”
    声明最后呼吁全世界爱好和平和主持正义的各国人民，更加强烈地谴责美帝国主义对越南的侵略罪行，坚决和彻底地支持越南人民正义的立场。
    声明要求美帝国主义必须停止对越南的侵略战争，停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他战争行动，必须撤除美国的全部军事基地，将美国及其仆从国的军队和武器全部撤出越南南方，让越南人民自行决定自己的命运。
