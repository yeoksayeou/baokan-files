Red Guards, you are full of spirit,
Marching thousands of miles on foot,
Unafraid of high mountains and treacherous paths,
Every red heart unwavering in its resolve.
Wherever you march, you spread propaganda,
Planting the seeds of Mao Zedong Thought in people's hearts.
Wherever you march, you study,
Learning from the workers and peasants,
United closely with the masses.
Arm yourselves with Mao Zedong Thought,
This is your greatest fighting strength.
The Little Red Book never leaves your side,
Study, study, and study some more!
See the world, face the storms,
Endure a thousand hardships and ten thousand trials,
Never forget class struggle,
Carry the revolution through to the end!
Red Guards, you are full of spirit,
Marching thousands of miles on foot,
Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought,
Be a red seed-sower!

    要做红色播种机
    陈涛红卫兵呀有志气，步行长征千百里，不畏山高和路险，颗颗红心志不移。行军到那里，宣传到那里，把毛泽东思想的种子，传播在人们的心里。行军到那里，学习到那里，向工农大众求教，和群众紧密连在一起。用毛泽东思想武装自己，这就是最大的战斗力，《毛主席语录》不离身，学习学习再学习！见世面，经风雨，千磨百炼经得起，阶级斗争永不忘，把革命进行到底！红卫兵呀有志气，步行长征千百里，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，要做红色播种机！
