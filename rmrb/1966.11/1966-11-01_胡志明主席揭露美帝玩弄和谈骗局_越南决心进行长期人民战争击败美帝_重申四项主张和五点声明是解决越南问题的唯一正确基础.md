Newspaper reports that Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently stated in an interview with the editor-in-chief of the French magazine "L'Express," Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie, that the Vietnamese people are prepared to confront the American imperialists and are determined to continue the fight, even if it takes five, ten, or more years.

He emphasized, "To defeat such an enemy, we first rely on our own strength and strive to obtain the most effective international aid."

He said, "Volunteers from socialist countries and other countries have already declared their readiness to fight alongside us against American imperialism. We are deeply grateful for their support in our struggle. When necessary, we will call upon them."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh exposed the "peace talks" deception of American imperialism, saying, "Every time the Americans escalate the war, they propagandize about so-called 'peace talks.' This is just a smokescreen." He said, "However, some well-meaning people deceived by American propaganda advise us to negotiate with the aggressors at any cost. They forget that to end this war, all that is needed is for the Americans to guarantee their withdrawal. For them, this is the only honorable solution."

He then pointed out that Vietnam's position is clear: the "Four Points" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the "Five Points" of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. This is the only correct basis for resolving the Vietnamese issue.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh also mentioned in his response to the editor-in-chief of "L'Express" that despite the United States sending large numbers of troops to South Vietnam, "the American expeditionary forces suffered heavy defeats in the 1965-1966 dry season campaign. In six months, the United States and its puppets in Saigon suffered 114,000 casualties without being able to regain the initiative. The so-called 'Saigon government' cannot even exercise power in the cities. Its army has suffered severe losses due to mass desertions and frequent mutinies." He said, "On the contrary, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is increasingly proving to be the only true representative of the people of South Vietnam."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said, "The attacks by the U.S. Air Force have been met with stronger counterattacks. We have already shot down 1,350 attacking aircraft (this figure was recorded at the time of the interview; now it has increased to 1,521—VNA note). Naturally, we have also suffered some losses. But we have adapted our economy to the current situation." He said, "In 1965, rice production continued to increase. Many agricultural cooperatives, including those in the areas most heavily bombed by the enemy, produced five tons of rice per hectare per year. We have also developed local industries. Transportation and logistics continue to operate, and living expenses have not risen." He said, "Despite daily air raids, three million primary school students continue to attend school. The number of students enrolling in universities and colleges has reached one hundred thousand." He said, "These situations show how united our people are in their love for the motherland and their determination to sacrifice everything to defeat the enemy."

He stressed, "Mobilizing the entire nation to wage a long-term people's war against American aggression, educating the masses in patriotism and collective heroism, and launching a widespread patriotic competition under the slogan 'Everything for Victory,' these are the experiences we have gained in our current struggle for national independence."

    胡志明主席揭露美帝玩弄和谈骗局
    越南决心进行长期人民战争击败美帝
    重申四项主张和五点声明是解决越南问题的唯一正确基础
    新华社河内三十一日电　据越南通讯社三十日报道，越南民主共和国主席胡志明最近在接见法国《事件》杂志总编辑埃马尼埃·达斯迪埃—德拉维热里时重申，越南人民已经作好对付美帝国主义者的准备，“决心继续打下去，即使要打上五年、十年或者更长的时间。”
    他强调说：“为了击败这样的敌人，我们首先依靠我们自己的力量，同时努力争取最有效的国际援助。”
    他说：“社会主义国家和其他国家的成千成万的志愿人员已经宣布他们准备和我们一起同美帝国主义者作战。我们热烈感谢他们对我们的战斗支援。在必要时，我们将向他们发出呼吁。”
    胡主席在谈话中揭露了美帝国主义所玩弄的“和谈”骗局。他说：“美国人每使战争加紧一步，就大肆宣传一通所谓‘和谈’。这只是一种烟幕。”他说：“然而，一些受美国宣传的欺骗的好心的人们却劝我们不惜一切代价来同侵略者进行谈判。他们忘记了，要结束这场战争，只需要美国保证撤退就行了。对于他们来说，这是唯一体面的解决办法。”
    他接着指出，越南的立场是清楚的，那就是越南民主共和国的“四项主张”和越南南方民族解放阵线的“五点声明”。这是解决越南问题的唯一正确基础。
    胡志明主席在答法国《事件》杂志总编辑问时还谈到：尽管美国向越南南方增派大批部队，“美国远征军在一九六五——一九六六年旱季战役中仍然遭到了惨重的失败。在六个月内，美国及其在西贡的代理人伤亡了十一万四千人，而没有能够夺回主动权。所谓的‘西贡政府’甚至在城市里也不能行使权力。它的军队由于大批逃亡和经常发生哗变而受到严重损失。”他说：“与此相反，越南南方民族解放阵线愈来愈证明它自己是越南南方人民的唯一真正代表。”
    胡志明主席说：“美国空军的攻击受到了更有力的反击。已经打下了一千三百五十架攻击机（这个数字是接见记者时的记录，现在已经增加到一千五百二十一架——越通社编者注）。自然我们也遭到一些损失。但是我们已使我们的经济适应目前的形势。”他说：“在一九六五年，大米产量继续增长，许多农业合作社包括那些被敌人轰炸得最厉害的地区的合作社，每公顷稻田一年收五吨稻米。我们还发展了地方工业。交通和运输继续运行，生活费用并没有上涨。”他说：“尽管每天都有空袭，三百万小学生继续到学校学习。大学和专科学校入学的学生达十万人。”他说：“这些情况说明，我国人民是何等团结一致地热爱祖国，并决心不顾一切牺牲，击败敌人。”
    他强调说：“动员全国对美国侵略者进行长期的人民战争，对广大群众进行爱国主义和集体英雄主义的教育，并在‘一切为了胜利’的口号下掀起广泛的爱国竞赛运动，这就是我们在目前争取民族独立的斗争中得到的经验。”
