I love reading Chairman Mao's works. To liberate and make our country independent, I want to return home to fight. For this, I have studied Chairman Mao Zedong's articles on warfare, which have given me great inspiration. I believe that our struggle will definitely be victorious, because Chairman Mao has said that a just war will definitely be victorious. Our country is not yet liberated and is very poor, but it will definitely change in the future. Because Chairman Mao has said, "Being poor and blank is a good thing." Being poor makes one think of change, and one must act and make a revolution. A blank sheet of paper has no burden, and on it, one can write the newest and most beautiful words and draw the newest and most beautiful pictures. Therefore, I love Chairman Mao's works very much.

    我最喜欢读毛主席的著作
    为了我们祖国得到解放和独立，我要打回老家去。为此，我学习了毛泽东主席关于论述战争方面的文章，给我启发很大。我相信，我们的斗争一定能胜利，因为毛主席说过，正义战争一定能胜利。我国现在没有得到解放，很穷，但是将来一定会改变的。因为毛主席说过，“一穷二白”是好事，穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的图画。所以我很喜欢毛主席著作。
