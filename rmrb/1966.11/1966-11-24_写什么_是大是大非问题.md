	"What to Write" is a Matter of Principle
	Li Xiaoshu, Zhang Xingliang, Su Shuzhen, Zhao Zhengsheng
	Naval Unit

	Zhou Yang fervently advocates for "artistic freedom," urging his followers to "write about topics they are familiar with," claiming that what writers write is a "secondary issue." He even slanders the Party's encouragement for writers to tackle significant socialist themes as "meddling," likening it to a "party secretary telling a doctor how to operate," which will "kill the patient." Zhou Yang wishes to overturn the Party's leadership to allow these reactionaries to engage in "creative freedom" and "free competition," writing whatever they please.

	Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." A writer's stance and their motivation to serve whom will determine the themes they choose. The question of for whom and what to write are two sides of the same issue.

	Does Zhou Yang genuinely believe that "what to write is a secondary issue"? No! He knows full well the importance of this matter. Therefore, he harbors such deep resentment towards significant socialist themes and fervently promotes themes like "love affairs, household matters," and romantic topics. He harshly criticizes works that praise the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, labeling them with a "second-rate" rating. He enthusiastically praises works that glorify landlords and the bourgeoisie, shouting their praises. He is not treating the theme as a "secondary issue" at all! We must not forget that Zhou Yang and his gang have been actively discussing theme issues, giving speeches, and writing articles. If, as they say, "what to write" is merely an insignificant issue, would they have the leisure to discuss these "secondary" matters?

	What to write, whom to praise, whom to oppose, which class stance to take, and for which class to speak are all matters of principle. The Party must manage this! The hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers must manage this! If we do not, and allow Zhou Yang and his gang to freely write, draw, perform, and sing, freely spreading feudalistic, bourgeois, and modern revisionist ideas, then our Party and our country will change color. This is absolutely unacceptable! This is absolutely unthinkable!

### “写什么”是大是大非问题

    “写什么”是大是大非问题
    海军某部  李孝树　张兴良  宿淑箴　赵振生
    周扬竭力鼓吹文艺“自由”，号召他的娄罗们“写自己熟悉的题材”，说作家“写什么，是次要的问题”，甚至污蔑党提倡作家写社会主义重大题材是“指手划脚”，就像在“医生开刀”的时候，“党委书记在旁边告诉这样开，那样开”一样，“非把人开死不可”。周扬恨不能一下子把党的领导反掉，好让他们这些反动的家伙搞“创作自由”“自由竞赛”，想写什么就写什么。
    毛主席早就指出：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”一个作者，站在什么立场，有一个为什么人服务的动机，就会去选择什么题材。为什么人和写什么作品，这是一个问题的两个方面。
    周扬当真认为“写什么，是次要的问题”吗？不！他深知写什么极为重要，所以对社会主义的重大题材才那么切齿痛恨，对“儿女情、家务事”，风花雪月的题材才那么拚命提倡；对歌颂工农兵斗争生活的作品才那么横加指责，打上“二分”，对歌颂地主资产阶级的作品才那么津津乐道，大声叫好。他哪是认为题材问题只是一个“次要问题”呢！我们不能忘记，周扬一伙在题材问题上，作报告，写文章，一直积极得很，“辛苦”得很。如果按照他们的说法，“写什么”只是一个无足轻重的问题的话，他们会有那么高的“闲情逸致”来谈论这些“次要问题”吗？
    写什么，歌颂谁，反对谁，站在哪个阶级立场上，为哪个阶级说话，这是个大是大非的问题，我们党一定要管！我们亿万工农兵群众一定要管！如果不管，让周扬一伙“自由”地写、画、演、唱，“自由”地传播封建主义的货色，“自由”地传播资产阶级的东西，“自由”地传播现代修正主义的那一套，那末我们的党，我们的国家就要变颜色。这万万不允许！万万办不到！
