Inspired by the spirit of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, the broad masses of workers and peasants in Albania are full of enthusiasm and are achieving one victory after another in the fields of industry and agriculture.

In recent days, the spirit of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour has been conveyed and discussed throughout the country, and a wave of studying the documents of the Fifth Congress has swept across the nation. The broad masses of Party members and workers enthusiastically endorse and fully support the profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the international and domestic situation made by the Fifth Congress, and are confidently striving to implement the fighting program proposed by the Congress.

On the industrial front, the broad masses of workers, inspired and mobilized by the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, have pushed the socialist labor competition to new heights and achieved new successes in production. In the Durres region, eleven industrial enterprises had already completed their production tasks for the first year of the fourth five-year plan (1966-1970) by mid-November. The workers of the Durres Port Mechanical Repair Factory have carried out extensive technical innovations, producing many new products. Currently, the factory can produce all the components of cranes and manufacture a large number of handcarts to replace short-distance truck transportation, saving the state a considerable amount of funds.

The workers of the Enver Hoxha Textile Combine in Berat have completed 30% more than the planned production for November in the first half of the month. All the workers in the factory, during the study and discussion of the documents of the Fifth Congress, unanimously pledged to complete the 1967 production tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfill them. The "Sickle and Hammer" Knitting Factory in Korca had produced 4,000 more knitted items by November 15. The workers plan to produce 114,000 more knitted items and 13 tons of sewing thread over the plan by the end of this year. The miners in the Rubik Copper Mine in Mat have greatly accelerated the mining speed, completing one and a half days' quota every day. The workers of the tractor station in Shkodra, during the study and discussion of the documents of the Fifth Congress, unanimously decided to complete the tasks of the fourth five-year plan in four years.

Inspired by the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, the revolutionary enthusiasm and labor ardor of the workers in the state farms and members of agricultural production cooperatives in Albania have further surged. They are bravely fighting against nature to achieve self-sufficiency in grain. Since November, it has been raining continuously in various parts of Albania, and some places have suffered disasters due to heavy rain. However, the agricultural workers, armed with the spirit of the Party Congress, have bravely overcome various difficulties. This year's autumn harvest and sowing were faster and better than in previous years, and the autumn harvest has now basically been completed. The grain yield has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. By November 15, the autumn sowing task for the whole country had been completed by 80%, and the sowing speed was much faster than in previous years.

Many individual farmers in various regions, inspired by the Fifth Congress, have further raised their socialist consciousness and actively joined agricultural production cooperatives. In a short period, many mountainous areas with a lower degree of cooperativization, such as Berat and Skrapar, have seen the vast majority of individual farmers who had not yet joined cooperatives actively joining agricultural production cooperatives, further consolidating and developing the collective economy.

    在劳动党“五大”精神的鼓舞下广大劳动人民干劲十足
    阿尔巴尼亚工农业战线一派大好形势
    许多企业提前完成今年生产任务　粮食收成比去年同期大幅度增加
    新华社地拉那二十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚广大劳动人民在劳动党第五次代表大会的鼓舞下，正干劲十足地在工农业生产战线上夺取一个又一个的胜利。
    最近以来，全国各地都传达和讨论了劳动党第五次代表大会的精神，并且掀起了一个学习第五次代表大会文件的热潮。广大党员和劳动人民热烈赞同和完全拥护第五次代表大会对国际国内形势所做的深刻的马克思列宁主义分析，并信心百倍地为实现代表大会所提出的战斗纲领而奋斗。
    工业战线上的广大职工，在劳动党第五次代表大会的鼓舞和动员下，把社会主义劳动竞赛进一步推向了新高潮，在生产中不断取得新的成就。都拉斯区有十一个工业企业在十一月中旬就已经完成了今年——第四个五年计划
  （一九六六——一九七○年）第一年——的生产任务。都拉斯海港机械修理厂的职工，大搞技术革新，生产出许多新产品，目前这个厂已经能够自己生产起重机的全部零件，并且能制造大量手推车，代替短程汽车运输，为国家节约大量资金。
    培拉特毛泽东纺织联合工厂的职工，在十一月上半月就超额百分之三十完成了今年十一月份生产计划。全厂职工在学习和讨论第五次代表大会文件时，一致保证要提前和超额完成一九六七年的生产任务。科尔察区“镰刀与锤子”针织厂，到十一月十五日已经超额生产了四千件针织品。职工们计划到今年年底前超计划生产十一万四千件针织品，十三吨缝纫线。米尔迪塔区卢比克铜矿的矿工也大大加快了采矿速度，他们最近每天都完成一天半的定额。斯库台区拖拉机站的职工在学习和讨论第五次代表大会的文件时一致决定，用四年的时间，完成第四个五年计划。
    在劳动党第五次代表大会的鼓舞下，阿尔巴尼亚国营农场工人和农业生产合作社社员的革命干劲和劳动热情更加高涨，他们为争取粮食自给，向大自然展开了英勇的战斗。十一月份以来，阿尔巴尼亚全国各地不断下雨，有的地方因下雨过多造成灾害。但是用党代表大会精神武装起来的农业劳动者，勇敢地克服了各种困难。今年全国的秋收秋种比往年又快又好，目前秋收已经基本结束。粮食的收成比去年同期有大幅度增加。到十一月十五日，全国秋种任务已经完成了百分之八十，秋种速度大大超过往年。
    许多区的个体农民，在第五次代表大会的鼓舞下，社会主义觉悟进一步提高，积极踊跃地参加农业生产合作社。在短短的时间内，一些合作化程度较低的山区如贝尔梅特、斯克拉巴里等区尚未入社的个体农民，绝大部分都加入了农业生产合作社，使集体经济得到了进一步巩固和发展。
