Today marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

On the 90th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, our great leader Chairman Mao wrote the famous article "In Memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen," giving a lofty evaluation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary and fighting life. Chairman Mao said:

"In memory of the great revolutionary forerunner Dr. Sun Yat-sen!

In memory of his clear-cut stance as a Chinese revolutionary democrat during the preparatory period of the Chinese democratic revolution, in sharp struggle with the Chinese reformists. He was the banner of the Chinese revolutionary democrats in this struggle.

In memory of his great achievements in leading the people to overthrow the monarchy and establish the republic during the Xinhai Revolution.

In memory of his great achievements in developing the old Three Principles of the People into the new Three Principles of the People during the period of the First United Front between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

He has left us many beneficial things in the field of political thought.

All modern Chinese, except for a handful of reactionaries, are the successors of Dr. Sun's revolutionary cause."

During the preparatory period of the Chinese democratic revolution, there were two lines of struggle: one represented by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the revolutionary democrats, and the other by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, the reformists.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen, from the standpoint of the revolutionary democrats, advocated the use of revolutionary means to overthrow the Qing government and establish a democratic republic. Kang Youwei, on the other hand, from the standpoint of the reformists, advocated not touching the fundamental interests of the Qing emperor's rule, opposed revolution, and sabotaged the revolution. Under the leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the revolutionaries engaged in a great debate with the reformists, preparing the ideological ground for the Xinhai Revolution.

The Xinhai Revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen had great historical significance. This revolution did not complete the task of the democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism, but it ended more than two thousand years of feudal imperial rule in China and promoted the rise of democratic spirit. The Chinese people will forever remember Dr. Sun Yat-sen's role in this revolution.

In the ten years following the Xinhai Revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen went through a long period of disappointment, anguish, and exploration. The fruits of the Xinhai Revolution were seized by the clique of big landlords and compradors represented by Yuan Shikai. The reactionary tide surged back. The situation in China worsened day by day. In his despair, Dr. Sun Yat-sen encountered the great October Revolution led by Lenin and the Chinese Communist Party represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, making the greatest turn in his life.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen, despite the opposition of the diehards within the Kuomintang, resolutely carried out the policy of allying with Lenin's Soviet Russia, allying with the Chinese Communist Party, and assisting the workers and peasants. He cooperated with the Chinese Communist Party and reinterpreted his Three Principles of the People. Chairman Mao said: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's greatness lies not only in his leadership of the great Xinhai Revolution (though it was an old-style democratic revolution), but also in his ability to 'adapt to the world trend and meet the needs of the people,' proposing the three revolutionary policies of allying with Russia, allying with the Communists, and assisting the workers and peasants, giving a new interpretation to the Three Principles of the People, and establishing the new Three Principles of the People with the three policies."

Dr. Sun Yat-sen, as a great revolutionary of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution period, left us many beneficial things in his struggling life.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life shows that a true patriot, a true revolutionary democrat, must resolutely and uncompromisingly oppose imperialism. From the beginning of his revolutionary activities, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was determined to free China from the oppression, slavery, and bullying of the imperialist powers. In his early years, Dr. Sun Yat-sen also had some illusions; he had repeatedly appealed to capitalist countries for aid, only to find that everything was in vain and instead suffered ruthless blows. Through the painful lessons of practice, especially under the influence of the October Revolution led by Lenin, Dr. Sun Yat-sen finally realized that imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Chinese people. He dared to respond to Lenin's call to resist imperialism and publicly raised the banner of resistance against imperialism. This is a very precious experience and lesson learned by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the Chinese people in their long revolutionary struggle.

Today, American imperialism is the most vicious common enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world. American imperialism occupies our territory of Taiwan, is hostile to the Chinese people, and uses the traitor to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, as its running dog. American imperialism invades Vietnam and continuously expands the war of aggression against Vietnam. American imperialism and its running dogs are enslaving and suppressing the broad masses of revolutionary people in vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we must further carry forward Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of struggle against imperialism, strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the complete unification of the motherland, resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and resolutely support the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world in their struggle against imperialism.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen saw the hope of liberation for oppressed nations and peoples in the October Revolution led by Lenin. However, today the Soviet leadership has completely betrayed the great Lenin and the great cause of the October Revolution. They pursue the revisionist line of Khrushchev, betray the revolutionary interests of the people of the world, maintain the rule of imperialism and colonialism in the capitalist world, and carry out capitalist restoration in the socialist world. They collude with American imperialism to oppose socialist China; they are eager for U.S.-Soviet collaboration to dominate the world. They have degenerated into the accomplices of American imperialism. Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we must, together with the revolutionary people of the world, resolutely oppose the Soviet revisionist group that betrays Lenin and colludes with American imperialism, and carry the struggle against modern revisionism through to the end.

The times are advancing. In the 41 years since the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, have completed the democratic revolution that Dr. Sun did not complete and developed this revolution into a socialist revolution, achieving great successes in the cause of socialist construction. The face of China has completely changed. At the beginning of this century, Dr. Sun Yat-sen once predicted that the Chinese people, with their "indignation and self-strengthening," would definitely break the rules and, with "unprecedented speed," catch up with and surpass the West in a few decades. Dr. Sun's ideal is being realized in our hands. Recently, the successful test of our country's missile and nuclear weapons once again shows that the Chinese proletariat not only can do what the bourgeois revolutionaries could not, but also will definitely, in a not too long historical period, build our country into a modernized socialist power, catching up with and surpassing the West.

At present, we are carrying out an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution throughout the country. This is a new stage of deeper and broader development of our socialist revolution. It is a great revolution that breaks the "four olds" of the exploiting classes, establishes the "four news" of the proletariat, and touches people's souls. In this great revolution, there is a struggle between two lines. We must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' spirit of initiative. We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and never stop halfway. We must carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. The victory of this great revolution will not only ensure that our socialist motherland will never change color but will also release tremendous material forces, making our socialist construction cause advance by leaps and bounds.

The great struggle and great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao far surpass the ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we must forever follow our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, forever be with the revolutionary people, strive to learn new things, constantly transform ourselves, and advance forever in the fire of the socialist revolution!

The great revolutionary forerunner Dr. Sun Yat-sen will be immortal!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    在孙中山先生诞生一百周年纪念大会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    今天，是孙中山先生诞生的一百周年。
    在孙中山先生诞生九十周年的时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席写了《纪念孙中山先生》这篇著名的文章，对孙中山先生革命的战斗的一生作出了崇高的评价。毛主席说：
    “纪念伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生！
    纪念他在中国民主革命准备时期，以鲜明的中国革命民主派立场，同中国改良派作了尖锐的斗争。他在这一场斗争中是中国革命民主派的旗帜。
    纪念他在辛亥革命时期，领导人民推翻帝制、建立共和国的丰功伟绩。
    纪念他在第一次国共合作时期，把旧三民主义发展为新三民主义的丰功伟绩。
    他在政治思想方面留给我们许多有益的东西。
    现代中国人，除了一小撮反动分子以外，都是孙先生革命事业的继承者。”
    在中国民主革命的准备时期，存在着两条政治路线的斗争：一条是孙中山先生所代表的革命的民主派的路线，一条是康有为、梁启超所代表的改良派的路线。
    孙中山先生，从革命民主派的立场出发，主张用革命的手段推翻清朝政府，建立民主共和国。康有为恰恰相反。他从改良派的立场出发，主张不触动清朝皇帝统治的根本利益，反对革命，破坏革命。在孙中山先生的领导下，革命派同改良派展开了一场大论战，为辛亥革命作了思想上的准备。
    孙中山先生领导的辛亥革命，具有伟大的历史意义。这场革命没有完成反帝反封建的民主革命任务，但结束了中国两千多年的封建帝制，推动了民主精神的高涨。中国人民将永远纪念孙中山先生在这个革命中所起的作用。
    在辛亥革命以后的十年内，孙中山先生经历了一段漫长的失望、苦闷和探索的过程。辛亥革命的果实被袁世凯为代表的大地主、大买办势力篡夺了。反动的逆流重新增长起来。中国的情况一天比一天坏。在绝望里，孙中山先生遇到了列宁领导的伟大的十月革命和以毛泽东同志为代表而创立的中国共产党，实行了他一生中最伟大的转变。
    孙中山先生不顾国民党内顽固派的反对，坚决地实行了联合列宁斯大林的苏维埃俄国、联合中国共产党、扶助农工三大政策。他同中国共产党合作，重新解释了他的三民主义。毛主席说：“孙中山先生之所以伟大，不但因为他领导了伟大的辛亥革命（虽然是旧时期的民主革命），而且因为他能够‘适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要’，提出了联俄、联共、扶助农工三大革命政策，对三民主义作了新的解释，树立了三大政策的新三民主义。”
    孙中山先生，作为中国资产阶级民主革命时期的一个伟大革命家，他的奋斗的一生留给我们很多有益的东西。
    孙中山先生的一生表明：一个真正的爱国者，一个真正的革命民主派，必须坚决地、毫不妥协地反对帝国主义。孙中山先生从他开始革命活动时起，就立志要使中国从帝国主义列强的压迫、奴役和欺凌下摆脱出来。在早年，孙中山先生也存在过某些幻想，他曾多次地向资本主义国家呼吁过援助，结果却一切落空，反而遭到了无情的打击。经过了实践的痛苦教训，特别是在列宁领导的十月革命的影响下，孙中山先生终于认清了帝国主义是中国人民的死对头。他敢于响应列宁的反帝号召，公开向帝国主义高举起反抗的旗帜。这是孙中山先生、也是中国人民在长期革命斗争的实践中取得的一个极其宝贵的经验教训。
    今天，美帝国主义是中国人民和全世界人民最凶恶的共同敌人。美帝国主义霸占我国领土台湾，敌视中国人民，利用孙中山先生的叛徒蒋介石作为它的走狗。美帝国主义侵略越南，不断扩大侵越战争。美帝国主义及其走狗正在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲广大地区内奴役和镇压广大的革命人民。我们今天纪念孙中山先生，就要进一步发扬孙中山先生的反帝斗争精神，为解放台湾、实现祖国领土的完全统一而奋斗，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民的反帝革命斗争。
    孙中山先生从列宁领导的十月革命中看到了被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的希望。可是，今天苏联领导集团完全背叛了伟大的列宁，背叛了伟大的十月革命的道路。他们推行赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线，出卖世界人民的革命利益，在资本主义世界维护帝国主义、殖民主义的统治，在社会主义世界实行资本主义复辟。他们联合美帝国主义，反对社会主义的中国；他们热衷于美苏合作，主宰世界。他们已经堕落成为美帝国主义的帮凶。我们今天纪念孙中山先生，就一定要同全世界革命人民一道，坚决反对背叛列宁、联合美帝国主义的苏共修正主义集团，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    时代不断前进。在孙中山先生逝世四十一年的时间内，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，完成了孙先生没有完成的民主革命，并且把这个革命发展为社会主义革命，在社会主义建设事业中取得了伟大的成就。中国的面貌已经完全改变了。孙中山先生在本世纪初曾经预言，中国人民“发愤自雄”，一定能够打破常规，以“异常之速度”，在几十年内赶上和超过西方。孙先生的理想正在我们手中得到实现。前不久，我国导弹核武器试验成功，再一次表明，中国无产阶级不仅能够做到中国资产阶级革命家不能做到的事情，而且一定能够在不太长的历史时期内把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化强国，赶上和超过西方。
    当前我们正在全国范围内开展一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。这是我国社会主义革命发展的一个更深入更广阔的新阶段。这是一场破剥削阶级的“四旧”、立无产阶级的“四新”、触及人们灵魂的大革命。在这场大革命中存在着两条路线的斗争。我们必须彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。我们必须发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，决不半途而废。我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。这场大革命的胜利，不仅将保证我们社会主义的祖国永不变色，而且必将激发出巨大的物质力量，使我国的社会主义建设事业更加一日千里地向前发展。
    中国人民在毛主席领导下所进行的伟大斗争，所取得的伟大胜利，都远远超过了孙中山先生的理想。毛泽东主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方针。我们今天纪念孙中山先生，就要永远跟着我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，永远同革命人民在一起，努力学习新事物，不断改造自己，在社会主义革命的烈火中永远前进！
    伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生永垂不朽！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
