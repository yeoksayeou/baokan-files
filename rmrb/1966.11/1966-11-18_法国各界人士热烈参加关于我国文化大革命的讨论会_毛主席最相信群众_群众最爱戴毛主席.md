The France-China Friendship Association held a discussion meeting on the evening of the 10th in Paris to introduce the situation of China's proletarian cultural revolution. More than 600 people attended the meeting with great interest. Those who spoke at the meeting all enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong, who is leading the cultural revolution, and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Professor Charles Bettelheim, the executive chairman of the association's national committee, presided over the meeting. He pointed out that the Chinese cultural revolution is a historic and extremely important event.

Writer Jean Babin, in his speech, emphasized that after socialist countries have carried out political and economic socialist revolutions, they must also carry out socialist revolutions in ideology and the superstructure.

He also said that the characteristic of the Chinese revolution is to believe in the masses and follow the mass line. He stressed the great role played by Chinese youth in the cultural revolution and the significance of their self-education and raising of revolutionary consciousness through this great revolution.

Editor-in-chief of *Nouvel Observateur* Roger Bérégovoy said that the Chinese leaders let the youth go to the streets and make a revolution, which shows that Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party have great trust in the people and the youth.

When talking about China's "four bigs" (speaking out freely, airing views fully, writing big-character posters, and holding great debates), he said, "Why can China have such great democracy and freedom? This is because Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party believe in the masses the most."

During the question-and-answer session, an audience member gave an impromptu speech. He pointed out that the Chinese people highly respect Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought because Mao Zedong Thought is scientific and has universal significance.

He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of our times, and Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our times."

Jean Babin and Roger Bérégovoy also cited facts in their speeches to refute the slanders of imperialist and revisionist publications against the Chinese cultural revolution.

They also discussed the issue of "revolutionizing to promote production." Babin said, "Through the revolution, people's consciousness is raised. The higher the consciousness, the better they can complete production tasks."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Paris, the student committee of the France-China Friendship Association held a meeting on the 4th in Paris and passed a resolution to enthusiastically acclaim our country's proletarian cultural revolution.

The meeting pointed out: "The cultural revolution led by Mao Zedong himself and his closest comrade-in-arms Lin Biao has unprecedentedly strengthened the power of the Chinese people and the determination of progressive people and revolutionaries in all countries of the world."

The meeting, in a resolution titled "Refute the Slanders Against China!", emphasized: "Today, the attitude towards the Chinese people and the proletarian cultural revolution is the dividing line between progressive forces and anti-people forces."

The resolution said: "It is precisely because there are people singing the anti-China chorus that we are more resolute than ever before in supporting the Chinese people's cultural revolution and their struggle against American imperialism and all its lackeys."

    毛主席最相信群众　群众最爱戴毛主席
    新华社巴黎电　法中友好协会十日晚上在巴黎举行讨论会，介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的情况。六百多人满怀兴趣地参加了讨论会，在会上发言的人都热烈赞扬领导这次文化大革命的毛泽东主席和伟大的毛泽东思想。
    协会全国委员会执行主席夏尔·贝特尔海姆教授主持讨论会。他指出，中国文化大革命是一个具有历史意义的、非常重要的事件。
    作家让·巴毕在讲话中强调指出，社会主义国家在进行了政治上和经济上的社会主义革命之后，还必须进行意识形态、上层建筑的社会主义革命。
    他还说，中国革命的特点就是相信群众，走群众路线，他强调指出了中国青年在文化大革命中所起的巨大作用和他们通过这场大革命自己教育自己，提高革命觉悟的意义。
    《新人道报》总编辑勒纪·贝热龙说，中国领导人让青年走上街头，闹革命，这表明毛主席和中国共产党对人民、对青年非常信任。
    他在谈到中国的大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论时说，中国为什么能有这样大的民主、自由呢？这就是因为毛主席和中国共产党最相信群众。
    在提问题的时候，一位听众发表了即席讲话。他指出，中国人民高度爱戴毛主席和毛泽东思想，这是因为毛泽东思想是科学，它具有普遍的意义。
    他说，毛泽东思想是我们时代的马克思列宁主义，毛泽东是我们时代的列宁。
    让·巴毕和勒纪·贝热龙在讲话中还列举事实，驳斥了帝国主义和修正主义报刊对中国文化大革命的诬蔑。
    他们还谈到抓革命促生产的问题。巴毕说，通过革命，人们的觉悟提高了。觉悟越高，就越能更好的完成生产任务。
    据新华社巴黎电　法中友好协会大学生委员会四日在巴黎举行大会，通过决议热烈欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命。
    大会指出：“由毛泽东本人和他的最亲密的战友林彪领导的文化大革命，空前地加强了中国人民的力量和世界各国进步人士和革命者的决心。”
    大会在题为《驳斥对中国的诬蔑！》的决议中着重指出：“今天，对待中国人民和无产阶级文化大革命的态度，是进步力量和反人民的势力之间的分界线。”
    决议说：“正是因为有人在搞反华大合唱，所以我们比过去任何时候更加坚决地支持中国人民的文化大革命和他们为反对美帝国主义及其所有帮凶而进行的斗争。”
