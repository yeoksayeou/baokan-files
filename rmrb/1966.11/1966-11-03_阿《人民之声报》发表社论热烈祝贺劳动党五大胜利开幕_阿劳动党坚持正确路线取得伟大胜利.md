The People's Voice Newspaper Publishes an Editorial to Warmly Congratulate the Successful Opening of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania
The Party of Labour of Albania Persists in the Correct Line and Achieves Great Victories

	NEW YORK, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) — The central organ of the Party of Labour of Albania, the newspaper The People's Voice, today published an editorial entitled "The Congress of the Invincible Revolutionary Fighters" to warmly congratulate the successful opening of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania in Tirana.

	The editorial said, the attention and concern of all the working people, communists, and non-party members of our country are focused here. The inspirer, leader, and organizer of all the victories of our people — the Party of Labour — will summarize the work and achievements since the Fourth Congress and, on the basis of a Marxist-Leninist scientific analysis of the domestic and international situation, determine the new tasks for the future.

	The editorial said, from the Fourth Congress of the Party to the Fifth Congress, this is one of the most glorious periods in the life of our Party and our people. Despite the difficulties, especially the difficulties caused by the sabotage of the traitorous revisionists of Khrushchev, we have excellently completed the tasks set out, and the cause of socialist construction in our country has been continuously advancing. The line of our Party, which holds a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, and builds socialism through self-reliance, has been fully manifested in this great endeavor. At the same time, the People's Republic of China has generously provided us with comprehensive, fraternal, and profound internationalist aid, which has played an important role in our overcoming difficulties and completing the main tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan.

	The editorial pointed out: The Party of Labour of Albania has never separated the struggle for the construction of Albanian socialism from the struggle of the whole world for socialism, freedom, and peace. Therefore, at a time when imperialism led by the United States is expanding its aggression and the Khrushchev revisionists are intensifying their sabotage and speeding up their collusion with the United States to dominate the world, our Party and people have always been at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism, for the defense of peace, freedom, and the sovereignty of all peoples, actively supporting the national liberation struggles and revolutionary movements around the world. In the uncompromising struggle against the traitorous Khrushchev revisionists, Tito, and his followers, we have loyally and resolutely defended the purity of Marxism-Leninism, honorably fulfilled our internationalist duties, and continuously enhanced the prestige of our Party and people in the hearts of all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world.

	The editorial said: The great victories of historic significance achieved by the Party since the Fourth Congress are the result of the implementation of its correct and consistently victorious line, the result of the most faithful defense and consistent implementation of the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The revolutionary line of our Party, which has been manifested once again in the two historic documents, the Party and Government Manifesto and the Open Letter of the Central Committee, has further ignited the political enthusiasm and combat effectiveness of the masses to build and defend socialism, making the life of the whole country more active and healthy. All this has made the plans, conspiracies, and blockades of the imperialists and revisionists come to nothing, enabling us to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and achieve one victory after another. On this historic day, what makes all our people feel excited and proud is that our Party of Labour, as it welcomes its Fifth Congress, is stronger than ever, more closely united around the Central Committee headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the unity between the Party and the people is more solid, and its experience is richer and more comprehensive. All this is the healthy foundation for our eternal advance.

    阿《人民之声报》发表社论热烈祝贺劳动党五大胜利开幕
    阿劳动党坚持正确路线取得伟大胜利
    新华社地拉那一日电  阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关报《人民之声报》今天发表题为《不可战胜的革命战士的代表大会》的社论，热烈祝贺阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会在地拉那胜利开幕。
    社论说，我国全体劳动人民群众、共产党人和非党人士的目光和注意力都投向了这里。我国人民的一切胜利的鼓舞者、领导者和组织者——劳动党，将总结从第四次代表大会以来的工作和成就，并在对国内外形势进行马克思列宁主义科学分析的基础上确定今后的新任务。
    社论说，从党的第四次代表大会到第五次代表大会，是我们党和我国人民生活中最光荣的阶段之一。尽管处在困难的条件下，特别是处在由于赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒的破坏而造成的困难条件下，但是，我们出色地完成了所制定的任务，我国社会主义建设事业不断地向前迈进。我们党的一手拿镐、一手拿枪、自力更生建设社会主义的路线，在这一巨大的劳动中得到了充分的体现。同时，中华人民共和国慷慨地给予我国的全面的、兄弟般的、深厚的国际主义援助，在我们克服困难和完成第三个五年计划的主要任务的过程中起了重要的作用。
    社论指出：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党从来没有把阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设的斗争同全世界争取社会主义、自由与和平的斗争分割开来。因此，在以美国为首的帝国主义扩大侵略和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者加紧破坏并加速进行美苏合作主宰世界的勾结的时候，我们党和我国人民一直站在反帝、保卫和平、自由和各国人民的主权、积极支援世界各地的民族解放斗争和革命运动的斗争的最前列，在同叛徒赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、铁托及其追随者毫不妥协的斗争中，忠实和坚决地捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，光荣地履行自己的国际主义义务，使我党和我国人民在所有的马克思列宁主义者和全世界革命人民的心目中的威信不断提高。
    社论说：党从第四次代表大会以来所取得的具有历史意义的伟大胜利，是实施她的正确的、一贯胜利的路线的结果，是最忠实地捍卫和始终如一地执行马克思列宁主义原则的结果。我党一贯的革命路线在党和政府的号召书和党中央的公开信这两个历史性文献里又一次表现了它的生命力，这两个文献使群众建设和保卫社会主义的政治热情更加高涨、战斗力更强，使国家的一切生活更加活跃和健康。这一切使帝国主义者、修正主义者的计划、阴谋和封锁化为泡影，使我们战胜了一切困难和阻碍，取得了一个又一个的胜利。在这个具有历史意义的日子里，我们全国人民感到兴奋和自豪的是，我们的劳动党在迎接她的第五次代表大会的时候，比任何时候都更坚强，更紧密地团结在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的中央委员会的周围，党同人民之间的团结更加牢固，她的经验更加丰富、更加全面。这一切都是将来永远前进的健康基础。
