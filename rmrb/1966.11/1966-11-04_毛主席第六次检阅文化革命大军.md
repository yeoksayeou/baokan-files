In the triumphant songs of the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao reviews the Cultural Revolution Army for the sixth time.

Comrade Lin Biao made an important speech, pointing out: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, the broad revolutionary masses of our country have created new experiences in developing great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This great democracy is a new form of combining Mao Zedong Thought with the broad masses, a new form of the masses educating themselves, and a new contribution by Chairman Mao to the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd: In the triumphant songs of the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, today in the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the capital of our great motherland, Beijing—received revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country. This is the sixth time in two months, including National Day, that Chairman Mao has received revolutionary students from all over the country.

Under the good situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing more deeply, broadly, and healthily, revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country who came to Beijing for revolutionary linkage received Chairman Mao's warm reception, which greatly encouraged them. They joyfully shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!"

Today, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, in the reception meeting that lasted more than seven hours, were full of energy and in high spirits, always with everyone. Chairman Mao walked steadily on Tiananmen Rostrum, going back and forth nine times between the east and west ends of the rostrum, waving and clapping to the cheering crowd. The revolutionary youngsters, as they passed through the square, jumped and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand times long live!" They said excitedly, "Our Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao are so healthy, this is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and all the people of the world."

The revolutionary youngsters said with great emotion that our Chairman Mao cares most about the masses, believes most in the masses, and mobilizes the masses most. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has most resolutely supported the pioneering spirit of the revolutionary masses. They firmly declared that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite closely on the basis of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, advance victoriously, thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line, eliminate its poison, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Today, the capital presented a scene of revolutionary fervor. Revolutionary youngsters from all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and red flags, gathered from all directions of the city to Tiananmen Square and the east side roads. When the sky was red with dawn, the spirited Red Guards opened their shiny red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud, singing "The East is Red" and songs composed with quotations from Chairman Mao. They sang joyfully: "The golden sun rises in the east, shining with ten thousand rays of light. The east wind blows for ten thousand miles, flowers bloom red, and the red flags are like a vast sea. The great leader, the wise guide, the beloved Chairman Mao, the sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people, the red sun in their hearts."

At 10:10 AM, when the military band played "The East is Red," Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as central and other leaders Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Deng Xiaoping, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Chen Yun, Song Qingling, Dong Biwu, Chen Yi, He Long, Tan Zhenlin, Xu Xiangqian, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Jiang Qing, Liu Zhijian, Zhang Chunqiao, Wu De, etc., ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum review stand. At this moment, the entire Tiananmen Square became a sea of red waves. Millions of eyes full of deep affection looked up at Chairman Mao, and millions of arms wearing red armbands waved the shiny red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting and jumping endlessly. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" were like rolling thunder, shaking the sky of the capital.

Comrade Chen Boda, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, announced the beginning of the meeting.

Comrade Lin Biao spoke in the midst of enthusiastic applause from the entire audience (the full text will be published separately).

Comrade Lin Biao first, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, extended the warmest welcome to the revolutionary students and Red Guard fighters who came to Beijing to visit Chairman Mao and conduct revolutionary linkage.

He said, Chairman Mao is the greatest proletarian revolutionary, always with the masses, fully trusting the masses, sharing their joys and sorrows, and wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary mass movement. Chairman Mao has set a brilliant example for the whole Party and the younger generation.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out that the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is very good! The great thought of Mao Zedong is more widely spread and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Under Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," the Cultural Revolution has promoted the ideological transformation of people, pushed forward the leapfrog development of industrial and agricultural production and science and technology. The recent successful test of launching missiles and nuclear weapons is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory of the proletarian cultural revolution!

He said, the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee declared the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bankruptcy of the capitalist reactionary line. In the past two months, Chairman Mao's correct line has met with the broad masses and been grasped by them, launching a criticism of the wrong line. Chairman Mao's call for everyone to care about state affairs has truly become the action of the broad masses. This is a great thing. This is an important guarantee for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

He pointed out that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is incompatible with the capitalist reactionary line. Only by thoroughly criticizing the capitalist reactionary line and eliminating its influence can Chairman Mao's line be correctly, completely, and thoroughly implemented.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, the broad revolutionary masses of our country have created new experiences in developing great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This great democracy is the Party fearlessly allowing the broad masses to use the forms of big debates, big-character posters, big linkages, and big criticisms to criticize and supervise the Party and state organs and leaders at all levels. At the same time, according to the principles of the Paris Commune, fully realizing the democratic rights of the people. This great democracy is a new form of combining Mao Zedong Thought with the broad masses, a new form of the masses educating themselves. This great democracy is Chairman Mao's new contribution to the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

He emphasized that the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship proves that without such a thorough Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, without implementing such great democracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat will weaken and degenerate, and capitalism will use various forms to restore itself, and the exploiting class will once again ride on the heads of the people.

He said, such great democracy must be thoroughly implemented not only between the leadership and the masses but also among the masses, among the masses themselves. Without such great democracy among the masses, without being good at consulting each other, listening to different opinions, presenting facts and reasoning, and thinking deeply about problems, it is impossible to educate oneself, liberate oneself, achieve the goal of developing the leftist forces, uniting the majority, and isolating a handful of rightists, and it is impossible to fully implement the line of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by our great teacher—Chairman Mao.

Comrade Lin Biao said, Chairman Mao supports comrades walking for linkage. The advantage of walking for linkage is that it can widely contact the masses and various aspects of society, more deeply understand the class struggle in a socialist society. It can better learn from the workers and peasants and spread Mao Zedong Thought in a wider range. This is very beneficial for revolutionary students to further understand Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's correct line. Of course, such walking for linkage must be carried out in a planned, organized, and prepared manner.

Comrade Lin Biao finally said, the Party Central Committee believes that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has had several months of experience and will be better carried out in the future, achieving greater success!

Comrade Lin Biao's speech aroused wave after wave of thunderous applause from the entire audience.

At 10:20 AM, the grand parade began to the music of "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsman." Revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country, waving the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" and marched through Tiananmen Square in an endless stream, accepting the review of the supreme commander Chairman Mao. In this cultural revolution army, there were revolutionary youths from Chairman Mao's hometown, revolutionary descendants from the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, and many revolutionary students from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, the north and south of the Tian Mountains, and the banks of the Jinsha River. There were also emancipated serfs from the Tibetan Plateau. They came to accept the review of the beloved leader Chairman Mao, expressing their firm will to always be loyal to Chairman Mao, resolutely defend and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Some revolutionary students from the military academies of the People's Liberation Army of China today, with boundless excitement and joy, accepted the review of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao together with revolutionary youngsters from all over the country. Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform, stood firmly on the Tiananmen Rostrum, smiling kindly, and waved to the revolutionary youngsters repeatedly, making them very excited. They said excitedly, "What is the reddest in the world? The sun on Tiananmen is the reddest! Who is the closest in the world? The great leader Chairman Mao is the closest! What is the happiest in the world? Seeing the great commander Chairman Mao is the happiest! What is the most glorious task in the world? Studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought is the most glorious!" The students of a certain military school in the Air Force just returned from a political camp in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an to Beijing. They visited the places where Chairman Mao once lived in Yangjialing and the site of the "Seventh Congress" in Yan'an, recalling the glorious history of our Party and Army. Today, they saw Chairman Mao, whom they had been thinking of day and night. Many of them wrote poems and pledges on the spot to Chairman Mao, solemnly vowing to always implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, struggle for a lifetime, and revolution to the end!

Tens of thousands of revolutionary students and Red Guards from Shanghai today came to Tiananmen in high spirits. In the early morning, the revolutionary youngsters of East China Normal University studied and discussed the editorial of the "Red Flag" magazine: "The Victory of the Proletarian Revolutionary Line Represented by Chairman Mao." They said, this editorial spoke their minds. They recalled the education they received from visiting the site of the First National Congress of the Party in Shanghai, deeply feeling that since the First National Congress of the Party, Chairman Mao has always represented the correct line of the Party. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been, is, and will forever be the greatest guarantee of revolutionary victory. These revolutionary youngsters today happily saw the beloved leader Chairman Mao and said excitedly: We cheer for Chairman Mao, which means cheering for victory. We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the line indicated by Chairman Mao, and fight bravely to achieve greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary youngsters from the revolutionary historical city of Zunyi today, as they passed through Tiananmen Square, saw our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, and they were so excited that tears welled up in their eyes. They repeatedly shouted, "Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" A youngster from Zunyi No. 2 Middle School said, "The Zunyi Conference established the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao in the entire Party. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao's correct line, our revolutionary cause has prospered day by day, moving from victory to victory. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has again defeated the capitalist reactionary line and achieved a great victory." He wrote in his diary: I must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I vow to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, following Chairman Mao to revolution for a lifetime.

Many overseas Chinese youths who recently returned from Indonesia today, with the deep affection of overseas Chinese for their motherland and Chairman Mao, accepted Chairman Mao's review. Before they returned to their country, the Indonesian reactionary authorities had subjected them to various tortures and persecutions, forcing them to hand over and burn Chairman Mao's works. However, the great thought of Mao Zedong gave these youths boundless strength. They said, "Our heads can be cut off, and our blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be discarded." They unyieldingly fought against the Indonesian reactionary authorities, risking their lives to preserve Chairman Mao's works. Today, they waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" given by their compatriots and said passionately: We will study Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime, use Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime, and anyone who tries to restore capitalism in China is trying to make us overseas Chinese return to the bitter days of the past. We will never agree to it.

Today's meeting was attended by more than 200,000 revolutionary students. Among the more than 100,000 revolutionary youngsters who accepted Chairman Mao's review, there were many revolutionary youths like the "Long March Red Guards" of Dalian Maritime Academy, who, to temper themselves into the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause that Chairman Mao expects, set out from their hometowns and walked all the way to the capital to accept Chairman Mao's review. Eleven Red Guard youngsters from Bengbu Railway Middle School in Bengbu, Anhui, who marched to Beijing, today happily ascended the viewing platform in front of Tiananmen. When Chairman Mao appeared on the Tiananmen Rostrum, they sang "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsman" and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" thousands of times. They said, "Chairman Mao! We have walked to your side for revolutionary linkage. Now, please review us!" These eleven youngsters formed the "Long March Propaganda Team of Mao Zedong Thought," with indomitable willpower, set out from Bengbu, walked more than 2,000 li, and spent 44 days to successfully arrive in Beijing. Along the way, they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, tempered their revolutionary will, and learned from the workers and peasants. When they saw Chairman Mao, they said excitedly: Chairman Mao cares so much about us young people. We will definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao to revolution for a lifetime, and pass on the red genealogy of the working class from generation to generation. With the heroic image of the Red Army not fearing the difficulties of the Long March as an example, the "Long March Red Guards" of Jingzong Agricultural Middle School in Linzi County, Shandong Province, used eight days and nights, averaging 110 li per day, to walk to Beijing. Today, when they accepted Chairman Mao's review, they, with deep respect and gratitude, presented the banner of the "Long March Red Guards" they sewed during their march to the beloved Chairman Mao. They also wrote a letter full of revolutionary enthusiasm to Chairman Mao, reporting their "achievements" during their march. The letter said: Most beloved leader Chairman Mao, we will definitely keep in mind your encouragement and guidance. We will definitely follow you to revolution for a lifetime, always maintain the revolutionary nature of the proletariat, and always be a small fighting team in the great revolutionary army led by you.

    在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中
    毛主席第六次检阅文化革命大军
    林彪同志发表重要讲话指出：在毛主席正确路线指引下，我国广大革命群众，创造了无产阶级专政下发展大民主的新经验。这种大民主，是毛泽东思想同广大群众相结合的新形式，是群众自己教育自己的新形式，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的新贡献。
    新华社三日讯　在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，今天在无产阶级文化大革命中心——我们伟大祖国的首都北京，接见来自全国各地的革命师生和红卫兵。这是两个多月来，连国庆节在内，毛主席对来自全国各地革命师生第六次的接见。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动更深入、更广阔、更健康地向前发展的大好形势下，从全国各地来北京进行革命串连的革命师生和红卫兵们，受到毛主席的亲切接见，万分鼓舞。他们纵情欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利万岁！”
    今天，我们伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，在持续七个多小时的接见大会上，精力充沛，神采焕发，一直和大家在一起。毛主席在天安门城楼上迈着稳健的步伐，先后九次走向城楼的东、西两端，向欢呼的人群亲切招手、鼓掌。革命小将们通过广场时，狂欢跳跃，千遍万遍地高呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们无比兴奋地说：“我们的毛主席和林彪同志身体这样健康，这是全中国人民和全世界人民最大的幸福。”
    革命小将们满怀激动的心情说，我们的毛主席最关心群众，最相信群众，最放手发动群众。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席最坚决地支持了革命群众的首创精神。他们坚定地表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的基础上，紧密地团结起来，乘胜前进，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清其流毒，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    今天，首都呈现一片热气腾腾的革命景象。来自全国各省、市、自治区的革命小将们，高举毛主席像和红旗，从全城四面八方连夜汇向天安门广场，汇向广场东侧的条条大道上。当朝霞映红天空的时候，英姿焕发的红卫兵们便翻开红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，迎着冉冉升起的红太阳朗读起来，一遍又一遍地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和用毛主席语录谱成的歌曲。他们纵情地歌唱：“金色的太阳升起在东方光芒万丈，东风万里鲜花开放红旗像大海洋。伟大的领袖英明的导师敬爱的毛主席，革命人民心中的太阳心中的红太阳。”
    上午十时十分，当军乐队奏起《东方红》乐曲时，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央和其他方面的领导同志周恩来、陶铸、陈伯达、邓小平、刘少奇、朱德、李富春、陈云、宋庆龄、董必武、陈毅、贺龙、谭震林、徐向前、李雪峰、谢富治、刘宁一、萧华、杨成武、江青、刘志坚、张春桥、吴德等登上了天安门城楼检阅台。这时，整个天安门广场成了红浪翻腾的海洋。千万双充满深情的眼睛仰望着毛主席，千万双佩戴红袖章的手臂挥舞着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，不停地欢呼跳跃，“毛主席万岁”“毛主席万万岁”的欢呼声，就像滚滚春雷，震荡着首都的天空。
    中共中央政治局常委、中央文化革命小组组长陈伯达同志宣布大会开始。
    林彪同志在全场热烈的掌声中讲话（全文另发）。
    林彪同志首先代表我们伟大领袖毛主席，代表党中央，向前来北京看望毛主席和进行革命串连的革命师生和红卫兵战士表示最热烈的欢迎。
    他说，毛主席是最伟大的无产阶级革命家，他总是同群众在一起，充分地信任群众，和群众同呼吸，共命运，全心全意支持革命的群众运动。毛主席给全党同志，给青年一代，树立了最光辉的榜样。
    林彪同志指出，当前，无产阶级文化大革命的形势很好！伟大的毛泽东思想更加普及，更加深入人心。在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召下，文化大革命促进了人的思想革命化，推动了工农业生产和科学技术的飞跃发展。最近发射导弹核武器的试验成功，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是无产阶级文化革命的伟大胜利！
    他说，党的八届十一中全会，宣告了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产。两个多月来，毛主席的正确路线同广大群众见面，为广大群众所掌握，展开了对错误路线的批判。毛主席号召大家关心国家大事，真正变成了广大群众的行动。这是极大的好事。这是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的重要保证。
    他指出，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级反动路线，是水火不相容的。只有彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，清除这条路线的影响，才能正确地、完全地、彻底地执行毛主席的路线。
    林彪同志指出，在毛主席正确路线的指引下，我国广大革命群众，创造了无产阶级专政下发展大民主的新经验。这种大民主，就是党无所畏惧地让广大群众运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连的形式，批评和监督党和国家的各级领导机关和各级领导人。同时，按照巴黎公社的原则，充分实现人民民主权利。这种大民主，是毛泽东思想同广大群众相结合的新形式，是群众自己教育自己的新形式。这种大民主，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的新贡献。
    他强调指出，国际无产阶级专政的历史经验证明，没有进行这样彻底的无产阶级文化大革命，没有实行这样的大民主，无产阶级专政就会削弱，就会变质，资本主义就要采用各种形式复辟，剥削阶级就会重新骑在人民的头上。
    他说，这样大民主，不但领导和群众之间必须彻底实行，而且，在群众中，在群众相互之间，也完全必须彻底实行。在群众之间，没有这样的大民主，不善于互相商量，不善于倾听不同的意见，不善于摆事实讲道理，不善于开动脑筋，思考问题，这样，就不可能自己教育自己，自己解放自己，就不可能达到发展左派队伍，团结大多数，孤立一小撮资产阶级右派的目的，就不可能不折不扣地实行我们伟大导师——毛主席所提出的无产阶级文化大革命的路线。
    林彪同志说，毛主席是支持同志们步行串连的。步行串连的好处，可以广泛地接触群众，接触社会的各个方面，更深入了解社会主义社会的阶级斗争。可以更好地向工农学习，在更宽广的范围内，传播毛泽东思想。这样做，对于革命师生进一步领会毛泽东思想，领会毛主席的正确路线，是大有好处的。当然，这种步行串连，必须有计划、有组织、有准备地进行。
    林彪同志最后说，党中央相信，无产阶级文化大革命已经有了几个月的经验，今后将会更好地进行，取得更大的成就！
    林彪同志的讲话在全场激起一阵又一阵暴风雨般的掌声。
    上午十点二十分，在《大海航行靠舵手》的乐曲声中开始了盛大的游行。来自全国各地的革命师生和红卫兵，挥动着鲜红的《毛主席语录》，高呼“毛主席万岁”，浩浩荡荡地通过天安门广场，接受最高统帅毛主席的检阅。在这支文化革命大军中，有来自毛主席家乡的革命青少年，有来自革命圣地延安等地的革命后代，有来自内蒙古草原、天山南北和金沙江畔的许多少数民族的革命学生，还有来自西藏高原的翻身农奴子弟。他们带着全国各族青少年和亿万革命群众的嘱托，来接受敬爱的领袖毛主席的检阅，表达他们永远忠于毛主席，坚决捍卫和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的坚强意志，表达他们誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。
    中国人民解放军部分军事院校的革命师生们，今天怀着无比激动、无限喜悦的心情，和来自全国各地的革命小将一道接受了伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志的检阅。毛主席身穿草绿色军装，巍然屹立在天安门城楼上，含着慈祥的微笑，向革命小将们频频招手致意，使这些小将十分激动。他们兴奋地说：“世界上什么最红？天安门上的太阳最红！世界上什么人最亲？伟大的领袖毛主席最亲！世界上什么最幸福？见到伟大统帅毛主席最幸福！世界上什么任务最光荣？学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想最光荣！”空军某军事学校的师生们刚从革命圣地延安进行政治野营后来到北京。他们在延安参观了毛主席当年居住过的杨家岭以及“七大”会址，重温了我党我军的光辉历史。今天，他们见到日夜想念的毛主席，许多人当场写诗、写决心书向毛主席庄严宣誓，表示永远执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，奋斗一生，革命到底！
    来自上海的数以万计的革命师生和红卫兵，今天欢欣鼓舞地来到了天安门。清晨，华东师范大学的革命小将们学习讨论着《红旗》杂志社论：《以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利》。他们说，这篇社论说出了我们的心里话。他们回忆在上海参观党的第一次全国代表大会会址所受到的教育，深切体会到，从党的第一次代表大会起，毛主席就一直代表着党的正确路线，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，过去是、现在是、将来也永远是革命胜利的最大保证。这些革命小将今天幸福地见到了敬爱的领袖毛主席，无限激动地说：我们欢呼毛主席，就是欢呼胜利，我们永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席指引的路线，奋勇战斗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更大胜利。
    从遵义这个革命历史名城来京的革命小将，今天经过天安门广场时看见了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，激动得热泪盈眶，他们不断高呼：“以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”遵义二中的一位小将说：“遵义会议确立了我们伟大领袖毛主席在全党的领导地位，在毛主席正确路线的领导下，我们的革命事业一天天兴旺起来，从胜利走向胜利。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线又战胜了资产阶级反动路线，取得了伟大胜利。”他在日记本上写下了自己的誓言：我一定要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
    最近从印度尼西亚归国的许多华侨青年，今天带着海外侨胞热爱祖国、热爱毛主席的无限深情，接受了毛主席的检阅。他们回国前，印尼反动当局曾对他们进行了种种折磨和迫害，恶毒地迫使他们交出和烧毁毛主席著作。但是伟大的毛泽东思想给了这些青年无穷的力量。他们说，头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢。他们不屈不挠地同印尼反动当局斗争，冒着生命危险保藏毛主席著作。今天，他们挥舞着祖国同胞赠送的《毛主席语录》，激昂地说：我们要学一辈子毛泽东思想，用一辈子毛泽东思想，谁要企图让资本主义在中国复辟，就是想让我们华侨回到过去无依无靠的苦日子，我们坚决不答应。
    参加今天大会的，共有二百多万革命师生。在接受了毛主席检阅的一百多万革命小将中，有许多像大连海运学院“长征红卫队”那样的革命青少年，他们为了把自己锻炼成为毛主席所期望的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，从他们的家乡出发，全程步行来到了首都，接受毛主席的检阅。从安徽蚌埠行军到北京的蚌埠铁路中学的十一名红卫兵小将，今天幸福地登上了天安门前面的观礼台。当毛主席出现在天安门城楼上的时候，他们千百次地纵情高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，千百次地振臂欢呼“毛主席万岁！”他们说，“毛主席啊！我们步行串连来到您的身边，现在请您检阅吧！”这十一名小将组成的“毛泽东思想长征宣传队”，以顽强的毅力，从蚌埠出发，步行两千余里，历时四十四天，胜利到达北京。一路上，他们活学活用毛主席著作，磨炼自己的革命意志，并向工农群众学习。当见到毛主席的时候，他们激动地说：毛主席对我们青年一代这样关怀，我们一定坚决响应林彪同志的号召，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，把工人阶级的红色家谱一代一代续下去。以“红军不怕远征难”的英雄形象为榜样，山东省临淄县敬仲农中“长征赤卫队”，用八昼两夜的时间，平均每天以一百一十里的速度，步行来到北京。他们今天在接受毛主席检阅的时候，怀着无限敬意和感激的心情，把他们在行军途中缝制的“长征赤卫队”队旗，献给敬爱的毛主席。他们还给毛主席写了一封充满革命豪情的信，向毛主席汇报他们步行串连的“战绩”。信中写道：最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，我们一定要把您对我们的鼓舞和教导，记在心上。我们一定要跟着您干一辈子革命，永远保持无产阶级的革命本色，永远成为您所领导的伟大革命队伍中的一支小小战斗队。
