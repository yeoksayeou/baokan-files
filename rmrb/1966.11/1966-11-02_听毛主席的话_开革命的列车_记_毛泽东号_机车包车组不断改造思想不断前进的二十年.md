The "Mao Zedong Thought-guided people's revolution is the locomotive of history's progress."

Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, personally wrote these words on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the naming of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive.

Comrade Lin Biao's inscription is a great inspiration to the people of the entire nation!

Comrade Lin Biao's inscription is the greatest concern for all railway workers across the country!

Comrade Lin Biao's inscription is the highest award for the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew!

The "Mao Zedong" locomotive, named after our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, was born in October 1946. It has been exactly 20 years since then. During the War of Liberation, in the logistics transportation lines of the Korean War, in the busy transportation lines of socialist construction, and on the long historical road of the people's revolution, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive has rolled forward! The locomotive driver has changed five times, and more than 70 crew members have been transferred out; however, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and marched forward bravely! The "Mao Zedong" locomotive is not just a locomotive of the Beijing Railway Bureau; it is also a shining flag and a leading locomotive in the entire railway system of the country!

Over the past 20 years, the comrades of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew, with deep class feelings of boundless love, faith, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, have seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and faithfully acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They strive to be good soldiers and workers of Chairman Mao. They use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the "self" and "private" interests, resist the infiltration of various exploitative class ideologies, diligently transform their subjective world, and strive to establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and completely, thoroughly serving the people.

Over the past 20 years, they have passed down Mao Zedong Thought from one generation to the next, carried forward the glorious revolutionary tradition from one generation to the next, and cultivated a new generation of revolutionary fighters. This crew of only about a dozen crew members has sent more than 30 cadres and a large number of red workers to the country.

Over the past 20 years, they have always carried forward the revolutionary spirit of taking the lead in facing the wind and being the vanguard. In the fierce and complex class struggle, they have been clear in their hatred and love, firm in their stance, steadfast, and unyielding. They have always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stood at the forefront of the struggle, and bravely waged uncompromising struggles against all class enemies. In production struggles and scientific experiments, they transformed an old locomotive into an advanced one. They have withstood various difficulties and honors, achieving the unprecedented record of safe operation of 1,930,000 kilometers on Chinese railways. They have written the history of the locomotive with all their heart, shining with the great light of Mao Zedong Thought. People praise them: They are indeed a fighting collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought, indeed a revolutionary locomotive on the railway transportation line, and they are worthy of their glorious name "Mao Zedong."

Crushing the "self" and "private" interests

The "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew has a tradition: whenever a new worker comes on board, the crew members give him the most precious gift—the "Three Articles" and other works of Chairman Mao. On this locomotive, everyone has a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." They always carry it with them, learning wherever they go and putting what they learn into practice. As they say, "The treasure book never leaves the body, and the thought never leaves the root," meaning that actions do not deviate from the root of Mao Zedong Thought, which is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's own thoughts and guide one's actions.

For a long time, they have insisted on conducting small rectification campaigns once or twice a year, focusing tightly on the fundamental issue of "for whom to labor" and "for whom to drive the train." They have carried out criticism and self-criticism, broken down private interests and established public interests, broken down old ideas and established new ones, and firmly grasped the transformation of worldviews. Especially since 1964, they have taken Chairman Mao's three brilliant works, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Qu Yuan Moves Mountains," as their motto, as a powerful ideological weapon for transforming their souls, and as the most fundamental compulsory course for cultivating new communist people.

Driver Long Cai Lianxing has firmly grasped his own ideological transformation. In his struggle against private thoughts, he dares to confront them head-on. In every study session of Chairman Mao's works, he always takes the lead in exposing his thoughts, finding the root causes, sharing his insights, and gaining the supervision and help of others, while also inspiring the ideological revolution of the entire crew. He often fights against his thoughts after completing a task, not letting even a fleeting wrong thought slip by. Once, Cai Lianxing was waiting at the station to pull a direct freight train, just as the dispatch car was too busy to handle the vehicles. The station duty officer asked him to help with the shunting. Cai Lianxing glanced at his watch and felt the time was pressing, fearing it would delay the on-time departure. At that moment, a thought flashed through his mind: he thought of himself as the driver and feared that if he didn't help, people would say he lacked style. So, he immediately started his locomotive and completed the shunting at the fastest speed. The station duty officer, looking at him with satisfaction, said, "After all, the style of the 'Mao Zedong' is high!" That night, Cai Lianxing did not relax because of the praise. He studied "Serve the People" in response to the fleeting wrong thought that day, using the standards of "completely" and "thoroughly" to measure himself, feeling more and more ashamed. He seized this active thought, linking it to his own thoughts of seeking fame and making a name for himself when doing good deeds for the people. He exposed his thoughts and made a self-criticism at the small group meeting, making Mao Zedong Thought take deeper root in his mind.

Old driver Hu Chun Dong, who has been working on this locomotive for nearly 20 years, from stoking the fire to driving, has always worked diligently. Two of his fellow workers have successively become section chiefs and department heads, and he has had fluctuations in his thoughts. Someone said, "Others have been promoted, and only Hu Chun Dong, the fifth-generation veteran, is left!" He heard such remarks and always felt a bit uncomfortable. He took this question and opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune." A few lines of golden words shone before his eyes: "A foreigner, without any selfish motives, took the cause of the Chinese people's liberation as his own cause. What spirit is this? This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every member of the Communist Party of China must learn this spirit." Chairman Mao's words seemed to be directed at him, making him realize that serving the people is a lifelong matter and absolutely cannot be done for a while and then demand this and that from the people. He said, people's lives will indeed encounter various changes, but no matter how much they change, serving the people must always remain unchanged. Serving the revolution by driving a train for a lifetime is the greatest happiness.

Once, old driver Guo Yingfu was driving to the Nancang Station near Tianjin. At that time, the duty officer was assigning a slow-point train. Pulling a slow-point train means longer working hours and affects the crew's rest. As soon as the duty officer saw Guo Yingfu, he handed over this heavy task to him. Guo Yingfu noticed that there were two other locomotives in front of him, and according to the regulations, the locomotive that arrived first should pull the train first. So, he blurted out, "Isn't it first come, first served?" As soon as the words left his mouth, he thought of the honor of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive and accepted the task of pulling the slow-point train. Back at the section, Guo Yingfu immediately checked his own wrong thoughts at the small group meeting. He said, "This time, taking on the heavy task, I was purely considering the reputation of the small collective, which is actually an exaggerated form of individualism." At that time, some young crew members in the group did not think much of it and said, "Although the words were said, the work was still done, so it doesn't matter!" In response to this active thought, Driver Long Cai Lianxing organized everyone to restudy Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" and related quotations on serving the people. Chairman Mao said, "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; everything starts from the interests of the people, not from the interests of individuals or small groups; ... these are our starting points." Everyone, following Chairman Mao's teachings, linked their various private thoughts that surfaced when taking on heavy tasks and conducted self-examinations. Through discussion, everyone deeply realized that daring to take on heavy tasks is a reflection of two worldviews, and under what thoughts to take on heavy tasks is also a reflection of two worldviews. Taking on heavy tasks with "private" interests will make one's consciousness lower and private thoughts heavier. Only by taking on heavy tasks with "public" interests and starting from the interests of the people can one's consciousness be higher.

The old workers' strict use of Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls has influenced the growth of new workers. One summer, Guo Yingfu was driving to Nancang and encountered a torrential rain. Leaning out the window to watch the train signals, the raindrops hit his face like small stones. But he kept thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and insisted on watching. Zhou Hongqiao, a vice driver who had just come to this locomotive, shrank back into the car as soon as he encountered the rain. At that moment, Zhou Hongqiao saw Guo Yingfu still motionless, leaning out the left window, watching the front. Zhou Hongqiao's heart trembled, and he immediately imitated Guo Yingfu's posture, leaning out the window, steadfastly watching the front, more attentive than usual to prevent possible accidents in the rain. Another summer, new fireman Wang Qingfeng's first day on the job coincided with a heavy rain. This time, he saw Zhou Hongqiao standing in the pouring rain, soaked to the skin, meticulously guiding the locomotive to turn around in the yard. This scene left a deep impression on Wang Qingfeng. He said, "The foremen's most fundamental principle is to listen to Chairman Mao's words and dedicate themselves to the revolution. One must treat stoking the fire as doing the revolution, and the fundamental principle is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's own thoughts." Wang Qingfeng grew and was tempered in this revolutionary furnace of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive and was evaluated as an excellent fireman.

From old driver Guo Yingfu to vice driver Zhou Hongqiao to new fireman Wang Qingfeng, they have passed down Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation in this way.

Driver Long Cai Lianxing said: In the future, we will better use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our souls, give the "self" and "private" interests a dead stop, sentence them to death, and thoroughly crush and grind them out of our heads!

Forever be the vanguard

The crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive say, "Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. We have made up our minds and held it high. We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, driving the revolutionary train, forever on the track guided by Chairman Mao, full steam ahead!"

The crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew, with strong class feelings, defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend the Party, and defend socialism. In class struggles, they are brave fighters of the proletariat, and in production struggles and scientific experiments, they are also at the forefront.

Over the past 20 years, the comrades of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive have not only overcome the various difficulties brought by wind, snow, rain, and fog in driving trains but have also, with the revolutionary spirit of "facing the wind," always been at the forefront and vanguard in the face of new things, achieving one victory after another.

The source of the "facing the wind" spirit comes from Mao Zedong Thought. They have felt from their own struggles that with Mao Zedong Thought, any risk can be taken, and any difficulty can be overcome.

During the Great Leap Forward in 1959, there was a sharp contradiction between railway transportation capacity and volume. To solve this contradiction, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot universally replaced the "Construction Type" domestically produced locomotives, which can pull more and run faster, on the Jingshan Line. The "Mao Zedong" is an old locomotive. To pull the same weight of goods, even with full effort, the speed is still far behind.

This is a severe test. Many crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive were worried about this issue: Can the old locomotive still run? Can it catch up with the new "Construction Type"? They looked up at the "Mao Zedong" four golden characters on their locomotive, as if standing by Chairman Mao's side. The glorious name of the great leader gave them endless strength. They opened Chairman Mao's works, consulted Chairman Mao's works, and sought answers from Chairman Mao's works. After studying "Qu Yuan Moves Mountains," they gathered courage and confidence, saying, "Since Yu Gong can move mountains, why can't the locomotive be changed? We have made up our minds to move mountains like Yu Gong and decided to catch up with the 'Construction Type.'"

Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction," "All contradictions transform into their opposites under certain conditions." They were inspired and encouraged by this teaching of Chairman Mao, determined to transform this old locomotive and let it catch up with the "Construction Type."

Their determination was supported and encouraged by the leadership. The section sent technical personnel and fitters to work with them to transform the locomotive. To understand the performance of the "Construction Type" locomotive, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "No investigation, no right to speak," while flipping through the drawings, they also compared their own locomotive with the "Construction Type" locomotive in practice, found the gaps, and through the joint efforts of scientific and technical personnel and factory foremen, carried out dozens of major technical transformations on the locomotive, finally making the locomotive's transportation capacity catch up with the "Construction Type."

One test passed, and another test came before them.

Last year, the crew members on the locomotive had a debate about using the coal-feeding machine. The coal-feeding machine is a substitute for manual coal-feeding. At the beginning, they were not familiar with its rules, and it was easy to waste coal. At the beginning of the month, everyone was happy to use it, but by the middle of the month, seeing that the coal-saving target could not be completed, they immediately switched back to manual coal-feeding. Sometimes, seeing that other locomotives did not use the coal-feeding machine and their coal-saving achievements exceeded their own, they simply put down the coal-feeding machine and did not use it.

How should they treat this new technology?

The crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew took this question and seriously studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice." Repeated study and discussion made them understand a truth more deeply: The red flag must be held high in advance and in struggle; the red flag itself means daring to practice and daring to innovate.

Under this ideological guidance, the drivers, vice drivers, and firemen of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive once again insisted on the spirit of "facing the wind." They conducted dozens of experiments and humbly sought advice from other locomotives, finally mastering the new technology of using the coal-feeding machine skillfully.

In the process of advancing, old contradictions are solved, and new contradictions arise. This year, the transportation volume at the station increased sharply, and the Ministry of Railways required the "Mao Zedong" locomotive to take the lead in experimenting with long-distance operation from Fengtai to Shanhaiguan to improve transportation efficiency. Steam freight locomotives running 400 kilometers at a time is unprecedented in the history of Chinese locomotives. At the beginning, some crew members thought the distance was long, the route was unfamiliar, and they were afraid of accidents and worried about not being able to run.

Should they avoid difficulties or "face the wind"? They once again reviewed Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" and unanimously decided to "resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They investigated the situation of bridges, slopes, and signal settings along the line, specially formulated a route map indicating where to run fast and where to pay special attention, and then drove forward, successfully realizing the long-distance operation between Fengtai and Shanhaiguan, increasing the locomotive's transportation efficiency by one-third, and adding a new page to the history of red flag locomotives.

The crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, in the practice of overcoming difficulties, deeply felt that on the revolutionary road, although there are many difficulties, as long as one's mind is armed with Mao Zedong Thought, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Overcoming each difficulty means advancing one step. The road of continuous revolution is the road of continuously using Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's own thoughts, continuously recognizing and mastering objective laws, continuously overcoming difficulties, and advancing.

Advancing with the two-line struggle

The "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew has done many great things for the Party and the people, always holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, striving to promote the ideological revolution of the people, and is a flag in the national railway system. The Party and the state have given them praise and rewards time and time again. In the face of honor, some crew members' minds have grown a layer of complacency. It was Mao Zedong Thought that cleared away this layer of fog in their minds, and they used the two-line struggle method taught by Chairman Mao to advance in the struggle.

Once, a locomotive performance competition was held in Baoding, and the "Mao Zedong" won first place. The news reached Fengtai, and the crew members were waiting for the driver to return to discuss the competition results in detail. However, when Cai Lianxing returned from the competition, his first words were, "Our car still needs to be polished well." He opened his notebook and listed the advanced deeds of the brother locomotives one by one. Some people couldn't stand it anymore and reminded him, "We got first place, didn't we?" Cai Lianxing said, "That's right, we got first place. This first place is an 80-point first place, far from a perfect score, what's there to boast about!" As soon as the words were finished, someone interrupted, "No matter how many points, it's still first place." At this time, Cai Lianxing opened "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume 3, Page 1013, and loudly read a passage: "You have many strengths and great merits, but you must remember not to be arrogant. You are respected by everyone, which is appropriate, but it is also easy to become arrogant. If you become arrogant, you will not be humble, you will not work hard, you will not respect others, you will not respect cadres, you will not respect the masses, and you will no longer be a hero or a model. There have been some people like this in the past, and I hope you will not learn from them." Chairman Mao's teachings made the group members wake up, and many people voluntarily dug out the roots of arrogance and complacency. The entire crew immediately compared their own shortcomings with the advanced deeds of others and quickly found their direction of effort.

However, the real test in the face of honor is yet to come.

In recent years, railway departments from all over the country have come to the "Mao Zedong" locomotive to "learn from it." Once, crew members from an out-of-town locomotive depot boarded their locomotive to learn about their experience in maintaining locomotives. A crew member used an iron wire to dig out a bit of oil dirt from the small oil box of the locomotive, indicating that the maintenance of the locomotive was not thorough enough. At this time, some crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive thought this was nitpicking. In response to this emerging active thought, they immediately organized everyone to review Chairman Mao's teachings in "Serve the People" and "Organize." Through study and discussion, everyone timely realized that having achievements but fearing criticism is not daring to demand high standards of oneself, which is not following Chairman Mao's teachings of the two-line struggle to look at problems. Not using the two-line struggle, not emphasizing one is two, and letting two eat one, one cannot see one's own shortcomings and will fall behind. Therefore, the entire crew immediately took action, learning the method of using an iron wire to dig out oil dirt, thoroughly eliminating the oil dirt in some small oil boxes that could not be reached.

In 1964, the Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the Communist Party of China's Ministry of Railways awarded them a banner reading "Insist on continuous revolution, forever be the vanguard," and the Party Committee of the Ministry of Railways decided to further promote the experience of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew nationwide, calling on all railway workers to learn from the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew. Facing this honor, everyone felt it was both an encouragement and a spur, but also had the idea of "protecting" the honor. At that time, they thought, the 18-year safe driving record of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive was created through thousands of hardships, and it must be protected and absolutely not lost from their hands. Once the idea of fearing to lose honor emerged in their minds, their energy was concentrated on "protecting," and the "fear" in their minds also increased, and they were no longer daring to think, dare to do, dare to innovate, and dare to create. As a result, some aspects of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew fell behind the brother crews.

At this time, they suddenly realized. They reviewed "On Contradiction" and found the cause. By comparing with Chairman Mao's teachings, they realized that the reason for falling behind in some aspects was that they had not mastered the law of the unity of opposites, and because of the "protect" first, they had not actively made the contradictions realize revolutionary transformation, which could not keep up with the development of the objective situation, and as a result, they wanted to protect but could not protect it. From this, they deeply realized that doing revolution must dare to innovate and create, and having personal杂念 and small groupism thoughts would not be able to thoroughly revolutionize. After getting rid of the "fear," they took the lead in practicing the hard skills of stopping the train once at the station and the fast, accurate, stable, and economical locomotive operation method, practicing the hard technology of working in the dark at night in case of war, and took the lead in successfully experimenting with the new technology of washing and maintaining steam locomotives for 10,000 kilometers. Mao Zedong Thought made them brave and wise, and as a result, they created new achievements and made new contributions.

In the practice of using the two-line struggle to fight against arrogance and complacency and the single-minded idea of protecting honor, they realized: arrogance and complacency and the single-minded idea of protecting honor are a relatively stubborn force. Overcoming and defeating it is a struggle of eliminating bourgeois ideology and establishing proletarian ideology in the ideological realm. Through long-term tempering and education, they have gradually cultivated such a quality, or such an atmosphere: every period of time, they sit down and review Chairman Mao's instructions on preventing arrogance and complacency, give each other some advice, and prevent and eliminate problems in their infancy. Every time they are praised, they calm down and find their weak links with high standards. If other locomotives have an accident, they study it seriously and learn from the lessons as if it were their own. If other locomotives have one skill, they humbly seek advice. If other locomotives encounter difficulties, they help others to catch up with themselves without any personal gain.

All crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew are determined to forever use the weapon of the two-line struggle, making themselves forever invincible. On October 30, at the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the naming of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive held in Beijing, Driver Long Cai Lianxing, on behalf of all crew members, expressed their determination to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently and seriously, to advance bravely on the track guided by Mao Zedong Thought, and to let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the "Mao Zedong" locomotive!

    听毛主席的话　开革命的列车
    ——记“毛泽东号”机车包车组不断改造思想不断前进的二十年
    “毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，在“毛泽东号”机车命名二十周年之际，亲笔作了这样的题词。
    林彪同志的题词，是对全国人民的巨大鼓舞！
    林彪同志的题词，是对全国铁路职工的最大关怀！
    林彪同志的题词，是对“毛泽东号”机车包车组的最高奖赏！
    以我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的光辉名字命名的“毛泽东号”机车，从一九四六年十月诞生起，到现在已经整整二十年了。在解放战争年代的支前运输线上，在抗美援朝的后勤运输线上，在社会主义建设的繁忙运输线上，在人民革命的一段漫长的历史道路上，“毛泽东号”机车滚滚向前！“毛泽东号”机车的司机长更迭了五任，乘务员相继调出了七十多个；但是，“毛泽东号”机车包车组，始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗勇往直前！“毛泽东号”机车不只是北京铁路局的一个火车头，它也是全国铁路系统一面光辉的旗帜，一个先行的火车头！
    二十年来，“毛泽东号”机车包车组的同志们，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席和对毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的深厚的阶级感情，认真地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，忠实地照毛主席的指示办事，争当毛主席的好战士、好工人。他们用毛泽东思想斗“我”字，破“私”字，抵制各种剥削阶级思想的侵蚀，刻苦地改造自己的主观世界，努力树立一心为革命，“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想。
    二十年来，他们把毛泽东思想一代一代地传了下来，把革命的光荣传统一代一代地发扬光大，培养了一代又一代的革命战士。这个仅有十来名乘务员的包车组，为国家输送了三十多名干部和一大批红色工人。
    二十年来，他们一直发扬了带头顶风上，一路打先锋的革命精神，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争风浪里，爱憎分明，立场坚定，站得稳，顶得住，始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，站在斗争的最前列，勇敢地向一切阶级敌人进行了不调和的斗争。在生产斗争和科学实验中，他们把一台旧机车改造成先进机车。他们经受住了各种困难和荣誉的考验，实现了多拉、快跑、安全、节煤全面红，创造了我国铁路安全运行一百九十三万公里的史无前例的新纪录。
    他们用全部心血写的机车历史，闪耀着伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。人们赞誉他们：不愧是以毛泽东思想武装起来的战斗集体，不愧是战斗在铁路运输线上的革命火车头，无愧于它的光荣名字“毛泽东号”。
    轧碎“我”字、“私”字
    “毛泽东号”机车包车组有这么一个传统：每逢新工人上车，组里同志们送给他的第一件最珍贵的礼物，就是“老三篇”等毛主席著作。在这台机车上，人人有一套《毛泽东选集》。他们经常带在身边，走到那里学到那里，学了就用。用他们的话说，是“宝书不离身，思想不离根”，就是言行不离毛泽东思想的“根”，也就是用毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想，用毛泽东思想来指导自己的行动。
    长期以来，他们坚持每年一次或两次小整风，紧紧围绕着“为谁劳动”、“为谁开火车”这个根本问题，开展批评与自我批评，破私立公，破旧立新，狠抓世界观的改造。特别是从一九六四年开始，他们把毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇光辉著作，作为座右铭来学，作为改造灵魂的强大思想武器来学，作为培养共产主义新人的最根本的必修课来学。
    司机长蔡连兴，狠抓自己的思想改造，在同私心杂念作斗争中，敢于刺刀见红。他在每次学习毛主席著作的讲用会上，总是带头亮思想，挖根源，谈体会，取得大家的督促和帮助，同时也带动了全组的思想革命。他常常是干完一件工作，就斗一次思想，连一闪而过的错误思想也不放松。有一次，蔡连兴在车站等候拉一列直达货车，正遇上调度车辆的机车忙不过来。车站值班员要他帮忙调车。蔡连兴一看表，感到时间紧迫，怕耽误正点开车。当时他脑子里闪过一个念头：他想到自己是司机长，如果不帮忙，人家会说自己风格不高的。于是，他马上开动自己的机车，用最快速度调完了车。车站值班员冲着他满意地说：“到底是‘毛泽东号’的风格高！”当天晚上，蔡连兴并没有因为受到表扬而放松自己。他针对白天一闪而过的错误思想，专门学习了《为人民服务》，用“完全”、“彻底”两把尺子量自己，越量越感到脸上发烧。他抓住这个活思想，联系到自己在为人民做好事的时候，思想上有时还冒出争名、争出风头的私心杂念。他就在小组会上，亮出思想，作了检讨，使毛泽东思想在头脑里扎根又扎深了一分。
    三代工人出身的老司机胡春东，在这台机车上由烧火到开车，已经勤勤恳恳干了将近二十年。同他一起工作的两名副司机，先后当了段长和科长，他思想上曾经出现过波动。有人说：“人家都升了，就剩下胡春东这位五代元老啦！”他听到这样的议论，心里总觉得有点不得劲。他带着这个问题，打开《纪念白求恩》，几行金光闪闪的大字闪耀在他眼前：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他
  自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。”毛主席的话，好像就是针对他说的，使他认识到，为人民服务，是一辈子的事情，绝不能干一阵就向人民要这要那。他说，人的一生中，确实会遇到这样那样的变动，但是千变万变，为人民服务要永远不变。为革命开一辈子火车，这就是最大幸福。
    有一次，老司机郭映福跑车到天津附近的南仓车站。当时，值班员正在分配一列慢点列车。拉慢点列车，作业时间长，影响乘务员的休息。值班员一看到郭映福，就把这个重担交给了他。郭映福发现在他前面还有两台机车，按照规定先到的机车应当先拉。于是，他冲口而出地说：“不是挨个儿走吗？”话刚落音，他想起了“毛泽东号”机车的荣誉，就把慢点列车的任务接受下来了。回到段上，郭映福立即在小组会上主动检查了自己的错误思想。他说：“这次挑重担，我是单纯考虑了小集体的名声才去挑的，这实际上是放大了的个人风头主义。”当时，小组里有些年轻乘务员不以为然地说：“话儿虽然说了，但是活儿还是干了，这算不了什么！”针对这个活思想，司机长蔡连兴便组织大家重新学习毛主席的“老三篇”和有关为人民服务的语录。毛主席说：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；……这些就是我们的出发点。”大家按照毛主席的教导，联系自己在挑重担时曾经冒出来的各种各样私心杂念进行检查。经过讨论，大家深刻地认识到，敢不敢挑重担是两种世界观的反映，在什么思想指导下去挑重担子，也是两种世界观的反映。带着“私”字去挑重担子，越挑思想觉悟越低，私心杂念也会越重。只有带着“公”字去挑重担，一切从人民的利益出发，才能越挑觉悟越高。
    老工人严格地用毛泽东思想改造自己灵魂的事迹，时时事事影响着新工人的成长。有一年夏天，郭映福有一次开车去南仓，遇到一场瓢泼大雨，探身窗外了望行车信号，雨点打在脸上，就像被小石子打的一样痛。但他一心想着毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，一直坚持了望。才来这台机车不久的副司机周洪桥，一遇到大雨，却把探在右面车窗外了望的半个身子往里一缩。就在这个时候，周洪桥瞧见郭映福仍然一动不动地探身在左面车窗外了望。周洪桥心中一震，立即学着郭映福的样子，又探身窗外巍然不动地了望着前方，比平时格外专心地提防大雨中可能发生的事故。又一年的夏天，新司炉王庆丰第一天上车，凑巧也遇到一场暴雨。这回，是他看到周洪桥站在倾盆大雨中浑身湿透，一丝不苟地在车场引导机车调头。这情景给王庆丰留下了难忘的印象。他说：“老师傅们最根本的是听毛主席的话，一心为革命。自己要把烧火当作是干革命，根本一条是用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想。”王庆丰在“毛泽东号”机车这个革命熔炉里锻炼成长，曾被评为“五好”司炉工人。
    从老司机郭映福，到副司机周洪桥，到新司炉王庆丰，他们就是这样把毛泽东思想代代相传的。
    司机长蔡连兴说：今后我们要更好地用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，给“我”字“私”字撂死闸，判死刑，把“我”字“私”字从脑袋瓜子里干干净净地挖出来，用钢轮彻底轧烂轧碎！
    永当开路先锋
    “毛泽东号”机车的乘务员们说：“毛泽东思想是胜利的旗帜，我们是认定了，举定了。我们要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，开着革命的列车，永远在毛主席指引的轨道上，加足马力前进！”
    “毛泽东号”机车包车组的乘务人员，以强烈的阶级感情捍卫毛主席，捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫党，捍卫社会主义。他们在阶级斗争中，是无产阶级的勇敢战士，在生产斗争和科学实验中，也一路打先锋。
    二十年来，“毛泽东号”机车的同志们，不仅战胜了自然界风、雪、雨、雾给开火车带来的各种困难，而且以“顶风上”的革命精神，在新事物面前一直是打先锋、闯头阵，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    “顶风上”精神的源泉来自毛泽东思想。他们从自己斗争的实践中体会到：有了毛泽东思想，任何风险都敢闯，任何困难都能克服。
    在一九五九年大跃进的日子里，铁路运输能力和运输量发生了尖锐的矛盾。为了解决这一矛盾，丰台机务段担当的京山线普遍换上了拉得多、跑得快的国产“建设型”机车。“毛泽东号”是老车，要拉同样重的货，即使用劲跑，速度也还差一大截。
    这是一个严峻的考验。“毛泽东号”机车不少的乘务员，都焦心地思索着这个问题：老机车到底还能不能跑？能不能赶上新的“建设型”？他们抬头看见自己火车头上的“毛泽东号”四个金字，就像站在毛主席的身边，伟大领袖的光辉名字给了他们无穷无尽的力量。他们翻开毛主席著作，向毛主席著作请教，从毛主席著作中寻找答案。他们学习了《愚公移山》之后，鼓起了勇气，充满信心地说：“既然愚公能移山，何愁机车不能改，立下愚公移山志，决心赶上‘建设型’。”
    毛主席在《矛盾论》中说：“一切矛盾都依一定条件向它们的反面转化着”。他们从毛主席这一教导中，得到启发和鼓舞，下定决心要改造好这台老机车，让它赶上“建设型”。
    他们的决心得到领导上的支持和鼓励。段上派了技术人员和钳工，同他们一起改造机车。为了弄清“建设型”机车的性能，他们按照毛主席“没有调查就没有发言权”的教导，一面翻阅图纸，一面把自己的机车与“建设型”机车进行实际比较，找出差距，经过科学技术人员和工厂老师傅们的共同努力，对机车进行了几十项较大的技术改造，终于使机车的运输能力赶上了“建设型”。
    一个考验过去，又一个考验来到他们面前。
    去年，机车上的乘务人员对使用加煤机，引起了一场思想斗争。加煤机，是代替人工加煤的。开始的时候，尚未摸到它的规律，用起来容易费煤。月初大家还喜欢用它，到月中，一看节约煤炭的指标完不成，又立即改用人工加煤。有时，看到别的机车不用加煤机，节约煤炭的成绩超过自己，就干脆搁下加煤机不用了。
    怎样对待这项新技术呢？
    “毛泽东号”机车包车组的乘务员们带着这个问题，认真地学习了毛主席的《实践论》。反复的学习，反复的议论，使他们更加懂得这样一个道理：红旗必须在前进中在斗争中高高举起；红旗本身就意味着勇于实践，勇于革新。
    在这种思想指导下，“毛泽东号”机车的司机、副司机和司炉们又一次坚持了“顶风上”的精神。他们进行了几十次试验，同时虚心地向别的机车求教，终于熟练地掌握了使用加煤机的新技术。
    在前进的道路中，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又产生了。今年，车站运输量猛增，铁道部要求“毛泽东号”机车带头试验从丰台到山海关的长距离运行，来提高运输效率。蒸汽货运机车，一下子跑四百公里，这在我国机车史上还是第一次。开始，有些乘务员认为运距长，路不熟，怕出事故，耽心跑不了。
    是回避困难，还是“顶风上”？他们又一次温习毛主席的“老三篇”，一致表示要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们调查了沿线桥梁、坡道、信号设置的情况，专门制订了注明哪里该快跑，哪里该特别注意的行车线路图，然后开车前进，成功地实现了从丰台到山海关之间的长距离运行，使这台机车的运输效率提高了三分之一，在红旗机车史上又写下了新的一页。
    “毛泽东号”机车的乘务员们在不断克服困难的实践中，深深地体会到：革命的路上，困难虽然多，只要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，就没有克服不了的困难。每克服一个困难，就能前进一步。不断革命的道路，就是不断用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想，不断认识与掌握客观规律，不断战胜困难，继续前进的道路。
    用两分法前进
    “毛泽东号”机车包车组为党为人民立了许许多多功劳，一直高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力促进人的思想革命化，是全国铁路系统的一面旗帜。党和国家给了他们一次又一次的表扬和奖励。在荣誉面前，有些乘务员头脑里，曾经滋长起一层自满的障翳。是毛泽东思想拨开了他们思想上的这层障翳，他们运用毛主席教导的两分法，在斗争中前进了。
    有一次，在保定举行了一次机车性能比武大会，“毛泽东号”荣获第一。消息传到丰台，组里的乘务员等着司机长回来详细谈谈评比结果。可是，蔡连兴比武归来，见面第一句话却是：“咱们的车，还得好好地擦。”他翻开小本子，一一数说起兄弟机车的先进事迹。有些人耐不住了，当场提醒他一句：“咱们不是得了第一吗？”蔡连兴说：“不错，是第一。这个第一，是八十分的第一，离开满分还有一截，有什么值得夸耀的！”话刚说完，有人插嘴说：“不管多少分，反正是第一。”这时，蔡连兴翻开《毛泽东选集》第三卷一○一三页，大声朗读上面的一段话：“你们有许多的长处，有很大的功劳，但是你们切记不可以骄傲。你们被大家尊敬，是应当的，但是也容易因此引起骄傲。如果你们骄傲起来，不虚心，不再努力，不尊重人家，不尊重干部，不尊重群众，你们就会当不成英雄和模范了。过去已有一些这样的人，希望你们不要学他们。”毛主席的教导，使小组同志清醒起来，许多人自觉地挖出了骄傲自满的根子。全组乘务员立即拿人家的先进事迹，对比自己的不足之处，迅速找到了自己的努力方向。
    但是，在荣誉面前的真正考验，还在后头。
    近些年来，全国铁路部门络绎不绝地来到“毛泽东号”机车上“取经”。有一次，外地机务段的乘务员登上他们的机车，向他们学习保养机车的经验。有一个乘务员，用铁丝砸的勺，在机车的小油盒里挖出了一点油泥，说明机车保养还不够到家。这时，“毛泽东号”机车有些乘务员认为这种做法是在鸡蛋里挑骨头。针对这个刚露头的活思想，马上组织大家重温毛主席在《为人民服务》和《组织起来》两篇文章中的教导。经过学习讨论，大家及时地认识到，有了成绩怕批评，就是不敢用高标准要求自己，就是没有按照毛主席教导的两分法去看问题。不用两分法，不讲究一分为二，用一把二给吃掉了，就看不见自己的缺点，就会落后。于是，全组立即动手，学习人家用铁丝勺掏挖油泥的方法，彻底消除了车上一些进不去手的小油盒里的油泥。
    一九六四年，铁道部和中共铁道部政治部授给他们一面“坚持不断革命，永当开路先锋”的奖旗，铁道部党委还做出了在全国进一步推广“毛泽东号”机车包车组经验的决定，号召全路职工向“毛泽东号”机车包车组学习。面对这个荣誉，大家一面感到这是对自己的鼓舞和鞭策，一面也产生了“保”荣誉的想法。当时他们心想，“毛泽东号”机车安全行车十八年的业绩，是经过千辛万苦创造出来的，一定得保住，决不能从我们这里丢掉。思想上一旦产生了这种怕丢掉荣誉的想法，精力就集中在“保”字上了，脑子里的“怕”字也多起来了，也就不是敢想敢干、敢闯敢创的了。结果，“毛泽东号”机车包车组有些方面落在兄弟包车组的后面了。
    这时，他们才猛然一惊。他们重温《矛盾论》，从中找原因。用毛主席的教导一对照，他们才认识到某些方面所以落后，正是因为没有掌握矛盾对立统一的规律，由于“保”字当头，没有积极使矛盾实现革命的转化，这就不能紧紧随着客观形势的发展而发展，结果想保也保不住了。从这里，他们深刻地认识到，干革命就得敢闯敢创，有个人杂念，有小集体主义思想，就不能彻底革命。去掉了“怕”字之后，他们又带头练习了列车进站一次停妥的过硬本领和快、准、稳、省的机车操纵法，练出了夜间能在无灯光下坚持作业的以备战时需要的过硬技术，还带头试验成功蒸汽机车一万公里洗检保养的新技术。毛泽东思想使他们勇敢起来，聪明起来，结果又创造了新的成绩，做出了新的贡献。
    在运用两分法与骄傲自满和单纯保荣誉的思想做斗争的实践中，他们认识到：骄傲自满和单纯保荣誉的思想，是一种相当顽固的势力。克服它、战胜它，就是意识形态领域内的灭资兴无的斗争。他们经过长期的磨炼教育，已经逐渐养成这样一种品质，或者说这样一种风气：每隔一个时间，就坐下来重温毛主席有关防止骄傲自满的指示，相互提提意见，防微杜渐。每当受到表扬，就冷静下来，用高标准找一找自己的薄弱环节。别的机车出了什么事故，他们也像自己出了事故一样，立即认真研究，吸取教训。别的机车那怕有一技之长，他们也要虚心求教。别的机车发生了困难，他们就毫无私心地、诚心诚意地帮助别人赶上自己。
    “毛泽东号”机车包车组全体乘务员，决心永远运用两分法这个武器，使自己永远立于不败之地。十月三十日，在北京举行的“毛泽东号”机车命名二十周年庆祝大会上，司机长蔡连兴代表包车组全体乘务员表示，决心响应林彪同志的号召，更加刻苦地、更加认真地活学活用毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想指引的轨道上勇往直前，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在“毛泽东号”火车头上永远高高飘扬！
