The revolutionary tradition of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The people of Yan'an celebrate the opening of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University History Exhibition.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, XI'AN, NOVEMBER 17 - The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University History Exhibition officially opened on November 15 at the former site of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an. The people of Yan'an, filled with revolutionary fervor, held a grand gathering on this day to celebrate the opening of this exhibition, which shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Red Guards from all over the country who came to Yan'an for revolutionary linkage, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots visiting Yan'an, and foreign friends attended the meeting.

This exhibition was organized under the leadership and care of the Central Military Commission by relevant departments after more than a year of preparation. Hundreds of precious revolutionary relics, pictures, and materials provide a comprehensive and vivid introduction to this most advanced, revolutionary, and progressive school that grew under the direct leadership and care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

The people of Yan'an specially wrote a letter to the beloved leader Chairman Mao to celebrate the opening of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University History Exhibition in Yan'an. The letter said, "The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University is one you personally founded, a school that is completely in accordance with your educational thoughts, the most advanced, revolutionary, and progressive school, and a model for proletarian education. The people of Yan'an will forever follow your teachings of 'carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory,' resolutely defend and carry out your proletarian revolutionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. We will definitely take the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example and turn Yan'an into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, so that the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will forever fly high in Yan'an."

The people of Yan'an, in batches, visited the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University History Exhibition. Many people, moved, said: Holding such an exhibition in the place where Chairman Mao fought for a long time, in the former site of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, is of particularly great significance. This is a new victory in the deepening development of the Cultural Revolution and a great joy in the political life of our people.

Walking into the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University History Exhibition Hall is like walking into the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University of that time, feeling particularly familiar. Some Red Guard warriors, after visiting the exhibition, wrote in large letters, "Long live the revolutionary spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University!" They said: The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University is our model and direction. We will learn from the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, follow the path of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, inherit the tradition and style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and pass it down from generation to generation. We will turn our schools into Mao Zedong Thought universities in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.

    延安人民欢庆抗大校史展览开幕
    新华社西安十七日电　抗大校史展览十五日在延安抗大总校校部旧址正式展出。延安人民满怀革命豪情，在这一天隆重举行集会，欢庆这一闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的抗大校史展览的开幕。全国各地来延安进行革命串连的红卫兵和革命师生，正在延安参观访问的港澳同胞以及外国朋友出席了大会。
    这个展览是在中央军委的领导和关怀下，由有关部门经过一年多的筹备办起来的。数百件珍贵的革命文物、图片和资料，对这所在党中央、毛主席直接领导和关怀下成长的最新型、最革命、最进步的学校，作了全面的、生动的介绍。
    延安人民为庆祝抗大校史展览在延安开幕，专门给敬爱的领袖毛主席写了一封信。信中说，抗大是您亲自缔造的，是完全按照您的教育思想办起来的最新型、最革命、最进步的学校，是无产阶级教育事业的样板。延安人民永远遵循您的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，誓死捍卫和执行您的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，坚决以抗大为榜样，把延安办成毛泽东思想的大学校，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远在延安高高飘扬。
    延安人民一批又一批参观了抗大校史展览，许多人激动地说：在毛主席长期战斗过的地方，在抗大旧址举办这样的展览，具有特别重大的意义，这是无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的新胜利，是我国人民政治生活中的一件大喜事。
    走进延安抗大校史展览馆，就像走进当年的抗大一样，感到格外亲切。有些红卫兵战士参观了展览，挥笔写下了“抗大革命精神万岁！”几个大字，他们说：抗大是我们的榜样，是我们的方向。我们要学抗大，走抗大的道路，把抗大的传统、作风接过来，世世代代传下去。把我们的学校，办成抗大式的毛泽东思想大学校。
