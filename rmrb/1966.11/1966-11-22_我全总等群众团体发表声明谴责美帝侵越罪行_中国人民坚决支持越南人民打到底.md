The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement today, firmly supporting the just stance of the Vietnam Democratic Republic's Committee for the Investigation of U.S. Imperialist War Crimes in Vietnam, severely condemning the heinous crimes of U.S. aggression against Vietnam, and supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The statement said that numerous pieces of evidence show that U.S. imperialism is the most brutal war criminal of the contemporary world, even more so than the Hitler fascists of yesteryears.

The statement emphasized that while U.S. imperialism is escalating the war in Vietnam, it is also shamelessly playing the "peace talks" trick, using the threat of expanded war to push its "peace talks" conspiracy, and using the "peace talks" smokescreen to cover up its war crimes. The great traitors of the international labor movement, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, are actively serving U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" conspiracy. The conspiracy of U.S.-Soviet collusion to extinguish the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation will never succeed. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique's attempt to betray the Vietnamese people's revolution is doomed to failure.

The statement finally solemnly declared that the workers and people of China and Vietnam are brothers who share weal and woe. Chinese workers have made all preparations. No matter how far U.S. imperialism expands the war, no matter what risks we have to face, we are determined to make every sacrifice and pay any price to firmly support the Vietnamese workers and people in carrying out their just war against U.S. aggression for national salvation to the end. Chinese workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will forever stand with the heroic Vietnamese people.

The All-China Women's Federation issued a statement today, strongly condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. The statement said that U.S. imperialism has committed heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people and has a blood debt to pay. U.S. imperialism is the greatest war criminal of the contemporary world. Chinese women are most indignant at the crimes of U.S. imperialism.

The statement said that the Vietnamese people are a great people who stand tall and firm, who cannot be intimidated or deceived. They have, with their actual actions of bravely fighting the enemy and resolutely fighting to the end, shattered the various conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism. The Vietnamese people will certainly continue to fight on, holding high the banner of victory across all of Vietnam.

The statement finally said that Chinese women, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, together with all the people of China, are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people in thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors.

The responsible persons of the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation issued a statement today, angrily denouncing the crimes of U.S. imperialism, the common enemy of all the people of the world and the greatest war criminal of the contemporary world, against the Vietnamese people, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and supporting the statement of the Vietnam Democratic Republic's Committee for the Investigation of U.S. Imperialist War Crimes in Vietnam.

The two responsible persons pointed out that recently, the head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, personally convened the so-called Manila "Seven-Nation Summit," playing both revolutionary and counter-revolutionary hands on the Vietnam issue, and actively pushing the "war for peace" conspiracy. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is also actively working, serving U.S. imperialism's conspiracy on the Vietnam issue, and actively acting as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. Whether it is U.S. imperialism or modern revisionism, they will not escape the punishment of history and the fate of thorough failure.

The responsible persons of the Youth Federation and the Students' Federation finally said that we Chinese youth and students, following the teachings of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, together with all the people of the nation, vow to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end!

    我全总等群众团体发表声明谴责美帝侵越罪行
    中国人民坚决支持越南人民打到底
    据新华社二十一日讯　中华全国总工会今天发表声明，坚决支持越南民主共和国调查美帝国主义在越南的战争罪行委员会声明的正义立场，严厉谴责美帝侵略越南的滔天罪行，支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。声明说，无数罪证表明，美帝国主义是比当年希特勒法西斯匪徒更加残暴的当代最大的战争罪犯。
    声明强调指出，美帝国主义一方面在越南加紧战争“升级”，另一方面大肆玩弄“和谈”骗局，用扩大战争的讹诈来推行“和谈”阴谋，又用“和谈”烟幕来掩盖扩大战争的罪行。国际工人运动的大叛徒苏联修正主义领导集团为美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋大力效劳。美苏共同策划扑灭越南人民的抗美救国战争的阴谋是绝不能得逞的。苏联修正主义领导集团妄图出卖越南人民的革命是绝对办不到的。
    声明最后庄严表示，中越两国工人和人民是患难与共的亲密兄弟。中国工人已经作好了一切准备，不管美帝国主义把战争扩大到什么地步，不管要冒什么风险，我们决心不惜一切牺牲和代价，坚决支持越南工人和人民把抗美救国的正义战争进行到底。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人永远和英雄的越南人民站在一起。
    据新华社二十一日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义侵略越南的罪行。声明说，美帝国主义对越南人民犯下了滔天罪行，欠下了累累血债。美帝国主义是当代最大的战争罪犯。中国妇女最愤怒地谴责美帝国主义的罪行。
    声明说，越南人民是顶天立地的伟大的人民，是吓不倒也骗不了的，他们用英勇杀敌、坚决战斗到底的实际行动，粉碎了美帝国主义和现代修正主义的各种阴谋诡计。越南人民一定能够再接再厉，坚持战斗，把胜利的旗帜插遍全越南。
    声明最后说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国妇女，和全中国人民一起，决心不惜作出最大民族牺牲，全力支援越南人民，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    据新华社二十一日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会负责人今天发表谈话，愤怒声讨全世界人民的死敌、当代最大的战争罪犯——美帝国主义对越南人民犯下的滔天罪行，坚决支持越南人民英勇的抗美救国斗争，支持越南民主共和国调查美帝国主义在越南的战争罪行委员会的声明。
    两位负责人指出，最近，美帝国主义头子约翰逊亲自出马，召开所谓马尼拉“七国首脑会议”，在越南问题上玩弄反革命两手，大搞“以战迫和”的阴谋。苏联修正主义领导集团也大肆活动，在越南问题上竭力为美帝国主义的阴谋效劳，积极充当美帝国主义的头号帮凶。不管是美帝国主义，还是现代修正主义都将逃脱不了历史的惩罚和彻底失败的命运。
    青联和学联的负责人最后说，我们中国青年和学生，遵照我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的教导，同全国人民一起，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，坚决支持越南人民打到底！
