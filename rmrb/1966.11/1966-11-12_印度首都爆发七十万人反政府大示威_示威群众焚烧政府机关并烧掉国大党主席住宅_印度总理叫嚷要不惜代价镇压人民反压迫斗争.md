New Delhi witnessed a massive anti-government protest on November 7. This event, along with the ongoing wave of anti-government struggles across India, has severely shaken the Indian National Congress government.

The protest in front of the Parliament building saw the participation of 700,000 people. The Indian government ordered the police and military to suppress and brutally massacre the protesters. It is estimated that 10 people were killed and about 500 were injured.

Enraged crowds set fire to several government departments near the Parliament building, including the All India Radio, the Ministry of Transport, and the Press Information Bureau. They smashed equipment in the offices of the Indian Press Trust and set fire to more than 200 cars, with smoke billowing into the sky.

The crowd also set fire to the residence of Indian National Congress President Kamaraj, who was resting at home and fled in a hurry through a side door. They also attacked the residences of the Minister of Supplies, the Minister of Power, and the offices of the Minister of Labour. All shops in the city were closed.

The direct cause of this event was the demand by Hindus for the government to order a nationwide ban on the slaughter of cows, which they consider "sacred." Some far-right parties exploited the religious sentiments of the people, inciting them against the Indian National Congress government to gain votes in the upcoming elections next year. At the same time, this event is also an outburst of the deep-seated anger of the Indian people against the government.

New Delhi has been under a 48-hour curfew since 3 PM on November 7. The government issued an order prohibiting gatherings of more than four people.

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi shouted in the parliament on November 8 that India is facing an increasingly serious threat of violent behavior. The Indian government is prepared to "suppress it at any cost." However, the Indian government, which is fierce on the outside but weak on the inside, is also trying to appease the people's anger by reshuffling the government. Indian newspapers reported on November 10 that the Indian President has accepted the resignation of the Minister of Home Affairs, Nanda. Indira Gandhi will temporarily take over the Ministry of Home Affairs.

It is reported that she had planned to appoint the Minister of Defense, Chavan, as the Minister of Home Affairs, but faced opposition from some high-ranking officials within the Indian National Congress.

    印度首都爆发七十万人反政府大示威
    示威群众焚烧政府机关并烧掉国大党主席住宅
    印度总理叫嚷要不惜代价镇压人民反压迫斗争
    新华社十日讯　新德里消息：印度首都新德里七日发生了大规模的反政府示威。这个事件和目前正在印度各地继续高涨的群众反政府斗争的浪潮，猛烈地冲击着印度国大党政府。
    七日在议会大厦前举行的示威有七十万人参加。印度政府下令警察和调来军队镇压和血腥屠杀示威者，据估计，打死十人，打伤五百人左右。
    愤怒的群众放火烧议会大厦附近印度政府的一些部门，其中包括全印电台、运输部和新闻局的一些建筑。他们用石头打坏印度报业托辣斯办公室的一些用具，还把二百多辆汽车点火焚烧，火烟直冲云霄。
    群众还放火烧掉国大党主席卡马拉季的住宅，正在家里休息的卡马拉季从旁门慌忙逃跑。群众还袭击供应部长的住宅以及电力部长和劳工部长的办公室。市内商店都关了门。
    这个事件的直接起因是印度教徒要求政府下令在全国禁止屠宰他们认为是“神圣”的牛。一些极右翼的政党利用群众的宗教情绪，煽动他们反对国大党政府，为自己在明年的大选中捞取选票。同时，这个事件也是印度人民群众长期以来反对政府的深刻愤怒的大爆发。
    新德里从七日下午三时起实行四十八小时的戒严。政府发布了禁止四个人以上集会的禁令。
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地八日在议会上叫喊说，印度面临越来越严重的暴力行为的威胁。印度政府准备“不惜代价把它镇压下去”。但是色厉内荏的印度政府同时用换汤不换药的改组政府办法来企图平息群众的愤怒。印度报纸十日报道，印度总统已经接受内政部长南达辞职。英迪拉·甘地暂时兼管内政部。
    据报道，她曾经打算任命国防部长恰范担任内政部长，但是受到了国大党内一些高级官员的反对。（附图片）
