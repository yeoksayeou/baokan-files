We are seafarers on ocean-going vessels, frequently entering the ports of many countries around the world. Through our interactions with the people of these countries, we deeply feel the boundless love that the revolutionary people of the world have for our great leader Chairman Mao, and their deep yearning for China.

Chairman Mao said, "Our revolution has gained the sympathy and cheers of the broad masses of people around the world, and our friends are everywhere in the world." In Zanzibar, a few young people boarded our ship and immediately expressed their desire to obtain a record of the song "The East is Red," which praises Chairman Mao. They said they wanted their comrades to hear the song praising the world's revolutionary leader every day. We fulfilled their wish and gave them a portrait of Chairman Mao. The African friends held the portrait of Chairman Mao in both hands and affectionately said, "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong." Then they sang loudly together with the crew.

A worker from a store in France, upon seeing our crew members wearing bright red Chairman Mao badges, was envious. He hoped to exchange badges with us and quickly took out many badges for us to choose from. He said, "I have been longing day and night to have a Chairman Mao badge. You are the first Chinese friends I have met, and the significance is especially great." We solemnly pinned a Chairman Mao badge on his chest. He was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes, and he tightly grasped our hands, repeatedly saying, "Thank you very much."

Chairman Mao's works are not only a scientific summary of the revolutionary struggle experience in China but also a scientific summary of the revolutionary struggle experience of the world. They are the highest level of Marxist-Leninist classics in contemporary times. The revolutionary people of the world regard obtaining Chairman Mao's works as their greatest happiness. A friend from Zanzibar, upon receiving the fourth volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from our hands, excitedly said, "We have been trying various means to obtain Chairman Mao's works. Now you have brought us this precious book, which is wonderful." He requested to obtain the other three volumes as soon as possible to learn the truth of revolution and find the path forward.

The revolutionary people of the world love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought because Chairman Mao has brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism in a comprehensive way. Mao Zedong Thought reflects the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the working people, and is the guiding light for all oppressed nations and peoples to rise up and seek liberation in contemporary times. Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, giving them the strength, wisdom, and confidence to struggle. Friends from East Africa told us, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of the revolutionary people of Africa. He understands us the most and firmly supports us. Our country is not large, but the revolutionary people drove away the old and new colonialists with primitive spears and clubs. This is the most powerful proof of Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."

The boundless love and respect that friends from various countries have for Chairman Mao greatly inspire and educate us. We, the seafarers on ocean-going vessels, under the guidance of the great Party and Chairman Mao, nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought, feel extremely happy and honored to support the world revolution, to spread Mao Zedong Thought, and to develop the fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao is not only our great helmsman but also the great helmsman of the world revolution. We will, together with the revolutionary people of the world, break through the fog, overcome the stormy waves, and forever advance bravely along the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao!

    毛主席是世界革命航船的伟大舵手
    我们是远洋船员，经常出入世界许多国家的港口。在和这些国家人民的接触中，深深地感受到世界革命人民对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对中国无限向往。
    毛主席说：“我们的革命已经获得全世界广大人民的同情和欢呼，我们的朋友遍于全世界。”在桑给巴尔，有几位青年一上船，就表示想得到歌颂毛主席的《东方红》唱片。他们说，要让他们的战友天天听到歌颂世界革命导师的歌声。我们满足了他们的愿望，并赠给他们一幅毛主席像。非洲朋友双手捧着毛主席像亲切地说：“毛泽东，毛泽东。”然后他们和船员一道放声歌唱起来。
    法国一家商店的一位工作人员，发现我国船员佩戴着红光闪闪的毛主席像纪念章，羡慕得不得了。他希望同我们交换，急忙拿出许多纪念章让我们选。他说：“我日夜盼望能有一枚毛主席像纪念章，你们是我第一次见到的中国朋友，意义格外重大。”我们郑重地把一枚毛主席像纪念章戴在他的胸前。他激动得热泪盈眶，紧紧握住我们的手，连声说：非常感谢。
    毛主席的书，不仅是中国革命斗争经验的科学总结，而且是世界革命斗争经验的科学总结，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义经典著作。世界革命人民把得到毛主席著作看作最大的幸福。一位桑给巴尔朋友从我们手里得到一本《毛泽东选集》第四卷时，激动地说：“我们曾通过各种办法希望得到毛主席著作，现在你们给我们送来了宝书，太好了。”他要求能尽快地得到另外三卷，从中学习革命的真理，寻找前进的道路。
    世界革命人民热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想。这是因为毛主席天才地创造性地全面地发展了马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想反映了无产阶级和劳动人民的根本利益，是当代一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民闹翻身、谋解放的指路明灯。毛泽东思想照亮了世界革命人民的心，给了他们斗争的力量、智慧和信心。东非朋友告诉我们：“毛主席不但是你们中国人民的伟大领袖，也是非洲革命人民的领袖。他最了解我们，最坚定地支持我们。我们的国家并不大，但革命人民用原始的长矛木棒就把新老殖民主义者赶跑了，这是毛主席的帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎英明论断的最有力证明。”
    各国朋友对毛主席的无限热爱、无限敬仰，极大地鼓舞和教育了我们。我们远洋船员，在伟大的党和毛主席的教导下，在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，为支援世界革命，为传播毛泽东思想和发展中国人民同世界各国革命人民的战斗友谊而感到无比幸福，无上光荣。毛主席不仅是我们的伟大舵手，而且是世界革命航船的伟大舵手。我们要同世界革命人民一起，拨开迷雾，冲破惊涛骇浪，永远沿着毛主席所开辟的革命航道奋勇前进！
