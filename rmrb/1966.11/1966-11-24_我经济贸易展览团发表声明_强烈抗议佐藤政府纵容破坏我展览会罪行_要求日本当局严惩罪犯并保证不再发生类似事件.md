The Chinese Economic and Trade Delegation issued a statement strongly protesting the Sato government's tolerance of the sabotage of our exhibition. It demands that the Japanese authorities severely punish the culprits and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

	New China News Agency, November 23rd: Tokyo - On the 22nd, Deputy Secretary-General Ren Jianxin of the Chinese Economic and Trade Delegation met with Japanese reporters and issued a statement on behalf of the delegation. The statement strongly protests the Sato government's tolerance of right-wing groups sabotaging the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition in Nagoya. It also demands that the Sato government punish the criminals and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

	The statement points out that the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition was held in accordance with the agreement signed by friendly trade organizations of both countries. Its purpose is to enhance mutual understanding between the peoples of China and Japan, strengthen friendship, and promote trade between the two countries. When the exhibition was held in Kitakyushu, 1.55 million people visited it. On the first day of the exhibition in Nagoya, 160,000 people visited it. This fully demonstrates the Japanese people's concern for the exhibition and their friendship towards the Chinese people. The statement says, however, that regrettably, the Japanese government has ignored the common desire of the peoples of both countries for friendship. It has tolerated right-wing groups in carrying out anti-China propaganda during the exhibition, even in front of the exhibition hall, slandering our great leader and defaming our socialist China. We cannot tolerate such criminal acts that sabotage the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. Therefore, the Chinese Economic and Trade Delegation of the People's Republic of China strongly protests to the Japanese government and solemnly points out that all consequences arising from this should be borne by the Japanese government.

	The statement says that friendship between China and Japan is the common desire of the 800 million people of both countries. Friendship between China and Japan not only concerns the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries but also is a major issue related to peace in Asia and the world. Any elements that obstruct and sabotage the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition and obstruct and sabotage friendship between China and Japan are enemies of the peoples of both countries and enemies of the peoples of Asia and the world. The statement says that we solemnly declare that following the U.S. imperialists, colluding with Soviet modern revisionists and reactionaries of various countries, and committing heinous crimes of sabotaging Sino-Japanese friendship, as well as the evil acts of tolerating hooligans to sabotage the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition, are absolutely unacceptable to the peoples of both countries and will be resisted and condemned by the Japanese people who genuinely want to be friends with the Chinese people. Ultimately, they will be swept away and buried by the great historical tide of Sino-Japanese friendship.

	The statement concludes by saying that the Chinese Economic and Trade Delegation will unswervingly follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, adhere to the policy of developing friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and together with the Japanese people, make new contributions to the friendship and trade development between the peoples of both countries.

    我经济贸易展览团发表声明
    强烈抗议佐藤政府纵容破坏我展览会罪行
    要求日本当局严惩罪犯并保证不再发生类似事件
    新华社二十三日讯　东京消息：中国经济贸易展览团副秘书长任健新二十二日接见日本记者，发表了中国经济贸易展览团的声明，强烈抗议日本佐藤政府纵容右翼团体破坏在名古屋举行的中国经济贸易展览会，并且要求佐藤政府惩办罪犯，保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    声明指出，中国经济贸易展览会是根据中日双方友好贸易团体签订的协议，为了增进中日两国人民的了解，加强两国人民的友好，促进中日民间贸易而举办的。展览会在北九州展出时有一百五十五万人参观，展览会在名古屋开幕第一天就有十六万人参观。这充分表达了日本广大人民对展览会的关心，和对中国人民的友谊。声明说，但是，遗憾的是：日本政府无视中日两国人民要求友好的共同愿望，纵容右翼团体在展览期间，甚至在展览会门前进行反华宣传，诬蔑我们伟大的领袖，诽谤我们社会主义的中国。对这种破坏中日两国人民友谊的罪恶行为，我们是不能容忍的。为此，中华人民共和国经济贸易展览团向日本政府提出强烈抗议，并郑重指出，由此而引起的一切后果应由日本政府负责。
    声明说，中日友好是中日两国八亿人民的共同愿望。中日友好不仅是关系到中日两国人民的根本利益，而且也是关系到亚洲和世界和平的大事。任何阻挠和破坏中国经济贸易展览会，阻挠和破坏中日两国友好的分子，都是中日两国人民的敌人，也是亚洲和全世界人民的敌人。声明说，我们郑重声明，追随美帝国主义，勾结苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派，破坏中日友好的滔天罪行和纵容暴徒破坏中国经济贸易展览会的罪恶行为，是中日两国人民绝对不能允许的，将遭到要求同中国人民真正友好的日本人民抗击和唾弃，最后定将被中日友好的巨大历史洪流冲垮和埋葬。
    声明最后说，中国经济贸易展览团将坚定不移地遵循毛主席的教导，坚持发展中日两国人民友好的方针，同日本人民一道，为中日两国人民的友好和贸易的发展做出新的贡献。
