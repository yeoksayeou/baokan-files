Before dawn, the sky was thick with low, murky clouds. On the winding road from Pan Mountain to Yangquanzi, thirteen Red Guards from Camping Three Middle School in Liaoning's Yingkou formed a "Long March Propaganda Team." They were marching forward, backs laden with gear, spirited and full of vigor.

A cold wind blew, the red flag fluttered, and the trees swayed. "Comrades, are you cold?" the team leader asked. Amidst the wind, a loud voice echoed back, "Not cold! Forward!"

In truth, how could they not be cold? Some were wearing only a padded jacket, while others had on just two thin shirts! Yet, facing the cold wind, they declared, "Wind, blow away! You can chill our skin, but you can never chill our hearts that love Chairman Mao!"

After daybreak, the wind subsided, but the sky began to drizzle.

"Comrades, quickly wrap the ears of corn!" the team leader shouted again.

These golden ears of corn were what they had planted with their own hands in response to Chairman Mao's call for students to focus on their studies while also learning other skills. They decided to offer them to Chairman Mao. The young warriors chose the best of their three raincoats to wrap the ears of corn, then packed them into their backpacks.

The rain turned into a torrential downpour! The young warriors had two raincoats left, but the two raincoats were passed around among the thirteen people; everyone pushed and pulled, no one willing to wear it. Finally, they folded the raincoats and challenged the storm:

"Wind and rain, no matter how fierce, cannot match the resolve of the Red Guards. Forward!"

They walked another ten miles when suddenly, hailstones began to fall. At this point, due to the cold, hunger, and exhaustion, the young warriors' faces were all purple. Suddenly, a Liberation truck drove up from behind and stopped beside them. Two drivers jumped out: "Comrades, quickly get on the car!"

Facing the hailstones, the vast, desolate grassland, and their soaked bodies, the young warrior Feng Haibo had some thoughts. Since yesterday, he had to stop every short distance to relieve himself. He thought, "If I keep going like this, what if I fall ill? That would cause so much trouble for my comrades! Should I sit in the car for a while?" Just as this thought crossed his mind, another strong voice surged in his heart. He remembered standing before Chairman Mao's portrait at the start of the journey, reciting two quotations: "'This army possesses an indomitable spirit; it will vanquish all enemies and will never be subdued by any enemy.' Our Red Propaganda Team must 'resolutely fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' We must walk step by step with our own feet to Chairman Mao's side!" As he thought this, Chairman Mao's words dispelled his doubts, and the doubts were replaced by two shining words: Forward! He quickly said to everyone, "We can't ride the car! If we were to ride from Yingkou, wouldn't that be more comfortable?"

"Haibo, you're right!" the young warriors hugged Haibo tightly and said, "If you can walk with dysentery, why can't we? With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, what difficulties can we not overcome!"

"Yes, think about the old Red Army marching 25,000 miles! Compared to the old Red Army, our difficulties are nothing! Chairman Mao, in the midst of great winds and waves, crossed the Yangtze River. How can we retreat in the face of difficulties? No matter how strong the wind, rain, and hail, we'll face them head-on!"

They thanked the drivers in unison, "Thank you, driver comrades. We will walk to Chairman Mao's side with our own two legs!" Hearing this, the drivers were deeply moved and nodded, "Great! Great! Little Red Guards, you're amazing! When you get to Beijing, send us a message. Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" Saying this, they jumped back into the car and drove away.

"Comrades, let's rest in the rain and eat our bread before we go!" Everyone sat in the rain, taking out their hard, cold bread. But among the thirteen people, there were only two small thermoses, one of which was reserved for the sick. The remaining thermos, they all wanted to drink from, but as soon as they held it, everyone would shake it, swallow some saliva, and pass it to the next person, no one daring to drink.

Young warrior Feng Haibo held the bread, feeling nauseous. At this moment, his comrades encouraged him, "Haibo, muster your strength and eat the bread! Every bite of bread adds strength, and we can advance to victory!" Then, everyone recounted the story of the Battle of Triangle Hill.

Chairman Mao's words, the story of Triangle Hill, and the deep class feelings among comrades gave Feng Haibo great strength. He mustered his willpower and ate the bread.

The "Long March Propaganda Team" continued to advance. As they approached a small bridge, the team leader called out, "Comrades, look!" Everyone looked and saw, for the first time that day, houses!

"Can we rest halfway?" the team leader quickly asked. The young warriors replied, "Team leader, we can't go in. We must continue forward!"

After they passed the small house, the road workers inside saw the young warriors drenched in rain and came out to pull them into the house. The young warriors, unable to refuse, reluctantly entered. The workers quickly started a fire and brewed tea. The young warriors felt as comfortable as if they were at home, the fire warming them so nicely! As they warmed themselves, snow began to fall outside!

Inside, the fire burned brightly, and outside, snowflakes danced. Should they rest halfway and enjoy the warmth indoors, or continue marching and endure the ice and snow? They recalled Chairman Mao's words: "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous battle (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." They declined the workers' hospitality, picked up their backpacks, and stepped out the door. Rolling cold winds enveloped the young warriors in a whirlwind of snow...

After walking twenty miles in water, snow, and mud, four out of the thirteen had blisters on their feet that had burst, and two young warriors felt stomach pains. The sky darkened again. Now, every step required all their strength. But there were still fifteen miles to the destination, Yangquanzi. What should they do?

The healthier students took the sick comrades' backpacks and put their hands on their shoulders, hobbling along together.

"Comrades, perseverance is victory! Every step forward brings us closer to Chairman Mao. Comrades, forward!"

The sky was completely dark, and walking became extremely difficult. They ignored their parched throats and repeatedly recited, "Resolutely fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's words were like spiritual atomic bombs. Relying on Mao Zedong Thought, these "Little Red Guards" persevered through the wind, rain, and snow, marching ninety-six miles.

On November 11th, under the bright sun and amidst the flowing crowds of Beijing's streets, the members of the "Long March Propaganda Team" finally saw the Chairman Mao they had longed for day and night! They excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" As they shouted, tears streamed down their faces!

Chairman Mao's open-top car had long since driven away, but it seemed as if Chairman Mao was still standing before them. The young warriors, tears in their eyes, said with great emotion, "Chairman Mao, the brightest sun in our hearts! We followed your words and walked through the wind, rain, and snow. We are determined to undergo more tempering and forever follow you through the storms of life!"

    风雪磨炼“小红军”
    红晓
    天还没亮，漫天是厚厚的、低低的浊云。在盘山通向羊圈子的大路上，辽宁营口三中十三名红卫兵组成的“长征宣传队”，背着行装，正雄赳赳、气昂昂地行进着。
    一阵寒风扑来，红旗翻卷，树木摇动。“同志们，冷不？”队长问道。在风声中，回荡着一个响亮的声音：“不冷！前进吧！”
    其实，他们怎么会不冷呢？他们有的只穿了一件绒衣，有的还只穿着两件单衣呢！可是，他们面对着寒风说：“寒风呵！你吹吧！你能吹冷我的皮肤，可是你永远吹不冷我们热爱毛主席的心！”
    天亮后，寒风渐息，老天又洒下了雨点。
      “同志们，赶快把谷穗包好啦！”队长又喊。
    这把金灿灿的谷穗，是他们响应毛主席的学生以学为主，兼学别样的号召，用自己的双手种出来的。他们决定把它献给毛主席。小将们在仅有的三件雨衣中挑了一件最好的，把谷穗包起来，又裹进了背包。
    雨越下越大，变成了瓢泼似的大雨！小将们还有两件雨衣，但两件雨衣在十三个人手里递来递去；你推我让，谁也不肯披。最后，他们干脆把雨衣叠起来，向暴风雨挑战：
  “风雨再大，没有红卫兵决心大。前进！”
    他们又走了十多里路，突然，冰雹劈劈啪啪地打了下来。这时由于冷饿冻累，小将们脸色都发紫了。突然，一辆解放牌汽车从背后驶到小将们身边停下，从车上跳下两位司机：“同志们，快上车吧！”
    面对头上的冰雹，渺无人烟的草原，一身雨水，在小将丰海波脑子里闪出了一些念头。他从昨天开始，走不多远就要拉一次痢。他想：“这样下去，一旦病倒了，该给同志们增添多少麻烦呵！是不是坐一下车呢？”这杂念刚刚冒出，另一个强大的声音又涌上心头。他记得出发时，曾站在毛主席像前，用这样两条语录宣过誓：“我们‘这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。’我们红色宣传队一定要‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’要用自己的双脚一步一步地走到毛主席身边！”一想到这里，毛主席的话打消了他的杂念，杂念顿时换成了两个光辉的大字：向前！他忙冲着大伙说：“咱们不能坐车呵！要坐车，从营口坐，不是更舒服一些吗？”
      “海波，你说得对呵！”小将们紧紧搂着海波说：“你能拉着痢疾走，咱们还不能走吗？咱们有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有什么困难不能克服！”
      “是呀，想想老红军长征了二万五千里，咱们这点困难，比起老红军来算个啥？毛主席他老人家在大风大浪中还横渡长江，咱们怎能遇难而退？风大雨大冰雹大，咱们碰它一碰就好啦！”
    他们齐声向司机道谢：“谢谢司机同志，我们要用两条腿走到毛主席的身边！”听了这番话，司机深为感动，点头说：“好呵，好呵！小红军，了不起！到了北京，给咱们捎个信儿。祝毛主席他老人家万寿无疆！”说罢，跳上车就把汽车开走了。
      “同志们，咱们就在雨里歇歇，把馍吃了再走吧！”大家坐在雨水里，掏出硬梆梆的冷馍，但是十三个人才有两个小水壶，其中有一个是专门留给病号喝的；剩下的一个水壶，他们多想喝呵！但是一拿到手上，大家都是摇一摇，咽一咽口水，就递给了另一个人，谁也不肯喝。
    小将丰海波拿着馒头，心里直作呕。这时，同志们鼓励他说：“海波，拿出毅力来，把馒头吃下去！吃一口馍，就增加一分力，就能胜利前进！”接着，大家又讲起了上甘岭的故事。
    毛主席的话，上甘岭的故事，以及同志们深厚的阶级感情，给了丰海波很大的力量，他用顽强的毅力把馍吃下去了。
      “长征宣传队”又在继续前进。走到一座小桥边，队长叫道：“同志们，看！”大家放眼一看，呵，他们今天第一次看见房子了！
      “咱们能在半途休息吗？”队长忙问。小将们忙说：“队长，不能进去，咱们要继续前进！”
    当他们走过小屋之后，屋里的养路工人看到小将们一身淌着雨水，忙出来拉他们进屋。小将们推脱不了，才不得不走进去。工人们又是烧火，又是沏茶，小将们像到了自己家里一样，火烤得多么舒服呵！烤着烤着，外面竟拂拂扬扬地撒下漫天的雪来！
    屋里炉火正旺，窗外雪花纷飞。是中途住下来，贪恋这室内的温暖，还是继续行军，经受冰天雪地的考验呢？他们想起毛主席语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”就谢绝了工人的挽留，背起背包，跨出了屋门。滚滚的寒风，把小将包围到大雪的漩涡中……
    在水里，雪里，泥泞里走了二十里路之后，十三人中，有四个人脚上的血泡全都磨破，有两个小将感到肚子疼。天又黑下来了。现在，他们每走一步，都需要付出全身的力气了。可是，离目的地羊圈子还有十五里，这怎么办呢？
    身体好的同学把病号的背包抢来自己背，把病号的手搭在自己的肩膀上，大家一瘸一拐地走着。
      “同志们，坚持就是胜利！咱们每向前走一步，就离毛主席近一步。同志们，前进啦！”
    天完全漆黑了，走路更是万分艰难，他们不顾喉头干渴，一次次地朗诵着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的话是精神原子弹。靠了毛泽东思想，这些“小红军”在大风雨雪中坚持行进了九十六里。
    十一月十一日，在阳光灿烂，人流如河的北京城的大道上，“长征宣传队”队员们终于见到了他们日思夜想的毛主席！他们激动地欢呼“毛主席万岁，毛主席万岁！”随着喊声，滴下了一串串的热泪！
    毛主席乘坐的敞篷汽车虽然开过很久了，可是毛主席仿佛一直是站立在他们眼前。小将们含着眼泪，无比激动地说：“毛主席呵，我们心中最红最红的太阳！我们听你的话，在大风雨雪中走来了，我们要决心经受更多的锻炼，永远跟着你在大风大浪中前进！”（附图片）
    他们齐声向司机道谢：“谢谢司机同志，我们要用两条腿走到毛主席的身边！”
