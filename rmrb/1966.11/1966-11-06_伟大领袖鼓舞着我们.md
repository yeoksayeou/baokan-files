Great Leader Inspires Us

	Mao Chairman, you received us amidst your busy schedule, and we feel immense happiness. With your guidance, we dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire. The power-holders who walk the capitalist road and the executors of the bourgeois reactionary line try to suppress us with the "counter-revolutionary" label, but this only strengthens our revolutionary resolve. We will forge a body of steel in the storm and stress! We will definitely inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, dedicating everything to the ultimate realization of the great communist cause.

	November 3rd, what a happy day! On this day, we, the Red Guards and revolutionary students from the border regions of our motherland, were inspected by the great leader Chairman Mao.

	Coming to Chairman Mao's side, our hearts are broader, our eyes are brighter, our revolutionary passion is more abundant, and our fighting will is more resolute. Chairman Mao, with your guidance, we will definitely sweep away all obstacles and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end in our region!

	We come from the southwestern border of our motherland—Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province. The Bai people all love and admire Chairman Mao; he is our great savior. On the afternoon of the 3rd, we saw Chairman Mao at Tiananmen, feeling boundless happiness and honor. We are about to return to school with the experience of the proletarian cultural revolution we learned in the capital. As we leave Beijing, we solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao: We will definitely respond to your great call, care about national affairs, and throw ourselves into the cultural revolution. We will thoroughly smash the "four olds" and establish the "four news," building Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture even more beautifully.

	Today, November 3rd, is my happiest day. I saw our most beloved leader Chairman Mao at Tiananmen. I jumped and cheered, tears streaming down, unable to express my excitement. I clearly saw that by his side was his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao. I will definitely learn from Comrade Lin Biao, be loyal to Chairman Mao, and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We Red Guards will use our red hearts to build a Great Wall of ten thousand li to defend Mao Zedong Thought, and be lifelong little red soldiers of Chairman Mao.

	In the old society without sunlight, we poor blind people had no way out; even begging for food, we couldn't find the door. It was Chairman Mao who liberated us blind people, sending us to school to study. Today, we came to Beijing to be inspected by Chairman Mao, and a few representatives even ascended the reviewing stand. This is the greatest happiness and honor for us blind people. Chairman Mao! We promise you: We will actively participate in the proletarian cultural revolution. Although our eyes are blind, Mao Zedong Thought makes us clear-sighted, and no ghosts or snakes can escape.

	Chairman Mao has already received revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards for the sixth time. My long-cherished wish to see Chairman Mao has finally come true. I will forever remember this happiest moment, using it as a great motivating force to revolutionize my thinking. I will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, becoming a steadfast warrior defending Mao Zedong Thought.

	On the morning of the 3rd, we were on our way to Jinggangshan during our Long March, hearing from the radio that Chairman Mao was receiving revolutionary teachers and students for the sixth time. We cheered with the inspected revolutionary teachers and students for the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. When the radio announced the start of the parade, we packed our belongings and continued our Long March, bringing the good news to the people along the way.

	Most beloved Chairman Mao, we promise you: We will definitely overcome all difficulties, complete this long-distance linkup successfully, learn from the workers and peasants along the way, and spread Mao Zedong Thought to every place along the way.

	Day and night, we have been longing for this day! Finally, we saw the great leader Chairman Mao, and a thousand words surged to our hearts. Let us shout a thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal youth!"

    伟大领袖鼓舞着我们
    毛主席，您在百忙中接见我们，我们感到无比幸福。有了您的指引，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯。走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线的执行者，用“反革命”的帽子来压我们，只能更坚定我们的革命决心。我们就是要在狂风暴雨中锻炼出一身钢筋铁骨！我们一定继承和发扬无产阶级的革命造反精神，为最后实现伟大的共产主义事业贡献自己的一切。

    十一月三日，这是一个多么幸福的日子啊！这一天，我们这些来自祖国边疆的红卫兵和革命学生，接受了伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。
    来到了毛主席的身边，我们的心胸更广阔了，我们的眼睛更明亮了，我们的革命激情更充沛了，我们的斗争意志更坚定了。毛主席啊毛主席，我们有您的指引，一定能够扫除一切障碍，把我们地区的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！

    我们来自祖国的西南边疆——云南省大理白族自治州。我们白族人民都热爱毛主席，崇拜毛主席，他老人家是我们白族人民的大救星。三日下午一点，我们在天安门见到了毛主席，感到无限幸福，无限光荣。我们马上就要带着在首都学到的无产阶级文化大革命的经验回校了。在离京之际，我们坚决向毛主席保证：一定响应您的伟大号召，关心国家大事，投身到文化大革命中去，大破“四旧”，大立“四新”，把大理白族自治州建设得更美好。

    今天，十一月三日，是我最幸福的日子，我在天安门见到了最敬爱的领袖毛主席。我跳呀，欢呼呀，热泪滚滚，怎么也表达不了我的激动心情。我清清楚楚地看到，在他老人家身边，是他的亲密战友林彪同志。我一定要向林彪同志学习，要像他那样忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。我们红卫兵要用自己的红心，筑成捍卫毛泽东思想的万里长城，做一辈子毛主席的红小兵。

    在暗无天日的旧社会，我们穷苦人家的盲人是没有出路的，就是连要饭也摸不到大门啊。是毛主席解放了我们盲人，把我们送进学校读书。今天又来到北京，接受毛主席的检阅，还有几名代表登上了观礼台，这是我们盲人的最大幸福，最大光荣。毛主席啊！我们向您保证，一定要积极参加无产阶级文化大革命。虽然我们的双目失明了，但毛泽东思想使我们心明眼亮，一切牛鬼蛇神休想逃脱。

    毛主席已经是第六次接见革命师生和红卫兵了。我多年来盼望见到毛主席的愿望终于实现了。我要永远记住这个最幸福的时刻，把它作为鞭策我思想革命化的巨大鼓舞力量。我一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，做一个捍卫毛泽东思想的坚强战士。

    三日上午，我们在往井冈山的长征途中，从收音机里听到毛主席第六次接见革命师生的喜讯。我们和受检阅的革命师生同声欢呼毛主席的革命路线的胜利。当收音机里宣布游行开始，我们也收拾起行装，继续长征，把喜讯带给沿途人民。
    最最敬爱的毛主席，我们向您保证：我们一定要排除万难，胜利完成这次徒步大串连，向沿途工农学习，把毛泽东思想传播到沿途各地。

    日日想啊夜夜盼，终于盼到了这一天！见到了伟大领袖毛主席，千言万语涌上心头。让我们千百次高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”“敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！”　          本报记者摄
