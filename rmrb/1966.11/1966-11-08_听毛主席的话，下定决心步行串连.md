The revolutionary Long March path must be walked personally; the hardships of the revolution must be experienced personally. Follow Chairman Mao's words, resolutely decide to travel on foot for link-up.

Revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards from all places have expressed their resolute response to Comrade Lin Biao's call, and will carry out on-foot link-ups in a planned, organized, and prepared manner. They are determined to familiarize themselves with society, the masses, and class struggle through the Long March, to better learn from workers and peasants, to better spread Mao Zedong Thought, and to resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao supports revolutionary teachers and students in traveling on foot for link-ups, which has greatly encouraged revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from various places. The young revolutionaries have expressed their determination to respond resolutely to Comrade Lin Biao's call and to carry out on-foot link-ups in a planned, organized, and prepared manner.

They are determined to fear neither mountains nor rivers, to overcome all difficulties and hardships, to familiarize themselves with society, the masses, and class struggle through on-foot link-ups, to withstand the test of storms and waves, and to temper themselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who dare to fight and are good at fighting.

Not long ago, the revolutionary youngsters of the "Long March Red Guards" from the Dalian Maritime Institute traveled over 2,000 miles on foot and successfully reached the capital. The editorial "Red Guards Fear No Difficulties in the Long March" published by the People's Daily for these revolutionary youngsters' pioneering deed was like the first thunder of spring, greatly inspiring the broad revolutionary youngsters who were conducting revolutionary link-ups. They actively prepared to conduct on-foot link-ups. On November 3rd, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected the Cultural Revolution army for the sixth time. Comrade Lin Biao, in his speech at the meeting, conveyed the news of Chairman Mao's support for on-foot link-ups and called on revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards to carry out on-foot link-ups in a planned, organized, and prepared manner. This further inspired the broad revolutionary youngsters' firm determination and strong will to participate in on-foot link-ups. Now, from the northeastern Harbin to the southwestern border of Lhasa, from the coastal cities of Shanghai and Fuzhou to the northwestern plateau of Lanzhou and Xining, from the Inner Mongolian Hohhot to the central city of Wuhan and the southern gateway of Guangzhou, tens of thousands of revolutionary youngsters from all over the country have set their ambitious goals to traverse mountains and rivers. They have formed on-foot link-up teams with names such as "East is Red," "Learn from the Red Army," "Long March University," "Torch," "Successors," and "Red Women's Detachment," determined to follow in the footsteps of revolutionary predecessors, to march towards the revolutionary old base areas and remote places in their provinces and regions, to the center of the Cultural Revolution Beijing, to the revolutionary cradle of Jinggangshan, to the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, and to immerse themselves among the masses to learn, to temper themselves, and to spread the seeds of the Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary youngsters are determined not to be hothouse flowers but to be sturdy pines on the mountains, to welcome the challenges of storms and rains, to experience wind and rain, to see the world, and to be tempered in the great school of on-foot link-ups. They have said: The Long March path, we must walk it ourselves; the hardships of the revolution, we must taste them ourselves. We must bring back revolutionary experience and spread revolutionary seeds, and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards are determined to widely and deeply contact the masses and various aspects of society during on-foot link-ups, to better learn from workers and peasants, to better spread Mao Zedong Thought, to understand class struggle in socialist society, and to deeply grasp Chairman Mao's correct line.

Revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from various places have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of not fighting unprepared battles and not fighting battles without assurance, and have actively and seriously prepared for on-foot link-ups. In all preparations, they have especially emphasized doing a good job in ideological preparation and arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Red Guards organizations from universities and colleges in Beijing, Guangzhou, Urumqi, Jinan, and Hohhot have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and other works. They have said: Only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought can endure hardships and hard work, have a strong revolutionary will, and conquer mountains and rivers to complete the Long March task. The youngsters have also seriously studied the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention of the PLA. Many places' Red Guards and revolutionary teachers have invited old Red Army soldiers to introduce the Long March situation and marching knowledge. They have said: In on-foot link-ups, we not only want to do good deeds for the masses like the PLA but also want to propagate to the masses along the way, to closely connect with the masses, and to humbly learn from the masses. They are determined to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works during on-foot link-ups and to establish a proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people and the revolution.

Many Red Guard youngsters have seriously discussed the great significance and methods of on-foot revolutionary link-ups. They have said: Propagating to the masses in on-foot link-ups is also educating oneself and must first act according to Chairman Mao's instructions: "To understand the situation, the only method is to conduct a social survey and investigate the lively situation of various classes in society." On-foot link-ups are the best way to conduct social surveys and are a compulsory course for successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Now, revolutionary youngsters preparing for on-foot link-ups in various places are determined to take Chairman Mao's teaching of "The Long March is a declaration, the Long March is a propaganda team, the Long March is a sowing machine" as their action guideline. Revolutionary youngsters participating in the Long March team have prepared steel plates, wax paper, and printing machines, printed propaganda materials, rehearsed performance items, and are ready to propagate Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go, just like the "Long March Red Guards" from the Dalian Maritime Institute.

The entire team of the Jingan Mountain Red Guards Long March Team from the Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute stood in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes before their departure and solemnly swore: Resolutely follow the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, carry forward the fighting spirit of revolutionary martyrs, tread through stormy waves, and advance courageously!

The Red Guards from Xinjiang Institute of Technology have formed a "Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao" Long March team, bravely advancing on the Gobi Desert, facing six or seven-level strong winds, towards our heart's red sun—the most beloved leader Chairman Mao in Beijing!

    革命的长征路要亲自走一走　革命的风霜苦要亲自尝一尝
    听毛主席的话，下定决心步行串连
    各地广大革命师生和红卫兵表示坚决响应林彪同志的号召，有计划有组织有准备地进行步行串连，决心在长征中熟悉社会，熟悉群众，熟悉阶级斗争，更好地向工农学习，更好地传播毛泽东思想，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    新华社七日讯　我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席支持革命师生步行串连，给各地大中学校的革命师生和红卫兵极大鼓舞。革命小将们纷纷表示坚决响应林彪同志的号召，有计划、有组织、有准备地进行步行串连。
    他们决心不怕千山万水，不怕艰难险阻，通过步行串连，去熟悉社会，熟悉群众，熟悉阶级斗争，经受大风大浪的考验，把自己锻炼成为敢于斗争、善于斗争的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    不久前，大连海运学院“长征红卫队”革命小将步行两千多里胜利到达了首都。《人民日报》为这些革命小将的创举发表的社论《红卫兵不怕远征难》，有如春雷初动，给正在进行革命大串连的广大革命小将极大振奋。他们积极酝酿准备进行徒步串连。十一月三日，我们的伟大领袖毛主席第六次检阅文化革命大军，林彪同志在大会上的讲话中传达了毛主席支持步行串连的喜讯，并且向革命师生和红卫兵战士发出有计划、有组织、有准备地进行步行串连的号召，更大大激发了广大革命小将参加徒步串连的坚定决心和刚强意志。现在，从祖国东北的哈尔滨到西南边陲的拉萨，从东海之滨的上海、福州到西北高原的兰州、西宁，从内蒙古的呼和浩特到中原重镇武汉、南方门户广州，全国各个地方成千上万的革命小将立下了跨越千山万水的雄心壮志。他们用“东方红”、“学红军”、“长征大学”、“火炬”、“接班人”、“红色娘子军”等响亮的名称，组成了步行串连的队伍，决心踏着革命前辈的足迹，向本省本地区的革命老根据地和边远地方，向无产阶级文化大革命的中心北京，向革命摇篮井冈山，向革命圣地延安等处进发，投身到群众中去学习，去磨炼，去传播文化大革命的火种。
    革命小将们决心不做温室里的花朵，要做高山上的劲松，迎接暴风雨的挑战，在步行串连的大学校中，经风雨，见世面，受锻炼。他们表示：长征的路，我们要亲自走一走；革命的风霜苦，我们要亲口尝一尝。要取回革命的经，播出革命的种，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。广大革命师生和红卫兵决心在步行串连中，广泛深入地接触群众，接触社会的各个方面，更好地向工农学习，更好地传播毛泽东思想，了解社会主义社会的阶级斗争，使自己更加深刻地领会毛主席的正确路线。
    各地革命师生和红卫兵牢记毛主席不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗的教导，对步行串连积极认真地做了准备。在一切准备工作中，他们特别强调做好思想准备，以毛泽东思想武装起来。北京、广州、乌鲁木齐、济南、呼和浩特等地大中学校红卫兵组织步行串连队时，反复地学习了毛主席的“老三篇”等著作。他们说：只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才能吃大苦，耐大劳，才能有坚强的革命意志，才能征服万水千山，胜利完成长征任务。小将们还认真学习了解放军三大纪律八项注意。许多地方的红卫兵和革命师生邀请老红军介绍了长征情况和行军知识。他们说，我们在步行串连中不但要像解放军那样为群众做好事，还要像解放军那样一路上宣传群众，密切联系群众，虚心向群众学习。他们决心在步行串连中活学活用毛主席著作，树立一心为人民，一心为革命的无产阶级世界观。
    许多红卫兵小将认真讨论了步行革命串连的伟大意义和做法。他们说，步行串连中宣传群众，也是教育自己，必须首先按照毛主席的指示去做：“要了解情况，唯一的方法是向社会作调查，调查社会各阶级的生动情况。”步行串连就是进行社会调查的最好办法，是无产阶级革命事业接班人的必修课。
    现在，各地准备步行串连的革命小将，决心以毛主席“长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机”的教导作为行动指南。参加长征队的革命小将，准备了钢板、蜡纸和油印机，印好了宣传品，排练了演唱节目，要像大连海运学院“长征红卫队”那样，走到那里，就在那里宣传毛泽东思想。（附图片）
