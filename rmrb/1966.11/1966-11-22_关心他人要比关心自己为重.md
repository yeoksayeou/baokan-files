I have a bicycle. Chen Chongwei, in order to innovate the technology of the dehydrator, rides it to the West Oil Depot to learn every day. His skills are not very good, and I do not want him to ride it, but I do not dare to say it out loud. In the evening, I secretly remove the air valve.

Holding the air valve in my hand, lying in bed, I could not sleep no matter what. At this time, Chairman Mao's words echoed in my ears: "Caring for the Party and the masses is more important than caring for oneself, and caring for others is more important than caring for oneself." Reflecting on myself, I have too much selfishness, even not wanting others to ride my bicycle. Thinking of this, I could not sleep anymore. I got up, installed the air valve, and filled the tire with air. The next morning, I handed the bicycle key to Chen Chongwei.

    关心他人要比关心自己为重
    油站班长　何大选
    我有一辆自行车，陈重威为了搞脱水器技术革新，每天骑着它到西油库学习。他的技术不大好，我不想叫他骑，又不好说出来。晚上，我就暗暗地把气嘴子卸下来了。
    手里拿着气嘴子，躺在床上，无论如何也睡不着。这时，毛主席的话响在我的耳边：“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。”对照检查，自己私心太重，连一个自行车也不想叫别人骑。想到这里，我再也睡不下去了，起来装好气嘴，打足气；第二天一早，我就把自行车的钥匙交给了陈重威。　（这一版的文章都是新华社稿）
