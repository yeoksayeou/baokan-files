	The broad revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have recently warmly hailed Chairman Mao's people's war thought as illuminating the path of struggle for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	A soldier on the front lines of the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation in South Vietnam said: "Chairman Mao's military thought is the most correct truth for the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations in their struggle for liberation. Chairman Mao's people's war thought is the magic weapon for the revolutionary peoples of the world to defeat the enemy. With Mao Zedong Thought, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America can avoid detours in their revolutions."

	A representative of the "June 14th" Revolutionary Movement in the Dominican Republic pointed out: "Mao Zedong's theory is a revolutionary theory, a fighting theory. Especially Chairman Mao's theory on armed struggle, it not only has great practical significance for the Dominican people, but also for all countries engaged in the struggle against imperialism and for national liberation."

	A freedom fighter from Southwest Africa said, "All patriotic fighters and cadres in Southwest Africa highly value Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings on the people's army, people's war, armed struggle, establishing revolutionary base areas, and the mass line. Revolutionary peoples of various countries have proven through their own experiences the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's judgments on imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers, on political power growing out of the barrel of a gun, and on the principle of self-reliance, and they regard Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings as the highest directive for their actions."

	A guerrilla fighter from Angola said: "From the bottom of our hearts, we regard Mao Zedong's strategic and tactical principles of people's war as the most important."

	A young person from Venezuela said: "We have accepted the revolutionary experience of the Chinese people and the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, which guide us to struggle for new victories. Now we have tens of thousands of young people who go to the mountains, take up arms, and fight against imperialism and reactionaries. Chairman Mao's books are deeply engraved in our minds."

	A Peruvian friend said: "Only armed struggle is the way out, the peasant question is the most important issue, and we must learn from the Chinese experience of surrounding the cities from the countryside."

	An Angolan guerrilla fighter, during a visit to China, enthusiastically said: "The truth that 'a single spark can start a prairie fire' I will always keep in my heart. I will go to the mountains upon my return to create our own Jinggangshan."

	General Singkapo of the Lao People's Liberation Army said: "We in the Lao People's Liberation Army have learned from the valuable experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in building armed forces and waging armed struggle, especially its resolute revolutionary spirit of long-term arduous struggle and self-reliance."

	A hero from South Vietnam said, "We have learned Chairman Mao's sixteen-character formula for guerrilla warfare, 'We not only used it in the past, but also use it now; not only in the countryside, but also in the cities; to attack the enemy's small strongholds and to fight against the enemy's large airfields.' A soldier from the South Vietnamese Liberation Army said: 'Even when the enemy attacks with several times our forces, we use Chairman Mao's strategic principles to defeat the enemy.'"

	Another friend from South Vietnam said: "The victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is the victory of Mao Zedong's people's war thought."

    亚非拉广大革命人民热烈欢呼
    毛主席的人民战争思想是争取解放的法宝
    新华社讯　最近亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的广大革命人民热烈欢呼毛主席的人民战争思想照亮了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的斗争道路。
    站在抗美救国斗争最前线的一位南越战士说：“毛主席的军事思想，是无产阶级和被压迫人民被压迫民族争取解放的最正确的真理。毛主席的人民战争思想，是世界革命人民战胜敌人的法宝。有了毛泽东思想，亚非拉人民的革命就可以少走弯路。”
    多米尼加“六月十四日”革命运动组织的一位代表指出：“毛泽东的理论是革命的理论，是战斗的理论。特别是毛主席关于武装斗争的理论，不仅对我们多米尼加人民有重大的现实意义，而且对所有正在进行反对帝国主义和争取民族解放斗争的国家都有重要意义。”
    西南非洲的一位自由战士说，西南非洲的“所有爱国战士和干部都极其重视毛泽东主席关于人民军队、人民战争、武装斗争、建立革命根据地和关于群众路线的教导。各国革命人民通过自己的经验证明毛泽东同志关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎、关于枪杆子里面出政权的论断以及关于自力更生的原理的正确，并且把毛泽东同志的教导作为自己行动的最高指示。”
    安哥拉的一位游击战士说：“我们从内心深处，把毛泽东关于人民战争的战略战术看得比什么都重要。”
    委内瑞拉的一位青年说：“我们接受了中国人民的革命经验和毛泽东同志的教导，它引导我们为争取新的胜利而斗争。我们现在有成千上万的青年，走进山区，拿起武器，同帝国主义和反动派进行搏斗。毛主席的书现在深深印在我们的头脑中。”
    一位秘鲁朋友说：“只有武装斗争才是出路，农民问题是最主要的问题，走农村包围城市的道路，要学习中国的经验。”
    一位安哥拉的游击战士在访问中国时热情奔放地说：“星星之火，可以燎原这句真理，我要永远记在心底。我回国就要上山去，创造我们自己的井冈山。”
    老挝人民解放军的辛加坡将军说：“我们老挝人民解放军学习了中国人民解放军建设武装力量和武装斗争的宝贵经验，特别是它坚决革命、长期艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神。”
    一位南越英雄说，我们学习了毛主席的游击战十六字诀，“不仅过去用，现在也用；不仅在农村用，在城市也用；打敌人的小据点用，干敌人大的飞机场也用。”一位南越解放军战士说：“敌人用几倍于我的兵力发动进攻，我们就是用毛主席的战略原则战胜了敌人的。”
    另一位南越的朋友说：“越南人民抗美救国斗争的胜利，就是毛泽东人民战争思想的胜利。”
