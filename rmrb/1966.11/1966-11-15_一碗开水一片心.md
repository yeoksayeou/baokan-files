We came to the capital of the red revolution from Tai'an, Shandong. Although we are far from home, in the capital, it feels like we are at home, and everywhere we feel warmth.

We went to Tiananmen Square to receive the inspection of our great leader Chairman Mao. The crowd numbered nearly two million people. We thought that with so many people, getting water might be difficult. However, the reality was completely different from our expectations. The people of Beijing voluntarily set up tea stations, with one every ten steps and one every hundred steps. They stood by the road, holding bowls of water in both hands, and brought bowl after bowl of boiling water to our lips, smiling warmly, showing boundless affection towards us. Seeing this, we were deeply moved. We felt that what we held in our hands was not just a bowl of steaming hot water, but the sincere hearts of the people of the capital!

Respectable revolutionary people of the capital, I salute you! I want to learn from your spirit of diligently serving the people, to be a good student of Chairman Mao for life, and to be a servant of the people for life.

    一碗开水一片心
    我们从山东泰安来到红色首都。虽然远离家乡，但在首都就像在自己家里一样，处处感到温暖。
    我们去天安门接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅，队伍近二百万人。我们以为人这样多，喝水可能会很困难。可是事实完全出于我们意料之外。北京人民自动组成了茶水站，十步一处，百步一站，他们双手捧着水碗，站在路旁，把一碗一碗的开水送到我们的嘴旁，满面笑容，对我们无限亲热。看到这种情形，我们非常感激。我们觉得，端在手里的，哪里是一碗热气腾腾的开水，简直就是首都人民的一片赤心啊！
    可敬的首都革命人民，我向你们致敬！我要学习你们勤勤恳恳为人民服务的精神，做一辈子毛主席的好学生，做一辈子人民的勤务员。
