	Learn and Apply: Heart Red and Will Firm
		—Recording a Study and Application Meeting on Eliminating the Self and Nurturing the Public in the First Platoon of a Certain Unit in the Chengdu Military Region

	Recently, the First Platoon of a certain unit in the Chengdu Military Region, which has consecutively won the title of "Four Good" for five years, organized a study and application meeting on eliminating the self and nurturing the public for soldiers in the Mao Zedong Thought study guidance class. Participants in the meeting were all soldiers who were previously illiterate or had very little education. In the guidance class, they repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and parts of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Their hearts were filled with red flags, and their minds were illuminated. Once they grasped the great Mao Zedong Thought, they became steadfast in their ideals and clear in their direction.

	The soldiers deeply felt that by firmly following the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially focusing on the "application" aspect, they could fight a good battle of eliminating the self and nurturing the public. They learned a few characters, a sentence, or a passage from the quotations and used these to transform their thoughts and improve their work, changing both their subjective and objective worlds.

	The following are excerpts from some comrades' speeches at the "Study and Application Meeting":

	One Account Book
		Soldier Chen Guangjin

	I was accustomed to labor in my village, and in the army, whether it was helping in the kitchen, planting vegetables, fetching water, sweeping the floor, or feeding pigs, I was willing to do it all. However, I treated doing good deeds like a work points account book in a production team. I thought, "At the end of the year, I'll add it up, and getting 'Five Good' won't be a problem, and joining the League will be guaranteed." Who would have thought that neglecting ideological transformation would result in not getting 'Five Good' at the end of the year, and no share in joining the League?

	After the annual assessment, the squad leader had a talk with me, saying, "Last year, you did well in all aspects and made rapid progress." Hearing these words, I didn't say anything, but in my heart, I grumbled: What rapid progress? The work is mine, but the honor belongs to others. At home, laboring and settling the work points account at the end of the year, grain and money are in hand. In the army, no matter how many good deeds I do, I can't get 'Five Good,' and I can't join the League. My thoughts were in turmoil, and my work was affected. The "account book" of doing good deeds became emptier and emptier. Just at this time, I entered the study guidance class, and the instructor organized us to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles." In studying the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao said: "Having done a little, one thinks one has done a great deal and wants to boast, and is afraid that others will not know." These words made my ears burn. I did good deeds, and though I didn't say it out loud, I was afraid that others wouldn't know, secretly keeping an "account book" in my mind. Isn't this exactly the kind of person Chairman Mao criticized? The great leader Chairman Mao repeatedly admonished us to serve the people wholeheartedly and to have no selfishness. However, in serving the people, I "added water," and in doing good deeds, I had selfish motives. The more I thought about it, the more uneasy I felt, realizing that this was not a small matter but a big issue of eliminating bourgeois ideology and establishing Mao Zedong Thought. I must correct this. From then on, I constantly sounded the alarm for selfish thoughts, asking myself about my motives for every action, gradually discarding this "account book."

    学了就用　心红志坚
    ——记解放军成都部队某部一连一次灭资兴无讲用会
    最近，连续五年荣获四好称号的成都部队某部一连团支部，组织学习毛主席著作辅导班的战士们，开了一次灭资兴无的讲用会。参加讲用会的，都是过去不识字或识字很少的战士。他们在辅导班里，反复学习了“老三篇”和《毛主席语录》的部分内容，心里插上了红旗，头脑里点亮了明灯。他们一旦掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，就变得心红志坚，方向明！
    战士们深刻体会到：坚决按照林彪副主席的指示活学活用毛主席著作，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫，就能打好灭资兴无的思想仗。他们学了几个字、一句话，一段语录、就用这几个字、一句话、一段语录来改造思想和改进工作，改造主观世界和客观世界。
    下面是这次“讲用会”上部分同志的发言：
    “一本账”
     战士　陈光进
    我在家劳动惯了，到部队无论是帮厨、种菜、打水、扫地、喂猪……我都爱干。但是，我把做好事当成生产队一本工分账本。心想，到年终拿出来算一算，评“五好”没问题，入团是稳的了。谁知，忽视了思想改造，年终“五好”不沾边，入团也没有我的份。
    总评后，班长找我摆龙门阵，说：“去年你各方面都不错，进步也很快。”听了这个话，我嘴里没说，可心里嘀咕：什么进步很快，干工作是我的，荣誉是别人的。在家劳动，年终结算工分账，粮食人民币一手拿。在部队做好事再多，“五好”评不上，入团入不了。思想很恼火，工作也受到影响，做好事的“账本”越来越空。正在这时，我进入了学习辅导班，辅导员组织我们学习“老三篇”。在学习《纪念白求恩》一文里，毛主席说：“出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道。”这几句话说得我耳根发红。我干了好事，嘴里虽没有说，心里却生怕人家不知道，悄悄在脑子里建立“一本账”，这不正是毛主席所批评的那种人吗？伟大领袖毛主席谆谆告诫我们要全心全意为人民服务，要毫无自私自利之心，但是，我在为人民服务中“掺了假”，在做好事中存在有私心。越想心里越不安，觉得这不是小事，关系到灭资产阶级思想、立毛泽东思想的大问题，一定要改正。从此，我处处为私心杂念敲警钟，每做一件事都要问一问自己动机如何，逐渐丢掉了这本“账”。
