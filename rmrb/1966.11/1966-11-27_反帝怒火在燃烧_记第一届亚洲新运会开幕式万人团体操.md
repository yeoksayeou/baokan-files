The flames of anti-imperialism burn bright
—Recording the mass gymnastics of the first Asian New Games opening ceremony

On the lush green field, 1,200 young students dressed in athletic uniforms were performing various beautiful gymnastics. At this moment, on a backdrop stage over 100 meters long and several dozen meters wide, 12,000 people used cards of various colors to form a striking giant image: on the left was the emblem of the New Emerging Forces Games, vivid and prominent, symbolizing the boundless vitality of the emerging forces in developing sports; on the right was a globe, with a tall and powerful Asian athlete standing on it. He kicked a filthy American flag off the globe with great force, shattering it into pieces. This giant painting reflected the common aspiration of the Asian people to break the monopoly of American imperialism and independently develop sports, and it was greeted with extremely enthusiastic applause from the 60,000 spectators.

This was a scene from the mass gymnastics performed by Cambodian friends at the opening ceremony of the first Asian New Emerging Forces Games held on November 25 at the Phnom Penh Comprehensive Sports Field, which attracted worldwide attention.

This mass gymnastics and pattern gymnastics, performed by more than 20,000 people, showcased the grandeur of the performance, the beauty of the patterns, and the richness of the dances. They sang the praises of the fighting friendship between the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their anti-imperialist struggle, demonstrated the firm will and victorious belief of the Asian and world peoples in resolutely opposing American imperialist aggression, and also sang the praises of the new spirit of the Cambodian people under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, who rejected "American aid" and worked hard to develop their national economy and culture.

This unprecedented mass gymnastics, themed "Prosperous Cambodia is Marching Forward," consisted of four chapters: Welcome, friends of the New Emerging Forces Games; Cambodia past and present; Forward, never retreat, defeat imperialist aggression; Wish Cambodia prosperity and strength.

The mass gymnastics began with thousands of female students, each holding a red flower wreath, joyfully running onto the field. They welcomed the guests with graceful dance movements and changing formations, their faces beaming with joy. As the young women danced beautifully, the backdrop stage displayed one vivid image after another. The Cambodian tricolor flag appeared, the giant slogan "Down with imperialism and colonialism" appeared, and the giant slogan "Welcome, friends of the New Emerging Forces Games!" appeared. When the emblem of the New Games, the flags of participating countries and regions, and the giant slogan "Long live the Asian New Games!" appeared, a group of young people, holding high the flags of all countries and regions participating in the Asian New Games, marched proudly into the field. The vast field was filled with flying flags and dancing wreaths, and the stands echoed with thunderous applause that lasted for a long time.

Next, 1,200 male students appeared on the field. They performed the miserable past of the Cambodian people being enslaved by colonialists with slow and heavy dance movements. The backdrop stage also displayed a scene of the ancient capital of Angkor under colonial rule. Through relentless struggle, the people finally won independence. Angkor appeared on the backdrop stage with a new look, and batch after batch of young men and women performed with joyful dance movements: blue water flowing into fields, increasing rice production; machines spinning, industrial production developing... The backdrop stage also displayed a series of colorful patterns, praising Cambodia's new achievements in self-reliance and national economic development.

However, while the Cambodian people were building their own country, they did not forget that American imperialism was rampant in the world. The backdrop stage displayed a giant, eye-catching slogan in Khmer, English, and French: "Forward, never retreat!" "Defeat all aggression!" With this call to battle, 1,200 Cambodian soldiers in green military uniforms marched onto the field. They performed military drills and various combat shooting actions with dance movements, ready to annihilate any invading aggressors at any time. The backdrop stage also coordinated with vivid patterns. A giant pattern showed the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America standing shoulder to shoulder, vigilantly watching the front, expressing the determination of the three continents to resist American imperialism. Many patterns praised and supported the heroic deeds of the people of South and North Vietnam in fighting against American aggression. At this time, two large-character slogans appeared on the backdrop: "Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people!" "Yankees, go home!"

Finally, all the participants in the mass gymnastics appeared on the field, dancing joyfully to the cheerful music. The Cambodian athletes then performed gymnastics to strengthen their bodies and defend their country. They also formed words in Khmer such as "Unity is strength." The backdrop stage displayed patterns such as "Wish Cambodia prosperity and strength" and a giant statue of Prince Sihanouk. At this moment, the venue was in a state of joyous excitement, with continuous applause. Everyone wished the Cambodian people to march forward and achieve greater success in the struggle against American imperialist aggression and in the path of self-reliance and national economic development!

    反帝怒火在燃烧
    ——记第一届亚洲新运会开幕式万人团体操
    在绿草如茵的广场上，身着运动员服装的一千二百名青年学生，正在进行各种健美的体操表演。就在这时候，长一百多米、宽几十米的背景台上，一万二千人用各种颜色的牌子组成了一幅醒目的巨大图案：左边是一个新兴力量运动会的大会徽，鲜明突出，象征着新兴力量人民发展体育事业的无限生命力；右边是一个地球，上面站着一个形象高大、结实有力的亚洲运动员，他用脚猛力一踢，把一面沾污地球的美国星条旗踢得粉碎。这幅巨画，反映了亚洲人民打破美帝国主义垄断，独立自主发展体育事业的共同愿望，受到了六万名观众极为热烈的鼓掌欢呼。
    这是二十五日在金边综合运动场举行的举世瞩目的第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会开幕式上，柬埔寨朋友们表演的万人团体操的一个镜头。
    这个有两万多人集体表演的团体操和图案操，他们以气势雄壮的表演，鲜艳美丽的图案，丰富多采的舞蹈，歌颂了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民在反帝斗争中的战斗友谊，表现了亚洲和世界人民坚决反对美帝国主义侵略的坚定意志和胜利信念，也歌颂了柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王领导下，摈弃“美援”，自力更生发展民族经济和文化的新精神。
    这个以“繁荣的柬埔寨在前进”为主题的规模空前的团体操，共分四个篇章：新兴力量运动会的朋友们，欢迎你们；柬埔寨今昔；前进，决不后退，击败帝国主义的侵略；祝柬埔寨繁荣富强。
    团体操一开始，数以千计的女学生，手握鲜红的花环，欢跃地奔向广场。她们以优美的舞姿、多变的队形，喜气盈盈地迎接贵宾。随着女青年的优美舞蹈，背景台上映出了一幅又一幅色彩鲜丽的图案。柬埔寨的三塔国旗出现了，“打倒帝国主义和殖民主义”的巨幅标语出现了，“新兴力量运动会的朋友们，欢迎您！”的巨幅标语出现了。当出现新运会的会徽、参加国和地区的旗帜和“亚洲新运会万岁！”的巨幅标语时，一群青年，高举着所有参加亚洲新运会的国家和地区的旗帜，昂首阔步走进广场。巨大的广场上，旗帜飘扬，花环舞动，看台上掌声雷鸣，经久不息。
    接着，一千二百名男学生出现在广场上，他们以缓慢沉重的舞蹈动作，表演着柬埔寨人民被殖民主义者奴役的悲惨的过去。背景台上也映出了一幅殖民主义统治下的古都吴哥的画面。人民经过前赴后继的斗争，终于赢得了独立。吴哥又以崭新的面貌出现在背景台上，一批又一批青年男女用欢快的舞姿，形象地表演出：蓝蓝的流水淌进农田，使稻米增产；机轮飞转，工业生产发展……等。背景台上，也变幻出一幅幅五光十色的图案，赞颂柬埔寨自力更生发展国民经济的新成就。
    然而，柬埔寨人在建设自己国家的同时，并没有忘记美帝国主义正在世界上横行霸道。背景台上，出现了巨大醒目的柬、英、法文标语：“前进，决不后退！”“击败一切侵略！”随着这战斗的召唤，一千二百名柬埔寨士兵，穿着绿色军装阔步迈进广场。他们用舞蹈动作，进行军事操练，并表演着各种战斗射击动作，准备随时消灭一切来犯的侵略者。背景台上也用鲜明的图案相配合。一幅巨大图案上画有亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民携手并肩警惕地注视着前方，表示亚非拉三洲人民抵抗美帝国主义的决心。有许多幅图案赞扬和支持越南南方和北方人民抗击美国侵略战争的英雄业绩。这时，背景牌上出现了两幅大字标语：“越南是越南人民的！”“美国佬，滚回去！”
    最后，所有参加团体操表演的人，一齐出现在广场上，和着欢乐的乐曲尽情地欢舞。柬埔寨的运动员们接着表演了努力锻炼身体、保卫祖国的体操。他们还用柬文排成“团结就是力量”等字样。背景台上又出现了“祝柬埔寨繁荣昌盛”等图案和西哈努克亲王的巨像。这时，会场一片欢腾，掌声不断，人们祝愿柬埔寨人民阔步前进，在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中和自力更生发展民族经济的道路上，取得更大的成就！
