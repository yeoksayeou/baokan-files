Revolution cannot fear hardship; if one fears hardship, one cannot revolutionize. Only by establishing the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people can one truly feel that suffering for the revolution is the greatest happiness.

A proletarian revolutionary soldier must possess the spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, consciously regarding suffering for the revolution as the greatest joy and highest enjoyment.

When I first joined the army, I found it a bit difficult to adapt to the hard and intense life. Comrades enthusiastically helped me. The political instructor explained to me the reasons for enduring hardship and for whom we endure it. He also recounted the family history of hardships. I recalled the old society, where my ancestors were all hired laborers, enduring beatings and humiliation, and my mother was forced to death by the landlord. I couldn't help but ask myself: Now, if you are afraid of a little hardship for the revolution, isn't this forgetting your roots? The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt. At this time, the company was organizing a study of the "Three Articles" by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said, "Our army is a people's army. It fights for the liberation of the people and works wholeheartedly for the people's interests." Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated my heart, making me understand the significance of suffering for the people. I thought: In the past, many revolutionary forerunners suffered greatly for the people's liberation, even sacrificing their lives. Today, for the people's interests, we must also, like our revolutionary predecessors, fear no hardship. The more we suffer, the more happiness we can bring to the people of China and the world.

Once the decision was made, I consciously began to train myself in practical work. When climbing mountains in full gear, I deliberately carried more things to increase the weight. During daily encounters with hard labor, I volunteered to do it. During construction, I carried stones and hauled sand and soil all day, with a very high workload. A sore developed on my waist, and the leaders and comrades wanted me to rest. But thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," I did not want to give up this good opportunity for training and continued to work with everyone. Sometimes, the wound hurt so much that I thought: This is a test of whether I can truly endure hardship for the revolution. Perseverance is victory! The engineering task was successfully completed, and seeing the fruits of labor, I felt an indescribable joy.

After more than a year of study and training, I finally understood: Whether one can endure hardship depends entirely on whether one understands for whom one is enduring it and whether one fears hardship in one's mind. If one fears hardship in one's mind, one's hands and feet will soften at the slightest difficulty. If one's mind is filled with Mao Zedong Thought and understands the significance of enduring hardship for the revolution and the people, one will fear no hardship, the more hardship, the more one will work hard, and the more one can endure hardship, the happier one will be.

    怎样对待艰苦？
    革命不能怕苦，怕苦就不能革命。只有树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想，才能真正感到为革命吃苦是最大的幸福。
    战士　张国祥
    一个无产阶级革命战士，必须具有一不怕苦，二不怕死的硬骨头精神，自觉地把为革命吃苦当成最大的乐事，最高的享受。
    刚到部队时，我有点过不惯艰苦紧张的生活。同志们热情地帮助我。指导员给我讲为什么要吃苦和为谁吃苦的道理，还给我摆苦难家史。我想起旧社会，祖祖辈辈当长工，挨打受气，母亲被地主活活逼死的悲惨情景，不禁责问自己：现在为革命吃点苦你就害怕，这不是忘本吗？越想越觉得惭愧。这时，连里正组织学习“老三篇”，毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”毛主席的教导，照亮了我的心坎，使我懂得了为人民吃苦的意义，我想：过去许多革命先烈为了人民的解放，吃了多少苦，甚至牺牲了生命，今天，我们为人民的利益，也必须像革命前辈那样不怕一切艰苦，我们多吃一点苦，就能为全中国和全世界人民多增加一分幸福。
    决心下了，我就自觉地在实际工作中锻炼。全副武装爬山，我专门多带点东西，多增加一点重量。平时遇到艰苦的劳动，我争着去干。施工的时候，成天背石头，挑砂土，劳动强度很大，我腰上长了个疮，领导和同志们要我休息。可是，想到毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，我就不愿放弃这个锻炼的好机会，仍然跟着大家一起干。有时，伤口疼得厉害，我就想：这是考验自己能不能真正为革命吃苦的时候，坚持就是胜利！工程任务胜利完成了，看到劳动的成果，心里有说不出的高兴。
    经过一年多的学习和锻炼，我才真正懂得：能不能吃苦，完全看自己懂不懂得为谁吃苦，看思想上怕不怕苦。思想上怕苦，一碰到困难，手脚就软了。头脑里有了毛泽东思想，懂得了为革命、为人民吃苦的意义，再苦也不怕，越苦越要加油干，越能吃苦，越是幸福。
