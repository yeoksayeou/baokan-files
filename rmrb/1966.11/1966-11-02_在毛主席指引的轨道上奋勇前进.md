The locomotive named after our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, "Mao Zedong No. 1," celebrated its 20th anniversary of being named on October 30 this year.

On October 30, the Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the Chinese Communist Party's Ministry of Railways held a celebration meeting in Beijing to joyously celebrate the great event of Comrade Lin Biao's inscription for the 20th anniversary of the naming of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive, and to warmly congratulate the 20th anniversary of the naming of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive.

The meeting distributed copies of Comrade Lin Biao's inscription, "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress," to over a thousand representatives present. The entire audience was stirred with excitement and sang the song "The East Is Red" in unison. The representatives present expressed their determination to thoroughly implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high, especially to study the "Three Articles" as a guiding principle, to achieve ideological transformation, to drive the revolutionary locomotive, and to advance with full steam ahead on the track guided by Chairman Mao.

The "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive was named after our great leader Chairman Mao on October 30, 1946. Over the past 20 years, this locomotive has, from the war years to the construction years, had five different locomotive drivers, but the crew of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, passed down Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, and achieved outstanding results in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments. They are the revolutionary locomotives on the railway transportation lines and are excellent examples for all railway workers to learn from.

Minister of Railways Lü Zhengao, in his speech at the celebration meeting, emphasized: On the occasion of celebrating the 20th anniversary of the naming of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive, our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, inscribed: "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." This is a great encouragement and the most important instruction to all railway workers nationwide. We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and be good locomotives for the people's revolutionary progress in history! On behalf of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Railways, Lü Zhengao extended warm congratulations to the crew of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive. He said: The workers of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive crew have, over the past 20 years, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieved outstanding results in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments. They are indeed a fighting collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought and are revolutionary locomotives on the railway transportation lines.

Lü Zhengao called on all railway workers nationwide to learn from the crew of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive, to always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, and to take Mao Zedong Thought as their guide to action.

He said: At present, we must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call and raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. He said, Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are extremely important and timely. Our railway workers' study of Chairman Mao's works is far from being as good as that of the PLA. We must actively respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, truly learn and master Mao Zedong Thought, and turn all railway lines into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, promote revolution, and production, and strive for victory in both the cultural revolution and transportation production.

Cai Lianxing, the current locomotive driver of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive crew, spoke on behalf of all the workers and said that they would definitely study from the PLA, learn from Daqing, learn from the 32111 Hero Drilling Team, and humbly learn from advanced collectives, advanced individuals, and revolutionary masses nationwide, never be complacent, and always move forward. They would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, make their thoughts red, and serve the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly for life. Cai Lianxing said, they would definitely implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, study the "Three Articles" as a guiding principle, and work hard on transforming their worldview. They would use Mao Zedong Thought to forge their crew into a revolutionary collective with no "I," selfless, and serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly. They would be good locomotives for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They would pledge to the Party: Their hearts would be like sunflowers, always facing the red sun. Chairman Mao's works are the family treasure of their crew. Everyone would better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and resolutely transform themselves. They would name their thoughts after Chairman Mao's glorious name, turn the "Mao Zedong No. 1" crew into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure that it would never fade or change.

Cai Lianxing expressed that they would rather die than give up Mao Zedong Thought; the sea could dry up, and the rocks could crumble, but their resolve to defend Mao Zedong Thought would never change! They would remember Chairman Mao's teachings, care about state affairs, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Together with the revolutionary masses, they would promote revolution, production, and strive for victory on both the spiritual and material fronts.

Representatives from the State Council for Economic Construction, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and other units, as well as representatives from some units of the railway system, all spoke at the meeting, warmly praising the advanced deeds of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive crew over the past 20 years.

The Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the Chinese Communist Party's Ministry of Railways presented each member of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive crew with a bound copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and awarded the crew a banner. The banner read: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be the locomotive for studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought!"

The second and third locomotive drivers of the "Mao Zedong No. 1" locomotive crew, Li Yong, Vice Chairman of the China Railway Trade Union, and Guo Shude, Director of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, also attended the meeting. Over 200,000 railway workers and their families from all over the country listened to the live broadcast of the celebration meeting.
