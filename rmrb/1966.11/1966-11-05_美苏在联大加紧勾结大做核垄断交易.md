After China successfully tested missile nuclear weapons, the United States and the Soviet Union intensified their collusion at the United Nations to push for a so-called treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

Under the manipulation of the US and the Soviet Union, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly hastily passed a resolution on the 2nd, "urgently appealing to all countries" to "take all necessary steps to promote and conclude as soon as possible a treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons" and "not to take any actions that may promote the proliferation of nuclear weapons or hinder the achievement of a non-proliferation agreement."

This proposal was first put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on September 23rd at the General Assembly.

Albanian representative Budo spoke before the vote in the Political Committee, opposing this resolution. He sternly exposed and condemned the collusion between the US and the Soviet Union in concocting this resolution. He pointed out that whether it is the resolution concocted by the US and the Soviet Union together, or the non-proliferation treaty they are trying to push through, it is all for the purpose of maintaining their nuclear monopoly, so that they can continue to engage in nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats against the peoples of all countries.

The US and Soviet representatives spoke before and after the vote, praising this resolution. Soviet representative Fedlin advocated for making "new major efforts" to finally conclude a treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He boasted that "this agreement will close the door to the spread and proliferation of these weapons."

The Political Committee of the General Assembly began debating nuclear disarmament on October 20th. Soviet representative Fedlin emphasized at the outset the Soviet side's eagerness to make a deal with the United States on the issue of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In his speech on October 20th, he repeatedly emphasized that "all the prerequisites for solving this problem are now in place" and that "there are no insurmountable difficulties in solving this problem." The Soviet representative's stance of betraying the interests of the world's revolutionary peoples was praised by the US and other Western countries' representatives. US representative Goldberg praised Fedlin's speech as a "constructive speech" and therefore expressed "optimism" about the prospect of signing a treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

### 美苏在联大加紧勾结大做核垄断交易

    美苏在联大加紧勾结大做核垄断交易
    阿尔巴尼亚代表严正谴责苏美串通一气搞防止核扩散的阴谋
    苏联代表背叛世界革命人民利益的立场受到美国代表的赞赏
    据新华社三日讯　纽约消息：在中国成功地试验了导弹核武器之后，美苏两国在联合国内加紧了它们在缔结一项所谓防止核武器扩散条约问题上的勾结。
    在美苏合谋操纵下，联合国大会政治委员会二日匆匆通过一项决议，“紧急呼吁一切国家”“采取一切必要步骤来促进和尽早缔结一项关于不扩散核武器条约”和“不要采取任何助长核武器的扩散或可能妨碍达成不扩散核武器的协议的行动”。
    这个提案最早是由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯九月二十三日在大会提出的。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表布多在政治委员会表决前发言，反对这一决议。他严正揭露和谴责了苏美勾结炮制这个决议的阴谋。他指出，无论是美苏合伙搞出的这一决议，还是它们企图搞成的防止核扩散条约，都是为了保持它们的核垄断地位，以便于它们继续对世界各国人民进行核讹诈和核威胁。
    美苏代表在表决前后分别发言，吹捧这一决议。苏联代表费德林鼓吹要继续作出“新的重大努力”，以便最后缔结防止核扩散条约。他吹嘘“这个协议，将紧闭这种武器散布和扩散的大门。”
    联大政委会是从十月二十日开始辩论核裁军问题的。苏联代表费德林一开始就强调表示了苏联方面急于在防止核武器扩散问题上同美国作成交易的心情。他在十月二十日的发言中反复强调说，目前已经具备了解决这个问题的“一切先决条件”，“在解决这个问题方面，没有不可克服的困难”。苏联代表叛卖世界革命人民利益的立场，得到美国以及其他西方国家代表的赞赏。美国代表戈德堡称赞费德林的发言是“建设性的发言”，并且因此对签订一项防止核武器扩散条约的前景表示“乐观”。
