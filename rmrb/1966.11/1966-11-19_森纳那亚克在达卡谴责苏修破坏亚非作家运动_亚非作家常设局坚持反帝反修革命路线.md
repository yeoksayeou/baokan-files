Senanayake Condemns Soviet Revisionists' Sabotage of Asian-African Writers' Movement
Asian-African Writers' Bureau Persists in Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Revisionist Revolutionary Line

DACCA, Nov. 17 (New China News Agency) — The Secretary-General of the Asian-African Writers' Bureau, Senanayake, strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's attempt to split the Asian-African writers' movement on Nov. 16. He declared that the Bureau would resolutely carry on the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism to the end.

He made the statement at a reception held by the Pakistan Writers' Association to welcome the Asian-African writers' delegation. Over a hundred writers, artists, and other cultural workers attended the reception.

He said the struggle of the Asian-African peoples against imperialism and colonialism has entered a new stage. The revolutionary spirit of the Asian-African peoples will certainly be reflected in progressive literature and art.

Senanayake said the guiding principle of the Asian-African writers' movement is based on the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and for national independence and liberation. This guiding principle is revolutionary, and it requires progressive writers in the Asian-African region to support the struggle of the Asian-African peoples against imperialism and colonialism through their literary and artistic activities.

He said a small clique of Soviet revisionists, in collusion with the imperialists, are trying to split the Asian-African writers' movement and divert it from its revolutionary course.

After citing facts to expose the Soviet revisionists' despicable plot to split and sabotage the Asian-African writers' movement, he pointed out that they are doomed to failure because they go against the firm will of the Asian-African peoples who are waging a struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Their actions are beneficial to imperialism and serve imperialism. In short, the revisionists have become the running dogs of imperialism.

Senanayake said the Asian-African Writers' Bureau will resolutely carry through the revolutionary line of struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism. He called on revolutionary writers in the Asian-African region to unite to defend the revolutionary line of the Asian-African writers' movement and thoroughly smash the Soviet revisionists' splitting activities.

Senanayake's speech was greeted with warm applause by those present at the reception.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Dacca, the Asian-African writers' delegation, led by the Secretary-General of the Asian-African Writers' Bureau, Senanayake, arrived in Dacca, the capital of East Pakistan, on the evening of Nov. 15 at the invitation of the Pakistan Writers' Association.

The delegation was warmly welcomed at the airport by the honorary executive secretary of the Pakistan Writers' Association, Shokat Siddiqui, and writers and poets from Dacca. As the delegates stepped off the plane, the welcoming crowd shouted, "Long live Asian-African unity!" "Down with American imperialism!"

Sarhaduddin Muhammad, a member of the executive committee of the Pakistan Writers' Association, made a brief speech at the airport to welcome the delegation. He said the delegation's visit would further strengthen the fighting unity of the Asian-African writers and peoples who are struggling against imperialism and old and new colonialism.

In his reply at the airport, Senanayake said the common task facing the Asian-African writers and peoples is to struggle against all imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism. He said the forces obstructing the struggle of the Asian-African peoples for independence, freedom, and liberation are imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism.

    森纳那亚克在达卡谴责苏修破坏亚非作家运动
    亚非作家常设局坚持反帝反修革命路线
    新华社达卡十七日电　亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克十六日在这里发表谈话，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团分裂亚非作家运动，表示亚非作家常设局要坚决把反对帝国主义、殖民主义和修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    他是在巴基斯坦作家同人会举行的欢迎亚非作家代表团的招待会上发表谈话的。有一百多位作家、艺术家和其他文艺工作者出席了招待会。
    他说，亚非人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的胜利斗争正在进入一个新阶段。亚非人民的这种斗争和他们的革命精神必定在进步的文学和艺术中反映出来。
    森纳那亚克说，亚非作家运动的指导方针是建立在反对帝国主义、殖民主义、争取民族独立和解放的斗争的基础上的。这个指导方针是革命的方针，它要求亚非地区的进步作家通过自己在文学和艺术方面的活动支持亚非人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。
    他说，苏联的一小撮修正主义分子同帝国主义者一道，正在一心企图分裂亚非作家运动，转移运动的革命方向。
    他在列举事实揭露苏联修正主义者分裂和破坏亚非作家运动的卑鄙阴谋后指出，他们是注定要失败的，因为他们违背了正在同帝国主义和殖民主义进行斗争的亚非人民的坚强意志。他们这种做法是有利于帝国主义的，是为帝国主义服务的。总之，修正主义者已成为帝国主义的帮凶。
    森纳那亚克说，亚非作家常设局坚决要把反对帝国主义、殖民主义和修正主义的革命路线贯彻到底。他呼吁亚非地区的革命作家团结在保卫亚非作家运动革命路线的周围，彻底粉碎苏联修正主义者的分裂活动。
    森纳那亚克的讲话博得了参加招待会的人的热烈鼓掌。
    据新华社达卡电　由亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克率领的亚非作家代表团应巴基斯坦作家同人会的邀请，十五日晚乘飞机抵达东巴基斯坦首府达卡进行友好访问。
    代表团在机场受到巴基斯坦作家同人会名誉执行秘书肖卡特·西迪基以及达卡的作家和诗人的热烈欢迎。当代表们走下飞机时，欢迎的人群高呼：“亚非团结万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”
    巴基斯坦作家同人会执行委员会委员萨拉胡丁·穆罕默德在机场发表了欢迎代表团的简短讲话。他说，代表团的来访将进一步加强正在为反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义而斗争的亚非作家和人民的战斗团结。
    森纳那亚克在机场致答词时说，亚非作家和人民面临的共同任务是同一切帝国主义、殖民主义和修正主义作斗争。他说，阻挠亚非人民争取独立、自由和解放的斗争的是帝国主义、殖民主义和修正主义。
