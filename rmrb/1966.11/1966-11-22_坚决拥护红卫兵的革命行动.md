Recently, our most beloved and respected Chairman Mao Zedong, accompanied by his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao and other comrades, attended a mass rally of a million people composed of the powerful Red Guards. I extend my warmest greetings to Chairman Mao and resolutely agree with and support all the actions of the Red Guards in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

I firmly believe that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely correct. All the workers, peasants, and soldiers across China support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards have resolutely followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. I call out to the Red Guards: Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward to victory!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao Zedong is aimed at smashing the reactionaries, the rightist elements of the bourgeoisie, and the running dogs of revisionism, eliminating all feudal and decayed old customs and habits, and establishing revolutionary new customs and habits, to achieve a communist society!

    坚决拥护红卫兵的革命行动
    最近，我们最敬爱的最尊敬的毛泽东主席，由他亲密的战友林彪同志以及其他同志陪同，参加了由强大的红卫兵组成的百万群众大会。我最最热烈地向毛主席问候，最热烈地和坚决地同意和拥护红卫兵在无产阶级文化大革命中的一切行动。
    我坚信，无产阶级文化大革命是完全正确的。全中国的工农兵都支持红卫兵的革命行动。在无产阶级文化大革命中，红卫兵们坚决地遵循了伟大领袖毛泽东主席的教导。我向红卫兵们高呼：更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗胜利前进！
    毛泽东主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命就是为了粉碎反动派、资产阶级右派分子和修正主义走狗，消灭一切封建的腐朽的旧习惯和旧风俗，建立革命的新习惯和新风俗，以达到共产主义社会！
