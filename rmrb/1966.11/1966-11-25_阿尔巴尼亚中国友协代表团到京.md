A delegation from the Albania-China Friendship Association, led by Petrit Dode, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Korça District People's Assembly Executive Committee, arrived in Beijing tonight by plane. The delegation of six members was invited by the China-Albania Friendship Association to visit China for a friendly tour. Over 300 revolutionary masses and Red Guards from the capital braved the cold wind to welcome the Albanian comrades at the airport, holding up Chairman Mao's quotations and red flags.

When the plane carrying the guests landed, the welcoming crowd waved copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beat drums, and repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Mao Zedong—Enver" and "Enver—Mao Zedong." The Albanian comrades enthusiastically waved back to the welcoming crowd.

Present at the airport to welcome the delegation were Liu Xiao, Chu Tu-nan, Sung Yi-ping, Ho Piao, and Ting Kuo-yi, and other relevant officials. The Albanian Charge d'Affaires, Mr. Baba, was also at the airport to welcome the delegation.
