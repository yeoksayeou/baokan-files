	* Brilliant, brilliant! Comrade Mao Zedong is truly a great helmsman. The Chinese people have such a leader, how fortunate!
	* The masses are our blood supply. Such a situation in the history of surgery is simply unprecedented. In Spain, we did not think of this move. Chairman Mao said, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and any difficulty can be overcome. What a great idea!
	* To make a revolution, one cannot first consider personal safety. Fighting against fascism is not safe. If I had considered personal safety, I would not have come to China. Only by eliminating fascism can there be reliable safety. Communist Party members cannot first think of their own safety.
	* Revolutionary fraternity knows no borders.
	* You and we are all internationalists. No racial, skin color, language, or national boundaries can separate us. The fascists are threatening world peace, and we must defeat them.
	* I came to China not only for you but also for us. I want to show you: we will fight side by side with Chinese comrades until the war of resistance is won. As long as the Japanese fascists have not been driven out of China, we will not leave. Today we support you, and in the future, when you are victorious, you will support us in the same way.
	* I came to support the Chinese national liberation war. What do I need money for? If I wanted to dress well and eat well, I would not have come to China from Canada.
	* The soldiers on the front lines are not afraid of shedding blood and sacrificing themselves, bravely fighting the enemy. We, working in the rear, what is the big deal if we do not sleep for three or five nights? ... To save a wounded soldier, to reduce the pain of a wounded soldier by one bit, is the greatest joy for us medical workers.
	* What is the responsibility of a doctor, a nurse, a medic? The responsibility is to make your patients happy, to help them recover their health, to regain their strength. You must treat each patient as your brother, your father. Because, in reality, they are even more dear to you—they are your comrades. In all things, you must put them first. If you do not regard them as more important than yourself, then you are not fit to work in the medical field, and you are simply not fit to work in the Eighth Route Army.
	* The era of a revolutionary doctor sitting at home waiting for patients to knock on the door is over. Our battle cry for the future is: go to the front lines, go to where the wounded are. Wherever there are wounded soldiers, we will go there!
	* Do not treat me as an antique. I am here to work. You should use me like a top-notch machine gun.
	* You Chinese have a good saying: “Live to learn, learn to live!”
	* It is better to do one thing than to say a hundred empty words.
	* We must stay alert and never become complacent due to current successes; do not deceive ourselves, do not confuse subjective wishes with actual achievements. Therefore, in our criticism, we must be ruthless, and severely criticize all personal vanity. Do not care about age, position, or qualifications if they hinder our work. We must test all our theories in practice, only then can our thoughts reflect reality.

    共产主义战士——白求恩同志的话
    ＊英明，英明！毛泽东同志真是伟大的舵手。中国人民有了这样的领袖，多么幸福！
      ＊群众是我们的血库，这样的情况在外科医学的历史上，简直是创举。在西班牙，我们没有想到这一着。毛主席说，发动群众，依靠群众，什么困难都是可以战胜的，这是多么伟大的思想啊！
    ＊闹革命就不能先顾个人的安全。和法西斯作战，就不安全。如果为了个人安全，我就不到中国来了。只有消灭法西斯，才有可靠的安全。共产党员不能首先为个人的安全着想。
    ＊革命友爱，不分中外。
    ＊你们和我们都是国际主义者。没有任何种族、肤色、语言和国家的界限能把我们分开。法西斯们在威胁世界和平，我们必须击败他们。
    ＊我来中国，不仅是为了你们，也是为了我们。我要向你们表示：我们要和中国同志并肩战斗，直到抗战胜利。日本法西斯一天不赶出中国，我们一天不离开。今天我们支援你们，将来你们胜利了，会同样支援我们的。
    ＊我是来支援中国民族解放战争的，我要钱做什么？如果我要穿好吃好，就在加拿大不来了。
    ＊将士们在前方不怕流血牺牲，英勇杀敌，我们在后方工作，三、五个晚上不睡觉，又有什么关系呢？……能抢救一个伤病员，为伤病员减轻一分痛苦，就是我们医务工作者最大的愉快。
    ＊一个医生、一个护士、一个卫生员的责任是什么？那责任就是使你的病人快乐，帮助他们恢复健康，恢复力量。你必须把每一个病人看作是你的兄弟、你的父亲。因为，实在说，他们比兄弟、父亲还要亲切些——他们是你的同志。在一切的事情当中，要把他们放在最前头。你不把他们看得重于自己，那么，你就不配从事卫生事业，也简直就不配在八路军工作。
    ＊一个革命医生，坐在家里，等待病人来叩门的时代已经过去了。我们今后的战斗口号是：到前线去，到伤员那儿去。哪里有伤员，我们就到哪儿去！
    ＊你们不要把我当成古董。我是来工作的，你们要拿我当一挺顶呱呱的机关枪使用。
    ＊你们中国有句俗语说得好：活到老，学到老嘛！
    ＊说一百句空话，不如动手做一件事。
    ＊我们要提高警惕，千万不要由于目前的成功而乱打如意算盘；不要欺骗自己，不要把主观愿望和实际成就混为一谈。因此，我们在批评当中要毫不留情，要狠狠地批评一切个人虚荣心。不要管年纪、地位和资格，倘使它们阻碍我们工作的发展。我们必须把所有的理论都拿到实践中去检验，唯有这样，我们的思想才能反映现实。
