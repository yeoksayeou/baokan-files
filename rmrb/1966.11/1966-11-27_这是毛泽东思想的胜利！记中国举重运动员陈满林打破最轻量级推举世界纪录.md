This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought!
Record of Chinese Weightlifter Chen Manlin Breaking the Lightweight Press World Record

On the first day of the first Asian New Forces Games, our lightweight weightlifter Chen Manlin achieved an outstanding result of 118.5 kilograms, breaking his own world record of 118 kilograms in the lightweight press, adding new luster to the history of world weightlifting.

On the evening of the 26th, the grand hall of the People's Social Alliance in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, was brightly lit. Athletes from various Asian countries with a glorious anti-imperialist tradition gathered here with the desire to learn from each other and improve together for the lightweight weightlifting competition.

At 7:45 PM, the scoreboard on the weightlifting platform showed 110 kilograms. At this moment, our excellent athlete Chen Manlin walked onto the weightlifting platform. His first attempt was unsuccessful, but he did not lose heart. After carefully considering the reasons for the failure, he walked back to the barbell and easily lifted it. Then, he asked the referee for 118.5 kilograms, which was 0.5 kilograms more than the 118-kilogram lightweight press world record he set last year. The barbell, after being weighed by the referees, was accurately increased to 118.5 kilograms.

At 7:50 PM, Chen Manlin confidently walked back to the barbell. The barbell shone brightly under the bright lights. The audience held their breath and focused their attention on Chen Manlin, who was wearing a blue weightlifting suit. They saw him suddenly lift the barbell with his iron-like arms, stand up, and push it over his head. "Success!" The referee gave the command to put down the barbell. At this moment, the three white lights indicating the referees' approval of the result lit up simultaneously. Immediately, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause. The entire audience stood up, enthusiastically cheering for the birth of the first world record at the first Asian New Forces Games. After re-weighing, Chen Manlin's weight was found to be completely in accordance with the international regulations, not exceeding 56 kilograms. People enthusiastically walked up to shake hands with Chen Manlin and congratulate him warmly.

After leaving the weightlifting platform, Chen Manlin shared his thoughts with a reporter from our newspaper, saying, "This result is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought!"

Chen Manlin is 25 years old. He is an outstanding member of the Communist Youth League who has grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and has achieved outstanding results in the world of weightlifting many times. When the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was vigorously unfolding in our country, he actively participated in this revolutionary movement and seriously studied the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team. He said, "I will read Chairman Mao's books more diligently, listen to Chairman Mao's words, fear no difficulties, dare to climb mountains of knives, and dare to plunge into seas of fire, and trample difficulties underfoot." After arriving in Phnom Penh, he and his companions studied Chairman Mao's works "Three Articles" in combination with their own thoughts, always paying attention to overcoming their selfish desires and transforming their subjective world. In a study session on "Three Articles," he said, "Only with a firm ideology can one truly have solid skills. One must discard the 'self,' eliminate selfish desires, and regard the training ground and the competition arena as a battlefield for ideological transformation!" Chen Manlin's ability to create a world record again is the result of his active study and application of Chairman Mao's works.

Chen Manlin's outstanding achievement today has been warmly praised. The chief referee of the weightlifting competition, Ega Jun (Japan), told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, "Chen Manlin created a world record on the first night of the competition, which is great. He said, 'This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought!' The leader of the Sri Lankan weightlifting team told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, "Great! I hope the first Asian New Forces Games will continue to achieve excellent results."

China's famous female archer Li Shulan said, "Chen Manlin's successful press today is the result of his diligent study of Mao Zedong Thought, demonstrating the great power of Mao Zedong Thought."

    这是毛泽东思想的胜利！
    记中国举重运动员陈满林打破最轻量级推举世界纪录
    在第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会比赛的第一天，我国最轻量级举重运动员陈满林以一百一十八点五公斤的优异成绩，打破了他自己保持的一百一十八公斤的举重最轻量级推举世界纪录，为世界举重运动史增添了新的光辉。
    二十六日晚上，柬埔寨首都金边人民社会同盟大礼堂里灯火辉煌，来自具有光荣反帝斗争传统的亚洲各国的举重运动员，抱着互相学习、共同提高的愿望，在这里进行最轻量级举重比赛。
    七时四十五分，举重比赛台上的挂分牌出现了一百一十公斤的数字，这时，我国优秀运动员陈满林走到了举重比赛台上。他的第一次试举没有成功，但是，他没有灰心，在认真思考没有成功的原因以后，又一次走到了杠铃前面，接着就轻松地把它举起来了。随后，他向裁判要了一百一十八点五公斤的重量，这个重量比他在去年创造的一百一十八公斤的最轻量级推举世界纪录多零点五公斤。杠铃经过裁判们的称量，准确无误地增加到一百一十八点五公斤。
    七时五十分钟，陈满林又满怀信心地走到了杠铃前。杠铃在明亮的日光灯的照耀下，闪闪发光。观众屏息静气地把目光投向身穿蓝色举重服的陈满林。只见他那铁臂似的双手猛地翻起杠铃，起立、上推，一下子就把超过自己体重一倍多的杠铃举过了头顶。“成功了！”发令裁判发出了可以把杠铃放下的口令。这时，表示裁判们承认这个成绩的三盏白光灯同时亮了起来。顿时，全场爆发出雷鸣般的掌声，全场观众起立，热烈欢呼第一届亚洲新运会第一个世界纪录的诞生。经过再次称量以后，陈满林的体重完全合乎体重的国际规定，没有超过五十六公斤。人们热情地走上前去同陈满林握手，向他表示热烈的祝贺。
    陈满林离开举重台后，对本社记者谈了他的感想，他说：“我的这个成绩是毛泽东思想的胜利！”
    陈满林今年二十五岁，他是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的优秀的共青团员，多次为世界举重事业创造了优异成绩。当史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命在我国轰轰烈烈地展开以后，他积极地参加了这个革命运动，并且在运动中认真地学习了32111钻井队的英雄事迹。他说：“我要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，不怕任何困难，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，把困难踩在脚下。”这次到金边以后，他和同伴们又结合自己的思想活学活用毛主席著作“老三篇”，随时注意克服自己的私心杂念，改造自己的主观世界。他在一次学习“老三篇”的讲用会上说：“只有思想过硬，技术才能真正过硬，一定要抛掉‘我’字，清除私心杂念，把训练场地和比赛场地当作改造思想的战场！”陈满林能够再次创造世界纪录，正是他活学活用毛主席著作的结果。
    陈满林今天创造的优异成绩，受到了人们的热烈赞扬。举重比赛总裁判长额贺勋（日本）对新华社记者说，陈满林在比赛的第一天晚上就创造了世界纪录，太好了。他说：这是毛泽东思想的胜利！锡兰举重队领队对新华社记者说：太好了。我希望第一届亚洲新运会继续取得优秀的成绩。
    中国著名女射箭运动员李淑兰说：陈满林今天推举成功，这是他平时努力学习毛泽东思想的结果，显示了毛泽东思想的伟大威力。　·新华社记者·
