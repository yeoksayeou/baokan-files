We watched the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Harbor," and our hearts were deeply moved. This play depicts the struggles of Shanghai dockworkers in the 1960s, reflecting their spirited demeanor and global vision under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Among the characters, the foreman of the loading and unloading team, Gao Zhiyang, left a particularly deep impression on the audience.

The play tells the story of workers in a loading and unloading area of Shanghai Port during an incident involving the scattering of bags of grain while they were rushing to load aid for foreign countries. It vividly portrays Gao Zhiyang standing on the dock, with a heart full of patriotism and eyes scanning the world, embodying the revolutionary spirit of "even if the sky falls, we will hold it up." It showcases the internationalist spirit of the Chinese working class in actively supporting the world revolution.

As the curtain rises, Gao Zhiyang gazes at the bustling "thousands of wheels and tens of thousands of ships" in Shanghai Port. To support the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, he leads his team in selflessly loading cargo. "For the revolution, even if mountains high and seas wide stand in the way, we will surely deliver our deep affection to every corner of the world!" This broad-minded hero immediately leaves a deep impression on the audience.

"Rush to the riverbank for emergency loading, the foreign ship needs to depart early, dark clouds roll in and the weather changes, a thunderstorm is about to hit the harbor. Rice needs to be loaded onto the ship quickly, wheat needs to be moved into the warehouse swiftly"—faced with this urgent task of rushing to load and unload aid for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Gao Zhiyang volunteers to take on the heavy responsibility. When the loading team leader Zhao Zhenshan expresses concern about completing the task and mentions that there aren't enough machines, Gao Zhiyang and his team immediately offer all their machines to others. They use their shoulders to carry two thousand bags of wheat, one by one, into the harbor warehouse. Gao Zhiyang says with great generosity, "To support the world revolution, even if it means climbing mountains of knives and crossing seas of fire, the working class will not hesitate! Carrying a few bags, what's the big deal?"

Here, we not only see Gao Zhiyang's noble quality of facing difficulties head-on and letting others have the convenience, but also the internationalist spirit of the Chinese working class, who are wholeheartedly dedicated to serving the world revolution!

Just as the emergency loading is completed, Gao Zhiyang suddenly discovers that "someone scattered the bags." A sense of extreme responsibility towards the people of the world revolution makes him unable to suppress his inner excitement: "Seeing the wheat scattered on the ground, I am both anxious and angry. The overseas task has high standards, how can scattered bags pass inspection?" Meanwhile, the warehouse manager Qian Shouwei, who is full of bourgeois thoughts, gleefully says that the dock cannot be managed by workers. Gao Zhiyang hears this and a strong proletarian sentiment surges in his chest. He declares, "If we can't find out who scattered the bags, it would be a disgrace to the class and the Party. Even if it's a needle at the bottom of the sea, I will turn the sea over to find it!"

This small incident of scattered bags may seem trivial to some, but to Gao Zhiyang, it is as heavy as Mount Tai. With a sense of responsibility as the master of the house, he consciously realizes, "Overseas tasks should be strictly followed, the political impact is as heavy as the sky!" Therefore, he sets aside his personal matters, such as his child being sick and needing to be taken to the hospital, and under the leadership and support of the party branch, he mobilizes the workers to search the warehouse overnight, determined to find the scattered bags and eliminate the accident.

However, when the accident is discovered, the scattered wheat has already been mistakenly loaded onto the barge as rice, and the barge has sailed out of the Huangpu River. At this moment, the customs bell rings three times, and in just over two hours, the foreign ship carrying this batch of rice will set sail for Africa. Gao Zhiyang's heart burns with urgency. In this critical moment, he thinks, "The barge is loaded with the honor of our motherland, we cannot let the scattered bags leave a stain." "The barge carries revolutionary friendship, how can we let the scattered bags leave a stain!" Driven by a high sense of responsibility for the honor of the motherland and international duty, Gao Zhiyang bravely steps forward, facing the thunder, lightning, and torrential rain of the night. He drives a speedboat, finally catches up with the barge, retrieves the scattered bags, and eliminates the accident.

Gao Zhiyang, relying on the great Mao Zedong Thought, overcomes one difficulty after another. His heroic character of "knowing the dangers of the surging waves, yet daring to sail on the stormy sea" is a manifestation of his unlimited loyalty to the socialist cause of our motherland and the support of the world revolution. This image is a true reflection of today's Chinese workers, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, completely and thoroughly serving all the people of China and the world. It is also a vivid summary of the billions of Chinese people actively learning and applying the "Three Articles," establishing a revolutionary worldview of "selflessness and dedication to others."

"The Harbor" uses the Beijing opera form to vividly reflect the spiritual face of Chinese workers in the 1960s, creating such a lifelike heroic worker image, which is a delightful achievement.

    毛泽东时代的海港工人形象
    北京火车站装卸工人　张宗印　陆炳文
    看了革命现代京剧《海港》，心情非常激动。这个戏表现了六十年代上海码头工人的斗争生活，反映了他们在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，意气风发的精神面貌和放眼世界的革命胸怀。其中，装卸组长高志扬给观众留下了尤为深刻的印象。
    这出戏通过上海港某装卸区工人在一次消灭抢运援外货物中所发生散包事件的故事，集中描绘了装卸组长高志扬站在码头，胸怀祖国，眼望世界，满怀“天塌下来我们顶得住”的革命豪情，表现了我国工人阶级积极支援世界革命的国际主义精神。
    帷幕一拉开，高志扬眺望着“千轮万船进出忙”的上海港。为了支援亚非拉人民反帝斗争，他带领着全组工人在忘我地装运货物。“为革命，那怕山高海阔来阻挡，定要把深情厚谊，送往那四面八方！”这个胸襟开阔的英雄形象一开始就给观众留下了深刻的印象。
    “突击抢运到江岸，外轮启航要提前，乌云翻卷天色变，雷雨就要袭港湾。大米装船要赶点，小麦进仓要快搬”——在这样一个紧急的抢运抢搬、支援亚非拉人民的任务面前，高志扬自告奋勇地挑起了重担。当装卸队长赵震山担心完不成任务并且提出机械不够用的时候，高志扬和他的小组立即把全部机械让给人家。他们用自己的肩膀把场地上两千包小麦，一包包地扛进了码头仓库。高志扬十分豪爽地说：“为了支援世界革命，那怕是上刀山，下火海，咱们工人阶级决不推辞！扛他几包，又算什么？”
    在这里，我们不仅看到了高志扬见困难就上、见方便就让的崇高品质，而且看到了中国工人阶级那种全心全意为世界革命服务的国际主义精神！
    抢运刚完，高志扬忽然发现“有人散了包”。一种对世界革命人民极端负责的精神，使他抑制不住内心的激动：“一见小麦地上散，又急又气心不安，出国任务高标准，怎容散包混过关？”与此同时，满脑子资产阶级思想的仓库管理员钱守维却幸灾乐祸，说什么靠工人管不好码头。高志扬一听这话，一股强烈的无产阶级感情冲上胸口，他表示：“查不出，那散包，对不起阶级对不起党，那怕是针落海底，我也要倒海翻江！”
    这个小小的散包，在有些人看来，也许觉得不过是一件小事，但在高志扬看来却是重如泰山。他以当家作主的责任感，自觉地意识到：“援外任务应从严，政治影响大如天！”因而抛开了孩子生病等他回家送医院的私事，在党支部的领导和支持下，连夜发动工人进行翻仓，决心查出散包，消灭事故。
    谁知查出事故的时候，那个散包小麦已错当大米装上了驳船，而驳船又驶出了黄浦江。这时，海关钟敲打三响，再过两个多钟头，装上这批大米的外轮就要远航非洲了。高志扬心急如火燎，在这分秒逼人的时刻，他想到的是：“那驳船满载着祖国荣誉，决不能让散包撒上灰尘”。“那驳船装的是革命情谊，怎能够让散包留下污痕！”出自对祖国荣誉和国际义务的高度负责精神，在巨雷闪电倾盆大雨的黑夜，高志扬挺身而出，任凭“惊涛骇浪扑胸上，狂风暴雨抽脊梁”，飞驾汽艇，终于赶上驳船，调回散包，消灭了事故。
    高志扬靠着伟大的毛泽东思想，战胜了一个又一个的困难。他这种“明知惊涛骇浪险，偏向风波江上行”的英雄性格，是他对祖国社会主义事业和支援世界革命无限忠诚的表现。这个形象正是今天用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国工人，完全彻底地为全中国人民服务、为全世界人民服务的真实写照；也是我国亿万人民活学活用“老三篇”，树立“毫不利己专门利人”的革命世界观的生动概括。
    《海港》用京剧形式这样集中概括地反映出我国六十年代工人的精神面貌，塑造出这样血肉饱满的英雄工人形象，是一个可喜的收获。
