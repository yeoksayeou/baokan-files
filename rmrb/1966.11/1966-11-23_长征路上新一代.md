    Beat the war drums loudly, let them thunder!
    Red flags fly high, covering the sky!
    Red Guards fear no hardships on their long march,
    Crossing mountains and rivers, braving storms and thunder!

    The path is clear, the direction is right,
    The "Quotations from Chairman Mao" shine brightly!
    With hearts aflame and spirits unyielding, we make revolution,
    Fearless of knife mountains and fire seas!

    What of the vast deserts, the dense forests,
    What of the surging rivers, the towering mountains?
    The revolutionary Long March path, we shall walk,
    The hardships of revolution, we shall taste!

    Bring back revolutionary experience,
    Sow the seeds of revolution,
    The red land will be even more beautiful!
    Get to know the masses, get to know society,
    Get to know class struggle,
    In the storms, forge a new generation of revolutionaries!

    Beat the war drums loudly, let them thunder!
    Red flags fly high, covering the sky!
    To carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end,
    In the great storms, forge a new generation of revolutionaries!

    长征路上新一代
    姚成友战鼓呵，使劲擂，红旗呵，漫天飞；红卫兵不怕远征难，跋山涉水踏风雷！一条大路方向明，《毛主席语录》放光辉！心红志壮闹革命，刀山火海不皱眉！说什么戈壁遥遥，丛林莽
  莽，说什么江河滔滔，高山巍
  巍；革命的长征路，咱要亲自
  走，革命的风霜苦，咱要尝尝
  味！取回革命经，播下革命种，红色江山更壮美；熟悉群众，熟悉社会，熟悉
  阶级斗争，风浪中锻炼革命新一代！战鼓呵，使劲擂，红旗呵，漫天飞；为把无产阶级文化大革命进
  行到底，在大风大浪中锻炼革命新一
  代！
