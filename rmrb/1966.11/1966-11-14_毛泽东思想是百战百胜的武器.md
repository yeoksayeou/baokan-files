Mao Zedong Thought is an Invincible Weapon

In 1958, we, together with our sister ships, sank the U.S.-made Kuomintang warship "Tujian." Last year, during the Chongwu Sea Battle, we, along with our sister ships, sank the U.S.-made Kuomintang large gunboat "Yongchang" and severely damaged the "Yongtai."

How did our small gunboats manage to defeat the enemy's large warships? It was through Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary spirit of those armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The technical strength of warships can be calculated with numbers, but the power of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought is immeasurable.

When it comes to naval battles, some people think that whoever has the larger, faster, and more powerful warships will have the stronger combat effectiveness and will win. Our practice has proven that this understanding is wrong. No matter how complex the naval technology or how modern the equipment, combat effectiveness is always a unity of people and equipment, with the human factor being the decisive one. In naval combat, people use ships to defeat the enemy, but ships rely on people to be operated and used. Ships are inanimate, while people are alive. No matter how good the ships are, if there are no awakened people to operate them, they cannot exert their full power. The technical power of ships is limited and can be calculated with numbers, but the immense power generated by people armed with Mao Zedong Thought is immeasurable. With this power, weapons with only a fraction of their potential can be made to exert several times or even hundreds of times their effectiveness. With this power, one can move mountains and seas, create miracles, and defeat any powerful enemy.

Last year, during the Chongwu Sea Battle, the enemy, relying on their technological superiority, first bombarded us with concentrated fire. The sea was ablaze with light, and shells whistled overhead. Our soldiers paid no heed to this and bravely charged, closing in on the enemy ships and firing directly at them with our cannons, making the enemy unable to lift their heads. After the Chongwu Sea Battle, a prisoner, while examining the cannons and shells on our deck, kept glancing into the cabin, his face showing fear, surprise, and confusion, wondering if there were any "new weapons" in our cabin. Our sailors told him: "We have the best weapon, it is not a gun, not a cannon, but it is more powerful than guns, cannons, airplanes, tanks, and atomic bombs. It is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, it is the class consciousness and brave spirit of people."

Where does the soldiers' consciousness and bravery come from? Are they born with it? No, it is the result of being nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary practice tells us: without understanding class and class struggle, one does not understand revolution; without a class struggle perspective, one will not have true great wisdom and courage. We take Mao Zedong's teachings on class and class struggle as the foundation of our ideological construction, studying and applying them repeatedly. We deepen the soldiers' hatred for imperialism and the exploiting classes and strengthen their resolve to dedicate themselves to the revolutionary struggle.

Most of the soldiers on our ship are children of poor peasants who have suffered under the exploiting classes and reactionaries in the old society. Through studying Mao Zedong's works, they connect their painful family histories with the class sufferings of millions of laboring people, thus generating a revolutionary spirit to fight for the complete liberation of mankind. Fighting involves sacrifice, but the soldiers understand: dying for the revolution is a worthy death, heavier than Mount Tai. They say: "Life and death are both opposites and a unity; without death, there is no life. Without the sacrifices of the martyrs, there would be no happy life for the people today, nor would there be a happy future for generations to come." We do not advocate meaningless sacrifices, but when the country and the people need us, we must be ready to give our lives without hesitation.

Mao Zedong said: "A change in worldview is a fundamental change." Establishing a communist worldview is a process of repeated struggle to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Our ship has had this tradition for many years: when new comrades first come aboard, we do not give them guns or cannons, but "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The first lesson is not "Ship Performance," but "Serve the People." In daily life, we require soldiers to consciously use the "Three Articles" as weapons to carry out the struggle to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. In battle, we require soldiers to consciously bring the spirit of the "Three Articles" into their brave fighting. A large number of facts have proven: the more thoroughly one eliminates selfishness and the more firmly one establishes public-mindedness, the braver, smarter, and more complete and thorough one can serve the people.

Bravery comes from selflessness and great Mao Zedong Thought. Only by establishing a worldview of living for the revolution and dying for the revolution can one, in battle, most consciously put the annihilation of the enemy first and the preservation of oneself second; truly understand that only by annihilating a large number of enemies can one most effectively preserve oneself; and only by not fearing sacrifice can one reduce sacrifice. The braver we are, the calmer and more clever we fight; the braver we are, the more afraid the enemy becomes, and their technology is less effective; the braver we are, the faster we annihilate the enemy, and the more we can preserve ourselves. In the process of engaging the enemy in the Chongwu Sea Battle, the enemy frantically fired cannons, trying to intercept us with a dense net of fire. However, one of our sister ships skillfully avoided the enemy's fire and, like an arrow, charged straight to the enemy's nose, giving it a few heavy blows, instantly stunning the enemy and suppressing their firepower, creating favorable conditions for our continued attack, while our sister ship suffered no casualties. This powerfully demonstrates: bravely annihilating the enemy is the most effective way to preserve oneself. With our bravery, there is no enemy's tenacity. No matter how tenacious the enemy is, they cannot withstand the relentless blows of our fearless soldiers who are filled with hatred for the enemy.

Those who study Mao Zedong's works the best have the greatest bravery, the hardest bones, and the richest wisdom.

Revolutionary soldiers' fearlessness in battle is a concentrated expression of their fearlessness and endurance in peacetime. Only by enduring hardships and difficulties in peacetime can one bravely take the lead and charge into battle.

The operating environment of the navy is the vast ocean. In addition to fighting class enemies, we often fight against natural enemies. Sailing in high winds and waves, many people get seasick and vomit; while vomiting, they still insist on operating. In winter, the wind and rain on the sea are like knives cutting into the face; in summer, the deck is scorching hot, and the cabin is stuffy and hot. Faced with such hardships, we educate soldiers to face difficulties head-on and regard hard conditions as a great classroom for tempering revolutionary spirit. Strong revolutionary soldiers are forged and grown in hardships and storms. Signalman Ni Yongxiang often practices sending and receiving messages in the cramped signal room. In summer, the temperature in the signal room reaches over forty degrees, but he still insists on practicing. Some comrades advise him to rest or find a cooler place to practice. He responds firmly: "If you can't endure hardships in peacetime, you won't be able to stand firm in battle."

Why can our cadres and soldiers endure hardships and difficulties? Because everyone has studied Mao Zedong's works and has the foundation of serving the people wholeheartedly. Soldiers say: "We are enduring hardships for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We stand guard and patrol in the wind and rain for the happiness of the majority. In the past, revolutionary forerunners endured hardships and created New China; today, we endure hardships to create a new communist world." Signalman Yang Ruisong wrote in his notes on studying Mao Zedong's works: "Several nights of patrolling, only three hours of sleep each day. But I feel that we sleep less, so the people of the country can sleep more. Even if we don't sleep for more nights, I am willing."

A person who is willing to endure hardships for the revolution year after year and is willing to sacrifice for the revolution when needed is not something that can be achieved by a momentary impulse. Practice has proven that the better a soldier studies Mao Zedong's works, the fewer selfish thoughts they have, the more they can withstand hardships, and the braver they are in battle. Sailor Yang Jinxing has studied "Serve the People" more than thirty times since enlisting, improving each time. During the Chongwu Sea Battle, the roar of cannons made his ears ache, and the wet radio earpiece caused electric shocks, making his nerves ache, but he endured it all and excellently completed the task of receiving and sending signals. "Little Tiger" Ge Yi is also a soldier with a hard backbone, forged by studying Mao Zedong's works. After studying "Serve the People," he wrote the following oath: "For anything beneficial to the people, even if it means risking my life, I will do it; for anything harmful to the people, even if it means beheading me, I will not do it. In battle, if I am injured, as long as I have one arm and one leg, I will continue to fight. For anything beneficial to the battle, even if it means shedding the last drop of blood, I will complete it." A soldier with such high self-awareness to dedicate themselves to the Chinese people and the people of the world will have the greatest bravery, the hardest bones, and the richest wisdom.

We must have both the spirit of daring to struggle and the scientific attitude of being good at struggling.

Against the enemy's large warships, we must not only despise them and have the confidence to sink them but also take them seriously and be sure to annihilate them. We must have both the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win and the scientific attitude of being good at struggling and being good at winning.

Before we had the actual combat experience of sinking enemy warships, there were different opinions on whether small boats could sink large ships. Some new comrades thought: small boats can hardly sink large ships. Some old comrades thought: sinking enemy warships does not require much effort. Both of these views are one-sided. To guide everyone to form a comprehensive view, we brought the problem to Mao Zedong's works to find answers and discussed the topic "Can our small boats and cannons sink enemy ships?" letting comrades present difficulties, express opinions, and conduct specific analyses, and engaging in heated discussions.

Can our small boats and cannons sink enemy ships? Mao Zedong has long taught us: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created." We are revolutionary soldiers educated by Mao Zedong. Our technology and equipment may be temporarily inferior, but we have Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible treasure, and we will definitely create "miracles"!

Without the experience of predecessors to learn from, where do we get the methods? Mao Zedong teaches us that the people have limitless creativity. As long as we act according to Mao Zedong's instructions, three cobblers can top a Zhuge Liang, and how can we worry about not having methods? Mountains have paths, and deep waters have boats. Methods are always thought of by people!

The conclusion of the discussion is: small boats can completely defeat large ships, but they must have revolutionary spirit and a scientific attitude. Everyone said, sinking large ships with small boats, although there are some difficulties, Mao Zedong has long taught us that everything has two aspects. Difficulties also have two aspects. Difficulty and ease are relative and can be transformed under certain conditions. What is difficult is that it has not been practiced, and the laws of things have not been understood. Through practice, mastering its laws makes it no longer difficult. On the contrary, if difficulties are seen as absolute and unchanging, and one is afraid to struggle, then the laws of things will never be understood and mastered, and "difficulty" will always be difficult; what was not difficult will become difficult.

Under this guidance, everyone carefully studied and analyzed the various parts of the enemy ships and found that although the enemy ships have steel armor and iron hulls, they are not seamless and invincible. Mao Zedong teaches us that everything is interconnected and interdependent. The various parts of the enemy ships are also like this. Its relatively difficult-to-hit parts and easily-breachable parts are interrelated. If we avoid its strong points and attack its weak points, we make its originally weak points even weaker, and its originally difficult-to-hit parts will also become easy to hit. In the battle to sink the enemy's large gunboat "Tujian," we used the method of striking the enemy's weak points, making the strong weak. We first thoroughly destroyed and annihilated the enemy's deck targets, such as the command post, gun positions, and enemy personnel on the deck, quickly making the enemy's cannons "mute" and the armored plates "tofu tigers." This large ship was soon sunk.

Some people in the past regarded the caliber, number of cannons, and tonnage of ships as the entirety of combat effectiveness, believing that whoever had these conditions had the advantage. This is a metaphysical view. These people only saw the side of the enemy ships being large and having many personnel but did not see the side of the enemy's disunity and lack of fighting spirit, the more the worse. They only saw the side of the enemy ships having a large tonnage but did not see the side of our boats being small, having shallow drafts, and good maneuverability. They only calculated the number and design performance of the enemy's cannons but did not see that to exert the power of cannons, one must also rely on human action. Our soldiers said well: "Only with a red heart can the sights be accurate." From long-term combat against the enemy, we found a special "formula" for calculating the strength of ship firepower, which is: the sum of the design performance of all cannons multiplied by the combat will of the people operating and using the cannons. The higher the soldiers' fighting spirit is by one point, the ship's power increases by one fold. High morale is our army's unique absolute advantage, which the enemy cannot compare with.

In naval battles, we implemented the principle of "you fight with your firepower advantage, and I fight with my political advantage," using our fearless and unyielding characteristics to fight against the enemy's characteristics of greed for life and fear of death. In this way, not only do we fully exert our political advantage, but we also turn our shortcomings in weaponry into advantages; not only do we make the enemy's low morale even lower, but we also turn the enemy's advantages in weaponry into shortcomings.

Mao Zedong said: "The two opposing aspects within a thing, due to certain conditions, transform into each other and into their opposite positions." Generally speaking, enemy ships are large, and their firepower is relatively large; our boats are small, and their firepower is relatively small. However, in actual combat, this large and small is not absolute but is relative and can be transformed under certain conditions. The decisive condition for transformation is the spiritual state of people. During the Chongwu Sea Battle, when we were far from the enemy ships and our cannons did not pose a great threat to them, their cannons fired in an orderly and fierce manner; when we approached them and our cannons exerted their power, they became chaotic, and their cannons fired in a disorderly manner. In another naval battle, we found that one of the enemy's cannons was firing into the sky. Later, from a prisoner, we learned that the aimer of this cannon was the most afraid of death and did not dare to stick his head over the shield to find targets, resulting in his head getting lower and lower, and the cannon firing higher and higher. What use can such a person have, even with the best weapons?

You rely on your technological equipment to fight at a distance; I rely on my bravery and wisdom to fight at close range.

Through repeated actual combat training, our understanding of Mao Zedong's people's war thought has become deeper. We deeply feel that the deeper we understand and the better we implement the principle of "you fight with your advantages, and I fight with mine; if you can win, fight; if you can't win, retreat," and the more skillfully we use it, the more we can be invincible. The core idea of these four sentences is to avoid the enemy's strengths and strike their weaknesses, fully exerting our advantages and strengths. Naval combat, during the day, and at a distance, is most conducive to exerting the advantages of long-range weapons, which the enemy welcomes. Our army, based on its nature and characteristics, emphasizes close combat and night combat, so as to exert the advantages of our army and short-range weapons.

On this issue, we also went through a struggle. Some people thought that the navy could not fight close combat and night combat. They said: "The sea is boundless, with no terrain to utilize and no objects to hide behind; the enemy's cannons have a long range and strong firepower, and we cannot get close." Some people even cited foreign "experience" and regulations, saying that fighting close combat and night combat at sea involves great risks and has no precedent to follow. We brought this problem to the study of Mao Zedong's works. Mao Zedong said: all true knowledge comes from practice. Small boats sinking large ships is something that bourgeois military experts and revisionist military experts do not even dare to think about, so where would they have any experience? Following their regulations, victory would only be an empty word. We can only rely on Mao Zedong Thought and the wisdom of the masses to create our own experience. Fighting close combat and night combat at sea involves risks, but the soldiers said well: doing revolution cannot be afraid of taking risks, cannot be afraid of falling and not walking, cannot be afraid of taking a few cannonballs, and seeing the enemy's large ships would "give way." Everything in the world is done by people. As long as we have the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we can create experiences that are not in books and have not been seen in the world.

According to Mao Zedong's teachings, we specifically analyzed the situation of both sides and believed that close combat and night combat can be fought at sea. First, we have an absolute advantage in politics, with high morale, bravery, and tenacity, daring to fight and sacrifice, and having the spirit of self-sacrifice for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, which is the most fundamental condition. Second, although it is not easy to hide and approach the enemy at sea, our boats are small, and the enemy ships are large. We can discover the enemy first and suddenly and bravely launch an attack, taking the initiative and forcing the enemy's long-range weapons to lose their effectiveness. Third, the night, fog, reefs, and islands are our "green curtains" at sea, allowing us to hide and wait for opportunities to suddenly charge at the enemy. At this time, the enemy's large ships have high sides, and long-range weapons firing at close targets are like "swinging a hammer in a water jar," unable to exert their strength. In this way, the enemy's firepower advantage turns to its opposite.

Actual combat has proven that close combat and night combat are our army's unique traditional tactics and are also the basic tactics for small boats to fight large ships. In the Chongwu Sea Battle, as we approached the "Yongchang," the enemy panicked. Although their firepower was more intense, it was scattered without accuracy. After we opened fire, in a short time, we knocked it down, with people dead and cannons overturned. We deeply felt that close combat and night combat are like the Monkey King entering the Iron Fan Princess's belly. You want to hit me, but you can't; I want you to die, and you can't live.

In recent years, the victories we have achieved in escorting, protecting fisheries, and countering enemy sabotage activities are all victories of great Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's people's war thought. From the practice of war, we deeply feel: Mao Zedong Thought is our invincible weapon. With this weapon, our small boats can defeat the enemy's large ships and defeat any seemingly powerful enemy.

"The soldiers of the 'Sea Tiger Boat' are studying Comrade Lin Biao's 'Long Live the Victory of People's War.'"

    毛泽东思想是百战百胜的武器
    海军某部“海上猛虎艇”党支部
    一九五八年，我们同兄弟艇一起，打沉了美制蒋舰“沱江号”。去年，在崇武海战中，我们又和兄弟艇一道，击沉美制蒋帮大型炮舰“永昌号”，重创“永泰号”。
    我们的小炮艇是靠什么吃掉敌人大舰的呢？是靠毛泽东思想，靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的人的革命精神。
    兵舰的技术力量是可以用数字计算的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人的威力是无可估量的
      一提起海战，有些人就认为：谁的兵舰大、速度快、火力强，谁的战斗力就强，谁就能胜利。我们的实践证明，这种认识是错误的。无论海军的技术条件多么复杂，装备多么现代化，战斗力总是人和物的统一，而人的因素永远是决定因素。在海上作战，人要借助舰艇去战胜敌人，但舰艇是要依靠人去掌握和使用的。舰是死的，人是活的，再好的舰艇，如果没有觉悟的人去掌握，也发挥不出应有的威力。兵舰的技术威力是有限的，是可以用数字计算的，而用毛泽东思想武装起来的人所产生的强大力量，则是无可估量的。有了这种力量，就可以使只有十分威力的武器，发挥出几十分甚至几百分的作用。有了这种力量，就能排山倒海，创造人间奇迹，战胜任何强大的敌人。
      去年在崇武海战中，敌人借着技术装备的优势，首先以密集的炮火向我们轰击，海面上火光闪闪，炮弹在头顶上呼啸。我们的战士根本不顾这一套，硬是猛打猛冲，一直冲到敌舰跟前，用炮筒对准敌舰直接射击，打得敌人连头都抬不起来。崇武海战结束后，一个俘虏一面注意地端详着我艇甲板上的火炮和一堆堆的炮弹壳，一面又不时地瞅瞅舱里，脸上现出惶恐、惊奇、疑惑的神色，猜想我们的舱里是不是还有什么“新式武器”。我们的水兵告诉他：“我们有最好的武器，它不是枪，不是炮，但比枪炮、飞机、坦克、原子弹的威力都大得多，这就是用毛泽东思想武装的人，就是人的阶级觉悟，人的勇敢精神。”
    恨敌人，爱人民，破私立公，把献身于革命斗争的决心立得牢牢的
    战士的觉悟和勇敢精神从哪里来？是生来就有的吗？不，这是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的结果。革命斗争的实践告诉我们：不懂得阶级和阶级斗争，就不懂得革命；没有阶级斗争观点的糊涂人，就不会有真正的大智大勇。我们把活学活用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述当作思想建设的基础课，反复学，反复用。把干部战士对帝国主义和剥削阶级的仇恨搞得深深的，把献身于革命斗争的决心立得牢牢的。
    我们艇上的战士多数是贫下中农的子弟，在旧社会遭受过剥削阶级和反动派的迫害。通过学习毛主席著作，把自己惨痛的家史同千千万万劳动人民的阶级苦联系起来，这就产生了勇于为人类的彻底解放而献身的革命精神。打仗是会有牺牲的，但是战士们认识到：为革命而死，就是死得其所，重于泰山。他们说：“生和死，既是对立的，又是统一的；没有死，就没有生。没有先烈们的为革命而牺牲，就没有今天全国人民的幸福生活，也就没有将来子孙万代的幸福。”我们并不提倡无谓的牺牲，但是，当祖国人民需要的时候，我们又必须毫不犹豫地献出自己的生命。
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。而共产主义世界观的确立，又是一个破私立公的反复斗争过程。我们艇多年以来，就有这样一个传统，新同志一上艇，首先交给他们的不是枪、不是炮，而是《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》三篇文章。上的第一课不是“舰艇性能”，而是《为人民服务》。在平日，要求战士们自觉地以“老三篇”为武器，开展灭资兴无的斗争；在战时，要求战士们自觉地带着“老三篇”的思想去英勇战斗。大量事实雄辩地证明：谁的私有观念破得最彻底，谁的公有观念立得最牢固，谁就能够变得最勇敢，最聪明，为人民服务最“完全”，最“彻底”。
      勇敢来自无私，来自伟大的毛泽东思想。一个革命战士只有确立了生为革命生、死为革命死的世界观，在战斗中，才能最自觉地把消灭敌人摆在第一位，把保存自己放在第二位；才能真正理解：只有大量地消灭敌人，才能最有效地保存自己；只有不怕牺牲，才能减少牺牲。我们越勇敢，就越沉着机智，越打得聪明、漂亮；我们越勇敢，敌人就越害怕，他们的技术就越不易发挥作用；我们越勇敢，消灭敌人就越快，也就越能保存自己。在崇武海战的接敌过程中，敌人疯狂地打炮，妄图用密集的火网拦截我们，但是我们有一艘兄弟艇，巧妙地避开敌人的炮火，箭一样地一直冲到敌舰鼻子跟前，狠狠地给了它几炮，一下子就把敌人打昏了，把敌人的火力压下去了，给我们继续攻击创造了有利条件，而我们这艘兄弟艇却没有一点伤亡。这就有力地说明：勇敢地消灭敌人，就是有效地保存
  自己。有了我们的勇敢，就没有敌人的顽强。再顽强的敌人，也抵不住我们对敌人充满着刻骨仇恨的无畏战士的捶击。
    毛主席著作学得最好的人，具有最大的勇敢，最硬的骨头，最丰富的智慧
    革命战士战时不怕死，是平时不怕苦、不畏难的集中表现。平时敢于吃大苦、耐大劳，战时才勇于当尖刀、打头阵。
    海军的活动天地是辽阔的海洋。除了同阶级敌人进行斗争以外，还经常同自然界的敌人进行搏斗。在大风大浪中航行，很多人晕船、呕吐；一边吐，一边还要坚持操作。冬天，海上的风雨，像尖刀刺在脸上；夏天，甲板晒得发烫，舱房里又闷又热。在这样的艰苦生活面前，我们教育战士要知难而进，把艰苦的条件当作冶炼革命精神的大课堂。坚强的革命战士，就是要在艰苦困难、大风大浪中锻炼成长起来。报务兵倪永香，经常在狭窄的报房里练习收发报。夏天，报房的温度高达四十多度，但他还是坚持练习。有的同志劝他休息一下，或者找一个风凉的地方练。他回答得非常干脆：“平时吃不了苦，战时就过不得硬。”
    为什么我们的干部、战士能在艰苦困难的条件下，自觉地进行锻炼？这是因为大家学习了毛主席著作，有了全心全意为人民服务的思想基础。战士们说：“我们是为中国革命和世界革命去吃大苦、耐大劳的，我们在风雨里站岗巡逻，就是为了大多数人的幸福。过去，革命先辈吃苦，创造出了新中国；今天，我们吃苦，要创造出个共产主义新世界。”信号兵杨瑞松在学习毛主席著作的心得笔记上写道：“几天晚上都在巡逻，每天只能睡三个小时。但我觉得，我们少睡几个小时，祖国千千万万的人，就能多睡几个小时。哪怕更多的晚上不睡觉，我也心甘情愿。”
    一个人长年累月地乐于为革命吃苦，在革命需要的时候，又能勇于牺牲，这决不是凭一时的冲动能办到的。事实证明，哪个战士毛主席著作学得最好，哪个战士私心杂念就最少，就能经得起艰苦的考验，打起仗来就最勇敢。水兵杨进兴入伍以来，《为人民服务》学了三十多遍，学一次有一次的提高。崇武海战中，隆隆的炮声震得他两耳胀痛，无线电耳机受潮漏电，刺得他神经钻心痛，他都忍受住了，出色地完成了收发信号的任务。“小老虎”葛毅，也是靠学习毛主席著作成为硬骨头战士的。他学了《为人民服务》之后，写下了这样的誓言：“凡是对人民有利的事，哪怕豁上生命我也去干，凡是对人民不利的事，哪怕杀我的头我也不干。在战斗中，如果我受了伤，只要还有一条胳膊，一条腿，就要坚持战斗。只要对战斗有利的事，哪怕流尽最后一滴血，我也要去完成。”一个战士，有了这种勇于为中国人民和世界人民献身的高度自觉，就会有最大的勇敢，最硬的骨头，最丰富的智慧。
    既要有敢于斗争的革命精神，又要有善于斗争的科学态度
    对敌人的大型军舰，我们不仅要藐视它，有信心击沉它；还要重视它，做到有把握消灭它。既要具有敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命气概，又要具有善于斗争、善于胜利的科学态度。
    我们艇在没有打沉敌人大型军舰的实战经验以前，对小艇能不能打大舰，曾经有过不同的看法。有些新同志认为：小艇很难打大舰。一些老同志则认为：打敌人大军舰也无需费多大力气。这两种看法，都有片面性。为了引导大家得出全面的看法，我们就带着问题到毛主席著作中找答案；并且以“我们的小艇小炮，能不能击沉敌舰”为题，让同志们摆困难，谈看法，进行具体的分析，展开热烈的讨论。
    我们艇小炮小能不能打沉敌舰呢？毛主席早就教导我们：“在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”我们是毛主席教育出来的革命战士，技术装备暂时差点，可是，我们有毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的法宝，一定能够创造出“人间奇迹”！
      没有前人经验的借鉴，办法从哪里来呢？毛主席教导我们，人民群众有无限的创造力。只要我们按照毛主席的指示去办，三个臭皮匠，顶个诸葛亮，又何愁没有办法？山高有路走，水深有船行，办法总是人们想出来的！
      讨论的结论是：小艇完全能打败大舰，但必须具有革命气概和科学态度。大家说，小艇打大舰，虽然存在一些困难，但是毛主席早就教导我们，一切事物无不具有两重性，困难也有两重性。难和不难也是相对的，是能够在一定条件下相互转化的。所谓难，是指还没有实践，对事物的规律性还没有认识。通过实践，掌握了它的规律，也就变得不难了。反之，如果把困难看成绝对的、不变的，老虎屁股摸不得，不敢去斗争，那么事物的规律永远也不可能被认识和掌握，“难”永远是难；本来不难的，也会变得难起来。
    在这个思想指导下，大家对敌舰的各个部位作了仔细的研究分析，发现敌舰虽有钢甲铁壳，但也并不是天衣无缝，无懈可击。毛主席教导我们，一切事物都是互相联系、互相制约的。敌人军舰的各部位也是这样。它的比较难打的部位和容易攻破的部位相互关联着。如果我们避开它的强处，来攻打它的弱点，就使它原来弱的更弱了，原来比较难打的也会变成容易打的了。在打敌人大型炮舰“沱江号”的战斗中，我们就运用了向敌舰弱处开刀，逼强变弱的办法，先把敌舰的舱面目标，如指挥台、炮位和舱面上的敌人等，彻底摧毁和消灭掉，很快就使敌人火炮变成了“哑巴”，防弹钢板转化为“豆腐老虎”，这只大舰很快也就被击沉了。
    你打你的火力优势，我打我的政治优势
    过去，有些人把火炮口径、数目和船的吨位，看作是战斗力的全部，认为谁具备了这些条件，优势就掌握在谁的手里。这是形而上学的观点。这些人，只看见敌人军舰大、人员多的一面，没有看到敌人人心不齐，士无斗志，越多越乱的一面；只看见敌舰吨位大的一面，没有看见我们艇小，吃水浅，机动性能好的一面；只算了敌人火炮门数、设计性能的账，没有看到要发挥火炮的威力，还必须依靠人的作用。我们的战士说得好：“只有思想红，才能准星正。”我们从长期的对敌作战中，找到了计算舰艇火力强弱的特殊“公式”，这就是：各火炮设计性能的总和，乘以掌握和使用火炮的人的战斗意志。人的斗志高一分，舰艇的威力就长一倍。士气高昂，是我军独有的绝对优势，敌人根本无法同我们相比。
    在海战中，我们贯彻了你打你的火力优势、我打我的政治优势的原则，用我们勇敢不怕死的特长，去打敌人贪生怕死的特短。这样，不仅使我们的政治优势得到充分发挥，而且把我们在武器装备上的短处变成了长处；不仅使敌人低落的士气变得更加低落，而且把敌人在武器装备上的长处也变成短处。
    毛主席说：“事物内部矛盾着的两方面，因为一定的条件而各向着和自己相反的方面转化了去，向着它的对立方面所处的地位转化了去。”一般地说来，敌舰大，火力相对的大；我艇小，火力相对的小。但是在实战中，这种大和小不是绝对的，是在一定条件下相互转化的。转化的决定性条件就是人的精神状态。崇武海战中，当我们离敌舰远，火炮对他们威胁不大的时候，他们的火炮打得很有规律，也很疯狂；当我们一靠近它，我们的火炮一发挥威力的时候，他们就乱成一团，炮就打得很不像样子了。在另一次海战中，我们发现敌人有门炮一股劲儿往天上打。以后从俘虏口中才知道，这门炮的瞄准手最怕死，不敢把脑袋伸过护板找目标，结果头越缩越低，炮也就越打越高了。像这样的人，即便手中拿着最好的武器，又能起多大作用呢？
    你靠你的技术装备打远战
    我靠我的勇敢机智打近战
    通过一次又一次的实战锻炼，我们对毛主席人民战争思想的领会就越来越深刻。我们深深体会到，将“你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走”的原则领会得深，贯彻得好，运用得活，就能战无不胜。而这四句话的核心思想，就是避敌之长，击敌之短，充分发挥我之优势和长处。海上作战，白天，远战，最易于发挥远程火器的优势，这是敌人所欢迎的。我军根据自己的性质和特点，强调打近战、夜战，这样才能发挥我军的特长和近程火器的优势。
    在这个问题上，我们也经过了一番斗争。有些人认为海军不能打近战、夜战。他们说：“海上一望无边，没有地形可利用，没有地物可隐蔽；敌人火炮射程又远，火力又强，靠近不了。”有的人还搬出了外国人的“经验”、条条，说明海上打近战、夜战，要冒很大的风险，没有先例可循。我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：一切真知无不来源于实践。小艇打大舰，在资产阶级军事家、修正主义军事家那里，是连想都不敢想的事情，他们又哪里有什么经验呢？照他们的条条打，胜利当然只能是一句空话。我们只有靠毛泽东思想，靠群众的智慧，打出自己的经验来。海上打近战、夜战，是要冒风险，但是战士们说得好：干革命不能怕担风险，不能怕摔跤就不走路，不能怕挨几颗炮弹，见了敌人的大舰就“让路”。世界上的事都是人做出来的。只要有毛泽东思想的指导，我们就可以创造出书本上找不到的、世界上还没有的经验来。
    我们按照毛主席的教导，具体分析了敌我双方的情况，认为在海上完全可以打近战、夜战。首先，我们在政治上占绝对优势，士气旺盛，英勇顽强，敢打敢拚，有勇于为中国革命和世界革命献身的自我牺牲精神，这是最根本的条件。其次，海上虽说不易隐蔽接敌，但我艇小，敌舰大，我们可以先敌发现，突然勇猛地向敌人发起冲击，先发制人，迫使敌人的远程火器失去应有的效力。再次，夜幕、雾海、礁石、岛屿，都是我们隐蔽待机的海上“青纱帐”，可以出敌不意地冲到敌人跟前。这时，敌舰大舷高，远程火器打近目标，就像“水缸里耍锤”，有劲使不上。这样，敌人依靠的火力优势就向着它的反面转化了。
    实战证明，近战、夜战是我军独有的传统战法，也是小艇打大舰的基本战法。在崇武海战中，我们向
  “永昌号”一逼近，敌人就发了慌。他们的炮火虽然打得更急，可是东一发，西一发，根本没有准头。等我们开了炮，不一会，就将它打得人死炮翻。我们深深体会到，近战、夜战，就像孙悟空钻进铁扇公主的肚子里，你想打我，打不着，我要你死，你就活不成。
    几年来，我们艇在护航、护渔和反击敌人破坏活动中所取得的胜利，都是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，毛主席人民战争思想的胜利。从战争的实践中，我们深切体会到：毛泽东思想是我们百战百胜的武器。有了这个武器，我们的小艇就能吃掉敌人的大舰，就能打败任何貌似强大的敌人。（附图片）
