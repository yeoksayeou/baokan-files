Japanese youth recently staged a play about Comrade Ou Yanghai, a good fighter of Chairman Mao, which was enthusiastically supported and praised by Japanese friends.

The play was adapted from the seventh chapter, "Journey Home," of the famous Chinese novel "The Song of Ou Yanghai" by second-year students in the Chinese Department of the Tokyo Asia-Africa Language Institute. They performed the play in Chinese.

The students who led the adaptation and performance of the play said: We staged "The Song of Ou Yanghai" to better understand the significance of the great proletarian cultural revolution in China. At the same time, it is also to promote friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

Most of the actors in the performance are part-time students. The actor who played Ou Yanghai studies during the day and works in a store at night. He is determined to portray this great fighter's image well, and every night after work, he goes home and practices the lines in the play while lying in bed.

The hardships endured by Ou Yanghai's family in old Chinese society and Ou Yanghai's growth under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought deeply moved the actors who participated in the performance.

On the 5th, when they first performed the play at their school, many Japanese friends came to watch and encouraged them.

After the performance, a discussion was held, during which the actors and audience shared their experiences and feelings about the performance and viewing. Everyone ended by singing together the song praising the great leader Chairman Mao, "The East Is Red."

    更好地宣传中国文化大革命的意义
    日本青年演出中文话剧《欧阳海之歌》
    新华社东京电　日本青年最近演出描写毛主席的好战士欧阳海的话剧，受到日本朋友的热情支持和赞扬。
    这个话剧是由东京亚非语学院中文系二年级学生，根据中国著名长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》第七章《家乡行》改编，并由他们用中国话演出的。
    领导改编、演出这个话剧的学生说：我们演出《欧阳海之歌》是为了更好地理解中国伟大的无产阶级文化革命的意义，同时，也是为了增进日中两国人民的友好。
    参加演出的多数演员是半工半读的学生。扮演欧阳海的演员，白天在学校念书，晚上在一家商店里劳动。他一心一意地想把这个伟大战士的形象演好，每天晚上劳动后回到家里躺在床上，还练习剧中的台词。
    欧阳海全家在中国旧社会的痛苦遭遇和欧阳海在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的过程，使参加演出的演员们深受感动。
    五日，当他们在学校里首次演出这个话剧时，不少日本朋友前来观看，给他们以鼓励。
    演出结束后，还举行了座谈会，演员和观众畅谈演出和观看的体会，大家最后一起高唱歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲《东方红》。
