Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's various communes have taken "the Three Articles" as their spiritual weapons, launching a high tide of autumn afforestation.

Many places in Ningxia are deserts, making it difficult to grow trees. This time, everyone studied "the Three Articles," gaining enthusiasm, wisdom, and methods, and also gained confidence in afforesting the desert.

Workers at the Zhongwei County Sand Control Forest Farm fought for four days to transport two million jin of wheat straw into the desert, set up straw barriers, and established nurseries in the desert, cultivating tree saplings over sixty mu.

The southern mountainous regions of Ningxia also broke the old habit of not afforesting in the autumn, combining water and soil conservation, and launched afforestation activities.

    宁夏开展造林活动
    宁夏回族自治区各地社员以“老三篇”为精神武器，掀起秋季造林高潮。
    宁夏不少地区是沙漠，种树很难种活。这次，大家学习“老三篇”学出了干劲、智慧和办法，对沙漠造林也有了信心。
    中卫县固沙林场的职工为了育苗，奋战四天，把二百万斤麦草运进沙漠，扎设草障，在沙漠中开辟苗圃，育树苗六十多亩。
    宁夏南部山区也打破往年秋季不造林的旧习，结合水土保持，开展了植树造林活动。
