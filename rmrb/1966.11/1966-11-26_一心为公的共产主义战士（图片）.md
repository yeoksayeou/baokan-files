A selfless communist warrior

Cai Yongxiang, a soldier of the great era of Mao Zedong, is another hero like Ou Yanghai. He sacrificed his life to protect the Qiantang River Bridge and the Red Guards. Cai Yongxiang was only 18 years old. His short life was brilliant and radiant. He is a selfless communist warrior worthy of our eternal learning.

Cai Yongxiang is from Feidong County, Anhui Province. He comes from a poor peasant family. His father worked as a cowherd and laborer for the landlord since he was young. His mother begged for food, worked as a servant for the landlord, and toiled for the capitalist for over a decade, enduring endless exploitation and oppression. Only after liberation did they turn their lives around. His mother often told him stories of their hardships in the old society, saying, "Yongxiang, remember the sweetness of today and the bitterness of the past. Always listen to Chairman Mao and follow Chairman Mao."

He loved Chairman Mao since he was young. In primary school, his favorite song was "The East is Red," and his favorite lesson was also "The East is Red." He found a Chairman Mao badge to wear on his chest and a portrait of Chairman Mao to stick in his notebook, saying happily, "Now I can see Chairman Mao every day!"

After watching the movie "Lei Feng," Cai Yongxiang decided to "learn from Lei Feng and be like Lei Feng." He loved the people's commune and cared for the collective. When a typhoon struck, he rushed to save the rice in the production team's drying ground instead of his own home. When a fire broke out in the production team's straw pile, he climbed onto the pile to extinguish the flames. His clothes were burned, and his hands blistered, but for the collective, he paid no heed to his own sufferings.

On February 8, 1966, Cai Yongxiang joined the People's Liberation Army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Upon entering the barracks, he did not rush to settle his bed or drink hot water but focused on the Mao Zedong quotations posted on the bedhead and walls. He decided to be like the old comrades, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to become a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Cai Yongxiang had an unlimited love for Chairman Mao's works. Soon after joining the new recruits, before receiving the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he borrowed a copy and copied the quotations into his own notebook. He said, "Without eyes, one cannot tell east from west. Without studying Chairman Mao's works, one will lose direction."

The first time he received his allowance, Cai Yongxiang bought three copies of the selected readings of Chairman Mao's works, giving two away and keeping one for himself. He studied diligently and applied his knowledge with great determination. He said, "One can go a day without eating, but one cannot go a day without studying Chairman Mao's works."

Soon after enlisting, the company launched a socialist education campaign. During the campaign, he recalled his family history and denounced the evil old society. In the dining hall, there were posters of class education. He would go to see them before and after meals. When asked why he kept looking at them, he said, "The class bitterness and blood debt in the pictures must be seen and remembered every day. The more I see, the more I love Chairman Mao and the more I want to read Chairman Mao's books."

Cai Yongxiang read the "Three Constantly Read Articles" the most. Although his cultural level was low and he faced difficulties in studying, he had a strong will and revolutionary spirit to overcome all obstacles and strive for victory. For words he didn't recognize, he would draw marks next to them and write phonetic equivalents; for words he didn't understand, he would ask others repeatedly. He said, "I have made up my mind to read Chairman Mao's books for life and follow Chairman Mao in the revolution for life!"

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, Cai Yongxiang grew rapidly. He decided to follow the example of Zhang Zedong, serving the people wholeheartedly, and "be a Zhang Zedong guarding the bridge." One night, during a heavy rainstorm, he stood guard by the river, enduring the rain rather than taking a few steps to the sentry box for shelter. He said, "Clothes can be dried, but if the bridge is damaged, what a great loss it would be to the people!"

Cai Yongxiang followed the example of Zhang Zedong, putting the collective and others before himself. He often said, "For the revolution, the more effort I put in, the more comfortable I feel; for the people, the more I do, the happier I am." His comrades said, "Cai Yongxiang's mind is filled with revolution and others, but there is no room for himself."

He was always ready to do good deeds for the people, wherever he went. Once, his foot was pierced by a nail, and on his way back from the hospital, he saw an old woman who had forgotten her money and couldn't buy a ticket. He gave her the two yuan he had, enduring the pain to walk back to the company, covering a distance of over ten li.

On the path of revolution, Cai Yongxiang strictly required himself, taking the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as his motto, breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," never allowing the "public" and "self" to sit on the same bench. One noon, after several nights of night training, he was very tired and was taking a nap. Suddenly, he heard the pigs in the kitchen crying because they hadn't been fed. He hesitated for a moment, thinking, "Not taking action when seeing something is this responsible for the work?" He immediately got out of bed to feed the pigs.

One Sunday, Cai Yongxiang asked for leave to go out and buy soap. On his way back, he saw some workers carrying coal and immediately helped them. The more he carried, the more energetic he became, forgetting to return on time. When he returned, the platoon leader criticized him for being late. He didn't want to tell the platoon leader about the good deed he had done, but he felt a bit wronged. He repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," resolving his inner conflicts.

Later, the platoon leader found out why Cai Yongxiang was late and praised him in the platoon meeting, also criticizing himself. Cai Yongxiang sincerely said, "Platoon leader, you are not criticizing me for doing good deeds but for being late. You are right!" In this small matter and a few short words, the sparks of communist thought shone brightly. He was like this, turning the "Three Constantly Read Articles" into his soul and a sharp weapon for breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public."

"Standing on the bridge, thinking of the world." The "Three Constantly Read Articles" made Cai Yongxiang's mind filled with a great "public" spirit. This "public" spirit was "big enough to hold the world!" Once, he and Xia Yingmin stood side by side on the Qiantang River Bridge, saying, "This bridge leads to Beijing and Vietnam. Chairman Mao tells us to guard this bridge, which means guarding the proletarian state and supporting the world revolution." He always thought about the party's affairs, the country's affairs, and the world's affairs.

Cai Yongxiang was determined to contribute everything he had to the just struggle of the world's people. Therefore, he studied Chairman Mao's works more diligently to raise his proletarian consciousness and trained harder in throwing grenades and bayonet combat to master the skills of killing the enemy. He repeatedly requested permission from his superiors to go to Vietnam to fight against the Americans. He said, "If permitted, I will fiercely attack the enemy; if not permitted, I will vigilantly guard the bridge."

"I will dedicate my youth to the bridge." Cai Yongxiang always had the enemy in mind. One night, after returning from guard duty, he took off his clothes to sleep but heard some noise near a pier. The platoon leader led a search team, and he, without even putting on his clothes, grabbed his gun and ran to the front of the search team, bravely rushing towards the pier through the reeds. He valued the bridge more than his own life.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, Cai Yongxiang, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, actively and bravely defended Mao Zedong Thought. He treated the company's wall newspaper as a battlefield for defending Mao Zedong Thought. After watching the movie "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles," he wrote an article criticizing it in anger. After watching other works that went against Mao Zedong Thought, he also conducted criticism. Comrades said, "Cai Yongxiang is a pioneer in criticizing the old world."

While actively criticizing the bourgeoisie, Cai Yongxiang vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought. He often organized and performed cultural activities, singing praises to the great party, the great leader Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. He composed a song:

Stars in the sky, shining bright,
I stand on the bridge, looking towards Beijing.
Seeing Tiananmen in Beijing,
Chairman Mao is our great savior.

Cai Yongxiang had an unlimited love for Chairman Mao and was unyieldingly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Five days before his martyrdom, on October 5, he used his nap time to specially request leave to go into the city and buy three portraits of Chairman Mao with a radiant face, posting them on the wall of the platoon. He told his comrades, "This is the best gift I can give the platoon for National Day, so that comrades can see Chairman Mao every day and always remember Chairman Mao's teachings."

At 2:34 AM on October 10, Cai Yongxiang, as usual, stood guard vigilantly. At that time, a special train for the Red Guards was rushing towards the bridge from the Nanchang direction. Suddenly, he discovered a large piece of wood lying across the tracks about 40 meters away from the guard post. This was the enemy's sabotage. In the moment before a serious accident, he reported to the railway patrolman while rushing towards the train.

The young Red Guards in the carriages were either studying Chairman Mao's quotations or sharing experiences of the revolutionary journey. They loved Chairman Mao deeply and wished to fly to his side to receive his inspection!

"Even if the sky falls, I dare to go up!" At this critical moment, Cai Yongxiang rushed towards the obstacle 40 meters away without hesitation! Every step of these 40 meters showed the great power of Mao Zedong Thought! Every step shone with the brilliant light of selfless communist thought! Finally, the obstacle was removed, the Red Guards were saved, and the Qiantang River Bridge was protected. The young Cai Yongxiang, however, sacrificed his brilliant life.

Cai Yongxiang's young life shone with an unquenchable light. His death was heavier than Mount Tai. Tens of thousands of young Red Guards, with deep respect, came from all over the country to the Qiantang River Bridge to learn from and pay tribute to the selfless communist warrior and loyal defender of the proletarian cultural revolution, Cai Yongxiang.

Cai Yongxiang's heroic image will forever live in our hearts. We must be like Cai Yongxiang, forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought; like Cai Yongxiang, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, establish a selfless communist spirit; like Cai Yongxiang, maintain high revolutionary vigilance, defend the proletarian cultural revolution, strengthen war preparedness, and prevent sudden attacks by American imperialism and its lackeys.

    一心为公的共产主义战士
    浙江军区政治部供稿
    ①　蔡永祥同志是伟大毛泽东时代的又一个欧阳海式的英雄，他用自己的鲜血和生命，保卫了钱塘江大桥，保卫了红卫兵。蔡永祥同志今年刚满十八岁，他短短的一生，是光辉灿烂的一生。他是值得我们永远学习的一心为公的共产主义战士。
    ②　蔡永祥同志是安徽省肥东县人。出身贫农。父亲从小给地主放牛，帮工；母亲讨过饭，给地主当过佣人，给资本家作过十几年工，受尽了剥削和压迫，解放后才翻了身。母亲常讲旧社会的辛酸家史给他听，她说：“永祥啊，今天的甜要记在心，过去的苦要记在心，要永远听毛主席的话，永远跟毛主席走。”
    ③　他从小热爱毛主席。在小学读书时，最爱唱的歌是《东方红》，最爱读的一课是《东方红》。他想方设法找到了一枚毛主席像章挂在胸前，还找到了一幅毛主席像贴在自己的本子上，高兴地说：“我可以天天看到毛主席了！”
    ④　蔡永祥同志看了《雷锋》电影后，决心“学雷锋，做雷锋”。他热爱人民公社，处处关心集体。当台风袭来的时候，他抢救的不是自己家的房子，而是生产队晒谷场上的稻谷。生产队的大稻草堆起了火，他便爬上草堆扑打烈火。衣服烧坏了，手被烧得起了泡，但是为了集体，他对自己的一切都无暇顾及。
    ⑤　一九六六年二月八日，蔡永祥跨进了人民解放军这所毛泽东思想的大学校。他来到宿舍，不忙着去安顿铺位，也顾不得喝一口热水，却全神贯注地看床头上和墙壁上张贴的一张张毛主席语录。他决心像老同志那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    ⑥　蔡永祥同志无限热爱毛主席著作。他刚到新兵连，还没有发《毛主席语录》，他就借来一本，一条条抄到自己的本子上。他说：“人没有眼睛就不知东南西北，不学毛主席著作就会迷失方向。”
    ⑦　第一次发津贴费，蔡永祥同志就买了三本毛主席著作选读本，两本送给别人，一本留给自己。他学得勤，用得狠，表现了惊人的毅力。他说：“一天不吃饭可以，一天不学毛主席著作万万不行。”
    ⑧　蔡永祥同志入伍不久，连队里开展了社会主义教育运动，他在运动中回忆了自己的家史，控诉了万恶的旧社会。饭堂里贴着一套阶级教育展览图片，他饭前饭后总要去看一遍。别人问他为什么老看不够？他说：“图片上的阶级苦，血泪仇，要天天看，天天想，我越看越想，越热爱毛主席，越爱读毛主席的书。”
    ⑨　蔡永祥同志读得最多的是“老三篇”。他虽然文化水平低，学习有困难，但是，他有一股硬劲，有着排除万难、争取胜利的革命精神。有许多字不认识，他就在旁边画记号，注同音字；有的词不懂，就一次次请教别人。他说：“我下定决心，读一辈子毛主席的书，跟毛主席闹一辈子革命！”
    ⑩　在毛泽东思想的哺育下，蔡永祥同志迅速地成长起来。他决心以张思德为榜样，全心全意为人民服务，“做一个守卫大桥的张思德”。一天夜晚下起瓢泼大雨，他在江边执勤，宁叫大雨淋着，也不跨几步到哨所里避雨。他说：“衣服湿了可以晒干，如果大桥遭到破坏，那对人民是多大的损失啊！”
    ?　蔡永祥同志以张思德为榜样，一心为公，一心为人民，关心同志、关心集体比关心自己为重。他常说：“为革命多出一点力，我感到舒服；为人民多做一件事，我感到幸福。”战友们说：“蔡永祥同志的头脑里，只有革命，只有他人，就是没有自己。”
    ?　他热心地为人民做好事，走到哪里做到哪里。一次，他的脚被钉头戳破了，从医院回来，在湖滨车站候车。他看到一位老大娘忘记带钱没法买票，就把身上仅有的两角钱给老大娘买了车票，自己却忍住伤痛，步行十几里，回到连队。
    ?　蔡永祥同志在革命化的道路上，严格要求自己，以“老三篇”为座右铭，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，决不让“公”字和“私”字坐在一条板凳上。一天中午，因连续几夜搞夜间训练，很疲劳，正在睡午觉，忽然听到伙房的猪因为没有喂叫了起来。他犹豫了一阵，一想：“见事不管，这是对工作极端负责任吗？”马上翻身下床去喂猪了。
    ?　一个星期天，蔡永祥请假外出买肥皂。在回来的路上，看到一些工人在挑煤，他马上帮助挑起来，越挑越有劲，竟忘了按时回连。回来后，班长批评他不该误假，他不愿把做的好事告诉班长，可是心里又有点委屈。他反复学习《为人民服务》，解开了思想疙瘩。
    ?　事后，班长知道了蔡永祥误假的原因，就在班务会上表扬了他，并作了自我批评。蔡永祥赤诚地说：“班长，你不是批评我做好事，是批评我误假，你批评得对啊！”小小一件事，短短几句话，闪烁着共产主义思想的火花。他就是这样，把“老三篇”化为自己的灵魂，作为破私立公的锐利武器。
    ?　“站在大桥上，心怀全世界。”“老三篇”使蔡永祥脑子里树立了一个很大的“公”字，这个“公”字，“大得能装进一个世界！”有一次，他和夏英敏同志并肩走上钱塘江大桥，他说：“这座桥通往北京，通往越南。毛主席叫咱保卫这座桥，就是叫咱保卫祖国的无产阶级江山，就是支援世界革命。”他想的总是党的大事，国家的大事，世界的大事。
    ?　蔡永祥决心为世界人民的正义斗争贡献出自己的一切。因此，他更加勤奋地学习毛主席著作，提高无产阶级觉悟；更加刻苦地练投弹，练刺杀，掌握杀敌本领。他多次要求上级批准他援越抗美。他说：“如果批准了，我要狠狠地打击敌人；如果不批准，我就百倍警惕地守卫好大桥。”
    ?　“我要把青春献给大桥。”蔡永祥同志的脑子里时刻有敌情观念。一天夜里，他刚执勤回来，脱下衣服准备睡觉，听说一座桥墩旁边有动静。班长带人去搜索，他连衣服也顾不上穿，一翻身拿起枪，跑在搜索部队的前面，穿过芦苇，勇敢地奔向桥墩。他把大桥看得比自己的生命还重。
    ?　在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的蔡永祥，自觉地、勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想。他把连里的墙报当作捍卫毛泽东思想的阵地。他看了电影《逆风千里》以后，愤怒地写文章批判。看了其它违背毛泽东思想的作品，都要进行批判。同志们说：“蔡永祥是批判旧世界的闯将。”
    ?　蔡永祥在积极批判资产阶级的同时，大力宣传毛泽东思想。他经常编演文娱节目，歌颂伟大的党，歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他编了这样一首歌：
    天上星，亮晶晶，我在大桥望北京。
    望到北京天安门，毛主席是我们的大救星。
    ?　蔡永祥同志无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想。他在牺牲的前五天——十月五日，利用午睡时间，专门请假进城买了三张红光满面的毛主席画像，张贴在班里的墙上。他对同志们说：“这是国庆节我送给班里最好的礼物，好让同志们天天见到毛主席，时刻想着毛主席的教导。”
    ?　十月十日凌晨二时三十四分，蔡永祥和往常一样，警惕地在哨位上执勤。这时从南昌方向开来一列红卫兵专车，向大桥飞驰而来。突然，他发现离哨位四十多米的轨道上横着一根大木头。这是阶级敌人的破坏活动。一场严重事故就要发生的瞬间，他一面向铁路巡道工报警，一面奋不顾身地向列车迎头奔去。
    ?　车厢里的红卫兵小将们，这时有的在学习毛主席语录，有的在交谈革命大串连的经验。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱，多么想一下子飞到毛主席的身边，接受毛主席的检阅啊！
    ?　“天塌地裂也敢上！”在这危急万分的时刻，蔡永祥奋不顾身地向着距离四十多米的障碍物冲上去！这四十多米，每一步都显示着毛泽东思想的巨大威力！每一步都闪烁着一心为公的共产主义思想的光辉！终于，障碍排除了，红卫兵脱险了，钱塘江大桥保住了，年青的蔡永祥同志，却献出了光辉的生命。
    ?　蔡永祥同志年轻的生命，放出永不熄灭的光芒。他的死，重于泰山。成千上万的红卫兵小将，怀着无比崇敬的心情，从各地来到钱塘江大桥，向一心为公的共产主义战士、无产阶级文化大革命的忠诚保卫者蔡永祥烈士学习、致敬。
    ?　蔡永祥同志的英雄形象，永远活在我们的心中。我们要像蔡永祥那样，永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想；要像蔡永祥那样，活学活用毛主席著作，树立一心为公的共产主义思想；要像蔡永祥那样，保持高度革命警惕性，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，加强战备，防止美帝国主义及其帮凶的突然袭击。
