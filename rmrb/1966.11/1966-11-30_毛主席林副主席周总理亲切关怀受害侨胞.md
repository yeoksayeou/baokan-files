In a telegram to the second batch of Indonesian overseas Chinese returning to China, Liao Chengzhi conveyed the greetings of the great leader. The overseas Chinese were filled with enthusiasm, cheering loudly, and repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, November 29th: At the welcoming ceremony held today by the people of Guangdong Province and Zhanjiang City for the second batch of Indonesian overseas Chinese who suffered persecution, Liao Chengzhi, the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the chairman of the Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese, read a telegram of greeting to the persecuted overseas Chinese. This telegram conveyed the warm concern and greetings of our great leader Chairman Mao, his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Premier Zhou Enlai to the Indonesian overseas Chinese who suffered persecution. When this telegram was read at the meeting, the entire venue was in an uproar, with cheers echoing, and the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" resounding endlessly. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

Dear Overseas Chinese Compatriots,

Our great leader Chairman Mao, his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and Premier Zhou Enlai are deeply concerned about you. They have asked me to convey their warm concern and greetings to you!

You have endured immense suffering under the brutal persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries, with your health severely damaged. However, to uphold the dignity of our motherland, you have maintained your national integrity, remained united, and resolutely fought against the persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries. You have shown the unyielding spirit of the Chinese people. We pay you the highest respect!

We warmly welcome the 41 overseas Chinese youth who have returned to China victorious. They were illegally arrested and tortured by the military authorities in Medan but remained unyielding. Their heroic struggle is a shining example for overseas Chinese. In the "refugee camp" of Medan Chinese Middle School, the refugees drove away the American provocateurs and resolutely repelled the attack of more than 400 right-wing thugs organized by the military authorities. Their just actions have inspired the broad masses of overseas Chinese who are fighting against persecution.

Under the rampant persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries, the broad masses of overseas Chinese have had to engage in necessary self-defense and resistance. They are right and have done well! They have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, loving Chairman Mao and the motherland, fearing neither hardship nor sacrifice, daring to struggle, and being good at struggling. This revolutionary spirit is worthy of learning by overseas Chinese.

While the Indonesian reactionaries are expanding their anti-China and anti-Chinese activities at the same time as we are transporting the persecuted overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China, this is something we cannot tolerate. We firmly demand that the Indonesian government immediately stop its anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. The Chinese government will continue to take effective measures to protect the legitimate rights of Indonesian overseas Chinese. The stubborn actions of the Indonesian reactionaries in intensifying anti-China and anti-Chinese activities will only lead to their own downfall.

We warmly welcome you back to the motherland. Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, together with the people of the entire country, actively participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland.

Currently, our country is undergoing an unprecedented, magnificent, and vigorous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This cultural revolution aims to thoroughly criticize and repudiate the bourgeois "self" and thoroughly establish the proletarian "public." It aims to thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, transform our worldview, uproot the roots of revisionism, consolidate and develop the socialist system, and make our great motherland an iron-clad fortress of the proletariat.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: The entire country should be turned into a revolutionary school that combines work, agriculture, culture, and military affairs. The entire Party and the people of the entire country are actively responding to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. I sincerely wish you, upon arriving at your production and work posts, to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, master Mao Zedong Thought, promote your own ideological revolutionization, work hard in production, work hard in your jobs, and train hard in military affairs, becoming a new generation of communists.

I wish you great progress and greater contributions in participating in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland and in studying Chairman Mao's works!

    毛主席林副主席周总理亲切关怀受害侨胞
    廖承志在给第二批回国印尼受害华侨的电报中转达了伟大领袖的慰问。侨胞们热情沸腾，欢声雷动，不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    新华社湛江二十九日电　在今天举行的广东省和湛江市各界人民欢迎第二批回国印尼受害华侨的大会上，宣读了华侨事务委员会主任、接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任委员廖承志给受害华侨的慰问电。这封电报转达了我们的伟大领袖毛主席、他的亲密战友林彪副主席和周恩来总理对印尼受害华侨的亲切关怀和慰问。当这封电报在大会上宣读时，全场沸腾，欢声雷动，“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的口号声经久不息。这封电报全文如下：亲爱的侨胞们：
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席、他的亲密战友林彪副主席和周恩来总理非常关心你们，他们让我转达对你们的亲切关怀和慰问！
    你们在印尼反动派的残酷迫害下，备受折磨，健康受到极大的损害。但是你们为了维护祖国的尊严，坚持民族气节，团结一致，对印尼反动派的迫害进行了坚决的斗争，始终不屈，表现了中国人民的硬骨头精神。我们向你们致以崇高的敬意！
    我们热烈欢迎四十一名华侨青少年胜利回国。他们被棉兰陆军当局无理逮捕、严刑拷打，威武不屈。他们的英勇顽强的斗争事迹，是海外华侨的光辉榜样。在棉兰华侨中学“收容所”里的难侨，怒逐前来挑衅的美国佬，坚决打退陆军当局组织的四百多名右派暴徒的进攻。他们的正义行动，鼓舞着正在进行反迫害斗争的广大华侨。
    在印尼反动派的猖狂迫害下，广大华侨被迫进行了必要的自卫反抗。他们做得对，做得好！他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，热爱毛主席，热爱祖国，不怕困难，不怕牺牲，敢于斗争，善于斗争，这种革命精神，是值得海外华侨学习的。
    印尼反动派在我们接运自愿回国的受害华侨的同时，竟然加紧扩大反华排华活动，这是我们决不能容忍的。我们坚决要求印尼政府立即停止反华排华活动。我国政府将继续采取有效的措施，保护印尼华侨的正当权益。印尼反动派一意孤行，加紧反华排华，只能自食其恶果。
    我们热烈地欢迎你们回到祖国，在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，同全国人民一道，积极参加祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    当前我国正在进行一场史无前例的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命。这场文化大革命，就是要大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，就是要大立毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，改造我们的世界观，挖掉修正主义根子，巩固和发展社会主义制度，使我们伟大的祖国成为无产阶级的铁打江山。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：全国都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校。全党全国积极响应林彪副主席的号召，正在把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，推向一个新的阶段。我衷心祝愿你们，在即将到达的生产、工作岗位上，努力学习毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想学到手，促进自己的思想革命化，好好生产，好好工作，好好练武，做共产主义的一代新人。
    祝你们在参加祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在学习毛主席著作中，取得更大的进步，作出更大的贡献！
                        廖承志一九六六年十一月二十八日
