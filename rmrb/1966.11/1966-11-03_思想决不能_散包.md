The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Harbor" revolves around the dramatic conflict surrounding the "loose packaging" incident involving young worker Han Xiaqiang. It portrays the heroic image of dock workers in the 1960s, with Party branch secretary Fang Haizhen providing significant education and inspiration.

Fang Haizhen's ability to excel in such urgent and difficult circumstances is the result of her emphasis on politics and Mao Zedong Thought, and her focus on the ideological transformation of people. She firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teachings and never forgets class struggle. When the loose packaging incident occurred and young worker Han Xiaqiang requested a job transfer, while the retained worker Qian Shouwei made snide remarks, she immediately connected these phenomena. She realized that "production cannot forget political leadership" and that "class struggle is everywhere on the journey." She immediately elevated the loose packaging incident to the level of class struggle. She keenly saw that the loose packaging incident was not just a momentary oversight or mistake in work, but rather that "thoughts are loose, so the packages are loose; thoughts are wrong, so the packages are wrong."

The facts are indeed like this. Han Xiaqiang is a descendant of dock workers, growing up singing "The East is Red" and wearing a red scarf. He participated in dock loading and unloading work and, under the guidance of old workers, performed his job quite well. However, because Mao Zedong Thought had not taken root in his mind, he lacked a correct understanding of the dock workers' labor of "loading and unloading." Therefore, under the attack of "sugar-coated bullets," his thoughts became "loose," almost ruining his political life. This incident illustrates a truth: there is no such thing as "natural redness." Thought determines action; if thoughts are "loose," the "sacks" on one's shoulders will be loose, and chaos is inevitable.

From Han Xiaqiang's loose packaging incident, Fang Haizhen deeply understood that whether Han Xiaqiang could be educated well was a matter of whether the onslaught of bourgeois ideology could be repelled, and whether Mao Zedong Thought could be used to cultivate proletarian revolutionary successors. Driven by a strong sense of political responsibility, Fang Haizhen, with deep proletarian feelings, helped Han Xiaqiang continuously raise his class consciousness. With the internationalist spirit of "each package and each item being connected to global events," she patiently enlightened Han Xiaqiang. Finally, he stood firm in the stormy waves of class struggle. The image of Fang Haizhen vividly tells us: as long as we emphasize politics and Mao Zedong Thought at all times, in all matters, and in all places, and firmly grasp the thread of class struggle, we can distinguish right from wrong in the midst of complex phenomena, correctly judge and solve various problems. Our revolutionary cause will advance, develop, and thrive vibrantly.

    思想决不能“散包”
    中国人民解放军空军某部连长　孔庆平
    革命现代京剧《海港》围绕着青年工人韩小强“散包”事件展开的戏剧冲突，塑造了六十年代中国码头工人的英雄群像，其中党支部书记方海珍给人以很大的教育和启发。
    方海珍所以能在那样紧急困难的情况下出色地完成任务，是她突出政治、突出毛泽东思想，大抓人的思想革命化的结果。她牢牢记着毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级和阶级斗争。当发生了散包事故，青工韩小强请求调动工作，留用人员钱守维在一旁风言风语时，她就警觉地把这些现象联系起来，认识到“抓生产怎能忘了政治先行”，“征途上处处有阶级斗争”，一下子就把散包事件提到阶级斗争的纲上去分析。她敏锐地看到，散包事件不是工作中一时的疏忽和差错，而是“思想散了，包才散；思想错了，包才错。”
    事实正是这样。韩小强是码头工人的后代，是唱着《东方红》，戴着红领巾长大的。他参加了码头装卸工作，在老工人的帮助带动下，工作干得还是不错的。可是，由于毛泽东思想还没有在他的脑子里扎根，他对码头工人“装装卸卸”的劳动还缺乏正确的认识，所以在“用糖衣裹着的炮弹”的攻击下，思想就“散了包”，几乎断送了自己的政治生命。这一事故的发生说明了一个道理：所谓“自来红”是不存在的。思想决定行动，思想“散了包”，肩上的“麻袋”就要散包，就非出乱子不可。
    从韩小强散包的事故里，方海珍深刻地认识到：能不能教育好韩小强，就是能不能击退资产阶级思想猖狂进攻的问题，就是能不能用毛泽东思想造就无产阶级革命接班人的问题。出于强烈的政治责任感，方海珍以深厚的无产阶级感情，帮助小韩不断提高阶级觉悟；用“一包一件”都是“紧连着世界风云”的国际主义精神，耐心地启发韩小强。终于使他在阶级斗争的大风大浪中站稳了脚跟。方海珍这个形象生动地告诉我们：只要时时、事事、处处突出政治、突出毛泽东思想，紧紧抓住了阶级斗争这条纲，就能够在纷繁的事物面前分清是非，正确地判断和解决各种问题，我们的革命事业就能前进，就能发展，就能搞得生动活泼、欣欣向荣。
