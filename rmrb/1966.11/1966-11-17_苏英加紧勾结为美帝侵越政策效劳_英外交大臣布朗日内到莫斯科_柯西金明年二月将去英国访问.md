British Foreign Secretary Brown to Visit Moscow; Kosygin to Visit Britain in February

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in London on the 14th, British Prime Minister Wilson announced in the House of Commons on the evening of the 14th that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Kosygin, will officially visit Britain on February 6th of next year.

Prior to this, the British Foreign Office announced on the 6th that British Foreign Secretary Brown, at the invitation of the Soviet government, will visit Moscow on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. This is a new action by the British Labour government and the Soviet revisionist leadership to intensify their collusion and cooperate with U.S. imperialism in pushing forward their counter-revolutionary strategy of war and peace in Vietnam. It is part of the U.S.-Soviet global deal.

According to reports, during Kosygin's visit to Britain and Brown's visit to the Soviet Union, the main issues to be discussed between the two sides are how to find a way out for the U.S. aggression in Vietnam and the issue of the non-proliferation treaty that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are urgently trying to conclude. Wilson said in the House of Commons on the 14th when answering questions that, "there are no other issues more important than these two in my talks with Kosygin."

Brown said in the House of Commons on the 7th that he hoped to see what could be done to "assist in ending" the Vietnam War through his visit to Moscow. The *Sunday Express* commented on Brown's visit to the Soviet Union, pointing out that he "will certainly explore" the prospects for joint action by Britain and the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue. The actions of Britain and the Soviet Union to tighten their collusion to serve U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam have been highly praised by the U.S. government. Johnson's roving ambassador Harriman, after attending the Manila conference and visiting Britain, said he believed that "the Soviet Union wants to see the end of hostilities in Vietnam." He was "encouraged" by Brown's invitation to visit the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet Union's willingness to discuss the Vietnam issue "is a good sign."

    苏英加紧勾结为美帝侵越政策效劳
    英外交大臣布朗日内到莫斯科　柯西金明年二月将去英国访问
    据新华社伦敦十四日电　英国首相威尔逊十四日晚间在下院宣布，苏联部长会议主席柯西金将于明年二月六日到英国进行正式访问。
    在这之前，英国外交部在六日还曾经宣布，英国外交大臣布朗，应苏联政府邀请，定于本月二十二、三两日访问莫斯科。这是英国工党政府和苏联修正主义领导集团加紧勾结，配合美帝国主义在越南问题上推行战、“和”两手反革命策略的新的行动，是美苏进行全球大交易的组成部分。
    据报道，在柯西金访英和布朗访苏期间，双方会谈的主要问题是如何为美国侵越战争寻求出路和美苏正在急谋成交的缔结防止核扩散条约问题。威尔逊十四日在下院回答问题时也说，在他同柯西金的会谈中，“没有其他问题比这两个问题更重要的了”。
    布朗七日在下院曾经表示，他希望通过莫斯科之行，看一看对“协助结束”越南战争“能作些什么”。《星期日快报》在评论布朗访苏一事时指出，他“肯定将在莫斯科探究”英、苏在越南问题上“采取联合行动的前景如何”。英苏加紧勾结为美帝国主义侵越政策效劳的行动，深受美国官方的赏识。约翰逊的巡回大使哈里曼在出席马尼拉会议后访问英国时曾经说，他认为，“苏联是希望看到越南的敌对行动结束的”。他对布朗受邀请访问苏联“感到鼓舞”。他说，苏联愿意讨论越南问题“是一个好的征兆”。
