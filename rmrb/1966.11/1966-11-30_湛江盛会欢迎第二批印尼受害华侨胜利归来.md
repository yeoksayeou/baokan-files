Our nation will never again be a nation that is humiliated by others. We have stood up.

A grand gathering in Zhanjiang welcomes the second batch of Indonesian victimized overseas Chinese returning home in triumph.

Representatives of the overseas Chinese youth and returning overseas Chinese expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to build a stronger and more beautiful socialist motherland together with the people of the motherland.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, November 29th — Today, people from various sectors of Guangdong Province and Zhanjiang City held a grand rally to warmly welcome the second batch of Indonesian victimized overseas Chinese returning home aboard the Guanghua Ship.

The welcoming ceremony was held at the Zhanjiang People's Auditorium. Inside and outside the venue, large banners read, "The socialist motherland led by Chairman Mao is the strongest backing for overseas Chinese," "Salute to the patriotic overseas Chinese who have fought bravely to uphold national dignity," and so on. Beside the stage, two large boards with Chairman Mao's quotations shone with the solemn proclamation to the world: "Our nation will never again be a nation that is humiliated by others. We have stood up." "The lifespan of imperialism will not be long. They have done evil deeds, and all oppressed peoples of the world will not forgive them."

Under the call of Mao Zedong Thought, the overseas Chinese who braved numerous obstacles set by the Indonesian reactionaries to return to the motherland, wearing shining Mao badges on their chests and holding red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, joyfully participated in the welcoming ceremony. When the 41 overseas Chinese youth who had fought bravely for 40 days in an Indonesian prison stepped onto the stage, the entire venue repeatedly shouted, "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" "Salute to the patriotic overseas Chinese who have fought bravely to uphold national dignity!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

The meeting began with the solemn melody of "The East Is Red." After the director of the Zhanjiang District Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese, Feng Ziren, delivered a welcome speech, the meeting first read the telegram of condolence from the director of the State Council for Overseas Chinese Affairs and the director of the Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese, Liao Chengzhi, to the second batch of returning Indonesian victimized overseas Chinese.

Then, the representative of the State Council for Overseas Chinese Affairs, Zhu Yi, spoke at the meeting, expressing the most sincere condolences and the warmest welcome to the second batch of returning Indonesian victimized overseas Chinese. He said, although the Indonesian reactionaries used savage violence against unarmed overseas Chinese, violence could not intimidate patriotic overseas Chinese. Especially the 41 overseas Chinese youth who were unlawfully detained for 40 days by the military authorities in Medan, they were fearless and unyielding, standing firm against the savage persecution by the Indonesian reactionaries. Their heroic spirit greatly boosted the morale of the people and crushed the enemy's arrogance. They composed another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought with their brave struggle. They are indeed excellent overseas Chinese youth with a glorious patriotic tradition, worthy sons and daughters of the great motherland, and good overseas Chinese of the Mao Zedong era. Their heroic deeds are shining examples of the struggle of overseas Chinese abroad.

Zhu Yi expressed strong indignation and the strongest protest against the recent intensified anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese activities by the Indonesian government. He said: Since our government sent ships to bring back overseas Chinese, the Indonesian government has begun or continued to expand forced relocations in Aceh, North and South Sumatra, West Java, Central Java, South Sulawesi, and other places, further depriving the vast majority of overseas Chinese of their livelihoods, driving them out of their homes, pushing them to the brink of ruin, and continuously and indefinitely expanding anti-China activities. We solemnly warn the Indonesian government: What you are doing is absolutely unacceptable. You are only lifting a stone to drop it on your own feet, and you will not have a good outcome.

The deputy governor of Guangdong Province, Zeng Sheng, on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, and the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese, warmly welcomed and cordially condoled the overseas Chinese who braved numerous obstacles to return to the motherland.

Zhu Zenghua, deputy director of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and deputy director of the Fujian Provincial Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese, who came to Zhanjiang to welcome the victimized overseas Chinese, as well as worker representatives and Red Guard representatives from Zhanjiang City, also spoke at the meeting.

Amidst thunderous applause, the 41 overseas Chinese youth representatives, Wu Zhao'an, and the returning overseas Chinese representative, Liu Ruixia, spoke one after another.

Liu Ruixia, in his speech, expressed deep gratitude to the great leader, Chairman Mao, who understands the hardships of overseas Chinese the most, cares for the situation of overseas Chinese the most, and supports the just struggle of overseas Chinese the most, and sincerely wished Chairman Mao a long life. He reported to the people of the motherland about the overseas Chinese in the "detention center" of the Indonesian-Chinese Middle School in Medan, who bravely fought back against the attacks by right-wing thugs. He expressed his determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the future, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to learn well from the people of the motherland, to keep up with the revolutionary situation of the motherland, and to build a stronger and more beautiful socialist motherland together with the people of the motherland.

The Red Guards from colleges and universities in Zhanjiang City and from other places who came to connect the revolution presented red armbands to the 41 overseas Chinese youth. The 41 overseas Chinese youth, facing the portrait of Chairman Mao, sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." At this moment, many revolutionary youth and Red Guards rushed onto the stage, giving them "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's works.

Not disappointing the trust of the people of the motherland, the crew of the Guanghua Ship, which successfully completed the task of bringing back the second batch of Indonesian victimized overseas Chinese, also participated in the meeting. (With picture)

They sang "The East Is Red" in unison, shouting long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

    我们的民族再也不是被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了
    湛江盛会欢迎第二批印尼受害华侨胜利归来
    难侨青少年代表和归国华侨代表表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，和祖国人民一道把社会主义祖国建设得更强大，更美好
    据新华社湛江二十九日电　广东省和湛江市各界人民今天上午举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎第二批乘光华轮回国的印度尼西亚受害华侨。
    欢迎大会在湛江市人民礼堂举行。会场内外，高悬着“毛主席领导的社会主义祖国是华侨最有力的靠山”、“向坚持民族气节英勇斗争的爱国华侨致敬”等巨幅标语。主席台旁，两幅大型的毛主席语录牌上，闪烁着毛主席向全世界的庄严宣告：“我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了。”“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。”
    在毛泽东思想的感召下，冲破印尼反动派设下的重重障碍胜利回到祖国的侨胞们，胸前挂着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，手里拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，兴高采烈地参加了欢迎大会。当在印尼监狱中进行过四十天英勇斗争的四十一名华侨青少年走上主席台时，全场不断高呼：“打倒印尼反动派！”“向坚持民族气节英勇斗争的爱国华侨致敬！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    大会在庄严的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。湛江专区接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任委员冯志仁致欢迎词以后，大会首先宣读了中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会主任、接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任委员廖承志给第二批回国印尼受害华侨的慰问电。
    接着，华侨事务委员会代表朱毅在会上讲话，向第二批回国的印尼受害华侨表示最亲切的慰问和最热烈的欢迎。他说，尽管印尼反动派用野蛮的暴力行为对付手无寸铁的华侨，但是暴力是吓不倒爱国华侨的。特别是被棉兰陆军当局无理扣押了四十天的四十一名难侨青少年，威武不屈，坚持斗争，顶住了印尼反动派的野蛮迫害。他们的英雄气概大大地长了人民的志气，灭了敌人的威风。他们以自己的英勇斗争，谱写了又一首毛泽东思想的凯歌。他们不愧为有着光荣爱国传统的优秀华侨青年，不愧是伟大祖国的好儿女，不愧是毛泽东时代的好华侨。他们的英雄业绩是国外华侨斗争的光辉榜样。
    朱毅在讲话中对印尼政府最近变本加厉地进行反华排华活动，表示极大的愤慨和最强烈的抗议。他说：自从我国政府派船接侨以来，印尼政府在亚齐、苏门答腊北部和南部、西爪哇、中爪哇、南苏拉威西等地开始或继续扩大迫迁，进一步剥夺广大华侨的生计，把他们赶出家门，推向绝路，不断地、继续地扩大排华。我们严正警告印尼政府：你们这样做是绝对行不通的。你们只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，绝不会有什么好下场。
    广东省副省长曾生代表中共广东省委、广东省人民委员会和广东省接待和安置归国华侨委员会，热烈欢迎和亲切慰问冲破重重障碍回到祖国的难侨。
    专程来湛江迎接受害华侨的福建省华侨事务委员会副主任、福建省接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任委员祝增华，以及湛江市的工人代表和红卫兵代表，也在会上讲了话。
    在暴风雨般的掌声中，四十一名难侨青少年代表吴招安和归国华侨代表刘瑞霞，先后讲了话。
    刘瑞霞在讲话中向最了解华侨疾苦的、最关怀华侨处境的、最支持华侨正义斗争的伟大领袖毛主席致以深切的感谢，衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。他向祖国亲人汇报了在印尼棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”的难侨，英勇反击印尼右派暴徒袭击的事迹。他表示，今后一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，好好向祖国人民学习，跟上祖国的革命形势，和祖国人民一起把社会主义祖国建设得更强大，更美好。
    湛江市大中院校和外地来革命串连的部分红卫兵，在大会上给四十一名难侨青少年戴上了红卫兵袖章。四十一名难侨青少年面对毛主席像，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。这时，许多革命青少年和红卫兵涌上主席台，送给他们“十六条”和毛主席著作。
