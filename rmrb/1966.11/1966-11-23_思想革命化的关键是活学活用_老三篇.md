Dagang Oilfield cadres discuss their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works

The key to ideological revolutionization is to study and apply the "Three Articles"

Every revolutionary must establish a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and everything for the people, so as to remain steadfast and unwavering on the revolutionary path, and forever preserve revolutionary youthfulness.

A recent meeting of over 200 cadres from the Dagang Oilfield leadership was held to discuss the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The cadres, with deep feelings of eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, shared their experiences in studying the "Three Articles" and transforming their worldviews. Seven leading comrades spoke at the meeting. Everyone agreed that this meeting was in line with Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to study and apply the "Three Articles," and was a meeting to learn from the example of the 32111 Drilling Team, to expose one's thoughts, to fight against the "self," and to carry out a revolution in the depths of the soul.

Leading comrades have realized through practice that the "Three Articles" are the fundamentals of revolution. They said: The "Three Articles" have set up three shining examples for us. To revolutionize, one should be like Zhang Side, serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly; to revolutionize, one should be like Norman Bethune, selflessly serving others; to revolutionize, one should be like the old man of the Yugong legend, daring to defy difficulties and being good at overcoming them. The "Three Articles" are the three rulers, the three mirrors, and the three scales of revolution. Every revolutionary must frequently use these three rulers to measure, these three mirrors to reflect, and these three scales to weigh. Only in this way can one remain steadfast and unwavering on the revolutionary path, never wavering for a lifetime. The heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team are examples of studying and applying the "Three Articles." They have truly internalized Chairman Mao's instructions, integrated them into their blood, and put them into action.

The leading cadres who participated in the meeting all agreed: Just as the revolutionary transformation of the workforce is key, the revolutionary transformation of leadership is also key. This lies in diligently studying and applying the "Three Articles," in breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," and in cultivating a worldview of not seeking fame or gain, not fearing hardship or death, and wholeheartedly serving the revolution and everything for the people. How to transform one's worldview? The consensus is that one must use the "Three Articles" as a weapon, be daring and fight against the "self," fearlessly exposing one's thoughts and daring to fight against the "self." If one fears exposure, one cannot revolutionize; to revolutionize, one must not fear exposure. The more thoroughly one exposes one's selfish thoughts, the more one fights against the "self," the more firmly one establishes the "public," and the deeper the roots of Mao Zedong Thought. If one fears exposure and tries to secretly change, one is actually protecting one's shortcomings and seeking a way out for the "self." This approach is fighting selfish thoughts with selfish thoughts, and one will never be able to overcome them. Only by exposing one's selfish thoughts to the public, using Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to criticize them, and letting the masses strictly supervise, can proletarian thought occupy the ground. Everyone agreed that if one does not completely uproot selfish thoughts, the idea of wholeheartedly and thoroughly serving the people cannot be firmly established. Once a person has selfish thoughts, the party's teachings cannot be remembered, there is no proletarian revolutionary scale in one's mind, and right and wrong cannot be distinguished.

Everyone realized that transforming one's worldview must start with small issues, paying attention to both major and minor matters, fighting against selfish thoughts bit by bit, and transforming one's thoughts bit by bit. Fight and change frequently, fight and change repeatedly, like the old man of the Yugong legend who never stops moving mountains every day, always persistently fighting without fatigue. Over time, the effect will be significant, and the soul will become redder and redder.

Many comrades mentioned that transforming one's worldview must be done through practice, transforming the subjective world while transforming the objective world. If one only fights and changes verbally, one is only a verbal revolutionary; if one fights and changes both verbally and in action, one is a complete revolutionary. After analyzing the excellent situation of the battlefield this year, everyone pointed out that in such an excellent situation, one must resolutely and fiercely fight against the thoughts of being satisfied with the status quo, being satisfied with "not bad," and being satisfied with "getting by." Many comrades said that if leaders have the thought of "satisfaction" in their minds, they will lack high standards and strict requirements, will not be able to see things in a two-sided way, and will not be able to continue moving forward; if they have the thought of "satisfaction" in their minds, they will lack a scale to measure problems and will not correct their shortcomings with a sharp knife; with the thought of "satisfaction," work will become sloppy and the mind will become lazy, and if this continues, there will soon be the danger of "peaceful evolution."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In our country, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thought, anti-Marxist thought, will long exist.... The question of who will win in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the realm of ideology has not yet been truly resolved. We must continue to struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thought for a long time." The leading cadres deeply felt that studying the "Three Articles" to transform one's worldview is a need for the socialist cause and a need for the Chinese and world revolution. They must seriously implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, treating the "Three Articles" as lifelong mottos, revolutionizing until old age, studying until old age, applying until old age, and transforming one's soul for a lifetime. Only in this way can one forever preserve revolutionary youthfulness and ensure that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color.

### 思想革命化的关键是活学活用“老三篇”

    大庆油田干部畅谈学习毛主席著作的体会
    思想革命化的关键是活学活用“老三篇”
    每个革命者都要树立一心为革命，一切为人民的世界观，在革命大路上腿不软，志不衰，永葆革命青春
    新华社二十二日讯大庆油田领导机关最近召开了有二百多名领导干部参加的活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。参加会议的干部，怀着永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想的深厚感情，畅谈了自己学习“老三篇”，改造世界观的体会。有七位领导同志在会上发了言。大家一致认为，这次会是贯彻林彪同志指示，活学活用“老三篇”的讲用会，是以32111钻井队为榜样，亮思想，斗“我”字，灵魂深处闹革命的讲用会。
    领导同志们从实践中体会到，“老三篇”是干革命的根本。他们说：“老三篇”给我们树立了三个光辉形象，干革命就应该像张思德那样，全心全意，完全彻底地为人民服务；干革命就应该像白求恩那样，毫不利己，专门利人；干革命就应该像老愚公那样，敢于藐视困难，善于战胜困难。“老三篇”是革命的三把尺子，三面镜子，三个天秤，每个革命者必须经常用这三把尺子量一量，经常用这三面镜子照一照，经常用这三个天秤称一称。这样，才能使自己在革命大路上腿不软，志不衰，一辈子不变节。32111钻井队的英雄们，就是活学活用“老三篇”的榜样，他们真正做到了把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实到行动上。
    参加讲用会的领导干部们一致认为：同职工队伍革命化一样，领导革命化的关键，是苦学苦用“老三篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，树立不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一切为人民的世界观。怎样改造世界观？大家的体会是，必须以“老三篇”为武器，“敢”字当头，“斗”字开道，敢于亮思想，舍得斗“我”字，不怕丑，不怕痛。怕丑就不能革命，革命就不能怕丑。把私心杂念亮得越彻底，把“我”字斗得越臭，“公”字就树得越牢，毛泽东思想的根子就扎得越深。如果怕丑，想偷偷摸摸地改，实际上就是护短，想给“我”字开一条后路。这样做，本身就是带着私心杂念斗私心杂念，永远也斗不倒。只有把私心杂念亮出来示众，用毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器狠批，让广大群众严格监督，“内外夹攻”，这样，无产阶级思想才能占领阵地。大家认为，如果不把私心杂念连根拔掉，全心全意、完全彻底地为人民服务的思想就站不稳。一个人有了私心杂念，党的教导就记不牢，脑子里就没有无产阶级革命的比例尺，是非就分不清。
    大家体会到，改造世界观，必须从细小问题做起，既要注意大节，也不放过小节，寸土必争，一点一滴地同脑子里的私心杂念斗，一点一滴地改造自己的思想。经常斗，经常改，反复斗，反复改，就像愚公每天挖山不止那样，始终坚持不疲倦地斗争，天长日久，成效就大了，灵魂就会越来越红。
    许多同志谈到，改造世界观，必须通过实践来改造，在改造客观世界中改造主观世界。如果只限于口头上斗，口头上改，那只是一个口头上的革命派；不仅口头上斗，而且行动上改，那才是一个完全的革命派。大家分析了今年战区的大好形势后指出，在这样的大好形势下，必须坚决狠斗满足于现状，满足于“还不错”，满足于“过得去”的思想。许多同志说，领导干部脑子里有了“满”字，就没有了高标准、严要求，就不能一分为二，就不能继续前进；脑子里有了“满”字，看问题就没有了尺子，改正缺点就不带刀子；有了“满”字，工作就粗了，脑子也懒了，这样下去，要不多久，就有“和平演变”的危险。
    毛主席教导我们：“在我国，资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想，反马克思主义的思想，还会长期存在。……无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负问题，还没有真正解决。我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。”领导干部们深深感到，狠学“老三篇”改造世界观，是社会主义事业的需要，是中国革命和世界革命的需要，必须认真执行林彪同志的指示，把“老三篇”作为终生的座右铭来学，革命到老学到老，用到老，干一辈子革命，学一辈子“老三篇”，改造一辈子灵魂，才能永葆革命青春，保证无产阶级铁打江山永不变色。（附图片）
