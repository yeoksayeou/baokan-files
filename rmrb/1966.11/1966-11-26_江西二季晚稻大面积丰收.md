Following the bumper harvest of the first season late rice, Jiangxi Province has once again achieved a large-scale harvest of the second season late rice.

The second season late rice is Jiangxi Province's main autumn grain crop. The actual harvest of over 16 million mu (approximately 1,066,667 hectares) across the province indicates that, whether in mountainous areas, hilly regions, lakeside areas, or plains, the vast majority of regions have yields better than last year.
