He loves the "Three Articles" the most. The soldier Yue Chengbo from a certain unit of the Zhejiang Provincial Military Region recalls:

Cai Yongxiang loved reading Chairman Mao's books the most and used the "Three Articles" the best. What I will never forget is the scene two days before his martyrdom when he and I together compiled a program on "Studying the Three Articles."

On the evening of October 8th, he came to me with a bright red copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and asked me to help him compile a program to be performed at the company's evening gathering. I asked him, "What kind of program should we compile?" He said, "I love reading Chairman Mao's works the most, and I love studying the 'Three Articles' the most. Let's compile a fast-paced drum performance on 'Studying the Three Articles'!" Then, he opened Chairman Mao's book, recited while writing, and spent over two hours compiling the program. He then sang it in the rhythm of a fast-paced drum:

"The 'Three Articles' are treasures,
Every sentence is good;
Workers, peasants, and soldiers,
The more you study, the brighter your eyes,
The more you study, the more enlightened you become.
..."

The next day, he used his lunch break to make a set of clappers and began rehearsing. However, just as we were preparing for the performance, Cai Yongxiang martyred himself!

Cai Yongxiang's spirit of loving Chairman Mao's works and the "Three Articles" will forever inspire me to move forward. In the future, I will definitely, like Cai Yongxiang, take the "Three Articles" as my guiding principle, transform my worldview for life, and be a loyal soldier of Chairman Mao for life.

    他最热爱“老三篇”
    浙江省军区某部战士　岳承波
    蔡永祥同志读得最多的是毛主席的书，用得最好的是“老三篇”。最使我难忘的是他在牺牲前两天的晚上，和我一起编写“学习老三篇”节目的情景。
    十月八日晚上，他拿着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》和《毛泽东著作选读》来找我，要我和他一起编写一个节目，准备在连队晚会上演出。我问他：“编个什么节目呢？”他说：“毛主席著作我最最爱读，‘老三篇’我最最爱学，我们就来编个‘学习老三篇’的快板吧！”接着，他翻开毛主席的书，一边念，一边写，花了两个多小时，编好了一个节目。他又以快板的调子唱了起来：
    “‘老三篇’，是法宝，句句内容好；工农兵，不可少，越学眼越亮，越学越开窍。
        ……”
    第二天，他又利用中午休息时间，做了一副“的笃板”，进行排演。可是，正当我们为演出作准备的日子里，蔡永祥同志壮烈地牺牲了！
    蔡永祥同志热爱毛主席著作，热爱“老三篇”的精神，永远鼓舞着我前进。今后，我一定要像蔡永祥同志那样，以“老三篇”为座右铭，改造一辈子世界观，做一辈子毛主席的忠诚战士。
