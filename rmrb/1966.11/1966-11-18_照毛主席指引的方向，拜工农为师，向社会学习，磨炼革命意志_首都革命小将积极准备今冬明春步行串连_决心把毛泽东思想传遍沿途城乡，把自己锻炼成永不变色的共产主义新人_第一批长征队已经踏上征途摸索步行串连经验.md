Revolutionary young people in the capital are actively preparing for winter and spring walking tours

Determined to spread Mao Zedong Thought along the way in cities and countryside, and to temper themselves into steadfast communists

The first batch of Long March teams have set off to explore experiences in walking tours

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: The joyous news of Chairman Mao's support for walking tours has greatly inspired the revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities. They take the revolutionary young people who have walked to Beijing to connect as their examples, actively preparing for planned and organized walking tours to various parts of the country this winter and next spring, to implement Comrade Lin Biao's call for walking tours. Now, the first batch of Long March teams have set off to explore experiences in walking tours.

On November 3rd, after Comrade Lin Biao conveyed the joyous news of Chairman Mao's support for walking tours, the revolutionary young people of the capital's colleges and universities immediately became excited. With hearts full of gratitude, they enthusiastically hailed Chairman Mao's discovery and fostering of this new revolutionary thing, walking tours, guiding the nationwide revolutionary connection to a new stage. They excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's support for our walking tours is the greatest encouragement, the greatest care, and the greatest trust for us." They expressed their determination to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, to learn from workers and peasants on the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao, to learn from society, to let the storms of revolution sweep away the political dust in the depths of their souls, to eliminate the "self" and establish the "public," and to temper and cultivate themselves into steadfast communists through Mao Zedong Thought.

When the revolutionary young people were organizing and preparing the walking tour teams, they unanimously agreed that among all preparations, studying Chairman Mao's works is the most fundamental. They adopted the method of small group training, seriously studying Chairman Mao's teachings on cultivating successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, deeply understanding the profound significance of walking tours. The revolutionary young people of Beijing University's "Long March Team studying the Three Articles" said: "Previously, under the control of the capitalist-roaders in power like Lu Ping, Beijing University was separated from the working people, attempting to drag us into the quagmire of revisionism. We have risen up to rebel against the old education system and urgently need to step out of the small classroom of the school, to go to the large classroom of society to face the wind and rain, to familiarize ourselves with the masses, to familiarize ourselves with society, to understand the class struggle in socialist society, to let the storms of revolution sweep away the political dust in our minds, and to eliminate the influence of bourgeois education thoughts." Revolutionary teachers and students also, with the question of how to conduct social investigations, studied Chairman Mao's work "The Preface and Postscript to 'Investigations in the Countryside'" and read the revolutionary stories of Chairman Mao conducting rural investigations, specifically discussing the purpose, attitude, and methods of conducting social investigations during the Long March. They all expressed their determination to learn from Chairman Mao's great example, with the spirit of being willing to be small students, respectfully learning from workers and peasants, and conducting social investigations. A Red Guard from Renmin University said, "We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching: 'It must be understood that the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable. Without understanding this, one cannot gain even the most basic knowledge.' We will learn to connect with the masses and conduct social investigations during the Long March." Many revolutionary teachers and students of the Long March teams also formulated investigation plans and draft investigation outlines based on issues in the struggle.

Revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards preparing for walking tours invited comrades from the "Long March Red Guard Team" of Dalian Maritime University, the "Mao Zedong Thought Long March Propaganda Team" of Bengbu Railway Middle School, and other walking tour teams to share their experiences and insights. They also visited old Red Army soldiers, old Eighth Route Army soldiers, old poor peasants, and visited the exhibition of the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March, deepening their understanding of the significance of walking tours time and again. A group of revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from Beijing Institute of Machinery who are about to go out for walking tours specially invited some students who were unreasonably ordered to return by the Soviet government to discuss with them how to oppose and prevent revisionism and become successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. The anti-revisionist fighters told the Red Guards that in the Soviet Union, the revisionist leadership is using schools as important battlefields to poison young people. They use bourgeois individualism and the corrupt and decadent bourgeois lifestyle to poison the souls of young people, erode their revolutionary will, and try every means to cultivate successors to the bourgeoisie. The introduction by the returned students deeply educated this group of revolutionary young people. They, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, took the painful example of peaceful evolution among Soviet youth as a mirror, voluntarily examined the "self" in the depths of their souls, and expressed their determination to go to the most difficult places for walking tours, to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works with questions, to conduct a thought revolution of breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," and to swear to be successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

The revolutionary young people, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "the Long March is a declaration, the Long March is a propaganda team, the Long March is a sowing machine," are determined to spread Mao Zedong Thought along the way in cities and villages during the walking tours. In recent days, many revolutionary young people visited the "Exhibition of the People's Liberation Army's Ten-Thousand-Person Propaganda Team in Xingtai Region" held in the capital, deeply moved by the deeds of the PLA soldiers who regard themselves as both the driving force and the object of the revolution, constantly reforming their souls with Mao Zedong Thought. They said that only by regarding the reform of one's own thoughts as important like the PLA soldiers can one become a true propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. Some departing Long March teams decided not to walk through plains, cities, and main roads, but to head towards revolutionary base areas and remote villages. They believe that these areas have harsh conditions, and going to these places can better temper their revolutionary will. A group of female Red Guards in the "Red Female Soldiers Long March Team" decided to walk through mountain gullies and cross steep mountains to head towards Yan'an. They detailed their learning and propaganda plans along the way, preparing to visit Dazhai and the hometown of martyr Liu Huilan, to visit the battlefield of Pingxingguan, and to visit the memorial hall of the Five Heroes of Wolf's Ridge. They said, "We must spread Mao Zedong Thought and bring back the revolutionary spirit of the old base areas." Many Long March teams printed a large number of propaganda materials, and some even made their own slide projectors, bringing slides such as "People of the World Love Chairman Mao," "Chairman Mao Reviews the Cultural Revolution Army," and "Studying Chairman Mao's Quotations," preparing to spread Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go.

The revolutionary spirit of teachers and students determined to walk and connect received enthusiastic support from the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the capital. An old poor peasant, Feng Dekang, from the suburbs of Beijing, heard that the "Red Women's Army Long March Team" of Beijing University was going to walk and connect, hurriedly came to encourage them, and brought them a batch of "Diary of Lei Feng," reminding them to regard Chairman Mao's works as food, weapons, and steering wheels, learning wherever they go. An old Red Army soldier, upon hearing that his 17-year-old daughter was going to walk and connect, was so happy that he told his daughter the story of the Red Army's Long March again, and said to his daughter, "The real classroom is the class struggle of society, the real teachers are the workers and peasants, and the real revolutionary successors can only be cultivated by seriously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the classroom of class struggle and under the education of the workers and peasants."

The members of a Long March team from Beijing Institute of Chemical Engineering responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call for walking tours, took an oath in front of Tiananmen, and set off towards Yan'an. They are determined to spread Mao Zedong Thought along the way, to learn from workers and peasants, to widely contact the masses, to contact society, to understand the situation of class struggle, and to temper and grow in the storms of revolution.

    照毛主席指引的方向，拜工农为师，向社会学习，磨炼革命意志
    首都革命小将积极准备今冬明春步行串连
    决心把毛泽东思想传遍沿途城乡，把自己锻炼成永不变色的共产主义新人
    第一批长征队已经踏上征途摸索步行串连经验
    新华社十七日讯　最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席支持步行串连的喜讯，极大地鼓舞了首都大中学校的革命师生和红卫兵。他们以步行来京串连的各地革命小将为榜样，积极准备今冬明春有计划、有组织地徒步到全国各地去，实现林彪同志提出的步行串连的号召。现在，第一批长征队已经踏上征途，去摸索步行串连的经验。
    十一月三日，林彪同志转达了毛主席支持步行串连的喜讯以后，首都大中学校的革命小将立即沸腾起来。他们以无限感激的心情，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席发现和扶植步行串连这一革命的新事物，指引全国革命大串连走向新阶段。他们兴奋地说：“毛主席支持我们步行串连，是对我们最大的鼓舞，最大的关怀，最大的信任。”他们表示，坚决响应林彪同志的号召，在毛主席指引的革命道路上，拜工农为师，向社会学习，让革命的风雨荡涤灵魂深处的政治灰尘，灭掉“私”字，树立“公”字，用毛泽东思想把自己锻炼培养成为永不变色的共产主义新人。
    革命小将们在酝酿和组织步行串连队时一致认为，千准备，万准备，学好毛主席著作是最根本的准备。他们采取小集训的方式，认真地学习了毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的教导和林彪同志的指示，深刻领会了步行串连的深远意义。北京大学“学习老三篇长征队”的革命小将们说：“过去北京大学在陆平等党内走资本主义道路的当权派的控制下，使我们和劳动人民隔离开来，妄图把我们拉进修正主义的泥坑。我们起来造了旧教育制度的反，迫切地需要走出学校的小课堂，到社会的大课堂去经风雨，见世面，熟悉群众，熟悉社会，了解社会主义社会的阶级斗争，让革命的风雨荡涤自己头脑中的政治灰尘，肃清资产阶级教育思想的影响。”革命师生们还带着怎样做社会调查的问题，学习了毛主席著作《〈农村调查〉的序言和跋》，阅读了记载毛主席从事农村调查的革命故事，具体讨论了在长征中进行社会调查的目的、态度和方法。都表示要学习毛主席的伟大榜样，以甘当小学生的精神，恭恭敬敬地向工农学习，作社会调查。中国人民大学的一个红卫兵说：“我们要牢记毛主席的教导：‘必须明白：群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。’我们在长征中要学会联系群众，学会作社会调查。”许多长征队的革命师生还根据斗争中的问题订了调查计划，拟出调查纲目。
    准备进行徒步串连的革命师生和红卫兵，纷纷邀请大连海运学院“长征红卫队”、蚌埠铁路中学“毛泽东思想长征宣传队”等步行串连队伍的战友，介绍他们长征的经验和体会。他们还通过访问老红军、老八路、老贫农，参观红军二万五千里长征历史展览等活动，一遍又一遍地加深领会步行串连的意义。即将步行外出串连的北京机械学院的一批革命师生和红卫兵，特地邀请被苏联政府无理勒令回国的部分留学生，同他们一起畅谈怎样反对和防止修正主义、做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。反修战士告诉红卫兵们说，在苏联，修正主义领导集团正在把学校当作毒害青年的重要阵地。他们用资产阶级个人主义和腐朽糜烂的资产阶级生活方式毒化青年的灵魂，消磨青年的革命意志，千方百计地培养资产阶级的接班人。留苏学生的介绍，使这批革命小将受到了深刻的教育，他们根据毛主席的教导，以苏联青年中发生和平演变的痛心事例作镜子，自觉地检查自己灵魂深处的“我”字，表示一定要到最艰苦的地方去步行串连，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，进行破私立公的思想革命，誓当无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    革命小将们遵照毛主席“长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机”的教导，决心在徒步串连的过程中把毛泽东思想传播到沿途的城镇和乡村。连日来，不少革命小将参观了正在首都举办的“邢台地区解放军万人宣传队展览馆”，对于解放军战士那种既把自己当作革命的动力，又把自己当成革命的对象，用毛泽东思想不断改造自己灵魂的事迹，深为感动。他们说，只有像解放军战士那样重视改造自己的思想，才有可能做一个真正的毛泽东思想的宣传员。一些将出发的长征队决定，不走平川、城市和大道，而向革命老根据地和穷乡僻壤进发。他们认为，这些地区条件艰苦，到这些地方去，更能磨炼自己的革命意志。一支“红女兵长征队”的小将们决心走山沟、跨峻岭，奔赴延安。她们详细制定了沿途学习和宣传计划，准备访问大寨和刘胡兰烈士的故乡，参观平型关战场，参观狼牙山五壮士纪念馆等。她们说：“一定要把毛泽东思想传播出去，把老根据地的革命精神带回来。”许多长征队油印了大量的宣传品，有的还自己动手制作了幻灯机，带上世界人民热爱毛主席、毛主席检阅文化革命大军、学习毛主席语录等幻灯片，准备走到哪里就把毛泽东思想宣传到哪里。
    革命师生决心徒步串连的革命精神，受到首都工农兵群众的热情支持。北京郊区的一个老贫农冯德芳知道北京大学“红色娘子军长征队”要去步行串连，连忙赶来鼓励她们，给她们送来了一批《雷锋日记》，叮嘱她们要像雷锋那样，把毛主席著作当作粮食、武器、方向盘，走到哪里学到哪里。有位老红军听说自己十七岁的女儿要去步行串连，高兴得又一次给女儿讲述红军长征的故事，还对他的女儿说：“真正的课堂是社会的阶级斗争，真正的老师是工农群众，真正的革命接班人，只有认真活学活用毛主席著作，在阶级斗争的大课堂里，在工农群众的教育下才能培养出来。”（附图片）
