The Red Guards and the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Together
— A Few Stories of the "Long March Red Guards" of Shandong Linshi Jingzhong Agricultural School

	One day, the "Long March Red Guards" marched to Dongxin Brigade in Huanghua County, Hebei Province. It was already dark. As soon as they entered the village, they saw that all the villagers were studying Chairman Mao's works. The Red Guards were deeply moved to see the poor and lower-middle peasants so devoted to Mao Zedong Thought. They read Mao's quotations together with the villagers and distributed the single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works they had brought. The villagers were overjoyed and said, "You've brought us a treasure of books! We must study Chairman Mao's books well." When it was time to leave, the women's team leader specially wrote down her address and name for the Red Guards and repeatedly instructed them, "When you see Chairman Mao, be sure to bring us a message right away. We will feel as if we have seen Chairman Mao!"

	Before setting out, three female team members discussed, "Let's embroider a large red flag to present to our beloved Chairman Mao whom we think of day and night!" "Yes, yes, this red flag represents that we are a small fighting force under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and it represents our eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao!" They had bought more than a zhang of red cloth at home. To see Chairman Mao sooner, the three female team members decided to embroider it during the march. As soon as the team arrived at Zhi Fang Brigade in Yangxin County, they put down their backpacks and the three team members began to embroider carefully. The brigade's league branch secretary enthusiastically suggested, "Embroidering stitch by stitch like this, it will take days to finish! We have sewing machines here, it will be done in an instant!" The three female team members hurriedly said, "The red flag we embroider with our own hands can best express our boundless love for Chairman Mao!" The league branch secretary smiled and said, "Alright, let me call a few sisters to help you embroider, to express our love for Chairman Mao too!" Before they could react, she snatched the red flag from the female team members' hands and ran off in an instant. Where could they find her? The female team members were so anxious that they were fuming. Later, they managed to find out where the red flag was. A few of them rushed to the villager's home, pushed open the door, and saw that the whole room was filled with women surrounding the large red flag. Everyone wanted to embroider a few stitches on the red flag, everyone wanted to dedicate their love to Chairman Mao!

	During the march, everyone saw the withered branches and fallen leaves by the roadside and picked them up to use as firewood on the march. Once, the firewood ran out, and the team members borrowed a few bundles of firewood from the landlord's old man. The next day before leaving, the team members, learning from the PLA's three disciplines and eight points for attention, quietly left the money under the oil lamp and then set off with their backpacks. After walking for a while, the team members suddenly saw someone riding a bicycle coming towards them at full speed. Upon closer inspection, it was the landlord's old man. This old peasant was sweating profusely as he rushed over, just to return the firewood money. The old man wanted to return the money, but the Red Guards firmly refused. They pushed and pulled like this for a long time. Finally, the old man laughed and said, "Hey! These young people are really Chairman Mao's good children!"

	Red Guard member Cui Fuyuan took a shiny red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and went to a poor peasant family to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The white-haired grandmother, upon hearing that the young man had brought Mao Zedong Thought to her home, hurriedly brought out a small stool for him to sit on. At this time, the whole family gathered around to listen. After listening to Cui Fuyuan's explanation of Mao's quotation about criticizing the attitude of "not my business, I'll just hang back," the grandmother nodded and said, "Chairman Mao is so right! In the past, when I saw someone picking crops in the field, I thought it wasn't much, just a little for each person. I was afraid of causing trouble, so I just 'hung back.' From now on, I will listen to Chairman Mao's words, and if I see someone damaging collective interests, I will fight with them!" After eight days of marching, Cui Fuyuan deeply felt that the poor and lower-middle peasants loved Mao Zedong Thought the most and understood it the best. He also loved Mao Zedong Thought even more.

    红卫兵和贫下中农在一起
    ——山东临淄敬仲农业中学“长征赤卫队”的几个故事
    尤明
    一起学毛主席著作
    有一天，“长征赤卫队”行军到河北省黄骅县东辛大队，天早黑了。一进村，全村社员正好都在学习毛主席著作。红卫兵看到贫下中农这样热爱毛泽东思想，十分感动。他们同群众一起读毛主席语录，还把带来的毛主席著作单行本分送给群众。社员们高兴极了，都说：“你们给咱们送宝书来啦！我们一定要好好学习毛主席的书。”临别时，妇女队长特意把自己的地址和名字写给红卫兵，一再交代说：“你们一见毛主席，千万马上给我们捎个信儿，我们也就像见了毛主席一样！”
    把阶级的心意绣在红旗上
    出发前，三个女队员合计：“绣一面大红旗献给我们日夜思念的毛主席吧！”“对，对，这面红旗表示我们是毛主席领导下的一支小小的战斗队，表示我们永远忠于毛主席！”她们在家时就买了一丈多红布，为了早些见到毛主席，三个女队员决定在行军途中赶绣出来。队伍一到阳信县纸坊大队，放下背包，三个队员就细心地绣起来了。大队团支部书记热情地劝道：“这么一针一针绣，到那天才绣好哩！咱们这儿有缝纫机，一会儿就缝好啦！”三位女队员忙说：“我们亲手一针一针绣出来的红旗，才能表示我们对毛主席无限热爱的心意啊！”团支部书记笑着说：“那好，让我叫几位姐妹来帮你们绣，也表表我们对毛主席的心意吧！”她口里说着，冷不防一把从女队员手里把红旗夺了过去，转眼就跑得没影儿了。到哪里找她呢？女队员们急得心里冒烟。后来好容易打听到红旗的下落，几个人赶到那个社员的家里，推开门一看，嗬！一屋子妇女全围着那面大红旗，谁都想为红旗绣几针，谁都想把自己的心意献给毛主席！
    学习解放军的传统
    行军途中，大伙儿看到路边的枯枝落叶，就拾起来放在行军车上当烧柴。有一次，烧柴不够了，队员们就向房东老大爷借了几把柴禾。第二天临走前，队员们学习解放军的三大纪律八项注意，悄悄地把钱压在油灯下，才背起背包上路。走了一段路，队员们猛然发现有人骑着自行车飞也似的赶来。到跟前一看，原来是房东老大爷。这位贫农老大爷满头大汗地赶来，就为把柴禾钱退还。老大爷要退钱，红卫兵坚决不肯。就这样你推我让好大一会工夫。最后，老大爷笑呵呵地说：“嗨！这些年青人呀，真是毛主席的好孩子！”
    当个毛泽东思想的宣传员
    红卫兵崔复元拿起一本红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，到一户贫农社员家宣传毛泽东思想。白发大娘听说年青人给她家送来毛泽东思想，忙端出小板凳让他坐。这时，一家大小都围着他听。大娘听崔复元讲毛主席关于批评“事不关己，高高挂起”的这条语录后，点点头说：“毛主席说得可对哩！早先看见有人在地里掐庄稼，觉得不多点儿，一人才摊上多少？我恐怕惹人不满，就‘高高挂起’啦！从今以后，我得听毛主席的话，看到谁损害集体利益，我就跟谁斗争！”经过八天行军，崔复元深深体会到贫下中农最热爱毛泽东思想，最懂得毛泽东思想。他对毛泽东思想也更热爱了。
