The Indonesian reactionaries are terrified of revolutionary truth and attempt to ban all Marxist-Leninist books in the country with a single order.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 7th, news from Jakarta: The right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia recently issued an order prohibiting the Indonesian people from possessing and storing any propaganda materials advocating communism and Marxism-Leninism, in a vain attempt to obstruct the spread of Marxism-Leninism revolutionary truth in Indonesia.

According to a report from the Antara News Agency, a group named the "Special Committee for Controlling Communist and Marxist-Leninist Doctrines" announced on the 3rd that from November 2nd, it is forbidden to possess and store books, magazines, or other propaganda materials advocating communism and Marxism-Leninism.

This order stipulates that all residents of Jakarta, printing houses, bookstores, libraries, universities, middle and primary schools, government departments, and other units that possess and store such propaganda materials must destroy or hand them over within 30 days from November 2nd. Those who violate this order will be sentenced to imprisonment and fined.

The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces fear that if the Indonesian people grasp the revolutionary truth of Marxism-Leninism, it will hasten their own doom. However, their adoption of this reactionary measure of book burning and burying scholars will absolutely not save them from their inevitable fate of destruction. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly be victorious."

    印尼反动派对革命真理怕得要死
    妄图凭一纸命令在国内禁止一切马列主义书籍
    据新华社七日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派反动势力最近下令禁止印尼人民持有和保存一切宣传共产主义、马克思列宁主义的宣传品，妄图阻止马克思列宁主义革命真理在印度尼西亚的传播。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，一个名为“管制共产主义、马克思列宁主义学说特别小组”在三日宣布，从十一月二日起禁止保存和持有宣传共产主义、马克思列宁主义的书籍、杂志或其他宣传品。
    这项禁令宣布，雅加达的全体居民、印刷所、书店、图书馆、大学、中小学、政府各部和其他部门，凡是保存和持有这类宣传品的，必须在从十一月二日起的三十天内予以销毁或交出。违者将被判处徒刑和罚款。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力害怕马克思列宁主义的革命真理为印尼人民所掌握，会加速它们的末日的到来。但是它们采取这一焚书坑儒的反动措施，绝对挽救不了它们必定灭亡的命运。正如毛泽东主席所说：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
