The organ newspaper of the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization, *El Intransigente*, recently published an article titled "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" The article states: "Mao Zedong Thought is the complete ideological weapon of contemporary revolutionaries. With this ideological weapon, one can shoulder and accomplish the greatest historical mission of the international communist movement—driving U.S. imperialism out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and opening a new era in human history."

The article praises the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution as a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. It says that China's cultural revolution and Mao Zedong Thought are inseparable and have decisive significance for the future of the world revolution.

The article points out, "Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism because it solves new problems in class struggle that the founders of Marxism did not encounter, and it also solves many old problems that Marxism-Leninism has not solved for the first time."

The article emphasizes, "Mao Zedong's wisdom summarizes the revolutionary abilities of the Chinese proletariat and the world proletariat, as well as the oppressed peoples, reaching an unprecedented level. Mao Zedong has inherited and defended the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and applied them in the specific conditions of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, thus enriching these teachings. This creative application of Marxism-Leninism has pushed dialectical materialism to its highest level."

The article says that in the long process of revolution and socialist construction in China, "Mao Zedong Thought has withstood the great test of class struggle, proving it to be absolutely correct." The article points out, "Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon to lead the world revolutionary tide to final victory."

The article says that the Mao Zedong Thought guiding the proletarian cultural revolution, which is grasped by the Chinese masses, "should also be grasped by all communists and revolutionary masses around the world." The article says, "Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a powerful material force. It is the wealth of the Chinese people and all the people of the world. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are invincible in the three great revolutionary struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment."

The article says: Only a new type of Marxist-Leninist party can shoulder the great historical mission of eliminating imperialist forces and leading the people's wars in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to victory. Only the new type of Marxist-Leninist warriors educated by Mao Zedong Thought can be worthy of the glorious title of communists in this great era.

The article says that the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization requires its members to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate themselves, transform their thoughts, and apply Mao Zedong Thought to concretely develop the political line of the Communist Vanguard Organization. It should use Mao Zedong Thought as the master key to solving all problems and overcoming all difficulties, and apply Mao Zedong Thought to rebuild the Argentine Communist Party.

The article concludes with the slogans: "Long live the Mao Zedong era! Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!"

    阿根廷共产主义先锋组织机关报强调指出
    用毛泽东思想教育自己和改造思想
    中国文化大革命对世界革命前途具有决定意义
    新华社讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷共产主义先锋组织机关报《不妥协报》最近发表题为《毛泽东思想万岁》的文章指出：“毛泽东思想是当代革命者的完整思想武器，有了这个思想武器就能担负和实现国际共产主义运动最伟大的历史任务——把美帝国主义赶出亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，开创人类历史的新时代。”
    文章赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命是毛泽东思想的胜利。文章说，中国的文化革命和毛泽东思想密不可分，对于世界革命的前途具有决定的意义。
    文章指出，“毛泽东思想是达到最高水平的马克思列宁主义，因为它解决了马克思主义奠基人没有遇到过的在阶级斗争中提出的新问题，同时它第一次解决了马克思列宁主义所没有解决的许多老问题。”
    文章强调指出：“毛泽东的智慧概括了中国无产阶级和世界无产阶级以及被压迫人民的革命才能，而达到前所未有的水平”。“毛泽东继承和捍卫了马克思列宁主义的学说，并在中国革命和世界革命的具体条件下加以运用，从而更加丰富了这些学说。这种创造性的运用马克思列宁主义，把唯物辩证法推进到最高的水平。”
    文章说，在中国长期的革命和社会主义建设过程中，“毛泽东思想经受了阶级斗争的巨大考验，证明它是绝对正确的。”文章指出：“毛泽东思想是把世界革命的浪潮引向最后胜利的最强大武器。”
    文章说，指导无产阶级文化革命的、为中国群众所掌握的毛泽东思想，“也应该为全世界共产主义者和革命群众所掌握。”文章说：“毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成一种强大的物质力量，它是中国人民和全世界人民的财富。中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命斗争中无往不胜。”
    文章说：只有新型的马克思列宁主义政党，才能担负起消灭帝国主义势力和把亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民战争引向胜利的巨大历史使命。只有用毛泽东思想教育成长的新型的马克思列宁主义战士，才能无愧于我们这个伟大时代的共产主义者的光荣称号。
    文章说，阿根廷共产主义先锋组织要求它的成员用毛泽东思想来教育自己，改造思想，并且运用毛泽东思想来具体发展共产主义先锋组织的政治路线，把毛泽东思想作为解决一切问题和克服一切困难的万能钥匙，应用毛泽东思想来重建阿根廷共产党。
    文章最后高呼：“毛泽东时代万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！毛泽东同志万岁！”
