The Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour held a grand banquet on November 8 in the Guerrilla Palace to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour and the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Party.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, Enver Hoxha, the member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mehmet Shehu, and the Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly, Haxhi Lleshi, and other party and state leaders attended the banquet.

The Chinese Communist Party delegation, led by Comrade Kang Sheng, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat, and Comrade Li Xiannian, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat, as well as delegations from other communist parties, workers' parties, and Marxist-Leninist organizations, were invited to attend the banquet.

Comrade Mehmet Shehu made a toast at the banquet. He said that the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Party and the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the founding of our glorious Party are two great festivals for the Albanian communists and all the Albanian people. Our Party has never been as strong and united as it is today in celebrating its great festivals.

He said that, as pointed out by our Party's Fifth Congress, our Party is always full of unlimited revolutionary optimism about the future, ready to shoulder all responsibilities, and prepared to make all sacrifices for the happiness of the people and the motherland, for the cause of the world revolution, and for the cause of Marxism-Leninism.

He said that our people are building socialism under the encirclement and vicious blockade of imperialism and revisionism. It is our daily and extremely important responsibility to constantly heighten our revolutionary vigilance, constantly strengthen our national defense forces, and be ready to fight at any time. The enemy cannot stop us from advancing on the road to socialism and communism, and they cannot stop us from implementing the resolutions of the Fifth Congress.

He said that the Fifth Congress once again confirmed that our socialist construction is inseparable from the struggle against imperialism led by American imperialism and against modern revisionism led by the traitorous clique of the Soviet Communist Party. We will unswervingly fulfill this sacred internationalist duty.

Shehu said, The glorious delegation of the Communist Party of China and the delegations of other communist parties, workers' parties, and Marxist-Leninist organizations participating in the congress of the Party of Labour are a great event that further strengthens the unity and common struggle of Marxist-Leninists around the world. We are confident that the sparks of new Marxist-Leninist organizations that are igniting in every corner of the world will become a raging fire, burning and destroying imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries from the face of the earth.

Shehu said, Our Party, as always, will stand shoulder to shoulder with our comrades and close friends—the great and glorious Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao Zedong—in the common struggle to oppose imperialism and modern revisionism, defend socialism, and strive for the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

The banquet was held in a very warm and friendly atmosphere. The Guerrilla Palace in Tirana was brightly lit. Party and state leaders of Albania, representatives of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, and hundreds of representatives from communist parties, workers' parties, and Marxist-Leninist organizations from various countries gathered together, frequently raising toasts to the Party of Labour of Albania and its leader, Enver Hoxha. They also toasted to the victory of the struggle of Marxist-Leninists around the world against imperialism and revisionism. During the banquet, leaders and representatives of the Party of Labour of Albania repeatedly sang revolutionary songs, expressing the Albanian Party of Labour and people's optimistic mood and vigorous revolutionary spirit towards the future victory.

    欢庆五大胜利闭幕和建党光荣节日
    霍查、谢胡、列希等同志和中共代表团及兄弟党代表团出席
    谢胡同志祝酒时说，兄弟党代表团参加阿党代表大会，增强了全世界马列主义者的团结。新的马列主义组织在世界各个角落点燃的星星之火，必将变成反帝反修的熊熊烈火。
    新华社地拉那九日电  阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会八日在这里的游击队宫举行盛大宴会，热烈隆重地庆祝阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会胜利闭幕和劳动党成立二十五周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记恩·霍查，劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议主席穆·谢胡，人民议会主席团主席哈·列希等党和国家领导人出席了宴会。
    由团长、中共中央政治局常务委员、中央书记处书记康生，副团长、中共中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记李先念率领的中国共产党代表团，以及其他共产党、工人党和马克思列宁主义组织的代表团应邀出席了宴会。
    谢胡同志在宴会上祝酒。他说，党的第五次代表大会胜利闭幕和欢度我们光荣的党成立二十五周年，对于阿尔巴尼亚共产党人和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民来说，是两个盛大的节日。我们的党在庆祝自己伟大的节日的时候，从来没有像今天这样强大和紧密团结。
    他说，正如我们党第五次代表大会所指出的，我们党对未来始终充满着无限的革命乐观主义精神，随时准备挑起一切担子，准备为人民和祖国的幸福事业，为世界革命事业，为马克思列宁主义事业作出一切牺牲。
    他说，我国人民是在帝国主义和修正主义的包围和凶恶封锁的情况下建设社会主义的。不断提高革命警惕性，不断巩固国防力量，随时准备战斗——这是我们每天的和极为重要的责任。敌人阻止不了我们在社会主义和共产主义的道路上前进，阻止不了我们实现第五次代表大会的决议。
    他说，第五次代表大会再一次证实，我国的社会主义建设事业是同反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和反对以苏共领导叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义的斗争分不开的。我们将始终不渝地完成这一神圣的国际主义义务。
    谢胡说，光荣的中国共产党代表团以及其他共产党、工人党和马克思列宁主义组织的代表团参加劳动党的代表大会，是进一步增强全世界马克思列宁主义者的团结和共同斗争的巨大事件。我们坚信，各个新的马克思列宁主义组织正在世界各个角落点燃起来的星星之火必将变成熊熊烈火，把帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派从地球上烧毁、消灭干净。
    谢胡说，我们党将一如既往，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义、捍卫社会主义、争取马克思列宁主义的胜利的共同斗争中，肩并肩地同我们党和我国人民的同志和亲密朋友——毛泽东主席所领导的人民中国的伟大和光荣的共产党在一起。
    宴会是在极为热烈友好的气氛中进行的。地拉那游击队宫灯火辉煌。阿尔巴尼亚党和国家领导人同劳动党第五次代表大会代表以及各国共产党、工人党和马克思列宁主义组织的代表数百人欢聚一堂，频频为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党及其领袖恩维尔·霍查同志干杯；为世界马克思列宁主义者反对帝国主义和反对修正主义斗争的胜利干杯。席间，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导人和代表们不断高唱革命歌曲，表现了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民对未来胜利的乐观情绪和生气勃勃的革命精神。
