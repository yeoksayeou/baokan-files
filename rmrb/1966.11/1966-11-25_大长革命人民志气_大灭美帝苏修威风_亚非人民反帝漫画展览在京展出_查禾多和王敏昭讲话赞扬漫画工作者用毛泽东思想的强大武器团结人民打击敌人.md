The "Anti-Imperialist Cartoon Exhibition by Asian and African Peoples," which reflects the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples, opened grandly in Beijing today.

The exhibition, organized by the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, features more than 180 works. These works were provided by revolutionary cartoonists and journalists from 22 countries and regions in Asia and Africa. This is an exhibition that greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa and crushes the arrogance of the enemy.

Revolutionary cartoonists and journalists from Asia and Africa, together with the people of various countries, have deeply felt through revolutionary practice that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples. They love Chairman Mao deeply and enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought in their works, extolling the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao. They also use their pens as weapons, with sharp and powerful strokes, to expose the paper tiger nature of American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries; to expose the shameful faces of the Soviet revisionists who betray the revolution and act as henchmen of American imperialism; and to enthusiastically sing the praises of the unity of the Asian and African peoples, and the surging revolutionary struggles and great victories achieved by the Asian and African peoples. The cartoons on display here are the first review of anti-imperialist cartoon creation in Asia and Africa, and a major event in the political life of the Asian and African peoples.

This large-scale exhibition is set up in the Chinese Art Museum. In the central hall, a full-body statue of our great leader Chairman Mao stands tall. On the walls on either side hang red banners with the words: "Under the leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, the Chinese people resolutely support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of all the peoples of the world!" "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the peoples of the world, and the revolutionary peoples of the world love Mao Zedong Thought!" On the front wall are the words of Chairman Mao: "The people of the world, unite and defeat the American aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, not be afraid of difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All devils will be annihilated."

At the opening ceremony attended by more than a thousand Chinese and foreign guests, Chahardol, Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, and Wang Minzhao, Acting President of the All-China Journalists' Association, delivered enthusiastic speeches.

Chahardol pointed out that at a time when the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing, the "Anti-Imperialist Cartoon Exhibition by Asian and African Peoples" opens in Beijing, the world's revolutionary stronghold, which is of great historical significance. Chahardol said that this exhibition is a fighting exhibition, a revolutionary exhibition, serving the revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples, the patriotic struggles of the peoples of various countries, and further strengthening the revolutionary unity of the peoples of various countries, and also serving the world revolution.

Chahardol said that from the cartoons on display here, one can see how imperialism, modern revisionism, fascism, and reactionaries are being struck and ridiculed in various places in Asia and Africa. All these cartoons once again prove that the anti-imperialist struggles of the Asian and African peoples are deepening. He expressed his belief that this cartoon exhibition will further strengthen the fighting unity of the cartoonists, journalists, and all the peoples of Asia and Africa.

He said that at the moment our exhibition is held in Beijing, it is precisely the period when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, is at its height. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a driving force, the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, have already and are continuing to achieve great successes in all aspects.

The high revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, their love for Chairman Mao, and their high awareness of internationalist duty are all expressed in the works provided by Chinese artists.

Wang Minzhao, in his speech, praised the Asian-African Journalists' Association as a progressive, revolutionary, and combative organization of journalists from Asia and Africa. He said it has consistently held high the banner of revolution and made significant contributions to the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries. He also praised the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, led by Chahardol, for its unremitting struggle to uphold and defend the correct line of the Asian-African journalists' unity and anti-imperialist movement.

He said that at the height of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, the exhibition organized by the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the banner of revolution and struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, is a powerful encouragement to the peoples of various countries in Asia and Africa who are engaged in struggle. It is a great support for the people and revolution of our country.

When talking about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, Wang Minzhao said, "We, the Chinese people, will definitely not disappoint the expectations of the revolutionary peoples of the world. We will definitely carry the cultural revolution to the end, thereby more powerfully supporting and helping the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world, and fulfilling our great internationalist duty of the proletariat."

Wang Minzhao said that more and more cartoonists from Asia and Africa have realized that only by mastering and applying Mao Zedong Thought can the art form of cartoons become a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy. In their works, they have conducted ruthless criticism and exposure of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa, boosting their own morale, and crushing the arrogance of the enemy.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Asian and African Countries, and other relevant officials such as Zhang Shiqi, Han Nianlong, Chu Tunan, Li Qi, Tang Pingzhuo, Hu Chi, Ding Leifu, and Li Wei attended the opening ceremony. Also present at the opening ceremony were the secretaries of the Asian-African Journalists' Association in Beijing from various countries. Famous American black leader Robert F. Williams, Japanese peace activist Nishizono Teru, Lao leader Mrs. Kuaning Bounsang, ambassadors, chargé d'affaires, and cultural attachés from some countries to China, and Asian and African friends in Beijing were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

    大长革命人民志气　大灭美帝苏修威风
    亚非人民反帝漫画展览在京展出
    查禾多和王敏昭讲话赞扬漫画工作者用毛泽东思想的强大武器团结人民打击敌人
    新华社二十四日讯  反映亚非人民反帝革命斗争的“亚非人民反帝漫画展览”，今天在北京隆重开幕。
    由亚非新闻工作者协会书记处举办的这个漫画展览，共展出一百八十多幅作品。这些作品是由亚非二十二个国家和地区的革命的漫画工作者和新闻工作者提供的。这是一次大长亚非革命人民志气，大灭敌人威风的展览会。
    亚非革命的漫画工作者和新闻工作者，同各国人民在一起，通过革命的实践，深深体会到毛泽东思想是亚非革命人民进行革命斗争的最强大的思想武器。他们无比热爱毛主席，并且在自己的作品中热情颂扬毛泽东思想，赞扬在毛主席亲自领导下胜利进行的无产阶级文化大革命。他们还把自己的笔作为武器，以锐利的笔锋，有力地揭露美帝国主义和各国反动派外强中干的纸老虎本质；揭露苏联修正主义者背叛革命、充当美帝国主义帮凶的可耻面目；热情地歌颂亚非人民的团结，歌颂亚非人民革命斗争的高涨和所取得的伟大胜利。在这里展出的漫画，是亚非反帝漫画创作的第一次检阅，是亚非人民政治生活中的一件大事。
    这个规模巨大的展览设在中国美术馆。展览馆的中央大厅里，屹立着我们伟大领袖毛主席的全身塑像。两旁的墙壁上挂着红色横幅，上面写着：“在伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席领导下的中国人民坚决支持全世界人民的反帝革命斗争！”“毛主席是世界人民心中的红太阳，全世界革命人民热爱毛泽东思想！”大厅正面写着毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    在有一千多位中外人士参加的开幕式上，亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，中华全国新闻工作者协会代理主任王敏昭先后发表了热情的讲话。
    查禾多指出，在亚非拉人民反帝革命斗争正在蓬勃发展的时刻，“亚非人民反帝漫画展览”在世界革命的堡垒——北京开幕，这是具有重大历史意义的。查禾多说，这个展览会是战斗的展览会，革命的展览会，是为亚非人民革命服务的，为各国人民的爱国斗争服务的，为进一步加强各国人民革命团结服务的，也是为世界革命服务的。
    查禾多说，从这里展出的漫画可以看到，帝国主义、现代修正主义、法西斯主义和反动派在亚非各地如何遭到打击和讽刺。所有这些漫画又一次证明，亚非人民反帝斗争正在深入发展。他表示相信，这个漫画展览将进一步加强亚非漫画家、新闻工作者和全体人民的战斗团结。
    他说，我们的展览会在北京举行的时刻，正是毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命处于高潮的时期。以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，并以无产阶级文化大革命为推动力的中国人民，在伟大领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导下，已经并正在各方面取得巨大的成就。
    中国人民的高度革命精神，对毛泽东主席的热爱，以及国际主义义务的高度自觉精神，都在中国艺术家提供的作品里表达出来了。
    王敏昭在讲话中赞扬说，亚非新闻工作者协会，是亚非两大洲进步的、革命的、富有战斗性的新闻工作者组织，它一贯高举革命的红旗，为亚非人民和全世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，作出了重大的贡献。他还赞扬以查禾多为首的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处，为坚决贯彻和捍卫亚非新闻工作者团结反帝运动的正确路线，进行了不懈的斗争。
    他说，在我国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处举办的这个展览会，高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举起反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义以及反对各国反动派的革命战斗的旗帜，这是对正在进行斗争中的亚非各国人民的有力鼓舞，这是对我国人民，我国革命的一个巨大支持。
    谈到毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命的时候，王敏昭说，我们中国人民一定不辜负全世界革命人民对我们的期望，一定要把这场文化大革命进行到底，从而更有力地支持和帮助全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，完成我们应当担负的无产阶级国际主义的伟大义务。
    王敏昭说，越来越多的亚非漫画工作者认识到，只有掌握和运用毛泽东思想，才能使漫画这一种艺术形式，成为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。他们在作品中对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派进行了无情的批判和揭露，大大地鼓舞了亚非革命人民的斗志，长了自己的志气，灭了敌人的威风。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主任郭沫若，中国亚非团结委员会主任廖承志，以及其他有关方面负责人张奚若、韩念龙、楚图南、李琦、唐平铸、胡痴、丁莱夫、李伟等出席了开幕式。出席开幕式的，还有亚非新闻工作者协会书记处在北京的各国书记。著名的美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉，日本和平人士西园寺公一，老挝人士贵宁·奔舍那夫人，一些国家驻中国的大使、代办和大使馆文化官员，在北京的亚非各国朋友，也应邀出席了开幕式。
