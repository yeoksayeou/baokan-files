Today, in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as we fiercely attack the bourgeois reactionary line, commemorating the great communist warrior Lu Xun holds immense significance for us in persevering with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution until we achieve final victory.

Lu Xun's life was one of struggle and revolution. He dedicated his entire life to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. Our great leader Chairman Mao has given him the highest praise.

We Red Guards commemorate Lu Xun to learn from his revolutionary spirit, to follow his example in fiercely opposing imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and revisionism, and to be like him, "frowning at a thousand pointing fingers, humbly serving the people."

At the same time we commemorate Lu Xun, the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party are taking the opportunity to stir up a malicious wind, viciously slandering Lu Xun and launching vicious attacks on our Cultural Revolution.

There is a scoundrel in the Soviet Union named Simonov, a thoroughly despicable and shameless person, a great traitor to the Soviet revolution. At the time of Stalin's death, he wrote, "...there is no language that can express how we mourn you, Comrade Stalin." But soon after, before the ink on his words had dried, he followed Khrushchev's lead, slandering, cursing, and attacking Stalin, cursing the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union. He wrote one stinking, long revisionist work after another, slandering Stalin and the Soviet people, becoming the vanguard of anti-Stalinism. This representative of the high-salaried class, this new bourgeois aristocrat in the Soviet Union, wrote an article in the October 18 issue of the Soviet *Literary Gazette*, using the pretext of commemorating Lu Xun to slander the great communist warrior Lu Xun and attack our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We absolutely will not allow this traitor to defile Lu Xun's glorious name.

In his article, this Simonov lord shamelessly shouts, "What is happening in China and what is called the 'Cultural Revolution' is a phenomenon that is out of step with the people and is temporary."

Chairman Mao teaches us, "...if the enemy does not oppose us, that would be bad, that would mean we are colluding with the enemy. If the enemy opposes us, that is good, that means we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, calling us worthless and useless, that would be even better, that means not only have we drawn a clear line with the enemy, but also that our work has achieved great success."

Simonov says our Cultural Revolution is "out of step" with them. For you revisionists, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is indeed out of step. You are the lackeys of imperialism, the good sons and grandsons of revisionism. We are opposing you, and everything we do, how can you feel comfortable? The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will thoroughly wash away these stinking, disgusting trash. Of course, you are terrified and hateful. Do you dare to post big-character posters nationwide like we do? Do you dare to let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend like we do? Do you dare to travel in large groups like we do? Do you dare to organize the Red Guards like we do? You dare not, you are terrified and trembling with fear. If you dared to do so, you would not be able to live for even one day. You can only ride on the backs of the people and drink their blood and eat their flesh.

Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. If they flatter us, would we not be colluding with the enemy?

This donkey-like fool dreams that our revolution is only a "temporary phenomenon." Give up that hope! We Red Guards will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We will oppose everything that does not align with Mao Zedong Thought. We will thoroughly uproot the poisonous roots of imperialism and revisionism, pulling them out by the roots. We will fight to the end until all demons and monsters in the world are eliminated, and we will not stop until we achieve complete victory!

This Simonov lord, in his madness, shouts that we are engaged in a "rude and despicable anti-Soviet chorus." In fact, the true anti-Soviets are not us, but Simonov and these revisionists who use their stinking pens to slander the glorious history of the Soviet people. Simonov and his gang write novels, make movies, act in plays, and write poems to defame Stalin, defame the Red Army, and defame the Soviet people, portraying the socialist society under Stalin's leadership as a dark abyss. Isn't this the most despicable anti-Sovietism? In fact, today the Soviet revisionist lords are engaged in a frenzied and despicable anti-China chorus. You follow behind the U.S. imperialists, shouting loudly like mad dogs, biting people everywhere. When the U.S. says east, you dare not say west. When the U.S. says the sun is black, you dare not say it is red. You lie everywhere, spread rumors everywhere, slander maliciously and curse freely, everywhere you promote the philosophy of survival, selling out everything for a few scraps of food. You sing in harmony with the U.S. imperialists, trying to sell out the revolution of the Vietnamese people to the U.S. imperialists. In the past, you brutally suppressed the just demonstrations of revolutionary students from various countries in the Soviet Union, causing heavy casualties. Recently, you have gone even further by expelling all our students studying in the Soviet Union. All your actions prove that you are the leaders of the anti-China chorus, and you are the ones engaged in a "rude and despicable anti-China chorus."

Simonov also shouts that Lu Xun's name has become "more resonant and purer." Lu Xun's name is resonant and pure because he is a vanguard warrior on the cultural front of the proletariat, the most resolute revolutionary rebel. His bones are the hardest, his love and hate are the clearest, and his stance is the firmest. You, such a despicable traitor, have no right to mention Lu Xun's name! We Red Guards warn Simonov: You think you can use this to defame the reputation of the Chinese people and elevate yourself. This is all in vain, it is the braying of a donkey, and it will only be spit upon by the revolutionary people. You traitors are shamefaced before Lu Xun.

We, the little red soldiers of Chairman Mao, the red rebels, firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought as the most powerful weapon, taking Lu Xun as our example, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end! We will make the sky Mao Zedong's sky, the earth Mao Zedong's earth, and the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought! We will plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world! We will revolution to the end! Rebel to the end! Contribute our youth and blood to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat worldwide!

We vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

Eternally loyal to Chairman Mao!

Eternally loyal to Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live, long, long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    斥西蒙诺夫
    北京长征中学（四十四中）学生　刘路
    今天，我们在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火的时候，纪念伟大的共产主义战士鲁迅，对于我们坚持把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，直到取得最后胜利，是有着重大意义的。
    鲁迅的一生是战斗的一生、革命的一生，他把毕生精力献给了中国人民的革命事业。我们伟大的领袖毛主席对他作了极高的评价。
    我们红卫兵纪念鲁迅，就是要学习他的革命精神，像他那样大造帝国主义的反，大造资产阶级的反，大造修正主义的反，像他那样“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”。
    就在我们纪念鲁迅的同时，以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者却趁机刮起一股妖风，大肆诬蔑鲁迅，对我国的文化大革命进行恶毒攻击。
    苏联有个家伙叫西蒙诺夫的，是个十分卑鄙无耻的小人，是苏联革命的大叛徒。斯大林逝世时，他还写道：“……没有哪样的语言，能陈述出我们怎样地哀悼你斯大林同志。……”曾几何时，他的墨迹还没干，就紧紧跟在赫鲁晓夫的屁股后面，大肆诬蔑、咒骂和攻击斯大林，咒骂苏联的无产阶级专政，写了一部又一部又臭又长的诬蔑斯大林、诬蔑苏联人民的修正主义作品，成了反斯大林的急先锋。就是这个高薪阶层代表人物，苏联的资产阶级新贵族，在今年十月十八日的苏联《文学报》上写了一篇文章，借口纪念鲁迅，诬蔑伟大的共产主义战士鲁迅，攻击我国的无产阶级文化大革命。我们绝不允许这个大叛徒玷污鲁迅的光辉名字。
    这个西蒙诺夫老爷在文章中猖狂地叫喊：“现在在中国发生的和名为‘文化革命’的一切，是一种与人民格格不入的和暂时的现象”。
    毛主席教导我们：“……如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    西蒙诺夫老爷说我们文化革命和他们“格格不入”。对你们这种修正主义者来说，无产阶级文化大革命当然是格格不入的。你们是帝国主义的奴才，是修正主义的孝子贤孙，我们要造你们的反，我们所做的一切，你们怎么会舒服呢？无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，把你们这些令人作呕的臭气冲天的垃圾，彻底冲洗掉，你们当然怕得要死。恨得要死。你们敢像我们那样发动全国人民贴大字报吗？敢大鸣大放吗？敢大串连吗？敢组织红卫兵吗？你们不敢，你们怕得心惊肉跳，如果你们敢这样做的话，就一天也活不下去的。你们只会骑在人民头上喝血吃肉。
    被敌人反对是好事，而不是坏事，如果他们恭维我们的话，那我们岂不是同敌人同流合污了吗？
    这像驴一样愚蠢的老爷，梦想我们的革命只不过是
  “暂时的现象”。你们死了这条心吧！我们革命的红卫兵，就是要将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们就是要造一切不符合毛泽东思想的反，我们就是要彻底挖掉帝国主义、修正主义的毒根，把它连根拔掉。我们就是要干到底，直到世界上一切妖魔鬼怪统统消灭，不获全胜绝不收兵！
    这个西蒙诺夫老爷丧心病狂地叫嚷我们在进行“粗暴而卑鄙的反苏叫嚷大合唱”。事实上，真正反苏的，不是我们，而是西蒙诺夫这种用他那支臭笔诬蔑苏联人民光荣历史的修正主义者。西蒙诺夫一伙人，写小说、拍电影、演戏、写诗大肆丑化斯大林，丑化苏联红军，丑化苏联人民，把斯大林领导下的苏联社会主义社会写成漆黑一团，这不是大反苏吗？这不是最无耻的反苏吗？事实上，今天苏修老爷们正在进行疯狂而卑鄙的反华大合唱。你们跟在美帝国主义的屁股后面，起劲地叫嚷，如同疯狗一样到处咬人。美帝说东你不敢说西，美帝说太阳是黑的你不敢说是红的。你们到处撒谎，到处造谣，到处恶毒诬蔑、任意谩骂，到处宣传活命哲学，为了一些残汤剩饭，什么革命、什么真理，一切的一切，都可以出卖。你们处处和美帝一唱一和，妄图把越南人民的革命出卖给美帝国主义。过去你们残酷镇压各国留苏革命学生的正义示威游行，造成惨重的流血事件。最近你们又更进一步的把我国留苏学生都给赶了回来。你们所有的言行都证明你们是反华大合唱的头子，你们才是在进行“粗暴而卑鄙的反华叫嚷大合唱”。
    西蒙诺夫还叫喊什么鲁迅的名字“更响亮，更纯洁了”。鲁迅的名字之所以响亮，之所以纯洁，是因为他是无产阶级文化战线的先锋战士，是最坚决的革命造反者，他的骨头最硬、爱憎最分明、立场最坚定。像你这种卑鄙的叛徒，没有资格提到鲁迅的名字！我们红卫兵警告西蒙诺夫：你想借此来破坏中国人民的名誉，抬高自己，这只不过是煞费苦心，是驴子的叫声，只能遭到革命人民的唾弃。你们这种叛徒在鲁迅面前，是无地自容的。
    我们毛主席的红小兵、红色的造反者，坚决高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，以鲁迅为榜样，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我们要让天是毛泽东的天，地是毛泽东的地，人是毛泽东思想武装起来的人！要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全世界！我们要革命到底！造反到底！为全世界的无产阶级革命事业贡献出我们的青春和热血！
    誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    永远忠于毛主席！
    永远忠于毛泽东思想！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
