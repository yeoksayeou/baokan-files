The second batch of more than a thousand Indonesian victims of persecution arrived in Zhanjiang aboard the Guanghua ship.

The victory of the struggle to receive overseas Chinese is another victory for Mao Zedong Thought. Ten thousand people lined the streets to welcome the patriotic overseas Chinese who bravely fought against the Indonesian reactionaries and returned to the embrace of their motherland. Forty-one overseas Chinese youths received the warmest welcome from their fellow countrymen.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, November 28 - The second batch of 1,076 Indonesian victims of persecution who returned aboard the Guanghua ship arrived at Zhanjiang Port this afternoon. Tens of thousands of fellow countrymen lined the streets from the port to the accommodation for the victims, cheering for the victory of the struggle to receive overseas Chinese, which is another victory for Mao Zedong Thought. They enthusiastically welcomed the patriotic overseas Chinese who bravely fought against the Indonesian reactionaries and returned to the embrace of their motherland.

Zhanjiang City presented a scene of joy and excitement today. Red flags fluttered everywhere in the squares and streets inside and outside the port area, and many buildings displayed large banners reading "The socialist motherland led by Chairman Mao is the strongest support for overseas Chinese" and "Salute to the overseas Chinese who bravely fight for national dignity." Two groups of colorful balloons, each bearing a long banner reading "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" and "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!", floated in the blue sky. The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country, who had gathered from all directions, beat drums and gongs, sang revolutionary songs, and surged towards the port area. The welcoming crowd stretched from the port all the way to the building of the Overseas Chinese Service Corporation, where the victims were accommodated, a distance of about a mile.

Around 1:00 PM, a distant ocean liner, flying the portrait of Chairman Mao and red flags, and sounding its horn, slowly approached the pier. The pier immediately erupted in cheers, and the music of "The East is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" filled the sky. The welcoming crowd waved the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," flower garlands, and ribbons, paying tribute to the returning overseas Chinese. The returning victims, who had gathered on the deck and along the ship's railings, continuously shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang revolutionary songs, waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," portraits of Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought plaques, expressing their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the great socialist motherland. Countless faces showed excitement and pride, and countless eyes welled up with tears of joy.

The forty-one victims who had bravely fought in the Indonesian reactionaries' prison for forty days, sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" in formation as they descended the ship's gangway. As soon as they set foot on the motherland, they were greeted with the warmest welcome from their fellow countrymen. Thousands of enthusiastic hands reached out to them, and their hands were tightly grasped. Countless revolutionary youths and Red Guards rushed to them, presenting them with the most precious gifts: Mao Zedong statues, Mao Zedong badges, and Mao Zedong's "Three Articles." The revolutionary youths and Red Guards excitedly expressed to the forty-one young heroes, "Learn from you, salute you!" Yu Yazhou, who walked at the front of the forty-one young victims, replied with the greatest passion, "Learn from the revolutionary youths and Red Guards of the motherland! Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study Chairman Mao's works diligently, and become good successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause." Wang Youxing, an advanced worker from the Zhanjiang Port Bureau, and Wu Dichen, an advanced worker from the Zhanjiang Agricultural Machinery Factory, two activists who studied Chairman Mao's works, represented the workers of Zhanjiang City and presented the forty-one young heroes with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" inscribed on the cover with "Salute to the patriotic overseas Chinese who bravely fight for national dignity," hoping that they would make new contributions to the socialist motherland.

Some of the victims returning this time were victims of the incident on November 9, when the military authorities in Medan incited mobs to attack the "refugee camp" for victims at the Indonesian Chinese School in Medan. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, resolved to fight to the end, fearing no sacrifice, and conducted a tenacious struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries until they drove the mobs out of the "refugee camp." Today, when these patriotic overseas Chinese who participated in the struggle against the mobs stepped onto the pier with a sense of victory, the welcoming crowd applauded them thousands of times, paying tribute and expressing concern. Liang Chuanghan, an activist who studied Chairman Mao's works and a model worker from the Zhanjiang Transportation Company, presented a Mao Zedong badge he had recently received at the Zhanjiang Special District Conference of Activists Who Studied Chairman Mao's Works to the patriotic overseas Chinese. He said excitedly, "You are truly the good sons and daughters of the motherland! We must learn from your spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, build our socialist motherland even stronger, and make her an even stronger support for the broad masses of overseas Chinese."

Qiu Yuelan and Yu Yaxiu, whose husbands were wrongfully killed by Indonesian mobs, returned to the motherland with their children today. They were so moved that tears streamed down their faces, and they repeatedly held up the portraits of Chairman Mao and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" They recounted to the welcoming fellow countrymen the fascist atrocities committed by the Indonesian reactionaries in killing their loved ones. Qiu Yuelan angrily denounced, "My husband, Ye Baixiang, had lived in Yogyakarta for over thirty years and had always gotten along well with the local people. On October 12 last year, the right-wing mobs suddenly attacked the Chinese in Yogyakarta, and my family was looted. My husband was beaten to death. My family of five was then driven to Medan by the local right-wing authorities and suffered persecution." She angrily said, "I want to report to the people of the motherland, to the people of the world, that blood debts must be repaid with blood!"

Among this batch of returning victims, many had their health severely damaged under the brutal persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries. When medical staff and crew members carried the injured and sick victims off the ship on stretchers, the crowd on the pier was indignant, repeatedly raising their arms and shouting slogans such as "Strongly protest the Indonesian reactionaries' persecution of overseas Chinese."

Today, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province and Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese, Zeng Shen, specially came to Zhanjiang to welcome the victims. The responsible person from the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, as well as the responsible persons from the Zhanjiang Special District and Zhanjiang City, were also at the pier to welcome the returning overseas Chinese.

    第二批一千多名印尼受害华侨乘光华轮到湛江
    接侨斗争的胜利是毛泽东思想的又一胜利
    万人夹道欢迎向印尼反动派进行英勇斗争的爱国侨胞胜利回到祖国怀抱。四十一名华侨青少年受到祖国亲人最热烈的欢迎
    新华社湛江二十八日电　第二批乘光华轮回国的一千零七十六名印度尼西亚受害华侨，今天下午到达湛江港。上万的祖国亲人，在从港口直到难侨住地的路上，夹道欢呼这次接侨斗争的胜利是毛泽东思想的又一个胜利，热烈欢迎在印尼反动派面前不怕牺牲、敢于斗争的爱国侨胞胜利回到祖国怀抱。
    湛江市今天呈现着一片欢腾的景象。港区内外的广场上和马路上到处红旗招展，许多建筑物上悬挂着“毛主席领导的社会主义祖国是华侨最有力的靠山”、“向坚持民族气节英勇斗争的侨胞致敬”等巨幅标语。两组彩色气球，高悬着“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”的长幅标语，在蔚蓝的天空中迎风飘动。当地广大工农群众、革命干部和来自全国各地的革命师生、红卫兵，鸣锣擂鼓，高唱革命歌曲，从四面八方涌向港区。夹道欢迎的队伍一直从港口绵延到接待难侨住宿的华侨服务社大楼附近，长达一里。
    下午一时许，湛蓝的港湾海面上，一艘高悬着毛主席画像的远洋巨轮，飘扬着红旗，鸣着汽笛，朝着港岸码头徐徐驶来。码头上顿时欢声雷动，《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》的乐曲声响彻天空。欢迎的人群挥动着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，挥动着花环、彩带，向胜利归来的侨胞们致敬。早就聚集在甲板上、船舷旁的归国难侨，不停地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”高唱革命歌曲，挥动着《毛主席语录》、毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，表达了他们对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大社会主义祖国的无限热爱。无数张激动的脸孔流露着兴奋、自豪的感情，无数双眼睛涌出了激动的泪花。
    在印尼反动派的监狱中进行四十天英勇斗争的四十一名难侨青少年，高唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，列队走下船梯。他们一踏上祖国的土地，就受到祖国亲人最热烈的欢迎。千万双热情的手伸向他们，同他们的手紧紧相握。无数的革命青少年和红卫兵涌向他们，把毛主席塑像、毛主席像章和毛主席的“老三篇”等最珍贵的礼物，送到他们手上。革命青少年和红卫兵们向四十一位小英雄激动地表示：“向你们学习，向你们致敬！”走在四十一名难侨青少年行列前面的余亚周怀着最大的激情回答说：“向祖国革命青少年和红卫兵学习！让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力学好毛主席著作，当好无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”湛江市港务局先进生产者王友兴和湛江市农业机械厂先进生产者伍帝成这两位学习毛主席著作积极分子，代表湛江市工人，把在扉页上写有“向坚持民族气节英勇斗争的爱国华侨致敬”的《毛主席语录》赠给了四十一位小英雄，希望他们为社会主义祖国作出新的贡献。
    这次回国的难侨，有一部分是在十一月九日棉兰陆军当局唆使暴徒袭击棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”事件中的受害者。他们遵循毛主席的教导，下定决心，不怕牺牲，坚持同印尼反动派进行顽强的抗暴斗争，直到把暴徒赶出了“收容所”。今天，当这些参加抗暴斗争的爱国侨胞带着胜利的激情走上码头时，欢迎的人群千百遍地热烈鼓掌，向他们致敬和慰问。学习毛主席著作积极分子、湛江市运输公司五好职工梁创汉，把自己不久前出席湛江专区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议时获得的一枚毛主席像章送给了爱国侨胞，并且激动万分地对他们说：你们真不愧是祖国的好儿女！我们要学习你们敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神，把社会主义祖国建设得更加富强，使她成为广大华侨更有力的靠山。
    丈夫无辜惨遭印度尼西亚暴徒杀害的妇女丘月兰、余亚秀，今天带着儿女回到祖国。她们激动得热泪滚滚，高举手中的毛主席画像，不断高呼“毛主席万岁！”她们向前来欢迎的祖国亲人，控诉了印尼反动派惨杀她们亲人的法西斯暴行。丘月兰愤怒地控诉说：我的丈夫叶栢祥，在印尼亚齐南必力侨居三十多年，一直同当地人民友好相处。去年十月十二日，印尼右派暴徒突然袭击南必力华侨，我一家遭受洗劫，丈夫也被他们活活打死了。我一家五口，又被当地右派当局赶到棉兰，饱受迫害。她愤怒地说，我要向祖国人民控诉，向全世界人民控诉，血债一定要用血来还！
    这一批回国的难侨中，有许多人在印尼反动派的残酷迫害下，健康受到严重摧残。当医务人员和船员用担架把伤病的难侨抬下船时，码头上群情激愤，不断振臂高呼“强烈抗议印尼反动派迫害华侨”等口号。
    今天，广东省副省长、广东省接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任委员曾生，专程前来湛江迎接难侨的福建省华侨事务委员会负责人，以及湛江专区和湛江市的负责人等，都到码头欢迎归来的侨胞。（附图片）
