Youth in Caixi Eagerly Spread Mao Zedong Thought

They have established fifteen propaganda stations, going to the fields and to every household to spread propaganda, and the spirits of the commune members have greatly improved.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: Chairman Mao once conducted investigations in Caixi Township, Shanghang County, Fujian Province—now Caixi Commune. Fifteen Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Stations have already been organized there. More than seventy young people serving as propagandists go to the hills, the fields, before and after various meetings, and to the markets every morning and evening. They spread Mao Zedong Thought through reading aloud, explaining, and singing folk songs, and guide commune members in studying Chairman Mao's works. The masses enthusiastically praise them as the most glorious Mao Zedong Thought propagandists.

The first propagandist of the propaganda station is Wang Shilan, the daughter of a poor peasant and a Communist Party member. Wang Shilan loves to read Chairman Mao's works. After studying articles like the "Old Three," she understood that a young person in the countryside must be red in the countryside and dedicated to the countryside. In 1963, she returned to Caixi from Tianjin. She thought that just her own study was not enough; everyone must study for the effect to be great. Therefore, she used her rest time to carry Chairman Mao's works, going door to door to read to the commune members, and also sang mountain songs. Last year, Wang Shilan connected with a few educated youth, using rest time to go up the mountain to chop firewood, sold it, and bought forty-eight individual volumes of Chairman Mao's works, two radio sets, and made a small red flag, formally establishing the first Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Station in Caixi Commune. Many young people learned from Wang Shilan and also organized Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Stations. Now, Caixi Commune has organized fifteen Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Stations. Since last year, their footsteps have reached every household, and their voices spreading Mao Zedong Thought have entered the ears of every commune member.

Now, almost every commune member in Caixi Commune has bought Chairman Mao's books. As soon as they see the red flag of the propaganda station and hear the voices of the propagandists, they take out Chairman Mao's works and gather around, listening attentively, taking notes carefully, and studying diligently. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of Caixi have changed, the land has changed, and the villages have changed. Some people who used to only see their own doorsteps now look towards the entire world; some people who used to only have a small family in their hearts now have the socialist collective in their hearts.

    才溪青少年热情传播毛泽东思想
    他们建立了十五个宣传站，到田间到各户进行宣传，社员精神面貌大变
    据新华社福州电  毛主席曾经在那里做过调查的福建省上杭县才溪乡——现在的才溪公社，已经组织起十五个毛泽东思想宣传站。担任宣传员的七十多个青少年，每天早晚在山岗上、在田头，在各种会议的前后，在集市上，用朗读、讲解和民歌等形式，宣传毛泽东思想，辅导社员学习毛主席著作。群众热情地称赞他们是最光荣的毛泽东思想宣传员。
    宣传站的头一个宣传员，是贫农的女儿、共产党员王石兰。王石兰爱读毛主席的著作，她学习了“老三篇”等文章以后，懂得了一个农村青年必须红在农村，专在农村。一九六三年，她从天津回到才溪。她想，光自己学习还不够，必须大家学，作用才大。于是，她利用休息时间，拿着毛主席著作，挨门逐户地给社员们念，还用山歌唱。去年，王石兰串连了几个知识青年，利用休息时间上山砍柴，卖了钱，买了四十八本毛主席著作单行本，两个广播筒，制了一面小红旗，正式成立了才溪公社第一个毛泽东思想宣传站。许多青少年学习王石兰，也纷纷组织了毛泽东思想宣传站。现在，才溪公社已组织起十五个毛泽东思想宣传站。自去年以来，他们的足迹遍及每家每户，他们宣传毛泽东思想的声音，注入每个社员的耳中。
    现在，才溪公社的社员几乎人人都买了毛主席的书，他们一看到宣传站的红旗，一听到宣传员的声音，就拿起毛主席著作围拢过来，静心听，细心记，用心学。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，才溪人变，地变，村庄变。有些人过去只看到家门口，如今瞻望着全世界；有些人心窝里过去只有一个小家庭，如今装进了社会主义的大集体。
