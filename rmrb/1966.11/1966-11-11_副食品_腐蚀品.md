    "Side Dishes" - Corrosive Goods
    Deputy Squad Leader Wu Runsheng

    Zhou Yang said that literature and art can be divided into "beneficial, harmless, and harmful" categories. What he calls "harmless and beneficial" are works that, in his words, "do not express political content" and are "politically harmless and somewhat beneficial to life." He peddles and praises these "harmless and beneficial" works everywhere, claiming they can satisfy the needs of the masses like "side dishes."

    Chairman Mao taught us as early as twenty-four years ago: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." There are only two kinds of politics in the world—one is the proletariat, and the other is the bourgeoisie. Literature and art that serve a certain class's politics can only belong to either the proletariat or the bourgeoisie. Literary works either express the politics of the proletariat or the politics of the bourgeoisie; they are either beneficial to the politics of the proletariat or beneficial to the politics of the bourgeoisie. There are no works that "do not express political content" or are "politically harmless and beneficial to life"!

    "Knowledgeability," "entertainment value," and "recreational value" are the slogans of "Zhou's Side Dishes." The "knowledgeability" that Zhou Yang advocates is the kind found in works like Deng Tuo's *Yanshan Night Talks*. What kind of knowledge do they spread? Clearly, under the guise of telling stories and imparting knowledge, they shoot arrow after arrow of anti-party and anti-socialist poison at the proletariat! The "entertainment value" and "recreational value" that Zhou Yang praises are the reactionary tastes found in works like *Recruiting Soldiers*, *Fan of Football*, and *Big Li, Little Li, and Old Li*, which defame workers, peasants, and soldiers. These are the vulgar and lowbrow tastes of the bourgeoisie! These poisonous weeds can only be enjoyed and entertained by the bourgeoisie; they cannot make the proletariat "relaxed and happy." We feel nauseated when we see these things and must eradicate them!

    Once the label of "Zhou's Side Dishes" is torn off, Zhou Yang's malicious intentions become crystal clear. What he calls "politically harmless" is a smokescreen laid by Zhou Yang. They wrap their black goods in colorful packaging and coat bullets with sugar to launch attacks, poisoning people unknowingly! What he calls "somewhat beneficial to life" is just a trick played by Zhou Yang. He dreams of breaking into our lives through this "opening," using the decadent and corrupt lifestyle of the bourgeoisie to corrupt the proletariat, using a "soft knife" to kill, making you unaware of the pain and blood, "comfortably" and "lightheartedly" being peacefully evolved by them. Zhou Yang's theory of "harmless and beneficial" is a revolutionary theory that is highly harmful to the proletariat and highly beneficial to the bourgeoisie. Zhou Yang's "this nature" and "that nature" are the class nature of the bourgeoisie! Zhou Yang's "side dishes" are "corrosive goods" aimed at peacefully evolving our proletariat! They are "sugar-coated bullets" intended to blow up our proletariat! We must not be deceived!

    “副食品”——腐蚀品
    副班长　吴润生
    周扬说文艺可以分为“有益、无害、有害几种情况”。所谓“无害有益”，用他的话来说，就是“不表现政治内容”，“政治上无害，生活上还有点益处”的作品。他到处兜售、吹嘘这些“无害有益”的作品可以跟“副食品一样，满足群众的需要”。
    毛主席早在二十四年前就教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”世界上的政治只有两家——无产阶级一家，资产阶级一家。为一定阶级的政治服务的文学艺术，也只能分属于无产阶级和资产阶级两家。文艺作品不是表现无产阶级的政治，就是表现资产阶级的政治，决没有“不表现政治内容”的东西；不是有利于无产阶级的政治，就是有利于资产阶级的政治，决没有“政治上无害，生活上有益”的东西！
    “知识性”、“趣味性”、“娱乐性”是“周记副食品”的招牌。周扬鼓吹的“知识性”，就是邓拓之流的《燕山夜话》这些货色。他们传的是什么知识？分明是在讲故事、传知识的幌子下，射向无产阶级的一支又一支反党反社会主义的毒箭！周扬吹嘘的“趣味性”、“娱乐性”，就是《抓壮丁》《球迷》《大李小李和老李》这些丑化工农兵的反动趣味，就是资产阶级的逗笑、调情这些庸俗不堪的低级趣味！这些毒草，只能供资产阶级去“欣赏”，去“娱乐”，决不能使无产阶级“轻松愉快”，我们见了这些东西就会恶心，就要把它铲除！
    撕下“周记副食品”的招牌，周扬的恶毒用心就清清楚楚了。所谓“政治上无害”，是周扬布迷魂阵。他们给黑货加上彩色的包装，用糖衣裹着炮弹进攻，使人在不知不觉之中受到毒害！所谓“生活上还有点益处”，不过是周扬耍的一个花招。他梦想从我们的生活上打开“突破口”，用资产阶级腐朽糜烂的生活情调来腐蚀无产阶级，用“软刀子”杀人，叫你不觉疼、不见血，“舒舒服服”、“轻松愉快”地被他们和平演变过去。周扬的“无害有益”论，是大有害于无产阶级，大有益于资产阶级的反革命理论。周扬的这个“性”，那个“性”，就是资产阶级的阶级性！周记“副食品”，是和平演变我们无产阶级的“腐蚀品”！是想炸垮我们无产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”！我们千万不要上当！
