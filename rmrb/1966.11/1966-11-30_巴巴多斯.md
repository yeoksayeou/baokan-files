Barbados is an island nation in Latin America, located at the easternmost end of the West Indies in the Caribbean Sea. The entire island covers an area of 431 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 250,000 people. Barbados was originally inhabited by Indians and Caribs. In 1624, it became a British colony. For over three hundred years, this island nation has been under British colonial rule. Barbados has fertile land and abundant resources, but under Britain's long-term colonial rule, it has developed a single-economy structure centered around sugarcane production. The people live in poverty, and essentials like rice and other necessities have to be imported.

Where there is oppression and exploitation, there is bound to be resistance. The people of Barbados have bravely fought against colonial rule. In 1876, Barbados saw a black uprising. In 1937, the people of Barbados rebelled again, demanding the end of colonial rule. After the dissolution of the "West Indies Federation," a tool of British neocolonialism in Latin America, in 1962, the movement for independence in Barbados surged. Under these circumstances, Britain had no choice but to agree to Barbados's independence.

    巴巴多斯
    巴巴多斯是拉丁美洲的一个岛国，位于加勒比海西印度群岛的最东端。全岛面积四百三十一平方公里，居民约二十五万人。巴巴多斯原是印第安人和加勒比人集居的地区，一六二四年沦为英国殖民地。三百多年来，这个岛国一直处在英国殖民统治之下。巴巴多斯土地肥沃，物产丰富，但在英国的长期殖民统治下，形成了生产甘蔗为主的单一经济。人民生活贫困，大米和其它生活必需品都要靠进口。
    有压迫和剥削，必然有反抗，巴巴多斯人民为了反对殖民统治，不断进行了英勇的斗争。一八七六年，巴巴多斯爆发了黑人暴动。一九三七年，巴巴多斯人民再次起义，要求取消殖民统治。一九六二年英国在拉美进行新殖民主义统治的工具“西印度联邦”瓦解后，巴巴多斯人民要求独立的运动更加高涨。在这种形势下，英国不得不同意巴巴多斯独立。
