    二十多个省市区的革命小将在杭州学习蔡永祥的集会上提出倡议
    无限热爱毛主席　无限忠于毛泽东思想
    搞好革命大串连，在步行串连中熟悉社会，了解阶级斗争，向工农学习；向解放军学习，大兴三八作风，遵守三大纪律八项注意；时刻保持高度革命警惕性。
    据新华社杭州二十一日电　从全国二十几个省、市、自治区到杭州进行革命串连的红卫兵和革命师生一千多人，怀着无比崇敬的心情，在十七日集会，向一心为公的共产主义战士蔡永祥学习。会上，大家一致表示要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想；并且向全国红卫兵和革命师生提出了四项革命倡议。
    这次集会是由来杭州进行革命串连的江西吉安第二中学、安徽歙县中学等十一个学校的红卫兵发起，得到二百多所学校红卫兵和革命师生的支持而举行的。
    乘坐七六四次红卫兵专车的江西吉安第二中学红卫兵代表吴继烈，和来自北京、陕西、安徽、上海的红卫兵代表，以及由北京、四川、云南、辽宁、吉林、贵州六个省、市七所中学的红卫兵组成的“红军长征队”的代表，分别在会上讲了话。他们纷纷表示，要学习蔡永祥生为革命战斗，死为革命献身的一心为公的共产主义精神。
    大会在热烈的掌声中，通过了给全国红卫兵和革命师生的倡议书。倡议书上说，为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把全国办成毛泽东思想大学校，把我们培养成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，我们倡议：一、像蔡永祥同志那样无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想。毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是我们的指路明灯。我们要以蔡永祥同志为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作；把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，在灵魂深处闹革命。我们要像蔡永祥同志那样坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决批判资产阶级反动路线。为了捍卫毛泽东思想，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯。二、搞好革命大串连。在步行串连中领会毛主席的正确路线，熟悉社会，了解阶级斗争，向工农群众学习，磨炼革命意志，永远跟着毛主席，做一辈子革命人，走一辈子革命路，要走得人人心红骨头硬。三、要向解放军学习，大兴三八作风，遵守三大纪律八项注意。我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，像解放军那样有高度的政治觉悟和高度的组织性纪律性，模范地执行党和国家的政策，发扬艰苦朴素的优良传统，切实遵照毛主席的教导，在任何地方，必须十分爱惜人力物力，爱护国家财产，保护群众的利益，遵守交通规则和公共秩序。四、要像蔡永祥同志那样对阶级斗争时刻保持高度革命警惕性，保守国家机密，随时注意防止坏人破坏。
