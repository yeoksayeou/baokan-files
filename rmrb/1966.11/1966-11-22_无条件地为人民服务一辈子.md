	Serve the People Unconditionally for Life
	Electrician Cao Hengchang

	In order to learn electrical skills and gain others' praise, I used my spare time to help people repair radios. Because of this selfish motive, not only did I fail to repair the radios, but I also damaged them. I then studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind. In his essay "On Coalition Government," Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everything should be done from the perspective of the people's interests, not from the perspective of personal or small group interests." I repaired radios only to gain others' praise, which is exactly acting from personal interests. Therefore, I followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "selflessly serving others" and considered helping others repair radios as my duty. From then on, I often used my rest time to repair radios and clocks for others. I think this is also serving the people, and I will be a lifelong volunteer repairman for the revolution.

    无条件地为人民服务一辈子
    电工　曹恒昌
    我为了学电工技术和得到别人好评，就在业余时间帮助大家修理收音机。由于有这种私心杂念，不但没修好收音机，反而把人家的收音机给弄坏了。我就带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席在《论联合政府》一文里教导我们： “一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。我修收音机只想得到别人的表扬，这不正是从个人的利益出发吗？于是我遵循毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，把帮助大家修理收音机当作自己份内的事。以后，我就经常利用休息时间给大家修理收音机，还给大家修闹钟。我想，这也是为人民服务，我要为革命作一辈子义务修理员。
