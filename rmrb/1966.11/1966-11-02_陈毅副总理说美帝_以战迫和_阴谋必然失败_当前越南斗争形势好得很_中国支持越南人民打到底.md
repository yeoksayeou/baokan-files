Vice Premier Chen Yi said tonight: The current situation of the struggle in Vietnam is very good, and it is getting better and better. U.S. President Johnson recently convened the so-called Manila "Seven-Nation Summit," playing up the plot of "forcing peace through war" on the Vietnam issue, which is bound to suffer a thorough failure.

Vice Premier Chen Yi made these remarks at the national day reception held by the Algerian Ambassador to China tonight.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly U.S. imperialism, is the task of all the people of the world." The current situation of the struggle in Vietnam and the struggle of all the people of the world against U.S. imperialism is very good, and it is getting better and better.

He said, U.S. President Johnson recently personally took charge, running around and convening the so-called Manila "Seven-Nation Summit," playing up the plot of "forcing peace through war" on the Vietnam issue. Modern revisionists and various followers of U.S. imperialism are also very active, doing their utmost to serve U.S. imperialism. It can be said for sure that all these dirty activities will absolutely not save U.S. imperialism from its inevitable failure.

He said, Prince Sihanouk recently also exposed that the Manila meeting aims to make the Vietnamese people give up their independence, sovereignty, and unity. Recently, General de Gaulle also condemned the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, believing that U.S. troops must withdraw from Vietnam. Vice Premier Chen Yi said, to solve the Vietnam issue, U.S. aggressors must unconditionally and immediately withdraw all their troops from South Vietnam.

Vice Premier Chen Yi stressed, as long as the U.S. aggressors do not withdraw, the Vietnamese people will only fight hard, fight to the end! The Chinese people and all the revolutionary people of the world stand firmly on the side of the Vietnamese people, supporting the Vietnamese people to fight to the end! Vietnam will surely win, and the U.S. empire will surely fail!

    陈毅副总理说美帝“以战迫和”阴谋必然失败
    当前越南斗争形势好得很  中国支持越南人民打到底
    新华社一日讯　陈毅副总理今晚指出：当前越南的斗争形势好得很，而且越来越好。美国总统约翰逊最近召开所谓马尼拉“七国首脑会议”，在越南问题上大搞“以战迫和”的阴谋，必然要遭到彻底的失败。
    陈毅副总理是在阿尔及利亚驻中国大使今晚举行的国庆招待会上讲这些话的。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，毛主席指出：“结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务。”当前越南的斗争形势和全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争形势，好得很，而且越来越好。
    他说，美国总统约翰逊最近亲自出马，东奔西跑召开了所谓马尼拉“七国首脑会议”，在越南问题上大搞“以战迫和”的阴谋。现代修正主义者和美帝国主义的形形色色的追随者，也大肆活动，竭力为美帝国主义者效劳。可以肯定，所有这些肮脏活动，绝对挽救不了美帝国主义必然失败的命运。
    他说，西哈努克亲王最近也揭露了马尼拉会议是要越南人民放弃独立主权和统一。最近戴高乐将军也谴责美国侵略了越南，认为美国军队必须从越南撤出。陈毅副总理说，要解决越南问题，美国侵略者就必须无条件地立即全部从越南南方撤出去。
    陈毅副总理强调说，美国侵略者不走，越南人民就只有狠打，打到底！中国人民和全世界革命人民坚决站在越南人民一边，支持越南人民打到底！越南必胜，美帝必败！
