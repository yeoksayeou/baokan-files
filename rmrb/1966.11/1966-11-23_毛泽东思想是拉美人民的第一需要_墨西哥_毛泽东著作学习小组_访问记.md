"Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time, Chairman Mao's theories are the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest and most precious treasure of the world's proletariat." This was the first sentence spoken by the leader of the "Mao Zedong Works Study Group" in Mexico City when they received us, enthusiastically praising the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

More than two years ago, in the capital of Mexico, Mexico City, some workers, young teachers, and progressive intellectuals organized the "Mao Zedong Works Study Group" in search of revolutionary truth. Over the past two years, this group has seriously studied and discussed Chairman Mao's works on philosophy, revolution, and party-building theories, as well as his theories on people's war. Although they encountered various difficulties during their studies, they gained more confidence and saw more clearly the future of the Latin American people.

Recently, we visited the leader of this study group, who spoke to us about the group members' deep affection and respect for Chairman Mao and his works. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a theory developed through revolutionary practice and, in turn, guides revolutionary practice, thus achieving victory in the revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth, and Mao Zedong's theories are as clear and transparent as the most brilliant pearls. Every statement and every conclusion resonate with our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is indeed contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and all revolutionaries must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. For Latin Americans, this should be the first necessity of life."

This Mexican friend said that although U.S. imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries are colluding and using various nefarious means to prevent the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Latin America, truth cannot be suppressed. He said, "We Latin American people affectionately call Mao Zedong our leader and our teacher. His theories on politics, economics, military affairs, culture, and all other aspects are our guides to action."

This leader of the study group comes from a poor peasant family in the mountains of Mexico. His speech was simple and straightforward, with the purity of a peasant. He said that only after reading Chairman Mao's works did he find the way to solve the peasant problem. He believes that Chairman Mao's works are profound yet easy to understand, clear and illuminating, like a torch lighting the way for revolutionaries.

He then introduced to us the situation of other members of the study group learning Chairman Mao's works. He said, "Our group members all love Mao Zedong's works. We believe that Chairman Mao is our contemporary Lenin." He firmly said, "We believe that China is the vanguard in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and Beijing has become the center of world revolution."

This Mexican friend also specially introduced to us their understanding of Chairman Mao's theories on party-building, surrounding the cities from the countryside, revolutionary bases, united front, and people's war. He said, "These theories guided the Chinese revolution to victory. Why shouldn't these theories apply to Latin America? Lenin once said, 'Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement.' In the 1960s, we can confidently say that without Mao Zedong's revolutionary theory, there would be no correct guidelines to lead the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to victory against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and to build independent, free, and democratic nations."

He emphasized, "All peoples who want to break free from imperialist slavery should learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the truth, and Chairman Mao is the teacher of all peoples." He said that Chairman Mao called on the peoples of all countries to organize anti-imperialist united fronts to resolutely fight against the world's number one and most vicious enemy, U.S. imperialism. This is an inspiration to the world's peoples. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have already given and are giving heavy blows to imperialism, especially the Vietnamese people's patriotic struggle against U.S. aggression is the most resolute and heroic struggle. The fate of U.S. imperialism is doomed to failure. He said, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "U.S. imperialism's hands are too long. Every place it invades, it puts a new noose around its own neck. It has already fallen into the encirclement of the peoples of the whole world."

When talking about the Cultural Revolution currently underway in China, this Mexican friend said it is an "unprecedented revolution of the proletariat." He stressed, "Today this revolution has touched the souls of the Chinese people, and in the future, it will touch the souls of all peoples of the world. All ghosts and monsters opposing communism are facing death. People's war and the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat will surely put the imperialist demons to death. In all these aspects, China has set the example of raising the highest, reddest, and greatest flag in the world."

He enthusiastically conveyed to us the greetings from all members of the study group to Chairman Mao. They wish Chairman Mao eternal life and wish socialist China to forever stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and they are glad that the world's revolutionary peoples have such a vanguard.

Finally, a member of the study group read to us a poem he dedicated to Chairman Mao:

	Ah! Chairman Mao Zedong, revolutionary people follow you,
	Because you are the helmsman of the sea voyage,
	You are the savior of the people,
	You are the glory of our era,
	You are the eternal victory!

	In the face of the red sun in the East, the old world trembles.
	Ah! Mao Zedong, we follow you,
	Yes! Following you, we will be victorious.
	Long live victorious China!
	Long live the contemporary Lenin!

    毛泽东思想是拉美人民的第一需要
    ——墨西哥“毛泽东著作学习小组”访问记
    “毛主席是当代的列宁，毛主席的理论是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，毛泽东思想是世界无产阶级最巨大、最珍贵的财富。”这是墨西哥城“毛泽东著作学习小组”负责人接见我们时，热情赞扬中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的第一句话。
    两年多以前，在墨西哥首都墨西哥城，一些工人、青年教师和进步知识分子为了寻求革命的真理，组织了“毛泽东著作学习小组”。两年多以来，这个小组认真地学习和讨论了毛主席有关哲学、革命和建党理论以及关于人民战争学说的著作。在学习过程中，虽然他们碰到了这样或那样的困难，但是他们越学越有信心，越学越看清了拉丁美洲人民的前途。
    不久前，我们访问了这个学习小组的负责人，他对我们谈了小组成员对毛主席和毛主席著作的深厚感情和对毛主席的敬意。他说：“毛泽东思想是在革命实践中发展起来的理论，又反过来指导革命实践，从而使革命取得胜利。毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理，毛泽东的理论就像最晶莹的明珠一样清澈透明，它的每一段论述，每一个论断都扣动了我们的心弦。毛泽东思想确实是当代的马克思列宁主义，所有革命者都必须学习毛泽东思想，运用毛泽东思想，对拉丁美洲人来说，这应该成为生活的第一需要。”
    这位墨西哥朋友说，尽管美帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派勾结在一起，狼狈为奸，使用种种不可告人的手段来阻止毛泽东思想在拉丁美洲的传播，但是真理是封锁不住的。他说：“我们拉丁美洲人民亲切地把毛泽东称为我们的领袖，我们的导师，他的关于政治、经济、军事、文化等方面的全部理论，都是指导我们行动的指南。”
    这位学习小组的负责人出身于墨西哥山区的一个贫苦农民家庭，他的谈话富有农民的淳朴、坦率的气质。他说，他只是在读了毛主席著作之后，才找到了解决农民问题的途径。他认为，毛主席著作深入浅出，明确透彻，好像火炬一样照亮了革命者前进的道路。
    随后，他向我们介绍了这个学习小组其他成员学习毛主席著作的情况。他说：“我们小组的成员都热爱毛泽东著作，我们认为，毛主席是我们当代的列宁。”他坚定有力地说：“我们认为，中国是反对帝国主义和反对修正主义斗争的先锋队，北京已成为世界革命的领导中心”。
    这位墨西哥朋友还特别向我们介绍了他们学习毛主席关于建党、关于农村包围城市、关于革命根据地、关于统一战线和人民战争的理论的体会，他说：“这些理论指导中国革命，使得中国人民取得了胜利。这些理论，难道对拉丁美洲就不适用吗？列宁曾经说过，‘没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。’在二十世纪六十年代，我们可以肯定地说，没有毛泽东的革命理论，就没有正确的方针来引导亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争，引导他们去取得反对美帝国主义及其走狗的胜利和建立独立、自由和民主的国家。”
    他强调说：“所有那些希望摆脱帝国主义奴役的人民，都应该学习和运用毛泽东思想，毛泽东思想是真理，毛主席是各国人民的导师。”他说，毛主席号召各国人民组织反帝统一阵线，以便同世界上头号和最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义展开坚决斗争，这是对世界人民的鼓舞。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲已经给予和正在给予帝国主义以沉重的打击，特别是越南人民反抗美国侵略的爱国斗争是最坚决、最英勇的斗争，美帝国主义的命运是注定要失败的。他说，正如毛主席所指出：“美帝国主义的手伸得太长了。它每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。它已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。”
    在谈到中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命的时候，这位墨西哥朋友说，这是“无产阶级的史无前例的革命”。他强调说：“今天这场革命已触及了中国人民的灵魂，今后它必将触及全世界人民的灵魂。反对共产主义的一切牛鬼蛇神，已经面临死亡了。人民战争和无产阶级文化大革命，必将置帝国主义妖魔于死地。在所有这些方面，中国立下了在全世界举起最大最红最高的旗帜的功勋。”
    他热情洋溢地向我们转达了学习小组全体成员对毛主席的祝颂。他们祝毛主席万寿无疆，祝社会主义中国永远英勇地站在反对帝国主义和反对修正主义斗争的前线，并且为全世界革命人民有像中国这样的先锋队而庆幸。
    最后，学习小组的一位成员，向我们朗读了他献给毛主席的一首诗：啊！毛泽东主席，革命人民都跟着你，因为你是大海航行的舵
  手，你是人民的救星，你是我们时代的光荣，你是永恒的胜利！在东方的红太阳面前，旧世界在发抖战慄。啊！毛泽东，我们跟着你
  呵！跟着你，我们就胜利。万岁！胜利的中国！万岁！当代的列宁！
