Three years ago on November 18, the great communist warrior Ouyang Hai sacrificed himself to save a train. This year, during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another hero in the style of Ouyang Hai appeared—Cai Yongxiang. To rescue the Red Guards' train, to protect the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, and to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he bravely sacrificed his young life!

Just as Ouyang Hai pushed away the charging horse in front of the approaching train, Cai Yongxiang, at the critical moment of life and death, fearlessly and without hesitation, rushed towards the train and struggled to lift the large log placed on the tracks by the class enemy. What force drove him to do this? It was a shining "public" character.

This "public" character is the communist worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people and dedicating everything to the revolution.

Cai Yongxiang's heroic deed fully demonstrated the power, greatness, and radiance of the "public" character!

Where does this "public" character come from? It comes from Mao Zedong Thought. Only revolutionaries who arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought can establish this "public" character, grasp this "public" character, and truly dedicate themselves to the "public." Cai Yongxiang once said: "I am like a child learning to walk. Chairman Mao holds my hand, leads me, and teaches me to walk the revolutionary path." "Chairman Mao's works shine with golden light, illuminating the hearts of the soldiers." It is the great Mao Zedong Thought that "illuminates the hearts of the soldiers," nurturing Cai Yongxiang into a communist warrior who wholeheartedly serves the public.

Cai Yongxiang is very young, only eighteen years old. On the long revolutionary journey, he is indeed a "child learning to walk"; but he quickly learned to "walk the revolutionary path" and rapidly grew into a communist warrior.

What is the reason for this? His diary provides the answer.

In Chairman Mao's works, Cai Yongxiang learned the most from the "Three Constantly Read Articles." He used the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a weapon to constantly revolutionize his soul and establish the public in his mind. In this revolution, first, he set high standards for himself; second, he adopted a full-steam-ahead attitude towards ideological transformation. High standards mean completely and thoroughly using Chairman Mao's teachings as the standard to demand of himself, truly doing as Chairman Mao says, without any discount or negligence. In ideological transformation, adopting a full-steam-ahead attitude means having the spirit of "seizing the day," learning Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely implementing them, breaking down the "private" and establishing the "public," step by step transforming himself, truly achieving "immediate results."

This is the path of Cai Yongxiang's growth, and it is also the path of growth for Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and countless young heroes! We should learn from Chairman Mao's good soldier Cai Yongxiang, learn from the heroes emerging in the army, and like them, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down the private and establish the public, and become people who wholeheartedly serve the public.

    “公”字的光辉
    任颂
    三年前的十一月十八日，伟大的共产主义战士欧阳海舍身救列车。今年，在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，又出现了一个欧阳海式的英雄战士——蔡永祥。为了抢救红卫兵列车，为了保住钱塘江大桥，为了捍卫无产阶级文化大革命，他英勇地献出了自己年青的生命！
    像欧阳海在冲来的列车面前推开战马一样，蔡永祥在生死关头，毫无畏惧，毫不犹豫，迎着列车，冲上前去，奋力抱起阶级敌人横置在火车轨道上的大木头。是什么力量促使他这么干的？是一个金光闪闪的“公”字。
    这个“公”字，就是一心为人民，一切为革命的共产主义世界观。
    蔡永祥的英雄行为，充分地显示了“公”字的力量，“公”字的伟大，“公”字的光辉！
    这个“公”字从何而来？从毛泽东思想来。用毛泽东思想武装自己头脑的革命战士，才能树立这个“公”字，才能掌握这个“公”字，才能做到一心为“公”。蔡永祥这样说过：“我像一个学走路的孩子，是毛主席扶着我，领着我，教会我走革命的路”，“毛主席著作闪金光，照得战士心里亮”。正是伟大的毛泽东思想，“照得战士心里亮”，把蔡永祥哺育成为一个一心为公的共产主义战士。
    蔡永祥年纪很轻，才十八岁，在革命的长途上，他确实还是一个“学走路的孩子”；但是，他很快地学会了“走革命的路”，迅速地成长为一个共产主义战士。
    这又是什么道理呢？他的日记为我们提供了答案。
    在毛主席著作中，蔡永祥学得最多的是“老三篇”。他以“老三篇”为武器，不断地在自己的灵魂深处闹革命，在自己的头脑里破私立公。在这个革命中，第一，他以高标准要求自己；第二，他对思想革命化采取鼓足干劲的态度。高标准，就是“完全”、“彻底”地以毛主席的教导为标准来要求自己，真正做到“毛主席怎么说的，我就怎么做”，一点也不打折扣，半点也不肯马虎。在思想革命化上鼓足干劲，就是有“只争朝夕”的精神，学了毛主席的指示，就下决心用，狠破“私”，大立“公”，“一步一个脚印”地改造自己，真正作到了“立竿见影”。
    这是蔡永祥成长的道路，也是雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊成长的道路，千千万万个青年英雄成长的道路！我们要向毛主席的好战士蔡永祥同志学习，向解放军中出现的英雄人物学习，像他们那样活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，作一个一心为公的人。
