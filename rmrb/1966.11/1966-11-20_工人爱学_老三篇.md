Workers love to study the "Three Articles."
Zhang Zedong is a good example,
"Completely" and "thoroughly" for the people,
Revolutionary spirit to the end is firm.

Workers love to study the "Three Articles."
The spirit of Norman Bethune is in their hearts,
Swear to be communists,
Firmly throw away the "I."

Workers love to study the "Three Articles."
Spirit is high and will is firm,
The spirit of the "Old Man Moving Mountains" is greatly promoted,
Dare to change the sky and the earth.

    工人爱学“老三篇”
    周意训工人爱学“老三篇”，张思德是好榜样，“完全”、“彻底”为人民，革命到底意志坚。工人爱学“老三篇”，白求恩精神记心间，誓做共产主义者，“我”字坚决抛一边。工人爱学“老三篇”，意气风发斗志坚，“愚公”精神大发扬，敢教日月换新天。
