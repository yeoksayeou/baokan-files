The Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a reception on November 14 to see off a delegation led by S. N. Senanayake, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, as they embarked on a tour of several Afro-Asian countries. The delegation was wished success in their mission to enhance the fighting friendship between the peoples of Afro-Asia and to strengthen the anti-imperialist unity among Afro-Asian writers.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and S. N. Senanayake both spoke at the reception.

In his speech, Guo Moruo condemned U.S. imperialism for expanding its aggression worldwide and denounced the Soviet revisionists for plotting to convene a fake third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to sabotage the Afro-Asian writers' movement and serve U.S. imperialism. He said that to defeat imperialism, one must also defeat revisionism. Both imperialism and modern revisionism must be fought head-on.

Guo Moruo praised the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, led by S. N. Senanayake, for issuing a series of statements on major international issues recently, engaging in a head-on struggle with Soviet splitists. He said this showed that the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau was a genuine leadership core reflecting the anti-imperialist revolutionary demands of Afro-Asian writers and peoples. The unity of the anti-imperialist Afro-Asian writers' movement in its struggle against the counter-revolutionary line advocated by the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique has grown stronger than ever before.

Guo Moruo said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led personally by Chairman Mao, which is now proceeding victoriously in our country, is a great and epoch-making event in the history of Marxism. This revolution will have a profound and far-reaching impact on China's culture, politics, and economy, and will also have a profound and far-reaching impact on the culture, politics, and economy of Asia, Africa, and even the entire world.

Senanayake said, "Chairman Mao Zedong once said to foreign friends: 'Friends can be true or false, but through practice, one can tell who is a true friend and who is a false friend.' Our delegation's mission in visiting Afro-Asian countries is to consolidate the understanding and unity between true friends, to enhance the fighting unity of Afro-Asian writers and peoples in opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States. This is the true unity against imperialism and colonialism."

Senanayake said that the struggle between the fighting and progressive line of Afro-Asian writers and peoples and the capitulationist and counter-revolutionary line of Soviet revisionists has entered a new stage. It is our inescapable responsibility to unite the writers and masses of the two continents, to thoroughly expose, isolate, and smash the capitulationist line of the Soviet revisionists.

After reaffirming the Bureau's firm stance on some major international issues, Senanayake condemned the preparatory meeting for the fake third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference being held in Cairo, which was plotted by Soviet revisionists. He said that the convening of this meeting violated the resolutions and decisions passed at previous Afro-Asian writers' conferences, large and small. We declare this meeting illegal, and everything announced at this meeting is invalid.

Invited to attend the reception were representatives from member countries of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, some foreign representatives in Beijing who participated in the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers, members of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association led by Q. C. Chaudhuri, and representatives of some international organizations in Beijing.

Also present were various responsible officials, including Liao Chengzhi, Chu Tunan, Ding Xilin, and Yu Ji.

    增进亚非反帝反殖团结　粉碎苏修投降主义路线
    文联欢送森纳那亚克率代表团访亚非国家
    郭沫若和森纳那亚克讲话，谴责苏修策划召开亚非作家伪三大分裂会议
    新华社十四日讯　中国文学艺术界联合会主任郭沫若今天下午举行招待会，欢送亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克率领亚非作家常设局友好代表团访问一些亚非国家，祝代表团对增进亚非人民的战斗友谊，加强亚非作家的反帝团结，作出新的贡献。
    郭沫若和森纳那亚克在招待会上讲话。
    郭沫若在讲话中谴责美帝国主义在世界各国扩大侵略，谴责苏联修正主义者策划召开亚非作家伪三大，破坏亚非作家运动，为美帝国主义效劳。他说，要打倒帝国主义，必须同时打倒修正主义。对于帝国主义和现代修正主义都必须作针锋相对的斗争。
    郭沫若赞扬以森纳那亚克为首的亚非作家常设局，最近针对重大国际问题发表了一系列声明，同苏联分裂主义者进行了针锋相对的斗争，深刻地揭露了美帝国主义及其走狗帮凶的种种罪行。他说，这表明亚非作家常设局是反映亚非作家和人民反帝革命要求的一个真正的领导核心，团结反帝的亚非作家运动在和苏联现代修正主义领导集团倡导的反革命路线的斗争中得到发展，比以前的任何时候都更强大。
    郭沫若说，毛主席亲自领导的正在胜利进行的我国无产阶级文化大革命，是关系我国前途和命运的大事，也是关系世界革命的前途和命运的大事，是马克思主义发展史上的一个划时代的大事。这场大革命对于中国的文化、政治、经济将发生伟大的深远的影响，对于亚洲非洲以至全世界的文化、政治、经济也必将发生伟大而深远的影响。
    森纳那亚克说，毛泽东主席在接见外国朋友时曾经谈到：“朋友有真假，但通过实践可以看清谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友。”我们代表团访问亚非国家的使命就是要巩固真正朋友之间的了解和团结，为了增进亚非作家和亚非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的战斗团结。这种团结是反帝反殖的真正团结。
    森纳那亚克说，亚非作家和人民战斗的、进步的路线与苏联修正主义者的投降的、反革命的路线之间的斗争已经进入了一个新的阶段。团结亚非两大洲作家和群众，彻底揭露、孤立和粉碎苏联修正主义者的投降主义路线，已经成为我们不可推卸的责任。
    森纳那亚克重申了常设局对当前一些重大国际问题的坚定立场以后，谴责了苏联修正主义者策划的正在开罗进行的筹备亚非作家伪三大的分裂会议。他说，这个会议的召开是违反亚非作家历次大小会议所通过的决议和决定的。我们宣布这次会议是非法的，在这个会议上所宣布的一切东西都是无效的。
    应邀出席招待会的，有亚非作家常设局成员国代表，参加亚非作家紧急会议的一些在北京的外国代表，以查禾多为首的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处成员，以及一些国际组织的在京代表。
    出席招待会的，还有各有关方面负责人廖承志、楚图南、丁西林、虞棘等。
