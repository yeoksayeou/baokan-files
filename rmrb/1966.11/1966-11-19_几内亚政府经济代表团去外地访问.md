Guinean Government Economic Delegation Visits Other Places

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, Guinean Minister of Economic Development Ismail Touré and the Guinean Republic government economic delegation led by him departed Beijing by special plane today to visit Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places.

Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian of the State Council, as well as more than a thousand people from the capital, went to the airport to give them a warm send-off.

Today, the national flags of China and Guinea fluttered in the wind at the capital airport. As the Guinean guests bid farewell to the welcoming crowd, people held up signs with quotations from Chairman Mao, waved copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and waved bouquets and ribbons, repeatedly shouting slogans such as "Long live China-Guinea friendship," "Long live the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa," "Long live the unity of all the peoples of the world," and "Down with American imperialism and old and new colonialism."

    几内亚政府经济代表团去外地访问
    据新华社十八日讯　几内亚政府经济发展部部长伊斯梅尔·杜尔和由他率领的几内亚共和国政府经济代表团今天乘专机离开北京，去广州、上海等地参观访问。
    国务院副总理陈毅、李先念，以及首都群众一千多人前往机场热烈欢送。
    今天，首都机场上中几两国国旗迎风招展。当几内亚客人向欢送的群众告别时，人们高举着毛主席语录牌，挥动着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，挥舞着花束和彩带，不断高呼“中国—几内亚人民友好万岁”、“亚非人民大团结万岁”、“全世界人民大团结万岁”、“打倒美帝国主义和新老殖民主义”等口号。
