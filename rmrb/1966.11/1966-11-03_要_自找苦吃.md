The phrase "seek hardship" is often used by some mediocre individuals as a derogatory term to mock those so-called "fools" who do not know how to enjoy happiness. However, in the eyes of a revolutionary, "seek hardship" is an important experience in the ideological transformation of revolutionary cadres, a revolutionary spirit and style worthy of great praise.

One praises while the other condemns, reflecting two fundamentally opposed worldviews. All exploiting classes pursue personal enjoyment as the highest goal in life. For them, "seek hardship" is unimaginable. The proletarian revolution aims to eliminate all exploiting classes and systems and achieve communism. This is a great revolution. To make a revolution, one must endure hardship; to fear hardship is to be unable to make a revolution. In the eyes of the proletariat, to endure hardship for the revolution is a natural and just thing. "Seek hardship," though bitter, is sweet.

"Seek hardship" reflects a person's self-awareness in ideological transformation. In a peaceful environment, whether one can endure hardship is a major test for every revolutionary cadre, especially for leading cadres. Comrade Hao Zhongyun has personally experienced this: "Enduring hardship is not a small matter, but a big matter that strengthens proletarian feelings, prevents peaceful evolution, and maintains fighting spirit." Recognizing this, he is very self-aware and proactive in his ideological transformation, always actively seeking hardship, even in small matters of life, strictly demanding of himself, and always maintaining the demeanor of an ordinary soldier.

"Seek hardship" is an attitude of active offense in ideological struggle. Chairman Mao said: "Offense is the main means of annihilating the enemy." Against ideological enemies, if you do not attack them, they will attack you. Only by using the "Three Articles" as weapons and continuously launching attacks on thoughts of seeking comfort, fearing hardship, and avoiding hardship, can one eliminate bourgeois ideology in its infancy, avoid suffering greatly in the future, and always maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit, becoming a thorough revolutionary.

### 要“自找苦吃”

    要“自找苦吃”
    立影
    “自找苦吃”这句话，常常被一些庸人当作贬词，用来嘲笑那些所谓“有福不会享”的“蠢人”。然而，在一个革命者看来，“自找苦吃”，却是革命干部改造思想的一条重要经验，是一种值得大大赞扬的革命精神、革命作风。
    一褒一贬，反映了两种根本对立的世界观。一切剥削阶级都是以追求个人享受，作为生活的最高目的。对他们来说，“自找苦吃”完全是不可想像的事。无产阶级革命要消灭一切剥削阶级和剥削制度，实现共产主义。这是一场翻天覆地的革命。要革命，就要吃苦；怕吃苦，就不能革命。在无产阶级看来，为革命吃苦，这是天经地义的事。“自找苦吃”，虽苦犹甜。
    “自找苦吃”，表现了一个人思想改造的自觉性。在和平环境里，能不能吃苦，对于每个革命干部，特别是领导干部，是一个重大考验。郝忠云同志从自己亲身经历中体会到：“吃苦决不是一件小事，而是增强无产阶级感情的大事，是防止和平演变、保持战斗意志的大事。”认识到这一点，他在思想改造上就很自觉，很主动，时时处处主动找苦吃，那怕是生活上一些小事，也严格要求自己，始终保持着普通一兵的本色。
    “自找苦吃”，这是一种在思想斗争中积极进攻的态度。毛主席说：“进攻，是消灭敌人的主要手段。”对于思想上的敌人，你不攻他，他就攻你。只有用“老三篇”作武器，不断向贪图安逸、怕苦、躲苦的思想发动进攻，才能把资产阶级思想消灭在萌芽状态，避免在将来吃大苦头；才能永远保持旺盛的革命斗志，做彻底的革命派。
