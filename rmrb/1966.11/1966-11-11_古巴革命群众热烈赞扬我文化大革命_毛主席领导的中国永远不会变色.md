	Havana, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Cuban revolutionary masses warmly praise the great achievements of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, saying that this is because of the correct and firm leadership of Chairman Mao.

	A teacher said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution underway in China is of great significance." He said, "This is a struggle between the bourgeoisie attempting to restore capitalism in China and the proletariat fighting against the restoration. This is a class struggle, which is inevitable. Chairman Mao has pointed out that class and class struggle still exist in socialist society."

	A writer believes that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a struggle to eradicate revisionism in the ideological and cultural spheres. He said, "Such a cultural revolution can only be carried out in China, because China has the correct and firm leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Chinese people have a high level of political awareness and ideological level." He also said, "We are very envious of China having such a firm leader as Chairman Mao."

	Another teacher said, "I am fully convinced that China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, will never change color and will not produce capitalist restoration and become revisionist like some countries." He also said, "The Cultural Revolution is opposed by the enemy, which shows that China is doing the right thing. If it were praised by imperialism, it would mean that China has problems. I believe that the Chinese people are not afraid of any enemy's insults, and the Chinese people have long anticipated this."

	A worker believes that all true socialist countries should carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has already achieved great victories, because the Chinese people have used Mao Zedong Thought to counter the plot of capitalist restoration."

    古巴革命群众热烈赞扬我文化大革命
    毛主席领导的中国永远不会变色
    新华社讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴革命群众热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的巨大成就，认为这是因为有毛主席的正确和坚强领导。
    一位教员说：“正在中国进行的无产阶级文化大革命具有伟大的意义”。他说：“这是一场资产阶级分子企图在中国复辟资本主义和无产阶级进行反复辟的斗争。这是一场阶级斗争，是不可避免的。毛主席指出过，在社会主义社会仍然存在着阶级和阶级斗争。”
    一位作家认为中国无产阶级文化大革命是在思想文化领域内根除修正主义的斗争。他说：“这样的文化大革命只有在中国才能进行，因为中国有毛泽东主席正确和坚强的领导，中国人民具有高度的政治觉悟和思想水平。”他还说：“我们十分羡慕中国有毛主席这样坚强的领导”。
    另一位教员说：“我完全相信，中国在毛主席的领导下永远不会变色，不会像有些国家那样产生资本主义复辟，变成修正主义。”他还说：“文化大革命遭到敌人反对，这是因为中国做得对。假如受到帝国主义赞扬，那就说明中国有问题了。我相信中国人民是不怕任何敌人辱骂的，中国人民也早预料到了这一点。”
    一位工人认为，真正的社会主义国家都应该进行无产阶级文化大革命。他说：中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的胜利，这是因为中国人民运用了毛泽东思想，反击了资本主义复辟的阴谋。
