The heroic people of Albania, with hearts full of joy and inspiration, are celebrating the 22nd anniversary of their liberation in the midst of a revolutionary high tide.

Since March this year, under the leadership of the Party of Labour of Albania and the government, the Albanian people have launched a vigorous revolutionization movement to prevent the restoration of capitalism and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. A new revolutionary atmosphere has emerged across the country.

	Leaders Go to the Grassroots to Strengthen Ties with the Masses

	The Party and government of Albania have taken measures to streamline organizations and dispatch Party and government cadres to grassroots levels to eliminate bureaucracy. The central government's 19 departments have been merged into 13, reducing the number of staff by half. The number of staff in district-level government agencies has been reduced by 10%. The leadership structures of various state-owned enterprises have also been streamlined, reducing the number of non-production personnel. Based on this streamlining, many Party and government leaders have been sent to grassroots levels and production frontlines to work. The cadres who have been sent down have gone deep into the masses and played a model role in production, receiving enthusiastic praise from the people. In Albania, wage gaps are already small, but the Party and government have decided to reduce the salaries of high-level cadres while keeping general wages unchanged. This has a significant effect on strengthening the connection between leaders and the masses and preventing the emergence of revisionism.

	Strengthening Military Political Work to Carry Forward Revolutionary Traditions

	To further enhance the political and ideological awareness of the military, carry forward revolutionary traditions, and strengthen the military's combat effectiveness, the Party Central Committee has decided to re-establish political commissars, establish Party committees, and abolish the rank system in the military. These revolutionary measures have greatly inspired all officers and soldiers. The soldiers' enthusiasm for military training and labor is high. Under the slogan of "treating the training ground as a battlefield," they are diligently practicing close combat, night combat, and hand-to-hand combat skills, achieving excellent results in military training. At the same time, the entire army is engaged in large-scale agricultural production, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in food, vegetables, and meat as soon as possible.

	Under the call of the Party of Labour, the entire army has launched a "Model Platoon" movement. Good political and ideological work is the first condition for a "Model Platoon." The entire army has also launched movements for "Model Squads," "One Helps One," and "Model Youth Organizations."

	Strongly Supporting Agriculture to Strengthen the Worker-Peasant Alliance

	To vigorously develop agricultural production and strive for grain self-sufficiency, workers from all sectors across the country have responded to the Party's call and launched a wave of strong support for agriculture. They have launched intense labor competitions, producing a large number of agricultural machinery and irrigation equipment to meet the needs of large-scale terracing, land reclamation, and water conservancy projects in rural areas. Factories, mines, and enterprises across the country have also launched a "One Helps One" movement, pairing one factory with one agricultural cooperative to help repair agricultural machinery and irrigation equipment, and dispatching workers to help cooperatives during busy agricultural seasons.

	Workers and cadres have also extensively carried out voluntary labor to support industry for agriculture and cities for the countryside. A large number of workers and cadres have settled in rural areas. Through strong support for agriculture, the ideological revolutionization of workers has been promoted, further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance.

	Strengthening Ideological Education to Cultivate Revolutionary Successors

	The Party of Labour has taken various measures to strengthen the political and ideological education of youth, cultivating them into loyal successors to Marxism-Leninism and the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	The Party calls on youth to study the history of the Party and the speeches of Comrade Enver Hoxha, as well as the history and documents of the Communist Party of China. It educates youth to view all issues with a political perspective and conducts class education, inviting old workers and peasants to share their sufferings and oppression in the old society with the youth. The Party also strengthens the revolutionary tradition education for youth, inviting old guerrillas to introduce the heroic struggles and sacrifices of the older generation of revolutionaries for the country's liberation. The Party also regards participating in physical labor as one of the basic requirements for the revolutionization of youth. Through these educations, the political and ideological awareness of youth has been greatly improved.

	The revolutionary measures taken by the Party of Labour of Albania will not only greatly advance Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction but also enrich the experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Chinese people warmly applaud the great achievements of the Albanian people in the revolutionization movement and sincerely wish them greater victories.

    阿尔巴尼亚在革命化大道上奋勇前进
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，以欢欣鼓舞的心情，在革命化的高潮中，庆祝解放二十二周年。
    今年三月份以来，阿尔巴尼亚人民为了防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府领导下，在全国掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的革命化运动，出现了一派革命的新气象。
  领导干部下放　密切联系群众
    阿尔巴尼亚党和政府为了清除官僚主义，采取了精简机构和派党政干部到基层工作的措施。中央政府的十九个部合并成十三个部，工作人员减少了一半。区级政府机关工作人员也减少了百分之十。各个国营企业的领导机构也缩减了一部分非生产人员。在精简机构的基础上，党派了许多党政领导干部到基层、到生产第一线去工作。下放的干部深入群众，在生产中起模范带头作用，得到群众的热烈赞扬。在阿尔巴尼亚，本来工资差距就不大，但是，党和政府还是决定，在一般工资不变的原则下，降低高级干部的工资。这对加强领导和群众的联系，防止出现修正主义有很大作用。加强军队政治工作　发扬革命传统
    为了进一步提高军队的政治思想觉悟，发扬革命传统，加强军队的战斗力，党中央决定在军队中重新设立政治委员，建立党委会和取消军衔制。这些革命化措施大大鼓舞了全体指战员。战士们参加军事训练和劳动的热情都很高涨。他们在“把练兵场当成战场”的口号下，苦练近战、夜战、肉搏战的杀敌本领，在军事训练中取得了优秀成绩。同时，全军还大搞农业生产，争取早日实现军队的粮食、蔬菜和肉食自给。
    在劳动党的号召下，全军普遍开展了“模范连队”运动。政治思想工作好是“模范连队”的第一个条件。全军还开展了“模范分队”、“一帮一”、“模范青年组织”等运动。
  大力支援农业　加强工农联盟
    为了大力发展农业生产，争取实现粮食自给，全国各行各业的职工，响应党的号召，掀起了大力支援农业的热潮。他们展开了紧张的劳动竞赛，增产了大量的农业机械和灌溉设备，以满足广大农村大修梯田、开荒和兴修水利的需要。全国各厂矿企业还开展了“一帮一”运动，一个工厂同一个农业合作社挂钩，帮助修理农业机器、灌溉设备，在农忙时抽调工人帮助合作社劳动。
    广大职工和干部还广泛开展了工业支援农业、城市支援农村的义务劳动。大批工人和干部到农村安家落户。通过大力支援农业，促进了职工的思想革命化，进一步加强了工农联盟。加强思想教育　培养革命接班人
    劳动党采取各种措施，加强对青年的政治思想教育，把青年培养成忠于马列主义和无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    党号召青年学习党史和霍查同志的讲话以及中国共产党的历史和文件，教育青年用政治的眼光来看待一切问题，并对青年进行阶级教育，请老工人、老农民给青年讲他们在旧社会遭受的苦难和压迫。党还加强对青年的革命传统教育，请老游击队员介绍老一代革命者为祖国解放事业英勇战斗、流血牺牲的事迹。党还把参加体力劳动作为青年革命化的基本要求之一。通过这些教育，使青年政治思想觉悟有了很大提高。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所采取的这些革命化措施，不但将大大推进阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，而且将丰富无产阶级专政的经验。中国人民热烈欢呼阿尔巴尼亚人民在革命化运动中取得的伟大成就，并且衷心祝贺他们取得更大的胜利。
