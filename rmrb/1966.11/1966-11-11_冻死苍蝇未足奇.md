Title: The Freezing of Flies is Nothing to Be Surprised About

In the spring of 1957, when the bourgeois right-wing elements were stirring, Zhou Yang gleefully declared, "In the past, it was severe cold; now it has thawed." He also shouted, "Although it has thawed, dogmatism and sectarianism are still severe, and it is estimated that the current period is still in a state of 'spring chill.' The truly warm and blooming period has not yet arrived."

The "thaw" that Zhou Yang repeatedly shouted about is nothing new. The notorious revisionist reactionary writer Ilya Ehrenburg wrote a novel called "The Thaw," which attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat and praised Khrushchev's revisionism. Khrushchev praised it to the skies. In their view, the dictatorship of the proletariat is "bitter cold in the third lunar month," "ice-covered land," not only without their "freedom," but almost frozen stiff. After Khrushchev's conspiracy to seize power, he dragged socialist Soviet Union onto the revisionist path. This group of counter-revolutionary revisionists were overjoyed, saying this was a "thaw," a "beautiful spring" of "potato stew with beef." The "thaw" that Zhou Yang and his ilk talk about is in the same vein as Khrushchev's revisionist "thaw," singing the same tune.

This counter-revolutionary revisionist, Zhou Yang, in order to realize his dream of "thawing," to serve the restoration of capitalism, he carried out a "thaw" conspiracy in the literary and artistic circles, deliberately distorting Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." He vigorously advocated and promoted bourgeois liberalization, making the literary and artistic circles chaotic. This is the "spring" that Zhou Yang and his ilk talk about.

There can only be one spring. If there is their bourgeois "spring," there will be no proletarian spring. Zhou Yang's "spring" can only bring cold, darkness, and deep suffering to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must shout at Zhou Yang and his ilk:

The "freeze" of the proletarian dictatorship over all class enemies, you will never be able to "thaw" it for ten thousand years!

Your "spring" will never come!

We, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, will be as cold and ruthless as severe winter towards those ghostly and snake-like demons who are anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. We will use "rolling cold currents" and "snowstorms" to freeze them so that they have no place to hide! If minus fifty degrees is not enough, we will make it minus one hundred degrees. "The freezing of flies is nothing to be surprised about," we must freeze and kill all the harmful black flies completely, thoroughly, and utterly! We must let the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shine upon the earth, and let the spring of the proletariat forever flourish on earth!

    冻死苍蝇未足奇
    故事员　徐芝祥
    一九五七年春天，正当资产阶级右派分子蠢蠢欲动的时候，周扬兴高采烈地宣称，“过去是严寒，现在解冻了”。他还叫喊，“虽然已经解冻，但教条主义和宗派主义还很厉害，估计目前还处于‘春寒’状态，真正的春暖花开的时期还没有到来。”
    周扬口口声声叫嚷的所谓“解冻”，并不是什么新鲜货色。臭名远扬的修正主义反动作家爱伦堡，曾经写了一本攻击无产阶级专政，吹捧赫鲁晓夫修正主义的小说《解冻》，被赫鲁晓夫捧上九重天。在他们看来，无产阶级专政是“三九严寒”，“冰封大地”，非但没有他们的“自由”，差一点儿要把他们冻僵。赫鲁晓夫阴谋篡夺了政权以后，把社会主义的苏联拉到修正主义的道路上去了。这伙反革命修正主义分子兴高采烈，说这是“解冻”，是“土豆烧牛肉”的“美好春天”。周扬之流所说的“解冻”，和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的所谓“解冻”一脉相承，异曲同工。
    周扬这个反革命修正主义分子，为了实现他的“解冻”的梦想，为复辟资本主义效劳，他在文艺界大搞“解冻”阴谋，肆意歪曲毛主席提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针。卖力地鼓吹和推行资产阶级自由化，把文艺界搞得乌烟瘴气。这就是周扬一伙所谓的“春天”。
    春天只能有一个。有了他们资产阶级的“春天”，就没有我们无产阶级的春天。周扬的这个“春天”，只能给我们广大劳动人民带来严寒、黑暗和深重的苦难。我们要向周扬之流大喝一声：
    无产阶级对一切阶级敌人专政的“冻”，你们千年万载永远也“解”不开！
    你们的“春天”永远不会到来！
    我们广大工农兵对那些反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的牛鬼蛇神，就是要像严冬那样冷酷无情，要用“滚滚寒流”和“漫天雪”把他们冻得毫无藏身之地！零下五十度不行，就给它零下一百度。“冻死苍蝇未足奇”，一定要把那些害人的黑苍蝇全部、干净、彻底地冻僵、冻死！一定要让毛泽东思想的阳光普照大地，让无产阶级的春天永葆人间！
