Every Word and Sentence is Truth

Deputy Political Instructor Wang Jianshi of a certain unit in the People's Liberation Army

At the beginning of this year, I was serving as the secretary of the company. As the training was about to begin, I noticed that some comrades in the platoon had torn shoes, and it was inconvenient for them to get them repaired outside. So, I bought a set of shoe repair tools and leather, intending to go to the platoon to repair the shoes for the comrades. Before I went down, an idea flashed through my mind: The entire company has so many people, buying leather would cost a lot of money. Could I charge according to the cost? I shared this idea with the leadership, but the leadership did not support my suggestion. I felt very unhappy about this. That night, I studied the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and dedication to the people is manifested in his extreme sense of responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." I have studied this passage many times, but it has never felt as close to my heart as it did today. I thought repeatedly: Why did Chairman Mao use the word "毫" here, and why did he place "毫不利己" before "专门利人"? I felt that there was a lot of meaning in this.

"毫" is a very small unit of measurement. Chairman Mao's "毫不利己" means that we should not have even a single strand of selfishness. Chairman Mao placed "毫不利己" before "专门利人" to tell us that only by not thinking of ourselves at all can we truly serve others. If there is even a hint of selfishness, even a strand of individualism, one cannot truly serve others. Going to the platoon to repair shoes for comrades is a good deed, but before going down, I was already worried about spending my own money and about losing out. Can this be called "毫不利己专门利人"? I examined my thoughts and eliminated this selfish idea. I discarded the idea of charging and, together with a few other comrades, planned to use the holiday to go to each platoon and repair all the shoes that needed fixing, which was welcomed and praised by the comrades.

Later, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" over and over again. I discovered that Chairman Mao used the word "毫" three times in this article: "毫无利己的动机," "毫不利己专门利人," and "毫无自私自利之心." I thought: Why did Chairman Mao emphasize this word "毫" so much? The more I thought about it, the more I felt that this word "毫" was of great significance and profound meaning. Chairman Mao used these three "毫" words to summarize Norman Bethune's selfless and revolutionary spirit. Chairman Mao called on us to learn from Norman Bethune, which means to learn from his selfless and revolutionary spirit; it means to use the highest standard to transform our thoughts and thoroughly eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness.

From then on, I used these three "毫" words as my standard for eliminating selfishness and combating individualism. Every time I did something, I would think: Is it "毫无利己的动机"? Every night, I would check: Was I "毫不利己专门利人" and "毫无自私自利之心" today? In this way, I received Chairman Mao's teachings every day and used Chairman Mao's instructions to examine myself every day. As soon as any selfish thoughts appeared, they were immediately exposed and had no place to hide. One day, while helping the commune pull wheat, I thought on my way back: Today, I have been doing the heaviest work and doing it ahead of others, so there shouldn't be any problems, right! But when I used the "毫无自私自利之心" as the highest standard microscope to examine myself, I found that there was still selfishness at work. For example, during labor, some comrades dropped too much wheat. At first, I said a few words, but then I thought that since I was not the team leader, why bother with other people's business, so I did not interfere. Isn't this selfishness at work? I checked these thoughts and thought about the wheat dropped in the field, feeling that my selfishness was not thoroughly eliminated.

In July of this year, I heard that the organization was going to transfer me to the platoon to be the deputy political instructor, and I was extremely happy. I thought: The platoon trains people, the platoon produces talents. Huang Zushi, Sun Leyi, Wang Daoming, and others, aren't they all from the platoon? As soon as this thought appeared, I asked myself: Am I going to the platoon to learn and propagate Mao Zedong Thought better, to undergo better tempering, and to work for the Party? Or am I going to the platoon to become famous throughout the army? Using Chairman Mao's three phrases "毫无利己的动机," "毫不利己专门利人," and "毫无自私自利之心" to examine myself, I felt my face burning. Is this thought a coincidence? No. Thinking carefully, it has very deep roots in my thoughts. Just take my diary as an example. Over the years, I have written many diaries, all recording what good deeds I did that day, and rarely recording my shortcomings. Doing good deeds is the result of reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words, which should be attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao, but why record it in my own account? With this idea, every page I write adds a bit of selfishness, and if I keep writing like this, selfishness will become heavier and heavier. Through study, I was greatly shocked in my thoughts. From then on, I changed my diary to a "thought account," as a record of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and transforming my thoughts. I also wrote my wrong thoughts on the first page to constantly alert myself. And I reviewed the past more than ten diaries page by page, tearing out all the pages that recorded good deeds. I felt that what I tore out was not just a few pages of the diary, but the dirtiest and most shameful things in the depths of my soul.

    字字句句是真理
    解放军某部副指导员　王建世
    今年年初，我在营部当书记。部队快开始训练时，我看到连里有的同志鞋子破了，到外边补不方便，便买了一套修鞋工具和皮子，准备下连给同志们修鞋。还没下去，脑子里就闪出一个念头：全营那么多人，买皮子得花不少钱，能不能按成本收费呢？我把这个打算告诉了领导，领导上没有支持我的意见，我心里很不痛快。晚上，我学习了《纪念白求恩》这篇文章。毛主席说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”毛主席的这段话，我曾经学习过许多次，可是从来没有今天这样感到亲切。我反复想：毛主席为什么在这里用了一个“毫”字，而且把“毫不利己”放在“专门利人”的前边？我觉得这里面大有道理。
  “毫”是非常小的数量单位。毛主席说的“毫不利己”，就是要求我们连一根头发丝那么大的个人主义思想都不可有。毛主席把“毫不利己”放在“专门利人”的前边，是告诉我们，只有丝毫不为自己打算，才能专门利人。有半点私心，有头发丝那么大的个人主义的人，就不能专门利人。我下连为同志们补鞋，这是件好事，可是还没下去，就怕花自己的钱，怕自己吃亏。这能说是“毫不利己专门利人”吗？我从思想上清算了这种私心杂念，打消了收费的想法，和其他几个同志一起商量好，利用假日，到各连队把同志们要修补的鞋子都修补了一遍，受到了同志们的欢迎和赞扬。
    以后，我又一遍一遍地学习了《纪念白求恩》一文。发觉毛主席在这篇文章里一连用了三个“毫”字——“毫无利己的动机”，“毫不利己专门利人”，“毫无自私自利之心”。我想：毛主席为什么如此强调这个“毫”字？越想越感到这个“毫”字的意义重大，含义深刻。毛主席用这三个“毫”字，集中地概括了白求恩同志一心为公，一心为革命的光辉思想。毛主席号召我们学习白求恩，就是要学习他这种一心为公，一心为革命的共产主义精神；就是要求我们用最高标准，改造自己的思想，彻底地破“私”立“公”。
    从此，我就以这三个“毫”字作为自己扫私心、斗“我”字的标准。每做一件事都想一想：是不是“毫无利己的动机”，每天晚上都检查一下，这一天是不是“毫不利己专门利人”，“毫无自私自利之心”？这样，天天接受毛主席的教导，天天用毛主席的指示来检查自己，私心杂念一露头就能及时被揪出来，使它没有藏身之地。有一天，帮助公社拔麦子，晚上回来时，我想：今天我一直在拣重活干，而且干在别人前头，该说没有什么问题了吧！但是，拿起“毫无自私自利之心”这个最大度数的显微镜来透视一下，发觉还是有私心在作怪。譬如劳动的时候，有的同志拔麦子丢的太多，起初我还说几句，后来认为反正不是我带队，何必多管闲事，就不去过问了。这不是私心在作怪吗？我检查出这些，再想想地里丢的那些麦子，就感到自己的私心还破得很不彻底。
    今年七月份，我听说组织上要调我到连队去当副指导员，心里高兴极了。心想：连队锻炼人，连队出人材，黄祖示、孙乐义、王道明等同志不都是从连队出来的吗？这个想法一露头，我便问自己：我是为了到连队像黄祖示、孙乐义、王道明他们那样更好地学习、宣传毛泽东思想，更好地经受锻炼，为党工作呢？还是为了到连队能闻名全军呢？用毛主席提出的“毫无利己的动机”、“毫不利己专门利人”和“毫无自私自利之心”三句话一检查，脸上觉得热辣辣的。这种思想是偶然出现的吗？不是。细细想来，它有着很深的思想根源。就拿我记日记来说，几年来，我记了不少日记，记的都是那一天做了什么好事，很少记缺点。做好事，这是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话的结果，本来应该归功于伟大的领袖毛主席，为什么偏要记在自己的账上呢？抱着这个想法记日记，记一页就多一分私心，长期记下去，私心就会越来越重。通过学习，我思想上受到很大震动。从此以后，我把日记本改为“思想账”，作为活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想的纪实。我还把自己的错误思想记在第一页上，经常警惕自己。并且逐页审查了过去记的十多本日记，把那些记着做好事的全部撕下来。我觉着撕下来的不是几页日记，而是自己灵魂深处最肮脏最可耻的东西。
