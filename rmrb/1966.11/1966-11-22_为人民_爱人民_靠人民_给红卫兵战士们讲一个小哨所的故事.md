Red Guards, in this great proletarian cultural revolution, you are fearless, daring to wield the mighty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to smash the old world to pieces. Your revolutionary actions are excellent! We salute you and express our respect! We pledge to be your steadfast supporters.

Chairman Mao says: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." He also says: "The army must become one with the people. Only then can it be invincible." Your actions in the proletarian cultural revolution, where you share the same breath and fate with the people, remind me of our army's glorious tradition of being for the people, loving the people, and relying on the people. Here, I will tell you a story about a small outpost of our garrison troops.

This outpost consists of only five people, living in a remote fishing village with just eight households. The soldiers studied Chairman Mao's works and understood that doing mass work is an important political task for our army, a glorious tradition. They were determined to carry on and pass down this tradition.

The soldiers treated the people's difficulties as their own. Soon after they arrived in the village, they saw that the people had great difficulty getting water. So, they got up early and worked late, climbing mountains and crossing valleys to fetch sweet water from several miles away and deliver it to every household, regardless of wind or rain. Later, they helped the people dig two deep wells, fundamentally solving the village's water problem.

The soldiers often risked their lives to protect the people's lives and property. One day, a strong wind of seven or eight levels blew, and a large part of the roof of Wei Grandma's house was blown away, threatening to collapse. Deputy Squad Leader Wang Changgui immediately climbed onto the roof and used his body to press down the roof tiles. A gust of wind blew him off the roof, and he fainted. After regaining consciousness, despite his injuries and the people's dissuasion, he braved the wind again and, together with the other soldiers, saved Wei Grandma's house.

The soldiers often guided the people in studying Chairman Mao's works and propagated Mao Zedong Thought. In their daily lives, they were always eager to serve the people. For example, during windy and rainy days, they helped the people close doors and windows, secure the roof tiles, bring in firewood from outside, and pull the small fishing boats ashore. When someone fell ill, they helped send them to the hospital for treatment. In this way, the soldiers' hearts grew closer to the people, and their class feelings deepened. The people affectionately called the outpost the "ninth household of our village." The people treated the outpost's affairs as their own and the soldiers' difficulties as their own, which greatly promoted the further implementation of military-civilian cooperation and preparedness work.

The soldiers of this outpost deeply felt that in the past war years, our army used its life to protect the people's interests, and the people used their lives to support our army's battles. Today, we must also protect the people's interests and do mass work well, "making the army seen as their own by the people." Only then will the people truly support and love us from the bottom of their hearts and give us their full support. This is an important source of our army's strength and an important guarantee for our victories.

Red Guards, having you as our reserve force, we feel honored and proud. Let us, under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, unite more closely with the broad masses of the people, and push the proletarian cultural revolution to greater victories!

    为人民　爱人民　靠人民
    ——给红卫兵战士们讲一个小哨所的故事
    解放军某守岛部队副部队长　陈武魁
    红卫兵小将们，在这次伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，你们天不怕，地不怕，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把旧世界砸得稀巴烂。你们的革命行动好得很！我们向你们欢呼，向你们致敬！我们誓做你们的坚强后盾。
    毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”又说：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。你们在无产阶级文化大革命中和人民群众同呼吸共命运的实际行动，使我想起了我们军队为人民、爱人民、靠人民的光荣传统。这里，我给你们讲一讲我们守岛部队一个小哨所的故事。
    这个哨所一共只有五个人，他们住在一个只有八户人家的偏僻渔村里。战士们学习了毛主席著作，认识到做群众工作是我军一项重要的政治任务，是我军的光荣传统，他们决心把这个光荣传统接过来、传下去。
    战士们把群众的困难当作他们自己的困难。他们进村不久，看到群众吃水特别困难，就起早贪黑，翻山越岭，到几里地以外去担来甜水，送到各家各户，刮风下雨也从不间断。以后，他们又帮助群众打了两眼很深的井，从根本上解决了这个村子吃水用水的问题。
    战士们常常不顾自身安危，保护群众生命财产的安全。一天，刮起了七八级大风，魏大娘家的房草被风掀掉了一大片，眼看房子有倒塌的危险。副班长王长贵立即爬上房顶，用身子压住房草。一阵大风把他从房上掀下来，摔昏了过去。他苏醒以后，不顾身上的伤疼和人们的劝阻，又顶风上房，终于和战士们一起保住了魏大娘的房子。
    战士们经常辅导群众学习毛主席著作，向群众宣传毛泽东思想。平时，都热心为群众服务。例如，在刮风下雨的时候，帮助群众关好门窗，压好房草，把外面的柴禾抱回来，把海边的小渔船拉上岸；群众有人得了急病，他们就帮助送到医院救治……。就这样，战士们和群众的心越贴越紧，阶级感情越结越深，群众亲切地称哨所是“我们村里的第九户”。群众把哨所的事情也当成自己的事情，把战士们的困难当成自己的困难，这就大大促进了军民联防和战备等工作的进一步落实。
    这个哨所的战士们深深体会到：在过去的战争年代里，我们军队用生命保护人民利益，人民也用生命支援我们军队作战；今天，我们也只有处处维护群众利益，做好群众工作，“使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队”，群众才会从心眼里真正拥护、爱戴我们，全力支援我们。这是我军力量的重要源泉，是我军取得胜利的重要保证。
    红卫兵小将们，有你们这样的后备军，我们感到光荣和自豪。让我们在伟大领袖毛主席英明领导下，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，和广大人民群众进一步团结在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命推向更大的胜利！
