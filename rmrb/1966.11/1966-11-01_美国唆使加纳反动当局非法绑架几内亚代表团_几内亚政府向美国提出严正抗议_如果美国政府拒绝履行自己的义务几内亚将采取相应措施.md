The United States incites the reactionary government of Ghana to illegally kidnap the Guinean delegation. The Guinean government lodges a strong protest with the United States. If the United States government refuses to fulfill its obligations, Guinea will take corresponding measures.

According to the New China News Agency in Conakry on the 30th, the Political Bureau of the Guinean Democratic Party and the Guinean government strongly condemned the reactionary government of Ghana for illegally kidnapping the Guinean delegation, which was passing through Accra, the capital of Ghana, with the connivance of the United States government. The delegation, led by Guinean Foreign Minister Lansana, was on its way to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to attend the ministerial council meeting of the Organization of African Unity scheduled to open on the 31st, aboard a Pan American World Airways plane.

According to a broadcast by Conakry Radio, after learning that the Guinean delegation had been illegally kidnapped in Accra on the 29th, the Political Bureau of the Guinean Democratic Party and the Guinean government held a special meeting on the morning of the 30th. A communiqué issued after the meeting said: "The Guinean government declares that the United States government is fully responsible for the illegal and premeditated actions of the Accra authorities."

The communiqué said that the government of the Republic of Guinea has lodged a strongly indignant protest with the United States government.

The communiqué said: "The Guinean government demands that the United States government, through Pan American World Airways, fulfill its obligations and ensure by all means that the Guinean delegation is transported to Addis Ababa before the ministerial council meeting of the Organization of African Unity is held."

The communiqué said: "If, by the expiration of this deadline, the Guinean government finds that the United States government refuses to fulfill its obligations, the Republic of Guinea, its people, and its government will take all corresponding measures against the United States government."

The Political Bureau of the Guinean Democratic Party and the Guinean government issued a second communiqué on the 30th, calling on all levels of the Guinean Democratic Party to hold demonstrations and marches on November 1st to counter the illegal kidnapping of the Guinean delegation by the Accra authorities, to show the unity and determination of the Guinean people in defending the dignity of the nation.

    据新华社科纳克里三十日电　几内亚民主党全国政治局和几内亚政府，今天强烈谴责加纳反动当局在美国政府的纵容下非法绑架路过加纳首都阿克拉的几内亚代表团。这个由几内亚外交部长朗萨纳率领的代表团是乘泛美航空公司的飞机前往埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴参加预定于三十一日开幕的非洲统一组织部长理事会会议的。
    据科纳克里电台广播，几内亚民主党全国政治局和几内亚政府在获悉几内亚代表团于二十九日在阿克拉被非法绑架后，在三十日上午举行特别会议。会后发表一项公报说：“几内亚政府宣布，美国政府要对阿克拉当局所犯下的这种非法的和预谋的行动，承担全部责任。”
    公报说，几内亚共和国政府向美国政府提出深感愤慨的抗议。
    公报说：“几内亚政府要求美国政府通过泛美航空公司履行自己的义务，并保证通过一切办法在非洲统一组织部长理事会会议举行之前，把几内亚代表团运到亚的斯亚贝巴。”
    公报说：“在这一期限到期时，如果几内亚政府发现美国政府拒绝履行自己的义务，几内亚共和国、它的人民和政府将对美国政府采取一切相应的措施。”
    几内亚民主党全国政治局和几内亚政府三十日发表第二个公报，号召几内亚民主党各级组织在十一月一日举行示威游行，反击阿克拉当局非法绑架几内亚代表团，以表示几内亚人民的团结一致和保卫国家尊严的坚强的意志。
