Chairman Mao said: "Small communes have few people, little land, and little capital, and cannot engage in large-scale operations or use machinery. Such small communes still shackle the development of productive forces and cannot remain for too long; they should be gradually merged."

Chairman Mao's words illuminated the path forward for the people of the Chaoyang Commune in Lianyungang City.

Ten years ago, the mountains here were barren, the water was foul, and half of the land was infertile saline-alkali soil. Over the past ten years, the people of Chaoyang have relied on the advantages of large communes and the collective strength of over three thousand pairs of iron shoulders and iron hands to plant trees, build forests, construct dikes, and build dams. They have transformed the mountains, the water, and the saline-alkali soil here, making 11,000 out of the commune's 14,000 mu of arable land achieve initial drought and flood resistance. They have increased the average yield per mu from 270 jin to 701 jin. They have gone from being slaves to nature to masters who transform nature.

In 1956, the advanced cooperative was established. The commune decided to build a reservoir in the valley of Yuntai Mountain. As soon as the news spread, rumors began to circulate: "Poverty is fate, wealth depends on heaven, to live a good life you still have to rely on the Three Officials." Some landlords even secretly incited, "To build a reservoir, you'll disturb the dragon's lair and break the feng shui, it will bring disaster." Some backward-thinking commune members were unsure what to do, and some went to the commune cadres saying, "It's better to stop, after all, there's the Communist Party, we won't starve to death."

What to do? The Party organization led everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works, raising the awareness of the broad masses of commune members and exposing the enemy's plots. A passage from Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" about dispelling superstitions made everyone see clearly. How could one believe in the superiority of large communes and collective power, yet believe in the "Three Officials," the "dragon's lair," and "feng shui"? Thus, all the commune members worked hard for twenty days and successfully built the first reservoir at the foot of Yuntai Mountain.

The first reservoir was built, but the struggle did not end there. By the end of 1957, the commune decided to build a larger reservoir with a capacity of one million cubic meters to further change the face of Chaoyang. This plan was opposed by some, who said, "Winter and spring are the time for sideline production and earning cash, building a reservoir is expensive and labor-intensive, and it also delays sideline production, it's not worth it."

The Party branch recognized that this was not just a matter of whether to build the reservoir or engage in sideline production, but a matter of whether to focus on immediate interests or consider long-term benefits. They immediately raised a question among the cadres and commune members: "Is it better to rely on sideline production to earn cash to solve immediate difficulties, or to engage in large-scale agricultural infrastructure to fundamentally change the backward face of Chaoyang?" A great discussion ensued. Su Genpei, one of the earliest members of the cooperative, said: "Chairman Mao leads us on the path of collectivization to make us rich. To change, we must plan for the long term and work hard. If we only focus on earning cash every year and do no construction, in ten or twenty years, or thirty or fifty years, won't it still be the same? When will we reach communism?" Through this discussion, everyone agreed that to change the face of Chaoyang, we must work hard and be determined to "be poor for three years to enrich Chaoyang." As a result, the reservoir started and was completed on time, creating better conditions for the development of Chaoyang.

After the bumper harvest in 1964, during the discussion on the distribution plan, another debate arose over whether to accumulate more or reserve more. That year, the income from grain and money in the third team of Yin Song increased significantly, and some proposed to distribute more grain and reserve less, and to distribute more money and accumulate less. The commune party committee immediately organized a discussion to make everyone understand that in a good year, it is appropriate to store more and accumulate more. This not only can make up for lean years but, more importantly, can create conditions for realizing long-term plans. With a unified understanding, the plan to store more and accumulate more was passed.

Over the past ten years, relying on the advantages of large communes, we have built large-scale agricultural infrastructure projects, purchased a large number of agricultural machinery, and accumulated substantial funds, preparing better material conditions to fundamentally change the face of Chaoyang.

### 亲眼看到了大社的优越性

    亲眼看到了大社的优越性
    毛主席说：“小社人少地少资金少，不能进行大规模的经营，不能使用机器。这种小社仍然束缚生产力的发展，不能停留太久，应当逐步合并。”
    毛主席的话，照亮了连云港市朝阳公社前进的道路。
    十年前，这里的山是穷山，水是恶水，地有一半是寸草不生的盐碱地。十年来，朝阳人就紧紧依靠大社的优越性，依靠组织起来的三千多双钢肩铁掌，植树、造林、修堤、筑坝，改造了这里的山，改造了这里的水，改造了这里的盐碱地，使全社一万四千亩耕地，有一万一千亩初步实现了旱涝保收，使平均二百七十斤的亩产量提高到七百零一斤。他们从听天由命的自然的奴隶，变成了改天换地的自然的主人。
    一九五六年，高级社成立了。社里决定在云台山的山窝里造一个水库。消息一传开，谣言就出笼了：“穷是命，富靠天，要过好日子还得靠三官老爷”。有的地主分子更在背后煽动说：“要造水库，捣了龙穴，破了风水，可要遭难。”一些思想落后的社员，一时拿不定主意，有的找社干部说：“还是歇手算了吧，横竖有共产党，饿不死人。”
    怎么办？党组织就领导大家反复学习毛主席著作，提高广大社员的认识，揭穿阶级敌人的阴谋。毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》中关于破除迷信的一段话，使大家豁然开朗。要信大社的优越性，信集体力量，怎么能信“三官老爷”、信“龙穴”、信“风水”呢？于是全体社员大干了二十天，就在云台山下建成了第一座水库。
    第一座水库建成了，但是，斗争并没有结束。一九五七年底，社里为了进一步改变朝阳面貌，决定再修一个蓄水一百万方的较大的水库。这个计划遭到一些人的反对，说什么“冬春正是搞副业抓现金的时候，修水库，花钱又费工，还误了副业，不合算。”
    党总支认识到，这不单单是打水库还是搞副业的问题，而是光顾眼前利益还是兼顾长远利益的问题。便立即在干部和社员中出了一个题目：“是只靠搞副业抓现钱解决一时困难，还是要大搞农田基本建设，从根子上改变朝阳的落后面貌？”展开了大讨论。最早参加合作社的贫农苏根培说：“毛主席领我们走集体化道路，就是要我们由穷变富的。要变，就要打长谱干。如果我们年年都光顾抓现钱，一点建设不搞，那十年八年，三十年五十年以后，不还是个老样子吗？哪年才能走到共产主义啊！”通过这一场讨论，大家都认为，要改变朝阳面貌，就得穷干苦干，决心“为了富朝阳，宁愿穷三年”。结果，水库按时开工，按时完成了，给朝阳发展生产创造了更好的条件。
    一九六四年丰收后，在讨论分配方案的时候，又发生了一场要不要多积累和多储备的争论。这一年，尹宋三队粮钱收入大增加，有人就提出，粮要多分少储存，钱要多分少积累。公社党委马上又组织大家讨论，使大家懂得，丰年应该适当多储存多积累的道理，这样，不仅可以以丰补歉，更重要的是可以为实现长远规划创造条件。认识统一了，多储存点多积累点的方案也就通过了。
    十年来，我们依靠大社的优越性，兴建了大规模的农田基本建设工程，添置了大批农用机械，而且积累了雄厚的资金，为彻底改变朝阳的面貌准备了更好的物质条件。
