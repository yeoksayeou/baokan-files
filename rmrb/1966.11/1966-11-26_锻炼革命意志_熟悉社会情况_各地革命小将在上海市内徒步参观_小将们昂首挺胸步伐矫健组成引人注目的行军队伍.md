On the morning of the 19th, a notable procession of over 200 revolutionary youth appeared on the streets of Shanghai. They marched with heads held high and steps firm, listening to loudspeakers introducing nearby buildings with revolutionary significance and the contrast between past and present of the streets they passed. This marching team, touring the city on foot, consisted of out-of-town Red Guards and revolutionary students from the First Medical College of Shanghai who had come to the city for revolutionary linkage.

The revolutionary youngsters' 10-hour march through the city was organized by the Red Guards and revolutionary students at the First Medical College's reception station. Along the way, they passed through some of the city's main streets and visited areas and buildings with revolutionary significance. Throughout the march, they maintained orderly ranks and high spirits.

The procession arrived at Zicaihang Road, where tree-lined avenues and wide roads made it seem like a park. The young revolutionaries learned from the introduction that this area was once a shanty town where laborers lived, known as Shanghai's "Dragon's Mustache Ditch" and "Stinky Creek." A student from Qihe Middle School in Shandong exclaimed, "Who would have thought that this place used to be a stinking creek filled with shanties?" He inquired about the whereabouts of the original shanties. Upon learning that these shanties had been relocated to newly built workers' villages, he smiled with joy.

As they passed through the magnificent People's Square in the city center, the students touring Shanghai heard about the square's past and present. This place had once been a bloodsucking tool of imperialism, where foreign invaders used horse racing and gambling to swindle the wealth created by millions of laborers; it had been a large barracks for the Japanese invaders of Shanghai and East China; it had also been a "club" for American soldiers in China to indulge in pleasure. But today, everything has changed. The dark "racecourse" has become a solemn square where the people of the entire city hold grand assemblies. A student from Anhui said that after hearing the introduction, he developed a deep revolutionary affection for every brick and stone in the square. On the square, the propaganda team of the First Medical College also conducted propaganda. Revolutionary songs, dances, and spoken performances filled with revolutionary passion stirred a strong response from the Red Guards and revolutionary students, who raised their arms and shouted slogans such as "Never forget class bitterness, remember blood debts!" "Carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!" "Long live, ten thousand times long live, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao!"

The procession then arrived at Hongkou Park, where the young revolutionaries carefully toured the Lu Xun Memorial Hall, vowing to learn from Lu Xun's revolutionary spirit of tenacity and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end upon their return.

This on-foot tour was warmly welcomed by the young revolutionaries. A student from the Inner Mongolia Agricultural Machinery School said, "The on-foot tour not only strengthened our revolutionary will but also helped us familiarize ourselves with society, the masses, and learn a lot."

    锻炼革命意志　熟悉社会情况
    各地革命小将在上海市内徒步参观
    小将们昂首挺胸步伐矫健组成引人注目的行军队伍
    十九日清晨，上海市区的街道上，出现了一支由二百多个革命青少年组成的引人注目的队伍。他们昂首挺胸，步伐矫健，一面前进，一面听着扩音喇叭介绍附近有革命意义的建筑，以及他们所经过的街道的今昔对比情况。这支正在市内徒步行军参观的队伍，就是住在上海第一医学院的来沪进行革命串连的外地红卫兵和革命师生。
    革命小将们这次历时达十小时的市内行军，是第一医学院接待站的红卫兵和革命师生发起的。他们一路上，行经了本市一些主要街道，参观了一些有革命意义的地区和建筑。在行军中，他们自始至终行列整齐，精神饱满。
    队伍来到了肇嘉浜路，这里林荫夹道，马路宽阔，仿佛是一个公园。革命小将们听了介绍，才知道过去这里原来是劳动人民聚居的棚户区，是有名的上海“龙须沟”、臭水浜。山东齐河五中一位同学激动地说：“真想不到过去这里会是棚户聚集的臭水浜。”他关心地问，原先的棚户现在都到哪里去了。当他知道这些棚户现在都已迁到新建的工人新村去居住时，他高兴地笑了。
    行经市中心区的壮观的人民广场时，来沪革命串连同学们听了对人民广场今昔对比的介绍。这里，曾经是帝国主义插到中国人民身上的一根吸血管——无恶不作的外国侵略者以赛马赌博的方式，骗取了千万劳动人民所创造出来的物质财富；这里，曾经是日寇侵略上海和华东地区的大兵营；这里，又曾经是侵华美军寻欢作乐的“俱乐部”。而今天，一切都变了，暗无天日的“跑马厅”变成为全市人民举行隆重集会的庄严的广场。安徽一个同学说，听了介绍后，对人民广场的一砖一石都产生了深厚的革命感情。在广场上，第一医学院的宣传队还进行了宣传。充满着革命激情的歌舞说唱节目，激起了红卫兵和革命师生强烈的反应，大家一齐振臂高呼：“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇！”“把文化大革命进行到底！”“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”等口号。
    队伍又来到了虹口公园，小将们仔细地参观了鲁迅纪念馆，表示回去以后一定要学习鲁迅的革命硬骨头精神，把文化大革命进行到底。
    这次步行参观受到小将们的一致欢迎。内蒙古农机学校的一位同学说：“步行参观既锻炼了革命意志，又熟悉了社会，熟悉了群众，学习到不少东西。”
