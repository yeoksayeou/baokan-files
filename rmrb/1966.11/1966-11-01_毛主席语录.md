	Quotations from Chairman Mao
	The two lines of poetry by Lu Xun, “Frowning and defying the thousand-pointed accusations, bowing and becoming the ox for the children,” should become our motto. “Thousand-pointed” here refers to the enemies. We will never yield to any vicious enemy. “Children” here refers to the proletariat and the masses of the people. All Communists, all revolutionaries, and all revolutionary literary and artistic workers should learn from Lu Xun’s example, become the “ox” for the proletariat and the masses of the people, devote oneself to the cause, and work until one’s death.

		From “Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art”

    毛主席语录
    鲁迅的两句诗，“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”，应该成为我们的座右铭。“千夫”在这里就是说敌人，对于无论什么凶恶的敌人我们决不屈服。“孺子”在这里就是说无产阶级和人民大众。一切共产党员，一切革命家，一切革命的文艺工作者，都应该学鲁迅的榜样，做无产阶级和人民大众的“牛”，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。
