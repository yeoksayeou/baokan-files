	Warning to the Vientiane Regime
	Editorial
	In recent times, the Vientiane regime in Laos has been particularly active in serving the U.S. imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas," even openly colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. At the same time, official publications of the Vientiane regime have been publishing a large number of news articles and essays attacking and slandering China's Cultural Revolution. The Vientiane regime's blatant hostility towards the Chinese people cannot but arouse the great indignation of the Chinese people.

	The Vientiane regime's anti-China activities are instigated by U.S. imperialism and serve the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression and war. Currently, U.S. imperialism and the Vientiane regime are intensifying the expansion and construction of military airfields and strategic roads in Laos, adjusting military command systems, and preparing to send U.S. aggression forces to directly attack the liberated areas of Laos. Under such circumstances, the Vientiane regime's large-scale anti-China activities are aimed at collaborating with U.S. imperialism to expand its aggression war in Indochina and intensify its criminal activities of encircling China.

	We must warn the Vientiane regime: in a situation where Laos maintains diplomatic relations with China, you are openly following the U.S. imperialists in plotting to create "two Chinas" and colluding with the Chiang bandits. This is something the Chinese people cannot tolerate. The U.S. imperialists have been frantically anti-China for many years, but they have not harmed a single hair of the Chinese people, and instead, their own situation has become worse and worse. You, following the U.S. imperialists in anti-China activities, will definitely not gain any benefits.

	Chairman Mao pointed out: "Those who are completely subservient to U.S. imperialism, in the end, can only become sacrificial offerings for U.S. imperialism." If the Vientiane regime continues to follow the U.S. imperialists down the path of anti-China activities, the outcome will be very clear.

    警告万象当局
    本报评论员
    最近一个时期，老挝万象当局十分卖力地为美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋效劳，甚至公然同蒋介石匪帮进行勾结。与此同时，万象当局的官方报刊大量刊登攻击和诬蔑中国文化大革命的新闻和文章。万象当局如此明目张胆地敌视中国人民，不能不引起中国人民极大的愤慨。
    万象当局的反华活动，是受美帝国主义指使的，是为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策效劳的。美帝国主义和万象当局目前正在老挝加紧扩建和修筑军用机场，建筑战略公路，调整军事指挥系统，为派遣美国侵略军直接进攻老挝解放区作准备。在这样的情况下，老挝万象当局大肆反华，就是为了配合美帝国主义扩大对印度支那的侵略战争和加紧包围中国的罪恶活动。
    我们要警告万象当局，在老挝同中国保持着外交关系的情况下，你们公然追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，同蒋匪帮勾勾搭搭，这是中国人民决不能允许的。美帝国主义多年来疯狂地反华，结果损害不了中国人民一根毫毛，反而使自己的处境越来越糟。你们追随美帝国主义进行反华活动，是绝对捞不到什么好处的。
    毛主席指出：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”万象当局如果还要跟着美帝国主义继续在反华的道路上走下去，最后会有什么下场，不是很明白的吗？
