In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi Province recently put into operation a pair of newly built modern large-scale mines—the Jinhuagong No. 2 Mine.

This newly operational mine pair can produce 900,000 tons of coal annually. It was designed, constructed, and equipped entirely by China itself, with a high degree of mechanization. The coal produced at the working face can be directly transported to the surface via conveyor belts and continuously loaded onto trains for external transport.

    大同煤矿新建一对大型矿井
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，山西大同煤矿最近又有一对新建的现代化大型矿井——晋华宫二号井，正式投入生产。
    这对新投产的矿井，每年可生产煤炭九十万吨。它是我国自己设计、自己施工、自己制造设备建成的，机械化程度较高。工作面生产出来的煤炭，可以经皮带运输机直接运到地面，连续装入火车外运。
