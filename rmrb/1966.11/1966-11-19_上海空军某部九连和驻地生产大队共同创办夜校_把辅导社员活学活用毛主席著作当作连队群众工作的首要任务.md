The Shanghai Air Force Unit Nine Company and the local production brigade have jointly established a night school, making the guidance of members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works the primary task of the company's mass work.

The night school has been in operation for over half a year, significantly promoting the ideological transformation of the members and the company's ideological revolutionization. Military-civilian joint defense has forged a genuine iron wall. The leadership has summarized and promoted the company's experience.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Shanghai Air Force Unit Nine Company, following Chairman Mao's great teachings that our army is both a fighting force and a working force, has, while ensuring combat readiness, made assisting poor and lower-middle peasants in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works the primary task of mass work. They have jointly established a night school with the local production brigade to study Chairman Mao's works, which has significantly promoted the ideological transformation of the broad masses of peasants and provided the company with a "large classroom" to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, promoting the company's ideological revolutionization.

Recently, the Shanghai Air Force leadership held a field meeting at the company's location to summarize and promote the experience of the company and the local production brigade in jointly establishing a night school to study Chairman Mao's works and conducting military-civilian joint study of Chairman Mao's works.

In March of this year, higher authorities designated the Nine Company and the local Hongdong Production Brigade as joint defense units. The company's party branch believed that to carry out military-civilian joint defense, it is essential to first implement ideological joint defense. Only by uniting military and civilian forces on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought can they become one, forging a genuine iron wall. After joint research with the production brigade's party branch, they decided to jointly establish a night school to study Chairman Mao's works. The news of military and civilian forces jointly establishing a night school to study Chairman Mao's works was immediately warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Militia members, youth, and even mothers in their fifties and sixties all eagerly signed up to participate, quickly forming a night school with over 240 participants.

The company's cadres and soldiers all regarded establishing a night school to study Chairman Mao's works and guiding the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works as their most important and honorable task. The company's party branch selected 17 cadres and active members in studying Chairman Mao's works to be night school instructors. They, based on the characteristics of rural residents being scattered, farm work being busy at times and idle at others, and relatively low cultural levels, frequently went to production teams for mobile instruction.

Over the past half year, the night school has held over 30 classes, repeatedly studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," and ten other articles. The company and the production brigade jointly held seven military-civilian joint study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works. Now, this night school has become a solid stronghold for studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, with peasants attending the night school regardless of wind or rain.

The process of company cadres and soldiers guiding the masses to study Chairman Mao's works is also a process of educating themselves and promoting their own ideological revolutionization. Once, Deputy Commander Hu Sicun gave a class at the night school on "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." As soon as he finished, an old poor peasant stood up and, using his personal experiences, recounted how landlords and rich peasants oppressed and exploited the poor and lower-middle peasants in the old society, each word filled with tears. Finally, he said, "Chairman Mao's words are the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We old folks cannot forget, and you young folks must listen carefully!" Hu Sicun was deeply moved and received a profound class education. While guiding the masses to study Chairman Mao's works, the soldiers also compared the vivid examples of poor and lower-middle peasants studying Chairman Mao's works, found their gaps, consciously revolutionized, and worked hard on applying Chairman Mao's thoughts. The entire company's atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works became increasingly strong.

Through jointly establishing the night school and jointly studying Chairman Mao's works, the soldiers of Nine Company and the peasants of Hongdong Production Brigade have united under Mao Zedong Thought, truly achieving "joint defense starts with united hearts," forging a genuine iron wall in both organization and ideology.

    上海空军某部九连和驻地生产大队共同创办夜校
    把辅导社员活学活用毛主席著作当作连队群众工作的首要任务
    夜校举办半年多来，有力地促进了社员思想革命化和连队思想革命化，军民联防铸成一道真正的铜墙铁壁。领导机关总结推广了这个连队的经验。
    据新华社上海电　中国人民解放军驻上海空军某部九连，遵照毛主席关于我军既是一个战斗队，又是一个工作队的伟大教导，在搞好战备的同时，把帮助贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作，当成开展群众工作的首要任务。他们和驻地的生产大队党支部共同创办了一所学习毛主席著作的夜校，有力地促进了广大社员群众的思想革命化，也使部队有了一个向贫下中农学习的“大课堂”，促进了连队的思想革命化。
    最近，驻上海空军领导机关在九连驻地召开现场会议，总结推广了这个连队和驻地生产大队共同举办学习毛主席著作夜校，开展军民同学毛主席著作活动的经验。
    今年三月，上级领导确定九连和驻地的港东生产大队为联防单位。连队党支部认为，要搞好军民联防，首先必须搞好思想联防，军民只有在毛泽东思想基础上统一起来，才能溶为一体，才能铸成一道真正的铜墙铁壁。经过他们和生产大队党支部共同研究，决定联合举办一所学习毛主席著作的夜校。军民共同举办学习毛主席著作夜校的消息一传出，立即受到广大贫下中农社员的热烈欢迎。民兵、青年，五六十岁的老妈妈，纷纷上门要求参加学习，一个有二百四十多人参加的夜校很快就成立起来。
    九连的干部和战士都把举办学习毛主席著作夜校，辅导群众活学活用毛主席著作当作自己最重要、最光荣的任务。连队党支部选派了十七个干部和学习毛主席著作的积极分子做夜校的辅导员，他们根据农村社员居住分散，农活有忙有闲，文化程度较低等特点，经常到生产队去巡回辅导。
    夜校举办半年多来，共上了三十多次课，反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《中国社会各阶级的分析》等十一篇文章，连队和生产大队还一起召开了七次军民同学毛主席著作的讲用会。现在这所夜校已经成为学习宣传毛泽东思想的巩固阵地，社员上夜校，做到了风雨不误。
    连队干部战士辅导群众学习毛主席著作的过程，也是教育自己、促进自己思想革命化的过程。有一次，副连长胡肆勤给夜校上课，讲《中国社会各阶级的分析》，刚讲完，一位老贫农就站起来，用亲身经历，给大家讲起旧社会地主富农怎样压迫剥削贫下中农，一字一泪，最后他说：“毛主席的话是我们贫下中农的命根子，我们老年人不能忘，你们青年人更要好好听！”胡肆勤听了非常激动，受到了一次深刻的阶级教育。指战员们在辅导群众学习毛主席著作过程中，还对比贫下中农学习毛主席著作的生动事例，找出差距，自觉革命，在用字上狠下功夫，整个连队学习毛主席著作的空气越来越浓。
    通过军民共同举办夜校，军民共同学习毛主席著作，九连指战员和港东生产大队的社员们，用毛泽东思想统一起来了，真正做到了“联防先联心”，从组织上、思想上铸成了一道真正的铜墙铁壁。
