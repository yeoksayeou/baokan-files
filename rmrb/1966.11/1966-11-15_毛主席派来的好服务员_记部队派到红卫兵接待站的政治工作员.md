In the cold winter nights of the capital, a student surnamed Liu sleeping at the Temple of Heaven reception station felt warmer and warmer. When it was light, he found that a military overcoat had been neatly placed over his quilt. He knew without asking that this was the work of the political workers.

Political workers are cadres and soldiers from the military who were sent to participate in the reception work. In many reception stations for revolutionary students and teachers from outside Beijing, there are such political workers. Although they come from different units, they share a common thought: the revolutionary students and teachers from outside are guests invited by Chairman Mao, and we are servicemen sent by Chairman Mao. We must bring Chairman Mao's warmth to the revolutionary students and teachers from outside.

At the Temple of Heaven reception station, as soon as it was light, while the students were still sleeping soundly, the political workers, under the morning glow, would clean the surroundings spotlessly and bring washing water and hot water to the students. At night, after the students had gone to bed, they would check each bed, help the students cover their quilts, and close the doors and windows. When female student Cui Zhenhua fell ill, the political workers were more anxious than anyone else, frequently asking about her health and bringing her water and meals. They carried the students' luggage on poles and sent batch after batch of students off, and welcomed new batches.

The students were deeply moved. Guan Yuliang from Taiyuan Normal School couldn't help asking, "Why do the PLA comrades insist on doing so many good deeds? I also want to do good deeds, but often cannot persist. Why is that?" Political worker Gui Yuzhen replied, "It's because we have studied Chairman Mao's works and listened to Chairman Mao's words!" Guan Yuliang then asked, "But how do you study Chairman Mao's works?"

To answer such questions, the reception station organized a study session to share experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. At the meeting, political worker Yan Gaoxiang, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from a certain regiment, shared his experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works with class feelings and working hard to change his worldview. Under the lamplight, the students listened and took notes attentively.

Yan Gaoxiang's sharing greatly inspired the students. They said, "The PLA comrades study Chairman Mao's works well because they have deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works." But why do the PLA have such deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works? A student raised this question.

The students' strong desire for progress also deeply moved the political workers. To make the students' life at the reception station more meaningful, they decided to invite political worker Zhang Xingwang, who had suffered greatly, to tell his family history.

That night, after the students finished their day of sightseeing, they sat around the electric light, quietly listening to Zhang Xingwang recalling his family's bitter history. Zhang Xingwang's grandfather was taken away by the Japanese devils to work as a laborer and died under the bayonets of the fascist bandits. His father owed a high-interest loan to the landlord. One night, the landlord called his father and forced him to hand over the few caves his family had. On his way back, he was killed by the Japanese devils. National hatred and class resentment illuminated Zhang Xingwang's eyes. Zhang Xingwang excitedly told everyone: Chairman Mao is our great savior, Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We must read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words. To practice Chairman Mao's teachings, I am willing to shed my blood and life!

The bitter history meeting ended, but the revolutionary students' hearts could not calm down for a long time. They discussed in groups of threes and fours. Some said, "Now I understand, the PLA comrades have such deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works because they never forget their class sufferings and have the clearest hatred." Others said, "We should learn from the PLA and study Chairman Mao's works with strong class feelings like the PLA."

A series of politically meaningful activities greatly educated the revolutionary students. The students' enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works increased. They voluntarily organized study groups, spending two to three hours each day studying with questions, and many insisted on writing study notes every day.

The students, taking the political workers as examples, learned and applied what they learned, and the spirit of communism flourished. Every morning, they would take the brooms and buckets from the political workers, rushing to clean the environment and bring washing water. When some students fell ill, they would take turns guarding by the bed, carefully taking care of them.

On November 11, our great leader Chairman Mao received the revolutionary students and teachers from outside who came to Beijing for revolutionary linkage. Twenty-three students from Taiyuan Normal School, with happy hearts, were about to leave Beijing. The political workers helped the students carry their bags all the way to the train station. In just a few days, the revolutionary students and the political workers had built deep class feelings. At the moment of separation, many students were reluctant to part, shedding tears of excitement. Many students said, "A few days of shared life made us realize that the PLA is indeed worthy of our learning. After we go back, we must, like the PLA, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. We must, like the PLA, emphasize politics, carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, and make ourselves reliable reserves for the PLA."

### “毛主席派来的好服务员”——记部队派到红卫兵接待站的政治工作员

    “我们在为毛主席接待客人”
    “毛主席派来的好服务员”
    ——记部队派到红卫兵接待站的政治工作员
    首都的冬夜，寒风凛冽。睡在天坛接待站的一位姓刘的同学，却觉得越睡越暖和了。天亮的时候，他才发现，在自己的被子上，又严严实实地盖上了一件军大衣。不问也知道，这又是政治工作员干的。
    政治工作员是部队派来参加接待工作的干部和战士。在北京的许多外地革命师生接待站里，都有这样一些政治工作员。他们虽然来自各个不同的单位，但是他们有个共同的想法：外地革命师生是毛主席请来的客人，我们是毛主席派来的服务员。我们一定要把毛主席的温暖，带给外地革命师生。
    在天坛接待站，天刚放亮，同学们还在酣睡，政治工作员们就披着晨曦，把周围环境打扫得干干净净，把洗脸水、开水送到同学们跟前。夜里，同学们睡下了，他们逐个查看铺位，帮助同学们盖好被子，关好门窗。女同学崔珍华病了，政治工作员比谁都着急，一次次地问寒问暖，一趟趟地送水送饭。他们用扁担挑着同学们的行李，把一批批同学送走，又把一批批同学接来。
    同学们感动极了。太原师范的关玉良禁不住问道：“为什么解放军同志坚持做了那么多好事？我也想做好事，可往往不能持久，这又为什么？”政治工作员桂玉振说：“只因为我们学了毛主席著作，听了毛主席的话呀！”关玉良又问：“那你们又怎么学习毛主席著作的呢？”
    为了回答这类问题，接待站组织了一个学习毛主席著作经验交流会。会上，政治工作员、某团学习毛主席著作积极分子阎高祥，介绍了他自己带着阶级感情学习毛主席著作，在改造世界观上狠下功夫的体会。在灯光下，同学们聚精会神地听着、记着。
    阎高祥的介绍，使同学们受到很大启发。他们说：“解放军同志学毛主席著作学得好，就是因为他们对毛主席著作有很深的阶级感情。”可是，为什么解放军对毛主席著作的阶级感情那样深呢？有同学提出了这个问题。
    同学们要求进步的强烈愿望，也使政治工作员们深受感动。为了让同学们在接待站里生活得更有意义，他们决定请苦大仇深的政治工作员张兴旺给大家讲家史。
    这天夜晚，同学们结束了一天的参观访问，围坐在电灯光下，静静地听着张兴旺回忆自己的苦难家史。张兴旺的祖父，被日本鬼子抓去做劳工，死于法西斯强盗的刺刀之下。他的父亲欠了地主一笔高利贷。一天晚上，地主把他父亲叫去，逼着他交出家里仅有的几间窑洞，回来的路上，又被日本鬼子杀死。民族仇，阶级恨，擦亮了张兴旺的眼睛。张兴旺激动地对大家说：毛主席是我们的大救星，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。毛主席的书，我们一定要读，毛主席的话，我们一定要听。为了实践毛主席的教导，我不惜付出自己的鲜血和生命！
    忆苦会结束了，革命师生们的心久久不能平静。他们三三两两地议论着。有的说：“这下我明白了，解放军同志对毛主席著作有那样深厚的阶级感情，是因为他们不忘阶级苦，爱憎最分明。”有的说：“我们向解放军学习，就要像解放军那样，怀着强烈的阶级感情去学习毛主席著作。”
    一系列富有政治内容的活动，使革命师生受到极大教育。同学们学习毛主席著作的积极性更高了。他们自动组织起学习小组，每天抽出两三小时带着问题进行学习，许多人还坚持天天写学习笔记。
    同学们以政治工作员为榜样，学一点，用一点，共产主义风格大发扬，好人好事层出不穷。每天清早，他们夺走政治工作员手上的扫帚、水桶，抢着打扫环境卫生，提洗脸水。有的同学生了病，就轮流守候在铺前，细心进行照顾……。
    十一月十一日，我们伟大领袖毛主席接见了外地来京串连的革命师生。太原师范二十三位同学怀着幸福的心情要离开北京了，政治工作员们帮同学们背着背包，一直把他们送到火车站。短短几天的时间，革命师生和政治工作员建立了深厚的阶级感情。离别的时刻，许多同学依依不舍，流下了激动的热泪。不少同学说：“几天的共同生活，使我们认识到，解放军确实值得我们学习。回去以后，我们一定要像解放军那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。一定要像解放军那样突出政治，发扬三八作风，使自己成为解放军的可靠的后备军。”
