How to Timely Discover the Buds of Thought Problems

Some company leaders have reflected that it is difficult to grasp the buds of thought problems. The difficulties lie in three aspects: it is hard to see and grasp the problem when it just emerges; it is hard to grasp the essence when the situation is complex; it is hard to grasp the law when the situation changes frequently. The main reasons for this situation are as follows: First, the connection with the masses is not close enough, and they cannot truly blend in with the soldiers, so the soldiers are not willing to share their thoughts with them; second, their thoughts are not rigorous enough and not sensitive enough, so some thought buds slip by under their noses; third, they have not fully mobilized the masses to work together, and the opinions from below cannot be reflected in a timely manner.

How to timely discover the buds of thought problems?

1. Be the soldiers' confidant. With the sentiment of class brothers, care for and cherish the soldiers. Treat the growth of soldiers as your greatest responsibility and always think of their progress. When soldiers fall ill, leaders should care for them; when soldiers encounter difficulties or misfortunes in their families, leaders should enthusiastically help and comfort them. In daily life, work, and labor, leaders should put aside their airs and practice the "five together" (eating together, living together, laboring together, having fun together, and working together), blending in completely with the soldiers. When soldiers trust the leaders, they will share everything, making it easier to grasp the soldiers' thoughts and timely discover thought buds.

2. Improve the sensitivity of observing problems. Educate leaders to understand that only by thoroughly grasping the spirit from above and following it closely can they clearly see and grasp the problems below. The party branch should regularly organize leaders to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, timely study the party's policies and upper-level instructions, arm themselves with weapons, discern the direction of the wind, and enhance sensitivity. Regularly use the "mirror" of class struggle to examine how domestic and international class struggles affect the soldiers and how the soldiers' thoughts reflect social class struggles, discovering thought buds from this. Regularly use the party's policy regulations as a "ruler" to "measure" the soldiers' thoughts and actions, seeing what conforms to the party's requirements and what does not, discovering problems from this.

3. Often go deep into the platoons, observe more, listen more, ask more, and think more. Be good at discovering changes in soldiers' thoughts and emotions from their words and deeds. For example, if you see soldiers not eating well or sleeping well, think about what they might be worried about; if you see soldiers avoiding and not approaching leaders, think about what opinions they might have about the leadership. Pay attention to seeing the big from the small and the essence from the phenomenon; from the problems on a few individuals, see the problems with universality.

4. Be familiar with all the soldiers in the company and grasp the laws of thought activities. Company leaders, especially political instructors, should be very familiar with each soldier's family background, personal history, living habits, personality traits, interests, family concerns, and situations in work and study. Always pay attention to observing the soldiers' thought dynamics, explore the laws of soldiers' thought activities. Know what will cause thought changes at what time; on whom thought buds will appear; in what environment thought problems will occur, and have a clear understanding.

5. Mobilize the masses, and let everyone grasp the buds of thoughts. Educate leaders and soldiers to recognize the importance of grasping the buds of thoughts and enhance everyone's sense of political responsibility. Timely let the party's guidelines, policies, and upper-level instructions quickly meet the masses, improving everyone's ability to discern right from wrong. Fully play the role of the core team of thought work, timely listen to their reports, and seriously and calmly analyze the situations they reflect. With a hundred pairs of eyes looking and a hundred brains thinking, the leadership will be keen and able to timely and accurately grasp the buds of thought problems.

How to Grasp the Active Thoughts of Personnel on Duty Outside

Companies often have a few personnel going out on missions. In the situation of being away from leadership and scattered activities, some people may relax their political and ideological requirements; some think that being out on duty is "easier than being in the company" and can be "unrestrained," easily violating policies and disciplines; some think that being out on duty is a "paid trip" and can "sightsee," not paying attention to thrift and economy; some may have changes in thoughts and cause accidents under the influence of a complex social environment.

How to grasp the active thoughts of personnel on duty outside?

1. Overcome the "hands-off" mentality and care for personnel on duty outside. Analyze the company's thought situation and do not forget to analyze the thoughts of personnel on duty outside; check and summarize work and do not forget to check the thought work of personnel on duty outside; develop party and league members and do not forget to develop personnel on duty outside. Ensure that when personnel leave the company, the thought work does not stop.

2. Thoughts first, then actions. Based on the environment, tasks, and thought situation of the area where personnel are going out, do a good job of thought mobilization before going out. Require all personnel on duty outside to: (1) Use the perspective of class struggle to deal with complex social phenomena, draw clear lines between right and wrong, and stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint; (2) Modelly abide by the party's policies, national laws, and military disciplines, and keep state military secrets; (3) Support local governments and love the masses, do good deeds for the people; (4) Be frugal and thrifty; (5) Obey the leadership and care for comrades, and maintain unity. For those executing different tasks, put forward different requirements. For those with thought problems, do a good job of thought work, letting them "go out lightly" without carrying "baggage."

3. Assign tasks, first assign the task of studying Chairman Mao's works. Before personnel on duty outside leave, the leadership should clearly propose learning requirements and help them make a learning plan. During the period of being out, let them, based on the new environment and new tasks, combine their thoughts, learn what they need to learn, and do what they have learned. Require them to "carry Chairman Mao's works with them and study when they have time." If they have more time, concentrate on learning more; if they have less time, "fill in the gaps" and do not stop.

4. Everyone takes action, and everyone manages thoughts. For three or more personnel on duty outside, assign a cadre or party and league cadre to be responsible and establish a party and league small group. Require party and league members to take the lead in grasping active thoughts, timely discover buds, and timely do work. Insist on the "one helps one, one pair of red" activity, helping and supervising each other, "praising good deeds and grasping bad deeds." Educate each personnel on duty outside to be highly self-aware and do the following: act the same whether the leader is present or not, whether there is inspection or not, whether acting alone or in a group, whether the time out is long or short.

5. Strengthen contact with personnel on duty outside. Require personnel on duty outside to actively report their thoughts, work, and learning situations to the company. Company leaders should regularly communicate with or send people to understand the situation of personnel on duty outside, timely helping them solve thought problems and practical difficulties. For those going to sister units to study or work, establish contact with the units they are in, cooperate with each other, and conduct education. During festivals, if personnel on duty outside cannot return, the company should write letters of comfort or send people to visit.

6. After personnel on duty outside return to the company, the leadership should warmly receive them, timely listen to their reports, understand their thoughts and work performance during the period of being out, summarize experiences and lessons, praise good deeds, and if necessary, organize them to report to the whole company. If problems are found, investigate and handle them carefully.

How to Educate Retired Soldiers to Obey Assignments

Some old soldiers, when retiring, think most about where they will be assigned. It is necessary to do a good job of education and inspire them to voluntarily obey the needs of the state.

How to handle it?

1. When old soldiers retire, no matter where the upper level is preparing to assign them, the company must educate them to be mentally prepared to go to the countryside, go to the border, and go to the most difficult places. Propaganda should be made about the great significance of building the countryside and the border. Call on everyone to listen to the party and Chairman Mao: revolutionary soldiers should have aspirations in all directions, "the more difficult the place, the more we should go." Point out that longing for the city and hometown, seeking comfort, and enjoying the status quo are manifestations of a lack of spirit, and young people should establish the ambition and spirit to create new lives with their own hands and change the world together with the revolutionary collective. Explain that whether one can voluntarily obey the assignment and whether one is willing to go to the most difficult places is a test of one's level of awareness.

2. Inspire the old soldiers' sense of honor and fully mobilize their positive factors. (1) Propaganda about the good traditions left by retired old soldiers in previous years. (2) Publicize the advanced examples of old soldiers who firmly obey the assignment. (3) Organize old soldiers to recall their honors and progress, requiring them to cherish their honors and not disappoint the several years of cultivation and education by the revolutionary army. (4) Mobilize party and league branch secretaries, group leaders, and consecutive five-good soldiers among old soldiers to take the lead in obeying the organization's assignment, setting an example for other comrades.

3. After the assignment destination is determined, timely do thought work for each person. (1) Understand each person's opinions on the organization's assignment, any vague understandings, and any problems, and conduct persuasive education with a focus. Emphasize guiding them to correctly handle the relationship between personal interests and revolutionary interests, personal future and the future of the state and class. Truthfully inform them of the situation of the place they are going to. (2) Understand the difficulties that old soldiers assigned to the countryside and border urgently need to solve, and help them come up with ideas and solutions. (3) Some old soldiers are unwilling to obey the assignment, often influenced by the backward thoughts of their families. After understanding this situation, the leadership should inspire the soldiers to distinguish right from wrong and use revolutionary spirit to overcome the negative influence from the family, while also writing letters to educate the family. (4) Ensure that soldiers voluntarily and willingly obey the assignment. For those who do not understand for the time being, persist in the principle of patient persuasion.

4. Call on everyone to raise the red flag and go to new work positions with the glorious traditions of our army. On the basis of educating them to obey the assignment, do two more things: (1) Organize them to have a discussion: how to inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of our army on new work positions? (2) Mobilize soldiers who stay in the army and retired old soldiers to encourage each other to make new achievements for the party's cause on different work positions and strive for new progress.

How to Handle Soldiers Who Think "Being an Infantryman Is a Waste of Talent"

The following are the experiences of ten soldiers who have graduated from high school and college in solving this problem.

Everyone said that when they first enlisted, they indeed had some difficulty accepting being an infantryman. The main problem was: considering personal future, they felt that being an infantryman "could not learn skills" and would not be able to find a good job when returning home; overestimating themselves, they thought that after studying for so many years, "they had a lot of knowledge," and being an infantryman was "using a chopstick as a spear, wasting talent."

How did they solve this problem?

1. Understand where "talent" comes from and clarify for whom "talent" is used. Soldier Chi Daohua said: In the past, I thought that being an infantryman was a waste of talent and felt very troubled. After studying Chairman Mao's works and participating in the company's bitter education, my mind became clear. Reflecting on the past, my ancestors for several generations did not even know how to write a letter, could I have studied so much in the old society? Definitely not. This made me understand that my knowledge ultimately comes from the party and Chairman Mao, is cultivated by the working people, and is obtained by revolutionary predecessors with rifles. Looking down on being an infantryman is forgetting one's roots. Soldier Ning Zhaoxiu said: In the past, I felt that being an infantryman had no future, but after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "In Service of the People," and "The Direction of the Youth Movement," and seeing the model deeds of university teacher Jiao Guanguo being an infantryman, I understood that knowledge comes from the people and must serve the people. As long as one wholeheartedly serves the people, no matter what work one does, there is a future. In the past, the future I considered was based on personal interests, wanting to use the knowledge cultivated by the party to serve oneself, which is the influence of the exploitative class ideology, how could there be a future!

2. Understand how big the "talent" is and whether it is a waste of talent. Soldier Wu Minglin said: At first, I thought I was quite knowledgeable, and being an infantryman was nothing special. Later, the political instructor explained to us Chairman Mao's views on the intellectual problem and educated us not to look down on the rifle, to master a rifle well, first of all, to have good thoughts, and to understand the knowledge of the rifle. Soldier Chi Daohua said: I studied "Rectify the Party's Style," and only then did I understand that there are two kinds of knowledge: one is class struggle knowledge; the other is production struggle knowledge. Having only book knowledge cannot be considered having complete knowledge. Comparing myself, in terms of production, I have no experience; in terms of class struggle, I am even further behind. Studying a few more years does not make one a great talent, and being an infantryman cannot be said to be a waste of talent. Other comrades also said: As long as one has a red heart for the revolution, being an infantryman also has a broad field to display one's talents. Being an infantryman is not a waste of talent but a full use of talent, and the talent is not enough. On any ordinary post, one can serve the people well.

3. The trust of the leadership and the friendship of comrades are also very important. Soldier Yin Chengyuan said: As soon as I enlisted, the company's leadership and old comrades valued me very much, saying that the enrollment of young intellectuals brought new blood to the army, which was beneficial to the revolutionary and modernized construction of our army. Everyone cared for me, guiding me to study Chairman Mao's works, often talking to me, encouraging my progress; I was weak in physique, had difficulties in marching, and comrades rushed to help me carry the backpack; during training, everyone patiently taught me the techniques; when I made progress, the leadership praised me in time, and when I had shortcomings, they pointed them out to me in time. This made me feel very warm in the company. I bravely talked about my thought problems, and everyone helped me more. The enthusiastic care and patient help of the leadership and comrades promoted my gradual improvement in awareness, and I decided to be an ordinary soldier.

How to Handle New Soldiers' Fluctuating Emotions Upon Enlistment

New soldiers, when they first arrive at the company, have fluctuating emotions, mainly due to the following reasons: (1) they are not used to the tight and strict life in the company and feel it is not as comfortable as being at home; (2) the work assignment does not meet their personal wishes, causing regret and dissatisfaction; (3) they miss their family or have family concerns; (4) the cadres' requirements for their discipline are too high and too urgent.

How to handle it?

1. Seriously do a good job of enlistment education and correct the attitude towards service. Through bitter education, situation education, and studying "In Service of the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," make new soldiers clearly establish the thought of fighting for the Chinese people and the people of the world. During enlistment education, especially emphasize and organize new soldiers to talk about and write their family history, helping them establish "accounts of blood and tears" and "accounts of happiness," arousing their class feelings, and improving their class awareness. Use the two accounts as ongoing class education materials.

2. Propaganda about heroic and model deeds, guiding new soldiers to engrave the images of heroes and models such as Norman Bethune, Zhang Side, Lei Feng, Ou Yanghai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun in their minds, using heroes and models as examples to handle their various problems.

3. On the basis of collective education, deeply understand the specific thought knots of new soldiers, such as concerns about family problems, considerations about what kind of soldier to be, etc., strengthen individual education, and help them solve thought problems.

4. Mobilize all cadres and soldiers to enthusiastically care for the thoughts and lives of new soldiers, making them feel the warmth of the revolutionary family. As soon as new soldiers enlist, do a good job of distributing books such as "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and "Enlistment Guide," satisfying their learning needs. Based on the interests of new soldiers, actively organize various cultural and sports activities, making their lives enjoyable. Quickly organize old soldiers and new soldiers to form "one pair of red," making them have someone to help and guide in all aspects of work, study, and life, and also pay attention to solving their practical difficulties. For new soldiers who fall ill, give them more enthusiastic care, careful attention, and heart-to-heart talks. For new soldiers who do not know how to write letters, actively help them write to their families and maintain contact with their relatives.

5. The requirements for new soldiers should gradually become stricter. It should be acknowledged that new soldiers need time to adapt to army life. For them, both strict management and patient persuasion are needed, gradually becoming stricter, teaching a little, doing a little, consolidating a little, and not criticizing them in public if they do not achieve something or violate something. For every bit of progress they make, praise and encourage them more, making them build confidence and quickly adapt to the tight life in the company.

6. Give play to the role of active elements among new soldiers, assign them tasks, teach them work methods, and through them help other new soldiers.

How to Do a Good Job of Thought Work for Soldiers Visiting Home

Soldiers visiting home have the opportunity to contact and understand the class struggle and industrial and agricultural production situations in cities and countryside, which is a good opportunity to receive socialist education. However, if the thought work is not tightly grasped and done deeply and thoroughly, it will bring some negative factors. For example, some soldiers carry "baggage" due to marital disputes; some soldiers are emotionally unstable due to family disputes and economic difficulties; some soldiers are infatuated with small family life, affecting their revolutionary enthusiasm.

How to handle it?

1. Before soldiers visit home, the company leadership should mainly do the following: (1) Assign soldiers to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, socialist education movement, and thrift, giving them ideological weapons. (2) Understand the problems in soldiers' families and the difficulties and plans of soldiers themselves, imagine possible situations, and assign them to use the method of class analysis to correctly handle the problems reflected by family and relatives, stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, and handle them correctly. (3) Bring a letter to the soldiers' families, conveying the greetings of the company leadership and comrades, and introducing the soldiers' progress in the army. (4) Assign soldiers to: inquire about the relatives of fellow soldiers from the same hometown, do things for them; pay attention to investigating and understanding the class struggle and industrial and agricultural production situations in cities and countryside, letting themselves be educated and collecting live teaching materials for the company's political classes; actively help relatives and friends study Chairman Mao's works, propagate the domestic and international good situation and the party's policies to the people, and be propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought; strictly abide by the party's and state's policies and laws, respect local cadres, learn the good thoughts and good style of the local area; carry forward the fine traditions of the people's army, change customs, be frugal and simple, do more good deeds for the people, abide by the people's discipline, actively participate in collective labor; strictly guard military secrets, pay attention to military discipline, and abide by public order.

2. Grasp the active thoughts of soldiers after they return from visiting home, develop positive factors, and overcome negative factors. Mainly do the following: (1) Listen to soldiers' reports on their home visit situations and praise good deeds. (2) Based on the problems in soldiers' families and their thought changes, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to help them improve their awareness and correctly handle the situation, preventing the spread of negative influences. (3) Organize soldiers to talk about their feelings from visiting home, talk about the good situation in cities and countryside, talk about the government's care for military families and the expectations of fellow villagers. Use the class struggle live teaching materials and new people and new things in cities and countryside that soldiers collected from visiting home to educate the company. (4) If soldiers' families have special difficulties or family disputes, and the company cannot solve them, report to the upper level to request the local government to assist in solving them.

3. For individual soldiers who miss their leave, analyze the situation concretely and handle it differently. If it is indeed due to the soldier's illness, the illness or death of a relative, writing a letter or telegram to the company requesting an extension of leave, or due to waiting for a train or ship and exceeding the leave, it should not be criticized, and comfort should be given if necessary. If it is due to weak organizational and disciplinary awareness and not returning on time, it should be criticized and educated.

How to Do a Good Job of Thought Work for Soldiers' Family Members Visiting the Company

Soldiers' family members visiting the company can bring good news about the soldiers' families and the good situation of industrial and agricultural production in cities and countryside, and can also bring live teaching materials for class education. It is also convenient for the army to directly do work for soldiers' family members. However, they may also bring some problems that affect the soldiers' emotions. For example, some families are not harmonious, have economic difficulties, some urge soldiers to get married, some are not satisfied with soldiers being drivers, breeders, or cooks, etc.

How to do a good job of thought work for soldiers' family members visiting the company?

1. Improve awareness and warmly receive them. Doing a good job of thought work for soldiers' family members visiting the company is not only doing mass work but also doing political and ideological work for the whole company. When soldiers' family members visit the company, they should be warmly received. The first meal and the last meal when they leave can be appropriately added with dishes, and it is best for a cadre to accompany them. Cadres should talk to the family members, introduce the soldiers' growth situation, especially emphasize their advantages and progress after enlistment, and solicit the family members' opinions. Actively give soldiers and relatives time to chat about family matters, appropriately reduce public duties, and if necessary, give temporary leave. When family members leave, let the soldiers send them out of the camp or to the nearby station or wharf. For family members who visit frequently or many family members visiting at the same time, they should also be warmly received and taken care of thoroughly.

2. Do work for the family members visiting the company. Introduce to them the situation of army life, study, and officer-soldier unity, making them further understand the essence and fine traditions of the people's army. Understand their intentions for visiting the company and do targeted propaganda on the significance of thrift in national construction, thrift in family management, the significance of young people serving in the army, and the benefits of late marriage, etc. Also, through the soldiers themselves or fellow soldiers from the same hometown, do education work for the family members visiting the company. If there are family members and soldiers who have disputes, the leadership should mediate and reconcile in time.

3. Ask family members to report to the army the achievements of hometown production and construction and the situation of class struggle. What to talk about and how to talk about it, the company leadership should help prepare a little. Also, ask the family members visiting the company to do education work for fellow soldiers from the same hometown; or through the family members visiting the company, send letters to report good news, and do work for the family members of fellow soldiers.

4. If individual family members visiting the company have reactionary remarks or unclear origins, appropriate methods should be taken to investigate, preventing someone from using the army as a "shelter" to escape class struggle, and strictly preventing bad elements from engaging in sabotage activities. Educate soldiers and family members to pay attention to keeping state military secrets.

5. For the practical problems raised by family members visiting the company, if they are reasonable, they should be helped to solve them as much as possible. If they cannot be solved, they should be explained patiently. If family members visiting the company fall ill, they should be treated.

How to Handle Soldiers Who Cannot Be Granted Leave to Visit Home for the Time Being

Soldiers requesting to visit home usually have reasons, such as relatives being critically ill or deceased, sudden disasters at home, living difficulties, or marital problems that need to be handled, etc. However, due to the needs of the army's combat readiness tasks or work, they cannot be granted leave for the time being. In this situation, some soldiers are very anxious and easily have fluctuating thoughts.

How to handle and educate these soldiers?

1. The leadership should empathize with these soldiers' feelings and care for them enthusiastically. Pay attention to the following: (1) Actively do education, open up their minds, and do not avoid or ignore the conflict. Do not push the conflict upwards, saying, "The upper level does not grant leave, the company has no way," and push it off. (2) With deep class feelings, help them remove the burden from their minds. Do not be cold or show impatience. (3) Persuade them patiently, making them voluntarily obey the organizational decision, and do not criticize them arbitrarily.

2. Explain why they cannot be granted leave to visit home for the time being. Explain to them that due to the current combat readiness tasks and the needs of the army's work, it is not possible to solve the problem of visiting home completely according to personal wishes. Organize them to study "In Service of the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," arousing their sense of political responsibility, and when personal interests and revolutionary interests conflict, voluntarily obey the revolutionary needs.

3. In the name of the company's leadership, write a letter to the soldiers' families, explaining the reason why the soldiers cannot visit home for the time being, hoping that they will act from the perspective of revolutionary interests, encourage the soldiers to work hard, and not continue to urge the soldiers to visit home. In the letter, express comfort to the sick, express condolences to the deceased, and provide appropriate relief to those who have serious living difficulties. After writing the letter, show it to the soldiers themselves. If the soldiers' family problems need the local government to assist in solving, report to the regiment political department to write a letter requesting the local government to help solve the problem, making the soldiers feel the warmth of the revolutionary family.

4. Usually, publicize soldiers who can act from the perspective of revolutionary interests, prioritize work, and correctly handle family problems, setting a living example.

5. The soldiers' letters and telegrams should be handed to them in a timely manner and should not be opened or detained arbitrarily. If there are doubts about individual telegrams and letters from soldiers' families, investigate and understand the situation from the side. Do not make subjective judgments, do not casually say that the soldiers' relatives are lying, and do not criticize the soldiers.

How to Educate Soldiers to Be Fearless of Hardship and Fatigue

Some soldiers in the company's strict and tense life often have different degrees of fear of hardship and fatigue. Among them, some are urban enlisted intellectuals, lacking a sense of labor and labor habits; some, although from working-class or revolutionary families, were spoiled from a young age and cannot endure hardship; some old soldiers are afraid of working too hard and being unable to work when they return home; some have weak war awareness, thinking that it is now "peace training" and do not want to train hard in military skills.

How to handle it?

1. Start from improving class awareness and conduct education on not fearing hardship and death, making them gradually establish a proletarian worldview and fundamentally solve the attitude towards hardship and fatigue. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, repeatedly explain the following three points: (1) For whom to endure hardship. Doing revolution is to strive hard. Enduring hardship for the Chinese people and the people of the world is the greatest glory. (2) Why to endure hardship. Now enduring hardship is for winning future battles. If one cannot endure the hardship of heat and cold, one cannot train the hard skills of killing enemies; if one does not endure back pain and leg pain in peacetime, one cannot achieve red-eyed bayonets in wartime. In training, practicing from difficulty and strictness is the leadership's greatest care for the soldiers. (3) Actively participating in labor training can better reform one's thoughts. Loving comfort and hating labor is the ugly ideology of the exploiting class, while enduring hardship and laboring is the noble quality of the proletariat.

2. Conduct education on the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle. Tell them more about Chairman Mao's great examples of revolutionary practice, tell them about the Red Army crossing snow mountains and grasslands, the Volunteers eating fried noodles and snow, and the units participating in the self-defense counterattack on the Sino-Indian border eating great hardships and enduring great labor, and also tell them the heroic stories of their own regiment and company. Explain that class enemies are most afraid of us carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of enduring hardship and laboring and fighting bravely, and most hope that we seek comfort and change peacefully. Educate everyone to take revolutionary heroes as examples, not fearing hardship and difficulties in peacetime, not fearing dangers and sacrifices in emergencies.

3. Understand the laws, grasp the opportunities, and do education in a timely manner. In the following situations, some soldiers often easily have the emotion of fearing hardship and fatigue: new soldiers just participating in training, life is tense; the difficulty of training subjects is relatively large, and the time spent on the same subject is relatively long; rain, heat, cold; transitioning from daily training to field training; transitioning from executing training tasks to executing construction and production tasks; etc. When encountering such situations, organize soldiers to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," establishing the courage and confidence to overcome difficulties.

4. Handle different situations differently. For soldiers who are not afraid of hardship and fatigue, praise them greatly. For new soldiers who have not been trained, do not have too high and urgent requirements, and acknowledge that an ordinary worker, peasant, or intellectual needs a process of training and improvement to become a strong revolutionary soldier. For soldiers who have made progress in overcoming the thought of fearing hardship and fatigue, praise and encourage them in time, helping them summarize their experiences and feelings. For soldiers who are weak and sick and cannot keep up with work, give them necessary care, and do not say they are afraid of hardship and fatigue. For soldiers who intentionally avoid difficult tasks, do not discriminate against them, actively educate them, and care for them enthusiastically, using actual actions to influence them.

5. Cadres should lead by example, eat hardships first, and enjoy later, setting an example for the soldiers, teaching by example while speaking. Mobilize party and league members to help soldiers who fear hardship and fatigue in terms of thoughts, physical strength, and life.

6. During labor assistance and visits to factories and villages, organize soldiers to labor with workers and peasants, learning the revolutionary spirit and noble qualities of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, letting them get more tempering in terms of thoughts and physical strength.

How to Correctly Conduct Criticism

When soldiers have shortcomings and mistakes, cadres often have the following common problems when conducting criticism: before criticism, the facts are not investigated clearly, and even "confuse the names"; presenting facts and reasoning is not enough, small problems are labeled with big hats, and cannot convince with reason; criticism does not pay attention to the occasion and methods; lack of a dialectical view of the criticized person. In this way, criticism cannot achieve the purpose of education.

How to handle it?

1. Cadres should clearly understand and grasp: grasping active thoughts, both praise and criticism are needed, but praise should be the main focus; criticism should be done with the attitude of "treating the disease and saving the person," insisting on the principle of "unity-criticism-unity," not forcing, not sarcasm and ridicule; criticism should start from ideological work, present facts, reason, make the criticized person accept the criticism willingly, and voluntarily correct shortcomings; do not regard soldiers with shortcomings and mistakes as "completely useless" and "unchanging"; all problems that soldiers actively reflect on should be regarded as progress and welcomed.

2. Criticism should pay attention to politics. Mainly see: whether they actively study Chairman Mao's works and seriously reform their thoughts; in the waves of class struggle, can they stand firmly; whether they care about national affairs and correctly handle personal and family problems; can they voluntarily abide by disciplines and obey the leadership, unite with comrades.

3. Criticism should have evidence. Before criticism, conduct detailed investigation and research. For reflections from the masses, definitely verify and confirm. Understand whether it is a thought problem, a recognition problem, or a practical problem; whether it is unreasonable, or a reasonable request; whether it is occasional, or consistent; whether it is intentional, or unintentional, etc. Also, understand the responsibility of the leadership. Then, based on the nature and severity of the problem, study the method of criticism and the opinion of handling.

4. Criticism should pay attention to methods. Chairman Mao said: "True kindness must consider the effect." When criticizing, pay attention to the occasion and scope. Do more individual education and less public criticism. If public criticism is needed, talk to the person in advance. In general situations, do not criticize the platoon leader in front of the soldiers, and do not criticize the soldiers in front of the civilians. When soldiers are "on fire," do not criticize them in a hurry to avoid "butting heads." When criticizing soldiers' shortcomings, affirm soldiers' advantages at the same time; point out the causes and harms of producing shortcomings and mistakes, and at the same time point out the methods and directions of correcting shortcomings and mistakes. When criticizing, be sincere and reasonable. What problem it is, criticize that problem, be practical, do not exaggerate, do not shrink, do not label, and do not dig up old accounts. Based on the nature of the problem, according to the characteristics and acceptance of the soldiers, adopt different methods to conduct criticism.

5. Do a good job of follow-up work after criticism. After criticism, assign cadres to have individual talks with the criticized soldiers, solicit their opinions, and help them further improve their awareness. When the criticized soldiers make progress, the leadership should praise them in time, enhancing their confidence in overcoming shortcomings. When the criticized soldiers fall ill or have difficulties in life, they should also be cared for and comforted. If the criticism is wrong, cadres should actively check with the soldiers, where the criticism was made, and withdraw it there.

6. Educate soldiers to remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "If we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others pointing them out. No matter who points them out to us, it is fine. As long as you are right, we will correct it." Use the correct attitude to treat criticism, not caring about the words and attitude of the criticizer. If the criticism is incorrect, actively explain the situation, do not carry the burden, and do not hold grudges.

How to Correctly Handle Soldiers Who Like to Give Suggestions to the Leadership

A certain regiment's command company commander, Jiong Baoran, shared his thoughts on this issue. He said: Our company has seven soldiers who like to give suggestions to the leadership. They are frank and outspoken, like to manage and talk, and most of their suggestions are good, but some people sometimes do not pay attention to the occasion and methods; some people's suggestions are one-sided and do not completely conform to the facts; some people's suggestions have thorns when giving suggestions, or "dig up old accounts," and "pull small tails." How to correctly handle these soldiers? My experience is:

1. Soldiers who like to give suggestions are an active manifestation of caring for cadres and caring for the construction of the company, and should be welcomed. Not long after I was transferred to the command company, the radio operator Yuan Luchu gave me a suggestion, saying that my style was not deep enough. At first, I really felt wronged, but after calming down and thinking about it, I found that I indeed did not understand the situation of the radio station and the switchboard well, and Yuan Luchu's suggestion was correct. Later, I often went down to the platoon, asked when I did not understand, and learned when I did not know, both grasping thoughts and techniques. Everyone reflected that my work was done comprehensively. Over the past year, these soldiers have given cadres a lot of suggestions. Some cadres sometimes do not understand, and we seriously study Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly treating criticism, correct our attitudes, and our thoughts are clear. Seriously listening to soldiers' suggestions, improving work, slowly tasting the sweetness, and feeling that soldiers who like to give suggestions have many advantages: first, some problems have different opinions from soldiers, and it is better to speak out than to keep them in their hearts; second, it is inevitable that leadership work has shortcomings, the more suggestions soldiers give, the more contradictions can be exposed and solved in time; third, soldiers who like to give suggestions dare to speak their minds, which can make cadres understand the situation below in time, actively do work, and enhance the unity between officers and soldiers; fourth, having a group of soldiers who like to give suggestions in the company, the political atmosphere is thick, which is beneficial to promoting democracy and cultivating the good style of everyone caring for the company.

2. Soldiers give suggestions, and cadres must be able to sit still and listen. Good words should be listened to, bad words should be listened to, correct words should be listened to, wrong words should be listened to, opposing words should be listened to. Do not suppress, do not push back, do not criticize, do not discriminate, and do not retaliate. Truly doing this is not easy. Once, soldier Zeng Guangzu criticized the third platoon leader Tang Yikun for organizing the whole platoon to practice singing as "competitionism." The third platoon leader felt he could not stand it, and the two had a confrontation. Later, I had a heart-to-heart talk with the third platoon leader, and he also thought that Zeng Guangzu's suggestion was correct, but emphasized that Zeng Guangzu criticized him in front of the whole platoon, and he could not bear it. I used Chairman Mao's words, "Because we serve the people, so if we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others pointing them out," to open his mind, making him happily accept the criticism. I realized that the most important thing is to establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. With this thought, one will be open-minded, sincere, and not care about whether one's face is good or bad; even if soldiers give incorrect suggestions, one can bear the misunderstanding and grievance.

3. Praise and encourage more, and have a response to every suggestion from soldiers. We educate all cadres and soldiers in the company to regard daring to give suggestions to the leadership as a manifestation of caring for the company and caring for cadres. All those who give suggestions to the leadership should be praised, even if the suggestions have errors, also praise their spirit of daring to give suggestions. Praising alone is not enough, but also seriously treat their suggestions. Over the past year, a few soldiers who like to give suggestions have given more than thirty suggestions in total. We have analyzed and studied each suggestion, and for those that are correct, we immediately change them; for those that cannot be changed immediately, we explain the situation and reasons; for those that are not completely correct, we accept the reasonable part, explain the unreasonable part individually, and explain the reasons; for those that are completely wrong, we also adopt the attitude of "correcting if there is a mistake, and encouraging if there is none," and do not arbitrarily accuse them. At the same time, educate all soldiers not to say that they "like to show off," "meddle in other people's business," and "do not respect the leadership." In this way, we protect their enthusiasm for giving suggestions.

4. Educate soldiers who like to give suggestions, not only dare to give suggestions but also know how to give suggestions. We often use the method of individual talks to study Chairman Mao's works with them, helping them correctly grasp the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, understanding that criticism is for strengthening unity, improving work, clarifying thoughts, and educating comrades. Therefore, criticism should pay attention to politics, pay attention to the big picture; should adopt the attitude of "treating the disease and saving the person," present facts, reason, prevent subjective speculation; not only should there be good intentions but also good methods, and criticism will have good effects. For individual soldiers who have grudges against the leadership, we actively approach them, have heart-to-heart talks, making them not hold grudges and give suggestions impartially.

How to Unite and Educate Minority Soldiers

In companies where Han soldiers are the majority, newly enlisted minority soldiers usually have some concerns in their thoughts: they are afraid of being bullied by Han soldiers; they are afraid of being called backward by minorities; they are afraid of not understanding the language, having low culture, and not keeping up in political study and military training.

How to handle it?

1. Organize cadres and Han soldiers to study Chairman Mao's teachings on minority issues, study the party's ethnic policies and relevant instructions from the upper level, understand that the unity of various ethnic groups in the country is the basic guarantee for the victory of the socialist cause; uniting minority soldiers is related to the major issue of uniting minorities, helping minorities cultivate cadres, and defending the country's borders with minority brothers. Recognize that some backward phenomena of minorities are the result of class oppression and ethnic oppression in the old society. Be proactive in uniting with minority soldiers, prevent Han chauvinism, and if there are phenomena of disunity, first find the cause and responsibility in oneself.

2. Use facts and reasoning to fundamentally improve their class awareness. Present the class and ethnic blood and tears history. Use the bitter water of the class to brighten the eyes, recognize that Han soldiers and minority soldiers are class brothers, and everyone should be united in heart. Present the history of revolutionary struggle. Understand the life-and-death friendship between Han and minority class brothers in the war years. Now we should inherit the revolutionary tradition, shoulder to shoulder, and defend the motherland together. Present the history of standing up. Use the vivid facts of minorities leaping from slash-and-burn agriculture to the socialist society to explain the meaning of mutual support and help among various brotherly ethnic groups under the leadership of the party. Present the glorious history of the army, conduct education on the nature and glorious traditions of the people's army. Make them distinguish the essence of the people's army and the reactionary army, enhance the class feelings between officers and soldiers and between soldiers.

3. According to the thought characteristics of minority soldiers, provide specific help. Assign party and league cadres who have good thoughts, strong activities, and culture to form "one pair of red" with them. Adopt the method of combining the study of Chairman Mao's works with the study of culture to carry out mass mutual aid activities. In the process of helping, gradually deepen from shallow to deep, from easy to difficult, step by step, and do not have too high and urgent requirements. Encourage their bit-by-bit progress, praise their hard-working, enduring, and disciplined good thoughts and styles. When their achievements do not go up or they make mistakes, the leadership and cadres do not blame, do not complain, help enthusiastically, and educate patiently. In life, take care of the customs and habits of minority soldiers.

4. Pay attention to cultivating active elements among minority soldiers. Develop party and league members, set up models, praise good deeds, and select cadres, all of which should think of minority soldiers. In work and study, fully play the role of active elements and leading role of minority soldiers, and through them do a good job of uniting and educating other minority soldiers.

5. When minority soldiers' family members visit the company, in addition to warmly receiving them according to the company's management and education work regulations, also specially respect their customs and habits. Educate Han soldiers not to comment on their behavior and clothing. When family members bring some food with ethnic characteristics, show enthusiasm when inviting cadres and Han soldiers to eat, and do not refuse to eat because of unfamiliarity.

6. Help minority soldiers learn Mandarin, and at the same time, require Han cadres and soldiers to learn some minority languages, facilitating the exchange of thoughts and strengthening unity.

How to Do a Good Job of Newspaper Reading

Currently, the main problems with newspaper reading in companies are that the leadership does not fully understand the importance of newspaper reading, and the quality of newspaper reading is not high. Specifically, it is reflected in the following aspects: (1) The purpose is not clear, and the pertinence is not strong. As soon as it is time to read the newspaper, find people and find the newspaper, read it as soon as it is found, but do not know what viewpoint to explain and what problem to solve. (2) Only read the news, do not read the editorials and comments, and do not pay attention to combining the study of Mao Zedong Thought, and talk about the matter at hand. (3) The method of reading is inappropriate, just read and do not explain, read once and that's it, do not explain where it should be explained, do not summarize where it should be summarized, especially long articles are read from beginning to end, and soldiers do not listen clearly. (4) Before reading the newspaper, do not pay attention to understanding everyone's discussions and questions about current domestic and international major events, and after reading the newspaper, do not pay attention to collecting reflections, so it is difficult to grasp active thoughts and read without pertinence.

How to handle it?

1. Improve the understanding of newspaper reading. (1) Propaganda about the importance of reading and using newspapers, organize cadres and soldiers to study Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao's teachings on the role of newspapers. Make everyone understand that newspapers can "make the party's line, policy, task, and method of work most quickly and widely meet the masses." Newspapers are invisible political instructors and invisible commanders. Reading newspapers well is an important measure to follow the upper level, grasp active thoughts, and conduct active education, overcoming the tendency to neglect newspaper reading work. (2) Educate cadres and soldiers to be in the company but have a global perspective, always pay attention to international major events, domestic major events, people's major events, party's major events, and army's major events, improving the interest in reading newspapers and cultivating the habit of reading newspapers. (3) Through symposiums or lectures, summarize and publicize the benefits of reading and using newspapers, continuously enhancing the self-awareness of reading newspapers.

2. Newspaper reading should pay attention to grasping major events: grasping the instructions of the Central Committee, Chairman Mao, the Military Commission, and Comrade Lin Biao; grasping international class struggle, major issues of socialist revolution, socialist construction, and army construction in the country; grasping good deeds, good experiences, and good styles inside and outside the army. Refer to the newspaper's important news tips and upper-level newspaper reading instructions, based on the company's tasks and active thoughts, determine the specific content of newspaper reading, especially pay attention to organizing the reading of newspaper editorials.

3. Do a good job of newspaper reading preparation. Before each newspaper reading: (1) Select a few important news items from today's newspaper and a couple of important articles. (2) Select a couple of Chairman Mao's quotations related to the content of the newspaper reading. (3) Check unfamiliar names, places, and words. (4) Paste the newspaper out, circle the content of the newspaper reading, let everyone look at it first, and facilitate listening with questions.

4. How to read? When reading the newspaper, you can first summarize the daily important news, and then read the key articles. When reading key articles, first hint at the key points, explain Chairman Mao's quotations, and then read the content of the article. Or first read the specific content, and then read Chairman Mao's quotations, using Chairman Mao's ideological viewpoint to analyze the content of the article. Long articles can be read in segments, summarize the main idea, and then continue reading. All explanations should be simple and clear. Important articles should leave some time for discussion after reading. Newspaper reading should be clear and emotional, making soldiers like to listen.

5. Do a good job of newspaper reading organization: (1) Have a dedicated person in charge. The company is organized and planned by the political instructor or deputy political instructor, and military and political cadres divide the work to read the newspaper in turns. The platoon is responsible by the platoon leader, and the newspaper reader assists. (2) The main reading of major news, important editorials, and articles is during formal time, and extracurricular newspaper reading can read general news communications. (3) Major news, important editorials, and articles are read by cadres, and after reading, pay attention to understanding the soldiers' active thoughts, so as to solve them in the next newspaper reading or other educational activities. (4) Strengthen the supporting activities of newspaper reading: the club sets up reading, clipping, and current affairs question-and-answer columns, and the blackboard newspaper often publishes domestic and international major news and related situation maps.

How to Guide Soldiers in Reading Revolutionary Novels

Young soldiers like to read revolutionary novels, which is a good thing. However, some spend too much time and energy reading novels, affecting political study and work; some lack the ability to distinguish, cannot analyze and criticize the negative things described, and even pursue some low-level interests. For soldiers reading novels, some cadres are afraid of "being influenced badly" and passively stop them; some just let it go and do not guide them.

How to handle it?

1. Revolutionary novels are auxiliary materials for studying Chairman Mao's works. As long as they are organized and guided well, they can help soldiers better understand Chairman Mao's teachings; can conduct vivid class education, traditional education, and revolutionary heroism education for soldiers; can enrich the company's cultural life, and use proletarian ideology to occupy the extracurricular battlefield. Therefore, it should be actively advocated and guided, and cannot be opposed to studying Chairman Mao's works.

2. Educate soldiers to consciously put studying Chairman Mao's works in the first place. Explain that actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works is the foundation of revolutionary soldiers, and the main energy and time should be spent on this; only by mastering the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, reading novels can be educated, and "flowers" and "poisonous weeds" can be distinguished, avoiding the acceptance of bad influences; reading novels should use spare time, leisure time, and holidays, and should be put down at any time, not interfering with work and collective activities.

3. Guide soldiers to connect reading revolutionary novels with studying Chairman Mao's works and reforming thoughts. (1) Read novels based on the need to study Chairman Mao's works. Surrounding the study of an article or a viewpoint of Chairman Mao's works, organize soldiers to read some revolutionary novels in a planned way, using the vivid and moving typical images in the novels to deepen the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought. (2) Organize soldiers to read revolutionary novels combined with combat readiness training, daily work, and real thoughts, with questions and purposes. Think about what Chairman Mao said, see how the advanced characters in the novels did, clarify what they should do, cultivate revolutionary sentiments, and inspire revolutionary will. (3) Guide soldiers to read novels with the perspective of class struggle. Use the method of class analysis to analyze the characters and plots in the novels, learn the noble qualities of positive characters, and criticize the bad thoughts and behaviors of negative characters. (4) Inspire soldiers to have revolutionary hero images in their minds after reading revolutionary novels, and make them their examples.

4. Help soldiers choose good books and guide them on the right path. Advocate reading modern revolutionary novels, revolutionary struggle memoirs, factory histories, village histories, family histories, company histories, excellent works related to the creation of four-good companies, stories of heroes on various fronts, etc. Read less or not read classical novels, and resolutely not read pornographic novels and ghost stories. The league branch and the revolutionary soldiers' committee should do a good job of the company's library, through book introductions, reading lectures, telling revolutionary stories, lectures, and recitation meetings, strengthen specific guidance.

5. Grasp the active thoughts of soldiers who like to read novels. Educate them to understand that there is also a struggle between eliminating bourgeois ideology and promoting proletarian ideology in the issue of reading novels. For individual soldiers who cannot read novels with the correct attitude, timely guide them. For example, for soldiers who specially "appreciate" the low-level interests described in novels, educate them to be vigilant against the infiltration of bourgeois ideology; for soldiers who read novels purely to improve their writing skills and want to become famous, educate them to overcome individualism.

    怎么办
    ——广州部队总结的“抓活思想的六十多个怎么办”选登（续）
    怎样及时发现思想问题的苗头
    有些连队干部反映抓思想苗头有“三难”：难在问题刚露头，看不清，抓不住；难在事情很复杂，现象易看，本质难抓；难在情况多变化，摸不到规律，打不了主动仗。这种情况主要有三个方面的原因：一是联系群众不够密切，不能和战士真正打成一片，战士不愿意向他们讲心里话；二是思想不够艰苦，不够敏感，有些思想苗头在眼皮底下滑过去了；三是没有充分发动群众一起抓，下面的意见不能及时反映上来。
    怎样才能及时发现思想问题的苗头？
    一、做战士的贴心人。以阶级兄弟的感情，关怀爱护战士。把关心战士的成长，当作自己最大的责任，处处为他们的进步着想。战士有了疾病，干部体贴照顾；战士有了困难，或家庭发生了不幸，干部热情帮助，亲切安慰。在日常生活、工作、劳动中，干部放下架子，实行“五同”，完全和战士打成一片。战士对干部无限信赖，就会无话不谈，也就容易掌握战士的思想脉搏，及时发现思想苗头。
    二、提高观察问题的敏感性。教育干部懂得，对上头的精神吃得透，跟得紧，下头的问题才能看得清，抓得住。党支部要经常组织干部学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的论述，及时学习党的政策和上级指示，掌握武器，识别风向，增强敏感。经常用阶级斗争的“镜子”照一照，看国内外阶级斗争对战士有什么影响，战士的思想反映和社会上阶级斗争有什么联系，从中发现思想苗头。经常用党的政策规定当作“尺子”，“量一量”战士的思想行动，看哪些符合党的要求，哪些不符合党的要求，从中发现问题。
    三、经常深入班排，多看、多听、多问、多想。善于从战士的言行中，发现他们思想情绪的变化。例如，看到战士吃不香，睡不甜，就想一想他们有什么心事；看到战士对干部躲躲闪闪，不爱接近，就想一想他们对领导有什么意见。注意从小看大，从现象看本质；从个别人身上的问题，看到带普遍性的问题。
    四、熟悉全连战士，掌握思想活动的规律。连队干部，特别是指导员，对每个战士的家庭出身、个人经历、生活习惯、个性特点、兴趣爱好，以及家庭牵挂和工作、学习中的情况，都要非常熟悉，了如指掌。时刻留心观察战士的思想动态，摸索战士思想活动的规律。对于在什么时候会引起什么思想变化；在哪些人身上会出现什么思想苗头；在什么环境下会发生什么思想问题，做到心里有底。
    五、发动群众，人人抓思想苗头。教育干部、战士认识抓思想苗头的重要性，增强大家的政治责任感。及时让党的方针、政策和上级的指示，迅速与群众见面，提高大家辨别是非的能力。充分发挥思想骨干队伍的作用，及时听取他们的汇报，认真、冷静地分析他们反映的情况。全连百十双眼睛都来看，百十个脑子都来想，领导上就会耳聪目明，能够及时、准确地抓住思想问题的苗头。
    怎样抓好外出人员的活思想
    连队经常有少数人员外出执行任务。在远离领导、分散活动的情况下，有的人容易放松政治思想上的要求；有的认为外出“比在连队轻松”，可以“不受约束”，容易违犯政策纪律；有的认为外出是“公费旅行”，可以“游山逛景”，不注意勤俭节约；有的在复杂的社会环境影响下，容易引起思想变化，发生事故。
    怎样抓好外出人员的活思想？
    一、克服“大撒手”的思想，处处关心外出人员。分析连队思想情况，不忘分析外出人员的思想；检查总结工作，不忘检查外出人员的思想工作；发展党团员，不忘发展外出人员。做到外出人员离开连，思想工作不断线。
    二、人员未动，思想先行。根据外出地区的环境、任务和外出人员的思想情况，做好外出前的思想动员。要求所有外出人员：（1）用阶级斗争观点，对待复杂的社会现象，划清是非界限，站稳无产阶级立场；（2）模范地遵守党的政策、国家的法令和军队的纪律，保守国家军事机密；（3）拥护地方政府，热爱人民群众，为群众做好事；（4）艰苦朴素，勤俭节约；（5）服从领导，关心同志，搞好团结。对执行不同任务的人，分别提出不同的要求。对有思想问题的人，要做好思想工作，让他们“轻装上阵”，不背着“包袱”外出。
    三、交任务，首先交学习毛主席著作的任务。外出人员临走之前，领导上要明确提出学习要求，帮助他们订好学习计划。外出期间，让他们根据新环境、新任务，结合自己的思想，需要什么学什么，学了就做。要求他们“毛主席著作随身带，有空学起来”。时间多，就集中学，多学点；时间少，就“见缝插针”，不断线。
    四、大家齐动手，人人管思想。对三个以上外出人员，要指定干部或党团骨干负责，建立党团小组。要求党团员带头抓好活思想，及时发现苗头，及时进行工作。坚持“一帮一、一对红”活动，互相帮助，互相监督，“好事有人夸，坏事有人抓”。教育每个外出人员，发扬高度自觉，做到：领导不在和领导在一个样，无人检查和有人检查一个样，单独活动和集体活动一个样，外出时间长和时间短一个样。
    五、加强同外出人员的联系。要求外出人员主动向连队汇报思想、工作和学习情况。连队领导定期和外出人员通信或派人去了解情况，及时帮助他们解决思想问题和实际困难。对于到兄弟单位学习或工作的人员，要同所在单位建立联系，互相配合，进行教育。逢年过节，外出人员不能回来时，连队要写信慰问或去人探望。
    六、外出人员回连后，领导热情接待，及时听取汇报，了解他们外出期间的思想和工作表现，总结经验教训，表扬好人好事，必要时，可以组织他们向全连汇报。发现问题，经过调查，慎重处理。
    怎样教育退伍老战士服从分配
    一些老战士退伍时，考虑最多的是分配到什么地方去。应该很好地进行教育，启发他们自觉地服从国家需要。
    怎么办？
    一、老战士退伍时，不管上级准备分配他们到哪里去，连队一定要教育他们作好到农村去、到边疆去、到最艰苦地方去的思想准备。宣传建设农村、建设边疆的伟大意义。号召大家听党和毛主席的话：革命战士要志在四方，“越是困难的地方越是要去”。指出留恋城市和家乡，图安逸，享现成，是没有志气的表现，青年人要树立用自己双手去创造新的生活，同革命的集体一起去改天换地的雄心壮志。说明能不能自觉地服从分配，愿不愿到最艰苦的地方去，是对每个人的觉悟水平的考验。
    二、激发老战士的荣誉感，充分调动他们的积极因素。（1）宣传历年来退伍老战士留下的好传统。（2）宣扬退伍老战士中坚决服从分配的先进典型。（3）组织老战士回忆荣誉，回忆进步，要求他们珍惜自己的荣誉，不要辜负革命部队几年来的培养教育。（4）发动老战士中的党团支委、小组长、连续几年的五好战士等骨干，带头服从组织的分配，给其他同志作出榜样。
    三、分配去向决定后，及时把思想工作做到每个人身上。（1）了解每个人对组织的分配有什么意见，有什么模糊认识，有针对性地进行说服教育。着重开导他们正确对待个人利益与革命利益的关系，个人前途与国家、阶级前途的关系。要如实地向他们说明所去地方的情况。（2）了解分配去农村和边疆的老战士，有哪些急待解决的困难，帮助他们出主意、想办法。（3）有些老战士不愿服从分配，常常是受家庭落后思想的影响。摸清这种情况后，领导要启发战士分清是非，用革命精神克服来自家庭的消极影响，同时去信教育家庭。（4）要做到使战士自觉自愿地服从分配，对一时思想不通的，要坚持耐心说服的原则。
    四、号召人人高举红旗，带着我军的光荣传统走上新的工作岗位。在教育他们服从分配的基础上，再做好两件事：（1）组织他们座谈：在新的工作岗位上，怎样继承和发扬我军的优良传统？（2）发动留队战士和退伍老战士互相勉励，在不同的工作岗位上为党的事业做出新的成绩，争取新的进步。
    对认为“当步兵大材小用”的知识青年战士怎么办
    下面是十个念过高中和大学的知识青年战士谈他们解决这个问题的体会。
    大家说，刚入伍时，对当步兵的确有点想不通。主要问题是：为个人前途打算，感到当步兵“学不到技术”，将来回家“找不到好工作”；对自己估计过高，认为读了十几年书，“很有知识”，当步兵是“电线杆当筷子，大材小用”。
    他们是怎样解决这个问题的？
    一、弄清“材”从何来，明确“材”为谁用。战士池大华说：过去我认为，当步兵是大材小用，感到很苦恼。经过学习毛主席著作，参加连队的忆苦教育，我心里亮堂了。回想解放前，我家祖宗好几代，连一个会写信的也没有，我如果在旧社会能读这么多书吗？肯定是不可能的。这使我懂得，我的知识归根结底是党和毛主席给的，是劳动人民培养的，是革命前辈用步枪打天下得来的。看不起当步兵就是忘了本。战士宁兆修说：过去我感到当步兵没有前途，经过学习《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》、《青年运动的方向》，又看了大学教师焦光国当步兵等模范事迹的材料，使我弄清了知识来源于人民，必须服务于人民。只要全心全意为人民服务，无论干什么工作都有前途。过去我所考虑的前途，是从个人的利益出发，想用党培养出来的知识为个人服务，这是剥削阶级思想的影响，怎么能有前途呢！
    二、弄清“材”有多大，是不是大材小用。战士吴明邻说：起初，我以为自己挺有知识，当个步兵没有什么了不起。后来，指导员给我们讲解了毛主席关于知识分子问题的论述，还教育我们不要小看步枪，要掌握好一支步枪，首先要思想好，还要懂得枪的知识。战士池大华说：我学了《整顿党的作风》，才懂得知识有两门：一门是阶级斗争知识；一门是生产斗争知识。只有书本知识，不能算有完全的知识。对照我自己，讲生产，没有经验；讲阶级斗争，差得更远。多读几年书，算不得大材，当步兵不能说是小用。其他同志也说：只要一颗红心为革命，当步兵同样有着发挥自己才能的广阔天地。当步兵不是大材小用，而是材尽其用，材还不够用。在任何平凡的岗位上，都可以很好地为人民服务。
    三、领导上的信赖和同志们的友爱也很重要。战士尹承元说：一入伍，连的领导和老同志对我们就很器重，说我们知识青年入伍，给部队增添新的血液，有利于我军革命化现代化建设。大家对我很关心，指导我学习毛主席著作，经常找我谈话，鼓励我进步；我体格弱，行军有困难，同志们抢着帮我背背包；平时训练，大家耐心教我学要领；我有了进步，领导上及时表扬，有了缺点也及时给我指出来。这使我感到在连队很温暖。我大胆地把自己的思想问题谈了出来，大家对我帮助更多。领导和同志们的热情关怀，耐心帮助，促使我逐步提高了认识，决心当个普通一兵。
    新战士刚入伍情绪容易波动怎么办
    新战士刚到连队，思想情绪容易波动，原因主要有：（1）对连队紧张严格的生活不习惯，感到不如在家自在；（2）分配工作没有达到个人愿望，产生后悔和不满的情绪；（3）思念亲人或有家庭牵挂；（4）干部对他们管教上要求过高过急。
    怎么办？
    一、认真搞好入伍教育，端正服役态度。通过忆苦教育、形势教育，和学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，使新战士明确树立为中国人民和世界人民当兵打仗的思想。入伍教育中，特别要启发和组织新战士谈家史，写家史，帮助他们建立起“血泪账”、“幸福账”，激发他们的阶级感情，提高他们的阶级觉悟。并运用两本账作为经常性阶级教育的活材料。
    二、宣传英雄模范事迹，引导新战士把白求恩、张思德、雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊等英雄形象，刻在脑子里，以英雄模范作榜样，来处理自己的各种问题。
    三、在集体教育的基础上，深入摸清新战士的具体思想疙瘩，如顾虑家庭问题，考虑当什么兵的问题等，加强个别教育，帮助他们解决思想问题。
    四、发动全体干部战士热情关怀新战士的思想、生活，使他们感到革命大家庭的温暖。新战士一入伍，就做好发放《毛泽东著作选读》、《毛主席语录》、《入伍须知》等书籍的工作，满足他们的学习要求。根据新战士的爱好，积极开展各种文娱体育活动，使他们生活过得愉快。迅速组织老战士和新战士结成“一对红”，使他们在工作、学习、生活各方面，时时有人帮，处处有人带，还要注意解决他们的实际困难。对生病的新战士，更要热情关怀，细心照顾，问寒问暖，谈心体贴。对不会写信的新战士，要主动帮助他们给家里写信，和亲人取得联系。
    五、对新战士的要求要逐步从严。要承认新战士习惯部队生活需要有一个过程。对他们既要严格管理，又要耐心说服，要逐步从严，教一点，做一点，落实巩固一点，一时做不到或有所违犯，不要当众给予批评。对他们的每一点进步，要多表扬，多鼓励，使他们树立信心，迅速适应连队的紧张生活。
    六、发挥新战士中的积极分子的作用，交给他们任务，教给他们工作方法，通过他们去帮助其他新战士。
    怎样做好探家战士的思想工作
    战士探家，有机会接触和了解城乡阶级斗争和工农业生产情况，是接受社会主义教育的好时机。但是，如果思想工作抓得不紧，做得不深不细，就会带来一些消极因素。例如有的因为婚姻纠纷，背了包袱；有的因为家庭不和、经济困难，情绪不安；有的因为迷恋小家庭生活，影响了革命干劲。
    怎么办？
    一、战士探家前，连队领导主要做好以下几件事：（1）交代探家战士学习毛主席有关阶级斗争、社会主义教育运动和勤俭节约的论述，交给他们思想武器。（2）了解战士家庭有什么问题，战士个人有什么困难和打算，设想可能遇到的情况，交代他们运用阶级分析方法，正确对待家庭亲友所反映的问题，站稳无产阶级立场，正确处理。（3）给探家战士的家庭带一封信，捎去连队领导和同志们的问候，介绍战士在部队的进步情况。（4）要交代战士：探问同乡战友的亲人，代他们办事情；注意调查了解城乡阶级斗争和工农业生产情况，让本人受教育和为连队政治课收集活教材；积极帮助亲友学习毛主席著作，向人民群众宣传国内外大好形势和党的政策，做毛泽东思想宣传员；严格遵守党和国家的政策法令，尊重地方干部，学习地方的好思想、好作风；发扬人民军队优良传统，移风易俗，艰苦朴素，多为人民群众做好事，遵守群众纪律，积极参加集体劳动；严守军事机密，注意军容风纪，遵守公共秩序。
    二、抓好战士探家回来后的活思想，发扬积极因素，克服消极因素。主要做好：（1）听取战士汇报探家期间的情况，表扬好人好事。（2）针对探家战士家庭存在的问题和本人的思想变化，以毛泽东思想为武器，帮助他们提高认识，正确对待，防止散布不好的影响。（3）组织战士谈探家的感受，讲城乡大好形势，讲政府对军属的照顾和乡亲的期望。运用战士探家收集来的阶级斗争活教材和城乡新人新事，对连队进行教育。（4）战士家庭有特殊困难或家事纠纷，连队无法解决时，应报告上级请求地方政府协助解决。
    三、个别战士误了假，要具体分析，区别对待。如果确实因为本人生病，亲人病危、病亡，向连队写信、打电报要求续假，或因为等车船而超假，就不应该批评，必要时给予安慰。如果因为组织纪律观念不强，不按时归队，就应该进行批评教育。怎样做好来队战士家属的工作
    战士家属来队探望，可以带来战士家庭和城乡工农业生产大好形势的喜讯，可以带来阶级教育的活教材，也便于部队直接把工作做到战士家属身上。但是，也可能带来一些影响战士情绪的问题。如有的家庭不和，生活困难，有的催战士结婚，有的不满意战士当驭手、饲养员、炊事员，等等。
    怎样做好来队战士家属的工作？
    一、提高认识，热情接待。做好来队战士家属的工作，不仅是做了群众工作，而且是做了全连战士的政治思想工作。战士家属来队，要热情接待。家属来队的第一餐和离队时的一餐可以适当加菜，尽可能由一名干部作陪。干部要和家属谈话，介绍战士的成长情况，着重讲优点和入伍后的进步，并征求家属的意见。主动给战士与亲属畅叙家常的时间，适当减免公差勤务，必要时给予临时假日。家属走时，让战士送出营区或送到附近车站、码头。对来队次数较多的家属，或同一时期来队家属较多，也要热情接待，照顾周全。
    二、向来队家属进行工作。向他们介绍部队生活、学习、官兵团结等方面的情况，使他们进一步认识人民军队的本质和优良传统。了解他们来队的意图，有针对性地宣传勤俭建国、勤俭持家的意义，青年服兵役的意义，晚婚的好处等。还可以通过战士本人或同乡战士，向来队家属进行教育。有的家属和战士闹意见，领导要及时劝说调解。
    三、请家属向部队报告家乡生产建设成绩和阶级斗争情况。讲什么，怎么讲，连队领导应帮助作点准备。还可以请来队家属对同乡战士作教育工作；或通过来队家属捎信报喜，对同乡战士的家属进行工作。
    四、如果发现个别来队家属有反动言论，或者来历不清，应采取适当方式进行调查，防止有人把部队当作逃避阶级斗争的“防空洞”，严防坏分子进行破坏活动。教育战士和家属注意保守国家军事机密。
    五、对来队家属提出的一些实际问题，如果是合理的，应尽力帮助解决，解决不了的，要耐心解释。家属来队生了病，给予治疗。
    战士要求探家一时不能批准怎么办
    战士要求探家，一般都是有理由的，如亲人病危、亡故，家中突然受灾，生活困难，或者婚姻出了问题，需要回去处理，等等。但由于部队战备任务或工作的需要，一时不能批准。在这种情况下，有些战士心情很急，容易产生思想波动。
    怎样对待和教育这些战士？
    一、领导上要体贴这些战士的心情，热情关怀。要注意以下几点：（1）积极进行教育，打通思想，不能回避不管。不要把矛盾上交，说：“上级不准假，连队没有办法”，一推了事。（2）要带着深厚的阶级感情，去解除他们思想上的负担。不能态度冷淡，或表示厌烦。（3）要耐心劝说，使他们自觉地服从组织决定，不能乱加批评。
    二、讲清一时不能批准探家的道理。向他们说明，由于当前战备任务和部队工作的需要，不可能完全按照个人的要求解决探家问题。组织他们学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，启发他们的政治责任感，当个人利益和革命利益发生矛盾时，自觉地服从革命需要。
    三、以连队领导干部的名义给战士家庭写信，讲明战士一时不能探家的原因，希望他们从革命利益出发，鼓励战士安心工作，不要继续催促战士探家。信中对病者要表示安慰，对死者要表示悼念，生活确有严重困难的要酌情救济。信写好后给战士本人看。有的战士的家庭问题，需要请地方政府协助解决时，应报告团政治处去信请地方政府帮助解决，使战士感到革命大家庭的温暖。
    四、平时注意宣扬能从革命利益出发，以工作为重，正确处理家庭问题的战士，树立活的榜样。
    五、战士的家信、电报，应及时交给本人，不得随便拆阅和扣压。对个别战士家庭来的电报、书信有疑问时，要从侧面进行调查了解，弄清情况。不要主观臆断，不要随便说战士的亲人讲假话，更不要批评战士。
    怎样教育战士不怕苦不怕累
    有些战士在连队严格紧张的生活中，常常产生程度不同的怕苦怕劳累情绪。他们之中，有的是城市入伍的知识青年，缺乏劳动观点和劳动习惯；有的虽然出身劳动人民或革命家庭，但从小娇生惯养，吃不得苦；有的老战士怕累坏了身体，将来回家不能劳动；有的是由于战争观念不强，认为现在是“和平练兵”，不愿苦练军事技术。
    怎么办？
    一、从提高阶级觉悟入手，进行一不怕苦、二不怕死的教育，使他们逐步树立无产阶级世界观，从根本上解决对待苦和累的态度问题。按照毛主席的教导，反复讲清以下三点：（1）为谁吃苦。干革命就是要艰苦奋斗。为中国人民和世界人民吃苦，是最大的光荣。（2）为什么吃苦。现在吃苦是为了将来打胜仗。吃不得炎暑寒冬苦，练不出杀敌硬功夫；平时舍不得腰痠腿痛，战时做不到刺刀见红。在训练中实行从难从严，是领导对战士最大的爱护。（3）积极参加劳动锻炼，才能更好地改造思想。好逸恶劳是剥削阶级的丑恶思想，吃苦耐劳是无产阶级的高贵品质。
    二、进行艰苦奋斗的革命传统教育。多给他们讲毛主席革命实践的伟大榜样，讲红军爬雪山过草地，志愿军一口炒面一口雪，参加中印边境自卫反击作战部队吃大苦耐大劳等英雄事迹，也讲本团本连的英雄故事。说明阶级敌人最害怕我们发扬吃苦耐劳、英勇奋斗的革命精神，最希望我们贪图安逸，和平演变。教育大家以革命英雄作榜样，在平时不怕艰苦，不怕困难，在紧急时刻不畏艰险，不怕牺牲。
    三、摸清规律，掌握时机，及时进行教育。在下列情况下，有些战士往往容易产生怕苦怕累情绪：新战士刚参加训练，生活紧张；训练课目难度较大，同一课目练的时间较长；天雨、天热、天冷；由平时训练转入野营训练；由执行训练任务转为执行施工、生产任务；等等。遇到这类情况，就组织战士学习《愚公移山》，树立战胜困难的勇气和信心。
    四、针对不同情况，区别对待。对不怕苦不怕累的战士要大力宣扬。对没有经过锻炼的新战士，不能要求过高过急，要承认一个普通工人、农民、知识青年，成长为一个坚强的革命战士，需要有一个锻炼和提高的过程。对克服怕苦怕累思想有进步的战士，要及时表扬鼓励，帮助他们总结经验体会。对体弱有病工作跟不上的战士，要给予必要的照顾，不要说他们怕苦怕累。对有意避开艰苦任务的战士，也不要歧视，要积极教育，热情关怀，以实际行动感化他们。
    五、干部处处以身作则，吃苦在前，享受在后，给战士做出样子，一边身教，一边言教。发动党、团员从思想上、体力上、生活上帮助怕苦怕累的战士。
    六、助民劳动和参观工厂、农村的时候，组织战士同工人、农民一起劳动，学习工人、贫下中农的革命精神和高贵品质，让他们从思想上、体力上得到更多的锻炼。
    怎样正确地进行批评
    战士有了缺点错误，干部进行批评时，一般常有的毛病是：批评前，对事实调查不清楚，甚至“张冠李戴”；摆事实讲道理不够，小问题扣大帽子，不能以理服人；批评不注意场合，不讲究方法；对被批评者缺乏一分为二。这样，就不能使批评达到教育的目的。
    怎么办？
    一、干部要明确认识和掌握：抓活思想，表扬和批评两方面都要，但应当以表扬为主；批评要抱着“治病救人”的态度，坚持“团结——批评——团结”的原则，不压服，不讽刺挖苦；批评要从思想工作入手，摆事实，讲道理，使被批评者口服心服地接受批评，自觉地改正缺点；不把有缺点错误的战士看成“一无是处”，“一成不变”；凡是战士主动检讨的问题，应当看作是进步的表现，抱欢迎的态度。
    二、批评要注意政治。主要看：是不是自觉地学习毛主席著作，认真地改造思想；在阶级斗争风浪中，能不能站稳立场；是不是关心国家大事，正确处理个人和家庭问题；能不能自觉地遵守纪律，服从领导，团结同志。
    三、批评要有证据。批评前，要进行细致的调查研究。对来自群众的反映，一定要核对查实。弄清是思想问题，是认识问题，还是实际问题；是无理取闹，还是正当要求；是偶尔，还是一贯；是有意，还是无意，等等。还要弄清领导上的责任。然后，根据问题的性质和情节轻重，研究批评的方式和处理的意见。
    四、批评要注意方式方法。毛主席说：“真正的好心，必须顾及效果”。批评时，注意场合，注意范围。多做个别教育，少当众指名批评。需要公开批评的，事先给本人谈通。在一般情况下，不当战士的面批评班长，不当老百姓的面批评战士。战士在“火头上”，不要急于批评，避免“顶牛”。批评战士的缺点，同时肯定战士的优点；指出产生缺点错误的原因和危害，同时指出改正缺点错误的办法和努力方向。批评时，做到语句恳切，情理感人。是什么问题，就批评什么，实事求是，不夸大，不缩小，不扣帽子，不翻老账。根据问题的性质，针对战士的特点和接受能力，采取不同的方式方法进行批评。
    五、做好批评后的工作。批评后，指定骨干跟被批评的战士个别谈心，征求他们的意见，帮助他们进一步提高认识。被批评的战士有了进步，领导要及时表扬，增强他们克服缺点的信心。被批评的战士有了病，或生活上有了困难，同样要关怀体贴。批评错了，干部要主动向战士检讨，在哪个场合批评的，就在哪个场合收回来。
    六、教育战士牢记毛主席的教导：“我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”用正确的态度对待批评，不计较批评者的言词和态度。批评如果有出入，应当主动说明情况，不背包袱，不抱成见。
    怎样正确对待爱给领导提意见的战士
    某部指挥连连长戎宝安谈了自己对这个问题的体会。他说：我们连有七个爱给领导提意见的战士。他们心直口快，爱管爱说，提的意见多数是好的，只是有的人有时不分场合，不讲方式；有的人的意见有片面性，不完全符合事实；有的人提意见时，话中带“刺”，或者“翻老账”，抓“小辫子”。怎样正确对待这些战士？我的体会是：
    一、战士爱提意见是爱护干部、关心连队建设的积极表现，应该欢迎。我调到指挥连不久，电台报务员袁榴初就给我提意见，说我作风不深入。开始，我真感到冤枉，但冷静地想了想，发现自己了解电台、总机班的情况确实不够，袁榴初的意见是对的。以后，我就经常下到班里去，不懂就问，不会就学，既抓思想，又抓技术。大家就反映我的工作做得全面了。一年多来，这些战士给干部提了不少意见。有的干部有时想不通，我们就认真学习毛主席关于正确对待批评的指示，端正了态度，思想就通了。认真听取战士的意见，改进了工作，慢慢地尝到了甜头，感到战士爱提意见有很多好处：第一，有些问题战士有不同看法，提出来比闷在肚子里好；第二，领导工作有缺点是难免的，战士提意见越多，越能及时揭露矛盾，解决矛盾；第三，战士爱提意见，敢讲心里话，可以使干部及时了解下情，主动做工作，增进官兵团结；第四，连队中有一批爱提意见的战士，政治空气就浓厚了，这有利于发扬民主，培养人人关心连队的好作风。
    二、战士提意见，干部一定要坐得住，听得进。好话要听，坏话要听，正确的话要听，错误的话要听，反对的话要听。不压制，不顶回，不批评，不歧视，不报复。真正做到这一点可不容易。有一次，战士曾广泗批评三排长唐宜坤组织全排突击练唱歌是锦标主义。三排长感到下不了台，两个人顶了起来。过后，我找三排长谈心，他也认为曾广泗的意见是对的，但强调曾广泗在全排战士面前批评自己，面子放不下来。我就用毛主席说的“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出”这段话去开导他，使他愉快地接受了批评。我体会到，最重要的是树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，有了这个思想，就会襟怀坦白，虚心诚恳，不斤斤计较个人面子好看不好看；战士提了不正确的意见，也能受得起误会和委屈。
    三、多表扬，多鼓励，对战士的意见件件有着落。我们教育全连的干部战士，要把大胆给领导提意见看成是关心连队、爱护干部的表现。凡是向领导提意见的，都进行表扬，即使意见有出入，也表扬他们敢提意见的精神。光表扬还不行，还得认真对待他们的意见。一年多来，几个爱提意见的战士总共提了三十多条意见。我们对每一条意见都作了分析研究，凡是提得对的，马上就改，一时改不了的，说明情况和原因；提得不完全对的，接受其中合理部分，不合理的个别作些解释，讲明道理；意见完全错的，也采取“有则改之，无则加勉”的态度，不随便指责他们。同时，教育所有战士不要说他们“爱出风头”，“多管闲事”，“不尊重领导”。这样，就保护了他们提意见的积极性。
    四、教育爱提意见的战士，不但敢于提意见，而且善于提意见。我们经常运用个别谈心的方式，同他们一起学习毛主席著作，帮助他们正确掌握批评与自我批评的武器，懂得批评是为了增强团结，改进工作，弄清思想，教育同志。因此批评要注意政治，注意大的方面；要本着“治病救人”的态度，摆事实，讲道理，防止主观臆断；不但要有好的动机，还要有好的方法，批评才会有好的效果。对个别和领导有成见的战士，我们就主动接近他，谈心交心，使他不记老账，大公无私地提意见。
    怎样团结教育少数民族战士
    在汉族战士占多数的连队里，初入伍的少数民族战士，思想上通常有一些顾虑：怕受汉族战士的欺侮；怕别人说少数民族落后；怕不懂话，文化低，在政治学习和军事训练中跟不上。
    怎么办？
    一、组织干部和汉族战士学习毛主席关于少数民族问题的论述，学习党的民族政策和上级的有关指示，认识国内各民族的团结，是社会主义事业胜利的基本保证；团结少数民族战士，是关系到团结少数民族、帮助少数民族培养干部、同少数民族兄弟共同保卫祖国边疆的重大问题。认清少数民族的某些落后现象，是旧社会阶级压迫、民族压迫的结果。要主动地搞好同少数民族战士的团结，防止大汉族主义思想。如果发生不团结现象，首先从自己身上找原因、找责任。
    二、通过摆事实，讲道理，从根本上提高他们的阶级觉悟。摆阶级的、民族的血泪史。用阶级的苦水擦亮眼睛，认清汉族战士和少数民族战士是阶级兄弟，大家要心连心。摆革命斗争史。了解在战争年代里，汉族和少数民族阶级兄弟同生死共患难的战斗友谊。现在要继承革命传统，携手并肩共同保卫祖国。摆翻身幸福史。用少数民族从刀耕火种跃入社会主义社会的生动事实，说明各兄弟民族在党的领导下，互相支援、互相帮助的意义。摆部队光荣史，进行人民军队性质和光荣传统教育。使他们分清人民军队和反动军队的本质区别，增进官兵之间、战士之间的阶级感情。
    三、针对少数民族战士的思想特点，进行具体帮助。指派思想意识好、活动能力强、有文化的党团骨干和他们结成“一对红”。采取学习毛主席著作和学习文化相结合的办法，开展群众性的互助活动。在帮助中，要由浅入深，由易到难，循序渐进，不要要求过高过急。多鼓励他们的点滴进步，表扬他们吃苦耐劳、遵守纪律的好思想好作风。当他们的成绩上不去或出了缺点时，领导和骨干不指责，不埋怨，热情帮助，耐心教育。在生活上照顾少数民族战士的风俗习惯。
    四、注意培养少数民族战士中的积极分子。发展党团员、树立标兵、表扬好人好事、选拔干部苗子，都要想到少数民族战士。工作和学习中，充分发挥少数民族战士积极分子的骨干作用和带头作用，通过他们做好团结教育其他少数民族战士的工作。
    五、少数民族战士家属来队探望时，连队除了按照连队管理教育工作条例的规定，热情接待以外，还要特别尊重他们的风俗习惯。教育汉族战士不要议论他们的举止穿戴。家属带来一些具有民族特色的食物，请干部和汉族战士吃时，要表现热情，不要因为不习惯就推辞不吃。
    六、要帮助少数民族战士学会普通话，同时，要求汉族干部战士学会一些少数民族语言，以利于交流思想，加强团结。
    怎样做好读报工作
    目前连队读报工作存在的主要问题是，领导上对读报的重要作用认识不足，读报质量不高。具体表现在：（1）目的性不明确，针对性不强。一到读报时间，现抓人，现找报，拿来就读，究竟要说明什么观点，解决什么问题，心中无数。（2）只读消息，不读按语和评论，不注意结合学习毛泽东思想，就事论事。（3）读的方法不当，光读不讲，读一遍了事，该解释的地方没有解释，该归纳的地方没有归纳，特别是长文章一读到底，战士听不清楚。（4）读报以前，不注意了解大家对当前国内外大事的议论和提出的问题，读报以后，又不注意搜集反映，因而抓不好活思想，读得没有针对性。
    怎么办？
    一、提高对读报工作的认识。（1）宣传读报用报的重要性，组织干部、战士学习毛主席、林彪同志关于报纸作用的论述。使大家认识报纸“能使党的纲领路线，方针政策，工作任务和工作方法，最迅速最广泛地同群众见面”。报纸是不见面的指导员，不见面的司令员。把读好报纸当作是紧跟上头，抓好活思想，进行活教育的重要措施，克服忽视读报工作的偏向。（2）教育干部战士身居连队，胸怀全球，时刻关心国际的大事，国内的大事，人民的大事，党的大事，军队的大事，提高读报兴趣，养成读报习惯。（3）通过座谈会或讲用会等方法，总结、宣传读报、用报的好处，不断增强读报的自觉性。
    二、读报要注意抓大事：抓党中央、毛主席、军委和林副主席的指示；抓国际阶级斗争，国内社会主义革命、社会主义建设和军队建设的重大问题；抓军内外的好人好事、好经验、好风尚。参照报纸要闻提示和上级的读报指示，根据连队的任务和活思想，确定读报的具体内容，特别要注意组织阅读报纸的社论。
    三、做好读报的准备工作。每次读报之前：（1）选择每天报纸上的几条重要新闻，选择一两篇重要文章。（2）选择一两条与读报内容有关的毛主席语录。（3）查清不熟悉的人名、地名和字词。（4）把报纸张贴出来，圈出读报内容，让大家先看一看，便于带着问题听读报。
    四、怎样读？读报时，可以先综述每日要闻，再读重点文章。读重点文章要先提示要点，讲解毛主席语录，再读文章的内容。或者先读具体内容，后读毛主席语录，用毛主席的思想观点来分析文章内容。长文章可以读一段，归纳一下大意，再往下读。凡是解释说明都要简单明了。重要文章读后要留出点时间议一议。读报要口齿清楚，有感情，使战士喜欢听。
    五、做好读报的组织工作：（1）有专人管。连由指导员或副指导员组织计划，军政干部分工轮流读报。排由排长负责，读报员协助。（2）正式时间主要读重大新闻、重要社论和文章，课外读报可读一般新闻通讯。（3）重大新闻、重要社论和文章由干部读，读后注意了解战士的活思想，以便在下一次读报或别的教育活动中加以解决。（4）加强读报的配合活动：俱乐部设阅报、剪报和时事问答栏，黑板报经常刊登国内外重大消息及有关的形势图。
    怎样指导战士阅读革命小说
    青年战士喜欢看革命小说，这是好事。但是，有的用过多的时间和精力去看小说，影响了政治学习，影响了工作；有的缺乏辨别能力，对描写反面的东西不能分析批判，甚至追求一些低级趣味的东西。对于战士看小说，有的干部怕“受到坏影响”，而消极制止；有的则放任自流，不加指导。
    怎么办？
    一、革命小说是学习毛主席著作的辅助材料。只要组织指导得好，可以帮助战士更好地领会毛主席的教导；可以向战士进行生动的阶级教育、传统教育和革命英雄主义教育；可以丰富连队文化生活，用无产阶级思想去占领课外阵地。因此要积极提倡，加强指导，不能把它同学习毛主席著作对立起来。
    二、教育战士自觉地把学习毛主席著作摆在第一位。说明活学活用毛主席著作是革命战士的根本，要把主要精力和时间用到这方面来；只有掌握了毛泽东思想武器，阅读小说才能受到教育，才能辨别“香花”、“毒草”，避免接受不良影响；阅读小说要利用工余、课余、假日时间，要随时“放得下”，不要妨碍工作和集体活动。
    三、指导战士把看革命小说与学习毛主席著作、改造思想挂上钩。（1）根据学习毛主席著作的需要看小说。围绕学习毛主席著作一篇文章、一个观点，有计划地组织战士阅读一些革命小说，运用小说中生动感人的典型形象，加深对毛泽东思想的理解。（2）组织战士结合战备训练，结合日常工作，结合现实思想，带着问题，有目的地看革命小说。想想毛主席怎么讲的，看看小说中的先进人物怎么做的，明确自己应该怎么办，培养革命情操，鼓舞革命斗志。（3）引导战士带着阶级斗争观点看小说。用阶级分析的方法分析小说中的人物和情节，学习正面人物的高贵品质，批判反面人物的坏思想坏行为。（4）启发战士看了革命小说，脑子里装进革命英雄形象，作自己的榜样。
    四、帮助战士选好书，引好路。提倡看现代革命小说、革命斗争回忆录、厂史村史家史连史、有关创造四好连队运动的优秀作品、各个战线上英雄人物的故事，等等。少看或不看古典小说，坚决不看黄色小说和神怪小说。团支部、革命军人委员会办好连队图书室，通过好书评介、读书讲座、讲革命故事、讲演会、朗诵会等形式，加强具体指导。
    五、抓好爱看小说的战士的活思想。教育他们懂得在看小说问题上也存在着灭资兴无的斗争。对个别不能以正确态度看小说的战士，要及时开导。如对专门“欣赏”小说中描写低级趣味东西的战士，要教育他们警惕资产阶级思想的侵蚀；对看小说单纯为了提高写作能力，想成名成家的战士，要教育他们克服个人主义思想。　（完）
