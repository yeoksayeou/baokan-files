Indian farmers in some regions, unable to endure the cruel exploitation and severe famine any longer, have risen up to fight for survival.

According to recent reports in Indian bourgeois newspapers, which usually suppress news of peasant struggles, hungry farmers in Bihar State have launched a struggle against landlords, besieging landlords' houses and seizing their grain reserves. In rural areas near Gaya, hundreds of hungry farmers, including women, harvested and distributed crops in the fields, killing and injuring five people who tried to stop them on the spot. Police hurried to the scene to suppress the incident. In the Gaya area, there have been several daytime grain seizures. The bourgeois newspaper *The Hindustan Times* expressed concern on November 6 that violent actions might occur in this region, and rural wealthy families and grain merchants are already feeling anxious.

The farmers' struggle has begun to target reactionary government officials. Reports indicate that in rural areas near Ara in Bihar State, armed farmers attacked a local official, piercing his cheek with a spear. Reactionary authorities sent police to open fire on the peasant masses.

The reactionary Indian government, terrified by the peasant struggle, is implementing a policy of deception and suppression to crush the peasant movement. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visited the most severely drought-stricken areas of Bihar State in early November, using all manner of sweet talk to deceive the peasants, claiming she would "guarantee to do everything possible to help" the peasants and would "carry out constructive work to overcome the current natural disasters," and so on, in an attempt to numb the peasants' fighting spirit and make them believe in the "benevolence" of the reactionary government without fighting back.

At the same time, the Indian government relies on reactionary landlord armed "village volunteer corps" and others to carry out bloody suppression of the peasant struggle. India's semi-official news agency, the Indian News Agency, said that the "village volunteer corps" would be entrusted with the task of assisting the police in rural areas of Bihar State.

    印度农民奋起为生存而斗争

    据新华社讯　新德里消息：印度一些地区的农民，再也不能忍受残酷的剥削和严重的灾荒，起来为争生存而斗争。
    据一向极力封锁农民斗争消息的印度资产阶级报刊最近不得不刊载的一些消息透露：比哈尔邦饥饿的农民展开了对地主的斗争，包围了地主的房子，分了他们的存粮。在这个邦加雅附近的农村中，几百名饥饿的农民，包括妇女在内，收割了地里的庄稼并进行分配，当场打死打伤了五名前来阻拦的人。警察慌忙赶到出事地点镇压。在加雅地区，连续发生了多起白天抢粮的事件。印度资产阶级报刊《印度斯坦时报》十一月六日表示担心这个地区最近可能出现暴力行动，农村中的财主和粮商已感到惶恐不安。
    农民斗争的矛头开始指向政府的反动官员。据报道，在比哈尔邦阿拉附近的农村中，一些武装的农民袭击了一名地方官，用梭镖刺穿了他的面颊。反动当局派去的警察，向农民群众开枪。
    被农民斗争吓破了胆的印度反动政府，正在推行欺骗和镇压的两手政策去压制农民运动。印度总理英迪拉·甘地在十一月初到比哈尔邦旱灾最严重的地区去活动，说尽了种种甜言蜜语企图欺骗农民，说什么她“保证尽一切可能去帮助”农民，要“进行建设性的工作去克服目前的自然灾害”等等，妄图麻痹农民的斗争意志，幻想反动政府的“恩赐”，而不起来斗争。
    同时，印度政府依靠反动的地主武装“乡村志愿队”等等来血腥镇压农民斗争。印度的半官方通讯社印度报业托辣斯说，“乡村志愿队”将受委托执行帮助比哈尔邦乡村地区的警察的任务。
