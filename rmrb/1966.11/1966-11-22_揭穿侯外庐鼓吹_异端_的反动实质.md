    Editor's Note: Today, our newspaper exposes the anti-party elements in the historical studies community, Hou Wailu, who is a member of the Academy of Sciences, deputy director of the History Research Institute, and editor of "Historical Research." He is both a representative of the bourgeoisie who infiltrated the party and a reactionary academic "authority" of the bourgeoisie.

    Hou Wailu and a small group of ghosts and demons in the historical studies community have been spreading bourgeois reactionary historical fallacies in large quantities in the journal "Historical Research" since its inception in 1954. Around 1960, when domestic and foreign class enemies launched a ferocious attack on us, Hou Wailu was particularly active. He collaborated with anti-party elements like Deng Tuo and Wu Han, shooting one anti-party, anti-socialist poisoned arrow after another.

    Hou Wailu has always claimed to be an "old-school Marxist historian," but the facts revealed prove that he was already a lackey of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries during the Anti-Japanese War. Hou Wailu is also a traitor to the nation and an old hand at anti-communism.

    In this great proletarian cultural revolution, we must thoroughly expose the reactionary "authorities" and their reactionary views in the field of historical studies, such as Hou Wailu and his ilk, and fight them to the end. We must thoroughly carry out the cultural revolution in the field of historical studies.

    Hou Wailu has always hung the sign of a "specialist in the history of Chinese thought," engaging in anti-party, anti-socialist activities. Since 1959, under the guise of "thought history research," he has fervently promoted so-called "heresy," which is clearly with ulterior motives. We know that any society has its unified ideology. The long-existing feudal society in China took Confucianism as its unified ideology. This ideology is called "orthodoxy," and anything that opposes this ideology is called "heresy." However, in the long history of feudal society in China, only the ideology representing the peasants' opposition to the feudal system is the true heresy. The "heresy" that Hou Wailu vigorously promotes is still the ideology of the feudal landlord class. This "heresy" and the so-called "orthodox" ideology have no essential difference. They also aim to consolidate feudal rule, and at most, they sometimes feign a posture, criticizing a little to help a lot. Hou Wailu's portrayal of this ideology as "rebellion" in feudal society is like portraying "clean officials" as "protectors of the people's interests." Hou Wailu's promotion of "heresy" in today's socialist society is to oppose the party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

    We need to build socialism and communism, and we must also have a unified ideology. Comrade Lin Biao said: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of 700 million. We need a unified ideology, a revolutionary ideology, a correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought."

    Mao Zedong Thought is the unified ideology of our socialist state. Since 1959, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in our country has been extremely sharp and complex. Those anti-party, anti-socialist bourgeois rightists are very afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, and they come out to oppose it. Hou Wailu racks his brains to recreate one ancient Chinese thinker after another, "trembling and fearful, summoning the spirits of the dead to help them" (Marx), to try to create a historical theoretical basis for their counter-revolutionary crimes against Mao Zedong Thought and to prepare public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration. The "excellent tradition" of the "heretical" thinkers he repeatedly promotes, when exposed, is nothing but a counter-revolutionary black line of "criticize, dismiss, and take revenge."

    Promoting "Criticizing the Emperor"

    In the first half of 1959, a small group of right-opportunists within the party, in collaboration with imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries, launched a ferocious attack on our party in response to the reactionary needs of the overthrown exploiting classes at home. They directly aimed at the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, viciously attacking the party's socialist construction general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and madly attacking the great Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to achieve capitalist restoration in China.

    In June 1959, the big shot of the "San Jia Village" counter-revolutionary clique, Wu Han, hurriedly took the stage and threw out the poisonous weed "Hai Rui Criticizes the Emperor," advocating the counter-revolutionary spirit of daring to "criticize the emperor."

    At this time, Hou Wailu was also vigorously promoting "criticizing the emperor."

    In the draft of the fourth volume of "Chinese Thought History" in 1959, he racked his brains to create a Southern Song Dynasty official, Chen Liang, who dared to "criticize" the emperor. He said that Chen Liang "dared to directly criticize the emperor's every 'arbitrariness,'" and "criticized the emperor's set of 'benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom' as the traditional obscurantism of corrupt rulers."

    Did Chen Liang really criticize the emperor? Opening his "Letter to Emperor Xiaozong," what is clearly visible is: "Your Majesty's resolve to avenge is sufficient to respond to the mandate of heaven; Your benevolence and love are sufficient to unite the hearts of the people; and Your wisdom and enlightenment are sufficient to oversee the biased opinions of all officials. This is the sage ruler of a hundred generations." Such praise and flattery, where is there a hint of "criticizing the emperor"?

    The historical Chen Liang, like Hai Rui, was an unquestionable feudal slave. They both, out of loyalty to the feudal dynasty, offered advice to their masters and worked hard to consolidate feudal rule.

    The Chen Liang in Hou Wailu's pen is a fake Chen Liang, just as the Hai Rui in Wu Han's pen is a fake Hai Rui. They both use the mouths of the dead to vent their own deep hatred for the party and socialism. They advocate "criticizing the emperor" as a pretext, but the real target is the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao.

    Hou Wailu not only meticulously created a fake Chen Liang who dared to "criticize the emperor," but also rummaged through the historical garbage heap to find a large number of so-called "heretics" who dared to "criticize the emperor," and enthusiastically sang the praises of their "rebellious spirit," dressing them up as "heroes" who "plead for the people."

    In April 1959, Hou Wailu threw out the black book "Ideals of Great Harmony in Chinese History," maliciously slandering the people's communes, and deliberately promoting Bao Jingyan and Deng Mu's "sharp criticism of tyrants and cruel officials." In September of the same year, Hou Wailu, in his preface to Deng Mu's "The Lute of Boya," continued to promote his "criticize the emperor" spirit. He quoted a passage from Deng Mu, adding emphasis, alluding to reality: "To take away their food, they cannot but be angry; to exhaust their strength, they cannot but be resentful. The chaos of the people comes from taking away their food; the danger of the people comes from exhausting their strength. And those who claim to govern the people, exhaust them and make them dangerous, take away their food and make them chaotic!" At the same time, he praised the Ming Dynasty official Li Sanchai for daring to "criticize" the emperor: "Gathering wealth and treasures, making the common people have no peace day or night" ("Chinese Thought History," Volume 4, Part 2).

    Hou Wailu is the spokesman for domestic and foreign class enemies. In the book "Ideals of Great Harmony in Chinese History," he viciously cursed the people's commune as "immediate entry into communism, a utopia"; and here he madly cursed the party's leadership ("those who govern the people") for bringing "danger" and "chaos" to society, making the common people have no peace day or night. This is in the same tune as Wu Han's "making the people starve to death" in "Hai Rui Criticizes the Emperor."

    Advocating for the "Dismissal" of Right-Oppportunists

    The ant trying to shake the tree is laughable. In August 1959, at the Party's Lushan Conference, a small group of right-opportunists were thoroughly defeated. They were dismissed from their posts by the party and the people.

    The shameful failure of the right-opportunists aroused the wails of all reactionary forces at home and abroad.

    In September 1959, Wu Han threw out "On Hai Rui," shouting, "Hai Rui was dismissed, the bandits were not all captured, but he was the first to lose his official position. This was something Hai Rui did not expect." Wu Han had just taken the stage, and Hou Wailu quickly followed. In the same month, he threw out "A Survey of Progressive Philosophical Trends in Sixteenth-Century China" in the Khrushchev revisionist's official publication "Philosophical Problems" (see "Historical Research," Volume 10, 1959), advocating for a "Minister of War" from four hundred years ago, Wang Tingxiang, who "suffered 'persecution,'" and crying out for him, saying that this "Minister of War" "has a sense of justice for the people." Hou Wailu also exaggerated the "Donglin Party Struggle." He praised the "opposition" stance of the Donglin Party members, was disappointed and frustrated by the failure of their "political reform movement," and was indignant and resentful about their "discussing politics" being suppressed by feudal autocracy.

    In early 1961, after Wu Han's poisonous weed "Hai Rui's Dismissal" was released, Hou Wailu, under the pseudonym "Changtan," published an article in the "Beijing Evening News" on March 9, collaborating with Wu Han and Liao Misha, and forming a close alliance with the "San Jia Village" gang. He enthusiastically praised "Hai Rui's Dismissal" and gave a knowing smile to the anti-party conspiracy of the "San Jia Village," saying that "the peak of dramatic modeling is in the answer of tendency," and that he himself would also seek such "scientific conclusions" in "Historical Research." He threw out "The Thought Tradition of Not Fearing Ghosts and Gods in Ancient China," madly slandering our struggle against right-opportunism, saying that "some people punish another part of people as sacrifices or human sacrifices." He blatantly declared, "We must overthrow the altar, demolish the temple, and overthrow the gods!" This is the same as Wu Han, openly encouraging the right-opportunists to "try again after failure."

    In May, under the influence of the "San Jia Village" brothers, Hou Wailu threw out "The Outer Biography of Tang Xianzu's 'The Peony Pavilion.'" He maliciously fabricated that Tang Xianzu "dared to criticize the stupidity and ignorance of the Ming Emperor Shenzong," enthusiastically promoting the counter-revolutionary spirit of "deviating from the classics," and singing dirges for the "dismissal" of Tang Xianzu, Du Fu, and Liu Zongyuan.

    In July, Hou Wailu threw out "On the Ideological Nature of Tang Xianzu's 'The Purple Hairpin' and 'The Dream of the South Branch.'" He vividly depicted a person advocating "equal land and active people," Zhao Zhongyi, being "harassed by powerful officials and rich families" and "dismissed," while the people "feared that Zhao Zhongyi would leave them." At the same time, he exaggerated the scene of the "clean official" Chun Yu being dismissed and the elders lying on the road to stop him, saying, "He cannot be stopped! Soon he will be worshipped in the temple, kneeling and praying." This is Hou Wailu's "scientific conclusion" obtained through his so-called "historical research" of "the father of the sea returning south, unable to be stopped, and the Buddha of ten thousand families burning incense"!

    In August, following Wu Han's proposal of the dismissal of a "Minister of War" (Minister of Defense) from the Ming Dynasty, Yu Qian, Hou Wailu wrote a long article in "On the Ideology and Style of Tang Xianzu's 'The Luoyang Dream,'" about a "Lu Sheng" who "opened up a thousand miles of territory, was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Dingxi, added the title of Grand Preceptor of the Crown Prince, and concurrently served as Minister of War." He advocated for this "ambitious noble" who was "harmed by schemes" and "exiled to the ghost gate at the southern border," crying out for him, and viciously cursing, "This is the harm of favor, the inconstancy of favor and disfavor." He also fantasized that this Lu Sheng-like figure would one day be "recalled to the court" to serve as a "prime minister." This is not in tune with Deng Tuo's hope of "reversing the case" for the right-opportunists, placing it in a "clever and capable prime minister" taking over the leadership?

    Singing the Praises of the "Donglin Spirit," Crying Out for "Revenge"

    In 1961 and 1962, the U.S. imperialists, Khrushchev revisionists, and reactionaries from various countries launched an anti-China tide, and the Kuomintang bandits attempted to invade the mainland. At home, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, ghosts, and demons all came out, attempting to "change the sky" and overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    At this critical moment of class struggle, on October 5, 1961, Deng Tuo threw out "Concerning Everything," praising the political aspirations of the "opposition" Donglin Party members in the late Ming Dynasty to the skies. The "wind" and "rain" of counter-revolution aroused the strong resonance of this group of anti-party elements with the "Donglin spirit."

    Hou Wailu, this old hand at anti-communism, acted quickly. He also enthusiastically promoted the "social and political thought and activities" of the Donglin Party members, saying that they had "positive significance" in "improving real politics" and should be given a "scientific evaluation."

    The Donglin Party members were extremely reactionary feudal scholars who were a pack of foxes and dogs fighting for power and profit within the landlord class. All their political activities were to save the reactionary rule of the Ming Dynasty.

    What is the so-called "positive significance" that Hou Wailu keeps talking about? It is a spirit of daring to "criticize the emperor"; it is an "opposition" stance of resisting "powerful ministers" and being labeled as a "heretical party"; it is a "tragic fate" of suffering "severe persecution," being dismissed from office, and even "dying in prison"; it is a "cultural struggle" of forming groups, freely lecturing, widely spreading their ideological influence among the masses, and "using the pen to cut down the world." All of this is to use these historical corpses to promote the counter-revolutionary spirit of Hou Wailu and his ilk.

    These so-called "positive significances" are also the counter-revolutionary black poems of Deng Tuo: "The Donglin School follows the Guishan School, concerning everything in the world. Do not say that scholars are empty talkers, their heads are thrown to the ground, bloodstained." Hou Wailu and Deng Tuo's ilk, with such heartfelt efforts, sing praises for the Donglin Party members, aiming to: inspire those right-opportunists and all ghosts and demons to madly oppose the party, oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, and resist socialist transformation.

    In June 1962, when the Kuomintang bandits were madly shouting "counterattack the mainland," Hou Wailu threw out "Preface to the Manuscript of Fu Shan's Commentary on the Book of Xunzi." Immediately afterward, he threw out "The Popularity and Ideological Nature of Tang Xianzu's Plays" according to the intention of the anti-party leader Zhou Yang. In these two poisonous weeds, Hou Wailu vented his counter-revolutionary emotions, shouting, "The vast sea seems silent, let me sing a long song instead of crying." He thought that our socialist country was already "the rivers and mountains are gone," it was "about to be destroyed," and their opportunity to return had come. Therefore, Hou Wailu, through praising the feudal scholar Fu Shan, hinted to those anti-communist intellectuals: do not be a "slave scholar" who surrenders, insist on the counter-revolutionary stance, and wait for the opportunity.

    Hou Wailu especially made a big deal out of the character Zhu Zheyu. He said that "Zhu Zheyu saw the importance of 'public opinion,' pointing out that the fundamental reason for the fall of the Ming Dynasty was: the gentry (landlord officials) were full of sins, and the people were in deep pain: all had the heart of 'when will the day of destruction come, and we will perish together with you.' Therefore, he believed that as long as everyone worked together, they could achieve victory in the anti-Qing struggle.... 'The children of the world and the heroes and heroes of the world are all my swaddling children and brothers of the same breath, how can they not unite, use their strength, and avenge the deep hatred of seventeen years (referring to the years of Qing rule)!'?" This is Hou Wailu's confession of his counter-revolutionary intentions. He declared that he had an unyielding hatred for the Communist Party, with the heart of "when will the day of destruction come, and we will perish together with you." This is Hou Wailu's public declaration of counter-revolutionary rebellion. He wanted to gather a small group of anti-party, anti-socialist ghosts and demons, "unite and use their strength," to attack the party and revolutionary people with knives and guns, to take revenge and avenge their hatred. This is also what Hou Wailu confessed in the preface to Fang Yizhi's "East and West Equal" in the same year: "I am proud to carry a three-foot sword, gather righteous scholars, and change the dark world."

    Killing intent! Grinding knives! This is how Hou Wailu and his ilk, with tenfold madness and a hundredfold hatred, attempted to seize back their "paradise."

    Our great leader Chairman Mao said well: "In this small globe, a few flies hit the wall and buzz, a few shrill cries, a few sobs." We have the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and our great country is an iron-clad fortress of the proletariat, which no reactionary forces can shake. The counter-revolutionary cries of Hou Wailu and his ilk will eventually turn out to be a mere dream.

    * * *

    The facts show that Hou Wailu has always worn the cloak of an "expert" and "scholar," engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. He has long been colluding with Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and the ghosts and demons in the historical studies community, acting in cahoots and collaborating closely.

    Look: When the revolutionary people of the whole country and the world take Mao Zedong Thought as the brightest red sun in their hearts, they suddenly started talking about "heresy" in history, encouraging people to "deviate from the classics." Deviate from what "classics"? Oppose what "doctrine"? Isn't it to oppose Mao Zedong Thought? What is the "heresy" they repeatedly praise? It is "criticize, dismiss, and take revenge." When domestic and foreign class enemies launched a ferocious attack on the party and socialism, they all started studying "criticizing the emperor"; when the right-opportunists were dismissed from their posts, they one after another brought out historical corpses who were dismissed from their posts, praising them highly; when the class enemies came out in droves, this group also came out to advocate the "Donglin spirit," wanting to "take revenge," wanting to "cut down the world with the pen." In a word, they want to create public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration, attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and achieve capitalist restoration.

    By exposing the counter-revolutionary face of Hou Wailu, we once again prove this truth: history serves a certain politics, either the politics of the proletariat or the politics of the bourgeoisie.

    Hou Wailu and his ilk, such as Jian Bozan, have always opposed history serving the politics of the proletariat. They say that "historical studies study the laws that have long been effective in history and cannot serve the current politics." However, the facts we have exposed fully prove that their "theory" is completely deceitful.

    Their fallacy of "academics should be separated from politics" cannot deceive people. These negative teachers have given us a lesson, that is, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: studying history must use the past to serve the present, and history must serve the politics of the proletariat. At present, we must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the proletarian cultural revolution in the field of historical studies to the end, and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionists like Hou Wailu one by one, fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink!

    揭穿侯外庐鼓吹“异端”的反动实质
    石卫东
    编者按：今天本报揭发的史学界反党分子侯外庐，是科学院学部委员，历史研究所副所长，《历史研究》编辑委员。他既是一个混进党内的资产阶级代表人物，又是一个资产阶级反动学术“权威”。
    侯外庐和史学界的一小撮牛鬼蛇神，从一九五四年《历史研究》创刊以来，就在这个杂志上大量散布资产阶级反动的史学谬论。一九六○年前后，国内外阶级敌人向我们发动猖狂进攻的时候，侯外庐特别活跃，他和邓拓、吴晗等反党分子相互呼应，射出了一支又一支反党反社会主义的毒箭。
    侯外庐一直以“老牌马克思主义历史学家”自居，但揭发出来的事实证明，他早在抗日战争时期，就是帝国主义和蒋介石反动派的一个奴才。侯外庐也是一个民族败类，反共老手。
    在这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要把侯外庐之流的反动史学“权威”和他们的反动观点彻底揭发出来，把他们斗倒、批透，一定要把史学界的文化大革命进行到底。
    侯外庐一贯挂着“中国思想史研究专家”的牌子，干着反党反社会主义的勾当。一九五九年以来，他在“思想史研究”的幌子下，狂热地吹捧所谓“异端”，完全是别有用心的。我们知道，任何一种社会都有它的统一的思想。中国长期存在的封建社会，是以孔子所代表的思想作为它的统一的思想。这种思想被叫作“正统”，凡是反对这种思想的被叫作“异端”。但是，在中国长期的封建社会中，只有代表农民反对封建制度的思想，才是真正的异端。侯外庐所大肆鼓吹的“异端”，却仍旧是那些封建地主阶级的思想。这种“异端”和所谓“正统”的思想并没有本质的不同。他们也是要巩固封建统治，最多有时故作姿态，小骂大帮忙而已。侯外庐把这种思想说成封建社会的“叛逆”，正像把“清官”说成“人民利益的保护者”是一样的。侯外庐在社会主义社会的今天鼓吹“异端”，目的就是要反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想。
    我们要建设社会主义和共产主义，也必须有统一的思想。林彪同志提出：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”
    毛泽东思想是我们社会主义国家的统一的思想。一九五九年以来，我国无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争十分尖锐和复杂。那些反党反社会主义的资产阶级右派分子，对毛泽东思想十分害怕，他们就要出来反对。侯外庐挖空心思，改铸了一个又一个中国古代思想家，“战战兢兢请出亡灵来给他们以帮助”（马克思），就是要想为他们反毛泽东思想的反革命罪恶活动制造历史的理论根据，为反革命复辟作舆论准备。他一再鼓吹的“异端”思想家的“优良传统”，拆穿来看，无非是一条一“骂”二“罢”三“复仇”的反革命黑线。
          鼓吹“骂皇帝”
    一九五九年上半年，一小撮党内的右倾机会主义分子配合帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派掀起的反华大合唱，适应国内被推翻了的剥削阶级的反动需要，向我们党发动了猖狂进攻，矛头直接指向以毛主席为首的党中央。他们恶毒攻击党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社，疯狂攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，妄图在中国实现资本主义复辟。
    一九五九年六月，“三家村”反革命集团的大将吴晗急忙上阵，抛出了《海瑞骂皇帝》这株大毒草，宣扬敢于“骂皇帝”的反革命精神。
    这时，侯外庐也在竭力鼓吹“骂皇帝”。
    他在一九五九年定稿的《中国思想通史》第四卷中，挖空心思地塑造了一个敢于“骂”皇帝的南宋官僚陈亮。他说什么陈亮“敢于直斥皇帝的一切‘独断’”，“指骂皇帝的一套‘仁义礼智’是腐败统治者的蒙昧主义的传统”。
    陈亮果真骂过皇帝吗？翻开他的《上孝宗皇帝第一书》，赫然在目的是这样的话：“陛下厉志复仇，足以对天命；笃于仁爱，足以结民心；而又仁明足以临照群臣一偏之论，此百代之英主也。”如此歌功颂德，哪里有一点点“骂”皇帝的味道呢？
    历史上的陈亮，像海瑞一样，是一个不折不扣的封建奴才。他们都是出于对封建王朝的忠心，向他们的主子出谋划策，为巩固封建统治效犬马之劳。
    侯外庐笔下的陈亮是一个假陈亮，正与吴晗笔下的海瑞是个假海瑞一样。他们都是借死人之口来发泄他们自己对党对社会主义的刻骨仇恨。他们宣扬
  “骂皇帝”是假，攻击以毛主席为首的党中央是真。
    侯外庐不仅精心炮制了一个敢“骂”皇帝的假陈亮，而且又从历史的垃圾堆里搜罗了一大批所谓敢
  “骂”皇帝的“异端”，竭力讴歌他们的“叛逆精神”，把他们打扮成“为民请命”的“英雄”。
    一九五九年四月，侯外庐抛出了《中国历代大同理想》这本恶意诋毁人民公社的黑书，别有用心地宣扬鲍敬言和邓牧“尖锐地抨击暴君与酷吏”。同年九月，侯外庐在给邓牧《伯牙琴》作序时，继续宣扬他的“骂皇帝”精神。他引用邓牧的一段话，加上重点，影射现实：“夫夺其食，不得不怒，竭其力，不得不怨。人之乱也，由夺其食；人之危也，由竭其力。而号为理民者，竭之而使危，夺之而使乱！”同时，他又吹捧明代官僚李三才敢于“批判”皇帝：“崇聚财贿，而使小民无朝夕之安”（《中国思想通史》第四卷，下册）。
    侯外庐是国内外阶级敌人的代言人。他在《中国历代大同理想》一书中，恶毒咒骂人民公社化是“立即进入共产主义的空想”；又在这里疯狂诅咒党的领导（“理民者”）给社会带来了“危”和“乱”，“使小民无朝夕之安”。这和吴晗在《海瑞骂皇帝》中说的“弄得老百姓都穷的光光的”，完全是一个调子。
    为右倾机会主义分子“罢官”鸣冤
    蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。一九五九年八月，在党的庐山会议上，一小撮右倾机会主义分子被彻底击败了。他们被党和人民罢了官，撤了职。
    右倾机会主义分子的可耻失败，引起了国内外一切反动势力的悲鸣。
    一九五九年九月，吴晗抛出《论海瑞》，叫嚣“海瑞罢职了，贼没全擒到，反而先丢官，这是海瑞所没有预料到的”。吴晗刚刚出马，侯外庐紧紧跟上。同年十月，他在苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义的御用刊物《哲学问题》上，抛出了《十六世纪中国的进步的哲学思潮概述》（见《历史研究》同年第十期），为四百年前的一个“兵部尚书”王廷相“遭受”“迫害”喊冤叫屈，胡说什么这个“兵部尚书”“对于人民具有着正义感”。侯外庐还极力渲染“东林党争”。他赞颂东林党人的“反对派”立场，对他们“政治改良运动”遭到破产失望不已，为他们“‘讽议朝政’遭到了封建专制主义的镇压”愤懑不平。
    一九六一年初，吴晗的《海瑞罢官》这株大毒草出笼之后，侯外庐就于三月九日化名“常谈”，在《北京晚报》上发表谬文，与吴晗、廖沫沙一伙称兄道弟，跟“三家村”黑帮结成死党。他极力吹捧《海瑞罢官》，并对“三家村”的反党阴谋报以会心的微笑，说什么“戏剧造型的高峰在倾向性的答案”，而他自己也要到“历史研究”中去寻求这样的“科学的结论”。他抛出《中国古代不怕鬼神的思想传统》，疯狂污蔑我们对右倾机会主义的斗争，是“一部分人把另一部分人处罚为牺牲或人肉祭品”。他赤裸裸地宣称，“我们要向那些牺牲品说：推翻祭坛，拆毁庙宇，打倒神灵！”这是同吴晗一样，公开为右倾机会主义分子打气，鼓吹他们“失败了再干”。
    五月，在“三家村”众兄弟带动下，侯外庐抛出了《汤显祖〈牡丹亭还魂记〉外传》。他别有用心地捏造汤显祖“敢于骂明神宗的糊涂昏庸”，极力宣扬“离经叛道”的反革命精神，并为汤显祖、杜甫、柳宗元的“罢官”高唱挽歌。
    七月，侯外庐又抛出《论汤显祖（紫钗记〉和〈南柯记〉的思想性》，大肆描绘一个主张“均田活民”的赵仲一被“权贵豪右”“用种种奸计陷害”“去官”，“而人民惟恐赵仲一离开他们”。同时，他又极力渲染“清官”淳于棼被罢官后“众父老卧辙坚留”而“留不住的情景”，什么“留不得！只早晚生祠中跪祝赞”。这就是侯外庐通过他所谓的“历史研究”所得出的“海父南归留不住，万家生佛把香烧”的“科学的结论”！
    八月，继吴晗提出明代一位“兵部尚书”（国防部长）于谦罢官之后，侯外庐又在《论汤显祖〈邯郸记〉的思想与风格》中，就一个“开边千里，封为定西侯，加太子太保，兼兵部尚书”的卢生大作文章。他替这个“幸进的勋贵”被“计害”“远谪南陲鬼门关外”喊冤叫屈，恶毒地咒骂说：“这正是恩之害之，反复无常。”并且幻想这个卢生式的人物，有朝一日会“被召回朝廷”做“宰相”。这和邓拓把为右倾机会主义分子
  “翻案”的希望寄托在一个“精明强干的宰相”登台夺取领导权，岂不是互相呼应的吗！
      讴歌“东林”精神，叫喊“复仇”
    一九六一年和一九六二年间，美帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义和各国反动派掀起了反华逆流，蒋介石匪帮妄图窜犯大陆。国内地、富、反、坏、右，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，妄图“变天”，推翻无产阶级专政。
    在这个阶级斗争十分尖锐的时刻，一九六一年十月五日，邓拓抛出了《事事关心》，对明末地主阶级内部的“反对派”东林党人“在政治上的抱负”赞不绝口。反革命的“风声”、“雨声”，唤起了这伙反党分子对“东林”精神的强烈共鸣。
    侯外庐这个反共老手，闻风而动。他也极力宣扬东林党人“改良现实政治”的“社会政治思想及其活动”有“积极意义”，应给予“科学的估价”。
    东林党人是一些政治上极端反动的封建士大夫，是封建统治阶级中争权夺利的狐群狗党。他们的一切政治活动，都是为了挽救朱明王朝的反动统治。
    侯外庐所津津乐道的东林党人的“积极意义”究竟是什么呢？那就是一种敢于“讽议朝政”的“骂皇帝”精神；那就是一种与“权臣抗争”，被“指为邪党”的“反对派”立场；那就是一种受到“严酷的迫害”，被罢官革职甚至“冤死狱中”的“悲剧遭遇”；那就是一种“结成团体”，“自由讲学”，“广泛地向群众散布他们的思想影响”，“用笔来砍伐世界的”“文化斗争”。所有这一切，无非是借这些历史僵尸来宣扬侯外庐之流的反革命精神。
    这些所谓“积极意义”，也就是邓拓的反革命黑诗所说的：“东林讲学继龟山，事事关心天地间。莫谓书生空议论，头颅掷处血斑斑。”侯外庐和邓拓之流，如此呕心沥血地为东林党人大唱赞歌，目的在于：激励那些右倾机会主义分子和一切牛鬼蛇神起来疯狂地反对党，反对无产阶级专政，反抗社会主义改造。
    一九六二年六月，正当蒋介石匪帮疯狂叫嚣“反攻大陆”的时候，侯外庐抛出了《傅山荀子评注手稿序言》。紧接着，他又按照反党头目周扬的意旨，抛出了《汤显祖剧作的人民性和思想性》。在这两株大毒草中，侯外庐恣意发泄他的反革命情感，狂呼“茫茫四海似无声，且把长歌代痛哭”。他以为，我们社会主义国家已经是“山河尽”了，是“要导致覆灭了”，他们卷土重来的良机已经到来了。因此，侯外庐通过吹捧封建文人傅山，向那些反共知识分子暗示：不做投降的“奴儒”，坚持反革命立场，伺机而动。
    侯外庐特别在朱之渝这个人物身上大做文章。他说什么“朱之渝看到了‘民心’的重要，指出明朝覆亡的根本原因是：缙绅
  （地主官僚）罪恶贯盈，百姓痛入骨髓：莫不有‘时日曷丧，及汝偕亡’之心。因此，他认为只要群策群力，就能取得反清斗争的胜利。……‘天下之赤子与天下之英雄豪杰，皆我襁褓之子、同气之弟，安有不合群策，毕群力，以报十七年（按指清统治年数）刺骨之深仇哉’？”这是侯外庐表白他反革命心迹的自供状。他宣称他对共产党不共戴天，有“时日曷丧，及汝偕亡”之心。这是侯外庐公开号召反革命暴乱的宣言书。他要纠集一小撮反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神，“合群策，毕群力”，向党和革命人民动刀枪，报仇雪恨。这也就是侯外庐在这一年写的方以智《东西均》序言中所表白的：“自负要提三尺剑，纠集志士，改造黑暗世界”。
    杀气腾腾！磨刀霍霍！侯外庐之流就是这样以十倍的疯狂，百倍的仇视，妄图夺回他们失去的“天堂”。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说得好：“小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁，嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。”我们有伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们的伟大国家是无产阶级的铁打江山，是任何反动势力所动摇不了的。侯外庐之流的反革命叫嚣，到头来都只不过是黄粱一梦。
                ＊　＊　＊
    事实表明，侯外庐一贯披着“专家”“学者”的外衣，干着反革命的勾当。他和邓拓、吴晗以及史学界的牛鬼蛇神早已勾结在一起，狼狈为奸，配合得十分密切。
    你看：当全中国和全世界革命人民把毛泽东思想当作自己心中最红最红的红太阳的时候，他们突然大讲其历史上的“异端”，鼓励人们“离经叛道”。离什么“经”？叛什么“道”？还不就是反对毛泽东思想。他们所一再歌颂的“异端”是什么呢？就是一“骂”二“罢”三“复仇”。当国内外阶级敌人向党向社会主义发动猖狂进攻的时候，他们就都研究起“骂皇帝”来了；当右倾机会主义分子被罢了官的时候，他们又一个接一个地抬出被罢了官的历史僵尸，大肆赞扬；当阶级敌人纷纷出笼的时候，他们这一伙又都出来提倡“东林精神”，要“复仇”，要“用笔砍伐世界”。一句话，就是要为反革命复辟制造舆论，妄图颠覆无产阶级政权，实现资本主义复辟。
    我们把侯外庐的反革命面目揭露出来，再一次说明这样一个真理：历史学是为一定的政治服务的，不是为无产阶级政治服务，就是为资产阶级政治服务。
    侯外庐、翦伯赞之流，一直反对历史学为无产阶级政治服务。他们说什么“历史学研究的是在历史上长期起作用的规律，是不能为当前的政治服务的”。但是我们所揭发出来的事实充分地说明，他们这种“理论”完全是骗人的鬼话。
    他们这套“学术要和政治分开”的谬论是骗不了人的。这些反面教员倒是给了我们一条教训，就是我们必须牢牢记住毛主席的教导：研究历史必须古为今用，历史学必须为无产阶级政治服务。当前，我们就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把史学界的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把侯外庐之流的反革命修正主义分子一个个揪出来，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！
