The Asian Committee of the New Emerging Forces Games held its plenary meeting today to celebrate the successful holding of the Asian New Games.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Phnom Penh on the 23rd, the plenary meeting of the Asian Committee of the New Emerging Forces Games opened this morning in Phnom Penh.

Prime Minister Lon Nol of the Royal Government of Cambodia attended the opening ceremony and delivered a speech.

The stage was adorned with the emblem of the Asian New Emerging Forces Games and the flags of the seventeen countries and regions participating in the first Asian New Emerging Forces Games.

Eleven countries and regions sent representatives and observers to attend today's opening ceremony, including Cambodia, Ceylon, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Mongolia, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Yemen.

The chairman of the New Emerging Forces Games Federation, Maladi, also attended the meeting.

In his speech, Lon Nol pointed out that at a time when imperialism and neo-colonialism are making their last-ditch efforts to restore their rule in various places, it is of great significance to strengthen the relations between the countries that oppose this rule to thwart the shameful and outdated policies.

Lon Nol continued, "The recent sanctions imposed by the Olympic Committee on some countries clearly show that the imperialists are trying to sabotage our efforts to successfully hold the first Asian New Games."

He said, "Therefore, for the peoples of the countries that uphold justice, love peace, freedom, and independence, it is an urgent duty to strengthen unity to confront the pressing threats and overcome all attacks by the imperialists and neo-colonialists."

Dipan, the chairman of the Cambodian National Organizing Committee for the first Asian New Games, spoke first at the opening ceremony.

He said: The New Emerging Forces Games are determined to uphold the spirit of unity to smash all attempts by imperialism and neo-colonialism to realize their sinister plans to rebuild their unjust rule in various parts of the world.

Huang Zhong, the acting chairman of the Asian Committee of the New Games, then spoke. He said that the first Asian New Games, which are about to open, are the first sports event held by the Asian people to break free from the shackles of imperialism. This event is not only a grand review of the achievements in sports by the peoples of various Asian countries but also a grand demonstration by the Asian people against U.S. imperialism.

He said: "This event is held in Cambodia, which has a glorious anti-imperialist tradition, and therefore has special significance." He warmly praised the Cambodian people, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, for their unyielding struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and for their remarkable achievements in developing their national economy and culture with a spirit of self-reliance and self-improvement, as well as for their outstanding organizational work for the successful holding of this event.

Huang Zhong went on to point out that the current international situation and the anti-imperialist struggle in the international sports arena are both in a very good shape.

He said, the development of the New Games in Asia has aroused extreme hostility and fear from U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Under the instigation of the International Olympic Committee, which is manipulated by U.S. imperialism, some reactionary international sports organizations have resorted to their usual tricks of "sanctions" and "suspension of membership" in an attempt to obstruct the participation of Asian countries in the first Asian New Games. The successful holding of the first Asian New Games is a powerful rebuke to the imperialist policy of the big stick, proving that the dignity of the Asian people is inviolable, and proving that the anti-imperialist struggle on the sports front has become an irresistible tide.

Huang Zhong went on to say, "The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, said: 'The oppressed peoples and nations can never entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in the struggle.' The development process of the New Emerging Forces sports has fully proved this. Now, more and more people have come to realize that unity against imperialism and independence and self-reliance are the only correct paths for the peoples of all countries to develop their sports."

    开好亚洲新运会　加强团结反美帝
    新运会亚洲委员会举行全体会议欢呼亚新会的胜利举行
    据新华社金边二十三日电　新兴力量运动会亚洲委员会全体大会今天上午在金边开幕。
    柬埔寨王国政府首相朗诺出席了开幕仪式并发表了讲话。
    主席台上挂着亚洲新兴力量运动会的会徽和参加第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会的十七个国家和地区的旗帜。
    出席今天开幕仪式的有十一个国家和地区的代表和观察员，其中包括柬埔寨、锡兰、中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、印度尼西亚、日本、老挝、蒙古、越南民主共和国、也门等。
    新兴力量运动会联合会主席马拉迪也出席了会议。
    朗诺首相在讲话中指出，在帝国主义和新殖民主义企图在各地恢复它们统治而进行垂死挣扎的今天，加强那些反对这种统治的国家之间的关系，对挫败可耻和过时的政策是有重要意义的。
    朗诺接着说，奥林匹克委员会最近对一些国家所采取的制裁手段，清楚地表明，帝国主义者企图破坏我们为开好第一届亚洲新运会所作出的努力。
    他说，“因此，对于主持正义、爱好和平、自由和独立的各国人民来说，加强团结来对付咄咄逼人的威胁和战胜帝国主义者和新殖民主义者的一切进攻，这是一项紧迫义务。”
    第一届亚洲新运会柬埔寨全国组织委员会主席狄潘在开幕式上首先讲话。
    他说：新兴力量运动决心要贯彻团结精神，以便粉碎帝国主义和新殖民主义为实现它们在世界各地重建它们的非正义统治的阴险计划的一切企图。
    新运会亚洲委员会代理主席黄中接着讲话。他说，即将开幕的第一届亚洲新运会，是亚洲人民摆脱帝国主义的羁绊而举行的第一次运动会。这届运动会不但是亚洲各国人民体育事业成就的一次大检阅，而且是亚洲人民反对美帝国主义的一次大示威。
    他说：“这次运动会是在具有光荣反帝传统的柬埔寨举行的，因而具有特殊的意义”。他热烈赞扬了柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王的领导下，为反对美帝国主义及其仆从的侵略而进行的不屈不挠的斗争，和在以奋发图强、自力更生的精神发展自己的民族经济和文化方面取得的显著成绩，以及为这届运动会的成功举行而进行的杰出的组织工作。
    黄中接着指出，目前国际形势和国际体育领域中的反帝斗争都呈现一派大好形势。
    他说，新运会事业在亚洲的不断发展，引起了美帝国主义及其走狗的极端仇视和恐惧。在美帝国主义操纵的国际奥委会的唆使下，一些反动国际体育组织，施展“制裁”、“停止会籍处分”的惯伎，妄图阻挠亚洲各国参加第一届亚洲新运会。第一届亚洲新运会的胜利举行，是对帝国主义大棒政策的有力回击，证明亚洲人民的尊严不可侮，证明体育战线上的反帝斗争已经成为一股不可抗拒的洪流。
    黄中接着说，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席说：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”新兴力量体育事业的发展过程，充分证明了这一点。现在，越来越多的人认识到：团结反帝、独立自主是世界各国人民发展体育事业唯一正确的道路。
