Saving Class Brothers is My Responsibility

By Wang Yingzhou, Platoon Leader of a Certain Unit in the People's Liberation Army

In the winter of 1964 during a field exercise, one morning I led the entire platoon in a tactical assessment. Just as the fourth squad was charging, an "enemy" pillbox suddenly opened fire, blocking their path forward. Soldier Deng Benduan immediately went to detonate the explosives. He had just stuffed the explosive package into the pillbox's opening, and it hadn't yet exploded, when the "enemy" fled. The squad leader immediately ordered the squad to pursue. The machine gunner, Zuo Yulin, caught up from behind and used the pillbox to set up his gun and provide cover fire for the squad's advance. His body was only about a meter away from the explosive package that was about to detonate. The explosive package was smoking, and it was about to explode. I was standing about ten meters away and, together with the comrades, shouted loudly: "Zuo Yulin, get away! Get away!" Zuo Yulin was concentrating on "fighting" and didn't hear what everyone was shouting. Seeing that my class brother's life was in grave danger, I dashed over to the pillbox in a few steps, used my left hand to pull him behind my back, and with my right hand grabbed the explosive package and threw it into the ditch. The explosive package hadn't been thrown out yet when it exploded in my hand. When I came to from my faint, I found out that my right hand had been blown off, and my right side was injured. Since Zuo Yulin was not injured, I was at ease.

Later, someone asked me what I was thinking when I rushed forward. I replied: At that moment, I had only one thought, which was to save my class brother!

This thought did not come about by chance; it was the result of being educated by Mao Zedong Thought.

In 1960, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," where Chairman Mao said:

"Our entire army, with all its fighters and workers and commanders, unites as one man. He has a spirit, and that is the spirit of selflessness. He is going all out, sparing nothing, and striving to win victory in the war of resistance. This spirit is expressed in his slogan, 'Serve the people!'"

I thought, as a cadre, to serve the people wholeheartedly, the most direct way for me is to serve the soldiers. Our soldiers are the outstanding children of the workers and peasants, the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and my class brothers. Caring for and loving them is the duty of a Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre that cannot be shirked. Moreover, to make a revolution, one must pay a certain price, so revolutionary soldiers must not be afraid of death. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "To struggle means to advance wave upon wave under the fire of the enemy, to advance unswervingly despite all obstacles and hardships, to courageously face death and to be indifferent to the shedding of blood. This is the essence of struggle." During the War of Liberation, Dong Cunrui sacrificed himself to blow up the fortress. On the battlefield of Korea, Huang Jiguang used his chest to block the enemy's gun port. I have also seen with my own eyes that my fellow soldiers in the same platoon, in the heat of battle, sacrificed their lives to save their comrades. These good comrades died for the people and died a worthy death. Their heroic images have always been deeply engraved in my mind. This time, I was able to rush forward to save my comrades, precisely because, under the education of Mao Zedong Thought and inspired by the great images of these heroes, I did what I should have done.

    抢救阶级兄弟是我的责任
    解放军某部连长　王英洲
    一九六四年冬季野营，有一天上午，我领着全连进行战术考核。正当四班冲击的时候，一个“敌人”的地堡突然开火了，堵住了他们前进的通路。战士邓本端立即去爆破，刚把炸药包塞进地堡眼，还没爆炸，“敌人”就逃跑了。四班长马上指挥全班追击。机枪手左玉林从后面赶上来，就利用地堡架枪射击，掩护全班前进。他的身子离那个即将爆炸的炸药包只有一米左右。炸药包直冒白烟，很快就要爆炸。我站在离他约十米远的地方，和同志们一起大声呼喊：“左玉林快离开！快离开！”左玉林正集中精力“打仗”，没听清大家喊的是啥。眼看阶级兄弟的生命十分危险，我就几个箭步蹿到地堡跟前，用左手把他拉到我的背后，用右手抓起炸药包，往沟里摔。炸药包还没有摔出去，就在手上爆炸了。我从昏迷中醒来的时候，才知道右手已经炸断了，身体右侧受了伤。左玉林没有受伤，我就放心了。
    事后，有人问我冲上去的时候想了些什么？我回答说：那时我只有一个念头，就是要把阶级兄弟救出来！
    这个念头不是偶然产生的，是毛泽东思想教育我的结果。
    一九六○年，我学习《为人民服务》，毛主席说：
  “我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我想，自己是个干部，完全、彻底地为人民服务，对我来说，最直接的就是为战士服务。我们的战士，是工农群众的优秀子弟，是无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是我的阶级兄弟，关心爱护他们，正是一个共产党员和革命干部义不容辞的责任。再说，干革命，总要付出一定的代价，因此革命战士就不能怕死。毛主席早就指出过：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，……我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”解放战争中，董存瑞舍身炸碉堡。朝鲜战场上，黄继光用自己的胸膛堵住敌人枪眼。我还亲眼看到同连的战友，在战斗中为了抢救同志，牺牲了自己的生命。这些好同志就是为人民而死，死得其所。他们的英雄形象一直深深地刻在我的脑子里。我这回能冲上去抢救自己的战友，正是在毛泽东思想的教育下，在英雄们伟大形象鼓舞下，做了一件自己应该做的事情。
