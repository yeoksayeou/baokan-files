The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, in an attempt to curry favor with the Japanese reactionaries and to counter the influence of the Chinese economic and trade exhibition, recently held an industrial and commercial exhibition in Osaka. The exhibition reeked of the decadent stench of capitalism and was met with contempt by the Japanese people, ultimately ending in a cold and desolate manner.

High-ranking officials groveling

The Soviet government specially dispatched a large delegation led by Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Yasnov, to oversee the exhibition. Yasnov also brought a congratulatory message from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Kosygin, for the opening of the exhibition. In the message, Kosygin humbly expressed his hope that the exhibition would further promote relations between the Soviet government and the Sato government.

However, the Sato government was not impressed by the Soviet revisionist leadership's groveling attitude. According to Japanese newspapers, the Soviet government informed the Japanese reactionaries that Yasnov was a "big shot" second only to Kosygin. Yet, the Sato government considered him merely an ordinary official equivalent to an assistant to the Osaka prefectural governor and thus could only receive him as a "guest of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs." Despite this humiliation, Yasnov continued to grovel before the Sato government, displaying his shameful behavior.

Low tactics to attract visitors

The Soviet revisionist leadership, in an attempt to attract visitors, shamelessly sent a group of female fashion models to the exhibition. They danced provocatively to jazz music, flaunting their bodies. These female fashion models belonged to the largest clothing company in Leningrad. The manager of this company shamelessly told Japanese reporters, "We are not imitating capitalist countries; rather, we are demonstrating that our country is reaching international standards in the field of modeling."

The responsible officials of the Soviet exhibition also had these models wear various bizarre costumes to perform on Japanese television. Japanese yellow press reporters eagerly photographed their various shameful acts and published them in magazines.

As with their behavior in exhibitions in other countries around the world, the Soviet revisionists believed that using such vulgar and decadent capitalist methods could attract a large number of visitors. However, the broad masses of the Japanese people were extremely indignant at this practice. Only some wealthy youngsters and hoodlums enthusiastically cheered for them.

The sabotage plot completely failed

The Soviet revisionists deliberately scheduled this exhibition to be held shortly after the opening of the Chinese economic and trade exhibition in Kitakyushu, in an attempt to collude with Japanese reactionaries and new and old followers of Soviet revisionism to sabotage the Chinese exhibition and to counter the influence of great Mao Zedong Thought and socialist China. However, their plot completely failed. The Chinese exhibition attracted over 1.5 million visitors and was warmly praised by the Japanese people, while the number of visitors to the Soviet industrial and commercial exhibition, according to their own boastful figures, was only 350,000.

The counter-revolutionary nature exposed

Visitors to the Osaka exhibition said: This Soviet exhibition is a good negative example. People can see from it how far the Soviet revisionists have fallen. They have long since surrendered to capitalism and become accomplices of U.S. imperialism. A housewife who happened to see the Soviet fashion models performing on television immediately turned off the TV and angrily said, "The Soviet revisionists have defiled socialism, defiled Lenin, and defiled Stalin."

    散发资本主义臭气　暴露工贼叛徒嘴脸
    苏修在日本搞展览会丑态百出
    广大人民加以鄙弃　阿飞流氓使劲捧场
    据新华社讯　东京消息：苏联修正主义领导集团为了拉拢日本反动派和妄图抵销中国经济贸易展览会的影响，最近在大阪举行了一个工商业展览会，它散发出浓厚的资本主义的腐朽气息，受到日本人民的鄙视，冷冷清清地收了场。
  要员出马卑躬屈膝
    苏联政府特意派出以俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国部长会议副主席雅斯诺夫为首的一个庞大的代表团来主持这个展览会。雅斯诺夫还特地带去了苏联部长会议主席柯西金祝贺展览会开幕的贺词。柯西金在贺词中低声下气地表示希望通过这次展览会来进一步促进苏联政府和佐藤政府的关系。
    但是，佐藤政府对苏联现代修正主义领导集团，摆出的低声下气的讨好姿态并不欣赏。据日本报纸透露，苏联政府向日本反动派表示，雅斯诺夫是仅次于柯西金的“大人物”。可是佐藤政府却认为他只不过是相当于大阪府知事助手的普通官员，因此不能给予“政府贵宾”的待遇，只能按“外务省客人”的待遇来接待他。在这种羞辱的情况下，雅斯诺夫仍然对佐藤政府卑躬屈膝，丑态百出。
  招揽观众手段下流
    苏联现代修正主义领导集团为了吸引观众，不知羞耻地派来一批女时装表演员，在展览会上按着爵士音乐的节拍，大肆扭摆身躯，卖弄风骚。这些女时装表演员属于列宁格勒的一家最大的服装公司，这家公司的经理不以为耻地向日本记者说：“我们不是模仿资本主义国家，而是为了说明我国在模特儿的领域，正在达到国际水平。”
    苏联展览会的负责人还让这些女模特儿穿着各种奇装异服到日本电视台表演。日本的黄色杂志记者纷纷把她们的各种丑态，拍成照片，登在杂志上。
    也同在世界其它各国举行展览会时所作所为一样，苏联现代修正主义者以为用这种资本主义庸俗腐朽的手法，可以吸引大批观众，但是广大的日本人民群众对这种做法表示非常愤慨。只有一些富家子弟和流氓阿飞使劲地为它捧场。
  破坏阴谋彻底破产
    苏联现代修正主义者别有用心地把这个展览会，安排在北九州的中国经济贸易展览会开幕后不久举行，妄图配合日本反动派和苏联修正主义的新旧追随者破坏中国展览会的阴谋，妄图抵销伟大的毛泽东思想和社会主义中国的影响。但是他们的企图彻底破产了。中国的展览会有一百五十多万人参观，受到日本人民的热烈赞扬，而苏联工商业展览会的观众，据他们自己吹嘘的数字也只有三十五万人。
  反面教员原形毕露
    大阪的观众说：这个苏联展览会是一个很好的反面教员，人们可以从那里看到苏联现代修正主义者已经堕落到何等地步。他们早就向资本主义投降，成了美帝国主义的帮凶。有一位家庭主妇在电视中偶然看见苏联的女时装表演员正在卖弄丑态，她马上关掉电视机，气愤地说：“苏联现代修正主义者玷污了社会主义，玷污了列宁和斯大林。”
