For the celebration of the 22nd anniversary of Albania's liberation, the workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau held a grand meeting this evening.

The delegation led by Comrade P. Doda, Chairman of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, and the acting charge d'affaires of the Albanian Embassy in China, Comrade Melechi Babani, were invited to join the workers in celebrating the festival. When the Albanian comrades arrived at the venue, the workers lined up on both sides to welcome them, holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically cheering, "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong."

The celebration began with all the workers reciting the following passage from Chairman Mao's message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party:

"'Though we are far apart, our hearts are close.' The two countries of China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but our hearts are united. We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades.

"We are not the kind of friends who are sweet-tongued but treacherous. We are not two-faced. The revolutionary and fighting friendship between us has withstood the test of storms and tempests."

Representative Cai Lianxing of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot spoke at the meeting. He enthusiastically praised the heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Labor Party, for achieving great victories in the socialist revolution and construction.

Comrade P. Doda, in his speech, conveyed the revolutionary greetings of the Albanian people and Comrade Enver Hoxha. He said that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great leader, the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, and the most beloved and greatest friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved great successes in all fields, and the Albanian people are extremely happy about this. He also enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, which has already achieved great victories.

Comrade P. Doda, Chairman of the delegation, presented a banner inscribed with "Long Live Albanian-Chinese Fighting Friendship" to the locomotive depot.
