Wide masses of militia on various fronts are launching activities to learn from Cai Yongxiang. They are studying Chairman Mao Zedong's thought to become good militia members who are dedicated to public service. They never forget class struggle and are highly vigilant against the sabotage plots of class enemies.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 23rd, militia members across the country have decided to learn from Cai Yongxiang. They will arm themselves thoroughly with the invincible great thought of Chairman Mao Zedong. With one hand holding production tools and the other holding guns, they will stand at the forefront of class struggle and production struggle. They will become good militia members like Cai Yongxiang, dedicated to public service, and defend and build the iron mountains and rivers of the proletariat.

Militia members in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces have responded to the call from the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army. They have held report meetings and discussion meetings, and launched propaganda and learning activities about Cai Yongxiang. Militia members in Jilin, Guangxi, and Gansu provinces have also organized performance programs and formed propaganda teams. They have gone to village heads and fields to sing praises of the hero and learn from the hero together with community members.

Militia members have deeply realized from Cai Yongxiang's rapid growth into a communist warrior that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to transform one's worldview is the fundamental path to becoming revolutionary. All militia members in the Hero Militia Camp of Liuzhuang, Henan Province, have held multiple meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works during the activities to learn from Cai Yongxiang. Militia members at the meetings have expressed their determination to build the militia camp into a true iron wall with Mao Zedong thought, to turn the militia organization into a big school of Mao Zedong thought, and to be ready to fight and win at any time. Huang Wangyou, one of the famous "Little Red Guards," is now the deputy commander of the militia camp in Hezu Village, Xiamen Frontline Commune, Fujian Province. He said excitedly: I will take Cai Yongxiang as my example, eliminate selfishness and establish public service, and farm for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

Militia members across the country have, according to the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "On Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production Again," directed the revolutionary enthusiasm inspired by learning from Cai Yongxiang into production. Cao Huzi, the leader of the rapid excavation team at Hanqiao Coal Mine in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, has expressed his determination to learn from Cai Yongxiang's loyalty to the revolutionary cause. He will guard his production post, seize the revolution, and promote production, and complete and overfulfill the coal mining plan more quickly, better, and more economically. The advanced model unit in Dazhai style on Hainan Island, Shihu Village, has revised its plan for winter and spring trial fields and launched a wave of fertilizer preparation and plowing.

Militia members, especially those on the frontlines of Fujian and the South China Sea, have said after learning from Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds: We must never forget class struggle and be highly vigilant against the sabotage activities of class enemies. Militia members in Wengtian Commune, Hainan Island, who once captured the American spy Smith, have said: We will learn from Comrade Cai Yongxiang's revolutionary spirit and be ready at any time to annihilate the imperialist aggressors in the vast ocean of people's war.

    广大民兵从蔡永祥迅速成长为共产主义战士的事实中，深刻地认识到，活学活用毛主席著作，改造自己的世界观，是实现革命化的根本道路。河南省留庄英雄民兵营的全体民兵，在开展学习蔡永祥的活动中，举行了多次活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，民兵们在会上纷纷表示：要用毛泽东思想把民兵营建设成为真正的铜墙铁壁，把民兵组织办成毛泽东思想大学校，做到召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜。全国闻名的“英雄小八路”之一黄网友，现在是福建省厦门前线公社何厝大队民兵营的副营长，他激动地说：我要以蔡永祥为榜样，破私立公，为中国革命和世界革命种田。
    各地民兵，纷纷根据《人民日报》社论《再论抓革命促生产》的精神，把学习蔡永祥所焕发出来的革命干劲，用到生产中去。江苏省徐州韩桥煤矿快速掘进组组长曹虎子表示，一定要学习蔡永祥忠于革命事业的精神，坚守生产岗位，抓革命促生产，更加多快好省地完成和超额完成采煤计划。海南岛大寨式先进典型单位石屋大队的民兵修订了今冬明春种试验田的计划，掀起了积肥备耕高潮。
