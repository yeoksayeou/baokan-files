“Though we are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are united.” The People’s Republic of China and the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria are far apart, but our hearts are connected. We are your genuine friends and comrades. You are also our genuine friends and comrades. We are not the kind of false friends who are sweet-talking but treacherous. We are not two-faced. The revolutionary and fighting friendship between us has withstood the test of storms and tempests.

    毛主席语录
    “海内存知己，天涯若比邻”。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。
