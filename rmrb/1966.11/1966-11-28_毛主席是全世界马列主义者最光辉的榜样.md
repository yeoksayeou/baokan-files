The masses of soldiers and civilians across the country sing praises for the great leader's unprecedented initiative to meet with millions of revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao is the shining example for Marxist-Leninists worldwide. The leader loves the people, and the people love the leader. Our most beloved leader is forever united with the people's hearts. We must learn from, learn from, and learn again from the world's greatest proletarian revolutionary, Chairman Mao, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's correct line. We must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th, the news of our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao's eighth meeting with revolutionary youngsters has spread, and revolutionary people of all ethnic groups across the country have unanimously praised the greatest proletarian revolutionary, Chairman Mao, and the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. From cities to villages, from the interior to the borders, across the land of our motherland, the shout of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand long live Chairman Mao!" resonates everywhere. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to advance victoriously, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has shaken the country and the world, through to the end.

From August of this year to now, in just over three months, Chairman Mao has reviewed more than 11 million cultural revolution troops. This is an unprecedented great initiative in the history of the Chinese proletarian revolution and the international communist movement. Broad masses of revolutionaries excitedly say: Chairman Mao's repeated meetings have given us the greatest support and encouragement, driving the tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution higher and higher, surging forward. Chairman Mao's meeting in early spring is a summary of the victories of revolutionary teachers and students in the past three months of revolutionary linkage and study, and it is also a new battle mobilization. With hearts filled with boundless love, loyalty, and faith in Chairman Mao, they express: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the brightest red sun in our hearts! Only you have such great courage and determination to launch such an unprecedented great revolutionary mass movement. Your heart is forever united with the hearts of the revolutionary masses. We will always follow your words. Wherever you point, we will charge ahead. Nothing can stop us, not even mountains of knives and seas of fire. Our hearts will remain unchanged for ten thousand generations.

Revolutionary youngsters across the country who have been received by the great leader Chairman Mao are extremely excited today, saying that three months ago, Chairman Mao called on us: "You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Now, this great call has become the revolutionary actions of hundreds of millions of people, and the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is getting better and better. Chairman Mao's repeated meetings with us have made us clear about the direction of the revolution at critical moments, enhanced our revolutionary courage, strengthened our revolutionary faith, and continuously expanded the revolutionary ranks. Chairman Mao is our closest and dearest relative. We will forever be loyal red guards of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary youngsters in Tianjin say: We must remember the happiness and encouragement Chairman Mao has given us in his repeated meetings for life, forever maintain our revolutionary vigor, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Revolutionary youngsters from a Red Guard combat team in Hohhot say: When we encounter difficulties in our struggle, it is Chairman Mao who gives us the greatest courage and strength; when we face opposition in going out for revolutionary linkage, it is Chairman Mao who gives us the greatest support and encouragement. With Chairman Mao leading us, no matter how great the difficulties in the revolutionary road, we can overcome them.

Some revolutionary teachers and students from outside Shanghai, who are currently linking up in Shanghai, were in a state of great excitement, joy, and emotion when they heard the news of Chairman Mao's eighth meeting with revolutionary youngsters while visiting the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China in the evening of the 26th. Revolutionary teachers and students from Beijing, Xinjiang, and Guangdong said: We swear: We will always take Chairman Mao's words as the highest directive for our actions, always follow Chairman Mao's words, pay attention to national affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! We will always follow Chairman Mao's teachings in the "Three Articles" to eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, and strive to revolutionize our thoughts. Many revolutionary youngsters who traveled on foot for linkage were excited to express: We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, learn from the PLA, learn from the workers and peasants, and take the road of integrating with the masses of workers and peasants to temper ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Chairman Mao's meeting with revolutionary youngsters has brought the greatest encouragement and happiness to the main force of revolution and production— the masses of workers and peasants. The broad masses of workers and peasants are determined to turn the encouragement they have received into the power to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, into the power to seize the revolution and promote production, and into the power to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. Workers in many places have written poems and big-character posters to express their determination, saying: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We love you from the bottom of our hearts. We will definitely follow your words, pay attention to national affairs, seize the revolution and promote production, and use the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to change our worldview, like the communist warrior Cai Yongxiang, firmly guard our posts, and resolutely achieve double victories in revolution and production. The Iron Man of Daqing, Wang Jinxi, excitedly said: The leader loves the people, and the people love the leader, shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart. Chairman Mao's repeated meetings with the Red Guards across the country are the glory of Daqing, the glory of all oil workers and the people of the whole country. Chairman Mao always thinks of the 700 million Chinese people and the several billion people of the world. We oil workers must take the great leader Chairman Mao as our example, think of the people of the whole country and the world, produce as much oil as the revolution needs, support socialist construction, and support the struggle of the revolutionary people of the world. Famous labor model, engineer Wang Feng'en from Shenyang Transformer Factory, excitedly said: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently, seize the revolution, promote production, and treat the factory as a battlefield against imperialism and revisionism. We are determined to contribute our greatest strength to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Workers of the Tibetan road maintenance team on the frozen, 5,000-meter-high Tanggula Mountain all expressed: We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote production, determine to fight the cold and snow, and definitely maintain the road well.

The good news flew over thousands of mountains and rivers to reach the vast rural areas of our country. Male and female community members who are currently harvesting, winter sowing, repairing water conservancy projects, and carrying out agricultural basic construction in the fields are holding meetings and singing "The East Is Red" and "The Ship of the Great Sea Depends on the Helmsman," shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" Many community members read the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in the fields and by the roadsides, expressing their boundless love, loyalty, and faith in Chairman Mao. Community members of the Dazhai Brigade in Shanxi Province said: Chairman Mao's words are worth a thousand words, each sentence is a treasure, one sentence is worth ten thousand. In the past, we followed Chairman Mao's words, defeated imperialism, eliminated feudal exploitation, and embarked on the happy road of socialism; in the future, we will forever follow Chairman Mao's words, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and turn Dazhai into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionary cadres across the country were greatly encouraged upon hearing the news of Chairman Mao reviewing revolutionary youngsters. They reviewed Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings: "You must put politics in command, go to the masses, stay with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." They expressed their determination to always put proletarian politics first, go to the masses, and share their fate with the masses. They said: Only a great leader like Chairman Mao, a great proletarian revolutionary, can trust the masses, care for the masses, and support the masses. Chairman Mao is our shining example. We must learn from, learn from, and learn again from the great leader Chairman Mao.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th, "In the history of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement, who has met with millions of revolutionary masses in such a short time? Only our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao! Who is the greatest proletarian revolutionary in the world? It is our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!" The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA Army, Navy, and Air Force, with hearts filled with boundless happiness, excitement, and emotion, enthusiastically cheered for Chairman Mao's eighth meeting with the cultural revolutionary army and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They unanimously expressed: We will always closely follow the highest commander Chairman Mao, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's correct line, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better, and achieve new and greater victories.

Naval, air force, and military units in Beijing, Nanjing, Shenyang, Kunming, Jinan, Chengdu, and many other places held discussions this morning after listening to the broadcast. The soldiers and officers excitedly said: Our beloved great leader Chairman Mao has continuously met with more than 11 million revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from all over the country and the capital for eight times. This is an unprecedented great revolutionary initiative in the history of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement. This most powerfully shows that Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the masses' revolutionary actions the most, always with his heart united with the masses. Chairman Mao has set the most shining example for us with his great revolutionary practice, and at the same time, he has set the most shining example for Marxist-Leninists around the world. Soldiers and officers of a certain company of the Shenyang Army guarding a certain island on the front line of the Yellow Sea, upon hearing the good news, each held a shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read in unison: "The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history." Soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the border defense force stationed on the southwestern border of the motherland again studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who truly support the revolution." The soldiers and officers said: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, what attitude and stance to take towards the masses is the dividing line between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line. Chairman Mao, despite the cold, met with revolutionary masses for two consecutive days for the eighth time, personally guiding the cultural revolutionary army to victory. This most fully shows that Chairman Mao is the great leader we love, admire, and worship the most, and the greatest proletarian revolutionary in the world. We will remember Chairman Mao's great teachings when we make the revolution, always believe in the masses, rely on the masses, never leave the masses for a moment, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Representatives of the active members of the Navy South Sea Fleet studying Chairman Mao's works unanimously believed that Chairman Mao's greatest support, care, and encouragement for the broad revolutionary masses are the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The marching team of a certain air force school, which recently set out from Beijing for a marching linkage after being received by Chairman Mao, held a discussion upon hearing the good news of Chairman Mao's eighth meeting with revolutionary masses and Red Guards in Kaifeng. They said: Since we left Beijing for the Long March, we have heard the good news of our great leader Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards three times. Each time, it brought us back to the happy moment of seeing Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's heart is tightly united with ours. As soon as we think of Chairman Mao, we are full of strength, overcoming one difficulty after another on the Long March. We will definitely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao to the end and always follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution.

"Chairman Mao opens the Long March road, revolutionary youngsters follow, striding forward on the Long March road, golden rails to the new world of communism." Many soldiers and officers were excited to hear that among the Red Guards who accepted Chairman Mao's review this time, many had marched all the way from all over the country to Beijing. They enthusiastically praised and supported the Red Guards' all-the-way marching linkage as a good way to temper themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Soldiers and officers of the 6th Company of a certain Yi ethnic minority team, an advanced unit for studying Chairman Mao's works in the Chengdu Army, stationed on the Daliang Mountains, have recently warmly received the Red Guard Long March team three times. The revolutionary spirit and will of the Red Guards have deeply educated them. The soldiers and officers said: Under the support and encouragement of Chairman Mao, the Red Guard youngsters responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to march all the way, go to the storms and waves to temper themselves, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and temper themselves into good successors of the revolution, red successors. Today's Red Guards are the future workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the future, we will hand over the gun to such class brothers, to class brothers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and have gone through hardships and tribulations in the storms and waves. We are one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand times at ease. We are happy to have such revolutionary successors. Soldiers and officers of a certain communication unit stationed by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway specially set up a propaganda and mobilization station by the roadside to receive the Red Guard Long March team marching to Jinggangshan. This morning, after hearing the good news of Chairman Mao's eighth meeting with revolutionary youngsters, they immediately held a celebration meeting and discussion with more than 400 Red Guard Long March youngsters from Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang who were marching towards Jinggangshan. The soldiers and officers expressed their resolute support for the Red Guard youngsters' revolutionary linkage march, humbly learned from the revolutionary will and spirit of the Red Guard youngsters, and always advanced bravely in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Comrade Li Bude, a political commissar of a certain unit of the Jinan Army who participated in the 25,000-li Long March, said: In the past, Chairman Mao led the Red Army on the Long March and declared to the world that the Chinese revolution would definitely be victorious. Today, the Red Guards' Long March again declares to the world that we will firmly follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao to the end, all the way to communism.

Soldiers and officers of military units in Guangzhou, Lanzhou, Wuhan, Fuzhou, and military regions in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet, as well as the Railway Corps, Engineering Corps, and Communication Corps, unanimously believed in discussions: The increasingly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has put new and higher demands on us; only by resolutely following Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, better studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, taking the "Three Articles" as our motto, carrying out the struggle to eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, and establishing a communist worldview, can we keep up with the rapidly developing revolutionary situation.

The five-star red flag flutters in the wind, and a red sun rises in the east. Chairman Mao! You are the red sun in our hearts! You are the greatest proletarian revolutionary in the world. Only you, such a great Marxist-Leninist, only you, such a great genius, have such great courage and determination to launch this great revolutionary mass movement that shakes the world. You have set the most shining example for Marxist-Leninists around the world and for our young generation.

    毛主席是全世界马列主义者最光辉的榜样
    领袖爱人民，人民爱领袖，我们最敬爱的领袖永远和人民心连心。我们一定要向世界上最伟大的无产阶级革命家毛主席学习、学习、再学习，坚决执行毛主席的正确路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    据新华社二十七日讯　我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席第八次接见革命小将的喜讯传出，全国各地各族革命人民同声歌颂最伟大的无产阶级革命家毛主席，歌颂以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。从城市到乡村，从内地到边疆，在祖国的大地上，到处响起了“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声。亿万革命群众决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗乘胜前进，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把震撼全国和全世界的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    从今年八月到现在短短三个多月时间，毛主席先后检阅了一千一百多万文化革命大军，这是中国无产阶级革命和国际共产主义运动史上前所未有的伟大创举。广大革命群众激动地说：毛主席一次又一次的接见，给了我们最大的支持，最大的鼓舞，推动着无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，一浪高一浪，汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前。毛主席在明年春暖前的最后一次接见，是对三个多月来革命师生进行革命串连和学习的胜利总结，也是一个新的战斗动员。他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰的心情表示：毛主席呵，毛主席！您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳！只有您才有这样巨大的魄力和决心，发动这样一场史无前例的伟大的革命群众运动，您的心永远和革命群众的心紧紧连在一起。我们永远听您的话，您指到哪里，我们就冲到哪里，刀山火海挡不住，千年万代不变心。
    遍布全国的受到伟大领袖毛主席接见的千百万革命小将，今天无比振奋地说，三个多月前，毛主席号召我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”现在，这一伟大号召已变成亿万群众的革命行动，无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好。毛主席连续接见我们，使我们在斗争的关键时刻，明确了革命的方向，提高了革命的勇气，坚定了革命的信心，不断壮大了革命的队伍，毛主席是我们最亲最亲的亲人，我们要永远做忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想的红小兵。天津的革命小将说，我们一定要把毛主席历次接见给我们的幸福和鼓励，一辈子铭记心中，永远保持旺盛的革命朝气，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。呼和浩特市一支红卫兵战斗队的小将们说，当我们在斗争中遇到困难的时候，是毛主席给了我们最大的勇气和力量；当我们要外出串连遭到反对的时候，是毛主席给了我们最大的支持和鼓舞。有毛主席领导我们，在革命的大路上，天大的困难也能克服。
    正在上海串连的一些外地革命师生，二十六日傍晚瞻仰中国共产党第一次全国代表大会的会址的时候，听到了毛主席第八次接见革命小将的喜讯，一直沉浸在无比兴奋、欢乐、激动之中。来自北京、新疆、广东的革命师生说，我们宣誓：永远要把毛主席的话当作自己行动的最高指示，永远听毛主席的话，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！永远遵循毛主席的“老三篇”对我们的教导，破私立公，努力使自己思想革命化。许多徒步串连的革命小将听到喜讯后，激动地表示：坚决听毛主席的话，向解放军学习，向工农学习，走和工农群众相结合的道路，把自己锻炼成为可靠的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    毛主席接见革命小将给革命和生产建设的主力军——工农群众带来最大鼓舞、最大幸福。广大工农群众决心把受到的鼓舞化为更加刻苦活学活用毛主席著作的动力，化为抓革命促生产的动力，化为彻底批判资产阶级反动路线的动力。各地许多工人写诗、写大字报表决心说：毛主席啊，毛主席！我们从心眼里敬爱您，我们一定听您的话，关心国家大事，抓革命促生产，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神改造世界观，像共产主义战士蔡永祥那样，坚守岗位，坚决做到革命生产双胜利。大庆铁人王进喜激动地说，领袖爱人民，人民爱领袖，肩并肩，心连心。毛主席一次又一次接见全国的红卫兵，这是大庆人的光荣，全体石油工人和全国人民的光荣。毛主席时刻为七亿中国人民着想，为全世界几十亿人民着想，我们石油工人就要以伟大领袖毛主席为榜样，为全国和全进界人民着想，革命要多少油，我们就生产多少油，支援社会主义建设，支援世界革命人民的斗争。全国著名劳动模范、沈阳变压器厂工人出身的工程师王凤恩兴奋地说，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产，把工厂当成反帝、反修的战场，决心为中国革命和世界革命贡献自己最大的力量。战斗在冰雪封冻、拔海五千多米的唐古拉山顶的藏族道班工人纷纷表示：我们坚决响应毛主席抓革命促生产的号召，下定决心战严寒，斗冰雪，一定要把公路养护好。
    喜讯飞越千山万水传到我国广大的农村，正在田野上秋收冬种、大修水利、大搞农田基本建设的男女社员纷纷举行座谈会，高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》，高呼“毛主席万岁！”许多社员在田头地边拿出红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》朗读起来，表达他们对毛主席的无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰。山西省大寨大队的社员们说，毛主席的话一字千金，句句是宝，一句顶一万句。过去我们听毛主席的话，打败了帝国主义，消灭了封建剥削，走上了社会主义的幸福大道；今后我们要永远听毛主席的话，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把大寨办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    各地广大革命干部听到毛主席检阅革命小将的喜讯，受到极大鼓舞。他们重温了毛主席的亲切教导：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”表示决心要永远突出无产阶级政治，到群众中去，和群众同呼吸，共命运。他们说：世界上只有毛主席这样伟大的领袖，伟大的无产阶级革命家，才能这样信任群众，关怀群众，支持群众。毛主席是我们最光辉的榜样，我们一定要向伟大领袖毛主席学习学习再学习。
    据新华社二十七日讯　“在中国革命和国际共产主义运动历史上，有谁在这样短时间内接见过千万革命群众？只有我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席！谁是世界上最最伟大的无产阶级革命家？是我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席！”人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，怀着无限幸福、无限兴奋和无限激动的心情，热烈欢呼毛主席第八次接见文化革命大军，欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，一致表示：永远紧紧跟随最高统帅毛主席，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的正确路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好，夺取新的更大胜利。
    海军、空军和北京、南京、沈阳、昆明、济南、成都等许多部队指战员，今天清晨听完广播，立即纷纷举行座谈。指战员们激动地说，我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席连续八次接见了一千一百多万来自全国各地和首都的革命师生和红卫兵，这是中国革命和国际共产主义运动历史上前所未有的伟大革命创举。这最最有力地说明，毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命行动，时时刻刻和群众心连着心。毛主席以他的伟大革命实践，为我们树立了最光辉的榜样，同时也为全世界的马克思列宁主义者树立了最光辉的榜样。守卫在黄海前哨某岛的沈阳部队某连指战员，听到喜讯，人人手捧红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，列队朗读：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”驻守在祖国西南边疆的边防部队某部指战员，又一次学习了毛主席语录：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”指战员们说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，对待群众采取什么态度和立场，是区分以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的分水岭。毛主席冒着严寒，连续两天第八次接见革命群众，亲自指引文化革命大军胜利进军，这最充分说明毛主席是我们心中最最热爱、最最敬仰、最最崇拜的伟大领袖，是全世界最伟大的无产阶级革命家。我们闹革命就要牢记毛主席的伟大教导，永远相信群众，依靠群众，一时一刻也不脱离群众，全心全意为人民群众服务。参加海军南海舰队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表，一致认为，毛主席对广大革命群众的最大支持最大关怀最大鼓舞，是无产阶级文化大革命胜利的根本保证。空军某学校步行远征队，不久前在毛主席接见后，从北京出发进行步行串连。当他们途经开封时，听到毛主席第八次接见革命群众和红卫兵的喜讯，非常兴奋，立即举行了座谈。他们说：我们离开北京后的长征途中，已经三次听到我们伟大领袖毛主席接见红卫兵的喜讯，每一次都把我们又带回见到毛主席的幸福时刻。毛主席的心紧紧和我们贴在一起。一想起毛主席，我们浑身就有了力量，战胜了长征途中一个又一个的困难。我们一定坚决沿着毛主席指引的道路走到底，永远跟着毛主席闹革命。
    “毛主席开辟长征路，革命小将跟上来，长征路上阔步迈，金轨铺到共产主义新世界”。许多部队指战员听到这次接受毛主席检阅的红卫兵小将中，有许多是从全国各地全程步行长征来北京的，十分兴奋，他们满腔热情地赞扬和支持红卫兵全程步行串连，是把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业可靠接班人的好办法。驻守在大凉山上的成都部队学习毛主席著作先进单位某彝民团六连的指战员，最近连续三次热情接待了步行串连的红卫兵长征队。红卫兵的革命精神和革命毅力，使他们受到了深刻的教育。指战员们说，在毛主席的支持和鼓舞下，红卫兵小将们响应林彪同志的号召，进行全程步行串连，到大风大浪中去锻炼，宣传毛泽东思想，把自己锻炼成为革命的好后代、红后代。今天的红卫兵，是未来的工农兵。将来我们把枪杆子交给这样的阶级兄弟，交给用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经历过艰难险阻、在大风大浪中闯出来的阶级兄弟，一百个放心，一千个放心，一万个放心。我们为有这样的革命接班人而高兴。驻守在浙赣公路旁的通信兵某部指战员，特地在公路边设立了一个接待步行长征到井冈山的红卫兵的宣传鼓动站，今天清晨，他们当听到毛主席第八次接见革命小将的喜讯后，立即和来自上海、江苏、浙江等地步行向井冈山进发的四百多名红卫兵长征小将，一起举行了庆祝大会和座谈会。指战员表示坚决支持红卫兵小将步行革命串连，虚心学习红卫兵小将的革命意志和革命精神，永远按着毛主席指示的方向奋勇前进。曾经参加过两万五千里长征的红军老战士、济南部队某部政委李布德说，当年毛主席带领红军长征，向全世界宣告了中国革命一定要胜利。今天，红卫兵长征，又向全世界宣告，我们坚定不移地按照毛主席指引的路走到底，一直走到共产主义。
    广州、兰州、武汉、福州等部队和新疆、内蒙古、西藏军区以及铁道兵、工程兵、通信兵许多部队指战员，在座谈时还一致认为：无产阶级文化大革命越来越好的形势，对我们提出了新的更高的要求；只有坚决遵循毛主席的教导，按照林彪同志的指示，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”作为座右铭，开展灭资兴无、破私立公的思想斗争，树立共产主义世界观，才能跟上迅速发展的革命形势。（附图片）
    五星红旗迎风飘扬，一轮红日升起在东方。毛主席啊，我们心中的红太阳！您是世界上最伟大的无产阶级革命家，只有您这样伟大的马克思列宁主义者，只有您这样伟大的天才，才有这样巨大的魄力和决心，发动这场震撼世界的伟大的革命群众运动。您为全世界的马克思列宁主义者，为我们青年一代，树立了最光辉的榜样。
