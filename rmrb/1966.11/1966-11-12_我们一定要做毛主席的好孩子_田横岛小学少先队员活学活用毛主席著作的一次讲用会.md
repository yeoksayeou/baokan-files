The Tianheng Island Primary School in Jimo County, Shandong Province, treats the study of Chairman Mao's works as the main course. They organize students to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, continuously instilling Mao Zedong Thought into the students' minds, effectively raising their class consciousness. Below is a record of a part of the school's Young Pioneers' sharing session on the theme "We love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, we love to listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, we must be Chairman Mao's good children."

From a Young Age, Learning to Serve the People

Song Shufang, a second-year student and the Young Pioneers squad leader (9 years old), said:

In the past, I would go home and play after finishing my homework every day. After the teacher told us the story of Comrade Zhang Zedong serving the people, I thought, although I am young, I am already a Young Pioneer. I must listen to Chairman Mao's words and learn from Comrade Zhang Zedong. From then on, I no longer played after school.

Once, I saw that the child of a community member, Song Jiaxiu, had no one to take care of, so I took the initiative to look after him. At first, I didn't know how to take care of a child; when the child cried, I couldn't comfort him. Sometimes the child would soil himself, making it very dirty, and I didn't want to do it anymore. I thought, I can't comfort the child, so I should find something else to do that is also serving the people. The next day at school, the teacher let us study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again. After studying, I thought: Comrade Zhang Zedong was not afraid of hardship or dirt; he dedicated himself to the revolution by making charcoal. I should also learn from Comrade Zhang Zedong to serve the people wholeheartedly. Taking care of a child is difficult, making charcoal is also difficult, but Comrade Zhang Zedong could overcome it, so why can't I? I can too. From then on, I took care of Song Jiaxiu's child every day. Sometimes when the child soiled himself, I would clean him without hesitation. Sometimes when the child cried, I would hold him, pick wildflowers, and play with him. Uncle Song Jiaxiu happily said: Shufang has become very sensible after starting school. I said: I want to learn from Comrade Zhang Zedong and serve the people. He smiled and said: Good, I also want to learn from Zhang Zedong and work hard for the team.

Care for the Collective

Wang Xiuxiang, a sixth-year class monitor and the Young Pioneers squad leader (14 years old), said:

In the past, no matter what I did, I always thought of my small group first. In school, I only wanted to make our class newspaper good, and in the class, I only cared about our group's affairs. I didn't care about the collective's affairs at all. If there was a problem in the school, I would first see if it was our class's problem. If it was, I would solve it; if it wasn't, I wouldn't care. In the class, it was the same. If there was a problem, I would first see if it was our group's problem. If it was, I would solve it; if it wasn't, I still wouldn't care.

Once during a physical education class, two classmates started fighting. I thought, the teacher isn't here, should I intervene? I looked again, and it wasn't our group's classmates, so I quietly walked away. Another time, a female classmate was sweeping their class's courtyard with a broom, so I asked her for the broom to sweep our class's courtyard. She didn't give it to me, and I was unhappy, so I argued with her.

The teacher criticized me for lacking collective spirit, and I felt very wronged, thinking, I wasn't doing it for myself.

After studying Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao's words enlightened me and helped me raise my awareness.

Chairman Mao asked us to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's internationalist and communist spirit, to be selfless and dedicated, and to strive to be an international revolutionary, serving all the people of China and the world in the future. But I only thought of my class and my small group, thinking that the class and the group had my share, and if they did well, I would be glorious, and if they did poorly, I would be responsible. Other classes' affairs were none of my business, which is not in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. When I realized that this was the work of individualism, I decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and overcome this narrow-minded individualist thinking.

The other day, the school asked each class to weave grass mats to cover the windows. In the past, our class would finish and not care about others. But to let the younger students also sit comfortably in the classroom and not be affected by the wind and rain, I discussed with a few classmates and used our rest time to help all the classes in the school weave grass mats. Another time, two younger students in the second year fought, and I separated them and then told them the importance of class brotherhood uniting. I asked them if they wanted to be Chairman Mao's good children, and they said in unison: "Yes, I want to be Chairman Mao's good children."

Be a Selfless Revolutionary

Song Qunxiu, a third-year student and Young Pioneer (12 years old), said:

In the past, I had individualist thoughts and always thought of myself first when encountering things. Once during a collective labor activity at school, everyone sent the grass they picked to the school, but I took it home. I thought, taking it home could be used to cook a meal, so why give it to the school for free?

The teacher found out and helped me study Chairman Mao's quotations. Chairman Mao said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "We all should learn from his spirit of selflessness. From this point, we can become greatly beneficial to the people." But I lacked this spirit of selflessness. When faced with a matter, I was not selfless but only thought of myself, so how could I be Chairman Mao's good child?

I compared myself with Chairman Mao's teachings and thought about the harm of my shortcomings, and I was shocked. I decided to listen to Chairman Mao's words, overcome individualism and self-interest, and be Chairman Mao's good child.

From then on, no matter what happened, I would ask myself: Who does this benefit? Should I do it? If it is not beneficial to the collective, I would not do it no matter how much benefit it brought to me; if it is beneficial to the collective, I would do it no matter how much sacrifice it brought to me. Usually, I would help the team cut grass, push the mill, and carry water for the five-guarantee households. As long as it was beneficial to the collective and others, I would do it wholeheartedly. Although sometimes I was very tired, I thought of overcoming individualism and learning to revolutionize, and I had the strength to continue.

Revolution Requires Selflessness

Yang Bingxia, a fourth-year student and Young Pioneers squad leader (12 years old), said:

Once after school, I was the only one cleaning the courtyard. The next day during the weekly meeting, the teacher praised me. I was very happy. Another time, after school, I was the only one digging a drainage ditch on the playground. The next day, the teacher did not praise me, and I was unhappy, thinking: The teacher did not praise me, and the classmates did not know, so the work I did yesterday was in vain. I will not do it again.

The teacher seemed to see through my thoughts and organized us to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" the next day. The teacher said: To completely and thoroughly serve the people, we must completely and thoroughly remove selfishness. If we revolutionize with the "I" character, the more achievements we have, the more selfish we become. Only by revolutionizing with the "public" character can we make progress and improve. The teacher's every word struck my heart. I was very ashamed. I thought: I only did good deeds to seek praise, and if there was no praise, I would not be willing to do it. How could this be called serving the people?

From then on, I brought my thoughts to study Chairman Mao's works frequently, striving to overcome my shortcomings, and decided to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. The blackboard in the class was broken, so I found cement to repair it. After going home, I also helped the five-guarantee households carry water, push the mill, and sweep the courtyard. As long as it was beneficial to the revolution, I would actively do it. Although no one knew about the good deeds I did, I was still happy. I thought, we revolutionize not for ourselves. Uncle Lei Feng and Uncle Liu Yingjun are not silent heroes who do good deeds without seeking fame. They are my good examples to learn from.

I Learned to Mend Clothes

Song Su'e, a third-year student and Young Pioneer (11 years old), said:

In the past, I did not like to wear old clothes. Usually, when Mom gave me new clothes, I was happy, but when she asked me to wear old clothes, I would pout. Mom told me: Before liberation, our ancestors were oppressed by landlords, and for generations, they had never worn decent clothes. Now that we have been liberated, we must not be immersed in sweetness and forget its taste. In the past, I did not like to hear these words and thought Mom was nagging.

After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on hard work and simplicity, I finally understood that although we have uprooted poverty, our country still needs to be built, and there are still many people in the world who cannot eat or dress warmly. We need to support them. If we do not strive hard, how can we succeed?

It's not that wearing new clothes is bad, but my mind was contaminated with the bourgeoisie's love for dressing up. From now on, I will no longer ask Mom for new clothes. When clothes are torn, I mend them myself. Once, I sewed several times but still couldn't do it well. Accidentally, the needle pricked my finger, but I gritted my teeth and did not give up, finally learning to do needlework.

In the past, when my schoolbag was torn, I wanted to buy a new one, and when my shoes were torn, I wanted to wear new ones. Now I no longer think that way. I mend my schoolbag and shoes myself. As long as you are right, I will do as you say

Wang Shufeng, a fourth-year student and Young Pioneers squad committee member (11 years old), said:

I have a flaw of not liking to be criticized. Once I heard someone criticizing me, it felt like I was shorter than others. Once I fought with a classmate, and the teacher scolded me a few times. I didn't say anything, but I thought: One bowl doesn't make a sound, two bowls make a clatter. I fought with others, so why didn't you criticize him?

Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works, I had the correct understanding of criticism and overcame this flaw.

Chairman Mao said: "The house should be cleaned regularly, otherwise, it will accumulate dust; the face should be washed regularly, otherwise, it will be full of dust. Our comrades' thoughts, our party's work, will also accumulate dust and should be cleaned and washed." After studying this passage, I thought, classmates found my flaws and criticized me to help me progress, which is a good thing, and I should welcome criticism.

From then on, whenever someone criticized me, I would use Chairman Mao's words: "Because we serve the people, so if we have flaws, we are not afraid of others pointing them out. No matter who it is, as long as you point out our flaws, we will correct them. As long as you are right, we will correct ourselves." I strictly required myself. Usually, if someone criticized me correctly, I would accept it; if the criticism was not quite right, I would not argue with others but be alert to myself and not make the same mistake.

### 我们一定要做毛主席的好孩子——田横岛小学少先队员活学活用毛主席著作的一次讲用会

    我们一定要做毛主席的好孩子
    ——田横岛小学少先队员活学活用毛主席著作的一次讲用会
    山东省即墨县田横岛小学把学习毛主席著作当作主课，认真组织学生活学活用毛主席著作，不断地把毛泽东思想灌输到学生的头脑中去，有效地提高了学生的阶级觉悟。下面记述的就是这个小学的一部分少先队员，在一次“我们最最爱读毛主席的书，我们最最爱听毛主席的话，我们一定要做毛主席的好孩子”的讲用会上的发言。
    从小就学着为人民服务
    二年级学生、少先队中队长　宋淑芳（九岁）说：
    过去，我每天放学回家，做完功课就玩。自从老师给我们讲了张思德叔叔为人民服务的故事以后，我就想，我年纪虽小，但我已经是一个少先队员了，我要听毛主席的话，向张思德叔叔学习，从小就学会为人民服务。从此，放学回家后，我再也不贪玩了。
    有一次，我看见社员宋甲秀的孩子没人看，就主动给他看孩子。开始，我不会看小孩，小孩哭了，我也哄不好；有时小孩拉屎，弄得很脏，我有点不想干了，心想：我不会哄小孩，找个会干的事，不也是为人民服务吗？第二天去上学，老师正好又让我们学习《为人民服务》，学习以后，我就想：张思德叔叔不怕苦、不怕脏，一心为革命烧炭，我也应该像张思德叔叔那样全心全意为人民服务。看孩子有困难，烧炭也有困难，张思德叔叔能克服，我就不能克服吗？我也能。从此，我天天给宋甲秀家看小孩，有时小孩拉了屎，我不怕脏就给她擦，有时小孩把屎弄到手上了，我就给她洗，有时小孩哭了，我就抱着她，摘野花逗她玩。宋甲秀大叔高兴地说：小芳上了学真懂事。我说：我要向张思德叔叔学习，为人民服务。他听了笑着说：好，我也向张思德学习，好好为队里干活。
    要关心大集体
    六年级班长、少先队大队长　王秀香（十四岁）说：
    我以前不论做什么事，总是先想到自己的小集体。在学校里我只想把我们的班报搞好，在班里就只想着我们小组的事。对大集体的事一点也不关心。学校里出了什么问题，就先看看是不是我们班级的，是我们班级的，就去解决，不是，我就不闻不问。在班里也是这样，出了什么事，先看看是不是我们小组的，要是，就去解决，不是还是不闻不问。
    有一次上体育课，两个同学打起架来了，我想，老师不在，这个事该不该管呢？我又一看，不是我们小组的同学，就不声不响地走开了。还有一次，一个女同学拿着一把扫帚在扫他们班的院子，我就向她要扫帚，想扫我们班里的院子，她不给我，我就不乐意了，跟她闹了意见。
    老师批评我没有集体主义精神，我感到很委屈，心想，我又不是为了我自己。
    自从学习了毛主席的《纪念白求恩》以后，毛主席的话拨亮了我的心，帮助我提高了认识。
    毛主席要我们学习白求恩同志的国际主义精神和共产主义精神，毫不利己专门利人，立志做一个国际革命派，将来长大了好为全中国人民和全世界人民服务。可我只想到自己的班级，只想到自己的小组，认为班级和小组都有我一份，搞好了我也光荣，搞不好我有责任，其他班的事反正与我无关，这是不符合毛主席的教导的。当我知道了这是个人主义作怪以后，我决心按照毛主席的教导，克服那种狭隘的个人主义思想。
    前几天，学校里叫各班打草帘子挡窗户。要在过去，我们班一打完就不管别人了。但是，为了让低年级的同学也都能舒舒服服地坐在教室里上课，不受风吹雨打，我就和几个同学商量，利用休息时间，帮助全校各班都打上了草帘子。还有一次，二年级有两个小同学打架，我把他俩劝开后，又给他们讲阶级兄弟要互相团结的道理。我问他们要不要做毛主席的好孩子，他们异口同声地说：“要，我要做毛主席的好孩子。”
    做一个没有私心的革命人
    三年级学生、少先队员　宋群修（十二岁）说：
    过去，我有个人主义思想，遇到事情，老为自己打算。有一次学校里集体劳动，别人都把拾到的草送到学校里，我自个儿却背到家里去了。我想，背回家能烧一顿饭，为什么要白白地送给学校呢？
    老师知道后，就帮助我学习毛主席语录。毛主席在《纪念白求恩》中说：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。”可是，我缺乏白求恩这种毫无自私自利之心的精神。一事当先，不是大公无私，而是光为自己打算，这怎么能做毛主席的好孩子呢？
    我对照毛主席的教导，想想自己的缺点的危害性，真是吓了一跳。我决心要好好听毛主席的话，克服个人主义、自私自利的思想，做一个毛主席的好孩子。
    从此以后，不管遇到什么事，我总要问一问自己：这件事对谁有利？该不该做？只要对集体不利，对自己好处多大也不干；只要对集体有利，自己吃多大的亏也要去做。平时，我有空就帮助队里割草，帮别人推碾，帮五保户抬水，只要对集体，对别人有好处的事，就努力去做，尽管有时干得很累了，可是一想到我是在克服个人主义，学习干革命，就有了力气，再累也不怕了。干革命就必须忘我
    四年级学生、少先队小队长　杨炳夏（十二岁）说：
    有一回放学后我一个人在学校里打扫院子，第二天上周会课的时候，老师表扬了我。我听了，心里可乐啦！又有一次，放学后我一个人在操场上挖排水沟，第二天老师没有表扬我，就很不高兴，心想：老师没有表扬，同学们又不知道，昨天的活算是白干了，以后我再也不干了。
    老师好像看透了我的心事似的，第二天就组织我们学习《为人民服务》。老师说：要做到完全、彻底地为人民服务，就必须完全、彻底地挖掉私心。如果带着“我”字干革命，工作成绩越大，私心就越重，只有带着“公”字干革命，才能越干越进步，越干越提高。老师的每句话都说在我心上了。我惭愧极了。心想：我光为了图表扬做好事，不表扬就不愿意做了，这怎么称得上是为人民服务呢？
    从此以后，我带着自己的思想问题，经常学习毛主席著作，努力克服缺点，决心按着毛主席的教导去做。班里的黑板坏了，我就找水泥把黑板补好，回家后还帮助五保户担水、推碾、扫院子，只要对革命有利的事，我就积极干。尽管自己干了好事别人不知道，心里也高兴。我想，我们干革命不是为了自己，雷锋叔叔和刘英俊叔叔，不都是做了好事不作声的无名英雄吗？他们都是我学习的好榜样。
    我学会补衣裳了
    三年级学生、少先队员　宋素娥（十一岁）说：
    以前，我不爱穿旧衣裳。平时，妈妈给我穿新衣裳我就高兴，叫我穿旧衣裳我就撅嘴。妈妈跟我说：解放前咱家祖祖辈辈受地主的压迫，几代人都没有穿过一件像样的衣裳，现在翻身了，可不能泡在蜜糖罐里不知道甜。过去，我就是不爱听这些话，嫌妈妈唠唠叨叨没个完。
    自从学习了毛主席关于艰苦朴素的教导以后，才使我懂得了我们虽然把穷根刨掉了，但是我们的国家还要继续建设，世界上还有许多人吃不饱、穿不暖，还要支援他们，如果不艰苦奋斗，怎么能行呢？
    不是穿新衣裳不好，而是我脑子里沾上了爱打扮的资产阶级思想，以后我再也不向妈妈要新衣裳穿了。衣裳破了，我还自己动手补衣裳呢。有一次，我一连缝了好几次也没有缝好，一不小心，针把手指扎破了，可是我咬咬牙，始终没有灰心，终于学会了做针线活。
    过去书包破了我就想买个新的，鞋子破了也想穿双新的，现在再也不想了，我自己动手把书包和鞋子都补好了。只要你说的对，我就照你的办
    四年级学生、少先队大队委员　王淑风（十一岁）说：
    我有一个不爱听批评的缺点，一听别人批评，就好像自己比别人矮了半截。有一次我跟同学打架，老师说了我几句，我嘴上没说心里想：一个碗不响，两个碗叮当。我跟别人打架，你为什么不批评他？
    后来，学习了毛主席著作，我对批评有了正确的认识，才克服了这个缺点。
    毛主席说：“房子是应该经常打扫的，不打扫就会积满了灰尘；脸是应该经常洗的，不洗也就会灰尘满面。我们同志的思想，我们党的工作，也会沾染灰尘的，也应该打扫和洗涤。”我学了这段语录以后就想，同学们发现我有缺点批评我，是为了帮助我进步，这是好事，我应该欢迎别人的批评才对。
    以后每当有人批评我的时候，我就用毛主席的话“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”严格要求自己。平时，别人批评对了，我接受；批评的不大对，我也不跟别人顶，警惕自己，不要犯这个毛病。
                                （新华社济南电）
