It was already one o'clock in the night. The out-of-town revolutionary students and teachers staying at the reception center of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry had long since fallen asleep. However, the room where the family volunteer sewing and laundry group was working was still brightly lit. Under the lamplight, they were carefully sewing and mending the cotton clothes of some revolutionary youngsters, stitch by stitch. They were afraid that if they mended the clothes during the day, it would interfere with the youngsters' revolutionary activities. So, they preferred to work late into the night, mending the clothes while the students were asleep.

When the youngsters received their mended cotton clothes, they wore them on their bodies and felt warmth in their hearts. They said: The stitches on the clothes are not just threads, but deep class feelings, the boundless warmth of the revolutionary family.

This volunteer sewing and laundry group was organized by more than thirty family members of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, including fifteen elderly women over sixty years old. In mid-September, when they heard that they would be receiving guests invited by Chairman Mao, they could no longer stay at home. They usually studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" together. At this time, they discussed together: Comrade Bethune was a foreigner, over fifty years old, and still traveled thousands of miles to China to help our revolution. Now our country is carrying out such a magnificent Cultural Revolution, and students are conducting revolutionary tours. Can we not do something for them? So, they voluntarily brought their sewing kits and scraps of cloth to serve the youngsters. Later, they gathered a few sewing machines and established the volunteer sewing and laundry group.

Kui Fengzhen, an elderly woman, is already seventy-one years old. She is dedicated and full of energy. She took her two old clothes and unraveled them to mend the students' clothes. Some comrades said, "You are so old, go home and rest." She replied, "Taking care of the guests invited by Chairman Mao, what is a little hard work!" She went to the place where the youngsters stayed and saw who had a hole in their clothes, she would pull them aside and mend it. She also talked about her studies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and her experiences of oppression and exploitation in the old society, educating the youngsters not to forget the past hardships and to follow Chairman Mao to make revolution forever.

Jia Keqing, another elderly woman, is also in her sixties. Once, a student's pants were torn, and he asked Jia to help him take the pocket from his jacket and sew it onto his pants. She took it and was about to mend it, but suddenly thought that students often keep "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their jacket pockets. If she removed it, it might affect him from carrying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with him. She went home and found a matching piece of cloth to mend it, and reminded him, "Chairman Mao's book is our lifeline, our food and weapon. We must carry it with us and study it whenever we have time."

The students were deeply moved by the selfless and altruistic spirit of the volunteer sewing and laundry group. They said: No matter how good it is, it is all because Chairman Mao's education is good. We must take the good experiences and good styles of Beijing back home, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    穿在身上  暖在心上
    ——石油工业部家属义务缝洗组记事
    已经是深夜一点了，住在石油工业部接待站的外地来京革命师生都早已入睡。但是家属义务缝洗组工作的房间，还是灯光通明。她们正在灯光下一针一线地细心为一些革命小将缝补棉衣。因为怕在白天给小将们补棉衣，会妨碍他们进行革命串连，她们宁肯自己晚上受点累，趁同学们睡觉的时候，连夜给缝补。
    小将们拿到缝好的棉衣，穿在身上，暖在心上。他们说：上面缝补的不是一针一线，而是深厚的阶级感情，是革命大家庭的无限温暖。
    这个义务缝洗组是石油工业部的三十几名家属自动组织起来的，其中六十岁以上的老大妈就有十五个。九月中旬，当她们听说要接待毛主席请来的客人，在家里再也坐不住了。她们平时常在一起学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》。这时候，她们又在一起讨论：白求恩同志是个外国人，五十多岁了，还不远万里来到中国帮助我们革命，当前我们国家开展了这样轰轰烈烈的文化大革命，学生们进行革命大串连，我们能不为他们做点事出点力吗？于是，她们自动带着针线包和碎布，上门去为小将们服务。后来，又把几台缝纫机集中起来，成立了义务缝洗组。
    裴凤珍老大妈已经七十一岁了，她一心为公，干劲很足。她把自己的两件旧衣服拿来拆了给同学们补衣服。有的同志说：“您老人家这么大年纪了，回去歇歇吧。”她说：“照顾毛主席请来的客人，辛苦一点算什么！”她到小将们住的地方，看到谁的衣服上有窟窿，拉住就给补。她还一边补衣服，一边给大家讲她学习《毛主席语录》的体会，讲自己在旧社会受的压迫剥削，教育小将们决不能忘记过去的苦，一定要跟着毛主席永远闹革命。
    贾克清老大妈也六十多岁了。有一次，一个同学的裤子破了，请贾大妈帮他拆下上衣口袋补到裤子上。她接过来正准备拆补，突然想到学生的上衣口袋往往是放《毛主席语录》的，如果拆掉了，可能影响他随身携带《毛主席语录》。她便回家找了一块合色的布给补好，并且叮嘱说：
  “毛主席的书是咱们的命根子，是咱们的粮食和武器，咱们一定要随身带着，有空就学。”
    同学们对义务缝洗组毫不利己专门利人的高尚品质非常感动。他们说：千好万好，都是毛主席教育的好。我们一定要把北京的好经验好作风带回去，高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
