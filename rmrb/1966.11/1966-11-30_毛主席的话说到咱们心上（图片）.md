Author: Nán Wèi

Edition: 6

Chairman Mao's words have deeply resonated with us. We are filled with boundless enthusiasm and boundless strength. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to carry out the Cultural Revolution to the end, to criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeois academic "authorities" and the reactionary bourgeois "authorities" in the realm of art and literature. We will thoroughly expose and criticize the reactionary bourgeois ideology and the revisionist ideology, and resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line in all fields. We will strive to create a new proletarian culture and a new proletarian art that is truly for the people and truly revolutionary. We will not allow the old world to be restored, and we will not allow the capitalist roaders to reverse the wheel of history. We will firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely along the path of socialism and communism.
