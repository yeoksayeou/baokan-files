The Liberation Army of South Vietnam strikes American aggressors with precision and success. In one swift action, they destroyed three ammunition depots at the U.S. military's Long Binh base, sending flames soaring over 300 meters into the sky. They also bombarded the puppet "National Day" parade in Saigon, killing and wounding about 50 U.S. and puppet soldiers.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 9th, the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam's Binh Duong Province launched a fierce attack on the U.S. aggressors' Long Binh logistics base, located 20 kilometers northeast of Saigon, on the night of October 28. They successfully destroyed three ammunition depots containing 125,000 bombs, shells, and rockets, as well as several military vehicles, annihilating over 50 U.S. aggressors.

The Long Binh logistics base is one of the largest ammunition depots of the U.S. aggressors in South Vietnam.

As soon as the battle began, the shells from the Liberation Armed Forces struck the heart of the U.S. military logistics base, hitting the three large ammunition depots with thunderous explosions that shook Saigon and the surrounding areas of Binh Duong. The resulting fire reached over 300 meters high. The massive explosion continued until the next morning, causing panic among the enemy in Saigon and Binh Duong.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 10th, the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam fired artillery at Saigon on November 1, killing and wounding approximately 50 U.S. and puppet soldiers, including a U.S. Navy colonel.

On that morning, U.S. aggressors and the puppet regime's leaders gathered at the reviewing stand in front of the "Independence Palace" to prepare for the so-called "National Day" parade.

Just before 6 a.m., as the "parade" was about to begin, the first volley of shells from the Liberation Armed Forces suddenly struck the gathering point behind the reviewing stand.

Many American aggressors and their lackeys were killed and injured, causing chaos and wailing.

Despite the face-saving attempt by the U.S.-puppet clique, they still forced the U.S.-puppet soldiers to proceed with the "parade."

At 7:50 a.m., as the terrified U.S.-puppet soldiers began the "parade," the second volley of shells from the Liberation Armed Forces hit the reviewing stand and the participating troops. The frightened U.S.-puppet soldiers scattered in all directions, while the puppet regime leaders Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky were so terrified that they fled in panic.

The report stated that the people of Saigon from all walks of life were overjoyed and celebrated the new victory of the Liberation Armed Forces.

    南越解放军炮打美国佬，打得准，打得好
    一举击毁美军龙平基地的三座军火库，烈焰腾空三百多米
    排炮齐轰西贡傀儡“国庆节”阅兵式，打死打伤美伪军五十名
    据新华社河内九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方边和省解放武装力量，十月二十八日夜间，猛烈袭击美国侵略军在西贡市东北二十公里的龙平后勤基地，一举击毁装有十二万五千枚炸弹、炮弹和火箭的三座军火库，击毁军车多辆，歼灭美国侵略军五十多名。
    龙平后勤基地是美国侵略军在南越的最大的军火库之一。
    战斗一开始，解放武装力量的炮弹就猛烈地准确地击中美军后勤基地中心的三座大弹药库，爆炸声惊天动地，震撼着西贡和边和一带。爆炸引起的火焰高达三百多米。这次大爆炸一直延续到第二天上午，使西贡和边和一带的敌人惊恐万状。
    据新华社河内十日电　越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量十一月一日炮击西贡市时，打死打伤美伪军约五十名，其中包括一名美国海军上校。
    当天清晨，西贡的美国侵略军和伪政权的头目们集合在“独立宫”前的观礼台上，准备举行所谓“国庆节”阅兵式。
    五点多钟，正当“阅兵式”即将开始的时候，解放武装力量的第一排炮弹突然射进观礼台后边准备举行“阅兵式”的集中地点。
    美国强盗及其走狗死伤很多，哭叫连天，乱成一团。
    美伪集团为了顾全面子，还是壮着胆子强迫美伪官兵举行“阅兵式”。
    七点五十分，当美伪军胆战心惊地开始举行“阅兵式”的时候，解放武装力量的第二排炮弹又飞到了观礼台前边，击中了“独立宫”和参加“阅兵式”的队伍。被吓破了胆的美伪军纷纷抱头鼠窜，傀儡政权头子阮文绍和阮高其更是吓得魂不附体，慌忙逃命。
    报道说，西贡市各界人民欢欣鼓舞，他们热烈欢呼解放武装力量取得的新胜利。
