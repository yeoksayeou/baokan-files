To serve the people, one must be brave enough to correct mistakes

Fang Haidang, the instructor of Fangyao Brigade, Xiangcheng County, Henan

Chairman Mao says: "Since we are serving the people, we should not fear criticism and pointing out our shortcomings. No matter who it is, as long as you point out our mistakes, we will correct them. If your suggestions are beneficial to the people, we will follow them."

This quote is taken from the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune." The central idea is: We should welcome criticism, humbly accept others' opinions, correct our mistakes and shortcomings, and better serve all the people of China and the world.

What is criticism and self-criticism?

Criticism is when revolutionary comrades help each other to do a better job in the revolution. For example, through studying Chairman Mao's works, we know that for the revolution, everyone must remove the "self" and establish the "public." If you only think of yourself and not the collective, and during work, you only think of earning more work points without considering the quality of the farm work, I will point out this shortcoming to you. If you see that I am not following Chairman Mao's instructions in some aspects, you will point out the mistake to me. This is criticism. By comparing oneself with Chairman Mao's instructions, listening to comrades' criticism, recognizing one's own shortcomings and mistakes, bravely admitting and examining them, and deciding to correct them according to Chairman Mao's instructions, this is called self-criticism.

Why should we carry out criticism and self-criticism?

For us commune members, most of us were born in the old society, and our minds are more or less filled with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas. In some people, these ideas are very serious. Even for young people born in the new society, because there are still classes and class struggles, they are easily influenced by old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and have picked up some bad things. Only by thoroughly eliminating bourgeois ideas and establishing proletarian ideas can we have clear minds, firm stands, adhere to the socialist direction, and carry the revolution through to the end. On the other hand, the socialist revolution and socialist construction we are undertaking are both glorious and arduous and complex great causes. On the road ahead, if any of us deviate slightly from Chairman Mao's thoughts, we will go astray. Therefore, we must constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism, always examine ourselves to see if there are any thoughts and actions that do not conform to Chairman Mao's instructions, and correct them as soon as we find them. Only in this way can we closely follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution.

Everyone knows that we farm for the revolution and for the people. If we do not follow Chairman Mao's instructions, produce shortcomings and mistakes, and do not correct them through criticism in time, small shortcomings will develop into big mistakes, which will cause the revolutionary work to suffer losses. For example, some commune members keep the good fertilizer for their private plots and give the bad fertilizer to the brigade. This is "putting oneself first in everything." If everyone does not put good fertilizer on the collective farmland, we cannot produce more grain and do a good job in socialist construction. There are also people who, when the brigade requires high standards and quality in production, do things carelessly, only seeking quantity and not quality. These are manifestations of not being responsible for revolutionary work. If such shortcomings and mistakes are not criticized and corrected, and allowed to develop, they will be very detrimental to the country's construction and the consolidation and development of the collective economy. Therefore, for the benefit of the people and for the cause of the socialist revolution, if we have shortcomings and mistakes, we must criticize and self-criticize in time and correct them thoroughly. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "A house should be cleaned regularly; if not, it will be full of dust. A face should be washed regularly; if not, it will be full of dust." We should clean our faces and sweep our houses regularly, constantly and seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism, and continually overcome our shortcomings and mistakes to better serve the people.

Now let's talk about how to carry out criticism and self-criticism.

According to my understanding, first, we must clarify the purpose of carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The purpose of exposing errors and criticizing shortcomings is like a doctor treating a disease, completely for the purpose of saving people, not for killing people." This means that we carry out criticism and self-criticism to "treat diseases and save people," not to criticize and condemn people. Second, in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, we must adhere to principles. Chairman Mao says: "Some comrades' criticisms do not pay attention to major issues, only to minor issues. They do not understand that the main task of criticism is to point out political errors and organizational errors." Chairman Mao's words tell us that when we criticize, we should pay special attention to major issues, issues of principle, and issues of direction and path. Third, we must adopt an attitude of being responsible to the revolution and to comrades, starting from caring for, loving, and helping comrades, being honest and straightforward, neither exaggerating nor belittling, and carrying out criticism in a realistic manner. Fourth, the manner of criticism should be gentle and persuasive. When criticizing others, be patient and sincere, do not be simple and rude, and do not mock or ridicule. Only in this way can criticism achieve better results. Fifth, when criticizing comrades, we should do our best to "speak without reservation and speak without restraint," saying whatever needs to be said; those being criticized should "correct if there is a fault, and strive if there is none," correcting decisively if the criticism is correct; if not, learning from it to prevent similar mistakes in the future, and not calculating the manner and attitude of the criticism.

Most comrades in our brigade have a correct understanding of carrying out criticism and self-criticism and use it well in work and production. However, there are also some people who, due to insufficient study of Chairman Mao's instructions, still hold various incorrect attitudes towards criticism and self-criticism. Some are "unconcerned and indifferent," knowing something is wrong but not saying or raising it; some criticize others not for "treating diseases and saving people" but for helping comrades progress; some individual comrades get angry and have a bad attitude when criticizing others; and some can only criticize others but cannot accept criticism from others. These are all wrong and harmful to the country, the collective, and individuals. Comrades with these shortcomings should, through this lesson, consciously examine themselves and correct their mistakes.

For myself, I also had insufficient understanding and did not do enough in carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the past. I thought that criticizing others would hurt feelings, offend people, and cause disharmony. Therefore, I did not care about or question things that were not beneficial to the country and the collective. Once, I saw someone secretly taking the brigade's coal, and I wanted to criticize him, but then I thought, the brigade's coal is not mine, if I criticize him, he will definitely be angry with me. Thinking this, I turned my face away and pretended not to see. Through study, I realized that this way of thinking and doing is completely wrong, and I will correct it in the future. In accepting others' criticism, I also did not do enough, sometimes thinking that others criticizing me was deliberately making me look bad and picking on me, so I could not humbly accept others' opinions; sometimes I was also dissatisfied with those who gave suggestions. In the future, I will humbly accept others' criticism, constantly examine and correct my shortcomings, and completely and thoroughly serve the people.

In summary, through this lesson, we should understand the great significance of criticism and self-criticism. When we do things and handle problems, we should try our best to avoid making mistakes, especially big mistakes. However, sometimes mistakes and shortcomings will inevitably occur. No matter what kind of mistakes and shortcomings, they are not beneficial to the people. Therefore, we should not hide our own and others' mistakes but should bravely and timely examine and correct them. We should do it so that if there is a small shortcoming, we examine and correct it a little. "For the people's interests, we persist in what is right, and for the people's interests, we correct what is wrong." Only in this way can we quickly achieve ideological revolutionization and better serve the people.

### 为人民服务就要勇于改正错误

专栏：学习毛主席语录辅导

    为人民服务就要勇于改正错误
    河南襄城县方窑大队辅导员　方海堂
    毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”
    这条语录是从《为人民服务》这篇文章里摘录出来的。中心意思是：我们应该欢迎别人批评，虚心接受别人的意见，改正自己的错误和缺点，以便更好地为全中国人民和全世界人民服务。
    什么是批评与自我批评呢？
    批评，就是我们革命同志相互之间，为了把革命工作做好，你帮助我，我帮助你，指出缺点，以便改正错误，共同提高。比方说：我们通过学习毛主席著作，知道了为革命种田，每个人都要去掉“私”字，树立“公”字。如果你光为自己打算，不为集体着想，你在做活的时候，只为多挣工分，不顾农活质量，我就给你指出这个缺点；你如果看到我哪一方面没有按毛主席的指示办事，你就给我指出错误来。这就是批评。自己对照毛主席的指示，听了同志们的批评意见，认识到自己的缺点错误，能够大胆地承认和检查自己的缺点错误，并且决心加以改正，按照毛主席的指示去办，这就叫自我批评。
    为啥要开展批评与自我批评呢？
    就我们社员来说，大多数都是生在旧社会，脑子里或多或少地存在着一些资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想。在有些人身上，这种思想表现得还很严重。就是生长在新社会的青年人，因为现在还有阶级和阶级斗争，他们容易受旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的影响，也沾染了一些坏东西。只有把资产阶级思想彻底挖掉，树立起无产阶级的思想，才能心明眼亮，立场坚定，坚持社会主义方向，将革命进行到底。另一方面，我们所进行的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，是最光荣伟大，又艰巨复杂的大事。在前进的道路上，我们每个人稍微离开毛主席的思想，就会走到岔路上去。所以，我们必须经常开展批评与自我批评，时刻检查自己有那些想法和行动是不符合毛主席的指示的，发现了就很快改正，这样才能紧紧跟着毛主席闹革命。
    大家都知道，咱们种地也是为革命，也是为人民服务。如果我们不照毛主席的指示去做，产生了缺点和错误，不通过批评及时改正，小缺点就会发展成大错误，那就会使革命工作受到损失。比如：有的社员把好粪留着上自留地，把坏粪交给队里，这就是“一事当前，先替自己打算”。如果大家都不把好粪上到集体耕地里，就不能多打粮食，搞好社会主义建设。还有的人，队里要求生产高标准，农活高质量，他却马马虎虎，只求数量，不管质量，这些都是对革命工作不负责任的表现。像这样的缺点错误，如果不批评改正，让它发展下去，对于国家的建设和集体经济的巩固、发展都是十分不利的。所以，为了人民的利益，为了社会主义革命事业，我们如果有了缺点和错误，就要及时地进行批评和自我批评，彻底加以改正。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“房子是应该经常打扫的，不打扫就会积满了灰尘；脸是应该经常洗的，不洗也就会灰尘满面。”我们要像洗脸扫地一样，经常认真地开展批评与自我批评，不断地克服我们的缺点和错误，更好地为人民服务。
    再说说怎样开展批评与自我批评。
    根据我的领会，第一，要明确开展批评与自我批评的目的。毛主席教导我们说：“揭发错误、批判缺点的目的，好像医生治病一样，完全是为了救人，而不是为了把人整死。”这就是说，我们开展批评和自我批评是为了“治病救人”，不是为了整人，给谁难看。第二，开展批评与自我批评，要坚持原则。毛主席说：“有些同志的批评不注意大的方面，只注意小的方面。他们不明白批评的主要任务，是指出政治上的错误和组织上的错误。”毛主席的这段话是叫我们在进行批评的时候，应当特别注意抓大的问题，原则性的问题，方向道路的问题等。第三，要采取对革命、对同志负责的态度，从关心、爱护、帮助同志出发，要一是一，二是二，既不夸大，也不缩小，实事求是地开展批评。第四，批评的方式要和风细雨，以理服人。批评别人要耐心诚恳，不要简单粗暴，更不要讽刺挖苦，只有这样，批评才能收到更好的效果。第五，批评同志的时候，应当做到“知无不言，言无不尽”，有啥说啥；被批评的同志，要做到“有则改之，无则加勉”，批评得正确，就坚决改正；不正确，就引以为戒，防止今后犯这样的错误，而不要计较批评的方式和态度。
    咱们队大多数同志对开展批评与自我批评有了正确的认识，在工作中和生产上运用得也较好。但是，也有一些人，由于对毛主席的指示学习不够，对批评和自我批评还抱着种种不正确的态度。有的是“事不关己，高高挂起”，明知不对也不说、不提；有的对别人提意见不是为了“治病救人”，不是为了帮助同志进步；还有个别同志批评别人的时候发脾气，态度不好；也有的人只能批评别人，不能接受别人的批评。这些都是不对的，对国家、对集体、对个人都是有害无益的。有这些缺点的同志，应当通过这一课的学习，自觉检查，坚决改正。
    拿我自己来说，以前对开展批评和自我批评也是认识不足，做得很不够。认为批评别人会伤感情，得罪人，失和气。所以，对于一些不利于国家和集体利益的事情也不管不问。有一次，我看到有人私自拿队里的煤用，我想批评他，可又一想，队里的煤不是我的，我要批评了他，他非恼我不可。想到这里，我就把脸一扭装作没看见。通过学习，我认识到这种想法、做法是完全错误的，今后我要决心改正。在接受别人的批评方面，我做得也很不够，有时认为别人批评自己是故意给我难看，和我过不去，因此不能虚心接受别人的意见；有时还对提意见的人不满。今后我要虚心接受别人的批评，不断检查和改正自己的缺点，完全彻底地为人民服务。
    总之，通过这一课的学习，我们要认识到批评与自我批评的重大意义。我们在办各种事情、处理各种问题的时候，要尽量避免犯错误，特别是避免犯大的错误。但是，有时总会发生一些缺点和错误。不管是什么样的缺点和错误，对人民都没有好处。所以，对待自己的和别人的错误，都不应该隐藏起来，要能够大胆地、及时地检查和纠正。我们要做到，有一点缺点，就检查一点，就改正一点。“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”。这样，我们才能更快地实现思想革命化，更好地为人民服务。
