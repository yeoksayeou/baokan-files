Our Foreign Ministry's Reply Rebuts the Soviet Side's Slander Against Our Government and Revolutionary Masses

The Soviet leadership has further exposed its traitorous face.

Our revolutionary youth posting big-character posters to protest the Soviet government's unreasonable expulsion of our students is a completely just revolutionary action.

A Xinhua News Agency report from November 1st: Our country's Foreign Ministry's Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Bureau Director Yu Zhan today summoned the Soviet Union's Chargé d'Affaires Razdukhov and handed him a reply from our Foreign Ministry to the Soviet Foreign Ministry's October 27th note. Our Foreign Ministry's reply firmly rejects the Soviet Foreign Ministry's note's absurd complaints and unreasonable demands, and sternly refutes the note's slander against our government and revolutionary masses.

The reply states: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China firmly rejects the absurd complaints and unreasonable demands made by the Soviet Foreign Ministry in its note of October 27, 1966. This note slanders Chinese officials for organizing mass anti-Soviet disturbances near the Soviet Embassy in China, attempting to sharpen the contradictions between the two countries. This is sheer nonsense.

The reply states: In recent times, the Soviet leadership, while colluding with American imperialism and selling out the interests of the world's revolutionary people, has also launched a new wave of anti-China sentiment, further worsening Sino-Soviet relations, and unreasonably expelling all Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union. This cannot but arouse the extreme indignation of the Chinese revolutionary masses. Some revolutionary youth spontaneously went to the "Anti-Revisionism Road" opposite the Soviet Embassy to post big-character posters, protesting your unreasonable expulsion of Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union, condemning your intensification of anti-China sentiment and worsening of Sino-Soviet relations, and shouting slogans such as "To oppose imperialism, we must oppose revisionism," "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union," "Long live Marxism-Leninism," and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." Their actions are completely just and revolutionary. You claim that their revolutionary actions have an open anti-Soviet character. Isn't this a deliberate slander? If you have the courage, please publish all the big-character posters written by the Chinese revolutionary masses in the Soviet newspapers and let the Soviet people comment on them to see which one is against the Soviet people.

For several days, our revolutionary masses have been very restrained and orderly in their actions. They have not harmed the personnel, vehicles, or buildings of the Soviet Embassy in any way. Your Chargé d'Affaires and his wife, as well as the embassy staff, frequently go to the "Anti-Revisionism Road" to read the big-character posters and have not been interfered with in any way. There is no question of disrupting the normal work of the embassy. On the contrary, it is the personnel of the Soviet Embassy who have taken provocative actions against the revolutionary masses, attempting to create incidents. You accuse our revolutionary masses of being "troublemakers," and their revolutionary actions of being "disturbances" and "hooliganism." This only exposes your traitorous face of hostility towards the Chinese people.

You are determined to oppose China and, finding no pretext, make a big issue out of the fact that cars cannot pass through the "Anti-Revisionism Road." Your note of August 26th insists that our revolutionary masses obstructed the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires from going to the airport to see off the Vice President of Zambia, and this note says that the entrance to the Soviet Embassy has been blocked, preventing the vehicles of Soviet Embassy guests from returning to their premises. This is not worth refuting. Sometimes there are many people gathered on the "Anti-Revisionism Road," and vehicles cannot pass temporarily. This is a very common occurrence. Moreover, the Soviet Embassy has several roads for external communication, and vehicles going to and from the Soviet Embassy originally have other roads to take. You create such absurd excuses, falsely accusing us of violating the principles of state relations, international norms, and diplomatic immunity, attempting to deceive those who do not know the truth, and smearing our faces. This is both laughable and pathetic.

The reply concludes: It should be pointed out that, to say nothing of the past, since the new leadership of the CPSU came to power, you have colluded with the United States to oppose China, colluded with India to oppose China, colluded with Japan to oppose China, and organized a encirclement of China. You have broken your word and arbitrarily torn up agreements between China and the Soviet Union, taking a series of steps to continuously worsen relations between the two countries. You have gone further down the road of revisionism and splitism than Khrushchev. What qualifications do you have to talk about the principles of state relations and international norms? We advise you to be honest for a change, otherwise, the more you try to cover up, the more you will expose your anti-China face.

### 苏联领导集团更加暴露了自己的叛徒嘴脸

    我外交部复照痛斥苏方对我国政府和革命群众的诬蔑
    苏联领导集团更加暴露了自己的叛徒嘴脸
    我革命青年贴大字报抗议苏联政府无理赶走我留学生，完全是正义的革命行动
    新华社一日讯　我国外交部苏联东欧司司长余湛今天召见苏联驻华大使馆临时代办拉兹杜霍夫，面交我国外交部对苏联外交部十月二十七日照会的复照。我国外交部复照断然拒绝苏联外交部来照对中国方面提出的荒谬抗议和无理要求，严词驳斥苏联来照对中国政府和革命群众的诬蔑。
    复照说，中华人民共和国外交部断然拒绝一九六六年十月二十七日苏联外交部来照中对中国方面提出的荒谬抗议和无理要求。这个照会诬蔑中国官方人士在苏联驻华大使馆附近组织群众性的反苏骚乱，企图使苏中两国关系尖锐化。这完全是一派胡言。
    复照说，最近以来，苏联领导集团一方面同美帝国主义进行大勾结，对世界人民的革命利益进行大拍卖；另一方面又掀起新的反华浪潮，加紧恶化中苏两国关系，无理赶走全部中国留苏学生。这不能不激起中国广大革命群众的无比愤慨。有些革命青年自发地前往苏联驻华大使馆对面的“反修路”贴大字报，抗议你们无理赶走中国留苏学生，谴责你们加紧反华和恶化中苏两国关系，高呼反帝必须反修、中苏两国人民的友谊万岁、马克思列宁主义万岁、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁等口号，他们这种行动完全是正义的革命的行动。你们硬说什么他们的这种革命行动带有公开反苏的性质，这不明明是蓄意诽谤吗？你们有胆量的话，请你们把中国革命群众写的大字报统统在苏联的报纸上登出来，让苏联人民评论评论，看看究竟有那一条是反对苏联人民的。
    几天以来，我革命群众的行动是非常克制的，很有秩序的。他们对苏联大使馆的人员、车辆和建筑物，秋毫无犯。你们的临时代办夫妇和使馆工作人员时常到“反修路”看大字报，并没有受到任何干扰，根本不存在破坏大使馆的正常工作的问题。相反的，倒是苏联大使馆的人员对革命群众采取挑衅性行动，妄图制造事端。你们来照把我革命群众诬蔑成“捣乱者”，把他们的革命行动诬蔑为“骚乱”和“流氓行为”，这只能暴露你们敌视中国人民的叛徒嘴脸。
    你们处心积虑地要反对中国，找不到题目，就拿汽车不能在“反修路”通行大做文章。你们八月二十六日的照会硬说我革命群众阻挠苏联临时代办前往飞机场欢送赞比亚共和国副总统，这次来照又说苏联使馆的入口被封锁，使苏联使馆客人的车辆不能回到自己的馆舍。这是不值一驳的。“反修路”上有时集聚群众较多，车辆暂时不能通行，这是很平常的事情。而且，苏联大使馆的对外通路有几条，来往苏联大使馆的车辆原有其他道路可走，你们制造这种荒唐的借口，硬给我们扣上破坏国家关系原则、国际法准则和外交豁免权的大帽子，妄图欺骗不明真相的人们，往我们脸上抹黑。这是十分可笑而又可怜的。
    复照最后说，应该指出，远的不说，自从苏共新领导上台以来，你们联美反华，联印反华，联日反华，组织对中国的包围圈。你们背信弃义，恣意撕毁中苏之间的协议，采取一系列步骤不断恶化两国关系。你们在修正主义和分裂主义的道路上走得比赫鲁晓夫还远。你们还有什么资格来奢谈国家关系原则和国际法准则呢？我们奉劝你们还是老实一点好，否则欲盖弥彰，更加暴露自己的反华面目。
