On October 31, the Vietnam Democratic Republic's Commission for Investigating U.S. Imperialist War Crimes in Vietnam issued a statement severely condemning the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialists in Vietnam. It called on people around the world to take action, denouncing U.S. imperialism as the biggest war criminal of the contemporary world. The Chinese people resolutely support the just stance of the Vietnamese people and angrily condemn the war crimes committed by U.S. imperialists against the Vietnamese people.

U.S. imperialism is the most vicious and brutal enemy of all the people of the world. In its war of aggression against Vietnam, it has implemented a "three lights" policy of burning, killing, and destroying everything. It has been relentlessly bombing the cities and residential areas, dikes, and water conservancy projects in North Vietnam day and night. In South Vietnam, it has dumped thousands of tons of ammunition on the land, using various methods to kill people, including poison gas. The brutality of the U.S. aggressors far surpasses that of the Hitler fascists and Japanese militarists of yesteryears. U.S. imperialism is undoubtedly the biggest war criminal of the contemporary world.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. All the reactionaries' schemes to kill people are aimed at suppressing the revolution. They think that the more people they kill, the weaker the revolution will be. However, contrary to their reactionary wishes, the more people they kill, the stronger the revolutionary forces will become, and the closer the reactionaries will be to their doom. This is an irresistible law." U.S. imperialism attempts to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people through large-scale killings, but the result will be the opposite. Those who will ultimately be destroyed are not the Vietnamese people, but the U.S. aggressors on Vietnamese soil.

The Vietnamese people are a brave people who fear no tyranny. The brutal atrocities of U.S. imperialism can only inspire the Vietnamese people to strengthen their resolve, to fight the war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end, until there is not a single U.S. soldier left on Vietnamese soil. Chairman Ho Chi Minh recently issued a call: "The Vietnamese people must unite as one, endure hardships, and be ready to make sacrifices to decisively defeat the U.S. aggressors." This is the battle oath of the 31 million Vietnamese people and the best response to the extremely savage U.S. imperialists.

    美帝国主义是当代最大的战争罪犯
    本报评论员
    十月三十一日，越南民主共和国调查美帝国主义在越南的战争罪行委员会发表一项声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义在越南犯下的滔天罪行，呼吁全世界人民行动起来，声讨美帝国主义这个当代最大的战争罪犯。中国人民坚决支持越南人民的正义立场，愤怒谴责美帝国主义对越南人民犯下的战争罪行。
    美帝国主义是全世界人民的最凶恶、最残暴的敌人。它在侵略越南的战争中，实行烧光、杀光、毁光的“三光”政策，对越南北方的城镇和居民区，堤坝和水利工程，日日夜夜进行狂轰滥炸；在越南南方的土地上，倾泻成千上万吨弹药，使用种种杀人手段，甚至包括毒气，来残杀人民。美国侵略者的残暴，远远超过了当年希特勒法西斯匪徒和日本军国主义者。美帝国主义是不折不扣的当代最大的战争罪犯。
    毛主席指出：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”美帝国主义想用大规模杀人的办法来扑灭越南人民的革命烈火，其结果只能是相反。最后被消灭的，不是越南人民，而是在越南土地上的美国侵略者。
    越南人民是不畏强暴的英勇的人民。美帝国主义的残暴兽行，只能激励越南人民增强斗志，把抗美救国的战争打到底，打到越南土地上没有一个美国兵为止。胡志明主席最近发出号召：“越南人民要团结一致，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，决心战胜美国侵略强盗。”这是三千一百万越南人民的战斗誓言，也是对野蛮透顶的美帝国主义的最好回答。
