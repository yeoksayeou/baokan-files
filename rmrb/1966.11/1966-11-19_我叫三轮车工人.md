On the evening of October 26, two of us students arrived in Beijing from Xuzhou.

It was our first time in Beijing, and we were unfamiliar with the routes. The reception station arranged for us to stay at a unit far from the city center. We asked several comrades along the way, but none of them knew the location of the unit. We were feeling anxious when a rickshaw worker approached us.

He warmly said to us, “Can’t you find your way? No problem, please get on the rickshaw, and I will take you there.” Along the way, this rickshaw worker pedaled while telling us about the new situation in Beijing’s Cultural Revolution.

After a while, we arrived at a construction site. He got off the rickshaw to ask someone inside, then continued to take us forward. After pedaling for a while, the rickshaw stopped at a bus station. He asked a ticket seller and then happily told us, “Young comrades, the place you are looking for is just ahead.”

We traveled a long way before finally reaching our destination. By then, it was very late. We repeatedly asked the rickshaw worker for his name, and he replied, “I work in this area every day. I am a rickshaw worker.” After saying this, he got back on his rickshaw and rode away along the wide road, disappearing in an instant.

This incident happened many days ago, but the image of this rickshaw worker from the capital remains vivid in my mind, and I cannot forget it.

    “我叫三轮车工人”
    十月二十六日晚，我们同学二人从徐州来到了北京。
    我们是初次到北京，路途不熟。接待站把我们安排到一个离市区较远的单位去住。我们在路上询问了几个同志，都说不知道那个单位的所在地。心里正在焦急，一位三轮车工人向我们走了过来。
    他亲切地对我们说：“你们找不到地方吗？好吧，请上车吧，我来送你们去。”一路上，这位三轮车工人一面蹬车，一面给我们讲了不少北京市文化大革命中的新气象。
    过了好一会儿，我们来到一个工地。他下车到里面问了一下，又把我们继续往前送。蹬了一阵，车子在一个汽车站停下了，他向一个售票员打听了一下，回来很高兴地对我们说：“小同志，你们要去的地方马上就到。”
    又走了很远，我们才到了目的地，这时天已经很晚了。我们再三问这位三轮车工人叫什么名字，他回答说：“我每天就在这一带工作，我叫三轮车工人。”说完，就踏着他的车子，顺着宽广的马路驰去，一会儿就不见了。
    这件事情，虽然已经过去了许多天，但是这位首都三轮车工人的形象，却久久地留在我的脑际，怎么也不能忘记。　江苏徐州市一学生
