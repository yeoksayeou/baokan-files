The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory proves: Workers and young technicians armed with Mao Zedong Thought have boundless wisdom. They are the true main force in product design.

	“Look, who is the main force in the field of product design,” among the thousands of revolutionary big-character posters in the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, this one with the striking title is the most eye-catching. The big-character poster uses precise statistics to show: In the eight years before 1958 and the nine years after, the so-called “authorities” and workers, young technicians in the field of design have undergone a reverse transformation. In the former eight years, the vast majority of new products were designed by the so-called “authorities”; in the latter nine years, the situation gradually changed, and in the past two years, the vast majority of new products were designed by workers and young technicians.

	These workers and young technicians, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, dare to practice and dare to innovate. The products they design are of good quality and the design time is short.

	Worker-turned designer Wang Shizheng, who served as the chief designer of a mirror grinding machine tool with world advanced level, exposed the truth about a grinding machine designed by the “authorities.” The “authorities” obtained a sample machine from abroad and bought a whole box of drawing materials. They copied and copied for several years before they “copied” out a “design.” However, because their design was not practical, it could not be tested as is. Later, workers participated and made three major revisions and dozens of minor revisions. The design change order opened more than two thousand sheets, and almost all the designed parts were replaced, before it was finally made.

	Young technician Yao Guanxiong, who participated in the design of a dynamic balancing machine reaching world advanced level, narrated the process of the birth of the dynamic balancing machine: In 1957, a so-called “authority” obtained a foreign dynamic balancing machine and treasured it like a precious gem. This “authority” then “studied” in seclusion for ten months before starting to “design,” actually still copying and pasting. Whatever the foreign machine looked like, he also “designed” it to look like that. Whatever materials the foreign machine used, he also used the same materials. What was even more ridiculous was that there was a small hole on the glass surface of the indicator, but he himself did not know what it was for, yet he insisted that the machining workshop make a small hole. It was not until last year’s product design revolution movement that workers took to the design stage and combined with young technicians, completely overturned this “copied” foreign gadget, and designed a new type of dynamic balancing machine in just four and a half months. Not only was it better than the “authority’s” copied foreign design, but it was also better than the foreign machine. The precision was higher than the foreign product, the parts were fewer than the foreign product, and all domestic materials were used.

	Worker designer Wu Xingzhong from the hydraulic workshop talked about an example of reforming a foreign machine. There was an imported operating box, known as the heart of the machine tool, but it was very inconvenient to use. Workers advocated surgery, but the “authorities” thought it could not be done. Workers, for the needs of production, resolutely broke through the obstruction of the “authorities,” and since 1953, they have operated on this operating box eight times. Now, the parts of this operating box have been greatly simplified, and the weight has been reduced from forty-five kilograms to five or six kilograms. The performance has caught up with and surpassed the world’s advanced level. After the workers’ surgery was successfully completed, the “authorities” who originally insisted that it “could not be done” stole the workers’ innovation achievements, wrote papers, held meetings, and secretly placed themselves on the throne of the world’s hydraulic “authorities.”

	Assembly worker Hu Kewei and young technician Zhu Zugen gave an example of a flat grinding machine designed by the “authorities.” The grinding head on this grinding machine was made for eight years but never completed. The “authorities” organized several attacks, made thirty or so grinding heads, such as “Zhang’s grinding head,” “Wu’s grinding head,” “Zhang’s grinding head,” and so on, but they could not solve the grinding head that was truly needed in production. What was the reason? Originally, these “authorities” were not really attacking the grinding head, but rather, the “I” was at the head, scheming and plotting, fighting for fame and profit. They would not listen to others’ opinions, and even more so, they would not listen to workers’ opinions. They wasted eight years of time and achieved nothing. Last year, during the design revolution movement, the factory leadership organized a “three-in-one” attack team with workers as the main force, and solved the problem in a few months.

	Facts are the most persuasive, and practice is the most authoritative. Workers and young technicians have drawn a conclusion from one fact after another and one practice after another: Bourgeois “authorities” who are detached from reality and the masses believe in the philosophy of “servitude” and follow the “crawling line.” They cannot move an inch without their foreign crutch and cannot live without their foreign textbooks. Their minds are clouded by thoughts of fame and profit, and their wisdom is killed by foreign frameworks. Relying on them, design cannot be innovative, and products cannot be revolutionary. Only when the worker masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought take to the stage of product design can they create their own style, walk their own path, and quickly catch up with and surpass the world’s advanced level.

### 谁是产品设计领域的主力军？

    谁是产品设计领域的主力军？
    上海机床厂的事实证明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人和青年技术人员智慧无穷，他们是真正的产品设计的主力军。
      “看，到底谁是产品设计领域的主力军”，在上海机床厂千百张革命的大字报中间，这一张大字报的醒目标题，最引人注意。大字报用精确的统计表明：一九五八年以前的八年和以后九年，所谓“权威”同工人、青年技术人员在设计领域中的地位，发生了相反的转化。前八年，绝大部分新产品是由所谓“权威”设计的；后九年，情况逐步发生了变化，到最近两年，绝大部分新产品则是由工人和青年技术人员设计的。
    这些工人和青年技术人员，由于有了毛泽东思想作武器，勇于实践，勇于创新，他们设计的产品质量好，设计用的时间也短。
    在设计具有世界先进水平的镜面磨削机床时担任主任设计师的工人出身的设计员王时正，揭露了“权威”们设计的一种磨床的真相。“权威”们为了设计这个产品，先找到了进口的样机，又买来了整箱的图纸资料，抄来抄去，抄了几年，才“抄”出个“设计”来。但是，由于他们的设计不切实际，无法照样试制，后来工人参加作了三次大修改，几十次小修改，设计更改单开了两千多张，设计的零件几乎全部换过，最后才算制成了。
    曾经参加设计达到世界先进水平的一种动平衡机的青年技术员姚关雄，叙述了动平衡机诞生的过程：一九五七年，一个所谓“权威”得到了一台外国的动平衡机，如获至宝。这个“权威”就闭门“研究”了十个月，才开始“设计”，实际上还是照搬照抄，外国什么样子，他也“设计”成什么样子，外国用什么材料，他也用什么材料。尤其可笑的是，指示仪表玻璃面上原来有一个小孔，他自己都不知道有什么用，却要加工车间照样打个小孔。直到去年的产品设计革命运动中，工人登上了设计舞台，同青年技术人员相结合，才彻底推翻了这个“抄”来的洋玩意，只用了四个半月就设计出一种新型的动平衡机。不但比“权威”抄来的洋设计好，比洋机器也好，精度比外国货高，零件比外国货少，而且全部使用国产材料。
    液压车间工人设计员邬兴中，谈了一个改革洋机器的例子。有一种进口的操纵箱，被称为机床的心脏，但是使用很不灵便。工人主张动手术，“权威”认为动不得。工人们为了生产的需要，坚决冲破“权威”的阻挠，从一九五三年以来先后给这个操纵箱开了八次刀。现在这个操纵箱的零件大大简化，重量从四十五公斤减到五、六公斤，性能赶上和超过了世界先进水平。而当工人“动手术”大功告成以后，原来坚持“动不得”的“权威”们，却又盗窃工人的革新成果，写论文，开会议，偷偷地把自己塞上世界液压“权威”的宝座。
    装配工人胡克伟和青年技术员朱祖根，举了“权威”们设计的一种平面磨床的例子。这个磨床上的一个磨头，造了八年，始终没造成。“权威”们组织了几次攻关，做了三十几只磨头，什么“章氏磨头”、“吴氏磨头”、“张氏磨头”，不一而足，就是解决不了生产上真正需要的磨头。什么原因呢？原来，这些“权威”不是真正攻磨头，而是“我”字当了头，勾心斗角，争名夺利，别人的意见听不进，工人的意见更不屑听，旷日持久，一事无成，白白浪费了八年光阴。去年设计革命运动中，厂领导组织了以工人为主的“三结合”攻关队，几个月就解决了问题。
    事实最雄辩，实践最权威。工人们和青年技术人员们从一件一件的事实和一次一次的实践中，得出了结论：脱离实际脱离群众的资产阶级“权威”，信的是“奴才哲学”，走的是“爬行路线”，丢了洋拐棍寸步难行，离开洋本本不能活命。名利思想迷住了他们的心窍，洋框框压死了他们的聪明。靠他们，设计就不能创新，产品就无法革命。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人群众登上了产品设计的舞台，才能创自己的风格，走自己的道路，迅速赶上和超过世界先进水平。
