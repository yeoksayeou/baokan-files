Chairman Mao said: People are bound to die, but the significance of death varies. To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists, to die for those who exploit and oppress the people, is lighter than a feather.

	Always thinking of the people, one fears neither hardship nor death.

	Jiang Shusong (Militia Camp Commander of a Brigade): Different standpoints lead to different views on life and death. "Living in the world, for one's body and mouth," "people die for money, birds die for food" are the views on life and death of the exploiting class; living and dying for the people's interests is the view of the proletariat.

	Before studying Chairman Mao's works, I often thought about how to eat well and dress well. Having bourgeois ideas in my head made me afraid of hardship and death. I didn't dare go swimming in the pond, fearing both catching a cold and drowning.

	After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," my consciousness was raised. I thought: Without people like Zhang Zide who serve the people, we poor and lower-middle peasants would not have been liberated; now that we are liberated, we should serve the people like Zhang Zide did. Last November, I led more than thirty team members to help four brigades transport timber to Hengyang Port. As the timber raft passed through the Le River mouth, the waves were high, and we had to row against the current, expending great effort to reach Cha Mountain. At this point, the tow rope broke, and the timber raft drifted back more than ten miles, almost retreating to the Le River mouth. I thought: If it hits the iron bridge pier, the collective timber and the lives of dozens of team members will be in great danger. So, I jumped into the river without hesitation to rescue the timber raft. The team members followed suit, all jumping into the river to fight against the waves and cold currents. After more than an hour of struggle, we finally rescued the timber raft. Someone asked me, "In the past, you didn't dare go swimming in the pond in the summer, so why do you dare jump into the river to rescue the timber raft in such cold weather?" I said, "In the past, I thought of myself, so I was afraid of death; now, I always think of the people, so I am not afraid of death!"

	Hu Meixiang (Women's Team Leader of Xiawan Production Team): Everyone will die sooner or later. It depends on what you die for. Dying like Zhang Zide for the people is glorious; dying like the landlords and constables of the past is worthless.

	The more you fear death, the smaller your courage; the less you fear death, the greater your courage. Last November, one night, I got up to help my child urinate. I saw two cows' shadows on the railway tracks in front of the door; then, I heard the train whistle. I was very worried: if the train hits the cows, the cows will die, the train will derail, and what will happen? To lead the cows away is very dangerous. At this moment, I remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "We think of the people's interests, we think of the suffering of the majority of the people. We die for the people, and we die a worthwhile death." Instantly, I gained courage. I didn't care about the cold, wearing only a single set of clothes and shorts, I quickly ran onto the railway, leading the cows away. Just as I led the cows off the railway, a freight train came. After the train safely passed, I led the cows, walking through three production teams, and handed the cows over to the livestock keeper before I could rest assured and go back home.

### 时刻想着人民就不怕苦不怕死

    毛主席说：人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。……为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。
    时刻想着人民就不怕苦不怕死
    蒋述松（大队民兵营长）：立场不同，对待生死的看法就不一样。“人在世上走，为了身和口”、“人为财死，鸟为食亡”，是剥削阶级的生死观；为人民利益而生，为人民利益而死，是无产阶级的生死观。
    没有学习毛主席著作以前，我常常想的是：怎样吃得好，穿得好。头脑里有了资产阶级思想，就贪生怕死。下塘洗澡，我也不敢去，一怕受凉，二怕淹死。
    学习《为人民服务》以后，觉悟提高了。我想：没有张思德这样为人民服务的人，我们贫下中农就不能解放；今天我们解放了，就要像张思德那样为人民服务。去年十一月间，我带了三十多个社员，帮助四个大队到衡阳港运木排。木排划过耒河口，风浪大，又是逆着水划，费了很大力气才划到茶山坳。这时，纤索断了，木排倒退了十多里，眼看就要退到耒河口。我想：要是碰上铁桥墩，集体的木材，几十个社员的生命，都会有很大的危险。于是，我就不顾一切，跳到河里抢救木排，社员们接着也都跟着跳下河，与风浪、寒流作斗争。经过一个多小时的搏斗，终于把木排抢救回来了。有人问我：“过去热天你不敢下塘洗澡，现在这么冷的天，为什么敢下河抢救木排？”我说：“过去想的是个人，怕死；现在时刻想的是人民，就不怕死了！”
    胡美香（下湾生产队妇女队长）：人迟早是要死的。就看你是为那个死。像张思德那样为人民而死，就光荣；像过去那些地主、保长，死了就当不得一只狗。
    越是怕死，胆子越小；不怕死了，胆子就大了。去年十一月一天，深更半夜，我起来给小孩催尿，远远看见门前铁路上有两头牛的影子；接着，又听到火车叫。我心里好着急：火车碰上牛，牛会死，车会翻，怎么得了？要去牵牛，又很危险。这时，我想起了毛主席的教导：“我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”顿时增添了胆量。我顾不得冷，穿着一身单衣短裤，飞快跑上铁路，把牛牵下来。刚把牛牵下铁路，一列货车开过来了。火车安全过去后，我又牵着牛，走了三个生产队，把牛交到饲养员手里，才放心回家。
