Although we live and work in areas filled with the sound of gunfire and bullets, we often hear the voice of Beijing. It has the effect of inspiring us to continue our struggle. We see that socialist China enthusiastically supports the revolution of the people of South Vietnam, which fills us with confidence to move forward. The comrades here often say: China is such a dear friend, worthy of our respect, just as Chairman Hu said: "Deep gratitude, deep friendship, and long-lasting affection." The people of South Vietnam cannot express our gratitude to you enough.

    我们有了义重情长的朋友
    虽然在枪林弹雨地区生活和工作，但我们还是经常听到北京的声音，它起着激励我们继续战斗的作用。我们看到社会主义中国热情地支持越南南方人民的革命，使我们充满信心不断前进。我们这里的同志经常谈论说：中国这样的朋友真可爱，值得我们尊敬，正如胡主席所说的：“恩深义重情长”。我们越南南方人民对你们的感激是无法说完的。　越南南方　梅同
