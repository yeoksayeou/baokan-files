	Sunflowers bloom towards the sun,
	Soldiers carry Chairman Mao's works,
	Each squad studies them,
	Each person is a little tiger,
	Each person has the world in their heart.

	Soldiers carry Chairman Mao's works,
	Each gun is raised,
	Each shot hits the enemy's heart,
	Each obstacle is overcome.

	Soldiers carry Chairman Mao's works,
	Each red pen is wielded,
	Each black line is cut off,
	Each demon is trampled underfoot.

	Soldiers carry Chairman Mao's works,
	Each word is read seriously,
	Each red heart is devoted to the Party,
	Each step moves forward forever.

	Soldiers carry Chairman Mao's works,
	Each truth is remembered in the heart,
	Each step follows Chairman Mao,
	Sunflowers bloom towards the sun.

    一朵朵葵花向阳开
    战士　言云一本本毛主席著作身上带，一队队战士学起来，一个个都是小老虎，一个个胸怀全世界。一本本毛主席著作身上带，一支支钢枪举起来，一枪枪命中敌心窝，一道道难关都劈开。一本本毛主席著作身上带，一支支红笔挥起来，一条条黑线都砍断，一个个妖怪脚下踩。一本本毛主席著作身上带，一句句认真读起来，一颗颗红心齐向党，一步步永远朝前迈。一本本毛主席著作身上带，一条条真理记心怀，一步步紧跟毛主席，一朵朵葵花向阳开。
