Recently, the head of American imperialism, Johnson, made a trip to Asia. He convened the Manila black meeting, "visited" New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, "Malaysia," and the puppet regimes of South Vietnam and South Korea. He hatched a grand conspiracy to extinguish the revolutionary flames of Vietnam, oppose China, and enslave Asia. Now, this great plague has rolled back to his lair amidst the angry shouts of the people of various Asian countries.

Johnson's Asia trip is a major sign of the shift in the strategic focus of American imperialism to the East. The American propaganda machine compares today's policy of aggression in Asia to Truman's policy in Europe after World War II, which is not accidental. Back then, American imperialism started by suppressing the Greek revolution, rallying the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military invasion line, and implementing the so-called "Marshall Plan," concentrating forces in Europe to "contain" the Soviet Union. Today, with the Soviet revisionist leadership carrying out a thorough betrayal, the Asian revolution surging to unprecedented heights, and China stronger than ever, American imperialism has made socialist China its main enemy and shifted its strategic focus to Asia. Johnson intends to recreate a "Truman Doctrine" in Asia to save American imperialism from its final doom.

Johnson's main points on his trip can be summarized as follows:

First, for the time being, the United States intends to use the tactics of escalating war and "forcing peace through war" to strangle the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. The Manila conference's communiqué fully exposed this plot. The ultimate goal of American imperialism in suppressing the Vietnamese revolution is, of course, to crush the national liberation movements in Asia and to attack China.

Second, he shouted that the United States will use a "military shield" in Asia to "assume responsibilities," "resist aggression," and "contain" China, and so on. This means that American imperialism is not willing to accept its failures in Asia and will make a desperate struggle, determined to use its counter-revolutionary violence to resist the revolutionary tide in Asia and deal with socialist China.

Third, he peddled the so-called "new Asian community" and "regional cooperation in Asia and the Pacific," and talked a lot about the United States' supposed "aid" to Asian vassals and puppets. It is obvious that another important purpose of Johnson's Asia trip is to cobble together a new anti-China alliance to replace the disintegrating Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The Manila conference is the first step in implementing this conspiracy.

This is the blueprint for the U.S. policy of aggression in Asia that Johnson carried in his briefcase. The target of this blueprint is directly aimed at China. Johnson's Asia trip is a manifestation of American imperialism's mad hostility towards China and a brazen provocation against the Chinese people and the people of Asia.

During his trip, Johnson sang high praises about "peace," "construction," "prosperity," "revival," "economic, social, and cultural cooperation," and "smashing poverty, ignorance, and disease," and so on. All of these are lies. Johnson is pushing a plan of aggression in Asia under the cover of "peace," using dollars to buy Asian vassals and drive them to act as anti-China tools, and intensifying preparations for a military attack on China.

In addition to militarily encircling and threatening China, American imperialism still dreams of using the "peaceful evolution" tactic to overthrow China. On October 17, Johnson, in his speech at the "East-West Center" in Honolulu, openly incited the use of a so-called "practical and sympathetic spirit" to defeat "outdated dogmatism" in China. The United States hopes for "freer exchanges" with China. American newspapers admitted that Johnson's remarks were directed at those "anti-Mao Zedong elements" within China. Johnson's so-called "outdated dogmatism" refers to the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This American imperialist's rock-solid head still hopes that one day the counter-revolutionary revisionists in China will carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration.

American imperialism's plan of aggression in Asia and its mad anti-China stance are actively encouraged and closely coordinated by the Soviet revisionist leadership. According to American newspapers, the "withdrawal" plot played at the Manila black meeting is the product of U.S.-Soviet collusion. And as Johnson's Asia trip was about to end, Brezhnev publicly issued anti-China rhetoric. The traitorous acts of the Soviet leadership have emboldened the likes of Johnson in their aggression.

However, Johnson is still dreaming the "Truman Doctrine" in the Asia of the 1960s. He has obviously chosen the wrong place, the wrong time, and the wrong target.

American imperialism not only cannot extinguish the revolutionary flames of Vietnam but is also sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of the Vietnam War, facing a dead end. The entire Asia is a volcano ready to erupt. The storm of anti-American struggles is rising. The flames of people's wars are raging. American imperialism will face not just one South Vietnam in Asia! The U.S. bases of aggression in Asia are rapidly collapsing. A great China of 700 million people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stands firmly on the Asian continent, becoming the pillar and an unshakable fortress of the struggle against imperialism by the people of Asia and the world, and an insurmountable obstacle to American imperialism's global counter-revolutionary strategy.

American imperialism's attempt to cobble together an anti-China line in Asia, to encircle China, is on the one hand to suppress the anti-American struggles of the Vietnamese and Asian peoples and launch an attack on China, but on the other hand, those Asian countries dragged into the anti-China line will be the first to suffer from American aggression, slavery, and control. American imperialism is using the pretext of anti-China to establish military bases in many Asian countries and regions, dispatch invasion troops, and carry out brutal aggression and oppression. This cannot but ignite the anti-American fury of the peoples of various Asian countries and make the American aggressors themselves fall into the encirclement of the Asian peoples.

Johnson's Asia trip this time almost resulted in anti-American demonstrations and protests wherever he went. Johnson's trip to Asia was like a rat crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat it. The gunshots of the South Vietnamese and Thai peoples scared Johnson to death. In the middle of his trip, the successful launch of China's missile and nuclear weapons made Johnson even more miserable! American imperialism in Asia is doomed, and there is no turning back.

Chairman Mao once pointed out: "It is not others but the Americans themselves who manufacture this noose and put it around their own necks, while handing the other end of the noose to the Chinese people, the Arab peoples, and all peace-loving and anti-aggression peoples of the world." The situation is exactly like this. The more American imperialism madly opposes China and intensifies its aggression in Asia, the more it tightens the noose around the neck of American imperialism that the Chinese people and the peoples of various Asian countries are pulling. The day of American imperialism's burial will not be long. The peoples of the entire Asia and the world will surely hang the wicked American imperialism!

    强盗的脖子和人民的绞索
    ——评约翰逊的亚洲之行
    观察家
    最近，美帝国主义头子约翰逊，到亚洲来走了一趟。他召集了马尼拉的黑会，“访问”了新西兰、澳大利亚、菲律宾、泰国、“马来西亚”等仆从国家和南越、南朝鲜傀儡政权。他策划了一个扑灭越南革命烈火、反对中国和奴役亚洲的大阴谋。现在，这个大瘟神已经在亚洲各国人民的怒逐声中，滚回他的老窝去了。
    约翰逊的这次亚洲之行，是美帝国主义战略重点东移的一个重大标志。美国宣传机器把约翰逊今天侵略亚洲的政策，比作第二次世界大战后杜鲁门的对欧政策，这并不是偶然的。当年，美帝国主义从扑灭希腊革命的烈火着手，纠集北大西洋集团军事侵略阵线，推行所谓“马歇尔计划”，集中力量在欧洲“遏制”苏联。今天，在苏联修正主义领导集团实行彻底大叛卖、亚洲革命空前高涨和中国空前强大的情况下，美帝国主义已经把社会主义的中国当作它的主要敌人，把它的战略重点转移到了亚洲。约翰逊企图在亚洲重新炮制出一个“杜鲁门主义”，来挽救美帝国主义最后灭亡的命运。
    约翰逊一路上大讲特讲的，归结起来，无非是这样三条：
    第一，就当前来说，美国要以扩大战争冒险和“以战迫和”的把戏来扼杀越南人民的抗美救国斗争。马尼拉会议的公报集中地暴露了这个阴谋。美帝国主义扼杀越南革命的进一步的目的，当然是为了镇压亚洲的民族解放运动，为了进攻中国。
    第二，叫嚷美国要以“军事盾牌”在亚洲“承担义务”，“抵抗侵略”，“遏制”中国，等等。这就是说，美帝国主义不甘心于它在亚洲遭到的失败，要在亚洲进行拚死的挣扎，决心用它的反革命暴力，来抵挡亚洲革命的洪流，对付社会主义的中国。
    第三，大肆兜售所谓“亚洲新的共同体”、亚洲和太平洋“区域合作”，大谈美国对亚洲仆从和傀儡的所谓“援助”。很显然，约翰逊亚洲之行的另一个重要目的是，拼凑一个新的反华联盟，以取代支离破碎的东南亚条约组织。马尼拉会议就是实现这个阴谋的第一步。
    这就是约翰逊皮包里的美国侵略亚洲政策的蓝图。这个蓝图的矛头是直接指向中国的。约翰逊的亚洲之行，是美帝国主义疯狂敌视中国的表现，是对中国人民和亚洲人民的猖狂挑衅。
    约翰逊在他的行程中，高唱什么“和平”、“建设”、“繁荣”、“复兴”、“经济、社会和文化合作”，什么“粉碎贫穷、愚昧和疾病”等等。所有这些，统统都是鬼话。约翰逊在亚洲推行的是以“和平”为烟幕来掩盖其扩大战争冒险的阴谋计划，是用美元来收买亚洲的仆从，驱使它们充当反华工具，加紧准备对中国发动军事进攻。
    美帝国主义除了对中国进行军事包围和武力威胁之外，仍然幻想用“和平演变”的一手，来颠覆中国。约翰逊十月十七日在檀香山“东西方中心”的演说中，公开煽动在中国用所谓“实际的和富于同情心的精神战胜过时的教条主义”。美国希望同中国有“较自由的交流”。美国报纸直认不讳地说，约翰逊的这番话是说给中国国内那些“反毛泽东的人”听的。约翰逊所谓的“过时的教条主义”，就是指的伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想。这个美帝国主义分子的花冈岩脑袋，至今仍然指望中国的反革命修正主义分子有朝一日在中国实行反革命复辟。
    美帝国主义推行亚洲侵略计划，疯狂反华，是得到苏联修正主义领导集团的积极鼓励和密切配合的。据美国报纸透露，马尼拉黑会所玩弄的“撤军”阴谋，就是美苏密谋的产物。而在约翰逊的亚洲行程即将结束的时候，勃列日涅夫竟公然发出反华叫嚣。苏联领导集团的叛徒行径，助长了约翰逊之流的侵略气焰。
    但是，约翰逊在六十年代的亚洲，还在做着“杜鲁门主义”的迷梦。他显然是找错了地点，看错了时间，碰错了对象。
    美帝国主义不仅无法扑灭越南革命的烈火，而且在侵越战争中正越陷越深，处于穷途末路。整个亚洲是一座岩浆迸发的大火山。反美斗争的风暴不断兴起。人民战争烽火连天。美帝国主义将要在亚洲面临的岂止是一个南越！美国在亚洲的侵略阵地正在迅速地土崩瓦解。一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的七亿人口的强大的中国，屹立在亚洲大陆上，成为亚洲人民和全世界人民反对帝国主义斗争的中流砥柱和坚不可摧的革命堡垒，成为美帝国主义推行反革命全球战略的不可逾越的障碍。
    美帝国主义在亚洲拼凑反华阵线，包围中国，一方面固然是为了镇压越南和亚洲人民的反美斗争和发动对中国的进攻，但另一方面，那些被拉进反华阵线的亚洲国家，首当其冲地遭到美国的侵略、奴役和控制。美帝国主义正是以反华为借口，在亚洲许多国家和地区遍布军事基地，派驻侵略军队，进行残暴的侵略和压迫。这就不能不激起亚洲各国人民的反美怒火，不能不使美国侵略者自己陷入亚洲人民的重重包围之中。
    约翰逊这次亚洲之行，几乎是走到哪里，哪里的人民就举行反美游行示威，向约翰逊进行强烈的抗议。约翰逊到亚洲来，活像一只过街的老鼠，人人喊打。南越人民和泰国人民的枪声，使约翰逊吓破了胆。在他的行程中途，中国人民成功地发射了导弹核武器，更使约翰逊大倒其霉！美帝国主义在亚洲，大势已去，再也无法挽回了。
    毛主席曾经指出：“不是别人而是美国人自己制造这种绞索，并把它套在自己的脖子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了中国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱和平反侵略的人民。”事情正是这样。美帝国主义越是疯狂地反华，越是加紧侵略亚洲，就越使中国人民和亚洲各国人民拉紧套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索。美帝国主义被埋葬的日子不会太长了。全亚洲人民和全世界人民，最后一定要对万恶的美帝国主义处以绞刑！
