Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution have made great strides in destroying the Four Olds and establishing the Four News, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters. They have truly earned the title of Chairman Mao's Red Guards.

The Red Guards have also responded to Chairman Mao's call to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers in the midst of struggle. Recently, some Red Guards came to Dazhai to visit and learn, helping with the autumn harvest. They asked us to share the history of our village and families, to recall bitterness and sweetness, and to help them raise their class consciousness.

The people of Dazhai have suffered greatly in the old society. I will share just two incidents: In 1920, a natural disaster struck, and the landlords and reactionary government intensified their oppression and exploitation. Many families were torn apart, and homes were destroyed. In a village of 180 people, 40 died of starvation, fled as refugees, or were sold into slavery. In 1940, the Japanese invaders came, and in Dazhai alone, more than 30 young and strong villagers were buried alive by these bandits. These two disasters cost the village a total of 80 lives. At the time of liberation, most of the remaining villagers were women and old men, with only about 30 able-bodied laborers. The land was barren, with the best fields yielding only about 100 jin of grain per mu. Under these conditions, to revolt and rebuild our homes, to engage in socialist construction, was truly difficult! But we had the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, taking class struggle as the key link, and waged a tough battle against nature. Now, the village has more than 120 able-bodied laborers. Production has undergone a tremendous change.

The Red Guards, after hearing these stories and seeing the new face of Dazhai, were deeply moved. They said, "We grew up in the new society and only know sweetness, not bitterness. From movies and books, we know a little about the darkness of the old society, but the impression is not deep. Now, hearing the words of those who suffered in the past and seeing the new face of the village, we have received a profound education." They vowed not to forget class bitterness, to remember blood debts, and to definitely carry on the revolutionary cause of their predecessors, to defend our red homeland.

In labor, the Red Guards are very hardworking and endure hardship. They eagerly take on dirty and heavy work. The villagers all praise them. This is how Red Guards should be. To understand class struggle, one must also understand production struggle and scientific experimentation. Only by working with workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants, enduring hardship, and sweating, can one know where grain comes from, where clothes come from, and where a happy life comes from. Participating in class struggle and production labor, from one practice to another, one can become familiar with society and the masses, and gain more experience.

We workers and peasants were once trampled underfoot by landlords and capitalists. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to revolt and seek liberation, we would not have today. Now, Chairman Mao is leading us in the Cultural Revolution, fighting against those in power who are taking the capitalist road, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and preventing capitalist restoration, all to prevent landlords and capitalists from having the chance to ride roughshod over the people again. In this great revolution, we poor and lower-middle peasants stand united with the Red Guards. Our hearts are with Chairman Mao, and we listen to Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao wants the Red Guards to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers. We poor and lower-middle peasants also want to learn from the daring and pioneering revolutionary spirit of the Red Guard cadres. Let us learn from each other, advance together on the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

### 熟悉社会，熟悉群众，才懂得阶级斗争

专栏：和红卫兵谈心

    熟悉社会，熟悉群众，才懂得阶级斗争
    山西省昔阳县大寨大队贫协主任　贾进才
    红卫兵小将们在这场文化大革命中，破四旧，立四新，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，立下了很大功劳。革命小将们真不愧是毛主席的红卫兵。
    红卫兵还响应毛主席的号召，在斗争中向工农兵学习。不久以前，有的红卫兵到大寨来参观学习，帮助秋收。他们要我们讲村史、家史，忆苦思甜，帮助他们提高无产阶级觉悟。
    我们大寨人，在旧社会受的苦是说不完的。这里只说两件事：一九二○年遭受天灾，地主、反动政府加紧压迫、剥削，许多人家妻离子散，家破人亡。全村一百八十多口人，饿死的，加上逃荒和卖儿卖女的，少掉了四十多个人。一九四○年，日本鬼子来了，大寨一个村子，就被这些强盗活埋了三十多个青壮年。这两次灾难，全村共丧失了八十多口人。解放的时候，村里剩下的大部分是妇女和老汉，只有三十多个壮劳动力。地也瘦了，最好的地每亩只打一百多斤粮食。在这种情况下闹翻身，重建家园，搞社会主义建设，真不容易啊！但是，我们有党和毛主席的领导，以阶级斗争为纲，同大自然展开了艰苦的斗争。现在，全村的劳动力就有一百二十多个。生产更是有了翻天覆地的变化。
    红卫兵听了这些历史，再看看大寨今天的新面貌，感动极了。他们说：我们生长在新社会，只知道甜，不知道苦。从电影和书上知道一些旧社会的黑暗，但印象不深。现在亲耳听到过去的受苦人说的话，亲眼看到村子里的新面貌，受到了很深的教育。他们表示不忘阶级苦，永记血泪仇，一定要接好革命前辈的班，保住我们红色的江山。
    红卫兵在劳动当中，很能吃苦耐劳，脏活累活抢着干。社员们都夸奖他们。红卫兵就是要这样。要懂得阶级斗争，也要懂得生产斗争和科学实验。只有同工人、贫农、下中农在一起吃点苦，流点汗，才能知道粮食从哪里来，衣服从哪里来，幸福生活从哪里来。参加阶级斗争，又参加生产劳动，从这个实践到那个实践，就能熟悉社会，熟悉群众，经验就多了。
    我们工人农民，过去被地主、资本家踩在脚底下。没有共产党、毛主席领导我们起来闹翻身，求解放，就没有今天。现在，毛主席又领导我们搞文化大革命，斗争党内走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，目的就是不让地主、资本家再有机会骑在人民头上。在这场大革命中，我们贫下中农同红卫兵是一条心。咱们的心都向着毛主席，都听毛主席的话。毛主席要红卫兵向工农兵学习。我们贫下中农也要学习红卫兵小将敢闯敢干的革命精神。让我们互相学习，共同按毛主席指引的道路前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
