The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice calling on all military personnel and militia to widely publicize and learn from the glorious deeds of Comrade Cai Yongxiang. The full text of the notice is as follows:

Comrade Cai Yongxiang, a great communist warrior who puts the public first, bravely sacrificed himself to remove obstacles set by class enemies and to rescue and transport a special train for the Red Guards. Comrade Cai Yongxiang is a great hero nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, a loyal defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a model for caring for the Red Guards, and a hero who gave his life for the safety of the Red Guards. He is truly a good son of the Chinese people and a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang's short life was a brilliant one, completely and thoroughly dedicated to the people. Before his death, he took Lei Feng as his model, learned from heroes, walked the path of heroes, and created extraordinary achievements in ordinary work, doing many good deeds beneficial to the people and the revolution. In critical moments, he fearlessly stepped forward and, without hesitation, sacrificed his life to rescue his class brothers. His death for the people is heavier than Mount Tai. He will forever live in our hearts.

The fundamental reason for Comrade Cai Yongxiang's rapid growth into a great communist warrior is that he actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, worked hard on his words and deeds, constantly carried out revolution in the depths of his soul, thoroughly transformed his worldview, and established a great communist ideology of putting the public first. Comrade Cai Yongxiang is an outstanding representative of a new generation of people nurtured under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang's glorious deeds should be widely publicized within and outside the military, and all personnel of our army and the militia should learn from him.

In learning from Comrade Cai Yongxiang, we must resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, achieve new levels in learning and application, and study the "Three Articles" seriously to constantly transform our worldview and establish a great communist ideology of putting the public first. We should further realize the revolutionization of our thoughts, as Chairman Mao teaches us, to become noble, pure, moral, and disinterested people who are beneficial to the people.

In learning from Comrade Cai Yongxiang, we must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, guard against the sabotage activities of class enemies, and bravely defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and resolutely oppose the bourgeois reactionary line, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must strengthen our preparedness for war, prevent sudden attacks by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and if they dare to invade us, we will break their spines and completely, thoroughly, and cleanly wipe them out.

In learning from Comrade Cai Yongxiang, we must love Chairman Mao infinitely, be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to the revolutionary cause of the Party and the people, thus achieving more brilliant victories in the revolutionary and combat-ready construction of our army and in the national defense construction of our country.

    向毛主席的好战士蔡永祥同志学习
    要像蔡永祥同志那样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想。要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，认真学习“老三篇”，树立一心为公的共产主义世界观。
    新华社十七日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部，最近发出通知，要求全军指战员和广大民兵，广泛宣传和学习蔡永祥同志的光荣事迹。通知全文如下：
    一心为公的伟大的共产主义战士蔡永祥同志，为了排除阶级敌人设下的障碍，抢救运送红卫兵的专车而英勇献身。蔡永祥同志是毛泽东思想哺育下成长的伟大的欧阳海式的英雄，是无产阶级文化大革命的忠诚保卫者，是爱护红卫兵的模范，为了红卫兵的安全，牺牲了自己的性命。他不愧为中国人民的好儿子，毛主席的好战士。
    蔡永祥同志短暂的一生，是完全、彻底为人民的光辉的一生。他生前以雷锋为榜样，学英雄的思想，走英雄的道路，在平凡的工作中创造不平凡的业绩，做了大量有益于人民、有益于革命的好事；在紧急关头，他临危不惧，挺身而出，为抢救阶级兄弟毫不犹豫地献出自己的生命。他为人民而死，比泰山还重。他将永远活在我们的心中。
    蔡永祥同志迅速地成长为伟大的共产主义战士的根本原因，在于他活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，不断在自己的灵魂深处闹革命，彻底改造自己的世界观，树立了一心为公的伟大的共产主义思想。蔡永祥同志是毛泽东思想光辉照耀下成长起来的一代新人的杰出代表。
    蔡永祥同志的光荣事迹，应该在军队内外进行广泛宣传，并要发动我军全体人员和广大民兵向他学习。
    学习蔡永祥同志，我们要坚决响应林副主席的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段，学出新水平，用出新水平。要认真学习“老三篇”，不断改造世界观，树立一心为公的共产主义思想，进一步实现思想革命化，像毛主席教导我们那样，做一个高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。
    学习蔡永祥同志，我们要保持高度的革命警惕性，严防阶级敌人的破坏活动，英勇地保卫无产阶级文化大革命；坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决反对资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。要加强战备，防止美帝国主义及其帮凶的突然袭击，如果它们胆敢侵犯我们，我们就要打断侵略者的脊骨，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它们消灭掉。
    学习蔡永祥同志，我们要无限地热爱毛主席，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于党和人民的革命事业，从而使我军的革命化、战斗化建设和我国的国防建设事业取得更加辉煌的胜利。
