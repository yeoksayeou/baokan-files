The Qinghai Plateau has successfully raised mink.

Mink is a highly valuable fur animal, originally from Northeast China. In 1959, mink were brought to Qinghai, but they did not adapt well to the environment, were prone to disease, had low birth rates, and the offspring had low survival rates. Through careful observation and research by the breeding staff, a set of experiences was developed to control animal diseases, improve the birth rate of female mink, and increase the survival rate of offspring. They also experimented with feeding mink the scaleless fish from Qinghai Lake, achieving good results. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    青海高原试养水貂成功了。
    水貂是一种经济价值极高的珍贵皮毛兽，原产我国东北。一九五九年水貂引到青海后，生活不适应，容易生病，母兽产仔少，仔兽不易成活。由于饲养人员细心观察研究，终于摸索到一套控制兽病，提高母兽产仔率和提高仔兽成活率的经验。他们并试验以青海湖的无鳞鱼饲养水貂，获得良好的效果。（据新华社讯）
