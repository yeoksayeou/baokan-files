We are the people by Chairman Mao's side, so naturally, we should enthusiastically welcome the guests Chairman Mao has invited.

The revolutionary masses of Fuchang Alley, with such a spirit, have since September 8th, meticulously and thoughtfully received batch after batch of revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards from outside Beijing. They regard the reception work as a glorious political mission.

The neighborhood committee director leads by example, putting her heart into the reception work. Whatever the reception station needs, if her family has it, she lends it to the station. Under her leadership, the reception station only bought one pot, and all other utensils were gathered from various households. Many elderly men and women eagerly came to the station to do reception work.

On November 11th, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected the Cultural Revolution army for the seventh time. The comrades at the reception station were as happy as during the Spring Festival, busily preparing from the day before. Two retired old workers stayed up all night steaming steamed buns and boiling water for the revolutionary youngsters, not closing their eyes for a moment.

In the morning, the neighborhood committee director led a group of people to set up a tea station near Ba Mian Gou, enthusiastically handing out bowls of rice soup to the Red Guards marching towards Tiananmen Square.

When the revolutionary youngsters accepted Chairman Mao's inspection and enthusiastically cheered for the great leader, the comrades at the reception station were already busy preparing meals for them. In the evening, the Red Guard youngsters, filled with the joy of meeting the great leader Mao Zedong, jumped and skipped back to the reception station. The meals, more delicious than usual, were already prepared. Many youngsters said while eating, "The Party and Chairman Mao take such good care of us!"

An elderly military family member, in the old society, started working as a servant for the landlord at the age of 16. At that time, she cooked for the landlord all day, working herself to the bone, and never had a full meal. After liberation, she stood up politically, and her life improved day by day. Now, she is cooking for the guests Chairman Mao has invited, comparing the two societies and two scenarios, she has boundless energy. Over the past two months, she has been busy day and night. Others told her, "You are old and your health is not good, rest more!" She replied, "Serving the revolutionary youngsters, serving the Cultural Revolution, it feels great in my heart, even small ailments are gone!"

The revolutionary masses of the Fuchang Alley reception station often study the "Three Articles" and learn from the examples of Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune, completely and thoroughly serving the revolutionary youngsters. Every batch of Red Guards they receive writes letters of thanks when they leave. Some praise them as good servants of the people, and some praise them as living examples of Lei Feng. At this time, they repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "Modesty makes progress, arrogance leads to backwardness," seriously examine their work, and strive to serve the revolutionary youngsters better.

    街道革命居民的心愿
    我们是毛主席身边的人，当然应该热情地接待毛主席请来的客人。
    富强胡同的革命群众本着这样的心意，从九月八日以来，细心周到地接待了一批又一批外地来京的革命师生和红卫兵。他们把接待工作看做是一项光荣的政治任务。
    居民委员会主任以身作则，为接待工作尽心出力。接待站需要什么东西，凡是她家里有的，就拿来借给站上使用。在她的带动下，接待站只买了一口锅，其他用具由各家一凑就准备齐全了。许多老大爷、老大娘，都争着到站上来做接待工作。
    十一月十一日，我们伟大领袖毛主席第七次检阅文化革命大军。接待站的同志们像过年过节一样，从头一天就高高兴兴地忙起来了。两位退休老工人连夜为革命小将们蒸馒头，烧开水，一宵没有合眼。
    清晨，居民委员会主任带领一批人，在八面槽附近设立了茶水站，热情地把一碗碗米汤送到向天安门广场行进的红卫兵的手里。
    当革命小将们接受毛主席的检阅，向伟大领袖热烈欢呼的时候，接待站的同志们已经在忙着为小将们做饭了。晚上，红卫兵小将们怀着见到伟大领袖毛主席的幸福激情，又蹦又跳地回到接待站，比平日更加可口的饭菜已经准备好了。许多小将一面吃饭一面说：“党和毛主席对我们照顾得多么周到啊！”
    一位军属老大娘，在旧社会十几岁就给地主做佣人。那时候，给地主整天做饭，累死累活，从来没有吃过一顿饱饭。解放以后，她政治上翻了身，生活越来越好。现在，她是在为毛主席请来的客人做饭，对比两个社会，两种情景，浑身有使不完的劲。两个月来，她不管白天黑夜，都忙个不停。别人对她说：“你年纪大了，身体又不好，多休息休息吧！”她回答说：“给革命小将们服务，给文化大革命服务，打心眼里痛快，有点小毛病也都好了！”
    富强胡同接待站的街道革命群众，经常学习“老三篇”，学习张思德、白求恩的榜样，完全、彻底地为革命小将们服务。他们接待的每一批红卫兵，临走的时候都写信感谢他们。有的表扬他们是人民的好勤务员，有的表扬他们是活雷锋。这时候，他们就反复学习毛主席关于“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，认真检查工作，争取为革命小将服务得更好。　　　　晓关
