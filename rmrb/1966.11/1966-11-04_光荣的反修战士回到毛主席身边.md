Glorious anti-revisionist warriors return to Chairman Mao's side
Capital revolutionaries and revolutionary students from various provinces enthusiastically welcome the return of our students from the Soviet Union
Beijing Station resounds with Chairman Mao's teachings: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing"

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated November 3, the 65 glorious anti-revisionist warriors, who were unreasonably ordered to return to China by the Soviet government, returned to our great motherland's capital on November 2, returning to the side of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

Tens of thousands of representatives from various revolutionary groups in the capital and Red Guards, as well as revolutionary students from all over the country who came to Beijing for revolutionary exchanges, held a grand rally at Beijing Station to enthusiastically welcome the victorious return of the glorious anti-revisionist warriors and to strongly condemn and protest the shameful actions of the Soviet government in deliberately worsening relations between China and the Soviet Union. People said: We are fiercely opposed by American imperialism, we are fiercely opposed by Soviet revisionists, this is our great, very great, and extremely great honor!

In the afternoon of the 2nd, Beijing Station was teeming with people, with red flags flying high. Banners hung on the platform read: "Strongly protest the Soviet government's unreasonable expulsion of all our students!" "Defend Marxism-Leninism and carry the struggle against modern revisionism, centered around the leadership of the CPSU, to the end!" "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" The welcoming crowd beat drums and gongs, sang revolutionary songs, and shouted slogans of welcome, eagerly awaiting the arrival of their comrades.

Friends from 30 countries on five continents who were in Beijing also held high portraits of Chairman Mao and high-held placards with Chairman Mao's quotations in Chinese, Arabic, English, French, Japanese, Spanish, and other languages, lining up at the station to welcome our students from the Soviet Union.

"Here they come! Here they come! Our comrades are back!" At 4:30 PM, as our "East Wind" international train, carrying our students from the Soviet Union, slowly pulled into Beijing Station, the sound of drums and cheers shook the heavens and the earth, and the entire station boiled with excitement. Our students from the Soviet Union, holding banners reading "Long live our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!" and other slogans, walked down from the train to thunderous applause. Deputy Minister of Higher Education, Luo Feng, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wu Youxian, Director of the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yu Zhen, and responsible officials from the Foreign Affairs Committee, Beijing Municipality, All-China Student Federation, and Beijing Student Federation, came to the front of the carriages to shake hands and embrace them warmly. The Red Guards pinned a "Red Guard" armband on each returning student and hung a shining Mao badge on their chests. At this moment, people held high portraits of Chairman Mao, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands, shouting over and over again: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

After the welcoming ceremony began at the station, all our students from the Soviet Union and the welcoming crowd sang "The East Is Red" loudly and read Chairman Mao's quotations together: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." "I think that for a person, a party, an army, or a school, if they are not opposed by the enemy, that would be bad; they must have been colluding with the enemy. If they are opposed by the enemy, that would be good; it would prove that they have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slandering us as utterly worthless, that would be even better; it would prove not only that we have drawn a clear line with the enemy but also that our work has been very successful."

Luo Feng was the first to speak at the welcoming ceremony, expressing heartfelt greetings to the returning anti-revisionist warriors and lodging the strongest protest against the Soviet government. He pointed out that the Soviet government's unreasonable expulsion of all our students was a serious incident that violated the Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation agreement, further worsened relations between China and the Soviet Union, and sparked a new wave of anti-China sentiment on a global scale.

He said that the Soviet revisionist leadership was afraid that Chinese students would spread the great Mao Zedong Thought among Soviet youth and the Soviet people. By expelling Chinese students, they once again exposed their traitorous, anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary faces.

He said that Chairman Mao taught us: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The Soviet revisionist leadership hates you and expels you, which shows that you are right and have done well; your anti-revisionist struggle has been successful. Your struggle has won the praise and support of the people of the entire nation and the support of revolutionary people all over the world.

Luo Feng encouraged all the returning students from the Soviet Union to remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "You should care about national affairs and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!" Actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, and firmly uphold the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line.

Amidst thunderous applause from the entire audience, Sun Manling, a student from the Soviet Union, made a statement on behalf of all Chinese students from the Soviet Union (the statement will be published separately). Before reading the statement, Sun Manling said excitedly, "We have returned to the great capital of our motherland, returned to Chairman Mao's side! We have a thousand words and ten thousand words to tell our people, and these words can be summed up in one sentence: Long live our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!" At this moment, the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echoed for a long time in the station.

During the reading of the statement, people repeatedly raised their fists and shouted: "Resolutely overthrow imperialism led by the United States!" "Resolutely oppose modern revisionism centered around the CPSU leadership!" "Long live the brotherly friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!"

After the welcoming ceremony, to the tune of "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman," all the students from the Soviet Union walked through the platform to meet the welcoming crowd. Representatives of Chinese embassy staff in the Soviet Union who were unreasonably recalled in 1963, and representatives of Chinese students in the Soviet Union who were brutally beaten and injured by the Soviet government during the anti-American demonstrations by foreign students in Moscow in 1965, stepped forward to welcome their comrades, shaking hands tightly and exchanging revolutionary greetings. Many Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and international friends from five continents also excitedly embraced the returning anti-revisionist warriors, expressing their condolences. People couldn't help but sing "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao," shouting "Salute to the anti-revisionist warriors," "Learn from the anti-revisionist warriors." The students from the Soviet Union also shouted in response, "Salute to the people of the motherland," "Learn from the revolutionary Red Guards." As the students from the Soviet Union boarded the train to leave the station, everyone shouted for a long time: "Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

    光荣的反修战士回到毛主席身边
    首都革命群众和各地革命师生代表最热烈地欢迎我留苏学生归来
    北京车站上响彻毛主席的教导：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”
    据新华社三日讯　光荣的反修战士，被苏联政府无理勒令回国的我国全体留苏学生六十五人，十一月二日回到了我们伟大祖国的首都，回到了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席身边。
    成千上万的首都各界革命群众代表和红卫兵小将，以及从全国各地来京串连的各族革命师生，在北京车站举行盛大集会，最热烈地欢迎光荣的反修战士们胜利归来，最强烈地谴责和抗议苏联政府蓄意恶化中苏两国关系的可耻行径。人们说：我们被美帝国主义疯狂反对，我们被苏联修正主义者疯狂反对，这是我们十分、百分、万分的光荣！
    二日下午，北京车站人如潮涌，红旗林立，站台上悬挂着一幅幅醒目的标语：“最强烈抗议苏联政府无理赶走我全部留学生！”“捍卫马克思列宁主义，把反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！”“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”前来欢迎的群众敲着锣鼓，唱着革命歌曲，呼喊着欢迎口号，热切地期待着战友们马上飞到自己身边。
    在北京的来自世界五大洲三十个国家的朋友们，也高举着毛主席像，高举着用中文、阿拉伯文、英文、法文、日文、西班牙文等各种文字写成的毛主席语录牌和大幅标语牌，列队在车站上迎候我留苏学生。
    “来了！来了！战友们回来了！”下午四时半，当我国的“东风号”国际列车，载着我留苏学生徐徐驶进北京车站时，锣鼓声和欢呼声震天动地，整个车站都沸腾起来了。我留苏学生举着“我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！”等横幅标语，在热烈的掌声中走下火车。前来欢迎的高等教育部副部长段洛夫、中国科学院副院长吴有训、外交部苏联东欧司司长余湛，以及对外文委、北京市、全国学联和北京市学联的负责人，迎到车厢前面，同他们亲切握手、拥抱。红卫兵们给每一位留苏学生戴上“红卫兵”袖章，在他们胸前佩上了金光闪闪的毛主席像纪念章。这时，人们高高举起毛主席画像，挥动着手中红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    在车站上举行的欢迎大会开始以后，我全体留苏学生和欢迎的群众一起，放声高唱《东方红》，齐声朗读毛主席语录：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”“我认为，对我们来说，一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    段洛夫首先在欢迎大会上讲话，向回国的反修战士们表示亲切的慰问，向苏联政府提出最强烈的抗议。他指出，苏联政府无理赶走我国全部留学生，是破坏中苏文化合作协定，进一步恶化中苏两国关系，掀起新的世界规模的反华高潮的一个严重事件。
    他说，苏联修正主义领导集团害怕中国留学生把伟大的毛泽东思想传播给苏联青年和苏联人民。他们赶走中国留学生，再一次暴露了他们的反华、反共、反人民、反革命的叛徒嘴脸。
    他说，毛主席教导我们说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。苏联修正主义领导集团仇视你们，赶走你们，说明你们做得对，做得好，你们反修斗争是有成绩的。你们的斗争得到了全国人民的赞扬和支持，也得到了全世界革命人民的支持。
    段洛夫勉励全体归国留苏学生牢记毛主席的教导：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”积极参加文化大革命，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想；坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。
    在全场暴风雨般的欢迎掌声中，留苏学生孙曼灵代表全体中国留苏学生发表了一项声明（声明另发）。在宣读声明之前，孙曼灵非常激动地说，我们回到伟大祖国的首都来了，回到毛主席身边来了！我们心里有千言万语要向祖国人民诉说，这千言万语并成一句话，就是：祝我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！这时，“毛主席万岁！万万岁”的欢呼声，长时间地激荡在车站上空。
    在宣读声明过程中，人们一再振臂高呼：“坚决打倒以美国为首的帝国主义！”“坚决反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义！”“中苏两国人民之间的兄弟友谊万岁！”
    欢迎大会结束以后，在《大海航行靠舵手》的乐曲声中，全体留苏学生走过月台，同欢迎的群众见面。一九六三年曾被苏联政府无理要求召回的中国驻苏联大使馆工作人员的代表，一九六五年在莫斯科外国留学生反美示威斗争中遭到苏联政府野蛮镇压殴打致伤的中国留苏学生代表，走上前去欢迎自己的战友，他们紧紧相握，互致革命的敬意。许多红卫兵小将、革命群众和来自五大洲的国际友人，也激动地同光荣归来的反修战士们亲切拥抱，向他们表示慰问。人们情不自禁地唱起《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》，高呼“向反修战士们致敬”、“向反修战士们学习”。留苏学生们也随着高呼“向祖国人民致敬”、“向革命的红卫兵学习”。留苏学生们在乘车离开车站的时候，大家长时间地高呼：“毛主席，我们心中的红太阳！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
