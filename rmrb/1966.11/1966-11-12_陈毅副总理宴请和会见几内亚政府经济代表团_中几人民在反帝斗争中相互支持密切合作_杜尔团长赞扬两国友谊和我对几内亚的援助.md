Vice Premier Chen Yi hosted a banquet and met with the Guinean government economic delegation.

The Chinese and Guinean peoples support each other closely in their anti-imperialist struggle.

Guinean delegation head Dur praises the friendship between the two countries and China's aid to Guinea.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 11th, Vice Premier Chen Yi held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome Guinean Minister of Economic Development Ismail Dur and the Guinean government economic delegation led by him.

In his speech at the banquet, Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the Guinean people for their glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle. He said that under the leadership of President Sekou Toure, the Republic of Guinea has been steadfast in opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, actively supporting the national liberation struggles of the African peoples, and dedicating itself to the cause of Asian-African unity against imperialism. Furthermore, on many major international issues, Guinea has taken a just stance and has waged unyielding struggles against foreign interference and subversive plots.

Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the remarkable progress made by the Guinean people in developing their national economy and culture. He said that the Chinese people regard the achievements of the Guinean people as their own and are genuinely delighted by them. He wished the Guinean people continued victories on their path of independent development.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the peoples of China and Guinea have forged a close combat friendship in their anti-imperialist struggles. In their struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism, in defending their national independence and state sovereignty, and in developing their national economies and cultures, the two countries have consistently supported and closely cooperated with each other. He pointed out that President Sekou Toure's visit to China in 1960 and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Guinea in 1964 have written important chapters in the history of friendly relations between the two countries. He expressed the belief that the visit to China by the Guinean government economic delegation led by Minister Ismail Dur will make new contributions to the further consolidation and development of Sino-Guinean friendly cooperation.

Minister Ismail Dur spoke at the banquet, saying that since setting foot on Chinese soil, they have lived in an atmosphere of great friendship and care, which eloquently reflects the solid friendly relations and mutual trust between the governments and peoples of the two countries.

Dur, the head of the delegation, said that since Guinea gained independence, the Chinese people, under the wise and brilliant leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have always provided us with valuable and selfless aid in all respects, maintained and developed fair cooperation with our country, and each time given us firm and effective support. Therefore, our people highly appreciate it. I want to convey the heartfelt thanks of the Guinean government, people, and beloved leader Ahmed Sekou Toure to the Chinese government and people and their leader Chairman Mao Zedong.

He said that the solid friendly relations between the peoples of China and Guinea are being further strengthened. This friendly connection is based on our effective struggle against the common enemy of the peoples of all countries—imperialism and old and new colonialism.

He said that with the true pride of the peoples of Asia and Africa, we once again warmly congratulate the Chinese people on the successful launch of the missile nuclear weapon. The Guinean people are genuinely delighted by the brilliant victory of their brotherly Chinese people and regard it as their own victory.

He said that recently, when our delegation was kidnapped by the puppet regime of Ghana, which is nurtured by imperialism, we received full support from the Chinese government, and we express our heartfelt thanks for this.

Those who attended the banquet to accompany the guests included Yang Lin, Li Yimang, Qi Pengfei, Lu Xiuzhang, Shi Huaipei, Ding Xilin, and other relevant officials.

Members of the Guinean government economic delegation, Guinean Ambassador to China Kamara Segou, and some African diplomatic envoys to China were also invited to attend.
