Chairman Mao is with us,
Thunderous cheers shake the earth,
Mountains dance and seas sing,
Red flags flutter across the blue sky for ten thousand miles.

Chairman Mao is with us,
Sunlight illuminates millions of miles,
We fear not the raging winds and waves,
A red lighthouse stands firm in our hearts.

Chairman Mao is with us,
Wherever we go, there are no enemies,
We capture dragons, subdue tigers, and slay demons,
The three mountains and five ridges change the world.

Chairman Mao is with us,
Revolution marches towards new victories,
The motherland's construction gallops like a fine horse,
Our strides advance a thousand miles each day!

Chairman Mao is with us,
Class struggle is forever remembered,
Raising the red flag to fight,
Treading underfoot the ghosts and snakes!

Chairman Mao is with us,
Daring to revolution, daring to win,
Destroying the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News",
Creating a fiery new era.

Chairman Mao is with us,
The revolutionary red flag is passed down through generations,
Forever following Chairman Mao,
We vow to carry the revolution through to the end!
