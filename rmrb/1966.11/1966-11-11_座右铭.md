    Motto
    A motto is an ancient form of short, rhyming prose. People write a motto to reflect on their own shortcomings or problems that need to be addressed, using it to examine and encourage themselves, and to guide their speech and actions. To show its importance, such a piece is often placed to the right of one's seat for frequent reading, hence the term "motto."

    Recently, Comrade Lin Biao issued a call: "We should study the 'Three Articles' as our motto." The "Three Articles" are short but rich in content and deeply profound. They are powerful ideological weapons for eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and for transforming people's worldviews. They are the most fundamental required course for cultivating communist new people. We should all regard the "Three Articles" as the standard for guiding our every word and deed, imprinting the thoughts from the "Three Articles" in our minds, dissolving them in our blood, and putting them into action. We must study and apply the "Three Articles" extensively, repeatedly learning and repeatedly applying them, striving to forge ourselves into noble, pure, moral individuals, free from vulgar interests, and beneficial to the people.

    座右铭
    铭，是古代一种短文，有韵。人们针对自己的缺点或需要解决的问题，写一篇铭文，用来对照、检查和勉励自己，指导自己的言论和行动。为了表示重视，常常把这种文章放在自己座位的右边，以便经常阅读，所以叫“座右铭”。
    最近，林彪同志发出号召：“要把‘老三篇’作为座右铭来学。”“老三篇”文章短小，内容极其丰富，极其深刻，是破私立公，改造人们世界观的强大思想武器，是培养共产主义新人的最根本的必修课。我们大家都应该把“老三篇”作为指导自己一切言论行动的标准，把“老三篇”里的思想印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。要大学大用“老三篇”，反复地学，反复地用，努力把自己锻炼成为高尚的人、纯粹的人、有道德的人、脱离低级趣味的人、有益于人民的人。
